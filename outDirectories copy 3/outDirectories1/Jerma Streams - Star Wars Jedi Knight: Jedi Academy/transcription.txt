[0.18s -> 16.86s]  What's up? How you doing? You doing good? Where you been? Oh, you doing that? Oh, man. Me too.
[19.78s -> 29.70s]  He's in the bathroom. I'm not in the bathroom. Sitting at my desk. I missed a huge raid?
[31.85s -> 40.36s]  Uh, I did not. I'm looking over here. I don't see anything. I was already raided. You can't raid an
[40.36s -> 56.22s]  offline channel, can you? No, you cannot. You can? You can. I did not know you could do that. You can
[56.30s -> 68.97s]  raid an offline channel. That's just dropping a bunch of people off at like an empty movie theater
[69.53s -> 76.74s]  with the screen blank. They're like, enjoy the movie, stupid. And just taking off. Like,
[76.74s -> 81.85s]  I bust you guys into a movie theater in this new movie playing. It wasn't any scheduled movie for
[81.85s -> 93.99s]  that day or that time. And then what do you do? Where do you go? You guys all like shake hands
[93.99s -> 99.19s]  and like, oh, see you later. I guess there's no movie here. And you go out of the movie theaters
[99.19s -> 107.69s]  you're in. And you start just opening up other doors to other movies. Hey, dude, dude, Force
[107.69s -> 113.61s]  Awakens is playing over here. Oh, this is not cool, man. Like 10 of you go that way. You just go in.
[114.17s -> 120.41s]  Like 40 of you go see, I don't know, what was it? Popular movie that came out like last year or two
[120.41s -> 128.92s]  years ago? Nightways? I don't know. What was that? 2010? I don't know. I don't see movies. I don't
[128.92s -> 141.18s]  know what movies have come out. Anyways, today we're gonna play Speaking of Star Wars. We're gonna
[141.18s -> 149.56s]  play Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy. This is one of the most requested games that I've gotten
[149.56s -> 157.06s]  on this channel in a long time. People are like, dude, get in that game right now. I don't care
[157.06s -> 163.13s]  what you're doing. Stop doing everything and play Jedi Academy. I played Jedi Academy multiplayer
[163.13s -> 170.78s]  with Star like six or seven years ago. I never played the actual video game. So we're gonna play
[170.78s -> 177.02s]  the out that was loud and I good thing I muted the desktop audio because a bunch of you would
[177.02s -> 186.70s]  have just flew out of your chair like I almost just did. You can thank me later. Slaughter, slaughter.
[187.34s -> 200.23s]  I love this game. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I just did. Fuck you. Fuck you. What's going on
[200.23s -> 206.42s]  here? You're gonna murder younglings. I am a youngling. So no, I'm one of the younglings.
[208.02s -> 215.40s]  Hey, easy case. Thanks for the 10 community subs and cry Thor TV. Thanks for 515 subs right here.
[215.40s -> 228.74s]  Thanks guys. He thinks he's young. I am young to heart. That's all that matters. A 35 year old man
[229.86s -> 241.19s]  and at least like 26 year old man's body. And then when I'm like 45, I'm gonna be a 45 year old man
[241.19s -> 251.38s]  in like a 32 year old body. And then when I turn 50, you're just 50. You're just 50. That's where
[251.38s -> 264.15s]  you start to become you just become old at like 50 plus other way around. No, that means I'm I look
[264.15s -> 270.57s]  young. I'm a 45 year old man and like a 32 year old man's body. Like I'm I still I look like a 32
[270.57s -> 278.95s]  year old at like 45. 40 is the new 30. Anyways, I don't give a shit what anybody says. All right,
[278.95s -> 286.76s]  let's go. Let me unmute this. The new game here make sure you have new game selected.
[288.70s -> 294.84s]  45 year old cams not on better not be killed. We got Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy.
[294.84s -> 303.72s]  I think I make a actual Star War, right? Why don't I use that as a noun? Like it was a person.
[305.29s -> 313.86s]  I okay. I'm not gonna do anything hard. Extremely difficult game, difficult game,
[313.86s -> 322.30s]  normal game or easy game. I'm just doing normal fuck all that bullshit. We go. All right. Are you
[322.30s -> 333.88s]  you buckle your seatbelt? Good. Here we go. All right. Species. Hold on. Turn on. Turn this way.
[333.88s -> 348.55s]  This is there's a character creator. Keldor male. Maybe. Rodian male. Zabrak human. Should I just be
[348.55s -> 358.71s]  a human? I feel like if you can't play a human because that's just like making a human in
[359.35s -> 364.87s]  World of Warcraft. Like I'm on my like eighth character. I guess it's going to be another
[364.87s -> 378.58s]  human. No, you don't want to make a human. Maybe I kind of do. I think I want to make a human.
[378.58s -> 391.61s]  That's so boring. But whatever. Don't fucking do it. Oh my God. But I don't know. All right. I
[391.61s -> 400.41s]  changed my mind. I think I want to be this guy. No, wait. This one. No, no, no, no, no. This one
[400.41s -> 412.78s]  is Big Rideau. I don't want to be Rideau. OK, I think this one. All right. So that's the head
[412.78s -> 425.90s]  torso. I don't want to make any more World of Warcraft references, but this is all
[426.54s -> 433.37s]  like starter gear. This is like level one tabard. I'd be level one tabard non-human
[433.37s -> 443.74s]  Rodian male. I made my own guild. I haven't even gotten the 10 signatures yet. And I tried to make
[443.74s -> 453.30s]  my own tabard. Tabard. Whatever. I'm going to make wild jokes today, I guess. Relax. Relax. Relax.
[453.30s -> 461.06s]  Oh, wow. He made a World of Warcraft joke again. It's just in the top of the mind. I don't know why.
[461.06s -> 474.41s]  What color do I want? I like the gray. Yeah. All right. Looks good. Hmm. That looks good too.
[475.05s -> 486.14s]  What do you think? This? I like those boots. This is a good setup. All right. Yeah, this is fine.
[486.30s -> 502.25s]  Oh, shit. OK, hold on. This is incredibly important. What? There's only one lightsaber?
[505.00s -> 516.73s]  Oh, man. Hold on. Which one of these do I want? All right. I kind of want the kazoo. Yeah, this
[516.73s -> 530.81s]  thing you go and you can put it in your mouth and be like, um, it's a blunt. No, just don't hold it
[530.81s -> 537.77s]  the wrong way. You press the wrong button. You don't press like the kazoo button. It just goes
[537.77s -> 543.77s]  right to the back of your head. Um, what do I? I don't want to be like the Luke Skywalker. Look,
[543.77s -> 552.07s]  I'm not going to do this. Maybe I am. Orange is kind of cool. Although I would probably have like,
[552.63s -> 558.07s]  it would probably be yellow or white. No, no, no, no, no. Of course it wouldn't.
[559.58s -> 568.84s]  I would have the darksaber. It's only one and it's mine. I would use it. I would be my blade.
[568.84s -> 590.42s]  I think I want to do purple school while you're out partying. I studied.
[592.02s -> 597.30s]  What? All right. No. OK. Well, how about we do the one that's on the shelf at every like target?
[597.30s -> 611.40s]  This one. I like it. I think I might want yellow too. All right. Medium combat style. Medium.
[611.40s -> 619.38s]  I can't. I can't change that. All right. I cannot change the combat style. I just have a medium
[619.38s -> 629.72s]  saber. Green if you're cool. No, I want the I like I want the like yellow or white or dark saber.
[629.72s -> 648.79s]  I'm ready. Let's go. Oh, here we go. Star Wars. You can't DM see a this stream because it's in a
[648.79s -> 659.75s]  video game, not a real fucking movie. You can't. I've read all kinds of threads about how this works
[659.75s -> 671.61s]  and this is allowed. Is it 10 years after the Battle of Endor, the Imperial remnant continues
[671.61s -> 676.81s]  to be driven back by the New Republic, forcing the Imperials to adopt increasingly desperate tactics
[677.61s -> 687.11s]  in the ongoing struggle. Meanwhile, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker moves to restore the Jedi to their
[687.19s -> 693.03s]  formal place as peacekeepers of the galaxy at his Jedi Academy on Yavin IV.
[695.34s -> 702.62s]  What's with the space? Jaden Kor, a promising student from Crusant, is en route to the
[702.62s -> 709.72s]  Academy after achieving the impossible, creating a lightsaber without any formal Jedi training.
[709.72s -> 725.02s]  So he's a fraud and he's being brought to the Capitol for justice and prosecution.
[725.02s -> 735.34s]  Crusant. I don't know. I couldn't read it at me. We'll be arriving at the Academy in
[735.34s -> 743.34s]  just a few minutes that Mark Hamill Mark Hamill has to be. That would be so great.
[745.21s -> 749.77s]  Wait, why is this like Harry Potter? Does this happen? Aren't you excited? We're going to be
[749.77s -> 755.37s]  Jedi learning the ways of the force building a lightsaber. Of course you already have one.
[756.09s -> 759.69s]  I'm going to get one of those stupid training sabers. I wouldn't worry about that. Wait,
[759.69s -> 764.17s]  what? I talk? I can't help it. I want to make a good impression. I'm not silent protagonist.
[764.17s -> 770.01s]  You seem really nervous. Aren't you? I mean, why would you be? You already have a lightsaber,
[770.01s -> 777.05s]  so you're probably way ahead of me. I'm Rosh, by the way. I'm not supposed to have this? Why
[777.05s -> 783.85s]  do I have this? What's your name? Jaden. So where'd you get that lightsaber? Well, it's kind of a
[783.85s -> 795.61s]  long story. I found myself on. What? That's the noise you make when you have a wedgie,
[795.61s -> 814.78s]  not the fucking plane is going down. What? We made an emergency landing several clicks west of the
[814.78s -> 820.36s]  academy. Oh, there it is. Is everyone all right? I think so. We'll send a shuttle to pick you up.
[820.36s -> 827.08s]  Can you lead the students to the nearby Masasi temple? Is that him? Affirmative Academy. We'll
[827.08s -> 844.63s]  meet you there. All right, let's go. But who is this? I'm lost on the characters. Holy shit,
[844.63s -> 854.20s]  you go fast. Jaden, we can't get to you. Make your way to the temple. All right. Jaden. Hey,
[854.20s -> 862.52s]  I'm stuck. Can you help? Hold on, Rosh. I'm on my way. Jaden, see if you can make your way around
[862.52s -> 873.88s]  there. All right, let's go. I bet you wish you had one of these, but I don't know how to use this
[873.88s -> 887.22s]  though. Okay, let's go. Should I put the thing down? Maybe you can use your lightsaber to cut
[887.22s -> 893.58s]  those trees down and make a bridge. Oh, maybe I can. Yeah, that'd be cool. Come on over here.
[895.74s -> 903.46s]  Thanks, Jaden. Let's get to the temple. All right, to the temple. Oh, watch out. We've got.
[904.26s -> 910.79s]  I don't know what I think. What? Jaden, see if you can make your way around there.
[911.27s -> 917.53s]  I'm training. I just killed the motherfucker. Maybe you can use your lightsaber to cut those
[917.53s -> 925.24s]  trees down and make a bridge. I didn't know I could kill him. Let's get to the temple.
[925.24s -> 927.96s]  Do I have a blast? Maybe I shouldn't do anything. Put this thing away.
[929.08s -> 946.54s]  Just flailing around like a kid on Christmas morning that just opened it up. Okay, cool, cool,
[946.54s -> 961.72s]  cool, cool, cool. This way. Follow me to the temple. Kill him again. I'm not gonna kill him again.
[962.60s -> 972.57s]  I can't. What's in there? Oh, checkpoint. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?
[973.37s -> 980.36s]  Yeah, I would stay the fuck away from this guy. Like, stay at least like five car lengths away
[980.36s -> 998.09s]  from me, man. I'm not going near this guy. What? Why can't I hit him? Pretty cool trick, huh?
[998.81s -> 1002.33s]  I learned that at the. Didn't go to the academy yet. We haven't even stepped in there.
[1003.13s -> 1007.94s]  Haven't done one class. I watched a few YouTube videos. What do you think?
[1012.87s -> 1018.30s]  Self-taught Jedi from YouTube tutorials. Hey, maybe you can use your saber to make another
[1018.30s -> 1044.18s]  bridge. Hey, dick. Why can you die from that? Such a shitty cadet.
[1055.02s -> 1062.42s]  All right, just let him do the work. Well, this is what happens, man. With two cadets,
[1062.42s -> 1070.31s]  we have no idea what we're doing. I just evade this lightsaber. I don't know how the hell I'm
[1070.31s -> 1082.57s]  doing with it. Kill. Shoot it. You didn't have a chance. Like, I'm not cool. I'm not with it. I'm
[1082.57s -> 1089.53s]  just a guy that bought this somehow. This was fucking like $45,000 on eBay. And I thought it
[1089.53s -> 1092.89s]  was fake, but I was like, you know what? I'm going to go for it. What if it's real? Well,
[1092.89s -> 1110.52s]  at least it turned out it was real. It's just a murderer on the loose. Hey, maybe you can use
[1110.52s -> 1118.25s]  your saber to make another bridge. Hey, did he not make it? He didn't make the jump.
[1119.82s -> 1133.32s]  I am so disappointed that he didn't make the jump. How did you not make the jump? What? He
[1133.32s -> 1143.80s]  jumped into the wall. How did you die? I don't understand. Jeremy, use quick save. What button
[1143.80s -> 1160.50s]  is it? All right, don't kill him. Shoot him. Nice teamwork, man. All right, make the jump.
[1161.48s -> 1166.04s]  Hey, maybe you can use your saber to make another bridge. Um, did he die from fall damage?
[1166.04s -> 1169.80s]  Oh, my God, I'm so mad that I missed that. He must have died from fall damage.
[1171.67s -> 1179.59s]  Let's go. Let's go. I feel like I need to keep an eye on you in case you do something stupid.
[1182.55s -> 1201.26s]  All right, move. All right, go in. Wait till he's done. Dude, holy shit, we suck.
[1207.91s -> 1212.92s]  Mark Hamill right now is like forced TV watching us. He's sitting on his couch,
[1212.92s -> 1217.48s]  which is this forced camera pointed at us. Oh, man, I've got a lot of work to do on these two.
[1225.26s -> 1229.11s]  I finally sheathed the lightsaber.
[1237.14s -> 1243.27s]  All right, I'll check it out. Um, is this supposed to be getting this hot on my hands?
[1243.99s -> 1248.52s]  I mean, I don't know. I forgot gloves. It's really hot. It's really hot to hold.
[1257.14s -> 1280.90s]  Obtain a blaster rifle. Oh, I did. Is that a Sith? Oh, my God, what happened? Quick save.
[1280.90s -> 1288.54s]  Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What's the quick save button? What's the quick save?
[1288.54s -> 1301.94s]  Somebody tell me while I'm looking. F5. It's not F5. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
[1301.94s -> 1305.78s]  come on, come on. Stop holding your head. I know it's crazy, but go. Hey, maybe you can use your
[1305.78s -> 1318.36s]  saber to make another bridge. Yes, they can't get over. We're fine. Let's go.
[1319.08s -> 1333.35s]  What is it? F12 and F9. Okay. That's fucking screenshot. Of course it is.
[1334.31s -> 1347.05s]  There's gonna be a lot of screenshots today. A lot of them. What's the point of this move?
[1347.05s -> 1355.64s]  I can't even hit them. Rebind it. Oh, yeah, I couldn't do that. I could do that.
[1356.62s -> 1366.58s]  Quick save is gonna be, um, hmm, like, I don't know, dash. And then quick, quick load is gonna be
[1367.46s -> 1381.59s]  equals. All right, we're good. All right, good. There are stormtroopers over there.
[1382.15s -> 1389.58s]  You're the one with the lightsaber. I can't skip it. Yes, again. All right, I'm going for it. Wait,
[1390.14s -> 1404.74s]  we're gonna use my force to save. Okay, then this, who, who is this guy? I'm not the lightsaber.
[1404.74s -> 1433.48s]  I'm Sith. Wait, is this a, this must be a cadet too. This is a Sith cadet. All right, kill him.
[1440.70s -> 1452.94s]  You lost to a kid. I didn't actually turn dismemberment on. I think it is. Turn on
[1452.94s -> 1464.89s]  dismemberment. It's on. It's not. Turn it on. Turn it on. It's not on. What? It can be more?
[1470.38s -> 1476.36s]  Yeah, what is actually, what you mean? What? The console command? Okay, I'll do it.
[1476.36s -> 1484.74s]  Who are you? Katarn, at your service. Welcome to a day in the life of a gym. What happened?
[1484.74s -> 1493.14s]  What did happen? Traitor. I saw a huge flash of light and ran over to find you. Just lying
[1493.14s -> 1503.18s]  unconscious. Do you recall anything? I saw three people. One was holding some sort of scepter and
[1503.18s -> 1511.45s]  it was glowing. That's all I can remember. A scepter? That sounds bad. Are you able to stand? Yeah.
[1511.45s -> 1519.05s]  Yeah, I'm okay. Peter. Stop. You always sense a disturbance in the force.
[1519.93s -> 1524.57s]  But yeah. No, he should look back and say, okay, Spider-Man. Residual dark side aura from this
[1524.57s -> 1533.08s]  temple. Absent. You'll stay here and investigate. I'd love to. Why don't you take the kids back home
[1533.08s -> 1543.14s]  now? Be careful, Kyle. You thought that was Yoshi singing? That was Luke Skywalker. It was. Singing.
[1544.02s -> 1555.50s]  Did you recover Skywalker's records? I have no idea what just happened. Yes.
[1557.02s -> 1562.78s]  With all the Jedi in the jungle, it was almost too easy. Excellent. Let's actually go over what
[1562.78s -> 1566.54s]  they're actually doing with their mouths here. I'd like to welcome all our new students to the Jedi.
[1566.54s -> 1574.78s]  It's like, you will learn to defend yourself with a lightsaber. You will also study diplomacy,
[1574.78s -> 1581.74s]  history, and more. Oh, it has been the practice of the Jedi diplomacy, history, math. However,
[1581.74s -> 1586.62s]  since there are still so few of us, we will be assigning multiple students to one master.
[1586.62s -> 1594.82s]  Ralph, you will be assigned to master home. I can't wait to begin my training.
[1594.82s -> 1599.14s]  Stop talking, dude. You're gonna get in trouble. What the? You will be assigned to master Katarn.
[1599.14s -> 1605.26s]  Jaden Kor, you'll also work with master Katarn. Now, let's begin with your first lessons. And may
[1605.26s -> 1611.61s]  the force be with you. And there was nothing, but the area around the temple felt strange.
[1611.61s -> 1620.06s]  There it is. Dark side aura was gone. Troubling. But let's look into this later. Your students are
[1620.06s -> 1628.17s]  ready to get started. Master Katarn, it's an honor to be serving under you. First of all,
[1628.17s -> 1634.33s]  just call me Kyle. The titles make my skin crawl. Okay, Mr. Kyle. You're not serving under me.
[1634.89s -> 1642.36s]  I'm gonna teach you, and you're gonna learn. That's it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
[1642.44s -> 1647.72s]  Don't worry, Rosh. You didn't. I'm offended by professionals.
[1647.72s -> 1651.98s]  This is the bad guy. Super relatable in the first 20-30 minutes of the movie.
[1652.70s -> 1659.98s]  Somebody that you start to trust. Bad guy alert. Bad guy alert. Call me Kyle. Bad guy.
[1662.57s -> 1665.29s]  This is one of the many training grounds of the academy.
[1665.29s -> 1670.33s]  What's the super dismemberment? When you're ready, Jaden, go through that door.
[1671.37s -> 1673.77s]  Wait. Oh, God. The chat's gonna be going so fast.
[1677.59s -> 1686.10s]  Here. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, main character for the past three games. He was the hero of the last
[1686.10s -> 1697.59s]  game. Oh. Oh, well. Fucking completely wrong. I don't play these games. Oh, I have to download
[1697.59s -> 1704.79s]  a dismemberment mod. I'm not doing that right now. I'll do that. I'll do that on a break.
[1705.43s -> 1711.77s]  No, you don't. No, you don't. It's a console command. Somebody just gave me like a download
[1711.77s -> 1723.80s]  link. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. We'll get G saber dismemberment one. Is that it? G saber
[1723.80s -> 1743.83s]  dismemberment one. Is that gonna work? That's the one. Three. Set it to three. I don't- I don't-
[1743.83s -> 1755.10s]  Set it to three? What the fuck? God damn it. Three? But I don't wanna do- All right. I just
[1755.10s -> 1765.40s]  typed it in. I just did it. All right. It's in. What just happened? Why did I lose the game?
[1765.40s -> 1776.76s]  It's a simple- I just did it. Okay. All right. Let's go. What are we doing?
[1777.56s -> 1778.84s]  Well, at least I'm just burning him.
[1788.01s -> 1792.41s]  Teacher, teacher. Teacher, we have a problem. Teacher, teacher, teacher. Teacher, I don't know
[1792.41s -> 1807.50s]  what happened to him. How do I get in? He turned around. He like caught me an idiot and then like
[1807.50s -> 1815.62s]  he went forward and it went through his neck. I turn around for two seconds and this is what
[1815.62s -> 1826.95s]  you two fools do. What am I supposed to do? All right. This is my training, right? Hey,
[1826.95s -> 1833.26s]  why'd you close it behind me? This course will familiarize you with your core force abilities.
[1833.26s -> 1838.86s]  These are powers that every force user has. As you progress in your training, you will learn new
[1838.86s -> 1846.30s]  abilities. Both the light and dark sides will be open to you. Remember, abilities are not inherently
[1846.30s -> 1853.34s]  good or evil. It's how you use them. Every Jedi is naturally stronger in different areas of the force
[1854.14s -> 1858.54s]  and it will be up to you to decide what to focus on. Yep, dark side. I'm gonna go fold.
[1858.54s -> 1862.54s]  I want to shoot electricity at my hands. How do we do that? Kyle, how do I shoot electricity at my
[1862.54s -> 1872.02s]  hands? These will help you lightsaber. Ready? Was that him saying that three times? Like three, two, one?
[1877.56s -> 1880.94s]  Okay, so I just did the block. He's doing it automatically.
[1892.63s -> 1908.14s]  Oh, okay. I thought I was supposed to ricochet back like Luke does in movie four. What a spoiler.
[1908.14s -> 1922.98s]  Nice work, Rush. I just run through? You did well too, Jaden. Oh, he's talking about both of us.
[1924.02s -> 1927.38s]  Even when inactive, it can diffuse a potentially volatile situation.
[1928.34s -> 1934.76s]  Trust me on that. As you train over additional fighting styles, changing styles during combat
[1934.76s -> 1940.28s]  can surprise your opponent, allowing you to gain the upper hand. Okay. From here on out, we'll talk
[1940.28s -> 1953.00s]  via comm link in each area. Let's move on. Moving up. New objective. Okay, Jaden. Use the force.
[1953.00s -> 1976.31s]  I have to do a force jump? How do I do a force jump? I don't know. He didn't tell me how to do it.
[1977.03s -> 1984.36s]  What kind of training is this? What kind of training is that? Hey, Jaden, do a force jump.
[1985.83s -> 2001.00s]  How? I don't know. Just use the force. Yeah, you just have to believe, right? Isn't that the whole
[2001.00s -> 2011.48s]  force? You have to believe that you can do it, therefore you can do it. Okay, so how do I do this?
[2012.12s -> 2023.66s]  You have to look in the game manual. All right, key binds. Movement. Hold use plus step to lean.
[2023.66s -> 2033.29s]  Okay. Run, walk, step. Force powers. Push, pull, speed, sense, absorb. Force power. Force next.
[2035.50s -> 2054.28s]  Okay. Force speed. Hold the jump button. What? This is regular jump. Force power.
[2054.28s -> 2064.54s]  All right. Push is F1. Ooh. Hey, Jaden, this should keep you busy till I finish the course.
[2065.26s -> 2079.05s]  No, he's cheating. No, he's the bad guy. Okay, got it. Oh, that's General Grievous. Force,
[2079.05s -> 2094.87s]  push. It's just Tony Hawk. Oh, dismemberment. I see it. It just is Tony Hawk underground.
[2095.67s -> 2099.03s]  God damn it. That's exactly what this is. It's just they don't have skateboards. They have
[2099.03s -> 2144.97s]  lightsabers. Okay. What do I do? Oh, what is this thing though? Force push. Nope. Force slide.
[2153.11s -> 2162.65s]  Okay. Force sense is F3. Oh, I've never pressed that button. It just makes the FOV turn off.
[2163.13s -> 2175.88s]  Turn it off right now. Oh my god, that hurt. I hated every second of that. What are these things?
[2176.44s -> 2192.65s]  Use your force sense. It's health. Oh, okay. Is force sense just a little blue circle thing?
[2192.65s -> 2207.56s]  Or do I actually have to press F3 because I hate that? F4. Oh, I hate that too. I also hate that.
[2215.38s -> 2246.41s]  What am I looking for? A way to get out. A wall? I mean, I just have to get up there, but what?
[2247.21s -> 2259.00s]  Use your force brain. Use your force brain. Okay. So what do I do about these?
[2259.00s -> 2274.97s]  Press them. Force push them. Pull them out. Get up there. Use your force brain.
[2278.49s -> 2305.02s]  I just love deal of fates. All right. Wait. This is going to be dangerous. Force jump. Force sense.
[2305.50s -> 2316.33s]  In this next area, you can use the force to speed up both physically and mentally.
[2318.63s -> 2340.52s]  Okay. Force rugs. That's what that is. Okay. F3 is force speed. What the fuck? I'm being too slow.
[2341.24s -> 2349.74s]  No, I don't have any force power left. Hold on. Where's the force energy bar?
[2360.57s -> 2369.18s]  Oh, just barely made it. It wasn't a competition. I'm sorry. I am gizing too. It's no big deal.
[2369.18s -> 2373.50s]  Hurry the fuck up. Oh, here we are. This wasn't a competition. That's a I'm a punch puncher in
[2373.50s -> 2389.42s]  the face pose. Expel him. You're expelled. Doing a great Sims impression.
[2393.59s -> 2395.83s]  He just said something to Jayden that he did not like.
[2395.91s -> 2403.26s]  Apology accepted, Rod. That's settled. It's Kyle. Yes, Matt. Uh, Kyle. Matt?
[2404.30s -> 2409.10s]  Okay. Do you almost call him Matt? He forgot his first name. Sorry about that, Matt. Oh,
[2409.10s -> 2421.78s]  yeah. Your name's not Matt. Kyle. Right. Another first name. Did some research on that strange
[2421.78s -> 2427.38s]  mark from the clothing we found at the temple. It is the symbol of Marco Ragnos, a Sith Lord
[2427.38s -> 2434.66s]  that died almost 5,000 years ago. 5,000 years. Are you serious? Do you know Jesus? Of course,
[2434.74s -> 2440.26s]  you're serious. Holy shit. Be on the lookout for information regarding a group affiliated
[2440.26s -> 2447.93s]  with Ragnos. Sure thing, Luke. Jesus was like the original Jedi. You receive countless requests
[2447.93s -> 2453.93s]  for assistance from all over the galaxy. Since we believe in at the academy, students of all
[2453.93s -> 2459.10s]  levels help with these requests. Since you're an initiate, however, Kyle will travel with you
[2459.10s -> 2465.37s]  on most of your missions in order to instruct you and ensure your safety. Okay. So wait, did
[2465.37s -> 2478.50s]  my report card? I killed six people on my first day. What? Okay, hold on. Wait, this is missions?
[2479.46s -> 2492.12s]  Cult investigation, merchant rescue, emergency assistance, droid recovery, or mercenary activity.
[2492.12s -> 2505.18s]  Cult investigation on Corellia. Okay. The city of Coronet on Corellia has had numerous reports
[2505.18s -> 2511.42s]  of activity by the disciples of Ragnos. However, it's not clear if it's really the Sith cult
[2511.42s -> 2515.82s]  or if the locals are just being paranoid about after hearing about it on the holonet.
[2516.81s -> 2523.96s]  Go to Coronet and determine the truth. I still have a few contacts in Coronet. We'll hit a few
[2523.96s -> 2528.68s]  of the local cantinas and see what crops up. We'll also follow up with some of the people
[2528.68s -> 2535.86s]  who reported this so-called cult activity. It looks like Earth. The screen allows you to
[2535.86s -> 2542.79s]  increase any one force power by a single rank. The maximum is third rank. Look on any light or dark
[2542.79s -> 2547.91s]  force power icon to upgrade. Core powers cannot be upgraded. Once a power has been upgraded,
[2547.91s -> 2553.19s]  the weapon screen will be made available. Return the upgraded power to its original rank. Click on
[2553.19s -> 2564.34s]  it again. Oh, here we go. Dark side. Force drain. Allows Jedi to transfer the life essence of a
[2564.34s -> 2574.22s]  person to themself. Okay. Force grip is the Darth Vader choke. Darth Vader choke. There it is. I
[2574.22s -> 2579.48s]  don't care. That's what I want. Lightning. Allows Jedi to hurl devastating electrical attacks out
[2579.48s -> 2587.13s]  of their hands. Jedi launches a single bolt that fires forward to do instant damage. Wait, hold on.
[2587.13s -> 2609.98s]  Yeah. You're a traitor. No. I can control it. Said every single person before him. Unlimited power.
[2609.98s -> 2614.70s]  Weapons. This screen allows you to choose two weapons and a throwable device for the upcoming
[2614.70s -> 2619.40s]  mission. A lightsaber and a blaster pistol are given to you. Choose a weapon, click on the icon
[2619.48s -> 2626.60s]  to deselect a weapon. Okay. All right. Where's just, where's black robe and bare hands?
[2631.22s -> 2639.77s]  Destructive electro magnetic pulse gun. What's this? Thermal detonator? Oh, I want a grenade.
[2639.77s -> 2648.97s]  Okay. Mines or packs? I want the grenade. Pulse rifle used against droids. Ripping apart living
[2648.97s -> 2664.22s]  material. All right, cool. And the Wookie crossbow. All right. Begin. Let's go.
[2667.45s -> 2675.75s]  Jan punches the weak way right in the holy shit. Eyes on the road. Are we crashing or is this
[2675.75s -> 2681.11s]  normal coming from that cargo trap? Wait, this is like we're going down. Oh, we're on train.
[2682.82s -> 2693.59s]  No, we're not. How you fly this plane. You can't even see. We're just sitting in front of a
[2693.59s -> 2704.47s]  computer. You take the tram. I'll take care of these ships. Okay. How do I do the, uh,
[2704.55s -> 2716.49s]  uh, okay. Weapons, force powers, lightning has, I don't know. Okay. Mouse four is going to be
[2716.49s -> 2721.69s]  lightning. Oh my God. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Good, good, good. All right. Let's go.
[2725.19s -> 2751.10s]  Open the door right now. Open the door. R2, get them to open the door. R2. All right. The other
[2751.10s -> 2755.58s]  side of this door definitely should have a video camera and just play that for the ad for the
[2755.58s -> 2765.82s]  company that made the doors. That's all you need. Is there a lever? Where's the lever?
[2770.55s -> 2776.55s]  Wait, I can't go in there. I'm trying to force pull. I can't force pull through glass.
[2790.22s -> 2804.82s]  All right. Let's, holy shit. Shock him. That's it. Get out of here. You're dealing with a Jedi
[2804.82s -> 2830.92s]  master. What? Oh, it's C3Ville. That cut his head off. Just member men. It's on. I turned it on.
[2830.92s -> 2857.91s]  It's level three. All right. Force pull. Force pull. Use your force hands. Dude, I'm trying to
[2857.91s -> 2873.72s]  interact with this. It's not speed. What's going on? Press enter. What the fuck? Enter. All right.
[2873.72s -> 2890.63s]  Nope. Sit down. Wait, I need to go back that way. Force hands. Press enter. All right. So now what?
[2893.26s -> 2917.96s]  We detached the train. Do the console command again. Hold on. Not yet. Save it. I just did.
[2917.96s -> 2929.77s]  Save. All right. We're good with this backup. Looking good. All right. Force jump. Wait. Use
[2929.77s -> 2945.37s]  this force speed. Good. Is that good? Good blaster or bad blaster? Okay. Green does not mean good
[2945.37s -> 2956.73s]  blaster health. No, I'm not a Jedi. Jedi in training. But thank you. I appreciate it. That
[2956.73s -> 2967.46s]  means I must be doing pretty well. Uh oh. Sith training. He doesn't know that I have Sith powers
[2967.46s -> 3005.72s]  too though. He's fucked. You're next. Tell me to stop. Stop. Stop. Force gun. Can I take the
[3005.72s -> 3042.04s]  lightsaber? Oops. Power up. Got it. Cut that arm off. That's a warning. That's a warning. I'm going
[3042.92s -> 3055.86s]  to give one shot to get out of here. I gave him a warning. I'm good. I'm a Jedi. I gave you a
[3055.86s -> 3067.50s]  warning. I said go home. Get out of here. It's not worth it. And he decided to charge me. I have to
[3067.50s -> 3078.50s]  do the commands in order. Hold on. What do you want me to do? Help us Obi-Wan, then G saber more
[3078.50s -> 3083.06s]  realistic, then G dismemberment three. What are you telling me to do here? What is all this bullshit?
[3087.48s -> 3119.26s]  This is gonna make the game like a joke. Not yet. I'm having fun playing Jedi Master. Oh my god.
[3119.26s -> 3125.59s]  I actually killed him. I killed him. Did I kill him? This is gonna give me at least like a
[3125.59s -> 3146.04s]  $50 an hour raise. No, no, no, no. What's quick load? Take it off. You have to do three commands
[3146.04s -> 3150.92s]  in order. All right. Well, I'm not doing them right now. Okay. I'm doing them in like 10 minutes.
[3151.88s -> 3172.18s]  Fuck. Fuck. In the head, in the head, in the head, in the head, in the head, in the head,
[3172.18s -> 3176.66s]  in the head, in the head, in the head, in the head and shoot him in the head. I'm a fucking Jedi.
[3176.66s -> 3199.90s]  They don't even use guns. How do I get up there? Jesus. You can tell I have low HP. He just knows.
[3199.90s -> 3233.37s]  That's why he ran over here. What happened to him? What? Why did he go forward? Why did he go forward?
[3235.46s -> 3258.73s]  Holy shit. Okay. How do I get up there? I'm gonna go up. Is there a force jump? Force sense.
[3264.73s -> 3275.11s]  No force sense. Force walk. Force walk to where? Force stairs. Is there a... Wait,
[3275.11s -> 3283.19s]  are there four stairs over here? Almost fucking fell. Wait. All right. I see a force. Oh boy.
[3283.19s -> 3314.94s]  Hold on. Okay. I'm gonna... What if I do speed? Oh, did you hear that? Oh my god. I landed like
[3315.66s -> 3346.34s]  roof. How do I get up here? Just fucking kill him. Obtain heavy repeater. Is there a door
[3347.96s -> 3367.59s]  inside that door? What door? Inside that door. Other door. I don't see a door. Use the force.
[3369.05s -> 3381.94s]  Yeah. Is this one open? This one doesn't open. This is a children's game. That's not... Not
[3381.94s -> 3394.57s]  everything is a children's game. I have to get up here. Go a full car back. Yeah, that's what I'm
[3394.57s -> 3421.48s]  doing. I'm gonna go up. Okay. Then we gotta go up. Up here. All right. Up. Fuck. No. In the door.
[3437.32s -> 3446.65s]  Okay. I did it. The other ones didn't. Whoa. Easy. Is there health? I need a health pack
[3446.65s -> 3468.70s]  somewhere. Force health. God damn it. I thought it was a crate that had items in it or something.
[3468.70s -> 3495.29s]  I don't know, man. What do you want to say? What? Okay. I have one health. Give me a fucking break.
[3495.93s -> 3508.22s]  Whatever. There's no health. I just have to be good. Quick save. Quick save now. God damn it,
[3508.22s -> 3514.54s]  Jeremy. Get up there. Use force heal. I don't have it. I got lightning ability first.
[3516.60s -> 3530.89s]  Okay. You guys are both in deep shit when I get in there. Believe you me. The second that this
[3530.89s -> 3536.71s]  drops, this is going right through your spine. You understand? I'll give you a little preview.
[3537.90s -> 3543.18s]  Yeah. What was that move? You have no idea. Bang. Electricity out of my hands. What, you have a gun?
[3543.18s -> 3551.61s]  A little blaster? Cute. Really nice. Cool. Sure. Can you do this? No, you can't. So give me the
[3551.61s -> 3561.48s]  fucking code to get to the main base and I'll think about letting you out because you're not locked in
[3561.48s -> 3569.32s]  here with me. I'm locked in here with you. No, no. Other way. You're fucked is what I'm saying.
[3575.29s -> 3582.22s]  That's one down. That's one down. I'm telling you. You're going to be in big trouble. Oh.
[3583.02s -> 3595.67s]  Fucked a big game on that one. Oh, that's right. I had one HP. Shit. Right. Right, right, right,
[3595.67s -> 3605.91s]  right, right, right, right, right, right. Sorry. I forgot. I forgot. I have to hide. I'm going to
[3605.91s -> 3620.04s]  hide like a gun. Wait. Okay. Hold on. I'm going to throw a grenade in there. What the fuck?
[3625.80s -> 3631.72s]  It's an explosive barrel. Of course it is. Get up. Go, go, go, go, go. Quick save it up here so
[3631.72s -> 3640.70s]  it doesn't happen to you. Quick save. Okay. Get rid of this shit. I don't want to accidentally
[3640.70s -> 3652.79s]  explode. Okay. I've cleared the room. I'm ready. Now I'm going to get rid of this shit and I'm
[3652.79s -> 3659.10s]  going to throw a grenade in there. That's that one. Quick save it right here. Okay. Where's the
[3659.10s -> 3687.82s]  grenades? How do you fucking throw these? Okay. Those things suck. Oh, is this beer? Holy shit.
[3687.82s -> 3693.08s]  This is what they were defending. Yeah. There's like the hops and the vats and stuff. This is
[3693.08s -> 3704.54s]  like a beer factory. Belt of thermal detonators. Wait. Oh, thank God. Okay. Heal. Yeah. These are
[3704.54s -> 3711.51s]  kegs and bottles and this is the shipment, man. This is the shipment right here. Quick save. I
[3711.51s -> 3735.98s]  got it. Oh my fucking glass. Of course. That was frustrating. It was glass. Now what do I go?
[3737.78s -> 3751.10s]  This way. Okay. Here we go. I'm going in here. What happened? You all right? What happened? I want
[3751.10s -> 3782.87s]  to go in here. Quick save. Here we go. Watch it. Head pack. Now that's... That's not fair. Why is
[3782.87s -> 3792.50s]  that not happening to him? All right. You know what? Just get over there. Just watch out. Dodge,
[3792.50s -> 3825.21s]  dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge. Too far. Oh my God. Ow. Oh. Oh. Shit. I'm getting too... All right.
[3825.21s -> 3848.73s]  It's the shaking camera. Fuck. Okay. I'm good. He actually hit me. You got to be shitting me.
[3849.61s -> 3890.81s]  What does this even do? Whoa. Did I dodge it? Okay. I dodged it. Got him. Okay. Save. Pile.
[3890.97s -> 3934.26s]  Oh, great. Whoa. Get out of here. Get out of here. Come here, you fucking dick. Push him off. Push
[3934.26s -> 3954.98s]  him off. Push him off. How much force juice do I have? I can't force push him. Wait. This is not
[3954.98s -> 3974.65s]  enough for him. Restart. Restart. Restart. Restart. Restart. Use a quick force grenade.
[3974.73s -> 3986.14s]  Hold on. I'm busy. Holy shit. Okay. I'm ready. Here's what we're gonna do. Detonation packs.
[3986.78s -> 3998.44s]  We're gonna play this so fucking cowardly. I don't even care. Okay. How do I blow them up?
[4004.15s -> 4025.64s]  They are. Come out here and find out. Right click. Jesus. That wasn't even the right guy.
[4025.64s -> 4036.44s]  That wasn't even the Jedi. Oh, shit. No. That was the wrong guy. Oh, come on. All right. Whatever.
[4038.25s -> 4059.13s]  Get out here. My lightsaber grenades will take you down. He's dead. I think he's dead.
[4067.45s -> 4070.89s]  All right. This time I'm not gonna screw this up. Oh, my fucking god. Get me in here.
[4071.85s -> 4075.85s]  This time I'm not gonna just have the one dude come out with a blaster and have me blow him to
[4075.85s -> 4086.55s]  hell. All right. Here we go. Ready? Come on. Whatever. Give me a regular blaster.
[4089.27s -> 4121.21s]  Okay. I'm ready. Oh, shit. What? It didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I didn't do
[4121.21s -> 4138.36s]  anything. What happened? That's right click, isn't it? It's right click, isn't it? You guys
[4138.36s -> 4146.62s]  said right click. Is it proximity? Are you throwing on purpose? No. I thought it was
[4147.42s -> 4152.95s]  detonations. The lightning zapped the bomb. I didn't do anything. I didn't press anything.
[4153.51s -> 4162.14s]  The lightning hit it. Wait. Oh, lightning. You mean like environmental lightning. Are you kidding
[4162.14s -> 4183.66s]  me? I didn't press any button. Oh, would you die already? Okay. Save this shit right here.
[4184.38s -> 4207.58s]  Here we go. All right. Come get me. Yeah. Nice taunt. Good luck. Come on over here.
[4208.22s -> 4226.38s]  Why? I'm just killing this motherfucker right now. He blocked it. He blocked it.
[4239.35s -> 4254.57s]  Big mistake. Oh my god. He slit my throat. Get the fuck over here. Come on. Come here.
[4262.26s -> 4263.30s]  Just walk down this.
[4294.15s -> 4310.49s]  Knock him off. Knock him off. Just knock him off. Knock him off. Knock him off.
[4313.96s -> 4350.66s]  Got him. All right. Got him. What happened? What happened? It was the bomb. Yeah. I didn't touch it.
[4351.30s -> 4356.38s]  Wait. Should I press all the buttons? These buttons? That's a bomb. I have to. Okay. Hold on.
[4356.94s -> 4372.22s]  Hold on a second. Let me. What is this doing? Disarm the bomb. Did I get it? Disarm the bomb?
[4372.70s -> 4381.53s]  That wasn't so bad. Okay. Mission accomplished. Is it? Let's just pull the top up.
[4382.41s -> 4386.74s]  The tram is speeding up. I think they're going to ram it into the station.
[4386.74s -> 4404.97s]  You have to get to the control room and stop that train. What? Bye. Nice. They're going to ram it
[4404.97s -> 4418.81s]  into the station. I got to get down there right now. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Force speed. Force
[4418.81s -> 4435.51s]  speed. Go. What the fuck is this person? I thought he was going to go right.
[4436.71s -> 4458.15s]  Force push. That's an execute. Okay. Why does he always throw? What do you mean always throw?
[4458.15s -> 4462.07s]  A guy literally just jumped cartwheeled into frame with a lightsaber on and I had a little
[4462.07s -> 4479.90s]  bit of a panic. I got hit by a building. Oh my God. You motherfucker. I can't believe you just
[4479.90s -> 4512.41s]  headshot me. What the fuck? It's running. Turn and face me, coward. All right. That guy can
[4512.41s -> 4529.50s]  instantly kill me. Oh my God. Somebody told me this mission was hard. Well, I'm doing pretty
[4529.50s -> 4547.96s]  good. I think it's on easy. No, it's not. It's on medium. I always get shit for playing on like
[4549.40s -> 4580.33s]  whatever. Oh my fucking Jesus. How many times do I get? I don't have any health.
[4623.70s -> 4670.89s]  Die already. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's hit him in the head. Okay.
[4670.89s -> 4712.07s]  All right. Here we go. Is he jumping over this? Go ahead. Do a dodge again. Dodge it again.
[4712.07s -> 4720.57s]  Careful. It's on your right side. Be careful. Careful. Ooh, that was a good one too. Careful
[4720.57s -> 4766.36s]  though. Yeah. What's going on with my eyes? What? What do you mean deserves? No. Oh, come on. No way.
[4770.07s -> 4772.95s]  No way. I have to something. I have to get like lightning to strike or something.
[4773.67s -> 4784.07s]  Come on. Lightning strike. Get me back into this. Come on. A lightning strike will probably fix it.
[4784.07s -> 4813.88s]  I need to restart the game. Okay. All right. I'm going to restart. Restart the game. Try restarting.
[4813.88s -> 4832.98s]  And all right. I'll turn on the alternative dismemberment shit after this mission. After
[4832.98s -> 4847.91s]  this mission. I will. I promise you guys see. Okay. Let's try it again. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
[4847.91s -> 4858.01s]  Whoa. Whoa. Okay. We're good. We're good. We're good. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. All right.
[4858.01s -> 4878.92s]  All right. All right. I'm going to fuck this guy up. Come on down. Charge the sniper. How do I charge
[4878.92s -> 4901.58s]  sniper? I can just air shot him. I can't dodge everything, man. Okay. Now let's go up and hold
[4901.58s -> 4933.74s]  fire. Does that work? Just get over here. Get over here. Watch out. This guy's got blasters right
[4933.74s -> 4947.42s]  there. I got it. Did I win? Oh, okay. It's slow mode. That was weird. Come the fuck on, dude.
[4948.14s -> 4998.33s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. How do you fucking miss? My god. Worst Jedi ever.
[4999.13s -> 5018.73s]  Get the fuck out of here. All right. My goodness. Can I get to the end? I made it. Thank god. I did it.
[5036.86s -> 5037.34s]  Rage.
[5046.87s -> 5054.76s]  Force you. I'm fucking begging you. All right. I will. I will. Darth Vader. It's definitely Darth
[5054.76s -> 5071.62s]  Vader. How about mercenary activity? A number of reports that the disciples of Ragnos have been
[5071.62s -> 5076.26s]  trying to hire mercenaries and smugglers to haul some cargo. If we can contact one of these
[5076.26s -> 5081.77s]  mercenary groups, we can find out the cult's base of operations. One of the smuggling rings that we
[5081.77s -> 5086.41s]  know about is based in Morse Isley. Go there and see what you can find out. This one sounds like
[5086.41s -> 5091.53s]  it could be nasty, so I'll be going with you. You'll find some of the galaxy's worst low lives
[5091.53s -> 5098.58s]  on Tatooine. My parents are from Tatooine, and I spent like 15 to 20 years there. Grown up.
[5101.69s -> 5115.02s]  Thanks, though. All right. Force heal. Jedi have the ability to heal themselves after injury.
[5115.02s -> 5124.10s]  Thank god. Okay. Jedi heal. What about weapons? I want to pick a different lightsaber.
[5124.66s -> 5131.35s]  I'll try the electromagnetic blaster, and I'll just take the regular blaster.
[5132.25s -> 5139.90s]  Level three lightning is amazing, though. Most force powers are totally useless until level three.
[5139.90s -> 5149.26s]  Oh. All right. Dismember. All right, I'm gonna do the- after this cutscene. Hold on,
[5149.26s -> 5171.58s]  we're gonna get ambushed. Relax. Do we know them? Kyle does.
[5177.11s -> 5181.11s]  Stay here and guard the entrance to the docking bay. If anyone tries to enter or
[5181.11s -> 5185.75s]  leave, detain them. I'll head over to the crate canteen and ask around. Don't let anybody leave.
[5185.75s -> 5194.90s]  Don't let anybody get in. You can- I won't let you down. Nobody leaves. Nobody gets in.
[5209.75s -> 5217.03s]  Oh, hi. A Jedi? Me? No, not yet. I'm one of Kyle Katarn's students. He's talking to some locals.
[5217.91s -> 5225.51s]  What'd he- I need to kill you. Don't let anybody out. Don't let anybody in. I have to kill him.
[5225.51s -> 5235.74s]  He has to die. I'm abandoning my post. I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[5254.38s -> 5297.77s]  I don't think he can kill Chewbacca. Wait! What? I'm so sad about it, too. I can't believe what
[5297.77s -> 5306.49s]  just happened. All right, Chewie. All right, Chewie! Chewie! What are you thinking, man?
[5307.62s -> 5316.15s]  Get in there. Smoke. Dismemberment. All right, fine. I'll do it. What is it? A console command?
[5317.66s -> 5322.50s]  Quick save. And give me the- give me the- give me it. This better be worth it. And you better
[5322.50s -> 5328.68s]  not ruin my game or else I'm gonna be very upset with you. All right, do I have to put in the-
[5329.40s -> 5343.13s]  do I have to put in the quotation marks? Oh, no. Okay, no quotation marks. Hold on. I have to-
[5343.13s -> 5357.46s]  every time I alt-tab, I have to fucking- give me a sec. Hold on. Okay. Help us Obi-Wan Kenobi 1.
[5360.06s -> 5373.02s]  I can remove this shit later, right? I better be able to. I'm gonna be very upset if I can't.
[5374.22s -> 5390.01s]  Okay. Help us Obi-Wan Kenobi 1, then Saber Realistic in this order- in the correct way.
[5390.01s -> 5395.88s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Help us Jerma 1, then more ass dump truck 3. Stop.
[5398.90s -> 5414.01s]  G Saber More Realistic 3. Okay. It's one space at- like, G Saber More Realistic space 3, right?
[5414.01s -> 5423.35s]  G Saber More Realistic is right protected. I- I can't do it. I have to, like, do it in the actual,
[5423.35s -> 5439.27s]  like, INI file. So, I'm sorry. Didn't do the first one right. Yes, I did. Help us Obi- Help us Obi-Wan.
[5441.13s -> 5452.82s]  I did that already. Help us Obi-space 1. And then Saber More Realistic. I have to run this
[5452.82s -> 5463.02s]  as an admin. Just do dismemberment 5. Let him- yeah, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. You need the
[5463.02s -> 5477.14s]  quotation marks. I'm done. I'm just playing the game. I'm done. Wait, how come- you guys haven't
[5477.14s -> 5490.92s]  seen any of this? Oh, uh, I probably should have, like- oh yeah, oops. Sorry. I'm done.
[5490.92s -> 5512.65s]  Worst gamer moment. I can't use the console. Yes, I can. I'm done. G dismember- G underscore
[5512.65s -> 5527.27s]  dismemberment 5. It needs to be quotes? I need quotes. He didn't put the quotes in. What the
[5527.27s -> 5543.46s]  fuck, dude? Help us Obi-Wan. That doesn't matter. That is stupid. You need mods for it. All right.
[5543.46s -> 5549.48s]  Yeah, well, you guys don't have any idea what's going on. You guys don't have any idea what's
[5549.48s -> 5568.04s]  going on. Oh, Chattis, no idea what's going on. You have to go to the config files. Yeah, well,
[5568.04s -> 5573.64s]  I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna play the game. I'm not gonna turn the game off, do the config,
[5573.64s -> 5576.84s]  test it. Did it work? It didn't work. I have to go back into the console. It didn't work.
[5576.84s -> 5588.42s]  Whoopsie daisy. You gotta go fucking do this and then fucking do that. You have to defrag the
[5588.42s -> 5610.36s]  hard drive. So much false shit. How do I get out of here? Chewie, where do we go? Turn on the sex
[5610.36s -> 5625.16s]  scenes. Where are we supposed to even go? I wasn't paying attention. I was too busy trying to, like,
[5625.16s -> 5630.44s]  turn on, like, big head mode and, like, they're in go-karts and their heads fly off when you hit
[5630.44s -> 5654.28s]  them once. Watch out, Chewie. I'll do my best Han Solo, Chewie, for you guys. I'll do it as much
[5654.28s -> 5678.20s]  as I can. I'm gonna try really hard. There needs to be a scenario where I say it, though. I don't
[5678.20s -> 5691.02s]  know why I thought for one second I thought that was him talking. Chewie! That was bad.
[5692.06s -> 5696.46s]  It was supposed to be... I didn't expect him to shoot yet.
[5696.46s -> 5705.32s]  Oh! Chewie, Chewie, Chewie, Chewie, don't go out there. Chewie, that's a bad idea.
[5706.50s -> 5713.40s]  But I'm gonna snipe this person from, like, a hundred miles away. Whoops. Whoops. I don't
[5713.40s -> 5731.85s]  have it anymore. Where's it? Oh, come on. Nice. Took his leg off. Look at that dismemberment.
[5781.69s -> 5813.86s]  Chewie! Doctor him! Get him, Chewie! What happened? Oh my god, conserve your health,
[5813.86s -> 5821.72s]  please. Oh, shit. Chewie, that was a weird way to... What? Why did Chewie just go like...
[5822.44s -> 5839.02s]  I don't know how Chewie talks. What's force heal? Okay, controls. Drink rage. Okay, force heal.
[5839.74s -> 5852.07s]  Oh my god, that's so useful. I'm just gonna do it again. Like, I don't care.
[5857.48s -> 5860.76s]  Razor death adder, mouse five. Yeah, don't buy this thing.
[5864.04s -> 5890.23s]  Chewie! Did you... What the hell happened? Watch out, Chewie! Whatever the grade! Okay, I'm sorry.
[5894.14s -> 5916.68s]  To voice Andy. Chewie! Chewie! Chewie! Nice backflip. What do we do? Chewie, what are we
[5916.68s -> 5928.57s]  supposed to do? New offer. What do you got? Let me see it. Limited time offer. Four dollars off the
[5928.57s -> 5934.41s]  debt if you go and do all this shit in the autoexe folder. No. Honestly, I don't even care if that
[5934.41s -> 5947.74s]  was like fucking a billion. I wouldn't do it. I don't even care. Four million off the debt. No,
[5947.74s -> 5962.20s]  that's not enough. He hates us. All right, force press the buttons. Was there nothing actually in
[5962.20s -> 6001.90s]  here? In the middle of that, I just saw somebody write, good. That's an evil droid. It was walking
[6001.90s -> 6007.34s]  around and it had a gun all the way deep into his head and it was gonna come out and just go
[6007.34s -> 6014.20s]  go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go. How do I know? Because I had the intel. I know
[6014.20s -> 6025.88s]  the exact model number and the exact fucking serial code. What? Why am I looking at the cameras?
[6026.52s -> 6055.75s]  Where the hell are we supposed to go? We have to go like up there? Put on the droid zoom.
[6055.75s -> 6064.30s]  Just jump up here? I don't think Chewie can do this. Chewie's not a Jedi. It's kind of annoying
[6064.30s -> 6068.14s]  that they didn't... They should have eventually. I don't know why they didn't give Chewie a lightsaber
[6068.14s -> 6074.12s]  eventually. Or like a lightsaber gun. Like he shoots out like beams. Like lightsaber beams with
[6074.12s -> 6094.18s]  like the crystals. He deserved it. These computers? I don't... What am I supposed to do? They invented
[6094.18s -> 6110.25s]  a real lightsaber by the way. Um all right well I'm sure it works. Definitely doesn't. All right,
[6110.25s -> 6117.62s]  where the hell am I going here? Wrong way. Fuck. Chewie, why can't I just like say go? You go.
[6118.18s -> 6126.52s]  It does. Yeah it's one of... I'm sure it does. I'm sure it works behind a bunch of like military glass
[6127.40s -> 6140.52s]  and a high-powered robot holds it and slashes through something. Dude, you suck at games.
[6140.52s -> 6157.24s]  I didn't tell you. I'm... Look, I'm trying to find the way. Portable. There it is. Found it. Did I?
[6157.24s -> 6190.78s]  Yeah, lucky. Do it. Look out Chewie! There's a guy behind that corner! There's quite a few of them
[6190.78s -> 6205.34s]  actually. Why we just let them do this? Can you hold them Chewie? I don't know if that's a yes
[6205.34s -> 6214.98s]  or a no. That sounded like a no. That sounded like a no. That was like a... I don't know. Okay,
[6214.98s -> 6249.16s]  you're gone. Chewie in the next rumble. Guaranteed. Use the gun for a little bit. Guns are fun in this
[6249.16s -> 6265.35s]  game. Pretty cool. I don't hate them. You get to hear that cool Star Wars crunch. All right, what
[6265.35s -> 6291.11s]  we got? I have to shoot them. Doesn't work? Of course it does. What's that? I heard something.
[6300.20s -> 6302.79s]  All right, keep going.
[6307.30s -> 6313.94s]  All right, it's a guy that throws grenades. Cool. How do you not do that to yourself?
[6314.66s -> 6319.53s]  So this is just a guy... Okay, he's fucking crazy. Get out. Get out of the room.
[6321.24s -> 6363.11s]  Get out of the room. He's crazy. He's not that stupid, is he? What? Heal. Thank you for the
[6363.11s -> 6393.77s]  reminder. Enemy. Oh, watch out. C-3PO. Get out of the way. R2. Get out of the way, R2. Oh, sorry,
[6393.77s -> 6429.19s]  R2. Is it 33? I'm gonna leave him alone. But I'm gonna shock him once just to...
[6430.95s -> 6435.18s]  I'm gonna just give him supercharged powers. Now he's ultimately charged.
[6435.90s -> 6438.54s]  That worked. That's the different on droids. It gives him battery power, guys.
[6450.78s -> 6461.30s]  You just ruined Star Wars. Are you sure? Are you sure I did? And it wasn't that mouse
[6462.02s -> 6467.38s]  that just wears pants? Like just wears red shorts and that's it? Are you sure?
[6468.10s -> 6497.24s]  Elevator? Yes, we sure are. I heard Ravenclaw. I have one headphone in. Somebody tell me what
[6497.24s -> 6530.28s]  happened. Oh, shit. Squish him in the elevator. Squish him in the elevator. Get in the elevator
[6530.28s -> 6567.18s]  with him. Got it. Got it. Got it. That's a side slash. All right. Now what? In here. Two more,
[6567.18s -> 6596.97s]  right? Kubaka, get over here. Is he coming to me? Give me another fight right here.
[6598.81s -> 6646.47s]  No? Oh, no. Down. Okay. Get out of here. Yeah, I knew you. I had to find him. We just go out.
[6646.47s -> 6667.67s]  All right. Where's Han Solo? Han. Get this thing started. We gotta move, Han. Put this thing into
[6667.67s -> 6696.14s]  hyperdrive. We gotta get out of here, Han. Fight speed ahead. There he is. No, that's not. That's
[6696.14s -> 6706.42s]  Kyle. What the fuck? It was so much room to not have to do that. You could just walk around him.
[6715.78s -> 6723.56s]  He's snapping my neck. What's going on? I thought he was just gonna spin and snap my neck.
[6739.61s -> 6766.84s]  Thanks, Chewie. I got praise from Chewie. Leg attacks. I only jumped 14 times this entire level.
[6766.84s -> 6786.28s]  I used lightning more than I jumped. R2? Isn't it R number two? R2? R2.
[6790.30s -> 6795.26s]  How's your training going? I've been sent on a few errands. Nothing exciting. Same here. I guess
[6795.26s -> 6801.29s]  that's just how the training works. I thought it was just me. Ever wonder if your master is holding
[6801.29s -> 6806.57s]  you back? You know, making sure you don't become too powerful. Oh, evil? Why would you say that?
[6806.57s -> 6811.69s]  Evil? Kyle doesn't seem to really foster my talents. I've gone on a couple of missions with
[6811.69s -> 6816.73s]  him, but he doesn't let me do any of the really important stuff. Maybe he's observing you, you
[6816.73s -> 6821.53s]  know, seeing how you accomplish your missions. I wouldn't worry about it. I'm not so sure.
[6822.41s -> 6827.69s]  What do you think, Jaden? Well, I- Ready to get back out there? I learned electricity faster than
[6827.69s -> 6833.91s]  you did. So if you want to be the evil one, you gotta get in line. No, not at all. I'm ready.
[6833.91s -> 6846.36s]  Let's go. All right, we got droid recovery, emergency assistance, merchant rescue, merchant
[6846.36s -> 6853.05s]  rescue. What's this one? Academy has received a distress call from a merchant ship that crashed
[6853.05s -> 6858.25s]  on the planet Blengeel. It was pulled out of hyperspace when they crossed paths with an
[6858.25s -> 6865.24s]  inter- an interdictor cruiser. The Imperials, apparently not wanting their presence known,
[6865.24s -> 6870.78s]  fired on the merchant ship. The merchants managed to make it to the planet surface and call for
[6870.78s -> 6877.72s]  help. As far as we know, the planet is uninhabited. This should be an easy assignment. I think you
[6877.72s -> 6882.58s]  can handle it while Kyle is away with Rosh. Take a shuttle, land at the coordinates of the distress
[6882.58s -> 6888.97s]  beacon, and pick up any survivors. Sure thing. All right, we got lightsaber. Oh, hold on. I gotta
[6888.97s -> 6895.85s]  look at these. Jedi can absorb dark force power, force push, and force pull directed at them. Okay.
[6895.85s -> 6909.70s]  Better heal. Mind try- allows Jedi to confuse or misdirect attention. This is just like a defense.
[6909.70s -> 6917.03s]  Force jump. Allows Jedi to make a tremendous vertical leap. Okay. Jedi can jump three times
[6917.03s -> 6921.96s]  their normal height. Pull certain levels and objects and targeting. Can also pull an enemy.
[6921.96s -> 6931.10s]  So this just makes it stronger. Use it to get out of a force grip or drain. Jedi can sense people
[6931.10s -> 6942.54s]  in invisible markers at short range. Okay. 33% faster than normal speed. Lightsaber defense can
[6942.54s -> 6948.22s]  deflect projectiles and melee attacks in a small arc directly in front of them. Who cares? It has
[6948.22s -> 6952.38s]  to break saber locks and parries against other Jedis. Who cares? I'll just go right for the throat.
[6952.38s -> 6967.40s]  And a lightsaber flies straight from the player. Okay. Force drain, extra lightning. I think Jedi
[6967.40s -> 6981.06s]  can maintain the force lightning for a sustained forward attack. I want the sniper rifle. And this
[6981.06s -> 6991.77s]  thing is pretty cool. And I'll take the detonators. Here we go. Remember, this is the best mission in
[6991.77s -> 7009.51s]  the whole game. Okay. Well, I'll take your word for it. Again, we get shot down again. Any of these
[7009.51s -> 7018.74s]  easy just to like ride a bike to these places. Just land on the planet away from everything and
[7018.74s -> 7027.77s]  ride a bike. Why fly over everything? Just get one of those- Why do I have to fly over the base?
[7028.41s -> 7038.01s]  Hey, you there. Found the force. You've come. This place is-
[7040.06s -> 7050.44s]  Oh, watch out. We've got worms. Oh, that guy's gone. What was that? They introduced that guy
[7050.44s -> 7056.20s]  last seen just to get him killed by a worm. Okay. They even had- Did that guy have a name?
[7057.32s -> 7083.98s]  Maybe a merchant ship. I'm not going down there. I can wait this out. That hurt me. He's right behind
[7083.98s -> 7093.94s]  me, isn't he? Yeah, he was. Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, look at you. Power up. Can I just upgrade that?
[7093.94s -> 7112.07s]  What the fuck? Oh, God. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
[7114.44s -> 7127.82s]  Get up. Should be safe here. All right. Jedi. Jedi, take a look. All right. There's something
[7127.82s -> 7137.77s]  in there. I used my Jedi. Take a look to see what was over there. I need a thermal detonator. Hold
[7137.77s -> 7147.18s]  on. All right. But how do I get up there? Over here? All right. Jedi, take a look. I got it.
[7147.18s -> 7163.08s]  What do I do with this? Force pull. Force push. Destroy it. Shock it. Oh, what? Okay. Power
[7163.08s -> 7193.11s]  converter. Now, what do I take this? I'm going to go over there? Oh, geez. All right. I got one.
[7194.18s -> 7200.70s]  New objective. Okay. Point. Now, I got to go get the other one. Where's the other one?
[7201.34s -> 7213.64s]  I got to go all the way down there. Okay. I'm going. Ow. Use the force. I'm not going to...
[7213.64s -> 7216.52s]  All right. You know what? I'm just going to say that word so people just think that I messed up
[7216.52s -> 7228.26s]  and said it accidentally. No, I'm not. Why would I? What? Get up. Where's this next part? Right
[7228.26s -> 7242.52s]  there. Right here. Ready? Hey. Hey. Oh. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch
[7242.52s -> 7253.56s]  out. Watch out. Watch out. Just give it to me. I'm not safe here. Just get the other one. I'm
[7253.56s -> 7265.67s]  right here. Oh, shit. What? I can't hold more than one. Oh, fuck. I got to move now.
[7272.14s -> 7305.08s]  Why is it so scary? That's not even... What? Oh, you shitting me. Okay. All right. Go.
[7305.72s -> 7321.11s]  Where is it? Over here? I can see you motherfucker. I can see you. I'm safe right here.
[7321.75s -> 7324.70s]  All right. Get it? We're going to go right back.
[7324.70s -> 7350.62s]  Scary. It's very scary. Very scary. All right. I'm almost... Wait. Where are they? Oh, fuck. Go.
[7350.62s -> 7377.50s]  Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Okay. Two. Put it in. What? I don't have it? Oh, man. There's more than...
[7378.06s -> 7386.49s]  Okay. This is going to suck. Absolute ass. Where's the next one? All the way down there.
[7387.29s -> 7401.30s]  All right. Just go. Go for it. Okay. This is it right here. Where are they?
[7409.58s -> 7429.32s]  Okay. I can go... We're going to go back. Backwards. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. He's
[7429.32s -> 7440.79s]  right behind me. He's right behind me. Oh, my God. I hate that sound. I'm safe right here.
[7445.51s -> 7459.38s]  Just say it for 500 million off the debt. No. It's not worth it. Yes, it is. Okay. One more.
[7463.05s -> 7473.13s]  Last one is all the way... I don't know. Where is it? Where's the last one? Oh, shit. It's so far
[7473.13s -> 7488.98s]  away. What the... Jedi Speed. That's the key is to use the Jedi Speed. I haven't been using it.
[7489.78s -> 7511.98s]  I can just run with Jedi Speed on. Don't get cocky. What's that? Shit. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[7511.98s -> 7516.81s]  Stop. Stop. All right. I need to recharge my fucking force.
[7550.23s -> 7568.81s]  Okay. I'm fine. It was Morty Muriel. Oh, Rick. All right. I got all four of these.
[7568.81s -> 7583.38s]  Yeah. This part sucks. Oh, fuck. Don't be stupid here. Wait. Go. Go. Hurry.
[7589.96s -> 7598.63s]  Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Oh, shit. Oh. Did I save it? No. Idiot. You idiot. Why would
[7598.63s -> 7629.42s]  you not... What an idiot. I have... Why... Save it. Quick save. It's one button press. All right. Hold
[7629.42s -> 7639.14s]  on. Use force kin. There you go. Are you happy? Is everybody here happy now?
[7653.29s -> 7657.35s]  I don't want to be in the ground. I don't want to be in the ground. I don't want to be in the
[7657.35s -> 7664.34s]  ground. There we go. Okay. I'm all right. No deal. I don't even care about the deal. I just
[7664.34s -> 7703.46s]  want people to stop writing it. Oh, no. Don't... Holy shit. How did I not get eaten? I got it. Done.
[7703.94s -> 7714.36s]  Whatcha doing? Off this crazy rock. I get off this crazy rock. That was it? Sounds like those sand
[7714.36s -> 7722.66s]  birds. Holy shit. Nasty critters. Back safe and sound. We'll let Coruscant know to mark it as
[7722.66s -> 7729.83s]  hazardous. This is getting more serious. We have been receiving numerous reports of a Sith cult
[7729.83s -> 7741.82s]  called the Disciples of Ragnos appearing all over the galaxy. Okay. Emergency assistance or droid
[7741.82s -> 7750.79s]  recovery.
[7781.53s -> 7782.81s]  All right. Lightning three.
[7788.02s -> 7802.63s]  Anything in front of them. Sounds good to me. I want it. This is a droid level so we're gonna
[7802.63s -> 7811.37s]  have to go with droid specific items. Okay. Blue milk?
[7826.95s -> 7828.63s]  Moisture farmers?
[7828.63s -> 7833.35s]  Cult. All right. Don't worry. Jawas are pretty friendly.
[7833.35s -> 7838.62s]  Are they? Every time I've seen a Jawa on in the Star Wars, aren't they like just taking apart
[7838.62s -> 7854.95s]  robots and like attacking people? You're a fake fan. Am I? Oh, we gotta fight. We gotta fight.
[7855.75s -> 7886.01s]  We gotta fight. Jawas versus... Dude, shoot him. Okay. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't... Oh,
[7886.01s -> 7910.98s]  he just saw that. Don't tell anybody about that. Do it. Oh, now I understand what they mean when
[7910.98s -> 7922.70s]  you just have so much power. You just can't help it. You have unlimited power. The dark side is
[7922.70s -> 7937.29s]  just too strong. I got electricity in my hands. People can fly in. Holy shit. This feels very,
[7937.29s -> 7958.58s]  very good. That... I'm... Oh my god, dude. Sniper! Hey, okay. Oh my fucking...
[7959.54s -> 7967.24s]  It doesn't work that way. I just look angry. What the fuck is happening? Oh, this people.
[7968.20s -> 7983.14s]  I was like, why am I getting hit when I fire the gun? All right. Jedi mind heal.
[8005.86s -> 8008.34s]  Oh, that's a perfect room to just go in there and just go...
[8016.46s -> 8019.10s]  Ah, that move is unbelievable. This move is incredible.
[8020.54s -> 8031.58s]  I'm unstoppable. No one has any chance to beat me. No one. Even the emperor. He can't do this shit.
[8031.58s -> 8035.74s]  They should be concerned about me now because I have actually unlimited power with my lightning.
[8036.46s -> 8044.44s]  I went all into the lightning. I didn't even train a lightsaber move. I went right for that
[8044.44s -> 8048.92s]  book in Harry Potter right in the back of that room. I just opened it up. I didn't care about
[8048.92s -> 8055.98s]  a wand. I don't even have a wand yet. I don't give a shit. Oh, the wand chooses the witch. I
[8055.98s -> 8061.46s]  don't care. I don't fucking even want a wand. Don't even give me one. Just give me that book
[8061.46s -> 8081.42s]  in the back that has like the magic fucked up shit in it. He's mad with power.
[8085.80s -> 8090.81s]  No, they'd have to make a new house for me. I'd be so strong. You know what I mean? Oh,
[8090.81s -> 8112.26s]  you're Gryffindor. Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Jeremy. I sit alone at lunch. I can't even do anything.
[8112.74s -> 8136.74s]  Oh my god. You're slaughtering them. I am just... Look. Look. I'm unbeatable. And I'm going to try
[8136.74s -> 8144.22s]  to... I'm going to save the galaxy. I just... You find me somebody. You find me the bad guy
[8144.22s -> 8158.15s]  and just point me at him. You are the bad guy. It's me. You find me the bad guy. Go ahead. Point
[8158.15s -> 8163.27s]  to him and you say, ah, Jeremy, you should die. That's the bad guy. Well, I have to examine that
[8163.27s -> 8169.82s]  first and go over what you mean. What did they do? They are trying to rule the galaxy. They're
[8169.82s -> 8174.87s]  trying to take over the world and use a Death Star. Okay. All right. Okay. How big is the Death
[8174.87s -> 8191.48s]  Star? It's as big as an entire planet. All right. I can handle that. Well, I'm not looking for him,
[8191.48s -> 8205.66s]  so... Well, now someone's going to be looking for that droid. The guy who owns this house is
[8205.66s -> 8231.78s]  going to come out and be like, what the fuck happened to G3PO? Where? Yeah. Okay. In the face,
[8231.78s -> 8248.73s]  immediately dead. In an instant. Instant one headshot. All you have to do... I would just have
[8248.73s -> 8254.28s]  to come in here and hold my hands up. Like out. Forward. I wouldn't have to do any electricity.
[8255.08s -> 8261.67s]  I wouldn't have to even hurt anybody. And people would just be like, okay, get out of his way.
[8262.39s -> 8264.79s]  Get the fuck out of this guy's way. We know what he does. We know who he is.
[8265.59s -> 8279.06s]  That's fine. That's Jeremy from House Jeremy. Everybody... Just everybody leave. Just leave.
[8279.06s -> 8297.35s]  Everyone leave. What does he want? That's great. See? I chose the side of good. I chose the side
[8297.35s -> 8305.10s]  of good. I keep hearing... Somewhere in my ear. Deeply into my brain. Somewhere. I just keep
[8305.10s -> 8308.70s]  hearing, do it. I don't know who it is. I don't know what they're talking about. I don't know
[8309.10s -> 8322.70s]  what they want me to do. But they're in my head. Maybe just a little. Is that what you wanted me to
[8322.70s -> 8343.30s]  do? Do that? Do this? Gentlemen? Good to see you, gentlemen. Do it. No, not that one. He's turning
[8343.30s -> 8353.14s]  to the dark side. No, I'm not. I can control it. I really wish I had more control to launch them
[8353.22s -> 8363.21s]  up over the... Okay, now you... That's all. Just get behind him. Just distract him.
[8364.62s -> 8367.66s]  Just distract him long enough for somebody to come and just butt him in the head with a rifle.
[8369.70s -> 8377.54s]  Most powerful being in the universe still has like a soft head. So, you know, I guess that's true.
[8378.10s -> 8418.04s]  How do I get up there? No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Come back.
[8419.86s -> 8422.82s]  Oh, man. When I get up there, I'm going to electrocute whoever's up there. I don't even care.
[8425.80s -> 8465.58s]  Oh, let's go. What happened? Oh, no, he's here. I feel like, I feel like they're all running
[8465.58s -> 8482.30s]  around going, oh, no, it's, it's Lu Bu. Lu Bu is here. Oh, shit. Everybody get the fuck out of the
[8482.30s -> 8510.20s]  way. You didn't see that? He doesn't know. Okay, apparently not. Oh, man. Okay, the party's over.
[8510.20s -> 8520.78s]  Party's over. Party's over. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to use a lightsaber.
[8528.89s -> 8548.52s]  What am I doing? All right, let me heal. I'm gonna get the full health. I probably should do heal
[8548.52s -> 8558.50s]  too, right? That just will make it much quicker. All right, that's good. Good enough. Good enough.
[8558.50s -> 8571.61s]  That's good. Good, good, good, good. Okay. Can I put the lightsaber just away? Is there a sheath?
[8571.61s -> 8591.32s]  I don't even want to use it. Let's press one. Okay, lightsaber just kind of gets in the way.
[8591.96s -> 8612.97s]  I'll get out of here. All right, what's this open? Think fast. Think fast.
[8627.72s -> 8646.15s]  I almost made it. How do I get down there? How do I do that? Oh, my goodness. What should I do?
[8646.15s -> 8670.18s]  What do I do? I don't know. Speed. Speed. Oh, you guys all right? I need to save them.
[8670.82s -> 8702.76s]  All right, let's go. I did it. I saved you. You are free to go. Look, you can move.
[8702.76s -> 8709.26s]  I want you to move. I ain't saying it again. The hands come up. Both hands come out forward.
[8709.26s -> 8741.06s]  I ain't saying it again. Let's go. I'm trying to rescue mission here. Instantly dead. Okay, that's
[8741.06s -> 8755.56s]  whatever. No lightsaber. What are you doing? Wasting energy. Is it on timer? I think I've...
[8755.56s -> 8764.02s]  Oh, my God. He shot me right in the head. Just... Hey, German. Here's a can of whoop-ass.
[8766.97s -> 8785.98s]  Really? Can of whoop-ass. He's stone cold. Actually, German, lightsabers recycle power.
[8785.98s -> 8795.93s]  I'm good. And that hurt a lot, but I'm good. All right. What's this link spam? What are you
[8795.93s -> 8802.02s]  guys doing? What's going on here? German95 debt relief album cover art. German has made
[8802.66s -> 8806.98s]  song after song throughout his YouTube and streaming career, whether it be the rat birthday
[8806.98s -> 8811.46s]  mixtape, the giant enemy spider, or the banana bro's anthem. He's made musical masterpieces,
[8811.46s -> 8819.21s]  but none of these musical masterpieces have been collected in an album. Hopefully after this deal,
[8819.21s -> 8823.37s]  that can change. Here below, you can see the price negotiations. We hope you accept Mr.
[8823.37s -> 8830.23s]  Albertson. Okay. 100 million for covers of a song, 200 million for extended versions of the songs,
[8830.23s -> 8835.21s]  300 million for completely new songs, and 1 billion for an official raid song. Okay.
[8835.21s -> 8843.91s]  Beat boxes are acceptable. Let me think about this and take the first break of the evening.
[8843.99s -> 9037.37s]  I'll be right back. And we're back. Maybe we'll vote on this, maybe, eventually. I'm interested
[9037.37s -> 9050.71s]  in the deal, but I'm not saying yes to it yet. Hold on. I'm currently being brunt. Come back.
[9054.04s -> 9065.88s]  Catboy. Yep. Put on the ears. Look at all this catboy. Catboy, catboy, catboy, this catboy,
[9066.20s -> 9081.86s]  catboy, this catboy. What did that do? Oh, I turned it off. You can go. Go, go, go. You're good.
[9081.86s -> 9093.10s]  Go through. Go through. Hands up. I'm not going to. All right. I just hit him with like the
[9093.10s -> 9109.38s]  peripheral. Whatever. Don't go that way. That's where fire is. What did I just do? Oh, okay.
[9109.94s -> 9124.65s]  Elevator. Where's slug germa? Where's slug germa? Oh shit. Somebody was still alive.
[9125.61s -> 9145.45s]  Is there a lightning four? Can you do lightning four? I just killed like 10 people. I don't know
[9145.45s -> 9170.42s]  who's over there. Just guessed. All right. Got him. Lightning 10 is a nuke. Is it? You're okay.
[9171.14s -> 9175.22s]  You must be the droid we were sent for, but it doesn't look like there's any jawas left to
[9175.22s -> 9182.10s]  negotiate with. Well, I guess you better just follow me. Follow me. All right. Let's go.
[9182.82s -> 9197.43s]  Don't go out there. Wait, wait, wait. It's not safe. It's not safe. It's not safe out there.
[9198.31s -> 9211.22s]  It's not. Now it is. All right. Let's go. Do I even need to be at the academy anymore? I was
[9211.22s -> 9216.18s]  starting to get worried. Any problems? Not unless you count the sand people I ran into.
[9216.90s -> 9233.78s]  Well, you're still in one piece. This guy with training is not. This is terrifying. Wait, what?
[9233.78s -> 9270.07s]  82 people killed? Wait, what do you mean next mission? Next mission? I couldn't. What do you
[9270.07s -> 9278.81s]  mean go back to the academy? I only got one more. Officers from the planet Bakura have requested
[9278.81s -> 9283.21s]  our assistance. An unknown party is taking control of a power station up in the mountains.
[9283.21s -> 9288.06s]  They sent a team to investigate, but they haven't reported in. Their concerns are twofold. They want
[9288.06s -> 9292.06s]  to stop whoever has taken over the station, and more importantly, ensure that the station
[9292.06s -> 9297.93s]  itself remains undamaged. The station is built over a dormant volcano. And if the facilities
[9297.93s -> 9302.90s]  destroy the volcano, it could destroy a heavily populated city. The Bakurans need someone to
[9302.90s -> 9310.71s]  infiltrate the facility and thwart the group's plan. Oh, you can skip one mission per set of five.
[9312.47s -> 9329.59s]  Should I even do this then? Yes. Okay. All right. So I have lightning. Now I can do force choke.
[9329.59s -> 9339.86s]  Force grip, drain, lightning. I can't do any more points in the lightning. Force grip.
[9344.09s -> 9368.98s]  I think the weapons don't really matter. Okay. Mission five. Oh, how long is this game?
[9372.41s -> 9389.42s]  I'm just bored? It's pretty long. It's 50 hours. What the hell are you talking about? Okay. Force
[9389.42s -> 9417.10s]  powers. We got heal, lightning, grip. That was three. Like 10 hours? Oh, okay. So Kyle's in
[9417.10s -> 9435.19s]  trouble then. Kyle, where is this guy? Man. This is where I get into a little bit of trouble because
[9435.19s -> 9439.24s]  I get bored, right? I go into the side room and there's like a bunch of potions in there,
[9439.24s -> 9446.25s]  and I pick one up and I drop it. Stuck in here.
[9475.58s -> 9494.82s]  Should I go stop him? Oh, all right. We got to stop the count. What? I'm under arrest? Oh, hi guys.
[9510.76s -> 9529.64s]  I was testing my new move out and it sucks. I don't have to do anything, man. I'm unbeatable.
[9530.68s -> 9538.04s]  No one can stop me, even if there's a boss. Who the fuck were you guys? Did you guys spawn
[9538.04s -> 9558.12s]  in? Press all the buttons. Just press every button on the machine. Who cares? Uh-oh. Hold on.
[9558.12s -> 9563.56s]  I got to take care of this. The one thing that can stop me is environmental death.
[9574.39s -> 9599.11s]  Good. Nice. Got it. Watch out for the gas. Easy way to deal with this.
[9599.83s -> 9615.02s]  Oops. How did I jump over that? What? I got the security key. Nice. Okay. I'm too powerful.
[9615.58s -> 9629.69s]  I became too powerful. Way too powerful. Way too quickly. Oh, it's the bomb. Okay. Wait. Easy.
[9629.69s -> 9634.82s]  Easy. Bomb. What's the difficulty? I don't think that's going to do anything.
[9637.27s -> 9654.42s]  Four more to go. Now you need an apprentice. I don't think that works. I can't have an apprentice.
[9655.14s -> 9667.56s]  I can't teach somebody how to do this. I'm the only one that can. Should I go back up?
[9671.91s -> 9680.09s]  Um, okay. Well, I'm just going back up. What did I come down here for?
[9681.42s -> 9684.46s]  Jump in the pit for a funny laugh. Okay. That would be really funny, actually.
[9685.58s -> 9715.48s]  God damn it, man. Bring it. Let's go. Bring it down. Why do you just want me to cry?
[9718.39s -> 9740.65s]  Cry? Oh, cuff me. Cuff me. What was that move? Shit your pants. Shit your pants. All right. So,
[9740.65s -> 9760.52s]  I got to go this way. Okay. We'll go over here now. Wait, what? What did I miss?
[9764.90s -> 9778.89s]  This is not the Jedi way. I have the security key. Right. Well, I... Oh, why is it all the way down
[9778.89s -> 9797.30s]  here? That's a horrible place for that. No lightsaber. What's the lightsaber for, man?
[9798.02s -> 9805.53s]  I don't even need it. Who cares? I don't need a lightsaber. Uh-oh. Somebody else with exploding
[9805.53s -> 9812.70s]  hands up there, I think. I'm not scared. I'm not concerned about that. Like, you have good power.
[9812.70s -> 9842.84s]  You have a power, too. It's for your cosplay. That's right. Too powerful. Too powerful. Fine.
[9842.84s -> 9852.90s]  I guess I'll use it for a minute or two. What's another cool move to get? All right. Be careful.
[9852.90s -> 9856.02s]  Don't be an idiot. I don't want to, like, accidentally blow this up. So, we're going to
[9856.02s -> 9864.18s]  go from here and go that way. See? I'm careful. Look at how careful I was being. Three more. Three
[9864.18s -> 9879.59s]  more. This level sucks, to be honest with you. Is this why you guys told me to do this? Everybody's
[9879.59s -> 9894.02s]  like, do this one. Do this one. Next. Next. Because, you know, this one was bad. Where's this taking
[9894.02s -> 9909.58s]  me? You're going to get lost? Oh, I found a secret. What does that mean? Oh, I have the Jedi mind
[9909.58s -> 9922.82s]  look. I'll find it eventually. I'm going to stop flirting. Whoa! I almost just got crushed. Sorry.
[9922.82s -> 9930.78s]  Stop flirting with chat and play the game. What do you think? I am. All right. This one back here.
[9930.86s -> 9943.05s]  This is the one I already got. What was the next one? We're going to go, I guess, over here.
[9943.85s -> 9956.55s]  I don't even know who... I didn't even know you were there. You weren't even on my radar.
[9957.11s -> 9975.38s]  I don't think I can do this one. I can't go from here. Shit. Okay. Well, whatever. Coward. Coward.
[9975.38s -> 9983.51s]  Coward. Coward. Force the wall run. Can I get in here with it? I need a key card or something?
[9985.50s -> 9997.34s]  Well, this is dumb. Can you fart for us? No. Thanks. Is that one up there done, or does that
[9997.34s -> 10027.18s]  one need to be done? I need to do that one. I think I can make this elevator and then go up and
[10027.18s -> 10036.71s]  disarm it. Fart now. Fart now. I'm not... Why do you want me to do that? You guys are gross. Please do
[10036.71s -> 10050.30s]  it. Two more. Where are they? Is that one done? I can't tell. Let's get the sniper rifle out.
[10051.58s -> 10058.68s]  That one's done. This one's done. That one's done. All right. All three over here are done.
[10059.86s -> 10065.08s]  Now we go this way. Back over here. All right. Where are the other ones? I only see...
[10065.80s -> 10077.70s]  Holy fuck. I thought I fell off. Do a force fart. I don't think I want to do that. A force fart is
[10077.70s -> 10093.78s]  just shit your pants. I'm not... No. You don't force. That's what happens. That's a force fart,
[10093.78s -> 10140.87s]  and I'm not doing that. Worst noise. No, it wasn't. It was fine. Force puke. No. Force puke in
[10140.87s -> 10153.66s]  mother's bed. Oh my god. All right. So how can I get in here? This level sucks. This level sucks.
[10154.22s -> 10175.35s]  Level sucks. This level sucks. This level sucks. I didn't do this one. No. I did. Where are the
[10175.35s -> 10195.05s]  other ones? What the fuck? I went in a circle. Yeah. Well, where am I supposed to go? What's the
[10195.05s -> 10200.17s]  command to just complete a level? This one's... I don't like this one. I don't want to do this one.
[10202.63s -> 10216.58s]  Force just fall off. Soft lock. You're almost done? Yeah, but I can't... How am I supposed to
[10216.58s -> 10234.42s]  get out? I don't know where to go. Can I get in there? Look up the guide. Go back through the door.
[10235.38s -> 10243.14s]  All right. I'm through the door. And then I can go down this way or I can go back through here.
[10244.10s -> 10267.27s]  Back through. Force pretending. No, this brings me down. Force pretending. Forcing a joke. Force
[10267.27s -> 10296.89s]  joke. Save it here. Now I can go this way or down. I'm going to try it this way. Down. Okay. Force
[10296.89s -> 10315.98s]  look. One up there I got. This one over here which I didn't get. I remember this part. Can't get in
[10315.98s -> 10332.86s]  this door. I got that one. I haven't been down there though. Hold on. Kirby air ride waiting room.
[10338.57s -> 10373.16s]  I'm not playing that game. Here? In here? In here? What is this thing? Key on corpse.
[10373.88s -> 10390.12s]  Key? Where is it? Where is it? This guy? Give me a fucking break. Don't blow it up. I was trying to
[10390.12s -> 10400.73s]  shoot him. Okay. That opens. Where's that door? It's over here somewhere. I saw it. I ran by it.
[10400.73s -> 10425.14s]  Where is it? Where's that door? It's a red door. I can't. I couldn't. There it is. Goodbye. You just
[10425.14s -> 10438.25s]  got electrocuted. Oh no. I'm too good at the game now. And even with a high difficulty it wouldn't
[10438.25s -> 10449.66s]  even change anything. I can't wait to fight a boss. And just kill the boss instantly. Off a cliff.
[10463.86s -> 10486.98s]  Got him. Bomb right there. Now that was fucking cool. Alright. That was really cool. One more.
[10487.06s -> 10501.00s]  Only one more. Where is the last one? One final one remains and then I can get the
[10501.00s -> 10534.01s]  heck out of here. Please. Alright. No? I'm gonna cross this way. Don't go down. Go across.
[10539.66s -> 10549.18s]  There it is. There it is. I win. I win. I win. That does it. Better get back to my ship.
[10549.74s -> 10565.05s]  Where's the ship? This guy doesn't even do anything.
[10565.05s -> 10582.02s]  Where's the ship? Okay. I think it's this way. I feel like I'm hacking.
[10582.66s -> 10596.31s]  I put in cheat codes to make the game impossible to lose. You bad? Nope. You're good.
[10617.08s -> 10630.66s]  I didn't kill the droid. It just went. It was one little blaster. He's gonna be fine.
[10631.46s -> 10644.71s]  Where the hell did I just go? Oh. Come on. No. Get. Level sucks. Level sucks. Level sucks. Level
[10644.71s -> 10708.54s]  sucks. Now where the hell do I go? Back this way, right? Move. Move. Move. Bye bye. There's my ship.
[10715.10s -> 10727.72s]  Force change your difficulty. Stronger than the emperor. By far. He couldn't do this.
[10741.43s -> 10759.30s]  Mm-hmm. Uh-oh. Alright. Let's go. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. He's getting concerned?
[10763.64s -> 10772.90s]  Jayden, I was looking at how many people you've killed. It's over 50 per mission. Maybe put a
[10772.90s -> 10777.13s]  couple points into jump. Maybe into heal.
[10777.69s -> 10786.71s]  Relay some disturbing news. Someone sliced into my personal records and accessed some highly
[10786.71s -> 10791.91s]  sensitive data about places where I felt a strong connection to the force. Places like Cloud City,
[10791.91s -> 10798.15s]  Hoth, and Biss. What could they get from that besides a tour? Something nasty. I believe that
[10798.15s -> 10803.67s]  the sceptre Jayden saw was somehow used to drain the residual force power from the Masasi Temple.
[10803.67s -> 10810.39s]  Drain the force? How can anyone do that? I'm not sure. But I learned from the Jedi Holocron
[10810.39s -> 10815.99s]  that devices were created in the past that could absorb and store force energy. Those people Jayden
[10815.99s -> 10821.11s]  saw may have discovered some way to harvest force power with that sceptre. Which could be dangerous
[10821.11s -> 10828.71s]  indeed. So what are we going to do? We'll have to investigate any locations from my records.
[10828.71s -> 10833.99s]  That includes all of you students. This guy. You're going to wail. Mad eyes. Pissed off eyes.
[10834.07s -> 10841.80s]  The valley of the Jedi. It's real action. Who would they be stealing force power?
[10841.80s -> 10846.82s]  Sorry too much Jayden. I bet that these cult guys can't take on a Jedi.
[10846.82s -> 10852.94s]  Well we're not Jedi yet. We're just students. You may be just students.
[10852.94s -> 10859.98s]  We're junior heroes. So don't rush it. Jayden I'm sending you to Hoth where I had a vision of Obi-Wan
[10859.98s -> 10865.21s]  Kenobi. Imagine there was a pretty strong aura there. Rosh I'm sending you to the remains of
[10865.21s -> 10870.97s]  the planet Byss. It's very remote so I doubt the cult has been there. Don't stay too long.
[10870.97s -> 10876.34s]  The imperial remnant may still be operating in the area. No problem. That's everyone then.
[10876.34s -> 10892.41s]  May the force be with all of you. And also with you. Call me if you need any help. Let's go.
[10894.97s -> 10903.67s]  Investigate the site of Luke's vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Rosh I never heard that is. It's me. That's
[10903.67s -> 10926.14s]  not how he talks but whatever. All right I got my electrical amplification device.
[10928.89s -> 10934.79s]  Or a giant calculator. I'm not sure which one it is. Or the farting part of a cash register.
[10941.22s -> 10955.99s]  Am I giving this the finger? Whatever it is. What is that?
[10965.51s -> 10969.67s]  Come here. Come here. I want to get on one of you. Come here.
[10970.63s -> 10986.10s]  Get over here. Get over here. I'm just gonna follow the beacons.
[11001.90s -> 11026.55s]  Wait what about my friend? I can't just leave him hanging. I can. You want to go?
[11027.51s -> 11054.04s]  I don't think you know who you're fucking with here. Do it. You dead? Now you're a little scared.
[11054.04s -> 11066.31s]  I am the most impossible to destroy being in the universe. You want to taunt? Goodbye. He survived.
[11066.31s -> 11079.18s]  He's the chosen one. That's me. I just have to use it for a little bit because it's kind of like a
[11079.18s -> 11084.33s]  car. Like you got to use your car's battery for it to work otherwise if you don't use it it just
[11084.33s -> 11110.65s]  fucking not turn on. So it's gonna use it for a little bit. We're going the right way. I think
[11110.65s -> 11115.61s]  it's a whole I think that guy's whole body came off. Come here. I need to I want to get on you.
[11122.42s -> 11131.82s]  Somebody there. Someone there. Oh shit an AT-ST. This is the ultimate test of the ultimate power.
[11142.97s -> 11172.65s]  Oh shit that's a bad place to save. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Stay back. Hey you're not
[11172.65s -> 11209.10s]  supposed to be over here. Horse hide. Whatever. Saver. Lightsaber. It's my friend. I'm coming.
[11211.74s -> 11238.28s]  I can't open it from this side. Stuck in here? Let's go. No one is safe.
[11239.16s -> 11264.47s]  No one. Not when I show up. No one is safe. What did that do? Secret. Oh a secret area. Cool.
[11265.11s -> 11286.23s]  Grenades. Food. Health. What did that button press do? I don't know. I'm not sure.
[11286.87s -> 11301.45s]  He just summoned Boba Fett. He did? Oh no. How do I fight him? How am I ever going to beat him?
[11301.45s -> 11333.56s]  What door today is open? Down? How will I ever beat Boba Fett? He's going to show up and he's
[11333.56s -> 11376.34s]  going to have a rocket launcher. It's going to be impossible. Massacre. The little toaster bot.
[11376.42s -> 11385.27s]  Wait. I have to kill the toaster. All right. You get to live. You get to live. You get to live.
[11386.15s -> 11403.50s]  Not yet. What the fuck do you think you're going to do? The boss is not going to have
[11403.50s -> 11411.78s]  any time to even do his monologue. Right now the boss has seized the cameras here and he's just like
[11411.78s -> 11417.22s]  oh shit. Shuffling papers. My fucking speech. Hold on. I wasn't ready for this.
[11418.82s -> 11424.26s]  How dare you enter my domain without asking and without express permission in my restaurant.
[11425.14s -> 11446.15s]  I'm scared. I didn't have time to memorize my lines. Oh cool. Oh nice. I don't even need to use it.
[11448.57s -> 11469.43s]  Who needs the super cannon? I cannot be stopped. Follow the beacons.
[11473.70s -> 11492.86s]  This guy's just running through. This is fucking terrifying. Beacon. Follow the beacons. I'm just
[11492.86s -> 11510.81s]  playing battlefront 2 and I get to randomly get to be one of the heroes. I'm having lots of fun.
[11511.53s -> 11523.69s]  Oh did they get in? I don't know man. Maybe there's a secret entrance somewhere. I'll use my force
[11523.69s -> 11566.57s]  look. I don't see anything. You guys see something? I don't see anything. Maybe around the back? What
[11566.57s -> 11575.30s]  do you guys think? In the comments of this video you tell me what you think I should look. I'm
[11575.30s -> 11605.00s]  thinking maybe up top. What do you think? I don't know what to do. We get 5k likes. They literally
[11605.00s -> 11614.84s]  told you to get in the AT-AT. They did? I'm sorry I was too busy killing everything and having no
[11614.84s -> 11648.57s]  contest. Where's the AT-AT? Get in there. What do you think? I'm trying to find one. There it is.
[11649.21s -> 11688.81s]  Get in this? I can't get in it. It's shooting at you? Hey! Getting sniped. Yeah whatever.
[11688.81s -> 11709.69s]  All right I'm safe right here. Relax. Recharge. Heal. Recharge. Heal. 500 million off the dead
[11709.69s -> 11730.97s]  if you stop using the lightning. You may as well stop playing the game. Something exploded behind
[11730.97s -> 11737.86s]  us. I have no idea what it was. All right I gotta get in here. Do I get in? Oh shit. All right. All
[11737.86s -> 11750.49s]  right. All right. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Get in. When I get in there you're
[11750.49s -> 11804.62s]  gonna get electrocuted dude. Why can I not just get in here? Shoot. I tried. I tried. I tried to do
[11804.62s -> 11839.26s]  it like five times. I had to do it in first person apparently. All right now what? What's the difficulty
[11839.26s -> 11845.94s]  if I like watching winners not losers? It's on normal difficulty just because I picked the really
[11845.94s -> 11855.10s]  strong dark side move. I can't play the dark side character. It's the most powerful in the universe
[11855.10s -> 11891.64s]  but you are a bad guy. This is a lesson to all of you. All right what's the new objective? That's
[11891.64s -> 11911.90s]  kind of fun. Right in the head. They were just heating up by the space heater. I kind of feel bad
[11911.90s -> 11919.99s]  about that one but I mean this is the this is the empire. This is the evil empire. What? So the evil
[11919.99s -> 11929.48s]  empire can't be destroyed by another evil empire? What are you trying to say? Look I I might be evil
[11929.48s -> 11933.72s]  but they're evil too. It's evil versus evil right now. You don't have there there's no somebody
[11933.72s -> 11945.91s]  nobody would rather win. It's just bad guy versus bad guy. There is no good guy right now. You press
[11945.91s -> 11979.26s]  M. Discover what the imperials are doing in echo base. I'm not gonna do it. Don't worry. I don't
[11979.26s -> 12000.79s]  even need a health pack. I have free health. Hi guys. Oh you lived. Look at you. You lived. Not for
[12000.79s -> 12014.86s]  long. What's next? How you doing? Research? Cool. I'm not you get to live because you remind me of
[12014.86s -> 12021.86s]  an old pepsi bottle. You're an old like crystal pepsi. You get to live. Or do you because crystal
[12021.86s -> 12057.06s]  pepsi was fucking gross. Can I just go up here? Pure evil. Unlimited power. Unlimited power but
[12057.06s -> 12062.42s]  still can't figure out how to fucking leave a base. Sense of direction. Awful. Don't matter.
[12063.38s -> 12076.14s]  IQ. Horrible. Doesn't matter. None of that matters. All that matters is power. Power.
[12076.14s -> 12084.84s]  But he's he's he's an idiot. You think that matters? Look what's happening. What matters right now?
[12086.01s -> 12103.42s]  Power. Total power. And then we hide. We hide because I don't have any power left.
[12103.90s -> 12120.38s]  Oh it's starting to affect me a little. I think too much electricity is starting to affect me. My
[12120.38s -> 12126.70s]  hair is standing on end. This guy would be running through the halls with this huge static electricity
[12126.70s -> 12138.41s]  here. Burnt like ears. His clothes he'd have like burnt singed ends of all of his t-shirts and shit.
[12139.37s -> 12152.07s]  Yeah like Marv and Home Alone. Just imagine Marv and Home Alone running around with a cloak on.
[12152.63s -> 12161.24s]  Oh too many computers in here. I can't do this.
[12211.05s -> 12216.76s]  What? I didn't even save the game. I didn't think I was ever going to need to.
[12217.48s -> 12241.67s]  He just cut me in half. I was on low battery. Crazed electrocutor. Oh shit. Made the same mistake.
[12241.67s -> 12254.12s]  I went the wrong way. How? No I didn't. Get back down here. Choke him. Get over here. I can't be.
[12254.12s -> 12315.54s]  Like that was embarrassing. Crystal Pepsi. Stop. Hey. Stop. Stop. Stop. You can't fight me.
[12316.10s -> 12337.48s]  You can't stop me. You can't stop the Jedi's. I'm not even a Jedi. Here we go. Wait. Bad entrance.
[12352.78s -> 12385.27s]  You know I wish there was just a punch. Okay here we go. Oh my god. He's trying to like block them
[12385.27s -> 12406.86s]  and just leave. What happened? How did he do that? Don't even matter. I'm killing this guy in one
[12406.86s -> 12424.07s]  head. One earbud Andy. Don't matter. Unlimited power. Go ahead. One, two, three. I gotta get out
[12424.07s -> 12427.86s]  of the way. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. Man you gotta
[12427.86s -> 12430.82s]  get out of the way. He's way more powerful than me and if he's way more powerful than me then we
[12430.82s -> 12479.90s]  both gotta fucking run man. We are. Fuck. Are you this? This isn't good. I better find this Elora.
[12480.94s -> 12511.19s]  Get dunked on. I win. Get out of the way fucking abominable snowman. Yes master. Dagobah.
[12511.75s -> 12516.47s]  Skywalker didn't mention it in his journals. He must have been trying to protect something.
[12517.35s -> 12529.22s]  Uh oh. It's the apprentice. Not lightning wielding. I don't even use that thing.
[12534.42s -> 12546.20s]  I'm also 30. All right you want to go motherfucker? Oh nice job. You're dealing
[12546.20s -> 12569.72s]  with a lightning user. Ow. Eat that power. Oh shit you're doing evil laugh or yeah I'm kind of evil
[12569.72s -> 12579.26s]  too. I could I'll pull it. I'm the fucking evil one. You're not evil. I don't want I don't want
[12579.26s -> 12583.34s]  that. What if you have any hand? I don't want it. No stop giving it to me. I don't want it. I don't
[12583.34s -> 12594.15s]  want what you have. What do you I I don't what do you want? Hey let's talk. You and I should probably
[12595.62s -> 12600.90s]  I'm evil too. All right I'm the fucking evil one of the story. I'm looking on the lightsaber
[12600.90s -> 12617.86s]  shit all over me. No no you're weak. You piece of shit. Look what do you want anyways? What do you
[12617.86s -> 12627.45s]  want with all you with the empire? Like how about this? You're strong. I'm strong. I know I'm way
[12627.45s -> 12631.93s]  stronger than you but make could be one of let's just you play dice and see who can win this.
[12631.93s -> 12648.73s]  Maybe we should team up or something. Yeah and I I've won every fight I've ever fought. How about
[12648.73s -> 12660.49s]  you? How many fights have you won? That's how you win every fight. I'm gonna get in the dumpster.
[12662.36s -> 12670.36s]  Will you come in the dumpster with me? Get in here. This is where we're gonna have our
[12670.36s -> 12680.12s]  this is we're gonna have our our meeting. Get in the meeting. I want to get in here. Get in the
[12680.12s -> 12688.28s]  dumpster. We're having a dumpster evil dumpster meeting. Please humor me. Thank you. Okay so
[12688.92s -> 12694.98s]  first thing. Well now biggest fucking debate in the book. Now you're stuck in there.
[12695.78s -> 12711.38s]  Now you gotta listen to me. Yeah. Oh extra bounce on that one.
[12727.83s -> 12740.31s]  Oh shit it's a wall. What happened? Oh no.
[12748.02s -> 12754.55s]  Everybody just relax. I'm pretending to be dead. This wasn't going anywhere. Just everybody relax.
[12755.19s -> 12757.99s]  When she leaves I'm gonna get up and we can just go to the fridge and get a snack and shit.
[12759.27s -> 12776.31s]  Should I hold my breath? I think she'll be able to see my chest moving. I have to cough so
[12776.31s -> 12782.98s]  bad. I'm gonna sneeze. Fuck I'm gonna sneeze and she's gonna execute me. She's gonna fucking
[12782.98s -> 12806.86s]  execute me. Where is this? This is a bad save. Wait where the fuck is this? Where is this? Way to go.
[12810.86s -> 12818.06s]  Way to go Darth Ron. Holy shit this is a horrible save. Why do I have it so far back here?
[12831.88s -> 12849.03s]  Low checkpoint. He's swinging at me. That was stupid. That was really dumb.
[12849.03s -> 12866.66s]  I sneeze. I'm not allowed to sneeze. Remember this part. Look out. Oh I didn't mean to um
[12867.91s -> 12881.70s]  am I up? What the hell just happened? Can you? Can I get you to follow me down here? What if I bring
[12881.70s -> 12898.78s]  a giant like abominable snowman friend? Oh my oh my god you made it in. Oh my god you made it in.
[12899.94s -> 12913.21s]  Oh my god you made it in. Come on come on come on. You don't fit. Okay what if I put a grenade
[12913.21s -> 12938.63s]  behind him? Whatever. Here we go. Yep yep yep yep yep yep yep. I know. I don't know how to use one
[12938.63s -> 12969.29s]  of these things. Nice block. I have an idea. This is just crazy enough to work. I'm gonna get her
[12969.29s -> 12975.51s]  shit stuck in a wall and I'm gonna unload a machine gun into her face. So throw that at me,
[12975.51s -> 13018.52s]  get it stuck in a wall. Do I actually kill her? It's gotta be the dumpster. We'll meet again.
[13022.41s -> 13026.86s]  Two eight-year-olds. I can't wait.
[13044.01s -> 13046.41s]  Sprint sprint sprint sprint sprint. Push him in the back as hard as I can out the window.
[13046.41s -> 13048.89s]  You must have already taken the force energy from there.
[13048.89s -> 13052.84s]  Just as others have reported. Coruscant? Everywhere.
[13052.84s -> 13058.01s]  Biss.
[13058.01s -> 13062.09s]  Rosh hasn't returned. He's long overdue and we haven't heard from him.
[13063.08s -> 13069.08s]  Link link link. I sense he's still alive. I'm going to Biss to look for him.
[13070.12s -> 13080.73s]  Hold on I can't. I'll see what I can find out. Very well. What about me? Rosh is my friend.
[13080.73s -> 13085.45s]  You can help by staying here and completing your training. Kyle's right. There are still
[13085.45s -> 13089.45s]  missions for you to undertake and we can't neglect the training of one of our most promising
[13089.45s -> 13096.20s]  students. Promising? Yes. Due to your heroics on Hoth, we are promoting you to apprentice.
[13098.62s -> 13105.96s]  Thank you master Skywalker. Master-
[13105.96s -> 13112.14s]  New style, fast style. It's a short and quick style.
[13112.86s -> 13116.42s]  Master Skywalker and Master Katarn have left the academy.
[13116.42s -> 13119.40s]  They've been instructed to provide you with a set of possible missions.
[13120.04s -> 13126.22s]  Rescue, meet contact, covert operation, capture the crime lord, or investigate.
[13126.22s -> 13128.95s]  Now let me take a look at this link.
[13133.19s -> 13138.87s]  No more reload Randy. Time for Sith Andy. A truly powerful Sith lord never dies. To prove your power,
[13138.87s -> 13142.33s]  10 million will be added to the debt each time you reload a quicksave.
[13142.33s -> 13155.11s]  But what do I get? I get nothing.
[13160.54s -> 13162.78s]  No more reload Randy. Time for Sith Andy.
[13164.26s -> 13165.78s]  My Sith lord never dies.
[13168.76s -> 13172.79s]  No deal. This is just bad for me.
[13173.35s -> 13183.16s]  That fucking Harry Potter outfit with the lightsaber. Like what the fuck.
[13186.86s -> 13192.17s]  School recess. All mushed into one guy in front of the green screen.
[13192.81s -> 13205.51s]  No deal. Which one of these is fun? Which one- from those of you that have played this,
[13205.51s -> 13208.47s]  which is a good one? Capture the crime lord.
[13210.18s -> 13215.70s]  Covert operation. I will do crime lord first.
[13216.42s -> 13220.49s]  We've received anonymous information that a large number of assassin droids have flooded
[13220.49s -> 13224.26s]  the black market recently. These droids have been banned for a number of years,
[13224.26s -> 13226.50s]  and no public companies produce them.
[13227.86s -> 13233.64s]  Lenek Rakdo, a small-time crime lord on Crusant, is suspected to be manufacturing these droids.
[13233.64s -> 13237.32s]  Capture Rakdo so that maybe we can get- we can interrogate him.
[13237.32s -> 13243.42s]  We should be able to handle this no problem. Thugs like Rakdo are intimidated by the sight
[13243.42s -> 13250.30s]  of a lightsaber.
[13250.30s -> 13264.17s]  Okay. Force choke. Need to get Hewl.
[13267.51s -> 13276.30s]  Did you think you could just barge in here and take me into custody, Jedi?
[13276.94s -> 13282.84s]  That's gonna cost him a lot of money to fix.
[13283.64s -> 13290.10s]  I feel like this is- by the way, you could have just like hid behind a dresser or something.
[13290.74s -> 13311.50s]  He just hears that while closing the door. He's just like, what just happened out there?
[13311.50s -> 13316.62s]  Alright, so just get in the X-Wing, fly, park on the roof of this building.
[13316.62s -> 13320.25s]  I have an X-Wing. This should not be a problem for me.
[13320.89s -> 13344.04s]  Just fly and land somewhere else. I don't want to even- don't add- don't- I didn't agree to that.
[13344.04s -> 13347.83s]  I didn't agree to that. You did not- I did not agree to that.
[13348.31s -> 13355.64s]  Where am I supposed to go? Too bad. No, that's not fair.
[13358.57s -> 13361.61s]  Gain access to the office building. Alright, well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
[13374.44s -> 13380.86s]  This sucks.
[13399.32s -> 13402.20s]  Alright, make the jump in. Three, two, one, jump.
[13404.26s -> 13412.68s]  Jump. I have a question for all you Star Wars fanatics.
[13414.34s -> 13420.76s]  Is lightning- is the- is lightning just absolute dark side?
[13421.32s -> 13425.48s]  If you learn how to shoot lightning out of your hands, you're bad.
[13429.53s -> 13434.58s]  No, so when who cares? Good guys can do it too. So why don't good guys do it all the time?
[13444.09s -> 13449.38s]  Because it's evil. Kit Fisto used a lot of force lightning.
[13449.38s -> 13459.53s]  Yeah, so what's the problem then? It's emotion.
[13464.23s -> 13467.58s]  For me? For me, that's right.
[13468.14s -> 13473.29s]  They were just announcing that they were the target practice.
[13473.29s -> 13491.37s]  Oh, can I get a new lightsaber style? Yeah, this is it. I'm using it right now.
[13491.37s -> 13505.10s]  What are some of the dark side moves? What actually quantifies the dark side?
[13505.82s -> 13507.98s]  You've got the lightning, you've got the choke you.
[13510.55s -> 13516.23s]  Choking and lightning. Force gas lighting.
[13518.10s -> 13524.26s]  Holy shit, good aim. Force drain.
[13524.82s -> 13554.87s]  Oh my- where the fuck did you come from? Force push.
[13554.87s -> 13558.71s]  No, that's a good- that's a good guy move. I see Anakin does that all the time.
[13559.59s -> 13578.18s]  Obi-Wan does that all the time. Real drain.
[13578.74s -> 13594.33s]  Oh, you're still alive? You know, just kill that fucking guy, seriously.
[13595.05s -> 13614.17s]  All right, from here, there's this guy right here. Drop that shield.
[13614.17s -> 13629.37s]  All right, dead. And from here we go- I have no idea.
[13629.37s -> 13636.34s]  Over there? Watch out for the wrist rockets.
[13636.34s -> 13652.22s]  All right, sometimes you gotta pull like a gun and not just be a coward of lightning.
[13652.22s -> 13654.23s]  And then sometimes you put the lightning back in.
[13655.59s -> 13659.59s]  Watch out for wrist rockets. Watch out for wrist ro- I don't know why.
[13668.79s -> 13670.39s]  Super battle droid, knock him down.
[13670.39s -> 13693.02s]  That guy went further than anybody ever went. Watch those wrist- wait, is that like a Mandalorian
[13693.02s -> 13697.34s]  thing? Because he has like the- he's the wrist shooter that goes pew pew pew.
[13722.97s -> 13726.49s]  What the fuck, dude? Did I just die by my own lightsaber?
[13726.49s -> 13731.53s]  No, no, no. What happened? Have I not- did I not- why did- how is it possible I didn't save it?
[13732.66s -> 13737.06s]  It's impossible that I didn't save it. That's actually not even fucking possible.
[13737.62s -> 13754.70s]  Did I get a checkpoint? I don't think I did.
[13757.21s -> 13761.94s]  Cry, cry, cry. That's so annoying. What the hell?
[13762.82s -> 13765.14s]  How is it possible- I don't even- don't even fight anybody.
[13765.86s -> 13768.94s]  Just give it back to where I was. All right, I'll kill these guys.
[13780.42s -> 13785.53s]  Ooh, that hurt. You gonna cry?
[13786.65s -> 13790.01s]  No, sit up. No, I'm not.
[13791.21s -> 13811.53s]  I'm gonna do laundry tonight. Fuck.
[13812.65s -> 13828.01s]  I'm gonna do laundry tonight? Fuck.
[13828.01s -> 13831.05s]  You guys know what that's like, doing laundry, laundry day.
[13832.01s -> 13847.77s]  It's like six hours. All right, we're almost at the office building.
[13849.29s -> 13853.14s]  Jump. Can I fly this? This looks flyable, doesn't it?
[13853.70s -> 13856.52s]  Oh, that's unfortunate. It looks flyable.
[13857.24s -> 13875.62s]  I remember just laundry every six months.
[13875.62s -> 13881.96s]  No? I'm just saying, when you have a lot of load to do, it takes a while.
[13884.97s -> 13886.73s]  It's not something that just happens in like two minutes.
[13887.45s -> 13900.34s]  It didn't hit these two? Jedi Master.
[13900.34s -> 13923.13s]  Jedi. How big is- no, it's that stupid shield. It's so strong.
[13932.17s -> 13944.36s]  All right, keep going. Now from here, go this way.
[13944.36s -> 13950.42s]  Save, save, save. He's upset that his move doesn't instantly beat the game for him.
[13957.96s -> 13961.40s]  Not instantly, but speedily. I made it.
[13961.40s -> 13970.42s]  Okay, let's go. Where is he? I don't know who said that, but is it you?
[13971.14s -> 13976.46s]  Is that a Jedi? Hey, look out.
[13978.30s -> 13986.65s]  You say that's my third Jedi I've killed this week?
[13989.10s -> 13999.08s]  That's my third Jedi this week.
[14001.93s -> 14013.18s]  Cocky, all right. How do you like it?
[14013.18s -> 14016.22s]  Yeah, don't like it. Okay, don't like it, do you?
[14016.94s -> 14023.46s]  So it's a line of sight thing, right? You can't choke what you can't see.
[14024.34s -> 14041.80s]  I'll just kill your friend. Oh my fucking God, did I seriously get over it?
[14042.20s -> 14044.20s]  Did you kill me in one swing? Are you kidding me?
[14076.70s -> 14086.50s]  You see? I need full health going in here.
[14090.23s -> 14097.86s]  Or at least close to it. Full health and full Jedi meter.
[14097.86s -> 14112.06s]  Seriously shooting at me? I did not drop the difficulty.
[14112.70s -> 14117.67s]  I'm waiting for the Jedi meter to charge. Here we go.
[14117.67s -> 14131.38s]  No more messing around. Yeah, yeah. All it took was one.
[14133.18s -> 14141.66s]  What? He did- I did not change the difficulty. It's the same one it was.
[14148.36s -> 14149.96s]  Show the difficulty. I will.
[14153.18s -> 14161.58s]  Look. Setup. Video. Options. I don't even know where to show that.
[14161.58s -> 14164.90s]  I can't even show that. It's not on easy.
[14169.58s -> 14173.34s]  It's not on easy. It's not on easy. I swear to God.
[14173.34s -> 14184.63s]  I promise. I didn't- It's not on easy, I promise.
[14185.35s -> 14189.93s]  Next person to accuse me of this is gonna get tamed out for like fuck 10 seconds.
[14213.21s -> 14220.26s]  In his cube. And then somebody's shooting at me from outside.
[14220.82s -> 14228.63s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, get away from me.
[14229.59s -> 14234.94s]  It's one. Three diamonds? I'll take them.
[14251.18s -> 14259.56s]  Two down. Did someone just call me Jerma Andy?
[14260.28s -> 14263.98s]  Did I read that wrong?
[14287.42s -> 14288.78s]  What would I do in this scenario?
[14294.34s -> 14295.38s]  I would throw him out the window.
[14297.46s -> 14302.18s]  Nice.
[14306.82s -> 14309.34s]  Uh oh. All right. Covert operation time.
[14311.40s -> 14313.08s]  Sneak around. There's something going on on this planet.
[14324.74s -> 14331.10s]  Or script three. Sounds pretty good to me.
[14331.10s -> 14341.90s]  So I can hold him and smash him into stuff?
[14351.80s -> 14354.68s]  Show the difficulty. I will after this mission.
[14355.64s -> 14357.64s]  Don't think they expected us to find it.
[14357.64s -> 14360.47s]  Targeting computer will lock on kids.
[14360.47s -> 14363.35s]  Place them on key structural points then get out of there fast.
[14363.35s -> 14363.99s]  Oh, this sucks.
[14363.99s -> 14365.91s]  I'll be flying in lasers blazing.
[14365.91s -> 14367.35s]  If everything goes as planned,
[14367.35s -> 14369.67s]  we'll have the defenses down before they know what hit them.
[14370.31s -> 14373.91s]  This mission sucks. I already know.
[14373.91s -> 14375.91s]  Okay, Jaden. Start with the shield generator.
[14375.91s -> 14377.91s]  Otherwise, this will be a short mission.
[14377.91s -> 14390.22s]  I don't want to play this one. How do I get in?
[14407.46s -> 14414.55s]  Wait, what? Is he shooting at me?
[14414.55s -> 14422.52s]  Wait, I don't understand. Get over here.
[14422.52s -> 14427.27s]  Oh my god. I can slam their heads into stuff.
[14427.27s -> 14434.57s]  Hold on. One sec.
[14439.18s -> 14440.54s]  I promise it's not on easy.
[14441.34s -> 14447.98s]  I think he did. He shot his friend.
[14449.80s -> 14481.53s]  I didn't. What's he doing? Did I get him?
[14493.16s -> 14493.72s]  Monster.
[14514.18s -> 14515.54s]  They stole this from Gmod.
[14516.42s -> 14527.42s]  I know. Oh, I know. I can do this.
[14527.42s -> 14532.54s]  Oh, cool. I think it broke his neck.
[14532.54s -> 14545.90s]  Back up or does it go down?
[14556.58s -> 14573.37s]  I can throw these guys. Come here.
[14573.37s -> 14573.93s]  Get in here.
[14576.79s -> 14579.03s]  Okay, is he gonna? No, no, no, no.
[14579.91s -> 14592.92s]  He's still alive. Holy shit.
[14627.27s -> 14627.59s]  Clear.
[14645.35s -> 14647.21s]  I don't think I got off.
[14650.25s -> 14650.89s]  Okay, you got it.
[14652.33s -> 14653.21s]  You can go into the hangar.
[14653.77s -> 14657.43s]  Go difficulty now. I can't show the difficulty.
[14658.15s -> 14660.31s]  I have to start a new game to show the difficulty.
[14661.19s -> 14662.39s]  You can't change the difficulty.
[14671.45s -> 14673.29s]  That should weaken their resistance.
[14673.29s -> 14677.50s]  Up here into the garrison.
[14680.44s -> 14682.04s]  Open. Oh, come on. Really?
[14682.68s -> 14686.47s]  How do I get up there?
[14687.03s -> 14701.90s]  Jump on the frame?
[14702.78s -> 14705.32s]  The difficulty shows in the save menu. Does it?
[14705.88s -> 14706.95s]  What did I just do?
[14707.51s -> 14708.79s]  I pressed what button did I press?
[14711.35s -> 14713.59s]  Oh my fucking god, dude. I pressed F9.
[14713.59s -> 14715.83s]  I don't know why I pressed F9. I don't know what happened.
[14717.59s -> 14718.39s]  Did I save it at all?
[14719.11s -> 14721.91s]  What was quick quick load was what?
[14730.94s -> 14731.74s]  I pressed F9.
[14732.94s -> 14733.58s]  Oh, no.
[14734.38s -> 14749.85s]  This facility is lightly defended.
[14749.85s -> 14752.01s]  I don't think they expected us to find it.
[14752.01s -> 14753.93s]  My targeting computer will lock on to your.
[14764.20s -> 14765.77s]  I hit F9.
[14766.57s -> 14770.52s]  I don't know why I pressed F9.
[14770.52s -> 14773.72s]  I just wanted to show the stupid difficulty.
[14777.59s -> 14779.03s]  Can I go back to the base?
[14780.76s -> 14781.72s]  Can I go back to the base?
[14781.72s -> 14785.22s]  I don't want to do this one yet.
[14785.22s -> 14786.58s]  I don't want to do this one.
[14786.58s -> 14799.56s]  I just hit M moves.
[14803.56s -> 14804.06s]  No.
[14809.08s -> 14809.64s]  Speed.
[14809.64s -> 14810.28s]  Go fast.
[14811.00s -> 14822.12s]  Go back to the previous save.
[14822.12s -> 14823.72s]  Finish that mission and skip this one.
[14823.72s -> 14825.08s]  What a good fucking idea that is.
[14829.46s -> 14830.95s]  Wait.
[14830.95s -> 14832.31s]  No, that goes way too far back.
[14833.03s -> 14872.17s]  I was one plus space.
[14879.50s -> 14880.00s]  Nice.
[14892.68s -> 14893.80s]  He's alive still.
[14913.50s -> 14914.30s]  Get out of here.
[14914.30s -> 14915.02s]  You're nothing to me.
[14925.03s -> 14925.51s]  Where do I go?
[14941.74s -> 14942.86s]  Save, save, save, save.
[14942.86s -> 14943.36s]  I did it.
[14958.15s -> 14960.65s]  Press the lightsab in the press one while it's flying.
[14975.51s -> 14978.39s]  Do the doi version?
[14989.50s -> 14990.76s]  Is that what you wanted?
[14991.48s -> 15011.18s]  Do doi version of duel of fates.
[15015.90s -> 15023.18s]  Do doi version of duel of fates.
[15023.18s -> 15026.09s]  Okay.
[15027.03s -> 15027.43s]  Now what?
[15046.46s -> 15047.18s]  What is that from?
[15048.70s -> 15051.02s]  Oh my god, what's that from?
[15051.02s -> 15051.58s]  That scream.
[15052.38s -> 15053.75s]  What the hell is it from?
[15058.42s -> 15060.50s]  No, no, no, not Tom and Jerry.
[15060.50s -> 15061.14s]  Not Wilhelm.
[15068.92s -> 15069.72s]  What is it from?
[15072.25s -> 15073.13s]  No, not Howie.
[15073.77s -> 15074.81s]  It's very specific.
[15078.84s -> 15079.34s]  Shit.
[15083.48s -> 15084.04s]  Bop it.
[15084.04s -> 15084.36s]  Bop it.
[15084.36s -> 15085.00s]  You got it.
[15085.00s -> 15085.72s]  Yes, somebody got it.
[15085.72s -> 15086.60s]  It's the bop it sound.
[15086.60s -> 15087.64s]  It's the bop it scream.
[15087.64s -> 15088.20s]  I want to hear it.
[15089.40s -> 15089.96s]  Don't clip it.
[15089.96s -> 15090.92s]  I want to see it.
[15090.92s -> 15093.10s]  That's you failed bop it.
[15093.10s -> 15097.86s]  That's like that.
[15099.14s -> 15101.30s]  I want to hear it.
[15101.30s -> 15104.44s]  I need to hear it.
[15104.44s -> 15107.50s]  Don't clip it.
[15107.50s -> 15108.46s]  What do you clip it?
[15108.46s -> 15109.82s]  What do you come on?
[15113.30s -> 15114.18s]  Don't you want to know?
[15115.24s -> 15115.64s]  What is this?
[15115.64s -> 15116.36s]  You're linking.
[15116.36s -> 15116.84s]  I don't know.
[15116.84s -> 15118.04s]  This is not why.
[15118.04s -> 15121.91s]  No, don't link me the actual bop it scream.
[15122.55s -> 15126.43s]  Okay.
[15128.09s -> 15130.49s]  Now link me the clip that just happened.
[15130.49s -> 15135.70s]  We'll compare them.
[15135.70s -> 15138.02s]  Okay, here's this one.
[15141.45s -> 15151.88s]  Same exact thing.
[15173.83s -> 15174.47s]  Reverse it.
[15175.03s -> 15182.07s]  Where are we going?
[15184.71s -> 15185.19s]  Look out.
[15205.27s -> 15208.15s]  Activate order number 66.
[15210.06s -> 15210.70s]  Yes, sir.
[15210.70s -> 15211.26s]  Right away.
[15216.62s -> 15221.66s]  Activate number order 66.
[15237.94s -> 15238.98s]  John Oliver.
[15238.98s -> 15239.48s]  What?
[15240.02s -> 15242.74s]  Oh my God.
[15242.74s -> 15243.22s]  Did you see what happened?
[15243.22s -> 15244.02s]  A guy dropped somebody.
[15244.66s -> 15259.86s]  Activate order number 666.
[15260.66s -> 15279.74s]  This thing is ripping him.
[15287.06s -> 15288.26s]  Oh, he doesn't have a gun.
[15288.26s -> 15291.67s]  You're going to get out of him.
[15291.67s -> 15292.79s]  It's a crazy cycle.
[15294.71s -> 15295.35s]  Run, run.
[15295.35s -> 15296.63s]  He's crazy.
[15296.63s -> 15297.19s]  He's crazy.
[15297.19s -> 15298.47s]  There's a crazy guy on the loose.
[15328.20s -> 15333.08s]  Activate order number 666.
[15354.82s -> 15356.34s]  Activate order number 6.
[15356.34s -> 15356.98s]  I just did it too.
[15356.98s -> 15357.48s]  I did it.
[15366.90s -> 15379.14s]  Enhance my order with extra things in it.
[15379.94s -> 15387.43s]  Hey, you're supposed to be dead.
[15396.28s -> 15397.96s]  Activate order 66.
[15399.53s -> 15400.49s]  Extra mayonnaise.
[15405.05s -> 15405.85s]  Side of pickles.
[15410.22s -> 15413.10s]  It's a family guy tear joke.
[15413.10s -> 15414.46s]  Nobody even said it, but I said it.
[15415.26s -> 15425.18s]  No, no, no.
[15425.18s -> 15425.82s]  I'll do one more.
[15425.82s -> 15427.34s]  That's a robot chicken joke.

[15438.82s -> 15440.02s]  I want a McDonald's toy.
[15444.62s -> 15447.10s]  I don't think they make McDonald's toys anymore, sir.
[15447.10s -> 15448.94s]  I don't think they make McDonald's toys anymore.
[15448.94s -> 15449.66s]  Get on it.
[15464.89s -> 15466.01s]  Where's it going?
[15466.01s -> 15477.74s]  Save the game.
[15477.74s -> 15478.22s]  Thank you.
[15479.02s -> 15480.22s]  We got to save Andy's.
[15488.55s -> 15489.51s]  Go back up.
[15489.51s -> 15490.95s]  I don't even care.
[15492.15s -> 15494.55s]  They don't send the guy with the electric hands to do this.
[15495.51s -> 15498.23s]  This is a mission for a covert stealth operator.
[15498.87s -> 15500.36s]  Not the guy that can do this.
[15501.16s -> 15513.77s]  I don't even know where they want me to go.
[15513.77s -> 15514.25s]  Where do I go?
[15523.91s -> 15524.47s]  Back up here?
[15525.03s -> 15538.30s]  Execute order number 66666.
[15538.30s -> 15540.50s]  Press M.
[15541.14s -> 15543.32s]  Yeah, I got to go on the top of the building.
[15544.04s -> 15548.71s]  There's no order in the quote.
[15548.71s -> 15549.11s]  There's not?
[15553.16s -> 15554.04s]  What's the actual quote?
[15554.04s -> 15556.78s]  It's activate order 66.
[15557.50s -> 15559.42s]  Execute order number 66.
[15559.42s -> 15560.22s]  What's the actual quote?
[15561.27s -> 15562.15s]  Activate order.
[15562.15s -> 15562.71s]  Yes, there is.
[15563.35s -> 15563.83s]  Execute.
[15564.71s -> 15571.24s]  The line is activate number 66.
[15571.96s -> 15576.98s]  No, it's like execute order number six.
[15576.98s -> 15577.86s]  What is it actually, though?
[15578.66s -> 15580.36s]  No, it's not.
[15580.36s -> 15581.48s]  So what is the actual one?
[15582.36s -> 15584.12s]  Execute order 66.
[15585.58s -> 15588.78s]  Execute order 666.
[15589.82s -> 15590.84s]  I get it.
[15590.84s -> 15591.88s]  No, it's just two sixes.
[15592.44s -> 15601.38s]  Now that doesn't sound right anymore.
[15601.38s -> 15603.30s]  Execute order 666.
[15605.61s -> 15606.57s]  No, doesn't sound right.
[15607.29s -> 15610.36s]  It's like activate order number 666.
[15616.25s -> 15618.49s]  Activate order number 66.
[15619.05s -> 15633.85s]  Execute order 66.
[15633.85s -> 15635.05s]  That sounds fake.
[15635.05s -> 15636.57s]  That sounds made up, doesn't it?
[15636.57s -> 15637.93s]  That sounds like a fake one.
[15639.02s -> 15641.98s]  Execute order 66.
[15641.98s -> 15643.26s]  I feel like mine was better.
[15643.98s -> 15644.70s]  What's happening?
[15647.38s -> 15650.94s]  What do we need to do to get out of the kelp forest?
[15653.58s -> 15661.43s]  Time has come.
[15661.43s -> 15663.83s]  Execute order 66.
[15663.83s -> 15667.43s]  No, it's activate order number 666.
[15668.23s -> 15668.87s]  Mine's better.
[15669.96s -> 15670.36s]  Don't worry.
[15670.36s -> 15672.52s]  George Lucas will redo these movies like five more times.
[15672.52s -> 15673.40s]  He'll use mine later.
[15674.04s -> 15678.18s]  Disney will remaster this like a remastered remaster.
[15678.74s -> 15681.94s]  They'll come up with a black and white version for fucking no reason in like 30 years.
[15681.94s -> 15682.34s]  Don't worry.
[15696.25s -> 15696.81s]  Oh, shit.
[15696.81s -> 15697.85s]  I just blocked that twice.
[15706.12s -> 15706.92s]  I need to go up.
[15707.64s -> 15713.72s]  Oh, I need to go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[15713.72s -> 15717.67s]  I can't go up this one.
[15717.67s -> 15718.71s]  Can I go up this one?
[15719.27s -> 15721.88s]  Why would he say 666 though?
[15721.88s -> 15722.76s]  Because it's like Satan.
[15733.85s -> 15735.05s]  Why can I not activate this?
[15742.30s -> 15743.18s]  Playing with fire there.
[15743.18s -> 15743.82s]  I got to stop.
[15747.75s -> 15748.39s]  It's broken.
[15749.11s -> 15753.38s]  Oh, well, I see people over here.
[15770.74s -> 15771.86s]  I just caught him by the neck.
[15772.42s -> 15773.30s]  Oh, my God.
[15773.30s -> 15773.94s]  That's horrible.
[15773.94s -> 15780.23s]  I caught him by his neck and the force snapped it when it came down.
[15782.10s -> 15783.22s]  That was horrible.
[15783.22s -> 15785.06s]  Don't I don't I don't I never want to do that again.
[15788.89s -> 15790.09s]  Big rectangle building.
[15790.65s -> 15793.26s]  I went up there.
[15794.06s -> 15795.18s]  I need to get up though.
[15795.82s -> 15798.58s]  None of these have like a way to go in or up.
[15808.17s -> 15810.81s]  Rectangle, rectangle.
[15810.81s -> 15811.29s]  Yeah, I know.
[15811.29s -> 15813.69s]  But I'm trying I'm trying to find a way up.
[15813.69s -> 15819.96s]  I need to go up.
[15821.26s -> 15821.90s]  Up, not down.
[15821.90s -> 15822.46s]  I want to go up.
[15823.10s -> 15826.50s]  This game is so painfully easy, Omega Lo.
[15827.14s -> 15830.33s]  You're fired.
[15830.33s -> 15838.22s]  I'm throwing one of the green shit.
[15838.78s -> 15843.90s]  You're fired.
[15860.09s -> 15861.77s]  Finally, I just had to press one button.
[15867.00s -> 15876.06s]  All right.
[15876.06s -> 15878.70s]  So I got to go that way.
[15878.70s -> 15879.74s]  Don't die from fall damage.
[15882.84s -> 15883.24s]  Hey, you.
[15897.42s -> 15899.18s]  What the fuck was I doing that for?
[15900.06s -> 15904.44s]  I want to do like a cool exit.
[15907.27s -> 15909.03s]  My God, please, Jared, stop.
[15909.99s -> 15911.59s]  You're gonna fucking freak me out.
[15911.59s -> 15912.31s]  Just stop.
[15912.31s -> 15914.15s]  I'm just trying to rush so much.
[15930.66s -> 15931.54s]  He's too high.
[15932.18s -> 15933.06s]  I'm not high.
[15934.86s -> 15937.18s]  I don't you know, I'm a high every day, guys.
[15937.18s -> 15937.66s]  Relax.
[15938.54s -> 15944.14s]  I'm gonna vaporize this guy.
[15944.14s -> 15944.64s]  Hold on.
[15966.46s -> 15974.78s]  How do I pick these up?
[15975.58s -> 15980.79s]  Is this Halloween?
[15980.79s -> 15981.19s]  No, no, no.
[15981.19s -> 15982.15s]  That was Duel of Fates.
[15983.53s -> 15984.81s]  This is Halloween.
[15984.81s -> 15986.25s]  This is Halloween.
[15986.25s -> 15987.61s]  This is Halloween.
[15989.21s -> 15989.85s]  Now they're different.
[15990.57s -> 15992.62s]  They're different enough.
[15994.94s -> 15995.74s]  Let's go up.
[15995.74s -> 15996.62s]  This goes down.
[15996.62s -> 15997.66s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[15997.66s -> 15998.54s]  I'm gonna lose my mind.
[16019.22s -> 16028.90s]  Come on.
[16032.94s -> 16034.22s]  What the fuck do I do?
[16035.18s -> 16043.66s]  I don't like this mission either.
[16043.66s -> 16044.54s]  This one's stupid.
[16047.80s -> 16048.76s]  I'm gonna stand right here
[16048.76s -> 16050.76s]  and you guys tell me what direction to walk in.
[16050.76s -> 16055.67s]  Should I go left that way or right this way?
[16055.67s -> 16064.65s]  Oh, immediate left.
[16073.51s -> 16075.40s]  Oh, a TIE fighter crashed in here.
[16076.12s -> 16079.61s]  The boss.
[16081.08s -> 16083.48s]  Yes, my liege.
[16087.42s -> 16108.44s]  All right.
[16108.44s -> 16109.16s]  Now where?
[16109.16s -> 16110.62s]  Wait, where do I go now?
[16132.63s -> 16136.06s]  Can you learn the toxic choreography for us?
[16147.37s -> 16147.93s]  I went up.
[16148.81s -> 16149.53s]  I went up.
[16150.47s -> 16152.07s]  Now what am I supposed to do?
[16152.07s -> 16153.19s]  I hate this.
[16153.19s -> 16154.57s]  I can't go in there.
[16155.13s -> 16168.41s]  Oh, my God.
[16168.41s -> 16169.61s]  I fucking hate this.
[16169.61s -> 16170.49s]  Are you serious?
[16170.49s -> 16171.69s]  This is too easy.
[16174.97s -> 16176.17s]  Fire yourself out of a cannon.
[16182.70s -> 16184.38s]  Next, take out the communications array.
[16184.46s -> 16186.52s]  So they can't signal for help.
[16186.52s -> 16187.64s]  Okay, I will.
[16188.68s -> 16190.36s]  Here goes the communications array.
[16191.08s -> 16195.08s]  I gotta go all the way across the whole damn planet.
[16202.92s -> 16210.66s]  SpongeBob.
[16210.66s -> 16211.46s]  SpongeBob.
[16212.18s -> 16212.98s]  SpongeBob.
[16213.54s -> 16215.88s]  Yeah, SpongeBob.
[16217.16s -> 16218.92s]  Where's the communications thing?
[16218.92s -> 16219.40s]  It was over here.
[16219.96s -> 16220.58s]  Where?
[16221.06s -> 16225.75s]  Where is it?
[16226.47s -> 16227.53s]  Over here?
[16227.53s -> 16251.27s]  Going up here?
[16251.27s -> 16252.31s]  Why is this not fixed?
[16253.59s -> 16257.03s]  Stop fucking around.
[16257.03s -> 16258.63s]  It's up there, isn't it?
[16258.63s -> 16261.91s]  I need to get up there.
[16261.91s -> 16263.91s]  So I need to go in here and go...
[16263.91s -> 16264.95s]  How do I get up to here?
[16267.77s -> 16271.29s]  Activate elevator number 666.
[16271.29s -> 16284.76s]  I didn't...
[16284.76s -> 16285.72s]  Somebody in chat said that.
[16285.72s -> 16286.76s]  I just read it out loud.
[16300.62s -> 16300.94s]  Okay.
[16301.98s -> 16303.50s]  Open the door.
[16303.50s -> 16305.50s]  And I go to the communications depot.
[16306.46s -> 16309.62s]  Did you miss any funny German moments?
[16309.62s -> 16311.22s]  You missed a big one.
[16322.95s -> 16323.35s]  All right.
[16323.35s -> 16323.67s]  Boom.
[16326.04s -> 16333.32s]  Say the funny 66 line.
[16333.32s -> 16333.88s]  All right, sure.
[16340.09s -> 16341.13s]  How does it get from Boston?
[16345.78s -> 16346.50s]  It's down there, right?
[16347.14s -> 16365.94s]  All right.
[16365.94s -> 16367.46s]  I'm supposed to do the 66 thing.
[16368.50s -> 16373.38s]  Activate order number 66.
[16374.18s -> 16378.79s]  Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
[16378.79s -> 16389.11s]  Wait, I can...
[16403.56s -> 16404.76s]  Star Wars fans are leaving?
[16404.76s -> 16405.40s]  Why would they?
[16405.40s -> 16408.12s]  I'm one of the only people playing a Star Wars game on Twitch right now.
[16409.24s -> 16410.38s]  You're all here.
[16411.18s -> 16416.50s]  Where is it?
[16419.19s -> 16420.07s]  In the command center.
[16420.87s -> 16421.67s]  Straight up from here.
[16422.39s -> 16426.52s]  Everyone here right now is a Star Wars fan.
[16431.82s -> 16434.14s]  Drop two and a half thousand viewers when the streams peak.
[16436.47s -> 16438.63s]  You know how many people had to go to dinner like two hours ago?
[16439.27s -> 16445.08s]  All right, I'm gonna get up there.
[16445.64s -> 16450.65s]  Now how many people went to dinner two hours ago?
[16450.65s -> 16451.05s]  I did.
[16452.01s -> 16466.36s]  I went BRB and I ate a bowl of spaghetti as fast as I could.
[16467.00s -> 16475.67s]  All right, so this is all the way up or where are we?
[16476.31s -> 16479.88s]  This is the last one.
[16479.88s -> 16481.24s]  It's like right up here, isn't it?
[16481.24s -> 16482.04s]  Go up even higher?
[16495.11s -> 16496.71s]  Who's saying that?
[16499.72s -> 16500.36s]  Oh, it's you.
[16544.06s -> 16544.78s]  No honor.
[16547.11s -> 16548.79s]  Just like throwing knives at him.
[16551.80s -> 16553.16s]  And the final one is...
[16554.30s -> 16555.26s]  All the way up.
[16555.26s -> 16565.18s]  Got the rocket ammo.
[16565.74s -> 16568.58s]  Dude, I got rocket ammo.
[16568.58s -> 16570.10s]  I don't know what that means, but I got it.
[16573.64s -> 16574.44s]  It's a different building.
[16575.08s -> 16581.42s]  Which building is it?
[16581.42s -> 16591.19s]  That one right here?
[16591.19s -> 16591.99s]  Yeah, it's this one right here.
[16592.71s -> 16593.94s]  Right in the middle, right?
[16594.58s -> 16598.50s]  Don't die!
[16598.50s -> 16600.10s]  Holy shit, I'm okay.
[16600.98s -> 16606.25s]  Secret area.
[16606.25s -> 16610.54s]  All right, it's right...
[16610.54s -> 16611.58s]  Where is it? In here?
[16611.58s -> 16623.70s]  How do I get in this?
[16623.70s -> 16652.18s]  How do I get up there?
[16654.81s -> 16661.13s]  Oh, he looked at chat once in the last 10 minutes.
[16663.32s -> 16664.12s]  Um, hold on.
[16664.12s -> 16664.76s]  I'm currently...
[16664.76s -> 16665.80s]  I'm a little busy right now.
[16666.36s -> 16676.81s]  I don't even know what's shooting at me.
[16680.28s -> 16681.88s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16701.58s -> 16704.94s]  Oh, fuck off with this bullshit.
[16704.94s -> 16706.95s]  Are you serious?
[16706.95s -> 16707.83s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[16715.08s -> 16715.80s]  No way.
[16715.80s -> 16716.76s]  This is so dumb.
[16717.64s -> 16725.54s]  Well, let's go back this way first, I guess.
[16728.44s -> 16729.16s]  I went over here too.
[16730.39s -> 16731.67s]  Yeah, this is all in a line.
[16731.67s -> 16732.07s]  Let's go.
[16732.63s -> 16735.34s]  I don't know, just...
[16735.34s -> 16738.86s]  I fucking fat fingered and pressed dash.
[16740.65s -> 16742.49s]  I pressed plus instead of dash.
[16742.49s -> 16743.13s]  I pressed...
[16743.93s -> 16748.33s]  They're both right next to each other.
[16748.33s -> 16750.25s]  And I just pressed them both the same goddamn time.
[16750.97s -> 16752.22s]  Whatever.
[16752.22s -> 16752.94s]  It doesn't even matter.
[16752.94s -> 16754.14s]  I'm gonna get up there and just wait.
[16754.14s -> 16754.62s]  Just watch.
[16754.62s -> 16755.02s]  I got it.
[16755.02s -> 16755.50s]  Everything's fine.
[16757.10s -> 16760.30s]  Yeah, I mean, give me...
[16760.30s -> 16761.42s]  Where's the fucking elevator?
[16762.30s -> 16771.30s]  Oh, go in that door!
[16789.61s -> 16791.85s]  Jayden, look out.
[16791.85s -> 16792.89s]  They've got tanks.
[16792.89s -> 16793.85s]  They've got tanks.
[16793.85s -> 16794.25s]  They've got...
[16794.25s -> 16795.13s]  How do I end up down here?
[16796.70s -> 16798.86s]  Tank, tank!
[16798.86s -> 16807.54s]  Where is it?
[16808.34s -> 16809.94s]  Oh, you're so scary.
[16809.94s -> 16810.82s]  You're so scary.
[16816.12s -> 16817.00s]  Just whatever.
[16817.00s -> 16817.24s]  Go.
[16817.96s -> 16830.23s]  It's the first one.
[16830.23s -> 16831.27s]  One, two, three in a row.
[16833.85s -> 16834.65s]  He's throwing.
[16834.65s -> 16835.53s]  I'm not throwing.
[16835.53s -> 16836.17s]  I'm fine.
[16845.61s -> 16846.33s]  All right, here we go.
[16846.33s -> 16849.05s]  One, two, three.
[16850.33s -> 16854.47s]  Have you been drinking?
[16854.47s -> 16855.27s]  No, I'm not drinking.
[16855.27s -> 16856.23s]  I'm just having a...
[16856.23s -> 16857.19s]  I'm just messing around.
[16857.19s -> 16858.39s]  Everybody needs to relax
[16858.39s -> 16859.59s]  before I get angry with you.
[16860.23s -> 16865.46s]  You know what?
[16865.46s -> 16866.26s]  Do you know how I can see him?
[16878.09s -> 16879.85s]  One, two, three.
[16879.85s -> 16880.33s]  Okay.
[16880.33s -> 16880.73s]  Over here.
[16887.90s -> 16889.42s]  Dude's in a drunken rage.
[16890.22s -> 16893.46s]  How much did I sleep last night?
[16894.02s -> 16895.46s]  Um, like an hour?
[16896.10s -> 16896.74s]  What even?
[16896.74s -> 16897.22s]  30 minutes?
[16898.26s -> 16913.64s]  All right, deactivate.
[16920.07s -> 16920.71s]  Go to bed?
[16922.28s -> 16922.68s]  I will.
[16923.56s -> 16923.88s]  Later.
[16924.44s -> 16926.06s]  No, I slept like seven hours.
[16931.18s -> 16932.30s]  Uh, two more over here.
[16946.07s -> 16946.39s]  No, it's...
[16947.19s -> 16949.46s]  Turn this shit off.
[16950.10s -> 16957.08s]  You're doing great, Jayden.
[16957.98s -> 16958.86s]  Only one more.
[16974.87s -> 16975.19s]  Got it.
[16975.19s -> 16976.23s]  That did it.
[16976.23s -> 16977.75s]  Get back in your ship, Jayden.
[16977.75s -> 16978.55s]  We're out of here.
[16979.43s -> 16979.75s]  All right.
[16979.75s -> 16981.51s]  Where's my ship?
[16983.70s -> 16984.50s]  Do you know where it is?
[16984.50s -> 16984.98s]  I don't know.
[16986.49s -> 16987.45s]  I have no idea.
[16994.44s -> 16995.08s]  Big hanger?
[16995.64s -> 17006.34s]  Where is that?
[17006.98s -> 17016.79s]  Joe, what's your big hanger?
[17018.09s -> 17020.38s]  Um, it's down?
[17020.94s -> 17024.02s]  Oh, it just fell off.
[17030.07s -> 17030.95s]  Down there?
[17030.95s -> 17035.13s]  Where is it?
[17043.74s -> 17044.14s]  Over there.
[17046.70s -> 17047.26s]  Pretending?
[17047.82s -> 17049.10s]  No, I haven't paid a...
[17049.10s -> 17052.38s]  Guys, I have not paid a single attention to anything that has happened in this entire
[17052.38s -> 17053.18s]  level because I hate it.
[17055.29s -> 17056.17s]  I hate this level.
[17056.17s -> 17060.09s]  So I've just been going through the motions to just kill things and walk around in circles
[17060.09s -> 17061.05s]  till somebody says stop.
[17061.61s -> 17063.05s]  Like one of you guys says just...
[17063.05s -> 17063.69s]  Oh, they're left.
[17063.69s -> 17064.09s]  Like, okay.
[17064.65s -> 17081.30s]  I made it.
[17094.71s -> 17095.58s]  Good for us.
[17108.20s -> 17108.44s]  Hmm.
[17109.24s -> 17113.45s]  What's a good one?
[17116.30s -> 17117.34s]  Uh, probably gonna do one more.
[17118.14s -> 17118.46s]  What's...
[17118.46s -> 17119.66s]  What's the best one on this list?
[17120.86s -> 17130.20s]  Cult Investigation or Meet Contact.
[17131.86s -> 17133.70s]  Cult, cult, cult, cult, cult, cult.
[17134.34s -> 17136.68s]  People saying this one's good.
[17136.68s -> 17140.97s]  This is a driving level?
[17140.97s -> 17141.21s]  Done.
[17145.34s -> 17161.40s]  It is...
[17161.40s -> 17162.36s]  Holy shit, it is.
[17162.36s -> 17163.16s]  It's a full letter grid.
[17163.88s -> 17175.58s]  Oh, why did I just do that weird skip?
[17176.14s -> 17178.07s]  That was really bizarre.
[17178.79s -> 17190.20s]  Um, wait, why?
[17191.64s -> 17192.20s]  What's happening?
[17197.64s -> 17200.39s]  I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[17200.39s -> 17201.59s]  There were no instructions.
[17202.39s -> 17203.91s]  There was not a single instruction.
[17206.18s -> 17207.14s]  I shook this guy's hand.
[17207.14s -> 17209.78s]  I did like a little frolic onto the motorcycle and...
[17210.66s -> 17224.34s]  Okay, I'm just...
[17224.34s -> 17227.06s]  This is really hard to control with a mouse and keyboard.
[17232.36s -> 17233.32s]  Okay, I think we're good.
[17241.58s -> 17243.34s]  Meet the contact that has outpost.
[17244.06s -> 17246.09s]  Where's this guy's...
[17246.09s -> 17247.21s]  Where's his outpost?
[17261.32s -> 17262.12s]  Wrong way.
[17264.22s -> 17265.50s]  Use your lightsaber?
[17271.35s -> 17272.15s]  What?
[17272.15s -> 17273.27s]  Why am I still alive?
[17273.99s -> 17274.95s]  I'm still alive.
[17299.77s -> 17301.53s]  With a long drive all over again.
[17308.09s -> 17308.41s]  What?
[17317.59s -> 17317.99s]  Just die.
[17317.99s -> 17318.39s]  How do I...
[17318.39s -> 17318.79s]  Just die.
[17318.79s -> 17319.19s]  Die.
[17319.19s -> 17319.43s]  Die.
[17336.39s -> 17337.67s]  Okay, so where do I go?
[17342.78s -> 17343.26s]  This way?
[17343.98s -> 17360.47s]  You guys did still.
[17368.76s -> 17370.76s]  It's literally a racetrack.
[17370.76s -> 17378.07s]  Okay, but didn't it say I was going the wrong way when I went this way?
[17378.07s -> 17378.31s]  Yeah.
[17378.31s -> 17379.91s]  So what the fuck do I do here?
[17386.78s -> 17387.98s]  Do I have to jump through?
[17389.74s -> 17390.06s]  What?
[17398.70s -> 17402.94s]  God, what happened?
[17402.94s -> 17403.82s]  Jump through it?
[17404.46s -> 17406.42s]  I don't know what you mean.
[17407.72s -> 17409.00s]  How do I jump with this?
[17413.43s -> 17416.23s]  Oh, you mean like actually jump just me.
[17416.79s -> 17428.10s]  What the hell?
[17428.10s -> 17428.82s]  That's not fun.
[17429.46s -> 17438.78s]  Isn't that Luke?
[17445.50s -> 17446.62s]  Yeah, I ran into some trouble.
[17448.62s -> 17450.14s]  I really fucked up a few times.
[17467.54s -> 17469.62s]  Okay, so so far so good.
[17470.34s -> 17472.34s]  I want the purple one.
[17477.05s -> 17477.85s]  Give me any of them.
[17478.49s -> 17486.89s]  I can't get on it.
[17486.89s -> 17488.17s]  Get on the bike, dude.
[17488.17s -> 17488.89s]  Get on the bike.
[17489.69s -> 17489.93s]  Get...
[17504.47s -> 17505.43s]  I hit the gas.
[17505.43s -> 17507.43s]  I pressed the gas way too hard.
[17508.23s -> 17509.35s]  If you go in a go-kart
[17511.18s -> 17513.42s]  and you press down on the gas pedal way too hard,
[17513.42s -> 17514.78s]  you go fucking flying.
[17526.42s -> 17528.02s]  Major whiff flash.
[17533.80s -> 17534.52s]  I just did something.
[17534.52s -> 17535.08s]  What did I just do?
[17566.47s -> 17568.71s]  Just get me the fuck out of here.
[17568.71s -> 17569.67s]  Get me out of here.
[17571.43s -> 17572.71s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[17572.71s -> 17573.43s]  Give me the bike back.
[17575.11s -> 17584.95s]  Give me that bike.
[17612.02s -> 17612.58s]  Jump off.
[17613.30s -> 17622.89s]  Oh, shit.
[17622.89s -> 17624.17s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[17624.17s -> 17634.26s]  Looks like I'm not going back that...
[17634.26s -> 17634.50s]  All right.
[17638.89s -> 17642.10s]  I didn't even...
[17642.82s -> 17644.90s]  Hey, he's coming kind of right for me.
[17644.90s -> 17645.38s]  He's kind of...
[17646.26s -> 17660.09s]  What's happening?
[17676.17s -> 17678.01s]  This dude, what's going on?
[17678.01s -> 17678.49s]  Why is he...
[17686.98s -> 17688.26s]  He's like, all right, man.
[17688.26s -> 17689.14s]  All right, you win.
[17691.99s -> 17693.27s]  Did he put a grenade down?
[17693.27s -> 17693.99s]  I don't even know.
[17699.67s -> 17699.91s]  No.
[17706.97s -> 17707.77s]  I'm going to pass out.
[17707.77s -> 17708.41s]  I have to hold on.
[17710.76s -> 17711.08s]  Hold on.
[17711.08s -> 17712.76s]  I'm going to pass out if I don't fucking stop.
[17719.32s -> 17720.28s]  The guy behind me.
[17721.40s -> 17723.24s]  He went very far, by the way.
[17725.16s -> 17732.86s]  This is so hard to control with the mouse.
[17738.81s -> 17739.45s]  Okay.
[17739.45s -> 17740.57s]  So should I go over there?
[17745.61s -> 17747.13s]  Spam D on your keyboard.
[17747.85s -> 17748.95s]  I'm not going to do that.
[17751.16s -> 17756.82s]  Where are the enemies?
[17757.62s -> 17758.95s]  Oh, here they come.
[17760.06s -> 17760.46s]  Stop.
[17761.10s -> 17761.59s]  Okay.
[17762.31s -> 17764.97s]  It's a tiny hole to go in.
[17767.94s -> 17768.34s]  Goodness.
[17769.06s -> 17775.19s]  Cool.
[17775.19s -> 17775.59s]  All right.
[17775.59s -> 17776.07s]  Keep going.
[17776.87s -> 17782.22s]  I don't know what is doing, but it was just dragging me around like crazy.
[17784.34s -> 17786.58s]  I do not feel very much in control right now at all.
[17800.70s -> 17801.90s]  What is going on?
[17805.18s -> 17806.14s]  What is going on?
[17806.86s -> 17813.34s]  Wait, didn't I just do this?
[17817.86s -> 17829.32s]  I had no control of what was just going on at all.
[17830.36s -> 17838.52s]  Get away from me.
[17838.52s -> 17841.98s]  What am I...
[17841.98s -> 17842.70s]  Why am I watching?
[17843.42s -> 17844.22s]  What?
[17844.22s -> 17846.44s]  Why did I need to see that?
[17848.54s -> 17855.53s]  Wait, I'm in the...
[17855.53s -> 17856.09s]  I can't move.
[17859.29s -> 17860.73s]  Get the fuck off the wall.
[17865.48s -> 17867.08s]  Why are they all doing this?
[17868.41s -> 17872.90s]  Turn this way?
[17876.86s -> 17878.78s]  Oh my fucking God.
[17878.78s -> 17879.02s]  Where...
[17880.57s -> 17881.13s]  Get off.
[17881.13s -> 17882.65s]  Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off.
[17893.43s -> 17894.71s]  I can't control the motorcycle.
[17894.71s -> 17896.63s]  It just flies the fuck out of the way.
[17896.63s -> 17897.43s]  I can't do anything.
[17898.23s -> 17899.77s]  Do I even get on it?
[17905.74s -> 17906.22s]  I'm...
[17906.22s -> 17906.94s]  Stop boosting.
[17906.94s -> 17907.82s]  I didn't even boost.
[17908.62s -> 17909.82s]  It just threw me up there.
[17911.10s -> 17916.66s]  All right, I boosted there because I had to.
[17917.30s -> 17918.81s]  Wait, why...
[17919.69s -> 17921.46s]  You turn with the mouse?
[17921.46s -> 17923.62s]  Yeah, it's like dog shit.
[17939.00s -> 17940.36s]  It's so hard.
[17940.92s -> 17941.96s]  It's so hard.
[17941.96s -> 17943.32s]  It's so annoying to control.
[17947.29s -> 17947.93s]  I can't.
[17947.93s -> 17948.17s]  I...
[17948.97s -> 17950.54s]  My fucking God.
[17950.54s -> 17951.98s]  I just fell out of the sky.
[17951.98s -> 17953.50s]  Like I fell out of the goddamn sky.
[17954.14s -> 17955.98s]  I don't have to nose bleed?
[17956.78s -> 17957.02s]  No.
[17958.17s -> 17958.89s]  What?
[17958.89s -> 17966.89s]  Did I just go in this building?
[17967.53s -> 17969.29s]  I don't even know what way is the right way anymore.
[17969.93s -> 17970.81s]  What's the correct way?
[17971.45s -> 17972.70s]  Just in the building.
[17973.42s -> 17978.78s]  Okay, five people just died.
[17991.77s -> 18005.03s]  Uh, did I do it?
[18005.59s -> 18020.82s]  Don't strafe.
[18024.89s -> 18026.33s]  I'm not doing that.
[18026.33s -> 18028.57s]  I'm telling you right now, I'm not doing that.
[18034.23s -> 18035.11s]  Okay, I made it.
[18035.75s -> 18036.66s]  By going...
[18037.94s -> 18043.45s]  Escape from the mercenaries and make your way to the far city gate.
[18055.67s -> 18056.07s]  Save it.
[18056.63s -> 18065.72s]  I think I'm getting close, I think.
[18066.28s -> 18072.38s]  I have no idea what just happened.
[18072.38s -> 18072.86s]  Is this it?
[18073.50s -> 18079.82s]  Why do I feel like I'm...
[18079.82s -> 18081.34s]  Use turbo to jump the chasm.
[18081.98s -> 18088.44s]  It didn't make it.
[18101.30s -> 18102.26s]  Uh, now...
[18102.90s -> 18104.50s]  This way.
[18117.91s -> 18118.55s]  Got him.
[18118.55s -> 18123.13s]  Give me your fucking bike right now.
[18123.13s -> 18127.54s]  My fucking God.
[18127.54s -> 18132.73s]  Oh my God.
[18133.61s -> 18160.12s]  I'm not doing...
[18160.12s -> 18169.82s]  Oh my fucking God.
[18169.82s -> 18170.62s]  Dude, why?
[18171.34s -> 18174.22s]  Give me one of your bikes right now before I freak out.
[18174.86s -> 18175.74s]  They just squished me with...
[18175.74s -> 18177.58s]  They squished my heads together like...
[18177.58s -> 18177.82s]  Too...
[18190.07s -> 18190.31s]  Get...
[18193.50s -> 18194.22s]  Leave me alone.
[18200.01s -> 18200.65s]  Give me that bike.
[18201.13s -> 18202.57s]  His bike is in better condition than mine.
[18203.29s -> 18204.57s]  It just fucking exploded.
[18211.24s -> 18212.04s]  There's the gate!
[18212.68s -> 18213.64s]  I made it to the gate!
[18224.94s -> 18225.50s]  Thank God.
[18229.66s -> 18230.46s]  Oh, thank goodness.
[18239.18s -> 18240.54s]  I don't care about that.
[18240.54s -> 18241.50s]  Just tell me what to do.
[18242.22s -> 18246.15s]  What time is it?
[18246.15s -> 18247.51s]  All right, I'll do...
[18248.07s -> 18248.95s]  I'll do one more.
[18248.95s -> 18249.59s]  We'll do...
[18249.59s -> 18250.47s]  I'll be the boss.
[18250.47s -> 18251.59s]  We'll do the next two missions.
[18252.31s -> 18256.63s]  Don't engage members of the cult.
[18258.15s -> 18258.87s]  What are you talking about?
[18258.87s -> 18259.51s]  Don't engage.
[18260.39s -> 18278.04s]  Don't engage them.
[18294.65s -> 18294.97s]  Okay.
[18296.01s -> 18301.74s]  Well, they can't take my lightning powers away from me.
[18311.24s -> 18313.08s]  Ah, feisty.
[18313.08s -> 18315.48s]  Well, I got caught so I could get inside without a problem.
[18315.48s -> 18315.96s]  Okay, I get it.
[18315.96s -> 18317.96s]  I have a proposition for you.
[18317.96s -> 18324.84s]  You see, it can get dreadfully dull around here, so I'm up for a bit of sport.
[18324.84s -> 18326.44s]  I'm going to let you out.
[18327.08s -> 18330.60s]  If you can make it back to your ship, you're free to leave.
[18331.56s -> 18335.80s]  But if I catch you, I'll have to shoot you.
[18336.70s -> 18339.50s]  After all, you are an escaped prisoner.
[18340.38s -> 18345.98s]  Hopefully, you'll prove more of a challenge than a bounty hunter I had to kill a few days ago.
[18346.78s -> 18351.18s]  Of course, I've never hunted a Jedi before.
[18351.18s -> 18353.50s]  And if I refuse to play along?
[18353.50s -> 18356.22s]  Well, then you can rot in your cell.
[18356.22s -> 18358.78s]  I'm sure someone might come looking for you.
[18359.50s -> 18360.46s]  Eventually.
[18361.50s -> 18363.48s]  Okay, Jedi.
[18363.48s -> 18365.08s]  The games begin.
[18366.44s -> 18371.59s]  Okay, let me out.
[18371.59s -> 18372.39s]  He's going to let me out.
[18375.58s -> 18376.54s]  Are there other people in the cells?
[18376.54s -> 18377.34s]  Can I let them out, too?
[18383.86s -> 18384.90s]  He gave me a weapon, too.
[18385.62s -> 18386.74s]  I don't even need it.
[18386.74s -> 18390.41s]  I got out.
[18390.41s -> 18397.98s]  Oh, I don't have a lightsaber.
[18400.95s -> 18405.85s]  The guy didn't even have a chance to load his gun.
[18423.88s -> 18427.96s]  Okay.
[18427.96s -> 18428.84s]  Oh, third person.
[18430.62s -> 18431.02s]  Helpful.
[18436.36s -> 18437.48s]  Holy shit, that was awesome.
[18438.20s -> 18439.64s]  That guy just got hit by his...
[18439.64s -> 18440.28s]  That was awesome.
[18440.28s -> 18440.76s]  I loved it.
[18441.48s -> 18442.60s]  Absolutely loved it.
[18443.24s -> 18452.36s]  This thing shoots fast.
[18452.36s -> 18460.07s]  Which door?
[18460.87s -> 18461.59s]  Well, this one.
[18462.23s -> 18463.62s]  That's the one.
[18475.69s -> 18475.93s]  P.
[18481.21s -> 18482.89s]  Open the doors for all the cells.
[18482.89s -> 18483.93s]  Let all the prisoners out.
[18483.93s -> 18485.21s]  Let them come out.
[18485.21s -> 18488.25s]  I need to pause.
[18488.25s -> 18488.73s]  I need to pee.
[18490.41s -> 18491.05s]  I can't pause.
[18496.18s -> 18497.30s]  Trying to do the next mission or two.
[18512.33s -> 18512.97s]  Firehose.
[18522.89s -> 18523.61s]  All right, let's go.
[18524.25s -> 18530.17s]  I'll let you take care of the lockdown.
[18530.17s -> 18531.29s]  Now, where's the hangar?
[18532.44s -> 18533.08s]  I'm crying.
[18533.08s -> 18534.04s]  Please give us a pause.
[18535.48s -> 18536.28s]  We'll pause after this.
[18537.16s -> 18538.70s]  Oh shit, hold on.
[18539.42s -> 18541.18s]  Pause.
[18541.18s -> 18542.22s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[18542.22s -> 18542.94s]  You want to take a break?
[18544.33s -> 18544.65s]  All right.
[18544.89s -> 18545.29s]  Break time.
[18546.09s -> 18546.73s]  Last break.
[18546.73s -> 18547.93s]  We'll do this mission and the one after,
[18547.93s -> 18548.89s]  and then I'm going to call it a night.
[18549.70s -> 18550.18s]  Be right back.
[18693.19s -> 18693.91s]  All right, I'm back.
[18695.72s -> 18696.44s]  Get back to it.
[18704.71s -> 18707.11s]  And it was just going in this door.
[18707.11s -> 18710.87s]  Okay, thank God I fat fingered right
[18710.87s -> 18712.31s]  in the exact same spot I just was.
[18713.11s -> 18722.87s]  Where should I go?
[18745.29s -> 18752.10s]  Where did this guy come from?
[18752.10s -> 18752.34s]  What?
[18753.99s -> 18755.11s]  Jerry voice?
[18755.11s -> 18755.99s]  Jerry.
[18755.99s -> 18757.26s]  I'm Jerry.
[18758.06s -> 18759.02s]  It actually kind of is.
[18759.90s -> 18761.58s]  That's stupid.
[18767.96s -> 18768.36s]  Jerry.
[18775.75s -> 18776.55s]  Oh, Jerry.
[18777.27s -> 18791.59s]  Where am I going?
[18791.59s -> 18807.56s]  Every door is the same door.
[18807.56s -> 18810.23s]  Gain access to the docking bay.
[18811.67s -> 18812.31s]  What?
[18812.31s -> 18825.59s]  Too many fucking doors opening.
[18826.23s -> 18829.03s]  Use the force.
[18829.03s -> 18832.44s]  Yes, I will.
[18832.44s -> 18834.02s]  I promise I'll use the force.
[18835.30s -> 18838.89s]  Like a shotgun.
[18839.45s -> 18844.33s]  This way.
[18846.26s -> 18849.98s]  Um, man, I wish I had a map.
[18849.98s -> 18854.36s]  Is this it?
[18866.55s -> 18874.07s]  Is this it?
[18874.07s -> 18876.82s]  Is this it?
[18878.52s -> 18879.96s]  No, this is the very beginning.
[18882.42s -> 18883.78s]  Oh, God damn it.
[18883.78s -> 18885.38s]  This is the beginning of the game.
[18898.86s -> 18899.66s]  All these hallways.
[18899.66s -> 18909.70s]  There's like 50 doors in here.
[18909.70s -> 18910.18s]  Too many.
[18910.18s -> 18914.07s]  There's too many doors.
[18914.07s -> 18914.71s]  Too many doors.
[18914.71s -> 18921.70s]  Too many elevators.
[18921.70s -> 18922.66s]  They got too many elevators.
[18922.66s -> 18923.54s]  Too many doors and too many rooms
[18923.54s -> 18924.18s]  that lead to nowhere.
[18925.56s -> 18927.08s]  A door and then to go to another door.
[18928.20s -> 18929.32s]  I don't even know what this is.
[18930.20s -> 18945.29s]  What does that do?
[18945.77s -> 18950.86s]  I bet he wasn't expecting that.
[18954.92s -> 18955.72s]  I had to do that?
[18956.62s -> 18957.10s]  Oh, boy.
[18973.96s -> 18979.90s]  I just took down an AT-ST by myself.
[18979.90s -> 18980.86s]  And a guy's gonna come out of the
[18980.86s -> 18981.98s]  the guy's gonna come out of the roof.
[18982.54s -> 18983.66s]  And I'm gonna headshot him.
[18983.66s -> 18994.97s]  Oh, well.
[18994.97s -> 19001.93s]  What do I do now?
[19001.93s -> 19010.71s]  What was that?
[19010.71s -> 19012.70s]  I could hit one.
[19012.70s -> 19016.06s]  The Jedi.
[19016.06s -> 19033.32s]  I'll be...
[19038.94s -> 19040.30s]  I singed my eyebrows.
[19040.30s -> 19040.78s]  Wait.
[19040.78s -> 19042.22s]  This door is opened elsewhere.
[19042.22s -> 19042.86s]  Shit.
[19042.86s -> 19043.18s]  Hold on.
[19043.18s -> 19044.46s]  Did I just kill the guy through the wall
[19044.46s -> 19046.46s]  and now he has to open the door?
[19046.46s -> 19049.86s]  Uh-oh.
[19049.86s -> 19050.26s]  Wait.
[19050.26s -> 19057.30s]  Open up that one.
[19057.86s -> 19060.76s]  No, I'm not Zoft locked.
[19071.94s -> 19073.22s]  Door to get to a door.
[19073.22s -> 19073.72s]  Yep.
[19078.95s -> 19088.38s]  Oh, there he is.
[19091.19s -> 19092.63s]  This Doom guy.
[19092.63s -> 19093.83s]  15, 20 years later.
[19109.96s -> 19110.68s]  What the fuck?
[19111.88s -> 19123.78s]  I'm gonna get in the fucking AT-ST.
[19123.78s -> 19124.58s]  I can't...
[19124.58s -> 19125.86s]  You can't get in an AT-ST.
[19132.87s -> 19133.51s]  Yes, you can.
[19133.51s -> 19134.07s]  Yes, you can.
[19134.07s -> 19134.71s]  Yes, you can.
[19134.71s -> 19135.35s]  Yes, you can.
[19135.35s -> 19135.99s]  Yes, you can.
[19135.99s -> 19136.79s]  Yes, you can.
[19136.79s -> 19137.51s]  That's too late.
[19138.15s -> 19140.02s]  I don't need an AT-ST.
[19140.02s -> 19140.50s]  I have me.
[19141.54s -> 19143.14s]  And I have powerful, powerful...
[19143.14s -> 19143.78s]  I'm gonna sneeze.
[19150.86s -> 19152.06s]  I couldn't mute.
[19152.06s -> 19152.94s]  I tried so hard.
[19153.58s -> 19156.41s]  I fucking...
[19157.45s -> 19158.09s]  I couldn't do it.
[19160.79s -> 19161.59s]  I'm so sorry.
[19163.27s -> 19164.31s]  I can't do it.
[19164.31s -> 19164.79s]  I lied.
[19164.79s -> 19165.67s]  I tried to capture it.
[19166.23s -> 19166.71s]  I lied.
[19166.71s -> 19167.59s]  I'm a liar.
[19167.59s -> 19168.23s]  I'm lying.
[19168.23s -> 19168.71s]  I lied.
[19168.71s -> 19169.91s]  I tried to capture it and I got it.
[19180.47s -> 19182.07s]  It sounds like a dog sneeze.
[19183.27s -> 19185.35s]  It's a dog sneeze.
[19185.35s -> 19194.20s]  It's not like a dog sneeze.
[19194.20s -> 19195.24s]  Where is this saved?
[19196.46s -> 19196.94s]  I don't know.
[19205.45s -> 19205.69s]  No.
[19206.49s -> 19208.09s]  Ah, nice, Ron.
[19208.09s -> 19208.81s]  I'm freaking out.
[19208.81s -> 19209.53s]  I'm losing my mind.
[19213.91s -> 19214.31s]  Okay.
[19214.31s -> 19215.27s]  Hold on, please.
[19215.51s -> 19216.23s]  Just give me a minute, guys.
[19216.23s -> 19217.51s]  I promise I won't do this ever again.
[19218.39s -> 19220.39s]  I promise I won't do this ever again.
[19220.39s -> 19220.95s]  Okay?
[19220.95s -> 19222.79s]  Just let me do one thing and I'll never do it again.
[19225.72s -> 19226.68s]  Nice, Ron.
[19229.62s -> 19230.50s]  Why sneeze?
[19230.50s -> 19231.70s]  I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[19232.89s -> 19233.21s]  Okay.
[19233.21s -> 19234.57s]  I'm so sorry, everybody.
[19234.57s -> 19235.77s]  I don't know if you're probably gonna be like,
[19235.77s -> 19236.81s]  I'm fucking out of here or whatever.
[19239.26s -> 19240.54s]  Nice, Ron.
[19240.54s -> 19241.42s]  Why sneeze?
[19241.42s -> 19242.62s]  I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[19243.34s -> 19244.38s]  Nice, Ron.
[19244.38s -> 19245.26s]  Why sneeze?
[19245.26s -> 19246.62s]  I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[19246.62s -> 19247.98s]  Nice, Ron.
[19247.98s -> 19248.78s]  Nice, Ron.
[19248.78s -> 19249.58s]  Why sneeze?
[19249.58s -> 19250.94s]  I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[19250.94s -> 19251.34s]  Done.
[19251.34s -> 19251.98s]  I'll never do it again.
[19251.98s -> 19252.62s]  I promise.
[19252.62s -> 19254.78s]  I promise you'll never hear me do that ever again.
[19254.78s -> 19257.29s]  I will never do that again.
[19257.29s -> 19257.61s]  Ever.
[19262.81s -> 19263.45s]  Ever.
[19263.45s -> 19264.73s]  You'll never hear me do that again.
[19265.45s -> 19273.16s]  You better not.
[19273.16s -> 19274.81s]  I promise I won't.
[19274.81s -> 19275.53s]  You can trust me.
[19275.53s -> 19276.57s]  I will never do that again.
[19298.36s -> 19300.63s]  What are you doing?
[19304.84s -> 19305.40s]  Where is he?
[19306.04s -> 19307.85s]  Where's the guy that owns this place?
[19308.97s -> 19328.06s]  This looks like a boss fight.
[19328.70s -> 19336.79s]  It is.
[19370.49s -> 19374.41s]  Just let me get up there and I can just shock him.
[19377.48s -> 19379.00s]  Just a shocker.
[19379.00s -> 19382.89s]  A shocker.
[19385.90s -> 19386.54s]  Where is he?
[19386.54s -> 19395.13s]  He's got to get up there and just get him once or twice.
[19395.69s -> 19401.34s]  Is he on?
[19401.34s -> 19402.57s]  Where is he?
[19402.57s -> 19404.62s]  Where is he?
[19404.62s -> 19405.34s]  I don't know where he is.
[19405.90s -> 19407.46s]  Oh, he's up there.
[19407.46s -> 19408.26s]  Okay.
[19408.26s -> 19415.78s]  Where'd you get that weapon?
[19416.26s -> 19427.54s]  God damn it, man.
[19428.90s -> 19438.18s]  I got him.
[19438.18s -> 19438.74s]  I hit him once.
[19452.54s -> 19453.50s]  Whoa.
[19453.50s -> 19466.49s]  He's gonna fall off.
[19466.49s -> 19467.53s]  What the fuck?
[19467.53s -> 19471.54s]  The whole screen shakes.
[19471.54s -> 19497.48s]  Oh my.
[19497.48s -> 19497.88s]  Whoa.
[19497.88s -> 19498.44s]  Easy, easy.
[19498.44s -> 19499.00s]  Don't kill me.
[19510.20s -> 19512.23s]  I just stepped on his head.
[19514.42s -> 19517.14s]  Why did that work more effectively than forest lightning?
[19518.42s -> 19523.51s]  Oh my fucking god.
[19525.85s -> 19526.33s]  Shoot him.
[19527.13s -> 19527.37s]  I...
[19549.10s -> 19550.30s]  Nice, Ron.
[19550.30s -> 19554.66s]  I did it again.
[19555.22s -> 19556.26s]  I did it again.
[19557.85s -> 19559.13s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[19559.13s -> 19559.69s]  It doesn't count.
[19559.69s -> 19560.49s]  That doesn't count.
[19560.49s -> 19560.97s]  That doesn't count.
[19561.77s -> 19562.41s]  It doesn't count.
[19562.41s -> 19562.81s]  That's...
[19562.81s -> 19563.45s]  It doesn't count.
[19563.45s -> 19564.25s]  I had to do the...
[19564.25s -> 19564.75s]  What?
[19567.96s -> 19570.52s]  That doesn't include the sneeze and the...
[19577.21s -> 19577.71s]  Got him.
[19595.58s -> 19596.62s]  No, let's go to the...
[19596.62s -> 19597.12s]  Fuck this.
[19602.86s -> 19604.97s]  You sense anger in me?
[19607.62s -> 19608.50s]  Better be careful.
[19652.50s -> 19654.26s]  Isn't that just a big dead rock?
[19654.26s -> 19657.78s]  It also happens to be the location of one of my father's strongholds.
[19657.78s -> 19662.87s]  You don't add a billion to the debt because I said nice brick.
[19682.71s -> 19683.27s]  Alright.
[19683.27s -> 19685.10s]  Time to be careful.
[19690.86s -> 19691.66s]  F.E. Forces.
[19694.73s -> 19706.55s]  Darth Vader in this game?
[19706.55s -> 19707.19s]  Great.
[19707.19s -> 19708.47s]  Looks like somebody's home.
[19709.03s -> 19710.63s]  Luke sure knows how to pick him.
[19710.63s -> 19711.67s]  Darth Vader in this game?
[19711.67s -> 19712.71s]  Darth Vader in this game?
[19715.85s -> 19716.97s]  Testing my compressor.
[19717.61s -> 19722.41s]  It's acid rain?
[19732.25s -> 19733.13s]  Am I saying ooh?
[19745.27s -> 19746.47s]  Nice, dude.
[19746.47s -> 19747.03s]  Nice.
[19747.03s -> 19755.14s]  What's his name, Kyle?
[19755.14s -> 19756.10s]  Nice, Kyle.
[19763.62s -> 19764.12s]  God.
[19764.66s -> 19765.46s]  Oh, God.
[19783.99s -> 19784.79s]  Is he doing that?
[19788.26s -> 19788.76s]  Ooh.
[19790.39s -> 19790.89s]  Ooh.
[19791.19s -> 19791.69s]  Ooh.
[19792.55s -> 19793.05s]  Ah.
[19795.48s -> 19796.12s]  Ah.
[19796.12s -> 19796.62s]  E.
[19796.62s -> 19797.12s]  Ooh.
[19797.12s -> 19798.28s]  What the fuck?
[19798.28s -> 19799.64s]  Oh my God, it's ruined.
[19802.66s -> 19817.55s]  Coming back.
[19833.56s -> 19834.06s]  Let's go.
[19845.62s -> 19854.34s]  Okay, you can't just run in.
[19854.34s -> 19859.90s]  You cannot just run in.
[19881.40s -> 19882.28s]  This level sucks.
[19904.14s -> 19904.70s]  Do something.
[19905.26s -> 19918.34s]  There it is.
[19918.34s -> 19918.90s]  Save it.
[19918.90s -> 19919.40s]  Go.
[19919.70s -> 19937.03s]  None of them are yours.
[19937.03s -> 19940.71s]  They're all mine.
[19942.87s -> 19943.83s]  None of us are free.
[19945.11s -> 19946.15s]  Yeah, men of the night swap.
[19953.56s -> 19954.36s]  I need help down here.
[19954.36s -> 19955.00s]  It's a Jedi.
[19970.57s -> 19971.05s]  Nice job.
[19971.05s -> 19971.45s]  You did it.
[19974.60s -> 19975.64s]  Excellent work.
[19975.64s -> 19980.22s]  If you can get away, nope.
[19980.22s -> 19981.18s]  Nobody left alive.
[19984.78s -> 19985.58s]  I don't know who you guys are.
[19986.38s -> 19987.26s]  No one left alive.
[19989.51s -> 19991.27s]  True way of the Sith.
[19999.21s -> 20020.52s]  Obtained golden arm.
[20020.52s -> 20021.88s]  You're joking, right?
[20022.68s -> 20023.18s]  Okay.
[20025.99s -> 20028.95s]  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[20029.91s -> 20031.42s]  Kill, kill.
[20035.11s -> 20035.61s]  Nice.
[20036.87s -> 20041.85s]  Checkpoint.
[20041.85s -> 20045.62s]  Oh, I thought I could hit by the door.
[20046.34s -> 20057.78s]  I can't wait until Darth Vader shows up.
[20058.34s -> 20060.74s]  Shield recharge machine.
[20060.74s -> 20062.34s]  Oh my God.
[20062.34s -> 20062.90s]  I got it.
[20062.90s -> 20063.46s]  I'm right here.
[20064.26s -> 20076.90s]  Where are they at?
[20079.88s -> 20081.16s]  Two Jedi's walking in.
[20081.80s -> 20084.41s]  This lightsaber is weird.
[20085.13s -> 20087.38s]  It's like thin and blue.
[20087.38s -> 20088.82s]  It's not like a regular lightsaber.
[20089.46s -> 20093.24s]  There's a point in the end.
[20093.80s -> 20103.90s]  Oh shit.
[20103.90s -> 20104.30s]  Look out.
[20104.94s -> 20111.35s]  You're going this way?
[20119.29s -> 20120.17s]  Uh, nope.
[20120.17s -> 20128.46s]  Not being in front of the width of his saber.
[20129.82s -> 20130.78s]  All right.
[20130.78s -> 20141.67s]  Shield booster.
[20143.10s -> 20143.66s]  Oh boy.
[20143.66s -> 20144.14s]  Watch out.
[20144.14s -> 20144.94s]  This is a job for you.
[20145.58s -> 20148.23s]  Can he die?
[20156.22s -> 20156.72s]  Nice.
[20158.38s -> 20159.42s]  God, this reminds me.
[20163.80s -> 20164.36s]  Nice one.
[20165.80s -> 20166.76s]  Nice one, James.
[20167.48s -> 20168.87s]  Whatever they do.
[20169.59s -> 20170.07s]  Oh boy.
[20170.07s -> 20170.47s]  I'm going to die.
[20170.47s -> 20170.87s]  I'm going to die.
[20170.87s -> 20171.27s]  I'm going to die.
[20171.27s -> 20171.59s]  I'm going to die.
[20171.59s -> 20172.07s]  I'm going to die.
[20182.62s -> 20199.51s]  Where'd he go?
[20199.51s -> 20226.78s]  I can't just get in the fucking window.
[20226.78s -> 20241.19s]  Come on.
[20241.19s -> 20242.07s]  Music is...
[20242.07s -> 20243.61s]  Where'd he go?
[20243.61s -> 20244.25s]  Why is he not here?
[20253.00s -> 20253.56s]  He's dead?
[20253.56s -> 20254.12s]  No, he's not.
[20264.09s -> 20265.54s]  Take cover.
[20265.54s -> 20266.34s]  Did I fall?
[20267.06s -> 20268.42s]  Yes, they're expecting us now.
[20269.38s -> 20273.77s]  I have to get to that turbo laser and take out the bomber first.
[20280.65s -> 20281.05s]  Okay.
[20282.01s -> 20282.65s]  All right.
[20283.53s -> 20283.93s]  Oh, what?
[20283.93s -> 20285.05s]  He's not even with me.
[20286.01s -> 20293.32s]  I guess it's time to get the turbo laser.
[20294.28s -> 20297.70s]  Is that a big secret?
[20297.70s -> 20298.34s]  He must be...
[20299.30s -> 20301.14s]  My goodness gracious.
[20301.14s -> 20301.78s]  I almost died.
[20302.66s -> 20307.45s]  Is that the guy had like a launch code or something?
[20307.45s -> 20308.17s]  Here are the codes.
[20324.04s -> 20325.00s]  I'd stay here for a sec.
[20332.50s -> 20334.50s]  Die, die, die, die, die.
[20335.30s -> 20337.45s]  What?
[20337.45s -> 20340.23s]  Where the fuck did you come from?
[20340.79s -> 20348.82s]  Well, I could use your help.
[20348.82s -> 20349.22s]  Let's go.
[20349.86s -> 20359.19s]  I could use your help.
[20361.54s -> 20374.62s]  I got this.
[20374.62s -> 20375.18s]  Don't worry.
[20375.82s -> 20387.03s]  You're dealing with a real Sith Lord, but I'm a good guy.
[20387.03s -> 20387.83s]  Oh, fuck.
[20387.83s -> 20388.87s]  Obi-Wan, Obi-Wan, help me.
[20388.87s -> 20389.37s]  Obi-Wan.
[20390.15s -> 20392.74s]  Obi-Wan, get down here.
[20392.74s -> 20393.38s]  Obi.
[20393.38s -> 20393.88s]  Come on.
[20399.75s -> 20400.47s]  Get him.
[20400.47s -> 20411.32s]  Let's cut his arm off.
[20411.32s -> 20412.20s]  Nice job, man.
[20414.30s -> 20416.06s]  Let's do a high five with our lightsabers.
[20424.98s -> 20431.54s]  You're joking.
[20431.54s -> 20432.26s]  Sliced him.
[20435.78s -> 20436.74s]  Nice one, James.
[20447.05s -> 20447.77s]  I missed two times.
[20447.77s -> 20448.89s]  That means you get to live.
[20448.89s -> 20459.82s]  That's who's behind it all.
[20459.82s -> 20463.08s]  That's the wizard behind the fucking Wizard of Oz.
[20463.08s -> 20468.50s]  He just scared me.
[20468.50s -> 20486.20s]  Don't ever come up behind a Jedi when he's in the middle of a fight.
[20486.20s -> 20486.76s]  Wait here.
[20486.76s -> 20487.96s]  Let me know if I get it open.
[20496.63s -> 20497.83s]  A Jedi.
[20497.83s -> 20501.35s]  Did you change clothes?
[20506.50s -> 20511.26s]  All right.
[20511.26s -> 20512.14s]  Okay.
[20512.14s -> 20512.54s]  All right.
[20513.10s -> 20514.30s]  Guess who can do that too?
[20515.02s -> 20515.98s]  I can do that too.
[20519.99s -> 20521.11s]  You know, choking match.
[20521.91s -> 20523.43s]  Yeah, I'm a Sith too, motherfucker.
[20523.43s -> 20524.39s]  You want to see who's stronger?
[20524.39s -> 20526.15s]  Who can choke each other's fucking neck harder?
[20527.13s -> 20528.33s]  Put the lightsabers down.
[20528.89s -> 20529.93s]  Let's do it our way.
[20530.81s -> 20542.65s]  God, give me your best.
[20543.21s -> 20546.95s]  What the hell was that?
[20547.67s -> 20551.22s]  Oh my fucking god.
[20551.22s -> 20551.86s]  I'm his last save.
[20558.20s -> 20558.68s]  See, okay.
[20558.68s -> 20562.60s]  I just went back in time and just surprised the hell out of him.
[20563.24s -> 20564.55s]  He's just like, what?
[20564.55s -> 20565.35s]  How does he know?
[20566.31s -> 20568.55s]  I time traveled and found him.
[20568.55s -> 20569.80s]  Goodbye.
[20574.26s -> 20578.95s]  All right.
[20578.95s -> 20579.91s]  Where's the turbo blaster?
[20581.70s -> 20582.50s]  Blaster time.
[20584.10s -> 20584.66s]  Get on there.
[20602.30s -> 20603.18s]  I died?
[20603.18s -> 20614.60s]  Let's get to the castle.
[20615.48s -> 20616.12s]  Where's the castle?
[20616.68s -> 20635.80s]  All right.
[20635.80s -> 20636.36s]  Made it.
[20636.36s -> 20645.05s]  Turbo.
[20645.05s -> 20646.01s]  Everything's gonna be turbo.
[20646.57s -> 20647.91s]  There's a turbo blaster.
[20647.91s -> 20648.87s]  There's a turbo lifter.
[20648.87s -> 20649.59s]  There's a turbo.
[20650.73s -> 20651.53s]  Turbo graphics.
[20661.69s -> 20662.17s]  We got...
[20664.17s -> 20666.10s]  What do we got, Obi-Wan?
[20666.90s -> 20669.35s]  Turbo.
[20680.73s -> 20681.53s]  Let's go.
[20681.53s -> 20683.77s]  No one ever said being a Jedi was glamorous.
[20683.77s -> 20684.65s]  Actually, a lot of people did.
[20685.67s -> 20687.67s]  Like a dream of every child.
[20687.67s -> 20690.07s]  Like it's like it's the thing that everybody wants to do.
[20691.46s -> 20692.58s]  It's like being a superhero.
[20693.78s -> 20694.58s]  Everyone loves it.
[20701.51s -> 20705.11s]  In fact, it's one of the most glamorous jobs I think in the galaxy.
[20705.11s -> 20705.91s]  Everybody knows you.
[20705.91s -> 20706.63s]  Everybody respects you.
[20706.63s -> 20707.67s]  Everybody like loves you.
[20707.67s -> 20708.87s]  Who talking about?
[20708.87s -> 20718.46s]  How'd you do that?
[20719.02s -> 20734.79s]  What are you just doing out in the trash?
[20735.91s -> 20747.91s]  Did I do it?
[20747.91s -> 20748.63s]  Is it activating?
[20749.11s -> 20754.09s]  Why is there a huge trash base?
[20754.65s -> 20775.59s]  Holy shit, they all freaked out.
[20776.31s -> 20779.24s]  They freaked out when I put the grenades.
[20787.93s -> 20789.29s]  It puts them into a panic.
[20790.54s -> 20791.10s]  How do you...
[20791.10s -> 20791.98s]  He's in the vent.
[20795.90s -> 20796.54s]  He's looking up.
[20796.54s -> 20797.74s]  He doesn't care about this guy.
[20797.74s -> 20798.94s]  He just gets with the guy in the vent.
[20805.80s -> 20806.52s]  Get up there.
[20808.12s -> 20809.00s]  I can get up there.
[20809.00s -> 20809.40s]  Maybe.
[20809.96s -> 20810.28s]  Maybe.
[20810.28s -> 20811.08s]  I think I can do it.
[20812.89s -> 20813.29s]  Can you?
[20814.78s -> 20815.42s]  Maybe he can.
[20816.98s -> 20817.78s]  Come on, do it.
[20822.38s -> 20823.74s]  He has changed his target.
[20833.66s -> 20834.62s]  Oh, I shot him.
[20837.37s -> 20838.81s]  What is this guy doing up there?
[20839.61s -> 20840.49s]  We got to kill this guy.
[20841.37s -> 20843.05s]  Grenade?
[20843.05s -> 20843.93s]  All right, I'm going to throw up.
[20843.93s -> 20844.33s]  All right.
[20844.33s -> 20845.61s]  He's going to freak the fuck out in here.
[20846.41s -> 20847.45s]  I don't have any more grenades.
[20848.17s -> 20849.32s]  Hold on.
[20855.42s -> 20856.46s]  I wish I had grenades.
[20857.10s -> 20861.45s]  He's literally just spawn camping in here.
[20862.49s -> 20863.85s]  Like you're just camping.
[20863.85s -> 20870.34s]  Can we just leave him up here?
[20871.06s -> 20880.73s]  Got him.
[20887.08s -> 20887.56s]  Nice job.
[20888.28s -> 20891.56s]  Uh, Obi-Wan, Kyle, Kyle, Obi.
[20896.89s -> 20897.45s]  You get up this?
[20914.41s -> 20920.33s]  Um, is that wrong?
[20920.33s -> 20921.05s]  Oh, shit.
[20921.05s -> 20921.53s]  Where do you go?
[20922.09s -> 20930.52s]  I went in a circle.
[20930.52s -> 20940.18s]  Yeah, but what's the correct way to go though?
[20944.89s -> 20945.53s]  All right, where do we go?
[20957.94s -> 20958.34s]  Switch?
[20958.90s -> 20960.90s]  I think this door would open.
[20967.53s -> 20967.77s]  Up.
[20969.69s -> 20970.65s]  I did go up, right?
[20981.86s -> 20982.90s]  I just did this, didn't I?
[20985.26s -> 20986.14s]  I just did this.
[20993.43s -> 20994.95s]  I just did this.
[20994.95s -> 20995.43s]  So what?
[20995.43s -> 20995.67s]  No.
[20998.58s -> 20999.54s]  Then do it again.
[21011.43s -> 21011.67s]  Okay.
[21013.05s -> 21019.83s]  I guess that made no sense.
[21019.83s -> 21022.23s]  John Cena is killed thanks to the 20 community subs, John.
[21033.32s -> 21033.88s]  You break it?
[21035.45s -> 21036.01s]  He broke it.
[21036.65s -> 21037.21s]  We're all dead.
[21052.90s -> 21053.22s]  All right.
[21053.22s -> 21055.69s]  I'll turn the water off.
[21055.69s -> 21057.35s]  I'll be right back.
[21057.35s -> 21061.11s]  Just break everything.
[21061.11s -> 21063.50s]  Just drink it.
[21067.32s -> 21067.88s]  Turn the power.
[21067.88s -> 21069.08s]  Find a way to turn off the power.
[21069.64s -> 21070.44s]  You're going to leave him there?
[21071.08s -> 21075.86s]  That'll do it.
[21106.98s -> 21108.42s]  No cat puke.
[21108.42s -> 21109.14s]  Wow.
[21109.14s -> 21112.10s]  I really blew it.
[21112.10s -> 21113.54s]  It was a cat puke opportunity.
[21113.54s -> 21113.78s]  No.
[21113.78s -> 21115.30s]  Sometimes I just don't feel like doing it, man.
[21116.02s -> 21117.54s]  I don't have to do a cat puke every time.
[21118.34s -> 21126.20s]  I'm not just going to cat puke.
[21127.08s -> 21129.88s]  Do you just shoot lighting?
[21129.88s -> 21131.53s]  Are you learning from me?
[21145.72s -> 21145.96s]  Nice.
[21147.08s -> 21147.56s]  Ow.
[21147.56s -> 21147.88s]  Ow.
[21147.88s -> 21148.20s]  Easy.
[21151.86s -> 21153.22s]  I can't take my lightsaber out.
[21154.34s -> 21157.16s]  What's wrong with the lightsaber?
[21157.88s -> 21159.22s]  Did I break it?
[21159.22s -> 21160.90s]  Why can I not take my lightsaber out?
[21161.46s -> 21165.82s]  The battery is dead.
[21166.70s -> 21167.74s]  Oh my god.
[21173.08s -> 21180.86s]  I can't take it any more, man.
[21180.86s -> 21181.18s]  All right.
[21181.18s -> 21182.14s]  I am done after this.
[21183.99s -> 21185.19s]  I'm absolutely done.
[21195.06s -> 21195.46s]  I don't know.
[21195.46s -> 21197.14s]  But apparently you didn't get killed by it.
[21203.58s -> 21205.10s]  Take the fucking lightsaber out.
[21217.29s -> 21218.09s]  Easy.
[21218.09s -> 21239.85s]  Can't just shoot it?
[21262.10s -> 21262.82s]  Okay.
[21262.82s -> 21265.40s]  I thought I had to like disable it or something.
[21265.96s -> 21276.39s]  Got one.
[21288.52s -> 21289.24s]  Got two.
[21289.24s -> 21296.79s]  Oh, he just sucked him in.
[21297.43s -> 21298.15s]  That was crazy.
[21304.81s -> 21306.15s]  You just die.
[21306.15s -> 21306.55s]  Whatever.
[21307.11s -> 21310.66s]  I have that ability too.
[21310.66s -> 21310.98s]  Cool.
[21311.62s -> 21316.15s]  Maybe we'll see it someday.
[21317.99s -> 21332.36s]  This is a long level, huh?
[21332.92s -> 21336.17s]  This definitely ends in a 2v1.
[21339.38s -> 21339.94s]  Absolutely.
[21341.54s -> 21342.74s]  I can't wait for the 2v1.
[21343.38s -> 21346.07s]  Versus like Darth Sidious.
[21349.70s -> 21350.18s]  2v1?
[21350.90s -> 21356.89s]  I'm only a master of evil, Darth.
[21359.08s -> 21360.84s]  I'm only a master of evil, Darth.
[21363.10s -> 21363.34s]  Okay.
[21363.34s -> 21363.74s]  What are we?
[21371.74s -> 21386.97s]  Run.
[21386.97s -> 21389.80s]  Darth the Grinner.
[21389.80s -> 21390.60s]  Oh no.
[21390.60s -> 21391.88s]  Darth Grinner is on the loose.
[21402.71s -> 21403.51s]  Yo.
[21403.51s -> 21404.90s]  Help me kill.
[21405.62s -> 21407.62s]  Where'd he go?
[21408.18s -> 21412.25s]  He's just laughing.
[21412.25s -> 21412.97s]  Yeah, you're joking.
[21412.97s -> 21413.45s]  You're joking.
[21413.45s -> 21413.77s]  You're joking.
[21413.77s -> 21414.25s]  No, dude.
[21414.25s -> 21414.81s]  I'm not joking.
[21414.81s -> 21415.29s]  Get in here.
[21419.32s -> 21419.96s]  You idiot.
[21423.06s -> 21423.46s]  Whatever.
[21424.10s -> 21434.78s]  How do I destroy this?
[21447.58s -> 21447.82s]  Oh.
[21456.28s -> 21456.92s]  Thanks for the tip.
[21457.48s -> 21458.41s]  Appreciate it.
[21461.86s -> 21463.38s]  Not everything is lightning.
[21464.02s -> 21464.26s]  No.
[21465.14s -> 21466.42s]  Everything is lightning.
[21467.37s -> 21467.77s]  Everything.
[21469.50s -> 21470.46s]  Lightning is everything.
[21492.76s -> 21493.64s]  Wait, hold on.
[21494.60s -> 21496.36s]  Did you hear the splat?
[21496.36s -> 21498.68s]  That was a cartoon splat.
[21499.64s -> 21502.60s]  This is a fake person talking to me with a voice changer or something.
[21502.60s -> 21502.92s]  He...
[21502.92s -> 21504.12s]  That was a splat.
[21526.47s -> 21527.27s]  Imperials.
[21531.40s -> 21532.44s]  Oh no.
[21532.44s -> 21533.40s]  A fight chamber.
[21534.20s -> 21542.49s]  The mouse is coming for you.
[21543.86s -> 21545.06s]  I'm playing a video game.
[21545.06s -> 21546.50s]  I'm not screaming the movie.
[21547.30s -> 21548.17s]  It's okay.
[21548.17s -> 21548.65s]  It's allowed.
[21549.45s -> 21558.49s]  Now what?
[21558.49s -> 21565.51s]  Why do people like this dumb Star Wars shit?
[21565.51s -> 21574.01s]  2v1.
[21574.09s -> 21574.97s]  Wait, I'm the boss.
[21588.78s -> 21589.34s]  You idiot.
[21590.14s -> 21593.13s]  Weedlely and Tweedledum.
[21593.13s -> 21594.33s]  Oh, he almost just killed him.
[21599.42s -> 21602.78s]  No, this is one person controlling two people at the same time
[21602.78s -> 21604.22s]  with a controller and the keyboard.
[21605.02s -> 21606.46s]  Doing pretty well considering.
[21607.18s -> 21622.42s]  Lots of Sith Lords.
[21633.02s -> 21634.30s]  Oh, that's another thing I have to ask.
[21634.86s -> 21636.22s]  Do we have a Jedi Academy?
[21636.22s -> 21636.54s]  Is this...
[21637.42s -> 21639.42s]  I'm seeing a lot of red lightsabers.
[21640.30s -> 21642.86s]  Do they have like a Sith Lord Academy?
[21643.50s -> 21649.46s]  Because there's a lot of these little Sith henchmen.
[21650.02s -> 21650.50s]  Do they?
[21651.38s -> 21660.57s]  Oh shit.
[21660.57s -> 21661.53s]  Okay, that was pretty nice.
[21679.10s -> 21682.82s]  You're not supposed to ask that question.
[21682.82s -> 21683.54s]  Well, I just did.
[21685.74s -> 21686.94s]  Yellow means you're a sentinel?
[21688.20s -> 21688.52s]  Cool.
[21689.16s -> 21699.11s]  Let go.
[21699.11s -> 21706.22s]  He's powering up.
[21706.86s -> 21708.68s]  Are you serious?
[21708.68s -> 21709.88s]  You dishonorable.
[21710.60s -> 21712.92s]  Completely out of the fucking goddamn question
[21712.92s -> 21714.52s]  that you would do something like that.
[21714.52s -> 21715.72s]  Unbelievable.
[21715.72s -> 21716.68s]  Demote this guy.
[21716.68s -> 21717.40s]  Get rid of him.
[21717.40s -> 21718.52s]  You're going to shoot a guy in the back
[21718.52s -> 21723.13s]  in the middle of a 1v1 lightsaber Sith versus Jedi battle.
[21723.13s -> 21724.33s]  Are you proud of yourself?
[21726.76s -> 21727.72s]  No honor at all.
[21728.84s -> 21729.96s]  Oh, yeah, you are.
[21729.96s -> 21730.92s]  Yes, nodding.
[21730.92s -> 21731.64s]  Very good.
[21731.64s -> 21732.28s]  Very good.
[21732.28s -> 21734.60s]  I'm going to torture this motherfucker when I get over there.
[21749.98s -> 21750.48s]  Karen.
[21751.58s -> 21752.78s]  Oh, yes, you are nodding.
[21752.78s -> 21753.82s]  Yeah, go ahead and kill me.
[21755.46s -> 21756.66s]  Well, I'm killing you too.
[21759.64s -> 21760.92s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[21760.92s -> 21761.96s]  Oh my god, let go of me.
[21765.59s -> 21766.71s]  Stop that.
[21766.71s -> 21772.31s]  I'm using the powers of light.
[21772.87s -> 21786.76s]  I will use the powers of light to destroy you.
[21787.64s -> 21811.22s]  100 creeper blocks.
[21811.22s -> 21811.62s]  Be careful.
[21852.47s -> 21853.03s]  Let me go.
[21872.38s -> 21872.86s]  Shock him.
[21872.86s -> 21873.34s]  Shock him.
[21873.34s -> 21873.74s]  Shock him.
[21873.74s -> 21874.14s]  Shock him.
[21874.14s -> 21875.10s]  Shock him.
[21875.10s -> 21877.24s]  Give me that back.
[21885.46s -> 21886.02s]  Through the wall.
[21886.02s -> 21886.90s]  You can do that through the wall.
[21886.90s -> 21887.62s]  No, you can't.
[21887.62s -> 21888.12s]  Lie.
[21893.35s -> 21893.91s]  There it is.
[21893.91s -> 21894.31s]  Got it.
[21894.31s -> 21895.03s]  1v1 duel.
[21895.03s -> 21895.53s]  You're dead.
[21899.59s -> 21900.63s]  Give him the jock jock.
[21900.63s -> 21901.35s]  Shock jock him.
[21908.68s -> 21909.80s]  Oh shit, there's another.
[21910.52s -> 21920.67s]  Bye.
[21920.97s -> 21922.70s]  Where's that Sith Jedi?
[21923.42s -> 21925.75s]  Where'd he go?
[21925.75s -> 21930.40s]  There he is.
[21949.18s -> 21951.58s]  Big mistake letting go of your blade like that.
[21951.58s -> 21952.46s]  What an idiot.
[21952.46s -> 21955.14s]  Completely opening yourself up to an attack.
[21955.70s -> 21964.87s]  Why is chat rioting?
[21964.87s -> 21965.37s]  What do you mean?
[21984.04s -> 21984.92s]  I have to fight two-
[21984.92s -> 21985.64s]  No, I'm leaving.
[21986.44s -> 21991.42s]  Yeah, you come get me.
[21994.30s -> 21995.42s]  Oh shit, this is a bad idea.
[22002.65s -> 22004.25s]  Where is my friend?
[22004.25s -> 22006.65s]  I have to fight three of these guys at the same time?
[22006.65s -> 22007.61s]  This is unfair.
[22009.06s -> 22009.78s]  Really unfair.
[22010.66s -> 22016.47s]  Oh, I can hide over here.
[22028.95s -> 22031.50s]  They have trouble in tight spaces.
[22036.66s -> 22038.50s]  Oh my god, I don't even know what's happening.
[22041.91s -> 22042.41s]  They-
[22042.95s -> 22043.99s]  They're not powerful.
[22043.99s -> 22046.71s]  You don't think I'm fighting four of you guys at the same time?
[22048.44s -> 22052.12s]  And a choker guy and a flying mech suit.
[22052.92s -> 22055.48s]  I think I'm pretty powerful.
[22055.48s -> 22057.16s]  I think I'm very powerful, actually.
[22057.96s -> 22071.53s]  Oh my god, die.
[22081.72s -> 22083.48s]  Holy shit, he's got lightning too.
[22083.48s -> 22083.98s]  Nice.
[22084.52s -> 22085.16s]  Mine's blue.
[22085.16s -> 22086.12s]  That means mine's good.
[22090.70s -> 22091.66s]  Hold on, hold on.
[22091.66s -> 22092.70s]  Wait, get out of here.
[22092.70s -> 22107.40s]  I'm busy right now.
[22121.67s -> 22122.63s]  Jesus, all right.
[22122.63s -> 22123.43s]  So what do you say?
[22123.43s -> 22124.47s]  You're going to catch up to me soon?
[22124.47s -> 22125.03s]  Doing what?
[22125.03s -> 22142.65s]  Where is he?
[22142.65s -> 22148.02s]  He's going to just come in on a giant fucking ship, isn't he?
[22163.94s -> 22166.10s]  This level is way too long, by the way.
[22166.10s -> 22169.21s]  It's like extended level.
[22169.21s -> 22177.42s]  What does he want me to do?
[22180.15s -> 22185.22s]  Back up there?
[22185.22s -> 22186.10s]  Go up?
[22186.10s -> 22203.99s]  Oh, that blends in, but that blends in.
[22203.99s -> 22204.71s]  That blends in.
[22205.27s -> 22210.36s]  I don't even care about that guy.
[22211.00s -> 22212.76s]  I don't even want to fight him.
[22212.76s -> 22213.64s]  Like, I don't care.
[22220.39s -> 22222.47s]  All right, this is the big climax right here.
[22222.87s -> 22228.28s]  This is it.
[22246.17s -> 22248.63s]  What's wrong with my game?
[22249.27s -> 22249.99s]  What's wrong with the game?
[22251.83s -> 22252.63s]  What's wrong with my game?
[22259.14s -> 22260.42s]  It's kind of stretched.
[22265.48s -> 22267.00s]  I got drugged by the droid.
[22267.00s -> 22267.48s]  Oh, okay.
[22277.18s -> 22287.16s]  Get.
[22287.16s -> 22288.60s]  Oh, I hate that.
[22288.60s -> 22291.32s]  I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
[22291.32s -> 22298.18s]  I'm hungry.
[22298.18s -> 22301.37s]  That run.
[22302.01s -> 22303.29s]  Oh, damn it.
[22303.29s -> 22305.37s]  That fucking run freaked me out, man.
[22306.01s -> 22314.23s]  Get that chip.
[22314.23s -> 22318.70s]  I'm for a whopper?
[22318.70s -> 22319.26s]  No, thank you.
[22321.48s -> 22322.92s]  Rather, never mind.
[22323.00s -> 22324.36s]  It's like, those things.
[22324.36s -> 22325.88s]  I hate this stupid fucking shield.
[22350.76s -> 22351.64s]  Eat lead.
[22352.44s -> 22358.02s]  Oh, wait, what?
[22358.02s -> 22359.62s]  They have lightsabers now?
[22360.42s -> 22363.94s]  Since when do they have lightsabers?
[22363.94s -> 22364.90s]  Oh, they did once.
[22379.11s -> 22380.15s]  They fly now?
[22380.71s -> 22382.25s]  What's that from?
[22382.25s -> 22393.03s]  You know, they keep playing the Darth Vader song, but he's not in the game.
[22405.58s -> 22410.84s]  Bye.
[22410.84s -> 22415.14s]  No, no, I don't want to do that right now.
[22419.58s -> 22425.99s]  Oh, it's a double wielding lightsaber foe.
[22439.98s -> 22441.66s]  Oh, I thought I was going to get right in the middle.
[22441.66s -> 22447.06s]  What the fuck is this?
[22447.78s -> 22452.02s]  Is this going to be screaming?
[22454.95s -> 22455.43s]  Okay, run.
[22455.99s -> 22457.38s]  There's a lot of trash.
[22457.38s -> 22458.82s]  Holy shit, you have tons of trash.
[22459.54s -> 22479.13s]  Yeah, try to block all those.
[22488.86s -> 22493.38s]  Oh, what a one-line.
[22493.38s -> 22495.78s]  Here comes Darth Vader.
[22496.74s -> 22502.07s]  Treat it like doom.
[22519.62s -> 22521.14s]  May the force be with you.
[22524.18s -> 22524.68s]  What?
[22529.50s -> 22529.98s]  Oh, what?
[22531.10s -> 22534.90s]  Did they like phone a friend or something?
[22534.90s -> 22538.84s]  How did you come down here?
[22539.64s -> 22540.76s]  Was he supposed to be the whole time?
[22541.56s -> 22545.77s]  Was he supposed to be here the entire time?
[22552.23s -> 22554.23s]  Someone didn't like Vader much.
[22556.04s -> 22561.24s]  Wait, is that Kyle?
[22562.04s -> 22562.92s]  That's not Kyle.
[22563.48s -> 22569.62s]  Somebody just fell off.
[22572.71s -> 22573.51s]  What did he do?
[22575.99s -> 22577.03s]  How did he fall?
[22586.79s -> 22587.19s]  I can't.
[22593.62s -> 22594.98s]  He slipped on something.
[22594.98s -> 22596.98s]  I mean, how?
[22603.99s -> 22604.55s]  I win.
[22606.90s -> 22607.78s]  Guys, did you just hear it?
[22629.45s -> 22658.44s]  All right, I'm going to shoot a fake one.
[22658.44s -> 22659.08s]  Here's the real one.
[22659.96s -> 22679.51s]  Oh, god damn it.
[22679.51s -> 22680.55s]  I'm trying to stick it on the wall.
[22681.43s -> 22682.79s]  This is a fucking mistake.
[22683.51s -> 22692.60s]  All right, now why don't you come over here and get me, you fucking punk.
[22693.16s -> 22696.81s]  Oh, look at this.
[22696.81s -> 22697.53s]  Come and get me.
[22698.33s -> 22713.61s]  Stronger, no.
[22714.65s -> 22715.45s]  Smarter, maybe.
[22720.70s -> 22721.18s]  Pretty good.
[22725.05s -> 22727.29s]  Never take your blade down.
[22727.29s -> 22729.53s]  People always do that and it's the stupidest idea.
[22730.57s -> 22731.53s]  You just look silly.
[22745.40s -> 22746.76s]  How many times are they going to do that?
[22760.65s -> 22762.01s]  The MCA sounds.
[22767.67s -> 22770.79s]  Oh, this one has the Darth Maul.
[22787.43s -> 22789.66s]  Darth Maul-ding.
[22790.62s -> 22794.26s]  What? Did I win?
[22795.93s -> 22796.41s]  Okay, I got him.
[22814.87s -> 22815.43s]  Oh, shit.
[22815.43s -> 22817.45s]  This is like the chancellor, the emperor.
[22828.49s -> 22829.61s]  Yeah, of course he was bad.
[22831.69s -> 22833.21s]  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Underground.
[22839.46s -> 22840.26s]  Darth Rosh.
[22851.21s -> 22853.35s]  Rosh, what are you saying?
[22853.91s -> 22854.87s]  You're a Jedi.
[22857.16s -> 22859.86s]  No, I am.
[22859.86s -> 22860.90s]  Enough talk.
[22861.54s -> 22866.74s]  Rosh, destroy this puny Jedi so we can complete our task.
[22866.74s -> 22868.02s]  Yeah, I think I know what it's like.
[22868.02s -> 22868.50s]  Yes.
[22868.50s -> 22869.70s]  I'm also Darkseid.
[22869.70s -> 22875.61s]  If you're too weak to join us, Jaden, we can't let you stand in our way.
[22876.41s -> 22876.81s]  Red.
[22878.01s -> 22879.61s]  Oh, no, it's red.
[22882.36s -> 22883.64s]  Oh, no, it's red.
[22897.40s -> 22904.95s]  This guy, they're back facing me.
[22910.55s -> 22911.91s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[22955.08s -> 22956.12s]  He's just up there.
[22956.84s -> 22958.62s]  He's gonna fall.
[22958.62s -> 22959.34s]  He's gonna fall.
[22959.34s -> 22960.62s]  He's gonna fall, guys.
[22960.62s -> 22962.86s]  He's gonna fall and we're gonna all laugh at it.
[22962.86s -> 22963.58s]  He's gonna fall.
[22966.39s -> 22967.35s]  Get down from there.
[22967.35s -> 22967.75s]  Come on.
[22970.82s -> 22971.78s]  Come on, fall.
[22972.90s -> 22973.70s]  Fall already.
[22979.59s -> 22980.55s]  He ain't gonna fall.
[22980.55s -> 22981.19s]  Fall already.
[22982.71s -> 22987.16s]  He just fall down already.
[22993.03s -> 22993.83s]  I knew he was coming.
[22993.83s -> 22994.87s]  I knew it was still funny.
[22999.46s -> 23001.43s]  He hit his head on.
[23004.50s -> 23006.42s]  He even laid out for that.
[23006.42s -> 23008.02s]  He didn't even lay out that far.
[23009.14s -> 23011.94s]  At least try to land on your knees and roll, man.
[23011.94s -> 23015.86s]  You just went completely belly flop on your stomach.
[23016.58s -> 23019.58s]  At least give yourself the opportunity.
[23020.30s -> 23022.50s]  You're not like cave in your chest.
[23023.14s -> 23027.02s]  Why is he blue?
[23028.36s -> 23028.84s]  I can't.
[23039.80s -> 23040.68s]  It's a hologram.
[23047.32s -> 23047.80s]  Take this.
[23048.36s -> 23054.06s]  Oh, he's green now.
[23054.06s -> 23056.46s]  That means I have force power.
[23074.09s -> 23074.41s]  Shit.
[23075.72s -> 23077.72s]  Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away.
[23078.68s -> 23079.16s]  Get away.
[23079.16s -> 23080.12s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[23080.12s -> 23081.16s]  Get away, mom.
[23085.43s -> 23090.86s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[23090.86s -> 23092.22s]  Don't let him kill you.
[23092.22s -> 23092.94s]  He's shitty.
[23092.94s -> 23093.50s]  He's horrible.
[23093.50s -> 23095.90s]  He's like the little pretend antagonist.
[23101.77s -> 23102.09s]  All right.
[23117.80s -> 23118.60s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[23138.86s -> 23139.10s]  Fuck.
[23139.10s -> 23140.30s]  I was trying to be dishonorable.
[23148.34s -> 23174.63s]  This guy's fucking running.
[23175.83s -> 23182.42s]  These guys don't even have any.
[23183.06s -> 23191.03s]  Where's rash?
[23191.03s -> 23208.04s]  I'm going to wait until it's 100 and then do it.
[23213.06s -> 23213.78s]  Die for rash.
[23217.69s -> 23221.88s]  All right.
[23221.88s -> 23222.76s]  Back up, back up, back up.
[23222.76s -> 23223.64s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23232.94s -> 23236.54s]  And big head tennis.
[23237.10s -> 23238.68s]  That's what you're looking for.
[23238.68s -> 23240.20s]  You're looking for big head tennis.
[23240.20s -> 23253.98s]  I don't know where it was.
[23256.28s -> 23256.76s]  There it is.
[23257.32s -> 23259.80s]  Do it.
[23259.80s -> 23269.53s]  I would give up my apprentice so easily.
[23269.53s -> 23270.73s]  He's standing there the whole time.
[23270.73s -> 23273.29s]  You should have killed me when you had the chance, Katarn.
[23273.85s -> 23276.49s]  Your pathetic Jedi mercy is a weakness
[23276.49s -> 23278.33s]  that shall cost you your life
[23279.13s -> 23281.85s]  and the life of your academy's students.
[23283.74s -> 23286.14s]  But not you, my dear rash.
[23287.02s -> 23288.42s]  Come.
[23288.42s -> 23289.94s]  Yes, Tavian.
[23289.94s -> 23290.58s]  Rash, no.
[23292.02s -> 23299.29s]  Friendship cannot compare with the power of the dark side.
[23299.29s -> 23300.25s]  I know.
[23300.25s -> 23302.49s]  I'm incredibly strong in the dark side.
[23302.49s -> 23306.33s]  Stealing scraps of the force like some sort of intergalactic parasite.
[23306.33s -> 23309.37s]  Spare me your self-righteous pity, Katarn.
[23309.37s -> 23311.93s]  You may have shamed me when you spared my life.
[23311.93s -> 23314.57s]  I got much better lightning hands than anybody in this room.
[23314.57s -> 23315.45s]  Please.
[23315.45s -> 23318.25s]  Now, master.
[23318.25s -> 23324.01s]  One who has promised me that destroyed the Jedi.
[23324.01s -> 23327.21s]  Ragnos, what can a dead Sith Lord give you?
[23327.85s -> 23330.41s]  Everything I have ever wanted.
[23331.53s -> 23333.66s]  Not that I'm to see.
[23335.64s -> 23336.14s]  What?
[23336.68s -> 23340.26s]  It's quite the drop.
[23340.26s -> 23341.30s]  It's quite the fumble.
[23341.78s -> 23349.18s]  I can't keep this up for long.
[23349.18s -> 23349.68s]  Hold on.
[23350.46s -> 23357.24s]  I don't even know what just happened.
[23358.84s -> 23362.26s]  We looked everywhere after getting free.
[23362.26s -> 23364.98s]  But Tavian had already taken Rosh and fled.
[23364.98s -> 23365.48s]  Sitting.
[23365.48s -> 23367.38s]  So now we know who was leading this cult.
[23367.38s -> 23370.58s]  But that doesn't explain why there are so many dark force users.
[23370.58s -> 23372.18s]  Some of Desan's left over re-
[23372.18s -> 23373.78s]  A lot wrong with what just happened there, I think.
[23373.78s -> 23376.34s]  As for the cultists, Jaden has a theory.
[23376.34s -> 23380.02s]  If the scepter can store the force, maybe it can release it too.
[23380.82s -> 23384.02s]  Tavian could be using it to empower her followers.
[23384.02s -> 23386.82s]  Corrupting disciples with the dark side of the force?
[23387.38s -> 23388.58s]  That would explain a lot.
[23389.22s -> 23390.90s]  Did you get a good look at the scepter?
[23390.90s -> 23391.62s]  Yeah.
[23391.62s -> 23393.70s]  I bet it belonged to Ragnos.
[23393.70s -> 23396.58s]  We need to figure out what Tavian plans on doing with it.
[23396.58s -> 23397.94s]  If we're going to stop her.
[23397.94s -> 23398.44s]  Agreed.
[23399.48s -> 23402.44s]  You are going to need to build a new lightsaber to replace the one you lost.
[23402.44s -> 23402.94s]  Oh!
[23403.56s -> 23405.80s]  Try to figure out what Tavian's next move is.
[23408.95s -> 23409.75s]  Sir?
[23409.75s -> 23410.47s]  Jaden.
[23410.47s -> 23413.19s]  You handled yourself exceptionally well on Vajun.
[23413.19s -> 23417.11s]  To confront three dark Jedi and defeat them took bravery and skill.
[23417.75s -> 23418.62s]  Efforts?
[23419.08s -> 23422.04s]  I feel you are ready to join our ranks as a Jedi Knight.
[23422.04s -> 23422.54s]  Oh me?
[23422.54s -> 23423.32s]  Congratulations.
[23423.32s -> 23424.68s]  Yes, Master Skywalker.
[23425.40s -> 23426.20s]  Thank you both.
[23429.75s -> 23430.25s]  Jaden.
[23430.25s -> 23431.59s]  When do I get fired?
[23431.59s -> 23434.07s]  I felt the anger seething inside you.
[23434.07s -> 23439.26s]  You may be a Jedi Knight now, but you still must beware of the dark side.
[23439.26s -> 23440.30s]  Yes, Kyle.
[23440.30s -> 23441.58s]  I'll try not to fail you.
[23442.06s -> 23446.79s]  I'll try.
[23447.51s -> 23448.63s]  Oh, yep.
[23449.75s -> 23450.71s]  Dual sabers.
[23451.67s -> 23452.95s]  Two-handed saber.
[23455.90s -> 23456.94s]  Oh, what would I have?
[23457.98s -> 23465.50s]  I would have one big orange dual saber.
[23474.78s -> 23475.28s]  Or...
[23477.70s -> 23479.06s]  German 985 build.
[23479.78s -> 23488.41s]  Why can't I have three?
[23488.41s -> 23503.32s]  The Joker?
[23504.12s -> 23505.16s]  What do you mean the Joker?
[23506.74s -> 23507.54s]  Oh, that's...
[23507.54s -> 23508.98s]  Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?
[23509.54s -> 23514.38s]  It is the Joker.
[23515.34s -> 23529.18s]  I'm going big orange that one.
[23545.53s -> 23549.21s]  Okay, I'm done.
[23549.21s -> 23550.65s]  But I just want to see what it looks like.
[23554.33s -> 23561.32s]  These are all level three already.
[23563.50s -> 23564.14s]  Force drain.
[23564.94s -> 23573.62s]  Drain life essence.
[23574.18s -> 23581.86s]  All right, I just want to see what it is.
[23581.86s -> 23582.66s]  I'm not playing this mission.
[23582.66s -> 23583.16s]  I just want to see.
[23587.32s -> 23588.84s]  Please don't ever stream again.
[23588.84s -> 23589.80s]  Well, I am.
[23589.80s -> 23590.30s]  I'm sorry.
[23591.39s -> 23592.03s]  Disappoint you.
[23593.63s -> 23594.27s]  Yeah, I'm done.
[23596.24s -> 23597.28s]  I will be back.
[23597.28s -> 23598.48s]  I'll see you guys on...
[23601.15s -> 23603.07s]  I'll see you guys on Saturday afternoon.
[23603.71s -> 23611.85s]  Oh, there it is.
[23611.85s -> 23618.83s]  It's one of those big demons, right?
[23630.48s -> 23635.39s]  I just want to swing it around for a second
[23635.39s -> 23636.11s]  and then end the stream.
[23636.75s -> 23638.64s]  Yeah, thanks for watching, everybody.
[23640.08s -> 23641.36s]  You can eat him or not?
[23641.36s -> 23642.16s]  Okay, really?
[23642.16s -> 23643.92s]  That was a lot of build-up, I was going to say.
[23644.80s -> 23645.36s]  Get on with it.
[23656.32s -> 23657.76s]  You care about me?
[23663.71s -> 23664.59s]  Who's the intruder?
[23664.91s -> 23666.11s]  There's a rancor over here.
[23666.11s -> 23666.83s]  What are you doing?
[23672.56s -> 23673.60s]  Look, I know we're enemies,
[23673.60s -> 23674.64s]  but there's something...
[23674.64s -> 23675.20s]  Look.
[23675.20s -> 23675.84s]  Look what's over here.
[23693.08s -> 23695.72s]  He goes up and just starts punching.
[23695.72s -> 23696.44s]  Did you see that?
[23696.44s -> 23698.04s]  He was like, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.
[23702.48s -> 23702.88s]  Hold on.
[23702.88s -> 23703.36s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23703.36s -> 23704.96s]  Wait, I got this guy right here.
[23704.96s -> 23705.84s]  This could be...
[23705.84s -> 23706.40s]  I want to see.
[23707.36s -> 23709.12s]  There's an opportunity for him to break through here
[23709.12s -> 23710.56s]  and fight this guy, maybe?
[23711.52s -> 23723.80s]  Okay, let's see what happens.
[23723.80s -> 23727.02s]  Dad, why is he coming after me?
[23728.06s -> 23728.56s]  Really?
[23729.10s -> 23733.80s]  I was dead a long time ago, dude.
[23734.52s -> 23735.77s]  Please, eat me.
[23735.77s -> 23736.65s]  Just eat me.
[23736.65s -> 23737.37s]  He's thinking about you.
[23737.37s -> 23738.65s]  Mmm, this is...
[23738.65s -> 23740.01s]  This medicine is delicious.
[23740.01s -> 23740.73s]  Let me try it.
[23741.29s -> 23741.79s]  Mmm.
[23743.36s -> 23743.86s]  No!
[23744.48s -> 23745.28s]  It's too sour.
[23745.92s -> 23751.84s]  All right, I'm done.
[23756.51s -> 23758.51s]  I will see you guys on Saturday.
[23759.07s -> 23760.80s]  I'm not sure what we're going to do on Saturday,
[23761.44s -> 23762.52s]  but we'll see.
[23763.32s -> 23768.11s]  I mean, we could...
[23768.11s -> 23768.91s]  I could finish this,
[23770.38s -> 23772.38s]  but how much more time do I really have in this game?
[23773.18s -> 23777.07s]  What's the...
[23777.07s -> 23778.75s]  Anybody know how much time is left?
[23778.75s -> 23781.90s]  Like two or three hours?
[23781.90s -> 23782.78s]  Is it just this,
[23782.78s -> 23784.06s]  or is there another section after this?
[23784.70s -> 23794.16s]  This is the last section?
[23794.16s -> 23794.72s]  Okay.
[23794.72s -> 23795.60s]  Yeah, here's what we'll do.
[23796.72s -> 23797.92s]  On Saturday, we're going to finish this,
[23798.56s -> 23801.42s]  because I'm not going to be a never-finished-games Andy,
[23802.14s -> 23802.86s]  right?
[23802.86s -> 23805.53s]  Because this is fun and funny.
[23805.53s -> 23807.37s]  So we're going to finish this game,
[23808.49s -> 23810.09s]  and then we'll pivot to something else
[23810.09s -> 23810.89s]  for a couple hours, too,
[23811.61s -> 23812.49s]  depending on how long it takes.
[23814.44s -> 23815.80s]  I will see you guys on Saturday.
[23815.80s -> 23816.76s]  Thanks for watching, everybody.
[23817.40s -> 23818.48s]  We'll see you soon.
[23819.20s -> 23822.48s]  This has been Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy,
[23823.28s -> 23825.76s]  and we'll see you Saturday.
[23826.16s -> 23832.88s]  Here come the subs that came in today.
[23832.88s -> 23834.19s]  Thanks, everybody.
[23834.19s -> 23834.75s]  Kind of long.
[23835.95s -> 23839.23s]  Longer than recently, usual, you know,
[23839.23s -> 23841.00s]  but I was having fun.
[23841.00s -> 23846.78s]  Hope you have a good start to your weekend.
[23846.78s -> 23853.42s]  We'll see you soon.
[23856.30s -> 23856.94s]  Let's do a raid.
[23856.94s -> 23857.74s]  Yeah, let's raid somebody.
[23859.02s -> 23860.94s]  Who do we got streaming right now?
[23860.94s -> 23861.44s]  Let's see.
[23865.93s -> 23867.93s]  Quite a few people are streaming right now.
[23870.30s -> 23871.58s]  Quite a few people.
[23882.70s -> 23883.98s]  I'm going to dump you on Italics.
[23883.98s -> 23885.58s]  Italics is playing Cooking Simulator,
[23886.14s -> 23887.66s]  and I mean, that game is just fun.
[23887.66s -> 23888.94s]  I'm not sure he's ever played it before.
[23888.94s -> 23893.36s]  Maybe go say hello to Italics.
[23893.36s -> 23894.40s]  Cooking Simulator.
[23898.91s -> 23900.27s]  I will see you guys on Saturday.
[23900.27s -> 23900.99s]  Good night.
[23902.17s -> 23902.33s]  Bye.
[23902.33s -> 23903.29s]  Thank you again.
[23903.29s -> 23909.28s]  Feels bad ignoring Link.
[23909.28s -> 23910.16s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23910.16s -> 23910.56s]  Which one?
[23911.93s -> 23912.89s]  Ah-ee-oo.
[23913.69s -> 23914.49s]  Ah-ee-oo.
[23915.13s -> 23917.42s]  Is this a huge ass?
[23918.46s -> 23919.74s]  Okay, this is funny.
[23921.93s -> 23923.29s]  All right, I'll allow this.
[23923.29s -> 23924.33s]  This is funny.
[23924.33s -> 23933.04s]  This one can slip through because I like it.
[23933.04s -> 23933.60s]  It's funny.
[23934.16s -> 23939.90s]  That's wrong.
[23942.67s -> 23944.84s]  Wrong Link is another one.
[23946.68s -> 23948.76s]  Press A for ah, E for e.
[23952.19s -> 23953.47s]  S for sneeze.
[23958.27s -> 23958.99s]  Audio jungle.
[23961.95s -> 23963.31s]  How did you make this website?
[23972.75s -> 23973.55s]  Nice rhyme.
[23976.03s -> 23977.95s]  I just did it, but I was just showing you that I have that too.
[23978.67s -> 23981.63s]  Hold them down?
[23982.27s -> 23983.66s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[23983.66s -> 23990.80s]  What do you mean hold them down?
[23997.00s -> 23997.56s]  No, that doesn't...
[23997.56s -> 23999.16s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23999.16s -> 24000.04s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[24000.04s -> 24000.92s]  That's not fair.
[24001.56s -> 24002.20s]  That's not fair.
[24005.31s -> 24006.19s]  Okay, I'm not doing that again.
[24006.19s -> 24007.39s]  Audio jungle.
[24007.39s -> 24008.19s]  Yeah, done.
[24008.19s -> 24008.67s]  That was fun.
[24009.40s -> 24010.28s]  All right, good night.
[24010.28s -> 24012.20s]  I just blocked the rest of the credits with this shit.
[24012.20s -> 24012.76s]  Oh my god.
[24012.76s -> 24013.40s]  All right.
[24013.40s -> 24014.20s]  I'll see you guys Saturday.
[24014.20s -> 24015.24s]  Have a great night.
[24015.24s -> 24016.76s]  Go say hello to Italics.
[24016.76s -> 24019.47s]  Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[24019.47s -> 24020.67s]  I will see you guys on Saturday.
[24020.67s -> 24021.23s]  Good night.
