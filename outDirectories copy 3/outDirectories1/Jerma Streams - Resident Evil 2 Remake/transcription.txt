[1.72s -> 12.82s]  Good afternoon. Welcome to class. I'm your teacher, Sternma. I'm Stern today.
[12.82s -> 28.09s]  I got bubblegum, get the fuck out of here. I can smell it. Hi guys. Uh-oh, internet. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[28.09s -> 40.18s]  Kind of going with the theme here. Starting streams and having them have cox problems.
[40.18s -> 51.17s]  But, Resident Evil 2 tonight. Looking forward to it a lot. I played the original a long time ago.
[51.17s -> 58.16s]  And fucking, are we going to turn off? Is this stream going to stay connected to the internet?
[58.16s -> 72.74s]  Well, I'm not even going to tweet this out yet. This is, they're just playing with me here. It's not actually going to happen.
[72.74s -> 88.08s]  I've been looking forward to it. Germa Pluto. Yeah, you moved to avoid this? Well, here's the problem. I live in North America.
[88.08s -> 108.93s]  It's a problem everywhere, unfortunately. I think it's going to be fine.
[108.93s -> 114.93s]  I'm going to do a prediction here in about five minutes. It's like it's not even, it's like it never happened.
[114.93s -> 128.74s]  Just take a balloon to Europe. You know, I might as well. All right, quick. What's the best state in Europe?
[128.74s -> 150.06s]  Somebody said Norway? Norway. I've seen a lot of Norways. London? But isn't that not even?
[150.06s -> 163.68s]  All right, give me a second. I'm going to go just, I'm not going anywhere. I'm actually, I'm just going to like sit here like this.
[163.68s -> 170.68s]  Let's turn the camera on just to as well. All right. But hold on. Let me make sure that this note like I'm not like naked in this one.
[170.68s -> 210.32s]  OK, I should be clothed. I am. OK, well, hi everybody. Welcome to the spring.
[210.32s -> 217.56s]  This is this is the portion of the stream where we sometimes just have to wait until I'm allowed to have my internet work.
[217.56s -> 228.56s]  And how was your Monday? I was pretty good. My hair slicked back with oil and I went like this.
[228.56s -> 237.57s]  I just stuck my hands into like jelly. I just went like this and I smeared it back over my fucking head.
[237.57s -> 242.94s]  I had to look OK today because the face cam might come on at random jump scare moments.
[242.94s -> 272.74s]  Two thousand drop frames. Don't do it to us again. Turn off the lights. It's the middle of the daytime, though.
[272.74s -> 278.58s]  I can't just turn the lights off. That's that's too much. It's too much for my brain.
[278.58s -> 286.62s]  I cannot sit in a dark room when it's light outside. Do it. No, I don't. It's it's daytime.
[286.62s -> 300.18s]  You're going to fuck with my cerebral. It's not going to do anything. There's light coming through the window over here.
[300.18s -> 316.45s]  My camera just auto adjusted because this this light coming. It didn't do anything. You think this is going to be scary?
[316.45s -> 334.88s]  No, boomer cerebral can't handle the dark. No, the boomers cerebral can't handle the red indicator that keeps popping up on my OBS.
[334.88s -> 342.62s]  The next time I get Internet, I'm going to ask a very specific question.
[342.62s -> 349.54s]  I'm going to ask, can I reach the moon in less than a tenth of a second?
[349.54s -> 355.54s]  And will it come back to me from the moon in less than a tenth of a second?
[355.54s -> 375.46s]  If the answer is no, I'm going to tell them to fuck off. Rude. I'll tell you what's rude.
[375.46s -> 387.85s]  You know what's rude? Charging fucking hundreds of dollars a month for a service that only wants to work like fucking 48 percent of the time.
[387.85s -> 406.36s]  That's pretty rude. That's real rude. Actually, it might even be goddamn illegal. It's not. That's rude. It's rude.
[406.36s -> 409.36s]  But it'll it'll fix itself. Don't worry.
[409.36s -> 416.50s]  They can't turn this back on. That looks so much worse. It looks terrible. I don't like how that looks.
[416.50s -> 426.86s]  In fact, let me move this where because I'm going to be like looking this way. Right.
[426.86s -> 438.62s]  So it needs to be like over here. That's way too far.
[438.62s -> 442.86s]  That's not that's good because I'm going to be like looking this way. Right.
[442.86s -> 450.75s]  You have to use the vlogger angle. I don't know what that means.
[450.75s -> 461.42s]  No, this is the one time like a year you're going to get a face cam. So let's do it. All right.
[461.42s -> 467.42s]  I might as well just go unless something really, really bad happens here, which I don't know if it will. It might.
[467.42s -> 473.06s]  What the fuck am I going to do? You know, what am I going to do?
[473.06s -> 487.14s]  Nothing. So let me just make sure. Let's hold on. Is this lined up correctly? Kind of is.
[487.14s -> 500.93s]  Let me just get it over here. Don't be mad already.
[500.93s -> 505.55s]  I don't know if mad is the right word. I think just disappointed is the right word.
[505.55s -> 521.87s]  I think the word is disappointed. But yeah.
[521.87s -> 525.87s]  What are we at? Ten percent of every frame drop. That's just fantastic.
[525.87s -> 533.11s]  What a great four hundred dollars a month service. Four hundred dollars a month.
[533.11s -> 543.61s]  Did you hear what I just said? That's a that's reality. Yeah.
[543.61s -> 548.23s]  You just heard me say that. That's Cox business. Works great, doesn't it?
[548.23s -> 565.51s]  No, not at all. Anyways, complain on Twitter.
[565.51s -> 568.51s]  No, here's what happens when you complain on Twitter, guys.
[568.51s -> 571.51s]  They have like people that automatically just watch.
[571.51s -> 577.75s]  Doesn't matter if it's Comcast, Cox, Disney Quest, whatever internet you have. It doesn't matter.
[577.75s -> 585.75s]  There are people that just scope through and try to find people put in hashtags of like hashtag Cox sucks.
[585.75s -> 589.75s]  Comcast sucks. And these support agents just go, hey, what happened? Are you OK?
[589.75s -> 596.62s]  And then you reply to them and they are they are like not even like the base level of technician.
[596.62s -> 601.79s]  They're like the they like get you in contact with like a base level technician.
[601.79s -> 605.29s]  They're just there to try to get you to shut up on Twitter.
[605.29s -> 622.78s]  It's it's stupid. And there are a lot of people that thought that I went.
[622.78s -> 629.05s]  I still have Comcast. No, I went from this is a completely different company.
[629.05s -> 633.05s]  This is a new ISP in a new state. It doesn't matter.
[633.05s -> 651.16s]  It's going to be fine. It will fix itself.
[651.16s -> 659.79s]  It will fix itself. It will. It just for it just for dumb, stupid, random reasons.
[659.79s -> 678.78s]  It'll just go to like 20 percent of what we pay for for like two hours, three hours in a row.
[678.78s -> 684.46s]  Stealing Wi-Fi from McDonald's. You know what? It would probably be better.
[684.46s -> 688.15s]  Why can't McDonald's make their own Internet? Think about this for real.
[688.15s -> 692.15s]  I want you to think about this because people are going to be like, what are you talking about?
[692.15s -> 697.22s]  McDonald's has some of the fastest service ever.
[697.22s -> 705.09s]  You pull up to the window. You order like a bunch of food and this shit is at the window 10 seconds later.
[705.09s -> 711.10s]  I bet you McDonald's could get a burger to the moon and back in less than fucking five seconds if they really wanted to.
[711.10s -> 721.68s]  I would I would love to pay for a McDonald's Internet.
[721.68s -> 727.97s]  Yeah, because they made it hours ago. So so what?
[727.97s -> 731.55s]  They could make the Internet hours ago.
[731.55s -> 737.55s]  They could just get the data package and like get it in a fucking box and get it ready and then send it out to customers.
[737.55s -> 743.94s]  Oh, you're over here now. Hi. Hi, everybody. My name is Jeremy and this is this is called. Let's wait out the Internet.
[743.94s -> 748.94s]  It's a fun game we play. I've been playing it since like 2016. It's very fun.
[748.94s -> 752.94s]  It's an interesting thing. Resident Evil 2 sounds like a fun game to play.
[752.94s -> 761.18s]  It will fix. It's going to it's going to fix itself.
[761.18s -> 765.66s]  I know it will. Fucking Internet.
[765.66s -> 772.71s]  Can I have to gonna have to fucking.
[772.71s -> 789.50s]  Are we going to just silently be angry here until this is like working?
[789.50s -> 796.90s]  I might have to sit here. We're going to have to go full screen then get this off.
[796.90s -> 799.40s]  Look, it's ready. It's right here.
[799.40s -> 802.40s]  The truck is there. I'm in the goddamn truck.
[802.40s -> 805.40s]  I'm ready to go. And it's stalled out. Look at that.
[805.40s -> 809.28s]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Sorry.
[809.28s -> 812.28s]  There's pedestrians crossing. Can't really go anywhere.
[812.28s -> 815.71s]  Sorry, Claire. I can't go anywhere. Yeah.
[815.71s -> 818.95s]  Oh, yeah. This is the Internet data is going across.
[818.95s -> 822.95s]  It's like a bunch of ducks. There's like seven thousand of we got to wait here for like four hours.
[822.95s -> 840.25s]  Well, let's let's go. Let's go ahead and just like do this.
[840.25s -> 844.25s]  Let's figure out what the hell I'm going to even do when I'm allowed to do anything.
[844.25s -> 851.00s]  So we got Leon or Claire. I was going to go Leon because Leon is from the original game.
[851.00s -> 853.00s]  Claire's from the original game, too.
[853.00s -> 857.00s]  But it don't use you start with Leon from the original game, right?
[857.00s -> 866.23s]  Do I have this is from my understanding, this is two completely different paths, right?
[866.23s -> 870.24s]  You got it's two completely different campaigns.
[870.24s -> 879.12s]  So that's OK. Do a smart click. I was going to play Leon of a huge fan of Resident Evil 4.
[879.12s -> 882.12s]  And this is the this is the sequel to Resident Evil 4 backwards.
[882.12s -> 898.11s]  So, you know, maybe if I just like go to the options menu for a while, you guys look, look, look, look.
[898.11s -> 906.04s]  You guys are going to make fun of my graphics settings for like 10 minutes and then we'll be able to do it.
[906.04s -> 912.54s]  This let me just hold on. I need to like just triple check something here.
[912.54s -> 914.54s]  I'm going to back out of this for a minute.
[914.54s -> 929.65s]  How do I exit the game? How do you exit Resident Evil 2? Is there no exit?
[929.65s -> 947.65s]  How do you exit? Because I need to exit to look at something, but I can't alt tab either.
[947.65s -> 954.88s]  How do I get out of here? Well, I was going to play Leon.
[954.88s -> 960.63s]  Assisted standard or hardcore assisted for players who are unfamiliar.
[960.63s -> 963.63s]  Aim assist recover a certain amount of health automatically and enemies are weaker.
[963.63s -> 967.87s]  I can't do that though. Normal. Hardcore.
[967.87s -> 977.18s]  Saving requires an ink ribbon, no autosave and I don't care about I don't care about the difficulty of the game.
[977.18s -> 982.38s]  It's the saving that I know we're not doing that.
[982.38s -> 1002.40s]  That looks absolutely delicious. Holy shit.
[1002.40s -> 1010.71s]  Is that a triple? Is that a quadruple? One, two, how many patties are in there?
[1010.71s -> 1017.09s]  That's at least two or three patties. He's eating the he's eating the wrapper too, I think.
[1017.09s -> 1021.58s]  That's what you don't, you can't eat and drive.
[1021.58s -> 1024.58s]  You might accidentally eat the wrapper. It's happened to me a couple times.
[1024.58s -> 1038.94s]  And I'm in the passenger seat, by the way.
[1038.94s -> 1057.12s]  He's gonna crash into something. What? No, no, not good.
[1057.12s -> 1066.61s]  For a second I thought he just flew out of the car. I was like, hold on, what happened?
[1066.61s -> 1084.42s]  Truck driver with a truck driver hat on.
[1084.42s -> 1107.14s]  That's a truck on that hat, isn't there? Just in case you were wondering what he did for a living.
[1107.14s -> 1112.44s]  What's the thing with Leon? It's Leon's birthday today, right? It's like his 18th birthday.
[1112.44s -> 1135.42s]  It's his first day on the 18th birthday. There he is.
[1135.42s -> 1154.98s]  Turn up the game? I will. I just have no control over the game right now. Don't worry.
[1154.98s -> 1166.75s]  We are open. Let's go.
[1166.75s -> 1178.91s]  All right, so let me explore your surroundings. Not yet, because I need to turn this up.
[1178.91s -> 1182.91s]  How bad is it? Is the internet still fucking bad? Are we still having problems here?
[1182.91s -> 1192.74s]  Stop dropping frames. I wish I could stop it.
[1192.74s -> 1198.22s]  You know, I do have to turn the lights off. It doesn't make any sense like this.
[1198.22s -> 1211.40s]  It's a little better, right? No. I'm like so out of place here.
[1211.40s -> 1229.34s]  There we go. Let's bring this down.
[1229.34s -> 1244.58s]  Now it looks like I actually belong in here. It's like darker. It's a little scarier, right?
[1244.58s -> 1247.58s]  I can already see people making fun of my sideburn. I can see it.
[1247.58s -> 1250.58s]  I don't even have to look at it in chat. I already know you're doing it.
[1250.58s -> 1255.65s]  All right. Pray that we get our internet back, but I'm just going to go.
[1255.65s -> 1257.65s]  What can I do, right?
[1257.65s -> 1259.65s]  Okay, here we go. Explore surroundings.
[1259.65s -> 1266.34s]  Speaking of brightness, this monitor is too bright.
[1266.34s -> 1271.59s]  How do I turn the brightness down on this?
[1271.59s -> 1281.13s]  Oh, I can just turn it off. But then I can't see chat.
[1281.13s -> 1294.66s]  Hold on. I got it. Oh, you piece of shit.
[1294.66s -> 1303.38s]  There we go. All right. That's better.
[1303.38s -> 1309.14s]  And yeah, I'm going to do whatever I can to stall because like fuck this internet.
[1309.14s -> 1312.98s]  All right. Explore surroundings.
[1312.98s -> 1314.98s]  Now I can actually fucking breathe.
[1314.98s -> 1320.99s]  Now we got a fire extinguisher. We got a gas pump.
[1320.99s -> 1325.00s]  Explore. Let's go take a look at the highway.
[1325.00s -> 1333.79s]  I'm just going to walk home. Beautiful game though.
[1333.79s -> 1347.85s]  It says explore your surroundings. It didn't say how far.
[1347.85s -> 1348.85s]  Nothing out here.
[1348.85s -> 1351.85s]  Okay. See, I want to make sure I know exactly what's going on.
[1351.85s -> 1355.66s]  And we had an anonymous five gifted subs.
[1355.66s -> 1359.42s]  Thank you from anonymous.
[1359.42s -> 1363.36s]  I got to check the other way too. There could, there might be mutants out there.
[1363.36s -> 1365.36s]  Hold on. I see an item in the distance.
[1365.36s -> 1368.36s]  That is a twinkling item on the ground over there.
[1368.36s -> 1370.36s]  And half of you guys didn't even do that.
[1370.36s -> 1373.66s]  See it all the way down there. You see the red, the orange and red.
[1373.66s -> 1379.74s]  I'm going to pick it up. It's going to be an Easter egg.
[1379.74s -> 1383.74s]  And then I'm going to be on the front page of every fucking subreddit.
[1383.74s -> 1398.02s]  Nevermind. I have to find a way to stall.
[1398.02s -> 1401.02s]  Because this is 7,000 drop frames guys.
[1401.02s -> 1404.02s]  I've been looking forward to this game for like fucking 30 years.
[1404.02s -> 1417.48s]  And you want me to like do it with like 20% drop frames?
[1417.48s -> 1419.48s]  Okay. Here's the cop car.
[1419.48s -> 1426.44s]  I'm just, we're just going to go in.
[1426.44s -> 1428.44s]  There's hamburgers in here. This is where the guy got the hamburger.
[1428.44s -> 1430.44s]  Okay. Let's just open the door.
[1430.44s -> 1435.60s]  But wait, this is important. Is this the part?
[1435.60s -> 1438.10s]  Hello? Anybody there?
[1438.10s -> 1447.27s]  I didn't even get to say my piece. How infuriating.
[1447.27s -> 1449.27s]  Something's not right.
[1449.27s -> 1454.07s]  458. I just heard something.
[1454.07s -> 1461.86s]  Up in the ceiling.
[1461.86s -> 1463.86s]  There's a guy crawling around in like the vent right now.
[1463.86s -> 1465.86s]  All right. Let's take a look around.
[1465.86s -> 1471.94s]  Ketchup.
[1471.94s -> 1474.94s]  Now that's all right. That's Heinz 57 sauce.
[1474.94s -> 1475.94s]  It's gross.
[1475.94s -> 1477.94s]  But after you eat it for more than like a couple minutes,
[1477.94s -> 1479.94s]  like four or five french fries in, you forget how gross it is.
[1479.94s -> 1482.94s]  And you start thinking it's actually kind of good.
[1482.94s -> 1488.96s]  You all right?
[1488.96s -> 1491.33s]  Don't move. I'll be back for you.
[1491.33s -> 1498.54s]  They're going to bite in the neck.
[1498.54s -> 1500.54s]  He's going to get it from behind.
[1500.54s -> 1520.90s]  Officer, you need help?
[1520.90s -> 1522.90s]  Stay back, sir. I got this.
[1522.90s -> 1524.90s]  Never take your eyes.
[1531.39s -> 1535.70s]  Oh my God. That's fucking so horrible looking.
[1535.70s -> 1538.19s]  Jesus.
[1538.19s -> 1540.19s]  Freeze. I'll shoot.
[1540.19s -> 1550.03s]  What?
[1550.03s -> 1552.66s]  That was so ridiculous.
[1552.66s -> 1554.96s]  That was every tendon.
[1554.96s -> 1556.96s]  There's points in there.
[1556.96s -> 1558.96s]  Fluid. That was horrible.
[1558.96s -> 1561.71s]  Showing off their new engine, huh?
[1561.71s -> 1566.06s]  There's a key.
[1566.06s -> 1568.06s]  Key is the inventory. Put it in here.
[1568.06s -> 1570.06s]  So you hold items and weapons, right?
[1570.06s -> 1572.88s]  Okay. Fine.
[1572.88s -> 1579.60s]  Escape from the store.
[1579.60s -> 1581.60s]  I might have to adjust the sensitivity on the...
[1581.60s -> 1584.86s]  Okay, I thought the shadow was a person.
[1584.86s -> 1586.86s]  God damn it. Where is he?
[1586.86s -> 1589.68s]  Oh, fuck.
[1589.68s -> 1596.27s]  How?
[1596.27s -> 1598.27s]  Don't even shoot him, right?
[1598.27s -> 1603.14s]  Conserving ammo.
[1603.14s -> 1605.14s]  I've already used like 30 bullets.
[1605.14s -> 1613.90s]  Come on. There's got to be like 30 bullets in here.
[1613.90s -> 1617.49s]  The store...
[1617.49s -> 1619.49s]  The guy's going to get up.
[1619.49s -> 1621.49s]  And he's going to fucking burst through the door.
[1621.49s -> 1627.06s]  Hold on.
[1627.06s -> 1633.26s]  Let's just go through there.
[1633.26s -> 1635.26s]  When you need to use an item to unlock a door or solve a puzzle,
[1635.26s -> 1637.26s]  select the item and then use the use command.
[1637.26s -> 1639.70s]  Would make sense, wouldn't it?
[1639.70s -> 1645.39s]  He's going to die in the store.
[1645.39s -> 1647.39s]  Why would I die in the store?
[1647.39s -> 1649.39s]  Jesus.
[1649.39s -> 1656.11s]  Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. How do I...
[1656.11s -> 1658.11s]  What's the run command? What's the run command?
[1658.11s -> 1660.11s]  What's the run command?
[1660.11s -> 1668.11s]  I'm not...
[1668.11s -> 1672.14s]  That's clear.
[1672.14s -> 1675.60s]  The bullets from me, right?
[1675.60s -> 1683.22s]  Pretty good gamer reactions.
[1683.22s -> 1685.22s]  Hey, thanks.
[1694.59s -> 1701.04s]  You didn't kill those guys?
[1701.04s -> 1703.04s]  You're terrible.
[1703.04s -> 1705.04s]  You're terrible.
[1705.04s -> 1707.79s]  I killed those guys in my place.
[1707.79s -> 1721.17s]  Hold on.
[1721.17s -> 1723.17s]  Alright, we made it out.
[1723.17s -> 1727.01s]  I win. I win. I win.
[1730.27s -> 1732.27s]  Huge bits from Great Canadian.
[1738.82s -> 1740.82s]  I'm Chris Redfield's daughter, right?
[1740.82s -> 1743.12s]  Whatever it is.
[1743.12s -> 1745.12s]  Thank you, Great Canadian, for the $50.
[1752.40s -> 1754.40s]  Twitch let me resub for free for some reason.
[1754.40s -> 1756.40s]  So this will cover it, I hope.
[1756.40s -> 1758.40s]  Cover it, like, 50 times.
[1758.40s -> 1761.60s]  Thank you so much, Great Canadian.
[1761.60s -> 1765.50s]  Capcom.
[1765.50s -> 1767.50s]  This is a Capcom game.
[1767.50s -> 1779.98s]  Capcom really just killing it lately.
[1779.98s -> 1786.38s]  What is this?
[1786.38s -> 1800.98s]  Just sitting on the desk.
[1800.98s -> 1802.98s]  Is it watchable? Are we alright?
[1802.98s -> 1804.98s]  Because I'm still looking over and I'm seeing, like,
[1804.98s -> 1806.98s]  the red indicator that's, like,
[1806.98s -> 1816.32s]  stop streaming Jeremy.
[1816.32s -> 1819.07s]  Resident Evil 2.
[1819.07s -> 1821.07s]  I was going to say earlier that I'm really excited for this game.
[1821.07s -> 1823.07s]  Not because of the game.
[1823.07s -> 1825.07s]  I'm trying to talk.
[1852.30s -> 1854.30s]  I mean, technically the zombies are survivors.
[1854.30s -> 1856.30s]  Right?
[1856.30s -> 1858.30s]  They're not completely dead.
[1858.30s -> 1871.10s]  Like, somehow.
[1871.10s -> 1874.30s]  They're not dead. They still have brain activity, guys.
[1874.30s -> 1876.30s]  You're not dead.
[1876.30s -> 1878.30s]  You're not completely dead.
[1885.60s -> 1892.96s]  Quick time. Are they quick time events?
[1892.96s -> 1901.39s]  That's a zombie driving a car.
[1901.39s -> 1903.39s]  Are you talking about...
[1903.39s -> 1905.39s]  Oh, no, it's not.
[1909.95s -> 1918.08s]  He's just speeding through.
[1918.08s -> 1920.77s]  Oh, he's dead.
[1920.77s -> 1928.00s]  Watch out.
[1928.00s -> 1935.55s]  Dripping oil.
[1935.55s -> 1938.50s]  Dripping gasoline.
[1938.50s -> 1943.55s]  Claire was probably in there, right?
[1943.55s -> 1947.01s]  That's what I'm thinking.
[1947.01s -> 1949.70s]  What is this?
[1949.70s -> 1953.34s]  This is loud.
[1953.34s -> 1955.34s]  We're going to have to turn the game down a little.
[1960.86s -> 1964.83s]  I remember this from the first one.
[1964.83s -> 1967.14s]  Oh, it's a guardian?
[1967.14s -> 1972.19s]  I gotta get out of here.
[1972.19s -> 1974.19s]  I gotta run.
[1976.82s -> 1978.82s]  Uh...
[1978.82s -> 1981.87s]  What's the run button?
[1981.87s -> 1983.87s]  How do you run?
[1983.87s -> 1986.43s]  I don't want to shoot. There's like 50 people there.
[1986.43s -> 1988.43s]  I just want to run.
[1988.43s -> 1991.25s]  Capcom, what's the run button?
[1991.25s -> 1999.44s]  Just tell me what the run button is.
[1999.44s -> 2007.38s]  Is there no run in this game?
[2007.38s -> 2009.38s]  Press in left stick.
[2009.38s -> 2011.38s]  That would have been great to know.
[2011.38s -> 2015.79s]  You know, just kill me.
[2015.79s -> 2017.79s]  Somebody kill me. Kill me.
[2017.79s -> 2020.67s]  Do it. Just bite my fucking neck open.
[2020.67s -> 2022.67s]  Kill me.
[2022.67s -> 2025.74s]  Just like every other game.
[2025.74s -> 2027.74s]  No, it's like B or A holding it.
[2027.74s -> 2036.83s]  No, it was actually X in the original one.
[2036.83s -> 2038.83s]  It was the face button here.
[2043.42s -> 2045.42s]  That's how Leon dies.
[2045.42s -> 2047.42s]  Let's check out Claire's side of the view.
[2047.42s -> 2049.42s]  Let's check out Claire's view.
[2049.42s -> 2051.42s]  No, wait. No, no, no.
[2051.42s -> 2056.61s]  Hold on. I wanted to...
[2056.61s -> 2058.61s]  No, that's fine.
[2058.61s -> 2063.86s]  I wanted to alt-tab before and I can't.
[2063.86s -> 2067.95s]  Just stop there for a second.
[2067.95s -> 2069.95s]  Do I really have to pull this out of borderless window
[2069.95s -> 2071.95s]  to alt-tab the game?
[2071.95s -> 2079.68s]  Because I can't move.
[2079.68s -> 2084.16s]  Hold on. Get out of the way for a second game.
[2084.16s -> 2087.62s]  Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
[2087.62s -> 2090.05s]  I'm just making sure I don't have anything open
[2090.05s -> 2092.05s]  that would be using any resources.
[2092.05s -> 2094.05s]  But I don't.
[2094.05s -> 2096.05s]  It was a long shot but it was worth a try.
[2096.05s -> 2101.17s]  Another huge amount of money just came in.
[2101.17s -> 2103.41s]  That was from
[2103.41s -> 2105.41s]  Miniclips.
[2105.41s -> 2107.41s]  Thank you, Miniclips, for the $50.
[2107.41s -> 2113.17s]  Off to a good start. Keep it up.
[2113.17s -> 2115.47s]  Thank you so much for the $50.
[2115.47s -> 2120.72s]  No, I tried to bait him.
[2120.72s -> 2122.72s]  You blame Cox for this.
[2122.72s -> 2124.72s]  Because I'm like, I'm like,
[2124.72s -> 2127.92s]  how many frames did you just drop today?
[2127.92s -> 2129.92s]  Blame this dog shit internet company.
[2129.92s -> 2141.42s]  Alright, let's go.
[2141.42s -> 2143.42s]  So which way should I go? This way?
[2143.42s -> 2149.17s]  Into the alley?
[2149.17s -> 2151.17s]  Oh, fuck.
[2151.17s -> 2154.18s]  Aging boomer can't
[2154.18s -> 2157.89s]  figure out internet.
[2157.89s -> 2159.89s]  No, it's called a bunch of fucking workers
[2159.89s -> 2161.89s]  just throw up a bunch of lines.
[2161.89s -> 2165.02s]  Bury a bunch of fucking lines.
[2165.02s -> 2167.02s]  Don't even care if it works.
[2167.02s -> 2169.02s]  They just build it. And then the company
[2169.02s -> 2171.02s]  that is responsible for it
[2171.02s -> 2173.02s]  just kind of goes, does it work?
[2173.02s -> 2175.02s]  Yeah, it technically works.
[2175.02s -> 2177.02s]  Alright, then fucking just turn it on for everybody. Who cares?
[2177.02s -> 2180.29s]  I don't know, there might be like a problem.
[2180.29s -> 2182.29s]  I think there's like water down there.
[2182.29s -> 2184.29s]  No, I fucking just turn it on for everybody. Who cares?
[2184.29s -> 2198.37s]  How much would it cost for us to like fix that?
[2198.37s -> 2200.80s]  Like 40 grand?
[2200.80s -> 2203.10s]  I don't know about that.
[2203.10s -> 2205.10s]  How much did we take in last month from subscriptions?
[2205.10s -> 2207.10s]  12 million.
[2207.10s -> 2209.10s]  No, I don't know about that.
[2209.10s -> 2211.10s]  I don't think that's worth it.
[2211.10s -> 2213.10s]  No, no, just keep it on. Turn it on.
[2213.10s -> 2216.69s]  No, hold on. I gotta pay attention. Hold on.
[2216.69s -> 2236.77s]  It's like seriously.
[2236.77s -> 2239.14s]  I bet you whatever this problem is
[2239.14s -> 2241.14s]  could be solved if just somebody
[2241.14s -> 2244.08s]  gave a shit.
[2244.08s -> 2246.08s]  You know what I mean? Like
[2246.08s -> 2248.08s]  if anybody, if anybody
[2248.08s -> 2250.08s]  from here to here just gave a shit
[2250.08s -> 2253.02s]  this wouldn't happen.
[2253.02s -> 2262.24s]  Oh, I remember this place. This is the police station.
[2262.24s -> 2265.44s]  Jerma is mad.
[2265.44s -> 2267.44s]  I am because it's fucking stupid.
[2267.44s -> 2269.94s]  Hello? Is anybody here?
[2269.94s -> 2274.67s]  And they go bolts. Alright, that's six.
[2274.67s -> 2276.67s]  You get six handgun ammo.
[2276.67s -> 2280.64s]  Takes up a spot in the inventory, right?
[2280.64s -> 2285.44s]  Okay, we got a
[2285.44s -> 2287.44s]  RPD. This is the storage box.
[2287.44s -> 2289.81s]  And a save point.
[2289.81s -> 2291.81s]  Thank god I don't have to do the
[2291.81s -> 2293.81s]  hardcore ribbon shit.
[2293.81s -> 2299.18s]  Sometimes there's stuff in the boxes
[2299.18s -> 2301.18s]  but I think a key, well-worn
[2301.18s -> 2303.81s]  key. I don't
[2303.81s -> 2305.81s]  think I'm gonna need this. This is the key to the
[2305.81s -> 2311.76s]  store. Uh, probably shouldn't
[2311.76s -> 2317.97s]  have this anymore. Right?
[2317.97s -> 2319.97s]  I mean is that, that's not like a
[2319.97s -> 2321.97s]  skeleton key, right?
[2321.97s -> 2327.79s]  Do I write for IGN?
[2327.79s -> 2333.23s]  What?
[2344.18s -> 2346.74s]  Watch out! There's Chickie over there on the bottom
[2346.74s -> 2349.30s]  right camera. Check camera, no, no
[2349.30s -> 2351.30s]  camera three. Freddy's on camera
[2351.30s -> 2357.44s]  three. Go check it.
[2357.44s -> 2366.72s]  You guys wouldn't believe it.
[2366.72s -> 2369.28s]  Doesn't matter. Like when I was
[2369.28s -> 2371.28s]  in, when I was in Massachusetts
[2371.28s -> 2374.03s]  and now I'm fucking in Las Vegas. Doesn't matter.
[2374.03s -> 2376.03s]  You know how many people you have to go through
[2376.03s -> 2378.03s]  before you find the guy that's like, yeah I guess
[2378.03s -> 2380.85s]  I'll take care of that. Like
[2380.85s -> 2382.85s]  this is just like super ultra
[2382.85s -> 2385.02s]  company bullshit. There's a
[2385.02s -> 2387.02s]  guy that you have to talk to to see if you
[2387.02s -> 2389.02s]  have a real problem. Then that guy has to talk
[2389.02s -> 2391.02s]  to another guy above him about how your problem's real.
[2391.02s -> 2393.02s]  That guy then has to be
[2393.02s -> 2395.02s]  currently caring about your current situation to talk
[2395.02s -> 2397.02s]  to the guy above him to say
[2397.02s -> 2399.02s]  we have to fix the problem that's going on with the guy. Guy
[2399.02s -> 2401.02s]  five below me said there was an issue but
[2401.02s -> 2403.02s]  Guy two said it might not be an issue. Guy
[2403.02s -> 2405.02s]  eleven, that's like the regional
[2405.02s -> 2423.97s]  manager. Jerma stop it's
[2423.97s -> 2427.49s]  getting annoying. Like
[2427.49s -> 2429.49s]  this? You're talking about like me dropping
[2429.49s -> 2431.49s]  a dickload of frames.
[2431.49s -> 2440.32s]  That is annoying, you're right.
[2440.32s -> 2442.32s]  Alright put gun in circle left.
[2442.32s -> 2449.36s]  Bullets in circle right.
[2449.36s -> 2452.05s]  Alright so
[2452.05s -> 2458.19s]  do I have a knife yet? I don't think I do.
[2458.19s -> 2464.66s]  Not yet. Can you please adjust
[2464.66s -> 2467.41s]  your internet? Alright so I need
[2467.41s -> 2469.78s]  to go. Let's
[2469.78s -> 2472.34s]  So here's the map.
[2472.34s -> 2474.34s]  The map is very useful
[2474.34s -> 2476.34s]  for more than just your current location and surroundings.
[2476.34s -> 2478.34s]  It will also show you points of interest in items you have found
[2478.34s -> 2483.78s]  and haven't picked up yet.
[2483.78s -> 2486.46s]  Oh that's cool. Taped box.
[2486.46s -> 2488.90s]  Goddess statue. So it will tell you pretty much
[2488.90s -> 2490.90s]  everything in the room. That's really cool.
[2490.90s -> 2493.20s]  The door over here, I wonder
[2493.20s -> 2495.50s]  if I can open it. Let's find out.
[2495.50s -> 2505.23s]  You probably have a bunch of
[2505.23s -> 2507.54s]  torrents seating. I would
[2507.54s -> 2509.84s]  be very surprised. I need
[2509.84s -> 2511.84s]  the spade key to open this door which I do not have.
[2511.84s -> 2513.84s]  So let's go take a look upstairs.
[2513.84s -> 2532.90s]  Let me see. Two doors
[2532.90s -> 2535.33s]  up here. How is this one?
[2535.33s -> 2538.02s]  This one opens. Alright isn't there like
[2538.02s -> 2540.02s]  a police chief in here?
[2540.02s -> 2548.32s]  From what I remember.
[2548.32s -> 2552.48s]  Somebody above? Alright I got the herb.
[2552.48s -> 2554.78s]  Uh
[2554.78s -> 2556.78s]  combining herbs. I'm going to have to remember
[2556.78s -> 2561.14s]  this shit. This safe.
[2561.14s -> 2563.89s]  Anybody know? No don't tell me the combination.
[2563.89s -> 2580.26s]  I don't want to know. Shit. Alright we got
[2580.26s -> 2582.26s]  a photograph here. Guide
[2582.26s -> 2584.26s]  pamphlet. Welcome to Raccoon City.
[2584.26s -> 2586.26s]  Did you know? Well we are the home
[2586.26s -> 2588.26s]  of pharmaceutical giant umbrella corporation.
[2588.26s -> 2590.26s]  Raccoon City is a vibrant and dynamic
[2590.26s -> 2592.26s]  city with a long rich history of its own.
[2592.26s -> 2594.26s]  In this guide we'll introduce you to a few more
[2594.26s -> 2596.26s]  unusual points of interest.
[2596.26s -> 2599.01s]  The police station.
[2599.01s -> 2601.18s]  Inside the police station
[2601.18s -> 2604.06s]  there are
[2604.06s -> 2606.06s]  the skipping makes my webcam look
[2606.06s -> 2608.06s]  pre-recorded. Look. Ready? It's not
[2608.06s -> 2610.06s]  one, two, three. See?
[2610.06s -> 2612.75s]  Various features like the unusual clock
[2612.75s -> 2614.75s]  tower. Yeah, yeah. This is an orphanage.
[2614.75s -> 2616.75s]  It's pretty cool.
[2616.75s -> 2621.23s]  Any more points of interest?
[2621.23s -> 2623.23s]  There is the safe. That's it.
[2623.23s -> 2625.23s]  This door needs a spade key. I don't have it.
[2625.23s -> 2629.25s]  So let's keep going.
[2629.25s -> 2632.45s]  What do we got here for Coca-Cola?
[2632.45s -> 2634.45s]  We got Campa, Arta,
[2634.45s -> 2636.94s]  food,
[2636.94s -> 2640.38s]  food.
[2640.38s -> 2642.38s]  Crack open a food soda.
[2642.38s -> 2650.06s]  It's also across the hall.
[2650.06s -> 2652.37s]  And then I could leave and
[2652.37s -> 2654.74s]  check the other parts of the town.
[2654.74s -> 2662.22s]  But let's just see what's up here first.
[2662.22s -> 2664.22s]  Another puzzle with some
[2664.22s -> 2666.85s]  dials on it.
[2666.85s -> 2669.47s]  All information that will be presented
[2669.47s -> 2671.47s]  in some way or another.
[2671.47s -> 2676.46s]  I'm going to have to get my notebook.
[2676.46s -> 2678.46s]  Spade key as well.
[2678.46s -> 2683.58s]  I cannot go in any of these rooms.
[2683.58s -> 2685.58s]  There are bullets up here, which is good.
[2685.58s -> 2689.23s]  And that leaves us with
[2689.23s -> 2694.93s]  going back downstairs.
[2694.93s -> 2696.93s]  Pre-recorded? Confirmed?
[2696.93s -> 2699.17s]  Oh, you want me to dab?
[2699.17s -> 2701.17s]  Well, that's not going to happen. Just use the emote
[2701.17s -> 2706.16s]  and pretend I did it. Just pretend
[2706.16s -> 2711.02s]  I did it with the emote.
[2711.02s -> 2713.65s]  So let's go back out.
[2713.65s -> 2715.65s]  This is the interrogation room.
[2715.65s -> 2719.30s]  Let's save first, just so I have a clean slate.
[2719.30s -> 2721.30s]  Can't get in there, can't get in there, can't get in there.
[2721.30s -> 2728.53s]  You dabbed?
[2728.53s -> 2730.53s]  Well, I did just wipe my nose.
[2730.53s -> 2733.22s]  You're not completely wrong here.
[2733.22s -> 2735.22s]  First aid spray.
[2735.22s -> 2739.25s]  Pick it up.
[2739.25s -> 2741.25s]  Did I miss? I didn't miss anything down here.
[2741.25s -> 2743.25s]  I better not have.
[2743.25s -> 2755.39s]  Did I crawl under here?
[2755.39s -> 2766.19s]  Alright.
[2766.19s -> 2768.19s]  It says keep out, but that's alright.
[2768.19s -> 2774.66s]  I'll go in. So you got company yet?
[2774.66s -> 2786.94s]  You got guy like number 11.
[2786.94s -> 2792.38s]  Alright, I need to fuse.
[2792.38s -> 2804.67s]  Nothing back there. Let's just go.
[2804.67s -> 2806.67s]  East office. Let's check the office.
[2806.67s -> 2809.04s]  If I can. I can't.
[2809.04s -> 2823.70s]  I'm going to be so meticulous here, guys.
[2823.70s -> 2826.83s]  I'm sorry, I have to.
[2826.83s -> 2831.04s]  What's this? Don't talk.
[2831.04s -> 2833.54s]  Why would you talk?
[2833.54s -> 2844.42s]  My press room is right here to the left.
[2844.42s -> 2850.62s]  God damn it. Okay.
[2850.62s -> 2852.62s]  Press room. Turn the lights on.
[2852.62s -> 2855.18s]  Ooh, bullets. Nice.
[2855.18s -> 2857.18s]  Only three? How did you only have three bullets?
[2857.18s -> 2861.41s]  You didn't come prepared.
[2861.41s -> 2863.41s]  Alright, finally. Good.
[2863.41s -> 2870.51s]  I can actually see what the hell I'm doing.
[2870.51s -> 2872.51s]  I can think of a pretty good joke here where I give a fake speech
[2872.51s -> 2874.75s]  like I'm talking to the press.
[2874.75s -> 2876.75s]  But it would just devolve into me talking about cocks.
[2876.75s -> 2879.57s]  So, I'm not going to do that.
[2879.57s -> 2890.45s]  No!
[2890.45s -> 2892.45s]  It's the
[2892.45s -> 2894.45s]  name of the terrible
[2894.45s -> 2902.13s]  company.
[2902.13s -> 2905.07s]  Did I miss?
[2905.07s -> 2907.07s]  All typewriter shaped objects, save points?
[2907.07s -> 2914.54s]  I guess not.
[2914.54s -> 2916.54s]  Do the speech. No, I'm not.
[2916.54s -> 2922.03s]  No speeches.
[2922.03s -> 2924.03s]  No speeches, just
[2924.03s -> 2926.03s]  sunny beaches.
[2926.03s -> 2936.78s]  No speeches, sunny beaches.
[2936.78s -> 2950.99s]  Okay, I'm good. Cleaning in progress.
[2950.99s -> 2954.64s]  Hydrate.
[2954.64s -> 2956.82s]  Yep. It's over here.
[2956.82s -> 2960.59s]  Got a bathroom.
[2960.59s -> 2962.59s]  And, alright, what's in the bathroom?
[2962.59s -> 2967.97s]  It's not really going to be in the stall.
[2967.97s -> 2971.42s]  But there was the door closing behind me.
[2971.42s -> 2975.39s]  There's going to be a person in one of these stalls.
[2975.39s -> 2977.39s]  This is a horror game.
[2977.39s -> 2992.80s]  Nope. Just the wet bandits
[2992.80s -> 2996.26s]  that's all.
[2996.26s -> 3000.99s]  No bullets or anything in here? Why even let me come in here?
[3000.99s -> 3010.90s]  What was that?
[3010.90s -> 3022.53s]  Lantern? Can I like pick up the
[3022.53s -> 3030.21s]  lantern? No, I don't think so.
[3030.21s -> 3032.21s]  Blind. He's blind. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean he's blind?
[3032.21s -> 3036.30s]  Did I miss something?
[3036.30s -> 3043.26s]  What did I miss?
[3043.26s -> 3045.26s]  I thought it was like hairspray. I didn't think it was like
[3045.26s -> 3047.50s]  a healing item.
[3047.50s -> 3049.50s]  I thought that was like shhh for your
[3049.50s -> 3055.90s]  head. I'm going to sneeze.
[3055.90s -> 3068.42s]  Okay.
[3068.42s -> 3070.42s]  What's in here? Coffee.
[3070.42s -> 3072.42s]  I could use some right now.
[3072.42s -> 3078.62s]  Jesus.
[3078.62s -> 3080.62s]  This is something wrong here.
[3080.62s -> 3082.62s]  This is something
[3082.62s -> 3084.86s]  wrong here. I'm just going to leave
[3084.86s -> 3086.86s]  it. Maybe I can shoot it off.
[3086.86s -> 3089.66s]  It's possible. Although that's a waste
[3089.66s -> 3093.31s]  of a bullet, isn't it? We just had
[3093.31s -> 3095.31s]  five community subs come in from Herbert.
[3095.31s -> 3097.31s]  Thank you, Herbert, for the five community subs.
[3097.31s -> 3099.55s]  Congratulations to all of you that got a community
[3099.55s -> 3105.23s]  sub.
[3105.23s -> 3107.60s]  Where?
[3107.60s -> 3109.60s]  No, wrong one. Sorry.
[3109.60s -> 3113.38s]  Are you still alive?
[3113.38s -> 3115.38s]  I can't open the door, dude. I'm sorry. The door
[3115.38s -> 3117.74s]  is locked. Just he's blocking
[3117.74s -> 3123.63s]  it with his body.
[3123.63s -> 3127.14s]  Oh, he's talking about here.
[3127.14s -> 3132.58s]  I've got cash.
[3132.58s -> 3135.71s]  I'll take that cash.
[3135.71s -> 3152.29s]  Quick. Put him back under the rug.
[3152.29s -> 3166.69s]  Put him back under. My God.
[3166.69s -> 3168.69s]  That's disgusting. It's ridiculous.
[3168.69s -> 3171.12s]  Officers notebook.
[3171.12s -> 3173.12s]  OK, hold on. Goddess statue.
[3173.12s -> 3175.12s]  And then we get three. Three medallions.
[3175.12s -> 3178.13s]  This guy was just playing the game.
[3178.13s -> 3180.50s]  He was almost done with
[3180.50s -> 3183.57s]  figuring it out. So
[3183.57s -> 3185.57s]  the statue that goes down underneath.
[3185.57s -> 3188.00s]  So after you put the three medallions
[3188.00s -> 3190.00s]  in, you can go through underneath
[3190.00s -> 3194.93s]  the statue and then get out.
[3194.93s -> 3196.93s]  OK, so we got
[3196.93s -> 3199.23s]  some symbols here.
[3199.23s -> 3201.23s]  Which now will allow us to go to the
[3201.23s -> 3203.23s]  symbol machine and spin it around until we get
[3203.23s -> 3207.20s]  out of here. OK.
[3207.20s -> 3210.58s]  Do you have anything out here?
[3210.58s -> 3215.87s]  Whoa!
[3215.87s -> 3228.99s]  Oh, fuck. OK.
[3228.99s -> 3234.67s]  Take a left up here.
[3234.67s -> 3236.67s]  Left and then left.
[3236.67s -> 3240.38s]  No, let's get to the fuse box.
[3240.38s -> 3251.84s]  Yeah, no, that'll work. Let's go.
[3251.84s -> 3253.84s]  Jesus! They're everywhere.
[3253.84s -> 3273.41s]  Ah! Point precision. Sometimes
[3273.41s -> 3275.41s]  you have to be good at it, you know.
[3275.41s -> 3277.41s]  You've got to be prepared sometimes.
[3277.41s -> 3279.41s]  Quick time.
[3279.41s -> 3285.86s]  Brush his head.
[3285.86s -> 3288.67s]  Nice work.
[3288.67s -> 3294.80s]  There, there's the chief.
[3300.88s -> 3302.88s]  Stock sound effects.
[3316.50s -> 3322.96s]  Alright, so now I have the...
[3335.63s -> 3337.63s]  I'm not going to mention his stomach.
[3339.94s -> 3342.69s]  Hey, dude, I got some spray paint
[3342.69s -> 3344.69s]  for that wound.
[3372.56s -> 3375.57s]  Just open your mouth.
[3378.13s -> 3381.07s]  Stop.
[3381.07s -> 3383.07s]  I can't take your lightsaber.
[3383.07s -> 3385.07s]  Take it. Fine.
[3385.07s -> 3387.89s]  A Jedi never can give up his lightsaber.
[3416.06s -> 3420.67s]  Knife.
[3433.36s -> 3437.44s]  What? OK.
[3437.44s -> 3439.44s]  How do I repair it?
[3439.44s -> 3441.44s]  Do I only get one knife with one
[3441.44s -> 3443.44s]  bar of damage I'm allowed to do?
[3443.44s -> 3448.69s]  OK. Left bumper
[3448.69s -> 3451.31s]  and rod. Is it not equipped?
[3467.74s -> 3469.74s]  Interestingly enough, I'm looking at the same thing over here.
[3469.74s -> 3472.37s]  I'm looking at my...
[3472.37s -> 3474.37s]  I'm going to give you a Cox internet dog shit
[3474.37s -> 3476.37s]  reference, right?
[3476.37s -> 3478.37s]  The green is fine. I've been yellow this whole time
[3478.37s -> 3480.37s]  and then sometimes it drops to danger
[3480.37s -> 3482.99s]  for an hour straight.
[3482.99s -> 3484.99s]  What a great reference. He's still angry and he won't get over it.
[3484.99s -> 3486.99s]  I can't get over it. It's not going to happen.
[3486.99s -> 3491.52s]  Alright, so it's equipped.
[3491.52s -> 3493.52s]  OK, so you have to hit them both
[3493.52s -> 3495.89s]  to...
[3495.89s -> 3498.13s]  I guess not, OK.
[3498.13s -> 3500.13s]  I'm not using durability.
[3500.13s -> 3503.58s]  Thanks for the jump scare.
[3503.58s -> 3506.02s]  For whoever just called me.
[3506.02s -> 3509.15s]  Alright, let's go.
[3509.15s -> 3511.15s]  I've got to go back up here.
[3511.15s -> 3519.47s]  So let's see the symbols.
[3519.47s -> 3522.16s]  We can go...
[3522.16s -> 3525.49s]  Looks like I have a notebook.
[3525.49s -> 3528.43s]  Should I go lion?
[3528.43s -> 3530.43s]  Lion, witch, or wardrobe? Which one?
[3530.43s -> 3532.93s]  I'm going to go...
[3532.93s -> 3534.93s]  Lion's just right here.
[3534.93s -> 3537.74s]  So we need lion,
[3537.74s -> 3539.74s]  herb, and then dove.
[3539.74s -> 3549.66s]  This is going to take us to...
[3549.66s -> 3554.14s]  There we go.
[3554.14s -> 3556.14s]  Thank you, lion medallion.
[3556.14s -> 3560.69s]  I've got to put something in the box.
[3560.69s -> 3563.25s]  Next one is...
[3563.25s -> 3566.32s]  Lady arrow snake.
[3566.32s -> 3575.47s]  I can't do it again.
[3575.47s -> 3582.30s]  Oh, OK.
[3582.30s -> 3584.61s]  Well, might as well just put it in.
[3584.61s -> 3594.53s]  Cool.
[3594.53s -> 3597.73s]  Alright.
[3597.73s -> 3599.73s]  I need two more.
[3599.73s -> 3606.06s]  What are you playing over there?
[3606.06s -> 3608.82s]  Alright, now let's see.
[3608.82s -> 3612.27s]  I had...
[3612.27s -> 3614.27s]  East office. Let's save it.
[3614.27s -> 3624.45s]  I could use the
[3624.45s -> 3627.07s]  heal, but
[3627.07s -> 3630.27s]  I don't think I need to yet.
[3630.27s -> 3632.90s]  I could use the herb, but you can combine
[3632.90s -> 3634.90s]  herbs and shit in this game.
[3634.90s -> 3638.86s]  I'm not going to do it yet.
[3638.86s -> 3640.86s]  Why am I being selfish? Give him the first aid spray.
[3640.86s -> 3649.74s]  OK.
[3649.74s -> 3651.92s]  So, we've got...
[3651.92s -> 3653.92s]  OK, go back over here.
[3653.92s -> 3656.10s]  I don't think I can even leave this way.
[3656.10s -> 3658.10s]  Oh, no, the taped boxes right here.
[3658.10s -> 3660.72s]  That's right. Let's go check it out.
[3660.72s -> 3662.96s]  Why are my graphics so bad?
[3662.96s -> 3665.26s]  I don't think they are.
[3665.26s -> 3667.26s]  What's wrong with my graphics?
[3667.26s -> 3674.67s]  Image quality, 100%.
[3674.67s -> 3676.98s]  Anti-aliasing.
[3676.98s -> 3678.98s]  Texture quality, high.
[3678.98s -> 3680.98s]  Texture filter, high.
[3680.98s -> 3682.98s]  Mesh quality, medium.
[3682.98s -> 3684.98s]  High, on, on, on.
[3684.98s -> 3688.16s]  Medium.
[3688.16s -> 3691.30s]  High.
[3691.30s -> 3695.71s]  What's wrong?
[3695.71s -> 3701.02s]  Turned off the bloom? Turned off the motion blur?
[3701.02s -> 3703.02s]  Yeah, I'm an old Counter-Strike pro, guys.
[3703.02s -> 3705.02s]  I don't put on graphics.
[3705.02s -> 3707.02s]  I can see better when there's not a bunch of bloom and shit.
[3707.02s -> 3717.25s]  Alright.
[3717.25s -> 3719.25s]  I was about to potentially just waste.
[3719.25s -> 3727.06s]  Film grain is not on?
[3727.06s -> 3729.06s]  What do you mean?
[3729.06s -> 3731.06s]  Film grain?
[3731.06s -> 3733.06s]  The film grain is off.
[3733.06s -> 3735.06s]  At least I thought I turned it off.
[3735.06s -> 3742.42s]  Film noise is off? What?
[3742.42s -> 3755.97s]  Put it on!
[3755.97s -> 3757.97s]  Alright, now let's go. Let's do this.
[3757.97s -> 3762.51s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3762.51s -> 3764.51s]  I'm such a hoarder.
[3764.51s -> 3767.26s]  Because there's yellow and red herbs too, right?
[3767.26s -> 3780.06s]  Dude on the lowest graphics.
[3780.06s -> 3782.06s]  I would never.
[3782.06s -> 3785.39s]  Alright, let's just leave.
[3785.39s -> 3794.54s]  Nothing else in here.
[3794.54s -> 3799.02s]  Okay, what do we got?
[3799.02s -> 3801.97s]  I'm not gonna, no.
[3801.97s -> 3803.97s]  I'm not doing the 3DS port joke again.
[3803.97s -> 3812.10s]  Here, I'll do,
[3812.10s -> 3814.91s]  here's what I'll do for you.
[3814.91s -> 3816.91s]  Because one guy told me to do this.
[3816.91s -> 3821.97s]  So, one guy is gonna get it.
[3821.97s -> 3829.84s]  We'll do TAA, okay?
[3829.84s -> 3833.22s]  That actually looks worse for me.
[3833.22s -> 3836.03s]  That looks worse.
[3836.03s -> 3838.03s]  It looks like somebody blew, like, cold air
[3838.03s -> 3849.55s]  in my eyes.
[3849.55s -> 3857.10s]  Honestly, gelatin.
[3857.10s -> 3864.66s]  You got anything else you got?
[3864.66s -> 3872.40s]  What do you want to do with the window?
[3872.40s -> 3878.29s]  Okay, I need the
[3878.29s -> 3880.29s]  club key.
[3880.29s -> 3890.85s]  Something's gonna happen here.
[3890.85s -> 3892.85s]  Somebody's gonna attack me.
[3892.85s -> 3897.46s]  I'm trying to remember.
[3897.46s -> 3899.46s]  Look at how long this hallway is.
[3899.46s -> 3901.46s]  This hallway's too long for there not to be
[3901.46s -> 3904.53s]  something that comes up.
[3904.53s -> 3906.53s]  What do you want me to do with the window here?
[3906.53s -> 3917.09s]  Yep.
[3917.09s -> 3919.33s]  Okay, I was ready for it.
[3919.33s -> 3921.33s]  Open the, open the blinds.
[3921.33s -> 3928.30s]  Did you get in? Did you get in?
[3928.30s -> 3930.30s]  I think you got in. But wait, is there anything over here?
[3930.30s -> 3932.30s]  Any items? Did you get, you got in.
[3932.30s -> 3938.19s]  Okay, let's go, go, go, go, go.
[3938.19s -> 3943.31s]  They're not smart enough to follow me in here, right?
[3943.31s -> 3945.62s]  Okay, there's a way to go that way. Hold on.
[3945.62s -> 3947.62s]  What's this? Record of events.
[3947.62s -> 3949.62s]  Uh, we're turning the station into a temporary shelter
[3949.62s -> 3952.30s]  due to the massive sudden outbreak.
[3952.30s -> 3954.30s]  All police personnel have been instructed to make
[3954.30s -> 3956.86s]  the safety of the citizens their top priority.
[3956.86s -> 3958.86s]  Uh, and then all,
[3958.86s -> 3962.19s]  all hell broke loose and it went to shit.
[3962.19s -> 3964.19s]  Yeah, it is a lag stream today, unfortunately.
[3964.19s -> 3969.38s]  This is wild.
[3969.38s -> 3972.13s]  I don't think there was one drop frame at all
[3972.13s -> 3974.13s]  two days ago. It's, it's ridiculous
[3974.13s -> 3976.13s]  that like, not even two days later,
[3976.13s -> 3978.13s]  it's like barely a streamable day.
[3978.13s -> 3981.78s]  I wish there was something I could do.
[3981.78s -> 3987.22s]  Alright, I got a police station first floor
[3987.22s -> 3991.70s]  map, which is good.
[3991.70s -> 3993.70s]  Okay, open that up a lot. Good.
[3993.70s -> 3996.96s]  So, going over here, this is the safety
[3996.96s -> 3999.39s]  deposit room. Or towards
[3999.39s -> 4001.76s]  the safety deposit room.
[4001.76s -> 4011.81s]  See if I can, can I open this door?
[4011.81s -> 4014.69s]  Yep. I need like
[4014.69s -> 4026.46s]  wire cutters or something.
[4026.46s -> 4029.60s]  Okay, so can I bang a
[4029.60s -> 4031.60s]  left up here into the safety deposit
[4031.60s -> 4033.60s]  room or is that, no that was locked, wasn't it?
[4033.60s -> 4039.10s]  Can I turn the flashlight off?
[4039.10s -> 4061.10s]  Ah, what is this?
[4061.10s -> 4064.37s]  More handgun ammo?
[4064.37s -> 4066.67s]  Alright, I got a lot of ammo, so I
[4066.67s -> 4068.67s]  should be okay to at least shoot somebody once.
[4068.67s -> 4073.09s]  One bullet should be
[4073.09s -> 4076.54s]  used as a gunpowder.
[4076.54s -> 4079.04s]  Two, gunpowder times two is
[4079.04s -> 4081.04s]  handgun ammo. Gunpowder plus high grade gunpowder.
[4081.04s -> 4083.04s]  So gunpowder plus yellow is shotgun.
[4083.04s -> 4085.04s]  And then gunpowder plus
[4085.04s -> 4087.04s]  two yellows is mag
[4087.04s -> 4092.74s]  ammo. There's not a lot of ammo left
[4092.74s -> 4094.74s]  around the station to make you just spend a gunpowder you find.
[4094.74s -> 4096.74s]  Different guns require different ammo.
[4096.74s -> 4098.74s]  So pay attention when you're combining things or you won't get
[4098.74s -> 4106.80s]  what you need. Gunpowder.
[4106.80s -> 4117.66s]  Okay, I have to shoot this guy
[4117.66s -> 4119.66s]  in the head. I gotta kill this guy I think.
[4119.66s -> 4123.95s]  I have to shoot him. I have to kill him.
[4123.95s -> 4130.03s]  God damn it, really?
[4130.03s -> 4133.94s]  Okay, get me out.
[4133.94s -> 4142.38s]  Before he gets up, he might get up.
[4142.38s -> 4146.29s]  Alright, no more. Don't shoot anybody else.
[4146.29s -> 4148.29s]  Let's see what we got. We got a spade key. We got
[4148.29s -> 4150.29s]  something over here. That's a safe.
[4150.29s -> 4153.68s]  What the hell?
[4153.68s -> 4155.68s]  What the hell was that? What the fuck?
[4155.68s -> 4158.82s]  What the fuck, man? Okay.
[4158.82s -> 4162.14s]  Your mission is to unlock
[4162.14s -> 4164.14s]  your desk. The key to your success
[4164.14s -> 4166.14s]  is in the initials
[4166.14s -> 4168.14s]  of our first names.
[4168.14s -> 4170.45s]  Input the letters in order of our
[4170.45s -> 4172.88s]  desks. There are two
[4172.88s -> 4174.88s]  locks, one on each side of your desk.
[4174.88s -> 4176.88s]  Make sure you get them both.
[4176.88s -> 4180.02s]  Basically, your first task is to remember
[4180.02s -> 4182.02s]  your fellow officer's names, but you figured
[4182.02s -> 4184.02s]  that much out, right? Good luck, Leon.
[4184.02s -> 4186.02s]  By the way, it might take a little
[4186.02s -> 4188.02s]  work to get Scott to give you a straight
[4188.02s -> 4191.98s]  answer. Be glad you're not
[4191.98s -> 4197.23s]  here, rookie.
[4197.23s -> 4199.23s]  They're just fucking with me on my first
[4199.23s -> 4202.11s]  day.
[4202.11s -> 4204.11s]  In the initials of our first names,
[4204.11s -> 4206.11s]  input the letters in order of our desks.
[4206.11s -> 4209.12s]  So we got Scott.
[4209.12s -> 4211.12s]  Right? What does it say? Scott?
[4211.12s -> 4215.28s]  So, S.
[4215.28s -> 4220.21s]  So who else? Who wrote this?
[4220.21s -> 4226.16s]  S and B?
[4226.16s -> 4228.53s]  S, B?
[4228.53s -> 4239.28s]  Okay, well let's put it away.
[4239.28s -> 4247.71s]  What? Hold on.
[4247.71s -> 4249.71s]  The initials of our first names?
[4249.71s -> 4258.22s]  Does this have an S?
[4258.22s -> 4262.32s]  I'm going to have to look at everybody's
[4262.32s -> 4270.70s]  name tags. Cops are
[4270.70s -> 4272.70s]  known for their love of puzzles.
[4272.70s -> 4276.98s]  Okay, so let me
[4276.98s -> 4278.98s]  look at that one more time. Cause
[4278.98s -> 4285.70s]  we gotta go look at the desks.
[4285.70s -> 4288.26s]  Okay, this is David.
[4288.26s -> 4290.26s]  David, David Ford.
[4290.26s -> 4292.26s]  Alright, this guy's gotta die. Maybe not.
[4292.26s -> 4295.71s]  Alright, we got M.
[4295.71s -> 4298.46s]  Where are you coming from? I knew you were
[4298.46s -> 4301.02s]  gonna get up. M?
[4301.02s -> 4304.16s]  M? Oh
[4304.16s -> 4308.51s]  God damn it.
[4308.51s -> 4310.51s]  Okay, name tag.
[4310.51s -> 4312.51s]  We got N.
[4312.51s -> 4320.13s]  It's down to just me and three others.
[4320.13s -> 4322.13s]  No weapons, no ammo, and too many skirmishes.
[4322.13s -> 4324.13s]  Who are you? I don't care about any of this.
[4324.13s -> 4326.13s]  E. So, N, E.
[4326.13s -> 4328.94s]  N, E, D.
[4328.94s -> 4335.09s]  It is this one. Ned.
[4335.09s -> 4337.09s]  Okay.
[4337.09s -> 4341.06s]  And then this one is
[4341.06s -> 4344.50s]  M. I don't need to kill
[4344.50s -> 4351.14s]  you.
[4351.14s -> 4355.42s]  What is your name? What is your name?
[4355.42s -> 4367.25s]  Cool.
[4367.25s -> 4374.86s]  Give me the knife back.
[4374.86s -> 4376.86s]  God. Give me the knife.
[4376.86s -> 4383.12s]  It's almost broken.
[4383.12s -> 4385.62s]  Okay, that was George.
[4385.62s -> 4387.62s]  So that's G, R,
[4387.62s -> 4390.82s]  M.
[4390.82s -> 4397.02s]  George, George RR
[4397.02s -> 4403.55s]  Martin.
[4403.55s -> 4406.05s]  Open the desk. High capacity
[4406.05s -> 4408.99s]  mag. And
[4408.99s -> 4422.74s]  I have to take one of these.
[4422.74s -> 4426.32s]  I gotta take one of those herbs.
[4426.32s -> 4428.32s]  I have to. I hate that I have to do it.
[4428.32s -> 4430.32s]  I hate it. I'm gonna
[4430.32s -> 4434.48s]  No, but I can combine these.
[4434.48s -> 4438.96s]  Just do it. Fuck it.
[4438.96s -> 4453.04s]  I'm not taking any heals.
[4453.04s -> 4461.23s]  What did I do wrong?
[4461.23s -> 4468.27s]  Isn't that for a machine gun?
[4468.27s -> 4472.75s]  Alright, I'm getting out of here.
[4472.75s -> 4477.87s]  Where the fuck am I gonna go now?
[4477.87s -> 4480.50s]  Open this door. I can apparently.
[4480.50s -> 4484.21s]  It's for the pistol?
[4484.21s -> 4494.19s]  I saw the
[4494.19s -> 4496.19s]  mag and I thought it was
[4496.19s -> 4498.19s]  the gunpowder said that like
[4498.19s -> 4500.19s]  pistol and then shotgun
[4500.19s -> 4502.19s]  mag and I was like oh a mag for
[4502.19s -> 4511.90s]  fuck me.
[4511.90s -> 4513.90s]  I've only been on fucking Comcast. Not even
[4513.90s -> 4517.34s]  that's the wrong company. Okay.
[4517.34s -> 4519.34s]  It's alright though. I was gonna combine them anyways
[4519.34s -> 4522.10s]  eventually. So I can hold 24
[4522.10s -> 4526.19s]  rounds. Cool. Oh my god.
[4526.19s -> 4528.19s]  Oh my fucking
[4528.19s -> 4532.16s]  Jesus. The Olaf
[4532.16s -> 4534.16s]  just gave 50 community subs.
[4534.16s -> 4536.72s]  50. 50.
[4536.72s -> 4542.74s]  50. Gifting a moron.
[4542.74s -> 4546.51s]  I'm not a moron.
[4546.51s -> 4549.90s]  It's very dark in here.
[4549.90s -> 4551.90s]  Do you see how dark it is? You think you can read
[4551.90s -> 4559.71s]  a screen when it's this dark? Thank you
[4559.71s -> 4561.71s]  so much for the 50 community
[4561.71s -> 4564.40s]  subs. That's a shit load.
[4564.40s -> 4569.50s]  You are an idiot.
[4569.50s -> 4571.50s]  I'm like juggling so much stuff right now.
[4571.50s -> 4576.24s]  I'm juggling. I'm juggling with the fact
[4576.24s -> 4578.24s]  not only do I have my plane this game. I got a dark room.
[4578.24s -> 4581.57s]  I got an internet that's not working.
[4581.57s -> 4583.57s]  I had diarrhea this morning. Still have it.
[4583.57s -> 4585.57s]  It's coming up right now. I've been going
[4585.57s -> 4587.57s]  like this to try to keep it quiet.
[4587.57s -> 4599.34s]  Anyways. That's a huge amount of money. Thank you
[4599.34s -> 4604.08s]  so much. 209
[4604.08s -> 4606.08s]  109. I don't know what that means.
[4606.08s -> 4609.09s]  I think it's mo-
[4609.09s -> 4611.09s]  Thank you very much
[4611.09s -> 4613.58s]  first try. Got it?
[4613.58s -> 4615.58s]  Fucking Jesus man.
[4615.58s -> 4617.58s]  This 23,000 drop frames.
[4617.58s -> 4619.58s]  Should I even stop?
[4619.58s -> 4621.58s]  Should I just stop and do something else
[4621.58s -> 4623.58s]  because I don't want this to be like a lag
[4623.58s -> 4632.67s]  dog shit stream.
[4632.67s -> 4634.67s]  This is something I've been looking forward to doing for a long time.
[4634.67s -> 4639.09s]  Alright. What do we got? We got
[4639.09s -> 4641.09s]  prizes. Okay. This is 203.
[4641.09s -> 4643.52s]  I think it's missing.
[4643.52s -> 4645.52s]  208 is shotgun.
[4645.52s -> 4648.02s]  That one's already open.
[4648.02s -> 4651.20s]  109. 108.
[4651.20s -> 4654.02s]  106. Where is he?
[4654.02s -> 4656.02s]  103. 102.
[4656.02s -> 4661.84s]  I swear to God. Is there another
[4661.84s -> 4668.05s]  guy over here?
[4668.05s -> 4670.54s]  Let's do 108.
[4670.54s -> 4678.86s]  107. Which
[4678.86s -> 4680.86s]  is the one right there? 102.
[4680.86s -> 4682.86s]  102 and 103. Oh there is no
[4682.86s -> 4684.86s]  two. Okay. I need to find the two.
[4684.86s -> 4690.62s]  Can any of these other ones be
[4690.62s -> 4692.62s]  opened? 103? No. Two and three both gone.
[4692.62s -> 4694.62s]  So now these can be
[4694.62s -> 4696.62s]  opened until I get the
[4696.62s -> 4698.62s]  number off of the keyboard
[4698.62s -> 4700.62s]  or whatever the hell I have to do. What about this?
[4700.62s -> 4702.62s]  This is a weapons locker. I need a key
[4702.62s -> 4704.62s]  card. I don't have it.
[4704.62s -> 4706.62s]  There's a shotgun in there.
[4706.62s -> 4708.62s]  That's pretty amazing.
[4708.62s -> 4711.76s]  I don't think I can do much in here right now so
[4711.76s -> 4713.76s]  let's go back to...
[4713.76s -> 4725.33s]  Let me...
[4725.33s -> 4733.20s]  Give me one second.
[4733.20s -> 4735.20s]  Let me go take a piss. Let me figure
[4735.20s -> 4737.20s]  out what the hell I want to do about this because
[4737.20s -> 4739.95s]  it has not gotten better and I really
[4739.95s -> 4741.95s]  was going to give it like an hour or so. So we need to do
[4741.95s -> 4743.95s]  something else I think. Unfortunately
[4743.95s -> 4747.47s]  I'm sorry. Let me see
[4747.47s -> 4749.90s]  what else we can do. I was like praying
[4749.90s -> 4751.90s]  that this wasn't going to happen for this
[4751.90s -> 4753.90s]  long but it has so. I'll be right back. We'll figure
[4753.90s -> 4857.84s]  it out. Yeah it seems to have gotten
[4857.84s -> 4859.84s]  worse since I just left.
[4859.84s -> 4862.91s]  So I really don't know
[4862.91s -> 4864.91s]  what to do about it. All I can do
[4864.91s -> 4866.91s]  is continue to try to get
[4866.91s -> 4869.28s]  every ISP I've ever had
[4869.28s -> 4871.28s]  to fix their fucking internet.
[4871.28s -> 4873.28s]  So it's
[4873.28s -> 4878.85s]  stupid.
[4878.85s -> 4888.26s]  So I do apologize. I'm sorry.
[4888.26s -> 4890.26s]  I really was looking forward to doing Resident Evil 2
[4890.26s -> 4892.50s]  tonight. I was planning
[4892.50s -> 4896.59s]  on going for a long time.
[4896.59s -> 4900.88s]  But I don't know. Kind of at the
[4900.88s -> 4902.88s]  mercy of this
[4902.88s -> 4904.88s]  shit. So I'm really sorry guys.
[4904.88s -> 4910.32s]  I'm going to give it like another
[4910.32s -> 4912.32s]  20 to 30 minutes.
[4912.32s -> 4914.32s]  And if it's still doing it
[4914.32s -> 4916.32s]  if we still have problems
[4916.32s -> 4918.32s]  then we'll just go IRL and I'll just
[4918.32s -> 4920.32s]  hang out. We'll just chill and maybe play like
[4920.32s -> 4922.50s]  GeoGuessr or something.
[4922.50s -> 4924.50s]  Or something else. Maybe we'll just hang out for a little while.
[4924.50s -> 4926.50s]  We'll try again tomorrow.
[4926.50s -> 4928.80s]  I'm
[4928.80s -> 4930.80s]  going to also get in touch with
[4930.80s -> 4933.36s]  Cox as well. So let's see what
[4933.36s -> 4942.45s]  happens. So
[4942.45s -> 4946.22s]  so many subs came in too.
[4946.22s -> 4949.28s]  Thanks a lot guys.
[4949.28s -> 4951.28s]  Appreciate the patience.
[4951.28s -> 4953.65s]  So let me look what's over here.
[4953.65s -> 4955.65s]  Storage locker terminal memo.
[4955.65s -> 4958.14s]  It appears that the keypad to the
[4958.14s -> 4960.14s]  lockers terminal was missing a few keys. I suggested
[4960.14s -> 4962.14s]  the person responsible for this mess.
[4962.14s -> 4964.14s]  Find some spare keys and fix this
[4964.14s -> 4967.54s]  right now. Spare keys.
[4967.54s -> 4970.03s]  Interesting.
[4970.03s -> 4973.60s]  Spare keys. Wherever that would
[4973.60s -> 4982.54s]  be.
[4982.54s -> 4984.54s]  So locker terminal dark room.
[4984.54s -> 4986.54s]  How do I get to the dark room?
[4986.54s -> 4992.11s]  Jesus.
[4992.11s -> 4995.06s]  Somebody's going to come from the right side.
[4995.06s -> 5000.30s]  I just know it. What's this?
[5000.30s -> 5002.30s]  A heal.
[5002.30s -> 5007.74s]  I can take that. Let's open this.
[5007.74s -> 5009.74s]  Ooh what's that?
[5009.74s -> 5011.74s]  Wooden boards? Oh I thought there was a gun
[5011.74s -> 5014.88s]  taped to this.
[5014.88s -> 5021.02s]  Oh shit.
[5021.02s -> 5023.02s]  Is there a reason why that can be used to board up windows
[5023.02s -> 5025.02s]  keeping the rip-rap out?
[5025.02s -> 5029.82s]  Let's just eat the herb.
[5029.82s -> 5036.74s]  So should I board up this window?
[5036.74s -> 5041.47s]  I could board that window up.
[5041.47s -> 5044.93s]  I mean the board in that one. No.
[5044.93s -> 5061.31s]  I'm just going to save. Well he ain't getting it.
[5061.31s -> 5067.65s]  What is in here?
[5067.65s -> 5071.49s]  There's a save point right there.
[5071.49s -> 5075.52s]  Might as well do it.
[5075.52s -> 5079.66s]  It was that simple.
[5079.66s -> 5082.61s]  We saved.
[5082.61s -> 5084.61s]  Medicinal benefits of herbs.
[5084.61s -> 5086.61s]  Humans have used herbs to treat sickness and disease since the dawn
[5086.61s -> 5088.61s]  of time. In this book, we will
[5088.61s -> 5092.26s]  explore. No that's a plane.
[5092.26s -> 5094.26s]  That's just a plane.
[5094.26s -> 5096.50s]  I don't know why I thought that was like a bee or a
[5096.50s -> 5098.74s]  dog enemy in the game or something.
[5098.74s -> 5100.74s]  Green herbs have the ability to
[5100.74s -> 5102.74s]  heal basic injuries while blue herbs have
[5102.74s -> 5104.74s]  been used to treat poisoning.
[5104.74s -> 5106.74s]  As for red, they're very visually
[5106.74s -> 5108.74s]  appealing. They offer no
[5108.74s -> 5110.74s]  medicinal benefits or so it was thought
[5110.74s -> 5113.10s]  until recently.
[5113.10s -> 5115.79s]  It's well known that combining herbs
[5115.79s -> 5117.79s]  produces blends that heighten the herb's effects
[5117.79s -> 5119.79s]  but it's been discovered that red herbs can play a big
[5119.79s -> 5121.79s]  role when mixed properly.
[5121.79s -> 5123.79s]  Blue and red
[5123.79s -> 5125.79s]  produces a blend that will strengthen one's constitution.
[5125.79s -> 5128.99s]  Truly, we have just begun to realize
[5128.99s -> 5130.99s]  the full potential of these herbs and their ability to
[5130.99s -> 5132.99s]  heal the human body. Further research is sure to
[5132.99s -> 5134.99s]  yield even more fascinating results.
[5134.99s -> 5136.99s]  Red and blue is constitution.
[5136.99s -> 5141.78s]  Very cool.
[5141.78s -> 5143.78s]  And then you can do a triple herb, right?
[5143.78s -> 5150.99s]  Okay.
[5150.99s -> 5154.38s]  Well there's the gunpowder.
[5154.38s -> 5156.38s]  So do I hold on to...
[5156.38s -> 5158.38s]  I have such trouble playing these games
[5158.38s -> 5163.18s]  because I always want to hold on to everything.
[5163.18s -> 5170.22s]  In fact, I'm going to.
[5170.22s -> 5172.22s]  I'm going to store the herb.
[5172.22s -> 5174.59s]  No, I'm not. Store a heal.
[5174.59s -> 5178.24s]  Should have kept the damn key.
[5178.24s -> 5185.66s]  Alright, save it one more time.
[5185.66s -> 5195.71s]  Yeah, the red check mark. So wait, you got...
[5195.71s -> 5198.40s]  Yeah, everyone was...
[5198.40s -> 5200.40s]  Everybody was telling me that I could have used that key.
[5200.40s -> 5202.40s]  No, I couldn't have, but it has a red check mark on it.
[5202.40s -> 5208.34s]  See?
[5208.34s -> 5211.28s]  You can just discard it.
[5211.28s -> 5218.77s]  Okay. How do I discard it from...
[5218.77s -> 5224.85s]  Do I have to do it from here?
[5224.85s -> 5232.53s]  I'm not getting fucked with, right?
[5232.53s -> 5236.88s]  Okay, cool. Anything else in here that I need to do?
[5236.88s -> 5238.88s]  This is... This game's fucking good.
[5238.88s -> 5241.89s]  That it is...
[5241.89s -> 5245.92s]  It just is. Okay.
[5245.92s -> 5249.38s]  So we got some... I need a photo.
[5249.38s -> 5255.57s]  Photo.
[5255.57s -> 5257.57s]  We got some... Oh, this is a red herb.
[5257.57s -> 5260.19s]  Shit.
[5260.19s -> 5262.37s]  Okay.
[5262.37s -> 5264.37s]  Film contains evidence. Do not leave out.
[5264.37s -> 5269.04s]  Okay.
[5269.04s -> 5271.04s]  So I need a photo to put in here.
[5271.04s -> 5276.16s]  And wash it so I can see what it looks like.
[5276.16s -> 5279.87s]  I'm going to store that herb.
[5279.87s -> 5281.87s]  Guarantee you. I bet you a thousand dollars.
[5281.87s -> 5283.87s]  That. An hour, two, three hours
[5283.87s -> 5285.87s]  into this playthrough, that box is going to be full of shit
[5285.87s -> 5287.87s]  that I haven't used yet.
[5287.87s -> 5290.11s]  And I'm going to be like, no, no, no. I need that for later.
[5290.11s -> 5292.11s]  I'm going to need that for later.
[5292.11s -> 5294.11s]  Later's going to come on. Dude, are you going to combine the red herbs and the blue herbs?
[5294.11s -> 5296.11s]  No, no. I might need them.
[5296.11s -> 5298.11s]  I think I'm going to need them later.
[5298.11s -> 5300.11s]  They're going to see the credits.
[5300.11s -> 5302.11s]  The credits are going to roll.
[5302.11s -> 5304.11s]  And you're going to say, dude, you never used
[5304.11s -> 5306.11s]  those blue and red herbs.
[5306.11s -> 5308.11s]  Yeah, but I knew game plus, man. It's going to be important when I need those.
[5308.11s -> 5314.19s]  I'll never use them.
[5314.19s -> 5316.19s]  So let's take a look at the map.
[5316.19s -> 5320.67s]  Item box, dark room, sink.
[5320.67s -> 5322.67s]  All right. There's so much to explore.
[5322.67s -> 5325.42s]  I can't go into
[5325.42s -> 5327.42s]  these rooms yet.
[5327.42s -> 5329.73s]  So we're going to have to take a...
[5329.73s -> 5331.73s]  Let's see. Where do I go from here?
[5331.73s -> 5333.73s]  Fuse box, entrance. How the fuck?
[5333.73s -> 5335.73s]  Upstairs, maybe?
[5335.73s -> 5339.95s]  Because they're going to bang a left and then maybe...
[5339.95s -> 5341.95s]  Oh, up the stairs. There's a stair.
[5341.95s -> 5348.22s]  I remember these stairs from the
[5348.22s -> 5367.81s]  original game. He can't open
[5367.81s -> 5370.56s]  the door, right? Gas. Dion.
[5370.56s -> 5379.18s]  Nothing. Shotgun shells.
[5379.18s -> 5381.18s]  Store room.
[5381.18s -> 5388.02s]  Portable safe.
[5388.02s -> 5390.02s]  A small portable safe. What the fuck am I going to do with that?
[5390.02s -> 5392.19s]  Portable safe instructions.
[5392.19s -> 5395.78s]  Press a button to
[5395.78s -> 5397.78s]  light up its corresponding lamp.
[5397.78s -> 5399.78s]  Yes, I'm like itching my ear. Sometimes when I have to think hard,
[5399.78s -> 5401.78s]  I go like this and itch in my
[5401.78s -> 5403.78s]  ear. Press a button to light up its
[5403.78s -> 5405.78s]  corresponding lamp. Then light them
[5405.78s -> 5407.78s]  all to open the safe.
[5407.78s -> 5409.78s]  The buttons must be pressed in a certain order. Pressing a single
[5409.78s -> 5411.78s]  button out of order will cause all
[5411.78s -> 5413.78s]  the lights to go out and you will need to start the
[5413.78s -> 5415.78s]  sequence over again.
[5415.78s -> 5420.62s]  Okay.
[5420.62s -> 5426.32s]  Press them in an order.
[5426.32s -> 5428.32s]  Examining items from different angles.
[5428.32s -> 5431.78s]  You can examine and spin it around.
[5431.78s -> 5434.59s]  Okay. So.
[5434.59s -> 5451.36s]  Let's go. Certain order.
[5451.36s -> 5453.36s]  Okay, okay, okay. Top right, bottom right.
[5453.36s -> 5462.30s]  Top right, top right, bottom right,
[5462.30s -> 5466.46s]  top left.
[5466.46s -> 5493.26s]  Yeah!
[5493.26s -> 5497.30s]  Ooh. Spare key.
[5497.30s -> 5500.94s]  What number is it? One?
[5500.94s -> 5507.47s]  Oh, it doesn't matter what it is. Okay.
[5507.47s -> 5509.47s]  One way to turn off that gas, right?
[5509.47s -> 5512.86s]  D.
[5512.86s -> 5515.04s]  D, D, D, D, D, D!
[5515.04s -> 5517.04s]  No, that was, I didn't even need to do that.
[5517.04s -> 5520.88s]  Shit. It's all right.
[5520.88s -> 5525.10s]  Oh.
[5525.10s -> 5527.10s]  I just shot for no reason. Okay.
[5527.10s -> 5529.86s]  Turn the gas off.
[5529.86s -> 5531.86s]  I don't have anything to do that with, but I do have the key
[5531.86s -> 5533.86s]  now. I can probably get something.
[5533.86s -> 5535.86s]  Let me go store. No.
[5535.86s -> 5540.66s]  No, don't even walk through it. You can't.
[5540.66s -> 5543.41s]  Let's go back to
[5543.41s -> 5545.41s]  the main room.
[5545.41s -> 5547.71s]  Ooh, what's this? Handgun ammo?
[5547.71s -> 5551.23s]  Really?
[5551.23s -> 5559.49s]  Come on. Don't like
[5559.49s -> 5561.49s]  bait me here. Just cut, just,
[5561.49s -> 5569.94s]  just get in here. I don't need to fight
[5569.94s -> 5571.94s]  this guy. I don't need to fight anybody.
[5571.94s -> 5576.03s]  Oh my god. Another fifty dollars just
[5576.03s -> 5578.53s]  came in. Let me go back to the
[5578.53s -> 5580.77s]  fifty dollars
[5580.77s -> 5585.23s]  from, from
[5585.23s -> 5587.41s]  Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.
[5587.41s -> 5590.54s]  Thank you so much for fifty bucks.
[5590.54s -> 5592.78s]  Uh, going off my last
[5592.78s -> 5594.78s]  update. My friend says he's getting more calls,
[5594.78s -> 5596.78s]  but they're already calling back telling him that they're
[5596.78s -> 5598.78s]  fixed. He was also hoping to play
[5598.78s -> 5600.78s]  Resident Evil 2, uh,
[5600.78s -> 5602.78s]  the remake tonight. And apologies to you
[5602.78s -> 5604.78s]  for working with people who don't know what
[5604.78s -> 5607.09s]  they're working with. Love you,
[5607.09s -> 5610.42s]  man. Thank you for the fifty
[5610.42s -> 5613.49s]  dollars. Thank you so much. It's a lot
[5613.49s -> 5615.49s]  of money. It's so much
[5615.49s -> 5617.49s]  money. You guys have given so much.
[5617.49s -> 5619.49s]  But, no, and the thing with
[5619.49s -> 5621.98s]  uh, Cox is fixed.
[5621.98s -> 5623.98s]  Yeah, but like it should, I shouldn't have to
[5623.98s -> 5625.98s]  be like this. It
[5625.98s -> 5628.93s]  shouldn't be like this. It shouldn't be
[5628.93s -> 5630.93s]  seriously like every other stream be throwing dice
[5630.93s -> 5632.93s]  in the air to see if I'm gonna be able to turn a stream on.
[5632.93s -> 5634.93s]  You know what I mean? I think it just shouldn't be like that.
[5634.93s -> 5636.93s]  And now I, I mentioned it by name
[5636.93s -> 5641.66s]  and I just dropped a frame. Turn the
[5641.66s -> 5643.66s]  lights on in my room. Oh, here.
[5643.66s -> 5648.21s]  It is getting too dark now.
[5648.21s -> 5657.23s]  There, see? That's like
[5657.23s -> 5661.39s]  fine. That's like still okay.
[5661.39s -> 5665.49s]  It doesn't have to be like this.
[5665.49s -> 5670.67s]  No, it really doesn't. It's
[5670.67s -> 5672.85s]  just companies
[5672.85s -> 5674.85s]  loading on as
[5674.85s -> 5676.85s]  many subscriptions as they can.
[5676.85s -> 5678.85s]  And not caring about anything
[5678.85s -> 5680.85s]  but a bottom line. When you
[5680.85s -> 5682.85s]  just dump as many
[5682.85s -> 5684.85s]  possible customers as you possibly
[5684.85s -> 5686.85s]  can, you don't, it doesn't matter.
[5686.85s -> 5689.41s]  Now we need to go to the dark room.
[5689.41s -> 5691.41s]  No, no, no, no, no. The uh, safety deposit room.
[5691.41s -> 5698.56s]  Uh, so I got a new key.
[5698.56s -> 5700.56s]  Let me.
[5700.56s -> 5702.56s]  Fucking God, I forgot this guy. You know, I'm
[5702.56s -> 5704.56s]  using some bullets. I can.
[5704.56s -> 5713.39s]  Like, I'm gonna use a couple of bullets here. I don't wanna
[5713.39s -> 5717.15s]  deal with this guy anymore. Okay.
[5717.15s -> 5719.15s]  So I have a spare key.
[5719.15s -> 5721.33s]  I could do 202, which looks
[5721.33s -> 5723.57s]  like some kind of fanny pack.
[5723.57s -> 5725.57s]  208,
[5725.57s -> 5727.57s]  which is shotgun bullets.
[5727.57s -> 5730.13s]  And then I need a key card for this.
[5730.13s -> 5732.13s]  So, should I do fanny pack or what's the
[5732.13s -> 5734.69s]  109, 106?
[5734.69s -> 5736.69s]  Uh, so something I didn't do.
[5736.69s -> 5739.44s]  Okay, we'll get that.
[5739.44s -> 5741.44s]  102, 103 is another knife.
[5741.44s -> 5743.44s]  No, we didn't do two.
[5743.44s -> 5746.13s]  How can you still be alive
[5746.13s -> 5748.30s]  after that? No way.
[5748.30s -> 5754.19s]  Just stay down.
[5754.19s -> 5759.25s]  Holy shit. Okay.
[5759.25s -> 5762.64s]  Put on, put it on two.
[5762.64s -> 5767.55s]  Uh, on two.
[5767.55s -> 5769.55s]  And then we need to do 20,
[5769.55s -> 5771.55s]  203. Oh fuck,
[5771.55s -> 5773.55s]  I can't open that. 20,
[5773.55s -> 5784.48s]  208.
[5784.48s -> 5789.34s]  208, 106.
[5789.34s -> 5793.25s]  106. Except that looks like a battery.
[5793.25s -> 5796.26s]  And then I think,
[5796.26s -> 5798.26s]  I don't know what the other ones are.
[5798.26s -> 5800.26s]  Let's just get these.
[5800.26s -> 5802.26s]  208, open it up.
[5802.26s -> 5805.52s]  More shotgun ammo, good.
[5805.52s -> 5809.42s]  And then 206,
[5809.42s -> 5811.42s]  which is, what the hell is this?
[5811.42s -> 5813.42s]  Ooh.
[5813.42s -> 5818.46s]  It's a roll of film.
[5818.46s -> 5823.65s]  Back to the dark room.
[5823.65s -> 5825.65s]  Can I open this one? 103, no.
[5825.65s -> 5827.65s]  102 can be opened. Let's get it.
[5827.65s -> 5837.63s]  Which is gunpowder.
[5837.63s -> 5841.28s]  Alright, back to the dark room.
[5841.28s -> 5843.90s]  And the storage box, I'm gonna burp.
[5843.90s -> 5847.28s]  Okay.
[5847.28s -> 5849.52s]  Uh, so, wrap around
[5849.52s -> 5851.52s]  the left.
[5851.52s -> 5861.86s]  Right. Okay.
[5861.86s -> 5863.86s]  Dark room, and the storage box, good.
[5863.86s -> 5866.54s]  Bah, bah, bah.
[5866.54s -> 5868.54s]  What happened? What happened?
[5868.54s -> 5874.88s]  Why is everybody saying bah?
[5874.88s -> 5876.88s]  Got three gunpowders, gonna hold on
[5876.88s -> 5878.88s]  to them. Store the shotgun shells
[5878.88s -> 5880.88s]  because I don't have a shotgun yet, and maybe eventually
[5880.88s -> 5882.88s]  I will, but not right now.
[5882.88s -> 5886.14s]  And then we get the film. Bunch of sheep.
[5886.14s -> 5888.14s]  Bah, bah, bah.
[5888.14s -> 5895.25s]  Film canister, let's give it a try.
[5895.25s -> 5899.09s]  Use.
[5899.09s -> 5901.09s]  Okay, it's a king. Commemorative photo.
[5901.09s -> 5910.10s]  I don't get it. Is the king
[5910.10s -> 5915.34s]  with a book in his hand?
[5915.34s -> 5917.34s]  Move the camera so we can see the bullets. Oh, that's a good idea.
[5917.34s -> 5919.90s]  You're right. You are absolutely
[5919.90s -> 5931.73s]  right. See, there we go.
[5931.73s -> 5936.14s]  Okay, uh.
[5936.14s -> 5938.14s]  Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[5938.14s -> 5943.07s]  Uh, that looks okay. Alright.
[5943.07s -> 5947.23s]  So, uh, I got
[5947.23s -> 5949.23s]  a picture of the king.
[5949.23s -> 5954.22s]  Whatever that means. Let me look at
[5954.22s -> 5958.45s]  that again. So, it's
[5958.45s -> 5960.45s]  a picture of a king with a crown
[5960.45s -> 5962.45s]  and a scepter and a book.
[5962.45s -> 5967.06s]  I can't move it around. I can't flip it.
[5967.06s -> 5971.41s]  That's just what it looks like. Alright.
[5971.41s -> 5973.41s]  Oh, that's good to know. Where was
[5973.41s -> 5975.90s]  that? Was there a
[5975.90s -> 5977.90s]  guy with a book that I
[5977.90s -> 5982.51s]  missed? Not the statue.
[5982.51s -> 5985.07s]  It's the Burger King.
[5985.07s -> 5989.36s]  The Burger King.
[5989.36s -> 5991.92s]  Alright, so it looks like
[5991.92s -> 5993.92s]  there's some windows down here. Operations room
[5993.92s -> 5995.92s]  maybe, but I can't go through there.
[5995.92s -> 5999.38s]  Now I can't see health. Re.
[5999.38s -> 6003.71s]  Uh,
[6003.71s -> 6012.99s]  I don't know if there's anywhere I can go.
[6012.99s -> 6014.99s]  Let me go back.
[6014.99s -> 6017.68s]  Uh, any new keys or anything?
[6017.68s -> 6022.16s]  Let me see. Maybe back upstairs?
[6022.16s -> 6024.96s]  Just keep your face
[6024.96s -> 6026.96s]  always over Leon's.
[6026.96s -> 6029.33s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[6029.33s -> 6033.49s]  That's not right. There's a safe
[6033.49s -> 6035.49s]  in there. There's a couple of saves.
[6035.49s -> 6038.30s]  Fuse box. I don't have a fuse box. Maybe
[6038.30s -> 6040.30s]  up here, no. Bathroom?
[6040.30s -> 6042.74s]  Break room? Watchman's
[6042.74s -> 6044.74s]  room, maybe? This is
[6044.74s -> 6047.81s]  maybe over here.
[6047.81s -> 6051.39s]  Put the cam in the corner.
[6051.39s -> 6056.58s]  Oh, we have...
[6056.58s -> 6058.58s]  ...
[6058.58s -> 6060.58s]  Oh, olive oil!
[6060.58s -> 6065.82s]  ...
[6065.82s -> 6072.67s]  Handgun bullets. Nobody knows what that is.
[6072.67s -> 6075.42s]  I'm just too old.
[6075.42s -> 6077.98s]  That's Popeye the Sailor Man.
[6077.98s -> 6079.98s]  That's just showing my age. I really am getting too
[6079.98s -> 6086.00s]  old, I think.
[6086.00s -> 6099.50s]  I don't know what the fuck that is.
[6099.50s -> 6102.38s]  Ooh! The key, the spade key.
[6102.38s -> 6109.04s]  Now we have so many more doors to open.
[6109.04s -> 6112.05s]  Nothing I can do with the, uh,
[6112.05s -> 6120.62s]  mannequin thing? Okay. What's this?
[6120.62s -> 6122.62s]  Dial lock? I can't do anything about it.
[6122.62s -> 6124.86s]  I need to find a map of this area.
[6127.42s -> 6139.18s]  What in the...
[6139.18s -> 6151.09s]  Persephire Lung? No.
[6151.09s -> 6153.09s]  To any survivors, consider this a gift
[6153.09s -> 6155.09s]  to anyone still unfortunate enough to be alive.
[6155.09s -> 6157.09s]  Keep your eyes peeled for those
[6157.09s -> 6159.09s]  creepy fucks that look like they
[6159.09s -> 6161.09s]  were skinned alive. Liquors, we call
[6161.09s -> 6163.09s]  them. They're blind as bats, but they're hearing
[6163.09s -> 6165.09s]  more than makes up for that. I forgot about the other
[6165.09s -> 6167.09s]  enemies in this game. There are, like, spiders.
[6167.09s -> 6169.09s]  There are liquors. There are...
[6169.09s -> 6171.26s]  So as long as you don't run around like a total idiot
[6171.26s -> 6173.26s]  guns blazing, you should be able to slip right by
[6173.26s -> 6175.26s]  them, probably. Either way, make
[6175.26s -> 6177.26s]  like my grandma and creep around
[6177.26s -> 6179.26s]  as slow as possible.
[6179.26s -> 6181.26s]  Anyway, not that I want to go, but duty calls
[6181.26s -> 6183.26s]  that, and I got a friend to avenge. David.
[6183.26s -> 6188.06s]  I gotta be quiet
[6188.06s -> 6190.06s]  and they're blind.
[6190.06s -> 6193.26s]  Now I'm gonna turn around, there's gonna be one behind
[6193.26s -> 6196.53s]  me. What's the sneak
[6196.53s -> 6199.02s]  button? There is no sneak button.
[6199.02s -> 6220.85s]  Yes, I apologize for the E3
[6220.85s -> 6222.85s]  demo, but I just got the
[6222.85s -> 6224.85s]  word that they're here, so...
[6224.85s -> 6266.00s]  I need you back here ASAP. Are you okay,
[6266.00s -> 6268.00s]  Martin? Back to the main hall?
[6268.00s -> 6270.00s]  I've got something to show you. It's important.
[6270.00s -> 6272.00s]  Copy that. I'll be right there. I like like a dirty
[6272.00s -> 6274.00s]  version of the original Leon.
[6274.00s -> 6281.54s]  Hey, thanks. Can I do
[6281.54s -> 6284.74s]  a Dark Souls free jump?
[6284.74s -> 6287.81s]  I guess not. Alright.
[6287.81s -> 6289.81s]  So much to look at. So much to explore.
[6289.81s -> 6294.67s]  Alright, so far I'm gonna give my first
[6294.67s -> 6297.04s]  impressions.
[6297.04s -> 6299.04s]  Kind of bad game.
[6299.04s -> 6305.50s]  I was gonna make...
[6305.50s -> 6307.50s]  It's a great game. Never mind.
[6307.50s -> 6309.50s]  Never mind. I go back
[6309.50s -> 6311.50s]  on everything I just said.
[6311.50s -> 6315.86s]  Where am I? The library? What's this?
[6315.86s -> 6317.86s]  There's a jack.
[6317.86s -> 6334.74s]  Red book! Hold on, I...
[6334.74s -> 6337.49s]  So at some point I gotta start fighting.
[6337.49s -> 6339.49s]  You know what I mean? This can't just be like a passive
[6339.49s -> 6341.49s]  playthrough.
[6341.49s -> 6351.78s]  Is he ever gonna not land a headshot?
[6351.78s -> 6369.95s]  What do you think, guys?
[6369.95s -> 6371.95s]  I mean, headshots only we're talking about. Okay,
[6371.95s -> 6378.98s]  jack this up. Fuck.
[6378.98s -> 6380.98s]  Where can I go with this? Over? Left? Right?
[6380.98s -> 6390.26s]  Can I not say I can move this one? Why can I not move
[6390.26s -> 6392.50s]  the other one?
[6392.50s -> 6396.21s]  Hey!
[6396.21s -> 6399.15s]  What do you do?
[6399.15s -> 6401.15s]  Only headshots we're talking about, guys.
[6401.15s -> 6404.42s]  I'm sorry.
[6404.42s -> 6406.42s]  So this shit in the way. I can't do it. I gotta jack that
[6406.42s -> 6412.88s]  up first. Okay.
[6412.88s -> 6416.02s]  I need that book! What can I do
[6416.02s -> 6422.74s]  here? The boards? The window
[6422.74s -> 6427.73s]  boards? Just get rid of them?
[6427.73s -> 6429.97s]  Maybe I can just get rid of the boards.
[6429.97s -> 6431.97s]  I could come back. Yeah, come back for it.
[6431.97s -> 6433.97s]  I got the key right. Yeah, that's right. That's right.
[6433.97s -> 6435.97s]  You got the right. I think it's fine.
[6435.97s -> 6437.97s]  The door's right here.
[6437.97s -> 6445.33s]  Back to the main hall.
[6445.33s -> 6447.33s]  That's so cool.
[6447.33s -> 6449.33s]  Just one giant puzzle.
[6449.33s -> 6456.94s]  I got the storage boxes right here.
[6462.72s -> 6466.88s]  Who is that?
[6469.31s -> 6471.31s]  I have no idea who that is.
[6473.68s -> 6475.68s]  Claire?
[6475.68s -> 6477.68s]  Claire.
[6477.68s -> 6479.68s]  I don't know. It doesn't ring a bell.
[6484.86s -> 6488.96s]  Dude, make a new meme
[6488.96s -> 6490.96s]  or riot. That's not how it works.
[6490.96s -> 6492.96s]  You don't just create a
[6492.96s -> 6494.96s]  meme because you feel like having a new meme.
[6494.96s -> 6496.96s]  That's not how it works.
[6496.96s -> 6498.96s]  That would not be a true new meme.
[6498.96s -> 6502.10s]  It wouldn't at all.
[6502.10s -> 6505.02s]  Alright. Gunpowder.
[6505.02s -> 6507.02s]  Keep the key.
[6507.02s -> 6509.02s]  Keep a couple of heals.
[6509.02s -> 6511.02s]  The boards. I mean
[6511.02s -> 6513.20s]  I don't
[6513.20s -> 6515.20s]  For now, I guess I don't know what to do with them.
[6515.20s -> 6519.42s]  Make a new meme or I'm unsubbing.
[6519.42s -> 6523.20s]  Nobody is ever required
[6523.20s -> 6525.20s]  to be subscribed to the channel.
[6525.20s -> 6527.50s]  I'm sorry. If you don't deem this channel
[6527.50s -> 6529.50s]  necessary to subscribe to and pay for
[6529.50s -> 6531.50s]  that's on you.
[6531.50s -> 6533.50s]  I can't tell you otherwise.
[6533.50s -> 6535.50s]  But if you're looking for a fresh new meme in
[6535.50s -> 6537.50s]  2019, you're going to miss it if you unsubscribe.
[6537.50s -> 6540.38s]  Okay. Let's go back here and get the book.
[6540.38s -> 6545.63s]  Claire's alive.
[6545.63s -> 6547.63s]  That's good to know.
[6547.63s -> 6552.29s]  Give me the book.
[6552.29s -> 6554.85s]  Streamer doesn't care about his fans.
[6554.85s -> 6560.29s]  Wait, this is the wrong, wait, wrong.
[6560.29s -> 6563.81s]  But also
[6563.81s -> 6569.44s]  different. This is the offices.
[6569.44s -> 6573.15s]  I don't know the safe combination.
[6573.15s -> 6576.10s]  So
[6576.10s -> 6578.10s]  anything else in here? Yeah, this is the safe
[6578.10s -> 6580.10s]  spring. Okay, yeah.
[6580.10s -> 6584.26s]  This is just a quicker way to get through here.
[6584.26s -> 6586.26s]  My meme stocks are dropping.
[6586.26s -> 6588.26s]  No, they're not. They're doing just fine.
[6588.26s -> 6590.26s]  Look,
[6590.26s -> 6592.26s]  it's alright. We're supposed to go through
[6592.26s -> 6594.94s]  a meme correction.
[6594.94s -> 6596.94s]  Our memes went parabolic in 2018.
[6596.94s -> 6601.81s]  There needs to be a correction.
[6601.81s -> 6609.62s]  Okay, so this is the book.
[6609.62s -> 6612.50s]  So who?
[6612.50s -> 6614.50s]  Who needs this book?
[6614.50s -> 6616.50s]  Is somebody in the main hall? Let me go look.
[6616.50s -> 6625.18s]  A handgun ammo
[6625.18s -> 6627.42s]  is in there somewhere.
[6627.42s -> 6629.42s]  Alright, waiting room, safe.
[6629.42s -> 6631.42s]  And then here's a spade door
[6631.42s -> 6633.42s]  on the other side of the waiting room. Let's go look at it.
[6633.42s -> 6635.60s]  But first, let's go
[6635.60s -> 6637.60s]  find there. Okay, is that the
[6637.60s -> 6640.48s]  Liberty that needs a book?
[6640.48s -> 6645.22s]  Where's the Burger King guy?
[6645.22s -> 6652.38s]  That's not the Burger King.
[6652.38s -> 6656.86s]  Where is the Burger King guy?
[6656.86s -> 6660.51s]  And here? No, this is like the
[6660.51s -> 6663.90s]  press room. No.
[6663.90s -> 6670.18s]  Alright, well let's just go open the
[6670.18s -> 6674.40s]  there's so much over here. Let's go open
[6674.40s -> 6677.47s]  the spade door that's over there.
[6677.47s -> 6679.47s]  So we can go back up. Save the game.
[6679.47s -> 6687.09s]  I'm back. Did you make a new meme yet?
[6687.09s -> 6690.35s]  Yeah, you missed it.
[6690.35s -> 6692.35s]  Nobody should repeat it either
[6692.35s -> 6694.35s]  because, I mean, come on.
[6694.35s -> 6698.58s]  We've got to keep that one secret for now.
[6698.58s -> 6700.88s]  Here's the spade door over
[6700.88s -> 6704.27s]  this way. Let's go check it out.
[6704.27s -> 6706.27s]  You missed it. I'm sorry.
[6706.27s -> 6709.92s]  Okay, new place.
[6709.92s -> 6715.30s]  Is somebody on the other side
[6715.30s -> 6717.73s]  of this door? I think.
[6717.73s -> 6724.83s]  Organize items.
[6724.83s -> 6727.78s]  You can discard items that have served
[6727.78s -> 6729.78s]  their purpose or any other key items with a check mark
[6729.78s -> 6731.78s]  by selecting discard. So that's it.
[6731.78s -> 6735.30s]  That's all the spade doors.
[6735.30s -> 6737.30s]  I can't do that though.
[6737.30s -> 6740.24s]  I'm just so attached to it already.
[6740.24s -> 6742.24s]  If I get rid of this, then
[6742.24s -> 6744.24s]  I can't have my, like, three key
[6744.24s -> 6754.54s]  collection. Okay.
[6754.54s -> 6762.80s]  I had to. Alright, we got two ways to go here.
[6762.80s -> 6765.10s]  Let's just try up here.
[6765.10s -> 6767.10s]  Do I have any boards? No.
[6767.10s -> 6769.10s]  Are there windows?
[6769.10s -> 6773.26s]  They might be a window, so just take it.
[6773.26s -> 6779.39s]  What's this do?
[6779.39s -> 6781.39s]  Okay, I need a crank.
[6781.39s -> 6786.19s]  I don't have a crank.
[6786.19s -> 6791.25s]  Art room. There's the king.
[6791.25s -> 6795.41s]  Nope, there's the king.
[6795.41s -> 6799.18s]  An article, the red stone.
[6799.18s -> 6801.18s]  The ruby that captivated Edward, the black
[6801.18s -> 6803.18s]  prince, the pearl that the queen of the Nile
[6803.18s -> 6805.18s]  milked dry. The diamond that led
[6805.18s -> 6807.18s]  a queen to the guillotine. There is
[6807.18s -> 6809.18s]  no end to the numbers of tales related to the
[6809.18s -> 6811.18s]  appeal of jewels.
[6811.18s -> 6813.18s]  The mysterious red stone is the latest to sparkle
[6813.18s -> 6815.18s]  among them. Like those other jewels,
[6815.18s -> 6817.18s]  this one's origin is unknown.
[6817.18s -> 6819.18s]  It's sad that it
[6819.18s -> 6821.18s]  once adorned a noble man,
[6821.18s -> 6823.18s]  noble woman's jeweled box, and was even dedicated
[6823.18s -> 6825.18s]  to a wise king. This
[6825.18s -> 6827.18s]  fall, this stone that's long been
[6827.18s -> 6829.18s]  shrouded in legacy will be on display
[6829.18s -> 6831.18s]  during auction. There are sure to
[6831.18s -> 6833.18s]  be many eager enthusiasts
[6833.18s -> 6835.18s]  there, but dear reader, one would do well to
[6835.18s -> 6837.18s]  approach with care and to
[6837.18s -> 6839.18s]  read this on another rainy day.
[6839.18s -> 6841.81s]  Shotgun.
[6841.81s -> 6844.37s]  Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.
[6844.37s -> 6846.37s]  Alright, we've been going for like another 20
[6846.37s -> 6849.25s]  or 30 minutes. We good?
[6849.25s -> 6851.68s]  Internet fucking normal, kind
[6851.68s -> 6859.04s]  of? How are we doing?
[6859.04s -> 6863.18s]  Okay? Okay.
[6863.18s -> 6865.18s]  We'll just move on. We're not
[6865.18s -> 6867.94s]  going to talk about it, but thank you
[6867.94s -> 6869.94s]  for your patience. I really appreciate it.
[6869.94s -> 6872.37s]  There are like 3600 people here.
[6872.37s -> 6874.37s]  I'm fucking grateful and thankful for your
[6874.37s -> 6876.67s]  patience. Thank you.
[6876.67s -> 6879.42s]  Alright, so let's go. Now
[6879.42s -> 6881.42s]  I can give the Burger King his
[6881.42s -> 6883.42s]  Burger King late night menu.
[6883.42s -> 6888.16s]  What's that? King's hand.
[6888.16s -> 6895.65s]  A piece of plastic shaped
[6895.65s -> 6897.65s]  like a book. It looks like it was being held by
[6897.65s -> 6900.53s]  a hand. So this is bullshit.
[6900.53s -> 6902.53s]  This is just a replica.
[6902.53s -> 6906.35s]  This is a perfect copy.
[6906.35s -> 6912.69s]  Okay. Why can I
[6912.69s -> 6914.69s]  combine with hand?
[6914.69s -> 6918.38s]  Oh. Statue's left arm.
[6918.38s -> 6922.40s]  Fucking
[6922.40s -> 6925.28s]  wood. Can I just go find a window
[6925.28s -> 6937.25s]  to pour it up? Raid?
[6937.25s -> 6943.20s]  We got a raid? Combine
[6943.20s -> 6945.20s]  it with the book. Can you do it from the menu?
[6945.20s -> 6950.64s]  Who just came in with a raid?
[6950.64s -> 6960.62s]  Oh, I did.
[6960.62s -> 6962.62s]  No, it was all shit. It was
[6962.62s -> 6967.74s]  sham. Shamwow.
[6967.74s -> 6971.25s]  Thanks a lot, dude.
[6971.25s -> 6973.25s]  We haven't talked in a while. We got to like fix that.
[6973.25s -> 6977.47s]  We got to fix that. That's something we got to fix.
[6977.47s -> 6979.47s]  But thank you so much for the raid. Hope you
[6979.47s -> 6989.01s]  had a good stream. I thought
[6989.01s -> 6991.01s]  that they lived. Wait, you thought me and all
[6991.01s -> 6993.01s]  sham? No, we didn't live together.
[6993.01s -> 6999.39s]  What? Alright, but
[6999.39s -> 7001.89s]  thanks a lot, man. Welcome everybody.
[7001.89s -> 7004.26s]  I'm in the process of like, did you
[7004.26s -> 7014.56s]  play in Resident Evil? I can't believe
[7014.56s -> 7016.56s]  Mark's moving in with Jermo.
[7016.56s -> 7021.62s]  Oh, Diablo II
[7021.62s -> 7023.62s]  Paladin Shepter.
[7023.62s -> 7027.46s]  How's that for a reference
[7027.46s -> 7029.46s]  to a 2018 parabolic meme?
[7029.46s -> 7037.65s]  I'm getting minus two for that one. That's
[7037.65s -> 7039.65s]  a reference to 2016, which was then
[7039.65s -> 7041.65s]  revitalized in 2018.
[7041.65s -> 7043.65s]  No, sorry, 2014, which was revitalized
[7043.65s -> 7045.65s]  in 2016. And I'm referencing
[7045.65s -> 7047.65s]  a revitalized meme. That's how you know
[7047.65s -> 7049.65s]  our memes are parabolic and we've got to fucking change something
[7049.65s -> 7052.08s]  about that. Don't
[7052.08s -> 7054.08s]  sell those anymore. Don't buy those. Don't buy
[7054.08s -> 7056.08s]  any more fucking 700,000 games memes.
[7056.08s -> 7058.08s]  They're not going to be worth anything in like six months.
[7058.08s -> 7067.62s]  Alright, so now I got
[7067.62s -> 7069.62s]  the Scepter.
[7069.62s -> 7071.62s]  Now what the hell is you supposed to do with the Scepter?
[7071.62s -> 7077.12s]  Nothing else in here. No secrets.
[7077.12s -> 7083.44s]  Okay, let's go.
[7083.44s -> 7098.61s]  A jewel for your Scepter. I got a
[7098.61s -> 7101.04s]  jewel. Can I put that in the
[7101.04s -> 7104.82s]  gun? Can I like add that to
[7104.82s -> 7108.02s]  my gun to make it look cool?
[7108.02s -> 7110.58s]  Sell it. Alright, what's over here?
[7110.58s -> 7112.58s]  We have the crank that's over
[7112.58s -> 7114.58s]  here. Wait, is that a gem? Do you put a gem
[7114.58s -> 7116.58s]  in there? No, it's a crank. I don't have it.
[7116.58s -> 7119.46s]  I have a laser red dot sight.
[7119.46s -> 7122.08s]  We've gone to the art
[7122.08s -> 7124.08s]  room. There's the waiting room here.
[7124.08s -> 7126.08s]  The safe is in here. Let's just
[7126.08s -> 7128.64s]  keep moving down here. I got
[7128.64s -> 7132.80s]  full bullets.
[7132.80s -> 7136.51s]  Wait, you're fucking driving.
[7136.51s -> 7139.14s]  That guy, I don't even know how you got there.
[7139.14s -> 7142.59s]  Somebody just GTA'd over a stunt
[7142.59s -> 7152.96s]  jump and landed into the wall. I don't have
[7152.96s -> 7159.55s]  enough room for this. Alright, I got a super
[7159.55s -> 7163.20s]  herb. Hey, I got a superb
[7163.20s -> 7179.65s]  helicopter.
[7179.65s -> 7184.18s]  Claire?
[7184.18s -> 7188.00s]  You've
[7188.00s -> 7190.00s]  been standing at that door for a
[7190.00s -> 7192.00s]  long time. Alright, in the Claire playthrough
[7192.00s -> 7194.00s]  do you stand there for 40 minutes?
[7194.00s -> 7202.24s]  Claire, it's so nice to see you.
[7202.24s -> 7204.42s]  How are you doing? That helicopter
[7204.42s -> 7206.42s]  just came out of nowhere.
[7206.42s -> 7208.72s]  One piece. I'm guessing
[7208.72s -> 7210.72s]  you don't have a key in one of those fancy
[7210.72s -> 7212.72s]  pockets? Unfortunately,
[7212.72s -> 7214.72s]  no. Come on, am I gonna
[7214.72s -> 7216.96s]  do a joke here?
[7216.96s -> 7218.96s]  Grab the gate and go,
[7218.96s -> 7220.96s]  pretend you're a zombie. They had an opportunity
[7220.96s -> 7222.96s]  to make that joke. Any luck with your brother?
[7222.96s -> 7225.52s]  No, not yet. Claire,
[7225.52s -> 7227.52s]  don't lose hope. I'm sure
[7227.52s -> 7235.65s]  we're gonna find him. You know what
[7235.65s -> 7237.65s]  that means. Yeah,
[7237.65s -> 7243.97s]  our time. Claire, I think we should go. Don't worry about me,
[7243.97s -> 7245.97s]  Leon. You take care
[7245.97s -> 7249.04s]  of yourself.
[7249.04s -> 7251.66s]  You need to go, now.
[7251.66s -> 7255.57s]  Okay, let's get through
[7255.57s -> 7257.57s]  this, both of us.
[7257.57s -> 7266.46s]  Marvin, I've got a situation here.
[7266.46s -> 7268.46s]  I can't really climb that. I'm surrounded by zombies.
[7268.46s -> 7270.46s]  Marvin, do you
[7270.46s -> 7272.46s]  copy? Marvin? Marvin!
[7272.46s -> 7274.46s]  I don't think Marvin's alive.
[7274.46s -> 7276.46s]  Alright, cutting tool. Ah!
[7276.46s -> 7279.73s]  God damn it!
[7279.73s -> 7282.61s]  The stupid wooden boards!
[7282.61s -> 7284.61s]  I agree. Can I just
[7284.61s -> 7286.61s]  board this up?
[7286.61s -> 7293.14s]  This ammo, too. More
[7293.14s -> 7315.28s]  boards!
[7315.28s -> 7317.28s]  I don't need the boards. This is a boardless
[7317.28s -> 7322.08s]  playthrough. This is a real
[7322.08s -> 7324.08s]  board playthrough. I know, yeah.
[7324.08s -> 7326.08s]  Lots of action going on.
[7328.08s -> 7331.98s]  Headshots only! Got it.
[7331.98s -> 7348.29s]  No!
[7348.29s -> 7350.29s]  Give me the knife. What the fuck? I thought he was...
[7350.29s -> 7353.04s]  Honest to God, how many times do I have to shoot you in the head?
[7353.04s -> 7356.88s]  Fucking bozo.
[7356.88s -> 7360.66s]  Alright, uh, so that is...
[7360.66s -> 7362.66s]  That's good.
[7362.66s -> 7364.66s]  Back to...
[7364.66s -> 7366.83s]  There's a place where I couldn't cut before.
[7366.83s -> 7368.83s]  I gotta go back to the main room because I gotta see
[7368.83s -> 7370.83s]  if that guy's okay.
[7370.83s -> 7374.42s]  So we gotta go...
[7374.42s -> 7377.92s]  straight right, left.
[7377.92s -> 7386.94s]  Fuck! I screwed it up!
[7386.94s -> 7389.25s]  I need to heal.
[7389.25s -> 7391.25s]  Do I care about the knife?
[7391.25s -> 7397.78s]  Give me the knife. Where'd the knife go?
[7397.78s -> 7399.78s]  Why's the knife gone?
[7399.78s -> 7402.66s]  The knife just disappeared. Why?
[7402.66s -> 7413.28s]  Okay, leave.
[7413.28s -> 7416.35s]  I'm just gonna... No more killing people.
[7416.35s -> 7424.42s]  Just gotta go. All the way down.
[7424.42s -> 7430.11s]  Straight.
[7430.11s -> 7432.11s]  Ha! Ha! Ha!
[7432.11s -> 7439.92s]  It's okay. Shit!
[7439.92s -> 7443.17s]  This is blocked!
[7443.17s -> 7445.17s]  Oh, god damn it. Okay, I don't have the fuse.
[7445.17s -> 7447.17s]  Oh, I gotta go back through the press
[7447.17s -> 7449.17s]  room? Back up the stairs?
[7449.17s -> 7458.32s]  Can I... Hold on.
[7458.32s -> 7460.32s]  Uh... I haven't gone through there
[7460.32s -> 7466.21s]  yet. I don't want any
[7466.21s -> 7469.22s]  swords! Just... Fine, I'll take it.
[7469.22s -> 7481.18s]  Okay, this way.
[7481.18s -> 7491.02s]  And then I can bang a left...
[7491.02s -> 7502.48s]  No, back up the... I'll turn the light back
[7502.48s -> 7512.98s]  on. Why did I turn it off?
[7512.98s -> 7514.98s]  Change door. Oh, ooh! Okay.
[7514.98s -> 7526.74s]  Okay, out here.
[7526.74s -> 7533.82s]  Take a left.
[7533.82s -> 7537.34s]  I was supposed to take a left.
[7537.34s -> 7539.34s]  It doesn't matter. I can go in either one of these doors.
[7539.34s -> 7548.42s]  Change door.
[7548.42s -> 7550.42s]  No, the chained one is on the other side
[7550.42s -> 7552.42s]  of this door. Oh,
[7552.42s -> 7554.42s]  Jeremy.
[7554.42s -> 7556.42s]  Sometimes I wish
[7556.42s -> 7558.42s]  that you didn't have an eighth grade
[7558.42s -> 7560.42s]  fucking brain.
[7560.42s -> 7581.58s]  No, get him off! Okay.
[7581.58s -> 7584.21s]  So that takes us to take a right
[7584.21s -> 7600.85s]  and then cut the door down.
[7600.85s -> 7602.85s]  This is the east office. Let's take a look around.
[7602.85s -> 7608.29s]  Let's explore.
[7608.29s -> 7614.82s]  What the fuck is that noise?
[7614.82s -> 7618.14s]  Flash grenade.
[7618.14s -> 7620.14s]  Equip on the inventory screen to use guaranteed to daze
[7620.14s -> 7624.05s]  and stun enemies within its effective radius.
[7624.05s -> 7626.05s]  Can be used to counter attack when you
[7626.05s -> 7628.05s]  are caught by an enemy. It's great.
[7628.05s -> 7630.05s]  Left bumper and then right trigger is
[7630.05s -> 7634.91s]  throw it. WINDOW!
[7634.91s -> 7646.35s]  Alright, we're good.
[7646.35s -> 7650.32s]  And herb. I got room for it.
[7650.32s -> 7652.32s]  What else is in here? Let's take a quick look.
[7652.32s -> 7655.90s]  Got a boarded window now.
[7655.90s -> 7657.90s]  If you can't get through it, watch out for the glass.
[7657.90s -> 7659.90s]  There's probably, what's over here?
[7659.90s -> 7662.34s]  More gunpowder.
[7662.34s -> 7676.22s]  Can't take it.
[7676.22s -> 7699.44s]  Electrical part.
[7699.44s -> 7702.77s]  Mushroom. There's so many important items in here
[7702.77s -> 7705.90s]  that I can't take.
[7705.90s -> 7707.90s]  High grade gunpowder. Shit!
[7707.90s -> 7716.67s]  I have to come back here and just pick
[7716.67s -> 7718.67s]  everything up. All these are incredibly
[7718.67s -> 7727.76s]  important items. I need the fuse
[7727.76s -> 7729.76s]  to open the door to unlock here.
[7729.76s -> 7731.76s]  So what am I gonna replace or get rid of?
[7731.76s -> 7733.76s]  I love this game.
[7733.76s -> 7735.94s]  Alright. I'm fine.
[7735.94s -> 7737.94s]  I can't combine this.
[7737.94s -> 7740.56s]  I can't, I just have to throw the flashbang
[7740.56s -> 7742.93s]  at somebody. Consume the herb?
[7742.93s -> 7747.79s]  I know I gotta take the fuse, but
[7747.79s -> 7749.79s]  what am I gonna replace the fuse with? Just like fucking
[7749.79s -> 7751.79s]  put the herb up my nose?
[7751.79s -> 7756.40s]  I could throw the flashbang, but that's
[7756.40s -> 7762.16s]  not worth it.
[7762.16s -> 7764.16s]  Or I could go to storage. Where's the storage box here?
[7764.16s -> 7766.16s]  Watchman's room?
[7766.16s -> 7768.16s]  Yeah, just hold on. Hold tight, everybody.
[7768.16s -> 7772.90s]  Cause then I can,
[7772.90s -> 7774.90s]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7774.90s -> 7780.85s]  I think so. Yeah?
[7780.85s -> 7788.59s]  Is there a storage box in here?
[7788.59s -> 7791.09s]  No? Yeah? No.
[7791.09s -> 7806.37s]  Okay, I'll take these.
[7806.37s -> 7809.31s]  Hold on.
[7809.31s -> 7812.13s]  Where's that storage box?
[7812.13s -> 7816.98s]  Yeah?
[7816.98s -> 7818.98s]  Press room? Bathroom?
[7818.98s -> 7827.36s]  I know there's one on the floor, isn't there?
[7827.36s -> 7833.70s]  Where's that storage box?
[7833.70s -> 7835.70s]  No, it's not in here.
[7835.70s -> 7837.70s]  Is it in here? Yeah?
[7837.70s -> 7843.33s]  Is it not marked?
[7843.33s -> 7845.33s]  Oh, I don't think, are all of them marked?
[7845.33s -> 7848.02s]  Oh, fuck it isn't. No, yeah, you're right.
[7848.02s -> 7850.02s]  There's one here.
[7850.02s -> 7852.02s]  That's what I'm thinking of. We're not there.
[7852.02s -> 7860.98s]  I could try to go back upstairs.
[7860.98s -> 7865.33s]  Or I'm just gonna, you know what?
[7865.33s -> 7869.04s]  Fuck it.
[7869.04s -> 7871.04s]  Oh, this is a lot. This is a lot I have to think about.
[7871.04s -> 7873.04s]  Because I need to, I have to just eat the herb.
[7873.04s -> 7876.05s]  Look, I've been doing, I've been playing so well.
[7876.05s -> 7878.05s]  The game has given me enough healing to heal.
[7878.05s -> 7880.05s]  And I'm just like throwing it right back in their face.
[7880.05s -> 7882.05s]  With such lines as, I don't need this shit.
[7882.05s -> 7884.05s]  And it's clear that I've already eaten.
[7884.05s -> 7886.05s]  So I'm not hungry.
[7886.05s -> 7888.05s]  Let's go.
[7888.05s -> 7890.74s]  I don't care. Let's go.
[7890.74s -> 7928.82s]  Don't eat it.
[7928.82s -> 7944.67s]  Just get hit one less time.
[7944.67s -> 7946.67s]  Don't you guys understand?
[7946.67s -> 7949.62s]  Just don't get hit one extra time.
[7949.62s -> 7951.62s]  And that doesn't matter.
[7951.62s -> 7954.24s]  Alright, where are you at? How are you doing?
[7954.24s -> 7958.91s]  I can hear him. He's a zombie now, isn't he?
[7958.91s -> 7965.57s]  Is somebody in here?
[7965.57s -> 7970.37s]  No, still alive. Alright, okay.
[7970.37s -> 7976.51s]  Alright, that's fine.
[7976.51s -> 7978.94s]  Storage box.
[7978.94s -> 7984.58s]  Streamer wets himself on stream.
[7984.58s -> 7986.58s]  Oh, you would know if that were the case.
[7986.58s -> 7988.58s]  Alright, I'm gonna store the ruby.
[7988.58s -> 7990.58s]  Bring the key card.
[7990.58s -> 7993.65s]  Store the...
[7993.65s -> 7995.65s]  Look at all these things I have in here.
[7995.65s -> 8000.64s]  I could just use the gunpowder or...
[8000.64s -> 8004.10s]  I could store the flash grenade.
[8004.10s -> 8012.22s]  Let me go get...
[8012.22s -> 8014.22s]  I just burp so fucking loud.
[8014.22s -> 8016.22s]  That's why I don't do face cam.
[8016.22s -> 8018.22s]  That's why I don't have mic ever.
[8018.22s -> 8022.38s]  Alright.
[8022.38s -> 8024.38s]  I want another water.
[8024.38s -> 8244.93s]  I'll be right back.
[8244.93s -> 8247.81s]  It's so dark in here.
[8247.81s -> 8251.65s]  I don't like how dark it is in here.
[8251.65s -> 8253.65s]  Can I turn the lights back on?
[8253.65s -> 8261.38s]  What's going on?
[8261.38s -> 8263.81s]  All the hearts?
[8263.81s -> 8268.61s]  Why is everybody doing hearts?
[8268.61s -> 8274.82s]  Is there any particular reason?
[8274.82s -> 8278.46s]  Show my pants.
[8278.46s -> 8281.28s]  What's wrong with my pants?
[8281.28s -> 8283.28s]  They're just regular pants.
[8283.28s -> 8287.50s]  Because you peed yourself and we feel bad.
[8287.50s -> 8292.75s]  Alright, I don't need this.
[8292.75s -> 8295.95s]  I wanna get the shotgun.
[8295.95s -> 8297.95s]  But then I'm gonna have a permanent shotgun.
[8297.95s -> 8299.95s]  What am I supposed to do?
[8299.95s -> 8304.69s]  I have to think about this stuff because then
[8304.69s -> 8306.69s]  what am I supposed to do?
[8306.69s -> 8308.69s]  Shotgun is gonna go here.
[8308.69s -> 8312.85s]  Shotgun bullets.
[8312.85s -> 8320.21s]  When do I get the inventory upgraded?
[8320.21s -> 8324.82s]  Alright, this is a very...
[8324.82s -> 8326.99s]  I like this a lot.
[8326.99s -> 8330.00s]  So we got press room.
[8330.00s -> 8332.56s]  Bathroom.
[8332.56s -> 8334.56s]  Where are the wire cutters?
[8334.56s -> 8337.25s]  Locked door.
[8337.25s -> 8339.25s]  Chained door. So I can go back here.
[8339.25s -> 8343.84s]  Let me see the...
[8343.84s -> 8347.30s]  Let me see the other floors.
[8347.30s -> 8349.30s]  Okay, so I got one more chained door
[8349.30s -> 8351.30s]  to cut.
[8351.30s -> 8353.60s]  And then that will be done.
[8353.60s -> 8355.60s]  So let me go open this chained door.
[8355.60s -> 8358.10s]  Well, Herbert
[8358.10s -> 8360.10s]  gives five community subs. Thanks a lot, Herbert.
[8360.10s -> 8363.36s]  Thank you, all of you.
[8363.36s -> 8368.54s]  You guys are fucking incredible. Thank you.
[8368.54s -> 8370.54s]  You guys are fucking unbelievable to me.
[8370.54s -> 8373.10s]  Thank you so much.
[8373.10s -> 8379.38s]  Chained door.
[8379.38s -> 8383.79s]  Because then I can get rid of that.
[8383.79s -> 8385.79s]  Let me go get rid of the pliers.
[8385.79s -> 8387.79s]  Because I'm not gonna need them more after this.
[8387.79s -> 8390.16s]  Let me set a waypoint right here.
[8390.16s -> 8392.16s]  So straight through the reception, bang a right.
[8392.16s -> 8394.16s]  Straight through the reception,
[8394.16s -> 8396.16s]  straight through the door, bang a right.
[8396.16s -> 8400.64s]  Operations room, chained door.
[8400.64s -> 8408.62s]  Okay, straight through.
[8408.62s -> 8410.80s]  Then that brings us to here.
[8410.80s -> 8412.80s]  Let me go straight all the way down to the right.
[8412.80s -> 8414.80s]  Do I have any boards? I don't have any boards.
[8414.80s -> 8416.80s]  Operations room, straight all the way down.
[8416.80s -> 8426.59s]  The windows are now open.
[8426.59s -> 8428.59s]  Now I understand why I should have boarded those windows.
[8428.59s -> 8434.14s]  Damn it!
[8434.14s -> 8436.32s]  Spin? Do I spin?
[8436.32s -> 8448.14s]  Okay.
[8448.14s -> 8451.73s]  This is why there's so many of them.
[8451.73s -> 8455.82s]  There's like 300
[8455.82s -> 8457.82s]  enemies against me right now.
[8457.82s -> 8459.82s]  Chained, this will be it. I'm gonna use it.
[8459.82s -> 8465.97s]  That's the last door that's locked up.
[8465.97s -> 8467.97s]  Yup, okay. Goodbye.
[8467.97s -> 8469.97s]  Thank you. It was very nice of you to be here
[8469.97s -> 8471.97s]  and give me the check box, but now you're gone.
[8471.97s -> 8473.97s]  What's in here?
[8473.97s -> 8477.23s]  Electr- jag- electronic
[8477.23s -> 8484.78s]  gadget. I said I was gonna
[8484.78s -> 8486.78s]  get a water and I just got another cup of coffee.
[8486.78s -> 8490.69s]  I think he might be deranged.
[8490.69s -> 8492.69s]  Alright, uh, a medium-sized
[8492.69s -> 8494.69s]  electronic gadget. Let's examine it.
[8494.69s -> 8500.32s]  Some sort of electronic gadget.
[8500.32s -> 8506.91s]  Uh, needs
[8506.91s -> 8509.34s]  a battery. A detonator for
[8509.34s -> 8511.34s]  C4 explosive. It's missing a battery.
[8511.34s -> 8516.32s]  Okay, so I'm gonna store
[8516.32s -> 8518.32s]  this until I find a battery for it.
[8518.32s -> 8523.81s]  Lobster room.
[8523.81s -> 8528.10s]  How am I doing on health? Fine.
[8528.10s -> 8531.49s]  I'm fine.
[8531.49s -> 8553.68s]  Fuck is that?
[8553.68s -> 8556.69s]  What was that? Oh, I unlocked it?
[8556.69s -> 8562.58s]  There's a flashbang in there.
[8562.58s -> 8564.58s]  Okay, locker terminal.
[8564.58s -> 8566.94s]  I got the electronic gadget.
[8566.94s -> 8573.52s]  It's a flash grenade.
[8573.52s -> 8575.52s]  All headshots. I'm
[8575.52s -> 8577.52s]  sorry, but when I went downstairs
[8577.52s -> 8579.52s]  to get some water and a coffee,
[8579.52s -> 8581.89s]  I was immediately backseated.
[8581.89s -> 8583.89s]  Like, it was- Atalix was waiting
[8583.89s -> 8585.89s]  at the bottom of the stairs for me. He was sitting there
[8585.89s -> 8587.89s]  going like this way. He knew I was gonna take a break.
[8587.89s -> 8589.89s]  And when I opened up the door and looked over, he said
[8589.89s -> 8591.89s]  it's bad if you just shoot
[8591.89s -> 8593.89s]  heads. He said, shoot up the limbs and stuff.
[8593.89s -> 8595.89s]  It'll help you. And I'm like, oh,
[8595.89s -> 8597.89s]  okay. How long have you been standing there for?
[8597.89s -> 8599.89s]  He's like, the whole time. I've just been watching on my phone
[8599.89s -> 8601.89s]  waiting for you to come down. I'm like,
[8601.89s -> 8604.38s]  alright, thanks, man.
[8604.38s -> 8608.93s]  Alright, we got the records room here. Let's go in.
[8608.93s -> 8625.10s]  I don't have that key.
[8625.10s -> 8627.10s]  Damn it, I fucking missed him.
[8627.10s -> 8635.02s]  Heart door.
[8635.02s -> 8637.33s]  Sync. Locker terminal.
[8637.33s -> 8639.33s]  Weapons locker. Ah, the weapons locker. But
[8639.33s -> 8641.33s]  I don't have enough room for that.
[8641.33s -> 8648.50s]  What's on the table? Nothing else in here
[8648.50s -> 8650.50s]  that I need. I got the electronic equipment.
[8650.50s -> 8653.31s]  I have just screwed myself
[8653.31s -> 8660.48s]  so much.
[8660.48s -> 8662.48s]  Why did you-
[8662.48s -> 8669.97s]  Ah, okay.
[8669.97s -> 8672.27s]  Weapons locker. We're gonna jump through here.
[8672.27s -> 8677.71s]  And I know I'm
[8677.71s -> 8679.71s]  a compulsive
[8679.71s -> 8681.71s]  map viewer. I know I am. But I have
[8681.71s -> 8684.02s]  to. Straight left left.
[8684.02s -> 8696.61s]  What?
[8700.00s -> 8710.93s]  Was it a dud?
[8710.93s -> 8714.64s]  Alright, I got the key card. I can finally get
[8714.64s -> 8721.74s]  rid of this now. I'll put it
[8721.74s -> 8723.74s]  in the locker. Give me the shotgun. Give me the shotgun
[8723.74s -> 8727.14s]  shells. Nice.
[8727.14s -> 8729.14s]  W870.
[8729.14s -> 8732.27s]  Let's go ahead and load it. Change weapons.
[8732.27s -> 8734.27s]  So it's down. Let's go ahead and load it.
[8737.22s -> 8739.52s]  Fucking asshole. What are you doing in here?
[8739.52s -> 8746.69s]  What is going on?
[8748.69s -> 8770.94s]  I got the shotgun. I'm fucking
[8770.94s -> 8772.94s]  like itchy and stuff. That's how you know
[8772.94s -> 8774.94s]  shit's getting all actually wild.
[8774.94s -> 8777.82s]  Okay. I need
[8777.82s -> 8780.06s]  to go
[8780.06s -> 8782.43s]  back here
[8782.43s -> 8784.43s]  to the east office to get myself
[8784.43s -> 8786.86s]  the handle and
[8786.86s -> 8788.86s]  some gunpowder. And then the valve
[8788.86s -> 8790.86s]  goes into the valve unit which was over- okay
[8790.86s -> 8792.86s]  so we gotta turn around
[8792.86s -> 8794.86s]  through west office. So through the door
[8794.86s -> 8796.86s]  turn around through door
[8796.86s -> 8798.86s]  out the other door into the main hall.
[8798.86s -> 8800.86s]  Save game.
[8800.86s -> 8811.28s]  You're not gonna get up, are you?
[8811.28s -> 8822.48s]  How you doing? You good?
[8822.48s -> 8824.78s]  Hey dude, I found a shotgun.
[8824.78s -> 8832.19s]  We're gonna be just fine. Okay.
[8832.19s -> 8834.19s]  So there- I got shotgun shells
[8834.19s -> 8836.19s]  in here. Get them out.
[8836.19s -> 8840.29s]  Wooden board. Electronic device
[8840.29s -> 8842.29s]  store it. Wooden board store it.
[8842.29s -> 8844.53s]  Gunpowder. Um,
[8844.53s -> 8846.53s]  first aid spray maybe. No. Red herb
[8846.53s -> 8850.18s]  no. Red jewel
[8850.18s -> 8852.18s]  maybe is what I'll need in here soon. I don't know.
[8852.18s -> 8855.70s]  Yo, shave tonight.
[8855.70s -> 8862.03s]  I'm not shaving ever again.
[8862.03s -> 8865.23s]  Save it. This will take us out there.
[8865.23s -> 8867.23s]  I got- I can get the valve now
[8867.23s -> 8869.23s]  which is just straight through. Go in, grab valve.
[8869.23s -> 8876.72s]  Is there a minute- enemy in
[8876.72s -> 8881.07s]  here? No. You can only hold
[8881.07s -> 8883.07s]  six bullets in a shotgun. That's fine.
[8883.07s -> 8886.08s]  This thing is broken.
[8886.08s -> 8896.69s]  No, nevermind. Let's bring this in
[8896.69s -> 8898.69s]  here. Give me the valve
[8898.69s -> 8901.44s]  which is in this office. Is somebody in the office?
[8901.44s -> 8903.44s]  I think there might be somebody lying on the ground.
[8903.44s -> 8906.96s]  No. Okay. Round
[8906.96s -> 8910.29s]  handle. Take it.
[8910.29s -> 8912.29s]  Super gunpowder. Take it.
[8912.29s -> 8917.73s]  Now, where
[8917.73s -> 8923.10s]  was that valve?
[8923.10s -> 8925.10s]  Valve was
[8925.10s -> 8931.38s]  Jack valve.
[8931.38s -> 8934.51s]  Second floor. So we gotta go
[8934.51s -> 8937.26s]  main hall. Is there a way
[8937.26s -> 8939.26s]  I can get up from here? A fire escape maybe?
[8939.26s -> 8942.02s]  No, that's too far away. We gotta go
[8942.02s -> 8944.64s]  main hall. So just go back to where I
[8944.64s -> 8946.94s]  was. Save game.
[8946.94s -> 8950.85s]  Am I doing a joke or am I just acting
[8950.85s -> 8953.41s]  weird? What do you mean?
[8953.41s -> 8959.04s]  The way he's narrating everything is
[8959.04s -> 8965.44s]  very YouTube streamer.
[8965.44s -> 8967.94s]  Am I acting weird?
[8967.94s -> 8974.96s]  Am I?
[8974.96s -> 8976.96s]  I can't even
[8976.96s -> 8978.96s]  tell.
[8978.96s -> 8986.77s]  Let's go back to the main hall. It's because I'm saying
[8986.77s -> 8992.98s]  everything I'm doing?
[8992.98s -> 9000.02s]  Is that the issue?
[9000.02s -> 9002.02s]  It's very tuber-like what you're doing.
[9002.02s -> 9004.45s]  Okay, so we get to main hall and then
[9004.45s -> 9006.45s]  I'm gonna activate this device. That's the
[9006.45s -> 9010.35s]  problem. I guess.
[9010.35s -> 9014.88s]  Okay. I need to use all this
[9014.88s -> 9016.88s]  but I'm gonna store the gunpowder. I have a lot of
[9016.88s -> 9019.31s]  gunpowder. I'm doing it again.
[9019.31s -> 9057.57s]  But I would be... How do I get over
[9057.57s -> 9062.69s]  there? Hey, you're doing great. Hey, thanks.
[9062.69s -> 9068.38s]  Is there a way I gotta go up?
[9068.38s -> 9070.62s]  Can I climb up?
[9070.62s -> 9074.26s]  I don't know. Who has any
[9074.26s -> 9076.26s]  damn idea?
[9076.26s -> 9098.40s]  I'm on the third floor now. Wrong floor.
[9098.40s -> 9107.42s]  I'm gonna go up and around here and then
[9107.42s -> 9109.42s]  down, which will take me. Okay, so I gotta go around
[9109.42s -> 9112.43s]  through the...
[9112.43s -> 9117.42s]  Yeah.
[9117.42s -> 9125.49s]  Bullets. I didn't miss anything though.
[9125.49s -> 9127.49s]  Like that. Some guys
[9127.49s -> 9129.49s]  scribblings.
[9129.49s -> 9133.20s]  Damn, those corporate assholes. They cut me off.
[9133.20s -> 9135.20s]  After all I've done for them but that's...
[9135.20s -> 9137.20s]  If that's how it's gonna be, so be it.
[9137.20s -> 9139.20s]  I'm gonna have a little fun of my own as the world
[9139.20s -> 9141.20s]  goes to shit. I boarded all those
[9141.20s -> 9143.20s]  filthy pigs up in a steel pen
[9143.20s -> 9146.59s]  and set some C4.
[9146.59s -> 9148.59s]  All I gotta do is detonate it.
[9148.59s -> 9150.83s]  Okay. It's no fun
[9150.83s -> 9152.83s]  if it's over too soon so maybe I'll give that
[9152.83s -> 9154.83s]  one raving loon something to really
[9154.83s -> 9157.07s]  squeal about. Yeah, maybe I'll
[9157.07s -> 9159.07s]  give him a little toy and tell him kill the guy
[9159.07s -> 9161.07s]  next to you and I'll spare the others.
[9161.07s -> 9163.57s]  I wonder what he'll do.
[9163.57s -> 9165.57s]  You yell about justice and pride but how
[9165.57s -> 9167.57s]  many times did you go against me, your own
[9167.57s -> 9169.81s]  superior? Okay, you're such a
[9169.81s -> 9172.37s]  good cop so good you had to die.
[9172.37s -> 9174.37s]  This is fun. I need some music
[9174.37s -> 9178.14s]  for this. Okay. So
[9178.14s -> 9180.14s]  there's people locked up somewhere?
[9180.14s -> 9183.54s]  What the hell is this? Hip
[9183.54s -> 9190.62s]  pouch. Oh.
[9190.62s -> 9192.62s]  That's exactly what I wanted. Thank god.
[9192.62s -> 9196.40s]  So that's how you increase
[9196.40s -> 9198.77s]  your size. Got it.
[9198.77s -> 9205.94s]  Grandfather clock.
[9205.94s -> 9217.31s]  Nothing else over here.
[9217.31s -> 9221.52s]  I don't want to miss anything.
[9221.52s -> 9223.52s]  So what is this going to lead to? This will lead
[9223.52s -> 9225.52s]  out to where I want to go.
[9225.52s -> 9238.24s]  Do I have any boards? No.
[9238.24s -> 9241.06s]  Unnecessary though.
[9241.06s -> 9246.24s]  Then I could be able to take
[9246.24s -> 9248.24s]  the stairs down and
[9248.24s -> 9250.24s]  there's the valve.
[9250.24s -> 9254.77s]  Interesting. I still
[9254.77s -> 9267.38s]  don't know the combination of this shit.
[9267.38s -> 9271.73s]  Dick. I have to shoot this
[9271.73s -> 9273.73s]  guy because there's nowhere for me to get out of here.
[9273.73s -> 9281.84s]  What the? I'm stooping into the
[9281.84s -> 9283.84s]  heads. I'm only shooting in heads.
[9283.84s -> 9296.83s]  Okay.
[9296.83s -> 9298.83s]  So I could heal full.
[9298.83s -> 9300.83s]  I'm not supposed
[9300.83s -> 9302.83s]  to have these. I'm not supposed to take this right now.
[9302.83s -> 9310.83s]  Metallix, I shot him in the
[9310.83s -> 9312.83s]  leg and the stomach and the groin
[9312.83s -> 9314.83s]  and I went against my own rule of headshots
[9314.83s -> 9317.84s]  only and I got bit. This is
[9317.84s -> 9319.84s]  your fault. You told me to
[9319.84s -> 9326.88s]  do this. Shoot him in the leg more
[9326.88s -> 9328.88s]  than one time. That's not what you said. You said
[9328.88s -> 9330.88s]  shoot him in the leg. And I said, okay.
[9330.88s -> 9335.74s]  Alright. Valve is back here.
[9335.74s -> 9343.42s]  Alright. There's bullets over here though.
[9343.42s -> 9345.42s]  Only a Sith. Only a Sith is
[9345.42s -> 9347.42s]  an absolute, right? That's what you would say in that accent.
[9347.42s -> 9361.81s]  Let's turn it off.
[9361.81s -> 9365.14s]  I feel like I'm missing
[9365.14s -> 9367.14s]  some things with the locker combinations.
[9367.14s -> 9369.14s]  But it's all good. Alright.
[9369.14s -> 9373.55s]  Anything I can do in here.
[9373.55s -> 9380.91s]  Hot water tank. Cool.
[9380.91s -> 9385.78s]  Dead or alive?
[9385.78s -> 9402.91s]  Yeah. Dead.
[9402.91s -> 9407.18s]  That's fine.
[9407.18s -> 9409.68s]  What is this? Gunpowder.
[9409.68s -> 9411.68s]  I'm gonna, just, I'm gonna combine it.
[9411.68s -> 9416.10s]  I have so much handgun bullets.
[9416.10s -> 9419.30s]  Might as well do it. Just on one of them, right?
[9419.30s -> 9432.85s]  Giving me
[9432.85s -> 9441.49s]  a lot of ammunition here.
[9441.49s -> 9443.49s]  So this is bringing me back here. There's a
[9443.49s -> 9449.38s]  door here and a door there.
[9449.38s -> 9452.13s]  It's one of those, shh, don't
[9452.13s -> 9454.43s]  walk silently.
[9454.43s -> 9456.98s]  Ah! What?
[9456.98s -> 9458.98s]  He just did like a street fighter move to me.
[9458.98s -> 9477.92s]  Oh my god.
[9477.92s -> 9480.53s]  I have no health now. Oh
[9480.53s -> 9484.82s]  shit. Whatever. I don't think there's anybody in here.
[9484.82s -> 9489.04s]  Keeping the shotgun out though.
[9489.04s -> 9491.60s]  I'm not gonna let that happen again.
[9491.60s -> 9494.61s]  Flashbang.
[9494.61s -> 9511.23s]  Dart. Throwing dart.
[9511.23s -> 9517.44s]  First aid spray. Alright. There's an office
[9517.44s -> 9519.44s]  in here. I'm not gonna activate that computer just yet.
[9519.44s -> 9523.15s]  What's in the office?
[9523.15s -> 9527.87s]  Internal memo.
[9527.87s -> 9529.87s]  Oh, office supply, internal relocation
[9529.87s -> 9531.87s]  notice. Heat resistant
[9531.87s -> 9533.87s]  three number combination safe.
[9533.87s -> 9536.18s]  Moved from Star's office
[9536.18s -> 9538.18s]  to West office first floor.
[9538.18s -> 9541.12s]  Right? So West office.
[9541.12s -> 9543.12s]  The combo is left
[9543.12s -> 9545.12s]  nine, right fifteen, left seven.
[9545.12s -> 9547.42s]  Nine, fifteen, seven.
[9547.42s -> 9550.11s]  Nine, fifteen, okay.
[9550.11s -> 9552.11s]  Please change the combo as soon as possible.
[9552.11s -> 9554.11s]  There's a combination of the safe downstairs.
[9554.11s -> 9560.88s]  Very cool. You guys need to
[9560.88s -> 9564.34s]  and there's the battery. That goes into
[9564.34s -> 9568.18s]  that unit. Alright, nice.
[9568.18s -> 9571.70s]  I'm making progress here.
[9571.70s -> 9574.13s]  Plenty of bullets. Some red
[9574.13s -> 9578.35s]  herb. Out of space.
[9578.35s -> 9591.14s]  No I'm not. I have so many
[9591.14s -> 9593.14s]  of those. It's worth doing at least once maybe.
[9593.14s -> 9596.38s]  Throw away
[9596.38s -> 9598.38s]  the gunpowder.
[9598.38s -> 9602.54s]  Now that's not correct.
[9602.54s -> 9605.04s]  Matilda. Wait, wait.
[9605.04s -> 9607.34s]  Do I have a CD or a thumb drive or something I need?
[9607.34s -> 9611.38s]  What about the battery?
[9611.38s -> 9618.85s]  Failed to authenticate account.
[9618.85s -> 9620.85s]  I need a USB dongle
[9620.85s -> 9623.73s]  to unlock this door.
[9623.73s -> 9632.99s]  Looks like a different gun.
[9632.99s -> 9634.99s]  Back out to where the liquor is.
[9634.99s -> 9637.36s]  Lightning Hawk times three.
[9637.36s -> 9641.46s]  So, I got a battery
[9641.46s -> 9643.46s]  and I got the safe combination to the door
[9643.46s -> 9645.46s]  to the safe down here. So, we need to go
[9645.46s -> 9647.76s]  down, which is
[9647.76s -> 9649.76s]  West Office. Safe is back
[9649.76s -> 9654.18s]  here. It's for that. So, I'm gonna get out
[9654.18s -> 9656.54s]  here and back downstairs.
[9656.54s -> 9661.28s]  Make our way to the West Office.
[9661.28s -> 9663.28s]  Let me just keep going. No, I need to get
[9663.28s -> 9668.08s]  to the save point.
[9668.08s -> 9672.24s]  Behind you. Stop doing
[9672.24s -> 9675.31s]  that. You know how fucking neurotic
[9675.31s -> 9677.94s]  I am? Don't do that. Don't
[9677.94s -> 9746.29s]  do that to me. I'll come back here after
[9746.29s -> 9748.29s]  I go back.
[9748.29s -> 9761.07s]  Right in the fucking brain!
[9761.07s -> 9768.11s]  What the fuck? He's still alive?
[9768.11s -> 9771.38s]  No!
[9771.38s -> 9775.98s]  Die, die, die, die, die, die!
[9775.98s -> 9781.87s]  What the fuck?
[9781.87s -> 9795.12s]  What was that?
[9795.12s -> 9797.36s]  What was that clown
[9797.36s -> 9813.74s]  move? He just
[9813.74s -> 9815.74s]  fucking threw himself into the corner.
[9815.74s -> 9825.02s]  Does he come through the door?
[9825.02s -> 9832.38s]  Okay, wait, wait, I'll...
[9832.38s -> 9836.22s]  He can't go through there, right?
[9836.22s -> 9840.26s]  Does the door eventually explode?
[9840.26s -> 9848.45s]  So, this is... I need the horse.
[9848.45s -> 9857.34s]  It's this right here, right here. No.
[9857.34s -> 9859.34s]  Where is it? This one.
[9859.34s -> 9861.78s]  So, it's Pisces,
[9861.78s -> 9865.04s]  fish, crab,
[9865.04s -> 9867.86s]  vase, I guess.
[9867.86s -> 9885.70s]  Give me the disc. It fits.
[9885.70s -> 9888.32s]  I really thought three
[9888.32s -> 9890.32s]  shotgun blasts point blank would do it.
[9890.32s -> 9892.32s]  Apparently not, and there's a police station
[9892.32s -> 9895.07s]  up the floor map. Nice.
[9895.07s -> 9900.30s]  I can't go in the linen room.
[9900.30s -> 9902.30s]  This is going to take me back to the library and then back down to the
[9902.30s -> 9906.14s]  main hall. Okay,
[9906.14s -> 9910.69s]  so I did everything I could do there.
[9910.69s -> 9912.69s]  Fish, crab? No, fish, then crab,
[9912.69s -> 9914.69s]  then vase.
[9914.69s -> 9917.63s]  I'm going to put this back in there and then
[9917.63s -> 9924.54s]  we'll go from there. He's not going to be
[9924.54s -> 9927.81s]  behind this door, right?
[9927.81s -> 9930.56s]  They are, though. Take a right.
[9930.56s -> 9939.12s]  Here we are. Beautiful.
[9939.12s -> 9951.65s]  Safe point. Stick it
[9951.65s -> 9959.78s]  in there. You're in Castle
[9959.78s -> 9961.78s]  Cainhurst. That's a pretty great reference,
[9961.78s -> 9967.41s]  actually. So,
[9967.41s -> 9970.29s]  gunpowder, gunpowder,
[9970.29s -> 9972.46s]  the jewels. Let me
[9972.46s -> 9974.46s]  put the battery in the detonator.
[9974.46s -> 9987.55s]  Detonator.
[9987.55s -> 9989.55s]  It looks like it's just
[9989.55s -> 9993.65s]  for C4.
[9993.65s -> 9997.81s]  Red herb. No blue
[9997.81s -> 10000.69s]  herbs. Alright, so I got
[10000.69s -> 10002.69s]  gunpowder and then I got high grade gunpowder.
[10002.69s -> 10004.69s]  Should I do one
[10004.69s -> 10009.81s]  and two? What was it? What are you doing?
[10009.81s -> 10016.32s]  What are you guys doing?
[10016.32s -> 10018.32s]  I have to increase the visibility in my room. Hold on.
[10018.32s -> 10025.17s]  Okay, that's better.
[10025.17s -> 10028.24s]  Every hour I have to increase the visibility because the sun's
[10028.24s -> 10032.27s]  going down.
[10032.27s -> 10034.27s]  BB pistol, BY
[10034.27s -> 10037.66s]  shotgun. Let's do
[10037.66s -> 10039.66s]  a BY.
[10039.66s -> 10042.67s]  Let's make some shotgun shells. Why not?
[10042.67s -> 10051.50s]  Might as well use them.
[10051.50s -> 10056.43s]  I could do it again. I'm going to do it again.
[10056.43s -> 10062.00s]  I'm one of those people that will never use
[10062.00s -> 10065.71s]  these. I just won't.
[10065.71s -> 10068.78s]  I'm so obsessed
[10068.78s -> 10072.94s]  with them. No, don't use them.
[10072.94s -> 10074.94s]  You're going to need them later. Alright.
[10074.94s -> 10079.36s]  That's a hundred dollars
[10079.36s -> 10081.36s]  from La Cranda.
[10081.36s -> 10084.93s]  Hundred bucks.
[10084.93s -> 10087.49s]  Thank you, La Cranda.
[10087.49s -> 10089.49s]  What's going on, Jerma? I hope to see you playing Fortnite
[10089.49s -> 10091.49s]  tonight with Thanos. I know I'd want
[10091.49s -> 10093.49s]  to be there. Much love.
[10093.49s -> 10095.92s]  That's not going to happen.
[10095.92s -> 10097.92s]  I'm not going to play Fortnite ever.
[10097.92s -> 10100.67s]  For any reason.
[10100.67s -> 10102.67s]  Thanos is in
[10102.67s -> 10104.67s]  Fortnite. Sometimes I forget about that.
[10104.67s -> 10111.63s]  Why?
[10111.63s -> 10113.87s]  Thank you so much
[10113.87s -> 10115.87s]  for your hundred fucking dollars. I really appreciate
[10115.87s -> 10117.87s]  it. But unfortunately
[10117.87s -> 10119.87s]  you're not ever going to see me play Fortnite.
[10119.87s -> 10124.34s]  Sorry to say.
[10124.34s -> 10126.34s]  Why is he in Fortnite?
[10126.34s -> 10129.28s]  Why is John Wick
[10129.28s -> 10132.22s]  in Fortnite? Just wait.
[10132.22s -> 10134.22s]  Mickey Mouse will be in Fortnite
[10134.22s -> 10138.06s]  in six months.
[10138.06s -> 10140.06s]  I'm going to hold on to these because
[10140.06s -> 10142.30s]  at least, yeah, because I want to save for the
[10142.30s -> 10145.63s]  machine gun. But
[10145.63s -> 10148.00s]  should I carry the detonator around
[10148.00s -> 10150.00s]  with me? That's something I don't think I want to
[10150.00s -> 10152.94s]  do. Take the first aid spray.
[10152.94s -> 10154.94s]  The jewel, maybe?
[10154.94s -> 10156.94s]  I don't know. Maybe I'll need it eventually here.
[10156.94s -> 10162.58s]  Nah, it'll be in Fortnite. Or
[10162.58s -> 10164.58s]  like Donald Duck or somebody
[10164.58s -> 10168.29s]  will be in Fortnite.
[10168.29s -> 10173.98s]  Default skin.
[10173.98s -> 10178.08s]  So now let me take a little bit of inventory
[10178.08s -> 10180.08s]  and figure out what the hell I want to do here
[10180.08s -> 10182.08s]  because now I have some options. So
[10182.08s -> 10187.46s]  I got the West office
[10187.46s -> 10189.46s]  is number one
[10189.46s -> 10191.82s]  because I have the key, the code
[10191.82s -> 10194.00s]  to the save. So let's do that right now.
[10194.00s -> 10197.58s]  What was it? 915?
[10197.58s -> 10206.10s]  Something else? 915
[10208.10s -> 10213.15s]  Somebody's in the office.
[10213.15s -> 10215.15s]  I'm going to have to blow this guy's head up with a shotgun, aren't I?
[10215.15s -> 10217.15s]  No, I'm not.
[10217.15s -> 10236.70s]  Shit!
[10236.70s -> 10242.14s]  Are you watching? I hope you're watching.
[10252.18s -> 10254.18s]  I got two on me! Am I dead?
[10256.98s -> 10262.61s]  Nah, I just saved it. Kill me.
[10262.61s -> 10266.50s]  Load game. What?
[10266.50s -> 10278.90s]  Is this one right here? Use the shotgun?
[10278.90s -> 10280.90s]  No, I can't. I need to only use that
[10280.90s -> 10292.42s]  for scary enemies. And save
[10292.42s -> 10294.42s]  scum. Oh, if I have the opportunity to, I have to,
[10294.42s -> 10296.42s]  man!
[10296.42s -> 10303.76s]  Don't get me angry
[10303.76s -> 10305.76s]  in a video game like this. Alright, nine.
[10305.76s -> 10310.30s]  It was left nine, right fifteen.
[10310.30s -> 10316.90s]  Left what?
[10316.90s -> 10318.90s]  Left...
[10318.90s -> 10322.16s]  Don't be fake numbers.
[10322.16s -> 10334.50s]  Four, five, six, seven.
[10334.50s -> 10336.50s]  Guys, it didn't tell me to go to those numbers.
[10336.50s -> 10338.50s]  It told me to turn the dials
[10338.50s -> 10340.80s]  that amount of times.
[10340.80s -> 10342.80s]  Big brain up here.
[10342.80s -> 10345.36s]  Got a big brain up here.
[10345.36s -> 10350.74s]  Nice. Alright, I got that.
[10350.74s -> 10352.98s]  Let's head back to the other room.
[10352.98s -> 10356.18s]  Excuse me.
[10356.18s -> 10358.18s]  It's open now. I'm not sure what else to do
[10358.18s -> 10360.18s]  for after that. Maybe I'll explore
[10360.18s -> 10362.18s]  a place that I haven't gone before.
[10362.18s -> 10370.50s]  Who puts a pouch in a safe?
[10370.50s -> 10373.36s]  Some fucking dummy.
[10373.36s -> 10376.56s]  Okay.
[10376.56s -> 10382.19s]  Open and locks and talking about
[10382.19s -> 10384.19s]  cocks. That's a great...
[10384.19s -> 10386.19s]  Actually, that is a great title for this stream.
[10386.19s -> 10393.09s]  Now, got an extra pouch.
[10393.09s -> 10397.49s]  Sink.
[10397.49s -> 10401.20s]  I do have the detonator.
[10401.20s -> 10405.49s]  Hmm. The detonator was up.
[10405.49s -> 10407.49s]  What room was that in?
[10407.49s -> 10410.37s]  Safe.
[10410.37s -> 10412.37s]  Jack.
[10412.37s -> 10416.46s]  A hundred.
[10416.46s -> 10418.64s]  A hundred dollars.
[10418.64s -> 10421.14s]  Again.
[10421.14s -> 10423.14s]  First, La Cranda.
[10423.14s -> 10425.14s]  Now, G-Bot. H-D-H-F-E.
[10425.14s -> 10428.46s]  Thank you for the hundred dollars.
[10428.46s -> 10433.65s]  Thank you.
[10433.65s -> 10435.65s]  It says, Hey, Jerma, if you got genderbent into a female version of you,
[10435.65s -> 10437.65s]  would you mess with the tallux and seduce him?
[10437.65s -> 10441.10s]  What? What?
[10441.10s -> 10448.00s]  I don't think
[10448.00s -> 10450.18s]  I would do that.
[10450.18s -> 10458.62s]  I wouldn't do that to tallux.
[10458.62s -> 10460.62s]  But thank you so much for the hundred dollars.
[10460.62s -> 10466.51s]  I really appreciate it.
[10466.51s -> 10473.81s]  Imagine giving money to this
[10473.81s -> 10476.50s]  evil man.
[10476.50s -> 10487.18s]  What are you talking about?
[10487.18s -> 10491.54s]  But anyways, I really appreciate the hundred fucking dollars.
[10491.54s -> 10495.25s]  You know what?
[10495.25s -> 10497.25s]  You know what would happen if I...
[10497.25s -> 10500.45s]  I'll give you an answer. If that would have happened,
[10500.45s -> 10502.45s]  I would just be the same person I am right now.
[10502.45s -> 10505.89s]  What would change?
[10505.89s -> 10516.94s]  Not much. Alright, save it.
[10516.94s -> 10520.21s]  Alright, so.
[10520.21s -> 10522.38s]  We're gonna go back to the detonator room.
[10522.38s -> 10529.92s]  Which is up here. Right?
[10529.92s -> 10531.92s]  Combat knife in there. We got
[10531.92s -> 10534.42s]  pirate room.
[10534.42s -> 10538.00s]  Crank handle slot.
[10538.00s -> 10540.00s]  I have not been in this area.
[10540.00s -> 10542.00s]  But I don't know if I can. I need the crank to get up here.
[10542.00s -> 10544.00s]  So I can't really go over here.
[10544.00s -> 10547.46s]  Um.
[10547.46s -> 10551.55s]  I feel like I have to do something with this.
[10551.55s -> 10554.05s]  Or maybe up another floor?
[10554.05s -> 10558.34s]  Dial lock?
[10558.34s -> 10561.47s]  What do I bring the detonator?
[10561.47s -> 10563.47s]  What was that message where the guy was like, I've done it!
[10563.47s -> 10565.47s]  I dropped them away! And I need a battery!
[10565.47s -> 10571.73s]  I don't know. I'm gonna go upstairs.
[10571.73s -> 10579.54s]  That's where I feel like I need to be.
[10579.54s -> 10590.14s]  Shower. Let's go up.
[10590.14s -> 10592.64s]  How we doing on ammo? Good?
[10592.64s -> 10594.64s]  Yes, sir. I have
[10594.64s -> 10596.64s]  lots of ammo. So,
[10596.64s -> 10598.64s]  we gotta go up, up, up, up, up.
[10598.64s -> 10601.33s]  Shut up.
[10601.33s -> 10603.33s]  You're not even fucking funny. You're stupid.
[10603.33s -> 10605.33s]  Nice.
[10605.33s -> 10607.33s]  I deserve it for fucking just trying to make a joke for no reason.
[10607.33s -> 10609.33s]  Just gotta get
[10609.33s -> 10611.33s]  no fucking reason. I don't know what the hell
[10611.33s -> 10613.33s]  that was. Somebody was, I was trying to make a new 2019
[10613.33s -> 10615.33s]  meme.
[10615.33s -> 10617.33s]  I don't know what I was doing. I can't tell you why
[10617.33s -> 10620.46s]  I did that. You gotta be very
[10620.46s -> 10622.46s]  careful in this game. And you can't just do that.
[10622.46s -> 10624.46s]  I don't know what the hell I was doing.
[10624.46s -> 10640.13s]  Alright.
[10640.13s -> 10642.13s]  Where do I put this detonator? It was this room.
[10642.13s -> 10645.78s]  It's dead.
[10645.78s -> 10655.87s]  Right here?
[10655.87s -> 10659.39s]  Right here. Alright, detonator.
[10659.39s -> 10662.14s]  Use. Confirm.
[10662.14s -> 10665.09s]  That's got ten seconds.
[10665.09s -> 10672.64s]  Does the whole room explode? Or just
[10672.64s -> 10684.03s]  That angered somebody.
[10684.03s -> 10688.64s]  Got it. Final medallion.
[10688.64s -> 10691.90s]  Wait, what's on the other side?
[10691.90s -> 10701.25s]  Okay. I just need to look at
[10701.25s -> 10703.74s]  the thing. It is
[10703.74s -> 10705.74s]  face, arrow, snake.
[10705.74s -> 10710.03s]  Face, a
[10710.03s -> 10713.94s]  arrow, snake.
[10713.94s -> 10719.31s]  It's the blind ones. Be quiet.
[10719.31s -> 10723.28s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[10723.28s -> 10726.29s]  Alright, I got them all. Nothing
[10726.29s -> 10728.29s]  else in here. I gotta go right down
[10728.29s -> 10734.82s]  into the main hall. Just one.
[10734.82s -> 10736.82s]  Don't have to worry about it. Don't have to freak out about it.
[10736.82s -> 10740.91s]  Just go straight.
[10740.91s -> 10742.91s]  I can't believe
[10742.91s -> 10744.91s]  that there's
[10744.91s -> 10746.91s]  one of those things in here.
[10746.91s -> 10760.66s]  When I say exit.
[10760.66s -> 10765.71s]  Oh, shotgun. Give me the shotgun.
[10765.71s -> 10774.16s]  Will you fucking die?
[10774.16s -> 10776.53s]  Oh.
[10776.53s -> 10778.53s]  Is it dead? Does it get up?
[10778.53s -> 10780.53s]  It doesn't get up, does it?
[10780.53s -> 10788.51s]  Fuck out of my way. I don't even care.
[10788.51s -> 10794.72s]  I just started the
[10794.72s -> 10798.94s]  I just sang that song from Sia.
[10798.94s -> 10805.47s]  The chandelier one.
[10805.47s -> 10808.03s]  We're not gonna go that way.
[10810.03s -> 10822.82s]  I need this.
[10822.82s -> 10824.82s]  No. Why would you have anything like that in the game?
[10824.82s -> 10826.82s]  Of all the things to have in the game.
[10826.82s -> 10832.13s]  Come on. That's horse shit.
[10832.13s -> 10836.42s]  So we gotta go down
[10836.42s -> 10839.62s]  and then back to the main hall.
[10839.62s -> 10846.46s]  Just go this way, right?
[10846.46s -> 10848.46s]  Main hall is just around the corner and back.
[10848.46s -> 10851.66s]  But where's this combat knife?
[10851.66s -> 10856.98s]  I don't care.
[10856.98s -> 10863.44s]  Save it first
[10863.44s -> 10865.44s]  because something's gonna happen. The boss is gonna drop down
[10865.44s -> 10869.34s]  in the middle of the thing.
[10869.34s -> 10871.34s]  Nemesis is gonna show up and I'm gonna
[10871.34s -> 10873.34s]  scream. You're gonna get a YouTuber scream.
[10873.34s -> 10875.34s]  You already have like five of them.
[10875.34s -> 10877.34s]  And I sang like a YouTuber. Oh my god.
[10877.34s -> 10882.21s]  Something's attacking him. YouTuber sound.
[10882.21s -> 10896.98s]  Alright. Let's put it in.
[10896.98s -> 10900.37s]  He's still alive? He'll get up after this
[10900.37s -> 10903.70s]  and I'll have to shoot him.
[10903.70s -> 10905.94s]  Alright. Put a three in.
[10905.94s -> 10907.94s]  One, two, three. One, two, three.
[10907.94s -> 10910.56s]  One, two, three. One, two, three.
[10910.56s -> 10912.56s]  I can't get it out of my head.
[10912.56s -> 10915.06s]  One, two, three. One, two, three.
[10915.06s -> 10923.18s]  Is he gonna get up?
[10923.18s -> 10929.70s]  I don't think so. He probably will.
[10929.70s -> 10940.90s]  It's gonna be a cutscene right here.
[10940.90s -> 10943.07s]  So it goes underground.
[10943.07s -> 10945.50s]  That's it. That's our way out.
[10945.50s -> 10947.50s]  Lieutenant Branagh!
[10947.50s -> 10951.73s]  Marvin!
[10951.73s -> 10954.86s]  It's time to go.
[10954.86s -> 10958.45s]  We need to get you
[10958.45s -> 10960.45s]  to a hospital right now.
[10960.45s -> 10962.45s]  Hospital? I think that's gonna help.
[10962.45s -> 10965.07s]  Save yourself.
[10965.07s -> 10967.07s]  You need to shoot me.
[10967.07s -> 10970.08s]  Look, we can still make it out of here together.
[10970.08s -> 10973.47s]  It's too late.
[10973.47s -> 10977.95s]  I tried, Leon.
[10977.95s -> 10981.28s]  But I couldn't stop it.
[10981.28s -> 10985.12s]  We can't let this thing spread.
[10985.12s -> 10987.87s]  It's on you now.
[10987.87s -> 10991.07s]  Just go!
[10991.07s -> 10998.24s]  I understand.
[10998.24s -> 11008.67s]  Jerm is crying.
[11016.10s -> 11019.04s]  It won't let you down, Marvin.
[11019.04s -> 11046.93s]  What a fucking actor!
[11046.93s -> 11058.26s]  Gunpowder. Got it.
[11058.26s -> 11062.10s]  This is the new little save point here.
[11062.10s -> 11071.36s]  I need help. Heartless streamer
[11071.36s -> 11074.11s]  tries to make himself cry.
[11074.11s -> 11076.11s]  What you meant to say was
[11076.11s -> 11078.11s]  incredibly talented actor shows his skill
[11078.11s -> 11083.81s]  and craft on stream.
[11083.81s -> 11085.81s]  Nowhere I were in the secret room and there's a T-bar
[11085.81s -> 11090.10s]  handle slot over here.
[11090.10s -> 11092.10s]  I don't have a T-bar. I don't have a bell.
[11092.10s -> 11098.82s]  What about the gem?
[11098.82s -> 11100.82s]  I'm just carrying the gem around still for some reason.
[11100.82s -> 11107.46s]  Let's go.
[11107.46s -> 11129.66s]  Bringing the bell.
[11129.66s -> 11142.72s]  Take out the gun.
[11142.72s -> 11153.15s]  Two ways to go. Let's go down.
[11153.15s -> 11157.23s]  Floor. Hand grenade.
[11157.23s -> 11160.24s]  This is going to kill me.
[11160.24s -> 11162.24s]  This is going to bounce back and hit me in the face.
[11162.24s -> 11164.24s]  Equip on the inventory screen to use.
[11164.24s -> 11166.24s]  Guaranteed to kill enemies within its blast radius.
[11166.24s -> 11168.24s]  Guaranteed to kill its enemies in its blast radius.
[11168.24s -> 11171.25s]  I got a guarantee.
[11175.09s -> 11177.65s]  I can't open that at all.
[11177.65s -> 11179.65s]  I need some type of key or device.
[11179.65s -> 11184.96s]  Nothing else in here.
[11184.96s -> 11187.39s]  Am I still hurt?
[11187.39s -> 11189.39s]  That's my health. Fuck, I am hurt.
[11189.39s -> 11197.18s]  Is this open? No.
[11197.18s -> 11199.42s]  Locked. Back up the stairs.
[11199.42s -> 11201.42s]  Sure.
[11201.42s -> 11209.30s]  Which takes us to...
[11209.30s -> 11211.92s]  This is the only way I can go.
[11211.92s -> 11217.87s]  Somebody up there?
[11217.87s -> 11221.20s]  Somebody's walking up top.
[11221.20s -> 11230.86s]  Boiler room.
[11230.86s -> 11232.86s]  Probably an item somewhere, right?
[11232.86s -> 11246.82s]  Machinery room.
[11246.82s -> 11249.25s]  Only one way to go.
[11251.25s -> 11261.86s]  Me?
[11261.86s -> 11269.79s]  That's me!
[11269.79s -> 11271.79s]  They took me and this is my DNA.
[11271.79s -> 11276.46s]  Where the fuck are we going?
[11276.46s -> 11283.25s]  Oh well, now it wants to go.
[11283.25s -> 11285.25s]  It wants me to go.
[11285.25s -> 11288.26s]  You gotta...
[11288.26s -> 11290.26s]  Where the fuck?
[11290.26s -> 11294.99s]  Boss? I'm finding a boss.
[11294.99s -> 11303.12s]  Are you going to give me a red herb right now?
[11303.12s -> 11307.09s]  I need healing.
[11307.09s -> 11309.33s]  What is this? Box?
[11309.33s -> 11311.33s]  Oh shit, what do I do about this?
[11311.33s -> 11313.33s]  What do I do? What do I do?
[11313.33s -> 11322.03s]  What do I do? What do I do?
[11322.03s -> 11324.03s]  Steam? I have to blast him with steam in the face.
[11324.03s -> 11337.98s]  Guaranteed grenade.
[11337.98s -> 11347.76s]  Blast him with steam.
[11347.76s -> 11350.58s]  Blast him with steam.
[11350.58s -> 11352.58s]  There's got to be something I can do to blast him, right?
[11352.58s -> 11361.78s]  Nothing to blast him.
[11361.78s -> 11370.93s]  I'll give you a blast.
[11370.93s -> 11377.02s]  You have a gun. I know, but I just want to see if there's an environmental blast.
[11377.02s -> 11379.02s]  Should I just combine these two? I'm not going to use the heal.
[11379.02s -> 11385.74s]  Just do it. Fuck it. Do it.
[11385.74s -> 11388.18s]  Don't heal. Not going to use it. Don't need it.
[11388.18s -> 11407.36s]  Where is he?
[11407.36s -> 11410.75s]  I see. I see. Right there.
[11410.75s -> 11415.49s]  Oh shit, I didn't see it.
[11415.49s -> 11417.49s]  No, he's got an eye. He's got an eye right there.
[11445.76s -> 11463.66s]  Oh fuck!
[11471.23s -> 11473.23s]  What? Show me the eye.
[11473.23s -> 11476.18s]  Where's the fucking eye?
[11476.18s -> 11489.87s]  Where's the eye?
[11489.87s -> 11531.66s]  Do you even eye up your ass or something? I don't get it.
[11531.66s -> 11533.66s]  Oh shit, where am I going?
[11533.66s -> 11536.35s]  I turned around twice.
[11536.35s -> 11538.35s]  I'm dead. See you later.
[11538.35s -> 11540.53s]  Goodbye.
[11540.53s -> 11544.88s]  Now I play as him. That was scripted.
[11544.88s -> 11549.73s]  Okay, so eye opens up.
[11549.73s -> 11553.04s]  Shoot eye and run away.
[11553.04s -> 11555.47s]  And then just kill guy.
[11555.47s -> 11559.63s]  Shoot eye.
[11559.63s -> 11562.32s]  Okay.
[11562.32s -> 11564.62s]  I probably should get the first aid, but we'll see.
[11564.62s -> 11566.62s]  Use grenade. Yeah, I understand.
[11566.62s -> 11572.88s]  Can't go through there.
[11572.88s -> 11574.88s]  Just unlocking it.
[11574.88s -> 11586.06s]  I'm going to save again.
[11586.06s -> 11588.06s]  Should I just go back up?
[11588.06s -> 11592.72s]  Let me see.
[11592.72s -> 11601.49s]  Oh shit.
[11601.49s -> 11603.49s]  Should I just go back up?
[11603.49s -> 11605.49s]  Let me see. Did I not bring the other...
[11605.49s -> 11607.49s]  I thought I had one more first aid spray.
[11607.49s -> 11609.92s]  Apparently not.
[11609.92s -> 11613.38s]  I gotta go now.
[11613.38s -> 11615.38s]  Just beat him. It's not going to be a problem.
[11615.38s -> 11619.78s]  Just fucking beat him.
[11619.78s -> 11629.70s]  I'm good.
[11629.70s -> 11634.82s]  Fuck, now I get some other way.
[11634.82s -> 11638.08s]  Left eye, middle eye, right eye, fire.
[11638.08s -> 11641.34s]  At least now I know what to do.
[11641.34s -> 11643.34s]  Alright, area, walk along.
[11643.34s -> 11648.98s]  It really is nemesis.
[11648.98s -> 11650.98s]  Just don't waste shots on him for no reason.
[11650.98s -> 11654.37s]  I don't even have an opportunity to shoot.
[11654.37s -> 11659.36s]  Alright, here we go.
[11659.36s -> 11661.36s]  FurtBernanda has 20 community subs.
[11661.36s -> 11663.36s]  Thank you so much Furt.
[11663.36s -> 11666.11s]  That's a shitload.
[11666.11s -> 11668.99s]  That is an absolute shitload of subs.
[11668.99s -> 11676.16s]  Thank you.
[11676.16s -> 11678.16s]  Always shoot in her mouth.
[11678.16s -> 11681.55s]  Not in this game.
[11681.55s -> 11683.98s]  Alright, let's do it.
[11683.98s -> 11686.29s]  Thank you so much Furt.
[11686.29s -> 11688.29s]  Congratulations to all the community subs.
[11688.29s -> 11692.62s]  I tell you.
[11692.62s -> 11694.62s]  Alright, shoot eye.
[11694.62s -> 11696.62s]  Not yet.
[11696.62s -> 11698.62s]  There's a heal right behind me.
[11698.62s -> 11700.80s]  Let's go get the heal.
[11700.80s -> 11708.46s]  Right here.
[11708.46s -> 11710.46s]  This is not a heal, but...
[11710.46s -> 11715.97s]  Which way are you going?
[11715.97s -> 11719.23s]  Alright, which way is he? I don't know which way he is.
[11719.23s -> 11728.38s]  And go, take it, use it.
[11728.38s -> 11736.26s]  Where you at?
[11736.26s -> 11746.03s]  I know how to combine, yes.
[11746.03s -> 11748.03s]  Alright, where the hell did you go?
[11748.03s -> 11750.85s]  Is he up top? Where the fuck is he?
[11750.85s -> 11762.88s]  That eye ain't opened yet.
[11762.88s -> 11769.84s]  What's it going to take?
[11769.84s -> 11774.19s]  Open your eye.
[11774.19s -> 11794.35s]  Open that eye.
[11794.35s -> 11796.35s]  Don't crush my head again.
[11796.35s -> 11813.76s]  You gotta wait for the second swing.
[11813.76s -> 11815.76s]  He swings twice.
[11815.76s -> 11822.59s]  Get the heal.
[11822.59s -> 11825.02s]  Come on.
[11825.02s -> 11827.02s]  I'm dead.
[11827.02s -> 11829.26s]  Am I dead here?
[11853.04s -> 11856.30s]  Steam. I didn't do that.
[11856.30s -> 11865.52s]  Blast him right here, right?
[11865.52s -> 11867.52s]  What's going on?
[11867.52s -> 11869.52s]  Is he getting steamed?
[11869.52s -> 11886.61s]  Wow.
[11886.61s -> 11893.38s]  Where's the eye?
[11893.38s -> 11896.64s]  Oh shit, that's a wall behind me.
[11896.64s -> 11898.64s]  Oh my god, why is he doing this to me?
[11898.64s -> 11900.94s]  He's running so fast.
[11900.94s -> 11908.50s]  Open your eye.
[11914.77s -> 11916.77s]  Goodbye.
[11916.77s -> 11929.17s]  Which way did he go?
[11929.17s -> 11937.10s]  Is he smart? Is he going to like,
[11937.10s -> 11940.05s]  wrap around this way?
[11947.20s -> 11957.10s]  He's going...
[11957.10s -> 11959.10s]  Don't go that way.
[11966.77s -> 11975.09s]  Don't get stuck here.
[11975.09s -> 11977.09s]  Are we getting even more steam in here?
[11977.09s -> 11979.71s]  Oh fuck.
[11988.85s -> 11994.14s]  Jeremy!
[11994.14s -> 12019.02s]  We're going to transform.
[12021.02s -> 12030.10s]  That was pretty cool.
[12030.10s -> 12034.32s]  That was fun. Phase two.
[12034.32s -> 12040.38s]  Somebody's watching me.
[12040.38s -> 12042.38s]  Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't
[12042.38s -> 12044.38s]  leave anything here. I did.
[12044.38s -> 12047.39s]  In the corner there is a grenade.
[12047.39s -> 12052.50s]  But it didn't pick up.
[12052.50s -> 12060.99s]  Right there.
[12060.99s -> 12063.81s]  Let's reload the guns.
[12063.81s -> 12065.81s]  I got plenty of ammo left.
[12065.81s -> 12079.36s]  That's good.
[12079.36s -> 12083.07s]  Very cool.
[12083.07s -> 12089.90s]  Gunpowder.
[12089.90s -> 12095.73s]  Looks like a whole lot of nothing.
[12095.73s -> 12098.29s]  What's my health at right now?
[12098.29s -> 12101.87s]  Fine. Jeremy smells like Minecraft Steve.
[12101.87s -> 12106.48s]  I don't know what that means.
[12106.48s -> 12116.02s]  Like a piece of plastic?
[12116.02s -> 12118.26s]  Like a brick?
[12118.26s -> 12126.45s]  Minecraft Steve's not going to prison.
[12126.45s -> 12128.45s]  All the people in Minecraft that made out of blocks and shit, right?
[12128.45s -> 12134.02s]  Is he going to make a bridge to go across?
[12141.50s -> 12145.22s]  Minecraft Steve is more real than you.
[12145.22s -> 12147.22s]  What?
[12147.22s -> 12151.63s]  Minecraft Steve is made out of clay.
[12151.63s -> 12153.63s]  He's made out of dirt blocks.
[12153.63s -> 12164.18s]  So are you.
[12164.18s -> 12171.15s]  Yeah?
[12171.15s -> 12173.15s]  Have you ever seen somebody with this much like stretchy neck skin before?
[12173.15s -> 12180.06s]  When I'm like 60 I'm going to have to get that
[12180.06s -> 12190.37s]  taken care of.
[12190.37s -> 12194.72s]  Okay. Let's see. I have a lot of red herbs.
[12194.72s -> 12196.72s]  I feel like I'm going to need them for poison later.
[12196.72s -> 12204.85s]  Keep this in the inventory.
[12204.85s -> 12208.56s]  That looks good.
[12208.56s -> 12211.70s]  What about, take the boards.
[12211.70s -> 12215.90s]  I feel like I'm going to need them.
[12215.90s -> 12217.90s]  He doesn't know what red herbs do.
[12217.90s -> 12220.08s]  Yes I do. It's poison.
[12220.08s -> 12222.32s]  Red and green is anti-poison.
[12222.32s -> 12224.32s]  Red and blue is constitution.
[12224.32s -> 12226.32s]  Which I have no idea what that does.
[12226.32s -> 12228.32s]  That's not what it does.
[12228.32s -> 12233.17s]  That's incorrect.
[12233.17s -> 12236.30s]  Are you sure?
[12236.30s -> 12238.30s]  Do you have the game manual in front of you?
[12238.30s -> 12265.74s]  Because I don't.
[12265.74s -> 12270.22s]  Blue is poison.
[12270.22s -> 12275.07s]  Nice. Another pouch.
[12275.07s -> 12277.07s]  This just makes the game so much better.
[12277.07s -> 12281.94s]  Streamer admits he was wrong.
[12281.94s -> 12283.94s]  I will admit when I'm wrong.
[12283.94s -> 12286.11s]  Of course I will.
[12286.11s -> 12288.11s]  Can somebody with this much neck skin tell you
[12288.11s -> 12290.11s]  be right all the time?
[12290.11s -> 12299.82s]  No.
[12299.82s -> 12303.22s]  That means I can take, I'll take the jewel.
[12303.22s -> 12309.60s]  Okay.
[12309.60s -> 12316.19s]  You know that I'm a reptilian.
[12319.90s -> 12321.90s]  I watched his eyes during the stream
[12321.90s -> 12325.36s]  and they were going like this.
[12325.36s -> 12328.37s]  And they turned green for a second.
[12328.37s -> 12342.88s]  See Leon's eyes there?
[12342.88s -> 12344.88s]  They went like...
[12344.88s -> 12361.23s]  Parking garage.
[12361.23s -> 12364.62s]  So three and a half hours ago
[12364.62s -> 12366.62s]  I was going to save this.
[12366.62s -> 12368.62s]  And we had internet problems
[12368.62s -> 12370.62s]  and we seem to be okay now.
[12370.62s -> 12372.62s]  So the thing I was going to say back when I was like
[12372.62s -> 12374.62s]  I want to make this, I've got something I've got to say.
[12374.62s -> 12376.62s]  So in the original game there was an NPC
[12376.62s -> 12378.62s]  who was the gun store owner.
[12378.62s -> 12380.86s]  And I was really...
[12380.86s -> 12384.45s]  Did they omit that from the game?
[12384.45s -> 12386.45s]  Because he was my favorite NPC of the game.
[12386.45s -> 12389.78s]  The guy that goes, who are you?
[12389.78s -> 12392.14s]  And what are you doing here?
[12392.14s -> 12394.14s]  It better be the same voice actor.
[12394.14s -> 12396.14s]  They better have just taken that same audio file and put it over him.
[12396.14s -> 12400.22s]  That's in Claire's campaign?
[12400.22s -> 12406.03s]  Oh, that's too bad.
[12406.03s -> 12408.03s]  I think I'm going to restart the game in place Claire.
[12408.03s -> 12413.15s]  Alright, big open space.
[12413.15s -> 12415.15s]  There's probably going to be something that jumps out here.
[12415.15s -> 12421.30s]  This door looks locked.
[12421.30s -> 12423.30s]  And it is.
[12423.30s -> 12444.59s]  Don't go too fast.
[12444.59s -> 12451.44s]  Probably a liquor or something.
[12451.44s -> 12453.44s]  The guy in the trash? No.
[12453.44s -> 12459.52s]  Item in the trash? No.
[12459.52s -> 12461.52s]  There's two more doors. That door's locked.
[12461.52s -> 12467.46s]  They're all locked.
[12467.46s -> 12472.90s]  Okay. Hmm.
[12472.90s -> 12484.02s]  All of them are locked.
[12484.02s -> 12487.79s]  Fuse box? No.
[12487.79s -> 12491.70s]  Parking garage ticket? I don't have one.
[12491.70s -> 12494.62s]  Cut scene.
[12494.62s -> 12515.62s]  Boom!
[12515.62s -> 12517.62s]  Bob's face is going to get blown up right here.
[12517.62s -> 12519.62s]  From the trailer. Thank you very much.
[12519.62s -> 12523.71s]  Hey! Who is that?
[12523.71s -> 12527.34s]  Stay sharp.
[12527.34s -> 12535.33s]  Who is it? Ada!
[12535.33s -> 12537.50s]  Yep. Oh yeah.
[12537.50s -> 12541.47s]  FBI. Sorry.
[12541.47s -> 12546.00s]  Thank you. For your help.
[12546.00s -> 12551.18s]  I'm surprised you made it this far.
[12551.18s -> 12554.70s]  FBI, huh? What's going on here?
[12554.70s -> 12556.70s]  Sorry. That information's classified.
[12556.70s -> 12558.70s]  Where you going?
[12558.70s -> 12562.67s]  Do yourself a favor.
[12562.67s -> 12564.91s]  Stop asking questions and get the hell out of here.
[12564.91s -> 12570.10s]  I'm too appreciated to emotes.
[12570.10s -> 12572.10s]  Saturn?
[12572.10s -> 12574.66s]  Oh, by the way.
[12574.66s -> 12576.96s]  Just wanted to let everybody know because
[12576.96s -> 12578.96s]  there's people here, right?
[12578.96s -> 12581.44s]  The
[12581.44s -> 12583.44s]  t-shirts that I've been talking about. Remember I told you that
[12583.44s -> 12585.44s]  before January was over
[12585.44s -> 12588.51s]  the shirts are going up tomorrow.
[12588.51s -> 12590.75s]  So the shirts will be launching
[12590.75s -> 12592.75s]  if not tomorrow then Wednesday. I'm going to try to get it to work.
[12592.75s -> 12594.75s]  Try to launch the t-shirts.
[12594.75s -> 12597.31s]  Two of them. Glue Man's
[12597.31s -> 12599.31s]  coming back. And the solar system.
[12599.31s -> 12602.00s]  Because somebody brought up the solar system.
[12602.00s -> 12604.00s]  So that's going to happen tomorrow or Wednesday.
[12604.00s -> 12606.00s]  I've not figured it out yet. Make sure I get it
[12606.00s -> 12608.50s]  ready to go. But yeah.
[12608.50s -> 12610.50s]  And they will be there permanently.
[12610.50s -> 12612.50s]  So no more
[12612.50s -> 12614.50s]  three week campaigns.
[12614.50s -> 12617.57s]  And the Glue Man shirt is going to be in like
[12617.57s -> 12620.32s]  three colors. Get it if you
[12620.32s -> 12623.65s]  feel like it whenever you want. How much money
[12623.65s -> 12625.89s]  for a shirt? 20 bucks.
[12625.89s -> 12628.51s]  Or like, yeah.
[12628.51s -> 12631.65s]  Probably 20 bucks. Because I think
[12631.65s -> 12633.65s]  there's like different... I was
[12633.65s -> 12635.65s]  trying to talk to somebody at Teespring because
[12635.65s -> 12638.34s]  three years
[12638.34s -> 12640.34s]  ago when I made the shirt the first time.
[12640.34s -> 12642.96s]  It was... There's different like t-shirt
[12642.96s -> 12644.96s]  material. You can do like premium shirts
[12644.96s -> 12646.96s]  that cost more. I don't know. I
[12646.96s -> 12648.96s]  have to like look into that. But it probably
[12648.96s -> 12650.96s]  will not be more than 20 dollars.
[12650.96s -> 12652.96s]  For sure. So. There you go.
[12652.96s -> 12656.35s]  Do I accept what
[12656.35s -> 12658.35s]  coins? I don't know what that means.
[12658.35s -> 12662.96s]  Nah. A shirt on this channel
[12662.96s -> 12664.96s]  would never be more than like 22 to 25
[12664.96s -> 12666.96s]  dollars. But I'm not going to need to do that.
[12666.96s -> 12668.96s]  It'll be 20 bucks. For sure.
[12668.96s -> 12671.90s]  So where am I going?
[12671.90s -> 12675.10s]  Well, hold on. This door opened. Both doors
[12675.10s -> 12677.10s]  just opened. I could follow...
[12677.10s -> 12679.10s]  I'll follow her out. See where...
[12679.10s -> 12682.56s]  Whatever. Let's go this way. He's already
[12682.56s -> 12685.44s]  raising the prices! I just said
[12685.44s -> 12693.89s]  20 bucks. Okay. This opens that.
[12693.89s -> 12696.45s]  Which brings me to the
[12696.45s -> 12698.45s]  jail. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[12698.45s -> 12704.02s]  Police station B1 map.
[12704.02s -> 12709.95s]  Nice. A lot of bullets.
[12715.20s -> 12721.66s]  Oh. Minimum bit... Oh, I see what you're saying.
[12721.66s -> 12724.14s]  No.
[12724.14s -> 12726.38s]  We talked about it why. We talked about
[12726.38s -> 12731.82s]  why before. Don't just...
[12731.82s -> 12734.70s]  Wait. Go save the game. Can I get
[12734.70s -> 12736.70s]  like a save point in the jail somewhere?
[12736.70s -> 12743.68s]  You're going to break this open.
[12743.68s -> 12745.86s]  I know you are. Should I just
[12745.86s -> 12756.10s]  take care of it? They're all
[12756.10s -> 12758.85s]  going to open. Just watch.
[12758.85s -> 12765.63s]  All these damn things are going to open.
[12765.63s -> 12784.64s]  That's going to open
[12784.64s -> 12786.64s]  them. So I need to have an escape
[12786.64s -> 12789.33s]  route here. Doesn't look like
[12789.33s -> 12791.33s]  there's any items in any of these cells.
[12791.33s -> 12794.02s]  NPC.
[12798.02s -> 12801.22s]  Hello, human. You've been here long?
[12801.22s -> 12803.46s]  Long enough. Are we
[12803.46s -> 12805.46s]  the last ones alive? No. No.
[12805.46s -> 12807.46s]  There's a few of us. That's good news
[12807.46s -> 12809.46s]  I guess. Yeah. That's of course Irons
[12809.46s -> 12811.46s]  sent you. Irons. You mean Chief Irons.
[12811.46s -> 12813.46s]  Is he still around? Who cares?
[12813.46s -> 12815.46s]  Hopefully he's somebody's dinner by now.
[12815.46s -> 12817.46s]  What do you mean by that? He's the bastard
[12817.46s -> 12819.46s]  that locked me in here. I'm sure
[12819.46s -> 12821.46s]  he had a good reason. He did.
[12821.46s -> 12825.36s]  I was about to blow
[12825.36s -> 12827.36s]  the whistle on his dirty ass. He has a full cigarette.
[12827.36s -> 12829.36s]  I added the same thing to him I guess.
[12829.36s -> 12831.73s]  Just took one hall and threw it in the trash?
[12831.73s -> 12836.08s]  On the ground? I'll make you a
[12836.08s -> 12838.08s]  deal. I'll lock this cell and I'll
[12838.08s -> 12840.08s]  give you this. Okay. There's no other way out of that parking
[12840.08s -> 12842.08s]  garage. Believe me. Sorry.
[12842.08s -> 12844.08s]  I can't do that. I have to talk
[12844.08s -> 12846.08s]  to the Chief first.
[12846.08s -> 12848.75s]  Look. We're both prisoners in this station.
[12848.75s -> 12850.75s]  I'll do it. So we can play nice
[12850.75s -> 12852.75s]  and help each other out.
[12852.75s -> 12854.75s]  Shit. It's coming.
[12854.75s -> 12856.75s]  What's coming? What's coming?
[12856.75s -> 12858.75s]  Come on. Come on. Don't be an asshole.
[12858.75s -> 12860.75s]  You need this.
[12860.75s -> 12862.75s]  Just get me the fuck out of here!
[12868.75s -> 12878.42s]  Oh, what is that? I just did a
[12878.42s -> 12881.10s]  boss. I just did
[12881.10s -> 12883.92s]  a boss. Who is that?
[12883.92s -> 12885.92s]  It was Ada!
[12885.92s -> 12887.92s]  Sorry. She's got the same
[12887.92s -> 12890.10s]  glove.
[12890.10s -> 12892.10s]  Ada, you got superpowers, huh?
[12892.10s -> 12894.10s]  Yeah, sometimes I get literally fucking mad and I
[12894.10s -> 12896.10s]  turn green. I get huge.
[12896.10s -> 12898.10s]  Just don't make me pissed off.
[12901.73s -> 12904.54s]  I don't have breakfast this morning.
[12904.54s -> 12906.54s]  Hey, you can't keep walking away from me.
[12906.54s -> 12908.54s]  I don't even know your name.
[12908.54s -> 12911.42s]  I'm Leon Kennedy.
[12911.42s -> 12914.18s]  No.
[12914.18s -> 12917.57s]  Find a way out, Leon,
[12917.57s -> 12922.30s]  before it's too late.
[12922.30s -> 12924.30s]  You're really gonna give me your full hand there.
[12924.30s -> 12926.93s]  Just say my name is L.
[12926.93s -> 12928.93s]  Name's Ada.
[12928.93s -> 12930.93s]  Okay, that's a start.
[12930.93s -> 12932.93s]  You give him one letter first and then you say I'll give you the
[12932.93s -> 12934.93s]  next letter when I see you again if you give me your first
[12934.93s -> 12936.93s]  letter. Well, I guess the deal's on.
[12936.93s -> 12938.93s]  All right, that's the
[12938.93s -> 12945.26s]  world. Pull the lever and
[12945.26s -> 12949.17s]  I'm home. Before I do that, let me make sure I don't miss
[12949.17s -> 12951.17s]  any items because they're all gonna open and I gotta
[12951.17s -> 12953.17s]  find out. I gotta get a perfect escape route.
[12953.17s -> 12955.17s]  So
[12955.17s -> 12957.66s]  that's the key
[12957.66s -> 12959.66s]  card to the parking garage,
[12959.66s -> 12964.21s]  which means I just gotta go right out the door
[12964.21s -> 12966.21s]  after pulling this.
[12966.21s -> 12968.45s]  So I gotta be prepared. I'm ready.
[12968.45s -> 12970.45s]  I'm ready. I'm ready. There's a
[12970.45s -> 12973.84s]  tool. It's like a crank.
[12973.84s -> 12975.84s]  I know where that goes.
[12975.84s -> 12977.84s]  Jail power panel.
[12977.84s -> 12979.84s]  I assume everyone knows, but since
[12979.84s -> 12981.84s]  the jail's power panel is old as hell,
[12981.84s -> 12983.84s]  we're gonna need those custom power panel parts
[12983.84s -> 12985.84s]  no one makes anymore.
[12985.84s -> 12987.84s]  There should be a few in the generator room.
[12987.84s -> 12993.15s]  There's only one of those power panel parts in the
[12993.15s -> 12995.46s]  generator room. The guy that's here to fix
[12995.46s -> 12997.46s]  the bell in the clock tower should have another.
[12997.46s -> 12999.46s]  So someone swipe, I mean ask nicely
[12999.46s -> 13010.40s]  for it please. So I have an unfortunate
[13010.40s -> 13013.98s]  thing to say. And it's actually
[13013.98s -> 13015.98s]  kind of, this really like sucks actually.
[13015.98s -> 13020.06s]  Remember a couple
[13020.06s -> 13022.06s]  days ago when I thought I was getting like a migraine?
[13022.06s -> 13027.38s]  And it's
[13027.38s -> 13031.66s]  happening again.
[13031.66s -> 13040.22s]  Wait, why is
[13040.22s -> 13042.22s]  this not open? I just did the power.
[13042.22s -> 13047.22s]  Does that not do anything?
[13047.22s -> 13052.45s]  Oh, okay.
[13052.45s -> 13057.76s]  Sometimes the
[13057.76s -> 13059.76s]  unfortunate truth about this is
[13059.76s -> 13061.76s]  sometimes I get like a string of headaches
[13061.76s -> 13064.19s]  and a string of like migraines
[13064.19s -> 13066.19s]  and then I'm fine. For like
[13066.19s -> 13068.19s]  another, like after a few days.
[13068.19s -> 13070.43s]  I have seen a doctor about it,
[13070.43s -> 13072.43s]  don't worry. But it's
[13072.43s -> 13076.08s]  kind of happening again.
[13076.08s -> 13081.39s]  Unfortunately. I get like a string
[13081.39s -> 13083.39s]  of like five, four or five days in a row where I'm
[13083.39s -> 13086.53s]  just really fucked up. But
[13086.53s -> 13088.96s]  I'm alright right now. But the
[13088.96s -> 13090.96s]  stream may have to do another one of those
[13090.96s -> 13093.26s]  ending before I want to.
[13093.26s -> 13096.21s]  But what can
[13096.21s -> 13098.70s]  you do, right? Electronic door
[13098.70s -> 13100.70s]  panel, it's that thing right there.
[13100.70s -> 13102.70s]  I can't use it. Let me look at that thing again.
[13102.70s -> 13106.54s]  Alright.
[13106.54s -> 13109.04s]  I'm gonna need those custom power panel parts.
[13109.04s -> 13112.37s]  Yeah, I've been sleeping fine.
[13112.37s -> 13119.22s]  Just taking aspirin.
[13119.22s -> 13122.78s]  Nah, I'll be good. Don't worry.
[13122.78s -> 13124.78s]  There should be a few in the, I gotta go to the generator room.
[13124.78s -> 13128.30s]  I got word that there's only one of those
[13128.30s -> 13130.30s]  power panel parts in the generator room. The guy that
[13130.30s -> 13132.30s]  the bell, the guy that's here to
[13132.30s -> 13134.30s]  fix the bell in the clock tower should have another.
[13134.30s -> 13136.30s]  So clock tower and then generator
[13136.30s -> 13138.61s]  room. Let's see what that is.
[13138.61s -> 13141.94s]  Generator room.
[13141.94s -> 13144.62s]  So we have to go out this way.
[13144.62s -> 13146.62s]  So back to the garage.
[13146.62s -> 13150.58s]  Get some, I've been drinking water.
[13150.58s -> 13152.58s]  I mean, I made the joke how I wouldn't get coffee again, but when I was downstairs
[13152.58s -> 13154.58s]  I had a full glass of water. So that's,
[13154.58s -> 13156.58s]  I don't think it's that.
[13156.58s -> 13164.50s]  But, yeah.
[13164.50s -> 13166.67s]  If I do end up stopping
[13166.67s -> 13168.67s]  prematurely, then
[13168.67s -> 13170.67s]  we will try it again tomorrow. We'll do it again tomorrow.
[13170.67s -> 13175.15s]  Okay, so
[13175.15s -> 13177.15s]  what other door, this door opened over here.
[13177.15s -> 13182.02s]  Make sure you have good posture.
[13182.02s -> 13185.66s]  Nah, I'm good. I'm good.
[13185.66s -> 13187.66s]  You're supposed to drink four gallons of water
[13187.66s -> 13191.12s]  a day.
[13191.12s -> 13193.12s]  That is not sound medical advice.
[13193.12s -> 13195.12s]  I will tell you.
[13195.12s -> 13198.64s]  It's a stray generator room. We can go up
[13198.64s -> 13200.64s]  here. Oh, no.
[13200.64s -> 13202.64s]  It gets down through the kennel.
[13202.64s -> 13206.29s]  Let me check over here first.
[13206.29s -> 13216.00s]  Shooting range.
[13216.00s -> 13222.58s]  Lunch box. I'm going to
[13222.58s -> 13226.67s]  examine that right now.
[13226.67s -> 13230.00s]  There's something inside.
[13230.00s -> 13233.33s]  And a well-worn key.
[13233.33s -> 13237.81s]  Equipment disposal notice.
[13237.81s -> 13241.20s]  Bent key no longer usable, but
[13241.20s -> 13243.20s]  can still open the car's doors and trunks
[13243.20s -> 13245.20s]  with its keyless entry buttons.
[13245.20s -> 13250.45s]  So it can open car doors and trunks.
[13250.45s -> 13253.97s]  That's excellent to know.
[13253.97s -> 13257.36s]  A message from Mr. Raccoon.
[13257.36s -> 13259.54s]  Howdy, boys and girls.
[13259.54s -> 13261.54s]  This is your pal from the Raccoon City Zoo. It's always great
[13261.54s -> 13263.54s]  to see you. Today I want to talk about
[13263.54s -> 13265.54s]  something really important. You know, my popular Mr.
[13265.54s -> 13267.54s]  Raccoon toys.
[13267.54s -> 13269.54s]  Well, I heard some bad kids have been using them for
[13269.54s -> 13273.12s]  target practice.
[13273.12s -> 13275.81s]  Bobbleheads, right? Good little
[13275.81s -> 13277.81s]  kids wouldn't be that mean, right?
[13277.81s -> 13279.81s]  Plus, it's super dangerous.
[13279.81s -> 13285.23s]  Bobbleheads. That sounds
[13285.23s -> 13288.24s]  like a Garfagraph.
[13288.24s -> 13292.59s]  It really does. But I'm going to assume
[13292.59s -> 13294.59s]  that's the bobbleheads of this game.
[13294.59s -> 13296.59s]  I'd probably be correct, right?
[13296.59s -> 13314.94s]  There's one right there. After you
[13314.94s -> 13316.94s]  shoot ten of them, eight of them, whatever,
[13316.94s -> 13321.87s]  you get probably a gun, right?
[13321.87s -> 13323.87s]  I'm going to get the bad ending if you shoot them. Kind of like a waste
[13323.87s -> 13325.87s]  of bullets, unless I really care, right?
[13325.87s -> 13330.86s]  Uh, can I go this way?
[13330.86s -> 13332.86s]  Yeah.
[13332.86s -> 13334.86s]  I need a diamond key.
[13334.86s -> 13338.83s]  This guy's going to get up.
[13338.83s -> 13343.57s]  Is there a reason to come in here?
[13343.57s -> 13349.84s]  Yeah, shotgun bullets. When I pick these up,
[13349.84s -> 13351.84s]  they're going to stand up. Like every
[13351.84s -> 13353.84s]  video game ever made. No, maybe not.
[13353.84s -> 13358.70s]  Nothing on either one of you?
[13358.70s -> 13364.34s]  But I was going to get my first
[13364.34s -> 13366.34s]  impressions before I got jump scared.
[13366.34s -> 13371.38s]  This is, uh,
[13371.38s -> 13373.38s]  this is very, very good. It's very, very
[13373.38s -> 13375.38s]  sound, fun gameplay.
[13375.38s -> 13378.00s]  How everything's connected and everything
[13378.00s -> 13380.00s]  you can see everything, the doors, everything makes sense.
[13380.00s -> 13382.69s]  It's very, I would,
[13382.69s -> 13384.69s]  I would, this is great. This is a very good
[13384.69s -> 13386.69s]  game so far. It's been
[13386.69s -> 13390.53s]  fantastic. This door's locked.
[13390.53s -> 13394.82s]  You're going to fall through the floor again.
[13394.82s -> 13396.82s]  Imagine, that would be ridiculous.
[13396.82s -> 13398.82s]  At that point, I knew what was going to happen.
[13398.82s -> 13400.82s]  And I'm just pretending
[13400.82s -> 13404.08s]  for the video. You know what I mean?
[13404.08s -> 13408.82s]  This is also blocked off.
[13408.82s -> 13410.82s]  So we can go on.
[13410.82s -> 13414.27s]  Got the key and the crank.
[13414.27s -> 13420.93s]  Let's go around. Just check around the other side.
[13420.93s -> 13423.10s]  Is it a shotgun?
[13423.10s -> 13425.10s]  I thought it's just an umbrella.
[13425.10s -> 13427.73s]  I was like, new shotgun just sitting on a
[13427.73s -> 13432.46s]  bench. Alright, slow down.
[13432.46s -> 13443.65s]  Okay, finally a blue
[13443.65s -> 13447.10s]  herb. We can use that.
[13447.10s -> 13453.44s]  Focus in here. Loaded, right
[13453.44s -> 13455.94s]  loaded. There's the,
[13455.94s -> 13460.99s]  gonna be dogs here.
[13460.99s -> 13466.24s]  Watch out for space. I'm running out of space.
[13466.24s -> 13477.06s]  Mmm, the dogs are gonna be so
[13477.06s -> 13479.06s]  fast too and it's gonna...
[13479.06s -> 13481.94s]  No, oh god. Oh god, just end it.
[13481.94s -> 13490.38s]  Do it!
[13490.38s -> 13492.38s]  Go, go, get out, out, out, out, out before they break out.
[13492.38s -> 13494.38s]  They're gonna break out. They're gonna, just go, go, go, go, go, go, run, run.
[13494.38s -> 13499.12s]  Just run through. Vent?
[13499.12s -> 13502.32s]  Is it a dog door? Watch out for the dog door.
[13502.32s -> 13504.62s]  Where am I?
[13504.62s -> 13516.14s]  It's actually a doggy door.
[13516.14s -> 13526.00s]  Well, here's a crank.
[13526.00s -> 13529.26s]  That'll bring it back out here.
[13529.26s -> 13531.26s]  What is out here?
[13531.26s -> 13539.18s]  There's the generator room
[13539.18s -> 13541.18s]  over there. Let me go to the morgue first.
[13541.18s -> 13545.66s]  That fucking doggy
[13545.66s -> 13554.56s]  door. Autopsy record
[13554.56s -> 13556.56s]  number 53,477.
[13556.56s -> 13558.80s]  Found
[13558.80s -> 13560.80s]  dead in jail cell, bed by
[13560.80s -> 13562.80s]  staff. Clenched due to
[13562.80s -> 13565.23s]  a rig of mortis.
[13565.23s -> 13567.23s]  Seized to his known kleptomaniac.
[13567.23s -> 13570.30s]  He would steal
[13570.30s -> 13572.30s]  even while in jail, though that was
[13572.30s -> 13574.30s]  consistent with his clinical diagnosis.
[13574.30s -> 13584.61s]  Why do I hear shit right now?
[13584.61s -> 13587.42s]  Someone's gonna break out of one of these
[13587.42s -> 13594.78s]  fucking doors. Here we go.
[13594.78s -> 13599.07s]  Somebody's gonna be on one of these dinner
[13599.07s -> 13604.51s]  plates. Ah,
[13604.51s -> 13607.65s]  fuck. Yep, he's gonna
[13607.65s -> 13617.25s]  jump out. What are you holding?
[13617.25s -> 13620.18s]  Diamond key.
[13620.18s -> 13622.67s]  Wait! I knew it, I knew it, I
[13622.67s -> 13627.86s]  knew it, I knew it.
[13627.86s -> 13632.53s]  Where did you come from?
[13632.53s -> 13644.10s]  No, I didn't,
[13644.10s -> 13646.10s]  I didn't want to do that. I keep thinking it's
[13646.10s -> 13668.29s]  knife. He's gonna, whatever.
[13668.29s -> 13670.29s]  Come on, where's the jackpot? There's gotta be something here.
[13670.29s -> 13682.13s]  Come on, give me a jackpot.
[13682.13s -> 13685.44s]  That's not a jackpot.
[13685.44s -> 13698.30s]  That's just a flash grenade.
[13698.30s -> 13701.38s]  Really? No jackpot?
[13701.38s -> 13704.05s]  What the hell
[13704.05s -> 13709.10s]  are these bugs?
[13709.10s -> 13711.10s]  Their faces? I don't know.
[13711.10s -> 13716.29s]  Red herb, I'll take it.
[13716.29s -> 13723.90s]  I can do three, though. Red,
[13723.90s -> 13725.90s]  blue, green.
[13725.90s -> 13727.90s]  Is a full superheal, right?
[13727.90s -> 13731.92s]  And that will
[13731.92s -> 13737.62s]  come out of all three of them.
[13737.62s -> 13739.62s]  That's a superheal and it's poison.
[13739.62s -> 13750.62s]  So we need to hold onto this until
[13750.62s -> 13752.62s]  we really, really need it.
[13752.62s -> 13754.62s]  It's a defense bonus poison heal superheal.
[13754.62s -> 13765.68s]  Good.
[13765.68s -> 13767.68s]  That wasn't really a jackpot, but I'll take it.
[13767.68s -> 13770.30s]  Nothing else in here.
[13770.30s -> 13777.58s]  Bullets are doing fine.
[13777.58s -> 13780.14s]  Alright, let's get to the generator
[13780.14s -> 13784.43s]  room. RGB
[13784.43s -> 13787.50s]  healing? Yeah.
[13787.50s -> 13792.22s]  Now, there's supposed to be a piece in here.
[13792.22s -> 13801.38s]  Right? Somewhere.
[13801.38s -> 13804.26s]  Box electronic part is one of
[13804.26s -> 13806.26s]  two. And then I gotta go to the clock
[13806.26s -> 13810.10s]  tower. Wherever that is.
[13810.10s -> 13812.27s]  Doggy door, you're not gonna
[13812.27s -> 13838.96s]  fucking fool me. I'm so paranoid
[13838.96s -> 13845.62s]  right now. Okay, so this is
[13845.62s -> 13847.62s]  on, on, on, on.
[13847.62s -> 13852.21s]  They're all on.
[13852.21s -> 13856.50s]  That didn't do anything. Maybe
[13856.50s -> 13858.50s]  on, off, on, on?
[13858.50s -> 13866.62s]  So they'll probably all have to be both
[13866.62s -> 13870.08s]  Okay, I see. So I think both need to be
[13870.08s -> 13872.08s]  in the red. So we got it on.
[13872.08s -> 13874.26s]  That's it, right? No, not quite.
[13874.26s -> 13880.96s]  There it is. Gotta hit that
[13880.96s -> 13893.18s]  sweet spot.
[13893.18s -> 13895.62s]  Where? I see the shadow!
[13895.62s -> 13905.28s]  One climbed over.
[13905.28s -> 13912.26s]  Hey!
[13912.26s -> 13918.59s]  There's a heal right there. Just give me the heal.
[13918.59s -> 13925.25s]  I got enough room for it. Why do I have
[13925.25s -> 13927.25s]  the boards? The boards are so useless
[13927.25s -> 13929.25s]  right now. I don't even need them.
[13929.25s -> 13932.94s]  Alright, bingo.
[13932.94s -> 13934.94s]  Where the fuck is the dog? Where is the dog?
[13934.94s -> 13937.89s]  He's sticking his head through the dog door.
[13937.89s -> 13943.46s]  Shit!
[13943.46s -> 13945.89s]  Oh, I hate it.
[13945.89s -> 13962.85s]  Where was it? Where was it?
[13962.85s -> 13983.38s]  I'm gonna shot it again.
[13983.38s -> 13985.38s]  Okay, so I gotta get out of here, then go all the way around
[13985.38s -> 13989.20s]  and up.
[13989.20s -> 13991.20s]  Oh, my fucking face!
[13991.20s -> 13995.23s]  Son of a bitch.
[13995.23s -> 14003.42s]  I know, really. Jesus!
[14003.42s -> 14005.60s]  Okay, we're good.
[14005.60s -> 14007.60s]  We're safe. That's all the dogs. No more dogs.
[14007.60s -> 14013.42s]  No more dog doors.
[14013.42s -> 14027.06s]  Is there another dog? That's what opened over here
[14027.06s -> 14032.43s]  and then bang it left.
[14032.43s -> 14034.99s]  Okay, I made it. Nothing else, right?
[14034.99s -> 14045.47s]  I think we're good.
[14045.47s -> 14051.42s]  There they go. That brings us all the way
[14051.42s -> 14054.18s]  up here. Oh, wow. We're back at
[14054.18s -> 14056.54s]  the main halls out here.
[14056.54s -> 14059.10s]  Very cool.
[14059.10s -> 14069.58s]  Combine. Key for the range.
[14069.58s -> 14079.31s]  Mission key for a car. Blade is bent.
[14079.31s -> 14083.60s]  I need to get to...
[14083.60s -> 14085.60s]  Let me get to a save point first and then I can go back.
[14085.60s -> 14087.60s]  There's like a break room here.
[14087.60s -> 14094.88s]  There we go.
[14094.88s -> 14098.40s]  This is...
[14098.40s -> 14101.60s]  Is there a storage unit in here?
[14101.60s -> 14103.60s]  Shit, there's no unit in here.
[14103.60s -> 14106.99s]  Electrical part. Shit.
[14106.99s -> 14111.73s]  Okay, I need a box.
[14111.73s -> 14115.06s]  Oh, I need a box.
[14115.06s -> 14118.05s]  Hey, look, there's a box.
[14118.05s -> 14120.05s]  Okay, so...
[14120.05s -> 14123.31s]  I store this for a second.
[14123.31s -> 14125.31s]  I just need... I gotta see what I got here.
[14125.31s -> 14127.62s]  Another key.
[14127.62s -> 14134.46s]  Still don't need the jewel yet.
[14134.46s -> 14139.97s]  I'm probably gonna need this.
[14139.97s -> 14146.03s]  Yeah, I have
[14146.03s -> 14148.27s]  the red herbs to combine with.
[14148.27s -> 14153.52s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[14153.52s -> 14157.81s]  Okay. Gunpowder. I got a gunpowder.
[14157.81s -> 14159.81s]  I can make some shotgun ammo, right?
[14159.81s -> 14161.81s]  Because I have one more. Do I have any yellow?
[14161.81s -> 14166.22s]  Yeah, I do. Shotgun ammo.
[14166.22s -> 14171.92s]  I can make some more pistol ammo.
[14171.92s -> 14179.39s]  Yeah, I'll do it. Why not?
[14179.39s -> 14184.45s]  Because then I can keep this one gunpowder.
[14184.45s -> 14186.45s]  This window is here to board. That's a good idea.
[14186.45s -> 14190.80s]  Don't need the flash.
[14190.80s -> 14192.80s]  There was another place down where I could
[14192.80s -> 14195.04s]  use this. Wasn't there
[14195.04s -> 14197.34s]  somewhere down on like the actual
[14197.34s -> 14201.76s]  floor here? I'm glad to be here.
[14201.76s -> 14204.90s]  Thank you.
[14204.90s -> 14207.26s]  Glad to have you. Thanks for sticking around.
[14207.26s -> 14211.87s]  If you don't organize it,
[14211.87s -> 14213.87s]  then I'm gonna be very mad.
[14213.87s -> 14218.67s]  See?
[14218.67s -> 14227.12s]  Got two boards,
[14227.12s -> 14229.68s]  45, car key,
[14229.68s -> 14232.82s]  and
[14232.82s -> 14235.50s]  I have to stop. I have to.
[14235.50s -> 14241.12s]  I'm sorry.
[14241.12s -> 14244.64s]  Sorry that we have to stop so early.
[14244.64s -> 14247.33s]  But, like, I can feel it now.
[14247.33s -> 14251.30s]  So. Kind of
[14251.30s -> 14253.30s]  annoying that this has kind of happened twice, two streams in a row.
[14253.30s -> 14255.47s]  But,
[14255.47s -> 14257.78s]  uh, I got another doctor's
[14257.78s -> 14259.78s]  appointment coming up. So I'm gonna
[14259.78s -> 14264.06s]  bring it up again. But,
[14264.06s -> 14266.62s]  uh, I'm fine. Don't worry.
[14266.62s -> 14269.31s]  I just kind of have like another weird
[14269.31s -> 14271.31s]  headache again. That like won't
[14271.31s -> 14273.49s]  really go away. So,
[14273.49s -> 14277.39s]  uh, I hate to
[14277.39s -> 14280.46s]  stop after four hours.
[14280.46s -> 14282.46s]  But I have to.
[14282.46s -> 14284.46s]  I don't want to just like do it.
[14284.46s -> 14286.46s]  I'd rather enjoy this and like be able to have
[14286.46s -> 14288.46s]  fun and hang out with you guys and actually
[14288.46s -> 14290.46s]  not have to think about like this.
[14290.46s -> 14293.02s]  So, uh, we're gonna try tomorrow.
[14293.02s -> 14296.10s]  We're gonna do it again tomorrow.
[14296.10s -> 14298.10s]  Uh, take care of yourselves if you're gonna take off.
[14298.10s -> 14300.10s]  I can still do the bits.
[14300.10s -> 14302.10s]  We've only been streaming for about four hours, so.
[14302.10s -> 14305.04s]  Uh, sorry
[14305.04s -> 14307.04s]  again that we have to stop.
[14307.04s -> 14309.54s]  Trust me, I want to
[14309.54s -> 14312.29s]  stream. But it's kind of annoying.
[14312.29s -> 14314.29s]  Really annoying, actually. But whatever.
[14314.29s -> 14317.10s]  You do what you gotta do, right?
[14317.10s -> 14319.10s]  Uh, thank you for watching. We're gonna just, we're gonna pick up
[14319.10s -> 14321.10s]  exactly right here tomorrow. Exactly
[14321.10s -> 14323.66s]  where we left off. And
[14323.66s -> 14325.84s]  we'll try again. Thank you
[14325.84s -> 14327.84s]  so much for your patience and understanding, everybody.
[14327.84s -> 14329.84s]  Uh, there's a lot of support
[14329.84s -> 14331.84s]  tonight, like there always is.
[14331.84s -> 14333.84s]  Much love to you. Thank you so much for coming out.
[14333.84s -> 14337.10s]  And I even had a day off yesterday, too.
[14337.10s -> 14339.73s]  I sure just streamed yesterday. I felt
[14339.73s -> 14343.68s]  fine. Whatever.
[14343.68s -> 14346.11s]  Uh, take care, guys.
[14346.11s -> 14351.74s]  Did I even feel fine? I don't remember.
[14351.74s -> 14356.93s]  I probably did.
[14356.93s -> 14362.30s]  Yesterday you said tomorrow. So
[14362.30s -> 14364.30s]  I'll see you again tomorrow. I want
[14364.30s -> 14366.30s]  I'm gonna complete this on stream because it's a great
[14366.30s -> 14369.76s]  game. I'm having a bunch of fun so far.
[14369.76s -> 14372.19s]  But let's do the bits.
[14372.19s -> 14374.19s]  This, uh, we don't have very much to go through, I don't think.
[14374.19s -> 14376.19s]  So, no, not really.
[14376.19s -> 14378.19s]  So it shouldn't take us too long.
[14378.19s -> 14383.50s]  We had, uh, Dala from
[14383.50s -> 14385.81s]  Timmy Tim Tam. Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam.
[14385.81s -> 14391.95s]  No bits. Go to bed.
[14391.95s -> 14395.98s]  No, we're okay.
[14395.98s -> 14397.98s]  We're okay. I can, I can do this.
[14397.98s -> 14400.35s]  I'll be good. There's only about
[14400.35s -> 14402.35s]  maybe 10 to 15 to go through
[14402.35s -> 14409.33s]  anyways. But let's, uh,
[14409.33s -> 14412.40s]  Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the Dala.
[14412.40s -> 14414.40s]  Uh, it's a YouTube link.
[14414.40s -> 14417.20s]  Another daily conversation in
[14417.20s -> 14419.20s]  English. See what it is.
[14419.20s -> 14421.20s]  How about a drink?
[14421.20s -> 14424.08s]  How about a drink tonight?
[14424.08s -> 14426.08s]  I'd love to. Where can we
[14426.08s -> 14428.08s]  meet? How about the Relax Bar?
[14428.08s -> 14430.08s]  Alright. What time?
[14430.08s -> 14432.08s]  Is eight o'clock okay? Yes.
[14432.08s -> 14434.08s]  That's fine. I will meet you there.
[14434.08s -> 14436.08s]  I'm really looking forward to it.
[14436.08s -> 14438.77s]  Me too.
[14438.77s -> 14441.33s]  That was like a pretty normal
[14441.33s -> 14443.70s]  conversation. But thank you.
[14443.70s -> 14445.70s]  Thank you Sad Vega for the one Dala. Oh boy,
[14445.70s -> 14447.70s]  Resident Evil 2. Hope you do this hardcore.
[14447.70s -> 14449.70s]  You're robbing yourself for great experience if you don't
[14449.70s -> 14451.70s]  do hardcore first time through.
[14451.70s -> 14453.70s]  Uh, let me tell you hardcore
[14453.70s -> 14455.70s]  mode first time. Woo, will you be the
[14455.70s -> 14459.66s]  on the edge of your seat?
[14459.66s -> 14461.66s]  No, we're gonna do normal. I just wanna play through.
[14461.66s -> 14463.66s]  I don't wanna panic.
[14463.66s -> 14465.84s]  Thank you Alec for the one Dala.
[14465.84s -> 14467.84s]  Can't wait to see you scream at Mr. X.
[14467.84s -> 14471.04s]  I don't know what that is.
[14471.04s -> 14473.04s]  But, I'm, I'm sure
[14473.04s -> 14475.04s]  whatever, whoever that is.
[14475.04s -> 14477.47s]  Dork Cube, thanks for the one Dala. My brother and I
[14477.47s -> 14479.47s]  were watching back through your subscriber milestone
[14479.47s -> 14481.47s]  videos. And when I told him that
[14481.47s -> 14483.47s]  Burger Boy was married, he was amazed
[14483.47s -> 14485.47s]  that even the egg could find love.
[14485.47s -> 14488.66s]  Yeah.
[14488.66s -> 14490.66s]  Look at everybody. There's somebody out there for everybody guys.
[14490.66s -> 14493.28s]  Don't worry.
[14493.28s -> 14495.28s]  Uh, thank you Crusade for the four Dala's.
[14495.28s -> 14497.28s]  Thank you Divus for the two Dala's.
[14497.28s -> 14500.74s]  Thank you guys.
[14500.74s -> 14502.74s]  Uh, thank you Frick Nut
[14502.74s -> 14504.74s]  for the one Dala. Pause the game, I need to pee.
[14504.74s -> 14508.77s]  You can pee right now?
[14508.77s -> 14511.90s]  You get time to pee right now?
[14511.90s -> 14513.90s]  Flug Boy, thanks for the one Dala. So I honestly have been
[14513.90s -> 14515.90s]  trying to stay away from watching Resident Evil 2 gameplay.
[14515.90s -> 14517.90s]  But I couldn't stay away from watching yours.
[14517.90s -> 14519.90s]  I just wanna say after Resident Evil 7
[14519.90s -> 14521.90s]  this will be my first Resident Evil game.
[14521.90s -> 14523.90s]  And I wanna go back and play the other.
[14523.90s -> 14525.90s]  Do you think it's worth to buy the
[14525.90s -> 14527.90s]  previous consoles for it?
[14527.90s -> 14530.40s]  Uh, I don't think you need to.
[14530.40s -> 14533.15s]  At least
[14533.15s -> 14535.15s]  three or four of them have been ported, right?
[14535.15s -> 14537.52s]  Aren't there at least
[14537.52s -> 14539.52s]  a few of them that have been ported to the PC?
[14539.52s -> 14546.69s]  I don't think you have to go back to like
[14546.69s -> 14548.69s]  the old old consoles.
[14548.69s -> 14552.46s]  But they're great games.
[14552.46s -> 14554.46s]  Some of them are a little old and dated.
[14554.46s -> 14557.09s]  But
[14557.09s -> 14559.09s]  I think they're still all great experiences.
[14559.09s -> 14561.09s]  As long as you can stomach a lot of
[14561.09s -> 14563.09s]  kind of old school type of
[14563.09s -> 14566.22s]  gameplay.
[14566.22s -> 14568.22s]  Resident Evil 3 Remake is coming up for sure after this.
[14568.22s -> 14570.22s]  I would be surprised if they didn't
[14570.22s -> 14572.22s]  just do them all. Up until 4.
[14572.22s -> 14574.22s]  I mean they already kind of did one.
[14574.22s -> 14577.55s]  But not like this.
[14577.55s -> 14579.55s]  But thank you Flugboy for the two dollars.
[14579.55s -> 14581.55s]  Also sorry for the lack of bits. I hope you're doing well Jeremy.
[14581.55s -> 14583.55s]  Much love to you, Kim, and Italics, and the rest of the family.
[14583.55s -> 14586.82s]  Uh, don't worry about
[14586.82s -> 14588.82s]  a lack of money. You don't have to
[14588.82s -> 14590.82s]  you don't have to pay me.
[14590.82s -> 14592.82s]  Don't worry about that. Thank you for
[14592.82s -> 14594.82s]  sticking around. Thanks for watching. Thanks for the support as always.
[14594.82s -> 14597.25s]  Uh, robot mentality
[14597.25s -> 14599.25s]  thanks for the one dollar.
[14599.25s -> 14601.25s]  Andy's mountain thanks for the five dollars.
[14601.25s -> 14603.25s]  Hey Jeremy, are you still planning on releasing
[14603.25s -> 14605.25s]  shirts? Tomorrow or
[14605.25s -> 14607.25s]  Wednesday.
[14607.25s -> 14609.25s]  It'll be a storefront. It'll be there forever.
[14609.25s -> 14611.68s]  Because I can do other stuff besides shirts.
[14611.68s -> 14615.33s]  Uh, thank you Jeremiah
[14615.33s -> 14617.33s]  for the five dollars. I love you
[14617.33s -> 14619.33s]  Jerma, but your incompetence dishonored a great
[14619.33s -> 14621.33s]  game with Toy Commander.
[14621.33s -> 14624.46s]  Uh, that's alright.
[14624.46s -> 14628.50s]  Toy Commander was fun.
[14628.50s -> 14632.66s]  I don't need to watch Speedrun.
[14632.66s -> 14635.22s]  Appreciate the five dollars though. Thank you.
[14635.22s -> 14637.78s]  Uh, Anonilus thanks for the
[14637.78s -> 14639.78s]  one dollar. Anonilus, hey Jerma, it's the Animal Rescue
[14639.78s -> 14641.78s]  guy. Just wanted to say thanks for having people go to my
[14641.78s -> 14643.78s]  baby duck stream.
[14643.78s -> 14646.14s]  I truly didn't expect that.
[14646.14s -> 14648.14s]  Hoping a few people got cheered up by watching them. Thanks again.
[14648.14s -> 14650.58s]  For sure, yeah.
[14650.58s -> 14656.45s]  They're very cute ducks.
[14656.45s -> 14660.80s]  Everybody loves ducks. But thank you.
[14660.80s -> 14664.26s]  Uh, we had some big bits just coming
[14664.26s -> 14666.75s]  right now from
[14666.75s -> 14668.75s]  uh, Gornhole. Fifty dollars from Gornhole.
[14668.75s -> 14670.93s]  Thank you.
[14670.93s -> 14674.26s]  Here have some bits for the Bitcoin operated
[14674.26s -> 14676.26s]  doctor on the Vegas Strip. I hear he's
[14676.26s -> 14678.26s]  great at telling the future for 25 cents
[14678.26s -> 14680.26s]  a pop. What?
[14680.26s -> 14683.71s]  Thank you so much for the fifty dollars Gornhole
[14683.71s -> 14685.71s]  Adder. Is that even real?
[14685.71s -> 14689.30s]  That's not a real thing, is it?
[14689.30s -> 14696.27s]  Thank you so much.
[14696.27s -> 14701.07s]  And then the Olaf gave us
[14701.07s -> 14703.07s]  a million subs. Thank you so
[14703.07s -> 14705.07s]  much. That's so much.
[14705.07s -> 14707.07s]  So much, so much. I just said so much so many times.
[14707.07s -> 14709.70s]  But thank you.
[14709.70s -> 14713.41s]  Uh, Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.
[14713.41s -> 14715.41s]  Thank you again for fifteen dollars
[14715.41s -> 14717.41s]  and fifty on top of that.
[14717.41s -> 14720.16s]  Cox seems to have gotten the message
[14720.16s -> 14722.16s]  from my friend from Nevada.
[14722.16s -> 14724.16s]  Who works with them said there
[14724.16s -> 14726.16s]  was a surge a few
[14726.16s -> 14728.16s]  minutes ago when I asked him about it.
[14728.16s -> 14733.14s]  Really?
[14733.14s -> 14735.14s]  So that was, there was a surge?
[14735.14s -> 14737.31s]  So should I not have been
[14737.31s -> 14739.31s]  talking all that shit? Of course I should have.
[14739.31s -> 14742.51s]  Was there more money?
[14742.51s -> 14746.86s]  Lakronda, fifty dollars.
[14746.86s -> 14748.86s]  My goodness, thank you. Fifty more dollars.
[14748.86s -> 14753.86s]  You guys are showing me so much
[14753.86s -> 14755.86s]  love and so much support. I gotta get like
[14755.86s -> 14760.98s]  a full stream in here.
[14760.98s -> 14762.98s]  Four hours, four and a half, five hours. I usually
[14762.98s -> 14764.98s]  like to go for like six to eight.
[14764.98s -> 14767.22s]  Where's my goddamn stamina lately?
[14767.22s -> 14769.22s]  With these fucking migraine
[14769.22s -> 14771.52s]  things.
[14771.52s -> 14773.82s]  Thank you. They say, hey Jeremy, I love
[14773.82s -> 14775.82s]  donating to you. I plan on donating even more in the future.
[14775.82s -> 14777.82s]  I love the rush of being
[14777.82s -> 14779.82s]  noticed by somebody I idolize.
[14779.82s -> 14782.64s]  Well let me tell you one very
[14782.64s -> 14785.33s]  important thing. You don't
[14785.33s -> 14787.33s]  have to pay me to do that.
[14787.33s -> 14790.21s]  I hope you know that it doesn't matter if
[14790.21s -> 14792.21s]  you give me fifty dollars, a hundred dollars,
[14792.21s -> 14794.21s]  two dollars, five dollars. Thank you.
[14794.21s -> 14796.21s]  Like you're
[14796.21s -> 14798.21s]  allowing me to do this
[14798.21s -> 14801.15s]  and do it for a living.
[14801.15s -> 14803.15s]  You don't have to worry about paying me that much
[14803.15s -> 14806.16s]  money. I just hope you all know that.
[14806.16s -> 14809.94s]  There's no
[14809.94s -> 14811.94s]  requirement to have to give
[14811.94s -> 14813.94s]  me money so I'll
[14813.94s -> 14815.94s]  be thanking you. You know what I mean?
[14815.94s -> 14817.94s]  You being here by yourself
[14817.94s -> 14819.94s]  one out of
[14819.94s -> 14824.22s]  doesn't matter how many people.
[14824.22s -> 14827.36s]  I appreciate you nonetheless. But thank you
[14827.36s -> 14829.36s]  so much for even thinking about doing it in the first place.
[14829.36s -> 14832.11s]  That goes for everybody.
[14832.11s -> 14838.77s]  Back earlier after some
[14838.77s -> 14841.33s]  of these huge community subs.
[14841.33s -> 14843.33s]  But thank you Apocalyptic
[14843.33s -> 14845.33s]  Cheeseburger. Hopefully that
[14845.33s -> 14847.33s]  was just a problem.
[14847.33s -> 14849.33s]  And it's fine now because that would be
[14849.33s -> 14851.33s]  very annoying if it didn't go away, which it's been weird
[14851.33s -> 14853.33s]  the last week.
[14853.33s -> 14855.57s]  Thank you Meow for the one dollar. Have fun
[14855.57s -> 14857.57s]  getting spooked Jerma. I know
[14857.57s -> 14859.57s]  I did on my first playthrough. It's been pretty scary.
[14859.57s -> 14862.77s]  It's been pretty good.
[14862.77s -> 14865.65s]  There's been some decent scares.
[14865.65s -> 14867.65s]  Thank you Ike Turtle for the one dollar. The game's graphics
[14867.65s -> 14869.65s]  were very impressive. That sweaty zombie in the corner
[14869.65s -> 14871.65s]  looked very realistic
[14871.65s -> 14874.46s]  and frightening.
[14874.46s -> 14876.46s]  Also this. I look like Leon Kennedy.
[14876.46s -> 14880.24s]  Yeah, good.
[14880.24s -> 14882.24s]  From the Christmas stream. Yeah, he's a handsome guy.
[14882.24s -> 14885.89s]  Hey Solid Milk
[14885.89s -> 14887.89s]  thanks for the dollar. Cox controls
[14887.89s -> 14889.89s]  compact consumers crappy connection.
[14889.89s -> 14892.70s]  The six C's
[14892.70s -> 14896.29s]  is true.
[14896.29s -> 14898.29s]  Hey 99Trader thanks for the 10 bucks.
[14898.29s -> 14900.29s]  Hey Jerma, just hoping you're having a good time playing the game as we
[14900.29s -> 14902.29s]  are watching you get scared to shit.
[14902.29s -> 14904.46s]  Thank you for 10 dollars and yeah
[14904.46s -> 14906.46s]  I wish I could keep going.
[14906.46s -> 14911.84s]  But I need to know my own
[14911.84s -> 14915.49s]  limitations. And I've told you guys this
[14915.49s -> 14917.49s]  a lot of times. I don't, if I
[14917.49s -> 14919.49s]  know that I'm not going to be able to put forth something
[14919.49s -> 14922.37s]  that's, I don't
[14922.37s -> 14924.37s]  want to force myself to do something.
[14924.37s -> 14927.50s]  And if I know in my
[14927.50s -> 14929.50s]  brain and in my heart that I know that
[14929.50s -> 14931.50s]  I'm going to have to like force myself to
[14931.50s -> 14933.50s]  do this and kind of power through
[14933.50s -> 14936.13s]  an issue, I'd
[14936.13s -> 14938.13s]  I'd rather do it again. Just do it again.
[14938.13s -> 14940.13s]  We can just go again and
[14940.13s -> 14942.13s]  have fun. Not like, not like I wasn't
[14942.13s -> 14944.13s]  having any fun but I could, I could
[14944.13s -> 14946.13s]  just tell. I could feel it. And it's starting to happen now
[14946.13s -> 14949.01s]  too.
[14949.01s -> 14951.01s]  But that's just kind of a mentality I've always had.
[14951.01s -> 14953.44s]  But thank you so much for the 10 bucks.
[14953.44s -> 14955.44s]  Thank you Sosredo for the three
[14955.44s -> 14957.44s]  dollars. It's a clip. Let's see what it is.
[14957.44s -> 14959.44s]  He wasn't, no no I was having, I was having a
[14959.44s -> 14961.44s]  lot of fun. This game's fucking awesome.
[14961.44s -> 14965.15s]  It's just, why is this
[14965.15s -> 14970.51s]  black screen? Alright back to the dark room.
[14970.51s -> 14972.51s]  And the storage box, I'm going to confirm.
[14972.51s -> 14980.58s]  That's why I don't like the face cam.
[14980.58s -> 14982.75s]  Really.
[14982.75s -> 14984.75s]  Joel, thank, not Joel, thank you
[14984.75s -> 14986.75s]  iammonk for the one dollar. Joel has your
[14986.75s -> 14989.31s]  back.
[14989.31s -> 14995.39s]  Short people got
[14995.39s -> 14998.98s]  no
[14998.98s -> 15000.98s]  short people got
[15000.98s -> 15004.11s]  no short people got
[15004.11s -> 15006.11s]  no reason to
[15006.11s -> 15008.11s]  live.
[15008.11s -> 15010.48s]  We just had Jerma host us.
[15010.48s -> 15012.48s]  We're not going to have this.
[15012.48s -> 15015.04s]  He's got my back.
[15015.04s -> 15017.04s]  That's enough.
[15017.04s -> 15019.04s]  I can't
[15019.04s -> 15021.04s]  laugh that hard right now.
[15024.30s -> 15026.30s]  Joel, all I gotta say is one thing.
[15026.30s -> 15028.30s]  Just play it to the fucking gamer
[15028.30s -> 15031.38s]  challenge.
[15031.38s -> 15033.38s]  He's so bad at games.
[15033.38s -> 15035.38s]  Just while I'm going to turn it on, I'm going to destroy you
[15035.38s -> 15037.38s]  in the video gamer challenge.
[15037.38s -> 15042.29s]  What happened to
[15042.29s -> 15044.29s]  Jerma? He sounds sad. I'm not sad.
[15044.29s -> 15046.29s]  I'm perfectly fucking happy. Everything's great.
[15046.29s -> 15048.29s]  Except for I've developed
[15048.29s -> 15050.29s]  another headache here.
[15050.29s -> 15052.29s]  In the middle of the stream and I'm doing just alright.
[15052.29s -> 15056.83s]  I'm doing fine.
[15056.83s -> 15058.83s]  But thank you iammonk for the clip.
[15058.83s -> 15060.83s]  Mouse8, thanks for ten bucks. A jewel for your scepter.
[15060.83s -> 15062.83s]  Also examine the scepter with a winky face.
[15062.83s -> 15065.26s]  Thank you mouse8 for the
[15065.26s -> 15067.82s]  tips.
[15067.82s -> 15069.82s]  And the ten bucks. I'm not sad.
[15069.82s -> 15072.06s]  I'm not sad.
[15072.06s -> 15074.69s]  Oh my god another fifty dollars.
[15074.69s -> 15076.69s]  Holy shit.
[15076.69s -> 15078.69s]  Ace Mclase fifty bucks.
[15078.69s -> 15080.69s]  Head pain is the bane of my existence.
[15080.69s -> 15082.69s]  Thanks for the stream Jerma.
[15082.69s -> 15086.46s]  Jerma heart, Jerma heart.
[15086.46s -> 15088.46s]  Yeah, there's one
[15088.46s -> 15090.46s]  thing I really can't
[15090.46s -> 15092.46s]  handle. And it's
[15092.46s -> 15094.46s]  like head pain, like headache.
[15094.46s -> 15096.46s]  It makes anything I do impossible.
[15096.46s -> 15099.34s]  So those of you guys that get
[15099.34s -> 15101.34s]  cluster headaches and migraines and
[15101.34s -> 15103.34s]  headaches a couple times a week.
[15103.34s -> 15105.34s]  I completely feel your pain here.
[15105.34s -> 15107.34s]  I completely understand exactly.
[15107.34s -> 15111.76s]  It sucks.
[15111.76s -> 15113.76s]  Yeah, I know.
[15113.76s -> 15115.76s]  I don't want to play getting over it.
[15115.76s -> 15117.76s]  He's already getting practice. That's not fair.
[15117.76s -> 15121.54s]  How would that be fair at all?
[15121.54s -> 15123.54s]  I don't get the practice in getting over it.
[15123.54s -> 15125.54s]  He's streamed it like twice in a row now.
[15125.54s -> 15132.83s]  We gotta do something that we both have never done.
[15132.83s -> 15138.34s]  Two thanks or worse.
[15138.34s -> 15140.34s]  Yeah, those are really bad too.
[15140.34s -> 15142.34s]  There's a lot, but I don't know.
[15142.34s -> 15145.86s]  It's tough.
[15145.86s -> 15149.87s]  But thank you so much
[15149.87s -> 15151.87s]  to mouse8.
[15151.87s -> 15153.87s]  Thank you smelly boy for the one dollar. I shoveled snow.
[15153.87s -> 15157.01s]  Congratulations on the snow shoveling.
[15157.01s -> 15159.01s]  I haven't seen snow in a while.
[15159.01s -> 15161.01s]  Part of me misses it.
[15161.01s -> 15164.13s]  Part of me misses it.
[15164.13s -> 15166.50s]  Thank you
[15166.50s -> 15168.50s]  yelewa.
[15168.50s -> 15170.50s]  Thank you for the one dollar.
[15170.50s -> 15173.38s]  Robot mentality, thanks for the one dollar.
[15173.38s -> 15175.94s]  Slop shop, thanks for the
[15175.94s -> 15177.94s]  ten bucks. Slop shop.
[15177.94s -> 15179.94s]  Hey Jerma, been a fan of the channel for a while.
[15179.94s -> 15181.94s]  When is the live action Jerma Rumble 2 happening?
[15181.94s -> 15185.20s]  I want it to.
[15185.20s -> 15187.82s]  I don't have a set date.
[15187.82s -> 15189.82s]  I don't have a set date for really anything.
[15189.82s -> 15194.30s]  But it's definitely something I want to do.
[15194.30s -> 15196.30s]  And that would be something that I would want to be actually
[15196.30s -> 15198.30s]  live broadcasted on Twitch
[15198.30s -> 15201.06s]  as an event.
[15201.06s -> 15203.94s]  And really go all out.
[15203.94s -> 15205.94s]  Even more so than I did last time.
[15205.94s -> 15207.94s]  Definitely something I want to do.
[15207.94s -> 15211.33s]  What about the school play?
[15211.33s -> 15213.33s]  That would be a nice precursor, wouldn't it?
[15213.33s -> 15215.89s]  But Slop shop, thank you for the twenty dollars.
[15215.89s -> 15217.89s]  You gave me another ten bucks as well.
[15217.89s -> 15220.32s]  Thank you. Right after that.
[15220.32s -> 15222.75s]  Thank you so much for the twenty dollars.
[15222.75s -> 15224.75s]  Egg Johnson, thanks for the one dollar. Please stop playing.
[15224.75s -> 15226.75s]  I want to go play the game and I can't if you're streaming.
[15226.75s -> 15228.75s]  Also, would you play Fortnite
[15228.75s -> 15230.75s]  if they added you as a playable character? No.
[15230.75s -> 15234.91s]  Hey, well I stopped streaming.
[15234.91s -> 15237.28s]  So you can go play it.
[15239.28s -> 15241.28s]  Hey, you got Egg. Egg Johnson.
[15241.28s -> 15244.16s]  You got your wish. Wish granted.
[15244.16s -> 15246.98s]  But no, I wouldn't play Fortnite
[15246.98s -> 15252.22s]  if I was a playable character.
[15252.22s -> 15254.78s]  I'd be like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[15254.78s -> 15257.54s]  And then I'd say,
[15257.54s -> 15259.54s]  where's my lawyer?
[15259.54s -> 15261.84s]  Then I would just start calling and suing everybody.
[15261.84s -> 15265.62s]  You know how quickly they'd get sued?
[15265.62s -> 15272.91s]  Sue Fortnite.
[15272.91s -> 15274.91s]  Peaceful Haley, thanks for the one dollar.
[15274.91s -> 15276.91s]  Hey Jeremy, just stopped by to say hi.
[15276.91s -> 15278.91s]  And recently, I don't know, I've been so confused
[15278.91s -> 15280.91s]  on what I want to do with my life.
[15280.91s -> 15282.91s]  I mean, I know what to do, I guess,
[15282.91s -> 15284.91s]  but starting is the hardest part.
[15284.91s -> 15286.91s]  I've been streaming, which is fun.
[15286.91s -> 15288.91s]  I'm just trying to go through more creative routes in my life.
[15288.91s -> 15290.91s]  Because all I want in life is to make myself another happy.
[15290.91s -> 15292.91s]  And yeah, I don't want to ramble,
[15292.91s -> 15298.22s]  but thanks for the inspiration.
[15298.22s -> 15300.22s]  I don't want to get creative stuff
[15300.22s -> 15302.22s]  and challenging yourself creatively.
[15302.22s -> 15304.22s]  Creatively? Creatively?
[15304.22s -> 15306.22s]  What the fuck am I saying?
[15306.22s -> 15308.53s]  There's...
[15308.53s -> 15311.79s]  There really is no right answer.
[15311.79s -> 15315.70s]  If you're stuck
[15315.70s -> 15317.87s]  creatively,
[15317.87s -> 15319.87s]  or if you want to go through more creative stuff in your life,
[15319.87s -> 15321.87s]  you kind of have to make it happen.
[15321.87s -> 15327.74s]  You know?
[15327.74s -> 15330.24s]  And he said starting is the hardest part.
[15330.24s -> 15332.24s]  Starting is probably the hardest part,
[15332.24s -> 15334.24s]  but an equally difficult part is
[15334.24s -> 15336.24s]  continuing to do things that you want to do.
[15336.24s -> 15338.24s]  And not letting
[15338.24s -> 15340.24s]  roadblocks get in the way.
[15340.24s -> 15343.06s]  Because they will, it'll happen.
[15343.06s -> 15347.07s]  But you also have to remember that
[15347.07s -> 15349.07s]  you don't have to do something
[15349.07s -> 15351.07s]  just because you think you do.
[15351.07s -> 15353.25s]  You know, there's plenty of things that I
[15353.25s -> 15355.25s]  wanted to do in my life that I didn't do.
[15355.25s -> 15357.25s]  That I wanted to do.
[15357.25s -> 15359.55s]  And you just, you have to make sure
[15359.55s -> 15361.55s]  that you have a few different interests
[15361.55s -> 15363.55s]  so that when at least one of them
[15363.55s -> 15368.48s]  works out, then you're happy.
[15368.48s -> 15370.48s]  Roadblocks in the way.
[15370.48s -> 15378.80s]  But you just want to make sure that you have
[15378.80s -> 15380.80s]  like I said, we've kind of gone over it
[15380.80s -> 15382.80s]  a couple times, and that's my opinion on it is,
[15382.80s -> 15384.80s]  make sure that you have a few interests
[15384.80s -> 15387.04s]  that you would be happy with.
[15387.04s -> 15389.47s]  And pursue them.
[15389.47s -> 15391.78s]  If one sticks, great. Awesome.
[15391.78s -> 15394.27s]  If the others don't, you have
[15394.27s -> 15396.27s]  more than one interest. Right?
[15396.27s -> 15398.77s]  I'm not saying that streaming is one of those things,
[15398.77s -> 15404.08s]  but it could be anything.
[15404.08s -> 15406.08s]  Just become the number one
[15406.08s -> 15408.45s]  roadblocks streamer.
[15408.45s -> 15413.49s]  You can do that.
[15413.49s -> 15415.49s]  But I wish you the best in life,
[15415.49s -> 15417.49s]  I wish you the best luck in whatever you're doing.
[15417.49s -> 15422.74s]  Just try. As long as you try,
[15422.74s -> 15424.74s]  and as long as you have a few things that you like,
[15424.74s -> 15427.30s]  give them all a try.
[15427.30s -> 15430.30s]  You never know. But thank you for the
[15430.30s -> 15432.30s]  $1 Haley. Thank you for the $1 to
[15432.30s -> 15434.67s]  robot mentality. Thank you.
[15434.67s -> 15437.10s]  No message or anything, but
[15437.10s -> 15439.28s]  just a dollar, thank you.
[15439.28s -> 15441.28s]  Getting close to the end here, we've got King of Acorns
[15441.28s -> 15443.28s]  for $5. Hey German, my name is Austin.
[15443.28s -> 15445.28s]  I'm a long time viewer of the streams.
[15445.28s -> 15447.28s]  Thanks for all the laughs. You are awesome.
[15447.28s -> 15449.28s]  Never stop doing what you're doing. Also, can I get
[15449.28s -> 15451.28s]  a birthday shout out? Yeah.
[15451.28s -> 15453.90s]  Happy birthday, King of Acorns.
[15453.90s -> 15455.90s]  Happy 23rd birthday.
[15455.90s -> 15459.94s]  23?
[15459.94s -> 15462.24s]  And then say LOL thanks.
[15462.24s -> 15464.24s]  You're welcome. Hope you have a great one.
[15464.24s -> 15468.08s]  Thank you Smelly Boy for the $1.
[15468.08s -> 15470.58s]  Please explain
[15470.58s -> 15473.33s]  this.
[15473.33s -> 15476.72s]  Breeze frame of
[15476.72s -> 15478.72s]  I don't know what that is. Those are green eyes?
[15478.72s -> 15480.72s]  You doctored that photo.
[15480.72s -> 15484.30s]  Thank you for the $1 though.
[15484.30s -> 15488.91s]  $2 actually.
[15488.91s -> 15490.91s]  Emooch, thanks for the $1. Hey German, much love
[15490.91s -> 15493.79s]  and I'm always happy to support the channel.
[15493.79s -> 15497.70s]  I really appreciate it. Thank you.
[15497.70s -> 15500.83s]  Mail Vallo, thanks for the $4.
[15500.83s -> 15502.83s]  Hey German, recently changed my alias.
[15502.83s -> 15504.83s]  Used to be FGWGWF.
[15504.83s -> 15506.83s]  Not sure if you remember me, I do.
[15506.83s -> 15508.83s]  Figure it was time for an actual username
[15508.83s -> 15510.83s]  and not one
[15510.83s -> 15512.83s]  that I got from slapping
[15512.83s -> 15515.14s]  my keyboard. While on the
[15515.14s -> 15517.14s]  subject, I remember you talking briefly in a TF2
[15517.14s -> 15519.14s]  video like 4 years ago
[15519.14s -> 15521.14s]  how you got your alias. Cause your name
[15521.14s -> 15523.44s]  is Jeremy. Is it inspired
[15523.44s -> 15526.00s]  by anything though?
[15526.00s -> 15529.39s]  No. Just kind of
[15529.39s -> 15531.39s]  easy nickname.
[15531.39s -> 15534.46s]  I was called and
[15534.46s -> 15537.60s]  kind of just stuck. But thank you for the
[15537.60s -> 15539.60s]  $4.
[15539.60s -> 15543.06s]  Great name change. Hey Tingy,
[15543.06s -> 15545.06s]  thanks for $2. Hey, here's $2 for express
[15545.06s -> 15547.06s]  shipping on those shirts. If you
[15547.06s -> 15549.06s]  can give Teespring a call and let them know I paid
[15549.06s -> 15554.05s]  extra. That would be nice.
[15554.05s -> 15556.05s]  I'm not in control of the shipping.
[15556.05s -> 15558.54s]  That will be on Teespring.
[15558.54s -> 15560.54s]  Freudian weapon, thanks for the $3. Not sure if this was
[15560.54s -> 15562.54s]  brought up, but your headaches might be caused by straining your
[15562.54s -> 15564.54s]  eyes on the screen. Have you considered getting
[15564.54s -> 15566.54s]  your eyes checked? Feel better, man.
[15566.54s -> 15569.04s]  Ah, but first of all, thanks for the $3.
[15569.04s -> 15571.04s]  Second of all, I've had my eyes checked. I had an eye
[15571.04s -> 15573.04s]  exam last year. Everything
[15573.04s -> 15575.04s]  is good to go. It's...
[15575.04s -> 15577.04s]  I've had headaches my whole life.
[15577.04s -> 15579.22s]  I actually got
[15579.22s -> 15581.22s]  diagnosed with migraines. I had to take
[15581.22s -> 15583.22s]  Imitrex for a little while.
[15583.22s -> 15585.22s]  I had an Imitrex nasal spray.
[15585.22s -> 15587.71s]  But I didn't like taking it anymore.
[15587.71s -> 15590.34s]  I didn't like what it did.
[15590.34s -> 15592.34s]  So... last year?
[15592.34s -> 15594.34s]  Well, I mean, it's 2019. I'm talking
[15594.34s -> 15596.34s]  like 2018, probably like
[15596.34s -> 15598.34s]  four or five months ago.
[15598.34s -> 15603.33s]  But, yeah,
[15603.33s -> 15605.33s]  it's just something that happens sometimes.
[15605.33s -> 15607.33s]  And I've had...
[15607.33s -> 15609.33s]  I've had like CT scans of my head to make sure
[15609.33s -> 15613.68s]  there's nothing really going on.
[15613.68s -> 15615.68s]  But it might be worth another conversation because
[15615.68s -> 15622.59s]  it's really annoying.
[15622.59s -> 15625.02s]  Spray gets you high.
[15625.02s -> 15627.02s]  No, it just like shuts you off. It's weird.
[15627.02s -> 15631.12s]  And when I would do...
[15631.12s -> 15633.12s]  When I would get a bad migraine and I would
[15633.12s -> 15635.12s]  do Imitrex, you're supposed to do it right when the headache comes on.
[15635.12s -> 15637.12s]  Right at the onset of a real migraine,
[15637.12s -> 15639.12s]  you're supposed to do it.
[15639.12s -> 15641.12s]  But, man, it would shut me off for like four days.
[15641.12s -> 15643.12s]  I would be just
[15643.12s -> 15645.49s]  turned the fuck off.
[15645.49s -> 15647.49s]  Groggy, messed up, sloppy,
[15647.49s -> 15649.49s]  slippery. I would be for like at least
[15649.49s -> 15651.79s]  three or four days. I hated it.
[15651.79s -> 15659.02s]  But, do not
[15659.02s -> 15662.35s]  be concerned. I know that sometimes
[15662.35s -> 15664.35s]  when I talk about medical stuff, people go
[15664.35s -> 15666.35s]  oh, fuck, are you alright?
[15666.35s -> 15668.35s]  I'm just like, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Don't worry.
[15668.35s -> 15673.01s]  Don't worry about me.
[15673.01s -> 15677.36s]  Everything's gonna be just fine. But thank you,
[15677.36s -> 15679.36s]  Frodeon. Thank you, robot mentality for the one dollar.
[15679.36s -> 15681.36s]  Thank you, Kinky
[15681.36s -> 15683.36s]  Lil Poo Poo for the five
[15683.36s -> 15686.05s]  dollars. I'm gonna...
[15686.05s -> 15688.05s]  I can't laugh at that. I don't know what that is.
[15688.05s -> 15690.05s]  I don't know what that means. What the fuck did I just read?
[15690.05s -> 15692.05s]  Thank you for the five dollars. Thank you, Keldos
[15692.05s -> 15694.05s]  for the one dollar.
[15694.05s -> 15700.51s]  I swear this is not a gnome.
[15700.51s -> 15708.77s]  It's a Vinesauce animated thing.
[15708.77s -> 15712.29s]  Clip it.
[15712.29s -> 15714.29s]  That's a Vinny animated
[15714.29s -> 15717.74s]  geese. You wanna hear it again?
[15717.74s -> 15727.47s]  Alright, here's the whole video.
[15727.47s -> 15729.47s]  The video's like two minutes long.
[15729.47s -> 15732.35s]  I'm just kidding. But thank you for the video.
[15732.35s -> 15735.94s]  Thank you, Kinky
[15735.94s -> 15737.94s]  for the one dollar. I forgot to send a link
[15737.94s -> 15739.94s]  but I clipped the video of you killing a dog
[15739.94s -> 15741.94s]  and uploading it. What?
[15741.94s -> 15744.11s]  Oh, talking about in the game.
[15744.11s -> 15751.65s]  What the fuck?
[15751.65s -> 15753.65s]  This is like
[15753.65s -> 15755.65s]  a broken link. I can't even click this.
[15755.65s -> 15757.89s]  There's like five
[15757.89s -> 15768.26s]  spaces in here.
[15768.26s -> 15770.26s]  Why did you type W space W?
[15770.26s -> 15772.26s]  Why did you do all the spaces?
[15772.26s -> 15782.94s]  W space
[15782.94s -> 15786.59s]  W.
[15786.59s -> 15788.59s]  So what is this?
[15788.59s -> 15790.59s]  What the hell did you just give me as a link here?
[15790.59s -> 15793.98s]  You put a space between you
[15793.98s -> 15799.94s]  and two. You guys wanna know
[15799.94s -> 15801.94s]  what it was? What do you think it was?
[15801.94s -> 15803.94s]  Yeah.
[15803.94s -> 15809.25s]  Yeah.
[15809.25s -> 15811.25s]  That's like next level.
[15811.25s -> 15813.87s]  Alright, thank you for the dollar.
[15813.87s -> 15815.87s]  Thank you, Dr. Zoot Suit for the one dollar.
[15815.87s -> 15817.87s]  Jeremiah, I finished drawing female you.
[15817.87s -> 15821.58s]  I have sinned.
[15821.58s -> 15823.58s]  Thank you for the one dollar. Thank you, Lord Muffins for the one dollar.
[15823.58s -> 15825.58s]  Hey Jeremiah, I've been a fan for 25 years.
[15825.58s -> 15827.58s]  I would love it if you
[15827.58s -> 15832.51s]  would light by...
[15832.51s -> 15834.51s]  I'm not doing either of those things. Thank you for the one dollar,
[15834.51s -> 15836.88s]  Lord Muffin. Wizard Ribbit,
[15836.88s -> 15838.88s]  thanks for the one dollar. I need to wear Gunner Optics
[15838.88s -> 15840.88s]  to avoid gamer headache.
[15840.88s -> 15845.23s]  No, that's not what it is.
[15845.23s -> 15847.23s]  Thank you, though. Thank you, Jess, for the one dollar.
[15847.23s -> 15849.23s]  I've been keeping a library of all the sounds you've made
[15849.23s -> 15851.23s]  since the start of the year.
[15851.23s -> 15853.23s]  I was gonna keep it all...
[15853.23s -> 15855.23s]  I was gonna keep it up all year, but it's actually way more than
[15855.23s -> 15857.23s]  I thought. I have 270 sounds.
[15857.23s -> 15862.99s]  That's too many sounds.
[15862.99s -> 15865.74s]  That's more sounds than are in
[15865.74s -> 15869.65s]  the Star Wars trilogy.
[15869.65s -> 15878.29s]  Dermatantrum, what is this?
[15878.29s -> 15883.07s]  Eugh! Eugh! Eugh!
[15883.07s -> 15885.70s]  Eugh! Eugh!
[15885.70s -> 15887.70s]  That was pretty fucking close. I haven't heard that
[15887.70s -> 15889.70s]  since the stream. That was really close. That was really
[15889.70s -> 15893.02s]  good. That was on the spot.
[15893.02s -> 15895.02s]  No practice.
[15895.02s -> 15903.71s]  But thank you, though, Jess. Thank you
[15903.71s -> 15905.71s]  something or other for the one dollar. EuroGerms,
[15905.71s -> 15907.71s]  I apologize. This one hasn't come up before.
[15907.71s -> 15909.71s]  Would you ever consider doing a Germa Rumble with
[15909.71s -> 15911.71s]  community submitted characters and bios?
[15911.71s -> 15913.71s]  Seems like a train wreck.
[15913.71s -> 15916.08s]  Um...
[15916.08s -> 15921.07s]  Probably not. Probably not like a community
[15921.07s -> 15923.07s]  rumble. Because that...
[15923.07s -> 15926.02s]  I think that would get a little messy.
[15926.02s -> 15928.02s]  Great Canadian FK Club, thanks for five more
[15928.02s -> 15933.39s]  community subs. On top of the
[15933.39s -> 15935.39s]  countless amount that you currently
[15935.39s -> 15937.39s]  have, thank you so much.
[15937.39s -> 15939.39s]  But a community rumble
[15939.39s -> 15941.39s]  would get messy for the same reasons
[15941.39s -> 15943.39s]  that I think a lot of stuff like that has a tendency to get
[15943.39s -> 15945.76s]  messy. Because
[15945.76s -> 15947.76s]  let's say that there was, you know, ten contestants
[15947.76s -> 15949.76s]  or like five, twenty contestants or something that
[15949.76s -> 15953.09s]  I would be accepting.
[15953.09s -> 15955.09s]  You know, not picking somebody's
[15955.09s -> 15957.09s]  if there's like hundreds of entries.
[15957.09s -> 15959.09s]  I don't
[15959.09s -> 15961.09s]  want to make it like a competition.
[15961.09s -> 15964.35s]  The emote contest was the last real
[15964.35s -> 15966.35s]  competition in quotes.
[15966.35s -> 15969.04s]  And it was
[15969.04s -> 15972.43s]  handled pretty well.
[15972.43s -> 15974.43s]  But I don't want to like make a whole
[15974.43s -> 15981.92s]  lot of competitions. Mod
[15981.92s -> 15987.36s]  Rumble. But it's an interesting
[15987.36s -> 15990.18s]  idea. But I don't want to have a
[15990.18s -> 15992.18s]  situation where it's like, you
[15992.18s -> 15994.18s]  picked this and not mine? What the fuck?
[15994.18s -> 15996.18s]  That one sucks! And then people get angry
[15996.18s -> 15998.18s]  and you're like, well, uh...
[15998.18s -> 16001.63s]  Stuff like that is hard to make
[16001.63s -> 16010.21s]  everybody happy. And I've learned a lot
[16010.21s -> 16012.21s]  over the years.
[16012.21s -> 16014.21s]  Trying to get them to do it, trying to get it to happen
[16014.21s -> 16016.21s]  the right way. And how would I want to do
[16016.21s -> 16018.21s]  stuff like that? I've done it a couple times.
[16018.21s -> 16023.97s]  But I do like the idea.
[16023.97s -> 16026.78s]  Just the execution would need to be done correctly.
[16026.78s -> 16029.09s]  But thank you.
[16029.09s -> 16032.29s]  Thank you to
[16032.29s -> 16034.29s]  Guido for the one dollar.
[16034.29s -> 16036.46s]  I used to get those headaches a bunch too. Went away
[16036.46s -> 16038.46s]  after I got these glasses that help the
[16038.46s -> 16040.46s]  eye strain. Maybe you should try
[16040.46s -> 16042.90s]  it. I mean, it's worth a shot.
[16042.90s -> 16044.90s]  I think a long time
[16044.90s -> 16046.90s]  ago when I was doing YouTube and sitting
[16046.90s -> 16048.90s]  in front of a screen for a long time,
[16048.90s -> 16050.90s]  it did help to wear, like,
[16050.90s -> 16052.90s]  to have, like, flux on or have,
[16052.90s -> 16054.90s]  like, optics on.
[16054.90s -> 16056.90s]  Maybe I'll go back to doing it again.
[16056.90s -> 16062.59s]  But I do appreciate it. Thank you.
[16062.59s -> 16064.59s]  Flying Sombrero, thanks for the one dollar.
[16064.59s -> 16066.59s]  Hey Jerma, I was talking with this girl I recently met
[16066.59s -> 16068.59s]  about our favorite YouTubers and streamers.
[16068.59s -> 16070.59s]  I mentioned that you were my favorite streamer and she
[16070.59s -> 16073.22s]  stopped talking to me. Thanks.
[16073.22s -> 16075.22s]  Well, good. Because that
[16075.22s -> 16077.22s]  wasn't a keeper.
[16077.22s -> 16089.87s]  You know what I'm saying? Thank you
[16089.87s -> 16093.20s]  for the one dollar. Thank you, Mom
[16093.20s -> 16095.20s]  the Peach for the one dollar. Sub
[16095.20s -> 16097.20s]  today and looking forward to the future. Hope your head feels better.
[16097.20s -> 16099.20s]  Thank you. Appreciate that.
[16099.20s -> 16102.14s]  I'm gonna take some Advil and just
[16102.14s -> 16104.14s]  relax. And we're gonna try again tomorrow.
[16104.14s -> 16107.79s]  Krusty Earwax, thanks for the one dollar.
[16107.79s -> 16109.79s]  I don't know if referencing Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
[16109.79s -> 16111.79s]  is still a joke, but you should play
[16111.79s -> 16113.79s]  one of the shitty Jojo games and then they
[16113.79s -> 16115.79s]  do like the, I don't know, but whatever.
[16115.79s -> 16121.23s]  There was one on Dreamcast that I
[16121.23s -> 16123.23s]  hovered over the purchase button and realized that it got
[16123.23s -> 16125.23s]  afforded. I'm not kidding.
[16125.23s -> 16127.98s]  Didn't buy it though.
[16127.98s -> 16129.98s]  Thank you, Awesome Stevie for the one dollar.
[16129.98s -> 16131.98s]  Okay, you are epic.
[16131.98s -> 16135.42s]  Thank you. Dr. Clay,
[16135.42s -> 16137.42s]  thanks for the one dollar. We talked about Joel
[16137.42s -> 16139.42s]  challenging me. I already accepted the challenge.
[16141.42s -> 16143.42s]  InvaderZ, thanks for the two bucks.
[16143.42s -> 16145.42s]  I was finally able to make a stream. Thank you
[16145.42s -> 16147.42s]  so much, Jerma. You're awesome and you always make me laugh.
[16147.42s -> 16150.56s]  Welcome to the stream.
[16150.56s -> 16152.56s]  Glad you made it. Sorry, it was a short one.
[16152.56s -> 16155.50s]  Thank you, Breenland for the one dollar.
[16155.50s -> 16157.50s]  Hey yo, are you gonna play Kingdom Hearts 1, 2, and 3?
[16159.68s -> 16161.68s]  I'd say all of them, but it'd never
[16161.68s -> 16164.50s]  finish.
[16164.50s -> 16166.50s]  No, that's like 6,000 hours.
[16166.50s -> 16169.50s]  I don't think I'm gonna play Kingdom Hearts 3
[16169.50s -> 16171.81s]  on stream or 1 or 2.
[16171.81s -> 16173.81s]  But I hope you enjoy it when it releases in
[16175.81s -> 16177.81s]  like less than 24 hours.
[16177.81s -> 16179.81s]  So, have a great playthrough of Kingdom Hearts 3.
[16179.81s -> 16185.95s]  I heard it's pretty good.
[16185.95s -> 16189.41s]  Thank you for the suggestion,
[16189.41s -> 16191.41s]  but probably not on this channel.
[16191.41s -> 16193.90s]  Hey Tingy, thanks for the two bucks. I see how this is
[16193.90s -> 16195.90s]  gonna happen. Sliding more bits under the table.
[16195.90s -> 16198.46s]  Will this do, Wink? You can't pay me to do
[16198.46s -> 16202.88s]  anything. Thank you, DoubleD for the one
[16202.88s -> 16204.88s]  dollar. Hey Jerma, could you please assist me in identifying
[16204.88s -> 16206.88s]  this man? He's been
[16206.88s -> 16208.88s]  tormenting me for months. He keeps
[16208.88s -> 16210.88s]  rambling on something about playing Army of Two with his
[16210.88s -> 16212.88s]  college. It's a picture of italics.
[16212.88s -> 16216.34s]  Thank you. Subwab,
[16216.34s -> 16218.34s]  thank you for the ten dollars.
[16218.34s -> 16221.34s]  Jerma, figuring out the
[16221.34s -> 16223.34s]  person I want to be in life has been difficult, but I want to let you
[16223.34s -> 16225.34s]  know you've been a huge inspiration.
[16225.34s -> 16227.34s]  You're a real hero to me, so thanks for all the good times.
[16227.34s -> 16230.29s]  If I can inspire somebody
[16230.29s -> 16232.85s]  to do anything positive,
[16232.85s -> 16235.02s]  then I'm
[16235.02s -> 16237.02s]  fucking honored. Thank you.
[16237.02s -> 16239.65s]  Thank you for even saying
[16239.65s -> 16241.65s]  that. I hope
[16241.65s -> 16243.65s]  you, whatever you take from
[16243.65s -> 16245.65s]  me, whatever that is,
[16245.65s -> 16248.02s]  hope you have it positively affect your
[16248.02s -> 16250.02s]  life. Seriously, thank you.
[16250.02s -> 16252.58s]  And thank you for the ten dollars.
[16252.58s -> 16255.71s]  Thank you Dr. Plato
[16255.71s -> 16257.71s]  for the one dollar. Don't know if you're
[16257.71s -> 16259.71s]  going to see this, but I've had constant headaches and migraines
[16259.71s -> 16261.71s]  recently. Currently in the Navy,
[16261.71s -> 16263.71s]  so it's straining. I get where you're
[16263.71s -> 16265.71s]  coming from and getting headaches every day is so hard to deal
[16265.71s -> 16267.71s]  with. I've gotten an MRI, but came back clean.
[16267.71s -> 16269.71s]  I honestly don't know what to do about it.
[16269.71s -> 16272.51s]  Yeah, for me,
[16272.51s -> 16274.51s]  they come in like strings.
[16274.51s -> 16277.90s]  Like I will go to bed with a headache, wake up
[16277.90s -> 16279.90s]  groggy and fucked up and feel like
[16279.90s -> 16281.90s]  slow and headache-y.
[16281.90s -> 16283.90s]  And then another day, like it's
[16283.90s -> 16285.90s]  like an eye pain headache, and then
[16285.90s -> 16287.90s]  like a back of the head headache, and then it's gone for
[16287.90s -> 16289.90s]  three months. It's weird.
[16289.90s -> 16292.46s]  I feel like I'm currently like in the
[16292.46s -> 16296.62s]  thick of that right now.
[16296.62s -> 16298.62s]  But I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles
[16298.62s -> 16300.62s]  there. Hopefully you can
[16300.62s -> 16302.62s]  figure out some kind of solution.
[16302.62s -> 16304.62s]  Because it sucks. It does. It's annoying.
[16304.62s -> 16310.37s]  I wish you the best. Thank you for the
[16310.37s -> 16312.54s]  one dollar. Only a few more
[16312.54s -> 16314.54s]  here. Thank you Solid Milk for the one dollar. Hey Jeremy,
[16314.54s -> 16316.54s]  I'm wondering, should I ask a girl I've been friend-
[16316.54s -> 16318.54s]  Should I try to ask a girl I've been friends with
[16318.54s -> 16320.54s]  out for a while? Wait, hold on.
[16320.54s -> 16322.54s]  Hold on, let me read this again.
[16322.54s -> 16324.54s]  I've been wondering if I should try to ask a girl I've
[16324.54s -> 16326.54s]  been friends with for a while.
[16326.54s -> 16328.54s]  But I don't want to ruin our friendship.
[16328.54s -> 16330.54s]  Oh, okay. So you ask a girl out
[16330.54s -> 16333.55s]  that you've been friends with for a while.
[16333.55s -> 16336.24s]  I don't know. I
[16336.24s -> 16338.61s]  can't give you an answer there. Because I have
[16338.61s -> 16340.61s]  no idea what your relationship is like.
[16340.61s -> 16342.61s]  I don't know how long you've known
[16342.61s -> 16344.61s]  this person. It's very different. Plus I'm terrible
[16344.61s -> 16346.61s]  with relationship advice.
[16346.61s -> 16348.61s]  I'm probably one of the- I'm definitely not somebody
[16348.61s -> 16350.61s]  good to ask stuff like
[16350.61s -> 16355.41s]  this. Don't- remember
[16355.41s -> 16357.41s]  to make sure not to tell her that you know me. That you like
[16357.41s -> 16359.41s]  not know me, but that you watch me.
[16359.41s -> 16362.16s]  You saw how well that goes.
[16362.16s -> 16368.11s]  But without being able to gauge kind of
[16368.11s -> 16370.11s]  the whole situation, it'd be really easy for
[16370.11s -> 16372.11s]  me to be like, yeah, go for it.
[16372.11s -> 16374.35s]  But I have no idea.
[16374.35s -> 16376.35s]  And I don't want to be the person that gives you the wrong
[16376.35s -> 16378.35s]  info. And then it's like,
[16378.35s -> 16380.35s]  why the fuck did Jerma tell me to do that?
[16380.35s -> 16383.55s]  So I'm not really that great with
[16383.55s -> 16386.50s]  relationship advice.
[16386.50s -> 16390.02s]  I do wish you luck
[16390.02s -> 16392.45s]  in your
[16392.45s -> 16396.99s]  romantic endeavors.
[16396.99s -> 16398.99s]  But remember, if somebody wants to just be friends,
[16398.99s -> 16400.99s]  if you figure that out,
[16400.99s -> 16404.24s]  and that's, you know, you-
[16404.24s -> 16406.24s]  I know people that have-
[16406.24s -> 16408.24s]  you gotta be careful because there- I've known
[16408.24s -> 16410.24s]  people before where they were friends for a long
[16410.24s -> 16412.24s]  time, and then somebody tried to
[16412.24s -> 16414.24s]  put the, you know, the line out there.
[16414.24s -> 16416.24s]  They're like, hey, let's-
[16416.24s -> 16418.24s]  maybe we could be more than just friends. And then it
[16418.24s -> 16420.24s]  makes it awkward and they-
[16420.24s -> 16422.24s]  you go apart. So
[16422.24s -> 16424.24s]  that's possible. I mean, it depends on what your friendship
[16424.24s -> 16426.24s]  is like, but you just have to be careful.
[16426.24s -> 16434.43s]  My Tinder
[16434.43s -> 16436.43s]  pick-up line is, hey, baby, you watch
[16436.43s -> 16438.43s]  Jerma985. He beat Demon
[16438.43s -> 16440.43s]  Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 3.
[16440.43s -> 16448.05s]  No, but I- I wish
[16448.05s -> 16450.05s]  I could give you better advice, but there are much
[16450.05s -> 16452.05s]  better resources than me.
[16452.05s -> 16454.86s]  But thank you, though. Good luck.
[16454.86s -> 16457.36s]  Thank you, UpQuark, for the one dollar.
[16457.36s -> 16459.36s]  Uh, sorry for a downer.
[16459.36s -> 16461.36s]  I wanted to share with you a picture of my dog and I. She recently
[16461.36s -> 16463.36s]  passed away and couldn't miss her more.
[16463.36s -> 16465.36s]  Please, everyone, pet
[16465.36s -> 16467.36s]  your pet whenever you can.
[16467.36s -> 16474.83s]  I'm really sorry to hear that.
[16474.83s -> 16476.83s]  It's really fucking impossible to
[16476.83s -> 16479.20s]  lose an animal.
[16479.20s -> 16483.62s]  I think you've got a picture here of
[16485.62s -> 16487.86s]  this is a photo of the dog.
[16487.86s -> 16500.62s]  Let's take a look.
[16500.62s -> 16502.80s]  Is it a Golden Retriever?
[16502.80s -> 16513.15s]  No, she's beautiful.
[16513.15s -> 16515.15s]  I'm really sorry to hear about that.
[16515.15s -> 16517.65s]  Bad as she was.
[16523.52s -> 16528.00s]  I'm really sorry to hear that.
[16528.00s -> 16530.75s]  Take care of yourself. Much love to you.
[16530.75s -> 16532.75s]  And, uh, I don't know what
[16532.75s -> 16534.75s]  your dog's name was, but
[16534.75s -> 16540.26s]  rest in peace, for sure.
[16540.26s -> 16543.71s]  Thank you for the one dollar, UpQuark.
[16543.71s -> 16545.71s]  Also, thank you to Chubby Funster for the one dollar.
[16545.71s -> 16548.08s]  Hey, Jerma, you're really cute and funny.
[16548.08s -> 16550.08s]  How come you don't grow out your beard?
[16550.08s -> 16552.08s]  You'd look really good with one, I think,
[16552.08s -> 16554.08s]  unless you got something against beards, which I don't think I could
[16554.08s -> 16556.08s]  support a beard-hating streamer if that were the case.
[16556.08s -> 16558.77s]  Love you lots.
[16558.77s -> 16560.77s]  Uh, no, my facial
[16560.77s -> 16562.77s]  hair doesn't grow out full.
[16562.77s -> 16564.77s]  It's bad. It looks like shit.
[16564.77s -> 16566.77s]  It's very patchy and scraggly.
[16566.77s -> 16568.77s]  It's not full, it looks bad.
[16568.77s -> 16570.77s]  That's why I never do it.
[16570.77s -> 16572.77s]  But thank you.
[16572.77s -> 16574.77s]  Thank you, Nebula Brand, for the fifteen dollars.
[16574.77s -> 16576.77s]  Fifteen.
[16576.77s -> 16579.65s]  Thank you.
[16579.65s -> 16581.65s]  Hey, Jerma, I just want to say that even though we've never met,
[16581.65s -> 16583.65s]  watching your streams always feels like hanging out with an old friend.
[16583.65s -> 16585.65s]  2018 was a hard year for me
[16585.65s -> 16587.65s]  for a lot of reasons.
[16587.65s -> 16589.65s]  But even when I only had twenty bucks in my bank account,
[16589.65s -> 16591.65s]  I couldn't unsub from you.
[16591.65s -> 16593.65s]  I don't know how I would have gotten through the second half of 2018
[16593.65s -> 16595.65s]  if I didn't have your streams to come home to
[16595.65s -> 16597.65s]  every other day.
[16597.65s -> 16599.65s]  Thank you for bringing so much laughter to my life.
[16599.65s -> 16601.65s]  And here's to a much happier 2019.
[16601.65s -> 16603.65s]  Hell yeah.
[16603.65s -> 16606.02s]  Here's to 2019.
[16606.02s -> 16609.79s]  Thank you so much, Nebula Brand.
[16609.79s -> 16613.31s]  I'm really sorry to hear about your
[16613.31s -> 16619.71s]  struggles. Much love to you.
[16619.71s -> 16622.34s]  Thank you for everything.
[16622.34s -> 16624.64s]  Thanks for sticking around. I hope you have
[16624.64s -> 16626.64s]  a solid 2019.
[16626.64s -> 16633.15s]  Thank you.
[16633.15s -> 16635.15s]  Thank you, Wizard Ribbit, for the two bucks.
[16635.15s -> 16637.15s]  Drink some brain fluid for a healthy
[16637.15s -> 16639.58s]  brain.
[16639.58s -> 16643.74s]  It probably gives you headaches.
[16643.74s -> 16645.74s]  Tinging thanks for the two bucks. Man, you're one tough customer.
[16645.74s -> 16647.74s]  Wait, I'm the customer.
[16647.74s -> 16649.74s]  What the hell's going on here? Fine, I'll just have them...
[16649.74s -> 16651.74s]  I'll just have to get them the good, old-fashioned
[16651.74s -> 16653.74s]  American way?
[16653.74s -> 16657.38s]  No.
[16657.38s -> 16659.38s]  Thank you, Dr. Zoot Suit for the one dollar.
[16659.38s -> 16661.94s]  I realize I didn't have the link.
[16661.94s -> 16665.78s]  What is this? The link of what?
[16665.78s -> 16672.05s]  Oh, oh, okay.
[16672.05s -> 16674.05s]  Alright, oh.
[16674.05s -> 16676.42s]  Right. Oh.
[16676.42s -> 16678.66s]  Well, alright.
[16678.66s -> 16682.75s]  There it is. Thank you, Dr. Zoot Suit
[16682.75s -> 16684.75s]  for the one dollar. You mean machine for the two bucks.
[16684.75s -> 16686.75s]  Solid Milk, one dollar.
[16686.75s -> 16689.12s]  I fucked up the grammar, but thanks.
[16689.12s -> 16691.12s]  I'll be sure to tell her I watched you.
[16691.12s -> 16695.39s]  Oh god.
[16695.39s -> 16697.39s]  Thank you for the one dollar, Solid Milk.
[16697.39s -> 16699.39s]  Good luck.
[16699.39s -> 16701.76s]  Thank you to...
[16701.76s -> 16703.76s]  Thank you, Django, for the five dollars.
[16703.76s -> 16705.76s]  You're a good guy, Jerma. Thanks for all the
[16705.76s -> 16707.76s]  streams. Have a good night. You as well.
[16707.76s -> 16709.76s]  Thank you so much for the five dollars.
[16709.76s -> 16712.75s]  Appreciate the kind words.
[16712.75s -> 16714.75s]  Double D, thanks for the one dollar. Please share this photo
[16714.75s -> 16716.75s]  with the stream and anyone who sees this must have to report
[16716.75s -> 16718.75s]  it's just...
[16718.75s -> 16721.38s]  It's Italics again.
[16721.38s -> 16724.45s]  What are you doing?
[16724.45s -> 16726.45s]  He's 1200 Jerma bucks
[16726.45s -> 16728.45s]  for the... Italics was last seen on the Vegas
[16728.45s -> 16730.45s]  strip with an extremely short streamer. That's
[16730.45s -> 16732.45s]  very, very... That's not probably more than me.
[16732.45s -> 16734.45s]  But there are plenty of other streamers
[16734.45s -> 16736.45s]  that this could be who are small.
[16736.45s -> 16738.45s]  Not me, though. I'm average small.
[16738.45s -> 16740.45s]  I'm small, but I'm small. I'm average.
[16740.45s -> 16742.45s]  Alright, I'm gonna get out of here. Thank you
[16742.45s -> 16744.45s]  Anonilus for the one dollar. Hey, I meant to say thanks
[16744.45s -> 16746.45s]  in the last... I meant to say this in the last donation.
[16746.45s -> 16748.45s]  Uh, come up with a dumb
[16748.45s -> 16750.45s]  name for my
[16750.45s -> 16752.45s]  black duckling.
[16752.45s -> 16754.62s]  Italics named one
[16754.62s -> 16756.62s]  Bloor Boolean, so make it something dumb.
[16756.62s -> 16759.57s]  Enjoy these bits.
[16759.57s -> 16766.66s]  Um, how about, uh...
[16766.66s -> 16768.66s]  How about something like...
[16768.66s -> 16773.38s]  Uh...
[16773.38s -> 16778.75s]  Like a duck.
[16778.75s -> 16794.14s]  Uh, um... Bilbo.
[16794.14s -> 16797.41s]  With two L's.
[16797.41s -> 16799.41s]  I'm sorry, but that's what you're gonna get tonight.
[16799.41s -> 16805.02s]  No, don't boo me.
[16805.02s -> 16807.02s]  No, don't boo me.
[16807.02s -> 16809.26s]  But thank you for the one dollar, and
[16809.26s -> 16811.26s]  I look forward to the duck streams.
[16811.26s -> 16813.26s]  Thank you Tingy for the one dollar. Spent all the bits I had on one joke.
[16813.26s -> 16815.26s]  This is the last of them.
[16815.26s -> 16817.26s]  I'll need to buy more before tomorrow's stream. Don't worry about that.
[16817.26s -> 16823.02s]  But thank you
[16823.02s -> 16825.02s]  for the one dollar, Tingy.
[16825.02s -> 16827.02s]  And finally, quarter dime for the one dollar. Hey, Jerma, I know this might sound
[16827.02s -> 16829.02s]  weird, but I actually enjoy the
[16829.02s -> 16831.02s]  spam memes.
[16831.02s -> 16833.26s]  Can we just get a good five minutes
[16833.26s -> 16835.26s]  out of them before they get shut down?
[16835.26s -> 16838.14s]  What do you mean shut down?
[16838.14s -> 16840.77s]  Shut down?
[16840.77s -> 16843.97s]  No, there's no spam.
[16843.97s -> 16845.97s]  I'm not gonna encourage spam on this channel.
[16845.97s -> 16847.97s]  This is a PogChamp moment when I'm gonna say that on stream.
[16847.97s -> 16851.23s]  But here are the subs
[16851.23s -> 16853.23s]  and the resubs for tonight.
[16853.23s -> 16856.18s]  A ton of community subs, a ton of money.
[16856.18s -> 16858.42s]  I, again, just want to apologize
[16858.42s -> 16860.42s]  for another, like, five hour stream
[16860.42s -> 16862.42s]  or four hour
[16862.42s -> 16864.42s]  and then, you know, this part.
[16864.42s -> 16866.42s]  We'll come back. We'll try it again tomorrow.
[16866.42s -> 16868.42s]  Strong. If you're just joining us
[16868.42s -> 16870.42s]  I just got another one of those fucking
[16870.42s -> 16872.42s]  weird, like, tired headache
[16872.42s -> 16874.42s]  things. Last time
[16874.42s -> 16876.42s]  it just, I got, like, just sleepy.
[16876.42s -> 16878.85s]  But I'm actually feeling some,
[16878.85s -> 16880.85s]  like, pain and pressure here. So.
[16880.85s -> 16883.60s]  Annoying, but I have to deal with it.
[16883.60s -> 16885.60s]  I'm sorry. It's just the way it is.
[16885.60s -> 16889.17s]  See you guys tomorrow. Same
[16889.17s -> 16891.17s]  time. Much love to you.
[16891.17s -> 16894.18s]  Thank you.
[16894.18s -> 16896.74s]  Thank you. Double D just came in with another one dollar.
[16896.74s -> 16898.74s]  Goodnight gamers and goodnight Jerma.
[16898.74s -> 16900.74s]  Smiley face. And then they actually put a smiley face.
[16900.74s -> 16907.78s]  See you tomorrow.
[16907.78s -> 16916.80s]  Smiley face.
[16916.80s -> 16920.77s]  Yeah, there was, there was a
[16920.77s -> 16922.77s]  let me see how many community subs came in from earlier.
[16922.77s -> 16924.77s]  Somebody, there was, like, what, like 50
[16924.77s -> 16926.77s]  or something. For tonight.
[16926.77s -> 16930.22s]  Yeah.
[16930.22s -> 16933.49s]  The Olaf just
[16933.49s -> 16935.49s]  dropped an absolute missile.
[16935.49s -> 16937.49s]  So did Furt.
[16937.49s -> 16940.43s]  Great Canadian.
[16940.43s -> 16943.81s]  You guys are
[16943.81s -> 16945.81s]  significant. You have a significant
[16945.81s -> 16947.81s]  amount of subs come from a lot of
[16947.81s -> 16950.50s]  a lot of people that are here now. So thank you
[16950.50s -> 16953.18s]  guys. Dorkcube, thanks for the
[16953.18s -> 16955.18s]  one dollar DVD commentary for streams
[16955.18s -> 16958.45s]  joke. When?
[16958.45s -> 16960.45s]  You mean, like, re-stream a stream and then do
[16960.45s -> 16962.45s]  DVD commentary?
[16962.45s -> 16967.18s]  How many emotes slots do we have now?
[16967.18s -> 16969.18s]  It's probably so many.
[16969.18s -> 16973.14s]  Let me see.
[16973.14s -> 16975.14s]  At least another 10.
[16975.14s -> 16977.14s]  I already had, like, I had still had like five
[16977.14s -> 16979.14s]  or six that were still open.
[16979.14s -> 16981.14s]  Gonna have to come up with some more emotes.
[16981.14s -> 16989.39s]  See a doctor for the headaches?
[16989.39s -> 16993.74s]  I have, don't worry, I have seen a doctor.
[16993.74s -> 16996.18s]  I have. I actually was
[16996.18s -> 16998.18s]  I've been getting all kinds of checkups
[16998.18s -> 17000.18s]  and tests over the last three or four weeks.
[17000.18s -> 17003.25s]  So I'm in the process,
[17003.25s -> 17010.80s]  don't worry. Let's see the Bitcoin
[17010.80s -> 17012.80s]  doctor.
[17012.80s -> 17019.52s]  I don't think that's real.
[17019.52s -> 17022.91s]  If it is, that's pretty ridiculous.
[17022.91s -> 17028.66s]  But, take care
[17028.66s -> 17030.66s]  guys. I'm gonna go relax.
[17030.66s -> 17032.66s]  And we'll go again tomorrow.
[17032.66s -> 17034.66s]  Hopefully I can finish Resident
[17034.66s -> 17036.90s]  Evil 2 tomorrow. See you guys
[17036.90s -> 17038.90s]  very soon. Take care.
[17038.90s -> 17040.90s]  Much love. See you soon. Have a great night.
[17040.90s -> 17043.46s]  Goodbye.
