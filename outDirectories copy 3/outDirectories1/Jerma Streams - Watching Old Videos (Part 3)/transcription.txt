[1.02s -> 8.34s]  Good morning, or good afternoon, if you're from the European prob.
[16.98s -> 23.78s]  My name is Jeremy. I'll be joining you here for a few hours, at least probably three, four hours or so before my doctor's appointment today.
[24.86s -> 26.74s]  That's why I am live.
[27.94s -> 36.07s]  So early. I have doctor's appointment. This is the follow up to my colonoscopy. So I have to go to it.
[37.27s -> 46.29s]  Can't just not go. So I figured that we would watch some old YouTube videos. Remember, we were talking about that last week.
[51.14s -> 61.31s]  Epic? What's epic? Old tuber? Yeah, we're gonna dig into the old VHS file here.
[65.97s -> 82.82s]  I'm at work. Well, just, you can't, you can't be productive. Look, just, okay, here's my, I don't know where you work. But let's say you work at
[84.98s -> 93.14s]  retail or something. If you work at a retail shop, or you work at like a department store, this is something you should never do. This is part of a funny character joke.
[94.10s -> 100.94s]  But what you should do is just put me through the PA system in the store. So then you don't have to worry about missing something.
[111.43s -> 121.87s]  Can you imagine the customers in like a department store just walking around and they'll just hear this? They would think somebody at the store was doing this.
[123.33s -> 137.66s]  Yeah, I'm really trying to get my podcast career going. All right, dude. But anyways, I'm going to show you, I'm going to show you me real soon here.
[138.76s -> 146.76s]  You're going to get to see, you're going to get to see my face. Oh, I've got another thing to tell you too, but I'm going to wait till there's enough people in here before I talk about that one.
[147.60s -> 168.05s]  I've got a, this is an update stream. Yeah, I'm going to do a face reveal. It's been long enough. I better be in a Spider-Man costume, right? No.
[175.22s -> 195.10s]  Your hair? What about my hair? You know, somebody asked me, what, what is with you and having like the slicked back hair for E3?
[196.84s -> 202.66s]  Well, it's nothing to do with E3. That's a joke. This is a stream before noon.
[205.73s -> 214.41s]  Because I got, that's like, that's like I showered today hair. So anything you see my hair like this, it means that there was very, very recently there was a shower.
[216.54s -> 227.13s]  It's not, this is just water. It's not grease. Your hair's really greasy today.
[229.82s -> 243.38s]  This shows my real hairline though. Now you, nobody can tell me that, that I don't. Look at, look at that. Oh, no, we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. That was just like, there was like a McDonald's M right here.
[246.03s -> 255.38s]  I'm 34 years old. All right. I look, I look pretty good for 34. Anyways, let's get that off. I don't know, get me out of here.
[259.90s -> 284.97s]  No, you don't. I look good for 34. That's what I tell, every time I get to look in the mirror. Anybody else do this? I stand in the mirror naked and just like move my shoulders around. Like you go like this, you just go, I look pretty good.
[285.81s -> 307.38s]  And then you fucking move on. What a fucking freak. Am I a freak? I just like move my body around. I don't flex in the mirror. I just like fucking move my arms and shoulders around for like five minutes. And then I say 34, by the way.
[309.62s -> 320.99s]  I say it like 10 times. I hear Kim walking back and forth, just like sighing. I don't know what that means. Does that, what does that mean?
[321.99s -> 342.90s]  Anyways, let's, let's do some videos. We're only going to be here for about four hours or so because I have to, got to go. So I got to leave by, what time is it? 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay. I got like, I got like four and a half hours.
[342.90s -> 359.40s]  Four hours. So the first one we're going to watch is Streamer's Choice. We're going to watch old videos. And Streamer's Choice is the video that I have to figure out right now because I didn't pick one.
[359.40s -> 388.18s]  Let me think here. What like old video do I want to watch? I don't have any. There's so many. Shit. I just went into like the chocolate store and went up to the front and the person behind the counter, like the candy, coffee, not the candy, the candy, the chocolate candy, the chocolate candy counter.
[389.18s -> 408.28s]  I got it. I figured it out. The lady at the chocolate candy counter is like, can I help you? No. Then you leave because you're fucking scared to pick chocolates. All right. I got one. I got one. I got one. Hold on.
[411.89s -> 425.54s]  Yeah. We'll, we'll watch the Wonder Book. We didn't, we didn't watch that one last time, did we? If you type in Wonder Book, which one? Book of Dinosaur? Book of Spells? I haven't seen these in a long time.
[425.54s -> 457.75s]  All right. We'll do Book of Spells. This thing was so fucking stupid. I look like a fucking psycho. God, that's short hair. Like just didn't do much justice for me, I don't think. Oh, but I forgot about the update. I have an update for, whoa, whoa, wait, hold on.
[457.75s -> 482.98s]  All right. This is Book of Spells. Okay. Don't mind me. I was just, I just, every couple of weeks, I just relive the fact that I beat Sekiro and I just like, I watch some of my old Sekiro playthroughs to make sure like, see how good I did.
[483.98s -> 525.22s]  Oh, this is Book of Spells. Hey, there it is. You guys want my dumb ass on camera? Or is there, that's how this works, right? Holy shit, hold on. I gotta like tape these down. It's, all right. It's getting to the point where I'm getting like old man, like fucking Christopher Lloyd hair back here. And I really considered at one point putting like masking tape just like this.
[525.22s -> 565.86s]  All right, let's go. Intro music? Is there, is there, did I just, there, let's go. You ready? This is the Wonder Book. Hopefully you can hear it. Oh, I'm ready. Oh, intro music. You mean the intro music was on. Okay. I fixed it. Why is the intro still on? I turned it off. All right. Here we go. Book of Spells.
[575.27s -> 579.27s]  Welcome to the, I found in my Book of Spells, it seems.
[583.20s -> 584.20s]  Wooden paneling.
[585.20s -> 586.20s]  We're going to go with Slytherin.
[587.20s -> 590.20s]  Because I have my ceremonial wizard garb on.
[593.30s -> 594.30s]  Look at my hand.
[595.30s -> 596.30s]  That's good comedy.
[596.30s -> 597.30s]  I'm like glitching through this.
[598.30s -> 599.30s]  You're going to take your wizard photo?
[600.30s -> 601.73s]  Okay.
[602.73s -> 603.73s]  Gave me my wizard photo.
[606.50s -> 609.50s]  Come on. I was, I was a fucking, I was a path maker.
[611.00s -> 613.00s]  Am, am I a wizard yet, mommy?
[614.00s -> 615.00s]  I was the AR guy.
[618.25s -> 619.25s]  Oh, it's a frog.
[621.25s -> 622.25s]  Whoa, look.
[623.25s -> 624.25s]  Oh shit.
[626.25s -> 627.25s]  Wee.
[628.25s -> 629.25s]  Where'd he go?
[631.25s -> 632.25s]  Come here.
[633.25s -> 634.25s]  Come here, frog.
[635.25s -> 636.25s]  I got ya.
[639.25s -> 640.25s]  Bye.
[641.25s -> 642.25s]  This shit was actually really cool.
[643.25s -> 644.25s]  No, come here.
[645.25s -> 646.25s]  Come here.
[647.25s -> 648.25s]  Ah, he's gone. See ya.
[649.55s -> 650.55s]  All right, get another frog. Good.
[651.55s -> 654.05s]  All right, I'm going to do, when guardian of the author.
[655.05s -> 656.05s]  He's saying so.
[657.05s -> 658.05s]  Oh, there's Mr. Frog.
[659.05s -> 660.05s]  Oh shit.
[661.05s -> 662.05s]  I need another frog.
[663.05s -> 664.05s]  I need another frog, please.
[665.05s -> 666.05s]  Respawn the frog, please. Thank you very much.
[667.05s -> 668.05s]  He looks so young.
[669.93s -> 670.93s]  Where am I supposed to put him?
[671.93s -> 672.93s]  He's going way too far away.
[673.93s -> 675.93s]  Of course, this toad was just conjured up.
[676.93s -> 677.93s]  Oh, there he goes.
[678.93s -> 679.93s]  You need to be a bit more careful.
[680.93s -> 681.93s]  Watch where you spray that thing.
[682.93s -> 684.17s]  Oh, where's the book?
[685.17s -> 686.17s]  Oh, that looks bad.
[687.17s -> 688.17s]  Oh, look out.
[689.17s -> 690.17s]  Look out, man. I got ya.
[691.17s -> 692.17s]  It's like a super soaker commercial.
[693.17s -> 694.17s]  That's a super soaker commercial.
[695.17s -> 696.17s]  I got ya.
[697.17s -> 698.17s]  Look out, Timmy.
[701.76s -> 702.76s]  What do you want?
[702.76s -> 703.76s]  Keep your wand under control.
[709.10s -> 710.40s]  Cool.
[711.40s -> 712.40s]  Let's go.
[713.40s -> 715.40s]  Let's move on and go back later if you like.
[717.34s -> 718.34s]  I look fucking 17.
[719.34s -> 727.62s]  Oh, fascinating.
[728.62s -> 729.62s]  It appears to be a hole in your book.
[730.62s -> 731.62s]  Oh, look at you seeing that hole there.
[732.62s -> 733.62s]  Look at it there.
[734.62s -> 735.62s]  Whoa.
[736.62s -> 737.62s]  I can't see you.
[738.62s -> 739.62s]  I feel like I'm on a Universal Studios ride.
[740.62s -> 742.18s]  Where's your book gone?
[743.18s -> 744.18s]  There we go.
[744.18s -> 746.32s]  There we go.
[747.32s -> 748.32s]  Nice tuber reactions.
[749.32s -> 750.32s]  These are pretty good tuber reactions, I would say.
[751.32s -> 752.32s]  Ow.
[753.32s -> 754.32s]  Ow.
[755.32s -> 756.62s]  What the fuck?
[757.62s -> 760.34s]  Oh, shit.
[761.34s -> 762.34s]  I'm back. I'm back.
[763.34s -> 764.34s]  It was a joke.
[765.34s -> 766.96s]  I'd still do that.
[767.96s -> 768.96s]  That was a joke.
[770.58s -> 771.58s]  I was just fucking around.
[772.58s -> 773.58s]  All right, let's go.
[774.58s -> 775.58s]  The master of the test.
[776.58s -> 777.58s]  What?
[778.58s -> 779.58s]  Oh.
[780.58s -> 781.58s]  All right, what am I doing?
[782.58s -> 783.58s]  My grandkids are going to see this.
[784.58s -> 785.58s]  They're going to feel like what the fuck was wrong.
[786.58s -> 787.58s]  What?
[788.58s -> 789.58s]  Oh, this is so fucking stressful.
[790.58s -> 791.58s]  To cast there, try again.
[792.58s -> 794.58s]  I think water is the key to solving this bit of the test.
[795.58s -> 796.58s]  That's water.
[797.82s -> 798.82s]  Oh.
[799.82s -> 800.82s]  All right, what am I doing?
[801.82s -> 806.20s]  Pull up the glowing text on the page to begin.
[807.20s -> 808.20s]  Oh, this is so fucking stressful.
[809.20s -> 810.20s]  Okay, I thought for a second I was speaking a different language.
[810.20s -> 812.20s]  I think water is the key to solving this bit of the test.
[813.20s -> 814.20s]  That's water. Isn't that water?
[815.20s -> 816.20s]  What?
[817.20s -> 819.20s]  Not quite sure which spell you were trying to cast there, try again.
[820.20s -> 821.20s]  What the fuck is it?
[822.20s -> 823.20s]  Not quite sure which spell you were trying to cast there, try again.
[824.20s -> 825.20s]  What is water?
[826.20s -> 827.20s]  Why am I looking down at the book to see what it is?
[828.20s -> 829.20s]  The book is not, there's nothing here.
[830.20s -> 831.20s]  That's not here.
[832.20s -> 833.20s]  Why am I?
[834.20s -> 835.20s]  Get some water in there.
[836.20s -> 837.20s]  Oh.
[837.20s -> 838.20s]  You should be able to run out of water.
[839.20s -> 840.20s]  Oh, I spilled it.
[841.20s -> 842.20s]  Oh, come on.
[843.20s -> 844.38s]  He's telling me that's not going to spill out.
[845.38s -> 846.87s]  Are you kidding me right now?
[847.87s -> 848.87s]  This is just like jello in here?
[849.87s -> 851.24s]  What the fuck is going on?
[852.24s -> 853.24s]  What the fuck did he say?
[854.24s -> 855.24s]  What?
[856.24s -> 857.24s]  It's me, I said it, it's me.
[858.24s -> 860.44s]  What the fuck?
[862.19s -> 863.19s]  I'm stuck right now.
[864.19s -> 865.19s]  See, this wasn't even like part of making a book.
[873.79s -> 874.79s]  Get up!
[874.79s -> 875.79s]  Get off of me!
[876.79s -> 877.79s]  I just do this shit.
[879.29s -> 880.29s]  What the fuck?
[881.29s -> 882.29s]  I'm stuck in my robes.
[883.29s -> 884.29s]  Remember how I told you about how, we're going to go back here.
[885.29s -> 886.29s]  Remember how I told you how I just do shit?
[887.29s -> 888.29s]  Remember, you cut up a video.
[889.29s -> 891.29s]  This video, I probably took like two or three hours playing this game.
[892.29s -> 893.29s]  And I was just sitting there doing this.
[894.29s -> 897.29s]  The only reason why this clip was used is because I got stuck instead of ripping my robe like in half.
[898.29s -> 899.29s]  That's the only reason why this is here.
[900.29s -> 904.29s]  This, what you're looking at right here, is what I probably did for 20 straight minutes.
[905.29s -> 906.29s]  ...in this chapter.
[912.20s -> 916.17s]  And now here's the part that I wanted to keep.
[918.62s -> 919.62s]  Get up!
[921.31s -> 922.74s]  Get off of me!
[923.74s -> 926.84s]  Fuck, I'm stuck in my robes.
[927.84s -> 928.84s]  You see these like birds, these butterflies?
[929.84s -> 930.84s]  I just really can't have a kiss.
[931.84s -> 932.84s]  Inspector Patronus!
[933.84s -> 934.84s]  I've had a kiss!
[935.84s -> 936.84s]  I've had a kiss!
[937.84s -> 938.84s]  I've had a kiss!
[939.84s -> 940.84s]  I've had a kiss!
[941.84s -> 942.84s]  I've had a kiss!
[943.84s -> 947.94s]  I've had a kiss!
[947.94s -> 949.94s]  Oh, this clock is broken.
[950.94s -> 951.94s]  I gotta...
[952.94s -> 953.94s]  Oh, it's all over me!
[954.94s -> 956.94s]  Oh, boy, what do I do?
[957.94s -> 958.94s]  Reparo!
[959.94s -> 961.94s]  Oh, come on now.
[962.94s -> 963.94s]  I get it.
[965.76s -> 966.76s]  I wasn't even trying.
[967.76s -> 968.76s]  Nearly there.
[969.76s -> 971.76s]  Trial number three looks straightforward.
[972.76s -> 975.76s]  My guess is you need to make things a bit more balanced.
[978.22s -> 979.39s]  Big!
[980.39s -> 984.39s]  A scorpion smaller won't help, making him larger might though.
[985.39s -> 986.39s]  Do I have to make the scorpion big?
[987.39s -> 988.39s]  Why do I use this?
[989.39s -> 990.39s]  I don't want a big-ass scorpion!
[991.39s -> 992.39s]  Wait, it's still glowing.
[993.39s -> 994.39s]  Does it look like stinging balls or something?
[995.39s -> 996.39s]  Why do I use this?
[997.39s -> 998.39s]  Hey! Hey! Hey!
[999.39s -> 1001.02s]  I'm in a kiss!
[1002.02s -> 1003.02s]  I guess this is kinda cool.
[1004.02s -> 1005.58s]  Shit.
[1006.58s -> 1007.58s]  Okay, I'm turning the page.
[1010.67s -> 1011.67s]  Oh, this is a classic.
[1011.67s -> 1012.67s]  This is classic, what happens here?
[1013.67s -> 1023.42s]  I think I busted it.
[1024.42s -> 1026.37s]  Classic.
[1027.37s -> 1028.80s]  I'm pretty sure I broke the book.
[1029.80s -> 1030.80s]  I'm pretty positive the book is all screwed up right now.
[1031.80s -> 1035.86s]  If I hold it...
[1036.86s -> 1037.86s]  Come on! Classic!
[1038.86s -> 1039.86s]  Come on!
[1040.86s -> 1041.86s]  What the fuck is going on?
[1042.86s -> 1043.86s]  The book is messed up!
[1046.38s -> 1047.38s]  Book of Spells, my ass!
[1050.09s -> 1051.09s]  How long does this go on for?
[1052.09s -> 1053.09s]  It's all glitched out.
[1054.52s -> 1055.52s]  It weighs like the calibrate button.
[1056.52s -> 1057.52s]  Cool, it's me, right?
[1062.52s -> 1063.52s]  Fuck off.
[1066.52s -> 1070.91s]  This is like last second parent Halloween costume.
[1071.91s -> 1072.91s]  I don't even give a shit!
[1073.91s -> 1076.92s]  That's like, oh, my kids want to go trick-or-treating.
[1077.92s -> 1080.10s]  Oh, may as well just put a hood on.
[1081.40s -> 1086.28s]  Now I'm a wizard or sorcerer or like a guy.
[1086.28s -> 1087.28s]  That was it.
[1089.21s -> 1090.21s]  That was the book of spells.
[1091.21s -> 1094.90s]  If you're new to this channel or you haven't been here for that long,
[1095.90s -> 1100.03s]  there are like two more of those and we're going to suffer through them right now.
[1101.03s -> 1102.03s]  No, that was fun.
[1103.03s -> 1104.03s]  That was a fun video.
[1105.03s -> 1108.45s]  What was wrong with that?
[1109.45s -> 1111.01s]  We're going to suffer through it.
[1112.01s -> 1113.01s]  First let me find it.
[1115.53s -> 1116.53s]  Oh, the update.
[1117.83s -> 1118.83s]  The update, the update, the update.
[1120.14s -> 1121.14s]  What's the point of this stream?
[1122.14s -> 1123.14s]  This is one of the most highly requested streams.
[1124.31s -> 1125.94s]  I get it all the time.
[1126.94s -> 1131.84s]  A lot of people want me to watch old videos of mine.
[1132.84s -> 1136.46s]  So the point is to just hang out and watch for a couple hours.
[1137.46s -> 1141.66s]  I mean, there's not really, there is no like point.
[1143.54s -> 1146.54s]  I mean, the point is just to remember things and watch things.
[1147.54s -> 1148.54s]  I don't know, just for fun.
[1152.28s -> 1153.28s]  Oh, the update.
[1154.28s -> 1155.28s]  Let's just say it.
[1156.28s -> 1157.28s]  The robot carnival stream.
[1158.28s -> 1160.28s]  Let's get on camera for this because I want people to make sure
[1160.28s -> 1162.28s]  that they can see my mouth moving and shit.
[1163.28s -> 1170.22s]  The robot carnival stream is going to have a hard date in like less than a week.
[1171.22s -> 1176.36s]  That shit is going to be on total fucking lockdown and it's going to happen in September.
[1177.36s -> 1180.05s]  And I will have a real hard actual date.
[1181.05s -> 1184.54s]  And we'll be talking about this all for the next two months straight.
[1185.54s -> 1189.91s]  I'm going to have to fly out like two or three times to this facility
[1190.91s -> 1191.91s]  because it's not happening in Vegas.
[1191.91s -> 1192.91s]  It's not happening in Vegas.
[1193.91s -> 1196.91s]  This is happening on location somewhere because it's not here.
[1197.91s -> 1199.91s]  So an announcement of an announcement.
[1200.91s -> 1206.22s]  Well, the announcement of the announcement is that it's going to be late September.
[1208.61s -> 1209.61s]  I can't give you the exact day in September,
[1210.61s -> 1212.61s]  but just know that it's probably going to be the last week or so of September.
[1219.54s -> 1225.18s]  It's probably going to be, well, you'll see, alien carnival.
[1226.18s -> 1228.38s]  What do you mean alien carnival?
[1229.38s -> 1233.75s]  What does that mean?
[1234.75s -> 1235.75s]  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[1236.75s -> 1237.75s]  Explain this to me.
[1238.75s -> 1243.18s]  I get all of my fucking meme news from like you guys.
[1244.18s -> 1245.18s]  So I need to be dealt with.
[1246.18s -> 1247.18s]  What is this Area 51 thing?
[1248.18s -> 1250.00s]  I don't get it.
[1251.00s -> 1252.30s]  I don't understand what this is.
[1253.30s -> 1255.30s]  Area 51, we'll go and find the aliens.
[1256.61s -> 1259.64s]  I don't understand.
[1260.64s -> 1261.64s]  People are planning to raid Area 51.
[1262.64s -> 1270.54s]  That's it.
[1271.54s -> 1275.64s]  That's the joke?
[1275.64s -> 1279.64s]  So that's like a thing on Facebook that you sign up for and like five million people say like, yes, I'm going to go.
[1280.64s -> 1284.64s]  And just like your fucking birthday party that you do on Facebook, like three people show up.
[1286.65s -> 1287.65s]  Like, why the fuck did you accept the Facebook invite?
[1288.65s -> 1290.27s]  Don't do that.
[1291.27s -> 1292.27s]  Just ignore it.
[1293.27s -> 1296.88s]  Just pretend like you didn't fucking see it.
[1297.88s -> 1298.88s]  I would rather you pretend you didn't see it than say yes.
[1300.25s -> 1304.25s]  By the way, you're going to get liquidated if you fucking try to do that.
[1305.25s -> 1307.25s]  They have like liquidation rays pointing like in corners.
[1308.25s -> 1309.25s]  Are you serious?
[1310.25s -> 1314.83s]  You're going to be like, your body's just going to fucking, I ain't doing that.
[1315.83s -> 1317.97s]  All right, let's get the next video.
[1322.28s -> 1324.28s]  In fact, those liquidation rays happen so fast, you don't even know what happened.
[1325.28s -> 1327.65s]  You'll be talking to somebody next to you.
[1328.65s -> 1330.65s]  And you'll like turn like this to like look over you like a bird will fly by.
[1331.65s -> 1332.65s]  You'll turn, the person's gone.
[1333.65s -> 1334.65s]  It happens so fast.
[1335.65s -> 1336.82s]  You don't even hear a noise.
[1337.82s -> 1338.82s]  You'd be like, oh, hey, yeah, you got the supplies.
[1339.82s -> 1340.82s]  You get the Campbell's tomato soups.
[1341.82s -> 1342.82s]  We're going to need those.
[1343.82s -> 1344.82s]  The tents are set up and they're gone.
[1344.82s -> 1345.82s]  And those people are gone too.
[1346.82s -> 1350.37s]  You won't even know.
[1354.81s -> 1359.95s]  Cut his mic.
[1361.77s -> 1362.77s]  Everybody knows this.
[1363.77s -> 1364.77s]  Okay, this is not.
[1367.54s -> 1373.85s]  Guys, the Area 51 was a meme back when our parents didn't even know what the word meme was.
[1374.85s -> 1378.28s]  They've got a little gray guy in the Area 51.
[1379.28s -> 1381.28s]  Did you see the pictures?
[1382.28s -> 1383.28s]  That was like fucking 80 years ago.
[1384.28s -> 1385.28s]  This is like, this is old news.
[1386.28s -> 1395.71s]  You're on old news now.
[1396.71s -> 1400.40s]  All right, let's do book of dinosaurs.
[1411.11s -> 1415.85s]  Just move the secret stuff there.
[1416.85s -> 1417.85s]  Yeah. Okay.
[1418.85s -> 1422.85s]  If you were the government and people knew that Area 51 was like the jokey alien place.
[1424.47s -> 1425.47s]  Don't you think that that would just be like a.
[1426.47s -> 1427.47s]  Oh, yeah.
[1428.47s -> 1429.47s]  Area 51.
[1430.47s -> 1431.47s]  That's right, guys.
[1432.47s -> 1433.47s]  Don't say anything.
[1434.47s -> 1435.47s]  That's where the aliens are.
[1436.84s -> 1437.84s]  No, they're fucking somewhere else.
[1439.34s -> 1440.34s]  I should know.
[1441.34s -> 1442.34s]  That's in my backyard.
[1443.34s -> 1444.34s]  That's it. That's it. That's in Nevada.
[1445.34s -> 1446.34s]  That's it. I know. I know the state.
[1449.94s -> 1450.94s]  There's nothing there.
[1455.96s -> 1456.96s]  I know my state is a young German.
[1457.96s -> 1466.11s]  Again, this time it was a hat on though.
[1469.08s -> 1470.08s]  That's it.
[1471.08s -> 1472.08s]  You want to talk about like the ultimate boomer meme?
[1473.08s -> 1474.08s]  It's like Area 51 has aliens.
[1475.08s -> 1477.08s]  Today, we're going to find out something really important.
[1478.08s -> 1481.08s]  Real important to me, real important to you, real important to the social studies of your school.
[1482.08s -> 1484.32s]  Ask your professor, ask your teacher this or a guardian.
[1485.32s -> 1486.32s]  What happened to the dinosaurs?
[1487.32s -> 1488.32s]  Did they get extinct?
[1489.32s -> 1494.59s]  Did they get extinct?
[1495.59s -> 1498.30s]  Oh, preparation.
[1500.44s -> 1505.13s]  Use your hammer to crack open the shells.
[1506.13s -> 1508.13s]  Use my hammer to crack open the shells.
[1509.13s -> 1512.13s]  This is the kind of power that I don't want to have.
[1513.13s -> 1514.13s]  You want me to smash up these eggs?
[1523.11s -> 1524.11s]  Easy.
[1525.11s -> 1527.18s]  Frustration.
[1528.18s -> 1529.18s]  They're OK.
[1530.18s -> 1533.18s]  This is one of the rarest things I've ever come across.
[1534.18s -> 1535.18s]  That's an archaeologist.
[1536.55s -> 1537.55s]  That wasn't right.
[1538.55s -> 1539.55s]  That wasn't right.
[1540.55s -> 1541.55s]  You need to really look and find them.
[1542.55s -> 1543.55s]  They're hidden all over the place.
[1544.55s -> 1545.55s]  Check it out over there to the right.
[1546.55s -> 1547.55s]  You might be able to find one.
[1553.66s -> 1554.66s]  What the fuck? Oh, right.
[1555.66s -> 1558.96s]  Juniper, I've got a little snack for you.
[1559.96s -> 1560.96s]  Come look. It's a snack.
[1561.96s -> 1562.96s]  You're hungry, aren't you?
[1564.46s -> 1565.46s]  Come on.
[1566.46s -> 1567.46s]  Come get it.
[1567.46s -> 1568.46s]  Put that in mine.
[1572.70s -> 1573.70s]  Oh, she's really nervous.
[1574.70s -> 1576.70s]  Try gently waving the plant to make it come closer.
[1577.70s -> 1578.70s]  And keep it nice and quiet.
[1579.70s -> 1587.47s]  It's a fucking cartoon clutch.
[1588.47s -> 1589.47s]  I didn't think I'd be taking a quiz.
[1590.47s -> 1591.47s]  Which of these animals is the loudest?
[1592.47s -> 1595.86s]  Is it a blue whale?
[1598.19s -> 1599.19s]  A howler monkey?
[1600.37s -> 1601.37s]  A bullfrog?
[1602.37s -> 1603.37s]  A tiger?
[1604.37s -> 1605.37s]  Bullfrog, final answer.
[1607.89s -> 1608.89s]  Bullfrog, final answer.
[1608.89s -> 1609.89s]  No, I didn't want to.
[1610.89s -> 1611.89s]  Of course, of course, tiger.
[1612.89s -> 1613.89s]  No, bullfrog.
[1614.89s -> 1615.89s]  It is a bullfrog.
[1616.89s -> 1617.89s]  It is a bullfrog.
[1618.89s -> 1619.89s]  Bullfrog is the loudest animal on earth.
[1621.13s -> 1622.13s]  How could you not know that?
[1623.13s -> 1624.13s]  How do you make that mistake not knowing that?
[1625.13s -> 1626.82s]  What is it, a fucking blue whale?
[1627.82s -> 1628.82s]  Oh, yeah.
[1629.82s -> 1633.42s]  Yeah, in your fucking made up history books.
[1634.42s -> 1635.66s]  You looking at me?

[1661.14s -> 1662.14s]  What the hell are you talking about?
[1664.14s -> 1665.14s]  That's what I'm doing.
[1667.14s -> 1668.14s]  That's the front cover.
[1669.14s -> 1670.14s]  Is this not the front cover?
[1676.14s -> 1679.12s]  You'll need to turn the ones but there was sounds like trouble
[1679.98s -> 1685.06s]  This was way in the fights time though. Are we gonna get to see a fight?
[1685.86s -> 1688.54s]  All right. Let's take a look

[1714.26s -> 1716.26s]  Why do I have to be the bush creep every single time?
[1716.26s -> 1720.22s]  Why can't you just like be in like why can't I be riding on the back of the triceratops?
[1720.22s -> 1723.94s]  You know, I mean, I should be riding on his back and like throwing bricks

[1830.20s -> 1831.16s]  Been over

[1835.89s -> 1838.77s]  You know how much you have any idea how much it costs for a wonder book?
[1839.57s -> 1840.85s]  five bucks
[1840.85s -> 1843.09s]  Yeah, it's fucking cheap
[1844.05s -> 1856.17s]  It was but that was five dollars the games on the other hand were like 20
[1856.29s -> 1861.99s]  How much of that? How much of those right now? That was like ten years ago, right?
[1862.67s -> 1864.59s]  2012 2013

[1889.07s -> 1891.07s]  Yeah, but
[1891.11s -> 1895.21s]  It's selling for $15 on Amazon. So I got up a five bucks
[1895.69s -> 1901.97s]  Five ten fit. That's a two. That's like a two hundred percent increase. I would have a two three X to my money
[1902.17s -> 1903.81s]  That's a big deal
[1903.81s -> 1913.47s]  Four dollars plus shipping on eBay. Never mind. Okay, so I didn't make any money. I didn't make any theoretical money here
[1914.86s -> 1918.38s]  So that was our book of spells. There's one more might as well just do the whole saga
[1918.98s -> 1922.24s]  There's book of potions

[2200.14s -> 2201.50s]  Dump the
[2201.50s -> 2211.42s]  Fuck is right. It's like a pepperoni pizza. It'll cure him. I don't get him in there. Just dunk him a little bit

[2257.69s -> 2259.69s]  He's not like he's not like releasing a book
[2260.37s -> 2265.61s]  Look at look at her like rare auto yawn in the corner. I didn't know he was in this video. There's no couch

[2276.97s -> 2278.97s]  After that

[2289.33s -> 2291.87s]  You want to get arrested? That's how you get arrested
[2291.97s -> 2295.45s]  That's how you get the health inspector to be like you're putting blood in your fucking food
[2296.05s -> 2297.81s]  your blood
[2297.81s -> 2300.24s]  My restaurants gonna be closed

[2311.06s -> 2318.69s]  I had green blood. I don't have green blood. I'm pretty my blood's red
[2328.11s -> 2333.44s]  Kid humor there it is. I would still do that. No, that's not kid humor. I would do that
[2334.48s -> 2337.40s]  If that was sitting on my lap right now, I would do that right now
[2344.84s -> 2349.31s]  I
[2350.63s -> 2357.14s]  Forgot how fucking dumb these really were I stupid that's covered in shrinking solution
[2357.96s -> 2366.02s]  He's just a little baby. Well, he certainly won't stop us passing by now
[2367.02s -> 2369.96s]  for the knife
[2369.96s -> 2385.20s]  Can this chop dude a horn? Here it is again
[2386.76s -> 2389.26s]  Just
[2393.04s -> 2395.56s]  You know what the most fucked up thing is this entire time
[2395.96s -> 2401.52s]  I haven't even had a chance to sample my own material. I've been able to change to drink my own fucking potions
[2402.14s -> 2404.37s]  That's changing right now
[2404.37s -> 2410.88s]  Whoa?
[2410.88s -> 2413.95s]  Whoa, that's spicy. Whoo
[2414.77s -> 2418.65s]  Whoo at first. I really didn't think I was gonna like that but
[2419.29s -> 2421.18s]  man
[2421.18s -> 2423.36s]  That was pretty tasty
[2424.00s -> 2440.19s]  That's my favorite. That's one of my favorite old jokes. I do this like four times
[2440.55s -> 2444.77s]  How many times did it did I actually do that?
[2445.17s -> 2450.38s]  That I had to have used it like this and same ambulance thing like three or four times
[2450.76s -> 2462.69s]  There's like so many like people here to take what happened to me
[2463.17s -> 2471.74s]  There's like three paramedics like a two fireman a spit just went flying. I don't know if you caught that one, but it's gross
[2472.54s -> 2477.79s]  No, no story electro. Don't
[2478.19s -> 2484.73s]  Does it happen in that too? No, it doesn't doesn't hold on. Does it actually happen in that video?
[2485.25s -> 2491.33s]  That video is kind of fucked up, isn't it?
[2491.81s -> 2510.27s]  I remember this video being like strange. I forget let's watch it. This is right before
[2511.23s -> 2515.55s]  Metal Gear Solid 5 I really tried to like jump on the Metal Gear Solid 5 like train
[2516.11s -> 2518.11s]  Because it was a big deal that that game was coming out
[2518.59s -> 2527.97s]  And I was like, hold on. Oh, let me let me like try to do something cool
[2527.97s -> 2534.63s]  And that thought it was funny because the story is like fucking I don't think I could
[2535.87s -> 2540.29s]  Metal Gear Solid and Kingdom Hearts of the same game in regards to storylines
[2540.77s -> 2543.49s]  They may as well just be the same exact story
[2544.25s -> 2549.97s]  Explain to me Kingdom Hearts storyline, but replace the Kingdom Hearts characters with people from Metal Gear Solid and vice versa
[2550.49s -> 2552.33s]  You'd have the same story
[2552.33s -> 2561.22s]  Once he got to Metal Gear Solid 2 and they started going that the last like hour-long cutscene
[2561.74s -> 2566.85s]  May as well have been fucking Sora and Roxas like playing rock-paper-scissors
[2567.77s -> 2570.57s]  Here we go. I
[2570.77s -> 2581.69s]  Forget this whole video. I hear it's a good game. I hear it's an incredible franchise
[2582.53s -> 2587.97s]  I haven't played Metal Gear Solid since I was probably 16. I played the first one and I played the second one
[2587.97s -> 2593.89s]  It's true. I don't know the story and it's become so complicated and so intertwined at this point
[2593.89s -> 2600.54s]  I seriously don't even know where I would even start dozens of hours of cutscenes tons of reading
[2600.54s -> 2606.79s]  I don't got time to read you who's got time to read nowadays, you know, so what I did is I picked up this
[2607.19s -> 2609.26s]  this is
[2609.26s -> 2611.43s]  got this online a
[2612.07s -> 2614.07s]  Comprehensive Metal Gear
[2614.43s -> 2616.03s]  NeuroStory ElectroDump
[2616.03s -> 2622.55s]  They have them for all kinds of things. This is for Metal Gear because obviously the story is so complicated like we've talked about
[2623.35s -> 2632.66s]  So that goes into the CD tray. I think it's just a standard disc at this only now we put on the electrodes goes there
[2633.18s -> 2636.46s]  Okay
[2636.46s -> 2644.89s]  Standard USB it goes right in the back of your computer. Just like that. That should be it. Oh
[2645.65s -> 2650.18s]  My teeth. Oh
[2650.46s -> 2662.36s]  That's my favorite joke in the whole video. Okay, let's all get hype for Metal Gear Solid 5 get hype play button

[2802.59s -> 2805.15s]  It's called this
[2805.15s -> 2807.15s]  They filmed at different times
[2807.15s -> 2810.42s]  I think I stayed up really late for this one
[2810.42s -> 2815.98s]  I'm pretty pale

[2829.86s -> 2831.86s]  We're watching the basketball video
[2831.86s -> 2833.86s]  When this first released
[2833.86s -> 2835.86s]  People were like what the fuck is this
[2835.86s -> 2837.86s]  And let me tell you something about this video
[2837.86s -> 2839.86s]  This is no
[2839.86s -> 2841.86s]  I did not cheat in this video people thought
[2841.86s -> 2843.86s]  People thought that cheats existed to do this
[2843.86s -> 2846.03s]  Oh no they didn't no they
[2846.03s -> 2848.03s]  Did not I was on a call I think
[2848.03s -> 2850.03s]  With like MLC Stealth
[2850.03s -> 2852.03s]  And Star maybe I think I remember at the time
[2852.03s -> 2854.03s]  I was trying
[2854.03s -> 2856.03s]  I was over and over and over again
[2856.03s -> 2858.03s]  Throwing the fucking ball from across the
[2858.03s -> 2860.03s]  Entire fucking court
[2860.03s -> 2862.03s]  Over and over and over
[2862.03s -> 2864.03s]  Until I captured it and edited together
[2864.03s -> 2866.03s]  It took like 12 fucking
[2866.03s -> 2868.03s]  Hours to do this
[2868.03s -> 2870.03s]  You can't do this in this game
[2870.03s -> 2872.03s]  This is real we're watching it right now
[2872.03s -> 2875.98s]  Can I even click it?
[2875.98s -> 2877.98s]  People thought I cheated on that one no no no
[2877.98s -> 2880.29s]  You can't do that in this game
[2880.29s -> 2882.29s]  You'll know what I'm talking about very soon
[2882.29s -> 2884.29s]  That's my favorite video I think ever
[2884.29s -> 2889.92s]  I love this video let's watch it
[2889.92s -> 2892.42s]  And I remember when I was putting it together
[2892.42s -> 2894.98s]  I was like this is a sports video
[2894.98s -> 2896.98s]  Is anybody gonna give a shit about this video
[2896.98s -> 2899.54s]  And then I was like whatever
[2899.54s -> 2901.54s]  It was I thought it was funny
[2901.54s -> 2903.54s]  And that's all that really mattered at that point
[2903.54s -> 2905.54s]  I think it's funny I'm gonna
[2905.54s -> 2909.82s]  Put it up let me get it hold on
[2909.82s -> 2916.21s]  Move out of the way I fucking
[2916.21s -> 2923.70s]  Love this video
[2923.70s -> 2925.70s]  And editing this together was hell too
[2925.70s -> 2927.70s]  Because I had to make it look like it was really happening
[2927.70s -> 2932.82s]  There you go this is your insight
[2932.82s -> 2934.82s]  This is not done with cheats
[2934.82s -> 2937.31s]  This is the real deal
[2937.31s -> 2941.79s]  Nice hit
[2941.79s -> 2944.03s]  Nice hit
[2944.03s -> 2946.03s]  Today's video we're gonna open up a box
[2946.03s -> 2948.03s]  On camera
[2948.03s -> 2950.03s]  Oh I've already done it
[2950.03s -> 2952.03s]  I've already done it
[2954.53s -> 2956.53s]  Mayo coming up the front of the court over the Boston Celtics
[2956.53s -> 2958.53s]  Side passing it over to Knight
[2958.53s -> 2960.53s]  Knight layup that's two points for Milwaukee
[2960.53s -> 2962.53s]  Good score
[2962.53s -> 2964.53s]  Now we've got Gabe Groom and Degrossi gonna do well
[2964.53s -> 2966.53s]  That's what he typically does
[2966.53s -> 2968.53s]  And it's in another three points
[2968.53s -> 2970.53s]  Oh a Boston Celtics
[2970.53s -> 2972.53s]  A deficit like this is gonna be hard to come back from
[2972.53s -> 2974.53s]  For the Milwaukee Brews
[2974.53s -> 2976.53s]  But maybe they can mount something
[2976.53s -> 2978.53s]  They need to get some type of offense and keep the defense alive
[2978.53s -> 2980.53s]  Oh what a fake there passing it over to Sanders
[2980.53s -> 2982.53s]  Two points
[2982.53s -> 2984.53s]  For Milwaukee again
[2984.53s -> 2986.53s]  You gotta give Milwaukee some credit here though
[2986.53s -> 2988.53s]  They've showed perseverance this entire game
[2988.53s -> 2990.53s]  How do you go up against a team like the Celtics of 1997
[2990.53s -> 2992.53s]  I'm not entirely sure to Degrossi now
[2992.53s -> 2994.53s]  Passing technique
[2994.53s -> 2996.53s]  That's another three points
[2996.53s -> 2998.53s]  I hear the speechlessness in my voice
[2998.53s -> 3000.53s]  It's because I need somebody call a
[3000.53s -> 3002.53s]  Nuclear physicist right now
[3002.53s -> 3004.53s]  And ask them how this is even
[3004.53s -> 3006.53s]  Possible to score three points
[3006.53s -> 3008.53s]  Every single possession the entire
[3008.53s -> 3010.53s]  Season
[3010.53s -> 3012.53s]  You've got Gabe the glue man Degrossi
[3012.53s -> 3014.53s]  They gave him that name because he's got hands like glue
[3014.53s -> 3016.53s]  And he can throw the ball so well
[3016.53s -> 3018.53s]  And he was able to teach the entire team
[3018.53s -> 3020.53s]  How to do this
[3020.53s -> 3022.53s]  And I just don't understand and Degrossi's not gonna get the ball
[3022.53s -> 3024.53s]  Of Wallace, Wallace is gonna do it now
[3024.53s -> 3026.53s]  That's gonna be three points
[3026.53s -> 3028.53s]  They've never missed one time the whole season
[3028.53s -> 3030.53s]  I haven't casted a game
[3030.53s -> 3032.53s]  From the Celtics but this is the first time
[3032.53s -> 3034.53s]  I've casted a Celtics game and I must tell you
[3034.53s -> 3036.53s]  Ladies and gentlemen this is
[3036.53s -> 3038.53s]  One of the most remarkable basketball games
[3038.53s -> 3040.53s]  I have ever encountered in my entire
[3040.53s -> 3042.53s]  67 years on the planet
[3042.53s -> 3044.53s]  So now we're gonna just try to calm
[3044.53s -> 3046.53s]  Down here glue man, how do you
[3046.53s -> 3048.53s]  Calm down, how do you calm down
[3048.53s -> 3050.53s]  When something like that happens, how do you calm down
[3050.53s -> 3052.53s]  How am I supposed to
[3052.53s -> 3054.53s]  Judge night's got the ball now we have night
[3054.53s -> 3056.53s]  On the Milwaukee team with the ball
[3056.53s -> 3058.53s]  He's gonna try to come up court, he's gonna do a jump shot right
[3058.53s -> 3060.53s]  In the pan and he misses but Frank Pizza's got the ball
[3060.53s -> 3062.53s]  Now Frank Pizza with a toss, this is for real
[3062.53s -> 3064.53s]  Oh
[3064.53s -> 3066.53s]  He missed it, Frank Pizza
[3066.53s -> 3068.53s]  Just missed the first shot
[3068.53s -> 3070.53s]  Of the entire season
[3070.53s -> 3072.53s]  And that's just unbelievable, I really can't
[3072.53s -> 3074.53s]  Believe that and of all the things we've seen here
[3074.53s -> 3076.53s]  Tonight ladies and gentlemen I can tell you I did
[3076.53s -> 3078.53s]  Not expect Frank Pizza to be
[3078.53s -> 3080.53s]  The guy to ruin the streak of the Boston Celtics
[3080.53s -> 3082.53s]  But can we start it again?
[3082.53s -> 3084.53s]  We're gonna start it again
[3084.53s -> 3086.53s]  Start that counter at zero and add one to it ladies and gentlemen
[3086.53s -> 3088.53s]  Because that is the first of many
[3088.53s -> 3090.53s]  From these Boston Celtics
[3090.53s -> 3092.53s]  They are making a speed leave again
[3092.53s -> 3094.53s]  Which is something that their GM
[3094.53s -> 3096.53s]  Over and over again has said in
[3096.53s -> 3098.53s]  Interviews, Dan Bringus we caught up
[3098.53s -> 3100.53s]  With him earlier this afternoon
[3100.53s -> 3102.53s]  Look I'm gonna say the same thing
[3102.53s -> 3104.53s]  I've said like 12 times now
[3104.53s -> 3106.53s]  I fucking hate this job
[3106.53s -> 3108.53s]  And I hate this whole fucking organization
[3108.53s -> 3110.53s]  And this whole throw the ball as hard as you can
[3110.53s -> 3112.53s]  From the back of the court
[3112.53s -> 3114.53s]  Was a joke to get me fired
[3114.53s -> 3116.70s]  And it didn't work
[3138.70s -> 3140.70s]  Boston Celtics are going to win
[3140.70s -> 3142.70s]  In near perfect fashion
[3142.70s -> 3144.70s]  And because obviously
[3144.70s -> 3146.70s]  It's the end of the game as we see the players
[3146.70s -> 3148.70s]  All take off into their respective locker rooms
[3148.70s -> 3150.70s]  I'm gonna have to give the player
[3150.70s -> 3152.70s]  Of the game award to
[3152.70s -> 3154.70s]  Gabe Gloomander Grossi
[3154.70s -> 3156.70s]  That's right the fan favorite you all know him
[3156.70s -> 3158.70s]  You all love him I really truly think
[3158.70s -> 3160.70s]  He is one of the best players to ever live
[3160.70s -> 3162.70s]  And honestly
[3162.70s -> 3164.70s]  I hope to God nothing
[3164.70s -> 3166.70s]  Bad happens to this guy like
[3166.70s -> 3168.70s]  10 years from now
[3168.70s -> 3171.50s]  I really can't believe
[3171.50s -> 3173.50s]  Frank Peets is missing the first shot of the whole season
[3173.50s -> 3177.34s]  It was worth it
[3177.34s -> 3179.52s]  I remember like
[3179.52s -> 3181.52s]  Like 8 hours into trying to get this to happen
[3181.52s -> 3183.52s]  Being like
[3183.52s -> 3185.52s]  This ain't worth it
[3185.52s -> 3187.52s]  This is not fucking worth me doing this
[3187.52s -> 3189.52s]  It was absolutely
[3189.52s -> 3191.52s]  I'm not entirely sure to Grossi now
[3191.52s -> 3193.52s]  Passing technique
[3193.52s -> 3195.52s]  Doing that from across the court
[3195.52s -> 3197.52s]  I don't know which one it was
[3197.52s -> 3199.52s]  Maybe like 15 or 14
[3199.52s -> 3201.52s]  Whatever it was
[3201.52s -> 3203.95s]  You can't do that
[3203.95s -> 3205.95s]  That's so rare
[3205.95s -> 3207.95s]  In life and in games
[3207.95s -> 3210.58s]  Oh it was like
[3210.58s -> 3213.07s]  1 in fucking 50 it happened
[3213.07s -> 3216.21s]  Something like that
[3222.21s -> 3224.21s]  You couldn't make them
[3224.21s -> 3226.21s]  You had to like play through my like
[3226.21s -> 3228.21s]  Career mode or something to get them to build up
[3228.21s -> 3230.21s]  You can only make one person
[3230.21s -> 3232.21s]  And ask them
[3232.21s -> 3234.21s]  How is it even possible to score
[3234.21s -> 3236.21s]  3 points every single possession
[3236.21s -> 3238.21s]  The entire season
[3238.21s -> 3240.21s]  You've got Gabe the glue man to Grossi
[3240.21s -> 3242.21s]  These are all edits right
[3242.21s -> 3245.14s]  So here's the thing
[3245.14s -> 3247.57s]  This down here
[3247.57s -> 3249.57s]  It's covering up the real scores
[3249.57s -> 3251.57s]  Because this jumps around I wish I could move this out of the way
[3251.57s -> 3253.57s]  So you could see
[3253.57s -> 3255.57s]  But like for instance right here
[3255.57s -> 3257.57s]  Because he's got hands like glue
[3257.57s -> 3259.57s]  Right
[3259.57s -> 3261.57s]  And he was able to teach the entire
[3261.57s -> 3263.57s]  This is a completely different cut
[3263.57s -> 3266.00s]  This is a different clip
[3266.00s -> 3268.00s]  Because I had to Frankenstein them all together
[3268.00s -> 3270.43s]  To make any sense
[3270.43s -> 3272.43s]  So every time
[3272.43s -> 3274.43s]  Somebody on their team scores a basket
[3274.43s -> 3276.43s]  It's a new clip
[3276.43s -> 3282.51s]  After that
[3282.51s -> 3284.51s]  But once I went all in on it I was like I have to do that
[3284.51s -> 3286.51s]  How to do this
[3286.51s -> 3288.51s]  I just don't understand
[3288.51s -> 3290.51s]  And Grossi is not going to get the ball to Wallace
[3290.51s -> 3293.46s]  I love this
[3293.46s -> 3295.95s]  I love this video
[3295.95s -> 3299.07s]  That was like it was worth it
[3299.07s -> 3301.07s]  Compare the scores on the hoop
[3301.07s -> 3304.08s]  Are there scores on the hoop
[3304.08s -> 3306.08s]  Oh 24
[3306.08s -> 3308.08s]  Right
[3308.08s -> 3310.08s]  Okay so 24
[3310.08s -> 3312.08s]  No no no
[3312.08s -> 3314.08s]  That's the
[3314.08s -> 3316.08s]  Shot clock
[3316.08s -> 3318.08s]  That's not the points
[3318.08s -> 3320.64s]  That's the shot clock
[3320.64s -> 3326.72s]  Alright so what's up next
[3326.72s -> 3328.72s]  I picked them let's see
[3328.72s -> 3333.07s]  Let's get some patch notes
[3333.07s -> 3335.70s]  Yeah patch notes
[3335.70s -> 3341.01s]  We'll do patch notes
[3341.01s -> 3343.01s]  This is actually one of the last videos I made
[3343.01s -> 3347.87s]  Yeah I think this
[3347.87s -> 3352.42s]  Is this the last video I made
[3352.42s -> 3354.72s]  Yeah I think so right
[3354.72s -> 3359.84s]  Let's see
[3359.84s -> 3362.91s]  Because it was JermaRumble Live
[3362.91s -> 3368.22s]  Was after that right
[3368.22s -> 3371.36s]  Yeah we are about to witness right now
[3371.36s -> 3373.36s]  The last
[3373.36s -> 3375.36s]  Like at my desk
[3375.36s -> 3382.46s]  The last video I ever made
[3382.46s -> 3384.46s]  It's interesting
[3384.46s -> 3386.64s]  It's kind of like a culmination
[3386.64s -> 3388.64s]  Of like
[3388.64s -> 3390.64s]  How I felt about YouTube at the time
[3390.64s -> 3392.88s]  Weirdly enough
[3392.88s -> 3409.20s]  You'll see what I'm talking about
[3409.20s -> 3411.20s]  Alright here we go this is called
[3411.20s -> 3419.95s]  Patch notes
[3419.95s -> 3421.95s]  So I feel a little bit bad
[3421.95s -> 3423.95s]  That I haven't been covering as many games
[3423.95s -> 3425.95s]  As I used to on this channel
[3425.95s -> 3427.95s]  I used to go over patch notes, game updates
[3427.95s -> 3429.95s]  How I felt about them
[3429.95s -> 3431.95s]  In a very long time
[3431.95s -> 3433.95s]  So I wanted to play catch up with myself
[3433.95s -> 3435.95s]  In a sense and go over
[3435.95s -> 3437.95s]  All of them
[3437.95s -> 3439.95s]  All the patches and updates that I wanted to cover
[3439.95s -> 3441.95s]  That I didn't get a chance to cover over the last 3 years
[3441.95s -> 3444.13s]  So this one's probably going to be quite a long one
[3444.13s -> 3446.13s]  We're going to go over all these patches
[3446.13s -> 3448.13s]  And we're going to start with Team Fortress 2
[3448.13s -> 3450.13s]  The invasion update
[3450.13s -> 3452.13s]  Get yourself excited
[3452.13s -> 3454.13s]  Are you excited? Well you should be
[3454.13s -> 3456.13s]  We're talking about patches here
[3456.13s -> 3458.13s]  Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the patch video
[3458.13s -> 3460.13s]  Hey hey hey
[3460.13s -> 3462.13s]  Whoa whoa
[3462.13s -> 3464.13s]  You're fast boarding right now
[3464.13s -> 3466.13s]  I just want to make sure your finger is holding
[3466.13s -> 3468.13s]  You're doing that intentionally?
[3468.13s -> 3470.13s]  Is that another mistake?
[3470.13s -> 3472.13s]  I'll let them talk
[3472.13s -> 3474.13s]  Why did the rat just come here?
[3474.13s -> 3476.13s]  Why did the rat just come here?
[3476.13s -> 3478.13s]  Why did the rat just come here?
[3478.13s -> 3480.13s]  Remember how annoying that was with light poles?
[3480.13s -> 3482.13s]  Okay listen
[3482.13s -> 3484.13s]  I
[3484.13s -> 3486.13s]  I sometimes
[3486.13s -> 3488.13s]  Skip all of Overwatch
[3488.13s -> 3490.13s]  Because that was a pretty big deal
[3490.13s -> 3492.13s]  Look
[3492.13s -> 3494.13s]  This video took me like 3 months to make
[3494.13s -> 3496.13s]  So I don't want to be like a dick about it
[3496.13s -> 3498.13s]  But if you could just pick something
[3498.13s -> 3500.13s]  So I could at least feel like it mattered
[3500.13s -> 3502.13s]  We have one for Nazgoth here
[3502.13s -> 3504.13s]  Sonic Boom actually finally got
[3504.13s -> 3506.13s]  The nerf it deserved
[3506.13s -> 3508.13s]  It's now under 8 seconds for a cooldown
[3508.13s -> 3510.13s]  And they fixed a couple of crashes
[3510.13s -> 3512.13s]  The desktop launcher, the crash on exit
[3512.13s -> 3514.13s]  Thank god we can now not have to deal with that
[3514.13s -> 3516.13s]  It's true
[3518.37s -> 3520.37s]  No look
[3520.37s -> 3522.37s]  There's no reason for you to go this fast
[3522.37s -> 3524.37s]  Okay I'm just going to be very frank with you
[3524.37s -> 3526.37s]  Take your finger off that button right now
[3526.37s -> 3528.37s]  Right now, if you have any respect
[3528.37s -> 3530.61s]  Why is Dark Souls 2 even on here?
[3530.61s -> 3532.61s]  Why is Dark Souls 2 even on here?
[3532.61s -> 3534.61s]  I'm just going to hang out
[3534.61s -> 3536.61s]  I'll be over here on my phone
[3536.61s -> 3538.61s]  Got a couple new apps to check out
[3538.61s -> 3540.61s]  I downloaded Face Swap
[3540.61s -> 3542.61s]  You can do it with your dog
[3542.61s -> 3544.61s]  I got a new keyboard app too
[3544.61s -> 3546.61s]  I'm not sure if you've heard of it
[3546.61s -> 3548.61s]  It's called Key
[3548.61s -> 3550.61s]  You can make a little tune
[3550.61s -> 3552.61s]  It's pretty cool
[3554.61s -> 3556.61s]  What the hell is this?
[3558.61s -> 3560.61s]  Hold on
[3560.61s -> 3562.61s]  Pause the video for a second
[3562.61s -> 3564.61s]  Pause it
[3564.61s -> 3566.61s]  You're in a different video right now
[3566.61s -> 3568.61s]  I haven't even made this video yet
[3568.61s -> 3570.61s]  You are at least 20 to 30 uploads in the future
[3570.61s -> 3572.61s]  So you're going to listen to me very closely
[3572.61s -> 3574.61s]  and very carefully
[3574.61s -> 3576.61s]  You're going to rewind
[3576.61s -> 3578.61s]  a few months
[3578.61s -> 3580.78s]  and you're going to stop, okay?
[3580.78s -> 3583.60s]  Very simple instruction
[3583.60s -> 3585.60s]  There you go, right here, right here
[3585.60s -> 3587.60s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop
[3587.60s -> 3589.60s]  Stop right here
[3589.60s -> 3591.60s]  I'm overlapping here
[3591.60s -> 3593.60s]  Pull forward like 2 inches or so
[3593.60s -> 3596.16s]  On the bar? Almost there
[3596.16s -> 3598.90s]  One more, got it, perfect
[3598.90s -> 3601.07s]  These are my patch notes
[3601.07s -> 3603.07s]  My dress came out today
[3603.07s -> 3605.31s]  I haven't even seen these yet
[3605.31s -> 3607.31s]  You picked a perfect place to stop
[3607.31s -> 3609.94s]  So let's see what they changed
[3609.94s -> 3611.94s]  They're actually shrinking me again
[3611.94s -> 3613.94s]  This is the second time it's happened
[3613.94s -> 3615.94s]  We should only feel that Jerma's current height
[3615.94s -> 3617.94s]  has been causing performance issues
[3617.94s -> 3619.94s]  He couldn't easily fit into a clown car
[3619.94s -> 3622.56s]  With this change, clown car videos are now much more accessible
[3622.56s -> 3624.56s]  I don't want to do clown car videos
[3624.56s -> 3626.56s]  What are they talking about?
[3626.56s -> 3628.56s]  My lumberjack outfit is going to get removed too
[3628.56s -> 3630.56s]  Now that is bullshit
[3630.56s -> 3632.93s]  What else do we got?
[3632.93s -> 3635.74s]  This patch is fucking terrible so far
[3635.74s -> 3637.74s]  40% more vacation vlogs
[3637.74s -> 3640.80s]  No, I'm not doing vacation videos
[3640.80s -> 3643.42s]  No way
[3643.42s -> 3645.42s]  I would rather do 100 clown car videos
[3645.42s -> 3647.42s]  than one vacation video
[3647.42s -> 3649.42s]  So, opting out of this one
[3649.42s -> 3651.42s]  As you could say
[3651.42s -> 3653.98s]  It's downloading
[3653.98s -> 3655.98s]  When did I do that? I didn't press any button
[3655.98s -> 3658.16s]  I didn't accept anything, there was no cancel or anything
[3658.16s -> 3660.16s]  Nothing's working here
[3660.16s -> 3662.16s]  Do I seriously have to rip out my ethernet cable?
[3662.16s -> 3664.16s]  I do, I don't want this patch
[3664.16s -> 3667.47s]  Hold on a second
[3667.47s -> 3669.47s]  I had all these installed
[3669.47s -> 3672.29s]  I'm connected to my whole damn house
[3672.29s -> 3675.73s]  I think that's it, is it?
[3675.73s -> 3677.73s]  God damn it
[3677.73s -> 3679.97s]  Ow, ow
[3679.97s -> 3682.34s]  That's the cable
[3682.34s -> 3684.34s]  I gotta put that back in, I want to watch Better Call Saul season 2
[3684.34s -> 3686.96s]  I can't jack out
[3686.96s -> 3689.39s]  Hello
[3689.39s -> 3692.66s]  You are going to have to call back
[3692.66s -> 3694.90s]  at a different time
[3694.90s -> 3697.20s]  I'm in the middle of some shit right now
[3697.20s -> 3699.20s]  Look, please put me on the do not call list
[3699.20s -> 3704.56s]  Fucking asshole
[3707.06s -> 3709.06s]  That's not it
[3709.06s -> 3711.55s]  I think I might throw up, I hope not
[3711.55s -> 3713.55s]  What is this? What is that?
[3713.55s -> 3716.18s]  Why do I have a sneeze switch?
[3721.12s -> 3723.12s]  This is it, right here
[3723.12s -> 3725.12s]  Whoa, colors
[3725.12s -> 3727.47s]  Gone
[3727.47s -> 3729.90s]  I can't see anything, I'm blind
[3729.90s -> 3732.34s]  I must have pulled out the HDMI
[3732.34s -> 3734.58s]  Oh boy, oh boy
[3734.58s -> 3736.58s]  Where's my mom? Where's my phone?
[3736.58s -> 3738.58s]  Mom? Fuck
[3738.58s -> 3740.58s]  Where is it? I got it
[3740.58s -> 3742.58s]  How much time do I have? I don't know, I can't tell
[3742.58s -> 3745.65s]  I can't see
[3753.07s -> 3756.53s]  It's actually scary
[3756.53s -> 3759.15s]  This is a weird feeling
[3759.15s -> 3761.46s]  I hide this feeling
[3761.46s -> 3765.42s]  I can't hear, I can't see
[3765.42s -> 3773.10s]  Is there a way?
[3773.10s -> 3775.10s]  I'm coming
[3775.10s -> 3777.10s]  One, two, three
[3785.66s -> 3794.74s]  No
[3794.74s -> 3796.74s]  It happened
[3796.74s -> 3801.09s]  And that was the last video
[3801.09s -> 3803.33s]  I ever made, besides
[3803.33s -> 3807.42s]  Germa Ripple Live, interesting
[3807.42s -> 3816.96s]  We got the bad ending
[3816.96s -> 3818.96s]  on Germa985 apparently
[3818.96s -> 3822.67s]  Door Cube? Alright
[3822.67s -> 3824.67s]  Funny thing about Door Cube
[3824.67s -> 3826.67s]  Door Cube is claimed right now
[3826.67s -> 3829.36s]  This video, apparently I don't
[3829.36s -> 3832.11s]  own it anymore
[3832.11s -> 3837.79s]  I don't know why
[3837.79s -> 3839.79s]  This video has been like demonetized
[3839.79s -> 3841.79s]  and DMCA'd by I don't know what
[3841.79s -> 3843.79s]  I think maybe the ending sequence
[3843.79s -> 3847.89s]  but I paid for that
[3847.89s -> 3849.89s]  I couldn't figure it out because all the things were like legally
[3849.89s -> 3856.22s]  obtained
[3856.22s -> 3858.22s]  I'll give some context, people that don't know
[3858.22s -> 3860.22s]  about this
[3860.22s -> 3862.22s]  So, somewhere in
[3862.22s -> 3864.22s]  like 2012
[3864.22s -> 3866.22s]  I'm gonna get bigger for this
[3866.22s -> 3868.22s]  Somewhere in like 2012
[3868.22s -> 3870.22s]  to like 2016
[3870.22s -> 3872.22s]  There was like a
[3872.22s -> 3874.22s]  As of like two or three years ago
[3874.22s -> 3876.22s]  There was this craze of
[3876.22s -> 3878.22s]  opening loot boxes on camera
[3878.22s -> 3880.22s]  There was like loot crate
[3880.22s -> 3882.22s]  and
[3882.22s -> 3884.22s]  They all had the same fucking name
[3884.22s -> 3886.22s]  There was like
[3886.22s -> 3889.10s]  2014
[3889.10s -> 3891.10s]  Yeah, but this trickled all the way into like
[3891.10s -> 3893.10s]  late 2015 too, I remember
[3895.47s -> 3897.47s]  There was like five of them
[3897.47s -> 3899.47s]  And tons of people
[3899.47s -> 3901.47s]  tons of like YouTubers and streamers
[3901.47s -> 3903.47s]  were like doing
[3903.47s -> 3905.47s]  sponsorships for these
[3905.47s -> 3909.04s]  And I kind of
[3909.04s -> 3911.04s]  I guess this is just
[3911.04s -> 3913.66s]  how I felt about it
[3913.66s -> 3925.62s]  in a way
[3925.62s -> 3928.56s]  Loot box
[3928.56s -> 3930.56s]  Yeah, it's weird because we went from like
[3930.56s -> 3932.56s]  opening loot boxes to like then opening
[3932.56s -> 3934.56s]  loot boxes to then opening loot boxes
[3934.56s -> 3936.56s]  in real life
[3936.56s -> 3939.44s]  in games
[3939.44s -> 3941.44s]  Everyone was trying to jump on this craze of
[3941.44s -> 3943.62s]  gambling for Mega Man t-shirts
[3943.62s -> 3945.62s]  You know what I mean? Like
[3945.62s -> 3948.88s]  Oh, by the way, funny thing about this video
[3948.88s -> 3950.88s]  At the very end, I was gonna pull out a Mega Man
[3950.88s -> 3952.88s]  sticker and go
[3952.88s -> 3954.88s]  Mega Man! Mega Man sticker!
[3954.88s -> 3956.88s]  But I never did it
[3956.88s -> 3958.88s]  I feel like that would be too obvious
[3958.88s -> 3961.82s]  So, let's go
[3961.82s -> 3966.50s]  Here comes Dork Cube
[3966.50s -> 3975.25s]  Let's see what happens in this video
[3975.25s -> 3977.25s]  Hey, what's happening everybody?
[3977.25s -> 3979.25s]  Jirba here with something a little
[3979.25s -> 3981.25s]  different today. This is not my
[3981.25s -> 3983.42s]  typical video that I would make
[3983.42s -> 3985.42s]  But I decided to do it
[3985.42s -> 3987.42s]  because I'm approached by this company
[3987.42s -> 3989.42s]  There's a super cool bunch of guys
[3989.42s -> 3991.42s]  over at Dork Cube and it is
[3991.42s -> 3993.42s]  The Dork Cube! Take a look at it
[3993.42s -> 3995.42s]  This is a monthly subscription box
[3995.42s -> 3997.42s]  that comes in the mail
[3997.42s -> 3999.42s]  And you buy it, you open it, and there's all
[3999.42s -> 4001.42s]  kinds of nerdy
[4001.42s -> 4003.42s]  geeky, epic, kind of funny
[4003.42s -> 4005.42s]  gamer culture type stuff inside
[4005.42s -> 4007.42s]  And I thought
[4007.42s -> 4009.42s]  I should get one and I should open it for you
[4009.42s -> 4011.42s]  Give these guys a shout, give these guys a shout out
[4011.42s -> 4013.42s]  and give you guys a shout out
[4013.42s -> 4015.42s]  and we'll give them a shout out. This is Dork Cube!
[4015.42s -> 4017.42s]  I don't know what's inside of it
[4017.42s -> 4019.42s]  I have no idea, they sent it to me, so we're gonna see
[4019.42s -> 4021.42s]  what's inside
[4021.42s -> 4023.42s]  A link will be in the description
[4023.42s -> 4025.42s]  If you want 2% off your next
[4025.42s -> 4027.42s]  order, it's $20
[4027.42s -> 4029.42s]  So, save a little bit of cash
[4029.42s -> 4031.42s]  Look it up for you guys, you know what I mean?
[4031.42s -> 4035.14s]  Alright, let's make this a little interesting
[4035.14s -> 4037.31s]  How about that? Write when the box
[4037.31s -> 4039.31s]  opens. How about everybody writes
[4039.31s -> 4041.31s]  the hashtag in the comments
[4041.31s -> 4043.31s]  LUTEGAP, you know what I mean? Like we got LUTE
[4043.31s -> 4045.31s]  That's what we'll do
[4045.31s -> 4047.31s]  So in the comment section below, right when this opens
[4047.31s -> 4049.31s]  everybody say
[4049.31s -> 4051.31s]  LUTEGAP!
[4051.31s -> 4053.87s]  There's blood in the box! There's blood inside
[4053.87s -> 4058.80s]  this box! This blood!
[4058.80s -> 4061.36s]  The box was blood! The box was just blood!
[4061.36s -> 4071.28s]  This video, I no
[4071.28s -> 4073.28s]  longer own this video, it was claimed
[4073.28s -> 4077.31s]  Is that the Dr. Phil song?
[4077.31s -> 4079.31s]  Is it the Dr. Phil song?
[4079.31s -> 4083.02s]  The box was just blood!
[4083.02s -> 4088.14s]  It is, isn't it?
[4088.14s -> 4090.14s]  No, no, no, no. This is like a royalty free song
[4090.14s -> 4094.50s]  Who claimed this video?
[4094.50s -> 4097.38s]  It was for the song
[4097.38s -> 4105.95s]  Wait a minute
[4105.95s -> 4114.96s]  That's not it, right?
[4114.96s -> 4117.52s]  I did not get claimed
[4117.52s -> 4128.85s]  by Dr. Phil
[4128.85s -> 4135.57s]  The box was blood!
[4135.57s -> 4143.63s]  The box was just blood!
[4143.63s -> 4146.58s]  That's not the same song
[4146.58s -> 4148.58s]  One of them is like a shitty pretend rip off
[4148.58s -> 4152.22s]  of the other one, I think
[4152.22s -> 4154.22s]  No, it wasn't Dr. Phil
[4154.22s -> 4157.10s]  But yeah
[4157.10s -> 4164.27s]  That was Dorku
[4164.27s -> 4166.27s]  The sound it makes?
[4166.27s -> 4168.96s]  Oh god
[4168.96s -> 4173.82s]  Do we have to fucking listen to this video?
[4173.82s -> 4175.82s]  The sound it makes!
[4175.82s -> 4179.92s]  No!
[4179.92s -> 4184.46s]  Oh god
[4184.46s -> 4186.46s]  I fucking forgot about this video
[4186.46s -> 4188.64s]  This video is so
[4188.64s -> 4197.28s]  meaningless
[4197.28s -> 4199.28s]  This was like the state of making a TF2 video
[4199.28s -> 4201.28s]  after making like 200 of them
[4201.28s -> 4209.28s]  Alright, here we go
[4209.28s -> 4211.28s]  It's called The Sound It Makes
[4211.28s -> 4218.30s]  Okay
[4218.30s -> 4220.30s]  Alright, hey
[4220.30s -> 4222.30s]  Welcome, thank you
[4222.30s -> 4224.30s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the new
[4224.30s -> 4226.30s]  Settle down, settle down, okay, thank you very much
[4226.30s -> 4228.30s]  Welcome to the new series
[4228.30s -> 4230.30s]  here on German 985
[4230.30s -> 4232.30s]  It is a game show titled
[4232.30s -> 4234.30s]  What's the TF2 Sound?
[4234.30s -> 4236.30s]  So we're gonna go ahead and invite
[4236.30s -> 4238.30s]  our first ever contestant, Star Underscore
[4238.30s -> 4240.30s]  Welcome to the show, Star
[4240.30s -> 4242.30s]  Hello, what were you doing today?
[4242.30s -> 4244.30s]  I was away from Kentucky to be here on this
[4244.30s -> 4246.30s]  Alright, yeah, okay, so here we go
[4246.30s -> 4248.30s]  You're gonna have to guess the TF2 sound
[4248.30s -> 4250.30s]  Can you get it right? Here we go
[4250.30s -> 4255.87s]  That's the scout, that's the scout
[4255.87s -> 4258.88s]  What is the TF2 sound?
[4258.88s -> 4261.57s]  That was just you
[4261.57s -> 4263.57s]  I thought you were gonna get like an actual sound clip
[4263.57s -> 4266.58s]  What was it?
[4266.58s -> 4268.58s]  I don't know, what is that sound?
[4268.58s -> 4270.58s]  You don't know what that is?
[4270.58s -> 4272.58s]  No, I don't know what that is
[4272.58s -> 4274.58s]  Cut it, cut the music
[4274.58s -> 4276.58s]  No, it was the Mini-Sentry
[4276.58s -> 4278.58s]  That's not what it sounds like
[4278.58s -> 4280.58s]  Now you see, I disagree
[4280.58s -> 4282.58s]  But not gonna start an argument about this
[4282.58s -> 4284.58s]  That's not the sound it makes
[4284.58s -> 4286.58s]  That is the sound it makes
[4286.58s -> 4288.58s]  It doesn't go...
[4288.58s -> 4290.58s]  I'm gonna put it to you right now, you wanna hear?
[4290.58s -> 4292.58s]  You wanna hear, are you listening?
[4292.58s -> 4294.58s]  You wanna hear the sound it makes?
[4294.58s -> 4296.58s]  No
[4296.58s -> 4298.58s]  Well, it's set up time, so you're gonna have to just wait a second
[4298.58s -> 4301.82s]  Okay
[4301.82s -> 4304.64s]  Watch out for the spy, watch out for that spy
[4304.64s -> 4306.64s]  I tried to warn him through voice communication and he didn't hear me
[4306.64s -> 4308.64s]  Alright, where are you?
[4308.64s -> 4310.64s]  I'm fucking dead
[4310.64s -> 4312.64s]  Oh, you died?
[4312.64s -> 4314.64s]  Well, you're about to get proven
[4314.64s -> 4316.64s]  Are you ready to get proved wrong?
[4316.64s -> 4318.64s]  I'm ready to get proven
[4318.64s -> 4320.64s]  Here we go
[4320.64s -> 4322.64s]  You're not with me, oh, you're the healer
[4322.64s -> 4324.64s]  I'm the healer
[4324.64s -> 4326.64s]  Take a listen, it's gonna start here in a second
[4326.64s -> 4328.64s]  No, it's not, he blew it up
[4328.64s -> 4330.88s]  He's ubered, run
[4330.88s -> 4333.70s]  Just run away
[4333.70s -> 4335.70s]  Now is the moment of truth
[4335.70s -> 4337.70s]  This is the 20th century sound
[4337.70s -> 4339.70s]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we go
[4339.70s -> 4341.70s]  I don't believe
[4341.70s -> 4343.70s]  I think you're delaying, I think you're doing this on purpose
[4343.70s -> 4345.70s]  No, I'm just going back to the medicine cabinet
[4345.70s -> 4347.70s]  to get some aspirin
[4347.70s -> 4349.70s]  and let's go
[4349.70s -> 4351.70s]  Okay, I'm following you everywhere
[4351.70s -> 4354.83s]  I'm the healer
[4354.83s -> 4356.83s]  Time to hear the sound once and for all
[4356.83s -> 4358.83s]  I got a pack of sand
[4361.52s -> 4363.52s]  I feel like this video is going to be 90% built up
[4363.52s -> 4365.52s]  Can we please make this
[4365.52s -> 4367.52s]  thing
[4367.52s -> 4369.52s]  Alright, kill me
[4369.52s -> 4371.52s]  It's always a soldier
[4371.52s -> 4373.82s]  Kill me
[4373.82s -> 4375.82s]  Okay, I'm gonna put it down right here
[4375.82s -> 4377.82s]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we go
[4377.82s -> 4379.82s]  Time to hear the sound
[4379.82s -> 4381.82s]  We're gonna hear that this is not the sound
[4381.82s -> 4383.82s]  Listen to the sentry right now
[4383.82s -> 4389.52s]  Somebody just gave 10 community subs
[4389.52s -> 4391.52s]  But first of all, let me just say
[4391.52s -> 4393.52s]  I really appreciate the lawnmower being
[4393.52s -> 4396.08s]  started in my left ear over here
[4396.08s -> 4399.15s]  Anywho, that was
[4399.15s -> 4401.15s]  Soup, you just gave 10 community subs
[4401.15s -> 4404.29s]  Thank you for the subs, really appreciate it
[4404.29s -> 4406.91s]  That just threw me off
[4406.91s -> 4411.33s]  My head hurts
[4411.33s -> 4413.33s]  But thank you, Soup
[4413.33s -> 4415.33s]  Really appreciate it
[4415.33s -> 4417.82s]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we go
[4417.82s -> 4419.82s]  Time to hear the sound
[4419.82s -> 4421.82s]  Here we go eventually, we're gonna hear that this is not the sound
[4421.82s -> 4423.82s]  Listen to the sentry right now
[4423.82s -> 4425.82s]  It's just going beep beep
[4425.82s -> 4427.82s]  It beeps like one
[4427.82s -> 4429.82s]  No, it goes
[4429.82s -> 4432.45s]  See, you're gonna hear it double
[4432.45s -> 4434.45s]  I'm gonna hear a lot of it
[4434.45s -> 4436.45s]  He's gonna rancho relaxo all over this
[4436.45s -> 4438.45s]  See, right now
[4438.45s -> 4440.45s]  Listen carefully
[4440.45s -> 4442.45s]  No, now no one's going to come over here
[4442.45s -> 4444.62s]  Just wait
[4444.62s -> 4447.95s]  Somebody will come through the door
[4447.95s -> 4449.95s]  Going up the right side
[4449.95s -> 4451.95s]  I'm currently moving up the right side
[4451.95s -> 4453.95s]  Just put it in this corner, just put it in that corner
[4453.95s -> 4455.95s]  And someone will come out eventually
[4455.95s -> 4457.95s]  No, not that fucking corner
[4457.95s -> 4459.95s]  They're gonna come out the door and just see it
[4459.95s -> 4461.95s]  Which corner? This corner?
[4461.95s -> 4463.95s]  Alright, it's very sneaky
[4463.95s -> 4465.95s]  Okay, now we just need to wait and hear the sound
[4465.95s -> 4467.95s]  Yeah, and we're gonna see who's right and who's wrong
[4467.95s -> 4469.95s]  I think it goes
[4469.95s -> 4472.19s]  And you don't think so
[4472.19s -> 4474.19s]  I don't think so
[4474.19s -> 4476.19s]  This scout, this scout's gonna get d-d-d-d-d
[4476.19s -> 4478.19s]  But not, that doesn't
[4478.19s -> 4480.19s]  I would love for him to walk out here
[4480.19s -> 4483.95s]  Will you just walk out here?
[4483.95s -> 4487.60s]  He's gonna do this forever
[4487.60s -> 4489.60s]  He's gone
[4489.60s -> 4491.60s]  See, listen
[4491.60s -> 4493.60s]  Did you hear that?
[4493.60s -> 4495.60s]  You heard it, didn't you?
[4495.60s -> 4497.60s]  No, no, no, no, no, it never did that before
[4497.60s -> 4499.60s]  Why is it doing that now?
[4499.60s -> 4502.93s]  It's doing it
[4502.93s -> 4504.93s]  It's not doing it
[4504.93s -> 4506.93s]  You can't have my bananas, I just bought them
[4506.93s -> 4508.93s]  Those are my bananas, I'm taking them from you
[4508.93s -> 4510.93s]  I'm gonna have to wash my dishes again
[4510.93s -> 4512.93s]  Look at all these d-d-d-d's I'm getting
[4512.93s -> 4517.66s]  Oh, you think it's gonna work?
[4517.66s -> 4520.67s]  I forgot that
[4520.67s -> 4522.67s]  What is going on in here?
[4522.67s -> 4524.67s]  It's me, I'm the medic
[4524.67s -> 4526.67s]  I'm the medic
[4526.67s -> 4529.36s]  Oh, you're this medic
[4529.36s -> 4533.36s]  Things in your brain just don't add up right away, do they?
[4533.36s -> 4535.36s]  No
[4535.36s -> 4537.36s]  Hey, I'm this medic
[4537.36s -> 4539.36s]  Oh, you're this medic
[4539.36s -> 4544.10s]  Alright, well, for the second part of this video
[4544.10s -> 4546.10s]  That's our s- just bye
[4546.10s -> 4548.10s]  For the second part of this video, I need you to be on my team
[4548.10s -> 4550.10s]  Okay
[4550.10s -> 4552.10s]  This is part two
[4552.10s -> 4554.10s]  This is part two of sounds
[4554.10s -> 4558.24s]  What's- how do they make them?
[4558.24s -> 4560.24s]  So, for part two
[4560.24s -> 4562.24s]  Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet
[4562.24s -> 4564.24s]  What sound is that in the game TF2?
[4564.24s -> 4566.24s]  Uh, that is no sound in TF2
[4566.24s -> 4568.24s]  You just screamed for like 12 seconds
[4568.24s -> 4570.24s]  Oh, that's not a sound, that's you
[4570.24s -> 4572.24s]  Great joke, I think I already fucking made it
[4572.24s -> 4574.24s]  No, that sound isn't TF2
[4574.24s -> 4576.24s]  Oh, really? What was that sound?
[4576.24s -> 4578.24s]  It's- you have to guess, you have to figure it out
[4578.24s -> 4580.24s]  So you're telling me there is a sound in TF2
[4580.24s -> 4582.24s]  Mine at least was close
[4582.24s -> 4584.74s]  Yours was not- yours was nothing
[4584.74s -> 4586.74s]  Mine was close enough
[4586.74s -> 4588.74s]  Mine was really fucking close
[4588.74s -> 4591.30s]  No, that sound is part of
[4591.30s -> 4593.30s]  Of this map?
[4593.30s -> 4597.12s]  The ecosystem
[4597.12s -> 4599.12s]  Did I win?
[4599.12s -> 4601.12s]  No, it's a weapon
[4601.12s -> 4603.12s]  We were only doing weapons
[4603.12s -> 4605.12s]  Like you did the weapon slinger
[4605.12s -> 4609.73s]  Do it again for me?
[4609.73s -> 4612.61s]  It's different every time
[4612.61s -> 4615.42s]  Did I get it?
[4615.42s -> 4617.42s]  That is not a sound in TF2
[4617.42s -> 4619.73s]  Yeah, no, it's a gun
[4619.73s -> 4621.73s]  Rocket launcher
[4621.73s -> 4623.73s]  No
[4623.73s -> 4625.73s]  Uh, the
[4625.73s -> 4627.73s]  Scatter gun
[4627.73s -> 4629.73s]  No, no, no, no, no, you're not thinking the right way
[4629.73s -> 4631.73s]  Katana
[4631.73s -> 4633.73s]  What the fuck is it then?
[4633.73s -> 4635.73s]  It's a- some- I mean it doesn't have to kill people
[4635.73s -> 4637.73s]  Huntsman, the huntsman, the huntsman
[4637.73s -> 4639.73s]  That was pretty good
[4639.73s -> 4641.73s]  Lock and load
[4641.73s -> 4643.73s]  Critscreek, critscreek
[4643.73s -> 4645.73s]  Yes, yes, god it was obvious
[4645.73s -> 4647.73s]  How did I not get that?
[4647.73s -> 4649.73s]  I know, it doesn't hurt people, that was the clue
[4649.73s -> 4651.73s]  I know, the hurting starts as good as the hurting starts as good
[4651.73s -> 4653.73s]  The hurting starts as good as the healing starts as good
[4653.73s -> 4655.73s]  What the fuck
[4655.73s -> 4658.10s]  Is wrong with me?
[4658.10s -> 4660.34s]  Well that uh
[4660.34s -> 4662.34s]  That sounds absolutely nothing like what you did
[4662.34s -> 4664.34s]  At all
[4664.34s -> 4666.34s]  No, that's exactly what it is
[4666.34s -> 4668.34s]  The first initial activation
[4668.34s -> 4670.34s]  It starts off like that and it goes down
[4670.34s -> 4672.34s]  Okay, well we got that
[4672.34s -> 4674.34s]  That mystery solved
[4674.34s -> 4676.34s]  I'm gonna go ahead and play some demo night
[4676.34s -> 4679.47s]  For the remainder of the video
[4679.47s -> 4681.47s]  And then end the video
[4681.47s -> 4689.71s]  What a YouTuber
[4689.71s -> 4692.72s]  Pretty good YouTuber
[4692.72s -> 4696.18s]  Alright, what's next?
[4696.18s -> 4699.25s]  My first Dark Souls video
[4699.25s -> 4701.74s]  Holy shit
[4701.74s -> 4703.74s]  This is- oh yeah, this is great
[4703.74s -> 4706.24s]  What a great idea
[4706.24s -> 4711.04s]  The best part about this video is I had no idea
[4711.04s -> 4713.04s]  How to play Dark Souls at all
[4713.04s -> 4717.01s]  I was one of those people that
[4717.01s -> 4719.38s]  Just started to play it
[4719.38s -> 4721.38s]  Because it was a new
[4721.38s -> 4723.38s]  Game that came out
[4723.38s -> 4725.38s]  I didn't understand anything about it
[4725.38s -> 4727.38s]  I didn't get it at all
[4727.38s -> 4730.77s]  I thought the game sucked
[4730.77s -> 4732.77s]  I thought it was a shitty game
[4732.77s -> 4734.77s]  I was like this is a dumb game
[4734.77s -> 4737.33s]  Like it's crappy
[4737.33s -> 4740.14s]  I didn't get it
[4740.14s -> 4742.14s]  I really didn't- I didn't get it at all
[4742.14s -> 4745.41s]  And we're gonna find out why
[4745.41s -> 4747.41s]  This is a buried video I think somewhere
[4747.41s -> 4750.99s]  Does anybody have the link to that one?
[4750.99s -> 4758.54s]  Because this is old
[4758.54s -> 4760.54s]  I'm not sure how many people have even seen this video
[4760.54s -> 4762.54s]  I can't even find it
[4762.54s -> 4764.54s]  Oh man, oh man, this is gonna be bad
[4764.54s -> 4768.38s]  Oh
[4768.38s -> 4773.30s]  Fuck
[4773.30s -> 4775.30s]  Hold on
[4775.30s -> 4777.30s]  I wanna show the image of this on screen
[4777.30s -> 4793.28s]  Don't- nobody click it, don't click it
[4793.28s -> 4796.42s]  Hold on a second
[4796.42s -> 4798.42s]  Here is the thumbnail for this video
[4798.42s -> 4800.85s]  I am not ready for this
[4800.85s -> 4808.21s]  I really am not
[4808.21s -> 4821.90s]  What am I clicking on this for?
[4821.90s -> 4823.90s]  This video is like in 8 and a half minutes
[4823.90s -> 4825.90s]  This is not- this is the-
[4825.90s -> 4831.34s]  I wasn't doing that ironically
[4831.34s -> 4833.34s]  That was me saying like
[4833.34s -> 4837.18s]  And uhh
[4837.18s -> 4839.18s]  How long was this video made?
[4839.18s -> 4846.22s]  Six, seven years ago? Seven years ago
[4846.22s -> 4848.22s]  I'm gonna hate this video
[4848.22s -> 4850.22s]  This is gonna be like Modern Warfare 3
[4850.22s -> 4857.52s]  Tier of video I think
[4857.52s -> 4859.52s]  And it's the title of this video
[4859.52s -> 4861.82s]  Why is the title this?
[4861.82s -> 4863.82s]  Look at the title of this fucking video
[4863.82s -> 4865.82s]  Hold on, what is wrong with me?
[4865.82s -> 4868.90s]  Why is this the title?
[4868.90s -> 4879.78s]  The title of this video
[4879.78s -> 4881.78s]  Is Dark Souls
[4881.78s -> 4883.78s]  Prepare to Die Edition
[4883.78s -> 4885.78s]  In brackets
[4885.78s -> 4887.78s]  Ha ha dot dot dot
[4887.78s -> 4889.78s]  Oh god
[4889.78s -> 4893.30s]  Dash uncensored germa
[4893.30s -> 4896.18s]  End bracket
[4896.18s -> 4898.18s]  Just in case you were curious
[4902.98s -> 4904.98s]  Now it would be funny
[4904.98s -> 4906.98s]  If this video was playing
[4906.98s -> 4908.98s]  And then I like fucking
[4908.98s -> 4910.98s]  No nevermind, I was gonna say like
[4910.98s -> 4914.62s]  I'm like get halfway through the video
[4914.62s -> 4916.62s]  Oh hey by the way it's uncensored
[4916.62s -> 4925.90s]  Ha ha oh god
[4925.90s -> 4931.15s]  I don't know if I wanna watch this
[4931.15s -> 4933.15s]  Ha ha oh god, uncensored germa
[4933.15s -> 4935.15s]  This is a fucking video from a long time ago
[4935.15s -> 4937.15s]  Okay let's go
[4937.15s -> 4939.15s]  Let's do it
[4939.15s -> 4941.15s]  I just clicked it
[4946.13s -> 4948.82s]  Wait but remember
[4948.82s -> 4950.82s]  This is important, I need to
[4950.82s -> 4952.82s]  I didn't know anything about this game
[4952.82s -> 4954.82s]  It wasn't like oh you know
[4954.82s -> 4956.82s]  I can't, whatever
[4956.82s -> 4958.82s]  Hey what is going on everybody
[4958.82s -> 4960.82s]  Welcome to Dark Souls
[4960.82s -> 4962.82s]  Die
[4962.82s -> 4964.82s]  Alright it's not bad
[4966.82s -> 4968.82s]  Dog
[4968.82s -> 4970.82s]  Alright let's make this guy
[4970.82s -> 4975.41s]  Class
[4975.41s -> 4983.65s]  Did you hear the dog
[4983.65s -> 4986.02s]  Alright let's make this guy
[4986.02s -> 4988.02s]  Class
[4988.02s -> 4990.02s]  Warrior, knight
[4990.02s -> 4992.02s]  They all have different stats
[4992.02s -> 4994.02s]  I probably should be looking at that
[4994.02s -> 4996.02s]  You know whatever, hunter
[4996.02s -> 4998.02s]  Sorcerer, pyromancer
[4998.02s -> 5000.02s]  Cleric
[5000.02s -> 5002.90s]  Oh he's naked
[5002.90s -> 5005.39s]  What
[5005.39s -> 5007.39s]  Hold on, all these guys have like armor
[5007.39s -> 5009.39s]  And like clothing and stuff, why does this guy only have like
[5009.39s -> 5011.39s]  Underwear on
[5011.39s -> 5013.39s]  What the hell is this guy
[5013.39s -> 5015.39s]  Alright we'll go with this guy
[5015.39s -> 5017.39s]  The worst possible thing I could do
[5017.39s -> 5019.39s]  I'm gonna get my ass kicked
[5019.39s -> 5021.39s]  But like the funny joke and I don't even know how to play
[5021.39s -> 5024.98s]  Alright
[5024.98s -> 5026.98s]  Good thing I look like a dipshit
[5026.98s -> 5031.01s]  I'm happy about this
[5031.01s -> 5033.38s]  Oh my word
[5033.38s -> 5035.38s]  Is there anything else I can do
[5035.38s -> 5037.81s]  This is a two video
[5037.81s -> 5040.86s]  This guy looks like a fucking idiot
[5040.86s -> 5042.86s]  Tuber hair
[5042.86s -> 5046.56s]  Hey, what's up man
[5046.56s -> 5048.80s]  How's that wall looking
[5048.80s -> 5051.86s]  Looking good enough for this
[5051.86s -> 5053.86s]  Dark Souls is
[5053.86s -> 5057.44s]  So hard
[5057.44s -> 5059.44s]  Left stick and hold that, alright like that
[5059.44s -> 5061.44s]  I don't even know what that is
[5061.44s -> 5063.44s]  Eye frames, I just think it's a fucking
[5063.44s -> 5066.38s]  Action game
[5066.38s -> 5068.38s]  Rock release
[5068.38s -> 5072.61s]  Alright
[5072.61s -> 5075.81s]  Hey buddy, so that's a weak attack
[5075.81s -> 5077.81s]  This is a strong attack
[5077.81s -> 5079.81s]  Good to go
[5079.81s -> 5082.43s]  What am I using for a weapon, what is this
[5082.43s -> 5084.43s]  Am I using like a popsicle stick for a sword
[5084.43s -> 5086.67s]  Pretty funny
[5086.67s -> 5088.91s]  Pretty funny
[5088.91s -> 5092.30s]  What's for dinner, are we gonna have lobsters
[5092.30s -> 5095.36s]  Tonight
[5095.36s -> 5097.36s]  Read the message
[5097.36s -> 5099.36s]  Oh my god
[5099.36s -> 5101.36s]  That's a big boy
[5101.36s -> 5103.36s]  I wouldn't stand here and like watch him while he smashes you
[5103.36s -> 5105.36s]  What is this, Mag Veradon
[5105.36s -> 5107.36s]  From Warcraft
[5107.36s -> 5109.36s]  Holy shit, that's a good reference
[5109.36s -> 5111.36s]  Whoa
[5111.36s -> 5113.36s]  This is Mag Veradon from Warcraft
[5113.36s -> 5115.36s]  This is Mag Veradon
[5115.36s -> 5117.36s]  From Warcraft
[5117.36s -> 5119.36s]  I gotta get the hell out of here
[5119.36s -> 5121.36s]  Do I have to fight him
[5121.36s -> 5123.36s]  I don't know, just go, run this way
[5123.36s -> 5125.36s]  No, not this way, what am I doing
[5125.36s -> 5127.36s]  Oh my god, I'm an idiot
[5127.36s -> 5129.36s]  Oh an exit
[5129.36s -> 5131.36s]  Woohoo
[5131.36s -> 5133.73s]  Yeah, what you got on me
[5133.73s -> 5135.73s]  Do I have to watch the whole video
[5135.73s -> 5137.90s]  I'm gonna delete this video when it's over
[5137.90s -> 5139.90s]  I'm gonna delete this video
[5139.90s -> 5141.90s]  This video is getting deleted
[5141.90s -> 5150.14s]  Ouch
[5150.14s -> 5152.14s]  This video is getting deleted
[5152.14s -> 5154.14s]  Alright, first hold on a minute
[5154.14s -> 5156.14s]  This is important, I gotta step in and give you some commentary here
[5156.14s -> 5158.14s]  Listen to me, this is important
[5158.14s -> 5160.14s]  You know
[5160.14s -> 5162.14s]  I've made like a thousand videos
[5162.14s -> 5164.14s]  And maybe like 800
[5164.14s -> 5166.14s]  I like this video, this video is fun
[5166.14s -> 5168.14s]  Download it quick
[5168.14s -> 5171.09s]  Get it quick
[5171.09s -> 5173.09s]  I like this video
[5173.09s -> 5175.09s]  And it was at a time when YouTube was very young
[5175.09s -> 5177.09s]  And you had to do something fun
[5177.09s -> 5179.09s]  And different
[5179.09s -> 5181.09s]  And playing Dark Souls and going out
[5181.09s -> 5183.09s]  Was different to me
[5183.09s -> 5187.76s]  I like this video
[5187.76s -> 5190.06s]  Because it was like
[5190.06s -> 5192.06s]  Seven years ago it was me trying to
[5192.06s -> 5194.06s]  Get the YouTube game going
[5194.06s -> 5198.54s]  I was young
[5198.54s -> 5200.54s]  I was like 30
[5200.54s -> 5202.54s]  I was like 27
[5202.54s -> 5204.54s]  I didn't even pay attention to any of that
[5204.54s -> 5206.54s]  I was too busy laughing at my like
[5206.54s -> 5207.54s]  Stupid jump
[5207.54s -> 5210.62s]  Yes, I'll do it, sure
[5210.62s -> 5212.62s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[5216.26s -> 5218.26s]  Yeah, screw your family
[5218.26s -> 5220.26s]  Can I just shut this guy up
[5220.26s -> 5222.26s]  Oh, oh my god
[5222.26s -> 5224.26s]  I didn't think you could kill him
[5224.26s -> 5226.26s]  Oh, oh
[5226.26s -> 5228.26s]  I didn't know you could do that
[5228.26s -> 5230.63s]  I didn't know you could do that
[5231.87s -> 5233.87s]  Was I not supposed to do that
[5233.87s -> 5235.87s]  Uncensored German, what does that even mean
[5235.87s -> 5237.87s]  Sorry
[5237.87s -> 5240.94s]  Wield right weapon, two handed
[5240.94s -> 5242.94s]  This video is almost half way done
[5242.94s -> 5244.94s]  Oh, I can use this as a two hander
[5244.94s -> 5246.94s]  Oh great, yeah, let me use it
[5246.94s -> 5248.94s]  Dude, you know what, seriously
[5248.94s -> 5250.94s]  Get the hell out of here
[5250.94s -> 5252.94s]  I'm fighting in a stupid hallway
[5252.94s -> 5254.94s]  I can't even swing my sword
[5257.31s -> 5259.31s]  Seriously, you are
[5259.31s -> 5261.31s]  So annoying, I should have just gotten rid of you
[5261.31s -> 5264.26s]  But I had the chance
[5264.26s -> 5266.01s]  God
[5266.01s -> 5268.70s]  This is the lamest fight ever
[5268.70s -> 5270.70s]  No, don't kill me
[5270.70s -> 5272.94s]  I'm just gonna go this way, screw you
[5272.94s -> 5274.94s]  Where's the bonfire
[5274.94s -> 5276.94s]  Oh, it revives enemies too
[5276.94s -> 5278.94s]  Oh, shit
[5278.94s -> 5280.94s]  There's the uncensored part
[5280.94s -> 5282.94s]  God, I don't
[5282.94s -> 5284.94s]  No, why can't I attack
[5284.94s -> 5286.94s]  What the fuck is going on
[5286.94s -> 5288.94s]  Oh, get me out of the menu, there we go
[5292.90s -> 5296.62s]  Not gonna be an idiot
[5296.62s -> 5298.62s]  That does so much more damage
[5298.62s -> 5300.62s]  So, remember, this is important to note
[5300.62s -> 5302.62s]  This is very important extra commentary here
[5302.62s -> 5304.92s]  Can you imagine
[5304.92s -> 5307.22s]  Somebody doing this now
[5307.22s -> 5309.22s]  Imagine you went to a
[5309.22s -> 5311.22s]  Twitch stream right now
[5311.22s -> 5313.22s]  Somebody's just playing Dark Souls for the first time
[5313.22s -> 5317.32s]  And this is what they're doing
[5317.32s -> 5320.52s]  You'd be like, what fucking year is it right now
[5320.52s -> 5326.79s]  He never changed
[5326.79s -> 5328.79s]  It's only been like seven years
[5328.79s -> 5331.61s]  It hasn't been that long
[5331.61s -> 5334.68s]  You do this
[5334.68s -> 5336.86s]  I'm talking about in Dark Souls
[5336.86s -> 5339.29s]  If somebody would have played
[5339.29s -> 5341.29s]  Dark Souls now and like walk around
[5341.29s -> 5343.29s]  With the tutorial knife
[5343.29s -> 5345.29s]  And get killed by like the
[5345.29s -> 5347.29s]  Skinless ghouls out here
[5347.29s -> 5349.53s]  Like five times
[5349.53s -> 5353.50s]  Horde or Alliance, Alliance
[5353.50s -> 5355.50s]  Horde to begin with
[5355.50s -> 5361.96s]  And then Alliance
[5361.96s -> 5365.35s]  Literally, what do you mean me
[5365.35s -> 5367.35s]  I did fucking great in the
[5367.35s -> 5376.89s]  Dark Souls games on these streams
[5376.89s -> 5380.02s]  Two weeks ago, what
[5380.02s -> 5382.02s]  Are you guys really trying to compare
[5382.02s -> 5384.52s]  Having random
[5384.52s -> 5386.52s]  Bosses around every
[5386.52s -> 5388.52s]  Corner to starting
[5388.52s -> 5390.52s]  Dark Souls for the first time ever
[5390.52s -> 5393.14s]  In 2013
[5393.14s -> 5398.65s]  Horde, but then
[5398.65s -> 5400.65s]  I went to
[5400.65s -> 5402.65s]  Alliance because my friends played Alliance
[5402.65s -> 5405.21s]  So much better
[5405.21s -> 5407.21s]  This game just became so much easier
[5407.21s -> 5410.47s]  Holy shit, come on
[5410.47s -> 5412.47s]  No
[5412.47s -> 5414.47s]  Holy shit, I can't fucking believe it
[5414.47s -> 5416.47s]  I'm getting chased
[5416.47s -> 5418.47s]  I'm getting chased
[5418.47s -> 5420.47s]  I don't even know what this does but I'm drinking it
[5420.47s -> 5422.47s]  I don't know what this does
[5422.47s -> 5424.47s]  But I'm going to drink it
[5424.47s -> 5427.29s]  What does that even do, I can't even do it
[5427.29s -> 5429.78s]  Get
[5429.78s -> 5431.78s]  Get me while I'm jumping
[5431.78s -> 5433.78s]  I want my shield back
[5433.78s -> 5435.78s]  I like the shield back
[5435.78s -> 5437.78s]  I wasn't like
[5437.78s -> 5439.78s]  I don't even know
[5439.78s -> 5441.78s]  I'm getting chased
[5441.78s -> 5443.78s]  I don't even know what this does but I'm drinking it
[5443.78s -> 5445.78s]  Holy shit
[5445.78s -> 5450.33s]  What does that even do
[5450.33s -> 5452.33s]  I can't even do it
[5452.33s -> 5454.50s]  The guy that played two weeks ago
[5454.50s -> 5456.50s]  You can't get me while I'm jumping
[5456.50s -> 5458.50s]  I want my shield back
[5458.50s -> 5460.50s]  The guy that doesn't know how to drink an Estus
[5460.50s -> 5462.50s]  Is on the same level as the mod guy two weeks ago
[5462.50s -> 5464.50s]  I wasn't even locking on to enemies
[5464.50s -> 5466.50s]  I was just flailing around
[5466.50s -> 5468.50s]  Holy shit, Tingy just gave 20
[5468.50s -> 5470.50s]  You've given like 150 community subs
[5470.50s -> 5473.26s]  The last week
[5473.26s -> 5476.52s]  Thank you for the 20 community subs, Tingy
[5476.52s -> 5478.52s]  That's a shitload of money
[5478.52s -> 5482.02s]  A shitload more subs
[5482.02s -> 5485.10s]  Thank you, that's a lot
[5485.10s -> 5488.68s]  Who was I talking to when I recorded this
[5488.68s -> 5491.05s]  Nobody
[5491.05s -> 5493.05s]  I was just like this
[5493.05s -> 5495.05s]  Except there was nobody in the chat room
[5495.05s -> 5497.05s]  I just sat there
[5497.05s -> 5500.44s]  I just did it
[5500.44s -> 5502.44s]  Yes, I am stalling and pausing and stopping this video
[5502.44s -> 5505.58s]  Idiot
[5505.58s -> 5507.58s]  Give me my lost power
[5507.58s -> 5509.58s]  And this time
[5509.58s -> 5513.16s]  We're going to do lost power
[5513.16s -> 5515.16s]  This is the end of your parents
[5515.16s -> 5517.16s]  Calling every console you own a Nintendo
[5517.16s -> 5519.16s]  Just to be clear about that
[5519.16s -> 5521.16s]  Fuck guns
[5521.16s -> 5523.16s]  Because it's going to be way much easier that way
[5523.16s -> 5525.16s]  That was a double hit
[5525.16s -> 5527.16s]  You like double cheeseburger hit
[5527.16s -> 5529.46s]  Yeah you do
[5529.46s -> 5531.90s]  That's a klat right there
[5531.90s -> 5533.90s]  Come on, shoot it
[5533.90s -> 5535.90s]  Oh, this video
[5535.90s -> 5539.48s]  How do I delete somebody else's video
[5539.48s -> 5541.48s]  Let's get behind this guy
[5541.48s -> 5543.48s]  That's my video
[5543.48s -> 5546.81s]  Oh, how's your back
[5546.81s -> 5549.18s]  Now this guy
[5549.18s -> 5551.18s]  This guy is dead, alright buddy
[5551.18s -> 5553.18s]  I'm prepared, I played for a little bit
[5553.18s -> 5555.18s]  I know how the game works
[5555.18s -> 5557.78s]  Let's go, yeah
[5557.78s -> 5559.78s]  Get locked on, come on
[5559.78s -> 5561.78s]  Oh, dance baby
[5561.78s -> 5564.22s]  That hurts still, it's alright
[5564.22s -> 5566.97s]  We're good
[5566.97s -> 5570.17s]  You ain't got nothing
[5570.17s -> 5572.41s]  Hey look, I learned how to play the game
[5572.41s -> 5574.41s]  It only took me like 25 minutes
[5574.41s -> 5576.41s]  Bullshit
[5576.41s -> 5578.65s]  That's the biggest lie I've ever said
[5578.65s -> 5580.65s]  Look at this guy
[5580.65s -> 5582.65s]  Holy shit
[5582.65s -> 5584.65s]  Oh my god
[5584.65s -> 5588.04s]  Oh god
[5588.04s -> 5590.04s]  20 minutes
[5590.04s -> 5592.04s]  I was trying to make a joke
[5592.04s -> 5594.04s]  About what he looked like
[5594.04s -> 5596.04s]  Slow bro
[5596.04s -> 5599.24s]  Let's go
[5599.24s -> 5601.24s]  You big ugly bitch
[5601.24s -> 5603.24s]  When does this stop
[5603.24s -> 5605.24s]  Oh lord
[5605.24s -> 5608.36s]  Get smashed
[5608.36s -> 5610.66s]  Whoa
[5610.66s -> 5612.66s]  Is that the same audio clip
[5612.66s -> 5615.42s]  I think it was
[5615.42s -> 5617.66s]  Get smashed
[5617.66s -> 5619.66s]  It is
[5619.66s -> 5621.90s]  Get smashed
[5621.90s -> 5625.16s]  I don't think I was
[5625.16s -> 5627.34s]  I don't think I did that
[5627.34s -> 5632.78s]  No I didn't
[5632.78s -> 5635.14s]  I need two for this, hold on
[5635.14s -> 5639.67s]  Oh lord
[5639.67s -> 5641.98s]  Get smashed
[5641.98s -> 5644.22s]  It's different
[5644.22s -> 5646.22s]  But somehow the same
[5646.22s -> 5648.22s]  Can I break these
[5648.22s -> 5650.22s]  Maybe if he breaks these things I get like
[5650.22s -> 5652.22s]  Items or health or something, oh he's stuck
[5652.22s -> 5654.22s]  Go analyze it
[5654.22s -> 5657.29s]  Get away from me
[5657.29s -> 5659.29s]  Can I punch him in like his bum
[5659.29s -> 5661.59s]  I'll hit him in like his thigh
[5661.59s -> 5663.59s]  Of his leg thigh
[5663.59s -> 5665.59s]  That didn't make any sense, but I'm going to beat him
[5665.59s -> 5667.59s]  Holy shit, I thought he was going to belly flop
[5667.59s -> 5669.59s]  He is going to belly flop
[5669.59s -> 5673.18s]  No, how do I drink these flasks
[5673.18s -> 5675.18s]  How do I drink a damn flask
[5675.18s -> 5677.86s]  Escape
[5677.86s -> 5679.86s]  Dodge through his stomach
[5679.86s -> 5682.94s]  Alright, I need to figure out how to drink this stuff
[5682.94s -> 5684.94s]  Recover lost power, take it
[5684.94s -> 5687.69s]  Is this like a potion
[5687.69s -> 5689.69s]  Like a healing potion
[5689.69s -> 5691.69s]  Where's my shield
[5691.69s -> 5693.93s]  I didn't even have my shield
[5693.93s -> 5696.17s]  No, put it back on
[5696.17s -> 5698.17s]  Hold on, time out
[5698.17s -> 5700.17s]  There is no time out
[5700.17s -> 5706.18s]  You can't pause it
[5706.18s -> 5708.18s]  Get him
[5708.18s -> 5710.18s]  I'm hitting right in his butthole
[5710.18s -> 5712.18s]  Wow, the butthole technique is going to work
[5712.18s -> 5715.00s]  I can't believe
[5715.00s -> 5717.00s]  My butthole technique
[5717.00s -> 5719.00s]  Is going to work
[5719.00s -> 5721.00s]  This is working
[5721.00s -> 5723.00s]  I can't believe it
[5723.00s -> 5726.71s]  Give him the kill
[5726.71s -> 5728.71s]  Yes
[5728.71s -> 5731.40s]  Yeah, victory
[5731.40s -> 5733.40s]  Is achieved
[5733.40s -> 5735.83s]  Yeah
[5735.83s -> 5738.20s]  That was pretty ridiculous
[5738.20s -> 5740.20s]  But yeah
[5740.20s -> 5742.20s]  Muscle man weirdo
[5742.20s -> 5746.23s]  To the rescue
[5746.23s -> 5754.92s]  That's it
[5754.92s -> 5757.10s]  This video has 175,000 views
[5757.10s -> 5760.36s]  You know, I think
[5760.36s -> 5762.36s]  What happened was
[5762.36s -> 5764.36s]  Most of these old, old videos
[5764.36s -> 5766.36s]  Have like 20 to 40,000
[5766.36s -> 5769.05s]  I think
[5769.05s -> 5771.05s]  People found this and they watch it
[5771.05s -> 5773.05s]  And they go holy shit
[5773.05s -> 5783.53s]  What is he doing here
[5783.53s -> 5786.54s]  That was fun
[5786.54s -> 5789.99s]  For somebody not knowing
[5789.99s -> 5792.74s]  How to drink an Estus
[5792.74s -> 5794.74s]  This is a Dark Souls video
[5794.74s -> 5796.74s]  This is an edited video
[5796.74s -> 5798.74s]  By the way
[5798.74s -> 5800.74s]  Of somebody that does not understand
[5800.74s -> 5802.74s]  Until the end of the video
[5802.74s -> 5804.74s]  And they still don't know how to do it by the end
[5804.74s -> 5809.86s]  How to drink the healing mechanic
[5809.86s -> 5812.42s]  But come on, I went like
[5812.42s -> 5814.42s]  Worth it
[5814.42s -> 5823.70s]  I don't delete videos
[5823.70s -> 5825.70s]  It shows growth
[5825.70s -> 5827.70s]  I'm not going to delete it
[5827.70s -> 5835.70s]  I only delete videos
[5835.70s -> 5838.14s]  That I
[5838.14s -> 5841.46s]  Accidentally delete
[5841.46s -> 5843.46s]  I'm not going to clean my channel up
[5843.46s -> 5845.46s]  And delete like 100 videos
[5845.46s -> 5847.46s]  I told you that story
[5847.46s -> 5849.46s]  About that time in history
[5849.46s -> 5851.96s]  When I was like
[5851.96s -> 5853.96s]  How many videos do I have
[5853.96s -> 5855.96s]  I have too many videos that just like suck
[5855.96s -> 5857.96s]  Or are fucked up
[5857.96s -> 5859.96s]  Or like they don't
[5859.96s -> 5861.96s]  I have like streams
[5861.96s -> 5863.96s]  I remember I used to stream on YouTube
[5863.96s -> 5866.39s]  And these whole
[5866.39s -> 5868.39s]  Like trial run
[5868.39s -> 5870.39s]  Two to three hour YouTube streams
[5870.39s -> 5872.57s]  And I was like
[5872.57s -> 5874.57s]  I don't want these on the channel
[5874.57s -> 5877.06s]  I don't want these just sitting here
[5877.06s -> 5886.34s]  So I deleted them
[5886.34s -> 5888.34s]  Watch the Pacman video
[5888.34s -> 5897.11s]  Didn't we watch the Pacman video
[5897.11s -> 5899.11s]  We didn't watch the Pacman video
[5899.11s -> 5901.11s]  Where I'm like
[5901.11s -> 5903.11s]  Sliding down the slide and shit
[5903.11s -> 5911.50s]  Somebody just gave 100 bucks
[5911.50s -> 5921.08s]  Hold on, let me see here
[5921.08s -> 5924.22s]  Who just gave 100 dollars
[5924.22s -> 5926.22s]  That was die335
[5926.22s -> 5928.71s]  Thanks for the 100 bucks die
[5928.71s -> 5930.71s]  100
[5930.71s -> 5932.71s]  And they say just want to thank you for spending so much time with your fellow rats
[5932.71s -> 5934.71s]  Been watching since these
[5934.71s -> 5936.71s]  Videos were first made
[5936.71s -> 5940.30s]  Been around a long time
[5940.30s -> 5942.30s]  You and your videos have helped me through so many tough times
[5942.30s -> 5944.30s]  Thanks a million P.S. Don't delete it
[5944.30s -> 5947.18s]  This is part of your origin story
[5947.18s -> 5951.78s]  I'm not going to delete it, I'm just kidding around
[5951.78s -> 5953.78s]  Thank you though
[5953.78s -> 5958.90s]  That's an incredibly nice thing to say
[5958.90s -> 5960.90s]  Thank you die for the 100 fucking dollars
[5960.90s -> 5962.90s]  And your really really nice message
[5962.90s -> 5967.06s]  That's just a really nice thing to say
[5967.06s -> 5969.06s]  Alright what's next
[5969.06s -> 5971.30s]  Why is the kingpin video gone
[5971.30s -> 5973.30s]  A bunch of videos are gone because
[5973.30s -> 5975.30s]  YouTube used to have a feature where you could just click a box
[5975.30s -> 5977.30s]  And then like just delete videos
[5977.30s -> 5979.30s]  I could just like check, check, check
[5979.30s -> 5981.30s]  And I don't know
[5981.30s -> 5983.30s]  I thought there was something in it or something wrong with it
[5983.30s -> 5986.38s]  I don't know
[5986.38s -> 5988.38s]  I went through and deleted like 80 videos like in 2015
[5988.38s -> 5990.38s]  Or something 2014
[5990.38s -> 5994.02s]  Did we watch the fire watch video
[5994.02s -> 5996.39s]  This is streamers choice
[5996.39s -> 6006.25s]  We didn't watch the fire watch video
[6006.25s -> 6009.32s]  No we haven't seen it
[6009.32s -> 6016.94s]  Alright let's watch this one
[6016.94s -> 6018.94s]  This is another one of my, probably one of my favorite videos
[6018.94s -> 6020.94s]  This is another one of the last videos I made too
[6020.94s -> 6027.40s]  Another butthole technique video
[6027.40s -> 6029.40s]  Technically yes
[6029.40s -> 6032.41s]  But physically no
[6032.41s -> 6035.16s]  You know what I'm saying
[6035.16s -> 6037.16s]  Alright this is called the photos are in
[6037.16s -> 6039.16s]  This is like one of the last 4 or 5 videos I made
[6039.16s -> 6041.85s]  I like this one a lot too
[6041.85s -> 6046.18s]  Let's go ahead and see what happens
[6046.18s -> 6052.52s]  So I just recently beat fire watch
[6052.52s -> 6054.52s]  And I came across a feature that I haven't really seen
[6054.52s -> 6056.52s]  Very many people talk about
[6056.52s -> 6058.82s]  There's a disposable camera in this game
[6058.82s -> 6060.82s]  That allows you to take pictures
[6060.82s -> 6062.82s]  You can take a picture of whatever you want
[6062.82s -> 6064.82s]  It never leaves your inventory
[6064.82s -> 6066.82s]  And you have it throughout the whole game
[6066.82s -> 6068.82s]  But the cool feature is
[6068.82s -> 6070.82s]  They actually ask you if you want to develop
[6070.82s -> 6072.82s]  Those photos and they will
[6072.82s -> 6074.82s]  Mail them to you
[6074.82s -> 6076.82s]  And that's exactly what I did
[6076.82s -> 6078.82s]  They got here today and I kind of want to just go through them with you guys
[6078.82s -> 6080.82s]  Like I thought it would be a really neat idea
[6080.82s -> 6082.82s]  To look at them together and see what I took pictures of
[6082.82s -> 6084.82s]  Now
[6084.82s -> 6087.19s]  It has been a while
[6087.19s -> 6089.19s]  So I don't actually know or remember
[6089.19s -> 6091.37s]  What's on these
[6091.37s -> 6093.37s]  Hey your memories have arrived huh
[6093.37s -> 6095.37s]  That's real cute, photo dome
[6095.37s -> 6098.12s]  Look at that
[6098.12s -> 6100.12s]  Okay let's open them up
[6100.12s -> 6105.37s]  Let's see what we got
[6105.37s -> 6108.31s]  First one is the sky
[6108.31s -> 6112.09s]  Skies can be cool sometimes I guess
[6112.09s -> 6114.52s]  That's a rock
[6114.52s -> 6116.52s]  Pretty interesting growth of a rock
[6116.52s -> 6118.52s]  The way that it was growing out of the ground was pretty cool
[6118.52s -> 6121.98s]  I think that's the inside of a bush
[6121.98s -> 6123.98s]  Yeah that's the inside of a bush
[6123.98s -> 6132.10s]  I think I was trying to take a picture of a
[6132.10s -> 6138.44s]  These are fucking terrible
[6138.44s -> 6140.87s]  Seriously
[6140.87s -> 6143.50s]  Did I take these?
[6143.50s -> 6145.50s]  Somebody had to develop these
[6145.50s -> 6147.50s]  What even is this?
[6147.50s -> 6149.50s]  Is that a thumb print?
[6149.50s -> 6152.63s]  Oh there we go, there's a little selfie there
[6152.63s -> 6154.63s]  Selfie action, sometimes you gotta take one
[6154.63s -> 6158.09s]  Okay
[6158.09s -> 6163.64s]  That's a private one
[6163.64s -> 6165.64s]  That's gonna go in a different pile
[6165.64s -> 6167.64s]  That's gonna go in the privacy pile
[6167.64s -> 6169.64s]  Hey a fence
[6169.64s -> 6171.64s]  Take a look at that, interesting right?
[6171.64s -> 6174.58s]  What am I even taking a picture of?
[6174.58s -> 6176.58s]  That is actually sensor
[6176.58s -> 6178.95s]  Hey there you go
[6178.95s -> 6180.95s]  Got a picture of the toilet
[6180.95s -> 6183.19s]  Oh this one's great, I like this one
[6183.19s -> 6185.19s]  This one's like there was a rock on a stump
[6185.19s -> 6187.19s]  And I thought that's such an interesting rock
[6187.19s -> 6189.19s]  That's so odd
[6189.19s -> 6191.19s]  Why would there be a rock on a stump like that?
[6191.19s -> 6198.68s]  I don't know why
[6198.68s -> 6200.68s]  There's a box up there I guess
[6200.68s -> 6203.11s]  Oh here we go, I remember this tree
[6203.11s -> 6205.11s]  I remember saying to myself
[6205.11s -> 6207.11s]  Man it's got such interesting moss growing on the side
[6207.11s -> 6209.11s]  I gotta get a picture with it
[6209.11s -> 6211.11s]  So there you go, there it is
[6211.11s -> 6217.11s]  Privacy pile
[6217.11s -> 6219.11s]  Do I still have the pictures?
[6219.11s -> 6221.11s]  No, I don't
[6221.11s -> 6226.28s]  What the fuck?
[6226.28s -> 6229.99s]  Who am I?
[6229.99s -> 6238.95s]  I don't know who the fuck this is
[6238.95s -> 6241.51s]  I have no idea
[6241.51s -> 6245.99s]  I've never met this person before in my entire life
[6245.99s -> 6247.99s]  No, I wasn't actually naked
[6247.99s -> 6249.99s]  Rock, good one
[6249.99s -> 6252.74s]  Oh look another rock, oh cool
[6252.74s -> 6254.74s]  And there's a sunset that you could have taken a picture of too
[6254.74s -> 6257.62s]  Oh good rock in the way
[6257.62s -> 6260.17s]  Come on, come on
[6260.17s -> 6262.17s]  You know what, I apologize
[6262.17s -> 6266.01s]  For this
[6266.01s -> 6272.92s]  Oh my god, that's somebody's asshole
[6272.92s -> 6277.13s]  I hope it's not mine
[6277.13s -> 6279.13s]  Nah it's mine, it's mine
[6295.88s -> 6298.25s]  Hey Ma, don't look in the trash
[6300.25s -> 6302.25s]  Yeah
[6302.25s -> 6304.25s]  Somebody at
[6304.25s -> 6306.25s]  What's the name of
[6306.25s -> 6310.15s]  What's the name of the studio
[6310.15s -> 6313.61s]  That made that game
[6313.61s -> 6315.61s]  Somebody had to develop those shit photos
[6315.61s -> 6317.61s]  They probably thought it was like a little kid or something
[6317.61s -> 6319.61s]  You know what I mean
[6319.61s -> 6321.61s]  Like every photo
[6321.61s -> 6323.61s]  Was of a rock or like of a ceiling
[6323.61s -> 6325.61s]  And that cost money to do that
[6325.61s -> 6327.61s]  That wasn't free
[6327.61s -> 6329.98s]  Somebody had to develop all those shitty
[6329.98s -> 6331.98s]  Photos in the game and send them to me
[6331.98s -> 6336.90s]  That's the funniest part of this video to me
[6336.90s -> 6338.90s]  Is that somebody was like
[6338.90s -> 6340.90s]  Putting that package together and going
[6340.90s -> 6342.90s]  Holy shit
[6342.90s -> 6350.71s]  Like why did you pay for this
[6350.71s -> 6352.71s]  The studio that made Firewatch is now part of Valve
[6352.71s -> 6357.64s]  That's true
[6357.64s -> 6359.64s]  Something that I've noticed over the last
[6359.64s -> 6361.64s]  Like hour and 20 minutes of this stream
[6361.64s -> 6363.94s]  I have been
[6363.94s -> 6365.94s]  Putting this up to my mouth
[6365.94s -> 6368.38s]  To drink this coffee
[6368.38s -> 6371.06s]  For about an hour
[6371.06s -> 6373.06s]  And there's nothing in it, there hasn't been anything in this in over an hour
[6373.06s -> 6381.50s]  I'm gonna go refill this
[6381.50s -> 6383.50s]  But who is that guy
[6383.50s -> 6385.50s]  I have no fucking idea
[6385.50s -> 6390.55s]  I don't have any idea
[6390.55s -> 6393.30s]  Why am I drinking from Kim's cup
[6393.30s -> 6398.81s]  Because, tell us
[6398.81s -> 6400.81s]  Tell us, do you want everything spoiled
[6400.81s -> 6409.26s]  Yes, yes
[6409.26s -> 6411.26s]  This is Kim's cup, there's your spoiler
[6411.26s -> 6414.20s]  Was it Devil's and Burger Boy
[6414.20s -> 6417.98s]  No, some things don't be
[6417.98s -> 6419.98s]  Some things don't have to be described
[6419.98s -> 6423.99s]  You know for Twitch
[6423.99s -> 6425.99s]  Terms of service purposes
[6425.99s -> 6429.70s]  That was all fake
[6429.70s -> 6431.70s]  So, just kind of hidden that realization
[6431.70s -> 6437.72s]  Right now
[6437.72s -> 6440.73s]  Anyways, I'm gonna go get some coffee
[6440.73s -> 6443.93s]  I will be right back
[6443.93s -> 6446.42s]  We'll continue to do this for like
[6446.42s -> 6449.94s]  Another hour or so
[6449.94s -> 6451.94s]  Let's get the BRB on the screen
[6451.94s -> 6643.99s]  I'll be right back
[6643.99s -> 6648.73s]  Yo, I'm back
[6648.73s -> 6655.26s]  Watching Rat Movie 1 and 2
[6655.26s -> 6657.26s]  We did that last time, I think
[6657.26s -> 6665.70s]  The secret pancake recipe
[6665.70s -> 6668.07s]  Yeah, yeah we'll do that one
[6668.07s -> 6676.01s]  Isn't this a video where I just like
[6676.01s -> 6678.01s]  What I'm shooting at people through the sniper
[6678.01s -> 6680.01s]  I just say that they're part of
[6680.01s -> 6682.01s]  Like a pancake or something
[6682.01s -> 6686.49s]  That's the whole video, right
[6686.49s -> 6690.26s]  That's the entire video
[6690.26s -> 6692.63s]  Let's see
[6692.63s -> 6701.72s]  Let's see if it holds up
[6701.72s -> 6703.72s]  This is the wrist recoil
[6703.72s -> 6710.76s]  Somebody said this is one of my worst videos
[6710.76s -> 6714.54s]  We'll see
[6714.54s -> 6719.72s]  It's a terrible recipe too
[6719.72s -> 6721.96s]  Is it?
[6721.96s -> 6723.96s]  It really is, this seems to be pretty polarized right now
[6723.96s -> 6725.96s]  This is one of my worst
[6725.96s -> 6727.96s]  Look at this hair, come on man
[6727.96s -> 6730.26s]  I need to get this part just cut
[6730.26s -> 6732.26s]  It looks so much better
[6732.26s -> 6734.26s]  I need a haircut, that's what I need
[6734.26s -> 6736.26s]  Yeah, people saying
[6736.26s -> 6738.26s]  This sucks, this is great
[6738.26s -> 6740.26s]  We got 50%, 50% here
[6740.26s -> 6742.76s]  Let's see
[6742.76s -> 6744.76s]  I have not seen this video since I probably uploaded it
[6746.76s -> 6752.07s]  Hey what's going on everybody
[6752.07s -> 6754.07s]  Jerma here with recoil
[6754.07s -> 6756.07s]  I was just spectating
[6756.07s -> 6758.07s]  I was just spectating a guy that knew what he was doing
[6758.07s -> 6760.07s]  Looks like Artman is going to go in
[6760.07s -> 6762.07s]  Going for the double shotgun shot, gets the shot
[6762.07s -> 6764.07s]  Gets two shots on him
[6764.07s -> 6766.07s]  Right there we got Artman going to be going for the kill
[6766.07s -> 6768.07s]  Going to see on the top left staircase, gets the pistol out
[6768.07s -> 6770.07s]  He's going to get him in time
[6770.07s -> 6772.31s]  He's dancing, I'm not going with the knife kills
[6772.31s -> 6775.64s]  What the fuck
[6775.64s -> 6777.64s]  What was that
[6777.64s -> 6779.64s]  That was so unexpected
[6779.64s -> 6781.64s]  What
[6781.64s -> 6783.64s]  So I guess now is a good time to do a player profile on Shizzy Boy
[6783.64s -> 6785.64s]  I guess now is time to do a player profile on Clidio
[6785.64s -> 6787.64s]  Clidio is one of those players you just love to watch guys
[6787.64s -> 6789.64s]  He has a lot of things in his arsenal
[6789.64s -> 6791.64s]  He's one of the best AK-74 players in the world
[6791.64s -> 6793.64s]  He's one of the best AK-74 players in the world
[6793.64s -> 6795.64s]  And he also plays the piano, so a good little bit of information on the player
[6795.64s -> 6797.64s]  And he also plays the piano, so a good little bit of information on the player
[6797.64s -> 6799.64s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on V2FXX
[6799.64s -> 6801.64s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on V2FXX
[6801.64s -> 6803.64s]  He is one of the best SMG players in the world
[6803.64s -> 6805.64s]  As you can probably imagine
[6805.64s -> 6807.64s]  Having an SMG is a lot better for movement and to be able to get the speed that you need
[6807.64s -> 6809.64s]  Having an SMG is a lot better for movement and to be able to get the speed that you need
[6809.64s -> 6811.64s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on
[6811.64s -> 6813.64s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Shizzy Boy
[6813.64s -> 6815.64s]  Shizzy Boy is another one of those characters you love to see
[6815.64s -> 6817.64s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on
[6817.64s -> 6819.64s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on
[6819.64s -> 6821.64s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6821.64s -> 6824.52s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6824.52s -> 6826.82s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6826.82s -> 6829.13s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6829.13s -> 6833.10s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6833.10s -> 6835.10s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6835.10s -> 6837.10s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6837.10s -> 6839.66s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6839.66s -> 6841.66s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6841.66s -> 6843.66s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6843.66s -> 6845.66s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6845.66s -> 6847.66s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6847.66s -> 6849.66s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6849.66s -> 6851.96s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6851.96s -> 6853.96s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6853.96s -> 6856.52s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6856.52s -> 6859.14s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6859.14s -> 6861.14s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6861.14s -> 6863.14s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6863.14s -> 6865.14s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6865.14s -> 6867.14s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6867.14s -> 6869.14s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6869.14s -> 6871.14s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6871.14s -> 6873.14s]  Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio
[6873.14s -> 6876.09s]  That's a wrestler
[6876.09s -> 6878.09s]  I want to be like a WCW NWO wrestler
[6878.09s -> 6881.93s]  I want to be like a WCW NWO wrestler
[6881.93s -> 6883.93s]  There it is, killing machine
[6883.93s -> 6886.87s]  That's two
[6886.87s -> 6888.87s]  Fucking WCW guy killed me
[6888.87s -> 6895.53s]  What the fuck happened to you?
[6895.53s -> 6900.58s]  What the fuck happened to you?
[6900.58s -> 6902.58s]  I definitely want to be a WCW
[6902.58s -> 6904.76s]  We got this WCW guy
[6904.76s -> 6906.76s]  This guy is just kind of crazy looking
[6906.76s -> 6908.76s]  He's kind of creepy
[6908.76s -> 6911.19s]  And then we got tattoo guy
[6911.19s -> 6913.19s]  Why is tattoo guy the guy with the face paint?
[6913.19s -> 6915.19s]  This should be tattoo guy
[6915.19s -> 6919.74s]  Something I've noticed in every video game
[6919.74s -> 6922.23s]  That has this gun
[6922.23s -> 6924.23s]  The Draugnov always sucks
[6924.23s -> 6926.54s]  It does
[6926.54s -> 6928.54s]  Has it ever been a game made
[6928.54s -> 6930.54s]  Where the Draugnov wasn't a fucking piece of shit
[6930.54s -> 6933.16s]  Has that ever happened?
[6933.16s -> 6935.16s]  I just got three kills in a row
[6935.16s -> 6942.07s]  So let's just pretend I didn't say that
[6942.07s -> 6944.07s]  It's good in COD 4
[6946.38s -> 6950.60s]  Somebody's
[6950.60s -> 6952.60s]  Somebody learned how to play
[6954.60s -> 6958.87s]  Why?
[6958.87s -> 6961.37s]  Be a part of war
[6961.37s -> 6963.54s]  I'm gonna teach you guys
[6963.54s -> 6965.54s]  How to make pancakes, alright?
[6965.54s -> 6967.54s]  It's gonna be pretty easy
[6967.54s -> 6969.54s]  There's the first ingredient, that's two eggs
[6969.54s -> 6971.54s]  Around this corner we got
[6971.54s -> 6973.72s]  Some butter
[6973.72s -> 6975.72s]  And then of course you cannot forget
[6975.72s -> 6978.41s]  Fucking God
[6978.41s -> 6980.41s]  This is the secret recipe for pancakes
[6980.41s -> 6983.67s]  Two eggs
[6983.67s -> 6986.17s]  Then you gotta also put in the butter
[6986.17s -> 6988.47s]  But I can't find the butter, the butter ran down here
[6988.47s -> 6990.71s]  There's the butter
[6990.71s -> 6992.71s]  I missed the bowl, put the butter
[6992.71s -> 6994.71s]  Fucking God damn it
[6994.71s -> 6996.71s]  Hey what's going on everybody, Jerma here
[6996.71s -> 6998.71s]  Welcome to Cooking with Jerma
[6998.71s -> 7000.71s]  This is a new series I'm doing
[7000.71s -> 7002.71s]  Where I show you how to make a very healthy, very nice breakfast
[7002.71s -> 7004.71s]  And what you want is you want a bowl
[7004.71s -> 7006.71s]  A bowl large enough to put a bunch of stuff in obviously
[7006.71s -> 7008.71s]  Because we're gonna give you my secret recipe for pancakes
[7008.71s -> 7010.71s]  So what you want to do
[7010.71s -> 7012.71s]  Is of course you want to put in
[7012.71s -> 7014.71s]  Two eggs
[7014.71s -> 7016.71s]  A little bit of butter
[7016.71s -> 7018.71s]  Hold on, hold on
[7018.71s -> 7020.71s]  The butter fell on the floor
[7020.71s -> 7022.71s]  I gotta pick up the butter
[7022.71s -> 7025.34s]  There's the butter
[7025.34s -> 7027.34s]  There's the butter, butter's in the bowl now
[7027.34s -> 7029.34s]  Then of course you gotta add the flour
[7029.34s -> 7031.51s]  Flour is shooting at me
[7031.51s -> 7035.03s]  Flour's shooting at me, it's okay
[7035.03s -> 7037.85s]  Flour killed me
[7037.85s -> 7039.85s]  Welcome to Cooking with Jerma guys
[7039.85s -> 7041.85s]  In this episode
[7041.85s -> 7043.85s]  I'm gonna teach you how to make pancakes
[7043.85s -> 7045.85s]  Those of you that think you know how to make pancakes
[7045.85s -> 7047.85s]  You got it all wrong, you see
[7047.85s -> 7049.85s]  Then once you get that bowl
[7049.85s -> 7052.22s]  You throw in two eggs
[7052.22s -> 7054.22s]  Once the eggs are in there you put in the flour
[7054.22s -> 7056.22s]  Once the flour's in there
[7056.22s -> 7058.22s]  You roll your sleeves up
[7058.22s -> 7060.22s]  Get your hands a little bit dirty
[7060.22s -> 7062.22s]  And you add a little bit more butter
[7062.22s -> 7064.84s]  God damn it
[7064.84s -> 7066.84s]  Do you understand how hard you're trying
[7066.84s -> 7068.84s]  To make one of the worst jokes I have ever heard
[7068.84s -> 7072.30s]  I'm getting behind them
[7072.30s -> 7074.30s]  I'm getting in their spawn
[7074.30s -> 7076.30s]  And it's gonna be a big fucking surprise
[7076.30s -> 7078.66s]  When I get in there
[7078.66s -> 7080.66s]  Speaking of big surprise
[7080.66s -> 7082.66s]  Somebody would just be making a video
[7082.66s -> 7084.66s]  And the other person would just be like
[7084.66s -> 7086.66s]  Reacting to what the hell they were saying
[7086.66s -> 7088.66s]  What is this?
[7088.66s -> 7090.66s]  What is this fucking Gumby?
[7093.16s -> 7095.16s]  What is that like fucking
[7095.16s -> 7097.16s]  Stretch Armstrong in like a fucking
[7097.16s -> 7100.23s]  Taffy factory
[7100.23s -> 7102.23s]  And we're coming out of the wire here guys
[7102.23s -> 7104.23s]  This is the final moment in the 2016
[7104.23s -> 7106.23s]  Recoil tournament
[7106.23s -> 7108.23s]  Welcome, I'm very glad to do it with you
[7108.23s -> 7110.23s]  We're very glad to cast
[7110.23s -> 7112.23s]  With you
[7112.23s -> 7114.23s]  Very glad to do it
[7114.23s -> 7116.23s]  V2 coming around with a
[7116.23s -> 7118.23s]  Shot rifle, get a couple of shots on him
[7118.23s -> 7120.23s]  Shizzyboy is looking bad here
[7120.23s -> 7122.23s]  He's gonna jump on the top and he gets the kill
[7122.23s -> 7124.23s]  With his super duper scoper
[7124.23s -> 7126.23s]  And he gets a good
[7126.23s -> 7128.23s]  Shot
[7128.23s -> 7130.23s]  And he turns around, we got the cash drive
[7130.23s -> 7132.23s]  We're getting wrapped around by two people and oh my god
[7132.23s -> 7134.23s]  Did you see that fucking backflip
[7134.23s -> 7139.99s]  Super duper
[7139.99s -> 7148.31s]  Super duper scoper doper
[7148.31s -> 7151.58s]  Ow, my fucking teeth
[7151.58s -> 7154.14s]  Do you ever do that? I hate that
[7154.14s -> 7156.14s]  Sometimes I wish I could just like
[7156.14s -> 7158.14s]  You know how an airplane pulls its wheels up
[7158.14s -> 7160.14s]  Before it lands? I'd love if I could just like
[7160.14s -> 7162.14s]  Pull up all my front teeth
[7162.14s -> 7164.14s]  Like before I take a sip
[7164.14s -> 7166.82s]  I hit my teeth all the fucking time
[7166.82s -> 7168.82s]  I got these big ass teeth
[7168.82s -> 7171.00s]  I really just want to like
[7171.00s -> 7173.00s]  Have them retract up into my mouth
[7173.00s -> 7178.89s]  Time gun? We watched time gun last time
[7178.89s -> 7186.25s]  Let's see
[7186.25s -> 7188.25s]  Impossible creatures
[7188.25s -> 7190.25s]  Somebody was asking for that earlier
[7190.25s -> 7198.63s]  Oh shit, I do remember this
[7198.63s -> 7200.63s]  I remember this video
[7200.63s -> 7204.34s]  This game is so strange
[7204.34s -> 7210.17s]  I feel like I'd want to play this game again
[7210.17s -> 7213.11s]  It was a weird one
[7213.11s -> 7217.34s]  Impossible creatures
[7217.34s -> 7227.24s]  I don't know
[7227.24s -> 7229.24s]  Star also in this video, you didn't know
[7229.24s -> 7231.24s]  No, there's something wrong here
[7231.24s -> 7233.24s]  There's something wrong
[7233.24s -> 7235.24s]  It's the elephant, I know elephant
[7235.24s -> 7237.24s]  It's gotta be something else
[7237.24s -> 7239.48s]  Now that's what I'm talking about
[7239.48s -> 7241.78s]  That is the perfect animal
[7241.78s -> 7244.54s]  This game is fucking so stupid
[7244.54s -> 7246.54s]  Hey
[7246.54s -> 7248.54s]  What are you doing over here?
[7248.54s -> 7250.54s]  Click on him and look at his name
[7250.54s -> 7252.54s]  What is that? Look at its name
[7252.54s -> 7256.70s]  Jerma in real life?
[7256.70s -> 7259.56s]  XT
[7259.56s -> 7261.56s]  Is that a hippopotamus gorilla?
[7261.56s -> 7263.56s]  Yeah
[7263.56s -> 7265.56s]  Get out of here
[7265.56s -> 7267.56s]  This is a giraffe
[7267.56s -> 7269.56s]  Skunk turf
[7269.56s -> 7271.56s]  I don't think you could have hurt him
[7271.56s -> 7273.56s]  Can I not kill this?
[7273.56s -> 7275.56s]  Get out of here
[7275.56s -> 7277.56s]  He's too awesome
[7277.56s -> 7279.56s]  Come help me long guy
[7279.56s -> 7281.56s]  What do you mean long guy?
[7284.70s -> 7286.70s]  Oh you can do like dachshund right?
[7286.70s -> 7288.70s]  Is that a dachshund?
[7288.70s -> 7290.70s]  Ready boss
[7290.70s -> 7292.70s]  You're the boss
[7292.70s -> 7294.70s]  No building is up
[7294.70s -> 7296.70s]  Somebody's cheating
[7296.70s -> 7298.70s]  Oh really?
[7298.70s -> 7300.70s]  Thanks for the heads up
[7300.70s -> 7303.00s]  No
[7303.00s -> 7306.89s]  Stop
[7306.89s -> 7308.89s]  Just stay here
[7308.89s -> 7310.89s]  Just stay here
[7310.89s -> 7312.89s]  Can I do anything?
[7312.89s -> 7314.89s]  Shark, can I do any funny moves?
[7314.89s -> 7316.89s]  Where are my funny moves?
[7318.89s -> 7320.89s]  One of these times you're gonna spawn there and it's gonna kill you
[7320.89s -> 7322.89s]  The critters are under attack
[7322.89s -> 7324.89s]  Got him
[7324.89s -> 7326.89s]  That's not fair
[7326.89s -> 7329.13s]  No it's really not
[7329.13s -> 7331.13s]  And what the hell are you two doing?
[7331.13s -> 7333.82s]  You're supposed to be guarding the perimeter
[7333.82s -> 7335.82s]  Kill him
[7335.82s -> 7337.82s]  No kill him
[7337.82s -> 7339.82s]  Kill the disappearing shark
[7339.82s -> 7341.82s]  He's dead, no you got him
[7341.82s -> 7343.82s]  I did not kill him
[7343.82s -> 7347.45s]  He is very much alive
[7347.45s -> 7349.45s]  He has like a teleporting laser ant shark
[7351.62s -> 7355.21s]  How am I supposed to win?
[7355.21s -> 7357.21s]  I can't
[7357.21s -> 7359.64s]  Stop
[7359.64s -> 7361.64s]  Let them have a fight
[7361.64s -> 7363.64s]  You're not supposed to just let them die
[7363.64s -> 7365.64s]  That was all the fight I had
[7365.64s -> 7367.64s]  The critters are under attack
[7367.64s -> 7369.64s]  Come on
[7369.64s -> 7372.78s]  This game is so stupid
[7376.78s -> 7378.78s]  What the fuck?
[7378.78s -> 7381.02s]  What?
[7381.02s -> 7383.90s]  You don't like
[7383.90s -> 7385.90s]  You don't appreciate the meta
[7385.90s -> 7388.07s]  What meta?
[7388.07s -> 7390.07s]  The overlord scouting meta
[7390.07s -> 7392.82s]  No building is up
[7392.82s -> 7394.82s]  I don't think I understand this joke
[7394.82s -> 7397.00s]  That's a whale bee
[7397.00s -> 7399.00s]  The overlord?
[7399.00s -> 7401.00s]  No he's like a zerg
[7401.00s -> 7403.00s]  You send your overlord out to scout first
[7403.00s -> 7405.00s]  I didn't play starcraft
[7405.00s -> 7408.14s]  I have no idea
[7408.14s -> 7410.14s]  I have not played starcraft enough to know what that is
[7410.14s -> 7412.76s]  I think everyone
[7412.76s -> 7414.76s]  Who has ever played a video game
[7414.76s -> 7416.76s]  At the very least
[7416.76s -> 7419.19s]  Knows what a fucking zerg rush is
[7419.19s -> 7421.94s]  Yeah well
[7421.94s -> 7423.94s]  Here comes my zerg links
[7423.94s -> 7426.70s]  I wasn't even ready
[7426.70s -> 7428.70s]  That's so fucking cute
[7428.70s -> 7430.70s]  Come on
[7433.58s -> 7435.58s]  It's like turtle ants
[7435.58s -> 7437.58s]  Okay alright
[7437.58s -> 7439.58s]  You're overarching theme
[7439.58s -> 7441.58s]  You're doing a starcraft thing with your turtle bugs
[7441.58s -> 7444.14s]  That's really great
[7444.14s -> 7446.44s]  It is really great
[7446.44s -> 7448.44s]  Get the fuck out of here
[7448.44s -> 7450.44s]  Get this thing and get your overlord
[7450.44s -> 7452.44s]  And fucking stuff it up your ass
[7452.44s -> 7454.87s]  He's coming for himself
[7454.87s -> 7457.43s]  We have plenty of units
[7457.43s -> 7459.43s]  The strangest animal
[7459.43s -> 7462.57s]  The whole time
[7462.57s -> 7464.57s]  I love how they're not even attacking
[7464.57s -> 7466.57s]  Attack them
[7466.57s -> 7468.57s]  Kill them
[7468.57s -> 7470.57s]  Kill the people
[7470.57s -> 7472.57s]  This is so shit
[7472.57s -> 7475.51s]  Get them
[7475.51s -> 7477.51s]  We're not going to win
[7477.51s -> 7479.51s]  We're not going to win
[7479.51s -> 7481.51s]  Steal their coal
[7481.51s -> 7483.51s]  Get out of here
[7483.51s -> 7485.51s]  Spit it out
[7485.51s -> 7488.33s]  Start mining
[7488.33s -> 7490.33s]  Everyone mine it
[7490.33s -> 7492.33s]  I would have figured these guys would be dead
[7492.33s -> 7495.08s]  Way long ago
[7495.08s -> 7497.08s]  They are going to eat
[7497.08s -> 7499.08s]  My giant crocodile bears
[7499.08s -> 7501.08s]  He's getting out with the coal
[7501.08s -> 7503.08s]  Where are all the sound effects
[7503.08s -> 7505.08s]  Are you making that
[7505.08s -> 7507.08s]  You don't let them get away with the coal
[7507.08s -> 7509.08s]  That's our coal
[7509.08s -> 7511.08s]  Kick his ass
[7511.08s -> 7514.28s]  We're taking this into the base
[7514.28s -> 7516.71s]  We are taking this shit into the base
[7516.71s -> 7518.71s]  After you kill them Darren
[7518.71s -> 7520.71s]  Go for it Darren
[7520.71s -> 7522.71s]  The fights in this are so anticlimactic
[7522.71s -> 7524.71s]  Kill them all Darren
[7524.71s -> 7526.95s]  That's right
[7526.95s -> 7528.95s]  Who is Darren
[7528.95s -> 7530.95s]  Very good Darren
[7530.95s -> 7532.95s]  Very good job Darren
[7532.95s -> 7534.95s]  You thought for one second you could fuck with the Darren's
[7534.95s -> 7536.95s]  I didn't think I could
[7536.95s -> 7538.95s]  Come on Darren
[7538.95s -> 7540.95s]  You've cracked this Darren
[7540.95s -> 7543.32s]  He thinks he can beat us with his beaver praying magisters
[7543.32s -> 7545.32s]  Does he know who you are
[7545.32s -> 7547.32s]  You're fucking Darren
[7547.32s -> 7550.82s]  No
[7550.82s -> 7556.26s]  For centuries
[7556.26s -> 7558.57s]  I don't know how to start this
[7558.57s -> 7560.57s]  How do you start this
[7560.57s -> 7562.57s]  I don't know
[7562.57s -> 7565.13s]  What are we fighting for
[7565.13s -> 7567.75s]  I would like to speak with your leader
[7567.75s -> 7569.75s]  Yes
[7569.75s -> 7571.75s]  The other leader
[7571.75s -> 7573.75s]  We have plenty of leaders
[7573.75s -> 7575.75s]  When one goes down the other will take his place
[7575.75s -> 7577.75s]  I need at least one
[7577.75s -> 7579.75s]  There's another one right here
[7579.75s -> 7581.75s]  Would you like to see a new one
[7581.75s -> 7583.75s]  This is also a leader
[7583.75s -> 7586.06s]  One of your guys
[7586.06s -> 7588.06s]  We caught the other day
[7588.06s -> 7590.06s]  He was on our sand
[7590.06s -> 7592.06s]  Play this again
[7592.06s -> 7594.06s]  I don't believe that
[7594.06s -> 7596.06s]  We had a treaty 2000 years ago
[7596.06s -> 7598.06s]  Your people and our people
[7598.06s -> 7600.06s]  That this bridge shall never be crossed
[7600.06s -> 7602.06s]  Unless for diplomatic reasons
[7602.06s -> 7604.06s]  We're crossing it right now
[7604.06s -> 7606.06s]  We caught one of your
[7606.06s -> 7608.06s]  What are you going to do about it
[7608.06s -> 7610.06s]  It's an act of war
[7610.06s -> 7612.06s]  You back up while that is an act of war
[7612.06s -> 7614.06s]  It's an act of war
[7614.06s -> 7616.06s]  What
[7616.06s -> 7618.06s]  Holy shit
[7620.06s -> 7622.06s]  Oh my god
[7624.55s -> 7626.55s]  Holy shit
[7626.55s -> 7628.79s]  I forgot about that
[7628.79s -> 7630.79s]  Why did you say nuclear transform
[7630.79s -> 7632.79s]  I don't know
[7632.79s -> 7635.35s]  Nuclear
[7635.35s -> 7637.35s]  I said not nuclear this time
[7637.35s -> 7642.41s]  Right
[7642.41s -> 7644.41s]  Do the pacman first person maze video
[7644.41s -> 7646.41s]  No it's not
[7646.41s -> 7651.59s]  Co-op crusade
[7651.59s -> 7664.71s]  That's a good one
[7664.71s -> 7668.81s]  That's a good one
[7668.81s -> 7670.81s]  This is another one of those videos
[7670.81s -> 7672.81s]  That half way through making it
[7672.81s -> 7675.30s]  I said this video is bad
[7675.30s -> 7677.30s]  But then I powered through it
[7677.30s -> 7679.30s]  And it turned out it was one of my favorite
[7679.30s -> 7685.96s]  Just stupid shitty co-op videos
[7685.96s -> 7687.96s]  It got to that point
[7687.96s -> 7689.96s]  I was in the editing zone
[7689.96s -> 7691.96s]  I was at like minute number 4
[7691.96s -> 7694.58s]  Or 3 or something
[7694.58s -> 7696.58s]  Just going no
[7696.58s -> 7698.58s]  I'm going to have to can this
[7698.58s -> 7700.58s]  I've canned videos before
[7700.58s -> 7702.58s]  This is what people I don't think understand
[7702.58s -> 7704.58s]  I wish I could go back in time
[7704.58s -> 7706.58s]  And just tell myself
[7706.58s -> 7708.58s]  Look don't upload it
[7708.58s -> 7710.58s]  You don't have to upload it
[7710.58s -> 7712.58s]  Just put it in this folder
[7712.58s -> 7714.58s]  Just put it in that folder right there
[7714.58s -> 7716.58s]  And just hold on to it
[7716.58s -> 7718.58s]  Put it on the thumb drive and forget about it
[7718.58s -> 7720.58s]  This is one of those videos that I made
[7720.58s -> 7722.58s]  That I didn't like and wasn't happy with
[7722.58s -> 7724.58s]  That 2018-2019 me
[7724.58s -> 7726.58s]  Would love to show you
[7726.58s -> 7728.58s]  Unfortunately
[7728.58s -> 7734.86s]  But that's not the case
[7734.86s -> 7739.72s]  It's too bad
[7739.72s -> 7743.82s]  Too bad
[7743.82s -> 7751.11s]  But that's just the way it is
[7751.11s -> 7753.11s]  If he was in the editing zone
[7753.11s -> 7755.11s]  My name is Jean de Baille
[7755.11s -> 7757.11s]  One of the Order of the Night's Tempest
[7757.11s -> 7759.11s]  This is so loud and annoying
[7759.11s -> 7761.11s]  Fucking Gerald
[7761.11s -> 7763.42s]  This is a long opening cutscene
[7763.42s -> 7765.72s]  It was very long
[7765.72s -> 7767.72s]  What if it turns out me and you are these two guys
[7769.72s -> 7771.72s]  Alright can we play
[7771.72s -> 7773.72s]  I want like 30 more cutscenes
[7775.72s -> 7777.72s]  Wait is this us
[7777.72s -> 7779.72s]  I think that this is supposed to be both of us
[7781.72s -> 7784.09s]  Alright let's fucking play this dumb game
[7786.09s -> 7788.09s]  What
[7788.09s -> 7790.09s]  Their story didn't just begin
[7790.09s -> 7792.09s]  My family
[7792.09s -> 7794.09s]  February evening in the year 1199
[7794.09s -> 7796.09s]  My quest remains unfinished
[7796.09s -> 7798.09s]  As for Dems
[7798.09s -> 7800.09s]  His is about to begin
[7800.09s -> 7802.09s]  But as fate would have it
[7802.09s -> 7804.09s]  There is another hero
[7804.09s -> 7806.09s]  Who would be impossible to forget
[7806.09s -> 7808.09s]  Who are these people
[7808.09s -> 7810.09s]  There's like two even introduced to so many characters
[7810.09s -> 7812.09s]  There's too many people in this game
[7812.09s -> 7814.09s]  They're prized with pretty tunics
[7814.09s -> 7816.09s]  Have any wields that sword
[7816.09s -> 7818.09s]  No better than a farmer
[7818.09s -> 7820.09s]  This new character
[7820.09s -> 7822.09s]  Wait we get to play
[7830.09s -> 7832.09s]  Dems is a talented swordsman
[7832.09s -> 7834.09s]  Who has never let fear get him in a fight
[7834.09s -> 7836.09s]  Perhaps that strength
[7836.09s -> 7838.09s]  Returns to him
[7838.09s -> 7840.09s]  The Templar's threat
[7840.09s -> 7842.09s]  Is a terrible one
[7842.09s -> 7844.09s]  I wasn't this good
[7844.09s -> 7846.09s]  That was not doing this good
[7846.09s -> 7848.09s]  Is that you
[7848.09s -> 7850.09s]  I don't know
[7850.09s -> 7852.65s]  Why is there a Mortal Kombat character here
[7852.65s -> 7854.65s]  Alright different universes
[7854.65s -> 7856.65s]  Where am I
[7856.65s -> 7858.65s]  What is happening
[7858.65s -> 7860.65s]  I died
[7860.65s -> 7867.05s]  He's gonna kill me
[7867.05s -> 7869.05s]  Dems is a talented swordsman
[7869.05s -> 7871.05s]  Who has never let fear get him in a fight
[7871.05s -> 7873.05s]  Perhaps that strength
[7873.05s -> 7875.05s]  Returns to him
[7875.05s -> 7878.38s]  The Templar's threat
[7878.38s -> 7880.38s]  Returns to him
[7880.38s -> 7883.26s]  Alright but hold on
[7883.26s -> 7885.26s]  Wait a second
[7885.26s -> 7887.26s]  Here's the thing about this video and about this game
[7887.26s -> 7889.26s]  What the fuck is going on right now
[7889.26s -> 7891.26s]  I hit space
[7891.26s -> 7893.26s]  I still this many years later
[7893.26s -> 7895.43s]  Have no idea what was going on here
[7895.43s -> 7897.43s]  There's a prompt on the screen
[7897.43s -> 7899.43s]  But you can also move your character
[7899.43s -> 7903.70s]  So I'm on the top
[7903.70s -> 7905.70s]  Right
[7905.70s -> 7907.70s]  See the prompt on the screen is down
[7907.70s -> 7909.88s]  Down press down
[7909.88s -> 7911.88s]  So I'll press down
[7911.88s -> 7913.88s]  The screen prompts
[7913.88s -> 7915.88s]  I did
[7915.88s -> 7917.88s]  What it told me to do
[7917.88s -> 7920.12s]  I pressed the down key
[7920.12s -> 7925.11s]  Dems is a talented swordsman
[7925.11s -> 7927.11s]  Dems is a talented swordsman
[7927.11s -> 7929.11s]  Who has never let
[7929.11s -> 7931.11s]  Direct D perform a normal attack
[7931.11s -> 7933.11s]  Counter co-op star
[7935.42s -> 7937.42s]  Why does it say that
[7937.42s -> 7939.42s]  Why is it DC
[7939.42s -> 7941.42s]  Why wouldn't it be like ABC
[7941.42s -> 7943.42s]  Why is it star
[7943.42s -> 7945.66s]  What's going on with you
[7945.66s -> 7947.66s]  A lot of weird shit going on
[7947.66s -> 7949.90s]  That's performed when I grab an enemy
[7949.90s -> 7951.90s]  Gee that's HML
[7951.90s -> 7953.90s]  The low isn't star
[7958.63s -> 7960.63s]  That's another character
[7960.63s -> 7962.63s]  He missed every arrow
[7962.63s -> 7964.63s]  Did you see how many arrows he just shot
[7964.63s -> 7966.63s]  He missed every one
[7966.63s -> 7968.63s]  They didn't even get close
[7968.63s -> 7970.63s]  They were all in unison
[7970.63s -> 7972.63s]  They landed right in front of these guys
[7972.63s -> 7974.63s]  They just missed them
[7974.63s -> 7976.63s]  They really are just firing
[7976.63s -> 7978.63s]  Like 10 feet in front of them
[7980.63s -> 7982.81s]  Come on you gotta do some more work
[7982.81s -> 7984.81s]  I'm doing all the work here on the left
[7984.81s -> 7987.24s]  Are you dead
[7987.24s -> 7990.12s]  Take cover
[7990.12s -> 7992.12s]  Now's our chance
[7992.12s -> 7994.12s]  Let's go
[7994.12s -> 7996.12s]  Right in the mouth
[7996.12s -> 7998.12s]  Right in the face
[7998.12s -> 8000.12s]  Now's our chance
[8000.12s -> 8002.12s]  Now's our chance
[8002.12s -> 8004.12s]  Let's go
[8008.12s -> 8010.12s]  It went clearly all the way over my head
[8012.12s -> 8014.12s]  Right in the face
[8014.12s -> 8016.12s]  He just put his hand up and wiped his face
[8018.12s -> 8020.12s]  This game is a treasure
[8020.12s -> 8022.12s]  Where are these guys on the right
[8022.12s -> 8024.12s]  Which characters are we right now
[8024.12s -> 8026.12s]  All of your audio is on the left
[8026.12s -> 8028.12s]  Mine's all on the right or something
[8028.12s -> 8030.12s]  I just ran away
[8032.12s -> 8034.12s]  Fuck
[8034.12s -> 8036.12s]  He just took off
[8036.12s -> 8038.12s]  This guy died
[8038.12s -> 8040.12s]  I'm outta here
[8040.12s -> 8042.12s]  Listen to this shit
[8042.12s -> 8044.12s]  All of your audio is on the left
[8044.12s -> 8046.12s]  Mine's all on the right or something
[8048.12s -> 8050.12s]  I just ran away
[8052.12s -> 8054.12s]  I fucking love this game
[8054.12s -> 8056.12s]  He just took off
[8056.12s -> 8058.12s]  This guy died
[8058.12s -> 8060.30s]  I'm outta here
[8060.30s -> 8062.30s]  Those guys on the left are dead
[8064.30s -> 8066.30s]  That guy got shot with a machine gun
[8068.30s -> 8070.30s]  So I can, you step out and
[8070.30s -> 8074.90s]  It's inverted
[8074.90s -> 8076.90s]  It's inverted
[8076.90s -> 8081.51s]  Mine's inverted
[8081.51s -> 8083.51s]  Shoot him
[8083.51s -> 8088.18s]  What the fuck
[8088.18s -> 8090.18s]  That's a bad guy
[8090.18s -> 8092.18s]  That's a bad guy
[8092.18s -> 8094.18s]  Oh yeah, we didn't know if they were NPCs on our side or not
[8094.18s -> 8096.18s]  Look at this fucking co-op
[8096.18s -> 8098.18s]  It could probably fit us both on the same screen
[8098.18s -> 8100.18s]  I don't really
[8100.18s -> 8102.18s]  It could probably just be one screen
[8102.18s -> 8104.18s]  We probably could be on one screen right now
[8106.42s -> 8108.42s]  Is that an enemy
[8112.71s -> 8114.95s]  This is really gonna be a headache
[8114.95s -> 8116.95s]  This is where we came from
[8116.95s -> 8118.95s]  We're going the wrong way
[8118.95s -> 8121.70s]  They have two screens
[8121.70s -> 8123.70s]  Your turn now
[8123.70s -> 8125.70s]  This is the boss
[8125.70s -> 8127.70s]  Alright, first boss fight
[8127.70s -> 8130.39s]  You ready?
[8130.39s -> 8132.39s]  What's the strategy
[8132.39s -> 8134.89s]  Alright, just co-op him
[8134.89s -> 8136.89s]  Just co-op him
[8138.89s -> 8140.89s]  Just co-op this guy
[8140.89s -> 8144.15s]  Right into the fire
[8148.15s -> 8150.15s]  Good god, we co-op'd him
[8150.15s -> 8152.15s]  Yeah, you guys know how to do that
[8154.15s -> 8156.15s]  Oh shit, he's a demon
[8156.15s -> 8158.97s]  You ready to co-op this guy?
[8158.97s -> 8173.62s]  That shit probably went down
[8173.62s -> 8175.62s]  In real life though
[8175.62s -> 8177.62s]  What a fucking useless enemy
[8177.62s -> 8179.62s]  Dude, in real life
[8179.62s -> 8181.62s]  If there's like two or three people swinging at you at the same time
[8181.62s -> 8183.62s]  You're gonna get fucking pelted over and over
[8183.62s -> 8185.62s]  Pope Innocent
[8187.62s -> 8189.62s]  Guaranteed that guy's a demon
[8189.62s -> 8192.18s]  You don't have a name like
[8192.18s -> 8194.18s]  Pope Innocent III
[8194.18s -> 8196.18s]  If you're not the bad guy of the whole game
[8196.18s -> 8198.18s]  It's funny cause this is all historically accurate
[8198.18s -> 8200.18s]  It's funny cause this is all historically accurate
[8200.18s -> 8202.18s]  That's probably a real guy
[8202.18s -> 8204.18s]  That is a real person
[8204.18s -> 8206.18s]  Here's the typical bored king
[8206.18s -> 8208.18s]  Eventually, I hope somebody makes me
[8208.18s -> 8210.18s]  Come from my sleep
[8210.18s -> 8212.18s]  And see these two gentlemen
[8212.18s -> 8214.18s]  See how good they did
[8214.18s -> 8225.94s]  I'll speak to them now
[8225.94s -> 8228.18s]  You, you won't defeat me
[8237.26s -> 8240.84s]  This game sucks
[8240.84s -> 8242.84s]  Uh oh
[8242.84s -> 8245.14s]  Rain is back
[8245.14s -> 8249.48s]  Mortality
[8249.48s -> 8251.78s]  This game was not made for two people to play it
[8251.78s -> 8253.78s]  This game was not made for two people to play it
[8263.78s -> 8265.78s]  He's dead
[8265.78s -> 8267.78s]  No, we have to do the sacred flames
[8271.78s -> 8273.78s]  No, he's dead, he's gone, we won
[8273.78s -> 8275.78s]  What? There was a whole plan
[8275.78s -> 8277.78s]  We couldn't even hear the whole plan
[8277.78s -> 8279.78s]  We co-opted him too fast
[8279.78s -> 8281.78s]  We couldn't even hear the plan
[8281.78s -> 8283.78s]  This is not normal
[8283.78s -> 8285.78s]  The way they were talking
[8285.78s -> 8287.78s]  That wasn't even supposed to happen
[8287.78s -> 8289.78s]  It was like you create a diversion and we'll do a purifying flame
[8289.78s -> 8291.78s]  No, he's just dead
[8291.78s -> 8293.78s]  I pressed X
[8300.04s -> 8302.86s]  Some of these old videos
[8302.86s -> 8304.86s]  Some of these old videos
[8304.86s -> 8306.86s]  Me and Star used to play some of these games
[8306.86s -> 8309.42s]  God, I just don't remember
[8309.42s -> 8311.42s]  Everything that all of my emotions
[8311.42s -> 8315.51s]  Are coming back to me
[8315.51s -> 8317.51s]  Some of these games are fucking so hilarious
[8317.51s -> 8320.78s]  This is a good one too
[8320.78s -> 8322.78s]  Hacker and the slacker, that's a good one
[8322.78s -> 8326.74s]  Raven's cry, we watched
[8326.74s -> 8328.74s]  Raven's cry last time
[8328.74s -> 8341.10s]  We did that before
[8341.10s -> 8343.10s]  I think we did both Raven's cry last time
[8343.10s -> 8347.70s]  We did tactical intervention last time
[8347.70s -> 8349.70s]  Let's do hacker and the slacker
[8349.70s -> 8356.49s]  This is a long video
[8356.49s -> 8360.71s]  This is a ten minute video
[8360.71s -> 8373.70s]  This is a long one
[8373.70s -> 8381.51s]  Hacker and the slacker
[8381.51s -> 8386.76s]  Dude, Diablo 3
[8386.76s -> 8389.19s]  I made like a
[8389.19s -> 8391.19s]  I streamed it and played it a bunch
[8397.32s -> 8399.32s]  Replay all of my blazing bullet heads
[8399.32s -> 8401.75s]  In Sekiro
[8401.75s -> 8403.75s]  I need to wait for you
[8403.75s -> 8407.02s]  To disable that camcorder
[8407.02s -> 8409.02s]  Take out that camcorder
[8409.02s -> 8411.32s]  Hold on
[8411.32s -> 8413.32s]  There's a lot more to hacking
[8413.32s -> 8415.32s]  Than there is walking down an alley
[8415.32s -> 8417.32s]  And getting caught
[8417.32s -> 8419.32s]  This screen is four different windows
[8419.32s -> 8421.32s]  Of views and each one has a tutorial
[8421.32s -> 8423.32s]  On it right now
[8423.32s -> 8425.32s]  Pager, Martin can lure enemies
[8425.32s -> 8427.32s]  Away from their post by calling a thrown pager
[8427.32s -> 8430.14s]  A thrown pager
[8430.14s -> 8432.14s]  So apparently I can throw this pager
[8432.14s -> 8434.14s]  And this guy is gonna go get it
[8434.14s -> 8438.30s]  Can you make that thing buzz
[8438.30s -> 8440.92s]  This game is actually really cool
[8440.92s -> 8442.92s]  Oh shit, you just did that, okay
[8442.92s -> 8445.67s]  Yeah, I just called it
[8445.67s -> 8447.67s]  So I just sprint by this guy?
[8447.67s -> 8449.67s]  Oh, he turned
[8449.67s -> 8451.67s]  It's okay
[8451.67s -> 8454.49s]  Is he still turning?
[8454.49s -> 8456.49s]  I think it's fine
[8456.49s -> 8458.49s]  Stop calling that
[8458.49s -> 8463.61s]  Stop that
[8463.61s -> 8465.61s]  Stop
[8465.61s -> 8467.61s]  Okay
[8467.61s -> 8469.61s]  You just, no, you idiot
[8469.61s -> 8473.13s]  You like
[8473.13s -> 8475.13s]  You are hammering my
[8475.13s -> 8477.13s]  Brain
[8477.13s -> 8479.69s]  Is there a computer? Yes
[8479.69s -> 8481.69s]  Then plug me in, I'll see about getting you the code
[8481.69s -> 8483.69s]  Oh, well there's a gun in here too
[8483.69s -> 8486.31s]  Hey, plug me in
[8486.31s -> 8488.68s]  Plug me in
[8488.68s -> 8490.68s]  Oh fuck, was that the computer we were supposed to use?
[8492.68s -> 8495.69s]  No, there's three people in here
[8495.69s -> 8498.31s]  They'll all hear you
[8498.31s -> 8500.87s]  It's been a while
[8500.87s -> 8502.87s]  Throw your fucking pager
[8502.87s -> 8504.87s]  I don't have my pager anymore
[8509.27s -> 8511.27s]  Oh no
[8511.27s -> 8513.27s]  I'm running
[8513.27s -> 8515.27s]  They don't see me
[8515.27s -> 8517.27s]  He's running towards your door
[8517.27s -> 8519.27s]  He's running towards your door
[8519.27s -> 8521.27s]  He's walking through the door
[8521.27s -> 8523.27s]  Sneak over here
[8523.27s -> 8525.27s]  His pathing is bad, he couldn't do it
[8525.27s -> 8527.27s]  He's coming
[8527.27s -> 8529.64s]  I'm hiding
[8529.64s -> 8531.64s]  I forget this whole thing
[8531.64s -> 8533.64s]  You gotta shoot
[8533.64s -> 8537.80s]  Shot like nine times
[8537.80s -> 8540.42s]  No one heard that
[8540.42s -> 8542.79s]  You're clear to go Ghost Rider
[8542.79s -> 8544.79s]  Alright, thanks a lot
[8544.79s -> 8548.18s]  He's coming up the stairs
[8548.18s -> 8550.92s]  He's coming, dude
[8550.92s -> 8552.92s]  Hold on, page him
[8552.92s -> 8556.18s]  Page him
[8556.18s -> 8558.18s]  It actually worked
[8558.18s -> 8560.18s]  I did, I paged them
[8560.18s -> 8562.18s]  There's three of them
[8562.18s -> 8564.18s]  Just keep paging it
[8564.18s -> 8567.37s]  This page
[8567.37s -> 8569.37s]  Page, page quick
[8569.37s -> 8571.37s]  I'm paging
[8571.37s -> 8573.37s]  Making a break
[8573.37s -> 8575.37s]  Can I please stand the fuck up? That'd be great
[8575.37s -> 8579.08s]  Stand up
[8579.08s -> 8581.08s]  I got fucking destroyed
[8581.08s -> 8583.08s]  He's coming around
[8583.08s -> 8585.08s]  He's looking out the ocean
[8585.08s -> 8587.08s]  You can snap his neck
[8587.08s -> 8589.08s]  He heard you walk
[8589.08s -> 8591.08s]  No, hide
[8591.08s -> 8593.08s]  Where am I hiding?
[8593.08s -> 8595.08s]  What the fuck was that?
[8595.08s -> 8597.26s]  What did you do?
[8597.26s -> 8599.43s]  What happened?
[8599.43s -> 8603.91s]  What did you do?
[8603.91s -> 8605.91s]  What?
[8605.91s -> 8608.34s]  You gotta keep an eye on these cameras
[8608.34s -> 8610.34s]  There's three people coming for you
[8610.34s -> 8612.34s]  Run
[8612.34s -> 8614.34s]  Where am I running to?
[8614.34s -> 8616.34s]  Right
[8616.34s -> 8618.34s]  I don't know where to run to
[8618.34s -> 8620.90s]  I'm gonna hide in here
[8620.90s -> 8622.90s]  Stop there
[8622.90s -> 8624.90s]  There's a guy coming in for you
[8624.90s -> 8626.90s]  Three people are coming in here right now
[8626.90s -> 8628.90s]  No, he's marked as three
[8628.90s -> 8631.59s]  Three is close to you
[8631.59s -> 8633.59s]  They're walking away
[8633.59s -> 8635.59s]  By the way, I'm holding down G
[8635.59s -> 8637.59s]  I have to let go of this and throw this at some point
[8637.59s -> 8639.59s]  I can't let go
[8639.59s -> 8641.59s]  I can't
[8641.59s -> 8643.59s]  Open the door
[8643.59s -> 8645.59s]  Throw it that way
[8645.59s -> 8647.59s]  Oh no
[8647.59s -> 8649.59s]  I have to let go of G to open the door with E
[8649.59s -> 8651.59s]  So I'm going to flashbang myself
[8653.59s -> 8655.59s]  Two is right there
[8657.59s -> 8659.59s]  I can't even open the door
[8661.59s -> 8663.59s]  I'm stuck in here
[8663.59s -> 8665.59s]  What?
[8668.02s -> 8670.02s]  Throw another one
[8670.02s -> 8673.74s]  Can I take...
[8673.74s -> 8676.49s]  Give me hammer
[8676.49s -> 8678.49s]  Why did they hammer this guy in the head?
[8678.49s -> 8680.49s]  I want the hammer so bad
[8680.49s -> 8682.49s]  I don't know, how would you not know I'm behind you?
[8682.49s -> 8684.49s]  I'm trying to reach for your desk hammer
[8684.49s -> 8686.49s]  I'm trying to get his hammer off his desk
[8688.49s -> 8690.49s]  Are you serious, dude?
[8704.15s -> 8706.15s]  Oh god, what the fuck
[8706.15s -> 8708.15s]  What?
[8708.15s -> 8711.03s]  I love this game
[8711.03s -> 8713.03s]  Alright, hold on
[8713.03s -> 8715.03s]  Hack his computer while he's on it
[8715.03s -> 8717.03s]  I've already hacked his computer
[8717.03s -> 8719.03s]  I'm on his computer
[8719.03s -> 8721.03s]  I'm looking at his emails
[8723.03s -> 8725.03s]  Let me hold your mouse and browse your emails
[8725.03s -> 8727.03s]  Thanks, dude
[8727.03s -> 8729.03s]  I appreciate it
[8729.03s -> 8731.03s]  He's going for the desk hammer
[8731.03s -> 8733.03s]  Is he going for the desk hammer?
[8733.03s -> 8737.45s]  It was self-defense
[8739.45s -> 8741.45s]  So there's a guy here
[8741.45s -> 8743.45s]  If I can get three and at least the guy next to three
[8743.45s -> 8745.45s]  Mark the guy next to three
[8745.45s -> 8747.45s]  I'm going to flash him
[8747.45s -> 8749.45s]  I can only have three marked at a time
[8749.45s -> 8751.45s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me
[8753.45s -> 8755.45s]  Turn around, open door
[8755.45s -> 8757.45s]  Door on your right, open that door
[8757.45s -> 8759.45s]  Door right, open it
[8759.45s -> 8761.45s]  This guy sees you down the hallway, keep going
[8761.45s -> 8763.45s]  Open this door
[8763.45s -> 8765.62s]  Don't leave
[8765.62s -> 8767.62s]  Wait, wait, guy at the end of the hallway
[8767.62s -> 8769.62s]  Run out of this door, there's a door on your right
[8769.62s -> 8771.62s]  Got it
[8773.62s -> 8775.62s]  There's a camera in this room
[8775.62s -> 8777.62s]  That guy's checking the wrong room for you
[8777.62s -> 8779.62s]  Turn to your right, there's a door
[8779.62s -> 8781.62s]  Door
[8781.62s -> 8783.62s]  No, no
[8783.62s -> 8785.86s]  Go back
[8785.86s -> 8787.86s]  Go back in the room
[8787.86s -> 8789.86s]  There's a door in front of you, to your right
[8789.86s -> 8791.86s]  Right door, go
[8791.86s -> 8793.86s]  What do I do?
[8793.86s -> 8796.55s]  What do I do?
[8796.55s -> 8798.55s]  Forward, forward, forward
[8798.55s -> 8800.55s]  You got it
[8800.55s -> 8802.55s]  Keep going, keep going
[8802.55s -> 8804.73s]  Right
[8804.73s -> 8806.73s]  Get in
[8806.73s -> 8808.73s]  Turn, turn, turn, turn
[8808.73s -> 8810.73s]  In this room
[8810.73s -> 8812.73s]  There's a guy in here, shoot him in the face
[8812.73s -> 8814.73s]  Shoot him
[8814.73s -> 8817.35s]  He's still alive
[8817.35s -> 8819.35s]  Run forward
[8819.35s -> 8821.35s]  They're on your tail
[8821.35s -> 8823.35s]  Door on your left
[8823.35s -> 8825.35s]  Get in there, double door
[8825.35s -> 8827.35s]  Straight in front
[8827.35s -> 8829.35s]  Shoot, shoot, shoot
[8829.35s -> 8831.35s]  Keep going, keep going, keep going
[8831.35s -> 8833.35s]  There's going to be a door on your left
[8833.35s -> 8835.35s]  Open it up, run to that
[8835.35s -> 8837.35s]  There's going to be a guy around this corner
[8837.35s -> 8839.35s]  You're going to want to kill him, turn this corner, shoot him in the face
[8839.35s -> 8841.35s]  You got it, captain
[8841.35s -> 8843.35s]  In his face
[8843.35s -> 8845.35s]  Open this door, there's going to be three guys and you're going to die
[8845.35s -> 8847.35s]  So immediately turn left, double door
[8847.35s -> 8849.35s]  Hold on, let me just open the door with my
[8849.35s -> 8851.35s]  What the fuck is that?
[8851.35s -> 8853.35s]  You got it
[8853.35s -> 8855.35s]  Forward, forward, forward
[8855.35s -> 8857.35s]  Right, right, right door
[8857.35s -> 8859.35s]  On that door
[8859.35s -> 8861.35s]  Double door
[8861.35s -> 8864.17s]  Shoot him in the face
[8864.17s -> 8866.17s]  Ignore him, keep going
[8868.17s -> 8870.17s]  Turn around, there's a man behind you
[8870.17s -> 8872.17s]  Fire
[8872.17s -> 8876.71s]  Motherfucker
[8878.71s -> 8880.71s]  Run, run straight down the hallway
[8880.71s -> 8882.71s]  Just page him
[8882.71s -> 8884.71s]  Page him
[8884.71s -> 8886.71s]  Ready for Groundhog Day Agent Smith
[8886.71s -> 8888.71s]  Stop, stop staying in this room
[8888.71s -> 8890.71s]  Kill the guy following you
[8890.71s -> 8892.71s]  Kill the guy following you
[8892.71s -> 8894.71s]  He's about to come out, it's marked
[8894.71s -> 8896.71s]  That was the right guy
[8896.71s -> 8898.71s]  He's looking at the wall
[8898.71s -> 8900.71s]  Get this man, that's important, crucial
[8900.71s -> 8902.71s]  Okay, there's a door right here
[8902.71s -> 8904.71s]  Right here, there's a stairwell
[8904.71s -> 8906.71s]  Down here, I want you to get downstairs
[8906.71s -> 8908.71s]  You got it
[8908.71s -> 8910.71s]  Open door, come out this door, come out this door
[8910.71s -> 8912.71s]  Double door
[8912.71s -> 8914.71s]  End
[8914.71s -> 8916.71s]  Okay, keep running forward
[8916.71s -> 8918.71s]  Which one?
[8918.71s -> 8920.71s]  Snickers, snickers, snickers
[8920.71s -> 8922.71s]  Alright
[8922.71s -> 8924.71s]  You're gonna want to go kill him
[8924.71s -> 8926.71s]  Oh my god, I can't, hold on
[8926.71s -> 8929.08s]  He wants your snickers
[8929.08s -> 8932.58s]  Got him?
[8932.58s -> 8934.58s]  He's got him
[8934.58s -> 8936.58s]  Okay, run through that doorway
[8936.58s -> 8938.58s]  There's a guy back there in the cafeteria
[8938.58s -> 8941.21s]  Those are couches
[8941.21s -> 8943.21s]  This is so bad
[8943.21s -> 8945.21s]  Double door
[8945.21s -> 8947.38s]  Which one, just two double doors
[8947.38s -> 8949.38s]  This one, no, other one
[8949.38s -> 8951.38s]  Back, back, back, back
[8951.38s -> 8953.38s]  Get in there
[8955.38s -> 8957.38s]  Hide in this room, hide in the corner
[8957.38s -> 8959.38s]  Hide in the corner, behind the door
[8963.38s -> 8967.10s]  Ow, my mouth
[8967.10s -> 8969.10s]  Oh
[8969.10s -> 8971.10s]  Alright, I'm done
[8971.10s -> 8973.10s]  Seriously
[8973.10s -> 8975.10s]  This has happened so many times
[8975.10s -> 8979.26s]  That was a lot of fun
[8979.26s -> 8984.81s]  God
[8984.81s -> 8986.81s]  The Diablo 3 incident
[8986.81s -> 8988.81s]  Well that's one of Star's videos
[8988.81s -> 8995.72s]  That video was so, I was so irritated
[8995.72s -> 9000.20s]  That's like chipped my tooth
[9000.20s -> 9003.08s]  That was just a hair in my mouth
[9003.08s -> 9009.29s]  Weird, how
[9009.29s -> 9011.29s]  The Diablo 3 incident
[9011.29s -> 9013.66s]  Was, here's the story behind this
[9013.66s -> 9015.66s]  And I don't know if Star gave you this lore or not
[9015.66s -> 9018.34s]  I don't think he did
[9018.34s -> 9021.80s]  This is called
[9021.80s -> 9023.80s]  When you get desperate to make a video
[9023.80s -> 9027.13s]  And you don't have anything done
[9027.13s -> 9029.62s]  This is kind of how this happens
[9029.62s -> 9032.06s]  And why can I not find this video
[9032.06s -> 9037.11s]  I can't, does this video exist
[9037.11s -> 9039.11s]  Oh it's unlisted it
[9039.11s -> 9043.85s]  Why did he unlist it
[9043.85s -> 9050.06s]  Was he embarrassed over this video
[9050.06s -> 9054.22s]  He's embarrassed of me
[9054.22s -> 9065.80s]  What did I do in this video
[9065.80s -> 9067.80s]  This video has like 700,000 views
[9067.80s -> 9072.54s]  I don't think unlisting it did very much
[9072.54s -> 9074.54s]  Oh yeah it did
[9074.54s -> 9088.42s]  Did very much
[9088.42s -> 9090.42s]  Doesn't he just follow me around and go like
[9090.42s -> 9092.42s]  Blah, blah, blah
[9092.42s -> 9097.10s]  How long is this video
[9097.10s -> 9102.15s]  You guys want me to watch this one
[9102.15s -> 9106.38s]  Star's here right now, Star what's going on here
[9106.38s -> 9108.38s]  Devil freak, devil freak, devil freak, devil freak
[9108.38s -> 9110.38s]  Devil shoot, devil freak, devil freak, devil freak
[9110.38s -> 9112.38s]  So he can make Jerma is mad part Diablo
[9112.38s -> 9114.38s]  Which like, who
[9114.38s -> 9116.38s]  Why would you make that video in the first place
[9116.38s -> 9118.38s]  You know go ahead and make it
[9118.38s -> 9120.38s]  Make Jerma is mad part Diablo
[9120.38s -> 9122.38s]  It's gonna suck, it'll be like the worst video you've ever made
[9122.38s -> 9124.38s]  You're just jealous because I get all the women
[9124.38s -> 9127.19s]  And it's unlisted
[9127.19s -> 9133.21s]  And the video is unlisted
[9133.21s -> 9135.21s]  You know
[9135.21s -> 9137.21s]  Look at me and Leia over here
[9137.21s -> 9139.21s]  Let's talk about
[9139.21s -> 9141.21s]  The temple, no your childhood
[9141.21s -> 9143.21s]  I don't care
[9143.21s -> 9145.21s]  You know which doctor has right now
[9145.21s -> 9147.21s]  What
[9147.21s -> 9149.21s]  Oh you're gonna
[9149.21s -> 9151.21s]  Make me die
[9151.21s -> 9153.21s]  Oh
[9153.21s -> 9155.21s]  I'm assuming
[9155.21s -> 9157.21s]  I'm assuming you're happy you made a fucking witch doctor
[9157.21s -> 9159.21s]  No
[9159.21s -> 9161.21s]  I'm not playing Diablo
[9161.21s -> 9163.21s]  You're playing annoy Jerma
[9163.21s -> 9165.21s]  It's your favorite past time

[9175.90s -> 9177.90s]  No mana
[9177.90s -> 9180.71s]  Blah, blah

[9203.83s -> 9205.83s]  When you see
[9205.83s -> 9207.83s]  The stolen ring
[9207.83s -> 9209.83s]  Wonder why you had it
[9209.83s -> 9211.83s]  Oh my god
[9211.83s -> 9213.83s]  Does this have vitality and
[9213.83s -> 9215.83s]  Intelligence on it
[9215.83s -> 9217.83s]  What a unique item
[9217.83s -> 9219.83s]  This game is so bad
[9219.83s -> 9222.46s]  Mela
[9222.46s -> 9224.46s]  Wanna come play Diablo?
[9224.46s -> 9226.46s]  Wanna come play CS?

[9230.46s -> 9232.46s]  And then after that maybe you can play with me
[9232.46s -> 9234.46s]  I'm in the middle of something important
[9234.46s -> 9236.46s]  He's not in the middle
[9236.46s -> 9238.46s]  Of something important
[9238.46s -> 9240.63s]  This is important for me
[9240.63s -> 9242.63s]  Come here
[9242.63s -> 9244.63s]  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
[9244.63s -> 9246.63s]  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
[9246.63s -> 9250.33s]  I'm gonna get you
[9250.33s -> 9252.33s]  I am gonna get you, I'm a fucking wizard
[9252.33s -> 9254.33s]  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
[9254.33s -> 9257.98s]  Yeah you think that's gonna keep you safe
[9257.98s -> 9259.98s]  You fucking piece of shit
[9259.98s -> 9261.98s]  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
[9261.98s -> 9263.98s]  What the fuck
[9263.98s -> 9267.30s]  This is so weird
[9267.30s -> 9269.30s]  Okay I'm fucking done with that
[9269.30s -> 9271.30s]  I'm so done with that
[9271.30s -> 9273.30s]  This isn't fun
[9273.30s -> 9275.30s]  This isn't the most fun you've had
[9275.30s -> 9277.30s]  In Diablo 3
[9277.30s -> 9279.30s]  I'm done with that
[9279.30s -> 9282.38s]  This is the Halls of Agony
[9282.38s -> 9284.38s]  You know what happens in the Halls of Agony
[9284.38s -> 9286.38s]  This is not my video
[9286.38s -> 9288.81s]  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
[9288.81s -> 9290.81s]  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
[9290.81s -> 9292.81s]  Alright Mela
[9292.81s -> 9294.81s]  I'm gonna have to ask you to stop for 3 seconds sir
[9294.81s -> 9296.81s]  Mela you need to do like
[9296.81s -> 9299.05s]  Just
[9299.05s -> 9301.05s]  A general assessment
[9301.05s -> 9303.29s]  He's following me around
[9303.29s -> 9305.29s]  As a witch doctor
[9305.29s -> 9307.29s]  Completely nude
[9307.29s -> 9309.29s]  Doing this I throw up on you animation
[9309.29s -> 9311.29s]  That comes down in pubes
[9311.29s -> 9313.53s]  And he's making this a video
[9313.53s -> 9315.53s]  Do you like this video so far?
[9315.53s -> 9317.53s]  I think it's pretty dumb
[9317.53s -> 9320.02s]  It's so dumb that I have to mute and mumble
[9320.02s -> 9322.02s]  So I can't play SEA
[9322.02s -> 9325.40s]  Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
[9325.40s -> 9327.83s]  Wiggle
[9327.83s -> 9329.83s]  You see you just like really pissed off Mela
[9329.83s -> 9331.83s]  You know it's great
[9331.83s -> 9333.83s]  It's actually a good thing because you can't revive here
[9333.83s -> 9335.83s]  I can stay alive
[9335.83s -> 9338.26s]  No you can't
[9338.26s -> 9340.26s]  Here I'm gonna help
[9340.26s -> 9342.26s]  You're dying in less than 5 seconds
[9342.26s -> 9344.50s]  Let's count to 5
[9344.50s -> 9346.50s]  And if you're alive in 5 seconds
[9346.50s -> 9348.50s]  Then I owe you a dollar
[9348.50s -> 9350.50s]  One, two
[9350.50s -> 9353.00s]  Shut the fuck up
[9353.00s -> 9355.00s]  I need to know where the guy is
[9355.00s -> 9357.00s]  I'm alive, I'm still alive
[9357.00s -> 9359.00s]  He's fucking having, alright I got him
[9359.00s -> 9361.30s]  God I'm deafening
[9361.30s -> 9364.06s]  This wasn't even up
[9364.06s -> 9366.06s]  This is not gonna get on me
[9366.06s -> 9368.06s]  I tried
[9368.06s -> 9370.06s]  Can I get a revive?
[9370.06s -> 9372.06s]  Can I get a revive?
[9372.06s -> 9374.74s]  No just
[9374.74s -> 9376.74s]  Dude I've never heard him
[9376.74s -> 9378.74s]  scream like that
[9378.74s -> 9380.74s]  Can I get a revive though?
[9380.74s -> 9382.74s]  Alright since you passed the test
[9382.74s -> 9384.74s]  I said
[9384.74s -> 9386.74s]  One dollar
[9386.74s -> 9389.50s]  Count to 5
[9389.50s -> 9391.50s]  And if you stay alive in 5 seconds
[9391.50s -> 9393.50s]  Then I owe you a dollar
[9393.50s -> 9395.50s]  You're not counting
[9395.50s -> 9397.50s]  You're not counting
[9397.50s -> 9399.50s]  One, two
[9399.50s -> 9402.74s]  Shut the fuck up
[9402.74s -> 9404.74s]  I need to know where the guy is
[9404.74s -> 9406.74s]  I'm alive, I'm still alive
[9406.74s -> 9408.74s]  He's fucking having, alright I got him
[9408.74s -> 9411.56s]  Alright we heard that one
[9413.56s -> 9415.56s]  Can I get a revive?
[9415.56s -> 9417.56s]  I'm like seeing through my own eyes
[9417.56s -> 9419.56s]  Can I get a revive?
[9419.56s -> 9421.56s]  I feel myself playing the game
[9421.56s -> 9423.56s]  Dude I've never heard him
[9423.56s -> 9425.56s]  scream like that before
[9425.56s -> 9427.56s]  Can I get a revive though?
[9427.56s -> 9429.56s]  Alright since you passed the test
[9429.56s -> 9431.56s]  You get to get revived
[9431.56s -> 9433.56s]  You did pass the test
[9433.56s -> 9439.83s]  Oh man
[9439.83s -> 9441.83s]  Oh you did
[9441.83s -> 9443.83s]  It's another snake
[9443.83s -> 9446.65s]  Look at the snake
[9446.65s -> 9448.65s]  I am Jon Adventure Man
[9448.65s -> 9450.65s]  Look at the snake, look at the snake
[9450.65s -> 9454.23s]  I need a revive
[9454.23s -> 9459.99s]  You keep enabling me
[9459.99s -> 9462.36s]  I'm glad I have like
[9462.36s -> 9464.36s]  Anchor Star
[9464.36s -> 9466.36s]  It's just driving around the ship with the fucking anchor down
[9466.36s -> 9468.36s]  I've stuck to this for a while
[9468.36s -> 9470.36s]  Yeah you really have
[9470.36s -> 9472.36s]  You've just been being like a pain in the ass
[9472.36s -> 9474.36s]  For the last like hour and fourteen minutes
[9474.36s -> 9476.36s]  Does he have anything else to do?
[9476.36s -> 9478.36s]  No
[9478.36s -> 9480.36s]  Apparently not
[9480.36s -> 9482.36s]  I don't know
[9482.36s -> 9484.73s]  Anyway before you go down into the cellar
[9484.73s -> 9487.16s]  I was supposed to leave and make this game
[9487.16s -> 9489.16s]  Different before like an hour ago
[9489.16s -> 9491.16s]  Have you considered not going into the cellar?
[9491.16s -> 9493.16s]  Because if you go into the cellar
[9493.16s -> 9495.16s]  All of these guys
[9495.16s -> 9497.16s]  Are going to turn into snakes
[9497.16s -> 9499.16s]  If you don't go into the cellar
[9499.16s -> 9501.16s]  They won't ever ever turn into snakes
[9501.16s -> 9503.53s]  He deleted it?
[9503.53s -> 9505.53s]  Wait hold on a second
[9505.53s -> 9507.53s]  This video doesn't exist?
[9507.53s -> 9509.53s]  He deleted the video
[9509.53s -> 9512.34s]  The video is gone
[9512.34s -> 9519.64s]  No he didn't
[9519.64s -> 9521.64s]  It's gone, he deleted it right now
[9521.64s -> 9525.48s]  It's live deleted, why did you do that?
[9525.48s -> 9527.48s]  I'm never closing this video
[9527.48s -> 9530.10s]  I'm never closing this tab ever again
[9530.10s -> 9537.06s]  I'm never turning my computer off
[9537.06s -> 9539.06s]  What the fuck
[9539.06s -> 9541.24s]  Is he in chat right now?
[9541.24s -> 9545.53s]  Why would I write that?
[9545.53s -> 9547.53s]  What am I doing?
[9547.53s -> 9549.53s]  What is this like a discord?
[9549.53s -> 9555.03s]  Why are you here?
[9555.03s -> 9561.37s]  I can't download it
[9561.37s -> 9563.37s]  It doesn't exist anymore, I have it just cached
[9563.37s -> 9565.98s]  Wait a minute
[9565.98s -> 9568.98s]  Guys look at the video
[9568.98s -> 9570.98s]  I think I only have up to this point
[9570.98s -> 9574.42s]  Cached
[9574.42s -> 9579.54s]  Just download this VOD
[9579.54s -> 9586.78s]  Why did you delete it?
[9586.78s -> 9588.78s]  We weren't done
[9588.78s -> 9591.91s]  He said he hates you
[9591.91s -> 9594.09s]  What?
[9594.09s -> 9602.86s]  This is a good video
[9602.86s -> 9606.70s]  Anchor star
[9606.70s -> 9616.62s]  That's not where I wanted to start the video from
[9616.62s -> 9621.03s]  It's just driving around the ship
[9621.03s -> 9623.03s]  With the fucking anchor down
[9623.03s -> 9625.03s]  I've stuck to this for a while
[9625.03s -> 9627.03s]  Yeah you really have
[9627.03s -> 9629.03s]  Here's the best part about this video
[9629.03s -> 9632.55s]  He uploaded this video
[9632.55s -> 9634.92s]  You don't know the fucking balls
[9634.92s -> 9636.92s]  It takes to upload this video
[9636.92s -> 9639.61s]  That's some like real
[9639.61s -> 9641.61s]  That's
[9641.61s -> 9643.91s]  Come on
[9643.91s -> 9649.42s]  There's got to be some respect there
[9649.42s -> 9651.42s]  Being like a pain in the ass for the last
[9651.42s -> 9653.42s]  Hour and fourteen minutes
[9653.42s -> 9655.42s]  Does he have anything else to do?
[9655.42s -> 9657.42s]  He can't play it without
[9657.42s -> 9659.42s]  Apparently not
[9659.42s -> 9661.66s]  I don't know
[9661.66s -> 9663.66s]  Wait before you go down into the cellar
[9663.66s -> 9665.66s]  I was supposed to leave and make this
[9665.66s -> 9667.66s]  Where is he?
[9667.66s -> 9672.65s]  Hold on a minute
[9672.65s -> 9696.44s]  Wait a second
[9696.44s -> 9706.17s]  I'm just checking on something
[9706.17s -> 9711.14s]  I'm asking him
[9711.14s -> 9713.14s]  You want me to defend myself?
[9713.14s -> 9715.14s]  That's not what I meant
[9715.14s -> 9717.14s]  You said defend yourself
[9717.14s -> 9719.14s]  Because you deleted the video
[9719.14s -> 9721.14s]  You're a snake
[9721.14s -> 9723.14s]  On the stream you say
[9723.14s -> 9725.14s]  This is a good video
[9725.14s -> 9727.14s]  In private you want to defend yourself?
[9727.14s -> 9729.14s]  If it's a good video I have nothing to defend
[9729.14s -> 9731.70s]  He's right
[9731.70s -> 9733.70s]  I said hey you want to come in and
[9733.70s -> 9735.88s]  Defend yourself
[9735.88s -> 9738.38s]  Why did you delete it?
[9738.38s -> 9740.55s]  I didn't I privated it
[9740.55s -> 9742.73s]  Why did you do it?
[9742.73s -> 9745.78s]  You want to watch the rest of it?
[9745.78s -> 9747.78s]  I'm at six
[9747.78s -> 9749.78s]  We're committed at this point
[9749.78s -> 9751.78s]  You got to watch eight minutes of me
[9751.78s -> 9753.78s]  I can't believe watching this back
[9753.78s -> 9755.78s]  I have blocked this from my memory since I uploaded it
[9755.78s -> 9757.78s]  I can't believe you got to act too
[9757.78s -> 9759.78s]  While I was doing this
[9759.78s -> 9761.78s]  I'm not wearing gear
[9761.78s -> 9763.78s]  I know
[9763.78s -> 9766.54s]  Why do you think it was so frustrating?
[9766.54s -> 9769.61s]  Why was this on?
[9769.61s -> 9771.61s]  It says Torment 1 at the top right
[9771.61s -> 9775.64s]  Really? I must have been in some pretty good shit
[9775.64s -> 9777.64s]  This is Star by the way
[9777.64s -> 9779.64s]  This is the guy
[9779.64s -> 9781.64s]  I'm the guy in this video
[9781.64s -> 9783.64s]  Ready? Listen
[9783.64s -> 9785.64s]  Consider for a second
[9785.64s -> 9787.64s]  Have you considered not going into the cellar?
[9787.64s -> 9789.88s]  That's him
[9789.88s -> 9791.88s]  We got a live interview with the guy that
[9791.88s -> 9795.45s]  Uploaded this video
[9795.45s -> 9797.45s]  If you want any pro tips on becoming a
[9797.45s -> 9799.45s]  Successful YouTuber now would be the chance
[9799.45s -> 9801.45s]  To ask those questions
[9803.75s -> 9807.02s]  I'm making myself nice and big here
[9807.02s -> 9809.02s]  Questions
[9809.02s -> 9811.02s]  For a YouTuber
[9811.02s -> 9813.26s]  When was the last video that you uploaded?
[9815.69s -> 9817.69s]  The Netflix video that you promised
[9817.69s -> 9819.69s]  That you would watch, you never responded to me
[9819.69s -> 9821.69s]  And then did a video watching stream
[9821.69s -> 9824.12s]  And still didn't watch it
[9824.12s -> 9826.42s]  I watched it after I told you that
[9826.42s -> 9828.42s]  I guess you had a lot to say about it
[9828.42s -> 9835.91s]  I saw the video
[9835.91s -> 9838.54s]  I saw the video
[9838.54s -> 9840.90s]  I can even quote you pieces of that video
[9840.90s -> 9842.90s]  In private
[9842.90s -> 9844.90s]  Okay after this you can quote
[9844.90s -> 9846.90s]  After this I'll quote the video
[9846.90s -> 9848.90s]  Okay we'll see
[9848.90s -> 9850.90s]  But first of all
[9850.90s -> 9852.90s]  My last video was 20 years ago
[9852.90s -> 9854.90s]  What was your last video?
[9854.90s -> 9856.90s]  Defend yourself
[9856.90s -> 9859.72s]  Okay
[9859.72s -> 9861.72s]  Like a million views on YouTube was worth like
[9861.72s -> 9863.72s]  $64 now
[9863.72s -> 9866.09s]  I thought you were going to say 64 viewers on Twitch
[9866.09s -> 9869.29s]  It's about accurate
[9869.29s -> 9872.62s]  It's about accurate
[9872.62s -> 9876.78s]  64
[9876.78s -> 9879.02s]  And Twitch was just more fun
[9879.02s -> 9882.79s]  At the time
[9882.79s -> 9884.79s]  64 viewers
[9884.79s -> 9886.79s]  I haven't been paid by YouTube since April
[9886.79s -> 9889.27s]  Really?
[9889.27s -> 9892.22s]  Wait
[9892.22s -> 9894.22s]  Maybe March actually
[9894.22s -> 9896.22s]  How does that make any sense?
[9896.22s -> 9899.16s]  It was all about the money
[9901.16s -> 9903.16s]  Before we play the rest of the video
[9903.16s -> 9905.16s]  When you say the word
[9905.16s -> 9907.16s]  For instance
[9907.16s -> 9909.16s]  Are you watching this right?
[9909.16s -> 9911.16s]  You probably have it muted or something right?
[9911.16s -> 9913.16s]  Yeah it's muted
[9913.16s -> 9915.16s]  So anytime you say the word money
[9915.16s -> 9919.16s]  Does that happen to you when you do that?
[9919.16s -> 9921.16s]  Your neck?
[9921.16s -> 9923.16s]  No just say money
[9923.16s -> 9925.16s]  Money
[9925.16s -> 9927.16s]  I can't do it without having a fucking mean face
[9927.16s -> 9929.66s]  No that's just you
[9929.66s -> 9933.11s]  Money
[9933.11s -> 9935.48s]  Are you ready?
[9935.48s -> 9937.66s]  Because if you go into the cellar
[9937.66s -> 9939.66s]  All of these guys are going to turn into snakes
[9939.66s -> 9941.66s]  If you don't go into the cellar
[9941.66s -> 9943.66s]  They won't ever
[9943.66s -> 9947.11s]  So Phil cue the video up then
[9947.11s -> 9949.11s]  I'm at 5 minutes and 39 seconds
[9949.11s -> 9951.11s]  It's your video
[9951.11s -> 9953.61s]  It's not like
[9953.61s -> 9955.61s]  Hey by the way
[9955.61s -> 9957.61s]  Why am I doing the out the window thing
[9957.61s -> 9959.61s]  The train like stop
[9959.61s -> 9964.34s]  Take it
[9964.34s -> 9966.65s]  You're going to get to 5 minutes and 39 seconds
[9966.65s -> 9968.65s]  I'm there
[9968.65s -> 9970.65s]  Are you at 5 minutes and 39 seconds?
[9970.65s -> 9972.65s]  Yep
[9972.65s -> 9974.65s]  Okay 3, 2, 1 play
[9974.65s -> 9979.32s]  Ever turn into snakes
[9979.32s -> 9982.46s]  We've been discovered
[9982.46s -> 9984.46s]  See this all could have been avoided
[9984.46s -> 9986.46s]  Is that shitty joke over?
[9986.46s -> 9988.46s]  No
[9988.46s -> 9990.46s]  It's not he fucking is still going
[9990.46s -> 9993.40s]  Alright I'm eating them
[9995.40s -> 9997.40s]  This is turning more into like Mela is mad
[9997.40s -> 9999.40s]  Than it is anything else
[9999.40s -> 10001.40s]  I walked completely backwards
[10001.40s -> 10003.40s]  Did we walk back here?
[10003.40s -> 10005.40s]  I'm getting the fuck out of here
[10005.40s -> 10008.15s]  No
[10008.15s -> 10010.15s]  I was supposed to be done with this
[10010.15s -> 10012.15s]  By now
[10012.15s -> 10014.15s]  I'm fucking getting that right
[10016.78s -> 10018.78s]  You're not getting in here
[10018.78s -> 10020.78s]  Unless you're on a real character
[10020.78s -> 10022.78s]  Okay just so you would wonder
[10022.78s -> 10024.78s]  I'm not looking at the chat anymore
[10024.78s -> 10026.78s]  I'm like not even paying attention to it anymore
[10026.78s -> 10028.78s]  Pause it
[10028.78s -> 10032.04s]  What are you saying?
[10032.04s -> 10034.78s]  I'm saying
[10034.78s -> 10036.78s]  Like 2 weeks after I uploaded this
[10036.78s -> 10038.78s]  I was already regretting it
[10038.78s -> 10040.78s]  I don't remember exactly when I unlisted
[10040.78s -> 10043.59s]  But it was fast
[10043.59s -> 10045.59s]  Did you actually
[10045.59s -> 10047.59s]  This video has a lot of views to get unlisted after a week
[10047.59s -> 10049.59s]  Because people keep
[10049.59s -> 10051.59s]  You know it's
[10051.59s -> 10054.92s]  It has it's own life now
[10054.92s -> 10056.92s]  The video I never once
[10056.92s -> 10058.92s]  Published the definition of
[10058.92s -> 10060.92s]  A German joke video
[10060.92s -> 10064.18s]  That's crazy
[10064.18s -> 10066.49s]  You said you'd always be there
[10066.49s -> 10068.49s]  Now look at us, I can't even look into your eyes
[10068.49s -> 10070.49s]  It's rough, I don't do drugs, it's called emotions
[10070.49s -> 10072.49s]  Don't be so defensive, let's sort this out
[10072.49s -> 10074.49s]  My witch doctor bit is genius, can we agree to look?
[10074.49s -> 10076.49s]  If I didn't do all the things I've done
[10076.49s -> 10078.49s]  Then where would you have to do it?
[10078.49s -> 10080.49s]  What?
[10080.49s -> 10082.49s]  What does that even mean?
[10082.49s -> 10084.49s]  If I didn't do all the things I've done
[10084.49s -> 10087.88s]  Then where would you have to do it?
[10087.88s -> 10089.88s]  Oh because I wouldn't let you in the game
[10089.88s -> 10091.88s]  You ready?
[10091.88s -> 10093.88s]  One, two, three, go
[10093.88s -> 10095.88s]  Get the fuck away from me
[10095.88s -> 10098.18s]  Will you leave me alone?
[10098.18s -> 10100.81s]  Alright
[10100.81s -> 10103.05s]  Alright, alright, alright
[10103.05s -> 10105.05s]  If I invite this
[10105.05s -> 10107.05s]  If I invite you right now and you come in on the witch doctor
[10107.05s -> 10109.05s]  I'm leaving the game and I'm blocking
[10109.05s -> 10114.55s]  Ster's account
[10114.55s -> 10122.36s]  What are you doing?
[10122.36s -> 10124.54s]  Why are you not talking?
[10124.54s -> 10130.17s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[10130.17s -> 10134.44s]  Can I get a revive?
[10134.44s -> 10138.41s]  Revive
[10138.41s -> 10140.41s]  Move her
[10140.41s -> 10143.42s]  It was like full, like a minute
[10158.49s -> 10160.49s]  Where'd you go?
[10160.49s -> 10163.37s]  What?
[10163.37s -> 10165.37s]  Where do I do this?
[10165.37s -> 10168.38s]  My game's crashing
[10168.38s -> 10170.38s]  My game is legitimately crashing
[10170.38s -> 10172.38s]  You've crashed my fucking game
[10172.38s -> 10174.38s]  What's the point of this video?
[10174.38s -> 10179.62s]  Holy shit
[10183.13s -> 10185.13s]  Your whispers actually broke my game
[10185.13s -> 10188.26s]  Okay, I have to look up
[10188.26s -> 10190.26s]  When Diablo 3 came out
[10190.26s -> 10192.26s]  What's the next call upstream we're going to do?
[10192.26s -> 10196.54s]  Oh I don't know
[10196.54s -> 10199.80s]  Play with that guy
[10199.80s -> 10201.80s]  Play Diablo 3
[10201.80s -> 10203.80s]  It came out two years before this video
[10203.80s -> 10205.80s]  So I think yeah, I was just surprised
[10205.80s -> 10207.80s]  You wanted to play Diablo 3
[10207.80s -> 10209.80s]  And I don't know, it probably upset me
[10209.80s -> 10213.77s]  I think this was also before
[10213.77s -> 10215.77s]  Reaper of Souls
[10215.77s -> 10217.77s]  Was that before Reaper of Souls?
[10217.77s -> 10219.77s]  I think so, because in the beginning of the video
[10219.77s -> 10222.01s]  Your whispers were still garbage
[10222.01s -> 10224.01s]  Yeah, why would I have played Diablo 3 again
[10224.01s -> 10226.01s]  I think I was trying to talk you
[10226.01s -> 10228.01s]  Out of playing Diablo before the video started
[10228.01s -> 10230.01s]  That's my guess
[10230.01s -> 10232.01s]  That's me defending myself
[10232.01s -> 10234.95s]  Of why that happened
[10234.95s -> 10236.95s]  Interesting, okay
[10236.95s -> 10242.94s]  Interesting
[10242.94s -> 10246.14s]  What are you up to this week?
[10246.14s -> 10248.50s]  You know, nothing
[10248.50s -> 10251.83s]  Is there anything fun we could ever do?
[10251.83s -> 10254.52s]  I don't think so
[10254.52s -> 10257.45s]  Alright, we'll see you in a year
[10257.45s -> 10262.57s]  Okay
[10262.57s -> 10266.20s]  You coming over?
[10266.20s -> 10268.20s]  I don't think so
[10268.20s -> 10270.20s]  I don't think it's going to happen
[10270.20s -> 10272.82s]  You're not coming over
[10272.82s -> 10274.82s]  I don't think so
[10274.82s -> 10276.82s]  Really, we're talking about cryptic behind the scenes
[10276.82s -> 10278.82s]  Discord, defend yourself shit going on here
[10278.82s -> 10280.82s]  You don't think it's not going to happen?
[10280.82s -> 10282.82s]  I don't think it's going to happen
[10282.82s -> 10284.82s]  When it was planned to happen
[10284.82s -> 10286.82s]  I still want to get out there
[10286.82s -> 10289.00s]  But not
[10289.00s -> 10291.18s]  That's alright
[10291.18s -> 10294.18s]  Well, it would have been great to see you
[10294.18s -> 10298.97s]  Yeah
[10298.97s -> 10301.46s]  It would have been good to see you
[10301.46s -> 10303.46s]  Yeah, I'll let you get back to your stream
[10303.46s -> 10305.77s]  I don't have very much left because I have to go to the doctor
[10305.77s -> 10308.39s]  Oh, I can come
[10308.39s -> 10310.70s]  Are you going to come to the doctor with me?
[10310.70s -> 10313.45s]  I mean, if you need someone
[10313.45s -> 10315.45s]  Let's play something, like this week or something
[10315.45s -> 10317.86s]  We'll figure it out, we'll get something fucked
[10317.86s -> 10319.86s]  Okay
[10319.86s -> 10323.58s]  Alright, that was twitch.tv slash stir
[10323.58s -> 10325.58s]  Get check him out
[10325.58s -> 10328.65s]  He's got great fucking videos
[10328.65s -> 10335.18s]  You got anything else to say before you leave?
[10335.18s -> 10337.18s]  Quote the video
[10337.18s -> 10339.18s]  Why do you have to like leave?
[10339.18s -> 10341.18s]  I don't know
[10341.18s -> 10343.18s]  Why am I saying bye to you?
[10343.18s -> 10345.18s]  You were saying like it was nice to see you
[10345.18s -> 10347.18s]  You're so busy, your stream's going so well
[10347.18s -> 10349.18s]  And then I came on
[10349.18s -> 10351.18s]  And now it's like I'm sorry to interrupt
[10351.18s -> 10353.18s]  I'm like trying to like shoe him off the stage
[10353.18s -> 10355.18s]  Like alright, well that was fun
[10355.18s -> 10357.18s]  I mean, we should all just
[10357.18s -> 10359.18s]  We could all just watch videos
[10359.18s -> 10361.18s]  We could
[10361.18s -> 10365.06s]  Okay, you got one?
[10365.06s -> 10367.06s]  I don't know what you have and have not watched on your stream
[10367.06s -> 10369.06s]  Throw us some out
[10369.06s -> 10371.99s]  Did you watch handball showdown?
[10371.99s -> 10373.99s]  I did
[10373.99s -> 10375.99s]  I think you did
[10375.99s -> 10377.99s]  Wait, no, did I? I did
[10377.99s -> 10379.99s]  I know that I did on my stream
[10379.99s -> 10381.99s]  That video is one of those
[10381.99s -> 10383.99s]  Oh, by the way, we talked about
[10383.99s -> 10385.99s]  A little bit
[10385.99s -> 10387.99s]  How many videos do you think that you made that you never uploaded
[10387.99s -> 10389.99s]  That you never saw the light of day
[10389.99s -> 10391.99s]  That you wish you like saved in a folder
[10391.99s -> 10393.99s]  So like this year you could like just watch them
[10393.99s -> 10395.99s]  I can tell you
[10395.99s -> 10397.99s]  That I have some videos I never uploaded
[10397.99s -> 10399.99s]  That I'm so glad
[10399.99s -> 10401.99s]  That you never did?
[10401.99s -> 10403.99s]  I only very recently deleted
[10403.99s -> 10405.99s]  When me and you played Half Life 1 together
[10405.99s -> 10411.54s]  Oh
[10411.54s -> 10414.62s]  Do you remember? I do
[10414.62s -> 10416.62s]  Wait, you, you, you
[10416.62s -> 10418.62s]  You like deleted all that
[10418.62s -> 10420.62s]  I had like the footage of it
[10420.62s -> 10422.62s]  And it was like unedited raw footage
[10422.62s -> 10424.62s]  So it was like 30 gigabytes of footage of us playing
[10424.62s -> 10426.62s]  So I finally was like I need the space
[10426.62s -> 10428.62s]  This is, I'm never doing, I'm never going to look at this again
[10428.62s -> 10434.04s]  That's unfortunate
[10434.04s -> 10436.04s]  Yeah
[10436.04s -> 10438.04s]  But no, I've done that quite a few times
[10438.04s -> 10440.04s]  Remember when we played that game where we weren't talking at all
[10440.04s -> 10443.88s]  But our characters, it was like text to speech
[10443.88s -> 10446.31s]  The game where you're on a boat
[10446.31s -> 10448.31s]  It's like a murder mystery
[10448.31s -> 10450.68s]  Vaguely
[10450.68s -> 10452.68s]  Oh yeah, you didn't upload that?
[10452.68s -> 10454.86s]  No, I didn't upload it because it was too
[10454.86s -> 10456.86s]  We didn't talk, there's no dialogue
[10456.86s -> 10458.86s]  It's just you and me giggling to ourselves
[10458.86s -> 10460.86s]  It was unedited while our characters say stupid shit to people
[10460.86s -> 10465.14s]  I don't know why
[10465.14s -> 10467.14s]  I wish it was there because I'm having a hard time remembering
[10467.14s -> 10470.60s]  Yeah, well I didn't
[10470.60s -> 10472.60s]  I don't have it anymore, that's what I'm saying
[10472.60s -> 10474.60s]  I wish I still had some of these old videos
[10474.60s -> 10477.16s]  That never saw the light of day
[10477.16s -> 10479.85s]  Alright, but what do you got, do you got anything for us?
[10479.85s -> 10482.28s]  Did you watch Dastardly Devil Boy?
[10482.28s -> 10484.97s]  Dastardly Devil Boy?
[10484.97s -> 10489.05s]  No
[10489.05s -> 10491.05s]  I forget what the games are called
[10491.05s -> 10494.38s]  Lucius? Lucius, yeah
[10494.38s -> 10497.26s]  Is that a star pick?
[10497.26s -> 10499.26s]  I'm trying to pick from your videos
[10499.26s -> 10502.44s]  And that was a good one
[10502.44s -> 10504.44s]  As I recall
[10504.44s -> 10511.99s]  Let's watch Dastardly Devil Boy
[10511.99s -> 10518.70s]  It's a fun remembering thing
[10518.70s -> 10521.94s]  You tell me when you're ready
[10521.94s -> 10523.94s]  I am ready
[10523.94s -> 10526.18s]  I am also ready, but not quite
[10526.18s -> 10528.62s]  Ready?
[10528.62s -> 10531.05s]  I'm sorry
[10531.05s -> 10533.05s]  3, 2, 1, play
[10533.05s -> 10538.98s]  That's a sick intro
[10538.98s -> 10542.42s]  Father, father
[10542.42s -> 10544.42s]  When can I go and play with the puppies daddy
[10544.42s -> 10546.42s]  I'm Lucius
[10546.42s -> 10548.42s]  I'm such a bad boy, such a bad bad boy
[10548.42s -> 10550.42s]  I'm Lucius
[10550.42s -> 10552.42s]  I'm gonna kill you
[10552.42s -> 10555.50s]  What?
[10555.50s -> 10560.98s]  What?
[10560.98s -> 10562.98s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[10562.98s -> 10571.22s]  Okay, now I remember why
[10571.22s -> 10573.22s]  This guy was just trying to get me
[10573.22s -> 10575.22s]  And yell at me and stuff
[10575.22s -> 10577.22s]  And now he's just marveling at the sink
[10577.22s -> 10579.22s]  We're gonna try this
[10579.22s -> 10581.22s]  Hello
[10581.22s -> 10583.22s]  I'm taking you to the authorities
[10583.22s -> 10585.22s]  Yes, please
[10585.22s -> 10588.04s]  Take me to the authorities
[10588.04s -> 10590.04s]  You would seriously think that after doing this like 15 to 16 times
[10590.04s -> 10592.04s]  This guy would look down and be like
[10592.04s -> 10594.04s]  I shouldn't walk on the green shit
[10594.04s -> 10596.04s]  No, of course not
[10596.04s -> 10599.30s]  Murder
[10599.30s -> 10601.30s]  Murder
[10601.30s -> 10603.30s]  Hello nurse, hey what's going on
[10603.30s -> 10605.30s]  I'm Lucius
[10605.30s -> 10607.30s]  I'm gonna take over your fucking mind
[10607.30s -> 10609.30s]  I'm Lucius
[10609.30s -> 10611.30s]  I'm gonna go walk into a
[10611.30s -> 10616.23s]  I'm scared
[10618.23s -> 10620.23s]  Ah
[10629.77s -> 10631.77s]  What am I seeing
[10631.77s -> 10633.94s]  Dude, I'm like a supernatural
[10633.94s -> 10635.94s]  Psycho dragging her on a bookshelf
[10635.94s -> 10638.31s]  What do you mean what am I seeing
[10638.31s -> 10640.94s]  Do you know there's another one of these
[10640.94s -> 10643.30s]  Oh yeah, did you play it?
[10643.30s -> 10645.30s]  No, apparently it sucks
[10645.30s -> 10647.30s]  What the fuck is this
[10647.30s -> 10649.30s]  Pick up those shaggy butts, pick up those shaggy butts
[10649.30s -> 10653.08s]  She actually did
[10653.08s -> 10655.08s]  She just took them, what?
[10655.08s -> 10658.60s]  All those cigarettes
[10658.60s -> 10660.60s]  I clearly threw those on the ground
[10660.60s -> 10662.60s]  So now
[10662.60s -> 10664.60s]  I'm gonna fucking can ya
[10664.60s -> 10666.60s]  What's this, I'm gonna fucking can ya
[10666.60s -> 10668.60s]  You wanna get canned? You ever been to Kansas?
[10668.60s -> 10670.84s]  I'm gonna fucking can ya
[10670.84s -> 10673.21s]  This lady keeps ducking
[10673.21s -> 10675.21s]  This is just psychic hit man
[10675.21s -> 10677.21s]  Invisible food? I love invisible food
[10677.21s -> 10679.21s]  What's the guy on the left, what's he doing here
[10679.21s -> 10681.21s]  Just wearing that nice shirt
[10681.21s -> 10683.21s]  Fucking naked guy
[10683.21s -> 10694.84s]  I forgot about this part
[10694.84s -> 10697.78s]  He's gonna have a lot of trouble
[10699.78s -> 10701.78s]  What the fuck
[10701.78s -> 10704.60s]  He dropped it
[10704.60s -> 10706.60s]  You're not even doing anything
[10706.60s -> 10710.95s]  You dropped it dude
[10710.95s -> 10712.95s]  Without context, this is really strange
[10712.95s -> 10717.05s]  What's this guy's story
[10717.05s -> 10719.05s]  I wanna know his full story
[10719.05s -> 10722.25s]  Yeah, your arm's gonna be fine
[10722.25s -> 10724.25s]  Don't worry, we're in a hospital right now
[10724.25s -> 10726.25s]  You're probably here for surgery or something
[10726.25s -> 10728.25s]  Let me get you to your emergency room
[10728.25s -> 10730.25s]  Surgery room, jeez
[10730.25s -> 10732.25s]  So on the right here, as you can see
[10732.25s -> 10734.25s]  I'm gonna give you a little quick tour before we go to your room
[10734.25s -> 10736.25s]  That's gonna be the operating room
[10736.25s -> 10738.25s]  But I want to introduce you to one of my favorite doctors
[10738.25s -> 10740.25s]  Over here is Dr. Dean Dingleman
[10740.25s -> 10742.25s]  Dean Dingleman, here's the patient you'll be operating on
[10742.25s -> 10744.25s]  His name is
[10744.25s -> 10746.25s]  Kryden, Kayden, whatever his name is
[10746.25s -> 10748.25s]  Kayden
[10748.25s -> 10750.25s]  I just wanted to give you a close interaction with the doctor before you go and prep for surgery
[10750.25s -> 10752.25s]  Just take you up the floor too
[10752.25s -> 10754.25s]  That's all we gotta do here
[10754.25s -> 10756.25s]  Just don't mind me
[10756.25s -> 10758.25s]  Things always broken, gotta throw a can of dog food at it
[10758.25s -> 10760.25s]  To make sure we can get it open
[10760.25s -> 10762.25s]  But yeah, can you believe that weather?
[10762.25s -> 10764.25s]  I mean, we had like a foot of snow today
[10764.25s -> 10766.25s]  I mean, can't you believe?
[10766.25s -> 10769.38s]  Aw, ruined
[10769.38s -> 10772.33s]  You're not gonna let me push him out the elevator?
[10772.33s -> 10774.33s]  Let me push a guy out a fucking elevator
[10774.33s -> 10776.33s]  Fucking high-sea ectocoola
[10776.33s -> 10778.33s]  Let's see how you deal with this one
[10778.33s -> 10780.33s]  Alright sir, so go ahead and
[10780.33s -> 10782.33s]  They always slip, it doesn't matter if they're sitting
[10782.33s -> 10784.33s]  If they're on a fucking workout bench, it doesn't matter
[10784.33s -> 10786.33s]  It does not matter
[10786.33s -> 10794.58s]  I was gonna say
[10794.58s -> 10796.58s]  I remember having a very long
[10796.58s -> 10798.58s]  Discussion about something editing
[10798.58s -> 10800.58s]  On a naked man, I couldn't remember what it was
[10800.58s -> 10802.58s]  No, it's cause
[10802.58s -> 10804.58s]  I was trying to figure out how I wouldn't get
[10804.58s -> 10806.58s]  The video banned
[10806.58s -> 10808.58s]  I think that guy's dick is there
[10808.58s -> 10810.58s]  It's just full on
[10810.58s -> 10812.58s]  That guy's dick
[10812.58s -> 10814.58s]  His dick is there
[10814.58s -> 10816.58s]  That's so funny, the guy's walking around naked
[10816.58s -> 10818.58s]  So
[10818.58s -> 10820.89s]  We were trying to figure out
[10820.89s -> 10822.89s]  How do I make it so I can upload this part
[10822.89s -> 10824.89s]  And not like show a guy's dick
[10824.89s -> 10827.32s]  So
[10827.32s -> 10829.32s]  It was just like, oh
[10829.32s -> 10831.32s]  We'll just keyframe close on him
[10831.32s -> 10834.90s]  I really wanted to
[10834.90s -> 10836.90s]  Upload it just uncensored too
[10836.90s -> 10838.90s]  Cause that's so stupid, the guy's just walking around
[10838.90s -> 10841.27s]  Just naked
[10841.27s -> 10843.27s]  His like AI got
[10843.27s -> 10845.51s]  Screwed up or something
[10845.51s -> 10847.51s]  And he was just supposed to be clothed
[10847.51s -> 10849.51s]  But he was just walking around the office like this
[10849.51s -> 10852.84s]  Oh whoops, I forgot to tell Star to pause
[10852.84s -> 10854.84s]  Star, pause your video
[10856.84s -> 10858.84s]  Just keep going
[10858.84s -> 10860.84s]  You paused too much
[10860.84s -> 10862.84s]  Anyone ever tell you that?
[10862.84s -> 10864.84s]  You pause and then you talk for like a minute
[10864.84s -> 10866.84s]  And then you rewind a minute, then you rewatch the same thing
[10866.84s -> 10868.84s]  Get back to where you were and go, see what I said
[10868.84s -> 10870.84s]  And then you rewind like 10 more seconds
[10870.84s -> 10872.84s]  No I don't, I have like twice
[10872.84s -> 10874.84s]  Alright, get to 417
[10874.84s -> 10878.49s]  Look, you gotta give insight
[10878.49s -> 10881.05s]  You gotta like give insight to the video
[10881.05s -> 10883.05s]  It's director commentary
[10883.05s -> 10885.05s]  3, 2, 1, go
[10885.05s -> 10887.05s]  I didn't even tell you what time to go to, whatever
[10887.05s -> 10889.05s]  I didn't even tell you what time to go to, whatever
[10889.05s -> 10894.74s]  I didn't even tell you what time to go to, whatever
[10894.74s -> 10896.74s]  I didn't even tell you what time to go to, whatever
[10896.74s -> 10898.74s]  Everybody just saw that I came back from
[10898.74s -> 10901.11s]  I loaded into the game
[10901.11s -> 10903.11s]  I loaded into the game and this happened
[10903.11s -> 10905.11s]  I don't know what happened here
[10905.11s -> 10909.98s]  I had nothing to do with this, absolutely nothing to do with it
[10909.98s -> 10913.69s]  Naked guy come back?
[10913.69s -> 10918.55s]  Who's gonna get the sandwich first?
[10918.55s -> 10920.55s]  Everybody wanted the sandwich
[10920.55s -> 10922.55s]  What?
[10922.55s -> 10925.24s]  I didn't poison that sandwich
[10925.24s -> 10927.24s]  I didn't poison that sandwich
[10927.24s -> 10929.24s]  That guy just died
[10929.24s -> 10931.24s]  Because he ate a dirty sandwich
[10933.24s -> 10943.10s]  Wait just a second here
[10943.10s -> 10945.27s]  So you two, that's normal
[10945.27s -> 10947.27s]  You should be doing that
[10947.27s -> 10949.27s]  There's no reason why two people can't be sitting in the same spot
[10949.27s -> 10951.51s]  At the same time
[10951.51s -> 10957.53s]  I mean why
[10957.53s -> 10961.35s]  What are you doing?
[10961.35s -> 10963.35s]  Hey guys, welcome to my new hit series called
[10963.35s -> 10965.35s]  What would happen if this would happen?
[10965.35s -> 10967.35s]  So today in this new episode of
[10967.35s -> 10969.35s]  What would happen if this was gonna happen?
[10969.35s -> 10971.35s]  We have a thing of donuts here
[10971.35s -> 10973.35s]  And we've got these pills, we're gonna combine them
[10973.35s -> 10975.35s]  And we're gonna see, you know
[10975.35s -> 10977.35s]  What would happen if this was gonna happen?
[10977.35s -> 10979.35s]  See the doctor here, he doesn't even know there's donuts behind him
[10979.35s -> 10981.35s]  He's gonna pick up those donuts
[10981.35s -> 10983.35s]  Oh man, I mean like what's gonna happen here?
[10983.35s -> 10985.35s]  He's gonna eat these donuts, he loves donuts
[10985.35s -> 10987.35s]  With a giant pill box on them
[10989.35s -> 10991.35s]  So next episode on
[10991.35s -> 10993.35s]  What would happen if this was gonna happen?
[10993.35s -> 10997.64s]  Was that you?
[10997.64s -> 11000.52s]  I think so
[11000.52s -> 11002.76s]  Wait, I tried to like
[11002.76s -> 11005.64s]  Yeah at the very end
[11005.64s -> 11007.64s]  I had like three lines of dialogue in this video for no reason
[11007.64s -> 11009.64s]  That's because you're just in the call
[11009.64s -> 11011.64s]  Yeah
[11011.64s -> 11013.64s]  I tried to explain this before but sometimes
[11013.64s -> 11015.64s]  One of us would just be sitting in
[11015.64s -> 11017.64s]  See back in the day we didn't have
[11017.64s -> 11019.64s]  Discord, we had
[11019.64s -> 11021.64s]  Like a mumble or a team speak
[11021.64s -> 11023.64s]  Or like Skype
[11023.64s -> 11025.64s]  And you just would have to see if
[11025.64s -> 11027.64s]  Somebody was hanging out in like your team speak
[11027.64s -> 11029.64s]  Go in, oh I don't see any names
[11029.64s -> 11031.64s]  And then leave
[11031.64s -> 11033.64s]  Sometimes somebody would just be in there
[11033.64s -> 11035.64s]  With their microphone muted
[11035.64s -> 11037.64s]  And you'd come in and just be like, oh hey what are you doing?
[11037.64s -> 11039.64s]  Oh I'm just like recording a video
[11039.64s -> 11041.64s]  I'm just making a video and then the other person would just be sitting there
[11041.64s -> 11043.64s]  And I think that happened a few times
[11043.64s -> 11045.64s]  For videos you made too
[11045.64s -> 11047.64s]  Yeah?
[11047.64s -> 11049.64s]  Like I would just be there and I would just
[11049.64s -> 11051.64s]  Because we were in the same call
[11051.64s -> 11053.64s]  You would just react to something I would just say
[11053.64s -> 11055.64s]  You were just doing it, you just were because you were in the call
[11055.64s -> 11058.26s]  Like
[11058.26s -> 11060.26s]  What was it, my Go Go Nippon video
[11060.26s -> 11062.26s]  Where Mayla entered while I was recording it
[11062.26s -> 11064.26s]  And I didn't know he joined
[11064.26s -> 11066.26s]  Which is such a hard thing to explain to people
[11066.26s -> 11068.26s]  What happens in that scene
[11068.26s -> 11070.26s]  And like why it's so weird
[11070.26s -> 11072.57s]  But yeah we had a very open relationship with our voice chats
[11072.57s -> 11075.19s]  Yeah because that was how
[11075.19s -> 11077.19s]  You communicated because
[11077.19s -> 11079.19s]  Skype sucked
[11079.19s -> 11081.19s]  And nobody wanted to use it
[11081.19s -> 11083.19s]  The program was like a piece of crap
[11083.19s -> 11085.19s]  So the only way you could even
[11085.19s -> 11087.19s]  Communicate was you had to have
[11087.19s -> 11089.19s]  It was almost like AOL instant messenger
[11089.19s -> 11091.19s]  You just had like your, I'm away right now
[11091.19s -> 11093.19s]  But oh hey are you here?
[11093.19s -> 11095.19s]  That screen share was cool
[11095.19s -> 11097.19s]  I wish they would bring that to Discord
[11097.19s -> 11099.19s]  Are they bringing screen share to Discord?
[11099.19s -> 11101.19s]  It's there, they actually edited it a while back
[11101.19s -> 11103.19s]  Really?
[11103.19s -> 11105.19s]  Oh my god
[11105.19s -> 11107.88s]  I am late to the party
[11107.88s -> 11109.88s]  Have I updated my Discord in like two years?
[11109.88s -> 11111.88s]  Have I skipped every update?
[11111.88s -> 11113.88s]  I may have
[11113.88s -> 11116.31s]  You're gonna want to update that Discord
[11116.31s -> 11118.31s]  Alright I got time for
[11118.31s -> 11120.31s]  I got time for like two or three more
[11120.31s -> 11123.00s]  Because I have to go to the doctor so
[11123.00s -> 11126.14s]  People are saying zombie pianists
[11126.14s -> 11130.81s]  Zombie pianists
[11130.81s -> 11133.11s]  Is that
[11133.11s -> 11135.11s]  You gonna delete this video live or
[11135.11s -> 11137.11s]  Are you gonna keep it up?
[11137.11s -> 11139.11s]  I'm thinking of something else because I watched that when I did
[11139.11s -> 11141.11s]  My thing
[11141.11s -> 11143.11s]  Let's get one that you and I both haven't done
[11143.11s -> 11149.56s]  I
[11149.56s -> 11151.56s]  I like
[11151.56s -> 11153.56s]  You have a loadout video
[11153.56s -> 11155.93s]  I suspect it's probably
[11155.93s -> 11157.93s]  Loadout?
[11157.93s -> 11159.93s]  Yeah I'm just curious because
[11159.93s -> 11161.93s]  Remembering that loadout existed
[11161.93s -> 11163.93s]  Gives me a tickle sometimes
[11163.93s -> 11165.93s]  Do you want to know, okay
[11165.93s -> 11168.10s]  This is just
[11168.10s -> 11170.10s]  This is funny to me for some reason
[11170.10s -> 11172.10s]  Would you like to know my
[11172.10s -> 11174.79s]  YouTube search history?
[11174.79s -> 11176.79s]  I just clicked in the thing
[11176.79s -> 11180.12s]  Okay
[11180.12s -> 11182.12s]  The first
[11182.12s -> 11186.09s]  Let's just read, let's go down the list
[11186.09s -> 11188.09s]  Ludwig fight
[11188.09s -> 11191.48s]  McDonald's review
[11191.48s -> 11194.68s]  Review
[11194.68s -> 11198.95s]  Funny cats
[11198.95s -> 11200.95s]  And then Ned and
[11200.95s -> 11203.26s]  Varus
[11203.26s -> 11208.31s]  Like scene
[11208.31s -> 11210.31s]  Like I wanted to rewatch like a Game of Thrones
[11210.31s -> 11217.74s]  scene
[11217.74s -> 11219.74s]  What about you? What's your last like
[11219.74s -> 11221.74s]  YouTube search?
[11221.74s -> 11223.74s]  How do you even see what your previous ones are?
[11223.74s -> 11225.74s]  Just go to YouTube and then click in
[11225.74s -> 11229.51s]  Like the search bar
[11229.51s -> 11231.51s]  Nothing shows up. I don't think I've searched anything
[11231.51s -> 11233.51s]  And I reformat it somewhat recently
[11233.51s -> 11235.51s]  Ludwig fight
[11235.51s -> 11237.51s]  I like don't use YouTube at all anymore
[11237.51s -> 11239.51s]  Neither do I which is why I think some of these are old
[11239.51s -> 11244.57s]  Alright so which one
[11244.57s -> 11246.57s]  How convenient
[11246.57s -> 11248.57s]  No it's a bad idea and I know
[11248.57s -> 11250.57s]  It's a bad idea. Is it a shitty video?
[11250.57s -> 11252.57s]  I don't know
[11252.57s -> 11254.87s]  I don't remember it so it must be
[11254.87s -> 11256.87s]  I don't remember even having a video
[11256.87s -> 11258.87s]  Are you sure it wasn't one of yours?
[11258.87s -> 11260.87s]  No I'm scrolling through your videos
[11260.87s -> 11262.87s]  I saw it. We could watch
[11262.87s -> 11264.87s]  Starforge video
[11264.87s -> 11266.87s]  Oh yeah I remember that
[11266.87s -> 11269.43s]  Yeah that's right
[11269.43s -> 11271.43s]  With like the weird, yeah let's watch the stirforge one
[11271.43s -> 11274.57s]  That one sounds pretty good
[11274.57s -> 11279.82s]  Stirforge. Is this the first time you
[11279.82s -> 11283.14s]  Ever used this name? Is this how you
[11283.14s -> 11285.14s]  Changed to stir?
[11285.14s -> 11287.58s]  I think this was
[11287.58s -> 11290.01s]  Even before I ever
[11290.01s -> 11292.01s]  Used stir on anything
[11292.01s -> 11294.01s]  I think so yeah
[11294.01s -> 11296.50s]  This was 2015
[11296.50s -> 11298.50s]  I think I just thought stirforge sounded funny
[11298.50s -> 11301.45s]  Okay I have a
[11301.45s -> 11303.82s]  Rumor too. You do? You have rumors too?
[11303.82s -> 11305.82s]  Well I don't have rumors
[11305.82s -> 11308.18s]  I have almost like
[11308.18s -> 11310.18s]  50% chance when I'm streaming you will hear
[11310.18s -> 11312.18s]  The lawn being mowed or a thunderstorm
[11312.18s -> 11316.02s]  And then there's one guy who plays
[11316.02s -> 11318.02s]  His music really loud
[11318.02s -> 11320.02s]  Here it's just people just blasted
[11320.02s -> 11322.02s]  Down the street as loud as they can
[11322.02s -> 11324.39s]  In like a motorcycle or a car
[11324.39s -> 11326.39s]  When they get to my window they go
[11326.39s -> 11328.39s]  It's time to go to like fifth gear
[11328.39s -> 11330.89s]  I know he's up there
[11330.89s -> 11333.26s]  It's just like okay
[11333.26s -> 11335.26s]  It's always like that
[11335.26s -> 11337.26s]  Noise counseling walls
[11337.26s -> 11339.43s]  Noise counseling?
[11339.43s -> 11341.43s]  Forget it. Are you gonna watch this video?
[11341.43s -> 11343.86s]  Yeah. Alright you ready? Yep
[11343.86s -> 11345.86s]  One, two, three
[11345.86s -> 11352.65s]  Change it from like simple to like
[11352.65s -> 11354.65s]  Good and then take a look around
[11354.65s -> 11356.65s]  People thought that was me
[11356.65s -> 11358.65s]  That looks pretty good
[11358.65s -> 11360.65s]  Why does it look like I'm looking into the inside
[11360.65s -> 11363.91s]  Of my computer
[11363.91s -> 11365.91s]  I'm looking at microchips
[11365.91s -> 11367.91s]  Oh my god walk around it's like
[11367.91s -> 11370.28s]  Magnified grass
[11370.28s -> 11373.29s]  Walk
[11373.29s -> 11375.29s]  It really is
[11375.29s -> 11377.29s]  It's like a bunch of movie screens
[11377.29s -> 11379.29s]  Who's watching me?
[11379.29s -> 11381.29s]  It's you. You're watching
[11381.29s -> 11383.29s]  You have to walk into one of them. It takes you to like another dream dimension
[11383.29s -> 11385.29s]  Yeah I thought that too. Thought it was gonna be
[11385.29s -> 11387.29s]  Amazing. Turns out they're all just
[11387.29s -> 11389.29s]  Bushes
[11389.29s -> 11391.29s]  Oh what's this crazy
[11391.29s -> 11393.29s]  Oh it's a bush. What's that over here
[11393.29s -> 11395.29s]  Something tells me we're going to need to reload the game
[11395.29s -> 11397.29s]  I'm not doing it
[11397.29s -> 11399.29s]  You're gonna play the game like this
[11399.29s -> 11401.29s]  Yeah we're just gonna move on
[11401.29s -> 11403.29s]  Why?
[11403.29s -> 11405.29s]  Hey you wanna see? Hey dude check it out I got a hamster
[11405.29s -> 11407.29s]  My mom got me a hamster. Oh be gentle
[11407.29s -> 11409.29s]  Yeah
[11409.29s -> 11411.98s]  You can't why
[11411.98s -> 11413.98s]  Try and get your view and like see where the tunnels are
[11413.98s -> 11415.98s]  Yeah maybe like another like 100 feet this way
[11415.98s -> 11424.68s]  Oh
[11424.68s -> 11426.68s]  What is it starting to show me now is my gun in my hand
[11426.68s -> 11428.68s]  What the fuck it's a Hydralisk
[11428.68s -> 11430.68s]  Behind you
[11430.68s -> 11435.56s]  Let's not fight this
[11435.56s -> 11437.56s]  Kill it
[11437.56s -> 11439.56s]  Nothing in here
[11439.56s -> 11441.56s]  I can't look at this screen
[11441.56s -> 11443.56s]  This is awful
[11443.56s -> 11445.56s]  This is awful
[11445.56s -> 11447.56s]  Alright
[11447.56s -> 11449.56s]  I wanna jump off that cliff in front of you
[11449.56s -> 11451.56s]  Did this video get darker?
[11451.56s -> 11453.56s]  That mountain? Yeah I'm gonna jump off that mountain
[11453.56s -> 11455.56s]  This is a problem with YouTube
[11455.56s -> 11457.56s]  I don't think I knew about it back then
[11457.56s -> 11459.56s]  We're gonna get to the top of that and I'm going to jump off
[11459.56s -> 11461.56s]  Wait wait wait wait
[11461.56s -> 11463.56s]  Wait you won't listen to me
[11463.56s -> 11465.56s]  Wow
[11465.56s -> 11467.56s]  I'm not moving
[11467.56s -> 11469.56s]  I'm standing still
[11469.56s -> 11471.56s]  No one is here
[11471.56s -> 11480.71s]  What the fuck was that
[11480.71s -> 11486.34s]  It's fucking wild
[11486.34s -> 11488.97s]  You like my moon shoes?
[11488.97s -> 11490.97s]  Well use your moon shoes and
[11490.97s -> 11492.97s]  Fix the spinnies that aren't spinning
[11492.97s -> 11495.21s]  How do I do that? Do I just remove them?
[11495.21s -> 11497.21s]  Yeah you have to hold key
[11497.21s -> 11499.51s]  You have to get in there
[11499.51s -> 11501.51s]  What button is it? Just make sure there's a couple of glow sticks in here
[11501.51s -> 11505.29s]  Alright
[11505.29s -> 11507.59s]  What button do I press?
[11507.59s -> 11509.59s]  Where did you go?
[11509.59s -> 11511.59s]  Hello
[11511.59s -> 11513.59s]  This is Gary's video
[11513.59s -> 11515.59s]  You didn't tell me there were gonna be monsters
[11515.59s -> 11520.58s]  I didn't know
[11520.58s -> 11522.58s]  Don't you mean like an obstacle course?
[11522.58s -> 11524.58s]  Whoa
[11524.58s -> 11526.58s]  What's going on? What is that? Turn it off
[11526.58s -> 11528.58s]  What the fuck is that?
[11528.58s -> 11530.58s]  Is that a truck full of bees?
[11530.58s -> 11532.58s]  We got more bored with the actual game
[11532.58s -> 11534.58s]  The actual game is like
[11534.58s -> 11536.58s]  No no no
[11536.58s -> 11538.58s]  What are you doing?
[11538.58s -> 11540.58s]  Are you alive?
[11540.58s -> 11542.58s]  Yeah
[11542.58s -> 11544.58s]  Where are you?
[11544.58s -> 11546.58s]  They're following you now
[11546.58s -> 11548.58s]  I love how they're doing this
[11548.58s -> 11550.58s]  That's so awesome
[11550.58s -> 11552.58s]  You've got a pyramid and I've got a pyramid
[11552.58s -> 11554.58s]  We need to put them together
[11554.58s -> 11556.58s]  We need to make a bigger pyramid
[11567.24s -> 11569.24s]  They're on me
[11569.24s -> 11571.86s]  They're on me
[11573.86s -> 11575.86s]  He just like toppled it over
[11580.73s -> 11582.73s]  Well the video also is running at like
[11582.73s -> 11584.73s]  How are these guys not dead?
[11584.73s -> 11586.73s]  I don't know, it's absurd
[11586.73s -> 11590.23s]  Why would you build this?
[11590.23s -> 11592.23s]  What's the point?
[11592.23s -> 11595.37s]  There is always a point
[11595.37s -> 11597.37s]  Progress
[11597.37s -> 11600.44s]  Yeah
[11600.44s -> 11602.44s]  I'm not sure if the helipad is in the correct spot
[11602.44s -> 11604.44s]  That sucked
[11604.44s -> 11606.44s]  Did it just get launched out?
[11606.44s -> 11608.44s]  It just tapped one of them
[11608.44s -> 11610.44s]  It's out
[11610.44s -> 11612.44s]  Not even dramatically
[11612.44s -> 11614.81s]  We're doing this again
[11614.81s -> 11616.81s]  What the fuck?
[11616.81s -> 11618.81s]  Are there enough of them?
[11618.81s -> 11620.81s]  No, not enough of them
[11620.81s -> 11622.81s]  There's enough of them
[11622.81s -> 11624.81s]  That's enough
[11624.81s -> 11626.81s]  We're down to like 14 frames a second
[11641.48s -> 11643.48s]  That's not the stream, that's the video
[11643.48s -> 11648.60s]  Dude, I gotta get out of here
[11648.60s -> 11650.60s]  I'm about to exit the game
[11652.60s -> 11660.84s]  Through the wall
[11660.84s -> 11662.84s]  Am I wearing it?
[11662.84s -> 11664.84s]  On your screen?
[11664.84s -> 11666.84s]  It's like five mini guns
[11666.84s -> 11668.84s]  It's like
[11668.84s -> 11670.84s]  One, two, three, four, five, six
[11670.84s -> 11672.84s]  It's seven mini guns
[11672.84s -> 11674.84s]  There's just seven mini guns coming
[11674.84s -> 11676.84s]  I remember this
[11676.84s -> 11678.84s]  It just goes like
[11678.84s -> 11680.84s]  Can I shoot them?
[11682.84s -> 11685.98s]  I just ripped my headset off
[11688.28s -> 11690.28s]  I distinctly remember how fucking loud that was
[11690.28s -> 11692.28s]  This is the clip that
[11692.28s -> 11694.28s]  Taught me what contagious
[11694.28s -> 11696.28s]  laughter Reddit was
[11696.28s -> 11699.29s]  Does that kill you?
[11699.29s -> 11701.29s]  Oh yeah, absolutely
[11710.70s -> 11712.70s]  Alright, what if I shoot it down?
[11716.14s -> 11719.59s]  See you later
[11721.59s -> 11725.37s]  Hey Star
[11725.37s -> 11727.37s]  You ever seen the movie Jason?
[11738.06s -> 11740.87s]  Fuck, I'm at 10 frames a second
[11740.87s -> 11742.87s]  I can't tell what's happening, all I know is I'm just trying to keep myself alive
[11742.87s -> 11744.87s]  What is happening?
[11744.87s -> 11746.87s]  Why is this all down here?
[11746.87s -> 11748.87s]  You've done a terrible thing down here
[11748.87s -> 11751.37s]  You put too many down here
[11751.37s -> 11753.37s]  You put way too many
[11753.37s -> 11755.37s]  I need to get out of the pit
[11755.37s -> 11757.99s]  Help me
[11757.99s -> 11759.99s]  Where's the little safe hole?
[11759.99s -> 11761.99s]  Good luck finding it at 7 frames
[11761.99s -> 11763.99s]  I'm getting launched back up
[11763.99s -> 11765.99s]  Oh yeah, we made a safe hole in the side to get out of the carnage
[11765.99s -> 11767.99s]  The safe hole, the safe hole
[11767.99s -> 11769.99s]  I see it, I see the safe hole
[11769.99s -> 11771.99s]  You've gotta get in the safe hole, dude
[11771.99s -> 11773.99s]  Shut up, I know
[11773.99s -> 11775.99s]  You've gotta get in the safe hole
[11775.99s -> 11777.99s]  Blighttown, somebody said
[11780.23s -> 11782.23s]  This is too much
[11782.23s -> 11784.23s]  Blighttown
[11784.23s -> 11786.23s]  I think I got in the safe hole and you fucking chainsawed me
[11788.23s -> 11790.23s]  Alright, so, question
[11790.23s -> 11792.23s]  This is a very important question
[11792.23s -> 11799.34s]  You're gonna get what's coming to you
[11799.34s -> 11801.34s]  So, I have a question
[11801.34s -> 11803.34s]  Yeah?
[11803.34s -> 11807.30s]  Did that game ever release?
[11807.30s -> 11809.30s]  Good question, the answer is probably no
[11809.30s -> 11811.30s]  Was that game an early game?
[11811.30s -> 11813.80s]  That was an early game
[11816.04s -> 11818.04s]  Was there ever a 1.0 of that game?
[11818.04s -> 11820.04s]  It's been what?
[11820.04s -> 11822.04s]  It's been like 3 or 4 years
[11822.04s -> 11831.58s]  It has to be
[11831.58s -> 11833.58s]  The game was released
[11833.58s -> 11835.58s]  That's probably not the actual release
[11835.58s -> 11837.58s]  I'm gonna assume no
[11837.58s -> 11839.58s]  When did it was release?
[11839.58s -> 11842.58s]  It says September 18th, 2014
[11842.58s -> 11847.13s]  I feel like you made that video
[11847.13s -> 11849.13s]  When was that video?
[11849.13s -> 11851.13s]  2015
[11851.13s -> 11853.82s]  It flopped miserably and the devs continued to
[11853.82s -> 11855.82s]  Scan people with new games
[11855.82s -> 11857.82s]  Really?
[11857.82s -> 11862.15s]  I don't know
[11862.15s -> 11864.15s]  It was removed from Steam apparently
[11864.15s -> 11867.42s]  Alright, we can do 2 more
[11867.42s -> 11869.42s]  And then I've gotta go to the doctor
[11869.42s -> 11875.11s]  Let's see here
[11875.11s -> 11891.94s]  Everyone wants to watch
[11891.94s -> 11893.94s]  Jerma is mad
[11893.94s -> 11895.94s]  I'm seeing like 2 options
[11895.94s -> 11897.94s]  There's only 2 options
[11897.94s -> 11899.94s]  Yeah, but I feel like we've seen that already
[11899.94s -> 11901.94s]  Like a bunch of times
[11901.94s -> 11904.25s]  Didn't you watch it on your stream?
[11904.25s -> 11906.62s]  Definitely
[11906.62s -> 11908.62s]  Yeah, we've seen it
[11908.62s -> 11916.49s]  We've seen it already
[11916.49s -> 11918.49s]  I think we're just gonna have to make a new video
[11918.49s -> 11920.49s]  We've seen them all
[11920.49s -> 11922.49s]  Let's make a new Jerma is mad
[11922.49s -> 11924.49s]  You can just make another one
[11924.49s -> 11926.49s]  Yeah, like Diablo 4 when it comes out
[11926.49s -> 11928.49s]  Just follow me around and I'll be like
[11928.49s -> 11930.49s]  Fuck, fucking idiot, fuck you
[11930.49s -> 11932.49s]  Fuck, dude
[11932.49s -> 11934.49s]  Fuck, dude
[11934.49s -> 11937.74s]  Hello?
[11937.74s -> 11942.60s]  What the fuck was that?
[11942.60s -> 11945.16s]  I'm a soundboard boy now
[11945.16s -> 11947.16s]  Oh, okay
[11947.16s -> 11949.16s]  That wasn't me that just said that
[11949.16s -> 11951.77s]  No, it wasn't you
[11951.77s -> 11953.77s]  Why do you have a like, fuck, dude?
[11953.77s -> 11955.77s]  They're doing the he doesn't know
[11955.77s -> 11957.77s]  I record people's
[11957.77s -> 11959.77s]  Outrage in Overwatch now
[11959.77s -> 11961.77s]  It's my past time
[11961.77s -> 11965.16s]  Oh, I know
[11965.16s -> 11967.16s]  I thought you had that
[11967.16s -> 11969.16s]  I thought that was me because I just said, fuck, dude
[11969.16s -> 11971.16s]  Yeah, and it reminded me that I have
[11971.16s -> 11973.16s]  Two separate people saying it
[11973.16s -> 11975.85s]  What else do you have on there right now?
[11975.85s -> 11977.85s]  Fucking ungrateful DPS fucking cuck
[11977.85s -> 11980.60s]  People get mad
[11980.60s -> 11983.74s]  Is this Jerma uncensored right now?
[11983.74s -> 11987.64s]  No, no, no, no, no
[11987.64s -> 11989.64s]  This is not
[11989.64s -> 11992.58s]  Nope
[11992.58s -> 11994.58s]  I'll give you the longest
[11994.58s -> 11996.58s]  Jerma uncensored right now
[11996.58s -> 11998.58s]  But you have to wait until the end because the last guy who talks is the best guy
[11998.58s -> 12000.82s]  You're ramming DPS against the fucking wall
[12000.82s -> 12002.82s]  And praying to God that it fucking works
[12002.82s -> 12004.82s]  But you're fucking
[12004.82s -> 12006.82s]  Shit at the game
[12006.82s -> 12009.06s]  Dude, you're fucking a mercy player
[12009.06s -> 12013.93s]  Show us
[12013.93s -> 12018.20s]  Why do you
[12018.20s -> 12020.20s]  I was looking for the mute, I was
[12020.20s -> 12023.72s]  You asked
[12023.72s -> 12026.73s]  I said mad people in Overwatch
[12026.73s -> 12028.73s]  Why do you do that?
[12028.73s -> 12030.97s]  Because
[12030.97s -> 12033.34s]  Okay, for one, it's really funny when you play it back
[12033.34s -> 12035.34s]  To the person who said it and they get to hear themselves
[12035.34s -> 12037.34s]  Right
[12037.34s -> 12040.34s]  That's kind of a defining moment of life
[12040.34s -> 12042.34s]  And the second reason
[12042.34s -> 12044.34s]  Wrap one of me
[12044.34s -> 12047.67s]  And save this for whenever you need it
[12047.67s -> 12049.67s]  Can we get somebody on the fucking
[12049.67s -> 12051.67s]  On the cart please?
[12051.67s -> 12053.67s]  Because there's been like 10 fucking minutes straight of this bullshit
[12053.67s -> 12056.36s]  Somebody else change to DPS too
[12056.36s -> 12058.36s]  Can we get somebody on the fucking
[12058.36s -> 12060.36s]  On the cart please? Because there's been like 10 fucking minutes straight of this bullshit
[12060.36s -> 12063.43s]  There you go
[12063.43s -> 12065.61s]  Just so you can play that somewhere
[12065.61s -> 12069.13s]  I can't wait for this play of the game dude
[12069.13s -> 12072.46s]  That's my one wholesome one
[12072.46s -> 12074.63s]  You need a wholesome one
[12074.63s -> 12076.63s]  Listen to the sounds of despair
[12076.63s -> 12079.83s]  Like I don't understand
[12079.83s -> 12084.74s]  Please
[12084.74s -> 12086.74s]  He's given up, his life is over
[12086.74s -> 12088.74s]  Alright, let's watch another video
[12088.74s -> 12090.74s]  I don't want to listen to like the spy cam
[12090.74s -> 12093.30s]  Like recording people
[12093.30s -> 12095.86s]  We want to talk about YouTubers
[12095.86s -> 12097.86s]  Alright, let's go
[12097.86s -> 12101.43s]  When are we going to watch Jerma play the goat game?
[12101.43s -> 12105.98s]  Oh no, no, you said it
[12105.98s -> 12109.82s]  Why did you have to say that?
[12109.82s -> 12111.99s]  You're going to talk shit about me
[12111.99s -> 12116.34s]  You're going to watch the Diablo incident
[12116.34s -> 12118.34s]  Oh fuck, I do have a video on this game
[12118.34s -> 12122.50s]  The goat simulator game
[12122.50s -> 12126.26s]  Shit, okay
[12126.26s -> 12128.26s]  Alright, this is like you just
[12128.26s -> 12130.26s]  The lawyers finally proved you're guilty
[12130.26s -> 12132.26s]  And you can't even deny it anymore
[12132.26s -> 12134.26s]  The verdict just comes through
[12134.26s -> 12136.26s]  The evidence comes through, it's like they'll never get me
[12136.26s -> 12138.26s]  They'll never fucking catch me
[12138.26s -> 12140.26s]  And all of a sudden like a bloody knife comes in that you recognize
[12140.26s -> 12142.26s]  And you're like that's my knife and that's my hand
[12142.26s -> 12144.26s]  My hand prints on it
[12144.26s -> 12146.63s]  It's over, I lose
[12146.63s -> 12148.63s]  There it is
[12148.63s -> 12150.63s]  I didn't think they'd get it
[12150.63s -> 12152.81s]  But it was there on your channel all these years
[12152.81s -> 12155.93s]  Damn it
[12155.93s -> 12157.93s]  Remember to plus like to help spread the infection
[12157.93s -> 12159.93s]  You did that too
[12159.93s -> 12161.93s]  You can't throw that on me
[12161.93s -> 12163.93s]  No I didn't
[12163.93s -> 12165.93s]  And if you liked the video
[12165.93s -> 12167.93s]  I used to watch your YouTube videos
[12167.93s -> 12169.93s]  Back before I even started making YouTube videos
[12169.93s -> 12171.93s]  And you would say
[12171.93s -> 12173.93s]  Hey guys, like the video if you enjoyed watching
[12173.93s -> 12175.93s]  Like it likes help
[12175.93s -> 12177.93s]  That's fine, I'm talking about
[12177.93s -> 12179.93s]  Plus like to join my cult
[12179.93s -> 12190.55s]  Alright, I'm stalling too much
[12190.55s -> 12199.77s]  I mean, you could bail
[12199.77s -> 12202.95s]  I could bail, it's too late to bail though
[12202.95s -> 12205.83s]  Oh, the internet, Cox internet
[12205.83s -> 12210.76s]  I'm clicking it
[12210.76s -> 12212.76s]  Are you watching this too at the same time?
[12212.76s -> 12215.13s]  Is this really one of the ones we're going to go out on?
[12215.13s -> 12217.37s]  One more after this? Do you really have to go?
[12217.37s -> 12219.93s]  I can do one more
[12219.93s -> 12221.93s]  Okay, because you can't end on goat games
[12221.93s -> 12223.93s]  You have to end on a high note
[12223.93s -> 12225.93s]  This isn't really who you are, it doesn't define you
[12225.93s -> 12227.93s]  Plus, we can do this shit again too
[12227.93s -> 12232.02s]  Like we can do this like next week or something
[12232.02s -> 12234.02s]  Is Cox actually being a problem?
[12234.02s -> 12236.02s]  Oh fuck, fuck
[12236.02s -> 12238.02s]  I mean it is apparently
[12238.02s -> 12244.81s]  Ready, three, two, one, go
[12258.87s -> 12261.69s]  I think it's funny
[12261.69s -> 12263.99s]  It's already funny
[12263.99s -> 12265.99s]  I'll give this one to you, it's pretty good
[12269.99s -> 12277.80s]  Fuck, I think this is funny
[12280.17s -> 12282.17s]  My legs are so weak
[12282.17s -> 12284.17s]  I really need to
[12284.17s -> 12286.17s]  Strengthen them on the treadmill
[12288.17s -> 12294.31s]  The tower of the goat
[12294.31s -> 12296.31s]  Was once
[12296.31s -> 12298.31s]  Key to the treasure of the gold
[12298.31s -> 12300.31s]  Buried underneath
[12300.31s -> 12302.31s]  Mortamus, the grey goat
[12302.31s -> 12304.31s]  Helmed the tea to the tower
[12304.31s -> 12306.31s]  For generations
[12306.31s -> 12308.31s]  And
[12308.31s -> 12310.31s]  Excalibur, the black and white goat
[12310.31s -> 12315.56s]  White goat
[12315.56s -> 12317.56s]  Nice setup
[12317.56s -> 12320.38s]  Somebody on the computer over there, they eating dinner?
[12320.38s -> 12322.87s]  Hi, I'm Mr. Goat
[12322.87s -> 12326.97s]  I hope you are enjoying your dinner
[12326.97s -> 12331.90s]  This game is amazing
[12331.90s -> 12335.61s]  Trampoline baby
[12335.61s -> 12337.61s]  I used to have one of these in my backyard
[12337.61s -> 12339.61s]  Want to see what I used to do in the trampoline guys?
[12339.61s -> 12341.61s]  If you gave me trampoline right now
[12341.61s -> 12343.61s]  I can do three black flips on it
[12343.61s -> 12345.61s]  Hold on, this does not seem to be right
[12345.61s -> 12347.61s]  Did I go trampolining with you?
[12347.61s -> 12349.61s]  Yeah, pause the video
[12349.61s -> 12351.61s]  Pause the video
[12353.61s -> 12356.68s]  Pause the video
[12356.68s -> 12358.68s]  We went to a trampoline fun park
[12358.68s -> 12360.68s]  And how sick was I at trampolining?
[12363.94s -> 12366.76s]  You were probably
[12366.76s -> 12368.76s]  Besides the people we came with
[12368.76s -> 12371.51s]  The only adult there
[12371.51s -> 12374.52s]  And you were very good
[12374.52s -> 12382.07s]  You were better than all those other six year olds
[12382.07s -> 12385.02s]  Take that to the grave
[12385.02s -> 12387.02s]  I think we were probably the only people
[12387.02s -> 12389.02s]  Over the age of like
[12389.02s -> 12391.02s]  We may be the only people that were over 30
[12391.02s -> 12393.02s]  That didn't have children
[12393.02s -> 12395.19s]  There
[12395.19s -> 12397.19s]  I was like, dunking on people
[12397.19s -> 12402.30s]  I wasn't over 30
[12402.30s -> 12405.11s]  I don't know
[12405.11s -> 12407.67s]  How long ago was that?
[12407.67s -> 12409.67s]  Dude, I was like jumping so high from like
[12409.67s -> 12411.67s]  Thing to thing and I was doing like
[12411.67s -> 12414.55s]  Backflips off the wall
[12414.55s -> 12416.55s]  I was like, I was flexing on everybody there
[12416.55s -> 12420.20s]  We did the thing where
[12420.20s -> 12422.20s]  I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait
[12422.20s -> 12424.20s]  There was like a ton of people making a circle around me
[12424.20s -> 12426.20s]  And I was like, dancing and fucking doing flips and shit
[12426.20s -> 12428.20s]  People were like, clapping along
[12428.20s -> 12431.14s]  If only we had a video of the
[12431.14s -> 12433.14s]  Trampoline park when people would know
[12433.14s -> 12435.77s]  It was pretty fun, but I was
[12435.77s -> 12437.77s]  Confirmed that I could do a backflip off the wall
[12437.77s -> 12439.77s]  I just want you to
[12439.77s -> 12441.77s]  Thank you
[12441.77s -> 12443.77s]  Well, the walls were trampolines
[12443.77s -> 12445.77s]  I jumped into the wall, jumped off the wall, backflip off the wall
[12445.77s -> 12447.77s]  Land, another backflip
[12447.77s -> 12449.77s]  Then into a twist
[12449.77s -> 12451.77s]  The skater
[12451.77s -> 12453.77s]  9, 10 out of 10
[12453.77s -> 12455.77s]  Yeah, I held up a 9
[12455.77s -> 12457.77s]  I thought it could have been a little better
[12457.77s -> 12459.77s]  Yeah, but I mean I'm pretty fucking sick
[12459.77s -> 12461.77s]  At that
[12461.77s -> 12463.94s]  Alright, ready? 3, 2, 1
[12463.94s -> 12465.94s]  Push, catch me
[12465.94s -> 12467.94s]  Catch me please, help
[12467.94s -> 12470.70s]  Not gonna invite me
[12470.70s -> 12472.70s]  To your backyard
[12472.70s -> 12474.70s]  Party
[12474.70s -> 12476.70s]  I'll show you
[12476.70s -> 12478.70s]  I wanted the hot dogs
[12478.70s -> 12481.00s]  What?
[12481.00s -> 12483.24s]  I was trying to kick the thing
[12483.24s -> 12485.24s]  The thing over there and it didn't even work
[12485.24s -> 12487.24s]  You know what? It is gonna work
[12487.24s -> 12489.24s]  I'll make it work
[12489.24s -> 12492.30s]  I hope
[12492.30s -> 12494.30s]  He's flying
[12494.30s -> 12496.47s]  And he's on fire
[12496.47s -> 12499.48s]  Oh, and these people
[12499.48s -> 12501.66s]  Are all still dancing
[12501.66s -> 12503.66s]  Do you see what just happened to the guy that was hosting
[12503.66s -> 12505.96s]  The event?
[12505.96s -> 12507.96s]  What kind of dance is this?
[12507.96s -> 12510.26s]  Do this dance? No
[12510.26s -> 12512.26s]  I've never seen anybody do this
[12512.26s -> 12514.26s]  Dance, unless you were a toddler
[12514.26s -> 12516.26s]  These people are doing the
[12516.26s -> 12518.26s]  I'm a toddler learning how to dance
[12518.26s -> 12520.26s]  To like Mickey Mouse music
[12520.26s -> 12522.26s]  Any sensitive streamer makes fun of white people dances
[12522.26s -> 12524.26s]  Like this?
[12524.26s -> 12526.26s]  Honey, can you just go check on the greenhouse
[12526.26s -> 12528.26s]  And make sure my petunias
[12528.26s -> 12530.26s]  Are in line? Oh sure thing honey
[12530.26s -> 12532.26s]  Oh, the glass doesn't break
[12532.26s -> 12534.26s]  I've got your
[12534.26s -> 12536.26s]  Favorite breakfast cereal waiting for you
[12536.26s -> 12538.57s]  It's
[12538.57s -> 12540.57s]  Pop tarts
[12540.57s -> 12542.57s]  Oh, pop tarts
[12542.57s -> 12544.57s]  There's that in
[12544.57s -> 12546.57s]  I hate going grocery shopping
[12546.57s -> 12548.57s]  I always have to go grocery shopping
[12548.57s -> 12550.57s]  It sucks
[12550.57s -> 12552.57s]  I'm gonna get Coca-Cola Classic, that's like my favorite
[12552.57s -> 12554.57s]  And I'm gonna get Doritos, Spanada chips
[12554.57s -> 12556.57s]  Those are good too
[12556.57s -> 12558.57s]  I also want, what else do I want?
[12558.57s -> 12560.57s]  I guess I could use
[12560.57s -> 12562.57s]  A little bit of ham, do they have ham here?
[12562.57s -> 12564.57s]  I don't even know, maybe
[12564.57s -> 12566.57s]  Excuse me, sir, do you have ham?
[12566.57s -> 12568.57s]  Oh, he's not here anymore
[12568.57s -> 12571.51s]  Oh, she's dead
[12571.51s -> 12573.51s]  You must take
[12573.51s -> 12575.51s]  The garbage out of the cave
[12575.51s -> 12577.51s]  Of mystery
[12577.51s -> 12579.51s]  And you shall not pass
[12579.51s -> 12582.20s]  And do it fast enough
[12582.20s -> 12584.20s]  You can go first
[12584.20s -> 12586.20s]  Because best friends let their best friends
[12586.20s -> 12588.20s]  Go first on the slide
[12588.20s -> 12590.57s]  Okay
[12590.57s -> 12592.57s]  Have fun
[12592.57s -> 12594.81s]  Have fun on the slide
[12594.81s -> 12598.52s]  Wee
[12598.52s -> 12600.52s]  This is so much
[12600.52s -> 12602.52s]  Fun
[12602.52s -> 12604.52s]  I'm laughing at it
[12604.52s -> 12606.52s]  I am, that's humorous
[12606.52s -> 12609.91s]  Whoa, whoa, sorry
[12609.91s -> 12611.91s]  I'm sorry, I'll pay for that
[12611.91s -> 12613.91s]  I'll make sure you get like an extra monitor
[12613.91s -> 12615.91s]  A 27-incher
[12615.91s -> 12617.91s]  Not just a 22-incher, whatever that is
[12617.91s -> 12619.91s]  Who are you, Bill? How's life?
[12619.91s -> 12621.91s]  How's the kids?
[12621.91s -> 12623.91s]  Yeah, the kids are good, huh?
[12623.91s -> 12625.91s]  Yeah, that's great
[12625.91s -> 12627.91s]  Everybody expects me
[12627.91s -> 12629.91s]  To just trash this place
[12629.91s -> 12632.26s]  But you know what?
[12632.26s -> 12634.26s]  I think I'm gonna have some self-control
[12634.26s -> 12636.26s]  Because I could just
[12636.26s -> 12638.26s]  Trash this place right now
[12638.26s -> 12640.95s]  And it's really
[12640.95s -> 12642.95s]  Starting to build up that I really
[12642.95s -> 12645.32s]  Want to do it
[12645.32s -> 12647.32s]  But I think I'm gonna hold back
[12647.32s -> 12649.32s]  Just a little bit right now
[12649.32s -> 12651.32s]  Get out before I
[12651.32s -> 12653.32s]  Change my mind
[12653.32s -> 12655.32s]  Pretty humorous
[12657.82s -> 12663.26s]  Fuck you
[12663.26s -> 12665.26s]  Hello, sir
[12665.26s -> 12667.69s]  This mower
[12667.69s -> 12669.69s]  I feel like this video is like two hours long
[12669.69s -> 12671.69s]  Yeah, I was gonna say this is one of those videos
[12671.69s -> 12673.69s]  Where it's only
[12673.69s -> 12676.12s]  Six minutes and it just feels like it
[12676.12s -> 12678.12s]  Extends time
[12678.12s -> 12682.28s]  Oh, pause, by the way
[12682.28s -> 12685.67s]  Okay
[12685.67s -> 12690.02s]  506
[12690.02s -> 12692.02s]  You're just making it take longer by pausing, you know
[12692.02s -> 12694.02s]  Yeah, I know
[12694.02s -> 12696.02s]  Goat station
[12696.02s -> 12698.02s]  Did I tell you that today
[12698.02s -> 12700.02s]  Was baseball day at the gas station?
[12700.02s -> 12704.06s]  Oh, do you know
[12704.06s -> 12706.06s]  The stream that I'm doing?
[12706.06s -> 12708.06s]  We haven't talked in like fucking two months
[12708.06s -> 12710.06s]  Hey Mortimer, welcome to the party
[12710.06s -> 12712.06s]  Hey Frank
[12712.06s -> 12714.06s]  How are ya?
[12714.06s -> 12716.06s]  What are you cooking on the grill?
[12716.06s -> 12718.06s]  We've got some
[12718.06s -> 12720.06s]  Various meats that we are
[12720.06s -> 12722.06s]  Cooking here on the grill
[12722.06s -> 12724.06s]  That better not be
[12724.06s -> 12726.06s]  Goat meat
[12726.06s -> 12728.06s]  If it's goat meat I'll be upset
[12728.06s -> 12730.06s]  With you
[12730.06s -> 12732.06s]  It is lamb
[12732.06s -> 12734.06s]  My family we eat lamb
[12734.06s -> 12736.06s]  Time difference
[12736.06s -> 12738.23s]  Come here
[12738.23s -> 12740.23s]  It's not like two hours have gone by
[12740.23s -> 12742.23s]  Holy
[12742.23s -> 12744.23s]  This is like Katamari Damasi
[12744.23s -> 12747.43s]  Pretty good burger
[12747.43s -> 12755.43s]  How much stuff can I pick up?
[12755.43s -> 12757.43s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa
[12757.43s -> 12761.32s]  That's humorous
[12761.32s -> 12767.59s]  This is
[12767.59s -> 12769.59s]  Alright, this is the equivalent
[12769.59s -> 12772.73s]  Of going back and looking at your yearbook
[12772.73s -> 12774.73s]  Go back to your junior high yearbook
[12774.73s -> 12776.73s]  And be like, what did I do back then?
[12776.73s -> 12778.73s]  It's because back then
[12778.73s -> 12780.73s]  We didn't have the common sense
[12780.73s -> 12782.73s]  To say there's two minutes of good clips
[12782.73s -> 12784.73s]  I have, why don't I just
[12784.73s -> 12786.73s]  Combine it with another game
[12786.73s -> 12788.73s]  It always had to be all one game
[12788.73s -> 12790.73s]  You try and make
[12790.73s -> 12792.73s]  And then it has to be like at least five minutes
[12792.73s -> 12794.73s]  To make it feel like it's worth anyone's time
[12794.73s -> 12796.73s]  Who's gonna upload a two minute video?
[12796.73s -> 12798.73s]  It was always like, oh this is like three and a half minutes
[12798.73s -> 12800.73s]  Fuck, is that
[12800.73s -> 12802.73s]  Long enough?
[12802.73s -> 12804.73s]  I haven't had a video up in like
[12804.73s -> 12808.12s]  Four or five days
[12808.12s -> 12816.44s]  But yeah
[12816.44s -> 12818.44s]  I heard you mention a weird stream
[12818.44s -> 12820.44s]  At the beginning of the stream
[12820.44s -> 12822.44s]  So I don't know if it is
[12822.44s -> 12824.74s]  Oh, um
[12824.74s -> 12827.24s]  I
[12827.24s -> 12829.24s]  I'm doing a Twitch controlled
[12829.24s -> 12832.38s]  Robot carnival
[12832.38s -> 12834.38s]  Where I'm gonna have like a bunch of carnival games that Twitch
[12834.38s -> 12836.38s]  Chat controls and tries to win
[12836.38s -> 12843.42s]  And clowns and shit
[12843.42s -> 12845.72s]  This is reminding me that
[12845.72s -> 12847.72s]  At E3 Twitch had a stream
[12847.72s -> 12849.72s]  Where you controlled the person walking around E3
[12849.72s -> 12852.66s]  And what they did
[12852.66s -> 12854.90s]  And it did not go well
[12854.90s -> 12856.90s]  This is gonna go very well
[12856.90s -> 12861.26s]  Okay
[12861.26s -> 12863.26s]  Cause I'm worried about you
[12863.26s -> 12865.26s]  Hey I'm gonna mute for a second cause this is like spoiler
[12865.26s -> 12867.26s]  So they're not gonna be able to hear me
[12867.26s -> 12880.28s]  Okay
[12880.28s -> 12883.86s]  What?
[12883.86s -> 12886.30s]  Not muted?
[12886.30s -> 12888.30s]  No no you're muted now
[12888.30s -> 12890.30s]  I muted myself
[12890.30s -> 12892.30s]  To say that to you
[12892.30s -> 12894.30s]  Okay well chat was saying not muted
[12894.30s -> 12896.30s]  I don't think they are
[12896.30s -> 12898.30s]  You're not muted
[12898.30s -> 12900.30s]  I was going to repeat word for word what you said
[12900.30s -> 12902.30s]  But then you hit me with a fucking bomb
[12902.30s -> 12904.30s]  And I cannot
[12904.30s -> 12906.30s]  In good conscience repeat that
[12906.30s -> 12908.60s]  What do you mean in good conscience?
[12908.60s -> 12910.60s]  I just
[12910.60s -> 12913.86s]  I feel like
[12913.86s -> 12915.86s]  If I was just a germa viewer
[12915.86s -> 12917.86s]  And I didn't know you
[12917.86s -> 12919.86s]  I'd feel really bad for you
[12923.82s -> 12925.82s]  It puts people in a very uncomfortable situation
[12925.82s -> 12927.82s]  Wait what?
[12927.82s -> 12930.82s]  Why?
[12930.82s -> 12932.82s]  Mute! Mute! No no no
[12932.82s -> 12946.84s]  Hold on
[12946.84s -> 12948.84s]  We can just talk after the stream
[12948.84s -> 12951.02s]  Yeah like I'm not bound
[12951.02s -> 12953.02s]  To your stream
[12953.02s -> 12956.60s]  What am I doing?
[12956.60s -> 12958.60s]  I feel like I'm scared
[12958.60s -> 12960.60s]  This stream is gonna edit
[12960.60s -> 12962.60s]  We're never gonna talk for two months
[12962.60s -> 12964.60s]  I couldn't just say hi to him
[12964.60s -> 12966.60s]  One more one more one more
[12966.60s -> 12968.90s]  One more
[12968.90s -> 12974.60s]  What really happened?
[12974.60s -> 12977.93s]  Garbage
[12977.93s -> 12979.93s]  We need to end on a very good one
[12979.93s -> 12981.93s]  No that video
[12981.93s -> 12983.93s]  What's wrong with that video?
[12983.93s -> 12985.93s]  It is a good video
[12985.93s -> 12988.94s]  I wouldn't say garbage
[12988.94s -> 12990.94s]  People have been asking for GTA 4
[12990.94s -> 12992.94s]  All stream though
[12992.94s -> 12995.56s]  What's your favorite GTA 4 video?
[12995.56s -> 12998.50s]  I
[12998.50s -> 13000.50s]  I like playing zebras dance and shit
[13000.50s -> 13002.50s]  It's like the club
[13002.50s -> 13007.05s]  Club tornado
[13007.05s -> 13015.16s]  That's a pretty good one
[13015.16s -> 13017.16s]  Hold on is this
[13017.16s -> 13019.16s]  Wait a minute wait a minute
[13019.16s -> 13021.34s]  I remember this and we never used it
[13021.34s -> 13023.34s]  We never used this
[13023.34s -> 13025.64s]  Remember I did this every GTA video
[13025.64s -> 13027.64s]  Hold on we're gonna pause it after we watch for a minute
[13027.64s -> 13029.64s]  We're gonna pause after a minute
[13029.64s -> 13032.01s]  Okay so we're doing club tornado
[13032.01s -> 13034.01s]  And
[13034.01s -> 13036.57s]  There was a very specific thing
[13036.57s -> 13038.74s]  That I used to do every time
[13038.74s -> 13040.74s]  The loading screen would pop up
[13040.74s -> 13042.74s]  And it would be that
[13042.74s -> 13044.74s]  Let's see let's listen
[13044.74s -> 13047.30s]  Are you ready?
[13047.30s -> 13049.30s]  Three two one go
[13049.30s -> 13051.30s]  Shout out to all those back home
[13051.30s -> 13053.30s]  Hey mom there's a new night
[13053.30s -> 13055.30s]  That's not what it was
[13055.30s -> 13058.06s]  Didn't I used to say like
[13058.06s -> 13060.06s]  I used to go like
[13060.06s -> 13062.06s]  Like star up like
[13062.06s -> 13064.49s]  What was it was something about like
[13064.49s -> 13066.49s]  Was something about like weirdly enough
[13066.49s -> 13068.49s]  I think you did used to do a star you suck
[13068.49s -> 13070.66s]  It was star you suck
[13070.66s -> 13072.66s]  And then it was something about like
[13072.66s -> 13074.66s]  I don't even remember
[13074.66s -> 13077.48s]  I have no idea
[13077.48s -> 13080.42s]  Wait what say that again
[13080.42s -> 13082.42s]  I think it was star you suck
[13082.42s -> 13084.42s]  It was something about me getting a broom up your ass
[13084.42s -> 13086.42s]  It was something about me getting a broom
[13086.42s -> 13088.42s]  No no I think you doing it to me
[13088.42s -> 13092.58s]  What no
[13092.58s -> 13094.58s]  Okay mute us both
[13094.58s -> 13096.58s]  No no
[13096.58s -> 13098.82s]  Are you ready
[13098.82s -> 13101.45s]  What the fuck are you talking about
[13101.45s -> 13103.45s]  Three two one play
[13103.45s -> 13105.45s]  Club tornado
[13105.45s -> 13108.39s]  We've done the establishing
[13108.39s -> 13110.39s]  Transition shot so now
[13110.39s -> 13112.39s]  That's how you can tell that I traveled
[13112.39s -> 13114.39s]  To get here there's people throwing up outside
[13114.39s -> 13116.39s]  Probably because club tornado is
[13116.39s -> 13118.39s]  That amazing of a place
[13118.39s -> 13120.39s]  Fun is measured in vomit
[13120.39s -> 13122.39s]  You get off a roller coaster you fun
[13122.39s -> 13124.39s]  It was fun
[13124.39s -> 13126.39s]  Get the fuck out of my way
[13126.39s -> 13128.39s]  I fucking love this game
[13128.39s -> 13130.39s]  I don't get it it's just like any other club
[13139.30s -> 13142.25s]  Now we're leaving
[13142.25s -> 13144.25s]  We don't like this club
[13144.25s -> 13146.25s]  Club tornado you guys been there
[13146.25s -> 13148.25s]  Don't fucking come to club tornado
[13148.25s -> 13150.25s]  It's not even cool
[13150.25s -> 13152.25s]  It's kinda cool I like it
[13152.25s -> 13154.25s]  He's sitting down
[13154.25s -> 13157.38s]  No he's not
[13162.20s -> 13164.20s]  Watch out watch out
[13164.20s -> 13168.04s]  Watch out
[13168.04s -> 13172.14s]  Ten people just get fucking thrown around
[13172.14s -> 13176.34s]  By a tornado
[13176.34s -> 13178.34s]  This is a good beat man
[13178.34s -> 13183.40s]  That guy is on fire
[13183.40s -> 13185.40s]  Being an impressive motherfucker right now
[13185.40s -> 13187.40s]  It's gonna go out don't worry about it
[13187.40s -> 13189.40s]  Yeah I'm good
[13189.40s -> 13191.40s]  I remember we tried to figure out
[13191.40s -> 13193.40s]  My dancing mechanics for like 30 minutes
[13193.40s -> 13196.15s]  Go in the bathroom and make out or something
[13200.15s -> 13202.15s]  Fucking done
[13202.15s -> 13204.15s]  Another episode like that not gonna shit my pants
[13204.15s -> 13207.86s]  That was a problem quite frequently apparently
[13226.17s -> 13228.17s]  Damn it
[13228.17s -> 13230.47s]  Oh that filled up
[13230.47s -> 13232.47s]  That was a good one
[13232.47s -> 13239.24s]  That was a good one
[13239.24s -> 13241.24s]  Damn it
[13261.78s -> 13263.78s]  What the fuck happened
[13263.78s -> 13265.78s]  Ever since I made that video
[13265.78s -> 13267.78s]  About club tornado this place just sucks now
[13267.78s -> 13269.78s]  It's not even worth coming back here
[13269.78s -> 13271.78s]  This is pathetic
[13271.78s -> 13273.78s]  I'm leaving the worst review I can leave
[13280.02s -> 13282.02s]  What have I done
[13282.02s -> 13284.02s]  Why would you do this
[13284.02s -> 13286.02s]  I don't want to dance with this dusty old hurt
[13286.02s -> 13296.14s]  Well if that club is ruined
[13296.14s -> 13298.14s]  Let's try this knock off
[13298.14s -> 13300.14s]  Like imitation club tornado
[13302.14s -> 13305.59s]  Already
[13305.59s -> 13307.59s]  Oh my god
[13307.59s -> 13309.59s]  Everyone just look at these guys
[13309.59s -> 13311.59s]  Just standing around looking at you
[13311.59s -> 13313.59s]  Get me out of this dude corner
[13313.59s -> 13315.59s]  This isn't even a tornado
[13315.59s -> 13317.59s]  This is just a bunch of guys just like stuck up
[13317.59s -> 13319.59s]  In the ceiling
[13319.59s -> 13321.59s]  This is club vacuum
[13321.59s -> 13323.59s]  Come on you can't be giving zebras alcohol
[13323.59s -> 13325.59s]  Cause then they just throw up out of their chest
[13325.59s -> 13327.59s]  Everybody knows this
[13327.59s -> 13329.59s]  That's why there's the law
[13329.59s -> 13331.59s]  Don't serve zebras
[13331.59s -> 13333.59s]  Someone's gotta put a stop to this
[13333.59s -> 13335.59s]  And there's only one thing that can stop this
[13335.59s -> 13337.59s]  And I think you all know what it is
[13347.58s -> 13349.58s]  That was a pretty good night out
[13349.58s -> 13351.58s]  Through all of our GTA videos
[13351.58s -> 13353.58s]  You just had the truck button bind
[13353.58s -> 13355.58s]  So at will
[13355.58s -> 13357.58s]  You just had
[13357.58s -> 13359.58s]  At free will
[13359.58s -> 13361.58s]  Would just be pressing a button
[13361.58s -> 13363.58s]  And it was always just a truck
[13363.58s -> 13365.58s]  You never did delete that
[13365.58s -> 13367.58s]  I bet you if you opened GTA 4 right now
[13367.58s -> 13369.58s]  On your computer
[13369.58s -> 13371.58s]  And you did like CTRL T
[13371.58s -> 13373.58s]  It would fucking work
[13373.58s -> 13380.22s]  It's probably still there
[13380.22s -> 13382.52s]  That's so fucking funny
[13382.52s -> 13384.52s]  Well that's it
[13384.52s -> 13389.00s]  I gotta go to the doctor
[13389.00s -> 13391.75s]  I mean I could give
[13391.75s -> 13394.12s]  Like a webcam
[13394.12s -> 13402.25s]  Like I could give an opinion
[13402.25s -> 13404.62s]  You always gotta make it weird
[13404.62s -> 13406.62s]  Alright
[13406.62s -> 13412.18s]  He's muted
[13412.18s -> 13414.18s]  No I'll let you say goodbye
[13414.18s -> 13416.18s]  Goodbye everyone
[13416.18s -> 13418.18s]  Thanks for letting me exist
[13418.18s -> 13420.36s]  On Jerma's stream
[13420.36s -> 13422.86s]  I normally don't exist
[13422.86s -> 13425.48s]  But this last hour of being out of the bottle
[13425.48s -> 13427.48s]  Has been very nice
[13427.48s -> 13429.48s]  Now get back in there until I have some more wishes
[13429.48s -> 13435.86s]  I left the call
[13435.86s -> 13439.38s]  That's just kind of what he does
[13439.38s -> 13442.65s]  But anyways
[13442.65s -> 13446.87s]  I will see you guys tomorrow
[13446.87s -> 13448.87s]  I gotta get out of here, I have to go to the doctor
[13448.87s -> 13453.54s]  That's what friends do
[13453.54s -> 13455.54s]  They make it weird on your stream
[13455.54s -> 13459.70s]  I don't make it weird
[13459.70s -> 13463.61s]  No I don't, I just go like this
[13463.61s -> 13465.61s]  That actually looks like
[13465.61s -> 13469.64s]  Look at how fucking bad that looks
[13469.64s -> 13471.64s]  That looks like fat and then like tiny
[13471.64s -> 13473.64s]  That's Popeye
[13473.64s -> 13476.33s]  That's worse than Popeye
[13476.33s -> 13485.16s]  This is what happens
[13485.16s -> 13487.16s]  This is what happens when you put on like the Walmart muscle suit
[13487.16s -> 13494.84s]  This is what you look like
[13494.84s -> 13498.36s]  Bad ratio
[13498.36s -> 13504.31s]  Alright guys
[13504.31s -> 13506.74s]  I will see you tomorrow
[13506.74s -> 13509.56s]  That didn't even pop up but you can hear it
[13509.56s -> 13511.56s]  Thanks to Star for joining us
[13511.56s -> 13513.56s]  And adding some insight to some of those videos
[13513.56s -> 13517.72s]  I'll see you tomorrow
[13517.72s -> 13519.72s]  We're gonna do the regular time tomorrow
[13519.72s -> 13521.72s]  I just had to start early and leave early because of the doctor
[13521.72s -> 13525.62s]  If you've taken off
[13525.62s -> 13527.62s]  Take care, see you tomorrow
[13527.62s -> 13529.62s]  We're probably gonna play Sam and Max tomorrow
[13529.62s -> 13531.86s]  We'll probably start Sam and Max season 3
[13531.86s -> 13533.86s]  Tomorrow at the regular time
[13533.86s -> 13539.82s]  And then after that
[13539.82s -> 13541.82s]  We'll see
[13541.82s -> 13543.82s]  There's a couple things I wanna do
[13543.82s -> 13553.66s]  So we will do them
[13553.66s -> 13555.66s]  But good night
[13555.66s -> 13557.66s]  Let's do the bits
[13557.66s -> 13559.66s]  Oh good night, right, it's not even like fucking 2 o'clock
[13559.66s -> 13564.01s]  3 o'clock
[13564.01s -> 13566.89s]  Let me scroll back here
[13566.89s -> 13579.75s]  To 4 hours ago
[13579.75s -> 13581.75s]  Raid Kiwo after the bits
[13581.75s -> 13584.44s]  Yeah that sounds, yeah we'll do that
[13584.44s -> 13594.10s]  What's Kiwo doing?
[13594.10s -> 13597.11s]  What's Kiwo up to? GTA?
[13597.11s -> 13600.18s]  Hey we entered on GTA but you might as well
[13600.18s -> 13602.81s]  Go see some more GTA
[13602.81s -> 13604.81s]  So we had, earlier we had
[13604.81s -> 13606.81s]  Anthrobots thanks to the 3 bucks anthrobots
[13606.81s -> 13608.81s]  No message
[13608.81s -> 13615.14s]  3 bucks, appreciate it
[13615.14s -> 13618.41s]  And then Freudian Weapon 250
[13618.41s -> 13620.41s]  Thank you Freudian
[13620.41s -> 13622.41s]  Can't stick around to watch live today, hope you're feeling better
[13622.41s -> 13624.41s]  Jeremy Hart, good luck at the doctor
[13624.41s -> 13626.41s]  Yeah this is a follow up to the colonoscopy stuff
[13626.41s -> 13630.18s]  So, one I can't really miss
[13630.18s -> 13634.09s]  But yeah, I'm feeling alright
[13634.09s -> 13636.09s]  I've had some stomach issues over the last couple days
[13636.09s -> 13638.09s]  That have just been annoying
[13638.09s -> 13644.62s]  But we'll see
[13644.62s -> 13647.88s]  Everything should be fine
[13647.88s -> 13649.88s]  Mitchell, thank you Mitchell for the 15 dollars Mitchell
[13649.88s -> 13653.27s]  Mitchell says
[13653.27s -> 13655.27s]  The glue man basketball video is easily
[13655.27s -> 13657.27s]  Top 5 videos you've ever been in
[13657.27s -> 13659.27s]  And the pissed off GM has to be
[13659.27s -> 13661.27s]  My favorite Jerma joke of all time
[13661.27s -> 13663.27s]  Thank you for everything that you've done
[13663.27s -> 13665.58s]  I love that video
[13665.58s -> 13667.94s]  That video is just
[13667.94s -> 13670.18s]  Everything about that video
[13670.18s -> 13672.36s]  But how long that video took
[13672.36s -> 13674.36s]  That's a 3 minute video, that's not a long one
[13674.36s -> 13676.36s]  Remember we were talking about, oh shit this video is fucking 3 minutes long
[13676.36s -> 13682.89s]  Which one?
[13682.89s -> 13684.89s]  That's the Gabe the glue man degrosie
[13684.89s -> 13687.90s]  Basketball video
[13687.90s -> 13691.10s]  What's that video called?
[13691.10s -> 13693.10s]  I think it's just called like Gabe degrosie
[13693.10s -> 13695.10s]  Like b-ball or something
[13695.10s -> 13702.26s]  I think I changed the title of it
[13702.26s -> 13704.26s]  A while ago because the first title
[13704.26s -> 13706.57s]  Was a little too
[13706.57s -> 13709.00s]  Like ambiguous so
[13709.00s -> 13712.78s]  It's like his origin story right?
[13712.78s -> 13720.01s]  But yeah thank you for the 15 dollars Mitchell
[13720.01s -> 13723.40s]  It's fun to do this
[13723.40s -> 13726.09s]  Because like I said before
[13726.09s -> 13728.09s]  When we did this last like a couple
[13728.09s -> 13731.35s]  Like a month ago or so
[13731.35s -> 13733.35s]  You just forget all these things that were interesting
[13733.35s -> 13735.35s]  That you thought were fun
[13735.35s -> 13737.35s]  And I'm like just reliving
[13737.35s -> 13739.35s]  Being in the game
[13739.35s -> 13741.35s]  By the way that game that people were asking
[13741.35s -> 13743.35s]  That like spy hacker in the slacker game
[13743.35s -> 13745.35s]  That was called a clandestine
[13745.35s -> 13747.35s]  Right clandestine clandestine
[13747.35s -> 13749.35s]  What's it called?
[13749.35s -> 13751.35s]  That's the name of that game
[13751.35s -> 13753.35s]  Somebody asked and I just didn't even think about it
[13753.35s -> 13758.73s]  But it's fun to do
[13758.73s -> 13760.73s]  Jerma has
[13760.73s -> 13762.73s]  A sexy voice thanks for the 15 dollars
[13762.73s -> 13765.61s]  Thank you

[13774.01s -> 13776.70s]  Really appreciate it
[13776.70s -> 13782.97s]  Marvash Mcgally thanks for the 250
[13782.97s -> 13784.97s]  Your patch notes video is basically a black mirror
[13784.97s -> 13787.98s]  Episode
[13787.98s -> 13792.65s]  Kind of
[13792.65s -> 13794.89s]  It may have
[13794.89s -> 13801.42s]  That was what like 2014
[13801.42s -> 13805.94s]  2015
[13805.94s -> 13813.48s]  Interesting
[13813.48s -> 13815.48s]  Thank you door cube for the 250
[13815.48s -> 13817.48s]  Door cube we watched that video
[13817.48s -> 13820.68s]  Feeling a bit sentimental
[13820.68s -> 13822.68s]  So here's some bits
[13822.68s -> 13824.68s]  Thank you for being so good and funny

[13862.57s -> 13864.57s]  Reminds me of the innocence of youth
[13864.57s -> 13866.57s]  Thank you for being such a positive influence

[13875.80s -> 13879.38s]  I really
[13879.38s -> 13882.39s]  Anytime somebody says this
[13882.39s -> 13890.26s]  I'm just glad you think that
[13890.26s -> 13894.81s]  I'm not perfect
[13894.81s -> 13896.81s]  Anytime I can hear somebody say that
[13896.81s -> 13898.81s]  It makes me not only feel good about the community
[13898.81s -> 13900.81s]  And about the channel and everything

[13925.11s -> 13930.68s]  I don't know

[13932.68s -> 13934.68s]  And go
[13934.68s -> 13936.68s]  That's up to you

[13982.47s -> 13985.74s]  Hey Jerma not much cash but I'm a bit strapped right now
[13985.74s -> 13987.74s]  Would you ever consider playing the game
[13987.74s -> 13989.74s]  Frostpunk
[13989.74s -> 13991.74s]  I think it would easily be funny to watch
[13991.74s -> 13993.74s]  Since forever and we'll keep watching
[13993.74s -> 13995.74s]  The heat till the heat death of the
[13995.74s -> 13998.49s]  Universe
[13998.49s -> 14000.49s]  I haven't really looked much into it
[14006.10s -> 14008.10s]  Frostpunk is an 8 out of 10
[14008.10s -> 14011.24s]  What's this
[14011.24s -> 14017.38s]  Nice like turkey
[14017.38s -> 14019.38s]  That's actually a turkey
[14019.38s -> 14035.26s]  Play Blade and Sorcery I already have
[14035.26s -> 14037.26s]  I've played it like 2 or 3 times already
[14037.26s -> 14039.82s]  I've played that already
[14039.82s -> 14044.79s]  But thank you Lycrae
[14044.79s -> 14046.79s]  Jerma lied about Taco Bell thanks for the 250
[14046.79s -> 14048.79s]  Who took the pictures for the privacy pile
[14048.79s -> 14063.43s]  That was me
[14063.43s -> 14065.43s]  Googly Gareth thanks for the 10 dollars Googly Gareth
[14065.43s -> 14068.12s]  Hey Jerma boy it's your old pal Googly
[14068.12s -> 14070.12s]  Field back with another donation and animation
[14070.12s -> 14072.12s]  Hope you enjoy it and thanks for all the
[14072.12s -> 14074.12s]  Laughs throughout the years
[14074.12s -> 14079.24s]  I'm going to have to play this
[14079.24s -> 14087.50s]  Right now
[14087.50s -> 14091.98s]  No I can't
[14091.98s -> 14093.98s]  I'm going to hold on to this till tomorrow
[14093.98s -> 14095.98s]  We'll play this tomorrow
[14095.98s -> 14098.54s]  This is like a 4 and a half minute video
[14098.54s -> 14102.44s]  I have to go to my doctors appointment
[14102.44s -> 14104.44s]  So tomorrow we're going to watch this
[14104.44s -> 14106.44s]  Jerma animated streaming super star
[14106.44s -> 14108.44s]  Source Filmmaker video
[14108.44s -> 14113.88s]  We'll probably just start with it
[14119.43s -> 14121.43s]  Those of you that want to see it before
[14121.43s -> 14123.61s]  There's the link
[14123.61s -> 14125.61s]  We're going to watch it on stream tomorrow afternoon
[14125.61s -> 14132.50s]  Tomorrow evening
[14132.50s -> 14134.50s]  But thank you Googly Gareth
[14134.50s -> 14139.43s]  Talented Source Filmmaker animator
[14139.43s -> 14142.25s]  We'll watch it tomorrow
[14142.25s -> 14144.25s]  Cereal Star thanks for the 10 bucks
[14144.25s -> 14146.25s]  Why not revisit some of the games in these really old videos
[14146.25s -> 14148.25s]  With stir on stream
[14148.25s -> 14150.25s]  Also hi I have my first thousand bits ever
[14152.62s -> 14154.62s]  We were talking about that
[14154.62s -> 14156.62s]  That it might be fun to go do some of these
[14156.62s -> 14158.62s]  That you didn't get to see the whole thing
[14158.62s -> 14160.62s]  You just got to see a little snippet of info
[14160.62s -> 14162.62s]  You got like 5 minutes of
[14162.62s -> 14164.62s]  Footage with it when there was like hours
[14164.62s -> 14166.79s]  Of stuff to see
[14166.79s -> 14168.79s]  Once there's not a whole lot of new games
[14168.79s -> 14170.79s]  And new material and new stuff coming out
[14170.79s -> 14172.79s]  Then we'll probably go back and try
[14172.79s -> 14175.74s]  Some of the old stuff again
[14175.74s -> 14180.60s]  Come into it
[14180.60s -> 14183.03s]  But thank you
[14183.03s -> 14185.72s]  Cereal Star
[14193.50s -> 14195.50s]  I'll PayPal him like fucking
[14195.50s -> 14197.50s]  I'll PayPal him some money
[14197.50s -> 14200.12s]  I'll buy him a fucking
[14200.12s -> 14202.36s]  Massage chair
[14202.36s -> 14204.36s]  No those are like 5 grand
[14208.58s -> 14210.58s]  I'll give him half those bits
[14210.58s -> 14215.13s]  That's fine
[14215.13s -> 14222.36s]  That's a vocal contract
[14222.36s -> 14224.36s]  No it is not
[14224.36s -> 14227.37s]  I just rejected it
[14227.37s -> 14229.37s]  It's time for slime thanks for the 20 dollars
[14229.37s -> 14231.67s]  Time for slime
[14237.67s -> 14241.96s]  There's like a couple of fucking great
[14241.96s -> 14243.96s]  Videos here
[14243.96s -> 14245.96s]  We'll start with this tomorrow
[14245.96s -> 14247.96s]  I just do have to get out of here in the next like 5 minutes
[14247.96s -> 14250.89s]  So I've got to run
[14250.89s -> 14252.89s]  But thanks for the 20 dollars
[14252.89s -> 14254.89s]  It's time for slime we'll open up with these two videos tomorrow
[14254.89s -> 14260.52s]  They look pretty interesting
[14260.52s -> 14263.98s]  Dr. Zoot Zoot thanks for the 5 dollars
[14263.98s -> 14265.98s]  Hey Jerma I can't watch for a week
[14265.98s -> 14267.98s]  Because I'm going to the San Diego Comic Con
[14267.98s -> 14269.98s]  I'm really nervous this year
[14269.98s -> 14271.98s]  And your infectious confidence in front of an audience
[14271.98s -> 14273.98s]  Is exactly what I need before I go
[14273.98s -> 14275.98s]  I won't say why but let's just say that
[14275.98s -> 14277.98s]  Any chat members who
[14277.98s -> 14279.98s]  Go to the masquerade at the con
[14279.98s -> 14281.98s]  Will know why very very plainly
[14281.98s -> 14283.98s]  See you in a week
[14283.98s -> 14285.98s]  Thanks again for being the cool internet uncle
[14285.98s -> 14288.79s]  I don't know what that means
[14288.79s -> 14290.79s]  But
[14290.79s -> 14292.79s]  Hope you have a good time
[14292.79s -> 14297.27s]  Thank you for the 5 dollars
[14297.27s -> 14305.40s]  Is it like a nervous thing?
[14305.40s -> 14310.14s]  Do you like dress up in a costume?
[14310.14s -> 14324.47s]  I don't know what that is
[14324.47s -> 14333.11s]  Is it a furry thing?
[14333.11s -> 14335.54s]  Oh I see
[14335.54s -> 14338.10s]  Well whatever
[14338.10s -> 14344.82s]  I'm not competing
[14344.82s -> 14352.06s]  What did I get furry for?
[14352.06s -> 14354.06s]  That's just what people were saying
[14354.06s -> 14356.06s]  I've just been trying to figure out what it is
[14356.06s -> 14366.30s]  Do you just believe random people?
[14366.30s -> 14368.30s]  Well when
[14368.30s -> 14370.30s]  Like 20 random people
[14370.30s -> 14372.92s]  Write the same thing
[14372.92s -> 14383.10s]  It's just a costume contest
[14383.10s -> 14385.10s]  He's going to dress up as a glue man
[14385.10s -> 14393.80s]  Hey thank you Clueless Sniper
[14393.80s -> 14395.80s]  For the 250 other than Jerma Rumble live action
[14395.80s -> 14397.80s]  Which video are you most proud of?
[14397.80s -> 14407.66s]  Most of them actually
[14407.66s -> 14409.66s]  Most videos I actually
[14409.66s -> 14411.66s]  Obviously
[14411.66s -> 14413.66s]  Making little jokes and talking shit about
[14413.66s -> 14415.66s]  Random videos but every video I've made
[14415.66s -> 14417.66s]  I was happy with
[14417.66s -> 14420.22s]  At the time you know
[14420.22s -> 14426.04s]  They can't all be perfect
[14426.04s -> 14428.04s]  But yeah maybe 20 percent or 30 percent of videos
[14428.04s -> 14430.04s]  I've made I wasn't like 100 percent happy with
[14430.04s -> 14432.04s]  But most of them I thought they were fun
[14432.04s -> 14437.29s]  Otherwise I wouldn't have
[14437.29s -> 14439.29s]  Uploaded them at the time
[14439.29s -> 14442.79s]  So that is the thing
[14442.79s -> 14444.79s]  Thank you Clueless Sniper
[14444.79s -> 14447.61s]  That was you
[14447.61s -> 14449.61s]  C4G thank you for the 250
[14449.61s -> 14451.61s]  Someone asked for the chart at the end of the
[14451.61s -> 14453.61s]  Coin game
[14453.61s -> 14455.61s]  Here it is
[14455.61s -> 14459.19s]  Pretty strong
[14459.19s -> 14464.70s]  That's a pretty strong chart
[14464.70s -> 14474.23s]  Let's take a look
[14474.23s -> 14488.95s]  This is from the coin game stream
[14488.95s -> 14490.95s]  That looks like some pretty steady growth
[14490.95s -> 14496.46s]  And then here is from tonight
[14496.46s -> 14501.45s]  Not bad either
[14501.45s -> 14503.45s]  There's a drop over here
[14503.45s -> 14507.61s]  What is this drop from?
[14507.61s -> 14521.82s]  This is from the coin game
[14521.82s -> 14523.82s]  As you can see it was pretty steady the whole time
[14523.82s -> 14528.87s]  Is that talk
[14528.87s -> 14530.87s]  Where Goat Simulator was played?
[14530.87s -> 14537.45s]  It is
[14537.45s -> 14541.72s]  Really?
[14541.72s -> 14543.72s]  That's when Goat Simulator was loaded up
[14543.72s -> 14550.23s]  Wow
[14550.23s -> 14557.26s]  Holy shit
[14557.26s -> 14559.26s]  These are so interesting to see
[14559.26s -> 14564.76s]  Goat Simulator was cool
[14564.76s -> 14572.63s]  That was a pretty good voice I think
[14572.63s -> 14574.63s]  But thank you
[14574.63s -> 14577.00s]  That was C4G
[14577.00s -> 14579.00s]  Thanks for the 250
[14579.00s -> 14581.00s]  21 like the number
[14581.00s -> 14583.00s]  These throwback streams are a blast
[14583.00s -> 14585.00s]  Hope they continue to be in every now and then thing
[14585.00s -> 14587.00s]  Just love and take care
[14587.00s -> 14595.51s]  They will
[14595.51s -> 14597.51s]  You'll probably see one of these once every few weeks
[14597.51s -> 14599.51s]  Once every like month or so maybe
[14599.51s -> 14601.69s]  The thing is though
[14601.69s -> 14603.69s]  Once we run out of videos it's kind of it
[14603.69s -> 14612.39s]  Or ones that I would want to watch
[14612.39s -> 14614.57s]  But thank you for the 250
[14614.57s -> 14616.57s]  Thank you Sim for the 317
[14616.57s -> 14618.57s]  They say bonus 31
[14618.57s -> 14621.19s]  Mostly thanks for the 250
[14621.19s -> 14623.19s]  Mostly lost
[14623.19s -> 14625.19s]  Raid someone you boomer
[14625.19s -> 14629.29s]  Let's get the credits on the screen
[14629.29s -> 14633.19s]  Thanks everybody for joining
[14633.19s -> 14642.33s]  See you tomorrow
[14642.33s -> 14644.33s]  We will start Sam and Max season 3
[14644.33s -> 14646.33s]  Probably do a couple of episodes
[14646.33s -> 14648.33s]  Here are all the subscriptions
[14648.33s -> 14650.33s]  All the new subs, all the old subs, all the community subs
[14650.33s -> 14652.70s]  Thank you guys
[14652.70s -> 14664.47s]  Thank you to all of you
[14664.47s -> 14667.48s]  And there are a couple more bits to do
[14667.48s -> 14669.48s]  We've got Dr. Clay for 250
[14669.48s -> 14671.48s]  I have an important message, they say pickles
[14671.48s -> 14675.13s]  And that's it
[14675.13s -> 14677.94s]  Pickles is the message
[14677.94s -> 14679.94s]  Thank you
[14679.94s -> 14681.94s]  Thanks for the 5 dollars
[14681.94s -> 14686.42s]  Sorry to bother
[14686.42s -> 14688.42s]  But we've been trying to find the solution to this dilemma
[14688.42s -> 14690.42s]  For a day, what picture is the spray
[14690.42s -> 14694.46s]  You're using here
[14694.46s -> 14696.46s]  That's an easy answer
[14696.46s -> 14698.46s]  That is burger boy on Halloween
[14698.46s -> 14700.46s]  Dressed as Ronald Mcdonald
[14700.46s -> 14705.13s]  From like
[14705.13s -> 14707.56s]  2008 or like
[14707.56s -> 14709.56s]  2009 or something
[14709.56s -> 14714.17s]  Thank you for the 5 dollars
[14714.17s -> 14716.17s]  Thank you Germas
[14716.17s -> 14718.17s]  For thank you for the 5 dollars
[14718.17s -> 14725.21s]  Thank you for 5 bucks
[14725.21s -> 14727.90s]  Reptio, thanks for the 15 dollars
[14727.90s -> 14729.90s]  Thank you for continuing to make such amazing content
[14729.90s -> 14735.45s]  I'm trying
[14735.45s -> 14737.45s]  Sometimes you swing and miss, sometimes you hit a home run
[14737.45s -> 14739.88s]  But I swing
[14739.88s -> 14741.88s]  Every god damn pitch
[14741.88s -> 14743.88s]  Which is probably not a good idea, but you know
[14743.88s -> 14751.82s]  Whatever
[14751.82s -> 14753.82s]  Probably a bad analogy, because that means I strike out
[14753.82s -> 14756.82s]  All the fucking time
[14756.82s -> 14758.82s]  I'm very patient at the plate
[14758.82s -> 14760.82s]  I take balls
[14760.82s -> 14763.64s]  I take strikes
[14763.64s -> 14765.64s]  The average is like fucking 500
[14765.64s -> 14770.18s]  But thank you Reptio
[14770.18s -> 14772.55s]  For the 15 bucks, my pleasure
[14772.55s -> 14775.62s]  Glad you enjoy it
[14775.62s -> 14777.62s]  And then finally Sprio, thanks for 250 Sprio
[14777.62s -> 14779.62s]  Hey Germas, I just want to thank you for everything
[14779.62s -> 14781.62s]  You've inspired me to start streaming
[14781.62s -> 14783.62s]  And for letting me join this amazing community
[14783.62s -> 14785.62s]  I've met my best friends from this community
[14785.62s -> 14787.62s]  You've honestly changed my life
[14787.62s -> 14789.62s]  Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart
[14789.62s -> 14793.40s]  Looking forward to your future endeavors
[14793.40s -> 14795.70s]  That's fucking awesome
[14795.70s -> 14801.06s]  I can't believe
[14801.06s -> 14803.06s]  It shocks me all the time
[14803.06s -> 14805.06s]  But it makes me really happy knowing
[14805.06s -> 14807.06s]  That this channel, this community
[14807.06s -> 14809.06s]  This group, this
[14809.06s -> 14811.06s]  My streams and my videos
[14811.06s -> 14813.06s]  Have been able to lead people
[14813.06s -> 14815.06s]  To meet some of their best friends
[14815.06s -> 14818.25s]  That's
[14818.25s -> 14820.25s]  What do you even say to that?
[14820.25s -> 14822.81s]  That's just fucking crazy to me
[14822.81s -> 14826.90s]  That's awesome, thank you so much
[14826.90s -> 14834.57s]  And we'll see you again tomorrow
[14834.57s -> 14836.57s]  I'll be back tomorrow
[14836.57s -> 14838.57s]  I'll see you at the regular times
[14838.57s -> 14840.57s]  That's Pacific, Sam and Max season 3
[14840.57s -> 14842.57s]  Time to go to the doctor
[14842.57s -> 14845.90s]  Good night, good bye
[14845.90s -> 14848.07s]  And we're going to raid Kibo
[14848.07s -> 14852.41s]  See you guys real soon
[14852.41s -> 14865.59s]  Take care, have a good one
