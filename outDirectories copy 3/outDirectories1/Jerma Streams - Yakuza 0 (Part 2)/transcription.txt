[0.38s -> 9.35s]  Okay, hi. So, I just wrote www.tv.tv. Oops. Hold on. Let me fix this.
[13.38s -> 20.18s]  www.tv.com. Whoever owns that domain, congratulations for the 500 trillion dollars
[20.18s -> 25.86s]  it took for somebody to buy that domain from you. What a shitty domain, too. Who cares?
[28.68s -> 39.88s]  Nobody's going to tv.com for any reason. The value of that domain was probably 50 million dollars.
[40.68s -> 50.62s]  In 2000. Not anymore. They sat on that for way too long if you didn't get rid of it.
[52.07s -> 56.68s]  Are you high? No. All right, let me just, let me tweet this. Hold on.
[61.11s -> 64.47s]  All right. Yakuza minigames. Pogchamp. All right, let's go.
[65.11s -> 74.57s]  How you doing? How's everybody doing today? Are we doing good? What are we looking at here?
[75.51s -> 84.04s]  All right, there's an image already. Get well. Oh, look at this. Really? Oh. Get well. Wish you
[84.04s -> 90.70s]  best soon. I'm going to put this on stream. This is cute. Well, thanks, guys. This is cute stuff.
[91.51s -> 109.74s]  I love the cute stuff. You see, this is a little get well card. Look at this. I don't deserve this.
[112.95s -> 119.77s]  Oh, this is cool. I thought that was a dick over there in the left. I'm not going to lie. I thought
[119.77s -> 134.01s]  that was just like a sagging dick with like one big ball, but it's a happy face. Don't be sexual.
[134.01s -> 145.38s]  Stop being sexual. I'm sorry, but I mean, you know what I'm saying? It's a little bit more
[145.38s -> 154.26s]  mature recently over the last few months, if you know what I'm saying. What does that say?
[155.96s -> 169.91s]  What does this say? Pog? Ipo happy. Oh, they're all... It's awesome. Thank you.
[172.79s -> 181.61s]  We're going to play more Yakuza and sorry if I sound sick. The thing happened where I got better.
[182.65s -> 188.81s]  I felt really fine last night and into this morning and I took a shower and then it got worse
[188.81s -> 193.93s]  and then it got better and then it got worse again. So don't mind me if I mute the microphone
[193.93s -> 202.01s]  sometimes and just like... It's probably going to happen. By the way, I just want to make sure
[202.01s -> 206.17s]  everybody knows this. If you weren't here the other day, I'm negative for COVID. I took a test
[206.17s -> 210.41s]  because, you know, if you're coughing, stuffy nose, headache, flu-like symptoms, it's like,
[210.49s -> 216.49s]  okay, I probably should get on top of this. No COVID. So that's pretty good, right? I'm happy
[216.49s -> 227.67s]  about that. So we'll just see how it goes. Odd bless. Yeah, I know, right? Yeah, we're going to
[227.67s -> 232.39s]  pick up right where we left off in Yakuza. I was in the middle of getting a potential bowling
[232.39s -> 244.12s]  girlfriend. So that's exciting. Very exciting stuff. I don't care about the story. I don't
[244.12s -> 250.04s]  care about the combat. I care about the bowling girlfriend. That's it. That's why I'm playing this
[250.04s -> 254.87s]  game a second time. Remember, do you like Yakuza? Yeah, it's pretty good. Why are you playing it
[254.87s -> 263.59s]  again? Well, you know... I require only one thing, okay? From in like a female interest.
[264.39s -> 269.14s]  And you want to come over and just like play Diablo 2 for like four hours or so and then
[269.14s -> 273.22s]  just like hang out, you know, whatever. That's all I require. That's the only thing I need.
[275.30s -> 283.05s]  That's it. Yeah, I heard about Vinny. That sucks. He'll be back though. He'll be back stronger than
[283.05s -> 305.85s]  ever. He'll be fine. He got a suspension. Yeah. He's showing potential nudity on stream. He'll be
[305.85s -> 316.55s]  back. I look forward to the next stream, Vinny. How could you not look forward to a Vinny stream?
[317.96s -> 326.39s]  They're all good. All right, let's go. He's not here. Well, he doesn't have to be here.
[327.19s -> 335.27s]  I like looked at like the viewer list. Is Vinny here? Oh, Vinny's awesome. He'll be back.
[335.99s -> 347.80s]  And I, how can I, why can this not work? No camera, right? No camera? Because I'm
[347.80s -> 360.04s]  naked. I'm not actually naked. I just don't have a top on because like fuck tops, right?
[361.10s -> 371.82s]  I wear bottoms. I don't wear tops. What the hell am I doing? Uh, what? Hello? Video game?
[373.21s -> 385.21s]  Video game? Um, I'd like to. All right, let's get back into Yakuza. I want to do mini games. I don't
[385.21s -> 391.22s]  really care about playing the game. Oh, if you missed it, we got a couple of dragons last time.
[391.22s -> 404.89s]  A couple of lizards. Uh, where's the health one? Oh, here we go. So I can send these to my item box,
[404.89s -> 419.02s]  right? How do I do that? Opponents? What the hell is all this? This is not bowling. Valuables.
[419.02s -> 424.94s]  Go to club sunshine. Hold on. I will. What was the next thing I had to do?
[424.94s -> 430.89s]  Wasn't it just have fun a bunch of times? Enjoy erotic videos. All right. Is this actually erotic
[430.89s -> 440.84s]  videos? What am I going to get banned? It's like, Oh, Vinnie got banned earlier for like nudity.
[440.84s -> 448.38s]  Like here. Am I going to, should I get banned too? Do I do it? What is going on with my controller?
[448.38s -> 459.88s]  Stop. What happened? Why does this thing suck? Oh, hold on. Can I ask you a few questions? All
[459.88s -> 472.17s]  right. We got stop, stop by a police officer. Stop and search, huh? This is the music. What's
[472.17s -> 478.97s]  your name and what do you do for a living? The name's Kiru. I'm in a hurry here and I'm also in
[478.97s -> 485.05s]  a hurry to read the fact that we've got five community subs from head full of crap. Thank you.
[485.05s -> 491.37s]  Head full of crap. Appreciate that. Excellent. Well, we've had some trouble around these parts.
[491.37s -> 496.55s]  Just to be sure. Would you mind if I checked your belongings? My thing's going to do with any trouble
[496.55s -> 500.92s]  around here. Relax. It's just a precaution. Can you show me what you're carrying?
[505.18s -> 509.10s]  All right. Is it more embarrassing to have a bunch of like lizard toys or Coke?
[509.66s -> 513.53s]  From the, you know what I mean? Like, why do you have like four lizard toys?
[514.25s -> 529.02s]  Okay. You win. What should I hand over? I mean, should I give them the lizard toy? All right. Here.
[531.14s -> 536.62s]  How about this? This is what I have. Hmm. This is about as safe as it gets. It doesn't look like
[536.62s -> 543.16s]  you're carrying anything dangerous here. Take this back. I got nothing to hide. Did he expect
[543.16s -> 548.82s]  me to hand him a gun or something? He didn't search me. He just said, hey, could you present
[548.82s -> 555.42s]  me with something? What? I could have had, what am I going to hand him the drugs in my pocket?
[556.22s -> 561.05s]  Thank you for your cooperation. Give me a break. Cops like you are always abusing your power.
[561.05s -> 564.01s]  You never stop to think about how much of an inconvenience this is for regular citizens.
[565.42s -> 569.74s]  Well, that may be so for other police officers. Not for me though. I'm only doing this because
[569.74s -> 576.47s]  it's all good. It's all I'm good for. Huh? What do you mean? Oh, never mind about me.
[576.47s -> 583.05s]  I'm the one asking the questions here. Huh? It doesn't make sense. I was sure you had something
[583.05s -> 589.42s]  big on you. I've got a nose for these things. Well, I guess your nose failed you this time.
[590.52s -> 610.58s]  By the way, is your nose broken? No. What the fuck? My sixth sense tells me I'll find something huge
[610.58s -> 617.61s]  if I dig deep enough. I don't know what to say. Why does that keep happening? I'm a pro at
[617.61s -> 621.85s]  stopping searches until I'm sure you're not a threat. I'm going to keep questioning you, okay?
[623.53s -> 628.57s]  Not okay. Oh, come on, Kiryu-san. Be a good sport. It won't take long. I just want to be sure.
[629.45s -> 633.91s]  I give up. Fine. Have it your way. Just keep it short. I mean, we'll keep it really short.
[633.91s -> 641.62s]  I'm trying to get into the porn theater. Come on. All right. Thank you. My name is Officer
[641.70s -> 647.62s]  Kikuchi. I'll see you around. Oh, I'm a friendship with Officer Kikuchi.
[648.50s -> 653.03s]  You got to know Officer Stop and Search Kikuchi. Interacting with him will gradually fill the
[653.03s -> 657.75s]  friendship gauge. You can check the status of this gauge at any time in the pause menu.
[658.39s -> 664.42s]  Build your friendship with Officer Kikuchi and see what happens. No, I don't think I will.
[666.81s -> 677.30s]  All right, porn theater. Do you bowl? If you bowl, then you and I are going to be good friends.
[682.02s -> 691.11s]  No, I'm not. Is this bad? You're going to watch Attack on Titan? Oh, shit. That's right. It comes
[691.11s -> 705.40s]  back. That's right. Isn't it like, yeah, maybe. Is it okay? At Gandhara, you can watch videos of
[705.40s -> 709.64s]  varied cast of gorgeous girls. As you meet these women out in the city under certain conditions,
[709.64s -> 714.04s]  new video content will be available. Search every corner of town to find your dream girl.
[718.41s -> 725.27s]  Hey, S. Ducks, thanks for the ten committed subs. That's a lot of money. Thank you. We charge
[725.27s -> 739.42s]  eight hundred dollars for one view. You're gonna actually stop Omega Lo. All right, I'm gone.
[739.42s -> 749.70s]  You're gonna get banned. Okay, I'm not gonna get banned. No, I'm not gonna get banned. I'm not
[749.70s -> 754.58s]  gonna see anything. All right, let's go. What's next on the list of things to do? It's soft core
[754.58s -> 761.32s]  porn. Okay. Well, you said the word porn. No, no, no, dude, don't worry. It's okay. It's soft core
[761.32s -> 772.78s]  porn. It's you said porn. Oh, shit. It's got histamine. Wait, because I bumped into him.
[781.48s -> 803.43s]  Nice. You can skip it if you have to. Yeah, let me skip it. Violence good, boobies bad. Hey,
[803.43s -> 810.63s]  I don't make the rules. All right, I just have to live by them. Yes, I know. I understand. I can
[810.63s -> 816.47s]  gouge a guy's eyes out with a knife in a horror game and pulls eyes out and eat him and squishes
[817.11s -> 821.99s]  blood will shoot out of the sides of my mouth and then I can like throw that guy off a cliff
[821.99s -> 827.83s]  and watch his body fucking roll and smash into rocks and his head smashes on the rock and the
[827.83s -> 833.19s]  back of his head explodes and then I climb down there like Gollum and I eat his brains and then
[833.19s -> 840.02s]  shit on him. But if like a nipple shows up on I got in trouble. I know I get it. I understand.
[843.48s -> 862.78s]  Look, I don't make the rules. Oh, wait, it's this guy again. I just walked around the circle.
[869.30s -> 875.91s]  What should I hand over? Oh, how about um, no, I don't want to give him my rare toys.
[876.63s -> 887.26s]  I don't have a gun. Oh, here. Oh, this looks really dangerous. What do you use this for?
[889.21s -> 891.85s]  It's not dangerous at all. Everyone carries around that sort of thing.
[893.22s -> 897.14s]  No, they don't. I'm beginning to suspect you might be a threat to public safety.
[897.14s -> 903.13s]  Kira-san, tell me what it's for. It's complicated. It is a very specific use.
[904.39s -> 909.67s]  And what would that be? You know, it's a little embarrassing so I didn't want to have to say it.
[909.67s -> 921.46s]  It's actually for. Yes. What happened? What are they doing? I've never heard about that before.
[921.46s -> 927.48s]  I guess I've led a sheltered life. What is that implying? I've used a gun?
[934.79s -> 936.47s]  I still get the feeling you're not being completely honest.
[939.21s -> 946.86s]  But you can go. Are we not friends? Oh, no, we're not friends.
[949.02s -> 953.06s]  All right, what am I supposed to be doing? I gotta go to the store.
[953.62s -> 962.84s]  I gotta buy some stuff. All right, let's go to the drugstore. Oh, shit.
[962.84s -> 982.95s]  I'm gonna go beast mode on this one. What's the graph for beast mode again? Holy shit.
[984.65s -> 990.23s]  That was awesome. You're not under any circumstances play Mahjong.
[991.75s -> 996.47s]  I'm going to. Unlike a lot of probably streamers that you've seen play this game,
[996.47s -> 1003.54s]  I know how to play Mahjong. I used to play it back in like 1996 on my old Windows 95 PC.
[1004.50s -> 1008.25s]  I know how to play Mahjong. Oh, why would I not play it?
[1014.07s -> 1016.07s]  Oh, this gives me a health boost. I'll take it.
[1023.93s -> 1040.07s]  The different Mahjong. I mean different. It's not the same Mahjong. What? It's different,
[1040.07s -> 1047.45s]  like solitaire different to what? Why would they do that? I only know how to play Mahjong classic.
[1050.84s -> 1053.24s]  What's that? What am I actually? How am I supposed to? How do I progress the game?
[1053.24s -> 1065.18s]  Can I pick him up off the ground? I can. What the fuck? I can pick him up by the legs.
[1066.14s -> 1077.91s]  And I can do like a bam bam. Oh, shit. Hold on. All right. If you see a guy walking at you with
[1077.91s -> 1083.19s]  a bike, I think you turn around and run. Because regardless of this person is strong,
[1083.91s -> 1087.43s]  it doesn't matter how tough this guy is. They're holding a bike in their hands in the air.
[1087.59s -> 1108.26s]  Oh, shit. Go back to the videos. You're a coward. Coward? Coward? You're saying I'm a coward?
[1110.71s -> 1113.83s]  What's what's what are we doing? What's what's this? What's going on here? Wait.
[1115.62s -> 1121.06s]  I like beast mode, but brawler is probably my favorite. Okay, I got four, three million.
[1121.06s -> 1129.85s]  Okay, hold on. A mighty knee strike. Old Y. Okay, that's cool. Max health. I'll take it. Yeah,
[1129.93s -> 1138.57s]  too bad. Max health. Go back to when I where I learned beast style.
[1141.21s -> 1152.12s]  Beast is the best. Beast is the best. 5% completion. Oh, my goodness. Wait, where's
[1152.12s -> 1161.16s]  the bowling alley? I want to go bowl. I go back to where I learned beast mode. I don't know what
[1161.16s -> 1175.78s]  that was. Best automatically picks up beast, picks up heavy items in the bowling alley.
[1175.78s -> 1185.10s]  Is it near the bowling alley? This is over here. Okay, I'll go to bowling alley. Yeah,
[1185.10s -> 1198.63s]  I'm not opening any links for at least the next 30 to 40 minutes. Understand? No links for 40 to
[1198.63s -> 1214.18s]  30 to 40 minutes. Beast mode is really fun. It's a big cleave. It's too slow, though.
[1223.30s -> 1227.14s]  It's back against the big bar. Oh, my goodness. That was horrible.
[1227.14s -> 1230.66s]  Oh, fuck. I'm sorry.
[1251.11s -> 1257.37s]  That's instantly dead. There's so many instant kill moves here. All right, bowling alley. Let's
[1257.37s -> 1270.95s]  go. And I'm gonna go visit my bowling alley and my bowling alley friend. Okay, so by the bowling
[1270.95s -> 1279.03s]  alley. This is where we did the advice for the band. Let me just see how she's doing. You know,
[1279.03s -> 1301.48s]  let me just check in on her. Wrong way. Let me see how she's doing. Okay, I got to act natural.
[1301.88s -> 1308.76s]  I came here specifically because I wanted to see her, right? I only came here to see her. But
[1309.32s -> 1314.36s]  what do we have on the street here? We have a drugstore. We have a video store. Okay,
[1314.36s -> 1317.64s]  I got to go into the video store. I got to go to the drugstore. I got to make sure I have a
[1317.64s -> 1325.02s]  bag that has the drugstore's name on it, right? Like, okay, CVS. I have a CVS bag and I'm holding
[1325.02s -> 1332.12s]  it with the logo out. Just get a fucking coconut water. Who cares? I got to walk in here with the
[1332.12s -> 1341.00s]  CVS bag facing her. Hey, what the fuck? What is going on here? Oh, yeah, I'm CVS. Yeah,
[1341.00s -> 1350.15s]  I was getting coconut water. I was on my break and just popping in. You're a serial killer. What?
[1350.87s -> 1376.20s]  What are you talking about? No, not. Oh, CVS. What? That's Dennis. What do you mean,
[1376.20s -> 1387.80s]  Dennis? And then I tap on the ... No, excuse me. Hold on a minute. Me and her are in a very, very ...
[1387.80s -> 1392.36s]  We're talking and we're hanging out. She's like, come back and see me. Come back and see me,
[1392.36s -> 1401.88s]  right? But I got to make it ... Look, I went to CVS, right? Come on. She wanted me. She told me to
[1401.88s -> 1405.96s]  come back five times. She's like, come back and see me. Come back and see me. I'm going to come
[1405.96s -> 1412.02s]  back and see you, but I went to CVS first, right? I just slam dunk you in fucking bowling.
[1414.47s -> 1423.03s]  Oh, yeah. I got time for a game. Oh, you're on break from work. You just went to CVS,
[1423.03s -> 1427.03s]  but you got time for a game? I mean, yeah, I do. Of course I do.
[1433.74s -> 1440.84s]  Where do you work? Oh, I mean, in here and there. A job. A lot of jobs, you know.
[1442.94s -> 1460.42s]  I'm on break. I'm on break for four hours. She's going to tell me to come back tomorrow. She's
[1460.58s -> 1463.30s]  going to say, hey, come back and see me tomorrow. And we're like, oh, yeah. You know, if I'm in the
[1463.30s -> 1468.42s]  area, I'm going to show up with like a bag of ... With a bag of like takeout. With a bunch of
[1468.42s -> 1474.18s]  food in my mouth. I was just getting takeout down street. I'm in the area. You wanted a baseball?
[1482.74s -> 1495.02s]  Ooh, that was bad. She's trying. Yeah. No. Okay. Excuse me. Me and her,
[1495.58s -> 1498.86s]  I've made it very clear that we're like trying ... We're like, want to talk to each other.
[1498.86s -> 1522.92s]  Let her win. Should I? All right. Is it too obvious if I just do this?
[1534.73s -> 1555.78s]  No, she'll think you're weak. She laughed. Yeah. Stop saying simp. I didn't say simp. You did. Who
[1555.78s -> 1572.86s]  is doing that? Stop saying that. God, she sucks. You have to rush her. No, I'm not going to just ...
[1572.86s -> 1591.58s]  I want it to be like fun. I just want to have fun. It's a close game. Oh, yeah. Let's go.
[1604.30s -> 1610.66s]  I can't wait till she shows up at like my work with like a bag of Doritos with like
[1610.66s -> 1639.48s]  the Doritos logo facing out. Sponsored. No. How would you be sponsored in like
[1640.12s -> 1660.52s]  just a regular day to day? What? A sponsored date? I think at that point, why do I feel like some
[1661.80s -> 1667.11s]  influencers do that? I just want to make sure ... Are you okay with that? This is a sponsored
[1667.11s -> 1672.23s]  date. Are you okay with me having like different logos, all these different toys and stuff around
[1672.23s -> 1680.44s]  the dinner table? I got sponsored by Hasbro. I have to like always carry around the toys with me.
[1683.46s -> 1688.74s]  Do you have to do that here? Yeah. It's part of the contract. Even when there's no cameras on?
[1689.30s -> 1717.96s]  Yeah. How will they know if you don't? Manly voice. My manly voice is like this. Okay. Did I
[1717.96s -> 1723.51s]  start talking like this more often? I'm not going to look at chat, but what I want someone to do
[1724.39s -> 1734.23s]  is I want them to count how many times the word stop in all capitals has been spammed.
[1735.99s -> 1742.50s]  I'm not going to keep track. I'm not going to look. I'm going to say two or 3000 times.
[1743.22s -> 1746.74s]  Something like that. I don't know. Whatever. I don't care. You think I care about that?
[1746.74s -> 1758.34s]  No. Why would I even look? I don't care. And time. Okay. How many times it was said?
[1762.87s -> 1768.87s]  Oh, an event is scheduled to take place at Mock Bowl. Your friendship with Emery will not increase
[1768.87s -> 1775.43s]  until then. You need to make progress with Kamarucha Real Estate Royale for the next event to start.
[1776.23s -> 1787.96s]  Unlocked as you... All right. Let's go. Okay. I got to go to the Real Estate Royale.
[1788.68s -> 1805.38s]  How do I do this shit? It's not unlocked. It's chapter five. Are you kidding me? It's like
[1805.38s -> 1816.39s]  chapter two right now. All right. How do I progress the story? Turn around. Do the story,
[1816.39s -> 1827.24s]  you cuck. Really? You're going to call me... Really? Well, now you're in big trouble. Now
[1827.24s -> 1834.04s]  you've lost a little bit of privileges here. I wish I could... You know what? You know what
[1834.04s -> 1840.20s]  I wish you could do on Twitch? I don't want to ban you. I don't want to ban you. I want to like
[1840.20s -> 1847.22s]  make it so you can't write the word cuck on this stream for like an hour. So you'll be like,
[1847.22s -> 1852.34s]  oh, whatever you say, cuck. Wait, it didn't work. I just blacked it out. Why? No, I want to say that
[1852.34s -> 1857.56s]  word. I want to just remove words from your vocabulary like that. You know what I mean?
[1857.56s -> 1863.54s]  You're not banned. You can stay. You can't say that anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ladies.
[1864.18s -> 1881.21s]  Ladies, I'm sorry. You can just blacklist the word yourself. Oh yeah, I can do that. No,
[1881.21s -> 1886.66s]  but I just want to make sure that person can't say it. And everybody else can spam it, but they can't.
[1887.30s -> 1896.36s]  All right, how do I play the game? How do I progress the story down the alley?
[1900.79s -> 1917.62s]  Oh shit, this is Yakuza. All right, let's bike somebody in the head. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[1917.62s -> 1937.66s]  All right. And you missed. Can I throw him up the stairs? No. Imagine getting thrown.
[1937.66s -> 1942.06s]  How do you go up the stairs instead of down the stairs? That would be worse than falling down the
[1942.06s -> 1950.87s]  stairs. Hey there, buddy. Been looking for you. You again. Got a lot of nerves showing up now.
[1950.87s -> 1956.58s]  What do you want? I think it's pretty clear what I want. Time to pay your protection money, pal.
[1957.64s -> 1961.16s]  If you're doing business in Komurocho, you're doing business with us.
[1962.18s -> 1967.14s]  The hell with that. It's not protection money if I don't show up to actually protect me when I need
[1967.14s -> 1974.06s]  it. And you have the gall to ask me for more? When you need it? What are you talking about?
[1975.11s -> 1979.75s]  I'm talking about Tachibana real estate. When they came and chased me out,
[1979.75s -> 1989.14s]  you people were nowhere in sight. Some protection. Tachibana? What? Oh, Tachibana real estate. Yeah.
[1989.86s -> 1996.50s]  They're, uh, look, it's complicated. Complicated my ass. You got scared and ran away.
[1997.30s -> 2004.58s]  What could be simpler? Scared? What? What do you think? Thanks to you, I had to relocate.
[2004.58s -> 2007.94s]  Now I'm scrambling to get new customers to make up for all these ones I lost
[2008.58s -> 2013.62s]  and pay you even if I wanted to. I think you better keep that attitude in check, asshole.
[2014.92s -> 2023.10s]  Mind if I cut in? Huh? What do you want? Who are you? What family are you with?
[2024.26s -> 2030.66s]  I'm not in anybody's family. Pipe down. It's this guy I'm talking to. So he said it's a four kids
[2030.66s -> 2044.79s]  dub. Excuse me? What do you want from me? You say you opened shop here because Tachibana
[2044.79s -> 2051.30s]  real estate forced you out at your last location. Is that right? Oh, I see what this is. You're
[2051.30s -> 2058.41s]  trying to be this guy's new muscle. Oh, hell no. What? Our family's handled this cafe's protection
[2058.41s -> 2065.83s]  for 30 years. You try to swoop in on our turf, it'll mean war. Look, looks like you might need
[2065.83s -> 2072.95s]  some convincing to stay quiet while I speak to the owner here. Shut your mouth and try me. I'll kill
[2072.95s -> 2090.06s]  you. Go, go, go. Hey, Rainbow, thanks for the vibe. Give you a dirty job. Ooh. God, you just got
[2090.06s -> 2096.06s]  triple quadruple summers off him. Saying words to make the YouTube video more funny.
[2096.06s -> 2099.18s]  Saying words that are out of context to make the YouTube video funnier.
[2100.14s -> 2112.74s]  You've just got Slam-a-lam-a-ding-dong on your skull, Camarito. Say hello for the glass, ass.
[2114.02s -> 2124.49s]  Let's do it again on his little mouth. This time hit him right in the mouth.
[2126.79s -> 2130.55s]  You're my favorite YouTuber. Hey, thanks. Appreciate that. Thank you. I'm serious.
[2141.02s -> 2151.67s]  Ned Flanders? What the hell? I'm not losing to some kid. You just did. Now get lost and don't show
[2151.67s -> 2158.82s]  your face around this guy's shop again. Damn it. This ain't over. Why do we all, why do we talk the
[2158.82s -> 2166.06s]  same? God doesn't even realize. We all talk like this. You know what I mean? What the fuck is he
[2166.06s -> 2171.72s]  talking about? We can finally talk in peace. So, what in the end are you just talking in this place
[2171.72s -> 2177.35s]  as this guy squeezed me for protection, huh? Can you just leave me alone? I already said it wasn't
[2177.35s -> 2183.93s]  like that. I'm not even Yakuza. I'd just really like to talk for a minute. Talk about what? Not you
[2183.93s -> 2188.65s]  bound in real estate. Doing a little investigation. And I'd like to tell me if you know anything.
[2188.65s -> 2194.01s]  Anything's fine. What I know isn't a hell of a lot. Besides, I'd prefer never to deal with
[2194.01s -> 2215.86s]  those guys again. They're terrifying. Terrifying how? Too much CVT. Stop doing the H1, Z1 voice?
[2222.26s -> 2228.90s]  I'm doing the, I'm a, I'm like a character in a television show that's animated and full of
[2228.90s -> 2237.35s]  people. Ask me for the play, kid. Hey, thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate it.
[2239.24s -> 2245.29s]  You know, I haven't said that in probably seven years. PBS four kids animated voice. Well, let
[2245.29s -> 2249.66s]  me pay attention. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Where would I go if I
[2249.66s -> 2255.30s]  want to meet the guy from Tachibana's office who paid you that visit? Probably still there,
[2255.30s -> 2260.58s]  finishing what they started. Still where? Fuck, I'm still doing it. I'm sick though. It's my
[2260.58s -> 2264.42s]  excuse to talk like this because like I can do it today. I can't do it any other day because I'm not
[2264.42s -> 2277.00s]  sick. Ooh, okay. They drove most of the tenants out. The place is practically empty. And he's still
[2277.00s -> 2281.66s]  there. Probably. They're making him all kinds of sweet deals, but he turned down every last one.
[2282.30s -> 2287.82s]  He's still there now. Tachibana's boys will be too. Go have a look if you really want to get
[2287.82s -> 2293.86s]  mixed up with them. Okay, thanks. Appreciate it. Tachibana's been running tenants out of the Hakua
[2293.86s -> 2302.44s]  building on Shichifuku Street. It's worth checking out. Thanks for the info. I just turned,
[2302.44s -> 2307.32s]  I turned and not paying attention, just turned and just hit my head square into this thing
[2307.40s -> 2329.29s]  and fall flat on my back and in a coma for the rest of the game. I've literally done that. I've
[2329.29s -> 2335.69s]  too. How many times have you guys in your own house somehow taken a corner too sharply
[2336.49s -> 2347.98s]  and just your shoulder just smashes into the corner like of the doorway? Yeah, it happens. It sucks.
[2351.82s -> 2354.94s]  But then you get really annoyed with yourself because you're like I live here. How do I not
[2354.94s -> 2366.14s]  know how to do these corners correctly? Oh my God. Hard door, hard door, hard door.
[2367.42s -> 2398.92s]  All right, come here. Hard door. Beast car door. All right, let him go. Come here. I got like stuck
[2398.92s -> 2406.84s]  on the whatever. I grabbed him over here and I couldn't like push him back and then he got away.
[2406.84s -> 2422.14s]  And then like my controller got like locked. You get this. This is a game where you get like stuck
[2422.14s -> 2443.29s]  on stuff. Notice that it's very, it's very like clingy. And here we go.
[2447.69s -> 2466.44s]  No sticky keys? No. What if I need them? Hmm. Here we go. I can like, I can mute the microphone
[2466.44s -> 2498.86s]  and cough like 10 minutes straight. I'll be right back. Okay, hi. Okay, who's in here? I get some
[2498.86s -> 2519.14s]  story. I run the place. Wait, is this the bathroom? Why is he like opening the door like he's sitting
[2519.14s -> 2536.36s]  on the toilet? Like get out here. I'll drop you out of the building. Okay, I'll take care of that.
[2549.56s -> 2557.88s]  What is this? Hold on here. I don't even know why I'm laughing. It doesn't make any sense.
[2568.34s -> 2571.22s]  Off your phone? I'm not on my phone.
[2579.05s -> 2583.21s]  I don't want to rate Twitter. Like I don't want to rate the app. Like fuck off.
[2583.21s -> 2591.46s]  It's been like seven years since I've owned this. Like if I haven't done it yet, I'm not going to.
[2603.83s -> 2611.75s]  Streaming, shouting, pissing the halls.
[2615.83s -> 2621.35s]  Can't put the phone down to stream. Yes, I just did. I just have to check my notifications, man.
[2625.43s -> 2633.99s]  Oh, I can't wait to drag somebody's head across that bar.
[2639.56s -> 2664.02s]  He just opened that like there was a bee in his room. He just like just opened a door and run.
[2664.02s -> 2665.22s]  Eventually, maybe he'll leave.
[2685.64s -> 2689.64s]  So
[2695.80s -> 2703.64s]  Irma hair? Not anymore.
[2707.94s -> 2710.42s]  It's like the exact same haircut I had like a year ago.
[2716.46s -> 2731.54s]  Oh shit.
[2743.10s -> 2749.21s]  How much is that?
[2756.47s -> 2759.83s]  Oh shit, he's giving it back.
[2774.52s -> 2775.24s]  Oh shit.
[2780.38s -> 2791.03s]  Another two million. It's like Oprah. He's just going to be like are we going to get cars too?
[2798.58s -> 2809.93s]  Oh, it's the money that you lost at baseball.
[2814.26s -> 2832.12s]  Wait, was it a debate?
[2841.88s -> 2842.60s]  Wasn't even real.
[2847.54s -> 2874.06s]  I have 20 million dollars in brawler. What are you a rush guy looks like.
[2875.10s -> 2876.30s]  He pushes me really fucking hard.
[2890.66s -> 2895.06s]  Russia's op was fucked. So I picked the wrong one.
[2921.37s -> 2922.33s]  Fetish stream.
[2926.38s -> 2928.62s]  Sorry, I laughed when he left.
[2938.70s -> 2939.90s]  But I'm I like brawler mode.
[2946.36s -> 2948.12s]  Oh shit, this is ugly.
[2963.59s -> 2966.63s]  Guys, hold on. I play in the bathtub. I was just rinsing my hair.
[2967.51s -> 2971.11s]  I just said I've had the conditioner in for the last 51 minutes.
[2971.11s -> 2992.06s]  I'm just shaking up a drink. I have a little drink here. I have like a little. I need to get. I don't know. Whatever. Don't leave me alone. Watch the game. I'm coughing.
[3005.40s -> 3011.56s]  Okay, I'm trying to be cool.
[3026.60s -> 3030.76s]  How did I do that? I just like shook up a drink and got like embarrassed that you heard it.
[3036.58s -> 3044.26s]  Let me pay attention. Hold on. Leave me alone. You're gonna be in big trouble.
[3070.14s -> 3084.73s]  Close chat during Kai Canyon.
[3088.89s -> 3089.93s]  I read what somebody said.
[3101.51s -> 3103.75s]  Okay, real estate company willing to make an enemy of the.
[3104.71s -> 3109.91s]  Of the Tojo clan, the owner of Cafe Blend may have been right about them being worse than the Yakuza.
[3110.39s -> 3115.27s]  I want a bit more info. Hopefully I can track down those other homeless guys in this neighborhood.
[3115.27s -> 3118.31s]  Usually see them hanging around Park Boulevard and maybe I'll start there.
[3121.27s -> 3126.46s]  Find the homeless men flat on back.
[3133.11s -> 3138.57s]  Old material. It was like 20 minutes ago.
[3139.61s -> 3144.41s]  It's not old material if it happens in the same stream. It's a closed environment here.
[3145.77s -> 3157.08s]  Get me this. Nice heat mode.
[3158.20s -> 3170.74s]  Fuck, that happened so quickly. I don't even know what's going to happen. Use the railing.
[3170.74s -> 3179.11s]  All right, let's go. Come here. Did it work?
[3182.23s -> 3200.06s]  Yeah, come here. Yeah. Corner of the railing. Holy shit, that was a cool move.
[3200.62s -> 3218.47s]  He's crazy strong. I am. Hey, I have to ask you guys a couple of questions.
[3226.54s -> 3236.46s]  If I did, I'd be doing them myself. Speaking of, I hear Saku-san just got back from that
[3236.46s -> 3241.42s]  gig for a touch about real estate. Serious? Lucky bastard. You think he'd cut me in on
[3241.42s -> 3245.98s]  some of that if I asked him? Who knows? Can't hurt to ask. I guess he's probably over at
[3245.98s -> 3254.34s]  Public Park 3 with his buddies. I just had like a funnel in my ear leaning.
[3258.28s -> 3273.37s]  Hmm. Stop eating spaghetti in the bathtub. Why would I eat spaghetti in the bathtub?
[3274.01s -> 3275.61s]  It's me. Yeah, it's me. What do you want?
[3282.26s -> 3290.28s]  Oh, come on. Who am I? Hey! Oh shit, I thought this guy was attacking me.
[3292.87s -> 3296.23s]  Like, come on, dude. Please. You're too close to the fight.
[3297.35s -> 3316.52s]  You eat spaghetti in the bathtub? I don't. I feel like that's like a weird YouTube video
[3316.52s -> 3321.00s]  you watched where it was like I made a bathtub with spaghetti sauce and like ate spaghetti
[3321.00s -> 3329.53s]  in the bathtub with this with the tomato sauce or something. Oh, not this guy again.
[3329.53s -> 3339.30s]  No, just get away from me. Here. Look, I have a- here, look. Isn't this cute? You made that
[3339.30s -> 3343.54s]  video. No, I didn't. I made a video where like- I made a video where I sat on a gun in the bath.
[3343.54s -> 3350.60s]  Different. This is about as safe as it gets. It doesn't look like you're carrying anything
[3350.60s -> 3360.65s]  dangerous. In the bathtub when I have like the TF2 video. How many- wait, how many of you guys
[3360.65s -> 3364.33s]  have like never seen any of my videos before? What's like the over-under of how many people
[3364.33s -> 3385.56s]  are here? You made videos? Tons of them. Hundreds of them, dude. Kicked somebody's bike. Sorry.
[3386.36s -> 3409.85s]  Come here. Come here. He did- he went- he hit his head on something. Why did he hit his head on?
[3410.65s -> 3419.37s]  I just unplugged that guy from his internet. Somebody's pulled the ethernet cable out when
[3419.37s -> 3447.03s]  he ran at me. Actually, I gotta save the game. Geez. Do the RC car racing? Ending machine. Yes,
[3447.03s -> 3465.26s]  sure. You pay 10,000 yen. Inokitake. Cool. I ate it? Inokitake mushrooms are recommended by
[3465.26s -> 3485.80s]  mushroom suppliers. Cool. All right, I used it. I have to- where's my item box? Get rid of this
[3485.80s -> 3498.17s]  stuff. What is this? Tissues? All right, where's this pocket racing game you're talking about?
[3498.17s -> 3519.03s]  Do pocket racers? Is there a drug store in here? Sorry. I'll take a beef bottle down here.
[3522.55s -> 3535.53s]  The north top left of the map? Okay. You just ate mushrooms, now you want more drugs. Yeah,
[3535.53s -> 3552.95s]  whatever. Okay, north- north left. North left of map. Batting center. Disco. I don't have it. I
[3552.95s -> 3565.19s]  don't think I have it unlocked. No, I don't- I don't have that yet. You think if you made the
[3565.19s -> 3568.55s]  exact same sound as the person that just got bumped, if it was like somebody running down the
[3568.55s -> 3572.07s]  street they bumped into you and the person went, oh yowzers! And then they bumped into you and you
[3572.07s -> 3580.46s]  went, oh yowzers! You think you'd look at each other? Be like, dude, you- you're- do you want
[3580.46s -> 3584.12s]  to hang out? I feel like we kind of get each other somehow.
[3595.90s -> 3598.38s]  Was this supposed to be a sweet little year-end bonus this calls for toast?
[3601.74s -> 3614.18s]  Yeah, we deserve to forget all the bad crap for one day. Let's live it up. Eat your shit together.
[3614.18s -> 3618.34s]  Stop eating a candlelit dinner in the bathtub. Do not tell me how to live my life. I can do
[3618.34s -> 3623.54s]  whatever I want. I can do whatever the fuck I want. I can eat a candlelit dinner in the bathtub if I
[3623.54s -> 3632.02s]  feel like it. How is that hurting you? How does that hurt you? How does that hurt you? In no way
[3632.02s -> 3660.12s]  does it affect you. You can do whatever the fuck I want. What? Hmm. If only I had some booze that
[3660.12s -> 3670.26s]  thought right out. If you're that eager to chat, buy us around. Sure, let's go. Let's do it.
[3671.58s -> 3674.30s]  Put the fuck up with dumbass boys references.
[3677.26s -> 3683.90s]  Hold on a second, folks. Ladies and gentlemen, um, you don't- that's a good show.
[3685.58s -> 3690.86s]  If you haven't seen the boys yet, fucking watch it. Like, it's a really cool- it's a good show.
[3690.86s -> 3695.99s]  It's based on a- I mean, no, no, it's not a good show. I don't like that show. I don't like the
[3695.99s -> 3712.68s]  boys. Well, I do. Comics are good, too. Yeah, I might read them. Great acting. It's like,
[3712.68s -> 3716.04s]  it's really, really all over the place. It's really, like, dark and gritty and- yeah,
[3716.04s -> 3721.64s]  oh, you said the Reddit word. It's like, dark and gritty show. Excuse me. Excuse me.
[3721.64s -> 3732.28s]  No, it's actually- well, jokes aside, it's a really good show. It's just fun to watch.
[3735.74s -> 3739.98s]  Um, Anthony Starr better get the, uh, like, an Emmy because, like, he's fucking fantastic.
[3739.98s -> 3753.45s]  Anthony Starr? Yeah, he's fantastic. He's really fun to watch. I'm being dead serious. All right,
[3753.45s -> 3762.94s]  we gotta bring him some booze. Do I have- can I just buy booze? This is a bit. Don't fall for it.
[3762.94s -> 3773.94s]  It's not a bit. All right, let's go. Let's go. Beer's easy. They sell it everywhere. Let's go get a
[3773.94s -> 3783.34s]  bunch of beer. Okay, uh, soba noodles burger shop? Wait, there's a- this- wait,
[3783.34s -> 3789.85s]  there's cheeseburgers in the game. Hold on, I didn't even see that. Talk to all of them.
[3791.61s -> 3804.66s]  All right, so you want a beer. You want a beer? What do you want? Uh, sweet potato sochu mood.
[3804.66s -> 3810.15s]  Somebody write that down. Potato sochu. Sweet potato sochu is the only sochu worth drinking.
[3810.87s -> 3814.79s]  You're one of those kids who only drinks beer. You gotta expand your horizons. You'll never get
[3814.79s -> 3831.19s]  a woman. All right, so we're getting a coke for you. Something like sake to warm you up
[3831.19s -> 3836.04s]  in the winter. Sake is that- what was that blinking over there? What was that? Check that out.
[3836.60s -> 3854.22s]  All right, yeah, I like sake. Warm sake is good. Okay, hot sake. What do you want? Champagne.
[3855.40s -> 3864.28s]  Ensy, okay. Christmas. Probably have some at Don Quixoto. Okay. You guys writing these down?
[3867.77s -> 3874.30s]  Ehehe. Ehehe. Didn't expect a free drink. Life's just great. Well, I'm a whiskey hound.
[3874.86s -> 3889.32s]  Okay. Make sure it's scotch. What does it mean? My girlfriend are watching and we want to hear
[3889.32s -> 3896.38s]  the Dutch voice. Like your anniversary or something? Is it- okay, if it's your anniversary, then
[3897.77s -> 3908.87s]  if it is, okay. Well, listen to me, Arthur. Arthur, you have to get on that train and start up a fight
[3908.87s -> 3927.53s]  with those bandits before I can get on to that train with you. Happy anniversary, guys. You got
[3927.53s -> 3933.03s]  the- no, wait, hold on, I screwed up my thing. Yeah, I'm not gonna say Goku at the end of every
[3933.03s -> 3943.46s]  one of those, man. All right, so we need champagne. Let's get this right. We need potato, drink,
[3944.34s -> 3955.94s]  champagne, scotch, beer. What was the last one? Potato drink, scotch, champagne, beer,
[3955.94s -> 3971.26s]  sake. Okay, easy. I can't just go into the- no!
[3975.02s -> 3980.82s]  I gotta get on that train so I can get on the train, Arthur, so I can get on the train with you.
[3982.10s -> 3985.86s]  Really, really reaching deep into the- hold on, I gotta call in this guy.
[3994.95s -> 4007.61s]  Giant traffic cone. Pog. I want to go to the burger place first. Do they actually have cheeseburgers?
[4007.69s -> 4019.26s]  Oh, will this be for here to go? This is for here. Free smile? What? All right, a smile burger,
[4020.14s -> 4027.02s]  smile cheeseburger with fries, teriyaki smile burger, a king smile burger. This is like a big
[4027.02s -> 4039.66s]  mac. Una burger, a smile shake. I want the smile cheeseburger set. I'm so hungry, I'm eating my
[4039.66s -> 4051.99s]  hands in anticipation. All right, what about the smile? Free smile. I have a free smile. Here it
[4051.99s -> 4065.13s]  comes. Oh, I thought the smile was like the name of the drink. Excuse me, can I have a free drink?
[4065.77s -> 4087.83s]  You don't sell alcohol here, I'm leaving. This is a real thing, you can ask for a smile in Japanese
[4087.83s -> 4104.60s]  McDonald's. What? That's- you can? Okay, I need to get a beer, open noodles. Oh, drinks, okay.
[4104.60s -> 4110.39s]  Let's go up and left. So you just go- excuse me, I'd like a smile- what if you don't order anything?
[4110.39s -> 4113.83s]  I think that's kind of fucked up. You should have to- you should have to at least have to order food.
[4113.83s -> 4119.27s]  Otherwise, there'd be a line out the door like, can I have a smile? Sure, thanks for taking up
[4119.27s -> 4129.51s]  a fucking space in line, dickhead. Like, imagine like the- you're like in a rush, you're in a hurry,
[4129.51s -> 4135.27s]  and like the four or five people in front of you are ordering smiles for free. It's like,
[4135.27s -> 4140.07s]  okay, that's very cute. Get the fuck out of my way. I would like to order a meal, please.
[4140.71s -> 4155.66s]  I'm- I'm gonna pay- I'm gonna be ordering food. Oh, this is beer, right? Enjoy the moment with
[4155.66s -> 4164.44s]  full body flavor. All right, so we need this as draft. This beer tastes incredible. In which
[4164.44s -> 4174.89s]  takoyaki would you like? What? Do I have to buy food with this? Takoyaki and egg. I'm too full
[4174.89s -> 4181.21s]  for this. No, I can't eat. What if I don't want this? No, I don't want to drink the guy's beer.
[4181.21s -> 4193.16s]  Wait, what? Okay, well that was not right. I go up with like five empty containers, shit face.
[4193.88s -> 4215.82s]  Did you get our orders? I sure did. Okay, you're all shit. Okay, come on. You know, do you sell
[4215.82s -> 4228.98s]  beer here? Just show up with five cartons of milk. Oolong tea. Wait, whiskey. Is it scotch?
[4229.62s -> 4241.74s]  Oh, sweet potato. That's expensive. This is $1,800. Oh, friendship. Hold on a minute.
[4241.74s -> 4246.50s]  Hold on a minute. Excuse me. You seem a little tense. I just started working here, so
[4247.86s -> 4252.02s]  this takes a while to get used to it and learn about all the different products. Well, good luck.
[4253.29s -> 4259.85s]  Thank you, sir. How much kinder than you look. I am? What kind of look do I have then?
[4262.26s -> 4268.18s]  I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. It's fine. My name is Miho. If you come here often,
[4268.18s -> 4271.38s]  we'll be seeing each other a lot. So I thought I should introduce myself.
[4272.78s -> 4281.96s]  Nice to meet you, Miho. I'm Kiro. Okay, new contact. This could be the beginning of a
[4281.96s -> 4299.14s]  friendship with Miho. All right. You're cheating on bowling girl. No, here, I'm going to buy stuff
[4299.14s -> 4304.82s]  from here to talk to this girl. I'm going to bring the bag of this logo with this brand on it
[4304.82s -> 4325.03s]  to the bowling alley. Psycho. All right, what else do they have? Delete System 32. That's not even
[4325.03s -> 4328.39s]  like, why are you even saying that anymore? It's been like 10 years since somebody did that.
[4329.83s -> 4334.15s]  You got like, okay, somebody got one person to do that like 15 years ago and people still say that.
[4335.74s -> 4351.53s]  Does this count as scotch? Get the malt. Okay, this is beer. Wait, I just have to buy things
[4351.53s -> 4358.07s]  from here and we can, all right, sure. Here. I'd like a couple more things too. I'd like some ramen.
[4361.08s -> 4369.67s]  Cool. I'd like, that's what I want from here. Every time I buy something, you like it. I'll
[4369.67s -> 4382.71s]  take a seaweed rice ball. Cool. Okay. I'll also have a, you know, hey, I'll take a couple of,
[4382.71s -> 4386.39s]  these are expensive so I can show you that I got a little bit of cash. I'll take two of those.
[4389.86s -> 4400.20s]  Okay. Also, I'll take some health potion. I'm going to buy one at a time because it makes you
[4400.20s -> 4403.00s]  happy when I buy one item at a time and I need help anyways.
[4413.59s -> 4420.71s]  Okay, so I have a, this is a separate trip. Oh, no, that won't work. Oh, Kirsten, hello.
[4427.62s -> 4432.23s]  Oh, sorry. Thank you for shopping with us. Looks like she's got something on her mind.
[4432.79s -> 4436.23s]  Something wrong? You look a little out of it. Oh, do I really?
[4437.51s -> 4442.97s]  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have let that show, but you're right. Something's been on my mind all day.
[4443.93s -> 4450.15s]  What's that? Head office gave me an assignment of sorts. An assignment, huh? We have lots of
[4450.15s -> 4454.31s]  competition here from the M store chain and others. Our stores are all very similar,
[4454.31s -> 4458.79s]  don't you think? But think of it, I guess there's not much of a difference between your store.
[4459.91s -> 4463.42s]  That's why the head office asked employees from various branches to come up with ideas that would
[4463.42s -> 4471.16s]  set Poppo stores apart from others. That's why you're lost in thought. Okay. I don't want to
[4471.16s -> 4474.28s]  suggest something random that would only grab the customer's attention for five minutes.
[4474.76s -> 4485.53s]  Silly me, I should ask customers for their opinions. Do you have a few minutes?
[4485.53s -> 4493.56s]  No, of course I do. Great. So, Kirsten, is there something, is there anything that you would,
[4493.56s -> 4505.10s]  God damn it. Okay. Is there anything that you would like? Oh, man. Is there anything
[4505.10s -> 4509.58s]  you would like our store to introduce? Let me think. What would I want at a convenience store?
[4510.38s -> 4520.04s]  I would want sofas, luxury brand goods, also delivery service. How about delivery?
[4520.76s -> 4524.55s]  That would be pretty good, right? Let's do delivery.
[4526.63s -> 4532.71s]  If stores all across Japan, you could use that to offer a delivery service. Oh my gosh,
[4532.71s -> 4536.47s]  that's a good idea. Why go to the post office or arrange a curry if you could mail or pick up
[4536.47s -> 4540.71s]  parcels at the same store you do your shopping in. Oh, I got it wrong. I thought they were going to
[4540.71s -> 4544.79s]  be delivering food and like sprites and stuff to people, not like actually do like mail,
[4545.51s -> 4553.77s]  like handle mail. Okay. It still worked. You could also offer a range of discounts
[4553.77s -> 4558.86s]  to further entice the customers. Your idea is going to be a winner. You must be a business
[4558.86s -> 4574.71s]  genius. Okay. All right. Friendship ended with bowling girl. Now store girl is my best friend.
[4585.29s -> 4593.29s]  Good one. Oh, more friendship, friendship, friendship again.
[4593.69s -> 4618.58s]  And he bought the whiskey. Almost there. Oh, I shared your suggestions about offering parcel
[4618.58s -> 4624.10s]  delivery service with that office and they jumped on the idea. I even got a raise thanks to that.
[4624.90s -> 4629.46s]  Hey, that's great. But it was your idea to begin with. So I owe you a big thank you.
[4629.46s -> 4640.23s]  I got you this. Hope y'all like it. You got a berserker charm. Oh shit. This is going to be a
[4640.23s -> 4645.96s]  new hot snack here available soon. Nice. Yeah. Congratulations. We're starting to sell this
[4645.96s -> 4650.44s]  today. Can you guess what it is? Let me give you a hint. It's delicious by itself or with soy sauce
[4650.44s -> 4657.05s]  or mustard. It's a specialty from the Nagoya area. It goes well with soy sauce and mustard.
[4657.05s -> 4671.48s]  It must be hot miso soup, steamed pork buns. It goes well with soy sauce and mustard. That's
[4671.48s -> 4680.63s]  steamed pork buns. It has to be. Wait, is it cutlets? Miso cutlets with pork buns.
[4680.63s -> 4690.52s]  Probably pork, right? Mustard? Pork and mustard. They go together really well. Did I just get a
[4690.52s -> 4703.00s]  Dan's game for saying pork and mustard? It's cutlets. Dude, it's no, it's not. It's another
[4703.00s -> 4716.44s]  no, no. Cutlets. It's literally cutlets. They go together great. Don't listen to chat. Yeah,
[4716.44s -> 4721.70s]  I know. What's going on here? Cutlets is the right answer. If you're wrong, I'm going to be pissed
[4721.70s -> 4729.58s]  off the rest of the stream. Bingo. So starting today, we'll be selling yummy miso cutlets.
[4732.09s -> 4749.70s]  Yay. Gabby J. Yay. Yay. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[4755.05s -> 4766.57s]  Where? What happened? Can't wait to try one. I really like them too. And the reward for guessing
[4766.57s -> 4783.50s]  correctly is our brand new miso cutlet lunch set. And it's only a two star. Gross. Yeah.
[4784.39s -> 4788.23s]  You give me too much credit. Besides, look at you. You become a model employee
[4788.23s -> 4794.39s]  and you're excellent at customer service as well. You think so? Well, I guess I'm not as nervous
[4794.39s -> 4800.71s]  around customers anymore. Not only that, but the head office likes your ideas too. Who knows,
[4800.71s -> 4807.46s]  you could be the manager of this store soon. Oh, no way. I have so much more to learn before
[4807.46s -> 4814.02s]  I can even start thinking about that. But if I am getting better at my job, I have to thank you for
[4814.02s -> 4823.38s]  that. How so? You were so scary looking. Hold on. You were so scary looking that I was terrified of
[4823.38s -> 4828.26s]  you at first, but we managed to become friends. Since then, I don't get jittery around other
[4828.26s -> 4844.33s]  people anymore. Oh, I'm pretty good at doing that shit. Only friends? Yeah, whatever. I'm not that
[4844.33s -> 4851.37s]  scary, am I? Well, hee hee heart face. And there it is. And there it is. And we got a heart. We
[4851.37s -> 4856.81s]  just got a heart. Okay. Just got one. I hope I can return the favor by making Poppo your favorite
[4856.81s -> 4884.01s]  store. Please keep shopping with us. Oh, hey, it's me again. I'm here to buy things to make you
[4884.01s -> 4898.89s]  happy. I can't carry it. I have a backpack and two duffel bags and grocery bags on both arms. And
[4898.89s -> 4909.45s]  I'm just stumbling in here. Hey, hey, I'll take like a couple of Slim Jims. Can you just put them
[4909.45s -> 4929.53s]  in my mouth? I'll open in my mouth. God damn it. All right, I'll be back. I've got to relieve
[4929.53s -> 4939.18s]  myself of stuff so I can go back and buy stuff to make that girl happy. Here, take this. Here,
[4939.18s -> 4948.73s]  take your beer. Oh, perfect. You're a decent guy for a kid your age. Kid one? How old am I?
[4949.37s -> 4964.52s]  How old is Kiryu? 20? He's 20 years old. Damn. All right, what did you want? No, not you.
[4969.64s -> 4980.94s]  What should I hand over? Here's the sweet potato soju. Enjoy it. How the fuck am I as old as Kiryu?
[4984.66s -> 4990.74s]  I don't know. You get the wrong attitude, kid. When an elder offers you a drink, you drink it.
[4990.74s -> 4993.70s]  Doesn't matter if you're a featherweight. That's the rules you want to get ahead.
[4994.58s -> 5004.46s]  Back when I was a businessman. Oh, whatever. You wanted the scotch, right? I'm really particular
[5004.46s -> 5009.74s]  about my whiskey. Oh, I didn't get scotch? That was just regular whiskey? Oh, shit.
[5011.70s -> 5018.44s]  You want... I'll have something else. Sake, right? All right, I don't have it. All right,
[5018.44s -> 5029.80s]  where can I get it? This is... Here's the drink place. Beef bowl restaurant. Bowl? Bowling?
[5029.80s -> 5038.50s]  Bowl? This is the person I'm going to talk to? Oppo? Don? There we go. Don Kyoto. All right,
[5038.50s -> 5058.34s]  we're going to be going right and then right. Oh, we got Yakuza. Did I say Kyoto? Kyoto?
[5061.30s -> 5080.17s]  Kyoto? Kiyotio? What do you say it? Kiyoti? Kiyoto? Kihote? Kiyotio? Kiyoto? Kiyoxio?
[5082.17s -> 5112.42s]  That's Spanish. What? What do you mean that's Spanish? Don Kyoto? It's not Spanish? Oh, it is.
[5113.53s -> 5122.66s]  Don Kiyote? Don Kyoto? The plot revolves around the adventures of a noble from
[5122.66s -> 5130.06s]  La Mancha named Alsano Kizano who reads so many chivalry romances that he loses his mind and
[5130.06s -> 5150.14s]  becomes a knight. Thanks literature. Okay, let's play the video game. Shut up. N.A. education. I
[5150.14s -> 5161.77s]  haven't been in a school desk in 20 fucking years. Give me a break. Give me the truck.
[5167.90s -> 5181.51s]  Beast mode. Beast mode. Can I pick up the truck in beast mode? Nice. You dropped out at 15.
[5191.29s -> 5200.58s]  No, I didn't. I'm just saying it's been a while. What's going on here? Oh shit. All these people
[5200.58s -> 5208.86s]  are waiting for smiles. Look, I'm just going to, I'm going to just walk by all these people
[5208.86s -> 5214.14s]  starting at the bottom with a huge toothy smile and just walk backwards looking at everybody
[5214.14s -> 5218.86s]  directly in their eyes and go, thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. All of you. Goodbye. Thank you.
[5219.74s -> 5223.42s]  And then get right in front of them, get in the right, get to the front of the fucking line.
[5235.75s -> 5238.87s]  I snuck off from work for this. If my manager finds out before I get back, I'm so dead.
[5243.86s -> 5251.61s]  Hey kid. Oh, yes. What's going on? Why are all these people here? Did you want one too?
[5252.41s -> 5258.66s]  I'm really sorry, but they said I'll get the last one in stock. What are you talking about?
[5259.30s -> 5266.63s]  Aren't you lining up for an Aura Q3? Aura Q3? Is that some kind of secret code?
[5267.83s -> 5277.51s]  No, it's an Aura Q3. The newest game in the Aura Cure series. Aura Q3 short for Aura Cure 3,
[5277.51s -> 5281.43s]  quest for the quantum quill. I can't wait to read the instruction manual on my way home.
[5283.11s -> 5288.23s]  Never heard of it. People are actually lining up to buy a video game. What an amazing world we live
[5288.23s -> 5293.50s]  in. Yeah, it's the most popular game in Japan right now. I went looking for it with Papa.
[5294.14s -> 5300.02s]  They were sold out everywhere. Then my friend told me this place was getting a new batch today.
[5300.02s -> 5303.62s]  So I grabbed my allowance and ran all the way here. They got any 3080s in there?
[5304.42s -> 5308.81s]  I made it just in time and got the last reservation ticket. I'm so happy. It's
[5308.81s -> 5315.77s]  going to be the best game ever made. Times are strange if it's this hard to buy a toy.
[5316.65s -> 5330.97s]  Sorry to bug you, kid. Thanks for the info. Bye, mister. I snuck off from work. Yeah,
[5330.97s -> 5337.34s]  we already talked to you. No cutting in line, pal. You have to play by the rules
[5337.34s -> 5347.75s]  and get in the back like everyone else. I'm so glad I lined up first thing this morning.
[5347.75s -> 5361.34s]  I'm going to be the first one to get it. I just went in. Wait, does this move not know
[5361.34s -> 5383.46s]  the store is open? I'll take a Aura Q3, please. Oh, damn it. I can't just buy one. Pires? Comfy
[5383.46s -> 5405.05s]  souls. Yeah, give me one of those. Okay. What else you got? Leather belt. Protective amulet.
[5406.41s -> 5420.17s]  Baseball shirt. Binding. Table, salt, coin, and gun. Okay. Gentleman's umbrella. Lumber.
[5421.05s -> 5424.33s]  Pocket tissues. Gold champagne. All right. Wait, did he want the good stuff?
[5425.29s -> 5440.89s]  Just we can just get the shitty stuff, right? Hold on. Oh, dude. Force drink, force stamp,
[5440.89s -> 5454.02s]  leather belt. Oh, dude. Force drink, force stamp, leather belt. Oh, dude. Force drink,
[5454.02s -> 5462.54s]  force stamp, leather belt. Okay. Just regular champagne, right? It's a really old meme. Yeah.
[5463.10s -> 5468.38s]  Sorry, I was on the internet like fucking 15 years ago. Got to be gold. That's too much money.
[5474.97s -> 5495.46s]  Zoomers don't get it. Oh, dude. Zoomers don't get it. Vintage. What else can I do here? Wait,
[5495.46s -> 5508.34s]  should I get the Mountain Dew? Oh, enjoying her nice Mountain Dew. Didn't we have a whole entire
[5508.34s -> 5514.74s]  stream where I got like the Mandela effect where like I said Tom Green did that and we couldn't
[5514.74s -> 5525.90s]  find it or something? Wait, 7-up? Why are these in the game? The actual brands? That's kind of weird.
[5526.70s -> 5541.83s]  Why are they just getting Mountain Dew? I'm just getting Mountain Dew. There's a ton of brands in
[5541.83s -> 5551.11s]  the Yakuza games. How do they do that without getting in trouble? All right. This is where I
[5551.11s -> 5557.35s]  go. Hey, do you guys sell cardboard boxes here? Yeah. Can I get like a couple of cardboard boxes,
[5557.35s -> 5562.58s]  like two or three cardboard boxes, just kind of like large squares? They're like, I guess. I mean,
[5562.58s -> 5568.26s]  that'll be like $3. Thank you. Thank you. And I buy the cardboard boxes and I just kind of get
[5568.26s -> 5574.14s]  them up from holding empty cardboard boxes. And I open the door to leave the store here and I go
[5574.70s -> 5593.26s]  like this. I start like out of running. Just run by the line. Hmm. Is that? Game over, loser.
[5594.14s -> 5604.30s]  What? Hey, the kid that was lining up for the game, right? Did you manage to get it? Oh, Mr.
[5605.10s -> 5614.12s]  What's the matter? It's my brand new video game. That guy stole it. What? You mean that high school
[5614.12s -> 5620.49s]  kid just stole it? Oh, he just ran up and yelled at me to hand it over. He took my
[5620.49s -> 5626.97s]  RQ3. I spent all morning waiting in line too. I saved up my allowance for a really, really long
[5626.97s -> 5633.29s]  time to get it. He stole from a kid. He deserved the strongest punishment. I'll get it. I'm going
[5633.29s -> 5639.78s]  to go get it. Here, kid. I'm going to go get that, but I can't promise that I won't smash it over his
[5639.78s -> 5644.31s]  head. I'm going to be in beast mode. It's going to be hard for me to control my emotions,
[5645.11s -> 5661.38s]  but I will get revenge for you. I promise. Hey kid, what's your name? It's it's Akio. Akio got it.
[5661.38s -> 5669.35s]  Hang tight. I'll get your game back. You will? So there's no need to cry. Mr. Okay. I won't cry
[5669.35s -> 5677.64s]  anymore. Good. That's showing some spine, little man. I like that. Leave it to me. Yay. Thank you,
[5677.64s -> 5686.70s]  mister. At high school. Oh, he's in high school. Oh, right. No, I'm not going to smash it over his
[5686.70s -> 5707.96s]  forget everything I just said. All right. Where is he? You get that back right now. Isn't that
[5709.58s -> 5712.78s]  later freak? Wait, did he just steal it from the high school kid?
[5717.46s -> 5726.15s]  They're just playing like steal the PlayStation five tag. No fair. That's the kid who took Akio's
[5726.15s -> 5736.02s]  game. Hey, you have that game. Don't you? What's it to you? My adventure just came to an abrupt end.
[5736.02s -> 5741.32s]  So leave me alone. Who can do I'll take back that our Akira you took from Akira.
[5743.06s -> 5746.74s]  RQ three. That's the last thing I want to hear about right now. Forget it. I'm going to grind
[5746.74s -> 5769.93s]  your ass just for the experience. What? Okay, I got a trash can in the head. Get the fuck over
[5769.93s -> 5785.05s]  here, dude. Put his head in the trash can. All this over a video game. What is that? Can this
[5785.05s -> 5800.18s]  kid in high school? What the hell am I doing? Mr. That run was I just caught the guy who took
[5800.18s -> 5810.42s]  your RQ. Oh, yay. Okay, give Akira his Akira back. Man, I don't have it. Give it up already.
[5810.42s -> 5814.10s]  If you don't want another beating handed over and get a job next time you want a video game.
[5814.74s -> 5818.46s]  I told you I don't have it. I got robbed by a better thief than me.
[5819.34s -> 5826.55s]  You were robbed who? Yeah, this jerk from a street gang busted out his dagger of stealing
[5826.55s -> 5833.43s]  and made me give it to him. Oh, a dagger for strength for stamp dagger of healing.
[5838.63s -> 5848.18s]  Dagger of stealing. I mean, yeah, lame. I could be leveling up but my our Q3 is probably going
[5848.18s -> 5857.53s]  to be some dude's not even a fan of the Q3. Dagger of healing. No, no, trust me. Trust me.
[5857.53s -> 5861.93s]  When I stab you with this dagger in the stomach, you're going to feel your diarrhea is going to
[5861.93s -> 5873.82s]  go away tomorrow morning. I promise. That wasn't yours. You rob a little kid and then turn around
[5873.82s -> 5880.22s]  and cry like a baby when you get mugged. How pathetic is that? You haven't learned your
[5880.22s -> 5887.46s]  lesson yet. You bunk. No, I'm already out of lives. Sorry, man. I'm out of here.
[5888.42s -> 5894.49s]  Didn't I just kick this guy's head into the wall as hard as I could? Being able to make like joky
[5894.49s -> 5899.77s]  video game references after all of your teeth are gone and you need like four hours of surgery to
[5899.77s -> 5903.77s]  fix your skull. Like, I mean, that's just I mean, come on. What's going on here?
[5910.06s -> 5918.89s]  All right, I'll get it back. The kid stole and stole it by some other stole somebody
[5918.89s -> 5936.17s]  and that guy went off this way. I swear to god if this guy gets robbed. Oh my god.
[5944.60s -> 5956.20s]  Oh my god. Okay. Hey, you're the guy that stole the PlayStation from the kid that stole it from
[5956.20s -> 5961.94s]  Accio. Who the hell is Accio and what if they did? I saw my chance and I took it. Yeah.
[5963.75s -> 5966.79s]  No, you robbed the kid who robbed Accio of his Arakura.
[5968.15s -> 5972.47s]  I don't get it. Forget it. Just give back the Arakura cartridge you stole.
[5974.01s -> 5990.95s]  Ara Q3, Ara Q3. I don't want to hear another word about Ara Q3. I'm gonna stomp you. Oh, nice.
[5991.67s -> 5993.59s]  Take him up by his legs and smash his head somewhere.
[5997.69s -> 6025.82s]  Fuck, I pressed the wrong button. Get up. Oh, I got a scratch on my arm.
[6026.30s -> 6035.29s]  There's a lady that walked on stage and she had like the arms that came in. She like did that
[6035.29s -> 6047.32s]  walk. It's a meme. The politician. Some EU politician. Theresa May. Yeah. All right.
[6047.32s -> 6062.36s]  He's doing like the Theresa May walk. All right. Give the Arakura. Sorry, pal, but your game got
[6062.36s -> 6070.15s]  pinched. I'm not playing around. Give the kid his game or you can suffer. Me. Suffer me now. I'm
[6070.15s -> 6075.59s]  serious. It's really gone. Some a-hole got the jump on me. You carry around a knife. You rob
[6076.39s -> 6081.64s]  kids and stuff and you stab people, but you won't say asshole, but you'll kill people.
[6082.28s -> 6091.03s]  Remember how we talked about earlier? You can gouge somebody's eyes out with a fucking stick.
[6091.75s -> 6096.12s]  But like saying the word fuck on TV, we're seeing it's coming full circle.
[6103.80s -> 6112.22s]  Professionals have standards. Remember your nephews are watching. My nephews are not watching
[6112.22s -> 6125.03s]  Yakuza. This hard ass held me up at gunpoint. That guy that was just here. What a shitty day.
[6125.59s -> 6131.78s]  That guy jacked my Ara Q3. That wasn't yours. You steal from a kid then cry like a baby when
[6131.78s -> 6135.22s]  you get mugged. I'm seeing a pathetic pattern here. If this isn't getting through to you,
[6135.22s -> 6147.69s]  how about we go another round? No. No. If I'm good, I'm sorry. My Ara Q3. Don't worry. I promise I'll
[6147.69s -> 6156.54s]  hunt it down. At this point, at this point, I'm going to be like, son, just give me one second.
[6156.54s -> 6165.96s]  Do you ever heard of eBay? Here, I'll get one for you. What's your address? Well, the thug who took
[6165.96s -> 6169.56s]  Akio's Ara Q3 from the kid who stole it in the first place ended up having it taken by some
[6169.56s -> 6190.46s]  hard ass Yakuza who went up towards the Taihei Boulevard. Let's go. It's 1988. Oh, internet
[6190.46s -> 6196.90s]  didn't exist. Well, I would just go buy one. I would just, okay, here's what I would do. Yeah,
[6196.90s -> 6202.90s]  sure. eBay didn't exist. I would stand on the corner, like right here, wherever that game store
[6202.90s -> 6207.38s]  was. And I would just go, ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for one moment?
[6208.95s -> 6217.51s]  If anyone has recently purchased the Ara Q3 system, I am willing to pay 20% more than what
[6217.51s -> 6225.53s]  you paid for it. I currently have $500 cash in my pocket, and I'll do it. We will do a transaction
[6225.61s -> 6232.58s]  right now. Spread the word. I'll be here every afternoon from 2pm to 4pm Pacific.
[6233.30s -> 6239.86s]  And I would just go, I never wait till somebody showed up. You get robbed. Oh, yeah. What about
[6239.86s -> 6253.30s]  that one? Yeah. Yeah. You're gonna come rob me? Oh, excuse me. Where is it going? Sold out. Yeah,
[6253.30s -> 6260.10s]  that's why I'd be announcing it on the corner. If you're more comfortable with getting a check,
[6260.10s -> 6269.21s]  I have those too. You're finally mine Ara Q3. My quest is complete. A game you got there.
[6271.46s -> 6281.85s]  You stole it. Oh, you see this Ara Cura belongs to us. Bwa ha ha. So if you want to live, get off my
[6281.85s -> 6287.75s]  street. Listen, don't bother looking for a place that's still selling Ara Q3. Just find a fool who
[6287.75s -> 6298.07s]  bought one and take it. Villains. Every last one. What's this world coming to? Bah. What'd you say,
[6298.07s -> 6305.27s]  boy? That Ara Cura, you're, I'm taking it from you. What's that? Take it back. So listen up, boy.
[6306.23s -> 6312.18s]  Pornography starring your mother. Don't act like it was your game to start with. Huh? Shut up,
[6312.18s -> 6319.10s]  it's complicated. I see you're an Ara Q3 hunter too then. Playtime is over. I'm not holding back.
[6319.10s -> 6325.83s]  And he has a gun. He just aims it up, excuse me, right in the forehead. Can he kill me?
[6326.63s -> 6358.94s]  Don't even let him shoot it. Why is he hitting me? You have a gun. He's using it as a melee weapon.
[6359.82s -> 6370.31s]  This cannot be. I'll be taking that Ara Q3 with me. Hold on, please. I need that. Give it back. Come
[6370.31s -> 6376.01s]  on. Give it back? This was never yours to begin with. Bella, I'm begging you, please. My little
[6376.01s -> 6382.71s]  boy's been really looking forward to playing it. Your son? Uh, yeah. My old lady left me and took
[6382.71s -> 6389.38s]  the boy with her. He's been wanting Ara Q3. Wait a minute, is this the, is the kid's dad?
[6389.54s -> 6397.62s]  We were looking everywhere, but there ain't none for sale anywhere. I just wanted my boy to be
[6397.62s -> 6404.14s]  happy. I'm begging you. You gotta let me have it, please. Uh, I can't do that. You probably don't
[6404.14s -> 6407.66s]  know this, but a little kid saved up his allowance and went through a lot of trouble to buy the last
[6407.66s -> 6415.03s]  one. Huh? I didn't stick up a little kid. I just took it off some worthless goon. That's right,
[6415.03s -> 6419.93s]  you got the game from a punk, but that game belonged to a little kid first. Long story short,
[6420.73s -> 6426.33s]  you took Ara Q3 from a wannabe punk who took it from a high school bully who took it from the last
[6426.33s -> 6431.82s]  boy in line who bought it in the first place. And head hurts just thinking about it, but all right,
[6431.82s -> 6436.47s]  so that's what happened. And I came to get it back for the little kid. It's gonna, going back to the
[6436.47s -> 6445.61s]  rightful owner. I'm sorry. It's gonna be the kid's dad. Bella, I'm the fool here. Give it back to that
[6445.61s -> 6452.95s]  kid for me. Damn, I was about to make someone's kid cry for the sake of my own. What kind of monster
[6452.95s -> 6458.63s]  have I become? I thought I could make my boy happy with something I stole from someone else.
[6458.63s -> 6467.77s]  I was wrong. Am I supposed to be a good dad to my boy? Do Akio like this? Yeah. I guess you better
[6467.77s -> 6476.92s]  think about it. Wait, what? Who? Oh, hi, mister. Perfect timing, Akio. I got your Ara Q3 back.
[6477.82s -> 6485.45s]  Oh, really? Yippee. Oh, Akio, it's you. Oh, my boy. Oh, hi, papa.
[6486.41s -> 6493.02s]  Papa? You guys are related? That's right. Are you friends with papa, mister?
[6494.20s -> 6503.35s]  Uh, yeah, you might say that. Simpson's episode. Wait, buddy, that little kid you were telling me
[6503.35s -> 6517.10s]  about, that was his. Yeah, that seems to be how this is shaking up. Why, Akio? Why didn't you say
[6517.10s -> 6522.28s]  anything to your papa? All you had to do was ask. I could have given you the money to buy Ara Q3
[6522.36s -> 6529.42s]  any time you smashed his dad's brain into the pavement in front of him. Hey,
[6529.42s -> 6537.72s]  Jerma sucks. Thanks for the 10 community subs. I beg to differ because mama always gets mad at
[6537.72s -> 6544.46s]  you, papa, for spending money on golfing and go-karts and board games. And I didn't want
[6544.46s -> 6548.78s]  mama to get mad at you even more for spending all your money again, papa. So I tried to buy it myself.
[6550.57s -> 6556.18s]  Akio, I just like did a huge burp. I'm sorry. Did you guys hear that? I hope you didn't.
[6556.82s -> 6562.66s]  That just hurt. It came out of my nostrils. I just leaned back and went,
[6563.70s -> 6569.94s]  and it came out of my eyes. It went through my sinuses. That hurt. I'm sorry. Mr. Papa looks
[6569.94s -> 6577.85s]  kind of scary, but he's a really, really nice man once you get to know him. Ew. Don't share that. I
[6577.85s -> 6586.30s]  share everything. He took me to a bunch of game stores just the other day. He's not living with
[6586.30s -> 6593.96s]  mama and me now. I think he's lonely. Please stay friends with him, okay? Actually, Akio,
[6593.96s -> 6601.99s]  your papa helped me get your RQ3 back. Yeah, that's right. He did. And his dad smiles,
[6601.99s -> 6606.23s]  a big smile, which just bruises all over his face and like four of his teeth fall out and like
[6606.23s -> 6621.00s]  bloods all over his mouth. Really? Thank you, papa. I did in a way. I don't want to see you crying
[6621.00s -> 6631.45s]  again. Nice Looney Tunes joke. Yeah. I think that actually happens like every three episodes.
[6635.69s -> 6640.73s]  How many times has Davy Duck's teeth fallen out of his mouth after getting like smashed in the head
[6640.73s -> 6648.31s]  with a board? I don't want to see you crying. Be careful going home with your game. Yep. Got it.
[6648.31s -> 6660.65s]  Thank you, mister. Hey, mister. Thanks. This is to apologize or to thank you for teaching this fool a
[6660.65s -> 6676.10s]  lesson. Maybe whatever. I want you to have it. Got a sunburst. Holy shit. What was that? Is that a
[6676.10s -> 6682.33s]  katana? A sword? I now want to be a good dad all the time, not just in front of Akio.
[6682.89s -> 6685.77s]  You don't want to do anything that'll make kids sad, no matter whose kids they are.
[6687.10s -> 6693.27s]  Yeah, you got that right. Papa, this is too hard for me all by myself. Let's go to mama's house
[6693.27s -> 6707.62s]  and play RQ3 to go. Oh, my heart is exploding. Oh, without the expert advice, without my expert
[6707.62s -> 6714.12s]  advice, we'll be making a beeline to that nasty demon lord in no time. That's how a game should
[6714.12s -> 6731.86s]  be played. There it is. That was very, I loved that. That was wonderful. That was wonderful.
[6738.63s -> 6743.03s]  I got a sword out of it, too. All right. What was I doing? Oh, yeah. I need to give shampoo.
[6743.03s -> 6759.46s]  Do I, where do I get the champagne? I have, uh, what did I get? Did I get a golden champagne?
[6759.46s -> 6788.07s]  Where is it? You didn't buy it. What? I didn't buy it? Really? I thought I bought it. Oh, come on.
[6788.07s -> 6790.87s]  Really? All right. Well, I did that quest. That was cool. So let's be going to go straight and
[6790.87s -> 6796.62s]  then go right and then right. Sorry. I don't want to be like a coughing Andy.
[6820.07s -> 6823.27s]  Yeah, I want to make sure I said this again. For those of you that don't, I'm sick. I'm a little
[6823.27s -> 6829.58s]  sick. Just trying to stream around being sick. I was tested for COVID. I'm negative for COVID.
[6829.58s -> 6832.70s]  So I just want to make that clear. For those of you that might be concerned,
[6833.66s -> 6842.42s]  I haven't tested. I'm negative. Uh, where is this place? It's right here, right? Wrong side.
[6843.30s -> 6860.22s]  Wrong side. Wrong side. Wrong side. Wrong side. Okay. Give me something, please.
[6860.38s -> 6881.56s]  Okay. I have. So do I actually have to buy the gold one?
[6882.20s -> 6892.02s]  Dear Jerma, sorry for being, what? How's this coffee cost? Hold on. Dear Jerma, sorry for
[6892.02s -> 6895.62s]  being off topic, but upon reviewing a recent VOD, I noticed a peculiar claim you made.
[6896.26s -> 6900.74s]  You claim that you rubbed your body wash on your chest to build up a good lather, which you could
[6900.74s -> 6905.62s]  then use on other parts of the body. The ability to build lather is determined by surface area,
[6905.62s -> 6910.34s]  meaning you must have significant surface area already on your chest. The only explanation for
[6910.34s -> 6921.34s]  the, this would be a large amount of chest hair. Um, no, that's not accurate. I don't have like a
[6921.34s -> 6933.14s]  lot of chest hair. No, I don't have a lot of chest hair. I really don't. I have, they kind of sprout
[6933.14s -> 6938.33s]  up a little bit and I just go and I just pull them with like a pair of tweezers. Cause nobody
[6938.33s -> 6944.58s]  wants to have like eight chest hairs, right? Like, no, get rid of them. I have like 12, eight to
[6944.58s -> 6951.77s]  12 chest hairs and I just kind of look in the mirror and I go and just pull them. My eyebrows,
[6951.77s -> 6958.68s]  I do, well, I pluck my eyebrows. I pluck my chest hairs. I clean up, right? I do some little,
[6958.68s -> 6969.24s]  I clean up. I make sure I'm, you know, look, make sure I look okay. Yeah, I, sorry. I, oh, sorry.
[6969.24s -> 6980.60s]  I take care of, I take care of my hair. I don't want it to go out of control. You know, you do
[6980.60s -> 6983.24s]  everything. Sometimes I let it go for a little while and you get, you know, you clean it up.
[6983.24s -> 6997.03s]  You know, I don't want to have like the, I have this wild hair, wild everywhere. Next topic. Oh,
[6997.03s -> 7002.55s]  I don't mind. I sometimes, I mean, you gotta clean up a little. You're like Patrick Bateman.
[7003.77s -> 7018.06s]  I'm not like Patrick Bateman. All right. Do you have the other thing too? Cause I like pluck my
[7018.06s -> 7026.28s]  eyebrows. I like get my eyebrows done. Cause I, I, I, I get like my hands and feet done too.
[7027.16s -> 7032.04s]  Is that, you don't, we think that's weird too. You don't, you think that's odd. Get over it.
[7045.46s -> 7052.49s]  I can't buy anything else from her. Yeah. That's self care. Oh yeah. It's yeah. Come on. Good
[7052.49s -> 7060.02s]  boy. That's hey. I thought, yeah, of course. I'm just doing a little, you do a little, you know,
[7060.02s -> 7073.24s]  TLC. Uh, okay. I'm going to give the champagne to the guy. THC.
[7076.55s -> 7088.36s]  Chest hair is gross. I don't have chest hair. Didn't I just sprint? Why is it? Oh, okay. I
[7088.36s -> 7092.81s]  pluck my nose here. Yeah. I got to take care of those too. But be careful. Be careful. I'm
[7092.81s -> 7096.25s]  going to give you guys some tips here. If you're going to take care of your nose hairs,
[7096.97s -> 7101.45s]  just, just trim them down to like the edge of where your, your nostrils are.
[7102.01s -> 7104.73s]  Cause you can end up with a problem. I've had this happen before. This is not a joke.
[7105.37s -> 7110.81s]  If you do, if you go too far in and you trim too much, you can actually get an ingrown hair
[7110.81s -> 7118.81s]  in your nose. And, and I've had, this has happened to me twice. I have trimmed my nose hairs to a
[7118.81s -> 7124.97s]  point where I got an ingrown in my nose and this shit came out the other side of my nose.
[7126.01s -> 7133.77s]  It was so painful. I had an ingrown inside of my nose and it grew. It went out the front of my
[7133.77s -> 7139.61s]  nose and I had to pull it out. It was horrible. It was horrible. Please, please. If you're going
[7139.61s -> 7144.89s]  to trim your nose hairs, do it just to the edge of where your nose hairs are about to touch your

[8310.22s -> 8312.81s]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[8312.81s -> 8314.85s]  I'm sorry, I'm looking like sniffily.
[8314.85s -> 8315.89s]  I know people hate that shit
[8315.89s -> 8318.29s]  and I know I'm like streaming sick and I'm sorry
[8318.29s -> 8320.85s]  and I'll talk, I'll take tomorrow off, I promise.
[8333.72s -> 8337.68s]  I heard you've worked at the Chibana real estate company.
[8337.68s -> 8338.52s]  Ugh.
[8338.52s -> 8341.36s]  Yeah, I've been sitting in the same place all day.
[8341.36s -> 8342.60s]  Don't you fucking dare.
[8342.60s -> 8346.00s]  I'm just a simple part-time job.
[8346.00s -> 8347.16s]  I need a doctor's note.
[8347.16s -> 8350.84s]  I just got my first check and I got a second one.
[8350.84s -> 8353.60s]  I'm gonna sit in a different place tomorrow.
[8354.68s -> 8359.13s]  You've been doing this all this time, right?
[8359.13s -> 8360.29s]  I've seen it too, so I know.
[8360.29s -> 8361.25s]  I'm going to the doctor's office.
[8361.25s -> 8362.57s]  Yeah, I need a doctor's note.
[8362.57s -> 8363.41s]  You know that?
[8363.45s -> 8365.09s]  You need a doctor's note for work?
[8365.09s -> 8367.73s]  Um, I mean, kinda.
[8367.73s -> 8368.73s]  Should I call it that?
[8370.13s -> 8371.97s]  What are you talking about?
[8371.97s -> 8374.17s]  Oh, I make like jokey pretend sex tips
[8374.17s -> 8376.33s]  to like a bunch of people on the internet.
[8376.33s -> 8378.53s]  And then I play a video game in the background.
[8382.29s -> 8383.85s]  Sure, I guess that could be work.
[8387.89s -> 8389.21s]  Pretend, pretend?
[8389.21s -> 8391.25s]  Oh, that was real?
[8391.25s -> 8392.21s]  I just can tell the doctor that
[8392.21s -> 8394.01s]  so he doesn't think I'm weird, right?
[8398.47s -> 8399.31s]  And he leans in and goes,
[8399.31s -> 8401.83s]  by the way, you're talking about sex tips.
[8401.83s -> 8402.67s]  What are they?
[8404.43s -> 8406.91s]  I gotta spice things up with me and my life.
[8406.91s -> 8408.75s]  What would you suggest?
[8410.38s -> 8413.26s]  Oh, that's Champion Street, right?
[8413.26s -> 8416.26s]  I see you're doing well.
[8416.26s -> 8419.86s]  That area is now the mecca of self-reliance.
[8419.86s -> 8421.70s]  It's just a small bar.
[8421.70s -> 8422.54s]  Bro.
[8425.34s -> 8427.98s]  And the camera pans back, coming out of the office,
[8427.98s -> 8431.58s]  and I'm like, hey, you ever seen Scooby-Doo?
[8431.58s -> 8432.94s]  And then they are like the clapping,
[8432.94s -> 8434.78s]  the studio audience is clapping and laughing,
[8434.78s -> 8436.66s]  and then we fade out to the credits.
[8436.66s -> 8439.54s]  That area is not only for the Tachibana people,
[8439.54s -> 8443.16s]  but also for the people of the Tojo Clan.
[8443.16s -> 8445.72s]  If a yakuza like you goes there,
[8445.72s -> 8449.84s]  the people there will hate you.
[8449.84s -> 8451.00s]  I see.
[8451.00s -> 8452.88s]  That's helpful.
[8452.88s -> 8453.92s]  Thank you.
[8453.92s -> 8455.24s]  Made by Dick Wolf.
[8457.45s -> 8458.77s]  The Champion District.
[8458.77s -> 8464.62s]  That may be my ticket to bumping into Tachibana's boys again.
[8464.62s -> 8465.46s]  It's the tweet.
[8465.46s -> 8466.28s]  All I need is the tweet.
[8466.28s -> 8467.12s]  I don't care about anything else.
[8467.12s -> 8467.96s]  I got the tweet.
[8467.96s -> 8468.78s]  I got the lore tweet.
[8468.98s -> 8470.89s]  Ooh, hold on.
[8470.89s -> 8471.73s]  Is that you, boy?
[8471.73s -> 8475.04s]  Isn't it over here?
[8475.04s -> 8477.48s]  Oh, it's Glockus.
[8477.48s -> 8478.76s]  Perfect timing.
[8478.76s -> 8480.72s]  There's something I need to talk to you about.
[8480.72s -> 8482.16s]  I'll wait for you back here.
[8487.09s -> 8493.61s]  Do I care about what he has to say right now?
[8493.61s -> 8496.49s]  Look, I heard you're giving out sex tips.
[8496.49s -> 8498.57s]  We're in an alley, nobody can hear us.
[8498.57s -> 8503.92s]  Give me a good one.
[8503.92s -> 8505.20s]  We're the only way somewhere, boy.
[8505.20s -> 8508.83s]  Sorry to hold you up.
[8508.83s -> 8510.67s]  Yeah, you wanna talk?
[8510.67s -> 8512.07s]  That's right, tell me.
[8512.07s -> 8514.14s]  Have you been training?
[8514.14s -> 8516.10s]  Yeah, here and there.
[8516.90s -> 8519.90s]  Good, because I have something I'd like to ask you to do.
[8519.90s -> 8522.46s]  If you're willing, that is.
[8522.46s -> 8524.34s]  What's with the hesitation?
[8524.34s -> 8526.32s]  That's not like you.
[8526.32s -> 8528.92s]  Truth is, I've got debt collectors on me tail.
[8528.92s -> 8531.32s]  Scary ones.
[8531.32s -> 8534.20s]  Yeah, I gather you've been running since we met.
[8534.20s -> 8537.12s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8537.12s -> 8541.12s]  Those two-bit jokers are nickel and dime stuff.
[8541.12s -> 8542.64s]  I'm talking tunas.
[8542.64s -> 8545.96s]  Famous, and I mean that in the global sense.
[8545.96s -> 8547.68s]  And now they're here in Japan.
[8547.68s -> 8550.08s]  Hot on my tail.
[8550.08s -> 8552.38s]  Blond, did you seriously try to escape
[8552.38s -> 8555.92s]  your mountain of debt by fleeing to Japan?
[8555.92s -> 8559.64s]  Yes, and this time, they may be no going back.
[8559.64s -> 8562.70s]  I think there's a price on my head.
[8562.70s -> 8566.02s]  I guess it's too late to pay the money back then.
[8566.02s -> 8569.17s]  What are you going to do, Bacchus?
[8569.17s -> 8572.99s]  Well, I was hoping I could get you to be my bodyguard.
[8572.99s -> 8574.59s]  Figured as much.
[8574.59s -> 8579.65s]  Unfortunately, I've already got enough trouble on my plate.
[8579.65s -> 8581.37s]  Believe me, you'd probably be in a worse danger
[8581.37s -> 8583.51s]  with me around anyways.
[8583.55s -> 8588.02s]  Oh, no, that's in no way to have a part, please.
[8588.02s -> 8590.46s]  Sure, I can't pay retainer, but if you protect me,
[8590.46s -> 8593.18s]  I'll teach you some of my top shelf moves.
[8593.18s -> 8594.89s]  They're good stuff.
[8594.89s -> 8596.17s]  Ooh, wait, what?
[8596.17s -> 8597.85s]  We're going to get tips?
[8597.85s -> 8599.09s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on,
[8599.09s -> 8600.93s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, you're going to flip this on me?
[8600.93s -> 8605.12s]  I got, are these moves better than my moves?
[8605.12s -> 8606.68s]  Damn straight, they are.
[8606.68s -> 8609.65s]  That'll do you right in a tight fight, me boy.
[8609.65s -> 8611.62s]  Oh, okay.
[8611.62s -> 8614.08s]  Are you Bacchus?
[8621.86s -> 8624.46s]  I think they found me, boy.
[8624.46s -> 8628.03s]  This is the big scary debt collector, huh?
[8628.03s -> 8629.57s]  I'm here for your head.
[8629.57s -> 8631.09s]  Just doing my job.
[8631.09s -> 8632.73s]  So don't hold it against me.
[8632.73s -> 8633.94s]  Nanny?
[8633.94s -> 8635.10s]  Debt collector, huh?
[8635.10s -> 8638.03s]  More like Hitman.
[8638.03s -> 8640.13s]  Oh, you're looking forward to that one too.
[8640.13s -> 8644.17s]  Did you hear that the PSVR is the only version it'll be on?
[8644.17s -> 8647.94s]  And it's only going to be on the PS4 version of Hitman 3?
[8647.94s -> 8650.10s]  That immediately deduces a full retrograde
[8650.10s -> 8651.90s]  from that fucking game.
[8651.90s -> 8653.14s]  I can't believe it either.
[8653.14s -> 8656.36s]  It's a stupid decision.
[8656.44s -> 8665.04s]  Please help me.
[8665.04s -> 8666.72s]  I guess I don't have much of a choice if I left you here.
[8666.72s -> 8668.84s]  I'd be putting a bullet in your head myself.
[8668.84s -> 8672.28s]  Stand back, get out of here.
[8672.28s -> 8673.40s]  No, settle down.
[8673.40s -> 8675.52s]  All right, actually delete that one.
[8675.52s -> 8676.76s]  Delete that one.
[8676.76s -> 8678.26s]  For real, delete it.
[8678.26s -> 8679.64s]  Delete it.
[8679.64s -> 8683.00s]  You're protecting this guy?
[8683.00s -> 8687.83s]  For now, I don't especially feel like watching him die.
[8687.83s -> 8689.15s]  I see, fine.
[8689.15s -> 8692.47s]  There may be not a price on your head,
[8692.47s -> 8695.63s]  but I'll see if I can swing a bonus afterwards.
[8695.63s -> 8697.83s]  Crack knuckle, crack knuckle, crack knuckle, crack knuckle,
[8698.43s -> 8699.61s]  crack knuckle, crack crack.
[8699.61s -> 8701.90s]  Here we go.
[8701.90s -> 8707.50s]  Way ahead of you, old man.
[8707.50s -> 8712.44s]  Mysterious Hitman.
[8712.44s -> 8715.89s]  Come on.
[8715.89s -> 8719.63s]  Oh, that's all it takes.
[8720.71s -> 8722.51s]  You just have to shoot you for real.
[8726.85s -> 8728.49s]  Don't shoot me with that.
[8728.49s -> 8729.85s]  Get off me.
[8729.85s -> 8730.69s]  Oh.
[8738.42s -> 8740.62s]  Give me this.
[8740.62s -> 8741.46s]  Oh shit.
[8749.42s -> 8757.03s]  Get off.
[8757.03s -> 8757.87s]  What's that, nails?
[8757.87s -> 8768.17s]  Wait.
[8768.61s -> 8779.85s]  Use the sword.
[8779.85s -> 8781.62s]  Gah.
[8781.62s -> 8783.52s]  I'm letting you live.
[8783.52s -> 8786.44s]  You go back and tell whoever ordered the hit
[8786.44s -> 8789.28s]  to forget about Bacchus.
[8789.28s -> 8790.12s]  You hear me?
[8803.03s -> 8804.43s]  There'll be others on this trail soon enough.
[8804.43s -> 8806.58s]  They'll get what's coming to him.
[8806.58s -> 8809.39s]  This is the worst Yakuza dub.
[8809.39s -> 8810.63s]  You think so?
[8810.63s -> 8812.15s]  All right, that's a one guy moment.
[8812.15s -> 8814.55s]  I'm fucking gonna actually try really hard here.
[8817.02s -> 8818.94s]  There'll be others on this trail soon enough.
[8818.94s -> 8821.28s]  You'll get what's coming to him.
[8823.04s -> 8824.96s]  Hold on, you stay right fucking there.
[8824.96s -> 8825.80s]  Don't leave the stream.
[8825.80s -> 8829.32s]  I saw your name.
[8829.32s -> 8831.23s]  Sorry, boy.
[8831.23s -> 8833.16s]  Why the apology?
[8833.16s -> 8835.24s]  I told you to watch out for a knife in your ribs.
[8835.24s -> 8836.36s]  Hey, you, hold on.
[8836.36s -> 8837.70s]  Now you're in my head.
[8839.66s -> 8840.90s]  I told you.
[8840.90s -> 8843.34s]  I told you to watch out for a knife in your ribs.
[8843.34s -> 8846.80s]  And here I am putting you in danger myself.
[8846.80s -> 8848.30s]  Don't worry about that.
[8848.30s -> 8851.30s]  I'd rather hear more about the offer you made earlier.
[8851.30s -> 8852.14s]  This is bad.
[8854.86s -> 8856.38s]  You said you'd teach me some new moves.
[8856.38s -> 8857.66s]  Better make it quick though
[8857.66s -> 8859.26s]  before the next Hitman gets here.
[8862.43s -> 8863.67s]  You sure about this, boy?
[8865.87s -> 8867.19s]  I don't have much of a choice.
[8867.19s -> 8868.91s]  Like that person's in my head now.
[8868.91s -> 8871.19s]  I can just see this is the worst dub ever.
[8871.19s -> 8873.03s]  It's just flashing in front of my head.
[8875.02s -> 8876.62s]  I don't have much choice.
[8876.62s -> 8879.54s]  Like I said, I've got my own problems.
[8879.54s -> 8882.02s]  So a few extra survival skills would come in handy.
[8884.74s -> 8887.22s]  All right, then let me fill you in on some moves
[8887.22s -> 8889.38s]  that'll send those Hitman reeling.
[8896.26s -> 8898.74s]  Hey, boy.
[8898.74s -> 8905.24s]  You ready to learn my moves?
[8905.24s -> 8909.22s]  These are the moves I can teach you, boy.
[8909.22s -> 8911.86s]  What's the, yeah, what's the key to brawling?
[8911.86s -> 8912.78s]  Yes.
[8912.78s -> 8914.18s]  Yes.
[8914.18s -> 8915.38s]  Yes.
[8915.38s -> 8916.50s]  Okay.
[8916.50s -> 8919.10s]  The most important thing in a fight is tenacity.
[8919.10s -> 8920.06s]  That's the secret.
[8920.98s -> 8923.02s]  Sounds pretty simple for a secret.
[8923.02s -> 8925.94s]  Though I guess in a fight, simplicity is best.
[8925.94s -> 8928.50s]  Brawling comes down to spirit in the end.
[8928.50s -> 8932.40s]  So I'm going to teach you a move that harnesses that power.
[8932.40s -> 8935.82s]  I call it spirit fire.
[8935.82s -> 8938.13s]  Spirit fire?
[8938.13s -> 8939.55s]  Interesting.
[8939.55s -> 8941.27s]  So you use the force of an enemy's blow
[8941.27s -> 8943.63s]  to strike them back with twice the power?
[8943.63s -> 8944.63s]  Yes.
[8944.63s -> 8946.11s]  Yes.
[8946.11s -> 8950.78s]  I'm sure you'll be able to make use of it.
[8950.78s -> 8955.70s]  Hey, you're Bacchus, right?
[8955.70s -> 8957.54s]  Oh, another guy.
[8957.54s -> 8961.44s]  It's one of those Japanese hooligans.
[8961.44s -> 8963.36s]  You call yourself an assassin?
[8963.36s -> 8966.86s]  You look about as pro as some sorry street punk.
[8966.86s -> 8969.06s]  I don't really know what's going on here,
[8969.06s -> 8970.82s]  but I just got paid a fortune up front
[8970.82s -> 8973.98s]  by some guy in chat, a one guy.
[8973.98s -> 8977.20s]  I get the rest once the job's done.
[8977.20s -> 8981.02s]  Oh, so he's a street fighter on a freelance job.
[8981.02s -> 8983.61s]  He doesn't look so tough.
[8983.61s -> 8984.69s]  Shut it.
[8984.69s -> 8987.37s]  I may not look like much, but I've never lost a fight.
[8987.37s -> 8989.29s]  Time to earn this cash.
[8989.29s -> 8991.77s]  Please don't smash my head over and over again into the wall.
[8991.77s -> 8993.21s]  Please don't use a bike on me
[8993.21s -> 8995.85s]  and smash the bike over my head and get a million dollars.
[8995.85s -> 8997.33s]  Don't kick me in the head while I'm on the ground
[8997.33s -> 8998.83s]  and crush my head.
[8998.83s -> 9003.27s]  Let's go, you fucking loser.
[9003.27s -> 9004.59s]  I think you've got the tenacity to win.
[9004.59s -> 9007.81s]  This is the perfect chance, boy.
[9007.81s -> 9008.85s]  Yeah.
[9008.85s -> 9011.74s]  Time to try out that move I just learned.
[9011.74s -> 9012.58s]  What?
[9014.46s -> 9015.90s]  You want some first, do you?
[9015.90s -> 9028.14s]  All right, open up, sir, I'll serve you your tea.
[9028.14s -> 9033.83s]  Oops, I just skipped it.
[9033.83s -> 9037.30s]  Holy shit, what, I have a gun too?
[9037.30s -> 9041.61s]  Wait, what, I have a weapon?
[9041.61s -> 9042.93s]  You can charge up a counterattack.
[9042.93s -> 9046.32s]  The attack's more powerful and likely to knock the opponent.
[9046.32s -> 9047.40s]  Start.
[9047.48s -> 9048.72s]  Start.
[9048.72s -> 9050.84s]  Hold down X or Y after being attacked.
[9067.06s -> 9068.14s]  Okay.
[9068.14s -> 9070.66s]  Defeat the Hitman, targeting Bacchus.
[9070.66s -> 9077.56s]  Use your brawler style of moves to take out the assassin.
[9077.56s -> 9081.22s]  What, I'm trying to counterattack.
[9081.22s -> 9095.15s]  I want to do the thing that just toppled.
[9095.15s -> 9095.99s]  You want to do that?
[9095.99s -> 9104.66s]  Throw him into the trash.
[9104.66s -> 9111.34s]  Oh, just, can I just shoot him?
[9119.93s -> 9120.77s]  Oh, dog, dog, dog.
[9129.36s -> 9130.68s]  Right face.
[9130.68s -> 9132.04s]  Yeah, all right, let's go.
[9136.47s -> 9139.74s]  Should have saved up, that was a mistake.
[9139.74s -> 9141.18s]  Holy shit, that dodge though.
[9143.12s -> 9144.76s]  I'm gonna die, wait.
[9144.76s -> 9152.06s]  Step on his head.
[9152.06s -> 9153.46s]  Run, run, run, run, kick.
[9157.52s -> 9158.60s]  Tried to grab me, didn't you?
[9158.60s -> 9164.80s]  Nope.
[9164.80s -> 9165.64s]  Over here.
[9176.70s -> 9180.64s]  I might have no more drink.
[9180.64s -> 9184.46s]  Happy holidays, happy holidays to you too.
[9184.46s -> 9185.99s]  Boy wins.
[9185.99s -> 9186.95s]  Hey.
[9186.95s -> 9187.87s]  Yeah?
[9187.87s -> 9189.59s]  What?
[9189.59s -> 9192.75s]  What did the guy that paid you look like?
[9192.75s -> 9194.35s]  It was dark, I didn't get a good look at their face.
[9194.35s -> 9195.99s]  From the way they talked, I guess they were foreign.
[9197.26s -> 9198.58s]  Was it me?
[9198.58s -> 9199.70s]  Of course not, yeah, it was him.
[9199.70s -> 9204.40s]  It was, oh, did you guys hear that?
[9204.40s -> 9209.05s]  There was like a person talking out of my throat.
[9209.05s -> 9210.41s]  It was like, no, it wasn't.
[9210.41s -> 9211.65s]  Nope.
[9211.65s -> 9213.46s]  Did anybody hear that?
[9213.46s -> 9216.65s]  Maybe my noise gate didn't pick it up.
[9216.65s -> 9217.81s]  I went, oh, blah, blah, blah.
[9217.81s -> 9219.76s]  Nope.
[9219.76s -> 9222.20s]  Oh, I hope it got picked up, it was weird.
[9222.20s -> 9230.07s]  I was about to cough.
[9230.07s -> 9238.89s]  You stop getting CBD injections.
[9238.89s -> 9240.29s]  It was Jerma's tapeworm.
[9241.48s -> 9242.32s]  Oh.
[9242.32s -> 9244.00s]  Jerma, is chat your little pogchamp?
[9245.94s -> 9251.50s]  Yeah, I don't know, sure.
[9251.50s -> 9255.19s]  Looks like you handled this one no problem.
[9255.19s -> 9260.66s]  We better hope they're all like this.
[9260.66s -> 9265.75s]  All right, I'm injured, I need to drink.
[9265.75s -> 9271.77s]  I need to drink.
[9271.77s -> 9275.70s]  Okay, I feel better.
[9275.70s -> 9280.35s]  Four million, was that four million off the debt if I...
[9280.35s -> 9282.59s]  Four million off the debt to improv an apology video
[9282.59s -> 9285.87s]  for showing your genitals on stream.
[9285.87s -> 9287.15s]  No, that's not enough.
[9307.30s -> 9309.62s]  Okay, let me do the story mission.
[9309.62s -> 9311.02s]  I've been playing for like three hours
[9311.02s -> 9312.50s]  and I don't think I've done anything.
[9322.82s -> 9323.66s]  These people are chasing me.
[9323.66s -> 9324.58s]  I don't wanna fight them, I just wanna...
[9324.58s -> 9326.34s]  Wait, how much money do I have?
[9326.34s -> 9329.23s]  Oh, shit, hold on.
[9329.23s -> 9334.82s]  I need to do this.
[9334.82s -> 9337.38s]  Not enough.
[9337.38s -> 9338.93s]  Wait, what about these?
[9338.93s -> 9340.29s]  Two million, reduce the damage you take
[9340.29s -> 9342.69s]  when thrown by an enemy.
[9342.69s -> 9345.65s]  It's only two million.
[9345.65s -> 9351.25s]  Reduce the rate that the heat gauge drops down over time.
[9351.25s -> 9354.68s]  What about beast?
[9354.68s -> 9356.40s]  Increase the power of your regular attacks
[9356.40s -> 9360.81s]  and heat actions in beast style.
[9360.81s -> 9365.09s]  It's a no-brainer.
[9365.13s -> 9366.54s]  Go to the shrine.
[9366.54s -> 9368.50s]  Boost max health, yeah, of course.
[9374.91s -> 9376.19s]  What else we got?
[9376.19s -> 9377.95s]  Charge forward while keeping your guard up.
[9377.95s -> 9379.19s]  You won't be staggered by attacks
[9379.19s -> 9380.47s]  below a certain power level.
[9380.47s -> 9381.95s]  Okay, what up here?
[9389.51s -> 9390.67s]  This is kinda good.
[9390.67s -> 9399.85s]  What's after that?
[9399.85s -> 9400.69s]  This connects it.
[9400.69s -> 9403.91s]  I wanna see what's over here.
[9403.91s -> 9407.18s]  Boost the power of your attacks when in heat mode.
[9407.18s -> 9411.13s]  Yeah.
[9411.13s -> 9414.42s]  Did I just unlock this thing over here?
[9414.42s -> 9416.54s]  You are less likely to falter during a rush combo
[9416.54s -> 9417.74s]  when in heat mode.
[9417.74s -> 9423.53s]  400 million dollars!
[9423.53s -> 9424.89s]  We have a confirmed offer.
[9425.85s -> 9428.08s]  We have an offer here, hold on.
[9428.08s -> 9428.92s]  Confirmed offer, wait, wait, wait.
[9428.92s -> 9432.30s]  What is it?
[9432.30s -> 9434.74s]  Do offer, read to us green eggs and ham
[9434.74s -> 9435.90s]  without fucking up once.
[9435.90s -> 9444.11s]  Remove 75 million.
[9444.11s -> 9446.38s]  Without fucking up once?
[9446.38s -> 9451.74s]  Is that a deal?
[9451.74s -> 9455.02s]  Okay.
[9455.02s -> 9456.14s]  I don't have green eggs and ham.
[9456.14s -> 9465.48s]  I don't own it.
[9465.48s -> 9466.32s]  Okay, I got it.
[9466.32s -> 9468.37s]  No, I got it, okay.
[9468.37s -> 9470.02s]  Green eggs and ham.
[9470.02s -> 9471.14s]  I am Sam.
[9471.14s -> 9472.30s]  I am Sam.
[9472.30s -> 9473.82s]  Sam I am.
[9473.82s -> 9474.90s]  That's Sam I am.
[9474.90s -> 9476.02s]  That's Sam I am.
[9476.02s -> 9479.24s]  I do not like that Sam I am.
[9479.24s -> 9482.02s]  Do would you like green eggs and ham?
[9482.02s -> 9484.42s]  I do not like them, Sam I am.
[9484.42s -> 9487.31s]  I do not like green eggs and ham.
[9487.31s -> 9488.75s]  Would you like them here or there?
[9488.75s -> 9492.66s]  Wait, show it?
[9492.66s -> 9495.70s]  Okay, here.
[9495.70s -> 9496.78s]  All right, all right, all right, I'll do it.
[9496.78s -> 9498.22s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[9498.22s -> 9511.51s]  Hold on, I was even in the middle of something.
[9511.51s -> 9518.42s]  Okay, where is it?
[9518.42s -> 9522.68s]  You can't see it.
[9522.68s -> 9526.56s]  I love how there's an anti-aliasing here.
[9526.56s -> 9535.74s]  Can you not see it?
[9535.74s -> 9538.28s]  Is it too much text here?
[9538.28s -> 9541.12s]  I'll take a screenshot, hold on.
[9541.12s -> 9548.62s]  I have it in a text file.
[9548.62s -> 9549.58s]  You shouldn't be able to see it.
[9549.58s -> 9557.94s]  How come the, huh, that's weird.
[9557.94s -> 9560.38s]  Read it faster.
[9560.38s -> 9562.58s]  Don't get relief, have it.
[9562.58s -> 9564.82s]  Wait, what?
[9564.82s -> 9565.82s]  How come I can't get this to show?
[9565.82s -> 9568.57s]  I'll just have to take a screenshot.
[9568.57s -> 9573.75s]  It's a long book, man.
[9573.75s -> 9576.43s]  Okay, can you see if I do this?
[9576.43s -> 9585.06s]  I'm just trying to put the text on the screen.
[9585.06s -> 9588.16s]  Okay, hold on.
[9588.16s -> 9591.86s]  Is it showing up yet?
[9591.86s -> 9596.00s]  Anybody see it?
[9596.00s -> 9599.43s]  Not showing up at all.
[9599.43s -> 9604.94s]  You can't even see it at all.
[9604.94s -> 9605.78s]  No, you can't see it.
[9605.78s -> 9609.06s]  All right, so I'm using Streamlabs OBS for the last time.
[9609.06s -> 9610.34s]  It's literally the last day I'm gonna use it.
[9610.34s -> 9611.22s]  I'm uninstalling this shit
[9611.22s -> 9618.65s]  as soon as I get off the fucking stream.
[9618.65s -> 9624.20s]  Okay, hold on.
[9624.20s -> 9625.80s]  You said that last year.
[9625.80s -> 9626.64s]  I know.
[9629.82s -> 9630.66s]  I'm gonna put, hold on.
[9630.66s -> 9632.86s]  Let me just paste it and just, hold on, here.
[9632.86s -> 9635.06s]  Just, we're gonna look at some art for a second.
[9635.06s -> 9635.90s]  I'll be right back.
[9635.90s -> 9637.10s]  And plus I should piss too.
[9637.10s -> 9639.85s]  I'll get this ready.
[9639.85s -> 9640.89s]  Let's take a look at some artwork.
[9640.89s -> 9641.73s]  I'm gonna go pee.
[9641.73s -> 9644.60s]  I'm gonna get this ready and I'll do it.
[9644.60s -> 9835.18s]  Be right back.
[9835.18s -> 9839.20s]  Okay, I am back.
[9839.20s -> 9841.64s]  Let's get some, I would say music,
[9841.64s -> 9850.55s]  but can I get royalty-free cartoon music?
[9850.55s -> 9853.03s]  Background cartoon music, royalty-free.
[9853.03s -> 9860.34s]  No copyright cartoon music.
[9860.38s -> 9861.90s]  Let's see if this is good.
[9861.90s -> 9864.06s]  No copyright cartoon background music.
[9864.06s -> 9869.36s]  This is called Cartoon Pizza.
[9869.36s -> 9880.67s]  Cartoon pizza, pizza music?
[9880.67s -> 9882.52s]  Hold on.
[9882.52s -> 9889.70s]  No copyright cartoon animation background music.
[9889.70s -> 9897.98s]  Okay, that's right.
[9897.98s -> 9904.14s]  It's gonna be hard with this music in the background though.
[9904.14s -> 9905.22s]  Look at that, that looks good.
[9905.22s -> 9908.54s]  Jeremiah Hades and Otto Cerberus.
[9908.54s -> 9910.06s]  All right, give me a sec.
[9910.06s -> 9910.98s]  Let me try to get this over.
[9910.98s -> 9914.35s]  That's really good.
[9914.35s -> 9915.67s]  Boppities, what the hell is Boppities?
[9915.67s -> 9917.19s]  Boppities, that's not even a real person.
[9917.19s -> 9918.48s]  It's not.
[9918.48s -> 9919.32s]  Very good.
[9919.32s -> 9920.81s]  Very good shit.
[9920.81s -> 9921.65s]  All right, let me see.
[9921.65s -> 9923.70s]  I gotta capture this window.
[9923.70s -> 9926.66s]  Let's go back to here.
[9926.66s -> 9931.28s]  And I'm gonna, what is this an image of?
[9931.28s -> 9932.32s]  All right, I'm just gonna put this on the screen
[9932.32s -> 9938.03s]  because I don't, whatever.
[9938.03s -> 9945.62s]  I gotta hide the window for a sec, okay?
[9945.62s -> 9951.06s]  Just look at that for a minute.
[9951.06s -> 9956.74s]  Where is it?
[9956.74s -> 9957.94s]  I'm going to try to read
[9957.94s -> 9959.58s]  the entirety of Green Eggs and Ham.
[9959.58s -> 9961.10s]  I'm gonna try.
[9961.10s -> 9961.98s]  I have it here.
[9961.98s -> 9964.34s]  I just like, I just, I was there, I'm gonna try.
[9964.34s -> 9966.15s]  I'm gonna go for it.
[9966.15s -> 9972.00s]  Let's see if I can get it.
[9972.00s -> 9975.83s]  Okay, here we go.
[9975.83s -> 9981.74s]  Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss.
[9981.74s -> 9989.52s]  This is 75 million if I get it right.
[9989.52s -> 9991.33s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[9991.33s -> 9992.60s]  Ready?
[9998.54s -> 10000.65s]  Oh, hello.
[10000.65s -> 10002.17s]  Retail readings with me, Jeremy.
[10002.17s -> 10004.97s]  Today we're gonna be reading Green Eggs and Ham.
[10004.97s -> 10007.17s]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[10007.17s -> 10008.01s]  Here we go.
[10011.18s -> 10012.54s]  I am Sam.
[10012.54s -> 10013.86s]  I am Sam.
[10013.86s -> 10015.22s]  Sam I am.
[10015.22s -> 10016.10s]  That's Sam I am.
[10016.10s -> 10017.06s]  That's Sam I am.
[10017.06s -> 10019.70s]  I do not like that Sam I am.
[10019.70s -> 10022.26s]  Do would you like Green Eggs and Ham?
[10022.26s -> 10024.42s]  I do not like them, Sam I am.
[10024.42s -> 10026.98s]  I do not like Green Eggs and Ham.

[10035.66s -> 10037.62s]  I do not like them, Sam I am.
[10038.66s -> 10040.46s]  Would you like them in a house?
[10040.46s -> 10042.46s]  Would you like them with a mouse?
[10042.46s -> 10044.54s]  I do not like them in a house.

[10064.30s -> 10065.14s]  I would eat.
[10065.14s -> 10065.98s]  Ah!
[10076.22s -> 10077.46s]  Hello, everyone.
[10077.46s -> 10081.58s]  And welcome back to Fairy Tales with Jeremy Albertson.

[10089.52s -> 10091.32s]  Sam, do it again.
[10091.32s -> 10092.16s]  Do it again, do it again, do it again.

[10681.40s -> 10683.92s]  It was making me laugh because I was doing the John Oliver,
[10683.92s -> 10686.40s]  I kept seeing John Oliver in chat.
[10686.40s -> 10687.84s]  I do not like them at the most.
[10687.84s -> 10689.44s]  I do not like them here or there.
[10689.44s -> 10691.30s]  I was gonna start laughing.
[10699.92s -> 10715.44s]  Ugh, whatever else can play Yakuza, fuck it.
[10715.44s -> 10718.47s]  Did you fix your Joker impression yet?
[10718.47s -> 10720.71s]  Joker, what do you mean fix my Joker impression?
[10720.71s -> 10721.55s]  It's perfect.
[10726.78s -> 10730.06s]  I definitely, I feel like he would do that too.
[10730.06s -> 10731.38s]  Don't you feel like that in like an episode
[10731.38s -> 10734.34s]  of the John Oliver show, for Christmas this year,
[10734.34s -> 10746.32s]  he's going to read the entire greetings that I have.
[10746.32s -> 10748.44s]  Read more Dr. Seuss books, no.
[10749.44s -> 10757.51s]  All right, can I get five million off the debt for that?
[10757.51s -> 10758.35s]  If you're good at something,
[10758.35s -> 10762.08s]  never do it for free, Samayam.
[10762.08s -> 10764.00s]  By the way, why does Samayam give two shits
[10764.00s -> 10766.40s]  about what I like to eat for food?
[10766.40s -> 10775.42s]  You want to think about that?
[10775.42s -> 10777.14s]  No, you have to eat this, eat it.
[10777.14s -> 10779.78s]  I don't want it, I don't really like seafood.
[10779.78s -> 10782.18s]  No, no, no, dude, just trust me, trust me.
[10782.18s -> 10783.42s]  Just eat it, you'll love it.
[10783.42s -> 10787.24s]  I don't want it, I don't want to do that.
[10787.24s -> 10790.68s]  Stop telling me to eat foods you like.
[10790.68s -> 10793.08s]  You're missing the point, I know, try new things.
[10801.80s -> 10802.64s]  What are you doing?
[10802.64s -> 10806.92s]  You're gonna look, you're gonna link, link, link, link,
[10806.92s -> 10810.14s]  link, link, link, link, link.
[10810.14s -> 10812.41s]  What is the link?
[10812.41s -> 10814.37s]  I do not like that man, Ted Cruz.
[10815.33s -> 10817.73s]  I do not like his far right views.
[10817.73s -> 10819.41s]  I do not like his stupid chin.
[10819.41s -> 10821.57s]  I do not like his smarmy grin.
[10821.57s -> 10823.21s]  I do not like him with a beard.
[10823.21s -> 10825.23s]  I do not like him freshly sheared.
[10826.61s -> 10828.37s]  I do not like Ted Cruz at all.
[10828.37s -> 10830.69s]  That man, Ted Cruz, can suck my balls.
[10832.56s -> 10833.76s]  I don't like that man.
[10833.80s -> 10840.24s]  I do not like Ted Cruz, I don't.
[10840.24s -> 10841.08s]  What does he want?
[10841.08s -> 10842.96s]  Oh, here, take a tissue.
[10848.18s -> 10850.62s]  I can't believe it, you already did it, whatever.
[10856.44s -> 10857.96s]  Ooh, we're friends.
[10873.48s -> 10874.60s]  All right, can I please,
[10874.60s -> 10878.12s]  I just want to do a story mission for once.
[10878.12s -> 10888.40s]  Well, here's the champion district.
[10888.40s -> 10893.50s]  Excuse me, do you guys know what the champion is?
[10893.50s -> 10895.10s]  He doesn't deserve money off, what's this poll?
[10895.10s -> 10896.30s]  We got a poll, hold on.
[10896.46s -> 10901.46s]  Chat thinks you deserve 250 million off the debt for that.
[10901.74s -> 10905.06s]  Wait a minute, does German deserve 250 million off?
[10905.06s -> 10913.10s]  Oh shit, oh man, this is a vote going on right now.
[10913.42s -> 10921.58s]  Holy shit, this is 250 mil, that's coming off.
[10921.58s -> 10930.32s]  It's 71% saying yes.
[10930.32s -> 10933.16s]  The original offer was 75 for no mistakes.
[10933.16s -> 10936.66s]  Hey, I'm not keeping the books here,
[10936.66s -> 10941.82s]  I'm just the one that has to pay.
[10942.46s -> 10945.24s]  All right, that's pretty unanimous.
[10949.12s -> 10956.17s]  Fraud, fraud, rigged, stop, stop the count.
[10960.55s -> 10967.37s]  I do not like them.
[10967.37s -> 10969.89s]  All right, I'm gonna leave it up to you guys,
[10969.89s -> 10979.24s]  but that's pretty clear that it's 250 million.
[10979.24s -> 10991.95s]  Mash his head down, I want money.
[10991.95s -> 11001.15s]  Oh, links, oh, links.
[11001.15s -> 11004.49s]  Uh-oh, this, I mean, all right, no more links after this.
[11004.49s -> 11005.59s]  I'm done clicking links after this,
[11006.35s -> 11008.81s]  I wanna play Yakuza.
[11008.81s -> 11011.17s]  No mistakes, farting and screaming, one billion off.
[11011.17s -> 11013.69s]  One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.
[11013.69s -> 11015.41s]  No mistakes, farting and screaming
[11015.41s -> 11021.28s]  by reading one fish, two fish.
[11021.28s -> 11031.21s]  Oh my god, that's gonna be impossible.
[11031.21s -> 11037.06s]  I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that.
[11037.06s -> 11038.30s]  I don't think I can do it.
[11046.93s -> 11052.51s]  Okay, I'm gonna go for it.
[11052.51s -> 11055.07s]  One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.
[11055.07s -> 11058.03s]  Black fish, blue fish, old fish, new fish.
[11058.03s -> 11060.15s]  This one has a little car.
[11060.19s -> 11062.43s]  This one has a little star.
[11062.43s -> 11065.43s]  Say, what a lot of fish there are.
[11065.43s -> 11068.51s]  Yes, some are red, some are blue.
[11068.51s -> 11070.51s]  Some are old and some are new.
[11070.51s -> 11075.78s]  Some are sad and I can't, oh, I can't, I can't.
[11075.78s -> 11076.94s]  I don't care, I'm done.
[11082.51s -> 11088.02s]  I can't do that.
[11088.02s -> 11090.60s]  Once the lady screamed, it's like, I can't.
[11100.84s -> 11102.70s]  You lost, friend.
[11102.70s -> 11103.54s]  Why are you here?
[11103.54s -> 11105.36s]  There's no place in this name.
[11105.48s -> 11107.04s]  I serve a yakuza like you.
[11111.72s -> 11115.08s]  Two billion with a face cam, I can't do that.
[11115.08s -> 11117.48s]  I know, I gotta do things I know I can do.
[11117.48s -> 11119.56s]  No, I can't do it, I can't.
[11123.56s -> 11124.40s]  I can't.
[11125.88s -> 11129.40s]  That's a long book, that's like a 10 minute read.
[11129.40s -> 11131.00s]  I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[11133.00s -> 11134.60s]  No, I plan on doing soon anyways.
[11134.60s -> 11137.00s]  I wanna do like a laugh you lose thing on Twitch.
[11137.00s -> 11139.64s]  People do it and it's like just fun.
[11139.64s -> 11142.32s]  I wanna do it, I've done it like weirdly before.
[11142.32s -> 11144.92s]  No emotion, right, don't laugh for like subs and stuff.
[11144.92s -> 11147.00s]  I wanna do that like for real for the whole stream.
[11148.76s -> 11151.40s]  We'll set that up for like in like a week or two or something.
[11151.40s -> 11152.24s]  That would be fun.
[11166.98s -> 11168.78s]  Sound better today?
[11168.78s -> 11171.86s]  I might sound better, but I'm still coughing.
[11171.86s -> 11174.86s]  And you just like brought it up to the house like, hey.
[11178.45s -> 11180.33s]  I have a dry cough today, being annoying.
[11180.33s -> 11183.13s]  I think it's because my nasal turp is being annoying.
[11183.13s -> 11184.97s]  I'm definitely getting over it though.
[11184.97s -> 11190.01s]  Maybe like another day or two.
[11190.01s -> 11193.38s]  Baseball bat, I wanna end it with a, come on.

[11209.44s -> 11211.16s]  Yeah, I am negative for COVID-19.
[11211.16s -> 11212.00s]  So that's good.
[11213.52s -> 11214.96s]  It's probably just like a cold.
[11237.42s -> 11239.26s]  Is there gonna be stakes for a laugh you lose?
[11239.26s -> 11241.66s]  Oh, of course there are always stakes here.
[11241.66s -> 11243.22s]  Always high stakes here.

[11276.28s -> 11278.64s]  I can't just like sit here with the mic muted.
[11281.20s -> 11282.72s]  I don't know.
[11317.05s -> 11318.45s]  Can you please stop this yakuza bit
[11318.45s -> 11320.45s]  and go back to the Dr. Seuss stream?
[11322.28s -> 11323.12s]  No, not today.
[11336.32s -> 11337.16s]  What did he say?
[11340.08s -> 11341.16s]  Come to the place.
[11361.96s -> 11362.96s]  I'm just reading chat right now.
[11362.96s -> 11364.33s]  I gotta pay attention to the game.
[11388.69s -> 11390.69s]  Why did it change from the attitude of the other players
[11391.69s -> 11394.09s]  Why did it change from the attitude of the other place?
[11416.76s -> 11421.37s]  Just play the OG Diablo already, man.
[11421.37s -> 11422.21s]  I know you want to.
[11423.73s -> 11426.44s]  I'm not trying to be arrogant.
[11426.44s -> 11429.82s]  But, you know, you're a Diablo.
[11429.82s -> 11431.06s]  You're the one who rules.

[11465.17s -> 11466.17s]  I didn't even to read it.
[11466.17s -> 11467.54s]  What?

[11469.55s -> 11470.55s]  Come on.
[11470.55s -> 11471.55s]  No TLDR lore tweet.
[11471.55s -> 11472.72s]  Hmm.
[11472.72s -> 11473.72s]  Not good.
[11477.24s -> 11478.24s]  Are you bored?
[11478.24s -> 11479.24s]  No, of course not.
[11479.24s -> 11483.88s]  Save it though.
[11483.88s -> 11490.56s]  I'm not bored.
[11490.56s -> 11491.56s]  Hey, chef.
[11491.56s -> 11494.56s]  Thanks for the five community subs, chef piece.
[11494.56s -> 11495.56s]  Thank you.
[11495.56s -> 11499.37s]  How many times have I saved the game?
[11499.37s -> 11510.70s]  Trying just to fast track the story.
[11512.52s -> 11518.90s]  Almost several P would like to have a world with you in the discord.
[11518.90s -> 11522.98s]  But somebody wants to have a word with me in the discord, so I have to just like go
[11522.98s -> 11526.92s]  in there and just listen to them.
[11526.92s -> 11528.29s]  What?
[11528.29s -> 11531.59s]  Several people want to have a word with me in the discord.
[11531.59s -> 11535.98s]  I wonder how loud the screams are going to be when I go into voice one.
[11535.98s -> 11539.74s]  I wonder how loud it's going to be when I hurt myself.
[11539.74s -> 11547.96s]  My ears going into voice one in the discord.
[11547.96s -> 11551.08s]  That Oda guy said if I wait in the penthouse here, he'll show up.
[11551.08s -> 11553.60s]  Let's go.
[11553.60s -> 11566.46s]  You just ruined the discord.
[11566.46s -> 11568.28s]  Well, sorry.
[11568.28s -> 11572.14s]  I ain't going in there.
[11572.14s -> 11575.81s]  The fight.
[11575.81s -> 11578.81s]  If it's a fight you're looking for, it's a fight you'll get.
[11593.68s -> 11595.68s]  The next chapter is on Jima.
[11595.68s -> 11597.68s]  Is that a different city or something?
[11597.68s -> 11599.68s]  With new minigames?
[11599.68s -> 11601.68s]  I'm just trying to get through the story to play more minigames.
[11601.68s -> 11603.68s]  That's all I care about.
[11610.72s -> 11618.60s]  A young thug would come barging in and I would greet him with gentle bruising.
[11618.60s -> 11621.99s]  Oda?
[11621.99s -> 11626.85s]  Oh, it was that jerk with the germa hair.
[11644.82s -> 11645.82s]  Shit, I'm sorry.
[11645.82s -> 11646.82s]  I'm like doing this a lot off.
[11646.82s -> 11647.82s]  I'm trying to mute.
[11657.38s -> 11661.35s]  It's like 500 people in voice one.
[11661.35s -> 11662.35s]  What are you just trying to do?
[11662.35s -> 11663.35s]  Break the server?
[11663.35s -> 11665.35s]  Don't do that.
[11669.72s -> 11673.72s]  I'm sure you're all singing your own songs that you have on Spotify.
[11673.72s -> 11676.72s]  Oh, by the way, somebody said, hey, dude, do the Spotify thing where you like say what
[11676.72s -> 11678.72s]  you've been listening to on Spotify.
[11678.72s -> 11681.72s]  I don't even have Spotify installed on any device.
[11681.72s -> 11683.72s]  I've never listened to Spotify for one day.
[11690.76s -> 11696.29s]  Oh, bonus.
[11696.29s -> 11697.29s]  Lightly fast.
[11697.29s -> 11700.62s]  No, no, no, no, no, don't do that.
[11700.62s -> 11701.62s]  I want to hit somebody with it.
[11701.62s -> 11702.62s]  Oh, right in the table.
[11702.62s -> 11703.62s]  Into the table.
[11703.62s -> 11704.62s]  Into the table.
[11704.62s -> 11705.62s]  Come on, get over here.
[11705.62s -> 11706.62s]  Table, table, table, table.
[11706.62s -> 11707.62s]  Come on, WWF.
[11707.62s -> 11710.20s]  No.
[11710.20s -> 11712.20s]  I want to WWF into the table.
[11712.20s -> 11715.20s]  Holy shit, I'm going to sofa somebody in the head.
[11715.20s -> 11719.20s]  Nice.
[11719.20s -> 11721.20s]  Can I pick up the whole sofa with beast mode?
[11721.20s -> 11723.20s]  What the fuck?
[11723.20s -> 11724.20s]  What is this?
[11724.20s -> 11725.20s]  What?
[11725.20s -> 11728.89s]  Holy shit, I have a sword.
[11728.89s -> 11740.39s]  You absolutely can pick up the sofa.
[11740.39s -> 11748.07s]  I can pick up the sofa, can I?
[11748.07s -> 11752.61s]  I don't think I can.
[11752.61s -> 11761.79s]  Come here.
[11761.79s -> 11768.57s]  It was the table.
[11768.57s -> 11770.45s]  Pepe D.
[11770.45s -> 11772.45s]  What's Pepe D?
[11772.45s -> 11775.70s]  I can't see it.
[11775.70s -> 11777.70s]  Discord is omega fucked and it's your fault.
[11777.70s -> 11788.79s]  I apologize to all the Discord mods that are on Discord right now.
[11788.79s -> 11789.79s]  Scrambling.
[11789.79s -> 11791.79s]  I'm sorry.
[11791.79s -> 11797.00s]  I'm just sitting over here Pepe D-ing.
[11817.48s -> 11819.48s]  There you're pretty good in a fight.
[11819.48s -> 11822.48s]  But good enough to merit President Tachibana personally recruiting you?
[11822.48s -> 11824.48s]  I just don't know.
[11824.48s -> 11827.48s]  You'll have to fight me and throw me through this window.
[11827.48s -> 11830.48s]  Guaranteed and I'll fall onto the street and die.
[11840.78s -> 11842.78s]  What weapon is that?
[11850.48s -> 11852.48s]  He's holding that backwards.
[11854.36s -> 11856.36s]  Hold it like with the hammer pointing out.
[11856.36s -> 11858.36s]  Use the hammer side.
[11864.18s -> 11869.43s]  It's a good match.
[11869.43s -> 11871.43s]  We don't need to fight each other.
[11871.43s -> 11875.50s]  Come at me with that intention!
[11921.16s -> 11925.00s]  Take this.
[11925.00s -> 11927.00s]  Now use the sword.
[11927.00s -> 11934.21s]  Let's go!
[11934.21s -> 11935.21s]  Sunburst.
[11935.21s -> 11943.58s]  This thing is insane.
[11943.58s -> 11945.58s]  Now we're going to go beast mode.
[11945.58s -> 11951.02s]  Table smash.
[11951.02s -> 11953.02s]  He's got burst.
[11953.02s -> 11958.72s]  Stay away.
[11958.72s -> 11960.72s]  Let me dodge.
[11972.75s -> 11975.69s]  Let's go through the window.
[11976.69s -> 11981.81s]  I'm going to throw him in the window?
[11981.81s -> 11982.81s]  Heal.
[11982.81s -> 11983.81s]  Fuck.
[11983.81s -> 11992.92s]  Heal.
[11992.92s -> 11995.00s]  Fuck.
[11995.00s -> 11998.60s]  Wait.
[11998.60s -> 12001.57s]  I got heat.
[12001.57s -> 12004.92s]  I'm ready.
[12004.92s -> 12006.92s]  I want to throw him out the fucking window.
[12006.92s -> 12008.92s]  Go out the fucking window!
[12013.71s -> 12016.46s]  Do a heat move with the sword.
[12016.46s -> 12033.57s]  Got it.
[12033.57s -> 12036.58s]  God damn it.
[12036.58s -> 12037.58s]  I don't give a shit.
[12037.58s -> 12039.84s]  Whatever.
[12039.84s -> 12053.48s]  I'm just going to do all the drugs.
[12053.48s -> 12054.78s]  I got heat.
[12054.78s -> 12055.78s]  I don't even care.
[12055.78s -> 12058.79s]  I just want to play the casino game.
[12058.79s -> 12059.79s]  I don't care.
[12059.79s -> 12060.79s]  Just kill him.
[12060.79s -> 12065.87s]  Slash him once.
[12065.87s -> 12066.87s]  I don't care.
[12066.87s -> 12068.87s]  All this is just to get to the casino and go to the slot machine.
[12068.87s -> 12070.87s]  I don't give a shit about anything else that's going on.
[12080.75s -> 12083.69s]  There are no slot machines.
[12083.69s -> 12085.69s]  Why did I spend all this time playing this?
[12099.40s -> 12105.60s]  This dude's kind of cringe.
[12111.81s -> 12112.81s]  Hey, boss.
[12112.81s -> 12115.88s]  What's going on?
[12115.88s -> 12120.32s]  You tried to test me on Oda, didn't you?
[12120.32s -> 12122.32s]  Sword's really good, though.
[12122.32s -> 12123.32s]  It does a lot of damage.
[12123.32s -> 12125.13s]  Yeah.
[12125.13s -> 12128.13s]  Oda-san is an irreplaceable one-armed man to me.
[12128.13s -> 12134.68s]  That's why we needed to take his understanding in order to welcome you into our lives.
[12138.45s -> 12140.45s]  That's right.
[12140.45s -> 12143.45s]  I've been thinking of myself as a fool.
[12143.45s -> 12148.95s]  I thought you guys could have trusted me until now.
[12158.32s -> 12159.32s]  Tachibana.
[12159.32s -> 12160.32s]  It's about time.
[12160.32s -> 12163.32s]  Show me what you've been up to all this time.
[12165.32s -> 12168.32s]  Why did you come all the way here?
[12168.32s -> 12170.32s]  What's the reason for that?
[12173.13s -> 12174.13s]  Isn't that nice?
[12175.13s -> 12177.13s]  But before that,
[12178.13s -> 12181.13s]  What do you think of this town called Kamurocho?
[12181.13s -> 12183.88s]  Kamurocho?
[12184.88s -> 12185.88s]  I don't know.
[12185.88s -> 12186.88s]  I don't even care.
[12186.88s -> 12188.88s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[12190.64s -> 12192.64s]  I'm Kiryu-san.
[12192.64s -> 12198.20s]  This town is said to be the feeding ground of the Tojo Clan.
[12198.20s -> 12204.59s]  People and money gathered in this town, colored by neon, all night long.
[12204.59s -> 12211.52s]  The sweet juice from there can be sucked up by the Tojo Clan.
[12211.52s -> 12215.04s]  What are you talking about?
[12215.04s -> 12219.85s]  This town is said to be the shining light of the Tojo Clan.
[12219.85s -> 12224.72s]  I am the one who opens the casernas.
[12224.72s -> 12226.60s]  Just like this.
[12226.60s -> 12229.86s]  Play Ellen Degeneres' slots.
[12229.86s -> 12233.86s]  I won like $200 on an Ellen Degeneres slot one time.
[12233.86s -> 12237.44s]  I think it was like $300 actually.
[12237.44s -> 12248.07s]  What the hell is he doing?
[12250.33s -> 12251.33s]  What?
[12251.33s -> 12255.68s]  Why does the guy have magneto powers?
[12255.68s -> 12260.36s]  Money is power.
[12260.36s -> 12269.83s]  I want to see how far my power can reach the Tojo Clan.
[12269.83s -> 12275.61s]  But I still have a long way to go.
[12276.61s -> 12280.00s]  Oh, it's scripted.
[12280.00s -> 12281.00s]  Let's see.
[12281.00s -> 12285.00s]  He told all the people to turn the lights off for five seconds just to give me a point.
[12285.00s -> 12287.00s]  To give me a point.
[12323.04s -> 12332.41s]  I must play pocket racing.
[12332.41s -> 12336.41s]  Once I get to the new city, I'm just going to play the minigames and then turn the stream off.
[12336.41s -> 12339.41s]  I'm going to play the minigames for like two hours.
[12355.08s -> 12356.08s]  What?
[12356.08s -> 12357.08s]  That's my friend.
[12357.08s -> 12359.08s]  That's the guy that I know.
[12359.08s -> 12361.71s]  That's the person that's my friend.
[12388.33s -> 12389.33s]  The secret.
[12389.33s -> 12390.33s]  I'm the secret.
[12400.10s -> 12404.10s]  I feel like I'm jumping in halfway through a movie that I have not seen any of.
[12404.10s -> 12406.10s]  And I've been here the whole time.
[12407.85s -> 12409.85s]  Hey, what are you watching, man?
[12409.85s -> 12412.85s]  Oh, this is the cool movie called Yakuza Zero.
[12412.85s -> 12414.85s]  Oh, let's sit down and just watch it.
[12414.85s -> 12415.85s]  Whatever.
[12415.85s -> 12416.85s]  Who's this guy?
[12416.85s -> 12417.85s]  Who's that guy?
[12418.85s -> 12420.85s]  What city are they in?
[12420.85s -> 12421.85s]  I don't know, man.
[12421.85s -> 12422.85s]  You got to just jump in.
[12422.85s -> 12427.29s]  Just chill.
[12435.35s -> 12437.35s]  Are you playing a game you don't care about?
[12437.35s -> 12440.35s]  I care very much about this game and all the fun stuff to do in it.
[12440.35s -> 12441.35s]  I care about this game.
[12441.35s -> 12442.35s]  I think it's really good.
[12442.35s -> 12444.35s]  I like I really like this game.
[12450.51s -> 12455.51s]  I love the little side campaigns like the fun stuff and like the minigames and like the fighting.
[12456.51s -> 12458.51s]  I like this game.
[12470.99s -> 12473.76s]  Stop.
[12480.84s -> 12481.84s]  Stop.
[12481.84s -> 12482.84s]  Stop.

[12489.84s -> 12491.84s]  Name five characters to erase.
[12491.84s -> 12492.84s]  How much?
[12496.01s -> 12497.01s]  All right.

[12515.70s -> 12516.70s]  Who's the fifth?
[12517.70s -> 12518.70s]  Okay.

[12539.99s -> 12540.99s]  Dojima.
[12540.99s -> 12542.87s]  Dojima is one.
[12542.87s -> 12543.87s]  Dojima is the family.

[12548.96s -> 12549.96s]  The Dojimas.
[12562.92s -> 12563.92s]  Technically counts.
[12575.47s -> 12576.47s]  God damn it.
[12576.47s -> 12577.47s]  Why?
[12579.47s -> 12580.47s]  I really do like the game though.
[12580.47s -> 12581.47s]  It's like fun.
[12581.47s -> 12582.47s]  As much as I'm not like paying attention.
[12582.47s -> 12583.47s]  I know.
[12583.47s -> 12584.47s]  But like...
[12584.47s -> 12585.47s]  I can't.
[12585.47s -> 12586.47s]  It's hard to pay attention.
[12586.47s -> 12587.47s]  I need like action.
[12587.47s -> 12589.47s]  I need like stuff to happen like right now.
[12589.47s -> 12590.47s]  You know what I mean?
[12590.47s -> 12591.47s]  I like it though.

[12687.98s -> 12688.98s]  I'm dancing.

[13925.34s -> 13932.14s]  Alright, cool. And there's like an S here? Save point.
[13932.14s -> 13947.05s]  Oh, nice. How much money do I have in my bank account on this guy?
[13947.05s -> 13959.21s]  30,000 yen? What? I managed like a big hotel casino entertainment venue. I only got 30,000 yen in my pocket?
[13959.21s -> 13961.21s]  Should be four zeros added to that.
[13961.21s -> 13970.41s]  Alright, dressing room. Where's the dressing room?
[13970.41s -> 13974.00s]  Wait, wait, wait. Let's talk to these guys.
[13975.00s -> 13977.00s]  Let's see how they're doing.
[13978.43s -> 13982.83s]  Can I talk?
[13983.83s -> 13988.83s]  What an incredible spot. I had no idea Sotenbori was hiding such a gem.
[13989.83s -> 13992.83s]  I've been making this my regular spot whenever I'm in town.
[13994.26s -> 13998.26s]  I mean, I'm just like, look. Oh, he's paying attention now. He like wants to talk to everybody.
[13998.26s -> 14002.26s]  He's in like the casino. He's in like the fucking hotel. Like, let's go. Welcome to Vegas.
[14003.26s -> 14005.26s]  Whatever. Alright. It's interesting to me. I like it.
[14012.64s -> 14014.64s]  Where are the dressing rooms though? Just walk around?
[14014.64s -> 14026.53s]  I'm gonna go down.
[14026.53s -> 14033.44s]  Got a minute.
[14034.44s -> 14036.44s]  Oh, sorry about that. What can I do for you?
[14037.44s -> 14040.44s]  Can you call Kane for me? I need to talk to her.
[14040.44s -> 14042.81s]  Yes, sir. Of course.
[14042.81s -> 14049.53s]  This deal is spacing out on the clock.
[14049.53s -> 14058.30s]  Hi, sir. Nice work out there tonight.
[14059.30s -> 14061.30s]  Thanks, Kane-chan.
[14061.30s -> 14063.60s]  So, you wanted to talk to me?
[14063.60s -> 14067.23s]  She said she was locking horns with Sakurako.
[14068.23s -> 14070.71s]  Hmm. Where do I start?
[14070.71s -> 14072.71s]  Hmm. Alright. Do we lay down the law?
[14072.71s -> 14074.71s]  I think not. I think we'd be like, hey.
[14074.71s -> 14080.79s]  Let's talk for a minute here.
[14080.79s -> 14082.79s]  Yeah, you're really smoking tonight, babe.
[14082.79s -> 14085.79s]  I thought some new idol singer wandered in.
[14086.79s -> 14091.03s]  Oh, you. That kind of flattery won't get anybody but paying customers anywhere, sir.
[14091.03s -> 14093.03s]  What? Is that wrong?
[14094.20s -> 14096.20s]  That right? I take it back then.
[14096.20s -> 14098.20s]  What? So it was just flattery, huh?
[14098.20s -> 14100.20s]  You wound me, boss.
[14100.20s -> 14103.20s]  Aw, come on. You know I can't tell a lie.
[14103.20s -> 14105.20s]  Here, I'll buy you dinner sometime soon. You forgive me?
[14106.20s -> 14108.20s]  Really? Oh, I'd love you, sir.
[14109.20s -> 14111.20s]  This is idiotic. Time to get to the point.
[14112.20s -> 14114.20s]  It's been about a month since you came on here.
[14114.20s -> 14118.20s]  Yeah? How's it going? Think you can make a real go of it at the Grand?
[14118.20s -> 14125.98s]  Oh, I think so. The hall is much bigger than the last club I worked at, so it was pretty daunting at first, but I'm totally used to it now.
[14125.98s -> 14134.61s]  And more and more and more customers are coming here specifically to see me.
[14134.61s -> 14136.85s]  Yeah? That's great to hear.
[14136.85s -> 14141.85s]  Not surprising from the number one gal from one of the oldest cabarets in the Kita area.
[14141.85s -> 14143.85s]  I guess I was imagining things then.
[14143.85s -> 14146.60s]  Hmm? What do you mean?
[14146.60s -> 14151.60s]  Oh, see, the one month mark's actually when I see that most girls up and leave.
[14151.60s -> 14154.78s]  I was a little worried you might be getting the itch too.
[14154.78s -> 14158.72s]  Oh, have no fear of that. I wouldn't dream of quitting now.
[14159.72s -> 14166.16s]  That hag Sakurako's been trying to play the seniority card on me, but I don't even notice her.
[14166.16s -> 14170.59s]  Damn, girl. Hag? This is pretty serious.
[14170.59s -> 14179.64s]  Aw, don't be like that. Sakurako's a vet here. She looks after the other girls too. Most love that about her.
[14179.64s -> 14181.82s]  Try to get along, yeah?
[14181.82s -> 14187.12s]  Oh, I hate nosy types like that. And she's got a whole entourage.
[14187.12s -> 14190.30s]  Whatever, soon I'll have my own clique and I won't have to deal with them.
[14190.30s -> 14193.99s]  Does she even realize she's getting lectured here?
[14193.99s -> 14195.99s]  Dan says adored this one.
[14195.99s -> 14197.99s]  She's even giving me a little too.
[14197.99s -> 14202.76s]  All right, we're gonna go more direct.
[14202.76s -> 14209.12s]  Direct. Better make it loud and clear for her.
[14209.12s -> 14210.81s]  That ain't right.
[14210.81s -> 14211.81s]  What kind of a champ?
[14211.81s -> 14213.81s]  You gotta learn to read the room.
[14213.81s -> 14215.31s]  Huh?
[14215.31s -> 14219.32s]  Doesn't matter how good you are at your job or how popular you get.
[14219.32s -> 14224.32s]  You've snubbed your seniors like that and you'll wake up one day with nothing but enemies here.
[14224.32s -> 14229.20s]  Fine by me, not like I do the job to make friends with the other girls.
[14229.20s -> 14240.80s]  Really? That the best you can do? I'm disappointed. I doubt you'll be around here long enough to make those enemies, then.
[14240.80s -> 14245.36s]  Wait, what's that supposed to mean? Is there a problem with my work?
[14245.36s -> 14252.48s]  Nailed it. She's the competitive type. With her pride on the hook, she'll take the bait.
[14252.48s -> 14259.11s]  Look, I ain't asking you to be friends with Sakuro-chan. In fact, you two make much better rivals.
[14259.11s -> 14264.72s]  Rivals? Yeah. Well, not the kind that shanks the other in the back.
[14264.72s -> 14269.89s]  Compete. Puss each other. Get better. You'll bring up all the other girls with you.
[14269.89s -> 14275.88s]  Stop the accent. What? You don't like it? You guys don't like the accent?
[14275.88s -> 14281.06s]  You guys don't like it? You don't like it? You don't like it?
[14281.06s -> 14286.58s]  Right now. Right now. You're just tripping over each other.
[14286.58s -> 14289.88s]  And that makes it harder for everybody around you to step up.
[14289.88s -> 14295.64s]  Customers may love a gal like that, but I got no use for them here.
[14295.64s -> 14301.01s]  The grand needs girls who are popular with the guys and the girls.
[14301.01s -> 14303.44s]  The guys and the girls?
[14303.44s -> 14306.68s]  Thing is, I know you could be that girl.
[14306.68s -> 14311.68s]  Kanae-chan, that's the only reason I'm coming down on you about it. I like this.
[14311.68s -> 14316.37s]  You really think I'm... I'm sorry, sir. I was acting like a spoiled brat.
[14316.37s -> 14320.37s]  I work on being that girl. I'm being more considerate. Please, give me the chance.
[14320.37s -> 14325.54s]  There, see? You do get it. I knew you were a keeper.
[14325.54s -> 14327.97s]  I knew you were a keeper, kid.
[14327.97s -> 14331.85s]  And I hope you'll keep helping me improve when I need it.
[14331.85s -> 14338.36s]  Matthew McConaughey.
[14338.36s -> 14340.36s]  Ah, finally. Took long enough.
[14340.36s -> 14342.36s]  Shit.
[14342.36s -> 14345.49s]  And wait. What was that waiter's deal?
[14345.49s -> 14348.49s]  Can't have him zoning out on me like that.
[14348.49s -> 14350.67s]  Better go have a chat.
[14350.67s -> 14354.64s]  This car goes fast, but it's safe, too.
[14354.64s -> 14356.95s]  Know what I'm saying?
[14356.95s -> 14363.78s]  When you drive a Lincoln, sophistication is key.
[14363.78s -> 14379.25s]  Okay, cool. That worked.
[14379.25s -> 14381.25s]  What else can I do? I'm gonna talk to this guy.
[14381.25s -> 14386.16s]  Quit while you're ahead.
[14386.16s -> 14389.16s]  Why the long face? Need to use facilities?
[14389.16s -> 14393.97s]  Sir, no, no. I got a letter from my little sister back home.
[14393.97s -> 14395.97s]  Yeah? What's the word?
[14395.97s -> 14398.92s]  My father's sick, unfortunately.
[14398.92s -> 14404.16s]  The doc says he needs to be hospitalized, but the procedure they want to do runs 500,000.
[14404.16s -> 14406.52s]  But I ain't got that kind of cash.
[14406.52s -> 14408.76s]  Sorry to hear that.
[14408.76s -> 14411.76s]  You try asking the floor manager for advance?
[14411.76s -> 14415.13s]  Another emergency a while back already forced me to ask for one.
[14415.13s -> 14417.13s]  I'm afraid if I ask again, I'll get canned.
[14417.13s -> 14419.13s]  Especially for so much.
[14419.13s -> 14422.82s]  You in the habit of breaking mirrors, kid?
[14422.82s -> 14425.82s]  Here, I'll spot you.
[14425.82s -> 14428.76s]  What? But sir, I can't.
[14428.76s -> 14432.07s]  Don't sweat it. You can always replace money.
[14432.07s -> 14438.46s]  Saying can be said about people. Once they're gone, that's it.
[14438.46s -> 14444.60s]  Sir, as I recall, you ain't been back home in a while.
[14444.60s -> 14448.84s]  Yeah? Take a few days off, too. Go visit your pops.
[14448.84s -> 14456.95s]  Gosh. Thank you, sir.
[14456.95s -> 14459.95s]  Only thing that matters right now is keeping this place running smooth.
[14459.95s -> 14463.19s]  I'll throw as much money at it as I need to.
[14463.19s -> 14465.49s]  I'm having fun. I don't care.
[14465.49s -> 14467.49s]  Looks like that's it for my staff troubles.
[14467.49s -> 14469.49s]  It's about time I checked in out of the hole.
[14469.49s -> 14471.49s]  See what's going on outside.
[14474.01s -> 14482.27s]  Ban that person for a day!
[14482.27s -> 14486.27s]  One of the customers is placing insane orders now that he knows he isn't paying for it.
[14486.27s -> 14489.51s]  He went down the line of our top vintage wines to start,
[14489.51s -> 14492.51s]  and he started on our best whiskeys and brandies.
[14492.51s -> 14495.84s]  Well, I mean, when you hear the words,
[14495.84s -> 14498.84s]  this guy's gonna pay for every drink, it's like,
[14498.84s -> 14501.84s]  okay, let's go to the bottom of the wine list.
[14501.84s -> 14503.84s]  Let's turn the page three times.
[14503.84s -> 14506.84s]  We're gonna go to the bottom.
[14506.84s -> 14510.78s]  Start at the priciest and work your way down the list, huh?
[14510.78s -> 14517.76s]  Guys, this is the only way he's going to read and comprehend the story.
[14517.76s -> 14520.76s]  Well, somebody gets it, but, okay.
[14520.76s -> 14522.76s]  Start at the priciest.
[14525.83s -> 14527.07s]  Shit.
[14527.07s -> 14529.07s]  Now, I haven't been paying attention.
[14529.07s -> 14532.07s]  I haven't been paying attention. I haven't read anything.
[14532.07s -> 14535.07s]  I haven't comprehended a word.
[14535.07s -> 14543.84s]  Right this way.
[14543.84s -> 14545.84s]  Fine, just do the accent.
[14547.65s -> 14550.02s]  Oh, goddammit.
[14564.92s -> 14569.05s]  We have to dodge this guy, too.
[14591.40s -> 14593.40s]  He's already such a dick.
[14593.40s -> 14597.64s]  Don't you think he'd be like, oh, my god, I'm doing all this expensive stuff.
[14597.64s -> 14601.52s]  Don't you think he'd be like, oh, my god, I'm doing all this expensive shit.
[14601.52s -> 14603.52s]  Yeah, what can I do for you?
[14603.52s -> 14605.52s]  All right, I'll cool it. I'll cool it.
[14605.52s -> 14607.52s]  I won't order anymore. I'm sorry.
[14607.52s -> 14610.52s]  I've got a little ahead of myself.
[14610.52s -> 14616.02s]  I have to be his dick.
[14650.44s -> 14654.75s]  I don't know. I thought I was going to microwave the cigarettes.
[14654.75s -> 14656.75s]  I've got to reheat these cigarettes.
[14656.75s -> 14658.75s]  They're getting cold.
[14670.24s -> 14672.24s]  Oh, that's not even a microwave.
[14672.24s -> 14674.24s]  It's a hot towel bin.
[14683.62s -> 14686.82s]  You get a raid?
[14686.82s -> 14688.82s]  Who raided?
[14688.82s -> 14690.82s]  Raid? I don't see a raid.
[14690.82s -> 14693.49s]  Where? Where? I don't see one.
[14693.49s -> 14697.59s]  I don't see a raid. Who raided?
[14697.59s -> 14699.76s]  Is it your raid? I don't see it anywhere.
[14707.06s -> 14711.03s]  Whoever raided it, he did.
[14711.03s -> 14716.40s]  What's up? Thanks.
[14716.40s -> 14718.40s]  I don't see it anywhere.
[14722.40s -> 14724.40s]  What happened?
[14724.40s -> 14731.04s]  Oh.
[14734.60s -> 14736.60s]  I'm sorry.
[14736.60s -> 14738.60s]  I'm sorry.
[14754.96s -> 14756.96s]  What's up?
[14756.96s -> 14758.96s]  I don't see a raid.
[14758.96s -> 14760.96s]  I don't see a raid.
[14760.96s -> 14768.12s]  I don't see a raid.
[14768.12s -> 14769.32s]  I did not expect that.
[14770.77s -> 14772.01s]  It's a shame.
[14772.45s -> 14776.89s]  You, who on the outside is jealous of others,
[14776.91s -> 14779.25s]  is all alone, in this town in search of something else.
[14780.93s -> 14784.75s]  People who call themselves happy are all doing the same as you.
[14785.76s -> 14787.58s]  Isn't the weather hot today?
[14788.91s -> 14792.13s]  I feel like I saw you in your dimples.
[14793.05s -> 14793.91s]  But, well.
[14794.39s -> 14798.39s]  This is the situation you're into, no?
[14798.39s -> 14821.78s]  Oh, this is punishment back in the Yakuza
[14836.22s -> 14840.79s]  Retainer to the fifth only Alliance chairman there was a lot I couldn't read it all
[14841.57s -> 14843.49s]  Anta New York, I don't need to know
[14852.97s -> 14853.97s]  This month I'm going to sell
[14855.09s -> 14858.73s]  This month's take is that I can keep a case you'll have your 100 million by next month
[14860.33s -> 14862.81s]  Oh, that's amazing
[14864.12s -> 14864.76s]  Don't be stupid
[14865.96s -> 14869.96s]  If you get it, I'll tell Shimano's dad that I can go back to the Gokudo
[14871.20s -> 14872.88s]  I haven't forgotten my promise
[14874.18s -> 14877.38s]  Well, did you make that promise?
[14878.77s -> 14881.05s]  I'm not going to be able to make a joke out of this
[14882.29s -> 14882.97s]  No, you can't
[14883.73s -> 14886.17s]  I'll give you another 500 million
[14886.17s -> 14887.61s]  If you do that, I'll listen to you
[14888.17s -> 14888.97s]  That's bullshit
[14890.50s -> 14892.62s]  You weasley rat bastard
[14893.50s -> 14896.70s]  Oh, no, I can't do that
[14897.34s -> 14897.74s]  Shit
[14898.62s -> 14901.18s]  What? You're not going to hit me?
[14901.18s -> 14904.30s]  Well, I can't do it, but
[14905.70s -> 14906.66s]  I thought he was going to do it
[14909.09s -> 14910.33s]  If you do that
[14911.22s -> 14914.30s]  You're going to go back to that dark place
[14915.33s -> 14916.53s]  I don't want that
[14916.53s -> 14917.29s]  Oh shit
[14919.58s -> 14923.02s]  This is the way you want to go back to the world
[14924.76s -> 14926.92s]  Yakuza is like you
[14927.56s -> 14928.76s]  It's easy to let go
[14928.76s -> 14929.72s]  Oh, you fuckers
[14930.28s -> 14930.76s]  What do you think?
[14931.78s -> 14933.78s]  I think you should take revenge
[14934.42s -> 14947.44s]  I'll make a lot of money
[14947.96s -> 14952.22s]  If I do it to go back to Gokudo, I'll do anything
[14952.86s -> 14957.58s]  Oh, you're in the same debt pit as Mojima
[14961.90s -> 14962.78s]  I like Mojima
[14962.78s -> 14963.10s]  He's
[14967.36s -> 14969.40s]  2 billion, 3 billion, 4 billion
[14970.56s -> 14979.74s]  Add another 500 to the debt
[14979.74s -> 14980.18s]  Yeah
[14994.03s -> 14995.63s]  How much are you getting paid to play this game?
[14996.63s -> 14998.71s]  I don't know how much you guys gave me today
[15001.11s -> 15001.87s]  How about zero?
[15016.26s -> 15016.82s]  What about her?
[15016.82s -> 15017.94s]  Yeah, what's his deal?
[15021.26s -> 15022.14s]  Hey, what?
[15026.09s -> 15027.09s]  Oh, no
[15029.21s -> 15030.21s]  They're separating us
[15034.48s -> 15037.18s]  I'll do my best not to lose the deal
[15037.18s -> 15041.18s]  I have to earn 500,000 yen after all
[15042.18s -> 15051.44s]  That's not good
[15062.27s -> 15063.31s]  Pardon me, sir
[15063.31s -> 15066.99s]  I just got a call from Noriko-chan saying she's jumping ship to a different club
[15068.78s -> 15070.94s]  Yeah, I just found out
[15070.94s -> 15073.18s]  Did you know?
[15073.18s -> 15075.18s]  Why are you so sudden?
[15075.18s -> 15078.94s]  If Noriko-chan is gone, it will have a big impact on the sales
[15080.32s -> 15082.06s]  I know
[15082.06s -> 15083.90s]  But it's the owner's decision
[15084.88s -> 15086.99s]  There's nothing we can do about it
[15086.99s -> 15089.55s]  Is that so?
[15089.55s -> 15094.52s]  But what should we do from now on?
[15094.52s -> 15096.37s]  Damn it
[15096.37s -> 15097.57s]  There's no time to get depressed
[15097.57s -> 15098.49s]  Look at that, what about it?
[15098.49s -> 15101.53s]  Who's the hottest hostess in town that we don't already have?
[15101.53s -> 15105.47s]  Who's the hottest hostess in town that we don't already have?
[15105.47s -> 15107.47s]  A hostess from somewhere else?
[15107.47s -> 15111.42s]  If it's a girl from somewhere else, that's right
[15111.42s -> 15114.58s]  Nozomi-chan from Odyssey is the clear winner
[15114.58s -> 15117.02s]  She's a big part of why they're the strongest rival
[15117.02s -> 15119.50s]  Nozomi-chan from Odyssey is the clear winner
[15119.50s -> 15120.54s]  I see
[15120.58s -> 15121.82s]  Yeah?
[15121.82s -> 15122.82s]  Well then
[15122.82s -> 15124.82s]  Well then, I guess I'll be heading out
[15124.82s -> 15125.82s]  I guess I'll be heading out
[15125.82s -> 15126.82s]  Not too soon though
[15126.82s -> 15127.82s]  Not too soon though
[15127.82s -> 15128.82s]  Hey, Shion!
[15128.82s -> 15129.82s]  Where are you going?
[15129.82s -> 15131.06s]  See you around, kid
[15131.06s -> 15132.06s]  Of course I will
[15132.06s -> 15134.43s]  I'm going to take Nozomi out of our house
[15134.43s -> 15136.43s]  I'm going to be poaching Nozomi to come to our floor
[15136.43s -> 15138.43s]  Taking out the number one rival?
[15138.43s -> 15141.43s]  Isn't that bad?
[15141.43s -> 15144.43s]  How are we supposed to do that?
[15144.43s -> 15147.43s]  The world at night is full of evil
[15147.43s -> 15149.43s]  If we fall here, we'll be crushed
[15149.47s -> 15151.47s]  The strong eat the weak
[15151.47s -> 15152.47s]  We true
[15152.47s -> 15155.47s]  And the grand will come crumbling down in days
[15155.47s -> 15157.47s]  My job is to do what it takes
[15157.47s -> 15158.47s]  To...
[15158.47s -> 15161.47s]  Can you run back the prompter?
[15161.47s -> 15164.63s]  I'll get it again, don't worry
[15164.63s -> 15165.63s]  I promise
[15165.63s -> 15170.88s]  Alright, we gotta go get that other girl to come over here
[15170.88s -> 15171.88s]  And do...
[15171.88s -> 15173.88s]  And be at our hotel
[15177.77s -> 15179.77s]  Netflix dub
[15184.38s -> 15187.98s]  Do karaoke?
[15187.98s -> 15189.22s]  I did karaoke
[15189.22s -> 15191.22s]  I wanna go check out the town
[15191.26s -> 15192.26s]  Do I have access to the town now?
[15192.26s -> 15196.68s]  You know what a cabaret is?
[15196.68s -> 15197.86s]  Yeah
[15197.86s -> 15211.26s]  It's a...
[15211.26s -> 15213.58s]  It's like a performance
[15213.58s -> 15217.58s]  It's a short performance of music and theater and dance
[15217.58s -> 15221.08s]  Like a bunch of dancing and singing and performances
[15221.08s -> 15224.11s]  Go to Odyssey
[15224.11s -> 15227.11s]  Ooh, okay, we have a town here
[15227.11s -> 15228.42s]  Oh, look at this
[15228.42s -> 15229.42s]  Okay, what's this?
[15229.42s -> 15230.42s]  Shot bar
[15230.42s -> 15232.42s]  Bart with darts and pool
[15232.42s -> 15235.87s]  There's the cabaret
[15235.87s -> 15237.82s]  There's...
[15237.82s -> 15238.82s]  Oh, and the arcade
[15238.82s -> 15244.02s]  Alright, we'll go to the bars with darts and pool
[15244.06s -> 15246.01s]  Let's go
[15247.50s -> 15248.50s]  You there
[15248.50s -> 15250.90s]  Huh?
[15250.90s -> 15259.64s]  You are the master of the Hell House, the Grand, yes?
[15259.64s -> 15260.64s]  Yeah
[15260.64s -> 15261.64s]  Yeah, that's me
[15261.64s -> 15262.64s]  I knew it
[15262.64s -> 15264.64s]  Even the way you walk is refined
[15264.64s -> 15266.64s]  Guarded, you have no blind spot
[15266.64s -> 15267.64s]  Despite appearances
[15267.64s -> 15271.07s]  I'm sorry, sir, have we met before?
[15271.07s -> 15273.07s]  My name is Sumotaro Komike
[15273.07s -> 15277.07s]  Heir to a certain form of martial arts in its present master
[15277.07s -> 15278.57s]  Martial arts?
[15278.57s -> 15281.94s]  Yes, but lately I've felt my technique slipping
[15281.98s -> 15283.98s]  My edge has been dulled
[15283.98s -> 15286.98s]  So I left the lights of Tokyo in order to train
[15286.98s -> 15290.28s]  Yet even here I find this age of excess
[15290.28s -> 15293.28s]  Gluttons and fools gorging on carnal pleasures
[15293.28s -> 15295.28s]  Nobody hungers anymore
[15295.28s -> 15298.71s]  Then I heard talk of a lounge called the Grand
[15298.71s -> 15302.71s]  They said it was the home of a most interesting man
[15302.71s -> 15304.53s]  Pardon my answer
[15304.53s -> 15307.90s]  But have you visited our establishment before?
[15307.90s -> 15309.52s]  What kind of question is that?
[15309.52s -> 15312.52s]  Guttling booze with painted ladies hanging all over you
[15312.56s -> 15314.56s]  Bah! Wanted excess
[15314.56s -> 15316.56s]  Of course I haven't been there
[15316.56s -> 15322.14s]  Well, then why the hell am I doing song and dance if you ain't accustomed?
[15322.14s -> 15326.45s]  Besides, that's a washed-up martial art as well with me
[15326.45s -> 15328.82s]  That hungry air about you
[15328.82s -> 15331.82s]  It is far beyond the men I've fought in recent years
[15331.82s -> 15333.82s]  Would you do me the honor?
[15333.82s -> 15336.57s]  What honor would that be?
[15336.57s -> 15338.57s]  Want me to fight you?
[15338.57s -> 15339.57s]  Precisely
[15339.57s -> 15341.57s]  A deeper strength sleeps within you
[15341.61s -> 15344.61s]  I refuse to let it lie dormant and unused any longer
[15344.61s -> 15346.61s]  What?
[15346.61s -> 15348.91s]  You okay upstairs, pal?
[15348.91s -> 15351.91s]  You don't earn me skinny hands profit
[15351.91s -> 15354.28s]  Busy gal
[15354.28s -> 15355.28s]  Busy guy
[15355.28s -> 15358.28s]  Hide behind your merchant's guise all you like
[15358.28s -> 15360.28s]  I know money isn't what feeds that hunger
[15360.28s -> 15362.28s]  Whatever honest life you make
[15362.28s -> 15365.28s]  A show of living I can see the demon gnawing at you inside
[15365.28s -> 15366.28s]  Hmm
[15366.28s -> 15370.46s]  There's only one way to appease the demon, son
[15370.50s -> 15372.50s]  Face the strong in combat
[15372.50s -> 15375.50s]  And set loose those fighting instincts struggling to burst free
[15375.50s -> 15379.26s]  And you're telling me you're that strong guy?
[15379.26s -> 15381.26s]  Oh, as it happens, I am
[15381.26s -> 15383.26s]  Now do you see a reason to face me?
[15383.26s -> 15385.26s]  Not that it will stay any...
[15385.26s -> 15387.26s]  It won't be very easy for you
[15387.26s -> 15389.88s]  There's no talking sense to you, is there?
[15389.88s -> 15391.44s]  Fine
[15391.44s -> 15393.44s]  You win
[15393.44s -> 15396.44s]  I was just thinking it had been a while since I really cut loose
[15396.44s -> 15397.44s]  Not here though
[15397.44s -> 15398.44s]  Somewhere
[15398.44s -> 15399.44s]  Somewhere
[15399.44s -> 15400.74s]  Not here
[15400.78s -> 15404.11s]  Hmm, if you insist
[15404.11s -> 15405.11s]  Who talks like that?
[15405.11s -> 15413.84s]  Me
[15413.84s -> 15414.84s]  This place should work
[15414.84s -> 15417.02s]  Hmm, you are awfully...
[15417.02s -> 15418.02s]  It's a different guy
[15418.02s -> 15419.02s]  You are... It's the same person
[15419.02s -> 15421.02s]  You are awfully unhesitant to agree...
[15421.02s -> 15422.02s]  I wasn't paying attention
[15422.02s -> 15426.02s]  In agreeing to this, I am starting to think you keep the true extent of your strength hidden away
[15426.02s -> 15430.66s]  You must have your reasons, I know I have mine
[15430.66s -> 15432.66s]  For the fist is like the sword
[15432.66s -> 15434.66s]  Leave it in its sheath to rust
[15434.66s -> 15436.66s]  And you will not be able to draw it when it is needed
[15436.66s -> 15438.84s]  What say you?
[15438.88s -> 15440.88s]  Do you feel an urge to shrug off your restraints
[15440.88s -> 15442.88s]  And fight to the full extent of your abilities for a change?
[15442.88s -> 15445.95s]  You're offering?
[15445.95s -> 15446.95s]  I'm game
[15446.95s -> 15448.95s]  Not too big on the idea of opening up a can
[15448.95s -> 15450.95s]  Of a creaky old guy like you
[15450.95s -> 15452.19s]  Though
[15452.19s -> 15457.54s]  Fuck
[15457.54s -> 15460.68s]  No, cast aside such worries
[15460.68s -> 15461.68s]  He even doddled to the edge left
[15461.68s -> 15463.68s]  And these should prove sufficient to handle a pup like you
[15463.68s -> 15465.68s]  Show me everything you've got
[15465.68s -> 15468.26s]  He's throwing
[15468.26s -> 15469.26s]  Alright, I'm done
[15469.26s -> 15475.70s]  A thug style incorporates a number of merciless attacks
[15475.70s -> 15477.70s]  One of these is the eye pope
[15477.74s -> 15480.05s]  You land an eye poke attack
[15480.05s -> 15482.05s]  The enemy will turn their back to you in pain
[15482.05s -> 15484.93s]  Eye poke?
[15494.32s -> 15500.14s]  Holy shit, I just dropped him
[15500.14s -> 15502.14s]  One of the special moves of the thug style
[15502.14s -> 15504.14s]  Is a heat action called the essence of choking
[15504.14s -> 15507.14s]  This heat action triggers when an enemy attacks you
[15507.14s -> 15509.14s]  Or when you just circle behind them
[15509.14s -> 15511.96s]  Okay
[15511.96s -> 15513.96s]  The heat gauge at third press Y when an enemy attacks
[15513.96s -> 15515.96s]  Yeah, we've seen this
[15515.96s -> 15521.70s]  Oh my god, I just broke that fucking old dude's neck
[15521.74s -> 15531.74s]  Defeat him
[15531.74s -> 15532.74s]  And run at me, run at me
[15532.74s -> 15534.74s]  Come on, come get me
[15534.74s -> 15537.33s]  He'll snap his neck
[15537.33s -> 15543.15s]  The essence of murder
[15544.15s -> 15551.77s]  Holy shit
[15551.77s -> 15561.78s]  Dropping frames?
[15561.78s -> 15562.78s]  Am I?
[15562.78s -> 15566.13s]  Oh, I did drop some
[15566.13s -> 15572.42s]  We good?
[15572.42s -> 15577.16s]  Yeah, the internet's been a little weird here
[15577.16s -> 15579.16s]  The last couple of nights
[15579.16s -> 15582.68s]  I've had like small internet hiccups
[15582.68s -> 15584.68s]  Over the last like maybe two nights
[15584.68s -> 15594.92s]  No, it should be good
[15594.92s -> 15605.20s]  I mean, I haven't had internet problems in like a year
[15605.20s -> 15607.20s]  I mean, I'm on fiber
[15607.24s -> 15609.24s]  I have a thousand thousand
[15609.24s -> 15611.24s]  But sometimes I'm sure it can happen
[15613.54s -> 15625.26s]  I don't have my VPN on right now
[15625.26s -> 15627.26s]  But yeah, the last two nights
[15627.26s -> 15629.43s]  After like 8 o'clock at night
[15629.43s -> 15631.43s]  For some reason it's gotten like a little weird
[15631.43s -> 15633.43s]  I'll give him a call
[15633.43s -> 15637.78s]  See if anything's going on
[15637.78s -> 15649.43s]  Is it still dropping frames?
[15649.43s -> 15652.95s]  Oh, it is, yeah
[15652.95s -> 15656.73s]  Oh shit, it is, yeah
[15656.73s -> 15660.70s]  It is happening
[15660.70s -> 15662.70s]  It might be doing like maintenance or something
[15662.74s -> 15663.74s]  A few nights
[15663.74s -> 15666.68s]  Because it's been like the same time every night
[15668.92s -> 15671.12s]  I'll give him a call
[15671.12s -> 15679.50s]  See what's going on
[15679.50s -> 15681.50s]  Yeah, it's been like 8 months since there's been any internet problems
[15681.50s -> 15683.50s]  It's been perfect
[15683.50s -> 15686.00s]  I've had almost zero problems at all
[15686.00s -> 15688.00s]  But yeah, I'm definitely dropping a shitload of frames so I can see it
[15690.00s -> 15705.73s]  Hold on, one sec
[15705.73s -> 15708.93s]  Let me just see what happens when I do this
[15708.93s -> 15712.26s]  Let's find out
[15712.26s -> 15718.98s]  Sorry about that
[15718.98s -> 15720.98s]  They're trying to block Majima
[15721.02s -> 15729.08s]  Yeah, this is the second night in a row
[15729.08s -> 15731.70s]  Oh yeah, no, this is bad
[15731.70s -> 15735.03s]  This is terrible
[15735.03s -> 15737.03s]  Terrible, terrible
[15737.03s -> 15739.91s]  I'm getting like 8 megabits down
[15739.91s -> 15742.34s]  And I have a thousand down
[15742.34s -> 15745.80s]  Literally like an hour ago, this was a thousand
[15745.80s -> 15747.80s]  Oh yeah, this is not good, something's wrong
[15747.80s -> 15750.23s]  I think they're doing maintenance or something
[15750.23s -> 15763.10s]  Your VPN? I don't have a VPN turned on right now
[15763.10s -> 15768.22s]  Facecam react
[15768.22s -> 15774.30s]  It's been the exact same time
[15774.30s -> 15776.30s]  Two days in a row
[15776.30s -> 15781.67s]  I think it looks like it's evening out a little bit
[15781.71s -> 15783.71s]  Sorry about that, it's going to be like that probably till I end
[15790.34s -> 15793.54s]  Alright, dude, come at me
[15797.04s -> 15801.01s]  Lime, well fiber is
[15801.01s -> 15803.25s]  It's fiber
[15803.25s -> 15805.25s]  The way that fiber works, you don't share it
[15805.25s -> 15815.42s]  It's not cable
[15815.42s -> 15819.84s]  So that's why when something like this happens
[15819.84s -> 15821.84s]  It's like they're doing something
[15821.84s -> 15834.64s]  I was on cable, if you remember
[15834.64s -> 15836.64s]  A year or two ago, a couple years ago, I was on cable
[15836.68s -> 15843.14s]  I've been on cable forever
[15843.14s -> 15845.45s]  You still share the line though
[15845.45s -> 15847.45s]  From my understanding, you don't share
[15847.45s -> 15849.45s]  A node with a fiber
[15849.45s -> 15851.45s]  With actual fiber line
[15851.45s -> 15853.45s]  Like a true fiber connection
[15853.45s -> 15855.45s]  Fiber to the house is not
[15855.45s -> 15857.45s]  A shared line with your neighborhood
[15857.45s -> 15871.26s]  Is this still happening?
[15871.26s -> 15878.17s]  Oh, a node
[15878.17s -> 15880.17s]  I'll do karaoke
[15880.17s -> 15882.47s]  Is it good now? Is it better?
[15882.47s -> 15885.16s]  Alright, I'm going to do
[15885.16s -> 15889.51s]  I want to do
[15889.55s -> 15891.55s]  Mahjong, mahjong, mahjong, mahjong
[15891.55s -> 15893.55s]  Mahjong, mahjong, mahjong, mahjong
[15893.55s -> 15895.55s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go
[15895.55s -> 15909.82s]  Let's go
[15909.82s -> 15911.82s]  At Mahjong Jambalaya, you can play at tables
[15911.82s -> 15913.82s]  With varying rates or participate in ranked matches
[15913.82s -> 15916.26s]  The tables are beginning, low, right, intermediate
[15916.26s -> 15918.26s]  High, advanced and high
[15918.26s -> 15920.26s]  The price to play and the strength of the opponents
[15920.26s -> 15922.26s]  Vary depending on the table
[15922.26s -> 15924.26s]  Ooh, alright, let's go
[15924.26s -> 15926.26s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go
[15926.26s -> 15928.82s]  Oh, I don't have any money
[15928.82s -> 15931.12s]  I don't have any money
[15931.16s -> 15936.22s]  Sorry, I don't have any money
[15936.22s -> 15940.38s]  Going to the casino
[15940.38s -> 15942.38s]  Alright, I'm ready to play at the casino
[15942.38s -> 15944.38s]  Okay, sir, what's your bet?
[15944.38s -> 15946.38s]  I don't have any money, I just wanted to come in
[15946.38s -> 15950.02s]  And play
[15950.02s -> 15952.84s]  What's over here? This is Mahjong
[15952.84s -> 15971.02s]  Darts, did you just stop me?
[15971.02s -> 15973.02s]  Don't stop me, I want to go play darts
[15983.69s -> 15985.99s]  What can I get you?
[15985.99s -> 15988.86s]  You can get me
[15988.86s -> 15991.35s]  None of this
[15991.35s -> 15995.45s]  I want to play darts
[15995.49s -> 15997.49s]  I want to play darts
[15997.49s -> 15999.73s]  Wasn't this a dart place?
[15999.73s -> 16001.97s]  Dying again? Fuck
[16001.97s -> 16005.92s]  No
[16005.92s -> 16008.93s]  Shit, it is
[16008.93s -> 16013.09s]  I got to call them
[16013.09s -> 16015.09s]  I got to call it here
[16015.09s -> 16024.50s]  Fuck
[16024.50s -> 16026.50s]  Sorry guys
[16026.50s -> 16028.50s]  I'm going to call the internet company
[16028.50s -> 16030.50s]  It's just not supposed to be happening
[16030.50s -> 16032.50s]  And by the way, this is the
[16032.50s -> 16034.50s]  First problem in like a year
[16034.50s -> 16036.50s]  It's been rock solid
[16036.54s -> 16038.54s]  So, something's going on
[16038.54s -> 16040.71s]  Let me just figure out what it is
[16040.71s -> 16046.54s]  So I'll be back
[16046.54s -> 16049.10s]  Tomorrow
[16049.10s -> 16051.10s]  If I
[16051.10s -> 16053.10s]  Kind of cold gets worse
[16053.10s -> 16055.10s]  I might take tomorrow and just not stream
[16055.10s -> 16058.34s]  Save the game, I will
[16058.34s -> 16060.34s]  I think doing like the voices may have
[16060.34s -> 16063.93s]  Caused a little bit more of a problem
[16063.93s -> 16065.93s]  But I got to call
[16065.93s -> 16067.93s]  And see what's going on, because this is definitely not supposed to be happening
[16067.93s -> 16071.58s]  I had a lot of fun though
[16071.58s -> 16074.07s]  I'm going to play it again
[16074.11s -> 16076.11s]  When I come back, if it's not tomorrow
[16076.11s -> 16078.11s]  Then listen to me
[16078.11s -> 16080.11s]  Okay, when I come back tomorrow, we're going to have so much fun
[16080.11s -> 16082.35s]  If I shouldn't have done so many
[16082.35s -> 16084.35s]  Of those throat things
[16084.35s -> 16087.23s]  Where the sound comes out
[16087.23s -> 16089.23s]  If I'm not live tomorrow, I'll see you guys
[16089.23s -> 16091.66s]  The day after that, which would be
[16091.66s -> 16093.66s]  Saturday
[16093.66s -> 16095.66s]  So, plan on Saturday, I might turn it on tomorrow
[16095.66s -> 16097.66s]  But I'm going to call the internet company right now
[16097.66s -> 16100.29s]  And see what the hell is going on
[16100.29s -> 16102.29s]  But that is going to end this stream
[16102.29s -> 16105.30s]  We'll do Yakuza again
[16105.34s -> 16108.73s]  I like it, I wouldn't stream the game
[16108.73s -> 16113.72s]  Three times in a row if I didn't like it
[16113.72s -> 16116.86s]  I'll see you guys either tomorrow or Saturday
[16116.86s -> 16118.86s]  Have a great rest of your night
[16118.86s -> 16120.86s]  Thanks for watching everybody
[16120.86s -> 16122.86s]  Sorry, we're kind of ending like half hour 45 minutes early
[16122.86s -> 16125.48s]  I didn't want to end right now, but you've got to catch it
[16125.48s -> 16128.04s]  And make sure nothing's going on that I have to fix or something
[16128.04s -> 16130.73s]  I'll see you guys soon
[16130.73s -> 16135.34s]  Let's do the ending credits here
[16135.34s -> 16140.46s]  Here come the subs
[16140.46s -> 16142.46s]  Thanks everybody for subbing as always
[16142.46s -> 16146.04s]  Really appreciate it
[16146.04s -> 16148.04s]  Saving the game, you can even hear it, trust me
[16148.08s -> 16151.33s]  You can hear me saving
[16151.33s -> 16153.33s]  See, I just shoved the guy
[16153.33s -> 16155.33s]  I just pushed the guy like into the street
[16155.33s -> 16160.30s]  Here we go
[16160.30s -> 16172.70s]  Okay
[16172.70s -> 16176.10s]  Alrighty, raid, raid, raid
[16176.10s -> 16178.10s]  Who's streaming, let's see
[16178.10s -> 16186.34s]  Who's live right now
[16186.34s -> 16188.34s]  We have
[16188.34s -> 16193.84s]  Uhhhh
[16193.84s -> 16197.41s]  Alright, we're going to raid Neander's
[16197.41s -> 16201.89s]  Raid Vinny
[16201.89s -> 16203.89s]  Vinny's, what do you mean Vinny
[16203.89s -> 16206.38s]  Vinny's not live
[16206.42s -> 16209.43s]  Hey, I
[16209.43s -> 16216.02s]  I'm a Neanderth supporter
[16216.02s -> 16218.02s]  Yeah, let's go raid Neanderth
[16218.02s -> 16223.53s]  I never catch her live
[16223.53s -> 16229.35s]  Neanderth is a Vtuber
[16229.35s -> 16231.35s]  She's very funny
[16231.35s -> 16234.42s]  Am I a Neanderthal?
[16234.42s -> 16239.03s]  Of course I am
[16239.03s -> 16241.78s]  Look at me
[16241.78s -> 16245.24s]  What's she doing, playing away out
[16245.24s -> 16248.31s]  That'll be interesting
[16248.31s -> 16250.31s]  I'll see you guys later
[16250.31s -> 16252.87s]  I'm going to go drink some hot tea
[16252.87s -> 16254.87s]  Go tell Neanderth I said hello
[16254.91s -> 16258.56s]  You're going to be there in a second
[16258.56s -> 16260.56s]  I'll see you guys later
[16260.56s -> 16264.27s]  Take care, goodbye
[16264.27s -> 16269.70s]  If I don't see you tomorrow, I'll see you Saturday
[16269.70s -> 16271.70s]  Go, go, go, go
[16271.70s -> 16273.70s]  Raid, raid, raid, raid, raid
[16273.70s -> 16276.83s]  Everybody raid
[16276.83s -> 16278.83s]  Raid, raid, raid, raid
[16278.83s -> 16283.63s]  Raid, raid, raid
[16283.63s -> 16285.63s]  Raid, raid, raid
[16285.63s -> 16287.63s]  Get that up to 5k
[16287.63s -> 16289.81s]  Get that up to 5k
[16289.81s -> 16291.81s]  Or I'm not pressing it
[16291.81s -> 16297.25s]  Go, go, go, go
[16297.29s -> 16299.29s]  Get that up to 5k
[16299.29s -> 16303.26s]  People are leaving it
[16303.26s -> 16305.26s]  No, get that shit up to 5k
[16305.26s -> 16308.78s]  We're going with a 5k raid
