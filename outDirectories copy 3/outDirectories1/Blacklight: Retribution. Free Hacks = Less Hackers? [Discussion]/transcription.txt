[0.31s -> 13.63s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Blacklight Retribution.
[13.63s -> 20.63s]  The first Blacklight Retribution video on this channel. Not sure if it's going to be the last or not, but we will see as time goes.
[20.63s -> 28.63s]  I actually just recently installed this game. I didn't really catch on to it when it released a little while ago, but it's very, very fun.
[28.63s -> 33.63s]  This is not a game that I would consider to be the best first-person shooter I've ever played in my life,
[33.63s -> 36.63s]  but it is definitely very, very fun, very, very action-oriented.
[36.63s -> 43.63s]  And if you're noticing on the screen, before I really get into the loadout, because I mean, I'm not really that sure of a lot of the game mechanics,
[43.63s -> 52.43s]  because like I said, I just sort of installed this game not that long ago, and I only really have maybe five hours into the game, maybe total.
[52.43s -> 58.43s]  So I unlocked this gun, and the way that unlockables work in this game, it's actually very, very confusing at first.
[58.43s -> 66.43s]  And again, pretty much how it works is you have to buy either with in-game currency or out-of-game currency, which is actual real money.
[66.43s -> 71.43s]  You have to buy these guns, and they only last for a certain amount of time.
[71.43s -> 76.43s]  I think this gun has one day on it before I can not use it anymore, unless I want to buy more time with it.
[76.43s -> 81.67s]  It's a little confusing. I'm not sure if there's any way you can permanently purchase an item or not,
[81.67s -> 86.23s]  but if you can, then that's something I have not really figured out yet.
[86.23s -> 91.23s]  But what I want to bring up in this game, it's actually a very, very good discussion to have with you guys,
[91.23s -> 95.23s]  it is how to stop hackers from taking over your game.
[95.23s -> 98.23s]  Now this is, I guess I could go in a million different directions with this,
[98.23s -> 104.23s]  but I want to cover on the legal free hacks that every single person gets in this game.
[104.23s -> 108.23s]  It's actually a major, major part of the game mechanic.
[108.23s -> 113.23s]  So if you see right there, I just touched my face and instantly could see through all the walls.
[113.23s -> 116.23s]  It kind of reminds me of, if you ever played Perfect Dark,
[116.23s -> 120.23s]  that gun where you could see everybody's silhouettes through walls and you could shoot through walls,
[120.23s -> 122.23s]  you cannot shoot through walls in this game.
[122.23s -> 124.23s]  But oh, watch this like fail hack right here.
[124.23s -> 126.23s]  I really had no idea what I was even doing.
[126.23s -> 128.23s]  I just was like, just hack, I just do this button, whatever.
[128.23s -> 130.23s]  But that's besides the point there.
[130.23s -> 134.41s]  So legal free hacks, that's the discussion of this video.
[134.41s -> 140.41s]  And when you give it to everybody, what are the consequences of doing this and what does it actually achieve?
[140.41s -> 142.41s]  So let's go from the very beginning here.
[142.41s -> 145.41s]  When a game comes out, there's always going to be hackers.
[145.41s -> 148.41s]  There's always going to be people that get some way to exploit the code.
[148.41s -> 150.41s]  They come up with all kinds of different things where they can,
[150.41s -> 157.41s]  oh, here's like auto aim, here's wall hacks, here's super secret butthead hack, whatever you have for hacks.
[157.41s -> 164.58s]  So a company like this that decides to come up with a game that just includes hacks for everybody,
[164.58s -> 168.58s]  it almost makes it so even if you got a wall hack for this game,
[168.58s -> 171.58s]  it wouldn't even be necessary because you can do that anyways.
[171.58s -> 177.58s]  And I feel like that's a very, very good way to deter anybody from hacking the game to begin with.
[177.58s -> 183.82s]  Because when you hack a game, you're doing it because you're trying to get an advantage on people, an unfair advantage.
[183.82s -> 190.82s]  And that's something that companies since back in like the mid 90s when PC gaming really took off in the first place,
[190.82s -> 193.82s]  they've been trying to combat this for so long.
[193.82s -> 200.13s]  And you could go back to when DRM first came out, the bad DRM, the one where it was like,
[200.13s -> 206.13s]  if you are not connected to the internet at 24-7, then we're going to come to your house and slam your head off your desk.
[206.13s -> 209.13s]  It gets kind of ridiculous, especially when they introduce stuff like that,
[209.13s -> 213.13s]  or you can only install the game in one or two different places.
[213.13s -> 220.13s]  But it's almost necessary now because these companies are so scared of piracy, of hackers,
[220.13s -> 225.13s]  of all these bad things that could plague a game community that they freak out sometimes.
[226.37s -> 232.37s]  Diablo 3 has a constant connection and it's technically a single player game.
[232.37s -> 236.37s]  Now, I mean, we could go off on, I could talk about this for the entire day,
[236.37s -> 240.37s]  but let's get back to Blacklight and how free hacks make no hacks.
[240.37s -> 243.74s]  So let's say you load up Blacklight Retribution.
[243.74s -> 248.74s]  You turn it on, you get your hacks ready, you get auto aim or auto bot or whatever it is, auto bot.
[248.74s -> 251.74s]  That's from the Transformers, right?
[251.74s -> 256.74s]  Well, let's say you like get Optimus Prime or like come down to your house and sit down and like play games with you.
[256.74s -> 258.74s]  No, so let's say you load up your auto aim.
[258.74s -> 262.74s]  You load up Blacklight, you get into a game, get into a lobby and you play the game.
[262.74s -> 268.98s]  Even if you have it enabled and you're killing people with auto aim, people can see you through walls.
[268.98s -> 276.28s]  So you still can't get that 200 and 0 KD game or that 95 and 2 KD game
[276.28s -> 280.28s]  because people can come up behind you that you can't see and will still kill you.
[280.28s -> 284.71s]  Now, this is not to say that nobody will ever hack Blacklight Retribution.
[284.71s -> 289.71s]  No, there's probably people right now in the lobby shooting a million people and killing people with hacks.
[289.71s -> 294.71s]  But the point of this video is to talk about the potential deterrence that this could have to a hacker
[294.71s -> 296.71s]  or to somebody that wants to cheat in the game.
[296.71s -> 301.71s]  And just basically in general that if a game is fun, a game has great mechanics, a game is interesting,
[301.71s -> 305.71s]  it has a great community, not very many people are going to hack it.
[305.71s -> 308.71s]  And it's, I see that a lot in Team Fortress 2.
[308.71s -> 313.71s]  Team Fortress 2 has a very good community behind it and not, you know, you run into a hacker every now and then,
[313.71s -> 318.71s]  but it's pretty rare in the over five years that I've played Team Fortress 2.
[318.71s -> 323.71s]  I really think I've only come across maybe three hackers in the entire time I played the game.
[323.71s -> 330.71s]  Now, translate that to another one of these big titles that is plagued with hackers and you start to see the correlation.
[330.71s -> 336.08s]  Some of these games have huge, massive mainstream audiences,
[336.08s -> 342.08s]  which of course there's more of a pool for hackers and a game like Team Fortress, of course, has a lot less players,
[342.08s -> 344.08s]  but they're much more close-knit.
[344.08s -> 347.08s]  And I think it's all about that guy. It's all about love.
[347.08s -> 351.08s]  It's all about community because if you know the guy next to you, do you want to hack him?
[351.08s -> 356.26s]  I mean, not really. I mean, if you don't know the guy five doors down down the street,
[356.26s -> 359.26s]  do you care if you hack that guy? Probably not.
[359.26s -> 363.26s]  Now, I don't want to get into a discussion where we're talking about which gaming community is the best
[363.26s -> 366.26s]  because every gaming community really has its ups and its downs.
[366.26s -> 368.26s]  So no real community is the best.
[368.26s -> 371.26s]  There are always going to be new ones popping up every now and then,
[371.26s -> 373.26s]  and they're good to be a part of all of them.
[373.26s -> 376.43s]  But I just wanted to make this video to kind of get a discussion going.
[376.43s -> 379.43s]  I'd like to see what you guys have to say, some of your thoughts.
[379.43s -> 382.43s]  If you have any points to make, please, by all means, put it in the comments section.
[382.43s -> 386.43s]  I would love to read them, as would a lot of the other people that are watching this video right now as well.
[386.43s -> 389.43s]  So please let me know what you think.
[389.43s -> 394.43s]  And also, before this video is over, I don't even like talk about how this is free.
[394.43s -> 396.43s]  This game is free to play.
[396.43s -> 400.43s]  You can go download it through Steam right now, which I highly suggest you do.
[400.43s -> 404.43s]  Even if you only play this game for an hour or two, that's you didn't have to pay for it.
[404.43s -> 406.43s]  I mean, what's the worst that could happen?
[406.43s -> 409.43s]  And I always forget about that when it comes to free to play games.
[409.43s -> 413.67s]  Even if you don't like it, you can just uninstall it and pretend like it never happened, right?
[413.67s -> 416.67s]  And I really am feeling like this game is starting to catch on with me.
[416.67s -> 419.67s]  I love the gunplay. I like the mechanics. I like the wall hacks.
[419.67s -> 420.67s]  It's a lot of fun.
[420.67s -> 426.67s]  And I did say in the very beginning that this was not the best FPS I've ever played before, but it is very good.
[426.67s -> 428.98s]  So hopefully you guys check this game out.
[428.98s -> 431.98s]  And with that, that is going to wrap up the video.
[431.98s -> 433.98s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[433.98s -> 436.98s]  And I will see you guys all next time.
[436.98s -> 438.98s]  And take care, everybody.
