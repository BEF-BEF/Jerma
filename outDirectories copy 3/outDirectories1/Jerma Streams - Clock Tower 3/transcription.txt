[1.34s -> 12.71s]  How the heck are you? Hey, you sleeping? Hey, wake up. Hi guys.
[12.71s -> 19.83s]  Oops. Welcome to another stream. Just saw you last night potentially.
[19.83s -> 25.24s]  Or maybe I didn't. Maybe you weren't here yesterday.
[25.24s -> 37.32s]  And in that regard, how are you today? A loud streamer wakes up innocent viewers.
[37.32s -> 42.01s]  Innocent viewers. What about that one time you called me an idiot?
[42.01s -> 49.75s]  Guilty! Now I hope you guys are doing well. We're going to start today.
[49.75s -> 54.82s]  Sort of where we left off yesterday. And that is...
[54.82s -> 65.99s]  I almost puked. What is going on? What's with this fucking like earthquake?
[65.99s -> 82.39s]  Like the choppers closing in? Listen to this. You good?
[82.39s -> 87.94s]  Okay, what is... Is everyone just hovering here?
[87.94s -> 91.91s]  That was a long time. That was almost a full
[91.91s -> 95.77s]  10 to 15 second straight. Longer than that.
[95.77s -> 99.85s]  But no, we're going to play Clock Tower 3. It is a classic PlayStation 2
[99.85s -> 102.39s]  game. I don't know how much of it I'm going to
[102.39s -> 109.32s]  play, but I'm going to give it at least a solid attempt. And then from there
[109.32s -> 115.90s]  we're going to move on to probably 25 to life.
[115.90s -> 122.28s]  I still need to find a place to play this game that requires 12 hours.
[122.28s -> 126.95s]  Maybe we'll do that today too. Should I start? No, I can't start with that
[126.95s -> 134.50s]  one. That game probably sucks ass. I thought Clock Tower 3 was the bad
[134.58s -> 140.84s]  one. Oh, I thought it was the good one. Did I
[140.84s -> 152.20s]  get the bad one? Is Clock Tower 3 the bad one?
[152.20s -> 161.51s]  Three is the bad one. So what's the good one?
[161.51s -> 167.40s]  Two is the bad one. Clock Tower 3 is the good one.
[167.40s -> 173.78s]  He doesn't know. One and two. Three is just weird.
[173.78s -> 177.58s]  It's not scary. Well, good thing I've got
[177.58s -> 182.22s]  a little bit of a list here to play today and tomorrow.
[182.22s -> 187.74s]  And then we're going to close the book on retro for a while.
[187.74s -> 192.06s]  I've said that like so many times. I have so many old games.
[192.06s -> 195.66s]  I keep saying, yeah, we've done like three streams in a row
[195.66s -> 201.26s]  of Dreamcast. Yeah, we're going to close the book a
[201.26s -> 204.30s]  little while and like the old retro stuff and then like a week and a
[204.30s -> 206.70s]  half later I'm playing PlayStation 2 again.
[206.70s -> 213.94s]  I was gonna say Dark Souls, but I don't know why that was going to
[213.94s -> 221.51s]  happen. It's not just the game that's old,
[221.51s -> 224.79s]  but I love it though. I love like playing these old games, especially the old
[224.79s -> 229.13s]  strange, obscure ones that just don't make any sense.
[229.13s -> 235.86s]  It scratches an itch in my brain, so I love it.
[235.86s -> 239.24s]  But we're going to go back to VR after tomorrow.
[239.24s -> 241.56s]  So if you're wondering, wait, when are you going to go back to that VR stuff?
[241.56s -> 246.17s]  I just needed a break from it. VR is going to come back next week.
[246.17s -> 250.55s]  We're going to do Mind Show and then I kind of want to go back to
[250.55s -> 257.88s]  Jet Island and keep playing that, but it
[257.88s -> 265.43s]  should be fun. That should be at some point in the
[265.43s -> 274.82s]  middle or late of next week. No one liked Jet Island? I did.
[274.82s -> 279.96s]  I did. What's your overall opinion on VR so far? I wish I could just play it
[279.96s -> 283.58s]  every day. We would be playing it. I'd be doing
[283.58s -> 289.29s]  it right now. I'd be streaming VR today and yesterday,
[289.29s -> 294.14s]  but I can't do it. My fucking old man brain can't do it.
[294.14s -> 301.40s]  I just want to live in VR. All right, let's get going. I'm going to play
[301.80s -> 313.69s]  the good one. Incoming Clock Tower 3. Let's just have some fun. No, let's just
[313.69s -> 317.38s]  relax. You got to build up a tolerance to it.
[317.38s -> 322.98s]  Yeah, if I do that for more than three, four, five straight days,
[322.98s -> 326.97s]  two days in a row, three days in a row, if I wasn't even streaming it,
[326.97s -> 329.53s]  I would still have to take a break from it for a couple days. I would
[329.53s -> 339.35s]  start getting headaches. It's like wearing glasses for the first time.
[339.35s -> 342.79s]  This game includes disturbing content and scenes of graphic violence. Does
[342.79s -> 346.09s]  it? It's a PlayStation 2, though. It don't
[346.09s -> 348.89s]  count. The graphics aren't good enough for it to be, like, actually a
[348.89s -> 365.62s]  problem. Produced by Capcom. Directed by...
[365.62s -> 419.85s]  I didn't see it. Not seeing. Quiet.
[421.99s -> 425.11s]  It is Mr. X.
[430.92s -> 493.70s]  This is a Capcom game. Mr. X drops a nuke somewhere.
[493.70s -> 502.57s]  Clock Tower 3! All right, make sure we're right here.
[502.57s -> 507.21s]  Only type. I can't type and play the game at the same time.
[507.21s -> 515.35s]  That wouldn't make any sense. This is not the technical screen, too, although I
[515.35s -> 518.71s]  kind of wish it was sometimes. That was so much fun.
[518.71s -> 523.50s]  I'm just in the right spot. This is not correct.
[523.50s -> 539.83s]  Wow, hold on, hold on, hold on. It's pre-recorded. You can type.
[539.83s -> 545.02s]  This is not pre-recorded. I feel like I'm gonna get Phantom of
[545.02s -> 551.06s]  the Opera memed here. No, no, I need that back. Give me that
[551.06s -> 558.94s]  back so I can see what I'm doing. All right, that looks good. A little bit
[558.94s -> 563.99s]  of bars on the sides, but it's cinematic, okay? Well, get those
[563.99s -> 567.83s]  bars off. No, that makes it a 16 by 8.
[567.83s -> 570.31s]  That makes it 15 by 9. You guys, that's
[570.31s -> 585.26s]  cinematic. Is this a movie? I don't know.
[586.22s -> 599.16s]  Dearest Alyssa, how have you been? I think of you every day.
[599.16s -> 603.16s]  It seems such a long time since you started your life at boarding school.
[603.16s -> 606.60s]  It was after your beloved grandfather went missing while traveling three
[606.60s -> 608.84s]  years ago that I sent you away to boarding
[608.84s -> 612.84s]  school and told you not to come back for at least six years
[612.84s -> 617.56s]  without giving you any explanation. It must have been very painful for you
[617.56s -> 621.16s]  and I'm sorry, but it was for your own protection.
[621.24s -> 625.56s]  Now your 15th birthday is approaching and I fear your life may be in danger
[625.56s -> 630.04s]  more than ever before. Please go into hiding until your 15th
[630.04s -> 633.66s]  birthday has passed. I know that what I am saying will make
[633.66s -> 637.66s]  no sense to you, but please do as I tell you and hide as
[637.66s -> 642.73s]  quickly as you can. Your loving mother, Nancy.
[642.73s -> 649.22s]  Mum. Alyssa, you're wanted on the telephone. It's your mother.
[649.30s -> 656.55s]  Hello? Mum? Hello? Are you there? Put on to me. Hello?
[656.55s -> 685.59s]  Am I playing yet? Mum, I'm back. Margeants.
[685.59s -> 692.65s]  What? Are we already starting? All right, I should pay attention and not
[692.65s -> 696.89s]  write like fucking tongue-in-cheek scripts on my video
[696.89s -> 701.22s]  page. By the way, that was the, I think
[701.22s -> 705.32s]  that was the actual garage band default sound you can make for a
[705.32s -> 721.77s]  jumpscare. Does Mr. X talk? Is he a tail?
[721.77s -> 727.86s]  Yes, I am. Oh, I'm Alyssa, Nancy's daughter.
[727.86s -> 733.06s]  Daughter? Do you know where my mother is? Your mother has gone out.
[733.06s -> 737.70s]  That was early yesterday morning. Huh? She mentioned that she would not be
[737.70s -> 742.18s]  coming back for some time. What? She was wrong. She won't be
[742.18s -> 744.98s]  coming back. At all. And he's gonna bring the
[744.98s -> 751.50s]  scissors up and start snapping at me. You are all in this world, little girl.
[751.50s -> 757.18s]  See? Here he comes. My sweet Alyssa. All right, I don't like this. I've been
[757.18s -> 760.38s]  waiting so long for this moment. Get away from me. I don't like this
[760.38s -> 763.74s]  version of Lemony Snickett's A Series of Unfortunate Events.
[763.74s -> 778.23s]  Is that supposed to be, uh, Snood? What's his name? Olaf.
[778.23s -> 784.41s]  Count Snood. All right, let's go. So I just...
[784.41s -> 787.69s]  What the fuck was that? My shadow. I thought the shadow was an alien.
[787.69s -> 793.72s]  What am I supposed to do? The light from the fire casts a reddish glow.
[793.72s -> 801.13s]  Okay. Play Snood or pre-record it. Snood is the original virus game.
[801.13s -> 810.01s]  Don't you guys know? The clock keeps perfect time. And the
[810.01s -> 812.25s]  chair that strange gentleman was sitting in,
[812.25s -> 818.54s]  a terrible smell is emanating. His unwashed smelly body
[818.54s -> 825.78s]  had been sitting there for at least three or four hours.
[825.78s -> 829.30s]  And you find it absolutely revolting that a smell could linger for that
[829.30s -> 837.85s]  long. Okay, so this was a save point. A diary
[837.85s -> 841.05s]  lies open with an incomplete entry. You can save game data here.
[841.05s -> 849.74s]  Sure. Bootleg smelly Mr. X.
[857.26s -> 866.84s]  Just leave and call the police. Something wrong? One minute and 20
[866.84s -> 870.20s]  seconds. Guest wing first floor. All right.
[870.20s -> 874.55s]  Yeah, I'm just gonna leave. There's no need to go out now. I have to
[874.55s -> 878.97s]  find Mum. All right, let's go find Mum. This
[878.97s -> 881.61s]  is bright. A strange pattern adorns the jar.
[881.61s -> 890.52s]  It is brimming with fresh water. Okay. Do I have any other menu? Okay, is
[890.52s -> 892.04s]  there a menu or something I can look at?
[892.04s -> 897.35s]  There's a map. So it looks like I can go
[897.35s -> 903.24s]  through. Okay, let's go there. Mr. X is just Sir Topham Hatt.
[903.24s -> 915.05s]  Go this way. Nothing of interest here. You don't want to open the door?
[915.05s -> 919.21s]  Do I hide in this game? I have to hide from Mr. X, right?
[919.21s -> 923.42s]  It's filled with art and antiques. Grandfather used to collect that kind of
[923.42s -> 931.00s]  thing. This is Capcom, so those of you saying
[931.00s -> 935.32s]  that this is a copy of Resident Evil, you mean you're probably right, but they
[935.32s -> 940.28s]  made the other one too. All guest rooms from this point forward.
[940.28s -> 943.78s]  Everyone's out. It's locked. All guest rooms from this
[943.78s -> 952.09s]  point forth. Everyone's out. Okay. Grandfather's room. He's not here now.
[952.09s -> 956.49s]  It's been three years since he left. When is he coming back?
[956.49s -> 962.57s]  Ooh, I don't know if he's gonna come back.
[962.57s -> 969.24s]  I don't know how to tell you that. He left.
[969.24s -> 974.02s]  He took off three years ago. No one decided to tell her.
[974.02s -> 982.62s]  All right, upstairs now. Let's check this one. Let me look at the map.
[982.62s -> 986.65s]  I need to have complete map knowledge. Where am I standing?
[986.65s -> 994.55s]  Right there. So we're gonna go into the corner here. All right, this one
[994.55s -> 1000.15s]  has a spell on it.
[1002.31s -> 1006.55s]  Okay, so it turns the lights off. That's a pretty weird place for a
[1006.55s -> 1013.53s]  light switch. The panic meter. Whenever Alyssa is
[1013.53s -> 1017.93s]  feeling physically or emotionally threatened, the panic meter rises.
[1017.93s -> 1022.09s]  When the panic meter reaches max, Alyssa falls into a state of panic.
[1022.09s -> 1025.77s]  While in a state of panic, Alyssa's movements are restricted
[1025.77s -> 1029.29s]  and if attacked while in a state of panic, she will die.
[1029.29s -> 1033.13s]  The panic meter reading will go down slowly if Alyssa
[1033.13s -> 1037.29s]  relaxes in a safe place. Always keep an eye on the panic meter
[1037.29s -> 1040.98s]  and try to minimize stress whenever possible.
[1040.98s -> 1045.78s]  All right, so we have to manage a panic meter.
[1045.78s -> 1049.54s]  Or you could call it the P meter. For short, we could
[1049.54s -> 1056.62s]  simplify that as the Peter. Sounds good.
[1056.62s -> 1071.66s]  So don't touch that. First jump scare of the game. Fire!
[1071.66s -> 1077.62s]  That's really bad. You found it, Django.
[1077.62s -> 1084.58s]  All right, let's see what it is. The wall behind the fireplace is falling apart.
[1084.58s -> 1088.44s]  Who would have thought there was a hidden room in there? We'll get in
[1088.44s -> 1095.43s]  there. Oh well, circle is crouch apparently.
[1095.43s -> 1103.29s]  Do I get any weapons or anything? No, the whole point of clock tower is you're
[1103.29s -> 1113.40s]  just walking. Okay, grandpa had a weird graphic imagery. That's graphic.
[1113.40s -> 1124.52s]  See? What's that? Let me see. That looks like a bottle and a letter down
[1124.52s -> 1131.61s]  there. It's a bottle of sacred bottle
[1131.61s -> 1136.55s]  and a letter. Let's read the letter in a good accent here.
[1136.55s -> 1140.94s]  Nancy's letter. No, I'm not going to do that again.
[1140.94s -> 1144.86s]  Dearest Alyssa, I wanted nothing more than for you to live
[1144.86s -> 1149.40s]  peacefully, but if you are reading this now you must have come back to the
[1149.40s -> 1153.46s]  house. For your protection, I am giving you
[1153.46s -> 1156.18s]  some advice, as well as instructions on how to use
[1156.18s -> 1160.02s]  this bottle of holy water. How to use it. If you ever are
[1160.02s -> 1163.78s]  threatened, sprinkle some holy water on your asylum. It will cause them to
[1163.78s -> 1168.34s]  halt temporarily. And to break the soup. No, I'm gonna,
[1168.34s -> 1171.54s]  I have to fucking take this knowledge in because I'm gonna read. People get
[1171.54s -> 1175.86s]  mad when I play games like this and I act like a dickhead and I don't
[1175.86s -> 1179.14s]  pay attention to what this says. Because right now I'm not paying any
[1179.14s -> 1183.80s]  attention at all to what this says. I'm just reading it. Here we go.
[1183.80s -> 1188.04s]  Exorcism. If you ever are threatened, sprinkles, if you ever are threatened,
[1188.04s -> 1191.72s]  sprinkle some holy water on your assailant. It will cause them to halt
[1191.72s -> 1200.06s]  temporarily. So splash holy water like that.
[1200.06s -> 1205.10s]  Okay. Destroying sigils. To break the seals that prevent access to certain
[1205.10s -> 1210.04s]  places, sprinkle holy water on them. So those
[1210.04s -> 1213.16s]  seals, I sprinkle holy water. I'm paying attention.
[1213.16s -> 1221.88s]  I'm paying attention. See? So sprinkle, sprinkle.
[1221.88s -> 1226.12s]  Replenishing holy water. Always remember that the holy water you
[1226.12s -> 1230.12s]  have is not in limitless supply. You can refill your bottle from either
[1230.12s -> 1234.84s]  sacred jars or from lion drinking fountains.
[1234.84s -> 1239.40s]  Sacred jars or lion drinking fountains. So the jars, the jar.
[1239.40s -> 1247.16s]  Okay, my mouth. I gotta like, yeah, so those jars.
[1247.16s -> 1250.60s]  Sentimental items and spirits. A person who has died of unnatural causes
[1250.60s -> 1253.16s]  has unfinished business in the living world.
[1253.16s -> 1256.84s]  In order to protect yourself, you must work to heal their wounds. To do
[1256.84s -> 1264.26s]  so, you must find their sentimental item. Lastly, this is all my fault,
[1264.26s -> 1267.70s]  but I will do my best to protect you. Please remember that I love you more
[1267.70s -> 1273.10s]  than anything else in the world and I always will. So I have to find
[1273.10s -> 1276.22s]  sentimental items to let the spirits go free.
[1276.22s -> 1280.22s]  Replenish the holy water from jars and drinking fountains.
[1280.22s -> 1284.30s]  Sigils can be destroyed with the holy water sprinkle
[1284.30s -> 1288.70s]  and the bad guy that chases you in the game can be temporarily stopped
[1288.70s -> 1294.58s]  with the sprinkle of the holy water. I'm reading. See?
[1294.58s -> 1298.36s]  I'm trying. I'm turning over a new leaf in 2019.
[1298.36s -> 1302.20s]  It's paying attention to tutorial messages and really focusing.
[1302.20s -> 1308.22s]  I'm not gonna do any buff accents. It's the
[1308.22s -> 1313.21s]  patron saint of the Hamilton house. I can't even do it now.
[1313.21s -> 1318.42s]  What is it doing in here though? But the like the fucking dumb shit comedy
[1318.42s -> 1321.38s]  part of my brain is just fighting me inside my head right. There's a battle
[1321.38s -> 1326.97s]  going on. I'm gonna save the game. All right,
[1326.97s -> 1331.29s]  so I got the bottle of holy water. Is it mapped already? How do I use it?
[1331.29s -> 1335.59s]  Three? So I have three uses of it. How do I use it though?
[1335.59s -> 1346.55s]  How do I stand up? Circle? Let me go to the controls first.
[1346.55s -> 1353.21s]  Items, files, key items, options. Let's just look.
[1353.21s -> 1356.65s]  This is back when games didn't have tutorials. The tutorial for games back
[1356.65s -> 1361.13s]  like 20 years ago, they had instructional booklets that
[1361.13s -> 1364.49s]  you read before you put the disk in. All right, search is
[1364.49s -> 1370.65s]  x, duck is circle, walk is square, attack is triangle. That's very
[1370.65s -> 1373.53s]  important. No vibration because it'll just ruin
[1373.53s -> 1384.23s]  everything. Look, it always does. Special arrow is r1. Well, it's triangle.
[1384.23s -> 1387.19s]  You read the booklets on the way back from the game story. Yeah, don't you
[1387.19s -> 1390.14s]  guys wish that it was like that still?
[1390.14s -> 1394.06s]  They should have a timer when you download a video game. This should be
[1394.06s -> 1396.22s]  you open it up and there's a 30 minute timer
[1396.30s -> 1400.70s]  and it gives you a little book to read about how the game works.
[1400.70s -> 1404.86s]  And the game doesn't physically unlock until 30 minutes after you open it.
[1404.86s -> 1415.10s]  All right, so I can open this now with the holy water.
[1415.10s -> 1425.56s]  So let's try it. Did it work? Yep. I need to save the game. Is there
[1425.56s -> 1430.76s]  is there a safe point going to be in here?
[1430.76s -> 1433.80s]  Let's just go save it because I know this is one of those games where
[1433.80s -> 1439.88s]  I have to save it constantly. There's gonna be monsters, there's
[1439.88s -> 1446.90s]  gonna be aliens and shit. Save the game after all that hard
[1446.90s -> 1455.26s]  work. The game looks cool. Yeah, I thought you guys said this was
[1455.26s -> 1460.58s]  the bad one. I did my research. I did my research on
[1460.58s -> 1463.78s]  which one was the best one, aka which one was the cheapest and
[1463.78s -> 1473.83s]  currently available for me to buy. I did a lot of research on it. I have
[1473.83s -> 1476.47s]  a question though. If I refill this here, does it get
[1476.47s -> 1478.63s]  rid of this? Should I not refill this till I have
[1478.63s -> 1484.62s]  zero? He didn't read the manual for 30 minutes.
[1484.62s -> 1492.70s]  The cheapest one. I'm just kidding. This wasn't the cheapest one. I did
[1492.70s -> 1497.19s]  save. Refill the holy water. Yeah, I did just
[1497.19s -> 1500.86s]  save it. Let's see if it disappears. No, okay good. So I can refill it
[1500.86s -> 1507.35s]  whenever I want there. Who reads anymore? Now that's the
[1507.35s -> 1512.38s]  problem with this generation is nobody's reading books anymore.
[1512.38s -> 1516.54s]  You know what I'm saying? Like, that's a problem. People aren't reading anymore.
[1516.54s -> 1529.64s]  You should be reading a book a week. It's actually
[1529.64s -> 1533.08s]  it's offensive to me that people are not reading at least one to two books
[1533.16s -> 1536.92s]  a week. All right, can I get rid of this one?
[1536.92s -> 1554.38s]  I just got a sigil on it. Name one book you've read this year.
[1554.38s -> 1560.89s]  It's 2019. Look, this is what I do.
[1560.89s -> 1567.00s]  So yeah, we have to read one book per week, right, is what I just said.
[1567.00s -> 1570.60s]  That's fine. What I do is I wait till the end of the year
[1570.60s -> 1574.20s]  and then the last like six weeks of the year I read a book every day.
[1574.20s -> 1577.72s]  So it still counts. This is Nancy's room.
[1577.72s -> 1588.73s]  Well, hold on, that's not, wait a minute. I did read how to
[1588.73s -> 1592.63s]  reinstall the filter in my air purifier. That was
[1592.63s -> 1595.51s]  actually really long. It was probably like 15 pages
[1595.51s -> 1598.47s]  of how to like do maintenance and care on my humidifier.
[1598.47s -> 1611.43s]  Is that me moment up? Archie comics don't count as a book. Yes they do.
[1611.43s -> 1615.46s]  I read all of the Attack on Titan manga.
[1615.46s -> 1624.52s]  I'll prove it to you. You gotta read it right to left. Huh?
[1624.52s -> 1637.26s]  I told you that I did that. I know you told me not to but I couldn't
[1637.34s -> 1645.75s]  help it. I'm so worried about you. Where are you?
[1645.75s -> 1653.77s]  Those pillows suck. Those are pillows you'd find as a
[1653.77s -> 1657.77s]  throw pillow on a dirty couch. That's what you sleep on?
[1657.77s -> 1667.94s]  Is that Mum? Did he replace himself in all the family photos?
[1667.94s -> 1676.79s]  Who's playing the piano? Who's playing that?
[1676.79s -> 1683.35s]  Where's the sound coming from? Who's doing that?
[1683.35s -> 1687.18s]  You should have stabbed the photo. You had an opportunity. This is the way to
[1687.18s -> 1689.74s]  kill him. This is his heart right here and you had a chance and that's what
[1689.74s -> 1691.26s]  we're gonna find out at the very end of the game.
[1691.26s -> 1695.72s]  You could have just stabbed the book and blood will come out of that book
[1695.72s -> 1710.49s]  and you kill him. More shit like that in movies. I'm so
[1710.49s -> 1713.21s]  sick of like the doll that comes to life.
[1713.21s -> 1717.05s]  I'm so sick of like that we got lost in the woods. No no no. Where's
[1717.05s -> 1720.73s]  the book that is the heart or that is the
[1720.73s -> 1723.37s]  monster? And the book is just a spell book.
[1723.37s -> 1727.06s]  It's like Merlin's fucking tomb. You know what I mean?
[1727.06s -> 1730.42s]  And the family is so terrified of all this shit going on in the house.
[1730.42s -> 1733.46s]  It could be werewolves. They could be fucking Loch Ness monsters. It could be
[1733.46s -> 1736.18s]  aliens like crashing down into the house and like killing people and eating
[1736.18s -> 1738.50s]  people. But it's the book that's doing it. It's
[1738.50s -> 1741.38s]  the Merlin's fucking magic tomb that's on their bookshelf and they
[1741.38s -> 1743.38s]  didn't even realize it and they flip through at the end of the movie
[1743.38s -> 1746.42s]  and it's every page is all the fucked up shit that's been going on
[1746.42s -> 1749.72s]  in the house. And they fucking stab through the book and like the book
[1749.72s -> 1756.42s]  bleeds and that's the end of the movie.
[1756.42s -> 1763.88s]  Door's sealed. That's literally happened. That happened in Goosebumps.
[1763.88s -> 1771.93s]  Well make it. Okay was that just a Goosebumps book?
[1771.93s -> 1790.31s]  For that? These mo-capped explosion jumps.
[1790.31s -> 1793.75s]  Actor in a studio with like a bunch of wires off.
[1793.75s -> 1813.35s]  This is way too expensive for us to not know what the hell's happening.
[1813.35s -> 1817.94s]  She's desperately trying to find the piano. Each key on the piano is a
[1817.94s -> 1821.14s]  different monster on it and like he's... I'm sorry never mind.
[1821.14s -> 1838.54s]  So where am I supposed to go? I thought this was Clock Tower 3.
[1838.54s -> 1842.87s]  This dude's flying in flight in a bumblebee.
[1842.87s -> 1848.49s]  Something's holding the door. What's it gonna be? A monster in here?
[1852.49s -> 1877.00s]  Elsa. Uh-oh. Monster sequence. I'm ready. Oh shit.
[1877.00s -> 1889.29s]  Oh shit. That was a great reaction. The ring. Give me back my ring.
[1889.61s -> 1894.58s]  Here comes the piano. Can I get the ring? Ring. What about it? Is it in here?
[1898.12s -> 1901.19s]  Okay. Engagement ring. I got a ring.
[1904.92s -> 1909.69s]  Spiritual healing. When you find a sentimental item
[1909.69s -> 1913.05s]  that belongs to a person who died of unnatural causes, return it to its
[1913.05s -> 1917.53s]  rightful owner. If it is a ring, put it in its case. If it's a half heart pendant,
[1917.53s -> 1920.49s]  put it together with the other half by returning the sentimental item. Spirits are
[1920.49s -> 1924.89s]  healed and Elissa may obtain another item or value the information in return.
[1924.97s -> 1926.65s]  When you find a sentimental...
[1929.77s -> 1931.93s]  Some people are getting probably very angry at this.
[1933.62s -> 1935.54s]  Let me just like swirl around my fucking whiskey.
[1940.36s -> 1943.64s]  When you find a sentimental item that belongs to a person who died of
[1943.64s -> 1952.70s]  unnatural causes, return it to its rightful owner. If it's a ring, put it in its case.
[1953.58s -> 1957.18s]  If it is a half heart pendant, put it together with the other half.
[1958.84s -> 1961.80s]  By returning these sentimental items, spirits are healed
[1962.36s -> 1965.88s]  and Elissa may obtain another item or valuable information in return.
[1967.24s -> 1969.96s]  Put the ring in the box. Put the pendant together.
[1970.92s -> 1978.41s]  You got it. The box is literally right here.
[1979.05s -> 1986.86s]  How do I put the ring in the box? I kind of have to get you a...
[1986.86s -> 1991.98s]  Should I throw holy water at this lady? Put the ring in the box.
[1994.28s -> 1996.44s]  An empty ring box. Did someone steal the ring from him?
[2001.82s -> 2005.82s]  Do I actually have to select it?
[2006.38s -> 2020.15s]  What's inventory? Does it start? Okay, do I actually have to use it?
[2020.87s -> 2021.75s]  Drop it. Okay.
[2028.06s -> 2031.42s]  Yeah, I know what you're gonna do. Use item, yes.
[2035.18s -> 2038.94s]  My ring! You found my ring! Thank you.
[2043.70s -> 2047.77s]  Here, I left you some humanity. Thanks, hacker.
[2049.08s -> 2058.63s]  Sigil stone. Sigil stone. Let's get some info on that.
[2060.95s -> 2063.59s]  We'll take an attack on your behalf once.
[2064.79s -> 2067.80s]  So it's just... it's just a shield.
[2068.60s -> 2073.51s]  So it's an armor. It's one armor.
[2074.71s -> 2077.82s]  Oh, I can refill this. Good thing I paid attention.
[2079.02s -> 2085.91s]  Uh, it's a very fun... You can save and refill. That's cool.
[2087.19s -> 2102.55s]  How the hell do you do that on a piano?
[2103.59s -> 2108.76s]  How could you be that fast? Listen to this guy.
[2109.40s -> 2116.74s]  How the fuck can you even do that shit?
[2117.70s -> 2125.48s]  If you don't play the piano, well...
[2126.44s -> 2130.92s]  Seriously, that's... that's a skill. That's an incredible skill.
[2131.56s -> 2148.30s]  Congress? What's that? I can hear a piano. Is it coming from Congress?
[2149.34s -> 2158.71s]  Jerma, do the invisible guitar joke. Ha ha ha.
[2162.39s -> 2165.27s]  He starts... he starts and stops playing.
[2165.27s -> 2166.95s]  It's almost like he forgets how to play the song
[2166.95s -> 2169.75s]  and then he just goes completely wild and knows exactly...
[2169.75s -> 2173.98s]  See? Wait, is it this key? Yeah, I know, I got it again.
[2189.43s -> 2193.27s]  Stop playing this game to force another joke?
[2193.83s -> 2196.39s]  Wait, you want me to like put another PlayStation game in?
[2196.39s -> 2197.59s]  No, I want to play this game.
[2200.90s -> 2211.90s]  What? You want me to like... you want to put in like a...
[2212.78s -> 2217.19s]  You want to put in like fucking Stuntman and then reach for content?
[2217.75s -> 2219.88s]  What's wrong with this?
[2220.52s -> 2237.38s]  No, we're doing this for a little while. I'm playing this for a while.
[2237.38s -> 2248.46s]  All right, I gotta find a ring.
[2254.52s -> 2256.44s]  You're constantly stopping to make jokes.
[2256.44s -> 2257.80s]  Do you know what stream you're on?
[2262.38s -> 2265.10s]  I'm pretty sure that's what we do every time we play a game.
[2265.82s -> 2280.20s]  All right, I guess I got a pen. Is this this lady's pen?
[2280.20s -> 2283.10s]  Looks like you shoved it up your ass.
[2283.10s -> 2296.63s]  I thought this guy was a serious gamer.
[2297.35s -> 2300.87s]  All right, but that's not a... just a gold fountain pen.
[2300.87s -> 2310.84s]  Okay, it's covered in blood stains of victim's belongings.
[2310.84s -> 2314.28s]  The entry begins, my darling must be addressed to her fiance.
[2316.44s -> 2317.96s]  Did you pen come out of here?
[2326.09s -> 2330.73s]  All right, return pen.
[2331.53s -> 2333.21s]  That means I get one of those shards, right?
[2333.21s -> 2334.33s]  Invisibility band.
[2335.45s -> 2337.37s]  All right, this game's starting to get really, really bad.
[2339.14s -> 2340.58s]  It's like not fun.
[2340.58s -> 2342.90s]  And I should go force a joke on another game.
[2343.62s -> 2346.02s]  Ring worn for temporary invisibility.
[2346.74s -> 2352.90s]  No, I'm just kidding. I fucking think this is fun.
[2356.30s -> 2357.50s]  Hey, you can just relax.
[2358.06s -> 2362.55s]  What else is over here?
[2368.74s -> 2370.82s]  Do another Scottish accent.
[2375.19s -> 2377.19s]  No, what is with you guys lately?
[2377.19s -> 2379.27s]  This is like the guy yesterday that said,
[2379.27s -> 2381.67s]  all right, you can't take a break for a day
[2381.67s -> 2383.67s]  and then come back and play Ed, Ed and Eddie.
[2388.49s -> 2390.09s]  You have to dare you take a day off
[2390.09s -> 2391.45s]  and then play Ed, Ed and Eddie.
[2399.56s -> 2400.60s]  He was right.
[2408.01s -> 2409.69s]  All right, I made it into a new house.
[2417.10s -> 2418.62s]  Lavender water, what's the difference?
[2425.42s -> 2428.78s]  Cordial distilled from beautiful purple flower alleviates panic.
[2428.78s -> 2432.90s]  Okay, make some smell nice.
[2433.54s -> 2437.46s]  There's gonna be something in here scary.
[2444.65s -> 2447.82s]  This is a letter from dad.
[2447.82s -> 2448.70s]  Here comes a joke.
[2453.06s -> 2453.70s]  How are you?
[2453.70s -> 2456.82s]  I'm now in France in a region known as Champagne.
[2456.82s -> 2462.02s]  Ooh, that is a beautiful place with vineyards as far as the eye can see.
[2462.90s -> 2465.94s]  When the war is over, we must come here together for a holiday.
[2466.82s -> 2470.26s]  I hear that they have organized for blackouts in London now.
[2470.90s -> 2475.38s]  I'm sure that you are fine during the day as Jane is there.
[2476.10s -> 2478.66s]  But I worry about your being alone at night.
[2479.30s -> 2481.22s]  You'll be all right, won't you, darling?
[2482.28s -> 2483.16s]  Keep warm.
[2483.16s -> 2485.24s]  With love, Orson.
[2485.88s -> 2487.99s]  Did I miss something?
[2488.55s -> 2501.50s]  No, that was a classic reference.
[2501.50s -> 2502.30s]  Classic joke.
[2503.93s -> 2505.29s]  That's a huge telephone.
[2506.01s -> 2507.69s]  It's way too big for anybody to hold.
[2508.41s -> 2510.73s]  All right, that's just you because you're a short streamer.
[2511.29s -> 2526.98s]  Good evening, sir.
[2526.98s -> 2528.26s]  This is my first stream.
[2528.26s -> 2529.78s]  I want serious gameplay.
[2532.63s -> 2534.55s]  I'm sorry that you probably won't get that here.
[2544.20s -> 2545.32s]  Bring back Orson.
[2545.32s -> 2546.52s]  Bring back Orson.
[2546.52s -> 2548.04s]  Bring back Orson.
[2548.04s -> 2553.96s]  The desk is clean and well organized.
[2554.04s -> 2559.02s]  That just depends on who's got control of the controller today.
[2559.02s -> 2559.58s]  You know what I mean?
[2561.03s -> 2563.13s]  Some days, you get me.
[2563.85s -> 2565.93s]  Other days, you get a guy that beats Jebel first try.
[2567.80s -> 2569.88s]  I don't know who you're going to be talking to.
[2570.60s -> 2574.84s]  Remember that movie with Professor X, the young Professor X?
[2574.84s -> 2575.64s]  It's kind of like that.
[2576.20s -> 2577.58s]  Whatever his name is.
[2577.58s -> 2580.74s]  This must be the owner of the house.
[2580.74s -> 2581.30s]  There's a key.
[2588.46s -> 2589.50s]  There's a key next to it.
[2589.50s -> 2590.06s]  Yes, there is.
[2593.38s -> 2594.66s]  Red draw key.
[2596.44s -> 2599.72s]  There's probably a red draw in this building.
[2605.18s -> 2605.74s]  Fireplace.
[2606.38s -> 2609.18s]  The poker is still stuck in the pile of firewood.
[2609.18s -> 2610.54s]  Somebody must have just been here.
[2614.78s -> 2615.98s]  These records look quite old.
[2619.74s -> 2623.69s]  I wonder how many people screamed at that one.
[2624.25s -> 2628.84s]  That wouldn't even go.
[2628.84s -> 2629.80s]  That was just a rat.
[2630.60s -> 2631.96s]  There's some mouse in here.
[2631.96s -> 2632.52s]  Or a snake.
[2632.52s -> 2633.24s]  It could be a snake.
[2634.63s -> 2637.59s]  More than enough books on the classics here.
[2637.59s -> 2638.71s]  We've got Jermacraft.
[2639.27s -> 2641.03s]  We've got Otto's Big Adventure.
[2642.17s -> 2643.21s]  We've got Orson Welles.
[2644.70s -> 2645.90s]  Oh, the classics in there.
[2650.17s -> 2651.37s]  I want more water though.
[2656.50s -> 2657.38s]  Rat movie.
[2658.25s -> 2659.77s]  I'm looking for a red draw.
[2659.77s -> 2661.19s]  Is the one down here?
[2667.58s -> 2667.82s]  No.
[2671.43s -> 2673.03s]  Why am I so interested in this game?
[2673.03s -> 2673.75s]  I just am.
[2677.61s -> 2678.89s]  Lock from the other side.
[2678.89s -> 2679.13s]  Shit.
[2679.85s -> 2681.59s]  On the other side, the key's not going to work.
[2689.45s -> 2690.65s]  Will it just use it automatically?
[2691.37s -> 2692.25s]  No, it's for a draw.
[2696.57s -> 2698.09s]  Have you ever played any good games?
[2698.09s -> 2700.01s]  I played super hot VR like three days ago.
[2700.57s -> 2702.07s]  It was great.
[2702.94s -> 2703.74s]  Beat it on stream too.
[2708.34s -> 2709.70s]  That's a really slow inventory.
[2711.72s -> 2712.52s]  Red draw.
[2713.32s -> 2713.64s]  Red draw.
[2713.64s -> 2714.20s]  Do we go in here?
[2724.09s -> 2724.81s]  He said good.
[2725.61s -> 2727.29s]  Is that a red draw?
[2727.29s -> 2728.17s]  The desk is clean.
[2728.17s -> 2729.29s]  No, we were already in here.
[2729.29s -> 2730.49s]  There's no red draw.
[2731.53s -> 2732.33s]  Red draw.
[2732.33s -> 2733.53s]  Okay, now you dropped it again.
[2733.53s -> 2734.89s]  Like you were going to get me again somehow.
[2737.27s -> 2738.23s]  Let me look at the map.
[2738.23s -> 2740.49s]  Is this some...
[2740.49s -> 2741.45s]  Okay, I haven't been over here.
[2742.01s -> 2744.81s]  What do you mean?
[2744.81s -> 2745.77s]  What am I saying wrong?
[2750.86s -> 2754.94s]  Unimaginative ghost puts jumpscare back in same place.
[2757.26s -> 2760.84s]  That is pretty funny.
[2760.84s -> 2762.63s]  This way, okay.
[2765.61s -> 2766.57s]  Red draw.
[2768.70s -> 2769.42s]  Blood.
[2769.42s -> 2770.89s]  There's blood everywhere.
[2771.69s -> 2772.34s]  It's locked.
[2772.34s -> 2773.06s]  I'm gonna let it open.
[2773.86s -> 2779.96s]  I only have one.
[2782.20s -> 2782.60s]  There it is.
[2785.29s -> 2785.93s]  Drawer.
[2787.78s -> 2790.20s]  Yeah, but you gotta remember,
[2790.20s -> 2792.84s]  I have the remnants of a Boston accent.
[2793.56s -> 2801.22s]  I still say like car, car, car, draw, drawer.
[2801.78s -> 2804.44s]  What are you guys on about?
[2804.44s -> 2805.32s]  Christmas tragedy.
[2805.32s -> 2806.92s]  Young pianist brutally murdered.
[2807.80s -> 2808.89s]  Christmas day.
[2810.17s -> 2813.61s]  Mae Norton was found murdered in Norton's The Taylor.
[2814.25s -> 2818.38s]  She was discovered by Norton family member Jane Stride.
[2819.18s -> 2821.99s]  Returned home to find the victim unconscious.
[2822.71s -> 2825.91s]  An autopsy revealed that it was an instantaneous death
[2825.91s -> 2828.23s]  caused by a blow to the skull with a heavy blunt object.
[2828.23s -> 2829.35s]  No suspects have been named.
[2830.15s -> 2834.23s]  The victim had taken part in the 15th Annual Piano Concord
[2834.95s -> 2837.67s]  at the Victoria Hall in Kensington the previous day.
[2838.31s -> 2840.95s]  A consummate pianist, Miss Norton,
[2840.95s -> 2842.71s]  was widely tipped for first prize.
[2843.59s -> 2845.11s]  But an unfortunate error in her performance
[2845.11s -> 2846.71s]  prevented her from taking the crown.
[2847.59s -> 2849.75s]  May have been living at home alone since her father,
[2849.75s -> 2850.95s]  William Norton, serving officer,
[2850.95s -> 2853.03s]  returned to the front in July.
[2854.47s -> 2854.71s]  Okay.
[2855.75s -> 2860.89s]  It's pianist.
[2865.80s -> 2866.84s]  Something going on upstairs.
[2868.92s -> 2871.85s]  What the hell is going on up here?
[2874.33s -> 2874.57s]  What?
[2875.21s -> 2876.09s]  Where was this happening?
[2878.82s -> 2879.30s]  What?
[2879.30s -> 2880.90s]  Why did I miss this upstairs?
[2883.14s -> 2884.02s]  What the fuck?
[2894.60s -> 2896.28s]  Oh my fucking god.
[2896.28s -> 2897.32s]  That's insanity.
[2899.72s -> 2900.76s]  Are you serious?
[2904.22s -> 2905.58s]  I don't have a save point.
[2905.58s -> 2906.22s]  What do I have to do?
[2907.96s -> 2910.12s]  Evade points and hide points.
[2910.12s -> 2915.03s]  When Alyssa is fleeing from an enemy,
[2915.03s -> 2917.51s]  certain predetermined areas may start to glow.
[2917.51s -> 2919.91s]  These are evade points and hide points.
[2920.87s -> 2922.63s]  Approach the area and press the search button
[2922.63s -> 2924.39s]  to make Alyssa take evasive action
[2924.39s -> 2925.83s]  and repel her attacker.
[2927.59s -> 2929.43s]  Most evade points can only be used once.
[2933.93s -> 2936.17s]  Press the search button when in front of a hide point
[2936.17s -> 2937.69s]  and Alyssa can take refuge there.
[2938.41s -> 2940.49s]  The camera will switch to a first-person view
[2940.49s -> 2941.21s]  while in hiding.
[2942.89s -> 2945.77s]  Hide points can usually be used repeatedly.
[2945.77s -> 2948.01s]  But if the panic meter reaches max while in hiding,
[2948.01s -> 2950.25s]  Alyssa will run out from her hiding place.
[2951.21s -> 2952.81s]  Always keep an eye on the panic meter.
[2953.61s -> 2955.45s]  Because evade points and hide points,
[2956.49s -> 2958.33s]  and they glow and you have to hit X on them.
[2958.33s -> 2958.81s]  Well, let's go.
[2958.81s -> 2959.21s]  Whatever.
[2959.21s -> 2959.45s]  Hold on.
[2959.45s -> 2962.49s]  First of all, let's open this first.
[2962.49s -> 2963.21s]  There's something in here.
[2964.41s -> 2967.16s]  It is Maze Room Key.
[2972.09s -> 2972.41s]  Man.
[2978.33s -> 2978.57s]  What?
[2979.21s -> 2980.17s]  I can't open this.
[2981.93s -> 2983.64s]  He's seeing off my name?
[2984.52s -> 2987.53s]  Can I get some evade points?
[2989.19s -> 2989.51s]  Oh!
[2997.53s -> 3000.39s]  It's too slow.
[3000.39s -> 3001.27s]  It's happening too slow.
[3001.27s -> 3001.75s]  Where does he go?
[3002.47s -> 3003.59s]  I have Maze Key.
[3003.59s -> 3004.95s]  I have Maze Room Key.
[3004.95s -> 3010.10s]  What are you doing?
[3015.86s -> 3016.18s]  Hide?
[3016.90s -> 3017.70s]  I can't get in there?
[3018.68s -> 3019.64s]  How can I not get in there?
[3020.76s -> 3021.96s]  Maybe I can scare you now.
[3024.46s -> 3025.10s]  Fire poker.
[3025.10s -> 3025.90s]  Fire poker in the head.
[3035.21s -> 3036.17s]  Sorry, ghost.
[3036.17s -> 3037.85s]  There's something way scarier here.
[3037.85s -> 3038.33s]  What do I do?
[3038.97s -> 3039.77s]  I gotta get out of here now.
[3039.77s -> 3040.33s]  How do I get out?
[3041.05s -> 3044.25s]  Anything else I can do?
[3044.25s -> 3045.37s]  He's gonna get up, right?
[3045.37s -> 3046.33s]  These records look old.
[3046.33s -> 3046.65s]  No, no, no.
[3046.65s -> 3047.69s]  Get out of the room.
[3047.69s -> 3048.65s]  Can I do anything else?
[3049.45s -> 3053.35s]  Go, go, go.
[3053.35s -> 3053.91s]  Out, out, out.
[3058.76s -> 3059.80s]  Smash his head with a hammer.
[3059.80s -> 3060.36s]  That's what I would do.
[3061.08s -> 3062.62s]  If that was me,
[3062.62s -> 3064.62s]  I would smash that guy's head with a sludge hammer.
[3066.30s -> 3067.18s]  Like a watermelon.
[3069.45s -> 3070.33s]  And then I would just like,
[3070.33s -> 3071.69s]  I would burn him.
[3071.69s -> 3073.13s]  I would drag him to the fire.
[3076.73s -> 3078.70s]  Where's this?
[3078.70s -> 3079.82s]  And I would sit there and watch
[3079.82s -> 3080.86s]  and just make sure it was gone.
[3084.30s -> 3084.94s]  Psycho?
[3084.94s -> 3085.26s]  M?
[3085.26s -> 3085.82s]  Oh, really?
[3085.82s -> 3087.10s]  The guy chasing you with a sludge hammer
[3087.10s -> 3088.78s]  that just killed like a little girl?
[3090.04s -> 3090.60s]  Are you sure?
[3091.67s -> 3092.79s]  I'm the psycho?
[3092.79s -> 3096.54s]  The key to Maze Room on the second floor.
[3096.54s -> 3097.66s]  I need to get up there.
[3097.66s -> 3103.90s]  I can't just leave.
[3104.46s -> 3106.70s]  There's a locked door on the second floor.
[3107.26s -> 3112.39s]  I've seen every horror movie in the book.
[3116.09s -> 3117.69s]  Okay, after that guy's burnt,
[3117.69s -> 3120.62s]  you put his ashes in a box
[3120.62s -> 3123.18s]  and like mail it to the fucking store,
[3123.18s -> 3124.54s]  like North Pole or something.
[3129.91s -> 3131.11s]  And then you pay a guy.
[3131.75s -> 3135.99s]  You pay a guy like 25 grand to eat the ashes.
[3135.99s -> 3141.14s]  And you want like a private YouTube link
[3141.14s -> 3142.18s]  of the guy doing it.
[3142.18s -> 3145.66s]  Just so you know.
[3146.70s -> 3152.66s]  Because it's a diary.
[3158.52s -> 3160.84s]  But then the guy that eats the ashes becomes the guy.
[3173.42s -> 3176.46s]  Today I darn daddy sucks and sewed a button on his shirt.
[3176.46s -> 3177.74s]  He calls himself a tailor,
[3177.90s -> 3179.26s]  but he can't even mend his own clothes.
[3179.26s -> 3180.46s]  Please dad, I'm not your wife.
[3181.58s -> 3183.58s]  A few more days until the button
[3183.58s -> 3185.02s]  I still can't play perfectly.
[3185.02s -> 3185.58s]  What am I gonna do?
[3187.10s -> 3187.98s]  I thought this was a game
[3187.98s -> 3190.22s]  where a guy in a tower chases you with scissors.
[3191.10s -> 3199.05s]  That's the first game.
[3199.05s -> 3201.85s]  Yeah, we played the first game for like 10 minutes.
[3201.85s -> 3203.35s]  It was an invitation.
[3206.30s -> 3210.33s]  Uh oh.
[3210.33s -> 3211.85s]  I told you we should have burnt him.
[3212.57s -> 3214.41s]  I told you we should have smashed his head
[3214.41s -> 3216.41s]  like an egg and burnt his body.
[3216.41s -> 3220.46s]  What did I tell you?
[3222.78s -> 3224.31s]  Hit him with a chair in the head.
[3224.95s -> 3225.51s]  Oh my god.
[3227.03s -> 3231.42s]  What are you doing?
[3231.42s -> 3236.34s]  In the head.
[3237.30s -> 3244.38s]  Okay, this guy is really, really not that strong.
[3245.66s -> 3246.86s]  Like that was pretty big.
[3246.86s -> 3247.66s]  Come on man, really.
[3261.13s -> 3262.87s]  That was bad.
[3262.87s -> 3265.43s]  He did a really cool Star Wars block the bullet.
[3265.43s -> 3267.43s]  He hit the chair with a sledgehammer.
[3267.43s -> 3272.86s]  But then that's like getting one of those in a game
[3272.86s -> 3274.14s]  where you're doing really well
[3274.14s -> 3275.50s]  and you do something fucking awesome.
[3275.50s -> 3279.91s]  Like you headshot a guy from across the whole map
[3279.91s -> 3282.63s]  in Apex Legends, right?
[3282.63s -> 3284.31s]  So you're playing Apex Legends
[3284.31s -> 3286.39s]  and you're across the map and you snipe some guy
[3286.39s -> 3289.11s]  and it's fucking like put it on the front page of every Reddit
[3289.67s -> 3292.23s]  and then you like fall off the cliff and die.
[3292.79s -> 3298.76s]  That's what happens.
[3298.76s -> 3299.85s]  That's what that was.
[3304.38s -> 3307.51s]  All right, I need to get out of here.
[3307.51s -> 3308.55s]  Can I go?
[3311.38s -> 3312.58s]  All right, that's not even a sledgehammer.
[3312.58s -> 3313.46s]  That's a broom.
[3314.02s -> 3315.64s]  This guy sucks.
[3318.74s -> 3320.18s]  Hi, idiot.
[3320.18s -> 3326.47s]  Use holy water on him?
[3326.47s -> 3327.88s]  That's not a bad idea.
[3327.88s -> 3330.73s]  No, it's just a guy.
[3330.73s -> 3332.33s]  This is just a weird guy.
[3333.13s -> 3341.51s]  All right, I have the invitation to the piano hall.
[3341.51s -> 3344.46s]  I need to save the game.
[3344.46s -> 3351.16s]  Where's there a save point around here?
[3351.16s -> 3352.12s]  Somewhere outside maybe?
[3352.68s -> 3354.82s]  Is there no save point in this house?
[3371.10s -> 3371.34s]  What?
[3372.54s -> 3376.14s]  He's serious.
[3377.02s -> 3378.46s]  I need to get down there.
[3379.90s -> 3381.90s]  Oh, dude, this is this is stuff.
[3381.90s -> 3384.14s]  This reminds me of Apex Legends.
[3384.14s -> 3386.78s]  When you like when you shoot the guy from across the map
[3387.90s -> 3389.66s]  and then you squat up and you land somewhere
[3390.30s -> 3395.05s]  and then like some guy comes out of nowhere and like kills you.
[3396.86s -> 3398.22s]  I actually don't want to die here.
[3413.26s -> 3414.54s]  This guy sucks.
[3416.20s -> 3418.04s]  He really isn't even scary.
[3418.04s -> 3419.08s]  He just sucks.
[3421.94s -> 3422.44s]  Where am I?
[3424.58s -> 3425.14s]  What?
[3425.14s -> 3433.98s]  He teleported.
[3433.98s -> 3435.18s]  Why did he teleport away?
[3435.90s -> 3437.42s]  Oh, here comes the piano again.
[3438.62s -> 3442.38s]  I can refill, right?
[3443.18s -> 3445.30s]  I can't refill my water here?
[3451.27s -> 3451.75s]  Dynamite?
[3452.87s -> 3458.26s]  You're the one playing the piano.
[3467.66s -> 3468.22s]  Lissa!
[3470.71s -> 3471.27s]  Lissa!
[3471.99s -> 3473.83s]  That's how it reminds me of it.
[3473.83s -> 3478.15s]  You know when you're fucking and having a fun time with your friends in Apex Legends
[3478.15s -> 3480.55s]  and somebody over the mic is just like talking shit
[3480.55s -> 3481.91s]  and they make a funny voice.
[3481.91s -> 3482.63s]  It's so funny.
[3483.59s -> 3503.54s]  I'm gonna have to learn how to play the piano.
[3503.54s -> 3504.02s]  Watch this.
[3504.58s -> 3506.47s]  What's that?
[3506.47s -> 3507.43s]  Oh, a diary.
[3507.43s -> 3507.99s]  Save the game.
[3507.99s -> 3508.23s]  Yep.
[3508.95s -> 3514.66s]  What am I doing the next Apex Legends stream?
[3532.79s -> 3533.43s]  Bunker S.
[3536.57s -> 3539.21s]  This is a stream sponsored by Respawn Legends.
[3539.21s -> 3540.25s]  Apex Entertainment.
[3540.89s -> 3548.07s]  It looks fun.
[3548.07s -> 3548.39s]  It does.
[3549.03s -> 3552.22s]  It looks like a fun game.
[3552.94s -> 3558.47s]  I need some more holy water.
[3558.47s -> 3561.19s]  It stopped.
[3562.71s -> 3563.43s]  Wait, is this it?
[3564.31s -> 3565.67s]  I don't have any holy water here.
[3568.44s -> 3570.04s]  Did she stop because I'm in the hall?
[3570.04s -> 3570.76s]  The concert hall?
[3580.14s -> 3580.54s]  Jesus.
[3581.18s -> 3583.86s]  Do I have to play this piano?
[3588.04s -> 3590.44s]  The mocap really is the best part of this whole thing.
[3591.16s -> 3593.85s]  Just the over actor in front of the screen.
[3595.66s -> 3597.50s]  Oh my god, noob just gave 10 community subs.
[3597.50s -> 3601.40s]  Thank you, oh my god, noob.
[3601.40s -> 3602.60s]  Is it us she's looking at?
[3602.60s -> 3603.10s]  Oh.
[3609.91s -> 3616.25s]  Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[3625.56s -> 3627.32s]  Oh, she's missing the- I get it, right?
[3628.76s -> 3634.10s]  Well, maybe if you cleaned off the-
[3639.11s -> 3640.47s]  I know why you can't play the piano
[3640.47s -> 3642.31s]  because it's covered in fucking red liquid.
[3643.11s -> 3643.75s]  Wipe it off.
[3643.75s -> 3646.15s]  Get some Lysol wipes and wipe the damn thing.
[3654.47s -> 3655.59s]  Okay, I couldn't move.
[3660.73s -> 3661.69s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[3663.62s -> 3664.74s]  Do I have to play the piano?
[3665.62s -> 3666.90s]  The piano is dripping with blood.
[3666.90s -> 3667.40s]  No.
[3669.67s -> 3670.39s]  God damn it.
[3671.51s -> 3673.83s]  Oh, I'm too pa- I have- I can't control the game.
[3674.55s -> 3679.69s]  I need a special key.
[3681.53s -> 3686.98s]  What are you doing?
[3690.02s -> 3691.06s]  I can't move.
[3691.06s -> 3692.42s]  I'm panicking.
[3692.42s -> 3693.54s]  I look at this run.
[3695.11s -> 3696.79s]  I look like a bird.
[3696.79s -> 3699.75s]  This is what a bird does right before it panic takes off.
[3701.69s -> 3702.19s]  Move!
[3717.51s -> 3718.23s]  What does that say?
[3718.23s -> 3718.95s]  It's right out here.
[3722.14s -> 3723.58s]  There's a seagull on the beach.
[3725.38s -> 3726.50s]  Use the essential oil.
[3732.63s -> 3734.15s]  It's the Chad stride.
[3734.15s -> 3735.19s]  The panic Chad.
[3735.83s -> 3737.11s]  That's pretty cool.
[3737.11s -> 3738.04s]  Hold on.
[3739.14s -> 3741.14s]  I could drink that, but I got hit.
[3741.14s -> 3741.86s]  That's why it happened.
[3745.77s -> 3748.95s]  What's the goal here?
[3748.95s -> 3750.07s]  Do I even have a goal?
[3752.47s -> 3753.51s]  Wait, hold on.
[3753.51s -> 3754.95s]  Let me look what else is down here
[3754.95s -> 3756.31s]  because I don't even have a goal right now.
[3756.31s -> 3758.55s]  It's just run away from guy in the piano place.
[3759.51s -> 3760.95s]  What is this?
[3761.83s -> 3763.66s]  Some more lavender water.
[3764.22s -> 3767.96s]  Let me just see.
[3767.96s -> 3769.08s]  Okay, this wraps around.
[3769.72s -> 3771.32s]  So I take him out there and run around.
[3772.20s -> 3773.90s]  That's the only door I can go in.
[3774.54s -> 3783.83s]  Derm, what's your favorite meme?
[3783.83s -> 3785.51s]  Oh, definitely the Naruto mirror run.
[3786.63s -> 3790.47s]  Now we're gonna have to do this again.
[3798.44s -> 3799.32s]  Yeah, dude, mine too.
[3802.65s -> 3803.77s]  Basic streamer.
[3803.77s -> 3804.25s]  Come on.
[3804.25s -> 3805.37s]  I'm just kidding around.
[3805.37s -> 3806.57s]  You know what my favorite meme is.
[3807.61s -> 3814.65s]  He does a panic special move.
[3815.29s -> 3827.02s]  How do I go from here?
[3827.02s -> 3828.22s]  I don't have any other direction.
[3828.94s -> 3832.94s]  I need a key now.
[3832.94s -> 3833.58s]  Oh, God.
[3835.66s -> 3836.78s]  See, that's the panic move.
[3841.06s -> 3842.47s]  I'm right in front of you.
[3845.75s -> 3849.13s]  They could have made this guy so much better
[3849.13s -> 3849.77s]  if he was like.
[3852.01s -> 3865.96s]  Oh, what's this do?
[3865.96s -> 3869.00s]  This lever must raise and lower the stage device.
[3869.00s -> 3871.99s]  Yes, I'm gonna crash a head.
[3872.63s -> 3873.51s]  I'm gonna crush his head.
[3876.78s -> 3881.46s]  That is spawn another enemy.
[3885.69s -> 3892.01s]  Sounds like I'm a mannequin.
[3892.01s -> 3911.51s]  Don't itch your hair.
[3911.51s -> 3911.99s]  It looks fine.
[3911.99s -> 3912.47s]  Don't do that.
[3913.35s -> 3918.49s]  He just dropped a bunch of quarters.
[3919.37s -> 3920.01s]  Oh, shit.
[3920.89s -> 3922.33s]  That was for my laundry.
[3923.21s -> 3923.53s]  Fuck.
[3924.25s -> 3927.26s]  I win.
[3931.86s -> 3932.90s]  The torso has been crushed.
[3932.90s -> 3934.10s]  What a horrible death.
[3934.10s -> 3934.98s]  He's holding something.
[3935.78s -> 3939.74s]  I know it's scribbled on a tiny piece of paper.
[3940.46s -> 3942.06s]  Safe combination equals bad.
[3944.62s -> 3947.34s]  1014 is babe, 3403 is dead.
[3949.75s -> 3949.99s]  Bad.
[3950.79s -> 3951.11s]  Babe.
[3951.99s -> 3959.56s]  So I need to do 103, right?
[3960.36s -> 3963.05s]  103.
[3965.80s -> 3966.65s]  I got it.
[3969.24s -> 3970.84s]  Where's the safe that they're talking about though?
[3975.22s -> 3976.26s]  Bad because babe.
[3976.26s -> 3977.06s]  Bad because bad.
[3977.78s -> 3980.57s]  Why is that even a puzzle?
[3980.57s -> 3981.13s]  I don't know.
[3982.01s -> 3982.81s]  Strangely enough.
[3983.69s -> 3986.82s]  The piano is drippings with goo.
[3987.62s -> 3995.03s]  First person to get what that reference is to.
[3995.83s -> 3998.52s]  I will give you pretend $100.
[3998.52s -> 3999.48s]  A pretend like.
[3999.48s -> 3999.88s]  Oh, yeah.
[3999.88s -> 4000.52s]  Whoa, what the heck?
[4005.30s -> 4006.02s]  Like, not real.
[4006.02s -> 4006.66s]  Like, pretend.
[4007.22s -> 4016.23s]  Like, I put my hand out and it's like, I pretend to give you my.
[4018.17s -> 4018.67s]  Uh-oh.
[4018.97s -> 4019.93s]  You're mine now.
[4027.10s -> 4029.34s]  I should have guess kept moving, shouldn't I?
[4031.48s -> 4033.80s]  No, he's regenerating.
[4033.80s -> 4035.24s]  He must have taken a nap out there.
[4035.24s -> 4035.80s]  What the hell?
[4036.60s -> 4042.23s]  All right, I need a safe.
[4050.79s -> 4051.29s]  Duck.
[4052.50s -> 4053.30s]  Duck.
[4053.30s -> 4071.24s]  He doesn't know.
[4073.24s -> 4074.12s]  He doesn't know.
[4083.62s -> 4084.12s]  Fuck.
[4084.60s -> 4087.37s]  That was pretty boss.
[4102.03s -> 4103.47s]  He doesn't know.
[4103.47s -> 4106.11s]  Yeah, let's all like fucking laugh about that guy.
[4106.75s -> 4112.01s]  He can't hear us.
[4112.01s -> 4113.53s]  He's wearing AirPods.
[4117.34s -> 4118.54s]  Yeah, don't tell him.
[4118.54s -> 4119.74s]  Don't tell him.
[4119.74s -> 4120.46s]  Don't tell him.
[4121.18s -> 4123.53s]  So he just opened this door.
[4125.34s -> 4126.62s]  Why can he open this door?
[4131.28s -> 4133.04s]  And where's I'm trapped in here.
[4133.04s -> 4133.76s]  I need a safe.
[4135.63s -> 4136.67s]  He has the key then.
[4136.67s -> 4140.83s]  So I need to I get to crush his head like a goddamn watermelon.
[4143.10s -> 4143.98s]  Slow down.
[4143.98s -> 4145.02s]  Slow down.
[4145.02s -> 4146.81s]  What an asshole.
[4157.26s -> 4158.06s]  They're all off limits.
[4158.06s -> 4158.86s]  I can't open any of this door.
[4158.86s -> 4161.26s]  Is it maybe in the concert hall itself?
[4168.35s -> 4168.91s]  Was it in?
[4169.79s -> 4170.75s]  He's going to get peace back.
[4170.75s -> 4171.31s]  He's back in.
[4172.19s -> 4173.15s]  No, he was just in there.
[4174.11s -> 4179.98s]  This is a safe.
[4182.30s -> 4183.50s]  Oh, this is a safe right here.
[4184.46s -> 4192.37s]  Okay.
[4225.15s -> 4227.23s]  Cloak room lockers with combination locks.
[4227.23s -> 4228.51s]  That memo might be helpful.
[4229.55s -> 4230.43s]  103.
[4231.23s -> 4236.41s]  Thank you.
[4240.84s -> 4241.64s]  Master key.
[4241.64s -> 4243.00s]  Now I can go back in there.
[4243.88s -> 4246.28s]  But oh, let's save it first though.
[4251.21s -> 4253.21s]  Don't like I don't want to get soft locked.
[4253.21s -> 4255.21s]  He like breaks in the door the second I press this.
[4259.26s -> 4259.98s]  I can leave.
[4259.98s -> 4263.50s]  Yeah, but there's a door in the concert hall that I want to open.
[4266.96s -> 4268.48s]  German stocks are in.
[4268.48s -> 4269.28s]  Go buy.
[4269.28s -> 4269.78s]  Are they?
[4276.54s -> 4277.26s]  Really?
[4277.26s -> 4279.16s]  I think he's in this room.
[4279.72s -> 4286.94s]  He's actually just in here, isn't he?
[4292.54s -> 4293.18s]  Special key.
[4293.18s -> 4293.98s]  Use the master key.
[4293.98s -> 4295.50s]  Yeah, this is why I wanted to come here.
[4308.25s -> 4308.75s]  Wait.
[4316.11s -> 4317.07s]  Well, this is too.
[4317.07s -> 4319.55s]  I can go scary way or I can go not scary way.
[4319.55s -> 4320.67s]  Oh, I don't like that angle.
[4328.64s -> 4330.40s]  It doesn't seem to be anything strange here.
[4330.96s -> 4332.57s]  But there is a glowy in the corner.
[4335.05s -> 4336.41s]  Lavender water.
[4336.41s -> 4336.91s]  Nice.
[4337.69s -> 4340.28s]  Anything else in this room?
[4340.92s -> 4345.85s]  Don't even think about doing it.
[4346.41s -> 4348.96s]  Yeah, I know you can speed by.
[4348.96s -> 4350.48s]  Don't even think about it.
[4351.28s -> 4355.72s]  It's taunting me.
[4355.72s -> 4360.32s]  The hell am I?
[4367.87s -> 4369.87s]  Some sort of stage device has been lowered.
[4369.87s -> 4371.55s]  I can't get through if it's not raced.
[4371.55s -> 4372.83s]  God damn it.
[4372.83s -> 4376.86s]  I have to go down and press that button again.
[4381.98s -> 4383.34s]  There's something sitting right there.
[4388.08s -> 4389.68s]  Joop sightings more frequent.
[4389.68s -> 4391.12s]  We got storm signs.
[4391.68s -> 4393.79s]  It's just a candle.
[4394.35s -> 4396.44s]  I don't know what the heck that could be.
[4396.44s -> 4398.28s]  It could be something that I need.
[4398.28s -> 4398.60s]  I don't know.
[4398.60s -> 4403.53s]  It's one of those survival horror video games from the 90s.
[4404.25s -> 4407.21s]  I'm just going to come out 90s.
[4407.93s -> 4413.32s]  When Chad is bored, they spend Jupiter.
[4413.96s -> 4416.60s]  I'm glad they can find a good use of their time.
[4417.88s -> 4421.07s]  Hey, what you should be doing is when you get bored
[4421.07s -> 4422.75s]  and you don't get bored with the game,
[4424.40s -> 4429.20s]  open up a tab and get some physicist shit.
[4430.00s -> 4431.52s]  Do like physicist 101.
[4436.49s -> 4436.81s]  Hold on.
[4436.81s -> 4437.69s]  Let me check what's over here.
[4438.49s -> 4447.69s]  Why have I not created a space agency?
[4448.49s -> 4450.25s]  What the heck were you talking about, man?
[4451.45s -> 4451.77s]  Get up.
[4454.92s -> 4455.32s]  Panic?
[4455.96s -> 4457.16s]  Don't think so.
[4457.16s -> 4458.60s]  I'm going to be drinking one of these.
[4467.07s -> 4468.59s]  Isn't that supposed to alleviate panic?
[4469.31s -> 4470.35s]  Did I miss something here?
[4470.91s -> 4477.76s]  Why is he faster than me on the stairs?
[4478.56s -> 4481.05s]  Oh, where am I going?
[4481.05s -> 4481.61s]  Oh, great.
[4481.61s -> 4483.29s]  A dead end with lockers.
[4483.29s -> 4483.69s]  Wait a minute.
[4484.57s -> 4487.93s]  Wait, no, no, no.
[4487.93s -> 4488.41s]  I thought...
[4488.41s -> 4488.81s]  Okay, wait.
[4488.81s -> 4489.29s]  Hold on.
[4489.29s -> 4489.79s]  No.
[4491.45s -> 4494.62s]  Does he know I'm in here?
[4495.42s -> 4499.45s]  We'll try a different place.
[4500.89s -> 4519.21s]  That's not a way to go.
[4519.21s -> 4520.09s]  This is though, right?
[4520.97s -> 4521.69s]  That's great.
[4529.87s -> 4532.41s]  Try attacking?
[4532.41s -> 4533.21s]  I don't have...
[4533.21s -> 4533.93s]  I don't have anything.
[4533.93s -> 4542.20s]  I have an empty bottle of like liquor in my safe spot.
[4543.24s -> 4559.76s]  It works every time.
[4560.16s -> 4575.16s]  Are you kidding me?
[4575.16s -> 4576.04s]  I almost choked.
[4576.04s -> 4576.36s]  Hold on.
[4576.36s -> 4576.84s]  I spilled.
[4577.88s -> 4579.08s]  I was taking a sip.
[4582.36s -> 4582.76s]  Hold on.
[4583.56s -> 4593.68s]  It's all right.
[4593.68s -> 4594.40s]  It's not that bad.
[4598.33s -> 4599.45s]  It's just a little coffee.
[4600.41s -> 4603.80s]  Thank you for that cool original spill joke.
[4604.60s -> 4605.32s]  I didn't...
[4605.32s -> 4606.28s]  I didn't buy it.
[4618.78s -> 4624.41s]  This time I'm going to start...
[4624.41s -> 4628.41s]  I'm going to know that I just raised the thing.
[4628.41s -> 4632.09s]  I hate this fucking bird chat run so much.
[4640.84s -> 4641.32s]  Really?
[4641.32s -> 4642.12s]  Come on.
[4642.12s -> 4653.55s]  Why is he not seeing me?
[4654.51s -> 4657.87s]  Can I raise this when he's on it maybe?
[4657.87s -> 4659.07s]  Maybe I can like fuck him up.
[4659.07s -> 4659.63s]  Do it.
[4659.63s -> 4660.43s]  Press the button.
[4661.07s -> 4661.79s]  Press the button.
[4663.79s -> 4681.53s]  He has no idea.
[4681.53s -> 4682.81s]  This is the same spot for real.
[4683.61s -> 4688.32s]  I don't want to just die though and restart.
[4689.84s -> 4694.32s]  Because I just have to raise that and go upstairs again.
[4696.00s -> 4696.56s]  All right, he's gone.
[4696.56s -> 4699.77s]  He's gone, right?
[4699.77s -> 4700.17s]  Yep, okay.
[4701.05s -> 4704.59s]  I used my magic item though.
[4706.25s -> 4709.13s]  I used like the Frodo chainmail thing.
[4709.13s -> 4711.37s]  You only get to use that once for a plot device in a movie.
[4711.37s -> 4712.17s]  I don't have another one.
[4712.81s -> 4730.65s]  Half-Life 2 game sounds.
[4731.29s -> 4733.69s]  Just cross the bridge.
[4734.65s -> 4740.16s]  Get out of here and continue your let's play of Clock Tower 3.
[4747.48s -> 4752.04s]  He's going to show up again here.
[4754.11s -> 4754.91s]  He has to, right?
[4755.55s -> 4763.96s]  The lantern is not lit.
[4764.52s -> 4768.14s]  Told you I was going to need that fucking candle.
[4769.55s -> 4770.19s]  I told you.
[4774.41s -> 4776.09s]  Everybody was like it's just a candle.
[4781.85s -> 4783.45s]  It's just a candle, dummy.
[4784.25s -> 4785.45s]  It's not just a candle.
[4786.49s -> 4796.16s]  It's too dark to cross.
[4796.96s -> 4801.76s]  Where's the other candle?
[4806.24s -> 4807.44s]  I can't pick that up.
[4808.32s -> 4808.64s]  Why?
[4828.01s -> 4830.75s]  Do you get why we said this is a bad game?
[4831.71s -> 4833.55s]  Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[4836.43s -> 4846.49s]  This way?
[4846.97s -> 4847.53s]  I didn't know.
[4847.53s -> 4855.21s]  Am I right behind the counter?
[4855.21s -> 4856.57s]  That didn't work last time.
[4857.37s -> 4867.48s]  Can I just leave?
[4868.36s -> 4870.08s]  I have the key, right?
[4871.28s -> 4875.92s]  I can just leave and go out the front door.
[4876.64s -> 4882.70s]  I'm trying to find elaborate ways to get out of here.
[4888.80s -> 4898.01s]  Oh god, it's a fountain.
[4898.01s -> 4899.29s]  It's not a holy water fountain.
[4900.33s -> 4908.78s]  Candle or something out here?
[4909.74s -> 4910.70s]  Is there a light out here?
[4911.82s -> 4912.22s]  Candle?
[4913.10s -> 4913.98s]  A light source?
[4914.86s -> 4916.06s]  A way to light the way?
[4917.02s -> 4930.35s]  Don't panic, please.
[4930.35s -> 4931.87s]  Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.
[4932.67s -> 4934.84s]  Out, out, out, out.
[4934.84s -> 4935.40s]  Leave me alone.
[4936.20s -> 4937.32s]  Leave me alone.
[4938.36s -> 4939.16s]  Get away from me.
[4940.12s -> 4940.60s]  No.
[4942.20s -> 4950.76s]  Stop panicking.
[4951.40s -> 4952.20s]  Stop.
[4952.76s -> 4953.24s]  Why?
[4955.24s -> 4966.09s]  Okay, I don't, I don't want to soft lock myself.
[4966.09s -> 4969.13s]  Where the, why the fuck am I supposed to go?
[4970.57s -> 4973.71s]  Not that way either.
[4975.07s -> 4981.31s]  People.
[4985.82s -> 4987.66s]  You use the water and the water doesn't work, does it?
[4988.70s -> 4993.52s]  I'm actually glad that happened.
[4993.52s -> 4994.96s]  You know why I'm glad that happened?
[4994.96s -> 4998.48s]  Because going up stairs was a waste of time
[4998.48s -> 5000.32s]  and I used a couple of items for no reason.
[5001.36s -> 5004.16s]  So I'm just gonna walk out the front goddamn door.
[5004.72s -> 5011.74s]  This is right before I raised the thing.
[5011.74s -> 5012.22s]  No, it's not.
[5012.94s -> 5016.80s]  It auto saved.
[5023.76s -> 5028.96s]  It was a sigil,
[5028.96s -> 5030.72s]  there was a sigil on one of the doors, wasn't there?
[5031.44s -> 5035.95s]  Just trying to lose them.
[5036.99s -> 5039.47s]  I'm trying to find like a good place where I can like lose them out here.
[5040.43s -> 5051.02s]  Give me some holy water.
[5058.91s -> 5060.75s]  Holy water is about to be achieved.
[5060.75s -> 5061.07s]  Got it.
[5063.39s -> 5064.99s]  Let's just save it here anyways.
[5071.74s -> 5072.78s]  Zero, zero, zero.
[5073.74s -> 5074.92s]  Oh, there it is.
[5075.64s -> 5079.48s]  I'm gonna go YouTube the ending
[5079.48s -> 5081.64s]  because Jerma's never going to beat this game.
[5086.75s -> 5088.43s]  Am I nice to expect it to?
[5089.07s -> 5089.95s]  All right, holy water.
[5090.51s -> 5090.99s]  Where is he?
[5092.51s -> 5093.72s]  Where is he?
[5093.72s -> 5096.20s]  He lost me.
[5096.84s -> 5111.60s]  Up here there's a door, there's a sigil on one of the doors.
[5113.44s -> 5114.76s]  He's already back.
[5117.32s -> 5135.15s]  It'd be impossible for him to know that I was here.
[5136.59s -> 5147.47s]  There's no way he would know I was here.
[5153.52s -> 5155.04s]  Now he's sniffing the air.
[5155.04s -> 5155.76s]  God damn it.
[5155.76s -> 5157.60s]  I'm like a pie on a windowsill.
[5158.16s -> 5160.16s]  No, don't come in here.
[5160.88s -> 5176.20s]  Let's get a save point with two dashes of holy water.
[5182.11s -> 5185.15s]  So now it was upstairs, not...
[5186.51s -> 5189.66s]  It was back where the lockers were.
[5190.62s -> 5192.00s]  I forgot how to get there.
[5201.39s -> 5202.43s]  So it was up here.
[5209.29s -> 5210.65s]  What the fuck are you guys doing?
[5216.70s -> 5217.26s]  Other side.
[5220.01s -> 5224.72s]  Are you playing the piano again?
[5225.28s -> 5226.60s]  Are you back?
[5226.60s -> 5229.13s]  Hey, can we talk?
[5229.13s -> 5231.37s]  She's playing the piano so earnestly.
[5231.37s -> 5232.57s]  What is she trying to express?
[5234.51s -> 5240.43s]  Good thing I have one still.
[5241.15s -> 5242.89s]  That's scary.
[5243.45s -> 5245.93s]  Of course I'm gonna throw holy water at the scary thing of the piano.
[5247.74s -> 5249.74s]  I didn't know if she was gonna like turn and jump scare me
[5249.74s -> 5251.42s]  or try to eat me or bite me or something.
[5251.42s -> 5251.74s]  I don't know.
[5264.36s -> 5265.16s]  God damn it.
[5265.16s -> 5265.96s]  Where is he?
[5265.96s -> 5267.71s]  You're mine.
[5267.71s -> 5270.03s]  Really could have used that second splash of holy water.
[5270.03s -> 5270.75s]  Couldn't you, Jeremy?
[5271.39s -> 5273.63s]  Instead of throwing it at the little ghost girl.
[5274.43s -> 5290.24s]  Where is it?
[5290.24s -> 5291.36s]  Where's the door?
[5292.72s -> 5293.20s]  Right there?
[5299.15s -> 5299.47s]  Go!
[5299.47s -> 5300.35s]  Get in the door!
[5300.35s -> 5301.07s]  Get in the door!
[5301.07s -> 5301.79s]  What are you doing?
[5303.64s -> 5304.20s]  Oh yeah.
[5305.32s -> 5312.70s]  Okay.
[5312.70s -> 5320.27s]  This is the stadium seating.
[5320.91s -> 5323.29s]  These are the less expensive seats.
[5327.02s -> 5327.82s]  Check all the corners.
[5327.82s -> 5328.78s]  Okay, there's a door here.
[5329.42s -> 5332.12s]  I don't know what this is gonna lead to.
[5332.76s -> 5336.70s]  It's locked from the other side.
[5337.50s -> 5339.96s]  We need a light source.
[5340.60s -> 5342.54s]  This is just open.
[5343.80s -> 5344.84s]  This is pretty disheveled.
[5345.48s -> 5348.17s]  I wonder who invented this instrument anyway.
[5349.79s -> 5350.27s]  The harp?
[5353.02s -> 5353.50s]  I don't know.
[5354.14s -> 5357.82s]  The harp is a really kind of fucked up item, isn't it?
[5359.66s -> 5359.90s]  Map.
[5359.90s -> 5360.78s]  There we go.
[5360.78s -> 5361.18s]  Matches.
[5361.98s -> 5366.46s]  The harp is like a gigantic underwater guitar.
[5369.60s -> 5372.72s]  It's huge and strange and looks like it belongs
[5373.12s -> 5374.00s]  like a Disney movie.
[5378.40s -> 5379.28s]  Sounds beautiful though.
[5379.28s -> 5380.56s]  It's a beautiful instrument.
[5380.56s -> 5385.34s]  All right.
[5385.34s -> 5386.30s]  I got what I needed.
[5386.30s -> 5389.60s]  The nut's down here.
[5394.33s -> 5399.48s]  How am I gonna beat rid of this guy?
[5401.16s -> 5402.92s]  Is he gonna give me a chance out of the cutscene?
[5403.56s -> 5405.48s]  I gotta drink that laughing potion right now
[5405.48s -> 5407.40s]  before I go into a panic drink.
[5409.44s -> 5409.84s]  Okay.
[5409.84s -> 5410.56s]  Hold on here.
[5413.12s -> 5418.75s]  It's a high quality bait right there.
[5420.19s -> 5422.03s]  Can I go underneath this?
[5422.51s -> 5425.31s]  Oh my god.
[5425.31s -> 5426.19s]  Thank god.
[5427.15s -> 5428.03s]  Is he stuck?
[5428.03s -> 5428.99s]  Was I supposed to do that?
[5429.87s -> 5436.38s]  Invisibility bench.
[5436.38s -> 5437.02s]  Should I use this?
[5439.26s -> 5439.98s]  Oh shit.
[5440.70s -> 5441.10s]  Oh shit.
[5441.10s -> 5441.74s]  Can I get through?
[5442.70s -> 5443.18s]  I can't.
[5443.18s -> 5443.66s]  Good.
[5443.66s -> 5444.30s]  Fuck this guy.
[5447.42s -> 5447.74s]  All right.
[5447.74s -> 5449.10s]  Let's go light the torch.
[5452.62s -> 5455.60s]  Can't find me.
[5456.96s -> 5458.16s]  Should I just sit in one of the seats?
[5460.56s -> 5468.52s]  Hi.
[5469.56s -> 5477.76s]  There's like a chest over there.
[5477.76s -> 5478.80s]  I can't even do anything.
[5478.80s -> 5479.60s]  I have to just leave.
[5482.24s -> 5489.34s]  Hiding.
[5489.98s -> 5490.94s]  There is no hiding.
[5491.58s -> 5493.42s]  It's one of those tank control games
[5493.42s -> 5495.02s]  where you can't even see the...
[5495.02s -> 5496.46s]  They'll give you one camera angle.
[5504.72s -> 5505.68s]  There is one.
[5505.68s -> 5506.32s]  We are in a...
[5507.20s -> 5529.80s]  Fight that thing.
[5529.80s -> 5530.84s]  He's already on me.
[5532.20s -> 5533.20s]  All right.
[5533.20s -> 5533.52s]  I need to...
[5534.16s -> 5538.33s]  And can I do the invisibility band?
[5545.16s -> 5545.32s]  Take.
[5545.32s -> 5545.96s]  I'm gonna do it here.
[5546.60s -> 5551.40s]  I'm invisible now.
[5551.40s -> 5556.60s]  Just enough to...
[5561.18s -> 5561.42s]  Light.
[5561.98s -> 5570.43s]  The light from the lantern illuminates the room.
[5573.29s -> 5580.80s]  Fuck.
[5580.80s -> 5582.08s]  I don't want to screw this up.
[5582.08s -> 5583.20s]  How do I stop that from happening?
[5583.20s -> 5583.52s]  How am I...
[5583.52s -> 5584.24s]  Why am I doing that?
[5584.88s -> 5587.92s]  I didn't read the manual about
[5587.92s -> 5596.28s]  walking across the board.
[5596.28s -> 5597.72s]  At this point just fall forward.
[5597.72s -> 5597.96s]  Okay?
[5602.06s -> 5603.02s]  Flyers.
[5603.02s -> 5606.28s]  The door with the barbed wire on it.
[5606.28s -> 5607.40s]  Where was that door though?
[5607.96s -> 5610.04s]  There was that barbed wire door.
[5610.68s -> 5612.56s]  Which one was that?
[5612.56s -> 5613.20s]  Where was that?
[5618.41s -> 5619.05s]  Bottom floor?
[5626.24s -> 5626.88s]  Start of the game.
[5626.88s -> 5627.68s]  It was in the house.
[5628.24s -> 5630.96s]  No, I know.
[5630.96s -> 5632.00s]  I know I saw it somewhere.
[5632.88s -> 5634.56s]  Don't fall off and make me start over.
[5636.52s -> 5638.28s]  Should I put on the Harry Potter invisibility cloak?
[5639.47s -> 5639.87s]  Please.
[5643.90s -> 5645.02s]  Fall joke incoming.
[5645.02s -> 5646.06s]  I'm not going to do that.
[5646.06s -> 5646.94s]  Not in a game like this.
[5652.80s -> 5654.32s]  That requires backtracking
[5654.32s -> 5656.56s]  and then I have a save point from...
[5656.56s -> 5657.76s]  Oh, here we go again.
[5658.32s -> 5664.16s]  I think that's my mother.
[5664.16s -> 5665.12s]  That's gonna be my mom.
[5668.62s -> 5670.06s]  Backtracking but with a secret door?
[5674.28s -> 5674.92s]  Um...
[5674.92s -> 5676.65s]  What do I...
[5676.65s -> 5677.53s]  What do I do about this?
[5678.89s -> 5680.01s]  Mom, help me!
[5680.01s -> 5680.57s]  Mom, like get...
[5681.37s -> 5690.11s]  Okay, you didn't...
[5690.11s -> 5690.75s]  I got put in...
[5690.75s -> 5691.07s]  I got...
[5691.07s -> 5691.87s]  Out of the cut scene.
[5692.75s -> 5693.15s]  Okay.
[5693.15s -> 5694.35s]  Out of the cut scene.
[5694.35s -> 5694.99s]  I couldn't move.
[5695.79s -> 5703.47s]  It worked!
[5703.47s -> 5703.95s]  It worked!
[5704.99s -> 5713.74s]  Come on!
[5713.74s -> 5714.38s]  Come on, come on, come on!
[5714.38s -> 5715.18s]  Out, out, out, out, out!
[5716.14s -> 5722.91s]  Okay, I gotta get...
[5722.91s -> 5723.55s]  I just gotta leave.
[5725.07s -> 5738.81s]  Where am I going?
[5738.81s -> 5739.13s]  Oh, no!
[5739.13s -> 5739.93s]  I had to go the other way.
[5740.73s -> 5741.13s]  Shit!
[5742.17s -> 5748.38s]  Leave!
[5755.04s -> 5755.60s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[5762.70s -> 5763.42s]  Leave.
[5763.42s -> 5766.70s]  I'm stuck on shit.
[5766.70s -> 5767.66s]  Oh, hey, mom!
[5769.18s -> 5772.20s]  Oh, you could like fly in his face
[5772.20s -> 5773.56s]  and like sprinkle dust in his eyes.
[5775.16s -> 5775.64s]  I have to do it.
[5775.64s -> 5776.04s]  I have to do it.
[5776.04s -> 5776.28s]  I have to do it.
[5776.28s -> 5777.32s]  I have to do it.
[5777.32s -> 5793.34s]  Hey, Jerma.
[5793.34s -> 5794.70s]  I'm back from YouTubing the ending
[5794.70s -> 5796.06s]  and this game is fucking whack.
[5802.36s -> 5802.68s]  Thanks.
[5807.79s -> 5808.35s]  Okay, I...
[5810.30s -> 5811.18s]  I hate this guy.
[5816.32s -> 5830.08s]  Splash in eyes.
[5830.08s -> 5830.56s]  Refill.
[5834.25s -> 5834.97s]  No, no, no.
[5834.97s -> 5836.25s]  I don't want to save it right here.
[5838.09s -> 5838.65s]  Refill.
[5840.33s -> 5848.81s]  Oh, refill.
[5850.99s -> 5851.23s]  Run.
[5854.83s -> 5856.75s]  Come on, mom!
[5856.75s -> 5859.28s]  What the fuck are you doing, mom?
[5859.28s -> 5859.76s]  Hey!
[5859.76s -> 5861.12s]  What the hell are you doing?
[5862.16s -> 5863.68s]  Why did you do that to me?
[5864.64s -> 5868.92s]  You're supposed to be guiding me.
[5868.92s -> 5869.80s]  Do that to him.
[5879.42s -> 5880.14s]  They made that...
[5880.86s -> 5881.10s]  They...
[5881.10s -> 5883.85s]  You don't introduce a character like that.
[5883.85s -> 5887.05s]  The floating purple glittery butterfly.
[5889.16s -> 5890.44s]  Oh, I'm guiding you.
[5890.44s -> 5892.52s]  Look, I'm here and it's a bad guy.
[5893.47s -> 5894.11s]  That was great.
[5901.02s -> 5902.94s]  That's not your mom or an ally.
[5902.94s -> 5903.98s]  I don't know what...
[5903.98s -> 5904.86s]  Butterflies in...
[5904.86s -> 5905.66s]  It's a video game.
[5906.38s -> 5907.82s]  No, I want the save point that I had.
[5908.54s -> 5909.34s]  No, I didn't have it.
[5913.93s -> 5915.13s]  How am I supposed to think?
[5915.13s -> 5916.41s]  It's a horror game
[5916.41s -> 5918.89s]  and there's a shiny, beautiful butterfly
[5918.89s -> 5921.37s]  that has been shown a few times during the game.
[5922.49s -> 5924.92s]  I need to...
[5924.92s -> 5925.32s]  I'm dead.
[5929.34s -> 5935.64s]  Watch out for the butterfly.
[5937.40s -> 5940.60s]  The sonar stingray thing that just flies around.
[5941.64s -> 5942.20s]  The bat.
[5949.82s -> 5950.14s]  Lake.
[5950.14s -> 5952.78s]  Thank you, Lake Drinker, for the five community subs.
[5954.06s -> 5961.80s]  All right, where's that room?
[5965.55s -> 5966.64s]  It's like down here?
[5968.16s -> 5968.56s]  I don't even...
[5968.56s -> 5969.20s]  I have no idea.
[5971.20s -> 5972.76s]  In here?
[5973.72s -> 5976.49s]  In here?
[5980.43s -> 5981.39s]  Not down here, is it?
[5987.15s -> 5987.55s]  There it is.
[5988.19s -> 5992.40s]  The suppliers go indoor.
[5993.04s -> 5998.19s]  They lose the sky.
[5999.15s -> 6001.52s]  Okay, I think I'm safe.
[6001.52s -> 6002.08s]  Am I safe?
[6003.71s -> 6004.19s]  I think so.
[6004.67s -> 6008.70s]  A carved wooden box.
[6008.70s -> 6009.50s]  Open it.
[6009.50s -> 6009.74s]  Yes.
[6010.54s -> 6018.72s]  Is this supposed to be me?
[6019.52s -> 6029.66s]  Oh, you're doing a very good job playing the piano, Lissa.
[6029.66s -> 6030.46s]  That's the big reveal.
[6030.46s -> 6031.18s]  Like, what the fuck?
[6031.18s -> 6032.06s]  It's that guy's voice.
[6060.72s -> 6062.80s]  You're the most precious thing to me in the whole world.
[6063.52s -> 6064.40s]  But don't worry.
[6065.20s -> 6068.16s]  Daddy, don't forget the piano concourse is on Christmas Eve.
[6068.80s -> 6071.28s]  The winner will have their performance aired on the radio.
[6072.08s -> 6074.40s]  I'll practice really hard and win the contest
[6075.04s -> 6077.12s]  so that you can hear me when you're out in the war.
[6077.92s -> 6078.80s]  That would be wonderful.
[6079.76s -> 6080.88s]  The competition will be stiff,
[6080.88s -> 6082.88s]  but if you go to your lessons and practice properly,
[6082.88s -> 6084.00s]  I'm sure you can do it.
[6084.56s -> 6086.00s]  I'll practice every day.
[6086.96s -> 6089.20s]  I've already chosen the piece I'm going to play.
[6089.20s -> 6096.38s]  Listen, you told me this watch was a present from mommy
[6096.38s -> 6098.06s]  before you got married, remember?
[6098.06s -> 6100.54s]  Is this like the narrator from Peppa Pig?
[6100.54s -> 6102.22s]  So you can think of mommy and me.
[6102.22s -> 6104.30s]  Then it'll be like we're all together again.
[6104.30s -> 6105.82s]  She sounds like she's like 50.
[6106.78s -> 6120.00s]  What a weird piano.
[6121.60s -> 6122.56s]  Wait, what the fuck?
[6129.00s -> 6145.68s]  It's fucking horrible.
[6145.68s -> 6146.72s]  Why would they do this?
[6161.80s -> 6162.60s]  What the fuck?
[6164.36s -> 6165.08s]  That was too-
[6165.08s -> 6166.36s]  That was too fast.
[6167.00s -> 6169.21s]  That was too fast.
[6170.09s -> 6175.71s]  Oh my god, that was awful.
[6179.60s -> 6180.64s]  Holy shit.
[6181.44s -> 6186.91s]  I didn't even have any time to fucking process
[6186.91s -> 6187.95s]  what I just looked at.
[6188.92s -> 6191.56s]  It was just, all of a sudden the guy flies.
[6192.60s -> 6193.64s]  Oh my god.
[6198.68s -> 6200.44s]  All right, the hammer killer.
[6207.13s -> 6209.85s]  Robert Morris, 32, the man known as the hammer killer,
[6209.85s -> 6210.65s]  has been hanged.
[6211.21s -> 6213.45s]  Rumors regarding Morris's death are widespread.
[6213.45s -> 6216.73s]  One witness reported he was hanging for a very long time,
[6216.73s -> 6219.69s]  pulling on the straps and making unearthly noises.
[6219.69s -> 6221.69s]  And blood was oozing through the black cap.
[6221.69s -> 6222.97s]  The stench was terrible.
[6222.97s -> 6224.97s]  Some witnesses fainted and were carried out.
[6226.25s -> 6227.53s]  This is too many things.
[6227.53s -> 6229.21s]  Can we just go back to when they were playing the piano?
[6229.77s -> 6231.21s]  Too many things happened in a row here.
[6232.89s -> 6235.13s]  Morris's first victim was Tony Flanagan,
[6235.13s -> 6238.17s]  a fellow employee at the Banbury stone cutting factory.
[6240.08s -> 6245.76s]  On June 6th, Morris suddenly struck Flanagan on the head with a hammer.
[6248.24s -> 6271.36s]  Sensory overload, I'm sorry guys.
[6272.16s -> 6273.28s]  None of this is like comedic.
[6273.28s -> 6275.44s]  It's just like too much sensory overload.
[6275.44s -> 6278.72s]  Killing him instantly, all five workers present were killed in the same manner.
[6278.72s -> 6279.84s]  Morris disappeared thereafter.
[6279.84s -> 6282.72s]  A string of similar crimes occurred until the time of Morris's arrest
[6283.52s -> 6284.56s]  on the 6th of March.
[6285.52s -> 6289.12s]  Morris's victim is numbered 12 and no clear motive has been determined.
[6290.38s -> 6294.06s]  Specialists continue to be baffled by the seemingly abrupt change in his behavior,
[6294.06s -> 6296.06s]  as well as the extreme violence of his crime.
[6296.70s -> 6298.62s]  Kind of like the last five minutes of the game.
[6299.42s -> 6302.06s]  An extreme abrupt change in tone.
[6303.10s -> 6312.16s]  Maybe I can save May if I get her father's pocket watch to her.
[6312.16s -> 6314.48s]  Okay, I have to take the pocket watch to the concert hall.
[6323.61s -> 6324.97s]  Okay, is that guy still here?
[6325.61s -> 6332.49s]  The stream will pause suddenly for no...
[6332.49s -> 6333.53s]  I got no drop frames.
[6336.40s -> 6337.84s]  I have zero drop frames so far.
[6338.56s -> 6340.20s]  Is the stream having a problem?
[6347.48s -> 6348.52s]  It was muting you.
[6349.56s -> 6351.24s]  Oh, that's weird.
[6351.24s -> 6351.88s]  I don't know why.
[6352.92s -> 6355.00s]  All right, so I get the pocket watch back to mom.
[6358.17s -> 6360.33s]  I have to take the pocket watch to the concert hall.
[6363.69s -> 6364.97s]  Your voice is bad.
[6366.30s -> 6368.06s]  Like sound quality coming through,
[6368.06s -> 6370.86s]  or you just think you don't like how I sound, you hate my accent or something.
[6371.50s -> 6391.53s]  All right, here he comes.
[6392.33s -> 6393.37s]  Back to the concert hall.
[6400.38s -> 6401.02s]  Extreme.
[6417.79s -> 6418.51s]  No butterflies?
[6418.51s -> 6420.27s]  No... what is that?
[6420.27s -> 6421.47s]  There's a glowing thing down there.
[6422.35s -> 6423.71s]  Is there a way I can get down here?
[6427.10s -> 6427.90s]  Yes, there is.
[6427.90s -> 6429.02s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[6430.22s -> 6436.08s]  Oh, cool.
[6438.38s -> 6439.18s]  Lavender water.
[6439.74s -> 6448.14s]  Stop calling them butterflies.
[6448.14s -> 6449.02s]  They're moths.
[6449.98s -> 6456.60s]  What does it say?
[6461.18s -> 6462.38s]  He, he, he, he, lamp.
[6462.38s -> 6463.74s]  He, he, what does that mean?
[6463.74s -> 6473.26s]  Am I mad?
[6473.26s -> 6479.76s]  He doesn't know.
[6479.76s -> 6480.40s]  He doesn't know.
[6489.16s -> 6490.20s]  Yeah, I've been waiting for you.
[6490.20s -> 6492.12s]  You figured me out, little girl.
[6494.04s -> 6496.41s]  It's like it's the Hammer Killer.
[6496.41s -> 6498.09s]  They thought they got rid of me that day,
[6498.09s -> 6506.56s]  and they got us because it was only the beginning, next.
[6509.88s -> 6510.92s]  A lot of random...
[6510.92s -> 6515.53s]  All right, boss battles.
[6515.53s -> 6517.45s]  This is an actual boss battle.
[6518.67s -> 6519.15s]  Control...
[6519.95s -> 6521.31s]  Duck shoot arrow.
[6523.32s -> 6524.28s]  We have arrows.
[6526.12s -> 6528.76s]  Shoot arrow, charge arrow, super attack.
[6530.25s -> 6531.53s]  Hold down triangle button,
[6531.53s -> 6534.49s]  or hold down triangle button with enemy transfixed.
[6535.21s -> 6536.57s]  R1 is special.
[6539.77s -> 6540.57s]  Battle strategy.
[6540.57s -> 6541.53s]  In order to defeat the enemy,
[6541.53s -> 6543.29s]  Alyssa must first transfix it.
[6543.93s -> 6546.49s]  By hitting the enemy with a charged arrow,
[6546.49s -> 6549.05s]  it is possible to fix them to the spot.
[6549.77s -> 6551.77s]  Several strategically placed chains
[6551.77s -> 6553.69s]  will transfix the target.
[6554.49s -> 6557.29s]  Aim so that the chains fan out from the target
[6557.29s -> 6558.65s]  who should be in the center.
[6559.85s -> 6561.29s]  While the enemy is transfixed,
[6561.29s -> 6563.85s]  Alyssa is able to carry out a super attack.
[6563.85s -> 6565.45s]  It is no easy task, however,
[6565.45s -> 6567.05s]  to hit the target with the arrow.
[6567.05s -> 6568.49s]  Watch the enemy's movements closely
[6568.49s -> 6569.53s]  and wait for your chance.
[6570.73s -> 6573.37s]  Duck can be used to avoid attack by certain enemies.
[6573.37s -> 6574.65s]  It may also cause them to become
[6574.65s -> 6576.09s]  careless and vulnerable to attack.
[6576.89s -> 6579.77s]  Press the R1 button to use special arrows
[6579.77s -> 6581.69s]  such as the repellent arrow
[6581.69s -> 6585.05s]  in order in which they were obtained.
[6585.05s -> 6586.49s]  It is wise to save these weapons
[6586.49s -> 6587.61s]  for special occasions.
[6590.28s -> 6591.56s]  So let me get this straight.
[6591.56s -> 6593.56s]  So shoot arrow is triangle.
[6593.56s -> 6594.84s]  You want to charge the arrow
[6594.84s -> 6596.44s]  and then shoot them with a charged arrow
[6598.28s -> 6599.24s]  to transfix them.
[6602.00s -> 6604.40s]  So you lock them in a spot
[6604.96s -> 6606.32s]  and then there will be chains
[6607.20s -> 6608.96s]  that are placed around the map here
[6608.96s -> 6610.16s]  that will transfix them.
[6610.88s -> 6614.06s]  So the chains fan out from the target
[6614.06s -> 6615.42s]  should be in the center of the target.
[6616.38s -> 6617.37s]  Let's just...
[6617.37s -> 6618.89s]  I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[6623.44s -> 6627.02s]  Am I actually getting...
[6627.02s -> 6628.94s]  Am I gonna do a transformation sequence here?
[6629.90s -> 6630.97s]  I am.
[6630.97s -> 6632.89s]  Now don't come out in the superhero outfit, please.
[6641.29s -> 6642.81s]  Here comes the transform sequence.
[6642.81s -> 6645.45s]  Hopefully we get some like pop music behind.
[6649.68s -> 6650.88s]  No, it's just a staple gun.
[6657.26s -> 6658.46s]  Somehow she knows how to use it.
[6659.18s -> 6668.51s]  Uh, if you're done, I'd like to begin.
[6670.51s -> 6671.23s]  Sledgehammer.
[6673.05s -> 6674.33s]  Victims 26.
[6676.16s -> 6679.20s]  Sentenced to 486 years in prison.
[6679.92s -> 6681.34s]  I have to...
[6681.34s -> 6682.14s]  Wait, I'm the judge?
[6683.26s -> 6683.82s]  Judgment.
[6685.12s -> 6686.48s]  This is a different video game.
[6697.02s -> 6697.58s]  Okay.
[6699.45s -> 6700.41s]  Get up, Alyssa.
[6701.29s -> 6703.98s]  So there's also evade too.
[6703.98s -> 6705.18s]  I can evade attacks.
[6705.74s -> 6716.78s]  I can't even pause it because I'm gonna go off on a fucking rant right now.
[6716.78s -> 6717.58s]  I gotta go off on a rant.
[6717.58s -> 6718.38s]  Okay, I can pause it.
[6718.38s -> 6718.94s]  Let me...
[6718.94s -> 6719.44s]  Okay.
[6720.06s -> 6723.69s]  I understand like driving around like cars is cool
[6723.69s -> 6725.37s]  and like it's fun to drive around a car.
[6725.37s -> 6730.28s]  But are you just driving around in a circle?
[6731.40s -> 6732.60s]  You know, like what are you doing?
[6733.16s -> 6733.72s]  Like, do you...
[6734.60s -> 6736.60s]  Okay, drive fast here.
[6737.08s -> 6743.37s]  But are you just driving around in a circle?
[6744.01s -> 6745.13s]  Like, what are you doing?
[6745.77s -> 6746.75s]  Like, do you...
[6747.63s -> 6749.39s]  Okay, drive fast here.
[6749.63s -> 6751.71s]  In like a four-mile circle.
[6752.44s -> 6753.24s]  Over and over again.
[6755.79s -> 6757.63s]  How many times can you do that before it's like,
[6757.63s -> 6760.35s]  oh, this is like I'm kind of just doing this over and over again.
[6764.80s -> 6765.92s]  Stand in the road.
[6766.56s -> 6773.21s]  Excuse me!
[6773.21s -> 6776.25s]  It's almost like that this is like on an NPC route.
[6776.25s -> 6785.18s]  That's an AI doing that.
[6785.18s -> 6787.90s]  Like that's like a GTA NPC.
[6787.90s -> 6789.74s]  It's just driving around in a circle.
[6789.74s -> 6798.09s]  It's just that picture of the guy standing in front of the...
[6798.09s -> 6801.40s]  Wait, what?
[6801.40s -> 6802.68s]  That's Vegas for you.
[6802.68s -> 6804.60s]  I understand what the fuck is happening.
[6805.64s -> 6807.64s]  Imagine if every five minutes I just went...
[6808.20s -> 6809.24s]  Hey!
[6809.88s -> 6810.38s]  Every day.
[6811.16s -> 6813.56s]  You know how irritating that would be for people that live in this house?
[6816.99s -> 6818.43s]  Okay, what's for dinner?
[6818.43s -> 6821.47s]  Well, we're gonna have carrots and meatloaf.
[6821.47s -> 6821.97s]  Hey!
[6823.07s -> 6824.35s]  Okay, thanks Jeremy.
[6824.35s -> 6825.79s]  We're gonna have carrots and meatloaf and...
[6826.35s -> 6828.72s]  All right, is that a chain over there?
[6832.36s -> 6833.00s]  No, I just...
[6833.00s -> 6837.16s]  I run around the house and I scream when I pass people's doors.
[6837.88s -> 6839.60s]  All right, this looks like a chain.
[6844.09s -> 6844.65s]  Got it right?
[6844.65s -> 6845.15s]  No?
[6845.15s -> 6845.65s]  No?
[6845.93s -> 6846.65s]  Shoot the chain?
[6856.19s -> 6865.56s]  He's blocking.
[6865.56s -> 6866.20s]  What about duck?
[6867.16s -> 6867.72s]  That didn't work.
[6868.76s -> 6873.07s]  Pin him to the wall?
[6874.32s -> 6875.44s]  This is three of them, right?
[6877.79s -> 6888.92s]  I mean, it's hurting him.
[6892.72s -> 6900.25s]  Aaron needs to be charged more.
[6901.13s -> 6902.25s]  He has a seismic wave.
[6903.05s -> 6907.02s]  So let's see if I can get it.
[6911.72s -> 6914.60s]  One, two, three, four.
[6916.30s -> 6917.34s]  All right, but there it is.
[6917.34s -> 6917.84s]  Okay.
[6918.94s -> 6920.46s]  One, two, three.
[6920.46s -> 6921.42s]  How far can he move with that?
[6922.30s -> 6928.22s]  Okay, again.
[6928.22s -> 6931.34s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[6932.22s -> 6933.42s]  All right, now he's held in place.
[6934.62s -> 6936.06s]  I can just shoot him.
[6936.06s -> 6942.56s]  How long is he in that for?
[6949.33s -> 6950.13s]  Keep charging.
[6953.17s -> 6953.97s]  Keep charging.
[6953.97s -> 6954.47s]  How?
[6954.47s -> 6955.25s]  Really?
[6955.25s -> 6959.41s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[6961.87s -> 6963.31s]  That's a max arrow.
[6963.31s -> 6969.39s]  Is this Mega Man X?
[6970.03s -> 6975.20s]  No, I knew like the charge and how it worked,
[6975.20s -> 6978.16s]  but I didn't know that it had like seven levels of charge.
[6987.47s -> 6987.97s]  R1?
[6988.51s -> 6989.89s]  R1.
[6990.43s -> 6994.18s]  What the hell am I doing?
[7000.02s -> 7000.52s]  Okay.
[7001.46s -> 7008.50s]  I call upon Zeus himself to draw the lightning.
[7010.62s -> 7014.86s]  This game makes no sense.
[7015.50s -> 7016.38s]  That was a limit break.
[7037.25s -> 7037.97s]  Your sentence?
[7039.97s -> 7040.77s]  Eternity.
[7041.41s -> 7053.04s]  Clover of Love.
[7053.76s -> 7058.85s]  All right, now we're gonna go lock it back to bomb.
[7059.65s -> 7068.77s]  Let's save the game.
[7069.33s -> 7071.09s]  Just in case something really bad happens.
[7076.86s -> 7080.38s]  Hey, do you guys know that there's like 12 more seasons of Rick and Morty
[7080.38s -> 7081.34s]  that are gonna come on the way?
[7082.77s -> 7083.81s]  And you know that?
[7083.81s -> 7087.41s]  There's gonna be like 15 seasons of Rick and Morty.
[7088.51s -> 7089.31s]  They've already been ordered.
[7089.31s -> 7091.47s]  At least like nine more seasons have already been ordered.
[7092.11s -> 7093.23s]  So all you guys that are like,
[7093.23s -> 7094.19s]  I don't like Rick and Morty.
[7096.03s -> 7097.47s]  Got like 10 more years of this shit.
[7098.03s -> 7104.78s]  The bad show.
[7109.23s -> 7110.03s]  Auto voice.
[7110.59s -> 7111.79s]  Mom, I've got something for you.
[7112.67s -> 7118.99s]  Journal confirmed Rick and Morty.
[7119.71s -> 7123.57s]  I'm not like a fan of Rick and Morty.
[7124.61s -> 7130.85s]  Hydrate.
[7130.85s -> 7131.49s]  I refuse.
[7145.34s -> 7146.14s]  How do I know this?
[7150.16s -> 7150.96s]  How do I know that?
[7162.00s -> 7162.50s]  What?
[7163.84s -> 7164.80s]  Isn't she dead?
[7173.52s -> 7174.96s]  This person's not rea- what?
[7175.68s -> 7176.96s]  Yeah, this person's a ghost.
[7178.46s -> 7179.42s]  Why would I say that?
[7181.20s -> 7183.36s]  Yes, just keep playing the piano forever.
[7183.92s -> 7186.88s]  By the way, your father's dead.
[7186.88s -> 7193.02s]  Oh, so she can move on.
[7193.02s -> 7193.66s]  Oh, I get it.
[7201.50s -> 7210.48s]  So was he the serial killer?
[7210.48s -> 7211.28s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7211.28s -> 7212.64s]  No, he was in the war.
[7212.64s -> 7212.96s]  Okay.
[7212.96s -> 7213.20s]  Right.
[7213.20s -> 7215.76s]  No, that looks-
[7219.15s -> 7219.55s]  I'm not-
[7219.55s -> 7220.43s]  This is not fun.
[7221.39s -> 7223.07s]  The subject matter is not funny.
[7223.07s -> 7223.31s]  Okay?
[7223.31s -> 7225.23s]  Let me just be very clear about something.
[7225.23s -> 7225.87s]  The subject-
[7233.49s -> 7248.70s]  It's the presentation that is kind of all over the place.
[7249.66s -> 7250.86s]  As you can plainly see.
[7250.86s -> 7253.42s]  The subject matter is not like funny.
[7254.30s -> 7267.65s]  But the way that he was like floating up,
[7268.37s -> 7270.61s]  like a Teletubbies episode,
[7270.61s -> 7271.73s]  like what the hell was that?
[7288.40s -> 7290.00s]  No, it's the serial killer back again.
[7299.44s -> 7300.80s]  What the fuck is going on?
[7302.16s -> 7302.72s]  What is he-
[7304.00s -> 7304.56s]  Help him!
[7306.00s -> 7306.64s]  Help this guy!
[7316.10s -> 7318.10s]  He's looking at this weird animation.
[7325.70s -> 7329.38s]  Where's Harry?
[7342.50s -> 7345.62s]  Why is he rolling around like he's coming in bees or ants?
[7348.26s -> 7349.38s]  You can't go that fast.
[7355.02s -> 7357.26s]  That's like extreme pantomime.
[7359.42s -> 7360.54s]  What is happening?
[7362.22s -> 7365.18s]  This reminds me of like bad theater.
[7367.82s -> 7369.50s]  They blocked out and choreographed the scene.
[7369.50s -> 7370.86s]  It's just a terrible theater production.
[7370.86s -> 7371.66s]  It's a bad play.
[7373.66s -> 7377.76s]  This is fucking so stupid.
[7383.39s -> 7385.10s]  I'll be right back.
[7385.10s -> 7385.90s]  I'm gonna take a piss.
[7385.90s -> 7387.26s]  I'll be back in fucking two minutes.
[7387.82s -> 7609.57s]  Okay.
[7610.53s -> 7612.27s]  Let us continue.
[7613.07s -> 7620.99s]  This game is ridiculous.
[7621.79s -> 7627.10s]  So I have the key to Dick's room.
[7627.74s -> 7630.82s]  Is this my house?
[7633.57s -> 7634.53s]  I'm very confused.
[7634.53s -> 7635.65s]  Do I have a map of this place?
[7638.10s -> 7638.98s]  Wrong button.
[7639.54s -> 7644.27s]  I just got here.
[7644.27s -> 7646.03s]  When does he play Apex Legends?
[7649.68s -> 7650.96s]  Apex Legends.
[7656.24s -> 7658.00s]  The door has been boarded up.
[7658.88s -> 7661.01s]  Wait, why do I still need to do this?
[7661.81s -> 7666.90s]  Why would you put a spell on the bathroom?
[7673.34s -> 7674.30s]  That's next level.
[7674.30s -> 7675.34s]  Don't go in there.
[7675.34s -> 7677.18s]  You took like such a big dump in here.
[7677.98s -> 7680.46s]  That you really don't want somebody to go in.
[7681.41s -> 7682.53s]  The dead body in here.
[7683.60s -> 7684.88s]  One of the lodges view.
[7684.88s -> 7685.60s]  What a stink.
[7696.99s -> 7697.87s]  Get off me, please.
[7704.14s -> 7705.02s]  Nancy.
[7705.02s -> 7706.14s]  I'm gonna go to Dick's room.
[7710.94s -> 7713.18s]  The three-way mirror has been folded up.
[7713.90s -> 7716.54s]  What else you got here?
[7719.18s -> 7720.22s]  What a dumb painting.
[7720.86s -> 7722.82s]  What was wrong with the first one?
[7728.91s -> 7729.31s]  All right.
[7729.31s -> 7732.19s]  So there's another painting stuck under the first one.
[7733.25s -> 7734.45s]  This one has a clock on it.
[7735.17s -> 7736.69s]  And it is at 3 p.m.
[7737.41s -> 7742.86s]  Throw that one in the trash.
[7742.86s -> 7743.50s]  Why is this here?
[7743.50s -> 7743.74s]  All right.
[7743.74s -> 7744.30s]  3 p.m.
[7744.86s -> 7745.66s]  Is that 3 p.m.
[7745.66s -> 7748.35s]  Or is that 12 15?
[7748.99s -> 7756.11s]  Well, it's either 3 or 12 15.
[7756.67s -> 7757.63s]  This is Mum's bed.
[7758.35s -> 7763.31s]  All right.
[7763.31s -> 7764.19s]  Well, now we have a...
[7764.19s -> 7764.83s]  Well, here you go.
[7765.47s -> 7766.99s]  The clock has stopped ticking.
[7766.99s -> 7769.79s]  You'll need a special winding key to get it working again.
[7770.67s -> 7771.55s]  Of course I do.
[7775.86s -> 7777.06s]  Mom had a lot of shit, huh?
[7778.10s -> 7779.70s]  This desk is in such a dumb place.
[7780.42s -> 7782.26s]  What is the feng shui in here?
[7782.58s -> 7784.26s]  You might have a desk in the middle of your room.
[7785.30s -> 7785.94s]  Two desks.
[7786.50s -> 7789.26s]  What a sloppy...
[7789.26s -> 7790.22s]  Look at this nightstand.
[7790.22s -> 7791.10s]  Why is a bed here?
[7797.33s -> 7802.51s]  I would appreciate it if you didn't change the camera on me.
[7802.51s -> 7803.71s]  There's a computer on the desk.
[7803.71s -> 7804.67s]  I wish I had one too.
[7806.54s -> 7806.94s]  What's this?
[7806.94s -> 7807.42s]  I'm gonna sneeze.
[7809.22s -> 7810.10s]  Oh, I couldn't get it.
[7810.10s -> 7810.42s]  I'm sorry.
[7811.30s -> 7812.96s]  It just happens sometimes.
[7812.96s -> 7813.52s]  I couldn't do it.
[7815.90s -> 7816.62s]  Okay.
[7816.62s -> 7821.07s]  Nothing else.
[7821.63s -> 7822.96s]  I have Dick's key.
[7826.75s -> 7828.11s]  Mum must know what's going on.
[7829.23s -> 7830.27s]  Where is Mum?
[7830.27s -> 7832.05s]  Must have left in a hurry.
[7832.05s -> 7833.09s]  The wardrobe is still open.
[7839.10s -> 7839.74s]  Why is there a ghost?
[7839.74s -> 7841.10s]  Is that Mum in the bathtub?
[7841.90s -> 7843.18s]  I don't know who is that.
[7850.27s -> 7851.87s]  Why is it just a ghost in the house?
[7852.43s -> 7860.32s]  All right, we need to find Dick's room.
[7860.88s -> 7864.56s]  Let me look at the map again.
[7864.56s -> 7866.74s]  Do I have a legend or anything?
[7870.02s -> 7874.10s]  Is there a way I can get to the appendix of this legend?
[7874.10s -> 7875.06s]  Of this map?
[7875.06s -> 7875.70s]  Get to the legend.
[7878.10s -> 7878.90s]  Looking for the append...
[7878.90s -> 7881.14s]  Oh, apex legend is what I'm looking for.
[7885.12s -> 7885.44s]  Don't.
[7886.16s -> 7887.04s]  Don't do it.
[7890.40s -> 7890.72s]  Don't.
[7892.37s -> 7893.57s]  Couldn't I crawl through here before?
[7897.92s -> 7898.80s]  Don't.
[7898.80s -> 7903.65s]  This is Alyssa's room.
[7903.65s -> 7904.37s]  Is he still in here?
[7908.51s -> 7910.27s]  It's as if that nightmare never took place.
[7910.83s -> 7916.50s]  Wait, what's across the way?
[7916.50s -> 7916.98s]  Is that Dick?
[7925.14s -> 7927.54s]  Is this going to be a clock tower stream?
[7928.26s -> 7931.20s]  Nothing of interest here.
[7931.84s -> 7932.83s]  Who is it?
[7932.83s -> 7933.15s]  Philip?
[7933.79s -> 7934.19s]  Damn it.
[7938.26s -> 7938.66s]  I don't know.
[7938.66s -> 7940.18s]  I'm just kind of playing it.
[7940.99s -> 7942.99s]  I knew I was going to play this for at least a couple hours.
[7942.99s -> 7947.06s]  I knew it just by the first 20 minutes.
[7947.62s -> 7948.90s]  Well, let's just save it at least.
[7949.46s -> 7957.20s]  And as it happens, sometimes you get locked in one.
[7963.09s -> 7964.77s]  I was promised 12 hours.
[7964.77s -> 7967.97s]  No, one of these games has a 12-hour timer on it.
[7968.91s -> 7970.35s]  And I don't know what to do with it.
[7971.42s -> 7972.86s]  I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with it.
[7973.42s -> 7979.95s]  I need to find the right moment to play that game.
[7981.95s -> 7982.83s]  Where's Dick's room?
[7990.66s -> 7991.78s]  Filled with art and antiques.
[7991.78s -> 7993.14s]  Grandpa used to collect these things.
[7993.14s -> 7993.38s]  Right.
[7993.94s -> 7996.78s]  It's locked.
[7996.78s -> 7997.98s]  The lodges won't be coming back.
[7997.98s -> 7998.54s]  All right.
[7998.54s -> 7999.74s]  I need to find this room.
[8005.06s -> 8006.85s]  Well, that was a random find.
[8007.97s -> 8010.50s]  He didn't even have a label on his door.
[8011.58s -> 8013.50s]  Your room is really, really weird too.
[8016.59s -> 8017.47s]  All these old books.
[8017.47s -> 8018.59s]  What was he studying?
[8021.62s -> 8022.50s]  Dog magics.
[8023.06s -> 8027.38s]  All right.
[8027.38s -> 8034.69s]  If you got this many books, it might be time to donate some of them.
[8034.69s -> 8036.21s]  There is a scribbled note.
[8036.21s -> 8040.21s]  The keys to the mystery of time lie behind you.
[8040.93s -> 8045.94s]  What a stupid note.
[8045.94s -> 8047.90s]  Book of Entities 1.
[8049.82s -> 8053.18s]  Entities have existed in the human realm since Roman days.
[8053.98s -> 8058.62s]  These beings have been known to possess innocent humans, imbuing them with
[8058.62s -> 8063.98s]  utter ruthlessness and cruelty and often driving the possessed to vicious acts of murder.
[8064.78s -> 8069.66s]  In such cases, executing the murderer does not break the circle of evil.
[8069.66s -> 8073.58s]  The possessed is resurrected to continue its bloodthirsty mission.
[8074.90s -> 8077.86s]  Those who are thus controlled by entities are known as
[8078.96s -> 8081.28s]  sub, uh, apex legends.
[8082.08s -> 8087.30s]  When a subordinate kills a human, they take nourishment from the victim's soul
[8088.02s -> 8089.38s]  and their power grows.
[8090.10s -> 8093.98s]  Subordinates may acquire an infinite amount of power in this manner.
[8093.98s -> 8098.14s]  It follows then that subordinates are sustained by human misery and suffering.
[8099.33s -> 8102.85s]  Only certain humans are equipped to fight entities and their subordinates,
[8103.41s -> 8110.45s]  the Rooters, who are always young women in their teens,
[8111.09s -> 8114.45s]  have been battling against these shadowy enemies for hundreds of years.
[8115.09s -> 8118.45s]  Their war is likely to continue for many centuries to come.
[8119.52s -> 8120.56s]  Yes it does.
[8120.56s -> 8122.13s]  Yes it will.
[8122.13s -> 8126.69s]  Considering the amount of 500 years in the future after this game takes place,
[8127.33s -> 8133.17s]  animes with the same exact plot as this game.
[8146.14s -> 8146.62s]  Serpents!
[8149.58s -> 8152.78s]  Dude I'm thinking about getting that as like a tat like the serpent eating its own serpent.
[8173.41s -> 8175.25s]  Why the fuck are you dressed like Freddy Krueger?
[8204.51s -> 8206.03s]  Is this our new contact?
[8218.61s -> 8219.57s]  There they are again.
[8219.57s -> 8221.09s]  Yep, has it been 10 minutes?
[8221.25s -> 8237.26s]  All of a sudden a bunch of like fucking Chili's employees come out and they're like
[8238.06s -> 8244.46s]  happy birthday to you happy birthday and they bring a shitty cupcake with one candle in it.
[8244.46s -> 8259.38s]  He went out really fast, loony tunes fast.
[8261.42s -> 8266.08s]  Okay a scribbled note yeah the keys to the mystery of time lie behind you so
[8266.08s -> 8275.79s]  over here these old books what was he studying something in the chair in his chair I went to
[8275.79s -> 8282.75s]  a place that charged us for the birthday thing see what you have to do is you go with you know
[8282.75s -> 8289.22s]  you want you want to do like oh hey like oh funny prank get like 15 people to go as groups
[8289.22s -> 8295.76s]  of like two in different places in the restaurant and it's everybody's birthday today
[8295.76s -> 8299.36s]  so they have to go around and do the birthday thing to like 15 different parties
[8301.52s -> 8306.16s]  and like you tip them a fucking you tip them like fucking 500 bucks after that by the way
[8324.02s -> 8335.15s]  I would fucking hate you if you did that you don't do that money does not forgive your sins
[8335.87s -> 8357.47s]  if you tipped me 150 dollars I would spill boiling soup on your lap why wait hold on
[8357.47s -> 8363.23s]  so if at the end of the meal it was like I wrote it oh yeah that was like a 42

[16163.86s -> 16174.37s]  i'm gonna sit here for as long as it's necessary he doesn't spawn until you take a step out
[16202.56s -> 16205.60s]  i'm not stalling i'm trying to make it so i don't have to use a potion
[16209.52s -> 16225.07s]  stalling or trying to play correctly which one let's keep going i need the gloves and then b3

[16514.06s -> 16542.56s]  power is flowing yes so go so open the door uh oh where's the key card
[16577.01s -> 16580.53s]  maybe i don't have to activate something here maybe i have to do the thing where i
[16580.53s -> 16590.74s]  burn them something else in here i guess i should activate this i'm just gonna catch
[16597.07s -> 16599.79s]  oh nice trick we know how this is
[16615.14s -> 16618.58s]  so i have an opportunity just to not have to worry about him now

[16626.02s -> 16635.63s]  have a crowbar does he have a card he doesn't have a card maybe i have to go back and use

[17034.67s -> 17039.87s]  be a bother although the larger spectrum of things this is time is quite minimal universe
[17039.87s -> 17046.67s]  took 13.7 billion years to form after over here i offer you uh 30 seconds of human communication
[17046.67s -> 17051.44s]  regardless thanks for answering ahead of time what are you talking about maybe one day i can

[17200.30s -> 17207.34s]  us a repellent arrow that's one of the bunnies from castle griffinstein so it's kind of odd
[17207.34s -> 17212.22s]  to see that here that's actually pretty terrifying uh brand new toy railway i can't be the one
[17212.22s -> 17225.41s]  i was given when i was a child where did i just end up mom gave me that statue it should

[17394.99s -> 17406.19s]  oh
[17408.69s -> 17411.01s]  going over the edge
[17425.36s -> 17434.21s]  why didn't you have to marry a man like you a man with no spy no spirit to axe turning
[17435.25s -> 17457.68s]  it's not funny but you've seen that truth it was your beloved grandfather who murdered
[17457.68s -> 17461.20s]  your father that's impossible it's not true
[17465.60s -> 17474.78s]  here we go boss fight i don't even know this guy's name it's time
[17480.80s -> 17487.20s]  you know if i was smarter and more prepared i would have already queued up like the sailor
[17487.20s -> 17492.08s]  moon transformation song just been playing it right now just imagine i did that just you do
[17492.08s -> 17518.22s]  it this is the we're almost done with the game here we go chopper 44 victims how many years in
[17518.22s -> 17546.34s]  prison 921 years sentenced your health bar is enormous judgment begin welcome he's doing some
[17546.34s -> 17552.80s]  cool tricks speaking of nice trick you can't get away
[17553.04s -> 17565.42s]  oh
[17577.02s -> 17579.42s]  you can't get away
[17585.58s -> 17593.57s]  so
[17597.17s -> 17609.26s]  that sucks the other guy was way harder oh wait you are going to suffer the same fate as all the
[17609.26s -> 17645.01s]  rest on magical bow no that was weird we didn't get the piece just an excuse to reuse him in
[17645.01s -> 17662.82s]  the next chapter that's probably what it is you'd be correct i would assume hey nice trick devs
[17668.37s -> 17680.37s]  the scroll that i just picked up 1998 may 12 my sweet elisa my sweet elisa you do a small
[17680.37s -> 17690.30s]  hands have grasped my heart and will not let go to think of the frizz it is more than i
[17690.30s -> 17697.34s]  can bear i consented to the marriage so as to protect the rudder bloodline i realize now that
[17697.34s -> 17704.75s]  was a foolish mistake and lacks class and has not a shred of dignity he loses no opportunity
[17704.75s -> 17714.43s]  to exhibit his stupidity and weakness of character even nancy has been affected by his
[17714.43s -> 17720.26s]  rubbish saying that she does not want to raise elisa to be a rudder of course the existence
[17720.26s -> 17726.02s]  of a rudder is fraught with danger but given the gravity of the situation and the great
[17726.02s -> 17733.46s]  responsibility of a rudder family the obligation cannot be shirked any attempt to avoid such a
[17733.46s -> 17741.10s]  duty is indeed shameful as long as i am the head of this house that man will never be accepted
[17741.10s -> 17752.02s]  as one of us no date finally philip went too far i could no longer allow him to large gap
[17752.02s -> 17763.65s]  there that headstrong act has turned me into a vile murder my secret to the cannot allow
[17763.65s -> 17771.15s]  Hamilton legacy to be disrupted there is nothing to be done but handle the police carefully
[17771.79s -> 17779.18s]  and tread with the utmost caution there's police in this universe i feel like they don't
[17779.18s -> 17795.18s]  there isn't now the cops are involved there's my magical rudder bloodline and monsters and
[17795.18s -> 17802.54s]  kratos's and all the fucked up magic that we have in this world bow and arrows made out of jewels
[17804.29s -> 17814.88s]  police yeah just dialed 911 to see if we could get them to come investigate is this one of
[17814.88s -> 17828.35s]  those things it's the magical police no it's not the magical police it's going to be like

[17987.79s -> 17994.75s]  i wish i just wish i could be resurrected to fight them what a shame a subordinate stole my heart
[17994.75s -> 18003.52s]  from me and the entities used it to perform the ritual of engagement wait what is the ritual
[18003.52s -> 18014.70s]  of engagement tell me tell me what's going on this game sucks

[23411.57s -> 23418.00s]  dead redemption 2 i already beat red dead redemption 2 i didn't beat it on stream i
[23418.00s -> 23429.41s]  beat it off stream play red dead 2 get out of this game i've used that exact lightning
[23429.41s -> 23438.56s]  sound effect actually i've used it on christmas the train and the train goes over the tracks and
[23438.56s -> 23454.88s]  gets the lightning strike thing what the hell is this that's grandpa right
[23478.42s -> 23486.30s]  play every game ever on stream very hard to do we're gonna get a narration here i think
[23487.02s -> 23496.70s]  today is yep i knew it the powers will become visible see you guys when you
[23496.70s -> 23502.43s]  wake up in like 10 minutes lisa is growing up into a lovely young lady she is everything to me
[23502.43s -> 23512.08s]  and i wish for nothing more than to watch over her every step she takes towards adulthood
[23512.08s -> 23520.40s]  is a step away from you i want so much to be with her i can't mute the music it's impossible
[23522.66s -> 23529.46s]  i have stumbled across an account of a ceremony called the ritual of engagement
[23530.42s -> 23532.50s]  it is written the bio didn't we already hear this
[23533.38s -> 23539.52s]  on her 15th birthday and drinking her blood person can be transformed into an entity
[23540.08s -> 23549.06s]  and receive the gift of immortality disgusted by this ritual of course at the same time there
[23549.06s -> 23555.18s]  is a part of me that cannot resist its allure i tore out alice's heart with these hands and
[23555.18s -> 23563.63s]  partook of her blood her for all eternity capable of such a monstrosity
[23564.35s -> 23570.03s]  must i desecrate my beloved in order to save myself so he's yeah he's gonna do it
[23571.78s -> 23579.74s]  yet another amazing discovery the legend of lord boris in the document is a mysterious
[23579.74s -> 23585.78s]  triangular crest it is said that the one who is able to decipher the secrets of the crest
[23586.42s -> 23593.06s]  will be able to become an entity i suspect that this too is related to the ritual of engagement
[23594.18s -> 23594.90s]  i can't skip this
[23602.72s -> 23606.32s]  uh alissa dennis and uh nancy whatever our names are
[23607.12s -> 23616.88s]  let's figure out the end of the game non-disclosure agreement i don't understand
[23616.88s -> 23622.19s]  he's just reading off like a concept for an rpg he like got invited to the blizzard
[23622.19s -> 23650.11s]  headquarters or something same point the nda i don't understand what it means i just see all
[23650.11s -> 23654.27s]  this weird shit about demons and monsters and drinking people's blood
[23655.47s -> 23664.21s]  and also somehow down here mentioned something called loot boxes which is surprising to me but
[23664.21s -> 23668.29s]  i've never really seen that term before in a 60 dollar game it's very interesting
[23669.65s -> 23672.78s]  what are you doing here what are you doing here what the fuck
[23681.34s -> 23694.26s]  uh good thing i just saved it she's mocking me i couldn't move i couldn't fucking move
[23694.98s -> 23717.41s]  i hope she's okay okay it's a good thing i saved really
[23718.54s -> 23723.94s]  that would have been pretty bad seriously jerma i could beat that
[23728.59s -> 23732.98s]  let's take care of that right off the bat because now we can predict it
[23733.70s -> 23740.94s]  watch you'll be right up my ass in a second here i told you no how did you you got in
[23740.94s -> 23755.82s]  front of me come on open hurry get in the door now i'm in the center of the clock tower

[23861.41s -> 23866.66s]  the amount of dexterity it takes to do what this person is doing
[23867.78s -> 23886.35s]  that's the hardest beat saber level i think i've ever seen i don't know if this is the
[23886.35s -> 23908.14s]  right way but i'm just gonna do it oh hi hi again it's on the ground here another

[30370.96s -> 30397.25s]  in a not at all sort of way mom we did it we did it mom am i dead what did we do
[30397.89s -> 30406.10s]  we did it i think we're in all we all made it to heaven
[30406.10s -> 30433.66s]  he got one out of 18 endings where would the other endings come from ron didn't make it
[30433.66s -> 30437.42s]  to heaven that's actually kind of unfortunate that's really bad

[30470.93s -> 30476.62s]  didn't even know he was gone ron was the reason why we were able to even win in the first
[30476.62s -> 30484.19s]  place he threw the magical lucky charm up at me without ron there is no win you don't win
[30484.99s -> 30507.09s]  i was supposed to get sacrificed to take the demon god library program all right let's see is

[30544.11s -> 30547.55s]  leave in the beginning and he wouldn't have been able to become the entity either way
[30547.55s -> 30561.92s]  since you would not be there for the sacrifice yeah clock tower three received mixed or average
[30561.92s -> 30577.81s]  reviews with an aggregate score of 69 out of 100 it was still enjoyable all right look the game
[30577.81s -> 30586.59s]  was all over the place but it was still it was a it was messy fun it was messy fun no it was

[31453.76s -> 31460.37s]  windshields they had a pinging one that you know that's not even from hey calvin somebody
[31460.37s -> 31468.53s]  made that up like that calvin doesn't like take a piss on a wall somewhere in any of those comics
[31469.09s -> 31474.70s]  somebody like did that that's not an officially licensed piece of merchandise
[31475.26s -> 31488.86s]  but thank you frody and weapon for the four dollars 31 cents uh thank you nate for the
[31488.86s -> 31495.52s]  five dollars here you're gonna finish ed ed and eddie i'm not going to i will not be

[31501.20s -> 31511.23s]  you d jack thank you uh we had 250 coming from nate again when i played the orange box on my
[31511.23s -> 31516.50s]  ps3 i don't even think it works does does tf2 still even have servers on the orange box
[31517.06s -> 31528.13s]  for like playstation the server is still up isn't this still like a crit bug in the game
[31528.13s -> 31535.70s]  that hasn't been patched since like 2008 can't you charge up a melee crit in the
[31535.70s -> 31543.86s]  orange box version on the console there's still a bunch of old vanilla bugs
[31546.22s -> 31549.82s]  but i played thousands and thousands and thousands of hours of the orange box
[31550.38s -> 31555.49s]  i will probably not be going back and playing it anytime soon or probably you know probably
[31555.49s -> 31562.02s]  never again unless there's some reason why i would play portal again i've beat that game
[31562.02s -> 31568.58s]  like three times half-life 2 i've that that game i'm not going to go back to tf2 i mean
[31568.58s -> 31572.66s]  it's still there it's still available i don't have like a reason to go back and play it
[31573.63s -> 31578.83s]  but if they do something cool or bigger or larger add some interesting things i played it like a
[31578.83s -> 31584.83s]  year and a half ago but i don't really have a reason to play them like i've already done all
[31584.83s -> 31591.55s]  these things more than once so going back and doing it again is just like hey i'm doing it
[31591.55s -> 31598.80s]  again because i don't really have a reason to do it especially something like portal or half
[31598.80s -> 31608.85s]  life so would not be playing those games probably again uh thank you the other us for
[31608.85s -> 31621.38s]  the two bucks uh-oh i'm just gonna take some getting used to but thank you i need that story
