[1.53s -> 14.52s]  Hello, good afternoon everybody. How you doing? Good to see you again. It's always good to see you.
[15.50s -> 25.70s]  So today we're going to play a game that's been highly highly recommended to me in the discord
[25.70s -> 34.79s]  channel and here. I don't know why. The game is called Frog Detective and I mean it does it the
[34.79s -> 43.29s]  frog is in the title so I have to play. I got this thing going since like 2012 where every single
[43.29s -> 48.17s]  video game with frog in the title I have to play it at some point so that's what we're doing today.
[48.89s -> 58.89s]  Does it have candy in it? I don't know. This game is only like an hour long so the other plan is
[59.61s -> 66.14s]  once we get through frog detective is we're going to do a part two of community content night.
[66.94s -> 71.40s]  Somebody told you we're going to split it into two and we're going to do it next weekend and
[71.96s -> 80.74s]  here we are. Community content night part two will be after frog detective one.
[85.32s -> 89.96s]  Let's go over those of you that weren't here a couple days ago. We talked about the schedule
[89.96s -> 98.26s]  coming up here. It's going to get a little weird. I have some old friends that have come into town
[101.03s -> 108.47s]  and they are going to be here for a week. A full week. So I've got to take some time to
[109.19s -> 112.39s]  show them around Vegas. Some of them it's their first time for being here so
[113.35s -> 122.50s]  old Boston friends coming in. On top of that I have sort of the final stretch of my
[124.18s -> 128.44s]  medical mystery that there's a couple appointments coming up this week.
[130.20s -> 137.32s]  Next week is what I mean. So it's going to be interesting but not next week like the week
[137.32s -> 143.21s]  after next. The first week of February. So there's not going to be a stream tomorrow.
[146.02s -> 153.50s]  That's where it starts but as of Tuesday we're going to start early on Tuesday. Very early
[153.50s -> 159.37s]  because I got something going on later in the evening on Tuesday. But as of Tuesday we're
[159.37s -> 164.63s]  going to go five days in a row. We're going to go Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
[166.25s -> 172.70s]  and then after that after the five day super stream you are not going to see me for at least
[172.70s -> 176.94s]  six days. That's what I'm going to be taking the week off. So I figured if I'm going to take
[177.50s -> 181.42s]  six days off I want to stream like six days in a week. You know what I'm saying?
[182.38s -> 188.33s]  I don't just want to disappear. But that's the plan. Nothing tomorrow, something today
[188.33s -> 195.45s]  and then we do five days in a row. He's never coming back after that one. What am I going to
[195.45s -> 207.99s]  do for six days? I don't know. Knit a sweater. Do a knot tying class. Go work on something cool.
[209.22s -> 216.02s]  Eat a good breakfast at least one of those days. When I'm gone I want you to eat a
[216.02s -> 222.82s]  fucking really good breakfast. I'm talking like greens, tomatoes, beans and shit. Have like a
[222.82s -> 228.02s]  full good spread and think about me while you're doing that. Be like he fucking told me to do this
[228.02s -> 235.27s]  shit. Tell me to have like the beans and tomatoes and some nice like green sauteed eggs. I want you
[235.35s -> 242.17s]  to think of me when you do that. What do you mean? What are you? Beans for breakfast?
[242.97s -> 248.92s]  Hold on a minute. What you what you guys don't what do you mean beans for breakfast? What the
[248.92s -> 257.18s]  fuck? What's wrong with you? What are you talking about? Like that's English. That's English style.
[257.18s -> 262.38s]  You guys don't have English style breakfast in England? This like 12% of my audience is from
[262.38s -> 276.33s]  England. How come I'm not seeing more yeses? England isn't real. That's an English style
[276.33s -> 283.21s]  beans, toast, eggs, tomatoes, sausages. Come on that's an English style breakfast. That's
[283.21s -> 291.32s]  what my mother used to tell me. Was she lying to me? No she wasn't. Kim says that too. I got two
[291.32s -> 298.10s]  people versus you of like 3000. Sorry guys. Anyways we're gonna play frog. Just gonna chill
[298.10s -> 301.46s]  for a little bit. Play frog detective. This has been very very highly requested. I don't know why
[301.46s -> 311.67s]  but it was. It's true. Yeah I know. Let's put it on. I don't know anything about this game. It just
[311.67s -> 316.15s]  looks kind of like a cute detective game. Just okay all the Drew crew that's here.
[316.15s -> 327.14s]  Just imagine. This is Nancy Drew's of frog now okay. Can you see it? There you go.
[329.08s -> 338.39s]  Why does every game have to have a crew? Why can't we just play video games? Why is it why is my
[338.39s -> 346.50s]  stream in my community every game is a different country? Why can't we just why do I have to have
[346.50s -> 358.81s]  a crew for every game? This game fun? I already know. Okay all right let's see. Do it. Yeah I
[358.81s -> 367.45s]  know it's gonna get spammed. Do it. Use the mouse to look around. All right super frog detective.
[369.02s -> 380.97s]  W A S D is moving around. Okay it's me. Well the phone's ringing. This is not even
[380.97s -> 394.31s]  fucking 90 FOV. Fucking refunded. Hello. Who is it? It's the supervisor. Hi supervisor. Hey how's
[394.31s -> 400.09s]  life? Yeah pretty good I reckon. How are things with you? Me and the wife just got back from
[400.09s -> 408.14s]  Indonesia. Oh well tell them I dare you to come Bali. That means welcome back I think. Thanks.
[409.29s -> 416.09s]  Anyway what are you calling about? Oh right. I have a case for you. Who? It's a pretty spooky
[416.09s -> 422.78s]  one so hold on tight. I'm holding on. It's a little sloth who owns an island just off the bay.
[423.42s -> 427.34s]  Martin's his name. Says he's been here in a ghost for about two weeks.
[428.22s -> 435.02s]  So get this. He hires a team of ghost scientists. I'm not gonna do this whole stream. What's a ghost
[435.02s -> 441.53s]  scientist? I don't know. Anyway he hires some of them right and they can't find anything.
[442.25s -> 449.10s]  They've been on the island for two weeks. Whoa! The ghost is still at large so the head scientist
[449.10s -> 454.86s]  there a monkey calls me up. They need help and they want the greatest investigator I have.
[454.86s -> 459.98s]  So I said to them I'll send my best investigator but lobster cop wasn't available. This game like
[459.98s -> 468.66s]  30 minutes. Well this is this is precious game time real estate. We're running out of time.
[468.66s -> 475.70s]  So I'm asking you the second best investigator. I fully understand lobster cop's abilities far
[475.70s -> 482.82s]  outweigh my own. Yeah but you're pretty good. So are you up for it? I don't know it sounds scary.
[482.90s -> 488.90s]  I should be very brave. I believe in you detective. That's what I need to hear. Thank you supervisor.
[490.36s -> 499.96s]  I get okay. Wahoo! Can you give me a summary of the case before I go? Auto voice. Sure thing.
[499.96s -> 504.44s]  The basics are there's a slow... wait is this kids game? How old do you have to be to play this?
[506.54s -> 510.22s]  Well okay what's this what's the cutoff ceiling for age for playing this game?
[510.22s -> 515.08s]  Because I know like there's like cute games right? Oh that's cute game for kids
[515.08s -> 519.24s]  but if you're over the age of eight like it's don't even play it right like is this one of them?
[520.60s -> 523.96s]  There's a sloth who's hearing a lot of spooky ghost noises around his island.
[523.96s -> 528.04s]  He calls a bunch of ghost scientists but they're stumped. It's up to you to solve the mystery of
[528.04s -> 534.79s]  the haunted island. Why did you just tell haunted islands at me? Because that's the title of the
[534.79s -> 543.88s]  case. Time for you to grab your magnifying glass and get going. See you later supervisor. Good
[543.88s -> 562.98s]  luck. Thanks. I'm not a cutoff age for video games if you like it Jerma. Ah yes I thought this is a
[562.98s -> 568.34s]  mirror. Ah yes my trusty magnifying glass can't solve mysteries without it. Now I can right click
[568.34s -> 577.46s]  to see up close. But I can't do the thing. I can't do the thing that they do in every single... what
[577.46s -> 584.82s]  was last time you ever you saw magnifying glass in any form of media? It wasn't this. The magnifying
[584.82s -> 593.61s]  glass is not... they don't use it anymore. Nancy Drew. No no I'm talking like I'm talking... all
[593.61s -> 597.61s]  right let me rephrase that. Media that has been consumed by more than a million people
[599.62s -> 604.18s]  right? Like when was the last time you saw? Not don't... Nancy Drew's doesn't count.
[605.46s -> 615.22s]  Sherlock Holmes. Time to solve a mystery. Do they even use magnifying glasses in Sherlock Holmes?
[616.02s -> 627.77s]  Grace Ruxner presents Super Frog. I'm gonna say that like a thousand times this stream you
[627.77s -> 649.29s]  know I am. Frog Detective Adventure. How far away does Super Frog live? This is kind of loud. I'll
[649.29s -> 668.65s]  turn it down. It's on an island starring the detective Mark, Larry, Moe the Mouse, Bernie,
[671.13s -> 686.36s]  Fresh X, and the rest. Case one. The haunted island. This is just like cutouts. Okay the haunted
[686.36s -> 700.34s]  island. I'm ready. So I have to solve the case. Do a Kermit voice. Well this is a really small
[700.34s -> 708.66s]  island. I don't think it's gonna be that hard to figure this out considering... like do you have
[708.66s -> 714.14s]  one camera that's pointed at the island? That's all I need. Just even if it's low it's not even
[714.14s -> 718.60s]  HD. Okay what do you want?
[753.78s -> 756.26s]  Of course I remember. I don't remember.
[780.76s -> 786.22s]  Who should I talk to first? You're talking to me already. Okay who should I talk to second?
[796.90s -> 807.06s]  The other way around. I'll check it out. Thanks. What would you like to know? The resident. May I
[807.06s -> 811.82s]  ask who the resident of this island is? Oh that would be Martin. You can find him hiding in the
[811.82s -> 816.94s]  forest. He thinks the ghost can't catch him there. Hmm very interesting. I'll investigate.
[817.58s -> 828.92s]  But what would you like to know? Nothing. I'll come back after I did some stuff. See you around.
[829.72s -> 846.79s]  What does it say on this thing? Hmm maybe a man in a suit. Was playing this the compromise?
[846.79s -> 860.18s]  The compromise you have with the Drew crew. What is that? Wait can I pick this up?
[860.82s -> 876.33s]  Patrick. No it's not. Okay what is it? What is this? There's cookies? Macaroni. Yum it's not mine.
[884.26s -> 889.30s]  Hey uh you're that detective right? The one that uh monkey keeps on going on about.
[890.10s -> 897.19s]  That's me. I'm so glad they finally brought someone else in. I know nothing. I really shouldn't have
[897.19s -> 905.77s]  taken the job. Why did you take it? Oh I'll be honest. I thought it was a secret agent job.
[905.77s -> 913.70s]  That's what I thought. Why would you think that? Job listing said ghost scientist. That didn't seem
[913.70s -> 925.45s]  like a real job to me. I thought it was uh like a cover you know. One that only smart people could
[925.45s -> 933.14s]  figure out like me. It still could be a cover. Maybe they're testing you. Oh no no no no you're
[933.14s -> 941.56s]  right. I better look competent. I'm only joking. Sure. Can I ask you some questions about Casey?
[943.05s -> 954.46s]  What else do you want to know? What do you know about noise coming from cows? I mean I'm not
[954.46s -> 960.78s]  great at this. I'd be good at other jobs. Just letting you know. But it does seem like the noise
[960.78s -> 967.93s]  is coming from this hole. From a natural creature. They seem to be otherworldly somehow. They have a
[967.93s -> 976.15s]  weird and distinct tongue. Sometimes it sounds like a bird's call. But only sometimes. Oh that's
[976.15s -> 985.30s]  not good information. Yes I'm very good at finding things out. If you know what I mean. Bernie I'm
[985.30s -> 996.18s]  not a secret agent. Uh-huh. What else do you want to know? He's not paying attention beyond the
[996.18s -> 1002.74s]  impression. Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding we figured it out. I'm not paying
[1002.74s -> 1008.18s]  attention to the story at all. I'm just making sure that I sound like Bernie Sanders.
[1008.98s -> 1012.42s]  That's it. That's all I cared about. I don't know anything. I don't even know what he just said.
[1014.63s -> 1026.04s]  I have no idea what's happening right now. Okay let's let's pay attention. Let me let me figure
[1026.04s -> 1034.95s]  this out. About the hole. And this too. This is making me dumb. This is making me. I'm thinking
[1034.95s -> 1039.91s]  dumb. You know what you think about noise coming from cows? Like I'm not even processing that
[1039.91s -> 1049.64s]  information. It's just I'm losing IQ points when I do detectives. Frog detectives. Okay here we go.
[1050.79s -> 1059.18s]  What do you know about the noises coming from this hole? I mean I'm not great at this. But I'd be
[1059.18s -> 1064.52s]  good at some other stuff. Just letting you know I don't have a problem with you. It just seems like
[1064.52s -> 1068.44s]  the noise is coming from the hole. I'm from a natural creature. I know all kinds of creatures
[1068.44s -> 1076.15s]  in my life. They seem otherworldly somehow. They were weird. All right. All right. I have to pay
[1076.15s -> 1084.54s]  attention. No more voices. We're done. Birds call. Only sometimes. Okay birds call. Do Obama?
[1086.46s -> 1097.91s]  I'm not sure that I can. I'm willing to give it a try. On the next film. Wait wait wait.
[1103.88s -> 1106.84s]  All right. Why do you want to be a secret agent? Secret agents get the best stuff.
[1107.56s -> 1110.44s]  Like for example you've got a cool magnifying glass. I want one of those.
[1111.08s -> 1126.15s]  Okay. Sure you're not. Yeah. Bernie Winks. Hey. Oh hey hey. Look at me. Look at. Even if I can't be
[1126.15s -> 1133.51s]  secret agent. Things I give up. I would love a magnifying glass. All right. There's nothing
[1133.51s -> 1140.60s]  I want more. You want a magnifying glass. You just give them mine. All right. Nothing. That's it.
[1141.32s -> 1146.68s]  I was saving my points for that. But now you can save them for something else.
[1147.40s -> 1151.88s]  Like making one of my emotes black and white. Which just makes it harder to see.
[1153.34s -> 1170.18s]  Thanks for the channel points. Hey. It's me Larry. Hey. I did not do it.
[1171.98s -> 1181.88s]  Huh? The noises are not coming from me. I didn't. I Larry did not make these spooky noises.
[1183.08s -> 1191.13s]  That's suspicious. What? Are you even listening to me? I said I didn't make those noises.
[1192.23s -> 1197.50s]  No I heard. I just. I don't like being accused like this. I'm not. Oh you're not accusing me?
[1198.06s -> 1208.68s]  That's such a relief. Can I. Are you going to ask me a question? Yeah ask me the questions I
[1208.68s -> 1217.78s]  mean. What can you tell me about the noises? Firstly I am not the one making them. I'm not
[1217.78s -> 1228.38s]  making the noises. Yeah. But I know where they're coming from. What? They're coming from the cave
[1228.38s -> 1236.28s]  in the forest. Why haven't you told anybody? Nobody listens to me. They say stuff like well
[1236.28s -> 1243.46s]  Larry if you won't listen to us we won't listen to you. Which is so weird because I do listen.
[1245.05s -> 1250.90s]  Maybe they. I'm a really great listener. So how do we get into the. This is just evil Bernie.
[1252.84s -> 1266.06s]  Evil Bernie Sanders. How do we get into the cave? Well I need a few things. To get through there
[1266.06s -> 1272.49s]  you'll need some sort of explosive device. Is that safe? We're dealing with ghosts here detective.
[1272.49s -> 1277.78s]  None of this is safe. Anyway I'll need a few things. I looked up an explosive recipe in one
[1277.78s -> 1283.46s]  of the old chemistry books. I need toothpaste, some wool, a chunk of pure gold and some pasta.
[1284.02s -> 1291.21s]  Oh so the normal explosive ingredient. There's a standard explosive recipe. Yes.
[1291.93s -> 1296.98s]  You want to get into that cave? Bring me those ingredients. I'll do my best.
[1298.42s -> 1309.13s]  Ask me then the question now. You have to do a. I'll try. Not next. Let's make some dynamite.
[1309.77s -> 1317.53s]  Not yet detective. We still need toothpaste, some wool, a chunk of pure gold and some pasta.
[1318.09s -> 1325.85s]  Okay. All right. I need. So I need. Oh yeah. So give me that. How do I get that pasta?
[1328.78s -> 1352.15s]  I need this. Yum. It's not mine. Take it. What are you doing? Howdy. What are you doing in there?
[1354.22s -> 1363.67s]  But there's a storm. It's not raining yet. Besides it's not actually that unsafe
[1363.67s -> 1372.14s]  to swim in the storm. Everyone keeps telling me to get out of the sea. But it's safer in here
[1372.70s -> 1384.15s]  and it is up there. Why is that? No ghosts in the water. Ghosts can't swim. How do you know?
[1384.95s -> 1398.22s]  Uh, Martin said you don't look happy in there. I guess I'm not. Sorry to hear. Thanks.
[1398.94s -> 1413.14s]  Ask you why you're so sad. Well, it's kind of silly. I really want a magnet. I told you it's silly.
[1415.11s -> 1425.93s]  Why do you want a magnet? Well, go on. My dream is to attach a magnet to a boat and, uh, hold on.
[1427.42s -> 1438.36s]  Oh, why? Boats are fast. I'm not fast. I hold on to the magnet. I'll be really fast too. Nice.
[1440.04s -> 1448.70s]  Right. I don't have any idea where to find one though. And even if I did, there's, there's no way
[1448.70s -> 1457.58s]  I'm getting out of that water here to that ghost is found. That's interesting. Is there anything
[1457.58s -> 1471.03s]  you need to know? All right. Let's process information now. Time to process info. All right.
[1471.03s -> 1474.47s]  Why did you want the magnet? So I can attach it to the back of a boat and zoom along. All right.
[1474.47s -> 1478.55s]  So you want a magnet so you can zoom along. Okay. If it's sweetens it, I can give you this big shell
[1478.55s -> 1484.90s]  in return for a magnet. I thought it might be magnetic, but it's not. Let's process info for
[1484.90s -> 1489.86s]  this like kids game that I'm not going to be able to complete because I'm doing, I'm doing like
[1489.86s -> 1499.58s]  precedents and presidential candidates. Oh no. God damn it. Okay. How was I supposed to know?
[1499.58s -> 1506.36s]  What am I? Scientist. Okay. Is there anything else you need to know? All right. We need to get a
[1506.36s -> 1517.35s]  magnet so we get the shell. We need a magnet so we can get the shell. We need pasta to get the
[1517.35s -> 1527.42s]  bomb. We need a magnet to get the shell. There's so many, there's a million people here. All right.
[1527.42s -> 1538.71s]  What is this? Is that a magnifying glass? Stop right there. Stop it. Stop right there. Why?
[1540.78s -> 1549.16s]  My shells. My shells. Don't step on my shells please. Oh, I won't. We can't be sure of that.
[1550.74s -> 1561.51s]  I guess not. They're very fragile and very small. Be careful. Aren't we all? I get, please just,
[1561.51s -> 1569.94s]  please be careful. Don't touch them. Don't step on them. Okay. You're still going to stand like that?
[1571.88s -> 1584.49s]  Yeah. Why? I'm alarmed. I'm on alert. I am protecting my shells from dangerous feet.
[1587.35s -> 1596.95s]  Wow. Sorry. I just worked up about my shells. I don't mean to be rude, but what shells?
[1597.75s -> 1606.30s]  I can't see any shells. That's because they're small. But me, very large. I have very big hands.
[1608.14s -> 1615.70s]  Shells are small. Hands enormous. How small? Too small for your weak magnifying glass.
[1617.86s -> 1622.66s]  Wow. So I'm sorry. It's the truth. It's the truth. It's just the truth.
[1623.46s -> 1627.10s]  I had to get this one specifically made for my tiny shells.
[1629.29s -> 1638.79s]  Fine. Can I ask you some questions? Ask me questions. Just be careful. Don't touch them.
[1638.79s -> 1644.82s]  Don't get near them. I will one. No, no, not you. No, no, no, no. You're from the fake news.
[1645.46s -> 1654.86s]  Somebody else, please. Me? Okay. Why don't you just get a bigger shell?
[1655.34s -> 1669.56s]  Ha. You fool. Hey. Hey. Sorry. It's just that there's not many big shells around here.
[1672.52s -> 1676.52s]  If I could get one shell. We got to get the shell to get the magnifying glass to get the pasta.
[1677.32s -> 1683.77s]  All right. We need shell. We need magnet to get shell to get magnifying glass. Okay.
[1685.58s -> 1689.91s]  Okay. All right. All right. Ask me questions. We got it. We got it. We got it. What about that
[1689.91s -> 1705.38s]  cave? This guy's a partisan streamer. Do you know anything about that cave? Oh, what? No.
[1707.62s -> 1715.26s]  No, I don't know. It might not. It could be a cave. It might not be a cave. It couldn't. It
[1715.26s -> 1719.98s]  might just be a small dark place. That doesn't need to be a cave. Who knows? Could be anything.
[1720.62s -> 1729.46s]  Looks like a pile of rock. There's a cave. Well, I guess we'll agree to disagree.
[1731.37s -> 1736.57s]  It's literally a confirmed cave. A potato, potato. You know, you do, you add to me.
[1738.36s -> 1744.36s]  Okay. Let's make sure we, let's make sure we do Trump correctly. The only way I'm telling,
[1744.36s -> 1751.00s]  listen to me. The cam has to go on for this because Donald Trump is one of the only voices
[1751.00s -> 1755.88s]  where you have to actually move around. Like I am. Okay. Like my hands come up in the air like
[1755.88s -> 1759.88s]  this and cross like this and I close my fingers. I don't know. I just that you have to move around.
[1760.84s -> 1768.10s]  I, I'm very, and I'm very limited. Like I, I, this doesn't do anything, but I don't know why
[1768.10s -> 1779.85s]  you just have to do it. You're a gobbler. Get out of here. Okay. Really? Yeah. Fair enough.
[1781.11s -> 1788.55s]  Ask me questions. Just be careful. I changed this one halfway through. Now it's somebody else.
[1789.90s -> 1796.79s]  Okay. I haven't paid attention to anything. Now I know. Okay. All right. All right. All right.
[1796.79s -> 1804.22s]  Right. What's the first step though? What's the first item we need magnet? Oh God. We need
[1804.22s -> 1810.71s]  potion. We need potion to get shell, to get magnet, to get boat, to get fucking pasta, to get.
[1810.71s -> 1834.44s]  All right. Let's, we gotta get for the first one. Hi. Hello. You okay? Yeah. Are you sure? Well,
[1834.44s -> 1840.89s]  I have just never talked to a detective before. I've heard so many nice things about you.
[1841.61s -> 1852.49s]  I don't want to be embarrassing. If I am embarrassing, that would be very bad.
[1853.37s -> 1856.55s]  You're not embarrassing. That's very good news.
[1861.18s -> 1871.40s]  The conversation isn't over. There's still time. I have to be careful. Oh, well, it's okay. If I
[1871.40s -> 1884.02s]  ask you some questions. You have questions for me? Questions, yes. You seem very nervous. Why?
[1885.66s -> 1895.80s]  Oh, because of the detective thing. I told you. I'm afraid of detectives. Maybe when I was a kid,
[1895.80s -> 1901.93s]  I had a bad dream about a detective. Something like that. I don't know. Sorry to hear about your
[1901.93s -> 1915.88s]  dream. What? What? What? No, it's because this is close. I know why people are fucking mad right
[1915.88s -> 1923.40s]  now. Because this is getting really close to the thing that everybody fucking hates. I know. And
[1923.40s -> 1936.44s]  now everyone's like, no, don't shut up. Hey, I'm available. And you can feel and you're like, no,
[1936.44s -> 1943.72s]  no, no, no, no. If he says, if he says this with this voice, and he says an A and then a Y followed
[1943.72s -> 1957.72s]  by an A followed by a Y followed by a second A, I'm going to leave the stream. All right, fine.
[1958.52s -> 1962.36s]  Eric, I didn't have a dream about that. Why are you afraid of me?
[1969.11s -> 1978.66s]  Sorry about that. Fine. You've worn me down. Damn your extreme detective skills. I'm nervous
[1978.66s -> 1985.16s]  because of Mystery Monkey. Mystery Monkey is a huge fan of your blog, so I don't want to make
[1985.16s -> 1991.08s]  a fool of myself in front of you. I just think Mystery Monkey is super neat. I don't want to
[1991.08s -> 2000.28s]  be embarrassing in a case I mess up everything. Oh, well, is there anything I can do to help you?
[2002.60s -> 2007.72s]  There's a dance competition coming up tomorrow. I want to compete and show Mystery Monkey that
[2007.72s -> 2013.22s]  I'm really good at dancing, but I don't know what style of dance will impress them.
[2013.94s -> 2022.17s]  Would you ask Mystery Monkey and find out for me? I can give you this mouse wash mouth wash in return.
[2022.73s -> 2031.30s]  Sure. Questions, yes. I'll take them. The cream of the crop. The cream of the crop.
[2034.22s -> 2036.22s]  If you could do me just one favor, man.
[2037.02s -> 2042.92s]  Fucking God damn it. All right. That bottle, what do you got in there? What's in the bottle next to
[2042.92s -> 2046.68s]  you? That's my mouth wash. Give it to me. I'm having to give you to find out what type of dance
[2046.68s -> 2056.15s]  style. All right, we're going to go Mystery Monkey. Okay, do it in Randy Savage is one of those voices
[2056.15s -> 2065.27s]  that if you go all out and you really go on, you really your voice will be hurt and pain for three
[2065.27s -> 2073.38s]  days after you do it. Guaranteed. I don't know how he did that so often. He must have had a voice
[2073.38s -> 2081.29s]  made out of his vocal cords are probably made out of fucking iron. Like it's just so much pressure
[2081.29s -> 2087.70s]  coming out of your throat at the same time. So much pressure. That was a fucking legend.
[2088.18s -> 2095.77s]  All right. All right. All right. We need to go. Dude, we got to talk to the monkey. I'll come back.
[2095.77s -> 2099.53s]  I'm getting that bottle. This is supposed to take 30 minutes to beat this game. I've already beaten
[2099.53s -> 2114.09s]  the game once. All right. Where's you? What kind of dance do you like? I forgot his voice.
[2115.13s -> 2120.36s]  Questions, yes. What would you like to know? What is your favorite dance style?
[2121.00s -> 2137.26s]  Hey, so you you like dancing and dance styles? I don't understand. I like dancing a lot if that's
[2137.26s -> 2143.51s]  what you're asking. Yeah, kind of. What type of dancing do you like the most out of all dancing?
[2145.14s -> 2152.14s]  Well, I basically have one move. Yeah, but yeah, if you saw someone dancing, what scenario would
[2152.14s -> 2159.13s]  you most likely be? This is such a good dance to me. What? I guess what I'm trying to ask is
[2159.13s -> 2165.29s]  what dance style do you like the best? I have to pay attention. I think break dancing is so neat.
[2165.29s -> 2170.49s]  If I saw someone break dancing, wow, I would swoon. I would even go so far to say if I saw.
[2170.49s -> 2178.98s]  I did Randy Savage for one second and like it hurts. I did it for one second. It's all right.
[2178.98s -> 2182.66s]  I can't do any more voices with the rest of the screen. I'd be deeply impressed myself
[2182.66s -> 2187.30s]  if somebody breakdanced that I would want to hang out with them at all times forever. That's great.
[2188.02s -> 2196.98s]  I got look, I got a lot of proven that could be whiskey, but it's not. It's water that's been
[2196.98s -> 2205.67s]  poured over coffee beans and then drained into a glass. Still water, technically. All right. Sorry,
[2205.67s -> 2209.03s]  touch change question. That's OK. I'm not sure it's important to the case. All right. So now
[2209.03s -> 2218.30s]  let's go get the mouthwash. Got a monkey fact. Thanks for injuring yourself at the beginning
[2218.30s -> 2223.69s]  of the stream. I feel like I've done that like five times already. I've hurt myself
[2225.05s -> 2235.16s]  during a stream and I'm just like, well, ouch, see you in six hours. Oh, a broom.
[2236.25s -> 2253.32s]  Got a broom. All right. So what? Look, it's you. Can I pick it up? All right. Here we go.
[2253.32s -> 2265.90s]  I want that mouthwash. We have some questions. Questions. Yes. I'm going to do a fake Randy
[2265.90s -> 2273.78s]  Savage. Hey, I talked to Mystery Monkey. Oh, my gosh. Did you mention me? What did Mystery Monkey
[2273.78s -> 2283.91s]  say? Does Mystery Monkey hate me? So embarrassed. I didn't mention you. That's just Joel. Yeah.
[2283.91s -> 2289.83s]  Doesn't Joel do a really good? This is just a bad Joel. He does like a perfect Randy Savage.
[2289.83s -> 2298.71s]  I could never compare. Yeah, I couldn't. Mystery Monkey likes breakdancing the best.
[2301.94s -> 2315.78s]  Joel basically is Randy Savage. That's fucking funny. Breakdancing? I think I could do that.
[2315.78s -> 2323.53s]  I got to start practicing now, though. Good luck. Thanks. Oh, here's the mouthwash before I forget.
[2324.86s -> 2330.07s]  Cheers. All right. Got the mouthwash. Now what the hell do we need to do with this?
[2330.07s -> 2352.98s]  Oh, dude, fucking stream is going to be bopping real soon. It even looks like the same character.
[2353.62s -> 2360.17s]  That's what's fucked up. Somebody link that gif. This is the same character. It's the same dance
[2360.17s -> 2374.54s]  and it's the same person. So I need Char. We haven't talked to you. Who are you?
[2378.06s -> 2386.30s]  Who are you? Who are you? I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Frog Detective. Oh, okay. Don't sneak
[2386.30s -> 2394.15s]  up on me like that. I was visible for the entire approach. Well, fine. I guess I just don't look
[2394.15s -> 2405.08s]  so smirky. Okay, I'll do my best. Sorry, I'm so cranky. I haven't slept in two weeks. I'm Martin,
[2405.08s -> 2413.46s]  king of the island. You're a king? Well, when I got here, there was nobody else on the island
[2413.46s -> 2425.48s]  except for me and Finley. So I thought I was fine to declare myself as king. Finley? I don't think
[2425.48s -> 2429.88s]  Finley cares about that sort of stuff. Finley mostly cares about the dance competition.
[2432.55s -> 2443.64s]  No, I meant to ask who's Finley. Oh, okay then. Can I ask you a few questions?
[2445.70s -> 2457.18s]  Go ahead. Not questions for me. Dance competition. You mentioned dance competition. Can you tell me
[2457.18s -> 2464.89s]  a little more about that than you said? It's tomorrow. Anything else? Oh, the best dancer wins.
[2465.53s -> 2472.97s]  Okay. You got questions for me? This accent's changing every fucking half second. I'm being
[2473.05s -> 2479.22s]  ripped through like portals. I'm being ripped through like accent portals. I can't pick one.
[2480.70s -> 2488.58s]  He's moving from country to country to country. Who's Finley? Someone's playing with the slider.
[2489.30s -> 2497.51s]  Yeah. You mentioned your friend Finley. Who's that guy? Finley lives on an hippie island and
[2497.51s -> 2504.70s]  comes to visit me every few days. The last time I saw Finley, she was talking about this song.
[2504.70s -> 2511.58s]  She wanted to dance to her day competition. Her moves were pretty amazing. Not like me.
[2511.58s -> 2518.25s]  She'll probably win. I haven't seen her in a while, but she's probably still prepping for
[2519.13s -> 2525.53s]  the competition. It is tomorrow. Not that I'll be in to complain to her with what the hell's
[2525.53s -> 2541.58s]  broken situation going on. Got questions for me? What about the noises? Can you tell me about the
[2541.58s -> 2554.14s]  noises and where they come from? I'm not exactly sure where they come from, but I know they're
[2554.14s -> 2568.41s]  coming from a ghost. How do you know for sure? I have a book about ghosts. It's called The Ghost
[2568.41s -> 2574.79s]  Guide, Food-Proof Ways to Detect a Spirit. I've read most of it. Anyway, in the book it says
[2574.79s -> 2591.29s]  that most ghosts can't be seen. Get this? I haven't seen a single one yet. The proof is all there.
[2592.76s -> 2601.46s]  Got questions for me? The American accent is seriously like, do you have questions for me?
[2601.46s -> 2608.17s]  You got questions for me? You got questions for me? You have questions for me? You guys have seen
[2608.17s -> 2614.09s]  that video? It's one of my favorite videos. It's a dictionary talking about accents.
[2616.17s -> 2622.33s]  On some websites you can have a definition of a word, right? It's stand. You guys have seen this
[2622.33s -> 2630.94s]  video? Stand versus stand. British versus American. I've told this already. There's a lot of new people
[2630.94s -> 2637.82s]  here. There's a website where you can place different accents for different words. One of
[2637.82s -> 2645.46s]  the words is stand. The person clicks on the English speaking version of it and it's like
[2645.54s -> 2651.78s]  stand. And then they click on the just American English and it goes stand.
[2654.82s -> 2665.66s]  It sounds like so bad. Stunned. Stunned. Did you find it? You found it. Good. Yeah.
[2669.48s -> 2673.46s]  It's like just one of them just sounds so elegant and the other one's just like,
[2674.26s -> 2696.89s]  whatever. Read the YouTube comments? Stand. Stand.
[2708.57s -> 2713.85s]  It's funny every time, man. I haven't seen this video in a while. It's funny every time.
[2720.10s -> 2738.14s]  Stand. Stand. One more time. One more time. We'll move on. Stand. Stand. What is the only
[2738.46s -> 2765.64s]  comment? But yeah, that's like, that's so funny. One year ago, a year ago. Yeah,
[2766.44s -> 2770.84s]  we've talked about this is one of my favorite YouTube videos. Just having 82,000 views
[2771.96s -> 2776.84s]  is just, it's criminal. This should not be, this should be at like 820 million views.
[2778.25s -> 2788.36s]  I think I, yeah, I showed you guys this like a year ago, but you know, I thought your favorite
[2788.36s -> 2794.20s]  video was the hog calling contest. It's changed a little bit over the years. It's changed a little
[2794.20s -> 2815.69s]  bit. Wait, hold on. That's a re-upload. Oh, well, whatever. All right. What about your nerves?
[2816.41s -> 2823.86s]  You seem super nervous. Is there something I can do to help you? It's just the ghost getting me
[2823.86s -> 2831.61s]  down. I haven't been able to sleep. Kind of annoyed too, because I usually love hearing
[2831.61s -> 2838.73s]  stories about ghosts. Read all about them on the cyberweb.com. But now, I'm living one.
[2839.67s -> 2843.75s]  I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of things. Bottom of the grave more like a...
[2845.21s -> 2852.09s]  What? That made more sense in my head. I guess I mean like we'll probably die before the mystery
[2852.09s -> 2861.75s]  is solved. That's pretty dark. Dark, just like the conclusion of this tale. Sorry if I'm being
[2861.75s -> 2867.69s]  dramatic. You know I'm a good detective, right? I've solved every case I've taken on,
[2868.33s -> 2872.73s]  except the mystery of how to put on a hat. I don't like hats. My head is a strange shape.
[2873.90s -> 2880.57s]  It really is. The point is, you're safe. I'm going to find the culprit. The best thing you
[2880.57s -> 2887.08s]  can do is sit and wait. Everything will be okay. I don't feel okay. I'm finding it hard to calm
[2887.08s -> 2894.41s]  down. I understand ghosts are scary, but there might not be a ghost. You really think it's not
[2894.41s -> 2904.30s]  a ghost? I don't know for sure. Oh. Let's try a visualization exercise. What's a visualization...
[2905.58s -> 2912.38s]  Exorcism? It's a thing where we pretend. Imagine you're on a beach surrounded by calming waves.
[2913.18s -> 2919.27s]  You can feel cool breeze on your face. The waves slowly move in and then out. It's a safe beach.
[2920.28s -> 2927.32s]  What beach is it? This beach. This isn't a safe beach. There's a ghost here.
[2928.68s -> 2939.02s]  No, the ghost is on holiday. Oh, okay. Where is it? On a road trip. Cool. Can we visualize
[2939.02s -> 2947.38s]  that we're on a road trip instead? But the ghost is on the road trip. Great point. Continue.
[2949.13s -> 2954.02s]  Anyway, the waves are coming in and out slowly. There's nothing to worry about.
[2954.02s -> 2962.23s]  No ghosts around at all. The ghost is on a road trip? Yep. Nothing to fear. A nice sandy beach.
[2963.11s -> 2980.17s]  Just me in the ocean. How do you feel? So relaxed. Great. Me too. Thanks so much, detective.
[2982.54s -> 2995.13s]  That's okay. I want to give you something as thanks. Perhaps a piece of my crown. A chunk of pure
[2995.13s -> 3003.05s]  gold. Wow, that's so kind. It's really heavy. It better be. It's made out of pure gold, man.
[3004.76s -> 3025.58s]  Why? I like gold. Okay. Got questions for me? What? Weirdly, weird sexual voice?
[3026.22s -> 3031.38s]  What are you talking about? That's half the fucking sounds you heard on the radio.
[3032.26s -> 3045.86s]  All right, I got a pure gold. Okay, what? I got this potion. I mean, he doesn't know. Remember,
[3045.86s -> 3051.64s]  do not split up when searching for ghosts like Scooby-Doo. Who took my sunglasses? Give them back.
[3052.60s -> 3066.17s]  That's me. I did that. Cool. Note, some fall noises need some tomatoes or soup. Who is ghost?
[3066.17s -> 3075.29s]  I'm not qualified. This might come in handy. Got a magnet. Oh, that was easy. That was really easy.
[3075.29s -> 3078.57s]  That was super easy. That was the easiest thing I've done all day. I got the magnet. Okay.
[3080.81s -> 3085.80s]  Science line, don't go in. Okay. What are you going to do? Fucking kill me?
[3089.86s -> 3099.53s]  Hmm. I should have listened to the sign. All right, we got a magnet.
[3101.22s -> 3112.07s]  We got a magnet? Okay. Always with the question. Is there anything you need to know?
[3112.71s -> 3127.67s]  I got a magnet. I brought you a magnet. What? A real one? Are you for real? Yes. This is a
[3127.67s -> 3135.02s]  dream come true. Thank you so much. No problem. In return, I'll give you this big shell.
[3135.74s -> 3146.42s]  I don't need it anyway. Great. Thanks. Wow. A real magnet. All right. Now we take the shell
[3147.30s -> 3168.50s]  and we go over here. I think this needs a new voice. Always. Always asking questions.
[3169.46s -> 3177.18s]  Ask me questions. Just be careful. I have a big shell if you want one.
[3179.74s -> 3186.54s]  How did you do this? Somebody? How did you do that? It's a long story. Oh, in that case,
[3186.62s -> 3193.96s]  I don't care. Just give me the shell. Don't care. I hate stories, especially long ones.
[3195.51s -> 3203.38s]  Okay. Anyway, I totally want the shell. Can I swap you for the shell? Very quickly.
[3205.03s -> 3214.22s]  I have this magnifying glass. Look at the tiny shells. They're very small. I won't need it now
[3214.22s -> 3224.79s]  that I have this big shell. Cool. Thanks. You're still standing weird. I'm still on alert.
[3225.59s -> 3237.51s]  Here's the magnifying glass. Now get out of here. Wow. What a crowd. Biggest crowd anyone's ever
[3237.51s -> 3251.61s]  seen. And then we go over here. Who wanted the magnifying glass? You did. I've got something for
[3251.61s -> 3261.35s]  you. Best deal in the history of all magnifying glasses. Every magnifying glass. It's the best
[3261.35s -> 3270.06s]  deal ever. Just sometimes. Do we have a voice? Oh yeah. Questions. Questions. Questions. What else
[3270.06s -> 3281.19s]  do you want to know? I have a spare magnifying glass if you want one. Interested? Are you kidding
[3281.19s -> 3290.92s]  me? There's very little, there's nothing I want more. Here you go. This is the best day ever.
[3290.92s -> 3298.36s]  All of my dreams are coming true. We got Medicare for all. We got magnifying glasses. And remember,
[3298.36s -> 3308.63s]  I was the first one that put forth the magnifying glass bill of 1981. Best day ever. Is there
[3308.63s -> 3315.29s]  anything I can do to repay you? Do you need any help with your secret agent business? I'm not a
[3315.29s -> 3325.05s]  secret agent. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. I can give you my lunch. Oh, what you cooking? Pasta as always.
[3325.69s -> 3332.09s]  I always eat as cheap as I can. A little bit of olive oil on your pasta. That's all you need.
[3332.09s -> 3342.14s]  Some of these people put tomato sauce on their pasta. Too much. Too expensive. Pasta is all.
[3342.14s -> 3350.84s]  If there's one thing I love apart from a thrill of secrecy is pasta. Anyway, my appetite is
[3350.84s -> 3359.64s]  satiated from the deliciousness of this magnifying glass. That's a weird way to word that. Whatever.
[3359.64s -> 3372.09s]  You like my pasta or what? Yay. It's all yours. All right. What do we need? All right. We have,
[3372.09s -> 3375.69s]  we need one. Wait, wait, wait. Is this enough? I think we have everything. I forget. Oh yeah.
[3375.69s -> 3381.13s]  Right. It's evil. A little more evil. More questions. Ask me them. The questions I read.
[3381.13s -> 3386.68s]  What else is new? Didn't you list the ingredients for the explosive device?
[3387.32s -> 3396.04s]  Toothpaste, some wool, a chunk of pure gold, and some pasta. Ask me the questions I read.
[3399.22s -> 3409.78s]  We need wool. How do I get wool? Larry David and Bernie Sanders are the same person.
[3413.67s -> 3418.95s]  Didn't they like meet and they just kind of started going like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[3418.95s -> 3421.11s]  They just like kind of were yelling at each other for like a minute or two.
[3425.99s -> 3431.91s]  I fucking love Larry David. If you've never seen Curb Your Enthusiasm,
[3432.94s -> 3441.14s]  just do, just what are you doing? Like do it. What are you doing? All right. So what, what now?
[3441.14s -> 3457.32s]  I need, oh, you got wool right here. Hey, how's it hanging? Fine. I guess bored mostly.
[3459.27s -> 3466.79s]  Why are you bored? That's suspicious. Suspicious? Why? Surely you can't just say I'm suspicious.
[3469.11s -> 3477.85s]  There's no rule against it. I'm not being suspicious at all. I guess not. Sorry for calling
[3477.85s -> 3485.21s]  you suspicious. That's okay. Why are you bored? Isn't hunting ghosts supposed to be exciting?
[3485.93s -> 3490.65s]  For the first week? Sure. Not now though. I've been at this post the entire time.
[3491.53s -> 3498.54s]  I'm shedding everywhere. Gross. I know. You mind if I ask you a few questions?
[3499.62s -> 3510.38s]  Ask away. Shitting? Why are you shitting so much? I haven't had a trim in ages. It's just so yuck.
[3511.18s -> 3516.30s]  Split ends everywhere. I'm usually getting cut once a week, but it's been two weeks now.
[3517.34s -> 3525.00s]  Yuck. It's so gross. It's totally fine. Thanks for trying to spare my feelings. There is wool
[3525.00s -> 3534.73s]  everywhere. I think everyone is so grossed out by it. Surely that's not true. Maybe not,
[3534.73s -> 3543.29s]  but it feels true in my heart. I think most people like wool. Used for so much stuff. Like what?
[3544.33s -> 3553.85s]  My jumper is made out of wool. Wait, are you for real? Yes. That's weird. It's weird that
[3553.85s -> 3560.90s]  you're wearing my hair. Wool is pretty gross too. That's why I keep mine short. I don't think wool
[3560.90s -> 3571.22s]  is gross at all. Okay, but what if I wore a coat made of your slime? What? Ew. Gross, right? Sure,
[3571.22s -> 3575.62s]  but slime is kind of gross anyway. And I'm not saying that as someone who is very slimy.
[3576.34s -> 3583.53s]  I am saying that. Wool is worn by most people. It's the first time I've heard someone wearing
[3583.53s -> 3589.38s]  a wool. I think that makes you the weird one. Plus, I'm pretty sure the shirt you were wearing
[3589.38s -> 3602.92s]  is wool. Wait, wait. What? I'm wearing another sheep's hair? I'm pretty sure, yeah. Gross.
[3604.54s -> 3609.18s]  I'm happy to take your wool away from you if you'd like. I mean, your own wool is not whatever.
[3610.49s -> 3616.57s]  Oh, yes, please. You'll need something to clean it up with. Like a broom or a fire or something.
[3617.37s -> 3624.02s]  Okay, cool. I probably won't use fire. Okay. I can't believe I'm wearing wool.
[3624.82s -> 3630.14s]  What if it's Barney's? What if I ask you some more questions?
[3631.53s -> 3638.66s]  Can I ask away? Hey, I got that broom. Ready to clean?
[3640.15s -> 3648.20s]  Yeah, it's amazing. Thanks, detective. Can I keep this broom? Absolutely. Can I keep your wool?
[3650.82s -> 3659.00s]  It's still weird, but yeah, knock yourself out. What? I mean, like, take all the wool you want,
[3660.28s -> 3669.18s]  not physically knock yourself out. Are you stupid? Phew. All right, I'm ready.
[3674.86s -> 3693.51s]  Is this the Witcher? All right, here we go. Four questions. Ask me them the questions I mean,
[3693.51s -> 3700.47s]  those ones. Can you list the ingredients one more time? Toothpaste, wool,
[3701.53s -> 3712.42s]  chunk of gold, and some pasta. Thanks. Do I not have toothpaste? Wait, that doesn't count?
[3713.14s -> 3726.94s]  That's mouthwash. Where would I get toothpaste? There's more. Wait, bug. There's a bug. Oh,
[3726.94s -> 3755.18s]  wait a minute. Holy shit. There's a small enemy spider. Howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy,
[3755.18s -> 3763.83s]  howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy.
[3763.83s -> 3777.78s]  Yep. Right. You brought my toothpaste shipment? No, I'm the detective. Oh, okay. Can I call you
[3777.78s -> 3793.53s]  T-D-T-T-T-TEC or whatever? Yes. Nice. I have some questions. Is that okay?
[3794.33s -> 3803.02s]  Take it away, detective. Why aren't you wearing a lab coat like the other scientists?
[3804.09s -> 3810.17s]  It's my day off. I've been working so hard for the last two weeks. It's very important to take a
[3810.17s -> 3819.14s]  break and get some sun. You're right. Not about the sun, but taking day off. Yeah, I didn't
[3819.14s -> 3825.99s]  pick a great day for it. Sorry to question you on your day off. Take it away, detective.
[3829.48s -> 3840.30s]  Well, I'll tell you something. Arthur, hope you don't mind me saying, but you have wonderful teeth.
[3840.86s -> 3850.26s]  Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'm so glad someone finally noticed. How do you keep them so pearly,
[3850.26s -> 3856.98s]  White? Which Dr. Tight Smile's 101 tooth whitening cool paste for teeth, of course.
[3858.50s -> 3864.33s]  Dr. Tight Smile's 101 tooth whitening cool paste for teeth. I get a shipment here every three days.
[3864.33s -> 3873.24s]  I go through the stuff so quickly. I'm down to my last tube. Well, where can I get some of my own
[3873.24s -> 3885.03s]  toothpaste? Do you have teeth? Well, I could give you my tube, but I would need something
[3885.03s -> 3890.09s]  else to keep my mouth fresh. I think about it. Can I ask you some of these questions?
[3890.98s -> 3899.18s]  Take it away, detective. Mouthwash. I have some mouthwash for you. Amazing. Thanks.
[3899.74s -> 3908.60s]  Am I able to use your toothpaste now? I almost forgot. Here you go, detective. Take it. Do
[3908.60s -> 3920.81s]  what you will with it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's
[3920.81s -> 3930.30s]  go. Let's go. More questions. Ask me the questions, I mean. I've slowed down a little. I'm trying to
[3930.30s -> 3935.34s]  be more like my friend over here on the other side. He's a little more toned down than me.
[3935.34s -> 3948.07s]  I'm trying to be more like him. Let's make some dynamite. Let's see. Oh, you got everything.
[3949.45s -> 3963.69s]  Yep. Amazing. Shall we make some dynamite? Yes. Let's do it. Nice. I'll cook up some
[3963.69s -> 3980.33s]  dynamite and we can get exploding, baby. Punished Bernie. Well, this is it. Yep. Time to blow this
[3980.33s -> 3991.43s]  cave up. Larry, explosives are dangerous. Sorry. Time to carefully blow this cave up. Thank you.
[3992.31s -> 3999.80s]  No worries. I'm nervous. Me too. And I'm not even coming into the cave. You're not?
[4000.44s -> 4009.05s]  I don't like dark spaces. I'm a sunny boy, baby. I'm not a baby. Sorry. Anyway, good luck.
[4009.86s -> 4026.42s]  Look after yourself in there. Thanks, Larry. Let's do it. That's like super animated. I'm surprised
[4026.42s -> 4039.21s]  that was like fully animated. Everyone is Bernie. Oh, let me just tell you something. Okay. Oh,
[4039.21s -> 4048.50s]  my pasta. My pasta. I got pasta here. Okay. Thanks. Everyone is Bernie. Well, that's not
[4048.50s -> 4070.26s]  true. That's not necessarily true. Oh, FPS gameplay. Every one of them is from Alabama.
[4070.26s -> 4075.34s]  That's not true. There was that one guy that was from every country on earth.
[4076.22s -> 4113.98s]  So, I mean, that's not true. Stream will be popping. This is the bird. It's Finley. Oh, hi.
[4114.78s -> 4135.40s]  Uh, who are you? Are you a ghost? What? I don't think so. Are you sure? Hmm. Yep. That's great.
[4138.44s -> 4155.98s]  You're not wrong. So, um, who are you? Finley. Who are you? The detective. Howdy. Wait a minute.
[4156.86s -> 4164.73s]  Finley. I know that name. I'm pretty well known around here. Around local dance circles.
[4165.45s -> 4171.29s]  Fuck. No, I can't. I can't do Irish. I can't. No, not Irish. Not Irish. Not Irish. Anybody.
[4171.29s -> 4176.57s]  Anything but Irish. Anything. You're Martin's friend. Ah, yeah. What are you? What are you
[4176.57s -> 4183.27s]  doing here? Oh, practicing for the dance competition. It's tomorrow. How long have you been down here?
[4184.15s -> 4190.10s]  Uh, geez. Like two weeks, I think. I didn't even realize.
[4193.05s -> 4202.52s]  Wait. Two weeks? Have you seen any ghosts around? Nah. Just me down here. Does Martin know you're
[4202.52s -> 4209.16s]  here? I don't think so. He never comes down here. Really? Why not? He thinks every dark
[4209.16s -> 4213.00s]  space is haunted. Oh, he reads all those ghost books and thinks there's a ghost in every
[4213.00s -> 4221.29s]  square. It's good for me, though. Perfect spot to try. You've been dancing for two weeks, right?
[4222.81s -> 4230.18s]  All right. Yeah. Aren't you tired? I mean, I
[4230.18s -> 4238.70s]  picked naps. These mushrooms are super nutritious. Gross. Mushrooms are disgusting.
[4238.70s -> 4247.77s]  That's your opinion, detective. No, it's a fact. Okay. Okay.
[4250.52s -> 4254.92s]  Anyway, Martin's been super spooked out because he's been hearing weird noise down
[4254.92s -> 4262.70s]  the island. Any idea what that is? I've been listening to my radio while dancing.
[4262.70s -> 4271.67s]  Let me tell you, it has been crazy. This cave has lots of holes in it. The sound from your radio
[4271.67s -> 4278.92s]  could easily travel up to the surface. I bet it's super warped, too. You know you've been trapped in
[4278.92s -> 4293.91s]  here, right? The cave's been blocked off by rocks. Really? Really? Really? Really? Okay, here we are.
[4293.91s -> 4300.23s]  No, yeah, right here. Right there. I think this is it right here. That's so funny. Yeah, you could
[4300.23s -> 4314.58s]  have died. Then I'd actually be a ghost. I didn't even think of that. Yeah. Anyway, let's go. Let's
[4314.58s -> 4347.16s]  leave. Oh, look at me. Finley. Hi, Martin. Hi. What are you doing here? I was in the cave.
[4349.61s -> 4362.66s]  What? How did you get in? It's been sealed up for weeks. Two weeks, to be exact. As it turns out,
[4362.66s -> 4368.79s]  there was never a ghost. It was Finley in the cave the whole time. She was so wrapped up in
[4368.79s -> 4374.50s]  practicing she didn't even notice the cave got caved in. The noises from her radio powered up to
[4374.50s -> 4385.13s]  her surface and sounds really scary. But my ghost books. I was so sure it was a ghost. No, just me.
[4385.13s -> 4390.92s]  Ghosts assure you you should never trust books. Don't ever read one. Always use the internet
[4390.92s -> 4405.69s]  instead. Yeah. Books are, without exception, actually inaccurate. Yep. Wait. Hold on. Hi,
[4406.09s -> 4410.15s]  apologies for the interruption. I hope you're enjoying the game. I won't keep you for long.
[4410.15s -> 4415.37s]  Well, I agree with the detective on most issues. There are contexts in which books can be very
[4415.37s -> 4419.88s]  useful and informative. It's important to check the validity of the author's sources
[4419.88s -> 4425.11s]  and to check the book is up to date. The internet can also be a useful place to find information,
[4425.11s -> 4429.83s]  but make sure you're getting your information from a trusted site. Thank you for your time.
[4429.83s -> 4439.56s]  Enjoy the rest of the game. So anyway, as I was saying, books have no place in society.
[4439.56s -> 4446.01s]  Sure thing. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for opening my eyes to the usefulness
[4446.01s -> 4461.66s]  of the internet and the uselessness of books. You're very welcome. The useless snake.
[4461.66s -> 4467.58s]  So just to be clear, you were practicing for the competition this whole time.
[4467.58s -> 4473.26s]  I'm in it to win it. I'm still not entirely sure what this dance competition involves.
[4473.26s -> 4481.34s]  Dance competition. Best dancer wins. Who else is competing? That's a good point.
[4482.62s -> 4493.64s]  Just us, I guess. Don't forget Moe the Mouse. Who? One of the ghost scientists. The what?
[4493.64s -> 4500.30s]  Don't worry about it. I think we need more entrance. I know a few hardworking friends
[4500.30s -> 4507.08s]  who could use a good boogie, but they won't be here tomorrow. Well, let's move the competition
[4507.08s -> 4521.80s]  to today. Before we dance, I just want to say thanks for solving the mystery, detective.
[4521.88s -> 4529.08s]  No problem at all. I had a lot of fun. Help. Larry figured out where the noises were coming from.
[4529.08s -> 4532.90s]  Larry? Is that the lobster? The one that talks over everybody?
[4532.90s -> 4540.95s]  Well, I give my thanks to Larry too. Shall we boogie?
[4540.95s -> 4562.25s]  Let's go. I beat the game. Holy shit. Frog Detective's fucking got some monster moves.
[4562.81s -> 4576.95s]  He needs some space. Hey, he's just flexing on everyone. Yeah, he really is. Like everyone's
[4576.95s -> 4595.69s]  going to get out of the way. Who has the best moves though? Let's see. What a mystery.
[4603.05s -> 4610.10s]  Tier list. Okay. I think we've practiced enough. Wait a minute. Who's judging? Wait,
[4610.10s -> 4617.98s]  this is the best part of the whole game. I'll do it. All right. We have to decide. Let's go.
[4620.92s -> 4637.24s]  All right. All right. Okay. All right. No, no, you can't pull out the robot. No.
[4637.32s -> 4651.46s]  And next. All right. I like it. All right. That's the best one so far. That's the single lady.
[4658.22s -> 4682.66s]  That's robot two. Nope. That's all right. That shit face. That shit face guy at wedding.
[4683.46s -> 4686.82s]  When the wedding circle forms and everyone starts dancing and they're like, you go in,
[4686.82s -> 4690.90s]  now you go in. And everyone's like clapping along and there's some really cool shit. And then
[4690.90s -> 4696.26s]  somebody just stumbles into the middle and they're fucked. And all they can do is just move their
[4696.26s -> 4700.10s]  arms around people like, yeah, awesome. But in your head, you're going, holy fuck man. Somebody
[4700.10s -> 4706.82s]  sit down. Somebody's got to sit that guy down and give him a water. It was Larry. It was Larry.
[4707.62s -> 4716.58s]  No, no, no. There's no poll. It was that like single ladies. Yeah. Yep. I didn't, I didn't
[4716.58s -> 4740.42s]  did no votes for that one. Sorry. This is the election. What was the plot of the game?
[4741.06s -> 4745.06s]  I don't know. I was concentrating on doing voices for 85% of it. I don't even know what we did.
[4746.34s -> 4750.18s]  We went to an island and we solved it. There was a cave that was noise was coming out of it.
[4750.74s -> 4767.05s]  I don't remember anything. Hopefully you guys can do new game plus pog. Oh, well, that's cool.
[4768.90s -> 4776.68s]  This is the last case that we saw. Okay. Cool. I wonder what happened there. All I know is that
[4777.64s -> 4783.51s]  on this picture, there's a giant enemy crap. No, fuck that. I'm not doing that one again.
[4784.15s -> 4795.11s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want to keep that. Okay. When we do the community content,
[4795.11s -> 4801.19s]  and I just know I'm continuing to perpetuate the meme of the giant enemy spider because there are
[4801.19s -> 4808.97s]  like 10 giant enemy spider remixes tonight. So I, all right, we're going to, there's a lot of remixes
[4809.69s -> 4810.25s]  already.
[4813.42s -> 4820.82s]  Frog detective, crime solving agency. Frog detective speaking. How can I help you? Detective
[4821.62s -> 4827.80s]  supervisor. Great work on the haunted island mystery. Thank you. I tried really hard.
[4828.92s -> 4834.18s]  I don't think even lobster cop could have solved that one. I think you're underestimating lobster
[4834.18s -> 4841.06s]  cop. You're probably right. Anyway, as I saw you busted a groove at the dance competition.
[4843.00s -> 4854.20s]  Yeah. Where'd you see that? It was on TV. Every channel, every channel in HD. Cool. I didn't even
[4854.20s -> 4861.08s]  see any cameras. Well, you certainly impressed the public. My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[4861.80s -> 4868.36s]  Mostly the calls are about your dancing, but I did get one call about a case. Have you heard of
[4868.36s -> 4877.43s]  warlock woods? I haven't. Well, there's some very strange going on things around there.
[4878.07s -> 4883.67s]  They need our best investigator on the job. Lobster cop was not available.
[4886.46s -> 4894.79s]  Can you handle another case detective? I can handle anything. The detective will return
[4896.33s -> 4904.15s]  in the fucking star wars episode two, the case of the invisible wizard. Oh no, that's the wrong
[4904.79s -> 4911.42s]  franchise. Captain America will return. Star Wars will return. Well, whoever wouldn't know
[4911.42s -> 4926.76s]  star wars will return. That was cute. It's already out. It's out now. Play it. Don't play it right
[4926.76s -> 4931.24s]  now. No, but no, no, no, no, no. We don't have time for that. We don't have time for that. How
[4931.24s -> 4947.27s]  long is it? Yes, we do. It's another hour. It's 30 minutes. All right. All right. Let's do another
[4947.27s -> 4950.71s]  one. Let's do let's do frog detective chapter two. Let's go. All right. Let's do it. Yeah. All
[4950.71s -> 4962.02s]  right. Let's do it. Guys, I already I think I already own it. Do I? Case of the invisible wizard.
[4963.40s -> 4970.60s]  Done. I already got it. It takes like an hour to be. All right. Then fucking whatever. Fine.
[4970.60s -> 4979.66s]  This is cute. We got time for community. This community content is not going to be as long as
[4979.66s -> 4985.77s]  the last one. It's like half as much stuff because it's like a part two and it's catching us up to
[4985.77s -> 4996.12s]  like last week. Oh, look at that. I do. I have it already. Yeah, don't worry. This one is what's
[4996.12s -> 5002.09s]  it called? You're going to hear a loud and I'm really sorry about that. It wasn't even that loud.
[5004.31s -> 5011.62s]  Dude, hyper hype in the chat, hype in the chat, hype train. What the fuck is going on?
[5011.62s -> 5018.26s]  Hype train started. I disabled hype trains. So don't even try. They physically are turned off
[5018.26s -> 5039.83s]  on this channel. Looking for a game to capture. Found one. Found one. Frog Detective 2. I got to
[5039.83s -> 5053.50s]  change the game, right? This is not accurate. We're in Frog Detective 2 now. The case of the
[5053.50s -> 5066.47s]  invisible wizard. This is cute. Isn't that cute? Speed run it. Can you? Can I speed run this? I
[5066.47s -> 5073.19s]  don't know. I don't want to speed run it. I want to take my time and have some fun. All right. Let's
[5073.19s -> 5079.35s]  keep going. Here we go. Frog Detective 2. New voices. It's a new game. There's going to be new
[5079.35s -> 5087.11s]  voices. And unfortunately the voice actor from Frog Detective 1 did not move on to Frog Detective 2.
[5087.11s -> 5092.01s]  He was in the middle of other projects. So that's the biggest gripe that I think a lot of people
[5092.01s -> 5100.95s]  have with this one. I've heard. So hopefully that it's still, you know, hopefully people still think
[5100.95s -> 5106.62s]  it's any good. I don't know. Let's find out. Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency. Frog Detective
[5106.62s -> 5117.93s]  speaking. Hey detective. Hi supervisor. Why did you hang up on me? Huh? We were talking just a
[5117.93s -> 5126.98s]  moment ago about a new case. The one at Warlock Woods, right? Yeah. I hung up because I got too
[5126.98s -> 5138.90s]  excited about solving another mystery. That's understandable. What can I, what can you tell me
[5138.90s -> 5147.10s]  about this new case? It's a doozy detective. Hold on to your hat. Supervisor, you know I can't wear
[5147.10s -> 5155.56s]  hats. Sorry. Anyway, what, what, what, what, what the fuck do you want me to do about this?
[5156.49s -> 5165.00s]  All right. I told you what happened. All right. You want, you want me to mute his sections and I,
[5165.00s -> 5169.72s]  hold on. I know that voice actor. You want me to call him and see if he'll like, he'll come
[5169.72s -> 5177.03s]  into like a discord call and like read it. Well, it costs a lot of money. I know that actor. Okay.
[5177.03s -> 5184.07s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Let me, let me see if they're on discord. They are.
[5184.07s -> 5190.09s]  They're online. Well, you just, just hold on. Wait until I get them in a call. A couple of days ago,
[5190.09s -> 5195.24s]  a new resident moved in. A shy kind of gal. Doesn't like to be the center of attention.
[5195.24s -> 5200.50s]  Anyway, she settles into the new house and doesn't go outside to greet anyone.
[5200.50s -> 5205.46s]  The residents of the town feel like they need to welcome her properly. So they organize a welcoming
[5205.46s -> 5213.70s]  parade. Great idea. Absolutely. But someone in the town seemed to think otherwise. Last night,
[5213.70s -> 5221.86s]  the parade decorations were destroyed. What? I know, right? So rude. Nobody has any leads on
[5221.86s -> 5227.62s]  the case. They don't. I'm waiting for them to fucking reply to me. Jesus guys. I can't just
[5227.62s -> 5239.58s]  turn it off. I'm waiting for a reply on discord. Everybody needs to relax. Holy shit. That's where
[5239.58s -> 5250.97s]  you. All right. Hold on. Are you fucking around now? Jesus fucking Christ. Hold on.
[5255.05s -> 5268.18s]  Hello? Hey, what's up? It's me. Oh, hey, what's going on? How are you doing? I'm doing good. Did
[5268.18s -> 5273.62s]  you get my messages that I sent you? Yes, I did. All right. Do you, are you cool with doing this?
[5274.18s -> 5279.88s]  Yeah, it's okay. All right. So I'm going to mute the frog sections and then you can come in.
[5280.70s -> 5285.02s]  And I mean, it might be delayed a little bit. It's okay. No, that's fine with me. I'll do that.
[5285.02s -> 5294.14s]  That's fine. Cool. Real voice, by the way. Real voice, by the way. Are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready.
[5295.74s -> 5314.71s]  Okay. Oh, oh, sorry. That's me. I'm the detective. I'm aware. Warlock Woods is a magic town. So it's
[5314.71s -> 5320.79s]  not the easiest place to get to. You'll need to take an enchanted cart to the end of the line,
[5320.79s -> 5327.78s]  then travel the rest of the way on foot. Too easy. You'll need to question everybody to get to the
[5327.78s -> 5343.62s]  bottom of things. Do you think you can solve the mystery? Great. Hop to it. Oh, I forgot to mention
[5343.62s -> 5356.92s]  the new resident of the woods is special. She's invisible. Oh, that was loud. Hey, can you,
[5356.92s -> 5366.15s]  are you eating something? Yeah. Can you put, can you put just, I've got a little lot of people
[5366.15s -> 5386.15s]  here watching. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Oh, that was loud. And a wizard, an invisible wizard. Cool. Um,
[5386.15s -> 5391.03s]  what's the relevance of her being invisible? Nobody knows what she looks like. So they're
[5391.03s -> 5396.58s]  really excited to find out. That's the parade and the decorations and the celebrations.
[5396.58s -> 5410.12s]  They want her to be un-visible? De-invisibled? Uh, uh, visible. Exactly. Anyway, how do you
[5410.12s -> 5416.34s]  have everything you need? Um, I have my shoes, my jumper, my pants. I think I'm missing something.
[5416.98s -> 5423.85s]  Your magnifying glass? Of course. It's on the table next to the die. Why did I say diaper?
[5423.85s -> 5430.31s]  I was gonna say diaper. Yeah, you're not very good at reading. What the fuck am I,
[5430.31s -> 5439.74s]  how was that, why was I going to say diaper? Unprofessional. Shut the fuck up,
[5439.82s -> 5462.97s]  dickhead. That's very rude to say. Am I getting paid for this by the way? Thanks supervisor.
[5464.17s -> 5482.30s]  Good luck detective. Ah, my trusty magnifying glass. I can't solve mysteries without it.
[5482.30s -> 5501.16s]  What, he's calling me now? He's calling me, you're calling me now? Should I answer it? Hello? I'm
[5501.16s -> 5506.60s]  sorry. Okay. It's all right. Yes, I'll, I'll pay you by the way. I didn't mean to fly off the handle
[5506.60s -> 5517.30s]  like that. I'll turn it back down. Same thing, same deal. Okay. Let's go. Ah, my trustworthy
[5517.30s -> 5522.74s]  magnifying glass. I can't solve mysteries without it. Well, maybe I could, but I wouldn't want to.
[5525.85s -> 5536.04s]  It's missing background white noise from his mic. No, no, don't give me that idea. Please.
[5538.06s -> 5545.22s]  Fuck. God damn it. Hold on. That's fucking stupid enough for me to think it's funny. Just wait.
[5545.22s -> 5565.85s]  He has push to talk on. Yeah, but hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me one second. This
[5565.85s -> 5640.07s]  is worth, this is worth it to me. Bear it back. Okay. I just had to, uh, need to just fix his mic.
[5640.07s -> 5651.43s]  Something's wrong with his mic. Sorry. There we go. Look through your magnifier with right click.
[5651.99s -> 5676.26s]  Yes, yes, yes. We know how to do this. Let's go. Are you ready? Lobster cop. Uh oh.
[5679.46s -> 5698.89s]  It was a wink. Is it Larry? No, it's not Larry. Ah, it's the famous frog detective.
[5706.49s -> 5714.50s]  Perhaps not, but I'm sure you will be soon. I hope so. What brings you to my office detective?
[5714.50s -> 5726.81s]  It's actually next door, right here. Oh, I thought that was a cupboard. Oh, that's my office.
[5728.12s -> 5735.50s]  I've been putting all my cleaning supplies in there. Yes, I'm looking every time you do it.
[5735.50s -> 5742.76s]  They even say, this is my office. And then you say, sure, this is your cleaning frog.
[5743.72s -> 5746.89s]  And then I say, I'm a crime-solving frog, not a cleaning frog.
[5757.05s -> 5760.25s]  Excuse my ignorance detective. I wasn't trying to offend.
[5762.01s -> 5766.25s]  Make him louder. Turn him up. It's, can you talk for me for a second?
[5769.82s -> 5778.06s]  That's not, it needs to be a little louder. You're too quiet. Let me turn you up a little.
[5781.05s -> 5787.67s]  Say something. Is that better? A little bit, say it again. How's that? Is that sound better?
[5788.97s -> 5794.17s]  No, it turns, your mic is fucked up. You don't have any, hold on, wait, wait, wait,
[5794.17s -> 5799.37s]  check to see what mic you have plugged in. I think I have this one plugged. I think I'm on,
[5799.37s -> 5807.21s]  it says, larger tech webcam microphone 920. No, no, no, no, no, wrong mic. You have a better mic,
[5807.21s -> 5814.01s]  don't you? No, I don't. You don't have a better mic. Aren't you a voice actor?
[5819.37s -> 5823.45s]  You don't have, you don't have a single. Let me try plugging this one in. Do you think this one's
[5823.45s -> 5836.90s]  better? Hello? Is that better? Does that sound better on this one? Or should you go back to the
[5836.90s -> 5844.15s]  other one? No, go back to the other one. The other one, other one, other one. That's a little better.
[5849.37s -> 5859.10s]  Why do you sound so different on this one? You're on, you're on Skype on the phone.
[5859.74s -> 5865.98s]  All right, fuck it, whatever. We gotta, we, I mean, we can't just do this all day.
[5866.86s -> 5870.94s]  This is, that's fine. So I'm going to put you, I'll just put you, I'll pump the phone through.
[5870.94s -> 5882.71s]  That's fine. You know, you want to just come over? Just come over, just come over. Like I'll do my
[5882.71s -> 5890.50s]  best impression of you as best as I fucking can. Two hours? Two, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now,
[5890.50s -> 5899.77s]  like right now. Get here now. I don't have a car. Just drive here now. I'll do my best. Okay.
[5901.51s -> 5907.18s]  I'll be here in two hours. Be here in fucking 10 minutes. I'm getting another phone call.
[5907.18s -> 5924.26s]  What the fuck is calling me now? What? Stop, hold on. Stop, stop. Hello? Oh, Jeremy. I'm so glad I
[5924.26s -> 5929.62s]  got to get a hold of you. It's me, Bill Blueberry. I heard you were looking for some voice work.
[5929.62s -> 5940.60s]  You're looking for some voice actors. I can do voice work. Okay. You'll be here. I gotta hold
[5940.60s -> 5944.28s]  the phone with my mouth. Are you, are you going to, how, when, when do you think you'll be here?
[5944.84s -> 5950.46s]  Is he gone? All right, he's gone. Fucking Blueberry calling me. Doesn't he? I hate this shit.
[5950.46s -> 5956.12s]  People know I'm fucking streaming. So aggravating. Like why would you call me during the middle of
[5956.12s -> 5963.88s]  the stream to like try to get on the stream? Like get the fuck out of here, dude. Anyways,
[5963.88s -> 5973.46s]  I'll do my best. Excuse my ignorance, detective. I wasn't trying to offend. I'm a very busy boy,
[5973.46s -> 5978.50s]  a head full of mysteries. Sometimes I forget to be polite. If I was polite all the time,
[5978.50s -> 5982.66s]  I would never have time to soften it. Hold on. I can do better than that. That's a better,
[5982.66s -> 5987.62s]  better voice, right? I got a better voice than that, don't I? He's just like, oh, look at me.
[5989.34s -> 5993.98s]  I understand. Maybe that's why I'm not as talented as you, lobster cop.
[5995.34s -> 6001.42s]  Perhaps, but detective, you must keep trying. Never give up. I can give you some tips if you'd
[6001.42s -> 6011.16s]  like. Wow. Yes, please. Tip number one. Pay attention. You should make sure you are looking
[6011.16s -> 6021.13s]  at things and paying attention to words. Yes, quite right. Tip number two. Everyone is a suspect.
[6022.92s -> 6032.15s]  Even you. I will suspect myself much more from now on. Good call. Good call. Tip number three.
[6032.15s -> 6039.62s]  Carry a notebook. Oh, I'm not really big on books. They are without exception factually inaccurate.
[6041.50s -> 6046.06s]  Detective, don't be foolish. A book you write yourself cannot be factually inaccurate if you
[6046.06s -> 6056.38s]  are writing facts. I suppose you're right. I don't have a notebook though. Well, it's your
[6056.38s -> 6061.66s]  lucky day. I have a spare notebook on my desk. You can decorate it and use it all you like.
[6063.10s -> 6069.34s]  Wow, really? Yep. There are stickers you can use too. I bought them all with my crime solving money.
[6070.52s -> 6076.82s]  Cool. I'll let you get to it, detective. Head into my office when you're ready to decorate.
[6076.82s -> 6082.74s]  Okay. Thanks, lobster cop. Thanks. Thanks, lobster cop. It's fucking hard to do.
[6083.30s -> 6097.34s]  I hope he gets here soon. We can decorate the office? Oh, stickers. Which stickers should I
[6097.34s -> 6195.21s]  pick? And where should they go? Oh, this is tough. This is tough. Oh, schmock. That's good.
[6201.08s -> 6215.37s]  No. Wait, this is kind of off. Worm dick. All right. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
[6216.63s -> 6228.79s]  Sorry. Sorry for the worm dick. Done. Done. Clap for me. Clap for me. Clap for me. I fucking
[6228.79s -> 6236.55s]  demand it. Clap for me. I fucking demand it. Clap for me. I fucking demand it. I got a notebook.
[6236.55s -> 6253.45s]  Open it. Oh, there's a new mechanic. Notebook. Magnifier. Invisible wizard. That's a lot of pages.
[6255.50s -> 6259.90s]  Notes. Number one best detective has lots of fans. It's super cool. So many trophies. I hope I get
[6259.90s -> 6287.61s]  a trophy one day. You don't have any trophies. Liar. There's no chairs in here. It's okay.
[6290.49s -> 6295.67s]  You can stand right there. Right in front of the mic. Right here? That's a little too close. Hold
[6295.67s -> 6301.10s]  back. Okay. Is this ready? Good. All right. I'll get you some. You can sit down right there. That's
[6301.10s -> 6310.41s]  fine. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. Sick. You know what to do. You know what to do, man of the hour.
[6311.48s -> 6321.24s]  Say it. Say the line. You came just in time. It's time to solve it. Oh. Are you all right?
[6321.24s -> 6329.58s]  Are you okay? My leg. That was my leg. I know. You all right? No, you're fine. You're fine. You
[6329.58s -> 6336.82s]  okay? Yeah, I'm okay. This was slippery. Why is it so wet? Because I sweat a lot.
[6339.35s -> 6350.42s]  Okay. It's time to solve another mystery. Did it. Does this look swollen? Yeah.
[6351.62s -> 6381.56s]  Really swollen. Oh, shit. Super hot. What? Are you good? I am 100% fine. Nobody worried about me.
[6382.28s -> 6389.40s]  It's not swollen. I just had a full job of peanut butter in my pocket and it slid down to the bottom
[6389.40s -> 6400.44s]  of my pants because I have a hole in my pants. Oh, okay. You're good. Snacking on the go.
[6407.64s -> 6415.67s]  You're making it worse. New characters. Hold on. We got new characters. He didn't shit his pants.
[6416.87s -> 6446.78s]  Does Jerma Wink even work? What the fuck? It didn't go through? What a scam. Warlock Woods.
[6457.56s -> 6469.53s]  Oh, my stars. It's you. It's me. The famous lobster cop. I really thought you'd be a lobster.
[6470.60s -> 6479.18s]  I know I'm frog. Yeah. Why is your name lobster cop? I have to tell you something.
[6480.38s -> 6491.35s]  I'm not lobster cop. Why not? I don't know how to answer that. Who are you? I'm the detective.
[6492.65s -> 6503.30s]  Frog detective. I see. Is lobster cop not available? Unfortunately, not. Well, I think you'll do just
[6503.30s -> 6513.58s]  fine. Thanks. I'm Susan. Hi, Susan. I'm the one that contacted the agency,
[6514.38s -> 6520.38s]  which I think you'll find excludes me from being a suspect. Oh, I didn't know that would work.
[6521.40s -> 6530.15s]  You should know these things, detective. I'm sorry. It's okay. I think you should still question me,
[6530.15s -> 6540.70s]  though. Getting into Eeyore territory, but remove all doubt. Okay. Question me all you like.
[6541.50s -> 6548.82s]  Oh, the wizard. You got a balloon here. Do you know the wizard? I'm sorry. I spoke up before you
[6548.82s -> 6555.93s]  did. Do you know the wizard personally? Nobody knows her personally. Well, not here at least.
[6557.82s -> 6564.41s]  Not me. Right. But I had a lot to do with the organization of the parade.
[6565.37s -> 6572.01s]  And I was the one to start the investigation. You mentioned that. Worth bringing up again.
[6572.97s -> 6581.99s]  So you were fine with her moving to town? Absolutely. That old house has been empty
[6581.99s -> 6587.98s]  for years and it's really nice. Someone wants to live there. He's a lot of fixing up, but I'll
[6587.98s -> 6598.52s]  look nice soon. I think plus it's always exciting to have a new neighbor. Sure is. I put up a sign
[6598.52s -> 6604.76s]  I made for the wizard, but it got knocked down last night. Feeling pretty sad about it. If I'm
[6604.76s -> 6611.74s]  honest, I know you're here to solve the mystery, but I just need to tell someone how I feel.
[6613.02s -> 6619.35s]  You can talk to me about it. Thanks. I'm not a professional sign maker, but I worked really hard
[6619.35s -> 6626.02s]  on that sign. Really. I struggled to understand why someone would knock it down. It feels so
[6626.02s -> 6631.78s]  heartless. And now I'm not sure who to trust. I thought everyone here would be thrilled to have
[6631.78s -> 6638.06s]  a new neighbor. It's a tricky situation for sure. Some people are protective of their communities
[6638.06s -> 6643.72s]  and think new people are going to change things for the worse, but that's almost never the case.
[6643.72s -> 6648.97s]  New people make places better because they bring new perspectives, especially in small communities.
[6648.97s -> 6653.94s]  Hopefully it's just misunderstanding or a mistake. I'd like to believe people are good.
[6653.94s -> 6663.62s]  That being said, I'm treating everyone as a suspect. Not me, right? Even you, especially you.
[6663.62s -> 6672.10s]  Especially me? Oh, I know. Sorry. Not sure why I said that, but you're not off the hook just yet.
[6672.74s -> 6679.61s]  That's it. Detective, could you please find me a hook? I could hang the sign back up with it.
[6679.61s -> 6688.34s]  Oh, okay. I'll do my best. Question me all you like. Okay, I need a hook. Small,
[6688.34s -> 6696.74s]  fucking enemy. It's wider. Square. All right, Susan. Motive. Maybe she didn't like her sign
[6696.74s -> 6703.35s]  destroyed at the parade out of embarrassment. Something to fix the sign. It says she's not as
[6703.35s -> 6708.14s]  suspicious. This makes her much more suspicious. Upset about the parade being destroyed. Worked
[6708.14s -> 6727.10s]  really hard on her sign. What do you sound like? What do you sound like? What do you sound like?
[6727.10s -> 6738.55s]  What do you sound like? What do you sound like? Hello, little frog. I'm Ralph. Why are you yelling?
[6739.69s -> 6747.10s]  I'm just making sure you can hear me. I can hear you. You don't have to yell. You're very
[6747.10s -> 6755.14s]  small. Might be difficult for you to hear. I'm small, but I'm also very close to you. Being
[6755.14s -> 6763.74s]  small isn't the same as being far away. Are you sure? You can hear me at this volume? Yes.
[6764.81s -> 6776.18s]  Weird. I'm the detective. I'm here to solve mystery. Really? Yes. But you're so small.
[6777.82s -> 6788.84s]  I'm of average frog height. Can I ask you some questions about case? Questioning me, huh? What
[6788.84s -> 6799.30s]  happened to your eye? May I ask why you have an eye patch on? That's Ralph's business. Oh, it'd be
[6799.30s -> 6804.15s]  really good for me to know why you have an eye patch. Sometimes a boy just wants to wear an eye
[6804.15s -> 6815.94s]  patch. That shouldn't make me a suspicious. You put it on for fashion. Kind of. Detective,
[6815.94s -> 6822.65s]  I don't want to get into this too much, but I watched a movie last night about pirates,
[6822.65s -> 6831.64s]  and I loved it. And there's another three left. Three whole movies. Can you believe it?
[6831.64s -> 6838.33s]  Sequels? I've never heard of a movie having a sequel before. A giant enemy. I know, right?
[6838.33s -> 6845.77s]  Usually sequels are reserved for video games. Yes, it's extremely normal to have a video game
[6845.77s -> 6852.92s]  sequel. Especially for games with large audiences like the Toad Investigation Series. Yeah. Anyway,
[6852.92s -> 6857.21s]  I was watching a pirate movie last night. That's where I was. And for that reason,
[6857.21s -> 6865.18s]  I have decided to wear an eye patch. Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks. Questioning me,
[6865.18s -> 6873.77s]  what about the wizard? I can't wait till there's a wizard so I can do a fucking wizard voice.
[6873.77s -> 6878.79s]  You know how that is every time. How do you feel about the wizard moving in?
[6878.79s -> 6888.12s]  It's nothing against the wizard, but I've been living away. I've been living with my friend
[6888.12s -> 6898.90s]  Carlos for a while now, and our space is big. I would really like my own home. I'd been eyeing
[6898.90s -> 6906.89s]  off that old house for ages, but maybe I'd move in one day. But the wizard, not there first.
[6906.89s -> 6914.57s]  I see. It's my fault, I guess. I shouldn't hold it against the wizard. Hmm. This house is twice
[6914.57s -> 6920.71s]  as big as all the other houses. Maybe you could renovate it and turn it into two houses. You could
[6920.71s -> 6927.70s]  split it down the middle, or have one house upstairs and one house downstairs, like an apartment.
[6927.70s -> 6934.07s]  That's a pretty cool idea. I like Carlos and everything, but I'm a private boy.
[6934.07s -> 6938.63s]  I understand. I don't have any renovation supplies, though.
[6938.63s -> 6944.90s]  I'll see if I can track some down for you. Thanks for your help, detective.
[6944.90s -> 6955.00s]  Maybe if I do a good job, I'll get my own building, sure. I'm excited to see it.
[6955.00s -> 6965.42s]  Dude, three houses. Two houses stacked on top of three houses? A motive in true pirate fashion
[6965.42s -> 6972.98s]  wanted to cause a ruckus, needs building supplies, loves pirates, eye patches cosmetic only,
[6972.98s -> 6977.30s]  a private boy, wants to renovate, thinks I am too small. I am not.
[6977.30s -> 6985.37s]  Why don't you get it out of your system now while you have a minute. Nice.
[6995.99s -> 7013.21s]  Hmm. What? Huh? Who are you? The detective. Oh, I thought Lobster Cop was coming.
[7013.21s -> 7024.95s]  Huh? What? Did you say something about Lobster Cop? No. But I heard- Can this frog read my mind?
[7024.95s -> 7036.79s]  Why are you speaking like that? Like what? Like this? Whoa! Is that what telepathy is?
[7036.79s -> 7042.84s]  Can you hear this frog? You're saying everything out loud.
[7042.84s -> 7048.81s]  Wow, this frog has a temper. Anyway, who are you?
[7048.81s -> 7053.59s]  I'm Noddy. Okay.
[7053.59s -> 7062.84s]  I'm the mayor of Warlock Woods. Okay. Did you ask me to come?
[7062.84s -> 7069.42s]  No. I would have asked for Lobster Cop instead. I really need to emphasize I can hear you.
[7069.42s -> 7075.59s]  Stop listening to me. Okay. Can I ask you some questions about taste?
[7075.59s -> 7082.63s]  I guess so. Tell me what you want to know. How do I change your voice to something that's
[7082.63s -> 7089.27s]  not as awful? Well, okay. I'll take that as a- I'll take that criticism.
[7089.27s -> 7095.46s]  Can you tell me about last night? Nothing.
[7095.46s -> 7099.48s]  Oh. But I can tell you about the wizard.
[7099.48s -> 7102.71s]  I know basically everything there is to know about her.
[7102.71s -> 7108.18s]  That's great. First of all, she's a wizard.
[7108.18s -> 7113.80s]  Uh-huh. And she- get this. She's invisible.
[7113.80s -> 7124.47s]  Great. And she just moved in. And now we're going- and- and she's a wizard.
[7124.47s -> 7128.87s]  We're gonna take the wizard and we're gonna- they're taking over all of our- all of-
[7128.87s -> 7133.50s]  they're 1% wizards. Fucking back to Bernie.
[7133.50s -> 7141.43s]  I think you mentioned that. No, I don't think I did.
[7141.43s -> 7147.30s]  He only has one voice. It's- it's just different spectrums of Bernie.
[7147.30s -> 7149.94s]  It's like this. It's like this. It's like this. It's like this.
[7149.94s -> 7154.58s]  This is like this. It's like this. Everybody has to sound like Bernie Sanders.
[7154.58s -> 7158.66s]  All of us. Doesn't matter what we do. Doesn't matter how close we can be to each other.
[7158.66s -> 7167.86s]  We're always gonna be Bernie. Right, okay. Sorry.
[7167.86s -> 7172.34s]  It's fine. Anyway, tell me what you want to know.
[7173.66s -> 7178.62s]  That's a real voice. That's real. That's two hours straight of doing this.
[7178.62s -> 7183.93s]  That's- that was what that was. About the wizard.
[7183.93s -> 7190.25s]  How do you feel about the wizard coming to live here?
[7190.97s -> 7196.89s]  Oh, heck, how do I answer this? Well, I'm happy she's here,
[7196.89s -> 7202.01s]  but that house has been empty for ages. And I don't- didn't know she was coming,
[7202.01s -> 7205.77s]  all right? Nobody told me, you see. Not Bernie.
[7205.77s -> 7209.93s]  Look, I- oh my god, it's not Bernie. Do I- okay, do I sound like Bernie right now?
[7209.93s -> 7212.78s]  Do I sound like Bernie right now? I want to tell you something about-
[7212.78s -> 7216.47s]  I want to talk about this. Do I sound like Bernie Sanders?
[7216.47s -> 7220.89s]  No, I don't. My- my regular speaking voice has nothing to do with it.
[7220.89s -> 7230.63s]  When I talk normally, I go from sentence to sentence and everything is perfectly normal,
[7230.63s -> 7236.07s]  as you understand, as you hear now. I have absolutely nothing in common
[7236.07s -> 7240.74s]  with the way that he talks or the way that he enunciates words, okay?
[7240.74s -> 7246.34s]  God damn it. I think so.
[7246.34s -> 7250.02s]  She kind of came- wrong. He's doing it on purpose.
[7251.78s -> 7259.05s]  She kind of came at me at a weird time of night, and I- well, I thought that she was a ghost.
[7259.05s -> 7266.68s]  Oh, yeah, it was a bit messy. Oh, I tried to vacuum her up.
[7266.68s -> 7273.38s]  Hmm, with a vacuum. I put it on the highest setting.
[7273.46s -> 7278.10s]  Just really went to town with the vacuum. I think I really freaked her out,
[7278.10s -> 7284.55s]  and now she won't come out of the house. Um, please don't put me in jail.
[7284.55s -> 7286.63s]  You're not going to jail. Jail isn't real.
[7291.03s -> 7294.70s]  But you prob- you should probably apologize.
[7294.70s -> 7298.70s]  Okay, sorry, detective. I mean to the wizard.
[7298.70s -> 7303.42s]  Right, yeah. That's why I was helping with the parade, to apologize.
[7303.42s -> 7308.63s]  But she hasn't been out of the house. Also, the parade is ruined.
[7308.63s -> 7311.85s]  I see. This makes me sound really bad.
[7311.85s -> 7314.38s]  I swear I wanted the parade to be lovely.
[7314.38s -> 7317.58s]  As the mayor of the town, I booked a live band to play a song.
[7317.58s -> 7320.73s]  But as you can see, the stage is gross and ruined now.
[7320.73s -> 7323.93s]  The band is on their way, and I have no time to fix it.
[7323.93s -> 7327.29s]  They're a very famous band. I want to be as professional as possible.
[7327.29s -> 7339.35s]  Offer the voice actor a beer. You want a beer?
[7339.35s -> 7342.44s]  No. I- I offered him a beer.
[7342.44s -> 7349.88s]  What the fuck are you- Well, if only I had a rug or something to use, I could cover up the mess.
[7349.88s -> 7353.42s]  But the town is in disarray. I don't have time to track one down.
[7353.42s -> 7357.35s]  Oh, no. Thank you for your concern.
[7357.35s -> 7360.30s]  If you happen to find anything that would work, please let me know.
[7360.30s -> 7362.92s]  Will do. Do you have any more questions?
[7362.92s -> 7369.64s]  Hmm. Now, we need a rug. We need a rug. We need to fix the sign.
[7369.64s -> 7376.81s]  We need building supplies. He's not a drunk like some people.
[7376.81s -> 7379.24s]  But is that- is that- is that a shot at me?
[7382.25s -> 7388.30s]  What are you talking about? I haven't had- I haven't had a drink of alcohol in, like, two weeks.
[7388.30s -> 7393.94s]  What are you talking about? I drink alcohol, like, once every two months.
[7394.94s -> 7397.93s]  Maybe. He's sloshed.
[7398.65s -> 7399.93s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7399.93s -> 7411.02s]  Hey. Hey. Hey. Okay.
[7411.02s -> 7417.18s]  Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
[7417.18s -> 7418.54s]  Hi. Hi.
[7421.77s -> 7427.64s]  A customer.
[7427.64s -> 7431.74s]  Welcome to the Carlos All Things You Can Need shop.
[7431.74s -> 7433.51s]  Are you Carlos?
[7433.51s -> 7436.39s]  Yes. Just like the name of the shop. That's me.
[7438.14s -> 7443.40s]  How cool is that? The shop has my name on it.
[7443.40s -> 7446.97s]  So cool. My company also has my name on it.
[7446.97s -> 7449.38s]  What's your company called?
[7449.38s -> 7453.11s]  Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.
[7453.11s -> 7455.86s]  What's your name? Crime?
[7455.86s -> 7460.09s]  Oh, no. I'm the Frog Detective.
[7460.09s -> 7462.89s]  That's not really a name, though. More of a title.
[7462.89s -> 7466.15s]  Oh, I suppose you're right.
[7466.15s -> 7468.47s]  My shop actually has my name in it.
[7468.47s -> 7472.31s]  Cool. I'm jealous.
[7472.31s -> 7479.03s]  Thanks. Here in Warlock Woods, we are all our own biggest fans.
[7479.03s -> 7484.44s]  Being conceded is a societal construct. We have rejected it.
[7484.44s -> 7491.10s]  Hence why my shop is so popular. I sell portraits, among other things.
[7491.10s -> 7493.00s]  Wow. That's great.
[7493.00s -> 7498.62s]  My office neighbor, Lobster Cop, has a picture of himself right above his desk.
[7498.62s -> 7505.80s]  You know Lobster Cop? Holy heck. I've been a fan forever.
[7505.80s -> 7511.02s]  You know, he solved the mystery of the Haunted Island recently.
[7511.02s -> 7517.18s]  I don't think so. It was actually me that did that. That was me.
[7517.18s -> 7522.54s]  Wait, really? It was all over TV. The dance competition had a lobster in it.
[7522.54s -> 7525.35s]  Oh, you must be thinking of Larry.
[7525.35s -> 7531.51s]  You mean Small Larry? No, this was a regular-sized lobster.
[7531.51s -> 7535.56s]  Uh, no. Larry's regular-sized lobster.
[7536.71s -> 7538.31s]  About the Larry I know.
[7538.31s -> 7542.68s]  Oh, well. Agree to disagree.
[7542.68s -> 7545.16s]  I really did solve that mystery. It was me, detective.
[7547.19s -> 7550.01s]  That's really cool.
[7550.01s -> 7551.54s]  Thanks.
[7551.54s -> 7556.33s]  So you're like the second best detective, I suppose?
[7556.33s -> 7561.50s]  Yeah. Did somebody just put a germ of Pluto with a bloody nose?
[7561.50s -> 7564.31s]  Oh, no, no. What?
[7564.31s -> 7566.81s]  Yeah. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
[7566.81s -> 7568.90s]  Okay. What would you like to know?
[7568.90s -> 7571.74s]  Fucking Bernie. What do you need?
[7574.30s -> 7578.02s]  All right, it's over. I gotta stop the read now, normally.
[7578.02s -> 7579.30s]  You can go home now.
[7579.38s -> 7580.02s]  Are you sure?
[7580.02s -> 7581.38s]  Yeah. Get out of here. Get out of here,
[7581.38s -> 7586.63s]  because I can't pretend to be three, five, eight people anymore.
[7586.63s -> 7587.51s]  I'm staying.
[7587.51s -> 7590.02s]  Okay, you can stay.
[7590.02s -> 7591.30s]  Just here in my shop.
[7591.30s -> 7593.56s]  What about when you're closed up?
[7593.56s -> 7598.95s]  My shop doesn't close. My shop doesn't close.
[7598.95s -> 7604.22s]  It's 24 hours. What time do you close?
[7604.22s -> 7605.90s]  Oh, fucking, I'm doing it again.
[7605.90s -> 7611.02s]  What if somebody's a portrait of themselves at 4 a.m.?
[7611.02s -> 7612.46s]  You're open all the time?
[7612.46s -> 7618.54s]  Of course. I sleep and eat and look after myself.
[7618.54s -> 7623.70s]  My customers simply wake me if they need to buy something.
[7623.70s -> 7625.11s]  Where do you sleep?
[7625.11s -> 7628.42s]  I sleep standing up. Here's the training.
[7628.42s -> 7632.31s]  I'm the most committed shopkeeper at all of Warlock Woods.
[7632.31s -> 7634.79s]  Also, the only shopkeeper at all of Warlock Woods.
[7636.34s -> 7638.10s]  I'm the only one, Froggy.
[7638.10s -> 7639.69s]  Do you ever take breaks?
[7640.82s -> 7642.90s]  Sometimes, but I really like it here in my shop.
[7642.90s -> 7645.18s]  It's where I feel most at home.
[7645.18s -> 7649.40s]  The extreme shopkeeper lifestyle isn't for everyone,
[7649.40s -> 7652.12s]  but I take so much joy from my work.
[7652.12s -> 7655.58s]  Me too. Although, I must request that you look after yourself
[7655.58s -> 7658.78s]  and close the shop if you need a break.
[7658.78s -> 7661.10s]  Okay, I promise.
[7661.10s -> 7664.17s]  Anyway, did you say anything last night?
[7664.17s -> 7670.89s]  Nothing particularly interesting. Why?
[7671.21s -> 7671.77s]  She cried.
[7678.15s -> 7681.74s]  I think I need to question you a bit more.
[7681.74s -> 7683.78s]  Go for it.
[7683.78s -> 7685.46s]  What would you like to know?
[7685.46s -> 7687.30s]  Why do they always pause and go like, huh?
[7687.30s -> 7688.10s]  What do you want, huh?
[7688.66s -> 7689.78s]  Hi? Hey?
[7689.78s -> 7698.60s]  Frog voice actor.
[7698.60s -> 7700.36s]  Is he okay? Are you okay?
[7705.74s -> 7709.51s]  He swallowed an almond. He's all right.
[7709.51s -> 7715.64s]  What do you know about the new wizard that just moved in?
[7717.85s -> 7718.49s]  Who?
[7718.49s -> 7722.31s]  The invisible wizard that moved in literally next door.
[7722.31s -> 7725.54s]  Wait, really? Somebody moved in?
[7725.54s -> 7726.02s]  Yeah.
[7726.10s -> 7728.68s]  That place has been empty for ages.
[7728.68s -> 7730.58s]  I got to say hi.
[7730.58s -> 7733.50s]  Oh, the parade was meant to be for saying hi.
[7733.50s -> 7735.32s]  Get him some water.
[7735.32s -> 7740.94s]  He needs a parade? Parade?
[7740.94s -> 7743.80s]  The parade that everyone has been prepping for.
[7743.80s -> 7746.12s]  Oh, he's been working so hard. He needs a water.
[7746.12s -> 7751.70s]  He's been working so hard. He needs a water, doesn't he?
[7751.70s -> 7755.93s]  Get this guy a water.
[7755.93s -> 7759.75s]  Do you want a water or do you want a beer?
[7759.75s -> 7762.12s]  I want a beer.
[7762.12s -> 7763.24s]  God. Beer.
[7763.24s -> 7769.24s]  Oh, how nice. Can't wait.
[7769.24s -> 7772.22s]  It was destroyed last night.
[7772.22s -> 7772.86s]  What?
[7772.86s -> 7776.97s]  This conversation is a roller coaster of information.
[7776.97s -> 7779.98s]  I have literally no idea what's happening.
[7779.98s -> 7781.50s]  You weren't involved in the decoration.
[7784.62s -> 7786.62s]  You okay? You gonna be all right?
[7786.62s -> 7788.73s]  Yes, I'm fine.
[7788.73s -> 7791.99s]  You weren't involved in the decoration at all?
[7791.99s -> 7796.78s]  Nope. Should I offer to help now?
[7796.78s -> 7801.24s]  Wait, who is he? He needs a break.
[7811.11s -> 7813.75s]  He's like, what did you do before you came over here?
[7813.75s -> 7815.99s]  What did you eat? Like, you ate a bunch of shellfish?
[7816.63s -> 7818.94s]  Are you like allergic to something?
[7818.94s -> 7819.90s]  Jesus Christ.
[7823.72s -> 7824.92s]  He's not...
[7826.20s -> 7826.68s]  He's not...
[7826.68s -> 7827.16s]  He's...
[7827.16s -> 7827.88s]  No, he's not.
[7827.88s -> 7828.36s]  He's...
[7828.36s -> 7829.08s]  He's...
[7829.08s -> 7829.72s]  How old are you?
[7829.72s -> 7830.20s]  All right.
[7830.20s -> 7830.52s]  All right.
[7830.52s -> 7831.16s]  Let's go.
[7831.16s -> 7831.64s]  Let's go.
[7831.64s -> 7832.12s]  Let's go.
[7832.12s -> 7832.92s]  Let's go.
[7832.92s -> 7834.76s]  No, it's for the invisible wizard.
[7834.76s -> 7836.12s]  She just moved it next door.
[7838.09s -> 7840.49s]  People saying he's not old enough to work.
[7841.21s -> 7842.89s]  Yes, he's like 38.
[7846.50s -> 7848.82s]  Why am I asking an imaginary person
[7849.62s -> 7852.34s]  if they're old enough to be working for me?
[7853.74s -> 7855.02s]  So, I'm done.
[7856.49s -> 7857.37s]  Oh, dear.
[7857.37s -> 7860.04s]  The party hats.
[7860.04s -> 7860.76s]  Pardon?
[7860.76s -> 7867.34s]  Every time we throw a parade, everyone has a party hat.
[7867.34s -> 7869.10s]  Mine was ruined at the last parade.
[7869.10s -> 7871.94s]  He is real. I know.
[7871.94s -> 7875.67s]  I've been too busy working at my shop to buy a new one.
[7875.67s -> 7876.92s]  Oh, no.
[7876.92s -> 7877.88s]  How embarrassing.
[7877.88s -> 7879.96s]  I can't show up to the parade without one.
[7879.96s -> 7882.52s]  Do you think it's too late to order one online?
[7882.52s -> 7885.08s]  It'll be tight.
[7885.08s -> 7885.64s]  You're right.
[7885.64s -> 7887.69s]  Oh, what should I do?
[7887.69s -> 7888.81s]  Don't stress.
[7888.81s -> 7891.05s]  I'll track one down for you before the parade starts.
[7896.76s -> 7899.22s]  Oh, my fucking stomach.
[7899.22s -> 7900.58s]  Oh, this is fucking...
[7900.58s -> 7901.38s]  This is killing me.
[7903.45s -> 7905.05s]  Everyone's going to point it out now.
[7905.05s -> 7906.49s]  Oh, my gosh. Thank you, detective.
[7906.49s -> 7908.65s]  In the meantime, I'll figure out a way to repay you.
[7908.65s -> 7912.71s]  Unfortunately, I don't have any frog portraits just yet.
[7912.71s -> 7914.71s]  Not a problem.
[7914.71s -> 7916.38s]  What would you like to know?
[7916.38s -> 7917.10s]  That's all.
[7917.10s -> 7930.95s]  Can you please check on their leg?
[7930.95s -> 7932.79s]  Is it still swollen?
[7934.25s -> 7935.61s]  Oh, my god.
[7939.11s -> 7948.47s]  This is so fucked up.
[7948.47s -> 7950.87s]  Okay, we have two or three more characters to introduce.
[7953.03s -> 7956.15s]  And they're all going to have normal ass voices, by the way.
[7956.31s -> 7957.99s]  Ahem.
[7957.99s -> 7960.02s]  You're the detective, right?
[7960.02s -> 7960.74s]  I'm Mandy.
[7961.30s -> 7962.02s]  Hi, Mandy.
[7962.66s -> 7964.36s]  Be careful where you step, detective.
[7965.00s -> 7966.52s]  There is mess everywhere.
[7966.52s -> 7968.04s]  I'm used to mess.
[7969.03s -> 7970.31s]  Lucky you, I'm not.
[7970.87s -> 7972.57s]  My shoes are brand new.
[7972.57s -> 7973.69s]  I can't get them dirty.
[7974.33s -> 7976.25s]  Why don't you change shoes?
[7976.25s -> 7980.02s]  Detective, are you joking?
[7980.58s -> 7984.82s]  I can't wear flats with this look.
[7984.82s -> 7986.98s]  Proportions would be all wrong.
[7987.70s -> 7989.88s]  Besides, these shoes are enchanted.
[7990.87s -> 7991.67s]  Oh.
[7991.67s -> 7995.72s]  I'm one of the few actual witches here in Warlock Woods.
[7996.28s -> 7998.52s]  Most folks here are just fans of the spooky.
[7999.08s -> 8004.17s]  Which is fine and all, but it means a lot of the cleaning work will be mine to do.
[8004.17s -> 8008.30s]  I never should have learned that tidying up spell.
[8008.30s -> 8010.46s]  It shouldn't take too long for me to clean up this mess,
[8010.46s -> 8012.46s]  but first I need to find all my pies.
[8013.51s -> 8015.43s]  I haven't seen pies.
[8015.43s -> 8016.79s]  Same thing that happened everywhere.
[8016.79s -> 8019.11s]  Someone thought it'd be funny to knock them all over.
[8019.11s -> 8020.44s]  Vandals.
[8020.44s -> 8021.90s]  So annoying.
[8021.90s -> 8024.58s]  I spent ages making them.
[8024.58s -> 8027.29s]  Oh, I see.
[8027.29s -> 8030.58s]  Well, do you mind if I ask you some questions?
[8030.58s -> 8034.79s]  Tell me what you want to know about your pies.
[8034.79s -> 8038.20s]  Do you need help finding your pies?
[8039.26s -> 8039.98s]  Yes.
[8039.98s -> 8041.42s]  Detective, seriously.
[8041.42s -> 8043.50s]  I seriously need help.
[8043.50s -> 8044.46s]  Straight up.
[8044.46s -> 8046.36s]  I can't see anything right now.
[8046.36s -> 8049.75s]  These glasses are so dark it's unreal.
[8049.75s -> 8053.82s]  I'm such a dingus.
[8053.82s -> 8058.30s]  I'm such a dingus.
[8058.30s -> 8059.10s]  Holy fuck.
[8059.10s -> 8061.38s]  It's nice.
[8061.38s -> 8061.94s]  Nice.
[8062.58s -> 8063.54s]  That's a cool...
[8063.54s -> 8070.09s]  Nobody says that.
[8070.09s -> 8076.12s]  This town is literally cloaked in eternal night.
[8076.12s -> 8078.26s]  I do.
[8078.26s -> 8079.50s]  No, you don't.
[8079.50s -> 8079.90s]  I do.
[8080.46s -> 8081.91s]  That's my thing.
[8081.91s -> 8082.87s]  No, that's my thing.
[8082.87s -> 8084.63s]  Don't stop talking about other people that say that.
[8084.63s -> 8085.11s]  That's my thing.
[8085.11s -> 8086.39s]  It's a German 985 channel thing.
[8086.39s -> 8086.95s]  It's my thing.
[8088.15s -> 8089.27s]  Let's talk about the people that do that.
[8089.27s -> 8091.40s]  It's my thing.
[8091.40s -> 8092.52s]  Oh, this person does it too.
[8092.52s -> 8093.64s]  No, it's my thing.
[8093.64s -> 8095.58s]  They can't do it.
[8095.58s -> 8098.15s]  Why do I think sunglasses would be a good idea?
[8098.15s -> 8100.02s]  They weren't a good idea.
[8100.02s -> 8102.14s]  However, I don't regret it.
[8102.14s -> 8103.86s]  They make me look amazing.
[8103.86s -> 8106.82s]  Do you think I look amazing?
[8106.82s -> 8108.46s]  Thanks, I do too.
[8108.46s -> 8110.54s]  Worst purchase I've ever made in terms of practicality,
[8110.54s -> 8112.14s]  but it brings this look to a new level.
[8112.14s -> 8115.22s]  I may be a dingus,
[8115.22s -> 8117.22s]  but I'm very stylish dingus.
[8117.22s -> 8123.29s]  What were you talking about?
[8123.29s -> 8124.55s]  My outfit.
[8124.55s -> 8125.03s]  No, no, no.
[8125.03s -> 8127.29s]  Before that.
[8127.29s -> 8128.73s]  Pies.
[8128.73s -> 8128.97s]  Right.
[8128.97s -> 8130.81s]  You offered to help pick up my pies.
[8130.81s -> 8133.05s]  I'm missing quite a few.
[8133.05s -> 8134.78s]  If you could bring them to me,
[8134.78s -> 8136.86s]  I'd be happy to clean them up all up
[8136.86s -> 8138.30s]  and give you one as payment.
[8138.30s -> 8138.86s]  Pie.
[8138.86s -> 8142.62s]  Okay, so sounds like fun.
[8143.26s -> 8143.58s]  Neat.
[8143.58s -> 8144.38s]  Thanks, detective.
[8144.38s -> 8145.66s]  Tell me what you want to know.
[8145.66s -> 8149.34s]  I need a pie.
[8149.34s -> 8149.66s]  All right.
[8149.66s -> 8155.93s]  So we're going to put another circle here.
[8155.93s -> 8159.61s]  Mandy needs help finding her five pies.
[8159.61s -> 8161.13s]  Okay, we can just run around and find them, right?
[8161.13s -> 8165.77s]  I'm going to knock them over.
[8165.77s -> 8167.21s]  Schooled me about fashion, fair enough.
[8167.21s -> 8168.81s]  Real.
[8168.81s -> 8170.09s]  Ask her about the wisdom.
[8170.17s -> 8174.07s]  All right.
[8174.07s -> 8179.19s]  Oh, can I?
[8179.19s -> 8181.05s]  Where were you last night?
[8181.05s -> 8183.13s]  Doing heaps of pushups and getting ripped.
[8183.13s -> 8183.93s]  Just kidding.
[8183.93s -> 8187.86s]  I was on wizbay.net where magic happens, TM.
[8187.86s -> 8189.51s]  How are you doing?
[8189.51s -> 8191.59s]  Bidding on some new shoes.
[8191.59s -> 8194.34s]  Oh, you just got those ones?
[8194.34s -> 8195.54s]  Yeah, but the ones I was bidding on
[8195.54s -> 8199.61s]  would go super well with this blue dress I have.
[8199.61s -> 8200.57s]  Wow, cool.
[8200.57s -> 8201.77s]  I know.
[8201.77s -> 8203.30s]  I didn't win though.
[8203.30s -> 8205.94s]  Who got shoes?
[8205.94s -> 8206.34s]  Not sure.
[8206.34s -> 8207.94s]  All I know is their screen name.
[8207.94s -> 8212.07s]  Someone called DizzyWizzy109.
[8212.07s -> 8212.95s]  Sorry to hear it.
[8212.95s -> 8215.80s]  How did you feel when you lost?
[8215.80s -> 8218.55s]  A bit defeated.
[8218.55s -> 8220.71s]  I went for a midnight stroll to cool off,
[8220.71s -> 8223.67s]  but then I saw someone in the distance.
[8223.67s -> 8227.11s]  It was a pretty, it was a pretty froggy night,
[8227.11s -> 8228.15s]  so I couldn't see much,
[8228.15s -> 8230.47s]  but they were carrying a large box.
[8230.47s -> 8232.63s]  I couldn't see what they looked like,
[8232.63s -> 8234.92s]  but they definitely weren't from here.
[8234.92s -> 8236.68s]  It felt like they were waiting for someone.
[8236.68s -> 8239.18s]  I didn't think too much of it and went home.
[8239.18s -> 8244.71s]  Did you hear any noise after that?
[8244.71s -> 8246.70s]  No, my house is soundproof.
[8246.70s -> 8248.22s]  Ever since Mary has taken up singing,
[8248.22s -> 8249.82s]  it's kind of a necessity around here.
[8249.82s -> 8252.50s]  I only saw the mess in the morning.
[8252.50s -> 8253.22s]  Interesting.
[8253.22s -> 8255.54s]  Tell me what you want to know.
[8255.54s -> 8259.34s]  Fucking easy.
[8259.34s -> 8264.95s]  This is gonna be fucking easy.
[8264.95s -> 8269.34s]  Oh, look, DizzyWizzy109 is in chat.
[8269.34s -> 8269.98s]  Nice.
[8269.98s -> 8271.58s]  All right, we're gonna find somebody
[8271.58s -> 8272.46s]  with that screen name.
[8272.46s -> 8280.01s]  Is this the last person?
[8280.01s -> 8280.97s]  This is it, right?
[8280.97s -> 8285.53s]  Where's the, all right, what do we got here?
[8286.47s -> 8291.91s]  Let me like take, ooh, lost pie.
[8291.91s -> 8294.07s]  I got a lost pie.
[8294.07s -> 8295.46s]  Nice.
[8295.46s -> 8300.54s]  I need five of these?
[8300.54s -> 8302.30s]  I have not absorbed a single piece of information
[8302.30s -> 8303.42s]  this game has ever put forth.
[8303.42s -> 8305.58s]  I know, and that's my fault,
[8305.58s -> 8308.14s]  because I've just been fucking all this up
[8308.14s -> 8308.94s]  with voices and stuff,
[8308.94s -> 8309.98s]  and you can't even pay attention.
[8309.98s -> 8311.02s]  I'm sorry about that.
[8311.02s -> 8311.98s]  I have no idea what's going on.
[8312.62s -> 8315.10s]  This is the only task I remembered.
[8319.13s -> 8319.69s]  Two pies.
[8320.33s -> 8326.15s]  Oh.
[8326.15s -> 8327.35s]  Hey, Reindeer.
[8328.31s -> 8329.43s]  Hey, Reindeer.
[8330.55s -> 8331.11s]  Reindeer.
[8335.96s -> 8336.46s]  Hi.
[8337.24s -> 8338.36s]  Hello.
[8339.16s -> 8339.96s]  Wanna hop in?
[8341.98s -> 8342.62s]  A little bit.
[8343.26s -> 8345.35s]  But I'm on a case.
[8346.07s -> 8347.21s]  Oh, cool.
[8347.93s -> 8348.65s]  I'm Victor.
[8348.65s -> 8349.13s]  Who are you?
[8350.68s -> 8351.32s]  The detective.
[8352.54s -> 8353.66s]  Is that your real name?
[8355.32s -> 8355.72s]  Maybe.
[8357.13s -> 8358.17s]  Cool, cool, cool.
[8358.17s -> 8359.29s]  Are you here to question me
[8359.29s -> 8360.09s]  and investigate stuff?
[8360.65s -> 8362.09s]  Because, like, I'm not suspicious.
[8362.73s -> 8365.64s]  How do you know you're not suspicious?
[8368.66s -> 8371.42s]  Well, I think I didn't do it.
[8373.32s -> 8373.82s]  You think?
[8375.02s -> 8375.98s]  Yeah, nobody knows anything
[8375.98s -> 8377.02s]  for certain these days.
[8382.46s -> 8384.76s]  So why are you here swimming?
[8384.76s -> 8386.36s]  I'm visiting my friend Naughty.
[8388.38s -> 8390.04s]  Oh.
[8390.04s -> 8392.28s]  She's the only person I know with a hot tub.
[8392.28s -> 8393.88s]  She's the only person I know with a hot tub.
[8393.88s -> 8396.84s]  Do you remember the fucking voice from last one?
[8396.84s -> 8399.50s]  Well, I heard they were gonna be delicious pies
[8399.50s -> 8400.14s]  for the parade,
[8400.14s -> 8401.10s]  and the timing was perfect.
[8403.37s -> 8409.21s]  YouTuber Jim Carrey.
[8409.21s -> 8411.45s]  Now, just because I opened it up with, like,
[8411.61s -> 8412.25s]  Hello!
[8413.45s -> 8414.09s]  Do not!
[8415.53s -> 8416.25s]  That was Jim Carrey.
[8416.25s -> 8416.57s]  It was.
[8416.57s -> 8416.73s]  All right.
[8416.73s -> 8417.77s]  But just because I did that doesn't mean
[8417.77s -> 8419.05s]  the character is Jim Carrey.
[8419.05s -> 8424.89s]  Where do you live normally?
[8424.89s -> 8427.26s]  Over near Pumpkinville.
[8427.26s -> 8427.82s]  Nice spot.
[8427.82s -> 8429.10s]  I was thinking of taking a holiday there
[8429.10s -> 8429.90s]  at some point.
[8429.90s -> 8432.33s]  Yeah, it's fine.
[8432.33s -> 8437.43s]  Yeah.
[8437.43s -> 8440.76s]  Um, so, can I ask you a question about anything?
[8440.76s -> 8441.72s]  Yeah, whatever.
[8441.72s -> 8444.28s]  Otto3, questions.
[8444.28s -> 8444.89s]  All right.
[8444.89s -> 8445.69s]  What'd you do last night?
[8445.69s -> 8446.57s]  Do you need anything?
[8446.57s -> 8452.62s]  Where were you when the parade was destroyed?
[8452.62s -> 8454.58s]  Well, I had been swimming all day
[8454.58s -> 8455.94s]  in Naughty's hot tub,
[8455.94s -> 8457.30s]  so I was super wrinkly.
[8458.54s -> 8459.86s]  Yep.
[8459.86s -> 8462.02s]  And it was hard for me to get inside the house
[8462.02s -> 8464.49s]  because of my wrinkly hooves.
[8464.49s -> 8466.09s]  Uh-huh.
[8466.09s -> 8468.41s]  So I waited for about a half an hour
[8468.41s -> 8471.45s]  for the wrinkles to de-wrinkle.
[8471.45s -> 8472.78s]  Yep.
[8472.78s -> 8474.70s]  And then I went inside to Naughty's house
[8474.70s -> 8478.55s]  and snoozed on the couch all night.
[8478.55s -> 8480.52s]  What time was that?
[8480.52s -> 8481.94s]  All night.
[8481.94s -> 8484.55s]  No, I mean, what time?
[8487.00s -> 8487.64s]  That is not the time.
[8487.64s -> 8488.68s]  What time do you close?
[8488.68s -> 8490.84s]  What time do you get back into the house?
[8490.84s -> 8492.31s]  I gotta stop doing that.
[8492.31s -> 8493.11s]  I gotta stop fucking...
[8493.11s -> 8497.86s]  I can't do No Country for All Men every half day.
[8497.86s -> 8499.38s]  Before the parade was destroyed,
[8499.38s -> 8500.34s]  it wasn't me.
[8500.34s -> 8505.14s]  Probably wasn't me, I mean.
[8505.14s -> 8506.10s]  Can't be sure.
[8506.10s -> 8510.73s]  But 90% probability that it wasn't me.
[8510.73s -> 8511.77s]  Questions, you have them.
[8511.77s -> 8519.16s]  Stop talking in voices.
[8519.16s -> 8520.36s]  For fuck's sake.
[8520.36s -> 8522.10s]  Stop talking in voices.
[8522.10s -> 8522.90s]  For fuck's sake.
[8530.41s -> 8530.97s]  One guy.
[8532.33s -> 8538.46s]  Did you know about the invisible wizard
[8538.46s -> 8539.02s]  before you get...
[8539.02s -> 8547.56s]  What if I started going, even why?
[8547.56s -> 8548.12s]  Not really.
[8548.12s -> 8549.16s]  I knew the parade was for her,
[8549.16s -> 8551.99s]  but beyond that, I know a lot.
[8551.99s -> 8556.22s]  I'm begging you, do that.
[8556.22s -> 8557.34s]  Talk in tongues.
[8562.94s -> 8564.22s]  Just going nuts.
[8565.91s -> 8567.19s]  I think a lot more people would leave
[8567.19s -> 8570.58s]  if I did that one.
[8570.58s -> 8571.86s]  Annoying that they never threw a parade
[8571.86s -> 8574.97s]  for me coming to visit.
[8574.97s -> 8576.25s]  I'm super cool.
[8576.25s -> 8579.38s]  Have you been here before?
[8579.38s -> 8580.26s]  So many times.
[8580.26s -> 8585.40s]  The first time they even threw me a parade.
[8585.40s -> 8586.62s]  Okay.
[8586.62s -> 8588.22s]  I take the parade thing back.
[8588.22s -> 8591.74s]  Just pretend I didn't say that.
[8591.74s -> 8592.22s]  Sure.
[8592.22s -> 8595.30s]  Detective, I'm really bored of this conversation.
[8595.30s -> 8596.50s]  I'm sorry if that's rude,
[8596.50s -> 8598.50s]  but I have a new policy of being honest with people.
[8598.50s -> 8602.15s]  Were you dishonest before?
[8602.15s -> 8603.11s]  Yeah, I guess.
[8603.11s -> 8606.73s]  I wouldn't tell people when they were boring me.
[8606.73s -> 8608.57s]  I don't think that counts as dishonesty.
[8608.57s -> 8611.26s]  What am I supposed to do when people are boring?
[8611.26s -> 8612.18s]  I don't know.
[8612.18s -> 8612.82s]  Leave the stream.
[8614.41s -> 8615.69s]  Find somebody else to watch.
[8620.70s -> 8621.90s]  But probably don't tell them.
[8622.86s -> 8624.94s]  It would hurt their feelings.
[8624.94s -> 8630.86s]  I didn't hurt your feelings though, did I?
[8630.86s -> 8635.02s]  Well, I have to admit I was a bit hurt.
[8635.02s -> 8637.02s]  I have a very exciting job and I'm a frog.
[8637.02s -> 8641.42s]  I like to solve mysteries.
[8641.42s -> 8643.10s]  I don't think I'm boring at all.
[8643.10s -> 8647.90s]  Well, Jerma was hired to voice act this entire game.
[8647.90s -> 8648.86s]  Yeah, dude.
[8648.86s -> 8650.36s]  Yeah.
[8650.36s -> 8652.68s]  I'm full of energy today, if you couldn't tell.
[8652.68s -> 8656.82s]  This game sucks.
[8656.82s -> 8660.86s]  All right, actually ban that person for five minutes.
[8660.86s -> 8662.54s]  I want them to sit there and think about it.
[8662.54s -> 8663.02s]  It should be like...
[8665.67s -> 8671.58s]  And then they can talk again.
[8671.58s -> 8673.26s]  Plus, I've solved my fair share of crimes.
[8673.82s -> 8674.94s]  What crimes?
[8674.94s -> 8675.42s]  This one.
[8678.79s -> 8680.15s]  You've solved the crime already?
[8681.08s -> 8683.19s]  Yeah, Ralph did it.
[8683.19s -> 8683.83s]  How do you know?
[8687.62s -> 8688.82s]  Good point.
[8688.82s -> 8690.76s]  I haven't decided that bit yet.
[8690.76s -> 8692.44s]  But it seems likely that he did.
[8692.44s -> 8694.20s]  What was his motive?
[8695.16s -> 8695.64s]  His what?
[8697.32s -> 8700.36s]  Motive, the reason for destroying something.
[8700.36s -> 8706.62s]  Oh, I think it's because he has an iPad on.
[8706.62s -> 8707.74s]  This is a great stream.
[8707.74s -> 8709.26s]  You guys are smoking crack.
[8709.74s -> 8717.42s]  You guys are smoking crack.
[8728.82s -> 8730.02s]  You guys are smoking.
[8731.37s -> 8732.49s]  Don't smoke crack.
[8732.49s -> 8733.45s]  That's not good for you.
[8734.17s -> 8737.78s]  I don't think that's a motive.
[8737.78s -> 8738.82s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[8739.62s -> 8740.74s]  Wow, who's the rude one?
[8741.30s -> 8742.02s]  This conversation...
[8742.74s -> 8743.46s]  I'm just...
[8743.46s -> 8743.86s]  Let's go.
[8744.74s -> 8745.30s]  I just...
[8745.30s -> 8751.24s]  We're just sitting here going back and forth saying the same three sentences.
[8751.24s -> 8751.96s]  I mean it.
[8751.96s -> 8753.72s]  I just get so grumpy when I'm hungry.
[8753.72s -> 8756.20s]  Why don't you eat something and get out of the hot tub?
[8756.20s -> 8756.92s]  No, I just...
[8756.92s -> 8758.44s]  I must continue to soak.
[8759.00s -> 8761.00s]  You could ask someone to get you something to eat.
[8761.00s -> 8762.25s]  Like who?
[8762.25s -> 8764.66s]  There is nobody here.
[8764.66s -> 8765.22s]  I am here.
[8765.22s -> 8766.66s]  I have to get him something to eat.
[8766.66s -> 8767.30s]  Right there.
[8767.30s -> 8768.66s]  I go being rude again.
[8768.66s -> 8771.91s]  If you happen to find food, I would love to have some.
[8771.91s -> 8774.47s]  In the meantime, I would like to apologize for being so rude.
[8774.47s -> 8778.63s]  Please take one money as an apology.
[8778.63s -> 8779.19s]  Nice.
[8779.19s -> 8786.34s]  Wait, give item?
[8786.34s -> 8787.69s]  Lost?
[8787.69s -> 8792.71s]  Should I give him a pie?
[8792.71s -> 8793.03s]  Is this...
[8793.83s -> 8795.03s]  Should I not give him a pie?
[8798.86s -> 8800.06s]  No, no, no, no.
[8800.06s -> 8802.06s]  No, he doesn't deserve it.
[8803.62s -> 8804.34s]  He doesn't deserve it.
[8806.50s -> 8807.22s]  No, it's not.
[8807.22s -> 8808.26s]  It's not your pie.
[8811.19s -> 8813.11s]  Am I going to give this pie back that was on the ground
[8813.11s -> 8814.63s]  and then this person is going to sell it for money
[8814.63s -> 8816.23s]  and the person is going to eat something that was on the ground?
[8819.51s -> 8820.15s]  Very rude.
[8823.40s -> 8824.76s]  Rude because of hunger.
[8824.76s -> 8826.44s]  Maybe just rude in general doesn't live here.
[8826.44s -> 8830.63s]  Okay.
[8830.63s -> 8831.83s]  Smoke and crack.
[8832.55s -> 8835.96s]  All right, we got...
[8835.96s -> 8837.24s]  How many pies do we need?
[8837.24s -> 8837.80s]  We need five.
[8837.80s -> 8838.28s]  What do I have?
[8838.28s -> 8838.52s]  Two?
[8839.16s -> 8840.68s]  How much does this stuff cost in the store?
[8841.48s -> 8842.12s]  That's too expensive.
[8842.12s -> 8843.32s]  How am I going to ever afford this stuff?
[8845.03s -> 8846.23s]  Six dollars for a sheep?
[8847.03s -> 8849.99s]  Hello, wizard.
[8850.55s -> 8851.80s]  All right, I haven't talked to you.
[8874.09s -> 8875.77s]  Hello?
[8877.16s -> 8879.56s]  Hello, frog.
[8880.60s -> 8881.56s]  That was there.
[8881.56s -> 8882.84s]  That was a fucking softball.
[8883.48s -> 8885.83s]  Hello.
[8885.83s -> 8886.55s]  What's your name?
[8887.42s -> 8888.22s]  I'm Mary.
[8889.02s -> 8889.58s]  Nice to meet...
[8889.58s -> 8890.14s]  Same person.
[8890.78s -> 8891.50s]  Nice to meet you.
[8892.65s -> 8893.13s]  You too.
[8893.69s -> 8894.65s]  Did you like my song?
[8895.77s -> 8896.57s]  Yep.
[8896.57s -> 8900.04s]  I've been practicing all day and all night.
[8900.04s -> 8900.84s]  Oh, are you okay?
[8901.56s -> 8904.60s]  He's getting embarrassed from this.
[8911.27s -> 8914.44s]  Turn on mic distortion for one of these.
[8917.08s -> 8917.88s]  All right, fine.
[8920.78s -> 8927.66s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[8928.38s -> 8929.34s]  I guess it's...
[8929.34s -> 8930.38s]  How's this one sound?
[8930.94s -> 8932.46s]  This is a pretty good sounding one.
[8933.74s -> 8934.54s]  Not a bad one.
[8935.34s -> 8936.66s]  Okay.
[8938.49s -> 8939.37s]  I'm tired.
[8941.86s -> 8943.06s]  Maybe you should get some sleep.
[8944.87s -> 8945.75s]  Maybe.
[8947.24s -> 8948.52s]  You sing very loudly.
[8951.02s -> 8953.58s]  I'm why everyone's soundproof their houses.
[8955.29s -> 8956.33s]  That sounds expensive.
[8958.20s -> 8961.22s]  Yeah, but that's not really my problem.
[8962.42s -> 8964.82s]  I think I sound very good even late at night.
[8966.62s -> 8967.18s]  How late?
[8968.62s -> 8973.51s]  I love to sing at 3 a.m.
[8973.51s -> 8974.15s]  Wow.
[8974.15s -> 8977.30s]  That's when my energy is the highest.
[8978.84s -> 8980.12s]  That doesn't sound very healthy.
[8981.75s -> 8983.03s]  My health is my business.
[8984.22s -> 8985.10s]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[8986.44s -> 8986.84s]  Sorry.
[8988.55s -> 8989.19s]  That's okay.
[8990.22s -> 8992.94s]  Maybe I should listen to some soft sounds before bed.
[8993.58s -> 8998.20s]  Welcome to my hair salon.
[8998.76s -> 9003.00s]  That will be 100 money.
[9006.06s -> 9006.78s]  Just joking.
[9007.72s -> 9009.00s]  Anyway, who are you?
[9010.25s -> 9010.97s]  I'm the detective.
[9011.98s -> 9012.86s]  Oh, cool.
[9012.86s -> 9013.90s]  Can you question me?
[9015.80s -> 9016.68s]  Do you mind if I ask?
[9017.24s -> 9017.96s]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[9018.89s -> 9019.37s]  Oh, boy.
[9019.37s -> 9020.65s]  I love questions.
[9020.65s -> 9026.94s]  What do you know about the wizard that moved in?
[9026.94s -> 9027.50s]  Wrong voice.
[9032.73s -> 9033.05s]  Yeah.
[9034.66s -> 9035.38s]  Oh, sorry.
[9035.38s -> 9036.58s]  I didn't actually hear you.
[9038.17s -> 9039.53s]  I was asking about the wizard.
[9040.58s -> 9043.02s]  Oh, yeah, there's a wizard.
[9043.66s -> 9044.70s]  She just moved in.
[9045.90s -> 9047.46s]  Why?
[9047.46s -> 9048.34s]  I'm a detective.
[9049.14s -> 9049.54s]  Right.
[9050.26s -> 9051.78s]  This is part of the questioning, right?
[9052.73s -> 9052.97s]  Yes.
[9054.55s -> 9055.03s]  Cool.
[9055.03s -> 9055.35s]  Cool.
[9056.15s -> 9058.63s]  So I didn't do any crimes or anything.
[9059.45s -> 9062.46s]  And I have the right to remain silent.
[9062.46s -> 9062.70s]  Yeah.
[9062.70s -> 9064.22s]  But did you want to remain silent?
[9067.13s -> 9069.18s]  Literally never.
[9069.18s -> 9074.81s]  So like, I heard that Ralph was super weird about the new wizard moving in.
[9074.81s -> 9079.53s]  Also, I heard that Mandy was in a bad mood the night the parade was destroyed.
[9083.93s -> 9089.37s]  And I heard that Naughty, like, attacked the wizard one time.
[9090.74s -> 9093.46s]  And that's all, actually.
[9093.46s -> 9097.93s]  Does this make me a snitch?
[9097.93s -> 9099.66s]  I think so.
[9099.66s -> 9100.14s]  Rats.
[9101.45s -> 9103.13s]  Oh, boy, I love questions.
[9103.85s -> 9110.58s]  What were you doing when the parade was destroyed?
[9112.23s -> 9114.15s]  Oh, boy, yeah.
[9115.40s -> 9119.69s]  Sucks that the parade was destroyed.
[9119.69s -> 9122.41s]  Oh, we're doing questioning.
[9122.41s -> 9123.67s]  What was I doing?
[9124.23s -> 9125.27s]  Not much.
[9125.27s -> 9126.95s]  Just singing outside.
[9126.95s -> 9133.62s]  You were outside when the parade was destroyed?
[9133.62s -> 9135.94s]  Yeah.
[9135.94s -> 9136.90s]  Did you see anything?
[9138.41s -> 9138.73s]  Yeah.
[9140.25s -> 9140.81s]  What did you see?
[9141.37s -> 9147.69s]  Detective, have you heard of extortion?
[9147.69s -> 9148.01s]  Yes.
[9149.45s -> 9150.65s]  That's great news.
[9153.00s -> 9153.40s]  Is it?
[9155.18s -> 9159.26s]  Detective, I would like to extort you.
[9159.26s -> 9162.34s]  I don't think that's legal.
[9162.34s -> 9167.11s]  I am above the law.
[9168.90s -> 9173.98s]  Oh, why are you extorting me?
[9173.98s -> 9180.95s]  I would like five money for a train ticket.
[9180.95s -> 9184.50s]  I don't have any money.
[9184.50s -> 9186.98s]  Well, you best get some soon.
[9188.63s -> 9189.91s]  It was her.
[9189.91s -> 9191.11s]  It was her.
[9191.11s -> 9191.75s]  It was her.
[9191.75s -> 9192.55s]  She did it.
[9192.55s -> 9197.13s]  What do you need a train ticket for?
[9197.13s -> 9198.25s]  He's getting bored.
[9198.25s -> 9201.37s]  No, just shh.
[9201.37s -> 9207.14s]  I want to go to Froggy.
[9209.58s -> 9210.86s]  I just broke this shit.
[9212.78s -> 9213.34s]  I'm sorry.
[9214.30s -> 9215.90s]  This is actually the knob.
[9215.90s -> 9216.78s]  The knob slipped.
[9219.26s -> 9223.11s]  I want to go to Froggy Wood and become a star.
[9223.99s -> 9226.28s]  Oh, that sounds exciting.
[9226.28s -> 9227.40s]  I know, right?
[9227.48s -> 9231.00s]  Sorry about the extortion thing, but I don't really have many other ways to get there.
[9231.88s -> 9234.84s]  I figure if you get the money from me, I can finally go and live my dreams.
[9238.02s -> 9238.90s]  Do I have to do this?
[9246.47s -> 9247.66s]  I'm not doing that.
[9247.66s -> 9249.69s]  What will you give me in exchange?
[9256.54s -> 9257.18s]  He's getting bored.
[9257.18s -> 9257.50s]  Fuck.
[9257.50s -> 9257.82s]  Hold on.
[9258.63s -> 9259.43s]  I'm not getting bored.
[9262.34s -> 9263.38s]  What kind of information?
[9264.20s -> 9264.92s]  A phone number.
[9265.82s -> 9266.94s]  Who am I calling?
[9266.94s -> 9268.06s]  I can't tell you that.
[9268.06s -> 9271.58s]  All I can say is that they were in the vicinity when the parade was destroyed.
[9271.58s -> 9273.90s]  I don't think you'll be able to solve the case without this phone number.
[9274.62s -> 9276.36s]  Hence the extortion.
[9276.36s -> 9277.24s]  Sorry.
[9277.24s -> 9278.55s]  It's okay.
[9278.55s -> 9280.23s]  We all get extorted every now and then.
[9282.79s -> 9283.03s]  Yeah.
[9284.49s -> 9288.01s]  Anyway, come back to me when you have my money.
[9288.97s -> 9290.97s]  Oh boy, I love questions.
[9294.84s -> 9295.48s]  Five dollars?
[9296.12s -> 9298.36s]  Do Robo Bernie.
[9298.36s -> 9299.08s]  Oh my god.
[9299.72s -> 9306.26s]  Perhaps the wizard is a better singer than her.
[9309.14s -> 9309.54s]  Bernie.
[9311.06s -> 9311.70s]  Bernie.
[9311.70s -> 9312.74s]  Robo Bernie.
[9312.74s -> 9313.38s]  I can't.
[9315.22s -> 9317.62s]  I can't have this be three hours of Bernie Sanders.
[9318.58s -> 9319.94s]  With like sprinkling.
[9319.94s -> 9323.86s]  Sprinkle in like a baby voice and like Donald Trump and then some Obama.
[9323.86s -> 9325.38s]  Like I can't have three hours.
[9325.38s -> 9326.82s]  I can't have three hours of Bernie.
[9326.82s -> 9327.54s]  We can't do that.
[9328.26s -> 9330.15s]  All right.
[9330.15s -> 9331.19s]  I need to buy those pies.
[9331.75s -> 9341.21s]  What about the corn chips?
[9341.21s -> 9341.69s]  Whatever they are.
[9342.25s -> 9343.50s]  Should I pick these up?
[9343.50s -> 9344.38s]  Oh, there's a pie.
[9349.08s -> 9350.76s]  Four hours of Dean Dingus.
[9351.40s -> 9354.09s]  Finally some good fucking food.
[9358.90s -> 9360.02s]  God damn it, man.
[9363.30s -> 9363.54s]  All right.
[9363.54s -> 9364.02s]  What have we got?
[9364.58s -> 9365.70s]  I need two more pies.
[9365.70s -> 9366.26s]  What was that?
[9368.76s -> 9369.32s]  You see that?
[9369.88s -> 9375.86s]  I can't go in it.
[9375.86s -> 9376.90s]  Wait, I can go in the houses?
[9378.78s -> 9379.74s]  Hello, is anyone home?
[9380.82s -> 9383.14s]  Sounds like somebody's inside, but I shouldn't intrude on.
[9383.14s -> 9384.18s]  I'll come back another time.
[9386.41s -> 9387.45s]  Hurry up and investigate.
[9387.45s -> 9388.49s]  What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
[9395.34s -> 9396.14s]  You're a detective.
[9397.99s -> 9399.91s]  Yeah, and I'm I'm detectiving.
[9399.91s -> 9400.71s]  What do you think I'm doing?
[9405.02s -> 9405.66s]  This is the wizard.
[9405.66s -> 9406.22s]  Yeah, I know.
[9411.78s -> 9412.74s]  I need two more pies.
[9413.54s -> 9415.64s]  I have no idea where they are.
[9418.78s -> 9421.10s]  Wow, wow, wowie, wowie, wowie.
[9421.10s -> 9421.34s]  What?
[9427.58s -> 9428.70s]  Look, idiot.
[9428.70s -> 9429.42s]  Look, idiot.
[9429.42s -> 9430.06s]  Look, idiot.
[9430.06s -> 9432.62s]  Look, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.
[9435.56s -> 9436.20s]  Look, idiot.
[9436.20s -> 9437.16s]  He's stupid.
[9437.16s -> 9438.60s]  Look, he's stupid.
[9438.60s -> 9439.72s]  Look, he's stupid.
[9446.23s -> 9447.27s]  In the water?
[9447.27s -> 9450.14s]  There's nothing in the water.
[9450.14s -> 9454.79s]  There's nothing in the water.
[9455.35s -> 9469.67s]  Found one.
[9469.67s -> 9471.98s]  It's a lost pie.
[9471.98s -> 9472.54s]  I need one more.
[9473.10s -> 9474.70s]  There's a huge deer in the water.
[9474.70s -> 9476.22s]  I can see the deer in the water.
[9480.04s -> 9480.60s]  Yeah, I know.
[9480.60s -> 9481.56s]  That's a little strange.
[9484.36s -> 9486.28s]  One more pie and then we can do a turn in.
[9486.92s -> 9489.32s]  Can I take the balloon?
[9492.71s -> 9493.35s]  Got it.
[9493.35s -> 9495.11s]  And go.
[9495.11s -> 9498.04s]  All right, let's do the turn in.
[9498.68s -> 9503.99s]  Five lost pies.
[9507.27s -> 9509.75s]  Streams like this are why I need a therapist.
[9511.19s -> 9511.51s]  What?
[9512.23s -> 9518.84s]  All right, what do you want?
[9518.84s -> 9520.63s]  Uh, here are your pies.
[9521.51s -> 9522.71s]  All five of them.
[9524.60s -> 9525.40s]  Well, all of them?
[9525.96s -> 9526.52s]  I think so.
[9527.24s -> 9528.36s]  Yeah, that looks like all of them.
[9528.36s -> 9530.52s]  Wow, you must have searched far and wide.
[9532.20s -> 9532.44s]  Yes.
[9533.48s -> 9534.68s]  Wowie, thanks, detective.
[9535.85s -> 9537.45s]  Show this stream to the doctor.
[9538.17s -> 9542.33s]  You mean you're going to show this stream to your doctor
[9543.05s -> 9544.89s]  and say something's wrong with me.
[9544.89s -> 9546.01s]  I got something wrong with me here.
[9548.09s -> 9548.65s]  Not me.
[9548.65s -> 9550.33s]  I don't show this one to my doctor.
[9554.44s -> 9556.20s]  Here's one money.
[9556.20s -> 9556.68s]  That's it.
[9557.40s -> 9563.00s]  You didn't promise pain.
[9563.00s -> 9564.44s]  Wait, why one?
[9564.44s -> 9565.64s]  I gave you five pies.
[9566.36s -> 9569.83s]  Oh, I'm not okay.
[9569.83s -> 9570.55s]  I'm not very hungry.
[9570.55s -> 9571.35s]  You can hold on to it.
[9571.35s -> 9571.59s]  What?
[9572.31s -> 9572.87s]  Nonsense.
[9572.87s -> 9574.31s]  Take one and eat it later when you're hungry.
[9574.31s -> 9578.15s]  All right, now we give the pie to the elk.
[9578.15s -> 9580.33s]  Got a pie.
[9580.33s -> 9581.05s]  Pie to the elk.
[9581.69s -> 9582.81s]  Elk gets out of the water.
[9588.86s -> 9589.74s]  That's a good deal.
[9589.74s -> 9591.50s]  One dollar for five pies.
[9592.94s -> 9593.58s]  Done.
[9593.58s -> 9604.54s]  No, my doctor would probably shout bald at me then subscribe to you.
[9607.18s -> 9607.98s]  What?
[9607.98s -> 9613.45s]  I've got something for you.
[9614.98s -> 9615.62s]  Questions.
[9616.50s -> 9617.56s]  Take a pie.
[9618.58s -> 9619.78s]  That's real and true.
[9620.42s -> 9622.50s]  Are you still hungry?
[9622.50s -> 9623.06s]  Yes, very.
[9623.06s -> 9624.42s]  It's making me really rude.
[9624.42s -> 9627.38s]  For example, I think your jumper is outdated.
[9627.38s -> 9631.14s]  Victor, I'm not the most fashionable frog in the world,
[9631.14s -> 9632.10s]  but I like this jumper.
[9632.10s -> 9632.74s]  It's my favorite.
[9633.30s -> 9633.96s]  You're right.
[9633.96s -> 9635.32s]  It's retro, not outdated.
[9635.32s -> 9636.36s]  I'm simply very hungry.
[9637.80s -> 9639.74s]  Here is a pie.
[9639.74s -> 9640.30s]  Seriously?
[9640.30s -> 9641.34s]  Score.
[9641.34s -> 9643.24s]  Yep, please enjoy it.
[9643.24s -> 9644.60s]  Oh my gosh, that was amazing.
[9644.60s -> 9648.14s]  And I feel so much less rude now.
[9648.14s -> 9648.86s]  Really?
[9648.86s -> 9649.91s]  Yep.
[9649.91s -> 9651.85s]  You have beautiful eyes.
[9651.85s -> 9652.33s]  Oh, wow.
[9652.33s -> 9653.05s]  Thank you.
[9653.05s -> 9654.57s]  It's true.
[9654.57s -> 9657.78s]  And I think that color jumper suits you perfectly.
[9657.78s -> 9659.45s]  You're making me blush.
[9659.45s -> 9661.05s]  I should give you something in return for this pie.
[9662.71s -> 9664.79s]  I have a spare party hat I'm not using.
[9664.79s -> 9665.91s]  Maybe you could wear it.
[9665.91s -> 9669.58s]  Alas, my head is simply too weird.
[9669.58s -> 9671.02s]  Well, hold on to it anyways.
[9671.02s -> 9672.89s]  Might come in handy.
[9672.89s -> 9673.45s]  Thanks.
[9673.45s -> 9676.44s]  All right, got a party hat.
[9676.44s -> 9679.00s]  Party hats for somebody who wanted one of these, right?
[9679.00s -> 9681.91s]  Who wanted the party hat?
[9681.91s -> 9683.27s]  Can you please call Bugleberry again?
[9683.27s -> 9685.38s]  No, I fucking blocked him.
[9685.38s -> 9687.06s]  I blocked his number.
[9687.06s -> 9692.49s]  Bugleberry is worse than a telemarketer.
[9692.49s -> 9696.49s]  I get more calls in the middle of dinner from Bugleberry
[9696.49s -> 9700.86s]  than I do from people trying to sell me shit.
[9700.86s -> 9702.14s]  Or take a survey.
[9702.14s -> 9705.38s]  All right, who wanted the party hat?
[9705.38s -> 9706.87s]  Not you.
[9706.87s -> 9709.18s]  You?
[9709.18s -> 9710.46s]  You wanted supplies.
[9710.46s -> 9711.51s]  Who wants it?
[9711.51s -> 9712.15s]  You want a party hat?
[9712.15s -> 9713.11s]  Who want a party hat?
[9713.11s -> 9720.25s]  Need something to fix her sign?
[9720.25s -> 9722.42s]  Want supplies?
[9722.42s -> 9724.70s]  Want some rug?
[9727.11s -> 9731.78s]  All right, Carlos wants a party hat.
[9731.78s -> 9734.65s]  Paul Bugleberry, he's crying.
[9734.65s -> 9735.77s]  He's not crying.
[9735.77s -> 9741.10s]  What would you like to know?
[9741.10s -> 9743.59s]  I have a party hat for you.
[9743.59s -> 9748.01s]  Carlos, I have something for you.
[9748.01s -> 9749.72s]  No way.
[9749.72s -> 9751.45s]  It's a party hat.
[9751.45s -> 9752.01s]  No way.
[9752.87s -> 9754.14s]  Yes way.
[9754.14s -> 9755.50s]  That's epic.
[9755.50s -> 9758.97s]  That's honestly the most epic thing I've heard all day.
[9758.97s -> 9760.09s]  Thanks, detective.
[9760.09s -> 9767.34s]  Hold on, sorry.
[9767.34s -> 9769.98s]  The word epic was said like four times in a row
[9769.98s -> 9772.50s]  and I got a headache.
[9772.50s -> 9773.96s]  Not a problem.
[9773.96s -> 9775.86s]  Incorrect, it was a problem.
[9775.86s -> 9777.37s]  And you solved it.
[9777.37s -> 9780.14s]  Just like a true detective.
[9780.14s -> 9781.75s]  Oh, thanks.
[9781.75s -> 9783.19s]  You've made a fan out of me.
[9783.19s -> 9785.99s]  Here, let me pay you for your work.
[9785.99s -> 9787.19s]  Oh, no, no, that's okay.
[9787.75s -> 9789.91s]  Detective, I insist you take a payment.
[9789.91s -> 9791.27s]  One money should do it.
[9791.27s -> 9797.90s]  Three dollars?
[9797.90s -> 9799.42s]  Carlos just subscribed.
[9799.42s -> 9800.78s]  Thanks for the sub, Carlos.
[9800.78s -> 9801.58s]  Appreciate it.
[9801.58s -> 9805.43s]  Thanks for the sub.
[9805.43s -> 9807.35s]  Welcome to the stream.
[9807.35s -> 9809.72s]  Oh, I also found this rug out back.
[9809.72s -> 9810.84s]  Not sure what it was for,
[9810.84s -> 9812.60s]  but I figured you're good at solving these puzzles.
[9812.60s -> 9815.75s]  All right, now we got a rug.
[9815.75s -> 9816.95s]  Read his sub message.
[9816.95s -> 9826.04s]  I just did.
[9826.04s -> 9828.04s]  Bugleberry just messaged me on AIM.
[9828.04s -> 9828.84s]  He's coming over.
[9830.22s -> 9831.98s]  Don't let Bugleberry over your house.
[9831.98s -> 9834.28s]  He's never going to leave.
[9834.28s -> 9836.97s]  He'll find excuses to stay.
[9836.97s -> 9841.13s]  You'll be there for four hours
[9841.13s -> 9842.25s]  sitting there watching TV
[9842.25s -> 9846.01s]  and you know that he's not going to leave anytime soon,
[9846.01s -> 9847.05s]  but you want him to leave,
[9847.05s -> 9849.85s]  but there's no reason for him to leave
[9849.85s -> 9851.93s]  because you said it was okay for him to come over.
[9851.93s -> 9852.97s]  So you're sitting on the couch,
[9852.97s -> 9854.97s]  both just watching fucking random videos
[9854.97s -> 9857.13s]  or YouTube videos or TV shows.
[9857.13s -> 9861.29s]  It's like, we're not doing anything.
[9861.29s -> 9862.33s]  We're not going anywhere.
[9862.33s -> 9863.61s]  I don't want you to be here anymore,
[9863.61s -> 9866.95s]  but I don't have a reason to make you leave.
[9866.95s -> 9869.24s]  And then out of nowhere,
[9869.24s -> 9870.92s]  you're hoping you don't hear it, but you do.
[9873.96s -> 9874.52s]  You hungry?
[9875.53s -> 9877.53s]  Let's order some food.
[9877.53s -> 9879.69s]  It's like, oh, that's at least another fucking 30 minutes
[9879.69s -> 9882.04s]  before the food to get here.
[9882.04s -> 9883.56s]  And now you're going to be here for like an hour.
[9883.56s -> 9884.68s]  There's a two hours now.
[9884.68s -> 9886.31s]  Or we're going to go somewhere instead.
[9886.31s -> 9886.87s]  I don't want to pay.
[9886.87s -> 9887.75s]  I don't want to do that right now.
[9887.75s -> 9890.95s]  I'm going to make a tuna sandwich in the fridge.
[9890.95s -> 9891.91s]  No, I'm all good.
[9891.91s -> 9892.31s]  I'm good.
[9892.31s -> 9892.55s]  I'm good.
[9892.55s -> 9893.59s]  I don't want food.
[9893.59s -> 9896.31s]  Oh, what was the last time you ate?
[9896.31s -> 9897.02s]  Fuck.
[9897.02s -> 9897.66s]  Okay.
[9897.66s -> 9899.78s]  You've been here for four hours, so you know.
[9899.78s -> 9901.54s]  It's been at least probably six hours.
[9901.54s -> 9902.60s]  I'm not hungry.
[9902.60s -> 9903.48s]  Not really.
[9903.48s -> 9907.77s]  That was a real wink.
[9907.77s -> 9912.49s]  All right.
[9912.49s -> 9917.13s]  Rug.
[9917.13s -> 9919.29s]  Bugaberry is a positive role model.
[9919.29s -> 9923.83s]  Tell me what you want to know.
[9923.83s -> 9926.20s]  I got a rug.
[9926.20s -> 9927.08s]  Scam wink.
[9927.08s -> 9928.02s]  All right.
[9928.02s -> 9929.78s]  Let me just get like 10 of them out of the way
[9929.78s -> 9931.06s]  because I'm going to get scammed.
[9931.06s -> 9939.50s]  Great news.
[9939.50s -> 9941.46s]  What is it?
[9941.46s -> 9945.58s]  I found you a rug.
[9945.58s -> 9946.54s]  What?
[9946.54s -> 9948.06s]  Holy guacaboli.
[9948.06s -> 9949.34s]  This is great news.
[9949.34s -> 9950.78s]  Thanks for tracking it down.
[9950.78s -> 9951.90s]  This should do the trick.
[9951.90s -> 9952.22s]  Wow.
[9952.22s -> 9953.50s]  It looks just like new.
[9953.50s -> 9955.56s]  Hopefully the band won't notice the mess.
[9955.56s -> 9964.17s]  You just tanked the wink market.
[9964.17s -> 9964.33s]  Yeah.
[9964.33s -> 9965.77s]  Now it's worth like one cent.
[9965.85s -> 9972.90s]  I don't think they will.
[9972.90s -> 9974.18s]  They're in a fish tank anyway.
[9976.28s -> 9976.60s]  Why?
[9977.85s -> 9978.49s]  One guess.
[9979.85s -> 9980.65s]  They're a fish.
[9982.17s -> 9982.65s]  Bingo.
[9984.17s -> 9984.49s]  Wait.
[9984.49s -> 9985.45s]  Do you mean to tell me
[9986.01s -> 9988.49s]  you got the most famous band of all time?
[9988.49s -> 9989.77s]  The Market Buddies?
[9990.58s -> 9990.90s]  Yep.
[9991.62s -> 9992.66s]  They're on their way.
[9992.66s -> 9992.98s]  Wow.
[9992.98s -> 9995.14s]  I saw them live once and it was blown away.
[9996.25s -> 9998.31s]  I just shorted it.
[9998.31s -> 9999.99s]  Oh, you just shorted?
[9999.99s -> 10002.04s]  Did you?
[10002.04s -> 10002.44s]  Oh, wow.
[10002.44s -> 10003.96s]  I'm really sorry to hear that.
[10003.96s -> 10004.36s]  Sorry.
[10004.36s -> 10006.92s]  Oh, you shorted the winks.
[10006.92s -> 10007.64s]  Wow.
[10007.64s -> 10013.30s]  Winks are now a million points.
[10013.30s -> 10014.02s]  Fucking idiot.
[10024.23s -> 10025.27s]  I can't wait.
[10025.27s -> 10029.43s]  I'm excited too.
[10029.43s -> 10031.35s]  I can't wait for the parade to begin.
[10031.35s -> 10033.18s]  I better get back to work.
[10033.18s -> 10033.98s]  Did I get any money?
[10033.98s -> 10035.40s]  Before you go,
[10035.40s -> 10036.68s]  I should give you something in return.
[10036.68s -> 10037.80s]  One dollar.
[10037.80s -> 10041.90s]  I have some building supplies left over
[10041.90s -> 10042.86s]  from when I made the stage.
[10042.86s -> 10044.06s]  Is that enough?
[10044.06s -> 10044.54s]  Yeah.
[10044.54s -> 10045.26s]  Thank you.
[10045.26s -> 10050.63s]  Real wink.
[10050.63s -> 10052.47s]  So this is if a real wink comes in,
[10052.47s -> 10057.02s]  I just stare and then people realize,
[10057.02s -> 10057.98s]  oh, no, no, no.
[10057.98s -> 10058.38s]  Oh my God.
[10058.38s -> 10058.70s]  Oh my God.
[10058.70s -> 10059.50s]  They're worthless.
[10059.50s -> 10059.98s]  Oh my God.
[10059.98s -> 10060.62s]  Now they're not.
[10060.62s -> 10064.55s]  Now I can't even get a wink for buying a wink.
[10065.51s -> 10066.47s]  Now I go.
[10066.47s -> 10068.01s]  This is when I go to court and shit.
[10068.01s -> 10069.05s]  I get sued.
[10069.05s -> 10070.81s]  And it's a fucking mess.
[10070.81s -> 10071.61s]  Get out now.
[10071.61s -> 10081.77s]  It was simply a favor.
[10081.77s -> 10084.28s]  Don't be silly.
[10084.28s -> 10085.88s]  You worked hard to get me this rug.
[10085.88s -> 10087.08s]  I insist.
[10087.08s -> 10087.72s]  Wow, thanks.
[10089.29s -> 10091.61s]  Got one money and building supplies.
[10099.38s -> 10101.30s]  These voices are making my teeth fall out.
[10103.42s -> 10106.06s]  I'm going to be really honest with you here.
[10106.06s -> 10107.66s]  I think that's just a coincidence of you
[10107.66s -> 10109.18s]  not going to the dentist for 10 years.
[10110.78s -> 10111.82s]  It happened now.
[10112.78s -> 10113.98s]  Like your teeth started.
[10113.98s -> 10114.94s]  It had nothing to do with me.
[10115.50s -> 10124.87s]  I hear the supplies.
[10128.94s -> 10130.22s]  The wink is a scam.
[10130.22s -> 10130.62s]  Dump it.
[10130.62s -> 10131.66s]  Dump all your points.
[10132.79s -> 10133.75s]  Dump all points.
[10133.75s -> 10135.27s]  Invest in highlights.
[10135.27s -> 10135.83s]  Oh, no.
[10136.47s -> 10137.99s]  You guys are just throwing it all away.
[10140.36s -> 10141.56s]  Hello, small frog.
[10142.28s -> 10144.12s]  I managed to track down some building supplies.
[10144.68s -> 10145.72s]  Oh, great.
[10145.72s -> 10147.16s]  What exciting news.
[10147.16s -> 10149.24s]  I'd love to use them if you're okay to hand them over.
[10150.49s -> 10152.01s]  You guys are really selling all your points.
[10154.92s -> 10157.00s]  We just like banged all these out in a row.
[10157.00s -> 10157.56s]  Holy shit.
[10157.56s -> 10159.00s]  That was one, two, three, four, five.
[10164.18s -> 10164.74s]  Excellent.
[10165.38s -> 10166.74s]  Thank you so much.
[10166.74s -> 10168.38s]  Of course, I must pay you for this.
[10169.10s -> 10170.06s]  Oh, there's no need.
[10170.06s -> 10170.46s]  Really?
[10171.58s -> 10172.70s]  I won't hear it.
[10172.70s -> 10173.58s]  Please take a money.
[10177.42s -> 10177.98s]  One money.
[10179.29s -> 10180.26s]  Thank you.
[10180.26s -> 10181.46s]  Also, I think you've earned yourself
[10181.46s -> 10183.06s]  the title of honorary pirate.
[10184.18s -> 10185.16s]  Wow.
[10185.16s -> 10185.56s]  Really?
[10186.12s -> 10186.36s]  Me?
[10187.00s -> 10187.56s]  A pirate?
[10188.36s -> 10189.96s]  Yes, you have the treasure collecting skills
[10189.96s -> 10191.32s]  of the finest pirate.
[10191.32s -> 10193.61s]  For this, I must award you a special prize.
[10194.25s -> 10195.29s]  Here, take this hook.
[10196.87s -> 10197.51s]  Got a hook.
[10198.86s -> 10199.98s]  The hook goes over here.
[10199.98s -> 10201.98s]  We did this all in a row in 10 seconds.
[10202.70s -> 10205.10s]  Why am I not reading highlighted messages?
[10205.10s -> 10206.22s]  Because there's a million of them.
[10209.02s -> 10210.94s]  Wait, when did I say that I read out loud
[10210.94s -> 10217.56s]  all highlighted messages?
[10217.56s -> 10218.04s]  I don't.
[10219.37s -> 10220.41s]  That's impossible.
[10223.80s -> 10225.16s]  Because you devalued the wing.
[10225.80s -> 10228.66s]  So you guys are just devaluing
[10228.66s -> 10230.18s]  the highlighted chat messages.
[10230.18s -> 10230.82s]  That's what you're doing.
[10233.43s -> 10235.67s]  The more you do that, the more devalued they become.
[10236.54s -> 10238.62s]  Dermot lied about reading highlights.
[10238.62s -> 10239.90s]  Hey, what?
[10239.90s -> 10242.63s]  Dermot, you just said, all right, I'm moving on.
[10242.63s -> 10243.51s]  Look at this chat.
[10243.51s -> 10247.54s]  What a fucking engaged chat, by the way.
[10247.54s -> 10248.10s]  Look at this.
[10252.33s -> 10257.26s]  This is the third worst chat experience.
[10257.26s -> 10258.14s]  What are you talking about?
[10258.14s -> 10260.94s]  I would put this as the first best chat experience of 2020.
[10264.20s -> 10265.80s]  Sorry, I didn't really know why I said that.
[10266.81s -> 10267.37s]  All good.
[10267.37s -> 10268.41s]  Enjoy the hook.
[10268.41s -> 10269.51s]  And move over here.
[10270.07s -> 10278.62s]  Dermot, this is inhuman.
[10279.18s -> 10281.19s]  I didn't do anything.
[10281.91s -> 10284.07s]  I did Bernie Sanders for three hours.
[10284.07s -> 10287.26s]  Look what I got.
[10287.98s -> 10291.82s]  Okay, here's a hook.
[10292.38s -> 10297.02s]  You're back.
[10299.88s -> 10300.84s]  I found you a hook.
[10301.56s -> 10302.68s]  Oh, my stars.
[10302.68s -> 10303.08s]  Thank you.
[10303.08s -> 10304.84s]  I can fix my sign right away.
[10304.84s -> 10305.32s]  That's okay.
[10305.96s -> 10309.10s]  It's welcome.
[10313.16s -> 10314.92s]  I would like to repay you for this hook.
[10314.92s -> 10315.48s]  Let me guess.
[10316.44s -> 10317.16s]  One coin.
[10317.72s -> 10318.52s]  I got it for free.
[10319.16s -> 10320.52s]  Nothing is free in this world.
[10321.08s -> 10321.72s]  Just kidding.
[10321.72s -> 10323.48s]  Our society is really progressive
[10323.48s -> 10324.84s]  and often things are actually free.
[10325.64s -> 10329.67s]  As a sign of my gratitude,
[10329.67s -> 10331.91s]  please feel free to use my house whenever you need.
[10332.55s -> 10333.67s]  I can just use your house?
[10335.27s -> 10337.35s]  It's fairly simple, but beautifully decorated at least.
[10339.96s -> 10341.32s]  I have a phone too.
[10341.32s -> 10341.64s]  Great.
[10341.64s -> 10342.76s]  I'll be sure to use that.
[10343.32s -> 10344.28s]  I now live here.
[10345.16s -> 10346.36s]  Thank you, Susan.
[10346.36s -> 10355.19s]  I've worked really hard.
[10357.66s -> 10358.94s]  When's community content night?
[10362.06s -> 10365.18s]  Give or take maybe like 12 minutes from right now
[10365.18s -> 10374.46s]  because I think we're at the end of the game.
[10374.46s -> 10375.34s]  Anything in here?
[10375.34s -> 10381.03s]  Should I use the phone?
[10381.03s -> 10382.54s]  Yeah, there'll be a pee break.
[10382.54s -> 10384.65s]  Who should I call?
[10384.65s -> 10392.62s]  Oh, I don't have any numbers.
[10392.62s -> 10392.94s]  Okay.
[10394.49s -> 10398.26s]  Well, how much money do I have?
[10398.26s -> 10400.74s]  I have five money, which is what...
[10400.74s -> 10401.30s]  Who wanted...
[10401.30s -> 10402.34s]  You wanted five money.
[10406.09s -> 10406.73s]  Five money?
[10409.67s -> 10410.07s]  Oh, boy.
[10410.07s -> 10410.95s]  I love questions.
[10412.07s -> 10412.87s]  Five money.
[10413.51s -> 10416.30s]  Hi, Mary.
[10416.94s -> 10417.66s]  Hey, Detective.
[10418.22s -> 10421.06s]  How's the extortion going?
[10421.62s -> 10423.75s]  I think I've got your five money.
[10424.84s -> 10425.72s]  Well, for real?
[10427.34s -> 10429.42s]  I didn't think the extortion would work so quickly.
[10430.14s -> 10431.61s]  That's excellent news.
[10432.25s -> 10434.33s]  I'm really good at being extorted.
[10434.89s -> 10436.33s]  I'll say.
[10438.01s -> 10440.25s]  Anyway, do you have the information for me?
[10442.17s -> 10442.65s]  Totally.
[10443.74s -> 10446.46s]  Last night, I saw the postman drop off a parcel.
[10447.10s -> 10449.83s]  It was around the time the parade got destroyed.
[10450.87s -> 10452.71s]  I couldn't see who he was giving it to,
[10453.43s -> 10455.19s]  but it was someone here in the town.
[10456.50s -> 10458.26s]  Barney is the postman's name.
[10458.90s -> 10460.42s]  He's a chill dude.
[10460.42s -> 10462.18s]  I don't think he'd mind if you called him.
[10462.74s -> 10463.91s]  Have his number.
[10465.08s -> 10465.72s]  May I have it?
[10466.73s -> 10467.37s]  Absolutely.
[10468.01s -> 10470.33s]  Got phone number.
[10470.33s -> 10474.62s]  Thanks for giving me this money.
[10475.26s -> 10476.94s]  I'm really excited to see Froggy Wood.
[10477.66s -> 10478.76s]  I'm excited too.
[10480.73s -> 10482.17s]  And then I have to wait until the parade's over.
[10482.17s -> 10482.73s]  Of course.
[10482.73s -> 10483.85s]  See you around, Detective.
[10484.73s -> 10486.09s]  Now we call Barney.
[10486.09s -> 10488.54s]  Who knows Cam?
[10488.54s -> 10564.46s]  Everybody always talk shit when we repeat a joke on the channel.
[10565.50s -> 10567.66s]  You guys are going to request knows Cam.
[10568.74s -> 10569.70s]  How dare you?
[10569.70s -> 10571.06s]  I'll actually fucking dare you.
[10577.58s -> 10578.22s]  Who should I call?
[10579.18s -> 10580.46s]  Call the mysterious number.
[10588.44s -> 10589.48s]  That's a small phone number.
[10594.30s -> 10595.02s]  He's driving.
[10600.82s -> 10602.42s]  Hi, it's Barney.
[10602.42s -> 10604.34s]  I have you on speaker.
[10604.34s -> 10605.94s]  Hi Barney.
[10606.58s -> 10606.90s]  Hi.
[10607.54s -> 10608.58s]  Who am I talking to?
[10610.78s -> 10611.50s]  Lobster cop.
[10612.30s -> 10613.10s]  Wow, really?
[10614.14s -> 10615.10s]  No, I was tricking you.
[10616.60s -> 10617.00s]  Rats.
[10617.64s -> 10619.85s]  Who is this noodle?
[10619.85s -> 10620.81s]  I'm the detective.
[10620.81s -> 10623.61s]  I'm calling about an incident that happened last night on Warlock Woods.
[10624.71s -> 10625.51s]  I didn't do it.
[10626.63s -> 10627.11s]  Do what?
[10627.91s -> 10631.30s]  Whatever you're calling about, it wasn't me.
[10631.30s -> 10634.92s]  Are you sure?
[10634.92s -> 10636.87s]  What did I do?
[10636.87s -> 10638.71s]  Last night someone destroyed a parade,
[10638.71s -> 10642.07s]  which was being set up for the new resident of the town, the invisible wizard.
[10642.07s -> 10646.04s]  I was told you were in the area when it happened.
[10646.04s -> 10648.02s]  Oh yeah, I was there.
[10648.02s -> 10650.18s]  Didn't destroy anything, if that's what you're asking.
[10650.82s -> 10652.58s]  Was just delivering a parcel.
[10652.58s -> 10654.94s]  Who were you delivering it to?
[10658.33s -> 10659.05s]  What was your name?
[10660.36s -> 10661.24s]  Lola.
[10661.24s -> 10665.56s]  I don't think there's anyone in town called Lola.
[10665.56s -> 10668.84s]  Must have been someone who lives there that the dress was drawn to parcel.
[10668.84s -> 10671.62s]  Oh, I can't remember exactly what house it was.
[10671.62s -> 10672.34s]  Sorry.
[10672.34s -> 10677.05s]  Do you remember where the parcel was sent from?
[10677.05s -> 10679.53s]  Oh yeah, I deliver a lot of parcels from them.
[10679.53s -> 10683.13s]  It was from the Wizbay.Bet headquarters.
[10683.13s -> 10686.73s]  That sounds really familiar, like the two of us on the phone right now.
[10686.73s -> 10689.37s]  You just are a little older sounding than me.
[10689.37s -> 10691.96s]  Where have I heard that name before?
[10691.96s -> 10695.82s]  I know Mandy's buys a lot of stuff from there, but this wasn't for her.
[10695.82s -> 10698.04s]  Do you know what was in the package?
[10698.04s -> 10699.54s]  Some sort of shoe, I think.
[10699.54s -> 10700.58s]  Maybe two shoes?
[10700.58s -> 10701.54s]  Her shoes?
[10701.54s -> 10703.80s]  Did you get a good look at them?
[10704.68s -> 10706.50s]  It was pretty dark.
[10706.50s -> 10710.73s]  I have no recollection of really seeing anyone.
[10710.73s -> 10712.65s]  Not even if this guy's a terrible mailman.
[10712.65s -> 10716.01s]  Yeah, 6666 viewers right now.
[10716.01s -> 10719.54s]  Fucking parade.
[10719.54s -> 10721.46s]  Oh weird, Warlock Woods is pretty dark,
[10721.46s -> 10723.70s]  but I haven't had much trouble seeing anyone before.
[10723.70s -> 10726.70s]  Me neither.
[10726.70s -> 10728.62s]  It wasn't much more dark than normal either.
[10728.62s -> 10730.78s]  All I remember is a blue dress with stars on it.
[10730.78s -> 10733.48s]  I'm pretty stumped on this case, Barney.
[10733.48s -> 10735.16s]  Do you know if there were any clues left behind?
[10735.16s -> 10738.01s]  A signature on the delivery slip or something?
[10738.01s -> 10739.53s]  I didn't get them to sign it,
[10739.53s -> 10742.71s]  but I remember someone dropping over at the entrance to the woods.
[10742.71s -> 10746.55s]  I tried to call it, tell them, but they'd stumble off before I noticed.
[10746.55s -> 10748.97s]  At the entrance to the woods, you say?
[10748.97s -> 10749.69s]  I'll check it out.
[10752.09s -> 10752.73s]  What did we just have?
[10752.73s -> 10753.85s]  Fucking community subs?
[10753.85s -> 10758.07s]  How many subs just came in?
[10758.07s -> 10764.74s]  One, two, three, four, five, six community subs from Great Canadian FK Club.
[10764.74s -> 10768.38s]  Thank you.
[10768.38s -> 10769.34s]  Thanks, Great Canadian.
[10769.34s -> 10769.98s]  Appreciate it.
[10769.98s -> 10775.11s]  Accidentally crashed his van into the decorations to roll away without realizing.
[10775.11s -> 10778.31s]  All right, well, we have a new motive.
[10778.31s -> 10786.14s]  So now we have to go look for this package, wherever that is.
[10786.14s -> 10788.07s]  I don't know.
[10788.07s -> 10790.55s]  What about, didn't they say it was in the beginning of the town?
[10790.55s -> 10795.78s]  Did I not leave?
[10795.78s -> 10798.02s]  I mean, I know it's that person's username, right?
[10798.02s -> 10799.86s]  The eBay, whatever it was.
[10799.86s -> 10801.50s]  I missed it?
[10801.50s -> 10807.75s]  This must be the thing Barney was talking about.
[10807.75s -> 10814.52s]  Hmm, they're glasses.
[10814.52s -> 10816.62s]  Oh, they have a name engraved on them.
[10816.62s -> 10817.74s]  The Invisible Wizard.
[10817.74s -> 10818.94s]  Well, this is my only clue left.
[10818.94s -> 10820.62s]  I think I should try and return these to the wizard.
[10820.70s -> 10827.69s]  You should be in the old house near Carlos's shop.
[10827.69s -> 10828.81s]  Use your fucking eyes.
[10830.50s -> 10832.18s]  Use your glasses, Jeremy.
[10832.18s -> 10836.10s]  Don't anger me.
[10836.66s -> 10839.67s]  All right, where's the wizard's house?
[10839.67s -> 10840.87s]  Right here.
[10840.87s -> 10847.90s]  Hello, is anyone home?
[10847.90s -> 10865.35s]  I found these glasses.
[10865.35s -> 10875.08s]  All right, it's an invisible wizard, but not really.
[10875.08s -> 10902.15s]  I'll just find you again.
[10903.19s -> 10904.07s]  Was that real?
[10904.07s -> 10904.87s]  I don't know, man.
[10904.87s -> 10906.79s]  This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[10907.67s -> 10910.65s]  This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[10910.65s -> 10923.35s]  Oh, this is seriously fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[10923.99s -> 10939.32s]  It's fucking crazy.
[10939.32s -> 10940.68s]  This is scaring the shit out of me.
[10942.06s -> 10943.02s]  Door opened?
[10943.02s -> 10943.90s]  Fuck, okay.
[10945.26s -> 10960.65s]  Fuck, Jesus.
[10960.65s -> 10962.57s]  This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[10969.75s -> 10971.19s]  Ah, who was there?
[10971.83s -> 10973.77s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[10973.77s -> 10975.13s]  I didn't mean to startle you.
[10976.31s -> 10977.19s]  I'm the detective.
[10981.75s -> 10982.87s]  Oh, thank goodness.
[10983.82s -> 10985.42s]  You're here to solve the mystery.
[10986.70s -> 10987.20s]  Yes.
[10989.00s -> 10989.50s]  Okay.
[10990.20s -> 10992.52s]  Well, I don't know where my glasses are.
[10993.40s -> 10995.56s]  So solve that as soon as possible, please.
[10996.28s -> 10997.16s]  Thanks in advance.
[10997.72s -> 11001.10s]  I found your glasses, I think.
[11002.41s -> 11003.13s]  Are these yours?
[11003.77s -> 11006.57s]  Oh, I can see again.
[11006.57s -> 11007.45s]  That was so quick.
[11008.01s -> 11009.13s]  You should get a promotion.
[11009.77s -> 11012.41s]  I don't remember calling a detective to solve this mystery,
[11012.41s -> 11013.69s]  but I must have done so.
[11014.70s -> 11017.10s]  Otherwise, why would you be here right now?
[11024.25s -> 11024.75s]  Yeah.
[11026.23s -> 11028.25s]  Well, no.
[11029.38s -> 11031.14s]  I'm actually here to solve a different mystery.
[11031.86s -> 11035.74s]  Which one?
[11036.30s -> 11038.36s]  I don't mean to ruin surprise,
[11038.36s -> 11040.20s]  but the town was setting up a parade for you.
[11042.10s -> 11044.10s]  I'm sorry to tell you last night.
[11044.66s -> 11046.50s]  I'm sorry to tell you that last night,
[11046.50s -> 11047.54s]  someone destroyed it.
[11050.01s -> 11051.69s]  Wait, you're the wizard doing the wrong voice?
[11053.70s -> 11054.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[11054.18s -> 11054.50s]  You're right.
[11054.50s -> 11055.00s]  Sorry.
[11057.61s -> 11060.89s]  However, I've noticed that your house is littered with the decorations.
[11060.89s -> 11066.94s]  Where were you last night?
[11066.94s -> 11071.90s]  I was out in Whismay.
[11071.90s -> 11073.34s]  I got some new shoes.
[11074.14s -> 11075.90s]  I picked express delivery.
[11075.90s -> 11077.18s]  They arrived last night.
[11079.19s -> 11080.23s]  Oh, you're Lola.
[11081.29s -> 11081.79s]  Yes.
[11082.68s -> 11083.88s]  Back to my alibi.
[11084.44s -> 11088.50s]  I went to pick up my shoes from the delivery guy.
[11089.80s -> 11091.64s]  And then I dropped my glasses.
[11091.64s -> 11104.36s]  Needs echo.
[11104.36s -> 11104.92s]  Oh.
[11104.92s -> 11108.90s]  And that's all I have to say about that.
[11108.90s -> 11111.27s]  Are you sure?
[11112.62s -> 11113.34s]  Yes.
[11113.34s -> 11115.58s]  I think someone else must have destroyed the parade.
[11116.14s -> 11118.31s]  Perhaps one of my enemies.
[11122.18s -> 11123.14s]  You have enemies?
[11124.79s -> 11125.91s]  Um, yeah.
[11126.47s -> 11130.42s]  Who?
[11130.42s -> 11131.30s]  The guy.
[11133.62s -> 11134.58s]  People think it's Bugleberry.
[11134.58s -> 11135.38s]  You're losing viewers.
[11141.08s -> 11141.80s]  Evil guy.
[11143.32s -> 11144.36s]  Sorry, what?
[11144.36s -> 11144.86s]  Enemy.
[11146.04s -> 11149.48s]  An enemy, evil, a giant, evil enemy.
[11149.48s -> 11149.98s]  Enemy.
[11150.84s -> 11151.93s]  Evil guy?
[11153.38s -> 11153.88s]  Yeah.
[11154.42s -> 11155.82s]  Are you making this up?
[11157.18s -> 11157.68s]  No.
[11158.22s -> 11160.62s]  Evil dude really is my giant enemy.
[11161.26s -> 11162.87s]  Don't you mean evil guy?
[11164.87s -> 11165.99s]  Evil guy.
[11165.99s -> 11169.35s]  He's posting, he's posting cringe.
[11173.03s -> 11173.53s]  Shut up.
[11174.23s -> 11174.87s]  Shut up.
[11175.67s -> 11176.31s]  Quiet.
[11176.31s -> 11177.27s]  Quiet that person.
[11177.99s -> 11178.95s]  Your enemy?
[11178.95s -> 11179.45s]  Yes.
[11182.42s -> 11184.26s]  Where can I contact evil guy?
[11185.16s -> 11187.08s]  Oh, he's not able to be contacted.
[11187.08s -> 11189.88s]  He's very mysterious and he's not available right now.
[11196.38s -> 11197.34s]  Or ever even.
[11197.34s -> 11199.34s]  Anyway, he must have destroyed the parade.
[11200.78s -> 11201.42s]  Case solved.
[11201.42s -> 11202.22s]  We did it.
[11202.22s -> 11203.10s]  Well done.
[11203.10s -> 11203.82s]  Well done.
[11203.82s -> 11204.30s]  Wow.
[11204.30s -> 11206.38s]  Too bad he's not able to be apprehended.
[11206.38s -> 11208.30s]  But at least we can continue with our lives.
[11208.94s -> 11213.00s]  Lola, are you being dishonest?
[11216.58s -> 11217.08s]  Yes.
[11218.95s -> 11221.27s]  I'm really sorry.
[11221.27s -> 11222.31s]  It was me.
[11222.31s -> 11223.83s]  It was an accident.
[11223.83s -> 11224.71s]  I swear it.
[11225.67s -> 11227.03s]  You destroyed the parade, didn't you?
[11233.13s -> 11234.65s]  You posted cringe, bro.
[11239.03s -> 11240.55s]  I didn't know the parade was for me.
[11240.55s -> 11241.27s]  That's so nice.
[11241.91s -> 11242.87s]  And I've ruined it.
[11243.51s -> 11245.94s]  When I dropped my glasses, I couldn't find my way home.
[11245.94s -> 11246.98s]  I was bumping into everything.
[11246.98s -> 11247.62s]  It was horrible.
[11251.62s -> 11253.86s]  Don't, please don't post cringe again.
[11258.12s -> 11259.24s]  What happened when you got home?
[11260.12s -> 11262.97s]  I had some chips stuck to me so I ate those.
[11262.97s -> 11263.77s]  And then I just hid.
[11264.49s -> 11267.90s]  Why didn't you tell anyone what happened?
[11268.38s -> 11270.97s]  I'm so embarrassed about it.
[11270.97s -> 11274.39s]  I only just moved in and already I've made a big mistake.
[11275.11s -> 11279.93s]  Can you guys even fucking hear that?
[11279.93s -> 11293.34s]  Why is that not working?
[11294.22s -> 11298.14s]  This has been, this has not been working the whole time.
[11299.18s -> 11300.82s]  No way.
[11300.82s -> 11307.22s]  I recorded it.
[11307.94s -> 11309.82s]  Dabba dabba doo.
[11310.54s -> 11313.16s]  Why are you not hearing this?
[11313.16s -> 11314.12s]  I'm so fucking mad.
[11315.00s -> 11317.96s]  I played this like, I've been playing this sentence
[11317.96s -> 11320.20s]  for the last like 15 straight minutes, like every few minutes.
[11321.08s -> 11322.28s]  Because I sampled it.
[11322.28s -> 11323.56s]  But why, I don't know why it's not working.
[11329.59s -> 11330.87s]  That, that's annoying.
[11331.67s -> 11332.23s]  That's annoying.
[11334.50s -> 11335.62s]  What the fuck happened?
[11335.62s -> 11336.74s]  Oh, wait, what?
[11339.13s -> 11340.17s]  Oh, that's annoying.
[11340.17s -> 11340.73s]  Whatever.
[11340.73s -> 11341.61s]  Oh, that sucks.
[11342.73s -> 11346.23s]  I thought I had it set up correctly.
[11346.23s -> 11347.75s]  What a pain in the ass, whatever.
[11347.75s -> 11349.03s]  Fucking joke sucked, ruined.
[11349.99s -> 11354.12s]  I sampled myself saying something
[11354.12s -> 11355.64s]  and I was, I thought you guys could hear it
[11355.64s -> 11356.92s]  and I was just not paying attention to it.
[11356.92s -> 11358.12s]  It was fucking hilarious.
[11358.68s -> 11360.36s]  I'm a very shy lady detective.
[11360.36s -> 11362.76s]  I make myself invisible so no one can see me.
[11362.76s -> 11364.36s]  That must have been why nobody saw you.
[11365.32s -> 11366.12s]  Yes, I suppose.
[11366.68s -> 11368.76s]  Did it become non-invisible, un-invisible visible?
[11370.65s -> 11371.29s]  You insist.
[11372.01s -> 11375.37s]  Ta-da.
[11375.99s -> 11379.93s]  You're a frog like me.
[11380.97s -> 11381.47s]  Yes.
[11382.09s -> 11383.53s]  I'm slightly disappointed.
[11384.09s -> 11384.59s]  What?
[11385.22s -> 11387.14s]  Well, it's just that I had a good joke prepared.
[11387.78s -> 11388.89s]  I know how it feels.
[11389.61s -> 11391.58s]  We're the same person, you and I.
[11391.58s -> 11393.10s]  Exact same fucking person.
[11393.10s -> 11394.46s]  I'll do it anyways.
[11394.46s -> 11396.41s]  Okay, so imagine that instead of a frog,
[11396.41s -> 11397.77s]  you were revealed to be a lizard.
[11398.63s -> 11399.19s]  Oh, no.
[11400.15s -> 11401.59s]  Okay, so you've just been revealed.
[11401.59s -> 11402.31s]  Okay, pretend.
[11403.19s -> 11403.83s]  Okay.
[11403.91s -> 11404.87s]  It's me, a lizard.
[11405.43s -> 11407.99s]  Wow, so you're not an invisible wizard after all.
[11409.40s -> 11410.60s]  You're an invisible lizard.
[11411.24s -> 11412.36s]  That was way worse than mine.
[11413.51s -> 11415.03s]  I don't even say that that was on the same level
[11415.03s -> 11416.23s]  as the joke I was going to make.
[11422.28s -> 11425.40s]  Don't do minus twos for something I didn't say.
[11426.28s -> 11428.36s]  You know what?
[11429.46s -> 11429.94s]  You know what?
[11429.94s -> 11430.98s]  Fuck you guys, I'm out of here.
[11448.15s -> 11449.35s]  Yeah, it was a good joke.
[11449.35s -> 11450.23s]  I thought, me too.
[11450.79s -> 11452.44s]  Detective, are you going to tell everyone?
[11455.82s -> 11463.58s]  Was that even a joke you were going to make?
[11463.58s -> 11464.22s]  No, no.
[11465.66s -> 11466.62s]  Why is it not playing?
[11466.62s -> 11468.86s]  It lights up and I can see it playing.
[11468.86s -> 11475.35s]  It's just not being broadcast through to you guys
[11475.35s -> 11476.39s]  for some crazy reason.
[11477.03s -> 11479.27s]  More, if you tell everyone what I did,
[11479.27s -> 11479.99s]  they will be upset.
[11480.55s -> 11483.18s]  I think they'd forgive you right away.
[11484.30s -> 11487.08s]  What if they don't?
[11487.08s -> 11488.60s]  I want to make a good first impression.
[11489.24s -> 11490.57s]  When we go outside,
[11490.57s -> 11492.89s]  can you please tell them that it was evil guy?
[11493.53s -> 11494.25s]  That's a lie.
[11494.81s -> 11496.09s]  A white lie, perhaps.
[11496.09s -> 11497.69s]  But who is it harming really?
[11497.69s -> 11498.49s]  Evil guy.
[11498.49s -> 11499.85s]  Evil guy isn't real.
[11499.85s -> 11501.61s]  This is a moral dilemma, Lola.
[11501.61s -> 11503.53s]  Just like in my favorite episode of Parriot.
[11504.17s -> 11504.90s]  Parriot.
[11505.46s -> 11506.41s]  Parrois?
[11506.41s -> 11506.97s]  Parrois?
[11507.53s -> 11508.09s]  Parrois?
[11509.03s -> 11510.23s]  It's your choice, detective.
[11510.23s -> 11511.11s]  Let's face the music.
[11511.75s -> 11520.76s]  Or the routing settings in your GoXLR.
[11520.76s -> 11521.88s]  Yeah, I thought I had it set correctly.
[11521.88s -> 11522.68s]  I guess not.
[11522.68s -> 11529.54s]  Frog Detective 2, complete.
[11530.42s -> 11538.01s]  Now we're moving on to Community Content Night.
[11538.01s -> 11539.61s]  Episode 2, week 2.
[11540.65s -> 11547.38s]  Hello.
[11548.97s -> 11549.61s]  Hi.
[11549.61s -> 11551.82s]  My name is Lola.
[11551.82s -> 11552.78s]  Hi, Lola.
[11552.78s -> 11555.26s]  I'm a frog, just like me.
[11555.82s -> 11557.58s]  We're so glad you could make it, Lola.
[11557.66s -> 11559.34s]  You guys are standing way too close together.
[11559.90s -> 11561.96s]  Sorry that there's been so much commotion
[11561.96s -> 11563.80s]  trying to get the parade ready for you.
[11563.80s -> 11565.24s]  Somebody destroyed it last night.
[11565.80s -> 11566.84s]  Barry, don't tell her that.
[11567.56s -> 11569.32s]  We're sorry that somebody destroyed it, Lola.
[11569.32s -> 11571.24s]  The detective has been trying to figure out who did it.
[11572.98s -> 11574.98s]  Well, detective, have you solved the mystery?
[11574.98s -> 11575.86s]  Hope it wasn't me.
[11576.42s -> 11578.94s]  I'd be surprised if it was any of us.
[11578.94s -> 11580.30s]  I wouldn't, looking at you, Ralph.
[11581.51s -> 11582.01s]  What?
[11582.47s -> 11583.83s]  Ralph didn't do it, Victor.
[11583.83s -> 11585.59s]  How many times do we have to tell you?
[11585.59s -> 11587.11s]  I just don't trust that guy.
[11587.11s -> 11587.61s]  Rude.
[11588.23s -> 11589.51s]  I'm not rude anymore, Ralph.
[11589.51s -> 11590.15s]  I had food.
[11590.79s -> 11592.23s]  I don't think that's how food works.
[11592.95s -> 11593.75s]  I didn't do it.
[11593.75s -> 11595.67s]  Well, I guess we'll find out in a moment.
[11595.67s -> 11601.35s]  Go ahead, detective.
[11601.35s -> 11605.30s]  She did it.
[11605.30s -> 11610.97s]  Who was it?
[11610.97s -> 11613.45s]  It was, it was Lola.
[11613.45s -> 11614.25s]  What?
[11614.25s -> 11616.02s]  It was an accident.
[11616.02s -> 11617.54s]  Lola dropped her glasses last night
[11617.54s -> 11619.78s]  while picking up some shoes she bought on Whizbay.
[11619.78s -> 11622.65s]  Oh my gosh, those are the ones I really wanted.
[11623.29s -> 11624.25s]  They look amazing.
[11625.05s -> 11626.33s]  Lola can't see without her glasses,
[11626.33s -> 11628.09s]  so she had a lot of trouble getting home last night.
[11628.09s -> 11629.13s]  I'm doing the thing that you,
[11629.13s -> 11631.13s]  I'm doing the mother, the parents,
[11631.13s -> 11633.61s]  reading the story in bed when you were a kid.
[11634.33s -> 11635.69s]  And they're getting, they're losing interest,
[11635.69s -> 11636.49s]  and they're falling asleep,
[11636.49s -> 11637.53s]  and then they start to do,
[11637.53s -> 11639.30s]  we talked about this before.
[11639.30s -> 11641.06s]  She bumped into just about everything.
[11641.06s -> 11645.69s]  I'm so sorry, I feel awful.
[11645.69s -> 11647.06s]  I realized what happened
[11647.06s -> 11648.74s]  when I had lots of chips stuck to me.
[11648.74s -> 11652.28s]  Do the Earth Explodes joke.
[11652.28s -> 11652.76s]  What?
[11652.76s -> 11653.88s]  I ate them, they were delicious.
[11653.88s -> 11655.00s]  The parade was for me all along,
[11655.00s -> 11656.04s]  and I didn't realize it.
[11656.04s -> 11657.88s]  Lola was very scared of your reactions,
[11657.88s -> 11659.56s]  so she hid in her house out of shame.
[11659.56s -> 11662.07s]  Oh, Lola, it's okay.
[11662.07s -> 11662.95s]  You should have told us.
[11662.95s -> 11664.68s]  We completely understand.
[11664.68s -> 11666.76s]  Yeah, Mary destroys stuff all the time.
[11666.76s -> 11667.96s]  Yeah, I really do.
[11667.96s -> 11670.60s]  Plus, Naughty tried to vacuum you up,
[11670.60s -> 11672.12s]  so I feel like the parade being destroyed
[11672.12s -> 11673.08s]  is kind of fine.
[11673.08s -> 11675.43s]  I thought she was a ghost.
[11675.43s -> 11677.35s]  That's what they all say.
[11677.35s -> 11678.62s]  Hee hee.
[11678.62s -> 11680.30s]  We're all really excited you're here, Lola.
[11680.30s -> 11681.98s]  We don't need decorations anyway.
[11681.98s -> 11684.57s]  I really thought Ralph did it.
[11684.57s -> 11685.21s]  Victor.
[11685.21s -> 11691.51s]  Victor apologized right now to Ralph.
[11691.51s -> 11695.40s]  Ralph, sorry I said ayaya.
[11695.40s -> 11696.52s]  It's not okay.
[11696.52s -> 11698.57s]  This is a real conversation
[11698.57s -> 11701.98s]  that I have with my chat once a week.
[11701.98s -> 11703.26s]  I am also sorry.
[11703.26s -> 11704.78s]  I really didn't mean to destroy the parade,
[11704.78s -> 11706.38s]  but I should have spoken up when I did.
[11706.38s -> 11708.47s]  I'm a very nervous lady.
[11708.47s -> 11710.39s]  Plus, what a terrible first impression.
[11710.90s -> 11713.27s]  Not as bad as my first impression.
[11713.27s -> 11714.31s]  What did you do?
[11714.31s -> 11716.70s]  I ran over Mary by accident.
[11716.70s -> 11717.90s]  Ha ha, yeah.
[11717.90s -> 11719.69s]  That was really painful.
[11719.69s -> 11720.25s]  Ha ha.
[11720.25s -> 11722.41s]  Should we get this party started?
[11722.41s -> 11723.05s]  Another party.
[11723.05s -> 11723.69s]  Let's go.
[11723.69s -> 11744.41s]  Are we going to pick another dancer?
[11744.41s -> 11745.69s]  Okay, why does this feel like something
[11745.69s -> 11749.34s]  that I would see on British television?
[11749.34s -> 11750.86s]  What's happening right now?
[11750.86s -> 11764.84s]  The song, too.
[11764.84s -> 11765.32s]  The music.
[11766.30s -> 11767.34s]  What everybody's doing.
[11767.34s -> 11768.78s]  The way that everybody is and looks.
[11768.78s -> 11774.54s]  And special thanks to the super hot team.
[11776.14s -> 11776.86s]  Hash house.
[11776.86s -> 11777.42s]  Hash house.
[11777.42s -> 11777.90s]  House house.
[11778.94s -> 11779.44s]  Geeks.
[11782.01s -> 11782.51s]  Chad.
[11783.40s -> 11783.90s]  Ben.
[11787.19s -> 11787.69s]  Papa.
[11788.15s -> 11790.25s]  Naughty the dog.
[11799.53s -> 11800.03s]  Ben.
[11800.25s -> 11800.75s]  Ben.
[11801.13s -> 11801.63s]  Ben.
[11802.87s -> 11803.59s]  Papa Ben.
[11804.25s -> 11804.75s]  Ben.
[11804.97s -> 11805.47s]  Ben.
[11806.01s -> 11806.51s]  Ben.
[11806.89s -> 11808.98s]  I'll get it right.
[11808.98s -> 11822.07s]  I just got an achievement.
[11822.07s -> 11823.27s]  It's called Snitch.
[11842.87s -> 11843.91s]  I live in my house.
[11844.87s -> 11847.53s]  I live in my house.
[11848.25s -> 11850.18s]  Okay, where?
[11850.18s -> 11850.68s]  Right here.
[11851.46s -> 11856.34s]  Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.
[11856.34s -> 11856.98s]  Frog Detective speaking.
[11856.98s -> 11857.62s]  How can I help you?
[11858.66s -> 11859.94s]  Detective.
[11859.94s -> 11861.06s]  Supervisor.
[11861.06s -> 11862.10s]  It's me, the supervisor.
[11862.10s -> 11863.06s]  I am aware.
[11863.06s -> 11864.98s]  Great job on solving the invisible wizard mystery.
[11864.98s -> 11866.18s]  That was quite a head-scratcher.
[11866.90s -> 11867.40s]  Sure was.
[11868.02s -> 11871.82s]  I was shocked that the culprit was the wizard herself.
[11872.62s -> 11874.94s]  Yeah, the mysteries I solve are never what they seem.
[11875.50s -> 11877.58s]  It's always a misunderstanding or an accident.
[11877.58s -> 11880.06s]  No one is ever malicious on purpose in my mysteries.
[11880.94s -> 11883.18s]  I'm so glad that crime isn't real.
[11886.14s -> 11887.74s]  Didn't you get extorted earlier?
[11889.29s -> 11891.13s]  Yes, I think that's a crime.
[11891.77s -> 11894.47s]  I suppose that crime is real after all.
[11895.03s -> 11898.87s]  Your office is called Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.
[11898.87s -> 11899.37s]  Yes.
[11899.83s -> 11902.07s]  Detective, why do you believe that crime isn't real?
[11902.95s -> 11906.26s]  Community Night sucks.
[11906.26s -> 11907.70s]  Frog Detective forever.
[11907.70s -> 11908.10s]  You just did...
[11908.10s -> 11908.74s]  We did it all.
[11908.74s -> 11910.58s]  We did every Frog Detective that exists.
[11911.22s -> 11912.70s]  But there's no more to do.
[11912.70s -> 11913.82s]  There's no more to do.
[11914.46s -> 11915.98s]  I was exaggerating.
[11915.98s -> 11917.58s]  Plus, despite my job title,
[11917.58s -> 11919.66s]  I never really seemed to be solving crimes.
[11919.66s -> 11924.50s]  That's going to change in a moment, I think, Detective.
[11924.50s -> 11926.09s]  Oh, super duper.
[11926.09s -> 11928.36s]  Just got a call about a doozy of a case.
[11929.24s -> 11930.20s]  That sounds exciting.
[11930.76s -> 11933.96s]  It is, but it's also the most challenging case I've ever sent you on.
[11934.60s -> 11937.14s]  I'm confident in your abilities,
[11937.78s -> 11939.54s]  but you might need backup on this one.
[11940.60s -> 11941.10s]  Like who?
[11941.80s -> 11944.20s]  I'm going to send the lobster cop to help you with the case.
[11946.44s -> 11949.24s]  Really? Lobster cop handles such advanced cases.
[11949.24s -> 11950.36s]  Won't I just slow him down?
[11951.40s -> 11952.36s]  Nonsense, Detective.
[11952.36s -> 11955.16s]  You've shown you're a very capable mystery solver.
[11955.16s -> 11957.24s]  I think you're in the running to be the new number one.
[11958.12s -> 11959.00s]  You're making me blush.
[11959.80s -> 11960.68s]  You'll be a-okay.
[11961.32s -> 11962.81s]  So where am I heading next?
[11963.45s -> 11965.13s]  I can't say over the phone. It's too sensitive.
[11966.33s -> 11968.52s]  Wow. Head to the train station.
[11968.52s -> 11970.12s]  I've left a ticket for you there.
[11970.12s -> 11973.00s]  The train will take you to where you need to be.
[11973.90s -> 11975.18s]  Good luck. I want to meet this character.
[11977.19s -> 11977.99s]  Good luck, Detective.
[11977.99s -> 11979.11s]  Do you think you can handle it?
[11979.11s -> 11980.55s]  I can handle anything.
[11980.55s -> 11986.04s]  All right.
[11986.04s -> 11992.36s]  Frog Detective will return in episode three after the detective has left.
[11993.32s -> 12012.17s]  Is somebody breaking in the room and stealing something?
[12012.81s -> 12034.99s]  All right.
[12040.47s -> 12041.59s]  He looks like he's made of ice cream.
[12041.59s -> 12042.71s]  He looks like he's made of ice cream.
[12043.67s -> 12051.30s]  I would love to eat Frog Detective in an ice cream bar.
[12052.66s -> 12062.82s]  He's definitely lemon lime.
[12063.86s -> 12069.37s]  You know those shark bars, the shark popsicles?
[12070.01s -> 12072.09s]  I feel like he's a creamier version of that flavor.
[12072.81s -> 12083.96s]  Isn't that a character on Sesame Street?
[12084.68s -> 12097.61s]  The detective will return in
[12099.05s -> 12104.20s]  Cowboy County.
[12104.76s -> 12106.44s]  Corruption at Cowboy County.
[12112.18s -> 12113.94s]  What happened to community content night?
[12116.28s -> 12118.04s]  I deleted everything accidentally.
[12118.84s -> 12120.86s]  I just like there was a ton of it.
[12120.86s -> 12121.66s]  I just fucking hit.
[12121.66s -> 12124.22s]  I pressed the backspace button on it with everything selected.
[12124.86s -> 12125.74s]  Sorry.
