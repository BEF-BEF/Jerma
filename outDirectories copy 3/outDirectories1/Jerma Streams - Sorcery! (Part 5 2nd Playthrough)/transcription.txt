[2.04s -> 13.03s]  Hello. Yeah, sorry. Sorry I'm late. I got carried away with something. I got a little carried away.
[14.10s -> 19.19s]  I don't know why my voice sounds like this. You know, it's weird. This is the first time I've
[19.19s -> 26.70s]  talked all day. I've not opened my mouth to speak a single word till right now. And it sounds like
[27.34s -> 33.77s]  morning voice. Yeah. Wait, is morning voice something that you have to kind of work out of?
[39.35s -> 48.14s]  If you wake up and you don't talk at all, you don't say a single word, will morning voice
[48.14s -> 57.75s]  continue to follow you until you open your mouth and speak? Really? I've never thought about it
[57.75s -> 69.83s]  that deeply. I have not said a single word. How come you're asking me that? I don't know. Maybe
[69.83s -> 75.64s]  some of you guys are doctors or scientists. I know a lot of you are. It's because you smoke.
[75.72s -> 86.84s]  That's why your voice is like that. I know I don't. Anyways, hi. Bro, your voice is so deep.
[93.26s -> 97.61s]  I don't know why it sounds like this today. I feel fine. It's not like, oh,
[97.61s -> 101.13s]  guys, my throat's bothering me. No, I feel completely fine. I just haven't spoken in
[101.13s -> 108.78s]  like 12 hours. Quick, do some impressions. Who could I do an impression of with a voice like this?
[109.83s -> 123.03s]  How about, I don't know. Who do you think? Who could I do? Patrick? Hey, SpongeBob. It's me,
[123.03s -> 130.87s]  Patrick. Oh, yeah, SpongeBob. Let's go have an adventure. Does that sound like him, kind of?
[135.35s -> 144.09s]  That wasn't even close. Oh, yes, it was. What are you talking about? SpongeBob, it's me, Patrick.
[151.08s -> 161.34s]  Bernie Sanders. Hold on a second. Hold on. Patrick. Patrick Starr. That sounds like Patrick.
[167.62s -> 177.37s]  Top LOL moments from Patrick Starr. Hold on. I need to hear. Hold on. Okay.
[187.03s -> 189.10s]  Hold on.
[198.94s -> 211.11s]  This ought to do the trick. That does the same sound. Hold on. What about this one?
[217.34s -> 220.44s]  I sense no danger here. How could it be dangerous?
[227.78s -> 237.00s]  Sometimes it's too easy. I'll just be honest. All right, let's go. Let me start the stream. Let me
[237.00s -> 246.07s]  say hello first. Did I even tweet? I didn't even tweet. Dude, you're starting 40 minutes late.
[246.55s -> 253.26s]  There's a reason why I'm late. Okay, do you understand? I've been sitting here.
[253.82s -> 260.90s]  So in pre-stream chat, we were just talking. Is that like 12, I don't know, 12, 15, 12 o'clock?
[261.70s -> 269.83s]  And I was doing something at the desk here, just typing away. And I got really, really
[269.83s -> 274.73s]  tired of typing away. And I got really carried away. And I looked over and it was, the only reason
[274.73s -> 280.25s]  why I noticed is because the chat got really fast. Because it was just over on my other monitor,
[280.25s -> 285.46s]  just kind of in the corner. And in my peripheral, I just see bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing,
[285.46s -> 287.30s]  bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. And I was like,
[287.30s -> 296.38s]  what's going on? Oh, that's right. That's right. I got to start. I got carried away doing something.
[296.38s -> 302.73s]  And yes, I will show you that thing potentially. And so if you're good. But today we're going to
[302.73s -> 307.05s]  play Sorcery. We're going to go back to it. I know a lot of people have been waiting for Sorcery.
[307.05s -> 314.78s]  I know a lot of you've been waiting to, let me turn the crickets off. There. I know it's been
[314.78s -> 320.92s]  kind of on the back burner for a few weeks, but it's back. We're going to chill. We'll play it
[320.92s -> 325.93s]  for a little while. I'm going to give a quick recap. We'll kind of just get our bearings and
[325.93s -> 341.11s]  see where we are in the game. How come you look like a cartoon? I don't, I don't know, dude,
[341.11s -> 347.35s]  because half the time you've ever seen me has been on a web. Okay. It's time for me to tell
[347.35s -> 354.95s]  you something. Your only barometer for the way that I look has been in professional studio lighting
[355.51s -> 362.62s]  and shitty webcam. I don't know what to tell you. It's a, there's a lot of, there's a large range
[362.62s -> 379.83s]  here. Barometer. What? How many pushups could you do live in a way? How many pushups could you do
[379.83s -> 386.92s]  in a life and death situation? Nowadays, probably not very many because of the chest pain that I
[386.92s -> 392.04s]  have. Probably not very many. I could probably realistically just go, I'd probably do at least
[392.04s -> 397.72s]  20. Five to 10 years ago, if you would ask that question, it would probably have been at least
[397.72s -> 409.50s]  60 to a hundred. At least. Barometer is air pressure, dude. What are you talking about?
[410.06s -> 416.94s]  You can say barometer to, barometer is a gauge, right? It's an instrument to gauge a certain
[416.94s -> 422.34s]  level of something. You can use that term to give, I don't know what you, it's, it's, what are you
[422.34s -> 429.11s]  talking about? It's a, it's an instrument, it's a measurement instrument. I could have said ruler.
[430.84s -> 437.16s]  It's a, whatever. All of a sudden all the science Andes are here. I told you everyone here is smart
[437.16s -> 442.20s]  and all of a sudden, no, you need to know what the, what that, it's just a meter, not a gauge.
[442.92s -> 453.93s]  It's literally for weather. I, I'm going to keep using it for what I use it for. I, oh, it's, you
[453.93s -> 459.05s]  know, it's the barometer for this. It's the barometer for that. It's an instrument of measurement
[459.05s -> 471.19s]  of some type of fluid that fills up with the air pressure. Okay. A moment is literally only 20
[471.19s -> 478.02s]  seconds. Change your pinned tweet. What is my pinned tweet? Hold on. Let me tweet. Hold on.
[478.02s -> 485.22s]  Speaking of Twitter. Let me actually make a tweet. What is my pinned tweet? It's not a sponsor thing,
[485.22s -> 505.77s]  is it? It links to teespring.com. I don't use social media. Whatever. I'll figure it out. All
[505.77s -> 513.80s]  right. I'll fix it later. It's from 2019. I don't use social media. I don't really care.
[514.60s -> 521.24s]  You're using social media right now. I don't. Okay. I don't use text based social media.
[522.04s -> 532.22s]  Does that make sense? This is visual and audio based social media. I don't really use the text
[532.22s -> 545.80s]  based social media. Anyways, do you really care that much? This is tech. I'm typing right now.
[547.02s -> 557.58s]  I am not typing. There happens to be a chat room and you happen to be in it. I'm happen to be
[557.66s -> 566.66s]  streaming. I am talking and using my audio and visual. This chat room is an accessory to
[566.66s -> 574.58s]  this channel, right? But I'm not in it. I'm not using it right now. What were you working on?
[574.58s -> 581.69s]  You'll see. It's very important. And all the 30 minute late LOL Andes, you're going to be very,
[581.69s -> 590.57s]  very happy when you see why I was 26 minutes late. But yes, we're going to play sorcery again.
[590.57s -> 597.37s]  Sorcery today. I will be on name your price tomorrow live in person on Austin shows channel.
[601.93s -> 613.37s]  That should be really fun. And then this weekend, we will figure out what to do this weekend.
[613.37s -> 630.12s]  I have a few ideas. Are you going to bring a booster seat? Yeah, probably. Probably because
[630.12s -> 635.74s]  I need it. Oh, flipped it on you a little bit there. How he flipped it. I flipped it on you.
[638.33s -> 645.75s]  Oh, oh, no. Oh, no. Mom thinks the joke is funny. Now I got to do something else.
[657.16s -> 665.77s]  Nope. It's still funny. Whatever. All right. So yeah, that's sorcery today. Name your price
[665.77s -> 673.91s]  tomorrow. I will host the channel. Obviously, it's Austin show. I have retweeted the announcement
[673.91s -> 679.03s]  tweet for it. So if you're looking for it, it's there. I will be hosting it here. And I will.
[679.03s -> 693.45s]  That's what I'm going to be doing tomorrow. The image they used for you. Yes, because this I don't
[693.45s -> 701.11s]  take pictures. I don't really. I don't have any photos like professional photos or anything.
[701.83s -> 705.91s]  The only photos that anybody can ever pull from. If I'm a guest on any show,
[706.79s -> 713.54s]  they just have to type in Jerma into the Google image search and find one. And there's like six.
[716.20s -> 723.48s]  They use that one because that is the latest like frontal face picture where I don't look like a
[723.48s -> 734.09s]  maniac. So whatever. I don't I can't I can't do I can't do it. I just can't do it. I can't take
[734.09s -> 741.69s]  professional photos. I can't do it. The whole time I would be sitting there. And I just can't I can't
[741.69s -> 746.41s]  look into that camera and give like a smile and like, Hey, yeah, what's up? Me Jerma. Yeah,
[746.49s -> 752.09s]  use this. I'm a professional. Hey, I'm a celebrity. Yeah, I'm an Eclan. Like I can't I
[752.09s -> 764.47s]  literally cannot do it. I just can't do it. It just I feel so weird doing it. Because I just imagine
[764.47s -> 771.46s]  one of these pictures of me like smiling in the camera professional headshot. I just and I just
[771.46s -> 779.90s]  say I I look at it and go ah, I can't self conscious. No, it's not about self conscious.
[780.54s -> 789.05s]  As I pose in the mirror naked all the time and I go holy shit. I go wow. Whoa. What are you kidding
[789.05s -> 796.98s]  me? That's what I do in the mirror. But I just like I don't know publicly taking a picture of
[796.98s -> 800.26s]  yourself. That's like a professional like hey, what's Hey, you know, hey, it's me, Jerma. You
[800.26s -> 805.64s]  know me. Yeah, that's right. I'm leaning on something. I've got my elbow up. My elbows
[805.64s -> 812.44s]  resting on a chair. That's me. Yeah. Hey, sponsor this channel. I just feel so it doesn't it doesn't
[812.44s -> 829.86s]  feel right to me. It just doesn't. I'd rather them use the subspace guy picture. Author section
[829.86s -> 837.42s]  picture Andy. Yes, that's a you got it. Exactly. That's exactly what I'm talking about. I just
[837.42s -> 852.82s]  can't do it. All right. So let's go over what's going on here. Because of all the people that
[854.58s -> 872.97s]  they have missed it. Hold on. Wait, wait a minute. Okay, we're good. So today,
[873.61s -> 877.77s]  we are in part three of sorcery. Let's take a look at the map. This is where we are in this section
[877.77s -> 881.61s]  here. For those of you that did, I'm just waiting for like a few minutes to be able to trickle in.
[887.50s -> 896.07s]  We are working with time control in this episode. Part three is about aiming these devices
[896.63s -> 902.66s]  at different places in the world. And when you aim it there, this section will be in the past.
[902.66s -> 910.28s]  So it's two full maps, one on top of the other, one in the present and one in the past. The last
[910.28s -> 922.39s]  thing we did is we remember that we did the weird ant colony. We got a few items. Let's actually take
[922.39s -> 928.84s]  a look at what we have for items. Just to refresh. We opened the door. We beat Kare. We opened the
[928.84s -> 939.72s]  door. We got all the spell lines. Yes, it was the earwig colony. That's right. We still have with
[939.72s -> 954.02s]  three giants teeth. Yeah, we did get you got Elden Ringed. That's what we have just to keep in mind.
[954.02s -> 956.50s]  Let's take a look at the spells too because it's been a while. We still have the ape,
[957.06s -> 961.94s]  which is kind of insane because I've never gone through part three full episodes of this game and
[961.94s -> 969.48s]  not had something else. Again, we got Zap as lightning bolt. Poff is protective force field.
[969.48s -> 976.95s]  Law is we can control non-intelligent creatures. That was a really good one, by the way. That was
[976.95s -> 982.39s]  probably the best intelligence I've probably ever said. The way that that flowed together.
[982.39s -> 991.18s]  That was actually unbelievable. Dumb makes creatures extremely clumsy. Hot is fireball,
[991.18s -> 998.73s]  obviously. Wall is invisible wall. Here's your whole book. We can cast spells. We can refresh
[998.73s -> 1008.09s]  them if we need to. Ball Fondler, since being unbanned, has said a couple things. They've said,
[1008.09s -> 1018.84s]  when are you going to play Skyrim? Ball Fondler, you're on thin ice. We have a sword and a silver
[1018.84s -> 1026.30s]  chain. We can use this, I think, to kill ghosts or something. So let's see. What was the last
[1026.30s -> 1040.06s]  thing we did? Let's just take it slow here. Oh, wait a minute. What was the last thing I did here?
[1040.06s -> 1043.26s]  The bug clamors up the canyon's edge and drops you into the dirt, right? This is right after.
[1043.26s -> 1047.26s]  With a final nod, it turns its strides away. You call it a thank you to the bug, but it's already
[1047.26s -> 1052.63s]  gone. You look around once more. A few birds swoop and wheel in the crevice, turning circles
[1052.63s -> 1065.67s]  that are way below you. Okay, so then I did doze. I caused slowness. Let's just read what Ball Fondler
[1065.67s -> 1072.52s]  said. Let's see if it's worthy of a ban here. Ball Fondler, it's been a week and a half.
[1072.52s -> 1078.12s]  Play Skyrim. Ego Andy. Holy shit. Nice wiener, bro. He's fully naked, by the way. He's naked.
[1078.12s -> 1088.15s]  Camera or naked. Stand up. Skyrim. Play Skyrim. I will never back down. Well, I gotta tell you,
[1088.79s -> 1098.41s]  that last statement there, that shows perseverance. That shows that you can
[1098.41s -> 1109.18s]  take a life by the reins, you know what I mean? So you're okay for now. Okay, so yeah, we did slow
[1109.18s -> 1114.30s]  and we ended up slowly jumping across the gap and then falling down, right? So we're down in the chasm.
[1114.30s -> 1117.19s]  No, we made it across because we were in slow motion. All right, cool. Let's go.
[1119.53s -> 1134.71s]  Are we ready? We're ready. The world begins to slow down once more as you begin to speed up.
[1134.71s -> 1139.45s]  You feel somewhat light-headed, but otherwise well enough. The bleak plains stretch away once
[1139.45s -> 1145.10s]  more behind you. Wind whistles through the fissure. We can cast another spell. We made it across,
[1145.10s -> 1153.75s]  which the whole point was we were going to get across that chasm. Why would I? Oh, find safe
[1153.75s -> 1163.74s]  passage on the other side, okay. We could also, I think it's huff, create wind for no reason. Why?
[1164.38s -> 1175.29s]  Hey dude, I'm watching from Baodubok Ridge. This is a great stream. Hey, that's actually,
[1175.29s -> 1183.51s]  what time zone is that? You're like plus, what are you, like plus six, plus eight? That's crazy.
[1184.31s -> 1190.79s]  Do I just blow the horn? What's even ahead? There's nothing even here. Why would I just blow the
[1190.79s -> 1204.26s]  gale horn? What else can I do? I made it safely across. Why would I care? Float in the air? I
[1204.26s -> 1215.75s]  just, I made it across. Zip, cause teleportation. I think the game thinks I'm not across it yet.
[1216.31s -> 1222.62s]  No, we're just going to move on. You waste no time. You must move on. Why would I? To get,
[1222.62s -> 1229.94s]  oh, to get back across maybe. All right, we're going to follow the road. You continue across
[1229.94s -> 1234.74s]  the dusty plains. Darkness closes in. You need to rest, especially after walking all day without
[1234.74s -> 1240.44s]  eating. The road is barely visible through the dust. A few scattered bones lie in the path.
[1240.44s -> 1247.34s]  Look at the bones. You pick over a few of the bones, thin femurs, long arms, elven most likely,
[1247.34s -> 1252.10s]  but Black Elf, the wind has scoured them dry. You continue on your journey.
[1255.08s -> 1263.90s]  All right, it's time to decide where we're going to go. We need to pull. Are we going up? All right,
[1263.90s -> 1271.51s]  we're going to one, two, three. One is up north, which is heading this way. Seems pretty desolate
[1271.51s -> 1279.99s]  this way, but who knows? Might run into something over here. Two is back down to the fissure. Three
[1279.99s -> 1288.15s]  is going east this way. And four is, here's the secret fucking goddamn Elbertson family
[1288.15s -> 1318.14s]  egg salad recipe. I mulled it over. Figured, you know, this is a secret family recipe.
[1320.87s -> 1327.93s]  And I realized, what if I don't have any fucking grandkids? You all have to act as my grandchildren
[1327.93s -> 1337.77s]  because what if I don't? Well, I mean, I think I want, I think I want kids eventually, maybe.
[1337.77s -> 1343.86s]  I don't know, right? I'm thinking about it. What if I don't? You have to pass this legacy down.
[1349.58s -> 1359.21s]  Parasocial Andy. Yeah. All right. Hold on. Wait a minute. Let me fix this. Let me fix this.
[1359.21s -> 1364.84s]  I was saying that comically. You understand? I don't actually see you as my grandchildren,
[1364.84s -> 1371.32s]  right? That's fucking weird. That's strange and should not be taken seriously. Let me just be
[1371.32s -> 1383.67s]  very clear about that. But this is it. This is the real deal. Do you want me to go? Should I go over
[1383.67s -> 1388.89s]  it? I said, I thought a lot about this. I'm going, it's a secret recipe. You want me to go over it?
[1394.18s -> 1405.00s]  Okay. All right. Here we go. Secret family recipe time. I'm going to go over it very briefly. Well,
[1405.00s -> 1410.50s]  maybe not so briefly, but you know what I mean. All right. This makes enough for a few people
[1411.06s -> 1415.70s]  and it's a few, when you make it, you can put it into the fridge. It lasts for a few days.
[1415.70s -> 1419.78s]  Don't let this sit in the fridge for more than four days or so. That's kind of, you know,
[1419.78s -> 1423.96s]  I don't know. At that point, I'm not a food scientist. I'm not a food safety person.
[1423.96s -> 1430.42s]  I'm just saying it lasts for a few days. That's what it is. I don't know what happens after four,
[1430.42s -> 1441.21s]  which way, egg salad. Okay. So this is 12 eggs in a large saucepan. Make sure these are good eggs.
[1441.21s -> 1446.54s]  Make sure they're organic natural eggs. I don't know if it really matters or not, but that's what
[1446.54s -> 1457.48s]  I buy. You boil them. Get the pot boiled. Enough where you can fit this. 12 eggs. It's the whole
[1457.48s -> 1468.94s]  carton. Chicken eggs. No, not anything. What are the animal? No, chicken eggs. Who the fuck likes
[1468.94s -> 1479.03s]  egg salad? You will, if you make this recipe. Chicken eggs. Why so many? Because there's a
[1479.03s -> 1486.36s]  reason why it's so many. Here's why. If you, I just like making the whole thing because I know
[1486.36s -> 1493.50s]  I'll have enough for a few days. This is food prep. This is, you make the whole carton. Make sure
[1493.50s -> 1497.82s]  you have a big enough mixing bowl and everything, right? It's the whole carton because it's essentially
[1497.82s -> 1504.82s]  food prep. You're going to have a few days worth of this food. And by the way, you don't have to
[1504.82s -> 1510.79s]  just put this on a sandwich. It's not, oh yeah, I guess I'll put it on a sandwich. You could eat,
[1510.79s -> 1516.95s]  you could put this on other stuff. You can eat this in a, like a wrap, right? That's, I mean,
[1516.95s -> 1524.70s]  that's probably, that's kind of it. This is 30 days supply. 12 egg, what'd you say? 12 eggs in four
[1524.70s -> 1545.19s]  days is not good. Okay. Let's see your Uber Eats history. In four days, you don't eat all, is this
[1545.19s -> 1553.93s]  for like a few days and a few people? This is not a fried chicken sandwich. This is not a double
[1553.93s -> 1560.09s]  cheeseburger meal. This is an egg salad and it's healthy. It's good for you. It's got tons of
[1560.09s -> 1564.41s]  quality. I don't want to hear this bullshit about how eggs aren't good for you. That's bullshit from
[1564.41s -> 1571.21s]  the fucking seventies. I don't want to hear this nonsense that eggs, oh, you know, don't eat eggs.
[1571.21s -> 1578.04s]  I want an egg, only egg whites. Oh, egg white almond. No, I don't want to hear this. Mayo is
[1578.04s -> 1584.92s]  unhealthy. Mayo is oil. It's oil, whatever. You don't need to use the whole can. I'm not going to
[1584.92s -> 1592.28s]  hear this. I'm not going to listen to this bullshit. I'm not going to hear this. Egg salad with like a
[1592.28s -> 1597.08s]  piece of cheddar and maybe like a some, you know, on like a nice wheat roll or something or an onion
[1597.08s -> 1605.16s]  roll. That's better than a Burger King meal, okay? That's better than some of the big fatty cuts of
[1605.16s -> 1614.12s]  meat that sometimes we eat. This is not bad for you. I am, I'm going to, I'm going to continue with
[1614.12s -> 1620.54s]  my recipe. Egg salad tastes like shit. You haven't had mine. You haven't had my egg salad. I'm getting
[1620.54s -> 1628.98s]  very upset about this. What does Ball Fondler have to say about this? All right, fine. Let me get
[1628.98s -> 1640.22s]  through the recipe first and then we'll see what Ball Fondler has to say. Not yet. We'll get Ball
[1640.22s -> 1644.46s]  Fondler's opinion after and Ball Fondler, I don't want to hear it until after. I'm going to be clear.
[1645.53s -> 1652.39s]  Okay, so again, it's 12 eggs. I do that. Look, you can change this a little bit if you want to.
[1652.39s -> 1656.95s]  I do 12 eggs because I know I want to eat it for a few days. It's super easy. It's a sandwich.
[1656.95s -> 1662.63s]  You can put it anywhere. It's good. It's eggs. It's a little bit of mayo. It's a nice brown mustard.
[1663.11s -> 1668.31s]  Shut up. We're going to keep going. You peel the eggs. You put them in a large bowl and you start
[1668.31s -> 1679.29s]  to mash them, right? You can use the back end of a fork. You can use a mashed potato masher and you go
[1680.89s -> 1687.64s]  mush them up, right? But don't do it too much and don't do it too little. 12 eggs is literally a
[1687.64s -> 1691.48s]  week worth of salad. Well, that's a pissing ho- All right, forget about the quantity.
[1692.44s -> 1703.06s]  Forget about the quantity. Listen, you want me to share my secret family recipe with you or not?
[1703.06s -> 1712.28s]  Do you use your feet to mash these with? Stop. All right, listen to me. After you mash them up,
[1712.28s -> 1721.72s]  and not huge whole egg chunks, it needs to be enough where it's uniform. It's not a paste,
[1721.72s -> 1726.28s]  though. I don't want it not like sawdust. Chunky, but not too ridiculous. You want to be able to
[1726.28s -> 1733.00s]  scoop it up with a spoon. Okay, one tablespoon of mayonnaise goes into this. Don't use anything else.
[1733.00s -> 1741.77s]  You'll ruin it. If people use, what's the other stuff that's gross or like any other kind of
[1742.33s -> 1748.30s]  other mayo type stuff? Oh, I forget what it's called. Like, what's it called? I don't even-
[1748.30s -> 1753.43s]  Miracle Whip. Don't use Miracle Whip. It's not for my recipe. I'm sorry. That's not how it works.
[1753.43s -> 1758.55s]  There's other like mayo alternatives. No, it's a real mayo recipe. Real mayonnaise. Don't use
[1758.55s -> 1761.59s]  anything else. Your friends will think it's gross and then they'll make fun of me for having a bad
[1761.59s -> 1769.78s]  recipe. Fold in the mayo. You add one tablespoon periodically. Don't just squeeze in mayonnaise
[1769.78s -> 1775.38s]  and fucking ruin it. It's one to two tablespoons periodically as you're folding it in. It's going
[1775.38s -> 1784.09s]  to get to a consistency where all the eggs are coated. It's kind of melding together. It's folding
[1784.09s -> 1793.70s]  together. Make sure it's thick and chunky to pick up but not too, like not paste, right? Here it is.
[1793.70s -> 1799.70s]  Two tablespoons of Tabasco Original Hot Sauce. Fold that in. You can add a little bit more or a little
[1799.70s -> 1808.15s]  less depending on how you like it. There are some people that think hot sauce is awful and don't
[1808.15s -> 1814.74s]  want it at all. Then just don't use it. But this is my recipe. It's going to turn into this, I said
[1814.74s -> 1818.02s]  nuclear orange, right? But like, you know what I mean? It's going to turn into this orange.
[1820.62s -> 1829.56s]  This sounds foul. You haven't even tried it. When did you try this? So it's going to turn into this
[1829.56s -> 1835.32s]  like kind of orange egg salad. Don't use too much. Start small and taste it. You need to get your chef
[1835.32s -> 1839.48s]  here. You got to like mix it in and like, oh okay that's a little too much or that's too little.
[1839.48s -> 1844.44s]  Get it to where you like it. Then two tablespoons of ground brown mustard important. It's the one
[1844.44s -> 1850.18s]  with the seeds in it. Don't put the yellow mustard in here. You can do a little bit less if you want
[1850.18s -> 1856.98s]  but this is to add a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of spiciness to it. Not heat but you
[1856.98s -> 1863.74s]  know that like kind of nose tang that brown mustard has. After this, and remember you're
[1863.74s -> 1871.06s]  folding this in. Do a little bit. Don't do it all. It adds kick but not heat. Exactly. You get it.
[1871.06s -> 1876.90s]  Thank you. Kick but not heat. That's the point. That's the purpose. One teaspoon, don't read this
[1876.90s -> 1883.22s]  wrong. One teaspoon of onion powder. One teaspoon of salt. One teaspoon of pepper. Not more than that.
[1883.22s -> 1891.50s]  Actually probably less than that. I explain in the next paragraph. This is why it's so hard
[1891.50s -> 1895.34s]  to write this because some people think I don't want it to be salty. I want it to be more salty.
[1895.34s -> 1907.88s]  I wish it was more mustardy. By the way this is just for 12 eggs. Just salt. Just regular table salt.
[1907.88s -> 1913.08s]  Why did this take you 26 minutes to write? This took me 15 minutes to write and I was taking a
[1913.08s -> 1919.56s]  shit for fucking 20 minutes. Okay? There you go. You want the real story? Sometimes stuff is better
[1919.56s -> 1932.28s]  left unsaid. I'm sorry. Anyways, when I'm thinking about teaspoons and tablespoons,
[1933.14s -> 1935.22s]  I'm thinking you know when you get the pepper grinder and you go like
[1938.66s -> 1942.26s]  how much is that? Is that a teaspoon? It's however many
[1942.66s -> 1957.16s]  uh graz seven is. It's six or seven graz of pepper. That's probably a teaspoon. Is that less? Half
[1957.16s -> 1972.68s]  a teaspoon? If I would if I go like that would be about probably one teaspoon, right? Let me just,
[1972.68s -> 1978.98s]  I gotta... I gotta fix this. This is wrong. Don't take this recipe yet. It's not right. It's not
[1978.98s -> 2004.55s]  accurate yet. Hold on. That's that's more accurate. I- I'm just gonna be honest. Just to taste. Yeah,
[2004.55s -> 2010.02s]  Yeah, but, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. That's true. That's true. True, true, true, true, true.
[2010.02s -> 2025.20s]  Add salt to taste. Add—but this—wait, this is way too much onion powder. Hold on. How much is this?
[2025.20s -> 2033.96s]  How much is a teaspoon of onion powder? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is that way too much?
[2033.96s -> 2047.36s]  I don't know measurements. A pinch? Add two—add three pinches of onion powder.
[2047.36s -> 2051.52s]  It's like you just add, like, a shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, and then mix it in. I don't know. I just do—
[2051.52s -> 2064.06s]  That's—chefs don't keep track. Baking is an art. It's not a science. Is that a correct thing to say?
[2064.06s -> 2074.89s]  Back in, like, the fucking 1200s, you know how many types of bread they figured out by just trying different things?
[2074.89s -> 2078.27s]  Half of the breads that you love to eat were done because somebody was like,
[2078.27s -> 2093.38s]  I don't fucking know. Let's try it like this. Who cares? Okay. So this is important.
[2093.38s -> 2099.56s]  This is all to taste. That's fine. Get a bulky roll. Preferably an onion roll. A bulky onion roll.
[2099.56s -> 2105.64s]  You know the ones. You've seen them. You want to spread that egg salad onto the bottom of the bun.
[2105.64s -> 2108.92s]  And then you're going to add one slice of cheddar cheese. I don't care what kind it is.
[2108.92s -> 2117.48s]  It could be sharp or even mild, depends on what you want. If you like sharp cheese, that's fine.
[2117.48s -> 2123.62s]  When this is done, you're going to take a bite and you're going to—taste it as you go.
[2123.62s -> 2128.92s]  I don't know what an onion roll is. Yes, you do. This sounds so damn good.
[2128.92s -> 2134.55s]  Yes, it does. It actually does. You are going to take a bite of this and go,
[2134.55s -> 2145.90s]  oh, okay, this is like kind of good. I have had egg salad before and I've made my own and I finally got it to where I like it.
[2145.90s -> 2156.64s]  What the hell is sharp cheese? Stop. Stop gaslighting me. Why did you leak this?
[2156.64s -> 2161.44s]  Because I don't know. I just was like, I want to get this down in case I get hit by a bus.
[2161.44s -> 2167.34s]  What if I—you know what I mean? What if I get hit by a bus? No one would ever know what this was.
[2167.38s -> 2176.19s]  Okay. So, you got it? You good? Okay.
[2176.19s -> 2186.61s]  What does Ball Fondler have to say about it? Curious.
[2186.61s -> 2204.63s]  Everyone wants Ball Fondler's take, so we're going to get it.
[2204.63s -> 2209.19s]  This isn't funny anymore, bro. Just play the game. And then they at me.
[2209.19s -> 2214.70s]  Egg salad Andy. 12 eggs. You really fell off since the last stream.
[2214.70s -> 2223.47s]  School homework Andy. He's cold.
[2223.47s -> 2237.79s]  You really fell off from two days ago?
[2237.79s -> 2248.56s]  You peaked at Pac-Man. All right, let's go.
[2248.56s -> 2258.01s]  This is a family recipe of a spinoff shitty sitcom. Where do you want to go?
[2258.01s -> 2266.83s]  You got the recipe. And by the way, all those anti-sorcery Andes that don't give it to them.
[2266.83s -> 2271.59s]  Don't let them have that recipe. That's for you. Only for like the 10k that are here right now.
[2271.59s -> 2277.49s]  That's for all the anti-sorcery Andes. That's not for them.
[2277.49s -> 2284.04s]  This is just eggs with mayo in it. Did you not read the part about the brown mustard did?
[2284.04s -> 2288.68s]  Did you not read the part about the Tabasco? Did you not read the part about how the consistency needs to be?
[2288.68s -> 2292.48s]  Do not read the part about the sharp cheddar cheese? Did you not read the part about how it needs to be folded?
[2292.48s -> 2294.02s]  And the ingredients going.
[2294.02s -> 2297.16s]  One at a time. Do not read the part about the dry ingredients go last.
[2297.16s -> 2301.06s]  Did you not read the part about it has to be not a paste? If it's runny, you got it wrong.
[2301.06s -> 2308.49s]  Did you not read the part about it has to be twelve eggs? Which part of the image you did not read.
[2308.49s -> 2314.71s]  All right. Looks like we're going to go east. 12312 three one.
[2314.71s -> 2329.04s]  One, two, three.
[2329.04s -> 2331.44s]  All right, we're going three.
[2331.44s -> 2332.28s]  Let's go.
[2335.20s -> 2338.00s]  We can't see your mouse?
[2338.00s -> 2339.84s]  Oh, well it was one, two, three.
[2339.84s -> 2342.52s]  Yeah, you could.
[2342.52s -> 2344.00s]  All right, the line of the road curves gently
[2344.00s -> 2344.84s]  as you follow it.
[2344.84s -> 2349.24s]  The moon moves slowly across the sky like a lidless eye.
[2349.24s -> 2350.56s]  The plains are wide and empty.
[2350.56s -> 2352.04s]  To the south, the fissure yawns.
[2352.04s -> 2354.43s]  Wide are here and furiously deep.
[2354.43s -> 2358.72s]  To the north, the land climbs a low rocky rise.
[2358.72s -> 2361.53s]  It's a streamer's choice.
[2361.53s -> 2364.95s]  We're gonna go up, off the road.
[2364.95s -> 2368.01s]  You leave the road and cut across the bone gray plain.
[2368.01s -> 2369.81s]  You're climbing up a low rocky rise,
[2369.81s -> 2372.05s]  not a natural outcrop as you first assumed,
[2372.05s -> 2374.93s]  but rather a pile of large carved blocks
[2374.93s -> 2380.36s]  over which the dust of many ages has blown.
[2380.36s -> 2381.44s]  Let's go.
[2381.44s -> 2383.32s]  You peer in between the largest stone blocks
[2383.32s -> 2386.24s]  and shift a few smaller ones out of the way.
[2386.24s -> 2387.52s]  You see nothing.
[2387.52s -> 2390.36s]  And then the glimpse of blue shines through.
[2390.36s -> 2391.80s]  Is it a gem?
[2391.80s -> 2393.46s]  A small lizard scurries out
[2393.46s -> 2397.51s]  from between two of the fallen blocks.
[2397.51s -> 2406.80s]  What can we do here?
[2406.82s -> 2409.74s]  Mud, great quicksand.
[2409.74s -> 2414.16s]  I could probably, yeah, I could do big and move the rocks.
[2414.16s -> 2419.87s]  I could do six, clone the caster.
[2419.87s -> 2424.78s]  So there's just six of us.
[2424.78s -> 2429.54s]  How, show how what it looks like so I get it right.
[2429.54s -> 2436.22s]  I don't have a picture of it.
[2436.22s -> 2437.66s]  Dopp is open locks and doors.
[2437.66s -> 2443.40s]  I probably, it was just, let's do, I'm thinking big.
[2443.40s -> 2447.96s]  Big or six, we'll do six, six is fun.
[2447.96s -> 2451.46s]  Yeah, we'll clone the caster, make it quicker.
[2451.46s -> 2452.82s]  Looking to the constellations overhead,
[2452.82s -> 2456.04s]  you craft a spell and five clones step out from behind you
[2456.04s -> 2458.92s]  forming a semi-circle.
[2458.92s -> 2465.17s]  Form a human pyramid, for fun?
[2465.17s -> 2468.31s]  All right, we're gonna form a human pyramid.
[2468.31s -> 2470.07s]  You organize a human pyramid
[2470.07s -> 2472.31s]  hoping to get a view across the land.
[2472.31s -> 2474.11s]  You place three clones abreast
[2474.11s -> 2475.91s]  then two more on top of them.
[2475.91s -> 2478.55s]  And finally you scrambled to the top yourself.
[2478.55s -> 2483.32s]  The view across the plane is incredible.
[2483.32s -> 2485.77s]  All right, let's look to the mountains.
[2485.77s -> 2486.89s]  You look over at the mountains,
[2486.89s -> 2489.15s]  but before you can make anything out, the spell fades.
[2489.17s -> 2490.41s]  Your clones vanish and you land
[2490.41s -> 2492.66s]  in a painful heap on the ground.
[2492.66s -> 2498.41s]  That's great.
[2502.18s -> 2510.61s]  I'm just gonna get huge.
[2510.61s -> 2514.20s]  Let's do big.
[2514.20s -> 2516.04s]  You turn the starlight into alignment around you
[2516.04s -> 2517.36s]  for a moment it seems nothing will happen
[2517.36s -> 2518.94s]  then suddenly you begin to grow
[2518.94s -> 2522.31s]  to three times your normal size.
[2522.31s -> 2525.01s]  Your clones grow at the same time.
[2525.01s -> 2529.40s]  Wait, I thought they were gone.
[2529.40s -> 2531.54s]  What is this?
[2531.54s -> 2536.12s]  I thought they vanished.
[2536.12s -> 2538.62s]  Should we make a pyramid as being huge?
[2538.62s -> 2541.32s]  All right, let's clear the rubble.
[2541.32s -> 2542.68s]  You and your five enormous,
[2542.68s -> 2544.84s]  wait, does it vanish as in they ran away?
[2544.84s -> 2549.53s]  Like they just let me fall?
[2549.53s -> 2551.29s]  You and your five enormous clones set out
[2551.29s -> 2552.47s]  about clearing the rubble.
[2552.47s -> 2555.29s]  Working in threes, you're able to shift the stones aside.
[2555.29s -> 2556.15s]  After a few minutes of work,
[2556.15s -> 2559.35s]  you've uncovered the blue crystal.
[2559.35s -> 2562.05s]  All right, take the blue crystal.
[2562.05s -> 2564.55s]  Gradually you shrink back down to your normal size.
[2564.55s -> 2566.68s]  One by one, your clones vanish.
[2566.68s -> 2567.66s]  You touch the blue crystal
[2567.66s -> 2571.92s]  and suddenly you feel yourself ascending.
[2571.92s -> 2573.52s]  Oh, you can teleport.
[2573.52s -> 2574.64s]  That's right.
[2574.64s -> 2579.85s]  It's fast travel on this.
[2579.85s -> 2582.68s]  Okay.
[2582.68s -> 2587.20s]  So, I mean, I think the idea is I teleport back here,
[2587.20s -> 2590.56s]  move this over here to the bridge when it's back normally
[2590.56s -> 2596.82s]  or this way, go back to the cave.
[2596.82s -> 2602.97s]  I could move this, go back to the cave.
[2602.97s -> 2603.81s]  Let's see, let me see.
[2603.81s -> 2612.04s]  Let me see, let's take a look.
[2612.04s -> 2614.00s]  Moment later, you're tumbling downwards from the sky,
[2614.00s -> 2615.36s]  the wind rushing past your face.
[2615.36s -> 2618.60s]  You are certain to shatter into a thousand pieces
[2618.60s -> 2620.48s]  and suddenly you're on the ground once more.
[2620.48s -> 2621.82s]  You're back on top of the stone tower
[2621.82s -> 2623.70s]  in the area near the southern cliffs.
[2623.70s -> 2627.88s]  The beacon is lit, it's polished crystal eye-blazing.
[2629.96s -> 2634.96s]  So, we could go like this.
[2634.96s -> 2645.32s]  We didn't do over here back in the past.
[2645.32s -> 2647.60s]  We could fix the bridge and kind of go across it
[2647.60s -> 2650.07s]  and see what happens or we could...
[2650.07s -> 2651.47s]  Ah, right.
[2651.47s -> 2655.52s]  Okay, so we could fix it and then have another one lit
[2655.52s -> 2661.80s]  and have it go somewhere else.
[2661.80s -> 2668.52s]  I think, okay, so if I go like this
[2668.52s -> 2673.68s]  and then I can go to this one and aim this one that way.
[2673.68s -> 2680.52s]  Let's do that.
[2680.52s -> 2681.76s]  Now we're in the past
[2681.76s -> 2688.64s]  and I'm gonna aim this back at the bridge.
[2688.64s -> 2690.72s]  Okay.
[2690.72s -> 2693.20s]  The fall from the sky is just as terrifying as before
[2693.20s -> 2695.08s]  but you land safely once again.
[2695.08s -> 2697.58s]  Takes a moment for you to regain your breath, incredible.
[2697.58s -> 2700.52s]  You're atop a stone tower which did not exist before
[2700.52s -> 2703.68s]  in the northern plains of Barubak.
[2703.68s -> 2705.64s]  Set into the floor here is a bearing track
[2705.64s -> 2707.76s]  on which a brass cylinder rests.
[2707.76s -> 2710.88s]  A blue crystal is set in.
[2710.88s -> 2712.22s]  You pat yourself down, check yourself over.
[2712.22s -> 2716.78s]  You're in one piece if a little breathless.
[2716.78s -> 2718.32s]  You waste no time in turning your attention
[2718.32s -> 2720.50s]  to the contraption on the rooftop.
[2720.50s -> 2722.38s]  The cylinder is similar to the one you saw earlier
[2722.38s -> 2724.12s]  although this one is slightly narrower
[2724.12s -> 2726.68s]  and about a cubit long.
[2726.68s -> 2728.08s]  On one of the side of the turret,
[2728.08s -> 2730.84s]  on one side of the turret floor is a trap door
[2730.84s -> 2734.96s]  which is closed.
[2734.96s -> 2739.16s]  So yeah, now we can go like this.
[2739.16s -> 2740.43s]  Okay.
[2740.43s -> 2742.81s]  I think I like this right now.
[2742.81s -> 2743.63s]  What do you think?
[2743.63s -> 2745.50s]  Should I go back to the bridge here?
[2745.50s -> 2747.46s]  Back in the past?
[2747.46s -> 2749.52s]  See what's here?
[2749.52s -> 2755.26s]  Or aim it this way or aim it this way.
[2755.26s -> 2758.13s]  Oh shit.
[2758.13s -> 2759.64s]  What do you think?
[2759.64s -> 2766.99s]  The one piece is real.
[2766.99s -> 2769.07s]  The one, what's the, what do you mean?
[2769.07s -> 2770.41s]  Go find the earwigs in the past.
[2770.41s -> 2772.18s]  I think I'm gonna do this
[2772.18s -> 2774.20s]  because then when I go across the bridge,
[2774.20s -> 2776.48s]  we can check out this area
[2776.48s -> 2777.88s]  and then in the present,
[2777.88s -> 2782.53s]  we can go check out the cave too
[2782.53s -> 2784.35s]  because I can get it aimed at the right angle.
[2784.35s -> 2785.19s]  Yeah, there we go.
[2785.19s -> 2786.03s]  All right.
[2786.03s -> 2791.53s]  That makes sense to me.
[2791.53s -> 2802.83s]  All right.
[2802.83s -> 2803.67s]  What about the trap door?
[2803.67s -> 2807.56s]  Can do big again.
[2807.56s -> 2815.40s]  Can do fog, summon darkness, force field.
[2815.40s -> 2816.52s]  Is there a sus?
[2816.52s -> 2817.36s]  There's no sus.
[2817.36s -> 2821.98s]  What about, I mean, I can probably just open it.
[2821.98s -> 2824.05s]  Don't give it up.
[2824.05s -> 2824.89s]  Give it up.
[2824.89s -> 2825.73s]  Give it up.
[2825.73s -> 2826.57s]  Give it up.
[2826.57s -> 2827.41s]  Give it up.
[2827.41s -> 2828.25s]  Give it up.
[2828.25s -> 2829.09s]  Give it up.
[2829.09s -> 2829.93s]  Give it up.
[2829.93s -> 2832.78s]  Give it up.
[2832.78s -> 2833.62s]  Give it up.
[2833.62s -> 2835.28s]  Give it up.
[2835.28s -> 2836.10s]  Give it up.
[2836.10s -> 2838.65s]  Give it up.
[2838.65s -> 2840.33s]  Turn your attention from the beam
[2840.33s -> 2842.46s]  to the trap door in the floor.
[2842.46s -> 2843.96s]  You need to get down from here somehow.
[2843.96s -> 2846.62s]  The trap door has an iron ring for a handle.
[2846.62s -> 2849.37s]  You give it a sharp tug, but it doesn't move an inch.
[2849.37s -> 2852.21s]  Where are we right now?
[2852.21s -> 2853.05s]  All right.
[2853.05s -> 2859.36s]  I'm thinking, correct me if I'm wrong here, audience.
[2859.36s -> 2861.78s]  We go up, explore all this in the,
[2861.78s -> 2866.09s]  we go up and explore all this in the past.
[2866.09s -> 2868.67s]  Wrap back down this way.
[2868.67s -> 2870.61s]  Check this out in the past.
[2870.61s -> 2873.71s]  End up at the cave in the present.
[2877.10s -> 2880.61s]  And then come back around this way
[2880.61s -> 2883.58s]  and potentially either go out here or come back up here.
[2883.58s -> 2890.04s]  That's not good?
[2890.04s -> 2891.20s]  Already did the cave.
[2891.20s -> 2893.16s]  We did, but remember in the past,
[2893.16s -> 2898.47s]  we went back and we talked to the sorcerer, sorceress lady.
[2898.47s -> 2900.59s]  I just made your egg salad and it tastes like gasoline.
[2900.59s -> 2906.08s]  It would have taken you longer to do that and know you're a liar.
[2906.08s -> 2906.96s]  All right, I like that idea.
[2906.96s -> 2911.95s]  Let's go check out this place up here.
[2911.95s -> 2913.03s]  You know how I know it's bullshit?
[2913.03s -> 2916.15s]  Because it takes at least 12 minutes to boil the eggs.
[2916.15s -> 2919.31s]  And then it takes like 15 to 30 plus minutes.
[2919.35s -> 2923.03s]  It's like a 20 minute ordeal to peel those eggs.
[2923.03s -> 2924.67s]  And then it takes another puppy five to 10 minutes
[2924.67s -> 2928.98s]  to fold in all the ingredients, you're a liar.
[2928.98s -> 2929.82s]  All right, should I twist it?
[2929.82s -> 2932.48s]  I'm gonna twist it.
[2932.48s -> 2934.28s]  You turn the iron ring, it doesn't shift.
[2934.28s -> 2936.04s]  Twist it again.
[2936.04s -> 2937.72s]  Undeterred, you twist the ring again,
[2937.72s -> 2938.92s]  but don't seem to get anywhere.
[2938.92s -> 2941.14s]  Twist it again.
[2941.14s -> 2944.06s]  You tug the ring, but you seem to be wasting your time.
[2944.06s -> 2947.15s]  Tug, twist it again.
[2947.15s -> 2949.03s]  Once again, you fiddle with the metal ring,
[2949.03s -> 2952.35s]  but however hard you wriggle and wrench at the trap door,
[2952.35s -> 2955.34s]  nothing is happening.
[2955.34s -> 2960.75s]  Give up, no, I wanna cast a spell.
[2960.75s -> 2964.20s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, go back.
[2964.20s -> 2965.64s]  I wanna, hold on, go back, go back.
[2965.64s -> 2975.67s]  This doesn't count as a rewind.
[2975.67s -> 2986.73s]  Okay, we're good.
[2986.73s -> 2989.92s]  There we go, all right, we're good.
[2989.92s -> 2994.25s]  All right, the trap door, open the trap door.
[2994.25s -> 3001.62s]  Wait, I thought, there is no cast a spell.
[3001.62s -> 3007.20s]  Oh, okay, I can do it here.
[3007.20s -> 3009.77s]  Let's do dop, it's easiest, right?
[3009.77s -> 3011.37s]  Dop is pretty much guaranteed.
[3011.37s -> 3016.57s]  Open locks and doors.
[3016.57s -> 3018.73s]  All right, you weave the spell and turn the spell's focus
[3018.73s -> 3019.97s]  into the trap door at your feet.
[3019.97s -> 3023.73s]  It shivers and rattles as though the wood was a beetle
[3023.73s -> 3025.56s]  trying to take flight.
[3025.60s -> 3029.14s]  But it seems unable to escape whatever is holding it shut.
[3029.14s -> 3035.43s]  The spell fades with the trap door still sealed.
[3035.43s -> 3048.22s]  What?
[3048.22s -> 3060.27s]  Did I just get huge and stomp through it?
[3060.27s -> 3061.77s]  All right, you bind the magic quickly,
[3061.77s -> 3066.67s]  swelling to the height of a tree.
[3066.67s -> 3067.51s]  I can't, what?
[3067.51s -> 3075.81s]  I can't like stomp through it?
[3075.81s -> 3078.41s]  You swing one massive leg over the side of the tower
[3078.41s -> 3080.05s]  and hop down to ground level.
[3080.05s -> 3084.16s]  Oh, okay, falling, what?
[3084.16s -> 3092.87s]  Oh, okay, so I just sprained my ankle.
[3092.87s -> 3094.99s]  You hit the ground with a heavy thump.
[3094.99s -> 3097.11s]  Gradually, you shrink back down to your normal size.
[3097.11s -> 3100.18s]  Looking back up, the tower seems terribly high.
[3100.18s -> 3101.56s]  Try the door.
[3101.56s -> 3102.76s]  You try the door, but it is locked.
[3102.76s -> 3105.89s]  Still, at least this tower has a door.
[3105.89s -> 3124.90s]  Oh my God.
[3124.90s -> 3127.55s]  It's too much, I only have three stamina.
[3127.55s -> 3129.15s]  I don't wanna blow the door off.
[3129.15s -> 3135.18s]  Let's stop the door.
[3135.18s -> 3138.10s]  Tumblers inside the tower door click.
[3138.10s -> 3139.70s]  Then a moment later, they roll over completely
[3139.70s -> 3141.69s]  and the door swings open.
[3141.69s -> 3142.77s]  The night air is cold.
[3142.77s -> 3146.49s]  The air is like ice.
[3146.49s -> 3148.65s]  So I spent all that time with the trap door.
[3148.65s -> 3153.10s]  Okay, we'll go inside.
[3153.10s -> 3156.46s]  You step through the tower door into the cool shade within.
[3156.46s -> 3157.70s]  Who knows how long it has been
[3157.70s -> 3163.30s]  since anyone last set foot inside, okay?
[3163.30s -> 3165.98s]  You stand in a wide, cool cavernous space.
[3165.98s -> 3168.10s]  The roof disappears off above you,
[3168.10s -> 3170.42s]  dimly echoing your footsteps.
[3170.42s -> 3173.90s]  The air is musty, perhaps undisturbed for centuries.
[3173.90s -> 3178.14s]  The room is filled with a thin, sickly smell.
[3178.14s -> 3180.50s]  You take a deep lungful of the stale air,
[3180.50s -> 3182.46s]  smelling something sweet and musty
[3182.46s -> 3184.76s]  that takes a moment to place.
[3184.76s -> 3188.51s]  It is the smell of tombs, graveyards, and crypts,
[3188.51s -> 3190.33s]  but not of decay.
[3190.33s -> 3191.75s]  Then you place it.
[3191.75s -> 3196.59s]  This is the Elbertson egg salad family recipe,
[3196.59s -> 3202.20s]  one of the most cherished secrets in all of Aniland.
[3202.20s -> 3204.61s]  This is the smell of dark vine,
[3204.61s -> 3208.35s]  a thick climbing plant that grows only in dark places.
[3208.35s -> 3209.43s]  Thankfully, it's not harmful
[3209.43s -> 3212.74s]  unless eaten in very large quantities.
[3212.74s -> 3213.90s]  Okay.
[3217.81s -> 3219.25s]  I'm casting a lot of spells.
[3227.86s -> 3229.02s]  Heal disease, I don't,
[3229.02s -> 3233.41s]  I mean, something's diseased in here, maybe.
[3233.41s -> 3242.50s]  Sun, ooh, create light.
[3243.10s -> 3244.46s]  I don't wanna do big in here.
[3244.46s -> 3248.73s]  I'll get crushed.
[3248.73s -> 3250.50s]  Darkness.
[3250.50s -> 3255.72s]  I think it's, yeah, let's do sun jewel.
[3255.72s -> 3257.52s]  You craft the enchantment and the sun jewel in your pack
[3257.52s -> 3259.48s]  begins to emit a brilliant, blinding light.
[3259.48s -> 3262.11s]  Warm light fills the chamber.
[3262.11s -> 3264.39s]  You look around the tower and the light from the jewel.
[3264.39s -> 3266.39s]  You make out strange, shadowy shapes
[3266.39s -> 3269.00s]  that climb the stonework.
[3269.00s -> 3271.88s]  The shapes seem to recede from the light.
[3271.88s -> 3274.48s]  They are dark vines, plants that grow only in unlit places.
[3274.48s -> 3279.90s]  They form a thick matting across the ceiling.
[3279.90s -> 3283.49s]  Let's cut them down.
[3283.49s -> 3284.89s]  You climb to the top of the stairs
[3284.89s -> 3287.97s]  and hack at the dark vines that grow across the ceilings.
[3287.97s -> 3290.53s]  They begin to drip a thick, oozing sap
[3290.53s -> 3296.96s]  onto the floor of the tower.
[3301.86s -> 3303.74s]  Try to just keep it up.
[3303.74s -> 3304.86s]  Search the room.
[3304.86s -> 3308.28s]  Yeah, this is probably like poisonous.
[3308.28s -> 3309.48s]  Instead of going through the hatch,
[3309.48s -> 3312.28s]  you use the light to poke around the corners of the room.
[3312.28s -> 3314.24s]  You find little of interest until you stumble over
[3314.24s -> 3317.07s]  what appears to be an old traveling pack.
[3317.07s -> 3319.26s]  Open it or kick it.
[3319.26s -> 3320.79s]  Let's kick it.
[3320.79s -> 3323.23s]  You give it an experimental kick.
[3323.23s -> 3325.87s]  It does not move, but only rattles a little.
[3325.91s -> 3330.38s]  There's gonna be a snake in here.
[3330.38s -> 3332.94s]  Is that rattle an adjective
[3332.94s -> 3338.69s]  or is that rattle an animal verb?
[3338.69s -> 3339.65s]  Do you know what I mean?
[3339.65s -> 3340.49s]  Like, what is that?
[3340.49s -> 3345.62s]  Is that adjective or verb?
[3345.62s -> 3346.70s]  It rattles a little.
[3346.70s -> 3348.66s]  Like, oh, my desk rattled.
[3348.66s -> 3351.38s]  Or is it like rattle, is it like an animal verb
[3351.38s -> 3352.78s]  or is this an adjective
[3352.78s -> 3363.83s]  for describing something moving around?
[3363.83s -> 3366.63s]  You open the pack and are surprised to find the brand
[3366.63s -> 3370.46s]  of the Aniland leatherers inside the top of the flap.
[3370.46s -> 3376.06s]  Digging inside, you find two stopped vials.
[3376.06s -> 3378.40s]  Examine the purple vial.
[3378.40s -> 3381.16s]  You lift the purple vial and shake it in the lift.
[3381.16s -> 3383.84s]  Liquid inside is thin, but shines slightly.
[3383.84s -> 3386.32s]  You recognize it, of course, blimberry.
[3386.32s -> 3389.26s]  You put it in your pack, an excellent find.
[3389.26s -> 3391.29s]  What about the brown one?
[3391.29s -> 3393.41s]  The brown vial contains a thick oil
[3393.41s -> 3395.70s]  that you do not recognize.
[3395.70s -> 3399.10s]  Drink it immediately.
[3399.10s -> 3406.77s]  Um, maybe I shouldn't take it.
[3406.77s -> 3407.61s]  Taste it.
[3410.22s -> 3415.38s]  Should I smell it first?
[3415.38s -> 3417.39s]  You unstopper the vial.
[3417.39s -> 3420.59s]  A heady, woody smell fills your nostrils.
[3420.59s -> 3422.81s]  This is an essence of bark,
[3422.81s -> 3425.13s]  much like the one you acquired in Carré.
[3425.13s -> 3428.73s]  A good thing you did not try to taste it.
[3428.73s -> 3431.09s]  You guys better just turn me into a tree or something.
[3431.09s -> 3437.06s]  All right, we're gonna keep it, okay?
[3437.06s -> 3438.74s]  I need, I'm gonna die.
[3439.78s -> 3442.74s]  All right, should I cut the vines or just rest?
[3442.74s -> 3445.94s]  This seems like a safe enough place.
[3445.94s -> 3448.50s]  This is a calm sheltered place to rest.
[3448.50s -> 3450.06s]  You should be protected from the elements
[3450.06s -> 3452.90s]  and from any creatures about at night.
[3452.90s -> 3455.26s]  You have eaten nothing today, but you have no,
[3455.26s -> 3456.58s]  you don't have any food.
[3456.58s -> 3461.86s]  And only a single vial of healing blimberry juice.
[3462.26s -> 3466.35s]  I kind of have to drink this.
[3466.35s -> 3467.91s]  You unstopper your vial of blimberry
[3467.91s -> 3469.51s]  and knock it quickly back.
[3469.51s -> 3470.79s]  You feel a little better,
[3470.79s -> 3473.45s]  and all traces of hunger are soon gone.
[3473.45s -> 3475.25s]  Then you stretch out and rest.
[3475.25s -> 3480.10s]  You seem guarded here, and you do not dream.
[3480.10s -> 3482.58s]  You reach the Northern Plains and met Elthera,
[3482.58s -> 3483.66s]  the mystic again.
[3483.66s -> 3492.70s]  That's who was in the cave, if you remember.
[3492.70s -> 3493.98s]  The sun may have risen outside,
[3493.98s -> 3497.26s]  but the only windows here are thin slots.
[3497.26s -> 3498.28s]  I almost coughed.
[3499.20s -> 3501.60s]  The inside of the tower is cavernous and empty,
[3501.60s -> 3504.80s]  but for a stone staircase that spirals around the walls.
[3504.80s -> 3506.56s]  Dark vines have grown up the inside of the tower
[3506.56s -> 3510.98s]  and form a thick matting across the ceiling.
[3510.98s -> 3518.13s]  Should I just keep cutting these?
[3518.13s -> 3524.03s]  I feel like that's a bad idea.
[3524.03s -> 3532.06s]  That's definitely a bad idea.
[3532.06s -> 3536.71s]  No, we don't do face cam for sorcery.
[3536.71s -> 3540.55s]  I need you to be immersed into the text in the story.
[3540.55s -> 3545.42s]  Not looking at like the boogers coming out of my nose.
[3545.42s -> 3546.89s]  No, we're gonna move on.
[3546.89s -> 3551.20s]  I think that's a bad idea.
[3551.20s -> 3553.20s]  You step out into the sunlight at the base of the tower.
[3553.20s -> 3554.20s]  You march onwards.
[3554.20s -> 3555.64s]  You have been wandering the backlands
[3555.64s -> 3557.50s]  for three days already.
[3557.50s -> 3560.19s]  You've not crossed the ridge,
[3560.19s -> 3565.56s]  but we did back in the present.
[3565.56s -> 3571.45s]  All right, so do you guys like that plan
[3571.45s -> 3576.88s]  of kind of go up this way and then down and then up here?
[3578.32s -> 3582.94s]  You guys like that plan?
[3582.94s -> 3588.43s]  We'll go up, circle back around, cross the bridge,
[3588.43s -> 3591.11s]  check out what this is and check out what this is.
[3591.11s -> 3592.31s]  That's a good idea.
[3592.31s -> 3593.15s]  Let's go for it.
[3593.15s -> 3598.38s]  All right, we don't need to pull.
[3598.38s -> 3600.29s]  Let's check out this.
[3600.29s -> 3602.65s]  You walk for half an hour across the grassland,
[3602.65s -> 3604.25s]  keeping your eyes and ears open.
[3604.25s -> 3607.67s]  The light from your sun jewel pulses twice and fades.
[3607.67s -> 3610.81s]  The air moves a little, still icy, but fresh.
[3610.81s -> 3612.69s]  In the middle of a tended field,
[3612.69s -> 3616.88s]  you come across a lone hut.
[3616.88s -> 3618.96s]  Peering through the grimy windows of the hut,
[3618.96s -> 3622.78s]  you see a stooped young boy sitting by a fire.
[3622.78s -> 3626.37s]  He's squatting on the ground, intent on something,
[3626.37s -> 3638.55s]  perhaps drawing symbols in the dust.
[3638.55s -> 3640.71s]  Hmm, we don't wanna get it.
[3640.71s -> 3642.75s]  Oh, and important, your egg salad may be gassy.
[3642.75s -> 3644.80s]  It smells bad.
[3645.44s -> 3646.64s]  That's eggs.
[3646.64s -> 3648.48s]  Eggs are a gassy food.
[3648.48s -> 3650.68s]  You don't blame me for that.
[3650.68s -> 3653.16s]  It's a gassy food.
[3653.16s -> 3654.72s]  You ate eggs, you ate eggs.
[3654.72s -> 3655.60s]  Eggs are gassy.
[3655.60s -> 3662.09s]  It's a gassy food.
[3662.09s -> 3664.65s]  Oh, by the way, I never said you have to make this recipe.
[3664.65s -> 3666.05s]  I just said if you're ever gonna make egg salad,
[3666.05s -> 3667.23s]  you could try it if you feel like it.
[3667.23s -> 3669.85s]  You don't have to.
[3669.85s -> 3674.99s]  It's delicious to me and my family, okay?
[3674.99s -> 3680.26s]  My family.
[3680.26s -> 3682.56s]  Okay, peering, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go in the hut.
[3682.56s -> 3683.62s]  You push open the door.
[3683.62s -> 3693.00s]  The boy jumps to his feet, grabbing at a crooked stick.
[3693.04s -> 3694.40s]  Who are you?
[3694.40s -> 3697.04s]  The boy demands the stick in his hand is solid oak
[3697.04s -> 3700.37s]  and raised, ready to swing for your head.
[3700.37s -> 3702.86s]  What do you want with me?
[3702.86s -> 3705.34s]  Put that stick down before I beat you with it.
[3705.34s -> 3706.94s]  I mean you no harm.
[3706.94s -> 3711.42s]  Who are you?
[3711.42s -> 3717.43s]  Um, how about who are you?
[3717.43s -> 3721.57s]  Just a shepherd, he replies, stick wavering in his hand.
[3721.57s -> 3723.66s]  Who are you?
[3723.66s -> 3724.91s]  I am a traveler.
[3724.91s -> 3727.29s]  I am a great and powerful sorcerer.
[3727.29s -> 3730.90s]  I'm a friend.
[3730.90s -> 3734.64s]  I'm a, I don't wanna,
[3734.64s -> 3737.95s]  I don't tell anybody any of this stuff.
[3737.95s -> 3740.15s]  I'm a traveler.
[3740.15s -> 3742.15s]  I'm a traveler.
[3742.15s -> 3744.35s]  These plains are wild and empty.
[3744.35s -> 3746.62s]  You must be tired.
[3746.62s -> 3749.86s]  Please, come and share the fireside.
[3749.86s -> 3753.14s]  It's all I have, but you're welcome to it.
[3753.14s -> 3758.62s]  He proposes stick by the hearth and gestures in welcome.
[3758.62s -> 3760.18s]  It is not much.
[3760.18s -> 3761.33s]  Thank you.
[3761.33s -> 3766.67s]  You live out here?
[3766.67s -> 3768.84s]  Thank you.
[3768.84s -> 3771.40s]  You nod to the boy and take a seat beside him.
[3771.40s -> 3773.40s]  The peaceful atmosphere and gentle warmth
[3773.40s -> 3777.70s]  is most restorative.
[3777.70s -> 3779.26s]  Where are you from?
[3779.26s -> 3781.07s]  Do you plate ice?
[3781.07s -> 3783.12s]  Have you heard of the seven serpents?
[3783.12s -> 3789.51s]  I'm on my way to Manpang.
[3789.51s -> 3791.38s]  Do you play dice?
[3791.38s -> 3794.33s]  You ask, reaching into your pack for your stones.
[3794.33s -> 3796.43s]  The boy shakes his head sharply.
[3796.43s -> 3799.11s]  My father plays dice with my mother
[3799.11s -> 3801.25s]  and it does nothing but make them argue.
[3801.25s -> 3802.97s]  I don't touch those things.
[3802.97s -> 3803.81s]  You put the dice away.
[3803.81s -> 3806.49s]  Ah, okay, whatever, kid, fine.
[3806.49s -> 3810.56s]  I was gonna put 20 gold on the table, but you know, whatever.
[3810.56s -> 3813.24s]  Where are you from?
[3813.24s -> 3817.60s]  Karima, in the foot of the mountains near the long bridge.
[3817.60s -> 3819.92s]  The boy lifts his crook once more,
[3819.92s -> 3823.51s]  but uses it only to poke at the fire.
[3823.51s -> 3824.67s]  Near the long bridge, okay.
[3824.83s -> 3832.80s]  Wait, what's it doing here?
[3832.80s -> 3834.92s]  What can you tell me about the towers?
[3834.92s -> 3836.30s]  The beacons?
[3836.30s -> 3839.05s]  They were built by sorcerers, of course.
[3839.05s -> 3841.21s]  I'm not sure what they're for,
[3841.21s -> 3845.07s]  but they're meant to keep us safe.
[3845.07s -> 3846.75s]  Safe from what?
[3846.75s -> 3847.83s]  I don't know.
[3847.83s -> 3852.12s]  My mother says rock falls, but I don't understand that.
[3852.12s -> 3855.02s]  Where would all the rocks fall from?
[3855.02s -> 3856.62s]  But the archmage can see the future,
[3856.62s -> 3860.43s]  so I'm sure what he did was for the best.
[3860.43s -> 3863.30s]  I can also see the future.
[3863.30s -> 3864.90s]  You tell the boy, you nod.
[3864.90s -> 3867.13s]  Would you like to see yours?
[3867.13s -> 3868.73s]  The boy nods nervously.
[3869.57s -> 3874.86s]  Wait, I don't have the thing.
[3874.86s -> 3878.50s]  I don't actually have the crystal, right?
[3878.50s -> 3880.17s]  What can I do?
[3880.17s -> 3881.93s]  Would you like to see your future?
[3889.14s -> 3892.99s]  Just cause slowness.
[3892.99s -> 3898.12s]  Open locks and doors?
[3898.12s -> 3903.30s]  Cause sleepiness?
[3903.30s -> 3905.83s]  Oh, I can read his mind.
[3905.83s -> 3913.95s]  Tell sap.
[3913.95s -> 3914.99s]  Oh, that's awful.
[3914.99s -> 3917.91s]  Cause depression?
[3917.91s -> 3919.23s]  That's so evil.
[3920.76s -> 3928.26s]  That's so evil.
[3928.74s -> 3932.91s]  I could, but I can't.
[3932.91s -> 3934.55s]  Just freak him out.
[3934.55s -> 3935.75s]  Would you like to see your future?
[3935.75s -> 3938.39s]  And then touch the kid's hand,
[3938.39s -> 3941.23s]  and like, oh, I'm doing, oh, I'm floating.
[3941.23s -> 3942.35s]  What did you do?
[3942.35s -> 3946.16s]  Oh, you must be a sorcerer.
[3946.16s -> 3947.84s]  And the kid gets wicked excited,
[3947.84s -> 3950.32s]  and is like, yeah, I did that, yeah.
[3950.32s -> 3952.60s]  Oh my God, you're a sorcerer.
[3952.60s -> 3954.04s]  Oh, ah.
[3954.04s -> 3954.88s]  And you fall down.
[3954.88s -> 3956.04s]  Oh, you got me.
[3956.04s -> 3966.90s]  Like we're playing, yeah, that's perfect.
[3966.90s -> 3967.94s]  Don't ruin his life.
[3967.94s -> 3973.67s]  No, I'm gonna read his mind and then say what he says.
[3973.67s -> 3975.27s]  Okay, drawing the skull cap from your pack,
[3975.27s -> 3976.55s]  you cast the spell.
[3976.55s -> 3978.19s]  In his thoughts, you hear the prophecy
[3978.19s -> 3980.62s]  he is expecting to hear.
[3980.62s -> 3983.38s]  The same as that of Elthira,
[3983.38s -> 3987.35s]  of a desert wilderness and the death of all the land.
[3987.35s -> 3988.79s]  You take off the skull cap once more.
[3988.79s -> 3994.36s]  The boy watches you expectantly.
[3994.36s -> 3996.12s]  I see you as an old man with seven children.
[3996.12s -> 3998.96s]  I see you as a great warrior fighting the giants.
[3998.96s -> 4002.33s]  Or tell the truth.
[4002.33s -> 4003.97s]  I feel like this is game progress.
[4003.97s -> 4012.18s]  This is, laugh out loud, it ends here and I leave.
[4012.18s -> 4016.70s]  I see this land as a pale and empty desert.
[4016.70s -> 4018.94s]  You do not need to lie to know the future
[4018.94s -> 4021.26s]  of this place after all.
[4021.26s -> 4023.59s]  That's what Elthira saw as well.
[4023.59s -> 4025.27s]  The whole land and the marsh between the mountains,
[4025.27s -> 4030.16s]  a forest and the bridge to Iqlala destroyed.
[4030.16s -> 4032.32s]  Seems he does not feel like talking further,
[4032.32s -> 4034.58s]  but turns to stare away into the fire.
[4034.58s -> 4043.98s]  You bid him farewell and leave the hut.
[4043.98s -> 4049.10s]  You should have sapped him.
[4049.10s -> 4052.26s]  You still caused depression after all.
[4052.42s -> 4058.87s]  I didn't mean, whatever.
[4058.87s -> 4061.39s]  As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.
[4061.39s -> 4064.91s]  You walk through wide fields, thick with crops.
[4064.91s -> 4068.31s]  A few goats graze on low hillocks on the land,
[4068.31s -> 4070.29s]  watching you with beady eyes.
[4070.29s -> 4072.17s]  This place seems to be rich,
[4072.17s -> 4074.92s]  far richer than the villages west of Kare.
[4074.92s -> 4077.16s]  Seems impossible that it could ever become a place
[4077.16s -> 4080.41s]  as desolate as the backland.
[4080.41s -> 4082.18s]  Looking south, you see the tower.
[4082.18s -> 4083.10s]  Further on in that direction,
[4083.10s -> 4085.66s]  a river rushes through the plains.
[4085.66s -> 4088.71s]  You stride on through the long swishing grass.
[4088.71s -> 4092.57s]  Then from somewhere close at hand, you hear a voice.
[4092.57s -> 4096.13s]  Someone there, you got any water?
[4096.13s -> 4099.45s]  Have you?
[4099.45s -> 4110.76s]  Turns out, Yaz caused invisibility.
[4110.76s -> 4114.73s]  Is that all I could do?
[4114.73s -> 4119.27s]  Jig is available.
[4119.27s -> 4122.53s]  Hell is available too.
[4122.53s -> 4134.25s]  I could do sus.
[4134.25s -> 4145.78s]  Jig, Jig always works.
[4145.78s -> 4149.86s]  I tried to make your eggs and I got divorced.
[4149.86s -> 4152.97s]  I feel like there's a lot more going on
[4152.97s -> 4155.84s]  than simply you made egg salad.
[4155.84s -> 4160.75s]  I'm sorry, I don't have very much advice for you.
[4160.75s -> 4166.26s]  All right, let's do Jig.
[4166.26s -> 4167.62s]  Reaching up to the constellations above,
[4167.62s -> 4169.70s]  you create the spell.
[4169.70s -> 4172.30s]  Pulling out your bamboo flute and starting to play,
[4172.30s -> 4174.66s]  you soon begin to hear an exhausting popping sound
[4174.66s -> 4176.98s]  from somewhere in the grass.
[4178.74s -> 4180.46s]  Follow the sound.
[4180.46s -> 4183.54s]  The sound turns into a series of wet clicks,
[4183.54s -> 4185.94s]  which you follow until you all but stumble over a head
[4185.94s -> 4189.24s]  planted in the soil like a cabbage.
[4189.24s -> 4192.08s]  It is maniacally rolling from side to side
[4192.08s -> 4203.16s]  and flaring its nostrils as it tries to dance.
[4203.16s -> 4205.64s]  You keep playing until the spell finally fades.
[4205.64s -> 4207.56s]  The head in the ground is now quite exhausted
[4207.56s -> 4211.24s]  and looks almost ready to fall asleep.
[4211.24s -> 4212.51s]  Wake it up.
[4212.51s -> 4216.14s]  You squat down and greet the head, its eyes open wide.
[4216.14s -> 4219.77s]  Greetings, do you have any water?
[4219.77s -> 4226.74s]  I'm dying of thirst after all that dancing.
[4226.74s -> 4229.54s]  What are you?
[4229.54s -> 4231.62s]  What are you doing down there?
[4231.62s -> 4237.07s]  I'll get you some water.
[4237.07s -> 4238.67s]  You peer down at the head.
[4238.67s -> 4242.83s]  It is a man's, if an animate decapitated head
[4242.83s -> 4244.35s]  can have a gender.
[4244.35s -> 4248.39s]  He has shaggy hair, brown eyes and parched lips.
[4248.39s -> 4251.31s]  He's not shaved for some time.
[4251.31s -> 4254.52s]  No need to stare or stare all you like,
[4254.52s -> 4260.66s]  but give me some water.
[4260.66s -> 4262.99s]  What are you doing down there?
[4262.99s -> 4264.27s]  The head wiggles its eyebrows,
[4264.27s -> 4266.44s]  perhaps the equivalent of a shrug.
[4266.44s -> 4268.46s]  Still one too many goats.
[4268.46s -> 4269.66s]  Ishtar is a great place,
[4269.66s -> 4272.46s]  but they don't take well to goat stealing.
[4272.46s -> 4274.62s]  It gets their goat, as they say,
[4274.62s -> 4278.61s]  gets their back right up.
[4278.61s -> 4280.38s]  So you're a criminal.
[4280.38s -> 4281.96s]  You are surprised.
[4281.96s -> 4285.06s]  I was, but I'm reformed now.
[4285.06s -> 4288.26s]  Not that it does much good, of course.
[4288.26s -> 4293.19s]  It's too late for your soul.
[4293.19s -> 4298.63s]  It's too late for your soul.
[4298.63s -> 4305.30s]  Uh, reformed how?
[4306.26s -> 4307.72s]  You've been punished then.
[4307.72s -> 4308.92s]  Well, I didn't bury myself down here.
[4308.92s -> 4312.57s]  Did I?
[4312.57s -> 4321.37s]  Listen, give me any water or don't you?
[4323.37s -> 4325.67s]  Give him poison.
[4325.67s -> 4326.95s]  Give some poison.
[4339.55s -> 4341.97s]  I could have just put stuff,
[4341.97s -> 4344.61s]  a grenade in the hole with him and then pull it and run.
[4344.61s -> 4345.73s]  What the fuck?
[4345.73s -> 4348.26s]  I don't have a pebble.
[4348.26s -> 4352.23s]  Are you kidding me?
[4352.23s -> 4353.27s]  Cause quicksand?
[4353.27s -> 4355.67s]  What am I gonna like pour quicksand in his mouth
[4355.67s -> 4356.49s]  or something?
[4356.49s -> 4361.03s]  What the hell?
[4361.03s -> 4365.89s]  Should I read his mind?
[4365.89s -> 4366.85s]  I don't have the items for it.
[4366.85s -> 4368.62s]  I would have thrown a grenade at him.
[4369.26s -> 4376.30s]  I don't have the item.
[4376.30s -> 4383.26s]  Let's do the tried and true sus.
[4383.26s -> 4385.38s]  You spin the constellations into the shape around you
[4385.38s -> 4387.66s]  and a steady voice begins to speak to you.
[4387.66s -> 4390.78s]  It informs you that the head is of no danger
[4390.78s -> 4394.12s]  and can only be helped and be helpful.
[4394.12s -> 4397.21s]  Reassured you wait for the spell to fade once more.
[4397.21s -> 4399.81s]  Please, I'm really thirsty.
[4407.65s -> 4408.65s]  Why would I poison now?
[4408.65s -> 4413.37s]  Sus just told me that he's helpful.
[4413.37s -> 4422.01s]  I'll go get some water.
[4422.01s -> 4423.17s]  Do tell?
[4423.17s -> 4426.33s]  Well, sus can always be trusted.
[4426.33s -> 4429.21s]  No danger and can only be helped and be helpful.
[4429.21s -> 4434.83s]  So, sus usually doesn't lead us wrong.
[4434.83s -> 4436.98s]  I can get you some.
[4436.98s -> 4441.89s]  The head cracks like a tapped egg into a smile.
[4441.89s -> 4443.37s]  Bless you, stranger.
[4443.37s -> 4445.17s]  You've got a good soul.
[4445.17s -> 4447.64s]  Well, good souls.
[4447.64s -> 4451.63s]  What do I get in return?
[4451.63s -> 4453.07s]  The head wiggles its eyebrows.
[4453.07s -> 4461.12s]  All right, I'm not sure what I can do for you.
[4461.12s -> 4464.54s]  Have you heard of the seven serpents?
[4464.54s -> 4469.03s]  I want to lie and say yes, but I won't.
[4469.03s -> 4471.02s]  I've never heard of any serpents
[4471.02s -> 4472.70s]  and seven sounds like a lot.
[4476.09s -> 4478.54s]  What do you know about this place?
[4478.54s -> 4479.81s]  What, this place?
[4479.81s -> 4481.77s]  It's a punishment field.
[4481.77s -> 4485.02s]  I have no idea how many other unfortunates are here.
[4485.02s -> 4486.50s]  You can't even see them.
[4486.50s -> 4490.19s]  And they're quickly learned to be quiet.
[4490.19s -> 4492.49s]  Why are they quiet?
[4492.49s -> 4494.62s]  Sound attracts animals.
[4494.62s -> 4497.49s]  Lynch bugs, badu beetles, harpies.
[4497.49s -> 4500.20s]  Not like we can defend ourselves.
[4500.20s -> 4502.22s]  The head smiles thinly.
[4502.22s -> 4503.42s]  Look, I can't keep talking.
[4503.42s -> 4508.04s]  I'll die of thirst.
[4508.04s -> 4510.74s]  I don't know what you are.
[4510.74s -> 4513.71s]  I thought I told you I'm a thief, but they caught me.
[4513.71s -> 4518.17s]  The head's eye twitches as though itching.
[4518.21s -> 4520.56s]  Scratch the head's forehead.
[4520.56s -> 4524.36s]  You kneel down and scratch the head above its left eye.
[4524.36s -> 4527.38s]  It lets out a gasp of approval, murmuring.
[4527.38s -> 4530.45s]  You have no idea how that feels, stranger.
[4530.45s -> 4533.61s]  The head mumbles something, but keeps its lips closed.
[4533.61s -> 4537.41s]  It clearly isn't going to speak any further.
[4537.41s -> 4541.68s]  Just dig up the head?
[4541.68s -> 4546.58s]  All right, go get water or dig up the head.
[4546.58s -> 4554.70s]  Let's get a poll.
[4554.70s -> 4556.57s]  This is just one or two.
[4556.57s -> 4559.22s]  One, two, one, two.
[4559.22s -> 4560.62s]  Are we going to, I'll get you water
[4560.62s -> 4565.34s]  or are we gonna dig up the head?
[4565.34s -> 4574.56s]  Water, he's gonna die.
[4574.56s -> 4577.40s]  Wouldn't it be quicker if I dug up the head
[4577.40s -> 4588.60s]  and then he, well, maybe he can't really move.
[4588.60s -> 4594.10s]  Kick his head like a football, oh my God, dude.
[4594.10s -> 4595.44s]  All right, we're going one.
[4595.44s -> 4598.20s]  I'll get you that water.
[4598.20s -> 4601.85s]  Not like I'm going anywhere.
[4601.85s -> 4604.96s]  All right, so we gotta remember that this is where,
[4604.96s -> 4609.60s]  right here is where that head is.
[4609.60s -> 4611.00s]  So keep that in mind.
[4611.00s -> 4613.52s]  I won't remember, so you guys have to.
[4613.52s -> 4617.62s]  All right, let's head up here.
[4617.62s -> 4620.26s]  You make your slow way across the fertile prairie,
[4620.26s -> 4622.77s]  enjoying the soft chirping of the insects.
[4622.77s -> 4625.72s]  The sun continues to climb the steep sky.
[4625.72s -> 4630.34s]  Nearby, you hear the sound of hammers on stone.
[4630.34s -> 4632.86s]  You approach the sound to find a group of workmen
[4632.86s -> 4634.64s]  erecting a scaffold.
[4634.64s -> 4636.76s]  They ignore your approach.
[4636.76s -> 4638.10s]  As you approach the scaffold,
[4638.10s -> 4642.70s]  you are stopped by a large spin wearing a metal helmet.
[4642.70s -> 4649.74s]  Stay back, big rocks high up.
[4649.74s -> 4652.80s]  What are you building?
[4652.80s -> 4654.74s]  This seventh beacon.
[4654.74s -> 4658.80s]  This one prevent collapsing in the cloud mountains.
[4658.80s -> 4661.88s]  Also make weather nice.
[4661.88s -> 4663.22s]  He turns to glance over his shoulder
[4663.22s -> 4665.64s]  and shout incomprehensible insults
[4665.64s -> 4667.28s]  at a group of worker spins
[4667.28s -> 4674.07s]  who are clamoring about in the upper reaches of the frame.
[4674.07s -> 4678.04s]  Uh, I need to cross the mountains to the east.
[4678.04s -> 4679.56s]  You tell him.
[4679.56s -> 4683.15s]  He's the bridge we built for this.
[4683.15s -> 4685.13s]  The scaffold sits in a deep pit in the ground,
[4685.13s -> 4687.92s]  which is being used to hold foundations.
[4687.92s -> 4692.25s]  How does this beacon prevent avalanches?
[4692.25s -> 4693.89s]  Magic is magic.
[4693.89s -> 4698.26s]  We know this high, this wide, this strong,
[4698.26s -> 4701.38s]  strong enough to hold olephant.
[4701.38s -> 4703.76s]  The rest is them problem.
[4703.76s -> 4710.60s]  He jerks a thumb in a general eastward direction.
[4711.32s -> 4713.06s]  Who's problem?
[4713.06s -> 4716.32s]  He jerks his clawed thumb eastwards again,
[4716.32s -> 4719.76s]  but seems reluctant to say any more than that.
[4719.76s -> 4721.44s]  There's a crash from the site
[4721.44s -> 4723.12s]  and the spin turns around and roars
[4723.12s -> 4726.57s]  stomping back toward the construction.
[4726.57s -> 4727.97s]  Follow.
[4727.97s -> 4729.64s]  You follow him curiously
[4729.64s -> 4731.52s]  and see that one of the bamboo supports
[4731.52s -> 4734.44s]  has bent and buckled under the weight of two spins
[4734.44s -> 4736.44s]  who are now clinging on like spider monkeys
[4736.44s -> 4737.90s]  above the pit below.
[4737.90s -> 4739.82s]  The spin to whom you were talking to
[4739.82s -> 4740.94s]  is scratching his belly
[4740.94s -> 4746.22s]  and trying to work out what to do.
[4746.74s -> 4752.37s]  Wait and see what he does or help them.
[4752.37s -> 4759.48s]  I think he's just gonna let them die.
[4759.48s -> 4762.23s]  Help them.
[4762.23s -> 4764.71s]  You step forward intending to assist,
[4764.71s -> 4767.68s]  then realize you do not know what to do.
[4767.68s -> 4769.40s]  The two creatures are some height up
[4769.40s -> 4772.06s]  and swaying violently back and forth.
[4772.06s -> 4779.28s]  The leader is scratching his chin, clearly thinking hard.
[4779.28s -> 4780.72s]  You open your eyes to begin a spell,
[4780.72s -> 4783.36s]  but the spin knocks your hands down on reflex.
[4783.36s -> 4787.61s]  None that, we engineers.
[4787.61s -> 4790.93s]  Okay, with that, he goes over to the edge of the pit
[4791.05s -> 4794.13s]  and collects two unused bamboo rods
[4794.13s -> 4796.48s]  and lays them down across the pit.
[4796.48s -> 4798.12s]  He then gathers another two
[4798.12s -> 4800.88s]  and you quickly realize he's building a support framework
[4800.88s -> 4806.68s]  to allow the stranded spins to climb down.
[4806.68s -> 4808.68s]  You take advantage of this distraction
[4808.68s -> 4810.45s]  to walk around the site
[4810.45s -> 4813.47s]  and poke into the materials they have in their stores.
[4813.47s -> 4815.27s]  It's mostly as you might expect.
[4815.27s -> 4817.39s]  Bamboo, hardwood for cutting joists
[4817.39s -> 4820.08s]  and various hammers, chisels and lathes.
[4820.08s -> 4823.94s]  If there is to be stonework, that must be arriving later.
[4823.98s -> 4826.86s]  Behind everything is a small metal box
[4826.86s -> 4834.96s]  with a catch on the lid and a gourd of water.
[4834.96s -> 4836.05s]  Take the gourd.
[4836.05s -> 4840.29s]  You take the gourd and test the water inside.
[4840.29s -> 4841.89s]  It seems fresh enough.
[4841.89s -> 4844.55s]  It is presumably belonging to one of the workmen.
[4844.55s -> 4845.51s]  You put it in your pack,
[4845.51s -> 4849.69s]  remembering the parched head in the fields to the east.
[4849.69s -> 4851.33s]  You squat down and open the box
[4851.33s -> 4855.32s]  to reveal a small blue crystal that is currently dark,
[4855.32s -> 4856.70s]  but looks very similar to the ones
[4856.70s -> 4860.85s]  you have seen previously on the tower.
[4860.85s -> 4863.41s]  Hold on a second.
[4863.41s -> 4869.48s]  They're building another tower.
[4869.48s -> 4878.38s]  So in the present, this would be a tower.
[4878.38s -> 4880.62s]  Should I let them just continue to build it?
[4880.62s -> 4889.53s]  Or should I take it and then put the gem in later?
[4889.53s -> 4890.73s]  You see what I'm saying?
[4890.73s -> 4895.27s]  Because that's the blue crystal that activates the towers.
[4895.27s -> 4899.61s]  I think I'm just gonna leave it.
[4899.61s -> 4901.29s]  I hope this is correct.
[4901.29s -> 4906.46s]  I don't think they'll, they won't build it.
[4906.46s -> 4909.28s]  Yeah, I'm gonna leave it.
[4909.28s -> 4912.25s]  Yeah, why would they finish it without the gem?
[4912.25s -> 4913.77s]  Stop this tower from being built.
[4913.77s -> 4915.62s]  Fuck the timeline over.
[4915.62s -> 4916.46s]  I'm gonna leave it.
[4916.46s -> 4918.22s]  I feel like that's a bad idea.
[4918.22s -> 4919.60s]  You flip the box closed once more.
[4919.60s -> 4920.44s]  Whatever the jewel is,
[4920.44s -> 4922.72s]  it's presumably important to the builders.
[4922.72s -> 4924.78s]  The rest of the materials on the site are uninteresting,
[4924.78s -> 4927.53s]  except for a sharp, edged hewing ax.
[4927.53s -> 4930.45s]  Ooh, I'll take that.
[4930.45s -> 4932.61s]  You pick it up and quietly slip it into your pack.
[4932.61s -> 4934.23s]  It's time to go.
[4934.23s -> 4938.34s]  You move on, leaving the workers to their task.
[4938.34s -> 4940.44s]  All right, let's do this.
[4940.44s -> 4945.20s]  Let's give the water.
[4945.20s -> 4946.48s]  It is hot now.
[4946.48s -> 4948.68s]  You are starting to sweat under your cloak.
[4948.68s -> 4952.33s]  You walk back through the long, lush fields.
[4952.33s -> 4953.76s]  You look for the head.
[4953.76s -> 4955.77s]  Are you there?
[4955.77s -> 4957.68s]  Down here.
[4957.68s -> 4959.48s]  You find it in the grass.
[4959.48s -> 4960.86s]  Did you bring water?
[4960.86s -> 4964.28s]  Please say you did.
[4964.28s -> 4967.26s]  Give water to the head.
[4967.26s -> 4969.86s]  You open your pack and take out the water gourd.
[4969.86s -> 4971.84s]  The head follows your every movement
[4971.84s -> 4974.11s]  with insatiable curiosity.
[4974.11s -> 4977.60s]  Then it throws back its upper jaw in excitement.
[4977.60s -> 4980.10s]  You squat down and pour the water into its mouth.
[4980.10s -> 4983.26s]  It coughs and splutters, drinking to clear its mouth,
[4983.26s -> 4985.37s]  but not wanting to stop.
[4985.37s -> 4986.95s]  Wonderful.
[4986.95s -> 4989.30s]  You have no idea how wonderful.
[4989.30s -> 4993.59s]  That'll keep me going another day, at least.
[4993.59s -> 4996.24s]  Dig up the head.
[4996.24s -> 4999.96s]  I'll get you out of there, you declare.
[4999.96s -> 5002.31s]  That would be a great idea.
[5002.31s -> 5005.95s]  I'd be more grateful than you can imagine.
[5005.95s -> 5010.69s]  Grab him by the head and pull.
[5010.69s -> 5014.27s]  Just grab him by the skull and just lift.
[5014.27s -> 5021.84s]  What can I do here?
[5021.84s -> 5024.97s]  Oh no, that's a bad idea.
[5033.84s -> 5035.58s]  Protect from magic?
[5035.58s -> 5039.98s]  What if there's a, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5039.98s -> 5041.64s]  Is it possible that there's a spell here
[5041.64s -> 5043.24s]  where if he gets out,
[5043.24s -> 5045.08s]  it just is gonna explode or something?
[5045.08s -> 5045.92s]  Like a saw trap?
[5056.51s -> 5060.26s]  Maybe I should do magic defense.
[5060.26s -> 5064.36s]  We could do big, we could do six.
[5064.36s -> 5067.20s]  I don't, oh, I could teleport him out of the hole.
[5067.20s -> 5069.18s]  That's funny.
[5069.22s -> 5070.52s]  It's dirt, just dig.
[5070.52s -> 5071.36s]  We'll do six.
[5071.36s -> 5073.26s]  Six, oh look, if it explodes, it kills one of the clones.
[5073.26s -> 5076.84s]  Whatever, I don't care.
[5076.84s -> 5078.36s]  Five clones step out from behind you,
[5078.36s -> 5079.88s]  forming a semi-circle.
[5079.88s -> 5081.98s]  Dig up the head.
[5081.98s -> 5084.70s]  Working together, you dig the head out of the ground
[5084.70s -> 5085.70s]  in no time.
[5085.70s -> 5087.18s]  To find he is in fact a man
[5087.18s -> 5090.22s]  buried up to his neck in the ground.
[5090.22s -> 5095.49s]  Blessed throth, I can hardly believe it.
[5095.49s -> 5099.56s]  Turning to you, he lowers his eyes in solemn acknowledgement.
[5099.56s -> 5101.45s]  I am quite clear.
[5101.45s -> 5104.00s]  I owe you my life.
[5104.00s -> 5107.48s]  I will repay the debt any way that I can,
[5107.48s -> 5109.74s]  though I have little to offer.
[5109.74s -> 5111.62s]  One by one, your clones vanish.
[5111.62s -> 5114.12s]  He pats down his pockets.
[5114.12s -> 5116.90s]  I have nothing to offer you.
[5116.90s -> 5118.17s]  Search him.
[5118.17s -> 5119.73s]  Grabbing his arm, you quickly search him
[5119.73s -> 5121.28s]  to establish the truth.
[5121.28s -> 5122.52s]  Sure enough, in one pocket,
[5122.52s -> 5125.41s]  you uncover a fine pearl ring.
[5125.41s -> 5127.77s]  He shrugs, giving a half smile,
[5127.77s -> 5129.93s]  but lets you take it.
[5129.93s -> 5132.04s]  Your search is done, you step back.
[5132.04s -> 5133.91s]  He nods.
[5133.91s -> 5137.32s]  And so, we are quits.
[5137.32s -> 5138.85s]  Be well.
[5138.85s -> 5140.13s]  Then with a flamboyant wave,
[5140.13s -> 5143.32s]  he takes off across the field at a run.
[5143.32s -> 5145.60s]  After a few paces, he seems to trip on something,
[5145.60s -> 5146.96s]  but quickly gets up,
[5146.96s -> 5149.60s]  apologizes to something you cannot see,
[5149.60s -> 5154.70s]  and is gone into the mists of the backlands.
[5156.52s -> 5160.00s]  What a wacky dude.
[5160.00s -> 5161.95s]  There's another head.
[5161.95s -> 5167.47s]  Pearl ring, I think that actually is a big deal.
[5167.47s -> 5168.31s]  Hold on.
[5168.31s -> 5183.95s]  Something needs a pearl ring, doesn't it?
[5183.95s -> 5186.08s]  Yaz.
[5186.08s -> 5188.48s]  Oh, I can go invisible now.
[5188.48s -> 5193.28s]  It is Yaz.
[5193.28s -> 5194.90s]  Casting the spell while wearing a pearl ring
[5194.90s -> 5196.32s]  will render the caster invisible
[5196.32s -> 5199.16s]  to any reasonably intelligent creature.
[5199.16s -> 5200.38s]  Less intelligent creatures
[5200.38s -> 5202.98s]  will only be partially convinced,
[5202.98s -> 5205.26s]  and creatures with ears will still be able
[5205.26s -> 5208.02s]  to hear the caster when they move.
[5208.02s -> 5218.22s]  Okay, so it works less on low intelligence.
[5218.22s -> 5219.18s]  Yaz.
[5219.18s -> 5220.02s]  Yaz.
[5220.02s -> 5221.99s]  Slay.
[5221.99s -> 5226.45s]  Yaz.
[5226.45s -> 5227.29s]  Cool.
[5227.29s -> 5229.60s]  Okay.
[5229.60s -> 5233.34s]  So we know what's up this way.
[5233.34s -> 5234.84s]  I was gonna wrap around.
[5234.84s -> 5237.03s]  So we're gonna wrap around here.
[5237.03s -> 5242.38s]  I'm gonna go this way.
[5242.38s -> 5244.78s]  You carry on traveling across the lush grassland,
[5244.78s -> 5246.79s]  long grass brushing your boots.
[5246.79s -> 5249.84s]  Heat beats down from an empty sky.
[5249.84s -> 5252.61s]  A clatter of wheels makes you turn your head.
[5252.61s -> 5253.81s]  A cart is approaching,
[5253.81s -> 5257.60s]  driven by a broad figure in a long cloak.
[5257.60s -> 5263.22s]  Greet the figure, step aside, duck out of sight.
[5263.22s -> 5265.95s]  Should I just do the Red Dead Redemption 2 thing?
[5265.95s -> 5267.50s]  Hey, stranger.
[5267.50s -> 5269.22s]  Hey, hold on now.
[5269.22s -> 5271.03s]  Eh, fuck you.
[5271.03s -> 5273.20s]  You're a piece of shit.
[5273.20s -> 5275.04s]  You're an asshole.
[5275.04s -> 5277.09s]  What's wrong with you?
[5277.09s -> 5285.08s]  Don't want it.
[5285.08s -> 5288.54s]  I'm only kidding with you.
[5288.54s -> 5292.08s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[5292.08s -> 5293.46s]  Piece of work.
[5293.46s -> 5294.77s]  Moron.
[5294.77s -> 5296.62s]  Idiot.
[5296.62s -> 5297.44s]  Hey.
[5297.44s -> 5302.16s]  No, I'm kidding.
[5302.16s -> 5305.86s]  Let's greet.
[5305.86s -> 5308.18s]  You step into the cart's path and raise a hand.
[5308.22s -> 5312.23s]  The figure raises a fist in return.
[5312.23s -> 5316.60s]  Stranger, do you want blood?
[5316.60s -> 5317.81s]  Stay back.
[5317.81s -> 5320.57s]  What manner of creature are you?
[5320.57s -> 5322.82s]  What manner of blood?
[5322.82s -> 5324.24s]  What are the response?
[5324.24s -> 5326.44s]  What manner of blood?
[5326.44s -> 5328.04s]  You call.
[5328.04s -> 5330.38s]  The cart driver booms a cheerful laugh.
[5330.38s -> 5332.82s]  All kinds.
[5332.82s -> 5336.69s]  She throws her hood and waves towards the back of the cart.
[5336.69s -> 5340.98s]  I am the butcher of Badubak, stake of olephant,
[5340.98s -> 5344.86s]  blue hide of snatacat, ribs of goats.
[5344.86s -> 5346.95s]  Your stomach rumbles at the thought.
[5346.95s -> 5350.49s]  What do you fancy?
[5350.49s -> 5352.65s]  The driver gestures with a brandish cleaver
[5352.65s -> 5353.93s]  to the back of her cart,
[5353.93s -> 5361.66s]  from which a thin river of blood trickles.
[5361.66s -> 5363.34s]  Okay.
[5364.54s -> 5370.34s]  I think I can buy food.
[5370.34s -> 5372.11s]  What do you recommend?
[5372.11s -> 5374.28s]  She considers that for a moment.
[5374.28s -> 5377.34s]  The snatacat meat is the rarest, of course.
[5377.34s -> 5380.04s]  And if you've never tried invisible steak,
[5380.04s -> 5383.64s]  then you should, just for the experience.
[5383.64s -> 5386.86s]  It disappears from sight the more you eat it.
[5386.86s -> 5394.73s]  But bah, olephant tastes the best.
[5394.73s -> 5395.85s]  I have a lot of money.
[5397.50s -> 5398.34s]  Let's buy something.
[5398.34s -> 5399.65s]  I'll buy something from you.
[5399.65s -> 5401.11s]  She beams with pleasure.
[5401.11s -> 5402.96s]  What'll it be?
[5402.96s -> 5405.20s]  The olephant steak is seven pieces,
[5405.20s -> 5407.12s]  blue hide is 10.
[5407.12s -> 5409.60s]  The steaks are bloody and raw
[5409.60s -> 5417.67s]  and will be no good without cooking.
[5417.67s -> 5419.97s]  That's a lot.
[5419.97s -> 5429.26s]  That's like all my money.
[5429.26s -> 5431.28s]  That's too much.
[5431.28s -> 5433.83s]  The butcher nods sadly.
[5433.83s -> 5435.29s]  Then I wish you well, traveler,
[5435.29s -> 5446.72s]  but I am no charity.
[5446.72s -> 5449.55s]  Oh, wait, oh no.
[5449.55s -> 5453.40s]  Zap, the cart.
[5453.40s -> 5457.44s]  Wait, oh yeah, I'm just gonna go invisible.
[5457.44s -> 5458.40s]  She'll just drive by.
[5458.40s -> 5459.68s]  Yap, talk with animals.
[5459.68s -> 5461.16s]  Wait, there's something in the back?
[5461.16s -> 5462.98s]  Alive?
[5462.98s -> 5471.04s]  Is something in the back of this alive an animal alive?
[5471.04s -> 5476.64s]  Talk with animals?
[5476.64s -> 5477.68s]  Pulling up the green wig,
[5477.68s -> 5479.00s]  you put it on and cast the spell,
[5479.00s -> 5480.40s]  but the spell only works on animals.
[5480.40s -> 5481.86s]  So there's no effect other than the butcher
[5481.86s -> 5483.82s]  looking at you in surprise.
[5483.82s -> 5485.46s]  Is that supposed to distract me?
[5485.46s -> 5486.30s]  It won't work.
[5486.30s -> 5488.73s]  Oh shit, it's raw meat.
[5488.73s -> 5491.57s]  Oh no, wait, go back, go back, go back.
[5491.57s -> 5497.29s]  Rewind, I wanna rewind.
[5497.29s -> 5499.55s]  Trying to talk to raw meat.
[5499.55s -> 5502.54s]  I don't know if there was a, I don't know.
[5502.54s -> 5508.02s]  No, I'm going back.
[5508.02s -> 5509.28s]  Okay, cool, what do you recommend?
[5513.98s -> 5516.27s]  Yeah, that's too much.
[5516.27s -> 5527.27s]  Okay, what else can I do?
[5527.27s -> 5531.13s]  God, oh, I could pretend to be God.
[5531.13s -> 5536.23s]  Jig, I wonder how well Jig would work here.
[5536.23s -> 5541.36s]  Law, she's, okay, a non-intelligent creature.
[5541.36s -> 5543.42s]  That's not gonna work.
[5543.42s -> 5545.33s]  It's probably Jig.
[5545.33s -> 5546.25s]  That makes sense, right?
[5546.25s -> 5548.76s]  I can just have all the food.
[5548.76s -> 5556.24s]  What else is there?
[5556.24s -> 5557.48s]  What if I go invisible?
[5557.48s -> 5567.76s]  Can I just walk around and like take stuff?
[5567.76s -> 5572.33s]  I'm doing it.
[5572.33s -> 5573.39s]  Pulling the pipe from your pack,
[5573.39s -> 5574.71s]  you weave your enchantment.
[5574.71s -> 5577.57s]  The butcher's expression turns from surprise to horror
[5577.61s -> 5579.81s]  as she finds herself dancing involuntarily,
[5579.81s -> 5582.29s]  arms waving this way and that.
[5582.29s -> 5584.40s]  I'm a respectable butcher.
[5584.40s -> 5587.24s]  She croaks before whooping twice and spinning on the spot.
[5587.24s -> 5591.22s]  Stop this.
[5592.20s -> 5600.32s]  Okay, if I, before whooping like woohoo and spinning,
[5600.32s -> 5609.11s]  he's flossing.
[5609.11s -> 5610.95s]  I wonder, okay, stop.
[5610.95s -> 5616.96s]  All right, see, can I get some 50% off?
[5616.96s -> 5620.76s]  I feel like it's, okay, if I stop, she's gonna kill me.
[5620.76s -> 5627.97s]  If she dances more, then maybe I could get some food.
[5627.97s -> 5629.81s]  You keep dancing until she begins
[5629.81s -> 5632.03s]  to wobble at the knees and stumble.
[5632.03s -> 5636.47s]  She falls face down, but you keep her arms thrashing
[5636.47s -> 5638.39s]  and her feet pounding until she is fast asleep,
[5638.39s -> 5641.20s]  still slowly dancing in the grass.
[5641.20s -> 5643.07s]  Oh my God.
[5643.07s -> 5658.57s]  You lower the, wait, she hit her face on the ground?
[5658.57s -> 5660.45s]  You take three joints of raw meat
[5660.45s -> 5661.43s]  from the back of the cart.
[5661.43s -> 5665.02s]  It is all you can handle before your stomach begins to turn.
[5665.02s -> 5672.23s]  You need to cook raw meat.
[5672.23s -> 5678.86s]  All right, I'm gonna go this way and then down.
[5678.86s -> 5683.65s]  Oh, I think we passed through the spell.
[5683.65s -> 5684.85s]  You continue across the prairie.
[5684.85s -> 5685.81s]  Birds wheel overhead.
[5685.81s -> 5688.94s]  Slowly, the sun begins to make its way back down the sky.
[5688.94s -> 5691.76s]  The paths through the field runs north to south,
[5691.76s -> 5695.17s]  with another track leading away to the east.
[5695.17s -> 5698.31s]  Looking east, the path winds away towards tended fields,
[5698.31s -> 5700.64s]  and you can make out the small hut.
[5700.64s -> 5702.60s]  North, the mountains curve round,
[5702.60s -> 5704.26s]  creating a secluded corner.
[5704.26s -> 5706.04s]  You can just about make out the scaffolding
[5706.04s -> 5708.00s]  and the spin workman.
[5708.00s -> 5709.50s]  It is a pleasant enough place though,
[5709.50s -> 5713.06s]  which to stroll, you continue to walk.
[5713.06s -> 5720.94s]  All right, we're good, so I'm gonna just go back down.
[5720.94s -> 5721.90s]  Anytime you hear that sound,
[5721.90s -> 5725.51s]  that means we're changing times.
[5725.51s -> 5726.93s]  You walk on across the grassland
[5726.93s -> 5728.98s]  until you meet the edge of an old road.
[5728.98s -> 5731.72s]  The wind picks up as the evening draws on.
[5731.72s -> 5734.12s]  The route winds and wiggles as it follows the line
[5734.12s -> 5736.25s]  of the towering western cliffs.
[5736.25s -> 5738.61s]  You stride forward.
[5738.61s -> 5744.65s]  We'll go back to the bridge.
[5744.65s -> 5746.21s]  You step off the clear road
[5746.21s -> 5748.59s]  and walk across the now empty plain.
[5748.59s -> 5752.01s]  Clouds rumble as they roll across the dimming sky.
[5752.01s -> 5755.74s]  It'll be dark soon.
[5755.74s -> 5759.29s]  Back to the fissure.
[5759.29s -> 5761.78s]  The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.
[5761.78s -> 5763.64s]  Soon it will be dark.
[5763.64s -> 5766.08s]  You follow the old road to the edge of the fissure.
[5766.08s -> 5768.16s]  The bleak plains stretch away once more.
[5768.16s -> 5771.19s]  Behind you, wind whistles through the fissure.
[5771.19s -> 5772.27s]  Keep going.
[5772.27s -> 5776.82s]  You waste no time.
[5776.82s -> 5782.11s]  Oh, is it in the wrong spot?
[5782.11s -> 5785.67s]  Shit, is it in the wrong spot?
[5785.67s -> 5796.73s]  Hold on.
[5796.73s -> 5803.46s]  I think maybe it has to be here.
[5803.46s -> 5809.66s]  I think so.
[5809.66s -> 5810.94s]  All right, you continue following the road.
[5810.94s -> 5813.30s]  As you walk, the paving improves.
[5813.30s -> 5814.82s]  It becomes smoother.
[5814.82s -> 5815.78s]  Another night begins.
[5815.78s -> 5817.78s]  You should try to find a place to sleep,
[5817.78s -> 5820.69s]  especially after so much walking on an empty stomach.
[5820.69s -> 5823.17s]  You stride across an open stretch of meadow,
[5823.17s -> 5825.57s]  the river to one side, babbling and chattering,
[5825.57s -> 5828.98s]  and the warm night covering the view in the other direction.
[5828.98s -> 5830.78s]  In the near distance floats the sounds of singing
[5830.78s -> 5832.11s]  and feasting.
[5832.11s -> 5839.05s]  It must be a village nearby.
[5839.05s -> 5840.97s]  Paul Fondler wants you to put Family Guy
[5840.97s -> 5844.07s]  in the top right of the screen.
[5844.07s -> 5848.97s]  No, I'm sorry, I can't do that.
[5848.97s -> 5853.57s]  That's literally illegal.
[5853.57s -> 5858.78s]  Put like an episode of Family Guy here.
[5860.14s -> 5861.18s]  I'm just gonna get claimed
[5861.18s -> 5865.15s]  and the stream's gonna get turned off.
[5865.15s -> 5866.75s]  It's on YouTube for free.
[5870.57s -> 5873.70s]  I think some of you guys don't understand
[5873.70s -> 5878.16s]  copyright rebroadcasting laws.
[5878.16s -> 5880.06s]  Just because it's on YouTube
[5880.06s -> 5883.72s]  doesn't mean I can stream it to Twitch.
[5883.72s -> 5884.64s]  I can't do that.
[5884.64s -> 5890.21s]  That's not how it works.
[5890.21s -> 5892.01s]  Oh, hey, it's on YouTube, so I'll just wait.
[5892.01s -> 5894.17s]  It's on YouTube, so let's just watch Family Guy.
[5894.17s -> 5896.29s]  I'm gonna get shut down in a second.
[5899.71s -> 5906.29s]  Paul Fondler is getting a little easy, Paul Fondler.
[5906.29s -> 5908.63s]  You have been unbanned, but keep in mind,
[5908.63s -> 5911.99s]  your power, you're waving some power around here.
[5911.99s -> 5915.12s]  You gotta be careful.
[5916.46s -> 5918.38s]  Put Family Guy in the corner.
[5919.06s -> 5920.90s]  You've got some power here,
[5920.90s -> 5927.27s]  and I'm just gonna tell you that, be careful here.
[5927.27s -> 5930.69s]  All right, let's listen.
[5930.69s -> 5934.16s]  You stop to listen to the carousing,
[5934.16s -> 5936.96s]  trying to place which direction it's coming from.
[5936.96s -> 5938.32s]  But with the winds tossing this way
[5938.32s -> 5941.10s]  and that through the grass, it's hard to place.
[5941.10s -> 5942.74s]  Night birds chatter through the sky.
[5942.74s -> 5944.08s]  All right, we need to rest.
[5944.08s -> 5946.48s]  Maybe I can cook the food.
[5946.48s -> 5947.46s]  No, I can't.
[5947.46s -> 5949.40s]  Laying your pack down on the flagstones,
[5949.40s -> 5951.40s]  you try to settle despite the cold.
[5951.40s -> 5952.28s]  You've not eaten today,
[5952.28s -> 5955.05s]  but there's nothing you can do to fill your belly.
[5955.05s -> 5958.17s]  You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[5958.17s -> 5960.97s]  You dream you are a young boy once more,
[5960.97s -> 5964.45s]  lying on your back near the waterfalls of chawberry wood.
[5964.45s -> 5967.06s]  Gentle spray dusts your face.
[5967.06s -> 5970.33s]  You laugh and a droplet lands in your open mouth.
[5970.33s -> 5971.85s]  But when you wipe away your lips,
[5971.85s -> 5974.53s]  you find there is a slug there.
[5974.53s -> 5975.97s]  Spit it out.
[5975.97s -> 5978.69s]  You spit it out, but more and more slugs appear
[5978.69s -> 5982.25s]  until your mouth is thick with them and you are gagging.
[5982.25s -> 5985.70s]  There seems nothing you can do to clear your mouth.
[5985.70s -> 5987.26s]  Chew them up.
[5987.26s -> 5989.88s]  Reluctantly, you begin to chew the sweet, thick slugs
[5989.88s -> 5991.86s]  into a mass of flesh and slime.
[5992.70s -> 5994.78s]  More slugs pour over your face and eyes and you blink,
[5994.78s -> 5998.58s]  only to find a slavering bristlebeast standing over you.
[5998.58s -> 6021.70s]  Its spittle is drooling into your open mouth.
[6021.70s -> 6027.11s]  Rock turned to stone.
[6027.11s -> 6034.99s]  Talk with animals.
[6034.99s -> 6038.11s]  Pulling out the green wig, you put it on and cast the spell.
[6038.11s -> 6041.19s]  The bristlebeast's snapping jaws translate quickly
[6041.19s -> 6043.70s]  into a clear language.
[6043.70s -> 6045.94s]  Are you my mother?
[6045.94s -> 6047.94s]  Are you my mother?
[6047.94s -> 6052.76s]  Can you feed me as my mother would?
[6052.76s -> 6060.89s]  I am your mother.
[6060.89s -> 6064.30s]  I am your mother, you reply in a cooing noise,
[6064.30s -> 6066.61s]  clicking your tongue for emphasis.
[6066.61s -> 6072.62s]  Mother, you have become so very ugly.
[6072.62s -> 6077.62s]  Oh, you've grown so much.
[6077.62s -> 6079.95s]  You have grown.
[6079.95s -> 6080.95s]  Yes, I have.
[6080.95s -> 6083.07s]  The bristlebeast puffs up with pride.
[6086.25s -> 6090.18s]  Oh, I have some questions for you.
[6090.18s -> 6094.18s]  I must ask you some questions, my dear child.
[6094.18s -> 6098.81s]  The beast nods, but you can feel the spell starting to fade.
[6098.81s -> 6100.41s]  Where are the seven serpents?
[6100.41s -> 6101.57s]  How do I reach Mampang?
[6101.57s -> 6110.79s]  How do I defeat the serpents?
[6116.60s -> 6119.66s]  How about, how do I defeat the serpents?
[6119.66s -> 6122.01s]  How do I defeat the serpents?
[6122.01s -> 6125.39s]  Eat them, the bristlebeast replies.
[6125.39s -> 6127.03s]  The spell fades.
[6127.03s -> 6129.31s]  The creature begins to look around with confusion,
[6129.31s -> 6131.97s]  trying to locate its mother's voice.
[6131.97s -> 6134.77s]  In its search, it scurries away along the road.
[6134.77s -> 6139.00s]  You are safe and alone once more.
[6139.00s -> 6140.68s]  Oh, we can't have...
[6140.68s -> 6144.44s]  I wonder if the bristlebeast shows up later.
[6144.44s -> 6145.28s]  Eat them.
[6148.17s -> 6151.08s]  That's such a funny response.
[6151.08s -> 6154.24s]  By the way, why would I ask questions like that?
[6154.24s -> 6162.63s]  That's the exact response that we would have gotten.
[6162.63s -> 6164.75s]  Well, we don't have to fight anything.
[6164.75s -> 6165.59s]  We're safe.
[6176.17s -> 6178.21s]  All right, no new clues day four.
[6180.94s -> 6182.42s]  The sound of the river chatters around you.
[6182.42s -> 6187.46s]  You continue on your way.
[6187.46s -> 6191.57s]  I mean, we could go this way.
[6191.57s -> 6197.80s]  I gotta move these to different places.
[6197.80s -> 6198.64s]  Okay, let's go.
[6199.08s -> 6206.89s]  Can I not get in here?
[6206.89s -> 6211.31s]  Who the fuck is Ball Fondler?
[6213.11s -> 6215.58s]  Ball Fondler.
[6215.58s -> 6216.42s]  Some people are saying,
[6216.42s -> 6217.94s]  you're gonna get sniped again, Ball Fondler.
[6217.94s -> 6221.06s]  You're gonna get banned again.
[6221.06s -> 6231.68s]  What happened?
[6231.68s -> 6233.47s]  Stop snitching.
[6233.47s -> 6234.31s]  Leave him alone.
[6234.31s -> 6235.15s]  What?
[6235.15s -> 6240.29s]  20 of you have said that in the last two minutes.
[6240.29s -> 6244.06s]  He asked how many baseballs you can fit.
[6244.06s -> 6247.57s]  Bro, that stream was two weeks ago.
[6247.57s -> 6253.01s]  Ball Fondler, come on.
[6253.01s -> 6267.26s]  Come on, dude, that happened already.
[6267.26s -> 6272.81s]  Strike two.
[6272.81s -> 6274.69s]  They said, utter lies and pure deceit.
[6275.61s -> 6283.78s]  I can assure you, my friend.
[6283.78s -> 6285.12s]  Guys, I'm sorry.
[6285.12s -> 6289.26s]  Part of the deal with being unbanned was being unbanned.
[6289.26s -> 6290.10s]  That's it.
[6290.10s -> 6292.70s]  It wasn't you get unbanned,
[6292.70s -> 6294.10s]  and then I get to be a genie
[6294.10s -> 6296.06s]  that answers every question you ever have
[6296.06s -> 6301.94s]  for the rest of the time you're here.
[6301.94s -> 6308.08s]  Let's go in the tower.
[6308.08s -> 6310.32s]  The inside of the tower is cavernous and empty,
[6310.32s -> 6312.70s]  but for a stone staircase.
[6312.70s -> 6313.54s]  I gotta go up.
[6313.54s -> 6316.07s]  I'm gonna cut the vines.
[6316.07s -> 6318.45s]  You slash again at the vines across the roof,
[6318.45s -> 6320.01s]  uncovering the underside of the hatch
[6320.01s -> 6321.29s]  you saw earlier from above.
[6321.29s -> 6322.98s]  It is bolted shut.
[6322.98s -> 6324.98s]  The sap now covers your hands and arms.
[6324.98s -> 6332.86s]  It begins to cool and solidify.
[6332.86s -> 6334.10s]  This is a problem.
[6334.10s -> 6335.38s]  I need to do magic.
[6335.38s -> 6338.12s]  Uh-oh.
[6338.12s -> 6340.00s]  You open your arms wide to raise a spell,
[6340.00s -> 6341.44s]  but before you can craft your magic,
[6341.44s -> 6343.78s]  your arms set into position.
[6343.78s -> 6345.46s]  Your magic fizzles away around you,
[6345.46s -> 6348.86s]  and you are left like a statue,
[6348.86s -> 6350.70s]  both arms raised above your head.
[6350.70s -> 6355.74s]  You are now trapped stiff covered by a solid casing.
[6355.74s -> 6358.14s]  Tip myself over.
[6358.14s -> 6359.54s]  It is a drastic circumstance
[6359.54s -> 6361.22s]  which calls for drastic measures.
[6361.22s -> 6362.98s]  Throwing your weight to one side and then the other,
[6362.98s -> 6363.82s]  you begin to tip
[6363.82s -> 6366.14s]  and finally manage to overbalance toppling
[6366.14s -> 6368.55s]  off the staircase.
[6368.55s -> 6369.83s]  You tumble to the floor
[6369.83s -> 6372.55s]  and the amber casing around your body shatters.
[6372.55s -> 6373.79s]  You are free once more.
[6373.79s -> 6379.50s]  Oh, thank God.
[6379.50s -> 6381.94s]  That was the right move.
[6381.94s -> 6383.62s]  Enjoying your regained mobility,
[6383.62s -> 6385.38s]  you hurry back up the stairs once more
[6385.38s -> 6388.00s]  and pull the trapdoor bolt back.
[6388.00s -> 6389.44s]  The hatch to the roof falls open,
[6389.44s -> 6391.54s]  letting an array of sunshine.
[6391.54s -> 6393.13s]  Now it's time to move on.
[6393.13s -> 6394.09s]  You can go back out to the plane
[6394.09s -> 6395.05s]  or up to the top of the tower.
[6395.05s -> 6395.89s]  All right, cool.
[6395.89s -> 6402.18s]  So let's figure out what I wanna do here.
[6402.18s -> 6403.66s]  Adjust the beam.
[6403.66s -> 6405.70s]  So if I do this,
[6405.70s -> 6409.86s]  can I go back?
[6409.86s -> 6413.83s]  Or I wonder if I need to,
[6413.83s -> 6417.36s]  do I need to teleport to here
[6417.36s -> 6419.08s]  and then walk this way?
[6419.08s -> 6420.88s]  I feel like that's probably what I need to do.
[6420.88s -> 6425.96s]  Maybe you just can't activate it from this side.
[6425.96s -> 6426.80s]  If that's the case,
[6426.80s -> 6427.64s]  I'm gonna go teleport to this
[6427.64s -> 6432.35s]  and then move the thing.
[6432.35s -> 6435.51s]  That's probably accurate.
[6435.51s -> 6438.62s]  Yeah, that's definitely what I'm doing.
[6438.62s -> 6439.50s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[6439.50s -> 6445.20s]  All right, let me teleport over there.
[6445.20s -> 6446.52s]  And then, because this one has,
[6446.52s -> 6447.84s]  we've done all this,
[6447.84s -> 6451.14s]  I will move this one to somewhere else.
[6451.14s -> 6464.83s]  Over here maybe.
[6464.83s -> 6467.70s]  Okay, let's go.
[6467.70s -> 6469.59s]  Oh, actually, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6469.59s -> 6473.54s]  I wanna move this.
[6473.54s -> 6476.34s]  You're gonna play Breath of the Wild?
[6476.34s -> 6477.70s]  Yeah, eventually.
[6477.70s -> 6481.44s]  I don't know when, but eventually.
[6481.44s -> 6488.22s]  Oh, shit, what am I doing?
[6488.22s -> 6490.70s]  The teleport mechanic is sick.
[6490.70s -> 6493.05s]  It's really helpful.
[6493.05s -> 6494.65s]  All right, well, no, I can't.
[6494.65s -> 6496.21s]  I have to keep this aimed over here.
[6496.21s -> 6499.86s]  But I could do this
[6499.86s -> 6501.94s]  and then all this stuff over here
[6501.94s -> 6503.74s]  that I could go check this out.
[6503.74s -> 6505.34s]  So where was the,
[6505.34s -> 6513.10s]  this should be done now, right?
[6513.10s -> 6514.66s]  This should be done.
[6514.66s -> 6520.40s]  Should I go investigate it?
[6520.40s -> 6521.56s]  It got destroyed.
[6521.56s -> 6528.75s]  What the fuck?
[6528.75s -> 6529.59s]  Who destroyed it?
[6529.59s -> 6530.97s]  All right, well, whatever.
[6530.97s -> 6532.34s]  I'm gonna do this for now
[6532.38s -> 6546.94s]  because I wanna be able to go back, so that's good.
[6546.94s -> 6553.13s]  So the plan is let's check out this new stuff,
[6553.13s -> 6555.60s]  go down to the cave again,
[6555.60s -> 6558.49s]  and then up the plan.
[6558.49s -> 6560.02s]  That's what we're doing.
[6560.02s -> 6569.22s]  What the hell?
[6569.22s -> 6570.10s]  You join the road,
[6570.10s -> 6572.98s]  the moaning winds finger at your pack and sword.
[6572.98s -> 6574.91s]  From behind you, a voice says,
[6574.91s -> 6579.24s]  excuse me, turn around.
[6579.24s -> 6580.72s]  You whip around to find a small boy
[6580.72s -> 6582.60s]  holding a black face mask in his hand.
[6582.60s -> 6585.90s]  He pushes it towards you.
[6585.90s -> 6586.74s]  I already have one.
[6586.74s -> 6593.45s]  Wait, where'd you get that?
[6593.45s -> 6595.76s]  Where'd you get that?
[6595.76s -> 6599.68s]  You dropped it, the boy says.
[6599.68s -> 6605.39s]  Keep it, thank him.
[6605.43s -> 6606.39s]  You nod your head and thanks.
[6606.39s -> 6609.46s]  The boy smiles and puts the face mask into your hands.
[6609.46s -> 6619.02s]  Then he steps back and waits for something.
[6619.02s -> 6620.18s]  You squat down into your ankles
[6620.18s -> 6621.98s]  to be more at the boy's level.
[6621.98s -> 6622.90s]  He's clearly local
[6622.90s -> 6627.20s]  and is likely to know a lot about the area.
[6627.20s -> 6630.22s]  Where are you from?
[6630.22s -> 6632.22s]  You ask the boy.
[6632.22s -> 6633.94s]  Kare.
[6633.94s -> 6636.06s]  But I run errands all the way to Tin Pang,
[6636.06s -> 6641.42s]  sometimes enough talk.
[6641.42s -> 6644.94s]  You begin to chug the blimberry in your pack
[6644.94s -> 6650.09s]  as fast as you can, breaking every world record.
[6656.71s -> 6658.52s]  Where's Tin Pang?
[6658.52s -> 6661.79s]  Across the marsh, over the bridge, near the lake.
[6661.79s -> 6664.14s]  You can run there in about a day.
[6664.14s -> 6665.78s]  The idea that this boy can cross
[6665.78s -> 6668.26s]  the entire of the backlands is startling.
[6668.26s -> 6670.84s]  This is the most dangerous land you know.
[6670.84s -> 6673.78s]  The boy is starting to look twitchy.
[6673.78s -> 6675.43s]  Enough talk.
[6675.43s -> 6676.47s]  You lose interest in the boy
[6676.47s -> 6679.42s]  and stand back to your full height.
[6679.42s -> 6682.78s]  Old groans are so boring, the boy complains.
[6682.78s -> 6685.46s]  Without another word, you turn and move away.
[6685.46s -> 6688.67s]  Just being helpful, the boy shouts from behind you
[6688.67s -> 6691.84s]  before he disappears in the other direction along the road.
[6691.84s -> 6693.20s]  It's only later you realize he somehow
[6693.20s -> 6694.96s]  swiped the cloth skull cap from your pack.
[6694.96s -> 6696.88s]  That motherfucker.
[6696.88s -> 6697.96s]  I'm going back.
[6698.44s -> 6720.80s]  I'm just gonna punch you in the face.
[6720.80s -> 6725.38s]  Did I rewind?
[6725.38s -> 6726.22s]  Okay, here we go.
[6726.22s -> 6728.45s]  Excuse me.
[6728.45s -> 6730.61s]  What do I do?
[6730.61s -> 6731.57s]  You made the error before.
[6731.57s -> 6733.43s]  Why did you fall for it again?
[6733.43s -> 6736.55s]  It's been like five, six years.
[6736.55s -> 6738.46s]  Should I just attack?
[6738.46s -> 6739.30s]  Draw sword.
[6739.30s -> 6740.46s]  You draw your sword and the voice yelps.
[6740.46s -> 6741.78s]  I'm not attacking you.
[6741.78s -> 6744.81s]  I thought you might want this.
[6744.81s -> 6746.77s]  He's holding black face mask in his hand.
[6746.77s -> 6748.05s]  He pushed it towards you.
[6748.05s -> 6749.51s]  Thief.
[6749.51s -> 6751.59s]  Suddenly seeing that the top of your pack is open.
[6751.59s -> 6753.48s]  Not a thief, you dropped it.
[6753.48s -> 6760.99s]  The boy says looking warily, snatch it back.
[6760.99s -> 6762.27s]  You snatch back the face mask.
[6762.27s -> 6764.19s]  The boy lets you take it with a shrug.
[6764.19s -> 6765.69s]  Then he waits for something.
[6765.69s -> 6767.41s]  Move on.
[6767.41s -> 6781.05s]  No!
[6781.05s -> 6784.51s]  Do I have to lose an item here?
[6784.51s -> 6785.83s]  All right, what about, okay.
[6785.83s -> 6786.79s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6786.79s -> 6788.05s]  Where'd you get that?
[6788.05s -> 6789.25s]  You dropped it.
[6789.25s -> 6790.73s]  Okay, thank you.
[6790.73s -> 6792.13s]  Okay, offer him a reward.
[6792.13s -> 6793.77s]  You look in your pack.
[6793.77s -> 6797.78s]  Here, have three gold pieces.
[6797.78s -> 6800.78s]  You count out three gold pieces into his palm.
[6800.78s -> 6802.06s]  Wow, thank you.
[6802.06s -> 6803.98s]  By throth, I'm glad I followed you.
[6803.98s -> 6804.86s]  I mean that I was here.
[6804.86s -> 6806.35s]  You know what I mean?
[6806.35s -> 6808.19s]  Okay, fuck you.
[6808.19s -> 6809.23s]  Take my leave.
[6809.23s -> 6812.62s]  The final nod.
[6812.62s -> 6814.30s]  Do I have to lose this every time?
[6814.30s -> 6825.99s]  I'm not going this way.
[6825.99s -> 6828.08s]  I'm not going this way.
[6828.08s -> 6833.60s]  I need, that cloth skull cap is so important.
[6833.60s -> 6840.10s]  Yep, no, fuck that.
[6840.10s -> 6845.14s]  I'm going down here and I don't, I don't, I can't.
[6845.14s -> 6849.14s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[6849.14s -> 6850.42s]  You walk across the prairie.
[6850.42s -> 6855.32s]  Rocky outcrops break the ground here and there.
[6855.32s -> 6857.60s]  It's a random event and you will always lose the item.
[6857.60s -> 6860.38s]  Shit, okay, well, not this time.
[6860.38s -> 6864.50s]  I know, I know, I'm playing wrong, I know.
[6864.50s -> 6867.14s]  Rocky outcrops break the ground here and there.
[6867.14s -> 6871.34s]  And as the trail rises, you are soon walking on bare stone.
[6871.34s -> 6874.65s]  As the sun climbs towards its zenith, the winds pick up.
[6874.65s -> 6877.21s]  The dusty plains have been transformed to fields.
[6877.21s -> 6879.09s]  Though the grass here is littered with rocks
[6879.09s -> 6881.77s]  that have tumbled down from the mountain range to the east.
[6881.77s -> 6882.69s]  From somewhere close at hand,
[6882.69s -> 6886.16s]  a strange whistling noise catches your attention.
[6886.16s -> 6888.82s]  The sound is coming from the other side of a large rock.
[6888.82s -> 6890.02s]  Seems steady enough.
[6890.02s -> 6894.13s]  The sound of a ever running wind.
[6894.13s -> 6897.37s]  Let's look around the rock.
[6897.37s -> 6901.62s]  You peer around the rock and a strange sight greets your eyes.
[6901.62s -> 6902.70s]  Whether a living creature
[6902.70s -> 6905.30s]  or a freak weather effect, you cannot tell.
[6905.30s -> 6907.42s]  But hovering a short way above the ground
[6907.42s -> 6914.92s]  is a swirling twist of air trapped in a cove formed by the rock.
[6914.92s -> 6919.69s]  All right, well, that's bad.
[6919.69s -> 6923.08s]  A small fly buzzes over the head of the whirlwind.
[6923.08s -> 6928.86s]  A moment later, it is sucked in and disappears from sight.
[6928.86s -> 6930.46s]  Try talking to the funnel.
[6937.34s -> 6939.38s]  Let's talk.
[6939.38s -> 6940.46s]  Greetings.
[6940.46s -> 6943.38s]  What manner of pestilence are you?
[6943.38s -> 6946.18s]  The whirlwind kicks a short distance up into the air
[6946.18s -> 6949.36s]  as if leaping, then settles back down again.
[6949.36s -> 6957.37s]  A reaction to your voice or merely a chance movement?
[6964.00s -> 6969.95s]  Okay, well, yeah.
[6969.95s -> 6973.15s]  You pull a goblin tooth from your pack and drop it on the ground,
[6973.15s -> 6974.91s]  casting your spell across it.
[6974.91s -> 6976.95s]  The tooth erupts into a column of smoke.
[6976.95s -> 6980.57s]  And a moment later, a goblin warrior is standing in front of you.
[6980.57s -> 6983.62s]  Order it into the whirlpool.
[6983.62s -> 6986.50s]  You order the monster to approach the whirlpool.
[6986.50s -> 6988.10s]  It strides forward.
[6988.10s -> 6989.42s]  Then something happens.
[6989.42s -> 6992.62s]  And a moment later, the creature has vanished completely.
[6992.62s -> 6996.43s]  The whirlpool itself seems unaffected.
[6996.47s -> 6999.62s]  Suddenly from somewhere above you, you hear a voice.
[6999.62s -> 7001.86s]  Hanalandr, I bring a message.
[7008.70s -> 7011.11s]  Look up.
[7011.11s -> 7013.63s]  You look up into your right, scouring the rock face
[7013.63s -> 7015.71s]  until you spy a small boy,
[7015.71s -> 7019.40s]  leaping from stone to stone like a goat.
[7019.40s -> 7026.22s]  I bring a message from Shadrach the hermit.
[7026.22s -> 7028.87s]  How can I trust you?
[7028.87s -> 7030.35s]  Trust me?
[7030.35s -> 7031.95s]  What are you talking about?
[7031.95s -> 7033.51s]  I've come from Shadrach.
[7033.51s -> 7035.07s]  He leaps closer.
[7035.07s -> 7036.91s]  It's about the fire serpent.
[7036.91s -> 7038.37s]  He's following you.
[7038.37s -> 7040.89s]  He's going to attack you while you sleep.
[7040.89s -> 7042.92s]  Shadrach foresaw it.
[7042.92s -> 7045.84s]  The boy has scaled halfway down the mountainside now
[7045.84s -> 7048.32s]  and is just above the whirlpool in the rocks.
[7048.32s -> 7050.66s]  He is about to jump.
[7050.66s -> 7052.82s]  Wait, wait, don't jump.
[7052.82s -> 7056.03s]  Don't go, don't do that.
[7056.03s -> 7057.22s]  Wait!
[7057.22s -> 7058.38s]  The boy hovers for a moment,
[7058.38s -> 7060.63s]  one foot on the ledge about to jump.
[7060.63s -> 7062.42s]  His eyes meet yours.
[7062.42s -> 7065.02s]  Then the rock his foot is on slips.
[7065.02s -> 7066.98s]  He begins to tumble downwards.
[7066.98s -> 7069.42s]  As he falls, you see him pulled through the air
[7069.42s -> 7071.38s]  towards the whirlpool.
[7071.38s -> 7078.19s]  Look out!
[7081.35s -> 7084.78s]  Magic protection?
[7084.78s -> 7085.62s]  Huff.
[7085.62s -> 7089.06s]  Create wind.
[7089.06s -> 7094.01s]  Wait, should I get big and grab him?
[7094.01s -> 7103.16s]  Call slowness?
[7103.16s -> 7106.06s]  Sense danger.
[7106.06s -> 7108.07s]  That would work.
[7108.07s -> 7115.54s]  I don't have a zip.
[7115.54s -> 7117.50s]  Maybe float?
[7117.50s -> 7119.22s]  A fix.
[7119.22s -> 7125.84s]  That would probably be the right one.
[7125.84s -> 7127.00s]  Protect from magic.
[7127.00s -> 7128.68s]  I'm going to do that one.
[7128.68s -> 7129.72s]  Let's protect from magic.
[7129.72s -> 7131.48s]  Because obviously the goblin didn't get killed.
[7131.48s -> 7132.96s]  The goblin disappeared.
[7132.96s -> 7136.73s]  There has to be some kind of magical spell here.
[7136.73s -> 7141.30s]  Or huff.
[7141.42s -> 7142.74s]  Wouldn't he just fall to the ground?
[7142.74s -> 7143.58s]  Oh, right.
[7143.58s -> 7144.50s]  Not protecting from physics.
[7144.50s -> 7147.46s]  Let's do huff.
[7147.46s -> 7148.86s]  Create wind.
[7148.86s -> 7150.46s]  Because I could just like...
[7150.46s -> 7153.96s]  All right, let's try it.
[7153.96s -> 7155.52s]  Looking to the stars, you craft the magic,
[7155.52s -> 7158.14s]  lifting the gale horn and blowing a loud note.
[7158.14s -> 7160.62s]  The wind blows the falling boy sharply backwards
[7160.62s -> 7162.34s]  away from the whirlpool.
[7162.34s -> 7165.66s]  He lands a little way down the path, momentarily stunned.
[7165.66s -> 7168.18s]  Then he's back on his feet and running towards you.
[7168.18s -> 7169.30s]  Thank you.
[7169.30s -> 7171.40s]  What is that thing?
[7171.40s -> 7175.16s]  I don't know, but it does not look safe.
[7175.16s -> 7177.04s]  The boy chuckles, clearly untroubled
[7177.04s -> 7180.38s]  by how close he came to being sucked into the hole.
[7180.38s -> 7182.18s]  Chadrack told me everything.
[7182.18s -> 7184.59s]  He says.
[7184.59s -> 7188.77s]  He checks things off on his fingers as he speaks.
[7188.77s -> 7191.26s]  The fire serpent doesn't like sand.
[7191.26s -> 7193.65s]  The water serpent doesn't like oil.
[7193.65s -> 7195.82s]  And the moon serpent...
[7199.58s -> 7201.44s]  Is scared of the dark.
[7201.44s -> 7203.64s]  Can only be killed once a month.
[7203.64s -> 7207.05s]  Is scared of the dark.
[7207.05s -> 7212.27s]  Can only be killed once a month?
[7212.27s -> 7215.30s]  Dislikes the light.
[7215.30s -> 7216.54s]  He's scared of fire.
[7216.54s -> 7217.70s]  The boy replies, remembering.
[7217.70s -> 7222.82s]  They are strange beasts, these serpents.
[7224.93s -> 7226.82s]  Anything else?
[7226.82s -> 7228.84s]  The boy shrugs.
[7228.84s -> 7230.60s]  Only good luck.
[7230.60s -> 7232.08s]  He says you will need it.
[7232.08s -> 7234.88s]  Because the archmage will want to kill you very fast
[7234.88s -> 7237.59s]  once you reach the walls of Mampang.
[7237.59s -> 7239.90s]  I don't think that was part of the message.
[7239.90s -> 7241.44s]  And with that, he is gone.
[7241.44s -> 7244.56s]  Running away out of sight and into the mists of the plane.
[7249.81s -> 7256.18s]  The funnel is still here.
[7256.18s -> 7257.86s]  Should have let him die.
[7257.86s -> 7259.42s]  I wouldn't have gotten those tips then.
[7259.42s -> 7263.51s]  What are you talking about?
[7263.51s -> 7264.79s]  Talk all languages.
[7270.93s -> 7272.05s]  Taking the wig from your pack,
[7272.05s -> 7274.62s]  you wear it and form your spell.
[7274.62s -> 7277.45s]  Then you attempt to talk to the Whirlpool,
[7277.45s -> 7279.14s]  but you get no response.
[7279.14s -> 7282.44s]  And the whistling sound from within it is unchanged.
[7282.44s -> 7286.03s]  You remove the wig once more, still puzzled.
[7286.03s -> 7288.27s]  As you consider the Whirlpool,
[7288.27s -> 7290.87s]  a creature in an all-covering hood,
[7290.87s -> 7292.65s]  lopes into view.
[7292.65s -> 7295.47s]  It is carrying something tightly in one hand,
[7295.47s -> 7299.38s]  but you cannot make out what.
[7299.38s -> 7300.59s]  Watch.
[7300.59s -> 7302.94s]  You watch as the creature comes closer,
[7302.94s -> 7305.76s]  passing with spitting distance of the Whirlpool.
[7305.76s -> 7306.60s]  Whatever they're holding,
[7306.60s -> 7316.11s]  it looks like little more than a rock.
[7317.39s -> 7318.23s]  What do I do?
[7318.99s -> 7321.10s]  Should I say hello?
[7321.10s -> 7323.78s]  Shout a warning?
[7323.78s -> 7326.39s]  You can see the stranger approaching the Whirlpool.
[7326.39s -> 7328.63s]  So quickly, you grab them by the arms
[7328.63s -> 7330.39s]  and haul them backwards.
[7330.39s -> 7332.07s]  In a surprise, they drop whatever they were holding
[7332.07s -> 7333.87s]  and the Whirlpool sucks it anyway.
[7333.87s -> 7335.33s]  It sucks it away.
[7335.33s -> 7337.18s]  Oh, God damn it.
[7337.18s -> 7338.70s]  The creature begins to shout in a language
[7338.70s -> 7339.74s]  you do not recognize.
[7339.74s -> 7346.80s]  Oh my God, hold on.
[7346.80s -> 7348.76s]  Just wait, I gotta put this wig on.
[7348.76s -> 7351.55s]  Wait a minute.
[7351.55s -> 7354.60s]  Wait, that's not an animal?
[7355.80s -> 7358.00s]  You put the wig on and go down on your hands and knees
[7358.00s -> 7360.77s]  and start barking at the creature.
[7360.77s -> 7362.77s]  Confused, he walks away.
[7362.77s -> 7364.77s]  Oh my God, all right, yap, right?
[7364.77s -> 7369.71s]  No, it's rap.
[7369.71s -> 7373.00s]  Talk all languages.
[7373.00s -> 7373.84s]  Removing the green wig,
[7373.84s -> 7375.52s]  you pull it onto your head and complete the spell,
[7375.52s -> 7377.36s]  but it seems to make no difference to the language
[7377.36s -> 7379.48s]  uttered by the creature.
[7379.48s -> 7381.09s]  What?
[7381.09s -> 7382.35s]  An animal?
[7382.35s -> 7384.59s]  Curious, unless this attempt at language
[7384.59s -> 7387.39s]  is in fact simply a series of strange noises.
[7394.66s -> 7397.14s]  Casting your spell has caused you to open your arms,
[7397.14s -> 7398.18s]  releasing the creature.
[7398.18s -> 7399.70s]  It dusts itself down.
[7402.14s -> 7405.69s]  Apologize?
[7405.69s -> 7407.45s]  You raise your hands in apology,
[7407.45s -> 7409.97s]  demonstrating that you mean it no harm.
[7409.97s -> 7412.41s]  Grumbling, the creature shambles away westwards,
[7412.41s -> 7416.74s]  knocking into you as it goes.
[7416.74s -> 7418.93s]  Follow the creature.
[7418.93s -> 7420.49s]  You follow the creature along the road,
[7420.49s -> 7422.41s]  but you have only gone a short way
[7422.41s -> 7425.41s]  when it seems to vanish from your sight into the mist.
[7425.41s -> 7428.76s]  You step back to the whirlpool, decide where to go next.
[7428.76s -> 7440.40s]  What?
[7440.40s -> 7441.24s]  Should I do yap?
[7441.24s -> 7444.96s]  Wait, should I go back?
[7444.96s -> 7446.76s]  Somebody made the egg salad, by the way,
[7446.76s -> 7448.00s]  and they said it was really good,
[7448.00s -> 7455.32s]  and they have a picture to prove it.
[7455.32s -> 7463.12s]  Hold on, can I share that on stream?
[7463.12s -> 7464.96s]  Could I share that, the person in the Discord,
[7464.96s -> 7466.08s]  can I share that on stream?
[7466.08s -> 7474.34s]  Do you mind if I share that?
[7474.34s -> 7476.02s]  Oh, they shared it in Discord already, okay.
[7476.02s -> 7494.82s]  All right, let me critique this.
[7494.82s -> 7501.75s]  Hold on, I'm gonna create,
[7501.75s -> 7514.09s]  let me make sure this is correct.
[7514.09s -> 7523.47s]  All right, hold on a second here.
[7523.47s -> 7529.08s]  All right, I'll tell you, that looks okay, that looks good.
[7529.08s -> 7533.08s]  Now you can make it whatever consistency you want, right?
[7533.08s -> 7535.42s]  This looks like baby shit.
[7535.42s -> 7539.54s]  It's egg salad, it's egg salad.
[7539.54s -> 7546.57s]  Stop, they said that this is delicious.
[7546.57s -> 7553.99s]  They said it's delicious, confirmed good.
[7554.03s -> 7555.39s]  Now let me tell you something.
[7555.39s -> 7559.58s]  This is a little wetter for me.
[7559.58s -> 7562.66s]  I would have liked it a little less mayo,
[7562.66s -> 7572.56s]  just a little, by like maybe 10%, 5%, maybe 10%.
[7572.56s -> 7574.92s]  I think you've got the right amount of consistency, though.
[7574.92s -> 7576.49s]  That's what I'm looking for.
[7576.49s -> 7583.77s]  It's chunks, kinda chunky, a little less mayo.
[7583.77s -> 7588.54s]  Confirmed good.
[7588.54s -> 7596.39s]  Yeah, don't zoom in, get it off the screen.
[7596.39s -> 7597.47s]  Was there any celery in it?
[7597.47s -> 7607.54s]  No, no celery.
[7607.54s -> 7609.83s]  All right, where are we?
[7609.83s -> 7614.79s]  That's what they do, this is what they feed pigs.
[7614.79s -> 7616.67s]  What do they feed pigs?
[7616.67s -> 7621.19s]  I actually have, okay, I know that pigs eat slop,
[7621.19s -> 7623.54s]  but what is it?
[7623.54s -> 7625.14s]  What do they feed pigs?
[7625.14s -> 7628.15s]  What is in that?
[7628.15s -> 7633.90s]  I don't even know what it is.
[7633.90s -> 7635.78s]  Everything, but what do you mean everything?
[7635.78s -> 7638.26s]  What is it?
[7638.26s -> 7643.22s]  It's vegetable slop, but you can't just say slop.
[7643.22s -> 7645.94s]  It's vegetable offcuts.
[7651.32s -> 7658.20s]  Whole grain oats and vegetable, why is it slop?
[7658.20s -> 7660.72s]  When I think of chopped up vegetables,
[7660.72s -> 7665.72s]  I don't think of like cement being poured, right?
[7665.80s -> 7668.40s]  Why is it like that?
[7668.40s -> 7673.42s]  It's whole grains and vegetables.
[7673.42s -> 7675.25s]  It's just compost.
[7675.25s -> 7680.49s]  It's expired vegetable, meat ophile, spoiled grains.
[7684.26s -> 7685.62s]  Okay, I have a follow up question.
[7685.62s -> 7690.05s]  Slop is made of 12 eggs, whatever.
[7690.05s -> 7691.53s]  You add water to make it edible.
[7691.53s -> 7693.17s]  Oats are dry as fuck otherwise.
[7693.17s -> 7702.06s]  Okay, so it's mainly oats, like oatmeal.
[7702.06s -> 7705.10s]  So it's oatmeal.
[7705.10s -> 7707.34s]  Okay, I get it, I get it.
[7707.38s -> 7710.22s]  So it's oatmeal with a bunch of other shit
[7710.22s -> 7713.23s]  like ground up into it.
[7714.76s -> 7717.25s]  All right, so is there a reason why?
[7717.25s -> 7720.71s]  How come you don't feed a pig, let's say,
[7720.71s -> 7723.59s]  oh yeah, you're on a diet of like fresh vegetables
[7723.59s -> 7725.50s]  or something, is there a reason?
[7725.50s -> 7726.46s]  How come it's slop?
[7726.46s -> 7729.29s]  Why do they eat slop?
[7729.29s -> 7732.13s]  It's a slurry of stuff left over that we don't wanna eat,
[7732.13s -> 7733.38s]  but it's cheap.
[7733.38s -> 7738.39s]  But would it be better if the pig ate better stuff, right?
[7739.99s -> 7743.07s]  Why have we pigeonholed pigs into just eating slop?
[7743.07s -> 7743.99s]  Does that make any sense?
[7744.03s -> 7749.01s]  What would they eat in the wild?
[7749.01s -> 7751.55s]  Well, yeah, but who cares?
[7751.55s -> 7763.98s]  They like it.
[7763.98s -> 7769.49s]  Dude, it's because we're fucked as a species.
[7769.49s -> 7771.85s]  There's enough, hold on, there's enough nutrients in there
[7771.85s -> 7774.09s]  and they don't care about taste, it's a win-win.
[7774.09s -> 7775.49s]  All right, I'm just curious.
[7775.49s -> 7776.33s]  I don't know if it's like,
[7776.33s -> 7779.85s]  oh, pigs like don't wanna eat slop in the wild
[7779.85s -> 7782.25s]  or they just eat slop and that's what they like.
[7782.25s -> 7784.41s]  They'll go and eat like mud and dirt
[7784.41s -> 7790.06s]  and like shit and stuff, they don't care, right?
[7790.06s -> 7794.72s]  Have you ever seen how massive regular pigs get?
[7794.72s -> 7800.88s]  Yeah, they get huge.
[7800.88s -> 7804.36s]  I actually learned about this in my American history class.
[7804.36s -> 7806.16s]  Pigs will literally eat anything.
[7806.16s -> 7808.20s]  Before modern waste management,
[7808.20s -> 7815.50s]  they were the garbage disposals in the US.
[7815.50s -> 7818.07s]  Oh my God.
[7818.07s -> 7821.39s]  All right, so the whirlpool is still here.
[7825.54s -> 7827.98s]  Pigs are eating Las Vegas casino leftovers
[7827.98s -> 7833.49s]  and it's saving the planet.
[7833.49s -> 7836.37s]  All right, so should I just walk into this?
[7836.37s -> 7838.29s]  Should I send another goblin in?
[7838.29s -> 7840.76s]  No, that would be a mistake.
[7840.76s -> 7846.02s]  I'm gonna do, hold on, there, this is it.
[7846.02s -> 7850.50s]  Safe passage.
[7850.50s -> 7852.30s]  Okay, the voice speaks into your thoughts.
[7852.30s -> 7855.38s]  It tells you that the whirlwind is a rare thing,
[7855.38s -> 7857.81s]  a place with only one direction.
[7857.81s -> 7861.58s]  It can be entered, but it cannot be exited
[7861.58s -> 7864.74s]  and is best avoided.
[7864.74s -> 7869.48s]  Interesting.
[7869.48s -> 7871.44s]  It's a rare thing.
[7871.44s -> 7873.61s]  I'm going in.
[7873.61s -> 7876.09s]  You creep slowly closer to the thing
[7876.09s -> 7878.83s]  until you are barely a sword's length away.
[7878.83s -> 7881.43s]  It remains in position, spinning rapidly.
[7881.43s -> 7884.05s]  From here, you can make out little more about it
[7884.05s -> 7888.10s]  except that deep inside something flashes.
[7888.10s -> 7890.07s]  Go in.
[7890.07s -> 7892.51s]  You reach out a hand above the top of the whirlwind.
[7892.51s -> 7895.70s]  The force that exerts downwards is quite strange.
[7895.70s -> 7898.02s]  Then suddenly without warning, it gets stronger.
[7898.02s -> 7899.82s]  The sound coming from the thing increases
[7899.82s -> 7901.18s]  in pitch dramatically.
[7907.37s -> 7910.83s]  Should I pray?
[7910.83s -> 7913.68s]  Let's pray to the ape.
[7913.68s -> 7916.82s]  You close your eyes and raise a prayer to the ape.
[7916.82s -> 7920.67s]  Has your request been heard?
[7920.67s -> 7923.26s]  You wait to see what will happen.
[7923.26s -> 7929.14s]  The force on your hand is getting significantly stronger.
[7929.14s -> 7932.71s]  I don't know.
[7932.71s -> 7935.23s]  You look to the heavens, hoping to find a spell,
[7935.23s -> 7938.15s]  but when you try to pull your hand back to begin casting,
[7938.19s -> 7939.86s]  you find you cannot move.
[7939.86s -> 7943.91s]  It is too strongly held in place above the whirlwind.
[7943.91s -> 7945.63s]  A moment later, the force has tugged your arm
[7945.63s -> 7947.32s]  down inside the whirlwind.
[7947.32s -> 7949.20s]  From there, you cannot save yourself.
[7949.20s -> 7950.86s]  You are trapped inside.
[7950.86s -> 7952.82s]  And whatever happens there is so quick
[7952.82s -> 7958.70s]  that you lose consciousness before you understand it.
[7958.70s -> 7968.89s]  The ape didn't even do anything.
[7968.89s -> 7970.93s]  All right, peer around the rock.
[7970.93s -> 7971.77s]  There's the whirlwind.
[7971.77s -> 7980.68s]  All right, this time we're gonna wait the creature, right?
[7980.68s -> 7982.81s]  Try talking to the funnel.
[7982.81s -> 7985.01s]  Okay, I bring him, oh shit, I went so far back.
[7985.01s -> 7987.42s]  All right, I bring a message.
[7987.42s -> 7992.17s]  How can I trust you?
[7992.17s -> 7994.73s]  Oh, wait, all right, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7994.73s -> 7995.57s]  Okay, so what was it?
[7995.57s -> 7997.54s]  It was the wind.
[8001.39s -> 8003.31s]  These old adventure books are so bullshit.
[8003.31s -> 8005.11s]  Like you forgot to investigate a kitchen
[8005.11s -> 8006.63s]  and didn't pick up the garlic,
[8006.63s -> 8009.11s]  so you die to a vampire five hours later.
[8011.90s -> 8014.42s]  That's true, that's funny.
[8014.42s -> 8019.70s]  All right, it was Huff.
[8019.70s -> 8023.84s]  Okay, I don't know what that was.
[8023.84s -> 8025.72s]  It dislikes the light?
[8025.72s -> 8026.56s]  Scared of fire.
[8026.56s -> 8030.06s]  All right, you guys have to remember this.
[8030.06s -> 8034.50s]  Okay, I think we move on.
[8034.50s -> 8035.46s]  Unless I can get the item
[8035.46s -> 8046.18s]  from whatever that person was holding.
[8046.18s -> 8047.81s]  Oh, sure, I'm gonna leave.
[8047.81s -> 8062.02s]  I'm gonna die again.
[8062.02s -> 8064.18s]  Okay, here we go.
[8064.18s -> 8067.08s]  Here comes the creature.
[8067.08s -> 8073.06s]  Wave, I'm gonna wave a greeting, right?
[8073.06s -> 8073.98s]  Greetings, you declare.
[8073.98s -> 8076.18s]  The creature leaps in alarm, arms going wide,
[8076.18s -> 8078.14s]  and drops whatever it was holding.
[8078.14s -> 8080.10s]  A moment later, the whirlpool has sucked it away.
[8080.10s -> 8085.35s]  God damn it, no!
[8085.35s -> 8090.82s]  Whatever, follow the creature, he disappears.
[8090.82s -> 8099.27s]  Shit, oh, I fucked it up, I'm moving on.
[8099.27s -> 8102.66s]  All right, so I wanted to go this way.
[8102.66s -> 8107.33s]  Isn't he live here?
[8107.37s -> 8109.89s]  You make your way over the grass-covered rocks and boulders
[8109.89s -> 8112.93s]  following the trail where you can
[8112.93s -> 8114.88s]  and scrambling the rest of the way.
[8114.88s -> 8117.16s]  The sun has reached its highest point now.
[8117.16s -> 8119.69s]  Out of the shade, the air is baking hot.
[8119.69s -> 8122.81s]  Once again, you see the distinctive fishtail rock
[8122.81s -> 8124.29s]  sticking up from the earth.
[8124.29s -> 8126.80s]  There is no sign of Shadrach the hermit.
[8126.80s -> 8131.00s]  The fire outside the cave has burned down to black embers.
[8131.00s -> 8133.40s]  You try calling out for Shadrach once more,
[8133.40s -> 8135.15s]  but nothing more happens.
[8135.15s -> 8140.46s]  Wherever he is, whenever he is, it seems he has moved on.
[8140.46s -> 8142.98s]  You march on, feeling the day's first rumblings of hunger
[8142.98s -> 8144.51s]  in your stomach.
[8144.51s -> 8147.46s]  Checking through your pack, you suddenly stop short.
[8147.46s -> 8157.54s]  So, oh, come on, this stupid kid.
[8157.66s -> 8172.04s]  Oh, God damn it, I don't think I can do anything here.
[8172.04s -> 8175.00s]  If I look around, the little boy is gonna be here
[8175.00s -> 8179.78s]  and he's gonna take my cap.
[8179.78s -> 8185.56s]  He gets to you if you do the tornado encounter.
[8187.13s -> 8193.35s]  All right, well, I'm gonna look around.
[8193.35s -> 8194.95s]  You look around, but see nothing.
[8194.95s -> 8196.39s]  There is no hole in your pack,
[8196.39s -> 8198.03s]  but things do not simply disappear.
[8198.03s -> 8200.34s]  Think back.
[8200.34s -> 8201.78s]  You think back, racking your brain,
[8201.78s -> 8208.66s]  then you remember the creature by the whirlpool.
[8208.66s -> 8217.65s]  Oh, my God.
[8217.65s -> 8219.13s]  That's, no, it's too far, man.
[8219.13s -> 8220.17s]  It is, it's too far.
[8220.17s -> 8223.43s]  I fucked it up, it's way too far.
[8223.43s -> 8228.01s]  Revenge will be mine.
[8228.01s -> 8230.66s]  Lifting your voice to the ape, you vow revenge
[8230.66s -> 8233.88s]  should you ever encounter the hooded creature again.
[8233.88s -> 8236.40s]  But nothing changes as a result of your cursing.
[8236.40s -> 8237.68s]  You will have to find the creature
[8237.68s -> 8241.66s]  should you wish to recover the face mask.
[8241.66s -> 8245.23s]  God damn it, should I go back?
[8245.23s -> 8253.21s]  All right, what if I, I'm walking back here.
[8253.21s -> 8255.17s]  You are back at the pool of whirling air.
[8255.17s -> 8278.95s]  Shit, he's not here.
[8278.99s -> 8288.74s]  God damn it.
[8288.74s -> 8290.74s]  Okay, I wanted to go around here.
[8290.74s -> 8293.95s]  I wanted to go back here.
[8293.95s -> 8300.98s]  So you check the tree.
[8300.98s -> 8302.70s]  You wade once more through the long grass.
[8302.70s -> 8309.10s]  The woman with whom you spoke earlier has gone.
[8309.10s -> 8312.54s]  Let's go ahead and check this.
[8312.54s -> 8313.62s]  Have we gone back to the cave?
[8313.62s -> 8316.14s]  That's where we're heading now.
[8316.14s -> 8318.86s]  You walk on across the prairie until you join an old road.
[8318.86s -> 8320.78s]  The sun lowers towards the horizon.
[8320.78s -> 8322.30s]  Soon it will be dark.
[8322.30s -> 8323.90s]  The road is now well-paved
[8323.90s -> 8326.14s]  and bears the marks of many travelers
[8326.14s -> 8329.85s]  right down to steaming piles of cattle dung.
[8329.85s -> 8335.11s]  Someone seems to have dropped a package here.
[8335.11s -> 8338.50s]  Let's take a look.
[8338.50s -> 8340.87s]  You look down at the package.
[8340.87s -> 8342.63s]  It is a cloth-wrapped parcel
[8342.63s -> 8346.46s]  from which comes a strong smell of uncooked fish.
[8346.46s -> 8349.56s]  A cart rolls past without stopping.
[8349.56s -> 8351.54s]  I'm taking it.
[8351.54s -> 8352.38s]  You pick up the parcel,
[8352.38s -> 8354.34s]  the fish appear to be in good condition.
[8354.34s -> 8357.64s]  It must have fallen from a cart only a few hours before.
[8357.64s -> 8360.93s]  But where is there to find fresh fish out here?
[8360.93s -> 8366.83s]  I got a lot of raw food.
[8366.83s -> 8374.22s]  All right, I need to go this way.
[8374.22s -> 8376.91s]  The road curves gently as you follow it.
[8376.91s -> 8378.74s]  The sun has all but gone.
[8378.74s -> 8381.22s]  This road is a broad serviceable highway
[8381.22s -> 8384.70s]  designed for heavy wagons or marching armies.
[8384.74s -> 8388.83s]  On either side, grassy fields lead into the distance.
[8388.83s -> 8390.03s]  Oh, fuck off.
[8390.03s -> 8393.54s]  I don't have a face mask anymore.
[8393.54s -> 8397.98s]  From behind you, a voice says, excuse me.
[8397.98s -> 8399.10s]  I don't, what is he gonna have?
[8399.10s -> 8405.95s]  I don't have a face mask.
[8405.95s -> 8407.35s]  If I ignore it, does that matter?
[8407.35s -> 8412.50s]  Can I just leave?
[8412.50s -> 8415.03s]  I'm gonna ignore.
[8415.03s -> 8415.87s]  You ignore it.
[8415.87s -> 8418.62s]  Another mirage, like the one you heard before.
[8418.62s -> 8422.57s]  Excuse me, are you deaf?
[8422.57s -> 8424.78s]  Let it go.
[8424.78s -> 8426.42s]  You shake your head and leave the mirage behind,
[8426.42s -> 8427.90s]  grumbling to itself.
[8427.90s -> 8429.42s]  You continue on your journey.
[8429.42s -> 8447.84s]  Did I lose anything?
[8447.84s -> 8450.60s]  Where's my skull cap?
[8450.60s -> 8452.59s]  Fuck.
[8452.59s -> 8464.84s]  Where's my skull cap?
[8464.84s -> 8473.94s]  What the fuck?
[8473.94s -> 8478.38s]  I don't think I can stop this.
[8478.38s -> 8482.93s]  Draw my sword.
[8482.93s -> 8484.89s]  He's holding a cloth skull cap in his hand.
[8484.89s -> 8486.86s]  He pushes it towards you.
[8486.86s -> 8488.67s]  Okay, where did you get that?
[8488.67s -> 8489.97s]  You dropped it.
[8489.97s -> 8492.94s]  Okay, thank you.
[8492.94s -> 8495.02s]  He puts the skull cap into your hands.
[8495.02s -> 8497.30s]  Then he, okay, goodbye.
[8497.30s -> 8517.02s]  Thank you, I appreciate it, and he took the sun jewel.
[8517.02s -> 8517.86s]  Fuck this kid.
[8517.86s -> 8522.01s]  I'm running away, I'm going the other way.
[8522.01s -> 8525.50s]  You follow the road back to the edge of the cliff.
[8525.50s -> 8528.54s]  Clouds begin to tumble across the darkening sky.
[8528.54s -> 8531.80s]  The cliff face is covered in eyes and you freeze.
[8531.80s -> 8536.24s]  Then you realize that they are the eyes of stone icons,
[8536.24s -> 8538.34s]  carved from the rock face itself,
[8538.34s -> 8541.75s]  clustered as tightly as barnacles on a rock.
[8541.75s -> 8547.31s]  A few coins lie at the base of the cliff.
[8547.31s -> 8548.87s]  Look at the icons.
[8548.87s -> 8551.70s]  The icons are each about the size of a small dog
[8551.70s -> 8554.86s]  and are carved wherever they could be made to fit.
[8554.86s -> 8557.64s]  So I'm taking advantage of natural colors in the rocks,
[8557.64s -> 8559.40s]  buttresses and points.
[8559.40s -> 8561.48s]  Each is subtly different.
[8561.48s -> 8563.28s]  And though they are stylized,
[8563.28s -> 8567.50s]  they are clearly intended to be human.
[8567.50s -> 8569.46s]  You look at the scattered coins.
[8569.46s -> 8572.90s]  They're an eclectic mixture of metals and currencies.
[8572.90s -> 8575.47s]  Many are discolored from their time on the ground.
[8575.47s -> 8579.19s]  It is astonishing they have not been taken already.
[8579.19s -> 8583.08s]  You spy two or three gold pieces in among them.
[8583.08s -> 8585.45s]  A woman approaches across the grass from the road.
[8585.45s -> 8588.97s]  She looks familiar from somewhere, but you can't place it.
[8588.97s -> 8591.13s]  She nods to you and stops at the cliff face
[8591.13s -> 8595.17s]  to look at the icons.
[8595.17s -> 8596.57s]  Greetings.
[8596.57s -> 8598.28s]  You raise a hand in greeting.
[8598.28s -> 8601.54s]  The woman smiles a little shyly, but does not say anything.
[8601.54s -> 8607.08s]  She opens her bag and calm as anything takes out a hammer.
[8607.08s -> 8609.32s]  That's a threat.
[8609.32s -> 8612.76s]  Watch what she does.
[8612.76s -> 8613.74s]  You watch the woman.
[8613.74s -> 8615.70s]  She turns her attention to the cliff,
[8615.70s -> 8618.68s]  choosing a clear spot within reach.
[8618.68s -> 8619.56s]  She pulls out a chisel
[8619.56s -> 8625.64s]  and begins to splinter away at the rock.
[8625.64s -> 8627.92s]  See what she carves.
[8627.92s -> 8629.90s]  Slowly the carving takes shape.
[8629.90s -> 8635.01s]  Another icon with largest eyes and squat bent legs.
[8635.01s -> 8636.69s]  She performs the carving very quickly.
[8636.69s -> 8641.68s]  Perhaps she has carved several of these before.
[8641.68s -> 8643.90s]  Faster than you expected, she is finished.
[8643.90s -> 8646.00s]  The new icon sits in a cluster of other icons
[8646.00s -> 8648.74s]  and already looks as though it has always been there.
[8648.74s -> 8650.86s]  She steps back, putting the chisel away,
[8650.86s -> 8655.78s]  clearly pleased with her work.
[8655.78s -> 8657.79s]  What is this icon for?
[8657.79s -> 8659.12s]  You ask.
[8659.12s -> 8662.38s]  The woman smiles and you realize the brimming
[8662.38s -> 8664.49s]  with happiness that she is showing.
[8664.49s -> 8668.71s]  She raises her arms in cradling gestures and smiles.
[8668.71s -> 8670.56s]  Then she points at the icon.
[8670.56s -> 8671.94s]  Then with a hand raised,
[8671.94s -> 8675.41s]  she turns and hurries away across the grass.
[8675.41s -> 8678.69s]  You're alone once more facing the hundreds of curious icons
[8678.69s -> 8683.49s]  plus one in the ancient cliff face.
[8683.49s -> 8693.39s]  If I take the coins, I'm gonna anger the gods.
[8693.39s -> 8696.40s]  I'm gonna climb the cliff.
[8696.40s -> 8697.72s]  You try climbing the cliff face,
[8697.72s -> 8700.56s]  but despite the carved icons providing grips,
[8700.56s -> 8702.82s]  they have not been designed for the purpose
[8702.82s -> 8704.62s]  and they are spread too far apart
[8704.62s -> 8707.16s]  or clustered uselessly close together.
[8707.16s -> 8709.04s]  A monkey might be able to make the climb perhaps,
[8709.04s -> 8711.13s]  but a man with a sword could not.
[8711.13s -> 8718.88s]  You give up and drop back to the grass.
[8718.88s -> 8719.98s]  Just take the coins.
[8719.98s -> 8724.47s]  They're probably here for a reason.
[8724.47s -> 8728.45s]  They have to be here for a reason.
[8728.45s -> 8730.18s]  This is such bait.
[8730.18s -> 8733.59s]  This is RPG bait.
[8733.59s -> 8743.41s]  Sorry, we're not falling for RPG bait.
[8743.41s -> 8744.69s]  Can I avoid this kid now?
[8744.69s -> 8751.44s]  I'm going up to the tree and then over.
[8751.44s -> 8753.59s]  Yep, I'm gonna sleep here.
[8753.59s -> 8756.49s]  This kid will not be here in the morning.
[8756.49s -> 8758.61s]  You walk away from the cliff across the grassland.
[8758.61s -> 8759.45s]  Night falls.
[8759.45s -> 8760.37s]  You need to rest,
[8760.37s -> 8765.95s]  especially after traveling all day without food.
[8765.95s -> 8767.35s]  You set yourself down on the plane.
[8767.35s -> 8771.09s]  Sorry, there is no tree trunk to rest your back against.
[8771.09s -> 8772.78s]  You have eaten what?
[8772.78s -> 8775.14s]  You set yourself down on the plane.
[8775.14s -> 8777.72s]  Sorry, there's a tree trunk to rest your back against.
[8777.72s -> 8778.99s]  Why not?
[8778.99s -> 8783.17s]  You've eaten nothing but your pack is empty.
[8783.17s -> 8785.68s]  You lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[8785.68s -> 8787.97s]  Your dreams quickly become nightmares.
[8787.97s -> 8791.12s]  There's a rope around your neck growing tighter.
[8791.12s -> 8793.36s]  The King of Aniland stands before you,
[8793.36s -> 8795.93s]  cursing you for your failure.
[8795.93s -> 8799.06s]  You were sent for the crown,
[8799.06s -> 8802.18s]  but instead you wandered the wilderness like a fool.
[8802.18s -> 8805.13s]  Explain.
[8805.13s -> 8808.42s]  You open your mouth to explain, but you cannot speak.
[8808.42s -> 8812.15s]  You cannot even find words to breathe.
[8812.15s -> 8813.61s]  Claw at the rope.
[8813.61s -> 8816.25s]  You reach up to your throat to claw away the rope,
[8816.25s -> 8820.35s]  to find that it's swelled up to be as thick as your arm,
[8820.35s -> 8823.02s]  as those submerged underwater.
[8823.06s -> 8826.62s]  Then one end of the rope splits and bites at your hand.
[8826.62s -> 8829.59s]  There is no rope, but it's a snake.
[8829.59s -> 8831.61s]  Your eyes flick open and there's a spare snake
[8831.61s -> 8832.75s]  is wrapped around your throat,
[8832.75s -> 8852.39s]  breathing its miserable breath into your eyes.
[8852.39s -> 8856.04s]  Summon replica creature.
[8856.04s -> 8857.16s]  Oh, let me read your mind
[8857.16s -> 8860.16s]  while you fucking choke me to death.
[8867.73s -> 8870.88s]  A grenade that close?
[8870.88s -> 8873.34s]  What is D?
[8873.34s -> 8879.69s]  Oh, Doze, Slowness.
[8879.69s -> 8887.26s]  Hot would probably be bad.
[8887.26s -> 8890.28s]  I'm gonna say it's probably...
[8890.44s -> 8895.52s]  Oh, dude, Doze, Slowness.
[8895.52s -> 8897.32s]  You move the starlight into order around you,
[8897.32s -> 8898.64s]  and the moment the spell takes effect,
[8898.64s -> 8900.36s]  the serpent begins to slow down
[8900.36s -> 8903.42s]  to a fraction of its previous speed.
[8903.42s -> 8904.26s]  You draw your sword,
[8904.26s -> 8906.36s]  the snake leaps back from you, bearing its fangs.
[8906.36s -> 8909.40s]  All right, that was huge.
[8909.40s -> 8910.76s]  Let's go full blast.
[8910.76s -> 8912.28s]  5.5.
[8912.28s -> 8913.40s]  It's all right, I can do another full blast.
[8913.40s -> 8919.12s]  It's fine, I'll win.
[8919.12s -> 8920.68s]  Full blast again?
[8920.68s -> 8922.08s]  Yep.
[8922.08s -> 8922.92s]  That's damn it.
[8922.92s -> 8924.00s]  Oh, I almost killed it in one hit.
[8924.00s -> 8926.08s]  Again.
[8926.08s -> 8930.68s]  No, rewind.
[8930.68s -> 8938.60s]  I'm good.
[8938.60s -> 8945.10s]  Am I okay?
[8945.10s -> 8947.24s]  You attack sadly.
[8947.24s -> 8953.56s]  Oh, I'm depressed.
[8953.56s -> 8956.86s]  You feel somewhat saddened by the idea of conflict.
[8956.86s -> 8957.88s]  You swing out wildly,
[8957.88s -> 8959.72s]  not really expecting to chop the creature in two
[8959.72s -> 8962.02s]  as it tries to ease itself away.
[8962.02s -> 8963.80s]  You get a passing cut.
[8963.80s -> 8966.08s]  The despair snake is retreating, of course,
[8966.08s -> 8968.76s]  but you manage to more or less keep pace.
[8968.76s -> 8970.16s]  You swipe at the air with your sword,
[8970.16s -> 8971.48s]  for what good it will do.
[8971.48s -> 8973.57s]  Your blow hits home,
[8973.57s -> 8974.61s]  cutting into the soft flesh
[8974.61s -> 8978.75s]  of the useless snake's exposed neck.
[8978.75s -> 8980.79s]  The despair snake is moving more like a slug now.
[8980.79s -> 8984.72s]  You can't help feeling it seems quite pathetic.
[8984.72s -> 8985.92s]  Then the despair snake is oozing
[8985.92s -> 8989.12s]  across the rocks towards you with an unstoppable fixation.
[8989.12s -> 8990.00s]  You try a quick stab,
[8990.00s -> 8992.36s]  but the effort is wasted as it moves like water
[8992.36s -> 8994.50s]  and your blade seems to pass straight through it.
[8994.50s -> 8996.62s]  It knocks you backwards, your head spins.
[8996.62s -> 8997.98s]  You're just spinning
[8997.98s -> 8999.58s]  and the sweat is pouring down your face.
[8999.58s -> 9004.59s]  You must look awful.
[9004.59s -> 9007.23s]  Oh, it's pathetic really, but it's all you have.
[9007.23s -> 9008.31s]  All right, you feel much better.
[9008.31s -> 9010.84s]  That's funny.
[9010.84s -> 9011.76s]  You gasp with relief.
[9011.76s -> 9016.46s]  The cold night closes in over you and you try to sleep.
[9016.46s -> 9024.04s]  You found three new clues.
[9024.04s -> 9026.67s]  Okay, you cannot afford to stand around.
[9026.67s -> 9029.90s]  Do not stop me on the road.
[9029.90s -> 9032.33s]  You little shit.
[9032.33s -> 9048.32s]  Fuck off, rewind.
[9048.32s -> 9050.56s]  No, he's following me around.
[9050.56s -> 9052.38s]  He's following me around.
[9052.38s -> 9054.10s]  I have, whatever.
[9054.10s -> 9056.34s]  Would I rather have the skull cap for Tell
[9056.34s -> 9064.64s]  or would I rather have the Sun Jewel?
[9064.64s -> 9065.48s]  What's more useful?
[9065.48s -> 9071.98s]  The Sun Jewel is probably more useful.
[9071.98s -> 9072.82s]  I don't know.
[9072.82s -> 9087.64s]  The skull cap is reading minds.
[9087.64s -> 9088.48s]  I don't know.
[9088.48s -> 9089.66s]  Tell is so useful though,
[9089.66s -> 9091.38s]  but the Sun Jewel is so useful.
[9091.38s -> 9095.74s]  All the dark areas.
[9095.74s -> 9105.88s]  Thief, snatch it back.
[9105.88s -> 9119.63s]  Talk to him.
[9119.63s -> 9121.88s]  How do you know the seven serpents?
[9121.88s -> 9125.78s]  Sounds like one of Shadrach's stories.
[9125.78s -> 9127.91s]  So you know Shadrach?
[9127.91s -> 9129.25s]  Of course I do.
[9129.25s -> 9130.23s]  Everyone knows Shadrach.
[9130.23s -> 9131.79s]  He's a brute and beats children
[9131.79s -> 9137.18s]  if they make too much noise near his cave.
[9137.18s -> 9140.12s]  He seemed most ferocious.
[9140.12s -> 9141.60s]  He hates children.
[9141.60s -> 9143.00s]  He says they're all thieves and villains.
[9143.00s -> 9150.61s]  The boy's starting to look twitchy.
[9150.61s -> 9153.73s]  How do I cross Lake Iklala?
[9153.73s -> 9155.25s]  You can get a ride on a fishing boat
[9155.25s -> 9158.11s]  if you don't mind dawdling while they catch their fish.
[9158.11s -> 9159.47s]  The boy hops on one foot.
[9159.47s -> 9161.08s]  Where are you from?
[9161.08s -> 9163.02s]  Karay, okay.
[9163.02s -> 9163.86s]  I have to go now.
[9163.86s -> 9166.52s]  I really have to go.
[9167.08s -> 9169.19s]  Where?
[9169.19s -> 9170.01s]  Why?
[9170.01s -> 9171.73s]  I'm in a hurry, he answers.
[9171.73s -> 9172.57s]  Oh, God damn it.
[9172.57s -> 9173.39s]  Whatever.
[9173.39s -> 9174.23s]  I lost the Sun Jewel, but fuck it.
[9174.23s -> 9176.06s]  Whatever.
[9176.06s -> 9176.90s]  That's it.
[9176.90s -> 9178.62s]  It's gone.
[9178.62s -> 9179.68s]  It's gone.
[9179.68s -> 9180.52s]  Nothing I can do about it.
[9180.52s -> 9188.70s]  Whatever.
[9188.70s -> 9189.52s]  Okay.
[9189.52s -> 9192.14s]  What about this stuff?
[9192.14s -> 9198.59s]  Let me check this out.
[9198.59s -> 9200.25s]  You continue across the grassland,
[9200.25s -> 9201.97s]  falling into an easy stride.
[9201.97s -> 9204.77s]  The Sun continues to climb the steep sky.
[9204.77s -> 9206.96s]  The fields of grass are pleasant here.
[9206.96s -> 9208.44s]  In the cool shade of the cliff face,
[9208.44s -> 9213.72s]  you could pause and rest if you wanted to.
[9213.72s -> 9214.56s]  Okay.
[9214.56s -> 9215.38s]  You stretch out on the ground.
[9215.38s -> 9217.22s]  The very earth itself feels warm
[9217.22s -> 9219.66s]  and soothes your tired muscles.
[9219.70s -> 9221.60s]  The Sun is hot now.
[9221.60s -> 9223.33s]  Little bit longer.
[9223.33s -> 9224.77s]  You sit a while longer in the grass,
[9224.77s -> 9226.45s]  watching the clouds move overhead.
[9226.45s -> 9227.29s]  Then quite suddenly,
[9227.29s -> 9228.69s]  something hot erupts from beneath you
[9228.69s -> 9229.73s]  and scalds your back.
[9229.73s -> 9231.25s]  Oh, come on.
[9231.25s -> 9238.93s]  You've been lying across the blowhole of a steam vent.
[9238.93s -> 9244.49s]  Fuck.
[9244.49s -> 9246.33s]  Once again, you return to the foot of the cliffs.
[9246.33s -> 9247.57s]  The Sun is beginning to lower
[9247.57s -> 9249.82s]  and the air begins to cool.
[9249.82s -> 9251.44s]  Looking back up at the cliff,
[9251.44s -> 9253.76s]  it seems impossibly high.
[9253.76s -> 9255.08s]  It is as though the backlands
[9255.08s -> 9259.69s]  was formed from the boot print of a passing soldier.
[9259.69s -> 9263.23s]  Let's get up that cliff.
[9263.23s -> 9264.07s]  Looking up at the cliff,
[9264.07s -> 9265.79s]  you see a line of carved stone blocks,
[9265.79s -> 9267.51s]  which appear to be the remains
[9267.51s -> 9269.62s]  of an ancient staircase,
[9269.62s -> 9271.02s]  a way upwards.
[9271.02s -> 9271.86s]  But near the base,
[9271.86s -> 9273.30s]  the stones are worn and broken.
[9273.30s -> 9285.85s]  There's no way to reach them to climb back.
[9287.09s -> 9287.93s]  Probably float, right?
[9287.93s -> 9293.08s]  Or zen?
[9293.08s -> 9295.69s]  No.
[9295.69s -> 9299.24s]  I don't have zip.
[9299.24s -> 9300.56s]  No.
[9300.56s -> 9317.66s]  How do I get up here?
[9317.66s -> 9318.50s]  Okay.
[9318.50s -> 9320.24s]  The voice suggests magic may be the only way
[9320.24s -> 9322.20s]  back up the cliff side.
[9322.20s -> 9325.84s]  Really?
[9325.84s -> 9336.16s]  I don't think I have anything.
[9336.16s -> 9338.62s]  Talk is disease.
[9338.62s -> 9340.97s]  How?
[9340.97s -> 9341.93s]  Zen or a zip,
[9341.93s -> 9345.79s]  which I don't have a zip.
[9345.79s -> 9352.12s]  I don't think I can get up there.
[9352.12s -> 9355.95s]  That's unfortunate.
[9355.95s -> 9357.71s]  I mean, I guess I can follow the...
[9357.71s -> 9362.53s]  No, shit.
[9362.53s -> 9363.65s]  The item stolen by the boy
[9363.65s -> 9365.37s]  can sometimes be found in the holes
[9365.37s -> 9369.24s]  full of steam from the game's first area.
[9369.24s -> 9381.36s]  Why, I was just there.
[9381.36s -> 9389.84s]  Use a rope?
[9389.84s -> 9390.68s]  What about here?
[9390.68s -> 9391.50s]  Can I do it?
[9391.50s -> 9393.22s]  Stop it.
[9393.22s -> 9398.16s]  Can I go from the cliff side?
[9398.16s -> 9399.86s]  You walk along the base of the cliff.
[9399.86s -> 9401.39s]  Darkness closes in.
[9401.39s -> 9402.91s]  You should find a suitable spot to sleep,
[9402.91s -> 9405.60s]  especially after so long walking with an empty belly.
[9405.60s -> 9409.02s]  Behind you, the rock rises almost sheer into the sky.
[9409.02s -> 9409.84s]  In the darkness,
[9409.84s -> 9412.36s]  you can make out little of the trail ahead.
[9412.36s -> 9413.46s]  Wandering away into the dark
[9413.46s -> 9417.34s]  would be a dangerous move.
[9417.34s -> 9418.82s]  Oh, it's in the other area, okay.
[9418.82s -> 9423.69s]  Check for visions.
[9423.69s -> 9424.85s]  You have no food in your pack
[9424.85s -> 9428.38s]  and the planes out here are desolate and largely unoccupied.
[9428.38s -> 9430.28s]  You will have to move as quickly as possible
[9430.28s -> 9433.62s]  if you were to avoid starvation.
[9433.62s -> 9438.16s]  Shit.
[9438.16s -> 9462.29s]  Shit, I can't get up there.
[9462.29s -> 9464.33s]  Fuck.
[9464.33s -> 9465.15s]  Are you having fun?
[9465.15s -> 9468.51s]  Yeah, this is one of my favorite games ever made.
[9468.51s -> 9469.35s]  Eat the fish?
[9469.35s -> 9472.77s]  I need to cook it.
[9472.77s -> 9473.81s]  Rewind Randy.
[9473.81s -> 9477.27s]  I'm gonna rest, I have to.
[9477.27s -> 9478.11s]  Without a...
[9478.11s -> 9480.39s]  Wait, there is no shelter at the foot of the cliff.
[9480.39s -> 9483.38s]  Well, there is less wind than at the top.
[9483.38s -> 9485.10s]  But without a bolt hole,
[9485.10s -> 9486.86s]  to nestle in you will be at the mercy
[9486.86s -> 9488.79s]  of any creatures that smell you out.
[9488.79s -> 9492.16s]  And there are not many hours of night left.
[9492.16s -> 9494.79s]  Rest here anyways, let's go.
[9494.79s -> 9497.03s]  Setting down your pack by the foot of the cliff,
[9497.03s -> 9499.26s]  you try to stretch out despite the wind.
[9499.26s -> 9502.76s]  The burns on your body make it hard to get truly comfortable.
[9502.76s -> 9506.61s]  You've tried to eat today.
[9506.61s -> 9508.81s]  You stretch out and rest.
[9508.81s -> 9511.53s]  What is left of the night is filled with visions.
[9511.53s -> 9513.77s]  You see yourself outside your body,
[9513.77s -> 9517.42s]  reaching forward to touch a blue crystal in a brass socket.
[9517.42s -> 9519.78s]  For a moment, a beam of light shines upon,
[9519.78s -> 9522.90s]  upward across the clouds, brilliant and alive.
[9522.90s -> 9525.35s]  Meanwhile, your body burns
[9525.35s -> 9528.08s]  and crumbles to dust where it stands.
[9528.08s -> 9531.06s]  A boy sits on a throne of skulls and swords,
[9531.06s -> 9534.10s]  wearing a crown carved from solid bone.
[9534.10s -> 9535.85s]  He seems not to notice you,
[9535.85s -> 9538.77s]  but plays with a carved model figurine of goblins,
[9538.77s -> 9542.03s]  trolls and demons, playing out a war.
[9542.03s -> 9544.10s]  Though he looks bored by it.
[9544.10s -> 9545.80s]  And even while you sleep,
[9545.80s -> 9547.80s]  you know the serpents are moving towards.
[9547.80s -> 9549.16s]  Mampang.
[9549.16s -> 9550.64s]  And every day you spend out here
[9550.64s -> 9562.47s]  is a day in which your journey might be discovered.
[9562.47s -> 9563.51s]  Morning comes, you rise,
[9563.51s -> 9565.91s]  brush the dust from your cloak and look about you.
[9565.91s -> 9567.59s]  The great cliff rises up into the sky,
[9567.59s -> 9572.02s]  unclimbable, looking ready to topple at any moment.
[9572.02s -> 9573.80s]  Okay.
[9573.80s -> 9576.35s]  All right.
[9576.35s -> 9581.06s]  So I can't get back up here.
[9581.06s -> 9583.18s]  So I did, I got to get back up here
[9583.18s -> 9586.58s]  and do this in the present.
[9586.58s -> 9588.06s]  Because we did pretty much all of this
[9588.06s -> 9590.99s]  in the past and present, besides over here,
[9590.99s -> 9592.89s]  which maybe we'll do that later.
[9592.89s -> 9593.91s]  Or maybe not.
[9593.91s -> 9597.49s]  And then all of this over here was done in the past.
[9597.49s -> 9605.78s]  So I want to go up here and do this in the present.
[9605.78s -> 9606.62s]  Let's get here.
[9606.62s -> 9611.61s]  Oh, I want to go up because I want to go to the bridge.
[9611.61s -> 9614.65s]  Rewind and erase the days of pointless wandering.
[9614.65s -> 9620.86s]  That would be cheating.
[9620.86s -> 9623.48s]  You follow the curve of the cliff's foot once more.
[9623.48s -> 9625.78s]  The sun is not crested yet.
[9625.78s -> 9627.47s]  The last peaks of the east.
[9627.47s -> 9629.11s]  The tower is visible some distance away.
[9629.11s -> 9637.67s]  A broken set of steps some distance above your head.
[9637.67s -> 9638.51s]  Oh, okay.
[9638.51s -> 9643.99s]  We're good.
[9643.99s -> 9644.93s]  You leave the shadow of the cliff once more.
[9644.93s -> 9647.11s]  The moaning winds finger at your pack.
[9647.11s -> 9647.95s]  Okay.
[9647.95s -> 9648.79s]  We're here.
[9648.79s -> 9650.57s]  We did this already.
[9650.57s -> 9653.37s]  So I'm going to go to the bridge now.
[9653.37s -> 9655.28s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[9655.28s -> 9657.68s]  This thing in the past.
[9657.68s -> 9662.34s]  I want to say this.
[9662.34s -> 9664.02s]  You walk on across the prairie
[9664.02s -> 9665.88s]  until you meet the edge of an old road.
[9665.88s -> 9667.82s]  It is very warm now.
[9667.82s -> 9670.07s]  You begin to sweat under your pack.
[9670.07s -> 9672.61s]  The road begins to trace the course of a nearby river
[9672.61s -> 9675.23s]  which leaps with fish and birds.
[9675.23s -> 9678.66s]  You pass a large stone totem.
[9678.66s -> 9680.64s]  Look at the totem.
[9680.64s -> 9683.90s]  The totem picks a short toothy creature with no hair
[9683.90s -> 9687.10s]  and with several ringed earrings in one lobe.
[9687.10s -> 9689.66s]  Not a god, but a god or a goddess.
[9689.66s -> 9690.94s]  Helper creature.
[9690.94s -> 9694.06s]  The type that steals through your window to murder you.
[9694.06s -> 9696.59s]  Should the powers above dictate it.
[9696.59s -> 9701.88s]  It leers at you with two wide eyes above pursed lips.
[9701.88s -> 9705.14s]  Touch the eyes or touch the lips?
[9705.14s -> 9707.87s]  Touch the eyes.
[9707.87s -> 9709.43s]  You brush your fingers over the eyes.
[9709.43s -> 9712.60s]  There is no click, no sting, no sense of energy.
[9712.60s -> 9716.70s]  Perhaps this totem truly is merely made of stone.
[9716.70s -> 9720.50s]  The totem's eyes seem to glint a little.
[9720.50s -> 9722.83s]  Touch the lips.
[9722.83s -> 9725.62s]  You pause remembering the ritual of corga
[9725.62s -> 9728.97s]  and the terrible price of incorrect worship.
[9728.97s -> 9730.94s]  What if this totem is a trap?
[9730.94s -> 9732.50s]  The mouth slightly open.
[9732.50s -> 9734.24s]  There is a darkness inside.
[9734.24s -> 9738.64s]  The lips feel slightly sticky to the touch.
[9738.64s -> 9741.57s]  Kiss the totem.
[9741.57s -> 9745.29s]  You lean down and kiss the totem on the lips.
[9745.29s -> 9747.13s]  There is a quiet click
[9747.13s -> 9749.53s]  and you feel a sting at the back of your throat.
[9754.20s -> 9755.64s]  You begin to hack and wheeze
[9755.64s -> 9758.62s]  hoping to get whatever has entered your mouth back out.
[9758.62s -> 9762.25s]  And after a few moments, a bee flies out.
[9762.25s -> 9765.42s]  Then a second bee flies out from the totem's mouth
[9765.42s -> 9767.65s]  followed by two or three more.
[9767.65s -> 9770.58s]  They disappear up into the air in a way towards the south
[9770.58s -> 9772.90s]  where you can see a field of flowers.
[9772.90s -> 9774.87s]  You gasp with relief.
[9774.91s -> 9779.07s]  The bee in your mouth did not even sting you.
[9779.07s -> 9784.87s]  Put the pipe in the totem's mouth?
[9784.87s -> 9791.02s]  What pipe?
[9791.02s -> 9792.88s]  You take the bamboo pipe from your pack
[9792.88s -> 9795.76s]  and slide it into the totem's mouth.
[9795.76s -> 9797.60s]  It is just narrow enough to fit.
[9797.60s -> 9800.67s]  You feel it stick into something.
[9800.67s -> 9803.12s]  Suck on the pipe.
[9803.12s -> 9806.94s]  Suck, suck on the pipe.
[9806.94s -> 9809.40s]  You place your lips to the pipe and suck.
[9809.40s -> 9810.96s]  A moment later, you're coughing again
[9810.96s -> 9813.25s]  and spitting out a bee.
[9813.25s -> 9815.40s]  Blow on the pipe.
[9815.40s -> 9818.43s]  You blow sharply down on it.
[9818.43s -> 9821.85s]  Suck on the pipe.
[9821.85s -> 9823.35s]  You suck the pipe.
[9823.35s -> 9824.59s]  It is hard work.
[9824.59s -> 9828.38s]  Then a sweet dollop of wax plops into your mouth.
[9828.38s -> 9829.22s]  You take it out.
[9829.22s -> 9832.50s]  It is not much, but enough to cast a spell with.
[9832.50s -> 9835.29s]  Blow on the pipe.
[9835.29s -> 9836.85s]  You blow down the pipe again
[9836.85s -> 9838.35s]  and faintly hear an angry buzzing
[9838.35s -> 9840.33s]  from inside the totem echoing down.
[9840.33s -> 9842.25s]  Suck the pipe.
[9842.25s -> 9843.59s]  You suck on the pipe once more.
[9843.59s -> 9847.16s]  The next bee you suck up manages to sting you in the cheek.
[9847.16s -> 9851.91s]  It is ferociously painful, if not a serious womb.
[9851.91s -> 9853.75s]  Blow on the pipe.
[9853.75s -> 9856.33s]  You blow on the pipe again.
[9856.33s -> 9857.79s]  You pull the pipe back from the hole.
[9857.79s -> 9859.63s]  The foreign is tipped with honey,
[9859.63s -> 9861.75s]  which you lick off before putting the pipe away.
[9861.75s -> 9864.28s]  A light meal, but still good.
[9864.28s -> 9866.98s]  But the now open hole has allowed the bees out
[9866.98s -> 9869.75s]  and they are quickly swarming from the totem.
[9869.75s -> 9870.59s]  What?
[9870.59s -> 9871.41s]  Finger.
[9873.82s -> 9874.82s]  Can I plug it?
[9874.82s -> 9877.21s]  All right, I'm gonna plug it.
[9877.21s -> 9878.89s]  You put your finger in the hole to block it
[9878.89s -> 9881.05s]  and are immediately stung twice.
[9881.05s -> 9883.99s]  Before you can be stung again, you take your finger out.
[9883.99s -> 9886.79s]  Put the pipe back in the hole.
[9886.79s -> 9888.91s]  You shove the pipe back in the hole,
[9888.91s -> 9891.63s]  but now you have no choice but to leave it there
[9891.63s -> 9894.60s]  or take it out and release the swarm again.
[9894.76s -> 9896.10s]  All right, take the pipe out.
[9896.10s -> 9898.10s]  You pull the pipe out of the totem's mouth.
[9898.10s -> 9899.98s]  The bees roar out an angry storm
[9899.98s -> 9906.09s]  and sting you two or three times before you can turn tail.
[9906.09s -> 9914.02s]  We're good.
[9914.02s -> 9918.26s]  Hey, I got a meal.
[9918.26s -> 9920.12s]  The road meets the riverbank.
[9920.12s -> 9922.64s]  The mid afternoon heat fills the landscape.
[9922.64s -> 9924.93s]  You're met by a cheering sight,
[9924.93s -> 9926.81s]  where once this spot held the ruined foot
[9926.81s -> 9928.17s]  of an ancient bridge.
[9928.17s -> 9932.17s]  Now a majestic stone arch rises high into the air
[9932.17s -> 9933.99s]  as it crosses the river.
[9933.99s -> 9936.11s]  A way across.
[9936.11s -> 9938.14s]  Let's get some water.
[9938.14s -> 9940.18s]  You lean out into the river and fill up the gourd.
[9940.18s -> 9944.32s]  The rushing water sprays on your boots.
[9944.32s -> 9946.10s]  Okay.
[9946.10s -> 9948.44s]  You gaze up at the impressive stone bridge.
[9948.44s -> 9950.39s]  Craftsmanship is incredible.
[9950.39s -> 9951.99s]  The whole thing seems to have been carved
[9951.99s -> 9954.88s]  from a single colossal block of stone,
[9954.88s -> 9958.15s]  perhaps from the cliff face behind itself,
[9958.15s -> 9961.56s]  and then lowered perfectly into place across the fissure.
[9961.56s -> 9966.03s]  What manner of creature would be capable of such a feat?
[9966.03s -> 9968.74s]  Climb up the bridge.
[9968.74s -> 9971.78s]  You haul your way up the first few steps of the bridge
[9971.78s -> 9974.10s]  until you're standing above the water.
[9974.10s -> 9976.22s]  The spray throws rainbows in the sunlight
[9976.22s -> 9979.86s]  across the endless grass plains on either side.
[9979.86s -> 9982.28s]  You can see for miles in either direction.
[9982.28s -> 9985.02s]  The tower to the east and the grassy plains ahead.
[9985.02s -> 9986.60s]  For the briefest moment,
[9986.60s -> 9988.88s]  the nose of a narwhal appears above the surface
[9988.88s -> 9990.02s]  of the river.
[9990.02s -> 9994.57s]  Then it is gone, dragged away by the current.
[9994.57s -> 9997.26s]  Looking north across the plains,
[9997.26s -> 9999.60s]  you see barren waste once more.
[9999.60s -> 10000.44s]  In the far distance,
[10000.44s -> 10002.48s]  a group of horses are steaming across the plain
[10002.48s -> 10003.93s]  at wild speed.
[10003.93s -> 10006.62s]  They're riders thrown from side to side.
[10006.62s -> 10011.39s]  Then in a cloud of dust, they are gone once more.
[10011.39s -> 10013.75s]  Is he enough?
[10013.75s -> 10015.29s]  Each step of the bridge would require effort
[10015.29s -> 10017.13s]  to climb otherwise the road leads away,
[10017.13s -> 10020.88s]  well-paved, to the east.
[10020.88s -> 10027.97s]  Okay, so let's cross the bridge.
[10027.97s -> 10030.18s]  The afternoon is drawing on.
[10030.18s -> 10032.16s]  You cross the bridge wary at each step
[10032.16s -> 10035.00s]  that the ancient stones will collapse underneath you.
[10035.00s -> 10036.22s]  But they hold firm.
[10036.22s -> 10039.07s]  All the way across and you reach the far side.
[10039.07s -> 10041.77s]  The grassy plains stretch away once more.
[10041.77s -> 10043.79s]  Behind you, the river roars and screams.
[10043.79s -> 10046.63s]  The mighty bridge leads back across the river from here.
[10046.63s -> 10047.83s]  You waste no time.
[10047.83s -> 10051.36s]  You must explore these fields further.
[10051.36s -> 10060.74s]  All right, we're going up here.
[10060.74s -> 10063.97s]  You walk for half an hour across the fertile grassland.
[10063.97s -> 10066.74s]  The sun begins to dip heading towards the horizon.
[10066.74s -> 10069.48s]  The road is solid flag-stoned track.
[10069.48s -> 10071.79s]  Not grand, but serviceable enough.
[10071.79s -> 10073.55s]  It is clearly frequently used by farmers,
[10073.55s -> 10075.33s]  wagons, and supply carts.
[10075.33s -> 10082.62s]  Oh, how any of those across the river is a mystery, okay?
[10082.62s -> 10085.28s]  The road curves eastwards towards the stone tower.
[10085.28s -> 10089.86s]  Smaller track winds north between clumps of trees.
[10089.86s -> 10092.59s]  That's the river, we already know what that is.
[10092.59s -> 10098.26s]  So we're going up here.
[10098.26s -> 10099.94s]  You leave the clear road and walk across
[10099.94s -> 10103.40s]  the now windswept plain the evening is drawing in.
[10103.40s -> 10105.98s]  You stride on.
[10106.02s -> 10108.98s]  All right, do I wanna go to where those fins
[10108.98s -> 10110.48s]  are working on the tower?
[10110.48s -> 10115.79s]  Or go to this kind of ruined town?
[10115.79s -> 10121.35s]  I think I can just sweep around here.
[10121.35s -> 10124.88s]  Sex, what are you guys saying, sex?
[10124.88s -> 10126.68s]  You walk on across the dusty plains
[10126.68s -> 10128.65s]  until you join an old road.
[10128.65s -> 10130.67s]  The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.
[10130.67s -> 10132.75s]  It'll be night soon.
[10132.75s -> 10136.46s]  You stop suddenly as you notice a movement in the distance.
[10136.46s -> 10139.65s]  Three shapes are approaching rapidly across the plain,
[10139.65s -> 10142.25s]  throwing up a thick cloud of dust as they move.
[10142.25s -> 10145.83s]  As you watch, they turn and head towards you.
[10145.83s -> 10148.13s]  Hail them.
[10148.13s -> 10149.81s]  There is a hand to hail the approaching figures
[10149.81s -> 10160.14s]  to discover they are tall, thick set centaurs.
[10160.14s -> 10161.78s]  Hold there, stranger.
[10161.78s -> 10164.37s]  Calls their leader, pulling himself up to a halt.
[10164.37s -> 10167.68s]  We are backlands horsemen.
[10167.68s -> 10170.45s]  Greetings, you are centaurs, not men.
[10170.45s -> 10174.33s]  I request, what?
[10174.33s -> 10177.92s]  Greetings, the centaur unslings a bow
[10177.92s -> 10180.61s]  and fires an arrow into the dirt by your feet
[10180.61s -> 10182.80s]  as a warning to come no closer.
[10182.80s -> 10187.25s]  He notches a second arrow aiming somewhat higher this time.
[10187.25s -> 10190.14s]  Now tell me, what is your purpose here
[10190.14s -> 10194.44s]  in the living misery that is Badrubak?
[10197.18s -> 10200.32s]  I'm a traveler, I'm on a mission.
[10200.32s -> 10202.75s]  I'm on a mission.
[10202.75s -> 10203.59s]  A mission?
[10205.97s -> 10208.13s]  What mission could take you out here?
[10208.13s -> 10211.53s]  There is nothing here to find.
[10211.53s -> 10219.93s]  It's a secret, shh, don't tell anybody.
[10219.93s -> 10225.13s]  These planes seem busy enough.
[10225.13s -> 10228.53s]  Just as a rotting corpse is busy with maggots,
[10228.53s -> 10230.58s]  but you are no mere traveler.
[10230.58s -> 10231.96s]  You are a sorcerer.
[10231.96s -> 10234.91s]  I'd wager my brittle on it.
[10234.91s -> 10237.43s]  The others stamp their hooves in restless agreement.
[10237.43s -> 10241.30s]  The centaur at the back of the group and goes forward.
[10241.30s -> 10243.89s]  This must be him.
[10244.77s -> 10246.84s]  He mutters, not quite enough for you to not hear.
[10246.84s -> 10252.04s]  The one the serpent spoke of.
[10252.04s -> 10253.20s]  You've spoken to the serpents?
[10253.20s -> 10255.37s]  You're mistaken, you know the serpents?
[10255.37s -> 10259.94s]  If you try to stop me, I'll kill you.
[10259.94s -> 10263.67s]  You know of the seven serpents?
[10263.67s -> 10265.38s]  You demand quickly.
[10265.38s -> 10267.24s]  These lands are ours.
[10267.24s -> 10270.33s]  Nothing crosses without our knowledge.
[10270.33s -> 10272.01s]  Except for me.
[10272.01s -> 10274.34s]  You fucking idiots.
[10274.34s -> 10276.70s]  The centaur stirs restlessly on the dust.
[10276.70s -> 10284.60s]  We know of you now, Anelander.
[10284.60s -> 10285.44s]  Hiya!
[10285.44s -> 10287.74s]  All right, perhaps we can help each other.
[10287.74s -> 10289.37s]  You suggest carefully.
[10289.41s -> 10291.75s]  I may have something you want.
[10291.75s -> 10295.86s]  The centaur raises one thick, bushy eyebrow.
[10295.86s -> 10299.09s]  And what do you suggest?
[10299.09s -> 10301.11s]  You help me and you live.
[10301.11s -> 10303.11s]  I will cast a luck spell on you.
[10303.11s -> 10303.95s]  I can pay.
[10303.95s -> 10307.17s]  Do you play swindle stones?
[10307.17s -> 10308.53s]  This is just a, this is horseshit.
[10308.53s -> 10316.54s]  Should I lie to him?
[10316.54s -> 10319.90s]  Do you play swindle stones?
[10319.90s -> 10322.88s]  Oh no.
[10322.88s -> 10326.36s]  I know the people of Kaare are happy to lose their homes
[10326.36s -> 10328.80s]  to that game, but I will not.
[10334.32s -> 10339.00s]  I will cast a luck spell on you.
[10339.00s -> 10340.45s]  A luck spell?
[10340.45s -> 10342.74s]  You have clearly piqued his interest.
[10342.74s -> 10352.08s]  And what do you want from us in return?
[10352.08s -> 10356.32s]  Tell me of the serpents.
[10356.32s -> 10357.46s]  Happily.
[10357.46s -> 10360.49s]  We tell you everything.
[10360.49s -> 10364.32s]  Every man deserves to know how he will die.
[10364.32s -> 10368.61s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[10368.61s -> 10371.88s]  That was all of them laughing in different tones.
[10371.88s -> 10376.58s]  Do you know the serpents weaknesses?
[10376.58s -> 10378.10s]  You mistake us.
[10378.10s -> 10380.38s]  We patrol these planes.
[10380.38s -> 10382.16s]  We're not wizards.
[10382.16s -> 10386.99s]  We do not know the ways of magic.
[10386.99s -> 10390.40s]  I mean, perhaps you've heard something.
[10390.40s -> 10391.74s]  Nothing.
[10391.74s -> 10393.90s]  You are on your own.
[10393.90s -> 10395.38s]  The fur of the centaur kicks the ground
[10395.38s -> 10398.52s]  and grumbles clearly unhappy that they are talking to you.
[10398.52s -> 10401.65s]  Where can I find them?
[10401.65s -> 10404.50s]  The serpents have scattered across the plane
[10404.50s -> 10408.30s]  and some are rushing to Mampang to deliver their message
[10408.30s -> 10413.42s]  while others lie in wait to hunt you down.
[10413.42s -> 10416.78s]  I need to find them all.
[10416.78s -> 10419.31s]  That might be yet possible.
[10419.31s -> 10422.02s]  The backlands are a strange place.
[10422.02s -> 10424.58s]  They shift, change.
[10424.58s -> 10427.39s]  The very earth itself is cursed.
[10427.39s -> 10429.59s]  Many who try to rush across find themselves
[10429.59s -> 10431.92s]  only turning in circles.
[10431.92s -> 10434.36s]  The serpents have crossed once before,
[10434.36s -> 10437.52s]  but they may be slow in returning.
[10437.52s -> 10440.62s]  They're looking restless.
[10440.62s -> 10441.46s]  Thank you.
[10441.46s -> 10443.37s]  You've been most helpful.
[10443.37s -> 10447.87s]  Now, the spell the centaur declares.
[10452.29s -> 10454.14s]  Yeah, I got your luck spell for you.
[10460.28s -> 10465.35s]  Create an illusion.
[10465.35s -> 10466.41s]  Gum.
[10466.41s -> 10471.26s]  Create glue.
[10471.26s -> 10472.10s]  God.
[10472.10s -> 10474.14s]  Oh, I could be like, yeah, here's your luck spell.
[10474.14s -> 10479.01s]  I am God.
[10479.01s -> 10479.85s]  Dim?
[10479.85s -> 10481.65s]  Cause stupidity.
[10481.65s -> 10483.87s]  Oh no.
[10483.87s -> 10485.46s]  Oh.
[10485.46s -> 10501.64s]  luck what this exists i don't know it though quicksand oh that's so evil i don't i don't
[10501.64s -> 10504.68s]  know it i don't i don't know it i don't actually know it i don't think i can cast it unless i
[10504.68s -> 10512.33s]  actually comprehend it right can i cast it i thought you had to comprehend it to cast it
[10514.66s -> 10524.65s]  try it consulting the constellations overhead you bind the spell and you feel a strange force
[10524.65s -> 10530.52s]  entering your bones as though you were growing stiff and you begin to shake quickly you direct
[10530.52s -> 10536.52s]  the spell's power to the centaur what a stroke of luck to have found a luck spell in this very spot
[10536.52s -> 10540.82s]  preening with satisfaction at his blessing the centaur kicks his hooves into the air
[10540.82s -> 10548.79s]  the creature smiles broadly now we are blessed you cannot hope to defeat us we will take from
[10548.79s -> 10554.36s]  you what we want the centaur wheels around to attack while the others hold back cheering and
[10554.36s -> 10563.46s]  waving their bows you have no choice but to fight what a dick all right we're going full blast big
[10563.46s -> 10572.10s]  damage big damage defend the centaur smiles with broken teeth you launch forwards hoping to take
[10572.10s -> 10580.71s]  the creature by surprise the centaur bellows and laughs turning about for a charge and you drop
[10580.71s -> 10586.39s]  into a crouch as the centaur stampede you roll to one side staggering backwards under the impact
[10586.39s -> 10597.30s]  he grumbles and stamps away he just did five i'm gonna go full blast you dummy you launch your
[10597.38s -> 10604.41s]  attack and your blade sings as it pair arts the air but the centaur is well out of reach so you
[10604.41s -> 10612.54s]  catch him with a passing blow he adjusts his harness all right you fall back the centaur paces
[10612.54s -> 10620.76s]  around you threatening but not connecting you coming in full blast full blast 6.0 no defend
[10623.30s -> 10635.88s]  shit an opening appears and you bring your blade in heavily but the centaur is racing back so you
[10635.88s -> 10642.65s]  do little more than scratch his side the centaur stamps his feet trying to shake himself into
[10642.65s -> 10652.47s]  action he wheels swiftly calling to his fellows defend you drop into a crouch as the centaur
[10652.47s -> 10656.63s]  charges at you furiously you duck his blade when it comes though it leaves you breathless for a
[10656.63s -> 10662.71s]  moment he rides some way back all right this is a defense so just do a tiny bit like 1.2 like 1.5
[10662.71s -> 10675.10s]  or something like 2.0 1.5 good all right once more you dive forwards you cut a sideways blow
[10675.10s -> 10680.58s]  but the centaur is well away from your blade careful now calls one of the others the centaur
[10680.58s -> 10698.55s]  growls at them uh this is going to be another low one right three or full blast dead you take
[10698.55s -> 10704.07s]  advantage of the centaur's aggravation to press forward and your sword moves like lightning the
[10704.07s -> 10713.11s]  centaur gives a great cry and falls to the ground a huge plume of dust oh man the second centaur
[10713.11s -> 10723.86s]  stampedes forward oh shit i gotta do this right stampedes forward i'm thinking full blast nine
[10724.50s -> 10741.45s]  nine oh i'm all right the creatures battering hooves are wearing you down
[10742.71s -> 10746.07s]  shit i have to go 4.5 all right good i caught it that was a good catch
[10749.21s -> 10757.32s]  okay he collapses backwards he races back defend he bellows with rage he's coming in hard i have
[10757.32s -> 10767.16s]  to defend i wouldn't be able to do it anyways all right you breathe a sigh of relief he draws his
[10767.16s -> 10779.24s]  bow so fast he all but fumbles an arrow all right i'm thinking like five got yep a chance opens up
[10779.24s -> 10784.04s]  swinging up from the low crouch you strike for the beast thick neck cutting into his flank you'll die
[10784.04s -> 10797.90s]  here i think he's coming full blast again full blast he has 10 stamina he just used three point
[10797.90s -> 10812.52s]  okay i'm doing it full blast he screamed you'll die here cantering away the centaur leaves a trail
[10812.52s -> 10819.30s]  of thick blood in his path he'll boil you for glue the last centaur goes his fellow god damn it i'm

[10895.74s -> 10904.39s]  stay clear of your sword spare him keep your life you declare the creature nods quickly and then
[10904.39s -> 10911.06s]  wheels around and races away the planes fall silent the two dead centaurs are bleeding quietly
[10911.06s -> 10918.62s]  into the sand the arrow fired by the centaur into the dirt is still here why spare because i was
[10918.62s -> 10925.72s]  gonna die and i was afraid to lose the next fight you tug the arrow from the dirt the shaft is as
[10925.72s -> 10933.38s]  thick as your finger the metal tip the size of a wet stone you slide it into your pack as a souvenir
[10933.38s -> 10939.11s]  there's no use letting their corpses go to waste the sands will cover them and their belongings all
[10939.11s -> 10944.65s]  too quickly rifling through their saddlebags you uncover four gold pieces a pouch of brown sand
[10944.65s -> 10952.63s]  and a sun jewel got the sun jewel back hell yeah thank god you take the jewel and slip it into your
[10952.63s -> 10961.96s]  pack then you leave the corpses for the dust and turn your back you continue on your way i'm kind
[10961.96s -> 10972.47s]  of i might just do this yeah pray for healing the ape doesn't really help that much it's good for
[10972.47s -> 10985.26s]  a heal though uh let's go up here to where the spins were working you step off the road and cut
[10985.26s -> 10992.22s]  across the desolate plain another night begins you need to rest in the dark you do not see the deep
[10992.22s -> 11003.45s]  pit in the ground until you stumble into it you land on something soft something moving from
[11003.45s -> 11010.22s]  nearby you hear a murmuring oh god you look up to the heavens but before you can find a spell
[11010.22s -> 11024.28s]  something wraps itself around your left arm a sorcerer murmurs a voice as your eyes adjust to
[11024.28s -> 11033.86s]  the dark you see you are not alone in the pit a man squats beside you with a pipe in his mouth
[11033.86s -> 11040.98s]  who are you you demand the man smiles and plays a few quick notes on his pipe suddenly the earth
[11040.98s -> 11046.90s]  below moves rearing up and you realize you have landed in a pit filled with snakes the man laughs
[11046.90s -> 11056.95s]  at your fear and soothes the beast once more with his music manata is me i'm good to travel earth
[11058.39s -> 11066.98s]  the snakes hiss and whine about their master but i am curious as to who you are you are a
[11067.78s -> 11081.05s]  traveler i'm too weak i'm too weak elegant i'm too weak elegant what are these snakes my pets
[11082.01s -> 11091.48s]  most beautiful creatures on this earth thing for them one of the vipers nips at your boot
[11091.48s -> 11103.53s]  please tell me of your travels i am weak i'm too weak i'm too weak i'm very weak i'm very weak
[11103.53s -> 11115.32s]  he nods then rest i will play for you and he begins to pipe a tune in your current state you
[11115.32s -> 11121.27s]  cannot resist it your eyes fall closed and you begin to sleep though as your eyes close you
[11121.27s -> 11127.86s]  realize your body is moving in time to the music winding and curving around the base of the pit
[11129.94s -> 11137.22s]  you dream you are sliding through long towers made of a green metal that parts as you move through
[11137.22s -> 11144.22s]  an ocean of blue shines overhead bright brittle a long tongue flickers from your mouth your body
[11144.22s -> 11153.10s]  feels infinitely long and your toes too far away to feel slowly you struggle awake you are curled
[11153.10s -> 11159.99s]  up around the snake charmer's feet amongst all his snakes but your belly feels full and you are
[11159.99s -> 11176.84s]  well rested my pretty feeling better now uh what did you do he chuckles and knocks his pipe against
[11176.84s -> 11190.49s]  his cheek um do you have any food i do not my snakes catch the food and we share the snake
[11190.49s -> 11195.77s]  charmer tips his head to one side and closes his eyes for a moment as though listening to something
[11197.59s -> 11214.07s]  i have said enough leave us kill the snake charmer ask another question do we ask a question
[11214.71s -> 11228.47s]  don't risk it just get out just i'm just gonna get out you clearly will get nothing out of the
[11228.47s -> 11233.11s]  snake charmer and scramble up out of the pit he begins to play once more as you walk away all
[11233.11s -> 11240.63s]  right he would yeah we would have got trapped i think again i mean i got food and rest whatever
[11240.63s -> 11257.34s]  okay uh all right hmm i do want to see what happened what's happening down here this is
[11257.34s -> 11263.80s]  now the dead of night the ground here is broken dry mud deep cracks and uneven surfaces make it
[11263.80s -> 11270.81s]  slow going to walk across let's look the deep fissures and layers of the mud catch your eye
[11270.81s -> 11276.65s]  it is as though the whole plane had been held high in the air and dropped it must have been
[11276.65s -> 11283.13s]  very fertile land once in a few cracks a thick clumps of grass still managed to grow you swing
[11283.13s -> 11292.63s]  your foot through one and it hits something quite solid kick harder you kick the obstacle whatever
[11292.63s -> 11301.88s]  it is and hear a definite oddly sickening crunch do i just stomp on something inside a particularly
[11301.88s -> 11311.90s]  thick clump of grass you spy something dry gray and round uh clear the grass you begin to part
[11311.90s -> 11319.91s]  the grass and reveal a familiar shape a human skull its upper jaw set into the soil it is almost
[11319.91s -> 11330.25s]  lost beneath the thick grass that grows from the top of the skull is this our friend i don't think
[11330.25s -> 11339.05s]  it's our friend because we we freed our friend let's look at it the skull appears intact no wounds
[11339.05s -> 11346.10s]  or injuries it is only lightly buried a little soil spills between the lower front teeth the eye
[11346.10s -> 11353.91s]  sockets steer through the thick green grass that cover the scalp all right let's pry the skull free
[11353.91s -> 11360.57s]  the skull is only lightly buried a good tug should pull it free you try but it does not come loose
[11362.33s -> 11370.07s]  lever the skull you draw your sword and slip it under the skull then lever hard the skull flips
[11370.07s -> 11385.18s]  up into the air with a snap and lands nearby a short bony stake is left in the ground interesting
[11389.05s -> 11406.49s]  resurrect the dead that would be cool oh well uh god illusion of worship something with a w
[11406.49s -> 11425.69s]  that i don't know why not uh the voice begins to speak to you the voice assures you there is no
[11425.69s -> 11435.59s]  danger here at all um i'm gonna keep the skull you put the skull into your pack in case it should
[11435.59s -> 11443.42s]  come in useful later though what for you cannot think okay it's not the most comfortable place
[11443.42s -> 11448.06s]  to rest especially with the body in the ground beside you but it will suffice thankfully you're
[11448.06s -> 11456.25s]  not hungry you close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you a long night is kept
[11456.25s -> 11463.03s]  busy with vivid dreams a small rabbit hops up to your feet quite tame then raises its eyes
[11463.03s -> 11470.55s]  which burn bright and terrible red with all the force of a red eye of kare a huge bird with your
[11470.55s -> 11478.18s]  face swoops down from the sky long talons raking the dusty soil digging grave after grave and all
[11478.18s -> 11492.63s]  the while you hear a distant laughter from the east oh sick all right you march onwards there's
[11492.63s -> 11505.99s]  nothing here really uh let's go wrap around here and then we'll end up at this bridge you make your
[11505.99s -> 11511.74s]  slow way across the endless plane a few clouds boil in the sky scoured into the plane here are
[11511.74s -> 11521.21s]  deep curving ruts from a creature they're almost certainly the tracks of some creature that slid
[11521.21s -> 11526.94s]  across the ground switching from side to side most likely there are the tracks of a snake but
[11526.94s -> 11531.99s]  the size is hard to comprehend each groove in the land is large enough to stand in up to the
[11531.99s -> 11540.31s]  height of your hip it must be a serpent follow the tracks you follow the curving tracks backwards and
[11540.31s -> 11545.19s]  forwards across the plane they turn a little way southwards but continue on towards the mountains
[11545.19s -> 11564.25s]  does it still work does it still work how does it sound does it still work how does it does it
[11564.25s -> 11582.89s]  sound okay it does not work does this do anything i'm turning on the effects does this do anything
[11582.89s -> 11592.95s]  does this make a difference does it sound cool the tracks give out as the ground on a foot turns
[11592.95s -> 11598.31s]  from dust to broken rocks at the foot of the eastern ridge sitting in the low rocks and
[11598.31s -> 11606.63s]  humming to himself as a dwarf over his shoulder is a cloth string bag flick him over you regard
[11606.63s -> 11613.82s]  him with interest it is strange to see a creature out here alone on the plains the dwarf peers back
[11613.82s -> 11621.61s]  and what are you he demands are you here to rob me and what's all that fish smell oh that's a bad
[11621.61s -> 11631.61s]  scottish accent but you know what fuck it who cares i have some raw fish good for you i prefer
[11631.69s -> 11639.75s]  to cook mine but then i'm not a wild dog i'm sorry as he talks he slings his bag onto his lap and
[11639.75s -> 11650.01s]  opens it from inside he removes a chunk of heavy blackened bread you want some thank you you sit
[11650.01s -> 11654.78s]  down on a rock close you know we're going to do a different dwarf we're going to do a different
[11654.78s -> 11661.83s]  dwarf um we're going to do a different kind of is it going to be a different dwarf okay thank you
[11661.83s -> 11667.00s]  you sit down on a rock close by the dwarf and he hands you a chunk of bread it is stale and dry
[11667.00s -> 11675.94s]  but still provides some nourishment to starve off the worst of your hunger uh what's your name
[11675.94s -> 11683.48s]  mist stupid name for a dwarf dwarfs have names like gutter pace not names like mist but my
[11683.48s -> 11695.43s]  parents thought that they were something different didn't they you play swindle stones taking out the
[11695.43s -> 11703.05s]  dice i'll play you all right but i won't stake anything i've got nothing to lose that seems fair

[12643.46s -> 12654.58s]  we're going down the rocks underfoot soon turn into a slope and then the slope gets steeper
[12654.58s -> 12660.14s]  until the going is hard and you are heavy breathing the sun is beginning to lower the air begins to
[12660.14s -> 12668.62s]  cool from the middle distance a curious sound reaches your ears let's listen you stop and listen
[12668.62s -> 12675.48s]  the sound is some kind of screech but quiet but close at hand but the mountainside is barren and
[12675.48s -> 12698.18s]  there's nothing that could be causing the sound let's do sus let's be safe oh my god okay reaching
[12698.18s -> 12702.82s]  up to the stars you create the magic and a steady voice enters your mind it tells you that there is
[12702.82s -> 12710.28s]  nothing to fear here but that close at hand in the mountains a serpent awaits this message
[12710.28s -> 12716.52s]  deliver this message delivered the voice fades you have barely finished the spell when something
[12716.52s -> 12723.83s]  happens a fearful shape begins to form a dark cowled creature with a skull-like head it seems
[12723.83s -> 12743.14s]  your spell somehow missed this how did you miss that it beckons with a single bony finger
[12743.22s -> 12766.06s]  run for cover in the rocks um what else can i do uh walk as a shield dim is caused stupidity
[12768.82s -> 12781.98s]  rock i don't have the stuff uh rap i could talk all languages okay the death wraith is still
[12781.98s -> 12787.75s]  groaning and laughing but somehow it seems unaffected by the spell though you strain your
[12787.75s -> 12799.27s]  ears you cannot make out any real words at all approach you approach cautiously the apparition
[12799.27s -> 12805.43s]  appears to be a death wraith like the one you fought in shinva's tomb in the kare's necropolis
[12805.43s -> 12824.26s]  as you step nearer it opens its arms wide to clasp you silver chain oh goodness okay you draw
[12824.26s -> 12829.42s]  the magic chain and wrap one end around your fist leaving the other free to whip and strike
[12829.42s -> 12843.61s]  that's a lot of stamina uh okay i'm glad i did that the death wraith drifts forward one hand
[12843.61s -> 12850.09s]  reaching for your neck the other holding a dagger aloft it howls with icy rage as it approaches
[12850.09s -> 12857.45s]  knife outstretched you gather your wits and drop into a defensive crouch you must turn you turn
[12857.45s -> 12880.70s]  the blow that you bend your back and it glances you shit come on i almost tripped over a stone
[12880.70s -> 12887.35s]  wow the death wraith drifts back across the plateau withdrawing but injured all right so
[12887.35s -> 12898.22s]  we're gonna defend okay the death wraith reaches out with its skeletal hand the wraith
[12898.22s -> 12905.38s]  cackles as you pant for breath uh i have to defend again yeah i would have gotten hit
[12908.54s -> 12913.90s]  you parry in a flash of sparks and metal all right now's my chance say like i have to do why
[12913.90s -> 12925.10s]  am i stamina so low got it oh it's because of the chain it's not the sword or the axe okay
[12926.38s -> 12931.42s]  you whip the chain and the death wraith's knife is easily turned the operation lifts a little into
[12931.42s -> 12957.48s]  the air this place will be your last yeah why is he talking now uh i gotta defend again yep okay
[12957.48s -> 12963.58s]  now i go full forward yep two more all right i'm gonna do this two more times i'm gonna go again

[12972.36s -> 12986.87s]  your skin oh come on it's gonna come in hard it curves its blade high into the air and grins its

[13010.62s -> 13016.33s]  death wraith with the chain with a final strike the creature wails and moans it begins to retreat
[13016.33s -> 13024.89s]  slowly painfully no longer floating the monster crawls a short distance away and the shimmering
[13024.89s -> 13031.82s]  haze once more returns engulfing the death wraith completely when it fades the apparition has
[13031.82s -> 13038.62s]  disappeared and in its place is a stout balding man who whimpers and nurses his wounds
[13040.70s -> 13055.78s]  let me be i mean you no harm what is the meaning of this the creature does not take his arms from
[13055.78s -> 13063.67s]  over his head leave wren friend alone he never does any harm just a little merriment that's all
[13063.67s -> 13081.19s]  behind you the apparition has vanished it was a mere illusion threaten you step closer and a
[13081.19s -> 13088.74s]  land sword poised tell me why i should spare your life answer me that of course of course

[13167.64s -> 13173.94s]  times normal speed however this spell requires the caster to sniff yellow powder before cats it is
[13173.94s -> 13183.40s]  it's cocaine all right i'm taking it you lift the vial of yellow powder to the light as you take it
[13183.40s -> 13190.90s]  there's a fine grainy powder the color of unchafed wheat or pus i'll take the disc too you take the

[13290.38s -> 13302.33s]  do you live here in the backlands looking around the wilderness they used to be a sailor my captain
[13302.33s -> 13309.88s]  was a brute we landed ashore and i ran off into the wasteland i've been wandering them ever since
[13309.88s -> 13316.06s]  this place is cursed do you know that you think you've reached the edge and then somehow you find
[13316.06s -> 13324.20s]  yourself back where you started it's like the ground itself was built in spirals yeah suddenly
[13324.20s -> 13330.34s]  the man's eyes turn upwards and his voice trails off into a low moan a moment later he has keeled
[13330.34s -> 13338.82s]  over something it seems has frightened him to death you whip around but catch sight only of
[13338.82s -> 13362.71s]  something moving up the slope of the mountain you continue up the winding path into the pass at the
[13362.71s -> 13368.73s]  top of the mountain the wind picks up as the evening draws on soon it will be dark suddenly
[13368.73s -> 13376.52s]  the sun is snuffed out like a candle a hissing sound begins to echo around the rocks and overhead
[13376.52s -> 13386.89s]  a larger moon than usual seems to rise from the horizon another trick you look up in surprise
[13388.14s -> 13395.90s]  the shape rises a little higher the strange almost translucent ball than the round shape uncoils
[13395.90s -> 13403.34s]  itself the shimmering body of the moon serpent is revealed hovering in the air above you its
[13403.34s -> 13412.89s]  wide fangs are open and it is coming for you drink it drink the snake bike snake bite antidote
[13412.89s -> 13426.76s]  light my tinderbox look at the serpent all right the moon serpent was what the moon serpent is
[13426.76s -> 13442.07s]  deathly afraid of fire okay so fire the tinderbox hot so wait am i about to just pick a lighter up

[13470.92s -> 13476.34s]  wings seem to stretch from horizon to horizon and its eyes are two yellow orbs its scales are
[13476.34s -> 13482.50s]  a mixture of circles crescents and flattened ovals and a very only slightly in shade from
[13482.50s -> 13493.13s]  flat gray to shimmering silver saliva is streaming down its teeth okay all right let's go let's do it
[13493.13s -> 13504.84s]  but i mean i could talk and well i mean is it an animal or do we just just rip the bandaid off
[13504.84s -> 13519.61s]  and throw the fireball at its face let's talk removing the green wig you pulled under your
[13519.61s -> 13532.06s]  head and complete the spell but the serpent only laughs at you stupid creature i speak your language
[13532.06s -> 13545.02s]  but why would i talk to you the creature is almost on you now all right it's time
[13553.80s -> 13562.17s]  fireball you wind the constellations into alignment around you winding a fireball in your
[13562.17s -> 13570.71s]  palm the serpent's eyes glitter in the light it does not seem scared throw it at the serpent
[13570.71s -> 13575.03s]  the flames of the burning fireball gutter as it flies through the air towards the serpent
[13575.03s -> 13581.19s]  but you score a direct hit and the fire quickly spreads across the creature's skin it seems fire
[13581.19s -> 13586.71s]  truly is the serpent's weakness one by one the scales pop from its hide peeling back and falling
[13586.71s -> 13594.87s]  like leaves to the rocks below the creature is screaming now in pain and terror what should i
[13594.87s -> 13603.29s]  kill it wait or just wait boy wait right the serpent has ceased its attack and is now lifting
[13603.29s -> 13613.24s]  into the air turning about making to run draw my sword and kill it you draw your sword ready to
[13613.24s -> 13617.88s]  finish the serpent off before it can escape the serpent darts low and you set yourself a battle
[13617.88s -> 13624.20s]  oh look at that stamina look at that stamina you're not gonna even have a chance what's that like six
[13631.48s -> 13639.42s]  oh that was close even though it is weakened you'll need your wits about you against this foe
[13639.98s -> 13645.14s]  you swing fast and high hoping to strike deep into the serpent's scaly hide the serpent stumbles
[13645.14s -> 13651.75s]  forward facing a painful arc towards you with crescent moon teeth bared silvery moons are
[13651.75s -> 13657.98s]  winking out across the creature's long back cold gathers around the edges of its mouth and this
[13657.98s -> 13666.82s]  we go full blast again and it's dead bingo done easy you press your advantage knowing only
[13666.82s -> 13673.72s]  too well this is a fight to the death you spin about blade fast and low the moon serpent's eyes
[13673.72s -> 13682.09s]  close to narrow crescents then fall dark its body seems to crumble before your eyes congratulations
[13682.09s -> 13688.41s]  you have defeated the first of the seven serpents of mampang the darkness in the sky disappears and
[13688.49s -> 13695.77s]  the sun returns as the serpent dies it seems to coil up shriveling away until all that remains
[13695.77s -> 13705.67s]  is a small crystal orb take the orb you lift the orb it is a precious artifact of great power
[13705.67s -> 13712.70s]  you put it carefully into your pack the bleak mountainside falls silent around you you feel a
[13712.70s -> 13719.42s]  new spring in your step one serpent has been defeated soon the rest will fall look around
[13719.42s -> 13725.10s]  you look around the clearing the marks of your battle with the moon serpent
[13725.10s -> 13729.93s]  are still visible in the dirt there's nothing else here except for a little stone work
[13729.93s -> 13737.56s]  by the eastern edge of the plateau the remains of a building perhaps or a ledge let's look you go
[13737.56s -> 13742.68s]  over to the ancient stone it sticks out from the rock a few fingers and breaks away only barely
[13742.68s -> 13747.88s]  distinguishable from the stone of the mountain another piece protrudes for a short distance away
[13747.88s -> 13756.86s]  whatever was here was large and beautifully wrought once but now is gone looking back west
[13756.86s -> 13763.30s]  across the plains you spy a dark smudge on the land a cloud of black dust rising from the wheels
[13763.30s -> 13769.99s]  of a great caravan of carts and horses crawling slug-like across the dust looking east you see
[13769.99s -> 13775.99s]  the plains continuing and then the edge of the forest of snatta dark and tangled somewhere
[13775.99s -> 13782.30s]  beyond is the distant glitter of lake iklala which you must somehow get across the edge of the
[13782.30s -> 13789.16s]  mountaintop ends abruptly there are a few carved stones and then a vertical drop you creep to the
[13789.16s -> 13794.44s]  edge of the plateau and peer down the drop is not vertical after all but skitters away down the
[13794.44s -> 13800.31s]  mountainside you might be able to skid down it but you couldn't walk and there would be a constant
[13800.31s -> 13812.20s]  danger of rolling time to head for lower ground one way or another we've been nothing but good
[13812.20s -> 13823.24s]  can we have a la la la la okay so that's the first serpent that is the moon serpent dead

[14013.77s -> 14022.10s]  uh voting the slope is windswept if you trudge onwards the sun is almost set and the sky has
[14022.10s -> 14027.37s]  turned a deep purple on and on you go pausing every now and again to scout out the land ahead
[14027.37s -> 14035.00s]  and suddenly you stop something is moving over the next rise approaching very fast wait and watch
[14035.00s -> 14041.10s]  you stop in the middle of the path and watch as the shape approaches it is a small two-legged
[14041.18s -> 14049.14s]  creature about half your size but it seems to be approaching at a remarkable rate
[14049.14s -> 14057.18s]  uh hail it raising a hand you hail the tiny creature as it gets close you see it as a small
[14057.18s -> 14062.70s]  gnome-like creature with dark skin and ugly features his little legs move at an incredible
[14062.70s -> 14073.80s]  rate and it helps itself along with a walking stick uh look at the stick you can't help but
[14073.80s -> 14081.77s]  notice the stick is carved into the shape of a serpent looking at the creature it's hard to
[14081.77s -> 14087.93s]  imagine anything could be so ugly its features are scrunched up as if drawn on paper that has
[14087.93s -> 14094.54s]  since been burned its hair is matted and filled with bones some used as ties and other the remains
[14094.54s -> 14099.86s]  from some creatures who have crawled in and died silently you wonder to yourself if the creature
[14099.86s -> 14113.46s]  is friend or foe have it whichever way you like it's a telepath indeed i am continues the creature
[14113.46s -> 14120.34s]  replying to a thought you did not even have time to formulate the gnome smiles do you think very
[14120.34s -> 14130.02s]  loud like shouting in a thunderstorm the remark does not make much sense i'll be your friend you
[14130.02s -> 14136.98s]  suggest very good now prove it it holds out a grubby hand expecting some kind of gift
[14139.00s -> 14145.26s]  uh you can have a coin you take out a gold piece and hand it to the creature who throws it
[14145.26s -> 14158.31s]  immediately to one side rubbishy metal if i want metal don't you think i can find my own um give
[14158.31s -> 14165.45s]  it an item you look in your pack for something you're willing to offer to the gnome i have a
[14165.45s -> 14172.74s]  shitload of these goblin tooth magic not you're not getting my chain you're not getting a giant's
[14172.74s -> 14182.23s]  tooth you're not getting the sun jewel you can have a goblin's tooth you hand over a goblin's
[14182.23s -> 14188.73s]  tooth the gnome shrugs accepting your gift thank you i suppose as the creature speaks its voice
[14188.73s -> 14193.53s]  begins to shift and change from the gruff croaking of the gnome to the softer tones of
[14193.53s -> 14201.32s]  a middle-aged woman i'll do you the favor of being honest about myself in return the creature says
[14201.32s -> 14208.54s]  and before your eyes the gnome transforms into a tall woman dressed in long purple robes who are
[14208.54s -> 14222.66s]  you i am din hold on i am dintenta wait i am dintentia dintentia of the steps others call me
[14222.66s -> 14230.90s]  the sham i was told to find you you exclaim remembering the riddle told to you by the
[14230.90s -> 14237.50s]  lord shinva in his second dying breath in the crypt of kare i was told you could help me
[14237.50s -> 14247.96s]  i am to ask you about the sleepless ram and we are well met who are you i'm a nobody
[14250.06s -> 14267.37s]  uh i am the sir i'm a sir should i be why would i say that hold on let me get this right okay no
[14267.37s -> 14278.18s]  i don't have any other really all right um i intend to i intend to kill the serpents i intend
[14278.18s -> 14285.93s]  to kill the seven serpents and she laughs many have had that intention very few know their
[14285.93s -> 14292.71s]  weaknesses but do you know them the serpents weaknesses are the most heavily guarded secrets
[14292.71s -> 14301.53s]  in the whole of man pang of course i know them or at least i know of two i would be grateful to
[14301.53s -> 14309.99s]  hear them i am certain you would know then that the air serpent has a weak body when in its
[14309.99s -> 14319.82s]  gaseous form secondly the serpent of earth must stay in touch with the ground what else do you
[14319.82s -> 14329.66s]  know i know your lack of gratitude is unbecoming and i should transform you into a toad tell me
[14329.66s -> 14338.76s]  of the sleepless ram the sleepless ram is in man pang fortress the guardian of the archmage
[14338.76s -> 14344.81s]  it is a statue of solid stone and your skill will be no match for its powers but it has a
[14344.81s -> 14352.86s]  simple weakness some kind of spell some kind of potion some kind of vulnerability a soft underbelly
[14352.86s -> 14360.25s]  perhaps or a single easily blinded eye the secret is much more simple so simple a child could use
[14360.25s -> 14372.31s]  it the sleepless ram can be sung to sleep where can i find the seven serpents one's off to hide
[14372.31s -> 14378.20s]  in the waters of lake eclala it means to pick you off as you cross but it will wait until you are
[14378.20s -> 14386.38s]  alone if you travel with the ferrymen you will most likely be safe if that's any help i don't
[14386.38s -> 14392.86s]  suppose it is what kind of sorceress are you a busy one why do you waste my time with stupid
[14392.86s -> 14401.48s]  questions she turns to leave begins to weave her spell around herself once more you wave her away
[14401.48s -> 14407.43s]  keen to continue your journey ventatia becomes an ugly creature once more and a moment later
[14407.43s -> 14414.22s]  has whisked herself away across the plains and is gone the climb is uneventful and the slopes are
[14414.22s -> 14432.86s]  silent is now marked on the map very helpful end of the stream voice yep end of the stream voice
