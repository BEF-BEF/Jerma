[5.30s -> 12.86s]  Hey, Jermashito. Oh, the misery. Jermashito forgot to get me my batteries.
[13.90s -> 27.48s]  That's what you guys are spamming. That's what we're going with today. That's what we're doing today.
[28.20s -> 50.81s]  Doing all right. I'm doing okay. Well, you know, I've been waiting for this one.
[50.81s -> 59.19s]  Yeah, we're playing Wrestling Empire today. This game, it's probably one of the hardest
[59.19s -> 63.19s]  times I've laughed at a video game in probably at least a couple of years, right?
[63.83s -> 73.51s]  We played this months back, many, many moons ago. Only this time, there's been a significant
[73.51s -> 79.67s]  amount of updates to this game, including outdoor environments. Like you can literally walk around
[79.67s -> 87.53s]  outside and like go do things. There's a general manager mode where you play the you play the owner
[87.53s -> 95.42s]  guy. You play the manager that writes the contracts. I mean, we kind of need to see how this plays up.
[95.98s -> 110.98s]  Be a manager. Oh, yeah. That's what we're doing today. We're gonna see some content that I might
[110.98s -> 126.58s]  have. I'd have missed. Yeah, I'm ready to go. You need to touch grass. How much is this game?
[127.22s -> 136.76s]  It's not expensive. It's it's very cheap. Whatever it is. Hold on one second. Yeah,
[136.76s -> 145.94s]  this is not an expensive game. It's $15. It's worth is worth it. I got to remember how to play.
[145.94s -> 150.60s]  I got to get the controls down again. We'll do that on the fly. I'll remember it.
[152.09s -> 161.21s]  I have to do the tutorial again. That's fine. Omega low. He's gonna laugh. Yeah, I'm ready to
[161.21s -> 172.58s]  go. Let's do it. Alright, so for very important to get this mouse off the goddamn screen.
[178.42s -> 186.98s]  Alright, so what we're gonna do is I have a very sad thing to tell everybody. See booking career.
[186.98s -> 193.48s]  I'm very curious. Mr. Satan is gone because I uninstalled this game and didn't do steam
[193.48s -> 203.35s]  cloud on it. So this is this is a fresh fresh playthrough. Yeah, fresh, fresh, fresh playthrough.
[203.91s -> 209.53s]  But we're making a new person anyways, making a new character anyways. So we're doing booking
[209.53s -> 216.94s]  career. I have to I have to pick somebody but we need to edit somebody. What league should I even
[216.94s -> 227.50s]  do? What league was it last time? It was Hollywood? Or was it wrestling school? I forget. You jigsaw
[227.50s -> 240.87s]  Jeremy. Where was jigsaw Jeremy? Let's do Hollywood. I have to pick somebody to change.
[243.94s -> 255.22s]  Eddie, Eddie Schwarz. I could just change Eddie. Who should I because one I have a beast. This is
[255.22s -> 261.35s]  a good one to do. Okay, we're gonna make this character. This is the remember I'm not a wrestler.
[261.91s -> 272.89s]  I am a person that books the matches. So keep that in mind. Now I can't change popularity. I'm
[272.89s -> 279.80s]  not that I wouldn't be that popular. All right. Well, first of all, let's get this right.
[279.80s -> 305.72s]  I need a better theme song here. I'm not gonna make Vince McMahon. I want to slow down. I just
[305.72s -> 318.58s]  I love this one. This is the best song that I love it. What is a little faster?
[329.40s -> 334.14s]  About all the misery. All right, we're gonna take my strength. I'm I want to I'm 80. No,
[334.94s -> 341.96s]  I'm probably like a 72 skill though. I can't even change that. I can't go higher. Why not?
[342.60s -> 357.11s]  Porn music. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I hit B. No, no, no, I this is wrong.
[358.79s -> 362.63s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I just pressed the B button to go back.
[364.70s -> 372.74s]  Just skip, skip, skip, skip, skip. I'm gonna retire. Fuck. Just go with it. I'm not gonna
[372.74s -> 382.04s]  just go with it. I want to make a character retire. I'm retired. Okay, I'm retired.
[383.90s -> 389.10s]  Eddie Schwarz. Who cares about Eddie Schwarz? It doesn't matter. I didn't I pressed the.
[389.10s -> 399.43s]  Okay, here we go. All right, Hollywood. We lost it. All right, Eddie Schwarz is here.
[400.31s -> 407.16s]  Whatever. Who cares? We'll do this one. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Well,
[407.16s -> 412.01s]  we can edit this and I'll pick this name of this character is going to be I don't know yet.
[413.98s -> 429.54s]  I'm not sure. Where is it? Where's my song? Looks like. Did he add tracks? I feel like
[429.54s -> 444.78s]  there weren't this many sounds songs earlier. Hmm. Yeah, I want to look like a total dick.
[449.14s -> 487.58s]  Ooh, slow it down. I like 90%. Okay, check the others. What the fuck?
[498.54s -> 514.97s]  I like this the most. Do it. Do it. All right. 13 is the one. This one's not bad either.
[515.61s -> 527.88s]  Oh, but what about the medieval music? Should I put it with like a knight costume?
[527.88s -> 549.35s]  Or that's the guy that owns the league. Yeah, make it like a king. There's too many good options.
[556.47s -> 586.33s]  Make it keep it hardcore, but make them a little dweeb. So you. Yes, I like the ones with lyrics.
[592.79s -> 597.19s]  I had this one. This is the old theme song. I remember this.
[606.81s -> 637.90s]  Yeah. Yeah, it's a Mario level. I think keep it hardcore as to stay. Make the owner of the
[637.90s -> 650.52s]  league. Horrible. No, I'm not doing Eldon rings right now. Nope. Nope. Nope. Make him me strong.
[652.54s -> 667.64s]  Fine. Me strong is that. Okay. Here's your me strong playthrough. Hold on.
[695.06s -> 711.62s]  This is good too though, guys. Slower. No, it's going to be 13 or 41.
[714.17s -> 740.25s]  And of course, I'm not playing Eldon ring. Why am I doing that?
[753.54s -> 758.10s]  Though actors they get for the From Software games, they're the best. I want to know more
[758.10s -> 764.38s]  of the stuff that they do. Seriously. The person that does the intro for Eldon ring, the narrator.
[764.38s -> 771.21s]  God damn it. You're so good. You are so good. Like it's unbelievably talented. That was like,
[771.21s -> 811.98s]  you're so good. I want, please tell me you're in more shit. Please. How about if you know,
[811.98s -> 830.50s]  how about if his name is just the dweeb that this is the manager? Yeah. How about I don't like Don
[830.50s -> 873.94s]  dweeb. Don dweeb. All right. How about for lighting? What's hardcore? Dark. Twilight. Dusk.
[873.94s -> 881.64s]  Definitely doesn't. Fireworks. All the works. Barbed bat. Baseball bat. Beer bottle. Bell.
[881.64s -> 887.96s]  Grass knuckles. Briefcase. Brim. Burger. Page piece. Camera. Pain. Cardboard. Oh my God.
[889.53s -> 896.50s]  Extinguisher. Glass pane. Guitar. Gun. Wait, there's a gun? They added a gun?
[899.26s -> 919.93s]  Hot dog. Picture? There's so much stuff now. A water bottle. He comes out with an orange.
[919.93s -> 939.96s]  What a dweeb. Okay. Popularity. What? Oh, okay. Sorry. Very unpopular, I would say.
[942.81s -> 947.05s]  Not very strong at all, but I'm the one booking the events. It doesn't matter. I'm pretty highly
[947.05s -> 959.11s]  skilled. Agility is pretty high. His damage is very low. Attitude is terrible. Okay. All right.
[959.11s -> 974.34s]  Now we're going to do the build. I think we're like 50? 55? Five? Oh boy. Should Don dweeb be
[974.34s -> 990.31s]  four foot six? How tall should Don dweeb be? This song really just pumps me the fuck up. It does.
[991.19s -> 1010.44s]  All right. How about like five? Five feet tall. Five like six. This is not a wrestler, guys. This
[1010.44s -> 1032.06s]  is Don dweeb, who is a general manager. All right. Hair. Hairstyle. Okay. It's already kind of there.
[1032.70s -> 1071.18s]  Well, I need a dweeb haircut. What is variation? No. This guy sucks. That's not bad. Am I going
[1071.18s -> 1088.28s]  to have a little hair on top? Do balding mullet. No, I think this is fine. This is fine. Somebody
[1088.28s -> 1107.06s]  said shit on his head. Okay. What about the color? I don't want his hair to be purple.
[1107.70s -> 1125.10s]  Now it's like green. Whatever. That's better. All right. I need face. Oh man. Do I have to press
[1125.10s -> 1150.47s]  any more buttons? Perfect. Not yet. Hold on. It's not perfect yet. What a fucking loser.
[1150.47s -> 1158.07s]  You don't know that. I like this one a lot. It just looks so funny.
[1162.74s -> 1176.12s]  This dude sucks. Oh, perfect. I like that more than anything.
[1179.70s -> 1197.78s]  He's just a hello neighbor guy. Glasses or a hat? No. No, I just think like this.
[1198.42s -> 1218.68s]  Okay. That looks all right so far. Let's keep going. Body. Is he like chest hair? Hold on. Can
[1218.68s -> 1230.66s]  I have just chest hair? Please let me just have just chest hair with an open shirt. Come on. Come
[1230.66s -> 1249.45s]  on. I can kind of do it. Please give him a fedora and glasses. Oh man. Make material zero.
[1253.91s -> 1260.20s]  There is no zero. Shit. It's okay. I think it blends in. That's fine. All right. Under pattern.
[1260.20s -> 1278.31s]  We got to do over pattern. Oh no. Nope. I don't think it's going to work. That one kind of worked.
[1282.26s -> 1289.62s]  Do we really care about what Don Dweeb has on? Does anybody actually care about what Don Dweeb's
[1289.62s -> 1325.05s]  attire is? Is there a long sleeve shirt? This is fucking weird. You just made Saxton Hale.
[1325.05s -> 1332.94s]  I kind of did. What is this material thing? How do I add a shirt?
[1338.44s -> 1344.28s]  What's happening with this? I mean, I kind of, I, how do I, what's going on with his shirt?
[1349.46s -> 1364.58s]  Oh, you have to, okay. You add sleeves. Okay. He looks just weird now. No elbow pads.
[1370.90s -> 1381.14s]  Uh, no gloves either. Shape. Uh, tight is fine. All right. Now let me go fix this body.
[1386.73s -> 1393.69s]  Way better. All right. Much better. We're going to make the, uh, suit gray.
[1394.25s -> 1413.98s]  Give him a beer gut, please. We'll, we'll fix it. All right. Let's do the, uh, sleeves. How do I get
[1413.98s -> 1422.66s]  this right? There we go. Okay. This is a cyborg goofy looking ass. I, I don't know what you,
[1422.66s -> 1426.26s]  what are you talking about? He looks fine. I just, this pants have to be fixed.
[1428.63s -> 1432.31s]  Why does he have prosthetic arms? He doesn't have, he, this is a suit. He's,
[1433.19s -> 1438.60s]  he does kind of look like it. Why does Don Dweeb have such a huge bulge?
[1445.64s -> 1465.10s]  I didn't say it. You did. Okay. Here we go. Let's do it. Uh, legs. That looks good. I don't think
[1465.10s -> 1478.47s]  I need no pattern. Okay. I don't think Don Dweeb would have these on. Right there. The laces go
[1478.47s -> 1485.93s]  all the way. He doesn't even have the, he looks like the snack cake thing. What are those things
[1485.93s -> 1498.04s]  called? Dung? What are they called? They're called something. Ohos? Yeah. Little Debbie's. Yeah.
[1498.04s -> 1507.53s]  All right. That looks fine. I don't want to, I don't want this to be green.
[1507.53s -> 1521.62s]  Better. Less green or red. Brown. Yeah. It's fine. All right. These green jeans. You gotta go.
[1525.08s -> 1536.38s]  These, uh, all right. Fine. My soul is leaving my body. Why? All right. That's his wrestling
[1536.38s -> 1546.02s]  attire. Casual. I think I'm okay with casual. All right. That looks good. Looks good. All right.
[1546.02s -> 1556.26s]  Moves. God. We've got stance. Missed up. Missed low. Martial arts. Grapple.
[1558.90s -> 1578.73s]  I like that. These are taunts. This is weird. Oh, that's entrance. That's entrance.
[1579.53s -> 1602.87s]  Yeah. He's just like, I'm the puppet master. It's not Costanza. Yeah. I'm thinking about something.
[1603.27s -> 1618.90s]  All right. Raise the roof. Raise finger. How about roar? Yep. Celebration. I don't know what
[1618.90s -> 1631.99s]  he's doing. Yeah. Constant disappointment. Our stance, you guys said? Yeah. Without a doubt.
[1632.71s -> 1648.17s]  All right. Attacks. Upper attack. We got right hook. I like the straight jabs. Chin kick for sure.
[1648.89s -> 1662.04s]  Do I, do I even fight anybody? I'm the manager, aren't I? I'm like the general manager of the
[1662.04s -> 1679.22s]  league. I don't think I even do anything. That just hurts. Fine. Super punch. All right. Those,
[1679.22s -> 1692.73s]  the rest of these are fine, I think. That was a magic harp attack. This is from the top rope.
[1692.73s -> 1712.62s]  Okay. Why is he holding? Okay. Why is he holding his, he's holding his pants up. Did I not give
[1712.62s -> 1730.76s]  him a belt? This guy, he's going to be fine. All of his moves are just falling down. This guy's
[1730.76s -> 1745.70s]  going to get really hurt. Okay. Crushes. Definitely kick. Definitely leg drop. Flying crush. Yep.
[1745.70s -> 1752.62s]  Just land on his spine. Anything that has him land on his back, I'm going to do. Let's see if I can
[1752.62s -> 1764.98s]  get this guy injured and retire him immediately. Okay. Good. All right. These are the ones that
[1764.98s -> 1771.82s]  really, really matter. All right. Attack and up. So these ones are okay. I don't need to change
[1771.82s -> 1776.87s]  these ones. It's the specials that I care about the most. All right. What is Don Dweeb's special
[1776.87s -> 1791.50s]  move? That's a really good question. What should it be? How about a stunner? I love the stunner.
[1791.50s -> 1804.04s]  It's like my favorite move ever. I could watch stunner, stone cold stunner compilations and I
[1804.04s -> 1808.52s]  wouldn't get sick of it. It's like, it's like a lot of people's pizza. Like, oh, I can eat pizza
[1808.52s -> 1824.04s]  every day. I could watch people get stunned every day. Rope toss. Tombstone's pretty good.
[1824.12s -> 1852.47s]  Hold on to this. Yep. Climb buster. Spear's good too. MDKO? It can't be that, right?
[1853.51s -> 1871.26s]  What if it was just a hip toss? How fucking lame. What a dweeb. If your special move is a hip toss.
[1871.82s -> 1900.10s]  Oh my god. How about head stomp? Go, go, plotter. Nice. Diamond cutter. Death valley driver.
[1900.66s -> 1915.45s]  Close line drop. Canadian destroyer. That's, yeah. I don't need to see anymore. All right.
[1915.45s -> 1923.83s]  These ones are okay. Usually I can keep these ones normal. What about these ones? I like the
[1923.83s -> 1938.36s]  neck breaker. A big fan of filler moves which are, what the hell was that? I like that one.
[1938.36s -> 1953.88s]  He has to have a hip toss. Air crash. Yep. Run and up. I like it. Headbutt. I like it.
[1956.84s -> 1971.21s]  Northern lights. Power stunner. Oh yeah. And fireman suplex. That looks good to me. All right.
[1971.21s -> 1985.13s]  What about rear moves? Yep. Bull nelson. Absolutely. Sleeper hold. Absolutely. That's such a boomer
[1985.13s -> 1991.85s]  wrestling move. You know what I mean? Oh no. He's got him in the sleeper hold. Of course Don Dweeb
[1991.85s -> 2004.49s]  would have that move. That's good. Shoulder lift. I never liked those moves because they just pin
[2004.49s -> 2016.92s]  and they're not powerful. We're doing reverse DDT. No. I want moves that hurt people. I don't
[2016.92s -> 2034.57s]  need to change that one. Just, just choking. All of his moves should just be choking people.
[2039.42s -> 2055.98s]  Recliner. Vice grip. Okay. Yeah. That looks good. I'm happy with this. All right. But anything else
[2055.98s -> 2065.67s]  I need to do? Relations. I don't really roll. This is a, this is a booker and heal. That's fine.
[2065.67s -> 2072.28s]  Promotion will stay in Hollywood. I don't need to have any friends. Is this the first time you're
[2072.28s -> 2076.20s]  playing this? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, you're not a random chatter. That's bark
[2076.20s -> 2081.88s]  skeletal. That's Joel. I was supposed to be like, excuse me. No, I've, of course I played it before.
[2081.88s -> 2090.94s]  Random chatter. That was Joel. I was supposed to like correct you. Like, um, excuse me. Of course
[2090.94s -> 2098.98s]  I've played it before. What are you, what are you dumb? No, I have played it before. This game is
[2098.98s -> 2108.52s]  fucking amazing. It's toxic. Hope you've been good. Hope you've been good too.
[2110.20s -> 2117.16s]  We got to fucking do something. Let's do something. You want to hang out like soon. What are you doing
[2117.16s -> 2122.54s]  this weekend? I'm going to play like, you want to play halo this weekend on insane difficulty
[2124.22s -> 2129.98s]  and then die in the first 10 seconds, a hundred times and not talk to each other for a year and
[2129.98s -> 2141.35s]  a half straight. That's not true. That's not true. No, let's do something, man. I, I, it's been too
[2141.35s -> 2154.26s]  long. Let's do something. I mean it. All right. Don Dweeb. There it is. I'm ready. Stop with the
[2154.26s -> 2165.46s]  networking. What Joel and I have been buddies for like five years. So excuse me. I need you to take
[2165.46s -> 2175.00s]  a quick step back and understand Joel's been around for a long time. You serious? Here we go.
[2175.00s -> 2193.64s]  Booking career going to Hollywood is Don Dweeb. I'm ready. Yep. We're good to go. Welcome to
[2193.64s -> 2198.78s]  Wrestling Revolution, Don Dweeb. I understand you'll be taking over as the Booker. You got banned?
[2202.12s -> 2205.32s]  Wrestling is currently in the worst brand of wrestling with a rating of 70%.
[2205.96s -> 2212.63s]  What? You've been brought in to turn that around and make Wrestling Revolution a viable brand.
[2216.34s -> 2220.82s]  Is $40,500 available to invest in the talent you need to get the job done? Well, we aren't
[2220.82s -> 2225.69s]  fucking going anywhere. That's all the money you're giving me? Although I'm stepping down
[2225.69s -> 2232.74s]  as the Booker, I remain the owner and will be checking you don't screw things up. But ultimately
[2232.74s -> 2240.20s]  we're on the same side and we all want Wrestling Revolution to succeed, right? I wish you the best
[2240.20s -> 2249.67s]  of luck and hope you enjoy running the show as much as I did. Okay. So this is the, here it is.
[2250.23s -> 2267.64s]  It's a TV taping in Scandinavia. How much money is this costing? Map? What? We love promos. We hate
[2267.64s -> 2277.90s]  botches. Wait, what is this map? We love weapons. We hate feuds. We love ticket prices. We hate
[2278.46s -> 2286.66s]  what? We, oh god, I'm realizing this is a map of the world. Okay. All right.
[2287.94s -> 2295.93s]  We love tickets. We, we love pro, why can I, with a whole world? We hate vene, what the fuck is
[2295.93s -> 2306.81s]  happening? We love cages. We hate intruders. We hate managers. We love time limits. We hate near,
[2306.81s -> 2316.94s]  what does Canada hate? Watches? They love holds. We love furniture. We hate countouts. We love
[2316.94s -> 2325.11s]  high flyers. We hate, that's a Carrera? Is that like a wrestler? We love furniture.
[2325.11s -> 2336.20s]  We hate weapons. We love high flyers. All right. So where are we going? We're in, where are we?
[2336.20s -> 2347.13s]  Where are we? Okay. So where's my, is my card? Okay. Undercard. All right. I gotta plan this.
[2347.13s -> 2355.93s]  Did you go to Antarctica? All right. The rules, this is fine. The first, where, where, what is,
[2355.93s -> 2365.10s]  what is Scandinavia like? It's just changing what they like, right? Where the fuck is Scandinavia?
[2365.10s -> 2378.58s]  Okay. We love promos. So mid card, we're going to have a promo script. Uh, promo. All right.
[2378.58s -> 2389.19s]  Announcement. And it's going to be a, uh, face turn. That sounds good to me. Cast is fine.
[2391.90s -> 2396.62s]  Oops. Well, whatever. That's okay. That's okay. It could just be an announcement.
[2396.62s -> 2406.41s]  Is this all that I have for the mid card? Oh shit. Oh, there's no ref. I keep deleting people.
[2406.41s -> 2409.61s]  What about the, all right. What about, what's the under, why is there only one thing?
[2411.93s -> 2418.94s]  This is every, this is the whole thing. The entire event is just this guy. It makes an announcement
[2418.94s -> 2430.68s]  and the event stops. That's actually kind of funny. Okay. Arena crowds, 1400 lighting fog.
[2431.64s -> 2441.54s]  Okay. Rules, individuals, you have to make it and then play the matches. Oh, okay.
[2441.54s -> 2448.17s]  So this is just the one match that's happening here, right?
[2449.05s -> 2460.44s]  Does that be a furniture smash? That's fine. Yeah. Elimination. No time limit.
[2461.64s -> 2470.41s]  All right. Yeah. Hardcore. Cast is going to be, you're fine. That could be whack axe. Oh,
[2470.41s -> 2476.17s]  it's okay. I see how it works. You have to actually move this around. All right. Let me get rid of you.
[2477.05s -> 2485.32s]  Um, how do I add them? What's going on? How do I add a wrestler on the other side?
[2485.88s -> 2500.62s]  I can't, how do I move this? Press Y. Okay. So they're in different teams, right? Okay.
[2500.62s -> 2505.48s]  And the script is announcement face turn. That sounds good. It doesn't matter who it is.
[2507.78s -> 2513.48s]  So is that, is that it? Can I change the other? Is this, this, this, this is just it?
[2514.52s -> 2520.12s]  Is the, I'm the undercard. All these matches are the exact same match. How do I add it?
[2522.12s -> 2537.30s]  There's no rep. How do I add a ref? Um, this menu is kind of freaking me out here.
[2537.30s -> 2559.05s]  Ref. No refs, no rules. How do I add a referee? Um, can I, how do I change this?
[2560.55s -> 2565.78s]  Go to the middle and add. Yeah. That's what I'm doing. Haven't you played this? Yeah. But I mean,
[2565.78s -> 2573.37s]  this, I haven't done like much in this menu. You have to add someone and give them the ref
[2573.37s -> 2597.02s]  role. Okay. Um, so how about you script rules? Uh, what the fuck? I don't think I can do that.
[2600.01s -> 2609.46s]  Okay. Well, I, I just need to do this because you have to add someone with a gray name. Wait,
[2609.46s -> 2623.21s]  I have to play the match too. I thought I can't just watch it. Oh, Tony land. Uh, what?
[2624.97s -> 2628.63s]  All right. Well, I, I'm just going to, I'm going to play the match. I don't,
[2631.86s -> 2643.26s]  this is very confusing. Who should I play as? Ray is retired. All right.
[2645.34s -> 2654.23s]  Drag them to the middle. I'm on a controller. Um, I'm just going to see what happens when I do this.
[2668.42s -> 2677.67s]  Is this me? No. Don't Thanos snap the ref next time. I mean, it was very easy to accidentally
[2677.67s -> 2691.34s]  delete somebody. All right. This is me apparently, but I thought I was the Booker. Okay. I remember,
[2691.34s -> 2703.42s]  I remember, I remember. Listen up everybody. There's something I need to get off my chest
[2703.42s -> 2712.41s]  before we go any further. I know I've been a jerk in recent times. I've said and done some things
[2712.41s -> 2719.50s]  I'm not proud of, but I realized we're nothing without the support of the fans. You're the
[2719.50s -> 2725.35s]  electricity that gives us life. This guy's going for the back of the head with your help. I know
[2725.35s -> 2733.58s]  I can be a better wrestler. I hope I can repay you by fulfilling my potential. We're done with the
[2733.58s -> 2744.17s]  life changing crap. The only drama that matters is in the ring. What's going on? Oh, that wasn't
[2744.17s -> 2761.34s]  very fair. There's no ref. How are we supposed to do this? All right. Let's go. You have to fight
[2761.34s -> 2768.30s]  until the death. You deleted the ref. Well, I'm sorry. If it's as it's, if it's so easy to
[2768.30s -> 2782.52s]  delete a ref, it should be easy to put a ref back in. Yeah. There's a new UI too. Who says who's
[2782.52s -> 2795.03s]  Batman over here? All right. I think I got to remember how to do this. Is it a camera? Wait,
[2795.03s -> 2806.15s]  they don't want to fight anymore. I got to remember grapple is okay. There we go. I remember
[2806.87s -> 2827.26s]  your ratings are going to go from seven to zero. How do we end the match? I don't understand.
[2827.26s -> 2838.66s]  Does somebody actually have to like go to zero? Oh my fucking God. I was going to kick this shit
[2838.66s -> 2863.45s]  out of this guy's chair. There are no rules. Give me, give me, give me, give me. Yeah. Honestly,
[2863.45s -> 2868.23s]  I probably want to start another career. I mean, I, we're not going to get attached to any of these
[2868.23s -> 2876.84s]  characters. What are you going? You're not going to the top row. What are you doing? Get the fuck
[2876.84s -> 2887.96s]  out of here. All right. There we go. We're not going to get attached to anybody. What do you mean
[2887.96s -> 2901.86s]  too late? You're not attached to this character yet. Oh my God. I'm going to die. Read the PDF.
[2902.42s -> 2927.06s]  Oh God. Out of the chair. So I forget how you pen. Here's the manual. Good luck. Oh God.
[2931.93s -> 2955.00s]  Should I open the manual? Why is he pissed? I didn't even mean to do that. Tony. I'm sorry,
[2955.00s -> 2965.62s]  Tony land. I didn't mean to do that, but I did mean to do this. I want nothing to do with this.
[2966.18s -> 2982.66s]  All right. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I do. I do want to
[2982.66s -> 2996.86s]  remember how to play and I do want to hit Batman in the head with something. This dude's supposed
[2996.86s -> 3004.70s]  to be a face. We're fighting for this guy's amusement right now, by the way. He's sitting
[3004.70s -> 3031.50s]  there like, yes. Yes. Kill it for my amusement. Get out of here. Come on. He looks like he's
[3031.50s -> 3048.01s]  wearing an American flag diaper. All right. It's just somebody pin somebody. Wasn't this a specific
[3048.01s -> 3056.06s]  match? I forget what this match even was. I just hit myself in the head with the chair.
[3057.26s -> 3062.70s]  No cheering silence. Yeah. Cause this, like this, nobody likes this league. Didn't, didn't he say
[3062.70s -> 3079.00s]  this league sucks or something? I won. All right. Maybe both progress is being hindered by the
[3079.00s -> 3085.64s]  limitations of wrestling revolution. It Bob Orson's profile suffered after losing that match.
[3087.75s -> 3093.75s]  This is Don Dweeb. I'm not sure there are work. Things are working out for me at wrestling
[3093.75s -> 3101.42s]  revolution. I know I still have 38 weeks left on my contract, but how would you feel if we
[3101.42s -> 3114.98s]  terminated our agreement? No, see out your contract. Sorry. I knew it was too much to
[3114.98s -> 3124.38s]  ask. Let's see if we can turn things around. 38 weeks. All right. Hardcore furniture mash
[3126.71s -> 3133.70s]  baby bowl versus big Bob Orson just happened. So this now is a mid card. I think I'm starting
[3133.70s -> 3140.09s]  to get the hang of this. I don't delete the referee under any circumstance. Last laugh.
[3140.73s -> 3150.22s]  Oh, last man standing street fight. Please look at the guide, remove the referee, read the manual.
[3150.86s -> 3155.77s]  Let me, let me just take a quick look at it at home. Re-Rome is only in wrestler career.
[3155.77s -> 3175.64s]  This mode may be too complicated for you to start with. Shit. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay.
[3175.64s -> 3207.93s]  Where's Don Dweeb? Time for Don Dweeb's wrestling career. You tanked the company by not reading the
[3207.93s -> 3219.30s]  manual. Let's see what, let's see what we can do with Don Dweeb. All right. I'm in wrestling
[3219.30s -> 3225.86s]  revolution. This is singles match versus mid winter at 8 PM. The gimmick. Okay. Database.
[3225.86s -> 3236.38s]  Let's go. Proceed. Rome. See, you've decided to take responsibility for what happens behind
[3236.38s -> 3242.84s]  the scenes Don Dweeb. You didn't read the goddamn manual. You lost your job in 15 minutes. If you
[3242.84s -> 3247.16s]  take this route, it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time for your match.
[3247.16s -> 3255.42s]  But only enter when your time is lit up green as Amber means somebody else's match is taking place.
[3256.66s -> 3265.37s]  What? Spend your energy on the right things at the right time to stay healthy. This world
[3265.37s -> 3269.37s]  is full of distractions, but try to make sure you get a good night's sleep at a sensible time.
[3272.70s -> 3276.06s]  You must also look after your mental health along the way as I've seen a lot of wrestlers lose
[3276.06s -> 3282.68s]  control. I got five grand. I don't want to spoil all the surprises so just get out there and see
[3282.68s -> 3290.68s]  what the city has in store for you. Now this is what I wanted to do. You can always opt out and
[3290.68s -> 3302.60s]  skip straight to the action at any time. Who is he talking to? Jerk Hoffman? Why does Jerk
[3302.60s -> 3307.56s]  Hoffman have no health? Why is there a grenade? Why is there a fucking dynamo? Why is he so mad?
[3308.52s -> 3327.29s]  What's wrong with this guy? I'm waiting for my match? Okay. So where do I go? What should I do?
[3332.52s -> 3340.22s]  I'm on the street? Wait, don't I have a match soon? Why is everybody just walking around the street?
[3342.07s -> 3347.03s]  This is the whole roster. Don't let anybody scare you out of taking this route. There are risks,
[3347.03s -> 3352.95s]  but it can also be more fulfilling. He's talking to me? I gotta get this on camera. Just try to stay
[3352.95s -> 3355.67s]  out of trouble to protect yourself, and if you can't do that, I still have your back.
[3356.84s -> 3363.48s]  All right. Why does everybody have a microphone out here?
[3364.12s -> 3379.96s]  What? Why is it... Why is the show starting? Everybody... We gotta get in there and be on camera.
[3380.52s -> 3397.14s]  Get out of my way. I'm tougher than you, Don Dweeb. Why would they put us all outside? I don't
[3397.14s -> 3414.18s]  understand. Get him off me. Somebody get him off me, please. Get out of the way. Get him off of me.
[3414.18s -> 3423.42s]  He's still on me. He's breaking my ankle. Somebody help. Help, please.
[3424.38s -> 3433.32s]  I gotta get in there. My match is starting. Backstage. All right. Where's the arena?
[3434.84s -> 3442.49s]  My health is zero. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. God damn it. I'm coming.
[3442.49s -> 3468.23s]  I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm here. Here I am. What am I fighting? What's going... What's happening?
[3468.23s -> 3474.20s]  Drop it? What do I have? What team am I on? I didn't pay attention to whose team I was on.
[3474.76s -> 3480.01s]  Am I a manager? What's going on?
[3493.66s -> 3499.67s]  These people here. They just got us outside. We're just like fucking like rats in the city.
[3500.39s -> 3509.16s]  Why is somebody at a desk? There are just a bunch of random people here. Why is it just some lady
[3509.16s -> 3524.74s]  at a desk here? She's not commentating. Oh my god. Get off of me. Please don't tap out. All right.
[3524.74s -> 3538.44s]  I'm good. All right. Who am I? I have no health. Why do we just have a brawl outside for no reason?
[3539.40s -> 3543.08s]  It said here comes the show. The show is starting and everybody freaked the fuck out.
[3543.64s -> 3566.06s]  What's going on? What? I'm crawling. How is this not illegal? This apparently isn't illegal.
[3569.70s -> 3573.14s]  Why are there two people in the ring at the same time with me? This is unfair.
[3573.94s -> 3601.03s]  Okay. Can I please? I get one second. Okay. Let's go. Oh my fucking god. Please. You gotta be ready
[3601.03s -> 3608.52s]  for your match. That's so funny. What happens if you have no health though? I can't move. My
[3608.52s -> 3623.46s]  character's just stunned. I gotta get out of here. What? Will everybody leave me alone for a second?
[3623.46s -> 3629.11s]  Everyone's just out to get me. Did I really fuck up that bad as the booker? Does everybody just hate
[3629.19s -> 3647.42s]  my guts? You have no idea. There's no reason for that. Yeah, there was. What are you doing here?
[3652.34s -> 3662.84s]  Can I see the match details? I'm fighting mid winter. That's what's going on. I have no idea
[3662.84s -> 3695.14s]  who the fuck these other people are. He's not. What? All right. Now I understand what's going on.
[3695.22s -> 3701.46s]  I can at least pretend like I know what I'm doing. Oh, that's great. You leave here with
[3701.46s -> 3707.30s]  you a group of seven fucking wrestlers that were all out here at the same time together
[3707.30s -> 3716.23s]  on the same team. That was some dweeb. I was here alone apparently. Why did you get that many people?
[3717.03s -> 3727.64s]  Am I supposed to leave the ring? I can't even get up. What's he doing? I can't move.
[3734.02s -> 3743.35s]  What? It's what's my dust? I gotta get out of the ring. Oh shit. It's not my match anymore. All
[3743.35s -> 3766.90s]  right. I gotta go. Come on. Hurry up. How do I get health back? Don Dweeb's profile suffered
[3766.90s -> 3776.98s]  after losing that match. What about people with 10 versus one? Give me a break. Oh, a special has
[3776.98s -> 3792.33s]  generated a buzz by interfering in that match. He had to shit my pants walk. I mean, you get beat up
[3792.33s -> 3805.94s]  by eight people. I didn't make any money. I lost $450. Hold on a minute. You're trying to tell me
[3805.94s -> 3814.09s]  that a ladder that was backstage that I picked up on the ground cost me $200 to bring it out to the
[3814.09s -> 3822.73s]  ring. Just put it. I don't want this anymore. All right. I gotta heal. Can I see the map somehow?
[3824.63s -> 3832.01s]  All right. Office. I gotta go bathroom. I'm glad midwinter could teach you a lesson. You don't
[3832.01s -> 3856.44s]  belong at wrestling revolution. Don Dweeb. Wait, what? I have to face $700 in damages?
[3858.42s -> 3862.82s]  I just went out there and got my ass kicked for 15 minutes. I didn't do any. What are you talking
[3862.82s -> 3887.42s]  about? What? Oh my God. What the hell? This is so fucked up. All right. I need to go to the bathroom.
[3887.98s -> 3893.54s]  Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me.
[3893.54s -> 3896.66s]  Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. You're walking at me with a bottle. Please don't hurt
[3896.66s -> 3915.05s]  me. Please don't hurt me. That guy was almost late to his match to see that. Let that be the end of
[3915.05s -> 3926.86s]  it Dweeb. I hope you've learned your lesson. Where am I going? I'm not controlling the character
[3926.86s -> 3937.48s]  right now. I'm not controlling you. You're in no state to. If you can't save your energy for the
[3937.48s -> 3947.88s]  ring, then I'll just have to keep you out of it. What do I do? All right. I have to looks like you
[3947.88s -> 3951.00s]  lost control for a while there. You need to look after your mental. What do you think?
[3951.40s -> 3956.89s]  Honestly, I haven't had one second myself. My popularity is dwindling. Please get...
[3956.89s -> 3961.85s]  What? How am I supposed to do anything when everybody just attacks me? What the fuck do you
[3961.85s -> 3981.99s]  want me to do? Oh, I wonder. I wonder. Please. This is the... That's the promoter. The promoter.
[3981.99s -> 3991.93s]  That's my boss. Oh, my fucking chest. I just need to get to another door. I can't run. I need to go
[3991.93s -> 3998.23s]  to the bathroom. Please. People are throwing weights at me. Everyone's trying to kill me.
[4000.12s -> 4005.72s]  Oh, my God. I popped when you used that ladder piece as a weapon. Remind me to never get on
[4005.72s -> 4015.46s]  your bad side. Can we be friends? Can we be friends? Can you help? Honestly. Can the three
[4015.46s -> 4020.98s]  of us work together or something? Can we be friends? Yes. Oh, my God. Please help me.
[4022.54s -> 4048.17s]  Thank God. All right. I don't know. How do I close the door? Oh, my fucking God. I'm the only idiot
[4048.17s -> 4054.06s]  that can, like, trip and fall and hurt... What the fuck is going on? Whose phone is that?
[4055.61s -> 4062.10s]  Whose phone is ringing? Is that my phone? Is there a telephone ringing in the bathroom?
[4062.74s -> 4096.25s]  How do I answer the phone? I don't... Okay. That was a good first day. Okay.
[4096.33s -> 4101.90s]  Okay. Boomtown's agility's improved. People's salary's risen.
[4105.59s -> 4109.35s]  Seven hours of uncomfortable sleep. Don Dweeb's energy levels are now at 30%.
[4114.36s -> 4127.32s]  Okay. No show today. Rome. Okay. Thank you. I need to eat some food or something. There's
[4127.32s -> 4136.52s]  nothing scheduled today. Wait. Oh, hey, what's up? I'm so glad I have one friend. I think there's a
[4136.52s -> 4148.94s]  phone in here. That's the phone right there. See the phone on the ground? I got it. Okay. What if
[4148.94s -> 4171.32s]  it rings? Anybody there? Okay. Let's go. I'm going to go out here. Go to the gym. Let me look at the
[4171.32s -> 4179.54s]  map. I need food. Barbershop. Studio. Hotel. Office. Cemetery. Airport. Hospital. All right.
[4179.54s -> 4185.37s]  Where's the hospital? It's connected to the gym. Nobody wins their first match at Wrestling
[4185.37s -> 4193.02s]  Revolution. Don Dweeb. Try not to worry about it. Thanks. Is that your buddy right there?
[4193.02s -> 4208.46s]  I'm gonna fuck off. We're gonna get out of here. Apple. How do I eat it? I said to eat the random
[4208.46s -> 4220.36s]  food that's on the ground. And you know, I didn't have any scraps in here for me. Is this corn in
[4220.36s -> 4251.43s]  the cob? Please leave me alone. What a weirdo. All right. Go, go, go. Hospital. Okay. You never
[4251.43s -> 4256.89s]  should have taken this step, Don Dweeb. You don't have what it takes to survive in the real world.
[4256.89s -> 4262.18s]  If you want to be escorted to the ring safely, just admit you made a mistake and back out.
[4266.14s -> 4271.37s]  Why are you here? I don't want this. I need to... Where's the hospital? Wait, there's a hamburger
[4271.37s -> 4276.02s]  on the ground. All right. If you really want to do this, then... This is the doctor. He's not treating
[4276.02s -> 4288.15s]  me. How do I get treated by the doctor? That person just fell out of the bed. You all right?
[4288.15s -> 4318.65s]  Phone. Hello? I was hoping to speak to Machine Murray. What the fuck is happening in here?
[4318.65s -> 4328.39s]  Let me just eat all the trash off his ground. Stop. Please. Okay. Well, I guess I can't get
[4328.39s -> 4334.52s]  treated from the doctor who's trying... You know what? I'm fucking sick of this guy. I'm sick and
[4334.52s -> 4351.48s]  tired of your shit. You understand? Where do you keep the medicine? What? This guy attacked me when
[4351.48s -> 4362.23s]  I came in here. You attacked me. That's what happened. I mean, I found it on the ground.
[4363.82s -> 4373.00s]  Yeah. I'll sell you my guitar. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Thank you.
[4374.33s -> 4391.27s]  I wonder what you're going to use it for. He's washing his hands. Can I lay in the bed? Why is
[4391.27s -> 4410.50s]  the bed on fire? Oh, that's how you do it. Okay. You have to go lie in the bed. Can I buy that
[4410.58s -> 4424.20s]  guitar off of you so I can club the doctor in the back of the head? We got more popular somehow.
[4424.84s -> 4439.53s]  I love how that's news. Don Dweeb got eight hours of comfortable sleep today. All right.
[4440.09s -> 4451.69s]  This is awesome. This is so fucking funny. I love this. Okay. Super Lucha Libre have sunk below
[4451.69s -> 4458.18s]  Wrestling Revolution. They're the least popular brand. All right. I got a Singles versus Boston
[4458.18s -> 4469.48s]  Blue Fly at 6 p.m. Okay. I'm not going to. I'm going to eat up. I'm going to eat something on
[4469.48s -> 4476.63s]  the ground. Listen Don Dweeb. I've been keeping an eye on your progress. I think some changes need
[4476.63s -> 4485.26s]  to be made. Fans pay to see people they care about, but you're not popular enough to move the needle.
[4486.65s -> 4492.46s]  I had one day. Increase your popularity to 58% by the fourth week of May or I can't promise
[4492.46s -> 4503.77s]  there'll be a place for you. Shit. I need to win my next match. Just threw an orange at him.
[4503.77s -> 4515.35s]  You have two hours till your match. I got to get the fuck out of here. I got to bring this.
[4518.34s -> 4524.62s]  No, no, no. I don't want to be on the street. I go to the gym and try to level up or something.
[4524.62s -> 4534.41s]  How do I train? It's got to be like a training bag or something, right?
[4543.77s -> 4553.19s]  Can I lift? Can I just pick stuff up off the ground? Does this count? Oh, okay. That does work.
[4554.07s -> 4574.60s]  Oh my God. Any more food in the ground? Lift weights and there are steroids.
[4576.76s -> 4588.60s]  I imagine that punching bag is important too. Okay. I need to go to the arena. How do I get
[4588.60s -> 4600.55s]  to the arena? Okay. The arena is I got to go from the gym backstage, which is over here.
[4604.50s -> 4609.21s]  All right. It's not time for my match yet. I'm in good spirits. I'm in good standing.
[4609.21s -> 4615.27s]  That guy has a bomb. That guy has a bomb. I'm not going to stand even remotely over there.
[4615.27s -> 4631.72s]  All right. It's my time. It's a singles match, right? How? Yeah, it's my time to go out on stage.
[4632.36s -> 4677.72s]  You're not going to follow me out on stage. Please. Let's go. It seems things have been
[4677.72s -> 4685.22s]  spiraling out of control here at Wrestling Revolution. You telling me? Well, not tonight
[4685.22s -> 4694.18s]  because I've been called in especially to restore order. If you step out of line in my ring,
[4694.18s -> 4705.93s]  I'll kick both of your asses as if I'm in the damn match. Let's go. I have to win this. Shut up.
[4707.02s -> 4716.68s]  Yeah. Clap this. Stop taunting. This is like, it's embarrassing for me when you do that.
[4721.67s -> 4732.92s]  Get out of here. How do you pin? I forgot how to pin in the game. Or shit reversal if you ask me.
[4733.56s -> 4754.18s]  It's the taunt button. Okay. Hit, toss. All right. Let's go. I'm, I'm not strong enough to lift the
[4754.18s -> 4773.11s]  guy. Oh my God. He just broke my neck. Knock him down. Get out of here. Oh, that hurt me more than
[4773.11s -> 4790.25s]  it. Wow. Um, is that legal? All right. I gotta pick you up. How do you miss that? I don't understand
[4790.25s -> 4821.06s]  how you miss that. Get out of here. Good. Come on. Get him down. No. What the fuck was that? Get up.
[4821.14s -> 4839.18s]  He's got the camera. Uh, okay. I'll take it. Camera, please come over here. I, if I could have seen,
[4839.18s -> 4859.19s]  that would have been great. Uh, hello? Good. No, you know what? Can I get, let me do this if I can
[4859.19s -> 4864.70s]  get it. No, I want to climb the turnbuckle. He just threw the guitar at him. Can I climb the
[4864.70s -> 4883.34s]  turnbuckle here? Shit. That's stupid of me. I'm not doing terribly though, even though I'm way weaker
[4883.34s -> 4897.21s]  than this guy. What do I do? He's okay with the ladder being here, which is weird. I don't know.
[4898.09s -> 4919.66s]  Might get it. Reverse, reverse, reverse, please. It's so stupid. Yeah. Uh, we're both at the same
[4919.66s -> 4939.42s]  hell. Uh-huh. What an idiot fell for it. This guy's harder than millennia. Grab. What do you mean?
[4939.42s -> 4951.75s]  Grab the gun. What gun? Is this thing over this over here? This is not a gun. I don't know if this
[4951.75s -> 4966.01s]  is, I think that's illegal. I don't think I can use that. All right. Come on. This dude reverses
[4966.01s -> 4979.74s]  every single submission. It'll tell you if it's illegal. Okay. Dude, this blocking that this guy
[4979.74s -> 5009.70s]  is really come on. What the fuck? Um, how do I stop reversing everything? The gun on the,
[5010.50s -> 5025.34s]  are you trying to tell me if I shoot? I'm not going to shoot this guy. I have to get my popularity
[5025.34s -> 5041.48s]  up. It means I have to win a match, not get disqualified. Let's go for Finn. Shoot. I'm not
[5041.48s -> 5070.79s]  going to shoot him. Not right now. My hand. Fuck. God damn it. How do you reverse? Get over there.
[5070.79s -> 5110.66s]  Choke him. Hit him. That's it. I have more health than he does. Jesus. Go. Oh, please. Get over
[5110.66s -> 5118.55s]  here. Who's, I don't know who's doing this too. Am I choking him or is he, I don't know what's
[5118.55s -> 5136.04s]  happening. I can't tell who's doing this. He has me. No. Oh, he's going to break my head off.
[5136.04s -> 5159.43s]  I need the gun. It's the only way that it's not the only way. Here we go. I got it. He hit his
[5159.43s -> 5163.67s]  head on the ladder. He hit his head on the ladder. We're good. We're good. He hit his head on the
[5163.67s -> 5170.12s]  ladder. He hit his head on the ladder. We're good. It's a gun. I'm not going to, oh my God.
[5170.12s -> 5187.02s]  Stop with the gun. It's a rope break if I've ever seen one. Yep. I don't know. What are you,
[5187.66s -> 5216.12s]  are you serious? This is so close. It's too close. I am actually having trouble getting up. God
[5216.12s -> 5241.86s]  damn it. Choke him. What's going on? Do it. Oh my God. Why? Finn, that's got to be it.
[5246.58s -> 5259.99s]  One minute in the match. One minute. Oh my God. There's a hot dog out here. I can't. I don't want
[5259.99s -> 5275.13s]  to do it. I can't. No. This is like Mortal Kombat rules. Do I have more health than he does?
[5275.85s -> 5306.65s]  I got him. I got him. What's happening to my arm? Who wins? No, put this down. Put this down. Put
[5306.65s -> 5313.86s]  this down. Put this down. Put this down. I'm not going to use this. I don't know how to put it down.
[5313.86s -> 5317.22s]  How do you put it down without shooting it? How do I put it down without shooting it? I need to
[5317.22s -> 5347.56s]  put it down. Okay. Good. I know I can't shoot him. I'm getting up. Good. Okay. What about my
[5347.56s -> 5370.95s]  popularity? Thank God. I'm no longer facing, was it 58, right? I made it. 58. I made some money there
[5370.95s -> 5394.95s]  probably too, right? 1,100. There we go. There it is. All right. I'm back with a 5k. What if I go
[5394.95s -> 5406.47s]  out there right now? No. I need to go to sleep and I need to train. Actually, you know, let me
[5407.19s -> 5414.98s]  let me go do an activity while I sell sometime. How's your first victory at Wrestling Revolution
[5414.98s -> 5425.43s]  Don Dweeblitz? Let's hope it wasn't the last. Okay. Are we buds? Can I like shake hands or
[5425.43s -> 5443.24s]  something? All right. What about the bar? Pizza. The show's over. I imagine people are going to
[5443.24s -> 5462.81s]  be coming to the bar. Is this your hamburger? I don't know. Remember you're on a mission to
[5462.81s -> 5471.11s]  increase by popularity to 58%. I got it. You only have until the fourth week of May. You better
[5471.11s -> 5484.79s]  make sure you're on top of it. I'm already there, man. Can I order a drink? Okay. I'd like a drink,
[5484.79s -> 5503.96s]  please. I'm not trying to do this. I promise. I just want to sit in the stool. I'm losing health.
[5505.72s -> 5535.11s]  What happened? Oh my god. I can't. That wasn't me. That wasn't me. But I, this guy is, we gotta,
[5535.67s -> 5550.18s]  I don't know. I'm so confused. What was the point of that? This guy's just a dick. Okay,
[5550.18s -> 5567.30s]  I gotta get my revenge. Get out of the way. Oh my god. Are they all here together?
[5574.54s -> 5581.26s]  Where are you? There you are. What's your name? I don't know. Is it this point right here? This
[5581.26s -> 5607.88s]  guy right here. Oh my god. He's unstoppable. Oh my god. What? Oh shit. We have to take that guy out.
[5607.88s -> 5610.92s]  I hit that guy in the back of the head with a chair and he just turned and looked at me.
[5618.76s -> 5635.46s]  You're faster than me, dweeb. What? Oh my god. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. What are you? I
[5635.46s -> 5640.34s]  love how the AI just randomly, but this guy over here just sitting watching. You look like a mess.
[5640.34s -> 5666.01s]  Why don't you take a shower? Oh, I have to clean myself. Get me out of here. The guy left anyways.
[5671.94s -> 5700.46s]  Oh boy. I thought he left. Okay. I'm gonna go to the hotel. Hotel's right here. No, you idiot.
[5700.46s -> 5718.18s]  Oh my god. The hotel is right there. I need to form a team. I can't do my next match.
[5718.90s -> 5734.02s]  I really don't think so. I lost popularity. I still have enough. Pables and table legs match
[5737.53s -> 5750.06s]  versus Berlin. Okay, this is at 10 PM. I need to heal or something. What time is it? What time
[5750.06s -> 5761.00s]  is it right now? I need to go to the hospital and lie down for an hour. Oh my god. I have two hours
[5761.00s -> 5766.17s]  each. Are you kidding me? You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever.
[5766.73s -> 5774.12s]  Okay. Please accept a hundred dollar bonus as a reward. Just make sure you keep it up.
[5774.12s -> 5782.26s]  Keep up the good work. Thanks. Thanks for the hundred dollars. I don't think I don't have enough
[5782.26s -> 5793.03s]  time. I don't know what to do. My match is in an hour and a half. I just need to eat food on the
[5793.03s -> 5800.46s]  ground. Is there a cafeteria? Hospital. It's probably the hospital. The only thing I can do,
[5800.46s -> 5815.14s]  right? Just lie in the bed for an hour. Go to the subway. That's not a subway eat fresh subway.
[5815.14s -> 5848.98s]  That is a drive on a rail subway. This is all right. I have one hour. Come on. Just food and
[5848.98s -> 5893.51s]  drink on the ground. 30 minutes. 20 minutes. All right. I got to go. Where do I go? I forget
[5893.51s -> 5902.90s]  how to get there. It's backstage. Over here. What's wrong? I'm going to puke. What's wrong with me?
[5902.90s -> 5941.75s]  I'm holding my mouth. What's going on? Hurry up. Come on. We needed that sleep.
[5942.55s -> 5962.44s]  Apparently. Really needed that sleep. The guy's double fisting Mike. So what happens if I just
[5962.44s -> 5981.62s]  stay asleep here? What happens here? He hits a referee in the head with a bat. What happens?
[5981.62s -> 5996.95s]  Oh no. I think they're getting annoyed. The entrance won't stop. Oh, here we go. Okay.
[5997.99s -> 6024.31s]  Why do they have beds everywhere? All week we've been polling fans on which match they would like
[6024.31s -> 6033.13s]  to see. And they voted for Don Dweeb versus Berlain in a beds and barbed bats match.
[6033.85s -> 6039.86s]  They sure did. Which conveniently enough is the exact situation we prepared for.
[6044.54s -> 6047.34s]  In case you've never seen a match like this before, let's make sure that we're clear about
[6047.34s -> 6050.86s]  the rules. This is like first person to like go to sleep. We have to like go to like, oh,
[6050.86s -> 6058.07s]  I'm going to go to bed first. Pin or submission falls count anywhere and there are no disqualifications.
[6058.07s -> 6064.04s]  Those rules suit me perfectly. So it seems these fans want to see you suffer.
[6064.68s -> 6071.45s]  Oh, they just felt they had to do something this drastic to make one of your matches entertaining.
[6075.85s -> 6091.74s]  Okay. Well, that was nice. Thank you. You want to keep it hardcore? Fine. Oh my God. Look,
[6091.74s -> 6107.58s]  I'll take it. I just almost killed him. Look at his health. Stop. Okay. I'm all right. They're
[6107.58s -> 6129.42s]  painting. It's painting of the ultimate warrior. He's dual welding. I just have to pin him, right?
[6140.95s -> 6155.10s]  Good. All right. This is good. Give me that bat. That person's not supposed to be in here.
[6155.66s -> 6175.48s]  Get out of here. Are they bullying me? I'm just doing what I have to do. They're attacking me.
[6178.52s -> 6188.38s]  Outlaw Eaton is here. Um, is outlaw Eaton here to fight me or is outlaw? Oh, good. Perfect. That
[6188.38s -> 6200.73s]  works for me. Me and outlaw Eaton are going to be friends. I just have to pin them. What do the beds
[6200.73s -> 6205.50s]  have to do with any of this, by the way? That's the stupidest thing. All right. We're going to,
[6205.50s -> 6221.14s]  I'm going to do like a suplex to him on bed. Nice double team. I got to end it flashy. Come here.
[6221.86s -> 6234.14s]  No, get, let's go. Uh, that did not work at all. Don't ask me why that didn't work. I have no idea.
[6236.55s -> 6254.17s]  You know what? Just pin him, right? Like honestly, he fit hardcore. Give me that mic.
[6254.17s -> 6276.50s]  It's not going to work. Welcome to bed and pin pin. Now that's it. There's no way you get up from
[6276.50s -> 6292.39s]  that. You gotta be kidding me, dude. Um, no, excuse me, please. It has zero health. How is
[6292.39s -> 6312.86s]  this still happening? Oh my God. This guy's impossible. All right. This is it. We need to
[6312.86s -> 6323.02s]  get on the bed and then I need to, I need to finish. I need to, how do I say this? You need to,
[6323.91s -> 6335.18s]  I need to the table. I need to power bomb you through the table. God damn it. I'm done. Get
[6335.18s -> 6358.25s]  over here. Just, just start, just, this is happening to me again. Help me. Help. Why is this guy
[6358.25s -> 6381.83s]  unkillable? That has to be it up here. Climb up here. I want to do like a pile driver to you.
[6381.83s -> 6408.84s]  Come on. What are you so afraid of? I shit. Okay. Why can't I, I'm sick of this. Just give,
[6408.84s -> 6416.84s]  I'm going to bash his head in with this great until he can't move. You make me go against like
[6416.84s -> 6443.51s]  the hardcore champion guy, right? All right. This is it. Of course. Crush his head. No,
[6444.23s -> 6465.93s]  this guy seriously wants to come in so bad. He's fucking fed. Yeah. Dude, the guy back there
[6465.93s -> 6479.59s]  watching. Let go, let go, let go, let go. We're friends. Beat him. You need to find the gun.
[6491.45s -> 6504.49s]  Maybe I should find the gun. Seriously. I can't keep this guy not. That's it. Yes.
[6504.89s -> 6510.97s]  You cost me that match. Outlaw Eaton. If you mess with my career, I'll end yours.
[6511.61s -> 6576.60s]  Let go of my hand. Yeah. We keep it hardcore. Neck. Okay. Popularity way up attitude way up.
[6577.16s -> 6586.55s]  I lost agility though. Outlaw Eaton has generated a buzz by interfering in that
[6586.55s -> 6596.90s]  match. That means I got to find Eloy. I accept to sleep on a bed this time. Yeah, please. Big money.
[6604.04s -> 6609.53s]  Ooh. We're running short of staff tonight, Dweeb. Can I count on you to referee one of the matches?
[6611.93s -> 6621.38s]  Yeah. Am I going to get paid? Thanks, Dweeb. You just saved the show. Please accept an extra $350
[6621.38s -> 6639.00s]  for your time. Nice. Oh, it's right now. All right. Is this a false count? No. Okay. This is just
[6639.00s -> 6647.22s]  regular match. I'm going to spend this time to just heal. I don't care about anything else.
[6647.22s -> 6650.66s]  I'm going to go find like, I'm going to go in the audience and find like hamburgers and stuff. I'll
[6650.66s -> 6672.55s]  be back. Anybody have any food? Is there food back here? Anybody have any extra popcorn or anything?
[6673.19s -> 6687.43s]  There has to be somebody. Somebody has to have food, right? There's no stray food. Whatever.
[6687.43s -> 6695.99s]  What about your job? My job? I'm doing it. It's fine. Can I like grab onto the ring and maybe get
[6695.99s -> 6711.86s]  like a snack or something? That guy just tapped out. Whatever. I need to heal. Who do I want to
[6711.86s -> 6727.50s]  win? Self-insert character. Yeah, it really is. I got to get this out of here. This is not allowed.
[6733.19s -> 6757.16s]  Oh, count. Should I count to 10? Should I count him out? You lose. I don't know why you were
[6757.16s -> 6761.64s]  refereeing this match, Don Dweeb. You're obviously not qualified. I just gave you an extra five to
[6761.64s -> 6769.00s]  10 full seconds. You just made the biggest mistake of your life. Nice fucking Dark Souls roll. Excuse
[6769.00s -> 6805.42s]  me. God. Get up. Let's get back in the ring. That's right. He won. Congratulations. All right. I got,
[6805.42s -> 6825.37s]  that was easy. 350 bucks. I established Don Dweeb as a face. I don't know how that happened. Okay.
[6825.37s -> 6835.18s]  I need, so glad we won that match, Don. It was a pleasure working with you. I agree. So I wonder
[6835.18s -> 6848.17s]  if we can do a tag team or something together. Um, everybody's sleeping on the ground. This is
[6848.17s -> 6874.02s]  weird. It's a gas leak. Another win just makes you another target Dweeb. Now it will mean even more
[6874.02s -> 6905.78s]  when I beat you. Oh, you're not going to have very much health tomorrow, are you? Oh no,
[6905.78s -> 6910.42s]  I'm making enemies. All right. Dweeb, you proved your point. I don't want any more trouble with you.
[6911.38s -> 6925.94s]  Yeah. You went right to bed. Okay. I got to get out of here. Oh, you know, I'm tired too.
[6927.38s -> 6951.56s]  I'm a little sleepy. Oh, I can't sleep on the street here. Why not? Hotel, hotel. Yep. Where's
[6951.56s -> 6966.79s]  the hotel? Cemetery. No, I want to go to the hotel. What? Are there people in these caskets?
[6969.77s -> 6985.72s]  No, I don't, I don't know about this. I was right in front of it. Where is it? Podcast experience.
[6985.72s -> 7018.82s]  Share your where? Where? Where? The right? Hurry. Hotel. Oh shit. Hey, I know you. What's up? Oh,
[7018.82s -> 7027.99s]  cool. You want to like room together? All right. Yeah. Can I have one of your, uh, water? Well,
[7027.99s -> 7036.52s]  all right. I guess I'm, I'm going to sleep on the bed, I guess. Appreciate you letting me have the
[7036.52s -> 7058.31s]  bed. Hot bunk sleepover. Yeah. Four hours of comfortable sleep. That was it. I want to get
[7058.31s -> 7065.75s]  that championship. But your Libre is really not doing well. All right. There's a three way match
[7066.47s -> 7074.52s]  at 7 PM. That sounds good. I'm going to stay in the bed for a little while. I think it's for the
[7074.52s -> 7095.35s]  best. Can I go on the bed again? I know I wash my hands. So how do we work together?
[7096.74s -> 7113.58s]  Oh, we're like doing a good friend. This is I like this guy. All right. So how do we do anything for
[7113.58s -> 7131.56s]  me? I think we're just talking. We're just hanging out. This is healing me. Look at my health. What?
[7131.56s -> 7141.42s]  I just wanted to wish you luck in your match tonight. Dawn Dweeb. Who's this? After all,
[7141.42s -> 7144.94s]  dangerous things happen back here and it would be a shame if you ended up crawling to the ring.
[7145.58s -> 7152.60s]  But neither of us want that to happen. Hand over $870 and I'll let you live.
[7154.26s -> 7162.90s]  Okay. Yeah. Bring it. You piece of shit. I'll be ready. It's not even worth my time. Dweeb,
[7162.90s -> 7171.69s]  I'll get you when you least expect it. Mm hmm. Sure you will. You believe that guy?
[7175.82s -> 7182.12s]  It's not him, right? This is not this is this person that's not the person I was just on the
[7182.12s -> 7189.10s]  phone with. I don't know. Eaton. Eaton. I think this is the guy. Eaton. This is the guy. I think
[7189.74s -> 7194.28s]  Eaton. This is the guy. This is the guy that I was just he was literally talking through the door.
[7195.00s -> 7211.59s]  You're more popular than me. I don't want any trouble. Oh my god. The match.
[7215.29s -> 7219.29s]  Listen Dawn Dweeb. A lot has changed since we first signed you to $900 a week. Yeah. I got
[7219.29s -> 7224.65s]  I got something going on here in a second. Yeah. We have to make sacrifices to stay afloat. How
[7224.65s -> 7230.71s]  would you feel about a pay cut? Pay cut, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Just just a quick pay cut. Yeah.
[7231.27s -> 7243.85s]  You pay me what we agreed. Yeah. Oh, you're gonna cut me off? What? What do you mean cut me off?
[7244.41s -> 7250.63s]  Congratulations on beating Berlain yet again. That raised your profile to 64%.
[7251.59s -> 7260.49s]  Somebody's getting choked over here. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. All right. I have a match
[7260.49s -> 7271.69s]  apparently, I guess. Am I still signed with this company? I'm sure there are places you'd rather
[7271.69s -> 7280.17s]  be Dawn, but I'm glad to have you here. Thanks. I got I got to do my I got to do my routine.
[7281.29s -> 7284.65s]  I'm so fucking stressed. God damn it. One, two, three.
[7288.92s -> 7316.34s]  There's nobody here. This shit's empty. This is where your story starts, Dawn Dweeb. You don't
[7316.34s -> 7324.58s]  think I'll be you'll have to learn the ropes here each week before a major promotion even considers
[7324.58s -> 7330.63s]  offering you a contract. Why am I talking to myself? For some people it never happens while
[7330.63s -> 7338.17s]  others wish it never had because they end up back here broken. Be careful what you sign up for
[7338.17s -> 7345.78s]  because there'll be a lot of promoters trying to take advantage of you. If you look after yourself
[7345.78s -> 7352.87s]  and make smart choices, it's perfectly possible to have a fulfilling career. Anyway, let's see
[7352.87s -> 7368.07s]  what you got before we see how far you'll go. Huh? Who are these people? I thought this is a fatal
[7368.07s -> 7382.12s]  three way. Why are there five people in the ring? I'm back at wrestling school. Really?
[7384.36s -> 7395.18s]  I got fired. That's that's that's a horse shit. What are you talking about? I didn't take the pay
[7395.18s -> 7409.67s]  cut. What the fuck? I have to fight these idiots. It's not even a referee. I'll get signed. Don't
[7409.67s -> 7413.59s]  worry. I'll get it. Look, I'll take this opportunity. I'm going to sleep through every match and I'm
[7413.59s -> 7421.16s]  going to I'm going to level up my strength and shit. What do I care? I'm not signed any promotion.
[7421.16s -> 7429.77s]  I'm just going to go like lift weights, drink at the bar, make friends. Yeah, there's the redemption.
[7429.77s -> 7437.11s]  The redemption arc is coming here soon. Yeah, training arc. Don't ask me how the hell this
[7437.11s -> 7455.16s]  plays out. Honestly, just disqualify me. I don't even want to be here. It's not even a referee.
[7455.80s -> 7481.29s]  Yeah, what am I? Why am I even here? No, fuck this up. I want I want this. I'm taking company
[7481.29s -> 7495.78s]  property. This guy does not want me to leave. Come on. No, leave me alone. I'm the he's like
[7495.78s -> 7517.26s]  whatever. Oh shit. Oh, good thing for Rupert Royale. I spent $100 taking the chair. All right,
[7517.26s -> 7526.60s]  somebody signed me to a deal. I'm so sorry to see you lose to splitters McGinn. That knocked your
[7526.60s -> 7538.07s]  profile down to 61%. Yeah, that's too bad. All right, training arc time. I'm going to go sleep
[7538.71s -> 7547.98s]  at the hotel. I don't know what this is, but I'm taking it.
[7549.05s -> 7552.41s]  Losing your first match was a bad start on Dweeb. It's all downhill for you at wrestling school.
[7553.37s -> 7560.68s]  Yeah, I don't think so. I think it's only up from here because I'm down downgraded to the bottom
[7560.68s -> 7578.76s]  tier. It's only up. By the way, fuck you. Oh my god, that pissed a lot of people off. I was one
[7578.76s -> 7588.49s]  of you. I was one of you guys. We used to be tag team partners. No, I never had one. All right,
[7588.49s -> 7612.39s]  let's do it. Sleep. Very good. $160,000. Whatever.
[7621.24s -> 7626.41s]  At this point, I'm paying the newspaper to run these articles. I'm not doing this on their own.
[7629.40s -> 7636.87s]  Hey, run an article about how I got 10 hours of sleep last night. I have a singles versus
[7636.87s -> 7644.66s]  Sebastian slobber. I can win this. I need to heal though. What's the studio? I'm curious.
[7645.30s -> 7678.60s]  It's a studio. What's the studio? It's a bar. Studio? How do I get to the studio? Oh,
[7678.60s -> 7691.99s]  it's like a podcast. All right, what's going on in here? Oh my god, there's money on the ground.
[7691.99s -> 7707.26s]  Holy shit, that was $440 on the ground. Can I be on your podcast? Wait, let me try. Okay,
[7708.26s -> 7714.84s]  so what are we going to talk about? I can't interview everyone who sits there.
[7714.84s -> 7739.83s]  Go and do something worth talking about. Okay, all right. And I got it on camera too.
[7739.83s -> 7750.94s]  Yeah, you can take the tape. Okay, take the tape and I'm ready for the interview.
[7750.94s -> 7755.88s]  So what happened there? Well, I decided I was going to attack you and just like film it. And
[7755.88s -> 7760.07s]  then that was something you could upload and talk about. I mean, I got, did you see what happened?
[7760.07s -> 7764.79s]  I got knocked down. I got knocked down to the wrestling school, which can you actually believe
[7764.79s -> 7799.13s]  that? I don't know. It's unbelievable. Oh, I have a match. Nice talking to you. On my way to the bar.
[7799.13s -> 7805.13s]  Oh, I'm sorry. I can't go. All right. I'll leave you here at the backstage area. You
[7805.13s -> 7808.33s]  know where to find me if you change your mind. I wish I could go with you, but I got a match
[7808.33s -> 7824.46s]  right now. Oh my god. My attitude is so bad. Okay. No more lip syncing. This dude came out
[7824.46s -> 7839.06s]  and ate a fucking banana. Can you believe it? Anybody who couldn't beat Splitters McGigan
[7839.06s -> 7846.09s]  doesn't belong in the ring with me. Splitters McGigan is nothing compared to me. And that makes
[7846.09s -> 7861.58s]  you less than nothing. That's kind of not fair. Let me see. Let me see if I can just smash his
[7861.58s -> 7886.98s]  head in. All right. Fine. You want to do that? I'm in so much trouble. Why did you trust fall
[7886.98s -> 7906.68s]  outside the ring? Because I don't know. All right. Let's wrestle. Get it. Go. It might be too heavy.
[7907.40s -> 7928.15s]  Good move. How can you seriously get up faster than me? This guy's way stronger than me too.
[7928.79s -> 7955.85s]  Unfortunately. His stats are like five times better than mine. You were just on the referee's
[7955.85s -> 7972.10s]  podcast. Was I? Really? Is that the same guy? How did you get here before I did? He's too heavy.
[7972.10s -> 7988.28s]  I'm going to lose this match. It's possible, but I need to taunt more. The only way you can do a
[7988.28s -> 7998.44s]  special move is that bar in the bottom of the health bar goes up all the way. See if I can get
[7998.44s -> 8016.82s]  it. You should use the gun. I'm not going to use the gun yet. That's only in an extreme circumstance.
[8016.82s -> 8049.18s]  Nice. That was a really smooth transition. Come on. Yes. What happened there? Make it quick.
[8049.82s -> 8061.91s]  Is it possible to come back? I think so. If I can get that filled up, it will be. God damn it.
[8061.91s -> 8082.49s]  Bad. Bad. Come on. No. His arms are locked. Why did I make him five feet tall? My reach is so bad.
[8082.49s -> 8113.29s]  This is a great opportunity to do this. Taunt. He ain't getting up. Hurry. He's going to get
[8113.29s -> 8118.58s]  disqualified. Do it already. Swing it. Swing it then. Hit me with it. Hit me in the face.
[8118.58s -> 8140.86s]  Get yourself disqualified. See what I care. I got plenty of time. I'm almost there.
[8141.18s -> 8156.41s]  Nice. All right. This should be it. Here it comes. Here it comes. I'm going to be able to
[8156.41s -> 8166.18s]  do my... What was my finishing move? I forget. I don't remember. Go for it. Oops.
[8171.45s -> 8194.70s]  Do it again. Quick. Ow. That took a lot of health off. Get up. Please don't. How did I do the
[8194.70s -> 8207.46s]  Canadian Destroyer? And this guy is now kicking the shit out of me. I don't know what happened
[8207.46s -> 8238.49s]  there. I have absolutely no idea. I wish I could tell you what happened. Can I get a submission?
[8238.49s -> 8252.30s]  Can we close? He's not near the ropes. My goodness. He's going to fucking submit me, isn't he?
[8256.55s -> 8290.89s]  No. No. You get tired? What was that all about? What's going on? Oh, come on. The ref is doing
[8290.89s -> 8295.66s]  what I would be doing. He's just like going up on the top ropes, getting down, rolling around
[8295.66s -> 8309.45s]  on the ground. I would be just having... I would be jumping around. I do a move and then I get hurt.
[8309.45s -> 8337.32s]  This is stupid. That works for me. How come this is not filling faster? Fuck. Ow. What? Why?
[8338.97s -> 8346.74s]  Oh, my God. What's happening? Dude. This is illegal. That's illegal.
[8350.33s -> 8358.81s]  Oh, my God. Look over here. He's sitting in the chair. I didn't do anything. I can't move.
[8359.69s -> 8374.39s]  Oh, my God. Please. This can't end like this. Oh, my God. Please. Get off of me. Why was he
[8374.47s -> 8379.91s]  allowed to do that shit? But not me. That's so fucking unfair. I'm at eight, eight, eight, eight.
[8379.91s -> 8409.13s]  I'm fine. Count him out. Count him out. I'll do it again. Good. Keep him down. No, you piece of shit.
[8412.41s -> 8425.99s]  You got to be fucking kidding me. Dude, I grabbed you. Why are you able to reverse it every time?
[8435.21s -> 8444.18s]  Dude, this is... Dude. I keep just saying dude. This match obviously is getting out of control.
[8444.18s -> 8460.18s]  Allow me to restore order. There's 10 seconds left. Pin up. Pin up. Quick. No.
[8461.30s -> 8468.73s]  I just received word from backstage this match must be restarted immediately.
[8470.20s -> 8490.01s]  Huh? What are you doing to us? Dude, that's so stupid. I don't even know who this guy,
[8490.01s -> 8517.83s]  Sifu, is fighting. I think it's me. And at some point, don't you just call this match?
[8517.83s -> 8525.69s]  You know what I'm saying? Like, at what point is this over? It's been over for a long time.
[8525.69s -> 8546.54s]  One of us is going to get injured. That's it. Pin up. Row break is stupid. All right. Maybe I
[8546.54s -> 8565.16s]  can make him submit. Let's try it. There's no gun? No, there is no gun. Please just say...
[8569.53s -> 8577.13s]  Dude, I do a move to this motherfucker. He just reverses it immediately. Immediately. Every time.
[8577.21s -> 8616.14s]  I know. My stats are awful. I don't... Get off of me. I don't even know if I can play anymore. I
[8616.14s -> 8629.82s]  think I just have to die. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.
[8629.82s -> 8637.02s]  Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. I lose. That's un-fucking-believable. This guy's so bad. I made him like a manager.
[8637.02s -> 8662.22s]  I made this guy a manager. And I gave him like 40% strength. Get over here. I can't even attack
[8662.46s -> 8685.00s]  him. Don't let him get away with this. At least it wasn't affected. Listen Don Dewey. I've got a
[8685.00s -> 8693.14s]  match coming up that I'm not sure I can win on my own. Okay. Would you consider assisting me at
[8693.14s -> 8701.82s]  ringside for 350 bucks? Absolutely. They made you pay for the banana. I need to start making friends.
[8701.82s -> 8729.11s]  I can't just... Everybody hate me. What is money used for? I don't know. This is a... We're doing
[8729.11s -> 8758.89s]  this in the gym. What else is over here? It's my water. Give me that water. Wait. Are you... Who's
[8758.89s -> 8780.39s]  on my team? Who's on my team? Has the match started? Okay. You got it. You got this. Go for it.
[8782.17s -> 8812.49s]  Okay. Orange. Good reversal. Let me know if you need me. I'll be ready. I missed. Oops. God damn
[8812.49s -> 8840.97s]  it. How does that miss? I don't... I can't get in the ring. How did you... I don't know how I missed.
[8840.97s -> 8860.18s]  Should have hit. Oh my goodness. You go so far. Okay. I got it. I'll take the hit. I'll take that
[8860.18s -> 8883.10s]  for you. Okay. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
[8883.10s -> 8886.70s]  I don't want to do that. I don't want to get me out. How do I get out of the ring?
[8888.38s -> 8900.46s]  Get out of the ring. Okay. There's a pin. I think there's a pin. I think... I couldn't have done it
[8900.46s -> 8913.88s]  without you. Jesus. I just wanted to just run and throw something. Can I stay in the gym?
[8915.78s -> 8944.58s]  Good fight. What more do you want from me? Excuse me. Oh, suffer it again.
[8947.54s -> 8967.34s]  Good. Okay. I don't have a match today, right? I don't think I have a match. I have no... I don't
[8967.34s -> 8973.93s]  have anything I can do actually. Read the posters in the gym. I need to sleep. I'm not going to go
[8973.93s -> 9002.38s]  to my next match. I'm just not going. I need to level up somehow. I am not going. Nine hours
[9002.38s -> 9008.92s]  of sleep. That's good. The industry will come together to stage a special event on the fourth
[9008.92s -> 9015.56s]  week of June where all proceeds are expected to be donated to charity. Okay. I have a shoot fight
[9015.56s -> 9025.56s]  at seven o'clock. I think I'm just going to skip it. You know what I mean? Should I just skip it?
[9025.56s -> 9043.51s]  I have to level up. I can't just... You know what I mean? I need to level up. I'm not going to do
[9043.51s -> 9047.93s]  that by just losing a match and then going to sleep. Waking up and losing a match and going
[9047.93s -> 9074.25s]  to sleep. It's not going to happen. So I'm punching bags. What do you think? From the track to improve
[9074.25s -> 9102.14s]  your stamina. Oh, shit. Really? What the fuck was that? You're not going to be working out
[9102.14s -> 9121.53s]  and get out of the equipment. Seriously. I need water. Okay. That was some stamina. Is there any
[9121.53s -> 9136.36s]  water lying around? Sleep recharges you. Lift weights for strength. Drink out of the toilet.
[9136.36s -> 9151.48s]  What's going on right now? You can try to interact with any scenery by taunting nearby.
[9156.47s -> 9166.97s]  Like this? All right. My stamina is at 61%. I'm not going. Should I? I don't have any health.
[9166.97s -> 9175.91s]  How is there one bottle of water in this whole fucking gym? There's nothing even in there. How
[9175.91s -> 9189.66s]  does it splash? Oh, wait. I need to go. Is there any water on the ground here? I have no stamina.
[9189.66s -> 9204.60s]  This is the one for charity? I don't think it is. There's actually people here in this one though.
[9205.80s -> 9218.44s]  What were the rules in this one? I didn't notice. Scorpions, I know you're cowering backstage
[9218.44s -> 9225.46s]  clinging to that undergraduate title of yours. That may be the safest place for you right now,
[9225.46s -> 9232.97s]  but that treasure can't stay buried forever. I want you to pay attention to what happens
[9232.97s -> 9248.30s]  in this match because you're next. Fuck. This is bad. This is bad. This is really bad.
[9250.78s -> 9260.86s]  I'm in a lot of trouble here. You know, I need to cheese this fight. Yeah, I do. I have an idea.
[9260.86s -> 9280.47s]  Did you just really hurt your back? Go get the gun. This is not a hardcore match. There's no gun.
[9280.47s -> 9292.09s]  I promise. There's a sludge hammer over there. Your character is 50. I completely forgot about
[9292.09s -> 9313.34s]  that. Goodness. He's 55. I'm going to lose immediately here. You designed the worst
[9313.34s -> 9328.38s]  fighter possible. Shit. Go change the character in the editor. I guess I could do that and just
[9328.38s -> 9340.70s]  put his stats to like kind of normal. How much longer am I going to be in this admission for?
[9344.14s -> 9353.56s]  All right. Whatever. This guy's done. I'm retiring this guy. Don Dweeb is being retired. I'm
[9353.56s -> 9383.72s]  literally retiring Don Dweeb. No, I don't want to get up. God, stop doing that move.
[9391.67s -> 9393.59s]  He's despised.
[9403.32s -> 9411.38s]  All right. Okay. Don Dweeb. I've had enough. Oh my god.
[9426.28s -> 9443.06s]  Yeah. Most hated man in wrestling school. Don Dweeb. Shittiest character ever. I'm just
[9443.06s -> 9451.93s]  going. I'm just going to the subway. I'm going to the airport. I'm leaving. Where's the airport?
[9452.65s -> 9465.03s]  I'm just getting on a plane. I'm leaving. Barber shop. It's across from the gym. This way?
[9468.42s -> 9477.61s]  Leaving town. Yeah, it's time to leave town. I didn't want to go to the cemetery.
[9477.61s -> 9507.82s]  What's over here? Okay. Let's go. Where am I going? How much is a plane ticket? What am
[9507.82s -> 9516.98s]  I? Am I going to a different state or a country? Where am I going? Country? All right. I'm going
[9516.98s -> 9522.42s]  to be that guy. I'm going to pick the only empty seat that's next to you and eat a bunch of food.
[9523.14s -> 9556.06s]  Is there a bathroom? The plane was moving. I just bought another plane ticket. What? No,
[9556.06s -> 9583.62s]  I was. I thought it was a bathroom. How long do you stay on the plane for? This is so ridiculous.
[9583.70s -> 9598.28s]  I want to sit next to you. Can I get healed? It's been a rough six months here. Something you want
[9598.28s -> 9611.56s]  to say to me, Don Dweeb? I mean, kind of. I have a proposal for you. Well, you have my attention now.
[9611.56s -> 9624.25s]  What do you want to talk about? Well, I'd like to work with you. How do you see us working together?
[9624.25s -> 9633.30s]  Would you be my partner? We don't even work for the same company. I don't see that happening
[9633.30s -> 9682.68s]  anytime soon. Can you believe this guy? Am I sleeping? Who's asleep? Why do you never have
[9682.68s -> 9691.53s]  health? Because this guy, this guy. What? What happened? What happened? What happened? What
[9691.53s -> 9703.03s]  happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? I threw like a fucking cell phone at
[9703.03s -> 9726.30s]  him. What? What the fuck was that? What happened? God damn it. Don Dweeb has been booked to face
[9726.30s -> 9732.14s]  score bends in a singles match on the third week of June. You're a menace. I honestly, I didn't mean
[9732.14s -> 9757.70s]  to do that. I didn't, I just threw something. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I have to, I have to.
[9760.01s -> 9780.89s]  Oh my fucking goodness. I have to, he's retiring. He's trying. I'm starting over. I'm starting over.
[9780.89s -> 9795.51s]  I'm starting over. Just leave. Just leave everything. Get out. He's retired. Why is it slow?
[9805.50s -> 9824.73s]  Longest careers. Okay. Okay. We're going to, I'm making a wrestler now and it's going to be a good
[9824.73s -> 9833.30s]  wrestler. He's going to be strong. He's going to be fearsome. He's going to be, he's going to obey
[9833.94s -> 9839.03s]  all the rules and everything. It's going to be fine. We're going to make me strong.
[9839.67s -> 9849.80s]  He's going to be huge. What's a good place to start? What's like a actually like famous place
[9849.80s -> 9858.46s]  where I'm not going to get like just immediately kicked out? Is it Hollywood or revolution?
[9859.66s -> 9889.67s]  A-A-W. Okay. We're going to change a splatter. I'm going to make this quick. This guy's going
[9889.67s -> 9905.02s]  to be very good. No, not me strip. Why did that auto fill? What? I'm so confused. Me strong.
[9932.49s -> 9980.17s]  This one is going to come out with like a bat. If I come up with cash, can I just take it and
[9980.17s -> 10001.56s]  it's a $400? Definitely a hammer or a pizza. Blank. Strong. It's going to be 99% strong.
[10001.56s -> 10010.34s]  Well, that's too much. That's not fair. Let's say like 92. Really, really good attitude as well.
[10012.33s -> 10024.60s]  Me strip. No, this is me strong. I said 80, 85 popularity. Me strong is very popular.
[10024.60s -> 10037.30s]  At least 85. Okay. This is fine. I'm okay with this. Not too egregious, right? You think 85. Okay.
[10041.88s -> 10051.10s]  Me strip. Well, okay. Let's take the skill down because if he's really this strong and then,
[10051.10s -> 10072.30s]  I mean, he's supposed to be like a caveman. So me strip. There. You happy? Now he's, he's not
[10072.30s -> 10104.42s]  OP. All right. Age. Not 55. Seven, 10. That's too big, isn't it? Six, five. Six, five is okay.
[10104.42s -> 10164.71s]  Yeah. I need like caveman face. Okay. Shave. No, it looks like my face. That's kind of freaking me out.
[10165.43s -> 10188.92s]  This is freaking me the fuck out right now. Okay. We got to find a good one.
[10194.50s -> 10208.97s]  I kind of like this one. All right. 39. Definitely 39. I don't think I need to see anything else.
[10212.26s -> 10250.49s]  Yeah. 39 for sure. Baggy skin. How do I get rid of those arm bands? Material. I don't want
[10250.49s -> 10261.19s]  any material in my arms. How do I get rid of this? What? Yeah. What's your plaid arms?
[10271.83s -> 10276.94s]  I don't know how to take this off. Flesh. Okay. There we go.
[10276.94s -> 10322.62s]  I mean, it's this one. I need chest hair. No, no fish nets.
[10324.50s -> 10337.77s]  This is denim. Oh my goodness. It's denim. The denim is so weird. Okay. I like, I want the denim
[10337.77s -> 10361.43s]  for some reason. Okay. There it is. How do you copy? Can I copy this? It looks like I can, right?
[10362.95s -> 10398.76s]  Fish nets. No. I'm going to kick the shit out of everybody by the way. Okay. It looks good.
[10399.56s -> 10411.59s]  Looks good. What's going on with his arms? Oh, baggy sleeves. What's happening?
[10435.98s -> 10463.70s]  Casual can have glasses. That's fine. Okay. No collar. That's fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I
[10463.70s -> 10483.98s]  need to change this to that. Okay. How do I get this off? Can this knock him off? There we go.
[10483.98s -> 10532.90s]  Okay. I got it. No, he's strict. Coward. All right. The moves. Okay. I don't want it. No,
[10532.90s -> 10542.31s]  no partners. No, nothing. No partners. No story friends. No promotion. All American wrestling,
[10542.31s -> 10550.15s]  wrestler face. I think the moves are fine considering it's that character. So that's
[10550.15s -> 10555.78s]  a big heavy character. Should be good. I don't think they're going to do much. Yeah. This is
[10555.78s -> 10572.55s]  going to be great. All right. From the Northwest USA. Where was the first man ever recorded?
[10589.03s -> 10603.62s]  We're in the Middle East. Africa. Make him Canadian. Okay. Okay. That's funny. It's Canadian.
[10608.38s -> 10625.67s]  Wrestling career. Let's go. Let's do it. I'm ready. Good. Singles versus wide tied 10 PM. I'm ready.
[10626.39s -> 10637.27s]  No more fucking around. Don't let anybody scare you out of taking this route. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[10637.27s -> 10653.94s]  Yep. I'm unstoppable now. Look at how much damage I just did. I see you've just had to take
[10653.94s -> 10661.66s]  responsibility for what happens behind the scenes. Me strip. If you take this route,
[10661.66s -> 10664.78s]  it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time for your match. Yep. I know
[10664.78s -> 10672.97s]  how this works. Only enter when your time is up. Amber means somebody else's match is taking place.
[10672.97s -> 10698.15s]  What if I make my own fucking rules? That guy's a gun. Look after it. I know. I know. I get it.
[10698.15s -> 10702.15s]  It's too much to handle. You can always opt out and skip straight to the action. I know.
[10702.15s -> 10722.25s]  This is a very weird taunt that I didn't know that I had. Me strong. Me pick up thing on ground.
[10723.13s -> 10756.62s]  What thing? What thing do? What thing do? I don't think you can shoot the gun. You can't shoot the
[10756.62s -> 10767.77s]  gun. I don't have enough intelligence to shoot it. I don't think you can shoot backstage.
[10768.33s -> 10808.10s]  There's no ammo. Is it my turn? Yeah, you can't shoot it. Singles match coming up. Haunt. Yeah,
[10808.10s -> 10825.18s]  I tried. L2 didn't work. You can't. You're not going to shoot me, right? Ow. Yeah, you cannot
[10825.18s -> 10870.18s]  shoot the gun. I thought I just killed that guy. My turn. Me strip. Wait, what does it say? I need
[10870.18s -> 10880.52s]  money more than I need yet another win on my record. For 20 to $2,000, I could be persuaded
[10880.52s -> 10893.50s]  to lie down and hand you a victory. What? Oh no, I have to pay you. No thanks. That's not happening.
[10893.50s -> 10932.30s]  Beating I give you will cost more than $2,000. Will it now? I don't know. You can't shoot. There's
[10932.30s -> 10949.35s]  no you can't shoot the gun. Unless there's some weird way to do it. What the fuck? Get up. This
[10949.35s -> 10970.62s]  is way better. Me stop you. Me slam. Me. Me lose match. Me lose match. Me lose match cause count out.
[10970.62s -> 11002.62s]  Come on, get in here. This is us frog. You don't know rules of fight. Me fight anyone who stand in
[11002.62s -> 11041.61s]  way. Wow. Oh my goodness. He's breaking my arm. I love how the punches are so strong. We get a pin
[11041.61s -> 11074.31s]  here. He choke. Pin. Oh my God. He's unbeatable. I'm going to be a millionaire. Me Canada. Me cause
[11074.31s -> 11110.90s]  injury. Loud sound startled me. Could be snake. Now strip. He's like scared. I don't know. Let's get
[11110.90s -> 11129.78s]  away. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm going to get that championship belt. Yeah,
[11129.78s -> 11155.08s]  I'll take 2000. What was 700 bucks? Make a mistake. Congratulations on beating Y tie. That
[11155.08s -> 11168.25s]  raised your profile to holy shit. Everybody wins their first match. Me strip competition will get
[11168.25s -> 11193.61s]  stiffer at auto. Oh my God. I'm more skillful than you. Me strip. Don't start something. You
[11193.61s -> 11228.47s]  can't finish. How do we take this outside? Let's take it outside. Oh, menace. He can't be tamed.
[11229.19s -> 11278.25s]  Somebody needs to stop him. Why would he know what the stutter is? Why would he know what that is?
[11284.26s -> 11286.50s]  They're all trying to get away so bad.
[11292.41s -> 11306.15s]  All right. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I can't just do this
[11306.15s -> 11313.50s]  every time. Do I get popularity points for coming and just causing a fucking ruckus?
[11314.22s -> 11356.49s]  I thought that guy's name was Glitter Andy. I need health. I need to go to bed. Oh my God.
[11356.49s -> 11377.83s]  What a brilliant idea. We sleep on park bench. We don't know what bed is. We don't like you.
[11377.83s -> 11422.76s]  We skateboard. That's better. We sleep. Territorial. We refuse to pay income tax.
[11422.76s -> 11452.89s]  All right. Singles match. We're at nine o'clock. Ow. I want the skateboard. I'm taking it with me.
[11452.89s -> 11462.26s]  I'm going to the bar. It's a dull joke from chat. I did. You're right. Looks like you had a late
[11462.26s -> 11474.49s]  night me strip. Go to sleep at a sensible time for more energy. What's this guy doing? Me drink.
[11477.48s -> 11489.24s]  Perfect. This is 9 a.m. bar visit. Is it? No, it's not that early.
[11506.81s -> 11524.70s]  Wait, can I just drink this stuff? Oh my goodness. I'm sorry. What's up? Somebody,
[11524.70s -> 11544.14s]  you're a fire. Another stunner. All right. I have a match in like an hour.
[11544.14s -> 11555.96s]  And honestly, it doesn't matter. I'll be fine. I wasn't even looking at it.
[11555.96s -> 11574.17s]  This is such a shit show. It seriously is. What's this? Strange thing. Delicious.
[11575.05s -> 11603.78s]  Must eat more. Bring more food. Usually eat carcass of animal. Match. I don't know where it is.
[11603.86s -> 11609.42s]  Where is it over here? Where is it? I don't know. I actually forget where it is.
[11609.42s -> 11633.86s]  I showed up an hour late to the match. They wouldn't even be doing this anymore.
[11633.86s -> 11643.75s]  They waited an hour for me to get here. Let's be out here cutting another promo. But screw that.
[11643.75s -> 11651.30s]  I got something real to say. The truth is that all American wrestling is getting slaughtered
[11651.30s -> 11659.80s]  in the ratings by weekend warriors. And you can blame Matt Showman for that. Everybody knows I
[11659.80s -> 11668.18s]  should be the world champion. It's a perfect Sean as the future of this company. We all know who
[11668.18s -> 11673.96s]  should be the United States champion. Probably going to be fired for this, but I don't care.
[11673.96s -> 11684.20s]  The important thing is that the truth heard is heard for once. I don't think you want to go blow
[11684.20s -> 11689.77s]  to blow with Mee Strip. That's a big, that's a big problem. I don't think that was a, what a, what a,
[11689.77s -> 11717.59s]  what a dummy. What a dummy. Good. Good. Good. What is, what is, what is Mee Strong's moves?
[11717.59s -> 11737.53s]  There you go. Big suplex. All right. When do I get the title match?
[11738.25s -> 11746.22s]  Because I'm obviously better than everybody here. Big power bomb. Let's see it.
[11754.44s -> 11761.96s]  People like, uh, Mee Strip, right? Really good ratings, right? I gotta go find the title holder.
[11761.96s -> 11782.82s]  Okay. Sounds good. Just hang him here. Let the blood flow. I think I'm going to stun. Yeah,
[11782.82s -> 11803.64s]  it's a stunner. Why does he have a stunner? That's so stupid. No one's beating me. All right. That
[11803.64s -> 11829.93s]  was relaxed. Is he finally dead? Did he go too hard? Did he go too hard?
[11846.46s -> 11867.11s]  Oh, all right. Let's go. Profile has improved. I'm just ruining careers at this point.
[11869.99s -> 11873.75s]  This game is so ridiculous. It just really is.
[11876.07s -> 11880.95s]  So outrageous. I wish I, maybe I should have spent some time to learn about the, um,
[11881.83s -> 11894.57s]  general manager mode, but this is exactly what I wanted to do. All right. I should probably,
[11895.29s -> 11904.82s]  what should I spend money on? What do you spend money on? Show is finished. All right. Time for
[11904.82s -> 11929.80s]  bed. Still up. Did you catch that in midair? All right. Go to bed, bed, bed, bed, bed, bed.
[11933.75s -> 11940.36s]  Oh, wait. What about the studio? I'm notable enough to talk, right? At this point, I think I am.
[11940.92s -> 11951.40s]  Oh, wait. Actually doing taxes. Heard you've been starting fights, Mee Strip. You need to save that
[11951.40s -> 11959.53s]  energy for the ring. If you make this unsafe for work environment, then I'll just have to keep you
[11959.53s -> 11973.91s]  out of it. We're pleased to be joined in the studio by Mee Strip of All American Wrestling.
[11973.91s -> 11985.53s]  You ever heard of someone called Winston Barker from Maple Leaf Grappling? I'm a huge fan.
[11986.33s -> 11993.46s]  Winston Barker is an asshole. Well, let's just hope you don't bump into Winston Barker. You
[11993.46s -> 12001.18s]  might regret saying that. We never have any regrets. If you had to guess what percentage
[12001.18s -> 12006.06s]  of your matches would you say you've won throughout your career so far? This is where
[12006.70s -> 12015.06s]  Mee Strong holds up his hand and has his two, one finger up and he looks at it for a long time.
[12017.86s -> 12030.79s]  We have two. Me win two. That's exactly right. You obviously pay attention to every aspect of
[12030.79s -> 12039.22s]  this sport. How do you like working for Lance Monaco at All American Wrestling? This is him
[12039.22s -> 12051.77s]  right here. I like. Oh, Lance Monaco. We'll be happy to hear that. I'm sure you'd be there
[12051.77s -> 12060.60s]  for a long time. Lance Monaco is an asshole. You came across really well, Mee Strip. Thanks
[12060.60s -> 12076.63s]  for your time. You know, you can initiate conversations with people by taunting in
[12076.63s -> 12102.65s]  their direction. There's another person in here. What the fuck? What? Hi, Mee Strip. Do you have
[12102.65s -> 12115.48s]  time to answer some questions for an article we're writing? What box? Yes. Thanks for doing
[12115.48s -> 12122.71s]  this, Mee Strip. It'll be a great opportunity to raise your profile. Let's talk about your relations.
[12123.35s -> 12134.90s]  Who would you say your best friend is right now? Lance Monaco is my best friend. It's the last
[12134.90s -> 12143.51s]  person I talked to. Lance Monaco will be happy to hear about that. I'm sure he feels the same way.
[12145.03s -> 12149.10s]  It's literally the last person I spoke to. Tell us about your career at All American Wrestling.
[12149.10s -> 12169.18s]  How much are they paying you right now? I don't know. How much? Is it 24? 2,000. You're worth
[12169.18s -> 12176.89s]  every penny, Mee Strip. I can see you take this business seriously. Setting aside your
[12176.89s -> 12188.74s]  personal feelings, which promotion do you think has the highest TV ratings? Yes, Sun. Sun does
[12188.74s -> 12198.09s]  rise. No, Rising Sun is not. It's only at 87%. It seems you don't care what happens outside the
[12198.09s -> 12219.54s]  ring. I think you came across quite well. Thanks for your time. We're pleased to be joined in the
[12219.54s -> 12227.53s]  studio by Mee Strip of All American Wrestling. What is going on in here? You seem to have heat
[12227.53s -> 12232.41s]  with Winston Barker. So tell us how you feel about that. I just talked about my problem with
[12232.41s -> 12241.50s]  the Barker over there. I could never forgive Winston Barker. He's just sleeping. Oh, the
[12241.50s -> 12249.61s]  rivalry is never going to end. Tell us about your career at All American. How many weeks have you
[12249.61s -> 12262.20s]  have left on your contract? I have no idea. Are we 32? Exactly right. You obviously take this
[12262.20s -> 12271.24s]  business pretty seriously. Tell us how your training is going. How strong would you say you are?
[12271.80s -> 12290.73s]  Strong? Mee Strong. Mee Strong. 95%. Mee Strip. Strong? No, Mee Strip. Then I get up and start
[12290.73s -> 12297.34s]  dancing. I think you came across quite well, Mee Strip. So thanks for your time. That Mee Brother.
[12297.34s -> 12322.10s]  Twin Brother. Mee Strong. He went to sleep. I'm trying to use the phone. I don't understand how
[12322.10s -> 12364.84s]  to use the phone. Give me the skateboard. Yes, I'll use some new strikes. Good. It's important
[12364.84s -> 12370.44s]  for a fighter to adapt. I hit him in the head so hard that he I guess thought we were training.
[12370.44s -> 12404.55s]  Hello? Somebody said you factory reset him. Oh my god. Okay. All they would have discovered
[12404.55s -> 12430.60s]  a new talent known as slow petrol. I'm at 100%. $200,000. Damn. No show. Nothing scheduled.
[12430.60s -> 12436.06s]  To be fair though, let's be honest. If a caveman did come into this world, I wouldn't be surprised
[12436.06s -> 12441.67s]  if they were fascinated by a skateboard and a cell phone. So I think this actually plays this. This
[12441.67s -> 12457.22s]  is placed into the brand here. Mee Strip. I'm here to challenge you to a match on the third week of
[12457.22s -> 12486.36s]  July. Uh, on the wall? That's not me. What are you talking about? No, me tired. I should have known
[12486.36s -> 12514.71s]  to be too scared. I'll get you one day, Mee Strip. Sorry, me phone. Sorry, me need to take this.
[12514.71s -> 12537.93s]  Hello? I don't have a match today. I can do whatever I want. I think you had a rough night,
[12537.93s -> 12561.59s]  Mee Strip. Sleep on it. I've had, I'm literally at almost 100% HP. Learn to read. Barber shop.
[12561.59s -> 12581.93s]  Oh, Mattie McFly. We're friends. I got a haircut. Who's the barber? At a threat? At a threat?
[12581.93s -> 12596.54s]  Somebody cut, was somebody gonna cut my hair? Let's go. Somebody, I want my haircut.
[12596.54s -> 12608.89s]  Are you the barber? I painted a picture of me getting a haircut on this. Me want this. Me want
[12608.89s -> 12656.52s]  the beaver. How do I get a haircut? Oh, okay. You do it yourself. All right. Okay. I'll be nice,
[12656.52s -> 12670.49s]  but I won't be nice to this person. Oh, shit. All right. We're going for it. Since we're such
[12670.49s -> 12693.14s]  good friends, do you mind if I have that pipe? No. My stick. I'm tougher than you, Mee Strip.
[12693.14s -> 12713.72s]  Don't start something you can't finish. This food? What is this? What the fuck was that?
[12713.72s -> 12741.48s]  What is this? Ow. I'm going to go train other brass knuckles again. I want even more strength.
[12741.56s -> 12761.70s]  Nintendo 64? Oh, yeah. Me and Lance are friends. All right. Let's do some weightlifting. Better
[12761.70s -> 12793.78s]  attitude. That's good. I'm going run and lift at the same time. Oh, shit. That's bad. Can I
[12793.78s -> 12807.14s]  sleep here? Uh, I can sleep in the hospital. Slow down, Mee Strip. Running might get you there
[12807.14s -> 12827.18s]  quicker, but it also makes you tired. I'm going right here. This doctor always has a briefcase,
[12827.18s -> 12847.99s]  and he's always violent. 65%. That's fine. All right. This is singles hardcore match.
[12847.99s -> 12884.17s]  Bring some water, and I'm going to go beat the absolute shit out of this person. My god.
[12884.17s -> 12901.18s]  This is glass. I want this. Oh, my god. Thank god I missed.
[12901.18s -> 12909.98s]  Okay. Arena time. The arena's connected here, right? Yeah. Backstage. God. Come on. Really?
[12910.54s -> 12932.68s]  I wanted to put somebody through that. Hey, I want that belt. Can I talk to you for a second?
[12932.68s -> 12949.22s]  I want to challenge you for the belt. Why are you not paying attention to me at all? Talk to me.
[12951.59s -> 12969.64s]  Don't know a wall. I mean, kind of. Yeah. This is my turn. Not yet. All right. Hardcore match
[12969.64s -> 12987.14s]  coming up. This is my match. I'm fighting this guy right now. We haven't gone in the ring yet.
[12994.78s -> 13007.40s]  Get off me. They're waiting for us to come on stage. Oh, my god. Oh, no. That's bad. This is
[13007.40s -> 13023.74s]  bad. What are you waiting for? You need to go through the curtain now. Oh, shit. I'm getting
[13023.74s -> 13033.53s]  there. I'll get there. I'll get there. That was not the right person. I thought that was the person
[13033.53s -> 13048.31s]  I was fighting. What happened? Why? Is this for a belt? Dude, this is for a belt, I think. I think
[13048.31s -> 13054.39s]  this is... Why are there two referees? Why do referees have belts on? What the fuck is happening?
[13055.45s -> 13063.69s]  I'm sure you're all aware we're the reigning tag team champions, the referees. Unfortunately,
[13063.69s -> 13071.05s]  the competition in this division is so pathetic that we've resorted to finding our own. That's
[13071.05s -> 13075.13s]  why we're pleased to announce that we'll be granting a title shot to whoever wins this match.
[13081.93s -> 13107.26s]  Oh, shit. Please don't lose. Don't lose. I got beat up backstage by a gigantic coin.
[13107.26s -> 13137.46s]  Whatever that was. I gotta get out. Okay, I'm fine. All I gotta do is just pick this up. You
[13137.46s -> 13149.13s]  piece of shit. Give me that. Give that to me. Oh, my god. I got the belt. What if I just leave with
[13149.13s -> 13187.86s]  the belt? Can I run away with the belt? Don't. Oh, okay. What a fucking idiot. Please let me go.
[13188.26s -> 13227.85s]  Club. Yeah, it is. It's so stupid when that happens. These guys are just still standing here.
[13227.85s -> 13256.06s]  How did that catch on fire? I actually got it, thank god. The random guy with the
[13256.06s -> 13284.01s]  mustaches going up here. Careful, this thing's gonna fall. I need to... Something. There's a bat
[13284.01s -> 13308.97s]  in there, good. Get away from me. Get away, get away. Okay, I got it. I'll get the title shot now.
[13308.97s -> 13324.78s]  So, it's the tag team title? I don't have a partner. Holy shit.
[13324.78s -> 13350.90s]  It's not moving for some reason? Dude, stop doing that. I'm pinned him when he gets in the ring again.
[13367.14s -> 13370.42s]  This is fucking crazy, man. This is crazy.
[13380.07s -> 13385.16s]  You earned your shot at the tag team titles, but I don't have a partner. If what you wish for,
[13385.16s -> 13390.46s]  I'll turn your dreams into nightmares. Appreciate the opportunity, Addering Ron,
[13390.46s -> 13409.82s]  but you just made the biggest mistake of your life. Addering Ron is going to die. Oh, man.
[13410.46s -> 13438.50s]  This is always such a joke at the end of every match. It's just chaos every time.
[13438.50s -> 13458.73s]  He peeked his head out for one second, and that's all it took.
[13458.73s -> 13469.35s]  You in a little bit of music? I'm being limited by this organization.
[13474.23s -> 13484.55s]  I got a piece of that pie, right? Yeah. Nice.
[13485.27s -> 13495.46s]  Congratulations on winning your third match, Mestrip. You remain undefeated at all American
[13495.46s -> 13503.24s]  wrestling. Hey, thanks for the congratulations. Appreciate it. I've been starting fights,
[13503.24s -> 13511.30s]  you need to save that energy for the ring. So, I actually should be careful. They'll probably
[13511.30s -> 13528.38s]  kick me out. Yeah, I'm going to get kicked out if I don't stop. Of course, I threw it at the
[13528.38s -> 13551.51s]  magician or whoever that guy is. I'm going to stop, I promise. I'm not going to kill anybody.
[13552.23s -> 13565.38s]  Addering Ron's stamina has improved. Damn.
[13569.19s -> 13575.35s]  Wait, Bentley has developed a heated rivalry with Mike Bale of wrestling school. He's not
[13575.35s -> 13598.38s]  going to be the announcer. Okay. What's going on this week? Geez. What do you think of the
[13598.38s -> 13620.82s]  new hairstyle our stylist suggested for you? Yeah, I was going to say that. It's too clean.
[13621.78s -> 13632.74s]  It's over. Somebody says he's going corporate. Okay, no show here. I can roam around.
[13632.74s -> 13664.94s]  I'm still here. It's a weird shot. Why did I just puke? What was that? What's wrong with me?
[13664.94s -> 13698.41s]  I don't understand what just happened. All right. Can I take a shower? What? What are you two looking
[13698.41s -> 13725.85s]  at? You, you're a giant coin. Get out of here. I didn't start any fight. Okay. So I, does this
[13725.85s -> 13742.46s]  count as a shower? Should, right? I think that counts. Oh, I guess I go speaking of toilets. I
[13742.46s -> 13748.28s]  gotta go pee. All right. I'm staring at me. I've never seen somebody go to the toilet with fully
[13748.28s -> 13793.42s]  clothes. What is it, dude? What's going on? It's just, it's mayhem. This whole game is mayhem.
[13796.65s -> 13806.74s]  Fully clothed. I'm wearing a pair of underwear. These two hate each other. Look at this. They want
[13806.74s -> 13830.58s]  to fight so bad. What? This is not a dick, right? Is there a dick? No. What? I don't even know what
[13830.58s -> 13843.38s]  just happened, but I didn't mean to do that. Okay. I get, I'm out of here. These people are freaking
[13843.38s -> 13889.10s]  me out. Come on. I'm losing weight. Yeah. There's no match schedule, so I'm good. Anything you want
[13889.10s -> 13904.71s]  to talk about? Why am I setting up a shot at pool? Oh, that's right. I can't, I stopped starting
[13904.71s -> 13939.21s]  fights. You're right. That's really stupid of me. I think they got one of my attention, but
[13939.29s -> 13950.34s]  that title match is coming up too. Vstrip's influence has inspired everybody else in the
[13950.34s -> 13959.72s]  All-American Wrestling roster to improve their stamina. Eight-man tag team match. How is this
[13959.72s -> 13963.61s]  going to work? All right. This is going to be insane. I'll be back. I'm going to pee.
[13964.49s -> 14167.48s]  I'll see you guys in like two minutes. Here, pee. Eight-man tag. I don't know if this is going to
[14167.48s -> 14192.44s]  work, but apparently it is. Okay. That's good. Good. So I'm going to just, 8 PM. So that's pretty
[14192.44s -> 14206.62s]  quick. Wow. That's one way to get out of bed. Holy shit. That's like the government CIA training.
[14206.62s -> 14222.98s]  Like that's like secret agent training to do that. That's insane. American dad. Yeah. All right. I
[14222.98s -> 14231.22s]  got full health. I'm not going to, what's wrong with me? Why am I swaying around? Did you wash
[14231.22s -> 14240.54s]  your hands? Of course I did. Climb to improve. Oh, all right. That's cool. Glad I could influence
[14240.54s -> 14245.10s]  your look, me strip. I was wondering, I was worried that my legacy would be forgotten. Why
[14245.18s -> 14262.18s]  I took this guy's haircut? Hold on. We have the same haircut. Eating and drinking is good for
[14262.18s -> 14272.06s]  energy boost, but you'll make yourself sick if you're full. I appreciate it. Jester. We actually
[14272.06s -> 14290.23s]  have the same haircut. I don't even know who this is. What happened? What? Why did I puke?
[14294.01s -> 14300.22s]  He just told you? Yeah. I didn't think. I just woke up. I slept for nine hours and I wake up
[14300.22s -> 14303.82s]  and I have a fucking apple and I throw up because I have too much food in my stomach.
[14306.74s -> 14317.90s]  What are you on about? What do you want about game? Oh shit. My match. This banana was on fire.
[14334.12s -> 14351.08s]  Get out of here. All right. It's okay. It's an eight man tag match. I'll be fine. Who's on my team?
[14351.08s -> 14371.05s]  Just me. This is shit's going on in the ring right now. There are more than eight people here. One,
[14371.05s -> 14381.02s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. There are like 12 people here. There are way too many
[14381.10s -> 14396.71s]  people in the ring. Legal. What? Hold on. Um, do we even know who's on whose team?
[14403.58s -> 14415.82s]  Okay. Apparently it's just me. These two, I think it's just me and this guy. They're not all against
[14415.82s -> 14432.92s]  me, right? I don't think so. Take them all out. Oh, that's illegal. That's illegal. I gotta get rid
[14432.92s -> 14489.67s]  of this. Take one step forward. I actually look naked. Danny DeVito coming out of the couch. Nice.
[14490.23s -> 14509.40s]  Pretty good horse tactic. Stunner. Let's go. So what's, is there balls count anywhere or
[14509.96s -> 14526.57s]  let's find out who's even on my team. Me strip looks like my father and it's weird.
[14527.88s -> 14549.69s]  That's really weird, dude. It's weird. It's dad. Okay. Count it.
[14553.58s -> 14559.18s]  What the hell was the point of all these people? What a joke. Why were they all here?
[14559.18s -> 14568.15s]  And now you're all in big trouble. Ain't nobody getting out of here alive.
[14590.68s -> 14608.42s]  No one's getting out. Oh shit. They get no lock on is just so hard to switch between people.
[14609.30s -> 14628.84s]  Okay. So what about my status? There were two teams. I guess you're going to get fired. No,
[14628.84s -> 14643.80s]  am I? I don't think so. We're almost at the top, almost 90%. We're almost at number one.
[14643.80s -> 14660.20s]  I got 10 grand. That Stunner is a nice finisher. I can't wait to kick out of it. Oh, I can't wait
[14660.20s -> 14667.40s]  to kick out of it. What's the point of this game? Become the best wrestler in the world.
[14674.06s -> 14705.29s]  I wasn't even going to use it. I didn't do anything. This guy, this dude's AI is probably
[14705.29s -> 14710.10s]  going to throw that eventually here. I want to be nowhere near it. I didn't do any of this. I have
[14710.10s -> 14721.38s]  nothing to do with this. People just squaring up in a lobby. Yeah, this is like the beginning
[14721.38s -> 14731.56s]  of a Fortnite game. We're waiting to drop out of the bus. Oh, here we go. Here we go. This is
[14731.56s -> 14737.43s]  at start. It just started. There he is. That's the guy with the dynamite in his hand. You know he's
[14737.43s -> 14743.94s]  going to throw it. There he is. He's going to take a little too much punishment and he's going to
[14743.94s -> 14763.99s]  throw it. Only a matter of time. He's not throwing it. He's smart. All right. I'm out. I need to go
[14763.99s -> 14786.22s]  to sleep. Jesus. All right. Goodbye. Where's the phone? It's on the ground somewhere. Who knows?
[14791.83s -> 14800.04s]  Get the fuck away from me. Is it by the trash? Where is it? There's the phone.
[14800.60s -> 14829.03s]  I was over here. It sounded like it was on the right side. All right. Hotel room. So when does
[14829.03s -> 14845.03s]  the title shot happen? I feel like that was like an hour and a half ago. Why are you sleeping in
[14845.03s -> 14881.62s]  a crib? We had a confrontation. I'm curious. I don't know what it is. Why did I get consciousness
[14882.42s -> 14893.22s]  when Mee Strong was just like a dumb guy that yelled, I hit you. Somebody gave him
[14893.22s -> 14909.26s]  consciousness. I always get a haircut. What do you want? Mee Strip, I'm tired of being mentioned
[14909.26s -> 14916.52s]  the same breath as you. It's time to change the conversation. Everybody talks about me like I'm
[14916.52s -> 14922.95s]  your inferior, but we both know that I've always been your superior. Down with this sort of thing.
[14922.95s -> 14926.39s]  I'm sure you would prefer me to stay in the shadows, but my light is too bright for that.
[14927.03s -> 14934.84s]  Don't worry about shadows too much because you won't be seeing any more of those after I knock
[14934.84s -> 14964.01s]  your lights out. What do you mean? What do you mean? She's got a weapon. Oh my goodness,
[14964.01s -> 14969.53s]  that was brutal. That was horrible. Oh my God. All right. I did it. I did it. I beat you up.
[14969.53s -> 14986.76s]  I did it. I'm good. I'm good. I did it. Poor guy. I don't want to... That was the guy with the
[14986.76s -> 15019.70s]  dynamite by the way. I guess I... Fine. Oh shit. How did we stop? Okay. I did it. I'm done. Bro,
[15019.70s -> 15045.13s]  back off. Okay. All right. That was it. Okay. Goodbye. Oh my God. Oh shit. Okay. I might
[15045.13s -> 15061.98s]  actually lose. Me strong never loses by the way. Well, when does this stop? It was like,
[15061.98s -> 15071.24s]  oh, a confrontation. I'll beat you up. Okay. We've concluded that we both have been beaten up.
[15071.24s -> 15102.58s]  We've concluded that we beat each other up. Is it a pin? I don't think so. That hurts.
[15102.66s -> 15126.25s]  That really hurts. I just damaged all my internal organs. I just have it out for this guy. I don't
[15126.25s -> 15145.08s]  know why. Stop starting fights. It's... But it's like GTA in Grand Theft Auto. When you're walking
[15145.08s -> 15167.78s]  around and it's just a person that you just like run into them. They went down. Okay. We'd make a
[15167.78s -> 15171.46s]  pretty good team, me strip. How would you like to make it a regular thing? This is the guy that I've
[15171.46s -> 15186.65s]  been beating up every day. We can make a much bigger impact together. You know what? Yeah. Sure.
[15187.21s -> 15214.10s]  I need a tag team partner for the tag team championship. This is it. All right. This is
[15214.10s -> 15220.68s]  the big one. Tag team championship. I kind of feel like an idiot because I've probably brought this
[15220.68s -> 15227.94s]  guy's health and stamina down by like 80% of the last three days. This guy gets no rest. I see him
[15227.94s -> 15233.50s]  and I attack him. I've hit this guy in the head with more objects than are currently in my office
[15233.50s -> 15243.69s]  right now. I'm kind of causing a problem for myself. What is gimmick? Gimmick I think is just
[15243.69s -> 15258.84s]  your kind of character sheet. All right. Tag team championship. You still have the... Okay. Let's go.
[15258.84s -> 15267.53s]  I'll see you when we... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on a minute. Hold on
[15267.53s -> 15276.54s]  a minute. Can you get it? No, you cannot. No. What just happened? Why did he just fall down?
[15280.38s -> 15298.42s]  What did he just do? He just fell over. He attacked her? Why? We don't have... We don't
[15298.42s -> 15305.37s]  try to make problems with other people. All right. I don't want to mess around. Hey Meshrip,
[15305.37s -> 15317.50s]  can I have that phone? Sure. I'm roaming right now so don't make any long-distance calls.
[15317.50s -> 15324.46s]  I know exactly what I'm going to do with it. Make a phone call. That was so threatening for no reason.
[15326.70s -> 15339.67s]  It's a 2000 like one joke. Oh please. Thanks for the phone back. All right. I think I dialed the
[15339.67s -> 15355.26s]  wrong number. I was hoping to speak to Karen Mahoney. Who did you call? I didn't... It wasn't
[15355.26s -> 15379.82s]  me. It was somebody else. Nice try. Where's my tag team partner? Any minute now we're going on
[15379.82s -> 15396.71s]  stage. I just keep thinking of that guy's dad. I don't know why. Like this guy's dad in chat.
[15399.05s -> 15403.96s]  I don't know why it's freaking me out. I don't know where my partner is but we gotta go.
[15404.52s -> 15415.50s]  This is for the tag team championship. Meshrip and Bubba Hyena. All right. Yeah, there you are.
[15415.50s -> 15440.86s]  Bubba Hyena and I have joined forces to become even greater than the sum of our parts.
[15445.48s -> 15449.64s]  All the other teams in All American Wrestling better watch out because we just raised the bar.
[15449.64s -> 15456.55s]  That's right but actions speak louder than words so let's show these people what they
[15456.55s -> 15480.78s]  what we're about. You idiot. Dumbass. I'm gonna do that again. Look where the... Where are you
[15480.78s -> 15491.59s]  fucking going? I think that seriously the person... I don't even... People on the other team right now
[15491.59s -> 15516.15s]  like seriously need to shut the fuck up. Okay. You might tap out from this I think. Whoa! I caught
[15516.15s -> 15563.77s]  his leg in midair. Oh no. Oh no. This is it. That was so long. I'm joking.
[15574.04s -> 15581.96s]  They're not even fighting. What are they doing over there? He's like rubbing his leg. What the fuck?
[15582.20s -> 15596.74s]  Oh that was so dumb. That was so long.
[15601.45s -> 15605.29s]  You can't tell me those two were seriously just sitting there lying down.
[15617.72s -> 15632.81s]  You guys are gonna kill me. Stop. Oh all right. Let's get back to reality here. Oh god damn.
[15651.37s -> 15668.94s]  No. The crowd is silent. It was just like an awkward... I don't like... Like this was bad.
[15668.94s -> 15678.38s]  This sucked. What a shitty match. Four people just like lying down like next to each other.
[15679.42s -> 15705.58s]  Why am I still joking? Okay I gotta get up.
[15705.58s -> 15742.17s]  Oh okay. I'm getting out of here. I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[15744.33s -> 15751.00s]  Music. Oh it's... All right. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Enough.
[15757.66s -> 15768.23s]  Oh we're just lying down. Everybody in the... Honestly what really kept me going there is the
[15768.23s -> 15779.98s]  audience is just quiet man. Quiet. Silent. It's like god damn. That was the tag team championship.
[15779.98s -> 15800.06s]  You got two guys coming out in like fucking gimp suits. We're just lying down. Okay and then you
[15800.06s -> 15818.92s]  kept going. I don't know man. It was just... Got those belts on though. You believe we're tag team
[15818.92s -> 15834.52s]  champions? Look how far we've come together. Yeah we have. Shake hands. All right. Okay.
[15835.32s -> 15844.01s]  Somebody's jealous. Where are you taking him? Where are you taking him? I'm on my way to the hotel.
[15844.01s -> 15855.82s]  You need a ride? Um sure. We can walk across the street. Just follow me and I'll get you to the
[15855.82s -> 15867.38s]  hotel as soon as possible. Bro it's across the street. We're gonna both walk there. What do you
[15867.38s -> 15882.42s]  want? What are you doing? Okay it's friendly. Why do you have that? Well I don't want you looking at
[15882.42s -> 15908.97s]  this. I'm putting this somewhere safe. Just go to bed. Whatever. What are you doing out this late?
[15908.97s -> 15915.37s]  You should probably get to get a good night's sleep. I'm about to do that. Can I have a title
[15915.37s -> 15946.95s]  shot? What was that? Why am I holding the championship belt? Am I asleep? Am I having like
[15946.95s -> 15978.20s]  memories? Like flashbacks? Go to bed. Go to sleep. Boomtown has been released by Wrestling Revolution.
[15978.20s -> 15989.53s]  Oh no. Why Tides feud with MeStripped peers who have lost momentum is no longer over with the fans.
[15990.17s -> 15997.22s]  What happened to my health? After five hours of comfortable sleep, MeStripped's energy levels
[15997.22s -> 16004.66s]  are 84%. What happened? MeStripped has come down with an illness and is in poor health this week.
[16011.11s -> 16029.08s]  That didn't die in my sleep right? No ring tag elimination? But uh look at me. He's gonna have
[16029.08s -> 16038.62s]  to carry. Your energy looks a little low. Find something. You can't eat that. That's not edible.
[16038.62s -> 16044.25s]  Bro that's not. Bro he's trying to kill me. He's trying to kill me. Get him. He poisoned me in my
[16044.25s -> 16054.06s]  sleep. He poisoned me in my sleep. Tell him to kill him. How could you do this to me? What?
[16054.86s -> 16064.14s]  What's happening? Help. Help. He's killing us. I need to have. Why don't you wear the same costume
[16064.14s -> 16070.34s]  as me? What are you talking about? No you should dress like me. Who's talking here? I don't want
[16070.34s -> 16094.65s]  to dress like you. Let's just leave things as they are. I know I'll be fine. You may have beaten me
[16094.65s -> 16098.17s]  in the ring but the result will be different outside the ring. This he poisoned me in my sleep
[16098.17s -> 16110.71s]  and he tried to kill my friend. Stop him. Stop him. I'm clinging to my last. The belt will always
[16110.71s -> 16129.56s]  be mine even in death. You don't want trouble? You shouldn't have fucking poisoned me. Get him.
[16129.56s -> 16156.55s]  Nice job. He's not talking to me right? Why am I sad in the corner? Um somebody help? I feel like
[16156.55s -> 16161.93s]  this is the one ring. Oh my god we have to get in the ring. I feel like Gollum right now. All right
[16161.93s -> 16173.98s]  we gotta go. We have to go. I need food. I need something to eat quick. I need water or something.
[16173.98s -> 16196.34s]  Food. Water. Leave me the fuck alone. Unless you have food. Food. Is there water on the ground?
[16196.34s -> 16207.30s]  I need a water bottle or something. Anything. Anything. What the fuck? Battering happens to be
[16207.30s -> 16236.09s]  a friend of mine. I just you don't. Dude let me up. Where's my tag partner? Square the fucking balls.
[16236.49s -> 16251.22s]  Whose phone? Um we have a match. Please. Is there anybody have any water? Is there any water or
[16251.22s -> 16264.50s]  anything? Food. Grapes. I'll take bananas. Oh shit. Me Strip and Graffiti? Who's Graffiti? Where's my
[16264.50s -> 16269.93s]  tag partner? Last week Graffiti and I became the new tag team champions. That's not their name.
[16270.89s -> 16278.55s]  It was like Bobby Hyena. We told everybody we're the best when we first got together and now it's
[16278.55s -> 16288.12s]  official. That's my partner. We're going to bring legitimacy back to tag wrestling. Am I shit faced?
[16289.72s -> 16293.96s]  Don't expect us to break up anytime soon because the only teams we break up are our opponents.
[16293.96s -> 16299.93s]  No my guy's over here. We got to the top sticking together and that chemistry would keep us at the
[16299.93s -> 16312.84s]  top. This is my guy right here. I'm holding the other end of the belt. I'm not going over there.
[16312.92s -> 16331.82s]  They can fucking kill each other for all I care. Oh god. Get away from me. Get away. Get away. Get
[16331.82s -> 16346.78s]  away. If you want to hit me you're gonna have to go through Bobby Hyena. That guy has water? He does.
[16351.51s -> 16363.85s]  Jesus Christ. I'm gonna die. No he's drinking it in front of me to like just spite me. Do you see that?
[16365.34s -> 16388.39s]  No please. I was too heavy. Give me that water. Give me that water now. Give me the water. No I
[16388.39s -> 16406.17s]  don't want this useless piece of junk. Where's the water? You guys have water over here? They might.
[16406.17s -> 16419.46s]  They're like a commentary table. No I think we need to break this up. I just want water. I just
[16419.46s -> 16434.87s]  give me the water. He's sitting there just drinking and taunting me with it. This guy is get step on
[16434.87s -> 16442.54s]  him. Stomp. He's somebody he's gonna win this fight right now. You guys understand the gravity
[16442.54s -> 16449.94s]  of this situation right now? Give me that fucking water you dumb ass clown. Give me the water.
[16450.66s -> 16485.90s]  I got it. You piece of shit drank the whole goddamn thing. How is anybody gonna get pinned? This lady
[16485.90s -> 16499.64s]  was just watching. I think it's yeah I can pin somebody if I can just get the bat. Get him off
[16499.64s -> 16519.38s]  me please. Somebody. This is it. Ready? Just no one's gonna get pinned. Just go sit in the chair.
[16519.38s -> 16537.94s]  I'm gonna count it. I'm actually still on the ground. Let's just leave the match. I think I'll
[16537.94s -> 16554.70s]  lose my tag team belt won't I? Is this a championship match or no? I have no idea. What
[16554.70s -> 16580.86s]  are you doing? If I can pin the joker I'll be fine. I hear a fire. Give me that fucking belt.
[16580.86s -> 16604.15s]  Come out here without me. Pretending like we're not a goddamn team. Give me that pin. Count it.
[16604.15s -> 16645.66s]  Why is the ref on fire? That's it. He's serious. This guy has zero HP. Zero. You're talking into
[16645.66s -> 16664.68s]  the microphone. Dude. Both of you idiots. It's gonna have to be the jester. It's got a Nintendo
[16664.68s -> 16702.30s]  64 and the belt. Get up. Am I? Is he about to leave the match? Spin him around. Oh my god. Get a pin.
[16702.30s -> 16738.65s]  That should be it. Thank god. One. What? I don't get it. I don't understand. I have to eliminate
[16738.65s -> 16756.55s]  the partners? Oh that's annoying. You know something? This lady, Sharon, has not been
[16756.55s -> 16768.41s]  fighting at all. She still has the belt around her waist. Really? We'll turn the lights off.
[16768.41s -> 16788.07s]  Why is the power out? Nobody got the power. Now we're friends? After all that bullshit?
[16788.07s -> 16805.21s]  Now you come and raise my hand? After all that? Really? What the hell was that? Um. I don't know
[16805.21s -> 16808.41s]  who that was. Somebody shook my hand and I fucking hit him in the head with the bat. I don't know
[16808.41s -> 16828.30s]  what that was. They freaked me out. I thought they were grabbing me. So I'm hurt again. I'm still
[16828.30s -> 16844.42s]  sick. All right. We got, that's not a bad rating. Who's graffiti? I, I have no idea, man. I really
[16844.42s -> 16856.87s]  don't. I think the game bugged out and thought we were tag team partners. I have both belts,
[16856.87s -> 16871.62s]  which is weird. You want your belt? Take your belt back, man. Yeah. Here. Take your, take that back.
[16871.62s -> 16890.84s]  That's yours. Okay. Glitter Andy. I want the phone. Okay. I'm out. I don't know this guy. I don't know
[16890.84s -> 16896.42s]  what this guy's doing. Oh yeah. We have the same haircut. I remember you and I were cool.
[16896.98s -> 16950.94s]  Please go to the doctor. Um, okay. If you want, I'm gonna do it for you. That's weird. All right.
[16950.94s -> 16961.72s]  Into the hospital bed. Good night. I don't know why the doctor is hostile since the very beginning.
[16961.72s -> 16966.28s]  It's like Dark Souls. I R1ed him three times and he just is permanently hostile towards me. I don't
[16966.28s -> 16980.12s]  know why. All right. I think I'm back in better health. You should talk to him. Meestrip, what do
[16980.12s -> 16985.77s]  you think of the new outfit our wardrobe department created for you? Let's see it.
[16998.57s -> 17004.41s]  No. You obviously don't know anything about fashion. This is what all the kids are wearing
[17004.41s -> 17027.54s]  these days. We're gonna defend the belts. 10 PM today. What? Hello? Wait. Hello? If you're looking
[17027.54s -> 17054.76s]  for a Yuri Yakuza, I saw him in the bar. Okay. Motherfuckers at the bar. Listen, I'm not sure
[17054.76s -> 17062.14s]  the name Meestrip captures the essence of your character. How would you like to be something
[17062.14s -> 17076.38s]  called something like Glitter Cesar? No. Did I make you sound like you have a choice? Your name
[17076.38s -> 17087.94s]  is Glitter Cesar now. Get used to it. I thought we were friends. All right. Where's this person
[17087.94s -> 17104.74s]  that the phone said go find this person? Where is this person? Oh, I don't know what you did that
[17104.74s -> 17126.42s]  for. I don't have any idea. Why did you do that? I can't miss this. This is the tag. Oh my god. What
[17126.42s -> 17137.67s]  happened? Am I? What happened? My god, what happened? What? Oh my health. Help. Somebody help me.
[17139.10s -> 17152.73s]  What the fuck? This is a, this is a championship match. What do you mean take a nap? Huh? You piece
[17152.73s -> 17160.01s]  of fucking shit. Who did that? Okay. Redneck Rosteen. Remember that. I hit my head on the
[17160.01s -> 17173.94s]  asphalt. Yeah. Oh god damn it. The show is about to start. Where's the entrance? Where's the
[17173.94s -> 17191.54s]  entrance? That was bullshit. It really was. Really? This is such a crock of shit. No way.
[17193.48s -> 17207.27s]  No way. Brain is leaking. Somebody said nice Tony Hawk hair. Glitter Cesar and Bubba Hyena. No,
[17207.27s -> 17231.16s]  that's not my name. Why are we fighting against these guys again? We're fighting. We just beat
[17231.16s -> 17236.68s]  you. You're too young to be a champion Glitter Cesar. You haven't got a clue what that responsibility
[17236.68s -> 17242.44s]  means. Last thing is more of a marathon than a sprint and that's why I've been awarded the gold
[17242.44s -> 17262.12s]  medal. I'm not doing all right. Oops. I need to, I need to tag out. Tag out. Thank you. All right,
[17262.12s -> 17288.98s]  go get him. How am I? I just, what? I just tagged him. Didn't I just tag his hand? The ref didn't
[17288.98s -> 17301.66s]  see it. Where's the other? Where's his teammate? Come on. Tag. Tag. There we go. All right. You know
[17301.66s -> 17316.94s]  what to do. Oh, good. Good exchange. Get back in there. You got full health, man. You got to take,
[17316.94s -> 17326.84s]  you got to take care of this. I'm going to go see, go sit down. That's a good idea. Um, money mark.
[17326.84s -> 17334.76s]  I need you to get out of that chair. Why am I getting counted out? I'm not even the legal
[17334.76s -> 17348.86s]  person here. I'm not. What are you talking about? What? Get, no, tag back in. Get back up here.
[17355.18s -> 17371.50s]  Get in there. Excuse me? What the hell? Help. He's going to beat us.
[17380.04s -> 17387.88s]  I can't even get up. Help. This is the championship. You can't do this.
[17391.11s -> 17396.79s]  Tag in. Thank you. Jesus. Don't tag me out. I need to go sit in the chair and relax.
[17401.64s -> 17411.08s]  Get me out of here. Roll out of the ring. Where are you going with this table?
[17414.46s -> 17430.39s]  I can't move. I, I mean, he's, I can't, I'd love to get up. Okay. Do not tag me in, dude. Please
[17433.05s -> 17465.56s]  spend one goddamn minute fighting the other guy. This is actually working. This is the worst fight
[17465.56s -> 17488.58s]  ever. Is there a drink on the ground? There is. Where is there, where do you see a drink by the
[17488.58s -> 17506.34s]  chair? I can't see it. It's a microphone. It's gotta be like a fucking water back here or something.
[17506.34s -> 17523.70s]  I'm stuck in the chair. Get up and stop moving. All right. I'm whatever. I'll tag me in and I'm
[17523.70s -> 17553.56s]  going to get the shit out of this guy. Now let's go to the right of the chair. Stop climbing. Oh
[17553.56s -> 17564.33s]  my God. Stop climbing. Ref didn't see it. Ref didn't see it. Okay. Okay. Ref didn't see it.
[17571.37s -> 17578.87s]  Get in the ring. Why are you going in the crowd? You're going to lose us the championship if you
[17578.87s -> 17594.41s]  don't get the fuck in the ring right now. I'm still on the ground. I'm not getting up anytime
[17594.41s -> 17624.18s]  soon. I think I'm, I am desperately trying to get up here. Is there a fight out here?
[17629.45s -> 17648.54s]  I don't know what's happening. Machine learning. Yeah, it does feel like it. Um, I don't know.
[17650.65s -> 17661.90s]  We might lose the championship here. Okay. How do I do it in the ring?
[17664.38s -> 17673.32s]  Come on. Like a fish out of water. Seriously, you just pulled me out of the ocean.
[17673.64s -> 17685.62s]  Like put me back in the ocean, please. I blame the guy. Seriously, the guy that
[17685.62s -> 17690.38s]  grabbed me and hit my head on the pavement just fucked me all up. And you know what?
[17691.53s -> 17697.32s]  I'm, I don't care anymore. I don't give a shit. I'm hitting this guy. I'm going to crush this.
[17698.04s -> 17705.46s]  Okay. Nevermind. Apparently I'm covered in like slippery cooking oil. I can't do anything.
[17708.66s -> 17715.72s]  My whole body is covered in vegetable oil. Sit in the chair. Dude, I would love to just walk up
[17715.72s -> 17744.46s]  this. Okay. There I am. That was a threat. You know what? Just tag me in. You're obviously
[17744.46s -> 17757.40s]  fucking useless. This guy doesn't understand who we should be fighting. They're just walking in
[17757.40s -> 17764.17s]  random direction. This is really bad for you to tag me in, but you know what? I at least have a
[17764.17s -> 17797.50s]  brain. That was a great save actually. Good. Okay. Yeah, sure. Come on in. We can, we can do a tag
[17797.50s -> 17826.14s]  team here. Now I'm going to go sit in the chair. I just need 10% of my health. Oh my God. We're
[17826.14s -> 17836.54s]  okay. All right. I have enough health. Now I'm not, I'm like not sloppy. This should be fine now.
[17851.99s -> 17857.98s]  All right. There we go. Now I can actually do moves. That's a rope break. Let me know.
[17857.98s -> 17889.30s]  Appreciate the help. Thank you. Beautiful. Let's get that pin. Who's drinking? You. No, give me
[17889.30s -> 17905.64s]  that. Stop drinking it. Why? Why? Why have all the time? It's been like 10 straight minutes
[17905.64s -> 17919.10s]  in this match of all the times for you to do that stupid shit. That's going to be it.
[17919.10s -> 17950.06s]  God damn it. Be careful. You're walking into enemy territory. Get that twist that leg. Oh my fucking
[17950.06s -> 17987.13s]  God. Pin. This guy is unstoppable. I can't hurt him. All right. Choke him. I don't know what's
[17987.13s -> 17999.98s]  happening, but I think I got it. Keep him occupied and this is it. There it is. Hell yeah. That was
[17999.98s -> 18022.02s]  some clutch performance by Bobby Hyena. Okay. I don't know what that was about. We can keep our
[18022.02s -> 18055.00s]  belts. Referee. Okay. We're good. I got to go. Yeah. Go after the guy that tried to assassinate
[18055.00s -> 18082.10s]  you. Yup. Bobby. Yup. Change the name back. I don't think I can. Now I'm very pissed off.
[18082.10s -> 18091.54s]  I'm out for blood now. I don't care how much sleep I haven't had. I don't care how tired I am.
[18093.08s -> 18109.48s]  Where is he? Where is that piece of shit? Not here. Over the bar. I'll find you. No, he's not in
[18109.48s -> 18149.40s]  there. No. Where are you? Oh no. That's all I need. I need 20% health. I'll be fine. All American
[18149.40s -> 18159.94s]  wrestling's proposed TV taping on the second week of September has been canceled. Tag team submission?
[18160.66s -> 18182.94s]  Oh, he slept in the street the whole time. Okay. It's going to tail him for a sec.
[18189.77s -> 18200.25s]  You got nothing to say? Well, yeah. Doctor's going to have a lot to say about what happens
[18200.25s -> 18224.74s]  to your face. Get him. Get him. This guy's probably been a menace to everybody. Excuse me?
[18229.75s -> 18235.72s]  Where is he? Get over here. I'm more skillful than you, Cesar. Don't start something you can't
[18235.72s -> 18247.21s]  finish. I'm putting you in the hospital. You're faster than me? Would you have a race? You better
[18247.21s -> 18258.10s]  not fucking break my neck. Find your own business, Glitter Cesar. If you want to be a hero, you'll
[18258.10s -> 18267.34s]  die like one. I've got no problem with you. My problem is with this guy. All right. You proved
[18267.34s -> 18271.02s]  your point. I don't want to make trouble. Well, that would be nice if... You got a match today?
[18271.58s -> 18282.98s]  Hey, dude. Hey, bro. You got a match today? Get away from me. Yeah, dude. I'm just curious.
[18291.48s -> 18302.84s]  Okay. I need to eat. Oh my God. I'm at zero health again. I actually need to go in the hospital. I
[18302.84s -> 18316.55s]  don't care. I could be an hour or two hours late to the match. I don't care. I can't believe that.
[18316.55s -> 18324.46s]  No, please leave me alone. Why am I holding my ass? What's wrong? What's wrong? Do I need to go to
[18324.46s -> 18353.13s]  the bathroom? Shut up. No, I can't eat this. Okay. Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry. I just shit my pants.
[18364.34s -> 18370.26s]  You gotta be kidding me. What? This is impossible. That's not possible. That's impossible.
[18371.14s -> 18378.10s]  It's impossible. You shit yourself. What? No. No. Don't believe those rumors. Don't believe those
[18378.10s -> 18387.86s]  rumors. That didn't happen. Those are disgusting rumors and I will not have them spread anymore.
[18400.70s -> 18409.03s]  You remind me the tag team champions this long by ducking me. Everybody knows that I'm the biggest
[18409.03s -> 18416.58s]  threat to that little title you've been up against. What is it? I'm so confused. You can't put it off
[18416.58s -> 18429.21s]  any longer and now prove why you were right to fear me. My weapons are not allowed, obviously.
[18441.13s -> 18447.29s]  Imagine shit your pants and not even like going and wiping your ass and going right into a ring
[18448.01s -> 18467.77s]  and doing a wrestling like theatrical routine. I didn't even change the pants. I'm not doing bad.
[18467.77s -> 18473.40s]  I just have to exchange it. You know what I mean? Like just me strong is all about the right-handed
[18473.40s -> 18481.00s]  exchange. In fact, you know what? You go in, please. Glitter shitter. That's not any water
[18481.00s -> 18494.79s]  down here. You guys have water? That guy chugged a water last time. I want it. Where is it? The
[18494.79s -> 18521.83s]  other guy that was here chugged a water. Please get off. There's no water. Oh my god. I just I
[18521.83s -> 18555.59s]  don't want to climb up. Oh fuck it. Whatever. There's nothing here. God damn it. You're doing
[18555.59s -> 18564.12s]  so good too actually. I'm trying to get out. You don't understand officer. You don't understand.
[18564.12s -> 18590.65s]  Where are you going? Weapons are not allowed. I gotta get this qualified. I don't care.
[18590.65s -> 18615.30s]  Wait. It's not illegal if I do it. That's correct, right? Oh my god. He didn't see it, did he?
[18620.42s -> 18644.33s]  God. My back. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. Here we go. Come here. Get the fuck
[18644.33s -> 18674.90s]  out of here. Oh he's trying to hit the referee. Where am I? He's got me in the headlock. No.
[18675.86s -> 18696.49s]  Dude did shit just pop out? I just saw like brown splatters. Okay. I think I'm good. I am good. I'm
[18696.49s -> 18723.85s]  good. There's a bat right here. I'm gonna use it. I'm gonna use it very well. Oh shit. No. I gotta
[18723.85s -> 18757.32s]  help my friend. I gotta help my friend. I gotta help my friend. Pin. Pin. Pin. Pin. Pin. Pin. There
[18757.32s -> 18765.22s]  are more viewers in chat than there are in the whole arena. All right. I think he's got this in
[18765.22s -> 18778.49s]  the bag. I think. Why am I swaying? Oh now you're fucked. Now you're fucked man. Big mistake.
[18779.21s -> 18809.27s]  I'll make sure you have as little HP as I do. All right. Get. All right. Tag me in. Tag me in.
[18809.27s -> 18830.38s]  Tag me in. Tag me in. Right here. I'm trying to kick him so bad. All right. Tag. Come on. I'm right
[18830.38s -> 18843.42s]  here. That's illegal. What he just did was illegal. Tag me in dude. What are you doing? Are you all
[18843.42s -> 18853.32s]  right? Is that illegal? Oh my god. I think I killed that guy. Oh no. That's the ref. He's
[18853.32s -> 18870.38s]  seriously injured. I seriously injured the ref. What do we do? What do we do? What do we do about
[18870.38s -> 18891.06s]  this? Okay. I'm gonna break his ankle. Break it. What? All right. Pin this guy. I'm gonna pin this
[18891.06s -> 18895.98s]  guy right now. Get out. We gotta get out. With both of them we're gonna get double disqualified. I
[18895.98s -> 18925.43s]  can't let go. No. Get out of the ring. Get out of the ring. What was that sound? Hit that pin.
[18925.91s -> 18942.07s]  He's writhing on the ground in pain. Bleeding. Everyone's bloody. This is so fucked up.
[18951.13s -> 18961.30s]  I had to get in. I gotta get in the ring. I would love to be tagged. Oh my god. He hit him in the
[18961.30s -> 18973.98s]  head with a dumbbell. Dude. That was fucked up. What? He's kicking him out. He's kicking this guy
[18974.06s -> 18980.20s]  out. He kicked. That guy didn't do anything by the way. Graffiti is this guy in the middle.
[18981.78s -> 18996.90s]  There. Oh my god. We're gonna win. Why did he throw? This guy's been thrown. Oh my god. This
[18996.90s -> 19003.14s]  fucking scientist over here is just cosplaying as us. He's wearing our belts. He threw the wrong
[19003.14s -> 19022.17s]  guy out. Pin. No. No. No. I gotta let this play out. This is bad. I don't want to just go off
[19022.17s -> 19039.96s]  on myself. Come tag me in. I would love you to tag me in. Come tag me in please. You've been in
[19039.96s -> 19059.13s]  for so long. Tag me in so I can finish this once and for all. This guy. I'm not your teammate.
[19059.13s -> 19088.58s]  I think you might be hallucinating. Is the ref okay? Oh my goodness. You need to tag me in.
[19088.58s -> 19108.34s]  Why won't he tag? Just tag my ass in please. Tag. What do I have to do to get you to tag me in?
[19108.34s -> 19110.90s]  If you get pinned I swear to god I'm gonna beat the shit out of you in the parking lot.
[19113.22s -> 19154.95s]  Oh no. I'll do it myself. Doctor you just blew it. So bad. Get it.
[19157.72s -> 19179.62s]  Don't fucking do that shit again. Give our belt back. Oh don't forget this guy. The sister
[19179.62s -> 19209.14s]  watches the game. Why did he do that? I hope the ref is okay. I did not do that let's be honest.
[19209.70s -> 19215.94s]  Litter says there was upset that he was barely involved in that match.
[19216.82s -> 19227.32s]  Errol Hathaway severely injured his shoulder in that match and would be unable to wrestle
[19227.32s -> 19251.48s]  for the next two weeks. He may be a shadow of his former self. I'm not the guy that threw
[19251.48s -> 19259.66s]  a barbell at his head. I picked him up and I gently placed him over the ropes onto the ground below.
[19260.30s -> 19265.86s]  I didn't throw a bunch of shit at him. I didn't throw a heavy dangerous barbell at his head.
[19267.34s -> 19283.26s]  I did not do that. You had fun out there Cesar but you made quite a mess of the arena.
[19283.90s -> 19310.90s]  If you want to book this venue again you better pay $300. That's fine. Alright somebody's fighting.
[19310.90s -> 19349.18s]  I heard a punch. I've not had more than 10% health in like an hour and a half game time.
[19349.18s -> 19364.47s]  Oh my god a full night's sleep finally. Okay why do I have a feud?
[19366.57s -> 19368.81s]  Perfect Sean is coming down with an illness and is in poor health.
[19369.05s -> 19372.04s]  I feel like an animal stuck in a cage and I'm ready to go.
[19372.04s -> 19376.28s]  Fans insist on treating Glitter Cesar as a heel despite his attempts to play face.
[19381.58s -> 19387.50s]  8 man war versus High Note's team. 8 man war.
[19391.37s -> 19409.46s]  Alright I want some food. I want some drink. Did you get the fans on your side to be more popular?
[19414.81s -> 19422.38s]  Um I already was a face. Yeah I want to be face. Okay let's start portraying you in a positive
[19422.38s -> 19430.34s]  light. The fans will appreciate a chance to get behind you. How is High Note alive?
[19430.42s -> 19444.14s]  I don't know. Oh this okay this drops your HP. I want the pizza. I would love for somebody to
[19444.14s -> 19450.10s]  explain what happened. I tried to pick the pizza up and I fucking jumped off and hurt myself.
[19450.74s -> 19460.54s]  This is money on the ground. Ah yep I'll take 300 bucks. I did the same thing right.
[19469.42s -> 19484.33s]  Food I'm gonna just drink the stuff on the ground. I love how this costs money.
[19496.07s -> 19522.31s]  Alright I'm good. Wait okay now I'm ready. Get out of here. Why won't he shower?
[19525.29s -> 19560.46s]  Do not sleep through your match. I want. Oh my fucking idiot. Here's our team. I'm late for
[19560.46s -> 19573.40s]  school. This belt is glued to my body. I have not taken this off. Listen up everybody there's
[19573.40s -> 19580.87s]  something I need to get off my chest before we go any further. Did you just bite me? I know I've been
[19580.87s -> 19589.02s]  a jerk in recent times. I've said and done some things that I'm not proud of. But I realize we're
[19589.02s -> 19596.66s]  nothing without the support of the fans. You're the electricity that gives us life. With your help I
[19596.66s -> 19604.26s]  know I can be a better wrestler. I hope I can repay you by fulfilling my potential. Hey we're
[19604.26s -> 19618.65s]  done with the life-changing crap. The only drama that matters is in the ring. No I don't want to
[19618.65s -> 19625.80s]  give you that. I want this money. This is my money. No I want this money. How do I put the... I want
[19625.80s -> 19634.36s]  to pocket this money. How do you pocket the money? I'm trying to pocket this money. If I can't have
[19634.36s -> 19674.63s]  it nobody can. Wait is everything legal? It is. This is gonna be a mess. Um okay. Get that high
[19674.63s -> 19709.69s]  note. It is. It's dynamite? Why is there dynamite? Why did it explode? How did it explode?
[19718.31s -> 19722.07s]  I came out with some people and I don't remember who they are so everyone's an enemy.
[19723.46s -> 19736.09s]  Oh the misery. You can set things on fire by holding taunt and then pressing the pickup key.
[19736.81s -> 19760.65s]  What? All right time for just absolutely no remorse. There's too many people in the ring we
[19760.65s -> 19765.11s]  can't... I don't think there's a pin. I think you just have to knock the people out.
[19775.88s -> 19783.24s]  Excuse me? There's a... there are pins. And how do you expect for any single person to get pinned
[19783.24s -> 19812.38s]  here? Whose belt is this guy wearing? I don't think this is possible. I might leave. There's
[19812.38s -> 19832.60s]  no rope breaks either. Who's winning? I have to shock out eliminated. I need the chair. I need
[19832.60s -> 19863.83s]  something dangerous. Get up. Pin this guy. He's a teammate? You gotta be shitting me dude. No way.
[19880.95s -> 19896.50s]  Okay I think Harley is on my team. The guy brought money into the ring.
[19897.14s -> 19923.94s]  Yeah she is. I might just walk out of the arena. I don't think this is a title match. I'm just
[19923.94s -> 19964.34s]  going to be artillery. All right pin pin pin somebody. Am I pinning someone? Burn items by
[19964.34s -> 19982.50s]  holding taunt then pressing the pickup button. This guy off me. Save the ref. There is no ref.
[19982.50s -> 20001.88s]  Okay taunt. Pick up. Hold taunt. Pick up item. I don't think that did anything. Is that my guy?
[20001.88s -> 20035.11s]  All right break his ankle. Good. Oh judgment Dave eliminated. Excuse me don't pin me. You
[20035.11s -> 20047.11s]  gotta be shitting me. We're gonna lose. This is just absolute mayhem. Like I don't even know
[20047.11s -> 20076.94s]  what's going on. If falls count anywhere I need to bring somebody outside. That's gonna be it.
[20077.91s -> 20098.94s]  Thank god. All right I think it's even now. It only works if it's flammable. Can we get this
[20098.94s -> 20124.95s]  guy out? Because that's he's. That was 2v1. Good. Really could have lost that one. Yeah um get out
[20124.95s -> 20138.57s]  please. These guys shouldn't be in it. They're both still in here. This is horseshit. All right well
[20138.57s -> 20158.10s]  now the last one here. Let's make sure that he doesn't. Please. That's it. Apparently it's not.
[20158.74s -> 20171.90s]  Now it is. Somebody. You flipped the camera on fire. Get this. You gotta get this on camera.
[20172.98s -> 20186.06s]  Hell yeah. Too excited. Too big of a hug. Too excited. I know it can get confusing sometimes
[20186.06s -> 20223.58s]  Harley but I mean I want this. I want that 20. Okay I think we're doing fine.
[20229.58s -> 20239.19s]  Being hindered but I got more agility. That's fine. I tied as a disappointed that his client
[20239.19s -> 20264.12s]  lost that match. All right good match. I want to challenge the person for the world championship.
[20264.12s -> 20270.09s]  I don't know who it is. May have been an accident but Errol halfway got hurt because of you.
[20273.18s -> 20277.26s]  Before this situation caused any more pain you better pay him 900 dollars in compensation.
[20277.82s -> 20286.41s]  Get the fuck out of here. What are you talking about? What the fuck are you saying?
[20287.43s -> 20291.35s]  I didn't fucking do anything. That's not my problem. I didn't fucking do anything.
[20291.35s -> 20296.79s]  I didn't mean to put all the blame on you. I suppose Errol needs to take responsibility.
[20296.79s -> 20328.20s]  I didn't fucking do anything. We won that match thanks to me. Never forget that. True. You don't
[20328.20s -> 20343.85s]  look so good. You all right? This guy's got zero HP. Bro there ain't nothing in here. Give me that
[20343.85s -> 20367.50s]  back. No take backs. Are you serious? No. Get out of here. Get... Excuse me. I want that. Did I get
[20367.50s -> 20378.30s]  it? Give me that. Holy shit that was a nightmare. Oh my god. Wait a minute. Give me this. He's
[20378.30s -> 20397.86s]  sleeping. This guy always has a sledgehammer. You know what? Nobody's gonna have it. Give me back
[20397.86s -> 20402.42s]  that hammer. I'll show you what it is. All right. I need it for one second. I'll give it right back.
[20403.56s -> 20419.35s]  I promise I'll give it right back. That's fine. I'll give it right back. Oh I was gonna hit this
[20419.35s -> 20435.24s]  guy in the face with it but now it's just down. That's whatever. That's what a champion does.
[20436.65s -> 20456.92s]  Celebration. Why is there another hammer? What's the match?
[20462.50s -> 20481.42s]  Confrontation versus Jester at 8 p.m. You got it. Did I lose the hammers? I didn't. I didn't do it.
[20481.42s -> 20494.26s]  I just literally pressed left on the analog. What is wrong with this guy? Oh thank god. My
[20494.26s -> 20515.03s]  hammers are still there. Oh fuck. I've been playing way too much Elden Ring. I just tried to press
[20515.03s -> 20526.34s]  Y and R1 to put this in two hands. Can I take two hammers? I don't think so. Can you? Wait maybe I
[20526.34s -> 20568.62s]  can. Oh my goodness. Are you kidding me? Who was the pain in the ass? I can't double hammer. I'm
[20568.62s -> 20599.88s]  sorry. Okay. Um okay. Well I'm gonna. No pick up the hammer. All right. Glitter Cesar. What do you
[20599.88s -> 20622.73s]  want? Doink. What's this about? Hey Glitter Cesar. When you mess with my friends and you answer to me.
[20627.40s -> 20634.63s]  I know it happens to be a friend of mine and I don't appreciate what you did to him.
[20634.63s -> 20639.86s]  I not got what he was coming to him man. Don't worry. I got plenty left for you you fucking idiot.
[20639.86s -> 20688.60s]  Okay kid. Don't let him take the belt. That's disrespect. Where did the hammer go? Oh nobody
[20688.60s -> 20699.67s]  touches my fucking hammers. Oh my god. He got it. Nobody touches my fucking hammers. Threw it into
[20699.67s -> 20734.17s]  the crowd. Holy shit. He's still standing. I okay. I kind of want this guy on my team. This is face
[20734.17s -> 20747.05s]  behavior. The game wants me to take his health to zero. I'm just doing it in a very efficient way.
[20747.05s -> 20791.93s]  I'm the game is like hey take this guy's health to zero. Where is he? He's hiding in the crowd.
[20791.93s -> 20800.92s]  Oh man. He's you want to go? Fine. Hammer v hammer in the ring right now. You want to do it? That's
[20800.92s -> 20840.09s]  fine. Sure. A nice big hug. Um I want my hammers back. Those are valuable. What's the other one?
[20840.09s -> 20884.90s]  Okay there's one and there's two. All right I'm good. He came out and yelled at me and he said he
[20884.90s -> 20905.06s]  was gonna kill me. Oh we're almost there. Almost number one. How many runes did you get? All right
[20905.06s -> 20912.81s]  I want a championship. We've had we've had tag championships for like two hours. I want the real
[20912.81s -> 20927.80s]  prize. Holy shit. All right Lance Monaco you own this league but I honestly didn't do it. I just
[20931.78s -> 20935.38s]  oh I don't. If I pick up that other hammer I swear to god it's over for everybody.
[20936.18s -> 20947.03s]  I had my hammers in my hand too. Okay where's the other one? I'm not fucking around anymore.
[20947.03s -> 20960.50s]  Who did that? You know I've deserved it. I deserved it. That's retaliation for all the dumb
[20960.50s -> 20970.17s]  shit I've been doing. So I get it. Anyway that doesn't mean I'm gonna let that fly though.
[20970.81s -> 20994.30s]  You know what I'm saying? Oh shit I think my neck hurts. There's too many bodies in the way. I need
[20998.14s -> 21006.09s]  all right I'm out. I'm out. I'm done. This guy in the red shirt. I don't know. I don't know what
[21006.09s -> 21019.53s]  you're doing. That's your boss. He jumped on me and started hitting me in the head with a wrench.
[21021.56s -> 21035.05s]  Hey you got a title. Can we talk? I want to challenge the championship. Give me a title shot.
[21035.05s -> 21059.18s]  Title shot. Come here. Get away from me. Oh my god. Thanks for this hammer. I know what I'm
[21059.18s -> 21078.65s]  gonna do with it. No that's not yours. Wait can I have a title match? Hey look Errol has recovered
[21078.65s -> 21087.24s]  from his injury and looks forward to getting back to work. Have you ever heard of a wrestler
[21087.24s -> 21096.22s]  called Tate Madison from Weekend Warriors? I think we could do the gimmick better so how would you
[21096.22s -> 21110.89s]  like to be our version of him? What happened? Did I change my hair again? Why do I look fatter
[21110.89s -> 21121.69s]  than ever? I'm not imitating anybody. I should have signed the real Tate Madison instead of you.
[21122.25s -> 21140.74s]  Here's a champ. Perfect Sean. What do you want Glitter, Cesar? This better be worth my time.
[21141.38s -> 21152.20s]  I challenge you to a match. I'm busy on the fourth week of September. Let's talk about this some
[21152.20s -> 21172.10s]  other time. What about you? I challenge you to a match. There wouldn't be any chemistry between us
[21172.10s -> 21177.83s]  so long as we're both faces. That's not what I asked. I said I want to fight you for your belt.
[21178.39s -> 21190.44s]  Heavyweight Championship. I got no show. That means I can do whatever I want.
[21196.74s -> 21230.97s]  Anything else to talk about? Alright time to take a shower. Okay there we go. Much better.
[21230.97s -> 21257.75s]  The real weird way to take a shower. Would you be willing to sell that table leg for $10? Sure.
[21257.75s -> 21294.86s]  Unless you're doing business with you. Serious? Get out of here! Fine you can have it. Take it.
[21294.86s -> 21351.35s]  You can have it. I like the gun on fire. I'm just such a little shit. Oh no is he alright?
[21351.35s -> 21374.22s]  You guys been fighting in here the whole time? This is what I do on my day off
[21374.22s -> 21411.64s]  really. Bam bam. So the way that no match is going on so what's out here? What's going on outside?
[21411.64s -> 21438.26s]  Oh there really is nothing going on. Can I sleep in the ring? Go check the subway out.
[21438.26s -> 21464.14s]  That's a good idea. Um what happened? What was that? Do you want to talk? I mean I'm just I'm
[21464.14s -> 21470.84s]  there's no show or anything going on here. Not today. You know you can maintain your grip
[21470.84s -> 21482.42s]  after a move by holding attack or grapple. Actually really good tip. We should work
[21482.42s -> 21513.27s]  together. Alright I'll go to the subway. I ain't going without some type of protection.
[21513.27s -> 21540.26s]  How are you? Nothing to say? Pyroids. Where do I get them? Now you cannot get hit by the train.
[21540.26s -> 21584.42s]  Where does this go? How are you doing? This is the boss's son. Oh okay. Anybody else on the train?
[21600.15s -> 21609.54s]  I don't think there's anything else for me to do. Why is this so scary? Um it's just kind of scary
[21609.54s -> 21639.59s]  isn't it? Weird. What else is down here? There are more places to have random fights. I could go to bed.
[21639.59s -> 21661.90s]  Yeah go go to the plane. Yeah I I'm not fucking around on the plane. It really is Silent Hill.
[21670.97s -> 21690.20s]  Okay. So what's on the card now? Uh oh. Confrontation with the Aero Hathaway? This is the
[21690.92s -> 21704.86s]  the guy that I threw over the top rope and hurt. This is the ref definitely taking the hammer
[21706.94s -> 21716.15s]  without a doubt. This game is insane. Wish you luck in your match tonight. Is it a match? Why would I
[21716.15s -> 21721.86s]  fight a referee? Dangerous things happened back here and it would be a shame if you ended up
[21721.86s -> 21733.50s]  crawling to the ring. I would choose your words more carefully, God. 1200 bucks. Look at your
[21733.50s -> 21740.92s]  health. You think I'm bluffing? When I'm finished with you the only place you'd be going is intensive
[21740.92s -> 21761.19s]  care. Interesting because that's exactly what I was gonna just say to you. Whoa. It's almost time for
[21761.19s -> 21778.73s]  our match. We're gonna go hear what the referee has to say. Have you ever worked with a wrestler
[21778.73s -> 21787.18s]  called Matty McFly here at All American Wrestling? His contract is up for renewal soon so we'd be
[21787.18s -> 21797.90s]  interested to know if you have any feedback. Um, Matty McFly was all right. I liked him.
[21797.90s -> 21804.78s]  I'd be pleased to hear that. We'll do our best to keep him. Wasn't he a nice guy? I thought he was
[21804.78s -> 21820.10s]  nice to me. Was he not nice? Why is everybody following me? What are you doing? Leave me. What
[21820.10s -> 21826.62s]  the fuck are you doing? Wait, get out. Excuse me. What are you doing? Leave me alone. Dude, I don't
[21826.62s -> 21836.10s]  want to hit you with this but I'm gonna. You're telling me to calm down. You are the aggressor
[21836.10s -> 21845.90s]  right now. I am not doing anything. I'm waiting to go on stage for my match. Oh no, the tables have
[21845.90s -> 21886.81s]  turned. Everybody's. All right, almost time. When is our match gone? Ready. Where is he? Where is he?
[21886.81s -> 21896.18s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Oh, it's you. I wasn't sure if I would ever step between
[21896.18s -> 21902.92s]  these ropes again after I got injured. Thanks to the support of my fans, I'm back better than ever.
[21902.92s -> 21910.17s]  You can break my bones but you can never break my spirit. Do you think any of these people are glad
[21910.17s -> 21918.47s]  that you're back or even noticed that you were gone? Don't get too comfortable, Errol Hathaway,
[21918.47s -> 21925.40s]  because I'm going to send you right back to intensive care. I'm not a face at all. I really
[21925.40s -> 21935.43s]  don't want to do this but I think the story is okay. Well, now you put our belt on. That's like
[21935.43s -> 21941.67s]  the most that you that is absolute trash. What you've just done. There's no remorse for what I'm
[21941.67s -> 21948.02s]  what I you take the belt and put it on. My buddy Hyane is going to show you a thing or two.
[21948.74s -> 21970.41s]  What is that about? About respect, for god's sake. I don't want to hurt him again. I don't want to
[21970.41s -> 21990.71s]  hurt him again. I'm thinking about walking out. Oh, my mouth, my lip. Okay, I've had enough.
[21994.92s -> 21999.74s]  Okay, that's enough. Okay, I'm literally out of here. I don't want to do this. I don't want
[21999.74s -> 22017.62s]  to fucking kill this guy. Okay, that's enough. That's enough, right? That's enough. Okay,
[22017.62s -> 22034.09s]  that's enough. I like jumped on him. No, you guys are crazy. I don't want to do this. Listen
[22034.09s -> 22041.75s]  to you guys. Listen to you guys. I don't want to do that. I'm not going to hurt him. I'm just
[22041.75s -> 22052.31s]  going to take his health to zero. His face on like concrete. This poor guy. Oh, this is not all right.
[22052.31s -> 22057.98s]  I don't like this at all. This doesn't feel good. This feels bad. He's a referee for god's sakes.
[22058.62s -> 22089.67s]  He's a cocky referee. Okay, he's done. Do not put your foot down. Do not. Oh, my god.
[22091.50s -> 22105.16s]  Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Get me out. I thought if I held it, I could. Guys, I didn't mean to do that.
[22106.68s -> 22116.07s]  I've done so many terrible things today accidentally. Like, I didn't actually want
[22116.07s -> 22121.90s]  to do that to this guy. So many things have happened on this stream I didn't want to do.
[22122.78s -> 22127.62s]  How did you do that by accident? I was going to kick him in his leg,
[22128.18s -> 22131.86s]  but he lifted his foot up right. Oh, man. That's not good.
[22139.61s -> 22150.92s]  Caught in 4K. You're awful. No, I swear to god I'm not. I'm not. I swear. I didn't mean to do that.
[22150.92s -> 22156.04s]  I would never do it. I wanted to let him leave. I didn't want to hurt him. I don't want to hurt
[22156.04s -> 22163.26s]  anybody, okay? I don't want to hurt anybody. No one. I'm not hurting anybody. Look at this.
[22163.26s -> 22169.02s]  Look at this violence over here. Look at this violence. I didn't do this. They did. And I'm
[22169.02s -> 22181.82s]  just walking through. Look, I'm just walking through. I'm going to my hotel room and I'm going
[22181.82s -> 22198.06s]  to go to bed. What the fuck are you? What are you doing in my hotel room? We good? Are we good?
[22198.06s -> 22220.28s]  Are we good? We good? We good? Okay, sorry. You can have it back. Right. Okay. This guy's on crack.
[22220.28s -> 22243.80s]  This guy's on drugs. I came in here with that hammer. You stole it from him moments ago. I
[22243.80s -> 22256.47s]  did not. I can't believe it. Poor Errol Hathaway. I want to go apologize to him.
[22256.47s -> 22274.50s]  You can change your name in the gimmick menu. That's kind of funny though.
[22279.43s -> 22325.96s]  Strong new. We're a new man. New strong. Turning over a new leaf. Positivity. No violence. No
[22325.96s -> 22332.28s]  kicking anybody. No hitting somebody in the head with a hammer. None of that. I'm going to help
[22332.28s -> 22382.31s]  people. I want a good song. One that's like uplifting. Here we go. Nope. Alright. Nothing
[22382.31s -> 22391.05s]  bad. I'm going to be kind to everyone I come across. I promise. Howdy, big fly. I put a
[22391.05s -> 22398.26s]  good word in for you. See? Good start. Something you want to say? Yeah. I put a good word in for
[22398.26s -> 22414.97s]  you. I have a proposal for you. I'd like to work with you. I already have a tag team partner,
[22414.97s -> 22433.86s]  but I've challenged you to do a friendly match. No. No, I can't. I got it out of my system. I'm
[22433.86s -> 22450.63s]  fine. We are defending the championships today. Can I just shake people's hands? I'm not going to
[22450.63s -> 22456.17s]  pick up any weapons. I hear you changed your entrance theme, strong new. It sounds terrible.
[22456.17s -> 22464.20s]  Well, I mean, that's, we have, we have different opinions. We might have two completely distinct
[22464.20s -> 22470.04s]  thoughts, but that does not mean that my opinion is invalid and yours is invalid. We both feel
[22470.04s -> 22475.22s]  different things. You know, we come from different places. We may have different tastes and I respect
[22475.22s -> 22482.55s]  that for you. I respect that. Have a great day. Have a great day. I'm keeping an eye on your
[22482.55s -> 22490.76s]  progress. I think some changes need to be made. Nine matches without losing is quite a streak,
[22490.76s -> 22499.30s]  but you're making everybody else look bad. Put someone over by the fourth week of October to
[22499.30s -> 22510.62s]  prove that you care about this business. Okay. You know, I want to make sure that the fellow wrestlers
[22511.42s -> 22514.78s]  all have a good chance and everybody thinks that they're doing a very good job.
[22515.26s -> 22521.66s]  But someone over exactly. Yeah. I'm going to make sure that I lose a match because we want to make
[22521.66s -> 22532.65s]  sure everyone feels pretty good about it. Right. Of course. I want to support everybody. Of course.
[22532.65s -> 22540.71s]  Oh, wow. That hurt. I deserved it though. Oh, my shin that hurt. I must've said something like
[22540.71s -> 22557.00s]  annoying. Everybody's getting fucking beat up on your own business. You want to take a fall?
[22557.64s -> 22562.92s]  Where is he? Oh, I must've said something that you didn't like. Oh, you want to take a fall
[22562.92s -> 22571.91s]  Lance? You want me to take a fall? Is that what it is? That's F for a fall. I'm more popular than
[22571.91s -> 22576.71s]  you strong new. Don't start something you can't finish. Oh yeah. Well, that must've said something
[22576.71s -> 22610.86s]  that annoyed you, right? Yeah. Oh shit. I'm knocked out. I think I'm knocked out. I can't walk. No,
[22610.86s -> 22655.45s]  wrong way. Classic glitter shitter. No, I'm going to be a good person. You're a long way from home
[22655.45s -> 22662.52s]  Congo. You should have stayed at maple leaf grappling. I've gotten fatter. You may have a
[22662.52s -> 22666.28s]  big fish in that small pond, but all American wrestling is tough for a loser like you. I'm
[22666.28s -> 22672.33s]  not saying this. This is my yard and these are my fans. Nobody carves out a successful career here
[22672.33s -> 22678.01s]  without my blessing. I don't even have a championship. That's strange because I recall.
[22681.75s -> 22686.15s]  Oh shit. Sorry. Sorry. My face.
[22686.15s -> 22722.47s]  I didn't know that was, I didn't know that was the title of that. Oh, everybody hates us now.
[22736.25s -> 22743.93s]  I don't know. I like the new era of, I'm trying to be like a nice person. Now I'm getting the
[22743.93s -> 22750.41s]  championship and I'm going to be a nice person. I'm not going to talk shit. I'm not going to say
[22750.41s -> 22754.86s]  anything that's going to make somebody want to punch me in the face. Like I've, I've walked up
[22754.86s -> 22758.46s]  to people and said like, oh, hey, you're a fucking loser. And then they punched me in the face,
[22758.46s -> 22763.90s]  right? I've hit people and they hit me back. That era is over. I'm not going to be an idiot. I'm
[22763.90s -> 22773.51s]  not going to be stupid. I'm going, I'm actually going to try. Go talk to the boss. That's right.
[22773.51s -> 22790.33s]  I was supposed to do that with the boss. I was supposed to do that. I was supposed to throw.
[22790.97s -> 22816.62s]  Why can I not go in there? Wait for the mission to end. Probably the next day it was on the floor.
[22816.62s -> 22840.23s]  I think that's a Maddy McFly. Oh, maybe bailing doesn't count as a dive. Really? I feel like it
[22840.23s -> 22859.94s]  should. I might be in the office. I've been challenged to put someone over. Oh my God. I
[22859.94s -> 22878.95s]  didn't. Shit. It didn't count. No, it didn't count. All right. Wait, maybe it did. Oh, it did. Okay.
[22879.51s -> 22885.82s]  You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever. A thousand dollar bonus. That's
[22885.82s -> 22894.95s]  not worth the titles. Sorry. Hey, do you know who stole my clothes? I can't go out there looking
[22894.95s -> 22907.32s]  like this. Would you be willing to sell me your gear if I paid you $790? That's funny you say
[22907.32s -> 22921.34s]  that. Sure. If you're $790, I will give you the pair of underwear that I shit in. You just saved
[22921.34s -> 22936.09s]  my life. Hope I can do the same for you sometime. What a deal. This is a steel cage match. Strong
[22936.09s -> 22945.13s]  new. How would you like to take me on in a match on the second week of October? I think I'm already
[22945.13s -> 22950.81s]  booked. I think I'm already booked. It's a shame. I hope we get a chance to work together somewhere
[22950.81s -> 22979.93s]  down. I have a match like tomorrow. Don't I? I didn't press anything. It landed on my head.
[22986.58s -> 22990.66s]  Good morning. Good morning. Good morning to you all. Good morning. Good morning.
[22992.33s -> 23001.74s]  I'm gonna take a fall. It's such a wonderful world we live in in this nice street. What did
[23001.74s -> 23013.53s]  the person say? Good morning. You're booked in a steel cage tag team match. Do you need to explain
[23013.53s -> 23045.90s]  the rules? No, I don't. But I would absolutely love to clean here. Nice Monty Python. I think I'm fine
[23045.90s -> 23056.54s]  on health. The amount of people that said stop. You know what my favorite thing is? I don't know. I
[23056.54s -> 23061.67s]  think it's so fun just to have... What am I doing? I'm just kind of waiting for the... I will have the
[23061.67s -> 23073.78s]  urge to hit somebody with this brump. I'm just wandering around until the match. If I stand still
[23073.78s -> 23082.04s]  for more than an hour, I'm going to hit somebody with this. Do you think it's fun to be annoying?
[23086.57s -> 23101.46s]  No, I wouldn't say annoying. It's fun to be really annoying. I don't want to hit this guy,
[23101.46s -> 23119.32s]  but I'm gonna... Leave me alone. I'm just kidding around, man. Why is a ref climbing this?
[23132.63s -> 23140.70s]  If he falls, it doesn't count that I didn't hurt him. I remember what it's like to be the tag team
[23140.70s -> 23152.17s]  champion. Yeah, because we just were. I also felt something wasn't right. Wait, is this for the
[23152.17s -> 23169.38s]  championship? He needs to be in here, doesn't he? You're a loser. Doesn't the referee need to be in
[23169.38s -> 23181.10s]  here? I can't... I don't think I can use the broom. I want to shake it so the referee falls.
[23181.82s -> 23200.01s]  The whole goal is to climb out of the ring, right? I think this guy tapped out. This guy's tapped
[23200.01s -> 23216.44s]  out like three times. Okay, who is actually... You climb out of the ring, right? What is going on?
[23221.72s -> 23240.14s]  Don't you climb out? I thought it was you have to escape. Oh, it's just we're in the... It's just a
[23240.14s -> 23268.65s]  pin. Okay. I'm sorry. I just thought of the good morning song. I deserve to get called out for
[23268.65s -> 23301.38s]  that one. It was awful. Please don't kill me. All right, the teammate disappeared. Is this to get
[23301.38s -> 23309.90s]  the belt back? How do I actually get the... The tag team championship is fine, but I want to do
[23309.90s -> 23321.03s]  the belt. I want the world championship. It's not in, right? The theater kid singing voice.
[23325.51s -> 23330.23s]  I hope you guys understand that I'm just fucking around 95% of the time, right?
[23340.62s -> 23349.42s]  I'm just fucking around. I'm just messing around. You are a theater kid. I'm a theater adult,
[23349.98s -> 23375.64s]  which is way worse. He's won the tag team back. Best part is the referee has to do this too.
[23382.71s -> 23419.40s]  Dude, I'm never getting out of here, I don't think. Get me out of here. All right, so we won the tag
[23419.40s -> 23450.57s]  team again. Only soulless zoomers hate new metal wrestling. Congratulations on winning the tag
[23450.57s -> 23459.91s]  team. The gold is where it belongs now. Oh, thanks Harley. I appreciate it. That was cool. All right.
[23459.91s -> 23466.73s]  Can we make a... I'm curious what's going on. You're still here, but what's going on out here now?
[23466.73s -> 23505.91s]  There's a fight going on. Everybody stop. What? Is it weird that I came in here? Okay. All right.
[23505.91s -> 23533.66s]  All right. I'm leaving. I'm going to leave. All right. I'm leaving. It's just chaos. Just no,
[23533.66s -> 23542.33s]  I don't have nobody I'm attacking. I'm just, I'm just K. I don't want to say that word. I'm chaos
[23542.33s -> 23563.77s]  because it's like, come on, dude, relax. I am chaos. Oh, my knee kind of ruined everything.
[23566.23s -> 23575.58s]  All right. That's, I'm probably going to call it here. Maybe like one more match. That's the guy.
[23575.58s -> 23598.87s]  That's the guy I gave my underwear to by the way. Oh my God. That's so stupid. Don't hit the guy
[23598.87s -> 23609.45s]  with the underwear. Let me challenge another person. It's in the menu. I want to try. I go for a belt.
[23609.45s -> 23630.71s]  If I can't get the belt, then obviously I'll call it. Keep streaming idiot. Oh, no. This game is so
[23630.71s -> 23645.66s]  goddamn funny. It really is just so fun. Oh, your buddy major Merc suggested that you might like to
[23645.66s -> 23652.55s]  join us at wrestling revolution. Okay. We feel he'd be a valuable addition to the roster and we're
[23652.55s -> 23658.36s]  prepared to make it happen with this deal. Hey Elden Ring, you're going to lose a fan forever.
[23659.00s -> 23667.02s]  Yeah. I played Elden Ring like a month straight. That's a lot of money.
[23668.22s -> 23685.19s]  We'll pair you with major Merc straight away to help you get you over a strong one. What do you
[23685.19s -> 23705.54s]  think of the new hairstyle? Our style is suggested for you. I think it's fine. Let me go for a title
[23705.54s -> 23719.53s]  match immediately. Who has like the world championship here? All right. This is a strong
[23719.61s -> 23730.44s]  new. What do you want to talk about? I want that title. Everybody wants a shot at my intertitle.
[23731.00s -> 23738.62s]  I'll get to the back. Okay. Well, is this just a one-off? Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll play it
[23738.62s -> 23751.37s]  again another time. I kind of want to see something really quick though. Did this change at all?
[23753.50s -> 23775.37s]  You could do some really, really wacky stuff here. Individuals, hardcore, the bathroom,
[23775.37s -> 23779.86s]  the barbershop, the bar, the subway. How do you eliminate people in a subway?
[23780.50s -> 23803.54s]  Plane. The tables again. Gauntlet escape to victory. What's escape? Okay. Rotation, singles,
[23805.99s -> 23822.22s]  singles, hardcore, no falls, no stopping, no countouts. Um, I think this is fine.
[23822.78s -> 23827.93s]  How did we put tables in here before?
[23827.93s -> 23857.35s]  What's my standing sumo contest? They're, uh, Reno.
[23866.39s -> 23883.03s]  Maybe not. Oh, here we go. It's probably going to crash the game. It did last time.
[23892.41s -> 23902.84s]  Uh, let's see what happens. Okay. That sounds good.
[23931.93s -> 23942.79s]  We can use it for just a second. All right. We're going to just
[23943.35s -> 23957.50s]  backflip off of this and do a bunch of tables. Oh God. How do we, how did I climb these before?
[23958.30s -> 23975.13s]  Remember I climbed all the way up. Jesus. I can't have the broom. Okay. Here we go.
[23980.84s -> 23999.64s]  Get out of here. Come on, climate, please. Whatever. It was a Monty Python joke.
[24003.27s -> 24014.20s]  I was standing on top of them before. Did they patch out tower climbing? Probably not. I'm
[24014.20s -> 24024.46s]  probably just not doing it right. Get off. How long are you going to, he just broke my arm.
[24025.26s -> 24044.23s]  What are this guy's stats? All right. I'll see you guys later. Next stream is going to be on, uh,
[24044.23s -> 24059.46s]  Saturday. Do some MS DOS. Have like 20 games we can play. Maybe even more, but it's going to be
[24059.46s -> 24068.66s]  hard to go through them all. Conquer construction, please. That's one of them. All right. I got to
[24068.66s -> 24075.69s]  get out of this. Thanks for watching as usual. That was a lot of fun. This game kind of just
[24075.69s -> 24082.68s]  drained me mentally and physically. It's just such a shit show. It's so funny. So much wild
[24082.68s -> 24089.83s]  shit just happens randomly. I mean, I'm not going to tell you, I'm never going to play this again
[24089.83s -> 24098.17s]  because obviously it seems like, uh, M Dickie is updating this all the time. So that was a lot of
[24098.17s -> 24110.33s]  fun. I'll see you guys on Saturday. Thanks for watching. Goodbye. Good night. Let me turn this
[24110.33s -> 24129.85s]  off. Here comes the glove eating stream. It's not April 24th yet. I've got at least a week. What's
[24129.85s -> 24137.85s]  time on Saturday? Probably around four. Same time as this one. I don't know what I'm going to start
[24137.85s -> 24160.90s]  with. Somebody said you kick ass so hard. I thought you said you suck ass so hard. Oh no.
[24160.90s -> 24177.99s]  Now that stream is a lot of fun. Start with Shito. Maybe I will. I can't believe the guy shit his
[24177.99s -> 24185.32s]  pants. We're glossing over that part of this stream. I was holding my ass with two hands,
[24185.32s -> 24190.23s]  backing up, walking around, getting chased by people and I shit my pants.
[24190.23s -> 24202.81s]  We kind of just moved on from that really quickly. All right. Goodbye. I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[24202.81s -> 24264.92s]  Take care of yourselves and good night.
