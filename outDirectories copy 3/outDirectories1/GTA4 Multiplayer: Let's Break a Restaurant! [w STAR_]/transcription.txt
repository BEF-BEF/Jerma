[1.66s -> 3.42s]  You didn't order any food.
[3.42s -> 5.50s]  Oh, I gotta order the food first. Hold-
[5.50s -> 6.70s]  Okay, ladies, hold on.
[6.70s -> 9.18s]  All right, so you want a chicken sandwich.
[9.18s -> 9.68s]  You want-
[11.80s -> 14.60s]  Okay, ma. I get it. I understand.
[16.95s -> 31.88s]  I'm really sorry. They don't have any more chicken sandwiches.
[31.88s -> 34.52s]  Sorry, mom. I know you're mad about it.
[34.52s -> 36.30s]  I'm back. I got- What did you want?
[36.94s -> 39.10s]  My mother needs a chicken sandwich.
[39.10s -> 42.62s]  Okay, let's just- I gotta back up and go get it.
[42.62s -> 44.07s]  It's in the back.
[44.39s -> 46.47s]  Hold on. It's in the back.
[47.35s -> 53.16s]  Hold on. I think I got it. I got it.
[53.16s -> 54.12s]  I got it. Coming back.
[58.26s -> 62.46s]  Here's a chicken sandwich.
[67.54s -> 70.10s]  How the fuck are you riding this motorcycle?
[70.90s -> 77.91s]  Where did- Wait, there are employees in here now.
[77.91s -> 78.95s]  There's employees in here.
[79.59s -> 80.15s]  What the fuck?
[80.15s -> 81.59s]  Where did the employees come from?
[81.59s -> 83.03s]  There's people sitting in here too.
[83.67s -> 88.25s]  There's all these dead bodies that they're just sitting on.
[89.77s -> 93.45s]  You have the door locked. They're just skiing around.
[96.82s -> 98.26s]  How do we get out of here?
[101.45s -> 102.33s]  What did we do?
[105.18s -> 106.30s]  Do you see me?
[106.30s -> 108.22s]  Yes, dude. It's on a motorcycle.
[108.22s -> 112.15s]  I'm in the ghost world. I can't see anything in here.
[113.99s -> 116.47s]  This is the most ghost world I've ever seen, Jerma.
[116.47s -> 117.75s]  All right, so you're in the ghost world.
[117.75s -> 119.91s]  You are bumping into these ladies.
[119.91s -> 121.43s]  This entire room is empty.
[122.23s -> 123.43s]  Just start throwing punches.
[127.83s -> 128.79s]  You punched a lady.
[135.14s -> 136.90s]  Guide me. I'm in the ghost world.
[143.51s -> 145.19s]  Okay. Closing all this.
[146.55s -> 148.09s]  I have no idea.
[150.02s -> 152.34s]  Dude, that was ridiculous. Just two random workers.
[152.34s -> 153.22s]  I got to get out of here.
[153.22s -> 154.42s]  I got to get out of the ghost world.
[154.42s -> 155.54s]  I can't take this anymore.
[158.92s -> 164.06s]  Oh my God. I don't want to go back to the real world.
[166.46s -> 166.96s]  Jerma.
[168.06s -> 169.98s]  I'm playing The Sims.
[169.98s -> 172.30s]  None of this is making any sense.
[172.30s -> 173.66s]  I'm playing The Sims right now.
[173.66s -> 175.50s]  This is my house in The Sims.
[175.50s -> 178.38s]  Oh, there's one of my players.
[178.94s -> 179.42s]  There he is.
[180.28s -> 183.14s]  No, Jerma. No.
[183.14s -> 184.78s]  What if I get out?
[184.78s -> 186.30s]  I'm stuck in the ghost world.
[187.74s -> 189.98s]  I think we're both stuck in the ghost world.
[189.98s -> 191.34s]  Do you see what I'm seeing?
[191.34s -> 196.86s]  Nope. It's gone.
[196.86s -> 197.90s]  Jerma, the burger shot.
[198.70s -> 201.02s]  Currently. Okay. Here I come, captain.
[201.90s -> 209.21s]  Jerma, the burger shot.
[209.21s -> 213.27s]  Hey, Jerma.
[213.99s -> 218.12s]  It's too bad you did the pillow jump into bedfall.
[218.12s -> 220.94s]  Get up. Get up.
[220.94s -> 221.74s]  What are you, a punk?
[222.46s -> 225.10s]  You're probably going to want to stand outside the burger shot for this one.
[225.10s -> 226.06s]  And just look in.
[226.70s -> 228.30s]  I have no control of my character.
[228.86s -> 229.36s]  Again.
[232.36s -> 233.88s]  Why am I going into burger shot?
[235.16s -> 236.28s]  I'm just going to let this play out.
[237.14s -> 239.78s]  Oh, okay.
[239.78s -> 240.66s]  Let's pump the gas.
[241.85s -> 242.49s]  Where's your car?
[242.49s -> 242.97s]  All right.
[242.97s -> 243.45s]  No. Okay.
[244.09s -> 245.05s]  We're going to play house.
[245.05s -> 245.55s]  Okay.
[245.85s -> 246.49s]  We're not house.
[246.49s -> 247.45s]  We're going to play like work.
[247.45s -> 248.41s]  What about the gas?
[248.41s -> 249.21s]  No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
[249.21s -> 251.54s]  You get in a car and you pull up.
[251.54s -> 252.50s]  See this person.
[252.50s -> 253.78s]  We have to like give gas.
[255.27s -> 256.39s]  God damn it.
[256.39s -> 259.72s]  Nice driving, idiot.
[259.72s -> 260.92s]  This guy's trying to get gas.
[261.56s -> 262.44s]  Excuse me, sir.
[263.08s -> 263.40s]  Sir.
[263.40s -> 265.24s]  You're going to pull up further.
[265.24s -> 265.80s]  Pull up further.
[265.80s -> 266.78s]  Let me help you.
[266.78s -> 267.34s]  He won't.
[267.34s -> 268.78s]  I would like some gas, please.
[268.78s -> 269.28s]  No.
[269.76s -> 273.56s]  There's cop cars everywhere.
[273.56s -> 275.24s]  So you're just getting gas.
[275.24s -> 276.60s]  It's not like you're doing anything bad.
[280.00s -> 280.50s]  What?
[281.60s -> 282.10s]  What?
[282.56s -> 283.84s]  Where did that come from?
[285.72s -> 286.28s]  Why did that?
[286.28s -> 286.68s]  Hold on.
[286.68s -> 287.24s]  Get over here.
[288.17s -> 290.25s]  This person just drove off the bridge.
[293.40s -> 294.60s]  What was the point of that?
[295.48s -> 297.02s]  They're still trying to accelerate.
[297.66s -> 299.69s]  He's still in there.
[299.69s -> 301.29s]  This guy drove off the bridge.
[301.93s -> 303.77s]  He really wanted to play house with us.
[303.77s -> 304.25s]  I know.
[304.25s -> 305.37s]  He wanted to come get gas.
[307.90s -> 311.37s]  Well, that made him get out.
[311.37s -> 313.29s]  Oh, now he's coming after you.
[314.41s -> 316.01s]  He's going to kick your ass.
[316.01s -> 317.61s]  I'll lure him to the gas station.
[317.61s -> 317.93s]  All right.
[317.93s -> 318.41s]  Yeah.
[318.41s -> 319.61s]  Lure him to the gas station.
[320.33s -> 321.45s]  He's wicked fast.
[324.16s -> 324.72s]  Oh, my God.
[324.72s -> 325.22s]  He is.
[326.91s -> 329.07s]  This guy is on so many drugs right now.
[330.49s -> 330.89s]  All right.
[330.89s -> 332.25s]  So what are we going to...
[333.29s -> 334.25s]  Where is he going?
[334.25s -> 335.61s]  I think he...
[335.61s -> 336.33s]  I got my bro with me.
[336.33s -> 340.44s]  I'm pretty sure he forgets where you are.
[340.44s -> 340.94s]  This guy.
[341.48s -> 343.40s]  You leave this guy alone.
[344.04s -> 347.13s]  Dude, it bounced.
[347.13s -> 347.61s]  Hold on.
[347.61s -> 348.17s]  Come here.
[349.05s -> 355.77s]  No, shit.
[355.77s -> 356.01s]  No.
[356.01s -> 356.97s]  I didn't mean to...
[356.97s -> 357.61s]  It's cute.
[357.61s -> 358.41s]  So yeah, you're dead.
[359.13s -> 359.92s]  No, I'm fine.
[359.92s -> 360.42s]  It fell off.
[361.84s -> 362.40s]  Fuck you.
[366.28s -> 368.12s]  God, that's a huge crash.
[368.12s -> 369.08s]  You, shag.
[370.12s -> 383.18s]  So loud.
[383.90s -> 386.09s]  Fuck you.
[387.72s -> 388.68s]  Screw you, bitch.
[390.20s -> 392.62s]  It's like a crack in that window.
[397.72s -> 399.16s]  I need to help you on this one.
[399.80s -> 404.65s]  Somebody got wrecked.
[404.65s -> 405.85s]  Do you see this guy?
[424.33s -> 424.89s]  All right.
[424.89s -> 427.29s]  Let's go wreck somebody's car.
