[0.31s -> 18.76s]  Like, seriously. My guy right now looks like a rubber mask. He looks like he's wearing a Halloween mask.
[18.76s -> 24.44s]  Who's that guy? It's a big fat guy.
[26.13s -> 32.26s]  What? I d- I d-
[32.26s -> 37.56s]  Well, no, no, no, I just- I dropped in the water. You're telling me that, like, I- what am I, made out of cinder blocks?
[37.56s -> 39.56s]  And I just sank to the bottom of the ocean?
[39.56s -> 42.82s]  That wasn't that far of a jump.
[42.82s -> 46.13s]  I feel like I've jumped in water way higher than that, and it was totally fine.
[46.13s -> 48.13s]  Are you- are you shitting me right now?
[48.13s -> 53.88s]  No, no, no, you just sank to the bottom. Your character weighs 15,000 pounds.
[53.88s -> 57.66s]  What the fuck is wrong with me?
[57.66s -> 61.98s]  Alright, now I- now I'm like a shredder.
[61.98s -> 63.98s]  I just turned into a shredder from Ninja Turtles.
[63.98s -> 65.98s]  This is the awesome best game I've ever made.
[65.98s -> 70.89s]  Praise the sun, by the way. Are you ready?
[70.89s -> 72.89s]  Apparently- I guess something's happening up here.
[72.89s -> 80.14s]  Bright spot ahead. Look out. Be wary of gorgeous view.
[80.14s -> 82.38s]  Okay, alright.
[82.38s -> 85.33s]  Light ahead.
[85.33s -> 88.33s]  Hurrah for gorgeous view, but be wary of hope.
[88.33s -> 93.38s]  Are these fortune cookies?
[93.38s -> 96.38s]  I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing, and I'm gonna get the kill.
[96.38s -> 99.46s]  Okay, one of your cronies is behind me now.
[99.46s -> 101.89s]  This is not good.
[101.89s -> 104.70s]  Now I got two of you assholes to deal with.
[104.70s -> 108.80s]  You're gonna fuck this up for me.
[108.80s -> 112.45s]  Holy hell.
[115.42s -> 117.42s]  This is taking- it's taking so long.
[117.42s -> 120.17s]  Welcome to Dark Souls 2.
[120.17s -> 122.47s]  The hardest game ever.
[122.47s -> 125.48s]  Bang. See you later.
[125.48s -> 127.48s]  See you later. Where's my money?
[127.48s -> 130.23s]  Where's my cash?
[130.23s -> 132.23s]  Night sword. I got a night sword.
[132.23s -> 137.22s]  I did it.
[137.22s -> 140.59s]  I completed it. I killed the boss.
[140.59s -> 142.59s]  And here's the boss song.
[145.59s -> 148.59s]  No, no, don't die. I can't die here.
[148.59s -> 151.60s]  I seriously cannot die here.
[151.60s -> 154.16s]  How do I climb down?
[154.16s -> 156.16s]  I was singing the fucking boss song.
[156.16s -> 158.53s]  Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
[158.53s -> 160.53s]  Don't freak out.
[160.53s -> 162.53s]  Okay. Chill.
[162.53s -> 164.53s]  Chill.
[164.53s -> 168.56s]  My brain.
[168.56s -> 171.76s]  This is my shield?
[171.76s -> 174.38s]  This is the shield I just put on?
[174.38s -> 176.69s]  This isn't gonna block a sword?
[176.69s -> 179.95s]  This is not gonna block a sword.
[179.95s -> 185.33s]  Are you fucking serious?
[185.33s -> 190.00s]  It's just a little baby shield.
[190.00s -> 193.78s]  Screw you.
[193.78s -> 195.78s]  My baby shield is better than your giant sword.
[195.78s -> 199.55s]  Walk onto him, you dingus.
[199.55s -> 205.82s]  Yeah.
[205.82s -> 207.82s]  You don't get a baby shield protecting your ass.
[207.82s -> 217.02s]  Baby shield.
[217.02s -> 219.02s]  What an unbelievable item.
[219.02s -> 223.17s]  Seriously.
[223.17s -> 226.37s]  You think you could fuck with the baby shield?
[226.37s -> 228.37s]  You know, I could make the joke right now.
[228.37s -> 230.37s]  I really could do it.
[230.37s -> 232.37s]  And I think I'm going to.
[232.37s -> 234.37s]  I've been saying I look like the shredder this whole time.
[234.37s -> 236.37s]  Well, this is legit a fat ninja turtle.
[236.37s -> 239.06s]  We're about to see the epic showdown
[239.06s -> 241.06s]  between huge fat Michelangelo
[241.06s -> 243.06s]  who really let himself go eating too many pizzas with pepperoni.
[243.06s -> 245.68s]  And, holy god,
[245.68s -> 247.68s]  he almost just insta-killed me.
[247.68s -> 249.68s]  Hopefully he doesn't do that.
[249.68s -> 256.59s]  Well, this is an interesting fight.
[256.59s -> 259.66s]  Kind of like who falls off first.
[259.66s -> 261.66s]  Can I push him off?
[261.66s -> 265.76s]  Are you seriously kidding me right now?
[265.76s -> 268.70s]  Let's see how you died.
[268.70s -> 271.20s]  That's a pretty big sword.
[271.20s -> 274.27s]  Of course he did.
[274.27s -> 277.73s]  Of course that's how he died.
[277.73s -> 279.73s]  I feel for these people.
[279.73s -> 282.03s]  What was that guy doing though?
[282.03s -> 286.13s]  What was that guy...
[286.13s -> 288.13s]  Is this seriously how like all people die in this game?
[288.13s -> 291.01s]  I mean, I've done it a bunch of times too.
[291.01s -> 293.01s]  I've done it a bunch of times too.
[293.01s -> 295.44s]  Like, this is how everybody dies.
[295.44s -> 297.44s]  Monsters don't kill you in Dark Souls.
[297.44s -> 300.96s]  You just walk off cliffs.
[300.96s -> 303.20s]  Got the fire arrows.
[303.20s -> 305.70s]  His like butthole face cannot scare me.
[305.70s -> 307.70s]  You think you're going to scare me with your butthole face?
[307.70s -> 312.24s]  Oh, geez.
[312.24s -> 314.24s]  What is he doing?
[314.24s -> 317.31s]  I didn't get hit.
[317.31s -> 323.39s]  How did I not get hit? What a miracle.
[323.39s -> 327.81s]  Watch out. Don't let him stop on you.
[327.81s -> 329.81s]  Good. We're in good shape.
[329.81s -> 334.08s]  Through the legs.
[334.08s -> 336.08s]  You goddamn giant.
[336.08s -> 339.79s]  Not that bad. Not that bad.
[339.79s -> 342.10s]  We're okay. We're okay.
[342.10s -> 344.10s]  Of course when he does like the stupid super jump backwards
[344.10s -> 346.10s]  that's not okay.
[346.10s -> 352.69s]  Fuck me.
[352.69s -> 354.69s]  Drink the goddamn apple juice.
[354.69s -> 356.99s]  Drink the apple juice.
[356.99s -> 361.15s]  Don't let him do it again.
[361.15s -> 364.54s]  Yeah.
[364.54s -> 366.72s]  One more hit. One more hit.
[366.72s -> 368.72s]  I am
[368.72s -> 370.72s]  the Dark Souls 2
[370.72s -> 373.28s]  master.
[373.28s -> 375.28s]  The last giant and the soldier key.
[375.28s -> 378.16s]  You can thank this grandma
[378.16s -> 380.66s]  faced fuck for saving the day.
[380.66s -> 385.25s]  Alright, this is going to say
[385.25s -> 389.58s]  uh, up?
[389.58s -> 391.58s]  Up?
[391.58s -> 393.58s]  My message to the world at this
[393.58s -> 395.89s]  boss is up?
[395.89s -> 399.47s]  He's like yeah, yeah, let's go. Come on, man.
[399.47s -> 401.65s]  This guy's name is like a swear
[401.65s -> 403.82s]  I think. Alright, well whatever.
[403.82s -> 408.22s]  Let's go. Enter the mist.
[408.22s -> 414.05s]  Alright, let's go.
[414.05s -> 416.05s]  He's coming for me. He's coming for me. He's doing his
[416.05s -> 420.14s]  thing. He missed.
[420.14s -> 423.66s]  What the hell? You throwing like spears
[423.66s -> 425.90s]  at him? This guy like killed him instantly.
[425.90s -> 429.68s]  Dude, this guy
[429.68s -> 434.86s]  he shot me
[434.86s -> 437.23s]  with those. He probably
[437.23s -> 439.23s]  thinks I'm such an idiot.
[439.23s -> 443.07s]  He
[443.07s -> 445.07s]  just like unloaded on
[445.07s -> 447.07s]  me.
