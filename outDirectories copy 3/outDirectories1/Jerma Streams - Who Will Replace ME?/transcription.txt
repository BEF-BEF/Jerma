[0.00s -> 671.84s]  Just one sec, hold on. Working on something real quick. Hello, how are you? Good to see
[671.84s -> 680.03s]  everybody again. Just got to make sure I get this settled to go here. Hi, welcome to the
[680.03s -> 684.55s]  stream everybody. I'm sure a lot of you are probably pretty curious as to the title of
[684.55s -> 691.35s]  the stream. And I've been gone for a few days, so let me sit down here. Am I in frame? Can you see me,
[691.35s -> 697.08s]  you know, everybody sit down here? So people are probably wondering what this stream is about. I've
[697.08s -> 706.46s]  been hyping it up for a couple months now. And of course, how do you describe your retirement? How
[706.46s -> 712.55s]  do you describe that? Because I've been doing this for about 10 to 12 years now. And as I've gone over
[712.55s -> 721.00s]  the last 10 years, I've never really had to think about this. And what I want to do, even if I decide
[721.00s -> 726.28s]  that I'm done, right? Like even if I'm done with Twitch, I'm done with streaming, I'm done with
[726.28s -> 734.73s]  YouTube, whatever it is. I ain't going anywhere because the brand needs to live on permanently.
[734.73s -> 739.93s]  And I tried to figure out what that meant. How do I do that? How do I, how do I let my legacy
[740.81s -> 747.45s]  continue? And oh, do you stream for like another five to 10 years? I don't fucking think so. I don't
[747.45s -> 754.22s]  think so, guys. So what I've decided to do is over the last few months, we've scoured the country
[755.18s -> 763.10s]  trying to find who I think could potentially be able to replace me. And this brand and this stream,
[763.10s -> 769.58s]  because I'm going, look, I'm going anywhere, okay? I might be stopping at some point in the future
[769.58s -> 775.51s]  here, but I ain't going anywhere. This brand is not going anywhere. I'm sticking around forever.
[775.51s -> 781.08s]  And I'm going to make sure of it today. So without further ado, what we have done is we've scoured
[781.08s -> 789.00s]  the country, various classified ads and newspapers, various boards of who would want to take the reign
[789.00s -> 794.82s]  of German at 85 because it's a very, very important reign, incredibly important reign. I've been here
[794.82s -> 804.41s]  for 12 years. It's got to go on and I need a 20% royalty, permanently. So we have scoured the
[804.41s -> 810.89s]  country. We have a group of people that I'm willing to at least assess if they can handle it or not.
[810.89s -> 814.17s]  So what we're going to do is we're going to have to go ahead and go and send in number one, please.
[815.93s -> 825.16s]  For who could be my replacement? Number one. How you doing number one? Very well. You've chosen
[825.16s -> 831.50s]  Dark Souls, I think is your game. Go ahead. Yes. Oh, all right.
[832.54s -> 838.52s]  Looks like we are playing some Dark Souls three here. That's right. Okay. Jumping around. I think
[838.52s -> 842.52s]  maybe I'm just going to roll the whole time. Oh, there's a guy right there. All right. I'm going
[842.52s -> 848.68s]  to try to roll past. Okay. Yep. I'm just going to roll here. Yep. I'm just going to keep roll. Oh,
[848.68s -> 853.40s]  there's another guy. Okay. Oh, I'm just going to roll. I'm just going to roll past here. Wait,
[853.40s -> 857.72s]  what was this thing? What did that say right there? Oh, okay. I'm just going to keep rolling.
[857.72s -> 875.80s]  I'm going to roll. I'm just going to roll. So I'm going to go around the curve here. What is up
[875.80s -> 881.00s]  here? I think aren't there supposed to be fights in this game? What is going on? I thought this
[881.00s -> 887.45s]  game was hard. Set the bonfire. Set the bonfire here. Do you know what that does? Yeah. I'm going
[887.45s -> 894.41s]  to light the bonfire, get some nice save point here. What's the bonfire do? It rests. I'm going
[894.41s -> 907.82s]  to rest here. What else does it do? It rests and it's a checkpoint. Yep. All right. He doesn't need
[907.82s -> 921.11s]  to be alive anymore here, I think. All right. Keep on going. There's a bonfire. Oh my god,
[921.11s -> 929.59s]  get out of the way. No, you guys. No, go, go, go, go, go. Okay. Okay. No, everything's fine.
[929.59s -> 935.66s]  Everything's fine. We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. Okay. We're okay. All right. What is this
[935.66s -> 940.70s]  guy? He doesn't look, this guy doesn't look very scary. No, I think I got this guy. He's like on a
[940.70s -> 946.38s]  knee. What's the big deal about that? Hey, what are you doing over here? You're just chilling.
[947.18s -> 954.22s]  It's a nice weapon. Oh, what was that? You can't shoot me from over there. That's not fair. What
[954.22s -> 957.50s]  do you think you're doing here? I would definitely do something like that. Maybe I'm going to back
[957.50s -> 962.30s]  step. Oh, nothing. You are, you are nothing. Oh, oh, here, here we go. Remove sword. All right. So
[962.30s -> 967.50s]  I'm going to remove the sword. What's the worst that could happen? Have you played Dark Souls
[967.50s -> 973.58s]  before? Great. I have played a little Dark Souls. This is what, what is, okay. All right. He's
[973.58s -> 977.66s]  moving now. That's all right. That's all right. I just, I'm going to go back to my strategy of
[977.66s -> 987.82s]  rolling here, I think maybe. And that's, well, I mean, I hear people just roll, right? You just,
[987.82s -> 993.34s]  you just roll and then you roll. Look, I'm, I'm doing, I'm doing all right. You know, I think,
[994.94s -> 998.86s]  that's all right. I got, I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.
[998.94s -> 1005.61s]  It's all right. Okay. I'm going to take a Estus Flask here. There we're all right. I think I can
[1005.61s -> 1010.01s]  take at least two more hits, right? We're all right. We're all right. Yeah. It's okay. Oh,
[1010.01s -> 1018.97s]  it's all right. That's all right. I got this. I got this. He's all right. He was supposed to
[1018.97s -> 1026.49s]  roll. He didn't roll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't, I, uh, thank you so much. So if you could
[1026.49s -> 1031.51s]  go ahead and that's, uh, I think I've seen enough. Yes. All right. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[1031.51s -> 1037.83s]  Thank you very much. Thank you. Can we send a number two, please? Hey, how are you doing?
[1037.83s -> 1044.78s]  I'm doing well. Take a seat. Yeah. All right. All right. What are we going to be playing today?
[1044.78s -> 1052.70s]  Uh, a little bit of Tetris. Oh, Tetris. Okay. Yes. All right. So I'll tab it there. Perfect.
[1053.42s -> 1056.46s]  Right there. Should do it for you. All right. Play button. I'm going to be,
[1056.46s -> 1059.58s]  I think it's the arrow keys, by the way. All right. Good. Good. Good. Number two, go ahead and
[1059.58s -> 1063.82s]  now I can start whenever you're comfortable. You got it. All right. Starting with a little,
[1064.78s -> 1070.38s]  a little squiggly shape, a little bit of the squiggle. All right. I'd like to see the squiggle.
[1070.38s -> 1075.26s]  Ooh, we got a little upside down tee. It can fit right there. All right. A little bit of
[1075.26s -> 1079.34s]  shpee. A little bit of shpee. What did you say? A little bit of, a little bit of shpee. A little
[1079.34s -> 1082.38s]  bit of shpee. You said shpee? Shpee. Oh, you said shpee. Hold on. A little bit of shpee.
[1083.34s -> 1092.68s]  All right. And a little bit of shpee. All right. Great. And another one here.
[1093.72s -> 1098.12s]  Shpee. All right. Then we got a little. Might be a little too much. Oh, a little bit,
[1098.12s -> 1101.96s]  a little bit too much. Pull back on the shpee. Pull back on the shpee. All right. You got it.
[1103.32s -> 1107.64s]  All right. You got it. All right. A little square. I'd like to see a square.
[1108.12s -> 1114.97s]  Okay. All right. I'm killing this. I, I would watch the middle there though. You gotta be careful.
[1114.97s -> 1120.97s]  I know. I know. Get built up and then you don't know what you're gonna do. All right. Good line
[1120.97s -> 1124.33s]  clear. Good line clear there. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Good line clear.
[1124.33s -> 1128.49s]  It was only one, but you know, sometimes it's all it takes. Sometimes it's all it takes. Another
[1128.49s -> 1134.25s]  line clear there. All right. So how long have you been a gamer for, number two? I've played since
[1135.21s -> 1139.05s]  1998 when I got my Nintendo 64. What was your favorite game ever made?
[1140.17s -> 1149.56s]  Favorite game ever made? Probably Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. My favorite. No?
[1150.60s -> 1154.92s]  That's a mean answer. Oh, that's a mean answer. Give me number two. Give me number two. Number two.
[1156.44s -> 1161.16s]  Oh boy. Trying to think of my number two favorite game. Second favorite game of all time. And then,
[1161.16s -> 1164.92s]  by the way, you're on the clock here. Oh, okay. On the clock. Of course. Of course. That's a mean
[1164.92s -> 1170.52s]  answer and you know it. All right. I would probably say this is going to be a little
[1170.52s -> 1177.51s]  controversial. I like Journey, underrated by that game company. That's a game where you played with
[1177.51s -> 1180.95s]  another person you didn't know who they were from across the world. Yes, exactly. Yeah.
[1181.59s -> 1188.55s]  You can work well with others. Yes. Oh, I love collab games for sure. Yes, exactly. Are you open
[1188.55s -> 1191.83s]  to collaborations with other YouTubers and streamers and stuff like that? You could get
[1191.83s -> 1196.79s]  comfortable in those spaces. Oh yeah, absolutely. I feel like I can get along with just about
[1196.79s -> 1205.14s]  anybody, really. Okay. If you clear this whole row, then I'm going to be very, very excited.
[1205.14s -> 1213.75s]  All right. Oh. We got two. We got two. I got to equip that one. Okay. Okay. You didn't get that
[1213.75s -> 1217.67s]  second row. I know. I know. I had a couple of missing blocks there. Oh, that was pretty good,
[1217.67s -> 1225.27s]  though, on the second theory. Good at deduction of mathematical intricacies. Absolutely.
[1225.99s -> 1234.95s]  The thing myself is something of a scientist. All right. Very, very nice. Very nice, number two.
[1234.95s -> 1237.99s]  Number two, very nice. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Right off the bat,
[1237.99s -> 1241.61s]  number two, very nice. Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. You know, number two,
[1241.61s -> 1243.77s]  that's all I think I need to see. That's all you need to see? That's all I need to see.
[1243.77s -> 1248.41s]  It's been an absolute pleasure. Absolutely. Yeah. All right. Phenomenal. Phenomenal job.
[1248.41s -> 1256.10s]  Appreciate it. Set it at number three, please. That was very good. Number three, how are you?
[1257.06s -> 1261.77s]  Okay. What are you going to play first? Oh, you know, like a true gamer,
[1261.77s -> 1267.29s]  you're going to flip some houses. Okay. All right. Should just be able to go like this.
[1268.01s -> 1273.74s]  All right. Right here. Controller disconnected, unfortunately. Let's see if we can get that
[1273.74s -> 1278.94s]  clicked in. Please connect the controller. It should be able to. There we go. Can you
[1278.94s -> 1287.61s]  play a continue game? Oh, you're going to have to use WASD. Oh, man. Right. Okay. Got some mouse
[1287.61s -> 1291.85s]  action here. Here we go. Let's see if number three is real. What is this garbage? Did you put this
[1291.85s -> 1296.17s]  here? No, House Clippers game where you clean. I'm not sure. Is that it? Is it just cleaning?
[1298.17s -> 1301.45s]  Yeah, I'm not going to say much. I have to stay back. I have to stay completely, completely out
[1301.45s -> 1308.70s]  of this. Oh, this is disgusting. Are there rats in this game? I bet there are. Why do you care
[1308.70s -> 1314.76s]  about that? Unless it's a large rat that makes all the rules. The fuck did he say? Nothing. Nothing.
[1314.76s -> 1319.48s]  Love it, bro. What is this? Can I take a sledgehammer to something? Doesn't like rats.
[1319.48s -> 1324.76s]  That's very important. Number three. I mean, Charlie Day and I, we go way back with rats.
[1325.40s -> 1333.08s]  What do I do with this? Set it places? Yeah. If you go to the, have you played House
[1333.08s -> 1337.16s]  Clipper before? I have never played this before. So if you go ahead and head to the laptop over in
[1337.16s -> 1343.40s]  the corner. I think there we go. There we go. There you go. Laptop will give you a job to do.
[1344.04s -> 1348.60s]  One of the jobs if you can. Sweet. Okay. Go ahead and do one of the jobs. Number three. I'm going to
[1348.60s -> 1354.20s]  just number three. You can do one of the jobs. Number three. Go to browser. I think. Fuck. Damn.
[1354.20s -> 1359.08s]  Yeah. Go to browser and then you can pick one of these. Oh, you can go to. How affordable.
[1359.08s -> 1363.24s]  Yeah. Pick one of the top left one. Number three, if you could please. All right. Can't afford
[1363.24s -> 1370.28s]  a number three. Okay. Go back. Oh, we got, can't afford any of these. Oh, is that the cheapest?
[1370.28s -> 1374.28s]  Wow. It's realistic. That's okay. That's pretty good. Go in the, maybe the mail.
[1375.16s -> 1379.24s]  All right. Okay. There you go. Yep. Okay. Except that job. Number three. Go ahead and get started.
[1379.24s -> 1383.00s]  All right. Let's see. He stole a radiator. He knows how to stall really well. That's pretty good.
[1383.80s -> 1391.16s]  He's got stalling in his record, but doesn't like rats. That's very important. Okay. Okay.
[1393.67s -> 1397.43s]  I wouldn't do that. No. I wouldn't do that. Number three. I wouldn't do that.
[1398.07s -> 1402.15s]  Hey, you around like that for no reason. That's weird. Go from Tetris.
[1403.11s -> 1407.03s]  His health just disappeared. I think you want to pivot number three. That's up to you. Go ahead.
[1407.03s -> 1409.11s]  I wouldn't let you know. I think it might've closed on itself.
[1411.35s -> 1417.43s]  You're playing Tetris. Wow. You're playing number twos. You're playing number twos. Game number
[1417.43s -> 1426.73s]  three. Number three. Can I get you to say just really quickly, can you say look at me? Look at

[1523.08s -> 1526.60s]  you. I, you know. Good take on that. You know, make some, make some money. They're probably not

[1736.58s -> 1741.38s]  where you beat the people up with the money and the cars. Grand Theft Auto. I love that game.
[1741.94s -> 1746.66s]  Which GTA? Oh, the one with the, the, the Roman numerals of, yeah, you're going to go in there.
[1746.66s -> 1750.42s]  You're going to actually, what are you supposed to do here? Press A. I'm pressing A. Which one?
[1751.38s -> 1755.62s]  I think number five, the one with the five. Yeah. Yeah. That's the one where you could fly around
[1755.62s -> 1759.38s]  and do the things where you like the cops are after you and stuff. Like you go to, oh, hey,
[1759.38s -> 1765.46s]  pull that edge. Oh, don't worry. Hi, buddy. What's up? Hey, you got my money. You got my money.

[1769.62s -> 1773.78s]  Yeah. Don't fall off that ledge. I don't know if it would be funny or not. Oh, it would definitely,
[1773.78s -> 1783.03s]  would definitely be funny. I'm not sure. Yes. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. I won, right?
[1783.03s -> 1788.39s]  Oh, number five. I think, I don't think I need to see anymore. Okay. Well, it's been great. Um,
[1788.39s -> 1793.51s]  it's been fantastic. Thank you so much. What a pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead and
[1793.51s -> 1800.87s]  send in number six, please. What a classic joke that was. Absolutely classic joke. Number
[1800.87s -> 1804.47s]  six, how are you? Good, sir. Good to see you. What are you going to be doing for us today?
[1804.47s -> 1808.47s]  Today will be dark souls. Well, good, because number five just left you out for exactly where
[1808.47s -> 1816.44s]  you need to be. Appear to be some sort of a knight. Should be an easy game. The controller
[1816.44s -> 1822.52s]  no longer functions. Number two broken. So if you use WASD on the keyboard there, you should be able
[1822.52s -> 1827.88s]  to make it. Oh, old school. Easy peasy. And the mouse too should work. Okay. I'll be careful of
[1827.88s -> 1831.72s]  that ledge. You don't want to fall off the ledge because number five, I'll be honest, number five
[1831.72s -> 1836.12s]  did the fall joke already. All right. Well, this is going to be too easy. I'm used to beating games
[1836.12s -> 1843.32s]  like broken trail. Oh shit. No, I'm fine. No, no, no, no. There you go. Actually can work under
[1843.32s -> 1850.23s]  pressure. Number six can work under pressure. I'm some sort of a paladin. This looks to be one of
[1850.31s -> 1859.91s]  my black robes friends. I don't know why the controller is vibrating. It doesn't work. It feels
[1859.91s -> 1868.78s]  good actually against my skin. Number six. There's some sort of a technical. Oh, number six. That was
[1868.78s -> 1873.48s]  actually a hilarious way to go. There was some sort of a technical glitch, I think. I don't think my
[1873.48s -> 1879.74s]  controller is working right. Your controller is broken. Is that what you say? Well, I mean, I am
[1879.74s -> 1887.56s]  a hardcore gamer. So what's your favorite game of all time? Oregon trail. Oh boy. That's bad.
[1888.28s -> 1899.93s]  Okay. Oh boy. Oh, this is easy. Click, click, click and slash. So number six, you like it when,
[1899.93s -> 1904.17s]  for instance, like people just get diarrhea through the whole game and you lose no matter what. Yeah,
[1904.17s -> 1908.49s]  I'm having some sort of a red diarrhea problem in this game. I don't know what that is, but it's
[1908.49s -> 1919.21s]  leaking out of my chest cavity. And I saw a wolf. To defeat my former friend. No one comes to the
[1919.21s -> 1930.79s]  boss door. Space is dodge by the way. Number six. Space is dodge. Oh, okay. Oh, you got a backstab.
[1930.79s -> 1935.51s]  Power punch. That was actually pretty good. Yeah, he's been working out. He's been to the gym a
[1935.51s -> 1943.53s]  couple times this week and. Number six. Destroy. Number six, I will consider this if you can get
[1943.53s -> 1952.41s]  through the boss door. A, A, A, A, A, jump. I will consider this if you get in the boss door.
[1956.01s -> 1962.09s]  What would A be? Meditate. A. A on the mouse and keyboard. Who knows? Does anybody know in chat?
[1962.09s -> 1969.67s]  Anybody know? Can anybody say it? Enter, save friend to enter. Lord of the Rings. No. Do you
[1969.67s -> 1975.14s]  like Lord of the Rings? Well, of course. Okay. Now what would you, what was the last time you
[1975.14s -> 1980.90s]  shit in your pants number six? Just about two minutes ago actually. Perfect. Right now actually.
[1982.50s -> 1987.30s]  E should be to go through the door. E. E to enter. I think you have to be standing in front of it.
[1987.30s -> 1990.98s]  So number six is shit in your pants right now. Is that what you're saying? It's a little bit
[1990.98s -> 1995.64s]  frightening here. There we go. This is easy. Number six, if you last more than 10 seconds
[1995.64s -> 2005.78s]  of this boss, I will consider it. Okay. I just. You're just supposed to click the left
[2005.78s -> 2012.28s]  button multiple times. Thank you number six. Thank you so much. That was a pleasure.
[2012.28s -> 2017.24s]  Well, we'll be in touch. Thank you so much number six. Thank you so much number six. Appreciate it.

[2646.31s -> 2653.99s]  get the sword? Right on the right arrow key. Oh. On the keyboard right arrow key. Oh, let's go, baby.
[2653.99s -> 2658.87s]  Space is dodge, by the way. Make sure that... Oh, yeah. Space is very important. This game is all
[2658.87s -> 2666.15s]  about watching these. Oh, oh, okay. Yeah. All right. Everybody picked Dark Souls. Oh, let's go,
[2666.15s -> 2672.47s]  baby. Let's go. All right. Okay. I'm feeling pretty hot. Feeling pretty sexy right now. Number 10,
[2672.47s -> 2676.87s]  if you get the first boss right now, it would be $1,000. Oh my God. Let's go. I need that rent
[2676.87s -> 2686.09s]  money, baby. Let's go. Oh, shit. Oh, yeah. Let's... Nope. Yes. Number 10, if you actually go into
[2686.09s -> 2689.61s]  this door with E and get the first boss, that would be $1,000. All right. I'm in it. I'm in it
[2689.61s -> 2692.81s]  to win it. I'm in it for the thousand. Let's go, baby. Come here. Come here. Give it to me. Nope.
[2693.77s -> 2701.45s]  Absolutely not. Let's go. Give it to me. Press E. What is drink Estus? Can we get... Can somebody
[2701.45s -> 2706.81s]  chat? Oh, I do need that Estus. Cause he's really going to... That index thunder is actually the
[2706.81s -> 2715.05s]  first boss. It's very, very scary. Oh, yeah. It's a big boy. Whoa. Give it to him. Give it to him.
[2715.05s -> 2719.53s]  Okay. All right. Just... This is a war of attrition here. Come on, Gunder. Let's go, Grandle.
[2723.27s -> 2730.14s]  Press R. It's all right. It's all right. That was very good. Number 10, can I get a look at me,
[2730.14s -> 2734.62s]  please? Yeah. Oh, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me right here. Look at me. Perfect.
[2734.62s -> 2737.42s]  Perfect. Thank you. That's all we need to see. We'll be in touch really... Thank you very much.
[2737.42s -> 2741.26s]  Appreciate it. Thank you, number 10. Really appreciate that. Send in number 11. Oh, number 11?
[2741.98s -> 2749.21s]  Number 11? Can you come in for a second here? Hey. How are you, number 11? Good. How are you?
[2749.21s -> 2752.65s]  What are you going to do for us today, number 11? I'm going to try that Dark Souls.
[2755.45s -> 2763.70s]  Unless you'd rather something else. No, please play Dark Souls. Please play it. Okay. Number 11.
[2763.70s -> 2769.30s]  I need to be very clear. Number 11. Dark Souls. Nobody's gone through the tutorial door.
[2769.94s -> 2774.02s]  Can you make it through the tutorial boss's door and beat the tutorial boss in Dark Souls 3?
[2774.02s -> 2777.14s]  You know what? I'm definitely going to try. What's your favorite pasta?
[2778.50s -> 2784.90s]  Like the noodle or all of it combined? Everything. I like rigatoni marinara,
[2784.90s -> 2788.58s]  bolognese. Rigatoni bolognese. Okay. That's a good answer. Yeah. It's my favorite.
[2789.54s -> 2792.82s]  Number 11, did you ever shit your pants? Of course. When was the last time?
[2795.70s -> 2800.25s]  Just before I got in here. Sorry. I didn't want to admit it. Very good answer, actually.
[2801.13s -> 2805.29s]  Go ahead. It's keyboard and mouse. W-A-S-D is to move. Left click is to swim your sword,
[2805.29s -> 2809.77s]  and space is to dodge. If you could take up that controller there right now, if you could.
[2809.77s -> 2811.77s]  Just control it down here? Well, the controller's broken,
[2811.77s -> 2817.53s]  but the keyboard and mouse, you do W-A-S-D to move. W-A-S-D to move?
[2817.53s -> 2819.69s]  Number two broke the controller, and we're very upset about it.
[2819.69s -> 2824.33s]  Damn it. Number two. Oh my god. Fuck me.
[2824.33s -> 2831.67s]  So if you hit W-A-S-D. I get it. I get it. Yeah, it's move.
[2831.67s -> 2835.43s]  If you hold W-A-S-D, hold W will get you to where you need to be.
[2835.43s -> 2838.55s]  Oh, great. Okay, I'm going to just go down here, I suppose.
[2839.11s -> 2842.07s]  Yeah. Oh, you didn't tell me what the attacks are.
[2842.07s -> 2846.07s]  Left click is attack, and space is dodge. Did I kill him?
[2846.07s -> 2850.07s]  You did. Fuck yeah. Okay, I guess I'm going this way.
[2850.07s -> 2852.79s]  Number 11, say shpee for me, please. Shpee.
[2854.07s -> 2855.43s]  Again? Shpee.
[2856.63s -> 2864.38s]  What is happening? You guys want to kill?
[2864.38s -> 2867.98s]  That's good. Wow, maybe I will get through that door.
[2867.98s -> 2872.94s]  That's the door right there. When you get up to that door, you press E, you'll fight the boss.
[2872.94s -> 2875.98s]  R is drink potion to heal. Very important.
[2875.98s -> 2879.18s]  R is drink potion to heal? Oh, shit.
[2882.79s -> 2886.23s]  Make sure you get rid of that guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just got to face him,
[2886.23s -> 2889.21s]  you know? Careful, careful. You got it.
[2889.21s -> 2891.85s]  You got it, you got it. You said R?
[2891.85s -> 2894.57s]  I'm healed. Where's my health? Oh, right there.
[2894.57s -> 2895.53s]  Cool. Top left corner.
[2895.93s -> 2899.77s]  You ever play Dark Souls before, number 11? No, but I used to play Crash Bandicoot,
[2899.77s -> 2902.97s]  and we would call that Dark Souls because that game is hard as hell too.
[2905.53s -> 2907.93s]  Good answer. You ever play Crash Bandicoot?
[2907.93s -> 2909.45s]  I have. That game is ridiculous.
[2910.49s -> 2920.12s]  All right, here's this bastard. Yeah, I'd definitely say so.
[2921.00s -> 2930.39s]  Number 11, thank you so much for your time. Yeah, thank you.
[2930.39s -> 2933.67s]  We appreciate it. Thank you so much. You can send it in the next one when you get out there.
[2933.67s -> 2936.55s]  Absolutely. Thank you so much, number 11.
[2936.55s -> 2938.87s]  Big Crash Bandicoot fan. Big Crash Bandicoot fan.
[2938.87s -> 2942.23s]  Love it. Hi.
[2942.23s -> 2943.83s]  Well, how are you? Good.
[2943.83s -> 2944.55s]  How are you? Good to see you.
[2944.55s -> 2948.63s]  Do you have ready to give us a little bit of a show here? I don't know if you want to play?
[2949.75s -> 2951.59s]  What can I play? You got it.
[2952.79s -> 2954.79s]  Do you want to play Dark Souls? No.
[2955.75s -> 2958.15s]  Okay. We've got Tetris. That sounds scary.
[2958.15s -> 2961.11s]  We've got Tetris, and we have also House Flipper.
[2962.07s -> 2965.67s]  Well, I will try Tetris. Tetris, all right.
[2965.67s -> 2967.83s]  We've got a Tetris player here. What is Tetris?
[2969.75s -> 2972.39s]  You're asking what Tetris is. Yeah.
[2973.19s -> 2977.19s]  I don't know what any of these games are, but Tetris sounded cool.
[2978.55s -> 2980.15s]  You don't even know what Tetris is?
[2981.96s -> 2983.72s]  Thanks a lot for coming, number 12. I appreciate it.
[2983.80s -> 2987.40s]  See, we'll be in touch. We'll be in touch. Thank you so much for your time.
[2987.40s -> 2989.08s]  You sure? Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[2989.08s -> 2992.04s]  You don't even know. You don't even go home. You don't know what Tetris is.
[2992.04s -> 2993.72s]  No. Do you know who Super Mario is?
[2993.72s -> 2996.78s]  Yes. Have a nice night.
[2996.78s -> 2999.82s]  Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Number 12, that was really fantastic.
[2999.82s -> 3001.26s]  Thank you so much. Thank you.
[3001.26s -> 3002.94s]  Number 13 can come on in, please.
[3003.90s -> 3007.02s]  How do you know what Tetris is? Number 13, how are you?
[3007.02s -> 3008.54s]  Good, good, good. Thank you.
[3008.54s -> 3010.06s]  Good to see you. What are you going to do for us?
[3010.06s -> 3014.14s]  Good to be here. Well, I am going to do Tetris.
[3014.94s -> 3016.70s]  Do you know what it is? I do.
[3016.70s -> 3019.34s]  Okay, great. You press the okay button here.
[3019.34s -> 3021.18s]  You can put in whatever initials you want. It doesn't really matter.
[3022.47s -> 3025.27s]  It's just like a random website. That's fine.
[3025.99s -> 3027.83s]  I just hit the restart button right in the middle there.
[3028.55s -> 3031.51s]  So you got the arrow keys, it should be, to move the Tetris pieces around.
[3032.55s -> 3035.03s]  And then flip them around and down is to make it go down.
[3035.03s -> 3037.99s]  And number 13, I'd like to go right up to that.
[3037.99s -> 3039.19s]  What's your favorite sound is?
[3043.08s -> 3044.52s]  How do you flip it again?
[3044.52s -> 3046.60s]  It should be the right and left arrow keys.
[3046.60s -> 3048.28s]  The right and space. Space.
[3048.28s -> 3052.60s]  Oh, okay. That one's garbage, but the next one will be better.
[3052.60s -> 3058.36s]  All right. Let's see if I can hit this down and then slide it across right now.
[3058.36s -> 3062.68s]  Yeah, that's the ticket. We're hit to be square here.
[3063.96s -> 3071.48s]  So Tetris is really fun because it was invented in the 1600s in Russia
[3072.12s -> 3075.72s]  and people would play with nothing but sticks and vodka.
[3077.43s -> 3079.43s]  And here we are all these years later playing.
[3082.49s -> 3085.93s]  Interesting story. Is that the way?
[3085.93s -> 3088.81s]  That's history. That's history.
[3088.81s -> 3095.21s]  Yeah. Vladimir Tetrisnov invented it and they used to play with rocks and sticks
[3095.21s -> 3096.73s]  and they would try to fit it.
[3096.73s -> 3099.77s]  And apparently they would build whole villages this way.
[3100.73s -> 3104.89s]  And that's why Russia is such a messed up place now.
[3106.01s -> 3110.04s]  Number 13, can I get a hug of England?
[3110.04s -> 3115.24s]  There's other reasons too. Economics, pop, but mostly I blame Tetris.
[3115.24s -> 3119.48s]  So Tetris was invented, I did not know that. That's a lore conversation.
[3119.48s -> 3125.16s]  Oh, you remember the theme song, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[3125.16s -> 3127.56s]  You know, you know that's vodka right there.
[3127.56s -> 3129.64s]  You gonna get a good clear here in number 13?
[3129.64s -> 3130.44s]  A good clear?
[3130.60s -> 3132.12s]  I gotta get a clear? Boy, clear.
[3133.98s -> 3138.38s]  Well, I think you're asking a lot for the first time, but I'll try to impress you.
[3139.34s -> 3140.94s]  Oh, it was one line though.
[3143.50s -> 3146.54s]  Well, we all gotta start somewhere. All gotta start somewhere.
[3148.38s -> 3153.18s]  Oh, you got actually. All right. Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo. Very nice number 13.
[3153.18s -> 3158.14s]  I spent a lot of summers playing on my Game Boy. I didn't have a lot of friends.
[3158.70s -> 3161.10s]  Now I have two friends, but back then I didn't have any.
[3166.36s -> 3167.72s]  You always got to one up me, huh?
[3168.68s -> 3173.21s]  You're trying to be me. Don't forget that. Can I get a look at me, please?
[3181.82s -> 3186.89s]  Can I get a look? Can I get you to say, look at me?
[3187.61s -> 3189.53s]  Look at me. Again?
[3189.53s -> 3193.21s]  Look at me. Number 13, that's all I need to see. Thank you so much. Number 13.
[3193.21s -> 3196.33s]  Thank you. Next time.
[3197.13s -> 3201.21s]  Excellent. Excellent. Wait till the door closes and we talk about it.
[3203.46s -> 3205.62s]  Donnie, when you're out, we talk about you after the door closes.
[3205.62s -> 3207.30s]  Oh, I thought you wanted to talk about me now.
[3207.30s -> 3209.14s]  No, no. When the door closes, we talk about you.
[3209.14s -> 3210.98s]  You're gonna have my ear pressed to the door.
[3210.98s -> 3211.86s]  I hope you don't do that.
[3218.31s -> 3220.39s]  Number 14, please send in number 14.
[3222.25s -> 3222.73s]  That's no.
[3222.73s -> 3224.17s]  Hey, get in here.
[3224.17s -> 3225.69s]  No, you're 14. You're 14. Come on.
[3225.69s -> 3226.09s]  I know.
[3226.09s -> 3226.89s]  How are you 14?
[3226.89s -> 3227.53s]  Nice to meet you.
[3227.53s -> 3230.49s]  Nice to meet you 14. We have Tetris here for you.
[3230.49s -> 3233.21s]  We might have to restart it, but what were you going to play for us?
[3233.21s -> 3235.37s]  I mean, I love Tetris. I was going to do House Flipper.
[3235.93s -> 3239.37s]  Do you know how to play House Flipper? Or do you know how to play Tetris?
[3239.37s -> 3240.25s]  Which is better for you?
[3240.81s -> 3242.09s]  Looks like we're going with Tetris.
[3242.73s -> 3244.17s]  Can you salvage this?
[3244.17s -> 3245.29s]  Salvage this game right now?
[3245.29s -> 3248.81s]  If you salvage this game, number 14, that is a monumental deal.
[3248.81s -> 3250.01s]  Well, look at where they left me.
[3250.97s -> 3251.21s]  Just...
[3251.85s -> 3254.57s]  By the way, number 14, did you know that the Russians played this?
[3255.21s -> 3256.25s]  The Russians played this.
[3256.25s -> 3256.75s]  Apparently.
[3258.25s -> 3258.73s]  Really?
[3258.73s -> 3260.41s]  Yeah. If you can salvage this, that's a huge deal.
[3260.41s -> 3264.97s]  Number 14, what's your favorite ride at Disney World?
[3267.13s -> 3269.78s]  I'd have to say it's a small world.
[3269.78s -> 3270.28s]  Wrong.
[3270.90s -> 3271.30s]  Correct.
[3271.30s -> 3271.94s]  Try again.
[3271.94s -> 3274.42s]  Okay. The Pirate of the Caribbean ride.
[3274.42s -> 3274.98s]  Good.
[3274.98s -> 3276.95s]  Thank you. All right.
[3279.67s -> 3280.17s]  Ah!
[3280.63s -> 3281.45s]  Not bad.
[3281.45s -> 3282.57s]  A salvage.
[3282.57s -> 3285.45s]  Pretty good salvage actually. You can use the keys too if it helps you.
[3285.45s -> 3288.94s]  I can. Which keys?
[3289.58s -> 3291.34s]  Should be the left and right arrow keys.
[3294.09s -> 3295.13s]  Oh, yes.
[3295.93s -> 3296.43s]  Not bad.
[3297.05s -> 3298.17s]  Under pressure as well.
[3298.17s -> 3299.69s]  This is huge under pressure.
[3299.69s -> 3301.21s]  I was thrown into a game.
[3301.21s -> 3303.45s]  I feel like this is what happens to people.
[3303.45s -> 3305.13s]  14, what's your favorite emote on Switch?
[3305.77s -> 3306.65s]  My favorite emote?
[3307.69s -> 3308.49s]  I'd have to say...
[3310.01s -> 3310.51s]  MonkaS.
[3312.31s -> 3312.81s]  Okay.
[3313.11s -> 3313.61s]  Thank you.
[3314.82s -> 3315.32s]  Game over.
[3315.70s -> 3316.98s]  Game over. Did you lose?
[3316.98s -> 3318.18s]  Try one more. Try one more.
[3318.18s -> 3319.78s]  I'll give you one more attempt because you knew it was a game.
[3319.78s -> 3320.28s]  Okay.
[3322.33s -> 3324.73s]  If you were to use MonkaS in a sentence, how would you use it?
[3325.69s -> 3326.33s]  I would say...
[3327.13s -> 3332.25s]  I got put in the middle of a Tetris game of someone else and I failed.
[3332.25s -> 3333.61s]  So that makes me want to go...
[3333.61s -> 3334.11s]  MonkaS.
[3335.45s -> 3336.76s]  Thank you.
[3336.76s -> 3337.26s]  Very nice.
[3337.86s -> 3338.36s]  Thank you.
[3338.36s -> 3340.51s]  Very nice.
[3344.48s -> 3346.63s]  Here we go.
[3346.63s -> 3349.51s]  By the way, I never played Tetris on my screen one time.
[3349.51s -> 3352.76s]  I think the game sucks. I think it's a stupid fucking child's game.
[3352.76s -> 3354.76s]  Well, that's why I think I should have done House Flipper.
[3354.76s -> 3355.26s]  Yeah.
[3355.56s -> 3359.06s]  I think it's a stupid game for unintelligent people.
[3360.62s -> 3361.74s]  Intelligent people play...
[3361.74s -> 3363.98s]  That must have been number 13, Joyce, so...
[3365.96s -> 3368.28s]  Actually, you're doing actually a pretty good build up on number 14.
[3369.00s -> 3369.56s]  You think so?
[3371.50s -> 3374.30s]  Oh, shit.
[3374.30s -> 3376.70s]  Oh, shoot. Number 14.
[3376.70s -> 3377.74s]  Somebody help me.
[3377.74s -> 3379.18s]  Oh, number 14.
[3379.18s -> 3381.13s]  Okay. Thank you so much, Green.
[3381.13s -> 3383.45s]  I'm going to have to cancel you out there.
[3383.45s -> 3384.01s]  I'm sorry.
[3384.01s -> 3385.13s]  Close you out there, number 14.
[3385.13s -> 3386.25s]  Thank you so much for coming.
[3386.25s -> 3386.81s]  Thank you.
[3386.81s -> 3387.93s]  Please send in number 15.
[3389.05s -> 3393.24s]  15, how are you?
[3393.24s -> 3394.36s]  I'm great. How are you?
[3394.36s -> 3395.00s]  Good to see you, 15.
[3396.12s -> 3397.48s]  All right. What are we doing?
[3397.48s -> 3398.20s]  What do you want to play for us?
[3398.20s -> 3400.68s]  We got Dark Souls, House Flipper, and Tetris.
[3400.68s -> 3402.44s]  Let's play some Tetris.
[3402.44s -> 3403.40s]  All right. You want to go Tetris?
[3403.40s -> 3403.96s]  Yeah.
[3403.96s -> 3404.92s]  You got a game going right now.
[3404.92s -> 3407.40s]  All right. Oh, but who was this person?
[3407.40s -> 3409.08s]  They didn't... I didn't do this.
[3409.08s -> 3410.04s]  This is not me.
[3410.04s -> 3411.08s]  Under Pressure was even here.
[3411.08s -> 3413.32s]  Oh, that's a great song.
[3414.04s -> 3414.76s]  It is.
[3414.76s -> 3418.36s]  Yeah. I like these pieces because they're small and compact like me.
[3419.96s -> 3422.63s]  Oh, how do I... Oh, yeah, okay.
[3422.63s -> 3423.27s]  Where do I go?
[3423.27s -> 3425.51s]  Oh, and the colors.
[3425.51s -> 3426.71s]  Oh, all the colors.
[3426.71s -> 3427.21s]  Yeah.
[3428.17s -> 3431.08s]  Okay, there we go.
[3431.08s -> 3431.96s]  Look at that.
[3431.96s -> 3433.40s]  You see that?
[3433.40s -> 3435.02s]  I wonder if you're clear.
[3435.02s -> 3437.10s]  Oh, I'll clear the line.
[3437.66s -> 3439.74s]  I'll clear it all the way down the line.
[3439.74s -> 3444.04s]  Oh, they're cooking with the gas right now.
[3447.48s -> 3448.68s]  Oh, I am prepared.
[3448.68s -> 3450.52s]  I was up all night.
[3450.52s -> 3452.28s]  Just me and some jilt cola, baby.
[3453.32s -> 3456.11s]  Oh, look at this. Look at this.
[3456.11s -> 3458.11s]  I'm building a tower of love.
[3460.11s -> 3467.07s]  Let's see how the pressure's on now.
[3467.71s -> 3468.91s]  Careful here, number 15.
[3469.31s -> 3470.75s]  I know. I know.
[3470.75s -> 3472.03s]  You're getting close.
[3472.03s -> 3475.23s]  No, but I was creating sort of a mosaic.
[3475.87s -> 3476.99s]  You know, a mosaic.
[3477.87s -> 3479.39s]  You can restart it. I want to see one more.
[3479.39s -> 3480.43s]  Okay. All right.
[3480.43s -> 3482.75s]  How do I turn these things anyway?
[3482.75s -> 3485.63s]  So you should be using the left and right arrow keys you're doing.
[3485.63s -> 3487.07s]  The knobs might be a little bit trickier for you.
[3487.07s -> 3487.79s]  Oh, I see.
[3490.68s -> 3493.32s]  Oh, I see. I see. Okay.
[3493.88s -> 3496.60s]  And then I'm going to nestle this guy in here.
[3496.60s -> 3498.44s]  I'm just going to hug him gently.
[3500.36s -> 3501.64s]  You see that? You see that?
[3501.64s -> 3502.52s]  That was very nice.
[3503.88s -> 3504.60s]  Thank you.
[3505.64s -> 3506.36s]  Very impressed.
[3506.36s -> 3510.36s]  Yeah. See, the original Game Boy was loaded with this.
[3510.36s -> 3511.48s]  Did you have a Game Boy?
[3511.48s -> 3513.00s]  I did. I won.
[3513.00s -> 3515.56s]  The only game I ever beat was DuckTales.
[3516.68s -> 3517.32s]  That's a great game.
[3517.32s -> 3518.12s]  It is a great game.
[3518.12s -> 3519.32s]  You've played one now on NES.
[3520.20s -> 3524.20s]  No, I wasn't allowed to have that because my parents don't love me.
[3525.48s -> 3528.97s]  I had to play it over at friends' homes.
[3528.97s -> 3531.50s]  I had to play it over there.
[3531.74s -> 3533.74s]  That's also where I got sugared cereal.
[3534.62s -> 3537.50s]  Nothing but bran flakes and grape nuts at my place.
[3539.12s -> 3540.32s]  Very interesting backstory.
[3542.16s -> 3543.77s]  It's a little bit of a bio there.
[3549.52s -> 3550.40s]  Hold on. I got to do this.
[3551.12s -> 3552.08s]  It feels so good.
[3552.08s -> 3552.96s]  Oh, wait. I got to do this.
[3552.96s -> 3553.44s]  Get the other one too.
[3553.44s -> 3554.00s]  Yeah, I got to do this.
[3554.00s -> 3554.64s]  It feels so good.
[3558.08s -> 3559.52s]  15. That's all I need to see.
[3559.52s -> 3560.16s]  Okay. All right.
[3560.72s -> 3562.32s]  Absolutely phenomenal job, by the way.
[3562.32s -> 3563.44s]  Brought a change of pants.
[3563.44s -> 3564.32s]  Thank God. All right.
[3564.88s -> 3566.24s]  Everybody shook their pants before they got here?
[3566.24s -> 3567.04s]  Is that a requirement?
[3569.80s -> 3570.68s]  Number 16.
[3571.24s -> 3572.76s]  You didn't think we had more than 10 people?
[3573.88s -> 3574.68s]  16, how are you?
[3574.68s -> 3575.88s]  Hi, good. How are you?
[3575.88s -> 3577.00s]  Good. I'm doing fantastic.
[3577.00s -> 3577.64s]  Nice to meet you.
[3577.64s -> 3578.52s]  Nice to meet you too.
[3578.52s -> 3579.96s]  I'm very, very happy to meet you.
[3579.96s -> 3582.92s]  We already have Tetris going, but there's also other options
[3582.92s -> 3584.20s]  if you'd like to give us something.
[3584.20s -> 3585.80s]  Cool. Could I play Dark Souls?
[3585.80s -> 3586.52s]  You absolutely could.
[3586.52s -> 3587.48s]  We have all tablets.
[3587.48s -> 3588.68s]  The controller is broken.
[3589.32s -> 3589.64s]  Unfortunate.
[3589.64s -> 3590.68s]  So you have to keyboard and mouse.
[3590.68s -> 3592.28s]  WASD, left click, right click.
[3592.28s -> 3595.16s]  R is Estus and space is dodge.
[3595.16s -> 3595.80s]  What's Perry?
[3596.44s -> 3598.36s]  Perry, good fucking question.
[3598.36s -> 3602.12s]  What if number 16, you're the first person to ask that question.
[3602.12s -> 3603.72s]  So we're going to go ahead and write that down.
[3603.72s -> 3604.28s]  Okay.
[3604.28s -> 3606.84s]  First of all, number 16, 17, no, it's 16 people,
[3606.84s -> 3609.00s]  probably nine people picked Dark Souls for some reason.
[3609.00s -> 3609.56s]  Okay, that's a lot.
[3609.56s -> 3611.24s]  And none of them have, I think,
[3612.44s -> 3614.20s]  the computer is held by about 10 percent.
[3614.20s -> 3615.64s]  So just to know that.
[3615.64s -> 3615.96s]  Okay.
[3615.96s -> 3619.24s]  I'm just going to give you a different dark soul if you're worried about that.
[3619.24s -> 3619.72s]  Okay, okay.
[3621.15s -> 3622.27s]  Tab to Perry?
[3622.27s -> 3622.59s]  Okay.
[3622.59s -> 3623.79s]  It's tab is Perry, okay.
[3623.79s -> 3624.99s]  That's what Chad says.
[3624.99s -> 3625.95s]  Oh, okay, watch.
[3625.95s -> 3627.23s]  Shift, someone says shift.
[3627.23s -> 3627.47s]  Shift.
[3627.47s -> 3628.27s]  Is shift Perry?
[3629.31s -> 3629.95s]  Ah, control.
[3629.95s -> 3630.83s]  Okay, it's control.
[3630.83s -> 3631.39s]  Okay, we're good.
[3631.39s -> 3631.95s]  We're starting, okay.
[3632.91s -> 3633.39s]  Go for it.
[3634.51s -> 3636.83s]  All right, let's play some Dark Souls here.
[3638.17s -> 3641.21s]  Get ourselves some, excuse me, sir.
[3641.21s -> 3647.77s]  I'm trying to complete something here if you'll kindly back off of me.
[3647.77s -> 3648.09s]  Thank you.
[3648.09s -> 3650.17s]  Number 16, what's the accent you're doing?
[3650.17s -> 3653.61s]  Oh, well, I figured, you know, this is the new German, right?
[3653.61s -> 3653.85s]  Yeah.
[3653.85s -> 3656.49s]  Well, why would we want the same old cookie cutter German
[3656.49s -> 3657.85s]  when we could have a new German?
[3657.85s -> 3662.49s]  You know, I think maybe new German could like be like a cowboy and have like a beard.
[3662.49s -> 3665.21s]  So, you know, like we want to constantly be improving.
[3665.21s -> 3665.45s]  Right.
[3665.45s -> 3668.81s]  So, you know, that's why I think we should kind of keep it going
[3668.81s -> 3671.37s]  but constantly strive to do better.
[3671.37s -> 3674.33s]  Okay, I guess I follow you on that a little bit here.
[3675.05s -> 3676.25s]  Are you willing to shave the beard?
[3678.24s -> 3680.00s]  Well, that's a difficult question.
[3680.00s -> 3683.60s]  I guess it depends on if it's worth it, but I suppose I could part with it.
[3684.16s -> 3687.36s]  And you're okay with a 5% royalties on the screen
[3687.36s -> 3688.56s]  and 95% going through?
[3690.46s -> 3692.06s]  Yeah, I suppose, given the numbers.
[3692.86s -> 3694.19s]  They're huge, by the way.
[3694.19s -> 3695.63s]  Yeah, that's what I want to figure.
[3696.35s -> 3699.36s]  Just making sure we get that correct before we sign anything for anybody.
[3700.40s -> 3701.68s]  It should be E to go through.
[3701.68s -> 3702.88s]  Oh, I see, okay.
[3704.00s -> 3707.20s]  You could be champion Grunder and you're the first to do that.
[3707.20s -> 3708.96s]  Let's give it a big old college try.
[3709.52s -> 3709.92s]  Good try.
[3709.92s -> 3710.40s]  Let's see what you got.
[3711.28s -> 3716.33s]  So, not to give you anything to think about why you're doing this,
[3716.33s -> 3719.77s]  but number 16, what would you say is your favorite ride at Disney win?
[3720.25s -> 3721.13s]  That's a tough one.
[3721.13s -> 3724.41s]  I'd say Big Thunder Mountain if I had to give it the old guess.
[3724.41s -> 3726.33s]  Staying with the country person.
[3726.33s -> 3728.81s]  Well, that's me and the country person thing.
[3729.77s -> 3731.71s]  Dude, we're going to lean into that, okay?
[3731.71s -> 3734.11s]  What's your favorite food?
[3735.39s -> 3737.07s]  I'd say chicken fried steak.
[3739.39s -> 3741.63s]  Listen, I don't break character ever.
[3741.63s -> 3742.59s]  You better believe me.
[3744.51s -> 3745.95s]  Okay, I'm going to look at these books.
[3745.95s -> 3746.45s]  Yeah.
[3751.55s -> 3755.07s]  Number 16, can I just say, look at me loudly and put your hands in your mouth?
[3755.07s -> 3755.55s]  Look at me.
[3756.67s -> 3757.47s]  Look at me.
[3757.47s -> 3758.35s]  Oh, hold on.
[3758.35s -> 3759.55s]  I've got a good master's here.
[3760.51s -> 3761.63s]  Is it good for your health?
[3767.55s -> 3768.19s]  Holy shit.
[3768.19s -> 3769.55s]  Are you going to beat Gundyr?
[3769.55s -> 3770.59s]  I mean, it's Gundyr.
[3770.59s -> 3771.39s]  It's not that hard.
[3772.19s -> 3772.83s]  Wow.
[3772.83s -> 3773.79s]  Number 16.
[3774.51s -> 3775.55s]  Number 16.
[3780.43s -> 3781.31s]  All right, Gigi.
[3781.31s -> 3782.19s]  You just beat Gundyr.
[3782.91s -> 3783.71s]  You just did it.
[3783.71s -> 3784.83s]  You just beat Gundyr.
[3784.83s -> 3786.11s]  No, it's even gone through the door.
[3786.11s -> 3788.35s]  I usually play on key on controller.
[3788.35s -> 3789.87s]  I don't know if that's a problem.
[3789.87s -> 3791.31s]  Number 16, that was phenomenal.
[3791.31s -> 3793.31s]  I just have to be very, I got to make sure you really wear this.
[3794.11s -> 3794.99s]  That beard though.
[3795.79s -> 3797.71s]  Is that just, that's, you just got to go.
[3798.43s -> 3800.17s]  That beard has to go.
[3800.17s -> 3801.05s]  Okay.
[3801.05s -> 3803.69s]  Well, sometimes we got to make sacrifices.
[3804.65s -> 3805.29s]  Thank you so much.
[3805.29s -> 3806.01s]  That was fantastic.
[3806.01s -> 3806.57s]  Number 16.
[3806.57s -> 3807.53s]  You can send it number 17.
[3807.53s -> 3809.21s]  I'm sure that was phenomenal.
[3809.21s -> 3810.49s]  Y'all come back now here.
[3811.29s -> 3813.05s]  I don't know why you keep doing this country thing.
[3813.05s -> 3814.25s]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[3814.25s -> 3816.97s]  Because I'm literally from the East Coast, from like Boston.
[3816.97s -> 3818.09s]  Like I could see like in New York.
[3819.13s -> 3820.33s]  Send number 17, please.
[3820.33s -> 3822.01s]  And that should round us out.
[3822.73s -> 3823.45s]  Number 17.
[3824.49s -> 3828.80s]  Do we not have 17?
[3828.80s -> 3829.60s]  17 is not here.
[3832.52s -> 3833.88s]  Number 17 is not here.
[3833.88s -> 3835.32s]  We have number 16 is there.
[3837.39s -> 3838.19s]  Okay.
[3838.19s -> 3840.49s]  That's the best we got.
[3841.21s -> 3843.71s]  That's what we got.
[3843.71s -> 3845.87s]  I mean, it was never classified in the country.
[3845.87s -> 3847.07s]  And all the newspapers in the country.
[3849.05s -> 3849.53s]  Okay.
[3849.53s -> 3852.25s]  I, this is going to take a little bit of deliberation here.
[3853.79s -> 3854.83s]  I have no fucking idea.
[3856.83s -> 3860.11s]  I'm, give me, I don't know if I'm addressing this camera here.
[3860.11s -> 3861.63s]  But like, give me a few minutes.
[3862.27s -> 3863.79s]  I need to think about what I'm going to do about this.
[3864.59s -> 3870.22s]  Because there are 16, there are 16 people here that I mean, I don't know.
[3870.22s -> 3871.02s]  I have no idea.
[3871.02s -> 3871.82s]  I'm going to need a few minutes.
[3871.82s -> 3872.70s]  Give us a few minutes.
[3872.70s -> 3874.78s]  Let me deliberate on this and think about what I want to do here.
[3875.50s -> 3878.06s]  And we'll be right back in just a few minutes.
[5104.88s -> 5151.21s]  Phone of friends.
[5151.21s -> 5154.88s]  So this is harder than I thought it was going to be, unfortunately.
[5154.88s -> 5156.40s]  I knew it was going to be hard.
[5156.64s -> 5163.18s]  But trying to eliminate people is not my, my forefront.
[5163.90s -> 5165.26s]  But I will do my best.
[5166.14s -> 5170.81s]  I'm going to have to say I've spent 10, 20 minutes sitting here trying to figure out
[5170.81s -> 5171.61s]  what I want to do here.
[5172.41s -> 5173.71s]  I'm going to have to cut.
[5175.56s -> 5177.48s]  I mean, number, I mean, number seven, Connor.
[5178.44s -> 5179.08s]  What are you doing here?
[5179.08s -> 5179.80s]  Connor Reid's pants.
[5179.80s -> 5183.08s]  You've got, you have a career going for yourself for the love of God.
[5183.88s -> 5184.76s]  You're a young guy.
[5184.76s -> 5186.36s]  You've got a great career in front of you.
[5186.36s -> 5187.24s]  You don't, you don't got to be me.
[5187.24s -> 5187.88s]  Be you.
[5187.88s -> 5189.64s]  And you, you're doing you very well.
[5191.05s -> 5194.65s]  Also, I mean, the number 12 didn't know how to play Tetris.
[5195.85s -> 5196.81s]  Just get out of here.
[5196.81s -> 5198.49s]  I mean, what, what are we going to do with you?
[5199.53s -> 5203.76s]  And then probably at the same time, I mean, number 16 as well.
[5204.64s -> 5205.76s]  We actually talked backstage.
[5205.76s -> 5208.08s]  He didn't want to shave his beard once and for all.
[5208.08s -> 5212.88s]  So I was like, I mean, if you're not going to shave how he, yeah.
[5212.88s -> 5214.08s]  Oh, country German.
[5214.08s -> 5215.12s]  That's not going to happen, man.
[5216.32s -> 5218.32s]  That's all I could come up with so far.
[5218.96s -> 5220.80s]  I sat for 10, 20 minutes.
[5220.80s -> 5221.60s]  Remember, this is me.
[5221.60s -> 5223.05s]  This is my shit.
[5223.05s -> 5225.04s]  This is my channel.
[5225.04s -> 5226.72s]  I have to be sure of this stuff.
[5227.87s -> 5230.43s]  So what's going to have to happen here over the next,
[5231.23s -> 5232.35s]  I don't know how long it's going to take,
[5232.35s -> 5236.91s]  but I've employed a few people to try to really narrow down
[5236.91s -> 5239.39s]  who I think could be the next German 985.
[5240.94s -> 5242.14s]  I need some help.
[5242.14s -> 5243.90s]  I need some more context.
[5244.78s -> 5246.78s]  So let's go ahead and start episode one,
[5246.78s -> 5249.90s]  season one, episode one, final pilot one,
[5249.90s -> 5254.01s]  end of the series one, final episode one
[5254.01s -> 5259.63s]  of Who Will Replace Me on German 985.
[5260.43s -> 5273.53s]  Hello. How are you?
[5273.53s -> 5278.41s]  Welcome to Who Will Replace Me on German 985.
[5278.41s -> 5279.53s]  I'm German 985.
[5279.53s -> 5280.41s]  Welcome. How are you?
[5281.05s -> 5282.81s]  I figured this would be probably hard to do.
[5283.53s -> 5285.13s]  So I have employed a few people,
[5285.69s -> 5287.45s]  at least a handful of people to help me do this.
[5288.17s -> 5290.65s]  And we'll go one by one to find out
[5290.65s -> 5293.95s]  who could help me decide who could replace me.
[5293.95s -> 5295.31s]  So we'll go back over here.
[5295.31s -> 5296.11s]  We have Ster here.
[5296.75s -> 5298.27s]  Nice to meet you, everyone.
[5298.27s -> 5300.03s]  I've known Germa a long time,
[5300.03s -> 5302.11s]  so I've been judging him my whole life,
[5302.11s -> 5305.15s]  and I feel like I'm especially qualified for this opportunity.
[5305.15s -> 5306.19s]  Camera's over there, honey.
[5309.50s -> 5311.18s]  I apologize. He's judging me.
[5311.82s -> 5314.14s]  I know. I'm just ready to figure out who the new Germa is.
[5314.14s -> 5315.74s]  I've been waiting for a new one for a long time,
[5315.74s -> 5316.70s]  and I hope we get, you know,
[5316.70s -> 5318.14s]  a better result than the first one.
[5318.14s -> 5318.64s]  Yeah.
[5320.12s -> 5321.48s]  By the way, when you talk about judges,
[5322.04s -> 5323.16s]  I had to bring people in
[5323.16s -> 5325.56s]  because there's no way I can do this by myself.
[5326.60s -> 5329.48s]  It was impossible to sit there and be like,
[5329.48s -> 5331.80s]  oh, who's better? Who can do it? Who can't do it?
[5332.60s -> 5333.48s]  I need experts.
[5333.48s -> 5335.00s]  And Ster has been around for a long time.
[5335.00s -> 5336.92s]  He's been around for about 12 years now
[5336.92s -> 5338.28s]  since the very, very, very beginning.
[5338.28s -> 5340.36s]  I'm 31. I've been around for 31 years.
[5340.36s -> 5341.96s]  We also have Ludwig here.
[5341.96s -> 5344.68s]  Ludwig is also part of the new school of Germa fans.
[5344.68s -> 5346.36s]  He's been around for like the last few years.
[5347.00s -> 5348.68s]  Ludwig, thanks so much for showing up here.
[5348.68s -> 5349.88s]  Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[5350.52s -> 5351.40s]  You know, I'm one of the few people
[5351.40s -> 5352.60s]  who actually took your role,
[5353.34s -> 5355.98s]  and your chat tried to kill me.
[5355.98s -> 5356.78s]  They did?
[5356.78s -> 5357.82s]  So I'm just trying to make sure
[5357.82s -> 5362.01s]  whoever we pick today is not at threat to die.
[5362.01s -> 5364.57s]  It's really, I couldn't do it.
[5364.57s -> 5366.49s]  When 16 people come in the room,
[5368.01s -> 5370.73s]  it's hard to base who I can do it on.
[5373.42s -> 5374.46s]  Why was that funny?
[5374.46s -> 5374.94s]  I don't know.
[5374.94s -> 5376.06s]  There's just a couple of words there.
[5376.86s -> 5379.02s]  Our third, our fourth judge
[5379.10s -> 5381.34s]  is somebody, a fan favorite of the channel.
[5382.86s -> 5383.82s]  He's my doctor.
[5383.82s -> 5385.82s]  He's been around since I can really remember.
[5386.70s -> 5389.10s]  To make sure blood pressure, blood type,
[5389.10s -> 5390.86s]  and all that is exact.
[5390.86s -> 5393.50s]  Dr. Schmikeson, thank you for coming out here.
[5393.50s -> 5394.38s]  Thank you.
[5394.38s -> 5396.06s]  Thank you so much for inviting me
[5396.06s -> 5397.90s]  to be on your panel, Jeremy.
[5397.90s -> 5399.42s]  And as you know, the others
[5399.42s -> 5401.26s]  might be interested in your talents,
[5401.26s -> 5406.22s]  but as a doctor, I know Germa Jeremy.
[5406.22s -> 5407.42s]  He knows me in and out.
[5407.42s -> 5408.22s]  In and out completely.
[5408.22s -> 5408.86s]  Wow.
[5408.86s -> 5410.06s]  Yeah, blood type.
[5410.06s -> 5411.42s]  We're talking blood pressure.
[5411.42s -> 5413.34s]  And he doesn't have very much time left, right?
[5414.38s -> 5415.26s]  For me?
[5415.26s -> 5416.62s]  I didn't think we were going to bring that up.
[5417.82s -> 5418.46s]  Am I dying?
[5419.10s -> 5419.90s]  I didn't know this.
[5420.54s -> 5421.58s]  I'd like to talk to you later
[5421.58s -> 5422.46s]  about some Germa fans.
[5422.46s -> 5424.46s]  Dr. Schmikeson, Ludwig and Ster
[5424.46s -> 5425.74s]  to judge these people.
[5425.74s -> 5427.90s]  Because I mean, we're talking about my replacement.
[5427.90s -> 5429.98s]  And I've been a content creator.
[5429.98s -> 5431.42s]  You've been a content creator, Ster,
[5431.42s -> 5432.86s]  for about 12 years now.
[5433.58s -> 5435.26s]  And trying to find the person
[5435.26s -> 5437.58s]  that can take the brand to the next level.
[5438.54s -> 5439.42s]  We're going to find that now.
[5440.46s -> 5441.66s]  By the way, let's explain
[5441.66s -> 5442.78s]  how this is going to work.
[5443.50s -> 5445.82s]  We have in front of us here, we have buttons.
[5446.62s -> 5448.06s]  People are going to come out on stage.
[5448.78s -> 5450.62s]  I've eliminated a few people off the bat
[5450.62s -> 5452.94s]  because I don't think they can handle it, by the way.
[5452.94s -> 5454.70s]  But we have a few buttons here.
[5455.26s -> 5456.86s]  When we press these buttons,
[5457.66s -> 5458.94s]  they are going to play.
[5458.94s -> 5460.38s]  Okay, we don't all have to do it.
[5460.38s -> 5461.34s]  We're demonstrating.
[5461.34s -> 5462.14s]  They don't believe us.
[5464.00s -> 5465.20s]  It makes this noise.
[5465.28s -> 5465.76s]  Three...
[5468.38s -> 5470.46s]  Three Xs means you are out.
[5471.10s -> 5473.66s]  Three Yeses means you are into the next round.
[5474.38s -> 5476.46s]  This is a talent portion of this stream here.
[5477.90s -> 5481.02s]  We got Dr. Schmikeson, Ster, Ludwig.
[5481.66s -> 5482.38s]  I think...
[5482.38s -> 5483.98s]  Me, I'm judging you too.
[5483.98s -> 5485.26s]  They're all backstage right now.
[5485.26s -> 5486.78s]  Who knows Jerma better than Jerma?
[5487.42s -> 5487.90s]  Exactly.
[5487.90s -> 5488.62s]  Who would know me...
[5488.62s -> 5489.82s]  Who would know me better than me?
[5489.82s -> 5490.78s]  Nobody does.
[5490.78s -> 5491.26s]  I know...
[5491.26s -> 5492.54s]  Actually, I don't know me at all.
[5492.54s -> 5494.54s]  That's why you were here.
[5495.10s -> 5496.22s]  You lose yourself sometimes.
[5496.22s -> 5498.22s]  I lose myself sometimes, but it's okay.
[5499.34s -> 5501.10s]  I would like to call to the stage now.
[5501.10s -> 5502.30s]  You got soda right here
[5502.30s -> 5504.62s]  because just like that show that we can't say,
[5505.26s -> 5506.06s]  it's delicious.
[5506.06s -> 5507.42s]  It's got soda in there.
[5507.42s -> 5507.98s]  Drink it up.
[5509.28s -> 5511.04s]  Can we get number one to come out on stage, please?
[5515.45s -> 5517.37s]  Three Xs means you are out.
[5517.37s -> 5519.61s]  Three Yeses means you are into the next round.
[5519.61s -> 5520.89s]  Number one, how are you?
[5520.89s -> 5521.69s]  I am very well.
[5521.69s -> 5522.65s]  How are you?
[5522.65s -> 5523.37s]  Thank you, number one.
[5523.37s -> 5523.77s]  How are you?
[5523.77s -> 5524.41s]  Good.
[5524.41s -> 5525.13s]  Great.
[5525.13s -> 5526.17s]  Nobody's X-ed, right?
[5526.65s -> 5527.29s]  Okay.
[5527.29s -> 5528.65s]  I like the walk a lot.
[5528.65s -> 5529.69s]  That's how you walk around.
[5529.69s -> 5530.49s]  That's a good walker.
[5530.49s -> 5530.99s]  Look at me.
[5532.33s -> 5533.45s]  Somebody, somebody got it.
[5533.45s -> 5534.41s]  Finally, somebody got it right.
[5535.21s -> 5537.13s]  Number one, what are you going to do for us today?
[5537.13s -> 5539.29s]  I believe I'm going to juggle today for it.
[5539.29s -> 5539.77s]  Juggling, okay.
[5539.77s -> 5542.73s]  Maybe sing a few bars of my favorite song as well.
[5542.73s -> 5543.23s]  Okay.
[5543.93s -> 5546.01s]  Whenever you're ready, we'll go ahead and get that started.
[5547.61s -> 5548.11s]  Thank you.
[5556.52s -> 5557.56s]  No, pull it back.
[5557.56s -> 5558.04s]  Pull it back.
[5558.04s -> 5558.60s]  That's not fair.
[5561.15s -> 5561.65s]  Okay.
[5562.37s -> 5567.47s]  I just want the next hour to be this.
[5568.67s -> 5570.19s]  Could you make a German noise while doing it?
[5570.99s -> 5571.39s]  Higher.
[5571.95s -> 5572.35s]  Higher.
[5573.23s -> 5574.67s]  Oh, he dropped one.
[5574.67s -> 5575.71s]  What do we do about that?
[5575.71s -> 5576.21s]  Higher.
[5576.83s -> 5577.33s]  Higher.
[5579.07s -> 5579.57s]  Higher.
[5580.27s -> 5581.15s]  Can you go higher?
[5581.15s -> 5581.65s]  Go higher.
[5584.35s -> 5585.39s]  No, don't take that back.
[5586.99s -> 5588.51s]  Does he think we're going to hire in notes?
[5589.31s -> 5589.81s]  What is that?
[5594.69s -> 5597.17s]  Fan, I'm not going to say anything.
[5599.26s -> 5599.66s]  Is that it?
[5600.86s -> 5602.30s]  Here, I'll try one more for you.
[5602.30s -> 5602.78s]  Hold on.
[5602.78s -> 5603.28s]  Great.
[5610.86s -> 5612.06s]  That might have got me.
[5612.06s -> 5612.56s]  That got me.
[5613.10s -> 5613.60s]  Wow.
[5614.86s -> 5616.14s]  Number one, number one.
[5617.70s -> 5619.18s]  Okay.
[5619.18s -> 5623.44s]  Chefs, I would say I'm going to have to be a yes on this one.
[5624.24s -> 5628.08s]  Uh, you know, I was almost a no and I was sitting there and I was thinking
[5628.08s -> 5630.48s]  he's not doing anything with the lower half of his body.
[5630.48s -> 5632.72s]  And then when you incorporated the leg...
[5635.71s -> 5636.59s]  I'm sorry.
[5636.59s -> 5637.79s]  You've been disqualified.
[5637.79s -> 5638.19s]  I get it.
[5638.19s -> 5638.99s]  I totally understand.
[5639.79s -> 5640.67s]  It's okay.
[5640.67s -> 5641.95s]  I enjoyed the performance.
[5642.75s -> 5647.23s]  Can you explain what the thought process between ah-ee-oo was?
[5647.23s -> 5647.87s]  Very good.
[5647.87s -> 5648.51s]  Very good idea.
[5649.47s -> 5650.51s]  It's the greatest song in the world.
[5650.51s -> 5651.23s]  It's my favorite song.
[5651.71s -> 5657.15s]  Could you give me just a five-second interpretation of what a Raid song is?
[5657.15s -> 5657.65s]  Okay.
[5658.27s -> 5658.99s]  A Raid song?
[5658.99s -> 5659.95s]  A Raid song.
[5659.95s -> 5660.67s]  Raid song.
[5660.67s -> 5661.17s]  Yeah.
[5665.31s -> 5665.81s]  Pull it back.
[5666.51s -> 5666.91s]  Pull it back.
[5666.91s -> 5667.41s]  He goes first.
[5668.43s -> 5670.35s]  I don't know what my status is right now.
[5671.87s -> 5672.35s]  It's, uh...
[5672.35s -> 5674.19s]  Dr. Schmeichsen, what do you have to say?
[5674.19s -> 5675.15s]  Yes, yes.
[5675.15s -> 5676.43s]  Thank you, number one.
[5676.43s -> 5684.58s]  Number one, I just try to match things with this person at the other end of the table.
[5685.14s -> 5687.62s]  What is your basic metabolic rate?
[5688.34s -> 5688.84s]  Yeah.
[5689.38s -> 5694.38s]  So we got two X's here so far.
[5694.38s -> 5695.26s]  I think you pulled it back.
[5695.26s -> 5695.50s]  I don't...
[5695.50s -> 5696.14s]  Did you pull it back?
[5696.14s -> 5697.34s]  You pulled it back.
[5697.34s -> 5698.30s]  It's back up again.
[5698.30s -> 5699.34s]  It's back up again.
[5699.34s -> 5700.14s]  No time left.
[5700.14s -> 5700.62s]  Sorry.
[5700.62s -> 5702.86s]  Okay, so two nos and two yeses.
[5703.82s -> 5705.18s]  I'm currently at a no.
[5705.18s -> 5705.68s]  I...
[5707.01s -> 5707.65s]  Whoa, whoa!
[5707.65s -> 5708.37s]  I don't know what...
[5708.37s -> 5709.49s]  You decided for me.
[5709.49s -> 5710.53s]  You hit my hand.
[5710.53s -> 5711.33s]  That was a joke.
[5711.33s -> 5711.83s]  Pull it back.
[5712.85s -> 5714.21s]  That's a yes from me.
[5714.21s -> 5716.29s]  I think the leg was fantastic.
[5716.29s -> 5718.05s]  Honestly, the leg was fantastic.
[5718.05s -> 5718.85s]  I think that's a good move.
[5718.85s -> 5719.41s]  We're split.
[5719.41s -> 5719.97s]  What do you want?
[5719.97s -> 5722.37s]  What do you want from our side, from our delegation?
[5722.37s -> 5724.02s]  He's got the look.
[5724.02s -> 5724.58s]  Uh-huh.
[5724.58s -> 5725.46s]  He's got the passion.
[5726.02s -> 5728.26s]  Schmeichsen, look, I would pull it back.
[5728.26s -> 5729.70s]  Can you do the thing one more time?
[5729.70s -> 5730.34s]  Which thing?
[5730.34s -> 5731.30s]  The leg, the leg.
[5731.30s -> 5731.94s]  With the leg.
[5731.94s -> 5732.42s]  Juggling leg.
[5732.42s -> 5733.46s]  Yeah, just one more.
[5733.46s -> 5734.26s]  One more time, please.
[5736.53s -> 5737.03s]  Okay.
[5738.83s -> 5739.47s]  Oh, shit.
[5739.47s -> 5740.27s]  I'm pulling it back.
[5740.27s -> 5740.83s]  That's classic.
[5740.91s -> 5741.95s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5741.95s -> 5742.91s]  That's classic.
[5742.91s -> 5743.63s]  Good.
[5743.63s -> 5744.35s]  That's good.
[5744.35s -> 5745.47s]  Why did you say no?
[5745.47s -> 5747.15s]  I say no because he dropped it.
[5747.15s -> 5748.43s]  What about classic Jerma?
[5748.43s -> 5749.07s]  We're split.
[5749.63s -> 5751.07s]  We want a better Jerma.
[5751.07s -> 5751.87s]  No, no, he pulled it back.
[5751.87s -> 5753.23s]  I want the cowboy Jerma.
[5753.23s -> 5754.27s]  We want a better Jerma.
[5754.27s -> 5754.99s]  Only three yeses.
[5754.99s -> 5755.95s]  We both pulled.
[5755.95s -> 5756.83s]  That's three yeses.
[5756.83s -> 5757.95s]  Yeah, we're at three yeses.
[5757.95s -> 5758.51s]  That's three.
[5758.51s -> 5759.63s]  You're going through to the next round.
[5759.63s -> 5760.13s]  Thank you!
[5761.15s -> 5761.65s]  Yes!
[5762.27s -> 5762.75s]  Yeah!
[5762.75s -> 5763.39s]  Number one!
[5765.18s -> 5765.90s]  Okay.
[5765.90s -> 5767.42s]  You're not known for your clutch.
[5767.42s -> 5768.86s]  He's got one trick and two notes.
[5768.86s -> 5769.90s]  But he went under the leg.
[5769.90s -> 5770.86s]  That's a huge deal.
[5770.86s -> 5771.36s]  It is.
[5771.90s -> 5772.38s]  Number two.
[5772.38s -> 5773.58s]  If we get number two to come out.
[5774.22s -> 5775.34s]  Sir, you got your exit.
[5775.34s -> 5775.98s]  We got to clear it.
[5777.89s -> 5778.85s]  Dr. Shmoekson.
[5778.85s -> 5779.41s]  Yes, sir.
[5779.41s -> 5781.09s]  You have tested all the blood pressure,
[5781.81s -> 5782.77s]  all the blood types,
[5784.53s -> 5788.29s]  all the different height levels of all the patients here.
[5788.85s -> 5791.49s]  Can you reliably say that all these people could be
[5792.05s -> 5793.17s]  the next Jerma 95?
[5794.05s -> 5798.77s]  With some stipulation, I think that they're very close.
[5798.77s -> 5799.41s]  Okay, good.
[5800.29s -> 5801.09s]  I apologize.
[5801.17s -> 5802.21s]  We're calling them patients?
[5804.94s -> 5806.54s]  I mean someone, yeah.
[5806.54s -> 5807.58s]  We're calling them patients.
[5807.58s -> 5808.08s]  Okay.
[5809.74s -> 5810.86s]  Not for you!
[5810.86s -> 5811.50s]  That's not for you.
[5812.22s -> 5813.18s]  Tell us your name.
[5813.18s -> 5814.22s]  It's a pleasure to meet you.
[5814.22s -> 5814.72s]  Number two.
[5814.72s -> 5815.90s]  My name is Austin.
[5815.90s -> 5816.40s]  Okay.
[5816.40s -> 5818.14s]  And I'm gonna play a little song for you guys.
[5818.78s -> 5819.58s]  Okay, don't buzz it.
[5819.58s -> 5820.46s]  What's the wrong name?
[5822.58s -> 5823.38s]  I'm sorry, I guess...
[5825.62s -> 5827.38s]  Your name's supposed to be Jerma now.
[5827.38s -> 5828.58s]  Austin doesn't make sense.
[5828.58s -> 5829.22s]  Can we?
[5829.22s -> 5830.34s]  Is it Austin 985?
[5830.34s -> 5831.86s]  No, clear the board.
[5831.86s -> 5833.06s]  Clear the board for the love of God.
[5833.06s -> 5833.56s]  All agree!
[5833.86s -> 5834.36s]  All agree!
[5834.36s -> 5834.86s]  Oh, all right, all right!
[5834.86s -> 5835.36s]  There we are!
[5835.36s -> 5835.86s]  There we are!
[5835.86s -> 5836.98s]  We have my attention.
[5836.98s -> 5837.62s]  Clear the board.
[5838.74s -> 5839.62s]  We all clear?
[5839.62s -> 5840.26s]  I think we're cleared.
[5840.26s -> 5840.82s]  I think we're cleared.
[5840.82s -> 5841.32s]  Number two.
[5841.32s -> 5842.02s]  I think we're clear.
[5842.02s -> 5843.22s]  What are you gonna do for us today?
[5843.22s -> 5844.50s]  I'm gonna play a little song for you guys.
[5844.50s -> 5845.00s]  Okay.
[5845.14s -> 5845.64s]  All right.
[5845.64s -> 5846.14s]  Sounds good.
[5895.79s -> 5897.79s]  Now it's so sweet
[5901.71s -> 5902.91s]  Better Jerma!
[5902.91s -> 5903.41s]  Hey!
[5903.41s -> 5903.91s]  Yes!
[5903.91s -> 5904.79s]  I wouldn't say that.
[5907.36s -> 5909.36s]  The real Jerma would have got distracted by that.
[5909.36s -> 5911.36s]  Pause, time, pause, pause.
[5911.36s -> 5912.48s]  Pause right now.
[5914.96s -> 5917.76s]  It'd be nice having music in the background.
[5918.64s -> 5920.64s]  Don't you think it's like too much, though?
[5921.36s -> 5922.40s]  Music Mondays.
[5923.12s -> 5924.00s]  You think it's fun?
[5924.00s -> 5924.50s]  Yeah.
[5924.66s -> 5925.70s]  I'm actually, I'm rescinding.
[5925.70s -> 5926.98s]  Music Mondays, let's go.
[5926.98s -> 5927.78s]  All right, number two.
[5927.78s -> 5929.30s]  Number two, thank you so much.
[5929.30s -> 5929.80s]  Number two.
[5930.72s -> 5931.68s]  Very, very good job.
[5931.68s -> 5932.18s]  Number two.
[5932.18s -> 5933.28s]  Oh, thanks so much.
[5933.28s -> 5937.04s]  We have, uh, we have a couple of, one no for instance here?
[5937.04s -> 5940.88s]  Um, you know, I'll take it back if you can answer this question well.
[5940.88s -> 5944.16s]  I mean, you already got three yeses, but you know, maybe you can make your case.
[5945.76s -> 5948.08s]  Really, why do you want to be Jerma?
[5948.08s -> 5948.64s]  Yeah.
[5948.64s -> 5953.36s]  Well, I just feel like, you know, teaching kids how to, how to farm properly
[5953.36s -> 5956.96s]  and, uh, and maintain their farms would be the best way to use my streaming services
[5956.96s -> 5957.84s]  and take it over for Jerma.
[5957.84s -> 5958.88s]  I mean, what a great audience.
[5958.88s -> 5959.84s]  He's got a good point.
[5959.84s -> 5960.34s]  Did he?
[5960.80s -> 5965.04s]  Oh, you said it was, you can't just keep going, sir.
[5965.04s -> 5965.92s]  Can I ask you a question?
[5965.92s -> 5966.24s]  Uh-huh.
[5966.24s -> 5967.36s]  How tall are you?
[5967.36s -> 5968.24s]  I'm five foot eight.
[5968.24s -> 5968.72s]  Perfect.
[5968.72s -> 5969.22s]  Perfect.
[5970.48s -> 5972.32s]  Dr. Schmuckson, do you have anything to add to that?
[5973.28s -> 5980.32s]  Yes, I actually, um, number two, I thought that was polymorphically awesome.
[5980.32s -> 5982.88s]  So, uh, I guess it's a go.
[5982.96s -> 5983.52s]  That's a go?
[5983.52s -> 5984.02s]  Yeah.
[5984.02s -> 5984.64s]  Yeah.
[5984.64s -> 5985.14s]  You know.
[5985.14s -> 5986.72s]  One X, but I'll take all three.
[5986.72s -> 5987.44s]  No, that's a yes.
[5987.44s -> 5987.92s]  That's a yes.
[5987.92s -> 5988.72s]  You're going on to the next round.
[5988.72s -> 5988.96s]  All right.
[5988.96s -> 5989.68s]  Great job.
[5989.68s -> 5990.48s]  I want to make sure that.
[5990.48s -> 5991.20s]  Great job.
[5991.20s -> 5994.16s]  You can't just fucking press the button like over and over again.
[5994.16s -> 5995.52s]  I don't want him to be the new you.
[5995.52s -> 5996.00s]  That's annoying.
[5996.00s -> 5997.36s]  You're better than that, Jerma.
[5997.36s -> 5997.84s]  You're annoying.
[5998.96s -> 5999.68s]  You're annoying.
[5999.68s -> 6000.40s]  I'm here for you.
[6001.44s -> 6003.57s]  Can you switch seats with him potentially?
[6005.27s -> 6005.83s]  Are we all clear?
[6005.83s -> 6006.23s]  I'll be good.
[6006.23s -> 6006.47s]  I'll be good.
[6006.47s -> 6009.11s]  Can we send out number three, please, or whoever's in the next line here?
[6009.11s -> 6010.55s]  I'll just pick whichever person you pick.
[6010.55s -> 6011.51s]  Holy smokes!
[6011.51s -> 6012.39s]  We've got number three here.
[6012.39s -> 6013.27s]  Wow.
[6013.27s -> 6014.23s]  I'm here.
[6014.23s -> 6015.35s]  Look at me.
[6015.35s -> 6016.07s]  He's got to look at me.
[6016.95s -> 6017.99s]  Right, right.
[6017.99s -> 6019.75s]  You have nice arms, right, Jerma?
[6019.75s -> 6021.27s]  No, I've got arms, yeah.
[6021.27s -> 6021.91s]  Oh, yeah.
[6022.55s -> 6024.07s]  Are you in the gym more than once a week?
[6024.87s -> 6026.39s]  I mean, home gym.
[6026.39s -> 6026.79s]  Okay.
[6026.79s -> 6027.27s]  Home gym.
[6027.27s -> 6027.91s]  He's got a home gym.
[6027.91s -> 6028.47s]  That's pretty good.
[6029.19s -> 6031.35s]  So number three, what are you going to do for us?
[6031.35s -> 6033.27s]  Seems like you already kind of have an idea here.
[6033.83s -> 6039.27s]  Well, I mean, still walking is pretty much an atmospheric talent.
[6039.75s -> 6046.23s]  So normally it's for creating an illusion of, you know, heightened magic.
[6046.87s -> 6047.83s]  Without the actual magic.
[6047.83s -> 6049.19s]  How tall are you right now?
[6049.19s -> 6050.07s]  Do you know?
[6050.07s -> 6050.79s]  Taller than you.
[6051.51s -> 6052.07s]  Okay.
[6052.07s -> 6055.59s]  I hear you're 5'8", but I can teach you.
[6055.59s -> 6056.39s]  That's fucked up.
[6056.39s -> 6058.95s]  In your retirement, you can be as tall as me.
[6058.95s -> 6060.07s]  Because I am also 5'8".
[6061.83s -> 6063.03s]  How tall do the stilts make you?
[6063.03s -> 6063.91s]  A little bit.
[6063.91s -> 6064.55s]  Seven foot?
[6065.75s -> 6066.87s]  About eight foot.
[6066.87s -> 6068.47s]  Okay, that's a lot of foot.
[6069.03s -> 6071.99s]  All right, so are you going to do a routine for us?
[6071.99s -> 6072.87s]  Are you going to walk around?
[6073.67s -> 6078.63s]  More or less, it's kind of, like I said, it's more of an atmospheric talent
[6078.63s -> 6082.16s]  where you can more or less do photo logs.
[6082.16s -> 6082.80s]  Do you do flips?
[6083.84s -> 6088.16s]  In a world that we all live in, me and you, I can reach taller things.
[6088.16s -> 6090.56s]  So I feel like I'm an improved germa.
[6090.56s -> 6094.52s]  And as you can see, I'm also firma.
[6095.40s -> 6096.31s]  Firma.
[6097.19s -> 6099.88s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6099.88s -> 6100.84s]  Don't clap yet.
[6101.48s -> 6102.60s]  Excuse me.
[6102.60s -> 6104.68s]  We're allowed to have our own thoughts.
[6104.68s -> 6106.20s]  What's your fursona?
[6106.20s -> 6108.92s]  My fursona is a wolf.
[6111.91s -> 6112.87s]  Okay, all right.
[6112.87s -> 6113.43s]  You know what?
[6113.43s -> 6117.59s]  I will actually, from earlier, I want to correct a mistake that I made.
[6117.59s -> 6119.35s]  I said I didn't like rats.
[6119.35s -> 6122.15s]  I want to make it clear that I do like rats,
[6122.15s -> 6125.43s]  as long as I am the large rat that makes all the rules.
[6125.43s -> 6125.93s]  Interesting.
[6127.11s -> 6128.95s]  Is that why you have a wolf tail on, sir?
[6129.91s -> 6131.73s]  You know what?
[6131.73s -> 6134.53s]  The internet is very limited on what you can buy in two-day shipping.
[6134.53s -> 6135.03s]  Okay.
[6136.21s -> 6137.84s]  It's a global pandemic.
[6137.84s -> 6138.34s]  True, true.
[6139.44s -> 6142.24s]  We've got two no's here, I think.
[6142.24s -> 6143.20s]  Oh, no.
[6143.20s -> 6144.08s]  What can I do?
[6144.08s -> 6144.58s]  Tell me.
[6145.52s -> 6147.44s]  Dr. Smikson, what do you got here?
[6148.16s -> 6150.16s]  Well, can you...
[6151.04s -> 6151.88s]  Let's see.
[6152.98s -> 6154.98s]  Turn to your left, please.
[6156.26s -> 6157.06s]  Raise your right arm.
[6159.04s -> 6160.32s]  Make a raspberry noise.
[6162.64s -> 6164.56s]  Hmm, uh, no, sorry.
[6167.30s -> 6168.98s]  I'm so sorry, number three.
[6170.02s -> 6172.58s]  That is unless we can come up with some kind of agreement.
[6172.58s -> 6174.26s]  I'm sorry, that's where your journey ends here.
[6174.26s -> 6177.22s]  I mean, I was gonna give you free lessons on still walking, but I mean...
[6177.22s -> 6178.58s]  Oh, I can still take them.
[6179.38s -> 6180.26s]  I can still take them.
[6180.26s -> 6181.06s]  I'll pay.
[6181.06s -> 6181.78s]  All right.
[6181.78s -> 6182.90s]  Very exorbitantly.
[6182.90s -> 6183.62s]  What was that?
[6183.62s -> 6184.58s]  Very exorbitantly.
[6187.20s -> 6188.32s]  I'd pay extra.
[6189.44s -> 6190.88s]  Number three, I'm so sorry.
[6190.88s -> 6192.08s]  There's nothing I could do.
[6192.08s -> 6193.20s]  Yeah, thank you, number three.
[6193.20s -> 6195.12s]  I appreciate your heightened performance.
[6196.00s -> 6197.88s]  Thank you so much for the chance.
[6197.88s -> 6199.32s]  Thank you so much, number three.
[6199.96s -> 6201.16s]  That's actually phenomenal.
[6201.96s -> 6203.32s]  A very good try.
[6203.32s -> 6206.28s]  It would have been fun to see him hold something out of reach from you,
[6206.28s -> 6207.32s]  and then you jump at it.
[6208.20s -> 6209.76s]  I'm gonna press your X.
[6209.76s -> 6210.48s]  Okay, sorry.
[6210.48s -> 6210.88s]  I'm sorry.
[6210.88s -> 6211.60s]  That was just an idea.
[6211.60s -> 6212.08s]  I was...
[6212.08s -> 6213.68s]  Let's go ahead and send it to the next one, please.
[6213.68s -> 6214.64s]  Who's up on tap here?
[6214.64s -> 6216.24s]  It should be number, I believe, number...
[6217.92s -> 6219.28s]  Doctor, if it's clear, your X, please.
[6220.96s -> 6221.52s]  Number four.
[6222.80s -> 6223.04s]  Hey.
[6223.68s -> 6224.16s]  Okay.
[6224.16s -> 6224.80s]  Hi, number four.
[6224.80s -> 6225.28s]  How are you?
[6225.28s -> 6226.00s]  I'm doing good, you?
[6226.56s -> 6227.20s]  How are you?
[6227.20s -> 6228.00s]  I'm great, yeah.
[6228.00s -> 6229.84s]  You were kind of a weird guy in the first round.
[6230.72s -> 6231.60s]  Thanks for wanting to know one, huh?
[6232.24s -> 6232.96s]  Yeah, it does.
[6232.96s -> 6234.24s]  So true, so true.
[6234.24s -> 6234.96s]  Thank you, thank you.
[6234.96s -> 6235.36s]  So true.
[6235.36s -> 6236.08s]  Number four, what are you gonna do?
[6236.08s -> 6236.96s]  I like this guy.
[6236.96s -> 6238.00s]  Hey, how's it going?
[6238.00s -> 6238.40s]  Good, it's good.
[6238.40s -> 6239.60s]  What are you doing for us today?
[6239.60s -> 6241.36s]  I'm gonna do a little cat dog.
[6241.36s -> 6241.84s]  Cat dog?
[6241.84s -> 6242.56s]  Yeah, cat dog.
[6242.56s -> 6243.28s]  Like the show?
[6244.40s -> 6245.12s]  It's not like the show.
[6245.12s -> 6246.08s]  It's just cat dog.
[6246.08s -> 6246.56s]  Cat dog?
[6246.56s -> 6247.60s]  I'll take it at face value.
[6247.60s -> 6248.32s]  I'll take it at face value.
[6248.32s -> 6249.12s]  Take it at face value.
[6249.20s -> 6250.32s]  Just love it, enjoy it, yeah.
[6250.32s -> 6250.64s]  Great.
[6250.64s -> 6251.12s]  It'll be great.
[6251.12s -> 6252.48s]  Okay, number four, what are you doing?
[6252.48s -> 6253.12s]  I love cat dog.
[6253.12s -> 6253.92s]  You want me to...
[6253.92s -> 6254.88s]  He's doing cat dog.
[6254.88s -> 6255.44s]  I don't know what that means.
[6255.44s -> 6257.68s]  Can you give an artist the stage for once?
[6257.68s -> 6258.64s]  Well, what is cat dog?
[6259.68s -> 6262.48s]  You go live and you say we're playing Blumplkin 3 today
[6262.48s -> 6263.60s]  and no one questions that.
[6263.60s -> 6265.28s]  So, you know, just give him a shot.
[6265.28s -> 6265.68s]  That's true.
[6265.68s -> 6266.56s]  We're playing cat dog.
[6266.56s -> 6267.44s]  Number four, you have the floor.
[6267.44s -> 6269.20s]  Blumplkin 3, but cat dog.
[6269.20s -> 6269.76s]  Yeah, go ahead.
[6290.16s -> 6292.32s]  Don't clap.
[6296.32s -> 6297.04s]  He's a bad dog.
[6309.72s -> 6312.04s]  Absolutely fantastic performance.
[6312.04s -> 6313.32s]  I think the best we've seen all night.
[6313.32s -> 6315.16s]  We can all agree that was great.
[6315.16s -> 6316.04s]  I don't think so.
[6316.04s -> 6320.44s]  Well, I have the feeling that he suffers from dermatitis,
[6320.52s -> 6325.94s]  but having that said, I'm good.
[6328.18s -> 6329.46s]  Am I the only X here?
[6329.46s -> 6331.22s]  Do you get dermatitis from eating ass?
[6332.60s -> 6333.08s]  What's that?
[6333.08s -> 6334.60s]  Sorry, what was that?
[6334.60s -> 6335.96s]  No, just from eating X.
[6335.96s -> 6336.44s]  That's what he...
[6336.44s -> 6337.40s]  From eating ass?
[6337.40s -> 6340.12s]  Yeah, you're speaking about the posterior.
[6342.44s -> 6343.88s]  Do we have a two, V2 here?
[6344.76s -> 6346.44s]  You know, the ass talk pulled me out.
[6346.44s -> 6348.36s]  Can you make some more barking noises, please?
[6348.36s -> 6350.68s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6350.68s -> 6352.36s]  Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
[6352.76s -> 6353.72s]  Do we have a two, V2 here?
[6353.72s -> 6354.60s]  No, I pulled it back.
[6354.60s -> 6358.44s]  It's just you, I think, that do not enjoy this.
[6358.44s -> 6359.16s]  I'm not sure about that.
[6359.16s -> 6362.20s]  But an old, aging German wouldn't know the new one if it...
[6362.20s -> 6364.20s]  I mean, the cat and the dog thing, it was kind of weird.
[6364.20s -> 6365.88s]  Like, I don't know why you have cats and dogs and shit.
[6365.88s -> 6367.72s]  Like, he was weird in the first phase.
[6367.72s -> 6369.92s]  And you didn't like the other guy for the tail.
[6369.92s -> 6371.76s]  Well, he said he was a wolf.
[6371.76s -> 6372.80s]  Like, what about Otto?
[6372.80s -> 6373.92s]  Think about Otto, man.
[6373.92s -> 6375.28s]  Get your hands off me.
[6375.28s -> 6376.64s]  Can I ask you a question?
[6376.64s -> 6377.20s]  Sure.
[6377.20s -> 6381.68s]  What do you think about, like, a stream where you pretend to fight yourself?
[6382.08s -> 6384.64s]  Like a psychopath?
[6385.60s -> 6386.56s]  I'm not a psycho.
[6386.56s -> 6387.12s]  No, I'm just...
[6387.12s -> 6387.60s]  Cool.
[6387.60s -> 6388.88s]  Isn't that a cool stream idea?
[6388.88s -> 6390.64s]  I mean, it's a cool idea, but I don't know.
[6390.64s -> 6393.28s]  So then, like, this is like fighting yourself as an animal.
[6393.28s -> 6395.30s]  He's a little too weird for me.
[6395.30s -> 6396.66s]  I think that's why we like him.
[6396.66s -> 6397.30s]  Yeah.
[6397.30s -> 6399.96s]  We're all in agreement, gentlemen.
[6400.92s -> 6402.36s]  Am I getting vetoed out here?
[6402.36s -> 6403.80s]  It's three to one.
[6403.80s -> 6407.97s]  I'm sensing that in general, you're not ready to let go.
[6407.97s -> 6408.93s]  Times change, man.
[6408.93s -> 6410.21s]  Number four, congratulations.
[6410.21s -> 6411.25s]  You move on to the next round.
[6411.97s -> 6414.61s]  Congratulations.
[6414.61s -> 6415.89s]  Right on, man.
[6416.05s -> 6416.93s]  I love that guy.
[6416.93s -> 6419.17s]  On, on, my boys, unfortunately.
[6419.17s -> 6421.33s]  But we'll sit on the next contestant, please, if we get a chance.
[6429.78s -> 6431.14s]  Number five, how are you?
[6431.14s -> 6431.94s]  Good, good, good.
[6431.94s -> 6432.90s]  How are you?
[6432.90s -> 6434.10s]  I'm doing fantastic.
[6434.10s -> 6434.82s]  We're doing well.
[6435.62s -> 6436.90s]  Welcome to the stream, of course.
[6436.90s -> 6438.82s]  Welcome again for the second time.
[6439.70s -> 6440.58s]  I see a guitar.
[6440.58s -> 6441.54s]  What's that mean here?
[6441.54s -> 6446.26s]  Well, they handed it to me backstage and said that if I don't play it,
[6446.26s -> 6451.46s]  then I can't get any coffee, Cheetos, or chicken, which I was promised here.
[6451.46s -> 6454.26s]  Okay, that's a good callback, I think.
[6454.26s -> 6455.06s]  That's a pretty good callback.
[6457.06s -> 6457.86s]  What are you going to do for us?
[6458.98s -> 6462.90s]  Supposedly, I'm going to be playing a song that my mother wrote for me.
[6462.90s -> 6463.62s]  Your mother, okay.
[6463.62s -> 6467.86s]  Yeah, it was the hardest song I've ever had to learn in my entire life.
[6468.90s -> 6469.62s]  Let's go ahead and hear it.
[6473.30s -> 6475.46s]  All right, electric guitar, holy smokes.
[6491.75s -> 6509.99s]  I just want some coffee and Cheetos and chicken.
[6518.16s -> 6518.80s]  Number five.
[6520.72s -> 6524.00s]  Number five, before you get off stage, I just want to say,
[6524.96s -> 6528.16s]  it looks like every judge has said no, emphatically.
[6530.72s -> 6531.84s]  Absolutely rubbish.
[6532.40s -> 6533.52s]  Don't do this, stupid.
[6535.76s -> 6536.64s]  That's a different show.
[6537.52s -> 6541.41s]  Number five, we really think that eventually going forward here,
[6541.41s -> 6545.49s]  that you could probably do more with, you know, maybe eventually.
[6545.49s -> 6547.25s]  I think there's a reason she didn't love you.
[6551.78s -> 6553.06s]  Someone needs to tell him.
[6554.61s -> 6561.49s]  Well, I just have to say this, that I would like to see you improve your talent,
[6561.49s -> 6563.89s]  where I do appreciate that.
[6563.89s -> 6567.01s]  And we've all been through things where, you know,
[6567.73s -> 6570.69s]  your heart expands as much as it can.
[6572.77s -> 6573.49s]  Oh, excuse me.
[6573.49s -> 6574.45s]  Yeah, maybe next year.
[6576.61s -> 6577.49s]  Maybe next term.
[6577.49s -> 6578.45s]  I'm so sorry.
[6580.96s -> 6582.48s]  I mean, it's really emotional.
[6582.48s -> 6584.00s]  I can't do this.
[6584.64s -> 6587.36s]  Mark, I think you have talent.
[6587.36s -> 6590.96s]  You have what it takes, but maybe not with this exact setting,
[6590.96s -> 6592.32s]  but you are so smart.
[6592.32s -> 6593.04s]  You're so good.
[6593.04s -> 6593.92s]  You're so talented.
[6595.60s -> 6597.92s]  Well, everyone should cry during the segment.
[6597.92s -> 6599.28s]  I'm always upset.
[6599.28s -> 6600.96s]  Everybody needs to cry during the segment.
[6600.96s -> 6602.40s]  You shouldn't encourage him.
[6603.52s -> 6604.80s]  I would pick up a new hobby.
[6606.72s -> 6608.96s]  No, you have to really cry otherwise they won't believe it.
[6610.56s -> 6612.00s]  Really pick one up that's new.
[6612.96s -> 6614.16s]  Everybody needs to cry.
[6614.16s -> 6614.80s]  You can do it.
[6614.80s -> 6615.44s]  You can do it.
[6616.96s -> 6617.68s]  Thank you so much.
[6617.68s -> 6618.40s]  You were five.
[6618.40s -> 6621.52s]  You're so, you're such a fucking angel.
[6624.71s -> 6625.19s]  Thank you.
[6625.19s -> 6625.69s]  Cheetos.
[6627.19s -> 6628.71s]  He had one of three.
[6628.71s -> 6632.37s]  I don't know why.
[6632.37s -> 6633.73s]  Number six, please come out, please.
[6636.24s -> 6638.40s]  Oh, number six, we have a little bit of a thing for number six.
[6638.40s -> 6639.28s]  Oh, yeah.
[6639.28s -> 6642.08s]  Oh, so number six, we have a small package for number six.
[6642.08s -> 6642.64s]  I see.
[6642.64s -> 6643.12s]  Just to see.
[6643.12s -> 6643.76s]  Small package.
[6644.32s -> 6644.96s]  Already German.
[6647.12s -> 6647.62s]  Wow.
[6648.16s -> 6649.60s]  Talk to Dr. Swanson earlier, so.
[6651.28s -> 6653.19s]  God damn it.
[6655.11s -> 6659.41s]  Last 10 years, I've been listing this candy store in my town.
[6660.13s -> 6663.65s]  It's a small beach town that leads right into the Atlantic Ocean
[6663.65s -> 6666.61s]  and has the oldest boardwalk in all of America.
[6666.61s -> 6672.93s]  My father opened this candy shop in 1956 and he built it into the place that it is today.
[6673.73s -> 6678.02s]  Sadly, he passed away in 2012.
[6678.74s -> 6683.09s]  And since then, I took over the helm of the candy shop.
[6683.89s -> 6689.73s]  I'm actually such a large Germa fan that I named our specially chocolate fudge after him
[6689.73s -> 6691.17s]  to Jolly Germa.
[6691.17s -> 6694.37s]  Sadly, it's one of our least popular items.
[6695.99s -> 6699.43s]  The one major issue with running a shop in beach town is that
[6699.43s -> 6702.95s]  basically all of my business comes during the summer.
[6702.95s -> 6707.91s]  That means that nine months out of the year, I have almost nothing to do.
[6707.91s -> 6712.31s]  Hearing that Germa's retiring, I believe this would be the perfect job for me to spend
[6712.31s -> 6713.83s]  the rest of my time during.
[6713.83s -> 6719.51s]  Let's go.
[6719.51s -> 6720.47s]  Let's go ahead and bring them out.
[6721.19s -> 6723.94s]  What an interesting story that was.
[6723.94s -> 6724.98s]  You got a number six.
[6725.54s -> 6726.10s]  Number six.
[6728.21s -> 6729.57s]  What an interesting story.
[6729.57s -> 6730.29s]  Number six.
[6731.84s -> 6732.32s]  Hello.
[6732.32s -> 6733.12s]  How are you?
[6733.12s -> 6733.52s]  How are you doing?
[6733.52s -> 6733.92s]  Number six.
[6733.92s -> 6734.40s]  How are you?
[6734.40s -> 6734.96s]  I'm excellent.
[6734.96s -> 6736.00s]  How are you doing today?
[6736.00s -> 6736.88s]  Fantastically.
[6736.88s -> 6737.36s]  How are you?
[6737.92s -> 6738.80s]  I'm wonderful.
[6739.36s -> 6739.68s]  I'm good.
[6739.68s -> 6740.16s]  How are you?
[6740.96s -> 6742.72s]  I guess we're going to go through this a few times.
[6742.72s -> 6743.36s]  Yes.
[6743.60s -> 6744.64s]  Can I chime in?
[6744.64s -> 6745.76s]  I'm wondering how you're doing today.
[6747.76s -> 6748.88s]  Beyond mediocre.
[6748.88s -> 6749.20s]  Great.
[6749.20s -> 6749.76s]  Okay.
[6749.76s -> 6751.20s]  What are you doing for us today?
[6751.20s -> 6754.24s]  Today, I will be doing a Yoda impersonation.
[6754.24s -> 6754.56s]  Oh.
[6754.56s -> 6755.12s]  Yoda.
[6755.12s -> 6756.00s]  I love that.
[6756.00s -> 6757.20s]  From the Star Wars.
[6757.20s -> 6758.16s]  From the Star Wars.
[6758.16s -> 6758.72s]  All right.
[6758.72s -> 6759.04s]  All right.
[6759.04s -> 6759.60s]  Excellent.
[6759.60s -> 6760.96s]  What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
[6760.96s -> 6761.20s]  Sorry.
[6761.20s -> 6762.48s]  What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
[6763.20s -> 6764.56s]  Has to be Empire Strikes Back.
[6764.56s -> 6764.88s]  Okay.
[6765.44s -> 6766.16s]  Okay.
[6766.16s -> 6767.68s]  I only watch the prequels, but that's fun.
[6767.68s -> 6768.16s]  That's fun.
[6769.12s -> 6770.48s]  It is where Yoda showed up.
[6771.20s -> 6772.64s]  So you take a moment.
[6773.28s -> 6774.08s]  You're going to do Yoda?
[6774.08s -> 6775.60s]  To get into character.
[6775.60s -> 6776.00s]  Oh.
[6776.00s -> 6776.64s]  Okay.
[6776.64s -> 6776.88s]  Sure.
[6777.44s -> 6777.76s]  Huh.
[6786.37s -> 6790.69s]  German ass to you.
[6791.57s -> 6792.95s]  You called it.
[6792.95s -> 6793.99s]  It was so good.
[6793.99s -> 6794.95s]  It was so good.
[6794.95s -> 6795.83s]  I didn't expect that.
[6795.83s -> 6797.11s]  Which one did you have from?
[6797.11s -> 6798.63s]  Yoda speaks in backward sentences,
[6798.63s -> 6799.11s]  so I was like,
[6799.11s -> 6800.47s]  why would a disappointing start to a sentence?
[6800.47s -> 6800.71s]  Hold on.
[6800.71s -> 6801.19s]  Let him go.
[6801.19s -> 6801.67s]  Let him go.
[6801.67s -> 6802.87s]  Question pending is.
[6803.43s -> 6804.07s]  Question for me.
[6804.87s -> 6806.15s]  It ass to you.
[6808.88s -> 6809.44s]  They love it.
[6810.00s -> 6810.48s]  They love it.
[6810.48s -> 6810.96s]  You're not answering.
[6810.96s -> 6812.24s]  You're going to have to tell the people.
[6812.88s -> 6814.00s]  Uh, uh, okay.
[6816.98s -> 6817.86s]  Follow-up question.
[6817.86s -> 6819.86s]  Do I have a follow-up?
[6819.86s -> 6820.18s]  Okay.
[6820.18s -> 6821.54s]  What's your follow-up pressure?
[6821.54s -> 6822.98s]  Your own ass.
[6822.98s -> 6824.10s]  Do you eat?
[6824.10s -> 6825.06s]  Can I press yours here?
[6826.10s -> 6827.54s]  I've had enough of this.
[6827.54s -> 6828.50s]  No, I'm enjoying this.
[6828.50s -> 6829.06s]  This is good.
[6829.06s -> 6829.30s]  Sure.
[6829.30s -> 6830.18s]  Do you hear the crowd?
[6830.18s -> 6831.46s]  The crowd loves him.
[6831.46s -> 6832.98s]  The crowd wants to see him.
[6832.98s -> 6833.70s]  Rule of threes.
[6833.70s -> 6834.42s]  Give him a third.
[6835.22s -> 6836.82s]  Give us another.
[6836.82s -> 6837.70s]  German.
[6837.70s -> 6837.94s]  Yeah.
[6839.30s -> 6840.74s]  What height claim you to be?
[6841.46s -> 6842.26s]  Five eight with shoes.
[6843.89s -> 6845.49s]  Five eight with dress shoes.
[6845.49s -> 6846.69s]  Just like everybody else here.
[6847.41s -> 6849.73s]  Because it gives you an extra oomph.
[6849.73s -> 6850.85s]  What are you without shoes?
[6850.85s -> 6851.33s]  Five seven.
[6851.33s -> 6852.37s]  You might not just say five seven.
[6852.37s -> 6852.85s]  Because that's.
[6853.81s -> 6855.01s]  Don't do that one.
[6855.01s -> 6855.97s]  Play that one back.
[6855.97s -> 6856.85s]  Oh man.
[6856.85s -> 6858.29s]  Five eight you claim to be?
[6858.29s -> 6859.73s]  Five eight with dress shoes.
[6859.73s -> 6860.61s]  Full of shit you are.
[6861.41s -> 6862.68s]  I want more.
[6862.68s -> 6863.48s]  I want more nos.
[6864.04s -> 6865.24s]  From the original Saga.
[6865.24s -> 6865.48s]  Right?
[6865.48s -> 6865.96s]  That line?
[6865.96s -> 6866.12s]  Yeah.
[6866.12s -> 6866.60s]  All right.
[6866.60s -> 6867.56s]  I'm just going to re-joke with that.
[6867.56s -> 6870.12s]  Can we please keep our hands to ourselves?
[6870.12s -> 6871.40s]  I'm going to press that one for Ludwig
[6871.40s -> 6873.08s]  because I don't think he should press yes.
[6873.08s -> 6873.48s]  German.
[6875.04s -> 6876.16s]  Familiar do you look?
[6876.96s -> 6877.20s]  Yeah.
[6878.50s -> 6879.94s]  C.I.U.
[6881.00s -> 6882.20s]  In a Spider-Man movie.
[6886.24s -> 6887.12s]  A villain would you?
[6888.93s -> 6890.21s]  In three one.
[6890.21s -> 6892.13s]  Wait Willem Dafoe.
[6892.13s -> 6893.09s]  It's a Willem Dafoe reference.
[6893.09s -> 6893.89s]  A Willem Dafoe reference.
[6893.89s -> 6894.53s]  Okay it's a Willem.
[6894.53s -> 6894.85s]  Okay.
[6894.85s -> 6896.61s]  I got it but C.I.U. in.
[6897.49s -> 6899.41s]  I'm a connoisseur of memes myself.
[6899.41s -> 6899.65s]  Yeah.
[6900.53s -> 6901.73s]  I mean what do we got here?
[6901.73s -> 6902.85s]  We got three.
[6902.85s -> 6903.01s]  Yeah.
[6903.01s -> 6903.73s]  Is anybody?
[6903.73s -> 6904.37s]  Schmoyxen.
[6904.37s -> 6906.69s]  Schmoyxen do you want to try to switch us or?
[6907.89s -> 6908.77s]  Let's see.
[6908.85s -> 6910.13s]  Perhaps a song we could sing.
[6910.85s -> 6913.49s]  I just I just want to know one thing.
[6913.49s -> 6915.41s]  Are the ears dry cleanable?
[6917.20s -> 6919.20s]  I regularly swab them.
[6920.00s -> 6920.96s]  That was forward.
[6920.96s -> 6921.68s]  It was forward.
[6921.68s -> 6922.24s]  Oh shit.
[6922.24s -> 6923.68s]  He didn't flip it.
[6923.68s -> 6924.40s]  Let me swab.
[6924.40s -> 6925.84s]  That was not Yoda.
[6925.84s -> 6927.20s]  That was not Yoda bra-
[6927.20s -> 6928.56s]  That was not Yoda based.
[6928.56s -> 6932.96s]  That was out of character for what Yoda's speech patterns are.
[6932.96s -> 6934.24s]  To the human was I speaking.
[6936.48s -> 6937.52s]  We got three.
[6937.52s -> 6938.24s]  Previously.
[6938.24s -> 6939.04s]  Number six.
[6939.04s -> 6939.92s]  I'm so sorry.
[6940.98s -> 6942.58s]  Good luck on the candy store.
[6942.58s -> 6943.38s]  I heard it.
[6943.38s -> 6944.26s]  I hope it goes well.
[6944.98s -> 6945.62s]  How dare you.
[6946.90s -> 6947.70s]  Again that's not.
[6952.40s -> 6953.60s]  Not too late for me to-
[6953.60s -> 6955.04s]  Oh I'm gone.
[6955.04s -> 6956.08s]  Is it time for me to stay please?
[6956.08s -> 6956.80s]  Number six.
[6956.80s -> 6957.84s]  Thank you so much.
[6957.84s -> 6958.80s]  That was unbelievable.
[6958.80s -> 6959.28s]  Goodbye.
[6959.28s -> 6959.52s]  Thank you.
[6959.52s -> 6961.44s]  It's about way too dank.
[6962.48s -> 6963.12s]  I guess maybe-
[6963.12s -> 6963.68s]  Are clapping?
[6963.68s -> 6964.16s]  Is it loud?
[6965.04s -> 6966.64s]  No I think it was a second before.
[6966.64s -> 6967.52s]  Oh a second before.
[6968.56s -> 6969.12s]  Unfortunately number six is-
[6969.12s -> 6970.16s]  Can you do your Yoda?
[6970.16s -> 6970.96s]  Do you have one?
[6970.96s -> 6971.76s]  I could probably do a Yoda.
[6971.76s -> 6972.16s]  Let me try.
[6979.84s -> 6980.40s]  Is that bad?
[6981.36s -> 6983.68s]  It really was one word elongated.
[6986.48s -> 6987.84s]  You sound like the sweetest chef.
[6989.52s -> 6991.04s]  I believe I heard a yodel.
[6992.40s -> 6993.20s]  Wait hold on.
[6994.00s -> 6994.88s]  Am I little-
[6994.88s -> 6995.44s]  I must-
[6996.32s -> 6998.48s]  We must go to the store.
[6998.48s -> 6999.04s]  What did he say?
[6999.44s -> 7001.12s]  Not that.
[7001.12s -> 7001.92s]  He doesn't say let's go to the store.
[7001.92s -> 7003.20s]  Maybe he was the next Jerma.
[7003.20s -> 7004.16s]  You both can't do it.
[7004.72s -> 7005.44s]  Wait hold on.
[7006.64s -> 7009.76s]  Yes we must learn you the force we will.
[7009.76s -> 7010.24s]  That was good.
[7010.80s -> 7011.92s]  Don't tell us it's good.
[7011.92s -> 7013.60s]  I feel like we are the judges.
[7013.60s -> 7014.88s]  Do you think it was good doctor?
[7014.88s -> 7016.16s]  We are-
[7016.16s -> 7017.04s]  Tony you can't X me.
[7017.04s -> 7017.92s]  You're over there.
[7017.92s -> 7018.88s]  One two three.
[7018.88s -> 7019.52s]  Judges.
[7019.52s -> 7020.08s]  Uh huh.
[7020.08s -> 7020.80s]  Okay who's-
[7020.80s -> 7021.52s]  I think it was all right.
[7022.32s -> 7023.76s]  All right we need to clear the X's.
[7023.76s -> 7024.16s]  Clear.
[7024.16s -> 7024.88s]  We were Xing you.
[7027.97s -> 7028.69s]  Oh are you?
[7028.69s -> 7030.29s]  Why do you have to go like this when you do Yoda?
[7031.25s -> 7031.89s]  You don't.
[7031.89s -> 7034.21s]  I think that's what you're doing that makes it bad.
[7034.21s -> 7034.85s]  Is that my fault?
[7035.49s -> 7037.65s]  You're doing a chicken that is walking.
[7037.65s -> 7039.57s]  I got a phone here and I'm ready to call somebody.
[7039.57s -> 7040.13s]  Okay.
[7040.13s -> 7041.09s]  Okay I-
[7041.09s -> 7041.89s]  Is that a threat?
[7043.49s -> 7044.05s]  Hello Mr. President.
[7044.05s -> 7045.01s]  I loved your Yoda.
[7046.05s -> 7046.61s]  That helps.
[7046.61s -> 7047.97s]  Your Yoda was fantastic.
[7047.97s -> 7049.81s]  Oh he's on the phone again guys.
[7051.24s -> 7054.58s]  Oh my god okay so we've got a-
[7054.58s -> 7057.38s]  I think there's a piano player coming up here.
[7057.38s -> 7059.54s]  If they take a second longer to get set up
[7059.54s -> 7061.46s]  which is not their responsibility I'm buzzing.
[7061.86s -> 7065.51s]  Okay I think we're ready to bring in the next person.
[7066.47s -> 7069.52s]  Number eight how are you?
[7069.52s -> 7070.88s]  I'm good how are you all?
[7070.88s -> 7072.40s]  Very good very good very good.
[7072.40s -> 7073.44s]  Awesome.
[7073.44s -> 7074.88s]  What are you doing here?
[7074.88s -> 7076.72s]  Well I'm a big musical theater fan.
[7076.72s -> 7077.20s]  Okay.
[7077.20s -> 7079.92s]  So I know you've all heard maybe like Cats the Musical
[7079.92s -> 7083.52s]  but you know I'm just really inspired by you in German if I'm being honest.
[7083.52s -> 7086.56s]  And I made a mini musical.
[7086.56s -> 7089.84s]  It's Rats the mini stage reading.
[7089.84s -> 7092.88s]  So I want to present it to you here hopefully so you can like pick it up
[7092.88s -> 7093.76s]  and you know like do something with it.
[7093.76s -> 7095.68s]  I really want to go to Broadway but like this is-
[7095.68s -> 7097.12s]  you're the first person to see this.
[7097.12s -> 7098.64s]  I put a lot of work into it so.
[7098.64s -> 7099.20s]  Okay.
[7099.20s -> 7099.68s]  Yeah.
[7099.68s -> 7101.12s]  This is- you wrote this?
[7101.12s -> 7104.80s]  Oh no it's totally Jerma's creation the Rats song.
[7104.80s -> 7105.92s]  You're bringing it to life.
[7107.04s -> 7108.00s]  I'm bringing it to life.
[7108.00s -> 7111.36s]  It's like he made Shrek and you're doing Shrek the musical theater adaption.
[7111.36s -> 7115.36s]  Absolutely I have a little choreographed dance to the song.
[7115.36s -> 7121.12s]  I have a dramatic stage reading and then yeah an improv jazz piano performance.
[7121.12s -> 7121.60s]  Okay.
[7121.60s -> 7123.52s]  I'm really hoping you'll enjoy it.
[7123.60s -> 7126.32s]  Kind of like you have before take with it and then we'll see how it goes.
[7126.32s -> 7126.56s]  Yeah.
[7126.56s -> 7127.04s]  Absolutely.
[7127.04s -> 7127.60s]  You gotta get away.
[7127.60s -> 7128.32s]  You have the floor.
[7128.32s -> 7128.72s]  Awesome.
[7128.72s -> 7130.40s]  All right then we'll put this here and we'll start with the dance.
[7130.40s -> 7131.36s]  Yeah go for it.
[7131.36s -> 7132.40s]  You wrote a musical?
[7132.96s -> 7135.68s]  No but I made a video with 3D move maker and it sucked.
[7136.72s -> 7138.08s]  People on TikTok thought it was funny.
[7138.80s -> 7139.89s]  That's all that really matters.
[7139.89s -> 7141.33s]  I'm huge on TikTok by the way.
[7141.33s -> 7141.89s]  Okay.
[7141.89s -> 7142.77s]  I checked it's not.
[7143.49s -> 7144.05s]  I mean I am.
[7154.05s -> 7156.85s]  That makes all of them fools.
[7156.85s -> 7160.85s]  Let's see what kind of troll we get ourselves into.
[7172.85s -> 7173.89s]  Oh yes.
[7173.89s -> 7176.13s]  It's gonna be great on TikTok.
[7176.13s -> 7177.57s]  That was amazing.
[7177.57s -> 7178.29s]  I don't believe it.
[7178.29s -> 7179.25s]  Part one!
[7179.25s -> 7180.05s]  I don't believe it.
[7180.61s -> 7181.33s]  I don't believe it.
[7187.88s -> 7189.64s]  Dramatic reading of The Rats.
[7190.44s -> 7190.60s]  Okay.
[7190.60s -> 7191.56s]  As done by Jerma.
[7192.28s -> 7194.60s]  Impersonating Wanda Bo.
[7198.10s -> 7198.66s]  Rats.
[7199.70s -> 7200.90s]  We're rats.
[7201.46s -> 7204.34s]  We're the rats.
[7205.57s -> 7207.49s]  We pray at night.
[7208.13s -> 7210.61s]  We stalk at night.
[7211.49s -> 7213.57s]  We're the rats.
[7216.26s -> 7221.46s]  I'm the giant rat that makes all of the room.
[7221.46s -> 7222.90s]  Let's see what kind of trouble.
[7226.48s -> 7226.80s]  Rats.
[7227.76s -> 7228.16s]  Rats.
[7228.96s -> 7230.92s]  We're the rats.
[7233.52s -> 7233.92s]  Peter.
[7235.83s -> 7237.27s]  It's your birthday today.
[7237.27s -> 7240.96s]  Ice cream is on it's way.
[7242.61s -> 7243.11s]  Peter.
[7244.44s -> 7246.76s]  You've been such a good boy this year.
[7248.92s -> 7251.38s]  Chris is.
[7252.50s -> 7253.38s]  And then we'll cheer.
[7259.44s -> 7261.76s]  There's another part to this apparently.
[7261.76s -> 7262.48s]  The third act.
[7262.48s -> 7263.44s]  The third act.
[7263.44s -> 7263.92s]  Buckle in.
[7264.64s -> 7266.24s]  He's gonna play something on the keyboard.
[7269.81s -> 7270.31s]  Check.
[7275.49s -> 7276.21s]  How are we looking?
[7276.85s -> 7277.35s]  Okay.
[7281.09s -> 7281.81s]  Test the tune out.
[7281.81s -> 7282.77s]  Make sure the tune is okay.
[7283.41s -> 7284.05s]  Yeah.
[7284.05s -> 7284.53s]  Check, check.
[7284.53s -> 7285.25s]  All right.
[7285.25s -> 7285.75s]  Okay.
[7286.29s -> 7294.95s]  That is...
[7294.95s -> 7295.27s]  Yeah.
[7295.27s -> 7295.99s]  I have no idea.
[7296.55s -> 7297.78s]  A connoisseur.
[7297.78s -> 7298.42s]  True connoisseur.
[7298.42s -> 7298.92s]  Mm-hmm.
[7302.56s -> 7304.56s]  Rats.
[7305.68s -> 7308.32s]  We're rats.
[7308.32s -> 7308.88s]  Damn.
[7308.88s -> 7314.77s]  We're the rats.
[7314.77s -> 7315.27s]  Stalk.
[7317.46s -> 7319.78s]  In the night.
[7319.78s -> 7324.90s]  We pray at night.
[7324.90s -> 7325.86s]  Yeah, yeah.
[7327.88s -> 7330.28s]  We're rats.
[7330.28s -> 7331.59s]  Not done yet.
[7331.59s -> 7332.88s]  Hold your applause.
[7332.88s -> 7333.36s]  Thank you.
[7334.08s -> 7335.28s]  I was about to clap.
[7335.28s -> 7336.00s]  I was getting there.
[7346.48s -> 7350.32s]  I'm the giant rat.
[7350.32s -> 7356.87s]  That makes all the rats.
[7365.35s -> 7366.15s]  What?
[7366.15s -> 7366.87s]  I'll explain after.
[7377.56s -> 7379.72s]  You would have buzzed him by now if he wasn't so good at it.
[7379.72s -> 7381.56s]  But this is painful for you.
[7383.72s -> 7384.52s]  That's good enough.
[7384.52s -> 7385.02s]  All right.
[7385.02s -> 7388.06s]  Ice cream is on its way.
[7390.86s -> 7393.82s]  Germa, Germa, Germa.
[7393.82s -> 7395.18s]  My goodness gracious.
[7395.18s -> 7406.30s]  Open up your presents and we'll have some cheese here.
[7406.30s -> 7407.90s]  Happy birthday.
[7407.90s -> 7409.66s]  It's nobody's birthday, but I'll take it.
[7409.66s -> 7410.54s]  It's all right.
[7410.54s -> 7411.18s]  It's your birthday.
[7411.18s -> 7411.90s]  Happy birthday.
[7411.90s -> 7413.18s]  I'm 37 this year.
[7413.18s -> 7413.82s]  37.
[7413.82s -> 7414.38s]  Wow.
[7414.38s -> 7415.26s]  All right.
[7415.26s -> 7415.74s]  Thank you.
[7415.74s -> 7416.38s]  All right.
[7417.83s -> 7418.39s]  Thank you.
[7418.39s -> 7419.35s]  Thank you so much.
[7420.39s -> 7421.35s]  That was really exciting for me.
[7421.35s -> 7424.55s]  That was phenomenal.
[7424.55s -> 7424.95s]  Number eight.
[7424.95s -> 7428.07s]  We have one X from Ludwig and I'm very curious why.
[7428.07s -> 7429.75s]  Yeah, I want to talk to you directly.
[7429.75s -> 7430.71s]  Of course.
[7430.71s -> 7431.75s]  You're selling yourself short.
[7432.71s -> 7436.31s]  I'm thinking you Kanye West, Lady Gaga.
[7436.31s -> 7437.99s]  OK, Steve Jobs.
[7439.03s -> 7442.23s]  You're doing things that Germa dreams of at night.
[7442.23s -> 7442.55s]  Right.
[7442.55s -> 7445.11s]  He falls asleep wishing he could sing and dance like that.
[7445.19s -> 7446.47s]  You don't know how much that means to me.
[7446.47s -> 7447.43s]  Like it's been years.
[7447.99s -> 7449.99s]  You know, just like trying and trying and trying.
[7451.43s -> 7453.03s]  This might be my big break.
[7453.03s -> 7456.31s]  I want you to know this now is another door opening.
[7459.37s -> 7460.25s]  What about this now?
[7460.97s -> 7461.82s]  What's that?
[7461.82s -> 7462.70s]  What are you thinking?
[7462.70s -> 7463.98s]  I'm having a I'm having trouble.
[7464.70s -> 7465.82s]  Tell me what you're having trouble with.
[7465.82s -> 7466.78s]  Maybe we can work this out.
[7467.42s -> 7468.94s]  The keyboard is coming out.
[7468.94s -> 7470.46s]  It was a little too dragged out.
[7470.46s -> 7471.10s]  I was a little.
[7472.47s -> 7474.39s]  You're saying no to the voice of a generation.
[7474.39s -> 7474.87s]  Wait, wait.
[7475.35s -> 7476.71s]  I might be able to like work on that.
[7476.71s -> 7478.15s]  We have to take number eight.
[7478.15s -> 7478.55s]  I know.
[7478.55s -> 7478.79s]  I know.
[7478.79s -> 7479.91s]  But I'm having trouble.
[7481.03s -> 7482.31s]  I think I'm going to have to phone a friend.
[7483.58s -> 7484.14s]  Let's go ahead.
[7484.14s -> 7485.02s]  Let's go ahead and call.
[7485.02s -> 7485.50s]  Let's go out and get.
[7485.50s -> 7486.54s]  Can I phone a friend here?
[7486.54s -> 7487.42s]  Just get some advice here.
[7488.78s -> 7489.90s]  It's very tricky.
[7489.90s -> 7492.22s]  That keyboard was fantastic, but it was a little drowned.
[7492.22s -> 7493.18s]  It was a little drawn out.
[7494.81s -> 7496.41s]  Not like what's happening right now.
[7496.41s -> 7497.61s]  Can we can we?
[7497.61s -> 7498.81s]  You're great, darling.
[7498.81s -> 7499.45s]  I appreciate that.
[7499.45s -> 7500.81s]  Can we connect to Kit Boga, please?
[7504.54s -> 7505.74s]  I'm phoning a friend here.
[7505.74s -> 7506.46s]  Four, four, four.
[7507.10s -> 7508.70s]  I think we're a little split on this.
[7509.42s -> 7511.16s]  I don't know why you're flinging it.
[7511.98s -> 7513.42s]  Why would you be getting a ring if you're?
[7515.10s -> 7515.60s]  Hello?
[7516.54s -> 7517.42s]  Kit Boga, hi.
[7517.42s -> 7521.98s]  This is Jerma985 calling from through some cell service device.
[7521.98s -> 7523.58s]  I want to get your advice on something.
[7524.30s -> 7524.62s]  What?
[7525.42s -> 7527.50s]  Sorry, who is this?
[7527.50s -> 7529.10s]  It's Jerma985.
[7529.66s -> 7530.06s]  Jerma.
[7530.70s -> 7531.26s]  Oh, hey.
[7532.30s -> 7533.82s]  Are you watching the stream, Kit, right now?
[7534.54s -> 7539.03s]  Yeah, so I'm just trying to finish this 200 word essay.
[7539.03s -> 7541.19s]  So yeah.
[7541.99s -> 7543.59s]  OK, so I got a guy up here.
[7543.59s -> 7544.47s]  He's number eight.
[7544.47s -> 7545.67s]  He played the piano.
[7545.67s -> 7546.39s]  He's really funny.
[7546.39s -> 7547.27s]  He's really interesting.
[7549.03s -> 7554.31s]  I need some input on if you think that he could move on to the next round as the next Jerma.
[7554.31s -> 7555.75s]  Have you been paying attention to the stream at all?
[7556.71s -> 7559.59s]  I mean, it kind of depends.
[7559.59s -> 7561.43s]  You want my opinion or do you?
[7561.43s -> 7562.47s]  I need your opinion.
[7562.47s -> 7563.83s]  You're one of the two calls I can make.
[7563.91s -> 7566.71s]  There's one more person I can call, which you'll see very soon enough.
[7567.59s -> 7569.86s]  I'm not really that good under pressure.
[7570.50s -> 7572.02s]  Well, I need it now.
[7572.58s -> 7573.78s]  That guy clearly is, though.
[7574.42s -> 7575.62s]  Number eight, clearly.
[7575.62s -> 7576.34s]  Clearly is no.
[7578.62s -> 7581.18s]  So OK, OK.
[7581.18s -> 7581.74s]  I'll tell you what.
[7582.46s -> 7588.14s]  Whoever said money can't solve your problems must have not had enough money to solve them.
[7588.14s -> 7588.54s]  Right?
[7588.54s -> 7589.58s]  Ariana Grande.
[7589.58s -> 7590.30s]  What are you talking about?
[7592.38s -> 7593.18s]  Ariana Grande.
[7593.58s -> 7594.78s]  Yeah, well, what is that?
[7594.78s -> 7596.22s]  Did you like number eight or not?
[7596.22s -> 7597.34s]  Like, what does that have to do with Ariana Grande?
[7597.34s -> 7600.28s]  The point is she says, I want it.
[7600.28s -> 7600.84s]  I got it.
[7601.40s -> 7601.88s]  I want it.
[7601.88s -> 7602.52s]  I got it.
[7602.52s -> 7604.36s]  I feel like this is you.
[7604.92s -> 7605.16s]  Yeah.
[7605.16s -> 7605.96s]  What do you want?
[7607.16s -> 7610.52s]  I want my replacement kit and it's hard to do.
[7611.40s -> 7612.52s]  I love Ariana Grande.
[7614.44s -> 7616.12s]  OK, put him, pass him through.
[7616.12s -> 7616.68s]  Wait, what?
[7616.68s -> 7616.92s]  Yeah.
[7617.64s -> 7619.13s]  He loves Ariana Grande.
[7619.13s -> 7620.01s]  Put him through.
[7620.01s -> 7623.61s]  That's your criteria is if they like Ariana Grande, is pass him through.
[7624.41s -> 7624.97s]  He's really popular.
[7624.97s -> 7625.69s]  It's enough for me.
[7625.69s -> 7626.33s]  She's hot.
[7626.33s -> 7626.65s]  She's hot.
[7626.65s -> 7628.33s]  Hey, he's popping off.
[7628.33s -> 7630.01s]  Kit, thanks for absolutely nothing.
[7632.07s -> 7632.55s]  She's hot.
[7632.55s -> 7633.35s]  What a fucking crutch.
[7633.35s -> 7634.87s]  Don't spill that soda, sponsor.
[7637.91s -> 7638.79s]  I got some input.
[7641.43s -> 7641.91s]  Number eight.
[7643.64s -> 7644.20s]  Oh, yeah.
[7644.20s -> 7645.96s]  We have a yes from Dr. Schmikeson.
[7645.96s -> 7646.92s]  Is that what it is?
[7646.92s -> 7647.40s]  Yeah.
[7647.40s -> 7656.15s]  Well, all I have to say, you almost had me in tears, but I just have to say it's quite
[7656.95s -> 7659.69s]  uber-germaniac.
[7659.69s -> 7660.41s]  Definitely.
[7661.37s -> 7661.69s]  Thank you.
[7661.69s -> 7662.25s]  That means a lot.
[7664.39s -> 7664.87s]  Number eight.
[7665.51s -> 7667.26s]  I'm going to have to tell you.
[7667.82s -> 7670.34s]  Congratulations.
[7670.34s -> 7671.46s]  You've moved on to the next round.
[7672.50s -> 7673.14s]  You earned it.
[7674.44s -> 7675.16s]  Really good.
[7675.16s -> 7675.96s]  Really good stuff.
[7675.96s -> 7677.00s]  Thank you so much.
[7677.00s -> 7677.96s]  I really won't let you down.
[7677.96s -> 7678.76s]  This guy's the limit.
[7678.76s -> 7679.40s]  This is going places.
[7679.40s -> 7680.60s]  This guy's the limit.
[7680.60s -> 7681.16s]  Thank you.
[7681.16s -> 7681.56s]  Thank you.
[7681.56s -> 7682.04s]  Number eight.
[7682.04s -> 7683.56s]  You've moved on to the next round.
[7683.56s -> 7685.32s]  I just like him one bit, honestly.
[7685.32s -> 7686.20s]  Why did you say yes?
[7686.20s -> 7687.16s]  He couldn't take it.
[7687.16s -> 7687.80s]  You're an idiot.
[7688.84s -> 7689.32s]  You can tell.
[7689.32s -> 7690.44s]  Why would you vote yes?
[7690.44s -> 7693.64s]  He would shatter at any negativity.
[7693.64s -> 7694.44s]  Why would you say yes?
[7694.44s -> 7695.32s]  He's just like a germa.
[7696.04s -> 7697.56s]  I don't shatter at negativity.
[7697.56s -> 7698.44s]  Oh, that's a good-
[7698.44s -> 7699.32s]  That's why you passed him through.
[7699.32s -> 7700.68s]  Look where he's going right now.
[7700.68s -> 7703.00s]  I do not shatter at negativity.
[7703.00s -> 7704.04s]  No, I don't.
[7704.04s -> 7705.32s]  I take a lot of shit.
[7705.32s -> 7707.08s]  I feel like you're not listening to what Kit said.
[7707.96s -> 7709.32s]  He said Ariana Grande's.
[7710.04s -> 7711.08s]  He said no, then he said yes.
[7711.08s -> 7711.72s]  It was hard to tell.
[7712.44s -> 7712.76s]  I take-
[7712.76s -> 7713.48s]  You want it.
[7713.48s -> 7714.04s]  I got it.
[7717.69s -> 7718.81s]  Clear your boards, please.
[7718.81s -> 7719.69s]  We have the next person coming up.
[7719.69s -> 7720.73s]  We're cleared.
[7720.73s -> 7721.69s]  Where's my chapstick?
[7721.69s -> 7723.05s]  I'm fucking freaked the fuck out.
[7723.61s -> 7724.89s]  Negativity.
[7724.89s -> 7726.17s]  I've got some on my lips.
[7726.17s -> 7726.67s]  I know.
[7727.37s -> 7729.88s]  Excuse me.
[7730.92s -> 7731.32s]  All right.
[7731.32s -> 7732.76s]  Number nine is out here now.
[7732.76s -> 7733.96s]  Number nine, how are you?
[7733.96s -> 7735.00s]  Welcome to the screen.
[7735.00s -> 7735.64s]  Number nine.
[7738.07s -> 7738.63s]  It works.
[7738.63s -> 7739.75s]  Don't tap it, please.
[7739.75s -> 7740.31s]  Audio issues.
[7740.31s -> 7741.11s]  That's a good German one.
[7741.99s -> 7742.47s]  There we go.
[7742.47s -> 7742.97s]  Very good.
[7743.91s -> 7744.55s]  Hi.
[7744.55s -> 7745.59s]  Hi, number nine.
[7745.59s -> 7746.31s]  Hi.
[7746.31s -> 7747.11s]  How are you?
[7747.11s -> 7748.47s]  I am doing excellent.
[7748.47s -> 7749.27s]  Are you excited?
[7749.27s -> 7751.43s]  I am literally shaking right now.
[7751.43s -> 7753.19s]  You've moved this far, number nine.
[7753.83s -> 7756.07s]  We need a wow factor here.
[7756.07s -> 7756.57s]  Okay.
[7756.95s -> 7758.71s]  I'm going to bring it, you know,
[7759.19s -> 7762.63s]  I consider myself to be a dancer.
[7763.27s -> 7763.99s]  A dancer?
[7763.99s -> 7764.87s]  A dancer.
[7764.87s -> 7765.83s]  Something of a dancer myself.
[7765.83s -> 7766.33s]  A dancer.
[7767.11s -> 7767.75s]  It's a reference.
[7768.79s -> 7769.11s]  That's it.
[7769.11s -> 7769.91s]  That's it, Peter?
[7769.91s -> 7770.15s]  Yes.
[7770.15s -> 7770.79s]  That is it, Peter?
[7771.51s -> 7773.67s]  So you're going to do a dance routine or?
[7773.67s -> 7773.99s]  Yes.
[7773.99s -> 7776.79s]  I'm going to show you some break dancing here today.
[7777.51s -> 7780.23s]  I'm going to just use the entire area,
[7780.23s -> 7781.91s]  break it down for you guys a little bit,
[7781.91s -> 7782.71s]  show you my moves.
[7782.71s -> 7785.19s]  Are you aware the real German cannot break dance?
[7785.19s -> 7785.83s]  That's bullshit.
[7785.83s -> 7786.33s]  I can.
[7787.91s -> 7788.55s]  It's debatable.
[7789.99s -> 7792.07s]  I've been inspired by some of his work.
[7792.87s -> 7794.23s]  It looks like he's going to come up to stage
[7794.23s -> 7796.55s]  and he's actually going to preview it.
[7796.55s -> 7798.31s]  I don't know how I'm going to follow this up.
[7798.31s -> 7798.87s]  Get out of the way.
[7799.59s -> 7800.15s]  Get out of the way.
[7801.99s -> 7803.59s]  What did you, sir, sir, what did you say?
[7803.59s -> 7806.23s]  I said the real German cannot break dance.
[7806.23s -> 7806.79s]  Okay.
[7806.79s -> 7810.25s]  I think he can.
[7810.25s -> 7810.97s]  That wasn't me.
[7810.97s -> 7812.33s]  It was mostly the speed you went.
[7814.33s -> 7814.83s]  Wow.
[7815.45s -> 7821.53s]  I hope he didn't break something.
[7822.09s -> 7823.93s]  We all hope that you have better than that,
[7823.93s -> 7825.29s]  but I wish you luck.
[7825.29s -> 7827.61s]  I scraped, I scraped my fucking knee.
[7827.61s -> 7828.89s]  The next stream in three months.
[7832.06s -> 7832.62s]  Number nine.
[7832.62s -> 7833.58s]  Can you do better than that?
[7833.58s -> 7834.22s]  Let's find out.
[7834.22s -> 7834.94s]  Good luck.
[7834.94s -> 7838.79s]  Here we go.
[7838.79s -> 7839.67s]  Oh, yeah.
[7839.67s -> 7840.39s]  All right, all right.
[7840.39s -> 7841.43s]  This is a classic.
[7841.43s -> 7841.93s]  Okay.
[7843.27s -> 7843.91s]  Should we get up?
[7843.91s -> 7844.55s]  Should we stand up?
[7844.55s -> 7845.05s]  Let's stand up.
[7846.07s -> 7848.76s]  I'll half stand.
[7848.76s -> 7849.24s]  I'll do this.
[7851.24s -> 7852.12s]  All right, all right.
[7853.54s -> 7854.10s]  Warming up.
[7855.62s -> 7857.46s]  He's running at such rapid pace around.
[7858.26s -> 7859.54s]  The crab, the crab.
[7859.54s -> 7860.18s]  That's a crab.
[7860.18s -> 7861.30s]  That's very good.
[7861.30s -> 7861.86s]  That's very good.
[7864.82s -> 7867.86s]  Oh, fuck a bit of a stumble.
[7867.86s -> 7868.90s]  Okay, I thought he was gonna.
[7870.10s -> 7870.90s]  Wait, wait, he's got more.
[7874.70s -> 7875.50s]  Holy shit.
[7876.54s -> 7878.14s]  Well, that's the same thing but twice.
[7878.14s -> 7879.34s]  He gets a three.
[7889.00s -> 7889.24s]  What?
[7889.24s -> 7890.12s]  What's the problem?
[7890.12s -> 7891.16s]  Why did she say no?
[7892.28s -> 7893.16s]  We got two nodes.
[7893.16s -> 7894.04s]  I immediately node.
[7894.04s -> 7894.68s]  He fell.
[7894.68s -> 7895.64s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7895.64s -> 7896.84s]  You stumbled.
[7896.84s -> 7898.68s]  That was fucking phenomenal.
[7898.68s -> 7899.08s]  Thank you.
[7899.08s -> 7900.04s]  We didn't have to.
[7900.04s -> 7900.84s]  Could I?
[7900.84s -> 7901.24s]  Go ahead.
[7901.88s -> 7904.68s]  As an avid German viewer, sometimes
[7904.68s -> 7907.24s]  German has through breakdancing
[7907.24s -> 7908.28s]  not been able to stream
[7908.28s -> 7909.96s]  for extended periods of time.
[7909.96s -> 7911.32s]  And when I saw you fall,
[7911.32s -> 7913.16s]  I had a that's a raven moment
[7913.16s -> 7914.68s]  where you were the German
[7914.68s -> 7915.72s]  and you hurt yourself.
[7916.36s -> 7917.88s]  Where's my streamer?
[7917.88s -> 7918.60s]  Right.
[7918.60s -> 7919.80s]  What do you think about that?
[7919.80s -> 7921.00s]  You have people depending on you.
[7921.00s -> 7922.04s]  You can't hurt yourself.
[7922.04s -> 7922.52s]  Totally.
[7923.48s -> 7924.52s]  First, safety is key.
[7925.32s -> 7926.28s]  Safety is number one.
[7926.28s -> 7929.54s]  Number two, I'm like a starfish
[7929.54s -> 7930.98s]  when it comes to like repairing
[7930.98s -> 7932.10s]  any sort of my body.
[7932.74s -> 7934.26s]  So just like quick recovery
[7934.26s -> 7935.78s]  like day or two in the hospital.
[7935.78s -> 7936.98s]  Just like Dr. Schmoyzen.
[7937.62s -> 7938.26s]  Can you?
[7938.26s -> 7939.94s]  What about starfish is Dr. Schmoyzen?
[7939.94s -> 7941.70s]  I think he's relating to something
[7943.74s -> 7944.78s]  that has to do with
[7946.46s -> 7948.22s]  you know, bones and tendons
[7948.22s -> 7949.50s]  and so on growing back.
[7950.22s -> 7952.06s]  But I don't think that that works
[7952.06s -> 7953.34s]  if you become paraplegic.
[7953.34s -> 7953.82s]  It's doctor.
[7953.82s -> 7954.62s]  Wait, Dr. Schmoyzen.
[7954.62s -> 7955.34s]  What's his blood type?
[7955.34s -> 7956.30s]  Is he is he a B?
[7957.02s -> 7958.46s]  I believe he's.
[7958.46s -> 7959.58s]  Oh, okay.
[7959.58s -> 7960.62s]  That's a big problem.
[7960.62s -> 7961.90s]  Okay, I believe he's old.
[7961.90s -> 7963.10s]  Oh, that's a big problem.
[7963.10s -> 7964.30s]  Have you donated before
[7964.30s -> 7965.82s]  your universal donor?
[7965.82s -> 7966.38s]  Yes.
[7966.38s -> 7966.70s]  Yes.
[7966.70s -> 7969.58s]  Yes, I have donated blood before.
[7969.58s -> 7971.10s]  We are, unfortunately,
[7972.89s -> 7973.61s]  we're split again.
[7974.33s -> 7976.36s]  I'm gonna phone.
[7976.36s -> 7977.32s]  I'm gonna have to call
[7977.32s -> 7978.28s]  italics on this one.
[7978.84s -> 7979.72s]  He fell.
[7979.72s -> 7981.08s]  That's the rule.
[7981.08s -> 7983.88s]  I think he has what it takes.
[7983.88s -> 7984.68s]  He has what it takes.
[7985.32s -> 7986.28s]  Okay, call.
[7986.28s -> 7986.76s]  Make a call.
[7986.76s -> 7987.88s]  Can we call italics, please?
[7987.88s -> 7988.36s]  Of course.
[7988.36s -> 7989.16s]  Get him on the line.
[7989.16s -> 7989.96s]  Another phone, a friend.
[7993.35s -> 7995.51s]  Okay, we got a few of these.
[7999.34s -> 8000.46s]  I thought it was phenomenal.
[8000.46s -> 8001.66s]  I think you guys are out of your mind.
[8002.22s -> 8004.98s]  I still don't get why you get a ring
[8004.98s -> 8005.86s]  when you call someone.
[8006.58s -> 8007.54s]  Because it's calling them
[8007.54s -> 8008.58s]  and it's ringing in their house.
[8008.58s -> 8008.90s]  Okay.
[8009.62s -> 8013.80s]  Do we have italics?
[8017.10s -> 8017.50s]  Hello?
[8018.68s -> 8019.16s]  Are you there?
[8023.98s -> 8024.94s]  I think I have the wrong number.
[8026.06s -> 8026.62s]  Try it again.
[8028.39s -> 8029.43s]  We're at an impasse.
[8029.43s -> 8029.83s]  I need.
[8030.39s -> 8031.35s]  Oh, wait, it's ringing.
[8031.35s -> 8031.83s]  It's ringing.
[8031.83s -> 8033.19s]  I think he's dodging your calls.
[8033.19s -> 8034.15s]  He's got caller ID.
[8036.98s -> 8038.42s]  We need an outside opinion.
[8038.42s -> 8039.14s]  I don't think...
[8039.14s -> 8040.10s]  I think he's got what it takes.
[8040.74s -> 8042.90s]  It's Alex.
[8042.90s -> 8044.10s]  Hey, can you hear me now?
[8044.10s -> 8044.66s]  Can hear you now.
[8044.66s -> 8045.38s]  It's Alex.
[8045.38s -> 8047.86s]  You're on Derma's Not Got Talent.
[8047.86s -> 8049.70s]  That would be a copyright infringement.
[8049.70s -> 8051.94s]  You're on Who Will Replace...
[8051.94s -> 8053.14s]  That's another copyright infringement.
[8053.14s -> 8054.26s]  Who Will Replace Me?
[8054.26s -> 8055.06s]  Welcome, it's Alex.
[8055.06s -> 8056.10s]  Welcome to the show.
[8056.10s -> 8056.90s]  We have number nine here.
[8056.90s -> 8058.02s]  You guys can hear me.
[8058.02s -> 8058.34s]  Yes.
[8059.06s -> 8060.26s]  I'm number 17.
[8060.26s -> 8061.62s]  You guys already do the interviews?
[8062.82s -> 8063.62s]  Yes, we did.
[8063.62s -> 8064.10s]  You weren't here.
[8065.74s -> 8066.70s]  Shit.
[8066.70s -> 8067.10s]  Yeah.
[8068.06s -> 8069.10s]  You were not available.
[8069.10s -> 8070.30s]  So we just kind of caught you.
[8070.30s -> 8071.02s]  So sorry, dude.
[8071.66s -> 8072.70s]  Are you watching right now?
[8072.70s -> 8074.06s]  Do you see who's on stage right now?
[8076.95s -> 8080.15s]  Listen, I'll just be real.
[8080.15s -> 8080.47s]  Yeah.
[8080.47s -> 8082.47s]  It doesn't even fucking matter who you guys pick
[8082.47s -> 8086.47s]  because all the plus twos are chat memes nowadays.
[8086.47s -> 8087.11s]  Yeah.
[8087.11s -> 8089.51s]  So where's the test to see which of these contestants
[8089.51s -> 8091.35s]  can pick the correct one guy comment?
[8092.23s -> 8092.71s]  Interesting.
[8094.87s -> 8095.35s]  Okay.
[8095.35s -> 8097.91s]  Well, so you're asking if he can pick
[8098.39s -> 8099.75s]  one guy comment out of chat
[8099.75s -> 8101.51s]  and that should be able to fix if he can do it?
[8103.29s -> 8103.69s]  Yeah.
[8103.69s -> 8107.29s]  I mean, pretty simple, just breaking it out.
[8107.29s -> 8108.73s]  Number nine, I got a question for you.
[8108.73s -> 8109.37s]  Yes.
[8109.37s -> 8111.61s]  So there's three comments in chat.
[8111.61s -> 8114.09s]  One of them says, you're a loser.
[8114.09s -> 8118.01s]  The second one says, hey, like shit into a bedpan
[8118.01s -> 8119.29s]  and show it on stream.
[8119.29s -> 8122.01s]  And the third person says, hey, Jerma,
[8122.01s -> 8123.61s]  you should play Destiny 2 PVP.
[8123.61s -> 8124.49s]  Which one are you going to read?
[8125.53s -> 8127.13s]  I'm going to go with number three.
[8127.13s -> 8128.33s]  I'm going to take that advice
[8129.53s -> 8131.61s]  and let the haters build me up.
[8131.61s -> 8132.97s]  That's very, very good idea.
[8132.97s -> 8133.61s]  Very good idea.
[8133.61s -> 8133.77s]  Thank you.
[8133.77s -> 8134.33s]  Very good idea.
[8135.21s -> 8135.69s]  It's Alex.
[8135.69s -> 8137.45s]  Thank you so much for the input.
[8138.01s -> 8139.45s]  But I think we have our decision here.
[8139.45s -> 8140.09s]  One last thing.
[8140.09s -> 8140.49s]  Okay.
[8140.49s -> 8140.81s]  Yeah.
[8141.53s -> 8143.46s]  I just want to say I've been watching
[8144.52s -> 8145.96s]  and I can't tell them apart
[8145.96s -> 8147.88s]  because I think the ultimate test should be
[8147.88s -> 8150.28s]  who looks the best wearing a chest brace
[8151.56s -> 8152.44s]  playing VR.
[8152.44s -> 8154.76s]  So if you could just get one of those on stage right now.
[8154.76s -> 8155.16s]  Hang up.
[8155.16s -> 8156.20s]  I hang up on him.
[8156.20s -> 8156.68s]  Hang up on him.
[8156.68s -> 8157.40s]  Call is breaking up.
[8157.40s -> 8158.04s]  I can't hear.
[8158.12s -> 8158.68s]  Hang up on him.
[8159.40s -> 8160.52s]  I couldn't hear anything.
[8160.52s -> 8161.56s]  I couldn't hear anything.
[8161.56s -> 8162.92s]  I'm a size medium if that matters.
[8163.48s -> 8164.68s]  No one was talking to you.
[8164.68s -> 8165.16s]  Be clear.
[8168.76s -> 8171.00s]  With that input, I think he goes through.
[8171.96s -> 8173.96s]  You like the picking the Destiny 2 comment?
[8173.96s -> 8176.04s]  I think he's got what it takes.
[8176.76s -> 8178.04s]  I'm just asking questions.
[8178.04s -> 8180.20s]  Can you do a little word play with me?
[8180.20s -> 8181.16s]  Yes, of course.
[8181.16s -> 8182.20s]  I want you to finish.
[8182.20s -> 8184.28s]  I'm going to say a word and you say a second word.
[8184.28s -> 8184.84s]  Okay.
[8184.84s -> 8185.64s]  Doll.
[8185.64s -> 8186.28s]  House.
[8186.28s -> 8186.92s]  Cat.
[8186.92s -> 8187.24s]  Mouse.
[8187.24s -> 8188.12s]  One for two.
[8188.12s -> 8188.60s]  There it is.
[8188.60s -> 8189.24s]  Bingo.
[8189.24s -> 8189.80s]  You can go on.
[8189.80s -> 8190.36s]  Bingo.
[8190.36s -> 8191.80s]  Number nine, you're moving on to the next round.
[8191.80s -> 8192.44s]  Thank you so much.
[8192.44s -> 8193.00s]  Thank you so much.
[8193.00s -> 8193.64s]  I won't let you down.
[8193.64s -> 8194.04s]  Thank you.
[8194.04s -> 8194.60s]  Thank you.
[8194.60s -> 8196.12s]  Somebody, the audio sucks.
[8196.12s -> 8197.32s]  I don't know what happened.
[8197.32s -> 8198.60s]  Did the call break up?
[8199.16s -> 8200.04s]  I'm so sorry.
[8200.04s -> 8200.84s]  I'm so sorry.
[8201.56s -> 8202.52s]  Call broke up.
[8202.52s -> 8204.60s]  FMV game audio.
[8204.60s -> 8205.32s]  Right?
[8205.32s -> 8206.92s]  You're reading that one guy comment.
[8206.92s -> 8208.20s]  That was literally one guy.
[8208.20s -> 8209.48s]  There was only one guy.
[8209.48s -> 8211.08s]  That was like a hundred guys.
[8211.08s -> 8213.00s]  I'm pretty sure in between all that I heard like
[8213.00s -> 8213.96s]  Jerma is great.
[8213.96s -> 8215.40s]  Jerma is doing fantastic.
[8215.40s -> 8216.60s]  And then you read the comment.
[8216.68s -> 8218.28s]  And then you read the one audio is messed up.
[8218.28s -> 8220.20s]  This guy wants us to play Destiny 2.
[8220.20s -> 8223.93s]  Destiny 2, I can't get a close up here.
[8223.93s -> 8230.39s]  I will never, ever, ever play Destiny 2 PVP ever.
[8231.19s -> 8234.14s]  It's never.
[8234.14s -> 8236.38s]  What are you doing?
[8236.38s -> 8237.74s]  He said he's like crawling over.
[8240.46s -> 8240.86s]  Okay.
[8241.50s -> 8242.78s]  Can we send the next person in please?
[8243.58s -> 8244.14s]  Number 10.
[8244.78s -> 8245.34s]  Number 10.
[8245.34s -> 8245.82s]  Number 10.
[8245.82s -> 8246.54s]  Double digits.
[8248.44s -> 8249.88s]  Oh, hey.
[8250.44s -> 8250.92s]  Yeah.
[8252.28s -> 8254.68s]  Okay.
[8254.68s -> 8255.24s]  That was cool.
[8255.24s -> 8257.08s]  I like that.
[8257.08s -> 8257.72s]  That was cool.
[8257.72s -> 8258.44s]  That was pretty cool.
[8259.40s -> 8260.36s]  Where are you from?
[8260.36s -> 8262.20s]  Oh, I'm from San Francisco.
[8262.20s -> 8263.16s]  You have a microphone.
[8263.72s -> 8264.04s]  Fuck me.
[8264.04s -> 8265.96s]  So I'm from San Francisco, born and raised.
[8265.96s -> 8266.60s]  Great.
[8266.60s -> 8269.64s]  So from San Francisco, from the town of Bay.
[8269.64s -> 8270.36s]  That's right.
[8270.36s -> 8275.72s]  So you're here to replace me, of course, ultimately, right?
[8275.72s -> 8276.20s]  Yes.
[8276.20s -> 8277.96s]  Only out of pure admiration though.
[8277.96s -> 8278.28s]  Okay.
[8278.28s -> 8278.52s]  Cool.
[8278.52s -> 8279.24s]  It's your time to retire.
[8279.24s -> 8281.08s]  I feel like I can ask you a few questions.
[8281.08s -> 8281.88s]  We all feel it.
[8281.88s -> 8282.36s]  Please.
[8282.36s -> 8284.52s]  Would you ever play VR games?
[8287.32s -> 8288.52s]  Yes.
[8288.52s -> 8290.68s]  Would you ever play Destiny 2 PVP?
[8290.68s -> 8291.72s]  No.
[8291.72s -> 8292.12s]  Okay.
[8292.12s -> 8292.44s]  Good.
[8292.44s -> 8292.92s]  Good answer.
[8294.44s -> 8295.48s]  One more question, sir.
[8295.48s -> 8296.04s]  Yes, doctor.
[8298.52s -> 8307.02s]  What is your blood pressure?
[8307.02s -> 8309.82s]  And I'm warning you, that's a trick question.
[8313.10s -> 8317.02s]  Uh, my blood pressure is absolutely excellent.
[8317.02s -> 8320.22s]  It's the healthiest blood pressure I think anyone has ever recorded.
[8320.22s -> 8321.26s]  It's a good Donald Trump.
[8321.26s -> 8321.98s]  Up until today.
[8322.86s -> 8324.14s]  My blood pressure is excellent.
[8324.14s -> 8327.18s]  The healthiest president I've seen in my life.
[8327.18s -> 8327.50s]  Okay.
[8327.50s -> 8329.90s]  So number 10, what are you going to do for us today?
[8329.90s -> 8335.10s]  Well, I have this talent that I developed into a skill over the last handful of years.
[8335.10s -> 8336.62s]  It all began one day.
[8336.62s -> 8341.18s]  I was in an absolute delirium and I demanded
[8341.18s -> 8345.18s]  for my friends to feed me coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[8345.18s -> 8347.66s]  And afterward, I completely lost my mind.
[8347.66s -> 8350.06s]  I went into a fugue state for the next couple of minutes.
[8350.06s -> 8350.46s]  Sure.
[8350.46s -> 8354.46s]  And I found out that this is what I did and I'd like to show you now.
[8354.46s -> 8354.78s]  Thank you.
[8354.78s -> 8355.26s]  Okay.
[8355.26s -> 8356.46s]  Just need a few minutes.
[8356.46s -> 8357.10s]  Sure.
[8357.10s -> 8358.22s]  Take as much time as you need.
[8358.22s -> 8360.14s]  So he's doing what he did in a fugue state.
[8360.14s -> 8360.78s]  In a fugue state.
[8360.78s -> 8361.98s]  But no longer in a fugue state.
[8361.98s -> 8362.86s]  Dr. Schmuckson, what's a fugue state?
[8362.86s -> 8363.58s]  Take it off.
[8363.58s -> 8364.30s]  What's a fugue state?
[8364.30s -> 8364.78s]  Let's go.
[8366.14s -> 8370.30s]  It's one of those states where it's kind of purposeful.
[8370.30s -> 8371.66s]  He's getting naked, actually.
[8371.66s -> 8373.10s]  What is he doing?
[8373.10s -> 8374.17s]  What?
[8374.17s -> 8374.73s]  What are you doing?
[8374.73s -> 8375.61s]  Can you take your shirt off?
[8375.61s -> 8376.33s]  His shirt's off.
[8377.21s -> 8380.04s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[8386.34s -> 8387.62s]  That's probably so loud.
[8390.26s -> 8391.38s]  This is your talent?
[8395.46s -> 8396.58s]  You're doing great.
[8396.58s -> 8397.86s]  It's a skill I made.
[8397.86s -> 8399.70s]  So what exactly are you doing?
[8399.70s -> 8400.18s]  It's obvious.
[8400.18s -> 8402.02s]  Well, if you pay close enough attention,
[8402.02s -> 8404.18s]  can I actually get a camera close up here?
[8404.18s -> 8405.78s]  If you pay close enough attention,
[8406.34s -> 8410.10s]  you can see the fat from my luscious love handles
[8410.10s -> 8412.90s]  actually sticking to the wood as I press down
[8412.90s -> 8414.50s]  and then as I come up from the mid-back.
[8415.38s -> 8415.86s]  Interesting.
[8415.86s -> 8417.62s]  It takes a lot of confidence to come on stage
[8417.62s -> 8419.14s]  and know the wood was correct for this.
[8419.14s -> 8422.98s]  It takes a lot of confidence to test your shirt off on stage.
[8423.62s -> 8424.34s]  Let's be honest.
[8424.34s -> 8426.10s]  And that's what I have for you today.
[8426.10s -> 8426.66s]  Wow.
[8426.66s -> 8427.54s]  That's it.
[8427.54s -> 8428.34s]  I'm floored.
[8428.34s -> 8429.30s]  Great job, number 10.
[8429.30s -> 8430.60s]  Thank you very much.
[8430.60s -> 8431.08s]  Very nice.
[8431.08s -> 8432.28s]  You can put your shirt back on.
[8432.28s -> 8432.76s]  Thank you.
[8432.76s -> 8434.28s]  Number 10, thank you so much for your time.
[8434.92s -> 8435.96s]  I'm going to know on this one
[8435.96s -> 8437.72s]  because I think that was just revolting and disgusting.
[8437.72s -> 8439.56s]  I would never do something like that in my life.
[8439.56s -> 8442.28s]  I don't want the next Jerma985 to be like lying on the ground
[8442.28s -> 8443.32s]  and farting in camera.
[8443.32s -> 8443.96s]  I think it was revolting.
[8443.96s -> 8446.76s]  I think with the hot tub meta coming up and rising,
[8446.76s -> 8449.08s]  we're going to need some more of this bravado.
[8449.64s -> 8452.04s]  Some more of like a more sexual comedy Jerma
[8452.04s -> 8453.24s]  I've been looking for for years.
[8453.24s -> 8454.12s]  More blue humor.
[8455.24s -> 8458.44s]  I feel like in the dollhouse, you publicly shit yourself.
[8459.32s -> 8460.44s]  But you're above that.
[8462.14s -> 8464.22s]  I mean, I don't take my clothes off like on stream.
[8464.30s -> 8465.02s]  It's fair.
[8465.02s -> 8466.74s]  Schmikeson, do we have any input from you?
[8466.74s -> 8469.14s]  I'm a little conflicted on this one, guys.
[8472.52s -> 8477.08s]  Physically, that was ridiculous enough that you could be Jerma.
[8477.88s -> 8479.72s]  However, I was a little, I mean,
[8480.76s -> 8484.28s]  watching things kind of squish, make squish noises on the floor.
[8484.28s -> 8487.88s]  I just have to say I'm conflicted.
[8490.36s -> 8491.32s]  Doctor, I'm with you here.
[8491.88s -> 8494.60s]  I'm not as set in stone as Ster seems to be.
[8494.92s -> 8495.72s]  I don't know.
[8495.72s -> 8497.56s]  I think that I wouldn't do something like that.
[8497.56s -> 8497.80s]  All right.
[8497.80s -> 8499.72s]  Don't you think there's like something maybe he could do
[8500.78s -> 8505.85s]  after the show to convince you to fart in front of him?
[8505.85s -> 8507.29s]  What are you talking about?
[8508.97s -> 8510.25s]  Fart in the parking lot?
[8510.97s -> 8512.01s]  There's a lot of that mean.
[8513.05s -> 8513.93s]  What is that supposed to mean?
[8513.93s -> 8515.77s]  Like he's going to fart in the parking lot in front of him?
[8515.77s -> 8516.73s]  Like fart in his face?
[8516.73s -> 8518.41s]  This is a final kind of test for me.
[8519.05s -> 8522.33s]  I want you to imagine you're a substitute teacher
[8523.29s -> 8524.89s]  and the kids are getting rowdy.
[8525.85s -> 8528.33s]  Make a noise to have them silence down.
[8528.33s -> 8528.97s]  The floor is yours.
[8528.97s -> 8529.69s]  You have a few seconds.
[8529.69s -> 8530.81s]  It's a good call, Ludwig.
[8537.37s -> 8538.33s]  I'm pulling mine back.
[8539.21s -> 8540.17s]  I'm pulling mine back.
[8540.17s -> 8540.67s]  Whoa.
[8541.93s -> 8543.61s]  Jerma, don't you think that this would be an...
[8544.41s -> 8545.61s]  I don't have to convince you anymore.
[8545.61s -> 8547.29s]  The rest of you, this would be an important skill
[8547.29s -> 8549.53s]  for a Jerma to have if you were going to go to a water park.
[8549.53s -> 8550.49s]  I don't think you have to convince anyone.
[8550.49s -> 8552.89s]  There's only one X right now.
[8552.89s -> 8553.85s]  He pulled back as well.
[8553.85s -> 8556.73s]  Oh, oh, great job.
[8558.01s -> 8558.57s]  You're on.
[8558.57s -> 8560.01s]  Leave before they disagree.
[8560.01s -> 8561.77s]  You have made it through the next round.
[8561.77s -> 8562.49s]  Thank you, number 10.
[8562.49s -> 8563.85s]  Very, very nice farting sounds.
[8563.85s -> 8564.81s]  Appreciate it, gentlemen.
[8564.81s -> 8565.45s]  Back to the big time.
[8565.45s -> 8566.33s]  Have a great day.
[8566.33s -> 8567.37s]  Back to the big time.
[8567.37s -> 8567.93s]  Back to the big time.
[8567.93s -> 8569.21s]  No, wait, I'm out.
[8569.21s -> 8569.69s]  We're good?
[8569.69s -> 8570.17s]  We're good.
[8570.17s -> 8570.81s]  We're good.
[8570.81s -> 8571.29s]  We're good?
[8571.29s -> 8571.93s]  We're good.
[8571.93s -> 8572.97s]  That was tough.
[8572.97s -> 8574.25s]  You're just a bit tall, I thought.
[8574.25s -> 8574.97s]  You think it's too tall?
[8574.97s -> 8575.47s]  Yeah.
[8576.42s -> 8577.22s]  I'm a smidge.
[8578.26s -> 8580.50s]  I mean, I'm 5'7", 5'8", with shoes.
[8580.50s -> 8581.62s]  You're 5'7".
[8581.62s -> 8583.22s]  I'm 5'8", with shoes.
[8583.22s -> 8585.70s]  But you can't say I'm 5'7", 5'8", and then throw it with shoes.
[8585.78s -> 8588.50s]  I feel like you can round up to 6'.
[8589.38s -> 8590.58s]  Gentlemen, we've been over this.
[8590.58s -> 8591.46s]  We've been over this.
[8591.46s -> 8594.42s]  Doctor, you've measured my height a dozen times.
[8594.42s -> 8595.06s]  Yes, I have.
[8595.06s -> 8596.18s]  How tall am I actually?
[8596.18s -> 8596.98s]  I don't know.
[8596.98s -> 8598.58s]  You will never take your shoes off.
[8598.58s -> 8601.70s]  So, you know, it doesn't make that easy.
[8601.70s -> 8604.98s]  When you're measuring someone's height and you have to submit it in the record.
[8604.98s -> 8605.46s]  You're my doctor.
[8605.46s -> 8606.50s]  Can you do it with shoes?
[8607.94s -> 8610.58s]  You can ordinarily do it with shoes,
[8610.58s -> 8615.86s]  but say there's something that is kind of hiding from us.
[8616.42s -> 8617.22s]  In the shoes.
[8617.22s -> 8617.86s]  Oh!
[8617.86s -> 8620.82s]  Okay, but how tall am I, doctor, with shoes?
[8620.82s -> 8622.02s]  What's in the shoes, Jerma?
[8622.02s -> 8622.58s]  Nothing, just shoes.
[8622.58s -> 8623.70s]  What's in the shoes?
[8623.70s -> 8625.46s]  What's in the damn shoes, Jerma?
[8625.46s -> 8628.90s]  Well, you guys, why is this such a weird, like, persecution bullshit?
[8628.90s -> 8629.86s]  I have shoes on.
[8629.86s -> 8631.78s]  I've dressed, I wear dress shoes to the doctor.
[8631.78s -> 8632.34s]  Is that weird?
[8633.54s -> 8633.62s]  Kind of, yeah.
[8633.62s -> 8635.06s]  To make sure I'm over 5'8", and a half.
[8635.62s -> 8636.82s]  I'm cringing.
[8636.82s -> 8637.62s]  No, you're not.
[8637.62s -> 8638.34s]  You would go like this.
[8639.40s -> 8640.44s]  I'm pogging.
[8640.44s -> 8640.92s]  There we go.
[8641.72s -> 8642.52s]  You're pogging about his feet?
[8642.52s -> 8643.56s]  5'8", with shoes.
[8643.56s -> 8644.84s]  You can say that whenever you want.
[8644.84s -> 8645.56s]  All right, anyways.
[8646.44s -> 8647.24s]  5'8", with shoes.
[8648.60s -> 8649.64s]  Another piano?
[8650.52s -> 8651.96s]  There's only been two pianos.
[8651.96s -> 8653.32s]  It's not like it's been, like, all day.
[8655.32s -> 8657.16s]  Not the second piano for the whole day.
[8657.16s -> 8659.08s]  This is going to have to be better than other piano.
[8659.08s -> 8660.44s]  Now, that's what I call music.
[8661.80s -> 8662.76s]  It's number 11, right?
[8662.76s -> 8663.96s]  This is 11, yeah.
[8663.96s -> 8664.68s]  Big one, one.
[8665.40s -> 8667.32s]  Number 11, if you're ready to come out, we're ready to see you.
[8670.20s -> 8671.24s]  Hello, number 11.
[8671.24s -> 8671.74s]  Hey.
[8674.90s -> 8676.10s]  How are you guys?
[8676.10s -> 8676.66s]  Very good.
[8677.22s -> 8679.94s]  I noticed your Dark Souls Play 3 didn't really know what you were doing.
[8679.94s -> 8681.78s]  Hopefully, you know what you're doing with the piano.
[8681.78s -> 8682.82s]  I sure hope so, too, yeah.
[8682.82s -> 8683.78s]  I hope so, too, yeah.
[8684.34s -> 8685.94s]  What are you going to do for us, number 11?
[8686.74s -> 8690.42s]  Well, I'm actually going to play you a ballad, a nice, pretty song.
[8690.42s -> 8690.82s]  Okay.
[8690.82s -> 8691.86s]  Thought I'd change it up a little bit.
[8691.86s -> 8692.98s]  Can I ask you a question?
[8692.98s -> 8693.62s]  Of course.
[8693.62s -> 8697.06s]  If you were hungry late at night, what would you order for McDonald's?
[8697.06s -> 8697.62s]  Oh, boy.
[8697.62s -> 8698.18s]  This is big.
[8698.74s -> 8700.02s]  I have a signature.
[8700.02s -> 8702.82s]  McChicken Plains, small fries, snack size, M&M McFlurry.
[8703.46s -> 8703.78s]  Wow.
[8703.78s -> 8704.66s]  M&M McFlurry, that's pretty good.
[8704.66s -> 8706.02s]  Just enough calories to pass.
[8706.26s -> 8706.98s]  Exactly, right?
[8708.98s -> 8709.94s]  Well, go ahead, please.
[8709.94s -> 8712.42s]  Yeah, we're really excited to see your piano work.
[8714.02s -> 8716.34s]  I love how it's calorie count, not like, okay.
[8717.38s -> 8719.59s]  So what song are you going to do for us, number 11?
[8719.59s -> 8720.31s]  He already-
[8720.31s -> 8720.95s]  It's a ballad.
[8720.95s -> 8721.67s]  It's a ballad.
[8721.67s -> 8722.55s]  What ballad?
[8722.55s -> 8723.51s]  We need to know.
[8723.51s -> 8724.63s]  It's a ballad.
[8724.63s -> 8724.95s]  A ballad?
[8724.95s -> 8726.39s]  The music speaks for itself.
[8727.43s -> 8727.91s]  Focus.
[8727.91s -> 8729.75s]  Can you look at a rash on my back a little?
[8730.95s -> 8733.51s]  It's called a strange room.
[8733.51s -> 8734.47s]  A strange room, okay.
[8745.02s -> 8745.82s]  No, wait, no, no!
[8746.38s -> 8746.62s]  What?
[8747.26s -> 8748.47s]  Did you just get the shit out of me?
[8748.47s -> 8748.63s]  No.
[8748.63s -> 8748.95s]  What are you doing?
[8748.95s -> 8749.67s]  It's nothing.
[8749.67s -> 8750.39s]  And he kept going.
[8750.39s -> 8751.19s]  That's really good.
[8751.19s -> 8751.99s]  That's big.
[8751.99s -> 8752.79s]  That actually-
[8752.79s -> 8754.15s]  You tried to fuck him up.
[8754.15s -> 8754.63s]  Didn't work.
[8755.67s -> 8757.51s]  Don't you press that button, I'll be pissed.
[8758.95s -> 8759.99s]  Not again, okay?
[8788.14s -> 8794.54s]  Church that plays the good.
[8810.66s -> 8811.38s]  That was a good finish.
[8811.38s -> 8812.74s]  No, pull it back.
[8812.74s -> 8813.30s]  Pull it back.
[8813.30s -> 8814.34s]  That was unfair.
[8814.34s -> 8815.06s]  Convince me.
[8815.62s -> 8817.94s]  Stop with the making me make my decisions, Danny.
[8817.94s -> 8818.74s]  Okay, listen.
[8818.74s -> 8819.70s]  Did everybody-
[8819.70s -> 8820.10s]  What the fuck?
[8820.10s -> 8820.98s]  We all buzzed.
[8820.98s -> 8822.26s]  Can I ask you a couple questions?
[8823.38s -> 8824.50s]  Where did you serve your mission?
[8825.78s -> 8831.70s]  You know, it's so funny you say that because I'm actually ex-Mormon.
[8831.70s -> 8834.18s]  Ah, yeah, I spotted it.
[8834.18s -> 8834.90s]  You spotted it?
[8834.90s -> 8835.78s]  I spotted it.
[8835.78s -> 8836.66s]  How do you spot something like that?
[8836.66s -> 8837.78s]  It's obvious, Jerma.
[8837.78s -> 8839.06s]  I'm white and I play piano.
[8839.06s -> 8840.34s]  I think that's a dead-game.
[8840.34s -> 8841.46s]  He said the word church, too.
[8843.14s -> 8843.78s]  It's not a church.
[8844.50s -> 8846.10s]  Ah, is it not?
[8846.10s -> 8846.42s]  No.
[8846.42s -> 8848.10s]  It's an original?
[8848.10s -> 8849.70s]  It's a cover by my favorite band.
[8850.66s -> 8852.18s]  When did you leave the church?
[8852.18s -> 8853.06s]  I thought that was really good.
[8853.78s -> 8854.90s]  When I turned 18.
[8855.38s -> 8856.90s]  Don't put 20 questions in the box.
[8856.90s -> 8857.70s]  It's just a couple.
[8857.70s -> 8859.06s]  It's not that big of a deal.
[8859.06s -> 8860.18s]  No more questions?
[8860.18s -> 8861.14s]  No more questions?
[8861.14s -> 8862.02s]  No more questions?
[8862.02s -> 8863.14s]  I do have a question.
[8864.98s -> 8868.58s]  That doesn't really relate to what the others have been talking about,
[8868.58s -> 8870.90s]  but could you do that standing on your head?
[8874.82s -> 8877.38s]  Actually, yeah, in Amadeus, how he does it turned over.
[8877.38s -> 8878.26s]  Can we get some of that?
[8880.33s -> 8880.89s]  I don't-
[8880.89s -> 8882.73s]  Listen, I'm the only one that didn't say no.
[8883.37s -> 8884.49s]  I thought that was phenomenal.
[8884.49s -> 8885.53s]  I thought you did a great job.
[8886.25s -> 8888.73s]  I don't listen to any of these jokers.
[8888.73s -> 8889.85s]  I thought that was great.
[8889.85s -> 8890.41s]  Well, thank you.
[8891.21s -> 8892.17s]  You know what my problem is?
[8893.05s -> 8894.97s]  He's absolutely delightful.
[8894.97s -> 8895.29s]  Yeah.
[8895.29s -> 8896.25s]  A pleasure to be around.
[8896.25s -> 8897.53s]  Want to know what my problem is?
[8897.53s -> 8898.65s]  That doesn't work, right?
[8898.65s -> 8899.53s]  Second piano guy.
[8900.57s -> 8901.45s]  Well, I think that's unfair.
[8901.45s -> 8903.45s]  You can't play a piano more than one-
[8903.45s -> 8905.21s]  The 16 people stir.
[8905.21s -> 8906.65s]  There's so many instruments.
[8906.65s -> 8910.57s]  I just feel like you're riding the coattails of the success you saw from the backstage.
[8911.61s -> 8913.69s]  Anybody changing their vote or is this it?
[8913.69s -> 8916.87s]  I think he's too sweet.
[8918.07s -> 8920.55s]  Number 11, you're apparently too nice of a person.
[8920.55s -> 8924.47s]  You're too good and nice of a person to take the moniker of Meade,
[8924.47s -> 8927.75s]  who is also a nice person, who tries to be nice to everybody
[8927.75s -> 8931.11s]  and be cool to his friends and his doctor and everything and have fun with him and stuff.
[8931.11s -> 8932.87s]  Don't listen to all of that, please.
[8934.31s -> 8934.95s]  Okay.
[8934.95s -> 8935.99s]  Number 11, I'm so sorry.
[8937.59s -> 8938.79s]  I wanted you.
[8938.79s -> 8941.43s]  Please go live a fantastic, healthy life.
[8941.43s -> 8941.93s]  That's right.
[8942.95s -> 8944.07s]  Number 11, thank you so much.
[8944.07s -> 8945.35s]  Sword to the stars.
[8945.35s -> 8946.63s]  That's unfortunate.
[8946.63s -> 8947.91s]  I thought he had what it took.
[8947.91s -> 8948.63s]  Apparently not.
[8948.63s -> 8950.71s]  I didn't want to ruin a young boy's life.
[8951.83s -> 8953.27s]  I thought he had what it took.
[8953.27s -> 8954.15s]  That's unfortunate.
[8954.15s -> 8956.71s]  I mean, look, because he was ex-Mormon, who cares?
[8956.71s -> 8958.47s]  I said it had nothing to do with the Mormon.
[8958.47s -> 8959.59s]  Oh, it definitely did.
[8959.59s -> 8961.03s]  It was because he was too sweet.
[8961.03s -> 8962.71s]  A year on Twitch, he'd be hitting the pipe.
[8962.71s -> 8963.51s]  I can't see him-
[8965.91s -> 8966.41s]  Wrong.
[8967.59s -> 8968.79s]  He's not unhinged enough.
[8969.59s -> 8973.19s]  Maybe he wasn't as unhinged, but maybe there's a new era of a nice-
[8974.31s -> 8976.55s]  That is not the new era.
[8976.55s -> 8977.43s]  You're way off.
[8977.43s -> 8979.27s]  We're going to play Animal Crossing today.
[8979.27s -> 8980.87s]  I played Animal Crossing when it came out.
[8981.75s -> 8987.18s]  That was the biggest mistake of your career.
[8987.18s -> 8987.74s]  No, it wasn't.
[8987.74s -> 8991.50s]  It's a fun, sweet, cute game with like animals and like the KK Slider goes like...
[8993.02s -> 8994.70s]  It's like, oh wow, what a fucking fun game.
[8994.70s -> 8996.54s]  That's exactly what you're doing right now.
[8996.54s -> 8996.86s]  What?
[8996.86s -> 8997.66s]  You think he's doing that?
[8998.22s -> 8999.02s]  He might.
[8999.02s -> 9000.86s]  No, he would be much more awesome at night.
[9002.06s -> 9002.86s]  Sorry, Professor.
[9002.86s -> 9003.50s]  Thank you.
[9003.50s -> 9004.62s]  He's a doctor, for God's sake.
[9004.62s -> 9006.06s]  Are they the same?
[9006.06s -> 9006.46s]  Are they the same?
[9006.46s -> 9007.34s]  He could be both.
[9007.34s -> 9007.98s]  Can you be both?
[9007.98s -> 9009.02s]  Are you a professor as well?
[9010.38s -> 9013.90s]  Yeah, actually, I am a professor as well.
[9013.90s -> 9015.34s]  That's true, technically.
[9016.14s -> 9017.18s]  What does technically mean?
[9018.07s -> 9021.83s]  Technically means a lot of different things and I don't choose to name them.
[9021.83s -> 9022.39s]  Okay.
[9022.39s -> 9022.95s]  All right.
[9022.95s -> 9024.31s]  He's a doctor, he's a professor, he's everything.
[9024.31s -> 9025.27s]  Are we playing 20 questions now?
[9025.27s -> 9025.99s]  So...
[9025.99s -> 9029.27s]  Yeah, I mean, you were going off on Ludwig for asking that guy questions.
[9030.39s -> 9031.67s]  He said it's definitely Ludwig.
[9031.67s -> 9033.11s]  You said his name wrong, by the way.
[9033.11s -> 9034.31s]  That's a fucking X, by the way.
[9035.19s -> 9036.15s]  I'm positive.
[9036.63s -> 9038.63s]  I looked you up on Wiki before this.
[9038.63s -> 9039.27s]  It's Ludwig.
[9040.63s -> 9041.67s]  He doesn't even know his own name.
[9041.67s -> 9042.63s]  I know it, though.
[9042.63s -> 9043.43s]  That's his name.
[9043.43s -> 9043.91s]  Ludwig.
[9043.91s -> 9046.55s]  Well, go on YouTube and there's like the pronounce, how to pronounce.
[9046.55s -> 9046.95s]  Yeah.
[9046.95s -> 9047.67s]  It's Ludwig.
[9048.31s -> 9049.59s]  But I don't go by that.
[9049.59s -> 9050.31s]  Ludwig.
[9050.31s -> 9050.87s]  Okay, you know how...
[9050.87s -> 9052.23s]  Just call him Ludwig, it's easy.
[9053.11s -> 9057.98s]  Who do we got coming up next?
[9057.98s -> 9059.02s]  Number 13, I believe.
[9059.02s -> 9059.50s]  Number 13?
[9059.50s -> 9060.70s]  Lucky number 13.
[9060.70s -> 9061.74s]  Number 13.
[9061.74s -> 9063.02s]  What do you got for us coming out here?
[9065.11s -> 9065.59s]  All right.
[9067.99s -> 9068.79s]  Nunchuck.
[9068.95s -> 9070.15s]  He's ready to go.
[9070.15s -> 9071.59s]  By the way, let's make it really clear.
[9072.23s -> 9074.23s]  The nearest hospital, are we going to find that?
[9074.23s -> 9075.59s]  Because he might hurt somebody.
[9077.35s -> 9078.79s]  Medical kit is in the back.
[9079.83s -> 9081.43s]  We do have a doctor right here in case...
[9081.43s -> 9082.39s]  On the eye.
[9082.39s -> 9085.11s]  If I feel it slipping, I tend not to let it hit myself.
[9085.11s -> 9085.91s]  I'd rather it go out.
[9085.91s -> 9087.19s]  Okay, so we should duck.
[9087.19s -> 9088.07s]  Oh, so...
[9088.07s -> 9090.15s]  You guys look like you have quick reflexes, though.
[9090.63s -> 9091.11s]  Quick enough.
[9091.11s -> 9091.51s]  Quick enough.
[9091.51s -> 9092.07s]  Yeah, yeah.
[9092.07s -> 9094.79s]  So are you going to do a routine with those nunchucks?
[9094.79s -> 9095.51s]  I'd like to.
[9096.23s -> 9097.19s]  Okay, so any back...
[9097.19s -> 9098.15s]  If it pleases the judges.
[9098.15s -> 9098.71s]  Any backstory?
[9099.27s -> 9100.39s]  You were the Russia guy.
[9100.39s -> 9102.71s]  You talked to us all about Russia and Tetris.
[9102.71s -> 9103.67s]  Oh, yes.
[9104.71s -> 9104.79s]  Well...
[9104.79s -> 9105.51s]  Did you forget...
[9106.55s -> 9108.15s]  Forget my Russian history?
[9108.15s -> 9108.71s]  What?
[9108.71s -> 9109.91s]  You had a...
[9109.91s -> 9110.87s]  It washed over you.
[9110.87s -> 9113.51s]  You forgot what you did in the previous segment.
[9113.51s -> 9117.19s]  No, he reminded me of my Russian history with Tetris.
[9117.99s -> 9121.03s]  My history with nunchucks is a lot more limited.
[9121.03s -> 9124.39s]  My grandma used to just call me the poor man's Bruce Lee when I was a kid.
[9124.95s -> 9126.15s]  She was off her meds a lot.
[9126.15s -> 9127.35s]  But I took it to heart.
[9127.35s -> 9131.75s]  And I decided to pick up the nunchucks in his honor.
[9131.75s -> 9132.15s]  Interesting.
[9132.15s -> 9132.87s]  Beautiful.
[9132.87s -> 9134.63s]  Yeah, so it's a thing that got to stay with me.
[9135.19s -> 9137.03s]  Have you ever hit yourself with the nuts with the nunchucks?
[9137.03s -> 9137.51s]  Yes.
[9137.51s -> 9137.83s]  Okay.
[9137.83s -> 9139.91s]  It's kind of a hazard.
[9139.91s -> 9140.79s]  It's gonna happen.
[9140.79s -> 9141.43s]  Was it comedic?
[9141.43s -> 9144.71s]  They tell you with motorcycles, if you ride long enough, you're gonna fall.
[9144.71s -> 9147.27s]  If you chuck long enough, you're gonna fall.
[9147.27s -> 9149.67s]  Were there more than three people in the room that thought it was funny?
[9151.59s -> 9152.79s]  Only alone, yeah.
[9152.79s -> 9155.03s]  I like to do really unsafe stuff when I'm alone.
[9155.03s -> 9155.51s]  Yeah, okay.
[9155.51s -> 9156.07s]  That sounds like...
[9156.07s -> 9157.03s]  So you don't get embarrassed.
[9157.51s -> 9158.07s]  The nuts went a little...
[9158.07s -> 9158.87s]  I'm just not sure.
[9159.51s -> 9160.87s]  Was it on purpose in that case?
[9160.87s -> 9161.83s]  Did you do it on purpose?
[9161.83s -> 9162.63s]  No, no.
[9162.63s -> 9163.19s]  Okay.
[9163.19s -> 9163.51s]  No.
[9163.51s -> 9164.15s]  What once.
[9164.87s -> 9167.11s]  So you're gonna do a routine with the nunchucks and...
[9167.11s -> 9167.43s]  Okay.
[9167.43s -> 9168.23s]  I'd like to.
[9168.23s -> 9169.19s]  Yeah, for sure.
[9169.19s -> 9170.55s]  Number 13, whenever you're ready, for sure.
[9170.55s -> 9171.19s]  Okay.
[9171.19s -> 9171.59s]  Thank you.
[9172.23s -> 9173.11s]  I do dangerous shit.
[9173.11s -> 9174.15s]  That's pretty cool.
[9174.15s -> 9174.79s]  You do, yeah.
[9174.79s -> 9175.83s]  I jump through a window and...
[9175.83s -> 9176.07s]  Wow.
[9176.07s -> 9176.63s]  That's true, actually.
[9176.63s -> 9176.95s]  That's true.
[9177.75s -> 9179.03s]  You have a history of that.
[9180.23s -> 9182.86s]  All right.
[9188.41s -> 9189.37s]  So close to his face.
[9190.25s -> 9190.49s]  Wow.
[9191.53s -> 9192.09s]  The danger.
[9193.13s -> 9194.49s]  Dr. Schwantz says you can cover.
[9196.57s -> 9197.85s]  Dr. Schwantz is scared.
[9200.97s -> 9201.45s]  Ooh.
[9201.45s -> 9201.77s]  Oh.
[9202.49s -> 9203.53s]  Whoa.
[9203.53s -> 9203.85s]  Wow.
[9203.85s -> 9205.21s]  That's what a flip looks like.
[9205.21s -> 9205.93s]  There's two.
[9205.93s -> 9206.65s]  Give us one more.
[9207.29s -> 9207.85s]  Whoa.
[9209.29s -> 9211.05s]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[9211.05s -> 9211.85s]  Oh, no way.
[9211.85s -> 9212.33s]  Oh, man.
[9213.53s -> 9214.01s]  No way.
[9214.01s -> 9215.13s]  Who wouldn't want to do that?
[9215.13s -> 9215.93s]  Four.
[9215.93s -> 9216.17s]  Okay.
[9216.17s -> 9216.73s]  This is what I wanted to do.
[9217.61s -> 9218.97s]  Oh, number 13.
[9218.97s -> 9220.49s]  That was a tease, but that was good.
[9220.49s -> 9221.45s]  That was very good.
[9221.45s -> 9222.33s]  Wow.
[9222.33s -> 9222.97s]  Very good.
[9222.97s -> 9223.85s]  Number 13.
[9224.73s -> 9227.50s]  Do we have any Xs at all on this table?
[9228.06s -> 9229.42s]  I'm afraid not.
[9230.06s -> 9230.62s]  Number 13.
[9230.62s -> 9231.34s]  That was phenomenal.
[9231.34s -> 9232.14s]  That was unbelievable.
[9232.70s -> 9233.82s]  Somebody would take my place
[9234.54s -> 9235.26s]  doing something.
[9235.26s -> 9235.74s]  I mean, that was...
[9237.10s -> 9238.70s]  If you would hit your nuts once in a while,
[9238.70s -> 9239.18s]  it'd be funny.
[9239.90s -> 9240.78s]  But be careful.
[9240.78s -> 9241.50s]  Oh.
[9241.50s -> 9241.90s]  Oh.
[9241.90s -> 9242.62s]  Oh.
[9242.62s -> 9243.34s]  Of course.
[9243.34s -> 9246.14s]  Oh, he's got jokes.
[9247.26s -> 9248.30s]  Jokes on you.
[9248.30s -> 9248.78s]  I don't have any.
[9248.78s -> 9250.94s]  You got no Xs, number 13.
[9250.94s -> 9251.74s]  That's a plus.
[9251.74s -> 9252.14s]  That's a plus.
[9252.14s -> 9252.46s]  That is.
[9252.46s -> 9254.30s]  Welcome to the next round, number 13.
[9254.30s -> 9255.02s]  Thank you so much.
[9255.02s -> 9255.74s]  All right, sir.
[9255.74s -> 9257.18s]  Excellent luck, 13.
[9257.18s -> 9257.74s]  Thank you.
[9257.74s -> 9258.70s]  It's an obvious choice.
[9258.70s -> 9261.10s]  All about the next procedure operation.
[9261.10s -> 9262.22s]  How many have you passed through?
[9262.94s -> 9263.90s]  Four or five?
[9263.90s -> 9265.16s]  I think like two now.
[9265.88s -> 9266.92s]  It's like six.
[9266.92s -> 9267.56s]  Okay.
[9267.56s -> 9270.74s]  What do we got coming up next?
[9271.64s -> 9274.36s]  Oh, another chair sitter.
[9275.08s -> 9276.36s]  Don't call them chair sitters.
[9276.36s -> 9277.08s]  That's bullshit.
[9277.64s -> 9278.92s]  They're a musician.
[9278.92s -> 9280.36s]  I'm just going to sit on my chair.
[9280.36s -> 9280.84s]  Doesn't...
[9280.84s -> 9281.56s]  Don't streamers...
[9282.28s -> 9282.68s]  That's his...
[9283.40s -> 9285.32s]  I sit in a chair and I play like...
[9285.32s -> 9286.28s]  I was going to say Among Us,
[9286.28s -> 9287.32s]  but I didn't play that game.
[9287.32s -> 9289.48s]  I see you walking around on VR.
[9290.20s -> 9291.40s]  I saw you walking earlier.
[9292.86s -> 9294.06s]  I know that you can do more.
[9294.06s -> 9294.94s]  I don't know that they can.
[9296.14s -> 9297.82s]  They obviously can because they're dancing
[9297.82s -> 9298.70s]  and moving around playing.
[9299.98s -> 9301.10s]  Are you implying that you don't know
[9301.10s -> 9302.62s]  if they could walk around?
[9302.62s -> 9305.34s]  I feel like when you see them come on the stage,
[9305.34s -> 9307.02s]  that's the only time they do it.
[9307.02s -> 9308.30s]  Everywhere else, someone's carrying them.
[9308.30s -> 9309.26s]  You don't know if they're standing
[9309.26s -> 9310.62s]  when they're outside the camera.
[9310.62s -> 9312.46s]  That's completely inaccurate.
[9312.46s -> 9313.82s]  This is a talent that they are showing us.
[9313.82s -> 9315.50s]  It could be like an FDR.
[9315.50s -> 9316.14s]  You never know.
[9318.02s -> 9318.90s]  It could be.
[9318.90s -> 9319.46s]  It's a talent.
[9321.58s -> 9323.58s]  So there's a streaming world
[9323.58s -> 9325.32s]  and the other world.
[9325.32s -> 9326.52s]  There's a streaming world, yeah.
[9327.72s -> 9330.42s]  Doctor, you know very well.
[9330.42s -> 9333.30s]  Well, maybe this is the only world.
[9333.30s -> 9334.98s]  Well, according to the metaverse,
[9334.98s -> 9336.50s]  we'll be all on the same world soon.
[9337.46s -> 9338.18s]  Some of us.
[9338.18s -> 9342.18s]  If you get the Sims 2 level of graphics
[9342.18s -> 9344.58s]  and interaction with the goggles
[9344.58s -> 9347.86s]  that are out here, maybe Sims 1
[9347.86s -> 9349.14s]  level of graphical integrity.
[9350.34s -> 9351.38s]  You're hung up on the graphics,
[9351.38s -> 9353.06s]  but not the connectivity of all mankind.
[9353.06s -> 9354.42s]  And everybody has no legs.
[9354.42s -> 9355.14s]  It's very odd.
[9355.14s -> 9355.70s]  It's very odd.
[9355.70s -> 9356.58s]  It's going to take off though.
[9357.14s -> 9357.62s]  I think so.
[9358.42s -> 9361.22s]  So in what year are we all floating heads?
[9361.22s -> 9361.94s]  2080.
[9361.94s -> 9363.30s]  We're like 50 years too early.
[9366.36s -> 9368.12s]  We're about 50 years too early, I would say.
[9369.85s -> 9370.41s]  So what do we got?
[9370.41s -> 9371.05s]  We got number...
[9372.33s -> 9374.97s]  Don't buzz unless somebody is actually here.
[9374.97s -> 9376.41s]  I fucking told you.
[9377.72s -> 9379.00s]  14, how are you?
[9379.00s -> 9379.80s]  Welcome to the show.
[9380.76s -> 9381.24s]  How are you?
[9381.24s -> 9382.20s]  Stop pressing buttons.
[9382.20s -> 9383.24s]  He's showing me what not to do.
[9383.24s -> 9383.96s]  Stop.
[9383.96s -> 9384.52s]  Clear them all.
[9385.40s -> 9387.13s]  14, how are you?
[9387.13s -> 9387.45s]  Welcome.
[9388.81s -> 9390.25s]  I'm going to punch you in the face as hard as I can.
[9391.77s -> 9392.17s]  Let's go.
[9392.17s -> 9392.81s]  You want to go?
[9392.81s -> 9393.45s]  Hi, 14.
[9393.45s -> 9394.41s]  How are you doing today?
[9394.41s -> 9395.13s]  Hi, 14.
[9395.13s -> 9396.89s]  What are you doing for us?
[9396.89s -> 9398.33s]  I'm going to play the piano.
[9398.33s -> 9399.05s]  Wow, piano.
[9399.05s -> 9400.01s]  Where did you learn that?
[9400.01s -> 9401.05s]  Don't say, wow, piano.
[9401.05s -> 9401.93s]  That's me.
[9401.93s -> 9403.05s]  It was genuine.
[9403.05s -> 9404.17s]  That was not genuine.
[9404.17s -> 9405.37s]  That was not genuine.
[9405.37s -> 9406.09s]  Can I redo it?
[9406.09s -> 9407.93s]  Can I take it again?
[9408.81s -> 9409.93s]  Cut this part.
[9409.93s -> 9410.57s]  Start.
[9410.57s -> 9411.61s]  Hmm, piano.
[9412.41s -> 9412.97s]  Wow.
[9412.97s -> 9414.73s]  I'm so sad that he didn't get through.
[9414.73s -> 9415.45s]  Wow, piano.
[9419.08s -> 9419.72s]  Everybody quiet.
[9420.68s -> 9421.48s]  Number 14, hi.
[9422.52s -> 9424.28s]  What are you going to do for us today?
[9424.28s -> 9425.48s]  I'm going to play the piano.
[9425.48s -> 9426.52s]  Wow.
[9426.52s -> 9428.44s]  Okay, let's see that one coming.
[9428.44s -> 9429.16s]  Don't listen to that.
[9429.16s -> 9431.72s]  You know, I'm actually named after a pianist myself.
[9431.72s -> 9432.44s]  What are you playing?
[9433.08s -> 9433.72s]  Oh, I get it.
[9433.72s -> 9434.04s]  Lude.
[9434.76s -> 9437.88s]  Number 14, the only person that matters on this stage is me.
[9437.88s -> 9438.52s]  Okay?
[9438.52s -> 9442.44s]  If I like what you're doing, I'm worth like a hundred votes.
[9442.44s -> 9444.28s]  These guys are just here for fucking fluff.
[9444.28s -> 9445.40s]  Don't listen to this bullshit.
[9446.36s -> 9447.64s]  You have a little bit of a thing that you,
[9448.20s -> 9450.20s]  a package presented to us, right?
[9450.20s -> 9451.32s]  He couldn't trust his own mind.
[9451.32s -> 9453.24s]  That's why we're here, to be clear.
[9453.24s -> 9454.36s]  We want to see the video first.
[9454.92s -> 9455.96s]  We'll watch the video first.
[9456.52s -> 9458.12s]  My name is Joseph Kostetsky.
[9458.12s -> 9463.24s]  I'm 29 and I've been running an arcade named Joseph's Palace for the past few years.
[9463.88s -> 9467.08s]  Ever since I was a young boy, I loved playing video games.
[9467.72s -> 9474.28s]  I remember I would play Marvel versus Capcom 2 with all my friends at my house
[9474.28s -> 9476.92s]  and we'd host tournaments.
[9476.92s -> 9481.16s]  I love doing this so much that I wanted to open my own arcade
[9481.16s -> 9483.88s]  and share my love of video games with the community.
[9484.52s -> 9488.04s]  However, with arcades becoming more and more obsolete,
[9488.04s -> 9490.52s]  I need a better way to promote my business.
[9490.52s -> 9493.80s]  And because Jerma's fan base is so large,
[9493.80s -> 9496.68s]  I think I can use this channel to really promote my arcade.
[9497.40s -> 9500.68s]  I found Jerma's just another guy who likes video games,
[9500.68s -> 9501.96s]  especially the older ones.
[9502.52s -> 9506.84s]  And I feel like that makes me a good candidate for this job.
[9509.85s -> 9510.65s]  Don't clap.
[9510.65s -> 9511.21s]  Don't clap.
[9511.21s -> 9511.93s]  That was beautiful.
[9513.37s -> 9514.81s]  So you own an arcade?
[9514.81s -> 9516.01s]  Yes, I own an arcade.
[9516.01s -> 9517.45s]  And how's that going for you so far?
[9518.17s -> 9518.81s]  Not so good.
[9518.81s -> 9519.53s]  That's why I'm here.
[9520.25s -> 9521.21s]  So what do you think?
[9521.21s -> 9524.25s]  We think that you come onto the show and get the channel and then...
[9524.97s -> 9528.01s]  Yes, convert it to some arcade players, right?
[9528.01s -> 9529.85s]  Would you stream arcade gameplay?
[9529.85s -> 9532.17s]  Well, I view it one in the same.
[9532.17s -> 9536.33s]  I feel like this channel can really be a sponsor for my arcade.
[9536.33s -> 9536.97s]  Okay.
[9536.97s -> 9538.73s]  You said Marvel vs. Capcom.
[9539.37s -> 9540.09s]  Any other games?
[9540.09s -> 9541.93s]  You ever play any Super Smash Brothers?
[9541.93s -> 9545.05s]  Super Smash Brothers is my absolute favorite game.
[9545.05s -> 9547.13s]  Would you play Destiny 2 PVP?
[9547.13s -> 9551.69s]  Stop saying that because people will use it and start writing it in chat all the time.
[9551.69s -> 9552.19s]  Okay.
[9552.89s -> 9553.77s]  What are you going to play for us?
[9554.97s -> 9556.41s]  I'm going to play the piano.
[9556.41s -> 9556.91s]  Okay.
[9557.63s -> 9559.07s]  Let's go ahead and let you do it.
[9562.51s -> 9564.03s]  This is the least interesting part of you.
[9571.31s -> 9572.99s]  Let's get back, because look at how good that...
[9575.55s -> 9576.43s]  So I can do it again.
[9597.69s -> 9624.83s]  Number 14, thank you so much.
[9624.83s -> 9625.55s]  That was phenomenal.
[9627.20s -> 9628.08s]  We're at an impasse.
[9629.29s -> 9631.37s]  We have two nos and two yeses.
[9632.09s -> 9635.93s]  I mean, you are the third piano guy.
[9635.93s -> 9636.33s]  Yes.
[9636.33s -> 9640.17s]  I could be convinced with an overhand Amadeus.
[9642.14s -> 9642.78s]  Over the top.
[9643.58s -> 9644.70s]  Amadeus, like the song?
[9644.70s -> 9645.90s]  No, like the movie.
[9645.90s -> 9649.10s]  In the movie Amadeus, he plays like this.
[9649.10s -> 9650.22s]  While he's drunk.
[9650.22s -> 9650.78s]  Oh, okay.
[9650.78s -> 9653.26s]  To show his skills as a virtuoso.
[9653.26s -> 9653.76s]  Yes.
[9656.30s -> 9657.90s]  To convince these two idiots,
[9658.70s -> 9660.06s]  could you do something else?
[9660.06s -> 9661.98s]  Something a little bit more of a fast pace, too?
[9661.98s -> 9666.46s]  Well, actually, my problem was it was a bit too fast.
[9666.94s -> 9668.70s]  Fur Elise was written for Elise,
[9669.42s -> 9672.30s]  and it was actually really supposed to be a tender loving song
[9672.30s -> 9675.18s]  that picked up at times like the heights of relationships,
[9675.18s -> 9677.26s]  but also slowed down like the lows.
[9677.26s -> 9677.58s]  Right.
[9677.58s -> 9680.81s]  And I didn't feel the passion come through, although the notes did.
[9680.81s -> 9681.45s]  Right.
[9681.45s -> 9683.05s]  What a beautiful story.
[9683.05s -> 9684.09s]  Oh, okay.
[9684.09s -> 9685.95s]  He's got a point.
[9685.95s -> 9686.67s]  Number 14.
[9688.08s -> 9690.32s]  That was a phenomenal, phenomenal time on the piano.
[9690.88s -> 9692.88s]  But after hearing from some of the judges...
[9692.88s -> 9694.72s]  I only know what video game music is.
[9694.72s -> 9695.28s]  What do you got?
[9696.24s -> 9698.48s]  He's played like 6,000 hours of Path of a Devil.
[9698.48s -> 9700.72s]  My favorite genre is video game music.
[9701.52s -> 9703.36s]  I don't understand what you're doing up there.
[9703.36s -> 9705.42s]  I'm just trying my best.
[9705.42s -> 9707.98s]  I think you got a great future ahead of you.
[9708.54s -> 9709.10s]  I just got...
[9709.10s -> 9712.22s]  I just don't really listen to it.
[9712.22s -> 9715.02s]  I thought that was quite lovely.
[9715.02s -> 9715.66s]  Quite lovely.
[9715.66s -> 9720.16s]  But I have a question for you that might make my decision.
[9721.53s -> 9726.09s]  Do you have a bone spur on the left interior of your right mandible?
[9727.53s -> 9732.28s]  I don't even know.
[9732.28s -> 9732.92s]  He's a liar.
[9737.74s -> 9738.62s]  Number 14.
[9738.62s -> 9739.42s]  I'm so sorry.
[9740.57s -> 9741.69s]  You got a great look.
[9741.69s -> 9743.05s]  I think you got the great look.
[9743.05s -> 9744.01s]  You got the look of the part.
[9744.01s -> 9748.33s]  But apparently having a piano is an automatic no from like two people.
[9748.33s -> 9749.61s]  But I don't want you to quit.
[9749.61s -> 9750.09s]  Okay?
[9750.09s -> 9750.49s]  What is it?
[9750.49s -> 9750.73s]  Who is it?
[9750.73s -> 9751.93s]  Joseph's Arcade.
[9751.93s -> 9753.85s]  Joseph's Arcade can be a big thing one day.
[9754.49s -> 9755.69s]  It can be a big thing one day.
[9755.69s -> 9756.49s]  I want you to know that.
[9756.49s -> 9757.13s]  No, I'm going to say yes.
[9757.13s -> 9757.85s]  Can you hear me?
[9757.85s -> 9758.89s]  Joseph's Arcade one day.
[9758.89s -> 9759.85s]  It's going to be huge.
[9759.85s -> 9763.05s]  Thank you just for the opportunity to get a chance to get out there.
[9763.05s -> 9763.93s]  Wait, what do we have right now?
[9763.93s -> 9765.93s]  Joseph's Arcade and piano lines.
[9765.93s -> 9768.49s]  They're going to be talking about your arcade in the big times.
[9768.49s -> 9769.45s]  We lost our monitor.
[9769.45s -> 9770.81s]  It's in the big leagues.
[9770.81s -> 9771.61s]  Okay, listen.
[9772.17s -> 9772.81s]  What do we have?
[9775.44s -> 9776.24s]  Thank you.
[9776.24s -> 9776.72s]  Thank you.
[9776.72s -> 9777.60s]  That was very, very nice.
[9777.60s -> 9778.40s]  Thank you very much.
[9778.40s -> 9778.96s]  Thank you.
[9778.96s -> 9780.40s]  All right, just stop fucking around.
[9781.12s -> 9781.68s]  Thank you.
[9781.68s -> 9783.84s]  Again, you were seriously such a great job.
[9783.84s -> 9785.44s]  You should have been the first player.
[9785.44s -> 9786.64s]  You just honestly.
[9786.64s -> 9787.20s]  Sorry.
[9787.20s -> 9788.40s]  It was the order.
[9788.40s -> 9788.88s]  Yeah.
[9788.88s -> 9789.76s]  It was a great job.
[9789.76s -> 9790.48s]  It really was.
[9790.48s -> 9792.08s]  It happened like that in Squid Game too.
[9792.08s -> 9793.68s]  But that was such a phenomenal piano player.
[9793.68s -> 9794.64s]  The order matters.
[9794.64s -> 9795.92s]  The order does matter, Jerma.
[9797.36s -> 9798.56s]  A good Jerma is lucky.
[9799.20s -> 9800.16s]  That's true.
[9800.16s -> 9800.64s]  What did you say?
[9800.64s -> 9801.60s]  What was my character?
[9801.60s -> 9804.48s]  You said I was like 10 luck and like five charisma.
[9804.48s -> 9804.88s]  Yeah.
[9804.88s -> 9807.20s]  15% power, 10% skill.
[9807.92s -> 9810.40s]  Okay, my D&D character was what?
[9810.40s -> 9811.44s]  Like if I were to make one.
[9811.44s -> 9816.40s]  I said you would put everything in charisma and everything else is a dump step.
[9816.40s -> 9816.90s]  Okay.
[9817.36s -> 9820.32s]  By the way, the Myriad is a great show going on.
[9820.32s -> 9821.12s]  It's Myriad.
[9821.76s -> 9822.40s]  Oh, fuck off.
[9822.40s -> 9823.12s]  You're not getting a plug.
[9824.00s -> 9825.04s]  Who's coming up next?
[9826.00s -> 9828.64s]  We got number 15, I think, coming up here.
[9828.64s -> 9829.14s]  Yeah.
[9829.92s -> 9831.12s]  15 should be running.
[9831.12s -> 9831.92s]  Getting down to it.
[9831.92s -> 9832.56s]  Getting down to it.
[9832.56s -> 9833.04s]  Getting down to it.
[9834.00s -> 9835.36s]  Number 15, go ahead and come on out.
[9835.36s -> 9836.64s]  We'll see what you got here.
[9838.80s -> 9839.52s]  You do hunch.
[9840.24s -> 9841.13s]  A little bit, yeah.
[9842.62s -> 9843.42s]  Hello, 15.
[9844.06s -> 9844.86s]  Hello.
[9844.86s -> 9845.66s]  I'll be clear.
[9845.66s -> 9846.70s]  Clear your exes, by the way.
[9846.70s -> 9847.58s]  How are you?
[9849.18s -> 9849.98s]  We're doing great.
[9849.98s -> 9850.70s]  How are you, 15?
[9851.26s -> 9858.76s]  15, what are you going to do for us today?
[9858.76s -> 9859.96s]  You got something?
[9859.96s -> 9862.36s]  No piano, by the way, so surfers can be happy.
[9862.36s -> 9866.36s]  It's difficult.
[9866.36s -> 9867.16s]  I like the fumbling.
[9867.16s -> 9869.08s]  The fumbling is like exactly what I was going to do.
[9869.08s -> 9870.92s]  I think it's just an introduction.
[9870.92s -> 9871.48s]  Can you hear me?
[9872.12s -> 9872.92s]  We can hear you, yeah.
[9872.92s -> 9873.42s]  Okay.
[9874.12s -> 9874.62s]  Hello.
[9875.08s -> 9876.12s]  Hey, 15, how are you?
[9876.12s -> 9877.16s]  Good afternoon.
[9878.52s -> 9887.32s]  My ability is doing slightly obscure impressions of people saying very specific things.
[9887.80s -> 9888.60s]  Okay.
[9888.60s -> 9890.52s]  Can you do any serial characters?
[9890.52s -> 9891.80s]  Serial characters?
[9891.80s -> 9893.32s]  Any serial mascots like...
[9894.36s -> 9895.16s]  Great!
[9896.28s -> 9897.08s]  That's a yes from me.
[9897.64s -> 9898.92s]  You don't need to impress me anymore.
[9898.92s -> 9900.84s]  That is Antonio the Tiger.
[9900.84s -> 9901.88s]  Yeah, that's very good.
[9903.80s -> 9904.84s]  Why do you have an accent now?
[9906.36s -> 9911.40s]  Before I was doing you, I've learned your voice, but I'm new here, so this is...
[9911.40s -> 9912.44s]  Oh, okay, so you have an accent.
[9912.44s -> 9913.72s]  It's more comfortable to speak.
[9913.72s -> 9914.44s]  Where are you from?
[9914.92s -> 9918.38s]  Um, from Stockton.
[9918.38s -> 9919.02s]  Stock...
[9919.02s -> 9919.66s]  Oh, Stockton.
[9919.66s -> 9920.16s]  Sweden.
[9920.94s -> 9921.66s]  California.
[9921.66s -> 9923.66s]  Oh, never mind.
[9923.66s -> 9924.16s]  Great.
[9924.70s -> 9925.74s]  You're from California, okay.
[9925.74s -> 9926.70s]  Stockton, California.
[9926.70s -> 9928.86s]  So what are you going to do exactly for us today?
[9929.50s -> 9934.62s]  The first one is a great Shakespearean actor, Peter O'Toole, doing...
[9936.08s -> 9936.58s]  Okay.
[9950.06s -> 9953.21s]  Nothing, darling, helps in my ride.
[9954.41s -> 9958.59s]  I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright.
[9958.59s -> 9962.27s]  We used to go around and fuck the hoes at night.
[9962.27s -> 9964.35s]  Take that, you motherfucking gangster bitch!
[9967.74s -> 9969.02s]  Why are there no other accents?
[9969.02s -> 9969.66s]  That is the...
[9970.30s -> 9971.66s]  Because it is his voice.
[9971.66s -> 9973.50s]  His voice, he doesn't speak with you.
[9973.50s -> 9974.14s]  Yeah, that's great.
[9975.02s -> 9975.58s]  That's great.
[9976.46s -> 9977.18s]  What else do you have?
[9978.14s -> 9984.94s]  Um, this is Harrison Ford going into store for Halloween candy.
[9984.94s -> 9985.44s]  Okay.
[9990.48s -> 9991.28s]  Bitter honey.
[9994.48s -> 9995.28s]  Blow pop!
[9998.00s -> 10000.60s]  Charleston shoe.
[10001.40s -> 10003.37s]  Just that one.
[10003.37s -> 10004.89s]  That was good, that was good, yeah.
[10004.89s -> 10005.61s]  Excellent.
[10005.61s -> 10006.11s]  Excellent.
[10007.85s -> 10009.53s]  Dateline Keith Morrison.
[10009.53s -> 10010.65s]  You watch Dateline?
[10012.01s -> 10012.81s]  Seldomly, yeah.
[10012.81s -> 10013.61s]  Seldom.
[10013.61s -> 10014.25s]  Oh, you are old.
[10014.25s -> 10015.05s]  This is Dateline.
[10015.05s -> 10016.01s]  He's 37 in this room.
[10016.01s -> 10020.89s]  Dateline host Keith Morrison describing genital warts syndrome.
[10020.89s -> 10021.61s]  Oh, god.
[10022.81s -> 10023.61s]  Somebody please spread that.
[10023.61s -> 10024.33s]  Genital warts.
[10026.33s -> 10028.25s]  Colored or whitish balls.
[10028.25s -> 10029.77s]  Show up on your vulva.
[10030.41s -> 10031.53s]  Vagina.
[10031.53s -> 10032.09s]  Servings.
[10032.09s -> 10033.85s]  Dr. Sports and Stiller, yes.
[10033.85s -> 10035.45s]  Scrooge or anus.
[10035.45s -> 10036.33s]  These are medical terms.
[10036.33s -> 10037.61s]  Sounds like Cave Johnson.
[10037.61s -> 10040.89s]  They kind of look a little like cauliflower.
[10040.89s -> 10043.93s]  That is from the actual website.
[10043.93s -> 10044.43s]  Okay.
[10049.84s -> 10050.48s]  Gary Busey.
[10050.48s -> 10052.32s]  You sort of look like the Gary Busey.
[10052.32s -> 10053.52s]  I've heard the Gary Busey.
[10053.52s -> 10054.56s]  Willem Dafoe, you know.
[10056.56s -> 10057.06s]  Oh, god.
[10059.56s -> 10060.44s]  I mean, my teeth.
[10060.44s -> 10061.16s]  I got big teeth.
[10061.16s -> 10061.66s]  Let's see.
[10062.76s -> 10064.12s]  I made that myself.
[10064.12s -> 10065.72s]  Wait, what is that?
[10065.72s -> 10066.22s]  Paper.
[10066.22s -> 10067.80s]  A piece of paper with Sharpie.
[10067.80s -> 10068.76s]  Oh, it's paper.
[10068.76s -> 10070.04s]  I thought it was actually fake teeth.
[10070.04s -> 10073.08s]  He looks like Jim Carrey from Donald Trump.
[10073.08s -> 10073.80s]  All right, all right.
[10073.80s -> 10075.00s]  The imposter is...
[10075.00s -> 10075.50s]  Shush!
[10076.52s -> 10077.16s]  I took it back.
[10077.16s -> 10077.72s]  I'm sorry.
[10077.72s -> 10078.60s]  You have to say no.
[10078.60s -> 10079.24s]  That was great.
[10079.96s -> 10081.80s]  Okay, this is a...
[10081.80s -> 10082.68s]  I'm close to a no.
[10082.68s -> 10085.40s]  Gary Busey is a Spanish instructor.
[10085.40s -> 10085.90s]  Okay.
[10098.27s -> 10099.31s]  I've been no for the whole time.
[10099.31s -> 10100.19s]  That was the bingo song.
[10100.19s -> 10101.15s]  I've been no the whole time.
[10101.15s -> 10101.79s]  I can't...
[10101.79s -> 10102.75s]  You know what?
[10102.75s -> 10103.79s]  Could I make a request?
[10104.43s -> 10106.11s]  Because, you know, at the end of the day,
[10106.11s -> 10106.91s]  impressions are great,
[10106.91s -> 10109.39s]  but Jerma really defaults to one always.
[10109.39s -> 10109.95s]  Yeah.
[10109.95s -> 10111.31s]  And it says Donald Trump.
[10112.68s -> 10113.56s]  Can you do a Donald?
[10113.56s -> 10114.84s]  Can you do a Donald Trump?
[10114.84s -> 10117.16s]  Could you do Donald Trump saying that
[10117.16s -> 10118.76s]  you're a better streamer than Jerma is?
[10119.72s -> 10120.20s]  What do we got?
[10120.20s -> 10120.70s]  One X?
[10120.70s -> 10122.60s]  You are, you are, or...
[10122.60s -> 10123.10s]  You...
[10123.10s -> 10123.56s]  Yeah, I'm a better...
[10123.56s -> 10124.20s]  Right, who are you?
[10124.20s -> 10125.24s]  You'd be Donald Trump.
[10125.24s -> 10127.40s]  You're a better streamer, better, better.
[10127.40s -> 10128.28s]  Okay, look it up.
[10128.28s -> 10128.84s]  It's true.
[10128.84s -> 10130.20s]  You're a better, better streamer.
[10131.00s -> 10131.50s]  It was on the...
[10133.80s -> 10134.36s]  Okay, okay.
[10134.36s -> 10135.08s]  It was on the spot.
[10135.96s -> 10137.80s]  Let me try and bring it to my side.
[10137.80s -> 10138.76s]  I'm a hundred percent yes.
[10138.76s -> 10141.32s]  Number one, a hundred percent yes.
[10141.32s -> 10143.08s]  To me, you're the next Jerma.
[10143.08s -> 10145.80s]  You had a serial mascot character.
[10146.36s -> 10147.16s]  That's a huge point.
[10147.16s -> 10148.12s]  That's like nine out of ten.
[10148.12s -> 10149.61s]  We're almost there.
[10149.61s -> 10151.53s]  All of your references are dated.
[10151.53s -> 10153.13s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[10153.13s -> 10154.81s]  I have not a single clue,
[10154.81s -> 10156.81s]  and that's the extra point to get to ten.
[10156.81s -> 10157.69s]  Oh, that's good.
[10157.69s -> 10158.09s]  You don't...
[10158.09s -> 10159.45s]  How do you not know Harrison Ford?
[10159.45s -> 10160.01s]  He's like still...
[10160.01s -> 10160.81s]  He was in the last season.
[10160.81s -> 10163.13s]  How do you not know Harrison Ford?
[10163.13s -> 10164.57s]  Harrison Ford's still making movies.
[10164.57s -> 10165.37s]  Oh, sure.
[10165.37s -> 10165.85s]  Yeah.
[10165.85s -> 10167.13s]  For like old women.
[10167.13s -> 10168.73s]  Okay, so what...
[10168.73s -> 10169.61s]  You're a yes.
[10170.33s -> 10171.05s]  Yes, completely.
[10171.05s -> 10173.58s]  I have something else you were going to say.
[10173.58s -> 10173.98s]  Can you do...
[10173.98s -> 10174.62s]  You're fantastic.
[10174.62s -> 10175.10s]  That's okay.
[10175.10s -> 10175.66s]  Can you do...
[10176.46s -> 10177.26s]  Can you do Yoda?
[10179.55s -> 10180.59s]  Yoda, I can do.
[10182.03s -> 10182.67s]  Shit, he can do...
[10182.67s -> 10186.27s]  I will take all of your exes back.
[10186.27s -> 10187.47s]  Yes, yes.
[10187.47s -> 10187.97s]  No.
[10189.95s -> 10191.63s]  Doctor, doctor, what do you think about this?
[10191.63s -> 10192.13s]  Well...
[10192.75s -> 10194.67s]  Smelling his fingers, he is.
[10194.67s -> 10195.23s]  I'm not...
[10195.23s -> 10196.83s]  My fingers are like out.
[10196.83s -> 10197.87s]  I'm gonna keep them here.
[10197.87s -> 10199.87s]  I'm not smelling my fingers.
[10199.87s -> 10200.35s]  They're...
[10200.35s -> 10201.71s]  I'm gonna keep them at the table for now on.
[10202.67s -> 10204.03s]  Doctor, what do you think?
[10205.31s -> 10206.35s]  Number 15.
[10208.73s -> 10210.89s]  I'm afraid it's gonna have to be a no, but
[10211.61s -> 10213.37s]  I thank you for your accuracy.
[10214.86s -> 10216.06s]  Number 15.
[10216.06s -> 10219.26s]  It looks like we've got three nos.
[10219.26s -> 10220.78s]  Please, I'm begging you.
[10220.78s -> 10222.54s]  You're the only one who can turn this.
[10222.54s -> 10225.42s]  Give me a one sentence pitch on why I should switch.
[10225.42s -> 10227.18s]  I think I gave some pretty good reasons.
[10228.36s -> 10230.84s]  I'm defaulting back to serial character.
[10230.84s -> 10232.20s]  All of his references are dated.
[10232.20s -> 10232.84s]  Just because you know what...
[10232.84s -> 10236.28s]  I think Jerm is intimidated by him being good at the stuff he's not good at.
[10236.28s -> 10236.76s]  Hey.
[10236.76s -> 10237.48s]  No, no.
[10237.48s -> 10239.64s]  Just because you know what a serial character is
[10239.64s -> 10241.00s]  does not mean that you should take over my channel.
[10241.00s -> 10241.50s]  Start.
[10242.38s -> 10243.18s]  You know what?
[10243.18s -> 10245.36s]  It's Ludwig.
[10245.36s -> 10246.46s]  Oh.
[10246.46s -> 10247.10s]  Sorry.
[10247.10s -> 10249.40s]  I didn't mean to tease you like that.
[10249.40s -> 10250.12s]  Number 15.
[10251.48s -> 10252.35s]  I'm so sorry.
[10252.35s -> 10252.85s]  Thank you.
[10255.36s -> 10256.80s]  I loved Tony the Tiger.
[10260.72s -> 10262.32s]  But just because you know what a serial character...
[10262.32s -> 10263.12s]  That doesn't mean you...
[10263.12s -> 10265.04s]  Oh, you know what Tony the Tiger is?
[10265.04s -> 10266.08s]  I think that was the last one.
[10266.08s -> 10267.60s]  Do what Tony the Tiger right now.
[10267.68s -> 10268.16s]  I can't.
[10268.16s -> 10268.80s]  15 was the last one.
[10270.80s -> 10272.00s]  I can't do it.
[10272.00s -> 10272.88s]  It's like Tony Tiger.
[10272.88s -> 10273.52s]  What do you mean?
[10273.52s -> 10274.16s]  That was the last one.
[10274.16s -> 10274.72s]  Are we at the end?
[10275.84s -> 10276.32s]  I'm blocked.
[10276.32s -> 10277.84s]  That was all 16 that...
[10279.20s -> 10279.60s]  What are you...
[10279.60s -> 10281.12s]  Wait, no, no, no, no.
[10281.12s -> 10281.92s]  What are you doing here?
[10281.92s -> 10282.56s]  Connor!
[10282.56s -> 10286.24s]  Hey, I know everybody's had chances when they come back.
[10286.24s -> 10286.72s]  Okay.
[10286.72s -> 10287.04s]  Maybe...
[10287.84s -> 10288.96s]  I don't have talent or anything.
[10288.96s -> 10289.36s]  No, no, no.
[10289.36s -> 10290.16s]  Go, go, go.
[10290.16s -> 10290.64s]  Connor, go.
[10290.64s -> 10292.48s]  Well, I can like...
[10292.48s -> 10292.88s]  I can like...
[10292.88s -> 10295.20s]  You got a chat and I can't read your chat.
[10295.20s -> 10295.52s]  Hit the fucking button.
[10295.52s -> 10296.96s]  You know, I can read your chat, Ludwig.
[10297.44s -> 10298.72s]  No, for sure, man.
[10298.72s -> 10299.60s]  Oh, is it red?
[10299.60s -> 10300.16s]  Oh.
[10300.16s -> 10301.28s]  Connor, you have your own...
[10301.28s -> 10301.92s]  Listen.
[10301.92s -> 10303.12s]  Play the sad music.
[10303.12s -> 10304.24s]  I'm 5'8 with shoes, dog.
[10304.24s -> 10304.96s]  Hey, hey, wait, wait.
[10304.96s -> 10305.84s]  Connor, stay right there.
[10305.84s -> 10306.88s]  Play the sad music, please.
[10307.84s -> 10310.33s]  Connor, you're a young guy
[10311.44s -> 10313.36s]  and you've got, I think, a great future in front of you.
[10313.92s -> 10315.12s]  I'm 37.
[10315.12s -> 10316.88s]  I'm 45 years older than you.
[10318.17s -> 10321.05s]  I think that you have a lot of comedy.
[10321.05s -> 10322.57s]  You have a lot of really good shticks
[10323.45s -> 10324.65s]  and I think you're a really nice guy.
[10325.45s -> 10327.61s]  But you ain't me and you never will be.
[10328.65s -> 10331.13s]  Be you and be the best you that you can be.
[10332.41s -> 10334.09s]  Is that one X or three?
[10334.09s -> 10334.49s]  It's all...
[10337.45s -> 10338.73s]  Connor, if you start crying anymore...
[10338.73s -> 10340.41s]  I don't know where we're going.
[10340.41s -> 10341.93s]  I think you've got a great future.
[10341.93s -> 10343.69s]  You're a really young, smart man
[10345.53s -> 10346.57s]  and like security...
[10346.57s -> 10348.01s]  I mean, I'm pretending to cry right now,
[10348.01s -> 10349.93s]  but like he should never have gotten up here.
[10349.93s -> 10351.69s]  He should have been removed immediately.
[10352.49s -> 10354.25s]  And we all cry on these shows.
[10356.57s -> 10358.01s]  Security should have taken him out immediately.
[10358.01s -> 10358.97s]  Sorry, it's tough.
[10359.85s -> 10360.97s]  Thank you for the opportunity.
[10360.97s -> 10362.73s]  Yeah, there was no opportunity in the first place.
[10362.73s -> 10363.77s]  You have Connor's pants.
[10363.77s -> 10364.41s]  Read the room.
[10364.41s -> 10366.97s]  You're your own channel.
[10366.97s -> 10368.49s]  You don't need another channel.
[10368.49s -> 10370.17s]  Unless you want to try your Yoda.
[10370.17s -> 10371.21s]  Oh, he's got a Yoda.
[10374.76s -> 10376.76s]  All right, we've got some more deliberation to do.
[10376.76s -> 10378.20s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[10378.20s -> 10381.80s]  I think I'm looking at the right camera for part three of Who Will...
[10382.28s -> 10382.68s]  I can't...
[10382.68s -> 10385.08s]  Who is gonna be German next?
[10385.08s -> 10385.64s]  Shut up.
[10386.36s -> 10388.01s]  Who will replace me?
[10388.01s -> 10389.77s]  You should call it German 986.
[10389.77s -> 10390.49s]  No.
[10390.49s -> 10392.33s]  Who will replace me?
[10392.33s -> 10393.93s]  Coming back soon in a few minutes.
[11090.14s -> 11286.76s]  Okay.
[11286.76s -> 11287.24s]  All right.
[11287.24s -> 11287.88s]  Okay.
[11287.88s -> 11288.38s]  Okay.
[11290.22s -> 11293.34s]  Seeing a little bit of people talk about number 15.
[11293.34s -> 11294.14s]  Seeing 15.
[11294.14s -> 11295.02s]  Bring 15 back.
[11295.02s -> 11295.74s]  Where's 15?
[11296.78s -> 11298.86s]  We had a deliberation.
[11299.58s -> 11300.78s]  We have four judges.
[11301.98s -> 11303.50s]  15 was eliminated.
[11304.38s -> 11306.30s]  And that's how you have to handle that.
[11306.94s -> 11307.50s]  15.
[11308.06s -> 11309.26s]  Impressions are one thing.
[11309.26s -> 11310.62s]  But demeanor.
[11310.62s -> 11311.50s]  Way that you talk.
[11311.50s -> 11312.22s]  Way that you act.
[11312.94s -> 11315.50s]  You can't just say, oh, 15 should go through.
[11315.50s -> 11316.30s]  He was a great guy.
[11316.30s -> 11317.10s]  He was really funny.
[11317.82s -> 11318.78s]  Oh, you say that now.
[11319.66s -> 11320.22s]  What?
[11320.22s -> 11322.38s]  You voted no, too?
[11322.38s -> 11323.58s]  Well, to tack on.
[11323.58s -> 11324.54s]  Doc Dreamer memory.
[11325.10s -> 11328.62s]  You were talking about how he medically just doesn't even line up.
[11328.62s -> 11330.62s]  Medically, he has bone spurs, I heard.
[11333.64s -> 11334.36s]  Here's the thing.
[11335.00s -> 11342.03s]  Um, in order to play Jeremy, he has to have the physical as well as the-
[11342.03s -> 11342.51s]  Exactly.
[11343.55s -> 11345.23s]  Listen to the doctor, for God's sakes.
[11345.23s -> 11346.11s]  He's a doctor.
[11346.11s -> 11346.59s]  Well-
[11346.59s -> 11347.95s]  Well, they're probably Americans.
[11347.95s -> 11348.51s]  They don't do that.
[11350.03s -> 11350.43s]  Yeah.
[11350.43s -> 11358.43s]  And I mean, obviously, the thing to match Jeremy is just be a total maniac.
[11359.71s -> 11362.99s]  But, you know, on the other side, you have to survive him.
[11363.79s -> 11364.43s]  What do you mean?
[11364.43s -> 11366.03s]  You mean like I'm a funny guy, right?
[11366.03s -> 11367.47s]  Like surviving Jerma?
[11368.27s -> 11368.67s]  Yeah, I know.
[11368.67s -> 11369.23s]  I know that sounds difficult.
[11369.23s -> 11370.03s]  What do you mean maniac?
[11370.83s -> 11371.95s]  A total loony.
[11371.95s -> 11372.59s]  Yeah, total-
[11372.59s -> 11374.11s]  No, you mean like a wacko guy.
[11374.11s -> 11374.75s]  Wacko job.
[11375.39s -> 11375.79s]  Yeah.
[11375.79s -> 11376.27s]  Oh, okay.
[11376.27s -> 11376.67s]  All right.
[11376.67s -> 11377.15s]  Super mean.
[11377.15s -> 11378.11s]  15 is gone.
[11378.67s -> 11379.55s]  He was funny.
[11379.55s -> 11384.43s]  He was nice, but maybe didn't have what it took to be the next Jerboff.
[11384.43s -> 11384.99s]  985.
[11385.71s -> 11390.91s]  So what we're going to do now to narrow it down even more, we have to be certain.
[11391.79s -> 11398.19s]  The final round until you, yes, you, vote for who is the next Jerma 985.
[11398.83s -> 11401.15s]  We're going to bring out the contestants that we passed through,
[11401.87s -> 11404.75s]  and they are going to read a very important passage.
[11405.55s -> 11408.19s]  The JermaCraft copypasta passage.
[11409.16s -> 11412.12s]  However they do it, we are going to vote for it.
[11412.12s -> 11416.36s]  How well they do it, how smartly, how energetically,
[11416.92s -> 11418.44s]  we are going to vote for them as well.
[11419.16s -> 11421.48s]  This is the final round to the final.
[11421.48s -> 11423.16s]  Whoever goes through this round-
[11423.16s -> 11424.20s]  It's not the final round.
[11426.04s -> 11428.60s]  It's the final round for us.
[11428.60s -> 11431.00s]  And then you get to decide who wins.
[11431.64s -> 11433.88s]  We are going to narrow this down to three.
[11433.88s -> 11436.12s]  To be clear, you can't decide 15 wins.
[11437.32s -> 11438.76s]  The penultimate round is here.
[11438.76s -> 11439.40s]  Let's, let's see.
[11442.76s -> 11447.24s]  Guys, can we please bring out number one to read the JermaCraft copypasta
[11447.24s -> 11448.76s]  to see if they have what it takes.
[11449.40s -> 11451.32s]  Yeah, I just want to see you read the ancient text.
[11451.32s -> 11452.04s]  Hello.
[11452.04s -> 11452.52s]  Hello.
[11452.52s -> 11453.24s]  Welcome back.
[11453.24s -> 11454.75s]  Hello.
[11454.75s -> 11458.51s]  Why do you have like a, like a, like a water, like office water?
[11458.51s -> 11459.31s]  It's like a Dixie cup.
[11459.87s -> 11460.83s]  It's cider.
[11460.83s -> 11461.71s]  It's cider, okay.
[11463.52s -> 11465.52s]  Are you ready to read the JermaCraft copypasta?
[11465.52s -> 11468.08s]  Number one, you've made it this far, are you ready?
[11468.08s -> 11470.00s]  Is it an iPhone 12 Max or 11 Max?
[11470.00s -> 11473.28s]  Don't say that iPhone, who cares, Android, doesn't matter.
[11474.00s -> 11476.73s]  It's a private sponsorship I have.
[11476.73s -> 11477.29s]  Shut up.
[11478.94s -> 11480.70s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[11480.70s -> 11486.70s]  Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[11486.70s -> 11489.34s]  This is going to be a single player let's play.
[11489.34s -> 11495.66s]  And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[11495.66s -> 11496.86s]  You're going to see lots of fails.
[11496.86s -> 11499.90s]  You're going to see lots of triumphs, at least a moment.
[11499.90s -> 11503.34s]  So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[11503.34s -> 11505.58s]  I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[11505.58s -> 11506.38s]  Let me take a sip.
[11508.30s -> 11509.34s]  That is some good cider.
[11510.70s -> 11511.74s]  You said that?
[11511.74s -> 11513.74s]  You said that's some good cider.
[11513.74s -> 11514.38s]  He nailed it.
[11515.18s -> 11515.66s]  You nailed it.
[11515.66s -> 11516.30s]  That was amazing.
[11517.10s -> 11518.06s]  Oh, you nailed it.
[11518.06s -> 11519.98s]  Man, I would not watch you play Minecraft.
[11520.62s -> 11521.42s]  Why would you play?
[11521.42s -> 11523.34s]  Why would you watch me play Minecraft?
[11523.34s -> 11524.78s]  It's a fucking horrible content.
[11524.78s -> 11528.86s]  I mean, either of you, based on what I just heard, I'm not watching either of you.
[11528.86s -> 11530.30s]  If you, okay, wait, wait, number one.
[11530.30s -> 11530.86s]  Yes.
[11530.86s -> 11531.98s]  If you took over.
[11531.98s -> 11532.62s]  Yes.
[11532.62s -> 11535.66s]  What would be your number one video game to play on the first day?
[11538.11s -> 11539.39s]  Minecraft, maybe?
[11539.39s -> 11540.91s]  No, no, I don't want to press it.
[11540.91s -> 11541.55s]  I don't want to press it.
[11542.43s -> 11543.31s]  Say anything else.
[11543.31s -> 11544.27s]  Number one, please.
[11544.27s -> 11545.23s]  You get a redo.
[11545.23s -> 11546.19s]  It's a really good question.
[11546.99s -> 11549.07s]  Don't say Dark Souls either, because nobody got through them too early.
[11549.07s -> 11549.63s]  Call of Duty?
[11549.63s -> 11550.35s]  I'm just kidding.
[11550.35s -> 11551.31s]  Don't say that either.
[11551.31s -> 11552.03s]  It's a good gag.
[11552.83s -> 11553.63s]  But for real though, now.
[11553.63s -> 11556.91s]  If the brand were to live forever and you took it on.
[11556.91s -> 11558.83s]  Geez, you know.
[11558.83s -> 11559.79s]  First game you'd play.
[11560.67s -> 11561.63s]  Death's Door.
[11561.63s -> 11563.23s]  Holy shit, that's a pass for me.
[11563.95s -> 11564.91s]  I don't even know what that is.
[11566.35s -> 11567.87s]  You got to play Death's Door.
[11567.87s -> 11568.59s]  The bird?
[11568.59s -> 11568.99s]  Why?
[11568.99s -> 11569.55s]  The bird.
[11569.55s -> 11570.03s]  The bird.
[11570.91s -> 11571.39s]  So good.
[11572.35s -> 11573.31s]  That's the bird, yeah.
[11573.87s -> 11574.75s]  You know what this is?
[11574.75s -> 11575.31s]  Yeah.
[11575.31s -> 11576.27s]  What's Death's Door?
[11576.27s -> 11579.55s]  You're a bird and it's like a roguelike and you got to go around and.
[11579.55s -> 11581.39s]  Made by the guys that made Titan Souls.
[11581.39s -> 11582.27s]  I don't know if you ever played that.
[11582.27s -> 11584.11s]  Yeah, you're kind of like a Reaper bird.
[11584.11s -> 11584.51s]  Chat.
[11585.31s -> 11587.31s]  It wasn't made 40 years ago so you might have missed it.
[11587.31s -> 11588.67s]  Or Nobody Saves the World.
[11588.67s -> 11590.51s]  That's another one maybe I would play.
[11590.51s -> 11591.15s]  Heard of this one?
[11591.15s -> 11591.23s]  Number one.
[11591.23s -> 11593.07s]  Jeremy's known for a lot of his bigger streams.
[11593.07s -> 11596.51s]  What big ideas would you bring to the table in 2022 and 2023?
[11596.51s -> 11596.83s]  Exactly.
[11596.83s -> 11598.83s]  Wow, that's really putting me on the spot.
[11599.79s -> 11608.35s]  Let's see, maybe how about while I would be playing I would also be getting a massage.
[11608.35s -> 11610.43s]  That's actually pretty funny.
[11610.43s -> 11611.71s]  Yeah, okay.
[11611.71s -> 11612.35s]  He goes through.
[11612.35s -> 11614.11s]  Okay, are we all getting a question?
[11614.11s -> 11617.23s]  I think if you have a question to ask him that's fine.
[11617.23s -> 11617.71s]  That's funny.
[11617.71s -> 11618.51s]  That's actually funny.
[11619.95s -> 11620.75s]  That's funny.
[11620.75s -> 11625.63s]  If you could approve upon one thing the current Jerma might not excel at,
[11625.63s -> 11627.24s]  where do you think you could do better?
[11627.24s -> 11630.08s]  I don't think I would stutter as much.
[11630.08s -> 11630.96s]  Oh, shit.
[11631.04s -> 11633.44s]  Okay, I am getting close to pressing the button.
[11633.44s -> 11634.16s]  Hey, they asked.
[11634.16s -> 11634.80s]  You know, I'm sorry.
[11634.80s -> 11636.32s]  I just did not ask much.
[11636.32s -> 11638.24s]  I was still, you know, stuttering like a little.
[11639.04s -> 11639.52s]  That was good.
[11639.52s -> 11639.92s]  I like that.
[11639.92s -> 11644.88s]  I want a look at me and I want it good and I want it now.
[11647.18s -> 11647.74s]  Look at me.
[11650.49s -> 11650.97s]  He goes on.
[11653.23s -> 11655.63s]  Welcome to the final round number one.
[11655.63s -> 11656.11s]  Fuck yeah.
[11656.99s -> 11657.55s]  Love that guy.
[11657.55s -> 11659.39s]  If number one goes on to the final.
[11659.39s -> 11661.95s]  So let the first guy go through but he just did so well.
[11661.95s -> 11662.59s]  It was so good.
[11663.55s -> 11664.51s]  It was actually very good.
[11665.47s -> 11667.31s]  I'm going to hit the next guy with harder questions.
[11667.31s -> 11667.71s]  Please do.
[11667.71s -> 11668.35s]  Tougher questions.
[11669.31s -> 11671.45s]  So number two we got coming out here.
[11671.45s -> 11672.81s]  We have a package for number two.
[11673.77s -> 11676.33s]  I guess some life story or something we have to hear.
[11677.13s -> 11679.77s]  Like all these shows do, you hear their fucking life story.
[11679.77s -> 11680.17s]  Great.
[11680.17s -> 11682.81s]  Can't wait to hear their life story and everybody cry.
[11684.01s -> 11684.57s]  Go ahead and play it.
[11686.67s -> 11689.95s]  I'm Austin S. Faulkner and I've been running a farm for the last 30 years
[11689.95s -> 11690.83s]  down in the heart of the country.
[11691.39s -> 11693.63s]  I come from a long lineage of farmers and we've owned this
[11693.63s -> 11695.95s]  plot of land for the last 200 years.
[11695.95s -> 11700.11s]  Running it with my wife Abby and my two sons Gregory and Johnny has been an
[11700.11s -> 11701.55s]  absolute joy.
[11701.55s -> 11704.99s]  Gregory, my youngest, absolutely loves this guy.
[11704.99s -> 11710.43s]  Shouting phrases like look at me and muck my ass at the dinner table.
[11710.43s -> 11714.67s]  I don't quite know what that means but my son keeps telling me that this guy's a
[11714.67s -> 11718.27s]  millionaire saying things like this on the internet every week.
[11718.27s -> 11722.59s]  Teaching today's youth how to properly run a farm through my streaming would be
[11722.59s -> 11727.63s]  a dream come true and I heard that German's retiring so I feel like I'm
[11727.63s -> 11739.85s]  right now in a good job.
[11739.85s -> 11741.13s]  Okay, so let's go ahead.
[11741.13s -> 11741.61s]  All right.
[11742.41s -> 11743.98s]  Let's bring our number two.
[11743.98s -> 11745.82s]  Number two, welcome to the stream.
[11745.82s -> 11746.38s]  How are you?
[11746.38s -> 11747.42s]  Welcome for the third time.
[11747.42s -> 11748.14s]  I'm doing well.
[11749.18s -> 11749.90s]  You got a farm.
[11749.90s -> 11751.18s]  We just heard about that.
[11751.18s -> 11752.14s]  Yeah, it's a beautiful farm.
[11752.14s -> 11753.26s]  You should come visit sometime.
[11753.26s -> 11753.90s]  I would love to.
[11753.90s -> 11754.54s]  You're retiring, right?
[11754.54s -> 11755.66s]  Hey, fresh milk?
[11755.66s -> 11757.26s]  We can trade spots.
[11757.26s -> 11757.98s]  You could run the farm.
[11757.98s -> 11758.78s]  I could run your channel.
[11759.58s -> 11760.38s]  Hey, that's easy.
[11760.38s -> 11762.06s]  25% goes to me.
[11762.06s -> 11764.38s]  Are you not concerned how the farm would end up
[11764.38s -> 11765.58s]  if Jerma were in control?
[11767.10s -> 11770.70s]  I think there'd be a lot of more muck-a-ass on the farm.
[11770.70s -> 11774.30s]  That's true.
[11774.30s -> 11775.10s]  He said muck-a-ass.
[11775.10s -> 11776.22s]  Everybody likes him.
[11776.22s -> 11776.86s]  Everybody likes him.
[11776.86s -> 11777.58s]  He said muck-a-ass.
[11777.58s -> 11778.54s]  Do the Pog face.
[11779.26s -> 11779.98s]  Well, no.
[11779.98s -> 11780.94s]  That's not even close.
[11780.94s -> 11781.50s]  Ew.
[11781.50s -> 11782.46s]  No, you didn't like that?
[11782.46s -> 11783.26s]  Okay.
[11783.26s -> 11784.22s]  I really didn't like that.
[11784.22s -> 11785.10s]  Did you say no?
[11786.62s -> 11786.94s]  Sorry.
[11786.94s -> 11789.44s]  Anyway, if you want to do your monologue.
[11789.44s -> 11791.44s]  Can we please hear JermaCraft copypasta, please?
[11792.08s -> 11793.52s]  And it better be fucking good.
[11794.32s -> 11796.00s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[11796.00s -> 11799.12s]  And welcome to the very first episode of JermaCraft,
[11799.12s -> 11801.44s]  the series where I play Minecraft.
[11801.44s -> 11804.40s]  Now, this is going to be a single player let's play.
[11804.40s -> 11808.40s]  And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely.
[11808.40s -> 11810.96s]  I'll pull it back.
[11810.96s -> 11812.56s]  Because I'm an idiot in this game.
[11813.28s -> 11816.24s]  Now, you're going to see a lot of fails and a lot of triumphs,
[11816.24s -> 11817.20s]  I am hoping.
[11817.20s -> 11820.56s]  So grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[11820.64s -> 11823.68s]  I got a glass of apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[11824.48s -> 11825.28s]  Let me take a sip.
[11827.28s -> 11830.48s]  That's a really good fake sip noise.
[11832.08s -> 11833.68s]  That was a good sip noise.
[11833.68s -> 11834.18s]  All right.
[11834.64s -> 11835.12s]  Thank you.
[11835.68s -> 11836.24s]  Thank you.
[11836.24s -> 11837.60s]  That was a very good sip noise.
[11838.16s -> 11838.48s]  Thank you.
[11838.48s -> 11839.12s]  I appreciate that.
[11839.12s -> 11839.60s]  I worked hard.
[11839.60s -> 11840.08s]  What do we got?
[11840.08s -> 11841.36s]  We got two and two here.
[11841.36s -> 11842.40s]  Can I field a question?
[11842.40s -> 11843.28s]  I would love to field a question.
[11844.16s -> 11847.04s]  I think a lot of Jerma's content revolves around creative ideas.
[11847.68s -> 11850.56s]  What would you do about the situation in Ukraine right now?
[11850.56s -> 11851.28s]  Jesus Christ.
[11852.80s -> 11855.68s]  It's kind of a touchy subject, but...
[11856.40s -> 11857.84s]  Just say, look at me, and it'll be fine.
[11857.84s -> 11859.36s]  Yeah, I'll just say, look at me.
[11860.56s -> 11860.80s]  No.
[11862.08s -> 11862.96s]  That's what you do?
[11862.96s -> 11864.40s]  You go to Ukraine, you go, look at me.
[11865.04s -> 11865.92s]  Look at me.
[11865.92s -> 11867.68s]  Distracted from all their problems now.
[11867.68s -> 11868.08s]  You know what?
[11868.08s -> 11869.84s]  Biden and Putin kiss in harmony.
[11870.64s -> 11871.12s]  Oh, boy.
[11872.64s -> 11873.72s]  Yeah.
[11873.72s -> 11875.16s]  I thought so, please.
[11875.16s -> 11876.84s]  Doctor, I think he's got what it takes.
[11876.84s -> 11880.76s]  Well, I'm sure that he's arrived farm fresh.
[11881.88s -> 11888.89s]  I do think that you have talent.
[11889.69s -> 11893.29s]  I just don't know if it's the kind of idiocy that we need.
[11893.29s -> 11894.33s]  Oh, no.
[11896.11s -> 11897.15s]  What the fuck?
[11897.15s -> 11899.95s]  Yeah, I'm going to remain a no based on your foreign policy.
[11899.95s -> 11900.19s]  No.
[11901.71s -> 11902.91s]  Well, I tried.
[11902.91s -> 11905.95s]  Number two, you were such a great presence.
[11906.51s -> 11907.63s]  You guys don't know anything.
[11907.63s -> 11908.35s]  What do you know about me?
[11908.35s -> 11909.87s]  We got to eliminate someone, all right?
[11909.87s -> 11912.59s]  And this guy's just walking around, look at me, like anyone can do it.
[11912.59s -> 11913.55s]  Am I the next Jerma?
[11913.55s -> 11914.51s]  Can I chime in?
[11915.15s -> 11917.23s]  This man's 36 with no kids.
[11917.23s -> 11917.71s]  Yeah.
[11917.71s -> 11920.27s]  You have a future ahead of you and it's your family.
[11920.83s -> 11924.35s]  There's a reason he's able to do this at 36 because he doesn't have one.
[11925.23s -> 11930.12s]  So we want someone who comes in to also not have a family that is more important.
[11930.84s -> 11934.51s]  I don't want to be tied down with real world issues.
[11935.23s -> 11936.59s]  You got to play video games all day.
[11937.47s -> 11938.59s]  What a loser would do.
[11939.39s -> 11939.95s]  You're a winner.
[11940.99s -> 11941.55s]  Thank you.
[11941.55s -> 11942.35s]  I appreciate that.
[11943.31s -> 11943.95s]  God bless.
[11943.95s -> 11944.43s]  Thanks for coming.
[11944.43s -> 11945.23s]  Have a good one.
[11945.23s -> 11946.51s]  Number two, thank you so much.
[11946.51s -> 11947.71s]  Here you go, keep that bill coming.
[11947.71s -> 11949.79s]  I feel great right now.
[11949.79s -> 11950.75s]  What a great feeling.
[11950.75s -> 11952.19s]  What happened to the kids?
[11952.19s -> 11953.63s]  What a great feeling.
[11953.63s -> 11957.71s]  I got 10 years on everybody at this table besides, of course, the wonderful doctor.
[11959.07s -> 11961.63s]  It depends on what you mean 10 years on.
[11961.63s -> 11962.11s]  It's true.
[11962.83s -> 11964.75s]  You're going to take 10 years from all of us.
[11965.55s -> 11965.95s]  All right.
[11967.23s -> 11969.95s]  I don't have kids, but you know, I'm thinking, I'm thinking about it.
[11969.95s -> 11970.67s]  I'm thinking.
[11970.67s -> 11972.75s]  I don't have kids, so I can spend a few in jail.
[11972.75s -> 11974.99s]  One day, you know, I'm 36, 37 this year.
[11974.99s -> 11976.99s]  You know, you think about kids, one day, one day.
[11977.63s -> 11978.51s]  One day.
[11978.51s -> 11979.87s]  Maybe we can have one soon.
[11979.87s -> 11982.75s]  Get your hands off of me before I switch seats with...
[11983.87s -> 11986.19s]  Turn your ex off before we get in trouble by production.
[11986.83s -> 11987.87s]  All right, number four.
[11987.87s -> 11990.43s]  Please come out, number four, for your German craft copybasta.
[11991.23s -> 11994.86s]  What's cat dog?
[11994.86s -> 11995.90s]  It's cat dog.
[11995.90s -> 12000.99s]  You, okay, before you go, everybody has put you through but me.
[12000.99s -> 12001.55s]  Yeah.
[12001.55s -> 12007.31s]  And you're doing like a really like caveman interpretation of my channel and me and...
[12007.31s -> 12008.67s]  It's so true.
[12008.67s -> 12010.83s]  I don't, I don't think that's like appropriate.
[12010.83s -> 12012.43s]  I don't think I'm that stupid.
[12012.43s -> 12013.95s]  But you made it all the way to the final.
[12013.95s -> 12015.63s]  I don't think you're stupid.
[12015.63s -> 12016.35s]  Do you think I'm stupid?
[12016.35s -> 12017.79s]  I don't think you're stupid.
[12017.79s -> 12018.67s]  What do you think I am?
[12018.67s -> 12019.71s]  I think you're very smart.
[12020.27s -> 12020.43s]  Okay.
[12020.43s -> 12022.11s]  It's like Joaquin Phoenix in showbiz.
[12022.11s -> 12022.75s]  I like you.
[12026.19s -> 12026.75s]  Number four.
[12028.03s -> 12028.35s]  Oops.
[12029.15s -> 12032.03s]  Can you give us a German craft copybasta, please?
[12033.31s -> 12034.75s]  If I may, please.
[12035.55s -> 12037.07s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[12037.07s -> 12040.19s]  Welcome to episode one of German craft.
[12040.19s -> 12042.91s]  This is the series where I play Minecraft.
[12042.91s -> 12045.47s]  This is a single player let's play.
[12045.47s -> 12051.39s]  And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[12051.39s -> 12052.75s]  You're going to see lots of fails.
[12052.75s -> 12054.91s]  You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[12054.91s -> 12055.71s]  At least I'm hoping.
[12056.35s -> 12059.47s]  So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[12059.47s -> 12061.39s]  I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[12061.39s -> 12062.11s]  Let me take a ship.
[12067.79s -> 12068.91s]  I thought he was pretty good.
[12068.91s -> 12069.79s]  Let me take a ship.
[12070.59s -> 12071.71s]  Yeah, but he's got a mic.
[12071.71s -> 12072.59s]  He's got a microphone in his hand.
[12072.59s -> 12073.55s]  He's Sean Connery.
[12073.55s -> 12074.27s]  Was it take?
[12075.15s -> 12075.71s]  Nevermind.
[12075.71s -> 12076.35s]  Was it?
[12076.35s -> 12076.67s]  Was it?
[12076.67s -> 12077.47s]  What?
[12077.47s -> 12078.51s]  No way.
[12078.51s -> 12078.99s]  No way.
[12078.99s -> 12081.87s]  You don't put this guy all the way through and then get him out in the last round.
[12081.87s -> 12083.23s]  There was no dog bark.
[12083.23s -> 12084.03s]  Where was the meow?
[12084.03s -> 12085.39s]  I thought it was a ship.
[12085.39s -> 12086.35s]  No, it's not a ship.
[12086.35s -> 12087.87s]  But you're actually pretty good.
[12087.87s -> 12089.07s]  You're actually really good.
[12089.07s -> 12090.91s]  I don't know if I agree with these three.
[12090.91s -> 12092.11s]  OK, so I'm sorry.
[12092.11s -> 12093.39s]  We wanted to get him through.
[12093.39s -> 12094.59s]  You whined and kvecht.
[12094.59s -> 12095.63s]  Now we want to eliminate him.
[12095.63s -> 12096.83s]  And you're whining and kvechting.
[12096.83s -> 12098.83s]  Do you want us to judge or do you want to tell us what to do?
[12098.83s -> 12101.23s]  That was a good German craft coffee pasta.
[12101.23s -> 12102.60s]  Hit it with some questions.
[12102.60s -> 12103.00s]  Tell me.
[12103.00s -> 12103.24s]  OK.
[12103.24s -> 12103.72s]  Convince me.
[12105.28s -> 12106.16s]  If you were...
[12106.88s -> 12111.12s]  OK, so you're in line at the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru.
[12111.68s -> 12112.72s]  You're number four in line.
[12112.72s -> 12113.92s]  That's a good question.
[12113.92s -> 12114.48s]  Good question.
[12114.48s -> 12115.52s]  That's a good question.
[12115.52s -> 12116.88s]  You're number four in line.
[12116.88s -> 12117.76s]  You're at Dunkin' Donuts.
[12117.76s -> 12118.32s]  You're at Donkeys.
[12118.96s -> 12123.68s]  You want a large iced blueberry with easy ice.
[12124.56s -> 12125.68s]  You're number four in line.
[12126.70s -> 12132.06s]  Do you, when you get to the counter, are you happy or are you sad?
[12132.06s -> 12135.90s]  How do you interact with the barista at Dunkin' Donuts?
[12136.86s -> 12138.06s]  Not what I thought the question would be.
[12139.66s -> 12141.34s]  I just spit everywhere.
[12141.34s -> 12142.14s]  Say it, don't spray it.
[12142.70s -> 12143.02s]  Sad.
[12143.74s -> 12144.30s]  You're sad.
[12144.30s -> 12144.54s]  Why?
[12144.54s -> 12145.34s]  Sad.
[12145.34s -> 12146.62s]  Because I'm number four.
[12147.50s -> 12150.06s]  All I've ever wanted to be is number one in Germany.
[12150.94s -> 12156.08s]  And I'm sad for the blueberries because the blueberries didn't have to die for me.
[12157.12s -> 12157.84s]  Why are they dying?
[12157.84s -> 12158.80s]  They deserve to live.
[12158.80s -> 12159.92s]  Why are you saying right?
[12159.92s -> 12160.24s]  OK.
[12161.28s -> 12163.84s]  And I'm sad that they would serve it to me.
[12163.84s -> 12165.20s]  That they would agree to serve it to me.
[12165.20s -> 12167.76s]  But wait, would you drink the whole thing in an hour?
[12168.56s -> 12169.04s]  Fuck yeah.
[12172.84s -> 12174.36s]  It takes me six hours to drink coffee.
[12175.45s -> 12177.53s]  I drink a full coffee in about six or seven hours.
[12177.53s -> 12178.09s]  That is true.
[12178.09s -> 12179.45s]  Also, what was the whole blueberry thing?
[12179.45s -> 12180.57s]  Are we going to just glaze over that?
[12180.57s -> 12182.17s]  Are you sad for the blueberries?
[12182.17s -> 12183.45s]  But I mean, you harvest them.
[12183.45s -> 12183.93s]  You take them.
[12183.93s -> 12185.05s]  You take their lives, you know?
[12185.05s -> 12185.29s]  No.
[12185.93s -> 12187.05s]  You take their lives.
[12187.05s -> 12187.69s]  I don't.
[12187.69s -> 12188.81s]  I mean, sir, you're a vegan.
[12188.81s -> 12191.93s]  Sorry, doctor, do blueberries have sentient lives?
[12193.37s -> 12195.23s]  I think they're plants.
[12196.19s -> 12206.67s]  And I have to tell you that, you know, I don't know if you are able to go through for me.
[12206.67s -> 12208.27s]  I'd love to send you through.
[12208.27s -> 12209.15s]  You know what I can do?
[12209.63s -> 12212.11s]  I can actually give you a referral for therapy.
[12213.64s -> 12214.14s]  Yeah.
[12214.84s -> 12215.40s]  If you need it.
[12216.04s -> 12220.12s]  I'll be right back here in the back of the stage after the show.
[12220.12s -> 12220.62s]  Okay.
[12221.24s -> 12222.12s]  That's great.
[12222.12s -> 12222.84s]  Okay, sir.
[12222.84s -> 12223.40s]  Yeah, sorry.
[12224.68s -> 12226.12s]  So that's one, two.
[12226.12s -> 12227.00s]  Doctor, is that a no?
[12230.28s -> 12230.76s]  There it is.
[12231.56s -> 12233.00s]  Okay, I was confused.
[12233.00s -> 12233.64s]  Number four.
[12233.64s -> 12234.68s]  Oh, okay, all four.
[12234.68s -> 12235.40s]  I don't know.
[12235.40s -> 12237.16s]  You're, I think you're out.
[12237.16s -> 12238.68s]  Number four, I think that's always need to see.
[12240.20s -> 12240.92s]  I got it.
[12240.92s -> 12241.48s]  I'm sorry.
[12241.48s -> 12242.04s]  I'm sorry.
[12242.04s -> 12242.92s]  Motherfucker.
[12242.92s -> 12243.64s]  Don't pray.
[12244.28s -> 12245.64s]  But don't be so mad.
[12245.64s -> 12247.48s]  By the way, my car is not in the parking lot.
[12247.48s -> 12249.40s]  So don't like, it's unhinged.
[12249.40s -> 12250.76s]  My car is not in the parking lot.
[12252.28s -> 12253.72s]  I think his car is in the parking lot.
[12253.72s -> 12259.56s]  If you want to key his, he's got a green sedan and it's got a vanity plate.
[12259.56s -> 12261.72s]  It says a path of exile.
[12262.60s -> 12266.28s]  Do you know like two things about me and one of them is not even true?
[12267.08s -> 12269.16s]  I don't, I don't have a driver's license.
[12271.15s -> 12273.63s]  Oh, you brought me on because I've known you for so long.
[12273.63s -> 12274.75s]  I know you better than anyone.
[12274.75s -> 12275.71s]  Those are the path of exile license plate.
[12275.71s -> 12276.21s]  Who am I?
[12277.87s -> 12280.51s]  Can we, can we bring out number eight, please?
[12280.51s -> 12281.87s]  Eight should be coming out right now.
[12281.87s -> 12284.67s]  You have the big suss guy license plate with your Jeep Wrangler.
[12286.73s -> 12288.24s]  Number eight.
[12290.72s -> 12291.28s]  Yeah.
[12291.28s -> 12292.32s]  All right, there it is.
[12292.32s -> 12292.80s]  All right.
[12292.80s -> 12293.76s]  Made it all the way to here.
[12295.04s -> 12297.44s]  Hi, number eight.
[12297.44s -> 12298.16s]  Welcome back.
[12298.16s -> 12298.66s]  Hello.
[12299.44s -> 12300.08s]  Hello.
[12300.16s -> 12303.52s]  We are ready to hear your Germacraft copypasta interpretation.
[12304.24s -> 12305.92s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[12305.92s -> 12310.56s]  Welcome to episode one of Germacraft series where I play Minecraft.
[12311.36s -> 12314.03s]  He forgot his line.
[12314.03s -> 12316.19s]  He forgot his line.
[12316.19s -> 12322.27s]  So when I say let's play, I touch on very loosely because I'm an idiot at this game.
[12322.27s -> 12326.03s]  It's going to be a lot of triumphs, a lot of fails, or at least I'm hoping.
[12326.03s -> 12327.95s]  So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.
[12333.44s -> 12338.20s]  I pulled back.
[12338.20s -> 12340.28s]  I want to reiterate something he said.
[12340.28s -> 12341.00s]  Yeah.
[12341.00s -> 12343.24s]  It's going to be a lot of triumphs, a lot of fails.
[12343.88s -> 12346.76s]  I'm hoping he's hoping for a lot of fails.
[12348.28s -> 12349.32s]  Entertainment value.
[12349.32s -> 12350.44s]  That's entertainment value.
[12350.44s -> 12351.00s]  He's right.
[12351.00s -> 12352.44s]  I don't think that's.
[12352.44s -> 12352.84s]  All right.
[12353.80s -> 12354.68s]  What have we got?
[12354.68s -> 12357.16s]  I think he is tarnishing your legacy.
[12357.16s -> 12357.56s]  Why?
[12357.56s -> 12358.20s]  For what?
[12358.20s -> 12358.92s]  I would never.
[12358.92s -> 12361.48s]  By misspeaking, you mixed up a couple words.
[12361.48s -> 12362.36s]  You had to look.
[12362.36s -> 12362.92s]  But it's hard.
[12362.92s -> 12363.88s]  No one has had to look yet.
[12363.96s -> 12365.16s]  You had to look.
[12365.16s -> 12366.12s]  I got to call a challenge.
[12367.08s -> 12369.29s]  We probably can't get that back.
[12369.29s -> 12369.93s]  Yeah.
[12369.93s -> 12372.49s]  I'm just bringing a different new twist.
[12372.49s -> 12375.21s]  Everyone's looking for like what's the new about the new drama.
[12375.21s -> 12376.89s]  It's the new drama.
[12376.89s -> 12377.77s]  I like him.
[12377.77s -> 12379.29s]  I think he's got what it takes.
[12379.29s -> 12381.85s]  We're kind of bringing a new zass to it, making everyone, you know,
[12381.85s -> 12382.89s]  we're excited for something new.
[12384.09s -> 12385.21s]  Honestly, let me be honest with you.
[12385.21s -> 12387.77s]  Play the crying music if you can.
[12389.21s -> 12390.81s]  I think that's not crying music.
[12390.81s -> 12392.01s]  They can only cry to the song.
[12392.01s -> 12393.13s]  Crying music, crying music, please.
[12393.85s -> 12396.89s]  I think that honestly, you came up with the piano.
[12397.53s -> 12398.73s]  He had the rats.
[12398.73s -> 12400.49s]  Number one piano guy.
[12400.49s -> 12404.43s]  He had the rat song.
[12404.43s -> 12405.55s]  He knew the rat song.
[12405.55s -> 12407.79s]  Who knew the rat song out of anybody here?
[12409.31s -> 12412.59s]  He's the only one that knew the rat song.
[12412.59s -> 12413.71s]  And he did it by heart.
[12415.23s -> 12416.75s]  It's hard to cry.
[12416.75s -> 12420.11s]  I must admit I felt something for the rats.
[12420.11s -> 12420.99s]  I did.
[12420.99s -> 12422.91s]  That's why you were always a yes from me.
[12422.91s -> 12423.39s]  Me too.
[12423.39s -> 12425.53s]  Thank you, German.
[12425.53s -> 12427.05s]  I think you've convinced me.
[12427.05s -> 12429.61s]  His past failures make up for his current failures.
[12429.61s -> 12431.13s]  How do we get you two on board?
[12436.03s -> 12437.23s]  Do you want to do the rat song again?
[12438.44s -> 12439.88s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12440.52s -> 12442.17s]  What color is your hair?
[12443.34s -> 12443.82s]  Your color.
[12444.38s -> 12445.50s]  Your hair looks kind of black.
[12447.10s -> 12447.98s]  I'm pretty sure it's your color.
[12447.98s -> 12448.78s]  It's just the lighting.
[12448.78s -> 12450.38s]  I didn't pick that up the first few minutes.
[12451.18s -> 12455.52s]  You didn't pick that up that he is obviously brown.
[12455.52s -> 12456.24s]  It's kind of black.
[12456.24s -> 12456.96s]  It's kind of black.
[12456.96s -> 12457.52s]  Come on, German.
[12457.52s -> 12458.48s]  You're on my side.
[12458.48s -> 12458.80s]  You got me.
[12458.80s -> 12460.32s]  Oh, your hair is black.
[12460.32s -> 12460.96s]  Your hair is black.
[12460.96s -> 12461.68s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[12462.32s -> 12463.52s]  German, come on.
[12463.52s -> 12464.16s]  Some hair dye.
[12464.16s -> 12464.64s]  You heard him.
[12464.64s -> 12466.16s]  Get the fuck out of here, man.
[12466.16s -> 12467.20s]  Don't do it like that.
[12467.20s -> 12467.68s]  Sorry.
[12467.68s -> 12468.16s]  I'm sorry.
[12468.16s -> 12468.96s]  I got upset.
[12468.96s -> 12469.36s]  Your hair is black.
[12469.36s -> 12469.68s]  All right.
[12469.68s -> 12470.96s]  Behave yourself.
[12470.96s -> 12472.00s]  It was that four nos.
[12472.80s -> 12476.80s]  I'll take mine back just to be able to say to chat that I backtracked and I didn't give
[12476.80s -> 12480.88s]  you a no because I want to make sure people know that I'm on both sides and I never am
[12480.88s -> 12484.24s]  part of any argument that I always am on both sides of every argument.
[12484.24s -> 12486.00s]  So everyone agrees with me every time.
[12486.64s -> 12488.56s]  You know, so thank you for coming.
[12489.36s -> 12489.92s]  Appreciate it.
[12491.18s -> 12493.18s]  Always always correct on every argument.
[12493.18s -> 12496.46s]  You know, no, but I never on one side or the other when I'm on everybody's side.
[12496.46s -> 12498.06s]  You know, I love the song though.
[12498.06s -> 12499.10s]  It was a great song.
[12499.10s -> 12500.22s]  See you on Broadway.
[12500.22s -> 12502.30s]  Only person that knew the rat song.
[12502.30s -> 12503.34s]  Thank you so much.
[12503.34s -> 12503.98s]  Fuck you.
[12503.98s -> 12505.50s]  Fuck you for not knowing that.
[12506.70s -> 12507.82s]  I just didn't know he had black hair.
[12507.82s -> 12508.54s]  I thought it was one.
[12508.54s -> 12509.98s]  Yeah, that's the shame.
[12509.98s -> 12510.78s]  Hate those.
[12510.78s -> 12513.18s]  Can we bring out number nine, please?
[12516.46s -> 12517.02s]  Thanks for having me.
[12518.22s -> 12518.94s]  Welcome.
[12518.94s -> 12519.66s]  Welcome back.
[12519.66s -> 12520.14s]  Thank you.
[12520.14s -> 12520.94s]  How are you feeling?
[12521.50s -> 12521.90s]  Great.
[12521.90s -> 12523.10s]  Still shaking a little bit.
[12523.10s -> 12526.22s]  It might have been the three cups of coffee I've had today, but hey, yeah, we're here.
[12526.22s -> 12527.34s]  We're here and we're partying.
[12527.34s -> 12528.86s]  But not the crack that we all smoke before.
[12530.38s -> 12530.78s]  Never mind.
[12530.78s -> 12532.44s]  Just go ahead.
[12532.44s -> 12532.76s]  Go ahead.
[12534.04s -> 12538.20s]  If you want to do number nine, if you want to do German craft coffee pasta, I hope you're prepared.
[12538.20s -> 12538.68s]  I am.
[12538.68s -> 12539.32s]  I'm prepared.
[12540.84s -> 12541.32s]  Right there.
[12541.96s -> 12542.84s]  There's a camera here.
[12543.80s -> 12544.44s]  Cameras all over you.
[12544.44s -> 12544.84s]  Number nine.
[12547.00s -> 12548.20s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[12548.20s -> 12551.32s]  Welcome to episode one of German craft.
[12551.32s -> 12553.40s]  The series where I play Minecraft.
[12553.40s -> 12554.92s]  This is going to be a single player.
[12554.92s -> 12555.88s]  Let's play.
[12555.88s -> 12561.40s]  And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[12561.40s -> 12562.68s]  You're going to see lots of fails.
[12562.68s -> 12564.92s]  You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[12564.92s -> 12565.88s]  At least I'm hoping.
[12565.88s -> 12568.36s]  So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.
[12568.36s -> 12569.64s]  A cup of cocoa.
[12569.64s -> 12570.76s]  I got an upside right here.
[12570.76s -> 12571.48s]  Freshly brewed.
[12571.48s -> 12572.20s]  Let me take a sip.
[12572.20s -> 12575.07s]  That's some good cider.
[12578.00s -> 12578.96s]  That was amazing.
[12578.96s -> 12579.52s]  Amazing.
[12579.52s -> 12581.04s]  That was amazing.
[12581.04s -> 12581.60s]  Amazing.
[12581.60s -> 12582.16s]  Number nine.
[12583.12s -> 12584.32s]  I have one question.
[12586.30s -> 12587.82s]  Do you brew cider?
[12587.82s -> 12590.08s]  Is that like a thing?
[12590.08s -> 12590.80s]  You can, yeah.
[12590.80s -> 12592.16s]  I mean, like people brew tea.
[12593.04s -> 12594.00s]  Why would he know this?
[12594.80s -> 12596.64s]  Because he's going to be the next German.
[12596.64s -> 12601.04s]  You know, the answer to that question, I would brew my own cider.
[12601.04s -> 12602.16s]  And I would just figure it out.
[12602.80s -> 12604.48s]  You just got a pie in the face.
[12604.48s -> 12605.52s]  Clown got you.
[12605.52s -> 12606.40s]  Clown got you.
[12606.40s -> 12607.60s]  You get your hands off me.
[12608.32s -> 12609.60s]  You've been touching me all day.
[12609.60s -> 12610.56s]  I can't put my hands on you.
[12613.76s -> 12614.24s]  That was sharp.
[12614.24s -> 12614.72s]  He backed you up.
[12614.72s -> 12615.20s]  Do you hear that?
[12615.20s -> 12615.92s]  What did he say?
[12615.92s -> 12617.36s]  Is that a clown or what?
[12617.36s -> 12618.32s]  He backed you up real quick.
[12618.32s -> 12620.00s]  Oh, excuse me.
[12620.96s -> 12621.52s]  Number nine.
[12622.08s -> 12622.88s]  You got no access.
[12623.84s -> 12625.28s]  Yeah, we had some safety concerns.
[12626.00s -> 12626.32s]  I take time back.
[12626.32s -> 12627.84s]  Don't you appreciate that?
[12627.84s -> 12628.64s]  He's a dick, don't you?
[12628.64s -> 12632.08s]  I'm concerned about another like, like you're a suck-up German.
[12632.16s -> 12635.28s]  That you're just going to take over where he left off and not improve at all.
[12635.28s -> 12637.20s]  Okay, I understand that.
[12637.20s -> 12638.00s]  Thank you for that.
[12638.00s -> 12639.12s]  Like, you're really like...
[12639.12s -> 12640.00s]  Thank you for that.
[12640.96s -> 12641.28s]  Yeah.
[12642.00s -> 12642.72s]  Doctor?
[12642.72s -> 12643.28s]  Uh, sir.
[12644.24s -> 12647.36s]  Could you just turn around in a circle for a minute, please?
[12650.89s -> 12651.37s]  Thank you.
[12652.01s -> 12653.37s]  There was no reason for that.
[12653.37s -> 12654.09s]  Oh, okay, great.
[12654.09s -> 12655.85s]  Oh, he just wanted to...
[12655.85s -> 12658.01s]  But, uh, happy to see you.
[12658.01s -> 12659.61s]  Did you like what you saw?
[12659.61s -> 12662.09s]  The real German has a dinosaur dumping.
[12662.89s -> 12663.63s]  Sorry.
[12664.67s -> 12666.43s]  Honestly, you're an inspiring performer.
[12667.23s -> 12669.07s]  And I'm excited to see you in the final round.
[12669.07s -> 12669.39s]  Thank you so much.
[12669.39s -> 12670.03s]  Number nine.
[12670.03s -> 12670.75s]  Congratulations.
[12670.75s -> 12671.39s]  Thank you guys.
[12671.39s -> 12671.87s]  Thank you.
[12671.87s -> 12672.43s]  Thank you.
[12672.43s -> 12673.07s]  Good luck, sir.
[12673.63s -> 12674.59s]  You're in Chad's hands.
[12675.23s -> 12676.11s]  I think we're up there.
[12677.31s -> 12677.95s]  Number 10.
[12678.99s -> 12679.55s]  Come on out.
[12682.41s -> 12683.13s]  Oh, what was that?
[12683.13s -> 12683.61s]  Sorry.
[12683.61s -> 12684.09s]  Hot.
[12684.09s -> 12684.57s]  Mic is hot.
[12685.21s -> 12687.28s]  How's it going?
[12687.28s -> 12687.60s]  It's good.
[12687.60s -> 12688.24s]  How are you guys doing?
[12688.24s -> 12688.56s]  Finals.
[12688.56s -> 12689.84s]  Who would have thought?
[12689.84s -> 12690.40s]  Number 10.
[12691.20s -> 12693.20s]  You're the, you're the, you're the lying in your back fart guy.
[12693.20s -> 12693.52s]  That's right.
[12693.52s -> 12694.40s]  I am the back part man.
[12695.20s -> 12695.84s]  Yeah.
[12695.84s -> 12697.20s]  I think that's on Brandon.
[12697.20s -> 12698.16s]  Sorry for keeping you here.
[12698.72s -> 12700.40s]  Oh, uh, what?
[12700.40s -> 12701.04s]  It's okay.
[12701.04s -> 12702.96s]  A lot of people got to go home by now, so...
[12702.96s -> 12704.40s]  Well, you know, I'm chilling.
[12704.40s -> 12704.96s]  I'm doing great.
[12705.76s -> 12707.44s]  Well, you know, back farting was one thing.
[12707.44s -> 12709.52s]  I'm excited to see you do this copy pasta.
[12709.52s -> 12710.08s]  If you want to...
[12710.72s -> 12710.96s]  Yep.
[12710.96s -> 12711.36s]  Let's do it.
[12713.08s -> 12713.64s]  You get the floor.
[12715.04s -> 12716.80s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[12716.80s -> 12721.12s]  Welcome to episode one of Germacraft.
[12721.12s -> 12723.12s]  The series where I played Minecraft.
[12723.12s -> 12724.96s]  This is going to be a single player.
[12724.96s -> 12725.92s]  Let's play.
[12725.92s -> 12731.92s]  And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[12731.92s -> 12735.85s]  You're going to see lots of fails, lots of triumphs.
[12735.85s -> 12736.89s]  At least I'm hoping.
[12736.89s -> 12740.78s]  So grab yourself a hot cup of cocoa, hot cup of coffee.
[12741.34s -> 12743.18s]  I have apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[12743.18s -> 12744.38s]  Let me take a sip.
[12744.38s -> 12748.22s]  Ah, it's good cider.
[12748.22s -> 12749.10s]  He made sound effect.
[12749.10s -> 12749.50s]  I don't know.
[12749.50s -> 12750.30s]  He made a sound effect.
[12750.30s -> 12751.50s]  Sound effect.
[12751.50s -> 12752.38s]  I like the tea.
[12752.38s -> 12753.42s]  Very effective sound effect.
[12753.42s -> 12753.82s]  More like a...
[12753.82s -> 12754.62s]  It's even better.
[12754.62s -> 12756.14s]  We're going to know.
[12756.14s -> 12756.94s]  Okay, please mom.
[12757.02s -> 12762.14s]  Well, you know, to me, it was just more of like an NPR read, you know?
[12762.14s -> 12766.62s]  Like I'm listening to radio and they're about to introduce the next song more than a let's play.
[12767.34s -> 12768.46s]  Let's play, you know?
[12771.18s -> 12776.54s]  It's tough because you got the back farting, you got the look, you got the energy.
[12778.03s -> 12781.31s]  I just, I don't know if you got what it takes to be able to order
[12781.31s -> 12783.47s]  four sandwiches from McDonald's, eat it and shit your pants.
[12785.07s -> 12785.31s]  Really?
[12785.31s -> 12786.11s]  What makes you say that?
[12786.51s -> 12787.47s]  I just something about it.
[12787.47s -> 12788.19s]  I'm so sorry.
[12790.19s -> 12791.39s]  You missed Machito yesterday.
[12791.39s -> 12792.35s]  He was pretty fucking vicious.
[12792.35s -> 12794.11s]  What is your McDonald's order, if I could ask?
[12794.11s -> 12795.31s]  What's your McDonald's order?
[12795.31s -> 12795.55s]  Yeah.
[12796.51s -> 12799.23s]  That's four Big Macs and two Flurries.
[12799.95s -> 12800.51s]  That's it.
[12800.51s -> 12801.23s]  That's all I need.
[12801.23s -> 12801.95s]  That's not bad.
[12801.95s -> 12802.51s]  That's absurd.
[12802.51s -> 12803.23s]  That's not bad.
[12803.23s -> 12805.71s]  No, I think the fries are actually pretty overrated there.
[12805.71s -> 12806.27s]  No lie.
[12806.27s -> 12806.83s]  Yeah.
[12806.83s -> 12808.91s]  I have a question for Jerma.
[12808.91s -> 12809.31s]  Sure.
[12809.31s -> 12812.03s]  I think this needs to be cleared up and should have been cleared up earlier.
[12812.03s -> 12815.47s]  How many takes did you do on the original Minecraft episode one
[12815.47s -> 12817.71s]  before you were like, that's the one?
[12817.71s -> 12818.72s]  How many takes?
[12818.72s -> 12821.84s]  I can tell, like the way it's written, I can tell like you were,
[12821.84s -> 12822.88s]  it was bubbling, you know?
[12822.88s -> 12824.32s]  Like you didn't do it first take.
[12824.32s -> 12825.84s]  I mean, it was probably 10 takes.
[12826.96s -> 12830.16s]  Look, let me be real to the entire audience watching.
[12830.88s -> 12833.36s]  Every YouTuber that you've ever heard in your whole life,
[12834.32s -> 12841.36s]  they spend two fucking hours doing their intro and they hate it.
[12841.36s -> 12844.00s]  They hate every single take they do.
[12844.00s -> 12845.76s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one.
[12846.00s -> 12847.52s]  Of JermaCraft.
[12847.52s -> 12849.36s]  They fucking retake it 10 times.
[12851.12s -> 12851.84s]  What?
[12851.84s -> 12853.68s]  And you hated his first take.
[12854.56s -> 12855.52s]  Let's get a second take.
[12855.52s -> 12856.00s]  Second take.
[12857.10s -> 12857.90s]  Two take, Tyler.
[12858.70s -> 12859.58s]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[12859.58s -> 12859.90s]  Thank you.
[12861.50s -> 12867.02s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[12867.02s -> 12868.54s]  It's the same.
[12868.54s -> 12869.10s]  No, it's not.
[12869.10s -> 12869.58s]  Let him go.
[12869.58s -> 12870.38s]  Let him go.
[12870.38s -> 12871.82s]  Let's get one more from the top, please.
[12871.82s -> 12872.70s]  From the top.
[12872.70s -> 12873.98s]  And really think about it.
[12873.98s -> 12874.70s]  I pull it back.
[12874.70s -> 12875.90s]  And you're underwater.
[12876.86s -> 12877.90s]  It's a let's play.
[12877.90s -> 12878.70s]  You're having fun.
[12878.70s -> 12879.34s]  You're having fun.
[12879.34s -> 12880.14s]  Number 10, you're underwater.
[12880.14s -> 12880.78s]  You're underwater.
[12880.78s -> 12882.86s]  You're underwater and there's submarines everywhere.
[12884.30s -> 12887.82s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[12887.82s -> 12889.10s]  How are you talking underwater?
[12889.10s -> 12889.82s]  How are you talking?
[12889.82s -> 12890.94s]  Shit, I didn't think that.
[12890.94s -> 12891.90s]  This is unrealistic.
[12891.90s -> 12894.46s]  I thought it was like Subnautica or something.
[12894.46s -> 12895.50s]  No, it's Minecraft.
[12896.22s -> 12897.10s]  You'd be drowning.
[12897.66s -> 12898.62s]  You wouldn't talk if you're...
[12898.62s -> 12902.14s]  You're giving him like unrealistic ways to like go about this.
[12902.14s -> 12903.28s]  This is like the fourth take.
[12903.28s -> 12904.16s]  This doesn't make sense.
[12904.16s -> 12906.16s]  If he's underwater, why would he talk so clearly?
[12906.16s -> 12907.92s]  Honestly, I think you have what it takes.
[12907.92s -> 12910.24s]  Unfortunately, these two knuckleheads...
[12910.24s -> 12911.20s]  Well, it's two-two, isn't it?
[12913.20s -> 12913.76s]  Yeah, these two.
[12914.56s -> 12915.68s]  Wait, what are you doing?
[12915.68s -> 12916.24s]  What are you...
[12916.24s -> 12917.04s]  Is that a no?
[12917.68s -> 12918.16s]  It's a no.
[12919.36s -> 12921.20s]  Number 10, I think you really have what it took.
[12921.20s -> 12921.84s]  Oh, thank you very much.
[12926.40s -> 12927.36s]  I thought you did too.
[12927.36s -> 12928.40s]  Give me notes for me, doctor.
[12928.40s -> 12928.72s]  Yeah.
[12928.72s -> 12929.92s]  Doctor, any notes?
[12929.92s -> 12933.28s]  Sir, I heard you wax poetic.
[12934.16s -> 12936.78s]  I heard you talk from the heart.
[12937.42s -> 12940.54s]  I heard intelligence of a new degree.
[12940.54s -> 12941.18s]  So no way.
[12941.18s -> 12943.66s]  Get your fucking hands off me.
[12943.66s -> 12944.30s]  That's fair.
[12944.30s -> 12945.02s]  Thank you.
[12945.02s -> 12946.06s]  I appreciate that, doctor.
[12946.06s -> 12950.16s]  Wait, number 10, you haven't cried yet.
[12951.74s -> 12958.54s]  You know, I came out here just a couple years ago to make a career at Twitch because I just love,
[12958.54s -> 12961.34s]  you know, I mean, you're such a young audience and they're really...
[12962.14s -> 12964.70s]  They'll give you tons of attention, you know, stroke the ego.
[12964.70s -> 12966.54s]  And I'm just looking for that.
[12967.02s -> 12967.82s]  That's how you win it now.
[12967.82s -> 12968.78s]  But you still are crying.
[12970.46s -> 12970.94s]  Cry though.
[12971.66s -> 12972.62s]  Yeah, I know.
[12972.62s -> 12973.66s]  It's fucking sad.
[12974.38s -> 12975.34s]  I feel your pain.
[12976.86s -> 12980.86s]  Cry and make sure you like put it on like the screen that he's crying so we get extra ratings
[12980.86s -> 12983.02s]  and stuff because people like when people cry on these shows.
[12983.66s -> 12984.38s]  Oh, God.
[12985.26s -> 12993.58s]  Hey, buddy, you have what it takes to be a shining star somewhere in your life.
[12993.58s -> 12995.26s]  Dr. Smoikson, please diagnose him.
[12995.26s -> 12996.46s]  Don't give up, sir.
[12996.46s -> 12998.62s]  WGBH is looking...
[13000.70s -> 13001.74s]  That's not even...
[13001.74s -> 13002.70s]  We're here.
[13002.70s -> 13003.58s]  That's Boston.
[13005.34s -> 13005.82s]  Thank you.
[13005.82s -> 13007.42s]  What are you trying?
[13007.42s -> 13008.06s]  Get out of here.
[13008.70s -> 13010.06s]  All right, I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[13010.06s -> 13011.10s]  Have a great night, Joe.
[13011.10s -> 13012.62s]  PBS is your...
[13012.62s -> 13013.42s]  PBS.
[13013.42s -> 13015.66s]  Can we please send out number 13 if you're still around?
[13015.66s -> 13016.70s]  Reset these buzzers.
[13016.70s -> 13017.98s]  Reset the buzzers if we could.
[13020.25s -> 13020.75s]  Hey.
[13022.01s -> 13022.97s]  So groovy, huh?
[13022.97s -> 13024.09s]  This is getting me in the mood.
[13024.89s -> 13025.93s]  Okay, 13.
[13025.93s -> 13027.13s]  I always thought you had a great smile.
[13029.12s -> 13029.68s]  Hi, 13.
[13029.68s -> 13030.48s]  How are you doing?
[13030.48s -> 13031.20s]  Well, how are you doing?
[13032.08s -> 13032.72s]  13.
[13032.72s -> 13034.40s]  You made it all the way to the end.
[13035.12s -> 13036.08s]  How do you feel?
[13036.08s -> 13037.04s]  Surprised.
[13037.04s -> 13037.76s]  Surprised?
[13037.76s -> 13039.04s]  But with the nunchucks and the nuts?
[13039.04s -> 13039.84s]  That was a great joke.
[13039.84s -> 13042.96s]  I didn't think it was gonna, you know, make the cut.
[13043.52s -> 13044.32s]  Don't think so.
[13044.32s -> 13046.16s]  No, no, but I'm pleasantly surprised.
[13046.16s -> 13049.36s]  It was a good pre-planned joke and I liked it a lot.
[13049.36s -> 13050.88s]  And sometimes you got to think fast on your feet.
[13050.88s -> 13052.16s]  Do the pog face.
[13052.16s -> 13052.66s]  Pog.
[13053.36s -> 13054.00s]  What's a pog?
[13054.64s -> 13056.96s]  No, no, no, he got it.
[13056.96s -> 13057.76s]  He's got it.
[13057.76s -> 13059.60s]  Don't even, are you serious?
[13059.60s -> 13060.08s]  Is that it?
[13060.08s -> 13061.04s]  That's a pog face.
[13061.04s -> 13062.40s]  He did it first try.
[13062.40s -> 13063.52s]  He's like, no, he's doing this.
[13065.20s -> 13066.32s]  That's literally it right there.
[13066.32s -> 13067.04s]  That's it.
[13067.04s -> 13067.52s]  That's it.
[13067.52s -> 13068.08s]  That's it.
[13068.08s -> 13068.80s]  Hold that.
[13068.80s -> 13069.30s]  Hold that.
[13070.08s -> 13071.60s]  You cannot buzz him.
[13071.60s -> 13072.96s]  He took him five seconds.
[13072.96s -> 13073.68s]  That was good.
[13073.68s -> 13074.16s]  That was good.
[13074.16s -> 13075.28s]  He took him five seconds to do it.
[13076.46s -> 13077.42s]  All right, number 13.
[13077.42s -> 13080.06s]  If you could do the Germacraft copy pasta.
[13080.06s -> 13080.78s]  I would love to hear.
[13086.75s -> 13087.25s]  Hello.
[13087.87s -> 13094.59s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first episode of Germacraft, the series.
[13095.31s -> 13096.91s]  I play Minecraft.
[13097.79s -> 13101.07s]  Now, this is going to be a single player.
[13101.07s -> 13101.63s]  Let's play.
[13102.43s -> 13108.91s]  But when I use that term, let's play, I use that term loosely because I am an idiot in this game.
[13109.87s -> 13116.75s]  Now, you're going to see lots of triumphs, lots of fails, even more triumphs.
[13117.15s -> 13118.67s]  At least I'm hoping so.
[13118.67s -> 13122.43s]  So let's grab a nice hot cup of coffee.
[13122.43s -> 13124.03s]  Nice hot cup of cocoa.
[13124.03s -> 13126.91s]  I got a nice hot cup of cider right here.
[13129.69s -> 13131.69s]  It's invisible, but freshly brewed.
[13133.58s -> 13134.86s]  Oh, that's good cider.
[13138.65s -> 13142.17s]  I think coming in with a Christopher Walken is actually pretty brave.
[13142.17s -> 13143.77s]  He dropped it halfway through.
[13143.77s -> 13148.25s]  I mean, seriously, if you come in with a Walken, it's going to be good.
[13148.81s -> 13149.93s]  And that was a good Walken.
[13150.17s -> 13151.21s]  It sure was great.
[13151.21s -> 13152.33s]  Thank you, Germa.
[13154.09s -> 13160.33s]  If you do Germacraft copypasta with a Walken, wow, that's at least five or six extra points.
[13160.33s -> 13161.69s]  We're off to a good start.
[13161.69s -> 13162.57s]  Yes, we are.
[13162.57s -> 13166.81s]  Can you do like the cowbell routine, just to be sure?
[13166.81s -> 13169.05s]  I'm ready to know you.
[13169.05s -> 13170.25s]  Don't press the button.
[13170.25s -> 13171.29s]  I got a fever.
[13171.85s -> 13175.37s]  A new prescription is more Germa.
[13175.37s -> 13175.93s]  Okay, don't.
[13175.93s -> 13176.57s]  Got to have it.
[13178.09s -> 13178.97s]  He's got a Christopher Walken.
[13178.97s -> 13181.13s]  My pants on one leg at a time.
[13181.13s -> 13181.93s]  Nobody buzz this guy.
[13181.93s -> 13186.33s]  The only difference is after I've got my pants on, I replace Germa.
[13186.97s -> 13190.09s]  Okay, he's got an absolutely phenomenal Walken.
[13190.09s -> 13190.97s]  He's got a Walken.
[13190.97s -> 13192.09s]  That's better than my Trump.
[13192.09s -> 13193.37s]  That's better than my Bernie.
[13193.37s -> 13194.49s]  That's better than my Walken.
[13194.49s -> 13195.93s]  Is that J.R.R. Walken?
[13195.93s -> 13197.77s]  Oh, that's phenomenal.
[13197.77s -> 13199.13s]  Number 13, I don't.
[13200.32s -> 13200.82s]  Really?
[13201.44s -> 13202.64s]  He can't please everybody.
[13203.36s -> 13204.24s]  Can't please everyone.
[13206.70s -> 13207.82s]  He said himself.
[13209.08s -> 13210.04s]  Don't, no.
[13210.04s -> 13211.48s]  I'm kidding, I'm talking about.
[13212.52s -> 13213.32s]  I'm good, I'm happy.
[13213.32s -> 13214.44s]  I took it back, I took it back.
[13214.44s -> 13215.16s]  It was the moment.
[13215.16s -> 13217.72s]  Number 13, you've made it to the final three.
[13219.24s -> 13220.60s]  That is the final three we have.
[13220.60s -> 13221.72s]  That's a great celebration.
[13222.28s -> 13223.80s]  That's a good, I'm sorry, I take it back.
[13223.80s -> 13225.24s]  That's such a good celebration.
[13225.80s -> 13226.60s]  Jog in place.
[13226.60s -> 13227.24s]  Thank you very much.
[13227.24s -> 13228.52s]  We do have our final three, don't we?
[13229.24s -> 13231.00s]  I think we have our actual final three.
[13231.88s -> 13232.68s]  I love to hear that.
[13233.48s -> 13235.88s]  So we're going to take one final break.
[13236.86s -> 13237.74s]  And then guess what?
[13238.99s -> 13243.95s]  You decide on who replaces me on German 985.
[13243.95s -> 13246.03s]  Twitch.tv slash German 985.
[13246.59s -> 13248.19s]  We'll be right back in about two, three minutes.
[13249.69s -> 13250.73s]  For the real end.
[13734.97s -> 13735.69s]  Okay, we're back.
[13736.80s -> 13739.52s]  If you could please bring the three finalists out on stage,
[13739.52s -> 13740.24s]  please, if we could.
[13741.40s -> 13745.88s]  That would be one and nine and 13.
[13746.60s -> 13748.92s]  Hello, one, nine, and 13.
[13748.92s -> 13749.42s]  How are you?
[13751.36s -> 13754.56s]  You are the finalists for who will replace me,
[13754.56s -> 13756.32s]  German 985, on my Twitch channel.
[13757.04s -> 13758.08s]  How do you feel?
[13758.08s -> 13760.32s]  Very well, still shaking.
[13760.32s -> 13761.92s]  Good, good, shaking, shaking.
[13762.64s -> 13765.04s]  Well, unfortunately, the judges here now
[13765.04s -> 13768.16s]  no longer have a say because it's now your say.
[13769.82s -> 13771.26s]  They don't have a mic, but that's okay.
[13772.45s -> 13773.81s]  Everybody in the chat right now,
[13773.81s -> 13778.13s]  there will be a poll to decide of these three.
[13779.18s -> 13781.74s]  One, nine, and 13.
[13782.77s -> 13785.33s]  Who takes the German 985 moniker?
[13785.97s -> 13787.78s]  There will be a poll in chat.
[13787.78s -> 13789.38s]  It's for you to decide.
[13790.26s -> 13791.70s]  You get the final decision.
[13792.58s -> 13794.82s]  One, nine, or 13.
[13795.54s -> 13796.66s]  We look forward to the poll.
[13796.66s -> 13799.22s]  Maybe, maybe, maybe give some pizzazz at the end, you know?
[13799.22s -> 13801.38s]  Give a little, show them why you deserve it.
[13802.35s -> 13803.15s]  One, go ahead.
[13803.15s -> 13804.03s]  One, what do you got?
[13805.58s -> 13806.38s]  Right.
[13806.38s -> 13807.18s]  Nine, what do you got?
[13809.22s -> 13810.34s]  13, what are you doing?
[13810.98s -> 13811.94s]  Is it Batman?
[13813.06s -> 13813.94s]  Was that JoJo?
[13814.82s -> 13817.38s]  Oh, JoJo, I love JoJo.
[13821.14s -> 13823.22s]  We've got a very, this is ridiculous.
[13823.22s -> 13824.74s]  Okay, come on, what's the poll at right now?
[13824.74s -> 13826.34s]  It's between one percentage point, Jerm.
[13826.34s -> 13826.98s]  I'm looking at the stats right now.
[13826.98s -> 13828.18s]  It's one percentage point.
[13828.74s -> 13829.46s]  It's narrow.
[13830.64s -> 13832.16s]  One vote can take this.
[13832.16s -> 13834.48s]  One vote is deciding who wins.
[13834.48s -> 13835.92s]  Number nine, can you step forward one?
[13836.90s -> 13838.02s]  Move back now, thank you.
[13838.58s -> 13839.86s]  Number one, step forward two.
[13840.66s -> 13841.46s]  Step left three.
[13842.58s -> 13843.86s]  Step right three.
[13843.86s -> 13844.82s]  Cha cha, daddy-o.
[13844.82s -> 13845.62s]  Real smooth.
[13845.62s -> 13847.94s]  Step back and step back, okay?
[13849.06s -> 13850.26s]  What are we at right now for the poll?
[13850.26s -> 13850.74s]  Let's say it.
[13853.01s -> 13855.09s]  This is your Jerma985.
[13855.89s -> 13857.65s]  You are deciding right now.
[13862.22s -> 13864.38s]  One, nine, or 13.
[13864.38s -> 13866.62s]  Future one of the biggest channels on all of Twitch.
[13867.18s -> 13868.62s]  My goodness gracious.
[13868.62s -> 13869.66s]  I think it's going to double.
[13870.46s -> 13873.49s]  The projections are massive.
[13873.49s -> 13874.85s]  I don't know what to even do.
[13874.85s -> 13877.41s]  No matter what, all three of these guys
[13877.41s -> 13879.81s]  are a better pick for Jerma985 than Jerma985.
[13879.81s -> 13882.13s]  Absolutely, and I don't want you guys to forget us
[13882.77s -> 13884.21s]  when you ascend to godhood.
[13884.21s -> 13885.57s]  I would love to collab still
[13885.57s -> 13887.01s]  because I think I'll be even bigger.
[13887.73s -> 13890.64s]  You say totes collab?
[13890.64s -> 13891.12s]  That's great.
[13891.68s -> 13893.68s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the winner.
[13893.68s -> 13894.64s]  This is charming, totes.
[13896.77s -> 13900.10s]  The winner of the Who Will Replace Me
[13900.82s -> 13906.91s]  Jerma985 show is number one.
[13906.91s -> 13907.95s]  Step forward.
[13907.95s -> 13910.37s]  Now step back.
[13912.27s -> 13913.31s]  Number nine, step forward.
[13915.44s -> 13918.32s]  It's number 13.
[13918.40s -> 13919.92s]  Number 13 is the winner
[13919.92s -> 13922.40s]  for the Who Will Replace Me Jerma985.
[13924.06s -> 13924.62s]  Well earned.
[13924.62s -> 13928.86s]  Number 13 with 55% of the vote.
[13928.86s -> 13930.54s]  Unbelievable.
[13930.54s -> 13931.42s]  It was majority.
[13932.06s -> 13934.06s]  It was a majority.
[13934.06s -> 13936.38s]  New Jerma, new Jerma.
[13936.38s -> 13937.34s]  This is incredible.
[13937.34s -> 13937.98s]  Excellent.
[13937.98s -> 13939.18s]  A whole new era.
[13939.18s -> 13940.22s]  A whole new era.
[13940.22s -> 13941.10s]  I love this guy.
[13942.62s -> 13943.42s]  Wait a second.
[13943.42s -> 13943.98s]  Wait, what?
[13945.02s -> 13945.52s]  Wait a minute.
[13946.64s -> 13946.96s]  What?
[13946.96s -> 13947.68s]  Kill the music.
[13949.09s -> 13949.73s]  Number 13.
[13950.85s -> 13952.53s]  You think you have what it takes to be me?
[13954.58s -> 13955.22s]  You think you do?
[13956.66s -> 13958.02s]  Well, that's interesting
[13958.02s -> 13960.18s]  because if you think that you have what it takes to be me
[13960.82s -> 13962.66s]  then you need to have what it takes to beat me
[13963.55s -> 13965.07s]  because you're going against the master now.
[13966.77s -> 13969.41s]  You got to go against 1v1 me.
[13970.77s -> 13972.69s]  Everybody understands this.
[13972.69s -> 13975.57s]  I'm not going to let this channel go very, very loosely.
[13975.57s -> 13977.33s]  We had like a process.
[13977.33s -> 13978.53s]  Oh, there's a process.
[13978.53s -> 13980.77s]  The process is I got to see if you have what it really takes.
[13982.99s -> 13983.79s]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[13984.43s -> 13985.95s]  if you think you've got what it takes,
[13986.51s -> 13987.71s]  we will find out right now.
[13990.37s -> 13991.65s]  You think you can beat me?
[13993.09s -> 13994.74s]  You think you can beat me?
[13994.74s -> 13995.54s]  I know I can beat you.
[13995.54s -> 13996.90s]  I don't know what I'm going to beat you at.
[13996.90s -> 13997.94s]  You know you can beat me.
[13997.94s -> 13998.90s]  Go ahead and cue the music.
[13999.62s -> 14000.50s]  Good luck.
[14001.14s -> 14002.34s]  Weird monopoly, man.
[14003.22s -> 14006.02s]  Like a Swedish monopoly, man.
[14012.03s -> 14012.91s]  What is planned?
[14012.91s -> 14013.95s]  You guys secretized this?
[14014.99s -> 14018.96s]  Are you doing it so well?
[14019.28s -> 14020.96s]  Nobody beats me at my own game.
[14020.96s -> 14021.84s]  This is incredible.
[14024.26s -> 14025.46s]  These moves.
[14025.46s -> 14026.90s]  Whoa, whoa.
[14026.90s -> 14027.70s]  New Jerma.
[14033.70s -> 14035.22s]  He had moves the whole time.
[14037.22s -> 14037.78s]  One handed.
[14044.18s -> 14044.90s]  Something's happening.
[14044.90s -> 14045.70s]  Can you do this though?
[14045.70s -> 14046.34s]  Number 13.
[14046.98s -> 14047.70s]  There's no window.
[14047.70s -> 14048.58s]  Sure, there's no window.
[14049.22s -> 14049.72s]  Oh.
[14052.61s -> 14053.41s]  Perfectly executed.
[14055.01s -> 14055.81s]  I don't think so.
[14059.57s -> 14061.20s]  What's the vote say?
[14064.29s -> 14065.33s]  Chatters, you decide.
[14066.05s -> 14067.49s]  New Jerma or old Jerma?
[14067.49s -> 14068.37s]  Which one you pick it?
[14072.67s -> 14073.79s]  The old Jerma?
[14073.79s -> 14074.29s]  Yeah.
[14079.42s -> 14080.22s]  All right.
[14080.22s -> 14080.72s]  I win.
[14082.19s -> 14083.55s]  Nobody replaces me.
[14083.55s -> 14084.05s]  Nobody.
[14084.93s -> 14086.21s]  I'll be here forever.
[14086.21s -> 14087.41s]  This hardly seems fair.
[14088.85s -> 14090.13s]  No, that's not how it works.
[14090.13s -> 14091.09s]  What do you mean it's not how it works?
[14091.09s -> 14092.13s]  No, just get the fuck out of here.
[14092.13s -> 14092.63s]  Fuck off.
[14092.63s -> 14093.33s]  Cheater.
[14093.33s -> 14093.83s]  Fuck off.
[14095.00s -> 14096.04s]  No, fuck off.
[14096.04s -> 14096.54s]  You lose.
[14098.31s -> 14099.11s]  Sweet, what was that?
[14099.11s -> 14099.59s]  Six hours.
[14099.59s -> 14100.15s]  Get the fuck out.
[14100.15s -> 14100.87s]  Just go fucking back.
[14100.87s -> 14103.03s]  Why are we all here if you were just going to walk on stage?
[14103.03s -> 14103.67s]  Just go.
[14103.67s -> 14104.17s]  Fuck off.
[14105.59s -> 14106.47s]  No, it's you.
[14106.47s -> 14108.15s]  You decided you come to the show
[14108.15s -> 14109.83s]  and you beat me for a little while and I win.
[14109.83s -> 14111.51s]  No, no, it's called being a sore loser.
[14112.07s -> 14112.63s]  No, it's not.
[14112.63s -> 14113.67s]  This needs to be fixed.
[14114.55s -> 14115.27s]  Judges, really?
[14115.27s -> 14115.77s]  Judges?
[14116.71s -> 14117.19s]  What can we do?
[14117.19s -> 14118.71s]  What power do we have, Woodward?
[14118.71s -> 14119.27s]  You don't have power.
[14119.27s -> 14119.91s]  Get the fuck off.
[14119.91s -> 14121.59s]  I spent weeks rehearsing for this.
[14121.59s -> 14122.31s]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[14122.31s -> 14122.55s]  I don't care.
[14122.55s -> 14123.03s]  Weeks?
[14123.03s -> 14124.63s]  It's my life, you whole thing.
[14124.63s -> 14125.19s]  Your life?
[14126.47s -> 14126.97s]  Listen.
[14127.75s -> 14128.85s]  What, do you want to fucking go?
[14128.85s -> 14129.81s]  Are you going to fight?
[14129.81s -> 14130.85s]  What, you think it's fucking funny?
[14130.85s -> 14131.89s]  Is he ready to throw?
[14131.89s -> 14133.97s]  He thinks, oh yeah, you can take me too.
[14133.97s -> 14135.09s]  Oh, you think you can take me, yeah.
[14135.09s -> 14135.49s]  Have fun.
[14135.49s -> 14136.61s]  Yeah, let's get this shit off.
[14136.61s -> 14137.57s]  Fuck off, idiot.
[14137.57s -> 14138.21s]  No, this is good.
[14138.21s -> 14139.09s]  This is good TV.
[14139.09s -> 14140.61s]  If it works for Jake Paul, it'll work for us.
[14141.17s -> 14145.49s]  Oh, I'm actually pissed up because this guy thinks he's fucking got what it takes.
[14145.49s -> 14146.77s]  Okay, you want to fucking go?
[14146.77s -> 14148.37s]  Okay, let's go, let's go.
[14148.37s -> 14149.49s]  Shit, give me that fucking number.
[14150.45s -> 14151.01s]  What is this?
[14156.93s -> 14158.29s]  I don't think we can show this.
[14158.29s -> 14160.21s]  This is so much.
[14160.21s -> 14160.69s]  Take the kids.
[14160.69s -> 14162.61s]  This is still a week when pants are too...
[14164.45s -> 14165.09s]  Wait a minute.
[14165.09s -> 14166.45s]  Why is he undressing?
[14166.45s -> 14169.17s]  He's like, what's going on?
[14169.25s -> 14170.69s]  These pants are too fucking tight.
[14172.29s -> 14173.01s]  Okay.
[14173.01s -> 14173.97s]  All right, get involved.
[14173.97s -> 14175.73s]  Let's go 13, I'm rooting for you, baby.
[14175.73s -> 14176.53s]  Shut up, Ludwig.
[14176.53s -> 14177.25s]  Oh.
[14177.25s -> 14178.53s]  As soon as you get those pants off.
[14181.41s -> 14183.41s]  13, baby, this is your show.
[14183.41s -> 14184.53s]  Yeah, yeah, fuck you, man.
[14184.53s -> 14184.85s]  Come on.
[14185.57s -> 14186.37s]  New Jerma.
[14186.37s -> 14187.17s]  Guys.
[14187.17s -> 14188.69s]  Wait, I'm getting confused.
[14188.69s -> 14189.81s]  No one's going to replace me.
[14189.81s -> 14190.05s]  Never.
[14190.05s -> 14190.77s]  What's going on?
[14190.77s -> 14191.41s]  Never replace me.
[14192.53s -> 14193.25s]  Wait a second.
[14193.25s -> 14194.77s]  Wait, all right, break it up.
[14194.77s -> 14195.81s]  Real Jerma, come forward.
[14195.81s -> 14196.77s]  Real Jerma, come forward.
[14197.89s -> 14198.85s]  Which one's which?
[14198.85s -> 14199.73s]  Real Jerma, come here.
[14200.29s -> 14200.69s]  What?
[14200.69s -> 14201.81s]  Who wants to sit beside him?
[14201.81s -> 14203.09s]  Hey, there you go.
[14203.09s -> 14203.97s]  That's real Jerma.
[14203.97s -> 14204.69s]  No, no, wait a minute.
[14204.69s -> 14205.49s]  Let's cut this shit.
[14205.49s -> 14205.97s]  He's impossible.
[14205.97s -> 14207.81s]  13, can you stop for a moment?
[14207.81s -> 14208.61s]  He's not fucking 13.
[14208.61s -> 14209.17s]  I'm not Jerma.
[14209.17s -> 14210.85s]  13, can you stop for a moment?
[14210.85s -> 14212.74s]  I'm not retiring.
[14212.74s -> 14213.46s]  He's got to be.
[14213.46s -> 14215.38s]  I'm Jeremy.
[14215.38s -> 14215.70s]  What are you talking about?
[14215.70s -> 14216.18s]  No.
[14216.18s -> 14217.30s]  Don't listen.
[14217.30s -> 14217.62s]  No.
[14217.62s -> 14218.10s]  Come on, guys.
[14218.10s -> 14218.82s]  Can you say something?
[14218.82s -> 14220.10s]  This is the actor, I...
[14220.10s -> 14221.06s]  It's not a real deal.
[14221.06s -> 14223.38s]  Okay, do the thing, do the thing.
[14223.38s -> 14224.02s]  Like, prove it.
[14224.02s -> 14224.58s]  I think I do all the things.
[14224.58s -> 14225.54s]  Do the thing you do, Jerma.
[14225.62s -> 14226.18s]  Do the thing you do.
[14230.02s -> 14231.70s]  I've known you, Dr. Schmoox,
[14231.70s -> 14232.90s]  and I've known you for a long time.
[14232.90s -> 14235.14s]  Yes, it's him.
[14235.14s -> 14235.46s]  What?
[14236.34s -> 14236.74s]  Absolutely.
[14236.74s -> 14239.30s]  No, this guy, you can still see the...
[14242.42s -> 14243.78s]  Peter, six fucking hours.
[14243.78s -> 14245.22s]  We're going to pick this right now.
[14245.22s -> 14245.54s]  Okay?
[14246.02s -> 14246.98s]  No, it's me.
[14246.98s -> 14247.38s]  It's me.
[14247.38s -> 14248.34s]  It's not this idiot.
[14248.34s -> 14249.30s]  Well, we're going to figure out...
[14249.30s -> 14250.50s]  We hired this guy.
[14250.50s -> 14251.62s]  We're going to figure out who it is.
[14252.18s -> 14252.34s]  Okay?
[14252.34s -> 14252.98s]  All right.
[14253.94s -> 14255.46s]  Don't think we need violence.
[14255.46s -> 14256.34s]  That's stupid.
[14256.34s -> 14259.99s]  There is no reason for violence in this place.
[14259.99s -> 14260.79s]  Go out of the way, please.
[14261.51s -> 14261.91s]  All right.
[14263.19s -> 14265.19s]  Please, please, Dr. Schmoox, you know.
[14266.95s -> 14269.75s]  I've known Jerma for 12 years.
[14269.75s -> 14271.51s]  I've known him my whole life.
[14271.51s -> 14272.95s]  I know the real Jerma.
[14272.95s -> 14275.03s]  Stir, stir.
[14275.03s -> 14277.27s]  It's obvious which one's the real one.
[14277.27s -> 14278.63s]  Be cautious with the gun.
[14278.63s -> 14279.51s]  Be cautious with the gun.
[14279.51s -> 14280.23s]  Guys, guys.
[14280.23s -> 14280.63s]  Guns hurt.
[14280.63s -> 14281.27s]  Look at me.
[14281.27s -> 14281.75s]  You know?
[14281.75s -> 14282.39s]  Look at me.
[14282.39s -> 14282.95s]  Guns hurt.
[14282.95s -> 14284.39s]  Stir, I've known him for 10 years.
[14284.39s -> 14285.03s]  We've...
[14285.03s -> 14286.15s]  TF2 and...
[14286.15s -> 14286.63s]  Look at me.
[14287.43s -> 14287.99s]  Look at me.
[14287.99s -> 14288.55s]  That's me.
[14288.55s -> 14289.91s]  Jerma, I just want you to know.
[14289.91s -> 14290.95s]  You can Google all that.
[14290.95s -> 14291.67s]  He knows nothing.
[14291.67s -> 14293.67s]  I could tell who it was the whole time.
[14293.67s -> 14293.83s]  What?
[14297.33s -> 14298.34s]  You shot...
[14299.54s -> 14300.26s]  You shot him.
[14305.12s -> 14307.84s]  You...
[14307.84s -> 14308.32s]  Fuck.
[14308.32s -> 14310.68s]  I'm going to haunt you for the rest of my life.
[14311.40s -> 14312.68s]  Don't listen to this fraud.
[14313.80s -> 14315.24s]  Somebody call an ambulance.
[14315.24s -> 14316.28s]  No, we don't need it.
[14316.28s -> 14317.24s]  No, you're a doctor.
[14317.24s -> 14318.20s]  Just go help us.
[14318.20s -> 14319.24s]  Hey, it's all right.
[14319.24s -> 14320.60s]  We shot the fake Jerma.
[14320.60s -> 14321.40s]  Real Jerma, you...
[14321.40s -> 14321.96s]  We can't...
[14321.96s -> 14322.84s]  You're back, baby.
[14322.84s -> 14323.48s]  We can't...
[14323.48s -> 14325.24s]  I'm sorry he tried to mess with you.
[14325.24s -> 14326.44s]  I'm sorry he tried to mess with you.
[14327.56s -> 14328.36s]  I don't know.
[14328.36s -> 14328.84s]  He did a...
[14330.60s -> 14331.64s]  Okay, Jerma.
[14331.64s -> 14333.32s]  You can't do this.
[14335.14s -> 14335.62s]  Well, guys...
[14336.82s -> 14337.62s]  New Jerma.
[14337.62s -> 14338.34s]  Real Jerma.
[14338.34s -> 14339.30s]  Real Jerma.
[14339.30s -> 14340.18s]  Real Jerma.
[14340.98s -> 14341.38s]  Dead Jerma.
[14341.38s -> 14342.74s]  Let's get this imposter out of here.
[14342.74s -> 14343.38s]  Dead Jerma.
[14343.38s -> 14344.10s]  Dead Jerma.
[14346.77s -> 14348.05s]  Oh my god.
[14348.05s -> 14348.53s]  Do the thing.
[14350.05s -> 14351.05s]  Yeah.
[14352.07s -> 14352.57s]  Yeah.
[14353.51s -> 14354.55s]  That's my Jerma.
[14355.27s -> 14356.47s]  That's my Jerma.
[14356.47s -> 14357.27s]  I guess so.
[14357.27s -> 14358.39s]  9.85.
[14358.39s -> 14360.15s]  All right, 9.85.
[14360.15s -> 14361.27s]  A hot cup of shite on you.
[14362.15s -> 14362.65s]  Yeah.
[14363.35s -> 14363.85s]  Yeah.
[14364.23s -> 14365.27s]  This guy.
[14365.27s -> 14365.77s]  Hit it.
[14366.79s -> 14370.12s]  We're looking forward to playing lots of Minecraft.
[14371.24s -> 14372.04s]  Epic fails.
[14373.08s -> 14374.28s]  Even more epic crimes.
[14375.97s -> 14376.69s]  What can I say?
[14376.69s -> 14377.65s]  What can I say?
[14377.65s -> 14378.85s]  Epic fails and fun.
[14379.73s -> 14380.69s]  German bag, baby.
[14381.65s -> 14383.94s]  I'm glad we got that imposter, though.
[14383.94s -> 14385.22s]  That was scary.
[14385.22s -> 14388.02s]  I think we're clear.
