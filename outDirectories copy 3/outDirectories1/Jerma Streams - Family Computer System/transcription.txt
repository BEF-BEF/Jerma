[0.57s -> 2.84s]  How are you doing?
[2.84s -> 8.02s]  How are we? Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, now we're good.
[8.02s -> 13.27s]  What's going on? Happy New Year, everybody.
[13.99s -> 21.22s]  Officially, right? Last time I saw you, it was still December 31st, Pacific time.
[24.81s -> 30.39s]  Catboy. Yeah, I know, I know. Look. Look.
[31.46s -> 33.94s]  I didn't tell you when I had that- I didn't say,
[33.94s -> 37.38s]  hey guys, the next stream is gonna be me in a catboy outfit.
[38.65s -> 41.61s]  I just said, at some point, over the years,
[43.10s -> 46.62s]  over the years, I was gonna get into a catboy costume.
[47.42s -> 50.04s]  No, it has to happen this year. Don't worry.
[54.54s -> 56.86s]  It's gonna happen in the next- Okay, I'll give you a-
[58.46s -> 61.42s]  Look, it's gonna happen in the next, like, three to six months, okay?
[63.61s -> 66.49s]  I didn't say I'm gonna wear a catboy costume next weekend.
[69.35s -> 70.71s]  You won't even know when it's gonna happen.
[72.44s -> 75.96s]  It's just going to one day. And I don't want you to know the date.
[81.03s -> 87.53s]  Scammed? Dude, chat is in shambles right now.
[92.06s -> 94.06s]  But yeah, hopefully you had a good New Year's Eve.
[94.62s -> 98.55s]  I bought you for Eastern time, but took off around 10 or 11 PM Pacific.
[99.27s -> 109.26s]  And today, we're gonna do something that I haven't really done on this channel before.
[109.98s -> 114.28s]  I mean, I've kind of done a version of it, but I saw this little device,
[115.08s -> 118.20s]  and I had to have it, and I have to play it.
[120.07s -> 126.36s]  This is a knockoff Nintendo. It's shaped like the Nintendo.
[127.00s -> 129.32s]  It looks like the Nintendo. I just had to own it.
[131.11s -> 134.95s]  There are 620 fake Nintendo games on this console.
[135.75s -> 143.62s]  I don't know how many of them are real. I just saw this and I had to get it.
[143.62s -> 147.06s]  I've seen Vinny do this shit before. I've seen Joel do this shit before.
[147.06s -> 148.74s]  And these are usually a fucking mess.
[149.86s -> 152.66s]  They are the kings of these devices, I would say.
[152.66s -> 154.66s]  I'm just a measly peasant in their presence.
[156.44s -> 159.24s]  So I have no idea what this one is. I just saw it and I had to buy it.
[166.02s -> 169.30s]  Yeah, I've done the 700,000 games before, but never a-
[169.30s -> 171.06s]  Never like one you just plug into your TV.
[174.71s -> 176.55s]  Eat a Whopper? Tomorrow's the Whopper stream.
[177.19s -> 178.31s]  I gotta tweet this stream out. Hold on.
[178.87s -> 182.70s]  Yeah, this is called the Family Computer System.
[185.96s -> 187.32s]  Yeah, tomorrow is Whopper's stream.
[193.82s -> 196.38s]  A few weeks ago, I played that game, Black Masses,
[196.38s -> 200.38s]  and that joke is gonna happen tomorrow.
[200.38s -> 203.18s]  So a bunch of people probably have no idea what's gonna happen with that
[203.74s -> 204.86s]  routine, in quotes.
[205.58s -> 208.81s]  But for those of you that were there, cool.
[209.37s -> 210.89s]  I think I'm gonna have fun. I don't even care.
[212.60s -> 213.16s]  Oh, my God.
[215.26s -> 216.46s]  I can't fucking wait.
[216.46s -> 218.54s]  That's gonna be like my favorite stream of the year.
[219.26s -> 225.91s]  Part of me only wants that stream to be an hour long.
[226.81s -> 227.77s]  It's just the whole thing.
[228.41s -> 230.70s]  But we'll see. I don't know.
[230.70s -> 232.22s]  Let's see how much that makes me laugh.
[233.02s -> 236.34s]  Catboy stream.
[236.34s -> 237.86s]  You'll get the Catboy stream.
[238.42s -> 241.94s]  Okay, guys, okay, let me just break this down for you.
[242.98s -> 247.11s]  So yesterday, two days ago was New Year's Day.
[248.47s -> 251.43s]  But you expected me to go get an entire Catboy costume
[251.43s -> 255.59s]  and have Catboy makeup put on me in 24 hours?
[259.53s -> 261.69s]  No, I'm doing this legit.
[261.69s -> 264.41s]  I'm not just gonna go get a pair of ears at the dollar store, okay?
[265.21s -> 268.70s]  Just hold on, give me some time.
[275.22s -> 276.10s]  He's dedicated.
[277.66s -> 283.11s]  Yeah, well, it's gonna be my version of that image.
[283.83s -> 285.03s]  All right, let's go.
[285.03s -> 285.83s]  Let's play.
[285.83s -> 286.55s]  It's time to play.
[289.59s -> 291.67s]  So this is gonna be an interesting thing we do here.
[291.67s -> 294.23s]  I'm just gonna play this the way that I'm gonna play it on the screen right now,
[294.23s -> 296.07s]  or two random number generators.
[298.06s -> 300.46s]  Remember, there are 620 on this console.
[302.81s -> 306.01s]  And how this is gonna work is I'm going to roll this.
[306.01s -> 307.53s]  This is just whatever this lands on.
[307.53s -> 308.73s]  This is what I'm gonna play.
[308.73s -> 310.36s]  And whatever one this is on,
[310.36s -> 313.34s]  this is the amount of time I have to play it in minutes, okay?
[314.33s -> 315.61s]  People say, show the console, sure.
[317.22s -> 319.62s]  I'll show the family computer system.
[319.62s -> 327.14s]  So here it is.
[327.14s -> 329.38s]  Is it right here?
[330.31s -> 330.87s]  Can you see it?
[332.39s -> 334.07s]  Not the Nintendo Entertainment System,
[334.07s -> 339.37s]  the family computer system.
[339.37s -> 343.27s]  So, you know, well, hopefully this is fun.
[347.16s -> 350.92s]  I have to delay my audio by almost two and a half full seconds, by the way,
[350.92s -> 354.15s]  to be able to stream this and capture it.
[354.79s -> 357.43s]  So we might be completely out of sync right now.
[357.43s -> 358.71s]  I have no idea.
[358.71s -> 360.15s]  I tried desperately.
[360.15s -> 360.87s]  Let's test it.
[360.87s -> 362.79s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[362.79s -> 363.69s]  How's that?
[363.69s -> 364.89s]  Do I have to adjust it?
[364.89s -> 368.49s]  One, two, three, four.
[368.49s -> 375.70s]  One, two, three, four, one.
[375.70s -> 376.18s]  Good?
[376.18s -> 377.06s]  All right, let's go.
[377.06s -> 378.34s]  All right, good, good, good, good.
[378.34s -> 379.62s]  All right, so what do we got first?
[379.62s -> 387.56s]  The first one we're going to play, we're going to go to 162.
[387.56s -> 391.93s]  And I have to play 162 for two minutes.
[391.93s -> 392.49s]  Okay, good.
[392.49s -> 392.97s]  That's good.
[392.97s -> 396.49s]  All right, let's go to 162.
[396.49s -> 400.81s]  By the way, Mortal Kombat 4 with a C.
[400.81s -> 403.38s]  That's, I mean, there's a lot here.
[403.38s -> 403.86s]  Oh, what is it?
[403.86s -> 404.66s]  162?
[408.42s -> 409.46s]  162.
[413.18s -> 414.54s]  This one's called Duck.
[415.40s -> 416.44s]  This might be just Duck Hunt.
[416.44s -> 417.48s]  Oh, I'll show the controller too.
[417.48s -> 419.46s]  The controller's funny.
[419.46s -> 422.12s]  Look at this fucking thing.
[422.12s -> 425.96s]  So it looks kind of normal until they decided to add, like, mirror buttons.
[425.96s -> 428.25s]  They'll look here.
[432.86s -> 433.90s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[433.90s -> 438.07s]  There's just four buttons.
[438.07s -> 441.51s]  And it's A, B, T, A, and T, B.
[441.51s -> 444.55s]  And I tried to read the instruction manual to find out what the fuck that meant.
[444.55s -> 451.27s]  I have no idea what that means.
[451.27s -> 457.29s]  It gives, like, an incredibly unclear explanation of what that actually is.
[457.29s -> 457.69s]  Turbo?
[457.69s -> 458.81s]  Yeah, but it doesn't do anything.
[458.81s -> 461.22s]  All right, let's go to Duck.
[461.22s -> 463.98s]  It's time for Duck, and I got to play this for two minutes.
[463.98s -> 466.54s]  By the way, when I get to a point where I want to see
[466.54s -> 468.62s]  times up spammed in chat, please.
[468.62s -> 470.54s]  When I get the time, I probably shouldn't have told you to do that.
[470.54s -> 471.26s]  Whatever, Duck.
[471.26s -> 475.16s]  I already love it.
[475.16s -> 480.04s]  It's like Dig Dug?
[480.04s -> 482.70s]  Oh, shit, I got to get these off screen.
[485.38s -> 486.10s]  Stage one.
[487.00s -> 487.64s]  Duck.
[487.64s -> 490.06s]  How do you play?
[490.62s -> 497.18s]  I win?
[497.18s -> 499.90s]  Oh, okay, you have to bring the egg to the bottom.
[499.90s -> 501.18s]  Oh, it is like Dig Dug.
[501.98s -> 502.90s]  Did I lose?
[502.90s -> 503.78s]  Oh, shit, okay, hold on.
[504.34s -> 507.58s]  This is cute, man.
[507.58s -> 508.70s]  This is not even, like, bad.
[509.26s -> 510.14s]  This is, like, fun.
[510.86s -> 513.91s]  What is it?
[513.91s -> 514.55s]  Is it a dog?
[517.05s -> 518.01s]  It's times up.
[518.57s -> 519.85s]  It's not times up yet.
[520.57s -> 524.63s]  Oh, the egg broke.
[524.63s -> 526.47s]  Okay, you can't drop that far.
[527.27s -> 528.86s]  I got one more minute.
[528.86s -> 530.78s]  I have one minute left in Duck.
[531.50s -> 535.86s]  All right, don't touch the green stuff.
[536.42s -> 537.14s]  Wait, does it matter?
[537.78s -> 539.37s]  Because it can't fall that far.
[539.93s -> 543.16s]  All right, let's get a heart.
[543.16s -> 545.91s]  Oops, oops.
[545.91s -> 550.02s]  I didn't know Jerma was a retro gamer.
[550.66s -> 552.20s]  Oh, I think I blew it.
[552.92s -> 553.80s]  Did I blow it?
[558.09s -> 559.77s]  No, I'm not done with Duck yet.
[559.77s -> 560.97s]  I'm not done, I'm not done, I'm not done.
[560.97s -> 562.49s]  I want to get to the bottom of Duck.
[562.49s -> 562.89s]  Hold on.
[563.69s -> 564.73s]  I like this one.
[567.11s -> 567.83s]  Times up.
[567.83s -> 568.39s]  It doesn't matter.
[569.86s -> 570.90s]  Oh my god, I get times up.
[570.90s -> 575.16s]  Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, time's up.
[575.16s -> 575.72s]  God damn it.
[575.72s -> 576.68s]  I wanted to play that one.
[576.68s -> 577.32s]  Maybe I'll go back.
[577.32s -> 578.60s]  Okay, keep Duck on the list.
[579.32s -> 580.58s]  All right, what's up?
[580.58s -> 580.98s]  What's next?
[583.37s -> 586.49s]  All right, 169 for seven minutes.
[588.97s -> 589.85s]  169.
[590.73s -> 592.01s]  What the hell is random number generator?
[597.56s -> 600.70s]  169 is gyrodine.
[600.70s -> 604.15s]  And I see right now it is almost 11 minutes.
[604.15s -> 606.55s]  So at 18 minutes is when I have to stop playing this.
[606.55s -> 608.55s]  This is, I probably should have made it five minutes,
[608.55s -> 610.31s]  but whatever, I have to sleep in the bed that I made.
[611.54s -> 621.00s]  Okay, gyrodine in three, two, one, go.
[621.00s -> 623.67s]  Okay, gyrodine.
[623.67s -> 628.52s]  Whatever, what's going on?
[629.08s -> 631.80s]  Oh, it's a helicopter auto-scroller.
[633.78s -> 634.10s]  Shit.
[635.06s -> 638.82s]  How do I kill things?
[638.82s -> 639.70s]  I can't hurt anything?
[642.55s -> 643.27s]  What?
[643.27s -> 648.47s]  Why can't, why do my bullets not hurt stuff?
[648.47s -> 649.19s]  Is it over?
[649.19s -> 653.69s]  That sucks.
[653.69s -> 655.21s]  It's like a laser tag weapon.
[656.25s -> 657.21s]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[657.21s -> 658.57s]  Okay, I was pressing, wait.
[658.57s -> 659.67s]  There's two guns.
[659.67s -> 661.11s]  There's this one, this is just lights,
[661.11s -> 664.22s]  and this one is real bullets.
[664.22s -> 665.18s]  No, it's not.
[665.18s -> 666.38s]  Oh, that's the ground.
[666.38s -> 668.46s]  Holy shit, okay, this is air and this is ground.
[668.46s -> 671.37s]  How am I shooting the cars?
[673.21s -> 675.29s]  Oh, fuck man, gyrodine's pretty good.
[675.29s -> 677.38s]  I'm liking gyrodine so far.
[677.94s -> 689.75s]  They just look like crumpled up pieces of paper.
[689.75s -> 694.82s]  I wonder if this is a boss.
[694.82s -> 699.74s]  I mean, this is just somebody sketched these in five seconds.
[699.74s -> 700.78s]  I can do this.
[700.78s -> 702.06s]  I can sketch these tanks.
[702.06s -> 706.22s]  They're not even symmetrical either.
[706.22s -> 707.34s]  Oh shit, watch out, jets.
[710.82s -> 714.07s]  I can't fucking believe I just lost right there.
[714.07s -> 714.63s]  God damn it.
[714.63s -> 715.59s]  Please spawn right here.
[715.59s -> 716.39s]  Oh my God.
[716.39s -> 718.07s]  Wait, no, no, it's like a checkpoint.
[718.07s -> 722.63s]  Just play Ace Combat instead.
[722.63s -> 734.66s]  You can't really compare gyrodine to Ace Combat.
[734.66s -> 736.10s]  Oh my fucking God.
[736.10s -> 738.58s]  No, it's the control is hard.
[738.58s -> 740.74s]  Why can't you, why can't, why not?
[740.74s -> 747.59s]  Well, because the Ace Combat is a,
[747.59s -> 750.73s]  this game was made in probably 30 minutes.
[750.73s -> 753.69s]  Ace Combat has a team of like 200 people that worked on it.
[753.69s -> 755.45s]  For like four years.
[755.45s -> 763.45s]  You don't just take raw hamburger meat out of the refrigerator.
[763.45s -> 765.56s]  Put it on a plate and say,
[765.56s -> 770.84s]  this is the same thing as the five-star restaurant.
[771.64s -> 773.72s]  Eat my fucking hamburger meat instead.
[773.72s -> 781.22s]  I have literally no idea what that meant, by the way.
[781.22s -> 783.62s]  Like I have no idea what that meant.
[784.95s -> 786.23s]  I said what I, the sentence I just said,
[786.23s -> 788.39s]  I'm saying it like internally in my head now.
[788.39s -> 790.95s]  And like the point I was trying to make is kind of there somewhere,
[790.95s -> 792.39s]  but like I don't know where it was.
[792.39s -> 793.27s]  It was in there somewhere.
[794.49s -> 796.89s]  If you deconstruct that whole sentence,
[796.89s -> 798.89s]  you'll be able to like find out what I was trying to say.
[802.60s -> 804.78s]  It was in there somewhere.
[804.78s -> 805.58s]  He's zonked.
[805.58s -> 807.26s]  No, I'm not, not today.
[807.26s -> 813.06s]  Stop drinking bong water.
[813.06s -> 814.58s]  All right, if I don't get to the end,
[814.66s -> 815.86s]  I'm going to be very mad.
[815.86s -> 817.66s]  This is not even hard.
[817.66s -> 826.52s]  Like I played like 4,000 hours of Binding of Isaac.
[827.32s -> 829.48s]  I can't beat Gyrodyne.
[829.48s -> 840.92s]  I mean, the controller is kind of hard to use.
[840.92s -> 843.03s]  Oh my God, give me a break.
[843.03s -> 843.75s]  Fuck this game.
[844.31s -> 844.87s]  It sucks.
[846.02s -> 846.58s]  Never mind.
[846.58s -> 847.06s]  It's funny.
[851.40s -> 852.68s]  These are excuses.
[852.68s -> 854.38s]  No, they're not.
[854.38s -> 857.59s]  They're...
[857.59s -> 860.39s]  Look, all right, the controller sucks.
[861.34s -> 863.50s]  I press left and sometimes it doesn't go left.
[863.50s -> 864.62s]  Sometimes it just sits there.
[867.69s -> 870.97s]  They 3D printed these controllers, like a thousand of them.
[870.97s -> 877.80s]  It's hard to use.
[877.80s -> 879.24s]  It's fucking hard to do.
[879.24s -> 882.94s]  How much more time is left on this one?
[882.94s -> 886.71s]  Two minutes?
[886.71s -> 887.43s]  All right, whatever.
[887.43s -> 887.91s]  I got it.
[891.82s -> 892.22s]  You know what?
[892.22s -> 893.02s]  Right works fine.
[893.02s -> 893.74s]  Up works fine.
[893.74s -> 894.54s]  Down works fine.
[894.54s -> 895.34s]  It's left.
[895.34s -> 896.54s]  Left like doesn't want to...
[896.54s -> 898.22s]  If you have to push hard.
[898.22s -> 905.54s]  There's a dev in the chat.
[905.54s -> 908.10s]  Well, I highly doubt that.
[908.10s -> 910.66s]  I'm trying to pick up the mermaid and it got me killed.
[910.66s -> 914.26s]  I can't even get past the first two screens of Gyrodyne.
[914.26s -> 915.70s]  This is making me angry.
[915.70s -> 920.98s]  Dev of Gyrodyne.
[926.79s -> 928.23s]  Why am I tapping when I could just be holding?
[932.44s -> 933.40s]  Stop pretending.
[936.12s -> 937.24s]  I'm not pretending.
[937.24s -> 937.72s]  It's hard.
[943.78s -> 947.06s]  You get on General Mills presents Gyrodyne,
[947.06s -> 951.54s]  and you tell me how difficult it is to move around.
[964.50s -> 965.14s]  There you go.
[965.14s -> 967.11s]  There you go.
[967.11s -> 967.75s]  Watch out, watch out.
[970.36s -> 972.60s]  Hurry, do the famous Gyrodyne cheat code.
[972.60s -> 973.88s]  Oh, you're right.
[973.88s -> 975.64s]  Up, up, down, down, down, up, up, up, down, down, down.
[975.64s -> 977.96s]  B, A, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, A, B, A.
[977.96s -> 979.16s]  Left, right, left, right, left, right.
[979.16s -> 984.04s]  B, A, B, B, A, back, B, I, B, O, B, O, B, O, B.
[984.04s -> 987.91s]  Did I get it?
[987.91s -> 989.35s]  No, I was too slow.
[989.35s -> 1003.51s]  I really don't want to be playing Gyrodyne anymore.
[1003.51s -> 1005.14s]  We're going to follow the rules.
[1005.14s -> 1006.18s]  I can't break the rules.
[1006.18s -> 1011.58s]  I have to keep playing.
[1011.58s -> 1012.22s]  30 seconds.
[1012.22s -> 1012.38s]  All right.
[1012.38s -> 1014.54s]  This is going to be the last life, so I better make it count.
[1014.54s -> 1019.90s]  I'm just going to dodge and not care about anything but dodging.
[1019.90s -> 1022.39s]  But I move slower than they do.
[1022.39s -> 1023.43s]  That's why this is so difficult.
[1023.43s -> 1025.38s]  I move slower than the bullets.
[1025.38s -> 1026.82s]  I move slower than all the other things.
[1026.82s -> 1027.54s]  And I made it.
[1027.54s -> 1036.79s]  I made it, I'm good.
[1036.79s -> 1039.51s]  I feel like I'm looking at the Chrono Trigger overworld map.
[1039.51s -> 1043.74s]  God, that makes me want to play that game. Let's just play that game tomorrow. No, no, no, no, no
[1043.74s -> 1054.97s]  No, don't lie to them. Don't lie to them. They'll fucking sniff you out. Don't lie to them. Where are these cars driving?
[1054.97s -> 1059.11s]  Why are they driving up here?
[1059.11s -> 1066.49s]  Off-road, I guess. All right. Oh, I made it. It's the first I've ever been in Jaredine. I can't even see the bullets
[1066.81s -> 1073.53s]  Wow, it looks so much better on your guy's screen. I'm not even kidding from my monitor
[1073.53s -> 1078.42s]  It looks like dog shit, but on your on your screen. It looks wicked good on my screen
[1078.42s -> 1083.22s]  It looks like shit when it's why is it? Why is that? How can your screen look so much better than my screen?
[1083.30s -> 1091.77s]  Whatever. No, it really does. I couldn't see those bullets. I looked over at my preview monitor
[1091.77s -> 1101.21s]  I can see them clearly and we're going next. It was Jaredine. It was pretty sick. There we go. 299 for
[1102.52s -> 1118.42s]  Three minutes. Okay, I can do that. 299 pong pong for three minutes. All right, let's play pong pong
[1121.51s -> 1127.67s]  I'm gonna start the uh, so 1930. Let's start and I'm gonna guess this is pong
[1129.02s -> 1133.50s]  If it's not pong then I don't know what it is pong pong stage one
[1136.97s -> 1145.45s]  Um, what the fuck is happening? What am I driving? Am I a car? Okay. I'm orange car
[1146.87s -> 1149.67s]  I have a bullets or guns or anything. Is it just bumper cars?
[1151.22s -> 1156.15s]  Wait a minute. Is this just a mario party game where you have to bump like yoshi and luigi off the edge
[1160.82s -> 1167.74s]  I think that's what this is. I don't
[1169.66s -> 1172.86s]  I don't know what the goal is
[1173.10s -> 1175.10s]  I have to just dump them into the corners
[1179.40s -> 1181.56s]  I don't have no fucking idea of it
[1183.74s -> 1185.74s]  Uh, what if I drive into one?
[1187.99s -> 1193.35s]  Oh, I was killed but I can't look at when I bump into them they don't go the direction you think they're gonna go
[1196.30s -> 1198.30s]  This doesn't make any fucking sense
[1198.54s -> 1200.62s]  I don't have any bullets or anything either
[1207.42s -> 1209.82s]  See like you think they would they would bounce backwards
[1211.08s -> 1213.08s]  But i'm I go for much
[1218.76s -> 1222.52s]  Why did I switch with him? What the what how is that even fucking possible?
[1223.24s -> 1225.11s]  What?
[1225.11s -> 1230.63s]  We switched places
[1230.63s -> 1237.54s]  Get in there
[1237.54s -> 1246.04s]  Oh, I don't have to do it. Wait, there's two more left. Hey jerma, i'm the dev of what is what is this?
[1246.28s -> 1248.60s]  I look honestly. I don't care what's happening in the game right now. I'm gonna read this
[1250.63s -> 1254.07s]  Hey, i'm the dev of jarodon. This game was the work of two years of work with myself another dev
[1254.15s -> 1257.27s]  He ended up with my wife and I lost custody of my children. Okay. Well
[1267.50s -> 1271.42s]  I'm the dev of jarodon. All right, it's not even careful. How much time is left 19
[1272.38s -> 1274.38s]  20 21 22. I have like 40 seconds
[1285.11s -> 1287.27s]  This is by far the worst one yet. This is the worst one yet
[1288.47s -> 1298.63s]  I cannot bump them when I get close enough. I just I switch places with them 22 30, right? All right
[1298.63s -> 1300.55s]  I don't even care. I'm just gonna wait
[1300.55s -> 1302.55s]  This was I don't even with pong
[1302.81s -> 1304.81s]  ping pong pong pong
[1307.16s -> 1309.16s]  Worst two out of three. All right, let's go
[1311.32s -> 1323.18s]  What we got coming up next is 223 for five minutes. Just get rid of the timer
[1324.10s -> 1330.33s]  That was not three minutes. Yeah, it was 19 20 21 22. All right, 223 for five minutes
[1332.79s -> 1336.98s]  Don't get rid of the timer. I'm just gonna leave it for now. There's like 600 games
[1337.06s -> 1345.77s]  I figured we'd do something interesting for the first like hour or two. All right, 223 is
[1346.41s -> 1348.81s]  Spy versus I want to play spy versus spy right now
[1349.99s -> 1356.94s]  223 is called five days. I'll have five minutes to do five days
[1362.36s -> 1366.60s]  So we're at i'm looking at the stream time right now. We're at 23 minutes and just about 30 seconds
[1366.60s -> 1369.59s]  So five minutes from right now five days
[1371.10s -> 1385.42s]  Okay, five nights at freddy's. All right. Do I okay? I'm just shooting. I can't really aim at them
[1385.90s -> 1389.13s]  I feel like this is how I end up playing x-com
[1394.23s -> 1396.23s]  Oh my fucking god. Okay
[1400.76s -> 1406.42s]  I can't shoot them at an angle. I have to do this for five full days
[1410.58s -> 1412.58s]  How come I just turned them green?
[1413.96s -> 1415.96s]  I can't even aim that direction
[1416.20s -> 1421.88s]  I can only aim aim at specific angles
[1426.42s -> 1433.46s]  I'm not doing that bad
[1434.02s -> 1436.02s]  Drive me fucking crazy
[1442.09s -> 1446.41s]  I feel like i'm playing like an old nintendo scary horror game like maniac mansion
[1447.29s -> 1449.85s]  And the title screen glitched out and it's just repeating
[1452.81s -> 1460.68s]  The cd just is skipping
[1460.68s -> 1463.08s]  Oh, wait, this guy's uh red
[1463.72s -> 1466.39s]  orange
[1466.39s -> 1467.99s]  He was one hit
[1467.99s -> 1469.43s]  Is he just faster?
[1469.43s -> 1477.51s]  This is penis music
[1477.51s -> 1483.70s]  No
[1483.70s -> 1485.30s]  All right
[1485.30s -> 1487.94s]  I'm gonna do i'm done. This is stupid
[1493.22s -> 1499.06s]  Just stop. Yeah, i'm down with this one. I don't even care. I don't care. I can't take this one anymore. I don't care
[1502.78s -> 1505.16s]  Now where we going next?
[1505.16s -> 1508.68s]  The tire no the time. Yeah, fuck the tire the tires. I don't care
[1509.16s -> 1513.08s]  Broke the rules already. I don't care like fuck the timer if it sucks. I don't want to burn my brain
[1516.14s -> 1520.06s]  seven minutes
[1520.06s -> 1521.08s]  All right
[1521.08s -> 1523.08s]  397 is what is it?
[1524.22s -> 1526.70s]  You have to follow the rules 397
[1529.14s -> 1534.02s]  Dr mario, this is a classic. This actually might just be dr mario, by the way
[1534.58s -> 1542.30s]  So do not be surprised if it's just just they just ripped it and put it on here. They did I think
[1543.98s -> 1545.98s]  virus level
[1545.98s -> 1547.98s]  speed music type
[1550.25s -> 1552.01s]  um, okay
[1552.01s -> 1554.01s]  I have a confession to make for all of you watching
[1554.89s -> 1559.61s]  I have no idea how to play dr mario. I don't even I don't understand it. I don't get it at all
[1559.69s -> 1561.85s]  I don't i've never played it more than five seconds at a time
[1565.32s -> 1568.44s]  I have to match like the colors right somehow
[1569.37s -> 1574.94s]  And you get rid of the aliens. I think that's how you play
[1578.79s -> 1581.35s]  And then I can attach it to here and then kill right?
[1582.23s -> 1585.75s]  Is this the game? This is actually dr mario or is it like a weird bootleg version of it?
[1588.73s -> 1594.87s]  Um, oops, there you go. That's fucking best gamer moment. Fuck 2020 moment right there if I ever see one
[1597.46s -> 1607.83s]  I have to attach this to oops. Oh, I fucked it up. It's over. What am I? Oh my god
[1607.91s -> 1615.19s]  I can't I hate these kind of games. I can't I do not like tetris style games
[1615.43s -> 1619.42s]  I can't do them. I get so impatient because the thing goes so slow
[1619.50s -> 1623.18s]  It just trickles down like one two three, but i'm like hurry get the fuck down there
[1623.66s -> 1636.15s]  I have to like think on the fly. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I don't want to do that. Oh fuck. I'm in trouble
[1638.58s -> 1642.02s]  No, I can't I can't do it gotta go fast. There's no car I can drive. I don't like it
[1642.78s -> 1647.11s]  I don't like it. There's no car to drive. I don't like it. I'm so impatient. I'm so fucked up
[1647.19s -> 1652.06s]  I can't do it. I'm too fucked up to play these games. I can't do it
[1654.68s -> 1662.12s]  I can't do it. I'm too fucked. This is why I got like an f in geometry and shit like every year
[1662.20s -> 1669.75s]  I can't play these games, but I can sing though. Okay, that's worth something
[1672.10s -> 1676.39s]  Fuck i'm so screwed
[1677.35s -> 1679.59s]  Imagine being in like
[1679.59s -> 1686.79s]  Junior high school or high school or something and you get your your test back from the teacher and they're like, oh, uh, jeremy
[1686.79s -> 1691.35s]  Yeah, you didn't like you messed this all up. You didn't like do this correctly. The the angles are all wrong
[1691.91s -> 1697.03s]  Um, maybe could you come after class? Maybe like we could do some tutoring. Excuse me teacher. I can sing though
[1701.50s -> 1710.94s]  That's how you get to the office. Oh, I can sing though. Okay teachers like I don't care cool. That's like great
[1711.82s -> 1718.84s]  I'll get it this time. What a horrible excuse for every scenario
[1721.85s -> 1726.57s]  Mr. Albertson just want to let you know your blood pressure is a little high and your cholesterol is a little high too
[1727.22s -> 1729.85s]  Hey doc, I can sing though. Okay
[1730.33s -> 1731.13s]  uh
[1731.13s -> 1733.10s]  Good good
[1733.10s -> 1743.59s]  Start eating Cheerios and stop ordering fucking hamburgers from uber eats every day. I've made no progress. What's happening?
[1751.11s -> 1753.11s]  But I don't understand like what you're supposed to do in dr
[1753.11s -> 1758.95s]  Mario I get the concept but like I don't I don't care like, you know when you just don't care
[1759.83s -> 1762.71s]  And that's why you can't do it because I just don't care. You know what I mean?
[1764.82s -> 1768.58s]  How many you guys like do you like you staticians and should have looked at this going like oh man
[1768.66s -> 1770.34s]  You see this like wait, you gotta put them right over there
[1770.34s -> 1772.34s]  You could have been over there the blue could have gone over that way
[1773.32s -> 1775.32s]  I don't care. I can sing
[1776.17s -> 1784.49s]  I'm done
[1784.49s -> 1798.86s]  80 uh 88 what's 88? Uh bomber man. Okay, so it's bomber man for a maximum amount of
[1799.67s -> 1804.95s]  Two. All right. No, fuck the timer. I don't care. I was playing until I don't care anymore bomber man
[1809.77s -> 1812.73s]  Is it actual bomber man? Let's see
[1815.43s -> 1817.51s]  um
[1817.51s -> 1820.90s]  Kind of I want to say kind of
[1827.61s -> 1829.61s]  Is this what the original one looks like?
[1834.74s -> 1838.78s]  It's dead
[1838.78s -> 1844.25s]  This is what the original game looks like. Is it I don't think i've ever played the original
[1847.85s -> 1862.39s]  This is actually literally just bomber man. Is it? Oh, holy shit. Cool. This one's fun. I like bomber man
[1862.95s -> 1864.95s]  You know, I used to play bomber man 64
[1864.95s -> 1870.63s]  And bomber man 64 had a very surprisingly fun party game mode where you could have like four people
[1872.42s -> 1874.66s]  It was like a battle system. It was awesome
[1875.06s -> 1899.58s]  Come on go get him. I just didn't kill myself today. Okay good. Oh, why are you avoiding me so well?
[1903.50s -> 1905.99s]  There it is. Got him. Oh my god
[1906.07s -> 1908.50s]  This guy sucks at bomber man
[1908.98s -> 1911.16s]  It doesn't care
[1911.16s -> 1914.12s]  Does that really matter? Okay in in the year 2020
[1914.44s -> 1920.15s]  Does it matter if I can't do the original bomber man very well? I'm gonna die get out what?
[1931.54s -> 1933.62s]  It's funny. Whatever. It's been two days
[1938.52s -> 1943.96s]  You have a certain amount of time to be able to say it's still 2020. Yeah, you get that you get some leeway there
[1943.96s -> 1958.50s]  It's been two days three thirty six. What's three thirty six? It's been three days. Yeah, but whatever it's three days
[1958.50s -> 1962.74s]  So people are oh, yeah, man still saying 2020 shit people still do that shit in march
[1962.82s -> 1963.46s]  Okay
[1963.46s -> 1970.33s]  How many times people when they sign in somewhere or they write something and they have to look up to the clerk or right?
[1970.41s -> 1972.41s]  I look up to the cashier and go, uh
[1973.48s -> 1977.72s]  I don't have any idea what today is or what day it is what time it is and the person has to go
[1977.80s -> 1984.62s]  Oh, it's um, yeah, it's one four twenty twenty one guys every single time
[1984.62s -> 1987.42s]  I filled out a piece of paper where there was a clerk in front of me
[1987.74s -> 1990.06s]  They had to tell me what the date was every single time
[1990.06s -> 1997.02s]  I never know what day it is and sometimes they have to tell me twice because they'll say that. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[1997.02s -> 2003.18s]  Yeah, yeah, four five twenty twenty. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Cool. Thank you and I fill out the paper and then I have to go

[2041.88s -> 2043.16s]  among us
[2043.16s -> 2045.16s]  Chess was huge for a while
[2045.32s -> 2049.64s]  Rust is getting big right now. The next one's gonna be battleship. It's gonna be fucking battleship
[2050.74s -> 2052.90s]  It will be huge drama around battleship
[2053.62s -> 2056.18s]  Within the next six months. I guarantee it
[2057.27s -> 2063.08s]  100 guarantee it
[2063.08s -> 2068.50s]  You come to me you come to me when i'm correct. I don't care. It doesn't matter how long it is
[2068.58s -> 2072.01s]  It could be six months
[2072.01s -> 2075.21s]  Hey, you want the absolute best tip for battleship put every single boat
[2075.93s -> 2077.93s]  Right next to each other in the exact same corner
[2087.27s -> 2093.03s]  Your friends will sit all over that top left part of the map and be like I have no fucking idea where this dude is
[2093.59s -> 2101.56s]  Here we go. All right, where are they? That's right here. Oh you've sunk you did I miss

[2109.18s -> 2110.94s]  Don't get it wrong every time
[2110.94s -> 2114.23s]  How about right here?
[2114.23s -> 2116.23s]  Oh bear just missed
[2119.62s -> 2121.14s]  You're never gonna find it
[2121.14s -> 2128.89s]  Okay, what about what if he's doing the same thing?
[2129.45s -> 2131.34s]  Did I get it?
[2131.34s -> 2132.54s]  Is that a hit?
[2132.54s -> 2137.72s]  No
[2137.72s -> 2142.52s]  Either this strategy or all four corners is the best strategy because people just don't think you're ever gonna do that
[2143.16s -> 2151.42s]  Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? What was that?
[2152.06s -> 2154.14s]  What is this?
[2154.14s -> 2158.98s]  How does he have a four shot?
[2158.98s -> 2160.98s]  Um, excuse me. That's not fair
[2163.16s -> 2166.44s]  And where's mine that shoots four times?
[2168.31s -> 2172.54s]  That's fucking ridiculous
[2173.11s -> 2180.42s]  Why did he get that?
[2180.42s -> 2182.42s]  That's absolutely unfair
[2183.69s -> 2185.69s]  That was a hit. Okay, that's a hit. I know where he is
[2186.49s -> 2190.58s]  Yeah, good luck finding the rest of them
[2190.82s -> 2192.98s]  Right now he's oh right. He can do basic math
[2196.14s -> 2200.78s]  Found yeah, but that's so unfair. You found me because you had the four shooter. That's unbelievable
[2201.58s -> 2203.26s]  He's doing the same thing
[2203.26s -> 2208.95s]  This would have taken him at least four or five more turns
[2209.51s -> 2216.10s]  All right, that's one destroyer. I sunk the destroyer
[2219.62s -> 2221.62s]  All right, so i'm technically in the lead
[2224.78s -> 2230.78s]  I hope he's doing the exact same strat. Ah damn it
[2234.31s -> 2236.31s]  Pre-recorded what what are you talking about?
[2242.60s -> 2245.73s]  Um, i'm gonna say right here. Oh shit
[2249.88s -> 2253.44s]  Is it gonna be close?
[2253.44s -> 2255.84s]  No, but the computer has a bunch of algorithms inside of its head
[2256.56s -> 2258.48s]  It can do that math
[2258.48s -> 2261.12s]  A human does not a human has no idea what's going on
[2261.68s -> 2266.68s]  And then by the time they figure it out
[2267.09s -> 2272.53s]  They look up at you from across the table. They're like dude. No, you did not do that
[2273.25s -> 2275.25s]  No, you didn't
[2275.33s -> 2277.33s]  And I said like
[2277.89s -> 2279.65s]  You didn't know I did
[2279.65s -> 2281.65s]  Dude, no, you didn't
[2282.45s -> 2292.50s]  This computer knows where these are because it's gotta it's literally doing a math problem right now to know what these are
[2298.31s -> 2300.31s]  Music's a banger. Yes, it's pretty good
[2302.98s -> 2304.98s]  Okay, but he technically doesn't know where the other one is
[2313.06s -> 2314.47s]  Right here
[2314.47s -> 2318.04s]  Nope, he does. No, but he can't he doesn't know
[2319.27s -> 2322.92s]  He's still gonna take him. Uh
[2322.92s -> 2324.20s]  It's over. I lose
[2324.20s -> 2326.95s]  but wait, no, no, that was the the
[2331.68s -> 2335.28s]  Can we stop talking about how bad I am at battleship and start talking about how?
[2336.14s -> 2338.80s]  Unbelievable it is that you got to shoot four times in one turn
[2339.76s -> 2350.74s]  Um, I come we're not talking about that and change your weapon
[2354.69s -> 2355.65s]  how

[2379.94s -> 2388.87s]  I missed all of them. But whatever it doesn't matter because you know where to come. You know who to talk to
[2390.42s -> 2395.54s]  When all the top streamers are going back and forth in a huge drama on battleship
[2404.68s -> 2411.46s]  You missed all it doesn't whatever who cares next he lost in 20 turns
[2412.10s -> 2414.42s]  Yeah, but doesn't matter
[2414.42s -> 2416.88s]  Oh, I pressed. It's number 10
[2416.88s -> 2423.52s]  Sorry, I pressed it before you can see it. 10 is robocop 4. We're gonna skip robocop 1 2 and 3

[3303.76s -> 3306.24s]  See you have to hold it for like a full second or two
[3306.96s -> 3312.59s]  Is it fall damage?
[3312.59s -> 3316.78s]  All right, there is
[3316.78s -> 3321.34s]  Dude, fuck this. Fuck mo ya jin. How dare you say something like that?

[3445.49s -> 3451.09s]  Every fucking time I play it. It just makes me fucking angrier every single time
[3453.82s -> 3458.05s]  Um, how do I can't move it?
[3458.05s -> 3462.45s]  Oh, okay

[4037.18s -> 4044.12s]  It really doesn't
[4044.12s -> 4046.12s]  Like if I made a game right now
[4046.84s -> 4049.02s]  That was called contra six
[4049.10s -> 4053.90s]  And I sold it on steam and like rambo was the main character like how quickly would that get removed from steam
[4055.02s -> 4057.02s]  Why am I fighting a tractor?
[4059.18s -> 4060.22s]  What?
[4060.22s -> 4062.46s]  Why doesn't have a mind?
[4070.22s -> 4073.59s]  Forklift, yeah, but there's nobody in it

[4117.06s -> 4119.06s]  regular nintendo slow down
[4123.03s -> 4125.11s]  I gotta get more. Okay. There we go. That's better
[4125.75s -> 4138.86s]  Can I land on that? Can I step on it?
[4139.58s -> 4144.78s]  Go on I want to see what contra five is like. Let's see if it's any different
[4145.34s -> 4148.20s]  There is no five. There's one two three six seven eight
[4149.43s -> 4151.19s]  Oh, let's do contra three
[4151.19s -> 4158.89s]  This is the best contra so let's see this one takes place in neo city 2100 neo city's been around for a long time
[4158.89s -> 4160.49s]  That was 1992
[4160.49s -> 4162.49s]  It was the first neo city wait
[4162.89s -> 4166.57s]  Hey, it's me fox. Is that you burns? Wait the hell
[4167.61s -> 4169.43s]  Yeah
[4169.43s -> 4171.43s]  The head of intelligence
[4171.51s -> 4173.51s]  Is in serious trouble
[4174.23s -> 4177.99s]  We need your help. Wait, this is like 200 years in the future
[4178.55s -> 4179.75s]  Well, what?
[4179.75s -> 4182.71s]  Okay, i'll be in the old warehouse at the edge of the harbor
[4184.34s -> 4187.38s]  They must always be a fox and it must always be a burns
[4188.49s -> 4190.49s]  fox
[4190.49s -> 4196.06s]  No, we must
[4196.06s -> 4201.75s]  That's just my face
[4208.52s -> 4213.40s]  Who am I iron it's the same exact game with just different people
[4214.50s -> 4216.50s]  It's the same game. There's no difference at all
[4216.82s -> 4222.34s]  Okay, I want to look at all the contras. I want to see all the copyright characters. They put in
[4223.22s -> 4226.66s]  Dude, don't be surprised if like fucking mario is on one of these
[4229.58s -> 4231.58s]  I really wouldn't be surprised
[4231.58s -> 4234.06s]  I don't know if like ross from friends was on here, too
[4235.51s -> 4237.51s]  Cookie monster might even be on here
[4237.75s -> 4250.84s]  It could be anybody
[4250.84s -> 4254.20s]  Okay, i've already I don't care. I just want to know who the other characters are. I want to see the cutscene
[4254.20s -> 4261.72s]  Let's go to contra one. We've seen three and we've seen six. Let's see what contra one is
[4263.64s -> 4265.85s]  uh
[4265.85s -> 4268.98s]  Wait, what?
[4268.98s -> 4272.26s]  So inside of the contra one folder was like contra two through eight
[4274.04s -> 4281.03s]  This is just how a ton of folders on my desktop are right now. It's just poor folder management. Uh,
[4281.98s -> 4283.98s]  Okay, we're gonna do contra two
[4288.49s -> 4292.89s]  Contra one folder into subdirectory contra two and now this is just contra
[4294.52s -> 4296.20s]  a 100 rip
[4296.20s -> 4300.68s]  Uh completely I would say absolutely fucking against the law completely illegal. This is contra one
[4301.85s -> 4305.62s]  Um, okay, whatever
[4305.62s -> 4312.04s]  I I guess that's what this is contra one. No, it's not wait. Why do I have a spreader automatically?
[4314.50s -> 4316.98s]  This is like level three in contra one
[4317.86s -> 4319.86s]  But I have upgraded weapons
[4327.42s -> 4328.62s]  That is
[4328.62s -> 4329.82s]  Oh, okay
[4329.82s -> 4338.20s]  And they made it really simple. They gave you the spreader
[4338.84s -> 4344.30s]  Why would you do this?
[4344.30s -> 4347.96s]  It's just different scenes from contra one
[4349.40s -> 4354.44s]  So am I correct when I think that when they say contra two they mean level two in contra one
[4355.70s -> 4357.70s]  We need to investigate a little further here
[4358.66s -> 4374.76s]  This is gonna take some full investigation. He's so smart. Hey, thanks, man
[4378.82s -> 4381.06s]  You know what that boss used to scare the shit out of me in contra
[4382.44s -> 4386.28s]  It was the boss in I believe it was this exact same kind of style
[4387.58s -> 4389.26s]  Super contra, right?
[4389.26s -> 4391.26s]  Like that weird skeleton guy
[4392.14s -> 4396.78s]  That hangs around the room when he jumps on he hangs from the ceiling and shit and then his face pops out of the middle
[4399.06s -> 4403.86s]  And super contra was terrifying. It made every time you fought a boss. It played this horrible scary music
[4408.20s -> 4410.20s]  It was like
[4412.76s -> 4414.76s]  It was like fuck the boss is kind of scary
[4421.06s -> 4432.17s]  Kill it off. I forgot how fun these games were
[4432.89s -> 4436.09s]  You know the sad part about this
[4436.17s -> 4440.01s]  I'm gonna say something right now and you guys can tell me. Oh, no. No. Yeah, that's right, dude. That happened already
[4440.97s -> 4442.97s]  um, is it too bad that
[4443.53s -> 4448.65s]  I would love a new contra but the one definitely came out that was an ipad pay to win game probably right?
[4449.13s -> 4455.69s]  I'm sure they redid contra for ios and it's probably just complete just dog shit pay to win like weird shitty game or something, right?
[4456.65s -> 4466.10s]  That's so sad, I feel like that would be the thing. All right stage three waterfall. I have 26 lives
[4469.53s -> 4472.38s]  26 lives
[4472.38s -> 4474.38s]  was this in
[4474.70s -> 4479.18s]  I don't remember any of this
[4479.18s -> 4481.18s]  I don't I don't remember this being the game
[4481.98s -> 4484.41s]  Did I ever never get this far as a kid?
[4486.26s -> 4497.27s]  All right, I want to investigate contra one. Okay, so that was contra two. Here's contra three
[4499.58s -> 4501.58s]  It's definitely just the level select
[4503.74s -> 4507.74s]  Yeah, it's the level select. Yeah, of course it is. Oh my fucking god. So what's the other ones then?
[4508.22s -> 4513.61s]  So if that's that so what is contra 30p?
[4515.60s -> 4517.60s]  Shotgun what's shotgun?
[4520.62s -> 4533.42s]  This is just letting you start with the shotgun. That's so dumb
[4534.54s -> 4537.50s]  Okay
[4537.50s -> 4542.22s]  It's just just a game shark. Okay. No, no, no, I don't want to do contra. No stop doing contras
[4544.13s -> 4546.60s]  12 in one
[4546.60s -> 4548.04s]  so bogus
[4548.04s -> 4550.04s]  Click the link. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this link?
[4550.84s -> 4562.52s]  I'm gonna click the link. Okay, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. Not bad. It's not bad. It's pretty good
[4568.57s -> 4573.42s]  Uh, by the way, that is eight oh five eight. Oh six see I can read that today
[4581.61s -> 4599.69s]  Uh, how come it's not showing up there it is. All right, let's go. I want to see what contra two is
[4609.24s -> 4611.16s]  This is a debug menu
[4611.16s -> 4622.15s]  All right contra 30s contra four a this is not what that's not contra super
[4622.15s -> 4633.50s]  What arena four play is this contra it is
[4634.14s -> 4642.52s]  So this is just contra two
[4642.84s -> 4647.16s]  The contra three is not contra three. It's a made-up contra three
[4647.96s -> 4652.79s]  So what would contra six or seven be? Um, I've no I don't know what's going on
[4653.59s -> 4664.71s]  Not bad
[4664.71s -> 4672.22s]  But all right. I I don't I need to see so if that's contra two con we've seen contra six
[4672.87s -> 4687.18s]  What is contra seven super contra seven? I hope fox I hope burns is in trouble
[4690.63s -> 4692.63s]  Oh, this is uh, definitely a made-up one
[4694.55s -> 4698.30s]  uh
[4698.30s -> 4702.14s]  You can tell because how badly this one runs and I can't even pick this item up
[4702.70s -> 4706.60s]  It's just a rom hack of the first one
[4709.27s -> 4711.59s]  All the enemy spawning is just so wrong and off
[4715.98s -> 4717.74s]  two room
[4717.74s -> 4719.34s]  Two room sail
[4719.34s -> 4721.34s]  Look at this enemy spawning

[5458.10s -> 5460.10s]  So I have to destroy the nukes here
[5461.18s -> 5464.14s]  If you don't get enough momentum, by the way, you're not going to make these jumps. So I need to

[5771.85s -> 5774.06s]  Okay
[5774.06s -> 5778.94s]  They must have just seen the cyborg and just said you know what I don't just put it as robocop three
[5779.50s -> 5788.20s]  This is good
[5788.20s -> 5791.37s]  It actually is pretty fun
[5791.37s -> 5798.02s]  Shatter hand is an actually good game
[5801.11s -> 5805.18s]  Kind of feels that way
[5805.18s -> 5806.71s]  All right
[5806.71s -> 5809.02s]  Play ace combat
[5809.02s -> 5811.02s]  Will you stop with the ace combat?

[5887.19s -> 5897.03s]  shockwave shockwave by american game cartridges
[5898.92s -> 5904.36s]  I would probably put at least a hundred dollars on the fact that this was not made by an american game cartridge company
[5904.44s -> 5911.64s]  I think that would be a safe bet
[5911.64s -> 5915.13s]  But you know

[6543.75s -> 6546.07s]  The absolute just double cross
[6549.30s -> 6557.48s]  I want to play this another one one more time. I don't get max anymore. He's gone
[6557.88s -> 6562.71s]  Oh
[6562.71s -> 6566.71s]  Jesus christ, that's impossible. It's too hard. It's a fun one, but that's
[6567.51s -> 6577.48s]  You move so slow. All right. What's next 415 go backwards. It'll be faster
[6579.00s -> 6581.74s]  four one five is
[6583.05s -> 6589.21s]  Holy shit, dude. This one is not just warfare. Not just a great war not just constant war the
[6590.07s -> 6595.34s]  utmost warfare there's no other warfare that will be more
[6595.90s -> 6599.82s]  Uh, that'll be higher than this that'll be more dangerous and and this is the size this is the top
[6599.82s -> 6603.48s]  This is high as you can go in war
[6603.48s -> 6607.72s]  And they've already got planets and shit. So we're talking planetary level of destruction
[6617.48s -> 6619.45s]  I don't know what i'm hitting
[6619.45s -> 6625.90s]  There's so many particles on the screen. I don't know which one is an enemy which is part of the background
[6626.94s -> 6635.93s]  Okay, I think I understand
[6635.93s -> 6640.63s]  Remember the asterisk
[6640.63s -> 6644.09s]  Oh double triple spreader
[6655.70s -> 6659.94s]  And you have so much screen real estate that you're only going to use the middle part of the screen and down
[6660.90s -> 6665.54s]  You really had to have that big planet the big marble in the background had to take up the entire third of the screen
[6666.58s -> 6669.86s]  Because they weren't spawning in the middle. This would be a lot easier and way more fun
[6670.02s -> 6672.98s]  And I don't know what's coming at us. Something is coming towards us
[6673.70s -> 6683.64s]  I feel like i'm watching
[6683.64s -> 6686.68s]  When somebody uploads an entire television show to youtube
[6687.88s -> 6692.04s]  And they put it in a square in the middle of the screen and they surround it with a bunch of other bullshit
[6693.16s -> 6696.82s]  It's like dude, that's like you think it's gonna help
[6711.45s -> 6715.13s]  Oh, there's no never be a war that will be more than this
[6715.93s -> 6729.66s]  I've had enough. What's next?
[6729.72s -> 6734.78s]  357
[6734.78s -> 6738.71s]  Boot cat. I got a good feeling about boot cat boot cat
[6740.20s -> 6743.48s]  Oh, it's just that's a cat inside of a boot. This couldn't get any more fun
[6745.78s -> 6748.54s]  scene one england
[6748.54s -> 6750.54s]  Uh, that's not where england is

[6785.66s -> 6787.66s]  You have to start it just stands still to shoot
[6791.58s -> 6795.03s]  Uh, it's like four seconds left. What?
[6795.83s -> 6799.88s]  Why is the timer counting up instead of down? That's kind of weird, right?
[6800.92s -> 6802.92s]  Why is it a 14 seconds?
[6808.42s -> 6812.47s]  Uh, this is a real game. What do they make this up?
[6817.72s -> 6822.20s]  Is that the time of day? Is that gonna reset at zero? Let's see. Yeah, that's the time of day
[6822.52s -> 6824.52s]  That's what time it is right now
[6824.60s -> 6829.96s]  They decided to add a full cycling block
[6834.73s -> 6835.77s]  Why?
[6835.77s -> 6843.82s]  Honey, I can't shoot
[6843.98s -> 6847.02s]  There's a giant shark under there and i'm can barely concern
[6847.66s -> 6849.66s]  Oh my eyes
[6850.58s -> 6852.02s]  Why?

[6860.04s -> 6862.04s]  Oh my god, the sun just exploded
[6862.68s -> 6872.46s]  This is a long level one, by the way, it just doesn't stop
[6873.26s -> 6877.91s]  We could have done mario
[6877.99s -> 6879.90s]  one one
[6879.90s -> 6882.20s]  10 times by now
[6882.20s -> 6884.20s]  It never ends dragon

[6941.18s -> 6944.94s]  You can't just change the thickness of the pen halfway through your ms paint
[6945.58s -> 6947.58s]  Drawing you can't do that
[6947.58s -> 6949.58s]  But what happened to the consistency?

[7078.06s -> 7088.90s]  All right, don't blow it. Have we figured out what the timer is actually for?
[7090.62s -> 7094.14s]  Or is it just there for some reason what's the 73 in the top?
[7095.34s -> 7096.30s]  Wait

[7107.90s -> 7110.87s]  Slow down
[7110.87s -> 7115.91s]  They look at the mat movement pattern. They move with the screen faster when you hit right

[7150.26s -> 7152.26s]  Oh my god, this is so this is impossible
[7152.74s -> 7155.37s]  You have no idea how hard this is
[7155.37s -> 7158.33s]  These things just started spawning from the right side of the screen and they're hitting me over and over again
[7158.33s -> 7163.91s]  I'm gonna die. I can't look at the screen. I'm doing this my eyes closed kind of i'm opening them every five. Okay, we're good

[7826.81s -> 7827.45s]  Here's all right
[7827.45s -> 7832.57s]  There's a few just a few you know ground rules that are played that are put in place when you play video against your friends, right?
[7833.29s -> 7836.49s]  Anybody ever played a sports game like a baseball with their friends?
[7837.13s -> 7838.65s]  one-on-one
[7838.65s -> 7843.77s]  And you have to make the rule you are only allowed to throw strikes because throwing balls
[7844.33s -> 7848.49s]  Was impossible to read and you would miss every time if they threw it way far away
[7851.10s -> 7853.90s]  No leg sweeps in mortal combat or you automatically lose
[7859.13s -> 7862.25s]  Like if you if you do a leg sweep in mortal combat I win the match
[7863.05s -> 7866.49s]  If you throw a ball in like some of those old nintendo super nintendo games
[7867.05s -> 7871.69s]  That were baseball you automatically lose like because you they're unhittable and you can't even tell that they're coming in as ball

[7914.41s -> 7916.97s]  This one's actually pretty fun
[7916.97s -> 7918.97s]  This is probably just the actual game
[7920.42s -> 7921.59s]  but
[7921.59s -> 7922.71s]  uh
[7922.71s -> 7925.98s]  Did they do the movie backwards?
[7925.98s -> 7942.07s]  Doesn't the tournament happen like in the end of the movie the popular one to not seem like a mortal combat scrub
[7945.99s -> 7947.91s]  um, i'm sorry, but
[7947.91s -> 7951.11s]  The leg sweep in mortal combat like one two and three
[7952.30s -> 7963.03s]  Swing the hammer. All right, if anybody trains like that, that's what wouldn't happen
[7963.51s -> 7967.72s]  I know you like to watch that in movies and tv shows all the extreme training regiment
[7967.72s -> 7971.08s]  Well, you have to like dodge like all these things. Look at all. It's a knife. It's gonna kill you

[7974.22s -> 7975.98s]  dodge the pendulum
[7975.98s -> 7980.06s]  I'm gonna like you're gonna go through like the fucking football training thing and smash into stuff

[8043.42s -> 8044.86s]  maybe longer
[8044.86s -> 8056.52s]  This person throwing I like the bonus games are more fun than the actual game. I just want to play those

[9102.66s -> 9113.88s]  pretty good we're making a ouija board horsey and
[9115.10s -> 9116.30s]  one of those
[9116.30s -> 9119.58s]  Push machines that has the balls in it that pretends to be a lawnmower and it goes
[9120.06s -> 9137.91s]  There's a little thing in the middle pops the balls up. I love those. It's like my favorite toy. Okay, uh,

[9165.80s -> 9169.48s]  It's mary had a little lamb mary had a little lamb and the sheep's wool was what?
[9172.42s -> 9174.10s]  It's a real lawnmower
[9174.10s -> 9185.18s]  His fur was soft as snow
[9186.36s -> 9191.26s]  That's not it whose fur was soft as snow. You got it wrong, too
[9192.14s -> 9197.38s]  That's incorrect
[9199.22s -> 9202.90s]  Little lamb it's probably funny when people sing nursery rhymes like that
[9203.86s -> 9205.06s]  and
[9205.06s -> 9208.26s]  Look when you sing mary had a little lamb or twinkle twinkle little star
[9208.26s -> 9213.78s]  It's just so simple and basic in the syllables and the way that you say it is broken up so deliberately like
[9214.40s -> 9219.46s]  Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb
[9220.17s -> 9225.59s]  But when you have a singer that gets a hold of those it's no longer simple anymore. It's like
[9226.23s -> 9228.63s]  mary had a little lamb
[9229.19s -> 9234.23s]  Little lamb little lamb. It's like you just fucking sing the song normally for god's sake
[9235.58s -> 9242.38s]  Mary had a little lamb whose snow was half as large
[9251.32s -> 9256.10s]  I'm getting old

[9324.74s -> 9330.34s]  They would do something like this right like the pig dancing with like retro graphics and stuff. I think that did happen didn't it
[9339.59s -> 9343.51s]  What is the song the song at the end of that song? It's like try

[9653.93s -> 9656.01s]  Just because one person says it doesn't mean it's gonna happen
[9656.81s -> 9660.02s]  It needs to be at least a 50 to 60 percent
[9660.58s -> 9670.17s]  Agreeance with everybody in chat here. You got to get at least 10 people on board
[9671.19s -> 9674.63s]  And then those 10 people have to get 20 people on board and those 20 people have to get 100 people on board
[9674.71s -> 9676.07s]  Those 100 people
[9676.07s -> 9678.47s]  Have to get another 500 people on board
[9679.11s -> 9680.87s]  and that's how you get
[9680.87s -> 9687.67s]  10 percent of people in this chat that liked the catboy shit to like 70 percent because now I have to dress up this month
[9695.75s -> 9702.09s]  I'm gonna beat this game. I'm actually gonna get to the end

[9777.35s -> 9791.48s]  Okay, what's how you play? It's kind of freaking me out. I have people just locked up in like a cage up there
[9791.48s -> 9794.10s]  And we make them do this shit
[9794.10s -> 9798.70s]  um

[9867.22s -> 9875.30s]  Let's do it like the star wars movies. They take capcom off the top of that. By the way, they just deleted it
[9875.30s -> 9890.06s]  They just put a black over it. That says probably capcom presents. That was a capcom font chip and dale rescue rangers
[9893.51s -> 9900.87s]  Yeah, now it's legal. Yeah, they they removed who made it on the splash screen. Therefore. It's now completely legal to just sell it

[9936.58s -> 9938.58s]  Chip and dale get on the case
[9940.70s -> 9945.02s]  He just broke in here and went that way. You must get him and get our gold back

[9959.90s -> 9961.58s]  I wish I could read this
[9961.58s -> 9967.02s]  I thought she thought he's gonna jump right on her head
[9973.34s -> 9976.30s]  All right, let's go. We have to introduce every single character that's in the show
[9978.17s -> 9980.17s]  Like get jimmy cricket out of here
[9981.06s -> 9983.88s]  There he is. There's dale
[9983.88s -> 9989.00s]  So dale is uh, if I remember I haven't seen the show or seen them talk in probably 10 years or so
[9989.56s -> 9991.56s]  Dale is like a high-pitched goofy, right?
[9994.76s -> 9999.75s]  It's goofy but higher pitched. Okay, I can read that one
[10004.26s -> 10006.26s]  It's like wow. I
[10006.34s -> 10008.68s]  Hold on. I'll try to get it
[10008.68s -> 10015.64s]  I think it's like goofy. It's like goofy, but it's high pitched. It's like this. It's kind of like goofy, but kind of like this
[10016.52s -> 10019.32s]  It's like that
[10019.32s -> 10021.32s]  Oh, I don't know about this dale chip
[10021.96s -> 10029.45s]  Let me let me think but it's really it's like the alphan and chipmunks. They pitch it up, right?
[10029.61s -> 10039.67s]  Hold on see if I can get it. I do this. Oh, it's me
[10040.55s -> 10044.06s]  Shit, we gotta get down there and save that gold if we don't get it
[10044.06s -> 10052.49s]  We're gonna be in bad trouble. Is that close goku?
[10053.66s -> 10054.87s]  No
[10054.87s -> 10066.73s]  Now, let me see what it actually sounds like uh chip and dale. Let me hold on
[10078.39s -> 10088.23s]  All right. Okay chip and dale. There's a gadget scene. I just want to hear the voice for a second. I hear it

[10118.57s -> 10125.66s]  I'll admit they do seem to have he doesn't talk
[10133.46s -> 10137.16s]  To contribute some
[10137.80s -> 10145.06s]  Dale doesn't talk. I met I fucked the whole thing up dale doesn't talk. This is chip
[10147.54s -> 10168.65s]  I told you it was pitched up like crazy. Dale doesn't talk at all chip and dale rescue rangers. Hold on. I was close
[10177.67s -> 10186.20s]  Yeah, it was close. It was not high pitched enough
[10188.58s -> 10194.20s]  All right, let me get back to play this game
[10195.64s -> 10207.56s]  Please i'm still on the chair what I mean i'm still on the chair a bit. What are you talking about? Oh a burger
[10220.58s -> 10225.06s]  Why these blocks don't exist I tried to jump game is not even fucking fun game is fucking stupid

[10296.34s -> 10300.10s]  Walt disney company produced by capcom forgot to scratch that one out
[10309.40s -> 10311.40s]  This actually just is the chip and dale game, isn't it?
[10321.99s -> 10334.89s]  Yeah, this is just this is just the game. I've played it before chip and dale 3

[10421.11s -> 10423.91s]  Firing missiles
[10423.91s -> 10427.11s]  It was extremely bad
[10427.11s -> 10433.77s]  It was the what hold on. How's this? Is this different? Is this better? How's this one?

[10515.06s -> 10525.35s]  Let me in out of the front door of the base
[10528.62s -> 10535.34s]  Dale relax. This is like the big smile on your face. This is this is fucked up. Uh,

[10555.00s -> 10557.40s]  So what game is this actually that they put chip and dale on?
[10562.84s -> 10565.43s]  Of all the things
[10565.43s -> 10567.35s]  Don't waste bullets
[10567.35s -> 10570.07s]  I'll be all right. I mean, this is so many things on the screen
[10570.63s -> 10582.79s]  The chip and dale rescue rangers. I want to get to the boss. This is just chip and dale 3 dude

[10592.95s -> 10602.30s]  This is a hack of heavy barrel

[10635.05s -> 10638.33s]  It's for you to scream
[10638.33s -> 10643.53s]  I do not think whoever made this console was concerned about me streaming this console
[10644.33s -> 10652.73s]  If they were
[10652.73s -> 10654.81s]  Uh, I think they would be a little more careful
[10656.20s -> 10658.20s]  Of all the uh
[10658.20s -> 10668.09s]  Copywritten content that is in it. I'm enjoying chip and dale 3 though. It's actually kind of fun

[10771.90s -> 10775.50s]  Hot blood wrestle hot blood story. I think is what we start with first
[10775.82s -> 10789.21s]  It's just river city ransom, which is an incredible game for the ns. Is it though?
[10793.10s -> 10794.94s]  It is it's just river city ransom
[10794.94s -> 10802.25s]  This game used to scare the shit out of me because these ever when they start chasing you with weapons
[10802.81s -> 10805.69s]  It's terrifying
[10805.69s -> 10807.69s]  I love this game. Uh, best part of the game
[10808.01s -> 10809.69s]  Is when you eat the plates

[10818.79s -> 10820.63s]  I played this on stream, didn't I?
[10820.63s -> 10825.94s]  Have I never played river city ransom on stream?
[10830.17s -> 10834.33s]  Yeah, you go and you buy food and stuff. It's awesome because you eat the whole plate
[10834.41s -> 10836.41s]  It doesn't matter what it is. It could be a coffee. It could be
[10836.57s -> 10838.97s]  A sushi or like a hamburger doesn't matter
[10839.53s -> 10841.21s]  You eat the entire plate

[11138.09s -> 11140.09s]  Two omega pods
[11140.09s -> 11143.98s]  This is made by the guilty gear devs. That's interesting
[11144.62s -> 11150.33s]  All right, let's get a random one
[11150.33s -> 11152.41s]  I'm having fun. I love this. This is like a bunch of fun
[11154.78s -> 11158.22s]  It's just a shitty game loot box. You just open up a random number
[11160.63s -> 11162.63s]  Some of them are actually real games
[11164.98s -> 11168.02s]  Hexapoo man. No hexapoo new
[11171.53s -> 11174.98s]  All right, it's poo new

[11215.99s -> 11219.51s]  And one level one complete presents to start hexapod
[11220.15s -> 11223.40s]  level two

[11249.14s -> 11255.85s]  This is bug spray
[11255.85s -> 11261.34s]  All right, one more level and i'm done last one
[11273.10s -> 11274.30s]  I can't
[11274.30s -> 11279.27s]  I can't i'm gonna say I hit the escape right off. It's not escape. It's reset actually
[11281.82s -> 11282.78s]  It's like
[11282.78s -> 11285.02s]  Yeah, every this hurts
[11285.02s -> 11289.98s]  You ever play a game or something and it's just you just need to move your body around because blah you just hate
[11290.14s -> 11291.42s]  I can't stop
[11291.42s -> 11300.92s]  All right. How about um, let's pick a good one
[11301.64s -> 11306.95s]  Mortal Kombat 4
[11309.99s -> 11312.36s]  Superman
[11322.65s -> 11324.36s]  Okay
[11324.36s -> 11329.72s]  There's how many I don't even know how many characters is this a match three game or is this the character selector?
[11330.92s -> 11333.40s]  I thought it was a match three game. Okay, this is Sonya
[11338.12s -> 11340.95s]  What the fuck?
[11340.95s -> 11342.95s]  Sonya versus nightwolf
[11350.12s -> 11353.24s]  It actually is mortal kombat but not
[11353.96s -> 11355.00s]  at all
[11355.00s -> 11361.85s]  I'm getting destroyed
[11361.85s -> 11364.25s]  Okay. So hold on if this is Sonya, who's the other Sonya?
[11364.89s -> 11373.78s]  Because there's like five Sonya's on that character select pick the green sub zero
[11374.26s -> 11378.04s]  You know what? The best part about this is this blood
[11379.08s -> 11383.32s]  They tried to keep it as authentic as possible with member original blood in mortal kombat
[11385.06s -> 11390.82s]  All the parents all the legislation that was like this is bad. There's blood in this video games people. That's just it's disgusting. It's horrible
[11391.62s -> 11402.62s]  They kept that
[11402.62s -> 11410.42s]  I lost. All right. Hold on reset. I i'm going to pick another character
[11410.74s -> 11420.81s]  I want to pick green sub zero and see what it is. Where is
[11421.93s -> 11426.95s]  What even is this? This is uh cano
[11428.23s -> 11430.23s]  This is sub zero, right?
[11430.31s -> 11437.56s]  Is this striker?
[11437.56s -> 11442.44s]  It's kratos
[11442.44s -> 11444.60s]  Um, where's that's sub zero, right?
[11448.78s -> 11451.18s]  Is it don't johnny cage? No, johnny case has sunglasses
[11451.82s -> 11462.55s]  We're gonna be red sub zero
[11462.55s -> 11464.55s]  Liu kang versus nightwolf
[11469.53s -> 11470.89s]  No, it wasn't
[11470.89s -> 11473.59s]  I gotta see if I can do the kick
[11473.59s -> 11476.79s]  What's the button combination to do the actual kick move?
[11487.91s -> 11493.08s]  Just keep him in the corner. Wait, can I do the sweep?
[11493.72s -> 11498.14s]  This game doesn't wait. It doesn't have a sweep
[11506.97s -> 11512.09s]  Is there wait, we need to see if there's a finisher if there's fatalities in this i'm gonna laugh my ass off
[11512.65s -> 11514.01s]  Up down kick
[11514.01s -> 11528.02s]  Fuck he's supposed to be in the face. All right. I want to try to get fatality dude
[11529.66s -> 11531.46s]  Wait
[11531.46s -> 11533.46s]  Is that shao khan?
[11534.18s -> 11536.79s]  That's not nightwolf
[11536.79s -> 11542.62s]  That hasn't been nightwolf this whole time
[11549.53s -> 11560.28s]  I was wondering something fell off about him. That's a lot of blood
[11564.22s -> 11569.72s]  Did I won?
[11569.72s -> 11576.75s]  Just had to make sure he was extra dead fatality
[11577.59s -> 11597.94s]  All right. This is striker red striker is who it's just striker. Okay. Oh wait, is that the bicycle kick?
[11600.74s -> 11604.82s]  Forward punch forward forward kick forward forward kick back forward kick back back kick back back kick
[11609.75s -> 11612.79s]  Back back kick back back forward kick back back forward kick back back forward kick
[11613.51s -> 11617.10s]  Back back forward kick
[11617.10s -> 11618.54s]  Just kill me. Whatever
[11618.54s -> 11638.50s]  Another 15 subs from scrumpleton scrumpleton. Thanks for the 15th sub. It's a fucking lot of stuff
[11639.14s -> 11643.14s]  A lot of subs right now. All right. Uh, I don't know what this is, but i'm gonna pick it
[11643.78s -> 11653.18s]  It's just shang seng. All right. No, it's not
[11653.82s -> 11661.94s]  Wait, no, it's not
[11661.94s -> 11683.48s]  I'm gonna get perfect. I'm literally about to get perfected. I can't even attack him. Wait. Wait, am I striker? What's happening?
[11683.48s -> 11685.48s]  I just was pressing buttons strikers
[11687.93s -> 11695.43s]  Who am I? I'm not even playing the game. I'm not playing I was not playing I was not playing the game
[11697.03s -> 11703.82s]  They were big bits too. Oh, there was a hundred bucks. Holy shit. Okay, uh valemi. Thanks for the hundred dollars
[11705.03s -> 11707.03s]  Although I don't read bits anymore
[11707.51s -> 11711.58s]  I do not read bit messages anymore. We talked about how I
[11712.22s -> 11715.22s]  wanted to move away from that and
[11716.01s -> 11718.23s]  Uh, that's kind of the way it is
[11718.23s -> 11720.87s]  So for those of you that don't know if you might not have been here for a while
[11720.87s -> 11726.81s]  I do I no longer read bits because it got to a point where I took bits away from the end of the stream
[11726.89s -> 11732.70s]  I stopped reading them, but I still was reading like a hundred dollar bits and I find that to be a precedent
[11732.70s -> 11737.30s]  I do not want to set people to uh, try to
[11738.26s -> 11745.02s]  Essentially, I don't want to have it be a thing where people give me money and I i'm gonna like read it out loud
[11745.96s -> 11747.96s]  And I don't want to set that precedence for people
[11748.44s -> 11752.20s]  To like feel like they have to pay me money like an insane amount of money
[11752.60s -> 11755.22s]  To try to get me to like read something
[11755.86s -> 11759.10s]  I don't want that precedence to be set at all
[11759.10s -> 11762.46s]  So I stopped reading bits of the uh, it used to be 250
[11763.29s -> 11767.61s]  And if somebody wants to me to read something, I don't want to be like I have to give this guy a hundred fucking dollars
[11767.61s -> 11777.48s]  So he will not read it. So that's something I don't want to have happen. That's why I kind of stopped reading bits completely
[11781.43s -> 11783.43s]  Please god read this
[11787.94s -> 11790.38s]  You're a wholesome fucker
[11790.38s -> 11796.12s]  No, I just don't want people to have to drop that kind of money to have me read something
[11796.12s -> 11802.04s]  You know, I'd rather just pick it out of chat and I still if somebody gives community subs
[11802.04s -> 11807.54s]  I still read them. I still just read the fact that they were given but there's no message attached to the community subs or anything
[11807.54s -> 11813.82s]  It's just sort of um, and people get the subs. It's not just me receiving like a hundred dollars in bits
[11815.85s -> 11817.85s]  So that's why the kind of the idea
[11818.01s -> 11821.77s]  I just don't ever want it to get to a point where people need to spend an insane amount of money to
[11821.93s -> 11838.04s]  And i'll read it he doesn't know how to read no, but I I do know how to read bird week study the game
[11842.07s -> 11858.33s]  All right. I need to study the game was there to study. How is this just not playing the game?
[11865.75s -> 11868.95s]  How is this different than just playing the what about how is this studying the game
[11871.48s -> 11882.12s]  You have to eat the butterflies
[11882.12s -> 11884.12s]  Why do I keep running into that bird? I'm so stupid
[11884.60s -> 11891.67s]  Speaking of subs, we got 10 from anonymous and then 10 from shock too. So thanks both you guys. Oh my god. I'm fucking
[11892.31s -> 11894.17s]  Bird week sucks
[11894.17s -> 11897.37s]  Although I wish there was a bird week on that shark week channel discovery
[11898.10s -> 11900.74s]  We get shark week. I don't care about shark week. I would want bird week
[11900.74s -> 11912.70s]  I'm more interested in birds time for mario 10 super mario super brothers kung fu mari
[11919.42s -> 11920.86s]  super mario
[11920.86s -> 11924.44s]  kung fu mario
[11924.60s -> 11927.88s]  When he just jumps up, he's got like a human body
[11928.60s -> 11931.56s]  Like a wait, he has he has a human body, doesn't he?
[11936.31s -> 11939.35s]  That's just this mario 2 mario mario 3
[11942.04s -> 11944.28s]  He's huge. Yeah, he's like six five
[11945.08s -> 11953.93s]  There's a knight
[11953.93s -> 11955.93s]  A lot of random assets in this game
[11956.49s -> 11964.63s]  You know what's bizarre about this though? I really could I really feel like this could be one of those mario games that came out
[11966.55s -> 11971.11s]  25 years ago or just regular nintendo or super nintendo that nobody talks about nobody hears about anymore
[11973.19s -> 11976.39s]  What was that one mario and time like luigi stuck in time or something?
[11980.02s -> 11982.58s]  If there was a mario yahtzee game like this could be real
[11986.50s -> 11988.74s]  Mario is missing. Yeah, that's one right. Yeah, that's one
[11994.87s -> 12000.57s]  A giant tiger
[12000.81s -> 12003.13s]  Just getting mauled by a tiger in mario
[12010.01s -> 12012.17s]  Very hyper realistic tiger. Yeah
[12015.98s -> 12017.98s]  I wish there were mario sounds in this
[12018.98s -> 12024.10s]  they're like
[12037.58s -> 12042.06s]  Losing focus. Yeah, i'm i'm i've my brain has one road
[12044.39s -> 12049.83s]  It's a one lane highway
[12049.83s -> 12054.31s]  It just goes in a straight line and if you if you tell me I need to take a turn off that highway. Nope
[12055.80s -> 12059.56s]  I can't have more lanes. It can't be more than one car on that road. It's just one fucking road
[12060.44s -> 12062.44s]  And it's long and it's huge
[12068.50s -> 12072.50s]  But that car can go 500 miles per hour
[12078.34s -> 12080.34s]  It's a it's a lamborghini on that road
[12080.82s -> 12084.57s]  What mario character is this?
[12084.57s -> 12091.53s]  It's actually not even that it's actually kind of a fun game
[12092.33s -> 12095.85s]  That was it was toad
[12096.17s -> 12097.53s]  Krillin
[12097.53s -> 12100.89s]  Wait, was it who was that? That person was so small
[12101.61s -> 12105.05s]  That person was like three times smaller than me and he's jacked who i've just realized
[12106.44s -> 12108.47s]  oh
[12108.47s -> 12110.47s]  No, I thought it was a boss
[12110.47s -> 12113.51s]  Auto scroller, of course, it'd be an auto scroll in a mario game. Why not?
[12114.39s -> 12123.50s]  All right for all the shit talking. It's not even that bad of a designed video game
[12124.22s -> 12126.04s]  It's not bad
[12126.04s -> 12130.31s]  It's just a little weird
[12130.39s -> 12132.39s]  Oh shit. Okay. I'm good
[12132.47s -> 12142.84s]  It's scrolling very fast. Yeah, it is

[14644.26s -> 14645.94s]  Design work. I know it
[14645.94s -> 14660.97s]  The song is awful for a spider-man. This should be way more upbeat
[14664.12s -> 14674.74s]  This does not feel like spider-man music at all. And when does this end the enemy has full health?
[14676.70s -> 14697.03s]  What enemy am I supposed to be shooting at enemy full health? Well, I want to see spider-man too for oh, sorry

[14769.34s -> 14784.78s]  Stage five dr. Octopus
[14784.78s -> 14787.66s]  I don't think there's anything else. I don't think this one has anything else in it
[14795.83s -> 14799.51s]  Every time he touches you it resets the whole game. Holy shit. This is awful
[14800.23s -> 14804.12s]  I'm gonna after stage 10 if it's still dr. Octopus. I'm leaving

[14985.86s -> 14992.25s]  Absolutely. No idea what's going on. I'm not controlling anything. I'm not shooting that i'm not firing it. It's just doing it on its own
[14995.00s -> 15003.90s]  This is randomly ai generated music. I think this is just a little toy. That's fun to look at for kids or something
[15006.58s -> 15016.25s]  I don't have control of this. I don't have control of this
[15020.47s -> 15022.15s]  I can pause the game
