[1.34s -> 8.97s]  All right, how long does it take to pee? Oh, not that long. I just was moving some stuff around.
[8.97s -> 27.96s]  Okay, hold on. Talking to Transformer. That's fine. Do Sam and Max? No. No, no, no, no, no,
[27.96s -> 32.39s]  because we're only going to do this for like an hour or two and Sam and I don't want to start
[32.39s -> 36.55s]  season three of Sam and Max and only do like, you know, get like halfway through an episode.
[37.43s -> 41.00s]  It's too late for Sam and Max. I'm sorry, guys. I'm going to crush your dreams here.
[41.72s -> 48.06s]  Jerma hates Sam and Max. I played the first two seasons already. Just hold on. We'll do it
[48.06s -> 62.23s]  eventually. Everybody needs to slow down. Well, that's not in the right place. I have to turn
[62.23s -> 74.89s]  this down. Hey! My hair is so fucking long. It looks so stupid. This needs to be moved to here.
[75.69s -> 89.46s]  Don't move. All right, let's get this also on the screen because that is the actual
[89.46s -> 129.83s]  Transformer. A lot of white space, but it's okay. All right, talk to Transformer.
[129.83s -> 145.54s]  Let's wait. We should get a custom prompt. Okay. How about small in this? Okay. Another
[145.54s -> 162.20s]  six flags reviewed now. This is bright as hell in here too. I'm like getting washed out here.
[162.20s -> 181.85s]  That looks better. Prompt. How about you do E3 predictions, now do an E3 review.
[182.41s -> 215.45s]  Okay. How about with my drink? Let me tell you a sad story. All right. How many sake has it been?
[215.45s -> 224.09s]  Let's see. The Japanese can really eat just about anything from rice and noodles to fruit,
[224.09s -> 229.85s]  vegetables, and more. There have long been delicious Japanese options in grocery stores and
[229.85s -> 234.20s]  home kitchens. If you can't find sake in grocery stores, you're probably getting it
[234.20s -> 239.93s]  shipped to Japan from overseas and is being sold in convenience stores or on convenience
[239.93s -> 245.26s]  food trucks. If you happen to live in Japan, if you're a veteran of the nation, then you
[245.26s -> 250.62s]  probably know where the best sake is. Sake lovers don't need to read the Japanese and need
[250.62s -> 255.34s]  only to look closely to see a big difference with what comes in every Japanese grocery store.
[256.58s -> 261.06s]  Japanese convenience store sake makes the largest selection of local Japanese sake available
[261.06s -> 267.27s]  in the country and is located in downtown Tokyo. On some days, a selection of sake makes
[267.27s -> 273.82s]  our pick at a grocery store. If you're wondering if it's a sake or just water,
[273.82s -> 282.26s]  we really aren't sure. Sake and water. The most common question we get from our Japanese
[282.26s -> 289.38s]  customers is what kind of sake their Japanese food is. Most don't have a clear definition
[289.38s -> 293.62s]  of what they are calling a sake and how you will know if your product is sake.
[294.50s -> 300.46s]  In reality, we are talking about a whole different animal our customers are. If you
[300.46s -> 306.65s]  don't know the difference between sake and water, you have like four taste buds.
[306.65s -> 329.02s]  That's not something wrong there. How about this one? Okay, how about this one?
[329.02s -> 345.19s]  Jerma loves sake. On his stream he drank it all night. Jerma loves sake. On his stream,
[345.19s -> 349.91s]  he drank it all night. And in the morning, he goes to sleep in the corner because he
[349.91s -> 355.29s]  can't handle the guilt he's feeling. His father is a well-off industrial billionaire
[355.29s -> 359.53s]  with three children, including a son in law who has a real estate business.
[360.57s -> 365.56s]  On the first day of school, the boy who plays video games on his computer becomes a boy in
[365.56s -> 371.32s]  school, even if that boy is just four years old. His friends become more and more male.
[371.32s -> 375.16s]  His mother has started to notice them and start sending him to the male tutors.
[376.70s -> 380.46s]  Some even start dressing up in dresses, which are so ridiculous but hilarious,
[380.46s -> 386.31s]  and then his father feels ashamed. What? The little boy who can't keep himself
[386.31s -> 392.63s]  from being in a girl's room at all times. What is going on? He starts to see a lot of young,
[392.63s -> 398.25s]  attractive female teachers. I have always been a girly boy. Like always, I wanted to be a girl.
[398.25s -> 402.68s]  I would try to be a girl like every day. And now I know that I'm a girl. The fact that I'm
[402.68s -> 406.68s]  always a girl is weird. Despite being in a girl's room at school, the boy loves his
[406.68s -> 410.20s]  favorite sports team. I miss playing basketball. It makes me feel weird when I miss a game
[410.20s -> 437.98s]  while his favorite movie. Industrial billionaire with three. Where are the two kids? Who gives
[437.98s -> 478.17s]  a shit? Who gives a shit? So I gotta say about that. How about this one? Why do I have to pick
[478.17s -> 493.54s]  them all about me? How are they gonna find something from this? I'll make one about you
[493.54s -> 498.70s]  guys. Okay, here we go. Jerma on Reddit posts such off-topic things. I was thinking of
[498.70s -> 504.01s]  something like this. But we can all make something that could be useful in a small way.
[504.01s -> 507.53s]  You just need to decide between your own personal interest, the general interest of
[507.53s -> 512.41s]  the community, and how useful it is to your friends and family. You may think it is stupid
[512.41s -> 516.65s]  to try to sell something to them, but there is no point in trying to use this as your personal ATM
[517.29s -> 522.25s]  if everyone knew about the plans. If you think the person is selling it for you,
[522.25s -> 525.69s]  they're being naive because many people are already selling something to people in good
[525.69s -> 530.47s]  conditions. As a result, most people won't buy the thing if you put a price tag on it. What
[530.47s -> 536.17s]  the fuck is happening? I think I understand what you're getting at. When a product is useful
[536.17s -> 540.49s]  to someone, it will probably eventually catch on. Not just in your case. I hope it's at least
[540.49s -> 543.69s]  useful to other people. I do feel I've been... Somebody got hit in the head with a wrench.
[545.37s -> 551.10s]  Somebody just kept restarting a computer's first sentence. I hope it's at least useful to other
[551.10s -> 555.10s]  people. I do feel I've been doing this for some time, but sometimes it's the simplest thing
[555.10s -> 558.22s]  I can do right out of cake for coffee and my co-workers. So my point is that if you're
[558.22s -> 560.86s]  thinking of buying something, don't buy it until you know what you're getting with it.
[560.86s -> 572.04s]  The thing decides whether to buy it or not. That's always not easy on Reddit. I'm not
[572.04s -> 593.27s]  doing that. Somebody told me I'm not doing that. That means I'm beyond. I met at a chat at a
[593.27s -> 610.52s]  grocery store the other day. You like doing this shit to me? Let's do it to you. No, no, no,
[610.52s -> 652.07s]  no. What did I type? Twitter is a fun website too. For that matter, you'll probably get
[652.07s -> 657.58s]  great deals on new products even with a low user count. Even the biggest name brands like
[657.66s -> 665.72s]  HSN, Sandsberry, and Kohl's sell $12 copies and tea through Amazon and will deliver for $10.
[666.68s -> 670.54s]  It's a good deal. People still use the home shopping network. I thought that was only
[670.54s -> 677.88s]  for like fucking 80-year-old women and like 95-year-old fucking men. I thought it was like
[677.88s -> 686.38s]  for 80-year-old old ladies. It's for like really, really old fucking people.
[690.23s -> 696.60s]  You know how I know that? Because my grandmother used to buy dolls off of the home shopping
[696.60s -> 705.64s]  network. Those like porcelain dolls that they would put on like the conveyor belts and like
[705.64s -> 715.64s]  move them around. Just like they'd spin around on like the little lazy Susan. She used to buy
[715.64s -> 721.45s]  them. There was a lot of dolls in that house. It was kind of scary. Anyways, and it's not a
[721.45s -> 727.22s]  waste at all. Here I am working seven days a week, which probably gets me at most $40 per
[727.62s -> 735.88s]  week, working 50 hours a week. In reality, what I would work for is less than $1.10 an hour.
[736.68s -> 742.12s]  So I don't lose money on each cup I pour through the funnel on e-commerce sites.
[745.19s -> 750.47s]  Where are you making $1.10 an hour? That doesn't sound like a very good thing.
[756.87s -> 759.59s]  And I spend it well into the future and into the bank. Also, I think it's important
[759.59s -> 763.59s]  to keep the quality of your work and your reputation high. You have to be very careful
[763.59s -> 769.70s]  about how you market your work. I know about these fraud checks. Those don't mean much to me,
[769.70s -> 772.98s]  but to others, they're the beginning of the end of your reputation in the community.
[772.98s -> 776.10s]  And you have your own company to prove to customers that you are legit.
[776.66s -> 781.05s]  I'm confident that I will go out and buy a coffee from any online coffee shop
[781.05s -> 786.73s]  within a few months of the first customer checking out my website. Now your next question
[786.73s -> 833.90s]  that I can answer. $1.10. Let's see. This shitty view count. I'm just trying to pull like metadata
[833.90s -> 843.13s]  for like views and like germa. Let's see. No, I didn't mean that. That wasn't like, I'm trying
[843.13s -> 850.09s]  to like get like the metadata to like pull info. I don't mean, I don't mean that. I'm trying
[850.09s -> 857.03s]  to get like metadata to like shitty and like view and count. And this is a great fucking view
[857.03s -> 863.72s]  count. All right, here we go. No, no, no. You're taking this the wrong way. You're taking
[868.86s -> 892.73s]  this the wrong way. Music? See? This is why I did this. Here we go. No, no, you guys are,
[892.73s -> 895.29s]  you guys are this is fucking shit little people here. What are you talking about?
[895.29s -> 903.61s]  It's fucking over 3000 people here. Six Flags is the worst amusement park.
[904.33s -> 910.01s]  Germa985 and his shitty view count sent me there. Anyway, it's an awesome park,
[910.01s -> 915.05s]  but there are many flaws in the ride. It only makes you feel like an idiot if you have
[915.05s -> 921.05s]  to pay for the entire show. There are a few places that can bring back the glory days of the 80s.
[921.05s -> 927.13s]  You can easily find a better one like the Giants Canyon. It is way too big, too short,
[927.13s -> 932.09s]  and to me too easy to park without trying or paying for. There are even those that would say
[932.09s -> 936.89s]  it is better to use a car and drive all around Germa985's park than visit one of the many
[936.89s -> 941.69s]  places that make this place worth checking out. If you see one of these, you can get
[941.69s -> 945.93s]  yourself in the park and even get a ride, but you won't regret it if you do not like it,
[946.49s -> 951.77s]  and you're looking for a way to save money, then Germa985 offers the cheapest ride of the parks,
[952.33s -> 957.77s]  which means you need to make a reservation. The rides are short, are cheap, and don't
[957.77s -> 962.73s]  disappoint, so you can enjoy the parks without spending tons of money. Germa985 himself
[962.73s -> 967.69s]  doesn't care too much about this, but I don't blame him for that. His ride was great in the
[967.69s -> 973.53s]  90s, and he does the same thing every year. I've never been disappointed by a ride.
[974.57s -> 983.48s]  They're short. That's why I wrote that. That, that, I almost just knocked over the
[983.48s -> 989.50s]  fucking bottle. No, this, the view count was fucking fantastic. Don't, don't,
[989.50s -> 993.18s]  that didn't mean that. I'm trying to just get the, like, thing to fuck up.
[1029.64s -> 1033.40s]  All right, one part all-purpose flour, two cups baking soda, and one, and one hint of,
[1034.20s -> 1047.94s]  a hint of what? Here we go. One part all-purpose flour, two cups baking soda,
[1047.94s -> 1053.62s]  and one hint of sea salt. I also add four teaspoons of garlic powder for extra flavor.
[1053.62s -> 1059.24s]  Then I roll out the loaf by laying it on parchment paper. I then lay it straight back
[1059.24s -> 1065.06s]  out and cut each section into four triangles. Then I start the second portion. I spread the
[1065.06s -> 1069.30s]  mixture onto a lightly floured surface. It takes an entire sheet of parchment to completely
[1069.30s -> 1074.50s]  cover it. I put that to work by cutting across the area between each piece of foil.
[1074.50s -> 1078.26s]  I then take them all back together and roll up the entire loaf into a sheet,
[1079.10s -> 1085.30s]  and I am back to work. When you come to these two pictures just to let things sink in,
[1086.10s -> 1092.63s]  it is like watching a roller coaster crash through a tunnel. So the dough is just amazing.
[1093.69s -> 1101.05s]  Not only beautiful, I can't believe how light it is on. Back to Six Flags.
[1102.10s -> 1134.09s]  Oh shit, what is playing in the background? Okay, nothing. How's that wrong? That's right,
[1134.09s -> 1147.05s]  right? Sound the alarms. The Witcher 3 just went on sale. Witcher is not a word. I guess
[1147.05s -> 1177.08s]  that's true. Nothing? Surprising. Okay, here we go. Sound the alarms. The Witcher 3
[1177.72s -> 1183.70s]  just went on sale today with the promise that it would be as good as the final product,
[1183.70s -> 1187.74s]  which is saying something when you are playing a game that is literally being created.
[1188.46s -> 1193.14s]  So it makes perfect sense that after all the excitement the game had for the last year,
[1193.14s -> 1199.38s]  the first one came out in 2004. That developer CD Projekt Red decided to take their next
[1199.38s -> 1203.30s]  move and deliver an HD re-release of what they are calling The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.
[1204.34s -> 1209.35s]  And with CD Projekt Red, it appears the game is going to deliver a stunning conclusion,
[1209.35s -> 1214.66s]  not just to The Witcher, but to the series itself. And I am not sure whether it should be
[1215.22s -> 1220.18s]  heralded as such even though the game already deserves recognition for being one of the
[1220.18s -> 1227.38s]  biggest best-liked games of all time, or just a bad game. It is the latter choice that is
[1227.38s -> 1232.34s]  truly important now because as the second game is coming out today as a standalone offering,
[1232.34s -> 1237.14s]  which is far better choice than its previous CD Projekt Red incarnation of The Witcher,
[1237.14s -> 1240.42s]  you can expect the CD Projekt Red version to be better. Why are there like two different
[1240.42s -> 1244.82s]  versions of this game? I've been meaning to write up a lot of this in my previous
[1244.82s -> 1250.73s]  article from the same episode of Game Politics Podcast with Tom Stoppard, but I
[1250.73s -> 1267.48s]  did not have the time at some point this weekend. Game Politics. I went to Leo's?
[1278.07s -> 1296.81s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is Leo Pee Pants. Pee Pants's parents, Ray and
[1297.37s -> 1302.25s]  Anel, have filed a wrongful termination lawsuit claiming their daughter was fired
[1302.25s -> 1308.09s]  after complaining about how long she worked, and she was denied a job with his company,
[1308.09s -> 1313.53s]  the Houston Area Network Company. Pee Pants, who is a mother of two boys,
[1313.53s -> 1318.01s]  allegedly got in trouble after complaining that she needed to sleep longer than usual
[1318.01s -> 1323.77s]  on her shift for another project. When she went to the store, her shifts extended into
[1323.77s -> 1328.81s]  the wee hours. During one of these shifts, Pee Pants reportedly fell asleep in her seat,
[1328.81s -> 1334.09s]  but did not complain and allowed Hanop to continue the project, which was taking its
[1334.09s -> 1339.32s]  toll on her health. I do not know anyone who takes vacations for any reason except
[1339.32s -> 1348.31s]  when it's just fun. That is why if there is the slightest opportunity to relieve stress
[1348.31s -> 1355.45s]  and discomfort, I will just jump on vacation, he told DailyMail.com. Pee Pants's former
[1355.45s -> 1362.12s]  supervisor, James McDaniel, reportedly told her that she would receive less pay until she
[1362.12s -> 1370.46s]  paid back her rent and a $300 bonus. After Pee Pants started working for Hanop, she said
[1370.54s -> 1380.52s]  she absolutely refused to receive salary increases after being terminated. I was not
[1380.52s -> 1385.99s]  allowed to speak with Hanop's CEO as she has the power to terminate. Why would you
[1385.99s -> 1426.41s]  ask for a salary increase? Oh my god. Now let's get a sad story. No, I gotta like,
[1426.41s -> 1449.72s]  hold on. No, this is, this is, no, this doesn't make no sense. Hold on. There you go.
[1457.32s -> 1483.13s]  Ahem. Come on. Let me tell you a sad story. My Lego collection isn't complete anymore.
[1483.13s -> 1489.43s]  I was shopping at Ikea at nine to two on the way home from work one evening and I saw the
[1489.43s -> 1495.77s]  shelf on the right with a pile of boxes. As I looked underneath for any items that might
[1495.77s -> 1505.37s]  actually fit, I kept hitting myself. What do I do with these boxes? Is it better not to
[1505.37s -> 1513.94s]  have any of them? I decided to grab my collection and find me a box store. At the
[1513.94s -> 1518.66s]  mall I found an Ikea display case with dozens and dozens of boxes covered with brightly colored
[1518.66s -> 1525.67s]  stickers. My imagination raced, making small jokes and getting creative. I walked right
[1525.67s -> 1532.38s]  up to the display case and picked up three boxes marked X7 and 715. You guessed it,
[1532.38s -> 1538.14s]  they didn't fit in here. Finally, I decided to take a walk across the store to see exactly
[1538.14s -> 1602.57s]  what made these. Sorry to say we're recalling all Legos. What? Wired via wired advertisement.
[1602.57s -> 1622.20s]  Pea pants. Nice pea pants brand. Warning, all Legos pose an immediate health risk. Okay.
[1625.00s -> 1638.62s]  Is this still going? Warning, all Legos pose an immediate health risk. In 2015,
[1638.62s -> 1644.70s]  more than 13 million toys came in for inspection and maintenance. Some two billion
[1644.70s -> 1651.00s]  toy pieces fell ill with contamination in transit, which can lead to illness. About
[1651.00s -> 1657.69s]  one million of these were children, and a further ten children were sickened.
[1657.69s -> 1661.21s]  There have been a series of tests at different toy manufacturers to determine
[1661.21s -> 1664.81s]  if they have made all changes in the way that they package certain products to ensure that
[1664.81s -> 1670.28s]  they are compliant. But in each case they found that, on average, the items remained
[1670.28s -> 1675.93s]  undamaged throughout the manufacturing process. In addition, many of the changes were made
[1675.93s -> 1680.73s]  on the assumption that the children's toys would remain safe. It seems like that assumption
[1680.73s -> 1685.53s]  is incorrect, said Michael D. Lipscomb, a spokesman for the United States Consumer
[1685.53s -> 1688.97s]  Product Safety Commission, which is responsible for regulation for toy safety.
[1689.78s -> 1693.78s]  At least some of these pieces that have fallen in line are not actually toys.
[1693.78s -> 1721.61s]  The story continues. But ten children? Okay. At least some of the pieces that have fallen
[1721.61s -> 1726.89s]  in line are not actually toys, but rather sculptures. They don't really look like any
[1726.89s -> 1734.47s]  sort of real thing. A man holding up a real human skull? The whole thing is really disturbing,
[1734.47s -> 1739.75s]  and it shows that the concept of toy violence has definitely fallen out of favor in contemporary
[1739.75s -> 1744.79s]  society. It's really important to note, though, that the artwork on these sculptures
[1744.79s -> 1750.97s]  is actually, actually just plastic. Most of the pieces were created by artist Robert Court
[1750.97s -> 1755.69s]  over 30 years ago, though there are some in the collections of museum branches across the
[1755.69s -> 1761.85s]  world, like the Japanese Kiyoshi Matsumoto Museum in Kyoto. These aren't some cheap,
[1761.85s -> 1767.48s]  cheap, cheap toys. I'm not making my point, by the way. If you saw the images in the videos
[1767.48s -> 1770.60s]  in these slides, you probably think that the toys have gotten increasingly violent.
[1771.85s -> 1776.01s]  For the truth is that toy violence has gone down in the last 50 years or so,
[1776.01s -> 1793.43s]  but only slightly. It didn't decline. In fact, it has gotten way, way better. That's
[1793.51s -> 1799.03s]  I mean, come on. What a great story. Toy violence has gone down in the last 50 years.
[1809.51s -> 1816.18s]  The truth is toy violence has gone down in the last 50 years or so, and that toy violence has
[1816.18s -> 1821.22s]  fallen under control. Said Mary Jane Farkas, professor of child development at the University
[1821.22s -> 1826.18s]  of Wisconsin, who has developed a method for measuring the number of toys per student
[1826.18s -> 1832.90s]  for testing toy violence. In those 50 years, the research shows that toys have become a small
[1832.90s -> 1838.63s]  part of society. I am delighted to report that there is widespread agreement about the
[1838.63s -> 1844.07s]  problem of toy violence. As recently as 2000, an article in New York Times magazine by one
[1844.07s -> 1850.15s]  of Dr. Farkas' graduate students quoted a leading pediatrician, Dr. Jeffrey Cohen,
[1850.15s -> 1855.69s]  who stated that a great many children with auto- What? What does this have to do with toys?
[1856.70s -> 1871.18s]  And there were no safe levels. What? The government is caught at the wrong end of
[1871.18s -> 1890.12s]  the conflict turns to violence. What does this have to do with the toys? Oh my god.
[1890.68s -> 1943.93s]  This is a fucking risky, scary fucking website. This is not what you think it's going to be at
[1943.93s -> 1953.45s]  all. No, no, no, no. This is like, it's just a rule book. This is no, this is not what I,
[1953.45s -> 1999.51s]  hold on. Okay. Why are we always in constant conflict? That is the big question in politics.
[1999.59s -> 2007.46s]  The question that haunts our lives, our countries, our culture. Because when your side doesn't win,
[2007.46s -> 2011.86s]  when your side has to come up with something new or new ways of doing things, how do you
[2011.86s -> 2018.95s]  think about those opportunities? It never seems right. Do people say to you, what's wrong with
[2018.95s -> 2026.89s]  you? Or are you actually afraid every day to lose? You have a job. I had a job before and
[2026.89s -> 2033.66s]  it was good. And it was good. And now that I have a job, I'm a lot more proud of it now.
[2034.55s -> 2041.29s]  Why are we willing to get paid in cash? Because I can have a place to stay if my mom wants that,
[2041.29s -> 2048.02s]  and I can do the shopping. Even when I used to go to the stores and pay $5.50, I was a lot
[2048.02s -> 2053.22s]  more afraid that they would take off me on a day I didn't have to. Because I'm a good
[2053.22s -> 2058.02s]  customer. And I have a lot of good things working for me now and I'm very happy.
[2059.48s -> 2063.56s]  I think there is a lot of resentment, even in people who don't usually like politics,
[2063.56s -> 2067.16s]  about the way they've become part of the American system. I don't like the way that
[2067.16s -> 2079.18s]  politicians become a vehicle for a lot of things, which with its own. And then they
[2079.18s -> 2100.55s]  turned his mic off. Cut it. Cut his mic. Cut his mic. Nobody starts a speech like this.
[2101.19s -> 2105.83s]  Nobody comes. Nobody goes to the podium. I come to you today with an epic speech.
[2107.19s -> 2116.50s]  No, why would somebody do this? You don't like get to the podium and say that. Hey,
[2116.82s -> 2139.83s]  everybody. Okay, here we go. Okay. I don't know about this one. Let's get another one.
[2139.83s -> 2145.67s]  This is too. This is like a little, this is a little over the. So that's, that's too much.
[2145.67s -> 2181.37s]  Remove the period. I'm back. They've put my airwaves back on. I come to you today with
[2181.37s -> 2188.57s]  an epic speech. I'm not here to be lectured. I'm not here to be lectured on human nature.
[2188.57s -> 2210.74s]  I am here because I know that with each passing year, the number of, oh, I come to you today
[2212.95s -> 2223.06s]  with an epic speech. Cut his mic. Cut his mic. Cut his mic.
[2242.20s -> 2251.58s]  I come to you today with an epic speech. I'm back on the airwaves. They can't shut me off.
[2251.58s -> 2257.99s]  These motherfuckers think they can silence me in the Senate. I'm here and it's designed to
[2257.99s -> 2265.13s]  highlight new challenges that we face in dealing with climate change. I understand the challenges
[2265.13s -> 2272.34s]  posed by global warming. The question I have for you, my fellow senators, is this. Do you
[2272.34s -> 2282.34s]  believe that those challenges are solvable? Like mumbling together. I don't know what you're
[2282.34s -> 2289.08s]  going to say. I don't know. Let him speak. Let him ask me. Silence. Climate change is a
[2289.08s -> 2296.25s]  question of survival. Today, many parts of the planet, including yours. I'm talking about you.
[2296.25s -> 2304.76s]  Oh, you fucking aliens. Everybody from the planet X-41 and global are facing a changing
[2304.76s -> 2311.42s]  climate. One of them that I know of is the Mediterranean Sea. As the world's most important
[2311.42s -> 2316.62s]  trading partner, the United States cannot afford to lose our global position as a major
[2316.62s -> 2322.94s]  investor. To ensure access to our global trading partners, we need to protect our waters,
[2322.94s -> 2328.62s]  our marine environment, and our airwaves and coastal areas. The U.S. Senate must commit to
[2328.62s -> 2334.94s]  a comprehensive approach to managing the risk caused by rising seas, including a plan to
[2334.94s -> 2341.66s]  reduce our nation's dependence on oil and gas. I urge you today to join me at this historic
[2341.66s -> 2346.78s]  moment in time when the United States cannot fail to act on global threats,
[2346.78s -> 2357.10s]  because I know it cannot succeed. In my view, it's that moment in time. This. Cut his mic.
[2418.82s -> 2423.22s]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back. They think they can silence me and get me out of the
[2423.22s -> 2430.79s]  Senate. What the fuck do they know? They don't know shit. You won't silence me. I am the
[2430.79s -> 2438.74s]  Senate. I am everything. I come to you today with a story of my intestinal issues that are
[2438.74s -> 2446.15s]  very important. In May of 2013, I visited a local doctor who prescribed me some generic
[2446.15s -> 2456.14s]  antibiotics. She told me I needed to increase the dosage, and this is a rationale. Oh,
[2456.14s -> 2461.26s]  what's he going to say? Oh, shoot. How dare he? Well, I say, shut up, everybody. Sit
[2461.26s -> 2468.06s]  down. I said sit down. If you go higher with this drug because of the symptoms of
[2468.14s -> 2475.64s]  chronic low-grade sepsis, then you're going to get the same result. I believe her. When I
[2475.64s -> 2482.38s]  started doing yoga, my skin began itching. As a student of yoga and a student of biochemistry,
[2482.38s -> 2487.46s]  I know better than to blindly ingest large numbers of antibiotics. The idea of doing
[2487.46s -> 2492.30s]  an increased dosage of antibiotics to see if the skin response would improve is ridiculous,
[2492.30s -> 2497.13s]  and I would rather not use such dangerous, powerful, and often deadly medicines.
[2497.13s -> 2503.18s]  Before I begin, let me share you a story. My wife left my family one year earlier than I did.
[2504.71s -> 2513.83s]  We met on the web. She was studying for a certification exam. We were married in
[2513.83s -> 2520.07s]  September 2012, and early 2012 my wife had an atrial bleeding that I suspected.
[2527.22s -> 2548.14s]  Ugh. God, it's fine. I wonder the rest of the story. So do I.
[2553.00s -> 2630.90s]  Why do we keep letting this guy back in? I'm not doing anymore. This is the last one.
[2630.90s -> 2640.47s]  All right. Hold on. That's not. No. That one ain't going to. That's a gaffe. Yeah,
[2640.47s -> 2643.67s]  you got that right. That's a gaffe. I ain't going to do a gaffe on stream.
[2645.70s -> 2669.38s]  Uh, I'm going to whatever. Who cares? Uh, it's just nothing.
[2672.63s -> 2679.75s]  The Senate will now hear section T 47 article 8236. Will the Senator from Kentucky please
[2679.75s -> 2687.48s]  reiterate his position? Thank you for your attention. Senator Graham, Senator McConnell,
[2687.48s -> 2691.83s]  Senator McConnell, just so everybody understands. I've been advised by the
[2691.83s -> 2696.39s]  office of the deputy attorney general or deputy AG to defer to the confirmation of Mr. Rosenstein.
[2697.26s -> 2702.78s]  My position on appointment will remain unchanged. Senator Graham, Senator McConnell,
[2702.78s -> 2706.70s]  Senator McConnell, I defer appointment until you can get your head around the situation.
[2706.70s -> 2710.06s]  However, for the record, I remain totally open to the Senate going either way.
[2710.78s -> 2715.42s]  So I do ask that you will allow me to give the floor time to review any and all options
[2715.42s -> 2719.98s]  that you have at your disposal, not just the one which you have set out today. I appreciate
[2719.98s -> 2723.90s]  your Senator, your consideration and commitment to the rule of law. Now, thank you, Mr. President.
[2723.90s -> 2727.26s]  I would appreciate the chance. This is just a boring one. This is just, this is, this is,
[2727.26s -> 2761.58s]  this one sucks. This is a gaffe. I got to get one more of these dumb speeches in. I do.
[2761.58s -> 2791.70s]  Cut it. Cut it. Cut it. Cut his mic. No, this is, no, this got fucked up.
[2792.26s -> 2800.12s]  This got fucked up. It got messed up. It was only like three sentences. It wasn't even
[2800.12s -> 2819.46s]  worth reading. That wasn't a gaffe. It's having trouble with this one. He's
[2819.54s -> 2826.76s]  limiting. All right. Give me, give me some, give me some, um, do religion. No, it's having
[2826.76s -> 2833.24s]  trouble with it. It can't do this one. Todd Howard speaks from the White House.
[2833.80s -> 2846.54s]  I'm not going to, Todd Howard speaks from the White House. I think this site might be,
[2846.54s -> 2876.76s]  I think it's, I think it's down. Shit. Cut the mic. No, no, no, no. Wait a minute.
[2876.76s -> 2879.40s]  I'm just seeing if one word will do anything. I think it's, I think it's dead.
[2881.24s -> 2902.81s]  I'm going to try refreshing the page. Maybe it's dead. I think it's dead.
[2902.81s -> 2913.64s]  Once upon a time in German 985's backyard. Well, if it comes back, I'll do it.
[2913.64s -> 2924.78s]  They finally cut your mic. I guess they did. It'll come back. Just give it a moment.
[2924.78s -> 2944.79s]  It'll return. Socket. I just, I just have one. What are you talking about?
[2944.79s -> 2951.62s]  I'm pacing myself with this. All right. AMA, ask me anything. Let's go.
[2953.37s -> 2964.78s]  Ask anything. Is it a bottle of shampoo? Yeah. It does look like it. You're right.
[2964.78s -> 2978.10s]  It looks like a bottle of shampoo. Hey, what do you do? Are you still doing the trial stream?
[2978.10s -> 2984.09s]  No, unfortunately not. We gave up on that when it got too late, too long, but don't worry.
[2984.09s -> 2991.10s]  Something way better is going to replace it. And it's going to be, I don't want to ruin it.
[2991.10s -> 2995.08s]  You're going to like it. It has to do with the dunk tank stream, but there's going to
[2995.08s -> 3005.03s]  be way more than that. It's been a while since I've done like an elaborate stream,
[3005.03s -> 3010.68s]  like a produced elaborate stream. This is going to be worth it. I got a really,
[3010.68s -> 3017.80s]  really, really interesting team involved in this one. What's my favorite TV show?
[3017.80s -> 3023.40s]  Curb Your Enthusiasm, Always Suddenly Philadelphia, and Ren and Sniffy.
[3034.42s -> 3039.51s]  Deadly Clowns there. I wouldn't say it's a clown stream, but the clowns will be there.
[3045.69s -> 3053.27s]  Still dead. Damn it. Greenscreen Encore stream is going to be the 29th of June. Yes,
[3053.27s -> 3062.04s]  it's coming back. What are my thoughts on Sekiro? I beat it on stream. I did beat Sekiro on stream.
[3062.04s -> 3067.32s]  It was great. It was really, really, really fucking hard though. Harder than I think any
[3067.32s -> 3069.88s]  of the other games before. And maybe it's because the controls were different and the
[3069.88s -> 3073.08s]  game was a little different, but I thought it was harder than any other game that they
[3073.08s -> 3090.71s]  have made. What are my thoughts on German 985? I think it's all right. When are we getting
[3090.71s -> 3094.71s]  a three and four year badge? Bloerdau is right now working on a bunch of new stuff.
[3096.39s -> 3102.23s]  I've already seen preliminary pieces of it. I think within the next two or three weeks
[3102.87s -> 3109.64s]  we'll have some more stuff on the channel. What would my fursona be? A frog. We already
[3109.64s -> 3124.60s]  talked about this. Come on, come back. I was having fun. Are you going to do something on
[3124.60s -> 3130.15s]  the 18th? That's my birthday. Dr. Zutzu, we're going to celebrate your birthday. Just
[3130.15s -> 3136.18s]  pretend. Okay, ready? Clip this. I want Dr. Zutzu to clip this. Hey, what's going
[3136.18s -> 3142.79s]  on everybody? It is June 18th, 2019. And we are here. We've got a very important day
[3142.79s -> 3145.67s]  here. We've got something going on here. We've got Dr. Zutzu's birthday is today.
[3146.39s -> 3159.91s]  Happy birthday, Dr. Zutzu. It is June 19th. Just wrong date. What was the date? 18th. Cut
[3159.91s -> 3165.66s]  it. Hey, it's June 18th, 2019. Welcome to the stream, guys. Just turned the stream
[3165.66s -> 3172.18s]  on for the first time. June 18th, 2019. And yeah, we've got a very important thing
[3172.18s -> 3175.70s]  going on here. We've got Dr. Zutzu's birthday. First of all, that's really important to say that.
[3177.19s -> 3183.34s]  June 18th. This is today's date. Happy birthday, Dr. Zutzu. Hell yeah. Can we get some Dr.
[3183.90s -> 3190.82s]  birthday Zutzu in the chat, please? Happy birthday. Because it's today. Today is the
[3190.82s -> 3196.31s]  day. It is June 18th. Today. That's the day it is. All right, come on. Come back.
[3206.33s -> 3223.85s]  Have you ever peed in somebody else's pants? Yeah, I think so. I had hand
[3223.85s -> 3229.66s]  be downs for my brother. And when I was like six or seven years old, I definitely peed my pants.
[3231.19s -> 3247.26s]  And I peed in my brother's pants. So yes. Yes, I pee pants. You have a brother? I do.
[3247.26s -> 3259.03s]  I have an older brother and I have an older, I got siblings. How am I feeling tonight? I'm
[3259.03s -> 3274.01s]  feeling pretty good. All right. Nobody click this machine. What's my least favorite part of
[3274.01s -> 3276.97s]  Massachusetts? Well, I don't live there anymore. But when I did live there with the rain,
[3278.74s -> 3284.78s]  I hated the damn rain. It fucking rained like a hundred days a year in Massachusetts and it
[3284.78s -> 3333.00s]  just drove me nuts. Shit. I think we might be out of luck here. Damn it. Time for GeoGuessr.
[3333.00s -> 3338.66s]  No, no, we got it. I'll take one more question. One more. I got one more question available
[3338.66s -> 3346.58s]  here. Did you put MA because you can't spell mass ban that person for life?
[3347.59s -> 3353.22s]  Oh, German lied about the clown car. Did I? Did I lie about the clown car? You're going
[3353.22s -> 3358.09s]  to have to change your username in a few weeks. In like a month, in like a month to
[3358.09s -> 3368.92s]  two months, you're going to have to change your username. It's real. Yes, it is real.
[3375.18s -> 3378.94s]  DrunkGermaReveals. No, no, no. This is fine. We can talk about this.
[3382.82s -> 3388.18s]  Without getting more. AdventureMFDan, five community subs. Thank you.
[3389.13s -> 3393.77s]  And German lied about clown car. Also community subs. Thank you for that.
[3396.38s -> 3404.36s]  At some point in August, there is going to be a stream on this channel that's going to be
[3404.36s -> 3410.68s]  huge. Lightning Rider, five community subs. Thank you, Lightning Rider.
[3410.68s -> 3413.96s]  It's actually going to happen now. There's a team of people that are working on this with me.
[3414.52s -> 3417.80s]  It's taken me a long fucking time to find the right group of people.
[3418.52s -> 3421.48s]  I've been trying to get this to work for like almost six to seven months,
[3422.71s -> 3427.83s]  talking to people at Twitch, talking to people through help with the producer friend that I
[3427.83s -> 3433.59s]  have. And finally, I finally got a group of people that kind of know what to do and know
[3433.59s -> 3441.62s]  how to do it. I know it's been a long time since something elaborate has been done on the
[3441.62s -> 3448.07s]  stream. It'll make up for it. I promise. I promise that this will make up for like the
[3448.07s -> 3457.72s]  six to eight months of no big stream. I promise. And it's going to be Sam and Max Season 3.
[3457.72s -> 3461.40s]  I finally got a group of people. I got a group of people together to download the game
[3461.40s -> 3471.64s]  for me and like load it onto my hard drive. No, it's for real. I've talked about this stream
[3471.64s -> 3475.80s]  before, but it's much more elaborate. I'm going to put a bunch more time and a bunch more money
[3475.80s -> 3483.35s]  into it. And if it works, I hope you have a lot of fun on it because it's something I don't
[3483.35s -> 3491.78s]  think has been done yet so far on this website. He's like talking it up a little.
[3491.78s -> 3498.09s]  He's talking himself up a little. No, it's going to be fun. Five more subs just came in.
[3498.57s -> 3506.34s]  Who just gave the five community who just gave five subs? Magellan. Thank you Magellan for the
[3506.34s -> 3512.87s]  five subs. I talked about it in the discord a little bit earlier like yesterday on another
[3512.87s -> 3523.94s]  website. Jermis, promise. What did I promise? Eventually at some point before I stop streaming
[3523.94s -> 3528.42s]  and doing anything to do with online stuff, I'm going to have a clown car. It's going to
[3528.42s -> 3536.49s]  happen. It will happen eventually. Yeah. There is going to be a clown car on this stream
[3536.49s -> 3545.46s]  that I'm talking about right now. I fucking 100% promise. Yes. Thank you The Unravelling
[3545.46s -> 3548.34s]  for the two- You have no idea what's going to happen with this. You have no idea.
[3553.67s -> 3560.06s]  It'll be fun. And if it's not, then I fucking tried. Anyways, it rained like-
[3562.70s -> 3570.02s]  We've got more subs that came in. Hold on. But I do apologize for the time it's taken
[3570.02s -> 3574.36s]  to do another one of those streams. The last big stream that was on this channel was-
[3575.00s -> 3583.98s]  What the hell was it? It was like the- New Year's Eve? January 1st? That's a long time.
[3586.44s -> 3590.65s]  It'll be worth the wait. As long as this works the way that I want it to. It'll be worth the
[3590.65s -> 3598.12s]  wait. February, March, April, May, June. It's been five damn months. That's too long.
[3601.77s -> 3613.80s]  All right. Let's do this one. This one is working. This one's not even good.
[3614.52s -> 3659.77s]  No. No more Senator bullshit. What should I do? Should I type? This one's- I'm just going to read
[3659.77s -> 3666.78s]  it. Cut is mic now. Let's go. Hey, here we go. We're the Misfits. We're having a blast
[3666.78s -> 3670.62s]  playing together here and then we get the opportunity to have a little fun. The fun of
[3670.62s -> 3676.58s]  putting on a performance. It's totally a new dynamic. This new dimension of who we are
[3676.58s -> 3680.58s]  having this conversation, this feeling we're doing this for each other, this mutual respect,
[3680.58s -> 3686.47s]  this intimacy, the love of music. We're so inspired by and feel this chemistry. I feel it.
[3687.11s -> 3691.13s]  That's the power of this club and this vibe. There's no question that we're going to hit
[3691.13s -> 3696.25s]  each other. What? But we're also going to hit each other with our musical abilities that we
[3696.25s -> 3701.53s]  share. We're going to give each other props and to use our bodies and our minds. It's
[3701.53s -> 3706.39s]  the most fun thing we've been doing since the day we came here. And that's where the
[3706.39s -> 3712.33s]  fun really begins. If we're going to start it, it'll happen. We'll start with a group dance
[3712.33s -> 3717.21s]  and see what happens. We definitely won't be stopping until we start it. It's been a fun,
[3717.21s -> 3721.72s]  fast learning moment for everyone here. We have fun doing this, but we're not afraid to be
[3721.72s -> 3726.84s]  ourselves. We're still open-minded. Just go for it. And we're not afraid to play any
[3726.84s -> 3767.19s]  instruments. Are these lyrics? Nah, this is... I just pulled like the what is Twitch.
[3791.69s -> 3797.21s]  Is this a real... I don't know if this is a real person. Who is the best streamer on
[3797.21s -> 3801.58s]  Twitch? Possible answers for this question, in my opinion, all depend on the game they
[3801.58s -> 3805.91s]  are making. On the one hand, they could be streamers working through different channels
[3805.91s -> 3810.42s]  that work around the same time frame. On the other hand, they could be streamers
[3810.42s -> 3816.09s]  playing different games. Do you know how many streamers you would add back into one channel
[3816.09s -> 3821.77s]  to fill an existing gap? I'd like to see Twitch TV and any of the smaller stream programs
[3821.77s -> 3828.87s]  such as The Dude for You add a dedicated one to fill this void. Is there a time limit you
[3828.87s -> 3834.34s]  think needs to be exceeded during stream hours? Absolutely a time limit. It depends on how big of
[3834.34s -> 3838.82s]  a gap you want to fill, how long it takes you to fill that gap, and if you plan on doing that
[3838.82s -> 3844.33s]  over and over in one run. The best solution for me is having a dedicated channel that I
[3844.33s -> 3848.49s]  can create for myself on a consistent basis with other streamers. I may create a few
[3848.49s -> 3852.94s]  dedicated streams, but most of them are only for personal use when I stream. Where
[3852.94s -> 3856.54s]  does your stream come from? Is there anything that you don't want people to see online?
[3857.64s -> 3862.52s]  No, I don't pay people anything for their time. No one does. My channel is a completely independent
[3862.52s -> 3882.95s]  one where I own the rights to it. Okay, can I get something out of here? German 95 is the
[3882.95s -> 3890.31s]  best stream on Twitch. TV slash twitch.tv slash kiddofly is the best stream on stream. Steam.
[3890.31s -> 3909.26s]  You should watch the live stream. Good luck. Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[3909.42s -> 3934.82s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why? Why is that near? Oh, what the fuck? What? Oh, get the
[3934.82s -> 3969.54s]  fuck out of here. Dog shit, come on. Well, alright. Let's uh, let's go back here.
[3984.12s -> 3992.49s]  Why is that shit gonna come on man? Like what? The fuck. We're gonna have to do a
[3992.49s -> 4016.97s]  blank screen beforehand now. Come on. What? I'm really glad that I still haven't blacked out.
[4016.97s -> 4033.21s]  I still have it gone, because this one wasn't good either. I'm glad it's still on a black screen,
[4033.21s -> 4036.73s]  so you can't see what... like what the... why are we getting such bad ones now?
[4036.73s -> 4071.27s]  All right, this is gonna be fine. All right, okay, we're back.
[4075.51s -> 4084.31s]  My favorite ice cream is the one that tastes totally like ice cream, without all the chocolate
[4084.31s -> 4087.99s]  flavor. So all those of you who are craving a little more of that flavor, I'd recommend
[4087.99s -> 4092.23s]  going for the creme de creme. There's always a good chance you'll find one on sale.
[4094.10s -> 4098.87s]  You know, my favorite chocolate flavor is the chocolate crave. It's like ice cream, but only
[4098.87s -> 4105.11s]  fair, since it has an added kick of chocolate flavor. Chocolate cream is my favorite, as it's
[4105.11s -> 4110.47s]  just as tasty as what you'll find at your favorite candy store, only without more flavor,
[4110.47s -> 4116.10s]  since you get the real experience. Finally, you can also find my favorites, the flavors of
[4116.10s -> 4121.11s]  the sweet chocolate ice cream, like the one you can find at your local Dairy Queen. They
[4121.11s -> 4125.27s]  can be thick and creamy while still being crunchy and chewy, like the ones we found
[4125.27s -> 4128.79s]  earlier. So next time you're craving dessert and think about spending some of your money to get
[4128.79s -> 4197.10s]  ice cream, you may want to check this section out. Here we go. The takes of the Tomb Raider
[4197.10s -> 4204.12s]  release date and new DLC content as a result. We're still very excited for our fans to get
[4204.12s -> 4208.60s]  their hands on a limited edition Fallout 4 t-shirt and collectible mad dog figurine.
[4208.60s -> 4214.79s]  All we need now is to finish our work on the other add-on content for the game.
[4214.79s -> 4216.23s]  Source official play- that's it.
[4287.67s -> 4289.27s]  Another unknown player.
[4326.74s -> 4337.83s]  Here we go. I don't know what the fuck that was. I don't know what that was.
[4337.83s -> 4338.87s]  I don't know what that was.
[4341.75s -> 4359.82s]  That- what the fuck was- I typed in Fallout 76 music. I'm not gonna get in
[4359.82s -> 4363.22s]  fucking trouble for this anyway. Yeah, country road.
[4371.58s -> 4376.66s]  Fallout 76 Battle Royale mode is going to change everything.
[4376.74s -> 4381.78s]  A true story set in the time when a nuclear war between Earth and the Red Room was breaking out
[4382.71s -> 4388.78s]  and you are the leader of the resistance. Play as either the protagonist and your trusted henchmen
[4389.34s -> 4394.86s]  or as a lone ranger or vault dweller. Each will face different challenges and will encounter
[4394.86s -> 4400.79s]  different bosses as they go to defend the world from certain forces. They will of course be
[4400.79s -> 4405.59s]  accompanied by their companions and if everything goes according to plan, your choice as the
[4405.59s -> 4411.80s]  story's hero will save the day. The game will take place in a post-nuclear world and every
[4411.80s -> 4416.44s]  character is completely independent. Their personalities will determine who they become
[4416.44s -> 4422.92s]  and how it ends with. Your choices will influence a few other people who live in that world
[4422.92s -> 4427.88s]  and affect your survival and the direction of your adventure may lead because there really is
[4427.88s -> 4433.29s]  only a few people that still play this game. There's eight people on a server. Your choice
[4433.29s -> 4436.89s]  as a leader will determine the fate of the people here on Earth and whether they will
[4436.89s -> 4442.97s]  continue forward. The world you play through is a unique and dynamic landscape and if you're
[4442.97s -> 4448.65s]  lucky, you'll find a companion. If not, it isn't out of the question that you'll encounter
[4448.65s -> 4453.54s]  another. There's plenty of time to take care of your companions if you haven't already
[4453.54s -> 4457.14s]  because that's all you fucking did in Fallout 4. That's the only thing you did. That's all
[4457.14s -> 4461.70s]  you did. You take care of your town and give them supplies and shit. The action will take
[4461.70s -> 4483.96s]  place in a huge open world. The entire world will be littered with hidden objects. Cut the
[4483.96s -> 4494.23s]  mic. Somebody wrote, you really weren't kidding, this really is your worst stream.
[4495.83s -> 4520.86s]  When I did this fucking card game and how was I supposed to know? I did my damn best. That's
[4520.86s -> 4539.37s]  all you can do. What happened on 542? What happened on that one? Can't blame somebody
[4539.37s -> 4549.86s]  for trying. It was, I still had a good time. It's okay. You can't hit a home run. Sometimes
[4549.86s -> 4567.05s]  you ground out to the first basement. I still had fun. Do the money phone? What's the money,
[4567.05s -> 4575.96s]  what's money phone? Money phone? I don't know what that, I don't know what you mean.
[4583.74s -> 4587.22s]  I didn't rip the cards. What are you talking about? No, I just went like this.
[4587.94s -> 4600.78s]  I just like shuffled them. He doesn't know. Money phone. I don't know what you mean.
[4604.42s -> 4609.05s]  I'm going to look at money phone. I'm going to look it up. What's money phone?
[4611.13s -> 4631.11s]  Money phone. Holding a stack of cash to your ear and taking a selfie to flex on people. What?
[4633.91s -> 4642.01s]  What are you talking about? I don't have any money. I don't have any cash here. What do you
[4642.01s -> 4653.66s]  mean? I have to take a selfie while I go like this? Because I went like this?
[4654.38s -> 4693.85s]  All right, I'll do it like that. Tweet it like this. I don't understand what that means.
[4693.85s -> 4701.59s]  I don't know. I have to hold it to my, I can't do that. I can't hold it to my ear.
[4702.23s -> 4706.84s]  I'm not going to, why would I tweet that? I tweet like fucking three times a year.
[4709.85s -> 4713.37s]  Like a phone. I'm not going to hold it up to, I can't take, I can't do that.
[4714.09s -> 4719.50s]  I mean, I guess I, I'm not doing the money phone. Okay. Get somebody else to do that.
[4723.72s -> 4751.19s]  You have to. This stream sucked. God damn it. I'm like sad. I'm sad right now.
[4753.10s -> 4754.94s]  Did you at least like think it was a little fun?
[4762.74s -> 4766.58s]  Well, if you didn't like it, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hope you like the other ones.
[4766.58s -> 4772.28s]  Hope you like the next one. You're a drunk mess. I am, I am not.
[4773.51s -> 4779.59s]  Uh, there's not, there's this 15% alcohol by volume in here. I'm going to be just fine.
[4781.96s -> 4787.32s]  Um, what? That was six hours. It's been six hours. Can we do any of the little games or something?
[4787.96s -> 4802.09s]  What else can we do? I'm not ready to go yet. Not yet.
[4809.56s -> 4813.93s]  10 more community subs of cyanide. There was a lot of community subs.
[4814.73s -> 4819.48s]  I missed some too. Thank you guys. More community subs.
[4821.45s -> 4823.77s]  Rvem, thanks for the five. Cyanide, thanks for the 10.
[4825.67s -> 4828.31s]  Time to go. No, not yet. Not yet. Maybe like a little bit longer.
[4835.51s -> 4843.35s]  Flash games. Watch old, you want to watch a few old videos?
[4845.91s -> 4847.43s]  You guys thought that was fun last time.
[4855.80s -> 4859.08s]  More community. Jerma lied about the clown car. I'm gonna change that name soon.
[4859.64s -> 4868.95s]  I know I said that earlier, but thank you for the lots of community subs.
[4871.00s -> 4876.92s]  Um, it was worth a shot. It was worth a shot. It was fine. It was worth a shot.
[4880.09s -> 4884.01s]  It was worth a try. I just farted. No, I didn't. This is Cher.
[4891.14s -> 4903.91s]  Uh, he just shit his pants. What do we got? Let's go here.
[4910.31s -> 4912.55s]  The first one was fun. The second one dragged on for too long.
[4912.55s -> 4914.79s]  And the second one was just like all over the place.
[4915.43s -> 4917.98s]  Is that a night wing shirt? Yes, it is.
[4921.05s -> 4925.29s]  Let me open up. Just give me a second. Hold on.
[4932.12s -> 4944.50s]  Let's just do. No, and that's not no DOS.
[4944.50s -> 4950.70s]  That'll probably take too long. Let's. I do have to go back to the movies too.
[4951.34s -> 4957.13s]  Should we just go? Should we go back to the movies like this?
[4957.53s -> 4961.11s]  This week? What do you guys think?
[4964.02s -> 4967.78s]  It's been a long time. So I think it's, I think there's more content there to do.
[4968.42s -> 4979.62s]  I think that'd be fun. Well, what do we got going on tomorrow?
[4980.34s -> 4985.94s]  Maybe it's, maybe I should just call it six hours.
[4986.58s -> 4991.56s]  Hmm. I'll give you some insights here.
[4995.85s -> 4998.25s]  Yeah, I think, I think we'll call it. I think we will.
[4998.25s -> 5008.60s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Um, let me see.
[5008.60s -> 5015.56s]  Cause I am actually going to visit somebody. I'm visiting family this time next week.
[5015.56s -> 5020.97s]  So we got today, tomorrow. I got some shit planned. Don't worry. It would be good.
[5024.22s -> 5028.54s]  Old vids. Well, maybe we'll just do a full old video stream like this week coming up.
[5036.12s -> 5040.06s]  What's going on tomorrow? I have a few options tomorrow.
[5041.02s -> 5043.98s]  And then on Tuesday. So we're going to go.
[5044.70s -> 5051.61s]  I have some stuff to do on Monday. I've got some work to do on Monday for the channel.
[5054.15s -> 5058.49s]  I'm getting a call. Uh, but Tuesday, it will be interesting at least.
[5058.49s -> 5066.22s]  Tuesday will be that dwarf rock galactic game with star, dwarf rock galactic, whatever it is.
[5066.86s -> 5076.70s]  Something like that. Deep rock galactic. That's the one.
[5078.20s -> 5080.92s]  Uh, so tomorrow we'll do, we'll figure something out tomorrow.
[5080.92s -> 5083.40s]  There's a few games I could play. We're going to do, uh,
[5084.20s -> 5092.20s]  Hey, that's, that's to be determined. I'm not going to play days gone tomorrow,
[5092.20s -> 5097.40s]  but that's it. I'll call it six hours.
[5098.76s -> 5100.92s]  Hope you had fun. I hope you thought it was interesting at least.
[5101.64s -> 5107.24s]  I know it may have been a little different and maybe, maybe not the best idea,
[5107.24s -> 5110.12s]  but it wasn't worth a shot. I had fun. I did.
[5110.92s -> 5117.46s]  And then I had to call it. So thank you for watching. See you tomorrow for something.
[5119.58s -> 5122.46s]  Destroy the cards. No, these were expensive. These were fucking expensive.
[5122.46s -> 5123.82s]  I'm not going to destroy these. They were expensive.
[5126.01s -> 5138.34s]  These things were like 50 bucks for three decks. Cut as Mike. I'll see you tomorrow.
[5139.53s -> 5143.69s]  Thanks for watching guys. We'll catch back up tomorrow.
[5144.41s -> 5148.57s]  Same time, three or four o'clock. It's not that bad for three games.
[5148.57s -> 5150.41s]  Yeah, but I don't want to, I'm not going to rip them up.
[5150.41s -> 5158.79s]  They were still interesting. Where is the, uh, there's the outro.
[5160.58s -> 5164.28s]  We had a lot of subs, so thank you all of you.
[5168.65s -> 5173.45s]  Let's go back to the bits here. We were earlier this afternoon.
[5176.66s -> 5183.53s]  Thank you to, uh, Freudian Weapon. Thanks for the eight dolls, Freudian Weapon.
[5184.17s -> 5190.39s]  Hey, Jeremy, I didn't realize Tuesday was your eight-year internet anniversary.
[5190.39s -> 5193.35s]  So happy anniversary. Thanks for eight years of laughs.
[5193.35s -> 5194.79s]  You've impacted me more than you could know.
[5195.91s -> 5200.31s]  I wanted to celebrate properly tonight, but the liquor store was all out of fancy streamer wine.
[5200.31s -> 5203.43s]  So I had to settle with sponsored YouTuber IPA instead.
[5204.23s -> 5207.18s]  Well, thank you. Hopefully it was good.
[5207.98s -> 5210.89s]  It has been eight years. It's been a long time.
[5217.16s -> 5221.00s]  Sometimes I forget how long that's been. It's been ages.
[5221.64s -> 5226.12s]  It's almost a decade of being on the internet.
[5229.64s -> 5231.16s]  Thanks for the eight bucks, Freudian Weapon.
[5231.80s -> 5234.28s]  Thanks for celebrating my eight-year anniversary.
[5235.93s -> 5237.93s]  Mr. Sneak Man, thanks for the three dolls and 40 cents.
[5237.93s -> 5239.21s]  Hey, Jeremy, great stream as usual.
[5240.02s -> 5242.98s]  Starting a TF2 Open team with my buds for the first time.
[5243.54s -> 5248.50s]  Wish Team Berb good luck so that we can channel Jaxx into our matches.
[5249.22s -> 5251.22s]  And if we keep up the good work, have a good night.
[5252.02s -> 5253.90s]  Good luck.
[5256.82s -> 5263.74s]  I wish Team Berb the best of luck in TF2 Open.
[5266.33s -> 5268.65s]  Thank you, Mr. Sneak Man, for the three dolls and 40 cents.
[5271.77s -> 5274.73s]  Thank you to the Overlord of Cookies for the three bucks.
[5274.73s -> 5276.33s]  Hey, Jerma, I was wondering if you could help me with something.
[5276.89s -> 5280.17s]  Me and a friend were hoping to get one of the WWE games
[5280.17s -> 5282.97s]  so we can make characters and watch them beat each other up like you do.
[5284.92s -> 5289.64s]  It just so happens that 2K19 is on sale for 26 bucks Canadian, so $19,
[5289.64s -> 5292.28s]  with full price being 60 USD.
[5293.24s -> 5296.20s]  And your opinion, do you think that we should get it or hold off for another one?
[5296.92s -> 5300.76s]  And if no, then which WWE game should we get instead?
[5301.40s -> 5302.52s]  Thanks and love from Canada.
[5304.01s -> 5306.65s]  Well, it depends on a few things.
[5308.70s -> 5311.18s]  Everything after 2K14 sucks.
[5312.78s -> 5313.42s]  They're terrible.
[5314.06s -> 5315.18s]  The games are fucking awful.
[5316.14s -> 5317.90s]  Their customization options are terrible.
[5319.18s -> 5321.50s]  But they've run better.
[5324.90s -> 5330.74s]  Everything before WWE 2K15 runs like shit.
[5332.20s -> 5334.36s]  But the customization is 10 times better.
[5337.86s -> 5339.22s]  So you really have to decide,
[5340.02s -> 5345.50s]  do you want a game that runs better but has less options?
[5346.14s -> 5354.12s]  Or a game that runs like crap but has tons and tons of customization options?
[5354.68s -> 5359.00s]  When you decide that is the game that you should pick.
[5361.35s -> 5363.43s]  Yeah, it's right when the console generation switched, yeah.
[5366.14s -> 5368.22s]  Unfortunately, it did go downhill.
[5368.86s -> 5372.70s]  But weirdly enough, I don't know why I'm losing my voice so much recently.
[5373.26s -> 5375.53s]  It's like a weird phenomenon.
[5375.53s -> 5380.33s]  The last two or three weeks, if I talk for more than five or six hours,
[5380.33s -> 5381.69s]  I just did my voice just drops.
[5382.33s -> 5383.61s]  I don't know why the fuck this is happening.
[5388.41s -> 5389.48s]  I don't understand.
[5390.36s -> 5391.16s]  I'm just getting old.
[5395.70s -> 5398.42s]  But yeah, that's the best way to determine which one you should play.
[5399.38s -> 5405.88s]  I was doing this weird old man senator voice for like 20 straight minutes.
[5406.60s -> 5407.40s]  Maybe that's what happened.
[5408.28s -> 5408.76s]  Probably.
[5409.40s -> 5416.74s]  But yeah, I would pick 2k14 if you've never done it before
[5416.74s -> 5418.18s]  because it's way more fun things to do.
[5418.18s -> 5421.06s]  But you have to deal with the problem times, like load times.
[5422.66s -> 5424.50s]  And it looks worse, obviously.
[5426.04s -> 5427.24s]  But hopefully that answers your question.
[5428.60s -> 5430.36s]  C4G, thanks for the 250.
[5431.08s -> 5432.46s]  Hi, Jerma.
[5432.46s -> 5434.62s]  I posted one of your clips on Tumblr a week ago
[5434.62s -> 5438.54s]  and someone shared it and called you a Himbo.
[5438.54s -> 5440.22s]  What did they mean by this?
[5440.22s -> 5441.02s]  Thanks in advance.
[5442.47s -> 5443.35s]  I have no idea.
[5444.15s -> 5445.37s]  I don't know what that means.
[5446.09s -> 5452.58s]  What did I do?
[5452.58s -> 5453.38s]  Did I do something wrong?
[5454.18s -> 5459.64s]  Caught the mic.
[5459.64s -> 5460.20s]  What did I do?
[5460.20s -> 5460.68s]  Caught the mic.
[5460.68s -> 5461.08s]  Caught the mic.
[5461.08s -> 5461.56s]  What did I do?
[5462.52s -> 5464.23s]  He doesn't know.
[5464.23s -> 5465.19s]  I don't know.
[5465.19s -> 5465.99s]  I really don't know.
[5474.60s -> 5476.84s]  An attractive but unintelligent man.
[5477.40s -> 5478.90s]  A place, come on.
[5485.64s -> 5487.32s]  I am not unintelligent.
[5487.32s -> 5487.72s]  I'm just...
[5494.10s -> 5495.06s]  It's all right.
[5495.06s -> 5496.02s]  It's okay.
[5496.02s -> 5500.79s]  But are you attractive though?
[5501.67s -> 5502.23s]  I don't know.
[5503.03s -> 5504.07s]  That's up to whoever.
[5507.24s -> 5511.11s]  The jury's out on that one.
[5511.11s -> 5513.67s]  It wasn't an insult.
[5513.67s -> 5513.99s]  I know.
[5513.99s -> 5515.19s]  I'm just playing around.
[5515.19s -> 5519.54s]  Spliceable Spleen, thanks for the $5.
[5519.54s -> 5521.22s]  Hey, Jerma, just graduated from university today
[5521.22s -> 5522.10s]  and wanted to show you some love
[5522.10s -> 5524.02s]  for getting me through some tough times.
[5524.02s -> 5525.94s]  Keep creating amazing content and I'll be here.
[5527.56s -> 5529.08s]  Thank you to the $5, Spliceable Spleen.
[5529.08s -> 5531.00s]  Congratulations on graduating university.
[5533.69s -> 5534.41s]  Much love to you.
[5534.41s -> 5535.93s]  Thanks for being around.
[5537.54s -> 5540.33s]  And I'm happy you think that this is good.
[5542.78s -> 5543.74s]  That makes me happy.
[5544.82s -> 5546.50s]  I hope you still think so.
[5546.50s -> 5547.54s]  I hope you stick around.
[5547.54s -> 5548.74s]  I hope you still think it's fun.
[5548.74s -> 5549.38s]  I really do.
[5550.18s -> 5552.01s]  I hope you still think I'm handsome.
[5552.01s -> 5553.45s]  I hope you still think I'm handsome.
[5554.09s -> 5557.42s]  But thanks for the $5.
[5560.98s -> 5566.65s]  Thank you to GTX 1080 Quad SLI for the $2.50.
[5567.45s -> 5572.01s]  Hey, Leo, I was wondering when you were going to do more VR or Dreams.
[5572.81s -> 5573.61s]  It's been a while.
[5574.33s -> 5577.21s]  And I'd love to see more epic wins and fails, JermaTV.
[5579.22s -> 5581.22s]  I will probably go back to VR.
[5585.38s -> 5586.90s]  The week after next.
[5586.90s -> 5588.26s]  So the week of like the 24th.
[5588.82s -> 5589.70s]  I'll go back to VR.
[5590.97s -> 5592.81s]  And we will do VR for a whole week.
[5593.53s -> 5595.72s]  I just, I needed to take a break from it.
[5595.72s -> 5597.08s]  It was kind of killing me for a while.
[5601.90s -> 5604.14s]  But that week of the 24th.
[5604.14s -> 5605.26s]  And what about Dreams?
[5605.26s -> 5610.14s]  Uh, Dreams is, I would probably do channel surfing on Dreams.
[5610.78s -> 5614.44s]  I feel like I can't dedicate the time necessary to make anything interesting.
[5615.00s -> 5619.26s]  I tried to, but just kind of wasn't happening.
[5621.77s -> 5623.61s]  And I'd rather dedicate time to other things.
[5625.56s -> 5632.04s]  Like, for instance, the dunk tank stream with all the other games thing.
[5633.00s -> 5635.24s]  So that's my off stream shit.
[5635.96s -> 5640.50s]  That's what I'm going to be doing off stream, at least for the next few weeks.
[5641.30s -> 5647.34s]  And that has evolved by two or three times.
[5648.06s -> 5656.02s]  So in the time when I'm not live on camera, I'm going to be working on that.
[5656.82s -> 5660.42s]  So instead of doing something like Dreams and making stuff,
[5660.42s -> 5661.38s]  I'm doing that instead.
[5661.38s -> 5664.02s]  Because that just got a lot of traction here in the last like three or four days.
[5667.50s -> 5669.58s]  But yeah, something like that.
[5669.58s -> 5673.82s]  Thank you though for the five dollars, uh, of the 250, sorry, GTX 1080.
[5675.48s -> 5677.16s]  Swiggity swanky, thanks for the five dollars.
[5677.16s -> 5678.92s]  Dr. Jerma, I have a problem with my ear.
[5678.92s -> 5682.76s]  I've recovered from a cold and I've noticed that there's still fluid stuck in my inner left ear.
[5683.56s -> 5685.64s]  That was three weeks ago and it still won't drain.
[5686.54s -> 5689.26s]  Has that ever happened to you in your 30 years of life experience?
[5689.26s -> 5689.76s]  Yes.
[5690.30s -> 5692.01s]  Uh, I'm going to tell you something.
[5694.44s -> 5695.88s]  This is not medical advice.
[5697.80s -> 5698.60s]  I am not a doctor.
[5699.32s -> 5702.78s]  This is not medical advice.
[5704.58s -> 5706.74s]  But first of all, go to a doctor.
[5708.17s -> 5710.81s]  I am not a doctor, not at all.
[5711.45s -> 5713.53s]  I have no idea what I'm doing.
[5714.17s -> 5716.57s]  This is, do not use this as medical advice.
[5717.85s -> 5724.18s]  But every time I've had water in my ear or fluid in my ear,
[5724.90s -> 5726.98s]  this is not medical advice.
[5727.86s -> 5728.74s]  Do not do this.
[5729.54s -> 5731.30s]  This is something you should not do.
[5731.30s -> 5732.34s]  Don't ever do this.
[5732.90s -> 5733.94s]  Under any circumstance.
[5733.94s -> 5735.78s]  That's what I'm telling you, to not do this.
[5737.94s -> 5743.93s]  Uh, is I do hydrogen peroxide in my ear and lie with it in my ear for like a few minutes.
[5746.92s -> 5747.80s]  Do not do that.
[5748.78s -> 5749.74s]  Never do it.
[5749.74s -> 5751.10s]  Don't ever fucking do that.
[5751.10s -> 5753.02s]  In a, don't ever do that.
[5753.02s -> 5753.52s]  Okay?
[5756.92s -> 5762.04s]  That's actually fine.
[5762.04s -> 5763.32s]  No, I'm gonna go do it right now.
[5765.75s -> 5767.03s]  You gotta be careful though, you know?
[5768.34s -> 5769.38s]  Ow, my ears.
[5776.65s -> 5778.65s]  I told you not to do that, so don't worry.
[5778.89s -> 5780.09s]  I've, I've protected myself.
[5780.73s -> 5784.07s]  But thank you.
[5784.07s -> 5786.79s]  Also thank you, but it's five dollars from spickety swanky.
[5786.79s -> 5788.76s]  Go to a doctor, they, they know what they're doing.
[5790.71s -> 5794.95s]  Cyanide Zero gave fucking a hundred bucks and a shitload of community subs,
[5794.95s -> 5796.95s]  so I gotta say right off the bat, thank you Cyanide.
[5798.52s -> 5802.36s]  Atrolux A-Trux gave a shitload of subs too, a lot of community subs tonight.
[5804.49s -> 5807.05s]  Alamitos, Alamitos, thanks for the 250.
[5808.39s -> 5812.97s]  Local streamer by the name of German 986 was arrested after plagiarizing a garden
[5812.97s -> 5814.57s]  from an innocent person and house slipper.
[5815.53s -> 5817.77s]  German was on the run from the police for a few weeks,
[5818.49s -> 5823.37s]  but was caught after the police got a tip from another streamer named Grill Master X Barbecue.
[5824.25s -> 5825.93s]  A man by the name of Mario said,
[5826.65s -> 5830.33s]  German has not been the same mentally ever since I destroyed him in Yahtzee.
[5830.89s -> 5832.65s]  I didn't even do the Mario voice.
[5832.65s -> 5834.25s]  I just like talked like Mario.
[5834.81s -> 5836.25s]  I just did Mario cadences.
[5836.81s -> 5837.53s]  I didn't even try.
[5839.29s -> 5842.25s]  That was just a guy talking.
[5842.25s -> 5843.37s]  It wasn't even Mario.
[5848.30s -> 5848.86s]  But thank you.
[5849.86s -> 5851.86s]  Thank you Atrolux A-Trux for the 10 bucks.
[5851.86s -> 5853.14s]  You're all breathtaking.
[5855.56s -> 5856.92s]  You're breathtaking.
[5856.92s -> 5858.46s]  That's what I need to say, right?
[5859.78s -> 5860.34s]  Too drunk?
[5860.34s -> 5861.14s]  No, I'm not drunk.
[5861.14s -> 5862.34s]  I'm just my voice is gone.
[5863.16s -> 5864.76s]  It's like getting worse too.
[5864.76s -> 5866.12s]  I hope it's not like this tomorrow.
[5866.68s -> 5870.26s]  I'll be in some fucking trouble tomorrow if I can't talk.
[5872.34s -> 5874.39s]  I'm not getting like laryngitis, right?
[5875.11s -> 5877.42s]  Why would that be happening?
[5883.59s -> 5885.54s]  No, I'll be all right.
[5888.55s -> 5890.31s]  Thank you for the 10 bucks though, Atrolux.
[5893.24s -> 5894.28s]  You're all breathtaking.
[5896.31s -> 5899.11s]  Oh, we also had Pigeon.
[5899.11s -> 5900.31s]  Thank you Pigeon for the 250.
[5900.31s -> 5902.15s]  Hey, Jerma, I was looking for Switch games to buy.
[5902.15s -> 5903.43s]  Uh, Switch games.
[5904.15s -> 5905.11s]  And I stumbled upon this.
[5905.91s -> 5909.83s]  It's like Space Channel 5, but you actually have to move.
[5909.83s -> 5911.19s]  I thought it'd be a really great stream.
[5911.19s -> 5913.75s]  Plus you could finally get back to 2015 Jerma.
[5914.63s -> 5916.31s]  2015?
[5916.31s -> 5917.03s]  Jerma, what do you mean?
[5919.77s -> 5921.05s]  All Jermas are good Jermas.
[5921.05s -> 5921.69s]  They're all fine.
[5921.69s -> 5922.49s]  They're all good Jermas.
[5922.49s -> 5922.97s]  What's wrong with that?
[5922.97s -> 5924.65s]  What's wrong with the 2019 Jerma?
[5925.74s -> 5926.14s]  Teen!
[5926.14s -> 5927.02s]  Oh, this is getting bad.
[5927.82s -> 5929.02s]  What the fuck is wrong with me?
[5933.64s -> 5934.44s]  Fuck.
[5934.44s -> 5937.10s]  Oh, here's the link.
[5937.10s -> 5938.30s]  Pigeon with five dollars.
[5938.30s -> 5939.74s]  Fitness Boxing Switch.
[5943.78s -> 5944.58s]  Interesting, okay.
[5947.53s -> 5949.13s]  Space Channel 5, but boxing.
[5949.94s -> 5950.82s]  I'm gonna have to have a tea.
[5953.29s -> 5954.89s]  But uh, thank you Pigeon for the five bucks.
[5956.28s -> 5957.72s]  Thank you Freudian Weapon for the 250.
[5957.72s -> 5959.96s]  For the record, I did enjoy these unlock card games.
[5959.96s -> 5961.56s]  I may even check them out for myself.
[5961.56s -> 5962.44s]  I'm glad you did.
[5963.24s -> 5967.42s]  It was an interesting idea.
[5968.94s -> 5973.18s]  I can't pretend that every idea that I have to do on stream is gonna be worth really doing,
[5973.18s -> 5975.10s]  but I think I still had fun doing it.
[5975.90s -> 5985.64s]  It's something that I wanted to try for a little while, so it's okay.
[5985.64s -> 5988.18s]  As long as you enjoy yourselves, that's all I care about.
[5988.74s -> 5990.38s]  Because I enjoyed myself too.
[5991.53s -> 5993.93s]  But thank you Freudian Weapon for the 250.
[5995.02s -> 5996.46s]  Door Cube, thanks for the 250.
[5998.26s -> 6001.22s]  These unlock games look like something that my nerdy aunt and uncle
[6001.22s -> 6002.90s]  would have funded on Kickstarter.
[6002.90s -> 6005.54s]  Play it once and then give it to me for Christmas.
[6009.27s -> 6013.99s]  Oh, that's true.
[6013.99s -> 6015.19s]  That's very true.
[6015.83s -> 6016.15s]  Yep.
[6017.64s -> 6019.08s]  Yeah, you know, you got it.
[6019.72s -> 6019.96s]  That's...
[6023.38s -> 6026.02s]  Hey, guess what I'm gonna do with these.
[6027.24s -> 6030.04s]  They're gonna get boxed back up and they're going to my nieces and nephews.
[6032.81s -> 6034.73s]  I had that idea like an hour and a half ago.
[6038.55s -> 6039.91s]  I'm gonna be that uncle.
[6039.91s -> 6043.93s]  But I didn't buy them on Kickstarter.
[6043.93s -> 6044.57s]  But they're good.
[6044.57s -> 6045.21s]  What's wrong with them?
[6045.21s -> 6046.25s]  What do you mean that's so mean?
[6046.25s -> 6048.09s]  These are like fun card games.
[6049.29s -> 6049.69s]  Things.
[6053.88s -> 6054.84s]  But thank you Door Cube.
[6055.64s -> 6059.82s]  Thank you Halo Soft Boy for the 250.
[6059.82s -> 6060.54s]  Thank you for streaming.
[6061.18s -> 6063.98s]  Your streams have been a really positive thing in my life lately.
[6063.98s -> 6065.58s]  As I've been going through some crazy stuff.
[6066.63s -> 6068.95s]  I witnessed a shooting a week ago.
[6068.95s -> 6071.19s]  But your streams in the stream archive have been helping me relax
[6071.19s -> 6072.23s]  and take my mind off things.
[6072.23s -> 6073.19s]  I'm really fucking sorry to hear.
[6073.19s -> 6074.07s]  That's fucking horrible.
[6075.11s -> 6077.53s]  Now the house flipper streams have been my favorite.
[6077.53s -> 6078.41s]  Thanks for doing what you do.
[6079.21s -> 6081.77s]  I'm...
[6081.77s -> 6082.73s]  That's fucking horrible.
[6083.29s -> 6091.72s]  Thank you for hanging out here.
[6092.68s -> 6093.48s]  Hopefully you're all right.
[6093.48s -> 6095.08s]  Hopefully everyone's okay.
[6095.72s -> 6099.37s]  I don't know what you're referring to here.
[6099.37s -> 6100.49s]  But hopefully everything's okay.
[6101.37s -> 6102.81s]  But that's fucking terrible.
[6110.84s -> 6111.80s]  Thank you for hanging out.
[6113.85s -> 6116.97s]  And I'm glad that this can be a community of somewhere to relax.
[6117.77s -> 6121.18s]  I'm okay.
[6121.18s -> 6121.74s]  Thanks.
[6121.74s -> 6122.22s]  That's good.
[6122.22s -> 6122.86s]  That's good.
[6122.86s -> 6123.58s]  That's good to know.
[6129.66s -> 6131.34s]  Take care and thank you.
[6135.30s -> 6136.34s]  And moving on from that.
[6136.34s -> 6138.82s]  We're gonna do Pasta Globs had 250 here.
[6139.91s -> 6140.47s]  Hi Jerma.
[6140.47s -> 6141.67s]  Your streams never failed to cheer me up.
[6141.67s -> 6143.51s]  So I thought I would show my appreciation with some art.
[6143.51s -> 6144.71s]  Hope you like it.
[6144.71s -> 6147.26s]  It's pretty damn good.
[6147.90s -> 6154.33s]  Get it on the screen.
[6154.33s -> 6161.35s]  What do you say?
[6161.35s -> 6162.47s]  Pasta Globs.
[6170.39s -> 6170.79s]  This hair.
[6170.79s -> 6171.59s]  Look at this hair.
[6172.31s -> 6174.12s]  I gotta do something about this hair.
[6174.76s -> 6176.94s]  It's starting to get all over the place.
[6176.94s -> 6177.90s]  It's starting to go crazy.
[6179.74s -> 6181.75s]  This is great.
[6181.75s -> 6182.15s]  Thank you.
[6182.79s -> 6188.89s]  That was Pasta Globs.
[6188.89s -> 6190.41s]  Thank you for the 250 and thanks for the art.
[6190.97s -> 6192.97s]  You look like Prince Charming.
[6195.69s -> 6197.66s]  Thank you.
[6197.66s -> 6201.32s]  Grow it out more.
[6201.32s -> 6201.88s]  I can't.
[6201.88s -> 6203.00s]  I would look like David Spade.
[6204.68s -> 6205.64s]  Thank you Pasta Globs.
[6208.46s -> 6210.70s]  We had lightning rider with five community subs.
[6210.70s -> 6212.06s]  Pogefest five community subs.
[6212.06s -> 6214.78s]  It was a lot that just flew in sub-wise.
[6216.54s -> 6217.34s]  DC Pro.
[6217.34s -> 6218.30s]  Thanks for 10 bucks.
[6218.30s -> 6218.86s]  No message.
[6218.86s -> 6220.22s]  Just 10 dollars from DC Pro.
[6221.50s -> 6222.46s]  Actually no, there is a message.
[6222.46s -> 6224.06s]  Hey Jerma, I found your channel when I was 16.
[6224.06s -> 6226.14s]  Now three years later I want to thank you for all the laughs.
[6226.78s -> 6230.07s]  Thanks for being around.
[6230.71s -> 6232.94s]  I've been watching for three years.
[6233.74s -> 6237.42s]  Thank you for the 11 bucks.
[6238.14s -> 6240.36s]  And thanks for watching.
[6240.92s -> 6244.17s]  Hope you stay tuned.
[6244.17s -> 6249.02s]  Then we had a Dork Cube 250.
[6249.02s -> 6251.10s]  The card game may have been the worst stream,
[6251.82s -> 6256.84s]  but the moment when you said my wife left our family a year before I did,
[6256.84s -> 6258.52s]  it became the best stream.
[6258.52s -> 6260.92s]  I call this predicament Schrodinger's stream.
[6272.82s -> 6278.04s]  Yeah, it's okay though.
[6278.04s -> 6280.34s]  It's okay.
[6280.34s -> 6282.74s]  I'm completely content with the card games.
[6289.93s -> 6290.65s]  It wasn't bad.
[6290.65s -> 6295.13s]  I know, but I look, I don't like to disappoint people.
[6295.77s -> 6299.66s]  And I know nobody's actually disappointed.
[6300.30s -> 6304.36s]  But I want every stream to be fun and happy,
[6304.36s -> 6306.84s]  and people interested and want to watch.
[6306.84s -> 6309.78s]  And if you see somebody that says,
[6309.78s -> 6310.82s]  I don't like this, then it's like,
[6310.82s -> 6313.70s]  fuck, I wish, I wish you did.
[6314.26s -> 6318.10s]  Now for the most part, people thought it was interesting.
[6318.10s -> 6319.62s]  And you know, but still, you know, I,
[6320.50s -> 6322.17s]  it's something I think about a lot.
[6322.89s -> 6323.85s]  I care about that shit.
[6323.85s -> 6324.41s]  I really do.
[6325.56s -> 6326.28s]  More than anything.
[6329.82s -> 6331.90s]  I don't give a shit about anything else.
[6331.90s -> 6333.42s]  I only fucking care about that.
[6333.42s -> 6333.90s]  That's it.
[6334.94s -> 6335.66s]  Nothing else.
[6339.99s -> 6341.35s]  I really hope you know that.
[6347.94s -> 6348.82s]  Not even Kim.
[6350.42s -> 6352.44s]  No, come on.
[6352.44s -> 6353.00s]  Come on.
[6353.56s -> 6354.04s]  Come on.
[6358.36s -> 6359.16s]  Oh, Jesus.
[6365.14s -> 6366.66s]  Let's get, there was a lot of community subs.
[6366.66s -> 6367.62s]  Let's get the credits on screen.
[6368.34s -> 6370.34s]  We're almost done with the bits, but let's roll these up.
[6370.90s -> 6372.70s]  And they go, there was a lot.
[6372.70s -> 6373.58s]  There was like hundreds.
[6374.30s -> 6375.90s]  It was like two or three hundreds up tonight.
[6386.87s -> 6388.63s]  You don't care about, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6388.63s -> 6389.19s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[6389.19s -> 6390.47s]  No, guys, guys, what have you done?
[6391.27s -> 6392.39s]  Guys, what have you done to me?
[6395.13s -> 6397.54s]  This is not, this is not, come on.
[6398.26s -> 6399.98s]  She's sitting here watching the stream.
[6405.70s -> 6406.98s]  No, you listen.
[6407.78s -> 6409.38s]  I'll talk to you in like five, five minutes.
[6410.10s -> 6411.14s]  Don't listen to the chatters.
[6412.98s -> 6414.26s]  They've lost all control.
[6419.10s -> 6423.10s]  But in real talk, in real words here,
[6426.55s -> 6430.47s]  the reason why I do like the card game stream is because I
[6430.47s -> 6432.87s]  want to see if I can make something interesting.
[6432.87s -> 6435.83s]  You know, it seems like something fun to do.
[6442.79s -> 6444.15s]  Better warm up that couch.
[6449.11s -> 6450.31s]  Yeah, it's all good.
[6451.75s -> 6452.39s]  It's all good.
[6453.03s -> 6454.87s]  It's all fucking gravy.
[6456.42s -> 6457.94s]  And another thing.
[6457.94s -> 6459.22s]  Let me tell you another thing.
[6460.02s -> 6471.50s]  I, turn it back, turn it back on.
[6472.06s -> 6473.10s]  Don't do that to me again.
[6473.66s -> 6475.37s]  You understand, this is my fucking stream.
[6475.37s -> 6476.17s]  Don't do that to me again.
[6478.54s -> 6480.94s]  Fucking aliens upstairs trying to control it.
[6480.94s -> 6481.90s]  You keep, keep it on.
[6482.70s -> 6483.50s]  I'm not fucking around.
[6483.50s -> 6484.14s]  Keep that shit on.
[6487.48s -> 6488.60s]  And another thing.
[6488.60s -> 6491.03s]  That's all I got.
[6492.15s -> 6493.03s]  Hey, thank you too.
[6493.03s -> 6494.87s]  It's a ghost party for the five dollars.
[6496.58s -> 6497.86s]  Hey, Jerma, every stream you do is great.
[6497.86s -> 6499.62s]  And it's a pleasure to see you doing what you want.
[6499.62s -> 6500.82s]  Don't let the haters get...
[6500.82s -> 6502.90s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, nobody.
[6502.90s -> 6505.32s]  No, there was no haters.
[6507.62s -> 6508.10s]  That wasn't...
[6509.62s -> 6516.65s]  That's not it.
[6516.65s -> 6517.77s]  There were one or two.
[6518.33s -> 6518.89s]  That's all right.
[6518.89s -> 6519.37s]  That's okay.
[6523.53s -> 6524.81s]  You can't please everybody.
[6524.81s -> 6526.65s]  When you see that one guy complain, don't let it get to you.
[6526.65s -> 6528.17s]  Only makes you more of a boomer.
[6528.17s -> 6528.89s]  No, no, no, no.
[6529.53s -> 6530.17s]  I'm fine.
[6530.17s -> 6531.21s]  I'm just fine.
[6531.21s -> 6531.61s]  Don't worry.
[6534.18s -> 6535.54s]  I was one of the haters.
[6536.26s -> 6537.30s]  You understand?
[6537.30s -> 6538.34s]  I'm going to flip this on you.
[6540.41s -> 6541.29s]  I was one...
[6541.29s -> 6541.77s]  It was me.
[6542.65s -> 6543.21s]  It was me.
[6544.09s -> 6546.04s]  It wasn't in chat.
[6546.04s -> 6546.52s]  It was me.
[6553.53s -> 6554.81s]  You're your biggest hater.
[6558.58s -> 6559.38s]  It was me.
[6560.26s -> 6561.06s]  I was the one.
[6561.06s -> 6562.18s]  It was the mirror.
[6562.18s -> 6563.46s]  The mirror held up in front of me.
[6563.46s -> 6565.30s]  It was like, oh, shit, it's been me the whole time.
[6575.11s -> 6576.63s]  You were those thousands of people.
[6579.05s -> 6580.41s]  But there was a lot of subs.
[6580.41s -> 6580.89s]  Thank you, guys.
[6585.56s -> 6587.32s]  We have a few more bits to get through.
[6593.34s -> 6595.34s]  But it's a ghost party thanks to the five dollars.
[6598.46s -> 6599.34s]  It's not...
[6599.34s -> 6600.22s]  Nobody was like that.
[6600.78s -> 6601.82s]  We were just having a good time.
[6603.46s -> 6604.58s]  I just sometimes think...
[6605.22s -> 6605.78s]  Overthink.
[6607.24s -> 6614.58s]  If people are having a good time, you know?
[6614.58s -> 6617.22s]  Because it's what I fucking care about the most.
[6617.22s -> 6619.77s]  It's not the money.
[6619.77s -> 6621.13s]  It's not the fucking view count.
[6621.13s -> 6622.97s]  It's not the worst view count, right?
[6622.97s -> 6623.53s]  It's not that was...
[6624.41s -> 6625.13s]  It's nothing.
[6625.13s -> 6626.01s]  I'm not about that at all.
[6632.14s -> 6632.62s]  Money.
[6632.62s -> 6632.94s]  Money.
[6632.94s -> 6633.42s]  Oh, shit.
[6633.42s -> 6634.22s]  I said the word money.
[6637.26s -> 6638.62s]  You don't want any more money?
[6639.26s -> 6646.57s]  I look fucking greasy.
[6658.46s -> 6659.66s]  Naked streamer.
[6659.66s -> 6663.26s]  No.
[6663.26s -> 6665.02s]  But only a couple more bits to do.
[6666.20s -> 6667.88s]  And then I should see you tomorrow.
[6667.88s -> 6669.24s]  Unless for some reason something's wrong.
[6669.24s -> 6670.44s]  Because I don't think anything will be wrong.
[6671.00s -> 6674.95s]  I almost lost my mind at the beginning of the stream, though.
[6674.95s -> 6676.41s]  It was kind of fucked up.
[6681.86s -> 6683.70s]  Any main channel uploads in progress?
[6683.70s -> 6686.50s]  No, but there is a main Twitch stream coming up.
[6687.22s -> 6690.02s]  That includes Dunk Tank and some other things.
[6693.24s -> 6695.24s]  That should be happening sooner than I think.
[6698.97s -> 6700.97s]  But thank you to Magellan for the five dollars.
[6700.97s -> 6702.81s]  Hey man, just want to jump in and say thank you for the stream tonight.
[6703.85s -> 6705.93s]  As rocky as it was, I really needed it.
[6705.93s -> 6707.69s]  And enjoyed it a lot regardless.
[6707.69s -> 6710.57s]  Even in your worst dreams and of being a gold mine of entertainment.
[6711.45s -> 6713.77s]  Also, I made a dumb video of your moment earlier.
[6713.77s -> 6714.25s]  Enjoy.
[6714.89s -> 6715.85s]  Not a screamer.
[6715.85s -> 6717.13s]  Just turn the volume down.
[6717.13s -> 6718.57s]  Well, that's kind of a funny warning.
[6719.62s -> 6720.50s]  Not a screamer.
[6721.93s -> 6722.49s]  Oh, it's...
[6722.49s -> 6723.53s]  I'm the screamer.
[6723.53s -> 6724.03s]  I get it.
[6734.66s -> 6735.46s]  When did I do this?
[6752.76s -> 6753.24s]  What?
[6753.24s -> 6754.04s]  I feel a little bit better.
[6754.60s -> 6762.12s]  I feel a little bit better.
[6776.06s -> 6779.02s]  Oh, because I was pissed off at the fucked up Twitch server.
[6780.23s -> 6781.27s]  Right, right, okay, okay.
[6782.07s -> 6783.05s]  Well, that was Magellan.
[6783.05s -> 6783.85s]  Thanks for the five dollars.
[6783.85s -> 6784.97s]  Thanks for the video.
[6784.97s -> 6786.95s]  Hope you enjoyed it.
[6786.95s -> 6789.99s]  Thank you Anything Else Show Official for the five bucks.
[6790.71s -> 6794.07s]  This was a different stream for sure, but it was still funny and unexpected.
[6794.79s -> 6798.47s]  I'm still sick, but your goofy humor has healed me a little.
[6799.03s -> 6802.31s]  Also, if you're playing the movies, I recommend checking out the mod site.
[6802.31s -> 6804.71s]  So you can put in some random and funny shit as usual.
[6804.71s -> 6805.91s]  Have fun, you goober.
[6807.51s -> 6808.79s]  Thank you Anything Else Show Official.
[6809.43s -> 6812.55s]  Oh, right.
[6812.55s -> 6814.06s]  That's wrong.
[6814.38s -> 6816.94s]  The movies might even just be the next stream.
[6817.58s -> 6820.70s]  What's tomorrow?
[6820.70s -> 6821.10s]  Sunday?
[6825.16s -> 6836.46s]  I mean, it might be tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, okay.
[6837.18s -> 6838.62s]  Maybe we'll just do that tomorrow.
[6843.00s -> 6844.04s]  Maybe we'll just do it tomorrow.
[6849.59s -> 6850.95s]  That would make some sense, right?
[6851.75s -> 6854.52s]  We'll see.
[6854.52s -> 6858.04s]  Well, if I can get that to work and I can get some mods and stuff maybe, yeah.
[6858.04s -> 6858.84s]  Let me try it out.
[6859.99s -> 6862.79s]  If not, then we'll do that at some point in the next week for sure.
[6864.22s -> 6868.92s]  Let me see what I can do with that tomorrow, but thank you.
[6871.08s -> 6871.64s]  Only a couple more.
[6871.64s -> 6872.20s]  Frodium Weapon.
[6872.20s -> 6873.40s]  Thanks for the five dollars, Frodium.
[6873.40s -> 6877.24s]  Every stream is fron- fron in one way or another to a lot of people.
[6877.96s -> 6878.92s]  Your breathtaking.
[6881.91s -> 6883.19s]  Thank you so much for the five bucks.
[6885.38s -> 6886.34s]  I do think about that a lot.
[6886.34s -> 6887.86s]  Thank you for the five dollars, Frodium.
[6888.58s -> 6889.46s]  Captain Fawful.
[6889.46s -> 6890.26s]  Thanks for the five bucks.
[6890.26s -> 6893.38s]  I was one of the comments you read about this being your worst stream.
[6893.38s -> 6895.78s]  It was just a joke and I didn't mean it.
[6895.78s -> 6898.98s]  You could do a stream where you would do nothing but eat Cheerios and I would still love it.
[6898.98s -> 6899.94s]  Keep up the great work.
[6900.58s -> 6901.62s]  That's why- I know, I know.
[6902.18s -> 6907.86s]  Look, nothing anybody said in the chat tonight was a catalyst for this.
[6908.74s -> 6911.62s]  I just- it's just something that concerns me.
[6913.16s -> 6914.28s]  Don't give them any ideas.
[6916.07s -> 6917.11s]  Every stream is fron.
[6917.75s -> 6922.34s]  But thank you, Captain Fawful.
[6922.34s -> 6924.42s]  No, nobody said anything that I didn't like.
[6924.42s -> 6926.26s]  Oh, where the heck's everybody's such a mean?
[6926.26s -> 6926.82s]  No, no, no, no.
[6926.82s -> 6927.38s]  No, no, no, no.
[6927.38s -> 6928.18s]  I hope you don't think that.
[6928.82s -> 6930.87s]  But thank you for the five dollars.
[6933.27s -> 6933.99s]  Stanktron.
[6933.99s -> 6934.71s]  Thanks for the two and fifty.
[6934.71s -> 6936.87s]  Hey, Jeremiah, I recently went to a museum in Queens
[6937.51s -> 6939.59s]  where I saw a Jim Henson exhibit.
[6939.59s -> 6941.99s]  It showcased all the original Muppets in Sesame Street,
[6941.99s -> 6943.99s]  Fraggle Rock, Puppets, etc.
[6943.99s -> 6945.43s]  I noticed you referenced them a lot.
[6946.07s -> 6947.83s]  Thanks, because Jim Henson is probably the most-
[6948.71s -> 6953.46s]  well, one of the most important media personalities to ever live.
[6955.62s -> 6957.88s]  So, I mean, Jim Henson is-
[6959.24s -> 6961.56s]  we wouldn't have so many of these things without Jim Henson.
[6962.20s -> 6964.07s]  You want to talk about influences?
[6964.07s -> 6966.39s]  I think Jim Henson might be up there for me at least.
[6967.03s -> 6970.17s]  He did a lot of really, really great things.
[6971.66s -> 6973.10s]  So, that's awesome.
[6973.10s -> 6973.90s]  Glad you got to see it.
[6974.46s -> 6981.24s]  The Muppets are completely timeless.
[6981.24s -> 6981.74s]  Forever.
[6982.28s -> 6987.40s]  Glad you got to see it, Stanktron.
[6987.40s -> 6992.28s]  Just got here. Am I late to the stream?
[6992.92s -> 6994.42s]  Eh, by a little bit.
[6997.30s -> 6998.98s]  A Freudian weapon right now.
[6998.98s -> 6999.78s]  Two-fifty, that's right.
[6999.78s -> 7001.70s]  I'm going to be that guy and be the last bits.
[7001.70s -> 7002.26s]  Have a good night.
[7002.26s -> 7002.98s]  Well, that's not true.
[7003.70s -> 7007.19s]  Because unfortunately, deusmorte gave two-fifty.
[7011.32s -> 7011.64s]  They said,
[7011.64s -> 7013.32s]  Jerma, that was possibly the worst stream ever.
[7013.32s -> 7016.04s]  The Birdhouse stream deserves an award after that one.
[7017.08s -> 7017.56s]  Just kidding.

[7063.21s -> 7066.97s]  In the extreme odd event that I wake up tomorrow
[7066.97s -> 7068.33s]  with a hangover for some reason.
[7068.33s -> 7070.33s]  I don't, this is like, I don't think it will happen.

[7087.82s -> 7088.78s]  It's just, it's sake.
[7088.78s -> 7090.06s]  It's not that, it's not that alcoholic.
[7090.06s -> 7090.46s]  Don't worry.
[7094.39s -> 7096.23s]  I'll eat like a fucking couple pieces of bread.
[7096.23s -> 7096.71s]  I'll be fine.
[7104.54s -> 7106.06s]  24-hour movie stream.
[7107.77s -> 7108.65s]  I don't know about that.
[7111.03s -> 7111.91s]  No, I'll be fine.
[7111.91s -> 7112.47s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7112.47s -> 7112.79s]  We're good.
[7113.59s -> 7115.75s]  Expect either the movies or something else tomorrow.
[7118.39s -> 7119.75s]  Freudian Weapon gave two-fifty.

[7129.86s -> 7130.74s]  Drunk streamer.
[7132.30s -> 7135.62s]  I'll be a little, I'll be like eight percent.

[7144.07s -> 7144.79s]  That's my time.
[7145.51s -> 7147.82s]  Thank you for watching as always.
[7147.82s -> 7149.82s]  I'll see you guys probably tomorrow.

[7155.26s -> 7158.54s]  That was Unlock, a murder mystery.
[7159.10s -> 7163.06s]  It's going right into the trash.
[7165.05s -> 7165.61s]  Just kidding.
[7166.42s -> 7166.90s]  Take care.
[7167.62s -> 7169.32s]  Probably see you tomorrow.
