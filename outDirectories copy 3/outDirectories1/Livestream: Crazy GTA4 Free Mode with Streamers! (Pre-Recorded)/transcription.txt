[138.42s -> 139.78s]  Alliance, broken.

[256.46s -> 260.11s]  Oh, you're gonna bring a gun to a point... Oh, c'mon.
[260.11s -> 264.73s]  You're gonna bring a gun.
[264.73s -> 267.52s]  Alright, Burger Boy, where are you?
[267.52s -> 271.41s]  I wanna get in your car.

[273.33s -> 275.17s]  Oh, it's this dude, alright.
[275.17s -> 277.97s]  He's being chased by police.
[278.01s -> 282.24s]  Let me get in your whip.
[282.24s -> 285.92s]  No!
[285.92s -> 287.40s]  You wanna shoot out? That's what you got.
[287.40s -> 290.81s]  I'm taking your car, too.
[290.81s -> 294.91s]  I'm taking this thing to a dealer and I'm selling it.
[294.91s -> 295.79s]  Oh god, there he is.
[295.79s -> 301.00s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[301.00s -> 303.08s]  I want everybody...

[306.40s -> 307.60s]  So everybody come to me on the map.
[307.60s -> 308.92s]  My car is very destroyed right now.
[308.92s -> 310.48s]  Everybody come to me on the map.
[310.48s -> 311.96s]  My car doesn't have any doors on it.
[311.96s -> 314.65s]  Look at my car.
[314.65s -> 316.84s]  Nobody kill each other.
[316.84s -> 320.12s]  Everybody come to where me and MLC City are right now.
[320.12s -> 321.56s]  The brown blip and the...
[321.56s -> 323.47s]  What color am I?
[323.47s -> 325.12s]  I'm orange, I think.
[325.12s -> 326.80s]  Ah, this cop wants me dead.
[326.80s -> 327.56s]  I'm gonna let him kill me.
[327.56s -> 328.24s]  I have no health.
[328.24s -> 329.52s]  If you guys come to the blip,
[329.52s -> 332.72s]  I wanna try something.
[332.72s -> 337.20s]  I wanna see if we can make something weird happen right now.
[337.20s -> 338.04s]  Will you just kill me or what?
[338.04s -> 339.60s]  Is that cop shooting at me?
[339.60s -> 340.48s]  Oh, he is.
[340.48s -> 342.00s]  What?
[342.00s -> 344.24s]  Did he just kill me?
[344.24s -> 346.98s]  Did you just back into me or did that cop shoot me in the face?
[346.98s -> 348.40s]  He shot you in the face.
[348.40s -> 349.12s]  Alright, you know what?
[349.12s -> 350.31s]  Screw this.
[350.31s -> 351.19s]  Screw this, I don't know.
[351.19s -> 353.34s]  Look at my statue.
[353.34s -> 354.95s]  What's it look like?
[354.95s -> 357.00s]  Is that like a bow?
[357.00s -> 357.80s]  What the?
[357.80s -> 358.36s]  Alright, follow me.
[358.36s -> 360.60s]  We're going to get a helicopter.
[360.60s -> 361.76s]  Did you just punch me in the face?
[361.76s -> 363.00s]  I did, but I was accidental.
[363.00s -> 364.18s]  I didn't mean to.
[364.18s -> 364.90s]  Alright, let's go.
[364.90s -> 365.74s]  We gotta get a helicopter.
[365.74s -> 367.50s]  Hold on.
[367.50s -> 368.66s]  Look at all these people.
[368.66s -> 371.19s]  Look at this war going on right here.
[371.19s -> 372.51s]  Where is Burger Boy in all this?
[372.51s -> 373.95s]  Let's go get a helicopter.
[373.95s -> 379.34s]  These cops are doing a horrible job at regulating the laws.
[379.34s -> 380.30s]  Okay, we gotta spawn.
[380.30s -> 381.64s]  We got a spawner.
[381.64s -> 382.68s]  Don't kill us.
[382.68s -> 383.20s]  Oh yeah, alright.
[383.20s -> 383.84s]  He's not gonna kill us.
[383.84s -> 384.72s]  Alright, come with us.
[384.72s -> 386.96s]  I get so afraid whenever there's a person in front of us.
[386.96s -> 388.93s]  Please don't shoot us.
[388.93s -> 390.93s]  Alright, put your parachute on, everyone.
[390.93s -> 392.99s]  Yeah, make sure you get your parachutes on.
[392.99s -> 394.39s]  I love how this just...
[394.39s -> 397.51s]  There is something going on, like a hundred feet away from us.
[397.51s -> 399.07s]  People are just slaughtering each other.
[399.07s -> 401.71s]  And I feel like it has something to do with Burger Boy.
[401.71s -> 403.72s]  Oh, we need a car.
[403.72s -> 406.72s]  We're all just running with parachutes.
[406.72s -> 407.44s]  Oh, hey cop.
[407.44s -> 409.28s]  Ooh, get in this thing.
[409.28s -> 411.02s]  It only has two seats, I think.
[411.02s -> 411.58s]  It's alright though.
[411.58s -> 412.78s]  Oh my gosh, crazy lady.
[412.78s -> 413.70s]  What just happened to you?
[413.70s -> 420.75s]  Look, this guy is out of his mind.
[420.75s -> 422.56s]  I'm outta here.
[422.56s -> 424.76s]  That guy's out of his mind.
[424.76s -> 426.65s]  That guy's out of his mind.
[426.65s -> 429.41s]  That guy hissing is like just killing people left and right.
[429.49s -> 430.49s]  I'm running away.
[430.49s -> 431.49s]  Oh, on our team?
[431.49s -> 432.49s]  Or not team?
[432.49s -> 436.17s]  I just saw him like putting out everybody that was in a driver's seat in a car that
[436.17s -> 438.56s]  was next to us.
[438.56s -> 440.00s]  I'm going to get a helicopter.
[440.00s -> 441.56s]  Oh my god, this thing handles like...
[441.56s -> 442.56s]  Where are you driving?
[442.56s -> 444.63s]  I...
[444.63s -> 445.63s]  I have it on my GPS.
[445.63s -> 451.54s]  I just bought my GPS from Walgreens.
[451.54s -> 452.54s]  I have cops on me?
[452.54s -> 454.10s]  No, I don't.
[454.10s -> 455.92s]  I guess I do.
[455.92s -> 459.01s]  Alright.
[459.01s -> 460.01s]  Look at this.
[460.01s -> 461.17s]  Look at these people just killing each other.
[461.17s -> 463.53s]  I'm going to get a helicopter and then it's going to be game over.
[463.53s -> 467.06s]  Again, I'm going way too fast.
[467.06s -> 468.82s]  This always ends very badly.
[468.82s -> 470.90s]  Anytime I go this fast, it never ends well.
[470.90s -> 472.25s]  Ever.
[472.25s -> 474.53s]  You never like find like a nice safe jump to go off of.
[474.53s -> 475.53s]  Oh, here we go.
[475.53s -> 476.53s]  Out of control.
[476.53s -> 481.68s]  Out of control.
[481.68s -> 482.68s]  Why did I do that?
[482.68s -> 484.11s]  There was no reason to do that.
[484.11s -> 485.80s]  I'm okay.
[485.80s -> 487.16s]  The cops are still behind me.
[487.16s -> 491.76s]  Dude, I felt like I was just on a bike.
[491.76s -> 496.12s]  Alright, I gotta add this guy so we can get in.
[496.12s -> 497.12s]  Jacob Watson.
[497.12s -> 498.48s]  Absolutely.
[498.48s -> 499.66s]  Come on in, man.
[499.66s -> 501.35s]  Come on in the game.
[501.35s -> 502.72s]  Oh, my god.
[502.72s -> 503.72s]  Oh my god.
[503.72s -> 505.13s]  No!
[505.13s -> 506.13s]  Get away from me!
[506.13s -> 507.31s]  Oh.
[507.31s -> 511.48s]  Oh.
[511.48s -> 512.48s]  Oh, Jacob's in.
[512.48s -> 519.09s]  Is he?
[519.93s -> 522.96s]  Who is singing right now?
[522.96s -> 527.85s]  Who is singing?
[527.85s -> 528.85s]  Wait.
[528.85s -> 531.69s]  What is that?
[531.69s -> 532.69s]  How come there's like people talking?
[532.69s -> 533.69s]  Oh my gosh.
[533.69s -> 534.69s]  Alright, let's go.
[534.69s -> 535.93s]  Burger Boy, get in.
[535.93s -> 536.93s]  Oh, it's Burger Boy.
[536.93s -> 537.93s]  Burger Boy, get in.
[537.93s -> 538.93s]  Quick.
[538.93s -> 539.93s]  Alright.
[539.93s -> 541.17s]  Is that cop just shot one of us?
[541.17s -> 542.17s]  Okay, which way are we going?
[542.17s -> 543.17s]  We're going to get a helicopter.
[543.17s -> 546.48s]  Is it off this cliff right here?
[546.48s -> 547.48s]  Okay.
[547.48s -> 549.04s]  Alright.
[549.04s -> 550.66s]  I'll be the navigator.
[550.66s -> 551.66s]  Go straight.
[551.66s -> 553.66s]  Go straight until you can't go straight anymore.
[553.66s -> 560.48s]  Burger Boy, I love how you were in an ambulance just like driving a hundred miles per hour.
[562.27s -> 563.27s]  One of our tires is blown.
[563.27s -> 566.11s]  It's going to end very poorly.
[566.11s -> 567.11s]  Alright.
[567.11s -> 568.11s]  Don't like drive us into a cliff.
[568.11s -> 570.37s]  There we go.
[570.37s -> 572.44s]  Why did you get out?
[572.44s -> 573.44s]  They're so far away.
[573.44s -> 574.68s]  Alright, so still.
[574.68s -> 575.68s]  Ready at the count of three?
[575.68s -> 576.68s]  I know where we're going.
[576.68s -> 577.92s]  We're going to...
[577.92s -> 578.92s]  Oh, you know where we're going.
[578.92s -> 579.92s]  You're taking us to like the...
[579.92s -> 580.92s]  What just happened?
[580.92s -> 581.92s]  I love how I'm in the back.
[581.92s -> 582.92s]  I'm your chauffeur.
[582.92s -> 584.10s]  Alright.
[584.10s -> 586.11s]  Just take...
[586.11s -> 587.11s]  I'm getting out.
[587.11s -> 589.37s]  I'm getting out.
[589.37s -> 590.37s]  I don't trust you.
[590.37s -> 591.55s]  No.
[591.55s -> 592.55s]  What?
[592.55s -> 593.55s]  I don't trust you.
[593.55s -> 594.55s]  No, no.
[594.55s -> 595.55s]  Get in.
[595.55s -> 596.92s]  I thought you were just going to drive off the edge.
[596.92s -> 597.92s]  Alright.
[600.21s -> 601.21s]  Alright.
[601.21s -> 602.21s]  Okay.
[602.21s -> 606.46s]  Go.
[606.46s -> 607.46s]  I don't even have like my headphones plugged in.
[607.46s -> 608.46s]  People...
[608.46s -> 609.89s]  You guys are probably like...
[609.89s -> 610.89s]  Oh my...
[610.89s -> 612.52s]  What?
[612.52s -> 615.04s]  What?
[615.04s -> 616.04s]  Oh my god.
[616.04s -> 617.04s]  Oh my god.
[617.04s -> 619.04s]  It's hissing gems.
[619.04s -> 620.41s]  Get them.
[620.41s -> 621.41s]  Get them.
[621.41s -> 622.41s]  What an intense shootout this is.
[622.41s -> 623.41s]  No!
[623.41s -> 624.41s]  That guy is not having a good day today.
[624.41s -> 625.41s]  He just wants...
[625.41s -> 626.41s]  Everyone's shooting each other.
[626.41s -> 627.41s]  I got to plug my headphones in.
[627.41s -> 630.38s]  Because I think I might be reverbing.
[630.38s -> 635.40s]  Because I was just too excited to play.
[635.40s -> 636.40s]  Where are my headphones?
[636.40s -> 638.21s]  I got to find them.
[638.21s -> 639.21s]  Everyone just wants everyone dead.
[639.45s -> 646.96s]  I think about it every night and day.
[646.96s -> 648.96s]  Bring my wings and fly away.
[648.96s -> 651.20s]  I believe I can soar.
[651.20s -> 656.71s]  I see you running through that open door.
[656.71s -> 657.71s]  Oh god.
[657.71s -> 659.20s]  Did I crash?
[659.20s -> 660.20s]  Oh no!
[660.20s -> 661.20s]  I crashed!
[661.20s -> 662.96s]  No I didn't.
[662.96s -> 663.96s]  No I didn't.
[663.96s -> 666.22s]  I'm good.
[666.22s -> 669.51s]  I'm here.
[669.51s -> 670.51s]  I thought I crashed.
[670.51s -> 674.10s]  But I'm good.
[674.10s -> 675.10s]  Oh I got to get my headphones on.
[675.10s -> 676.10s]  Alright.
[676.10s -> 677.10s]  We're good to go.
[677.10s -> 678.10s]  We're good to go.
[678.10s -> 683.61s]  So everyone's in the airport.
[683.61s -> 684.61s]  Now it's pretty much just a race to who gets the helicopters.
[684.61s -> 685.61s]  Sorry.
[685.61s -> 687.56s]  I'm sorry.
[687.80s -> 689.29s]  Operation Dodge.
[689.29s -> 690.29s]  Oh give me this P90.
[690.29s -> 691.60s]  Oh man.
[691.60s -> 699.04s]  It is a sad day for anybody coming close to me.
[699.04s -> 702.07s]  Alright.
[702.07s -> 703.37s]  I'm safe.
[703.37s -> 704.37s]  You know what?
[704.37s -> 706.19s]  I got to get a car.
[706.19s -> 707.19s]  I got to get a cup.
[707.19s -> 708.19s]  Hey.
[708.19s -> 710.07s]  How you doing?
[710.07s -> 711.07s]  Please don't kill me.
[711.07s -> 713.01s]  Okay.
[713.01s -> 714.01s]  He ran by me.
[714.01s -> 715.01s]  Good.
[715.01s -> 716.01s]  Hey.
[716.01s -> 717.65s]  This guy's idea of fun is getting inside the helicopter and shooting all the other helicopters
[717.65s -> 718.65s]  so nobody else can get in.
[718.65s -> 720.93s]  Oh you piece of crap.
[720.93s -> 722.62s]  Alright.
[722.62s -> 727.40s]  Operation take out the guy in the helicopter.
[727.40s -> 730.08s]  Operation take out helicopter flyer.
[730.92s -> 732.77s]  Operation rocket launcher and dispose of.
[732.77s -> 733.77s]  I got in the helicopter.
[733.77s -> 738.85s]  I'm going to get over there.
[738.85s -> 740.16s]  I'm on my way.
[740.16s -> 743.38s]  I'm en route.
[743.38s -> 745.84s]  Break that window.
[745.84s -> 748.44s]  Oh this brings back memories when I smashed my face on that guy.
[748.44s -> 749.81s]  He's not even moving.
[749.81s -> 751.12s]  What is that guy doing?
[751.12s -> 754.47s]  Wait.
[754.47s -> 756.03s]  What?
[756.03s -> 757.03s]  Where am I going?
[757.03s -> 758.03s]  Aren't the helicopters...
[758.03s -> 761.57s]  Oh they're right there.
[761.57s -> 762.57s]  They're right there.
[762.57s -> 763.57s]  Sorry for the...
[763.57s -> 765.58s]  It's a good tactic man.
[765.58s -> 766.58s]  That's alright.
[766.58s -> 768.52s]  Alright.
[768.52s -> 769.96s]  Who thinks I'm going to make it underneath this plane?
[769.96s -> 774.33s]  I do.
[774.33s -> 775.33s]  Woo hoo.
[775.33s -> 779.39s]  Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me a helicopter.
[779.39s -> 781.52s]  Please don't die.
[781.52s -> 783.52s]  I am so addicted to...
[783.64s -> 785.08s]  Oh my god.
[785.08s -> 786.08s]  Oh my god.
[786.08s -> 787.08s]  Oh my god.
[787.08s -> 788.08s]  Oh my god.
[788.08s -> 789.08s]  Oh my god.
[789.08s -> 790.64s]  Oh my god.
[790.64s -> 792.77s]  I need to crouch.
[792.77s -> 795.23s]  How do I crouch?
[795.23s -> 796.23s]  Oh my god.
[796.23s -> 797.92s]  What a psycho.
[797.92s -> 798.92s]  What a psycho.
[798.92s -> 801.24s]  What is he doing?
[801.24s -> 802.87s]  What are you doing?
[802.87s -> 804.49s]  My helicopter.
[804.49s -> 805.49s]  What is happening to it?
[805.49s -> 806.49s]  Why can't it just stay flying?
[806.49s -> 807.49s]  What the...
[807.49s -> 809.69s]  Are you in a helicopter?
[809.69s -> 810.69s]  Where are you?
[810.69s -> 813.79s]  Hey dude.
[813.79s -> 814.79s]  Stop crouching.
[814.79s -> 815.79s]  Run.
[815.79s -> 816.79s]  All these helicopters are destroyed.
[816.79s -> 821.29s]  Oh dear god.
[821.29s -> 822.29s]  This is bad.
[822.29s -> 823.66s]  This is so bad.
[823.66s -> 825.09s]  I'm going to die the second I get into this.
[825.09s -> 826.65s]  Oh run away.
[826.65s -> 827.65s]  I'm not even going to go in that dude.
[827.65s -> 828.65s]  I'm going to die the second I get in there.
[828.65s -> 830.72s]  Oh my god.
[830.72s -> 831.72s]  I'm still alive.
[831.72s -> 833.09s]  It's my chance.
[833.09s -> 834.09s]  It's my chance.
[834.09s -> 835.09s]  Get in.
[835.09s -> 836.09s]  Get in.
[836.09s -> 839.12s]  Get in.
[839.12s -> 840.12s]  Get in.
[840.12s -> 841.12s]  Go.
[841.12s -> 842.43s]  Go you slug.
[842.43s -> 843.67s]  Oh yeah.
[843.67s -> 845.10s]  It's time for copter wars.
[845.10s -> 846.10s]  Oh my god.
[846.10s -> 847.10s]  No.
[847.10s -> 848.47s]  No.
[848.47s -> 849.47s]  No.
[849.47s -> 851.16s]  Get up.
[851.16s -> 852.16s]  Oh that was...
[852.16s -> 858.00s]  I just really had a heart attack.
[858.00s -> 859.00s]  Those helicopters suck.
[859.00s -> 860.69s]  Oh my god.
[860.69s -> 861.69s]  Oh my god.
[861.69s -> 862.69s]  Oh my god.
[862.69s -> 864.32s]  Oh my god.
[865.94s -> 867.94s]  Those helicopters suck for being a helicopter.
[867.94s -> 868.94s]  Alright I'm good.
[868.94s -> 870.69s]  This just sucks.
[870.69s -> 872.64s]  I'm good.
[872.64s -> 873.64s]  I'm alright.
[873.64s -> 874.64s]  Yeah what's going on?
[874.64s -> 876.26s]  I feel like I'm driving a...
[876.26s -> 878.38s]  Alright let me aim it down to the ground.
[878.38s -> 881.06s]  Any unsuspecting people I can smash into?
[881.06s -> 884.90s]  There's cops down there.
[884.90s -> 885.90s]  Barrage.
[885.90s -> 887.52s]  Unleash the fury.
[887.52s -> 888.76s]  Ah.
[888.76s -> 891.84s]  I'm not killing anybody.
[891.84s -> 893.14s]  You know what?
[893.14s -> 894.14s]  I'm going kamikaze.
[894.14s -> 895.64s]  Oh my god.
[895.64s -> 901.32s]  Whoever this pink dot is.
[901.32s -> 903.32s]  You picked a bad day to be a pink dot.
[903.32s -> 905.32s]  You picked a bad day to be a pink...
[905.32s -> 906.32s]  Oh I'm going to throw up dude.
[906.32s -> 907.32s]  Really.
[907.32s -> 909.94s]  I'm really going to puke.
[909.94s -> 914.01s]  Did like the controls change or is this lag?
[914.01s -> 915.38s]  Oh no.
[915.38s -> 917.32s]  How did I...
[917.32s -> 918.32s]  But I'm like 4 but flying is...
[918.32s -> 928.14s]  Well that's how we get out of a helicopter and walk off the front and...
[928.14s -> 930.76s]  Hey come pick me up.
[930.76s -> 932.84s]  Alright.
[932.84s -> 933.84s]  Oh my god.
[933.84s -> 937.97s]  I think papa got a brand new bag here.
[937.97s -> 944.84s]  No.
[944.84s -> 950.41s]  I'm such a bad shot.
[950.41s -> 953.10s]  I was like landing.
[953.10s -> 955.34s]  Oh you were trying to pick me up?
[955.34s -> 957.35s]  Oh I'm sorry.
[957.35s -> 958.35s]  I thought you were like...
[958.35s -> 959.35s]  You were shooting missiles at me.
[959.35s -> 960.35s]  I was scared.
[960.35s -> 961.35s]  Because you shot a rocket at me.
[961.35s -> 967.00s]  Alright.
[967.00s -> 968.00s]  I'm conserving the rest of this ammo.
[968.00s -> 969.37s]  Let's get out of here.
[969.37s -> 971.37s]  We're like being shot at to death.
[971.37s -> 976.08s]  If that killed me I was going to be so angry.
[976.08s -> 980.08s]  Everyone just spawns and pulls out pistols and you just start shooting each other.
[980.08s -> 983.60s]  This is so like unorganized.
[983.60s -> 986.16s]  I'm going to kill this guy.
[986.16s -> 988.30s]  Oh no.
[988.30s -> 989.30s]  Get him.
[989.30s -> 990.30s]  Get him.
[990.30s -> 996.49s]  Oh I could have sworn.
[996.49s -> 999.49s]  Do I blame Tom Brady or anybody for Wes Welker?
[999.49s -> 1001.42s]  No.
[1001.42s -> 1003.42s]  I mean the Patriots didn't really have that.
[1003.42s -> 1006.92s]  It was a pretty much string of luck that they got into the playoffs to begin with.
[1006.92s -> 1010.69s]  Good to see them get that far.
[1010.69s -> 1011.69s]  But yeah go Celtics.
[1011.69s -> 1012.69s]  That's all I got to say.
[1012.69s -> 1017.07s]  Alright where's Burger Boy?
[1017.07s -> 1021.40s]  Burger Boy is the number one target for me.
[1021.40s -> 1022.40s]  I think he is...
[1022.40s -> 1023.40s]  No you're brown.
[1023.40s -> 1024.70s]  You're brown.
[1024.70s -> 1026.52s]  He's green.
[1026.52s -> 1029.16s]  You're orange.
[1029.16s -> 1032.98s]  Alright so stream Burger Boy is target number one.
[1032.98s -> 1034.98s]  Look at how mad he is.
[1034.98s -> 1035.98s]  Look at how mad he is.
[1035.98s -> 1037.22s]  I want the whole stream.
[1037.22s -> 1039.22s]  Let's see if we can make him rage quit.
[1039.22s -> 1040.97s]  You guys suck.
[1040.97s -> 1047.05s]  For some reason I want to save Cordobomb.
[1047.05s -> 1048.05s]  Get in.
[1048.05s -> 1049.05s]  Get in Burger Boy.
[1049.05s -> 1051.23s]  We're making it out of here alive.
[1051.23s -> 1054.07s]  Get in Cordobomb.
[1054.07s -> 1056.88s]  Me and Burger Boy are going to escape.
[1056.88s -> 1059.25s]  I actually you know Burger Boy.
[1059.25s -> 1062.80s]  Oh no.
[1062.80s -> 1063.80s]  Oh no.
[1063.80s -> 1064.80s]  Oh I got the P90 man.
[1064.80s -> 1066.36s]  How is he?
[1066.36s -> 1069.04s]  I just unloaded 70 bullets into that guy.
[1069.04s -> 1070.41s]  What a champion.
[1070.41s -> 1072.72s]  So are we still having a war against Burger Boy?
[1072.72s -> 1073.72s]  It doesn't seem like that.
[1073.72s -> 1075.72s]  I'm trying to get in a helicopter.
[1075.72s -> 1078.21s]  I say we I mean you guys.
[1078.21s -> 1081.52s]  Oh my god.
[1081.52s -> 1082.52s]  Stay with it.
[1082.52s -> 1084.33s]  What was that?
[1084.33s -> 1086.85s]  What on earth was that?
[1086.85s -> 1087.85s]  That was ridiculous.
[1087.85s -> 1088.85s]  Was that a rocket?
[1088.85s -> 1090.73s]  Holy crap.
[1090.73s -> 1097.00s]  Oh no I want to live.
[1097.00s -> 1098.24s]  I want to live.
[1098.24s -> 1102.55s]  Get me on like the Italian scooter.
[1102.55s -> 1104.79s]  Sick drivings.
[1104.79s -> 1106.80s]  Oh here we go.
[1106.80s -> 1107.80s]  Get me on this bike.
[1107.80s -> 1109.80s]  Burger Boy you want to get in some helicopters?
[1109.80s -> 1112.57s]  God ball.
[1112.57s -> 1114.90s]  Oh no.
[1114.90s -> 1117.90s]  The stream is counting my deaths.
[1117.90s -> 1119.59s]  I'm up to 11.
[1119.59s -> 1121.47s]  Where'd you go?
[1121.47s -> 1124.31s]  Where are you?
[1124.31s -> 1128.17s]  Try Burger Boy.
[1128.17s -> 1129.17s]  Hey get on this bike.
[1129.17s -> 1132.56s]  That's a place I don't want to be at.
[1132.56s -> 1135.38s]  Let me get in with you Burger.
[1135.38s -> 1138.26s]  Hey wait I would enjoy the fun too.
[1138.26s -> 1140.27s]  There's another helicopter.
[1140.27s -> 1141.27s]  You can't get in.
[1141.27s -> 1143.27s]  I'm trying to hit my head on the blades.
[1143.27s -> 1146.71s]  Oh hey let me just get in this helicopter.
[1146.71s -> 1148.71s]  Like hit my face on the blades.
[1148.71s -> 1150.71s]  Just go go go go go go go go.
[1150.71s -> 1151.71s]  Go without me.
[1151.71s -> 1152.71s]  We got a boat.
[1152.71s -> 1153.71s]  Oh my god.
[1153.71s -> 1156.08s]  I'm getting out of this.
[1156.08s -> 1161.88s]  Burger Boy that's going to blow up.
[1161.88s -> 1162.88s]  That's going to blow up.
[1162.88s -> 1164.88s]  What are you doing still driving?
[1166.44s -> 1172.64s]  RPG watch out.
[1172.64s -> 1187.09s]  That was so perfect.
[1187.09s -> 1191.78s]  Oh my god thank god this is being recorded.
[1191.78s -> 1197.15s]  Because if I didn't get that on tape I would have been so bad at myself.
[1197.15s -> 1200.39s]  Look how destroyed he just got.
[1200.39s -> 1207.34s]  He was like trying so hard to stay alive.
[1207.34s -> 1209.34s]  And he just died.
[1209.34s -> 1212.96s]  You can see like the intensity in his like jump out.
[1212.96s -> 1216.29s]  Hold on Burger Boy.
[1216.29s -> 1217.29s]  Oh my face.
[1217.29s -> 1219.29s]  Hey let me get in that car with you Burger Boy.
[1219.29s -> 1222.30s]  Alright Jacob let me get on the back of that scooter.
[1222.30s -> 1225.05s]  Oh you bastard.
[1225.05s -> 1228.64s]  I was trying to get on the back.
[1228.64s -> 1235.36s]  Everybody that got to see that.
[1235.36s -> 1237.36s]  That was one of the funniest things I've seen.
[1237.36s -> 1238.85s]  Alright let's go.
[1238.85s -> 1239.85s]  Oh wait.

[1246.05s -> 1249.60s]  Alright who's...
[1249.60s -> 1250.60s]  Oh the cop's on you.
[1250.60s -> 1252.41s]  Okay.
[1252.41s -> 1254.55s]  Let's go back to the airfield.
[1254.55s -> 1255.55s]  Oh man.
[1255.55s -> 1257.36s]  Look at this guy.
[1257.36s -> 1259.36s]  That guy just got robbed by a cop.
[1259.36s -> 1261.60s]  We almost sandwiched that dude.
[1268.88s -> 1275.46s]  Let's move.
[1275.46s -> 1277.46s]  Alright let's get in this helicopter.
[1277.46s -> 1280.72s]  Oh look at that perfect pull up.
[1280.72s -> 1286.33s]  I got a feeling this guy might turn into a traitor.

[1433.85s -> 1435.67s]  Everyone really likes shooting.
[1435.67s -> 1438.67s]  Nobody just wants to run cars into each other.
[1439.67s -> 1442.70s]  Where are these helicopters?
[1442.70s -> 1445.03s]  I'm taking cover behind.
[1445.03s -> 1448.03s]  I know someone's going to come and just smash into us.

[1471.03s -> 1472.03s]  You know what?
[1472.03s -> 1473.03s]  I'm going this way.
[1473.03s -> 1474.03s]  There's police helicopters here.

[1551.02s -> 1561.16s]  next to me.
[1561.16s -> 1563.61s]  Okay.

[1564.61s -> 1565.98s]  I'm just like creeping.
[1565.98s -> 1568.88s]  Now I'm waiting for a copter.
[1568.88s -> 1569.88s]  I'm waiting for a helicopter.
[1569.88s -> 1573.60s]  There's no way I'm going to get it.
[1573.60s -> 1574.60s]  Oh my god.
[1574.60s -> 1577.80s]  Alright I'm getting in.

[1583.42s -> 1584.42s]  Look at how many police are here.
[1584.42s -> 1585.42s]  Look at the mini map.
[1585.42s -> 1586.66s]  Look at the mini map.
[1586.66s -> 1587.96s]  That's ridiculous.
[1587.96s -> 1589.59s]  There's a lot of them.
[1589.59s -> 1590.59s]  Oh I just barely.

[1600.70s -> 1604.31s]  Plan B is to go get the helicopter.
[1604.31s -> 1606.74s]  Oh here comes the SWAT team.
[1606.74s -> 1607.74s]  Good thing they're not coming after me.
[1607.74s -> 1609.56s]  How tall.
[1609.56s -> 1611.44s]  Somebody's already doing plan B.
[1611.44s -> 1613.68s]  Somebody's already doing plan B.
[1613.68s -> 1614.85s]  What did he say it was?
[1614.85s -> 1619.93s]  To go base jump and go float over here.
[1619.93s -> 1621.36s]  Who is this?
[1621.36s -> 1622.36s]  Is nobody even in here?
[1622.36s -> 1625.14s]  I'm taking this.
[1625.14s -> 1626.57s]  Give me that.
[1626.57s -> 1627.57s]  Give it to me.
[1627.57s -> 1629.58s]  Get out of there.
[1629.58s -> 1631.14s]  Oh man that was bad.
[1631.14s -> 1633.14s]  I'm sorry Mr. Ambulance Driver.
[1633.14s -> 1634.14s]  You just try to help people.
[1634.14s -> 1635.14s]  I'm such a bad person.
[1635.14s -> 1637.98s]  I'm sorry.
[1637.98s -> 1641.65s]  Alright turn that off.
[1641.65s -> 1642.65s]  That's going to get annoying.
[1642.65s -> 1644.53s]  Alright let's see.
[1644.53s -> 1647.09s]  I need to go right here.
[1647.09s -> 1649.48s]  Why am I flipped over?
[1649.48s -> 1650.66s]  I just rammed you.
[1650.66s -> 1651.66s]  What?
[1651.66s -> 1652.66s]  You're on fire.
[1652.66s -> 1653.66s]  Oh my god you're on fire.
[1653.66s -> 1654.66s]  You're on fire.
[1654.66s -> 1656.09s]  You're on fire.
[1656.09s -> 1657.09s]  No.
[1657.09s -> 1658.97s]  Get away from that car.
[1658.97s -> 1660.53s]  Give me this one.
[1660.53s -> 1663.44s]  No.
[1663.44s -> 1664.44s]  Give me this.
[1664.44s -> 1665.44s]  Alright.

[1668.00s -> 1669.62s]  Come here.
[1669.62s -> 1671.44s]  Come here.
[1671.44s -> 1674.34s]  This dude's lagging.
[1674.34s -> 1675.64s]  I got away.
[1675.64s -> 1676.64s]  Alright.
[1676.64s -> 1677.64s]  Let's see if the plan works.
[1677.64s -> 1679.91s]  Come pick me up.

[1685.07s -> 1687.20s]  I wasn't going to run into you.
[1687.20s -> 1688.70s]  I promise.
[1688.70s -> 1689.70s]  I'm in the back seat.
[1689.70s -> 1690.70s]  Alright.

[1693.35s -> 1694.35s]  Driving Miss Stealth.
[1694.35s -> 1698.02s]  Hopefully this building is tall enough so we can base jump off of it and fly into the
[1698.02s -> 1700.92s]  action.
[1700.92s -> 1703.29s]  That's a right hand.
[1703.29s -> 1705.01s]  Oh jeez.
[1705.01s -> 1707.35s]  Please exit the vehicle and watch your hands and feet.
[1707.35s -> 1709.83s]  Thank you for riding in German the worst car driver in the world.
[1709.83s -> 1712.48s]  Thank you so much.

[1724.73s -> 1725.73s]  Alright.
[1725.73s -> 1728.76s]  We're going to get a new car.
[1728.76s -> 1732.63s]  We need a new car.
[1732.63s -> 1733.63s]  Somebody's already doing the parachute.
[1733.63s -> 1734.63s]  Where are the cars?
[1734.63s -> 1735.87s]  I found a motorcycle.
[1735.87s -> 1738.71s]  Oh jeez.
[1738.71s -> 1742.12s]  Is this the guy?

[1756.21s -> 1759.44s]  Kill him.
[1759.68s -> 1760.85s]  Alright.
[1760.85s -> 1763.63s]  I'm right there.
[1763.63s -> 1764.63s]  We're right here.
[1764.63s -> 1765.63s]  Oh here's the guy that was shooting us.
[1765.63s -> 1766.63s]  Let's back into him.
[1766.63s -> 1768.38s]  Argh.
[1768.38s -> 1769.38s]  Argh.
[1769.38s -> 1775.61s]  I will run you over as many times as I have to.
[1775.61s -> 1777.88s]  Hahaha.

[1782.20s -> 1783.20s]  I'm going to do that base jump.
[1783.20s -> 1787.90s]  It's going to happen.
[1787.90s -> 1789.65s]  Corner.
[1789.65s -> 1792.04s]  Here we go.
[1792.04s -> 1793.04s]  Oh this is a really small building.
[1793.04s -> 1794.99s]  This is going to...
[1794.99s -> 1795.99s]  Is there a taxi I can call?
[1795.99s -> 1797.16s]  Actually that's not that small.
[1797.16s -> 1799.40s]  I don't think they have taxis in...
[1799.40s -> 1800.71s]  Aww.
[1800.71s -> 1802.20s]  Dude.
[1802.20s -> 1803.76s]  Hurry hurry hurry.
[1803.76s -> 1805.84s]  Alright.
[1805.84s -> 1806.84s]  How high up am I?
[1807.08s -> 1809.28s]  Pretty damn high.
[1809.28s -> 1810.28s]  Alright.
[1810.28s -> 1812.09s]  Where's the action going on?
[1812.09s -> 1813.72s]  Over here.
[1813.72s -> 1814.72s]  So I've got to jump off this side.
[1814.72s -> 1816.53s]  And...
[1816.53s -> 1817.53s]  Let's go.
[1817.53s -> 1819.67s]  Open.
[1819.67s -> 1822.70s]  Open.
[1822.70s -> 1823.70s]  Alright.
[1823.70s -> 1825.32s]  Let's see if I can like...
[1825.32s -> 1826.32s]  Float into the madness.
[1826.32s -> 1827.32s]  That guy's a helicopter.
[1827.32s -> 1829.78s]  Float on the helicopter, boy.
[1829.78s -> 1830.78s]  Woohoo.
[1830.78s -> 1831.78s]  I'm sure that'll be pretty easy.
[1831.78s -> 1833.34s]  Ah.
[1833.34s -> 1836.99s]  Look at how relaxing this is.
[1836.99s -> 1838.99s]  Just floating around.
[1838.99s -> 1839.99s]  Relaxing with my friends.
[1839.99s -> 1842.70s]  Oh hey stealth.
[1842.70s -> 1843.94s]  I made it.
[1843.94s -> 1845.82s]  That was fun.
[1845.82s -> 1846.82s]  Woohoo.
[1846.82s -> 1850.58s]  Let's go do that again.
[1850.58s -> 1851.58s]  Except this time.
[1851.82s -> 1853.12s]  I want to get on this.
[1853.12s -> 1854.12s]  I want to get on the bike.
[1854.12s -> 1857.03s]  I want to get on the bike.
[1857.03s -> 1858.03s]  I...
[1858.03s -> 1859.03s]  I'm trying to...
[1859.03s -> 1860.03s]  I just flew.
[1860.03s -> 1861.27s]  What?
[1861.27s -> 1862.27s]  These are right next to me.
[1862.27s -> 1863.27s]  What?
[1863.27s -> 1866.68s]  This guy got...
[1866.68s -> 1867.68s]  This guy...
[1867.68s -> 1870.28s]  He was still in the riding position.
[1870.28s -> 1873.36s]  He jumped up and he was like, oh nothing's going on here, I'm just like still riding
[1873.36s -> 1875.82s]  the bike.
[1875.82s -> 1876.82s]  What the hell was that?
[1876.82s -> 1883.35s]  Oh I love how many glitches are in this game.
[1883.35s -> 1884.52s]  Oh jeez.
[1884.52s -> 1885.52s]  Oh my god.
[1885.52s -> 1886.52s]  I can't control it.
[1886.52s -> 1889.40s]  Who wants to play baseball?
[1889.40s -> 1892.34s]  We've got enough people to play baseball.
[1892.34s -> 1893.34s]  We've got like...
[1893.78s -> 1894.78s]  There's enough people in here.
[1894.78s -> 1896.28s]  Alright, I'm going to be the pitcher.
[1896.28s -> 1898.28s]  I'll be the batter.
[1898.28s -> 1900.61s]  Let's play grenade baseball.
[1900.61s -> 1906.09s]  Do we have any grenades?
[1906.09s -> 1907.09s]  I'm the batter.
[1907.09s -> 1908.09s]  Alright, ready?
[1908.09s -> 1909.33s]  Ready.
[1909.33s -> 1910.33s]  So I'm going to throw the ball.
[1910.33s -> 1912.21s]  Alright, did you hit it?
[1912.21s -> 1913.21s]  Oh I hit it.
[1913.21s -> 1914.21s]  Boom.
[1914.21s -> 1915.21s]  Oh look at...
[1915.21s -> 1916.21s]  Wow.
[1916.21s -> 1917.21s]  It went so far.
[1917.21s -> 1918.21s]  Look at how far it went.
[1918.21s -> 1919.21s]  Around first base.
[1919.21s -> 1920.21s]  Go to second.
[1920.21s -> 1921.21s]  Oh no.
[1921.21s -> 1922.77s]  I got to throw him out.
[1922.77s -> 1923.77s]  Oh I didn't get him.
[1923.77s -> 1924.77s]  Oh no.
[1924.77s -> 1925.77s]  The ball got thrown in.
[1925.77s -> 1926.77s]  Oh he's still safe.
[1926.77s -> 1928.40s]  Here you are.
[1928.40s -> 1929.40s]  You got a triple.
[1929.40s -> 1930.57s]  You got a triple.
[1931.01s -> 1932.01s]  Alright.
[1932.01s -> 1933.01s]  Ghost man on third.
[1933.01s -> 1934.01s]  Oh okay.
[1934.01s -> 1935.01s]  Wait.
[1935.01s -> 1936.25s]  No.
[1936.25s -> 1937.25s]  No.
[1937.25s -> 1938.25s]  No.
[1938.25s -> 1939.25s]  You have to leave the car.
[1939.25s -> 1940.25s]  Oh.
[1940.25s -> 1941.56s]  But it's a ghost man.
[1941.56s -> 1942.56s]  Yeah.
[1942.56s -> 1943.97s]  But then you have to get in the car and drive to home plate.
[1943.97s -> 1948.28s]  So you get over there.
[1948.28s -> 1949.28s]  So you get over...
[1949.28s -> 1952.60s]  Someone in the stream just wrote, the crowd goes wild.
[1952.60s -> 1953.97s]  Alright.
[1953.97s -> 1955.47s]  So here we go.
[1955.47s -> 1956.47s]  Ready?
[1956.47s -> 1957.64s]  I pitched it.
[1957.64s -> 1958.64s]  Alright.
[1958.64s -> 1959.95s]  Now go run to first base.
[1959.95s -> 1960.95s]  Oh.
[1960.95s -> 1962.32s]  Missed.
[1962.32s -> 1963.32s]  Oh god.
[1963.32s -> 1965.07s]  There's another guy here.
[1965.07s -> 1966.07s]  We're playing baseball, dude.
[1966.07s -> 1967.07s]  Oh it's Zeus.
[1967.83s -> 1968.83s]  Oh yeah.
[1968.83s -> 1969.83s]  We're playing baseball.
[1969.83s -> 1971.71s]  Do you want to play baseball?
[1971.71s -> 1972.71s]  Alright.
[1972.71s -> 1973.71s]  My runner got home.
[1973.71s -> 1975.08s]  I got a single.
[1975.08s -> 1976.08s]  Zeus, you're up.
[1976.08s -> 1978.98s]  Alright.
[1978.98s -> 1979.98s]  Baseball is over.
[1979.98s -> 1980.98s]  I win.
[1980.98s -> 1984.52s]  Because you didn't get home.
[1984.52s -> 1985.52s]  What's my...
[1985.52s -> 1986.52s]  What do I win?
[1986.52s -> 1988.72s]  I just shot you in the toe.
[1988.72s -> 1989.72s]  Alright.
[1989.72s -> 1991.16s]  Run home.
[1991.16s -> 1993.61s]  To your real home.
[1993.61s -> 1994.61s]  What?
[1994.61s -> 1995.61s]  Is that a Bad News Bears joke?
[1995.61s -> 1998.71s]  Alright.
[1998.71s -> 2000.40s]  Hey.
[2000.40s -> 2002.47s]  Oh.
[2002.47s -> 2005.37s]  Let's get in the tanker.
[2005.37s -> 2006.37s]  Let's get in the tanker.
[2006.37s -> 2007.37s]  Please tell me those explode.
[2007.37s -> 2008.37s]  Please tell me those.
[2008.37s -> 2009.37s]  Please tell me.
[2009.37s -> 2011.70s]  No.
[2011.70s -> 2012.70s]  No.
[2013.46s -> 2014.46s]  Don't shoot it.
[2014.46s -> 2015.46s]  Don't shoot it.
[2015.46s -> 2016.46s]  Is it connected?
[2016.46s -> 2017.46s]  No.
[2017.46s -> 2018.46s]  It's not connected.
[2018.46s -> 2019.83s]  I don't even think we can connect it.
[2019.83s -> 2020.83s]  This is on GTA San Andreas.
[2020.83s -> 2022.77s]  They definitely explode though.
[2022.77s -> 2023.77s]  For sure.
[2023.77s -> 2025.91s]  Oh.
[2025.91s -> 2027.40s]  Let's see if I can connect them.
[2027.40s -> 2028.40s]  Nah.
[2028.40s -> 2029.58s]  You can't connect them.
[2029.58s -> 2030.58s]  This is going to be a massive...
[2030.58s -> 2033.29s]  You're going to die.
[2033.29s -> 2034.29s]  You're going to die in like two seconds.
[2034.29s -> 2035.29s]  The fire is gone.
[2035.29s -> 2036.29s]  Oh my god.
[2036.29s -> 2038.11s]  Look at this.
[2038.11s -> 2039.11s]  Burger Boy to save the day.
[2039.11s -> 2040.48s]  He did...
[2040.48s -> 2042.68s]  Wow.
[2042.68s -> 2044.17s]  What a pro.
[2044.17s -> 2051.43s]  Let me get in.
[2051.43s -> 2052.43s]  No.
[2052.43s -> 2053.43s]  I want to get in this.
[2053.43s -> 2055.76s]  No.
[2055.76s -> 2056.76s]  Dude.
[2056.76s -> 2058.96s]  He just flipped.
[2059.72s -> 2062.72s]  He just flipped that car.
[2062.72s -> 2066.08s]  That's like a five million pound car.
[2066.08s -> 2068.69s]  And he just like flipped it over.
[2068.69s -> 2072.21s]  I still have my parachute, right?
[2072.21s -> 2073.21s]  I hope so.
[2073.21s -> 2079.21s]  I love how you just came out of nowhere Burger Boy.
[2079.21s -> 2083.73s]  That was like amazing.
[2083.73s -> 2088.28s]  I can't believe that thing flipped my anchor.
[2088.28s -> 2090.28s]  That's why I laughed so hard.
[2090.28s -> 2094.27s]  Oh Burger Boy.
[2094.27s -> 2095.27s]  You're going to waste all your ammo.
[2095.27s -> 2096.76s]  All right.
[2096.76s -> 2097.76s]  Ready?
[2097.76s -> 2099.13s]  Here we go.
[2099.13s -> 2100.13s]  I am going to jump out of the...
[2100.13s -> 2101.13s]  I'm going to parachute.
[2101.13s -> 2103.13s]  I'm going to parachute and see how long I can parachute.
[2104.96s -> 2105.96s]  So keep coming up.
[2105.96s -> 2110.21s]  Shoot.
[2110.21s -> 2111.21s]  Oh shoot.
[2111.21s -> 2112.71s]  All the people down there.
[2112.71s -> 2113.71s]  Wow.
[2113.71s -> 2114.71s]  We are up really high.
[2114.71s -> 2115.71s]  I think this is as high as we can go.
[2115.71s -> 2116.71s]  Thanks Burger Boy.
[2116.71s -> 2119.55s]  Woohoo.
[2119.55s -> 2121.04s]  Oh yeah.
[2121.04s -> 2122.04s]  Thanks Burger Boy.
[2122.04s -> 2123.04s]  Woohoo.
[2123.04s -> 2128.16s]  So I'm going to watch and see where Burger Boy goes.
[2128.16s -> 2130.16s]  So I'll tell you a story while I'm parachuting.
[2130.16s -> 2132.11s]  It's like story time.
[2132.11s -> 2133.11s]  So one time.
[2133.11s -> 2136.99s]  Let's see how long it takes before I can finish this story.
[2136.99s -> 2139.57s]  One time I was at Halloween.
[2139.57s -> 2142.60s]  I was having a good time as a Ninja Turtles.
[2142.60s -> 2144.00s]  And the story is really going nowhere.
[2144.16s -> 2151.94s]  I just want to try and talk and see how long it takes for me to land.
[2151.94s -> 2154.59s]  Oh more talking.
[2154.59s -> 2155.59s]  I love all these people.
[2155.59s -> 2160.16s]  I feel the same way.
[2160.16s -> 2161.16s]  I feel the same way.
[2161.16s -> 2163.87s]  Whoever was just talking in a different language.
[2163.87s -> 2164.87s]  Let's...
[2164.87s -> 2165.87s]  Woohoo.
[2165.87s -> 2167.75s]  Who is even talking?
[2167.75s -> 2179.29s]  I just heard a language I am not familiar with.
[2179.29s -> 2184.82s]  Wow.
[2184.82s -> 2185.82s]  So who thinks...
[2185.82s -> 2186.82s]  Place your bets.
[2186.82s -> 2191.24s]  Am I going to die right now?
[2191.24s -> 2193.38s]  Am I going to die right now when I land?
[2193.38s -> 2194.38s]  We'll find out.
[2194.38s -> 2195.38s]  Somebody is now chasing me.
[2195.38s -> 2197.52s]  And I have a feeling they are going to take me out.
[2197.52s -> 2198.52s]  Oh it's Bert.
[2198.52s -> 2199.52s]  It's Bert.
[2199.52s -> 2203.19s]  It's Bert.
[2203.19s -> 2204.19s]  It's Bert.
[2204.19s -> 2206.07s]  It's Bert.
[2206.07s -> 2207.07s]  It's Bert.
[2207.23s -> 2209.49s]  It's Bert.
[2209.49s -> 2210.49s]  It's Bert.
[2210.49s -> 2212.05s]  It's Bert.
[2212.05s -> 2213.05s]  It's Bert.
[2213.05s -> 2214.05s]  It's Bert.
[2214.05s -> 2215.05s]  It's Bert.
[2215.05s -> 2218.53s]  It's Bert.
[2218.53s -> 2219.53s]  It's Bert.
[2219.53s -> 2221.03s]  It's Bert.
[2221.03s -> 2222.27s]  It's Bert.
[2222.27s -> 2223.64s]  It's Bert.
[2223.64s -> 2224.64s]  It's Bert.
[2224.64s -> 2225.64s]  It's Bert.
[2225.64s -> 2227.77s]  It's Bert.
[2227.77s -> 2228.77s]  It's Bert.
[2228.77s -> 2231.23s]  It's Bert.
[2231.23s -> 2232.66s]  It's Bert.
[2232.66s -> 2233.66s]  It's Bert.
[2233.66s -> 2234.66s]  It's Bert.
[2234.66s -> 2237.31s]  It's Bert.
[2237.31s -> 2238.31s]  It's Bert.
[2238.31s -> 2241.40s]  It's Bert.
[2241.40s -> 2243.22s]  It's Bert.
[2243.22s -> 2244.22s]  It's Bert.
[2244.22s -> 2245.22s]  It's Bert.
[2245.22s -> 2246.22s]  It's Bert.
[2246.22s -> 2247.97s]  It's Bert.
[2247.97s -> 2248.97s]  It's Bert.
[2248.97s -> 2249.97s]  It's Bert.
[2249.97s -> 2250.97s]  It's Bert.
[2250.97s -> 2252.34s]  It's Bert.
[2252.34s -> 2253.77s]  It's Bert.
[2253.77s -> 2254.77s]  It's Bert.
[2254.77s -> 2255.77s]  It's Bert.
[2255.77s -> 2259.96s]  It's Bert.
[2259.96s -> 2261.84s]  It's Bert.
[2261.84s -> 2267.24s]  It's Bert.
[2267.24s -> 2268.24s]  It's Bert.
[2268.24s -> 2269.24s]  It's Bert.
[2269.24s -> 2271.69s]  It's Bert.
[2271.69s -> 2273.06s]  It's Bert.
[2273.06s -> 2278.65s]  It's Bert.
[2278.65s -> 2279.65s]  It's Bert.
[2279.65s -> 2284.41s]  It's Bert.
[2284.41s -> 2286.55s]  It's Bert.
[2286.55s -> 2288.75s]  It's Bert.
[2288.75s -> 2290.95s]  It's Bert.
[2290.95s -> 2291.95s]  It's Bert.
[2291.95s -> 2292.95s]  It's Bert.
[2292.95s -> 2294.57s]  It's Bert.
[2294.57s -> 2296.26s]  It's Bert.
[2296.26s -> 2297.26s]  It's Bert.
[2297.26s -> 2299.84s]  It's Bert.
[2301.98s -> 2305.01s]  I don't think he died.
[2305.01s -> 2306.01s]  I think he's still alive.
[2306.01s -> 2307.51s]  I thought you killed him.
[2307.51s -> 2308.51s]  Oh, I killed him.
[2308.51s -> 2311.03s]  I'm going way too...
[2311.03s -> 2314.64s]  Why is this?
[2314.64s -> 2324.60s]  Dude, can you imagine if you landed from that high up?
[2324.60s -> 2327.67s]  If you landed, like, flat on your stomach?
[2327.67s -> 2332.85s]  Dude, your insides would just explode.
[2332.85s -> 2333.85s]  Oh, God.
[2333.85s -> 2334.85s]  That would be so horrible.
[2334.85s -> 2337.85s]  You would not want to be at that crime scene cleaning that up.
[2337.85s -> 2343.12s]  What the hell was that?
[2343.12s -> 2345.96s]  That guy just...
[2345.96s -> 2348.27s]  Okay, I'll take the car.
[2348.27s -> 2352.13s]  Fine.
[2352.13s -> 2354.88s]  Oh, that guy's got an automatic gun.
[2354.88s -> 2355.88s]  Goodbye.
[2355.88s -> 2360.71s]  All right.
[2360.71s -> 2367.12s]  I'm going to play in cinematic mode for the remainder of the game.
[2367.12s -> 2373.94s]  Look at this, like, oh, it's a trailer.
[2373.94s -> 2375.94s]  I wonder how long I can survive.
[2375.94s -> 2381.38s]  Oh, my God.
[2381.38s -> 2383.38s]  I hope everyone in the stream just saw that.
[2383.38s -> 2386.37s]  I was trying to, like, hit you.
[2386.37s -> 2388.37s]  Dude, on my screen, you just...
[2388.37s -> 2390.37s]  How am I still...
[2390.37s -> 2397.50s]  How am I still...
[2397.50s -> 2401.50s]  I can't play this game for more than an hour, man, and my head starts to hurt from laughing
[2401.50s -> 2403.19s]  at, like, the nonsense.
[2405.45s -> 2406.45s]  Michael Bay present...
[2406.45s -> 2407.69s]  What?
[2407.69s -> 2408.69s]  What the...
[2408.69s -> 2409.69s]  What is that?
[2409.69s -> 2410.69s]  What is this?
[2410.69s -> 2411.69s]  What happened to us?
[2411.69s -> 2414.15s]  What is going on?
[2414.15s -> 2415.15s]  What is going on?
[2415.15s -> 2416.15s]  Why...
[2416.15s -> 2417.15s]  Is there a hacker in here?
[2417.15s -> 2421.03s]  Why am I, like, a teddy bear, like, hippopotamus?
[2421.03s -> 2422.03s]  Why...
[2422.03s -> 2425.00s]  Why...
[2425.00s -> 2429.00s]  Why are we, like, a parade float?
[2429.00s -> 2431.71s]  Hey, get in.
[2431.71s -> 2432.71s]  Get in.
[2432.71s -> 2433.88s]  Get in.
[2433.88s -> 2434.88s]  Get in.
[2434.88s -> 2435.88s]  Get in.
[2435.88s -> 2437.83s]  Get in here.
[2438.83s -> 2444.72s]  We got to get another person in this car.
[2444.72s -> 2446.72s]  Zeus is right above us.
[2446.72s -> 2447.72s]  Zeus, get in this car.
[2447.72s -> 2453.18s]  Take the other seat in here.
[2453.18s -> 2457.18s]  Somebody please get in here so we can have, like, a sodding can parade float.
[2457.18s -> 2458.18s]  Zeus is trying to land right now.
[2458.18s -> 2459.42s]  Hold on.
[2459.42s -> 2460.42s]  All right, let's just try...
[2460.42s -> 2461.42s]  Oh, jeez.
[2461.42s -> 2462.42s]  He's going out of control.
[2462.42s -> 2463.42s]  Let's just try.
[2463.42s -> 2465.24s]  Let's just try.
[2465.24s -> 2466.24s]  When I turn...
[2466.24s -> 2468.18s]  When I...
[2468.18s -> 2469.18s]  All right.
[2469.18s -> 2470.18s]  Before I...
[2470.18s -> 2473.18s]  Before I get into uncontrollable laughter.
[2473.18s -> 2479.48s]  When I turn, watch the heads go back into the car stalled.
[2479.48s -> 2480.48s]  All right, get...
[2480.48s -> 2484.21s]  We don't have any weapons.
[2484.21s -> 2487.21s]  Hey, guys, it's Paulie the hippopotamus.
[2487.21s -> 2489.21s]  Let's play Hungry Hungry.
[2489.21s -> 2491.21s]  Let's play Hungry Hungry Hippos.
[2491.21s -> 2492.21s]  Ready?
[2492.21s -> 2493.21s]  Just hit control.
[2493.21s -> 2494.21s]  Come here.
[2494.21s -> 2495.21s]  Come here.
[2495.21s -> 2496.21s]  Wait.
[2496.21s -> 2497.21s]  Come here.
[2497.21s -> 2498.21s]  Come here.
[2498.21s -> 2499.21s]  So I'm going to stand right here.
[2499.21s -> 2500.21s]  You stand opposite me.
[2500.21s -> 2501.21s]  And then just keep hitting control over and over again.
[2501.21s -> 2502.21s]  Hungry Hungry Hippos.
[2502.21s -> 2504.28s]  Ready?
[2504.28s -> 2508.68s]  It's Hungry Hungry Hippos.
[2508.68s -> 2509.68s]  Hungry Hungry Hippos.
[2509.68s -> 2512.45s]  Oh, my God.
[2512.45s -> 2513.45s]  Hey, Zeus is right here.
[2513.45s -> 2514.63s]  All right, Zeus.
[2514.63s -> 2515.87s]  Oh, Zeus is a normal human.
[2515.87s -> 2517.24s]  Why is he normal?
[2517.24s -> 2518.24s]  He must have died.
[2518.24s -> 2519.41s]  Oh, well.
[2519.41s -> 2520.41s]  All right.
[2520.41s -> 2521.41s]  Get in this new car.
[2521.41s -> 2523.16s]  Get in this, like, Camry.
[2523.16s -> 2524.16s]  Oh, my God.
[2524.16s -> 2525.16s]  It just pulled up.
[2525.16s -> 2526.16s]  Oh, my God.
[2526.16s -> 2527.16s]  What is happening?
[2527.16s -> 2530.07s]  What is...
[2530.07s -> 2531.07s]  How does this happen?
[2531.07s -> 2532.24s]  Are you guys in?
[2532.24s -> 2533.24s]  Look at our heads.
[2533.24s -> 2534.24s]  All right.
[2534.24s -> 2535.24s]  Watch the heads when I turn.
[2535.24s -> 2536.24s]  This is the funniest damn thing ever.
[2536.24s -> 2538.06s]  I've got to get some speed.
[2538.06s -> 2539.06s]  I've got to get some speed.
[2539.06s -> 2540.06s]  I've got to get some speed.
[2540.06s -> 2541.06s]  I've got to get some speed.
[2541.06s -> 2542.06s]  I've got to get some speed.
[2542.06s -> 2543.06s]  Hold on.
[2543.06s -> 2545.13s]  Watch the heads.
[2545.13s -> 2546.13s]  Here we go.
[2546.13s -> 2547.13s]  Ready?
[2547.13s -> 2548.82s]  All right.
[2548.82s -> 2549.82s]  Come on.
[2549.82s -> 2550.82s]  Get out of this mode.
[2550.82s -> 2552.38s]  I don't want this mode.
[2552.38s -> 2554.07s]  I want, like, the head mode.
[2554.07s -> 2555.07s]  I don't want to go too fast because...
[2555.07s -> 2556.07s]  Oh, it's the spirit.
[2556.07s -> 2557.56s]  Look at...
[2557.56s -> 2558.56s]  Ready?
[2558.56s -> 2559.74s]  Oh!
[2559.74s -> 2560.74s]  How do I keep glitching out?
[2560.74s -> 2562.17s]  I want to see, like, the heads tilt.
[2562.17s -> 2563.17s]  This is the dumbest thing ever.
[2563.17s -> 2564.17s]  How does this happen?
[2564.17s -> 2567.20s]  I don't know.
[2567.20s -> 2568.20s]  There must be an advent in here.
[2568.20s -> 2571.68s]  Look at the heads.
[2571.68s -> 2572.68s]  Look.
[2572.68s -> 2573.86s]  We look like Barney.
[2573.86s -> 2574.86s]  We look like Barney.
[2574.86s -> 2576.29s]  We look like Barney.
[2576.29s -> 2577.29s]  We look like Barney.
[2577.29s -> 2580.45s]  We look like Barney.
[2580.45s -> 2583.61s]  We look like Barney.
[2583.61s -> 2584.61s]  We look like Barney.
[2584.61s -> 2585.61s]  I feel like...
[2585.61s -> 2588.84s]  All right.
[2588.84s -> 2593.27s]  Look at what this looks like right now.
[2593.27s -> 2596.27s]  This looks like America's, like, most wanted videotapes.
[2596.27s -> 2599.27s]  And it's like, what kind of criminals are we?
[2599.27s -> 2600.27s]  You know what I mean?
[2600.27s -> 2604.27s]  Like, look at the criminals driving away in their crazy costumes.
[2604.27s -> 2606.27s]  Like, they're trying to hide their identities.
[2606.27s -> 2607.44s]  Wait.
[2607.44s -> 2608.44s]  What button do you press?
[2608.44s -> 2609.44s]  Cinematic.
[2609.44s -> 2612.77s]  That's V until you get there.
[2612.77s -> 2613.77s]  All right.
[2613.77s -> 2614.77s]  Here's the real kicker.
[2614.77s -> 2615.77s]  Oh, go on automatic control.
[2615.77s -> 2616.77s]  All right.
[2616.77s -> 2618.77s]  I'm going to laugh uncontrollably at this.
[2618.77s -> 2619.77s]  All right, Zeus.
[2619.77s -> 2620.77s]  Get in.
[2620.77s -> 2621.77s]  Get in here.
[2621.77s -> 2622.77s]  America's most wanted.
[2622.77s -> 2623.77s]  Like, the hungry, hungry hippos.
[2623.77s -> 2624.77s]  They robbed a liquor store.
[2624.77s -> 2625.77s]  It was like a helicopter like...
[2625.77s -> 2626.77s]  Oh!
[2626.77s -> 2627.77s]  No!
[2627.77s -> 2628.77s]  What was...
[2628.77s -> 2630.33s]  Did he just kill us all?
[2630.33s -> 2631.33s]  Yeah.
[2631.33s -> 2633.34s]  Oh, now I don't have my hungry, hungry hippo head.
[2633.34s -> 2634.77s]  Oh, no.
[2634.77s -> 2635.77s]  That was awesome.
[2635.77s -> 2636.77s]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[2636.77s -> 2637.77s]  Give us back our hungry, hungry hippos.
[2637.77s -> 2638.77s]  This is so funny.
[2638.77s -> 2639.77s]  I'm going to laugh uncontrollably at this.
[2639.77s -> 2642.55s]  All right.
[2642.55s -> 2643.55s]  Zeus, get in.
[2643.55s -> 2645.56s]  Get in here.
[2645.56s -> 2646.56s]  America's most wanted.
[2646.56s -> 2648.44s]  Like, the hungry, hungry hippos.
[2648.44s -> 2649.44s]  They robbed a liquor store.
[2649.44s -> 2650.68s]  Oh!
[2650.68s -> 2653.45s]  What was...
[2653.45s -> 2655.01s]  That was so funny.
[2655.01s -> 2656.19s]  All right.
[2656.19s -> 2657.49s]  So...
[2657.49s -> 2658.80s]  Oh, you should...
[2658.80s -> 2659.80s]  Don't shoot at the tires.
[2659.80s -> 2660.80s]  That's our only vehicle.
[2660.80s -> 2666.30s]  Oh, I think that's a good note to end on, to be honest.
[2666.30s -> 2667.30s]  Seriously, that was...
[2667.30s -> 2669.76s]  I don't know how that happened.
[2669.76s -> 2671.36s]  There was probably an admin in here or something.
[2671.36s -> 2675.60s]  I have no idea, but that was absolutely hysterical.
[2675.60s -> 2677.36s]  Hippo burgers.
[2677.36s -> 2678.36s]  All right.
[2678.36s -> 2679.36s]  Let me get on that bike.
[2679.36s -> 2680.36s]  All right.
[2680.36s -> 2681.36s]  Wait, wait.
[2681.36s -> 2682.36s]  Here's how we're going to end it.
[2682.36s -> 2683.36s]  Oh, my gosh.
[2683.36s -> 2684.36s]  Here's how we're going to end it, guys.
[2684.36s -> 2685.36s]  Ready?
[2685.36s -> 2686.36s]  Everybody.
[2686.36s -> 2687.36s]  Everybody get into where we're standing right now.
[2687.44s -> 2688.80s]  Boxing match.
[2688.80s -> 2691.48s]  And the last man standing wins.
[2691.48s -> 2692.48s]  So don't...
[2692.48s -> 2693.48s]  Not yet.
[2693.48s -> 2694.72s]  No, not yet.
[2694.72s -> 2696.08s]  Take the knife.
[2696.08s -> 2697.08s]  Put the knife away.
[2697.08s -> 2698.08s]  Put the knife away.
[2698.08s -> 2699.08s]  Put the knife away.
[2699.08s -> 2700.26s]  So everyone get to where we're standing.
[2700.26s -> 2701.26s]  No knives.
[2701.26s -> 2702.95s]  Only boxing.
[2702.95s -> 2703.95s]  So if we all...
[2703.95s -> 2704.95s]  If we...
[2704.95s -> 2705.95s]  Ready?
[2705.95s -> 2706.95s]  This is how it's going to end.
[2706.95s -> 2707.95s]  Make sure we get everybody here.
[2707.95s -> 2708.95s]  So this is how...
[2708.95s -> 2709.95s]  Wait.
[2709.95s -> 2710.95s]  Not yet.
[2710.95s -> 2711.95s]  Not yet.
[2711.95s -> 2712.95s]  Burgaboy just puts me in the face.
[2712.95s -> 2714.64s]  All right.
[2714.64s -> 2715.64s]  Wait.
[2715.64s -> 2717.58s]  Burgaboy.
[2717.58s -> 2718.95s]  Stop it.
[2718.95s -> 2720.25s]  Burgaboy.
[2720.37s -> 2721.37s]  One.
[2721.37s -> 2722.37s]  Two.
[2722.37s -> 2735.13s]  One.
[2735.13s -> 2736.13s]  Boxing fight.
[2736.13s -> 2737.13s]  Go.
[2737.13s -> 2739.01s]  Jeremy, you just disappeared.
[2739.01s -> 2740.01s]  I'm over here punching people.
[2740.01s -> 2741.19s]  Oh, I'm going down.
[2741.19s -> 2742.68s]  I'm going down.
[2742.68s -> 2743.68s]  No, I want to run.
[2743.68s -> 2744.68s]  I want to get on top of the car.
[2744.68s -> 2752.00s]  Like jumping.
[2752.00s -> 2753.00s]  Punch.
[2753.00s -> 2754.00s]  People are like running away.
[2754.00s -> 2759.21s]  Oh, it's because they're low on health.
[2759.21s -> 2762.25s]  I love how nobody's even grunting or talking.
[2762.25s -> 2764.11s]  So it's just like silence.
[2764.11s -> 2767.65s]  Ready?
[2767.65s -> 2768.65s]  Like...
[2768.65s -> 2769.65s]  They're just like...
[2769.65s -> 2771.02s]  Dude.
[2771.02s -> 2772.02s]  Gang up on Burgaboy.
[2772.02s -> 2773.02s]  Don't let him win.
[2773.02s -> 2774.02s]  Don't let Burgaboy win.
[2774.02s -> 2775.58s]  Gang up.
[2775.58s -> 2776.95s]  Burgaboy's dead.
[2776.95s -> 2778.76s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[2779.60s -> 2780.60s]  He has full health.
[2780.60s -> 2781.60s]  And I've none.
[2781.60s -> 2783.20s]  Oh, did MLC Stealth just win?
[2783.20s -> 2784.20s]  No.
[2784.20s -> 2786.08s]  Did this guy win?
[2786.08s -> 2787.96s]  Oh, and you're a winner.
[2787.96s -> 2788.96s]  Hissinggem2788.
[2788.96s -> 2789.96s]  Congratulations.
[2789.96s -> 2791.96s]  You won the punching round.
[2791.96s -> 2794.07s]  And you know what would win?
[2794.07s -> 2795.07s]  A knife to the face.
[2795.07s -> 2802.84s]  Oh, now they're bringing out guns.
[2802.84s -> 2807.47s]  Oh, man.
[2807.47s -> 2812.68s]  That was awesome.
[2812.68s -> 2817.37s]  That was amazing.
[2817.37s -> 2821.25s]  Oh, so if you missed it, if you missed some of it, we've been playing for just about an
[2821.25s -> 2822.43s]  hour now.
[2822.43s -> 2825.87s]  Oh, if you missed, if you just got here or something, this is all going to be on YouTube
[2825.87s -> 2826.87s]  tomorrow.
[2826.87s -> 2827.87s]  So...
[2827.87s -> 2832.48s]  There were some hysterical things that happened in this.
[2832.48s -> 2836.36s]  Like if you just joined us, you're going to want to watch it tomorrow.
[2836.36s -> 2838.80s]  What the heck?
[2838.80s -> 2840.88s]  All right, it's time for some QWOP.
[2840.88s -> 2846.57s]  That's how I pronounce drama.
[2846.57s -> 2848.09s]  So what was my final death count?
[2848.09s -> 2849.40s]  25?
[2849.40s -> 2850.89s]  Oh, God.
[2850.89s -> 2852.13s]  Wait, does it say?
[2852.13s -> 2853.77s]  No, they've been counting in the stream.
[2853.77s -> 2858.99s]  I'm just looking over and glancing over and seeing.
[2859.95s -> 2861.23s]  All right, thanks a lot for playing, guys.
[2861.23s -> 2863.15s]  If you played, I'll probably do this again.
[2863.15s -> 2864.47s]  This was actually pretty damn fun.
[2864.47s -> 2866.66s]  So thanks for coming.
[2866.66s -> 2868.88s]  If you joined into the game, into the session.
[2868.88s -> 2872.50s]  So now we're going to play some QWOP.
[2872.50s -> 2875.28s]  And yeah, thanks so much, guys.
[2875.28s -> 2883.21s]  Oh, that was a shot in the face.
[2883.21s -> 2884.84s]  Pull up.
[2884.84s -> 2887.10s]  How do I get out of here?
[2887.10s -> 2891.30s]  All right, it's going to be a black screen until I get QWOP loaded.
[2891.30s -> 2898.04s]  Q-W-O-P, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP.
[2898.04s -> 2900.36s]  Hey, yo.
[2900.40s -> 2904.48s]  I love Liberty City.
[2904.48s -> 2908.27s]  QWOP is a flash game.
[2908.27s -> 2914.97s]  It's a flash game where you have to use QW and then OP to run.
[2914.97s -> 2917.23s]  And it is incredibly difficult.
[2917.23s -> 2919.11s]  So screens, actually screens probably not going to go black.
[2919.11s -> 2922.80s]  It's probably going to be just my background.
[2922.80s -> 2923.80s]  Just my desktop background.
[2923.80s -> 2934.97s]  All right, let me pull up some QWOP.
[2934.97s -> 2940.27s]  Let me make sure the stream thing is there.
[2940.27s -> 2942.16s]  Oh man, that was funny.
[2942.16s -> 2947.78s]  That was so damn funny.
[2947.78s -> 2955.98s]  Q-W-O-P, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP.
[2956.94s -> 2962.78s]  I'm going to make it so it's just the QWOP screen because that's more fun that way.
[2962.78s -> 2963.78s]  Black screen.
[2963.78s -> 2966.30s]  Ah!
[2966.30s -> 2968.37s]  Screen region.
[2968.37s -> 2969.37s]  The QWOP screen.
[2969.37s -> 2971.75s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[2971.75s -> 2974.40s]  How are you?
[2974.40s -> 2976.72s]  And let's play.
[2976.72s -> 2985.19s]  So the goal, let me put myself a goal for this match, this round.
[2985.19s -> 2986.19s]  Slug.
[2986.19s -> 2987.56s]  Slug.
[2987.56s -> 2989.88s]  I'd say 10 meters.
[2989.88s -> 2995.64s]  I'm going to try and slug my way to at least 10 to 30.
[2995.64s -> 2999.12s]  Here we go.
[2999.12s -> 3002.60s]  Hold on a second.
[3002.60s -> 3006.63s]  I've got to get my mixer here.
[3006.63s -> 3008.11s]  It's going to be a little too loud.
[3008.11s -> 3009.48s]  There we go.
[3009.48s -> 3012.57s]  All right, let's move.
[3012.57s -> 3016.22s]  Yeah, TF2, I will do a TF2 stream next week, absolutely.
[3016.22s -> 3020.50s]  But tonight, I was just running, I had a lot of work I had to do, so I just wanted to unwind
[3020.50s -> 3024.20s]  with a little bit of GTA, and that was a lot of fun.
[3024.20s -> 3025.64s]  And can I play League of Legends?
[3025.64s -> 3027.68s]  That was one of the questions somebody was asking.
[3027.68s -> 3031.90s]  Me and Stealth actually have played League of Legends.
[3031.90s -> 3032.90s]  For like five minutes.
[3032.90s -> 3035.02s]  I'm just not that good, though.
[3035.02s -> 3037.96s]  I'm such a noob at that game.
[3039.36s -> 3040.36s]  Oh no, god!
[3040.36s -> 3041.84s]  No, that didn't count.
[3041.84s -> 3042.84s]  That didn't count.
[3042.84s -> 3046.32s]  That didn't count.
[3046.32s -> 3047.32s]  This will, though.
[3047.32s -> 3050.09s]  Oh, come on.
[3050.09s -> 3051.09s]  Co-op.
[3051.09s -> 3052.09s]  Co-op.
[3052.09s -> 3053.09s]  Co-op.
[3053.09s -> 3055.16s]  I just finished GTA, Mr. ADZY.
[3055.16s -> 3059.23s]  If you want to check out my YouTube channel tomorrow, it'll be there, the whole thing.
[3059.23s -> 3060.23s]  Go!
[3060.23s -> 3064.80s]  Go!
[3064.80s -> 3067.08s]  I'm actually starting to kind of understand how this works.
[3067.08s -> 3071.62s]  Oh my god, how did I still...
[3071.62s -> 3072.62s]  Wow.
[3072.62s -> 3075.27s]  Okay, I'm good.
[3075.27s -> 3076.27s]  And Diablo, I'm going to be...
[3076.27s -> 3081.68s]  For those of you guys that are still here, Diablo 3, I'm going to be doing a lot of live
[3081.68s -> 3083.82s]  streaming of that game.
[3083.82s -> 3087.37s]  A lot of Diablo 3 streams are going to happen.
[3087.37s -> 3088.37s]  So be on the lookout for those.
[3088.37s -> 3091.24s]  All right, I've got to get to 30.
[3091.24s -> 3092.86s]  Come on.
[3092.86s -> 3093.86s]  30 meters.
[3093.86s -> 3101.18s]  Use your slug powers from the slug god of sluggington.
[3101.18s -> 3102.18s]  You know what I want?
[3102.18s -> 3108.15s]  I want to go to like a track in real life and see, like just hopefully I'd see one guy just
[3108.15s -> 3109.84s]  doing this.
[3109.84s -> 3111.76s]  Hey, what are you doing, man?
[3111.76s -> 3114.64s]  I'm just training for the Olympics.
[3114.64s -> 3115.72s]  Like oh, good.
[3115.72s -> 3116.78s]  You'll probably get there.
[3116.78s -> 3117.78s]  Keep trying, man.
[3117.78s -> 3125.08s]  Like just like slugging, like go, go, go, go, go.
[3125.08s -> 3126.08s]  30 meters.
[3126.08s -> 3127.08s]  I'm going to make it.
[3127.08s -> 3128.77s]  I'm going to make it.
[3128.77s -> 3131.25s]  Oh, speaking of grandpa, the grandpa season one premiered tonight.
[3131.25s -> 3134.77s]  I'm going to make a tweet about it, but it's on Machinima Respawn.
[3134.77s -> 3135.77s]  Go check it out.
[3135.77s -> 3137.01s]  It's on Machinima Respawn right now.
[3137.01s -> 3138.81s]  Season two, episode one, the montage.
[3138.81s -> 3139.81s]  Go check it out.
[3139.81s -> 3140.81s]  I got a 10 out of 10.
[3140.81s -> 3142.50s]  I got a 10.
[3142.50s -> 3143.50s]  Oh, 30 meters.
[3143.50s -> 3144.93s]  I did it.
[3144.93s -> 3145.93s]  I did my goal.
[3145.93s -> 3147.10s]  Now I can...
[3147.10s -> 3148.10s]  Whoa.
[3148.10s -> 3151.52s]  Now I'm going to try and actually run.
[3151.52s -> 3152.70s]  Put it up.
[3152.70s -> 3153.70s]  No.
[3153.70s -> 3157.43s]  Don't go backwards.
[3157.43s -> 3159.33s]  So yeah, that's going to be it, guys.
[3159.33s -> 3160.33s]  Thanks for coming.
[3160.33s -> 3162.50s]  Thanks for sticking around, for watching GTA.
[3162.50s -> 3163.50s]  That was awesome.
[3163.50s -> 3166.46s]  And again, if you just came and you were like, oh no, it just ended.
[3166.46s -> 3169.15s]  It's going to be there tomorrow on my YouTube channel.
[3169.15s -> 3171.89s]  So yeah, I will catch you guys all soon.
[3171.89s -> 3174.34s]  One last try.
[3174.34s -> 3176.80s]  Come on.
[3176.80s -> 3177.80s]  Last try.
[3177.80s -> 3178.80s]  Come on.
[3178.80s -> 3179.80s]  I'm going to actually make it.
[3179.80s -> 3180.80s]  No, come on.
[3180.80s -> 3184.60s]  No, stay with it.
[3184.60s -> 3188.72s]  One more.
[3188.72s -> 3189.72s]  One more.
[3189.72s -> 3190.72s]  No, one more after that.
[3190.72s -> 3192.22s]  I got in a groove last time.
[3192.22s -> 3193.22s]  I don't know how I got in that groove.
[3193.22s -> 3194.22s]  I'm like tiptoeing now.
[3194.22s -> 3196.21s]  There we go.
[3196.21s -> 3197.90s]  I had it.
[3197.90s -> 3202.21s]  I had it.
[3202.21s -> 3203.21s]  One more.
[3203.21s -> 3204.21s]  You got to pull.
[3204.21s -> 3205.21s]  You know, the left leg has to come down.
[3205.21s -> 3206.90s]  Oh, that's it.
[3206.90s -> 3208.39s]  I can't do it.
[3208.91s -> 3210.27s]  So yeah, thanks everybody so much for coming.
[3210.27s -> 3212.59s]  Thank you so, so, so, so much.
[3212.59s -> 3215.07s]  And I will catch you guys next time.
[3215.07s -> 3218.47s]  Actually, stay tuned tonight to my channel because there's going to be a...
[3218.47s -> 3222.23s]  There's going to be Minecraft, a new Minecraft video going up tonight.
[3222.23s -> 3225.83s]  Because I got a lot of requests for more of that Woosh game theme.
[3225.83s -> 3226.83s]  The theme...
[3226.83s -> 3227.83s]  What am I talking about?
[3227.83s -> 3229.07s]  Woosh.
[3229.07s -> 3230.07s]  Why can't I not say this?
[3230.07s -> 3232.59s]  I'm like having like a seizure.
[3232.59s -> 3235.11s]  Woosh theme park.
[3235.11s -> 3236.11s]  That's going to go up tonight.
[3236.11s -> 3239.02s]  So thank you so much for watching, guys.
[3239.02s -> 3240.39s]  I'll see you guys all next time.
[3241.57s -> 3244.56s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[3244.56s -> 3245.56s]  See ya.
[3245.56s -> 3246.06s]  Bye.
