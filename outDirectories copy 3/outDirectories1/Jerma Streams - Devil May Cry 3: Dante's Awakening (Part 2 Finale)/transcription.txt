[25.14s -> 85.38s]  Hello, how's it going? How's it going? He was saying you're late. Yeah, let's clear the record here though.
[85.38s -> 96.93s]  Well, let's clear my throat first and then we'll get into that. I was gonna stream on Friday, but I got the day wrong.
[96.93s -> 104.30s]  So I pulled it back to Thursday and then I decided, you know what? No, I'm pulling it back again. We're going on Wednesday.
[104.30s -> 114.07s]  And here we are. I said I was gonna be around three. It's a little after three, but I reverse delayed, reverse delayed into a small minor delay.
[114.07s -> 132.81s]  I think that's fair. That's fair. You said Friday. Yeah, well, whatever. I'm here now. And it ain't Friday. I know. That's fine.
[132.81s -> 151.57s]  That's fine. That's a skewed concept of fair. Well, instead of having to having to wait two full days, you only had to wait 35 minutes.
[151.57s -> 168.30s]  That's fair for a stop. Your schedule has given me trust issues. Well, I guess the let me ask a question.
[168.30s -> 178.98s]  Is there a been be honest with me? Be very honest with me because I've been thinking about this for a while and and drop some names.
[178.98s -> 188.90s]  I'd love to hear them. I'm curious. Do you know of a streamer that is on time?
[188.90s -> 200.83s]  90 percent of the time, like a streamer that's like, OK, guys, you know, Thursday, I think I'm going to start streaming around like to who is always on time.
[200.83s -> 212.62s]  No matter what, they're always on time. I feel like most streamers are like 10 to 20 minute late, Andy's all of us.
[212.62s -> 235.50s]  You're literally the only one I'm not. That's no way. I'm definitely not the only one that's 10 plus minutes.
[235.50s -> 241.51s]  And I have a defense, though. I don't have a starting soon screen.
[241.51s -> 248.51s]  I have I do. But my starting soon screen means that I'm here right now.
[248.51s -> 253.51s]  And the starting soon screen is at most maybe 60 seconds before I start talking.
[253.51s -> 260.39s]  Maybe a minute total. I don't have a starting soon that last 10 plus 20 plus minutes.
[260.39s -> 267.02s]  That is copium, but it's I think that's good copium. I think that's good copium.
[267.02s -> 283.93s]  You are a lying prick. Hey, damn, geez. No, no, let's hear about he has a point.
[283.93s -> 288.36s]  That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, we got the founders coming in.
[288.36s -> 299.75s]  We got the founders coming in. When are you going to do a Bugleberry mukbang?
[299.75s -> 307.02s]  Yeah, that should be kind of funny. It's wicked fucking gross shit.
[307.02s -> 321.95s]  It's just like would not. It's just weird. It's just weird food items.
[321.95s -> 328.58s]  When's Otto's adventure remake? When are you going to do the beach episode for your channel?
[328.58s -> 336.87s]  The beach episode? That's so funny.
[336.87s -> 342.95s]  Damn, that's a good one. That's such a good one, too.
[342.95s -> 356.10s]  Just do a sitcom level beach episode, but it's just a regular stream and it's only it's it's 22 minutes long.
[356.10s -> 364.05s]  I should just do an entire an entire tournament arc until I ruin the channel and nobody watches.
[364.05s -> 374.32s]  You know what I mean? Like I should have a like three month long tournament arc where you know I'm going to win.
[374.32s -> 383.26s]  You know I'm going to win the tournament and you have to watch like 70 other people lose before I just win it.
[383.26s -> 390.66s]  And there's a ton of drama every time I get up there, but there's no way I lose.
[390.66s -> 395.18s]  I'm just not going to in the end. You know it.
[395.18s -> 407.36s]  You know that at some point I will be in the finals no matter what happens.
[407.36s -> 413.33s]  End it with a time skip. Yeah.
[413.33s -> 422.20s]  Holly, end it with a time skip that. Oh, my God. That's so right.
[423.76s -> 426.76s]  There's one thing I will promise you. There will be a point.
[426.76s -> 432.50s]  There will be a point where I just I'm just going to do whatever the fuck I want here.
[432.50s -> 435.50s]  And like it's going to be detrimental to the channel.
[435.50s -> 439.50s]  You know what I'm saying? Like it's going to happen eventually where it's just like whatever.
[439.50s -> 444.86s]  I'm going to do a fucking month long tournament arc and then do a time skip and just ruin the whole channel.
[444.86s -> 450.68s]  You know what I mean? Like who cares? At some point, let's just do it for fun. Who cares?
[450.68s -> 461.66s]  You do this already? Right now, he says. Right now, he says you do this now.
[461.66s -> 467.74s]  Well, whatever. That's fun to me.
[467.74s -> 472.74s]  There's also other things that I really want to just do that I think would just be fun to do.
[472.74s -> 479.14s]  I want to say this so bad, but somebody will steal it and I can't have this stolen.
[479.14s -> 482.81s]  I this is going to be so funny.
[482.81s -> 486.98s]  And I know, oh, my God, he's saying his own material is funny.
[486.98s -> 491.42s]  No, this is this is the funniest thing I've ever seen. I've ever heard of.
[491.42s -> 494.42s]  Now, that's a lie. That's actually like egomania.
[494.42s -> 499.42s]  But I don't want anyone to know this idea because I really do think you're going to steal it.
[499.42s -> 505.02s]  Oh, it's the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. I'm going to puke blood.
[505.02s -> 513.38s]  I got to dial it back a little. I got to I got to like dial it down a little bit here.
[513.38s -> 518.58s]  What if it's not fun? Yeah, that's the thing. That's that's also true.
[518.58s -> 524.00s]  A lot of times when I when I have an idea for something, I don't usually talk about it at all.
[524.00s -> 528.00s]  Because in the event that I get to the stage where I actually really am doing it and I go, this sucks.
[528.00s -> 531.18s]  This is awful. Then you didn't know about it.
[531.18s -> 535.18s]  And it wasn't funny. You guys are only seeing the things that I really thought
[535.18s -> 538.18s]  were going to make it to that point that were really interesting.
[538.18s -> 542.86s]  Lots of other stuff has fallen through that you did not hear of that you did not see.
[542.86s -> 549.69s]  We need our show failed idea stream.
[549.69s -> 559.45s]  There's a lot of you know, there's also things, too, that I think would be really, really interesting for 10 seconds.
[559.45s -> 564.70s]  And the problem with hiring a production crew
[564.70s -> 568.70s]  and spending a bunch of money on what amounts to 15 seconds,
[568.70s -> 573.13s]  a lot of times does not turn out to be worth doing, which kind of sucks
[573.13s -> 577.13s]  because there's a lot of like 30 second material that I would love for you to see.
[577.13s -> 583.14s]  But eventually it's just like, OK, that was oh, my God, that was I loved that.
[583.14s -> 585.57s]  All right. That's all I had to say today.
[585.57s -> 591.15s]  These would be explosive on YouTube short ticked. Oh, yeah.
[591.15s -> 597.46s]  Just move. Just do tick tocks.
[597.46s -> 610.06s]  No, upload it to YouTube, then do a variety show.
[610.06s -> 615.58s]  But long story short, I know we were playing Devil May Cry,
[615.58s -> 621.39s]  but I love the little I love the little little micro jokes.
[621.39s -> 630.38s]  They work so much for me. Depends.
[630.38s -> 636.41s]  But yeah, how do we even get on that? I don't even know.
[636.41s -> 641.78s]  How did I why did I start talking about that?
[641.78s -> 647.41s]  All right. TLDR. I wish I had one hundred million dollars
[647.41s -> 650.78s]  because I would just I would do one of these every day.
[650.78s -> 653.34s]  That's it. But unfortunately, I don't have that.
[653.34s -> 659.43s]  I would be it would be very really if I were too much, though.
[659.43s -> 665.78s]  You do. I do not. I do.
[665.78s -> 676.70s]  No, I do not. You don't have a billion.
[676.70s -> 681.89s]  No, I don't. Sorry to say play the game already.
[681.89s -> 687.26s]  I get my 10 to 15 minutes before starting a video game.
[687.26s -> 692.14s]  This is time for me to tell you about my day.
[692.14s -> 695.59s]  And then I will shut up and move on to the game.
[695.59s -> 698.59s]  But this is my 10 minutes here. I get the floor.
[698.59s -> 704.71s]  I get the floor before I wheel in the TV for us to watch in school here.
[704.71s -> 712.28s]  OK, it's been 20 minutes. It has been it has been 12 minutes total.
[712.28s -> 723.42s]  Come on. All right. Let's go. Silence.
[723.42s -> 727.05s]  Insolent viewers. Yeah, true.
[727.05s -> 738.46s]  Does it ever scare you how many people watch your streams?
[738.46s -> 743.61s]  No, no, not really.
[743.61s -> 751.80s]  I think that we terrify him.
[751.80s -> 753.80s]  What a terrifying thing.
[753.80s -> 760.06s]  I have a question for all the Dante's Inferno enthusiasts out here.
[760.06s -> 764.37s]  Should I just play on easy and just grind souls?
[764.37s -> 769.94s]  Is that an easy way just to get some extra money?
[769.94s -> 775.54s]  Why are you doing that voice again? What voice?
[775.54s -> 781.09s]  I'm not doing a voice. Why am I doing? I'm not doing a voice.
[781.09s -> 785.09s]  I just talk sometimes in different inflections when I'm talking about different things.
[785.09s -> 791.77s]  Just go still stay on normal. You have milk voice again.
[791.77s -> 793.77s]  I do not have milk voice. I know what it is.
[793.77s -> 805.31s]  I know what it feels like. Is this too loud?
[805.31s -> 808.94s]  Hard to tell over here. OK. Oh, no, we saw this, didn't we?
[808.94s -> 821.18s]  We'll watch it again. It's fine.
[821.18s -> 835.25s]  Turn up the volume. I will.
[835.25s -> 843.84s]  We can't hear shit. I'll turn it up.
[843.84s -> 850.00s]  Imagine being in a movie theater and the movie is like 10 percent volume.
[850.00s -> 853.82s]  How long is it going to take before somebody says that?
[853.82s -> 858.18s]  Hey, we can't hear shit. Turn it up. What the fuck?
[858.18s -> 864.82s]  Five minutes. What do you think?
[864.82s -> 868.77s]  It would take two seconds.
[872.44s -> 874.44s]  It would probably take at least five minutes.
[874.44s -> 884.08s]  Now, that would be really funny if for some reason the volume was turned way down in a theater.
[884.08s -> 890.75s]  And that was that old was it THX that sound effect.
[890.75s -> 892.75s]  Imagine that played at like five percent volume.
[892.75s -> 903.93s]  It would not hit hard at all. It would be kind of funny, actually.
[903.93s -> 909.02s]  Is an audio delay there? I don't think so.
[909.02s -> 923.57s]  Do you want to think you know what I think is the most important thing in any piece of media?
[923.57s -> 926.94s]  I mean this with my deepest heart.
[926.94s -> 939.57s]  Audio mixing is probably the most important thing.
[939.57s -> 947.74s]  Having audio be correct in a movie with different levels of how they're talking and different sound effects and music.
[947.74s -> 959.67s]  How loud there is such a fine line between this music is a little louder versus the movie is ruined now.
[959.67s -> 963.68s]  It's the audio delay. I don't have what I don't have. I don't see one.
[963.68s -> 967.68s]  What you have ruining it right now. I didn't do it.
[967.68s -> 977.86s]  Look, there's no delay. There's no delay. I'm fine.
[977.86s -> 987.58s]  The subtitles were ahead. It's very common in the film.
[987.58s -> 992.04s]  This person had a decent take. Let's see.
[992.04s -> 997.04s]  You can carry the piece very far. It's very common in film and video industry that if you have a good sound person.
[997.04s -> 1005.38s]  Oh, yeah. Sound is even something you don't even think of like when like a bird flies by.
[1005.38s -> 1013.38s]  You even hearing like when it flies by very, very faintly at like almost like not even one dB, like minus like 15 dB.
[1013.38s -> 1016.06s]  That makes the whole scene.
[1016.06s -> 1024.84s]  You've seen something that has like had like big rock music behind it and you take the music out and it just looks weird and just looks fucked up.
[1024.84s -> 1026.84s]  And just like what the hell am I watching? This looks stupid.
[1026.84s -> 1033.94s]  Sometimes action sequences without something behind it or really good sound and music mixing.
[1033.94s -> 1042.10s]  It's kind of like this like looks weird. I don't like I'm watching a movie right now. All right, let's go.
[1042.10s -> 1053.07s]  It feels empty. Yeah, I don't think I need to change anything.
[1053.07s -> 1062.43s]  Let's just go. Okay. I had my delay. I had my stall. It amounted to 15 minutes.
[1062.43s -> 1066.70s]  Okay, everybody's going to scream at me.
[1066.70s -> 1075.26s]  Oh, the last thing I did, I just beat that and tested monster thing, whatever it was.
[1075.26s -> 1090.83s]  Okay, and now I'll turn the volume up. That should be good.
[1090.83s -> 1097.27s]  Let me know if it's better to be where it was last night.
[1097.27s -> 1101.52s]  All right, I'm ready to play Dante's Inferno. Free order now.
[1101.52s -> 1115.55s]  Use the new weapon. I will in like a few years.
[1115.55s -> 1135.14s]  It's a weird place to be fighting in a few years and a few in game years.
[1135.14s -> 1137.14s]  This works kind of like dog years.
[1137.14s -> 1142.14s]  Every second that you and I are seeing is like in their universe.
[1142.14s -> 1146.14s]  It's about like two months. You didn't know that.
[1146.14s -> 1150.14s]  What did you think I was talking about? God damn it.
[1150.14s -> 1168.66s]  This game takes place in one day.
[1168.66s -> 1172.66s]  I have you. Have you seen the movie? Did you read the book?
[1172.66s -> 1188.62s]  I mean, clearly not. Oh, man.
[1188.62s -> 1193.65s]  Chill. I'm sorry. I just said something.
[1193.65s -> 1199.22s]  How am I supposed to respond to that?
[1199.22s -> 1207.01s]  I'm in a fucked up mood today.
[1207.01s -> 1212.42s]  You can always tell when there's a reverse delay.
[1212.42s -> 1215.42s]  This is a little bit of insider information for you.
[1215.42s -> 1219.79s]  If I tell you that, oh, hey, reverse delay, I'm streaming today instead.
[1219.79s -> 1221.97s]  You need to know that it's because you know what?
[1221.97s -> 1225.97s]  Today I'm feeling I feel like I am ready today and I'm ready to go right now.
[1225.97s -> 1232.96s]  I'm in one of those moods. Felt a little froggy. That's right.
[1232.96s -> 1236.48s]  Sometimes you just don't. You're not in that mode.
[1236.48s -> 1248.54s]  All right. Where am I supposed to go here? Down here?
[1248.54s -> 1255.76s]  I'm not. Am I missing something?
[1255.76s -> 1260.06s]  How long do you think you would spend in a bouncy castle?
[1260.06s -> 1274.27s]  Zero minutes. Wait, hold on. I didn't even see this.
[1274.27s -> 1278.51s]  This is a whole nother way to go. I didn't even see it.
[1278.51s -> 1289.31s]  No, I want the. All right. If you want the real answer, fine.
[1289.31s -> 1294.92s]  How long would I spend in a bouncy castle?
[1294.92s -> 1299.80s]  What do you guys think is the amount of time that it would be?
[1299.80s -> 1304.87s]  Hey, there's there's an adult in the bouncy castle
[1304.87s -> 1313.17s]  and it's been more than X amount of time.
[1313.17s -> 1317.17s]  Like, like, hey, like, who is it? Who's in the bouncy castle right now?
[1317.17s -> 1320.17s]  Oh, nobody. Just Uncle Frank is in there.
[1320.17s -> 1324.47s]  Just that's it. Just Uncle Frank went in. OK. All right.
[1324.47s -> 1326.47s]  All right. Uncle Frank is in there.
[1326.47s -> 1330.47s]  How long is Uncle Frank allowed to be in there before the family kind of gets together and is like
[1330.47s -> 1333.47s]  Uncle Frank's been in there for more than X.
[1333.47s -> 1337.59s]  I think it's probably five minutes.
[1337.59s -> 1343.95s]  It's definitely five minutes, two days.
[1343.95s -> 1348.32s]  Uncle Frank is camping in the bouncy castle.
[1348.32s -> 1363.96s]  Let him bounce. I need to get that item.
[1363.96s -> 1370.06s]  Stop being politician, Andy. Just answer the goddamn question, coward.
[1370.06s -> 1373.06s]  I am. Not every question.
[1373.06s -> 1376.06s]  There needs to be context with this question.
[1376.06s -> 1385.10s]  How long would OK. All context removed.
[1385.10s -> 1390.59s]  If I if they gave a bouncy castle just teleported behind me and it was just there.
[1390.59s -> 1392.59s]  OK. How long do you want to be in there for?
[1392.59s -> 1395.59s]  I would say 10 minutes there. I answer your question.
[1395.59s -> 1398.20s]  Ten minutes total, maybe.
[1398.20s -> 1400.20s]  And then you'd be like, OK, I don't want to be in there anymore.
[1400.20s -> 1407.46s]  I'm done. I just got a new thing.
[1407.46s -> 1412.46s]  What is that? Oh, I got a new weapon, too. Let's try it.
[1412.46s -> 1422.74s]  You're really going to stay in there five minutes more than Uncle Frank.
[1422.74s -> 1424.74s]  Really? That's kind of not all right.
[1424.74s -> 1428.43s]  Oh, god damn it. Yeah.
[1428.43s -> 1436.90s]  How can we get to stay in there?
[1436.90s -> 1438.90s]  You all yelled at me when I was in there for five minutes.
[1438.90s -> 1440.90s]  You don't see how long Jeremy's been in there for.
[1440.90s -> 1442.90s]  How come he gets to stay in there?
[1442.90s -> 1451.10s]  All right. Well, this is obviously the right thing.
[1451.10s -> 1461.90s]  But how does this work? OK.
[1461.90s -> 1465.84s]  Tune up. Special stands used to link into certain combo attacks.
[1465.84s -> 1469.84s]  Press Y while on the ground so that you switch the stance over.
[1469.84s -> 1475.83s]  Keep the left stick neutral and press Y while in tune up mode.
[1475.83s -> 1482.81s]  Devon is super complicated.
[1482.81s -> 1486.81s]  You need to dump like 30 K just for it to be functional, and it's super hard to use.
[1486.81s -> 1494.74s]  Why is it that every instrument item in every video game is always the coolest one,
[1494.74s -> 1497.74s]  but it's always the most complicated? You need a PhD to use it one.
[1497.74s -> 1504.65s]  It always feels like that, doesn't it?
[1504.65s -> 1509.70s]  Still cool, though. What about the gun?
[1509.70s -> 1514.67s]  What is this thing? Normal shot.
[1514.67s -> 1523.18s]  Oh, just kind of like a cannon. How does it work?
[1523.18s -> 1527.38s]  Ooh, this thing might be good.
[1527.38s -> 1562.52s]  All right. Let me just use this enough to do this.
[1562.52s -> 1566.34s]  Yeah. All right. I got it.
[1566.34s -> 1568.34s]  This seems kind of cool.
[1568.34s -> 1573.85s]  I have no idea what he's doing.
[1573.85s -> 1579.78s]  Oh, you have to have a certain power. I got it.
[1579.78s -> 1582.46s]  I don't think I want to use it, though.
[1582.46s -> 1589.67s]  It does seem a little complicated. He seems to get to stand still a lot.
[1589.67s -> 1592.67s]  Go back to those. Oh, yeah.
[1592.67s -> 1599.03s]  Ooh, wait a minute. Should I?
[1599.03s -> 1602.03s]  Somebody just rocked back in their chair and was like,
[1602.03s -> 1604.03s]  Hurry the fuck up.
[1604.03s -> 1613.50s]  Go on already. Please.
[1613.50s -> 1617.81s]  No, no, just play. Please. God.
[1617.81s -> 1619.81s]  So what? Let me look at this.
[1619.81s -> 1623.05s]  Hmm. I think this is probably kind of good, I think.
[1623.05s -> 1632.78s]  I don't know.
[1632.78s -> 1635.78s]  Okay, we're going. I'm going. I swear.
[1635.78s -> 1639.46s]  I'm going. Look, we're here. We're playing.
[1639.46s -> 1645.01s]  God damn it. I can't stand it.
[1645.01s -> 1654.33s]  And you just got a little too mad, didn't you?
[1654.33s -> 1656.33s]  Mom just opened up the fucking door.
[1656.33s -> 1658.33s]  Said, You're grounded.
[1658.33s -> 1661.94s]  What?
[1661.94s -> 1662.94s]  Fucking Jerma.
[1662.94s -> 1669.34s]  Getting me grounded.
[1669.34s -> 1670.34s]  Can't go over that.
[1670.34s -> 1690.26s]  I can't believe you got me grounded.
[1690.26s -> 1696.62s]  Have you ever been grounded before?
[1696.62s -> 1699.62s]  Who hasn't been grounded before? Okay.
[1699.62s -> 1705.13s]  Oh, he's a noob.
[1705.13s -> 1713.36s]  I'm trying to think if my mother or father ever were like,
[1713.36s -> 1715.36s]  Jeremy, you're grounded.
[1715.36s -> 1719.75s]  I don't, I don't think so.
[1719.75s -> 1723.34s]  You're grounded.
[1723.34s -> 1727.94s]  Why? Okay. What's happening right now?
[1727.94s -> 1734.46s]  Are these protected? Is that freedom?
[1734.46s -> 1735.46s]  Okay, it is. It is.
[1735.46s -> 1748.30s]  These enemies are kind of annoying.
[1748.30s -> 1753.86s]  What is my? What?
[1753.86s -> 1765.18s]  I didn't even come close.
[1765.18s -> 1767.18s]  The lock on circle is also the enemy health bar.
[1767.18s -> 1785.54s]  It's really good to know.
[1785.54s -> 1795.82s]  Okay, we're good. Go.
[1795.82s -> 1798.06s]  So what's game progress here?
[1798.06s -> 1817.26s]  I was here last night already.
[1817.26s -> 1819.26s]  I had the camera angles, so scuff.
[1819.26s -> 1821.26s]  Because this is a PS2 game.
[1821.26s -> 1825.82s]  And it operates under the Mario 64 philosophy of
[1825.82s -> 1828.82s]  you can tilt your camera just enough until the game hates you.
[1828.82s -> 1838.04s]  Wait, oh, there we go.
[1838.04s -> 1841.04s]  I can, sometimes I can actually adjust the camera to go behind me,
[1841.04s -> 1843.04s]  but it doesn't happen every time.
[1843.04s -> 1846.30s]  I need to look at the map for a sec.
[1846.30s -> 1853.88s]  Where am I, where am I actually supposed to be going?
[1853.88s -> 1858.06s]  Because all the way down here is where I killed that lady was here.
[1858.06s -> 1861.74s]  Alright, so where to now?
[1861.74s -> 1864.74s]  Back to the main hallway and go in one of these doors in the middle.
[1864.74s -> 1870.06s]  I guess just keep going.
[1870.06s -> 1877.39s]  There's a map. There is a map, but I don't.
[1877.39s -> 1879.39s]  There's two doors I haven't gone in, right?
[1879.39s -> 1881.95s]  In the top left and top right of the circle here.
[1881.95s -> 1888.03s]  He hates streaming.
[1888.03s -> 1897.63s]  This game's classic.
[1897.63s -> 1899.63s]  I'm just going to go in this, where am I?
[1899.63s -> 1904.52s]  What do I end up in here?
[1904.52s -> 1907.52s]  Okay, so now if I go up, I'll be back in that big room.
[1907.52s -> 1911.53s]  Did you get grounded for taking your whole PC into the bathroom?
[1911.53s -> 1915.75s]  Um, no.
[1915.75s -> 1921.41s]  Where am I now?
[1921.41s -> 1923.99s]  Okay, yep.
[1923.99s -> 1924.99s]  Let's keep going.
[1924.99s -> 1944.69s]  No, I didn't get grounded for that.
[1944.69s -> 1945.69s]  I'm not going to hit me.
[1945.69s -> 1960.15s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[1960.15s -> 1975.82s]  Is there shit out of me here?
[1975.82s -> 1986.89s]  Everything just jumps away from me.
[1986.89s -> 1992.88s]  I go to attack something and it just leaps across the whole map.
[1992.88s -> 2010.10s]  God, just die already.
[2010.10s -> 2019.21s]  Stop.
[2019.21s -> 2025.48s]  Set the game on easy already.
[2025.48s -> 2030.86s]  Hey, I've made it to Chapter 10 on normal in six hours.
[2030.86s -> 2038.66s]  I'm good, I'm good.
[2038.66s -> 2043.21s]  Okay, here we go.
[2043.21s -> 2044.21s]  Special power.
[2044.21s -> 2045.21s]  Oh, shit.
[2045.21s -> 2047.21s]  I didn't get the special power?
[2047.21s -> 2050.73s]  Did I really not get the special power?
[2050.73s -> 2058.66s]  It will be under items.
[2058.66s -> 2066.18s]  Stone mask?
[2066.18s -> 2067.18s]  What is this?
[2067.18s -> 2071.23s]  It's not it.
[2071.23s -> 2072.73s]  So where does this go?
[2072.73s -> 2077.08s]  Part rivers.
[2077.08s -> 2079.22s]  Is there...
[2079.22s -> 2082.22s]  I need to use that at a waterfall or something?
[2082.22s -> 2089.86s]  That would make sense.
[2089.86s -> 2096.79s]  Part water.
[2096.79s -> 2113.12s]  From here, I go up this way.
[2113.12s -> 2114.12s]  That's where I need to go?
[2114.12s -> 2115.94s]  Yes.
[2115.94s -> 2121.89s]  Here, the water.
[2121.89s -> 2127.50s]  There's water here.
[2127.50s -> 2130.73s]  No, wait.
[2130.73s -> 2131.73s]  Why am I...
[2131.73s -> 2132.73s]  Really?
[2132.73s -> 2137.86s]  I wish the indicator on the map showed where I was actually standing.
[2137.86s -> 2143.38s]  Because that yellow indicator to me is like, oh, that's where you currently are standing.
[2143.38s -> 2145.07s]  But it's...
[2145.07s -> 2147.02s]  Is it?
[2147.02s -> 2148.02s]  It's kind of like...
[2148.02s -> 2155.85s]  I don't know, it's weird.
[2155.85s -> 2159.39s]  Go this way?
[2159.39s -> 2160.39s]  No.
[2160.39s -> 2162.39s]  So is it this door back here?
[2162.39s -> 2164.39s]  I'm just trying to get to the middle room again.
[2164.39s -> 2169.04s]  I want to get into the middle room because there's two doors I haven't tried to open.
[2169.04s -> 2171.04s]  But this is weird.
[2171.04s -> 2172.04s]  Why can I not do this?
[2172.04s -> 2180.10s]  Because that's the only door that is listed here.
[2180.10s -> 2182.10s]  But is there one here?
[2182.10s -> 2188.25s]  This is where I came from.
[2188.25s -> 2189.25s]  So I should...
[2189.25s -> 2191.25s]  If I go in this door, I should be in this spot.
[2191.25s -> 2194.66s]  Okay.
[2194.66s -> 2197.93s]  So this door should connect to the...
[2197.93s -> 2203.86s]  But I can't go this way because I need the elevator to go that way.
[2203.86s -> 2204.86s]  Or that...
[2204.86s -> 2205.86s]  Open this door.
[2205.86s -> 2208.16s]  I need to go all the way around to go through here?
[2208.16s -> 2210.16s]  Somebody just tell me where to go.
[2210.16s -> 2211.16s]  I have no idea where I'm going.
[2211.16s -> 2216.02s]  Because I wanted to get to this middle room, but I can't go that way.
[2216.02s -> 2219.02s]  So do I have to go all the way around and walk all the way around?
[2219.02s -> 2226.47s]  No, help.
[2226.47s -> 2227.47s]  No, yes, help.
[2227.47s -> 2228.47s]  Help me.
[2228.47s -> 2233.17s]  Play the game.
[2233.17s -> 2234.17s]  Yeah, it's a PS2 game though.
[2234.17s -> 2237.17s]  Sometimes it's just like, oh, find this random obscure thing that is good.
[2237.17s -> 2239.17s]  You're going to walk around for 40 minutes to find it.
[2239.17s -> 2249.43s]  Wait.
[2249.43s -> 2250.43s]  I am in here.
[2250.43s -> 2253.40s]  Hold on.
[2253.40s -> 2254.40s]  But I can't...
[2254.40s -> 2256.34s]  Okay.
[2256.34s -> 2257.34s]  Yeah.
[2257.34s -> 2264.09s]  I cannot go this way.
[2264.09s -> 2265.09s]  So I just have to go all the...
[2265.09s -> 2267.09s]  I should just literally restart the save file.
[2267.09s -> 2275.98s]  It's the place before the boss fight.
[2275.98s -> 2277.22s]  Yeah, but I picked up the mask.
[2277.22s -> 2279.22s]  Where does the mask even go?
[2279.22s -> 2282.10s]  I guess I'm just going to go all the way around.
[2282.10s -> 2288.14s]  Whatever.
[2288.14s -> 2290.14s]  You're too busy talking about bouncy castles?
[2290.14s -> 2296.10s]  Not really though.
[2296.10s -> 2300.62s]  I got item B.
[2300.62s -> 2305.62s]  I need to place item B into pedestal X.
[2305.62s -> 2308.62s]  But I don't know where pedestal X is.
[2308.62s -> 2328.82s]  The long and short of it.
[2328.82s -> 2330.82s]  It's back where you missed the guitar.
[2330.82s -> 2333.70s]  So I just have to go all the way back around.
[2333.70s -> 2336.99s]  Okay.
[2336.99s -> 2348.34s]  All right.
[2348.34s -> 2349.34s]  So this is water.
[2349.34s -> 2352.99s]  I mean, there's only literally...
[2352.99s -> 2354.99s]  There's only literally two places where I could go do this.
[2354.99s -> 2356.99s]  So I guess let's see if it's in here.
[2356.99s -> 2364.18s]  Can't like...
[2364.18s -> 2367.18s]  Can't it be like the water or something to go over there?
[2367.18s -> 2377.81s]  It has to be right here.
[2377.81s -> 2384.81s]  It worked.
[2384.81s -> 2392.13s]  Is that not correct?
[2392.13s -> 2403.52s]  500 IQ.
[2403.52s -> 2407.82s]  I mean, there's no indication of where I'm supposed to go.
[2407.82s -> 2410.13s]  It just says, here you got an item.
[2410.13s -> 2428.50s]  The white glowing wall in this room?
[2428.50s -> 2433.74s]  I thought this was a statue.
[2433.74s -> 2439.29s]  Other lights like this have existed.
[2439.29s -> 2444.29s]  This white light here was in like a dozen other rooms.
[2444.29s -> 2446.49s]  Give me a break.
[2446.49s -> 2454.03s]  We've walked by statues like that a dozen times already.
[2454.03s -> 2471.50s]  That would be the 13th time then.
[2471.50s -> 2476.77s]  That light has shown up a thousand times.
[2476.77s -> 2479.03s]  Okay.
[2479.03s -> 2480.03s]  This is for the main bridge.
[2480.03s -> 2487.35s]  It's a granny game.
[2487.35s -> 2490.42s]  It's not a granny game.
[2490.42s -> 2498.23s]  So the main bridge is the one...
[2498.23s -> 2504.21s]  I don't think that...
[2504.21s -> 2505.21s]  Was there a spot I could put this in?
[2505.21s -> 2509.75s]  Milk brain.
[2509.75s -> 2513.55s]  It is a granny-like.
[2513.55s -> 2516.86s]  It kind of actually is a granny-like, but there's just nothing chasing me.
[2516.86s -> 2524.33s]  So I already got this one.
[2524.33s -> 2526.33s]  Where's the main bridge?
[2526.33s -> 2530.38s]  Does it say it on it?
[2530.38s -> 2533.56s]  The rotating bridge is in there.
[2533.56s -> 2535.82s]  So I just have to go back.
[2535.82s -> 2537.82s]  Is that where that thing goes?
[2537.82s -> 2539.82s]  That's where I couldn't power the device before?
[2539.82s -> 2540.82s]  Whatever it was.
[2540.82s -> 2544.73s]  And am I even going the right way?
[2544.73s -> 2547.73s]  I just don't even know what direction north or south even is.
[2547.73s -> 2549.73s]  I wish I had a compass or something.
[2549.73s -> 2550.73s]  Give me a compass.
[2550.73s -> 2553.73s]  Give me any indication of what direction I'm facing.
[2553.73s -> 2559.70s]  Okay.
[2559.70s -> 2560.70s]  And all the way around.
[2560.70s -> 2582.96s]  How did you forget already?
[2582.96s -> 2589.93s]  Because putting short-term into long-term memory is almost impossible for me to do.
[2589.93s -> 2595.11s]  It is very difficult.
[2595.11s -> 2598.11s]  With no guide system.
[2598.11s -> 2603.11s]  It's actually really hard for me to put into longer-term memory.
[2603.11s -> 2606.48s]  Especially when it's a very similar-looking landscape.
[2606.48s -> 2608.48s]  It's actually pretty hard for me to do.
[2608.48s -> 2612.09s]  Okay.
[2612.09s -> 2613.09s]  But we are there now.
[2613.09s -> 2624.44s]  I just have to go this way, right?
[2624.44s -> 2628.62s]  Because that...
[2628.62s -> 2629.62s]  Yes, it's this way, right?
[2629.62s -> 2633.36s]  Yes.
[2633.36s -> 2634.36s]  Because of the spider room.
[2634.36s -> 2635.36s]  And you fight the spiders.
[2635.36s -> 2636.36s]  And you go this way.
[2636.36s -> 2637.36s]  All right.
[2637.36s -> 2641.80s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2641.80s -> 2645.68s]  Also too, you can blame the video game industry.
[2645.68s -> 2650.68s]  Because the video game industry in the last 10 to 20 years has made it impossible for you to not know where you're going.
[2650.68s -> 2658.61s]  So when that's what you're used to for decades after this kind of concept here.
[2658.61s -> 2662.61s]  The video game industry now is just like, make sure that they have absolutely...
[2662.61s -> 2664.61s]  They cannot get lost no matter what.
[2664.61s -> 2670.26s]  Back 20 years ago, it was like, good luck, you fucking dumbass.
[2670.26s -> 2673.69s]  You got to remember where that ball goes.
[2673.69s -> 2687.98s]  That was...
[2687.98s -> 2689.98s]  Yeah, I just realized how he just did that.
[2689.98s -> 2691.61s]  All right, so it can be moved.
[2691.61s -> 2703.66s]  All right, let's go.
[2703.66s -> 2719.75s]  Hey, we made it.
[2719.75s -> 2722.75s]  It only took us like 30 minutes to get to this next part.
[2763.72s -> 2765.72s]  He butchered innocent people too.
[2765.72s -> 2768.72s]  He's the most vile kind of creature.
[2781.56s -> 2782.56s]  Yahoo!
[2782.56s -> 2797.86s]  We have something in common.
[2797.86s -> 2799.86s]  I have a dysfunctional family too.
[2799.86s -> 2801.86s]  And what would you know about family?
[2801.86s -> 2803.86s]  You're a demon.
[2803.86s -> 2806.61s]  This is my father.
[2806.61s -> 2808.98s]  My family.
[2808.98s -> 2811.98s]  This was all supposed to end by my hand.
[2811.98s -> 2829.58s]  How are they missing at point blank range?
[2829.58s -> 2831.20s]  Aren't you going to shoot?
[2831.20s -> 2834.34s]  It's kind of a Capcom thing, isn't it?
[2834.34s -> 2835.34s]  That's a switch.
[2835.34s -> 2836.34s]  Like they do that frequently.
[2836.34s -> 2840.71s]  I don't care anymore.
[2840.71s -> 2859.74s]  Jesus, that was so much louder.
[2859.74s -> 2860.74s]  All right, well, that's going to be high.
[2860.74s -> 2862.74s]  And we knew that was going to be high.
[2862.74s -> 2865.92s]  Oh, that's bad.
[2865.92s -> 2868.06s]  No, this doesn't count.
[2868.06s -> 2872.06s]  This is an issue because I didn't end the chapter.
[2872.06s -> 2875.06s]  All right, listen, it's really important.
[2875.06s -> 2876.68s]  I didn't end the chapter.
[2876.68s -> 2878.68s]  When we played last night, I beat the boss.
[2878.68s -> 2880.68s]  I didn't end the chapter.
[2880.68s -> 2882.68s]  I just kept running.
[2882.68s -> 2884.68s]  That's why it was an issue here.
[2884.68s -> 2885.68s]  Okay.
[2885.68s -> 2888.71s]  Won't happen again.
[2888.71s -> 2903.11s]  You're still alive, I see.
[2903.11s -> 2909.32s]  Is that you?
[2909.32s -> 2911.26s]  What's happening?
[2911.26s -> 2914.27s]  Where's your mother?
[2914.27s -> 2915.51s]  Mother?
[2915.51s -> 2917.82s]  You killed her, remember?
[2917.82s -> 2922.47s]  Yes, that's right.
[2922.47s -> 2939.78s]  The thing I've done was to succumb to his influence.
[2939.78s -> 2943.78s]  This is what it's going to be like when we have more microplastics in our blood.
[2943.78s -> 2959.48s]  True.
[2959.48s -> 2967.67s]  He's attempting to bring the demon world back.
[2967.67s -> 2971.83s]  The world that Sparda once sealed off.
[2971.83s -> 2975.21s]  Sparda thought he was a myth.
[2975.21s -> 2976.21s]  Flot twist?
[2976.21s -> 2977.64s]  What the fuck?
[2977.64s -> 2983.64s]  I thought he was the bad guy.
[2983.64s -> 2984.64s]  Stop him.
[2984.64s -> 3002.75s]  I one regret his talking in an evil voice and wearing evil clothes.
[3002.75s -> 3011.37s]  If only I presented myself differently.
[3011.37s -> 3049.45s]  All right, let's go.
[3049.45s -> 3051.45s]  Time for revenge.
[3051.45s -> 3054.97s]  All right, make sure I check my surroundings.
[3054.97s -> 3055.97s]  Lock it in a memory.
[3055.97s -> 3056.97s]  Get it in a long-term memory.
[3056.97s -> 3058.97s]  That hallway was right there.
[3058.97s -> 3063.70s]  I am now facing south in this room.
[3063.70s -> 3064.70s]  There's only one of the door.
[3064.70s -> 3065.70s]  It's not this one on the left side.
[3065.70s -> 3066.70s]  You've got it.
[3066.70s -> 3073.77s]  I don't know where I am.
[3073.77s -> 3094.29s]  Okay, cool.
[3094.29s -> 3098.91s]  Can I do anything with this spherical device here?
[3098.91s -> 3105.74s]  Why did you play Resident Evil 4 on normal and not hardcore?
[3105.74s -> 3106.74s]  You still on that?
[3106.74s -> 3110.13s]  You still upset by that?
[3110.13s -> 3115.59s]  I don't know.
[3115.59s -> 3121.86s]  I wanted it to be an approachable kind of challenging, but not really.
[3121.86s -> 3123.86s]  But focus on the game.
[3123.86s -> 3124.86s]  I don't know.
[3124.86s -> 3125.86s]  That felt like it.
[3125.86s -> 3126.86s]  How does that sound?
[3126.86s -> 3141.09s]  I'm not upset.
[3141.09s -> 3142.09s]  I'm just disappointed.
[3142.09s -> 3145.82s]  Yeah.
[3145.82s -> 3146.82s]  Well, it's going to be fine.
[3146.82s -> 3147.82s]  Don't worry.
[3147.82s -> 3148.82s]  Because I'm going to first try this boss.
[3148.82s -> 3154.41s]  I'm going to look over and see a ton of Pog use.
[3154.41s -> 3156.41s]  It's going to be crazy.
[3156.41s -> 3185.06s]  Where are you coming?
[3185.06s -> 3193.41s]  That's the way to deal with these.
[3193.41s -> 3194.65s]  Just shoot them.
[3194.65s -> 3209.20s]  Oh, doesn't.
[3209.20s -> 3211.20s]  Don't you just want to make the devil mad?
[3211.20s -> 3217.73s]  Oh, doesn't it just make the devil mad?
[3217.73s -> 3223.14s]  Freakish looking faces are etched into the statue.
[3223.14s -> 3227.71s]  Center face is tears of blood streaming down its face.
[3227.71s -> 3230.62s]  All right.
[3230.62s -> 3232.62s]  The middle one has tears of blood.
[3232.62s -> 3234.62s]  Where are we standing right now?
[3234.62s -> 3235.98s]  We are in this room.
[3235.98s -> 3238.98s]  This room is the one with the bloody eye statue.
[3238.98s -> 3244.22s]  Bloody eye statue in this room that has these six on it.
[3244.22s -> 3263.10s]  Are we looking for a bloody eye statue?
[3263.10s -> 3266.33s]  I would guess.
[3266.33s -> 3270.38s]  Can I do anything with this?
[3270.38s -> 3275.95s]  Does one of these have tears of blood?
[3275.95s -> 3281.10s]  I don't see it.
[3281.10s -> 3282.85s]  Be up.
[3282.85s -> 3289.59s]  How do I run up walls?
[3289.59s -> 3306.14s]  I know I can, right?
[3306.14s -> 3317.97s]  This is like sticking out.
[3317.97s -> 3340.18s]  Oh, I'm looking for bloody eyes.
[3340.18s -> 3342.18s]  I wasn't looking for a place to jump up.
[3342.18s -> 3354.17s]  Oh, I found it.
[3354.17s -> 3356.17s]  It takes a second.
[3356.17s -> 3360.99s]  Can I push?
[3360.99s -> 3365.30s]  Can these be broken?
[3365.30s -> 3380.37s]  There are two doors.
[3380.37s -> 3384.36s]  OK.
[3384.36s -> 3387.18s]  This door is a little too small for me.
[3387.18s -> 3389.18s]  I have to push it into that door.
[3389.18s -> 3392.91s]  Can you push?
[3392.91s -> 3407.08s]  There's one over here.
[3407.08s -> 3409.73s]  OK.
[3409.73s -> 3410.73s]  What?
[3410.73s -> 3412.54s]  What?
[3412.54s -> 3413.54s]  I just tried to do that with the other one.
[3413.54s -> 3435.36s]  This is a PS2 video game and you tell me it doesn't have the lean the shoulder down animation
[3435.36s -> 3441.14s]  that goes pushing something.
[3441.14s -> 3464.98s]  I hope I've got this lined up right.
[3464.98s -> 3471.50s]  Mind bending puzzles.
[3471.50s -> 3502.03s]  I love the earth exploding rat movie 2 sound effect.
[3502.03s -> 3532.67s]  Where's my style?
[3532.67s -> 3536.79s]  Sweet.
[3536.79s -> 3537.79s]  Oh, what?
[3537.79s -> 3548.57s]  Oh, I accidentally.
[3548.57s -> 3552.64s]  Is that the pizza tower orphan of cost scream?
[3552.64s -> 3554.64s]  I don't think it is.
[3554.64s -> 3559.78s]  Maybe it is.
[3559.78s -> 3564.29s]  OK.
[3564.29s -> 3565.29s]  I don't.
[3565.29s -> 3570.24s]  I don't think it is.
[3570.24s -> 3572.06s]  Where are we?
[3572.06s -> 3573.06s]  OK.
[3573.06s -> 3574.62s]  We're still in this room.
[3574.62s -> 3579.42s]  Another part of it, too, is going room two, room three, room four without looking at the
[3579.42s -> 3580.42s]  map.
[3580.42s -> 3582.42s]  So then it's like I don't put into memory where I even am.
[3582.42s -> 3583.42s]  But I'm doing that now.
[3583.42s -> 3584.42s]  Look, I'm getting better.
[3584.42s -> 3591.42s]  How's the audio?
[3591.42s -> 3592.42s]  Do audio need to be dropped like 5 percent?
[3592.42s -> 3598.14s]  We good?
[3598.14s -> 3599.31s]  A little loud?
[3599.31s -> 3614.38s]  Is it all?
[3614.38s -> 3615.38s]  We good?
[3615.38s -> 3616.38s]  Can't wait to.
[3616.38s -> 3618.32s]  Oh, I wanted that.
[3618.32s -> 3619.32s]  OK.
[3619.32s -> 3647.18s]  Can't wait for Bugleberry the musical to come out.
[3647.18s -> 3677.67s]  Stop.
[3677.67s -> 3678.67s]  Sing the song.
[3678.67s -> 3681.85s]  Uh, this one that goes.
[3681.85s -> 3682.85s]  Yeah.
[3682.85s -> 3683.85s]  Yeah.
[3683.85s -> 3684.85s]  I was the one that you wanted.
[3684.85s -> 3685.85s]  Yeah.
[3685.85s -> 3686.85s]  Yeah.
[3686.85s -> 3689.85s]  I'm a super beast.
[3689.85s -> 3717.52s]  Nice.
[3717.52s -> 3732.69s]  This game looks like it's kind of fun.
[3732.69s -> 3733.69s]  I would agree with you.
[3733.69s -> 3734.69s]  I think this game is kind of fun.
[3734.69s -> 3736.82s]  You can check it out.
[3736.82s -> 3744.08s]  How come?
[3744.08s -> 3745.08s]  Why is it?
[3745.08s -> 3748.22s]  You know what I'm really not happy with?
[3748.22s -> 3751.52s]  Cerberus only has two upgrades.
[3751.52s -> 3754.52s]  Everything else gets three.
[3754.52s -> 3756.52s]  Some some get four.
[3756.52s -> 3759.66s]  What's up with that?
[3759.66s -> 3772.46s]  What's up with that?
[3772.46s -> 3774.70s]  Change the sword master.
[3774.70s -> 3777.88s]  I'm going to lose my dodge, but it's all right.
[3777.88s -> 3779.88s]  I think I've gotten used to the A dodge.
[3779.88s -> 3781.88s]  I think I'm OK with using it.
[3781.88s -> 3785.59s]  It's front loaded because it's the second weapon.
[3785.59s -> 3786.59s]  That makes sense.
[3786.59s -> 3788.41s]  All right.
[3788.41s -> 3789.41s]  What now?
[3789.41s -> 3790.41s]  Does that change what I can do?
[3790.41s -> 3794.95s]  If I go into my.
[3794.95s -> 3795.95s]  Where is it here?
[3795.95s -> 3799.22s]  What menu is it under?
[3799.22s -> 3805.87s]  So does that add anything to Cerberus?
[3805.87s -> 3814.02s]  Yes, I do that all the time.
[3814.02s -> 3818.74s]  I do this all the time.
[3818.74s -> 3821.58s]  Yep.
[3821.58s -> 3824.14s]  Windmill satellite.
[3824.14s -> 3829.36s]  Spin your nunchucks around your body, devastating all enemies around you.
[3829.36s -> 3833.42s]  Ooh.
[3833.42s -> 3837.96s]  What's the type two combo for Cerberus?
[3837.96s -> 3838.96s]  Why?
[3838.96s -> 3840.14s]  Why?
[3840.14s -> 3841.14s]  Pause.
[3841.14s -> 3844.74s]  Why?
[3844.74s -> 3846.50s]  Why?
[3846.50s -> 3847.50s]  OK.
[3847.50s -> 3848.50s]  So why?
[3848.50s -> 3849.50s]  Why?
[3849.50s -> 3854.38s]  Pause.
[3854.38s -> 3855.38s]  Why?
[3855.38s -> 3856.38s]  Why?
[3856.38s -> 3857.38s]  Why?
[3857.38s -> 3859.82s]  Why?
[3859.82s -> 3860.82s]  Why?
[3860.82s -> 3862.06s]  Why?
[3862.06s -> 3865.35s]  Why?
[3865.35s -> 3866.35s]  Why?
[3866.35s -> 3868.35s]  Ah, yeah, ah, ah.
[3871.26s -> 3872.26s]  Ha ha ha.
[3872.26s -> 3873.26s]  Ha ha.
[3873.26s -> 3874.26s]  Ha.
[3874.26s -> 3875.26s]  Enough.
[3875.26s -> 3876.26s]  Ahh.
[3876.26s -> 3877.26s]  There it is.
[3877.26s -> 3878.26s]  OK.
[3878.26s -> 3887.74s]  So the pause is actually pretty long, tell you what.
[3887.74s -> 3888.74s]  Yeah, yeah.
[3888.74s -> 3889.74s]  So it's boom.
[3889.74s -> 3890.74s]  Boom boom.
[3890.74s -> 3891.74s]  Boom boom boom boom.
[3891.74s -> 3892.74s]  suite.
[3892.74s -> 3893.74s]  Four of course.
[3893.74s -> 3900.29s]  Boom.
[3900.29s -> 3901.29s]  So what does that one do?
[3901.29s -> 3902.78s]  That's the style button.
[3902.78s -> 3905.50s]  Right as circle.
[3905.50s -> 3906.50s]  Oh.
[3906.50s -> 3923.52s]  That's what I'm doing.
[3923.52s -> 3924.52s]  An angel.
[3924.52s -> 3935.46s]  Br марe you need to do that, boy.
[3935.46s -> 3939.95s]  I'll tell you what, next time I'll try and wear some cologne, okay?
[3939.95s -> 3941.95s]  It's the stench of betrayal.
[3941.95s -> 3943.95s]  The odor of that accursed sport.
[3943.95s -> 3946.95s]  I love voices like this and it's like half the characters in the game.
[3946.95s -> 3953.67s]  I want to do these voices.
[3953.67s -> 3968.52s]  Oh, I don't have a dodge roll.
[3968.52s -> 3970.52s]  I'm trying to dodge roll around this.
[3970.52s -> 3971.52s]  Whoops.
[3971.52s -> 4011.35s]  Oh shit, what?
[4011.35s -> 4013.66s]  He hit me with his stun.
[4013.66s -> 4026.26s]  I stunned him and it hurt me.
[4026.26s -> 4028.95s]  Oops.
[4028.95s -> 4032.95s]  Alright, so I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[4033.95s -> 4042.63s]  It's actually kind of hard to do those super combos during bosses.
[4042.63s -> 4044.87s]  Because they kind of just hit you out of them.
[4044.87s -> 4061.87s]  Alright, I think I did alright for a first try.
[4061.87s -> 4062.87s]  Let's go.
[4062.87s -> 4081.65s]  Dammit.
[4081.65s -> 4106.12s]  Sorry.
[4106.12s -> 4118.18s]  Let's go!
[4118.18s -> 4119.18s]  Oh shit.
[4119.18s -> 4120.74s]  Oh!
[4120.74s -> 4122.30s]  What's he doing?
[4122.30s -> 4123.30s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[4123.30s -> 4124.30s]  Oh my god.
[4124.30s -> 4125.86s]  Jesus!
[4125.86s -> 4135.67s]  Ow.
[4135.67s -> 4139.98s]  Whoa!
[4139.98s -> 4145.13s]  Geez.
[4145.13s -> 4156.48s]  Oh my god, that's a huge area.
[4156.48s -> 4161.15s]  You just have to run.
[4161.15s -> 4168.34s]  I'm dead.
[4168.34s -> 4170.61s]  Okay.
[4170.61s -> 4173.78s]  Alright, so his phase two, he says crush.
[4173.78s -> 4177.78s]  And then a gigantic AOE explosion happens underneath his feet.
[4177.78s -> 4185.62s]  You gotta be careful.
[4185.62s -> 4190.61s]  One weapon, Andy.
[4190.61s -> 4193.61s]  Let's not start switching around before I know his moves.
[4193.61s -> 4200.54s]  That shouldn't hurt you.
[4200.54s -> 4203.30s]  That shouldn't hurt you.
[4203.30s -> 4206.30s]  He's staggered and his arms can be...
[4206.30s -> 4209.30s]  His LEDs on his arms hurt you.
[4209.30s -> 4243.18s]  Alright, here we go.
[4243.18s -> 4263.51s]  Here comes his bullshit.
[4263.51s -> 4264.51s]  No jump!
[4268.61s -> 4271.51s]  Watch out!
[4271.51s -> 4272.51s]  Stop jump!
[4272.51s -> 4287.77s]  What the fuck?
[4287.77s -> 4293.68s]  Stop jumping, man!
[4293.68s -> 4302.04s]  Get me out of the corner!
[4302.04s -> 4303.92s]  No!
[4303.92s -> 4320.84s]  Try to get that range.
[4320.84s -> 4321.84s]  Oh, it sucks.
[4321.84s -> 4322.84s]  God damn it.
[4322.84s -> 4323.84s]  What?
[4323.84s -> 4324.84s]  Oh, it's alright.
[4324.84s -> 4325.84s]  When you lock on and you do the Diablo walk.
[4325.84s -> 4326.84s]  I just want to get in there, but I have to do the Diablo walk.
[4326.84s -> 4327.84s]  Oh shit!
[4327.84s -> 4346.74s]  I tried to dodge, but I had my button.
[4346.74s -> 4347.74s]  My hand was on like four different buttons.
[4347.74s -> 4359.67s]  Oh shit!
[4359.67s -> 4360.67s]  Oh shit!
[4360.67s -> 4361.67s]  Oh shit!
[4361.67s -> 4362.67s]  Oh shit!
[4362.67s -> 4363.67s]  Oh shit!
[4363.67s -> 4364.67s]  Oh shit!
[4364.67s -> 4365.67s]  Oh shit!
[4365.67s -> 4421.12s]  Oh shit!
[4421.12s -> 4422.12s]  Oh shit!
[4422.12s -> 4423.12s]  I tried to dodge, but I had my button.
[4423.12s -> 4425.12s]  My hand was on like four different buttons.
[4425.12s -> 4426.12s]  Fuck no!
[4426.12s -> 4429.12s]  I'm throwing it so hard now.
[4429.12s -> 4430.12s]  I was actually...
[4430.12s -> 4432.12s]  My fingers were on four different buttons.
[4432.12s -> 4433.12s]  I couldn't dodge.
[4433.12s -> 4435.68s]  Oh my god.
[4435.68s -> 4444.60s]  I had...
[4444.60s -> 4447.60s]  I had my index finger holding right trigger.
[4447.60s -> 4449.60s]  My left finger is on the stick.
[4449.60s -> 4452.60s]  I have to press left trigger to switch to this other weapon.
[4452.60s -> 4454.60s]  I have to then press right trigger.
[4454.60s -> 4456.60s]  I've got one, two, three, four...
[4456.60s -> 4463.89s]  I've got five buttons being pressed at the same time.
[4463.89s -> 4464.89s]  Start it over.
[4464.89s -> 4472.61s]  I'm playing Bop It with Devil May Cry in my hands.
[4472.61s -> 4479.03s]  That was such a good start too.
[4479.03s -> 4480.03s]  I threw it away.
[4480.03s -> 4481.03s]  I just threw it in the trash.
[4481.03s -> 4497.63s]  That shouldn't hit you.
[4497.63s -> 4498.63s]  They should patch it.
[4498.63s -> 4501.28s]  They should patch the game.
[4501.28s -> 4502.28s]  God damn it.
[4502.28s -> 4503.28s]  What?
[4503.28s -> 4552.07s]  Such an awful camera for this to be right now.
[4552.07s -> 4553.07s]  Please change it.
[4553.07s -> 4554.50s]  How do I make sure...
[4554.50s -> 4555.50s]  How do I force this to happen?
[4555.50s -> 4562.63s]  I have to just get him in this corner.
[4562.63s -> 4563.63s]  I jumped over it.
[4564.63s -> 4570.35s]  It's killing me.
[4570.35s -> 4571.66s]  It's killing me.
[4571.66s -> 4577.44s]  I'm starting over.
[4577.44s -> 4581.44s]  I feel like I'm going to eventually be pressing every single button on the controller and
[4581.44s -> 4583.44s]  I'm going to get an error message from Microsoft.
[4583.44s -> 4589.06s]  I'm going to hold left trigger, left bumper, then his right bumper, right trigger, Y, X,
[4589.06s -> 4591.06s]  and B at the same time.
[4591.06s -> 4592.06s]  And it's going to go...
[4592.06s -> 4602.33s]  And it's going to turn my fucking computer off.
[4602.33s -> 4605.33s]  I'm accidentally going to hit start and then press that combination and it's going to reset
[4605.33s -> 4644.79s]  the game like these old games used to do.
[4644.79s -> 4645.79s]  Turn this camera.
[4645.79s -> 4647.79s]  Turn this camera around now.
[4647.79s -> 4655.47s]  I hate that move.
[4655.47s -> 4656.47s]  It's so unfair.
[4661.94s -> 4662.94s]  Start over.
[4662.94s -> 4675.89s]  Please just do it.
[4675.89s -> 4682.93s]  The devil trigger heals.
[4682.93s -> 4685.32s]  Not very much.
[4685.32s -> 4695.09s]  I got to get to phase two with like 80% health.
[4695.09s -> 4697.09s]  Press R3 to reset your camera.
[4697.09s -> 4699.09s]  Yeah, it doesn't work half the time though.
[4699.09s -> 4705.61s]  I feel like it works when I'm out of combat, but when in combat it just doesn't work anymore.
[4705.61s -> 4706.61s]  I've been trying to do it.
[4706.61s -> 4717.38s]  What?
[4717.38s -> 4758.86s]  No, it does it every time.
[4758.86s -> 4767.52s]  All right, we're good.
[4783.14s -> 4784.38s]  Jump.
[4784.38s -> 4785.38s]  What?
[4789.94s -> 4790.94s]  Oh my God.
[4790.94s -> 4792.94s]  It's so unbearable.
[4792.94s -> 4830.69s]  What the fuck?
[4830.69s -> 4831.69s]  All right, here we go.
[4831.69s -> 4848.86s]  What's that?
[4848.86s -> 4849.86s]  What the fuck?
[4849.86s -> 4850.86s]  What is that?
[4850.86s -> 4852.86s]  What does that move?
[4852.86s -> 4854.86s]  Oh my God.
[4854.86s -> 4855.86s]  Okay.
[4855.86s -> 4872.74s]  Do I have any heals?
[4872.74s -> 4873.74s]  What does this do?
[4873.74s -> 4880.68s]  Do I need more of these?
[4880.68s -> 4887.17s]  I have.
[4887.17s -> 4888.17s]  Okay.
[4888.17s -> 4889.17s]  I've got heals.
[4889.17s -> 4891.50s]  I'm doing it.
[4891.50s -> 4899.01s]  It's not my inventory.
[4899.01s -> 4900.01s]  So, but okay.
[4900.01s -> 4907.30s]  If you can't use this item right now, it does not have heals.
[4907.30s -> 4908.30s]  It does not have heals.
[4908.30s -> 4911.02s]  Okay.
[4911.02s -> 4913.02s]  Devil star just refills ET.
[4913.02s -> 4914.02s]  Okay.
[4914.02s -> 4915.64s]  So, just use it.
[4915.64s -> 4916.94s]  Do a crazy combo.
[4916.94s -> 4917.94s]  Use it.
[4917.94s -> 4918.94s]  Do it.
[4918.94s -> 4931.06s]  Just train it together.
[4931.06s -> 4936.14s]  I'm buying this.
[4936.14s -> 4941.85s]  I'm buying it again.
[4941.85s -> 4943.85s]  I'm buying it again.
[4943.85s -> 4953.02s]  Did that just potentially fix everything?
[4953.02s -> 4956.03s]  That's a lot more than I had before.
[4956.03s -> 4959.19s]  Finally.
[4959.19s -> 4960.19s]  Holy shit.
[4960.19s -> 4963.19s]  I thought, I thought everyone was yelling at me not to buy things from the item menu.
[4963.19s -> 4967.19s]  I thought it was only for, only put it in your moves and weapons.
[4967.19s -> 4969.19s]  I thought I was going to be stupid for doing that.
[4969.19s -> 4971.19s]  I thought everyone was going to make fun of me.
[4971.19s -> 4972.19s]  Shit.
[4972.19s -> 5019.27s]  Oh, that was a stupid mistake from me.
[5019.27s -> 5037.79s]  And yep.
[5037.79s -> 5039.22s]  All right.
[5039.22s -> 5059.28s]  Let's go.
[5059.28s -> 5060.28s]  What?
[5060.28s -> 5062.28s]  Do you just, how do you get away from that?
[5062.28s -> 5064.28s]  Does that move completely unavoidable?
[5064.28s -> 5074.86s]  Oh my God.
[5074.86s -> 5075.86s]  This is so bad.
[5075.86s -> 5078.86s]  I have to hold down to dodge in that angle.
[5078.86s -> 5083.68s]  Contextually needing to pick a different direction to dodge to get it to do the right dodge.
[5083.68s -> 5085.68s]  Oh, it's making me want to puke.
[5085.68s -> 5096.55s]  So to dodge, you have to, you have to, you have to dodge laterally.
[5096.55s -> 5104.98s]  So if the camera is not behind you, a lot of times you have to hit down and A to do a lateral dodge versus left and right and A.
[5104.98s -> 5109.54s]  Or it just changes constantly to do a lateral dodge.
[5109.54s -> 5116.01s]  What the heck?
[5116.01s -> 5122.82s]  To do this, to do what I'm doing here, I have to like press down, but sometimes when you press down, you do a backflip.
[5122.82s -> 5127.82s]  Because your character turned around and you were locked on and the camera didn't turn around with you.
[5127.82s -> 5130.82s]  So a down actually turns out to be a lateral dodge.
[5130.82s -> 5135.24s]  This is freaking ridiculous.
[5135.24s -> 5136.24s]  And I'm sorry.
[5136.24s -> 5170.63s]  I said a swear word.
[5170.63s -> 5173.63s]  I keep, he catches me with it every time.
[5173.63s -> 5223.64s]  Oh my God.
[5223.64s -> 5224.64s]  Thank God.
[5224.64s -> 5225.64s]  I was in this mode.
[5225.64s -> 5241.22s]  Wow.
[5241.22s -> 5242.22s]  That move sucks.
[5242.22s -> 5245.63s]  Jesus.
[5245.63s -> 5254.25s]  My controls are backwards.
[5254.25s -> 5274.30s]  I don't want to fight them that way.
[5274.30s -> 5275.30s]  God damn it.
[5275.30s -> 5276.30s]  What is happening?
[5276.30s -> 5294.82s]  Oh my God.
[5294.82s -> 5303.87s]  Please.
[5303.87s -> 5304.87s]  Oh no.
[5304.87s -> 5305.87s]  I just pissed him off.
[5305.87s -> 5328.55s]  Oh, that sucked.
[5328.55s -> 5340.48s]  That was not good.
[5340.48s -> 5341.48s]  That was very bad.
[5341.48s -> 5342.48s]  That move.
[5342.48s -> 5343.48s]  I don't have any heals.
[5343.48s -> 5351.50s]  Turn it on quick.
[5351.50s -> 5352.50s]  Yes.
[5357.26s -> 5422.58s]  That fight was kind of rough.
[5422.58s -> 5428.76s]  So dodging like this and going backwards, but back to dodge backwards, it's up.
[5428.76s -> 5432.26s]  And when he's this way, you got to, it's like this way down.
[5432.26s -> 5436.26s]  It's, it's like patting your head and a, and rubber your stomach at the same time.
[5436.26s -> 5441.98s]  All right.
[5441.98s -> 5451.46s]  We're good.
[5451.46s -> 5452.46s]  Side roll suck.
[5452.46s -> 5453.46s]  You got to unlock and jump.
[5453.46s -> 5454.95s]  Yeah.
[5454.95s -> 5458.19s]  I've been conditioned from every from software game.
[5458.19s -> 5465.96s]  Unfortunately, just run back and just let go and run back.
[5465.96s -> 5466.96s]  Yeah.
[5466.96s -> 5470.71s]  I'm playing against the, there we are.
[5470.71s -> 5471.71s]  Okay.
[5471.71s -> 5482.30s]  We're back in it now.
[5482.30s -> 5510.74s]  From software brain rot.
[5510.74s -> 5511.74s]  You're not going to shoot me.
[5511.74s -> 5518.16s]  Are you?
[5518.16s -> 5520.04s]  If you do, you know, if that's what it takes to shut you up.
[5520.04s -> 5521.04s]  It's the crap.
[5521.04s -> 5526.82s]  Don't act so rashly, my boy.
[5526.82s -> 5527.82s]  I've got a doozy of a story for you, but if you snuff out my voice like that, I won't
[5527.82s -> 5528.82s]  be able to tell it now.
[5528.82s -> 5529.82s]  Will I?
[5532.47s -> 5533.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5533.47s -> 5534.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5534.47s -> 5535.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5535.47s -> 5536.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5536.47s -> 5537.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5537.47s -> 5538.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5538.47s -> 5539.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5539.47s -> 5540.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5540.47s -> 5541.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5541.47s -> 5542.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5542.47s -> 5543.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5543.47s -> 5544.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5544.47s -> 5545.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5545.47s -> 5546.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5546.47s -> 5547.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5547.47s -> 5548.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5548.47s -> 5549.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5549.47s -> 5550.47s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5550.47s -> 5551.47s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5551.47s -> 5553.35s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5553.35s -> 5558.11s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5558.11s -> 5559.11s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5559.11s -> 5560.11s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5560.11s -> 5562.36s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5562.36s -> 5563.36s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5563.36s -> 5565.37s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5565.37s -> 5566.37s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5566.37s -> 5567.37s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5567.37s -> 5568.37s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5568.37s -> 5569.67s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5569.67s -> 5570.67s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5570.67s -> 5571.67s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5571.67s -> 5572.67s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5572.67s -> 5573.67s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5573.67s -> 5574.67s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5574.67s -> 5575.67s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5575.67s -> 5576.67s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5576.67s -> 5577.67s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5577.67s -> 5578.67s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5578.67s -> 5579.67s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5579.67s -> 5580.67s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5580.67s -> 5581.67s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5581.67s -> 5582.67s]  You saw it too, didn't you?
[5582.67s -> 5583.67s]  That huge tower just above us.
[5583.67s -> 5601.78s]  It's really making me angry.
[5601.78s -> 5613.29s]  Everyone's saying this is me.
[5613.29s -> 5615.29s]  I'm like, no.
[5616.78s -> 5623.35s]  It sucks to have to know that.
[5623.35s -> 5624.35s]  Like that's real.
[5624.35s -> 5626.35s]  It actually is.
[5626.35s -> 5631.32s]  Like, yeah, I can't fight that.
[5631.32s -> 5633.32s]  I can't deny that.
[5633.32s -> 5648.70s]  Maybe not that part.
[5648.70s -> 5660.01s]  Try that laugh out.
[5660.01s -> 5662.01s]  No, no, I just won't play.
[5662.01s -> 5664.01s]  I can't.
[5664.01s -> 5668.68s]  Because it's going to be cringe inducing.
[5668.68s -> 5673.35s]  Let me get this to level two.
[5673.35s -> 5675.66s]  I want to level this up to two.
[5675.66s -> 5676.66s]  I'm curious about it.
[5676.66s -> 5684.04s]  All right.
[5684.04s -> 5687.92s]  He who holds this broken device is irradiated
[5687.92s -> 5690.92s]  and their soul is drained in exchange for power.
[5690.92s -> 5697.09s]  Oh, I got to go.
[5697.09s -> 5698.71s]  Where do I go?
[5698.71s -> 5705.43s]  Where do I need to go?
[5705.43s -> 5715.44s]  Oh, no.
[5715.44s -> 5760.31s]  Sweet.
[5760.31s -> 5761.62s]  Blow up.
[5761.62s -> 5811.43s]  Blow up.
[5811.43s -> 5824.77s]  Got it.
[5824.77s -> 5830.42s]  We're good.
[5830.42s -> 5832.42s]  This game would have given me an ulcer when I was a kid.
[5832.42s -> 5833.60s]  Hold on.
[5833.60s -> 5841.94s]  Come on.
[5841.94s -> 5844.59s]  Get it right.
[5844.59s -> 5845.59s]  Come on.
[5845.59s -> 5850.16s]  I got to get it right.
[5850.16s -> 5867.08s]  What?
[5867.08s -> 5872.54s]  What's happening?
[5872.54s -> 5873.54s]  I'm losing it.
[5873.54s -> 5874.54s]  I just freaked out.
[5874.54s -> 5877.06s]  I'm freaking out.
[5877.06s -> 5878.06s]  I can't fucking get it back.
[5878.06s -> 5879.06s]  I thought it was S.
[5879.06s -> 5880.06s]  What is it?
[5880.06s -> 5881.06s]  I'm dead.
[5881.06s -> 5882.06s]  It's higher than S?
[5882.06s -> 5883.06s]  Jesus.
[5883.06s -> 5888.06s]  Press B.
[5888.06s -> 5889.06s]  Oh, I got a new orb.
[5889.06s -> 5941.76s]  Nice.
[5941.76s -> 5942.76s]  Right.
[5942.76s -> 5945.22s]  I forget what style I'm on half the time.
[5945.22s -> 5946.97s]  Got to help.
[5946.97s -> 5950.13s]  What's going on?
[5950.13s -> 5951.13s]  What was that, dude?
[5951.13s -> 5952.13s]  What the hell was that?
[5952.13s -> 5962.52s]  Oh, my God.
[5962.52s -> 5963.52s]  What?
[5963.52s -> 5987.48s]  What was that?
[5987.48s -> 5998.13s]  Oh, my God.
[5998.13s -> 6000.46s]  What was that?
[6000.46s -> 6001.46s]  Oh, my God.
[6001.46s -> 6002.46s]  What was that?
[6002.46s -> 6005.23s]  Oh, my God.
[6005.23s -> 6006.23s]  Oh, my God.
[6006.23s -> 6007.23s]  What?
[6007.23s -> 6008.23s]  What was that?
[6008.23s -> 6014.04s]  Why did the game just do that?
[6014.04s -> 6015.04s]  You got to be kidding me.
[6015.04s -> 6019.33s]  That fucking hurt big time.
[6019.33s -> 6023.58s]  What?
[6023.58s -> 6029.91s]  Why did that just happen?
[6029.91s -> 6036.59s]  Whoa.
[6036.59s -> 6038.59s]  That was actually fucked up.
[6038.59s -> 6044.07s]  Is that a bug in the game that that can happen?
[6044.07s -> 6045.44s]  No way.
[6045.44s -> 6049.56s]  Wow.
[6049.56s -> 6050.56s]  That sucked.
[6050.56s -> 6052.50s]  I was at.
[6052.50s -> 6053.50s]  Hopefully that wasn't too bad for everybody else.
[6053.50s -> 6057.34s]  I think that was really bad.
[6057.34s -> 6062.08s]  Oh, my God.
[6062.08s -> 6066.05s]  Why the fuck did that happen?
[6066.05s -> 6073.50s]  Jesus.
[6073.50s -> 6074.50s]  Whoa.
[6074.50s -> 6084.82s]  Is everybody all right?
[6084.82s -> 6085.82s]  Like, I'm serious.
[6085.82s -> 6087.82s]  That was actually really, really bad.
[6087.82s -> 6089.82s]  Everybody like doing all right because that sucked.
[6089.82s -> 6094.52s]  I'm terrified.
[6094.52s -> 6096.52s]  I'm like scared to play the game now.
[6096.52s -> 6107.68s]  Is that weird?
[6107.68s -> 6109.68s]  Dude, it's the fucking HD remake.
[6109.68s -> 6110.68s]  Yeah.
[6110.68s -> 6115.82s]  What the fuck was that?
[6115.82s -> 6116.82s]  Really?
[6116.82s -> 6131.38s]  What was it?
[6131.38s -> 6133.38s]  I don't know.
[6133.38s -> 6136.38s]  It was something with the game.
[6136.38s -> 6140.26s]  I wish I could tell you what just even happened.
[6140.26s -> 6153.25s]  Because look, I mean, take a look.
[6153.25s -> 6158.51s]  The volume should never should not be even possible to go that high.
[6158.51s -> 6161.51s]  Even over here in my in my OBS, I have the mic.
[6161.51s -> 6163.75s]  So this is coming through desktop audio.
[6163.75s -> 6167.12s]  So desktop audio is set to I have it limited.
[6167.12s -> 6168.12s]  There's a limiter on it.
[6168.12s -> 6177.62s]  And in the game, it's only at halfway.
[6177.62s -> 6179.62s]  That was extreme.
[6179.62s -> 6182.78s]  Did you hit your mic?
[6182.78s -> 6183.78s]  No, no, that was in the game.
[6183.78s -> 6185.78s]  That was in this video game.
[6185.78s -> 6189.51s]  Fuck.
[6189.51s -> 6191.51s]  That's not cool.
[6191.51s -> 6199.19s]  It's a glitch on this level.
[6199.19s -> 6201.19s]  I've had that happen before.
[6201.19s -> 6203.84s]  Oh, OK.
[6203.84s -> 6205.84s]  Actually patch the game, Capcom.
[6205.84s -> 6207.84s]  Actually patch the game.
[6207.84s -> 6208.84s]  What?
[6208.84s -> 6221.04s]  Is that actually possible to happen here?
[6221.04s -> 6224.30s]  Dude, I am so fucked up right now.
[6224.30s -> 6228.34s]  Is it still count that I got this?
[6228.34s -> 6229.34s]  I don't want to hit the enemies.
[6229.34s -> 6230.34s]  I'm sorry.
[6230.34s -> 6246.08s]  I'm doing this till we're confirmed.
[6246.08s -> 6247.08s]  This is not going to happen again.
[6247.08s -> 6260.84s]  The shit is at five, not even three percent.
[6260.84s -> 6273.98s]  The game's muted.
[6273.98s -> 6274.98s]  Yeah.
[6274.98s -> 6275.98s]  This is the room that it happened in.
[6275.98s -> 6290.58s]  I'm not having that happen again.
[6290.58s -> 6291.58s]  I.
[6291.58s -> 6293.01s]  Oh, my God.
[6293.01s -> 6295.38s]  I'm like shook from that.
[6295.38s -> 6304.85s]  I'm going to like die again.
[6304.85s -> 6310.12s]  That's just run.
[6310.12s -> 6315.46s]  I don't think I'm going to make it.
[6315.46s -> 6317.46s]  Yeah.
[6317.46s -> 6318.46s]  All right.
[6318.46s -> 6319.46s]  I'm just going to run next time.
[6319.46s -> 6328.00s]  Wait, can I not?
[6328.00s -> 6332.00s]  Yeah, I'm going to have to like highlight this VOD and re-uploaded or something, because
[6332.00s -> 6335.52s]  I'm not having people deal with that.
[6335.52s -> 6336.52s]  That's so fucking awful.
[6336.52s -> 6341.74s]  No, I'm going to have to like do an edit to the VOD.
[6341.74s -> 6345.48s]  Can I just leave?
[6345.48s -> 6346.48s]  OK, I can.
[6346.48s -> 6359.18s]  I think I just run.
[6359.18s -> 6360.18s]  All right.
[6360.18s -> 6362.95s]  So where do I need to?
[6362.95s -> 6368.42s]  Where am I trying to get to?
[6368.42s -> 6374.26s]  Back to the beginning, right?
[6374.26s -> 6382.67s]  Come on, hurry up.
[6382.67s -> 6392.49s]  Fuck.
[6392.49s -> 6393.49s]  I don't know where to go.
[6393.49s -> 6394.49s]  Shit.
[6394.49s -> 6396.30s]  I don't have any healing.
[6396.30s -> 6397.30s]  Oh, that's bad.
[6397.30s -> 6401.60s]  All right.
[6401.60s -> 6403.60s]  I need heals, but wait, I'm at full health.
[6403.60s -> 6404.60s]  This is actually good.
[6404.60s -> 6412.41s]  That clip was blasted out.
[6412.41s -> 6420.85s]  But yeah, that's I know I take really seriously stuff like that, because I always people always
[6420.85s -> 6422.85s]  ask, hey, dude, your your game volume is kind of quieter.
[6422.85s -> 6423.85s]  This is kind of quiet.
[6423.85s -> 6430.58s]  The amount of shit that gets through the cracks in some of these games or that can blow out
[6430.58s -> 6431.58s]  people's fucking speakers.
[6431.58s -> 6434.72s]  I try to reduce it as best as I can.
[6434.72s -> 6442.39s]  But man, oh, man, something like that happening is just like, holy fucking shit.
[6442.39s -> 6462.58s]  No, where am I going?
[6462.58s -> 6464.14s]  I'm going the wrong way.
[6464.14s -> 6470.24s]  You should watch the clip.
[6470.24s -> 6472.06s]  Hold on.
[6472.06s -> 6474.13s]  We're in a cut scene.
[6474.13s -> 6493.01s]  But listen to the clip right now.
[6493.01s -> 6494.01s]  God, let me see.
[6494.01s -> 6497.83s]  Hey, is that even possible?
[6497.83s -> 6505.98s]  Why?
[6505.98s -> 6518.21s]  No, that's actually not all right.
[6518.21s -> 6519.45s]  I'm being dead serious.
[6519.45s -> 6521.45s]  I just listened to this at like one percent.
[6521.45s -> 6522.45s]  That's not all right.
[6522.45s -> 6525.39s]  Is that actually a bug in the game?
[6525.39s -> 6527.95s]  Because like, you got to be fucking kidding me.
[6527.95s -> 6540.70s]  No, I've played it.
[6540.70s -> 6542.70s]  I've never had this happen.
[6542.70s -> 6546.86s]  Dude, we know you farted.
[6546.86s -> 6551.04s]  This is the PC version.
[6551.04s -> 6553.04s]  Yeah, this is the Steam HD version.
[6553.04s -> 6559.38s]  Oh my goodness.
[6559.38s -> 6563.75s]  I mean, how?
[6563.75s -> 6564.75s]  Why did that?
[6564.75s -> 6566.75s]  I don't even have an explanation for you.
[6566.75s -> 6571.26s]  Is there something on my end?
[6571.26s -> 6573.26s]  I don't think so.
[6573.26s -> 6575.52s]  Not that I could see.
[6575.52s -> 6579.52s]  I mean, I've been sitting here playing it the same way since like, you know, two, three
[6579.52s -> 6580.52s]  hours ago since last night.
[6580.52s -> 6584.58s]  Restart the game?
[6584.58s -> 6591.10s]  Yeah, I'm going to restart the game.
[6591.10s -> 6594.10s]  The whole HD collection has audio bugs from what my understanding.
[6594.10s -> 6597.75s]  An HD edition only bug.
[6597.75s -> 6611.32s]  Are you in a Discord call?
[6611.32s -> 6612.32s]  No, no, I'm not.
[6612.32s -> 6617.21s]  All right.
[6617.21s -> 6621.96s]  Let me restart the game to get like the audio kind of recombobulated.
[6621.96s -> 6629.86s]  And one of the some of the mods have editing access.
[6629.86s -> 6634.50s]  Can some because I can't really do it right now while I'm live.
[6634.50s -> 6639.50s]  Can one of the mods go and do a highlight of the stream like two or three seconds before
[6639.50s -> 6641.77s]  that part?
[6641.77s -> 6646.99s]  And then I'm trying to think how to do this to get rid of that.
[6646.99s -> 6649.70s]  I'll finish the mission.
[6649.70s -> 6650.70s]  Yeah.
[6650.70s -> 6651.70s]  But this is staying on like one percent.
[6651.70s -> 6667.79s]  Yeah.
[6667.79s -> 6669.79s]  Highlight before and after and then we'll delete the VOD.
[6669.79s -> 6673.27s]  Right.
[6673.27s -> 6675.28s]  I'm going in the wrong direction.
[6675.28s -> 6676.28s]  What a sound warning.
[6676.28s -> 6677.97s]  Yeah.
[6677.97s -> 6683.36s]  I mean, a sound warning for a kind of a jump scare or something is one thing, but I just
[6683.36s -> 6684.36s]  listen to that.
[6684.36s -> 6685.36s]  I've and I've been jump scared.
[6685.36s -> 6687.36s]  I've had loud shit happen on this stream.
[6687.36s -> 6691.37s]  That's I don't want anybody fucking hear that.
[6691.37s -> 6696.37s]  That was well and beyond what like a jump scare or like a loud sound or something.
[6696.37s -> 6704.26s]  Okay.
[6704.26s -> 6710.05s]  Is there a safe point here?
[6710.05s -> 6711.05s]  Why wouldn't you play this on Switch?
[6711.05s -> 6713.31s]  I don't know, dude.
[6713.31s -> 6714.31s]  I didn't know that.
[6714.31s -> 6719.31s]  Oh, by the way, there's like ear exploding audio bugs in the HD Steam version.
[6719.31s -> 6720.31s]  I didn't know that.
[6720.31s -> 6721.74s]  I didn't know.
[6721.74s -> 6723.74s]  I just bought the game on Steam.
[6723.74s -> 6737.23s]  I'm just a consumer in this.
[6737.23s -> 6739.24s]  Okay.
[6739.24s -> 6740.24s]  I don't think I can save it.
[6740.24s -> 6746.64s]  I really hope that doesn't happen again.
[6746.64s -> 6748.64s]  It actually is freaking me out.
[6748.64s -> 6749.82s]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[6749.82s -> 6764.18s]  So I try them again.
[6764.18s -> 6778.42s]  Turn on latency mode so you can cut it if it happens again.
[6778.42s -> 6782.05s]  I wonder what the process of that would look like.
[6782.05s -> 6796.86s]  Live editing.
[6796.86s -> 6807.56s]  There's audio bugs and then there's something is potentially left in the game that can like
[6807.56s -> 6821.35s]  break people's fucking computers like speakers, headphones, even me.
[6821.35s -> 6842.37s]  There's no evidence that it was in the game.
[6842.37s -> 6843.37s]  Yeah.
[6843.37s -> 6845.61s]  Well, that's why I'd like to investigate it a little bit more.
[6845.61s -> 6856.04s]  But I have met my OBS settings have been the same from it's got to be like a half a decade
[6856.04s -> 6857.04s]  at this point.
[6857.04s -> 6858.04s]  I didn't really change anything.
[6858.04s -> 6891.00s]  Why would you settings matter if it was a bug?
[6893.33s -> 6897.33s]  I don't want to watch the clip again, but it looked like when I switched, I switched
[6897.33s -> 6898.33s]  between weapons.
[6898.33s -> 6900.33s]  So I went, I attacked with the nunchucks.
[6900.33s -> 6902.33s]  And then I in mid combo, I went, wham.
[6902.33s -> 6905.70s]  And I switched over to this and I did that this move, that one.
[6905.70s -> 6911.77s]  And I think it hit something and hit them in the game's brain like a thousand times
[6911.77s -> 6912.77s]  in a second or something.
[6912.77s -> 6923.29s]  Oh my God.
[6923.29s -> 6930.54s]  I'm going to die.
[6930.54s -> 6936.33s]  I want to die.
[6936.33s -> 6939.22s]  Hi.
[6939.22s -> 6940.22s]  What?
[6940.22s -> 6941.22s]  Oh my God.
[6941.22s -> 6955.24s]  What is going on right now?
[6955.24s -> 6956.24s]  Why did he at one HP?
[6956.24s -> 6965.74s]  Yeah.
[6965.74s -> 6969.74s]  Add to the VOD, add a thing that says like, don't watch this VOD of loud sound.
[6969.74s -> 6987.55s]  Make sure people know that before we, you know, delete it.
[6987.55s -> 6990.55s]  I could also BRB and so I could do a restart of the stream.
[6990.55s -> 7002.57s]  I think that's probably what I'm going to do.
[7002.57s -> 7003.57s]  Oh, you can unpublish the VOD.
[7003.57s -> 7004.57s]  Okay.
[7004.57s -> 7016.24s]  Then do that.
[7016.24s -> 7017.24s]  Don't watch this VOD.
[7017.24s -> 7035.50s]  Seriously.
[7035.50s -> 7036.50s]  You've been louder before?
[7036.50s -> 7038.83s]  No, no way.
[7038.83s -> 7042.83s]  When I listened to that clip at like 0.2% volume, that's the loudest that this stream has ever
[7042.83s -> 7064.10s]  been.
[7064.10s -> 7066.86s]  Once I get this kill, I'm going to restart the game.
[7066.86s -> 7077.44s]  All right.
[7077.44s -> 7088.86s]  Well, this part's annoying.
[7088.86s -> 7089.86s]  Okay.
[7089.86s -> 7104.54s]  Oh my God.
[7104.54s -> 7106.74s]  I'm going to lose again.
[7106.74s -> 7107.74s]  I actually might.
[7107.74s -> 7109.42s]  No, I'm not.
[7109.42s -> 7113.54s]  I don't care.
[7113.54s -> 7143.52s]  I am Andy.
[7143.52s -> 7144.52s]  I would have died right there.
[7144.52s -> 7145.52s]  Yeah.
[7145.52s -> 7146.52s]  Sorry.
[7146.52s -> 7148.85s]  It's been silent, but I need to restart the game and we've got to make sure that the VOD
[7148.85s -> 7158.32s]  is not going to fuck a bunch of people up.
[7158.32s -> 7161.86s]  Haunted.
[7161.86s -> 7162.86s]  Put music on.
[7162.86s -> 7166.73s]  I'll put a little music on in the background.
[7166.73s -> 7170.27s]  That makes sense to me.
[7170.27s -> 7183.02s]  How about reduce the game volume from the actual mixer?
[7183.02s -> 7187.02s]  If the audio engine is bugged out, it will ignore your in-game settings and go super
[7187.02s -> 7190.95s]  loud again.
[7190.95s -> 7191.95s]  Yeah.
[7191.95s -> 7192.95s]  I'll go right to the source here and I'll just put it here.
[7192.95s -> 7193.95s]  I wonder if that helps.
[7197.88s -> 7200.44s]  I'm going to put it at like 20% in the mixer.
[7200.44s -> 7205.14s]  Volume gate.
[7205.14s -> 7208.63s]  I have a volume gate on OBS.
[7208.63s -> 7213.87s]  I have a slider where I can put that the audio should never go over that, but sometimes it
[7213.87s -> 7214.87s]  just doesn't matter apparently.
[7214.87s -> 7220.50s]  Let me get to the end of this and save the game.
[7220.50s -> 7234.89s]  See if that fixed it.
[7234.89s -> 7247.16s]  I need a save point.
[7247.16s -> 7251.64s]  What did that even just do?
[7251.64s -> 7252.64s]  Did I get an item?
[7252.64s -> 7254.84s]  Okay.
[7254.84s -> 7258.38s]  Here we go.
[7258.38s -> 7259.38s]  Save data.
[7259.38s -> 7261.39s]  Save complete.
[7261.39s -> 7262.70s]  All right.
[7262.70s -> 7263.70s]  Let me restart this.
[7263.70s -> 7269.26s]  I'll give the mods the ability to clean up that VOD and do all this shit.
[7269.26s -> 7270.50s]  Let me get some water.
[7270.50s -> 7271.50s]  Take a break.
[7271.50s -> 7272.50s]  I'll be right back.
[7272.50s -> 7312.78s]  Water time.
[7312.78s -> 7704.93s]  Okay.
[7704.93s -> 7705.93s]  Hello.
[7705.93s -> 7707.23s]  I'm back.
[7707.23s -> 7713.67s]  I am going to reopen Devil May Cry.
[7713.67s -> 7720.67s]  I have it set in Windows for it to never be possible to go over a certain decibel in Windows.
[7720.67s -> 7722.94s]  I'll be honest with you.
[7722.94s -> 7724.94s]  I'm fucking paranoid about this now.
[7724.94s -> 7728.33s]  If it happens once, it means it can happen twice.
[7728.33s -> 7729.33s]  You know what I'm saying?
[7729.33s -> 7737.10s]  Let me get it open.
[7737.10s -> 7742.90s]  Should we remove clips of the noise?
[7742.90s -> 7744.46s]  Yeah.
[7744.46s -> 7755.58s]  Guys, if you've got clips, make sure the clips say in the title, like audio warning because
[7755.58s -> 7758.58s]  we've got to be fucking careful with that shit.
[7758.58s -> 7777.06s]  There's no way that came out of the game.
[7777.06s -> 7781.06s]  Yeah, but that's also freaking me out because it's like, where would it be coming from from
[7781.06s -> 7782.06s]  my end too?
[7782.06s -> 7786.37s]  I am flabbergasted as to how that happened.
[7786.37s -> 7796.67s]  Let me make sure this is going to happen the way that I want it to.
[7796.67s -> 7797.67s]  Mixer.
[7797.67s -> 7799.17s]  All right.
[7799.17s -> 7802.82s]  It's at 30 percentile.
[7802.82s -> 7829.85s]  I almost want to...
[7829.85s -> 7830.85s]  Yeah, we'll see.
[7830.85s -> 7836.98s]  I have no idea what happened, but I don't honestly think it probably is not a way to
[7836.98s -> 7839.98s]  ever know what actually just happened.
[7839.98s -> 7850.80s]  Okay, so now I have it set.
[7850.80s -> 7858.22s]  Volume is in the same place.
[7858.22s -> 7861.22s]  I put the volume on the Windows Mixer down.
[7861.22s -> 7864.30s]  Let's see if that helps.
[7864.30s -> 7894.36s]  Let's go back here and see it.
[7894.36s -> 7909.21s]  Where's the last save point?
[7909.21s -> 7911.47s]  Oh, shit.
[7911.47s -> 7920.26s]  Oh, no.
[7920.26s -> 7923.02s]  How far back did I go?
[7923.02s -> 7926.43s]  That's not terrible.
[7926.43s -> 7928.93s]  Oh, is it terrible?
[7928.93s -> 7930.23s]  No, it's not.
[7930.23s -> 7945.94s]  I just have to go fast.
[7945.94s -> 7949.24s]  I know the audio is probably a little low right now, but I'm trying to get it to a point
[7949.24s -> 7951.24s]  where it's not horrible if that happens again.
[7951.24s -> 7968.58s]  Better raise my volume.
[7968.58s -> 8003.55s]  No, don't.
[8003.55s -> 8004.55s]  Jesus.
[8004.55s -> 8019.17s]  What if it happens again?
[8019.17s -> 8020.47s]  I don't know.
[8020.47s -> 8026.66s]  That's why I'm being like super quiet and timid, right?
[8026.66s -> 8029.66s]  The energy has changed since then.
[8029.66s -> 8030.66s]  You know what I'm saying?
[8030.66s -> 8031.97s]  It's changed.
[8031.97s -> 8052.82s]  Are you just shaking?
[8052.82s -> 8053.82s]  I don't know how loud...
[8053.82s -> 8062.26s]  I turned up my speakers on my end here independently before that happened, so I got hit in the fucking
[8062.26s -> 8064.26s]  head with like a brick.
[8064.26s -> 8065.26s]  That's what it feels like.
[8065.26s -> 8067.97s]  Okay, sword piece.
[8067.97s -> 8070.40s]  Hold down right bump with the press B.
[8070.40s -> 8078.74s]  Does it have to be the...
[8078.74s -> 8079.74s]  Ooh, okay.
[8079.74s -> 8090.98s]  So it was when I used the B move for this weapon.
[8090.98s -> 8093.54s]  The fire hit somebody and it was...
[8093.54s -> 8095.54s]  All of a sudden the game just started freaking out.
[8095.54s -> 8097.54s]  Almost like the game was lagging.
[8097.54s -> 8098.54s]  Like hardware lag.
[8098.54s -> 8099.54s]  Like, oh, something's fucked up.
[8099.54s -> 8100.54s]  Something's fucked up.
[8100.54s -> 8101.85s]  And then it just...
[8101.85s -> 8114.78s]  It was as if I hit the guy like a thousand times in a row.
[8114.78s -> 8115.78s]  There's the forbidden move.
[8115.78s -> 8118.36s]  It feels like it.
[8118.36s -> 8136.97s]  I'm going to finagle with it.
[8136.97s -> 8137.97s]  The volume will increase.
[8137.97s -> 8141.46s]  I was going to get it to the right spot where it can't go over a certain threshold.
[8141.46s -> 8143.46s]  It was in this room, by the way.
[8143.46s -> 8147.15s]  I'm afraid of this room, but I'm only going to use the nunchucks.
[8147.15s -> 8170.94s]  It was that enemy right there.
[8170.94s -> 8172.94s]  And I did that B move right here.
[8172.94s -> 8175.08s]  I don't know, man.
[8175.08s -> 8176.08s]  I don't know.
[8176.08s -> 8177.08s]  I wish I knew.
[8177.08s -> 8184.27s]  I'm from the future, dude.
[8184.27s -> 8185.27s]  It's going to happen again.
[8185.27s -> 8186.77s]  Don't say that.
[8186.77s -> 8196.78s]  Okay.
[8196.78s -> 8198.02s]  Okay.
[8198.02s -> 8204.29s]  With that being the case, what if I go like this and then like this?
[8204.29s -> 8208.10s]  Technically speaking, I have it set to...
[8208.10s -> 8216.54s]  In the Windows Mixer, Devil May Cry is set to 30% right now.
[8216.54s -> 8224.13s]  So that means that it cannot go over that by the computer's operating system, right?
[8224.13s -> 8233.94s]  No matter what.
[8233.94s -> 8236.59s]  Surely?
[8236.59s -> 8237.59s]  Well, just be aware.
[8237.59s -> 8238.59s]  That could happen again.
[8238.59s -> 8240.59s]  I don't know how or why, but just be aware.
[8240.59s -> 8244.59s]  I would probably watch the stream at fucking 50% volume at least.
[8244.59s -> 8259.78s]  Shit.
[8259.78s -> 8260.78s]  I need to just run.
[8260.78s -> 8261.78s]  Oh, I fucked up again.
[8261.78s -> 8268.38s]  I'm going to have to heal because I really don't want to do this again.
[8268.38s -> 8276.46s]  Where's my...
[8276.46s -> 8277.46s]  Do I even have heals?
[8277.46s -> 8278.46s]  I do.
[8278.46s -> 8280.60s]  Yeah.
[8280.60s -> 8281.60s]  Okay.
[8281.60s -> 8282.60s]  Wait.
[8282.60s -> 8283.60s]  This is the wrong menu.
[8283.60s -> 8284.78s]  What's the right menu?
[8284.78s -> 8287.36s]  Is it down?
[8287.36s -> 8288.36s]  No.
[8288.36s -> 8289.36s]  How do I get to the fucking menu?
[8289.36s -> 8290.36s]  I'm dead.
[8290.36s -> 8303.99s]  I'm so fucked up right now.
[8303.99s -> 8313.25s]  That actually like flash banged me in real life.
[8313.25s -> 8329.32s]  Let me just start it over.
[8329.32s -> 8330.32s]  Come on.
[8330.32s -> 8340.84s]  Kill me already.
[8340.84s -> 8342.84s]  I wish there was base cam for that.
[8342.84s -> 8347.34s]  It would have been awful looking.
[8347.34s -> 8352.34s]  I had my volume so loud too because I was like, yeah, let me rock out to the fucking music.
[8352.34s -> 8353.34s]  Yeah.
[8353.34s -> 8354.34s]  Devil may cry.
[8354.34s -> 8355.34s]  Let's go.
[8355.34s -> 8362.45s]  I just had to walk in that door.
[8362.45s -> 8363.45s]  It just killed me.
[8363.45s -> 8387.06s]  Just got on the fucking switch.
[8387.06s -> 8392.27s]  How was I supposed to know?
[8392.27s -> 8398.27s]  And why do you even have to play that fucking game of merry-go-round when a game comes
[8398.27s -> 8409.38s]  We got like this four or five versions of the game.
[8409.38s -> 8410.38s]  Oh, don't play that one.
[8410.38s -> 8412.56s]  That one's fucked.
[8412.56s -> 8413.56s]  Huh?
[8413.56s -> 8438.33s]  So the audio sounds okay now, right?
[8438.33s -> 8442.85s]  You guys are getting you hearing all the sounds and everything.
[8442.85s -> 8473.86s]  And honestly, I don't even know if that was from the game.
[8473.86s -> 8474.86s]  Who knows?
[8474.86s -> 8477.86s]  Was it a thing like a bug into OBS or my audio equipment?
[8477.86s -> 8480.87s]  Who fucking knows?
[8480.87s -> 8481.87s]  I'm terrified of it happening again.
[8481.87s -> 8526.35s]  It sounded like your mic fell down.
[8526.35s -> 8528.35s]  No, I was just sitting here.
[8528.35s -> 8531.38s]  I was just sitting right here.
[8531.38s -> 8532.38s]  Just playing the game.
[8532.38s -> 8565.88s]  Oh shit.
[8565.88s -> 8591.76s]  Don't die.
[8591.76s -> 8605.67s]  Shit.
[8605.67s -> 8608.51s]  Get back down here, please.
[8608.51s -> 8621.02s]  Shit.
[8621.02s -> 8626.93s]  I'm dead.
[8626.93s -> 8640.52s]  Okay.
[8640.52s -> 8669.47s]  Let's go.
[8669.47s -> 8676.02s]  Why did I wait that long?
[8676.02s -> 8677.02s]  I just wasted that so bad.
[8677.02s -> 8728.70s]  Well, I did it again, but sorry.
[8728.70s -> 8746.83s]  Watch out for the explosion.
[8746.83s -> 8777.54s]  Oh, I'm going to lose it.
[8777.54s -> 8780.54s]  I lose it every time in the last 10 seconds of this fucking fight.
[8780.54s -> 8804.05s]  Why is the game quiet?
[8804.05s -> 8812.51s]  Yeah, somebody somebody somebody tell them I did beat him already, but I had to restart
[8812.51s -> 8815.51s]  the game because I was afraid of something bugging out and fucking up the audio.
[8815.51s -> 8819.29s]  Okay, so I just beat him.
[8819.29s -> 8821.55s]  So now we go down here.
[8821.55s -> 8824.78s]  This is correct, right?
[8824.78s -> 8837.60s]  Here we are here.
[8837.60s -> 8886.82s]  This is a boss boss right after a boss, huh?
[8886.82s -> 8887.82s]  Jesus.
[8887.82s -> 8905.34s]  I wonder if there's a hmm.
[8905.34s -> 8936.75s]  It's just a attack it or oh shit.
[8936.75s -> 8944.33s]  I'm dead.
[8944.33s -> 8951.58s]  I'll be full health now.
[8951.58s -> 8952.58s]  Okay.
[8952.58s -> 8971.23s]  Let's try it again.
[8971.23s -> 8988.41s]  Hmm.
[8988.41s -> 8989.41s]  All right.
[8989.41s -> 9015.67s]  When it's fully charged, you can't do it.
[9015.67s -> 9016.67s]  Whoa.
[9016.67s -> 9022.33s]  Oh, I can't double jump unless it's out.
[9022.33s -> 9023.33s]  He's too.
[9023.33s -> 9037.43s]  Okay.
[9037.43s -> 9075.84s]  Right.
[9075.84s -> 9076.84s]  Hit the carriage or hit the horse.
[9076.84s -> 9079.17s]  He likes the carriage.
[9079.17s -> 9098.71s]  Oh, right here.
[9098.71s -> 9099.71s]  What just happened?
[9099.71s -> 9104.60s]  That's weird.
[9104.60s -> 9105.90s]  Come here.
[9105.90s -> 9129.67s]  Really?
[9129.67s -> 9153.44s]  Please camera.
[9153.44s -> 9155.58s]  Whoa.
[9175.76s -> 9178.60s]  Whoa.
[9178.60s -> 9194.37s]  All right.
[9194.37s -> 9201.56s]  I should get right here.
[9201.56s -> 9202.56s]  Oh, don't blow it right now.
[9202.56s -> 9203.56s]  I could right now.
[9203.56s -> 9222.06s]  Come here.
[9222.06s -> 9223.06s]  Let's just die.
[9223.06s -> 9229.30s]  Oh, oh.
[9229.30s -> 9231.24s]  Okay, please.
[9231.24s -> 9243.74s]  Almost through.
[9243.74s -> 9245.82s]  It was close.
[9245.82s -> 9283.15s]  Almost.
[9283.15s -> 9284.15s]  Why are you being so serious?
[9284.15s -> 9286.16s]  I'll be honest.
[9286.16s -> 9289.06s]  I'm very annoyed.
[9289.06s -> 9296.94s]  I'm very annoyed in real life.
[9296.94s -> 9298.94s]  I'm exceptionally irritated right now.
[9298.94s -> 9303.76s]  All right.
[9303.76s -> 9309.16s]  Quicksilver.
[9309.16s -> 9310.16s]  Is this a new style?
[9310.16s -> 9312.23s]  No, it is a new style.
[9312.23s -> 9326.21s]  Chill out, dude.
[9326.21s -> 9328.58s]  Just move it to easy mode.
[9328.58s -> 9332.16s]  Yeah, I'm just so fucking mad at the game.
[9332.16s -> 9334.16s]  I'm exceptionally irritated right now.
[9334.16s -> 9342.95s]  It's nothing to do with the video game, but it's all good.
[9342.95s -> 9374.08s]  This guy's back?
[9374.08s -> 9403.62s]  Why was it so easy for Virgil and it's so hard for me?
[9403.62s -> 9406.25s]  That makes me scared of Virgil a little more.
[9406.25s -> 9438.42s]  Is the game worth it?
[9438.42s -> 9440.42s]  I mean, I'm having fun with the game, yeah.
[9440.42s -> 9442.56s]  Oh, spoiler.
[9442.56s -> 9448.34s]  That's the first time I've gotten Damage C ever.
[9448.34s -> 9477.17s]  That's pretty good.
[9477.17s -> 9478.17s]  Put the volume back up.
[9478.17s -> 9480.60s]  I think it's safe to put it back.
[9480.60s -> 9489.01s]  I have it in my Windows Mixer all the way down, so I think I can turn it up over here
[9489.01s -> 9506.06s]  and we should be all right.
[9506.06s -> 9508.06s]  You can mod the game so it has style changing.
[9508.06s -> 9509.30s]  I saw that, actually.
[9509.30s -> 9511.30s]  People were talking about that when I first played it.
[9511.30s -> 9517.53s]  I think it's all right for now.
[9517.53s -> 9534.41s]  So this is 13.
[9534.41s -> 9537.71s]  I refilled my drink and I don't even know where it is.
[9537.71s -> 9539.46s]  All right, beer B.
[9539.46s -> 9541.94s]  I need to go pee again.
[9541.94s -> 9544.12s]  I just made a drink and I don't know what to do with it.
[9544.12s -> 9637.20s]  I brought it back.
[9637.20s -> 9639.21s]  All right, I got my drink back.
[9639.21s -> 9640.21s]  It was in the bathroom.
[9640.21s -> 9651.88s]  It was in the bathroom.
[9651.88s -> 9662.57s]  Why was it in the bathroom, you ask?
[9662.57s -> 9666.90s]  Because I went pee and I brought it into the bathroom.
[9666.90s -> 9677.95s]  I thought you were going to restart stream.
[9677.95s -> 9678.95s]  I restarted the game.
[9678.95s -> 9680.26s]  I don't know.
[9680.26s -> 9682.01s]  I don't know.
[9682.01s -> 9684.01s]  I can't give a reason why that happened.
[9684.01s -> 9685.01s]  I really can't.
[9685.01s -> 9687.25s]  Unless it was the game kind of lagged
[9687.25s -> 9689.25s]  and got fucked up in the engine with the...
[9689.25s -> 9690.25s]  I don't know.
[9690.25s -> 9691.81s]  We have to cheer him up.
[9691.81s -> 9692.81s]  No, I'm good.
[9692.81s -> 9693.81s]  I'm just...
[9693.81s -> 9699.06s]  I hate doing that to people more than anything.
[9699.06s -> 9704.18s]  There's a limit to, you know, a loud fucking sound.
[9704.18s -> 9706.86s]  And there's a limit to it, I think.
[9706.86s -> 9708.86s]  Doing that to that many people,
[9708.86s -> 9711.86s]  it really pisses me off that it happened.
[9711.86s -> 9713.17s]  I hate doing that shit.
[9713.17s -> 9717.84s]  You know, like loud sounds like a jump scare.
[9717.84s -> 9718.84s]  Holy shit.
[9718.84s -> 9721.32s]  But that was not good.
[9721.32s -> 9722.32s]  And I fucking hate that.
[9722.32s -> 9725.29s]  So, all right.
[9725.29s -> 9726.85s]  Get it out of my system.
[9726.85s -> 9736.00s]  I got a lot of money.
[9736.00s -> 9739.16s]  It was an hour ago.
[9739.16s -> 9742.16s]  Yeah, but I'm like a won't move on Andy.
[9742.16s -> 9743.16s]  I'm like, fuck.
[9743.16s -> 9745.16s]  I like hate that that happened.
[9745.16s -> 9751.14s]  Seriously, like I'm just like,
[9751.14s -> 9764.49s]  I just wish I could go back and delete it.
[9764.49s -> 9765.49s]  What is this new style?
[9765.49s -> 9768.75s]  I'm controlling style.
[9768.75s -> 9770.06s]  Well, I have to try it.
[9770.06s -> 9775.30s]  I could buy some orbs too.
[9775.30s -> 9780.64s]  I'm doing it.
[9780.64s -> 9788.79s]  What about a gold one?
[9788.79s -> 9797.26s]  No.
[9797.26s -> 9798.95s]  How about blue again?
[9798.95s -> 9799.95s]  Blue again sounds like it's not a bad idea.
[9799.95s -> 9800.95s]  I'll do purple again.
[9800.95s -> 9808.14s]  And I'm going to buy a couple of these.
[9808.14s -> 9809.14s]  I know people are going to be freaking out.
[9809.14s -> 9810.14s]  People say, don't, don't stop, dude.
[9810.14s -> 9811.14s]  What a waste of money.
[9811.14s -> 9820.45s]  It's okay.
[9820.45s -> 9842.04s]  Let's go for it.
[9842.04s -> 9843.04s]  Reset the save file.
[9843.04s -> 9845.05s]  I don't want to do that.
[9845.05s -> 9869.97s]  More?
[9869.97s -> 9894.06s]  Oh, I had a sweet going too.
[9894.06s -> 9895.06s]  You guys ruined everything.
[9895.06s -> 9906.90s]  You should add subway surfers to the corner.
[9906.90s -> 9912.57s]  No, you're not getting subway surfers.
[9912.57s -> 9918.42s]  Am I going the wrong way?
[9918.42s -> 9936.55s]  Was I going the right way?
[9936.55s -> 9941.18s]  I don't know.
[9941.18s -> 9943.06s]  Was I going the right way?
[9943.06s -> 9951.41s]  What about family guy moments?
[9951.41s -> 9952.41s]  No.
[9952.41s -> 9978.99s]  Long staircase.
[9978.99s -> 9979.99s]  Hell's highway.
[9979.99s -> 9989.87s]  How do I get in there?
[9989.87s -> 9990.87s]  There's a blue orb in there.
[9990.87s -> 9992.30s]  How do I open that?
[9992.30s -> 10004.98s]  It feels like mom yelled at us for being too loud and now we're scared.
[10004.98s -> 10010.74s]  The universe just likes to make jokes on my behalf, right?
[10010.74s -> 10015.94s]  An hour before that, two hours before that happened, what did I say?
[10015.94s -> 10018.48s]  What did we talk about very specifically?
[10018.48s -> 10020.48s]  It was incredibly specific.
[10020.48s -> 10021.48s]  What was it?
[10021.48s -> 10027.42s]  It was about audio and how important it is to have proper audio levels.
[10028.42s -> 10035.66s]  And you're telling me that you're telling me that I may have witnessed a like rare one
[10035.66s -> 10042.22s]  in a billion chance bug to create an environment that makes them.
[10042.22s -> 10043.22s]  Huh?
[10043.22s -> 10045.85s]  Today, after talking about audio levels.
[10045.85s -> 10046.85s]  Why?
[10046.85s -> 10067.62s]  That's a protagonist dilemma.
[10067.62s -> 10073.19s]  Protagonist dilemma.
[10073.19s -> 10074.19s]  Oh, no.
[10074.19s -> 10090.28s]  Here comes a tournament arc.
[10090.28s -> 10091.28s]  Oh, dear.
[10091.28s -> 10104.68s]  Okay.
[10104.68s -> 10121.22s]  All right.
[10121.22s -> 10122.22s]  I got that wrong.
[10122.22s -> 10134.21s]  Let's reset it.
[10134.21s -> 10145.88s]  Reset.
[10145.88s -> 10148.88s]  Delete the explosion sound effect in the game folder.
[10148.88s -> 10165.04s]  God, I got it all wrong.
[10165.04s -> 10191.09s]  I mean, so very clearly has to go this way and work backwards.
[10191.09s -> 10193.33s]  It has to go through here.
[10193.33s -> 10196.70s]  So this can't exist up from here.
[10196.70s -> 10197.70s]  How does it go this way?
[10197.70s -> 10203.36s]  Unless it has to go.
[10203.36s -> 10225.86s]  No, I can't go from this one to this one.
[10225.86s -> 10226.86s]  Like that.
[10226.86s -> 10227.86s]  It can't be that one.
[10227.86s -> 10234.54s]  Right.
[10234.54s -> 10237.54s]  How do I get it to hit this one here to go up?
[10237.54s -> 10252.10s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[10252.10s -> 10253.10s]  What is it going?
[10253.10s -> 10254.10s]  What is going on right now?
[10254.10s -> 10260.78s]  Wait, what?
[10260.78s -> 10265.15s]  Okay.
[10269.14s -> 10271.86s]  I got it.
[10271.86s -> 10285.59s]  Again, if it was the case of I didn't even know this room existed.
[10285.59s -> 10286.59s]  Okay.
[10286.59s -> 10291.18s]  Wait, is this first part just bait?
[10291.18s -> 10293.18s]  Or can you actually do this part?
[10293.18s -> 10295.58s]  So this is bait.
[10295.58s -> 10301.55s]  Huh.
[10301.55s -> 10302.73s]  That's funny.
[10302.73s -> 10306.93s]  I would have sat here for a long time if I did not see the shadow over there.
[10306.93s -> 10307.93s]  All right.
[10307.93s -> 10316.91s]  So I got that.
[10316.91s -> 10348.74s]  Do it again.
[10348.74s -> 10349.74s]  Go on.
[10349.74s -> 10370.12s]  Swing.
[10370.12s -> 10383.26s]  Oh, that hurt.
[10383.26s -> 10389.69s]  I haven't any money.
[10389.69s -> 10394.83s]  No, but I just bought stuff, so I'm good.
[10394.83s -> 10395.83s]  So where are we now?
[10395.83s -> 10399.42s]  Okay.
[10399.42s -> 10404.38s]  It's time.
[10404.38s -> 10409.65s]  What's in here?
[10409.65s -> 10413.14s]  Frogs having sex in the pond and they're loud in front of you.
[10413.14s -> 10414.14s]  How is there someone?
[10414.14s -> 10415.14s]  What?
[10415.14s -> 10416.14s]  What was the person talking about?
[10462.79s -> 10463.79s]  Another verse.
[10463.79s -> 10464.79s]  Oh, sorry.
[10464.79s -> 10465.79s]  Okay.
[10465.79s -> 10474.05s]  Read genuine advice.
[10474.05s -> 10476.05s]  No, read frog sex.
[10476.05s -> 10477.05s]  Yes.
[10484.22s -> 10501.03s]  Okay, here we go.
[10501.03s -> 10505.06s]  Dante versus Virgil.
[10505.06s -> 10510.16s]  You could see this exclusive battle.
[10510.16s -> 10519.54s]  Only you pre-order the game now and get the Dante versus Virgil DLC pack included in every copy from pre-orders.
[10519.54s -> 10543.88s]  Okay.
[10543.88s -> 10544.88s]  Well, I didn't make no help.
[10544.88s -> 10554.80s]  It's the first real attempt.
[10554.80s -> 10558.79s]  Ow.
[10558.79s -> 10576.72s]  Come on.
[10576.72s -> 10583.08s]  Shit.
[10583.08s -> 10584.38s]  Weird move set.
[10584.38s -> 10601.69s]  Oh, what's this?
[10601.69s -> 10604.70s]  Is he going devil mode?
[10604.70s -> 10606.77s]  Devil mode?
[10606.77s -> 10615.82s]  Jesus.
[10615.82s -> 10624.99s]  Ow.
[10624.99s -> 10626.99s]  I feel like I'm playing Street Fighter.
[10626.99s -> 10627.99s]  I'm still caught in a combo.
[10627.99s -> 10649.94s]  No, I can't move.
[10649.94s -> 10657.39s]  Okay.
[10657.39s -> 10660.40s]  So if you get hit, he's going to hit you four times in a row.
[10660.40s -> 10661.40s]  Don't get hit.
[10661.40s -> 10691.50s]  Got it.
[10691.50s -> 10692.50s]  All right.
[10692.50s -> 10694.50s]  I'm going to wait to go demon mode until you go demon mode.
[10694.50s -> 10695.50s]  That makes more sense to me.
[10695.50s -> 10716.14s]  That hurts.
[10716.14s -> 10724.93s]  Sorry.
[10724.93s -> 10725.93s]  Well, I did it earlier.
[10725.93s -> 10726.93s]  It's okay.
[10726.93s -> 10741.54s]  All right.
[10741.54s -> 10758.02s]  So you just got to avoid it.
[10758.02s -> 10759.96s]  I got it.
[10759.96s -> 10760.96s]  Come on.
[10765.98s -> 10766.98s]  Oh, my God.
[10766.98s -> 10767.98s]  When you get caught in that, it's over.
[10767.98s -> 10786.05s]  Oh, my God.
[10786.05s -> 10789.67s]  I have like four frames to hit you with anything.
[10789.67s -> 10793.90s]  You just block it.
[10793.90s -> 10817.60s]  We're going back here.
[10817.60s -> 10823.13s]  I wonder if I should put...
[10823.13s -> 10826.78s]  No, I like these swords.
[10826.78s -> 10834.33s]  They're leveled up high, too.
[10834.33s -> 10840.05s]  Regular sword, maybe.
[10840.05s -> 10850.07s]  I haven't used this weapon in a very long time.
[10850.07s -> 10856.98s]  Can I upgrade it?
[10856.98s -> 10865.56s]  I don't even have air hike for it, though.
[10865.56s -> 10870.10s]  Turn up your microphone.
[10870.10s -> 10875.52s]  My microphone has been the same for like five years.
[10875.52s -> 10905.62s]  I'll try it.
[10905.62s -> 10909.36s]  Much better.
[10909.36s -> 10910.36s]  Yeah.
[10910.36s -> 10915.25s]  I'm just going to run from you now.
[10915.25s -> 10919.18s]  Fuck you.
[10919.18s -> 10926.05s]  Come get me.
[10926.05s -> 10927.05s]  Coward.
[10927.05s -> 10928.05s]  I can't hurt him right now.
[10928.05s -> 10929.05s]  Yeah, I'm a coward right now.
[10929.05s -> 10955.31s]  That's fine.
[10955.31s -> 10956.31s]  Whoa.
[10956.31s -> 10959.15s]  Whoa.
[10959.15s -> 10972.42s]  You transformed and I didn't?
[10972.42s -> 10985.50s]  Fine.
[10985.50s -> 10986.50s]  Let's go.
[10986.50s -> 10994.78s]  Oh, shit.
[10994.78s -> 11011.58s]  No, dude.
[11011.58s -> 11019.73s]  Come on, please.
[11019.73s -> 11025.32s]  Epic.
[11025.32s -> 11028.61s]  No, that was bad.
[11028.61s -> 11029.61s]  Get away from me.
[11029.61s -> 11030.61s]  I taunted, too.
[11030.61s -> 11031.61s]  You baited a taunt, you asshole.
[11031.61s -> 11035.86s]  God damn it.
[11035.86s -> 11036.86s]  No, don't.
[11036.86s -> 11041.04s]  Wait.
[11041.04s -> 11042.04s]  Heal.
[11042.04s -> 11068.69s]  What button is it?
[11068.69s -> 11069.69s]  Up.
[11069.69s -> 11070.93s]  What is this horse shit?
[11070.93s -> 11071.93s]  Now with 10% health left.
[11071.93s -> 11114.06s]  Don't.
[11114.06s -> 11122.79s]  Oh, no.
[11122.79s -> 11123.79s]  Shit.
[11123.79s -> 11126.63s]  No.
[11126.63s -> 11127.63s]  God damn it.
[11127.63s -> 11128.63s]  I had it, too.
[11128.63s -> 11131.52s]  You fucking dickhead.
[11131.52s -> 11132.52s]  You dick.
[11132.52s -> 11133.52s]  I got caught in a combo.
[11133.52s -> 11134.52s]  If you get caught in the combo, he's going to do like three bubbles.
[11134.52s -> 11135.52s]  Fuck.
[11135.52s -> 11136.52s]  I can do it, too.
[11136.52s -> 11137.52s]  All right.
[11137.52s -> 11138.52s]  That was better.
[11138.52s -> 11139.52s]  That was cleaner.
[11139.52s -> 11141.72s]  Don't even think about it.
[11141.72s -> 11142.72s]  Did we both do it at the same time again?
[11142.72s -> 11143.72s]  Goodbye.
[11143.72s -> 11144.72s]  Oh, Virgil.
[11144.72s -> 11145.72s]  Look out for Virgil.
[11145.72s -> 11175.12s]  Get out of here.
[11175.12s -> 11205.54s]  Fuck you for doing that with low volume.
[11205.54s -> 11219.84s]  You don't understand.
[11219.84s -> 11220.84s]  Oh.
[11220.84s -> 11292.99s]  Don't even think about it. Did we both do it at the same time again? Goodbye. Yeah. Come here. Oh
[11309.12s -> 11331.77s]  Virgil look out for Virgil get out of here
[11349.36s -> 11356.81s]  Fuck you for doing that with low volume. You don't understand
[11416.28s -> 11420.87s]  Now leave
[11420.87s -> 11423.75s]  That was close
[11423.75s -> 11427.11s]  But you've taken quite a trouncing today haven't you Virgil?
[11427.11s -> 11431.75s]  You could have chopped me into confetti by now if you were in tip-top condition
[11431.75s -> 11433.75s]  Damn you
[11433.75s -> 11441.67s]  You have lost
[11441.67s -> 11443.67s]  Because you underestimated humans
[11443.67s -> 11445.67s]  Wait what?
[11445.67s -> 11450.22s]  What's going on?
[11450.22s -> 11452.65s]  Pure and innocent
[11452.65s -> 11458.65s]  Just like you
[11458.65s -> 11466.84s]  You're spanking my dear
[11472.39s -> 11481.27s]  Somebody said how many people are in this room? Yeah, there's a lot of people in this room right now that weren't here
[11528.90s -> 11531.14s]  The fuck
[11536.33s -> 11538.33s]  Quite a ride, you know
[11539.35s -> 11544.09s]  If any of you had died before getting here our little can would have gone waste
[11545.66s -> 11549.42s]  Therefore my job was to make you battle each other in order to weaken you
[11549.98s -> 11555.40s]  But at the same time guide you here and make sure that you were kept alive
[11556.04s -> 11559.02s]  I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot
[11563.14s -> 11565.14s]  It's time for bed Mary
[11565.78s -> 11568.02s]  You can visit your dear mother
[11580.04s -> 11588.26s]  It's time for the clown to bow out Darkum dude the show's over impressive
[11589.78s -> 11593.00s]  I expected nothing less from the devil's descendants
[11596.44s -> 11609.26s]  Why does he keep laughing then he's like I had to wear this ridiculous costume
[11612.39s -> 11664.34s]  Like you don't have to laugh anymore damn, okay. Yes. Oh
[11670.63s -> 11716.92s]  It's pretty ugly. All right, that's pretty ugly. Where are we going?
[11717.40s -> 11758.71s]  We're going up to become a god
[11758.71s -> 11773.18s]  So are we heading into the final arc of the game the last like five or six chapters, right the third act nice
[11773.50s -> 11817.46s]  I think we're safe to turn the game back up. Honestly, i'm i'm not using that style move for the devil swords, though
[11817.70s -> 11837.70s]  That's the move that I did getting lured into a false sense of security. Oh, no, it doesn't say that
[11854.39s -> 11858.06s]  All right
[11858.06s -> 11867.75s]  So let's try this because I want to see it. I want to
[11869.66s -> 11878.57s]  I can keep these although maybe I like that better and then what do I got 12 000?
[11878.97s -> 11883.13s]  What about one of these holy waters? No, no, no, no, you know what?
[11885.14s -> 11903.40s]  Fuck it. I'm gonna do it through here. I'm gonna let me just do one quick thing
[11909.40s -> 11920.47s]  one quick thing let's go with that and
[11926.57s -> 11939.90s]  See how that works. Does this sound better? Is it a little louder? I think it can stay right here. Is that better?
[11946.84s -> 11958.33s]  So the idea is I turned a certain uh setting on too over here just in case this dude is paranoid
[11958.49s -> 11963.59s]  Yeah, it's I am super paranoid sacred light
[11966.90s -> 11971.06s]  Sacred light do I have that?
[11971.06s -> 11985.90s]  What's that flash gauntlets and greaves that said boost dante's attack and speed making him well good thing
[11985.90s -> 11994.95s]  I picked these up. I almost just walked completely away from this. This is a weapon
[11999.08s -> 12012.44s]  Really?
[12012.44s -> 12020.54s]  Uh, so that's definitely for that. So where's that thing? Wasn't there one of those thingies here?
[12020.70s -> 12055.45s]  The baowolf this is what Virgil was using. Okay, cool. Okay, so you can hold it. Okay, each one can be held. What about
[12056.41s -> 12071.80s]  Upgrading it beast uppercut great level two. Let's actually take a look. I want to see the um, what can it do?
[12077.22s -> 12082.18s]  You know, why why why what I just did this one is why why pause why why?
[12083.94s -> 12126.34s]  Oh there hyper fist. Okay. Yep. So why why pause why why go I like it? I'm a fan
[12134.82s -> 12156.42s]  Why pause nice? Yeah, there's a dive kick. It's crazy
[12156.82s -> 12171.42s]  Charging does stupid damage. Oh, i'm gonna have fun with it. There's one door through here. Pretty cool
[12171.66s -> 12191.11s]  Is there anything else? It's a nice weapon for sure. We're about to test it probably right now. Yep. Okay
[12191.51s -> 12208.15s]  I got that and let's go this way. Can you do your own demon boss voice? Yeah, I will I will do
[12208.79s -> 12210.63s]  the next uh boss
[12210.63s -> 12241.43s]  I'll do all of their dialogue and you better believe it's going to be low pitched with a filter on it
[12241.43s -> 12290.87s]  That's like this sounds kind of sounds like this get off the wall. Stop turtling. Okay. Where's that door? Where's that door?
[12291.19s -> 12333.78s]  Didn't I just come from here? Yeah. No, I did I Jesus even that was loud. Are you gonna do the food thing?
[12334.58s -> 12339.27s]  Yeah, we'll take a break. Uh, we'll do the food. I I got the compilation of the data
[12356.46s -> 12368.78s]  Okay. Whoa
[12368.78s -> 12373.42s]  You so you stop time. Ah now I see why people were saying this is the best move in the game
[12399.02s -> 12427.06s]  Shit, I don't like when they block. It's really expensive on btd. Is it?
[12427.70s -> 12448.76s]  Can I do anything else here? I wonder
[12451.30s -> 12462.25s]  No, I just did it. Ooh
[12462.65s -> 12471.70s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, there was some oh crap. I feel like I missed there was another way to go
[12471.78s -> 12485.27s]  Go over there. I think there was right god. Damn it. It's doing this. Okay, it's
[12509.76s -> 12530.42s]  Restock restock. Okay. So I wonder if you get it wrong. Do you have to do it again?
[12530.58s -> 12555.50s]  How much is a fully charged punch? Do I wonder the dive kick is really good, too
[12555.90s -> 12578.82s]  All right, it's it slows down your play style a little bit. I don't I can't say I love it
[12579.30s -> 12583.21s]  i'm a lot used to uh spinning around with the
[12584.39s -> 12613.54s]  Nunchucks, all right. So which way do I actually want to go here this way? All right swing swing
[12613.94s -> 12626.58s]  Okay. Well, never mind. The dive kick is the best part
[12647.74s -> 12650.49s]  Everything's open now. Um
[12650.73s -> 12683.58s]  Anything special I have to do. What do I do? This is the only one that's not open
[12683.82s -> 12710.12s]  This is not open just leave go out the door like just like just leave leave. Oh, there is a door
[12710.44s -> 12720.50s]  Is this I don't know what i'm going. This is wrong. Isn't it? I I don't know what's going on. Oh, I found it
[12751.91s -> 12757.59s]  Back up watch out food mode. I don't know if this would be a good food mode candidate
[12766.36s -> 12769.26s]  No, I don't think so
[12769.26s -> 12771.66s]  This this would be pretty low on the scale for food mode
[12771.98s -> 12795.69s]  I feel like the food mode computer would be would do way worse than me. Okay. So where are we now interesting?
[12804.26s -> 12814.95s]  I'm saving money. I've used way too much on purple orbs. But what is anything here? I can do
[12815.27s -> 12869.85s]  I feel like this moves. I have no idea. Oh, okay. What's the end goal?
[12869.93s -> 12876.38s]  Where am I trying to go? He went up in the sky and then it was like, okay now
[12877.90s -> 12898.58s]  Oh, I think over there. This looks like I can go up the love planet. What the hell is this?
[12902.31s -> 12923.56s]  Wait, no, this is back. I think I made it any secrets. No, can't use those. All right. Goodbye
[12923.88s -> 12968.46s]  Okay, am I going back to the very beginning of the game? Yeah, this is like the first area dante's office gold orb
[12976.97s -> 13030.41s]  Wait, no this way. There's kill them. All right, die. How come he hasn't left the starting area since yesterday? I've just been
[13031.13s -> 13038.12s]  I don't understand guys. I keep killing the same enemies. I don't get it. Where am I supposed to go from here? I don't understand it
[13043.48s -> 13058.86s]  It's two
[13058.86s -> 13063.66s]  Dude, oh
[13063.66s -> 13086.81s]  Get behind. Oh, no. I'm not doing this whole thing again. No way
[13087.29s -> 13126.60s]  Why do you have 5 000 times more hp than usual? You die already
[13140.94s -> 13156.33s]  Cool. So is it nothing here? I guess I don't understand. I didn't accomplish anything
[13180.89s -> 13195.18s]  What is my goal right now to get to the top of the tower?
[13214.20s -> 13252.33s]  Hmm, there's another door in here. Where's this other door? Where is this other door under the stairs?
[13257.34s -> 13260.86s]  Oh, this is I didn't even this blended in with the environment. I couldn't see this
[13261.18s -> 13324.02s]  Do you get to ride the motorcycle? That'd be awesome
[13324.26s -> 13365.67s]  You should get to keep that and use that as a melee weapon. What were they thinking?
[13370.22s -> 13374.49s]  t s d c
[13375.54s -> 13427.56s]  No, I want to seize across the board. Oh, well the gate crusher control the tower control your destiny
[13432.22s -> 13434.22s]  You still are you still mad about the audio thing?
[13435.90s -> 13454.92s]  I was just I still fuming like an hour and 45 minutes later. No, i'm, all right. I'm, all right
[13455.16s -> 13477.22s]  How about a beard cam?
[13488.23s -> 13489.54s]  No
[13489.54s -> 13516.66s]  Sorry, I was reading something. Sorry. I'm reading something. I'm not i'm promise i'm reading i'm not reading a guide
[13516.66s -> 13537.24s]  I promise i'm not reading a guide. All right, i'm not reading a guide. I i just looked up tips and tricks for
[13537.72s -> 13557.70s]  Uh chapter 15. That's all I did. Hello. Oh, it's a mini boss
[13564.28s -> 13591.77s]  Hmm, oh shit two mini bosses you guys are kind of annoying
[13601.66s -> 13647.83s]  Get over here. Oh these things suck. I hate having to jump to enemies and do one move. Oh spiders
[13675.77s -> 13703.10s]  Don't die. Come here. Oh my why do they have to run away? Does every enemy run away in this game?
[13703.34s -> 13709.34s]  They all just like go far away from you. That's a sin. Stop
[13720.58s -> 13723.13s]  You don't whoa
[13723.13s -> 13725.13s]  You don't level up quicksilver. Okay
[13727.11s -> 13729.13s]  I should take it off
[13729.13s -> 13731.93s]  What is happening to my character right now?
[13746.30s -> 13764.12s]  Okay, is this it there are three indentations. Okay, this is definitely it say the line
[13764.28s -> 13788.81s]  What's which what line you want me to say? The secret's up there. Oh, you want me to say the enemy spider line
[13792.28s -> 13815.19s]  I can do that. Welcome go that way. I just came from that way an energy source has been activated
[13815.59s -> 13862.86s]  Large snapping sound like two parts locking together can be heard from beyond the wall. I don't think I'd do anything with that. Okay
[13864.30s -> 13873.19s]  Um
[13873.19s -> 13893.08s]  I don't get it
[13893.08s -> 13897.58s]  Was there something else in this room that I wasn't part of the fucking right camera angle?
[13897.66s -> 13922.46s]  So I had to I have to look at it from a different angle or something. What is this? Is this just a object?
[13933.40s -> 13941.83s]  No, there's nowhere to go. Yeah, I see these two doors, but I don't have the device to turn this on
[13947.83s -> 13975.50s]  Re-indentations, what is this? A massive force is shaking the tower. Have you ever eaten cat food before? No, dude
[13975.82s -> 13985.27s]  I can't say I have what are you distracted me? What what just what just even happened a loud sound was heard
[13986.89s -> 14013.19s]  No, I haven't eaten cat food before did this move or change or no? I don't think so. Oh, okay
[14019.66s -> 14034.39s]  Now this is moving. Oh shit. I want those give it. I want those things over there. I'm gonna get them
[14034.47s -> 14055.62s]  This will be interesting. Okay, the whole tower is
[14056.24s -> 14061.48s]  Rotating. All right back up. Where's that door?
[14066.52s -> 14070.54s]  Oh, no
[14070.54s -> 14084.12s]  No, not right now. That would be a mistake to do it here. Did it count? It counted. Oh jeez
[14086.30s -> 14090.58s]  Uh, i'm making it
[14119.72s -> 14138.47s]  That's fine. He's ignoring us. What do you mean? All right. Now I go back
[14139.03s -> 14159.24s]  Does that open this?
[14159.24s -> 14162.84s]  You're not nice. How do you get over this shit reliably?
[14185.62s -> 14197.58s]  12 000 I could do i'm gonna save it because I want to get do I want to upgrade the beowulf or not?
[14197.82s -> 14219.94s]  I think I actually might just I like the regular sword a lot. Beowulf does a ton of damage though
[14221.54s -> 14260.90s]  I'll i'll do it. I'll do it. I'm gonna get the um, i'm gonna get beast uppercut. So here we are
[14262.58s -> 14263.94s]  Activate this last one
[14263.94s -> 14279.66s]  It does it does so much damage though. You guys are right. All right now back in here say the line small
[14280.22s -> 14284.31s]  Or large giant enemy spider. There you go
[14286.63s -> 14302.25s]  This path leads back to the human world to enter the demon world one must proceed towards the heavens from the central route
[14312.70s -> 14352.46s]  Oh back down here. I think this is right. Yeah, one of these yeah, this is definitely it. All right
[14352.62s -> 14370.66s]  Let's test our new move. Never mind. I'm watching the broken audio clip. It's making me literally ache from laughing
[14372.06s -> 14380.23s]  Well, i'm really glad that you think that i'm glad that you think that i'm still very upset that it happened though
[14381.50s -> 14382.86s]  It aches
[14382.86s -> 14384.86s]  At least as long as somebody
[14386.82s -> 14388.18s]  Okay, I
[14388.18s -> 14397.82s]  Am I supposed to do that?
[14397.82s -> 14399.82s]  My chest hurts from laughing at it
[14401.98s -> 14403.98s]  It sucked it was so bad
[14409.62s -> 14411.62s]  That was exploded I
[14412.58s -> 14418.98s]  I can't man
[14419.30s -> 14422.06s]  That sucks
[14428.66s -> 14434.90s]  Oh nice
[14434.90s -> 14436.90s]  The important thing is we all had fun
[14437.54s -> 14440.04s]  And that is very important to me
[14440.12s -> 14459.05s]  Is this right?
[14459.05s -> 14462.22s]  No, is it right?
[14462.22s -> 14464.90s]  I have to go up the tower
[14464.90s -> 14466.90s]  Maybe it is right. No, it's not
[14469.38s -> 14471.69s]  Is it
[14471.69s -> 14476.73s]  Isn't so how do I scale the tower?
[14477.62s -> 14490.87s]  Find out this guy is this guy is actually this bad
[14494.09s -> 14497.53s]  Dude, I know you've probably played this game like 30 times already
[14498.49s -> 14515.58s]  I don't know where the hell i'm going
[14515.58s -> 14517.67s]  So I have to go down
[14517.67s -> 14519.67s]  There has to be a way to go inside
[14519.67s -> 14541.54s]  Or maybe not. Okay
[14542.22s -> 14544.22s]  Um, did I go in here?
[14544.46s -> 14548.78s]  How many okay?
[14548.78s -> 14550.78s]  Where the fuck do I even go?
[14551.61s -> 14553.61s]  Can I get in here somehow?
[14553.93s -> 14572.06s]  This is one of the most confusing missions in the entire series to be honest, if not the most
[14573.54s -> 14574.66s]  um
[14574.66s -> 14575.86s]  Oh, okay
[14575.86s -> 14588.42s]  I mean i'm assuming I have to go up the tower because that's where he went
[14592.30s -> 14598.68s]  He went up
[14598.68s -> 14603.64s]  I went that way. I'm gonna go the other way. It's not something to do with this, right?
[14604.28s -> 14627.69s]  Okay, I have no idea
[14627.69s -> 14631.99s]  I feel like i'm close to being in the right spot, but not really
[14632.55s -> 14639.50s]  This is the only logical way, right?
[14644.31s -> 14649.69s]  This I wish I could delete these enemies from the game and just go in the code and do it myself
[14656.14s -> 14657.42s]  It's obvious
[14657.42s -> 14659.18s]  I feel like it's not
[14659.18s -> 14673.45s]  That's not a door. I guess i'm just gonna go
[14674.33s -> 14676.33s]  but this takes me back to the
[14676.66s -> 14683.27s]  first area
[14683.27s -> 14684.87s]  I'm going back to the
[14684.87s -> 14702.25s]  The first part of the game. What the fuck am I supposed to do here? Maybe i'm supposed to go back that way
[14702.65s -> 14710.20s]  Go back to the spider room
[14714.26s -> 14716.76s]  really
[14716.76s -> 14717.80s]  um
[14717.80s -> 14722.44s]  Okay to change gears maybe I guess
[14736.71s -> 14770.82s]  All right, i'm going back to the spider room. Okay back here. This is actually pretty far back
[14771.06s -> 14782.50s]  Okay, so I have the was it like a crab in the bottom bird mushroom at the top right?
[14782.82s -> 14790.76s]  Okay, red purple and blue and what what side do they have to be on spin it again?
[14791.00s -> 14804.94s]  Okay, so this is blue in the top left. Is that correct?
[14812.47s -> 14823.34s]  There's a couple of sections in the top left that didn't go to you
[14823.34s -> 14826.06s]  They kind of got to eat corn a corn one corn of kernel at a time
[14826.30s -> 14838.62s]  I spoon the whole thing in my mouth bro. Okay, this is apparently correct
[14839.10s -> 14885.26s]  Or different somehow. I think it's different enough. Like we're doing this again. I'm gonna die. Oh shit
[14885.34s -> 14902.02s]  We're even all right. Where how far back is this? This is really far back. Oh, no, it's not right. Where am I?
[14904.04s -> 14917.80s]  No, no, no, this is this is this is lit up. It didn't make any progress progress at all. So it's fine
[14921.18s -> 14924.94s]  I almost like want to just have chat tell me exactly what door to go in
[14925.02s -> 14929.42s]  We've we've done that before. I don't know if I want to walk in circles for the next hour
[14932.41s -> 14939.45s]  All right, so does position matters here blue is in the top left purple in the bottom
[14939.45s -> 14941.85s]  This is where it was before I hit this and I spun it again
[14954.89s -> 14961.30s]  Now purple is in top left. Do I not hit it again?
[14961.70s -> 14983.72s]  I could just I wonder maybe red in the top left. It is not about rotation. You need to explore man
[14983.80s -> 14989.72s]  Okay. Well, where does this take me? I remember this part
[14991.58s -> 15009.85s]  Uh, well, I guess i'm just gonna try to go through here because I did this last time. So where does this go?
[15010.49s -> 15033.06s]  Did not see this yet. I didn't make it past geez. Don't do any more sound effects shit
[15033.64s -> 15045.93s]  That that was queuing up a sound effect. All right, so this part I have two of these now
[15061.54s -> 15072.26s]  All right, so there's top left area and then top right so I think I have to just go that way
[15072.58s -> 15083.96s]  So i'm gonna try to get to the top right area. You missed one of the rotations
[15084.52s -> 15092.26s]  It's gonna put blue in the top left
[15092.34s -> 15105.70s]  Okay, so now this is blue
[15114.78s -> 15116.78s]  Oh my god, leave me alone
[15118.41s -> 15120.41s]  Uh, can I even get back up?
[15120.65s -> 15123.42s]  How do I get back up there?
[15123.42s -> 15126.81s]  Like you guys are so fucking annoying

[15226.68s -> 15228.74s]  Come on
[15228.74s -> 15230.82s]  Why can I not jump over this?
[15231.30s -> 15233.30s]  It's fucking horseshit
[15249.30s -> 15252.90s]  All right. I need to go in here because I have not technically gone in here
[15257.00s -> 15258.14s]  Okay

[15327.13s -> 15352.06s]  Okay, and go I can always I can do it this way, but not the other way for some reason
[15371.69s -> 15373.13s]  Okay

[16410.73s -> 16413.77s]  Yeah, but I didn't I everybody told me that this doesn't matter
[16414.49s -> 16417.56s]  Does it matter people? I I don't know whether to trust this or not
[16417.64s -> 16419.64s]  People said that mid mission doesn't really do anything doesn't it?
[16424.63s -> 16434.26s]  I was told never to use that it doesn't checkpoint, but it does save
[16434.34s -> 16461.75s]  Okay, I don't have to fight I can get the cutscene from the main menu
[16462.07s -> 16521.51s]  All right. We actually have to fight now. I feel like it's been an hour since I've attacked an enemy come here already dead
[16521.59s -> 16543.22s]  Okay, cool. Hey dude, can you discharge a firearm or do your red explosive barrel again? It was really funny the first time
[16544.50s -> 16549.22s]  God damn it. I don't want to be the guy that's known as the loud guy. Oh, I already am
[16558.20s -> 16603.91s]  All right, let's get out of here. This thing's a lot lighter. No
[16604.55s -> 16647.22s]  Is it gone

[16819.40s -> 16836.22s]  Oh, there's plenty of places I haven't gone
[16836.54s -> 16848.44s]  The question is what door should I go in next i'm gonna say I have to go this way back into the
[16850.82s -> 16855.38s]  What's in here? Okay, so I gotta go all the way to the end
[16871.54s -> 16891.35s]  Now I need to go either one of these doors works. How much money do I have not enough dante versus deadpool who wins
[16891.67s -> 16896.42s]  It's an easy one
[16896.42s -> 16964.58s]  Uh, probably dante. All right. Good. All right. I gotta kill this guy now. He's annoying. Where are you?
[16964.82s -> 17012.38s]  Have you been spawning people devil star? Ooh, all right, anything else in here? Okay
[17014.34s -> 17029.21s]  So there's another door on the end here wait over here. So this is here
[17030.65s -> 17041.91s]  All right. I want to go back and then go to the end of this hole chamber of sin
[17042.39s -> 17051.94s]  He who pursues the onyx moon shard make whole the spheres. I want that
[17075.35s -> 17146.38s]  Okay, so I don't think you break these bounce into each other. Oh shit right when it went down. What the fuck
[17161.66s -> 17169.88s]  Ah, ah, huh? They're touching. Why are they not breaking into each other?
[17184.92s -> 17198.31s]  Ah, yes, I did it moon shard cool
[17228.82s -> 17236.65s]  Dude, you I I I hate these things. You are so fucking annoying
[17244.12s -> 17248.54s]  What is i'm gonna lose?
[17248.78s -> 17271.88s]  Okay, well at least I don't have to do this again
[17282.14s -> 17287.40s]  I'm just gonna do this because I refuse to fight these enemies. I refuse
[17288.12s -> 17311.56s]  Spam the air kick. Um, that's what I tried to start doing
[17313.03s -> 17352.71s]  But they just float around so much. You can't even get like a fucking line on them. Why can these enemies fly?
[17367.61s -> 17369.61s]  You and you shouldn't be able to go in the ground
[17373.88s -> 17375.88s]  Bro fight me out of the fucking puddle
[17406.87s -> 17425.67s]  Now I want to go around the corner and down when you're gonna start the granny game marathon
[17425.91s -> 17474.14s]  The uh, we were here before the ice guardians chamber, but what's going on?
[17474.54s -> 17488.84s]  Do I have any thoughts on what do more attacks than the spinning jump one? I don't but
[17489.77s -> 17491.72s]  It's okay
[17491.72s -> 17498.22s]  This game when you move forward and press attack you do that move. You have to stand completely still which
[17499.16s -> 17501.58s]  Retraining your brain to not have your thumb on the stick
[17502.30s -> 17529.26s]  Very hard. I mean there's a door here. I just tried to do that
[17563.67s -> 17569.62s]  Nowhere. Hey, dude, you're gonna finish mafia 3
[17573.72s -> 17598.50s]  Damn, that's enough. That's an old one. I played mafia 3 for like three hours or something dinner giant walker chamber
[17598.82s -> 17624.41s]  Yeah, we're really going kind of through the whole first part of the game. Hey, here we are
[17625.75s -> 17640.92s]  This thing is moving now. I gotta build up some more
[17641.48s -> 17663.53s]  Souls here. Okay, so this thing's moving any weird shit up here or anything
[17665.43s -> 17702.33s]  No, okay, leave one other way to go stand back the hell you can't do something you can reason with
[17703.48s -> 17706.44s]  It has nothing to do with me being a human and you being a demon
[17708.15s -> 17713.98s]  I'm driven inability to forgive him. My soul is screaming demanding me to kill him
[17715.02s -> 17718.81s]  That's enough motivation to keep me going
[17722.26s -> 17725.86s]  Besides, this is my family matter. You should stay out of it
[17726.74s -> 17731.88s]  Okay, lady, I get them. I can't just sit back and watch either
[17732.73s -> 17743.24s]  I'm pretty pissed at him too. You know now get out of my way or there'll be some consequences fair enough
[17744.20s -> 17746.60s]  I wasn't planning on letting any demons. Uh-oh
[17747.24s -> 17749.24s]  I'm gonna get my ass kicked. Aren't I?
[17749.24s -> 17774.82s]  All right, first try let me do it. I'll get it first try where she's freaking me out

[18355.27s -> 18358.92s]  God damn it
[18358.92s -> 18367.19s]  It's just I looked over at the mod chat and I just see mischief makers. Did I win? Oh shit
[18377.24s -> 18400.44s]  All right. Cool. Gotta get them all. Oh
[18401.16s -> 18433.08s]  I want that it's worth it only um, what three more chapters?
[18435.70s -> 18461.06s]  All right, I need to stop this take away two minutes that just took me to do that
[18466.70s -> 18469.66s]  Okay
[18469.66s -> 18480.65s]  Okay, that's a b one of the reasons I didn't use an item back there is because it was gonna be s

[18540.30s -> 18573.86s]  Do I actually get to use this? Oh, that's devil may cry one. I think I want to make a few changes
[18574.26s -> 18578.58s]  This thing is amazing. But I just don't activate it
[18583.13s -> 18587.42s]  I think i'll go with sword master and then also
[18592.34s -> 18608.00s]  I'm curious about this
[18608.00s -> 18609.68s]  17 getting close
[18609.68s -> 18625.43s]  There's only what 17 18 19 20 only four more. All right, let's go
[18626.37s -> 18635.17s]  Uh, so what's the correct way in the door the high? Yeah, I was here already
[18637.30s -> 18673.14s]  No wrong. I can go this way, but wait only I had the double jump. Oh, this is a place to go
[18673.38s -> 18676.07s]  Trial of the warrior. Okay
[18697.20s -> 18745.41s]  All right, let's do it activate it again. All right
[18746.60s -> 18783.94s]  Oh, no, one of you think I have to activate him again. I do whoop that one's yep. Oh shit
[18786.87s -> 18801.56s]  Don't hurt me get away from that thing. I want to activate it
[18838.87s -> 18840.87s]  All right, turn this on again
[18841.27s -> 18946.64s]  Come here. Really?
[18946.64s -> 18948.64s]  Is he concentrating? I am
[18948.64s -> 18951.25s]  I feel like you have to in a game like this. Otherwise, you're just gonna die
[18957.03s -> 18965.67s]  All right, it's gonna show up here in a second
[18965.67s -> 18967.27s]  All right. Fuck you, man
[18967.27s -> 19016.16s]  All right, turn it back on move. All right. Now, let's go
[19016.80s -> 19062.55s]  Do I have to my god? What the hell dude? Why do I have to do this?
[19063.19s -> 19089.84s]  Why can't I just fight the guy get off of that?
[19111.17s -> 19133.24s]  Oh, i'm gonna die
[19133.24s -> 19135.24s]  How i've hit this guy?
[19135.24s -> 19136.82s]  two or three
[19136.82s -> 19138.23s]  hundred
[19138.23s -> 19156.79s]  Million times and he's still alive. Did you do the million stab?
[19157.51s -> 19162.80s]  I feel like the opportunity for those combos is like close to zero because i'll get in i'll be like here
[19162.80s -> 19181.62s]  Okay, here comes the step and i'll just get hit
[19182.18s -> 19183.57s]  pause
[19183.57s -> 19186.56s]  Then spam. Yeah, like right here. I get hit him. I'm done
[19249.65s -> 19284.02s]  Do both or none? I know it's okay. Where is that piece of shit enemy? Okay
[19288.13s -> 19322.85s]  Shut up. Oh my god
[19363.59s -> 19383.56s]  My god, I fucking hate this thing. This is so awful. This is awful
[19384.20s -> 19404.92s]  I'm dead. It's optional. Well, I I have to beat it. I'm right there
[19451.14s -> 19455.88s]  Stop using weak weapons. There's only five in the game. I'm using two of them
[19456.52s -> 19482.44s]  Come here. All right harry. All right, come on
[19483.16s -> 19507.54s]  All right, how many times are you gonna do that?
[19533.75s -> 19550.90s]  Yeah, I don't want to grab a hold of that thing
[19551.62s -> 19584.08s]  Get away from me. No
[19584.08s -> 19592.18s]  Get out
[19592.18s -> 19599.78s]  Die
[19599.78s -> 19605.64s]  How could you still be how could you still be alive? How is it? How could you still be alive? It's not even possible
[19624.02s -> 19626.50s]  What the fuck? Come on, dude
[19647.65s -> 19652.90s]  Die
[19659.56s -> 19662.44s]  Hit the wheels if I go to the wheels he goes
[19665.88s -> 19668.28s]  It's just as it fucking sucks
[19668.84s -> 19707.01s]  Okay
[19707.01s -> 19727.80s]  Um, i'm gonna save everything to the very end. I don't like that if you just touch those
[19728.52s -> 19743.12s]  They just do it. So can somebody are they invincible if they if these are both not active?
[19743.68s -> 19753.32s]  Okay, let's go you fucking asshole
[19797.68s -> 19800.64s]  Get away from me for one second, dude
[19804.55s -> 19806.55s]  Don't he's gonna do it again. Oh
[19806.87s -> 19811.41s]  Oh my god
[19824.71s -> 19826.71s]  Just you open it
[19840.96s -> 19842.96s]  Let me just turn it on
[19854.71s -> 19873.80s]  Dude, I keep getting trapped in front of him. I don't even have any heels. I don't have any heels. I have to do this
[19883.40s -> 19885.40s]  What the hell is this enemy?
[19885.78s -> 19887.46s]  And why is it like this?
[19887.46s -> 19894.05s]  You don't even have an opportunity to attack this motherfucker before he just like to start to start teleporting around again
[19894.45s -> 19909.86s]  I just didn't want to die
[19910.34s -> 19924.21s]  Just walk behind him
[19926.91s -> 19931.99s]  Overtuned overtuned overtuned overtuned overtuned
[19937.73s -> 19940.13s]  Yeah, I know he's invincible but there is
[19940.93s -> 19945.57s]  Not a single opportunity where I can go turn on two fucking pirate wheels
[19946.45s -> 19948.45s]  He's he just doesn't stop attacking
[20000.15s -> 20002.15s]  I'm gonna turn the other
[20002.15s -> 20055.08s]  Turn the other pirate wheel can't dodge correctly. He does this move way too often
[20057.06s -> 20077.04s]  Way way too often. He does this move 10 times too often and now the thing's back to zero again. This is awful
[20106.87s -> 20109.43s]  This sucks absolute asshole. It really does
[20117.56s -> 20119.88s]  I there's no opportunity to fight this guy
[20120.76s -> 20124.68s]  You're either smacking a wheel or he's teleporting around the whole map and just screaming at you
[20125.24s -> 20153.24s]  But here we go again just admit you can't do it. It's a skill issue. It's a game issue
[20153.64s -> 20177.64s]  So how much less damage do I actually do to people I feel like I should have killed that guy by now
[20184.60s -> 20188.92s]  I mean, that's an unbelievable reduction in how these guys i'm i'm hitting the same guy
[20189.64s -> 20238.15s]  I have an idea every single enemy in this game have to have teleport
[20238.39s -> 20271.16s]  But they have to put that in for almost every enemy in the game teleport. See you later. All right, he's back
[20271.64s -> 20300.95s]  Oh my why does he parry every move in the front and then he teleports fuck this guy
[20301.67s -> 20338.95s]  Dude stop appearing underneath me and then I this is so bad
[20343.09s -> 20362.52s]  This is bad
[20362.52s -> 20366.42s]  Where is he going?
[20366.42s -> 20368.42s]  Fuck this guy and fuck this game
[20368.74s -> 20392.23s]  I'm killing him right now
[20392.31s -> 20399.27s]  This is unbelievably awful on a scale of one to ten. This is at least an eight. This is at least an eight
[20418.61s -> 20422.61s]  Why do they have to teleport every single three seconds?
[20423.01s -> 20427.24s]  Do they have to teleport after every swing?
[20427.88s -> 20429.88s]  after every fucking swing
[20434.82s -> 20436.82s]  I can't but i'm so done
[20440.98s -> 20447.38s]  And I just replaced the thing that I just used so it was for no reason to come in here
[20447.62s -> 20504.39s]  Here comes another mald's
[20505.11s -> 20509.33s]  Oh, no
[20509.80s -> 20560.71s]  I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. Don't worry. Let's go. Not another one. Where are you?
[20584.58s -> 20635.46s]  Move ah, I feel like i'm in sludge half the time. Isn't that it? All right, you're gonna have a breakdown
[20635.54s -> 20654.93s]  No, i'm good. I'm good. So where the hell am I going? I I have to put the
[20655.96s -> 20666.85s]  Loud weapon on I feel like I was better with it. I sort of be careful or maybe the beowulf maybe
[20674.74s -> 20679.73s]  Uh, I have 20 000
[20685.24s -> 20690.21s]  Uh, I think it's air hike but what this
[20699.48s -> 20711.43s]  Yeah, so it's why why pause?
[20712.15s -> 20721.06s]  And then there it is. Okay, this dude bought air hike twice. I don't know what i'm doing
[20721.91s -> 20740.50s]  Yeah, but I don't want to use those swords anymore. Um
[20743.17s -> 20750.48s]  Do I want to keep this on where do I want to go back to trickster?
[20750.96s -> 20766.53s]  I feel like trickster is very helpful. I think that's the right call
[20777.11s -> 20778.55s]  There we go. Nice
[20778.55s -> 20816.04s]  Okay from here. There's nowhere else to go. I guess we're going back. I gotta go back up the cubes
[20816.20s -> 20841.43s]  This is not as bad as you guys think it's gonna be for me. I promise
[20848.64s -> 20851.76s]  I know a lot of you are expecting. Oh, wow. I can't wait. He's gonna fuck up everything
[20852.00s -> 20883.49s]  I'm gonna be all right right here so far. So good weird. Okay, I can go up here
[20883.49s -> 20906.82s]  Here
[20906.82s -> 20928.72s]  It really is the horror, okay now there was a trick to this it was four
[20938.45s -> 20941.35s]  Do I need to do this though? I feel like I don't need to do this
[20941.91s -> 20947.16s]  But I guess i'm oh my god
[20947.80s -> 20962.39s]  Wow
[20962.39s -> 21001.51s]  I got really lucky there. Did I do it? All right, we're getting close. Do I need to fight these? Maybe not I do
[21034.58s -> 21049.49s]  You're in for a cool boss fight, I'd love to hear it. Is it why pause why why or is it why pause why pause then that?
[21050.37s -> 21090.42s]  Okay, that's that it's why why why why why pause why why why why why good to know all right onto the big bridge
[21090.66s -> 21114.53s]  It's fine. All right, let's do it
[21155.08s -> 21157.08s]  Time to fight my shadow
[21159.76s -> 21161.20s]  This would be easy
[21161.20s -> 21167.88s]  Have you are you learning from all my moves because I got a d in every single level so this should not be hard at all
[21177.27s -> 21179.44s]  Oh, I can't hurt him. Uh
[21182.52s -> 21188.13s]  Oh, you don't like the light, okay, I get it go over to the light this lights this place up
[21209.60s -> 21210.88s]  Oh
[21210.88s -> 21247.33s]  Dude, you've ripped his skin off. I didn't do anything. No you come to me
[21260.18s -> 21307.96s]  I wasn't locked on I was holding bright trigger big damage. That's right. No
[21309.08s -> 21357.48s]  Come on really that I actually wasted it. That wasn't bad. Oh, no
[21362.80s -> 21375.01s]  Oh, yes, doppelganger special power used by the doppelganger enemy the style gives you more freedom to battle
[21375.73s -> 21385.36s]  Not a style. Okay
[21385.36s -> 21387.36s]  Give me a couple of new
[21387.36s -> 21394.50s]  Things to mess around with here right at the end of the game. Oh
[21409.97s -> 21424.32s]  We're just getting worse and worse 40 minutes
[21424.72s -> 21450.21s]  Well, it was 40 minutes because I spent at least 25 doing that stupid wheel encounter 18 invading hell
[21451.08s -> 21453.32s]  Break the seal and battle into the depths
[21475.72s -> 21505.00s]  Whoa, I have to fight the whole chess board. Do I have any pieces?
[21522.95s -> 21537.14s]  Lock on to this thing if they get to the end of the board. Do I lose?
[21537.38s -> 21559.64s]  I feel like that's what it's implying here
[21580.78s -> 21646.82s]  Everybody's come on. Yeah, that hurts so much. Get it. Does everything have to have a move that goes?
[21648.45s -> 21652.55s]  And then dashes across the screen
[21652.87s -> 21676.52s]  I've seen a theme here
[21676.52s -> 21688.21s]  Okay, I just have to vote. I'm gonna stay in the fists. It's way more damage
[21689.84s -> 21694.16s]  I gotta clear them out as fast as possible starting go one two three. What side happens first?
[21699.41s -> 21707.51s]  Can't combo just gets broken. I wish I had like some kind of
[21733.28s -> 21736.16s]  Don't lock on to random shit that's in the way, please
[21736.64s -> 21748.87s]  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I still got hit by it
[21795.01s -> 21820.93s]  All right, who's left you just come over here already
[21843.68s -> 21848.40s]  Dude, check this tutorial. No, this is fucking crap. This is crap
[21849.22s -> 21851.22s]  This is crap
[21864.00s -> 21865.68s]  That's what dad says
[21865.68s -> 21872.32s]  Do you give dad the controller for like gta or something?
[21873.35s -> 21879.75s]  I drive all the time. He's going 20 miles per hour down every single road. He's hitting every single car
[21880.31s -> 21883.59s]  He doesn't get it. It just goes this is not something. This is crap
[21886.24s -> 21913.62s]  This is crap. So
[21913.62s -> 21915.62s]  Holy shit, I did it
[21922.93s -> 21936.23s]  This is crap
[21936.23s -> 21952.88s]  Yeah, at least watch the rest on youtube. Okay
[21961.24s -> 21969.38s]  I'm curious about it
[21969.38s -> 21971.38s]  What is oh
[21971.54s -> 21973.62s]  Okay, you want me to do this now?
[21994.23s -> 22043.09s]  Probably not a great weapon for this. All right. This is what I wanted to do. I didn't how did I not hurt him at all?
[22043.41s -> 22071.51s]  How do I call on the other dante?
[22071.67s -> 22108.77s]  No, they're still coming in ice
[22109.25s -> 22139.44s]  Changing the targets makes me want to throw up. I'm gonna lose
[22161.54s -> 22162.50s]  Oops
[22162.50s -> 22175.96s]  Okay, uh, I see a couple things wrong already. These weapons are not for this fight
[22176.52s -> 22178.44s]  Putting we're putting on
[22178.44s -> 22186.96s]  these
[22186.96s -> 22188.80s]  and I want
[22188.88s -> 22197.44s]  Uh, I don't want this
[22197.44s -> 22199.44s]  I was burping. I wasn't crying
[22218.98s -> 22272.26s]  Way better. We're i'm hearing those explosions again, and it's kind of freaking me out. Whoa
[22287.86s -> 22303.03s]  Get it only got to kill like four more of those or way more than that
[22303.35s -> 22307.64s]  Do I have to kill every single boss in the game?
[22307.64s -> 22315.41s]  This is gonna stink. Isn't it? This is gonna stink. Who's this one?
[22319.03s -> 22320.95s]  Oh, no
[22320.95s -> 22378.32s]  Are you doing are you gonna beat the game tonight? I plan on it. I'm gonna try to come here
[22378.64s -> 22399.70s]  I gotta hit these guys in the back too. It's just it's it's just it's you know what I mean like
[22400.34s -> 22456.45s]  This is crap
[22456.45s -> 22460.45s]  One move andy it's the only move I can do but they just run so far away
[22460.53s -> 22470.08s]  They jump around dash around and I've I've hit him and they just back back up back up fight me
[22502.50s -> 22504.74s]  He's royal guard idiot
[22505.70s -> 22587.73s]  Time that person off for one second. I don't even start. Yes. All right, who's the worst boss that I don't want to fight right now?
[22588.45s -> 22600.92s]  I don't want to fight her right now. What's this one?
[22605.76s -> 22609.20s]  Dude, why did I pick the right one bite gem and you're done. What do you mean? I'm done
[22610.16s -> 22661.60s]  Am I actually done if I do this? I forget the combo for this way too slow. Why space? Why space? Why? Okay
[22714.02s -> 22781.73s]  I'm dead. God damn it. Unfortunately. I have a question if I
[22782.61s -> 22786.76s]  Use this orb I come back if I die here
[22787.32s -> 22793.36s]  And I reset do I have to fight the other two bosses in a row very important distinction
[22798.80s -> 22802.69s]  No, okay. Thank you so much. Appreciate the uh
[22811.56s -> 22816.61s]  Whoa, who's this one?
[22818.02s -> 22820.02s]  Oh this so I can do this one. This one's easy
[22850.69s -> 22868.32s]  That's taking way more hits now. They're all buffed up. Ah
[22877.46s -> 22922.92s]  Damn it really, you know, let me get a combo in I didn't get it. Shit
[22925.32s -> 22935.78s]  Really twice in a row. I didn't get it. It's annoying. I'll get it this time
[22936.26s -> 22967.17s]  What a waste what a waste I can cancel it
[22968.15s -> 22980.61s]  I didn't even know that till literally the last 10 minutes of the game. How come he keeps
[22981.17s -> 23018.21s]  Flipping back. When do I get the opportunity to actually attack him? All the lights gotta be up. Don't it?
[23018.21s -> 23021.57s]  Why I'm gonna attack him here. I shouldn't even do it get all the lights
[23042.40s -> 23051.27s]  Wait, I thought he turned that one off. He shot a beam. I thought he turned it off across the way. He threw it
[23052.74s -> 23056.26s]  He did his move. He turned he threw the projectile. I thought he turned it off
[23063.83s -> 23067.59s]  Yeah, he did that. I what does it just disappear if it if you actually turn all the lights on
[23068.31s -> 23125.09s]  Anyone I wanted the health don't throw. I won't come over here. Okay, we got him 15k. Nice anymore heals
[23125.41s -> 23136.13s]  I don't want to go on this with half health. I wonder if this anymore
[23141.84s -> 23146.24s]  Who's this? Oh, no, no, no. No, I thought this was a this was a giant one. I was like, oh cool
[23146.32s -> 23150.52s]  What's this big one? I think I should just die here
[23152.40s -> 23156.04s]  Just kill me because I just want the full health to fight the white door
[23166.85s -> 23171.76s]  If I just have to do the white one then why is there a point to do all them or no?
[23171.92s -> 23188.05s]  I'm going the wrong way was I going you'll get more red orbs
[23191.99s -> 23193.67s]  Let's just get this guy
[23193.67s -> 23277.73s]  Come on, man. I didn't want to even dodge towards him again, but you know how it is. I got so greedy
[23278.21s -> 23349.48s]  And I still am greedy. Fuck it. Just where is he? No go go go go
[23352.69s -> 23361.97s]  Thank god. All right. I did it
[23362.45s -> 23379.09s]  I was gonna say that's not a lot. So that's three. I've made a circle
[23384.92s -> 23390.52s]  Well, i'm really glad you guys told me that because I definitely would have tried to fight every single enemy in this game
[23390.92s -> 23423.91s]  Circle like it connected them in a you know, whatever i'm tired. Wait, did this guy know?
[23424.23s -> 23446.56s]  I feel like i'm gonna have a great time
[23446.72s -> 23485.52s]  All right. This is 19 out of 20. How do you eat blue cheese? It tastes like puke
[23485.76s -> 23515.97s]  How do you eat goat cheese? It tastes like dirt and say that too popple the great beast with bates bullet great beast
[23569.28s -> 23636.63s]  All right. Where's the great beast 26 000. Damn. Come here new zone
[23640.07s -> 23642.07s]  All right. It's just a gauntlet
[23648.92s -> 23652.20s]  All right, I can't hit these guys
[23652.20s -> 23655.68s]  what is
[23655.68s -> 23658.24s]  Substance projects image and image punishes substance
[23658.96s -> 23661.48s]  Do I have to hit them in the mirror?
[23661.48s -> 23697.56s]  Excuse me
[23697.56s -> 23718.32s]  Stop the vicious circle by bending time and space looks like something can be inserted here. Something can be inserted here
[23718.72s -> 23726.28s]  Back to some of the mirror opposite this one
[23726.84s -> 23766.93s]  Stop the vicious circle by bending time and space. Can I do it do more than one?
[23802.96s -> 23811.03s]  another one
[23811.03s -> 23815.24s]  27 000
[23815.24s -> 23844.52s]  I need a kiosk or whatever. They are can't hurt them. Okay. Oh, I can hurt them. All right
[23844.92s -> 23957.35s]  Here we go. Not bad. Did I do it? I got it. I failed it really fuck. Okay. Hold on dude. How many more combos?
[23957.91s -> 23986.64s]  He died already god. Damn it
[23989.67s -> 23998.02s]  Die, please
[23998.02s -> 24002.42s]  Is he dead? Did I do it? Oh, yes
[24002.90s -> 24021.70s]  I had a triple s going almost that whole time and still took him almost to the end. I wonder what the last boss is
[24022.18s -> 24049.51s]  I bet it's a cube
[24049.51s -> 24050.15s]  All right
[24050.15s -> 24073.27s]  It's time to upgrade one more time one more blue orb or get a gold orb
[24073.43s -> 24091.24s]  I think this is going to be a big deal. This is what I would do and then
[24092.69s -> 24106.13s]  Get stream level two you already had one. I can't resurrect twice
[24106.77s -> 24116.64s]  And you're only right. Yeah, you can. Yeah, i'm just giving myself some padding
[24127.62s -> 24138.82s]  I mean, this is the correct answer, right? I guess I could do another blue orb or that what do you think blue orb or
[24139.38s -> 24151.01s]  level two to that
[24151.33s -> 24175.16s]  Okay, gotta heal now. This is it right the road to despair. This is not right go in the mirror. Wait
[24175.88s -> 24201.20s]  Didn't I come out of that mirror I came out of that one didn't I oh shit, okay
[24201.52s -> 24226.77s]  So not here go back in the mirror. I just went in the mirror. Wait. What is again? Wait, how much?
[24244.56s -> 24246.80s]  statue I have
[24247.36s -> 24250.31s]  I need to put the thing in the staff
[24250.63s -> 24269.91s]  I I feel like that was a hundred years ago. Okay. All right. Now we go back in here
[24272.79s -> 24301.51s]  End of the line. All right. I already spent things cool. Okay final boss maybe
[24301.75s -> 24351.64s]  Yeah
[24351.64s -> 24355.73s]  Okay, big giant enemy
[24356.13s -> 24358.37s]  Imagining go attack big giant enemies legs
[24359.09s -> 24362.96s]  Big enemy will fall down hit enemy and face
[24384.40s -> 24430.16s]  All right, let's do it. Not bad damage. We're good. Jesus you have to attack these
[24430.88s -> 24435.17s]  What are they doing? They're about to fucking snipe me
[24467.24s -> 24500.13s]  All right. Let's see. I got some good healing out of that. Your loadout is ass. I'm busy
[24500.53s -> 24528.61s]  I'm a little busy right now, dude
[24530.16s -> 24542.29s]  What is the strategy here rocket?
[24542.85s -> 24545.19s]  me
[24545.19s -> 24547.19s]  Oh my god. Okay. Well
[24547.35s -> 24562.77s]  That was fun
[24562.77s -> 24566.28s]  I tried to hit select to open up the fucking menu
[24577.88s -> 24582.68s]  It's it's up on the d-pad and I have not been able to put that into my memory
[24583.40s -> 24587.32s]  It's the only game in history that's ever had up on the d-pad be go to the menu
[24587.48s -> 24592.42s]  There's no it hasn't been a single game in history that's done that and not in all of history
[24637.72s -> 24666.00s]  Okay. All right, bring out the bugs again. What are the hell they are?
[24693.84s -> 24710.60s]  Okay, um, why would I ever be locked on to that are you fucking serious? Why would it lock on?
[24711.16s -> 24729.72s]  To the and I don't even kill it because when you lock on you
[24730.28s -> 24732.28s]  D, uh, you know what? I was gonna whatever
[24732.76s -> 24798.00s]  Where you at?
[24813.30s -> 24816.74s]  Do we get to play together can I switch between them?
[24831.70s -> 24845.38s]  He needs to learn the heart of battle of brothers
[24845.94s -> 24848.39s]  Okay
[24848.39s -> 24852.47s]  Where's your fall is dante's lead but still spins off his own special style

[24961.22s -> 24964.82s]  Just six pixels where you can't hit one of those things and I found it

[24990.21s -> 25001.22s]  I love this one of these little shits just still here
[25013.00s -> 25015.00s]  Oh my god
[25016.47s -> 25018.47s]  Please just end it
[25020.82s -> 25022.82s]  Virgil do a fucking suplex
[25023.62s -> 25046.98s]  Hey, hey, hey, put me down. Hey, hey
[25049.12s -> 25052.56s]  What hold on i'm so what happened you shitting me?
[25054.34s -> 25056.34s]  I didn't know that's what was going on
[25057.19s -> 25058.79s]  No, first, okay
[25058.79s -> 25060.79s]  Turn around right now
[25061.03s -> 25066.64s]  Attack him
[25066.64s -> 25068.64s]  I didn't know that's what was happening
[25068.72s -> 25070.72s]  Oh my god, please
[25076.68s -> 25078.36s]  How did you fall for it again?
[25078.36s -> 25083.16s]  Dude, I had 10 I had one hp when he picked me up the first time and it killed me instantly
[25083.88s -> 25153.99s]  Oh, no
[25153.99s -> 25155.99s]  Classy for someone's dying words
[25167.68s -> 25189.44s]  Oh the sword there it is
[25190.46s -> 25193.40s]  dscdc
[25193.40s -> 25195.40s]  Well, whatever it is i'm
[25195.72s -> 25198.98s]  incredibly unprepared for it
[25198.98s -> 25201.38s]  Considering I just had to use two of those golden orbs
[25202.77s -> 25208.07s]  I hope this final encounter is the same encounter that capcom puts in all their games
[25208.96s -> 25252.61s]  Which is just aim the rocket launcher at the big scary thing and press a turn back to the jester
[25253.01s -> 25268.34s]  This is actually the hardest fight in the franchise coming up here
[25268.58s -> 25286.76s]  Oh, no. Oh, this is gonna be I got it. I'm not going in with a negative attitude. It's not happening
[25329.57s -> 25338.52s]  All right, i'm gonna try to do a world record here for this stream no no complaining for 10 minutes
[25339.52s -> 25341.68s]  That would be a world record in a hard game
[25342.64s -> 25355.67s]  No complaining for 10 minutes straight and you bet on that. Yeah, sure. I'll try as hard as I can
[25357.75s -> 25360.23s]  I will not complain will I complain?
[25361.19s -> 25366.15s]  And by the way me saying what the fuck is that? What is this move? Oh, this is bull. This is bullshit
[25367.03s -> 25372.88s]  No, we're talking about I have to sincerely be like and why does he teleport? That's not fair. Why does he have a dash?
[25374.92s -> 25382.53s]  All in or no, okay. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. I will not make a single complaint
[25383.09s -> 25389.49s]  I'm gonna be super happy the whole time and run a poll if you want for 10 minutes
[25390.44s -> 25393.00s]  In 10 minutes in one second, I have completed the challenge
[25401.12s -> 25416.26s]  You have to eat a blt on stream if you complain. Okay. Yeah, that sounds fun. Yeah 10 minutes. Okay
[25416.98s -> 25418.98s]  Oh, I only have 15 000
[25420.47s -> 25426.04s]  No, it's I don't have enough
[25426.04s -> 25429.48s]  I've wasted that other one. I didn't I didn't know that was it
[25430.40s -> 25434.28s]  I have to buy these
[25434.28s -> 25436.68s]  No, no, no, no, no, no that we haven't started yet
[25440.63s -> 25442.87s]  We haven't started yet
[25442.87s -> 25444.95s]  Well, this is free money if you just are curious
[25445.81s -> 25450.53s]  This is a free channel point increase to whatever you have because there's no way right like I just I forgot
[25451.72s -> 25453.72s]  No, no, no, no. No, is that it?
[25457.35s -> 25460.50s]  Is it in are we good?
[25460.50s -> 25463.62s]  That wasn't a complaint. That was me expressing my sadness
[25470.98s -> 25491.84s]  I know i'm gonna buy one of these
[25494.21s -> 25496.21s]  And I know i'm gonna buy one of these
[25504.92s -> 25507.08s]  People are going all in. Oh boy
[25509.65s -> 25514.68s]  yeah, the timer can start from when the
[25515.73s -> 25520.45s]  Inevitable cutscene here ends and the actual boss health bar is on the bottom of the screen
[25521.08s -> 25525.14s]  That is when you can start the timer when boss's health bar is at the bottom of the screen
[25533.70s -> 25537.30s]  If you lose again, if you lose this you have to eat salt and vinegar chips as well
[25539.33s -> 25550.44s]  That's fine. Yeah blt with those chips. Yeah, sounds like a good lunch and goat cheese
[25550.44s -> 25554.82s]  No, I will I refuse. I will turn the stream off. I just I will I will run from that
[25556.88s -> 25564.02s]  We're not going goat cheese yet. I haven't even been it's having been 10 minutes. All right, here we go
[25568.26s -> 25570.26s]  I am going to use the weapons. I have right now
[25571.78s -> 25576.92s]  I am going to keep the trickster. Let's go
[25579.52s -> 25599.33s]  When I play hard games like this, I feel like half of my sentences are complaints
[25601.36s -> 25613.99s]  This is gonna be rough
[25613.99s -> 25615.99s]  Yeah, wait till the gameplay starts. We're not going yet
[25635.86s -> 25642.80s]  Don't even talk 10 minutes is a long time. What is it right now? It's 10 41 specific
[25666.63s -> 25668.63s]  Okay, here we go
[25668.87s -> 25670.15s]  begins now
[25670.15s -> 25671.43s]  Timer starts now
[25671.43s -> 25721.51s]  It almost just happened. No, i'm not muted. I promise he has health back just asking a question
[25721.75s -> 25724.79s]  I asked I was asking if he has his health back. It was a question
[25726.61s -> 25731.97s]  I was asking if he heals. That's not no, it's not i'm fine. I was just like thinking wait
[25731.97s -> 25734.61s]  Does he have his health back? Is this a heal mechanic?
[25735.65s -> 25755.30s]  That's all that was
[25758.52s -> 25827.92s]  Oh, he's in demon mode my turn getting really hard to not it's so difficult right now
[25827.92s -> 25846.72s]  I'm trying as hard as I can to not say anything. What do you mean a complaint? What are you talking about?
[25846.72s -> 25850.64s]  No, I said I'm trying really hard to not it's got to be a complaint
[25851.60s -> 25855.36s]  I have just said this is very difficult to not do this. That's no it's not
[25855.92s -> 25858.55s]  It's very difficult
[25858.55s -> 25859.81s]  and
[25859.81s -> 25861.81s]  I've noticed an observation
[25867.59s -> 25871.03s]  I'm just simply observing a few things
[25871.67s -> 25877.09s]  I'm not this is not a complaint. It's just I really need to get better at timing that dodge
[25877.57s -> 25884.08s]  I'm gonna own that one better at timing that dodge is what would have been good there
[25884.24s -> 25887.52s]  That's nothing to do with anything to do with what happened. We're good
[25888.56s -> 25891.14s]  It's about timing the dodge. That's all that was
[25891.78s -> 25920.79s]  I still have six minutes. I feel like that's a million years, which is an observation. It's just it feels like a long time
[25924.85s -> 25926.93s]  No, it's not. That's not a complaint
[25929.36s -> 25931.36s]  That's an observation
[25934.26s -> 25939.27s]  No, it's not
[25939.27s -> 25941.27s]  No, it has to be a complaint
[25943.78s -> 25946.26s]  Let me start over it. Let me start over it. Let me start over
[25946.90s -> 25953.62s]  I didn't complain. I just said man. That's that's such a four six more minutes. That's a long time
[25954.50s -> 25986.95s]  It is a long time
[26008.08s -> 26009.04s]  Just
[26009.04s -> 26012.53s]  Kill me
[26012.53s -> 26018.44s]  He heals he does heal that is what happens. It's an observation
[26019.14s -> 26032.13s]  That's a heal. That's a big heal
[26033.30s -> 26036.50s]  And it's fine. I don't have a problem with it a heal at all
[26037.52s -> 26038.64s]  See
[26038.64s -> 26042.24s]  It's like it doesn't even it doesn't even faze me doesn't even faze me
[26065.73s -> 26092.10s]  Doesn't even faze me right now
[26096.58s -> 26098.50s]  Hey virgil that was
[26098.50s -> 26104.90s]  Just an observation. That was a pretty very long demon form. I'm up just observing that I don't care at all
[26104.98s -> 26107.06s]  By the way, I am i'm fine with that
[26108.45s -> 26114.69s]  Just an observation that was a pretty long demon mode. That was very interesting. I'm very interested by what I just saw
[26132.58s -> 26136.48s]  I'm just observing the game. Uh, it's fine though. I don't care
[26204.24s -> 26212.60s]  I gotta play very defensive
[26212.60s -> 26217.75s]  Everything is everything is just fine. Just another observation
[26219.08s -> 26220.76s]  I like his jacket
[26220.76s -> 26242.64s]  I like his jacket. It's a nice jacket. I need to get a good combo in here
[26282.02s -> 26310.68s]  Uh, i'm not even close to beating him. That's not a complaint. That's a fact time up time up
[26310.76s -> 26320.85s]  Is time up is time up do we count the devil trigger complaint?
[26321.57s -> 26331.76s]  Show it to me show it to me. I'll make the ultimate decision show it to me. Let me see. Give me a clip
[26332.32s -> 26355.67s]  I want to watch a clip
[26356.55s -> 26362.44s]  I think somebody just said chat. Fuck you. It was an observation
[26364.48s -> 26371.27s]  See, that's good. That's good. That's good. Okay
[26371.59s -> 26377.36s]  Okay
[26377.36s -> 26397.51s]  You tried to save it. No, did I anybody got a clip nightbot keeps deleting them gaining viewers
[26399.19s -> 26407.22s]  Nice you were complaining and then said it was an observation
[26411.19s -> 26423.76s]  I don't think anybody even has this. Okay, is this it? All right, let's see
[26434.15s -> 26438.52s]  All right, i'll put this on stream and we'll we'll go over it and we're gonna go over it
[26438.84s -> 26456.00s]  We're also gonna vote on it. I'll give you my two cents on it, but then we'll vote. Oh wait, that would be really biased
[26456.08s -> 26472.04s]  Yeah, never mind. We're not voting. I'll tell you should we have a mod council decide? All right, let's let's see
[26496.05s -> 26497.89s]  Hey virgil that was
[26497.89s -> 26503.33s]  Just an observation. That was a pretty very long demon form. I'm up just observing that
[26503.49s -> 26509.11s]  Yeah, no that I did. No the for real. That's a that is a literal complaint. That is actually a complaint
[26509.43s -> 26516.45s]  Yeah, i'm sorry. That is and do you want to know how you can tell i'm sorry everybody, but this is how you can tell
[26517.09s -> 26527.35s]  This part right here that part right there
[26528.63s -> 26535.38s]  Was me internally just talking shit about this game and then I finally just let it out
[26541.64s -> 26543.56s]  Hey virgil that was
[26543.56s -> 26548.92s]  Just an observation. That was a pretty very long demon form. I'm up just observing that
[26549.08s -> 26550.60s]  I don't care at all by the way
[26550.60s -> 26557.00s]  I I internally was was screaming about how long that was I was like that's fucking bullshit how long that demon form was
[26559.62s -> 26568.15s]  I think I think that counts, but you said you don't care. I'm fine with that
[26575.35s -> 26584.64s]  Okay, no, I think it counts you said hey virgil like hey paul
[26592.85s -> 26599.49s]  Let's do it again. How about this? How about this? Can I be can I be fucking quiet for five minutes?
[26601.28s -> 26602.80s]  Want to do it again
[26602.80s -> 26609.12s]  Can I be completely silent for five minutes while fighting and i'm not muting. I i'm gonna do this completely by the book
[26609.84s -> 26615.24s]  But i'm not i'm just gonna watch the youtube video somebody beating this guy
[26630.64s -> 26635.86s]  I'm gonna play super passively. I don't care about combos. I just care about winning
[26636.58s -> 26640.32s]  It doesn't really help me does it?
[26640.32s -> 26683.72s]  Okay, wait another complaint one. Okay, I can complain now though, right?
[26684.44s -> 26690.34s]  Oh you okay
[26690.34s -> 26699.62s]  He's got all of his health. Can somebody check real quick?
[26700.80s -> 26702.64s]  What is the playstation?
[26702.64s -> 26703.76s]  two
[26703.76s -> 26757.09s]  Trophy completion rate of this encounter. I feel like it's less than a hundred people. No, no, no, no
[26757.33s -> 26775.41s]  Okay, so when does it start? So we were we're oh, we're gonna come back. All right. What are we doing this time?
[26779.17s -> 26794.34s]  He is healing too
[26794.34s -> 26801.52s]  Yeah, that includes so no sound no noise at all. No laughing. No heavy breathing. No, no marge simpson sounds
[26801.60s -> 26821.17s]  No homer simpson sounds five minutes of complete silence and i'm not muting the microphone. I promise you he didn't even get him down at all
[26821.25s -> 26845.24s]  All right, so when i'm gonna start over here, okay use devil use dt until he does face cam
[26845.32s -> 26849.16s]  No, i'm not not not after like seven and a half hours eight hours streaming
[26852.58s -> 26857.89s]  uh, this guy is
[26857.89s -> 26861.09s]  I I never would even gotten this far in playstation 2
[26861.91s -> 26864.71s]  I would have gotten to the second or third mission of this game and been like
[26866.07s -> 26874.87s]  No, i'm done
[26874.87s -> 26877.43s]  No face cam no deal. I I don't have any clothes on
[26881.86s -> 26884.20s]  23 percent on ps3 and ps4
[26888.72s -> 26899.28s]  75 percent of us got to this part and went that was fun. Okay, are we ready?
[26906.20s -> 26909.28s]  I'm I have to be quiet
[26909.28s -> 26913.38s]  I'm not i'm how am I gonna mute the microphone? I have to touch it. All right, you ready?
[26915.03s -> 26922.26s]  Five minutes of complete and total silence the microphone. I'm gonna put it right here. You understand
[26922.98s -> 26927.35s]  Do you understand how close this is? You're gonna hear anything that comes out of my fucking mouth anything
[26933.01s -> 26935.01s]  I can breathe though. All right
[26936.53s -> 26943.56s]  Shit you're gonna hear me breathe that counts. Okay, so tell me does this count?
[26948.58s -> 26961.11s]  That's just me actually breathing. I think we'll be able to tell the difference. Okay, here we go
[26963.97s -> 27003.40s]  Start the timer now
[27142.48s -> 27146.58s]  So
[27172.68s -> 27178.12s]  I was trying so hard. I looked over at chat and somebody you fucker you asshole
[27179.16s -> 27181.00s]  somebody said
[27181.00s -> 27183.72s]  Bro, imagine stopping in the middle of a combo to shoot
[27184.92s -> 27186.92s]  fuck
[27194.61s -> 27199.97s]  Imagine stopping in the middle of a combo to shoot just like that person thinks i'm such a fucking dummy
[27200.05s -> 27201.25s]  You know what I mean?
[27201.25s -> 27203.68s]  Oh, that's so funny
[27203.76s -> 27205.76s]  Oh my god, i'm so sorry
[27211.97s -> 27213.97s]  You should have seen me pulsing
[27214.37s -> 27217.41s]  I was probably purple. I was trying so hard. It was like
[27219.17s -> 27226.55s]  And then it just came out I was fucking shit I had to have been shaking. Oh my god
[27235.08s -> 27236.84s]  This is so hard
[27236.84s -> 27243.28s]  I've been streaming for like eight hours too. I I might have to actually call it a night here
[27250.15s -> 27252.31s]  All right, i'm gonna i'm gonna give it one more try
[27260.12s -> 27263.00s]  Oh my god, that's so funny another bet
[27271.54s -> 27286.77s]  One more I was trying so hard to keep it in because I knew there was only like a minute left
[27293.68s -> 27300.32s]  Imagine stopping mid combo to shoot like oh i'm doing a good job. I got him. Let me attack him
[27303.22s -> 27305.22s]  This is so ridiculous
[27308.23s -> 27312.31s]  All right, i'm just gonna play let's go. It's it's time right now. No more predictions. No more betting
[27312.95s -> 27314.63s]  i'm doing it right now
[27314.63s -> 27338.47s]  dude
[27338.47s -> 27340.87s]  We're not even I can complain again. I can complain
[27344.40s -> 27350.72s]  There's nothing in video games that I hate more than enemies that run away or teleport away and you have to chase them
[27351.36s -> 27353.60s]  That's this whole entire video game
[27354.08s -> 27356.08s]  That's this entire video game
[27356.16s -> 27394.24s]  Trying to get the timing of the attack attack pause attack attack attack when you're when you're in a game scenario
[27394.32s -> 27427.12s]  That shit is so fucking hard to actually do how many controllers you think have been broken from this game?
[27428.34s -> 27432.08s]  Do you think it's more than 25 000? What do you think?
[27433.41s -> 27436.45s]  Do you think it's more than 30 000 controllers have been broken from this game?
[27479.36s -> 27487.22s]  I cannot beat this guy even millennia. I was like making progress. This guy just just destroys me every single time
[27487.86s -> 27517.52s]  I'm putting the bay wolf on yeah, fuck this. Give me the fuck out of there piece of shit
[27519.14s -> 27576.79s]  Let's try this
[27577.97s -> 27579.97s]  Oh
[27584.45s -> 27618.92s]  My god, dude, where is the opportunity to fucking attack this guy? What are the combos for this? I don't even know them
[27654.13s -> 27661.84s]  Pause why why why why why I don't like pausing. I like fucking going. I like person x I don't want to pause
[27661.84s -> 27697.17s]  Because
[27697.25s -> 27701.38s]  Dude, does he just parry every single fucking move he goes like
[27703.08s -> 27705.08s]  Why why how do I do that?
[27717.80s -> 27721.40s]  All right. I'm changing my stance. This is impossible. But with what i'm doing
[27724.44s -> 27745.25s]  This is impossible. I'm gonna try to parry him because how does the parry work?
[27762.44s -> 27764.76s]  Just press b when you're gonna get hit let me test it
[27770.21s -> 27787.01s]  Did it work am I doing it? I mean, it's a it's kind of a block
[27790.53s -> 27800.53s]  No, that's not gonna help me at all right now. I couldn't even do anything
[27811.86s -> 27825.08s]  I have to stick with trickster. I'll i'm gonna use the regular sword though. I did not
[27827.48s -> 27849.38s]  Uh, didn't I just change everything? Why is it back to these? All right, let's try again
[27867.41s -> 27895.24s]  Didn't want this equipped dude about that blt. I don't think i'm ever gonna beat this. I find this to be impossible
[27895.56s -> 27920.50s]  I don't think i'll ever do it. You beat millennia millennia was easier than this a hundred times easier
[27935.40s -> 27946.32s]  This has the heal from millennia and teleporting is worse also I you can summon a summons
[27967.16s -> 27969.16s]  This is fucking ridiculous
[27969.64s -> 27973.94s]  This is ridiculous
[27973.94s -> 27981.30s]  Stop backing off dude. He look what he does. Wow. I didn't back off. He did you should be yelling at his fucking chat
[27981.86s -> 27983.46s]  He's doing it. Not me
[27983.46s -> 27985.14s]  I i'm not look
[27985.14s -> 27988.92s]  I he's backing away
[28028.77s -> 28033.68s]  Oh my god, he just parries every single fucking move
[28035.09s -> 28039.17s]  There there is no exchange. He just walks and then teleports away and then does this
[28055.04s -> 28059.36s]  Look at how much slower my moves are i'm waving around a fucking toy. I'm like one
[28060.00s -> 28063.76s]  Two three four and he's already moved across the map by the time I do it
[28109.27s -> 28119.38s]  Get out of your fucking demon form, dude. I can't even hurt him. Yeah millennia didn't have a fucking form where she goes and no
[28120.18s -> 28127.38s]  Rot you can't hurt me at all. I've been invincible and I can heal off these i've been invincible for a full two minutes
[28149.30s -> 28150.50s]  Oh, wait
[28150.50s -> 28170.36s]  Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Oh, oh great. We both have the same idea
[28190.66s -> 28193.22s]  God just attacks bro. Come on, dude
[28193.70s -> 28198.66s]  Do you have any idea how un fucking bearable this encounter is you have you played it?
[28199.75s -> 28203.00s]  Have you played it? Did you play it if you didn't?
[28203.65s -> 28204.61s]  and
[28204.61s -> 28227.28s]  Silence if you did, you know what I just do. Oh, I can't even get him down to 50 before i'm just dead
[28229.64s -> 28232.20s]  I'm gonna do this three more times and then i'm turning the stream off
[28233.08s -> 28234.68s]  I'm getting out of here
[28234.68s -> 28237.65s]  I'm gonna free myself from this fucking madness
[28238.37s -> 28278.02s]  This is the first game I played when I was six years old. I am so sorry for six-year-old you
[28278.98s -> 28319.03s]  You probably had so many awful memories of this game. Look at my health
[28330.44s -> 28378.42s]  You have work. Nobody played this when they were six. They're full of shit. Don't listen to them. This may be fun
[28379.38s -> 28386.40s]  What the fuck was that where's my move that can do that dante get back to the fucking gym
[28387.12s -> 28389.12s]  Do a little lift a little more weights
[28389.52s -> 28395.40s]  He's almost back to full health again
[28395.40s -> 28397.67s]  He's he wait
[28397.67s -> 28399.67s]  He doesn't this is not millennia
[28400.24s -> 28406.10s]  He just heals when he's in demon form. What is this fucking dog shit?
[28411.86s -> 28414.82s]  He doesn't have to hit me
[28414.82s -> 28417.48s]  So do you yeah, i'm the video game protagonist
[28418.10s -> 28420.10s]  Nobody else gets those powers
[28420.34s -> 28433.14s]  Just I wish you just didn't counter every other swing like it just would be so much more
[28433.54s -> 28436.02s]  It would just be like you have to counter every move
[28437.06s -> 28439.30s]  Like dude, why can't I just attack him?
[28457.59s -> 28459.67s]  You have to damage burst him out of that
[28461.11s -> 28463.11s]  Good luck when he blocks
[28463.41s -> 28471.27s]  90 of every swing you do no matter what all right two more attempts and i'm fucking uninstalling the game
[28511.08s -> 28513.08s]  No stay out of that
[28537.49s -> 28539.57s]  Oh my god, dude, give me a fucking break
[28582.58s -> 28598.15s]  I don't have any heals. Didn't I buy one? I thought I had a large heal put it on easy
[28600.96s -> 28602.69s]  Wait
[28602.69s -> 28604.76s]  They're gone gone
[28604.76s -> 28613.73s]  If you use it, they're gone. They don't come back like when I restart that checkpoint. It's fucking five grand to buy one of those
[28620.44s -> 28622.44s]  Oh, that's awful
[28625.32s -> 28627.72s]  It's ten thousand now to buy a heal
[28629.17s -> 28631.17s]  Yeah, you have to restart the whole mission
[28631.49s -> 28633.17s]  Are you kidding me?
[28633.17s -> 28635.60s]  Oh that stinks
[28635.60s -> 28654.36s]  Okay, well
[28654.36s -> 28664.39s]  Restart the mission won't that put me through the first boss fight though. Wait optimize
[28666.34s -> 28668.96s]  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I see
[28669.04s -> 28671.04s]  Uh, so what the hell am I gonna do here?
[28678.24s -> 28682.64s]  All the gold orbs were used already. I didn't even know there was a final final final fight
[28682.64s -> 28685.68s]  I thought we were like working together and oh, yeah, we won together
[28686.32s -> 28693.14s]  Just go farm orbs. I might do that not tonight though
[28721.96s -> 28734.32s]  I wish I could not be stuck in that animation. It does so much damage. It's already over
[28734.56s -> 28781.20s]  It's a good place to get orbs. What's a good spot to do it 19 cancel out of the dive kick if you mission two
[28790.28s -> 28792.05s]  I just want to buy
[28792.05s -> 28794.37s]  Like another one of those gold orbs. I had two
[28795.01s -> 28827.99s]  I I just don't think it's possible without that without like three golden orbs and like eight heals
[28828.39s -> 28831.75s]  I'm going in there. I'm bringing a backpack full of shit into that fight when I go in there again
[28832.07s -> 28834.07s]  I'm gonna have 10 heals
[28834.07s -> 28839.17s]  And 30 revives I don't care if I die 15 times in a row
[28839.81s -> 28873.16s]  Never mind. I give up. Never mind. I just saw how many I collected it. That's gonna take like six hours
[28876.66s -> 28881.17s]  All right, that's it. I'm out of here. Uh, and i'm never playing this game ever again
[28881.41s -> 28884.63s]  I mean until i'm dead like this is not gonna happen ever again
[28884.87s -> 28892.53s]  Yeah, like they'll be they'll be like doing a funeral for me. They'll be like wait, but he never finished
[28892.53s -> 28898.20s]  He didn't beat virgil the priest is gonna go good. Fuck that whole game
[28899.97s -> 28905.49s]  Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to see our friend
[28905.97s -> 28976.96s]  We put to rest under the i'm getting weird with this one block every move andy
[29032.34s -> 29042.28s]  Damn it. You're just hailing you piece of shit
[29073.54s -> 29078.87s]  Even in demon form he blocks every move. How the fuck do you do this?
[29079.83s -> 29082.77s]  like honestly
[29082.77s -> 29084.77s]  This is fucking impossible
[29094.90s -> 29096.90s]  It took me two years
[29098.08s -> 29100.08s]  You should be jumping dude
[29102.61s -> 29108.61s]  Is this is this fucking dickhead on a top 10 list of most annoying boss fights in history? He has to be
[29118.44s -> 29136.16s]  Yeah, I get fucking exploited
[29136.32s -> 29208.32s]  What is this lock on fucking doing dude? Wait when the when you're locked on why can you swing in a different direction, dude?
[29209.68s -> 29211.68s]  It's so fucking annoying
[29212.24s -> 29236.68s]  it just like hurts just to attack him and
[29237.70s -> 29240.32s]  I don't know what the fuck's going on with this game
[29240.32s -> 29242.50s]  But like what the hell is going on here?
[29243.65s -> 29250.69s]  The game just literally turned like off and is down on my task bar four hours ago an explosion happened in my room
[29253.75s -> 29264.05s]  What is going on with this game?
[29264.05s -> 29279.35s]  I'm gonna lower the volume because i've no idea what's gonna happen here. Am I back? Oh my god
[29302.96s -> 29401.60s]  What's the point of a lock on if it just if you swing in a different direction shit, I can't no more teleporting
[29401.76s -> 29405.68s]  It's like the worst mechanic in every single video game
[29409.91s -> 29458.20s]  What the hell is this move?
[29458.20s -> 29492.02s]  Oh my god, what does that mean? Holy fucking shit, dude, dude
[29492.34s -> 29498.66s]  This weapon switching thing makes me want to fucking puke as well. What's he doing?
[29501.38s -> 29504.90s]  Where are my fucking heels? Oh my god this
[29505.52s -> 29508.34s]  2000 fucking 2 video game. I didn't
[29509.20s -> 29511.57s]  Restart the mission. Oh
[29511.91s -> 29513.91s]  My god, damn it, dude
[29538.52s -> 29544.84s]  I like just why like you've got to be fucking kidding me. That is infuriating
[29569.46s -> 29573.96s]  I literally had it. Yeah by doing the jump attack move
[29575.99s -> 29580.15s]  I'm so fucking pissed right now. I am so angry
[29584.06s -> 29588.38s]  Can I save it here so I don't have to do this shit over and over again if I want to restart the game?
[29597.05s -> 29604.01s]  Or do I have to restart every single time? Like what if I do this? Is that gonna do it?
[29604.17s -> 29654.14s]  Can I is that gonna work? No more teleport. God damn it
[29730.10s -> 29768.60s]  Oh great, I can't move. Where is he?
[29870.81s -> 29911.11s]  Okay, so I win. Game sucks. The sweat coming down my face right now. It's like all over my face
[29911.43s -> 29931.42s]  I look fucked up. If I turned on the webcam right now, I would scare you. Millennia is definitely harder
[29933.08s -> 29974.10s]  Yeah, that wasn't even that bad
[29974.10s -> 30002.89s]  Okay, I took a picture. I'll put it in the discord tomorrow. Yeah, no food quiz. Sorry
[30003.21s -> 30031.80s]  I had to beat Devil May Cry 3 and uh, I almost puked. Why is the volume so low now? I didn't turn it down
[30034.73s -> 30131.69s]  We should be fine for now. Oh wait, but they may though, right? We going again?
[30135.91s -> 30183.69s]  Oh, we are going again doing my victory lap. Oh, it's counting them. Oops. Well, that's fun
[30185.14s -> 30188.41s]  It was a a lot more intense than I thought it was gonna be
[30190.58s -> 30193.94s]  I didn't I knew Devil May Cry was a hard game, but I didn't know it was a really
[30195.02s -> 30198.82s]  Hard game. I would consider this to be really hard
[30208.17s -> 30219.40s]  DMC 3 is hard. DMC 4 and 5 are less so. Hmm. 3 is probably the hardest one
[30220.90s -> 30223.94s]  I remember 5 coming out and being interested in 5
[30239.22s -> 30247.67s]  You could probably beat DMC 2 with one hand. Really? Geez, you would really like 5
[30250.47s -> 30259.66s]  Well put it on the list
[30259.66s -> 30264.46s]  I would play at least the newer ones. I know the older ones can be a little weird, right?
[30265.18s -> 30268.62s]  The first one's like a completely different video game from what you guys said last night, right?
[30285.91s -> 30296.41s]  DMC 1 is very Resident Evil. 3 onward is fine
[30297.67s -> 30311.05s]  Hmm, you think 1 still holds up?
[30311.77s -> 30313.75s]  It probably does
[30313.75s -> 30316.71s]  But I would want to do the ones with a similar gameplay structure
[30317.43s -> 30324.94s]  Before I go back into the other ones
[30324.94s -> 30327.10s]  It absolutely does not. Oh, no
[30327.98s -> 30347.03s]  Can I get to 100? Well, if I wasn't RP walking around
[30347.67s -> 30360.95s]  Maybe I could have
[30360.95s -> 30365.54s]  Come on. Don't I get to 97? Ah, shit. Okay
[30388.50s -> 30392.39s]  Did you see how I beat that in two or three tries?
[30393.03s -> 30397.91s]  After I said I'm gonna uninstall the game. I said the same thing about Elden Ring, Millennium
[30398.31s -> 30418.22s]  That's how I know I have to beat it. That's the best way to do it
[30419.02s -> 30428.92s]  Okay
[30437.78s -> 30446.58s]  Okay
[30446.58s -> 30450.86s]  All right. I'll take an A for the first time
[30451.78s -> 30459.18s]  The entire playthrough at the last boss sounds good to me
[30466.28s -> 30483.05s]  Yeah, that that was about my report card. I'd say that's pretty close. I do hate being considered normal
[30483.61s -> 30485.45s]  So play it on hard
[30485.45s -> 30496.04s]  Okay, cool
[30496.04s -> 30498.79s]  All right. I'll see you guys later
[30498.95s -> 30511.37s]  Let's save it again just in case I want to open this up for any reason and I'll see you guys later
[30512.78s -> 30515.34s]  I'm glad I beat it. I'm glad I saw it to the end
[30517.19s -> 30522.73s]  Just had to threaten to uninstall it a few times to just to get myself seriously in that mode
[30523.05s -> 30530.52s]  I gotta pull that card out sometimes. Yeah, I'm glad I played it
[30530.76s -> 30534.39s]  I will probably play the other ones too at least maybe five
[30534.63s -> 30542.07s]  I would say five is probably would be next up before the next time you will see me live will be on the
[30542.87s -> 30551.11s]  Let's see, maybe saturday saturday, maybe sunday sunday the 21st
[30555.32s -> 30563.50s]  We'll see I might reverse the late saturday if that's possible plan on sunday, but there might be a reverse delay to
[30564.06s -> 30579.51s]  Start on saturday plan on sunday though. Thanks for watching. Thanks for putting up with my complaints
[30580.07s -> 30584.15s]  Mmm, I don't think this was not really a complaint stream not till like the last two hours
[30585.64s -> 30595.06s]  Hmm. No, I mean this was a kind of a complaint stream the last couple hours were I agree. They were observations. Yeah, that's fine
[30599.30s -> 30604.26s]  Also, I I have no idea what happened and I'll be lying if I
[30604.84s -> 30610.20s]  Was saying that didn't throw me off that like explosion shit from earlier that like really fucking threw me off big time
[30611.16s -> 30616.68s]  Uh, I don't know why that happened if it was a bug in the game. That's a really awful bug
[30617.26s -> 30621.42s]  I'm not gonna say that's what it was because I don't know. I have no idea why that happened
[30623.46s -> 30626.34s]  Who has any idea at this point?
[30626.34s -> 30629.78s]  I'm just sorry that that happened because I wish it didn't because that shit sucks
[30630.24s -> 30638.06s]  Especially when you're not prepared for it. So I don't think I mean
[30638.62s -> 30643.32s]  Look what I mean. We played I didn't change any settings. I didn't make any changes
[30644.42s -> 30651.40s]  After 15 hours in the game as the only time that happened. I don't I mean my obs is fine. My audio system's fine
[30654.74s -> 30657.46s]  I have no idea
[30657.46s -> 30664.44s]  I wonder if that really was an ultra rare bug that hung up the computer for a second and then
[30664.76s -> 30673.80s]  The audio just went crazy for those of you that thought that was really funny. I'm glad you did
[30675.02s -> 30679.93s]  But for those of you that didn't think that was funny. Yeah, i'm sorry. I I
[30680.49s -> 30687.66s]  Wish it was easier to control that kind of stuff from happening, but be careful. Take care of yourselves
[30687.66s -> 30697.77s]  I'll see you Sunday or Saturday. Take care of yourselves. Have a great night and thanks for watching as always
[30698.17s -> 30704.58s]  See you guys Saturday or Sunday. Take care. Call your mother get some sleep. See you soon
