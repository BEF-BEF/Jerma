[22.33s -> 23.67s]  Somebody said,
[23.67s -> 25.67s]  Hey, I want to talk to your manager.
[25.67s -> 27.67s]  You're three minutes late.
[27.67s -> 31.51s]  I am the manager.
[31.51s -> 41.28s]  What do you got to say?
[41.28s -> 43.28s]  Wait, the title is... Oh, the first...
[43.28s -> 46.48s]  I liked my title. It was
[46.48s -> 48.72s]  having fun farming.
[48.72s -> 50.72s]  Alright. That's all I need to say.
[50.72s -> 56.61s]  I got the tweet out already. I was prepared.
[56.61s -> 64.42s]  Hi, how are you?
[64.42s -> 67.24s]  How's it going?
[67.24s -> 70.44s]  Tonight's going to be a comfy night.
[70.44s -> 72.80s]  And you can tell that
[72.80s -> 74.80s]  because I've got a raspberry tea right here
[74.80s -> 77.68s]  and it's hot.
[77.68s -> 80.88s]  If I'm drinking hot tea,
[80.88s -> 82.88s]  it's guaranteed to be a comfortable night.
[82.88s -> 85.12s]  It's just the way it is.
[85.12s -> 91.01s]  Raspberry tea?
[91.01s -> 94.72s]  This bro's farming L's.
[94.72s -> 98.68s]  Yeah. It's alright though.
[98.68s -> 104.82s]  Is it hibiscus?
[104.82s -> 106.82s]  It's raspberry zinger.
[106.82s -> 109.32s]  It's the celestial brand.
[109.32s -> 111.62s]  It's good.
[111.62s -> 113.62s]  I think it's hibiscus, rose,
[113.62s -> 117.27s]  petals,
[117.27s -> 122.77s]  some other stuff.
[122.77s -> 124.77s]  It's good. It doesn't need anything.
[124.77s -> 126.77s]  Don't put sugar in it. Don't put anything in it.
[126.77s -> 128.77s]  It's just good. It just tastes good.
[128.77s -> 135.67s]  Raspberry zinger.
[135.67s -> 138.48s]  House Flipper came out
[138.48s -> 142.07s]  with an update, as you know.
[142.07s -> 144.07s]  Anytime House Flipper gets
[144.07s -> 146.07s]  a major, major update.
[146.07s -> 148.37s]  I am there day one
[148.37s -> 150.80s]  playing it. Hour number one.
[150.80s -> 153.68s]  This DLC released
[153.68s -> 155.68s]  two or three weeks ago.
[155.68s -> 158.95s]  So I missed it by a little bit.
[158.95s -> 163.04s]  But it's alright. We're good.
[163.04s -> 167.33s]  Are you going to make a Family Guy house again?
[172.20s -> 181.20s]  Well, build your own farm.
[181.20s -> 184.34s]  Fake fan.
[187.41s -> 189.41s]  Every time I restart
[189.41s -> 191.41s]  House Flipper,
[191.41s -> 193.78s]  I have to go through and get all
[193.78s -> 195.78s]  the tools and get money again.
[195.78s -> 197.78s]  Because I just delete everything.
[197.78s -> 199.78s]  I don't even sync it with the Steam Cloud.
[199.78s -> 202.60s]  I always say, make sure I do that.
[202.60s -> 204.60s]  And then something goes wrong and I just have to redo everything.
[204.60s -> 208.12s]  Yeah, the farming DLC
[208.12s -> 210.12s]  came out. Also, not just farming.
[210.12s -> 212.12s]  Apparently, you can
[212.12s -> 214.12s]  build your own house
[214.12s -> 218.47s]  from scratch now.
[218.47s -> 220.47s]  Before, that was a big,
[220.47s -> 222.47s]  one of the only cons
[222.47s -> 224.47s]  of House Flipper
[224.47s -> 227.09s]  was I thought that, oh,
[227.09s -> 229.09s]  I can't make a house
[229.09s -> 231.09s]  and put stuff in it.
[231.09s -> 233.91s]  Now apparently you can.
[233.91s -> 235.91s]  I know, it's called House Flipper.
[235.91s -> 237.91s]  That's not flipping houses. That's not flipping a house.
[237.91s -> 241.11s]  But still, I like,
[241.11s -> 243.11s]  I guess there's some more freedom now.
[243.11s -> 245.11s]  I don't know exactly how much, we'll find out.
[245.11s -> 251.12s]  It's just a fun time.
[251.12s -> 253.12s]  Yeah, that's the goal.
[253.12s -> 255.94s]  You guys ready?
[255.94s -> 258.69s]  You guys ready to hang out?
[258.69s -> 260.69s]  In this gigantic collective chat window?
[260.69s -> 263.96s]  While a 37-year-old
[263.96s -> 265.96s]  moron tries to
[265.96s -> 267.96s]  fucking build a house?
[267.96s -> 269.96s]  Alright, let's go!
[269.96s -> 273.41s]  I gotta give myself a little bit of credit.
[273.41s -> 275.41s]  I have like 120 IQ.
[275.41s -> 277.41s]  My performance IQ is like zero.
[277.41s -> 279.41s]  So, I'm not stupid.
[279.41s -> 288.87s]  Anyways, he's a genius.
[288.87s -> 290.87s]  I mean,
[290.87s -> 292.87s]  I mean, you said that. I didn't.
[292.87s -> 294.87s]  You said that.
[294.87s -> 298.39s]  But, blinking?
[298.39s -> 300.39s]  I guess so.
[300.39s -> 310.63s]  Thank you.
[310.63s -> 314.60s]  Alright, let's go. Yeah, you're gonna see.
[314.60s -> 316.84s]  I know, I start every single
[316.84s -> 319.33s]  time. I just want to check the audio.
[319.33s -> 321.33s]  This is not the color that I would want.
[321.33s -> 324.32s]  I just was testing
[324.32s -> 332.56s]  painting and everything again.
[332.56s -> 334.56s]  The DLC came out three days ago.
[334.56s -> 337.12s]  Alright, so we're good. I got time.
[337.12s -> 342.80s]  Why did you make the back rooms?
[342.80s -> 345.62s]  I just picked the first paint that I saw.
[345.62s -> 347.62s]  Alright, we're doing farming.
[347.62s -> 353.62s]  This is it right here. We did this one.
[353.62s -> 355.99s]  We did this one. I don't remember doing this
[355.99s -> 358.61s]  one, but I think we did. I don't know how eventful
[358.61s -> 361.60s]  this one was. Well, let's go.
[361.60s -> 367.92s]  Farm Flipper. It's a new map. Seems kinda
[367.92s -> 372.53s]  big. Alright, that's the one that's available.
[372.53s -> 376.56s]  Let's do that one. Where is Molly?
[376.56s -> 379.32s]  If you're looking for the perfect couple,
[379.32s -> 381.32s]  visit our Joe and Lily
[382.75s -> 384.75s]  Inseparable since childhood, happily married and
[384.75s -> 386.75s]  good ranchers too. And yes,
[386.75s -> 388.75s]  Sury, they're doing so
[388.75s -> 391.95s]  good, yet the locals don't know what this
[391.95s -> 393.95s]  morning Joe and Lily found.
[393.95s -> 395.95s]  Their barn damaged
[395.95s -> 397.95s]  and their favorite cow Molly was gone.
[397.95s -> 400.38s]  The couple might be able to handle one of these
[400.38s -> 402.38s]  issues, but two at once
[402.38s -> 405.90s]  is too much. Let's go. What do we have to go
[405.90s -> 410.44s]  find the cow? This is huge
[410.44s -> 423.42s]  drama. So what do I need to do?
[423.42s -> 429.31s]  Alright, let's go. There we are.
[429.31s -> 439.74s]  I'll take care of that.
[439.74s -> 441.98s]  That's easy.
[445.48s -> 447.48s]  The roof is gone.
[451.98s -> 453.98s]  Plane?
[459.29s -> 461.85s]  I got it. Don't worry. Where is
[461.85s -> 464.41s]  Molly?
[464.41s -> 468.25s]  This is just a Nancy Drew.
[468.25s -> 471.00s]  The Nancy Drew plot. Alright.
[471.00s -> 475.87s]  They got two. Wait.
[475.87s -> 491.10s]  There's a lot of stuff here. Could always just go on the
[491.10s -> 493.10s]  front door. Wait, I can't go in here.
[493.10s -> 501.23s]  Why am I not allowed in the house?
[501.23s -> 503.23s]  Oh, should I remove the drain pipe?
[503.23s -> 506.49s]  What are you doing over there
[506.49s -> 508.99s]  with the drain pipe?
[508.99s -> 511.55s]  I don't know. Just figured I would move
[511.55s -> 514.24s]  it. It's kind of an eyesore.
[514.24s -> 518.40s]  Oh look, I found a cow.
[518.40s -> 521.21s]  The game volume is a little low. I'll turn it
[521.21s -> 526.65s]  up. Keep it as a souvenir.
[526.65s -> 530.17s]  Alright, let me
[530.17s -> 536.43s]  go. Hold on.
[536.43s -> 543.34s]  Where is it? I don't think the music has to be that loud.
[543.34s -> 550.70s]  How's this? Better?
[550.70s -> 553.58s]  The problem with House Flipper is some
[553.58s -> 555.58s]  sounds just explode.
[555.58s -> 561.34s]  Just be careful. We have to test
[561.34s -> 564.73s]  something. Some of this stuff is
[564.73s -> 566.73s]  so loud. So I'd just
[566.73s -> 568.73s]  be aware that it's the mixing
[568.73s -> 570.73s]  on this game was one of those things that was always kind of
[570.73s -> 572.97s]  off. I'll take out the sledgehammer
[572.97s -> 575.34s]  and it'll just be
[575.34s -> 577.34s]  I'll hit a wall and an explosion
[577.34s -> 580.16s]  happens. Oh, also too.
[580.16s -> 582.16s]  The limited
[582.16s -> 584.16s]  items in the Grotto Beast store are
[584.16s -> 586.16s]  leaving tonight.
[586.16s -> 591.28s]  Just to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[591.28s -> 593.77s]  Tonight at 12
[593.77s -> 595.77s]  at 11.59 PM Pacific
[595.77s -> 598.14s]  tonight, the posters
[598.14s -> 600.96s]  the
[600.96s -> 602.96s]  yeah, all three posters are
[602.96s -> 604.96s]  leaving the store.
[604.96s -> 606.96s]  The glow in the dark ghost shirt
[606.96s -> 609.58s]  and hoodie.
[609.58s -> 612.46s]  The glow in the dark one. The
[612.46s -> 614.64s]  original 40 shirt also
[614.64s -> 618.09s]  is going to be gone.
[618.09s -> 620.09s]  Is that what he just said?
[620.09s -> 623.92s]  I thought he said
[623.92s -> 628.14s]  there's a store. Yeah.
[628.14s -> 630.14s]  Yes, there is.
[630.14s -> 639.93s]  But anyways, yes, Grotto
[639.93s -> 648.06s]  Beasts dot net. I feel so
[648.06s -> 650.43s]  bad. Like, wait, what do
[650.43s -> 652.43s]  you mean store? It's like, oh, shit, you don't know.
[652.43s -> 654.73s]  Well, it'll be there.
[654.73s -> 658.83s]  Yeah, you can keep that there for a little bit.
[658.83s -> 667.64s]  Okay, so let me let's clean
[667.64s -> 671.48s]  the fly noise. It was kind
[671.48s -> 674.62s]  of weird. This is one of my favorite parts
[674.62s -> 676.62s]  of the game. This is going to determine how loud it is, by the way.
[676.62s -> 681.10s]  That's not bad. Usually this
[681.10s -> 690.06s]  is pretty loud. It is loud.
[690.06s -> 693.12s]  Oh, well, it didn't look that loud.
[693.12s -> 697.08s]  All right, we're going to clean all this up.
[697.08s -> 699.26s]  But that's the task.
[699.26s -> 711.55s]  It doesn't need to look filled with water.
[711.55s -> 715.58s]  Where did I get that from?
[715.58s -> 719.04s]  Wait, you can have like farm
[719.04s -> 727.42s]  animals and stuff? What's your favorite?
[727.42s -> 732.92s]  Vinny just used your likeness
[732.92s -> 734.92s]  on the screen. That's all right.
[734.92s -> 740.24s]  Vinny has expressed written permission.
[740.24s -> 748.09s]  Don't worry.
[748.09s -> 750.09s]  Yeah, Vinny has expressed
[750.09s -> 752.09s]  written permission to use my likeness.
[752.09s -> 766.04s]  Play the Home Depot
[766.04s -> 772.00s]  song. No.
[772.00s -> 775.84s]  Some of this still looks...
[775.84s -> 779.68s]  Is that shit?
[779.68s -> 781.68s]  Why would I use this? Like use as in...
[781.68s -> 783.68s]  What do you mean use? Oh,
[783.68s -> 785.68s]  I... All right. What?
[785.68s -> 788.56s]  Am I eating it?
[788.56s -> 791.63s]  Where is it going?
[791.63s -> 794.06s]  I probably shouldn't do that.
[794.06s -> 806.54s]  All right. Place a fence and gate. Remove
[806.54s -> 810.00s]  trash. Milk container.
[810.00s -> 813.84s]  Okay. Still dirt everywhere.
[813.84s -> 818.70s]  How is this still dirt?
[818.70s -> 823.05s]  Are all the windows down here clean? All right.
[823.05s -> 825.05s]  I think it's clean now.
[825.05s -> 834.97s]  Wait, window. Looks pretty good.
[834.97s -> 845.77s]  All right. I need a fence
[845.77s -> 851.60s]  and gate. So this
[851.60s -> 853.60s]  is in this room. So clean the dirt. Clean
[853.60s -> 855.60s]  the window is the way. There's one more window.
[855.60s -> 857.60s]  Oh, there's still tons of shit over there.
[857.60s -> 871.15s]  All right. That's three.
[871.15s -> 874.99s]  Oh, it's dirty up here. What's
[874.99s -> 876.99s]  the best way to find Mithril in Terraria?
[879.87s -> 881.87s]  Just take what you just wrote
[881.87s -> 886.80s]  and paste it
[886.80s -> 888.80s]  into a
[888.80s -> 890.80s]  search engine.
[890.80s -> 893.42s]  Wait, what?
[893.42s -> 897.64s]  How's the performing DLC?
[897.64s -> 901.74s]  What are you doing? What?
[901.74s -> 904.43s]  Germa, you haven't tweeted about GrottoBeast
[904.43s -> 906.99s]  once. I've retweeted the GrottoBeast
[906.99s -> 915.44s]  account, though. That counts, isn't it?
[915.44s -> 922.80s]  That you're a fake fan.
[922.80s -> 930.54s]  This dude's farming L's.
[930.54s -> 932.54s]  Can I put this up? How do I make this...
[932.54s -> 934.54s]  Oh, rotate. There we go. Shift
[934.54s -> 938.64s]  and what? I don't think I can move this.
[938.64s -> 961.02s]  Oh, right here. I thought
[961.02s -> 963.96s]  my game crashed. Yeah. I mean, the thing
[963.96s -> 965.96s]  is, I don't really use
[965.96s -> 970.38s]  any social media, like, ever.
[970.38s -> 972.38s]  Besides here and sometimes in
[972.38s -> 975.07s]  the Discord, I just
[975.07s -> 977.07s]  log off, dude. I just log
[977.07s -> 979.88s]  off. I just log
[979.88s -> 982.76s]  the fuck off. All right. That's good.
[982.76s -> 985.58s]  Wait. This is
[985.58s -> 997.93s]  still dirty. All right. Milk container.
[997.93s -> 1000.68s]  All right. This is an enclosure.
[1000.68s -> 1003.31s]  How does this work?
[1003.31s -> 1018.52s]  Like this? There's a gate.
[1018.52s -> 1029.32s]  All right. Cool. Zero
[1029.32s -> 1036.11s]  percent. You just put a baby
[1036.11s -> 1042.25s]  gate there. Wait a minute. Hold on.
[1042.25s -> 1048.52s]  It wants me to put second floor
[1048.52s -> 1051.08s]  and then in this room here.
[1051.08s -> 1053.84s]  All right. Well, it wants me to replace the tiles
[1053.84s -> 1056.46s]  here. I can handle that.
[1056.46s -> 1066.51s]  Oh, he's farming L's.
[1066.51s -> 1070.73s]  Weren't we going to start banning people that said that?
[1070.73s -> 1078.52s]  I always had the impression that we were going to start
[1078.52s -> 1080.52s]  banning people.
[1080.52s -> 1088.08s]  That's what it says in the title. Okay. Almost done.
[1088.08s -> 1097.66s]  Just the first person? Oh, well,
[1097.66s -> 1100.35s]  we can make this kind of funny, though.
[1100.35s -> 1102.35s]  So let's wait for someone
[1102.35s -> 1104.35s]  to say it. And I'm talking like
[1104.35s -> 1106.35s]  half hour from now when everyone isn't doing it
[1106.35s -> 1110.38s]  anymore.
[1110.38s -> 1113.90s]  Just like ban somebody and just talk about, hey,
[1113.90s -> 1115.90s]  I've been live for like 13,
[1115.90s -> 1118.14s]  14 hours. And you
[1118.14s -> 1120.14s]  just ruined the streak. Nobody
[1120.14s -> 1122.14s]  said it. And we were talking about how nobody said it.
[1122.14s -> 1128.60s]  Like, wait, what? No, wait, nobody.
[1128.60s -> 1130.60s]  Not everybody said that?
[1130.60s -> 1132.84s]  No, I've been streaming for like 14 hours.
[1132.84s -> 1135.98s]  Sorry, but you get
[1135.98s -> 1139.12s]  banned. Place a fence and a
[1139.12s -> 1143.72s]  gate. How did I not do
[1143.72s -> 1173.92s]  that? Didn't I do it?
[1173.92s -> 1175.92s]  You have to build on the...
[1175.92s -> 1179.05s]  Dude, I thought this was
[1179.05s -> 1181.05s]  already here. I thought this was
[1181.05s -> 1183.05s]  way too filled in. All right?
[1183.05s -> 1185.05s]  I'm sorry. This is
[1185.05s -> 1187.05s]  filled in. It needs to be
[1187.05s -> 1189.05s]  way more transparent than that.
[1189.05s -> 1191.05s]  This is a white fence.
[1191.05s -> 1193.05s]  I thought this was a white fence, guys.
[1193.05s -> 1196.38s]  I did...
[1196.38s -> 1199.71s]  All right. Whatever. I was like, this shit's
[1199.71s -> 1208.41s]  almost done. All right. Now he
[1208.41s -> 1223.20s]  is farming elves. Okay.
[1223.20s -> 1225.20s]  Someone needs to fill this dude's noggin.
[1225.20s -> 1234.16s]  That's so stupid.
[1234.16s -> 1243.56s]  I wanted to make a big gate.
[1243.56s -> 1258.65s]  All right, cool. That's done.
[1258.65s -> 1261.77s]  There's still dirt somewhere. That's
[1261.77s -> 1264.40s]  done. Okay, here we go.
[1264.40s -> 1270.54s]  Garage door. I want
[1270.54s -> 1272.54s]  to put it here so bad. I want to put
[1272.54s -> 1275.80s]  it right there. It's the poop,
[1275.80s -> 1304.40s]  dude. What the heck?
[1304.40s -> 1306.40s]  Dude, this... All right.
[1306.40s -> 1308.40s]  Isn't this supposed to be here?
[1308.40s -> 1310.57s]  No, that's supposed to be there.
[1310.57s -> 1316.89s]  Okay. I need six fluorescent
[1316.89s -> 1323.42s]  lights. Guys, I'm not trying to make
[1323.42s -> 1325.42s]  this that wonderful looking.
[1325.42s -> 1327.42s]  I'm just trying to do the mission so we can unlock
[1327.42s -> 1364.67s]  the farming stuff. Crumb of a retweet
[1364.67s -> 1367.16s]  would be cool. It's only sponsors.
[1367.16s -> 1371.58s]  I just don't
[1371.58s -> 1373.58s]  use Twitter.
[1373.58s -> 1377.72s]  Like, for anything.
[1377.72s -> 1379.72s]  When I open up Twitter to... I didn't even take
[1379.72s -> 1389.00s]  a sip out of my tea yet. No, I'll tweet
[1389.00s -> 1391.00s]  out a Grotto Beast thing. You know, one of the things, once
[1391.00s -> 1393.18s]  the commercial was out, that was sort of
[1393.18s -> 1395.48s]  like the, all right, let's go.
[1395.48s -> 1398.36s]  There will be a Grotto Beast
[1398.36s -> 1406.41s]  tweet tonight. There will be.
[1406.41s -> 1422.97s]  Maybe back here? How many do we need? One or two?
[1422.97s -> 1427.00s]  Two? Ooh, cool.
[1427.00s -> 1433.26s]  Walk through that gate?
[1433.26s -> 1440.17s]  I'm fine. I got it.
[1442.17s -> 1444.17s]  This is the kind of gate that hurts your hips
[1444.17s -> 1446.41s]  when you walk through it. This thing
[1446.41s -> 1448.41s]  scrapes bone when you walk
[1448.41s -> 1451.16s]  through this. You get wedged in
[1451.16s -> 1453.16s]  and... Ow! Okay.
[1453.16s -> 1462.70s]  My hips hurt. All right.
[1462.70s -> 1467.24s]  Some water?
[1467.24s -> 1476.97s]  Probably in here, right? How is a cow going to fit
[1476.97s -> 1478.97s]  through? We'll see. I'll fix it if I need to.
[1478.97s -> 1489.47s]  If I need to.
[1489.47s -> 1491.47s]  Somebody also...
[1491.47s -> 1494.46s]  In offline,
[1494.46s -> 1496.46s]  like free stream chat, offline chat
[1496.46s -> 1499.21s]  here, there'll be like, oh,
[1499.21s -> 1501.21s]  exclamation point, tweet.
[1501.21s -> 1503.95s]  And since, since
[1503.95s -> 1505.95s]  like the end of February, whatever
[1505.95s -> 1507.95s]  it was, it's been that Wild Hearts tweet.
[1507.95s -> 1510.76s]  It's been like two
[1510.76s -> 1512.76s]  straight months of Wild Hearts ad.
[1512.76s -> 1515.52s]  It's just been two months of an advertisement.
[1515.52s -> 1517.52s]  It's been there every single day.
[1517.52s -> 1519.52s]  Every single day
[1519.52s -> 1521.52s]  it's been there for like two or three
[1521.52s -> 1532.01s]  straight months. They're getting their
[1532.01s -> 1540.78s]  money's worth? Yeah.
[1540.78s -> 1543.34s]  That's so stupid. Fucking Twitter.
[1543.34s -> 1550.32s]  Every time I open up the Twitter app, I like
[1550.32s -> 1552.32s]  just blow the
[1552.32s -> 1562.36s]  dust off. I need milk containers.
[1562.36s -> 1569.02s]  Oh, sell
[1569.02s -> 1571.02s]  the milk container.
[1571.02s -> 1575.63s]  Where are they? Oh, is this a milk container?
[1575.63s -> 1582.84s]  No? What is
[1582.84s -> 1593.08s]  a milk container? Oh, okay. That's
[1593.08s -> 1596.86s]  what I wanted to get rid of. So there's a
[1596.86s -> 1598.86s]  milk container somewhere in here?
[1598.86s -> 1602.30s]  It's not these, is it?
[1602.30s -> 1604.54s]  No, I like placed these.
[1604.54s -> 1606.54s]  Where's these? What is two milk containers?
[1606.54s -> 1608.84s]  Oh, it's these.
[1608.84s -> 1610.84s]  I thought I was looking. Okay. I was like, what the hell
[1610.84s -> 1614.17s]  does it want me to look for? Next to the door.
[1614.17s -> 1617.56s]  Oh,
[1617.56s -> 1619.56s]  boy. We just got a raid
[1619.56s -> 1621.56s]  from Squeaks.
[1621.56s -> 1625.26s]  What's up, Squeaks? And what's up?
[1625.26s -> 1627.26s]  What do you call your
[1627.26s -> 1630.08s]  audience? The Squeak
[1630.08s -> 1633.66s]  Maniacs.
[1633.66s -> 1636.16s]  Thanks for the raid. We just started
[1636.16s -> 1640.70s]  playing some house flipper. Those of you that are
[1640.70s -> 1642.70s]  in this community that have not
[1642.70s -> 1646.28s]  followed Squeaks, stupid
[1646.28s -> 1648.72s]  behavior. No, Squeaks is
[1648.72s -> 1656.01s]  awesome. What do I have to do out here?
[1656.01s -> 1661.58s]  Oh, oh my
[1661.58s -> 1663.58s]  look, there's chickens.
[1663.58s -> 1669.88s]  What? What?
[1669.88s -> 1674.88s]  Follow me.
[1674.88s -> 1676.88s]  What? Hold on.
[1676.88s -> 1678.88s]  Can I have like just a bunch of chickens follow me
[1678.88s -> 1680.88s]  around and help me? How many can I have
[1680.88s -> 1695.34s]  at one time? Cool.
[1695.34s -> 1703.15s]  Did you see the coffee bit Squeaks
[1703.15s -> 1705.15s]  did on stream a few days? Yes, I did.
[1705.15s -> 1708.09s]  It's classic. Pour
[1708.09s -> 1710.09s]  something out as if you're pouring it
[1710.09s -> 1712.09s]  onto your desk, but it goes into another container.
[1712.09s -> 1714.09s]  And then you pour that container out.
[1714.09s -> 1716.09s]  Oh, unbelievably classic.
[1716.09s -> 1724.03s]  You left it open? Oh, shit, I did.
[1724.03s -> 1730.17s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Everybody follow
[1730.17s -> 1734.84s]  No, no, I'll lose them. I'm not
[1734.84s -> 1736.84s]  ready for this, but I am ready for like in a couple hours
[1736.84s -> 1738.84s]  to have like 300. Like, I'm just
[1738.84s -> 1740.84s]  gonna have like a chicken army walk around with me.
[1740.84s -> 1752.48s]  I'm back in here. Okay.
[1752.48s -> 1755.29s]  Stop following me.
[1755.29s -> 1757.29s]  Can I give a treat? What is this?
[1757.29s -> 1760.56s]  Really? What could I do?
[1760.56s -> 1762.56s]  Minus one sunflower. Is it bad?
[1762.56s -> 1767.93s]  Grass is kind of tall in here.
[1767.93s -> 1784.04s]  You guys hungry? Okay, I gotta
[1784.04s -> 1786.04s]  make sure no one's following me. I don't want them to be stuck.
[1786.04s -> 1789.18s]  There were three following me. It was
[1789.18s -> 1791.87s]  these three, right? Alright, we're good.
[1791.87s -> 1804.28s]  That's cool. I'm gonna
[1804.28s -> 1817.66s]  blame that on somebody else. They want a
[1817.66s -> 1820.41s]  different window up here.
[1820.41s -> 1831.36s]  Can I break this? What did I just
[1831.36s -> 1833.66s]  do?
[1833.66s -> 1835.66s]  This might be loud. I'm warning you.
[1835.66s -> 1838.03s]  This is actually, this is probably gonna be loud. We need to test
[1838.03s -> 1840.03s]  and see. This is the loudest object in the whole game. Just be
[1840.03s -> 1848.22s]  aware of this. Is there, do I have a ladder?
[1848.22s -> 1862.22s]  Wait a minute.
[1862.22s -> 1866.57s]  Use tool grappling hook? Where's
[1866.57s -> 1877.00s]  a grappling hook? Grappling hook?
[1877.00s -> 1894.35s]  Flashlight, jump,
[1894.35s -> 1896.35s]  crouch, run. Grapple,
[1896.35s -> 1904.99s]  it's in the wheel? Oh, wait.
[1904.99s -> 1906.99s]  Wait a minute. Whoa, drone.
[1906.99s -> 1910.38s]  Oh my god. Okay.
[1910.38s -> 1917.36s]  Hold on. That's pretty cool. That's
[1917.36s -> 1919.36s]  new. That wasn't in the game before.
[1919.36s -> 1933.10s]  Alright, I'm warning you. This is loud.
[1933.10s -> 1935.10s]  I'm warning you. Please turn your volume down.
[1935.10s -> 1938.88s]  We need to test and see how loud it is.
[1938.88s -> 1941.31s]  And I knew it. I knew it was gonna be loud.
[1941.31s -> 1950.91s]  Okay, I need to upgrade
[1950.91s -> 1954.09s]  to
[1954.09s -> 1956.78s]  more faster demolition. I don't have any
[1956.78s -> 1959.79s]  of my old points, but it's alright.
[1959.79s -> 1961.79s]  Okay, so we need beds.
[1961.79s -> 1967.10s]  Get a couple of these.
[1969.34s -> 1971.34s]  Buckets, whatever.
[1971.34s -> 2007.28s]  Maybe these are dirty. Okay.
[2007.28s -> 2025.00s]  How am I gonna fit three of these?
[2025.00s -> 2027.00s]  Dude, get rid of the huge
[2027.00s -> 2031.04s]  pile of shit.
[2031.04s -> 2044.92s]  That's not just poop, isn't this?
[2044.92s -> 2046.92s]  I don't know why I was thinking of that. I didn't
[2046.92s -> 2049.10s]  finish my thought. There's another squeaks bit that was
[2049.10s -> 2051.40s]  really funny for all the
[2051.40s -> 2055.04s]  squeak maniacs that are here.
[2055.04s -> 2057.40s]  When he had the thing
[2057.40s -> 2059.40s]  transcribing him talking
[2059.40s -> 2062.03s]  and he muted his mic and just started
[2062.03s -> 2064.03s]  talking shit. And he was just
[2064.03s -> 2066.03s]  transcribing everything he said.
[2066.03s -> 2071.79s]  Pretty good. They're already gone.
[2071.79s -> 2075.95s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[2075.95s -> 2078.57s]  So why can't I place this?
[2078.57s -> 2080.57s]  Do I have to break all this first?
[2080.57s -> 2092.60s]  Yeah, see, it's like, oh, it needs to be bigger.
[2092.60s -> 2096.25s]  How do I replace this?
[2096.25s -> 2099.39s]  Sell it? Yes.
[2099.39s -> 2106.94s]  Loud. Incoming.
[2106.94s -> 2111.85s]  Oh, cool.
[2111.85s -> 2116.52s]  That's good. Look at this.
[2116.52s -> 2118.52s]  Look at how clean it is and look at how nice
[2118.52s -> 2147.52s]  it is.
[2147.52s -> 2149.52s]  Dude, it's 3am and we shouldn't be mowing.
[2149.52s -> 2167.74s]  Alright, I did it. Look at that.
[2167.74s -> 2170.11s]  So much cleaner.
[2170.11s -> 2172.80s]  All the lights are on the ground.
[2172.80s -> 2174.80s]  Oh, I
[2174.80s -> 2177.48s]  didn't do shit on the ceiling.
[2177.48s -> 2179.48s]  Uh, whoops, forgot that
[2179.48s -> 2187.04s]  was the thing I had to do.
[2187.04s -> 2201.31s]  Back home. You've received the
[2201.31s -> 2203.31s]  architect tool. Congratulations.
[2203.31s -> 2205.31s]  You've unlocked a new tool. From now on
[2205.31s -> 2207.31s]  you can build structures.
[2207.31s -> 2211.53s]  I've been playing this game for six, seven,
[2211.53s -> 2215.05s]  eight years. It's been a long time coming
[2215.05s -> 2218.83s]  for this. From now on you can build structures. Use
[2218.83s -> 2220.83s]  the architect tool and place the foundation
[2220.83s -> 2222.83s]  on the ground, then select its borders
[2222.83s -> 2225.64s]  and give it a desired shape. Okay.
[2225.64s -> 2227.64s]  Finally press the E key to erect the building.
[2227.64s -> 2231.66s]  New tool. To plot a field
[2231.66s -> 2233.66s]  select a hoe from the tools menu.
[2233.66s -> 2235.66s]  Choose a field with Q plus
[2235.66s -> 2238.41s]  that middle mouse button
[2238.41s -> 2264.01s]  and click on the ground. Okay.
[2264.01s -> 2268.81s]  House building. Paint
[2268.81s -> 2270.81s]  gun. What's the paint gun?
[2270.81s -> 2274.46s]  What? Okay.
[2274.46s -> 2280.16s]  Most of these tools are new.
[2280.16s -> 2294.43s]  Just go back here. Okay. Paint gun.
[2294.43s -> 2301.71s]  Alright. Change size.
[2301.71s -> 2312.14s]  Well, this is way faster.
[2312.14s -> 2324.80s]  That's so much faster.
[2324.80s -> 2327.74s]  Okay, cool. What about the drone?
[2327.74s -> 2337.40s]  Alright, where am I? Am I the drone?
[2337.40s -> 2353.92s]  Can I fly the drone in the house?
[2353.92s -> 2356.80s]  You can. Okay, that's weird.
[2363.84s -> 2367.68s]  What happened? What the fuck?
[2367.68s -> 2369.68s]  That thing's a cheap piece of shit.
[2369.68s -> 2379.77s]  That thing's a piece of shit. Alright, what's the next
[2379.77s -> 2384.44s]  mission? 89 missions
[2384.44s -> 2387.52s]  to do on Happy Ranch.
[2387.52s -> 2393.21s]  Huh? Wait, I can just buy one?
[2393.21s -> 2395.21s]  Wait, what do you mean I can buy a
[2395.21s -> 2424.96s]  cow? Why?
[2424.96s -> 2427.32s]  I'm just looking out and there
[2427.32s -> 2432.38s]  is a cow here. Okay.
[2432.38s -> 2434.38s]  Well, follow me because you should probably be in the...
[2434.38s -> 2439.44s]  Oh, this is a bad idea. Can I make a
[2439.44s -> 2441.44s]  bed? I need to make a cow bed.
[2441.44s -> 2453.00s]  Can you fit in here? Wait, goats?
[2453.00s -> 2455.56s]  Pigs? Horses? Sheep?
[2455.56s -> 2465.48s]  They have different personalities.
[2465.48s -> 2473.04s]  Alright, if I have like
[2473.04s -> 2475.04s]  three alpacas, four cows,
[2475.04s -> 2477.60s]  and like two goats,
[2477.60s -> 2479.60s]  the neighborhood is going to...
[2479.60s -> 2485.93s]  Oh my god. Okay, we're good.
[2485.93s -> 2488.30s]  Okay, we need a spot for you.
[2488.30s -> 2490.91s]  This is not big enough. You need a way
[2490.91s -> 2493.85s]  bigger space than this. No, fuck my
[2493.85s -> 2495.85s]  bed. I don't care. We'll get...
[2495.85s -> 2498.60s]  You need more room. No, fuck this.
[2498.60s -> 2504.73s]  Loud incoming. Oh, I can't...
[2504.73s -> 2532.24s]  Hold on. 500 bucks?
[2532.24s -> 2539.72s]  How do I... It's $3,000.
[2539.72s -> 2541.72s]  I'm working on it. I'm trying.
[2541.72s -> 2551.37s]  Hold on, you gotta get out of the way.
[2551.37s -> 2559.31s]  You can't go this way. You have to wait.
[2559.31s -> 2561.31s]  This is like wet concrete. Watch out.
[2576.89s -> 2581.63s]  I got a new skill. Design interior
[2581.63s -> 2584.76s]  walls, yes. Okay.
[2584.76s -> 2589.10s]  Building modification.
[2589.10s -> 2591.28s]  Oh, that is so cute.
[2591.28s -> 2596.01s]  Alright, come on out. Edit inner...
[2596.01s -> 2598.57s]  Select two... Press and select
[2598.57s -> 2600.57s]  two points to edit inner walls.
[2600.57s -> 2610.35s]  Points? I guess that...
[2610.35s -> 2615.15s]  How do I... Because I can move the edges,
[2615.15s -> 2617.58s]  but how do I carve off internal...
[2617.58s -> 2626.01s]  I guess. Alright, well we're both in here now.
[2626.01s -> 2635.10s]  Click and drag. I tried that. It didn't work.
[2635.10s -> 2645.84s]  I can't break it. Okay. Building
[2645.84s -> 2651.79s]  modification. Okay, now...
[2651.79s -> 2654.22s]  So I want to do this. Ah, alright.
[2654.22s -> 2656.22s]  There we go. Okay, okay. I get it.
[2656.22s -> 2661.45s]  This is the... This is where you can come in.
[2661.45s -> 2664.52s]  And you'll have a little spot.
[2664.52s -> 2669.63s]  Alright, good. Let's make a door.
[2669.63s -> 2678.52s]  Alright, this is going to be...
[2678.52s -> 2682.49s]  I need a door. Yeah, like a garage door.
[2682.49s -> 2702.12s]  Got to be big enough. You're okay?
[2702.12s -> 2708.84s]  It's like a car
[2708.84s -> 2710.84s]  garage. I know, but it'll...
[2710.84s -> 2713.79s]  You put a cow
[2713.79s -> 2715.79s]  in your garage. Dude, just wait.
[2715.79s -> 2718.35s]  Rome wasn't built in a day.
[2718.35s -> 2731.45s]  Took Rome at least a few months.
[2731.45s -> 2735.48s]  Alright, what else do you need as an animal?
[2735.48s -> 2737.98s]  Pantry? Animal products.
[2737.98s -> 2743.23s]  Everything. Okay, what do
[2743.23s -> 2747.37s]  cows eat? Hey, right?
[2747.37s -> 2768.56s]  Cows eat carrots? Cows eat carrots?
[2768.56s -> 2780.96s]  It is Otto.
[2780.96s -> 2782.96s]  In case you get hungry, there's a carrot snack
[2782.96s -> 2786.59s]  right there. This needs to be much bigger.
[2786.59s -> 2788.59s]  It's going to be way more comfortable than this.
[2788.59s -> 2790.59s]  Yeah, this is not... I don't like it
[2790.59s -> 2815.68s]  either. Uh-uh. Alright,
[2815.68s -> 2824.24s]  that's better. Okay, E.
[2824.24s -> 2831.21s]  E. I need like barn outdoor.
[2831.21s -> 2838.62s]  Okay, walls.
[2838.62s -> 2841.95s]  Wall panels, right?
[2841.95s -> 2844.12s]  It needs to be kind of like
[2844.12s -> 2860.36s]  like a barn. Like this?
[2860.36s -> 2867.20s]  Like wood? Like one of these? These
[2867.20s -> 2871.92s]  look okay. That'll be nice. Like red.
[2871.92s -> 2882.60s]  It's going to take a lot to do this because
[2882.60s -> 2897.00s]  my skill point is literally zero. Change
[2897.00s -> 2903.08s]  size? Oh, I can't. You need
[2903.08s -> 2920.17s]  one acre per cow.
[2920.17s -> 2938.60s]  I want to open windows and stuff. No,
[2938.60s -> 2940.60s]  it's not going to be a concrete room.
[2940.60s -> 2942.60s]  I have to finish the inside
[2942.60s -> 2946.57s]  first. No, you know what? I need to do my
[2946.57s -> 2952.65s]  missions, first of all. I've...
[2952.65s -> 2960.06s]  What? How?
[2960.06s -> 2966.08s]  What? Oh my goodness. This milk?
[2966.08s -> 2980.35s]  Alright, I... Hey.
[2980.35s -> 2982.35s]  Um, I wasn't ready.
[2982.35s -> 2987.45s]  Needs. No needs right now.
[2987.45s -> 2998.08s]  Alright, I need to put like hay down or something.
[2998.08s -> 3007.48s]  No shot the HOA will allow this.
[3007.48s -> 3013.23s]  Is this shit? There's no way.
[3013.23s -> 3033.63s]  Alright. Okay, I need to...
[3033.63s -> 3035.63s]  I'm going to move you to the animal hotel.
[3035.63s -> 3040.49s]  I can't take care of a cow right now.
[3040.49s -> 3047.53s]  Look, I got all this shit to do.
[3047.53s -> 3049.53s]  Are you going to go to a farm where you can be
[3049.53s -> 3062.44s]  taking care of properly? Horses?
[3062.44s -> 3064.94s]  You sell? I didn't sell. I did not sell.
[3064.94s -> 3066.94s]  The cow went to the
[3066.94s -> 3068.94s]  um, like the animal, like
[3068.94s -> 3074.64s]  farm hotel thing. I think I can go back
[3074.64s -> 3077.39s]  and get that cow later.
[3108.20s -> 3114.54s]  Do I have to actually
[3114.54s -> 3118.38s]  get horses here?
[3118.38s -> 3120.38s]  How does this work?
[3128.59s -> 3141.00s]  How does this work?
[3141.00s -> 3164.67s]  Oh, okay.
[3164.67s -> 3166.67s]  Oh shit, it's going to roll into the...
[3166.67s -> 3168.67s]  Somebody's... Whoa! There it goes.
[3168.67s -> 3172.06s]  I actually just took out... That would have been bad.
[3172.06s -> 3180.49s]  Just...
[3180.49s -> 3184.52s]  Okay, wait. How many do you want me to take down?
[3184.52s -> 3186.52s]  Cut down tree... Oh, these...
[3186.52s -> 3196.76s]  Wait. Where are the... Where are the ones
[3196.76s -> 3200.99s]  you must cut down? Oh,
[3200.99s -> 3218.27s]  oops. Sorry about that. I want to try to use
[3218.27s -> 3225.37s]  the axe too. How does the axe work?
[3225.37s -> 3227.37s]  No, we just only use chainsaw.
[3227.37s -> 3232.75s]  Alright, put this down. Alright, lay foundation.
[3232.75s -> 3234.75s]  So you want me to put down a foundation
[3234.75s -> 3237.56s]  here. I need to build
[3237.56s -> 3241.15s]  a stable. Okay.
[3241.15s -> 3265.71s]  Let's go.
[3265.71s -> 3274.54s]  Alright, done? Cool. So now...
[3274.54s -> 3280.11s]  Oh, I'm so glad there's a guide.
[3280.11s -> 3283.12s]  Alright, so now we need to make a stable.
[3283.12s -> 3286.76s]  Knee, knee horse
[3286.76s -> 3294.25s]  box gate. You want the gray
[3294.25s -> 3301.42s]  tile? Okay. Do this first.
[3301.42s -> 3315.10s]  You should do this IRL.
[3315.10s -> 3319.90s]  I just want to make sure you understand that.
[3319.90s -> 3325.52s]  Like, I don't...
[3325.52s -> 3329.16s]  I would probably get seriously injured.
[3329.16s -> 3331.79s]  You want me to build a house?
[3331.79s -> 3334.03s]  Like, build this?
[3334.03s -> 3343.10s]  Huh? Yeah.
[3343.10s -> 3358.38s]  Okay, that looks good.
[3358.38s -> 3360.38s]  Somebody said caveman. I could make some caveman
[3360.38s -> 3362.38s]  level stuff, but not like this.
[3362.38s -> 3364.38s]  You need skill training
[3364.38s -> 3370.68s]  and safety.
[3370.68s -> 3372.68s]  Okay, so I need to get this.
[3372.68s -> 3375.24s]  This interior has got to be way better
[3375.24s -> 3386.96s]  than this. Three of these?
[3386.96s -> 3401.21s]  Is that not counting it? Why is it only counting
[3401.21s -> 3419.20s]  one? I don't think I can make it perfect.
[3419.20s -> 3435.96s]  Zero out of four?
[3435.96s -> 3438.20s]  Wait, why did it...what?
[3438.20s -> 3444.46s]  Alright, this is not
[3444.46s -> 3455.28s]  a me problem. I can't
[3455.28s -> 3460.01s]  get it perfect. Put the pillars first.
[3460.01s -> 3476.51s]  Try that.
[3476.51s -> 3488.92s]  Alright, that counted.
[3488.92s -> 3490.92s]  Jeremy, your problem solving skills suck.
[3490.92s -> 3497.71s]  This was one out of four.
[3497.71s -> 3500.27s]  I picked it up and put it down in the same spot
[3500.27s -> 3502.89s]  and it went to zero out of four.
[3502.89s -> 3505.20s]  The instructions were incorrect.
[3505.20s -> 3527.77s]  There we go. That's a dad excuse.
[3527.77s -> 3530.91s]  The instructions
[3530.91s -> 3539.93s]  were not correct. It's really not
[3539.93s -> 3541.93s]  hard. No, it's not.
[3541.93s -> 3547.42s]  I just did it. It's
[3547.42s -> 3551.45s]  kind of finicky. How come I wasn't doing this
[3551.45s -> 3553.45s]  too...okay, so the pillars definitely had to be
[3553.45s -> 3555.45s]  here. Because it would not let me go
[3555.45s -> 3557.45s]  in this exact spot before.
[3557.45s -> 3559.45s]  Before it was like I could only place it like here.
[3559.45s -> 3572.76s]  Am I missing tiles somewhere?
[3572.76s -> 3586.89s]  Oh, come on. Okay.
[3586.89s -> 3593.55s]  So this thing is
[3593.55s -> 3599.29s]  for here.
[3599.29s -> 3601.72s]  Oh, that was a lag spike. Wait, what does it want this?
[3601.72s -> 3604.60s]  Half box wall.
[3604.60s -> 3627.95s]  Wait, let me do that first.
[3627.95s -> 3660.96s]  Oh, please. Change
[3660.96s -> 3662.96s]  the music. This is the music in the game.
[3662.96s -> 3667.63s]  And this thing goes hard.
[3667.63s -> 3675.12s]  I'm keeping it on. No, we can't replace
[3675.12s -> 3677.12s]  every soundtrack with Doom
[3677.12s -> 3697.34s]  OST. Alright, so these are the
[3697.34s -> 3702.08s]  windows. Horse mats.
[3702.08s -> 3731.36s]  Okay. Four of these, right? Okay.
[3731.36s -> 3738.52s]  So what now?
[3738.52s -> 3743.52s]  Two of these go here. No.
[3743.52s -> 3754.25s]  Smash. I'm starting to understand
[3754.25s -> 3762.56s]  it. I think I can make my own farm.
[3762.56s -> 3773.04s]  Looks pretty clean. Where's
[3773.04s -> 3777.00s]  the door? I'll worry about that later.
[3777.00s -> 3783.32s]  Look, there's a door. Oh, that's
[3783.32s -> 3785.32s]  not a door. That's a giant
[3785.32s -> 3787.32s]  window. Where is the door?
[3787.32s -> 3809.53s]  Wait, where's the door? I need a
[3809.53s -> 3813.69s]  door. Sliding gate.
[3813.69s -> 3825.90s]  Hey, we're good.
[3825.90s -> 3828.91s]  Now, ceiling lamp.
[3828.91s -> 3833.96s]  Empty shelf with horse care equipment.
[3833.96s -> 3843.23s]  I don't know, put it like right here. How many
[3843.23s -> 3860.25s]  horse feeders for? This looks like
[3860.25s -> 3865.05s]  my high school?
[3865.05s -> 3869.28s]  What?
[3869.28s -> 3876.57s]  What are you talking about? Are you
[3876.57s -> 3882.27s]  a horse?
[3882.27s -> 3884.27s]  This looks just like my high
[3884.27s -> 3896.04s]  school. Alright, that looks good.
[3896.04s -> 3906.78s]  I'm starting to get it. So
[3906.78s -> 3908.78s]  it's a Minecraft house. Somebody
[3908.78s -> 3910.78s]  came into this universe with the Minecraft tools.
[3910.78s -> 3917.24s]  My game got
[3917.24s -> 3919.80s]  hacked by some like Minecraft player.
[3919.80s -> 3921.80s]  And they're just building in my game.
[3921.80s -> 3935.36s]  Okay. So now
[3935.36s -> 3941.05s]  I want us to see the
[3941.05s -> 3943.05s]  just in case we get introduced into the
[3943.05s -> 3951.48s]  gameplay mechanic.
[3951.48s -> 3953.85s]  Um, I think I'm going to buy it.
[3953.85s -> 3958.01s]  I got money. Let's buy the new house.
[3958.01s -> 3961.20s]  Cabin in the woods.
[3961.20s -> 3963.20s]  A remote getaway in the heart of the mountains.
[3963.20s -> 3965.37s]  An easy sell. Just needs a little love to
[3965.37s -> 3967.37s]  become the site of a joyful family gathering
[3967.37s -> 3969.37s]  once again. Or anything else you'd like it to be.
[3969.37s -> 3979.02s]  I'm buying it. Let's check it out.
[3979.02s -> 3983.31s]  This is the new house in the update.
[3983.31s -> 4000.76s]  This place is very dirty. Garden
[4000.76s -> 4003.20s]  con- oh, that's right. Alright.
[4003.20s -> 4007.53s]  It's time for the game to begin. What do I
[4007.53s -> 4010.41s]  got for- ooh. What do I got for
[4010.41s -> 4014.57s]  space in this lot? First thing is first.
[4014.57s -> 4021.79s]  Yeah, we'll change the music. Yeah.
[4021.79s -> 4024.86s]  I didn't want to hear it another time. Uh.
[4024.86s -> 4026.86s]  Hey, how's Doom
[4026.86s -> 4033.12s]  OST sound?
[4033.12s -> 4042.52s]  No, something else. Something else.
[4042.52s -> 4051.66s]  Something else. Ooh, it's raining.
[4051.66s -> 4053.66s]  Ooh, this is going to be so fucking
[4053.66s -> 4058.91s]  relaxing. I can't wait.
[4058.91s -> 4061.85s]  Stardew Valley music? That's not a bad
[4061.85s -> 4066.72s]  thing to put on. Stardew
[4066.72s -> 4071.00s]  OST. Yeah, it's like just
[4071.00s -> 4081.12s]  so, it's just so nice.
[4081.12s -> 4088.99s]  How's that? Good? I want to be
[4088.99s -> 4099.42s]  nice and in the background.
[4099.42s -> 4107.04s]  Okay. I'm going to plant my own trees,
[4107.04s -> 4111.71s]  I think. Can you?
[4111.71s -> 4114.46s]  Alright. Well, that's fine. First,
[4114.46s -> 4116.46s]  most important thing, we've
[4116.46s -> 4118.46s]  got to clean this up. This
[4118.46s -> 4120.46s]  yaw has got to be a grass
[4120.46s -> 4133.13s]  cut.
[4133.13s -> 4135.50s]  Stardew music
[4135.50s -> 4137.50s]  in the background.
[4137.50s -> 4142.94s]  I feel like I'm going to mess something up if I do it that
[4142.94s -> 4156.70s]  way. I'm going to turn these sounds down
[4156.70s -> 4167.96s]  just a little bit. Lawn mowing
[4167.96s -> 4169.96s]  simulator. Oh, I still want to change the auto
[4169.96s -> 4175.00s]  saving. How do I do that?
[4175.00s -> 4177.00s]  Click save. Three minutes. Yeah.
[4177.00s -> 4179.00s]  Like 30, 15
[4179.00s -> 4182.46s]  is good. Every three minutes
[4182.46s -> 4191.28s]  is a lot. Okay, here we go.
[4191.28s -> 4193.28s]  Ah, this is what I'm talking about.
[4193.28s -> 4200.00s]  This way we can get
[4200.00s -> 4203.90s]  rid of all the weeds. I should get some upgrades
[4203.90s -> 4211.71s]  for doing this. You like firehouse
[4211.71s -> 4215.40s]  subs? Yeah. Firehouse
[4215.40s -> 4217.40s]  is good. I've had it a few times before.
[4217.40s -> 4233.77s]  Let me move this back here.
[4233.77s -> 4236.52s]  I got a big lot. It's going to take me a minute.
[4236.52s -> 4243.16s]  Look at those mountains. It already looks
[4243.16s -> 4257.95s]  10 times better. Okay.
[4257.95s -> 4274.51s]  It's burnt? It is burnt.
[4274.51s -> 4277.71s]  Oh, no.
[4277.71s -> 4282.51s]  Yeah, it is burnt. Can I restart?
[4282.51s -> 4290.38s]  Yeah, it's all burnt up. Will that get
[4290.38s -> 4292.38s]  fixed, I think? I can plant some stuff there.
[4292.38s -> 4296.14s]  I'll make that. We'll turn
[4296.14s -> 4298.14s]  that into like some kind of pen or something.
[4298.14s -> 4309.58s]  Yeah, what does it replant? It's fine.
[4309.58s -> 4311.58s]  Can you make a koi pond?
[4311.58s -> 4321.76s]  Try. Where are the pigs? Hurry up and
[4321.76s -> 4326.16s]  spawn them in. Patience.
[4326.16s -> 4329.42s]  Yeah, usually I'm the one without the patience.
[4329.42s -> 4331.42s]  We need to prepare our pen.
[4331.42s -> 4334.43s]  We can make sure our animals are taken very good
[4334.43s -> 4343.26s]  care of. All right, that's good enough
[4343.26s -> 4345.95s]  enough. I want to see the- what's the damage
[4345.95s -> 4354.46s]  in the interior?
[4354.46s -> 4371.40s]  Oof. Oh, dear.
[4371.40s -> 4380.99s]  Oh, boy. All right, we're working
[4380.99s -> 4383.29s]  from top- we're working
[4383.29s -> 4401.72s]  top down. Looks good.
[4401.72s -> 4403.72s]  What is all this? Oh, no. Get rid of this.
[4403.72s -> 4416.65s]  Now, what if all the animals
[4416.65s -> 4418.65s]  lived in the house and I lived in the barn?
[4418.65s -> 4434.57s]  Like, they live in the house.
[4434.57s -> 4436.57s]  That's just an 80s comedy.
[4436.57s -> 4444.04s]  Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, I want
[4444.04s -> 4446.04s]  I want the pig to have an office.
[4446.04s -> 4458.12s]  What's going on with this thing?
[4458.12s -> 4463.29s]  Junk. Get rid of it. Junk. Junk.
[4463.29s -> 4473.90s]  This one's pretty good. It's kind
[4473.90s -> 4481.58s]  of dreary in here. Whose room is this
[4481.58s -> 4486.12s]  going to be? By the way, we can get
[4486.12s -> 4490.41s]  Whose room is this going to be? Should be the pig's
[4490.41s -> 4492.84s]  room? Who would want a good view like this?
[4492.84s -> 4498.65s]  A goat? All right, so this is going to be a goat
[4498.65s -> 4511.18s]  room. What do you think we'll paint?
[4511.18s -> 4516.94s]  Let's start from the bottom. Floor. Carpet?
[4516.94s -> 4532.99s]  Can we put grass up here? It kind of looks like
[4532.99s -> 4541.48s]  grass. Nah.
[4541.48s -> 4545.76s]  Farming. Whoa!
[4545.76s -> 4558.28s]  It really is Stardew.
[4558.28s -> 4560.28s]  All right, where do I want my, what am I growing?
[4560.28s -> 4564.62s]  Right here. All right, I want to make
[4564.62s -> 4566.80s]  a bunch of sunflowers.
[4566.80s -> 4569.68s]  So I need to, what was it? It was a
[4569.68s -> 4580.60s]  certain tool, right? Yep, here it is.
[4580.60s -> 4583.16s]  Corn's going to go here. No, sunflower will go
[4583.16s -> 4610.49s]  here. Make a corn maze.
[4610.49s -> 4614.65s]  All right, I'll do that in the backyard.
[4614.65s -> 4623.93s]  That's a good idea. I like that. Yeah,
[4623.93s -> 4625.93s]  I'll make like a tower defense
[4625.93s -> 4627.93s]  pathing thing over there.
[4627.93s -> 4631.52s]  You have to walk through and then go
[4631.52s -> 4633.52s]  this way and then there's a huge tower defense maze.
[4633.52s -> 4640.54s]  But first of all, sunflower seeds.
[4640.54s -> 4643.23s]  So where do I put them?
[4643.23s -> 4646.92s]  Is that it? Do I have to water them too?
[4646.92s -> 4658.70s]  Plants versus zombies map?
[4658.70s -> 4661.64s]  Yeah, I could do two rows of sunflowers
[4661.64s -> 4664.65s]  and then just, that's a good idea too.
[4664.65s -> 4676.11s]  All right, so if that's the sunflowers
[4676.11s -> 4678.80s]  then what would go right in front of it?
[4678.80s -> 4683.72s]  Pumpkins, carrots.
[4683.72s -> 4687.82s]  I think this is it. We've got tomatoes,
[4687.82s -> 4690.43s]  pumpkins, potatoes, corn
[4690.43s -> 4697.08s]  and carrots. Tomatoes, right?
[4697.08s -> 4700.80s]  Corn makes, we're doing a plants versus zombies
[4700.80s -> 4708.16s]  thing. This is in the game. What just happened?
[4708.16s -> 4725.55s]  Did I just plant corn here? Okay.
[4725.55s -> 4732.12s]  Let's have it come out a little bit further.
[4732.12s -> 4734.12s]  I also have to put a bunch of bad placement
[4734.12s -> 4736.12s]  because when I played plants versus zombies it was terrible
[4736.12s -> 4738.62s]  placement so we're going to have like two or three
[4738.62s -> 4740.62s]  pumpkins and then two or three corns and then
[4740.62s -> 4754.25s]  yeah, we'll make sure it's accurate. What happens
[4754.25s -> 4756.68s]  if you torch it all? Then it all goes away?
[4756.68s -> 4765.52s]  I don't want to do that. Got one row corn,
[4765.52s -> 4768.01s]  two rows sunflowers.
[4768.01s -> 4771.21s]  Does anything look like a walnut? Probably
[4771.21s -> 4777.87s]  the pumpkin I would imagine.
[4777.87s -> 4779.87s]  There's a zombie
[4779.87s -> 4781.87s]  in my lawn.
[4781.87s -> 4783.87s]  There's a zombie.
[4783.87s -> 4808.43s]  Walnut, walnut down here
[4808.43s -> 4812.08s]  and then we'll put
[4812.08s -> 4815.28s]  a couple more
[4815.28s -> 4819.95s]  we'll do a couple more corns like just kind of scattered
[4819.95s -> 4821.95s]  in a row like right here.
[4821.95s -> 4847.98s]  We'll see how that turns out. I just want
[4847.98s -> 4855.15s]  to see what it did.
[4855.15s -> 4857.15s]  We're thinking way too, hold on
[4857.15s -> 4877.95s]  I need to water this stuff. Maybe you don't.
[4877.95s -> 4883.00s]  Hey, it's a process.
[4883.00s -> 4886.59s]  We didn't get right to the
[4886.59s -> 4888.59s]  Best Buy. We didn't get right to
[4888.59s -> 4891.08s]  the mall a few years
[4891.08s -> 4895.05s]  ago. The process is we get
[4895.05s -> 4897.05s]  we will
[4897.05s -> 4899.05s]  we, we, we
[4899.05s -> 4912.43s]  I want all new stuff.
[4912.43s -> 4917.16s]  Now you bet your ass there's going to be a
[4917.16s -> 4919.16s]  like four by foot
[4919.16s -> 4921.16s]  four by five whatever foot
[4921.16s -> 4924.17s]  square footed, square pool.
[4924.17s -> 4935.56s]  I want a square pool.
[4935.56s -> 4937.56s]  I don't know is it five by five? Is it
[4937.56s -> 4945.31s]  eight by eight? How big is it?
[4945.31s -> 4961.24s]  Wait, getting ahead of myself. Four by five
[4961.24s -> 4965.92s]  is fine for you. Permanently ban that
[4965.92s -> 4968.35s]  person for an hour and then reduce
[4968.35s -> 4972.06s]  their sentence by 55 minutes and leave
[4972.06s -> 4977.44s]  them a stern message. All right, let's start
[4977.44s -> 4979.44s]  with doing one room at a time and
[4979.44s -> 4982.25s]  let me tell you I don't like that at all.
[4982.25s -> 4985.13s]  I don't like that at all and I don't like that
[4985.13s -> 4988.40s]  light. So if this was if I'm coming up the
[4988.40s -> 4991.21s]  stairs here I would probably say this
[4991.21s -> 4994.09s]  is a
[4994.09s -> 4996.65s]  could be like an office or something or could be
[4996.65s -> 5005.04s]  a bedroom. Floor is important. What do I want
[5005.04s -> 5010.41s]  on the floor up here? There are beehives.
[5010.41s -> 5035.10s]  Do I have to do anything with them?
[5035.10s -> 5037.10s]  Is there any like special interactions?
[5037.10s -> 5039.66s]  This might just be aesthetic.
[5039.66s -> 5041.66s]  I don't think it actually does anything.
[5041.66s -> 5060.52s]  Okay, one thing at a time. Let's go
[5060.52s -> 5062.52s]  to floors.
[5062.52s -> 5067.77s]  We'll just do wood. Doesn't matter.
[5067.77s -> 5075.07s]  I don't like wood floors though.
[5075.07s -> 5081.00s]  I really don't. Too much to upkeep.
[5081.00s -> 5083.69s]  You can fuck them up. You can scratch them up.
[5083.69s -> 5098.48s]  I don't like it. Green tiles are fine.
[5098.48s -> 5104.24s]  I don't mind this.
[5104.24s -> 5115.47s]  What does this look like? It's not a farmhouse
[5115.47s -> 5118.09s]  without wood. That's true.
[5118.09s -> 5132.80s]  I need some light in here. Something really basic.
[5132.80s -> 5144.41s]  Eater. There it is.
[5144.41s -> 5148.25s]  No, there it is. That's the exact
[5148.25s -> 5152.09s]  one that I want. Yeah, that is
[5152.09s -> 5155.10s]  exactly the one.
[5155.10s -> 5161.44s]  And I want this shit to be teal.
[5161.44s -> 5167.88s]  Yup. There it is.
[5167.88s -> 5177.15s]  Oh my goodness. Yes.
[5177.15s -> 5183.80s]  Where can I put this? I don't care
[5183.80s -> 5185.80s]  if my whole house looks like this.
[5185.80s -> 5187.80s]  As long as I got my square pool.
[5187.80s -> 5192.73s]  That's all I care about. Does it have to be
[5192.73s -> 5202.14s]  in the yard? I think it has to be outside.
[5202.14s -> 5212.88s]  Not enough room. It's not enough
[5212.88s -> 5222.03s]  room. Yeah, it said it. How come I can't
[5222.03s -> 5227.98s]  put it in there? There's plenty of room.
[5227.98s -> 5234.94s]  Look at all the room right here. How come I can't
[5234.94s -> 5239.80s]  It doesn't have to go up against a wall.
[5239.80s -> 5245.18s]  There's plenty of space here. Because it's on
[5245.18s -> 5247.18s]  the second floor. So, what? I can't
[5247.18s -> 5250.96s]  have a second floor square pool? Bullshit.
[5250.96s -> 5276.60s]  Let's pick all this up. I might just
[5276.60s -> 5279.42s]  put it in the kitchen. Wait a minute. This is not even my house.
[5279.42s -> 5286.27s]  We're doing the
[5286.27s -> 5288.27s]  switching. We're switching around here. The animals
[5288.27s -> 5309.13s]  are gonna live in here. We just gotta clear everything first.
[5309.13s -> 5311.82s]  Get a good look at exactly how
[5311.82s -> 5326.59s]  the whole thing is set up. Okay.
[5326.59s -> 5340.27s]  Clean up. I do work at a hotel
[5340.27s -> 5344.94s]  and the pool is on the 10th floor.
[5344.94s -> 5350.12s]  Yeah, that's also a hotel though. Alright.
[5350.12s -> 5353.13s]  Now, just clean up first.
[5353.13s -> 5355.95s]  I keep getting distracted and that's
[5355.95s -> 5367.84s]  gonna stop. Just clean up. I can't wait to see the
[5367.84s -> 5370.46s]  before and after after this one. It's gonna be so awesome.
[5370.46s -> 5389.18s]  Open. What's in there? This place
[5389.18s -> 5396.16s]  is kind of like gross.
[5396.16s -> 5407.87s]  I aired out a little. I want some more cleaning points.
[5407.87s -> 5411.82s]  This map is kind of low
[5411.82s -> 5423.00s]  on the list here. Where's this
[5423.00s -> 5431.18s]  dirt? See the minimap? Oh, right there.
[5431.18s -> 5442.16s]  Clean. On to the next room.
[5442.16s -> 5444.16s]  Beetle update? I have not gotten them yet.
[5444.16s -> 5452.52s]  I do want to get them. That's probably
[5452.52s -> 5455.60s]  a summer thing. I don't
[5455.60s -> 5458.72s]  think death feigning
[5458.72s -> 5461.60s]  blue death feigning beetles, I believe.
[5461.60s -> 5465.98s]  That's more soon
[5465.98s -> 5483.20s]  than it is the cold months. You think you'd still be
[5483.20s -> 5485.20s]  the house flipper guy if you weren't
[5485.20s -> 5488.59s]  me? Well, I don't know. I
[5488.59s -> 5492.35s]  wouldn't be me. So, I don't know.
[5492.35s -> 5506.43s]  Probably not. Have you seen the new Zelda trailer?
[5506.43s -> 5508.43s]  No, I'm not allowed to see the new Zelda
[5508.43s -> 5530.32s]  trailer until I finish my homework. Yeah, I need to finish
[5530.32s -> 5535.69s]  Breath of the Wild. There might be spoilers in there.
[5535.69s -> 5542.67s]  Alright, have we done all the interior rooms besides
[5542.67s -> 5554.96s]  the hallway? On the bottom floor at least.
[5554.96s -> 5558.99s]  You are never gonna finish Breath of
[5558.99s -> 5565.63s]  the Wild. How can you be so sure? I gotta pick up
[5565.63s -> 5567.63s]  individual playing cards.
[5567.63s -> 5582.01s]  Ugh. Take out the flame? You can't use a
[5582.01s -> 5594.62s]  flamethrower. Oh, wait, you can. Well,
[5594.62s -> 5609.72s]  I feel like the guy in the neighborhood that is going
[5609.72s -> 5614.08s]  way too far on Halloween. No, no.
[5614.08s -> 5616.08s]  You don't understand. Every window has to
[5616.08s -> 5618.08s]  have demon fire come out of it.
[5618.08s -> 5629.15s]  Every ten minutes. It's gotta
[5629.15s -> 5635.61s]  be on a fifteen minute timer. Well,
[5635.61s -> 5642.84s]  that was much easier. I kinda feel
[5642.84s -> 5646.62s]  bad that I can... I feel like this is
[5646.62s -> 5651.72s]  cheating. I'm cheating right now. This is
[5651.72s -> 5678.27s]  cheating. Where is this spot? How
[5678.27s -> 5689.98s]  have I not cleaned it yet? Where is it? I have
[5689.98s -> 5694.72s]  no idea where this is. It's apparently in here.
[5694.72s -> 5722.08s]  I don't think it's outside. Where is it?
[5722.08s -> 5724.08s]  It's a mug on the floor.
[5724.08s -> 5733.48s]  I think that's plumbing. Yeah, that's just plumbing
[5733.48s -> 5737.32s]  for the toilet. But I don't know if this is gonna be the bathroom
[5737.32s -> 5742.83s]  so I don't know. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's
[5742.83s -> 5756.96s]  over here. Really? Upstairs?
[5756.96s -> 5777.05s]  Where do you hide your weed stash?
[5777.05s -> 5782.41s]  Um, well, if you're
[5782.41s -> 5784.41s]  over twenty-one, marijuana is
[5784.41s -> 5788.00s]  illegal in Las Vegas. I mean,
[5788.00s -> 5803.61s]  hide it. Aren't you nineteen?
[5803.61s -> 5841.04s]  Get out of here. I'm gonna gas.
[5841.04s -> 5863.93s]  Alright, let's start taking some walls down.
[5863.93s -> 5873.07s]  Fix the fuse box. Fixed.
[5873.07s -> 5875.07s]  I have points to put in. What am I doing? Alright.
[5875.07s -> 5880.43s]  Faster. Let's do that.
[5880.43s -> 5883.76s]  More demolition. More strength.
[5883.76s -> 5885.76s]  And job requirements. Sound pretty good.
[5885.76s -> 5906.48s]  Ooh! Look!
[5906.48s -> 5921.37s]  It's going to start. Cleanup's going pretty
[5921.37s -> 5927.84s]  well. There's one issue there.
[5927.84s -> 5933.15s]  This is clean. This is clean.
[5933.15s -> 5946.14s]  Yeah, I got the Stardew Valley soundtrack playing in the
[5946.14s -> 5956.49s]  background to make it extra comfortable.
[5956.49s -> 5961.53s]  I think this is permanent. Yeah, it is.
[5961.53s -> 5963.53s]  Who puked up that high on the wall?
[5963.53s -> 5968.08s]  You have to stand up here
[5968.08s -> 5970.32s]  and aim this way to
[5970.32s -> 5983.05s]  puke up at the ceiling. We're going to get all new bathroom
[5983.05s -> 5986.12s]  stuff anyways. Yeah, we're
[5986.12s -> 6006.27s]  going to do that. Remove the whole
[6006.27s -> 6009.28s]  bathroom? I might once everything's clean.
[6009.28s -> 6012.09s]  Design does not happen until everything is
[6012.09s -> 6018.11s]  clean. So all the HGTV
[6018.11s -> 6020.11s]  Andes can hold on
[6020.11s -> 6050.36s]  a second. There's dirt up here. Okay,
[6050.36s -> 6058.48s]  this is kind of cool. Where is it?
[6058.48s -> 6074.41s]  I got it. Okay, thank goodness.
[6074.41s -> 6104.62s]  Where? Okay, it's the
[6104.62s -> 6124.97s]  painting frames. One more? Where
[6124.97s -> 6140.01s]  is it? Yes, thank goodness. All right,
[6140.01s -> 6154.35s]  we're good. Yeah, the grappling hook was added
[6154.35s -> 6163.50s]  three days ago. Changing this.
[6163.50s -> 6169.88s]  I might just remove this and we'll put something
[6169.88s -> 6176.54s]  else in. Yeah, I want a different staircase than that.
[6176.54s -> 6212.56s]  Okay, we build our
[6212.56s -> 6231.10s]  own rooms. Hey, my birthday
[6231.10s -> 6233.10s]  is 420. Can you get faded
[6233.10s -> 6235.10s]  and play back rooms on Roblox?
[6235.10s -> 6242.76s]  Uh, I don't
[6242.76s -> 6257.92s]  think so. There we go.
[6257.92s -> 6266.30s]  Much better. I might even take this wall down
[6266.30s -> 6271.21s]  too and just have a bathroom.
[6271.21s -> 6286.49s]  We'll see. You promised.
[6286.49s -> 6303.58s]  I didn't promise a 420 stream. No,
[6303.58s -> 6305.58s]  on 420, I'm going to be sitting
[6305.58s -> 6308.46s]  on my own couch watching old
[6308.46s -> 6311.72s]  Fraggle Rock episodes. I'm
[6311.72s -> 6319.15s]  going to be very busy. I'm going to be incredibly
[6319.15s -> 6329.20s]  busy. You're going to do that without us?
[6329.20s -> 6340.65s]  All right, stairs.
[6340.65s -> 6350.24s]  I want it so bad right now.
[6350.24s -> 6352.24s]  We need a way to go up and down.
[6352.24s -> 6359.64s]  Hmm. How are animals
[6359.64s -> 6365.90s]  going to use this? They're just not
[6365.90s -> 6368.59s]  on pivoting. The bottom floor is where
[6368.59s -> 6370.59s]  the animals live and the top floor is where
[6370.59s -> 6385.12s]  I live. And it's just going to be made out of gold
[6385.12s -> 6399.76s]  ladder. Yeah, I want there to be as much
[6399.76s -> 6401.76s]  real estate as possible to put other stuff.
[6401.76s -> 6406.75s]  Stairwell takes actually a very
[6406.75s -> 6424.73s]  large amount of space. That's the worst
[6424.73s -> 6427.36s]  possible place. Wait, where's the front door?
[6427.36s -> 6429.36s]  Where's the door? How do I get out of here?
[6429.36s -> 6433.82s]  How do I get out of this house?
[6433.82s -> 6435.82s]  Oh, okay. Uh-uh. I don't like this.
[6435.82s -> 6439.28s]  No, front door is right here. Yeah,
[6439.28s -> 6472.99s]  front door is right here. There. Because the bottom
[6472.99s -> 6493.66s]  floor is going to be the barn. Yeah, the upstairs
[6493.66s -> 6496.09s]  is going to be where I live. But there's going
[6496.09s -> 6499.55s]  to be, I'm sorry, but dad gets
[6499.55s -> 6501.85s]  to have one room down here. And I'll make,
[6501.85s -> 6507.68s]  I'll section it off right now. Garage?
[6507.68s -> 6514.14s]  I think that's fair. I had a dad room
[6514.14s -> 6529.56s]  before though. This needs to go over here.
[6529.56s -> 6555.87s]  This is, I'm claiming this is mine.
[6555.87s -> 6563.15s]  Either this one or this one. I like this one.
[6563.15s -> 6584.32s]  Get the color, right? Yeah.
[6592.25s -> 6595.13s]  I have no idea how to fucking swim.
[6595.13s -> 6605.42s]  I probably should remove this. I can
[6605.42s -> 6617.24s]  stand in here.
[6617.24s -> 6619.24s]  I'm happy. I don't even need to play the game anymore. I'm done.
[6619.24s -> 6622.32s]  This room is going to be immaculate.
[6622.32s -> 6624.68s]  Just wait. Check this out.
[6624.68s -> 6627.76s]  I'm going to get pool lights all over
[6627.76s -> 6642.46s]  here. Hmm. All right.
[6642.46s -> 6644.46s]  What should I, I want like lighting, like
[6644.46s -> 6651.63s]  really nice lighting. What do you think?
[6651.63s -> 6658.48s]  Tile? That nice kind of
[6658.48s -> 6671.79s]  clean tile look on the walls? Of course.
[6671.79s -> 6675.18s]  Oh yeah, of course. Roulette table?
[6675.18s -> 6679.96s]  Okay. Oh yeah, this is perfect. I'll put
[6679.96s -> 6685.15s]  that somewhere else in a minute. Wait,
[6685.15s -> 6693.21s]  I gotta make a casino? All right. This is
[6693.21s -> 6702.81s]  going to be a farm and a casino at the same time.
[6702.81s -> 6705.76s]  That's so stupid. All right. Don't
[6705.76s -> 6710.11s]  get distracted. So bathroom.
[6710.11s -> 6728.35s]  What should it be? What should the colors be?
[6728.35s -> 6734.28s]  Just like a light blue? Green?
[6734.28s -> 6754.94s]  These are pretty default, but they look
[6754.94s -> 6760.17s]  good. Marble? Marble sounds good.
[6760.17s -> 6762.41s]  This looks kind of good. Wait a minute.
[6762.41s -> 6775.71s]  Look at this. Let me see what it looks like. That's
[6775.71s -> 6813.00s]  pretty sharp. What about the floor?
[6813.00s -> 6844.54s]  That's a good floor. Make the floor?
[6844.54s -> 6846.54s]  That's a great comment. Bro, you just
[6846.54s -> 6852.62s]  made a baptism room.
[6852.62s -> 6855.74s]  No. This is
[6855.74s -> 6869.31s]  my personal sanctuary.
[6869.31s -> 6871.31s]  It's a barn, a church,
[6871.31s -> 6876.24s]  and a casino. Oh man.
[6876.24s -> 6882.43s]  I don't think
[6882.43s -> 6884.43s]  I don't think you can get permits to have a casino
[6884.43s -> 6887.95s]  and a church in the same space.
[6887.95s -> 6889.95s]  I don't think that's how it works.
[6889.95s -> 6894.49s]  I think there'd be quite a few people that would have things to say about that.
[6894.49s -> 6897.56s]  I would imagine.
[6897.56s -> 6907.47s]  Baptism chamber.
[6907.47s -> 6909.47s]  Everyone's saying fix the tub.
[6909.47s -> 6916.00s]  Hold on. I can't.
[6916.00s -> 6918.92s]  I think it's like this permanently. Unless I sell
[6918.92s -> 6930.51s]  it. Well, that's definitely the walls for sure.
[6930.51s -> 6941.63s]  I actually really like it. The outlet?
[6941.63s -> 6948.41s]  Yeah, this is a little
[6948.41s -> 6950.65s]  fucked up, but it's all right. Everything's going to be fine.
[6950.65s -> 6973.16s]  Nice. This is a saw death trap.
[6973.16s -> 6978.01s]  It's not done. If
[6978.01s -> 6980.01s]  you were constructing a house and somebody walked over and saw
[6980.01s -> 6982.51s]  the frame and went,
[6982.51s -> 6984.51s]  Hey, are you making a saw death trap?
[6984.51s -> 6988.35s]  The house is not done.
[6988.35s -> 6996.41s]  How are the sunflowers doing? Good
[6996.41s -> 7001.45s]  question. Ooh, pretty nicely
[7001.45s -> 7017.12s]  it seems. Pumpkins are not done.
[7017.12s -> 7019.61s]  I just got a bunch of corn. Oh.
[7019.61s -> 7023.71s]  I wonder, do I feed this to animals?
[7023.71s -> 7031.31s]  I would imagine. Plus six corn.
[7031.31s -> 7042.94s]  That's kind of cool.
[7042.94s -> 7045.63s]  Animals provide 50% more produce.
[7045.63s -> 7047.63s]  50% increased growth rate of crops.
[7047.63s -> 7057.42s]  Which one of these is better? Probably this one.
[7057.42s -> 7060.17s]  No, I probably won't do it.
[7060.17s -> 7064.57s]  Oh, it's done. Pumpkin?
[7064.57s -> 7073.28s]  Maybe animals provide more produce?
[7073.28s -> 7079.47s]  Whoa. I'm
[7079.47s -> 7086.83s]  harvesting all the sunflowers. I probably
[7086.83s -> 7103.98s]  make animal food. Seems pretty good.
[7103.98s -> 7115.48s]  All right. Back to what we were doing. It'd be so
[7115.48s -> 7123.42s]  funny if you could play. We gotta get a better door than
[7123.42s -> 7130.27s]  this. This thing sucks. All right.
[7130.27s -> 7132.70s]  I'm walking in. I want misters.
[7132.70s -> 7136.14s]  I want kind of scented
[7136.14s -> 7138.32s]  misters to be spraying
[7138.32s -> 7140.49s]  at an angle here and here.
[7140.49s -> 7144.51s]  Right at the door. I want to get coated
[7144.51s -> 7146.75s]  by like a nice gentle mist.
[7146.75s -> 7154.22s]  Some kind of fragrance.
[7154.22s -> 7156.40s]  Then I want to be able to sit down here and just
[7156.40s -> 7171.23s]  sit, inhale and exhale.
[7171.23s -> 7183.84s]  Let me do this. Carbon monoxide.
[7183.84s -> 7192.80s]  And by the way, I don't
[7192.80s -> 7196.57s]  want a window in here. This is for
[7196.57s -> 7199.20s]  me to come in, sit down
[7199.20s -> 7205.26s]  with some nice lights.
[7205.26s -> 7207.26s]  You're gonna get CO2?
[7207.26s -> 7209.26s]  I'm gonna be, what? I'll put a vent.
[7209.26s -> 7236.25s]  See?
[7236.25s -> 7240.48s]  That's not enough.
[7240.48s -> 7242.48s]  See? I'll be fine. I've got a vent.
[7242.48s -> 7252.72s]  It's not an interrogation room.
[7252.72s -> 7257.64s]  What interrogation room has
[7257.64s -> 7260.01s]  marbled blue
[7260.01s -> 7262.01s]  like pool walls?
[7262.01s -> 7265.28s]  What are you talking about?
[7265.28s -> 7267.28s]  I've never seen an interrogation room
[7267.28s -> 7269.28s]  on any television shows or any movie
[7269.28s -> 7271.28s]  that took place inside of an indoor
[7271.28s -> 7279.92s]  pool facility. All right. Move this.
[7279.92s -> 7292.83s]  Gotta get my towel in the right spot. See?
[7292.83s -> 7298.46s]  We're safe. I don't hate that
[7298.46s -> 7313.16s]  light. There. Are you happy?
[7313.16s -> 7329.98s]  There. Are you happy now?
[7329.98s -> 7331.98s]  No. I am not making
[7331.98s -> 7333.98s]  the SpongeBob kitchen.
[7333.98s -> 7336.60s]  It might look identical
[7336.60s -> 7338.60s]  right now, but I can assure
[7338.60s -> 7340.60s]  you this is not the SpongeBob kitchen.
[7340.60s -> 7342.60s]  But now I feel like it kind of has to be.
[7342.60s -> 7349.71s]  But what about my sanctuary?
[7349.71s -> 7355.72s]  But what about my
[7355.72s -> 7374.35s]  sanctuary? Oh my
[7374.35s -> 7376.35s]  god. Damn it.
[7376.35s -> 7379.42s]  Okay. Fine. Fine.
[7379.42s -> 7381.42s]  I'm making a second room where my
[7381.42s -> 7389.04s]  sanctuary is going. There's like two barrels.
[7389.04s -> 7399.98s]  Where's the door? So the door
[7399.98s -> 7402.80s]  needs to be here, right?
[7402.80s -> 7404.80s]  So let's say the window is here.
[7404.80s -> 7415.28s]  So the door would need to be here. That's
[7415.28s -> 7417.71s]  fine. Let's operate on the door being right
[7417.71s -> 7432.62s]  here. So the door is there. The fridge.
[7432.62s -> 7436.57s]  Where's the wall? No, the
[7436.57s -> 7438.57s]  door would need to be right here, but I can't do it like
[7438.57s -> 7445.16s]  that. Because if this was the window,
[7445.16s -> 7449.58s]  I guess that would make sense.
[7449.58s -> 7453.16s]  Then I need a little table right here.
[7453.16s -> 7465.64s]  It's blue, right? Everything,
[7465.64s -> 7467.64s]  almost everything in this room is blue. Does this
[7467.64s -> 7483.95s]  work? It's white. Put on
[7483.95s -> 7503.47s]  SpongeBob music? Okay, the oven is
[7503.47s -> 7505.47s]  blue. It's like a flat top.
[7505.47s -> 7512.81s]  I wonder if they have them in this game. Oh,
[7512.81s -> 7515.88s]  no. I can make this blue
[7515.88s -> 7520.68s]  though. I think this is close enough.
[7520.68s -> 7531.24s]  Is it a flat top or is it a
[7531.24s -> 7538.16s]  stove, right? Would it be like oven?
[7538.16s -> 7541.74s]  Like grill? Yeah, all they have are these.
[7541.74s -> 7546.20s]  This might do it.
[7546.20s -> 7551.58s]  Not quite. I think
[7551.58s -> 7557.72s]  it's honestly this one. Or one of the ovens.
[7557.72s -> 7564.70s]  I mean, it's this.
[7564.70s -> 7566.70s]  It just needs to be. Okay, we can't make it blue.
[7566.70s -> 7570.09s]  This is perfect. Top is like
[7570.09s -> 7575.28s]  a dark blue. How do I
[7575.28s -> 7577.58s]  do the top? Okay. Top
[7577.58s -> 7585.45s]  is like that. And then it's kind
[7585.45s -> 7596.38s]  of gray. Not that gray. I
[7596.38s -> 7608.35s]  think it's good like this. So where's the fridge?
[7608.35s -> 7610.52s]  Alright, now we need the hole here.
[7610.52s -> 7625.69s]  It's just kind of an open square.
[7625.69s -> 7627.69s]  Oh my god. They actually have
[7627.69s -> 7650.72s]  it. Not enough space on the wall.
[7650.72s -> 7653.47s]  Oh, it has to be exterior.
[7653.47s -> 7665.82s]  Shit. They might all have to be exterior.
[7665.82s -> 7672.28s]  Might be able to get away with it with something else.
[7672.28s -> 7677.85s]  Hold on. I don't know, like opening
[7677.85s -> 7681.05s]  or... It might be something weird.
[7681.05s -> 7683.98s]  Walls. Now it would be
[7683.98s -> 7696.64s]  glass walls?
[7696.64s -> 7706.56s]  Damn it. It has to be exterior. Yeah,
[7706.56s -> 7712.57s]  it's got to be exterior.
[7712.57s -> 7717.18s]  We might be out of luck here.
[7717.18s -> 7733.04s]  Half wall is okay. Just
[7733.04s -> 7739.44s]  do a drive-through episode.
[7739.44s -> 7741.44s]  As long as we don't touch anything, that
[7741.44s -> 7753.28s]  is accurate. So I need
[7753.28s -> 7755.28s]  to put a... Hold on, let me fix this.
[7755.28s -> 7762.76s]  Do half walls. Yeah.
[7762.76s -> 7771.92s]  Squidward would hate this.
[7771.92s -> 7800.57s]  Yes, he would.
[7811.64s -> 7814.52s]  What kind of... It's like a submarine
[7814.52s -> 7824.76s]  door, right? I'll put on SpongeBob
[7824.76s -> 7827.07s]  music. That sounds fun. SpongeBob
[7827.07s -> 7834.28s]  OST. An hour
[7834.28s -> 7847.15s]  of relaxing SpongeBob music.
[7847.15s -> 7859.74s]  Sounds perfect. Alright, the door
[7859.74s -> 7861.74s]  is... It's an open doorway,
[7861.74s -> 7867.23s]  right? Does it close? It's kind of like
[7867.23s -> 7889.56s]  a big arch.
[7889.56s -> 7892.19s]  I mean, if that was a little
[7892.19s -> 7894.43s]  lower tech, it would be perfect.
[7894.43s -> 7910.09s]  This one looks good. Turn the music up.
[7910.09s -> 7926.01s]  There you go. Do the vault door?
[7926.01s -> 7934.12s]  That might be something better. Hold on.
[7934.12s -> 7946.22s]  That actually might be the closest thing.
[7946.22s -> 7949.42s]  Yeah, whatever. Sounds good.
[7949.42s -> 7969.95s]  Maybe we can stick with the blue. Ah, Squidward!
[7969.95s -> 7983.26s]  So where's the fridge?
[7983.26s -> 8009.04s]  We're gonna fix this. Okay,
[8009.04s -> 8030.73s]  I can't hear anything. My building is
[8030.73s -> 8038.60s]  so slow. Your SpongeBob
[8038.60s -> 8040.60s]  impression sounds like Squidward trying
[8040.60s -> 8047.64s]  to do a SpongeBob impression. Thanks
[8047.64s -> 8051.04s]  for the compliment. Alright, we're gonna retile.
[8051.04s -> 8054.56s]  The floor is already done, but it needs to
[8054.56s -> 8068.44s]  be a little bit lighter wood. I like that bubble
[8068.44s -> 8076.06s]  sound. It looks like this one
[8076.06s -> 8106.32s]  here. Other way. Okay.
[8106.32s -> 8110.09s]  Thank God he's making
[8110.09s -> 8113.61s]  the crusty crab. Well, this is just
[8113.61s -> 8129.87s]  one room of the house.
[8129.87s -> 8132.56s]  What were the tiles they called?
[8132.56s -> 8142.09s]  Where were they?
[8142.09s -> 8154.76s]  There. Beautiful.
[8154.76s -> 8174.46s]  This stream is a vibe right now. Yeah.
[8174.46s -> 8178.86s]  I'm glad. I'm just
[8178.86s -> 8182.38s]  chilling out.
[8182.38s -> 8190.51s]  I feel pretty good. Alright.
[8190.51s -> 8192.51s]  So I need my sanctuary row.
[8192.51s -> 8194.51s]  I can't even say that word. Sanctuary.
[8194.51s -> 8199.37s]  Sanctuary.
[8199.37s -> 8201.37s]  Kind of ugly, but I can't fix it.
[8201.37s -> 8211.74s]  Alright. Can I get another picture
[8211.74s -> 8222.11s]  of the room? So the fridge.
[8222.11s -> 8227.80s]  Okay, so there's a door.
[8227.80s -> 8233.88s]  Alright, so if that's where the door is.
[8233.88s -> 8235.88s]  There's another door
[8235.88s -> 8237.88s]  here. Are there two doors?
[8237.88s -> 8240.70s]  There's a gas. There's another range
[8240.70s -> 8242.70s]  right here. There's another gas stove.
[8242.70s -> 8254.60s]  This one is beige.
[8254.60s -> 8268.22s]  It's like beige.
[8268.22s -> 8274.75s]  It's a little too bright.
[8274.75s -> 8290.43s]  So there's the window.
[8290.43s -> 8292.43s]  Okay, the fridge is right here.
[8292.43s -> 8295.18s]  It's one of those double door fridges.
[8295.18s -> 8301.39s]  And it's all blue.
[8301.39s -> 8308.17s]  It's kind of like this.
[8308.17s -> 8318.14s]  What? Two of these. Is it wider?
[8318.14s -> 8328.64s]  I can't make this blue.
[8328.64s -> 8354.20s]  Here we go. Kind of purple.
[8354.20s -> 8363.21s]  Okay.
[8363.21s -> 8365.21s]  And there's a bunch of, there's like a condiments table.
[8365.21s -> 8368.99s]  It almost, it looks like a little
[8368.99s -> 8370.99s]  wardrobe. Like a little bureau.
[8370.99s -> 8386.14s]  Whoa, this is way better.
[8386.14s -> 8414.88s]  This is a thousand times better. The fridge.
[8414.88s -> 8422.04s]  Okay. I need a low,
[8422.04s -> 8424.41s]  like one of these. This might be fine.
[8424.41s -> 8433.29s]  It's probably a lower one. Pretty good.
[8433.29s -> 8454.99s]  I'd like it to be wider.
[8454.99s -> 8468.92s]  Almost there.
[8468.92s -> 8470.92s]  It was lower. It needed to be lower, lower, lower.
[8470.92s -> 8474.81s]  I think that's fine.
[8474.81s -> 8482.49s]  This works. Can't make it blue though.
[8482.49s -> 8499.71s]  And there's condiments all over this.
[8499.71s -> 8513.58s]  Ooh.
[8513.58s -> 8547.68s]  What was that thing?
[8547.68s -> 8573.60s]  You can actually do a koi pond.
[8573.60s -> 8576.22s]  It was a thing that was hanging on the wall.
[8576.22s -> 8580.38s]  And it looks just like this image here.
[8580.38s -> 8582.38s]  It was a bunch of utensils and tools.
[8582.38s -> 8584.38s]  And they just look just like this thing.
[8584.38s -> 8588.48s]  I can't find it.
[8588.48s -> 8597.61s]  Here it is. Where?
[8597.61s -> 8600.11s]  Oh, yep. Here it is. Okay, cool.
[8600.11s -> 8602.11s]  This doesn't match, but it looks good enough.
[8602.11s -> 8628.84s]  Good enough.
[8628.84s -> 8630.84s]  It's kind of coming together. What's in this corner?
[8630.84s -> 8636.73s]  These are all horse tools.
[8636.73s -> 8639.93s]  Yeah, but it looks fine.
[8639.93s -> 8644.86s]  You need the door to Mr.
[8644.86s -> 8652.73s]  Crab's office.
[8652.73s -> 8657.02s]  So this is going to have to be Mr. Crab's office.
[8657.02s -> 8662.27s]  No, I'm not making the whole
[8662.27s -> 8664.64s]  Krusty Krab.
[8664.64s -> 8666.64s]  I'm not making the entire...
[8666.64s -> 8668.64s]  What about my farm church casino?
[8668.64s -> 8675.74s]  I have to make the whole
[8675.74s -> 8681.95s]  Krusty Krab restaurant?
[8681.95s -> 8688.22s]  It would take me two weeks to do that.
[8688.22s -> 8690.22s]  What about my pool?
[8690.22s -> 8701.02s]  Alright, so let me...
[8701.02s -> 8703.26s]  Okay, okay, okay. So this is to the kitchen.
[8703.26s -> 8707.21s]  The other door
[8707.21s -> 8709.71s]  is here.
[8709.71s -> 8711.71s]  It's not though. It's different in every
[8711.71s -> 8714.40s]  episode. I feel like the doors
[8714.40s -> 8716.40s]  in this room are different in every
[8716.40s -> 8730.67s]  other season. Alright, I'll make the whole
[8730.67s -> 8734.70s]  Krusty Krab. Fine. Fine.
[8734.70s -> 8736.88s]  You don't think I will?
[8736.88s -> 8738.88s]  You don't think I'll make the whole entire Krusty Krab?
[8738.88s -> 8741.18s]  Down to the last...
[8741.18s -> 8743.36s]  Down to the last...
[8743.36s -> 8745.36s]  Touch. Down to the last...
[8745.36s -> 8747.36s]  Like buffing out the last scratch.
[8747.36s -> 8770.32s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[8770.32s -> 8773.77s]  Let me at least finish this room. Why is it so
[8773.77s -> 8781.13s]  loud? Okay.
[8781.13s -> 8783.31s]  Door here.
[8783.31s -> 8785.74s]  Door over here.
[8785.74s -> 8788.62s]  So this stuff is actually a little bit more
[8788.62s -> 8791.63s]  to the right. Is the door
[8791.63s -> 8794.12s]  here? Where does this door go?
[8794.12s -> 8804.30s]  So this is Mr. Crab's office
[8804.30s -> 8812.43s]  over here. Is he enough?
[8812.43s -> 8825.10s]  How big is Mr. Crab's office?
[8825.10s -> 8839.69s]  It's pretty small, right?
[8839.69s -> 8844.80s]  Isn't it just a desk?
[8844.80s -> 8855.36s]  There's a desk right there. It kind of is
[8855.36s -> 8859.58s]  this size. Turn the light on.
[8859.58s -> 8866.60s]  Okay. This is a
[8866.60s -> 8868.60s]  load-bearing wall so I can't get rid of it.
[8868.60s -> 8880.89s]  Here's a Krusty Krab map
[8880.89s -> 8887.16s]  you can look at. No, I can't play
[8887.16s -> 8890.11s]  that. I'm just going to look up
[8890.11s -> 8892.11s]  Krusty Krab office.
[8892.11s -> 8899.72s]  Oh, this is a good... Okay, here we go.
[8899.72s -> 8917.63s]  I can do this. So it really
[8917.63s -> 8919.63s]  is just a big desk.
[8919.63s -> 8921.63s]  It's kind of like a big... Is it like a treasure chest?
[8921.63s -> 8928.80s]  Like a suitcase? I think like a
[8928.80s -> 8930.80s]  toy chest will work.
[8930.80s -> 8941.02s]  A toy box. What about just like a box?
[8941.02s -> 8953.74s]  Huh? This dude's 40?
[8953.74s -> 8970.75s]  Not yet. Trunk?
[8970.75s -> 8983.71s]  Oh. Hmm.
[8983.71s -> 8990.04s]  Chest. I'm surprised I don't have one.
[8990.04s -> 9004.11s]  Turn this up. SpongeBob is only
[9004.11s -> 9006.48s]  four adults. I want some water.
[9006.48s -> 9019.07s]  I'll come back and we'll continue.
[9019.07s -> 9207.10s]  I'll be right back. See?
[9207.10s -> 9212.03s]  I'm back. Christmas music?
[9212.03s -> 9219.39s]  Yeah, you should probably change the title to
[9219.39s -> 9221.39s]  Making the Krusty... Yeah, somebody said it. Making the Krusty Krab
[9221.39s -> 9223.39s]  because chat pressured me to do it.
[9223.39s -> 9229.53s]  And then... And then dash?
[9229.53s -> 9233.48s]  I want out. Yeah, there's got to be like
[9233.48s -> 9243.79s]  a dash. I want out.
[9243.79s -> 9258.64s]  Alright, let's go. Well, let me get the stuff that I know.
[9258.64s -> 9261.26s]  I don't think I'll be able to find the exact
[9261.26s -> 9263.26s]  thing, but a wardrobe should
[9263.26s -> 9268.38s]  do it. One of the short,
[9268.38s -> 9272.78s]  wide... They definitely have it.
[9272.78s -> 9279.42s]  Really? It might just
[9279.42s -> 9281.42s]  have to be this big wooden box.
[9281.42s -> 9301.05s]  Okay.
[9301.05s -> 9303.05s]  Now, it's like a big throne, isn't it?
[9303.05s -> 9306.64s]  It's a very large
[9306.64s -> 9308.64s]  chair. Where is it? They definitely have a
[9308.64s -> 9318.30s]  version of it. That's pretty good.
[9318.30s -> 9339.29s]  Oh, and make sure you stay to the end of the stream
[9339.29s -> 9341.60s]  because I'm going to do a full
[9341.60s -> 9344.16s]  all-in SpongeBob SquarePants
[9344.16s -> 9346.78s]  laugh. You're not going to want to miss it.
[9346.78s -> 9366.78s]  Stay tuned. Yeah, that one's fine.
[9366.78s -> 9377.40s]  Gold, right? You can't see it.
[9377.40s -> 9379.64s]  Well, it's going to have to
[9379.64s -> 9386.11s]  do for now. These other two chairs are going to
[9386.11s -> 9396.80s]  have to be these. I saw them earlier. They're
[9396.80s -> 9400.19s]  kind of thicker here.
[9400.19s -> 9402.56s]  Because they're kind of hollowed out
[9402.56s -> 9408.96s]  barrels. I wish I could just go back.
[9408.96s -> 9411.96s]  Can I just go back? I'm missing that button or something.
[9411.96s -> 9437.10s]  There's no window.
[9437.10s -> 9440.49s]  There's another door? Where's the other door go?
[9440.49s -> 9452.01s]  It's wood on the walls.
[9452.01s -> 9460.89s]  We've got to get the aesthetic right.
[9460.89s -> 9462.89s]  Are they horizontal or vertical lines? Looks like they're
[9462.89s -> 9484.64s]  vertical. Kind of like this.
[9484.64s -> 9492.49s]  Yeah, I like that. The lines are vertical.
[9492.49s -> 9498.25s]  I'm looking at a reference image right now.
[9498.25s -> 9505.72s]  Wrong way. Fake fan.
[9505.72s -> 9507.72s]  Oh, this is the door
[9507.72s -> 9510.28s]  that we're seeing here.
[9510.28s -> 9512.28s]  Which means this has to be turned this way.
[9512.28s -> 9514.52s]  Alright, I'll do that in a second. What does that even mean?
[9514.52s -> 9530.59s]  So that back wall is metal.
[9530.59s -> 9548.49s]  Such a fake fan.
[9548.49s -> 9550.49s]  No, I'm sorry guys. I don't remember the
[9550.49s -> 9552.73s]  blueprints of the Krusty
[9552.73s -> 9568.48s]  Krab. Literally L.
[9568.48s -> 9570.48s]  What? Why? I don't know the
[9570.48s -> 9573.04s]  blueprints of the Krusty Krab.
[9573.04s -> 9579.48s]  Now I need a metal.
[9579.48s -> 9594.12s]  Like a steel. Okay.
[9594.12s -> 9597.50s]  Close. You are killing
[9597.50s -> 9599.50s]  my childhood right now. It's not even close.
[9599.50s -> 9612.28s]  I've seen a few things that
[9612.28s -> 9635.88s]  could work.
[9635.88s -> 9637.88s]  I'll try the one I was going to do. It's this one
[9637.88s -> 9643.96s]  down here. Oh shit, it's a double.
[9643.96s -> 9658.81s]  Shit, this is a double too. I don't want a double.
[9658.81s -> 9669.63s]  I need to see what it looks like.
[9669.63s -> 9671.63s]  This is not my final decision here.
[9671.63s -> 9719.04s]  That's better, right? I think that's
[9719.04s -> 9725.37s]  accurate. So this is Mr. Krab's office.
[9725.37s -> 9727.37s]  We can go and mess around with this
[9727.37s -> 9735.16s]  later. Very important.
[9735.16s -> 9737.79s]  How the hell does this
[9737.79s -> 9740.52s]  work?
[9740.52s -> 9744.43s]  Because this comes out to the restaurant.
[9744.43s -> 9747.18s]  And then Squidward's
[9747.18s -> 9749.18s]  station is right here.
[9749.18s -> 9755.69s]  And it's a big boat. I doubt we'll be able
[9755.69s -> 9760.49s]  to do that though.
[9760.49s -> 9766.19s]  It looks like a boat.
[9766.19s -> 9768.88s]  Can you do a Squidward laugh?
[9768.88s -> 9785.26s]  Why are there so many weapons?
[9785.26s -> 9792.68s]  Wait a minute.
[9792.68s -> 9824.52s]  Yeah.
[9824.52s -> 9827.15s]  How am I going to make Squidward's
[9827.15s -> 9834.64s]  cashier station?
[9834.64s -> 9837.64s]  It's a boat. How am I going to make a boat?
[9837.64s -> 9842.32s]  It's going to be some type of
[9842.32s -> 9845.20s]  furniture. Wait, what about a big pet bed?
[9845.20s -> 9849.72s]  That might work.
[9849.72s -> 9872.38s]  Sort of boat-like.
[9872.38s -> 9876.99s]  The race car bed could work.
[9876.99s -> 9882.36s]  Wait a minute. This is pretty damn
[9882.36s -> 9891.20s]  close. I wish I could change the color.
[9891.20s -> 9900.35s]  I wish I could make it bigger. Oh, I could do a bathtub.
[9900.35s -> 9908.22s]  Yeah, that's true. What color is it?
[9908.22s -> 9921.15s]  I need a fixture
[9921.15s -> 9924.54s]  first. Alright, let me get the back wall.
[9924.54s -> 9927.16s]  The back wall is kind of like a blue
[9927.16s -> 9929.90s]  and green and pink
[9929.90s -> 9931.90s]  and it's kind of a lot of different colors, but I don't think
[9931.90s -> 9934.20s]  I can do it. So we're going to have to just do
[9934.20s -> 9936.20s]  the best I can here. Just make it
[9936.20s -> 9941.45s]  kind of industrial. I could
[9941.45s -> 9946.06s]  paint it. Oh, it's a boat.
[9946.06s -> 9962.88s]  I think the bathtub will be fine.
[9962.88s -> 9968.96s]  Should we just use the ones we were using before?
[9968.96s -> 9976.83s]  These kind of work. I think this is actually
[9976.83s -> 9980.48s]  perfect. Alright, let's spend like
[9980.48s -> 9982.48s]  a hundred thousand dollars on this
[9982.48s -> 9984.48s]  because it's going to be almost the entire floor here.
[9984.48s -> 9989.92s]  Alright, before we do anything,
[9989.92s -> 9993.37s]  this is all open.
[9993.37s -> 9997.15s]  And there's a bunch of tables.
[9997.15s -> 10003.10s]  What happened to the farm animals?
[10003.10s -> 10005.98s]  I got bullied into
[10005.98s -> 10007.98s]  making Krusty Krab.
[10007.98s -> 10020.01s]  No, I wanted to make it.
[10020.01s -> 10030.76s]  I'm kidding. That's the nature
[10030.76s -> 10033.45s]  of House Flipper. You go in with a
[10033.45s -> 10035.45s]  design and then you do
[10035.45s -> 10037.45s]  something completely different and you don't
[10037.45s -> 10039.45s]  even start on the thing that you wanted to do.
[10039.45s -> 10046.04s]  I might get halfway
[10046.04s -> 10048.04s]  through the Krusty Krab and this might turn into a different
[10048.04s -> 10060.91s]  place. Alright, so this
[10060.91s -> 10071.32s]  is...
[10071.32s -> 10074.84s]  I'm thinking about pulling this whole
[10074.84s -> 10082.52s]  wall forward, having it be across
[10082.52s -> 10100.00s]  this way. Yeah, the whole thing has to come forward
[10100.00s -> 10109.34s]  because that will give a lot more room for the
[10109.34s -> 10111.64s]  other... Yeah, this place
[10111.64s -> 10135.84s]  can really breathe. Can you upgrade
[10135.84s -> 10137.84s]  swing speed? I can upgrade
[10137.84s -> 10139.84s]  the hammer, which I'll do that now.
[10139.84s -> 10149.16s]  So the hammer's better. Yeah, that's much better.
[10149.16s -> 10155.05s]  Can we get a plankton voice?
[10155.05s -> 10157.05s]  You want me to do plankton?
[10157.05s -> 10159.05s]  SpongeBob?
[10159.05s -> 10161.05s]  I don't know if...
[10161.05s -> 10163.05s]  That was a little deeper maybe.
[10163.05s -> 10184.04s]  Don't crash my
[10184.04s -> 10186.28s]  stream's joke economy right now.
[10186.28s -> 10188.46s]  That wasn't that bad?
[10188.46s -> 10208.88s]  Why was that that bad?
[10208.88s -> 10210.88s]  That was Mitch McConnell's voice?
[10215.61s -> 10217.61s]  SpongeBob?
[10217.61s -> 10229.50s]  You're right. Yep, that's true.
[10229.50s -> 10237.05s]  Pull this forward. I don't need to get into there
[10237.05s -> 10240.38s]  from here. No, I don't. I'll seal it up later.
[10240.38s -> 10260.48s]  You went from 2100
[10260.48s -> 10263.16s]  to 1790 with that one. That's
[10263.16s -> 10265.53s]  not fair. That's not fair.
[10265.53s -> 10272.11s]  That's not fair.
[10272.11s -> 10305.63s]  Why can't I move this? Alright,
[10305.63s -> 10307.63s]  so the door to get in is
[10307.63s -> 10311.45s]  here. No, where
[10311.45s -> 10317.79s]  is it? It's right here. Right there.
[10317.79s -> 10346.12s]  One more.
[10346.12s -> 10349.45s]  Your stock just went down. That's
[10349.45s -> 10358.16s]  fine. Hey, I pay out
[10358.16s -> 10373.96s]  comedy dividends. That means every
[10373.96s -> 10375.96s]  every few months I read you out
[10375.96s -> 10378.46s]  my draft tweets and there are always
[10378.46s -> 10382.49s]  bangers.
[10382.49s -> 10404.38s]  You find me a draft tweet that you didn't like
[10404.38s -> 10406.68s]  and I will
[10406.68s -> 10408.68s]  agree or disagree with you.
[10408.68s -> 10424.88s]  It's really that big? Why is this
[10424.88s -> 10430.96s]  so huge? This is
[10430.96s -> 10450.99s]  massive. Am I
[10450.99s -> 10453.55s]  crazy or something? Why is this still
[10453.55s -> 10455.55s]  not big enough?
[10455.55s -> 10463.68s]  Come on, dude. Really?
[10463.68s -> 10489.28s]  Which is better? This or Papa's freezer
[10489.28s -> 10491.96s]  ria? This is much better. I love
[10491.96s -> 10493.96s]  Papa's freezer ria
[10493.96s -> 10496.64s]  but how slippery is it in my top
[10496.64s -> 10510.27s]  25 games of all time?
[10510.27s -> 10513.92s]  Alright, do a little bit
[10513.92s -> 10519.55s]  more cleaning up. I need a wall.
[10519.55s -> 10521.55s]  Oh, damn it.
[10521.55s -> 10523.55s]  What is it? What is it?
[10523.55s -> 10526.68s]  What is this? What is going on here?
[10526.68s -> 10533.64s]  What is this? What the hell is this?
[10533.64s -> 10558.54s]  What is this weird paneling
[10558.54s -> 10573.32s]  behind this? Okay.
[10573.32s -> 10575.82s]  I can stay there for now.
[10575.82s -> 10582.67s]  Still, okay, that's much better.
[10582.67s -> 10586.70s]  I might want to move this over a little bit.
[10586.70s -> 10594.12s]  It's not quite all the way flush.
[10594.12s -> 10597.44s]  Say my leg. My leg.
[10597.44s -> 10617.21s]  My leg. Ow.
[10617.21s -> 10638.12s]  Did I get the part?
[10638.12s -> 10640.12s]  Now I can bring this wall forward.
[10640.12s -> 10651.12s]  I'd love to pick this up. I can't pick it up
[10651.12s -> 10654.89s]  anymore. That's a problem for like
[10654.89s -> 10657.26s]  this problem next weekend.
[10657.26s -> 10679.02s]  I want, yeah, speed for sure.
[10679.02s -> 10689.95s]  Alright, I just keep making adjustments.
[10689.95s -> 10708.36s]  Okay.
[10708.36s -> 10718.92s]  Go like this. Much better.
[10718.92s -> 10726.84s]  Okay, let's just get
[10726.84s -> 10731.13s]  this over with. Front door of the
[10731.13s -> 10735.16s]  Krusty Krab is
[10735.16s -> 10737.16s]  right in, it's right here.
[10737.16s -> 10741.63s]  Right in the front. The whole
[10741.63s -> 10769.02s]  floor is green.
[10769.02s -> 10771.02s]  I'm not going to read that. You're fucking
[10771.02s -> 10774.67s]  crazy. Why did you write that?
[10774.67s -> 10780.04s]  All the things to write down
[10780.04s -> 10782.04s]  into a chat room and press enter.
[10782.04s -> 10798.62s]  It's just an immediate response.
[10798.62s -> 10801.37s]  Immediate response. You didn't
[10801.37s -> 10804.25s]  even take one second.
[10804.25s -> 10806.25s]  It was like, oh, yeah.
[10806.25s -> 10808.25s]  The floor of the Krusty Krab is green.
[10808.25s -> 10811.13s]  I look over three seconds, not even, you didn't even take
[10811.13s -> 10813.69s]  not even two seconds.
[10813.69s -> 10817.92s]  My shit is green sometimes.
[10817.92s -> 10821.44s]  Alright. Really?
[10821.44s -> 10823.44s]  Okay. Not even a
[10823.44s -> 10827.98s]  second.
[10827.98s -> 10829.98s]  Why would you share that with the glass?
[10829.98s -> 10851.74s]  Does the Krusty Krab have a bathroom?
[10851.74s -> 10861.79s]  Alright, well this has to be sealed off.
[10861.79s -> 10863.79s]  Because I want people to come through
[10863.79s -> 10865.79s]  this, which is the front door.
[10865.79s -> 10868.41s]  This is all glass,
[10868.41s -> 10870.41s]  isn't it? Big glass panels.
[10870.41s -> 10872.78s]  Can I get a
[10872.78s -> 10874.78s]  exterior of the Krusty Krab, please?
[10874.78s -> 10893.40s]  Would it be under door?
[10893.40s -> 10906.97s]  Or like glass, right?
[10906.97s -> 10916.24s]  Do it again. Okay.
[10916.24s -> 10919.18s]  Same thing on the other side. Two big
[10919.18s -> 10934.03s]  glass doors to get in. It might have to be
[10934.03s -> 10968.20s]  these side by side. Why is this so fucked up?
[10968.20s -> 11003.28s]  Is there a double door?
[11003.28s -> 11005.28s]  It has to be at the last double door.
[11005.28s -> 11015.18s]  Oh, right here. That's
[11015.18s -> 11018.38s]  much better. Oh, it's way too big
[11018.38s -> 11025.16s]  though. It's way too big.
[11025.16s -> 11040.51s]  This could work. Jesus.
[11040.51s -> 11053.31s]  Something like this is on the other side over here.
[11053.31s -> 11070.96s]  This is what's over here. Shit.
[11070.96s -> 11084.59s]  The entire front is glass. I don't think
[11084.59s -> 11104.62s]  I can do that though. It's a place
[11104.62s -> 11117.85s]  holder for now. That's gotta be glass.
[11117.85s -> 11131.29s]  That's gotta be glass. Okay. I'm gonna sneeze.
[11131.29s -> 11152.91s]  I actually caught it this time.
[11152.91s -> 11157.84s]  Okay. Now the
[11157.84s -> 11159.84s]  foundation is almost here. Now the work will speed
[11159.84s -> 11161.84s]  up very, very much intensely.
[11161.84s -> 11184.28s]  Here we go. This is a vibe
[11184.28s -> 11188.83s]  tonight. I'm glad. That makes me happy.
[11188.83s -> 11201.12s]  This will start to look more and more like
[11201.12s -> 11203.12s]  your beloved Krusty Krab
[11203.12s -> 11211.93s]  very shortly. This is
[11211.93s -> 11215.45s]  a good street to fall asleep to. Yeah, that's
[11215.45s -> 11219.74s]  cool. I don't mind that.
[11219.74s -> 11239.56s]  Big problem. I
[11239.56s -> 11242.25s]  cannot put anything
[11242.25s -> 11244.25s]  on the top or bottom here.
[11244.25s -> 11246.25s]  This has to be blocked with the bathtub.
[11246.25s -> 11249.52s]  This is actually a pretty major
[11249.52s -> 11259.12s]  problem. Can I do the half wall on
[11259.12s -> 11266.35s]  the ground? I don't know if I
[11266.35s -> 11268.84s]  can do a half wall on the ground.
[11268.84s -> 11281.56s]  I cannot. A window theoretically
[11281.56s -> 11283.56s]  is a great idea, but I
[11283.56s -> 11285.56s]  don't know if there are very many windows that
[11285.56s -> 11287.74s]  can be interior windows.
[11287.74s -> 11297.34s]  I need a fixture though.
[11297.34s -> 11310.78s]  Mountable bathtub. Where's the actual
[11310.78s -> 11313.98s]  bathtub?
[11313.98s -> 11325.42s]  This one here, right? I need the actual
[11325.42s -> 11327.42s]  thing. Where do you buy those?
[11327.42s -> 11333.23s]  Baths and showers.
[11333.23s -> 11338.35s]  Where is it? It's the
[11338.35s -> 11340.35s]  little thing that has to go into the wall.
[11340.35s -> 11360.56s]  Call something else
[11360.56s -> 11366.70s]  installations instead of this.
[11366.70s -> 11371.95s]  Okay, here we go. Yeah. Shower.
[11371.95s -> 11376.68s]  All right. Bathtub. But it's on the wall.
[11376.68s -> 11381.48s]  I need a wall.
[11381.48s -> 11391.90s]  This could hide it. I wonder how well
[11391.90s -> 11414.86s]  this hides it. Let's find out. I think this might
[11414.86s -> 11416.86s]  hide it. Yeah, this one will hide it much better.
[11416.86s -> 11446.92s]  I wonder what the biggest one is. Installation.
[11446.92s -> 11449.29s]  Oh. Where's just like
[11449.29s -> 11451.29s]  bathtub? Bathroom.
[11451.29s -> 11454.17s]  Okay, fixtures. Oh, I wish they would
[11454.17s -> 11456.17s]  I wish I could see how big they were without
[11456.17s -> 11476.40s]  having to buy it first. That's
[11476.40s -> 11479.02s]  pretty good. I don't know
[11479.02s -> 11491.24s]  if I'm going to do better than that. Maybe
[11491.24s -> 11493.87s]  I could. I doubt it though.
[11493.87s -> 11524.00s]  Wait a minute. Guys.
[11524.00s -> 11528.54s]  Guys, I could have just
[11528.54s -> 11530.54s]  made my own fucking
[11530.54s -> 11537.00s]  building. Why have I
[11537.00s -> 11539.00s]  decided to turn this
[11539.00s -> 11541.00s]  residential house
[11541.00s -> 11543.44s]  into the Krusty Krab? I could have just made the
[11543.44s -> 11545.44s]  Krusty Krab from scratch.
[11545.44s -> 11548.12s]  Well, now it's too late.
[11548.12s -> 11551.26s]  But are there any empty
[11551.26s -> 11553.26s]  lots? I didn't see an empty lot.
[11553.26s -> 11569.58s]  I'm going to see this through.
[11569.58s -> 11573.10s]  I think this is going to be good. Trust in
[11573.10s -> 11575.10s]  this process I have here.
[11575.10s -> 11581.31s]  Trust in this process.
[11581.31s -> 11615.53s]  The price is broken. Portal 3?
[11615.53s -> 11618.16s]  Hold
[11618.16s -> 11622.76s]  on. Just wait till the tables get in here.
[11622.76s -> 11627.12s]  Wait till the floor is done.
[11627.12s -> 11629.12s]  Wait till the decorations are up.
[11629.12s -> 11649.72s]  How long has this been playing for? I thought
[11649.72s -> 11662.64s]  this was still Spongebob.
[11662.64s -> 11669.48s]  Leave this on.
[11669.48s -> 11671.48s]  This was pretty good.
[11671.48s -> 11694.00s]  This is nice. We're making progress.
[11694.00s -> 11726.24s]  Here we go. One, when
[11726.24s -> 11728.80s]  the floor is installed, you're
[11728.80s -> 11731.93s]  all going to be...oh my
[11731.93s -> 11737.48s]  god. That's the
[11737.48s -> 11742.60s]  Krusty Krab. Now that's
[11742.60s -> 11764.62s]  the Krusty Krab I know.
[11764.62s -> 11766.62s]  Me doing that accent is like
[11766.62s -> 11772.06s]  Cilantro for a lot of you. You either really liked
[11772.06s -> 11774.06s]  what I just did or you hated it so
[11774.06s -> 11776.06s]  much that you just, you just
[11776.06s -> 11798.51s]  want me to turn my stream off. Alright.
[11798.51s -> 11807.08s]  Floor going in. It is a green
[11807.08s -> 11814.62s]  floor. This looks pretty good.
[11814.62s -> 11824.80s]  Let's try it.
[11824.80s -> 11848.73s]  I need lights in here. It's a green wood.
[11848.73s -> 11858.51s]  I don't know if I can do that. Green
[11858.51s -> 11863.50s]  wood. I don't think so.
[11863.50s -> 11866.36s]  This is close. Tile though.
[11866.36s -> 11881.69s]  Alright. Better. I think that's
[11881.69s -> 11886.04s]  better. It's got some more texture on it.
[11886.04s -> 11895.58s]  Can you change the color of the wood? You can, but you can
[11895.58s -> 11897.58s]  only really change it to other wood
[11897.58s -> 11904.09s]  likes. You can't make it like purple
[11904.09s -> 11926.88s]  or green or...so does this
[11926.88s -> 11929.31s]  door go anywhere in the Krusty Krab?
[11929.31s -> 11933.79s]  No. This is the Krusty Krab right
[11933.79s -> 11935.79s]  here. I'm making my
[11935.79s -> 11940.83s]  sanctuary. No. That's my
[11940.83s -> 11946.78s]  room. Alright. Where are the lights in the Krusty Krab?
[11946.78s -> 11960.97s]  Do they hang from the ceiling?
[11960.97s -> 11966.22s]  Alright. Krusty Krab
[11966.22s -> 11975.24s]  restaurant floor. Yeah.
[11975.24s -> 11980.04s]  This is as close as it's going to be though.
[11980.04s -> 11985.80s]  What do we got for lights? It kind of looks like
[11985.80s -> 11995.40s]  I can't really tell. There's glass
[11995.40s -> 11998.97s]  back here though. I was going to have
[11998.97s -> 12009.08s]  ceiling lights. These are kind of
[12009.08s -> 12022.96s]  interesting. Nice untextured
[12022.96s -> 12024.96s]  source map.
[12024.96s -> 12035.63s]  It looks fine. Where should I even put these?
[12035.63s -> 12041.77s]  There are no lights in the Krusty Krab
[12041.77s -> 12046.00s]  guys. There are no lights.
[12046.00s -> 12064.60s]  Oh! It's a jump
[12064.60s -> 12073.74s]  map. It's not done. Yeah
[12073.74s -> 12075.74s]  it does look like a dev room doesn't it? Because I'm
[12075.74s -> 12077.92s]  currently developing it right
[12077.92s -> 12102.22s]  now. It's not done. I'll do that
[12102.22s -> 12124.49s]  later. Aren't the walls wood in the dining
[12124.49s -> 12128.97s]  area? I don't know.
[12128.97s -> 12132.56s]  No. The glass. There's
[12132.56s -> 12136.97s]  wooden trim down here.
[12136.97s -> 12138.97s]  This is all this metal.
[12138.97s -> 12142.28s]  And then it's glass?
[12142.28s -> 12148.81s]  Glass. So this is a bunch of glass
[12148.81s -> 12151.63s]  glass glass. Glass and wood.
[12151.63s -> 12166.80s]  Why are these lights so high up?
[12166.80s -> 12172.81s]  Okay. I need to do, fix this
[12172.81s -> 12174.81s]  wood here. Ground.
[12174.81s -> 12182.56s]  This one I believe right here.
[12182.56s -> 12200.33s]  It is. What is casting a shadow over
[12200.33s -> 12209.80s]  here?
[12209.80s -> 12222.03s]  This is supposed to be Mr. Krab's
[12222.03s -> 12237.71s]  office.
[12237.71s -> 12239.71s]  Does Mr. Krab have the green on his floor too?
[12239.71s -> 12258.20s]  I'm sorry.
[12258.20s -> 12261.92s]  This looks like
[12261.92s -> 12264.80s]  you know those game makers
[12264.80s -> 12266.80s]  that are on you know
[12266.80s -> 12268.80s]  you can just get it like oh download this
[12268.80s -> 12274.36s]  game making studio.
[12274.36s -> 12276.36s]  This is, you just downloaded
[12276.36s -> 12278.67s]  a game maker studio. But you just opened
[12278.67s -> 12281.80s]  up Unity for the first time. And this
[12281.80s -> 12283.80s]  is what you came up with for the first, and you have no
[12283.80s -> 12288.16s]  experience at all. Zero. And
[12288.16s -> 12291.10s]  and you're twelve.
[12291.10s -> 12301.92s]  Just like oh look at my room that I made.
[12301.92s -> 12304.48s]  Yeah. There's chairs.
[12304.48s -> 12308.81s]  And there's a chair. But hey.
[12308.81s -> 12312.59s]  You gotta start somewhere. And when you first
[12312.59s -> 12314.59s]  make this room and you get really into it
[12314.59s -> 12316.89s]  and you go wow that was actually really cool. That was really
[12316.89s -> 12320.99s]  fun. And you end up making something like this.
[12320.99s -> 12324.96s]  Which is a level up from that.
[12324.96s -> 12328.60s]  And then you end up making a room like this.
[12328.60s -> 12340.75s]  Which isn't done yet. L plus
[12340.75s -> 12346.00s]  ratio plus your twelve. I
[12346.00s -> 12348.00s]  think it looks pretty good. I'm going
[12348.00s -> 12367.13s]  on the fucking lawn.
[12367.13s -> 12371.93s]  You need to hold your applause
[12371.93s -> 12379.93s]  until the end of the stream. We're going to see
[12379.93s -> 12386.84s]  all the before and after pictures.
[12386.84s -> 12400.28s]  Oh nice rain. This has been
[12400.28s -> 12402.28s]  a disastrous one guy.
[12402.28s -> 12407.08s]  I don't think so. No.
[12407.08s -> 12412.33s]  It's not done yet.
[12412.33s -> 12414.33s]  I don't want you looking over my shoulder while I'm doing
[12414.33s -> 12418.04s]  game development. This is not
[12418.04s -> 12420.04s]  even in a technical alpha right now.
[12420.04s -> 12423.69s]  This is in a Unity free
[12423.69s -> 12425.69s]  trial mode right now. This is not
[12425.69s -> 12441.82s]  a technical alpha. So
[12441.82s -> 12443.82s]  I see tables and they look pretty
[12443.82s -> 12449.71s]  cool and I know exactly where I'm putting them.
[12449.71s -> 12451.71s]  They are they have yellow in the middle and red
[12451.71s -> 12453.71s]  on the outside and they are wheels.
[12453.71s -> 12456.33s]  They are boat steering
[12456.33s -> 12460.36s]  wheels. That's not awful.
[12460.36s -> 12476.54s]  Not awful.
[12476.54s -> 12481.72s]  I could say dining table couldn't I? This one's
[12481.72s -> 12488.19s]  pretty good. Look at a picture of the Krusty. I got
[12488.19s -> 12490.19s]  a picture of the Krusty Krab right here. I'm looking at it right
[12490.19s -> 12511.48s]  now. Tables. This place
[12511.48s -> 12513.48s]  looks nothing like the Krusty Krab period.
[12513.48s -> 12516.17s]  Fuck you. Hey
[12516.17s -> 12518.17s]  come on dude.
[12518.17s -> 12520.86s]  I'm trying. I'm trying.
[12520.86s -> 12525.08s]  Oh that's pretty good.
[12525.08s -> 12538.84s]  They have the one kind
[12538.84s -> 12541.08s]  of pole in the middle.
[12541.08s -> 12543.08s]  It's on a stand. I don't think there's
[12543.08s -> 12554.80s]  any of those here though. They're red
[12554.80s -> 12567.40s]  on the outside. Close enough?
[12567.40s -> 12574.68s]  Yeah it's close enough. And
[12574.68s -> 12577.63s]  there is one here. There's
[12577.63s -> 12580.96s]  one here. There's one here.
[12580.96s -> 12582.96s]  There's one here. There's one here.
[12582.96s -> 12599.92s]  And they sit on little
[12599.92s -> 12617.88s]  barrels. Is it too big? They have little
[12617.88s -> 12623.20s]  any mini barrels?
[12623.20s -> 12631.84s]  Maybe a stool will look like it.
[12631.84s -> 12634.59s]  Pretty good if I could make it beige. Pretty good.
[12634.59s -> 12661.39s]  Right here. There we go.
[12661.39s -> 12680.20s]  They all have two or three. I can move all these
[12680.20s -> 12694.60s]  later. Guys, contrary to popular
[12694.60s -> 12698.70s]  belief, the finishings
[12698.70s -> 12704.27s]  is what ties everything together.
[12704.27s -> 12706.27s]  It's all about
[12706.27s -> 12708.27s]  the decorations and the finishings.
[12708.27s -> 12711.13s]  Already right now
[12711.13s -> 12713.13s]  it has already started to look more like
[12713.13s -> 12715.44s]  the Krusty Krab. Just simply by adding
[12715.44s -> 12718.76s]  the tables. We're going to do a bunch of stuff
[12718.76s -> 12729.96s]  here to hide this. Where's
[12729.96s -> 12732.33s]  Mr. Krab's door? It's coming.
[12732.33s -> 12737.58s]  It's going to be over here. It's going to be right
[12737.58s -> 12739.58s]  here. And you don't...
[12739.58s -> 12741.58s]  I'll show you the finishing touches
[12741.58s -> 12754.19s]  in a second. Where are the bathrooms?
[12754.19s -> 12762.92s]  That's a good question. The bathrooms
[12762.92s -> 12766.57s]  are on the right side.
[12766.57s -> 12768.57s]  So the bathrooms
[12768.57s -> 12773.80s]  need to be over here.
[12773.80s -> 12794.22s]  Bathrooms are over here. How do I move this?
[12794.22s -> 12801.58s]  I cannot take down
[12801.58s -> 12803.58s]  these walls, so I'm just going to have to
[12803.58s -> 12807.23s]  improvise a little. We're going to extend this
[12807.23s -> 12814.97s]  a little bit further. The bathroom doesn't
[12814.97s -> 12816.97s]  exist. No, it's not going to work.
[12816.97s -> 12822.35s]  It might work if I do this.
[12822.35s -> 12832.83s]  Can I build
[12832.83s -> 12840.32s]  off of the house? I don't think
[12840.32s -> 12842.32s]  I can build off of the house that
[12842.32s -> 12849.68s]  exists already. Can I?
[12849.68s -> 12854.09s]  I can't. Wait, is that actually
[12854.09s -> 12858.06s]  doing that? Wait, I can
[12858.06s -> 12862.73s]  do that. Alright. That's a big deal. Hold on.
[12862.73s -> 12889.47s]  So, if
[12889.47s -> 12891.47s]  I extend this wall
[12891.47s -> 12894.67s]  out, then I can make the bathrooms
[12894.67s -> 12905.16s]  right here. So that wall here
[12905.16s -> 12907.16s]  has to come out and match the wall over on
[12907.16s -> 12917.92s]  the other side. So if I can extend this
[12917.92s -> 12927.26s]  wall, that would be great. Because
[12927.26s -> 12929.88s]  this is the back. Let's see.
[12929.88s -> 12952.72s]  Yes! Let me
[12952.72s -> 12983.95s]  get rid of all this shit here. I just needed some space.
[12983.95s -> 12987.64s]  Alright. And now
[12987.64s -> 12992.00s]  can I bring this wall out?
[12992.00s -> 12994.00s]  What is this weird, what is this wacky
[12994.00s -> 13038.60s]  wall right here? No!
[13038.60s -> 13040.60s]  I can't get rid of this exterior
[13040.60s -> 13048.03s]  wall. No!
[13048.03s -> 13053.71s]  I can't, really?
[13053.71s -> 13055.71s]  Oh, oh well. Well, this is
[13055.71s -> 13059.98s]  the bathroom. Okay.
[13059.98s -> 13064.33s]  I gotta clean it. Put a door there?
[13064.33s -> 13068.30s]  I don't know if it'll work, though.
[13068.30s -> 13087.18s]  Because this wall can't be manipulated.
[13087.18s -> 13089.61s]  Oh! Oh!
[13089.61s -> 13094.16s]  I actually can. Alright. Where is
[13094.16s -> 13096.16s]  it? It's like right here.
[13096.16s -> 13099.47s]  Hell yeah. Nice!
[13099.47s -> 13104.52s]  It's a little messed up because
[13104.52s -> 13109.13s]  it's alright, though. Bathroom.
[13109.13s -> 13112.52s]  Beautiful. Perfect. Okay.
[13112.52s -> 13115.47s]  Bathroom.
[13115.47s -> 13122.88s]  Get a few images. A bunch of
[13122.88s -> 13137.21s]  wooden stalls, isn't it? Krusty
[13137.21s -> 13147.71s]  Krab bathroom. Okay.
[13147.71s -> 13156.80s]  So it's still green. Honestly,
[13156.80s -> 13158.80s]  the farm update will probably make this a lot easier.
[13158.80s -> 13168.52s]  So it's the same green, same blue.
[13168.52s -> 13203.84s]  Which I didn't delete at all.
[13203.84s -> 13205.84s]  Somebody doing the
[13205.84s -> 13207.84s]  chimpanzee jumping thing.
[13207.84s -> 13218.84s]  SpongeBob music! It kind of looks like
[13218.84s -> 13220.84s]  you guys are dancing to this song.
[13220.84s -> 13222.84s]  So I don't even see the anger in the chimpanzee.
[13222.84s -> 13225.47s]  I just see, I see you guys
[13225.47s -> 13235.20s]  rocking out to this music.
[13235.20s -> 13261.05s]  It's lining up with the music. Okay.
[13261.05s -> 13281.15s]  You just came back after two hours, what'd you miss?
[13281.15s -> 13284.72s]  Um, well, I think
[13284.72s -> 13286.72s]  it was just about an hour or two ago that I decided to make
[13286.72s -> 13298.68s]  this a SpongeBob house. Alright.
[13298.68s -> 13302.59s]  Good, almost done. There aren't
[13302.59s -> 13304.59s]  any more rooms after this, so it's all detail.
[13304.59s -> 13321.23s]  Damn it, it's not enough. It's fine.
[13321.23s -> 13323.23s]  Okay, so now we need the green. The green is easy.
[13323.23s -> 13332.12s]  Was these ones, no?
[13332.12s -> 13334.12s]  It was the... this one looks kind of better.
[13334.12s -> 13336.94s]  Oh, this is wall.
[13336.94s -> 13360.54s]  Damn it. Wait a minute.
[13360.54s -> 13364.06s]  These are way better. Isn't that kind of way better?
[13364.06s -> 13380.19s]  Nice. That's actually
[13380.19s -> 13384.09s]  perfect, yeah. I
[13384.09s -> 13386.33s]  don't know, you shouldn't be able to bump into stuff
[13386.33s -> 13411.10s]  when you're doing this. It's going the wrong
[13411.10s -> 13418.97s]  direction. Shit, it's got to
[13418.97s -> 13421.28s]  go vertical. You're right, damn it.
[13421.28s -> 13448.60s]  There is a vertical one, isn't there? It's actually
[13448.60s -> 13476.38s]  kind of getting there. Why is there got to be grass
[13476.38s -> 13479.39s]  sticking out? Alright, stalls.
[13479.39s -> 13481.39s]  They are made out of wood.
[13481.39s -> 13483.39s]  There are three or four toilets.
[13483.39s -> 13489.60s]  They're mounted into the wall.
[13489.60s -> 13493.12s]  They're the little mounted toilet, and they have
[13493.12s -> 13506.68s]  a life preserver. It's pretty close, but
[13506.68s -> 13512.25s]  it doesn't have the life preserver. That's close enough.
[13512.25s -> 13526.25s]  We're good. Alright, so it's one,
[13526.25s -> 13528.25s]  two, three. So I need three of those
[13528.25s -> 13539.05s]  things. Suspended toilet.
[13539.05s -> 13547.80s]  Alright, so we'll go one, two,
[13547.80s -> 13603.66s]  three. Alright, now I need to make
[13603.66s -> 13607.87s]  wooden stalls.
[13607.87s -> 13611.13s]  Do they make them anyways?
[13611.13s -> 13613.13s]  They do not, but
[13613.13s -> 13615.95s]  the farming update
[13615.95s -> 13619.84s]  gave us the ability
[13619.84s -> 13621.84s]  to make opening
[13621.84s -> 13626.57s]  kind of stall-like doors.
[13626.57s -> 13633.87s]  Greenhouse wooden segment. Oh,
[13633.87s -> 13656.59s]  here we go. This can't be inside.
[13656.59s -> 13669.96s]  Can none of this be?
[13669.96s -> 13698.96s]  So what do I do? Wooden roof side
[13698.96s -> 13702.22s]  segment. Where would the
[13702.22s -> 13704.89s]  I have no idea where they would put them. Like the
[13704.89s -> 13709.24s]  horse stable thing. There we
[13709.24s -> 13741.29s]  go. Yep, this should do it.
[13741.29s -> 13744.94s]  Are you going to play House Flipper 2? Better believe it.
[13744.94s -> 13755.24s]  Let me make these better.
[13755.24s -> 13766.88s]  I can't move these. But they have
[13766.88s -> 13769.82s]  What is hanging? There's like a cloth
[13769.82s -> 13777.18s]  or something. Hold on. So it's the wooden
[13777.18s -> 13779.36s]  doors, and then
[13779.36s -> 13781.36s]  it's two pieces of cloth that hang
[13781.36s -> 13783.36s]  from side to side. So these
[13783.36s -> 13787.26s]  technically would be the doors. I could always
[13787.26s -> 13793.85s]  add more toilets here. What's better?
[13793.85s -> 13795.85s]  House Flipper or Buffalo Chicken Sub? Buffalo
[13795.85s -> 13801.42s]  Chicken Sub all day. I'm sorry. Buffalo
[13801.42s -> 13803.42s]  Chicken Sub takes the place. It's like number
[13803.42s -> 13805.42s]  it's like number six on my
[13805.42s -> 13807.42s]  most favorite games of all time.
[13807.42s -> 13812.16s]  We were talking about like you got like Diablo 2
[13812.16s -> 13814.16s]  Team Fortress 2
[13814.16s -> 13816.16s]  Neverhood
[13816.16s -> 13818.52s]  Buffalo Chicken Sub
[13818.52s -> 13820.52s]  with blue cheese on it
[13820.52s -> 13822.52s]  obviously. And then probably Resident Evil
[13822.52s -> 13824.52s]  4 is probably up there.
[13824.52s -> 13826.52s]  Vampire Survivors is probably there too.
[13826.52s -> 13842.76s]  I need more toilets. Installation.
[13842.76s -> 13877.12s]  Good. Nothing over
[13877.12s -> 13881.34s]  there. That's fine. Blue cheese is so good. Yeah.
[13881.34s -> 13883.52s]  If I could
[13883.52s -> 13885.52s]  not get weird looks, I would
[13885.52s -> 13887.52s]  put blue cheese on almost every single meal.
[13887.52s -> 13903.96s]  Look at how nice and
[13903.96s -> 13905.96s]  colorful. Oh, look. SpongeBob.
[13905.96s -> 13918.57s]  Wow. Why are you not
[13918.57s -> 13921.84s]  at Coachella? I don't think I could name
[13921.84s -> 13923.84s]  you one band that's currently playing
[13923.84s -> 13926.20s]  at Coachella right now. I just don't think I could.
[13926.20s -> 13936.24s]  Okay. I need
[13936.24s -> 13943.15s]  What are they? What do they got? Decorations.
[13943.15s -> 13949.29s]  I need some nautical stuff.
[13949.29s -> 13970.83s]  Hmm. Let's see. There's
[13970.83s -> 13972.83s]  a hand dryer. There's a nautical.
[13972.83s -> 13982.24s]  There's a barrel. Oh, no. I thought I planted
[13982.24s -> 13990.43s]  other stuff. The gorillas are at Coachella
[13990.43s -> 13999.00s]  right now? Are you serious? Oh, shit.
[13999.00s -> 14001.00s]  Okay. Krusty Krab. Let's focus on one room
[14001.00s -> 14006.25s]  at a time, please.
[14006.25s -> 14009.13s]  I just typed in Krusty Krab
[14009.13s -> 14013.36s]  Coachella. Krusty Krab
[14013.36s -> 14028.84s]  restaurant floor. I mean,
[14028.84s -> 14034.48s]  there's not much else in here. There's a menu
[14034.48s -> 14037.29s]  that's up here. There's the door over there.
[14037.29s -> 14040.43s]  Okay. There's the door to
[14040.43s -> 14042.43s]  Mr. Krab's office, which let me go in there.
[14042.43s -> 14062.27s]  I can't even look at this because it's such a placeholder.
[14062.27s -> 14092.09s]  I can't even look at it. How about Minecraft
[14092.09s -> 14103.80s]  Cherry Blossom Forest?
[14103.80s -> 14119.29s]  It needs to be a little bit wider. I gotta
[14119.29s -> 14121.29s]  type this door. What is this? It's called
[14121.29s -> 14123.29s]  like something. Sounds like a C, right?
[14123.29s -> 14127.90s]  So I don't have to scroll down the never-ending
[14127.90s -> 14131.48s]  where is it? What the hell is it called?
[14131.48s -> 14136.22s]  It's called KY.
[14136.22s -> 14162.91s]  Okay. I guess I can only do
[14162.91s -> 14180.12s]  singles. I need a painting.
[14180.12s -> 14188.06s]  Something that looks like a menu.
[14188.06s -> 14221.64s]  Could be a menu. Oh, I can also import
[14221.64s -> 14230.22s]  images. That's true. Okay. Krusty
[14230.22s -> 14234.06s]  Krab
[14234.06s -> 14247.68s]  signs? Krusty Krab
[14247.68s -> 14258.24s]  Krusty Krab menu sign. It's kind of hard
[14258.24s -> 14262.89s]  to get a clean image of this.
[14262.89s -> 14264.89s]  I can get the big thing that's
[14264.89s -> 14268.67s]  outside. We'll do that later.
[14268.67s -> 14272.56s]  We're not done with our
[14272.56s -> 14298.80s]  internals here. Ugly, ugly, ugly,
[14298.80s -> 14301.48s]  ugly. We need these
[14301.48s -> 14303.66s]  glass panels
[14303.66s -> 14322.60s]  all over here. It sits on there weird.
[14322.60s -> 14345.87s]  Okay. Not bad. Not
[14345.87s -> 14354.00s]  bad. I want to put another one here, but
[14354.00s -> 14359.56s]  I don't think I have enough room for it. What happened to the music?
[14359.56s -> 14367.74s]  Oh, I closed the window.
[14367.74s -> 14370.30s]  What should I put on? Terraria? Terraria?
[14370.30s -> 14373.05s]  Okay. We've done that before. We did a little bit of Startup Valley.
[14373.05s -> 14382.57s]  Morrowind? RuneScape?
[14382.57s -> 14389.04s]  Pizza Tower is a little too intense
[14389.04s -> 14397.55s]  right now. Morrowind sounds pretty good.
[14397.55s -> 14415.84s]  There it is.
[14415.84s -> 14417.84s]  The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind.
[14428.54s -> 14430.54s]  I'm kidding. I know everyone's going to freak out.
[14430.54s -> 14446.09s]  So this is just more of the restaurant,
[14446.09s -> 14448.09s]  but this is way too big.
[14448.09s -> 14450.09s]  This is the Krusty Krab. This is how
[14450.09s -> 14455.21s]  big it is. There's no way
[14455.21s -> 14458.09s]  that I...
[14458.09s -> 14461.48s]  Here's my plan.
[14461.48s -> 14463.48s]  I'm getting my fucking zone that I want.
[14463.48s -> 14466.75s]  I'm getting my zone.
[14466.75s -> 14492.72s]  It's going to be a secret entrance.
[14492.72s -> 14496.68s]  I'm making my sanctuary.
[14496.68s -> 14501.61s]  You can go to the Krusty Krab all you want.
[14501.61s -> 14506.54s]  Me. I'll be in this room.
[14506.54s -> 14540.36s]  Crack shed.
[14540.36s -> 14542.36s]  This is the room he goes into to escape us.
[14542.36s -> 14573.85s]  One more piece.
[14573.85s -> 14592.60s]  I want my tub.
[14592.60s -> 14611.28s]  Thank you. I want a different
[14611.28s -> 14627.98s]  trim. Yeah.
[14627.98s -> 14644.48s]  We need a wall.
[14644.48s -> 14655.60s]  Wall tile. I'm clean.
[14655.60s -> 14668.14s]  How about these? I need to see the whole
[14668.14s -> 14677.55s]  thing. It's too bright. Well, we can
[14677.55s -> 14682.22s]  change the lighting. A little too
[14682.22s -> 14691.05s]  much going on. A little too loud.
[14691.05s -> 14701.74s]  Yeah, it's a little too loud.
[14701.74s -> 14707.44s]  This might be pretty good.
[14707.44s -> 14718.70s]  Put it down.
[14718.70s -> 14732.44s]  Pick it up. That is smoky.
[14732.44s -> 14735.07s]  I like it. Look at how smoky
[14735.07s -> 14770.33s]  this is. Can't stand in the pool.
[14770.33s -> 14780.88s]  Nice.
[14780.88s -> 14783.76s]  Just wait till I get the ambient lighting
[14783.76s -> 14785.93s]  in here. You are going to shit your
[14785.93s -> 14822.28s]  pants. This room is kind of freaking me out.
[14822.28s -> 14824.28s]  I don't like it. It's like too much going on.
[14824.28s -> 14827.42s]  I need ambient lighting in here. Quick.
[14827.42s -> 14838.22s]  I need really cool
[14838.22s -> 14840.22s]  ambient lighting in here.
[14840.22s -> 14847.71s]  As soon as humanly possible.
[14847.71s -> 14866.70s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[14866.70s -> 14868.70s]  Dude, that's real subtle. I know.
[14868.70s -> 14874.01s]  I need, hold on. Star Wars?
[14874.01s -> 14898.97s]  I'm not comfortable in here
[14898.97s -> 14905.69s]  yet. This feels like
[14905.69s -> 14907.69s]  a fake
[14907.69s -> 14909.93s]  room for a prank show.
[14909.93s -> 14912.88s]  Oh, yes. Come right this way, Mr.
[14912.88s -> 14914.88s]  Hudson. Come over here. Come to our beautiful spa.
[14914.88s -> 14917.31s]  It's like, oh, okay.
[14917.31s -> 14921.02s]  Someone's going to do something.
[14921.02s -> 14924.73s]  Someone's going to fuck with me here. The walls are going to collapse
[14924.73s -> 14926.73s]  and a bunch of gorillas are going to
[14926.73s -> 14930.83s]  attack me in here.
[14930.83s -> 14937.80s]  This is a prank room. But it's not done yet.
[14937.80s -> 14951.93s]  Let me finish it.
[14951.93s -> 14955.58s]  I need pool lights.
[14955.58s -> 14959.16s]  Do they have pool lights?
[14959.16s -> 14967.93s]  I don't think so. Well, that's going up.
[14967.93s -> 14971.84s]  That's a Krusty Krab thing.
[14971.84s -> 14987.39s]  What color is this? I don't want it too bright.
[14987.39s -> 14991.29s]  This seems pretty relaxing.
[14991.29s -> 15013.12s]  It's too many.
[15013.12s -> 15018.56s]  Well, it says they were small.
[15018.56s -> 15033.13s]  Why is it so bright?
[15033.13s -> 15035.44s]  Put up fairy lights? Do they have them?
[15035.44s -> 15041.07s]  I don't think they have stuff like that.
[15041.07s -> 15061.61s]  Stop putting it away.
[15061.61s -> 15107.74s]  There's no water even in there.
[15107.74s -> 15137.95s]  Neons. I got to get this brick out of here.
[15137.95s -> 15154.91s]  It's pissing me off. I'm going to
[15154.91s -> 15156.91s]  buy like 5,000 of these.
[15156.91s -> 15159.34s]  So I just never have to buy them again.
[15159.34s -> 15161.84s]  I don't care if I store them in a fucking shed in the backyard.
[15161.84s -> 15193.82s]  Jesus.
[15193.82s -> 15195.82s]  If I touch the water,
[15195.82s -> 15197.82s]  everything goes away.
[15197.82s -> 15214.14s]  Hey, could you go this song?
[15214.14s -> 15222.06s]  Let me listen to it again.
[15222.06s -> 15231.66s]  What does it go?
[15243.29s -> 15257.88s]  It's so old.
[15257.88s -> 15260.38s]  That's a very old meme.
[15260.38s -> 15270.94s]  I am not trapped. I'll be okay.
[15270.94s -> 15273.63s]  Because I'm going to make an opening
[15273.63s -> 15276.64s]  over here.
[15276.64s -> 15323.72s]  The door will probably be right here.
[15323.72s -> 15325.72s]  Now, there's a door right here, isn't there?
[15325.72s -> 15329.93s]  Or am I making that up? Isn't there a door right here?
[15329.93s -> 15335.50s]  No, it's not.
[15335.50s -> 15349.56s]  Really? Okay.
[15349.56s -> 15352.06s]  House Slipper 2 comes out this year,
[15352.06s -> 15354.24s]  doesn't it? In like a few months.
[15354.24s -> 15356.67s]  I think that's when it's
[15356.67s -> 15372.41s]  planning on coming out.
[15372.41s -> 15376.38s]  4 to 3? Cool.
[15376.38s -> 15391.68s]  100% we're playing it.
[15391.68s -> 15394.49s]  So now, I've got to fix that.
[15394.49s -> 15397.05s]  I've got to add the green
[15397.05s -> 15399.05s]  here and then the walls.
[15399.05s -> 15401.48s]  So let's buy a shitload of the walls.
[15401.48s -> 15409.80s]  I wish the recently purchased was bigger than this.
[15409.80s -> 15413.32s]  Instead of having to go to
[15413.32s -> 15416.14s]  walls and then all the way down.
[15416.14s -> 15419.71s]  Because I know what I want.
[15419.71s -> 15421.71s]  Or I could just remember how to type it into the search bar.
[15421.71s -> 15424.97s]  Instead of just glazing over
[15424.97s -> 15426.97s]  what it's called every single time.
[15426.97s -> 15438.67s]  You guys like this one?
[15438.67s -> 15450.12s]  Floors.
[15450.12s -> 15453.20s]  It was the green.
[15453.20s -> 15455.50s]  Was it a tile or was it a panel?
[15455.50s -> 15458.06s]  It was pretty far down.
[15458.06s -> 15470.16s]  Crusty Crab.
[15470.16s -> 15477.39s]  Now,
[15477.39s -> 15479.39s]  that's it for the floors of the Crusty Crab.
[15479.39s -> 15481.39s]  We're getting close to being done with this.
[15481.39s -> 15483.39s]  Then I just have to finish the upstairs.
[15483.39s -> 15489.72s]  Do I want any weird lights in here?
[15489.72s -> 15503.40s]  Hmm.
[15503.40s -> 15505.40s]  I don't think I want any lights in here.
[15505.40s -> 15520.32s]  Besides the ones that are already there.
[15520.32s -> 15522.32s]  I'm going to put, uh, this should be it though.
[15522.32s -> 15524.32s]  Yeah. Alright. So I need like
[15524.32s -> 15536.27s]  probably enough.
[15536.27s -> 15538.27s]  Why do I always have to do that?
[15538.27s -> 15540.89s]  Change the roof? Yeah, well, I'll mess around with the
[15540.89s -> 15549.40s]  exterior in a minute. Alright, so the next time
[15549.40s -> 15551.40s]  I play this, which will be at some point
[15551.40s -> 15553.40s]  soon. I'm not, the stream's not over by the way.
[15553.40s -> 15555.40s]  Um, but we will actually
[15555.40s -> 15560.19s]  cows and horses into stuff.
[15560.19s -> 15562.19s]  He got me on this Crusty Crab thing and I'm
[15562.19s -> 15582.97s]  stuck on it.
[15582.97s -> 15584.97s]  Favorite childhood snack. That's a good one.
[15584.97s -> 15589.13s]  Uh, PB Crisps.
[15589.13s -> 15592.44s]  They don't make them anymore.
[15592.44s -> 15594.44s]  I don't know what was in them. I don't know
[15594.44s -> 15597.07s]  why they won't bring them back.
[15597.07s -> 15599.07s]  Those were my favorite snack. Probably ever.
[15599.07s -> 15603.28s]  They're gone forever.
[15603.28s -> 15618.12s]  Actually gone forever.
[15618.12s -> 15620.12s]  Mr. Crab's office is so bad.
[15620.12s -> 15624.86s]  Okay. Can I put wood on the ceiling?
[15624.86s -> 15640.14s]  Let me see.
[15640.14s -> 15642.14s]  As it said, panels, right?
[15642.14s -> 15644.14s]  Floor and ceiling? Floor and ceiling panels.
[15644.14s -> 15653.42s]  I can.
[15653.42s -> 15657.13s]  What kind of, what is it? It's a little darker than this.
[15657.13s -> 15664.73s]  This? Mmm, that's kind of
[15664.73s -> 15666.91s]  alright. Is that good enough?
[15666.91s -> 15689.04s]  I think it's fine.
[15689.04s -> 15693.20s]  Can you play less sad music?
[15693.20s -> 15695.20s]  This is a little somber, isn't it? Okay.
[15695.20s -> 15720.72s]  Um, how about, what's something we can put on?
[15720.72s -> 15723.66s]  Sims buy mode? I like that one.
[15723.66s -> 15748.28s]  Cool.
[15748.28s -> 15751.29s]  Alright. We need to make this area cool looking.
[15751.29s -> 15754.30s]  Relaxing Gran Turismo
[15754.30s -> 15756.30s]  music to help you relax.
[15756.30s -> 15770.94s]  Really? I dig it. I'm into it.
[15770.94s -> 15807.92s]  Let's see if it helps. What's the outside of the Krusty
[15807.92s -> 15817.63s]  Crab look like? Let's see.
[15817.63s -> 15819.63s]  Krusty Crab. It's really good. It's kind of
[15819.63s -> 15822.76s]  green. It's like
[15822.76s -> 15832.30s]  olive. It's kind of like olive
[15832.30s -> 15845.08s]  wood. It's brown?
[15845.08s -> 15851.34s]  This looks kind of green.
[15851.34s -> 15853.34s]  It's wood covered with algae.
[15853.34s -> 15855.34s]  Oh. I mean, it's still green looking.
[15855.34s -> 15868.65s]  Dude, this shit is green.
[15868.65s -> 15870.96s]  This shit is literally green.
[15870.96s -> 15873.26s]  This is not
[15873.26s -> 15875.26s]  brown.
[15875.26s -> 15877.26s]  This is green. This is a green
[15877.26s -> 15890.06s]  tinted brown. Show us.
[15890.06s -> 15903.95s]  Show us.
[15903.95s -> 15906.89s]  All these Krusty Crabs.
[15906.89s -> 15913.93s]  Krusty Crab exterior.
[15913.93s -> 15917.07s]  This shit is green.
[15917.07s -> 15944.52s]  This shit's green. That's green.
[15944.52s -> 15947.72s]  That's brown and green.
[15947.72s -> 15958.59s]  Look at all that green.
[15958.59s -> 15960.59s]  It's wood with moss.
[15960.59s -> 15962.59s]  Yeah, but I mean, it's still like, how am I
[15962.59s -> 15964.59s]  how do I get that to look like that?
[15964.59s -> 15966.76s]  This is going to have to be just brown.
[15966.76s -> 15978.16s]  What is brown? Shit's green.
[15978.16s -> 15983.66s]  I thought my game crashed. I was
[15983.66s -> 15987.31s]  supposed to be really sad.
[15987.31s -> 15989.31s]  That's brown with green on it.
[15989.31s -> 15991.74s]  I don't know why I think that's so funny.
[15991.74s -> 16001.40s]  I'm moving on.
[16001.40s -> 16008.57s]  All right.
[16008.57s -> 16010.57s]  All right.
[16010.57s -> 16022.80s]  All right. Windows jump
[16022.80s -> 16024.80s]  scare. Oh shit. Sorry. I didn't realize it was
[16024.80s -> 16030.75s]  turned up. Well, just do
[16030.75s -> 16034.52s]  this. I
[16034.52s -> 16036.52s]  need it. No, I'm not doing the exterior.
[16036.52s -> 16041.32s]  I do want to pull in that
[16041.32s -> 16043.32s]  sign though. The menu.
[16043.32s -> 16045.82s]  Mod linked it here.
[16045.82s -> 16051.24s]  Galley Grub.
[16051.24s -> 16053.24s]  How do I add this?
[16053.24s -> 16058.67s]  I think I have to pull it in.
[16058.67s -> 16070.25s]  Save this link.
[16070.25s -> 16078.89s]  So much shit on my desktop.
[16078.89s -> 16091.18s]  Windows sound incoming. Let me turn it down.
[16091.18s -> 16100.91s]  So here is what the I'm going to try to get the
[16100.91s -> 16102.91s]  menu into the game. And this is what I'm trying
[16102.91s -> 16108.22s]  to put in here. So then I go.
[16108.22s -> 16113.98s]  I think it's like a camera gallery.
[16113.98s -> 16115.98s]  I got a lot of shit on my desktop.
[16115.98s -> 16134.33s]  So I'm going to do this.
[16134.33s -> 16140.03s]  All right. Let's go. How big should it be?
[16140.03s -> 16157.40s]  Where does it go? I'm right there, right?
[16157.40s -> 16160.99s]  Is it bigger? A little bit bigger.
[16160.99s -> 16179.79s]  Is that too big? That's not bad.
[16179.79s -> 16187.85s]  Can it hang from the ceiling? I don't think
[16187.85s -> 16195.98s]  so, unfortunately. Yeah. And everybody
[16195.98s -> 16197.98s]  was telling me that this was not going to
[16197.98s -> 16199.98s]  even look remotely like the Krusty
[16199.98s -> 16202.73s]  Krab. And we're not even done.
[16202.73s -> 16204.97s]  Finishing touches is all that
[16204.97s -> 16209.26s]  matter. The bathroom is way too big.
[16209.26s -> 16213.61s]  I have to
[16213.61s -> 16215.61s]  do this room. This room is just a placeholder.
[16215.61s -> 16220.60s]  I got to get this a little bit
[16220.60s -> 16225.85s]  nicer looking. Playing with this is to
[16225.85s -> 16230.89s]  go like this.
[16230.89s -> 16243.95s]  All right. One thing at a time. What do I want to add?
[16243.95s -> 16245.95s]  Is there anything down the hallway in the Krusty Krab
[16245.95s -> 16258.62s]  here? It is hanging. Oh, there's an order
[16258.62s -> 16262.97s]  here assigned to. I want to see
[16262.97s -> 16264.97s]  if I can get some nautical stuff here because there's
[16264.97s -> 16274.30s]  let me see. What
[16274.30s -> 16276.80s]  do you like? Anchor? Like a ship
[16276.80s -> 16280.17s]  anchor. Like ship.
[16280.17s -> 16282.17s]  Oh, OK.
[16282.17s -> 16284.73s]  I know I can put one of these
[16284.73s -> 16290.92s]  somewhere. Bingo.
[16290.92s -> 16293.55s]  And where should this go?
[16293.55s -> 16300.72s]  In the office?
[16300.72s -> 16304.68s]  This needs a total complete
[16304.68s -> 16308.97s]  reimagining. I could go to the steam workshop
[16308.97s -> 16311.21s]  too. I could do the steam workshop.
[16311.21s -> 16322.60s]  Nice Gmod office. I
[16322.60s -> 16327.66s]  know. Is a mini safe. All right.
[16327.66s -> 16329.66s]  So is there anything else in this main
[16329.66s -> 16332.28s]  room that is not here that
[16332.28s -> 16347.37s]  needs to be here? The sinks?
[16347.37s -> 16349.37s]  I can't really put glass over here because it won't.
[16349.37s -> 16354.22s]  You need wooden pillars.
[16354.22s -> 16356.22s]  Hmm. Wooden pillars.
[16356.22s -> 16359.34s]  All right. Fix the hole
[16359.34s -> 16364.46s]  where the pillar is. Let me look.
[16364.46s -> 16379.05s]  OK, they I don't think I can put those
[16379.05s -> 16381.05s]  in. They go across the ceiling, right?
[16381.05s -> 16385.85s]  Well, look, there's a couple that are on the ground.
[16385.85s -> 16387.85s]  Looks like to the left and right of the door
[16387.85s -> 16390.54s]  the entrance. If I go like
[16390.54s -> 16394.06s]  this, they're kind of like
[16394.06s -> 16396.30s]  here and here.
[16396.30s -> 16409.29s]  It's got to be
[16409.29s -> 16416.78s]  the same on both sides. It's a little bit tighter.
[16416.78s -> 16419.21s]  It's like here. But for aesthetic reasons
[16419.21s -> 16458.51s]  I'm putting it here. Are you still going to add goats?
[16458.51s -> 16460.68s]  Yeah, I kind of
[16460.68s -> 16462.68s]  threw away the whole farming DLC
[16462.68s -> 16465.18s]  and yeah, that's
[16465.18s -> 16477.08s]  unfortunate. We'll do it again.
[16477.08s -> 16481.24s]  This is just wood, but I don't want to build that yet. All right.
[16481.24s -> 16491.60s]  So this needs to be like here, right
[16491.60s -> 16500.09s]  here. Should be thicker. Really
[16500.09s -> 16534.46s]  sell what it is. It's wood walls.
[16534.46s -> 16540.14s]  These are pretty good. They're kind of
[16540.14s -> 16543.98s]  selling. These are a little dusty.
[16543.98s -> 16561.71s]  Let's try these. Use farm animals
[16561.71s -> 16563.71s]  for customers. That's actually a
[16563.71s -> 16595.96s]  pretty funny idea. This in the corner.
[16595.96s -> 16634.48s]  Pretty good.
[16634.48s -> 16648.36s]  Is it going to sit a little bit tighter in here?
[16648.36s -> 16662.88s]  Together. You missed a spot.
[16662.88s -> 16664.88s]  Doesn't match, but I don't think it really needs to.
[16664.88s -> 16671.98s]  Bathroom is the way it is. This is
[16671.98s -> 16679.53s]  my sanctuary over here. That'll have to
[16679.53s -> 16684.72s]  do. This is the room I want to tackle now.
[16684.72s -> 16689.26s]  The door to Mr. Krabs office
[16689.26s -> 16696.14s]  is left or right?
[16696.14s -> 16698.14s]  Is it closer to the wall or is it more in the middle?
[16698.14s -> 16713.68s]  It's the one in the middle, right? Yeah. Build this up.
[16713.68s -> 16728.76s]  What about the barrels? We'll do some touch up.
[16728.76s -> 16736.70s]  And the door. I'm going to have to keep using
[16736.70s -> 16738.70s]  these weird sci-fi doors, unfortunately.
[16738.70s -> 16779.07s]  Hmm. These look quiet.
[16779.07s -> 16798.51s]  Oops.
[16798.51s -> 16800.51s]  I like it. It's cool.
[16800.51s -> 16804.22s]  Here's the fridge. But we keep that closed
[16804.22s -> 16806.83s]  because I don't want anyone to see.
[16806.83s -> 16810.48s]  Oh, we've got more logos. Hold on. I've got to put these
[16810.48s -> 16834.08s]  in. Okay.
[16834.08s -> 16855.95s]  It's one too. Okay.
[16855.95s -> 16858.95s]  You can't see anything?
[16858.95s -> 16860.95s]  Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.
[16860.95s -> 16863.89s]  Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.
[16863.89s -> 16874.28s]  Yip. Yip.
[16874.28s -> 16879.08s]  I might as well. Oh, there's a raid!
[16879.08s -> 16881.08s]  Oh my god, I got to turn this rain back on.
[16881.08s -> 16883.08s]  But I don't want you guys to see this yet. Hold on.
[16883.08s -> 16885.08s]  I don't want you to see this. This is very important.
[16885.08s -> 16891.99s]  This is where my sanctuary is.
[16891.99s -> 16895.15s]  I'm okay if you see it just didn't want you to see this because it's a surprise
[16895.83s -> 16905.21s]  Hello, welcome. Welcome vine sauce viewers. Thanks a lot, Vinny. Welcome
[16906.27s -> 16912.82s]  This is a surprise for chat. So I'm sorry. I took a little bit longer playing house flipper. Thanks for the raid. Welcome
[16912.84s -> 16915.94s]  We are currently
[16915.94s -> 16921.44s]  Doing something very important. We are recreating one to one
[16921.76s -> 16932.57s]  Not a single detail missed of the Krusty Krab and house flipper doing my best. I think it's going pretty good so far
[16933.13s -> 16941.62s]  We're working on it. And then I've also of course besides the Krusty Krab. I also have my sanctuary over here
[16941.90s -> 16972.50s]  Which has been recently updated. I'm leaving this house. Please. Don't mind the poop chairs. They're temporary
[16974.30s -> 16985.74s]  Alright, hold on. I got some other things to put in here. This is much smaller. All right. Yeah, like right there
[16986.26s -> 17005.71s]  How am I gonna do this? I don't think that works. Can I put it on a tree?
[17016.61s -> 17019.29s]  Why do I feel like I'm walking through?
[17019.85s -> 17021.85s]  One of those like Disney
[17022.05s -> 17029.57s]  Experiences where it's the Krusty Krab. Oh, whoa, I can actually walk around the Krusty Krab. This is so cool
[17029.57s -> 17036.34s]  And then it's just a store in here. This is a huge gift shop with tons of toys and
[17037.93s -> 17039.73s]  plushes and
[17039.73s -> 17045.97s]  Stickers and and you can eat here. You can sit here and eat here
[17046.49s -> 17054.39s]  but hey, but those of you that just joined us and some of you that have been here or
[17054.39s -> 17061.46s]  Some of you that have been here for a while have not seen all of it. So of course, this is we're not done
[17061.98s -> 17064.15s]  This is obviously
[17064.97s -> 17069.47s]  Spongebob's office Spongebob's work area. He's the cook. We got the window here meet a little bit of cleaning up here
[17069.89s -> 17073.81s]  There's a lot to do here. But wait till you see mr. Krabs office
[17074.25s -> 17079.75s]  I'm telling you right now. You are about to be floored with how accurate this is
[17080.29s -> 17092.58s]  But here's the bathroom though a little bit of extra space
[17093.22s -> 17107.41s]  All the toilets work dude, the floor is really carrying it really is without this floor. It was awful
[17107.91s -> 17115.60s]  All right. I'm happy with this so far. I think this isn't going pretty well
[17116.12s -> 17130.10s]  Let's tackle this room because this I just I don't I don't love it. I don't love it. Okay
[17130.42s -> 17145.25s]  What was Vinnie playing tonight? What's Vinnie doing 90s stuff? Oh
[17148.86s -> 17150.86s]  Obscure 90s websites. Ooh
[17151.22s -> 17154.03s]  Sounds pretty good. Okay
[17154.55s -> 17156.55s]  We need a shelf over here
[17157.65s -> 17162.05s]  There's another grill that's there's a second grill right old virtual world
[17162.65s -> 17206.73s]  There's another oven right here. It's too big. It's too big. I can't put it anywhere
[17206.73s -> 17233.29s]  I would pay thirty five thousand dollars for that. I wouldn't so I need an oven or a stove
[17233.45s -> 17238.14s]  There's a second one. What color is it? It's like, um, there's a couple of barrels
[17238.34s -> 17241.87s]  Let me put the barrels in first because I think those those go against back wall
[17244.78s -> 17263.61s]  Yeah, these go like here this I think it's too good how the ceiling needs to be wood
[17264.29s -> 17267.49s]  Shit. All right. Well, I gotta do that right now
[17268.09s -> 17274.75s]  Don't forget the Krabby Patty poster
[17275.81s -> 17300.23s]  Can I get it? Can a mod link me the Krabby Patty poster? You know, the craziest part about this house is
[17300.71s -> 17310.16s]  There's an entire upstairs that has bedrooms and bathrooms in it and it's sealed off forever
[17311.18s -> 17323.93s]  Never to be opened. I think that's pretty clear
[17324.45s -> 17326.45s]  All right, I need to fix the walls over there
[17326.97s -> 17345.07s]  Plenty of these good make sure you add a secret ladder to the upstairs crack addict
[17345.15s -> 17353.48s]  Yeah, I'm gonna hide that though because I don't want anybody to see it. So I'm gonna hide it like over here
[17353.72s -> 17362.83s]  I'm not even sure I can get upstairs ever again. I'm serious. I don't think I can get up there
[17363.39s -> 17380.54s]  What where am I?
[17380.54s -> 17400.69s]  What the hell? Uh, oh cool. You can change the roof, huh?
[17406.38s -> 17412.54s]  Wait, I didn't process that at all. How do I get to the roof tool? Oh
[17425.28s -> 17454.63s]  Cool. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's the what's the top of the Krusty Krab? What? Yeah, no one's gonna look at the roof
[17454.63s -> 17457.35s]  All right. Well, this isn't the wrong spot. So where am I gonna put this?
[17457.35s -> 17466.46s]  I mean that can stay but so I need to it's gonna be like away from my sanctuary
[17466.46s -> 17509.01s]  Right, that makes sense. The hell is the rest of the house put it above the pool
[17509.01s -> 17519.88s]  Yeah, I was just trying to but I don't think I can get up there. It doesn't like that. The pool is there
[17535.73s -> 17544.33s]  The bathtub up there I think it has to just be maybe wait, okay, wait, wait, wait, maybe in the corner
[17544.33s -> 17580.12s]  I can do it right. Okay, I can do it right here. I want this be hidden though. All right
[17580.12s -> 17603.77s]  What is did I do it again? I don't care. Nice. Grab your fatty only at the Krusty Krab. Oh, I'll take that one
[17603.79s -> 17612.09s]  Wait a minute. What is that? I'm taking this downstairs
[17612.29s -> 17635.24s]  What a mirror be better here a mirror on this side and a mirror on that side. That would be kind of fine, right?
[17635.28s -> 17654.71s]  That might be actually pretty good. All right. There are some boxes in here. I got the food over there
[17654.71s -> 17674.61s]  I got the two barrels. There is a window. I actually think this is pretty good so far. Oh, wait, hold on
[17674.61s -> 17680.23s]  Yep. All right, Krusty Krab only a crab fatty only the Krusty Krab. All right. Come on. I don't want to spoil
[17680.31s -> 17718.64s]  Okay, any more any more I should put in I think that'll do it. Yeah, that should be fine
[17718.72s -> 17762.07s]  That should tie the whole room together now. You can look it's not that big. It's a little smaller. Yes, not bad
[17762.07s -> 17781.48s]  This is kind of ugly, but the vampire picture of you behind. No, this is it. That's for my sanctuary
[17781.48s -> 17787.43s]  I need some lights in here that I need a nice light and I'll be happy
[17787.81s -> 17824.43s]  Something very basic. Yep mood lighting exactly string light. I think they do unfortunately. It's okay. We like the chandelier. Ah
[17830.10s -> 17839.50s]  Hey, I hate this picture. It's so stupid. It's too well lit for that photo to be in here
[17839.66s -> 17868.55s]  What about like candles candles make more sense? Oh, I'm gonna make I'm gonna make a blood-borne room
[17868.55s -> 17901.37s]  I'm gonna make a dark souls. I'm gonna pick a from software room pretty good
[17901.39s -> 17916.14s]  I'll put a bonfire in the middle now. I'm sorry. There's not enough candles in this room
[17916.18s -> 17950.48s]  Okay, now it's officially a from software room
[17959.57s -> 17961.57s]  Is this your grave?
[17961.73s -> 17968.96s]  Vampire German grave, how did it get darker? How did I get darker?
[17973.75s -> 17982.00s]  This shit's on your walls. Wait, is there like a coffin? Hold on. Is there like a vampire coffin?
[17982.00s -> 17986.22s]  Why would there be what I'm looking? Oh my goodness. There is
[18005.66s -> 18007.66s]  the crusty crab
[18011.60s -> 18056.30s]  I think the candles are going out. I think that's the problem. He's be bigger than this. I think that's a good size
[18064.00s -> 18091.43s]  Fucked up. Yeah, he wanted to be he wanted to be put into a casket in his sanctuary room. He's not in there
[18091.59s -> 18113.50s]  He just really liked this place. He's in there don't open that open have it have the casket open
[18113.50s -> 18123.67s]  I don't think I can I love it. All right, I need a door there or should there not even be a door
[18123.99s -> 18125.99s]  Just just waltz into this
[18133.68s -> 18138.71s]  Okay. Um, I need like a shitty door. It's like a rickety door
[18138.87s -> 18163.44s]  This might be nice to get the shit out of somebody too. It's an outhouse. Yeah, please wash your oh, hold on
[18163.44s -> 18183.85s]  I got another image. This is a good one. This is a weird question
[18183.85s -> 18188.45s]  Does anybody have any more vampire pictures of me? Like that's a weird question to ask
[18188.89s -> 18215.76s]  Okay, hold on. Do you want safe? All right. Okay. Look at this ready
[18218.85s -> 18241.25s]  Yeah, turn the stream off dude, but we're probably getting close once we start doing shit like this
[18246.47s -> 18250.15s]  God all right that one hat that's going it. I don't this this is
[18250.71s -> 18255.96s]  Why would why do you have this? Why do you have this already? Like why do you own this?
[18255.96s -> 18258.08s]  I don't know. I can't understand why you would own this image
[18258.44s -> 18274.37s]  The question is does is this what goes on top of the door or is this go in the room, too?
[18274.69s -> 18297.12s]  I'll let you see in a second. Is this this is like an advertisement for like who's in here
[18297.12s -> 18312.95s]  I want to put like a big floodlight on that. Oh, jeez. Hold on
[18312.95s -> 18316.35s]  All right. Let me add one more and this is not turning into the saw house again
[18316.35s -> 18322.89s]  But like this is just too much. How is this? I can't believe this is a real person's face
[18322.89s -> 18338.03s]  I honestly don't understand. This is a real human being no spoilers
[18348.36s -> 18357.56s]  You know, honestly though, I'll be honest I've come to terms over the years with
[18358.24s -> 18364.70s]  Just how truly fucking strange my face can look sometimes and it's I just it's funny
[18364.70s -> 18396.50s]  I don't even care. The question is where does this one go that it's not even if it's not even me. Yeah
[18399.39s -> 18404.67s]  Alright, I think I'm done. I think I'm done. I think we've gone. We've gone a little bit too far
[18404.67s -> 18410.37s]  Uh, I think I'm done and that was really I don't know. I wanted I want the before-and-after pictures
[18410.37s -> 18427.72s]  Oh shit, I forgot about this. Hold on. I want the before-and-after photos. We'll make sure to move your office here
[18430.24s -> 18435.87s]  Do one final tour. Okay, welcome and we maybe we're not done

[18454.18s -> 18487.16s]  It's I can't do it. Should these be in the room here? I didn't like that at all
[18487.16s -> 18504.89s]  I find me somebody that did what about the animal customers? Alright, let's get some animal customers in here
[18519.16s -> 18537.84s]  Where are they? Where are they?
[18537.84s -> 18542.00s]  Arming well, how did I find it before? Oh, wait, wait, wait. I think it's actually from a different menu
[18542.00s -> 18553.33s]  I think I have to do it from the laptop. Yeah. All right. I gotta move my office
[18553.33s -> 18560.30s]  Let me save this and we're gonna go back to my office. So back to the office save the progress
[18560.38s -> 18578.01s]  Could I've done from that menu? Oh shit. I thought I had to use I thought I had to pick up the laptop and move it
[18578.01s -> 18602.42s]  There so could I have actually just gone there? Oh shit. I own this the option was immediately beneath what you clicked
[18602.42s -> 18633.33s]  Yeah, but when you have tunnel vision like I do sometimes it's burning. All right. Well, let's see how that's going
[18633.33s -> 18648.91s]  Mr. Grabs room in development by the way, so we just have
[18649.43s -> 18732.00s]  Animal customers. I just want to see what I'm just curious. Okay. I don't even know if I can do this. What?
[18733.08s -> 18774.24s]  Why can't I move? Oh, look at the little pig you guys want to see? All right, follow me. Take a look at this place
[18774.36s -> 18836.96s]  All right. I'm ready. Here's a carrot. No, these are spongebob characters. That's Squidward. Oh, wait, hold on. What about the pig?
[18837.04s -> 18866.34s]  This is cute. I like this. What's wrong? Are you okay? Are you good?
[18866.38s -> 18883.58s]  Doesn't need anything and there are other there's other animals out here. Oh, hi. Hello. What is that?
[18883.58s -> 18898.27s]  What what animals making that sound by the way? No one's gonna eat here
[18903.15s -> 18905.15s]  You okay?
[18905.39s -> 18918.46s]  Be in this room the health department is gonna be pissed. Oh, can I put like feeding troughs in here?
[18918.62s -> 18933.20s]  Don't go in the vampire room though. It's not safe in there. Okay, I need
[18935.02s -> 18944.22s]  Where do I buy food? Oh, no animal care. It's right here. Okay
[18944.38s -> 18949.98s]  Okay
[18949.98s -> 18956.33s]  Imagine going to a place to like a restaurant and there was just like cow and pig feeding troughs inside
[18957.17s -> 18971.57s]  It's a salad bar. Yeah, that's true. I need water
[18973.90s -> 19010.94s]  Hmm. Oh, okay. They're eating. Okay. They're eating. They're eating. You just ate the whole thing. What? Oh, no, the secret formula
[19011.42s -> 19038.06s]  It's pig slough. Oh, wait, the big ones coming in. I only need some water like a watering thing
[19038.14s -> 19068.90s]  Here we go. All right, things are going good. Why are they farm animals in this? I'm so lost
[19068.90s -> 19075.99s]  Um, this is a new update and we're just literally playing it for the first time right now not the last like five and a half hours
[19085.88s -> 19115.09s]  What is that animal? Is it you I'll pack is really do just look like spore characters. Is it good? Oh you eat grass
[19115.09s -> 19140.20s]  Oh
[19140.20s -> 19150.30s]  Where'd it go? Okay. All right, that's it
[19150.30s -> 19163.56s]  I could get some more animals, but I don't think I I think I'm gonna call it you get a bunch of spiders
[19163.56s -> 19193.66s]  Oh my god, I can sleep here you
[19202.40s -> 19203.72s]  the way
[19203.72s -> 19218.92s]  Okay. Well, um, how do I get the before-and-after photos?
[19218.92s -> 19226.30s]  I think I have to sell the house, but I don't know if I want to sell this one
[19226.30s -> 19253.30s]  This one's too special to me. All right, follow me, please and you buy a duplicate. Um, you actually might be able to
[19253.82s -> 19274.52s]  Alright, it is my office now. Oh my god. There's a move button. Alright, I think that's it. That was a lot of fun
[19274.60s -> 19277.92s]  I'll probably play this again, but we'll actually make a farm next time
[19278.42s -> 19292.10s]  And not crusty crab just gonna hang out and play for a little while make the chum bucket next
[19299.65s -> 19312.19s]  Now thanks for hanging out I'll give one final tour those that didn't get to see every room we're gonna start
[19313.19s -> 19324.14s]  All right. It's time. How do I move move? What? Oh, this is not right
[19326.78s -> 19362.13s]  Something's not right. What are the horse? Where's the horse? Huh? Where's my horse upstairs? Maybe. All right, let's do the tour
[19362.41s -> 19366.82s]  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. I have we make our own fresh ingredients here
[19369.70s -> 19374.10s]  Apparently we don't because there's nothing's been planted in months. I guess but never mind
[19374.62s -> 19385.20s]  Here's the front door. I got a nice glass over here a nice. Well, there was supposed to be glass over there
[19385.74s -> 19401.62s]  Yeah, I don't don't mind the pigs and the cows and the animals and stuff. They're just hanging out. You can come in
[19402.14s -> 19404.66s]  Alright, so here's the Krusty Krab
[19404.66s -> 19407.15s]  Pretty good. I added some
[19407.67s -> 19414.74s]  Extra stuff and take it right here. See please wash your fins
[19419.06s -> 19423.31s]  bathroom
[19423.31s -> 19428.84s]  This is a secret exit which goes to the roof just in case you need to use it
[19429.20s -> 19442.32s]  He's the bathroom. There are no sinks in the bathroom. That's unfortunate. I'll fix that next time
[19442.92s -> 19460.78s]  Here is spongebob's room a shot-for-shot remake and put some stuff here in there. This is mr. Krabs office
[19461.18s -> 19475.30s]  The work in progress. Oh and of course the the vampire room
[19476.02s -> 19478.38s]  Or the from software room, whatever one you want to call it
[19479.10s -> 19524.62s]  Beautiful square pool pretty nice. What was that? That's shit. What is that animal? I swear
[19524.90s -> 19535.94s]  Okay, so there's that and then there's the upstairs which is the living quarters. Very cool
[19536.34s -> 19542.68s]  This still needs to be moved into I'm thinking of a big flat-screen television right here
[19543.12s -> 19548.66s]  Nice bath, maybe a little maybe upgrade the bath a little
[19549.18s -> 19554.49s]  Could be a little
[19554.73s -> 19584.46s]  Yoga studio, but you're very well behaved. You're very nice. You want some dress the horse
[19584.46s -> 19596.92s]  I don't know where the horse is horse is fine
[19597.72s -> 19627.69s]  Horse is not fine. Oh, no, you're good. All right, everybody's doing good. I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna call it
[19628.91s -> 19631.34s]  so I mentioned that I
[19631.38s -> 19639.36s]  Was probably gonna take a little bit of a break but not really
[19640.93s -> 19647.54s]  Wednesday this coming week stir and I are gonna play some games but besides Wednesday, I don't really have a plan
[19648.02s -> 19657.73s]  So Wednesday, we're gonna play hanging out stir and I and then maybe another stream later this coming week
[19658.21s -> 19660.94s]  but I
[19660.94s -> 19663.18s]  Only and I are gonna take a little bit of a break
[19663.38s -> 19669.48s]  Been doing a lot of grotto be stuff and we're
[19670.04s -> 19672.72s]  Incredibly happy that a lot of people have been getting their stuff
[19672.72s -> 19683.29s]  But a lot of work to do still up until I want to say a day or two ago
[19683.45s -> 19687.07s]  That's really kind of where I was for four or five straight days of off stream
[19687.59s -> 19696.23s]  When all the grotto be stuff, but I think I think we need to take a little bit of time together
[19696.87s -> 19708.72s]  But I'll see you Wednesday after Wednesday, maybe this weekend. It scares me every it actually scares me every time
[19709.06s -> 19716.96s]  But break as in there's only gonna be like one or two streams over the next week or so
[19717.44s -> 19727.22s]  Yeah, thanks for watching. This was fun. Pretty great update. I'm glad you can actually finally build a house
[19730.34s -> 19733.26s]  Adding additions to houses was always something I begged for
[19734.18s -> 19739.53s]  Five years ago, but you can finally build a house from the bottom up
[19740.01s -> 19746.85s]  But that's a huge deal. Can you please pet the baby pig? Yes
[19747.37s -> 19753.05s]  Come here find truffles
[19753.49s -> 19788.49s]  Did you find one? It's kind of looks like Otto with no hair. Have a tomato
[19796.76s -> 19807.32s]  You don't have to find any truffles. You can just relax. I love I can why you want to go in there so bad
[19807.58s -> 19822.01s]  What if what's in there? What are the wait aren't the ingredients to a Krabby Patty?
[19822.17s -> 19843.22s]  It's not meat right then it's something else. This is just fish crab. That's crab meat. It's a secret
[19843.22s -> 19856.06s]  Oh, it's human meat. It's veggie meat. I don't think anybody knows. All right. I'll see you guys on Wednesday
[19856.10s -> 19862.79s]  I'm gonna I'll hit up stir and see um exactly what we want to do
[19863.19s -> 19866.03s]  He mentioned he wanted to play orks must die free
[19866.47s -> 19874.92s]  So it might be a gamer stream on Wednesday. We also need to watch him play five nights at Freddy's
[19877.52s -> 19886.24s]  Imagining that will probably be part of that stream too. We'll see
[19891.66s -> 19894.20s]  This music was actually pretty relaxing. It was this is Gran Turismo
[19894.98s -> 19902.16s]  Gran Turismo
[19902.16s -> 19906.20s]  Okay, wait, let me make sure I save this
[19910.08s -> 19927.69s]  Yeah, it's safe. All right, and the music I did not forget the music
[19941.39s -> 19942.87s]  There it is
[19942.87s -> 19957.32s]  Yeah, also by the way, just to remind everybody one more time the limited items are about to leave the store in
[19960.67s -> 19968.07s]  15 20 minutes for grotto beasts. Yeah in about 10 minutes 10 20 at 11 59
[19968.07s -> 19976.15s]  The limited stuff is going off the store specific. That is the glow-in-the-dark
[19976.87s -> 19978.11s]  apparel
[19978.11s -> 19981.63s]  That's the original 40 grotto beasts and all the posters
[19982.23s -> 19983.51s]  jiggleberry
[19983.51s -> 19992.36s]  thoraxos and glue man those are all going off and I think the hats are going off too
[19992.36s -> 19996.96s]  the cards are still there though and we uh
[19997.72s -> 20005.86s]  For those of you that are still waiting for shipping updates, we are working on that right now for those of you that don't know
[20007.02s -> 20013.25s]  some of the early orders had some kind of issue a ton of orders have already gone out a
[20014.81s -> 20019.25s]  Massive amount of orders have been shipped and people have got it and we've seen a lot of really cool
[20020.01s -> 20022.89s]  Openings and unboxings and we're just really happy that people like it
[20023.05s -> 20028.19s]  But we want to make sure that the people that are still waiting for a shipping update
[20028.65s -> 20033.05s]  That they actually get as of tomorrow morning. We're meeting with represent
[20033.17s -> 20038.68s]  So we're gonna be talking about it trying to figure out a game plan, but it looks like it looks like they're gonna be
[20040.00s -> 20044.60s]  Starting to really go back and take a look at all those so we're working on it
[20044.60s -> 20048.00s]  We are those of you that are still waiting
[20048.00s -> 20055.78s]  The regular grotto be shirts are still up and they are staying there
[20056.04s -> 20061.62s]  Yes, like the logo shirt logo hoodie and obviously the cards
[20061.88s -> 20067.64s]  Yeah, the starter kit and the cards are all gonna be there
[20067.68s -> 20072.10s]  I will tell you the starter kits are not going to see a reprint
[20072.30s -> 20082.58s]  The plan is not to do a second print of the starter kit and it's still inventory
[20083.02s -> 20092.31s]  But that's something that is not going to see a reprint and we likely depending on how it all goes
[20092.75s -> 20095.43s]  We did a second print of the boosters already
[20095.99s -> 20100.24s]  So we'll see how that goes. We'll see how much inventory we have and
[20100.96s -> 20107.93s]  Make some decisions as that goes forward. Yeah, just want to give you some updates
[20108.53s -> 20113.93s]  What about a second edition?
[20113.93s -> 20123.52s]  What about the uncrusty grotto beast ad? Yep. I would expect that in the next few days
[20123.90s -> 20132.03s]  Yeah, just know that if you are still waiting if you had a March estimated ship
[20133.88s -> 20135.88s]  We are actively actively working on it
[20136.16s -> 20140.54s]  And thankfully it's it doesn't seem like it's a very large amount of people
[20140.90s -> 20144.94s]  But it's still even if it's a smaller percentage of all the orders or whatever it is
[20145.50s -> 20150.60s]  Wait, I don't we don't want that right? So we're trying to actively figure out how to fix it
[20151.24s -> 20169.46s]  Yes, the non glow-in-the-dark stuff is staying but the art prints are about to go away. Yes, Holly
[20169.46s -> 20172.21s]  Do I have that right? Is the non glow-in-the-dark?
[20172.61s -> 20185.28s]  What are you staying or both of those going? Okay, so it the non glow-in-the-dark is staying
[20185.40s -> 20187.32s]  so the one with the
[20187.32s -> 20194.79s]  With the ghost on it. Yeah regular ink is staying logo staying and the cards everything else is going
[20194.79s -> 20209.76s]  Is the glow-in-the-dark gonna be gone forever? We don't have a plan to bring it back, but I don't know
[20210.08s -> 20215.91s]  I don't we're just trying to get through this first period to make sure everybody gets their cards. Everybody's happy
[20216.21s -> 20235.86s]  That's priority number one right now. And with that we'll see you Wednesday
[20236.26s -> 20240.64s]  We probably won't bring it back because with the as limited as some of the stuff is
[20241.52s -> 20245.92s]  the cards we have inventory and
[20246.68s -> 20248.68s]  one inventories gone, that's
[20249.36s -> 20253.21s]  It's especially the starter kits. We're not doing a second print on those
[20253.77s -> 20256.78s]  Well, the music didn't get looped
[20257.88s -> 20265.52s]  Stupid and idiot loop the music next time people are counting on you to play it
[20266.32s -> 20275.31s]  What's my favorite color? My favorite color was the color of the pool
[20276.47s -> 20290.52s]  That I built and house flipper. Alright, see you guys later. See you Wednesday. Take care of yourselves. Have a great night. Call your mother
[20291.04s -> 20293.04s]  season
