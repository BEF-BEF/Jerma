[150.96s -> 152.87s]  Now, uh. Because it's Halloween, right?
[152.87s -> 157.43s]  Jerma, as this is your show, would you like to kick us off here? I get to go first?
[157.43s -> 163.99s]  Yeah, you do. All right. Well, I think I'll take 17th century poetry for 50, please. All right.
[164.27s -> 170.73s]  Let's uh, let's see what we got here. John Calvin crafted this Christian
[172.05s -> 183.72s]  Ideology stressing God's power and the moral weakness of human beings that many of the era's poets followed. Uh, what is?

[199.03s -> 202.47s]  Congratulations, Dr. Schmoyzen. You have won the first points of the evening.
[203.03s -> 210.39s]  Uh, and uh, you know, as the rules of our super generic non-trademark finding show goes, you get to pick the next category.
[210.39s -> 213.36s]  What would you like to go for? I will continue with
[214.00s -> 222.29s]  17th century poetry, please for 200. 200. All right. Let's uh, let's start racking up these points here. Now,

[252.77s -> 259.44s]  How about Shannon wide open spaces for 400, please. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen.
[260.29s -> 263.25s]  Let's uh, let's see what's in this category. Let's open up this box.
[263.97s -> 268.45s]  This curious individual was the first person to ever look through at the moon through a telescope.
[269.84s -> 280.24s]  Uh, uh, uh, who is Thomas Harriot? Thomas Harriot? Who is Thomas Harriot? Yes, that would be the correct answer.
[280.56s -> 283.68s]  Thank you, Dr. Schmoyzen. That was Galileo. Wasn't it Galileo?
[284.16s -> 288.80s]  I'm, uh, not sure that Wikipedia would agree with you. Is that even correct? Apologies for this. That's not even correct.
[288.80s -> 296.00s]  That's not a correct answer. That's Galileo was the first person, wasn't it? That is right. Who the fuck is Thomas Harriot?
[296.32s -> 301.60s]  How do you, why do you know that? I guess he's a damn, he's a goddamn doctor. What am I talking about? Go on.
[301.84s -> 306.40s]  All right. Sorry about that, Dr. Schmoyzen. We have a little bit of a rowdy crowd this evening. It wasn't Galileo.
[306.64s -> 309.52s]  Uh, would you, uh, like to take us to the next question?
[310.16s -> 316.00s]  Yes, please. Uh, 17th century poetry once again for 400, please.

[338.10s -> 339.46s]  Well done.
[339.46s -> 344.34s]  Can I? Yes, Sheremo. How many of these are you going to get right? Can I answer a question? Is that possible?
[344.66s -> 350.15s]  Well, if you could get one right, yes. Well, I didn't, I got the first one wrong, but all right, go ahead. Keep going.
[351.41s -> 353.84s]  All right. Dr. Schmoyzen, take us back.
[353.92s -> 359.46s]  Surely. Um, let's go with wide open spaces for 800, please.
[359.70s -> 367.30s]  All right. Wide open spaces for 800. Measuring at negative 240 degrees Celsius.

[372.34s -> 377.86s]  Do you know it well, Dr. Schmoyzen? I do. What is the lunar south pole?
[378.42s -> 383.78s]  What? What? What is the lunar south pole? Yes. No, it's Neptune. That is the correct answer. What?
[385.14s -> 389.00s]  Neptune. Is it Neptune? I thought Neptune was the coldest spot on the galaxy.
[389.40s -> 391.40s]  What were the questions? Idiot.
[392.55s -> 397.88s]  Oh my. Oh my. It seems like we have a little bit of a rivalry here folks on this evening show.
[398.36s -> 403.16s]  All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. You're, uh, you're taking us away here. What, uh, what are you gonna crush next?
[403.64s -> 405.64s]  Certainly. Let's go for
[406.36s -> 415.51s]  water, water everywhere. All right. Four? How many points? How about 200 points? Water, water everywhere for 200 points.

[429.08s -> 431.96s]  All right. Let's take a look at that answer. What is the Dead Sea?
[432.66s -> 436.84s]  Correctamundo there, Dr. Schmoyzen. Jerma, how you feeling right now? We should have invited Burger Boy.
[437.65s -> 439.96s]  Because he's getting all these answers right.
[439.96s -> 444.92s]  Uh, so how does it work if he gets it wrong that I get it right? I can answer or we can answer, right?
[445.24s -> 450.20s]  Should he ever? We're in this together. Yeah, Chad. Chad, how you feeling right now? How's it going out there for you folks?
[451.11s -> 453.67s]  I mean, I kind of wish I could answer a question.
[454.23s -> 461.65s]  I feel like Chad feels the same way. Go on. Go on. No, keep going. All right. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. Take us away.
[461.97s -> 464.21s]  All right. Let's try
[465.65s -> 468.45s]  to be or not to be for 50.
[469.17s -> 471.83s]  To be or not to be for 50 points? Absolutely.

[488.07s -> 493.27s]  We get double points. Put that down here. I get points for that. Let's uh, let's take a quick point check.
[493.51s -> 496.79s]  What do we got here? So we have Jerma, proudly.

[532.55s -> 537.32s]  I would love to talk on my own stream. It'd be great. Eventually.
[538.20s -> 542.71s]  I've got the buzzer here, but gone. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen.
[543.03s -> 547.51s]  Why would you like to blow us away with next? Let's go for a 17th century
[548.05s -> 551.19s]  poetry for a 100, please. Gonna be easy.
[551.51s -> 558.84s]  It's gonna be like who is. One of the most influential poetic figures of this era. Most know him now by only two syllables.
[560.07s -> 562.24s]  Who is Voltaire?
[564.05s -> 571.01s]  And the answer. Yes. Who is Voltaire? Congratulations, Dr. Schmoyzen. You really know your stuff. How can I say?
[571.33s -> 576.61s]  How do you know all this stuff? It's frankly quite embarrassing. You're a lie detector doctor. You shouldn't know all this information.
[578.04s -> 584.44s]  Maybe you do. I don't know. Maybe. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. Next category. Yes, indeed.

[614.98s -> 615.94s]  What?
[615.94s -> 622.02s]  There's no way you know that question's answer. What do you mean? I should have known that. What does that mean?
[622.26s -> 628.50s]  What does what does happen? I mean, that's why you have it. All right, Dr. Schmoyzen. Take us away.
[629.40s -> 631.40s]  I could have got that question right. How much was that worth?
[633.33s -> 634.69s]  Let's try.

[1117.94s -> 1128.77s]  Goosebumps volume 58. Naruto. C. Kushina Uzumaki and D. Hiruzen Sarutobi.
[1131.74s -> 1137.79s]  Jerma, might you have an opinion? This is not a Goosebumps book. This is a, this is a Naruto
[1137.79s -> 1147.84s]  question. They were just pumped in to be mean to me. Okay. Who is Naruto's father? Yes. Minato
[1147.84s -> 1158.93s]  Kakashi, Kushina or Hiruzen? I'm going to say, I'm going to say, well, wouldn't it be Naruto?
[1158.93s -> 1163.89s]  Something Naruto? What's, what's Naruto's first name? I'm not sure that that's how their family
[1163.89s -> 1167.41s]  names work. Do you know Naruto's first name? Not sure if there's a logic behind this. No, no, no,
[1167.41s -> 1172.27s]  wait, it's Naruto Uzumaki. I'm not going to say it out loud because you'll get it. It's, uh, wait a
[1172.27s -> 1176.27s]  minute, but you'll hear it. I'll tell you. I'll just tell you. I'm going to whisper it to you. Okay.
[1176.27s -> 1183.09s]  Okay. The answer that I'm going to give is in case I don't want them to hear. All right. I know
[1183.09s -> 1187.74s]  Naruto. You really going to know what the fuck I'm doing? Absolutely. I gave my answer. Not a
[1187.74s -> 1194.30s]  doubt in my mind. Doctor, go ahead. Oh, yes. Let's uh, well, let's, let's let chat chime in here.
[1194.30s -> 1199.66s]  Oh, chat has an answer. Chat, how you doing over there? What do we got for chat? All right. So chat
[1199.66s -> 1207.33s]  has voted A, Minato Namikatsu. Wait, what? Yes. Why did they do that? Why? Because it may be the
[1207.33s -> 1214.26s]  correct answer. Why did they do that? I could not tell you. It's, it's, all right. All right. Doing
[1214.26s -> 1222.18s]  great. Doctor, we're all friends here. Don't be frozen. You know anything about anime, doctor?
[1222.18s -> 1233.09s]  Certainly. Uh, it's D, Hirose and Saratobi. D. All right. So chat has voted A. We have Jeremie over
[1233.09s -> 1241.15s]  here with C and the doctor with answer D. Now, uh, what might be the correct answer? Who is Minato
[1241.15s -> 1247.82s]  Namikatsu? A. I need to get one point in this whole game. Otherwise it's going to be bad. Wait,
[1247.82s -> 1253.84s]  it's not, it's, I thought it was Naruto Uzumaki. It is not. But that's not, isn't that Naruto's
[1253.84s -> 1260.93s]  name? Is that, is that Naruto's name? Naruto Uzumaki? You don't know. Does anybody back there know?
[1260.93s -> 1267.26s]  Does anybody fucking know? I can't see the chat so I have no idea. What? Okay. All right. All right.
[1267.26s -> 1280.06s]  Where are they going next? Where are we going next, guys? And it is a somewhat even split.
[1280.06s -> 1283.90s]  Where are they? Somewhere in between. No one has a favorite. All right. It looks like Jeremie's life.
[1283.90s -> 1292.90s]  Okay. We're going to take this. Jeremie's life for 800. Okay. I hope to God you get this one right.
[1292.90s -> 1300.40s]  Oh, what is that? This is our, uh, daily double scare. Daily double scare. Okay. You may be asking
[1300.40s -> 1305.36s]  what that is. I don't know what that is. So does that, does that mean points are deducted or? It
[1305.36s -> 1310.35s]  means something fun is going to happen. What the fuck is that thing? What is that thing? Hey, hey!
[1311.47s -> 1317.49s]  All right. All right. Fun. That was fun. Here he is. That was fun. I think it is. That was very fun.
[1318.45s -> 1322.61s]  Okay. What was that? And who is that person? I don't remember that person being here an hour ago.
[1322.61s -> 1329.15s]  Well, he's a ghost. Can I stand back on my thing? I feel so much more powerful when I'm on this.
[1329.79s -> 1338.85s]  If it makes you feel better, yes. Oh, shit. That's better. All right. What's the question?
[1340.94s -> 1347.62s]  What is Jeremie's grandpa's last name? Once again, Jeremie. I hope to the Lord and Savior
[1347.62s -> 1358.88s]  that you get this correct. I, I know this. A. Boyle. B. Richards. C. Wilfred. D. Steelhelm.
[1363.60s -> 1371.86s]  I know. Tell me. Oh, you, I go first? Yes. Oh, um, but if I say it, then everybody's gonna hear it.
[1371.86s -> 1377.42s]  That's true. All right, chat. All right, do chat first, do chat first. Chat, what do you got for us?
[1377.42s -> 1392.91s]  How to check it? Oh, right. All right. I know what I, my turn. Okay. I'm gonna go with D. D.
[1393.63s -> 1407.71s]  All right. So chat has said D. Jeremie has said D. Dr. Spoitser? No, C. Wilfred, please. C. Okay.
[1408.27s -> 1413.79s]  There it is. All right. What is Steelhelm? Congratulations, chat, as it was your question.
[1413.79s -> 1418.96s]  I just wanted to give Jeremie a little bonus there that he got to answer your question. I did.
[1418.96s -> 1423.76s]  That's a good question. So there he is. That's an old question, too. That's really cool. All right.
[1423.76s -> 1428.48s]  So here we go, chat. Still your turn. Winning points over here. What do you got for us?
[1428.48s -> 1436.86s]  I wonder if it's Naruto's father again. Okay. You're, but you already did Jeremie's life. Yeah,
[1436.86s -> 1446.86s]  we already did that one. All right. Okay. So we have anime for 2000. Oh, boy. I wonder what this is.
[1446.86s -> 1452.54s]  Here we go. Another daily scare. Well, I can see you here standing there. So wow, this is really
[1452.54s -> 1463.81s]  fucking scary. Oh, no. There he is. He's scary. What's on his face? Oh, shit. That's what I
[1463.81s -> 1469.78s]  should have done. Another fucking Naruto question. All right. All right. Go on.
[1471.78s -> 1480.42s]  In Naruto, which of the following is not a current Shinobi village? A. Hidden star village. B.
[1480.98s -> 1490.80s]  Hidden grass village. C. Hidden rain village. D. Hidden ice village. And this is what is not
[1491.36s -> 1499.30s]  currently a village. It is not. There's a lot. I don't think any of their villages are out in
[1499.30s -> 1502.90s]  the open, honestly, based on these answers. Okay. Well, let's see. Whatever. All right, chat. Chat,
[1502.90s -> 1515.50s]  what do you got for us? What do you got, chat? What do you got? Are they voting? No, there are
[1515.50s -> 1521.38s]  more than like three animes that aren't Naruto, right? I don't think they know. Maybe talk to your
[1521.38s -> 1528.42s]  people. All right. So I'm going to say, all right, grass. I remember grass. That's like what Naruto
[1528.42s -> 1535.76s]  is in. Naruto is in grass village. A lot of grass. So definitely rain. Grass and rain. Naruto is from
[1535.76s -> 1541.60s]  grass village. So I'm going to say D. D. I don't know. That's what I'm going with. Okay. So Jared
[1541.60s -> 1548.00s]  comes in hot with D. Hidden ice village. There's no hidden ice village. Chat has let us know that
[1548.96s -> 1559.97s]  a hidden star village is their choice. And a doctor. I'll go with hidden star village. A. Sorry,
[1559.97s -> 1570.93s]  which one? A, please. A. All right. Well, we do have two winners. Yeah. Ice village. That's the one.
[1570.93s -> 1576.00s]  I knew it. I'm telling you. He's from grass village. There's only like two other options.
[1576.00s -> 1581.84s]  There we go. He's getting more points here. So not exactly taking the lead. 2800. Holy shit.
[1581.84s -> 1585.52s]  That's pretty good. That's pretty great. Yeah. Second place. Come on. You got to suck it up a
[1585.52s -> 1592.56s]  little bit here. Professors look a little sleepy here. All right. Jerma, your turn. I get to pick.
[1592.56s -> 1598.13s]  You do get to pick. Oh, all right. You know what? I got an idea here. Why don't we do
[1599.49s -> 1610.32s]  Jerma's content for 2000. Jerma's content for 2000. Hopefully. I hope so. How many
[1610.32s -> 1617.04s]  YouTube subscribers did Jerma have when he had 100 uploads? What? How would anybody know this?
[1617.04s -> 1633.36s]  10,000? B, 50,000? C, 75,000? Or D, 100,000? At any rate, pretty impressive. Do you know?
[1633.36s -> 1644.62s]  I could take a pretty good guess. Chat, go first. All right, chat. You go first. You go first.
[1644.62s -> 1650.83s]  Chat, what do you got for us? All right. So it seems that there's a little bit of a split
[1650.83s -> 1659.20s]  in chat. Really? But B is winning. So chat believes that you had 50,000 followers for 100 uploads.
[1659.20s -> 1670.75s]  I don't think so. I think it's more. No, or less. 100. Okay. My first, my first like 40 uploads went
[1670.75s -> 1682.75s]  to like 30 people. I know that for a fact. No, I'm going to write. I'm going with A. A? All right. So
[1682.75s -> 1690.19s]  Jerma's coming in with A. It might be a little too low. Chat has B. Dr. Schmoyzen. What is it?
[1692.02s -> 1704.66s]  You know what YouTube is? C. C. He doesn't know what YouTube is. Okay. What is 10,000?
[1704.90s -> 1711.15s]  Congratulations, Jerma. You know your own life. I know my own channel. It's doing great. And I'm
[1711.15s -> 1719.23s]  fucking posing. Let's do a little point check here. We have Jerma with 4,800. Climbing up on you.
[1719.23s -> 1724.11s]  Chat with 1,600. You guys are not doing very well. And the professor with 5,050. He's not doing very
[1724.11s -> 1727.33s]  well. Yeah, it doesn't seem like he's doing too well in the second round. I'm about to pass you.
[1727.33s -> 1731.97s]  Yeah, yeah. All right. So let's let chat pick the next question here. Get a little interaction.
[1736.77s -> 1747.41s]  All right. Where are we going? How are we doing? All right. What is that for 2,000? Frankly, guys,
[1747.41s -> 1752.53s]  I'm pretty excited for this one. What is that? What is that? What does that mean? What is that?
[1752.53s -> 1763.07s]  Maybe the category. Yes. Okay. Who is this? I have my own guesses, but I shouldn't say.
[1773.94s -> 1778.66s]  All right. A few seconds left on the clock here, Jerma. How is chat going to be able to answer this?
[1779.30s -> 1786.90s]  What do you mean, who is this? They can't answer this question. There's no choices here.
[1787.90s -> 1796.05s]  It's just who is this? All right. What are they writing? Is it a better idea? What are they
[1796.05s -> 1804.21s]  writing? It's a gnome is what they're saying. Okay. It's anum or it is gnome. I'm going to go with
[1807.44s -> 1820.74s]  a close-up of a mustache. A mustache? What's the red? What is the red? That's what I want to know.
[1820.74s -> 1825.22s]  Doctor, you're a doctor. What is that? Yes, doctor. Might you have a live opinion of this?
[1826.10s -> 1832.59s]  Sure. It's a rabbit. It's a rabbit. A rabbit? I'm going to go with a mustache. I'm going to
[1832.59s -> 1837.31s]  go with a mustache. A mustache. All right. So we've got a gnome, a mustache, and a rabbit.
[1837.31s -> 1846.37s]  Chat's answer is A. What is it? Which I hate to inform you, it's not a multiple choice question.
[1847.41s -> 1856.05s]  It's Ronald Reagan, folks. Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to
[1856.05s -> 1864.11s]  give out any points for this round. That's impossible. That is an impossible question.
[1864.11s -> 1869.39s]  I think we should all get 1,000 points. We all get 1,000 points for that one
[1870.19s -> 1874.83s]  because that's impossible. Mr. Albertson. You know what? No, fuck it. We're going,
[1874.83s -> 1880.98s]  what is that for 1,600? All right, he's taking the lead. Mr. Albertson. Let's go. Let's go. What is
[1880.98s -> 1893.50s]  it? What song is this? What song is this? Listen up, folks. What song is this? How are we going to hear
[1893.50s -> 1908.77s]  this? What? What song is this? You've got to give more than a tenth of a second. What song is this?
[1914.62s -> 1919.92s]  Do it again. I need you to do it again. Professor, where are you in all this?
[1922.88s -> 1927.68s]  We're both on the same page. I don't think we can both get this. Do it like a couple, two more times.
[1932.67s -> 1937.07s]  So chat's answer is in. Okay, chat's answer is in. So a couple more seconds here.
[1937.95s -> 1939.79s]  I'm pretty impressed with their knowledge, honestly.
[1939.79s -> 1951.65s]  There are like 700,000 songs that all of them start like that. I'm going to say
[1959.81s -> 1963.41s]  And time's up. Professor, what is your answer? I have no idea. I have absolutely no idea.
[1963.97s -> 1969.33s]  Row Your Boat. Row Your Boat, folks. Row Your Boat. All right. Actually, that's pretty good.
[1969.33s -> 1975.68s]  Chat's answer, Blue Daboudi by Eiffel 65. Jerma.
[1982.88s -> 1988.16s]  I don't think that's an answer. Whatever. How many points was that worth?
[1989.63s -> 1995.87s]  1600. All right. So chat got 1600 points just in that question. Congratulations, chat. What's
[1995.87s -> 2001.07s]  your final time? 3200 points. All right. We're still in third here, but we can still catch up.
[2001.71s -> 2006.72s]  All right. So chat, you're up next to pick the question. Let's see what you got.
[2013.52s -> 2020.72s]  15, 18%, 20%. All right. Jerma's Friends for 2000. Okay.
[2024.45s -> 2028.61s]  Oh, look at this. He's ready. Oh, look at that.
[2029.33s -> 2035.30s]  Too much. Look, let him see you. Let him see you. Go to this camera right here. Look at this. Look
[2035.30s -> 2045.81s]  over there. Let him see you. He's got like a metal face. There he is, folks. Hope you're enjoying
[2045.81s -> 2054.77s]  that at home. Here we go. All right. How many formal appearances has Mr. Sneak Man had? Mr. Sneak?
[2054.77s -> 2067.76s]  A, three. B, four. C, five. D, six. Formal appearances. That doesn't count. What do you mean
[2067.76s -> 2075.28s]  informal? Has there ever been an informal appearance? What's your opinion? Okay. One.
[2076.08s -> 2088.32s]  No, he wasn't even in Jerma, but one. Two. Chat, what do you think? Okay. I think I have an idea
[2089.20s -> 2098.10s]  because he was in like, he was in at least two. One, two. I have an idea. I have an idea.
[2099.47s -> 2109.14s]  I got an idea. All right. Jerma, what do you have? Five. C. Five. C. All right. So, Jerma,
[2109.70s -> 2120.64s]  answer C with five. Chat, A with three. Professor? A, three. That actually might be three.
[2120.64s -> 2128.38s]  That actually might be three. All right. It's six. What is six? What are they, though? Do we know?
[2128.38s -> 2137.41s]  Jerma Rumble 2, Jerma Rumble 3, Jerma Rumble Rumblehouse. Is it three? Do I not even know?
[2137.41s -> 2144.88s]  Is it three? Did you black out? There's only been three rumbles and then like one or two offshoots.
[2144.88s -> 2150.98s]  It's six? What's the other video? I have no idea. All right. I have no idea. Well, since you don't
[2150.98s -> 2154.80s]  know your own life, we're going to move on from this. Well, I mean, let's pull out random shit
[2154.80s -> 2159.30s]  from everybody else's life from 10 years ago and find out what it is. All right. Chat, what do you
[2159.30s -> 2179.20s]  have for us? And what is that for 1200? Our favorite category here in round two. Who is this?
[2179.20s -> 2186.51s]  That's either an eye or a mouth. I don't know. Bold statements there. Professor looks a bit
[2186.51s -> 2192.03s]  perplexed. But we don't get any. Nope. There's no way for us to answer this. Nope. That's all you get.
[2192.03s -> 2200.19s]  Eight grainy potato pixels. Why do you think they're spelling out? Is it like an I? I think
[2200.19s -> 2209.22s]  it's an I. There's no way anybody can answer. You think it's an I. I'm falling off my body.
[2210.88s -> 2216.78s]  Let's go with. All right, Jerma. Chat has their answer in. What do you got for us?
[2216.78s -> 2221.28s]  How do you mean chat has their answer in? They're very confident. There's a consensus already.
[2221.28s -> 2229.34s]  They're confident people. Okay. So chat has their answer in now. And it took them 15 seconds. Is
[2229.34s -> 2240.75s]  this something that I don't know that I should know? I'm going to say my eye. Your eye. Your own eye.
[2240.75s -> 2252.19s]  My own eye like zoomed in or something. Wow. All right. Chat, your answer is scout and professor.
[2252.19s -> 2263.39s]  That's pretty good. Lassie. Lassie. That's could be. Jeremy's own eye, scout or lassie. All right,
[2263.39s -> 2270.78s]  let's see who it is. It is the one, the only Genghis Khan. Could you at least have made these
[2270.78s -> 2276.56s]  like slightly related to like the community? Congratulations everyone, you all lost. That's
[2276.56s -> 2282.37s]  a painting of Genghis Khan. That's not Genghis Khan. That's a portrait of Genghis Khan,
[2282.37s -> 2290.16s]  right? That's a portrait. That's not a picture. All right, whatever. All right. Are they picking
[2290.16s -> 2305.36s]  again? Back to the board. Where are they going? Chat, what do we got? I think we know. What is
[2305.36s -> 2313.39s]  this for 800? Shittiest category. Best category I think you mean. Thank you doc. What song is this?
[2313.39s -> 2316.43s]  What song is this? Oh, I wonder what it is.
[2316.43s -> 2322.29s]  Oh, I've heard that one on the radio a thousand times.
[2334.98s -> 2341.98s]  Three seconds. A full three seconds. Do it. A full three seconds. Do we not have a full three
[2341.98s -> 2346.54s]  seconds if the song is not available? That's the whole song actually. That's the whole song.
[2348.59s -> 2352.19s]  Every song starts like that. Every single song in human history goes like
[2354.35s -> 2363.25s]  that and then it goes into the song. What song is that? Can you even name the song you just
[2363.25s -> 2372.88s]  saw? No, but they all do that. I don't know. Gorillaz. A Gorillaz song. Not even a single
[2372.88s -> 2383.57s]  specific one. All right. Might be a Gorillaz song. Congratulations to those three people.
[2385.01s -> 2388.61s]  If you can sort through all those comments, you may be one of them. Three people got this right?
[2390.61s -> 2395.52s]  How? Unless this is your favorite song and you just know it like it's just automatic.
[2395.52s -> 2402.99s]  Find them after an award. This is ridiculous. I think this is ridiculous. Oh wow. I mean I'm
[2402.99s -> 2406.83s]  creeping up on you and I'll probably I mean I'm getting close but you know. Not too close I hope.
[2407.47s -> 2414.72s]  I mean you're still in the lead but we'll see. And professor, your answer? Sound of music. The
[2414.72s -> 2434.88s]  sound of music, folks. You just played every dubstep stop. I don't even know how to say it.
[2434.88s -> 2441.39s]  You played every dubstep song I've ever heard. Is that correct? It was Beetlejuice. That's not
[2441.39s -> 2448.19s]  Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice goes. That's a dubstep mix. That's a dubstep mix of Beetlejuice. Yes.
[2450.02s -> 2453.14s]  Have you been on the internet? Yeah. That's what we listen to. What's going to happen in 20 more
[2453.14s -> 2460.38s]  years? Are they going to do a dubstep remix of the remix of Beetlejuice? How the fuck would anybody
[2460.38s -> 2463.82s]  know that? All right. So are we giving that to chat since three people got it right or?
[2466.85s -> 2470.67s]  No. They're going to be dropping glasses on the ground. It's going to sound like
[2470.67s -> 2473.87s]  Beetlejuice and they'll do it. It'll be like another remix 30 years in the future. God damn
[2473.87s -> 2478.43s]  millennials. All right. We're going to give that to chat. Congratulations to those three people.
[2478.43s -> 2483.39s]  You know who you are. Go wild. You're giving it to chat even though three people got it right.
[2483.39s -> 2489.79s]  And guess what category chat has picked next. What is that for 400? No, this better be really easy.
[2491.71s -> 2498.03s]  It's not. What do you mean it's not? Oh. Who is this? That's a lampshade. That's what you're
[2498.03s -> 2501.63s]  saying in that? No, I'm not saying it yet. I'm not saying it yet. All right. Hold on. The professor's
[2501.63s -> 2512.00s]  down. It's not. You're looking for the exit. All right. I think he's pretty done. All right,
[2512.00s -> 2525.10s]  Jeremiah. Give me your best shot. I know what I'd guess. It's an egg. It's an egg? No, it's not an
[2525.10s -> 2535.25s]  egg. Is it like an embryo? Yours are very thematic here. Is it like an egg? Is it like a zoomed in
[2535.25s -> 2548.35s]  egg? Like a microscope egg? All right. So we have egg. Egg. Chat says doge. Doge. And professor?
[2549.07s -> 2572.42s]  UFO kazoo. A UFO kazoo. Oh, it's actually. I hope for your sake it is a UFO kazoo.
[2572.42s -> 2579.90s]  Oh, it's Banjo Kazooie. Here we have it, folks. Banjo Kazooie. You got it pretty close.
[2581.55s -> 2588.51s]  You got it pretty close. A UFO kazoo. You just had to add an IE on the end and you would have
[2588.51s -> 2595.94s]  added it. Unfortunately, Dr. Shmoysen, that was not the answer we were looking for. A UFO shaped
[2595.94s -> 2607.65s]  kazoo? Or a UFO with a kazoo? Why don't you tell me? All right, Dr. Lee, the category.
[2607.65s -> 2615.41s]  This has been wildly concerning. Chat, we're going to let you pick the next one here.
[2615.41s -> 2620.53s]  Banjo Kazooie. A bit of a mess on site here. What do you mean what is that? We already did all of
[2620.53s -> 2627.98s]  them. They want more. All right. All right. There you go, Dr. Shmoysen. Well deserved.
[2627.98s -> 2633.66s]  UFO kazoo. Get that as a tattoo. I'm going to give you a clap for that one. All right. Who is
[2633.66s -> 2651.25s]  the narrow-toes father? Who is it? All right. Anime for $1,600. Good Lord. Who is the only
[2652.51s -> 2664.58s]  homunculus without... Excuse me. It's Ouroboros. I know. I've got the outfit on.
[2664.58s -> 2669.92s]  You better get this right. Who is the only homunculus without Ouroboros tattoo?
[2669.92s -> 2681.55s]  A. Envy. B. Pride. C. Gluttony. D. Sloth. But what anime? It's just anime. Who is the only
[2681.55s -> 2687.26s]  homunculus in anime that doesn't have a tattoo? Showing his true colors here. Honey, come on.
[2687.26s -> 2694.40s]  What do you think? I got this. Well, it seems like we have quite a consensus from chat. So,
[2694.40s -> 2699.20s]  they seem to have narrowed down. I actually do know this. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is my...
[2699.20s -> 2704.40s]  I hear people laughing. I hear people laughing back there. Multiple. And it's messing with my
[2704.40s -> 2709.20s]  psyche. All right. I know this because it's one of my favorite animes ever. It's one of the only
[2709.20s -> 2715.46s]  animes I've ever watched. That would be... Well, Doctor, why don't you answer for me? Pause. Yes.
[2718.32s -> 2725.92s]  C. Gluttony. All right. C. Gluttony. Pretty good guess. We have chat here. Strong answer. B.
[2726.48s -> 2730.88s]  Right. I said it at the same time. Wow. Right. There you go. Hey. Hey. Hey. Come on, man. Ready?
[2730.88s -> 2737.62s]  High five. Ready. Get in there. Well, I was talking to chat. He's in it. He's in it to win it here,
[2737.62s -> 2745.01s]  folks. All nine of us. All right. I'll still give you a high five, though. All right. So, the answer
[2745.01s -> 2751.17s]  is yes. B. Who is pride? Yes. How much was that worth? That was a really high point question for
[2751.17s -> 2757.46s]  being so easy. So easy. That was very easy. Have you ever seen Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood?
[2757.46s -> 2760.90s]  Not the original one. The original one, they split halfway through. Full Metal Alchemist,
[2760.90s -> 2766.80s]  Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is a real story from the manga. I'm sorry. No,
[2766.80s -> 2773.52s]  like the back here hid. Oh, I thought you said it's not. I was like, excuse me. Oh, my. Say it's not.
[2773.52s -> 2778.00s]  All right, Jeremy. We're going to give you this one. All right. We'll do Jerma985's content for
[2778.00s -> 2786.35s]  $1,600. I know my own stuff. All right. Jerma's content for $1,600. What did Jerma do to personally
[2786.35s -> 2796.75s]  thank his first 500 subscribers? A. Tell a personal story. B. Create a TF2 server. C. Lift weights.
[2798.27s -> 2808.90s]  The funniest part about this is the correct answer is like the shittiest one. Nothing. Jerma,
[2808.90s -> 2814.42s]  how about you go? Let's have Doctor answer first. Oh, yeah, Doctor. What do you think I would do?
[2814.42s -> 2823.58s]  Sure. How about nothing? Nothing. Strong nothing, Professor. What about chat? Chat? Chat's gone with
[2823.58s -> 2830.03s]  C. Lift weights. It is C. Lift weights. Doctor, you haven't seen my 500 subscriber thank you video
[2830.03s -> 2834.59s]  where I was in the bottom of my parents' Facebook, lifting 35 pound dumbbells, pretending to be really
[2834.59s -> 2841.22s]  cool? Possibly. You haven't seen that video? Best gift to us all. Yeah, I mean, it probably was.
[2841.22s -> 2846.53s]  All right. Wait a minute. Hold on a second. How many points is that? How many points do I have?
[2846.53s -> 2852.06s]  I'm doing pretty good. 6400 to be exact. Chat in. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2852.06s -> 2860.27s]  wait, wait. Chat just get all those points. Update. Jerma, we have... I want, I want Goose,
[2860.27s -> 2866.11s]  I get to go, right? Yes. I want Goosebumps Books for 2000. Let's go. Bring it in. Goosebumps for
[2866.11s -> 2875.20s]  2000. In Monster Blood, what is the name of the witch that gives the blood its abilities? A.
[2875.20s -> 2893.66s]  Sarabeth. B. Ymiriden. C. Valshesh. D. Syndral. In Monster Blood. Yes. You ever read the Goosebumps
[2893.66s -> 2901.12s]  Book? No. He must like reading Doctor. Yes, certainly. Doctor Professor. I mean, you've read
[2901.12s -> 2904.72s]  a lot of books, but have any of them been Goosebumps Books? I don't think you're allowed to wear elbow
[2904.72s -> 2910.88s]  patches if you don't read all of them. Oh, come on. Goosebumps? Goosebumps? Yeah, R.L. Stein. Great
[2910.88s -> 2917.62s]  literature. Yeah, that's good stuff. All right, I got my answer. Okay. I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna,
[2917.62s -> 2924.02s]  my reasoning for this answer is it's the only one that has a apostrophe in it, so that makes sense
[2924.02s -> 2929.71s]  to me. It's elegant. So I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say Valshesh. C. C. Valshesh. Because that's like,
[2929.71s -> 2933.63s]  oh, it's a scary name, because it's like, oh, it's Valshesh. It's like a different, you know,
[2933.63s -> 2943.41s]  that makes sense to me. And Chat, what was your answer? What was Chat's name? Chat says A.
[2944.29s -> 2950.75s]  That's like a regular name. It's a very regular name. Hello to all the Cerebets out there.
[2950.75s -> 2960.00s]  Professor? Valshesh. That's a good, right? That's a good answer. So we have two Cs and an A. That
[2960.00s -> 2963.52s]  means I'm as smart as a doctor, by the way, if anyone's watching. That means I'm as intelligent
[2963.52s -> 2970.42s]  as he is. All right, so the correct answer is A. Cerebetsh. It's actually Cerebetsh. It is Cerebetsh,
[2970.42s -> 2976.38s]  yes. It's actually Cerebetsh. The apostrophe proved you wrong, unfortunately. Okay, well,
[2976.38s -> 2988.67s]  that's all good. All right, Chat, since you won that round, where are we going? I believe...
[2988.67s -> 2993.89s]  There are no more what is this category, so stop choosing it. Please do not all choose
[2993.89s -> 3005.82s]  what is that. Anime. All right, anime for $1200. I think we have a specific crowd here. They do
[3005.82s -> 3013.68s]  know they're anime. I could... Rightfully so. What is the name of the cage in the hidden mist?
[3015.36s -> 3028.82s]  A. Hokage. Hokage? I don't even know this answer, but I know it's kage. It's kage and hokage.
[3028.82s -> 3044.58s]  That one. B. Raikage. C. Mizukage. And D. Kazekage. I already said it. A. All right,
[3044.58s -> 3051.92s]  well, we have your answer. That hurt my hand a little. Professor? Give me a minute.
[3053.60s -> 3068.32s]  Will do. D. Kazekage. Kazekage. It could be. I don't know. I think it's hokage. All right,
[3068.32s -> 3078.30s]  and then we have Chat's answer. C. Mizukage. And they are correct. What is Mizukage? Congratulations,
[3078.30s -> 3083.82s]  Chat. Congratulations. You won another, what was that, 1200 points? Is it 1200? I believe it was.
[3083.82s -> 3091.47s]  So what do you have now? Was it 9200? 10,400 points. They have broken the barrier, folks.
[3091.47s -> 3098.83s]  They're in the five digits. All right, congratulations. Are they going anywhere else?
[3099.55s -> 3108.61s]  All right. I'm sorry to say this, but I mean, you gotta get it. Come on. You know, you gotta
[3108.61s -> 3111.89s]  get a G. Come on. You're Jeremy's life for 2000? Let's see how well you do here.
[3113.79s -> 3120.35s]  Here we are. Jeremy's life for 2000. How did Jeremy get the scar on the back of his head?
[3120.35s -> 3129.94s]  A. Baseball accident. I know this, like very, very, very vividly. B. Being karate kid. C.
[3129.94s -> 3137.70s]  Falling off a ladder. D. Thinking too hard. Well, that's a funny meme answer for the last one.
[3137.70s -> 3142.35s]  I wonder, I wonder how many people actually get this. Me too. In the chat. I really am curious.
[3142.35s -> 3149.15s]  Me too. Because I think I've told the story, like, have I ever told the story ever? I don't think
[3149.15s -> 3156.34s]  I've ever told the story. Maybe I have. Professor, what do you think about Jeremy's life at this point?
[3156.34s -> 3158.98s]  How do you think he got that scar? I have a scar on the back of my head. Maybe you could take a
[3158.98s -> 3165.78s]  look at it later. Why don't we try thinking too hard? I see he's making fun of me. I know he has
[3165.78s -> 3171.06s]  like 132 IQ. He's trying to make me look bad. That's all right. Getting a little heated in here.
[3171.06s -> 3177.78s]  That's okay. That's fine. Everyone's allowed one, right? Chat says C. Falling off a ladder.
[3178.42s -> 3185.78s]  Well, unfortunately, you're all wrong. It's from B. Being the Karate Kid. Karate Kid was one of the
[3185.78s -> 3189.30s]  most popular movies when I was younger and my brother kicked me off the bed. We were doing it.
[3189.30s -> 3194.02s]  I smashed my head on the back of a fireplace. I actually had to get a bunch of staples in my head
[3194.58s -> 3199.78s]  and I remember it was very, very, very tragic. It was very, like, very, like, very, like, tragic.
[3199.78s -> 3202.98s]  It was horrible. Sorry. I remember it for the rest of my life. It's Karate Kid. That's correct.
[3203.70s -> 3207.94s]  Being Karate Kid. That's right. Not acting as Karate Kid. I mean, like, in that moment,
[3207.94s -> 3213.71s]  you were Karate Kid. I was like 11. Got it. How many points was that worth? 2,000. Why was
[3213.71s -> 3219.57s]  that worth so much points? And Jerma? Okay, so I get to pick now, right? All right. Absolutely.
[3221.09s -> 3226.53s]  Why don't we go with, I'm going to stay there. Let's go. Jeremy's Life 1600. I'm going to bank
[3226.53s -> 3233.63s]  points here. Jeremy's Life for 1600, folks. During what year did Jerma's brother get married?
[3234.43s -> 3245.54s]  A. 2009. B. 2010. C. 2011. And D. 2012. Jerma, do you know?
[3247.41s -> 3252.45s]  That's really easy to get wrong because it's a four-year span, so I could be,
[3253.41s -> 3267.02s]  I hope you're not watching because I'm probably going to get it wrong. I have an idea.
[3273.06s -> 3276.50s]  25% chance of getting it right here. There is a 20, but it's like, look, okay,
[3277.46s -> 3283.44s]  let me explain. There's a way, when you have a span of, like, a lot of people got married
[3283.44s -> 3289.20s]  during that time. I had my brother, my sister, a bunch of friends, and it all happened between,
[3289.20s -> 3294.08s]  like, 2009 and 2012. We're looking for a one-sentence answer here, sir. Okay, I'm going to say.
[3299.14s -> 3304.74s]  I think the professor knows. Do you know this? He's there. I was actually at the, were you at the
[3304.74s -> 3309.38s]  wedding? You may have been. The best man, pay attention. I'm going to go with B. 2010. Final
[3309.38s -> 3318.64s]  answer. That's how this works on final millionaire. Final millionaire. I think it was 2010, I think.
[3318.72s -> 3322.43s]  It could have been 2009. I don't know. All right, so Jerma with B.
[3323.07s -> 3335.18s]  Chat, your answer. C, 2011. I don't think it was. Professor? B, 2010. Right, I know, come on.
[3335.74s -> 3344.02s]  B, 2010. All right, and here we have it, folks, the correct answer. What is 2011? Right. Okay,
[3344.02s -> 3351.47s]  well, I was, I was one year away. Just one. Just one. I mean, it was, all right, so I, I switched
[3351.47s -> 3355.78s]  him around. I switched him around. I switched him around. It's okay. I was, it was within like
[3355.78s -> 3359.94s]  eight months. Okay, that's fine. Happens to all of us. That's right. Okay. All the best of us.
[3361.39s -> 3364.19s]  Where's chat going? All right, chat, we're going to let you pick this next one.

[3385.38s -> 3392.50s]  father? We can't, we all can't get this wrong. I actually do not, I swear to God, I do not fucking
[3392.50s -> 3400.11s]  remember the, I don't remember. Seems like a personal problem, sir. I'm sorry. I don't remember.
[3400.11s -> 3403.39s]  I don't remember. I was paying attention. If you had to guess. Why would I not pay attention during
[3403.39s -> 3411.81s]  a quiz show? Okay, it's not, doc, it's, let's work together on this because, are we allowed to do
[3411.81s -> 3417.89s]  that? It was, it was not, okay, it was not Uzumaki. I remember that. What, what, what's the answer?
[3417.89s -> 3426.03s]  You remember? I don't remember. Try A. Is it A? Okay, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go with A. All right,

[3440.42s -> 3444.48s]  Thank you, doctor, appreciate that. Congratulations, everyone. Appreciate it. You've all won.
[3444.48s -> 3449.62s]  Who is Naruto's father? Who is Naruto's father? Let's see those points. Okay, so we have Jerma
[3449.62s -> 3454.82s]  in with 10,400. How many years are in the lead? Chat with 12,400. I'm gonna rip the
[3454.82s -> 3462.11s]  cord out from you guys. Then we have the professor here with his award-winning first round 5,850
[3462.11s -> 3466.83s]  points. That's just what happened. The tables have turned here, folks. All right, so who picks?
[3466.83s -> 3478.69s]  Chat? Chat's gonna get to pick this one. Jerma's friends for 1,600. My friends. I love all my
[3478.69s -> 3493.57s]  friends. All right, who eliminated Beanbag Sonic in Germania 2018? A. Glooman. B. Greenscreen. C.

[3543.55s -> 3552.34s]  back to the game. B. Greenscreen. We're good. Chat here with B, also Greenscreen. And professor?
[3555.33s -> 3565.74s]  D. Fireman. D. An enthusiastic fireman. Who is Glooman? Would be the correct answer for this round.
[3565.74s -> 3570.37s]  No, that makes sense. It does make sense. I'm gonna get off this. That's actually, like,
[3570.37s -> 3579.47s]  dangerous. Maybe we go back to your real height. All right, last question here, folks. This is the
[3579.47s -> 3588.22s]  last question? It gave me the last question. All right, Jeremy. What do you want to go for?

[3652.45s -> 3667.54s]  real video title? I wish all of them weren't. I'm gonna say B. B? Yeah, B. TF2. I promise I
[3667.54s -> 3670.90s]  will heal you. Yeah, I don't think I'd have that much bullshit in the title. Maybe I would.
[3670.90s -> 3677.98s]  We're looking for the real video title. Oh, okay, the real one. Yes. It's so confusing. There's so
[3677.98s -> 3696.38s]  many words. C. C. All right. Chat, what do you got? What is a real video title? Chat says B.
[3697.26s -> 3716.54s]  I promise I will heal you. Professor, any thoughts on the matter? C. That is a real title. All of
[3716.54s -> 3724.02s]  the above. All right. Okay. All right. Okay. So I suppose you would all get the points there.

[3757.01s -> 3761.01s]  you want to stop the stream? I mean, it is your show. No, no, no. Keep the stream going. I have
[3761.01s -> 3765.49s]  to go to the bathroom. Okay. All right. We will keep going with that. Stay strong. I hope you make
[3765.49s -> 3771.63s]  it. How many points do I have? Let's do a final count before he checks up. I have 11, 6. If they
[3771.63s -> 3778.51s]  change that, tell me, Chat, okay? There he goes. All right. 13,600. And Dr. Schmoyzen, what did you
[3778.51s -> 3787.68s]  have? I think, oh. 7,050. All right. Okay. So Chat, you're still in the lead here. All right. We
[3787.68s -> 3795.18s]  do have time for a couple more questions. Apologies for that before, folks. All right. So Dr. Schmoyzen,
[3795.18s -> 3815.78s]  would you like to pick? Certainly. I will take Goosebumps 400. All right. Sorry. Goosebumps for
[3815.78s -> 3825.25s]  400? That's right. In Welcome to Camp Nightmare, what was the name of the place in the camp where
[3825.25s -> 3834.99s]  nobody was allowed to answer? A. The Evil Chamber. B. The Ghost Room. C. The Forbidden Room. D. The
[3834.99s -> 3844.05s]  Forbidden Cabin. Are you that familiar with the Goosebumps books here? It's not exactly top of
[3844.05s -> 3854.93s]  my library. D. Forbidden Cabin. All right. So we have D. The Forbidden Cabin. Chat, what do you
[3854.93s -> 3868.24s]  got for us? All right. You've agreed with the professor D. The Forbidden Cabin. And our correct
[3868.24s -> 3880.56s]  answer would be? It is D. The Forbidden Cabin. Congratulations to all of you out there at home
[3880.56s -> 3886.70s]  and the professor. Wonderful. All right. So let's trade off here. Chat, we're going to let you pick
[3886.70s -> 3906.72s]  the next question. All right. So we got Goosebumps books, part two, for 1600. In The Abominable
[3906.72s -> 3912.48s]  Snowman of Pasadena, what allows Jordan and Nicole to escape the grasp of the snowman during their
[3912.48s -> 3923.23s]  first encounter? A. Loud construction work. B. A barking dog. C. A police siren. D. The cave
[3923.23s -> 3944.91s]  collapses. Professor, are you familiar with this specific work? No. Barking dog. All right. The
[3944.91s -> 3954.34s]  professor goes with B. A barking dog. Chat, could you help us out here? What do you got for us?
[3954.34s -> 3962.08s]  Chat agrees. B. A barking dog. All right. Let's see if we're all right here. The correct answer
[3962.08s -> 3974.48s]  is B. Congratulations to the both of you again. Well done. We're really racking up points here.
[3974.48s -> 3980.50s]  All right. Professor, we're going to let you go. Select a category. Select your points here.
[3982.64s -> 3991.94s]  Goosebumps, once again, for 800, please. All right. Let's go with Goosebumps for 800.
[3991.94s -> 3996.91s]  In The Haunted Mask, what does Carly Beth notice when she puts on the mask?
[3996.91s -> 4008.64s]  A. It doesn't fit. B. She looks taller. C. It changes her eyes. D. Her friend has the same one.
[4008.64s -> 4019.22s]  How embarrassing. She looks taller? All right. The professor's going to go with B. She looks taller.
[4024.94s -> 4030.83s]  Chat's going to go with C. It changes her eyes. All right. Well, let's see what happens in this
[4030.83s -> 4045.12s]  novel. It is C. It changes her eyes. Congratulations. All right. What points are we up to now?
[4051.52s -> 4057.41s]  16,400. Really crushing it out there, folks. Folks there at home. All right. Looks like you get to
[4057.41s -> 4087.01s]  choose the next question. We have Jerma's friends for 1200. Did Jerma kill Santa Claus? A. It was
[4087.01s -> 4096.43s]  self-defense. B. Jerma pleads insanity. C. No, he did not. And D. The magic can never die.
[4096.43s -> 4106.29s]  Professor, thoughts on this. Did Jerma kill Santa Claus? When's the last time you saw him?
[4108.77s -> 4115.66s]  Jerma pleads insanity. B. Jerma pleads insanity. Answer B. Chat, what are your thoughts on this
[4115.74s -> 4130.11s]  subject? All right. Also B. Jerma pleads insanity. All right. Let's see what our answer. What is
[4131.31s -> 4137.25s]  none of the above? Sorry, guys. This is one of our first rounds in a while. And it looks like
[4137.25s -> 4142.78s]  we're out of time. Thank you very much for joining us again here, professor. Let's get a final point
[4142.78s -> 4155.52s]  count. All right. We have Jerma currently in the bathroom with 11,600 points. Chat with 16,400.
[4155.52s -> 4162.32s]  Congratulations, guys. And the professor again with 9,050. We look forward to seeing you again
[4162.32s -> 4168.42s]  next time. I'm Shannon Cheryl. I will be on the next rumble. And we're going to go off and pass
[4168.42s -> 4378.64s]  this off to B.F. Bugleberry. I got something to tell you guys. No, no. Have we ever seen him again?
[4378.64s -> 4391.68s]  Have we ever seen him again? Who knows? Lord, I can't believe it. Ladies and gentlemen,
[4391.68s -> 4406.96s]  welcome to my scary, horrible portion of the screen if you don't know. Because I am B.F. Bugleberry
[4406.96s -> 4434.58s]  V1. And seeing all the feedback, I've seen what people have been saying. Every single person says,
[4434.58s -> 4441.87s]  Bugleberry, we love you. We love your stories. We love the funny things. You do the funny things.
[4441.87s -> 4456.37s]  You say the interesting, horrible things. What would I love to see something do from you? I've
[4456.37s -> 4465.26s]  seen the response. And I have something very special for you today to do one of my other passions.
[4465.26s -> 4472.93s]  That's not just scary stories. It's something else entirely, endeavorish, something awful,
[4472.93s -> 4479.01s]  something that you will throw up in your mouth when you see the disgusting thing that you're going to
[4479.01s -> 4490.56s]  see today. We're going to do pottery. Pottery with Bugleberry will show you the techniques you do.
[4490.56s -> 4498.40s]  If you will get your materials out of class, I will show you horrible ends.
[4500.64s -> 4504.93s]  Well, the first thing you need to do is you have all of your materials.
[4504.93s -> 4512.69s]  You need clay. You can get it at a local clay store. Make sure it is pottery clay.
[4515.84s -> 4519.44s]  We're going to slap that right in the center of our pottery here.
[4523.98s -> 4539.97s]  So full of demonic energy. Oh, I can feel it. Do that too if you need somebody to do that for you.
[4539.97s -> 4548.70s]  If you need somebody to curse your clay, you're probably asked, what do you use these for?
[4549.74s -> 4559.60s]  Well, you see, I get my friends together and all of us, all of us get together and we make urns
[4559.60s -> 4566.18s]  for all kinds of purposes. And what I'm doing right now is centering the clay. That's right.
[4566.18s -> 4573.70s]  You need to get a little bit more water. The thing about clay molding is you need to feel yourself
[4573.70s -> 4580.98s]  get into it. Don't just put your hands on the clay. That's not how it works. Get into the clay.
[4581.94s -> 4588.91s]  Feel it, center mouse. We are making today an urn to keep up.
[4592.51s -> 4599.74s]  That's what we're doing. Now, when I put my hand up, you want to make sure all the wheels
[4599.74s -> 4612.67s]  to put your hands in as if you are driving a car at 10 and two. Very tightly around the clay.
[4612.67s -> 4616.80s]  We are doing this to create a center mass, like I said before.
[4619.76s -> 4628.50s]  It gets very hot, especially if you get your clay from the underworld. Once we have achieved
[4628.50s -> 4634.10s]  the circle in the center, we're going to move with this part of your hand. Use the bone.
[4634.66s -> 4639.95s]  Don't use this part alone. That's not the part you're supposed to use. You're supposed to use
[4639.95s -> 4647.82s]  the pinky all the way down to the breastbone. You're simply going to place it here and you're
[4647.82s -> 4655.79s]  going to put some pressure down to give yourself a nice center. Just even pressure down the middle.
[4656.67s -> 4662.19s]  Not too much. You should end up a nice flat top like that. I have a little bit of an issue on the
[4662.19s -> 4667.15s]  side. You don't have to go full throttle. That's my father used to tell me. He said,
[4667.15s -> 4675.52s]  Barry, you don't got to go full throttle. I'd say, fuck you, Barry. I never saw him again.
[4676.32s -> 4685.68s]  So as we center the clay on to continue to put pressure down into the middle just enough to
[4685.68s -> 4703.23s]  give us a nice urn shape reminds me of a story. We don't need that today. We're just making urns.
[4703.23s -> 4715.60s]  And as I continue, and my people, we need to get really close in here. Make sure your clay
[4715.60s -> 4744.11s]  always needs to be wet. Do not ever try to mold clay. There's a large presence
[4745.15s -> 4748.99s]  in this part of the moment. I can feel it. There's something in this room.
[4749.79s -> 4761.09s]  But as I try to, what is that?
[4784.48s -> 4802.19s]  Don't worry. I got it on my bottom, everybody. As we continue, I'm going to start creating.
[4802.19s -> 4812.54s]  I do this with my friends all the time. We always get together. We create. Creation is incredibly
[4812.54s -> 4821.73s]  important. As you see, we have a nice piece here, which I'm going to now put my two thumbs down,
[4821.73s -> 4832.43s]  do this at home. Two thumbs go in. Just let the clay do the work we're trying to do.
[4832.43s -> 4841.60s]  If you need to wet your hands again, absolutely do so. I'm not moving at all. The clay is doing
[4841.60s -> 4855.87s]  all the work. Simply going down deeper and deeper. Mind-destructing portion of the clay. You see here,
[4855.87s -> 4864.34s]  if you got some scraps, give yourself a bucket. It's hard to squeeze sometimes because I can feel
[4864.34s -> 4872.19s]  the presence at the beginning. That's okay. How beautiful that is. Your stories are cool, but
[4872.91s -> 4881.42s]  how beautiful that is. You should come back. I'm getting deeper down into this clay,
[4881.42s -> 4890.13s]  just letting it do the work for me. Do not move during this procedure. You could get seriously
[4890.13s -> 4912.53s]  injured. I mean seriously. You have to go to the doctor. Working all the way down. You see,
[4912.53s -> 4934.66s]  we have a little portion. Don't touch it, Robert. No shortcuts here. I want that. Let's go look at
[4934.66s -> 4961.52s]  that. That's a big one. That's a huge one. Can I zoom in on this? I'm sorry. Just seems appropriate.
[4977.68s -> 4983.68s]  And only use this for touching up your piece. I'm putting gentle pressure down.
[4985.76s -> 4995.41s]  We pay attention to this portion of the clay. I'm just letting it do what it needs to do,
[4995.41s -> 5008.22s]  smoothing out the center piece. It is delicious. There we are. Like I said, once every two weeks,
[5008.22s -> 5016.85s]  me and all of my friends, we get together and we do it to a point where all of us can present.
[5016.85s -> 5023.57s]  And it's not about winning. It's not about winning. Oh, I didn't win. No, who cares if you won?
[5023.57s -> 5031.66s]  It's about creating. And that's it. That looks pretty good. We have a nice little piece in the
[5031.66s -> 5054.96s]  middle. I can move that. Two fingers down the box. Storing whatever you want in here. Could be
[5054.96s -> 5066.80s]  cigarettes. Could be cigars. If you have cigarettes, you can go. And remember, it's about constant
[5066.80s -> 5076.08s]  pressure. It doesn't need to be perfect. I tried to put together something and it didn't
[5076.08s -> 5092.56s]  turn out perfectly. Death flows through into the urn. Now, as you see, finishing the urn requires
[5092.56s -> 5106.08s]  newt. Finished up choked. Finishing the urn requires newt inside the center. And that's
[5106.08s -> 5121.86s]  for display only. The lid is very difficult and you can't make the lid until this portion is
[5121.86s -> 5136.61s]  completed. It's like eggs. Weirdly enough, but it's something I enjoy. And don't tell me when
[5136.61s -> 5146.90s]  I'm doing this. You shouldn't be making these things. Do you know what day it is today?
[5147.86s -> 5164.03s]  No trouble. So as you see here, I have finally crafted an urn that is full of god scar started.
[5164.99s -> 5182.64s]  Make the lid. If you put your finger down, just press it. Don't push down here. You will
[5182.64s -> 5202.13s]  ruin the lid you created. I'm not moving. Edge is turned up a little, but that's okay because
[5202.13s -> 5209.07s]  it needs to be just elegant. And elegance can come from destruction. It can come from chaos.
[5209.15s -> 5210.77s]  This is the rising wave.
[5226.56s -> 5246.43s]  Stop, stop, stop. Did you hear it? Sounded like a spirit was flying through. If I could only
[5246.43s -> 5266.24s]  catch him. Oh, if I could catch that spirit, he would be in a bad spot. For the lid, I have
[5266.24s -> 5271.58s]  two pieces that I'll be making. One is the top and the other is the bottom. This is the bottom.
[5272.14s -> 5286.26s]  Me too. Hello. What's the matter? Hold on, he's bitten somebody? Did he actually bite somebody?
[5287.97s -> 5299.55s]  Okay, he's eating raw hamburger meat backstage. He doesn't get on the house very much. He doesn't
[5299.55s -> 5307.97s]  get up very much. His face is very, very, he's not. It's all right. It's okay. Is it a problem?
[5307.97s -> 5325.39s]  Do you need me to go get him? Is anybody injured? Okay, well, just put some hamburger meat on the
[5325.39s -> 5329.47s]  ground. I'll go get him. You just put it in a trail over to a hook. You know the traps if they're
[5329.47s -> 5338.35s]  making looney tunes? You know the stick that falls down? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and
[5338.35s -> 5349.47s]  gentlemen, I have to be quite short because problems are a little difficult. 15 years, son of a bitch.
[5351.14s -> 5355.70s]  I will be back. You don't think you'll never see me again. You'll see me again.
[5369.60s -> 6069.41s]  Which one is this? Hello, how are you? I had a little. Hi, welcome back. We're currently set
[6069.41s -> 6074.80s]  up right now for the actual main event portion of the stream, which takes actually a little longer
[6074.80s -> 6082.00s]  than you would think, right? I'll explain what's going to happen here. I am currently for what I'm
[6082.00s -> 6086.00s]  going to do on the computer because we're trying to figure this out. Like, oh, what the hell are
[6086.00s -> 6091.46s]  you even going to do? We have a couple of things that I'm going to do for the actions. But if you're
[6091.46s -> 6096.13s]  just watching for the first time ever, right now, well, not right now, but when the round starts,
[6096.13s -> 6105.17s]  you know, over the last like three weeks, there has been at least three or four hundred actions
[6105.17s -> 6110.91s]  that the community has come up with to try to slime me on this broadcast. We have a couple of
[6110.91s -> 6117.68s]  angles as we see. And over the course of the next probably 40 to 50 minutes to an hour, we're going
[6117.68s -> 6123.38s]  to see if I do any of those actions. I do not know what any of these things are. I have no idea.
[6123.38s -> 6127.62s]  I have not been briefed. No one has told me, oh, Jeremy, oh, by the way, the action is say,
[6127.62s -> 6131.62s]  look at me. You know, that's like action number one. I have no idea. Hopefully that's not action
[6131.62s -> 6140.85s]  one because I just did it. But also at the same time, while I am doing this, you also are going
[6140.85s -> 6146.54s]  to be judged because there are actions that if you do them during these rounds without you knowing,
[6146.54s -> 6152.56s]  you will lose points. The points that we banked from over there, by the way, Bugleberry was $800.
[6153.20s -> 6158.74s]  Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that. It's the worst $800 I've ever spent.
[6158.74s -> 6165.26s]  And I absolutely will spend it again next year. So how this works again, each round we're going
[6165.26s -> 6173.41s]  to have a series of actions. When those actions happen, if I do one, I have kind of a death trap
[6173.41s -> 6177.25s]  up here that is going to slime me. If I do it during the round, you will be aware of those
[6177.25s -> 6183.47s]  actions. I will not. Who knows? We're going to keep score. If I get slimed, I lose points. If you
[6183.47s -> 6188.86s]  say a word that you're not supposed to say, you lose points too. And we're going to keep track of
[6188.86s -> 6195.20s]  them. You may even get banned too like that. That's probably not going to happen. So the game that
[6195.20s -> 6203.84s]  I'm going to be playing is plants versus zombies, because that was like the most easy thing to play
[6203.84s -> 6208.06s]  because it was like, oh, what are we going to play? Oh, I could play a horror game. I played them all.
[6208.06s -> 6214.69s]  I could play like a shooter game. I played them all. I could play a, I don't know. We've done
[6214.69s -> 6218.53s]  them all, right? So we've done them all. So I'm going to play plants versus zombies while we do
[6218.53s -> 6228.88s]  this. And when do we start? Oh, look at that. You can see it. That's coming at me. That's coming for
[6228.88s -> 6234.45s]  me. That is trying to kill me. Don't you understand? You thought this was all bullshit. You thought this
[6234.45s -> 6242.51s]  is a joke. No, we don't do jokes on this stream. We do real, real stuff. It's actually
[6242.51s -> 6249.92s]  kind of menacing and there is slime in there. Yes. So I have like a thing. Can we see plants
[6249.92s -> 6256.06s]  versus zombies? Oh, we're gripping game play. I'm going to play plants versus zombies. Oh,
[6256.06s -> 6263.10s]  look at that. It's a tutorial level. This is, this is great. We're recharging. Okay. So when
[6263.10s -> 6267.36s]  do we start around? Do we have any idea? Are we, are we going to get like started or should I just
[6267.36s -> 6276.00s]  play plants versus zombies for like two hours? How am I losing in the tutorial? Is that one of them?
[6276.00s -> 6280.02s]  That's not the first one, right? Make sure that's not the first one. I actually am losing.
[6285.70s -> 6299.63s]  So that we have the points should come up on screen. Do we have points? I can't even hear
[6299.63s -> 6306.54s]  this audio. So instead of secret slime action. Hey, I'm just like a weird guy in the lower
[6306.54s -> 6314.43s]  corner of your screen playing plants versus zombies. Oh, I got, I got a bomb that guy.
[6314.43s -> 6318.67s]  Imagine waiting for this stream. And it's just like, nah, nah, this is what we're going to do.
[6318.67s -> 6329.73s]  I'm just going to play play. That is what we're doing. Let's see how fast I can click it.
[6329.73s -> 6338.69s]  The real time killer. See if I can break the record. You know, I should just do that right now
[6338.69s -> 6344.37s]  while we fix the technical problems that are going on. Just click as fast as I can. I cannot
[6344.37s -> 6348.21s]  even, I actually can't even see chat. So I have no idea what they're saying. They could be saying
[6348.21s -> 6353.89s]  anything right now. Well, the guy in the Halloween costume. I'm not even in Halloween costume.
[6358.93s -> 6364.94s]  Oh shit. He's not out. Drop it on me. It's not the Halloween costume. So there are,
[6364.94s -> 6371.82s]  there actually are like 400 things. If I do them, then I'll be in a lot of trouble. We came back
[6371.82s -> 6374.54s]  to the break just because it was like, you know, just put me live. Do it.
[6378.00s -> 6382.88s]  I have like one of those secret service things. Actually losing in the tutorial. I know what you're
[6382.88s -> 6392.98s]  saying. And it's true. I actually just lost in the tutorial. I lost in the tutorial.
[6398.98s -> 6416.27s]  Well, shit. I'm going to try it again. Whoops. I was just, all right. You put the sunflowers down
[6416.27s -> 6420.11s]  and then when the sunflowers, okay, take the sunflower at 25. I remember, I know how this,
[6420.19s -> 6426.94s]  the whole back row is sunflowers. And then the next row is the pea shooters, right?
[6430.26s -> 6433.62s]  We got doctor, doctor, doctor. Dr. Sparks. Are you still in the house?
[6434.26s -> 6441.65s]  I think I need my blood pressure taken. So how are we doing? Are we, are we any closer?
[6444.22s -> 6452.94s]  Are we any closer to slime time? Or should I lose in the tutorial again? He's pretending to lose.
[6461.84s -> 6465.52s]  How many times can I win? I know I haven't played, this is actually a pretty good game.
[6466.40s -> 6469.92s]  The second one's stupid, but this one is actually really good.
[6472.96s -> 6480.86s]  Just dunk them, dunk them now. We're stalling. I might actually, this is what you do, right?
[6484.90s -> 6504.96s]  Works, works. Let me, let me just get a full row. Guy playing plans versus zombies.
[6505.84s -> 6510.16s]  That's why I baited you all. I baited you all here. We started with that trivia
[6510.16s -> 6520.53s]  round into like Bugleberry was here. Now, hey, settle back in the play. This is riveting.
[6525.70s -> 6528.50s]  The funny thing is, there's probably some of you here that are like,
[6529.30s -> 6533.46s]  now this is great. Just keep doing this. Let's do this for like another six hours.
[6535.71s -> 6540.16s]  All right, fine. Whatever. We will. Definitely not six hours.
[6555.92s -> 6563.78s]  So how are we looking? What'd you say? Secret service. What'd you say?
[6567.78s -> 6573.02s]  I've lost, I've lost communication. I've lost communication with the back team.
[6573.82s -> 6581.92s]  Wait, we're going? Wait, we're going now? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. We're going
[6581.92s -> 6589.54s]  right now. How long have they been there for? What? I thought I was still like, filling time.
[6590.72s -> 6595.94s]  Oh, now you freaked me the fuck out. Now I'm like, I'm scared. Wait, everything's ready.
[6597.81s -> 6612.56s]  What? I thought I was like, filling time still. Okay. So that means I'm armed. Uh, okay.
[6612.56s -> 6622.24s]  Okay. Let me put a back row. So let me first of all, my back is killing me. Let me just like,
[6627.04s -> 6633.50s]  my back is just absolutely killing me. You ever get like a tense back? I mean,
[6633.50s -> 6646.56s]  seriously, that's how you get like a bad back. That's how you get a bad back. You sit too long.
[6646.56s -> 6653.12s]  I was sitting for too long. That's my problem. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta watch out
[6653.12s -> 6665.84s]  down here. So wait, I have actions too. I'm sitting there just like, well, who knows if we're
[6665.84s -> 6677.87s]  starting or not. I hope I don't lose. Oh, I gotta put the onion there. If I put the onion there,
[6677.87s -> 6686.50s]  I win. I'm sorry. It's a walnut. I know what it is. Oh shit. Wait, I got one lawn mower down.
[6686.50s -> 6692.51s]  The thing is, I'm trying, I don't touch any, I keep, what if I don't touch anything?
[6695.04s -> 6700.96s]  How long is the round? How much time do I have in round to like, worry about this?
[6708.80s -> 6718.54s]  That makes it even worse about knowing because I'm completely in the dark.
[6718.54s -> 6734.08s]  Again, let me just like, good shot of him. I almost just dropped it. I almost just dropped it.
[6739.23s -> 6754.98s]  Yes. Cherry Bomb. Best gameplay you're going to watch on Twitch of Plants vs. Zombies 1.
[6756.46s -> 6762.62s]  We can talk about a quick story about how Plants vs. Zombies 2 took this formula and then they
[6762.62s -> 6771.78s]  turned it into a pay to win game that really nobody cares about. It's where people come back
[6771.78s -> 6776.26s]  to this game and they talk about how this is like, oh, what a fantastic, awesome game this is.
[6777.06s -> 6781.30s]  And the second one is just, I don't think anybody's ever played it. Only like,
[6784.90s -> 6789.22s]  I'm just moving. What did I do? Did I, what did I do? It started to, all right, this thing started
[6789.22s -> 6810.29s]  to move. So I'm going to stop talking about that. I heard like, I don't know what to say.
[6811.01s -> 6815.25s]  When you, when you have like nothing you're allowed to say, you have no words to say.
[6817.39s -> 6823.79s]  I could, I could just like say, I don't know. I don't know. I'm scared. You guys, okay.
[6824.75s -> 6831.39s]  You just have, oh, there are points. There are the points. I can see them. You guys have,
[6831.39s -> 6836.11s]  where'd you guys have 16,000 points from? Oh, from the trivia. Right. That's right.
[6838.19s -> 6852.72s]  This game is like, oh, this game is good. I'm trying to think of something. Imagine one of
[6852.72s -> 6858.99s]  the actions is play Plants vs. Zombies 1. No, touching the nose is, it might be one of them.
[6858.99s -> 6867.86s]  I ain't going to do it. A huge wave is approaching, but from what direction? East? West?
[6875.82s -> 6891.06s]  I, how do you get more? No, I have to actually set this up, don't I? I got to be careful because
[6891.06s -> 6894.58s]  every time I get, if I get slimed and I lose like, how many points do I lose if I get slimed?
[6895.94s -> 6900.26s]  500. That's not good. Well, it's probably not going to happen. So that's fine.
[6901.38s -> 6904.85s]  I'll just be quiet the whole time and just actually play this game.
[6907.84s -> 6920.11s]  That's what we're doing. I have a lot of money. When is the round end?
[6920.11s -> 6955.20s]  Oh, click to remove it. Wow. This is, I love Plants vs. Zombies. Now we're going bowling.
[6956.00s -> 6969.22s]  I should, I should just like dance on camera. Just dance in action. Oh, it's been to the left.
[6969.22s -> 6980.21s]  Right, right, right. Oh, it's bowling. Okay. I would laugh my ass off if this just didn't happen
[6980.21s -> 6989.22s]  one time. If this doesn't happen once, I will fucking laugh. Hey, we set all this up and it died.
[6989.22s -> 7000.14s]  Nope, not going to happen. This is the big explosion one, right? Oh, by the way,
[7001.02s -> 7006.11s]  I got some cool clothes on.
[7015.78s -> 7022.90s]  How was your guys Halloween? How was your guys day? Did you guys have a good day? My day was great.
[7028.46s -> 7036.14s]  I did, uh, well I did all this. I set all this up and it was really good.
[7038.43s -> 7043.79s]  Do you remember, you guys remember when conventions, when people would wear these
[7043.79s -> 7047.95s]  to conventions, it was a huge thing. Why would they not make Plants vs. Zombies 3?
[7048.99s -> 7052.99s]  Everybody loves this franchise. This is gonna make a mobile game and that's it. Make it free.
[7052.99s -> 7074.62s]  Make it a real game. Oh, with ricochets, right. You gotta try to get free. There we are.
[7078.53s -> 7080.85s]  Why did I just do that? That was stupid. I gotta hit this guy.
[7086.22s -> 7089.18s]  Yes. All right, final wave.
[7092.86s -> 7100.00s]  Everybody has this. I remember being at PAX East in like 2012 and they would just be cones.
[7108.77s -> 7111.81s]  I'm going to win this. I'm definitely going to win.
[7115.17s -> 7118.69s]  All right, if it's not like, oh, touch your nose, touch your face. Look out. Whoa,
[7118.69s -> 7122.93s]  what happened to you? Oh, watch it. Watch his bum. Watch out for his bum. I am safe,
[7122.93s -> 7132.77s]  I think, this whole round. There's like, yeah, no, call this round. I'm not, it's over. I win.
[7136.90s -> 7140.58s]  They didn't get shit. Hey, what was, what was your word by the way?
[7143.98s -> 7148.86s]  Their word was diaper. Your word was diaper. How did you do?
[7148.86s -> 7160.74s]  You. Minus 800, 840 of you said the word diaper. That means you lose. That means you lose 800
[7160.74s -> 7174.83s]  points because one person's worth one point. Nothing happened to me. I'm fine right now.
[7177.82s -> 7181.20s]  It was probably something really specific. It was probably like,
[7183.76s -> 7188.77s]  talk about Jemercraft. Actually, I probably shouldn't say that word.
[7188.93s -> 7199.78s]  So we're officially on the second round in five seconds. We've got the next round, the next round.
[7201.14s -> 7213.34s]  I, I thought it was going to be way more than 800. That means I actually cannot get son. How
[7213.34s -> 7233.15s]  many people are here? How many people are watching the stream right now? All right. So out of 7,400
[7233.15s -> 7239.07s]  people, only 800 of you, I'm wearing a fucking diaper on screen. How did you hope you could
[7239.07s -> 7245.17s]  contain that? You could contain yourselves during that? I don't know how that's possible.
[7247.17s -> 7254.30s]  Wait, is the word still banned in the chat? No, it's not. Okay. Thank God I unbanned it.
[7254.30s -> 7259.26s]  I thought it was still banned. It was banned like two months ago. So we're on round two, right?
[7260.22s -> 7272.77s]  So this is new actions, right? Not the old ones or are you compounding them?
[7277.92s -> 7287.52s]  All right. So, all right, put my hands down. I'm going to put my hands down.
[7291.25s -> 7298.98s]  That means you guys have a new thing too. Watch what you say for the next little bit.
[7301.60s -> 7320.22s]  Be careful. Something about like something about my hair is just fucking bothering me.
[7322.80s -> 7331.42s]  Something about it. I don't know what it is.
[7334.54s -> 7340.30s]  Maybe it has to do with the fact that they're right. What are you doing? What did I do? What did I do?
[7340.30s -> 7342.86s]  What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What?
[7343.66s -> 7357.81s]  What did I do? What? What did I do? What was the action? I touched my hair.
[7359.20s -> 7371.81s]  I touched my hair twice was the action. Well, how many fucking people said that I had? Oh,
[7371.81s -> 7378.96s]  for the love of God. Did I just, how many points? 500 points? How am I going to play?
[7380.74s -> 7384.10s]  We didn't think this through. We didn't think this through. How am I going to play?
[7384.98s -> 7394.70s]  I can't play the game. I can't do anything. My fucking hand cannot come back down here.
[7395.26s -> 7400.64s]  Touch your hair twice. Oh, for the love of God. This stuff stinks.
[7403.73s -> 7409.97s]  This smells so bad. Does that end? Can we go to the next round? Oh, we keep going.
[7411.65s -> 7420.37s]  I need to play with my left hand. Thank you. I just got a towel.
[7421.09s -> 7432.27s]  This is my eye. This stuff, this smells like baby puke. I don't know why I know that. It
[7432.27s -> 7440.86s]  just smells like baby puke. Am I losing it in the game? I'm not even paying attention.
[7441.98s -> 7457.06s]  All right. I need to, okay. We're good. The thing is I heard, I heard like the crank
[7457.06s -> 7462.77s]  and that's when I was like, what the fuck happened? What's the score? 11, what is it? 11 what?
[7463.49s -> 7472.45s]  1100. Okay. I didn't lose it. I won actually. That's good. The thing, this is going to be
[7472.45s -> 7479.09s]  horrible. Honestly, I'm not kidding around after one. Cool. Let's not ever do that again,
[7479.09s -> 7488.22s]  because now like I feel like shit. Let me fill this back up. Oh, we're still on that same round?
[7488.86s -> 7507.12s]  Good thing I'm wearing a diaper. All right. I got the, I got the ice snow pea. So Jesus Christ.
[7511.65s -> 7518.35s]  Oh, don't touch my face, right? Oh, touch my hair. Should I not touch anything? But what if I have
[7518.35s -> 7536.46s]  to rub my face? Cause there's slime in my eyes. All right. How does it look? This shit's not even,
[7536.46s -> 7546.69s]  this is not even orange. It's like fucking, it's like, it's like white. It's supposed to be orange,
[7547.25s -> 7555.15s]  but I don't think it doesn't. Is it because of the light? It looks like it's like pale.
[7556.03s -> 7558.03s]  It should have been a green. That would have been better.
[7563.10s -> 7580.38s]  I need like, it's like, it's hardening in my like ear canal. Hey, welcome to the,
[7580.38s -> 7598.14s]  hey, welcome everybody to the stream. I gotta, I, all right. What do you, I, what do they have?
[7598.14s -> 7608.75s]  Okay. Can you pump it to me what they have for action? So this round is over. The word was
[7608.75s -> 7613.63s]  bald, by the way, but apparently in doing so, I had to touch my head twice, which is technically
[7613.63s -> 7617.07s]  my hair, but it's not really my hair. So that's a technicality. I don't believe that that should
[7617.07s -> 7625.44s]  be allowed. Do you guys have a timer up? Just going by, you know what? I can see the chat.
[7626.24s -> 7638.98s]  Why is everybody saying he said orange? What do you mean? He, what are you talking about?
[7638.98s -> 7644.82s]  He just said it. Orange is, orange is one of the words.
[7653.28s -> 7662.90s]  Somebody just shit in my pants. Somebody shit my pants. I didn't do it, but somebody else very
[7662.90s -> 7675.89s]  clearly did. Holy shit. The word was orange. I talked about how this didn't look orange.
[7683.34s -> 7688.46s]  Can we, can we like watch a movie or something? Because I can't even, I can't even touch the
[7688.46s -> 7700.69s]  screen. I can't touch anything. Are we on a new round? I just got an achievement. Watch rat movie.
[7702.21s -> 7709.86s]  No, that's probably an action. Actually, it's going to happen with playing Plants
[7709.86s -> 7713.38s]  vs. Zombies because like there's no way I could have done anything else. Oh dude, what the fuck?
[7713.38s -> 7724.16s]  You should be playing like Soma. Yeah. Should I? I'm sticking to the ground. Jesus.
[7729.09s -> 7743.26s]  Your hair looks dumb. Wait, I didn't do anything. Are we on a new round? We're on a new round,
[7743.26s -> 7746.06s]  right? I just like burped really loudly and hopefully that's not something.
[7746.86s -> 7751.63s]  What am I doing? I gotta, I gotta get rid of this guy. It's hard to even grab.
[7752.35s -> 7763.04s]  Oh, you guys don't understand. I don't have a mouse pad. It's slime here. Slime is my mouse pad.
[7764.40s -> 7774.66s]  I think like, really? How am I going to do this? Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no. I can't
[7774.66s -> 7777.46s]  lose. I can't lose. I can't lose. I can't lose. I can't lose. I can't lose. Don't lose. Don't lose.
[7777.46s -> 7787.09s]  Please don't lose. I'm going to lose. Look, you don't have to deal with somebody getting slimed.
[7787.09s -> 7794.61s]  I do. I have to deal with somebody sliming my ass. It's actually in like the back of my underwear
[7794.61s -> 7799.65s]  and every time I get up and get down, it's like, it's the worst feeling ever. What's,
[7799.65s -> 7804.21s]  what are we slated to do here? Like an hour and a half. Uh, just kidding. More like 25 minutes.
[7804.85s -> 7818.83s]  See you guys next time. Cut his mic. If I lean over good enough, I can see. All right. So
[7822.69s -> 7830.61s]  here we go. New round, new time. Let's do it. I have to at least win one round.
[7830.61s -> 7843.25s]  Did they, how many? Okay. So it's 10. What is it? 10? What is it? I can't see it from there.
[7843.25s -> 7852.45s]  10 what? We're, we're, we're in a new round, right? Am I on actually new actions right now?
[7853.17s -> 7857.02s]  People are spamming show the actions, show actions. I don't even know what they are.
[7859.26s -> 7862.78s]  Oh, new actions are going up now. I think I'm just playing, playing for zombies.
[7863.50s -> 7870.21s]  I think. Well, show actions, show actions, show actions. There we go.
[7871.01s -> 7873.25s]  Do they, we haven't, are they up? Okay.
[7888.02s -> 7912.40s]  Spitters. Hey, mine. How long does the arm take to mine? 20 seconds. 25. This is so unnerving
[7913.28s -> 7916.80s]  because I just hear like production people like going like this. I hear them like
[7919.68s -> 7927.58s]  they're like moving around back there. All that happens is you guys lose points. What happens to
[7927.58s -> 7931.82s]  me is somebody goes to the bathroom in the back of my underwear as it happens to me.
[7932.70s -> 7957.58s]  I'd rather have it hit me in the face. Seriously. I have to win this. I'm starting to harden.
[7963.98s -> 7973.26s]  All right. I need to take care of this guy. Okay. Look at how covered I am in shit. I am from like
[7973.34s -> 7980.70s]  up to down. Let's get you a towel. Let's get you a towel. This is like a face cloth.
[8008.80s -> 8015.31s]  Don't lose again. The gameplay is what matters on this stream. Nothing else matters. Only the
[8015.31s -> 8025.04s]  video game is being shown. What's going on? What's wrong with the computer? Just blue screen. Wait.
[8025.04s -> 8032.72s]  Oh, wait. The computer blue screen. What? Oh shit. That's an action. That's an action for the
[8032.72s -> 8049.95s]  computer. Oh, God damn it. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, I was like, what's going on here? It's like
[8049.95s -> 8065.81s]  smoking. The computer is smoking from the back. It's smoking. How many points does the computer
[8065.81s -> 8077.28s]  lose? How many points did the computer have? Is it all right? Somebody reboot it. Can you reboot
[8077.28s -> 8091.18s]  it? If you hit control, I'll delete on it. See if it works. Let's see. No, I'm not getting anything
[8091.18s -> 8115.10s]  from this PC. Should I blow on it? Damn. Okay. What do we do? Okay. Because that's actually like
[8115.10s -> 8123.07s]  this thing's dead. I'll have my iPad. Do you want to bring up my iPad? Okay. I'll get my iPad.
[8124.21s -> 8542.72s]  We can play something on the iPad for a while. I'm Jerma and now we're going to play iPad games
[8542.72s -> 8549.95s]  because that's what we have. Yeah, it's not just you and me. It's the computer as well as involved
[8549.95s -> 8554.91s]  in this. This is actually caking. It's an iPad stream. This it is. You didn't think we were going
[8554.91s -> 8561.07s]  to come back to this, but we always do. So where do we stand on points? I am currently losing
[8561.07s -> 8570.64s]  because I went to the bathroom during the trivia. I had a long piss. It was about four minutes.
[8571.44s -> 8581.01s]  But we have right here in our hands Halloween themed horror games. And we are going to start
[8581.01s -> 8589.30s]  with one called Spirit Oracle Board. If you don't have TikTok, now's the time to get it.
[8591.06s -> 8597.52s]  There are ads on this. I'm going to do it. The scary stories. I'm not going to click that. It's
[8597.52s -> 8603.36s]  going to open up like a webpage. All right. Start the seance. Okay. We got a full page TikTok ad.
[8608.69s -> 8615.94s]  Okay. Instructions. Can we get some ambience in here? If possible, darken the room. You are in
[8616.90s -> 8624.90s]  and light some candles before starting a seance. Place your finger on the planchette.
[8625.46s -> 8631.79s]  Is that the term? The wooden piece in order to initiate the spiritual connection to the other
[8631.79s -> 8637.39s]  side. Ask the spirit your question loud and clear. Always start a seance with a question,
[8637.39s -> 8642.90s]  is anyone there? Wait for the spirit. This is a lot of, this is a huge amount of questions.
[8645.49s -> 8650.93s]  This is a huge amount of instructions here, not questions. Wait for the spirit to respond. The
[8650.93s -> 8655.89s]  planchette will start moving. Okay. Always be polite and ask normal questions. This is a way
[8655.89s -> 8662.11s]  to make it so kids don't say anything bad. Right? Don't say anything mean. Don't say fuck. Be careful
[8662.11s -> 8669.41s]  not to upset any spirit. A couple running around here today actually. In case you have anger to
[8669.41s -> 8673.89s]  spirit, quickly move the planchette to goodbye before the countdown is over or unexplained
[8673.89s -> 8685.09s]  things might happen. Sure. Speech recognition required. Do we actually have to do this? Do I
[8685.09s -> 8693.39s]  have to do, do I have to allow speech recognition? I don't want this like, you talk, you can always
[8693.39s -> 8701.57s]  change this later. Okay. So I allow access, right? Are we good? Spirit would like to access speech
[8701.57s -> 8709.14s]  recognition. Okay. Why does it need to know all this stuff? Listen to your microphone. Okay.
[8711.30s -> 8722.37s]  Turbo seance. Unlock these special features. Turbo seance. Messages will, no, no, thank you.
[8722.37s -> 8726.37s]  I don't think I need to do the turbo seance. Place fingers on the planchette to start.
[8726.37s -> 8733.41s]  Do we have any scary music going here? We do? Okay. Place finger on planchette to start. You've
[8733.41s -> 8749.90s]  got it? Ask. I don't know what to ask. Do you, are there any spirits here? Are there any spirits here?
[8758.90s -> 8788.67s]  Are there any spirits here? Are, are there any spirits here? Oh shit. You're going to see me
[8788.67s -> 8803.97s]  doing this. This thing sucks. What? Hello. Let's try it again. Warning. Seance in progress. If
[8803.97s -> 8815.01s]  you've made contact with a spirit, you should end the seance by moving to the goodbye. Exit. I love
[8815.17s -> 8822.72s]  how you, I love how you cut that. I saw you go, but look, no, no, no. Come back. Come back.
[8822.72s -> 8830.59s]  They're doing it. They're doing it. Look, that's like G. Oh no. So you got the bomb. Oh shoot.
[8831.74s -> 8838.06s]  Oh shit. What monster is this going to summon? Oh, the rainbow. That means you got five.
[8838.78s -> 8844.94s]  Give me a fucking, no, I don't know. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I don't want to,
[8844.94s -> 8848.08s]  I'm going to try this one more time and then move on to the next fucking iPad game. No, thanks.
[8848.32s -> 8868.51s]  Place. Okay. Are you here? This thing even, does this even do anything? Do we know if this even do
[8868.51s -> 8877.54s]  anything? I don't think this does anything. This is fucking stupid. All right. I'm going to hit the
[8877.54s -> 8883.25s]  button and we're going to do another one because, okay, I'm going to hit the button. That's the end
[8883.25s -> 8895.26s]  of the round for chat. The word, what? The word was turbo. How many points did they lose? Holy shit.
[8898.00s -> 8905.07s]  That's some next level baiting if I've ever seen it. All right. Do I want you to show? Okay.
[8905.07s -> 8920.62s]  This is granny two is this one. This is granny chapter two. So do I have new actions?
[8921.42s -> 8934.72s]  I didn't do anything, right? We're going to keep the same one. All right. We're going to do normal.
[8937.71s -> 8945.04s]  Granny play as options. That's fine. Normal quality. Granny and grandpa move at normal speed.
[8945.12s -> 8951.17s]  That's fine. Be quiet. Granny hears everything. Grandpa doesn't hear very well, but he hits hard.
[8954.40s -> 8957.68s]  Press and hold the remove button to free yourself from bear traps.
[8957.68s -> 8961.44s]  Hiding under beds or in wardrobes. You have five days. It's a long time. Use headphones.
[8961.44s -> 8972.69s]  My best experience. I don't, I can't do that. So how many actions do we have for chat right now?
[8973.25s -> 8997.12s]  Do I, is it, is it, is it like a gyro? Oh wow. This is so scary. What's the goal here?
[8997.68s -> 9002.78s]  Do I just have to stay away from granny? Why are there spikes in this? Wait, if I go in here,
[9002.78s -> 9012.88s]  is this going to kill me? Is this an iron maiden? Oh, you can crouch too. All right. So what do I
[9012.88s -> 9018.32s]  do? This is granny chapter two, by the way. If you don't know, this is the number one downloaded
[9018.32s -> 9026.05s]  game on the whole app store. I don't know why granny is just number one on the, it's just,
[9026.05s -> 9039.68s]  there's like 700,000 reviews for this game as well. Wait a minute. Can I open this? I just spit on
[9039.68s -> 9045.12s]  this, but I've had slime up my nose for the last like 40 minutes. So does it really matter?
[9045.44s -> 9065.44s]  Oh, I spit it. Where the hell am I? What? Is the slime yummy? Is that what you're asking?
[9066.75s -> 9076.82s]  Uh, not particularly. It just, it's, it just smells like, like baby formula. Is it actually
[9076.82s -> 9086.42s]  edible? I think it is, right? No. I, what'd I just do that for? No, I can't touch this.
[9088.88s -> 9097.34s]  Is the slime yummy? Is that a trick question? It might be. So now I know. Don't put the slime
[9097.34s -> 9103.42s]  in your mouth. That's one of the, I know one of the actions now. I got a man on the inside.
[9103.42s -> 9111.76s]  The shower tonight that I take is going to be the best shower I've taken in my whole life. All
[9111.76s -> 9121.09s]  right. What am I supposed to do? No, I haven't gotten any in the mouth because it went back.
[9121.65s -> 9129.06s]  I've only been slimed twice. I've been slimed two times. I think I'm good. And one of them was
[9129.06s -> 9138.32s]  bullshit because I had to point to my head twice. So I need a key in granny's house. Oh, this game.
[9138.96s -> 9142.64s]  Wait, I can't see. Can I talk shit about like the most popular game in the app store?
[9142.64s -> 9150.08s]  I probably can't, right? Like, can I say like granny sucks? I can't. That, that there's like
[9150.08s -> 9157.10s]  800,000 people that disagree with me. So I'm wrong, right? I don't even know where I'm supposed to be
[9157.10s -> 9174.64s]  going. Back upstairs? And what did, what killed me the first time? Can I turn the brightness up on
[9174.64s -> 9182.34s]  the iPad? All right. I, I, I'm going to put, I'm going to turn the brightness up. It's pretty low.
[9182.34s -> 9190.96s]  I can't see that. All right. Now I can see it was so, it was really low. Now I can see. All right.
[9190.96s -> 9198.43s]  We're good. Now I think it was so dark. All right. I'm upstairs. Okay. There's there. I am assuming
[9198.43s -> 9217.70s]  that was granny. There was just people in granny's house. What does he know? Like how do I peel?
[9218.85s -> 9227.66s]  How do you feel? How do you feel? It looks like, Oh, I'm going to peel. Sure. No, don't click the
[9227.66s -> 9239.14s]  ad. Don't click the ad. Don't click the ad. All right. Well, it's time for me to peel, I guess.
[9239.14s -> 9249.58s]  Let's go choose my peeler. I think that's a good one up here. Nope. Nope. No, no, no, no, no.
[9249.58s -> 9256.22s]  I'm not going to do that. I'm stuck to the ground. When I stand up, we're carving a pumpkin soon.
[9256.22s -> 9265.55s]  Oh, that might be a slippery action. That may be, don't say it. He's doing a pumpkin carving.
[9269.76s -> 9277.33s]  No, I can't, but we're doing a pumpkin carving after that, after this. So there's more to see.
[9278.43s -> 9283.94s]  I, I think I'm done playing granny. So I am going to move on to the next one because granny is pretty,
[9283.94s -> 9288.58s]  it's just, it's just granny and the other person in the house and they attack you.
[9289.86s -> 9296.99s]  Okay. Good old iPad horror games that I don't know how to accomplish anything in them.
[9296.99s -> 9300.67s]  I also don't have audio, so that's another thing you guys maybe not, maybe might not know.
[9301.47s -> 9306.66s]  You guys might not know that. I guess I can sneak. I'll try one more time.
[9306.66s -> 9311.70s]  Well, that's the death room. I probably have like, hold on, let me fix my nerd neck.
[9311.70s -> 9318.58s]  I don't want to have like nerd neck, but how do you, okay. I'm dead again. All right. So granny is
[9318.58s -> 9332.77s]  a fun game and she's a wonderful, wonderful person. This five, should I just do all five days? I'm
[9332.77s -> 9338.66s]  going to go to the next game because this is just stupid. All right. Round over or are we still
[9338.66s -> 9349.30s]  going to stay with whatever we have here? Keep it up for a little bit on here. Oh, cause this,
[9349.30s -> 9357.70s]  cause this game sucks. All right. New game. Uh, how about, how about scary butcher 3d,
[9357.70s -> 9368.02s]  new actions, new game. All right. How about scary butcher 3d? That one looks pretty good play.
[9368.26s -> 9371.34s]  Chad says that you violated one.
[9371.34s -> 9378.03s]  What do you mean I violated one? What do you mean I, what do you mean I violated one?
[9378.03s -> 9388.62s]  People saying rigged. What do you, what do you mean cheated rigged? What are you talking about?
[9388.62s -> 9412.53s]  What? Well, you can't just like retroactively add a slime because you, we didn't do it. I just like
[9412.53s -> 9419.39s]  backed up. I was like, okay, I guess I'll put that. So what, what do you mean hand motions?
[9425.73s -> 9442.26s]  So what? Okay. All right. Well, I, I'm just going to say, I have to, okay, I have an idea.
[9442.26s -> 9453.62s]  I have to keep my fucking hands down. So in the small town of Erie, they lived a butcher
[9453.62s -> 9458.34s]  bee with his wife. One stormy night, Elena got, I'm stuck to the back of the chair. I'm stuck to the
[9458.34s -> 9465.74s]  back of the chair. Can you see this? I'm at, I'm actually stuck to the back of the chair. Who cares
[9465.74s -> 9471.04s]  about the butcher's life? Since then, he cooks all kinds of sausages. Who gives a shit about
[9471.04s -> 9483.66s]  the butcher? I'm stuck to the chair. Since then, his pets keep vanishing all around. I can hear it
[9483.66s -> 9490.54s]  being refilled and it's seriously causing me a lot of anxiety. Since then, the pets keep vanishing
[9490.54s -> 9494.38s]  all around town. Some believe it's the butcher who captures and eats the pets. This guy's fucking
[9494.38s -> 9508.67s]  crazy. Okay. You know, when you watch a cartoon and there's always that like weird part of the
[9508.67s -> 9513.95s]  cartoon where, or no, you know, I'll put it this way. Um, men in black, right? I got, and like in
[9513.95s -> 9518.37s]  every men in black movie, I've been eaten by the alien and then spit out, you know, like,
[9520.45s -> 9526.45s]  what the fuck? I'm the guy that got eaten and spit out by the alien. I think I'm doing pretty
[9526.45s -> 9540.77s]  well. Okay. I'm the person that gets regurgitated. Okay. Let's continue. Your cat fuzzball went
[9540.77s -> 9545.97s]  missing yesterday. Could be captured by bee. The butcher's hill is heavily protected by alarms.
[9545.97s -> 9559.34s]  So you have to be careful. This person stole my cat. Press button to throw the stone. Hold follow
[9559.34s -> 9563.02s]  arrows to reach destination. When we throw the stone, why did I do that? What was the point of
[9563.02s -> 9576.50s]  that? Keep your fucking hands down here. No, no, like download now promotion. Well done. Level
[9576.50s -> 9582.56s]  completed. Walked in a straight line. It was a close call and I'm still going to compute. Okay.
[9582.56s -> 9595.02s]  It's good that you managed to hide or you could be his next victim. Breaking to beat. Then that
[9595.02s -> 9606.69s]  game look fun. Right. Cool. No, don't watch the whole ad. I can't even click the X. Okay.
[9606.69s -> 9616.26s]  Stop opening the fucking app store. Okay. Breaking to be shed and steal his night vision goggles.
[9616.26s -> 9640.08s]  Use this button to toggle display. That's him in the corner. Can he not see me? Oh, there he is.
[9640.08s -> 9646.67s]  Look out. Oh no. He got you. And he just goes like, he just like dances. Oops. Butcher caught you
[9646.67s -> 9655.65s]  red handed restart. Here's that shooter game. You know, I can't, this is that shooter game for you
[9655.65s -> 9672.70s]  kids. I can't hit the X. We just have to let it play out. Oh no, no, no. It's like opening,
[9672.70s -> 9676.58s]  like to actually opening the app store. We have to move on. All right. We're going to do
[9676.58s -> 9687.07s]  horror clones. Are we on a new round? Same round. New round. Okay. Uh, the iPad is upside down
[9687.07s -> 9694.90s]  because the game crashed. So we're going to pick a different one. How about evil nun? Evil nun? Uh,
[9694.90s -> 9713.17s]  evil nun might also be broken too. Evil nun doesn't work. How about, uh, Emily? How about Emily? Do
[9713.17s -> 9722.69s]  you work, Emily? We'll find out. Emily wants to play a new game. Holy shit, it actually works.
[9722.69s -> 9731.10s]  And what are we going to get into the ad? Oh, of course we are. Here it comes. No, this is actually
[9731.10s -> 9759.22s]  has a cut scene. Oof. Uh, did you see that? This is, I have, okay, this has been fucking stupid.
[9759.22s -> 9770.48s]  The iPad segment was a bust. Interact. Although I still have, what was chat's word? What does chat
[9771.04s -> 9792.96s]  have for a word last time? Ass. Okay. Well, sorry to hear that you guys lost so many points.
[9792.96s -> 9810.08s]  Why was it ass? Ooh, hold on. What's on the computer? What's on the computer? Let's get a zoom in.
[9812.75s -> 9825.73s]  Thanks for what? Thanks for ordering. I don't know what I ordered. Thanks a lot. Okay. Uh,
[9825.73s -> 9839.18s]  can I go on? Oh, that's a hint. Wait, I can just turn the lights off in the whole house?
[9841.47s -> 9851.58s]  Oh, let's play at midnight says one guy. Sure. I'll try. All right. This game sucks too. I'm going
[9851.58s -> 9863.47s]  to just carve the pumpkin. This game sucks. No, it doesn't. That's not fair. That's not fair.
[9863.47s -> 9873.46s]  That's not fair. Let me give it like another 30 seconds. Look, tap center to interact with objects.
[9874.02s -> 9880.85s]  This game actually is for an iPad game is pretty good. Let me turn the lights back on. Hold on.
[9880.85s -> 9892.29s]  Can I leave the house? The slime has caked underneath my head. I want to so badly take
[9892.29s -> 9901.12s]  this off, but I can't because if it happens again, then it, this is real life. I want you to get this
[9901.12s -> 9912.67s]  like, look at this. This is, it's like glued to my forehead. If I take this off and I get slimed
[9912.67s -> 9930.69s]  again, I will be very upset. I ain't taking the bald cap off. Does anybody know anything about
[9930.69s -> 9940.83s]  these games? I just heard dump it. And why are we dumping it? I'm not going to, don't look up into
[9940.83s -> 9949.73s]  it. What do you mean? I'm going to get in my eyes. Close your eyes. Holy shit. This is disgusting.
[9950.59s -> 9964.08s]  You put extra in this one. Okay. Oh my God. That's, that is, this is vile. I'm trying to be,
[9964.08s -> 9985.86s]  I'm trying to be normal about this. It smells, it smells like acid. What smells like, but
[9986.26s -> 9994.22s]  over exaggerated detail. That's not, that's a real life. That's an over-exaggerating.
[9998.86s -> 10007.06s]  No, there's no glue in this. It's just eco-friendly slime. Oh my God. I just saw.
[10009.44s -> 10014.40s]  Hey, remember I met in black when the guy gets like fucking puked up. The guy pukes and he's like,
[10014.40s -> 10023.55s]  it's me. What's that? Don't do it. Move. Mom, if you're watching, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mom.
[10023.55s -> 10034.82s]  I really don't mean to be like this. I have to take this off. Where's the pumpkin? I still have
[10034.82s -> 10291.34s]  the diaper on. Nice watch. Hi, welcome back. Welcome. Right now, we're going to do a thing.
[10292.14s -> 10296.43s]  We're going to do a thing where I carve a pumpkin. By the way, the diaper has to stay on
[10297.23s -> 10302.83s]  because if the diaper comes off, the pants do too, because they're way down to a point where I,
[10303.31s -> 10309.23s]  I have to keep them on. Let me get rid. I have like, okay, this is, I'm making it worse.
[10311.33s -> 10318.32s]  So as you see here, we have a regular size pumpkin. I'm going to draw a stencil on him.
[10321.22s -> 10333.54s]  I look really bad. Really bad. In fact, like, so as we see here, I've, I don't, I don't know shit
[10333.54s -> 10337.78s]  about carving pumpkin. I'm realizing this right now. Oh, what do we want to do to like do the,
[10337.78s -> 10343.42s]  what's, how do you want to end this, this like show? I'll carve a pumpkin. Okay. I don't know
[10343.42s -> 10350.59s]  how the fuck to do that. So where, what are you doing? What are you doing? What'd I do?
[10351.31s -> 10358.99s]  I swear, did I say the word pumpkin? The word pumpkin. You're going to set me up with a segment
[10358.99s -> 10364.48s]  where I get a pumpkin and I say the word pumpkin and that's a problem. So that's not fair.
[10364.48s -> 10390.69s]  How's that fair? Okay. I can't just, the pumpkin is gone. I can say the word pumpkin now. Okay.
[10392.66s -> 10400.82s]  So I'm going to draw a stencil here. Can you see that? That's my stencil. Okay.
[10405.17s -> 10411.01s]  Okay. There are knives of now around. There are knives. I'm going to move the knives over here
[10411.01s -> 10429.01s]  because these are knives. Okay. So, you know, why don't I just punch it? Okay. You guys have no
[10429.01s -> 10433.81s]  fuck. This is like a challenge on a game show, which is pretty much what this is.
[10434.61s -> 10441.65s]  I'm going to have to get up with my hands because there's fucking slime everywhere here.
[10441.65s -> 10461.41s]  So why would you give somebody a knife when they're standing on ice? This is a challenge.
[10465.60s -> 10500.26s]  I can't get in with my nails. Okay. That's unsafe. It's unsafe. All right. We got a vacuum.
[10521.68s -> 10530.77s]  That's not, that's not a risk. Okay. The word is not vacuum. I just don't want to be harmed on
[10530.77s -> 10540.34s]  spring. That's not the word. Is it the word? No, it's actually not vacuum. That's too bad.
[10541.06s -> 10589.98s]  Oh, that's better. That's better. Okay. Anybody want a pumpkin? It's not that I've never carved
[10589.98s -> 10597.42s]  a pumpkin. I just don't want to. Hold on. All right. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to make
[10597.98s -> 10607.39s]  let's go like this. Wait a minute. The hammer, the hammer with the hammer. Where's the hammer?
[10607.39s -> 10613.34s]  The hammer with the like, literally nobody on production knows what I'm trying to say.
[10613.34s -> 10623.22s]  The hammer with the little nails that light up. The chisel. I can do that.
[10635.86s -> 10641.12s]  Scary. All right. That this works. No, I don't have to worry about it. I'm going to make a,
[10641.12s -> 10653.02s]  I'm going to make a face. Is it a real pumpkin? What do you mean is this a real pumpkin?
[10653.02s -> 10662.29s]  Like this is a real pumpkin. Look at the stem. I can see. Oh, I just have to squint real hard,
[10662.29s -> 10669.92s]  but I can see what you said. This frame's pre-recorded. Oh, is it? Would it be
[10669.92s -> 10679.62s]  pre-recorded if I went like this? It's a fake stream. Just wait a minute. Let me just get this
[10679.62s -> 10685.94s]  because I know what your, I know what your, where's the, there it is. Oh, let me go.
[10685.94s -> 10698.26s]  Doctor, how am I doing? Oh, I'm doing just fine. All right. That works.
[10701.86s -> 10726.32s]  I'm going to hit my fucking hand with this. That, okay. We're getting there. I can't even
[10726.32s -> 10735.01s]  pick it up. Okay. What about, hold on like this. I am making something. The face I'm going to make
[10735.81s -> 10744.50s]  is going to be a very special guest. You might find this thing at the circus. You might find
[10744.50s -> 10755.57s]  this thing at a birthday party. Ow. I need like red. I need like purple. We actually had one of
[10755.57s -> 10767.49s]  these on stream. Uh, actually two of them. So that was red. I can't even get in there. Okay.
[10767.49s -> 10771.89s]  That looks fucking terrible. It looks like somebody just put three pegs into a pumpkin.
[10771.89s -> 10792.42s]  We're getting there. Great. I can't, I've done this first. You got to get it in like, there we go.
[10792.42s -> 10798.27s]  You know, don't even, why am I even hitting it like this? Just press it in. I'm using it like
[10798.27s -> 10803.07s]  it's an actual mallet. This thing weighs like four, like maybe four ounces. My pants aren't
[10803.07s -> 10808.74s]  falling down, right? Okay. That's just the diaper. I thought that was my underwear. I actually thought
[10808.74s -> 10842.67s]  that was my actual underwear. This is Jeremy gets hurt on stream. Don't try this at home. It
[10842.67s -> 10852.11s]  ain't going in there. It's going to have to go somewhere else. We should have just had somebody
[10852.11s -> 10860.75s]  make one. We should have had somebody make one of these. Hey, can somebody carve a cool pumpkin?
[10861.71s -> 10871.57s]  I'm not, I'm, I just, I'm not going to do that. Let's do it with my hands. It's way easier.
[10872.61s -> 10888.05s]  Fuck off. Can these be eyes? No, there's no red. Guys, I'm having trouble. What's that thing?
[10888.61s -> 10894.72s]  You have no idea how to do this? No, I do. It's, it's with knife. It's with knives.
[10896.06s -> 10902.38s]  And I'm, I am no, I, I am slippery. I am that's like my superpower right now. You want the slippery
[10902.38s -> 10925.79s]  guy to hold the knife? What? That actually felt pretty good. Hold up more than three fingers.
[10926.59s -> 10935.47s]  Have I, how have I not done that before? He's not reacting. Don't, he's bad. React. React harder.
[10935.47s -> 10945.65s]  React harder. Halloween. No, I, oh, for saying clown, you guys lose points. That's the end of
[10945.65s -> 10953.34s]  the round. You said clown. He didn't react. No, cause at some point it just becomes like numb.
[10953.34s -> 10956.46s]  You know what I mean? At some point, like I, it's happened so many times. It's like, okay,
[10956.46s -> 10964.59s]  I guess it's happening again. You guys said clown. What the fuck am I even doing this? What? This is
[10964.59s -> 10970.03s]  like a, okay, this is like a map to where you've been. You know, you have this shit in like your
[10970.03s -> 10974.83s]  living room to make like your friends jealous. Oh, I've been to Canada. I've been to Toronto.
[10974.83s -> 10980.75s]  And then I, I've been over here, up here into the great lakes down here. Oh yeah. I love Oklahoma.
[10980.75s -> 10994.86s]  Are you doing it again? Oh, I was like, what the fuck? Um, how do I get in this? Can this be taken
[10994.86s -> 11001.86s]  off? This is like bad, right? Can I like pull this off? Audio and video are now out of sync,
[11001.86s -> 11011.98s]  apparently. Why, why is that? He doesn't know. He didn't react. What? I mean, how does he not know?
[11011.98s -> 11025.02s]  What are you talking about? What? What did I not do? We have to get their points down by the way.
[11025.02s -> 11035.70s]  I, I, okay. Lightning round put up 15 actions for me and like 10 actions for chat. Don't tell him.
[11035.70s -> 11041.02s]  Hollow out the pumpkin. We didn't do that beforehand. Oh, we ran out of time. I don't
[11041.10s -> 11059.18s]  know. I seriously might as well just like go like this action. You can fuck off. Oh, look at me.
[11060.50s -> 11064.10s]  Get it all out of the way before anybody has any actions. There's no battery in here.
[11067.47s -> 11073.49s]  Oh, can I just draw on it? What's our, what's it? Feed it into my ear. What's our actions?
[11073.49s -> 11090.05s]  Hold on. I can't, I used to have to go to my diaper. Hold on. What is it? Say it softly. I will,
[11090.05s -> 11115.25s]  I will win this if you give it to me. Give me their actions. Okay. Guys are fucked. Although I have,
[11115.25s -> 11125.84s]  how many do I have? I'll have eight. Okay. Um, that's solidified enough where I can,
[11125.84s -> 11131.28s]  no, I can, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going, okay. I, people might go, oh, come on.
[11131.28s -> 11135.68s]  You're not going to carve the pumpkin. I'm not going to be the guy on Twitch that has the knife
[11135.68s -> 11147.73s]  in his hand and is like, not going to happen. It's, I'm not doing that. Does that violate TOS?
[11147.81s -> 11157.98s]  Oh, I, oh yeah. Violates my life. It went right down my ass crack right now. Just went in,
[11157.98s -> 11162.54s]  it went all the way. It didn't, it's, it's just right now for the first time. The diaper has been
[11162.54s -> 11171.90s]  breached. Uh, so I'm going to draw on this. We'll spin it around. I'm serious. Just spray me with
[11171.90s -> 11177.68s]  the hose back. Like I was back. This is not, this is not a joke. This is actual, like spray me all
[11177.68s -> 11186.02s]  of my whole body with the hose. So this is, this marker is dead. We're just going to look at the
[11186.02s -> 11194.16s]  pumpkin. Might as well just play like funny videos. Might as well. Oh, I have new actions?
[11195.47s -> 11209.42s]  Okay. Chat sees them. Can the pumpkin have, we did the computer. Can we have the pumpkin actions?
[11212.06s -> 11221.50s]  What do I have to do here? Get off of that. We're almost at the end of the show. If you guys are
[11221.50s -> 11226.62s]  curious. Should I try running again? This is a treadmill. Ready? Remember that? How's my
[11226.62s -> 11241.10s]  nerd neck? All right. Move the knives. Ready? Don't run this way. Run this way. But then what
[11241.10s -> 11254.83s]  if I like, all right, this is, this looks fucking bad. I look like I'm like soaking my, oh darling,
[11254.83s -> 11266.91s]  please help me. All right. Not bad. I can get it one more time. That was a false ride. That was a
[11266.91s -> 11280.74s]  false ride. I think I got some on the camera. This is what we like to call, this boy is out of material
[11280.74s -> 11290.08s]  and he can't get into the pumpkin. So he's been, he's at the point where he's got nothing left
[11290.08s -> 11301.10s]  to do. Dropping him. No, I'm not going to drop it. This thing weighs like 200 pounds. What if I just
[11301.10s -> 11306.61s]  like shot foot it over at production? Drop it. I'm not going to smash this. You know, that's
[11306.61s -> 11313.71s]  bullshit. Just do Gallagher. This is Gallagher. You're watching Gallagher right now. Let me tell
[11313.79s -> 11340.82s]  you something. What? What? Funny voice. Hey, so what we do here now that a funny voice is done,
[11342.34s -> 11352.38s]  we just do funny voices for the rest of the stream. This is not a good diaper. It's actually
[11352.38s -> 11360.18s]  pretty good. And by the way, it's over the top half of, it's, it's over of my clothes. Put the
[11360.18s -> 11375.17s]  diaper on the pumpkin. Give me a diaper. This is like 20 in that case. Do a back flip. I might
[11375.17s -> 11381.33s]  need three. Should I just wear them? Should I just put these on? Okay, let's test it. Dump it. Oh,
[11381.33s -> 11387.17s]  he did a thing. He did something fucking weird. Into the diaper. Let's test the diaper. Dump it.
[11387.17s -> 11408.24s]  Let's see how good these are. You guys talked a lot of shit. Nothing got through at the bottom.
[11408.24s -> 11417.82s]  Look at that. Pretty good actually. This is what I'm doing right now. We're testing diapers. That
[11417.82s -> 11425.26s]  means I'm out of content. I just, like that image is now forever on, on camera.
[11426.96s -> 11437.42s]  Is dumping slime into a, into a diaper to test it. Shit. Put it on the pumpkin.
[11437.42s -> 11444.54s]  Okay. I'll take that. That's a bad idea. Why, why is that bad?
[11449.60s -> 11460.11s]  Diapers are going to protect me. This thing can hold like five gallons. That's bad advice.
[11460.43s -> 11474.99s]  It's kind of good advice. That's disgusting. It just, can we get the vac back here, please?
[11475.71s -> 11490.16s]  That was nothing in there. I don't like that sound. Can I see that for a sec? You'll see it
[11490.16s -> 11509.68s]  for just a sec. Up here. If you could. There you go. Thank you. Thanks a lot. It's like up my nose.
[11514.82s -> 11522.72s]  There's no point for this to even be here anymore. There's no reason for this pumpkin.
[11524.08s -> 11537.84s]  We can wash this pumpkin off. All right. I'm going to try to get into the pumpkin.
[11537.84s -> 11550.62s]  Very gently. I just want to get in. Carve it. What is all over this? I thought that was blood.
[11551.34s -> 11557.20s]  I was like, what the fuck is that? Behind you? Yeah, I know.
[11559.02s -> 11576.26s]  I can hear them. No, not the top rope. We're going to get like frog splashed. Okay. I just
[11576.26s -> 11582.32s]  got to get in. If I can get in and we can see what's in there. It's like a science experiment.
[11585.12s -> 11588.72s]  I'm being extraordinarily careful. The most careful I've ever been in my whole life is right
[11588.72s -> 11608.38s]  now. All right. I'm almost in. Okay. I'm in. Okay. I'm in. This is bait. It's not bait.
[11612.48s -> 11615.28s]  You know, when you do some things and you go, you know what? I probably should just like go
[11615.28s -> 11627.17s]  to church tomorrow. That's like, that's kind of what's in my mind at the moment. Like I don't,
[11627.17s -> 11630.93s]  I didn't do anything wrong, but I really just feel like I should go to church.
[11634.34s -> 11644.22s]  I can't get in here. This pumpkin is thick. What we got for a time? We got another five minutes.
[11644.94s -> 11654.48s]  You want to putt his chat? Okay. What was the words for chat?
[11655.36s -> 11684.43s]  Ooh, woo. Comcast. Wait, the word was streamer. Omega lull. Wow. And P. How many points did they
[11684.43s -> 11699.65s]  lose? 1700, which puts them way ahead of me still. P. Streamer P. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[11701.86s -> 11706.83s]  When we thought about this, like two or three weeks ago, it was, it was a great idea.
[11707.47s -> 11715.92s]  I don't know if you guys heard that, but the people at production said nobody said that.
[11721.52s -> 11728.05s]  Oh, but we got like, I like this. I actually like this costume. Be this for Halloween next year,
[11729.14s -> 11732.18s]  except don't put the diaper on. People will think you're something's wrong. You know,
[11732.18s -> 11734.90s]  if you have like a diaper on over your clothes, actually Doug does that.
[11738.05s -> 11741.89s]  All right. Uh, we, we should probably close it out here. Maybe one more round and that's it.
[11743.17s -> 11748.85s]  Put the rest of the actions on the screen. Yeah. Put every action at the rest of every single action
[11748.85s -> 11757.46s]  that's available on the screen for me right now. Okay. I am going to literally just stare into the
[11757.46s -> 11766.45s]  camera. What am I going to do with pumpkin? Um, I don't know, wipe it down and, and clean it and
[11766.45s -> 11777.46s]  give it to my mother. No, I'm not going to throw the pumpkin. Like what is going on here?
[11778.34s -> 11796.35s]  Oh, it's like dirt. Oh, it's actually really dirty. I wait, I, you guys have time. Okay.
[11797.07s -> 11801.49s]  How are you guys doing tonight? You guys having a good Halloween? Did you have a good Halloween?
[11803.66s -> 11817.71s]  There's new actions on screen. Okay. How many? A lot. There are more than two dozen. Okay.
[11826.96s -> 11853.47s]  A pose. That's not, let's try to get the whole hat orange. I feel like I'm like that first grade.
[11853.47s -> 11862.64s]  I'm just like, Oh, this is fun. Oh, that looks really good. What you're doing there. Oh,
[11863.52s -> 11874.40s]  Johnny, that's really nice. Yes, it is. Oh, wow. What is it? What'd you make up? What is it? What
[11874.40s -> 11884.67s]  is that a pic? What is that? What is that of? Oh, it's a face. It looks fan. It looks so good.
[11884.67s -> 11890.21s]  Wow. I can't wait to tell you mother about it. Thank you. Like what the fuck am I doing? I'm
[11890.21s -> 11897.01s]  just standing here rubbing a pumpkin. I've been rubbing a pumpkin. This is the stream content
[11897.01s -> 11906.27s]  you've received in the last like 30, 40 minutes is rubbing a pumpkin with oil. Is it, it's what
[11906.35s -> 11912.82s]  is chat's fault. That's true. You guys did come up with these actions. They're pretty good.
[11916.08s -> 11937.26s]  All right. So how I've only done one in like two dozen actions. Really? Okay. Wait, that actually
[11937.26s -> 11940.38s]  might be an action. I'm not going to, I'm going to do something. Okay. I have to decide. I have to
[11940.38s -> 11949.31s]  continuously move, but not do anything. This thing is heavy enough where I can hold.
[11949.79s -> 11957.31s]  I'm like fucking Jim Carrey from dumb and dumber. Jim Carrey with the suit on.
[11959.57s -> 11972.29s]  I'm not losing points for this. Am I? I should be. What about chat? Does chat have a thousand
[11972.29s -> 11980.37s]  things to do? It's a shitty Freddy Krueger. This is Freddy. It's Splatoon Freddy Krueger.
[11980.93s -> 11986.29s]  Oh, oh, oh. I would be right now. Right now. I would be, I would be gagging right now. I would
[11986.29s -> 11997.87s]  be going, but I'm not going to freak out. I'm going to be everyone. I'm going to use a diaper.
[11997.87s -> 12003.31s]  Okay. Because that was horrible. You know, when something hits you on the lip and it's something
[12003.31s -> 12008.05s]  that you really don't want to have in your mouth, that just happened. And I almost had that immediate
[12008.05s -> 12016.00s]  reaction. It was immediate, but I slowed down and I wiped it off with a diaper. So thanks for watching
[12016.00s -> 12023.76s]  everybody. Really appreciate everybody coming out and hanging out here. That was a lot of fun. Hey,
[12023.76s -> 12030.59s]  how about that? Dr. Schmikeson comes and says, hello. That was a treat. Glad to have Dr. Schmikeson
[12030.59s -> 12043.63s]  back. Did pretty good. Trevi was fun. We got Bugleberry. That was fun. But I like, seriously,
[12044.19s -> 12051.06s]  this is getting like to a point where it's too gross. So I like, do I have something I can like
[12051.06s -> 12056.80s]  spit into? Do I have something I can spit into? I know that sounds disgusting, but it's been like
[12056.80s -> 12062.08s]  in the back of my throat for like at least 20 minutes and I need to spit. Do we have anything
[12062.08s -> 12072.64s]  to spit? We do. Okay. Where is it? I need like a cup or a glass or something. Not on
[12072.64s -> 12083.62s]  the, no, no, no, no, not on the floor. There's something over here. I can spit it. Doesn't matter.
[12090.21s -> 12098.45s]  Oh, oh, holy. Whoa. Oh, that's, oh, what the fuck was in here?
[12107.71s -> 12121.52s]  What the fuck is going on? Hey, no, no, no, no, no.
