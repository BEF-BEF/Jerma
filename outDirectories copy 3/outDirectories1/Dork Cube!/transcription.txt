[1.27s -> 6.38s]  Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with something a little different today.
[6.38s -> 12.84s]  This is not my typical video that I would make, but I decided to do it because I got
[12.84s -> 17.32s]  approached by this company. They're a super cool bunch of guys over at DorkCube and it is
[17.96s -> 23.18s]  the DorkCube. Take a look at it. This is a monthly subscription box that comes in the mail
[23.18s -> 29.90s]  and you buy it, you open it, and there's all kinds of nerdy, geeky, epic, kind of funny
[29.98s -> 35.50s]  gamer culture type stuff inside and I thought I should get one and you should open it for you
[35.50s -> 39.58s]  and you know give these guys a shout. Give these guys a shout out and give you guys a shout out
[39.58s -> 44.47s]  and we'll give them a shout out. This is DorkCube. I don't know what's inside of it. I have no idea.
[44.47s -> 48.95s]  They sent it to me so we're going to see what's inside. A link will be in the description.
[49.75s -> 56.07s]  If you want 2% off your next order, it's $20. So save a little bit of cash, you know, save you guys
[56.07s -> 60.74s]  looking out for you guys. You know what I mean? All right, you know, let's make this let's make
[60.74s -> 65.48s]  this a little interesting. How about that? Right when the box opens, how about everybody writes
[65.48s -> 70.68s]  hashtag in the comments, LOOTGAP. You know what I mean? Like we got loot, you know, that's what
[70.68s -> 76.36s]  we'll do. So in the comments section below, right when this opens, everybody say LOOTGAP!
