[0.12s -> 77.27s]  Hello, how are you? How is everybody doing today? Today I think I'm going to be
[77.27s -> 97.24s]  playing some Nancy Drew and also Diablo 4. How you doing good? Starting off strong
[97.24s -> 101.42s]  on this one. Starting off strong. No, I'm gonna slow it down a little bit today.
[101.42s -> 116.32s]  There was a TikTok voiceover. No, go full speed. How many stream points do I have?
[116.96s -> 127.57s]  Stream points? Like channel points on my own channel? Do I even get them? Introducing
[127.57s -> 131.21s]  channel points. Watch German 985 earn channel points. Unlock rewards. I haven't
[131.21s -> 135.49s]  even clicked the button to begin accruing points. So I guess the answer is
[135.49s -> 153.56s]  zero. Wouldn't I be... Oh yeah, me getting my own currency created
[153.56s -> 158.83s]  from my own channel from me? I feel like that's contributing to... I don't... No, I
[158.83s -> 161.55s]  don't want to do that. I would want to make sure... I would want to take away
[161.55s -> 173.76s]  from myself from having that many points. Fake fan. Some kind of currency thing.
[173.76s -> 180.50s]  Dude, just click it. I don't want to click get it get started. I don't want...
[180.50s -> 185.54s]  When I click... If you click get started that just to me tells the computer like
[185.54s -> 190.82s]  alright I'm ready to do this now and I don't even want to do it. You know what I mean?
[190.82s -> 194.50s]  I don't want to click get started because I want to finish it the second
[194.58s -> 207.74s]  I click get started. Like the title? I mean it's true. Scared of commitment. I'm
[207.74s -> 211.10s]  scared of committing to things that I don't necessarily really care that much
[211.10s -> 219.34s]  about. I understand. I said steam points. God damn it. Why does this happen to me
[219.34s -> 243.33s]  every day? Your balance on steam. I don't know. I don't... I don't know. 200. There you go.
[243.33s -> 266.77s]  This is my balance. 200. A lot. 200 points. That's a shitload. No, not your steam wallet
[266.77s -> 277.41s]  balance. That's not accurate. I'm just made up a number. I feel like that that would be kind of
[277.41s -> 284.19s]  a lot of money to have in a steam wallet. Wouldn't it? Like 200 plus dollars? Maybe not. It's
[284.19s -> 295.78s]  depending on how many games you plan on buying. But anyways let's talk about what's happening.
[296.34s -> 303.98s]  Okay. Let's talk. Today we're going to be finishing our Nancy Drew homework.
[306.18s -> 313.38s]  I feel like the Diablo 4 server is... I played it... I have to confess. I played it a lot last night.
[314.18s -> 322.61s]  Ollie and I played it a lot. I made another character and I just kind of... kind of went...
[322.61s -> 336.90s]  we kind of went nuts without us. Yeah. I did. I did. But I can tell you that
[337.70s -> 351.65s]  I enjoy it. I think it's fun to play. And I'm hoping that the game is searching to how to stay
[351.65s -> 357.01s]  fair. It's searching. They're trying to come up with a way to say be fair about it but also not
[357.01s -> 361.25s]  too involved. Don't let them think that you care that much. That's what's screaming through my
[361.25s -> 369.73s]  brain right now. So what I want to tell you is I want to play as the Necromancer. That'll be the
[369.73s -> 384.83s]  way that I really tell if I'm going to play it or not. But I do like... I like it so far. I don't
[384.83s -> 389.07s]  know how deep the skill system is really going to go. I don't know how deep the itemization is going
[389.07s -> 405.22s]  to be. But if Necromancer is fun, I will probably be playing it. That's it. That's it. But today is
[405.22s -> 409.94s]  the last day that it can be played for this week. So the plan is to do Nancy Drew for a little while.
[410.58s -> 414.34s]  Maybe get to the end of that. Maybe get however far enough the end of there that I want to,
[414.34s -> 422.16s]  you know, play it. And then move on to D4 for the rest of the night. Just chill because I think it's
[422.16s -> 431.74s]  turning off at midnight. Is it tomorrow at midnight or is it tonight at midnight? Because I still want
[431.74s -> 441.17s]  to play with these sorcerers. 3 p.m. on Monday Eastern. Okay. So there's plenty of time. And then
[442.13s -> 450.11s]  Resident Evil 4, I'm going to play it essentially until I beat it. So that's, I believe... Is that
[450.11s -> 456.11s]  the 23rd at midnight or is that the 24th in the middle of the day? I asked this in pre-stream. I'm
[456.11s -> 460.51s]  curious if anybody knows. Is the Resident Evil 4 remake coming out like in the middle of the day
[460.51s -> 465.65s]  on the 24th or is it going to be like a midnight release on Thursday? I don't think anybody really
[465.65s -> 483.42s]  knows. He didn't even listen to our answer. It's just out when it's out. Yeah. Well, whatever.
[483.66s -> 490.16s]  Whatever it launches on the 24th, that is when I will be getting ready to play it. Apparently,
[490.16s -> 496.32s]  the remake, as of all the reviews I've seen, is stellar. It is getting unbelievable reviews.
[497.28s -> 505.31s]  Some of these outlets are giving it a 10. This is getting tens. So I don't want to say that,
[505.31s -> 512.00s]  like, okay. Am I? I don't want to say it, but I'm going to say it. I gave the Resident Evil 2 remake
[512.00s -> 517.68s]  game of the year when it came out. Is that going to happen again for another Resident Evil remake?
[517.68s -> 526.26s]  It might. We'll see. That's funny, though. Oh, Bat Chest stellar reviews.
[536.99s -> 543.90s]  All right. I am going to open up Nancy Drew. I might not put the camera on. I've been doing
[543.90s -> 548.48s]  no cam and I've been liking it. We'll see. Maybe we'll turn it on a little bit later.
[549.28s -> 561.34s]  We'll go cam camless for now. Don't worry about cam. Yeah, no, I know. I know nobody here is
[561.34s -> 564.94s]  pressured me to put it on. Don't worry. Just last night was kind of like I was feeling it.
[564.94s -> 570.22s]  Let's put it on and just fuck around. It's going to happen a lot. All right. Nancy Drew.
[570.86s -> 576.24s]  Does anyone remember anything that we did? I'll be really honest with you. Not last night. You know,
[576.24s -> 583.10s]  my sense of time is so fucked up. We were going back and forth between Nancy Drew and Diablo that
[583.10s -> 588.61s]  I kind of don't even remember what the hell we even did. Hey, I tried to do the cat puke noise
[588.61s -> 594.13s]  and it just makes me sound like I'm burping. Any tips? I do not recommend anybody attempt that.
[594.13s -> 602.05s]  Don't try that at home. You should not. Don't try this at home. Okay. I need to make I need to put
[602.05s -> 606.93s]  like a huge disclaimer up somewhere on the stream that just don't ever try anything or say anything
[606.93s -> 610.69s]  I say ever. Don't ever do any of this and don't watch and don't comment. Don't subscribe. Don't
[610.69s -> 615.09s]  be here. I should probably put that up, right? Don't ever say anything that I say. Don't ever
[615.09s -> 617.73s]  do anything that I've done. Don't ever attempt anything I've done. Don't ever watch. Don't
[617.73s -> 621.81s]  subscribe. Don't donate or anything. You know what I mean? Just probably like a disclaimer.
[624.74s -> 631.28s]  That would be such a fucked up disclaimer. All right. Don't watch. Just put it at the bottom
[631.28s -> 640.75s]  of the screen. Hold on. I got to think of like a huge paragraph though. I should have thought
[640.75s -> 647.33s]  about this like an hour ago. No, I'll do it another day. All right. Nancy Drew, what do you got?
[647.33s -> 660.06s]  Hopefully it's not too loud. How's the audios? All right. Don't attempt anything you see. Yeah,
[660.06s -> 664.48s]  but people that are coming in and seeing that pinned are going to think I'm about to like
[664.48s -> 668.72s]  backflip off of a building or something, right? Like that that you get that warning before
[668.72s -> 672.88s]  something crazy is about to happen and they're going to be really disappointed when it's just
[672.88s -> 680.34s]  Nancy Drew. I'm not going to do anything. That's a warning to me. To me that is something dangerous
[680.34s -> 683.78s]  is going to happen at some point. He's going to turn his cam on. He's going to get like attacked
[683.78s -> 697.28s]  by a bear or something. All right. Anyways, what I need to focus. We fished. We put the line in.
[697.28s -> 704.22s]  We did the fishing mini game. I couldn't keep one, right? I snagged a log. There goes my line.
[704.22s -> 713.09s]  Can you stop being funny for a minute? I need to pee. Um, well, I think funny is very subjective
[713.09s -> 717.73s]  to people. So you, you might've thought that was really funny would just happen, but somebody else
[717.73s -> 721.33s]  might not think that what I just did was funny. And you two need to come to some common ground
[721.33s -> 725.90s]  of what you think is funny with for me because, um, it's very subjective. So I think you could
[725.90s -> 736.26s]  have made a lot of people very upset with what you just said. I need a container for the fish.
[736.26s -> 749.44s]  It's a comedy committee. All right. So I got it. What the hell have we been doing?
[749.44s -> 756.45s]  All right. What the hell happened? The wolf, right? I remember the wolf. I remember this guy,
[756.45s -> 763.07s]  the avalanche. We reported the avalanche. I remember that we had, we cooked dinner. We cooked
[763.07s -> 773.44s]  lunch for people. I did. I have access to the snowmobile. So I got to track down the snowmobile.
[773.44s -> 783.68s]  This is Nancy Drew guys. Beyond centrist Andy. Really cold. How do you go? Wait, wait,
[783.76s -> 791.46s]  beyond centrist Andy. What? Wait a minute. That's not correct. Wouldn't beyond centrist Andy be
[792.86s -> 798.58s]  like not in the middle. That would be beyond the middle. So I can't be,
[798.58s -> 803.97s]  I can't go too far centrist because that means I've got, I have to go somewhere.
[803.97s -> 811.28s]  If I don't get warm soon, she's going to die. She's going to die. Why is she, what's happening?
[811.28s -> 814.32s]  Turn around, turn around, turn around. Where am I going? Turn around, turn around. Nancy,
[814.32s -> 826.10s]  turn around. I used to go lake. No, this way. I'm walking wicked stiff too. All right. There's
[826.10s -> 834.91s]  this snowmobile. Let me go inside and warm up for a second. Warm again. This is an unhinged
[834.91s -> 846.27s]  stream incoming. No, it's not. No, it's on the Z axis. You're still a centrist. Z axis.
[848.99s -> 878.64s]  What? I want to go. What? Okay. It's 7 a.m. Hold on a minute. Sure. Am I being put into time out?
[878.64s -> 887.25s]  Is this time out? Get in there and, and, and stay, stay there for a while. What? Wait,
[887.25s -> 891.89s]  what are we eating? French toast. I didn't tell me how to make French toast. I thought I only
[891.89s -> 899.36s]  know how to make hamburgers. How do you make French toast? I didn't get a tutorial. Oh, hold on.
[900.70s -> 906.86s]  Yes, may order French toast. You hear the cook. Are you just waiting for breakfast? What is French
[906.86s -> 910.46s]  toast? I don't know how to make this. What is this? Where's this? Where's the step by step
[910.46s -> 918.05s]  instruction? I would just drink an orange juice and walk out. I would take the, the yogurt in the
[918.05s -> 925.98s]  sitting in the ice, which always freaks me out. But, you know, whatever. Like I know that when
[925.98s -> 930.06s]  the yogurt sitting in the ice, I kind of feel like I want that in a, I don't, I want it in the fridge
[930.06s -> 935.25s]  because it's like yogurt. I don't want it left out because what if like the top part's getting cold?
[935.25s -> 938.21s]  I mean, the bottom part's getting freezing cold. The top part might be at like room temp. I don't
[938.21s -> 943.79s]  know. Anyway, somebody is asking, do you know how to make French toast without the book? Let me,
[943.79s -> 954.29s]  let me see if I get it right. Okay. It's two pieces of bread and you dunk the bread in egg,
[954.29s -> 963.90s]  in an egg wash. And then after you soak the bread in an egg wash, you put it on like a pan
[963.90s -> 969.74s]  and you kind of cook it. And then you put, I don't know, like cinnamon sugar on it. I don't eat French
[969.74s -> 972.86s]  toast. I don't really like French toast. Why would I know how to make this? Why would I care
[972.86s -> 983.42s]  about making the food that I don't eat? I don't eat French toast. Why do I care? I'm not a sugary
[983.42s -> 992.82s]  breakfast guy. I'm a savory breakfast guy. Eggs, corned beef hash, bacon, sausage, toast, orange
[992.82s -> 997.70s]  juice, a shitload, a huge, like a 32 ounce glass of orange juice. I'm talking like a fucking thermos
[997.70s -> 1002.18s]  that you would take if you were going hiking for like three days. That amount of orange juice.
[1002.82s -> 1012.24s]  All right. What do they want? Okay. French toast and Canadian bacon should be cooked on the griddle.
[1012.80s -> 1016.56s]  Omelette should be in the frying pan. Make sure all food is thoroughly cooked before removing it
[1016.56s -> 1020.80s]  from the griddle or pan. French toast and omelette should be golden brown while Canadian bacon should
[1020.80s -> 1026.40s]  be lightly browned. Making an omelette, simply add any old, any, when making an omelette, simply add
[1026.40s -> 1033.18s]  any extra ingredients to the pan of egg mixture. Fold the omelette over, whatever. Okay. I'm just
[1033.18s -> 1040.62s]  going to, they're going to get what they get. How many pieces of French toast? It's two, right?
[1041.34s -> 1049.17s]  Is it done? How do I pick this up?
[1053.25s -> 1058.77s]  Fanning through the book with a piece in my hand. Oh, that's not it. How do I put this down?
[1065.34s -> 1073.90s]  What? Okay. Honestly, how do I put it down? One French toast. I put this ingredient down.
[1078.74s -> 1092.06s]  Okay. There's French toast. Beautiful. Three Canadian bacon. Okay. I flip it.
[1092.70s -> 1111.42s]  Do I, why is this not cooking? Is the oven on? Oh, okay. Three, one omelette and then you want
[1111.42s -> 1117.02s]  spinach, two bacon, one bacon, two spinach and two green peppers. All right. Omelette. Where's the egg?
[1119.87s -> 1135.14s]  Okay. And then what? What do you want? Fuck. This is wrong. Three. Okay. One bacon, two spinach,
[1135.14s -> 1147.20s]  two green peppers. What is this bacon? One bacon, two, what is this spinach? One bacon, two spinach,
[1147.84s -> 1170.13s]  two green peppers. Okay. Hey, come on. We're hungry here. I'm going. I'm working. Okay.
[1171.25s -> 1176.30s]  Order up. Order up. Three French toast, two Canadian bacon. That's all you want.
[1176.86s -> 1192.54s]  Imagine waiting hours for French toast. Imagine forcing somebody that doesn't know anything about
[1192.54s -> 1197.98s]  how to cook meals from more than one or two people at a time and not being a chef. I'm a fucking
[1198.06s -> 1202.78s]  detective at a detective agency telling that person that they need to be the chef
[1202.78s -> 1207.26s]  for an expensive lodge. Order up. I can tell you one thing that that would be pretty dumb.
[1209.36s -> 1216.30s]  Are we sure that it's, am I, am I wrong here? Okay. Two French toast, one omelette. Let's get
[1216.30s -> 1223.41s]  the French toast on there. And what do you want in it? Spinach, cheese, three green, three olives.
[1223.41s -> 1229.82s]  Spinach, cheese, three green, three olives. Spinach, green, three olives. I don't remember.
[1229.82s -> 1239.71s]  One spinach, one cheese, three green peppers. Ah, what? Oh my God. I'm fucking so mad right now.
[1242.72s -> 1248.72s]  You don't bring me here. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. What if, you know what?
[1248.72s -> 1257.81s]  Who cares? Does it matter? I don't know who cares. Just French toast. Just eat it.
[1260.03s -> 1269.86s]  One French toast. Everybody wants French. Just make, I don't care if it sits here. I need one
[1269.86s -> 1280.42s]  French toast, two, three, four, five, six, seven French toast. So one, just fill the whole thing
[1280.42s -> 1288.53s]  because it's going here. You wanted one. You wanted one. You wanted one. You wanted two.
[1290.99s -> 1299.07s]  You wanted, ah. Oh my God. This is embarrassing. This is embarrassment. I fucking didn't get it.
[1299.07s -> 1302.51s]  All right. I, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be in the kitchen. I don't want to be
[1302.51s -> 1305.78s]  in the kitchen. I don't want to fucking be here. I would never do this and I would never do it.
[1305.78s -> 1318.77s]  Nancy, you need to cook for like 10 people. Good. Hire a chef. Thank you. One, one, two.
[1319.49s -> 1335.31s]  Oh my God. If I just press a goddamn button. All right. Two, three, four, five, six, seven pieces.
[1335.31s -> 1358.30s]  Okay. So it's two and then three. And then it's two. Single task Andy. I don't want to mess it up.
[1358.30s -> 1362.86s]  This game, guys, this game came out when some of you guys weren't even born yet.
[1362.86s -> 1371.60s]  All right. Give me, give me a minute. All right. Three Canadian bacon or five, six, seven. All
[1371.60s -> 1392.26s]  right. So let's do three. And then, okay, three. Okay. So this three here, why does this take so
[1392.26s -> 1400.18s]  much longer than anything else? But I feel like this would be the fastest thing to go. Okay.
[1401.76s -> 1421.33s]  Then two Canadian bacon, five, six, seven. This is two, three. How many people here weren't born in
[1421.33s -> 1430.45s]  2007? Is that when this game came out? I apparently have a lot of 10 year olds here. I didn't think
[1430.45s -> 1433.73s]  about that. How many does it want? Three? Stop making me laugh. You're fucking me up.
[1437.02s -> 1459.01s]  This whole channel is 10 year olds. All right. Two more. Dude, 2007 was 28 years ago. Aware.
[1466.75s -> 1474.26s]  All right. Now we do the complicated shit with the omelets. One omelet. So this person wants a
[1474.26s -> 1480.50s]  fully, this one person wants a fully loaded omelet. One bacon, three spinach, three cheese.
[1480.50s -> 1485.30s]  I would put the cheese first. In my opinion, the greens and vegetables is after. This is throwing
[1485.30s -> 1499.81s]  me off. One bacon, three cheese. One bacon. One, two, three. Three spinach, three peppers, one olive.
[1506.43s -> 1516.06s]  Here you go. What the hell do you want? One bacon, one spinach. What the hell else do you want? Two
[1516.06s -> 1533.23s]  green, one olive. Order up. All right. That's all you wanted, right? Omelets kind of suck. Yeah.
[1533.23s -> 1537.46s]  Actually, I'm not a big fan of omelets either. To me, omelets almost feel like they're too much.
[1539.42s -> 1543.34s]  Order up. I don't know why. Sounds like we've eaten a whole omelet. Just kind of like,
[1544.62s -> 1553.22s]  I can't, I can't really do it. All right. Two bacon, two spinach, one green. Two bacon, two spinach,
[1553.94s -> 1561.30s]  one green. What else do you want? Two olives. What do you want in here? No omelet. Okay.
[1561.86s -> 1571.17s]  So you're done. Order up. So you want three spinach, one cheese, two green, three spinach,
[1572.37s -> 1586.96s]  two, wait, two green, one cheese, two olives. Wait, which one is this one? I forget.
[1589.25s -> 1594.61s]  Which one is the, who got, who got this one? Who got this one? This is this person's, right?
[1597.01s -> 1618.69s]  Order up. Okay. Good. And then no omelet for you? Order up. We got it. We did it. Finally. Cheese.
[1621.04s -> 1631.42s]  Okay. So I think we're all right. I think we did a pretty good job. We're good. So now what
[1631.42s -> 1653.28s]  were we doing? Oh, the snowmobile. Let's get the hell out of here. Move. Can't you, how am I driving
[1653.28s -> 1676.51s]  this on this? Doesn't it have to be in snow? What is going on? Oh no, Nancy's dead. Wait, how?
[1676.51s -> 1714.21s]  Oh. Have I fired? Oh no. Okay. Well, now we know what happens when you just hold the
[1715.22s -> 1725.36s]  pedal down to the floor. Honestly, to crash that many times as violently as I, Jesus Christ,
[1726.00s -> 1729.94s]  to crash that violently, I feel like the car needs to be made out of magnets or something.
[1729.94s -> 1758.91s]  And it just pulled me around. Um, what is the hit box? What are you in there? Oh, okay. I think I
[1758.91s -> 1773.06s]  made it. The sign's not buried. So I guess there hasn't been an avalanche. Okay. How do I put the
[1773.06s -> 1792.61s]  key down? No, I want to put the key away. Why can I spell avalanche right now? Okay. I'm not looking
[1792.61s -> 1807.09s]  at chat. Avalanche. A-V-A-L-A-N-C-H-E. Avalanche. Correct? I didn't look at chat. I promise. So
[1807.09s -> 1830.16s]  maybe I can't, I guess I can't do anything here. It just seems any secrets are up and up here.
[1830.16s -> 1837.12s]  You should do a spelling bee. You know, a streamer spelling bee. Like, yeah, that would actually be
[1837.12s -> 1843.01s]  pretty funny and just pick wicked, easy fucking words. I guarantee you we would eliminate half
[1843.01s -> 1847.54s]  the people. I, cause you know why I know that? Cause I know I would be eliminated by spelling
[1847.54s -> 1852.66s]  like a simple five-letter, four-letter word, like five-letter word. I don't think you even
[1852.66s -> 1855.78s]  need to go up to like seven or eight letters. I think everyone would get eliminated after like
[1855.78s -> 1865.84s]  the fifth. So what, what, what did I do wrong? Is arrow pointing me back to the lodge?
[1867.04s -> 1882.80s]  Like where is this moment to go? I need shoes. Oh, I probably do need snow shoes. That's all right.
[1895.94s -> 1911.36s]  In the play testing for this game, people probably got lost. I probably need snow shoes. Okay. So
[1911.36s -> 1929.92s]  then now what's, what's the progress then? What's the progress? Much better. I was really cold.
[1929.92s -> 1937.14s]  Tell the guy there was an avalanche. I did. Oh, I was checking to see if there was an avalanche.
[1937.14s -> 1942.46s]  And now we have to tell the person downstairs, whoever that was, that there was not an avalanche.
[1942.46s -> 1948.46s]  Now I remember. Sorry guys. I was playing like Diablo four every 30 minutes. I don't even
[1948.46s -> 1954.50s]  remember what happened in Diablo four. And I played it again too. It was pretty cool though.
[1954.50s -> 1974.38s]  All right. Where is this dude in here? Where the hell are you? Hey, I did.
[1974.78s -> 1983.74s]  No avalanche. There's your snowmobile key. You make a report to the eye cup. Um, I see, uh,
[1983.74s -> 1987.87s]  and then after the, after that, I think there's a, um, I think after there's a U and then after
[1987.87s -> 1996.27s]  that, there's what, uh, A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P the 16th letter of the alphabet, which is
[1996.27s -> 2004.13s]  P. I think that's how it's spelled. I think I got it. Wait, what? Oh, what do you got to tell me?
[2004.13s -> 2014.91s]  What did you tell me to spell? I forgot. That's okay. I'll call him. What else do you want?
[2014.91s -> 2022.85s]  Oh, I'll call them. Okay. I'll get out of your hair now. Good. What? What you need. That's all
[2022.85s -> 2029.02s]  the questions I had. Should I call? I probably should call anyways. I think it's just call
[2029.02s -> 2064.53s]  anyways, right? I want to go this way. Well, that kind of blew it all up to me. Now what do I do?
[2064.53s -> 2074.19s]  It's not the snowmobile. It's not the avalanche thing. So now what? We've been here. We've been
[2074.19s -> 2080.19s]  here. We've been here. We've been here. We did this. Wait. Yeah. We know we did. Maybe we'd know
[2080.19s -> 2103.49s]  we didn't do this. Did we go look in people's rooms again? Okay. I guess. Okay. What's the area
[2103.49s -> 2109.47s]  code though? Cause I want to call that. Why would it want this number here? If it wasn't supposed
[2109.47s -> 2123.46s]  to call it five, five, five, it's four Oh three. Was it four Oh three five, five, five, two eight.
[2123.46s -> 2130.05s]  What was it? Two eight, two eight. Hurry up. I, it's going to go dial tone on me. Two eight,
[2130.05s -> 2145.95s]  two eight, two eight, two eight, two eight, two eight, two nine, three eight. Oops. Your call
[2145.95s -> 2173.33s]  cannot be completed. Four oh three, five, five, five, two nine, eight, three, two, three, eight, three.
[2173.33s -> 2193.84s]  This is going to, is anyone going to pick up? Well, I mean, I'm just going to, what are these?
[2193.84s -> 2217.34s]  What's the maximum amount of rings? Oh, so what's that ring? Two, three, eight, three. It was wrong.
[2217.34s -> 2255.95s]  Two, three, eight, three, two, three, eight, three. What? Uh, what about three 12? Oh yeah.
[2255.95s -> 2290.77s]  God damn it. It was the first one. No, I want one. Okay. So we'll just say,
[2292.21s -> 2309.92s]  called, called Joe. There's no Joe. Joe mama. Ban everybody writing that. I want every,
[2309.92s -> 2314.34s]  every single person writing that right now. I want them banned from the channel and I want them
[2314.34s -> 2320.56s]  permanently five minute banned. And what that means is that you do not get unbanned within that
[2320.56s -> 2326.10s]  five minutes. So like, it's really funny until you get permanently banned for five minutes.
[2326.10s -> 2344.38s]  I don't know what the hell to do. There's the laundry bag again. I guess I'll just take it.
[2344.38s -> 2364.59s]  I need like phone numbers on here. All right. So I'm just going to go, but I need to find,
[2364.59s -> 2373.86s]  this is a granny like, although not really granny like means that I'm being pursued in
[2373.86s -> 2395.52s]  this house while I have to do all these things. Yeah. This, this predates a granny likes the bed
[2395.60s -> 2403.81s]  used towels clean no later than noon. Okay. I already, nobody's even using their room.
[2403.81s -> 2420.35s]  Is there nothing in here? There has to be something in here, right? This one has been locked.
[2420.35s -> 2430.10s]  I can't get even, I can't even get into this one. Who's in here? It's vacant. Oh, that's why.
[2430.10s -> 2439.50s]  But yeah, it's because it's vacant. Well, that's great. All right. Well, well,
[2439.50s -> 2445.50s]  let me see if anybody else has anything I have to do. I got to do everybody's bed.
[2445.50s -> 2465.97s]  All right. Fine, fine, fine, fine. There you go. Okay. There's four rooms that need it today.
[2465.97s -> 2487.28s]  What's this? Oh, interesting. This room is studying wolves. Hmm. Why, why do you have
[2487.28s -> 2503.33s]  this book? Okay. And you're a sculptor. Interesting. Who's in this room? I can ask
[2503.33s -> 2525.12s]  a few questions about that. I think who is in this room? Okay. This is who the hell's in here.
[2525.12s -> 2538.91s]  Oh, Lou. Okay. Lou Talbot, Lou Talbot. Interesting. Okay. Did they make this? Is this a children's
[2538.91s -> 2543.31s]  game? This is the person that had the wolf book in their room. The one to be like, you are like,
[2543.31s -> 2549.87s]  you like wolves. Yes, I do. And you did it. Yes, I did. Is that like the smoking gun in a way?
[2549.87s -> 2570.02s]  I have to imagine in my feed. Okay. Give me your laundry. Nice. I can't get into anybody else's
[2570.02s -> 2596.32s]  closets unless, wait. You forgot to put all the laundry in that bag. No, I got it all actually.
[2596.32s -> 2615.58s]  Are there people down here now hanging out that I can talk to? I'm just going to call Lou on the
[2615.58s -> 2626.29s]  phone. Nancy. Hey, got a proposition for you. Since Lou hears two chicken to go mano a mano
[2626.29s -> 2632.21s]  with me out there in the ice fishing shack. Snowshoeing is my thing, dude. Besides, it's
[2632.21s -> 2639.70s]  animal cruelty. Oh, you're Lou. Give me a break. You ever been ice fishing? I have. As a matter of
[2639.70s -> 2646.10s]  fact, I have. Excellent. Here's the deal. I need some competition. So I want you to go out there
[2646.10s -> 2650.10s]  and try to catch a bigger fish than I caught yesterday, which means you got to catch a two
[2650.10s -> 2654.82s]  foot northern pike. Now it's a bit of a hike out to the lake, but the shack is solar heated.
[2654.82s -> 2659.70s]  I already did this even from first. So what do you say, kiddo? You game? Anything to make
[2659.70s -> 2667.49s]  your guests happy. Atta girl. Well, I'll let you get back to beating Lou. Do I need a place to
[2667.49s -> 2675.22s]  keep it or no? What's up? So you go to school and talk to me here? Yep. University of California,
[2675.30s -> 2683.63s]  Brea. What degree are you working on? Master of fine arts. Hmm. What's your favorite medium?
[2683.63s -> 2688.83s]  Cool. So what's your favorite medium? Holograms. What is this? Like the Spanish Inquisition.
[2689.47s -> 2696.59s]  Hey, give her a break. She's just trying to make pleasant conversation. Oh, right. Um,
[2697.31s -> 2706.61s]  my favorite medium, dirt. Dirt. You paint with dirt? I create works of art by manipulating
[2706.61s -> 2711.57s]  naturally occurring geophysical substances like dirt. Oh, sometimes I just use my hands,
[2711.57s -> 2715.81s]  but most of the time heavy machineries. So you're blowing up pieces of the earth.
[2715.81s -> 2719.17s]  No, what do you understand? You're like throwing grenade. You're like burying grenades and like
[2719.17s -> 2727.38s]  taking great to be misunderstood. FYI, Ralph Waldo Emerson said that. Yeah. Yeah. You're like
[2727.38s -> 2733.60s]  using explosives to create art in like out in the wilderness or something, right? I think that
[2733.60s -> 2743.25s]  might be what it is. Is this your first time at the lodge? Yep. My car broke down on my way to
[2743.25s -> 2747.89s]  Lake Louise last summer, pulled in here to wait for the tow truck and figured it'd be a cool place
[2747.89s -> 2757.92s]  to visit during the winter. So here I am. Well, good luck. Well, let's go catch the fish. At least
[2757.92s -> 2762.75s]  that's the way we know we have to do. I can't wait to have to play somebody in this because
[2762.75s -> 2770.30s]  you know, I'm going to have to and I don't want to. No need to go in there till it's time to cook.
[2770.30s -> 2778.77s]  I already went over this, but this is from the oldest RPGs. Like D&D taught us this like almost
[2778.77s -> 2785.58s]  a hundred years ago. People are good at stuff. The whole the whole reason for like a party system
[2785.58s -> 2790.46s]  is because everybody's good at different things. I don't want to be the chef. I don't want to be
[2790.46s -> 2796.38s]  the manager. I don't want to be the performer at the fucking comedy club that's down the street.
[2796.38s -> 2804.75s]  We all do the things that we're good at. That's why if RPGs have taught us anything. All right,
[2804.75s -> 2818.08s]  how do I get back to the lake? Is it this way? Call the avalanche patrol? Uh, I was going to,
[2818.08s -> 2825.47s]  but that guy said he was going to do it anyways. You are literally a performer at a comedy club.
[2825.47s -> 2833.66s]  You don't see me cooking, do you? You don't see my like unbelievable chef skills. No, you don't. You
[2833.66s -> 2842.26s]  don't see me. Um, you know, I'm not, I can't, I can't really let him cook. Let him cook. No,
[2842.26s -> 2859.49s]  you don't really want me to. What about the egg salad? Well, the egg salad only requires a very
[2859.49s -> 2868.21s]  small amount of cooking. Go back to chicken ridge and risk getting caught in another avalanche.
[2868.21s -> 2873.01s]  I don't think so. All right. I, I need a map. Go back to chicken ridge and risk getting caught
[2873.01s -> 2879.90s]  in another avalanche. I don't think so. I'm not going out there again. I figured if I spun her
[2879.90s -> 2884.69s]  around a few times, she wouldn't know where she was either. It's like, I'm not going back there.
[2884.69s -> 2887.65s]  Oh yeah. Actually, you know what? You've spun me around enough times. That actually seems pretty
[2887.65s -> 2900.54s]  safe. Let's go that way. No more avalanches for me. Thank you very much. What was that lake? I feel
[2900.54s -> 2909.60s]  like I got lost accidentally and found my way to that lake. You were literally on a cooking stream.
[2909.68s -> 2924.83s]  Yes. Yes, I was. Would you have eaten any of the food that Charlie and I made? Okay. So what,
[2924.83s -> 2942.24s]  what's the point there? Aren't you making the point for me? I need to look at a map because
[2942.24s -> 2946.24s]  this is, Oh, here it is. I got it. Too cold to go any further. Oh, come on. All right. I got it.
[2946.24s -> 2957.68s]  It's the skating pond. It's the skating pond. Is it get in the house? Oh my God. I just clicked off
[2957.68s -> 2981.36s]  of it. Much better. Okay. It's really cold. Go right back out here. Is it the skating pond
[2981.36s -> 3003.28s]  past the skating pond? Save the game. It was, wasn't it? I don't remember. No, it's not. It was
[3003.28s -> 3020.35s]  like a weird, it was like a shack. And I remember being like, how did I even get here? It's past
[3020.35s -> 3034.75s]  the snowball fight area. It's not that way. Which way? I better not follow this trail until I know
[3034.75s -> 3070.50s]  for sure where it goes. Nobody remember over here. Oh, Oh, nice hit. Nice job. Oh, look out. Oh,
[3070.50s -> 3075.92s]  it got me. You let me bite. Now let me bite. Now get out of the way. I'll get out of the way. Get
[3075.92s -> 3093.41s]  out of the way. Thank you. It was fun. Very fun time. If I don't get warm soon, I may not make it.
[3093.41s -> 3101.26s]  All right. Well, hurry up. Okay. Catch the fish. It looks like someone came in here and just
[3101.26s -> 3106.54s]  wrecked everything, including the fishing gear. What? So much for catching a two foot northern
[3106.54s -> 3111.74s]  pike. It's definitely one of the two of them then. I can't fish. The tackles ruined. There's
[3111.74s -> 3117.74s]  somebody one step ahead of me. It's one of those two. Left behind by whoever trashed this place.
[3117.98s -> 3153.01s]  Birds of the Southwest. Okay. All right. Calling that. Get me out of here. Uninstall Diablo four,
[3153.01s -> 3176.50s]  please. I'm starting to get really cold. Why? It's Lou. It's definitely Lou. Somebody left me a note.
[3176.50s -> 3188.78s]  A note. Nancy Drew. Hmm. I really like playing snowball fights with you, but I'm afraid you
[3188.78s -> 3193.81s]  won't want to play with me anymore. If you play with me and win, I'll give you my top secret way
[3193.81s -> 3198.37s]  I can... Oh, this is a little kid. Nevermind. I thought this was like a mastermind criminal or
[3198.37s -> 3204.18s]  something. I'll give you my top secret way I can stay out in the cold for so long. Wait, wait.
[3204.18s -> 3233.50s]  Ready. Secret. I better not follow this trail until I know for sure where it goes. Wait, where?
[3234.30s -> 3270.06s]  Dude, this voice. What did you just throw at me? I didn't even see it. What did I even get? What is
[3270.06s -> 3276.99s]  that? What the... No, I don't want to use it right now. What is that? I didn't want to even take that.
[3276.99s -> 3286.45s]  What drugs did I just take? What did I just take? Did I soft lock myself or something?
[3286.45s -> 3311.86s]  Was it a hand warmer? Why did I use it? What just happened? All right. Let's make the call.
[3315.42s -> 3403.04s]  202-555-7237. Damn it. Two... What is it? 202-555-202-7237. Interesting. So, hey. Lou? Where's Lou? Lou?
[3416.22s -> 3420.26s]  Who? Has he been here the whole time with you?
[3425.82s -> 3436.34s]  What? You're kidding. So my gear's ruined? Yep. Completely. So much for our little fishing contest.
[3436.34s -> 3443.54s]  Wait a minute. Ollie ice fishes. Go ask him for a hook and line and don't take no for an answer.
[3443.54s -> 3453.58s]  Oh, okay. I'll see you two later, okay? Where's Ollie? Who's Ollie? I don't know who that is.
[3453.58s -> 3460.32s]  I've just learned these two people's names into long term memory like five minutes ago. So,
[3460.32s -> 3465.12s]  actually, I don't even know who the person on the right is. I'll catch you later. In real.
[3465.12s -> 3469.04s]  If you told me, Jerma, I'll give you a million dollars right now, tell me this guy's full name.
[3469.04s -> 3472.56s]  I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't think I wouldn't be able to do it. Even if you said it,
[3472.56s -> 3477.73s]  I'll give you a million dollars. I have no... I don't know what his first name is. I have no idea.
[3477.73s -> 3495.22s]  I know this is Lou. It's time to serve lunch now. Not time for kitchen duty yet. Okay. So,
[3495.22s -> 3502.22s]  I need to go find Ollie. Who's Ollie? Is Ollie this person down here? It's two people down.
[3502.22s -> 3508.82s]  This is Ollie? I'm glad for the chance to talk once again. There is something I must explain.
[3508.82s -> 3516.29s]  Sure. There is? What I said before about wolves, it is because my grandmother was killed by wolves,
[3516.29s -> 3526.24s]  killed and devoured. Okay. Are you serious? Years ago, when my mother was a little girl,
[3526.24s -> 3531.12s]  her mother, my grandmother was on her way back from the village on her motor scooter,
[3531.12s -> 3536.48s]  which was and still is the only means of transportation most Fredonians can afford.
[3536.48s -> 3543.36s]  It was January and the sun had just set and it was dark, very cold. There were thousands of
[3543.36s -> 3549.60s]  wolves in the countryside that winter. At night, they would roam in huge hungry packs. My grandmother
[3549.60s -> 3554.88s]  was halfway home when she came upon a young man waving from the side of the road for her to stop.
[3554.88s -> 3560.00s]  Wait a minute. He too had been on a scooter, but his had broken down and wolves were gathering
[3560.00s -> 3564.72s]  all around him, preparing to attack. My grandmother, of course, stopped and he
[3564.72s -> 3569.20s]  leapt on behind her and they took off down the road with the wolves, dozens of them
[3569.20s -> 3574.96s]  chasing after them. But with two people riding it, her scooter was slow, much too slow and the
[3574.96s -> 3581.12s]  wolves soon caught up with them. When one of the wolves seized my grandmother's boot and its teeth
[3581.12s -> 3587.28s]  and started to pull, instead of helping her, the man pushed her off the bike. It instantly gained
[3587.28s -> 3596.13s]  speed and he got away. My grandmother, set upon by the wolves, did not. If she died, how do you know
[3596.13s -> 3601.25s]  that's what happened? If she died, how do you know that's what happened? Tormented by guilt,
[3601.25s -> 3606.93s]  the young man eventually confessed. He went to prison for several years and the wolves were
[3606.93s -> 3613.41s]  hunted year round until the countryside was rid of them. But the damage was done. I don't think
[3613.41s -> 3623.01s]  that's what happened. Yeah. You ever see Lou Talbot when you're out there training?
[3623.41s -> 3627.57s]  Ever see Lou Talbot when you're out there training? The college student?
[3627.57s -> 3635.22s]  Just yesterday I had to slow down to avoid colliding with him. It ruined my whole session.
[3635.22s -> 3638.66s]  Chantal would like to use your name and picture on her website when she gets it.
[3639.46s -> 3648.43s]  Would that be okay? I'm sorry, but no. Guilty. Oh, well, so much for that. I have disturbed you
[3648.43s -> 3658.74s]  long enough. Kavicinaya. We've got some more info. Why do I feel like this is in slow motion?
[3662.08s -> 3681.22s]  I'm hearing slow motion artifact sounds. Does it sound like that? What you need? Someone went
[3681.22s -> 3684.58s]  into the ice fishing shack and ruined all of Bill Kessler's equipment. Someone went into the ice
[3684.58s -> 3689.94s]  fishing shack and ruined all of Bill Kessler's equipment. Probably some animal loving eco
[3689.94s -> 3697.01s]  fanatic who figured it was time to save the fish. How am I going to catch it? Problem is,
[3697.01s -> 3703.01s]  Mr. Kessler still insists that I try to catch a two foot northern pike. Say no more. There's
[3703.01s -> 3709.89s]  my tackle box. Oh, yes. Yes. Me into competing with him, but I can't very well do that when
[3709.89s -> 3715.65s]  you've got my hook and line now, can I? No, I don't suppose you can. What else do you want?
[3715.65s -> 3721.09s]  That's it. That's all the questions I had. By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the
[3721.09s -> 3726.21s]  rooms were cleaned. So I put it back up at the front desk. How is that even possible? I don't
[3726.21s -> 3732.78s]  even care. If that's not game breaking, game progress breaking, I'm not doing it ever again.
[3733.50s -> 3762.38s]  I don't care. Yeah. OK, come on, kid. I feel like this is Groundhog Day and I have to do this every
[3762.38s -> 3768.14s]  day. Eventually. See, I've gotten so good at this because this is like the 5000th time I've had to
[3768.14s -> 3797.94s]  do this. I love this voice. I want to hear more of it. I like it. I like this voice. It's cute.
[3797.94s -> 3816.35s]  It's like imagine. It is really, really cold out here. It sounds like Cartman. All right,
[3816.99s -> 3832.96s]  let's do what we were supposed to do an hour ago. Close to two feet, right? It's Dark Souls 2.
[3835.52s -> 3847.98s]  It does it. You'll hear it again. Just you'll hear it. It goes. It goes done, done, done,
[3847.98s -> 3860.77s]  done, done, done. It does it for one. It's one part of the song. Not this part. Yes, it does.
[3860.77s -> 3896.26s]  Just wait. Never mind. It goes done, done, done. And then that's it. It does it for one part of the
[3896.26s -> 3907.84s]  song. I mean, I'm like I'm a I'm a plastic beach fan, so I guess I have one of my favorite albums.
[3907.84s -> 3918.86s]  Rats too small. Also, I vodka pineapple. It's super good. It's not a whole lot of
[3918.86s -> 3943.25s]  bullshit. Yeah, I don't, you know, that's what I drink. Oh, no, that one looks pretty good.
[3943.25s -> 3968.75s]  Rats too small. That was that's it. Oh, come on. There was that won't do.
[3974.75s -> 3981.97s]  Shit. It's not. It's not that one. There we go. Yay. Northern Pike fishing for me.
[3982.29s -> 3991.28s]  Gameplay resident sleeper. Hold on a second. Somebody resident sleeper, Nancy Drew.
[3995.10s -> 4003.46s]  Wait a second here. OK. OK. All right.
[4014.40s -> 4024.69s]  What did he fucking throw at me? Oh, my gosh. Whoever threw that ice ball at me must have set
[4024.69s -> 4030.21s]  off an explosion that shattered the ice. Huh? My jacket's gone. No wonder I'm so cold.
[4032.34s -> 4047.78s]  What? You're the worst detective I've ever heard of. I need to make it to shore by jumping from
[4047.78s -> 4055.41s]  ice floe to ice floe and put on that coat. Wait, Nancy. Nancy, somebody. Oh, hold on.
[4057.34s -> 4083.09s]  What the hell is happening here? How do I get over there? How do I how do I get over there?
[4083.09s -> 4109.28s]  What? I can't reach it. There's no I didn't know you could go diagonal.
[4110.00s -> 4124.69s]  Those weren't even touching. First of all, I don't know. Let's come. I need to talk about
[4124.69s -> 4131.90s]  this for a second. Nancy, if somebody throws a snowball at you and then the room you are in
[4131.90s -> 4142.67s]  explodes, it wasn't a snowball. Like, oh, no, if somebody threw a snowball at me and something
[4142.67s -> 4171.26s]  blew up, I must have caused an explosion. I don't what how am I supposed to do this?
[4171.26s -> 4186.13s]  What are we trying to do here? That is what OK, I have to step on this one to be able to get up
[4186.13s -> 4221.39s]  there. I understand how it works now. We just got to get over there quick. What's going on?
[4221.39s -> 4240.50s]  Come on, get up there. Spawn one up there. Is there a rhyme or reason to how this works?
[4240.50s -> 4261.25s]  Because I stepped on that one last time and it spawned one up here. This is just RNG. OK,
[4261.25s -> 4312.69s]  so if I go diagonal, then it spawned that over there. What if I go diagonal again? I think the
[4312.93s -> 4320.80s]  idea to make it so you fill in these so that it has nowhere else to go makes the next one
[4320.80s -> 4353.71s]  over appear or disappear. I think it's random. Is that one? OK, then OK. I can't use the heat
[4353.71s -> 4358.96s]  pack. It's almost there. All right, just make my way over there. Come on, go, go, go, go, go.
[4358.96s -> 4396.38s]  Come on, do it already. I'd be freaking out if I were you, dude. I'm all right. I just don't.
[4397.82s -> 4401.97s]  Is there a pattern? It doesn't feel like there is. If I go down, what happens?
[4402.61s -> 4408.37s]  It takes that one down. I go up. It takes the one above me. If I go down, will it
[4408.37s -> 4418.77s]  reappear? No, it won't. So what if I go left? What if I go right? OK, left again. Up. OK,
[4418.77s -> 4421.74s]  all right. Wait, wait, wait. I think I'm starting to understand what's going on here. All right.
[4421.74s -> 4453.17s]  All right. All right. OK, so what is making it? So why did that spawn down there is the opposite
[4453.17s -> 4462.62s]  side? I don't know. I diagonal down left middle. No, it's definitely not random. It's OK. Well,
[4462.62s -> 4468.19s]  how do I know if it's going to move one or not? If I go down, it takes someone below
[4468.19s -> 4471.79s]  where I land. If I go up, it takes below. If I go left, it takes the next one to go right.
[4471.79s -> 4517.41s]  Diagonal is nothing throwing me off. Is that it? Did I get it? I think that's it. Is that it?
[4517.41s -> 4526.75s]  Fuck you. The blocks of ice are laid out in a grid pattern with horizontal, vertical,
[4526.75s -> 4532.72s]  and diagonal rows. If Nancy moves along a horizontal row, then random ice flows in that
[4532.72s -> 4537.60s]  row will appear or disappear. She moves in a vertical, then it will be ice flows in the
[4537.60s -> 4549.18s]  column that appeared. The same applies. Is this pre-recorded? No, it's just because you know
[4549.18s -> 4558.58s]  what I was about to say to you. I stopped myself. I stopped myself from saying. Have you been on this
[4558.58s -> 4572.56s]  for an hour? No, I just don't. We're fine. All right. I am starting to understand. So I want to
[4572.56s -> 4579.01s]  go diagonal because I want it to hold on. I want to like fill in the next diagonal spot, right?
[4579.01s -> 4593.78s]  I go like that and it'll have to. Okay. Fill it in again. Do it again. Fill it in.
[4602.16s -> 4635.79s]  It's just so cold. The ruin one lets you place one. Yeah. Got it. I don't know whose this is or
[4635.79s -> 4639.73s]  why that wolf left it here, but at least now I won't freeze to death.
[4639.73s -> 4646.18s]  Whose jacket is this? I feel warmer already. There's a note in one of the pockets.
[4655.70s -> 4666.05s]  Swear word. Since I can't go back the way I came, maybe these tracks will lead me to shelter.
[4667.01s -> 4684.59s]  Beautiful mountain range. Beautiful mountain range. Avalanche ridge. Not exactly reassuring.
[4685.82s -> 4689.26s]  At this point that I look up, I cup my hands to my mouth and I go
[4693.44s -> 4698.96s]  just fucking wait and see what happens. The snow's so deep. I'm sinking up to my knees.
[4701.14s -> 4705.46s]  If I want to follow those tracks, I'm going to need some snowshoes.
[4706.02s -> 4707.38s]  Oh, I know where to get those.
[4714.18s -> 4719.30s]  Reuse joke do better. There's like 10,000 people that weren't here when I did that like two years
[4719.30s -> 4742.24s]  ago. Stop it. What's this place called? Avalanche ridge. All right. So I got to get the
[4742.24s -> 4743.76s]  snowshoes to go to Avalanche ridge.
[4757.34s -> 4767.60s]  What? No, get. Wait, eat the thing. Eat the hand warmers. I don't eat them, but
[4768.40s -> 4780.27s]  hypothermia claims Icicle Creek lodge employee. What? Avalanche ridge. Not exactly reassuring.
[4781.15s -> 4786.19s]  Ski tracks. Probably Yanni's. I bet if I follow them, I'll wind up back at the lodge.
[4786.27s -> 4793.55s]  I was right. Nobody's going to look out the window and see Nancy Drew is like blue
[4793.55s -> 4802.64s]  with icicles all over her face and shit. So come on. Was nobody aware? If I don't get warm soon,
[4803.36s -> 4831.22s]  I may not make it. I feel warmer. Lunchtime. I got it. I got this. Don't worry. Oh, wait,
[4831.22s -> 4841.82s]  somebody's sleeping. Well, who are you? Well, keep it down. Somebody's sleeping over there.
[4843.54s -> 4850.18s]  Uh, I'm Elsa's replacement. Oh, the new maid. Thank goodness. I was wondering how much longer
[4850.18s -> 4858.00s]  the owner expected us to endure these conditions and still pay full price. I'm trying to learn
[4858.00s -> 4863.44s]  everyone's name. What's your name? My name is Guadalupe Comeo. My friends call me Lupe.
[4866.11s -> 4872.83s]  So I should call you Lupe. I hardly think so, dear. Yeah. I don't even know your name.
[4872.83s -> 4879.39s]  My name's Nancy Drew. Wonderful. Now be a doll and clean my room first. It'll hardly take you
[4879.39s -> 4886.11s]  any time at all, especially compared to the other rooms. The other guests are all men, single men.
[4886.75s -> 4893.98s]  Well, I'm happy to report that I've already cleaned your room. Excellent. What are you doing? I hate
[4893.98s -> 4901.42s]  to sound nosy, but what are you doing? Birds. I'm watching birds. That's what I am. You see a bird
[4901.42s -> 4907.66s]  watcher. Sometimes I go outside and watch and sometimes I stay inside. It all depends on what
[4907.66s -> 4914.22s]  the birds feel like doing and what I feel like doing. She fucked up the, she fucked up the
[4914.22s -> 4926.19s]  shack. That was the bird newspaper with the number on it. There's a bird magazine. Hmm. So that's
[4926.19s -> 4931.55s]  what brought you to Icicle Creek Lodge, the birding? Absolutely. The place is a veritable
[4931.55s -> 4938.67s]  birding paradise, even in winter. In fact, in the short time I've been here, I've seen hawks,
[4938.67s -> 4943.55s]  eagles, orioles, cardinals, jays. I was just going to say, oh yeah, name three birds.
[4945.87s -> 4950.88s]  I should have said it. I was holding it until the conversation was over. I was right about to say,
[4950.88s -> 4954.64s]  oh yeah, name three birds. That would have been really funny. I was holding it because I didn't
[4954.64s -> 4960.13s]  want to talk over the conversation. Well, okay. Well, you named three birds. There you go.
[4960.21s -> 4965.42s]  Have you met the other guests? I've bumped into them at one time or another. Yes, I don't spend
[4965.42s -> 4972.14s]  all my time in front of this window. That Yanni fellow, he's very talented, but extremely intense.
[4972.14s -> 4977.26s]  His whole life revolves around being the best in the world. As for the two who are always sitting
[4977.26s -> 4983.50s]  across the way playing that silly game, the older man, Bill Kessler, he's no deep thinker,
[4983.50s -> 4988.70s]  but he's nice enough. But the other one, that college student, talking to him is like trying
[4988.70s -> 4993.82s]  to converse with a giant turnip. You're hiding booze in there? You're hiding booze in there?
[4993.82s -> 4999.41s]  I almost prefer talking to the handyman, almost. Okay. Anyone that intent on destroying something
[4999.41s -> 5005.26s]  as glorious as that wolf is hardly worth talking to. I'm just gonna say it's a little quiet.
[5006.16s -> 5015.10s]  You can turn it up. Let me know if that's better. Have you seen the wolf? Have you ever seen the
[5015.10s -> 5021.18s]  wolf that's been hanging out around here? No, not that I'm looking for it. Of course, Yanni
[5021.18s -> 5027.87s]  occasionally skis by, and that dullard, the student, I see him snowshoeing occasionally,
[5027.87s -> 5037.22s]  but I've yet to see the wolf. Have you seen it? No, you see, I have. Yeah, up close and personal,
[5037.22s -> 5041.38s]  as a matter of fact. How did it act? Was it aggressive? Did it look injured?
[5042.58s -> 5047.84s]  You seem to really want to know a lot about this wolf, even though you claim to not really care,
[5048.77s -> 5054.14s]  and you're hiding booze in those binoculars. I don't think I fucking don't know.
[5056.83s -> 5062.35s]  Actually, I think it may have saved my life. Really? Of course, its behavior does suggest
[5062.35s -> 5068.51s]  that it's had contact with humans before. Have you told anyone else what you just told me?
[5068.51s -> 5076.66s]  No. Good. Don't. You see, I'd like to see this wolf for myself, and I don't want everyone else
[5076.66s -> 5080.50s]  going after it and scaring it away. Okay, I have to tell everybody. There's no telling what that
[5080.50s -> 5084.90s]  trigger-happy handyman might do. So it'll just be our little secret, all right?
[5087.23s -> 5092.03s]  No. No. No, because I'm not going to end up with a kitchen knife in my back in 10 minutes.
[5092.03s -> 5096.35s]  I'm going to tell everybody. Do you want a book about birds of the southwest?
[5096.35s -> 5105.33s]  I might. Why do you ask? Hmm. See, I just like, just totally just throw this whole thing under
[5105.33s -> 5112.05s]  the bus and just be like, well, because I know what you're doing. I know everything. And I know
[5112.05s -> 5118.42s]  there's booze in there. Because I found a piece of a book cover in the fishing shack,
[5118.42s -> 5121.38s]  and since it was about birds, I wondered if it was yours.
[5122.02s -> 5129.02s]  No, it's not from any book I have. I've never been in the ice fishing shack, so how could it be?
[5129.02s -> 5134.46s]  Yeah, but it forgot the whole part where I walk up to the window, get out a cigarette, like,
[5135.42s -> 5142.88s]  start smoking the cigarette and telling her about the magazine that I found in the shack.
[5142.88s -> 5148.77s]  Well, there was a magazine in the shack that had a lot of things about birds in it, and
[5148.77s -> 5153.66s]  well, I mean, not too many people around these parts really love birds as much as some people
[5153.66s -> 5160.21s]  I've talked to recently. Have a good afternoon. And I make loud fucking walking sounds. There's
[5160.21s -> 5168.32s]  like jingling on my person, you know what I mean? Just like, ching, ching, ching. I make noise
[5168.32s -> 5177.73s]  whenever I go anywhere. Good luck. Good luck with your birding. Au revoir.
[5177.81s -> 5185.50s]  Yeah, if I was a... Sorry, let me get my fucking 200-caliber sniper rifle I dropped on the ground.
[5187.10s -> 5188.78s]  I wonder what you're doing out here.
[5196.51s -> 5198.35s]  Okay, well then where did this just come from?
[5199.15s -> 5202.99s]  It was probably lying there on the floor all along and you just happened to kick it into view,
[5202.99s -> 5208.51s]  that's all. This did used to be a hunting lodge deer. I wouldn't worry about it.
[5208.51s -> 5213.98s]  Yeah, I'm telling you, if I was ever a detective, I'm having, I'm putting a bunch of coins in my
[5213.98s -> 5218.75s]  pocket. I'm going to walk around like a tambourine. I'm going to make sure that, like, I'm going to
[5218.75s -> 5224.67s]  wear, like, leather so it makes like... I'm going to be fucking loud as fuck if I go anywhere. I'm
[5224.67s -> 5229.39s]  going to be making all kinds of noise. Like, I'm going to lean down to stretch and look at, like,
[5229.95s -> 5239.98s]  where the body was. Yeah, interesting. Light up a cigarette. How'd they die?
[5239.98s -> 5248.90s]  Sure, am I just going to accuse this? Am I going to accuse her of this?
[5263.50s -> 5267.82s]  Worst joke? Why? I thought it was humorous.
[5267.82s -> 5272.59s]  You did it because you're a member of the Run and Grow Free and you're trying to protect the
[5272.59s -> 5277.15s]  wolf at any cost, aren't you? That's why you have that magazine in your room so you figure out how
[5277.15s -> 5289.49s]  to keep Olly Randall from shooting the wolf. These are both the same thing, aren't they?
[5289.49s -> 5291.89s]  If you didn't find this bullet, it would have ended up in your back.
[5314.78s -> 5319.18s]  I don't want to see anything happen to that wolf either. If you belong to Run and Grow Free,
[5319.18s -> 5325.26s]  just tell me. I'm good at keeping secrets, believe me. You're right, I am a member of the Run and Grow Free.
[5325.26s -> 5329.58s]  I'm a detective, aren't I trying to... I did make sure that brute would miss if he took a shot at
[5329.58s -> 5336.38s]  the wolf, and I will do whatever it takes to protect that beautiful creature. Hey, we're talking
[5336.38s -> 5341.57s]  about a potential crime that's being committed, but just tell me. I mean, just tell me the crime
[5341.57s -> 5352.45s]  you're committing. I can keep a secret so you're undercover. So you're here undercover? Yes.
[5355.44s -> 5361.74s]  What are you going to do next? What are you going to do next? That's all I'm going to tell you, Nancy.
[5361.74s -> 5376.00s]  And if you really are concerned about the wolf's welfare, you won't repeat any of this to anyone.
[5376.00s -> 5394.27s]  Let's not talk anymore, Nancy. People are starting to get suspicious. R1, R1, R1, R1, R1. Hey, hey,
[5394.27s -> 5398.99s]  you wouldn't believe what the fuck is going on in this lodge. Wait, can I talk to you?
[5398.99s -> 5406.27s]  Nancy, hi. What the heck happened out there? Actually, I'm not quite sure. I walked out to
[5406.27s -> 5410.83s]  Icicle Lake to see how you were doing in the fishing shack, only there wasn't any fishing
[5410.83s -> 5416.67s]  shack. There wasn't even a lake. The ice was all busted up like somebody dropped a bomb on it.
[5416.67s -> 5421.71s]  All I know is... I wouldn't want to be told any of this shit. I walked outside and someone knocked me
[5421.71s -> 5426.51s]  unconscious with an ice ball. The next thing I knew there was an explosion and I was on an ice
[5426.51s -> 5431.23s]  flow in the middle of the lake with no code and no fish. Somebody decked you with an ice
[5431.23s -> 5438.91s]  ball and blew up the lake? Holy moly. The good news is you're okay. The bad news? No more ice fishing.
[5441.79s -> 5445.87s]  I mean, I don't know, if like a detective came up to me and was like, hey, hey, listen to all this
[5445.87s -> 5452.34s]  shit that's going on. Hey, by the way, I know it's her. It'd be like, who? Oh, hey, the lady by the
[5452.34s -> 5459.30s]  window with the binoculars. Watch the fuck out. It's like, oh, but the arrestor, what are you
[5459.30s -> 5471.01s]  talking about? Yeah, by the way, hey, just want to let you know, she dropped a bullet. What? Yeah,
[5471.01s -> 5479.06s]  shut up, don't do that, I'm not supposed to tell anybody. You're not a cop. Oh, no, that's right.
[5479.62s -> 5490.05s]  I'm just like an investigative enthusiast, right? What is Nancy Drew's, what's Nancy Drew for a
[5490.05s -> 5513.92s]  career? You're literally like 16. Nancy Drew is just like a teenager. Oh, she's a true crime
[5513.92s -> 5527.38s]  podcast fan. Oh, since Mr. Talbot isn't here, could I play a game of fox and geese with you?
[5527.38s -> 5534.02s]  You bet. Have a seat. Here are the rules. Oh, no, I don't want to do this. The black piece is the fox.
[5534.02s -> 5538.26s]  The goal of the geese is to corner the fox so he can't move, while the goal of the fox
[5538.26s -> 5543.06s]  is to gobble up geese so that they can't corner him. The geese can only move forward along a
[5543.06s -> 5548.02s]  line to the next point, either directly forwards, diagonally, or sideways. You gotta slow down. Same
[5548.02s -> 5552.82s]  thing for the fox, except when he's next to a goose that has an empty spot directly behind it.
[5552.82s -> 5558.82s]  He can jump over it. Gobble it up. Right, gobble it up and remove it from the board. Dave. Just take
[5558.82s -> 5563.78s]  turns and play until somebody wins and somebody loses. Dave, I just found a bullet on the ground.
[5563.78s -> 5572.08s]  I don't want to do this. No, I don't. I really don't want to do this. I don't. The goal is to...
[5573.20s -> 5583.82s]  Let me read this for a minute. Okay. The goal of the geese is to corner the fox so he can't move.
[5583.82s -> 5590.30s]  The goal of the fox is to gobble up the geese so they can't corner him. The geese can only move
[5590.30s -> 5595.10s]  forward along a line to the next point, so the geese can only move forward. They can't go diagonal.
[5595.10s -> 5602.72s]  No, they can go diagonal, but they can only move one space, except when he's next to a goose that
[5602.72s -> 5608.70s]  has an empty spot behind it, he can just brute force the puzzle because it can't be that hard.
[5609.87s -> 5685.26s]  You bet. What team am I on? Shit in my... No! Can't restart. I don't... I take these things.
[5686.78s -> 5690.62s]  If I walk by and there's a puzzle like this being played, I walk right by it,
[5690.62s -> 5695.98s]  or I lean over to two people playing it and I go, oh, interesting. You want to play? No, no,
[5695.98s -> 5699.82s]  no, no, no, no. You guys are doing pretty sick. You guys are good. I don't play... I would never
[5699.82s -> 5705.55s]  play this. I would glance over and say, cool, and then I would never talk about it ever again.
[5714.94s -> 5725.74s]  Whatever. I don't... It doesn't matter. There. Now you... Okay, I have to restart. I gotta back away.
[5726.62s -> 5738.85s]  Okay, if we start over. Oh my god. Okay, what is the... What's the... I don't know. I know it's about
[5738.85s -> 5772.90s]  patience and I have none of that. Watch this spot down here. All right, you cannot go anywhere. I've
[5772.90s -> 5778.82s]  got you locked right here. Actually can't do anything. Cannot go anywhere. Now we close it in.
[5781.34s -> 5792.64s]  Slowly close it in. You can't go that way. All right, if you go up, you could take that out. If
[5792.64s -> 5855.01s]  you go up, you... All right. Slowly close it in. Okay. Okay, now... No! Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no.
[5855.01s -> 5864.58s]  I got it, I got it. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I don't... I fucking don't know. I fucked it up. It's okay.
[5864.58s -> 5894.98s]  You actually can't go anywhere. Okay, now... I got greedy. I win. I win. Not yet. I need to...
[5894.98s -> 5909.94s]  Did I win? But will... I think he'll just jump it. Won't he just jump it? Oh my god, what just
[5909.94s -> 5913.62s]  happened? I fucking hate this. I want to delete this so bad. I would flip the table at this point.
[5913.62s -> 5919.07s]  I don't know what just happened. I fucking hate this shit. I never play these. I avoid these like
[5919.07s -> 5924.35s]  the... I avoid them because I don't want to play these. I don't like... I don't play checkers,
[5924.35s -> 5927.47s]  I don't play chess. Everyone... I've had people ask me, oh, are you interested in playing chess?
[5927.47s -> 5932.35s]  No, zero. It's a big brains. A lot of brains involved. I'm not saying I have a small brain.
[5932.35s -> 5936.03s]  I'm just saying a very particular brain that does particular things pretty well. This is not one of
[5936.03s -> 5942.18s]  them. I had it. I... Dude, I know I had it. You know the guy who stabbed that? Don't save it.
[5943.06s -> 5951.14s]  Just quit and just start over. I hate these fucking things. It's not even hard. It's just like...
[5951.14s -> 5975.73s]  Yeah, I have to sit there and just like... I thought I just won. This game is best for an
[5975.81s -> 5995.34s]  ages nine and up. Yeah, I know at the age... I know the rating it has. Now I'm just fucking tilted.
[5995.34s -> 6004.02s]  I'm just... I don't want to be doing this. Okay, if we start over. Where's the part where I could
[6004.02s -> 6008.66s]  like sprint wicked fast for a few minutes? You know what I mean? Like where's that part?
[6012.10s -> 6074.43s]  I had it. I know. I just don't care. I just want to flip this. Fuck out of here. Now you're stuck
[6074.43s -> 6099.44s]  here. Now you're stuck here. Now I can bring everything down safely, right? Yes. Now I can
[6099.44s -> 6112.35s]  go down. We're good. Now this is where I screw it up. If I go down here, can't go left, but he can
[6112.35s -> 6121.33s]  go that way. So let me think about this. If I go down, it's going here, which means I had... This
[6121.33s -> 6130.85s]  one has to be here, right? I'm just planning this out. So if he goes here, I don't... So then this
[6130.85s -> 6139.01s]  one needs to be moved as well. We don't want to give him any opportunity. This means he cannot
[6139.01s -> 6147.68s]  go diagonal from here. So if I go down with this one, he can jump it. If I go down with this one
[6147.68s -> 6166.88s]  right now, he cannot. Save it right now. Oh, nice. So let's see what happens. Okay. I'm scared.
[6217.90s -> 6227.50s]  No! I saw it. I saw it the last second. I hate these fucking games. No, it doesn't let you cheat.
[6227.50s -> 6231.65s]  It doesn't let you cheat. It doesn't let you cheat. It doesn't... Oh my God. Why did I...
[6231.65s -> 6236.93s]  It's one little mistake. Just fucked the whole thing up. I hate this. I don't want to do this.
[6250.90s -> 6262.08s]  What went so wrong there? God damn it. Fuck you. I would never bring this to Friday night game night
[6262.08s -> 6299.76s]  ever. Where you going? Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that?
[6299.76s -> 6331.94s]  Why is he doing that? He can't go this way, right? Can he go this way? He cannot go this way. Can he?
[6331.94s -> 6354.70s]  No. No, no, no. Okay. Oh my God. I can't... Oh my God. I can't do it. I don't think I can do it,
[6354.78s -> 6360.22s]  guys. I don't think I can fucking do it. I think I have to literally get a save file from some fucking
[6360.22s -> 6374.67s]  random ass website. I fucking hate this more than anything. I hate this shit. I hate this shit.
[6374.67s -> 6380.00s]  I can't play these. I can't... I just don't have the... I just don't have... I could do it and I'm
[6380.00s -> 6385.58s]  going to shut the heck up and I'm going to beat it right now. Start the timer. We're not sitting
[6385.58s -> 6389.50s]  here anymore. I promise. All of you that are sitting there that are thinking, I can't believe
[6389.50s -> 6400.78s]  this guy... I can't believe this guy drives a car. I got you. Just relax. What would this have to do
[6400.78s -> 6433.01s]  with driving a car anyways? It's not like you do this when you stop at a stop sign. I can't do
[6433.01s -> 6445.14s]  anything. He's stuck. I can move this here and it's safe. No, I can't do that. Okay. Wait a minute.
[6445.14s -> 6452.27s]  What if I put him up here? No. Should I put him up there? Worst gamer moment. These things are
[6452.27s -> 6459.63s]  annoying and hard. I guarantee you. You sit... 90% of you down. You ain't going to beat this in five
[6459.63s -> 6483.30s]  minutes. What should I move? I just... I'm so paranoid that I'm going to just miss something.
[6483.94s -> 6489.71s]  I wonder if the other guy got up because he was kicking his ass for three straight days in a lodge
[6489.71s -> 6499.66s]  and that's all you guys can do is sit here. Oh my god. I can't even see it. I can't even comprehend
[6499.66s -> 6506.18s]  it. My brain is not wired to be able to understand how this game works in every single facet of it.
[6506.18s -> 6511.79s]  This is like the one... If a bomb was going to go off, get me out of this room. Don't give
[6511.79s -> 6534.69s]  this to me. It's not going to happen. God damn it. I fucking want to get out of here so bad.
[6534.69s -> 6543.90s]  Okay, we start over. It's so... It's not hard. It's just there are so many places to screw it up.
[6543.90s -> 6587.65s]  All right. I'm going to get it this time. All right. Trust me. That's safe. Everything is safe
[6587.65s -> 6596.94s]  if I do it here. There's nothing. You can jump over here so I can start closing the gap here.
[6596.94s -> 6603.18s]  As long as I move this and then the other one right behind it immediately.
[6603.26s -> 6619.95s]  Okay. You're stuck here. Same deal. Wait. I got to be aware of this. So move... What should I... I
[6619.95s -> 6632.34s]  don't know what to do first. Putting this here is free. It would ruin everything. So moving this
[6632.34s -> 6639.14s]  would have to see what he moves. If I put this here and he moves diagonal. I don't know. Maybe
[6639.14s -> 6648.45s]  I should move one of these down. This one down because then he has to go up and then from here
[6649.63s -> 6658.66s]  you've got nothing. You've got nothing. You've got nothing. So I can safely move this here
[6659.31s -> 6675.79s]  or this forward. You've got nothing. Okay. You've got... You've got nothing. This is coming down.
[6675.79s -> 6695.09s]  You've got nothing. This is coming down. You've got nothing. You've got nothing here. There's no
[6695.09s -> 6707.55s]  diagonal to here. So I can move this. You'll come down and you got nothing. By the way. You've got
[6707.55s -> 6719.86s]  nothing. All right. Now we come down with it. Right? Come down with this one and down with this one.
[6720.66s -> 6724.18s]  You've got no... You can't... You literally can't go anywhere. So just bring these ones down
[6724.18s -> 6738.51s]  where I can. All right. Now what? Now what? Should I try to do what I did before and just keep them
[6738.51s -> 6750.93s]  down here? Is that the right play? Keeping them down here. Is that the right play? All right.
[6750.93s -> 6757.17s]  We're solid right now. Actually has nowhere to go. Now I don't want to mess this up. And I'm going
[6757.17s -> 6770.18s]  to if I don't... I'm going to mess this up big time. If I put this one down then it's bad.
[6770.18s -> 6778.38s]  This one comes down it's over. This one comes down it's not over. If I put the middle one down.
[6778.38s -> 6786.96s]  If I put this down and he goes to the diagonal. I'm in trouble aren't I? I could have one move
[6786.96s -> 6796.45s]  to bring the one down which should save me. Right? Middle coming down blocks everything he's doing.
[6803.97s -> 6811.78s]  Now he can go... He can only go this way so I can block that here. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait,
[6811.78s -> 6819.33s]  wait, wait. Block that. He has to go back down. So he ends up here and I have these two. So you
[6819.33s -> 6825.47s]  end up right here with two here. He can't... If I go down then he'll go that way and I'm going to
[6825.47s -> 6839.60s]  bring another one down. Should I... Okay this one or the middle one? I'm not sure because I think
[6839.60s -> 6846.88s]  it's both scary. Or do I bring this down again? But that will I think open up too many opportunities.
[6846.88s -> 6860.16s]  I think I'm bringing the right one down. Okay. Then I'm bringing this one down that blocks him
[6860.16s -> 6864.08s]  so he can go right. He's going to go right. I'll block that. He's going to go right again.
[6864.08s -> 6871.15s]  I don't... I can't block it again. What? What? Hey what happened? What? What? Huh? Huh? Huh?
[6871.15s -> 6881.07s]  Excuse me. What's going on? What just happened? Why did it move? What just happened? Okay we're
[6881.07s -> 6894.30s]  fine. He went up. Bring middle down or do I bring this one down? If I bring this down here
[6894.30s -> 6907.18s]  then he has to go right. This is... I think this is correct. So many people don't know.
[6909.58s -> 6922.06s]  I don't want to mess this up. I swear. This one going down or this one come down? Bro he's
[6922.86s -> 6933.33s]  stupid. I just don't want to mess it up. I just don't want to screw it up. The top one,
[6933.33s -> 6942.10s]  this one comes down. That's what I was thinking. That's correct, right? Yes. That's what I would
[6942.10s -> 6948.42s]  have done. All right. Now I can't come down. I can't come down. We just have to start moving
[6948.42s -> 6957.33s]  other stuff down because if I move anything it's over. This has to come down. He's now...
[6957.33s -> 6986.42s]  She's trapped here. He can't do anything. This comes down. Ah! What? I'm safe as long as I'm
[6986.42s -> 6989.46s]  going to get everything in the right spot. If even it comes up here I can't... All right. Bring
[6989.46s -> 7008.34s]  everything down. Okay. All right. Now this comes down. If he moves to the right then I block it.
[7008.34s -> 7026.93s]  Right? Blocked. Blocked. Blocked. Wait. He's gonna move down. If I move this then he'll be
[7026.93s -> 7057.14s]  able to get that. Blocked. Blocked. Blocked. Blocked. Okay. Blocked. Now. I got him!
[7060.69s -> 7082.62s]  What just happened? Did I lose? Did I win? Did it take too long? He fell asleep.
[7086.67s -> 7102.99s]  It was optional. You have to win this three times. No, I don't. How about another game? No.
[7107.81s -> 7111.81s]  It's three games. No, it's not. I don't remember any of that. I would just watch the VOD.
[7112.45s -> 7120.50s]  It's just a side game. No, it's definitely not seven times. It's just optional. Well, I thought
[7120.50s -> 7123.78s]  he was gonna give me an item or something. All right. Well, now what the hell am I doing now?
[7126.77s -> 7132.29s]  Oh, now what? Well, sorry to bother you. You want to talk? You know where to find me.
[7138.59s -> 7158.58s]  Whatever. Well, okay. Fine. Now what? Oh, it's time for dinner. Oops. Oopsie. Um, okay. This is fun.
[7158.58s -> 7170.11s]  This is a fun game. Hope everyone's having a good time. I'm having a good time. I need to cook.
[7170.11s -> 7180.03s]  Where's the door? I have no object permanence. Nancy, Chantal's calling. Again?
[7180.83s -> 7196.08s]  Lunch. I'm never here. I'm never here to cook food. Oh, God. This is elaborate.
[7197.23s -> 7207.26s]  One salad with a bunch of bullshit in it. Oh, my goodness. Okay. What is salmon and or a salad.
[7207.26s -> 7212.94s]  Cook salmon on the griddle and remove when it turns bright orange pink. Put extra salad ingredients
[7212.94s -> 7220.18s]  in the salad bowl on top of the lettuce. All salads are to be topped with the Lodge's famous
[7220.18s -> 7225.49s]  Icicle Creek ranch dressing. What if somebody doesn't want ranch dressing? We just put it on
[7225.49s -> 7233.41s]  everything. Why would I? What if somebody says don't put any sauce on it? Do I say? I don't
[7233.41s -> 7254.37s]  care. I saw it comes. What do you want? One say, let's get this right. One salmon. Okay. Now you
[7254.37s -> 7259.41s]  want three egg, three. I'm going to have to look at this like five times. Don't want any anchovies
[7259.41s -> 7267.87s]  and no croutons. Three egg, three yellow peppers. Does all salad have lettuce? Which one? This is
[7267.87s -> 7277.65s]  lettuce. Does all salad have lettuce on it? Yeah. Okay. Three eggs, three yellow peppers, two
[7277.65s -> 7286.91s]  tomatoes. Three eggs. Dude, that's a lot of eggs. Three yellow peppers. That's kind of a fucked up
[7286.91s -> 7306.14s]  salad. Two tomatoes, two spinach, three carrots, three cucumbers. Okay. Here you go. Salad. Enjoy.
[7306.86s -> 7318.88s]  Order up. What do you want? Two salmons and then one salad with two egg and then a bunch of other
[7318.88s -> 7340.43s]  stuff. Two eggs, one yellow pepper, two tomato, two spinach, one anchovy, three carrots, three
[7340.43s -> 7355.31s]  cucumber, two croutons. Order up. What do you want? One salmon and one salad. What do you want on it?
[7355.39s -> 7367.79s]  Two egg, three yellow peppers. One, two, three. One tomato, one spinach, two anchovy, one carrot,
[7371.02s -> 7384.98s]  and three cucumber, two croutons. There you go. Order up. Just want a salad. Two egg, three yellow
[7384.98s -> 7428.96s]  peppers. I can't remember this. Okay, we're good. What do you want? Two egg, three yellow peppers.
[7428.96s -> 7444.93s]  One, two, three. Two tomatoes, two spinach. Okay. One carrot, one cucumber. Easy. And then three
[7444.93s -> 7457.30s]  croutons, right? Yeah. Order up. Are you de-boning the fish? No, I don't think so. All right. Two of
[7457.30s -> 7463.36s]  these. What do you want? Do you want any of that? All right. What? Put four on. You're both getting
[7463.36s -> 7479.84s]  salad. Yes, they're both getting salad. I put, oh, what just happened? All right. They're both
[7479.84s -> 7489.98s]  getting a salad. Did I just frisbee that? Where did that just go? All right. You're both getting
[7489.98s -> 7501.90s]  salads. You both want one egg, two yellow peppers, both two yellow peppers, one tomato, two tomato,
[7505.12s -> 7531.22s]  three spinach, one spinach, two anchovy, two carrot, one carrot. What was it? Three cucumbers,
[7531.22s -> 7543.76s]  two croutons. Two cucumbers, three croutons. What? Three cucumbers, two, um, what? Okay. Yours is done.
[7543.76s -> 7565.34s]  And then you wanted two. Order up. We're done. We're good. Okay. Very nice. Now I did that.
[7565.34s -> 7574.21s]  Everything's good. We were in the middle of trying to figure out what this is. Okay, we've got a
[7576.10s -> 7585.47s]  okay, it's a four. Wait, what's that? No, no, no. What is that on the wall? On the wall, on the wall,
[7585.47s -> 7591.46s]  on the wall. Come on. You're not going to do this to me right now. Come on to the wall. What's that?
[7591.46s -> 7605.34s]  No, we're in Canada. All right. What's Canadian? Canadian, um, hockey, maple syrup, um, trees,
[7605.34s -> 7626.91s]  mountains, snow, poutine. All right. We're good. Who cares? When do I get to go to sleep by the way?
[7626.91s -> 7641.98s]  Hmm. Should I go upstairs? I feel like people are in their rooms now. Let me see. Right. People in
[7641.98s -> 7661.25s]  their rooms or anything? No, I don't get it. We can name one human being who is not yourself. Um,
[7661.25s -> 7680.29s]  anymore? Why am I stuck here? What's going on? What do you want? You messed with my rifle,
[7680.29s -> 7686.69s]  didn't you? This I got to hear. What? Excuse me? This fact just came for you. It's from the
[7686.69s -> 7693.17s]  wacko left-wing wildlife gang that paid you to screw up my rifle so I'd miss that wolf.
[7693.17s -> 7698.93s]  Talk to me like that. I'm leaving this place right now. Good. You just got yourself an escort off
[7698.93s -> 7715.33s]  the premises. What happened? Hey, wait, wait. No, I'm the detective. Come talk to me. Wait.
[7715.33s -> 7728.43s]  I'm not going outside now. It's too cold. What the heck? That's for me. What? Nancy, because of that
[7728.43s -> 7732.99s]  Neanderthal of a handyman, I've been forced to return home. Please call me. When it comes
[7732.99s -> 7740.38s]  to the white wolf, there was much for us to talk about. All right. Let's call you on a secure line.
[7740.38s -> 7756.82s]  Two, one, three, five, five, five. Just do the two, one, three part. Two, one, three, three, two,
[7756.82s -> 7770.85s]  six, four. Two, one, three, three, two, six, four. What was it? Two, two, one, two, one, three,
[7770.85s -> 7797.31s]  three, two, six, four. What? Hi, this is Nancy Drew. I'll call you later. Oh, no. Call now.
[7797.95s -> 7841.87s]  What was it? Three, three, two, six, four. Still not there. Still not there. She just left. Give her
[7841.87s -> 7846.82s]  a few minutes. What am I going to do for a few minutes? I got to go talk to that guy.
[7851.73s -> 7873.54s]  Walking around. You hear that? Who's walking around? What you need? What's going on here?
[7873.54s -> 7878.26s]  I couldn't help but overhear the argument you and Miss Camille had. She messed up my
[7878.26s -> 7882.98s]  raffle so I couldn't shoot that wolf. So I tossed her out, told her to take her little crusade
[7882.98s -> 7889.95s]  somewhere else. Tell. Have you told Chantal that you threw her out? Chantal that? Not yet.
[7889.95s -> 7894.91s]  She's not going to be happy. But by golly, that woman was a menace. Anybody who deliberately
[7894.91s -> 7900.03s]  sabotage a man's rifle is capable of anything. But at least now I know why I miss that wolf.
[7900.27s -> 7905.23s]  And like I told her as I was giving her the bum's rush next time, I won't miss.
[7909.02s -> 7924.06s]  Oh, that's why you missed. Thumbs up some major copium. Oh, hasn't your rifle been?
[7925.63s -> 7932.66s]  I'd better get back upstairs. If you need anything, just holler.
[7932.66s -> 7937.76s]  Copium. Yeah, all of you guys would be saying no skill issue, skill issue.
[7938.64s -> 7985.82s]  All right. Can I call her now? Was it three, two, six, four? Still not there. So now what do I
[7985.82s -> 7993.82s]  got to do? I can't leave. I'm not going outside now. It's too cold. Call in the morning maybe.
[7994.62s -> 8004.14s]  Can I just go to bed? I feel like there's not much else I can do right now. Call 1555 Mystico
[8004.14s -> 8011.66s]  and prepare to be amazed. There's not even enough numbers on a keypad to type that in.
[8012.22s -> 8027.65s]  Whoever came up with that jingle. What are you talking about? Go call it? There's not even that
[8027.65s -> 8046.11s]  many numbers. That doesn't make any sense. What was it? Mystico, 1555, 1555, 1555, 1555, call
[8046.75s -> 8059.02s]  it. What is it? 1555, M, Y, S, T, I, C, O?
[8060.85s -> 8066.13s]  Who dares disturb the concentration of Mystico the Magnificent?
[8067.55s -> 8075.79s]  Um, I'm sorry. This is Nancy Drew. Nancy Drew, I see your future clear as tape.
[8075.79s -> 8084.43s]  I see. That's too many numbers. And a dark figure named Bruno. Bruno. Bruno? But beware,
[8084.43s -> 8092.75s]  Nancy Drew. The wolf will only lead to danger and intrigue. Cool. I mean, yes, Mystico.
[8093.39s -> 8098.11s]  The Magnificent. Huh? You're supposed to say Mystico the Magnificent.
[8099.07s -> 8107.39s]  Oh, right. Yes, Mystico the Magnificent. So Nancy Drew, what secrets from the beyond do you seek?
[8109.46s -> 8114.82s]  A hint. What do you think I am? An insurance salesman, a pair of underage
[8114.82s -> 8121.94s]  detectives, a star-struck teenager, a watch the police officer, an elderly housekeeper, a parrot?
[8123.14s -> 8131.38s]  You have incurred the wrath of Mystico. From this moment forward, bad luck shall creep behind you
[8131.38s -> 8139.01s]  like a malevolent shadow. Don't say that. Mystico has spoken. Now, why would you say that to me?
[8139.65s -> 8167.47s]  What the heck? Do that? People sad. Well, I'm just going to go to bed. Isn't this my room?
[8167.47s -> 8184.46s]  This is my room. This is my room. Where's my room? This is my room. Which one of these is mine?
[8184.46s -> 8218.67s]  Isn't it this one? It's the one that's locked. If you put your face cam on, we'll tell you.
[8220.34s -> 8228.10s]  You would like me to turn my face cam on, wouldn't you? Check my items.
[8230.86s -> 8239.81s]  Okay, I need to call her in the morning. It's this thing. I haven't seen any of these. I don't
[8239.81s -> 8247.41s]  know what that's trying to tell me. What is this? Oh, that's the fishing toolbox. I already did that.
[8247.41s -> 8261.41s]  Here's the bullet. I already called this. This is the book of things going on. I don't know.
[8277.22s -> 8282.54s]  What about her room? I'm going up to her room because, okay, she just got like kicked out,
[8282.54s -> 8294.18s]  right? Maybe she left something behind? I don't know. What was the word I said again?
[8294.18s -> 8328.61s]  Oh, lolly. Did he leave something behind? I mean, it's 730 at night. It's getting kind of late.
[8328.61s -> 8341.41s]  I can't leave, so there's got to be something I can do here. This is weird, too. What is this?
[8341.41s -> 8347.74s]  Why does it want me to look at this? 730 isn't late. Well, it's late enough where I can't leave
[8347.74s -> 8371.02s]  the lodge. I need to get the snowshoes. How do I get the snowshoes from him? I don't get it.
[8377.47s -> 8379.63s]  I can talk to this guy again.
[8387.60s -> 8394.80s]  Do you have no other dialogue? No. What about the sauna? The sauna's just hanging out here.
[8394.80s -> 8401.71s]  Is there anything I can do with the sauna? I don't know. What's this for?
[8401.95s -> 8426.11s]  I don't know. Lala or pre-recorded. That's the worst way to get me to do that.
[8428.08s -> 8457.34s]  Save the game. This is the first game that I ever played. It's a good one, so I can't leave.
[8460.14s -> 8474.72s]  So I have to call that number. You're just not available. Go to bed? I can't. I can't go to sleep.
[8476.83s -> 8498.13s]  Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.
[8498.13s -> 8532.61s]  Oh, it's closed, though. What do I do? Are these symbols in the... Wait a minute. What about that
[8532.61s -> 8538.99s]  device that's sitting on the table? Where is it? With the wolf face and this thing. Have I not
[8538.99s -> 8544.21s]  figured out what the hell this means yet? I have to know what is going on here, right? I have to
[8544.21s -> 8570.11s]  know what this means. What is this? You know what I'm saying? There's nothing under the table.
[8570.11s -> 8584.58s]  What about that symbol note? Yeah, but what... Okay, is there... Do the animals have symbols
[8584.58s -> 8609.42s]  next to them somewhere? I think it means... I'm not reading that. It's the Saga of the White Wolf.
[8609.42s -> 8618.88s]  Don't forget. Yeah, I know. So what? What does that mean? What does that mean? Why are you saying
[8618.88s -> 8628.19s]  that? Why are you putting that in quotes? Don't forget. It's the Saga of the White Wolf. Why are
[8628.19s -> 8655.26s]  you saying that? What's that? Is that a book? Is that a book up here? Where are the books? How do
[8655.26s -> 8687.33s]  I go to sleep? Skip. I'm trying not to spin in circles. Go that way. Who had that book? Saga of
[8687.33s -> 8717.66s]  the Winter Sports Monthly. The Call of the Wild. That's not it. I thought this was going to be it.
[8717.66s -> 8737.71s]  Where is it? It's the Saga of the White Wolf. Damn it. I don't know where to go. Engineering,
[8738.27s -> 8750.00s]  geology, machines. Wait, what was that crumpled up piece of paper? It's all totally unfair and
[8750.00s -> 8754.98s]  I'm sick of putting up with things that aren't fair. It's his fault, her fault, their fault,
[8755.06s -> 8760.58s]  but I don't have what's rightfully mine. They are thieves and it's an insult to have what they
[8760.58s -> 8767.50s]  stole from us waved around in my face. I could throttle them, both of them, for what they did.
[8767.50s -> 8781.36s]  Justice shall be served one day. One day I will have justice. Whose room is this? Pish one? Pish
[8781.36s -> 8805.76s]  Pish is who? Bill Kessler. Okay, Bill, that's your room. Snowshoes on the ground? Are those snowshoes?
[8805.76s -> 8815.47s]  I don't think I can look down and get them. Other room? Those are slippers, dude.
[8816.13s -> 8826.03s]  Just get out there in slippers. God damn it. Where am I going? Okay, I need to fucking focus
[8826.03s -> 8833.07s]  for one goddamn second. The same shit happens to me in Myst when it's just pictures. Instead of
[8833.07s -> 8843.02s]  actually moving, my brain does not let me put it into memory. This is Bill's room. No, this is my
[8843.02s -> 8872.40s]  room. Whose fucking room is this? Where are the snowshoes? Get them. I can't pick them up. I can't
[8872.40s -> 8907.34s]  touch them. No stealing. I've been walking around in a simulated hour. Please lala into your
[8907.34s -> 8926.80s]  microphone. Need to check the den? What the fuck is this? What are these? Snowshoes. I thought
[8926.80s -> 8952.99s]  these were tennis rackets. Wait a minute. Do I have something here? What's this? How do I get that?
[8952.99s -> 8965.79s]  Heat and moisture sometimes cause the door of the sauna to stick. Periodically check to make sure
[8965.79s -> 9000.37s]  that no guests are inside. What? That sounds pretty bad. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[9000.37s -> 9010.67s]  She was full of shit. There are no eagles in the winter. There are no orioles in the winter.
[9010.67s -> 9033.65s]  She's a liar. Not watching birds at all. There's booze in that. Don't we already know that she
[9033.65s -> 9042.99s]  wasn't bird watching? She told us. Interesting. That's right. Good detectives always stick together
[9042.99s -> 9056.35s]  by the tens of thousands. So, you know, you know, I'll work on a case with me to get there. Imagine
[9056.35s -> 9072.90s]  being a detective and having fucking twitch chat. Oh my god. What a fucking nightmare. All right. I
[9072.90s -> 9077.46s]  need to figure out how to get these. It's a four digit code. What's the code? Like is it a number?
[9077.46s -> 9089.81s]  It's numbers. Okay. You know, I've seen, I've seen this number in the chat. Drew Crew spammed this so
[9089.81s -> 9100.38s]  he opens it. I think this is cheating. The Drew Crew wants me to hurry up and finish this. I mean,
[9100.38s -> 9104.54s]  I'm, I'm, I can't pretend like I haven't seen the number like a thousand times.
[9109.60s -> 9122.69s]  Everybody's writing this. It's four. It's. Oh, now they're fucking it all up. Okay.
[9127.97s -> 9135.09s]  Drew Crew spammed this so he sees. It's not even real. I'm going to get it on my own. Okay. And by
[9135.09s -> 9143.44s]  on my own, I mean, I want you to help me get there. I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions
[9143.44s -> 9153.71s]  and I would like for you to answer them. I am the detective. I'm asking you. It's time for your
[9153.71s -> 9170.19s]  questioning. You've looked at that dog breath. I feel like that sometimes. Oh, check on somebody,
[9170.19s -> 9178.90s]  dude. I think the balls are stuck to the bottom. I think we're okay, man. Nice talking to you.
[9178.90s -> 9192.34s]  Been real. What's up? Nice talking to you. Ditto, dude. It's something with this, right? But I don't
[9192.34s -> 9198.80s]  know. I need the snowshoes. I got to figure out what that because this is telling me what the code
[9198.80s -> 9207.73s]  is, but that where are their numbers? Are there numbers somewhere that I've like with symbols
[9207.73s -> 9218.14s]  next to them? Cause I don't, I don't know what this would be next to the numbers are on the note.
[9220.11s -> 9255.76s]  This is not, these are symbols. It's mirrored. What are you talking about? This is a four,
[9256.72s -> 9280.93s]  a one, an eight, a nine. What do you mean? It's mirrored. How does he not see it? It's guys.
[9282.05s -> 9294.64s]  Hold on. Seven, nine, one, four. But I know, but I thought this, but I'll buy it. Hold on a second.
[9294.64s -> 9302.53s]  Hold on a second. I get that. But what I'm looking for is I see this shit all over the place. I see
[9302.53s -> 9308.06s]  these. Hold on a minute. Like I saw, I saw like this triangle and I was like, okay, triangle,
[9308.06s -> 9316.83s]  maybe that's like, hold on. I'm looking for symbols that I have a number. I forgot this game was made
[9316.83s -> 9336.27s]  for children. Okay. Well not adults too. We can enjoy these for everybody. What was it? Seven,
[9336.27s -> 9347.55s]  one, seven, nine. What is it? What is it? Seven, nine, eight, seven, nine, one, four. That's not
[9347.55s -> 9360.24s]  correct. That's incorrect. That's incorrect. You guys don't have it right. Seven, nine, one,
[9360.24s -> 9383.38s]  four is incorrect. Seven, nine, one, four. Four, one, nine, seven. What's happening right now?
[9383.38s -> 9399.86s]  Because I don't think this is right. You guys are all wrong. Four, one, write it correctly. Four, one,
[9405.79s -> 9421.18s]  that's not correct. You guys got it wrong. Seven, nine, one, four. Drew. Yeah. The Drew crew has
[9421.18s -> 9446.70s]  failed. Keep it in mind. That's a shoelace. Seven, nine, one, four. So what's, what's going on here?
[9446.70s -> 9469.70s]  Is it like an accept button? Press enter. If that's for something else then. Well,
[9469.70s -> 9486.72s]  shit. That might be for the suitcase. Maybe it's backwards. Yeah. I'll put it in. I just did it
[9486.72s -> 9506.83s]  backwards too. Maybe a year. Not like 19, 1940s, 1947. Would it be a year? I don't know. I don't
[9506.83s -> 9514.11s]  know. No, it's definitely, that's for something else. Read the plaque.
[9514.11s -> 9522.80s]  Snowshoes owned and used by Trapper Dan in the early 1900s. Right. That didn't work. What about
[9522.80s -> 9552.59s]  1974? No. What about seven? Hold on. Seven, six. No, that's not going to be a six. That's nine.
[9552.59s -> 9579.18s]  Oh wait. I'm going to call the number. Still not there. It's a six. Oh my God. I'm dying. You think
[9579.18s -> 9605.90s]  it's a six? So it would be seven, seven, six, one, four. Time that person up for one second.
[9605.90s -> 9622.21s]  Look at the wall. Oh my God. Hold on. Trapper Dan started construction of what is known today
[9622.21s -> 9629.86s]  as the Ice Creek in 1894. It served as his center of operations until the winter of 1921.
[9629.86s -> 9637.86s]  When he vanished without a trace in 1934, the lodge was purchased by Abe Wentworth who maintained
[9637.86s -> 9674.66s]  it as a hunting lodge until, okay, 1894. 1934. 19, let's just write 19, 19, 1934. 19, 1930. I don't
[9674.66s -> 9723.20s]  know. 1980. You're wrong. All of you. All of you are wrong. Seven, six, six, nine. You're wrong too.
[9757.94s -> 9770.43s]  At some point, who's coming over here and going, Nancy, what are you doing over there?
[9770.43s -> 9790.00s]  Call the number. I just did. You have to call Tino. What the fuck? Tino, are you awake?
[9790.64s -> 9810.43s]  I need help. I think that'll do it. Thanks, Tino. Can't I just be like, what's the code for the
[9810.43s -> 9816.70s]  snowshoes? Cause I need them. Why is this so difficult? Can I, can somebody get me snowshoes?
[9816.70s -> 9841.50s]  Hi, Chantal. It's Nancy Drew. Not quite yet. This is a lot of questions. How come the entries for
[9841.50s -> 9848.34s]  last year were deleted from the guest register? That's what the computer says. Contents deleted.
[9848.34s -> 9870.34s]  Well, I didn't. Okay. Ollie's daughter? Has she done other things like that? No. I think that's
[9870.34s -> 9874.82s]  only in movies. Besides, pretty much all this person had to do was press the delete key.
[9874.82s -> 9895.31s]  Maybe it was on the kid? I'd like to know more about the accidents. I asked Ollie, but he said
[9895.31s -> 9930.58s]  you said he wasn't allowed to talk about them. The guest server. Okay. I'm not listening. I'm
[9930.58s -> 9963.42s]  not paying any attention by the way. But the only incidents that you can be sure were sabotage were
[9963.42s -> 9968.06s]  the tires, the phone wires, and maybe the explosion in the bunkhouse. I gotta send this. I gotta do
[9968.06s -> 9984.61s]  the survey. Where's the survey? I better get back to work. No, I had to go. No, I had to go. Don't
[9984.61s -> 9988.69s]  one-up me. Don't one-up me during our conversation. Hey, I'm wicked busy. You got a lot of stuff going
[9988.69s -> 9993.09s]  on. I'm out of here. Oh, I'm actually wicked busy too. Yeah. I was just about to leave. No, I was.
[9993.09s -> 10009.33s]  You weren't. I was about to leave. Okay. How do I fill out this survey? Is it on the computer
[10009.33s -> 10040.50s]  or something? Like where's the survey? In your inventory. No, it's not. What kind of weird social?
[10040.50s -> 10054.32s]  I'm just kidding. I don't actually think that. Or does he? All right. So I don't have this thing
[10054.32s -> 10083.68s]  you're talking about. Let's see. Get the guest survey. I was, when I just talked. Give me the
[10083.68s -> 10100.13s]  survey. Hi, it's Nancy Drew. Yes, but he said no. Darn. I can't. There's nobody. I just talked.
[10100.13s -> 10106.11s]  There's no guest. The guests that are in the lodge now. Did any of them stay here last year?
[10106.11s -> 10127.09s]  About Tino. About Tino. I'm not totally comfortable with the idea of consulting with him on this case.
[10127.09s -> 10152.62s]  Okay. Do you know what he did when we were on that train trip Laurie Gerard arranged?
[10152.62s -> 10175.36s]  Understood. Anything else? No. I better get back to work. I have to get going too. Go outside? I can't.
[10175.36s -> 10183.22s]  It won't let me. It's too cold apparently. Carrying this laundry bag around is a pain. I need to dump
[10183.22s -> 10188.90s]  it down. Why do I have the laundry bag at 10 o'clock at night? Who told me to pick this up?
[10188.90s -> 10215.26s]  If I go outside now, I'll freeze. I can't do anything. Go to bed? I don't think I can go to bed.
[10215.26s -> 10222.27s]  I'm just trapped. I can? I was in my room and I couldn't click on my bed.
[10222.91s -> 10240.21s]  Get me the hell out of here. Which is, which my room again? I better wait until this do not disturb
[10240.21s -> 10249.28s]  sign is gone. I better wait until this do not disturb sign is gone. Where's my room? This is my
[10249.28s -> 10275.57s]  bedroom. What just hit me in the head? Why is it, I woke up at one o'clock in the morning?
[10275.57s -> 10287.02s]  Now it's 1 p.m. I missed, I missed serving breakfast. Oh god. Just hold on. True though.
[10287.02s -> 10292.78s]  How often does that happen? All the time. I gotta, I gotta go to food. As long as it's not time to
[10292.78s -> 10301.07s]  cook, I might as well stay out of the kitchen. All right. Now I can finally leave. I'm gonna call
[10301.07s -> 10317.10s]  that number. What was it? One, three, three, two, six. I've memorized it by this point.
[10317.10s -> 10325.60s]  Ms. Camillo, hi. It's Nancy Drew from Icicle Creek Lodge. Yes. Well, Ollie hasn't succeeded in
[10325.60s -> 10367.25s]  shooting or trapping it yet, if that's what you mean. It scares me. The wolf scares me.
[10367.25s -> 10371.65s]  When I was trapped out on the lake without a coat, it dragged one to the shore and left it there for
[10371.65s -> 10402.88s]  me. It may have sensed you were in trouble. It is? Wolves and humans simca dog may mask that reason
[10402.88s -> 10408.48s]  no matter how sociable the wolf may appear. Instinct can at any moment rear its ugly head
[10408.48s -> 10414.40s]  with devastating results for any humans involved and for the wolf, especially for the wolf. It
[10414.40s -> 10422.42s]  will have simply been doing what comes naturally. Don't go up to wild animals like it's a Disney
[10422.42s -> 10433.57s]  movie. I think we've, I think we could all agree on that. So the fact that this wolf doesn't seem
[10433.57s -> 10438.13s]  to be that afraid of people could lead people to think they don't have to be afraid of it.
[10440.29s -> 10466.54s]  He's so brave. Oh, shit. I get the picture. I was talking about throwing raw turkeys to it,
[10466.54s -> 10475.58s]  right? That's my bad. Yeah, I was talking about somehow giving it raw turkeys and stuff, right?
[10475.58s -> 10483.01s]  I was like, oh, I'll just throw raw turkey at it. Yeah, that's a good idea, Jeremy. Bad idea.
[10483.01s -> 10486.45s]  Are you the one who wrecked all the gear that was in the fishing shack?
[10486.45s -> 10508.59s]  Yes, I have to bring the stream warning back. Oh, yeah. Do not attempt anything you see or hear
[10508.59s -> 10518.82s]  here. All this is to be never attempted. It's a it's a stream based around comedy and there's
[10518.82s -> 10524.69s]  some things that you hear that you do not be said again or to be attempted. I forgot about that.
[10524.69s -> 10528.05s]  Yeah, I got to have that like take up the whole entire it's going to be a watermark across the
[10528.05s -> 10539.62s]  entire image. When you were here at the lodge, how come you had a magazine that featured
[10540.58s -> 10574.67s]  in your room? You know, actually, nevermind. Why didn't you just come out and tell the people
[10574.67s -> 10601.66s]  at Icicle Creek Lodge that you were there to protect the wolf? I didn't even ask. I need to
[10601.66s -> 10619.63s]  get back to work. I'm getting back to work. We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
[10619.63s -> 10639.12s]  Please check the number and dial again. Recording. Now I can take the test. He's saying hi,
[10639.12s -> 10658.37s]  it's Nancy Drew. I'm glad you called. Actually, it was more like Ollie threw her out. Well,
[10658.37s -> 10668.86s]  hold on. Hold on a second. We just spoke and what I can I can just accuse. I can just accuse
[10668.86s -> 10687.14s]  automatically. Now call Tino. Bad friend. Yeah, we just became really good friends. I can now.
[10688.29s -> 10701.18s]  Yeah, but don't betray. Don't betray. I don't think so. We don't know the only we still have
[10701.18s -> 10730.38s]  to come up with proof. And now that's it for now. Now we call Tino. She gets us the survey.
[10730.38s -> 10747.65s]  I think that'll do it. Nevermind. All right. Now what the hell do I do? What do I do now?
[10747.65s -> 10758.82s]  You have to go back to Avalanche Ridge to trigger her recognizing she needs the shoes.
[10758.82s -> 10765.31s]  Didn't I already do that? I already did that. Yeah. She was like, oh, I can't go anywhere
[10765.31s -> 10775.46s]  further without snowshoes. And I kept walking and she died. Go to Avalanche Creek. You die.
[10776.10s -> 10805.25s]  You died. Avalanche Creek, not Ridge. Where's Avalanche Creek? Avalanche Ridge. Okay. Now
[10806.05s -> 10814.16s]  the snow so deep I'm sinking to my knees. Okay. If I want to follow those tracks,
[10814.80s -> 10826.56s]  gonna need some snowshoes. Turn around. I need snowshoes. If I don't get warm soon.
[10826.56s -> 10836.22s]  Oh my God. And now I'm gonna die. I don't have any more hand warmers.
[10842.94s -> 10870.83s]  I feel warmer already. All right. Now where do I get the snowshoes? You. Now call. I need snowshoes.
[10870.83s -> 10881.06s]  Where do I get them? It's Nancy. Listen, I think I'm on to something, but I desperately need
[10881.06s -> 10885.22s]  snowshoes. Could you give me the combination to the lock on the display case so I could use
[10885.22s -> 10914.54s]  the ones in there? Sure. What do you want me to do? I can't believe it. I'm just gonna write
[10914.54s -> 10927.46s]  random information. Sounds good. Excellent. As we speak. Great. I just hope the questions aren't
[10927.46s -> 10948.67s]  too dumb. Got it. Good. Okay. Nothing else to report. Don't let me down. Which side of the bed
[10949.31s -> 10998.62s]  does S get up from? Yeah, Pluto. Didn't answer. Actually, I was supposed to spill coffee on this
[10998.62s -> 11037.12s]  one. Neptune. This is two states. I don't know. The right side? What side of the bed? Left? I
[11037.12s -> 11045.20s]  don't know. And then left? All right. It's filled out. Done. That was fun. Backs it over. I can't
[11045.20s -> 11049.52s]  send this yet. First, I have to call Tino and tell him to turn his machine on. Turn your machine
[11049.52s -> 11104.94s]  on. I sure am. Huh? You bet. I better go. God damn it. I have to go interview people now.
[11104.94s -> 11136.02s]  Speedrun. They're not even here. Who do I need? I need to, okay. G, C, L, T, B, K, and Y, V.
[11136.02s -> 11150.80s]  Let's go talk to Bill down here, right? Before I forget, Chantal called. Told me I can answer any
[11150.80s -> 11155.57s]  questions you might have about those accidents after all. Guess she changed her mind. Okay.
[11155.57s -> 11159.89s]  How do you explain what happened to Carl Jenkins, the former guest who slipped on the stairs and
[11159.89s -> 11165.25s]  broke his leg? Can't explain it. One minute those stairs were clear and dry. Next minute they're
[11165.25s -> 11175.68s]  slick with ass and he's lying at the bottom of them. What's going on with my game? Okay. You're
[11175.68s -> 11180.48s]  positive they were clear and dry? Yep. Chipped every bit of frozen snow off of them. Oh, they
[11180.48s -> 11183.60s]  have the answers in the chat right now. You ask me. Fuck it. I don't care. Somebody ice those stairs
[11183.60s -> 11189.84s]  down on purpose because it wasn't nothing I did. No, sir. No, sir. I'll get out of your hair now.
[11190.08s -> 11193.84s]  By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were cleaned,
[11193.84s -> 11199.12s]  so I put it back up at the front desk. He's cheating. Yeah, but this mission is literally,
[11199.12s -> 11203.44s]  I just have to talk to people and get their answers. We can write, I already know them.
[11203.44s -> 11235.92s]  What is this? Do I have to spell the whole thing out? It's that, right? I don't care. I genuinely do
[11235.92s -> 11239.04s]  not. I don't care. I know people are saying, oh my God, what? I can't believe you're cheating
[11239.04s -> 11244.46s]  right now. This is, this is going to take us like an hour. This is like a gigantic fetch quest. I
[11244.46s -> 11253.81s]  don't care. I'll copy somebody's paper. This is the kind of stuff I don't, you know, this is,
[11253.81s -> 11259.14s]  I don't need to do this detective work. We already got detectives here. What planet was this one?
[11259.14s -> 11279.92s]  Just search the rooms. I just, I just pretend I did. I'm disappointed. I, I, I'm telling you,
[11279.92s -> 11290.30s]  you're not. I know you're not. You're not disappointed. I know you're not disappointed.
[11290.30s -> 11294.29s]  You cheated not only the game, but yourself. I know. That's fine. You can, don't spam that
[11294.29s -> 11299.78s]  for at least a minute though, cause I can read. Why are you even playing this game? This is the
[11299.78s -> 11312.02s]  only time I've done this. This is the one time I decided to do this. You're letting down the
[11312.02s -> 11317.73s]  Drew crew. The Drew crew. I, I'm just, I mean, I'm just saying that we have revitalized the
[11317.73s -> 11321.33s]  Drew crew the last couple of days. Yeah. There's no way it's disappointing. All right. Let me get
[11321.33s -> 11363.04s]  this right. All right. So that is earth. Wait, what earth? No. Okay. Lou is Venus. Okay. Yes.
[11363.04s -> 11378.26s]  Okay. Okay. Wolf. Yes. How many people is that? That's probably people mad at me.
[11378.82s -> 11406.37s]  It's all right. Okay. Okay. No. Okay. What is this one? That? Okay. I didn't get any of these
[11406.37s -> 11431.14s]  right even accidentally. Hey, look at that. I did it. All right. Yeah. Let's fax that over.
[11431.14s -> 11481.98s]  Turn yours on. I sure did. You messed it up. Oh my God. What was wrong with it? Oh, wrong club.
[11482.62s -> 11499.09s]  X. I know. Do it over. Not in Venus. So somebody was lying to me in the chat. Planet X. You know
[11499.09s -> 11508.06s]  how painful that would have been. All of us know that we want to avoid me opening the same three
[11508.06s -> 11516.30s]  doors 10 times over the course of 40 minutes. Right? I mean, I'm just telling you. Yep. Just
[11516.30s -> 11546.29s]  saving us a little time. No problem. I think that'll do it. That's both right. Right. Is it
[11546.29s -> 11565.06s]  because I like have, is it capital and don't do capital letters? Maybe Angeles earth earth
[11568.96s -> 11583.79s]  isn't random. I spell it wrong. It's Planet X. You're doing the shitty lying voice. No, I swear.
[11583.79s -> 11598.24s]  I promise you. I'm looking at a screenshot right now. Is this correct? This is wrong. Spelling,
[11598.24s -> 11642.58s]  spelling, spelling. You have to say Planet X. Like that. Planet X. Yeah. Let's try that. Yep.
[11642.58s -> 11653.09s]  Okay. Come on, man. What the hell? But Bill Kessler likes to ice fish. Guadalupe Camillo is the one
[11653.09s -> 11658.61s]  who likes to bird watch. Yanni Valksdaya is a champion skier and Lou Talbot likes to snowshoe.
[11658.61s -> 11668.74s]  That's right. But you were kind of right. I mean, you did pretty much describe everyone at the lodge.
[11679.23s -> 11700.93s]  There we go. Finally. Finally. Yes. To the display case. What is it? So what is the point
[11700.93s -> 11707.09s]  of that paper with the seven and the four? What was that even for the mirror? That does it for now.
[11707.09s -> 11732.38s]  I mean, these damn things did it. I did that number already, but I had to do all that bullshit
[11732.38s -> 11737.44s]  first. Okay. I got the snowshoes. Now we're going back out of the ridge. I'm going to walk on the
[11737.44s -> 11784.94s]  ice. I'm going to go get a, let me get the hand warmer. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Now I have to
[11784.94s -> 11815.63s]  go not that way. Not that way. Not that way. This way. Snowshoes. See what's really going on here.
[11815.63s -> 11838.08s]  Now what's really going on? What happened to my snow thing? I just took it. Are you kidding me?
[11838.08s -> 11861.94s]  I just guess I saw off lock myself. What's going on? I'm starting to get really cold.
[11861.94s -> 11869.33s]  I can't stop shivering. I need to get in out of the cold. Looks like some kind of house.
[11869.33s -> 11876.45s]  Could someone be living? Hello. Is anyone here? Fuck. Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11876.45s -> 11891.10s]  This is it. What is it? This is definitely it. It's what was it? Mirrored seven nine. All right.
[11891.10s -> 11904.53s]  We're in a weird book. The rest of my life by Julius McQuade. I'm not reading all this.
[11904.53s -> 11914.16s]  I'm not reading all this. No way. I don't know. It's too long. So once I get her attention by
[11914.16s -> 11930.24s]  saying her name, I can give her commands. I got to pick this up. Maybe I'll write in it.
[11930.24s -> 11935.76s]  Okay. Now I miss somebody. I feel like I'm hiking around. I have to write to somebody,
[11935.76s -> 11941.50s]  even it's my cell phone. Maybe probably not. I'm tired of writing these down. Tired of feeling
[11941.50s -> 11947.39s]  caged like an animal. I spent 40 years of working with three hours. The train will reach
[11947.39s -> 11952.19s]  Edmonton. Maybe I'll get off. Maybe I won't. I don't know. The next day I woke up in my tent
[11952.19s -> 11958.14s]  to the sound of distant gunshots this morning. Later I found my wolf pup is all by herself.
[11958.14s -> 11965.98s]  Stuck in a lunch. I figured out the hunting got him and mother since she was nowhere else around.
[11965.98s -> 11973.66s]  And since there is no way whatever extra extricate herself, I started shopping through the brambles
[11973.66s -> 11979.94s]  to free her. It took me a while though. And I was talking to her all the time, trying to keep her
[11979.94s -> 11985.54s]  from struggling and hurting herself. So what I was really doing without meaning to was
[11985.54s -> 11992.64s]  imprinting my voice and my scent on her brain. Because at first she went racing off, but then
[11992.64s -> 11996.80s]  later I noticed that she was following me. Even now she's sitting about 20 yards away,
[11996.80s -> 12003.18s]  despite my campfire. Just watching me. I haven't fed her. I avoided touching her while I was cutting
[12003.18s -> 12008.02s]  her free from the brambles, yet she's there. So since this could be the beginning of an
[12008.02s -> 12014.74s]  inter-sting relationship, I thought maybe I should take some notes. Old habits of one indeed,
[12014.74s -> 12020.59s]  whatever. A week went by. The pup whose coat is pure white still shadows me wherever I go.
[12020.59s -> 12025.49s]  Every day she narrows the distance between us, which has been reduced to about 20 feet. If I
[12025.49s -> 12030.46s]  get any closer she runs. Another like month went by. The pup which has been, I've been calling,
[12032.22s -> 12037.66s]  now keeps no less than seven feet between us at all times. Distance which I am happy as well. I've
[12037.66s -> 12042.62s]  watched her hunt for food, have seen what she can do with her teeth and jaws, and have no desire
[12042.62s -> 12048.70s]  to even encounter either on a personal basis. I have revisited the urge to feed her, to make her
[12048.70s -> 12053.82s]  in any way dependent on me, but I do talk to her. I can't help myself. I've discovered that talking
[12053.82s -> 12062.16s]  in a very basic human need, way, why, is a first listens and I don't know, but then she's something
[12062.16s -> 12071.17s]  happens. A month went by. Snow has began to fall. I've moved into an alarming dome storage,
[12071.17s -> 12076.98s]  but I found it's a little too close, but I don't care. All right, so the dog had a friend.
[12082.05s -> 12086.21s]  Hey, are there any plumbers in chat? I took apart my shower head and now I'm confused.
[12086.21s -> 12091.01s]  I've been there before and it sucks. I've actually been there before and it kind of sucks,
[12091.01s -> 12101.52s]  trying to figure out what to do with it. Yeah, I've been there. I've been there, man. It sucks.
[12101.97s -> 12105.17s]  Just, I don't know, at this point, just turn off, turn the water off and just call somebody
[12105.17s -> 12112.67s]  that knows what they're doing. That's what I do. Like it or not, I've become hers. I'm not at all
[12113.39s -> 12120.67s]  sure which, while she is never underfoot, referring to remain at least three feet away from me most
[12120.67s -> 12126.02s]  of the time, she does permit and occasionally seeks out a friendly pat or two on the head and
[12127.23s -> 12132.56s]  shoulders. Although like most dogs, she doesn't seem to consider my touch to be any kind of reward.
[12132.56s -> 12140.08s]  In fact, I sometimes feel that by letting me pet her, she's rewarding me. Like three months,
[12140.08s -> 12147.98s]  four months have gone by. With the coming of the spring, I fully expect Isis to take off one day
[12147.98s -> 12156.50s]  and never return, but so far that hasn't happened. She appears for hours at a time. No doubt to hunt,
[12156.50s -> 12161.31s]  but for some reason she always returns. Another month. Last night, a wolf started howling in the
[12161.31s -> 12169.41s]  distance. Isis sat bolt upright, jolted, and listened to my hand she was shaking when howling
[12169.41s -> 12174.29s]  ended. After a moment, she lay back down and went back to sleep. I suddenly realized that she's not
[12174.29s -> 12184.06s]  going to leave. Even it was either the wilderness or me and incredibly she chose me. This is like
[12184.06s -> 12190.98s]  another year. Isis is by far the smartest animal I have ever seen by watching her carefully and
[12190.98s -> 12203.47s]  reinforcing the commands. I could have just turned to this page and said that I can give
[12203.47s -> 12215.49s]  commands. Down, forward, jump, stay, bark, paw, left, right, around. I can give Isis not just
[12215.49s -> 12220.53s]  one command, but many commands chained in a row and she'll carry them out one by one in order.
[12220.53s -> 12226.54s]  I start with a chain of commands by saying Isis and I end the chain by saying go.
[12227.81s -> 12232.99s]  Ability to sort objects by scent. There's nobody reading this. She has an object in her mouth,
[12232.99s -> 12238.51s]  she'll sniff, then drop the object near another object that has the same scent.
[12238.51s -> 12255.30s]  Pinevale Hospital. Okay. Uh oh. Sit, sit, sit, stay. Where's the turkey? Where's my raw turkey?
[12255.30s -> 12275.98s]  Isis, stay. Okay. Isis, jump. Jump, paw, left, right, jump, down. I'm going to stop here.
[12276.83s -> 12282.59s]  Isis, jump, paw, left, right, jump, down, go.
[12298.64s -> 12308.99s]  Jump, jump, down, down, left, right. I'm going to stop here. I can't do the Konami code.
[12308.99s -> 12319.82s]  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump. I'm going to stop. Isis, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
[12319.90s -> 12342.93s]  go. Wow. Bark, bark, bark, bark. I'm going to Isis, bark, bark, bark, bark, around, around, go.
[12347.46s -> 12356.80s]  So stupid. Why are we doing this? I mean, this is a really smart, intelligent dog. It seems like a
[12356.80s -> 12367.47s]  really great animal, but like, what, why am I, am I going to go out this way or what? Forward,
[12368.03s -> 12383.49s]  Isis, forward, forward, forward, forward, forward, go. Okay. So now how about, okay. So left, left,
[12383.49s -> 12399.15s]  left out the door. Okay. So left, left, left again, left, and then forward, forward and then
[12399.15s -> 12406.75s]  down, down. Like, what does that do? Isis, left, left, forward, down, go. Who's left? My left?
[12406.75s -> 12415.26s]  No, that's, that's okay. That's Isis's left. So right. So you need to go right, forward, down,
[12416.06s -> 12431.60s]  bark. Okay. So I think I want her to go out here, right? Get rid of this. Right, forward, down.
[12431.60s -> 12452.69s]  What does that do? Isis, right, forward, down, go. Right, forward, down. Wonder what this is.
[12452.69s -> 12464.29s]  Looks like there's a phone number on it. Call it. This is just practice. Oh, what's that?
[12464.29s -> 12468.77s]  This indentation looks just like the one on that plaque in the lodge where that missing Rex
[12468.77s -> 12479.41s]  bone used to be. A little bro distracted by Bop It. Okay. Well, that's, I guess that's how it is.
[12479.41s -> 12487.23s]  If I try to walk back to the lodge now, I'll freeze. I better stay here for the night.
[12487.23s -> 12491.39s]  Nancy, you forgot about breakfast. You forgot about lunch. I have customers.
[12491.39s -> 12522.54s]  That it? I think that's it. Let's go back. Thanks for being a good dog. Another explosion.
[12522.54s -> 12537.28s]  What the hell is going on out here? It wasn't the dog. The dog was with me. The dog was with
[12537.28s -> 12549.17s]  me the whole time. Do vertebrae employ this furniture to provide wings for muscle attach
[12549.17s -> 12559.18s]  missing otherwise in excellent condition. Big money. Possible urgent sleutlinosis of a new
[12559.18s -> 12572.67s]  species. This thing is important. Owner clueless. Says, says came with lodge probably excavated by
[12572.67s -> 12580.51s]  builder aka rapper Dan. Which search of immediate vicinity private property yielded possible
[12580.51s -> 12588.26s]  sauropod scapula take to lab for precise ID. Must figure out how to look for and excavate
[12588.26s -> 12601.20s]  other species in secret potential gold mine. These are just Trump tweets. Order clueless.
[12601.20s -> 12628.67s]  Okay. Well, so that's the bone. It's okay, Jerma. I get it. So, all right, let's go get that thing.
[12628.67s -> 12655.28s]  Wait, I got turned around. Which one am I going? Wait, yeah, I'm going the right way. Am I going
[12655.28s -> 12676.48s]  the right way? Yeah, okay. We're gonna check out that bone. Ah, much better. Who's this from?
[12676.48s -> 12682.90s]  Uh oh. Meet me in the sauna in the basement. I have some interesting information for you.
[12682.90s -> 12687.14s]  Well, I- Sauna sounds good to me. I'm not getting locked in the sauna. That's not gonna happen.
[12687.14s -> 12694.93s]  That's what's gonna happen. So let's prepare. Where's that? There's like a, where is it? There
[12694.93s -> 12712.00s]  it is. I need to, this is like worth a lot of money. I gotta pick this up. There's no way I don't
[12712.00s -> 12729.81s]  get- I'm gonna get closed in the sauna. Okay. Who is it? Hello? Anybody here? I'm gonna go in.
[12729.81s -> 12737.63s]  These weren't here before. That birthmark below his eye looks very familiar. Wait a minute.
[12740.42s -> 12750.66s]  Oh, somebody locked me in. Is someone out there? The door's- I'm getting really, really hot.
[12751.46s -> 12774.59s]  Well, we're dead. I can just get cold water running through these pipes. I'll be okay.
[12774.59s -> 12790.06s]  I don't get these pipes adjusted soon. I'm not gonna make it. Hold on. Not much time. I've gotta
[12790.06s -> 12797.86s]  get these pipes lined up now. What's the right? I don't get it. What's, where's it coming from?
[12798.66s -> 12810.98s]  Where's the water coming from? Is someone out there? This is really great. Finding of Isaac
[12810.98s -> 12821.73s]  music. I'm getting really, really hot. Okay. All right. So what the hell's going on here?
[12822.45s -> 12839.22s]  Do I have to connect everything? I can't take this heat much longer. Oh, that's impossible.
[12839.86s -> 12850.56s]  I don't get these pipes adjusted soon. I'm not gonna make it. What the fuck are you doing to me?
[12850.56s -> 12859.58s]  I don't have much time. I've gotta get these pipes lined up now. What the hell? This goes so fast.
[12859.58s -> 12876.32s]  Is someone out there? The door's- I'm getting really, really hot. This is a
[12876.32s -> 12898.13s]  bullshit puzzle. This is a bullshit puzzle. I'm running out of time. I've gotta do something fast.
[12898.13s -> 12904.77s]  Oh, you piece of shit. That's so awful. That's it, right? Go, go, go, go, go. That's gotta be. Why?
[12904.77s -> 12907.81s]  I've gotta get these pipes aligned before it pass out from the heat.
[12907.81s -> 12911.73s]  Every single one has to be connected, the whole thing. I can't just have one space.
[12912.69s -> 12916.13s]  I don't have much time. I've gotta get these pipes lined up now.
[12917.17s -> 12924.10s]  How the fuck am I supposed to do this? I got it. I got it. I got it. Watch, watch, watch, watch.
[12924.10s -> 12931.02s]  I have to make a closed circle with the first part and then go up. This shit is bullshit. This is
[12931.02s -> 12937.26s]  bullshit. Hey, is someone out there? The door's- I'm getting really, really hot.
[12938.22s -> 12948.38s]  No, stop.
[12959.81s -> 12962.53s]  Dude, stop doing that. This sucks.
[12969.25s -> 12969.97s]  Stop it.
[12980.19s -> 12981.62s]  That was horrible.
[12989.34s -> 12990.06s]  Trying to kill you.
[12996.77s -> 13000.69s]  Say, you look kind of bedraggled. Are you all right?
[13000.69s -> 13004.29s]  I'm fine, and I'll be even better after you and I have a little talk.
[13007.23s -> 13012.51s]  Yeah, that's me. When I was a kid, this place was practically my second home.
[13012.51s -> 13015.23s]  My late grandmother, Tilly Wentworth, used to own it.
[13016.50s -> 13024.61s]  Great. Why did you not open the door when I was dying in the sauna, screaming? I think that's
[13024.61s -> 13030.37s]  the first question we ask after we get the police here. You know what I mean? That's the
[13030.37s -> 13041.18s]  number one question. None of this other shit matters. Was she the reason you wrote that
[13041.18s -> 13046.06s]  letter I found crumpled up in your room? About two years ago, just before she died,
[13046.06s -> 13051.02s]  my grandmother sold this place to Albert Mowikwe without telling anyone in her family.
[13051.02s -> 13055.34s]  From what I've heard about Mowikwe, I'm pretty sure he bullied her into selling.
[13055.34s -> 13059.90s]  I think he cheated her, and he cheated us, and that it's high time somebody-
[13059.90s -> 13063.82s]  Taught him a lesson by, say, putting Icicle Creek Lodge out of business?
[13064.54s -> 13070.06s]  I had nothing to do with that explosion, loose window, the food poisoning, the icy stairs,
[13070.06s -> 13075.18s]  none of that stuff. You ask me, it's karma. The Mowikwes are just getting what's coming to them.
[13076.46s -> 13080.70s]  How about another game of Vox and Geese? How about another game of Vox and Geese?
[13080.70s -> 13083.50s]  Now you're talking. Have a seat. Ready? Okay.
[13085.71s -> 13089.07s]  Actually, I changed my mind. I don't want to play right now.
[13089.07s -> 13094.88s]  Okay. So what can I do for you? Since you used to spend so much time
[13094.88s -> 13097.76s]  here, do you know if there's a way to get into Trapper Dan's needle?
[13098.32s -> 13102.72s]  You know that pyramid thing on the table over there by the entrance to the dining room?
[13102.72s -> 13108.40s]  If you fool around with it until nothing but pigs show on the outside, this compartment will open
[13108.40s -> 13113.76s]  up and inside will be this round magnetic thing that used to be Trapper Dan's special master key.
[13114.40s -> 13118.08s]  Just hold it up by the needle and a hidden door will pop open.
[13118.08s -> 13123.52s]  Are you telling me that I did every animal besides pig? I did at least two of them,
[13123.52s -> 13129.09s]  and just said no. But that was the solution. I would have beat the game.
[13129.09s -> 13132.37s]  If it was all pigs, it would have opened and I would have got the key to that tower and I
[13132.37s -> 13141.06s]  would have beat the game four hours ago, five hours ago. Why did he need a special master key?
[13141.06s -> 13146.02s]  Who knows? I mean, let's face it, living all by himself way out here in the wild
[13146.02s -> 13151.46s]  winter after long dark winter, Trapper Dan was probably stark raving bonkers.
[13152.34s -> 13156.88s]  Two days ago. And we wouldn't have all these lovely memories. You know, that's true.
[13156.96s -> 13159.84s]  I better get going. Okie dokie. That's a good point.
[13161.71s -> 13168.64s]  Okay, so let's go do that. Although that would have been kind of funny.
[13170.46s -> 13184.77s]  Okay, all pigs. So what is right before pig is wolf. We have to get these all to be wolf.
[13184.77s -> 13189.68s]  Thankfully, I already did this puzzle a lot of times. I already know what to do.
[13193.10s -> 13209.25s]  Okay, now we go like this. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine.
[13210.19s -> 13216.27s]  That's fine. Okay, thankfully, open it up empty. If there was a special master key in here,
[13216.27s -> 13237.39s]  it's gone now. So what was the point of that? All for nothing? Really? Wake up. He's not in there.
[13238.11s -> 13244.19s]  Huh? Oh, now what? I opened up that pyramid like you told me, but there was nothing inside.
[13244.83s -> 13248.43s]  There wasn't? Oh, well, I'm afraid you're out of luck.
[13249.55s -> 13252.75s]  What? Could that magnetic key thing be somewhere else?
[13252.75s -> 13258.91s]  You know, Grandma Tilly once told me that if you turn the top of the pyramid 45 degrees,
[13258.91s -> 13264.43s]  then fill all the boxes on the outside with one kind of animal, then another kind of animal until
[13264.43s -> 13269.79s]  you do that for all four animals. She said if you do that, you'd find a journal in there written by
[13269.79s -> 13276.27s]  Trapper Dan himself. So just do every animal? Did you ever read it? I was a kid. What would
[13276.27s -> 13283.66s]  I want to read some crazy old coot's journal for? So go there and turn it into an animal and then
[13283.66s -> 13308.10s]  another animal and then another animal. Now, what is this? What does it want me to do? Do I have to
[13308.10s -> 13327.41s]  get it all the rows like this? One, two, okay, hold on. So one row of raccoons, a row of wolf,
[13327.41s -> 13337.78s]  row of pig, and a row of Mises. I think that's what it wants me to do. So to get this correct,
[13337.78s -> 13346.64s]  we need to line this up. So it'll always be. So what is right before wolf? This has to be
[13346.88s -> 13356.51s]  that. What is right before pig? That. And then right before this is raccoon. So if we go like
[13356.51s -> 13361.65s]  that, that's correct. But it has, okay. So that's good. So this, this, don't touch this line. This
[13361.65s -> 13379.42s]  line is, this line's fine. Okay. Pig. Oh, I messed it up. It's all right. Oh shit. You're really going
[13379.42s -> 13390.00s]  to fuck with me here now, aren't you? Okay. You're ignoring chat. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[13390.00s -> 13393.52s]  please, please stop, stop, stop. What, what, what, what, what, what am I doing the hard way?
[13393.52s -> 13486.91s]  Just do it. Okay. All right. I'm working on it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck. No. Oh boy.
[13486.91s -> 13505.25s]  Okay. I got to, I messed it up. The whole thing screwed up. Okay. I need to think about this for
[13505.25s -> 13521.58s]  a sec. It moves everything around it. I got to get all these two. Oh, this hurts my head. This
[13521.58s -> 13554.96s]  hurts my head. This hurts my head. You got to start. Okay. So you get corner and here. Oh fuck.
[13554.96s -> 13569.04s]  Oh man. I think you have to start on the corner. All right. Get everything to, what is it?
[13569.04s -> 13581.55s]  Everything has to be, everything has to be raccoon or at least close to it. This should do it.
[13581.55s -> 13594.56s]  This get all these to raccoon. Okay. And then this should do that. I should do this. Close. There it
[13594.56s -> 13605.01s]  is. Yeah. LOL. The D for beta is over. Oh, oh well. Daniel Weissnitz, better known as trapper Dan,
[13609.60s -> 13616.98s]  a hi-he-ho-ho to you for discovering my hidden journal. No doubt you already found my magnetic
[13616.98s -> 13623.46s]  key that unlocks my needle and the rooms. Keep my secrets safe, especially from the Mounties
[13623.46s -> 13631.28s]  and those rascally squirrels, evious varmints. One thing's for certain without an intelligent
[13631.28s -> 13636.16s]  creature that can crawl through small spaces such as my beloved Mary. You won't be able to
[13636.16s -> 13642.24s]  use my vaults. I fixed the vault passageways so you can see if your animal is dumb or smart by
[13642.24s -> 13647.68s]  getting lost in the vaults. Make sure your pet can jump as there are pits in there and has paws
[13647.68s -> 13654.08s]  or hooves to make the move the levers. The first thing you need to do is crack my cipher below
[13654.08s -> 13661.07s]  or just follow the moose, wolf, raccoon, and Mary. Looks like the rest is in some kind of code.
[13661.07s -> 13664.99s]  First thing you need to is to crack my cipher below or just follow the moose, wolf, raccoon,
[13664.99s -> 13700.32s]  and Mary. I think I get it. I don't. What are you saying? What is this? I have to do this?
[13700.32s -> 13709.58s]  More of this? Any combination will work. Can't find Mary? Well, try pulling on that rope above
[13709.58s -> 13715.84s]  the vaults. It'll open a surprise at the end of the hallway on the second floor. Keep it taut.
[13715.84s -> 13720.48s]  Mary always helped me with that one. She got through the maze. You just need three more
[13720.48s -> 13731.94s]  keys to open the keyholes. Oh my goodness gracious. These are the locks on the doors
[13731.94s -> 13750.46s]  that need to match the animal that need to. This thing is made out of stone. What did this shit
[13750.46s -> 13773.26s]  say again? Oh no, this. No, where's this guy's journal? Isn't this it? Where's the journal?
[13773.26s -> 13802.94s]  So the raccoons need to be the pigs. So the pigs need to be in just like the order. So raccoons
[13803.50s -> 13821.90s]  go in these two slots or something. I don't really box in the geese. Is this this blue? All right.
[13821.90s -> 13828.88s]  These are the hotel. Okay. So blue, red, white, green, blue, red. Please remember that for me.
[13828.88s -> 13851.60s]  I have to go do this to the rooms upstairs. Blue. I already forgot it. I already forgot.
[13851.60s -> 13889.62s]  Blue, red, white. Blue, red, white. Blue, red, white. Then green, blue, red. I did it. Now what?
[13889.62s -> 13893.70s]  Oh my goodness. This is one of those games where you can click out of the window accidentally and
[13893.70s -> 13903.22s]  it minimizes and re-changes all your resolutions. Wrong order. All right. Looking straight down
[13903.22s -> 13914.40s]  this way. Left side is blue. Like I'm talking like from me forward. On the left we've got blue.
[13917.71s -> 13928.90s]  Blue, red, white, green, blue, red. So blue, red, white, green, blue, red. Go to the end of the hall.
[13928.90s -> 13933.38s]  Start at the end of the hall. This isn't an emergency. I better not open it. Okay. So we've
[13933.38s -> 13956.32s]  got looking this way. Starting at the fireplace. Blue, blue, red. Okay. Blue. Stop. Oh my God. I
[13956.32s -> 13965.86s]  hate it. I hate this. I wish I could just move. This side is. So this is blue. What was it? Blue,
[13965.86s -> 13981.22s]  white, red, and green. Infinite content omega low. Hold on now. Blue, red, white on the right side.
[13981.22s -> 14000.59s]  Blue, red, white, green, blue, red. Blue, red, white. That's what I was going to say.
[14000.59s -> 14011.58s]  Green. No, close this door. What just happened? Where am I? What am I looking at? Turn back around.
[14011.58s -> 14040.91s]  Green, blue, red. That it? I don't know if that did anything. I'm taking a picture of my fucking
[14040.91s -> 14053.14s]  phone. I don't even care. I'm literally taking a picture of this on my phone. That's it. That's
[14053.14s -> 14064.91s]  what a normal, sane human being would do. We'll just take a picture of this. Here it is. Got it.
[14064.91s -> 14082.53s]  Done. Go. Got it. All right. From the fireplace, we've got on the left side, green, blue, red.
[14082.53s -> 14104.70s]  Stop turning around. On the right side, it is blue. Okay. Next, we've got blue and red. Blue on left
[14104.70s -> 14130.10s]  side. Close that fucking door. Red on this side. The final hallway is red on the left side. White
[14130.18s -> 14148.02s]  on the other side. Done. I got it. What is going on? So this should be white on the left,
[14148.02s -> 14158.90s]  red on the right. It is. The middle should be red on the left, blue on the right. It is.
[14158.90s -> 14171.14s]  Blue on the right. And the final ones should be blue on the left, green on the right. What's going
[14171.14s -> 14180.27s]  on? Yeah, I did it from the fireplace. Looking like from the fireplace. From the fireplace,
[14180.27s -> 14187.41s]  it's green, blue, red on the left, and blue, red, white on the right. I'm looking at it right now.
[14187.41s -> 14203.36s]  What about the fireplace? Check the fireplace. You have to turn the fireplace on. Do I? You need
[14203.36s -> 14214.94s]  to put fire in the fireplace. You did it right. You have to do something else. So, okay. Okay.
[14214.94s -> 14228.43s]  I keep mistaking this for the... Okay. You use my vault. Make sure you... Okay. Make sure you have a
[14228.43s -> 14249.02s]  dog. Right. Okay. Three keys. I did that. So now that's done. Throw all the books into the fireplace.
[14249.02s -> 14267.01s]  They're pretty useless anyways. So now, the raccoon? With this? Is everybody else as lost as I am?
[14267.57s -> 14316.45s]  Okay. As for the rooms, well, you'll just have to bust down the doors and remake the key.
[14316.45s -> 14323.06s]  Crack my cipher below. Can I just crack this code? I kind of want to hold this up too.
[14323.06s -> 14332.75s]  Because I have, like, the translator app. Like, take it or something. You know what I mean?
[14332.75s -> 14342.54s]  Yeah, what's this code? Cipher this code. I don't... I don't know what this is trying to tell me,
[14342.54s -> 14347.84s]  though. Like, very obviously this is that pyramid. And they're talking about this is where the raccoon
[14347.84s -> 14354.37s]  was placed. So the left side, most left side on the left was a raccoon image. It's telling me to
[14354.37s -> 14369.66s]  do whatever this is. And it wants me to spin it around. Go play the game of geese and fox.
[14369.66s -> 14380.30s]  Did I already do that, though? Do I actually have to play that with this guy? Hello again. I'd better
[14380.30s -> 14388.38s]  get going. Okey dokey. What's up? I'll catch you later. Can't do it. Hello again. I'll see you two
[14388.38s -> 14393.98s]  later, okay? See you later. Any combination will work. What's up? Oh my god. Nice talking to you.
[14393.98s -> 14397.42s]  I just wish there was a different button I could press to, like, leave instead of having to go to,
[14397.42s -> 14418.62s]  like, this magic five pixel area at the bottom of the screen. Yeah, what... what is this even
[14418.62s -> 14428.93s]  talking about? My vaults? There's, like, a whole underground world we haven't been to. It's a maze
[14428.93s -> 14454.40s]  underground, apparently. Do I have to go back to where that needle is and just go... just go there?
[14454.40s -> 14464.70s]  Those are the pyramid clues. Any combination will work, but I don't... it's a raccoon. But I don't
[14464.70s -> 14470.37s]  like spinning around with a weird fucking line in the middle. What does this even mean? If you wanted
[14470.37s -> 14473.65s]  me to spin it around, why would you draw a line in the middle? Is this a letter? What is this?
[14478.82s -> 14487.28s]  And then I thought this was a lobster until I realized it was the moose. So but where do you...
[14487.28s -> 14504.29s]  why is there... and there's, like, a slice of pizza here. Is this a pig? This is a pig. So this is a
[14504.29s -> 14520.96s]  pig's face here. What's this? What's the... hold on. Let me look at this pyramid again. There ain't
[14520.96s -> 14537.63s]  any geese! There's no goose! There's no ducks! Why am I secret hideout? Fox and geese, there is
[14537.63s -> 14543.97s]  a pig, moose, raccoon, and a wolf design on the fox and geese game table. Well, I would love these
[14543.97s -> 14564.11s]  assholes to get the fuck up from the table so I can look at the stupid thing. I can't look at it.
[14566.91s -> 14574.93s]  This needs to be lunchtime, but I can't sit here. Apologize to them. No! I'm not going to.
[14574.93s -> 14578.90s]  I'm just gonna go. I'm just going to bed. I'm just going up there. I'm gonna hit the button
[14578.90s -> 14604.14s]  fucking 10 times in a row. Wait, something on the bed. That's not... get out of my fucking way.
[14604.14s -> 14625.01s]  I have to walk up here and turn around. I want to look at the table! All right, I'm getting
[14625.01s -> 14648.66s]  tantrum-y here. Take the... someone's telling me how to do the code. Take the first line. Take...
[14648.66s -> 14657.23s]  okay, hold on. Take the first letter of the first line, then the first letter of the second line.
[14657.31s -> 14668.06s]  The second letter of the first line, then the second letter of the second line. What? The first
[14668.06s -> 14680.53s]  letter of the first line, and then that's first. So it's first things first. Dude, you have to
[14680.53s -> 14694.98s]  write this out. I have to actually write this down on a piece of paper. Hold on. First... oh,
[14694.98s -> 14699.62s]  somebody has it. First things first. Locate my secret hideout up in the mountains. It's so secret
[14699.62s -> 14704.26s]  you'll probably never find it. But if you do, find my Rex bone and use it in the wall of my
[14704.26s -> 14710.10s]  hideout. That'll open up a secret lock. You could have just said that in three words. Dan,
[14710.10s -> 14719.89s]  whatever your name is. My secret hideout up in the mountains. Find my Rex bone. That didn't help at
[14719.89s -> 14732.16s]  all. Find my Rex bone? Wasn't it telling me that this shit was made out of, like, Rex bones?
[14742.62s -> 14756.51s]  This thing right here. Yeah, so what the hell? Go back to where you met Isis.
[14760.54s -> 14790.74s]  I have to go back to fucking bed, first of all. Okay. I feel like this game has gotten very,
[14790.74s -> 14795.30s]  like, convoluted in the end. Go to my magical pyramid and press the button on the top and then
[14795.30s -> 14799.70s]  do a bunch of weird shit. And by the way, decipher my thesis code. If you can't do that, get a bone
[14799.70s -> 14811.31s]  and put... I'm trying to find... Where is this bone? You miss serving breakfast? I don't give a shit.
[14811.31s -> 14843.54s]  These people go order takeout for all I care. Why is he so mad? What happened? I'm not mad.
[14843.54s -> 14878.64s]  I'm frustrated. Okay. So now where is this thing? Under here? Maybe I can use Isis and her incredible
[14878.64s -> 14883.20s]  sense of smell to figure out who owns the notebook I found outside. I already know who's it is. All
[14883.20s -> 14887.52s]  I have to do is get something from each of the people at the lodge. Something that each of them
[14887.52s -> 14892.88s]  has touched. Then let Isis figure out which of their scents matches the scent on the notebook.
[14893.52s -> 14912.42s]  What? I don't even know what that means. Forward. Isis. Forward. Go. And smell this.
[14912.42s -> 14943.86s]  How do I get the dog to smell this? You do not have to hand it. Okay. You use a guide book.
[14943.86s -> 14960.02s]  This shit's empty. It's empty. I can't get it. We have a Vinny raid coming in right now. Vinny,
[14960.02s -> 14964.90s]  I'm having trouble. I'm having trouble. I need help from the Vinesauce community if you can help us.
[14964.90s -> 14973.41s]  Trying to figure out playing Nancy Drew right now and I'm stuck. Thanks for the raid. Welcome.
[14975.78s -> 14981.09s]  Having a little bit of trouble in the game. Somebody says there's a couple of key things
[14981.09s -> 14983.25s]  you need to find if you actually want to progress. What you need to look for is some
[14983.25s -> 14987.41s]  good old-fashioned values. It's a family guy routine that they're doing a family guy joke.
[14987.41s -> 14994.34s]  I read the rest of it. I'm not going to read the rest. Translate the rest of the words.
[15007.94s -> 15012.74s]  That looks like a Geiger counter. What? What a weird. This measures radioactivity.
[15012.74s -> 15022.22s]  I wonder if Isis found it outside somewhere or in here. Radioactivity. There's a number I could
[15022.22s -> 15041.46s]  call on this weird thing, right? Okay. I can call that. Um, leave. Right. Right. Isis. Right. Right.
[15041.46s -> 15060.88s]  Right. Right. Go. I don't really know what the game wants me to do.
[15060.88s -> 15087.02s]  Smells stuff. But how do you smell this? Bark. Bark. Isis. Bark. Go. Smell this. I don't. I need
[15087.02s -> 15093.25s]  to put the bone here, but I don't have the bone. Somebody stole the bone. I don't know who has the
[15093.25s -> 15111.09s]  bone in their possession. Did they ever expect children to do this stuff? How? Even with an
[15111.09s -> 15115.71s]  adult's help, I would, I would have been like, like son or daughter. Now close that game.
[15115.71s -> 15120.05s]  No, open up, open up fucking Nickelodeon. You know what I mean? Like, get off of this.
[15120.05s -> 15144.06s]  This is too much. Get off of this. Go watch Rugrats. You did choose senior difficulty,
[15144.06s -> 15147.90s]  to be fair. Yeah. Cause if I picked the other difficulty, everyone would have made fun of me.
[15147.90s -> 15166.78s]  Tell the dog to figure it out. I feel like this hole just, can I tell, can you leave?
[15166.78s -> 15172.24s]  Can you leave the hole? Like, this is very clearly saying, Hey, look, there's a space.
[15172.32s -> 15175.76s]  The dog can fit under here. There's no way that's not what this is. No way.
[15188.62s -> 15193.79s]  Very cute, but didn't do anything. Wait, someone's got a solution. Go back to Isis at the shack,
[15193.79s -> 15198.93s]  pass Avalanche Ridge, exit the lodge, go left. I'm at this point. I'm just going to listen to you.
[15198.93s -> 15224.99s]  I'm going to listen to you. Go left, left at the corner of the lodge, left again. So go left,
[15224.99s -> 15234.91s]  the left, left at the corner of the lodge. Wait, what's happening? Go right by the lodge and left
[15234.91s -> 15241.90s]  into the sus space. You're not helping. I already had the shack. Oh, that was the shack. Wait a
[15241.90s -> 15251.47s]  second. I need to, I'm going to uninstall this game. I swear to God, it made me drop. I just
[15251.47s -> 15263.70s]  dropped my chapstick on the ground and I'm pissed about it. Okay. I'm at the lodge. Go left. No,
[15263.70s -> 15272.08s]  I can't go left. Exit the, exit the lodge. I can't even turn around. Okay. Exit the lodge. Go left.
[15272.08s -> 15288.72s]  I'm going to follow this. I don't apply it every 30 minutes. I apply it every hour or 30 minutes.
[15288.72s -> 15305.42s]  Okay. Left, left at the corner of the lodge, left again at the next corner. No, the, no,
[15305.42s -> 15310.62s]  not the shack, the, the, okay. Not the shack, the lodge, the actual lodge where I came from.
[15310.62s -> 15316.14s]  Wait, didn't I already come back here? It's just, it's telling me to go back to where I just was.
[15316.14s -> 15328.88s]  Go back. Yeah. Why wouldn't it go back to ISIS at the shack pass ridge? Exit the lodge, go left.
[15328.88s -> 15335.20s]  Wait, what are you talking about? I just did that. I need to read this. Go left at the corner.
[15335.84s -> 15339.76s]  After the avalanche sign, you use the snowshoes. We already did this. Go forward until the shack.
[15339.76s -> 15345.20s]  Give the notebook with pictures to ISIS. Why? I was just, I didn't read the whole paragraph yet.
[15346.08s -> 15365.02s]  All right. My game is alt tabbed. Warm again. I don't want to say it.
[15365.66s -> 15385.86s]  Give her the notebook with the pictures. I didn't, I try that already. Did that already.
[15385.86s -> 15398.43s]  We did this. It just didn't do anything. It's one of those games where you have to do A, B, C, D, E,
[15398.43s -> 15403.63s]  F, G, even if you have G in your inventory. We just saw it with the stupid survey thing.
[15403.63s -> 15446.34s]  Here's the notebook. Smell that. It doesn't work. I can't even pick this up. I have to talk to
[15446.34s -> 15453.89s]  everyone in the main lodge. I don't even know what anything smells like. Like, what is this?
[15453.89s -> 15472.83s]  Hold on. This is funny. Okay. Somebody asked chat GPD. Great. In Nancy Drew, the white wolf
[15472.83s -> 15477.63s]  Icicle Creek, there's a puzzle that involves snow wolves and triangle puzzles. To solve this puzzle,
[15477.63s -> 15481.63s]  you need to first collect all the triangle pieces scattered throughout the game. Once you have all
[15481.63s -> 15485.71s]  the triangle pieces, go to the room with the wolf display and arrange the triangles to form a wolf
[15485.71s -> 15489.95s]  picture. This will reveal a hidden compartment that contains a snowshoe. Use the snowshoe to
[15489.95s -> 15500.06s]  traverse the snowy area. Well, that's not accurate. That didn't help at all. So we've got to go back
[15500.06s -> 15511.33s]  to the lodge and get things, ask people for stuff that the dog can smell. Why would I do that? Okay.
[15511.33s -> 15533.14s]  This is actually a Wind Waker quest. This is actually driving me crazy. It's going to get dark
[15533.14s -> 15552.99s]  soon and cold. I'm going in. Going in where? I feel warmer already. Let's get Luigi'd. Go to
[15552.99s -> 15560.40s]  the basement. Go to the workbench and get a red rug. Everybody's just telling me the solutions.
[15560.40s -> 15576.66s]  I mean, they're kind of, I mean, come on. Go to the workbench. I'll let you get back to work.
[15576.66s -> 15587.55s]  See you later. How can I help you? I hear that a major cross-country skiing competition may be held
[15587.55s -> 15598.72s]  in this area in a couple of years. This is very true. The towels in the rooms, the laundry.
[15598.72s -> 15604.24s]  I also hear that you can be pretty imaginative when it comes to gaining an edge on your competition.
[15604.24s -> 15610.00s]  I told you about the bomb. My competitors will stop at nothing to defeat me. I am forced to seek out
[15610.00s -> 15615.86s]  and exploit every possible advantage open to me. I take no pride in some of the things I've done
[15615.86s -> 15622.22s]  to bring victory to my country, but I have no choice. I would love to stop clicking out of the
[15622.22s -> 15634.18s]  window. I have disturbed you long enough. We'll talk again, I'm sure. Okay. I need to,
[15634.18s -> 15639.30s]  there's just a certain order to, this is a granny like. I'm conceding that. This is a granny like.
[15639.30s -> 15645.57s]  I didn't think it was, but it is. Everything has to be done in a specific fucking particular order
[15645.57s -> 15652.59s]  or it won't work. It's a granny like. And I'm being chased by my own embarrassment from the chat room.
[15652.59s -> 15656.67s]  That's what's chasing me around these rooms. Laughing at me, pointing at me. You're the granny
[15656.67s -> 15664.10s]  in this situation. It is a granny like. I would love to put the bullet down.
[15664.10s -> 15670.26s]  That's all the questions I had. Good. I would love to put this down, but I have a full,
[15671.06s -> 15683.68s]  full fucking inventory. Oh no, I don't. Relax. Relax. Everything's fine. There's no problem.
[15683.68s -> 15695.10s]  I just keep clicking out of this stupid thing. Please give me the one correct route to go up
[15695.10s -> 15704.90s]  the stairs. Oh my God. Okay. Okay. Cool. I made it out of the basement. Now what?
[15705.62s -> 15717.58s]  He's having a meltdown. It's getting there. Do I have the laundry bag in my gigantic inventory
[15717.58s -> 15721.28s]  of old notes that I didn't even know why I'm keeping any of these? What's the point of me
[15721.28s -> 15724.64s]  holding onto the shit in my inventory? Why do I have this? Throw it in the trash. Throw this away.
[15724.64s -> 15728.40s]  I don't need it. Throw it away. I don't need it. Get rid of it. Throw it in the trash. Where's the
[15728.40s -> 15751.31s]  trash can? Fucking laundry bag. He's losing it. I am. I should have picked, all right. If I haven't
[15751.31s -> 15758.83s]  played a Nancy Drew game ever again, I am picking the, the children, whatever the, the, as whatever
[15758.83s -> 15765.71s]  the, I'm picking like the junior detective mode. I ain't picking the senior detective mode that
[15765.71s -> 15770.11s]  back in like the mid 2000s that was telling you, Hey dude, this is going to be, this is going to
[15770.11s -> 15775.74s]  suck. Don't do that. This is like not even, this is higher than parents difficulty. This is bring
[15775.74s -> 15779.10s]  this to school and give it to your teacher difficulty. This is your teacher's going to look
[15779.10s -> 15786.85s]  at it and go, I don't fucking know what this is. Go sit down. Okay. So we're going to go to bed.
[15786.85s -> 15810.56s]  We're going to wake up at 1 AM. Apparently I got it out. I feel fine. I can't go in. If I unlock
[15810.56s -> 15821.97s]  the door and someone's inside. Yikes. It's why am I waking up at one o'clock in the morning?
[15823.17s -> 15828.53s]  Why is that happening? Can somebody help me here? Why am I waking up at one o'clock in the morning
[15828.53s -> 15857.42s]  every day? They don't need their rooms cleaned anymore. Okay. Take all the laundry. I think I'll
[15857.42s -> 15873.57s]  keep one of these washcloths. Okay. Good. Good. Excellent. Very nice. There we go. Okay. Now let's
[15873.57s -> 15893.65s]  keep going. Excellent. Very cool. Very good. Okay. I've got these. There's one more, right?
[15893.65s -> 15905.12s]  No, that's it. That's it. I've got the three that I need. You're not making the beds. I don't care.
[15905.12s -> 15917.23s]  They're going to fire me anyways. I don't care. This one's already done. All right. So I've got
[15917.23s -> 15925.14s]  these. Now I have to bring this to the dog. I believe these are the only three. Please get out
[15925.14s -> 15944.90s]  of the room. Nancy Drew killed Diablo. Now I missed one. What am I missing? There wasn't one in the
[15944.90s -> 15959.33s]  other room. No, I don't want to give. This is my room, right? It wasn't any in one of these rooms
[15959.33s -> 15980.30s]  though. I need the other. Oh, I need to go to the workbench, right? That's where you get the other
[15980.30s -> 15997.73s]  that dude's rag. You're losing viewers. That's fine. Sorry. It's okay. All right. So now this
[15998.37s -> 16002.77s]  I need to drop this laundry bag down the chute upstairs. No, I don't want to do that.
[16002.77s -> 16007.98s]  How do I put this? Put it away. I don't want to carry dirty laundry around all day.
[16007.98s -> 16024.37s]  I should get rid of this bag. I'm going to kick this door. What? What's going on? I should get
[16024.37s -> 16046.10s]  rid of this laundry bag before I forget. Hi. How do I get his? I need his. What you need.
[16046.10s -> 16052.61s]  I'll let you get back to work. By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were
[16052.61s -> 16061.34s]  cleaned. So I put it back up at the front desk. How do I get his? Go upstairs, enter and go to
[16061.34s -> 16069.23s]  the moose head, right? Click on the moose's eye, take the moose disk with the radio. This is worse
[16069.23s -> 16078.83s]  than a granny like go upstairs to Yanni's room, enter and go to the moose head, right of the door,
[16078.83s -> 16082.91s]  click on the moose's eye, take the moose disk, look at the radio, click on the radio. And there's a
[16082.91s -> 16101.70s]  foreign somebody's talking and then talk to Yanni in the basement about the radio. Jesus. What the
[16101.70s -> 16118.27s]  hell is this thing? It's a third room on a moose head. Oh, give me a fucking break. If something
[16118.27s -> 16126.72s]  tells me this radio belongs to Yanni and if so, why is he hiding it? Click on a moose's head to
[16126.72s -> 16161.33s]  get it a key item. Now go, Hey, what's the radio in your room? Okay. Now let's go talk to you about
[16161.33s -> 16168.80s]  the radio I found in the room. How can I help? Hi. Why do you have a radio hidden away in your room?
[16168.80s -> 16174.78s]  You've got the disk. How do you know about that? When I got done cleaning the moose head, that
[16174.78s -> 16181.34s]  compartment was open. When I looked in it, there was the radio. Now you answer my question. I use
[16181.34s -> 16187.10s]  that radio to communicate with my coaches. It's a special radio. It scrambles the signal so that my
[16187.10s -> 16192.22s]  competitors cannot listen in. How did you know there was a secret compartment in your room?
[16192.22s -> 16197.10s]  The first night I was here, I searched for bugs. Something which, due to the cunning of my
[16197.10s -> 16203.34s]  competitors, I've become very good at. I discovered that by pushing on the moose eye, a compartment
[16203.34s -> 16209.10s]  opened up. What I don't know is, did you really open that compartment by mistake or were you up
[16209.10s -> 16216.96s]  to something else? I'm a detective. I'm a detective. I'm a detective. I'm a detective. Shut up.
[16216.96s -> 16222.96s]  I'm no spy, Mr. Volksteyer. I'm just very observant. Who else have you told about the radio?
[16223.52s -> 16230.24s]  No one. I believe you, Nancy. So if I find out you're lying, both of us will be very sorry.
[16230.24s -> 16237.62s]  Okay. You're busy, so I'll let you go. Hold on, I'll be right back. I gotta get the crime disk
[16237.62s -> 16244.72s]  from out of whatever that was. I'll be back. Hold on, just be right back. I'm going to get the crime
[16244.72s -> 16277.41s]  disk out of your room. All right, now where is it? Did I get it? Okay, got it. All right, now show
[16277.41s -> 16297.73s]  him the crime disk. Okay. Make him take off the wetsuit. How can I help you? Do you have any proof
[16297.73s -> 16303.41s]  that your competitors are out there spying on you? When one has enemies, it's prudent to assume that
[16303.41s -> 16310.38s]  they are always close by. They are here, Nancy. Make no mistake. Okay, can you imagine? We have
[16310.38s -> 16318.05s]  a conversation here. I found this hidden radio up in your room. You did? Oh, well, that was nothing.
[16318.05s -> 16322.77s]  Why were you in my room looking through my things? Well, because I was, I'm a detective.
[16322.77s -> 16327.01s]  I'm trying to find like a killer and who's trying to kill people and shit. Oh, don't do that again.
[16327.01s -> 16335.63s]  Okay. Yeah, I won't. And then I turn around and I fucking sprint fucking stairs and they,
[16335.63s -> 16343.84s]  and he hears above him me running up the other fucking stairs. Are you chasing, am I getting
[16343.84s -> 16358.30s]  chased? You're busy, so I'll let you go. That's how fast I was going. Okay, so now I can take that
[16358.30s -> 16365.22s]  thing. What you need? I'll let you get back to work. If you need anything, just holler.
[16366.08s -> 16381.46s]  Everything's good. We're fine. Okay, so now where do I take that thing? This goes into,
[16382.26s -> 16429.26s]  it goes into a slot. Is it fire? Fireplace? Really? You need to look for the shotgun behind the front
[16429.26s -> 16437.41s]  desk. There'll be a buckshot under the rug. Shut. Come on, man. The fire necklace will tell you all
[16437.41s -> 16442.69s]  you need to open up. Sly raccoons hiding place. Just don't wake up in the, yeah, this is very
[16442.69s -> 16449.86s]  helpful. Don't wake, go back and take a look at the fire necklace at the display table. Take note
[16449.86s -> 16454.58s]  of the colors of the disks. Go back up to the guest rooms. Look close to the colored wedges above
[16454.58s -> 16476.05s]  the doorknobs. Yeah, you're a click. Look at the picture of the raccoon between. Yeah, I would never
[16476.05s -> 16481.17s]  would have clicked on this. I just wouldn't have. I never would have clicked the random painting on
[16481.17s -> 16492.86s]  the wall. I never would have done that. Okay, so where, how do I get the pig one? This is the pig.
[16492.86s -> 16508.67s]  How do I light the fireplace? Go talk to Lou. You know what's so funny about this? There are about
[16508.67s -> 16517.81s]  17,000 people here right now. I bet you at least 12 to 13,000 of you have the guide open on like,
[16517.81s -> 16523.36s]  you have like the game facts open and you're all just sitting there going, how are we going to just,
[16523.44s -> 16528.38s]  how do I make sure he reads this? I think two or three thousand of you just gave up and like are
[16528.38s -> 16532.86s]  making food right now and you can probably hear me from across the room. Maybe you put me on the TV
[16532.86s -> 16535.74s]  and you're like, you know what? I'm, he's not going to finish this in like the next 20 minutes. I'm
[16535.74s -> 16539.66s]  going to make like a steak and I'm probably talking to you right now. You may, hopefully the steak is
[16539.66s -> 16544.00s]  good. Hope you cook it well. Well, not well done, but well enough for you to enjoy it. And then I
[16544.00s -> 16548.75s]  think like a couple thousand of you just left and they were like, I'm going to bed. So for all of
[16548.75s -> 16566.48s]  the 12,000 of you that had the game facts open, I appreciate it. Now we need to talk to Lou. One
[16566.48s -> 16570.96s]  person has it open 12,000 or just copy and pasting the one person's answers and changing
[16570.96s -> 16578.86s]  one word to be sus. That's also true. You're right. A lot of you are not helping at all.
[16578.86s -> 16582.94s]  You're copy and pasting the real answer and then adding like, and then you poo poo all over and
[16582.94s -> 16587.42s]  then you pee pee. And then it's like, okay, well I've read that one. I didn't, but you know,
[16587.42s -> 16593.14s]  I did read it, but I didn't say that I read it until right now. Lou. Yeah. Well, good luck with
[16593.14s -> 16608.74s]  the game. In real moose, the moose, the moose, the moose, the moose. I can't already have the
[16608.74s -> 16618.18s]  moose eye. Why are you telling me to click on the moose? I already have it. How do I talk to Lou?
[16618.74s -> 16633.07s]  Hello again. I'll see you two later. Okay. I haven't served food in three days. What's up?
[16633.07s -> 16641.42s]  Nice talking to you. Ditto dude. I'm going to sneeze and I'm really sorry. Wait, I need to do
[16641.42s -> 16676.42s]  this. Come on. I wanted so badly to get that. If it's back, I'll do it. Damn it. I want to click
[16676.42s -> 16685.09s]  on this one. I can't even click on it. As long as it's not time to cook, I might as well stay out
[16685.09s -> 16720.83s]  of the kitchen. I can't click this one. Um, someone's talking about like element ring strategies.
[16720.83s -> 16733.94s]  Mm hmm. Things are not going well for stripper. German 95 has been having a little trouble in
[16733.94s -> 16746.90s]  Nancy Drew playthrough. I do not have the bone yet. I can't open it. I'm going to call this number
[16746.90s -> 16778.62s]  three, three, four, five, five, five, seven, six, two, five. What is this? My name is Nancy Drew.
[16778.62s -> 16785.31s]  I'm staying at the Icicle Creek Lodge and I recently came across some kind of device that
[16785.31s -> 16795.84s]  had your phone number on it. Well, it has a spike on one end of it. And well, actually this,
[16795.84s -> 16802.00s]  I mean, someone's dog was using it as a chew toy. She must have found it outside somewhere.
[16802.00s -> 16829.81s]  You know what it is? What's a geophone? They said it sounds like a frog detective voice.
[16829.81s -> 16863.28s]  OK, so I got to go take the radiation device. When you say seismic waves, are you talking about
[16863.28s -> 16889.23s]  earthquakes? So to put the geophones to use, you need to blow things up. So if someone were
[16889.23s -> 16905.10s]  looking for valuable mineral deposits, they might use geophones to do it. Types of mineral deposits
[16905.10s -> 16929.01s]  are likely to be found around the Icicle Creek drainage. Good word. What do you know about
[16929.01s -> 16932.93s]  dinosaur bones? What do you know about dinosaur bones? That's not the one I wanted to click on.
[16932.93s -> 16964.08s]  Are dinosaur bones good for anything? Delete that part of the stream. Just rewind that and delete
[16964.08s -> 16978.11s]  it. I came across a Geiger counter. What can you tell me about them? How am I able to bring that
[16978.11s -> 17034.54s]  up? Do you know what range of radiation is unsafe? All right. In other words, if I'm doing a high
[17034.54s -> 17038.70s]  reading on my Geiger counter, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm an imminent danger.
[17046.94s -> 17084.93s]  All right. 990. 990 frequency. All right. So that's cool and all. So can I turn the radio station?
[17084.93s -> 17111.04s]  Or this is 990. It's the radio. You sound sad. Yeah. I just wanted to. You don't. I can't. OK,
[17111.04s -> 17120.35s]  turn it to nine. I don't know what this is. There's too many moving parts in this game.
[17120.35s -> 17134.22s]  I have. Should I bring this stuff to get sniffed? Look at all this shit in my inventory.
[17134.30s -> 17176.86s]  How do I get this open? I can't get it open. I need to talk to Lou. Every time I talk to Lou,
[17176.86s -> 17184.42s]  he's sitting at that game and he just goes, talk to you later. A to B, B to C, C to D, D to E,
[17184.42s -> 17191.62s]  E to G, G to X, and then Y and Z. And you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And if you go from 1 to 4,
[17191.62s -> 17222.03s]  what's going on? Somebody's like radiated here. Turn around. What's up? Nice talking to you.
[17222.03s -> 17236.43s]  Ditto, dude. I can't talk to Lou. Lou doesn't do anything. The bear? What about the ram head?
[17236.43s -> 17296.22s]  How do I get it? I need a ladder. I need a ladder. The door colors are wrong. Go check them.
[17296.78s -> 17302.08s]  No, they're not. I wouldn't. I wouldn't really get the raccoon one if that was the case.
[17302.08s -> 17320.96s]  Why is there a radiation mechanic in a Nancy Drew game? Oh, this game is fucked. I need to
[17320.96s -> 17330.30s]  turn the fire on. So I need to somehow get whatever. This is the pig head. I got to get
[17330.30s -> 17336.51s]  the fire to turn on, but I also have to get the ram one too. So I need a stepladder or something.
[17336.51s -> 17347.52s]  Have I not beaten this game yet? I don't know, because the game is fucking goofy. So this is a
[17347.52s -> 17368.24s]  goofy game. This is a wacky game. I could maybe go back and have the dog smell this. That's the
[17368.24s -> 17376.42s]  only thing I can think of right now. Understand anything else. What the hell am I supposed to do?
[17376.42s -> 17400.58s]  Just do that. Why do you pick the hilarious difficulty? I didn't mean to. It was only it
[17400.58s -> 17414.48s]  was this or easy. See what the dog says about this stuff, which I view left of the stream in
[17414.48s -> 17419.73s]  the last 20 minutes. He came back to check on us. The dog talks. That's a kind of bizarre,
[17419.73s -> 17423.01s]  by the way. So you missed that, which is very weird when it started talking.
[17423.65s -> 17440.03s]  I mean, I don't I don't think it should be like an Elmo voice. It was off putting and weird when
[17440.03s -> 17447.55s]  it was like Elmo was like high pitched kind of Elmo voice. I'm surprised I actually decided to
[17447.55s -> 17452.11s]  give it that kind of a voice. All right. What do you think about this? I shouldn't give Isis that.
[17452.11s -> 17474.16s]  I should give her the notebook. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Looks like it's not Yanni's
[17474.16s -> 17484.56s]  negative for Bill Kessler. The sense match, which we got those notes belong to Lou Talbot.
[17486.77s -> 17504.80s]  Good dog. Hey, Lou got a bone to pick with you, Lou.
[17507.52s -> 17535.50s]  Everybody laugh. We just sneaking with our jokes like that. I was going to walk in with the notebook
[17535.50s -> 17540.26s]  in my hand, holding it straight up. He's like a cigarette too. You know what I mean?
[17541.86s -> 17549.04s]  Just walk right in the front door. What's it say in the first passage here? Oh,
[17549.04s -> 17554.96s]  two vertebrae employed as furniture, but your fried wings for muscle attachment.
[17557.70s -> 17560.74s]  It's quite the notebook. Just be talking loudly about it.
[17562.72s -> 17571.81s]  Now where would I be able to find the owner of this notebook? I wonder warm again. Now what?
[17571.81s -> 17583.81s]  What is this? Lou Talbot charged with trespassing, vandalism and theft. I have a plan property,
[17583.81s -> 17591.30s]  creating a piece of earth a texture inspired by maverick artist Poppy Dada of keeping the
[17591.30s -> 17611.84s]  dinosaur bones dug up on the process. Dinosaur bones. Hey Lou, can I get your hand with
[17611.84s -> 17624.85s]  something in the kitchen? Oh, he's gone. Not time for kitchen duty yet. I feel like it hasn't been
[17625.57s -> 17645.73s]  for days. Let me in here. That just hurt my fucking head. I did too many and it hurt.
[17647.39s -> 17672.99s]  Why is that so loud? Okay, so now I call somebody. I mean, I know that I need to talk to Lou,
[17672.99s -> 17702.74s]  but Lou is not here. Do I just have to go to sleep? Can I get that ladder? Thanks for taking the time
[17702.74s -> 17714.53s]  to talk to me. Come back anytime. What you need. I'll let you get back to work. Keep me posted.
[17722.00s -> 17727.04s]  When you make the scavenger hunt too hard, the kids can't do it and you just have to keep telling
[17727.04s -> 17734.61s]  them where things are hidden. I should put on a coat before I go outside. I don't know where the
[17734.61s -> 17742.96s]  egg is. Well, did you go up and press the face of the ox up in the bedroom? No. Well, after that,
[17742.96s -> 17749.04s]  did you take the Geiger counter out of the wall and then find the radiated banana that I put
[17749.04s -> 17757.25s]  under the sink? No. Well, I mean, and then after doing that, did you look down the third drain of
[17757.25s -> 17763.38s]  the fourth toilet in the house? I just want to collect eggs. I don't want to do this. Well,
[17763.38s -> 17770.56s]  you must be a dumb kid then. Let me show you where everything is. And I don't even fucking know.
[17770.56s -> 17774.40s]  All right. It's the banana. I like open up the banana, peel the banana and then there's a code
[17774.40s -> 17779.54s]  written on the peel. No, it's not. The code's not on this banana peel. No, I must have written that
[17780.34s -> 17786.19s]  underneath the desk. I don't, it's not there either. I don't know where your eggs are. They're gone,
[17786.19s -> 17792.11s]  kid. They're fucking out of here. They're gone. I ate all the eggs. I ate all the chocolate in them.
[17793.07s -> 17808.46s]  That's what happened to them. Okay. I need to talk to Lou. I feel warmer already. I'm just going
[17808.46s -> 17830.93s]  to fucking bed. Mr. Green, are you all right? No, I can't get out of here. I'm fine. Stupid Easter
[17830.93s -> 17841.23s]  eggs hunt anyways. When I was younger, we did money hunts. My father put six grand in a brief
[17841.23s -> 17845.31s]  case we hid it and me and all my siblings had to beat the shit out of each other and find it.
[17845.95s -> 17851.94s]  He hid it in one place. He gave us all different clues that were wrong. We had to come together
[17851.94s -> 17855.94s]  and put our pieces of our clues together, but it never worked out that way. We just beat the shit
[17855.94s -> 17866.51s]  out of each other. I don't talk to any of my siblings anymore either. There he is. What's up?
[17866.51s -> 17875.28s]  Can I have the Rex bone that you took from the plaque? Do you think I could have the Rex
[17875.28s -> 17881.12s]  bone that you took from that plaque by the display case? Dude, what makes you think I took some bone
[17881.12s -> 17890.02s]  from some plaque? Don't get smart with me. Because you referred to it in your notebook.
[17890.98s -> 17896.74s]  He's losing it. I'm fine. Someone who has a really good nose for such things is positive that it's
[17896.74s -> 17902.02s]  yours. All right, here's the deal. There's a lot of people out there who collect stuff like fossils
[17902.02s -> 17907.70s]  and dinosaur bones, okay? They pay big bucks for them. And it just so happens paleontology is kind
[17907.70s -> 17915.50s]  of my thing. This guy's drip is atrocious. I disagree because this reminds me of Scott Cyclops's
[17915.50s -> 17921.81s]  drip, which is the blue with the yellow thing that goes across. That's Scott Cyclops's drip.
[17921.81s -> 17925.36s]  I like this. Don't call this bad drip. It's the same outfit.
[17949.38s -> 17952.02s]  You want the bone from that plaque? Go ahead and take it.
[17952.74s -> 17958.58s]  Okay, dude. Excitement's over. Who's move? Okay, dude.
[17961.70s -> 17991.57s]  That's awesome. Okay, dude. All these bones. Lou's been a busy guy. Okay, dude. Here's the one I'm
[17991.57s -> 17995.89s]  looking for. Give me that. The Rex bone that's missing from that plaque. It is. Now let's go do
[17995.89s -> 18028.58s]  it and solve the mystery. Did I call anybody? Crumpled paper under the desk? I think we already
[18028.58s -> 18036.86s]  called that number. I lost my phone. Can you call it for me? Yeah, yeah. Give me a second.
[18036.86s -> 18062.35s]  It's ringing. It's in the room somewhere. I can hear it somewhere in the house. Can you hear it?
[18064.13s -> 18070.26s]  Check under the sofa. Like just look under the bed. Yeah, somewhere in here. I don't know where
[18070.26s -> 18104.05s]  your fucking phone is. You're sitting on it. I'm not sitting on it. I already looked. I still don't
[18104.05s -> 18121.58s]  have the other coins though. If you don't need it. I'm not sitting on it. Do you want me to call it
[18121.58s -> 18127.89s]  again to see if I'll prove I'm not sitting on it? I'm calling you right now. I'm calling it again.
[18127.89s -> 18176.22s]  My service. Hold on a second. My phone's fucked up. All right. It's ringing. I don't know where
[18176.22s -> 18187.78s]  it is. It's not underneath me. Oh shit. It's underneath me. I just set up. What do I do?
[18187.78s -> 18201.79s]  What do you want to do with this? I was sitting on it. Fuck. All right. I gotta. That's weird.
[18201.79s -> 18214.40s]  I was kind of muffled before I picked it up from under my ass. But I don't know. I don't know what
[18214.40s -> 18221.07s]  that was. But, um, that's pretty. I guess we just did that. This one. Oh, that just happened.
[18222.74s -> 18241.50s]  Fucking door. There it is. So I can rearrange these by continuing to drop the tile that falls
[18241.50s -> 18246.70s]  out the bottom into one of the columns at the top. What? The question is, how should I rearrange
[18246.70s -> 18254.05s]  them, match the symbols and line them up in rows of three? Maybe. Oh no. It's the shit again.
[18254.05s -> 18270.64s]  It wants me to do all this weird shit. Can I change the difficulty right now? I gotta put
[18270.64s -> 18371.68s]  all the coins in. Don't I? No. Wait. What is it? Okay. Wait. No. No. Having a tantrum. Um,
[18371.68s -> 18380.98s]  so there's an extra one here. The question is, how do I, I gotta get rid of the extra one.
[18380.98s -> 18409.14s]  Putting it in. Like it's just stupid ass puzzle. I just don't know the order. It's just, I just
[18409.14s -> 18414.72s]  don't know what order I need to do this in. I'm just so over this. I'm just over it. I would
[18414.72s -> 18436.59s]  smash this thing with a fucking hammer until I got it. Well, how many are in this row? The order is
[18436.59s -> 18444.13s]  beside it. I know it's fish owl bunny, but this one stupid ass duck is ruining everything for me.
[18444.13s -> 18451.82s]  Only the answers were in a book. Yeah. I can't, I have to like leave this to open up the book.
[18451.82s -> 18458.74s]  It wants me to do this first and that's all fine and dandy, but how do I get rid of this stupid
[18458.74s -> 18473.76s]  duck? I need to get the fish to be like the next thing coming down like here. How do I get it out
[18473.76s -> 18488.48s]  of order? Like on the bottom row is if I'm going to, I have to start moving shit around. I'm going
[18488.48s -> 18494.70s]  to get all this. It's going to get all messed up because it takes so many coins out. Whatever.
[18494.70s -> 18501.74s]  I'm just going to fuck the whole thing up. I just don't, I don't know how to get to the solution I
[18501.74s -> 18526.11s]  want to get to. Is that it? No, it's not. God damn it. Range two columns at a time. Uh, I'm just,
[18526.67s -> 18530.85s]  I've been playing this dumb ass fucking children's game for five hours. Where am I going with this
[18530.85s -> 18543.15s]  one left? I didn't, I didn't even know you could fucking do that. Are you kidding me? But that
[18543.15s -> 18557.60s]  doesn't help. Crazy how not hard this is. Well, it's not hard when you know exactly how to do it.
[18557.60s -> 18562.80s]  I don't know how to do it. So it's not easy for me. It's hard for me because I don't know what I
[18562.80s -> 18584.69s]  have to do. I mean, I get it, but I'm running into a wall in my brain. That's why puzzles exist.
[18584.69s -> 18595.41s]  All these symbols and shapes and placement. Like I could sprint a hundred miles per hour in five
[18595.41s -> 18601.79s]  seconds. You give me a ball. I could hit that fucking ball hard. I can do anything else with
[18601.79s -> 18631.89s]  this. I need to reset it. The game won't even let me leave. It's like, no, dude, you're here.
[18631.89s -> 18641.57s]  You're, you're stuck here. Yeah. I know what it's supposed to look like. It's supposed to be fish,
[18641.57s -> 18650.45s]  owl, bunny. I'm about to just let you guys do it while I watch fucking SpongeBob on another
[18650.45s -> 18676.82s]  yellow monitor. Let me see if I can get it. Let me try it one more time. So bunny, bunny,
[18676.82s -> 18682.18s]  fish fit. It's just like, it's like knocking shit down. I can rearrange these by continuing to drop
[18682.18s -> 18686.26s]  the tile that falls out the bottom. I hate looking at this. Columns at the top. Then everybody get
[18686.26s -> 18691.70s]  that way. We look at just a shitload of symbols and you just can't anymore. They all just meld
[18691.70s -> 18702.53s]  together into one picture. Like this is all melding into one image. They're all, it's all the same
[18702.53s -> 18707.41s]  picture. It's all literally the same photo. I can't move them around. They're stuck here.
[18707.41s -> 18733.65s]  Maybe Dave can help. I almost feel like I want two coins at the same time, but I can't, I can't get
[18733.65s -> 18751.09s]  that. He's going to end the stream. I'm not going to end the stream. It's like a slight. Yeah. It's
[18751.09s -> 18757.34s]  all the slider puzzle dog shit. All right. Slider puzzles are problems too. I wasn't going to get
[18757.34s -> 18766.98s]  angry today. Slider puzzle. Oh God. No, I can't do a slider puzzle. Oh no. You know, when we were
[18767.06s -> 18775.09s]  younger, we didn't do slider puzzles. We went down the slip and slide off on rocks. Yeah. None of
[18775.09s -> 18791.66s]  this smooth fucking grass bullshit. Let me look at this again. Reset the whole thing. So I can
[18791.66s -> 18796.86s]  rearrange these by continuing to drop the tile that falls out the bottom into one of the columns
[18796.86s -> 18802.53s]  at the top. I know how it works Nancy. How should I rearrange them? Match the symbols and line them
[18802.53s -> 18817.58s]  up in rows of three maybe? Nancy. Hold on. I'm going to click that out of the window. You want
[18817.58s -> 18825.17s]  the bunny on top. Yeah. I, you need the bunny on top. Always keep the animal tokens next to each
[18825.17s -> 18836.14s]  other. That's the theory. Oh, I've got wicked bad diarrhea right now. I'm just, oh, I'm sorry.
[18836.14s -> 18853.06s]  Stomach is like fucking like a wicked bad diarrhea right now. I think it passed. I think I'm all
[18853.06s -> 18862.37s]  right. Yeah. I think I'm good. Get a good look at this. All right. The duck definitely has to go.
[18862.37s -> 18871.39s]  If it were me doing this, I would probably put the duck second row or the first row. I think
[18871.39s -> 18874.99s]  now that can go to the right side because you want to make sure that that's in the middle now
[18874.99s -> 18878.98s]  and then that goes on the left side for me. I would put this in the middle and this is going
[18878.98s -> 18884.21s]  to go up here and then on the left again, I think, and then probably back up. But I would
[18884.21s -> 18890.21s]  say probably on the left side and the left again and then maybe on the right. No, I would say
[18890.21s -> 18901.98s]  probably the middle. I think that's correct. Maybe the right left side and the right side
[18901.98s -> 18909.22s]  and the left side again. The walkthrough is different now. How, how, how, how would you
[18909.22s -> 18914.86s]  fucking do this shit? Look at all this and look at this mess. This is a fucking mess. I'm cheating.
[18914.86s -> 18921.20s]  I don't care. I'm literally cheating right now. I hate these. All these games that have just slider
[18921.28s -> 18925.57s]  puzzle after slider puzzle. I would, I would know just give me anything else besides this.
[18925.57s -> 18936.88s]  I can't even follow the guide. It's happening so fast. I'd rather eat my own hand than do a
[18936.88s -> 18955.33s]  slider puzzle. Okay. This goes here. So I can rearrange these by continuing to drop the
[18955.33s -> 18960.13s]  this is like the worst. This is my least favorite way to play a video game is these kinds of
[18960.13s -> 18968.35s]  puzzles. How should I rearrange the game? Just crashed. Stop fucking with me. Match the symbols
[18968.35s -> 18988.19s]  and line them. And I lost my place in the video slider puzzles. Okay. Goose goes first and that
[18988.19s -> 18998.48s]  goes on the right side that mine is different than the walkthrough. What, what's going on?
[18998.48s -> 19020.98s]  Is it our, is it random? The walkthrough is going too fast. This is not, I put, why did I put this
[19020.98s -> 19027.78s]  on a hard? What was I doing? It's Nancy Drew. Do I really care? The tile that falls out the bottom
[19027.78s -> 19034.82s]  into one of the columns at the top. Question is how should I match the symbols and line them up
[19034.82s -> 19041.78s]  in rows of three? Maybe if I was in bed with my iPad, I wouldn't care. I would be doing this,
[19041.78s -> 19056.86s]  but I'm, we're not in bed. I'm not, we're not in bed. We're not there. That no baited me.
[19057.42s -> 19061.89s]  It actually baited me. This is not supposed to go here. They put the, they hovered over here.
[19061.89s -> 19089.57s]  And it was like, Oh, no. And then they moved. What the fuck? Christ, man. So I can rearrange
[19089.57s -> 19094.21s]  these. I know how it works. Stop talking. That falls out the bottom into one of the columns at
[19094.21s -> 19100.35s]  the top. The question is how should I rearrange them? Match the symbols and line them up in rows
[19100.35s -> 19108.75s]  of three, maybe. I'm going to laugh if this walkthrough takes a wicked long time to do this.
[19116.42s -> 19142.22s]  That was the one that, okay, that was, don't, I got to, okay, right here, installing. I don't think
[19142.22s -> 19231.25s]  they know where to go. Yeah, they do. How long does this take to do this? I hope I'm doing this
[19231.25s -> 19287.36s]  right. Cause this is long, man. This is a long time. I'm going to imagine if I did this and it was
[19287.36s -> 19292.40s]  just like a fuck you germa at the end and this doesn't, was supposed to doing anything. I feel
[19292.40s -> 19312.85s]  like that could happen. Come on, man. Come on. It has to be getting close. It has to be right.
[19312.85s -> 19350.72s]  I'm going to miss a step. Just pay attention. Why does my back hurt? This is not ending. How
[19350.72s -> 19366.10s]  much longer? When do I get to leave this? Okay. I think it's close. I'm just following what it's
[19366.10s -> 19394.98s]  doing. I'm just following the walkthrough. I'm following the walkthrough. I promise. I got it.
[19394.98s -> 19434.88s]  Bingo. All right. Bingo. Scary. A little creepy. Looks like the map to some kind of maze. Christ.
[19453.76s -> 19461.60s]  Where am I right now? I'm taking a picture of this. No, nobody, no human does this without a
[19461.60s -> 19477.04s]  fucking photo. Um, where am I right now? Here or here? Do I know where I am? Follow me. I wonder
[19477.04s -> 19496.56s]  if she expects me to do something. Um, I want you to go. I want you to go. I don't know what,
[19496.56s -> 19504.91s]  I don't know even what direction I'm even facing. What direction are we looking? Around ISIS, around.
[19504.91s -> 19521.71s]  This map is meaningless unless I know what direction I'm looking. What? All right. Even
[19521.71s -> 19528.42s]  the dog doesn't want to do this. The dog doesn't want to do this either. All right. So let's just
[19528.42s -> 19534.90s]  let forward around. Around. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Let's just see what happens.
[19534.90s -> 19546.62s]  ISIS. Around. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Go. I just want to know what I'm even
[19546.62s -> 19561.70s]  looking at. Forward. Forward. Forward. Looks like some kind of gate is in her way. Um, forward.
[19561.78s -> 19576.37s]  Forward. Hold on. Forward. Forward four times and then right? Right? Forward. Right. I don't,
[19576.37s -> 19583.50s]  how many commands can I even queue up? ISIS. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Right. Right.
[19583.50s -> 19601.14s]  Go. Your dog is a rudimentary computer, bro. Looks like some kind of gate is in her way.
[19601.14s -> 19608.18s]  I did forward four times. One, two, three, four. There are four dots. What are you talking about?
[19614.62s -> 19622.77s]  Forward. Forward. Forward. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. I'm going to stop. ISIS. Forward.
[19622.77s -> 19641.52s]  Forward. Forward. Right. Right. Right. Go. You start on the first one. Forward. Forward. Right.
[19641.52s -> 19659.89s]  This dog is not doing the correct thing. Is it, will it go until it hits a wall? Forward one.
[19661.02s -> 19673.86s]  Forward. Then right? Right. Left. Left. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Forward. Right.
[19673.86s -> 19686.99s]  Okay, well there is, I can't go past the gates. I have to get to the jump over the gate. Okay,
[19686.99s -> 19695.90s]  what if, okay, forward jump? Forward. Jump. Jump. Let's just see what that does. ISIS. Forward.
[19695.90s -> 19702.37s]  Jump. Go. You start at the first dot. Yeah, well then why, why did, why did the dog go five dots?
[19702.37s -> 19710.45s]  I said three forwards, not five. I said forward once here. Okay, you just go until you hit something.
[19710.45s -> 19728.64s]  I, can somebody please explain to me what on earth is going on right now? Is it four circles is one
[19728.64s -> 19738.08s]  forward? So would it be forward, forward, jump? Forward. Jump. ISIS. Forward. Forward. Jump. Go.
[19738.08s -> 19749.89s]  Every intersection is a command. Will I end up in the, whatever this is in the middle here?
[19749.89s -> 19771.81s]  Looks like some kind of gate is in her way. Forward. Right. Forward. Right. Does that actually
[19771.81s -> 19794.99s]  work though? I feel like this is not working. Forward. Right. Go. Forward. Right. Okay, forward.
[19794.99s -> 19810.99s]  Right. Forward. Jump over the hole and then pop. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. What about under
[19810.99s -> 19822.66s]  the gate? Down. Each command is an obstacle. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. Forward. Left.
[19822.66s -> 19834.18s]  Right. Left. Jump. ISIS. Forward. Left. Right. Left. Jump. Go. Why'd you just do left? Somebody said it.
[19834.18s -> 19839.86s]  Right. Left. Not. Right. Chat is moving so fast. I'm sorry I got the one guy that gave me the
[19839.86s -> 19857.36s]  fucking bogus directions. Looks like some kind of gate is in her way. I can't even take it anymore.
[19857.36s -> 19865.12s]  Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. Go. Forward. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. Go. ISIS. Forward.
[19865.20s -> 19869.52s]  Right. Left. Right. Jump. Go. We're losing respect for you? I don't think you are. I think everyone
[19869.52s -> 19875.84s]  can look at this and go, this is kind of fucking cheesy. This is cheesy. This is like a stinky
[19875.84s -> 19899.15s]  cheese. My respect for you went up actually. Yeah, thanks. Now what? What did we just do to the dog?
[19905.65s -> 19924.58s]  We beamed him up into outer space. Now what? Okay, that was just Liam Neeson jumping over a fence
[19924.58s -> 19943.87s]  with 12 cuts. I could have just walked up that easily, right? Like we didn't have... Now where
[19943.87s -> 19958.70s]  am I going? A moose, a wolf, a raccoon, and a pig. The same animals Trapper Dan mentioned in his
[19958.70s -> 19963.50s]  journal when it came to getting into his needle without the key. I'll bet that's what's behind
[19963.50s -> 19968.86s]  this wall. A room below the needle. Next thing I have to do is get each of these panels open.
[19968.86s -> 20001.94s]  Bro, what is this game? I have to get all the panels open? Where's the dog? Oh, I have two
[20001.94s -> 20050.30s]  coins. Okay, what about right? Oh, hi. Good job, I think. And then no nine-year-olds beating this
[20050.30s -> 20053.66s]  game. Nine-year-olds gonna cry. They're gonna get to a point they're gonna be crying because it's
[20053.66s -> 20062.83s]  just... A nine-year-old will cry. No way. Should have picked the child. Should have picked the
[20062.83s -> 20074.96s]  children. Fucking difficulty. Okay, I need to obviously flip up all these switches and have
[20074.96s -> 20082.37s]  all four of the infinity stones. I need to get all of the stones and then come back here again
[20082.37s -> 20101.23s]  and then do all this bullshit again. I mean, that's what I have to do. That's what I have to do.
[20106.37s -> 20134.53s]  I have to... I can't do this. This is a punishment. It kind of is. Okay, this four switches in the
[20134.53s -> 20142.83s]  tunnel. But I'm gonna need the four horsemen of the apocalypse. I need the other two coins. Oh,
[20142.83s -> 20153.31s]  it's too late to walk back to the lodge now. I'd better spend the night here. When you make the
[20153.31s -> 20157.39s]  dog pull the rope, you're on a timer. You have to run back to the lodge and get the pig token and
[20157.39s -> 20162.30s]  the pig head. Is that accurate? Because if it is, I cannot understand how that would be a thing.
[20162.30s -> 20189.73s]  That's not accurate. Oh, that can't be right. The timer is reset now. Do I actually have to do this
[20189.73s -> 20219.65s]  again? A whole day went by. I slept in the shack. The timer reset? Did the timer actually reset?
[20219.65s -> 20233.52s]  No way. Do you have to beat the guy at that coyote game three times now? No, I don't.
[20233.52s -> 20262.77s]  You're making it up. Nancy, what is going on? Nancy, what is going on with this one?
[20262.77s -> 20272.62s]  Why is there a sleep mechanic in the game? You know what I mean? Like, why is there like,
[20272.62s -> 20283.81s]  go go to bed and reset stuff? No, why is it? Why do I have to do people's laundry? What's going on
[20283.81s -> 20310.27s]  in this game? I'm not even here. I'm about to watch the rest of this on YouTube. And by this,
[20310.27s -> 20314.67s]  I mean, they just like what happens at the end. Chantal's on the phone, Nancy. Oh my god. I don't
[20314.67s -> 20346.05s]  stop being a negative Nancy. I can't believe I actually have to go back. Chantal's counting
[20346.05s -> 20352.13s]  on me to get those rooms cleaned. I should go do that. Is there a why is there a clean the rooms
[20352.13s -> 20360.86s]  mechanic? Why? Nobody wants to do what I'm doing right now. I don't want to. I want to solve the
[20360.86s -> 20376.78s]  fucking murder mystery. Why is there a go up and clean the room mechanic? What is this for? I don't
[20376.78s -> 20382.06s]  care. Fuck off. I don't care. I'll close it. I'm not going to even go over there. My jacket. I'm
[20382.06s -> 20400.70s]  getting a definite feeling I'm not wanted here. My jacket. Okay. I know who did it. We already
[20400.78s -> 20413.95s]  we've done this for like an hour and a half. Is there a room done or what? I think I'm good. I
[20413.95s -> 20421.66s]  need not just leave. I don't get call me again. Why is she not wearing the jacket? Yeah. I do. I
[20421.66s -> 20426.30s]  actually have to have the dog pull that and run back here. I really hope that's not bait. I can't
[20426.30s -> 20439.25s]  go anywhere. I still haven't cleaned all those rooms. Oh my god. I do. I have to actually do
[20439.25s -> 20446.43s]  the laundry too. This late in the game. You're going to maybe do the fucking laundry. I'm pissed
[20446.43s -> 20453.15s]  right now. We're like moments away from solving the mystery. Make sure you go clean the rooms
[20453.15s -> 20465.10s]  and shit. Let me finish the game. I don't want to cook lunch and go clean. Why? What earth do I
[20465.10s -> 20502.21s]  have to do this? I'm livid right now. I click too fast and the game operates on six screens in this
[20502.21s -> 20517.22s]  hallway. I don't even know if I'm getting it all. I'm just trying to rush because this is a crap.
[20517.22s -> 20529.20s]  This is a crap part of the game and we all know it. Why am I reviewing this old Nancy Drew game
[20529.20s -> 20544.69s]  from 2007 like it came out last night? I don't know and I don't care. Much better. I'm really
[20544.69s -> 20576.27s]  cold. I can't. Get me the fuck out of here. The pig head thing is not bait. My wife plays these
[20576.27s -> 20584.00s]  games and is very upset. Also the wolf token is in the basement. I really actually have to do that?
[20584.00s -> 20614.67s]  Wait. You should back down here. What's happening right now? Okay. Okay. I was going to say I'm not
[20614.67s -> 20638.54s]  going to do that again, right? Okay. We need to have him do all the levers so let's just get it
[20638.54s -> 20648.58s]  over with. So with that being said, we need to do all the levers. We need to get it over with.
[20648.58s -> 20670.00s]  Apologize to his wife. Why? Because I said this game sucks? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
[20670.00s -> 20680.46s]  I'm kidding. Relax. It's a joke. I could never say that about the Drew crew and Nancy Drew. Come on.
[20680.46s -> 20687.84s]  I've just eaten at least three pieces of this chapstick in frustration over the last hour and
[20687.84s -> 20694.72s]  25 minutes. I would never say something like that about the Drew crew. Speaking of the Drew crew,
[20694.72s -> 20705.41s]  they could give me a quick hand here. Just give me the exact combination to do all this.
[20705.41s -> 20710.11s]  Speaking directly to the Drew crew right now. Just give me the exact combination.
[20710.11s -> 20714.32s]  We all know I don't want to do this. We know you don't want to do it either, but one of us has to.
[20716.40s -> 20721.78s]  And we all know it ain't going to be me. I'm busy looking directly into the center of the screen and
[20721.78s -> 20733.74s]  not moving my arms. Everybody else do it. Show us the map. I can't alt tab this game either. That's
[20733.74s -> 20740.67s]  the problem. Wait. Here's the combination. Oh shit. Somebody actually has it. I can't even bark.
[20740.67s -> 20757.06s]  It's so easy. This really isn't. It's easy if you like, I've checked out. I clocked out like 30, 40
[20757.06s -> 20761.36s]  minutes ago. I'm not kidding. Like it would be easy if I like looked at this map and was like,
[20761.36s -> 20765.84s]  oh, like one, two, three, five, two, four, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. I checked out.
[20765.84s -> 20773.84s]  I checked out like 30 minutes ago. They took bark off this too, which I wouldn't you check out as
[20773.84s -> 20794.27s]  well. I fucked up my shower. You should have called somebody. Okay. Forward. Forward. Left.
[20795.15s -> 20822.61s]  Paw. Forward. Left. Left. Paw. Isis. Forward. Left. Left. Paw. Go. Looks like some kind of gate
[20822.61s -> 20835.68s]  is in her way. That's not right. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. And then I have to run out.
[20835.68s -> 20842.61s]  Do I have to, I probably, do I have to do something else to get those bars to move?
[20842.61s -> 20855.36s]  Or was it forward. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. What was it? Forward. Right. Left. Right.
[20855.36s -> 20870.59s]  Jump. Isis. And then I have to run out of here. Right. Left. Right. Jump. Go. You've opened the
[20870.59s -> 20878.64s]  red gates. You need to win the Fox game on those three sides. This game was not for kids. It
[20878.64s -> 20894.43s]  wasn't. There's no way it was. I played it as a kid. Yeah. And we all know you gave up after the
[20894.43s -> 20906.80s]  first explosion. You were like, whoa. All right. I'm doing something else. Pull it. Now run. Go,
[20906.80s -> 20932.93s]  go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go. Hurry, hurry. Mom's never going to let him play Diablo.
[20932.93s -> 20936.29s]  I think I'm conceding that I'm not going to be playing Diablo tonight because this is the whole
[20936.29s -> 20950.16s]  stream. It was fun though. I had fun. I hope you guys had fun. It's been a great time.
[20950.16s -> 20958.26s]  As frustrated as I've been at some of this. No, the slide puzzles. No, the slide puzzles get you.
[20958.26s -> 20971.63s]  They really do. No, I'm having fun. Everyone at the beginning of 2020, I can handle anything.
[20971.63s -> 20977.47s]  2020, nevermind. Is it just me or has 2020 felt like one long game of Fox and Geese?
[20977.47s -> 20998.67s]  That's from the official Nancy Drew account. What? That's the official Nancy Drew account said that.
[20998.67s -> 21004.62s]  They made their game harder than Dark Souls and Dark Souls wouldn't even out yet. So
[21005.18s -> 21015.50s]  they were the original Dark Souls. Much better. I was really cold. Okay. Oh no, go, go, go. Don't
[21015.50s -> 21039.55s]  talk to, don't stop and talk to Chad for a second. Oh, I need to play. Well, sorry to bother you.
[21041.87s -> 21056.75s]  Don't we play this? Now go into the basement. Okay. What's, what's going on in the basement?
[21057.23s -> 21063.07s]  It's gone in case you didn't know. Just up and left. Oh, Chantal's not going to like that.
[21063.07s -> 21067.71s]  The good news is you don't have to do the cooking anymore. I can handle it from here on out.
[21067.71s -> 21074.13s]  Thank God. I'll let you get back to work. By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the
[21074.13s -> 21101.46s]  rooms were cleaned. So I put it back up at the front desk. Oh no. Let's see. Do I really want
[21101.46s -> 21110.06s]  to go outside without a coat? I don't think so. I can't go outside. Not without a coat. It's too cold.
[21110.94s -> 21125.63s]  Let's see. Do I really want to go outside without a coat? What do I do about that? What's radioactive
[21125.63s -> 21140.88s]  right here? I need a coat. Didn't I, I didn't, I didn't click on it. I had, do I actually have to
[21140.88s -> 21144.80s]  get my coat on? I did. I clicked on it. It was a note on it, but I didn't pick it back up. I thought
[21144.80s -> 21191.41s]  I did. Where's my coat? This isn't even my room. This is my room. Where's my coat? There's, there's
[21191.41s -> 21212.86s]  a reading here. Yeah. It's this, it's this thing right here. 13. See the reading at the bottom left.
[21213.10s -> 21217.60s]  Go down to the main floor. Go right and go left side of the kitchen door. There's a high reading
[21217.60s -> 21225.78s]  by the dinosaur bow and stool decor. Go down to the basement. Go forward after they get another
[21225.78s -> 21229.46s]  high reading. After the stairs and the cellar door, face the stairs and get the highest reading.
[21229.46s -> 21247.50s]  Wasn't I just, I was just, I was just standing there. Do I have to get a reading from everything
[21247.50s -> 21264.58s]  that needs to be read before I can do that? Click the bottom stair. What in the, do I have them all
[21264.58s -> 21277.39s]  now? I didn't know. One, two, three, four. I got them all. All right. We're almost there. We're
[21277.39s -> 21286.10s]  almost there. I have to beat this guy three times. This is going to be a nightmare. I'm just going to
[21286.10s -> 21290.50s]  click in random places until I get it. I'll put up like a family guy clip compilation or something
[21290.50s -> 21297.62s]  in the corner if I can't do it. Please just leave me alone. I'm just, I'm trying to literally walk
[21297.62s -> 21312.38s]  up the stairs, but I have to walk in a full circle to go up the stairs. No, I have to go to, I have
[21312.38s -> 21347.52s]  a sleep cycle. Go to bed and wake up and play the guy. It's too early. Go back to bed. Get, get,
[21347.52s -> 21363.50s]  get, I wish I could just click on the room. Where is this guy? Where is this? Why would he never be
[21363.50s -> 21368.70s]  here? Why would there be a code, a line of code where he wouldn't be sitting here? It's 3 PM.
[21369.26s -> 21426.06s]  Go back to the mines. Back to the mines. I have all the tokens, but all I, I can't,
[21427.34s -> 21434.88s]  I need to open the gates, the red gates. If I don't have the red gates open, I can't do anything.
[21435.36s -> 21440.93s]  So how do I get the red gates to open? Play this guy three times, but he's not even here.
[21440.93s -> 21453.76s]  Do I have to go to bed until he comes back? You don't have to. Oh my God. You don't have to.
[21453.76s -> 21473.55s]  All right. Well then I'm, all right, I'm going. Got all the coins. So you have to play the game.
[21473.55s -> 21479.65s]  Well, they didn't code him in to be there. He's not there. Something tells me I shouldn't be
[21479.65s -> 21487.02s]  making this much noise. Not when I'm walking in a place called Avalanche Ridge. Where are my shoes?
[21487.66s -> 21516.69s]  You should play something else. I feel like we're in way too deep and we were in way too
[21516.69s -> 21529.06s]  deep after I said I would play this today. I haven't completed a Nancy Drew game in two or
[21529.06s -> 21546.88s]  three years. The lanterns in here are basically just rocks hung in cages. I wonder what makes
[21546.88s -> 21551.92s]  the rocks glow like that. I don't know, but I wouldn't be breathing in that deeply because
[21551.92s -> 21582.64s]  it's like, apparently like it's radiation. Next thing I have to do is get each of these panels
[21582.64s -> 21610.18s]  open. Glad I just came all the way to do that. You actually have to beat him three more times.
[21616.82s -> 21620.58s]  Why is he not just sitting there? If that, if that is like a core
[21621.46s -> 21628.05s]  thing you have to do to beat the game, why would he, how would anybody, he needs to be sitting there
[21628.05s -> 21634.21s]  at the table ready to play. Not, not there and not sleeping. He needs to be sitting at the table.
[21634.21s -> 21670.21s]  Dude, you got to get out of there. The uranium is getting to your brain. All right. Let's go back
[21670.21s -> 21681.30s]  and play. I can't believe I have to play this game three more times. Yeah. I've got the pig token.
[21681.30s -> 21725.38s]  Set your alarm clock to earlier in the day to bury these games in a fucking landfill. Like they
[21725.38s -> 21742.30s]  did ET warm again. How about another game of Fox and Geese? How about another game of Fox and Geese?
[21742.30s -> 21749.81s]  Now you're talking. Have a seat. Ready? You don't mind if we at least little pig I found. Do you
[21749.81s -> 21759.20s]  mind if we use this little pig I found in place of the Fox piece? Fine by me. And now what? Now
[21759.20s -> 21765.28s]  what do I have to do? I have to corner. Well, I have to have to in different directions.
[21766.61s -> 21780.26s]  Heard the pig by surrounding with a geese squares. Good luck. But is this just the same game or is it
[21780.26s -> 21801.52s]  different somehow? Do I have to corner him in this corner over here? You've got to be shitting me.
[21801.52s -> 21824.78s]  You're going to be shitting me. There's no way there's, I actually, you have to do this.
[21824.78s -> 21840.16s]  All right. I'm going to move them over to the raccoon and I guess this won't be that bad. It's
[21840.16s -> 21857.62s]  going to be bad to do the pig though. Put him in the pig corner. Dude, this sucks. Okay. Oh my God.
[21857.62s -> 21881.36s]  You know what? You know what? I'm about to pull a plug on this. This is, this sucks. Okay. Have we
[21881.36s -> 21920.70s]  start over? I have an ad. Hold on. Give me 10 minutes. This looks so, so fucking annoying.
[21921.50s -> 21925.34s]  Okay. This sucks. I'm going to have to take this physically forever.
[21928.70s -> 21933.65s]  No, family guy has brought to you in part by that commercial you just saw.
[21947.09s -> 21955.06s]  Why did they pad Nancy Drew to be like a nine to 10 hour game? Like they got to the end here
[21955.70s -> 21964.18s]  and instead of just ending the game, they put like a two hour padding on it. Why? Why is there,
[21964.18s -> 21970.91s]  why do I have to, why is there at least a 45 minute to an hour padding on the final part of the game?
[21970.91s -> 21978.53s]  I don't remember the other Nancy Drew games doing this. You know what? I'm not,
[21978.53s -> 22262.26s]  I don't care about a guide. We're doing it my way. Now get up there. I was right there. Get me. Shit.
[22262.26s -> 22267.55s]  Is the mic off? No, I'm just really trying to focus because I don't want to lose this because
[22267.55s -> 22306.70s]  I almost got them up there. Here. Nobody knows what you're doing. I'm, yeah, they do. I'm trying to
[22306.70s -> 22325.50s]  trap the pig up here. I'm kind of, I'm this one maybe just to get it in here. No, no, no. Back,
[22325.50s -> 22345.98s]  move it back. Got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. All right. He ain't going anywhere. I got him.
[22345.98s -> 22373.17s]  So then this is go in the middle. It can't get me from anywhere in the middle. I will be able to go
[22373.17s -> 22381.20s]  up when he does. Now I'm not getting cocky because he's probably going to go, he's probably going to
[22381.20s -> 22386.78s]  go down and then I'm going to move the one that's left up. All right. That's, that's still good for
[22386.78s -> 22422.85s]  us. We can trap him here. That's even, that's better for us. We're good. I fucked it up. I fucked it
[22422.85s -> 22446.72s]  up. I ruined everything. I ruined it. Didn't I? Fucked it up. I fucked it up. I'm good. No, I'm good.
[22446.72s -> 22456.13s]  I got him. I win.
[22464.98s -> 22466.26s]  But this time I want to use a different one.
[22479.52s -> 22484.80s]  I want to replace my, wait, do I want to, was it, do I have to use a different coin?
[22484.80s -> 22497.97s]  Why can I not use a different coin? It's just the pig pile you use.
[22498.85s -> 22505.76s]  Oh, I thought it was like pig went up there, raccoon coin. Okay. So it doesn't matter. All right.
[22505.76s -> 22585.09s]  Well, let's just even get them over here. Are we quiet? Did I do that before? What? Oh, no, no,
[22585.09s -> 22590.86s]  no, no, no, no. Stay over there. Stay over there. You're, we're good. Stay over there. I just won.
[22590.86s -> 22600.06s]  I just beat him. I just beat him. Hold on. He's over here. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[22600.06s -> 22625.31s]  God damn it. He can get out. I can't block him. You went in three moves. I don't know what those
[22625.31s -> 22638.08s]  moves are. I know I can, but give me a hand here. I don't want to fuck around. And one in the middle
[22638.08s -> 22687.17s]  is what I want to do. Okay. So where do I go? Middle one, middle down left, right? Middle diagonal left.
[22697.84s -> 22711.09s]  All right. So, this thing's dead. I can't move anything here. This is, he's going to get out,
[22711.09s -> 22724.16s]  move it back. Nah, he's going to get out. I guess I'm going to try to do what I was doing before and
[22724.16s -> 22784.27s]  just get him over here. Okay. Now get out of here. There we go. Okay. I'm in such a bad position,
[22784.27s -> 22810.13s]  though, to try to get him to, I'm just going to start moving shit. Like I have to. Okay. Move
[22810.13s -> 22927.46s]  forward this one. Good. Don't go that way. Do not go that way, please. Thank you. That's fine. This
[22927.46s -> 22933.30s]  dude can't be fucking safe. Yes. Dude, I, all right. For those of you that don't know, I have to get
[22933.30s -> 22938.50s]  him in each one of these stupid ass slots. They tweeted about this. This was a meme to their
[22938.50s -> 22942.50s]  development team. They even said, wow, it's like, well, really it wasn't fucking, wow,
[22942.50s -> 22950.19s]  it was something, wasn't it? They are, they did that. The game devs already told you that this was
[22950.19s -> 22963.23s]  a long ass, stupid ass part of the game. Okay. I'm just participating. I don't know. Hold on.
[22963.23s -> 22998.18s]  He needs to go back up. Actually kind of good, I think. I can't go that way. Get up here. Build
[22998.18s -> 23008.46s]  the edges. Yeah, but he only moves into, he won't go up there. See? Like get the, stop going. He
[23008.46s -> 23012.78s]  goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Just go up here and try to kill something.
[23012.78s -> 23020.64s]  Because if I put this down here, he's going to go up here and then he's going to go bunk, bunk, bunk.
[23020.64s -> 23069.39s]  Don't do it. He's going to go down here and he's going to jump me. If I go right here, he's going
[23069.39s -> 23083.55s]  to go back to that one and he's going to jump over my ass. He's definitely not going to go into the
[23083.55s -> 23099.84s]  corner. I mean, this is, I could just see what he does. He's going to move backwards. I got to get
[23099.84s -> 23115.90s]  this, I got to get a piece down in the corner. Why is he doing that? Wait, no, no, he can't go
[23115.90s -> 23133.95s]  that way. He can't go diagonal. Can he? Wait, I think he can. That's freaking me out. No, he
[23133.95s -> 23145.65s]  definitely can't. Okay. Okay. This is in the right spot. Go back up there. All right. Now let me see
[23145.65s -> 23152.10s]  what happens if I do this. Okay. He'll only go there and there. If I move this down here, he's
[23152.10s -> 23162.75s]  going to move probably down, right? He's going to jump that. This has to come down. Damn it.
[23163.39s -> 23191.44s]  Because if I block this and he jumps, he does a double jump. I don't, I don't know how I'm going
[23191.44s -> 23198.69s]  to get him to stay over here. Cause it seems like he has an escape every time. Sacrifice a middle
[23198.69s -> 23204.48s]  piece to make him jump into the corner. That's not a bad idea. Put this here and just make him
[23204.48s -> 23209.42s]  jump over here. I guess I could do that. I hope it's not going to be a problem, but I guess we're
[23209.42s -> 23235.89s]  going for it. Okay. Now, now he's trapped in here. There's now nowhere for him to go. He could go
[23235.89s -> 23244.00s]  this way if he wants to, which, okay. So hold on. If he moves to the left, he's going to jump this
[23244.08s -> 23264.99s]  or down. I need to block this. He's, I mean, he's going to go up, stop and look. I know,
[23264.99s -> 23281.15s]  but these games are so just, it's just brain mush. The experience, the bottom piece, like this one,
[23281.15s -> 23287.97s]  he's, he's going to jump up. They just, somebody had a bet in their game studio. Like,
[23287.97s -> 23292.53s]  can we make a Nancy Drew game, a 20 hour game? No, impossible. I'll just make them do this five
[23292.53s -> 23308.06s]  times. Oh, done. We did it. He can jump this. I have to block this or he's gone.
[23308.06s -> 23323.10s]  Okay. Now he can't move diagonal. So if he goes down, he could jump to the left,
[23323.10s -> 23380.78s]  but that's fine. Cause I can move this here and I think we got them. Not quite. I don't know what
[23380.78s -> 23409.06s]  to do. Ah, you beat me. Another win. Another set of red eyes. All right. No, one more, one more.
[23409.06s -> 23504.61s]  I took it to this one more time and we went, okay. If we start over, get in there. Why are you doing
[23504.61s -> 23596.59s]  that? Get in there. What the fuck did you just do? What did you just do to me? What did you just do?
[23598.16s -> 23614.14s]  Get over there. What's happening? Okay. If we start over, my fucking God,
[23614.14s -> 23624.77s]  this is the stupidest fucking thing ever. Kidding me, man. Like, it's just like, I, who won?
[23624.77s -> 23630.19s]  Nobody wants to do this puzzle. I, I guarantee you, all of you that have ever played this,
[23630.19s -> 23638.48s]  probably saw this happen and you went, Oh, fuck. No. Who wanted to do this? I don't even know
[23638.48s -> 23642.21s]  anybody that would even make this. That would say, you know what? I want to do this five times.
[23642.21s -> 23647.73s]  Who would ever want to do this five times in a row? Unless you download the Fox and the fucking goose
[23648.62s -> 23655.49s]  game. That's like what I'm trying to do. That's what I'm doing. Like who wants to play this?
[23655.49s -> 23671.71s]  Besides people that actively are looking to play the Fox and the goose game. It was so close too,
[23671.71s -> 23745.18s]  but it's just, God, hurry off. Wait, you can't go that way. You, where was this one? Yeah, yeah,
[23745.18s -> 23757.47s]  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's one o'clock in the morning. What happened? Oh my God. It's 1 a.m.
[23757.47s -> 23790.64s]  I must got you, you motherfucker. Go that way. You're in trouble. I must got you, you motherfucker.
[23790.64s -> 23867.47s]  That's the correct play here. What do I do? Top one. Can you screw me if I move this here?
[23867.47s -> 23875.52s]  As long as I move this and then the one right next to the right. If I go this one here and then this
[23875.52s -> 23887.22s]  one here, he can't do anything, right? No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm seeing a lot of nos. He'll take
[23887.22s -> 23906.67s]  the piece above it. Will he though? He doesn't have anywhere to go. I think that's correct.
[23906.67s -> 23916.75s]  Yeah, it is correct because now that's fine. I can sacrifice that one. Now he's in a bad spot.
[23916.75s -> 23936.61s]  Oh my God. I couldn't hold that one. You can't. Wait, wait, wait. He can't go this way. He can't.
[23936.61s -> 23943.71s]  He has to go left. Fill out the corners. Wait, wait. I know. I just have been doing this for
[23943.71s -> 23952.00s]  so long and my brain is having problems. I think it's fine. This moves here, right? Or do I just
[23952.00s -> 23964.62s]  try to block him now? If I move this here, he has to go left. Block the middle one and then take the
[23964.62s -> 23975.71s]  top one, top left. This one goes top left now. He can't go anywhere. He really can't do much of
[23975.71s -> 24045.06s]  anything. I win soon. Give me my token now. Another set of red eyes. Give me my token right now.
[24045.06s -> 24056.69s]  That's it. I win. This game over. I thought the building was on fire. Let's go. Let's go. All
[24056.69s -> 24063.95s]  right. Let's get out of here. It's like I was convinced that the building was on fire. Way too
[24063.95s -> 24075.84s]  cold to go out there now. I have to do it one more time? No, I don't. I already beat him once.
[24075.84s -> 24087.17s]  No, no, no, no. It's only three. It's only three. It's not one more. They all have to be red. Yeah,
[24087.17s -> 24093.14s]  no, that's the one guy. Okay. No, we're good. This is kind of a lot of guys. I'm getting up
[24093.14s -> 24106.88s]  bright and early in the morning. How do I make this? What time I wake up? Right there. Fine.
[24106.88s -> 24116.26s]  No, not 12 a.m. Oh, that sucks when you do a.m. instead of p.m. I've been there before. Your whole
[24116.26s -> 24123.98s]  life comes crashing down because you've been awoken very rudely and sometimes it's not really,
[24123.98s -> 24127.39s]  you know, you can't go back to bed. So then you just screw it for the rest of the day.
[24127.39s -> 24142.14s]  It sucks. I've been there before. All right, let's go. Time to see the conclusion of Nancy Drew.
[24143.12s -> 24175.23s]  Wilderness of the wild white fox. The title is not correct. Yeah, the title is not correct.
[24175.23s -> 24179.39s]  I get this still. Oh, my God. There's a lot of people still here at one o'clock in the morning.
[24179.39s -> 24183.63s]  Hey, well, we're good. We go till we beat it. I, you know, even if I have a few complaints,
[24183.63s -> 24189.06s]  the game was probably a nine point five out of ten. And then when we had to do the four games of
[24189.06s -> 24193.78s]  reverse, whatever the hell that is, brought it down at least two letter grades at least.
[24194.42s -> 24216.37s]  Now we get to have this fun. Let's see. So I got a picture of it. I've been like screaming,
[24216.37s -> 24221.42s]  too. It's been it's been kind of a wild stream. Sorry about that. Today was going to be like a
[24221.42s -> 24234.91s]  chill day. No cam. Sorry. We'll make up for it next time. All right. Here we go. All the gates are
[24234.91s -> 24245.95s]  open. So we just need forward, forward, jump forward. So forward, forward, forward, jump.
[24245.95s -> 24270.21s]  Let's try it. Four, four, four, jump, Isis, forward, forward, forward, jump, go forward,
[24270.21s -> 24293.86s]  forward, forward, forward, forward, forward, jump. Oh, forget it. Four, four, four,
[24293.86s -> 24303.89s]  jump. Isis, forward, forward, forward, jump, paw, go Australian hours. Yeah, I'll tell you there's
[24303.89s -> 24310.59s]  a lot of I look at the demographics of the channel. There's a lot of people from Australia that watch.
[24310.59s -> 24323.66s]  I actually think it's like the third or fourth demographic highest. So hello Australia, Asia too.
[24323.66s -> 24327.98s]  Yeah, but just just pure demographic wise, Australia is I think number three or four.
[24327.98s -> 24341.62s]  You stream at great Aussie hours. Well, that's good. So that was one. OK, now the other ones
[24341.62s -> 24369.14s]  looks like left, left, paw, left, right, paw. Let's try left, left, left, right, paw, Isis, left,
[24370.02s -> 24379.30s]  right, paw, forward. I think I think Isis goes forward already. Does it account for the first
[24379.30s -> 24399.07s]  intersection? It doesn't. OK, so forward, left, left, right, paw, forward, left, right, paw, Isis,
[24399.07s -> 24416.24s]  forward, left, left, right, paw, go. I go right because forward, left, left. Do I have to turn
[24416.24s -> 24430.83s]  that corner? I think is what I this is left is left, right. What happened? Forward. Do I not need
[24430.83s -> 24434.91s]  OK, so that that corner on the bottom doesn't matter. So it's just forward, left, left, paw.
[24434.91s -> 24449.65s]  You don't need to go right. OK, so forward, left, left, paw, forward, left, paw, Isis, forward, left,
[24449.65s -> 24459.04s]  left, paw, go. There's no intersection there. Yeah, that's true. Why is the cave green? That
[24459.04s -> 24463.04s]  would be all the radiation. And I wish I was making that up, but that's actually what that is.
[24463.04s -> 24481.81s]  All right, one more. This looks like it's forward, right, left, paw, forward, right, left, paw. No,
[24481.81s -> 24493.41s]  wait, forward, right, forward. Technically, that's an intersection. What about jump? Oh, there is a
[24493.41s -> 24507.57s]  jump, right? Hold on. So it's forward, forward, right, right, jump or forward again? Forward,
[24507.57s -> 24516.37s]  jump, forward, right, forward, jump. I think, yeah, I think I have to say it. Yeah, I think I have to
[24516.53s -> 24531.78s]  or jump, left, paw, left, paw, Isis, forward, right, forward, jump, left, paw, go. I think that's right.
[24531.78s -> 24545.22s]  Forward, right. This is an intersection here. So forward again, jump over the hole,
[24545.22s -> 24558.61s]  forward again, taking a left paw. There it is. That was fun. I like that one. I just didn't like
[24558.61s -> 24564.19s]  opening all the gates with the convoluted way to do it. I just gained a leather grade,
[24564.19s -> 24577.39s]  one half leather grade. Drink some water. I have been, I'm hydrated, don't worry. All right,
[24577.39s -> 24584.03s]  that is it. It is now time to go open all this shit up and finally see what's going on in this
[24584.03s -> 24631.63s]  world. It's time to party. We like, we like to party. Skiing guy and Lou, both of them,
[24632.46s -> 24640.50s]  they both did it. You see, Brea, this bag must belong to Lou. Oh my gosh, it's full of explosives.
[24640.50s -> 24645.78s]  Lou is the one who's been making those craters. He lied to me. He has been looking for dinosaur
[24645.78s -> 24667.28s]  bones. Nobody behind me. I'm gonna hear clap. Hello. What is this guy doing? Nancy. Yanni,
[24667.28s -> 24672.93s]  what are you doing here? I was skiing, but when I passed the needle, I saw that there was a door in
[24672.93s -> 24678.13s]  it, a door which was open. So I took off my skis to look and now I'm here. You didn't have to play
[24678.13s -> 24684.13s]  reverse heat for four hours. What do you mean? All I know is I found a bag, Lou Talbot's bag,
[24684.13s -> 24687.65s]  and it's full of explosives. There's just a door to come down here. Who is the one who has been
[24687.65s -> 24693.89s]  blowing up things? He is the bomber. He's been excavating dinosaur bones. He may be responsible
[24693.89s -> 24698.61s]  for a lot of the other stuff that's been going on around here too. You must stay here and guard
[24698.61s -> 24703.57s]  the bag. I will ski back to the lodge very quickly and tell the handyman to call the authorities.
[24703.57s -> 24715.84s]  This guy's full of shit. This guy's full of shit. This is very clear. Yeah, this is the villain.
[24726.11s -> 24726.91s]  There's 990.
[24735.84s -> 24739.36s]  A person who's been wearing that snowmobiling suit and blowing things up
[24739.36s -> 24746.08s]  is Yanni. Geophone data. Uranium. Oh my gosh, he set the timer.
[24748.08s -> 24753.04s]  Oh, there was just a door. We've got to get out of here. I was skiing and I found a door and I
[24753.04s -> 24760.90s]  walked in it. No, it would have been more believable if you told me. I had to play that
[24760.90s -> 24768.99s]  old man at that game that he played to beat him four times. It was very tricky.
[24774.72s -> 24779.04s]  You don't say I found a door. Like, buddy, I've been looking around this place for three weeks.
[24808.96s -> 24821.33s]  Get away from me. Snowmobile race. I hate that I can see all the gross shit on my monitor.
[24832.69s -> 24843.46s]  No way. We both just did that. You know, you have those moments where you just go, man,
[24843.46s -> 24857.06s]  I sneezed like a month ago and it's still right there, isn't it? What the hell? Where are you
[24857.06s -> 24953.66s]  taking him? Get over here. This is so stupid. Oh my goodness. Can I cut across somewhere, maybe?
[24954.86s -> 24968.29s]  I don't know. Yep. That's the play. All right. If we go past there again, I'm going that other way.
[24969.01s -> 25071.41s]  I'm trying to cut him off. God damn it. Oh, no. Oh my God. That's a Wario screamer that was.
[25071.41s -> 25076.69s]  Lying there in the snow, defeated, Yanni owned up to everything. He tainted the potato salad
[25076.69s -> 25081.57s]  with bad mayonnaise. He iced down the back stairs. He opened a gas valve in the sauna.
[25081.57s -> 25086.61s]  He blew up the bunkhouse using the clock he took from Guadalupe's room. And he left those pictures
[25086.61s -> 25091.17s]  of Bill Kessler for me in the sauna. Although he swears the door got stuck by accident in order
[25091.17s -> 25096.61s]  to cast suspicion on someone else. He did all this because he wanted everyone to leave Icicle Creek
[25096.61s -> 25101.73s]  Lodge. Why? Because it turns out that he was actually spying for the government of Fredonia,
[25101.73s -> 25107.33s]  which had sent him to Canada to look for uranium. Apparently his superiors hoped to secretly mine
[25107.33s -> 25112.13s]  what he found and smuggle it back to Fredonia. What they planned to do with it then, even Yanni
[25112.13s -> 25116.85s]  didn't know. But he insisted that he never meant to hurt anyone and that he really was the best
[25116.85s -> 25121.57s]  cross-country skier in the world. Unfortunately, he'll never get a chance to prove that now.
[25124.32s -> 25128.56s]  Chantal has barely been off the phone since she got back to the lodge. It seems that Yanni
[25128.56s -> 25133.52s]  Shenanigans made the nightly news, not just in Canada, but in the States. And as a result,
[25133.52s -> 25138.72s]  people have been booking stays right and left, much to her delight. When I told her and Ollie how
[25138.80s -> 25144.24s]  Isis had helped me, they were truly amazed. Hopefully from now on, Ollie will think twice
[25144.24s -> 25149.60s]  about pulling out his rifle every time he sees a varmint. As for Isis, Guadalupe called me that
[25149.60s -> 25154.56s]  very night and told me she'd found a wolf sanctuary that could take her. How could you tell from the way the
[25154.56s -> 25158.88s]  volunteers from the sanctuary treated her when they came to get her that she'll be in good hands
[25158.88s -> 25164.56s]  at her new home? But still, it's sad that through no fault of her own, she could never run free again.
[25165.04s -> 25170.16s]  They said it's possible that she might someday be released back into the wild, but not very likely.
[25172.80s -> 25180.54s]  I'm going to keep my fingers crossed anyway. I told you. I had it from the very beginning.
[25181.34s -> 25187.63s]  The dog was good. I told you that. You've been awarded the title of
[25189.25s -> 25203.98s]  Dear Detective for Superlatory Sleuthing. Got it? All right. Best suggested we head to New Orleans
[25203.98s -> 25210.62s]  for a short vacation. I thought it was a great idea. The French Quarter, fantastic food, awesome music,
[25210.62s -> 25217.18s]  friendly people, but all it took was one little side trip to check on a friend of Ned's and suddenly
[25217.18s -> 25225.82s]  everything got very strange. A recent death, a musty old mansion, a disturbingly odd curio shop,
[25225.82s -> 25231.90s]  a garden where only secrets seemed to grow, and something as ancient as it was terrifying.
[25232.86s -> 25237.34s]  Join me on my next adventure, Legend of the Crystal Skull.
[25237.98s -> 25244.53s]  I would, Nancy, but unfortunately I'm going to need a shovel to dig out all the buried copies of the game.
[25245.17s -> 25259.38s]  So I did say that that was cute. I liked it. That was cute. It was worth playing it. I'm glad we did it.
[25259.38s -> 25264.58s]  It was a lot of fun to be had lots of funny things. We talked about lots of interesting things we did.
[25265.38s -> 25273.65s]  I liked it. Nancy Drew and the Icicle Wolf of Icicle Creek. Just move those words around.
[25273.73s -> 25283.58s]  To where they belong. So next time you'll see Nancy Drew. Hey, did you really think you were
[25283.58s -> 25289.31s]  going to get a Nancy Drew game today? Yesterday? Did you think you were going to get a Nancy Drew
[25289.31s -> 25295.86s]  game? There's no way that you thought that. And we did it. So I have like 30 of these.
[25296.42s -> 25304.82s]  So we can do another one eventually. And it's fun. You skipped half the game. No, I didn't.
[25304.82s -> 25312.59s]  Half the game was the reverse again. Yeah. With that, I'm going to, I'm going to call it seven
[25312.59s -> 25318.05s]  hours. I think that's a good place to stop. So I'm trying to think of what, is there like a
[25318.05s -> 25336.66s]  post credit scene? You scummed at checkers. Well, I scummed at the coin swap machine thingy. That
[25336.66s -> 25343.47s]  was fun. I had a great time. I always have a great time when I play these. As long as you guys are
[25343.47s -> 25348.03s]  having fun. As long as it's fun to watch and fun to be a part of. That's usually how it works.
[25348.59s -> 25356.38s]  All right. The next stream is going to probably be probably the Resident Evil launch.
[25357.02s -> 25366.13s]  When is that? Two or three days? 23rd, 24th. It's probably the 24th in the middle of the afternoon.
[25379.12s -> 25384.22s]  Because what's probably going to end up happening is I'm going to play that
[25384.22s -> 25395.62s]  just until it's done. I imagine that's going to be probably like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday ordeal.
[25395.62s -> 25404.02s]  How long is Resident Evil for? It's like 15 to 20 hours or something, right? Somewhere in that
[25404.02s -> 25414.58s]  range. Maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less. So that's what we'll do.
[25416.51s -> 25422.80s]  I will see you guys again on the 24th and we're just going to go until I beat it for two or three
[25422.80s -> 25430.19s]  days in a row. That seems like the next logical time for me to come back. Plus that also gives
[25430.19s -> 25439.33s]  me the opportunity for the next few days to get some Grotto Beast stuff situated because as of now
[25439.33s -> 25446.21s]  we're starting to kind of come out of this pre-sale period and there is a couple things to make sure
[25446.21s -> 25460.90s]  go off well. You'll see very soon. I'll see you guys on Friday. Thanks for watching. Friday,
[25460.90s -> 25465.38s]  Saturday, Sunday probably or at least starting on Friday and we're just going for however many
[25465.38s -> 25473.87s]  hours or days it takes to beat Resident Evil 4. And actually the next time you see me I might have
[25473.87s -> 25492.62s]  something interesting to tell you or show you perhaps. We'll see. Maybe. Soon. We'll see.
[25492.62s -> 25503.73s]  Maybe. Not guaranteed but maybe. Alright everybody, see you later. That's the wrong thing. Hey,
[25503.73s -> 25511.17s]  there it is. Thanks for the subs everybody. Thanks for watching. Thanks for supporting the stream.
[25513.02s -> 25517.87s]  Kind of unhinged today but I think Nancy Drew just kind of pulls that out of us,
[25517.87s -> 25531.15s]  me specifically. We'll see you again. I'm very excited for Resident Evil 4. It's getting really
[25531.15s -> 25535.23s]  great reviews although I mean it's a remake of the one that already got really great reviews
[25535.23s -> 25541.07s]  but this one's getting very good reviews too. Making a remake could have the opposite happen
[25541.07s -> 25547.04s]  where it's not as good as the original but apparently this is incredible. Most outlets
[25547.04s -> 25554.86s]  are giving this high nines even tens so I'm very very excited because I love the fourth game.
[25554.86s -> 25560.70s]  I've played through it many times at least three or four times many times. We'll see how it holds
[25560.70s -> 25572.69s]  up. I'm very excited. The Resident Evil 2 remake was incredible I'm sure. Yeah we talked about it
[25572.69s -> 25577.70s]  in the very beginning of the stream. It'd be kind of funny if because I gave Resident Evil 2 a remake
[25577.70s -> 25582.48s]  game of the year. It'd be funny if I give this it was just two remakes in three years getting
[25582.48s -> 25589.79s]  game of the year for me. Alright let's raid somebody. I want to you know what I want who I
[25589.79s -> 25615.94s]  want to raid. Let me bring up their stream. Let's get a raid going. I want to raid. Oh let me see.
[25616.66s -> 25627.57s]  I want to raid Seadog. Seadog VA. Seadog's currently doing a charity cycle-a-thon from
[25627.57s -> 25644.30s]  Nagasaki to Kumamoto. Big charity cycle-a-thon. Go say hello. Connor is an awesome dude. Seadog go
[25644.30s -> 25664.30s]  say hi. Charity liker. That's right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching. Take care
[25664.30s -> 25683.58s]  yourselves. Bye bye. Oh also we've got a few coins to spare. The donation the goal right now is 150k.
[25683.58s -> 25693.22s]  It's currently at 132k. So if you got some spare coin you know where to put it. See you guys soon.
[25693.22s -> 25747.34s]  Take care. Hey you hey we can get this to 10k. We can get this to 10k. Let's get a 10k raid on
[25747.34s -> 25753.60s]  charity stream. Come on let's do it. We can get this to 10k. We can do it. Let's do it. We can get it to 10k.
[25753.60s -> 25768.90s]  Come on. Go go go go go go go go go go go go go. If we don't it's fine. Come on go in.
[25774.66s -> 25780.78s]  I think everyone just left already. It's all right. All right see you guys later. See you on Friday.
[25780.78s -> 25817.04s]  Have a great night. Take care of yourselves. Goodbye.
