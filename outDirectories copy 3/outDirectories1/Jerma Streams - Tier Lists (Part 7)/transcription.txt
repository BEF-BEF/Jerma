[0.00s -> 6.35s]  We good? Alright, it's time for us to do the greatest video game of all time. Tear List.
[6.35s -> 17.71s]  This is gonna- oh my god, this is gonna take a while. And I'm too red! This is gonna take all
[17.71s -> 28.56s]  fucking- I- I just was looking for some stuff to do real quick. That better? That better. Alright,
[28.56s -> 33.76s]  let's uh, let's start with- okay, this is- so this is the best game that I've ever played, right?
[33.76s -> 38.38s]  He's played like five games on this list. More than that, at least eight. Or ten.
[41.54s -> 50.61s]  But what actually have I played? Alright, let me get the ones that I'm certain of. Alright, Team
[50.61s -> 59.68s]  Fortress 2 is- is- is a masterpiece. It goes up here. What else is on here that's an absolute
[59.68s -> 67.28s]  masterpiece? That I know for a fact is like up at absolute masterpiece level. It's Resident Evil 4?
[67.28s -> 72.43s]  Resident Evil 4 is up here pretty close. Not- I wouldn't say the whole way. I'm not done with this
[72.43s -> 83.50s]  yet. We're gonna- we're gonna go to great. Um, Battlefield 1. I don't- I don't think that's-
[83.50s -> 96.00s]  I don't know if that should be on here. Battlefield 1? On the greatest video games have ever made list.
[96.00s -> 105.26s]  Okay, but if it's the gr- okay, if every single game on here could be the greatest game ever made,
[105.26s -> 112.46s]  they're not necessarily horrible games, are they? I'm gonna put it- I'm gonna keep it here. It's
[112.46s -> 124.94s]  gonna go down. Okay, um, XCOM 2. I've had never played it. Oh shit, Smite's on here. Smite on here.
[124.94s -> 129.66s]  Alright, but here I'm gonna be fair. It's a Smite. I think- I think Smite's more fun than Battlefield
[129.66s -> 142.27s]  1. I am- I am certain of that. Which one is this? Is it Smash Brothers Brawl or Smash-
[142.67s -> 149.78s]  Smash Brothers in general? I think that's Brawl. Hold on, I just gotta get this situated.
[149.78s -> 153.46s]  I don't- War- I don't wanna say Warframe is horrible, but I don't think it's the best game
[153.46s -> 165.90s]  ever made. I don't want it to be horrible, though. Okay, alright, let me ask you this.
[166.54s -> 174.51s]  If I have less than, like, two to three hours in the game, should it be under have not tried the
[174.51s -> 181.62s]  game? Because if I have less than five hours in the game, they're going down here. I don't even
[181.62s -> 186.03s]  think it's hor- okay, I'm just gonna- I'm just gonna leave it here. No. I think it's better than
[186.03s -> 190.46s]  Battlefield 1. I think everything's better than Battlefield 1 for me. I don't think there's
[190.46s -> 196.74s]  anything on this list that's worse than Battlefield 1 for me. We'll find out. This is very early.
[196.74s -> 202.16s]  This is League of Legends. I- I don't- I don't play it. That's gonna be at the bottom. God of
[202.16s -> 215.34s]  War 2. I didn't- I never played it. Fallout New Vegas. It's- I know people are gonna- This is-
[216.75s -> 223.41s]  Right now, I am just making myself out to be the ultimate hated person. This is more- This is way
[223.41s -> 233.92s]  different than doing cereal box tier lists. If Fallout New Vegas is not on Masterpiece, I think
[233.92s -> 240.46s]  a lot of you are gonna be very adamant that I'm- You're gonna want to, like, be mad at me.
[241.26s -> 250.38s]  I don't- I'm scared to put that idea- This is- Okay, this- Should I do an on-stream one and an
[250.38s -> 255.92s]  off-stream one and then tweet out the comparison? Oh yeah, Fallout New Vegas is, uh, it's definitely
[255.92s -> 263.22s]  an A-plus tier on-stream, Andy. And then off-stream is, like, down here. No, I'm gonna- I'm gonna do
[263.22s -> 269.90s]  this real. This is for real. This is what I actually really believe. I'm not gonna have anybody
[269.90s -> 274.59s]  fucking tell me what I- I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna have you influence me at all. I think
[274.59s -> 278.99s]  Smite is more fun than Fallout New Vegas. I- It is. I'm sorry. Everyone's gonna be mad at that,
[278.99s -> 285.81s]  but, like, I've had more fun playing- I- I don't know. I just think it is. I like that video game.
[285.81s -> 294.72s]  But this- But is it though? What- Did I- Maybe. On-stream, off-stream. It's close- Hold on. I
[294.72s -> 302.56s]  gotta get more up here. Until Dawn should not be on this list. Why? Half-Life 2 is also not gonna
[302.56s -> 311.82s]  be as high as people want it to be. I don't consider Half-Life 2 to be, like, up at Masterpiece.
[311.82s -> 318.80s]  It's- It's great. It also made me very sick. I don't know why. The boat level in Half-Life 2,
[318.80s -> 324.11s]  when you're in the boat, I had to stop playing every- Oh, this is Half-Life 1. Okay. Well,
[324.11s -> 332.24s]  hold on. Hold on. That still belongs up here. Half-Life 1, you idiot. All right. Half-Life-
[332.24s -> 347.39s]  Is Half-Life 1 more fun than Smite? Careful. Careful. Uh, Castlevania? I don't- I- I don't-
[347.47s -> 360.96s]  I didn't play the one for PlayStation. I'm sorry. Bioshock 1. Bioshock 1 was very good.
[362.66s -> 368.05s]  It's not better- It might be better than Half-Life. Oh my god. People are gonna hate me.
[368.05s -> 373.23s]  But it's kind of not fair though, because it's so- It's like years later.
[373.23s -> 387.15s]  You're gonna stop. Based. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. All right. Well, I'm gonna hold
[387.15s -> 394.11s]  on. I can- Once I get it to where I want it, then I'll be all right. This is Crash Team Racing?
[394.11s -> 398.03s]  I don't know what that is, but I didn't play it. Uncharted all- I've never played an Uncharted
[398.03s -> 400.75s]  game. I don't even have one second in them. I can't even put them on here.
[400.75s -> 407.34s]  Mourninghawk's Pro Skater 2. That's not a masterpiece, but it's up here.
[407.34s -> 411.18s]  Wait. Hold on. Am I allowed to put this up here? Didn't I talk a ton of shit about this game when
[411.18s -> 415.95s]  I was playing? Wasn't I raging? Like, constantly being whiny and annoying when I played this with
[415.95s -> 426.56s]  Dreamcast? I did, right? Okay. Then I can't put it up here. I was- I just kept complaining. Over
[426.56s -> 438.62s]  and over again. Over and over and over again. It's down here. Uh, Call of Duty Mad World 5-3.
[438.94s -> 447.42s]  That is- is not very- it's not good. It's not a good game. It was a fu- it was fun, but it wasn't
[447.42s -> 461.86s]  good. Look, every Call of Duty game can be fun, but it doesn't mean they're good. Like, it's fun- I
[461.86s -> 467.25s]  could just sit there and just, like, be on the phone with somebody. Just like, yeah, yeah, man,
[467.25s -> 478.78s]  yeah. Just playing a little bit of Kill Confirmed. Yeah, what are you up to? Yeah. No, I'll be over
[478.78s -> 483.90s]  in like fucking 20 minutes. Like, you just don't even fucking care. You just like the sound.
[483.90s -> 488.22s]  Actually, and it's something I really actually truly believe, I believe that the Call of Duty
[488.22s -> 495.50s]  hit sound is the only reason why people play the game. I truly believe that. That sound effect is
[495.50s -> 502.86s]  what brings everybody in. Something about it. It's- it's like this- it's this perfect, like,
[502.86s -> 508.22s]  scratching that itch on your back that's right in the middle that sits between your shoulder blades
[508.22s -> 511.90s]  and the middle of your back that you just can't barely get. But the second you get your middle
[511.90s -> 522.66s]  finger up there and you- without that hit sound, that game is a three. With that hit sound, it's
[522.66s -> 539.02s]  about a seven- it's a 6.5. Dark Souls- is Dark Souls one? Is Dark Souls one better than Smite?
[539.02s -> 546.72s]  Yes. Of course it is. That would be outrageous if I thought otherwise. I'm not done with it yet.
[546.72s -> 551.26s]  It's- I don't- hold on. Let me- it's not- don't say Masterpiece yet. I'm only putting things in
[551.26s -> 555.87s]  Masterpiece that I truly can say belong there. Like, right off the bat without even thinking.
[559.95s -> 568.90s]  Some of these will move up. Just wait. I have not played A Hat in Time. Red Dem Redemption 2 was
[569.70s -> 590.86s]  very good. Was it more fun than Smite? Yes. Mass Effect 2? I didn't- is it- okay. I don't like
[590.86s -> 602.05s]  those games. Is that- can I say that? Is it okay to say? I like- I like- don't like Mass Effect.
[602.05s -> 609.76s]  That's okay, right? I don't hate Mass Effect. I don't think it's a shitty game. I just don't like
[609.76s -> 622.75s]  it. That's okay. I can say that, right? That's okay. All right. Yeah. It's definitely better
[622.75s -> 632.67s]  than Until Dawn. But I didn't- I didn't even play it, really. I didn't- why are you asking us?
[632.67s -> 638.06s]  Because sometimes, if I say I don't- you know, if I said I- that Mass Effect 2- remember?
[642.06s -> 648.38s]  If I say Mass Effect 3- if I say Mass Effect 2 sucks, then I'll get tweets about it. People
[648.38s -> 655.52s]  will be like, fuck you, you're an idiot. You don't know anything about video games. I gotta be careful.
[655.52s -> 664.19s]  He's being hacked. I haven't played it, really. I don't- I'm not into the series.
[664.19s -> 674.77s]  Sonic Mania. It's probably- is it- I kind of feel the same way about Sonic the Hedgehog that I do
[674.77s -> 680.82s]  about Modern Warfare 3. The sound effects. Like, I only play Sonic to, like, hold down and go
[685.22s -> 688.48s]  I don't- I don't really care. And for the-
[692.48s -> 697.76s]  And then the-
[698.93s -> 710.03s]  I have trouble playing Sonic the Hedgehog. I feel like I- I have, like, ADHD and it's hard for me
[710.03s -> 717.22s]  to concentrate on a lot of things. So I'll be running very fast and it's just like- and I'll
[717.22s -> 730.85s]  hit like a fucking spike. I can't even pay attention to it. It's better than Smite. Of course it is.
[734.30s -> 745.68s]  If you guys would like to see the definition of recency bias, this is the only video game I've
[745.68s -> 781.79s]  played off stream in the last six months. The only one. But it's fun! It's better- it's better
[781.79s -> 787.57s]  than Warframe. It is. All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What else we got? GTA V.
[787.57s -> 794.14s]  Ah, it's close. I have to come back to this. I think GTA V is, like, one of the better games
[794.14s -> 804.40s]  to come out in the last, at least, like, 10 to 15 years. The GTA V story is, like, all right,
[804.40s -> 811.62s]  it's all right. It was cool. But just- hold on, now that I can give my reason why. The- the world
[811.62s -> 821.04s]  of GTA V is so- it's just peop- it's just people are alive. Just like the pedestrians and the
[821.04s -> 827.89s]  buildings and the mountains and so much time went into that city and that world. People have tried
[827.89s -> 841.47s]  to do that since. Remember, GTA V came out in fucking 2013. 2013. Name me a game that's come
[841.47s -> 849.33s]  out recently that really kind of badly wanted to have that same vibe and it was a disaster.
[856.99s -> 902.94s]  It better not be on this list. What is this doing on here? This definitely was made before
[902.94s -> 915.36s]  the game came up. This list was created probably, like, a couple weeks before that game came up.
[915.36s -> 921.66s]  The Avengers. It's- it's not on here. Okay, it's- I don't think it's on here. Somebody said it's on
[921.66s -> 927.47s]  there, but you don't even know which one I'm talking about, but maybe you do. Is it on here?
[927.47s -> 938.59s]  It's not on here. It's- look at these little icons. I can't even see. Is it on here? It probably is.
[938.59s -> 960.88s]  This was probably made before it even came out. Bottom left. This is the games that I pre-ordered,
[960.88s -> 977.79s]  thinking they were gonna be the best game ever made. Uh, the list. This is unfair because I'm-
[977.79s -> 983.79s]  I'm just, like, bandwagon jumping Andy, right? And I know you're fucking sick of me saying that,
[983.79s -> 987.71s]  but it's- look, that's how- that's how we communicate in this generation. We say Andy.
[987.71s -> 997.02s]  I haven't played Cyberpunk. I just- it's bad because to- everybody told me it was bad.
[997.02s -> 1002.42s]  Cyberpunk's bad because everybody told me it was bad. And I saw a clip of a car, like,
[1003.14s -> 1014.66s]  flipping upside down and, like, deleting. I can't rate it. I can't. I didn't play it.
[1014.66s -> 1022.18s]  It sucks. It's actually really fun. Well, there's two people right next to each other. They got-
[1022.90s -> 1026.50s]  it sucks, but it's fun. All right, so it's like Modern Warfare 3. Are there- wait,
[1026.50s -> 1032.21s]  are there sound effects in this game that- like, is it Modern Warfare 3? Like, when I really load
[1032.21s -> 1039.33s]  the gun, does it go like- so I could just be like, yes. No? Okay, then it stays down here.
[1039.33s -> 1064.67s]  I thought this said Bugleberry. What is that? Jungle Party? Is that a good game? Is this,
[1064.67s -> 1072.40s]  like, a game I've never played? Played Jungle Party. It belongs there. It does? I don't- I have
[1072.40s -> 1079.46s]  no idea what it is. It's a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece.
[1080.18s -> 1089.68s]  This is a paid ad to let it be on here. It does look like an old cereal box CD that was taped
[1089.68s -> 1100.24s]  to the back of the box. I don't- I have no idea what it is. All right. Okay. I only played the
[1100.24s -> 1106.90s]  first four hours or five hours of God of War, the new one, but my goodness was it
[1106.90s -> 1118.11s]  beautiful. It was fantastic. And I've been told that the first three or four hours of God of War
[1118.11s -> 1124.37s]  are ten out of ten, but the rest of God of War is like eight and a half out of ten. That's what I
[1124.37s -> 1129.39s]  have been told. I had the first, like, six hours is like a full ten out of ten, and then the rest
[1129.39s -> 1154.05s]  is like an 8.6. Is that fair? You know, I don't play video games. All the games on this list,
[1154.77s -> 1170.51s]  I think I've played, like, for three to four hours. Dota 2, I've played for, like, three hours.
[1170.51s -> 1175.20s]  Yakuza, I've played for, like, four hours. Street Fighter, I've played probably a total of, like,
[1175.20s -> 1182.67s]  two to three hours. Halo Reach, I played an hour and ten minutes with Joel. Batman, Arkham City,
[1182.67s -> 1187.71s]  I played for, like, two hours because it was on sale for, like, the eighth time. Watch Dogs,
[1187.71s -> 1196.37s]  I played for about three hours on stream. Star Wars, Lego Star Wars, played for about four hours.
[1196.37s -> 1206.66s]  Ooh, Shadow of the Colossus is on here. Now that's a great, yeah, that's amazing. Borderlands 2,
[1206.66s -> 1216.88s]  is this the good one? German, none of them are the good one. Uh, what the fuck, dude?
[1231.01s -> 1239.23s]  Borderlands series, to me, is Overwatch Ultimates with the entirety of the time that you're playing
[1239.23s -> 1249.73s]  the game. That's how I felt. I just kind of felt like I was constantly in an ult in Overwatch.
[1249.73s -> 1266.78s]  Holy shit, he's lost it. I didn't say it wasn't fun. I just remember, like, pressing Q every,
[1266.78s -> 1282.85s]  like, minute, and it was just like, and then I guess we won. Everybody in, like, Borderlands,
[1282.85s -> 1285.73s]  especially the later ones, they have, like, super moves that you can use every minute.
[1290.00s -> 1296.10s]  Get the super moves out of games. Can I say that? Get, take ultimate abilities out of fucking video
[1296.10s -> 1300.46s]  games. It makes them annoying. It makes them stupid. I don't like them. I don't like having
[1300.46s -> 1306.22s]  ultimate abilities that you just press a button and just, and everything dies and you do it once
[1306.22s -> 1311.23s]  every minute or two. No, let me have to fuck, I want to play. I don't want to just press fucking
[1311.23s -> 1320.40s]  Q and have colors light up the screen. That's why Smite deserves to be a little bit higher than it
[1321.04s -> 1340.29s]  is. It's a bad take. I don't think it is, though, because it makes it, look, I know I'm not, like,
[1340.29s -> 1347.02s]  that good at video games, but when you have ultimates in games that just, just level everything in
[1347.02s -> 1352.48s]  front of you, when you play with more than one or two people, you just, you might as well just be
[1352.48s -> 1357.33s]  hanging out talking in a Discord call. You're not even playing. When, like, three of you have a
[1357.33s -> 1362.62s]  fucking Q button to press every two minutes, you're just hanging out and talking in a call
[1362.62s -> 1365.52s]  because it's like, all right, let's go in. You guys ready to go in? Just, like,
[1366.48s -> 1369.36s]  wipe everything out. Oh, we all pressed Q. All right, like, pick up the items, I guess.
[1370.56s -> 1376.11s]  There's another one. There's another fight. This one's a boss. Everyone pressed Q.
[1376.11s -> 1390.46s]  That's unironically correct. Thank you. Going off script now. Just wait till they add an ultimate
[1390.46s -> 1395.76s]  in the next Mario game and then all everybody can come back here and be like, man, you know,
[1396.32s -> 1399.52s]  you were kind of right about that. Just wait till you press, wait till you press, like,
[1399.60s -> 1408.32s]  fucking right bumper in, like, Mario Odyssey 2. And he goes like, and fucking spins and stars
[1408.32s -> 1414.42s]  go everywhere and, like, and everything gets fucking dies around him. Wait till it happens
[1414.42s -> 1430.94s]  and then you tell me I was wrong. You're a psycho. So, I mean, no, I'm not. I didn't play Uncharted
[1430.94s -> 1436.67s]  3. I didn't play fucking Uncharted 2. I didn't play fucking Uncharted 1. Ooh, this one's good.
[1436.67s -> 1456.24s]  That's very good. Whoa, I even said it. I have to put it up here. It doesn't, is there a doesn't
[1456.24s -> 1460.62s]  deserve to be on? I guess this is doesn't deserve to be on the list. All right. I'm changing.
[1460.62s -> 1467.31s]  Horrible is not horrible. Horrible is doesn't deserve to be on the list. That doesn't mean it's
[1467.31s -> 1473.92s]  a bad game. But when you're talking about the greatest video games of all time, I just don't
[1473.92s -> 1482.96s]  think they belong on the list. You got to put, like, you got to put Doom on here somewhere.
[1482.96s -> 1487.30s]  I don't even know what to put it, though. I think I played it for, like, wait, this is the remake.
[1487.30s -> 1502.35s]  I played the remake on stream. Somebody get the exact time. Somebody get the exact time of how
[1502.35s -> 1516.29s]  long I played Doom. Is it more than four and a half hours? Four hours. It was four hours and 27
[1516.29s -> 1531.57s]  minutes. No, I'm way more suited to watch movies. Coming to this realization, if Doom was a movie,
[1531.57s -> 1543.06s]  I could give you, I could give you a good review. After four hours, not even TV shows either.
[1544.34s -> 1550.08s]  TV shows last whole seasons and hours and, like, tens of hours. I'm a movie guy and I'm coming to
[1550.08s -> 1560.93s]  the realization here. Fake Doom fan. It was good. Hold on, let me just mute so I can get rid of this.
[1560.93s -> 1578.59s]  Whatever is wrong with me. Oh, Far Cry, Far Cry, Far Cry 3, dude. I didn't. Wait, is this Far Cry 3?
[1578.59s -> 1595.20s]  I played this on stream for four hours. I played this one off stream for one hour and uninstalled
[1595.20s -> 1608.61s]  it. Mortal Kombat 11 played it for like two hours, three hours. I didn't play Wind Waker. I know,
[1608.61s -> 1616.46s]  I didn't play Breath of the Wild. Finding of Isaac goes up high. No, I don't know if it's,
[1616.46s -> 1624.67s]  it's definitely an amazing, definitely. Final Fantasy, I don't even know which one it is. I
[1624.67s -> 1632.59s]  didn't play it. Watch Dogs 2. Both are bad. I'm sorry, they just are. That's how I, that's what I
[1632.59s -> 1649.22s]  feel. Mario Odyssey. I played for like three and a half hours. I got to the part where you walk in
[1649.22s -> 1656.10s]  the, I got to the part where, like, you walk in the pipe thing and it's like a do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[1656.10s -> 1667.92s]  It's like all nostalgia and then I uninstalled the game. Don't ever listen to a thing I say about
[1667.92s -> 1679.41s]  video games. I have no experience. I am the best indicator for if you've got a good, if you got a
[1679.41s -> 1686.80s]  big first act, a really good first act, you'll know because I'll play the game. Everything that's
[1686.80s -> 1702.05s]  up here, notice how they all have really, really fantastic first acts, with the exception of Isaac.
[1703.04s -> 1718.02s]  Isaac and TF2 are sm- You okay? Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Are you alright? That was probably really
[1718.02s -> 1729.42s]  bad. I'm really sorry. Oh, there's like 16,000 people here. I'm really fucking sorry. I'm really
[1729.42s -> 1736.35s]  sorry. But these, you can do Binding of, you can play, you can beat Binding of Isaac technically
[1736.35s -> 1743.36s]  in 30 minutes, 20 minutes. TF2, you just jump in a server and just walk around with a flog and just
[1743.36s -> 1747.92s]  burn people, light them on fire and crit them and get them to yell fucking swears at you in chat.
[1747.92s -> 1756.66s]  It's, you, it's, you don't have to do anything. You know, it literally takes five minutes.
[1756.66s -> 1763.73s]  All these have great first acts. I'm, this is a complete eye-opener. I don't, I didn't play any
[1763.73s -> 1778.08s]  Assassin's Creed. No, I don't play FIFA. I don't play Fortnite. Oh boy, what a first act this had.
[1779.73s -> 1788.80s]  The cinematic cutscene, getting into Dun Moro as the, as a dwarf, getting the, the voice lines
[1788.80s -> 1794.64s]  and collecting the stuff and getting going and going to meet, uh, Anduin Wynn at Stormwind.
[1794.64s -> 1808.94s]  What a first act. And, uh, don't give me shit for this. World of Warcraft, not the one that they,
[1809.02s -> 1814.96s]  like, resurrected and redid it again. No, the original one back in like 2004, 2005.
[1814.96s -> 1819.65s]  That was, it was really cool. It was insane. It was unbelievable. No one had ever done that shit
[1819.65s -> 1822.45s]  before. I don't know, EverQuest, EverQuest, EverQuest. What about EverQuest? Did you play
[1822.45s -> 1833.79s]  EverQuest? I did. And I, I, this was, I liked World of Warcraft better than EverQuest. Fuck you. Why?
[1833.79s -> 1836.91s]  This is going to be hard a little bit later. I knew this was going to take a long time. Overcooked
[1836.91s -> 1840.83s]  2 should just not be on the list. It just shouldn't. It's a cool, it's a, it's a cool game. It's, it's
[1840.83s -> 1847.22s]  fun. But it's not better than, like, Resident Evil 4. It's not horrible. It just shouldn't be
[1847.22s -> 1857.28s]  on the list. Pac-Man, all right. Pac-Man might not be better than Resident Evil 4,
[1857.28s -> 1874.14s]  but it might be more important than Resident Evil 4. That doesn't matter? What do you mean
[1874.14s -> 1892.22s]  that doesn't matter? How can you compare, like, to the first, like, the first act of God of War?
[1892.22s -> 1902.75s]  But you have whole generations of technology. Of course that matters. Yes, it does. Only Dark
[1902.75s -> 1906.19s]  Souls is only at very good. That's not true. I have to get this in the, I have to get it,
[1906.75s -> 1912.19s]  all of these are within one or two tiers of correctness. I need to go and fix it,
[1912.19s -> 1923.42s]  but I need to get them up here first. Pac-Man's more important than God of War. It just is. I
[1923.42s -> 1930.26s]  could, I could look at that later. Metal Gear Rising. It was all right. It was okay. It was
[1930.26s -> 1936.54s]  fun. Metal Gear Solid 3. Is that Snake Eater? This is the best one. This is the best Metal
[1936.54s -> 1949.12s]  Gear Solid. I will die on that hill. I think this is the best Metal Gear Solid. I think it is.
[1949.12s -> 1955.38s]  Metal Gear Solid 2 was fun, but they had this, like, crazy, like, AI-generated script that you
[1955.38s -> 1967.44s]  just, they pumped it into your brain over the course of, like, 12 hours. I like Metal Gear Solid
[1967.44s -> 1977.68s]  3 the best. The first one was really good, too. That's a great series, though. Fantastic series.
[1977.68s -> 1982.24s]  Unbelievable series, but I think the third one's probably the best one. I didn't play The Last of
[1982.24s -> 1990.62s]  Us. That's a lie. I did play The Last of Us. Let me make sure I get this correct. Let me make sure
[1990.62s -> 1994.86s]  I get this correct. I might have some things missing and misremembering here. It was either
[1994.86s -> 2004.16s]  MLC Stealth or Italics. The PlayStation had a feature where you could screen share to somebody
[2004.16s -> 2009.18s]  and they could take control of the controller and play, and they did that for me with The Last of
[2009.18s -> 2020.59s]  Us for, like, 20 minutes. That's my entire time of play. It might be missing some details there,
[2020.59s -> 2034.91s]  but it was one of them. Maybe 30 minutes? Oh my. Thank God it's on the list I got. I was starting
[2034.91s -> 2043.87s]  to get a little concerned. And they've got the remake coming out. Please don't fuck that up.
[2043.87s -> 2058.16s]  Please don't fuck that up. Please. Blizzard, give us one thing. Diablo 4. Diablo 4 can suck
[2058.16s -> 2070.08s]  total ass. I don't care. Just, don't fuck with that one. Don't fuck it up. I would rather play
[2070.08s -> 2087.44s]  this than Diablo 4. Oh my God, didn't even see this. All right. What's the absolute masterpiece?
[2087.44s -> 2095.02s]  Where does it go? For a second I was like, I thought this was the Magic School Bus,
[2095.02s -> 2104.16s]  and I was like, this is a TV show. Why is it even on here? Original Counter-Strike. All right,
[2104.16s -> 2107.84s]  my enjoyment from this game was not very good because I was terrible at it and it just made
[2107.84s -> 2119.81s]  me angry. I hated Counter-Strike because I was terrible. Does the game pissed me off factor
[2119.89s -> 2128.43s]  work here? I got so sick and tired of just turning a corner and watching a guy just go like this.
[2130.18s -> 2137.28s]  And I was gone. Like, crouch dad. I didn't even know what happened. And then it's like, okay,
[2137.28s -> 2143.26s]  I guess I'm going to wait. And I don't like the waiting either. I don't like waiting around.
[2143.26s -> 2146.94s]  So somebody would just, crouch dad. And then I would just be waiting for the, for what?
[2147.50s -> 2164.90s]  No, I don't want to do it. No, I just, I don't, I didn't like it. I, I played so much Counter-Strike
[2164.90s -> 2179.20s]  and had just negative kills to deaths every game. It's definitely better than Smite. If you were
[2179.20s -> 2187.60s]  to take a screenshot right here and zoom in and put it, like, I would be an enemy of PC video
[2187.60s -> 2201.25s]  gaming. It's not accurate. I don't know if this is it. I have, I can clean it up to do it. All
[2201.25s -> 2209.95s]  right. Phantom Pain was very good. Did I pretend to like it more than I did to make sure I could
[2209.95s -> 2222.50s]  have a fifth game in my top games of 2015? That's the real question. That's the tough one.
[2222.50s -> 2231.50s]  Cause I did really like it. And by the way, I don't, I know I talked about it, but I don't
[2231.50s -> 2248.43s]  even remember giving the list. I woke up in my bed the next day. Like I remember starting that video.
[2248.43s -> 2252.11s]  It's not, no, it's, it was decent. It was, it was not better than three.
[2254.13s -> 2263.70s]  Tetris is fucking horrible. The game sucks. Only, and only, oh, listen, only smart people
[2263.70s -> 2269.95s]  put this high. Us dumb fucking idiots hate this game and think it's stupid. Yeah. You can tell
[2269.95s -> 2278.05s]  if like how smart somebody is, how high they put Tetris. Oh, Tetris man. Oh, amazing. I love Tetris.
[2278.05s -> 2281.41s]  Super. I love like the equations and no, no, no, no, no. I get this. I get, I fucking,
[2281.41s -> 2299.39s]  us idiots hate this game. I don't like Tetris. I just, it's the forward thinking and what piece
[2299.39s -> 2303.87s]  do you have next? And like, oh, get the, do the math problem. Like, oh, which can that fit there?
[2303.87s -> 2310.91s]  It's like, it's a big, no, too much, too much visual. Get it off. And there's no blood in this
[2310.91s -> 2328.61s]  game. So like, eh, eh. I fucking hate Tetris. Overwatch is not better than Smite.
[2331.98s -> 2335.18s]  Overwatch, is Overwatch, is Overwatch better than Smite?
[2335.18s -> 2361.44s]  Metal Gear Rising should not be this high. Hold on, I'll go back to it.
[2362.16s -> 2368.00s]  Was this Omega LoL? I don't play Soul Calibur. I have not played any of the Assassin's Creed
[2368.00s -> 2374.90s]  games besides the first one for guess how much time? I'll give you a hint. It's not five hours.
[2374.90s -> 2385.70s]  Call of Duty Modern Warfare? The original one. I'm one of those posers that started
[2385.70s -> 2396.69s]  playing Modern Warfare and Call of Duty at Modern Warfare 3. The original Doom. The original Doom.
[2396.69s -> 2409.33s]  Why am I saying it like that? Doom. The original Doom. This is unfair because all these old classic
[2409.33s -> 2415.34s]  video games are just automatically just placed up on this first or second row. That's kind of
[2415.34s -> 2435.39s]  unfair. Tetris. Tetris is stupid. Excuse me. Blood. Oh, what about, excuse me. Pac-Man dies
[2435.95s -> 2442.70s]  and he goes inside out and fucking disintegrates screaming. And you eat fucking people in this
[2442.70s -> 2454.86s]  game. You eat them. You crush their bones and stuff with your mouth. Arkham, I only played for like
[2454.86s -> 2464.58s]  three hours on a Steam sale. Dark Souls 3. Here comes, and here comes the never-ending debate.
[2464.58s -> 2468.58s]  Every one of the, okay, this is the worst part about doing a game list like this.
[2469.73s -> 2473.89s]  Every single Dark Souls game not only has to be right next to each other, but in the correct order.
[2473.89s -> 2481.06s]  Or I'm in trouble. You can't have this. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3,
[2481.06s -> 2485.30s]  Dark Souls, Sekiro, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, with the brackets. They have to be right,
[2485.30s -> 2496.37s]  it has to be right. No, no, no, no, you're doing it wrong. I actually, I like Dark Souls 3 a lot.
[2496.37s -> 2507.17s]  I don't know if it's first act. First act is pretty good. What was a better first act?
[2507.65s -> 2513.78s]  Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls 2 is the worst one. I think we can agree on
[2513.78s -> 2525.39s]  that one. All the Mario karts have been zero out of tens since Double Dash. Making a correct
[2525.39s -> 2535.70s]  statement here. After Double Dash, they all became zeros. What is this? Life is straight,
[2535.70s -> 2548.83s]  all right, hold on a minute here. This, I like, this was, I liked this. Better than Tetris?
[2548.83s -> 2570.59s]  Is Life is Strange better than Overwatch? Life is Strange is better than, I know you, but you
[2570.59s -> 2582.86s]  can't say, oh, what, Life is Strange is better than Tetris? I cringe. I don't like Tetris.
[2582.86s -> 2591.28s]  I don't like Tetris. I think the game sucks. I didn't like Tetris when I was 12. I was like
[2591.28s -> 2595.60s]  nine years old playing it, eight years old on the Nintendo or something, on my Game Boy.
[2595.60s -> 2599.76s]  And I remember just being like, this game's fucking stu-, I didn't swear. But I was like,
[2599.76s -> 2607.06s]  I hate this. I don't like this game. Where's Bonk? By the way, if Bonk was on here,
[2607.06s -> 2621.04s]  he'd be up in fucking Masterpiece. Bonk is the best Game Boy game. And who talks about that?
[2621.04s -> 2631.54s]  Nobody but me. Final Fantasy VII. The only experience I have with Final Fantasy VII was
[2631.54s -> 2636.90s]  watching Burger Boy scream at his TV, jumping up and down, because he couldn't beat the last boss
[2636.90s -> 2650.64s]  over and over again. And this is like, like 19 years ago. And I think he got so mad. I remember
[2650.64s -> 2656.56s]  like, he got to the point where he was so mad moving around that he could unplug the controller.
[2657.12s -> 2662.35s]  And that made him even more mad. And he was jumping up and down, like jumping up and down,
[2662.35s -> 2667.22s]  controllers out of the port. So I'm, and that was my reasoning for never playing this.
[2667.78s -> 2674.99s]  I've never played Final Fantasy VII. I've just seen the final boss and an angry friend. So I was
[2674.99s -> 2689.18s]  like, well, fuck this game. Why would I play this? It's my only experience. But a great soundtrack.
[2689.18s -> 2695.81s]  And I've, I've seen the movies and they're good. The movies were pretty cool. I never, yeah,
[2695.81s -> 2704.18s]  I know. I'm the person that didn't, I didn't, I watched the movies. No, they're not good.
[2704.18s -> 2712.58s]  They literally aren't. The movies aren't good. Advent Children. Yeah, that's the one I saw. That
[2712.58s -> 2725.58s]  was bad. Advent Children, Omega, lol. He doesn't know. Well, I didn't understand anything that was
[2725.58s -> 2737.84s]  going on, but I like, I like Katsith and I like, I think it's cool. But wait, but Katsith, those are
[2737.84s -> 2745.76s]  terrible. The only reason why I wanted to play, I must have Metal Gear Solid VII, which was wrong,
[2747.17s -> 2753.57s]  is because Katsith has dice and don't you like gamble to play? Don't you, he like throws dice
[2753.57s -> 2761.39s]  into like it could be anything, right? That's cool. That's cool. I like that character. What
[2761.39s -> 2766.85s]  am I talking about? We're talking about Final Fantasy VII. What is he saying? What? Let him
[2766.85s -> 2772.48s]  enjoy something. What? Katsith was on screen for five seconds total in Advent Children. Yeah. And
[2772.48s -> 2779.98s]  that's the part where I stood up in the fucking theater and I screamed and clapping. And me and
[2779.98s -> 2786.05s]  one other person that thought Katsith was cool. And I pointed at them and I was like, you get it?
[2786.05s -> 2797.33s]  You and I get it. Ow, my elbow. And then he was like, holy shit, are you okay? And he ran over and
[2797.33s -> 2806.38s]  he like held my elbow and he like wrapped it up. And I was like, and then that's how I met
[2806.38s -> 2815.14s]  Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy. Anyways, Inside was good. No, no, get this off of really bad.
[2815.14s -> 2841.50s]  I don't like the word bad for these. I have no, I don't play video games. Pokemon Emerald version.
[2841.50s -> 2856.13s]  I've never, I don't play it. Oh my God. The only experience I have in Super Metroid
[2857.01s -> 2868.48s]  was renting it from Blockbuster and somebody else's save file being there, right? And then opening it
[2869.04s -> 2869.84s]  and just hearing the
[2869.84s -> 2877.44s]  thing. And running around and shooting stuff. And I had no idea where the fuck I was going
[2878.16s -> 2882.64s]  because the map is all over the place. And you had to have known what you did before to do what
[2882.64s -> 2886.72s]  you're doing in the future. And I didn't want to start at the beginning. I did that for a lot of
[2886.72s -> 2893.01s]  games, by the way. How many of you guys rented games like RPGs, especially turn-based RPGs?
[2893.01s -> 2898.90s]  I did this all the time with Earthbound. I think I was too stupid to like really want to play
[2898.90s -> 2903.92s]  from the beginning. So I would just hope that there would be a save file that was more than
[2903.92s -> 2907.44s]  halfway through the game. And I'd be like, oh, nice. They're like halfway through the game.
[2907.44s -> 2914.42s]  And I would just walk around and fight stuff and just play on somebody else's save that they had
[2914.42s -> 2920.50s]  on the Blockbuster one and just enjoy maybe like 30 minutes. And then I would just stop. I just
[2920.50s -> 2928.05s]  wanted to enjoy somebody else's time in the game. Like I didn't want to start at the beginning.
[2928.05s -> 2937.17s]  You're a fraud exposed. That's weird. Earthbound street. I don't know. It was definitely because
[2937.49s -> 2945.49s]  I didn't get it. Especially turn-based RPGs. They were like too slow for me. They would be like,
[2945.49s -> 2948.77s]  wait, what do I have to do? I have to get the stick and equip the stick and then like walk
[2948.77s -> 2953.81s]  over to here to the town and buy this and then walk over here and fight. No, this is back when
[2955.04s -> 2962.21s]  pressing A as fast as I could was my skill, my skill set. So pressing A as fast as I could was
[2962.21s -> 2966.54s]  like a half of every Super Nintendo game. And if that wasn't in a Super Nintendo game, then I might
[2966.54s -> 2973.50s]  as well head back to sort of return to the Blockbuster. Papers, please was very good.
[2973.50s -> 2980.86s]  But again, I would always start Papers, please and get to the point when there was more than
[2980.86s -> 2985.34s]  three or four things you had to do. And that's where I would stop because I couldn't do it.
[2985.34s -> 2989.90s]  It'd be like, okay, you have to check the ID. I got to check their work order, where they work
[2989.90s -> 2998.46s]  and their passport. And this is too much. I don't want to do it anymore. The game is incredible
[2998.46s -> 3004.48s]  until you get to like the four things on the screen. It's very good though. It's up here
[3004.56s -> 3020.83s]  somewhere. Outlast 1, I actually really liked. But you can't put Outlast in front of Doom,
[3020.83s -> 3026.93s]  can you? We'll see. We'll see. I'll fix it later. Hold on. Is it going to get in the right place?
[3027.94s -> 3033.22s]  Persona. I've never played Persona. All I know is that I saw someone, I watched somebody play
[3033.22s -> 3036.98s]  Persona 3 for like 10 minutes. And it was a part where they were like just shooting themselves in
[3036.98s -> 3044.05s]  the head with guns. And I was like, oh, okay. Like that's how you fight. It was like, wow,
[3044.05s -> 3058.30s]  that's crazy. Sekiro was better than Dark Souls 2, but was lower on the list for Dark Souls games
[3058.30s -> 3065.79s]  for me. And no, it's not Dark Souls. I know. I know. I know. I didn't play Yakuza 4. I've
[3065.79s -> 3073.97s]  never played a Fire Emblem game. GTA 4 probably deserves to go in front of GTA 5 because
[3074.96s -> 3081.20s]  technologically speaking, when GTA 4 came out, it was insane and never done before. And by the time
[3081.20s -> 3088.67s]  GTA 5 came out, open world games having that much going on was pretty normal. So they kind of
[3088.67s -> 3095.50s]  started that. They did that really first. So I think it belongs in front of it. Even though
[3095.50s -> 3105.34s]  the video game might be a little bit worse than GTA 5, like the engine of the video game. I like
[3105.34s -> 3110.77s]  GTA 4. It was more, it was kind of crunchy, you know what I mean? It was like crusty in a way.
[3110.77s -> 3118.96s]  I liked it. It's like Breath of the Wild if you like open world. I will one day. Apex Legends
[3118.96s -> 3133.02s]  have never played it. Wait, the first Walking Dead Telltale game. I almost just like spoiled
[3133.02s -> 3150.45s]  everything. The Walking Dead Telltale game had a few really, really fantastic moments.
[3150.45s -> 3157.30s]  There was a few, and they were not short. They were, it led up to a lot of, there was a couple
[3157.30s -> 3164.64s]  things in particular. I was like, oh, that was, it was really cool. I don't think it was like,
[3164.64s -> 3175.50s]  whoa, amazing. It's the best game ever. It was good. I liked it. It belongs in the good to very
[3175.50s -> 3186.72s]  good. Was it better than Doom? Well, I have to fix that. Red? Oh, Devil May Cry. No, I haven't
[3186.72s -> 3192.70s]  played it. None of them. I have no time in any Devil May Cry. Yakuza Zero, I've played for like,
[3192.70s -> 3202.82s]  oh, I know, but I can't rate this because it's better than Tetris. It's better than Life is
[3202.82s -> 3209.09s]  Strange. It's better than Metal Gear Rising. Overwatch is worse. Overwatch is way worse.
[3209.09s -> 3214.99s]  No, it's not. It's better. Modern Warfare should not be over here. Modern Warfare should be,
[3214.99s -> 3234.58s]  actually be down here. Like, let's be honest. I'm just thinking, if Until Dawn is down here,
[3234.58s -> 3255.68s]  does Life is Strange deserve to be up here? I don't think Until Dawn was horrible. I don't,
[3255.68s -> 3259.28s]  honestly, I, this is cut off at the top. I don't even know what Far Cry it is, but it doesn't
[3259.28s -> 3264.46s]  fucking matter because every single one of them is the same game. I have no idea which one this is,
[3264.46s -> 3277.95s]  but all of them go down here. Is it three, four, five? I don't know which one it is.
[3277.95s -> 3286.50s]  Okay, Portal 2 and Portal. I'm gonna make a lot of people upset with this. I know,
[3286.50s -> 3296.72s]  first of all, there's a method to this. Hold on. Portal 2 was awesome. Portal 1 made me almost
[3296.72s -> 3303.50s]  throw up every time I played it. Portal 2 was spread out enough with different stuff in between
[3304.46s -> 3312.14s]  that I could get over how much I wanted to throw up. Portal 1 was just puke, puke, puke, puke,
[3312.14s -> 3317.12s]  puke. Just throw up puke, puke, puke. It was just puzzle puke, puzzle puke, puzzle puke.
[3317.12s -> 3325.31s]  It made me sick. The game Portal actually makes me ill, even in Portal 2. Portal 2 was more going
[3325.31s -> 3329.39s]  on. It wasn't just like go in this room and do a puzzle and then lie down on the ground,
[3329.39s -> 3336.18s]  which I did many times. I would complete a level in Portal 2 and be green and then I would lie
[3336.18s -> 3346.75s]  on the ground in where my computer was. I would lie on the ground and just wait till it passed
[3346.75s -> 3353.86s]  and then I would get up and do the next level. I couldn't handle it. That didn't happen in Portal
[3353.86s -> 3362.38s]  2. This would be up way higher if it wasn't the way. I do think Portal 2 was better than Half-Life
[3362.38s -> 3370.72s]  1 just because it's, I don't know, it was newer. I liked Cave Johnson. Life gives you lemons. Get
[3370.72s -> 3382.22s]  some limes and half a sprite or whatever. He's had funny lines. Yeah, it belongs up here. Maybe
[3382.22s -> 3414.48s]  even a little higher. Put God of War down here. You just ruined my night. No, I'm just kidding.
[3414.48s -> 3421.57s]  Somebody, can I do this? I don't know why. I want to like make two cams. Have one of them be blue
[3421.57s -> 3425.65s]  and the other one be red and put them right next to each other transparent and like give you like
[3425.65s -> 3473.10s]  a 3D show. Can I do that? Color corrector. I need blue. Where's blue? Wait, color.
[3488.77s -> 3511.06s]  All right, that's red. Let me turn the brightness up. Is it gonna work? Okay, so there's that one
[3519.17s -> 3543.95s]  and then I need blue. I'm gonna, this is gonna be 3D. Oh, I can't, why can't I duplicate it?
[3543.95s -> 3550.77s]  No, I want to, I want to duplicate this and make it blue. Why can't I do that?
[3550.77s -> 3563.66s]  Paste duplicate. Why not? Is this a virtual boy? I don't think I can do a dupli- yeah,
[3563.66s -> 3570.42s]  I had this problem before. Yeah, because I can only paste a reference. I can't paste a duplicate.
[3571.38s -> 3588.85s]  Why? That's really annoying. Let's do a virtual boy. Yeah, I can't. Why can't I paste a duplicate?
[3588.85s -> 3599.39s]  Does anyone know how to do this? Because I haven't been, I've been trying to do this for years.
[3600.03s -> 3606.05s]  Can I just add another source, which is this camera or is that not going to work?
[3606.77s -> 3694.96s]  OBS can only take one camera. Like, hell it can. I'll be right back. Sorry, sorry, hold on,
[3694.96s -> 3728.72s]  hold on. This is so fucked up. I broke it because I plugged a camera in. Hold on. You see? All right,
[3728.72s -> 3733.58s]  this one works. All right, all right, all right, all right, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[3733.58s -> 3754.98s]  I got it. I should have it. This is gonna be fucked up. I can't wait. All right, now I'm almost done.
[3754.98s -> 3794.38s]  You see? Here we go. They gotta be in the same spot. This one's, this one's focus is fucked up.
[3794.38s -> 3807.49s]  Is it like grease on here? There was grease on it. There was a layer of grease. Oh, that's
[3807.49s -> 3834.58s]  disgusting. Okay, here we go. This one has to be blue. Did it work? I'm coming at you in 3D.
[3835.38s -> 3848.35s]  Okay, hold on. By the way, I gotta make this, I gotta, I gotta say this real quick. This is
[3848.35s -> 3852.45s]  probably, which camera do I look at? This is probably gonna hurt your eyes. This is probably
[3852.45s -> 3857.81s]  not gonna be, this is probably gonna suck to look at. So, I just want to make that really clear
[3857.81s -> 3861.25s]  right now. Like, just if you have like sensitivity, this is actually probably gonna be horrible.
[3861.25s -> 3868.34s]  Okay, so, make this, like you do it a little bit off to the side, right? I gotta make these
[3868.34s -> 3908.59s]  close to each other. Can I get it? Hold on. Red needs to be brighter. I'm gonna, I'm gonna like
[3908.59s -> 3923.20s]  throw popcorn in your face. Okay, brighter. Better? All right, here we go. It's time for your 3D.
[3923.20s -> 3964.48s]  You ready? I'm coming at you. I'm coming at you. They're off sync? Does that matter? Coming at you
[3964.48s -> 3971.86s]  live in 3D. Yeah, this is just, okay, when, you know when you go to the movies and you go to the
[3971.86s -> 3978.82s]  3D movie, and you realize that like halfway through the fucking movie, you really don't want
[3978.82s -> 3985.70s]  to watch it in 3D anymore, and you take the glasses off and you're just like, oh, Batman's
[3985.70s -> 3994.75s]  like punching the guy, and it's just like, and you're just like, I don't, can I, can we just go to
[3994.75s -> 4011.94s]  the other movie? This movie's fucking three hours long of this. Hold on, wait, ready? Just hit my
[4011.94s -> 4017.14s]  fucking monitor. I'm fine. It's not a heel. Hold on, wait, wait, wait. I need to.
[4038.80s -> 4058.34s]  All right, now we'll get your 3D glasses on eventually and watch that. I think, I actually
[4058.34s -> 4071.63s]  think it's probably gonna work. Okay, I'm fine. I think it's gonna work. All right, back to what
[4071.71s -> 4087.87s]  we were doing. I was doing this. Let's go. So, hmm, more how? I mean, look at how many are still on
[4087.87s -> 4099.63s]  here. Well, this is the last thing we're doing, except something else. There's something else to
[4099.63s -> 4113.68s]  show you. In fact, why don't we go over this now? I have something to show you. I came across
[4113.68s -> 4124.45s]  something very interesting. You know, turn this off for a sec. So, in my hand here, I've got,
[4124.45s -> 4135.42s]  I've got a little thing. Now, it's not Catboy. I saw my uncle recently, and at a little family
[4135.42s -> 4144.93s]  thing, and he was shit-faced, and he told me that he had something, a family heirloom, that was very
[4144.93s -> 4153.44s]  important. I had no idea what he was talking about. I thought, it's not a carrot. It's not a carrot.
[4153.44s -> 4162.66s]  It's some kind of important document. So, he told me that it was probably worth a lot of money.
[4162.66s -> 4168.93s]  It was grandpa's secret. So, the curiosity got ahold of me, and I said, well,
[4170.21s -> 4175.71s]  can I see it? He said, no. He said, you can't. It's just fucking safer. Remember, he was shit-faced.
[4175.71s -> 4181.74s]  So, I said, listen, I'll trade you a trip to McDonald's. I'll take you to the drive-through.
[4181.74s -> 4189.95s]  And he thought about it for a second, and he agreed. So, I got, I got whatever this is,
[4191.26s -> 4203.81s]  grandpa's secret, and we're going to open it right now. Are you ready? All it took was a
[4203.81s -> 4228.62s]  trip to McDonald's. What have we got here? This is a map. A map to what? Well, I mean,
[4228.62s -> 4233.92s]  that's obviously Las Vegas in the background. There's a treasure chest in the middle.
[4238.14s -> 4248.69s]  What is it? Is it a teaser trailer? Teaser is a bit, I mean, there's no information on here.
[4250.72s -> 4259.97s]  This is supposed to be Las Vegas. Vegas is landlocked. I, grandpa, I, there's no,
[4259.97s -> 4270.64s]  there ain't no water in Vegas. I don't think that's accurate. Anyhow, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
[4270.64s -> 4274.62s]  get some experts involved, and I'm gonna see if I can figure out what the fuck this is,
[4274.62s -> 4284.88s]  because there's very obviously something here. I see, first of all, I see a hamburger up here.
[4291.12s -> 4299.84s]  I think I'm, I'm gonna look into this. I'm gonna, I'm gonna look into that. Oh, I, hey, hey,
[4299.84s -> 4306.10s]  drunk Uncle Frank, you may have made the biggest mistake of your life, because I'm gonna get
[4306.10s -> 4320.59s]  whatever the fuck that is. Forgot about the wink. Why are you so red? All because of this. I'm
[4320.59s -> 4332.45s]  wearing like two, three layers. Porn acting. I've been that guy for a fucking year.
[4334.50s -> 4352.67s]  I felt, whoa, hold on, let's redo it. A treasure! I just like fucked up my neck.
[4352.67s -> 4367.54s]  I just pogged too much, and I just put a kink in my neck. Oh, holy shit, that fucking hurts.
[4369.44s -> 4382.27s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. It hurts. All right, we're good. Oh, we're gonna figure out
[4382.27s -> 4390.61s]  what this means. Very, very, very soon. I'm gonna go do some exploring. I need to find out what that
[4390.61s -> 4410.74s]  is. What's your porn acting? Fucking neck hurts. That was a YouTuber acting? Oh, what did I do?
[4413.54s -> 4418.10s]  What did I do to myself? I pogged so hard that I just like, it was like,
[4418.98s -> 4431.38s]  I gotta take a bath. That's the hardest I've ever pogged. On camera, for sure. All right, let's,
[4431.38s -> 4438.46s]  let's go. You know, you know, you know, I'm thinking, you know what I'm thinking?
[4438.46s -> 4443.90s]  You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking a good, I'm thinking, I'm thinking Saturday afternoon
[4443.90s -> 4457.50s]  sounds like a really good time to go maybe look for this. That's what I'm thinking. And if I were
[4457.50s -> 4465.66s]  to give a time on Saturday that I would be doing that and exploring and trying to find grandpa's
[4465.66s -> 4471.49s]  secret, whatever it is. Gosh, I would probably put the sus at 1 p.m pacific on Saturday,
[4473.71s -> 4504.34s]  this Saturday, what I would do. What is it, nobody cares? All right, Mario 2. I always put Mario 2
[4504.34s -> 4516.77s]  in really bad. This two, all right, there are too many games on this list. There are way too many
[4516.77s -> 4525.60s]  games on this list. I can't do this. Dead Rising 2 was awesome, but was it better than Dead Rising 1?
[4526.24s -> 4534.35s]  Although I complained every single time I played it. I didn't play Deus Ex. I, where was, I played
[4534.35s -> 4548.88s]  Bully. I don't remember how good Bully was. I remember being, I remember it was good. I think
[4548.88s -> 4556.64s]  it belongs up here. Super Mario Galaxy 2, I didn't even play one second of it. Shadow of War
[4557.28s -> 4565.02s]  belongs up here, somewhere in good. I'll fix it. Crash Bandicoot, I never played it. None of them,
[4565.02s -> 4568.94s]  all three of them. I didn't, I just saw the demos at like the GameStop. I remember watching people
[4568.94s -> 4575.23s]  play them. The one that's like two minutes long. Only the PlayStation disc, I never played them.
[4575.23s -> 4586.03s]  Mario Galaxy, this is really good. That goes up in amazing. It's very, very good. Probably the
[4586.03s -> 4594.24s]  best Mario game that I've played in probably the last 10 to 15 years. I didn't play Factorio.
[4594.24s -> 4600.80s]  Is this Superman? I don't know what it is. What is that? Is this one of the, I don't think,
[4600.80s -> 4604.90s]  I don't think I played that Monster Hunter. I didn't play the Indiana Jones one. I didn't,
[4604.90s -> 4612.19s]  I played Lego Star Wars. I mean, it was all right. It was decent. Yeah, but it was not,
[4612.19s -> 4620.93s]  probably not better than Portal, though. Maybe. I've never played Roblox. I played this. This is
[4620.93s -> 4631.04s]  the Super Nintendo Zelda, right? That belongs up in great. Can we just, can these be free spaces?
[4631.04s -> 4641.97s]  Is this Ocarina of Time? Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. These have to be free spaces, like Bingo.
[4641.97s -> 4647.28s]  You can't, listen, you can't put on the greatest video games of all time list,
[4648.08s -> 4656.67s]  Zelda under good. These are free spaces. Zelda, Pac-Man, and Doom are free spaces up in amazing.
[4656.75s -> 4671.07s]  Yes, you can. It sucks. It does not suck. Resident Evil 7. The first act was amazing. The rest of
[4671.07s -> 4682.38s]  the game was not very good. I'm going to put it down here. Terraria. I, I just don't, I'm not,
[4682.38s -> 4686.78s]  I just don't, I just not a big fan of Terraria. It was, I played it. I beat the game. Me and
[4686.78s -> 4694.59s]  Ster played it. I, it was all right. It was, I don't really like, I, I, listen, how do I word
[4694.59s -> 4700.14s]  this without having like a rock go through the window right now? I like Terraria. I think it's
[4700.14s -> 4704.78s]  a really cool game. I just don't like the way it plays. I just don't like the side scrolling like,
[4707.73s -> 4727.74s]  it's fun. Let's get myself watering eyes from that. Play what? I'm going to sneeze. Am I? It's
[4727.74s -> 4738.38s]  coming. Rocket League. No, I never play, I don't play it. Skyrim. I played for four hours. Three
[4738.38s -> 4745.09s]  and a half hours were making monsters. So no. The Witcher 3. I never played it. Celeste was very,
[4745.09s -> 4752.70s]  listen to my voice. What's going on? Celeste was very good. Would I put Celeste somewhere over here?
[4752.70s -> 4779.65s]  Where do I put it? I didn't even play Doom 2016. I did for like three hours. Why is it even up here?
[4779.65s -> 4795.90s]  Where do I put the games that I've only played for four hours? Where do I put them? I can't say,
[4795.90s -> 4803.87s]  oh wow, it's like, it's one of the best games ever when you play it for three hours. It's going down
[4803.87s -> 4816.74s]  here. Make a new tier and call it four hour Andy. Okay. Let's make a new tier. Add a row below.
[4816.74s -> 4835.44s]  Okay. Four. There you go. And that, it can be just like, I don't know, grayed out. A lot of games
[4835.44s -> 4854.35s]  are going up here. Oh my god. So many games are going to be on here. What actually? No, I haven't
[4854.35s -> 4873.74s]  played Fortnite for more than 10 minutes. This is so bad. What else have I played for the four hours?
[4875.65s -> 4882.64s]  No. No. Batman. Modern Warfare, the original. Maybe because I downloaded it one day because
[4882.64s -> 4890.82s]  I wanted to try it. That's good. What about up here? Battlefield 1 is a four hour Andy.
[4890.82s -> 4902.05s]  Mario Kart 8. I, I, I'm not going to put it for our last of us. Watch Dogs, Watch Dogs 2. I want to
[4902.05s -> 4918.67s]  go, I want to go to bed so bad. Four hour fart. I've seen a lot of trans pride and I gotta make
[4918.67s -> 4932.35s]  something really clear. Please, for the love of God, I support LGBT rights. Full stop. That's a
[4932.35s -> 4941.02s]  full stop. And sometimes you look over and you see people very, very upset about that.
[4942.86s -> 4950.53s]  And I just gotta say, I gotta make it clear again, I don't want to see any, like, awful
[4950.53s -> 4956.21s]  shit. And we've seen, I'm gonna be honest with you, I've seen some really awful shit in this chat
[4956.21s -> 4964.40s]  about that. And there's the idea that, what about the spam? Spam is always taken care of. We have
[4964.40s -> 4975.76s]  a rule for spam. So there's no reason, there's no reason at all to, if you see the trans pride
[4975.76s -> 4983.82s]  emote, to automatically start to just throw awful shit into this chat. Spam will be taken care of.
[4983.82s -> 4990.67s]  Please, for the love of God, don't be such an asshole. Because I hate to say it, I really do.
[4990.67s -> 5000.91s]  I've seen stuff in this chat that I'm not, does not make me happy. So let me make that really clear.
[5000.91s -> 5018.37s]  I, I have to. Because, what about, thank you. Well, it's, I'll be honest, it's, it's hard to
[5018.37s -> 5024.67s]  talk about on stream. Because for some reason there is a percentage of people that just really,
[5024.67s -> 5031.26s]  really hate the fact that it's talked about. And I gotta make that really clear that I,
[5032.35s -> 5038.83s]  wherever you stand socially, politically, it doesn't matter. I don't bring that shit here.
[5038.83s -> 5044.45s]  Don't bring that negative shit here. I don't want to see it. And if I do, I'm gonna be,
[5044.45s -> 5056.34s]  it's gonna be taken care of. It just is. You don't have to explain yourself. Well, sometimes you do.
[5056.34s -> 5072.22s]  Sometimes I do. There you go. That's, I want to make that clear. Get back to the, get back to this.
[5072.22s -> 5090.82s]  Yeah, we will. It was a good transition from the fart joke. Is that, is that how,
[5090.82s -> 5102.45s]  that's not what happened? That's not what happened. Yes, it is. No, it's not. What fart joke?
[5102.45s -> 5118.51s]  I didn't make a fart joke. Or our fart. Oh, I did say that right before. Whatever. It doesn't
[5118.51s -> 5127.60s]  matter. I, doesn't, all right, let's, let's fucking go. You're the master of the segue.
[5128.66s -> 5134.85s]  It's so fucking hot in here. Like, and I, I just so badly want you to know what website I'm on.
[5135.41s -> 5141.46s]  You're here right now. I don't have to fucking wear this. You, I, why do I have to wear this
[5141.46s -> 5156.19s]  right now? Let's show the Andy Mark t-shirt. It's too, I don't know why. Like, hey, I'm on
[5156.19s -> 5164.14s]  Twitch.tv. You see this shirt? Like, this isn't a doc. I don't have to wear like the lab coat.
[5164.14s -> 5176.88s]  It's not a doctor's office. Like, oh, I'm a doctor, you know. Twerk, please. Okay. That is so sweaty
[5176.88s -> 5188.80s]  and disgusting. I can't even tell you. Twerk. And now, hey, I'm almost as like red as the t-shirt.
[5188.80s -> 5192.74s]  It is so fucking hot in here. Why is it so hot in here? All right, let's go.
[5194.13s -> 5201.82s]  Lego Star Wars 2. I have, I have no idea. Uh, did I, I played Limbo on stream, didn't I?
[5201.82s -> 5213.54s]  It was for four hours. That's four hour Andy. That counts. Did I beat it on stream?
[5213.54s -> 5223.31s]  Wait, it's a four hour game. Oh, okay. It was, it was all right. I liked it. Monster Hunter World?
[5223.31s -> 5228.51s]  Uh, I remember streaming Monster Hunter World with italics and getting so angry at the game
[5228.51s -> 5233.65s]  that I never played it again. So I'm going to say four hour Andy. That's a lie. I beat the whole
[5233.65s -> 5249.54s]  thing with italics off stream. I thought it was all right. No More Heroes is a good game,
[5250.10s -> 5256.70s]  but a terrible video game. It's in, it's somewhere in here. Uncharted, never played them.
[5256.70s -> 5262.06s]  Chrono Trigger, thank you very much. We're going up all the way to Masterpiece. Thank you very much.
[5262.06s -> 5277.02s]  Chrono Trigger's a masterpiece. It is. Uh, I never played this. I didn't play any of the Pokemon's
[5277.58s -> 5284.70s]  Jackbox Party Pack 6. That, that shouldn't be on here. Why is Jackbox Party Pack 6 on here?
[5285.34s -> 5299.78s]  Jackbox Party Pack 6? Hearthstone is on here? No, it's not. Oh my God, it is. This is decent.
[5299.78s -> 5310.88s]  Firewatch, I, all right, it was decent. It was all right. Beat Saber, I don't, four hour Andy.
[5310.88s -> 5316.85s]  Silent Hill 2, four hour Andy. I only played it for like four hours. The Sims 4, four hour Andy.
[5316.85s -> 5334.24s]  Getting over it, four hours. Half-Life 2 was, show the photos. Go watch the video. Half-Life 2
[5334.24s -> 5345.52s]  is not a masterpiece for me. It's not. There's a lot of subs. I missed all these. Uh, Mega Cheese
[5345.52s -> 5354.19s]  Nips, thanks to the five subs. James Morris, five subs. Volco, five. Ten from Lenny the Person.

[5382.93s -> 5393.17s]  8-Bit 15, Matt Reyes 5. Oh, actually, it's Matt Australia. This is still coming in. Justfin 5,
[5393.17s -> 5405.25s]  Julie the Fooly 5, and then Gearbroth 5, and then another five from JWY. Oh, okay, we're going.
[5405.25s -> 5410.27s]  Vinsmoke 5. These just kind of come out of nowhere. I'll just look over here and it's just like
[5410.27s -> 5416.77s]  bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, sub, sub, sub, sub, subs. You guys just load in.
[5416.77s -> 5421.20s]  Uh, thank you, all of you, though. Seriously, thank you. Uh, Jamie, thanks for the five.

[5503.25s -> 5509.20s]  the Hype Train. I look like, like, I have like fucking skeleton skin. What's with this white
[5509.20s -> 5524.27s]  balance? I don't like it. I look weird. Hey, Ballistic Burrito, five. Robotic Rogue, five.

[5557.34s -> 5564.67s]  I really appreciate it. But we don't have to do this. All right. That's it. That's it. No more.
[5565.92s -> 5572.42s]  Yeah, you get just too much money. Thank you. I will take it, but it's a lot.

[5624.66s -> 5636.56s]  He doesn't care? No, of course I do. It's just a lot. No, I, of course I do. Um, Miss, hold on.
[5636.56s -> 5645.58s]  More coming in. Five from Marshmallowy Ghost. Phi from David Cage Official Twitch. Something
[5645.58s -> 5650.96s]  telling me that's not David Cage's official Twitch. Emperor Zant, Mindizel, Little Pretzel,
[5650.96s -> 5657.20s]  Bugwiki, and AB Joe. Thank you Bugwiki for ten. This is a money stream now. This is just a collect
[5657.20s -> 5667.34s]  money on camera stream. I'm just sitting here collecting money while I just sit here and talk.
[5667.34s -> 5674.90s]  Thank you Gaw for the five. Spicy Pepe's for the five. Ten from Nocturnal Turn. Wild Card
[5674.90s -> 5678.74s]  Soldier, five. This is almost, it's almost a thousand subs by the way. I don't even know
[5678.74s -> 5684.66s]  what to do. How do I turn the faucet off? How do I distract you guys? I think I know what to do.
[5686.34s -> 5717.68s]  I think I know how to distract you guys. Quick, refund, refund, refund. Uh, 808 thanks for the
[5717.68s -> 5726.18s]  five. Uncle Joe, five. Fourbugs, five. VGB, five. Feline, five. Evasive Milk, five. Somewhat Bleak,

[5746.75s -> 5752.99s]  All right, I'm going to continue with the tier list. From here on out, any community subs are
[5752.99s -> 5761.46s]  going to be appreciated, but I gotta move on. I gotta stream. This is insane. This is over a
[5761.46s -> 5771.04s]  thousand gifted subs. Thank you everybody. This is unbelievable amount of subscriptions.
[5771.04s -> 5780.70s]  And it's over a thousand community subs. That's fucking crazy. Uh, I hopefully, hopefully I can
[5780.70s -> 5788.26s]  put Warcraft 3 in the right spot, otherwise I'm gonna lose subs. Uh, thank you guys, really.
[5788.26s -> 5794.86s]  Completely unnecessary. Thank you nonetheless. Hopefully I do good. Hopefully I can use your
[5794.86s -> 5806.90s]  money wisely. Thank you. Among Us Andy. I'm the person up for ten seconds, because then they'll
[5806.90s -> 5815.12s]  have a full tech of ten seconds to really go over what they did wrong. Uh, Warcraft 3 was amazing.
[5815.68s -> 5821.06s]  It belongs up here. It does. Not the remake, the original one. I think it deserves to be up there.
[5821.06s -> 5829.39s]  Battlefront 2, never played it. Street Fighter 2, I've really, I've watched people at the arcade
[5829.39s -> 5833.97s]  play it, but I never, I never played it. Second Son, never played it. The Spider-Man game, that
[5833.97s -> 5844.05s]  should be up here under, under good. That's under good. Path of Exile, this is a four hour Andy.
[5844.05s -> 5849.26s]  Uh, Dishonored, that's a four hour Andy. Yakuza didn't play this one. Need for Speed didn't play
[5849.26s -> 5855.26s]  this one. Assassin's Creed didn't play it. Didn't play the Dragon Ball game. Minecraft. Do I put
[5855.26s -> 5864.86s]  Minecraft in, um, I don't think I put Minecraft in Masterpiece. I think it goes under great. High
[5864.86s -> 5873.60s]  rate. Doom 2016 is not, seriously, why is it even up here? It belongs down here. Spider-Man
[5873.60s -> 5879.42s]  belongs probably up here under very good. I really liked that Spider-Man game, it was really good.
[5879.42s -> 5886.77s]  Spec Ops The Line, I didn't play it. Crusader, I didn't play Crusader's Kings 2. I don't know
[5886.77s -> 5903.14s]  what that is. Um, Gmail? What is that? Oh, that's Gar, that's Garry's Mod. That's Garry's Mod. Is
[5903.14s -> 5918.62s]  Garry's Mod really like a masterpiece of a video game, or is it like a cool toolbox? It's good,
[5918.62s -> 5925.23s]  but I don't know, it doesn't belong high that up there. Hi. Uh, Superhot. The original Superhot
[5925.23s -> 5931.81s]  was cool. Superhot VR was better. It's not on here, which is disappointing. Mordhau's not really bad.
[5931.81s -> 5940.85s]  It was, it was good. It was, it wasn't better than Portal. Civilization. Didn't play any of the
[5940.85s -> 5953.41s]  Civilizations. Spore. Uh, Spore's gonna go up to good. Fallout 4, that's four hour Andy. Maybe six
[5953.41s -> 5966.94s]  hour Andy. What just went in my eye? Super Seducer on greatest games of all time? Why? I never played
[5966.94s -> 5972.34s]  it, but why? Uh, this is another Far Cry, who knows what it is. It could be one I played, I don't
[5972.34s -> 5979.39s]  care, it just belongs down here. I may as well have never played it. Uh, Far Cry 5 is four hour Andy.
[5979.39s -> 5990.83s]  Guitar Hero, is this a mobile game? It's like a Facebook game. Hotline Miami. This goes up to good.
[5990.83s -> 6000.38s]  Actually, very good. No, it's, I'm gonna keep it at good. That is a mo-, it's a Facebook game.
[6000.38s -> 6010.77s]  Fallout 76. I don't, why would I ever play this? Is this Pong? Pong is definitely four hour Andy.
[6010.77s -> 6020.83s]  I have probably played it three times. Yeah, absolutely. I didn't play Deus Ex. Didn't play
[6020.83s -> 6028.26s]  Dishonored 2. I played For Honor, that's also for four hours. Metro 2033, I played the whole thing,
[6028.26s -> 6034.70s]  and I did like it, but I don't think it was that great. No, I'm thinking of the next one. I liked
[6034.70s -> 6046.08s]  2033. Actually, I actually really liked 2033, it was great. Deus Ex. Yeah, I didn't play it.
[6046.08s -> 6053.76s]  This is Persona, I've never played it, didn't play it. What? No, yeah, I did. Back in like 2013 or
[6053.76s -> 6070.19s]  something. Wii Sports? Um, it was good. I don't even know what that is. Guitar Hero 3 is four hour
[6070.19s -> 6077.38s]  Andy. I may have like in college or something played it once, twice maybe. I played Rock Band,
[6077.38s -> 6085.89s]  I played Rock Band a lot. Not Guitar Hero 3. Stalker, I streamed it for four hours. Ooh,
[6085.89s -> 6095.73s]  Cuphead. Cuphead belongs up here. Probably up at very good. When's a DLC come up for Cuphead?
[6105.14s -> 6117.95s]  Never. Oh no, what? It wasn't bad news or anything, was there? Postal 3 on greatest
[6117.95s -> 6130.54s]  games ever, four hour Andy. Sniper Elite 3, four hour Andy. Undertale, uh oh. See, some of you took
[6130.54s -> 6134.78s]  a screenshot when I was doing this. Like when I was moving this up and scrolling. Screenshot!
[6134.78s -> 6137.74s]  So you can like link it to somebody that you know loves that game and now they hate me.
[6138.38s -> 6150.51s]  It's up here somewhere. Shadow, that's way too high. Shadow the Colossus has to go further down.
[6151.07s -> 6166.37s]  I'm okay with this so far, but maybe not. We'll see. This is a Fallout wallpaper
[6166.93s -> 6170.53s]  for your computer, for desktop. I don't know which one it is, so I'm going to say I don't know.
[6172.11s -> 6177.65s]  No, it's four hours. It's probably Fallout 3. Wait, no, I played Fallout 3 on stream for
[6179.78s -> 6187.04s]  four hours. Six hours maybe total. I've never played a Pokemon game before. Does it count
[6187.04s -> 6190.56s]  before hour Andy if I tried to stream it but it didn't work and I tried to play it? Not really.
[6192.35s -> 6203.38s]  Logic 2. Never played it. Um, which Hitman is this? Uh, belongs up here somewhere. I'll
[6203.38s -> 6213.34s]  figure it out later. We, something Play 2? Just Dance? No. Counter-Strike Source
[6216.77s -> 6221.65s]  is just going to go right next to Counter-Strike. One slot above because it has better graphics.
[6221.65s -> 6233.04s]  Let's Counter-Strike Go. Oh, well, whatever. It doesn't matter. Dead by Daylight, have never
[6233.04s -> 6240.90s]  played it. I actually played and beat this whole game and I had one incredibly major complaint.
[6240.90s -> 6246.50s]  This, the DuckTales remake was good. The music was great. It was awesome reimagining. Um, they,
[6246.50s -> 6254.69s]  there were way too many cutscenes. There's a cutscene every other screen in this game.
[6254.69s -> 6259.82s]  I, it was like come, just let me play the fucking game. It was like cutscene, cutscene, cutscene,
[6259.82s -> 6271.81s]  cutscene in like the remake of DuckTales the game. There's too many cutscenes. It was decent.
[6271.81s -> 6285.47s]  Why is Tetris in bed? Because I hate that game. In fact, it's going down because you just reminded
[6285.47s -> 6294.26s]  me to rethink of what I, why I put it here. I hate Tetris. I don't, I do not like it. I hate
[6294.26s -> 6303.20s]  this game. I know, like Tetris 99 came out and it's, what a cool idea. It was such a dumb, stupid,
[6303.20s -> 6308.26s]  horrible, shitty video game. And then they came out with the Super Mario one and that one was
[6308.26s -> 6316.56s]  really good. I'm sorry. I know people, some of you probably really like this Tetris and it's,
[6317.20s -> 6322.82s]  I just hate it. I hate it. I've always hated it. And it's because I'm not good at it.
[6322.82s -> 6328.11s]  I'm not good enough to play it, to be good at it. And that angers me and it makes me not like it.
[6328.75s -> 6336.14s]  So take that as you will. Mad because bad. That's yes. Yes. Mad because I, I, I hate Tetris because
[6336.14s -> 6350.00s]  I'm not good at it. At least it's better than the Avengers game. Don't you feel like the Avengers
[6350.00s -> 6356.99s]  game was a dream you had? Wow. The Avengers game so hyped up for the Avengers. Like that's the
[6356.99s -> 6362.61s]  dream where like you think it's real, but the thing it wasn't real. Wow. How awesome would it
[6362.61s -> 6373.95s]  be to have a never ending like action adventure, like kind of you, you watch words, an action
[6373.95s -> 6381.31s]  adventure game where you play as the Avengers and you go and fight stuff and it doesn't end.
[6381.31s -> 6384.91s]  And it's like a game as a service kind of thing. And they keep adding stuff and there's like boss
[6384.91s -> 6389.63s]  fights. It's like multiplayer. We've wanted that for so long, Gordy. We've wanted that for so long,
[6389.63s -> 6396.64s]  Gordy. And yeah, yeah, I know. But I feel like I dreamt that and then it wasn't, it didn't exist.
[6401.28s -> 6409.81s]  Hold on. Somebody said, somebody just said this. Is Genshin Impact a better Marvel Avengers game?
[6409.81s -> 6422.67s]  It is, right? It has to be. I would love to play it. First time I downloaded Genshin Impact on my
[6422.67s -> 6428.30s]  iPad, I got a black screen. I could walk around with the character, but the entire environment
[6428.30s -> 6434.70s]  was black. Couldn't play it. Uninstalled it. Two or three fucking months later, I go back and I
[6434.70s -> 6444.19s]  reinstall it. This time, I can't even get to the actual main menu of the video game. I sure would
[6444.19s -> 6450.30s]  have loved to have played it on my iPad. So I uninstalled it again. So maybe like another two
[6450.30s -> 6456.93s]  or three months after they do some more bug fixes on the iPad version, I'll try it again. I'm not
[6456.93s -> 6463.68s]  going to play it on PC. No, I want to lie in bed and just run around and hit stuff until I pick up
[6463.76s -> 6470.54s]  loot cases and stuff. I don't want to play that on PC. That's not a PC game to me.
[6470.54s -> 6478.85s]  That's a like in the bath game to me. That's a like sprinkle in some bath salts and like light
[6478.85s -> 6485.89s]  a candle and just play Genshin Impact for like 30 minutes and then get out of the bath. That's not
[6485.89s -> 6501.84s]  a PC game for me. You're a crackhead. Stop getting sidetracked on the most random shit. Take every
[6501.84s -> 6509.26s]  stream I've ever done and pull out the times I get sidetracked and if it's less than 60% of everything
[6509.26s -> 6517.92s]  I've ever recorded, you win. If getting sidetracked is not like at least 60%, then you win.
[6521.54s -> 6526.10s]  I don't know why you don't really win anything. You win the thought. You win knowing that you
[6526.10s -> 6535.82s]  were right. No, don't triple the debt. No. Lance vs. Zombies. This is the first one, so it belongs
[6535.82s -> 6544.54s]  up here. The second one, I would love to just like snot rocket it out of existence on here.
[6544.54s -> 6553.68s]  It better not be even on here. Mountain Blade Warband. You know where that goes. Last of Us
[6553.68s -> 6564.42s]  Part 2 didn't play it. Journey didn't play it. Um, this is, this is Near didn't play it. Kingdom
[6564.42s -> 6570.85s]  Hearts 3 didn't play it. Rainbow Six Siege, 4-hour Andy. Death Stranding didn't play it.
[6570.85s -> 6581.46s]  Animal Crossing, 4-hour Andy. System Shock 2 never played it. Divinity never played it. Dying Light
[6581.46s -> 6590.05s]  was, was okay. I wouldn't put it in like best game ever. Untitled Goose Game was better than Dying
[6590.05s -> 6596.86s]  Light for me. It belongs somewhere up here into good. We'll figure that out in a minute. Oblivion.
[6596.86s -> 6605.63s]  I streamed it like two or three times for what? Three, four hours each? That's not 4-hour Andy.
[6605.63s -> 6613.50s]  It was all right. I had fun. I can't believe this is even on here. It's like honestly,
[6613.50s -> 6622.13s]  I'm 4-hour Andy. Yeah. Dawn of War 1? If it's Dawn of, if it's Warhammer 40k Dawn of War, then
[6622.13s -> 6633.14s]  it belongs up here. I loved the original Dawn of War. I thought it was fantastic. It belongs up here.
[6633.14s -> 6639.92s]  We'll figure it out. Turkey Sandwich. All right, so I got, I've gotten to the point where I haven't
[6639.92s -> 6643.44s]  played any video games in my whole life and I thought this was the list to choose from.
[6643.44s -> 6652.00s]  No, we're almost done. I didn't play Sly Cooper. I never played NBA 2K20. No Pokemon games ever.
[6652.00s -> 6657.71s]  I never played Persona. Never played Grounded. I don't even know what this is, so I'm gonna say
[6657.71s -> 6674.27s]  no. No More Heroes 2 belongs up here. No More Heroes 1 is better. It's not, in a way.
[6674.27s -> 6680.18s]  Oh, Tsushima. I really wanted to play Ghost of Tsushima. Metal Gear Solid. I think this is,
[6680.18s -> 6687.92s]  Metal Gear Solid is fantastic. That's gotta go up to amazing. Okay, I'll find the play
[6687.92s -> 6693.90s]  sport in a minute. Didn't play Yakuza. Didn't play Call of Duty Cold War. I didn't play Doom
[6693.90s -> 6702.59s]  Eternal. Didn't, no Crusader Kings. No Bayonetta. No Super Limital. No Wasteland 3. Oh, Hades.
[6702.59s -> 6716.13s]  This goes into, this goes into great. Where? We'll find out. I don't know what that is.
[6716.13s -> 6729.09s]  Payday 2 belongs in 4-hour Andy. Half-Life Alyx. I talked about this when I beat Half-Life Alyx.
[6729.09s -> 6741.66s]  Half-Life Alyx is better than Half-Life 2, and that's recorded now. I think it is.
[6743.65s -> 6762.02s]  That's wrong. I don't think it is. Where is Half-Life 2? This is a lie. This is, this is a lie.
[6762.98s -> 6774.26s]  This has to be up here because I, I game on PC. It's not true. That's not true for me, and I have
[6774.26s -> 6780.32s]  to break out of the, out of the deceit and the lying. I don't think that Half-Life 2 is like a
[6780.32s -> 6792.96s]  masterpiece. I think Portal 2 is more fun. I think I enjoyed Portal 2 more than Half-Life 2. I'm
[6792.96s -> 6805.15s]  sorry. I still find it to be very, very good. I just, I think Half-Life Alyx is better. By a lot.
[6805.15s -> 6824.42s]  I'm calling Gabe? Yeah, call him. Sure. And tell him that the next one in the series was way better
[6824.42s -> 6830.03s]  than the last one. I'm sure he's gonna be really happy. Imagine knowing that you tried to live up
[6830.03s -> 6835.07s]  to Half-Life 2 and somebody said it was better than Half-Life 2. He's gonna be real fucking
[6835.07s -> 6841.20s]  happy to hear that. He's gonna be ecstatic to know that because they were very concerned about that.
[6841.20s -> 6845.28s]  Like, oh, how do we do another Half-Life? Can we live up to Half-Life 2? Oh, you, oh, you,
[6845.28s -> 6856.51s]  you guys did. I thought it was fantastic. Where is it right now? That was Game of the Year last
[6856.51s -> 6861.31s]  year too. That was the best game that came out last year. And Hades. But Half-Life Alyx is better
[6861.31s -> 6867.38s]  than Hades. This shit wasn't even, it wasn't even nominated. This wasn't even nominated for Game of
[6867.38s -> 6871.86s]  the Year. And it was the best game that came out last year. Are we gonna judge things based on how
[6871.86s -> 6888.00s]  good they were? That was like the most fun I had in a video game last year. Yeah, there are some
[6888.00s -> 6895.39s]  movies that get nominated for awards that are in select theaters. So what's the difference? It's
[6895.39s -> 6910.05s]  VR. VR is expensive. Viewers are dropping. What do I do? Hold on. Uh, make noises and make sounds.
[6911.52s -> 6919.47s]  Uh, how do I get them to stay? Make, I gotta make sounds and make noises. Quick, do doi doi doi.
[6928.34s -> 6929.94s]  I, I don't know how to do it. I broke it.
[6933.01s -> 6941.52s]  I don't, I don't know how to do it anymore. I think I fucked it up. Of course I know how to do it.
[6942.08s -> 6952.21s]  Shovel Knight. Didn't play it. Not even 4-hour indie. I think I opened it on Steam
[6952.77s -> 6955.98s]  and like jumped around for like 10 minutes or something and then was like,
[6955.98s -> 6960.29s]  I'll play this later. And I played it. Don't know what that is. Don't know what this is.
[6960.29s -> 6966.08s]  Didn't play the Batman game. Hollow Knight. That's, that's more than four hours, right?
[6966.08s -> 6977.28s]  I streamed this like two or three times. Was this four hours? I really liked it.
[6977.84s -> 6984.98s]  The reason why I could never go back to Hollow Knight was because I got halfway through the game
[6984.98s -> 6990.40s]  and then didn't play it for, what, like four or five months? And the game is a,
[6991.22s -> 6995.86s]  it's one of those, you have to remember where everything is. This huge map with all the
[6995.86s -> 6999.86s]  different areas. And this one, you have to have the jump. You have to have the dash to go over here.
[6999.86s -> 7003.30s]  And I just forgot everything. And I would have had to restart the whole game. I didn't want to
[7003.30s -> 7008.34s]  restart the entire game because I already did it. And it was like four months ago. Maybe I could,
[7008.34s -> 7019.47s]  maybe I, I don't know. Should I restart it? I will help you. I thought it was really fun.
[7020.03s -> 7035.41s]  Oh, I think it's too late. I think it's too late. I did like it though. Uh, never played it.
[7035.41s -> 7042.32s]  Didn't play it. Uh, I don't know what that is. I think it's Final Fantasy. Subnautica. That's,
[7042.32s -> 7050.27s]  you know where that goes. Warzone. Didn't play it. Titanfall God. This is Titanfall 2. I didn't
[7050.27s -> 7058.67s]  even play it. Orion the Blind Forest. Didn't play it. Mega Man? No. Is that Mega Man? Samurai
[7058.67s -> 7066.51s]  Warrior. Oh, um, I don't know what that is. Saints Row the Third. I didn't, I didn't even play it.
[7066.51s -> 7075.50s]  Maybe for like 10 minutes. Flight Simulator. Didn't even play it. Hitman. This is Hitman.
[7075.50s -> 7086.46s]  Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This goes up here. Okay. Before I get this completely done,
[7086.46s -> 7092.14s]  before I do this and fix this, I want to tell you what my favorite ice creams are because I
[7092.14s -> 7098.34s]  got to get that out of the way really fast. Vanilla. B. Rocky Road. I'm going to, I'm not
[7098.34s -> 7106.75s]  going to think about it. Rocky Road. C. Peanut Butter. D. Pistachio. A. Birthday Cake. Way too,
[7106.75s -> 7110.82s]  it's kind of good, but it's way too sugary, way too heavy. Cheesecake. Strawberry cheesecake. A.
[7110.82s -> 7120.77s]  Eggnog. D. Cherry. D. I don't know. Peppermint. C. Bubblegum. D. Rum Raisin. D. Mint Chip. B.
[7120.77s -> 7123.81s]  Brownie Batter. That's somewhere, that's up here. Hold on, don't even think about it. Lemon Custard.
[7123.81s -> 7130.88s]  D. Coffee. You have to be in the mood for it. C. Uh, Creamsicle. Like a cre, like Creamsicle. Creamsicle.
[7130.88s -> 7141.97s]  B. Peach. C. Mango. B. Neapolitan. Moostrex. B. Beer. D. Blue Moon. Don't even know what it is. D.
[7142.53s -> 7147.71s]  Chocolate. B. Superman. Don't even know what that is. That looks like fucking Play-Doh.
[7148.35s -> 7155.66s]  This is Play-Doh. That's not real, that's not ice cream. Cotton Candy. D. Black Raspberry. B.
[7155.66s -> 7162.35s]  Coconut. C. Raspberry Ripple. I don't even know what this is. Grape. C. Cookies and Cream. S.
[7162.83s -> 7171.23s]  Chocolate Chip. Basic. Strawberry. S. Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. S. Butter Pecan. Without the
[7171.23s -> 7176.75s]  pecans in it. S. With pecan, if I, I, I put the pecans in my mouth and I get the ice cream off
[7176.75s -> 7188.08s]  and I spit it back in the container. Until, uh, this is just ice cream. Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
[7188.08s -> 7232.21s]  Alright. No. Peppermint is, Mint Chip is just way better. No, it's not done. Now it is. There you go.
[7232.21s -> 7239.12s]  Alright, back to what we were doing. Alright, this is important. We're gonna start from the bottom up.
[7239.12s -> 7244.78s]  So, of all the games that I have only played for four hours, what's the one I think is the best?
[7244.78s -> 7252.13s]  Probably Odyssey. It's not, not Dota. Not Borderlands. No way. I've played The Sims for
[7252.13s -> 7257.79s]  longer than that. But The Sims 4 is not even the best one. It's like The Sims 2 or The Sims 3.
[7257.79s -> 7266.54s]  I should play The Sims 1. Alright, mark this on your calendar. I'm gonna play The Sims 1. Like,
[7266.54s -> 7274.16s]  soon. In the next week or two. Like two, three weeks from now or something. It's alright. Okay.
[7274.24s -> 7283.54s]  So, definitely not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. I put all these games I put in,
[7283.54s -> 7286.50s]  like, the same category. Like, I just, I've only played them for, like, a few hours and I don't,
[7286.50s -> 7298.59s]  like, all the four-hour games have to be in the same place except for Mario Galaxy. Horrible.
[7298.59s -> 7303.47s]  Uh, Avengers is probably the worst game ever, right? Like, it has to be. Mario Kart, I don't
[7303.47s -> 7308.50s]  like the Mario Kart. It's not overcooked. This doesn't belong here. Four-hour, Andy. I only
[7308.50s -> 7316.34s]  played it for, like, three hours on stream with, like, italics. Alright, that's perfect. That's
[7316.34s -> 7324.29s]  more accurate for me. Alright, um, Until Dawn, I just don't think that, I don't think they're
[7324.29s -> 7328.21s]  bad games. I just don't think they belong, like, really on the list of best games ever,
[7328.21s -> 7344.75s]  but we'll just keep it here. Modern Warfare 3 better than Warframe? No. Is Far Cry 3 better
[7344.75s -> 7364.38s]  than Modern Warfare 3? Is Until Dawn better than Modern Warfare? Yes. Yes. No. Okay, that's,
[7364.38s -> 7370.18s]  that's fine. Alright, now this is really important. Is Warframe better than Far Cry 3? Yes. Is
[7370.74s -> 7380.78s]  DuckTales Remastered better than Warframe? No. Warframe moves up. Is Mordhau better than
[7380.78s -> 7406.45s]  Hearthstone? Hearthstone's better than Firewatch. I mean, what? Firewatch was cool, but it just,
[7406.45s -> 7413.81s]  it did, it was, I liked the experience, but it was just, alright, let me just tell you. I was one of
[7413.81s -> 7419.54s]  those, I was one of those, I, look, the game's been on for, like, fucking seven years. I was one of
[7419.54s -> 7435.06s]  those people, I, I didn't like the ending. I didn't like the end of the movie. Is it? And
[7435.06s -> 7440.30s]  I felt like the entire thing was building up to the end of the movie, and I wasn't a big,
[7440.30s -> 7446.18s]  I didn't really like the end of the movie. I liked the movie, I liked the experience. I did,
[7446.18s -> 7450.66s]  it was a good, it was fun, it was, it was decent, it was good, but I felt like the whole thing was
[7450.66s -> 7454.75s]  leading up to the end, and I was like, well, I didn't really like the end. If the whole thing
[7454.75s -> 7460.80s]  was leading up to the end for me, then I wasn't a big fan. The photos were, yeah, it was alright,
[7460.80s -> 7469.02s]  it was fun. For those of you that don't know, The Photos Are In is my favorite video that I ever
[7469.02s -> 7475.71s]  made on the channel. That's my favorite video. I get asked that all the time, and it's hard for me
[7475.71s -> 7485.58s]  to pick, but that's, like, that's my favorite video I ever made. Derma Rumble Live was awesome,
[7486.53s -> 7490.45s]  but I, I don't know, I still think that that's, like, my favorite video I ever made.
[7491.25s -> 7498.18s]  That's the video I show people when I introduce them to you. Well, that's a weird one to pick.
[7499.81s -> 7508.30s]  Anyways, Portal is better than Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike's better than Dying Light,
[7508.94s -> 7512.46s]  Dead Rising's better than Dying Light, it's just a, it's just a better version of the same kind of
[7512.46s -> 7516.54s]  game for me. No More Heroes is better than Dying Light, all these are better than Dying Light,
[7516.54s -> 7526.08s]  all of them. Smite is definitely, no, it belongs here. Dying Light just really kind of belongs all
[7526.08s -> 7536.26s]  the way down here. Yeah, it was alright, it was good, yeah, it was good, but, alright. Name me one
[7536.26s -> 7542.30s]  character's name from Dying Light. Any character in the whole game, name me a character's name.
[7542.30s -> 7558.85s]  You understand? Kyle Crane. If you just, you can't just go to Google and type in
[7559.73s -> 7567.49s]  Dying Light characters and just pick one, you know what I mean. I can't, I can't name you one,
[7567.49s -> 7578.62s]  they're all just a, just blank face. I can't name you anything. All I remember is me and Sterr
[7578.62s -> 7584.51s]  chasing this weird zombie around and he ran into a fence and killed himself. That's the only thing
[7584.51s -> 7590.19s]  I remember, that's the only thing I pulled from that game. It's on, sorry, it's on, it's on Sterr's
[7590.19s -> 7600.59s]  video. It was really funny. And I remember Sterr throwing an axe into somebody's head.
[7600.59s -> 7606.46s]  Somebody was like standing there like we were looting somebody and like an axe just hits him
[7606.46s -> 7614.53s]  in the skull. Oh my god, what's with my eyes? And then, oh, that's where the meme is from,
[7614.53s -> 7618.93s]  that's where Coffee's Cheeto, that's where that's from. But that was a secret video, that was not
[7618.93s -> 7627.89s]  in the main video. That's a secret video, that's not the main one. Alright, let's continue. I think
[7627.89s -> 7635.95s]  I like where this is all standing right now. Whose is better than That'll Get Rising? Is it
[7635.95s -> 7642.42s]  Limbo's? Okay, Star Wars, this has got Star Wars in it, it's better than Overwatch. Alright,
[7642.42s -> 7649.57s]  now it's going to get tricky. This is where it becomes hard. I really did like Shadow of War,
[7649.57s -> 7656.66s]  I thought it was fantastic. This goes down, this goes down, this goes down, this goes down,
[7656.66s -> 7663.63s]  this comes up, this goes down, this goes up, this goes down, this goes down, this goes down,
[7663.63s -> 7674.64s]  this goes down, this one goes down, this goes down, this goes up, actually, this one goes way up,
[7674.64s -> 7687.15s]  way, way, way, way up, this goes up, that goes down, that goes, this goes up, this goes up,
[7687.15s -> 7700.05s]  that goes down, that goes down, so does this, this one does too, to here, this one goes down too,
[7700.05s -> 7715.68s]  that one goes down as well, this one goes up. We got it? Yep, this goes down.
[7721.68s -> 7739.78s]  Prairie was like more fun than Metal Gear, no it wasn't. Close. Level up for Shadow of War. Shadow
[7739.78s -> 7745.86s]  of War is better than Plants vs. Zombies. God, yell at me. Metro, is Shadow of War better than
[7745.86s -> 7772.62s]  Metro 2033? That's very close. Say 2033 33 times. 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033,
[7772.70s -> 7781.90s]  2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033,
[7781.90s -> 7790.54s]  2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033,
[7790.54s -> 7802.18s]  2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033,
[7802.50s -> 7812.46s]  doing that made me realize it's better than Shadow of War. Thank you. Oh, you know, you guys ever
[7812.46s -> 7818.46s]  look in the mirror and you get terrified, not of losing this, not of having like, like get crow's
[7818.46s -> 7824.06s]  feet here. No, no, no, no. How many of you guys have fucking horrified at the notion of eventually
[7824.06s -> 7836.37s]  having this? Like, I don't want that. Like, I don't, I don't want that. And it's going to happen to
[7836.37s -> 7847.82s]  everybody. Just that like sagging, weird fat pocket that's under the chin. I, I get,
[7847.82s -> 7852.94s]  make me bald, have me have crow's feet, wrinkles everywhere. Do not give me the turkey neck. I
[7852.94s -> 7857.74s]  don't want it. It's, I, it's one thing I really don't want. And it's already kind of happening.
[7857.74s -> 7868.30s]  We're gonna do like exercises. You like go put your chin up, right? You have to do exercises.
[7870.42s -> 7881.50s]  Uh, Plants vs. Obvious is going down and Hotline Miami is going up. So is Celeste.
[7889.28s -> 7895.39s]  Spider-Man was better than, oh, that's tough. Sekiro was not better than Cuphead. Sekiro was,
[7896.27s -> 7917.20s]  this is hard. Now it's really hard. Um, Sekiro was good, but Dark Souls is leveling up.
[7917.20s -> 7928.19s]  And so was Dark Souls 3. Left 4 Dead 2 was very good, but it's going down. Red Dead's leveling
[7928.19s -> 7939.38s]  up to great. Fallout was, mm-hmm. Yep. This is leveling up as well. The losing viewers.
[7939.86s -> 7946.38s]  Well, it's because every time I move a game that's your favorite game up a slot or down a slot that
[7946.38s -> 7951.46s]  you didn't agree with, you leave. So when I just put left, when I just went from Left 4 Dead from
[7951.46s -> 7958.82s]  two, from great to very good, this is somebody here's favorite video game. And they went and
[7958.82s -> 7964.00s]  they fucking click the X. And it happens for every single one of these, because statistically
[7964.00s -> 7969.89s]  speaking, if there's 14,000 people here, somebody in here has a favorite game on this list. It's
[7969.89s -> 7973.89s]  every single one of you. Like this is somebody's. This is somebody's. This is somebody's. All of
[7973.89s -> 7981.42s]  this is somebody's favorite game. So when I take Cuphead and I go like this, two, three, 400 people
[7981.42s -> 7990.74s]  just collect X. That's how it works. All right, let's go. Is Mario 2 better than Left 4 Dead 2?
[7990.74s -> 8028.45s]  They both have two in it. Level up. Level up. Level up. D level. D level. No, no way. You know
[8028.45s -> 8058.59s]  what? D level. Resident Evil 2 was more fun for me than Dark Souls 3. Is Minecraft better than
[8058.59s -> 8082.48s]  Dark Souls 3? Half Life 2 is. The Half Life games are better than Dawn of War and Hades and Cuphead.
[8082.48s -> 8092.46s]  Yeah, they are. They are. BioShock is definitely. Oh, this is going to make people so angry.
[8094.98s -> 8102.19s]  Me even, me even remotely considering scrolling my mouse this way. Put this in front of this.
[8102.75s -> 8132.72s]  It's not good for a lot of you. I'm considering it. It's close. I played way more. It has to go
[8132.72s -> 8137.98s]  down there. That's fair. That's accurate. Like it has to be down in 4 hour ante.
[8138.70s -> 8151.41s]  Because I only played it for like fucking five hours. None of these other games that I played
[8151.41s -> 8161.30s]  for four hours, right? No, I've played a shitload of all of these up here. Yeah. All right. This is
[8161.30s -> 8172.35s]  good. I'm happy with this. Minecraft is better than Resident Evil. Minecraft is better. Minecraft is
[8172.35s -> 8180.90s]  better than Hitman. Hitman is. Resident Evil. Yeah, Hitman got D leveled. Sorry, you got D ranked.
[8180.90s -> 8186.53s]  Oh. Oh, how far is Hitman going to fall here though? Is Cuphead better than Hitman? Yeah.
[8186.53s -> 8194.30s]  Hades better than Hitman. Close. Yeah. Isaac. Yeah. Here we go. This is where it gets much harder.
[8194.30s -> 8206.70s]  I think that's where it stops. Look, if Pac-Man gets to be up here and Doom Classic gets to be
[8206.70s -> 8213.81s]  over here, Minecraft, like Minecraft is one of those games that's going to be the Pac-Man when
[8213.81s -> 8233.31s]  you and I have 50. Okay. I'm done. Wait, Half-Life 2 better than Dark Souls 3?
[8234.19s -> 8244.30s]  Yes. All of these are better than Dark Souls 3. All right. Half-Life 2 better than Resident Evil 2.
[8254.72s -> 8263.98s]  No, it's not. Not for me. I loved Resident Evil 2. I loved it. It was like my favorite game of the
[8263.98s -> 8273.66s]  year. I thought that was fantastic. I loved it. Like when I finished Half-Life 2, I was like,
[8273.66s -> 8279.26s]  wow, that was awesome. That was unbelievable. When I finished Resident Evil 2, I said,
[8280.06s -> 8292.03s]  that's one of the best games ever. I said that kind of, maybe I should just level it up. Yeah,
[8292.03s -> 8299.10s]  it's leveled up. And by the way, Fallout New Vegas just got leveled up too. And guess what? Doom is
[8299.10s -> 8304.45s]  going down here. I don't care. A game came out in the fucking sixties or whatever. I don't care.
[8305.18s -> 8315.36s]  It's classic. Sure. But what's it doing up here? These two have to be next to each other because
[8315.36s -> 8326.43s]  they're about to fight each other. Mirror. That's fair. Pac-Man does not go down too. I love
[8326.43s -> 8341.06s]  Pac-Man. It goes down here. Because that means Half-Life 2 is like the best in its category for
[8341.06s -> 8351.12s]  like a great game. But the other games up here on this list, I need to just triple check and make
[8351.12s -> 8358.99s]  sure I had more fun in them than I did Half-Life 2. Because this is now the barometer for like a
[8359.07s -> 8374.14s]  great, very, very, just great experience. Find out. Pac-Man. Fine. Fine. Resident Evil 2 stays up
[8374.14s -> 8385.82s]  here. Minecraft that's staying up here. Ocarina of Time. I put the nostalgic glasses just on.
[8386.54s -> 8414.75s]  Ocarina of Time. Dark Souls 1. I got to find the one that's like, what is my fucking favorite game
[8414.75s -> 8420.03s]  that's not quite masterpiece. What is it? Or does one of these get leveled up? It does.
[8421.22s -> 8426.21s]  GTA 4 is a, is a fucking masterpiece. One of the most revolutionary games ever made.
[8427.34s -> 8433.82s]  It had so much going on. So much to do. It changed everything. It was a, it was one of the first true
[8433.82s -> 8441.97s]  real living open world games. It's a masterpiece. GTA 4 is a masterpiece. It is. I think it belongs
[8441.97s -> 8461.60s]  up here. What about San Andreas? San Andreas is not on this list. Resident Evil 4. Okay, hold on.
[8462.24s -> 8466.24s]  Metal Gear's got to go down here. It's an amazing game, but it's not, it's not quite up here.
[8466.96s -> 8482.38s]  Where would I put San Andreas? Honestly? Probably right behind GTA 4. Or right here. I, I, GTA 4 is
[8482.38s -> 8488.99s]  like one of my favorite games ever. I like loved this game. It was, I loved it. Maybe down here.
[8488.99s -> 8504.29s]  Like right here. Okay. Was Resident Evil 2 better than Mario Galaxy for me? Yes. Was Mario Galaxy
[8504.29s -> 8520.43s]  better than Warcraft 3? Yeah. I think so. Was Undertale better than Warcraft 3? No. Was Shadow
[8520.43s -> 8533.74s]  the Colossus better than Undertale? Wait. I think I actually broke a controller with Shadow the
[8533.74s -> 8540.56s]  Colossus. I think like the, I, the grip was, I couldn't grip. Like it was, I hated the control
[8540.56s -> 8557.10s]  scheme. And I think I literally like broke a controller in half. Like 15, 20 years ago. True.
[8557.10s -> 8585.10s]  Is Metal Gear Solid better than Undertale? Yes. Is Metal Gear Solid better than Warcraft 3? Yes.
[8586.42s -> 8595.07s]  Is Metal Gear Solid better than Mario Galaxy? Yes. Is Metal Gear Solid better than Resident
[8595.07s -> 8614.58s]  Evil 2? No. Is Resident Evil 2 better than Ocarina of Time? Is Ocarina of Time better than
[8614.58s -> 8633.63s]  Minecraft? Is Metal Gear Solid better than Dark Souls 1? We have to go back and take,
[8633.63s -> 8647.89s]  we have to go, we have to go back here. It is. Is Half-Life Alyx better than Portal 2?
[8650.06s -> 8683.26s]  Yes. Is Portal 2 better than Minecraft? Is GTA 5 better than Ocarina of Time? GTA 5 better than
[8683.26s -> 8702.99s]  Resident Evil 2? It's, no it is. Yes it is. Is it better than Minecraft? Yes it is. Is it better
[8702.99s -> 8709.42s]  than Portal 2? No. Yes it is. Wait, isn't this, this is where it just was. Wasn't this just where
[8709.42s -> 8723.86s]  it was before? Is Resident Evil 4 better than World of Warcraft? No. That got knocked down.
[8724.58s -> 8732.94s]  Is Half-Life Alyx better than World of Warcraft? Think, think really hard on this. No it's not.
[8733.50s -> 8737.62s]  It's not. I had so many wonderful memories in World of Warcraft back in like 2005.
[8738.26s -> 8749.20s]  This is, nothing will be able to cross this. This is not going up here, but nothing will cross that.
[8749.20s -> 8770.13s]  Portal 2 better than Resident Evil 4? No. Is Resident Evil 4 better than GTA 5? Yes. I think
[8770.13s -> 8788.69s]  so. It's so close. It's by like 0.01%. Alright. Team Fortress 2 or Diablo 2 or Bloodborne. Let's
[8788.69s -> 8791.49s]  see. I think this, I think I'm done with this. Wait, is Undertale, it's Undertale better than
[8791.49s -> 8798.61s]  Warcraft 3? Is Mario Galaxy better than Metal Gear Solid? Is Zelda better than Dark Souls?
[8798.61s -> 8811.52s]  Let's find out in this video. I feel like I'm making a fucking like top 10 list. Oh, I hate
[8811.52s -> 8840.10s]  to do that, but I'm gonna. I'm done. This is, this is it. I really believe that Team Fortress 2
[8841.14s -> 8848.43s]  is the best video game ever made. It's the best game ever made. It just is.
[8849.98s -> 8858.46s]  Now, it might not be that supported right now, but holy shit, back in like 2010, 2011, 2012,
[8859.10s -> 8877.26s]  this is the best game ever made. Ever. Is Bloodborne better than D2 though?
[8878.46s -> 8885.78s]  Yeah. Is D2 better than GTA 4? Yeah. Is Chrono Trigger better than Bloodborne? No. I think this
[8885.78s -> 8897.98s]  is accurate. 2013 was peak TF2. Nothing can come close. I have never cared about a video game more
[8897.98s -> 8910.13s]  than I did TF2. 2010, 2011 to like 2015. Oh God, nothing will ever come close. If this is a barometer
[8910.13s -> 8916.29s]  for where a video game has to cross to be better, like a best game ever made. Oh, you've, it's,
[8916.29s -> 8922.34s]  you've got a long way to go. So here's, look at, see these two. I find Bloodborne to be one of the
[8922.34s -> 8929.63s]  best games ever made. I do. This is not even close. If we're talking about a scale, okay, this is like
[8929.63s -> 8936.08s]  the best game ever made for me. And this is like a second best game ever made. You're talking about
[8936.08s -> 8945.84s]  like, like 50 points to go to cross from here to here. If TF2 is like a 100, Bloodborne's like a 60
[8945.84s -> 8951.30s]  and like everything else is underneath it. It's so impossible to cross that threshold.
[8951.30s -> 8957.06s]  Somebody has to do something insane. TF2 is on its own tier. That's yeah. Now that's,
[8957.06s -> 8969.98s]  that's accurate. I really, that's true. It belongs up there. It does. And literally everything else
[8970.06s -> 8972.54s]  will never come close. Like maybe one day somebody will make something that is.
[8973.18s -> 8978.16s]  Where's Stardew Valley? Cause that's like, that actually like belongs up here somewhere.
[8979.95s -> 8991.30s]  Okay. So Stardew Valley is not on this list. Hay Day a Facebook game is. That's weird. Okay.
[8991.30s -> 8995.22s]  Can I pretend this is Stardew Valley? Cause like Hay Day, like farming or something. All right.
[8995.22s -> 9020.30s]  This is, this is Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley better than Resident Evil 4. I think so. Hay Day.
[9021.92s -> 9026.40s]  This is, I got 5,000 hours on Hay Day, man. I'm number one in my Facebook group.
[9026.96s -> 9036.45s]  Now it's perfect. All right. There it is. There's, there's your video game. Tetris sucks. I hate
[9036.45s -> 9044.32s]  that game. And that's it. That's going to be the stream. Um, so I've got to figure out,
[9045.36s -> 9053.68s]  I've got to figure out what this is. I can figure out what this means. I wonder,
[9053.68s -> 9066.30s]  I wonder what he wants me to find. Grandpa. I will see you guys on Saturday. What are you
[9066.30s -> 9072.70s]  going to do? Tetris stream? What about Slime Rancher? Uh, Slime Rancher is like up here
[9072.70s -> 9082.34s]  somewhere. No, it's not. It's like here. Where the fuck is Dark Souls 2? Do you really think
[9082.34s -> 9089.02s]  Dark Souls 2 should be on this list? I mean, it could be. It may be, but it would be down here.
[9094.99s -> 9098.75s]  Oh, this, we'll do the same as one after the stream on Saturday at some point,
[9100.22s -> 9105.81s]  some point. We'll see. I will see you guys on Saturday. That's the next time you're going to
[9105.81s -> 9108.93s]  see me. I'm going to look directly at you because I'm telling you Saturday at 1 PM Pacific. I might
[9108.93s -> 9113.76s]  think about figuring out where that, what, what this is. I'm going to go explore. I'm just going
[9113.76s -> 9122.29s]  to go explore now and just see if I can find anything. It might even be in the same damn close.
[9122.85s -> 9130.83s]  Yeah, we'll see you on Saturday. Uh, that's been the stream. Just wanted to hang out for a few
[9130.83s -> 9134.27s]  hours and just say what's up and hang out with you guys. Uh, didn't I say, I said the stream was
[9134.27s -> 9139.23s]  going to be 45 minutes, didn't I? Well, that was wrong. I've been here for like three and a half
[9139.23s -> 9149.42s]  hours. Have a wonderful rest of your evening. Take care of yourselves. I'll see you guys on
[9149.42s -> 9161.74s]  Saturday at 1 PM Pacific. Look at how, look at that. Oh my goodness. That's so many subscriptions.
[9163.07s -> 9168.78s]  Oh my God. Uh, but all in all, I hope that Saturday's fun.
[9171.28s -> 9176.38s]  It seems to be that there will be a lot of interesting things to do.
[9176.38s -> 9192.66s]  We'll see. See you Saturday. Take care of yourselves. Archaeology. Wonders of archaeology.
[9195.50s -> 9200.14s]  Uh, raid? Uh, yeah. Who's, who's, let's see. Who's live right now? Or maybe we,
[9200.14s -> 9212.38s]  maybe we picked somebody we've never raided before. Maybe. Let's see who's live. Uh,
[9222.53s -> 9226.59s]  hmm. Time for, time for networking Andy.
[9241.42s -> 9247.23s]  Or somebody we haven't raided. You know, we haven't, we've not raided, uh, critical in a long
[9247.23s -> 9257.87s]  time. What are you doing? The big man is here. It's been a very long time. Go say hello to moist
[9257.87s -> 9271.01s]  critical. And no raid song, no raid song shit anymore. No more, no more raid songs. Charlie's
[9271.01s -> 9275.10s]  going to look over and he's going to be like, what the fuck are you guys talking about? He's
[9275.10s -> 9278.78s]  going to be like, shut up. He's going to be like, what are you talking about? So many people have
[9278.78s -> 9282.06s]  no idea what you guys are talking about. And then I, and then I have to figure out how am I going
[9282.06s -> 9290.10s]  to like cover for you guys. Oh, hey, uh, yeah. I mean, uh, we're just getting around. Uh, we're
[9290.10s -> 9297.58s]  just like funny, you know, having fun. I told you, I got a DM one time that was just like,
[9297.58s -> 9310.11s]  don't you fucking ever do that again. Now go, go say hello to, uh, critical. I just type slash
[9310.11s -> 9323.39s]  moist slash moist. It's not what I want it to slash raid moist. Okay. I'll see you guys on,
[9325.63s -> 9335.39s]  uh, let me make sure I get it right. I'll see you guys on Saturday. Have a good day. Have a good
[9335.39s -> 9350.51s]  night. Goodbye. See you soon. Why is it going so fast? Why is it going so fast? Why is it going
[9350.51s -> 9354.67s]  so fast? Why is it going so fast? Oh, I thought it was about to count. I thought it was counting
[9354.67s -> 9368.46s]  down. Did you see that? That was like a five second timer. That was weird. Maybe you guys
[9368.46s -> 9376.50s]  didn't see it on your end. Maybe I saw it on my end. I'll see you later. Get this rate to 8k. Come
[9376.50s -> 9397.01s]  on. Get this rate to 8k. Come on. No, I'm good. Just 8k. Come on. I'm not clicking it till you do
[9397.01s -> 9412.45s]  it. Don't embarrass him. Don't embarrass me. All right. Goodbye guys. See you soon. Take care
[9412.45s -> 9414.05s]  of yourselves. Goodbye.
