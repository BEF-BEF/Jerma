[1.72s -> 14.57s]  Hey, what's happening? We are all set up. Sometimes Terraria just takes a while to get it right,
[14.57s -> 26.58s]  but we're good. Welcome everybody. Currently in the game, but not... Let's see if we can see if
[26.58s -> 40.39s]  he's ready. Is he ready? Nobody heard you do that. Quick, do that funny thing you just did again,
[40.39s -> 45.35s]  because nobody heard you do it. Um, has anyone ever heard me do this before? Ever? Hello? Hello?
[46.31s -> 50.07s]  What did you call me? I was kind of glad that I didn't, I didn't have it muted, you know what
[50.07s -> 56.87s]  I mean? I had you muted, so I was kind of happy about that. Honestly, um, I think what you should
[56.87s -> 68.50s]  do is like just mute me now. Mute you now, okay? You're muted? What? I don't understand, what's this
[68.50s -> 72.78s]  joke? It's like... I thought he was gonna do... I thought he was gonna do... I thought you're gonna
[72.78s -> 76.30s]  do like a funny thing when I muted you. I thought you were gonna like somehow... I thought you were
[76.30s -> 82.22s]  gonna come through the game audio. The joke is that you'll finally get a week off where you don't
[82.22s -> 88.49s]  have to talk to me. I thought the joke was Terraria has in-game VoIP, and I'm gonna talk to you in
[88.49s -> 96.70s]  there now. That would be pretty funny, but it doesn't. All right, so if you didn't... if you
[96.70s -> 101.38s]  weren't here last time we played this, you probably noticed... Or the time before that.
[101.38s -> 108.98s]  Or the time before that. Or any of those times. Um, everybody in here is dead. He did this thing,
[108.98s -> 113.38s]  he did this fucked up thing at the end of the stream where he accidentally summoned like a clam
[114.26s -> 120.34s]  I mean it was a hilarious final episode to last week's season. So if I'm you, I watch that and I
[120.34s -> 127.18s]  catch you up. We're on episode 74 right now, I think? Mm-hmm. Of the Terraria let's play.
[128.06s -> 131.98s]  The thing is people start appearing like this guy appeared on the roof. Sometimes they might appear
[131.98s -> 137.02s]  in the lava and just die again though. Oh really? That's a possibility. Yeah, that happens. Do we
[137.02s -> 141.50s]  should we fill that space or something? No, see, because all the bunny rabbits are walking into it.
[142.22s -> 146.86s]  So they really are. It's a bunny rabbit death machine and that's important to have. But there's
[146.86s -> 153.98s]  nothing we can do about this. No. We can't just put a platform here and they won't walk into it?
[153.98s -> 160.82s]  Don't don't do it. Because when it's night time and there's enemies out here and they're walking
[160.82s -> 167.91s]  the lava you're gonna be happy then. No, don't do it squirrel. Cute squirrels. Don't do it. Don't.
[169.75s -> 178.25s]  Don't do it, please. He's gonna do it. I'm trying to scare him away. See? He's like,
[178.25s -> 188.55s]  I'm smart. I'm a squirrel. You saved a life. Okay, so what was the last thing we did?
[190.12s -> 197.46s]  The last? We've killed one mechanical boss which are the first bosses after normal mode.
[198.66s -> 204.90s]  Okay, yeah I remember the mechanical skeleton guy. We have to get some of the new ore that's in the
[204.90s -> 215.43s]  world. There's a lot of things to do. Okay. You can gather ore if you want. Like what do you
[215.43s -> 219.86s]  want to do? What's your fantasy right now? I like to fight the bosses. That's the most fun.
[219.86s -> 228.15s]  Okay. I have to look up how we craft the new mechanical boss. Light of the ebon hammer.
[229.24s -> 235.72s]  Is this bad? It looks pretty bad. There was a copper axe that I finally I just saw in the
[235.72s -> 241.08s]  storage. There's a lot of dumpsters laying around. Is there anybody we can even sell to?
[242.04s -> 254.06s]  The girl on the right. Why are they, how come they're not in their houses? Because when they
[254.06s -> 259.26s]  appear they show up. They like walk here. You know it's all cinematic, but because our houses
[259.26s -> 263.74s]  are prisons they can't walk into their room. So if we, actually I don't know how multiplayer
[263.74s -> 267.74s]  does it, but usually if you like leave the area and come back later they'll just be in their house.
[267.82s -> 278.39s]  Huh, okay. All right, well you want to go collect some ore? Collect some ore? Yeah. Sure,
[278.39s -> 288.74s]  because we absolutely need a Mithrai Anvil. Or a Mithrai Anvil? Mithril. Okay, let's go down our
[288.74s -> 295.19s]  tube. Down the tube. I need to get you a pickaxe that works. I still have that shitty one from
[295.19s -> 307.56s]  earlier. Yeah, you can't mine these ores. So, should I even come down with you? Yeah,
[307.56s -> 312.04s]  it'll be, you know. If I can't mine anything I might as well just tell like a funny story
[312.04s -> 315.56s]  to my chat. Oh yeah, tell a funny story to your chat while I play Terraria for you.
[316.92s -> 322.92s]  All right, wait, wait, wait. Party up. Red team. Red team. Red team, party up.
[323.40s -> 339.96s]  Oh, what's this thing? How do you do that? You right click on it. Oh, cool. How do I get out?
[342.84s -> 350.12s]  Is it R? E? R, okay. You're dying. Be careful of dying. I'll be all right. Things hurt. I like
[350.12s -> 357.13s]  don't remember what my items do or like I don't have much of memory. Well, it has, it is a weak
[357.13s -> 366.87s]  angel statue. I'm gonna get that. I want the rope just in case I need that. So, what is the
[366.87s -> 376.78s]  ore that we want? What is it called? Well, actually we need to go deeper. Holy shit.
[379.03s -> 384.97s]  It stops right here. You didn't build the rest of the roller coaster. I didn't build this.
[386.06s -> 394.94s]  They just here underground. Oh, that's cool. We need Mithril. You ever heard of Mithril before?
[394.94s -> 403.21s]  I'd say it's Mithril. M-I-T-H-R-I. What does it look like? What color is it?
[405.16s -> 416.25s]  It's much lower than this. Come back to the the helivator. Oh, okay. That was part of the wall.
[417.90s -> 424.01s]  He lied about the story. No, I said if I don't play, then I'll tell the funny story.
[424.81s -> 426.81s]  Oh, look, let me just tell you something.
[432.54s -> 437.90s]  This is one of the things we need. Is that Mithril? Oh, shit. I can't even get it. He hates that,
[437.90s -> 446.42s]  by the way. He fucking despises that. The I'm shaking the ice in my coffee around the circle
[446.42s -> 452.58s]  thing is like I may as well be like grabbing his ears and screaming at him. It's awful. It's so
[452.58s -> 457.70s]  loud. Are you saying like, oh, ha ha, he hates it. Everyone hates it. You guys hate that?
[459.06s -> 462.52s]  Anybody in here hate that? Do it again for a test. Anyone who wasn't paying attention.
[462.52s -> 469.64s]  Who hates that? Nobody. No, no, not really. Not really. I like that sound. I like it. No,
[469.64s -> 475.78s]  no, I'm not seeing any yes. I'm sorry. I think you're just being outvoted here.
[477.53s -> 482.25s]  Outvoted? I thought you said we had to go down further. Not like where? I was wrong. We need
[482.57s -> 489.85s]  to get palladium first. Palladium. Yeah, I'm just I'm right here. You see this orange looking shit.
[489.85s -> 497.94s]  That orange stuff. That stuff is palladium palladium palladium. Yeah, make a joke quick.
[498.66s -> 502.18s]  I thought you were quicker than this. Make a joke. I don't even make a joke right now.
[502.18s -> 508.58s]  What is this? This is this is this is the terrible terraria tatterdates. Okay. Why are they terrible?
[509.54s -> 514.71s]  Oh, shit. I did just say terrible. Didn't I? You did. Is it because it's with me?
[519.56s -> 527.75s]  No, I like terraria. Is it fun? We're just gonna beat the game. What are you doing?
[532.47s -> 537.11s]  You keep changing your mind. You keep changing your mind on where you want to go.
[540.71s -> 543.11s]  No, because you're like, oh, we're gonna go deeper. No, we're gonna go here. No,
[543.19s -> 547.27s]  we need this. We need that one. Actually, we need palladium. No, we need we need mithril.
[547.27s -> 553.06s]  Go back down. Go back up. I just want to I'm just you know, hey guys, so I was I was at the
[553.06s -> 557.30s]  Dunkin' Donuts drive-through today. And oh my goodness, could I not believe what I saw.
[557.86s -> 564.33s]  I pull up. I've got a $1 bill in my hand to pay for my small coffee. And what happened? Is that
[564.33s -> 571.46s]  what you want? Is that what you want me to do? Yeah, please finish the story now. Why can't I
[571.46s -> 583.88s]  jump off? All right, here we go. I did it. Oh, fuck. That's a big wheeze. So guys, I'm at Dunkin'
[583.88s -> 592.84s]  Donuts. And I'm at the drive-through. You really want to like set up squad streams, huh? My chat
[592.84s -> 604.89s]  always tells me to do it. And it's I give them what they want. All right. Squad streams. Okay.
[605.61s -> 611.69s]  Stuart wants to squad with you. Except I have accepted. Are you gonna be in a mood the whole
[611.69s -> 619.83s]  time today? This is not my fault. All right. How hard can you wheeze without like getting hurt?
[622.14s -> 626.98s]  I don't know. Like, for instance, like, say something that's like a funny joke.
[628.94s -> 641.06s]  Um, pee pee poo poo. I just hurt my stomach. Yeah, that's gonna hurt me. I don't want to.
[641.06s -> 657.11s]  God damn it. I'm actually I hurt myself. I really just did. I like hurt myself. God damn it. I
[657.11s -> 665.22s]  didn't even tweet this stream up. Oh, no. You've been really messed up. Is that the title of your
[665.22s -> 671.16s]  stream too? Terrible Carrara? No, it's called chunky soup stream. What is it? What does that mean?
[671.16s -> 689.27s]  That's it. It's gonna be a long one. It's gonna be a chunky one. Okay, let me tweet this. I'll get
[689.27s -> 694.65s]  back to you in like 10 minutes. I still don't have a magic mirror. I'm leaning back right now to
[694.65s -> 700.01s]  stretch out like my stomach muscles that I just like ripped in half. Okay. All right. So just keep
[700.01s -> 707.21s]  playing. Just make sure just get that that the P or whatever it was. Okay, I'll do everything.
[712.66s -> 717.66s]  But I don't have a thing. I don't have the returno cone. The mirror? Did I get didn't I
[717.66s -> 725.53s]  give that to you last week? I gave it back to you. So do I have it? Let me see. Well, I'm like away
[725.53s -> 734.89s]  from the I'm away from my keyboard right now. Oh, all right. All right. Do I have it? I do. You want
[734.89s -> 743.67s]  it? Uh, should I give it to you? Is this a sign that you're giving up? No, but I mean, you said
[743.67s -> 749.59s]  you here take it. No, no, I'm gonna I'm gonna throw it into this abyss right now. You better
[749.59s -> 759.88s]  catch it. Don't. Will it break if it hits the ground? It'll explode. No, worldwide. Here. How
[759.88s -> 766.63s]  do I throw this to? I don't know. I've never played this game before. Is it not right? Oh,
[766.63s -> 773.34s]  no, no, no, no, no. Okay, I got it. I got it. So I'm gonna keep looking for that or the harm.
[773.34s -> 779.35s]  I'm looking for the orange or or the other one, right? I'll see what I can only the orange right
[779.35s -> 788.50s]  now. Okay. Only the orange. Only the orange or what's that? Chad, you gotta help me out here to
[789.46s -> 794.12s]  get the ice hearts. People are saying get the ice hearts. Rune stones. We need those.
[796.20s -> 803.34s]  Uh, no, we don't. We don't. Oh, right. Didn't you tell me don't ever listen to anybody in chat
[803.34s -> 808.94s]  for this game? I mean, you can yell at me for that. It's just that there's a decent probability
[808.94s -> 816.06s]  they'll be wrong or they're really gonna ruin your single player learning experience by spoiling you.
[816.94s -> 823.56s]  You know, I'm looking for this. Oh, shit. I'm popping a spelunker so we can find this.
[827.26s -> 833.03s]  Is it in a certain? Is this the biome that it spawns in? It's just everywhere underground.
[833.83s -> 844.44s]  Assuming you've been down here. Usually not. Oh, not a not that deep. Don't go down to hell,
[844.44s -> 860.07s]  you know? No, I'm not in hell right now. No, I'm not right. I am. What the fuck is going on?
[860.07s -> 874.92s]  You stop doing that. I'm trying to. Uh, I don't think it's sitting down here. So this is to get
[874.92s -> 880.76s]  a better pickaxes, right? What you were saying? Uh, yeah. Well, no, it's to get a better pickaxe
[880.76s -> 890.95s]  to get me me thrill to get a me thrill. Yeah. Anvil, which you need to craft like basically
[890.95s -> 894.87s]  everything. Thanks for thanks for not streaming on my birthday yesterday. I appreciate it.
[896.07s -> 901.90s]  Happy birthday. You can't say happy birthday birthday was yesterday. He missed it. Well,
[901.90s -> 905.18s]  you don't know that I could be like in Australia. I could be like a full day ahead of you in time
[905.18s -> 921.45s]  zone. So you missed it by two days. I was going to just do a huge wheeze again, but I really hurt
[921.45s -> 936.70s]  myself last time. So I'm not doing that again. It's the stuff I probably have close to enough
[936.70s -> 945.27s]  already. How much do we need? Not much. Just need enough to make a pickaxe so that we can get the
[945.27s -> 963.58s]  better words. They say go to hell. What would you do? I didn't do anything. Oh, you dynamite.
[966.20s -> 970.28s]  I'm so glad this is not like Minecraft where you just drop everything. If everything you die with
[970.28s -> 976.52s]  it just stays on the ground. There is a mode for that. Is there like to play that? Um, I don't
[976.52s -> 984.17s]  think I'd like to play that. I would be very bad at that. And then there's hardcore mode.
[986.23s -> 996.90s]  There's a hardcore terrarium mode. Yeah, that's probably insane. I don't see any over here.
[997.62s -> 1004.55s]  I'm just gonna go up. What is all that shit on the mini map? The top, right? All the gold stuff.
[1008.76s -> 1017.62s]  Is that just sand? Yeah. So it's not up here. It's not up here. I'm gonna go see how much I've got.
[1018.90s -> 1027.78s]  We cannot get that. Okay. Well, did you check up this way? I'm gonna go see how much I've got.
[1027.78s -> 1037.45s]  This is lead. Lead's good. You're doing good. I'm proud of you. After doing that wheeze,
[1037.45s -> 1040.89s]  this is gonna sound kind of weird and gross, but I I'm gonna have diarrhea in like seven hours.
[1041.53s -> 1047.21s]  What? Yeah, like it means doing that wheeze, like just turned all the food in my stomach into
[1047.21s -> 1049.93s]  diarrhea and it'll be then like another eight to 12 hours. It'll be diarrhea.
[1050.89s -> 1064.68s]  I liquefied all the fucking stool in my stomach by wheezing. Okay. Germa, I've got the pickaxe.
[1065.32s -> 1074.17s]  Oh, so that's what chunky means. Oh, oh, oh, whoops. Nevermind. Forget it. Cut me off right now.
[1074.17s -> 1077.21s]  Say anything. Do anything. Cut me off right now. What about Hillary's emails?
[1077.21s -> 1088.63s]  No, worse possible other scenario. Anything else? What is this stuff? Enchanted shard?
[1090.12s -> 1096.73s]  Uh, that's irrelevant. What? It's irrelevant. It took, uh, yeah, sorry, man. You're wasting your
[1096.73s -> 1105.21s]  time. I thought I found something cool. I'm sorry. You said this stuff is easy to find. I don't see
[1105.21s -> 1117.14s]  this shit anywhere. Where are you? It's hitting me. Oh, like the things that we said. Hey, take
[1117.14s -> 1125.72s]  this pickaxe. Hey, Germa. I know. I know. Give it to me. I'll take it. Okay. Now, you know, like
[1125.72s -> 1132.28s]  the pink stuff over here that you see? Yeah. Large palladium pickaxe. Now we can mine the pink stuff.
[1133.48s -> 1139.16s]  Really? Oh, we really need it. Which is going to be lower. Is that like a like,
[1139.16s -> 1144.20s]  is it like a pogchamp moment? Do I have, is diamonds cool? No, no, no, it's not. Okay.
[1145.72s -> 1154.81s]  So now we can get this stuff and that will, I have so much trash. Let me get rid of this, um,
[1158.34s -> 1163.50s]  serpentine, ruby. I feel like all this stuff is good though. Flaming arrow,
[1163.50s -> 1171.06s]  Jester's arrows, granite block. No, that stuff's trash, right? Granite block is trash. Okay.
[1173.94s -> 1178.58s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, is it? Huh? Huh? Huh? What, what, what, what, what, what?
[1181.64s -> 1196.70s]  What? It's gone. Are you, are you lying to me? I think this is a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right.
[1196.70s -> 1204.14s]  So we need to, now we can just find the pine, uh, find the pineapples. Yeah. I can't get over
[1204.14s -> 1209.61s]  the fucking thing that just happened. Okay. So what, the thing at the Dunkin' Donuts? No,
[1209.61s -> 1214.81s]  let me tell you, I'll tell you. Never before have I seen something so funny. Wait, isn't that what
[1214.81s -> 1219.37s]  you always tell for a shitty story? You were in line at Dunkin' Donuts. I've heard this before.
[1219.37s -> 1224.73s]  Yeah. Cause I, you've never finished it. Cause I spend like two thirds of every day at the
[1224.73s -> 1231.80s]  Dunkin' Donuts drive thru. What's wrong with you? I'm a regular, you know. Do they know your drink?
[1231.80s -> 1242.20s]  What's your drink? Lodge. That's just a lodge. That's it. Just send me the cup out the window.
[1242.20s -> 1245.80s]  I just want to pretend to drink it. I'm supposed to, my doctor told me to cut back on caffeine.
[1246.68s -> 1250.15s]  So I still order the coffee, but I just have you give me the empty plastic cup.
[1250.71s -> 1257.21s]  That sounds awesome. Give me the regular. Who the fuck are you?
[1259.05s -> 1267.27s]  That's funny. Angry trifold map? What is that? I have to go back to town and I'm throwing something
[1267.27s -> 1279.86s]  away. Silver ore. Um, all right. I gotta, I gotta disappear for a sec. No, I gave you the, I gave
[1279.94s -> 1289.98s]  you the mirror. He did. I'm just gonna have to follow you down until you decide. No, I'm going
[1289.98s -> 1298.14s]  back up. Just go back to the elevator. Yeah. Screw that. What, what is this? Oh, that's like
[1299.66s -> 1305.34s]  titanium or whatever it is in this world. It just never ends in Terraria. You know,
[1305.34s -> 1310.50s]  you're always just doing something. What have you done so far? I'll take the lodge.
[1310.74s -> 1333.35s]  All right. I'm going to go back to the elevator. Diaper check. What would that even entail? Hey,
[1333.35s -> 1338.63s]  oh, hey, dude. Just catching the stream. Diaper check. Is that implying that I turn the webcam
[1338.63s -> 1346.10s]  on and prove that I have a diaper on? Yeah. Why would you want to know that? Well, no,
[1346.10s -> 1358.63s]  not that you have a diaper on that it's still clean. Oh my God. Like, we know you have one.
[1358.63s -> 1366.63s]  Like, we know you have one. Let's check. All right. Can we have, can we like,
[1367.51s -> 1373.83s]  all right. Welcome to the stream guys. We just started. No more like, like shit diapers and
[1373.83s -> 1378.73s]  like poo poo jokes. PP poo poo? I know you're going to do that like three or four more times,
[1378.73s -> 1383.77s]  but I want to make sure that I put, for the record, I'm not doing them anymore. Okay. Okay.
[1384.73s -> 1392.44s]  I miss the old German and PP poo poo jokes. So I have, right. I'm going to take some wormhole
[1392.44s -> 1407.10s]  potions. How many should I take? Three or two? Two. I miss young German. You can't be young
[1407.10s -> 1413.96s]  forever guys. Don't you understand? I can't wait until you're like 80 years old and you're
[1413.96s -> 1421.19s]  streaming and you're just, I'm not going to do that. You know, that's why it'll be fun to watch.
[1421.19s -> 1429.42s]  I just said that and now everyone's going to freak out. What? No, I knew it. All right. So
[1429.42s -> 1432.54s]  I'm coming back down to you. I'm not going to take a wormhole. Why would I? You're just like
[1432.54s -> 1439.58s]  straight down. Why is there a dino? This is mine? Dying Mountain Dew? What? No, there's like a,
[1439.58s -> 1443.50s]  I have like a dinosaur friend following me. Will he, is he going to die if he hits the ground?
[1445.38s -> 1458.60s]  Hold on. Nope. He didn't die. No, that's bullshit. What? There's a giant clam somewhere again.
[1460.95s -> 1467.77s]  If you fight it. I don't think I want to do that. It seems to cause a lot of problems.
[1471.74s -> 1477.50s]  All right. So where the heck did you go? You went like down. I went left. You know,
[1477.50s -> 1487.45s]  I'm just getting an ore. You know, I'm, I'm contributing. Yeah. German. Yeah. I'm teleporting
[1487.45s -> 1492.92s]  to you. Three, two, one. Just start digging holes. You know, here, you know what? I'm going to give
[1492.92s -> 1498.12s]  you some dynamite. Yeah. Give me some of the bombs, man. Here's a hundred, a hundred dynamite.

[1502.28s -> 1514.34s]  right. Have fun. That's what I'm talking about. Where are they? Right here. All right. All right.
[1514.34s -> 1528.09s]  Let's go. How to occupy an idiot. Couldn't be in a mood today. I'm in a mood every day.
[1528.89s -> 1545.08s]  Glad I don't think that's true. You haven't even complained about it being dark ones yet.
[1545.72s -> 1556.94s]  No, you've changed. All right. I'm going to start firing them down here. Oh, what's this?
[1559.48s -> 1563.32s]  Enchanted shard. No, it's the same thing I got last time instead. It wasn't worth it.
[1564.04s -> 1574.63s]  Yeah. Oh, shit. That's lava. Oh, oh, watch out. What are you doing? What are you doing?
[1575.51s -> 1586.09s]  Oh, what's over here? I think I found something. Good. I did. Do you see these little
[1586.73s -> 1600.38s]  purple pinwheels in the air? Uh-huh. Pick those up. Corrupt mimic. Ow. Is that it? They're going to
[1600.38s -> 1630.97s]  die. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Don't die, dude. Stop. Leave me alone. You can't even see that thing on the
[1630.97s -> 1642.73s]  screen. He's just dumb. How could you even see that? I zoomed my eyes onto it. You see these
[1642.73s -> 1650.97s]  purple pinwheels? The purple pinwheels. The spinning, glowing purple. Up there. Yes. The
[1650.97s -> 1656.73s]  soul of light. The soul of night. I got you. So find those. Any reason why they would drop?
[1657.37s -> 1663.13s]  Oh, killing enemies in this biome drops. You got it. Every enemy around here that's dying
[1663.13s -> 1670.09s]  that you're killing off the screen. I see a farming the stone. They're all dropping. You got it.
[1671.53s -> 1686.50s]  And they're used in like most recipes. Careful. Careful. This is bomb. You ride this fucking dark
[1686.50s -> 1702.02s]  down here. Dude, seriously? Who made the earth this way? Oh, shit. Did that actually get me?
[1704.17s -> 1714.18s]  I'm actually so glad that you're playing as the AFK guy. How did you occupy an idiot?
[1717.06s -> 1719.22s]  Just any time that you have anything to say like that, just say that.
[1720.10s -> 1726.10s]  No, like these things that travel through walls and kill things are the like
[1727.30s -> 1733.75s]  this stage of the game. There's nothing better than another one of those things. These mimics.
[1734.95s -> 1738.63s]  You're an idiot. That's what you want. That's how you want people to treat you. Huh? No,
[1738.63s -> 1744.87s]  no. The joke is that like that says that's like, that's so overdone. That's like leaving the
[1744.87s -> 1749.51s]  fucking steak on the grill for three days and you forgot it was on a joke. It's not a joke.
[1749.51s -> 1753.35s]  That was not the joke. And I think you need a little bit more self-respect. I think I killed
[1753.35s -> 1762.87s]  the mimic. No, there's another one. Oh my fucking God. I'm just like going you deal with that thing.
[1762.87s -> 1771.98s]  I killed the last one. Can we not break this stuff? What's this? He's a better axe.
[1773.82s -> 1778.38s]  I think that's I forget what it's called on this world titanium. Grab that. Grab that stuff in the
[1778.38s -> 1781.02s]  lava. That's down there because there's a lot of random shit in there.
[1784.62s -> 1791.58s]  And then the stuff again down there. Tell me what to do again and see what happens. Go get
[1792.38s -> 1802.87s]  the items in the lava. Now. What happened? What happened? Oh, worm hook.
[1805.43s -> 1815.03s]  I have the kind of stupid gel. I don't know. What is it called? It's the one that it's like the
[1817.51s -> 1829.45s]  right. I can't tell you. I think this one's a little better. I can give it to you if you'd
[1829.45s -> 1832.57s]  like it. Maybe. I mean, I'm just I'm doing what you told me to do. I have a lot of these things.
[1838.06s -> 1842.50s]  He's in one of those moods today. What's that supposed to mean?
[1843.46s -> 1854.20s]  No, actually what you're supposed to say is damn Joe. No, no, no. It's how do I occupy an idiot?
[1863.91s -> 1870.66s]  Dumb. What would my mother think about when you guys say that? I mean, imagine like being my
[1870.66s -> 1876.04s]  mother who watches every one of these streams. Does she? German idiot. German so stupid. He's
[1876.04s -> 1881.61s]  pretending he's so is he pretending to be this dumb who raised him? I've seen that one a lot.
[1881.61s -> 1904.09s]  Who raised him? I found some more that stuff. There's a lot of those down there. Am I gonna
[1904.09s -> 1911.83s]  get hurt by this? Holy shit. That's a lot of stuff. Wow. Wow. Too many too many things. All

[2318.97s -> 2323.37s]  things up and look at them and go ooh. Well, I was about to do that and then you said
[2328.17s -> 2337.64s]  he's in a mood. They really only drop materials to make things.
[2338.36s -> 2342.50s]  I picked up a bunch of shit down there and like oh I really want you to look at it.
[2342.50s -> 2347.26s]  Hey, I'm spawning the boss now. What? Go. I don't even know what I said. I wanted you to look at
[2347.26s -> 2350.78s]  it. When did I say I wanted you to look at it? You just said that I want you to be able to pick
[2350.78s -> 2354.86s]  things up and look at it. That's what you just said. You said right now. I didn't say look at them.
[2355.98s -> 2365.74s]  You said to go ooh ah look at that. What did he all right am I insane or did he not just say I

[2371.74s -> 2377.40s]  about the boss and then you were talking about what happened in the freaking hole. I'm talking
[2377.40s -> 2390.23s]  about both. All right, so that was fun. We have a lot of money. All right, we need souls of light.
[2391.37s -> 2397.88s]  I picked up a bunch of shit though. I'm not even kidding. You know, you know, look at it at your

[2717.59s -> 2725.48s]  I ever had a randomly spawned one what's that tesla defibrillator there are too many items in
[2725.48s -> 2736.04s]  the game I don't know what to do it's too many and you know it's because we're going too fast
[2736.04s -> 2746.47s]  you know if you're playing with yourself take your time you get to enjoy the experience
[2750.63s -> 2756.47s]  but I've ruined it that tends to happen whenever you play a game with start you just
[2756.47s -> 2762.95s]  do the go to 100 immediately but it's also kind of a good thing is if I played this on my own
[2762.95s -> 2766.87s]  stream on my own just hey I'm gonna open up terraria and wait that's what we're going to do
[2766.87s -> 2772.55s]  today there was not only two bosses there would not be any mods I'd probably be at 800 by 600
[2772.55s -> 2779.99s]  resolution and um I I would dig out but still be in my first spelunking mission going down
[2780.55s -> 2782.71s]  I would have picked up like 10 and thought it was cool
[2784.55s -> 2793.00s]  oh wow there's 10 wow what do I do with 10 okay now we're getting going
[2794.04s -> 2803.34s]  how long does this last next week all night yeah I've never seen those vampire essence before
[2803.98s -> 2818.82s]  what's that nothing why is this lady outside vampire essence yeah I've got it too any bosses
[2819.38s -> 2839.29s]  um there's one mini boss I think episode 54 and 55 of the tin arc yeah and I would have okay I'm
[2839.29s -> 2847.08s]  gonna be careful in the title of this I just got fucking air shot by that guy I'm gonna die out
[2847.08s -> 2853.85s]  here you don't even need to be out there just stand by the door indoors and watch them all
[2853.85s -> 2866.23s]  going for a lot of while your stuff kills them also take the warm up um anyways I was gonna say
[2866.23s -> 2872.87s]  what was I gonna say oh yeah the episodes would be titled um something funny and pop culture
[2872.87s -> 2884.33s]  referencing like uh terraria episode 55 the adventures of tin tin with me getting 10 for
[2884.33s -> 2892.65s]  like four episodes oh I see what we're going with this and you don't stop getting 10 till
[2892.65s -> 2906.20s]  you have like 999 okay I understand the minus twos but mine but I didn't that I'm saying that
[2906.20s -> 2915.78s]  that would be a terrible thing to do I love how you guys you all right you guys like give me like
[2915.78s -> 2924.31s]  minus twos and plus twos the stuff that I didn't even do if I think about a bad joke it's minus
[2924.31s -> 2934.70s]  two I can't even it's like I can think about a potential bad piece of humor if I opened up right
[2934.70s -> 2940.94s]  now a recipe book no if I opened up a recipe book and read like how how to make like a like
[2940.94s -> 2947.08s]  how to make the best corn on the cob just the recipe itself would be it would get like a minus
[2947.08s -> 2957.90s]  two wouldn't be me no German listen those are bots on twitch that just show up and spam minus two
[2957.98s -> 2961.34s]  altogether they're all owned by one person and it's an extreme or self-conscious
[2962.30s -> 2963.90s]  your joke was actually really funny
[2977.59s -> 2982.23s]  yeah okay I remember you know like the minus two thing right I was playing Sam and Max a
[2982.23s -> 2987.03s]  couple weeks ago and jokes that Sam was making in the game they were minus twoing me
[2989.75s -> 2995.19s]  that's how far we've gone oh yeah that's what I mean it's like it's not even about you it's just
[2995.19s -> 3003.64s]  it's not even about me anymore I think they thought you made Sam and Max
[3013.78s -> 3023.78s]  it's you didn't make this this is cool see now now I see plus twos but I made that joke I'm not
[3023.78s -> 3030.98s]  getting the plus two they're putting in your channel I know there's a whole lot of you know
[3030.98s -> 3034.58s]  there needs to be like a regulatory board that oversees the like the plus two and minus two
[3034.58s -> 3047.96s]  market because it's highly manipulated okay so what do you want to do you didn't get me like
[3047.96s -> 3056.47s]  broken hero sword I do I'm making archelous do it I don't you know don't you need the thing that I
[3056.47s -> 3073.45s]  threw it uh broken sword right I think I deposited one or two of them somebody said broken hero
[3073.45s -> 3083.64s]  so it drops from moth rom it's the mechanical bosses that drop the broken swords no star is

[3123.03s -> 3130.06s]  uh in this position where somebody who's in the house uh vampires teleporting which is weird
[3130.06s -> 3136.97s]  because normally you have to invite vampires and that is true yeah I don't think this game's
[3137.37s -> 3146.41s]  accurate I feel like everything I pick up is not as good as I have these aliens that go through
[3146.41s -> 3154.23s]  walls and kill everything well you're a summoner and that's that's your whole point I know if you
[3154.23s -> 3160.47s]  want to be a magician you have been doing it wrong I know I'm just I'm just saying stir is smart and
[3160.47s -> 3181.58s]  handsome and funny yeah whatever oh yeah I have this thing too forgot about this thing this is
[3181.58s -> 3188.30s]  this is a very long eclipse moon well I mean it's all night and nicer they're pretty long
[3189.26s -> 3196.76s]  so we just just stay here until they're all until this is over so I'm getting Nancy I mean you can

[3206.09s -> 3209.29s]  if you can even imagine what's going on in my head right now
[3209.29s -> 3213.34s]  oh
[3221.86s -> 3225.94s]  these things are really good too and this is not even a summon this is a sentry
[3228.26s -> 3234.90s]  I'm star boy now oh you actually made it yeah that thing looks pretty insane
[3236.42s -> 3250.79s]  it's melee damage go get him very colorful yeah just brighten everything up
[3251.75s -> 3257.19s]  for her just in case anyone wanted to be able to see what was happening on the screen
[3258.23s -> 3264.79s]  who's the next boss um we have to summon we need the souls of light to get the last mechanical
[3264.79s -> 3273.83s]  boss okay so after this moon is over we're going to go get the mechanical um dust whatever the
[3273.83s -> 3284.81s]  hell the thing is uh light dust I want to make you a hallowed uh staff hallowed staff

[3321.27s -> 3329.93s]  it really not that great though is the eldritch tomb a summoner weapon
[3331.50s -> 3338.46s]  um no I don't think so I think it's just I mean technically it's a summoner weapon but
[3338.46s -> 3346.70s]  it's a material though what can I do with this what can I do with it this is the auger the
[3346.70s -> 3350.62s]  elements very fast average knockback burst of elements the tentacles to spear your enemies
[3350.62s -> 3356.78s]  yeah it's just like a better version of it what does it take tomb of fates and what can I do with
[3356.78s -> 3368.15s]  that how do I get a tomb of fates shadow form hex doll galactica singularity humanite bar all right
[3368.15s -> 3378.98s]  can you please what can I do with that is there a mod list yeah uh if you do exclamation point

[3446.23s -> 3451.67s]  you're on wyvern duty or even right now I think they spawn anyway yeah they're really big long

[3860.36s -> 3869.06s]  come on this is episode one you know that it's too late for that episode one germa starts fresh
[3869.70s -> 3877.40s]  episode one you won't believe what happens and everyone in chat needs to be on their
[3877.40s -> 3885.21s]  best behavior because his mom is watching terraria episode one you won't believe what happens to me
[3885.85s -> 3894.70s]  and I just I cut down like 10 trees what if someone did make that youtube video oh
[3894.78s -> 3898.94s]  terraria episode one you won't believe what happens to me and actually like 20 minutes in
[3900.87s -> 3905.03s]  like something cra- like something flies through his window and there's like bees everywhere in his
[3905.03s -> 3910.55s]  room yeah someone throws a hornet nest in there you would have no idea what happens and it's
[3910.55s -> 3915.43s]  just like oh it's just typical like like a clickbait video yeah I don't know like like a giant ant
[3915.43s -> 3922.38s]  like fights him in his room he starts a fire like his house burns down it's just it's it's
[3922.38s -> 3929.42s]  insane you need to see it must click I'm not clicking that must click terraria episode two
[3930.30s -> 3935.98s]  making my first house click this something crazy happens it's like okay must watch must watch
[3937.40s -> 3943.42s]  top videos of 2019 yeah I get like a giant alien ant comes in breaks through his fucking wall and
[3943.42s -> 3948.62s]  they have a fist fight and he like knocks this fucking thing out it's like an unbelievable thing
[3949.34s -> 3955.66s]  yeah earth's first contact with intelligent life from another planet and no one knows because it
[3955.66s -> 3962.58s]  was posted on youtube yeah as like a terraria video title so if no one ever saw it I'm just
[3962.58s -> 3978.33s]  waiting for these things to spawn hold s to dance are you dancing right now no must watch
[3983.67s -> 3990.01s]  and then episode three it just goes back to normal like he's he just makes like a house
[3990.01s -> 3996.81s]  in terraria in the next episode here we go would you watch the rest of that guy's videos
[3996.81s -> 4002.81s]  absolutely would you skip to the end or are you watching I mean if if this motherfucker knocks
[4002.81s -> 4007.85s]  out an alien on camera like I'm gonna have I'm gonna subscribe to the guy he may have saved us
[4007.85s -> 4030.10s]  all but he's more interested in building his house or he's doomed us all yeah I mean the aliens were
[4030.10s -> 4036.82s]  gonna send back up but they saw the video the main like commander of the alien forces gets
[4036.82s -> 4041.85s]  addicted to his like fucking terraria let's play I really want to see what he does next
[4043.67s -> 4052.04s]  it says I must watch no no he's doing it wrong episode 12 says you won't believe what happens
[4054.98s -> 4066.57s]  I wonder if he killed another one of our alien commanders you're doing it wrong
[4071.16s -> 4087.32s]  you're doing it wrong I mean he's the alien he would know oh god am I dead tranquility element
[4094.73s -> 4116.01s]  come on spawn spawn I don't understand we we were on our way to conquer earth but for some reason
[4116.01s -> 4129.54s]  I got really obsessed with this 10-hour ayaya video we can't invade anymore this is quality
[4129.54s -> 4135.40s]  yeah we were gonna kill them all and use their brains for fuel but not when they come up with
[4135.40s -> 4150.90s]  stuff like this oh no they do this what have you done I'm having a great time right now
[4150.90s -> 4158.81s]  I'm just defending earth from the aliens I uh I don't know how to find what I'm looking for
[4158.81s -> 4167.37s]  I do have like fucking 22 of these things earth elemental is that you or me that's me there's so
[4167.37s -> 4176.38s]  many emotes for that is there uh look I'm gonna be honest with you guys I just don't get it I don't
[4176.38s -> 4204.20s]  get it who's your favorite anime character um Edward Elric why is that funny because I don't
[4204.20s -> 4218.33s]  like care it's the only one he's seen I feel like you should care that's because he it's because
[4218.33s -> 4238.92s]  he's short I'm gonna go up higher no I'm gonna go this way I'm gonna go that way I'm gonna probably
[4238.92s -> 4244.58s]  have like 30 to 50 of these things so hopefully I'm supposed to actually collect these and this
[4244.58s -> 4253.48s]  isn't some big like debate uh I mean you have enough I have enough yeah okay I think you might
[4253.48s -> 4264.31s]  need to help me do something I fell off the platform what do you need uh I'm trying to find
[4265.03s -> 4274.55s]  a specific underground biome I gotta say I'm having some trouble uh locating it okay what
[4274.63s -> 4286.97s]  do you want me to do about this uh help me locate it no wait hold on oh no I wanted to catch it
[4286.97s -> 4295.19s]  no why fuck I'm busy I love ducks that just made me so sad okay um I'm coming to you
[4295.99s -> 4307.00s]  no you know the point the point is to not come to me because we're both exploring the same spot
[4307.00s -> 4314.76s]  no I was just doing I was grinding um for those um flight emblems whatever the hell
[4314.76s -> 4321.56s]  it the bowls of the flight emblems the flight um gift of flight now that's a youtube video
[4321.56s -> 4334.47s]  that I don't need it um okay soul of flight oh you've been getting souls how many do you have
[4334.47s -> 4344.04s]  a 40 oh we only need it like 20 well we got plenty they're in the deposit box hey go to the
[4344.04s -> 4350.20s]  craftman crash show him the soul of flight you got it and check out find a wing that you think you
[4350.20s -> 4356.84s]  can create I think we have dragon scales we have we have some other feathers dragon blast but yeah
[4356.84s -> 4363.56s]  we're gonna we're gonna make wings dude angel wings demon wings fairy wings harpy wings
[4363.56s -> 4369.64s]  butterfly wings bone wing flame wing frozen wings I feel like I've had buffalo wild wings right now
[4370.52s -> 4374.44s]  you are this is a this is a list of like how hot they are and have like the different seasonings
[4374.44s -> 4384.42s]  that are on them yeah okay bee wings I've got this hitter and read them all well no just find
[4384.42s -> 4391.06s]  one that you can make based like okay feather soul flight 20 soul of light we have 25 soul light
[4394.87s -> 4399.59s]  no soul of light is what I'm looking for right now demon wings I think are probably the easiest
[4399.59s -> 4407.34s]  demon wings also they need soul of night yeah we have a lot of those so what's the difference
[4407.34s -> 4413.59s]  are they all the same exact thing except all right what about um the ones that we can make
[4413.59s -> 4421.19s]  are basically all the same we have pixie dust because fairy wings are also available uh there's
[4421.19s -> 4430.44s]  like four or five harpy wings I guess the it's just speed flight time yeah demon wings are the
[4430.44s -> 4436.38s]  ones we can make because we need soul of night we need one more soul of flight because uh this
[4436.78s -> 4444.02s]  39 they take 40 what they take it's 20 soul of flight to make one demon wing so you're gonna
[4444.02s -> 4454.42s]  need one too right oh there's a frozen feather in the storage is that what do we need a frozen
[4454.42s -> 4466.44s]  feather can make uh better wings oh shit really better demon wings oh ice okay oh shit yeah so we
[4466.44s -> 4475.37s]  have an ice feather so who wants the frozen wings which which ones which ones do you want
[4475.37s -> 4478.89s]  I was thinking look I'll get like a couple and you get a couple and we'll split them
[4479.77s -> 4484.25s]  rock paper scissors shoot I was gonna get two bone wings uh two frozen wings and then
[4484.25s -> 4487.85s]  if you get the you get the flame wings and the butterfly wings we can you can have some mine
[4488.81s -> 4496.33s]  okay but which one do you actually want whichever one's faster that's the frozen one so I'm just
[4496.33s -> 4511.53s]  gonna make it and give two okay um we don't we don't actually have a frozen feather do we
[4512.17s -> 4518.09s]  what's going on here we have some ice feather um we actually both can have ice wings because
[4518.09s -> 4526.78s]  we have two okay yeah I remembered finding a bunch okay cool so um which which one of
[4526.78s -> 4531.98s]  these special tables do I need to make there we go frozen wings got it I need to find let me get
[4531.98s -> 4541.80s]  one more um the essence of flight essence of kiss no because then you can have it too
[4542.84s -> 4554.62s]  okay I mean whatever you say what are these what is equipped to is this like an accessory um yeah
[4554.62s -> 4559.42s]  it's like a regular accessory slot should I put these on rather than put on the boots or should
[4559.42s -> 4565.24s]  I keep the boots on experiment terma figure out for yourself let's see you know what do you want
[4565.24s -> 4587.14s]  someone can do this first and you can just glide so you'll never die from fall damage ever again
[4588.10s -> 4597.69s]  oh you can't take fall damage while you wear wings wow okay that's cool uh I'll take off the
[4597.69s -> 4610.18s]  bracelet okay yeah that's good yeah I want that mana though that mana all right I'm going to get

[6480.89s -> 6493.42s]  cannon dude now that's on top here dodging right there oh I had it I'm gonna get hit at all I mean
[6493.42s -> 6497.74s]  these wings I think are like way faster than we're supposed to have at this point in the game
[6498.86s -> 6500.78s]  so you should be dodging pretty good
[6509.75s -> 6526.04s]  hallowed bar the twins I'm invisible the biomechanical watchers oh no biomechanical
[6529.50s -> 6534.30s]  the biomechanical watchers of the night originally afraid as security using the
[6534.30s -> 6539.10s]  souls extracted from human eyes these creatures did not belong in this world it's best to be
[6539.10s -> 6546.76s]  rid of them place in your inventory to gain invisibility at night I don't like this because
[6546.76s -> 6562.14s]  I can't see who I am he said he is on drugs hey all right can you can you do me a favor though
[6562.86s -> 6568.06s]  can you confirm with everybody watching right now that this if the if the cameras weren't rolling
[6568.06s -> 6586.09s]  I'd be doing the same shit no he puts on a knack no I know you're bullshitting he's a lot more
[6586.09s -> 6598.79s]  violent off-screen and verbally stop what were they not supposed to know you want me to lie
[6605.35s -> 6617.43s]  you're a liability what are the boss I want we need more hallowed bars how many I think I
[6617.43s -> 6623.06s]  I think I picked up some yeah I know but I want more you want more between us we're probably
[6623.06s -> 6678.47s]  going to use a lot oh it's this fucking thing again I hate this thing
[6689.88s -> 6699.69s]  that thing sucks why would you say that because it's just annoying it just covers the whole
[6699.69s -> 6705.83s]  screen and releases like 30 little ads that shoot lasers in every direction yeah so what
[6705.83s -> 6711.90s]  you're like sad that you can't avoid all those lasers he's still using sans laser in hard mode
[6711.90s -> 6724.41s]  what a casual is that a casual thing to do I want to get you the hallowed scepter thingy but I don't
[6724.41s -> 6730.65s]  I don't know how to oh there it is I have um I have 25 I threw it to you I threw it to you
[6731.45s -> 6738.34s]  it's you have whether you take these then because I don't like take them did you get them okay I
[6738.34s -> 6744.58s]  took them yeah okay 55 magic damage slow speed very weak knockback summons a barrage of enchanted
[6744.58s -> 6756.28s]  swords at the mouse cursor's location 56 versus 55 uh the really good thing about that is you can
[6756.28s -> 6762.20s]  cast it through walls in the ground which also shows you if you want to find uh nice sources
[6762.20s -> 6766.28s]  but also that multi hits like crazy like if we fight that here you know what we're gonna do it
[6766.28s -> 6771.72s]  we're gonna fight that boss again just so you can see how much damage you freaking do
[6774.57s -> 6788.02s]  okay wow because it hits every single segment with all those that is pretty insane
[6790.10s -> 6809.64s]  I just burned all my mana though I hate this thing those hearts everywhere above here I'm
[6809.64s -> 6841.22s]  picking them up I'm just starting attacking you I do look very dangerous this thing is
[6841.22s -> 6846.02s]  oh did you see the deepest meter at the end there is there a meter you're so far behind me
[6848.44s -> 6855.90s]  there's actually an item you can put in your inventory to see your dps but I don't have it
[6855.90s -> 6866.74s]  bad because trash because terrible because awful bad trash terrible bad bad game bad player trash
[6872.86s -> 6877.42s]  um what can I this I really really like this to a point where I want to see what this can be
[6877.42s -> 6884.82s]  turned into I think I think I think we have to kill another is the person is the crafting guy
[6884.82s -> 6895.98s]  dead where's uh Jeffrey I think he's actually dead we need to kill another another I don't
[6895.98s -> 6903.66s]  have enough hollow bars oh no I do I knew it like they had to be so I threw you like 25 yeah yeah
[6903.66s -> 6924.73s]  yeah yeah yeah yeah stop yelling what buy the blue juice from the purple wizard guy makes it
[6924.73s -> 6930.39s]  so you don't run out of mana yeah I actually had potions before we just kind of have a bunch in
[6930.39s -> 6947.75s]  the inventory I'll pick out are we fighting that thing again uh no no okay but is Jeffrey dead is

[9982.79s -> 9987.83s]  not paying attention say it again I mean I need you to pay attention right now yeah well I'm
[9987.83s -> 9993.03s]  explaining to you yes yes yes I'm ready okay so there's a thing called Plantera's bulb it's like
[9993.03s -> 9998.47s]  a little flower that spawns your minions won't auto attack it but when it gets destroyed Plantera
[9998.47s -> 10005.19s]  gets summoned okay don't destroy it when we find it we need to make some room don't destroy
[10005.19s -> 10017.94s]  the shell also keep green dragon scales and any uh turtle shells you find queen bee
[10023.43s -> 10038.55s]  okay certainly have this is just fire right now what do you got anything worth picking up we got
[10038.55s -> 10047.21s]  bee wax stinger drop any honeycomb no I'm looking for honeycomb honey just pink gel
[10048.41s -> 10059.18s]  a piece of shit I never liked her anyway okay so let's keep going down to find the
[10059.98s -> 10087.85s]  Plantera yeah don't real fast I'm looking get that oh yeah we need to get you new armor
[10090.34s -> 10118.09s]  we're saying 10 spider nest and then you kill black recluses until you get enough spider fangs
[10118.89s -> 10124.82s]  oh life fruit what's life fruit do oh that's really good that increases your max health over
[10124.82s -> 10137.72s]  400 it's like the next step really yeah what's that blue for over here is that anything let's see
[10138.68s -> 10159.46s]  demonite now what's that this is a palladium
[10165.05s -> 10178.78s]  so how obvious is this thing is a huge earth um remember the cysts that we destroyed for the
[10178.78s -> 10187.82s]  other boss yeah it's like that okay and also actually even see it on your map really it's a
[10187.82s -> 10195.66s]  uh it'll show up as a plank a pink four by four square pink four by four square there's a chest
[10195.66s -> 10207.06s]  right there oh I can already mine glorified I didn't realize that also actually you stay here
[10207.22s -> 10208.42s]  I'm
[10208.42s -> 10212.90s]  a lonker potion show it and all that and they also show life
[10215.51s -> 10228.39s]  guys can't get over the diaper candy what the fuck is hitting me what is hitting me thorns
[10233.69s -> 10247.69s]  um shotgun I just picked up a shotgun yeah shoot someone you won't you're a little baby
[10247.69s -> 10252.17s]  that was kind of crazy
[10256.98s -> 10261.72s]  there any reason to use the pick over the drill uh the drill is just annoying
[10282.82s -> 10287.54s]  oh we can't even use life fruit yet I think we have to use like going down
[10287.54s -> 10292.98s]  too far or this is like new b biome what's that no just it's like a little guy crap
[10293.78s -> 10322.66s]  oh we're gonna queen bee so need my honeycomb I see honeycomb I see it unless that was something
[10322.66s -> 10332.86s]  else I think I'm out of no room you didn't get any drops from it I think I'm out of space
[10334.22s -> 10339.58s]  I got everything but I did not get honeycomb uh tin ore get out of here
[10350.86s -> 10363.27s]  I have seeds I need that right should I eat the heart now but should I wait
[10363.27s -> 10370.06s]  oh you can't eat it yet wait you need to get 400 health and then there's some other step
[10371.10s -> 10379.94s]  that I'm not I think I know what it is let's throw the bomb it would be really easy to get 400 health
[10379.94s -> 10386.58s]  by the way if you want to go do that while I'm looking for the bulb um where's the best place
[10386.58s -> 10392.98s]  to get that the fire stuff uh so you go down to hell then go left okay you know how there's
[10392.98s -> 10399.50s]  like a ceiling to hell yes they kind of there's five flame hearts that just kind of line the
[10399.50s -> 10407.54s]  ceiling uh I had been left and right and gotten a lot of them so a lot of them are gone but it's
[10407.54s -> 10419.37s]  just above hell very slightly okay so just get down to hell yeah go left though I I got more
[10419.37s -> 10436.54s]  from on the right than I did on the left what's that there's no hearts in here I put the um I put
[10436.54s -> 10451.66s]  that life the the life root it's in the storage is that one oh I found a bulb find blazing hearts
[10451.66s -> 10464.44s]  all right I'll go do that I'm going to hell I wait what you did I just assumed I was at full health
[10465.08s -> 10472.98s]  apparently not I want like some red glows on you know how like you get shot very much appreciate
[10472.98s -> 10479.38s]  that so you're saying get down to hell and then go left and just look for them the ceiling above
[10479.38s -> 10482.98s]  hell so like if you're on the platform you're not going to be able to see it you kind of have
[10482.98s -> 10491.13s]  to check the ceiling they're like very they're like right there let me see what you mean by that
[10491.13s -> 10497.42s]  let's see if I can figure it out because this is hell right I think I'm in there I think I'm
[10497.42s -> 10503.02s]  at hell now right is that not quite the place with all the lava yes at the bottom
[10503.82s -> 10517.26s]  yeah I know but but like is hell very large yeah people say no go further down oh yeah yeah all
[10517.26s -> 10553.30s]  the way at the bottom okay all right so then you say go left um why can't I jump okay I'm good all
[10553.30s -> 10573.48s]  right looking for blazing hearts I'm on it dude I love Edward Elric I just found the philosopher's
[10573.48s -> 10586.62s]  stone did you very cool man that's very cool I just love Eddie I wish that he would come to me
[10587.18s -> 10595.37s]  and show me what it means to be a boy you just like said words you won't even think you just
[10595.37s -> 10607.08s]  said words out loud you didn't it doesn't matter what they were exactly call that word soup oh my
[10607.08s -> 10634.62s]  god Edward L for looking for it what happened you couldn't put the fire out fire oh I can't
[10634.62s -> 10647.48s]  stand on those right all right okay never mind yeah forgot about that yeah maybe next time put
[10647.48s -> 10675.83s]  the fire out all right let's do it again die again this weapon is not fun underground
[10677.91s -> 10681.75s]  don't I can't stand for some reason I just thought they were the same material here
[10682.31s -> 10699.45s]  almost got me again with that little trap door all right do not stand on these it doesn't work
[10699.45s -> 10721.78s]  that way I kind of need to go over here though what is it can I even do anything over here
[10721.78s -> 10746.78s]  I'm gonna go up where's my rope oh yeah oh I should hydrate it by now I haven't drank water
[10746.78s -> 10757.34s]  all day have you really not what's wrong with you yeah I mean I had a little nothing anything
[10757.34s -> 10773.26s]  up in here nothing up in here um it's possible that I got them all I think if we also have
[10773.26s -> 10778.38s]  all stone you can you can craft them I mean there's probably some somewhere but like if you went to a
[10778.38s -> 10783.42s]  different world and it got down to hell really quickly you'd find them immediately is all I'm
[10783.42s -> 10790.47s]  saying a lot of cool things in here yeah we just like went to our own separate servers and like
[10790.47s -> 10797.38s]  didn't play together well there's definitely nothing else here heart statue does that do
[10797.38s -> 10816.18s]  anything some just do things but no just ignore them now anybody see anything I don't see anything
[10849.70s -> 10854.74s]  all right all right nothing but there are some magma blocks up here that I'm gonna get
[10856.92s -> 10863.50s]  like I was just saying if you're desperate just mine health stone like if you really can't find
[10863.50s -> 10875.29s]  anything I'm sure I gotta go further over this way I'm gonna accidentally summon plantara isn't
[10875.29s -> 10884.09s]  that on you not on me yeah what what yeah I can't summon plantara down here I said I I swear I'm
[10884.09s -> 10888.25s]  going to accidentally summon planter and then you were like already got defensive
[10891.21s -> 10898.10s]  don't make me laugh not when there's all lava underneath me it wasn't a joke it was like
[10898.10s -> 10920.55s]  the court recording of what happened this uh magma turtle worth anything
[10924.76s -> 10936.30s]  to a zoo I have no idea what do they look like you'll you'll know when you see it
[10936.30s -> 10940.70s]  it really is like a heart with a I know I know I know right I I'm just being an idiot
[10941.26s -> 10970.10s]  okay what do they look like you got me can't mine this I don't even know why I'm mining
[10970.10s -> 10997.66s]  chlorophyte because I don't think any of us are gonna use it these are really helpful though
[10997.66s -> 11022.78s]  just like peruse an area let's go up I'm thinking up yeah so one heart is 20 health right yeah
[11023.58s -> 11031.26s]  if you found any I just need one more okay I'm at planter's bulb one more we'll do it
[11036.68s -> 11041.53s]  dude diapers lol I'm not saying it
[11046.90s -> 11078.36s]  ow found it got one okay teleport to me now I gotta get it first blazing heart
[11083.94s -> 11090.38s]  teleport to you I need to go back to the base first that's important
[11091.18s -> 11095.42s]  I also found this weird like ribbon candy storium
[11100.97s -> 11119.08s]  all right let's go back where's this diaper thing
[11121.96s -> 11128.20s]  it's a good joke all right so permanently increases life by 10 I thought you said it
[11128.20s -> 11139.62s]  gave me 20 oh I just assumed well I need two more apparently well we can do that after
[11139.70s -> 11149.14s]  I can do that later and again you can craft it with hellstone and we should have the stuff
[11149.14s -> 11156.26s]  to do that I would look into that before you go on another goose chase hellstone brick or hellstone
[11156.26s -> 11179.88s]  like no no not brick right hellstone bars lava bat banner no I thought that was bacon do you
[11179.88s -> 11192.89s]  need uh hermes boots or anything I just put them in the storage no link root seeds trash trash

[11253.94s -> 11263.51s]  I'm gonna finish this and we could probably just start it I think are strong enough
[11265.56s -> 11277.27s]  to not have to worry so this thing is scary uh a little bit this is our up and down safety net so
[11277.27s -> 11283.82s]  kite it up and down rather than across the plank and I need some open space there for my bow to
[11283.82s -> 11292.62s]  even work look diaper check ban the word diaper I end this nightmare ban the word diaper add diaper
[11292.62s -> 11323.88s]  to like the not show up in the chat let's just do it you better be ready I'm ready weird that they
[11323.88s -> 11336.57s]  always go for you
[11341.61s -> 11355.11s]  but I got to the om part that was really not that hard yeah no it's falling oh mo
[11355.19s -> 11365.62s]  oh that was it's oh no with an m apparently a temple key what's that uh temples the next
[11365.62s -> 11370.50s]  thing we have to do that's actually we should do while we're here if your inventory isn't
[11371.30s -> 11377.16s]  uh I just got rid of everything okay well then we need to find the entrance to the temple which
[11377.16s -> 11385.03s]  is that like the bottom right of the jungle usually okay uh do you get anything else
[11385.91s -> 11395.67s]  let's see uh energy core honey block bloom weave bud bomb plantera uh boost item grab range
[11396.31s -> 11402.31s]  rocket living shard temple key quick grenade launcher this thing is insane
[11403.51s -> 11411.34s]  I think it uses a grenade ammo other than that not really I don't think
[11412.14s -> 11428.98s]  oh yeah now illuminate so we're just gonna kind of dig down to stay within this area
[11432.44s -> 11444.94s]  yeah it's like the dungeon but the bricks are like orange that's it right here oh all right
[11444.94s -> 11447.74s]  but we can't dig through it so we have to find the actual front door
[11448.94s -> 11468.79s]  I'm assuming the front door is uh down oh no it's at the top top oh just keep going to the right
[11468.87s -> 11475.85s]  I'm mining this stuff I'll be with you oh this is it right here the door is in lava
[11476.97s -> 11483.78s]  uh there can we do anything about that uh you can take a little bit of damage
[11484.66s -> 11490.92s]  or if you have a lava immunity charm on you I don't how do we open the door you're gonna
[11490.92s -> 11502.06s]  have to dig through the obsidian walk to the lava easy easy oh wait wait wait wait wait wait let's
[11502.06s -> 11520.71s]  do this I threw a grenade down be careful okay grenades don't hurt people don't go down there
[11530.86s -> 11532.86s]  that's like a really bad construction yard
[11534.94s -> 11541.45s]  hey watch out don't go over there yeah we're also gonna have lunch underneath it
[11544.65s -> 11546.97s]  okay you just need to man up and go open the door

[11597.46s -> 11603.86s]  okay the one thing you really need to watch out for down here is there's spikes that shoot
[11603.86s -> 11607.86s]  there's dart traps but also there's these like spike things that drop from the ceiling
[11608.42s -> 11612.10s]  and they bounce up and down and they do a lot more damage than it looks like they do
[11612.10s -> 11619.86s]  got it and then there's a boss one at the bottom how do we how do the traps activate though
[11619.86s -> 11624.50s]  that's the big question for me floor pressure tracks that are very hard to see
[11626.10s -> 11636.28s]  if you like you see those faces on the left wall on the right wall
[11637.32s -> 11642.04s]  these two little blocks these are trapped by the way dude I just I just walked over here in my
[11642.04s -> 11648.68s]  inventory got full again like you know this is insane this is too what do we do with this stuff
[11657.40s -> 11667.16s]  I got 50 100 rockets if you're being used I don't know what I don't know what to do
[11667.16s -> 11673.08s]  you understand go back to the base go back to the base recall put your stuff in the storage then
[11673.08s -> 11681.00s]  wormhole back to me and then we can stop arguing it's insane it's it's too many things to have to
[11681.00s -> 11689.32s]  keep track of um some of the one of these things is really really good though it was a lot of
[11689.32s -> 11702.31s]  damage what was it I was in my inventory magic dagger insanely fast attack speed
[11715.37s -> 11736.79s]  I'm coming what oh god what did I do I press b wins goss after this is it safe to go in here
[11738.30s -> 11746.58s]  what is safe to go in here yeah just be very careful I'm just not touching the ground
[11747.78s -> 11753.64s]  oh see those are the spikes healing things I'm just standing up here
[11754.60s -> 11771.27s]  could you describe what was going on right now to somebody that didn't that doesn't know what's
[11771.27s -> 11778.79s]  going on um we're inside the lizard temple that has been closed for centuries
[11782.33s -> 11786.01s]  and we're we're here to you know stop the prophecy
[11786.65s -> 11797.13s]  mm-hmm as best we can what is this duck quacking song those are the lizards oops
[11801.69s -> 11807.53s]  we're also they drop a very specific item oh no there's chests down here that we need they
[11807.53s -> 11815.62s]  usually have the thing in it I can't open this because I'm already in it yeah I don't have any
[11815.62s -> 11821.46s]  space open that chest and top left there's a power fragment which is what we need to fight the boss
[11822.42s -> 11857.10s]  okay uh power fragment this is lizard power cell yeah I'm gonna make a
[11857.10s -> 11866.92s]  horrified arrows I think we have a lot of that stuff now he doesn't look at chat anymore
[11868.44s -> 11874.36s]  all right I'm gonna be real the last probably 25 times I looked at chat there was probably
[11874.36s -> 11884.06s]  eight messages saying like look at something there was like a diaper comment what what can
[11884.06s -> 11888.78s]  you say your chat loves diapers so that's you should do like a sponsored deal with like a
[11888.78s -> 11896.04s]  diaper company so what are we doing with that altar over there we are clearing the room of
[11896.04s -> 11903.21s]  traps first so just activate all the traps no you have to like actually pickaxe and destroy them off
[11903.21s -> 11936.50s]  the wall oh don't worry you just wait I'm doing it I'll do it I can do it oh look out a spider
[11937.82s -> 11949.27s]  okay so uh this one thing is up here you want the explanation or you want to be surprised um
[11950.23s -> 11957.19s]  go ahead and uh just what should I be aware of uh it's a big rock man big rock this it jumps up
[11957.19s -> 11962.71s]  into the air and tries to land on you the first phase is fairly self-explanatory don't get jumped
[11962.71s -> 11968.87s]  on and then the golem's head pops off and flies around and shoots at you okay I'm ready okay you
[11968.87s -> 11978.41s]  need to go use the solar fragment on that altar for the power cell oh Jesus well he was just gonna
[11978.41s -> 12000.42s]  land here this is this uh the mario 64 guy okay and once we destroy this his head pops off in
[12008.10s -> 12030.42s]  that weapon is pretty terrible for this so what you would be targeting here like what
[12030.42s -> 12036.55s]  should be fucking oh there's a body oh I'm in pain too

[14809.59s -> 14814.07s]  that's all it is and actually yeah we do have one right here I'm pretty sure is that it
[14816.68s -> 14822.52s]  jerma get figure out this tiki armor or go get the fucking spider's shit okay tiki armor who
[14822.52s -> 14838.73s]  sells it who sells the tiki armor tiki guy I know where a spider area is we can just go do it
[14839.77s -> 14847.67s]  no I don't know I want the tiki on them okay they're in it's the witch doctor in the jungle
[14848.31s -> 14857.08s]  you have to build a house in the jungle to get him no we have the witch doctor where he's
[14857.08s -> 14859.88s]  underneath us he's in the reject housing
[14863.75s -> 14871.27s]  where is that right here yeah okay I think I found it
[14879.18s -> 14889.56s]  uh imbuing station mantis cane he only sells this shit if he's living in the jungle
[14890.97s -> 14895.61s]  how do we move this guy in the jungle you have to build a house in the jungle and then there's a
[14895.61s -> 14901.69s]  button that can tell you who to tell someone to live there okay so I just gotta make a square in
[14901.69s -> 14907.29s]  the jungle with a door and then say I want this guy over here yeah let me let me figure out the
[14907.29s -> 14922.36s]  recipe for the um instant house um why do I not have this scary mask increases your minion size
[14922.36s -> 14933.05s]  by 150 percent and 10 more minion damage I don't know get it why didn't you have it
[14933.05s -> 14942.95s]  it's 90 gold all right I'm telling you I'm gonna get this why didn't you have it
[14942.95s -> 14956.54s]  dad didn't even know it existed that's not an excuse I think it is actually okay where's that
[14956.54s -> 14966.70s]  gold there we go I'll take a hundred of it no more than that I'll take a hundred it's fine you only
[14966.70s -> 14971.77s]  need the pigby staff in your inventory they had people saying don't listen to chat they're wrong
[14972.65s -> 14980.47s]  do we have a pigby staff I've never seen one I mean if I found one I would have destroyed it
[14983.56s -> 14994.04s]  one percent fucking melee speed really I have to go reroll this bewitching table we already have
[14994.04s -> 15002.63s]  one of these right uh we can fight plantera again to get it I can get the portable oh shit this isn't
[15002.63s -> 15009.38s]  what I thought it was summons plantera so what we want you want to fight plantera again I mean we
[15009.38s -> 15013.54s]  can do that yeah should I just go find a bulb though it's right here this is 20 gold portable
[15014.34s -> 15021.14s]  oh okay do you want to fight plantera I mean if if all I need is this if if if plantera drops
[15021.14s -> 15030.57s]  the pigby staff that's all I need to go like and buy it whatever he has uh hold on I don't they
[15030.57s -> 15033.21s]  would I don't think this is this is not a jubade I don't think they would do this to me right now
[15033.93s -> 15045.14s]  oh where's the guy that rerolls yeah yeah you need the pigby staff that's so much money to
[15045.14s -> 15058.81s]  reroll this it costs one platinum and 50 gold to buy the armor set is this no so is this this
[15058.81s -> 15065.99s]  this actually I know how sometimes it's like it's an accessory but it's a mask it's it's just and
[15065.99s -> 15078.97s]  it's an it's actually an accessory so I'm gonna have to remove the uh the fear monger all right
[15078.97s -> 15086.73s]  10 million damage minion size let's see how big they are now oh my god this is gonna be obnoxious
[15087.45s -> 15090.89s]  you're not gonna want to know you're not gonna want to need to you're gonna have hate standing
[15090.89s -> 15103.64s]  near me okay yeah so 25 chance to drop from plantera look at how big these are that's it
[15103.64s -> 15109.62s]  there's a there's a summon later that you can get after um after the cultists and you do some other
[15109.62s -> 15116.47s]  stuff that every time you summon it adds to the length of a dragon right so it's just one big
[15116.47s -> 15123.67s]  long dragon depending on how many summons you have it would look pretty funny that big what did I just
[15123.67s -> 15130.73s]  do what'd you just do I don't know I deleted a hunt I deleted 100 fucking coins somehow
[15133.93s -> 15136.01s]  that's pretty good how's that possible what just happened
[15137.29s -> 15146.84s]  you do it again you show me how you do it well I do I think I just oh I made a platinum coin
[15150.09s -> 15154.49s]  oh yeah no platinum is 100 gold oh okay they just like kind of scared the shit out of me all right
[15154.49s -> 15158.47s]  I'm gonna buy the other thing don't throw
[15167.37s -> 15175.16s]  okay wish we fight this then can I have some of it anywhere I just try and do it here you I think
[15175.16s -> 15188.01s]  we have to be in that jungle to fight plantera yeah so I also bring more than one that doesn't
[15188.01s -> 15192.41s]  say that it just says port of bulb doesn't say anything about needing to be anywhere yeah but
[15192.41s -> 15196.97s]  I'm pretty sure you do like I mean are you just gonna trust me or are you just gonna keep like
[15196.97s -> 15206.41s]  why don't we just fight it up here okay summon it here jerma is that oh don't do that everyone's

[15527.83s -> 15536.94s]  and then I'm banned from the server forever that would be such a stupid move no I'm not
[15536.94s -> 15541.90s]  going to do that why is that just that seems to be like the majority general consensus in
[15541.90s -> 15561.37s]  this chat right now is to do that no really no you know what you must do I'm going back down
[15561.37s -> 15576.47s]  here let me guess we have to fight three more of those like undead bees why you have to be mad

[16998.79s -> 17005.27s]  really tricky we're not strong enough for this not okay well why do we do it then because
[17006.23s -> 17012.50s]  when we kill the spaceships the reason why you're digging so far down here I'm stronger than we are
[17012.50s -> 17018.22s]  right now what's the point of this bunker uh because spaceships shoot down laser beams like
[17018.22s -> 17027.37s]  independence day and they can't go this is a just in case or okay zerg potion
[17030.41s -> 17038.18s]  you're thinking about it that's the thing I am you're thinking about it work you just got your

[17056.25s -> 17063.96s]  I would do like battle but zerg was just there is a block of enemies it really is pickling
[17068.33s -> 17073.21s]  um they're coming it takes time invasion doesn't end until you kill them all
[17074.87s -> 17085.50s]  oh I see you oh yeah I do see you over there I mean they're flying around all over
[17085.50s -> 17089.90s]  the place how come where why are they not over here all the invasions like warn you before they
[17089.90s -> 17101.21s]  show up you need to go to spawn they attack the houses no I'd be at spawn they everyone's
[17101.21s -> 17115.19s]  saying we have to be at spawn okay I've seen them not at home here they are oh also you can get the
[17115.19s -> 17118.07s]  OP UFO mount that just lets you fly forever
[17122.58s -> 17129.02s]  so we could be outside of them you find them um okay I'm building another bunker
[17136.52s -> 17142.65s]  oh I just got juggled so bad I have the perfect weapon for this actually
[17144.31s -> 17178.60s]  get off there guys watch out don't get killed um I used it why did you do that they're gonna get in
[17179.56s -> 17182.54s]  they're gonna get in don't let them
[17196.89s -> 17201.98s]  they're in they're in they've breached
[17228.65s -> 17235.69s]  stuff's gonna start to de-spawn isn't it I one of us has to go up there
[17237.62s -> 17242.34s]  one of us has to go up there dude and like get something what are you talking about
[17243.22s -> 17247.30s]  isn't she gonna de-spawn there's gonna be 10 000 things yes there is everyone's saying yes there is
[17247.30s -> 17284.30s]  oh well yeah go get it what my inventory's full I got something thank you can we do it
[17284.30s -> 17295.66s]  oh we are the valiant infantry I love how you very reluctantly joined in
[17296.46s -> 17301.83s]  well the what the correct way to do that would be for you to start and then me to start very
[17301.83s -> 17306.55s]  loudly after you and then somebody else to do it too yeah and then like six more show up
[17307.35s -> 17311.99s]  oh we are the oh oh we are the valiant in inventory tree we're the one
[17314.55s -> 17322.22s]  that's always how it works so what the hell did we just get for doing that
[17322.22s -> 17335.11s]  that's I got the bard triangle shield generator lane electro rebounder martian uniform torso
[17338.44s -> 17350.46s]  no I like the rank code green slime shield drone beacon I gotta start yeah you got everything
[17350.46s -> 17353.10s]  I have to start from the top man this is like too much me to even look at
[17354.28s -> 17362.84s]  healing someone's a shield drone rapidly laser drill I got the same thing is the shield drone
[17362.84s -> 17368.12s]  beacon any good someone's a shield drone to rapidly shield allies shields ally life equal
[17368.12s -> 17384.55s]  to your bones healing up to 25 only one shoulder guardian maybe someone at once wingman fires a
[17384.55s -> 17402.52s]  concentrated laser beam oh man yeah holy shit this thing's awesome yeah aliens get a lot of
[17402.52s -> 17407.74s]  really cool items these are a lot of mana but the thing is great is that the one where you charge
[17407.74s -> 17415.50s]  up it's like it just shoots a beam no it just shoots a rapid just straight line oh there's
[17415.50s -> 17419.66s]  one that charges and then shoots a straight line super beam that's really cool it's kind of like
[17419.66s -> 17423.82s]  the sans eye thing the skeleton thing but it happens immediately and can happen way more often
[17423.82s -> 17437.22s]  it does more damage yeah you can upgrade wingman like 60 times really I have the illuminati weapon
[17437.22s -> 17441.62s]  you know triangles are actually a source of power it's in the shape it's like that's why they use
[17441.62s -> 17456.25s]  the pyramid you need two wing men this thing shoots three of the same time yeah all right
[17456.89s -> 17464.65s]  what about some of this other stuff let me see the shield should i just maybe just use this
[17465.61s -> 17474.73s]  does it count as something and i only have let me see um banners
[17477.00s -> 17487.11s]  i'm gonna get me in trouble if i put this in there there's still a pit
[17487.35s -> 17488.71s]  what are you looking for uh what
[17495.38s -> 17501.13s]  deflect enemy projectiles everything i don't understand
[17503.45s -> 17515.32s]  shield drone i already have one of these but whatever uh cactus leaf desert feather talon
[17515.32s -> 17523.86s]  i don't really know what this is for i don't even want to open the presents i don't care
[17524.74s -> 17531.54s]  all right let's go check out let's see what this shield thing does i don't think it's going to do
[17531.54s -> 17537.24s]  anything unless you actually have bonus healing like you have stat points or items going towards
[17537.24s -> 17543.32s]  that i guess but i don't think it's it's not technically a summon but is it no it's not a
[17543.32s -> 17549.69s]  century either i could i could just have it does it matter do i have zero i can just kind of have
[17549.69s -> 17561.93s]  it here i guess it doesn't matter i guess not it's cute i guess it is just kind of cute what's
[17561.93s -> 17569.54s]  what's the harm uh where it come here let me see oh you're all the way out there i was gonna say
[17569.54s -> 17582.65s]  i forgot why i came this way i had a very good reason i need to start to look i know that for
[17582.65s -> 17592.41s]  you we need to kill the um so that's the cryogen and calamity mod gives you a really crazy century
[17592.41s -> 17596.09s]  uh ability it gives you a whole bunch of really good stuff but mostly that
[17596.89s -> 17608.65s]  all right we should be able to do it though so you want to do that or how do you what's what's
[17608.65s -> 17612.01s]  your uh what's your what's your plan here are you you said that you didn't want to go that long

[17986.17s -> 18007.14s]  a little tricky platforms or anything uh i do not i do not we should be fine nice water
[18007.30s -> 18018.89s]  fall thanks whoa what did you summon this yeah okay it's a lot stronger than i thought it would be
[18020.33s -> 18029.88s]  this is like end game level shit at least in terms of damage it deals if it hits you
[18034.58s -> 18038.50s]  he's really fast poison too
[18038.50s -> 18044.87s]  too
[18070.98s -> 18080.26s]  38% though that's not terrible yeah i mean pretty good it's just oh shit he didn't go away
[18080.26s -> 18115.19s]  he's still there let's go ah damn it unfortunate any good food in here what would it be under
[18115.75s -> 18123.90s]  we're like the burgers somebody has like a burger right the cook is to the right i want just like
[18123.90s -> 18131.69s]  the meatiest food yeah i think we would beat it if we actually potioned i mean i i like panic
[18131.69s -> 18142.46s]  potions but it wasn't very good um cook i don't see a cook he's outside of our base in a random
[18142.46s -> 18152.10s]  house why is he down here i don't know some people just end up out there all right let's see
[18154.42s -> 18174.02s]  steamed carrots full for 45 seconds increase knockback increase magic damage movement speed
[18175.16s -> 18195.62s]  life regen here we go apple pie so when i want um juice head off dude you want to try that again
[18196.58s -> 18203.22s]  yeah i need to make another something this time i think i'm gonna go with the other um
[18203.22s -> 18213.38s]  summon for this i forgot how i made it that's the problem is that they're on the ground
[18214.50s -> 18226.33s]  and a lot of the best like hardest bosses are flying around yeah the ice claspers definitely
[18226.33s -> 18245.99s]  better for this i have to de-summon you guys okay i have my ice claspers they should be much better
[18246.95s -> 18256.66s]  uh am i blind i should have it what is this altar that's over here i'm gonna use this as well
[18256.66s -> 18260.18s]  it feels like it's better than aiming with this because it flies around so fast
[18261.06s -> 18272.90s]  are we just going back to where we were yeah i'm trying to figure out oh i need lead bars that's
[18272.90s -> 18290.44s]  kind of random oh no i have them i run to a tree stop what would i give terraria out of 10 obsidian
[18291.77s -> 18307.43s]  um i don't know a four i'm getting generous all right that went too far i have no obsidian
[18308.07s -> 18322.58s]  no and we have none um i don't like it eight and a half seven eight point four eight point eight
[18322.58s -> 18339.82s]  eight point four maybe eight point four i'm sticking with that one right now eight point
[18339.82s -> 18360.06s]  four omega lull what that's pretty that's good all right what would you give it you are like
[18360.06s -> 18374.07s]  mr terraria what would you give terraria um 10 that's a lie no it's not you're not going to give
[18374.07s -> 18381.61s]  this game 10 i know that's perfect why wouldn't i give this game a 10 because i i know that you're
[18381.69s -> 18384.73s]  just being like facetious i'm not
[18390.66s -> 18398.26s]  what is a better craft them up game that terraria doesn't deserve the 10 because it's the best one
[18398.26s -> 18403.06s]  yeah but you take you to 10 for a certain category or i'm talking like overall like how you feel
[18403.06s -> 18408.26s]  about the game not just just because this is a better crafting game than day z doesn't mean
[18408.26s -> 18413.54s]  that it's in every single other one i think that's enough to be like you know what something has to
[18413.54s -> 18422.15s]  define what a 10 is and i think terraria sets the bar in my opinion for the type of game that i like
[18422.15s -> 18430.79s]  what's a game that's six out of ten days gone i'm sorry i'm sorry you're disappointed that i like
[18430.79s -> 18442.94s]  things i really let you down days gone might be like a five eight what's a better craft them up
[18444.06s -> 18444.38s]  uh
[18462.89s -> 18472.23s]  are you over there i'm just trying to think something star forge no
[18475.59s -> 18481.27s]  you're fucking kidding me well i mean i didn't go that i didn't like it just go that far but
[18481.27s -> 18496.20s]  i tore this is i played star forge for like an hour um i don't know i guess there's not i guess
[18496.20s -> 18505.06s]  there isn't like a better crafting adventure fighter kind of i mean minecraft do you see what
[18505.06s -> 18510.10s]  this is doing yes what it's doing it's going to do that all the time and it's not giving me any
[18510.10s -> 18519.00s]  shield it's just going to annoy you it's like putting zeros over my head i thought those are
[18519.00s -> 18528.90s]  bubbles okay so uh don't use that thing oh wait i needed obsidian that's why i was down there dude
[18528.90s -> 18535.72s]  i got so distracted by that toria question and i found the mushroom biome i mean i do it yeah
[18536.68s -> 18544.57s]  okay overall i think it's like somewhere in the eights but i guess it is like probably like the
[18544.57s -> 18549.77s]  best or one of the better crafting fighting so here's the question because you're doing right
[18549.77s -> 18554.89s]  now what you're doing is the game of the year is an eight out of ten rather than being a ten what
[18554.89s -> 18561.80s]  what would have to happen for the best game of its genre to become a ten well that's a it's
[18561.80s -> 18566.60s]  a very personal question because like what i think is a ten overall you might not think is a ten
[18566.60s -> 18575.19s]  overall well yeah i'm asking you what you think the game is missing uh i don't think it's missing
[18575.19s -> 18581.99s]  anything i think it needs to have things taken away like what i think it's a little too chaotic
[18582.79s -> 18590.89s]  well also remember this is with mods so if you did want what's chaotic oh right well i can't give
[18590.89s -> 18600.57s]  you a real opinion then my opinion is is completely invalid because i i'm playing not i'm not playing
[18600.57s -> 18605.13s]  the real true version of the game you see guys you could learn a lot from germa this is how you
[18605.13s -> 18610.33s]  successfully with an audience manage to not have an opinion about something and upset nobody it's
[18610.33s -> 18618.42s]  very a delicate walk you have to do but he's very talented at it it's hard to say i'm very
[18618.42s -> 18628.14s]  talented what how is that a delicate what i said the game is like an 8.4 that's a very good score
[18629.18s -> 18637.14s]  that what i think the game is over a seven which is like wow a seven is still a fun game
[18637.14s -> 18645.78s]  game i would play a seven i've played plenty of sevens before so have you yeah i'm not
[18645.78s -> 18651.21s]  disagreeing that that an 8.4 is just wondering what the points were being taken off for
[18655.27s -> 18662.87s]  realistically it is probably just how chaotic it can get but then you came in with that little
[18662.87s -> 18669.35s]  rebuttal saying you're playing on mods sir that's why so it's like okay well it's maybe
[18669.35s -> 18684.62s]  it would i guess it would be higher i don't know okay what's a six out of ten for you what is a
[18684.62s -> 18692.54s]  six a ten a six yeah like days gone is was like a of the highest five maybe six maybe that's like
[18692.54s -> 18699.18s]  a six out of ten game well let me let me look at like installed or games yeah that's hard to
[18699.18s -> 18713.11s]  remember like all the remade list of sixes uh sakiro get mad um why do you think i'm gonna
[18713.11s -> 18725.61s]  get mad someone in your chat and someone in my i mean i didn't like sakiro as much as i liked
[18725.61s -> 18730.25s]  bloodborne i thought sakiro was a way way way worse game than bloodborne
[18734.90s -> 18741.54s]  i don't know if i would give sakiro a six get mad i'm not i'm mad i'm not mad at all i'm
[18741.54s -> 18749.85s]  teleporting to you i'm not i'm very calm about this whole conversation okay i am potioning up
[18749.85s -> 18759.77s]  yes so am i i am putting things down i'm ready ready as we can be i guess
[18760.57s -> 18770.33s]  okay i got baited by my own guys they went and attacked something over there
[18773.94s -> 18779.10s]  try to not stand near each other if we're getting hit with the same charges
[18781.10s -> 18788.46s]  oh did he really just wait to do it over there oh my god he's just hit me every time
[18789.26s -> 18793.58s]  he's obnoxious teleport to town if you need to to heal the nurse and teleport on me with
[18793.58s -> 18796.86s]  the i'm
[18800.06s -> 18803.50s]  i'm just gonna live so you can come back i have to put that on a hot key
[18812.50s -> 18825.46s]  his hitbox is so big okay i'm coming are you good yeah come quick
[18832.41s -> 18833.93s]  fucker he already got me
[18842.30s -> 18850.97s]  okay i'm gonna die soon or what
[18859.98s -> 18871.24s]  he's dead oh what did he drop good me i didn't get any oh it's all here
[18875.66s -> 18885.16s]  oh yeah yeah yeah maybe if you weren't so zoomed in you could see the boss better
[18887.11s -> 18893.43s]  the hive 106 range damage launches a variety of rockets that explode into beads
[18894.39s -> 18900.23s]  the worst life regen getting rid of that out of here i think that's all i got
[18906.94s -> 18921.74s]  the hive is a legendary weapon i don't know what ammo it takes probably we can do the eclipse now
[18933.70s -> 18957.94s]  i guess rocket did i go too far blood bloodborne is like a nine nine nine eight nine no
[18958.50s -> 18969.78s]  it's a 9.85 yeah i think so what why can't it be a 10 why is everyone so stingy with the 10s
[18969.78s -> 18976.31s]  because it's 30 fps and they didn't decide for any reason to like upgrade or deported or
[18976.31s -> 18984.34s]  you know put it anywhere else that's a good point it's an attractive well thought out point
[18984.34s -> 18992.71s]  it's really the only thing i'm a very smart guy even on the ps4 pro the summoning alter
[18995.00s -> 19002.14s]  what's a 10 out of 10 game ocarina of time super mario 3d world i mean brothers i mean

[19006.94s -> 19013.58s]  we don't say that again oh my god i'm so sorry that actually we're doing the eclipse that work

[19305.98s -> 19324.28s]  crafting okay he's entitled to that opinion can i give you another unpopular opinion what is this
[19324.28s -> 19330.12s]  like unpopular video game opinions i i think elder scrolls games are not good is that like bad
[19331.08s -> 19341.90s]  um i mean you're wrong and i might i don't know i just i they feel like i don't know
[19343.34s -> 19347.58s]  oblivion was all right i liked oblivion for a little while but like i feel like skyrim just
[19347.58s -> 19355.35s]  didn't just didn't do anything for me at all it's because you're a mod list fuck no no you're not a
[19355.35s -> 19362.23s]  modless fuck modless you deny it no no i um i did a bunch of mods okay were they nude mods
[19363.03s -> 19371.37s]  this is a safe space no they were not nudity mods okay
[19383.18s -> 19394.65s]  he hesitated no listen fallout also is not very good i think bethesda did bethesda seriously just
[19394.65s -> 19402.62s]  like somehow hypnotize everybody to think that they make a good games they make this is this is
[19402.62s -> 19408.30s]  unpopular opinion night it is i'm sorry they make a specific type of game that no one else makes
[19408.86s -> 19412.86s]  fallout new vegas was good it was fun it was interesting it was really entertaining
[19412.86s -> 19418.54s]  right but like fallout 4 i thought was not very good at all fallout 3 was kind of a buggy broken
[19418.54s -> 19422.62s]  mess and all the games were like that too like fallout new vegas was good i really liked fallout
[19422.62s -> 19435.80s]  new vegas oblivion was fun you're asking you say unpopular video game opinions and then you say new
[19435.80s -> 19442.18s]  is the best fallout i'm gonna hit you with fallout 4 was better no no it was not it was not absolutely
[19442.18s -> 19448.02s]  not yeah it was fallout 4 was not better than fallout new vegas no way fallout new vegas was
[19448.02s -> 19454.50s]  a cheap reskin of fallout 4 that used things modders had already made for fallout 4 to make
[19454.50s -> 19460.58s]  new vegas like survival mode that was introduced in vegas was just a mod for fallout 4 i don't
[19460.58s -> 19467.69s]  believe this at all how do you not believe it that those are facts fallout 4 was a action game
[19467.69s -> 19472.65s]  they had a protagonist that just talked and there was no such thing as interesting stuff
[19472.65s -> 19477.85s]  there's no factions no wait wait it was an action game there was a protagonist who talked
[19477.85s -> 19482.01s]  yeah that was that was the worst part about it it wasn't me anymore it was the guy that sounds
[19482.01s -> 19485.45s]  like chris pratt was that it was chris pratt that was the actor that did it apparently
[19488.63s -> 19492.71s]  no there was no like no no no like fun things to crazy things interesting things to do in fallout
[19492.71s -> 19495.59s]  4 is an action game chris pratt is the main character
[19503.75s -> 19507.35s]  fallout 4 is an action that's i i don't i don't consider fallout 4 to be like a
[19508.31s -> 19521.59s]  true full rpg like fallout new vegas what it's a fun yeah it's a fun action game but it's not
[19521.59s -> 19525.83s]  i it's not what i wanted from like my fallout game and it was based in the city of boston
[19525.83s -> 19530.07s]  and we're talking about that's like my favorite place so that gets like two full letter grades
[19530.07s -> 19535.19s]  from me but then i moved to vegas therefore those two letter grades then transition over to vegas
[19535.19s -> 19541.85s]  i was mixing out i was i meant fallout 3 fallout 3 is better than new vegas and new vegas did we
[19541.85s -> 19547.29s]  really just have a full fucking argument and you were in the wrong game yeah i was saying fall they
[19547.29s -> 19552.25s]  made fallout 3 fallout 3 is a better game than new vegas new vegas just introduced all the new
[19552.25s -> 19558.97s]  mechanics in new vegas were just mods like ripped from fallout 4 and from fallout 3 you are arguing
[19558.97s -> 19563.93s]  for the wrong game but i will still say fallout 4 is better than both of them
[19564.89s -> 19571.37s]  what that makes it what do you wait wait wait what hold on a fallout 3 is better than new vegas
[19571.37s -> 19579.69s]  and fallout 4 is the best all right you better be careful someone right now is making like an
[19579.69s -> 19586.65s]  incantation like spell you're gonna get cursed we did fallout 4 streams and people liked them
[19586.65s -> 19590.41s]  and i said you know i'm gonna do new vegas next and i installed new vegas i installed mods and
[19590.41s -> 19595.61s]  i opened it and i was testing it to make sure it worked and that game is fucking garby wait which
[19595.61s -> 19604.42s]  one new vegas you don't like new vegas at all like at all no no really i think the story is better
[19605.38s -> 19608.52s]  but barely and who cares
[19610.76s -> 19619.72s]  uh i i thought new vegas was like very fun and charming he's doing this on purpose
[19620.44s -> 19626.92s]  i'm not that's the thing though unpopular opinion i actually have these opinions that are so wrong
[19626.92s -> 19634.20s]  and there's nothing you can do about it oh my god well i mean i do think that i don't really
[19634.84s -> 19639.24s]  let's put it this way i would not put any of the last 10 to 15 year bethesda games
[19639.80s -> 19643.32s]  in like a top 10 list of best games i've ever played i just don't think i would
[19645.35s -> 19649.59s]  i did enjoy them some of them but i i thought some of them were also pretty not good either
[19650.79s -> 19659.18s]  well i wouldn't put fallout new vegas in like my top five best games top 10 best games i enjoyed
[19659.18s -> 19668.54s]  a couple of their bethesda games and that's all right that's completely fine name the top 10
[19668.54s -> 19677.70s]  super mario rpg diablo 2 the neverhood no sorry let me get that right bloodborne mario rpg
[19679.67s -> 19685.75s]  card crawl um oh my god i'm just kidding oh no i was saying i was saying oh my god
[19685.75s -> 19694.50s]  because the bow i've been using is awful like the modifier on it is awful i didn't quite catch that
[19695.30s -> 19707.13s]  sorcery yeah there you go so what are we are we good to try something else now or what are you
[19707.13s -> 19711.53s]  doing you never got the thing you needed so we're gonna need to do another fuck that's right during

[19729.85s -> 19737.43s]  right yeah bloodborne's on there for me yes right see it is a very good game
[19740.66s -> 19748.30s]  so what was okay what was your big problem with hero um it was just it was way too like over the
[19748.30s -> 19754.86s]  top like heart every change that they made to the dark souls formula to make it new was bad
[19755.66s -> 19763.13s]  it was just flat out bad oh um i thought you're gonna say it was a rhythm game no
[19764.36s -> 19777.27s]  because it was is that your thing no i i'm one of those weirdos that equally hated and equally
[19777.27s -> 19782.52s]  loved sakira at the same time it's so polarizing in my brain remembering how much i loved certain
[19782.52s -> 19796.02s]  areas and how much i hated certain other things i wouldn't put secure at a six though that's just
[19796.02s -> 19808.25s]  like whoa that's a little too far so how many attempts did you do with the last boss before
[19808.25s -> 19815.54s]  you said i don't want to do this ever again i'm curious i gave up before then so for them
[19816.50s -> 19824.04s]  yeah at the boss before the last boss i i think i i did everything up until the final boss and
[19824.04s -> 19828.84s]  had already seen the final boss on like speedrun streams and didn't have the desire to do it
[19831.42s -> 19838.22s]  okay i did play it for a while on one stream but that that one that doesn't count is sakira
[19838.22s -> 19845.94s]  is sakira worse than dark souls 3 uh no dark souls 3 is second place after bloodborne if
[19845.94s -> 19852.39s]  you're counting bloodborne as a souls born game okay so you think so you got you do bloodborne
[19852.39s -> 19860.01s]  dark souls 3 is like your top two and then dark souls 2 dark souls 2 is you think dark souls 2
[19860.01s -> 19867.43s]  is better than dark souls 1 yeah did you play demon souls no it is your problem you have to
[19867.43s -> 19876.42s]  play demon souls bloodborne is number one demon souls number two dark souls one is number three
[19876.42s -> 19883.58s]  three dark souls uh then probably dark souls three sakira dark souls two for me
[19884.46s -> 19889.10s]  sakira way bottom throw it in the trash a bargain bin
[19893.90s -> 19896.62s]  all right come on we the reason why we're sitting around is because we have to wait
[19896.62s -> 19901.26s]  till the next morning yeah we can't do eclipse until morning and i'm just like going through
[19901.26s -> 19907.02s]  recipes and stuff uh there are items that let you skip the morning and stuff like that
[19907.98s -> 19912.46s]  but i don't it's almost i don't or i'm having a nice time talking to my boy
[19913.42s -> 19917.82s]  you would really like demon souls if you liked bloodborne it follows a lot of the same weird
[19917.82s -> 19923.18s]  principles that bloodborne did especially like the hub world stuff i've seen quite a bit of it
[19924.46s -> 19930.94s]  i'm absolutely shocked that they have not done even a like a remake just not even a remake just
[19930.94s -> 19936.14s]  a remaster just ported to oh yeah yeah ps4 with a higher resolution and up to frame rate i don't
[19936.22s -> 19943.27s]  why would they not do that i don't i don't think i'll play it unless they do and even then i've
[19943.27s -> 19949.19s]  seen enough of it and i'm kind of burnt on like too many souls games as is yeah oh dude what about
[19949.19s -> 19959.21s]  elden rain i'll play it look from software has that formula where they do something so interesting
[19959.85s -> 19964.49s]  that they're all worth playing because it's something you know that formula you know it's
[19964.49s -> 19968.89s]  going to at least somewhat follow that really interesting unique formula so it don't matter
[19968.89s -> 19977.64s]  they're all going to be worth trying or at least worth playing ah shit i do need truffle
[19978.60s -> 19982.52s]  i think welcome to the podcast this is called the unpopular opinion podcast
[19983.40s -> 19989.96s]  that is what my you know my friend comes on and uh makes everyone angry for 30 minutes he just says
[19989.96s -> 19994.68s]  everything that you could possibly want i'm sorry i want to agree with while hitting his mic you

[20128.55s -> 20142.52s]  of the bowser laugh from mario 64 that like you want to talk about an unpopular opinion there's
[20142.52s -> 20150.62s]  one if you would take that and slow that down and pitch it down it would be the exact noise that
[20150.62s -> 20167.27s]  the actor made you know why because i'm the actor that did it someone had to say it they say what
[20167.91s -> 20180.41s]  did it shut up shut up shut up like shut up any more uh any more unpopular opinions

[20286.44s -> 20290.20s]  give you a thousand dollars to name the guy right here on the left i would not be able to do it
[20290.92s -> 20299.75s]  i i have no idea i couldn't even guess i'll guess um if i
[20304.55s -> 20308.97s]  finro i don't know erin i thought it was an f

[20324.44s -> 20330.12s]  care i don't know i you made fun of me to a point where i stopped picking up this stupid shit
[20333.64s -> 20338.68s]  and come back to bite me it has you should have just let me kept being a moron and putting
[20338.68s -> 20343.32s]  dirt in the inventory well you know what you did and i needed it all and i used it all and
[20344.04s -> 20355.00s]  down and now jerma has it confirmed no i don't i don't have any mud hey unpopular opinion yeah
[20355.00s -> 20357.16s]  mud sucks i know right it's
[20368.54s -> 20385.54s]  monthron oh it's just melting i just melting oh this thing is ridiculous broken hero shit
[20390.89s -> 20403.46s]  or is it i don't know i don't know how good that is but it looks good you're not melee guy right
[20404.54s -> 20408.30s]  uh no i'm bow guy yeah are you sure you don't want to be melee guy if there was a thing that
[20408.30s -> 20414.54s]  was like 150 space yeah yeah i'm sure my last playthrough i was melee guy i don't want to do
[20414.54s -> 20428.65s]  it again okay yeah you don't want me to get my main in here do you i guess not uh when is uh when
[20428.65s -> 20435.50s]  do we get another uh attack from monthron i don't know i think we have to kill a certain amount of
[20435.50s -> 20450.28s]  guys incoming mom's run how did i even get in here that's isn't even that's impossible for me
[20450.28s -> 20462.41s]  to get in there i didn't that's not even possible to get in there it is it is uh did not drop
[20477.62s -> 20482.10s]  i really hope we get one more monthron if we get one more monthron it might work
[20483.06s -> 20492.34s]  we should because we did it early the warp staff outdated i think it kind of is but it's
[20492.34s -> 20495.94s]  just free to use it's not like it's taking up any extra space or anything
[20497.70s -> 20523.18s]  like it's half two centuries so um you gotta be kidding me there's 27 gold in the ground right at
[20523.18s -> 20539.86s]  the left door what the fuck man what is even in here it's chasing me are you serious dude

[20595.53s -> 20611.22s]  okay honestly like this is should i just look at all this stuff
[20611.86s -> 20615.62s]  i feel like it's just convert to a uh melee guy this is like so much more damage
[20625.08s -> 20635.66s]  how much damage are your ice claspers they're uh 57 58 and how many do you have like seven

[20647.43s -> 20654.10s]  house i'm of the i'm of the unpopular opinion that maybe we should not build our house with
[20654.10s -> 20660.26s]  like a fucking bread cut through the middle of it so they can get in we have just an open this
[20660.26s -> 20668.26s]  whole side here this is teleport to me teleport to me what the fuck what do you mean teleport to me

[20734.01s -> 20745.24s]  dude you need to be able to kill a mini boss it's too much going on did you kill it
[20746.33s -> 20753.03s]  i i never saw it i don't have any bullets and i think the guy who sells wooden arrows is dead
[20754.07s -> 20758.79s]  they just stopped getting in the house shut the doors they can't get in if you shut the
[20758.79s -> 20765.43s]  door oh yeah oh the fucking ring lady just got in oh okay the doors are both closed
[20765.99s -> 20774.60s]  let's test that theory well i mean the uh the sexual like ghost guys can get in yeah that's
[20774.60s -> 20783.72s]  what i'm saying just complaining and normal people that were these guys the like the ring
[20783.72s -> 20790.52s]  braids i'm talking about not like regular zombies your things i have all of them and they know they
[20790.52s -> 20802.23s]  run around in circles six times you just did a movie mobster laugh i don't even know what that

[20828.63s -> 20834.31s]  melee damage hey but i'm saying you have 50 damage times seven five ten ten twenty twenty
[20834.31s -> 20839.19s]  and all the damage bonuses from your equipment five percent five ten times that is it's like 555
[20839.19s -> 20876.17s]  damage okay can you stop whining now yeah right quick to convert i'm gonna sell the um the
[20876.17s -> 20882.74s]  shotgun and stuff what do we the hand cannon like are you gonna none of us gonna use any of
[20882.74s -> 20887.70s]  this shit right what you cut out no one's gonna use any of this shit right we're not gonna use
[20887.70s -> 20897.38s]  like the cannon though dart rifles all this stuff uh likely no dart rifle is material and it's a
[20897.38s -> 20901.46s]  range weapon i'm doing range so like maybe i just tell anything that's just keep it everything
[20901.46s -> 20910.31s]  so yeah why not is it full again no i'm just saying like there's a bunch of just random junk
[20910.31s -> 20919.45s]  in here of stuff that we're not going to use i like this a lot i wish i could i need a sentry
[20920.66s -> 20932.55s]  is there a better sentry thing that i can find yes we need to kill um cryo whatever his name
[20933.27s -> 20940.73s]  boss cryo boss i could tell you the materials we need you can start collecting them okay and
[20940.73s -> 20950.94s]  then we can kill that boss and you'll get a really good sentry cool why are they firing at this
[20950.94s -> 20963.51s]  person thanks to the 50 bucks lefranda 5 000 bits star what do you think somebody that give
[20963.51s -> 20966.63s]  would give 50 fucking dollars what do you think their uh their comment would be
[20967.59s -> 20974.47s]  like no five thousand bits no comment just guess that's what i'm guessing is that there was
[20974.47s -> 21001.22s]  nothing no peepee poo poo oh nice yeah my man well thank you for the fucking huge amount of money
[21001.78s -> 21012.68s]  star gets fucking five percent of every uh dollar on this stream so yeah um you need 50 ice blocks

[21956.50s -> 21963.45s]  look what happens when you leave the bunker it's freaking out
[21963.45s -> 21975.90s]  out no i don't want to fight i don't want to be overstimulated i need to we need to like
[21982.95s -> 22012.58s]  um i'm going back to the bunker yeah we have to exploit the human's weakness the boredom for
[22012.58s -> 22026.95s]  killing us the only way this keeps sending thousands of people their wrists will start
[22027.43s -> 22029.51s]  and that's when we strike with the real weapon
[22047.61s -> 22051.08s]  icebreaker
[22053.24s -> 22089.18s]  i like body itches am i like allergic to this welcome to the meat grinder i i hate the dashes
[22089.18s -> 22102.47s]  in this game there's two senses of there needs to be a dash button too much noise these sounds
[22104.79s -> 22108.79s]  this is actually kind of is fucking with me i'm not gonna lie this is fucking with my head
[22112.74s -> 22117.22s]  i'm doing a few hard blinks you know that's when it gets to the point where you hold on a minute
[22117.22s -> 22145.05s]  we got to slow down i'm going in all right uh where's this last uh it's done there's a meter
[22145.05s -> 22163.26s]  at the bottom right deflects enemy projectiles snowstorm staff fire the snowflake that follows
[22163.26s -> 22179.05s]  the mouse cursor 63 to 60 let's check that out glacial crusher icebreaker laser drill
[22182.81s -> 22190.20s]  oh that's the thing you've been using
[22197.94s -> 22204.54s]  so this does not use mana i can just keep doing no yeah it it uses the thing that appears above
[22204.54s -> 22212.17s]  your head which is bard inspiration no i'm talking about this snowflake i guess it just
[22212.17s -> 22240.20s]  breaks when it hits something oh is that a melee weapon no magic all right star think all right
[22240.20s -> 22243.80s]  think i'm gonna try i think it's time to transition to the other stuff that i was gonna do
[22244.52s -> 22252.07s]  okay i've been sick almost six and a half hours okay i forgive you how close are we to
[22254.76s -> 22258.68s]  uh i'll be very very clear and completely and totally open about this
[22259.32s -> 22264.04s]  that last encounter um just like i need a break
[22265.88s -> 22270.12s]  yeah i understand you've said that a couple times i'm understanding what you're where you're coming
[22270.12s -> 22279.69s]  from i feel like i just got off uh a ride at the carnival you know the ones that like turn you
[22279.69s -> 22289.21s]  upside down i've never been upside down before so now i don't i don't there was this riot called um
[22289.21s -> 22295.98s]  this is right called the zipper you ever ride that the zip now it's this weird it's this
[22295.98s -> 22304.94s]  like 12 of these enclosed uh canisters and they they go on a belt up around in a circle and they
[22304.94s -> 22310.22s]  are independently can move completely in a circle as well so what happens is you it's a room for
[22310.22s -> 22315.50s]  two people in there this thing is on its own independent axis and it's going upside down
[22315.58s -> 22324.20s]  yes we could do this together so that ride sucks so much and has always caused a problem for people
[22324.20s -> 22329.96s]  because at least three or four times a night they have to spray down three or four of those
[22329.96s -> 22338.39s]  cans because somebody puked in it so yeah i feel like i just got off the zipper i really do would
[22338.39s -> 22345.93s]  you like to get back on the zipper we can do it again next week next week you're gonna do the
[22345.93s -> 22355.56s]  zipper uh yeah that's what you you you want to play this sooner than that uh no no no that
[22355.56s -> 22359.72s]  sounds good can you stop shutting this door it's i don't want to why i don't know close doors
[22361.54s -> 22372.94s]  i hate this door i hate this door but yeah um uh this is fun how far are we to getting close to
[22372.94s -> 22377.98s]  the end of the game okay so what happens is you know those things you shouldn't have killed the
[22377.98s -> 22383.34s]  cultist you kill the cultist guy it summons four pillars around the map which are kind of like
[22385.48s -> 22389.72s]  you kill waves of enemies then you can destroy the pillar you have to destroy all four and then
[22389.72s -> 22396.63s]  after you destroy all four the moon lord appears and he's the final boss cool plus all of the other
[22396.63s -> 22402.94s]  bosses that are modded but that's the core game okay so we think we'll be able to get to the end
[22402.94s -> 22407.42s]  of the base game in like the next couple streams maybe two three streams uh the next stream will
[22407.42s -> 22413.98s]  definitely be moon lord i would expect unless we just kind of delay it oh well then we could just
[22413.98s -> 22420.55s]  i don't know i i'm still having fun time yeah like the the stuff immediately after moon lord
[22420.55s -> 22424.87s]  is a lot of fun because that's when you your items start to get ridiculous like moon lord
[22425.51s -> 22431.24s]  even gives you a portal gun which is fun to goof around with so now i realize what you meant really
[22431.24s -> 22434.92s]  wild when you were saying that so now i know what you meant by you kind of have to just pick
[22434.92s -> 22443.77s]  something you want oh melee summoning magic ranged rifles yeah there's so many fucking things in
[22443.77s -> 22447.45s]  this game that you just have you do have to just pick something well by this point you've
[22447.45s -> 22452.17s]  you've also specialized every accessory and equipment choice to be like oh i'm the summon
[22452.17s -> 22455.85s]  guy and if you're like oh i want to switch to melee every accessory has to come off and you need
[22455.85s -> 22468.87s]  to like combine into a million yeah all right well that was fun yeah enjoy the rest of your night
[22469.83s -> 22474.47s]  everybody over in star's side and if everybody people are leaving because they wanted to see
[22474.47s -> 22482.94s]  terraria then we'll see you later moving on to dos for a few hours well we'll see i'm just gonna
[22482.94s -> 22490.06s]  play for like 10 15 minutes like finish this stupid mushroom buy room and stuff okay well
[22490.06s -> 22503.29s]  everyone say bye to star say bye star bye go away
[22503.29s -> 22547.38s]  i can't do it i can't i can't bring myself to do it i can't bring myself to do it because he's like
[22547.38s -> 22552.42s]  not even over here right now and if the whole house was gone when he came back and he wouldn't
[22552.42s -> 22556.66s]  even know and it would be fucking terrible plus when i would have to like beat the game no i'm
[22556.66s -> 22562.50s]  not gonna do that i can't do that like i still have to live here over the next couple of weeks
[22562.50s -> 22570.47s]  i know no that's too far from me i'm not doing it all right let's switch to dos let me go i'm
[22570.47s -> 22579.94s]  gonna go grab the water i'll be right back i'm still here i'm just over there can i like scare
[22579.94s -> 22602.70s]  them no i'm gonna get lost trying to do that i'm just leaving i said i was moving on to dos so
[22602.70s -> 22613.06s]  that's what we're gonna do but that was fun i'll be right back i'm gonna grab a drink just some
[22613.06s -> 22617.78s]  water and i'll come back and we'll do some dos i already have a few queued up that i think might
[22617.78s -> 22622.98s]  be interesting i'm gonna leave the squad stream by the way because why would i still be doing a
[22622.98s -> 22640.14s]  squad stream change the title to games and demos he's bragging about how he could beat you in pvp
[22641.11s -> 22646.71s]  yeah i feel like the terraria pvp is the same thing as diablo 2 pvp where you'd have a sorceress
[22646.71s -> 22651.51s]  with thunderstorm and decked out with like plus 40 skills and when you walked out of the rogue
[22651.51s -> 22655.51s]  encampment you instantly died from the lightning bolt so that's fine it's probably not as it's
[22655.51s -> 22663.83s]  probably pretty imbalanced i'll be right back see you in like two minutes
