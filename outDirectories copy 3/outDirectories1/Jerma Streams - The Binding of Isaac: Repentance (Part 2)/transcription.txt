[18.17s -> 38.73s]  Hello, how's it going? Let me tweet. Isaac late night hogchamp? No, no, no, no, no, no,
[38.73s -> 51.75s]  it's too late for hogchamp. Is there like a sleepy or like slightly excited hogchamp? Like a ooh,
[52.55s -> 65.00s]  is there an ooh, ooh? Oh, that one. Yeah, that one's not bad. It was like, oh, the hands up.
[65.00s -> 80.01s]  Like, here we are. What is that one called? Hypers. Oh, hypers. Okay, okay, okay. All right,
[80.01s -> 117.77s]  give me a second. I'm gonna tweet. Hello. Yeah, I was going to stream tomorrow, but I felt like
[117.77s -> 125.11s]  going right now. A new philosophy on the channel is if I feel like streaming, I'm just going to do
[125.11s -> 132.22s]  it. I could be at energy level of zero or energy level of 10. Whenever I just feel like doing it
[132.22s -> 140.70s]  is when we're going to do it. I was hoping you were going to play this. I've been trying to find
[140.70s -> 150.33s]  a way to play this. Oh, also, this is not on switch. I hooked up the switch and I realized,
[150.81s -> 158.84s]  all right, how many of you? I mean, maybe I'm maybe this is just me. I have the binding of Isaac.
[160.25s -> 167.30s]  I have bought the binding of Isaac more than I bought GTA 5. Remember when GTA 5 came out
[168.02s -> 175.02s]  and then it came out again and came out again and came out again. I had it on across like
[175.02s -> 181.93s]  multiple generations of consoles. I had it on steam. I had it on my switch. I think I even had
[181.93s -> 189.61s]  it on an Xbox and I thought, oh, the switch one that I have is the one with my save file with all
[189.61s -> 193.85s]  of my stuff because my steam one does not have a lot of the repentance stuff on blocked because I
[193.85s -> 198.10s]  didn't really play repentance that much, but I did. I thought I did play it on the switch,
[198.82s -> 207.59s]  but it turns out I don't even own the game on switch. I own up until rebirth, I think on
[207.59s -> 215.19s]  switch. So I'm like, what's going on? Oh shit. It's probably on like an Xbox, like an Xbox one.
[215.19s -> 221.35s]  Oh, I don't know. I don't know where my save file is, but that's the way it is. So what I did
[222.15s -> 230.15s]  and do not, do not think I am a gamer. I got a save file and it's an unlock for everything. It's
[230.15s -> 238.74s]  as if I completed the game a million percent. I just wanted to do some runs and I'm probably
[238.74s -> 245.56s]  going to get destroyed. Cheater, cheater, cheater. Yeah, I know. All right. Let me ask you this.
[245.56s -> 251.26s]  Let's do this right now. Let's do it right now. But I don't know. Nobody. All right.
[251.90s -> 257.48s]  I'm going to veto this poll if I don't like it. Do you want me to start from the very beginning
[257.48s -> 262.92s]  from zero and Isaac, or would you rather let's just go and let's just play and everybody has
[262.92s -> 270.95s]  already seen this a thousand times, right? Like I've played this game. Binding of Isaac is probably
[271.03s -> 277.90s]  my second or third most played game ever. It's probably Team Fortress, Diablo two,
[278.62s -> 285.05s]  Binding of Isaac and maybe Warcraft. I have so much time in this game. Let's just play it. Yeah.
[285.05s -> 299.78s]  Yeah. Fuck it. Whatever. That's the plan. We're just going to hang out and play. I've never seen
[299.78s -> 309.05s]  Binding of Isaac gameplay. Really? Wow. Well, the game's fantastic. No, I've definitely played this
[309.05s -> 313.45s]  more than house flipper for sure. I've played this off stream hundreds and hundreds of times
[313.45s -> 325.29s]  over the course of the last five, 10 years. Can you wait 10 minutes? I need to take a shower.
[329.78s -> 335.19s]  No, I'll give you two. That's not enough to take a shower, but don't worry.
[335.19s -> 344.39s]  We're going to, I'm just going to hang it up. That's pretty windy too. Windy here in Vegas.
[344.95s -> 354.15s]  You might hear it. Are you going to play with funny mods on? Not right now. I think it's more
[354.15s -> 371.72s]  play. I had a dream where you were on a tour of black Mesa from Half-Life and on stream and you
[371.72s -> 386.55s]  got killed by a laser. Stop eating before bed. True. Same. Same. How long am I going to stream
[386.55s -> 394.86s]  for? I don't know. A couple hours, two, three hours. I don't know. Hey, my dog passed away in
[394.86s -> 407.50s]  December. Sorry to hear that. Name was Bud. Oh, RIP Bud. Sorry to hear that. Hey, do you know that
[407.50s -> 415.94s]  you were nominated for streamer of the year? I am aware of that and I, I can't believe it. I'm
[415.94s -> 427.29s]  shocked. I honestly did not expect that at all. And whatever happens, happens. I think that just
[427.29s -> 434.07s]  being on that list is a win. So I'm happy just being on that list. A lot of people did a lot
[434.07s -> 441.42s]  of unbelievable things this year. So yeah, that's, I already see it. That's a win for me already.
[455.99s -> 464.06s]  And also too, I want to just make sure to say, I know that that's a, that's like a big award.
[465.18s -> 474.52s]  Um, just be respectful, right? That, that's a very, that's a very hot award. Um, and win or lose,
[475.40s -> 486.38s]  I'm all right. Don't worry. Just be respectful about it, please. But no, it's, it's, it's,
[486.38s -> 489.74s]  that's awesome. That's fucking crazy. I don't even know what to say. It's hard to even say
[489.74s -> 508.10s]  anything about it, but hell yeah. It's 10 PM, dude. Yeah, it is. I'm going to play some Isaac.
[514.54s -> 518.38s]  Do you, do you call it a cold headache or a brain freeze? Definitely a brain freeze.
[519.02s -> 525.19s]  100% brain freeze. Brain freeze sounds way worse and it feels way worse than a cold headache.
[526.82s -> 531.78s]  Cold headache to me is a headache is something that lasts more than an hour.
[532.68s -> 539.48s]  Brain freeze is instant. It's awful. It's painful. It's a brain freeze. It's a freeze. It's not a
[539.48s -> 545.56s]  headache. Lasts about 10 to 15 seconds. God, I just got the feeling. Did you just feel it?
[547.40s -> 558.06s]  Oh, anytime I think of the word brain freeze, my roof of my mouth hurts. You peaked at among us.
[558.62s -> 566.82s]  Yeah, that's all right. I'm cool with that. That's, that's, I'm all right with that. That's fine.
[567.70s -> 578.02s]  Hey, you know what? If I've peaked at among us, that means I've peaked, right? And hitting a peak
[578.58s -> 585.38s]  is kind of cool. Don't you think? That's pretty cool. Peaking implies that you hit some form
[586.02s -> 599.43s]  of high echelon, doesn't it? Very interesting. Some form of it. He hasn't even begun to peak.
[600.31s -> 604.78s]  But yeah, I don't want to speak too much about the Streamer Awards stuff. I'm
[605.99s -> 614.39s]  just happy to participate and obviously good luck to everybody. It's great. I, I remember being,
[614.39s -> 617.99s]  I was lying in bed when I was looking at the awards and I was like, oh, cool. Like,
[617.99s -> 622.23s]  look at all these nominees. This is really awesome. Oh, the baseball show got nominated.
[622.23s -> 629.45s]  Oh, that's so cool. Baseball. Cool. Streamer event. So that's cool. And then I got to the,
[629.45s -> 634.17s]  and I was like, oh, okay. I won League of their own last year. And I saw the nominees. There's,
[634.17s -> 639.53s]  oh, okay. Cool. Perfect. All right. Cool. There we go. Stream event. All right. I wonder if maybe,
[639.53s -> 647.24s]  maybe I got a chance. Although chest boxing was fucking unbelievable. Right. And then I got to
[647.24s -> 660.38s]  the bottom of the list. I said, oh fuck, I'm on this one. I was like, oh shit. But yeah,
[660.38s -> 671.93s]  that's all I'm going to say about it. Humble Andy. No, I mean, let's be really, really real
[671.93s -> 682.71s]  for a second. I, I don't even know how to explain it, describe it. It's, it's really cool,
[682.71s -> 704.87s]  but it's overwhelming too. Does that make sense? It's incomprehensible. Humble Harry. Oh, I bet
[704.87s -> 715.80s]  they're done with the shower now. Yeah, that's true. Well, look, it's easy. It's, when you look
[715.80s -> 723.27s]  at what a lot of people have been doing on this platform, I'm just glad to celebrate as many
[723.27s -> 728.70s]  people as we can. I think it's really cool. When Cutie decided that this is something that she
[728.70s -> 736.76s]  wanted to do, it's just like, oh, like an award show. That's not like a, it's fan voted and it's
[736.76s -> 741.10s]  a bunch of streamers get together and kind of hang out for, for a night. And it's just cool.
[741.10s -> 750.22s]  It's cool. And being in any of those lists or even being, even being invited to that event is
[750.22s -> 764.68s]  just like, oh shit. Okay, cool. So yeah, that's, that's how I feel. Are you going to wear the same
[764.68s -> 773.82s]  suit? Uh, I was, I have a, I had a specific request. I believe it was, uh, it was Jake.
[774.78s -> 786.20s]  Jake said, wear a different suit this year. I was like, all right, I gotta get, I gotta get like
[786.20s -> 795.96s]  tailored, right? I don't know. I'm gonna show up in fucking tube socks and like a pair of shorts.
[796.52s -> 810.66s]  Wear a tuxedo? No, I cannot pull a tux off. No way. I don't, I don't know if I like the way
[810.66s -> 818.04s]  I look in a tux. I kind of look like a goofball on a tux. All right, let's, uh, let's go.
[818.68s -> 822.84s]  You guys ready? I know people are going to look, people are going to think that I am an
[822.84s -> 830.97s]  unbelievable video game player. And you see this shit. I even, it's hard for me to look at this,
[830.97s -> 837.32s]  right? Ready? Oh, new run. Oh, cool. Yeah. Look at all this. Look, I did all this.
[838.28s -> 850.46s]  I did all of this. I'm very, I'm so good at this game. Oh, also, I want to talk about this for
[850.46s -> 856.79s]  just a second. There's going to be, uh, people have a lot of questions about Grotto Beasts.
[857.78s -> 864.49s]  And as we get closer to being able to really announce the launch, which like I said, is this
[864.49s -> 869.21s]  end of February, this, it's this end of February into the first week of March,
[869.93s -> 877.90s]  is this like this target here. You're going to see a lot of stuff. I think, uh, the Grotto Beasts
[877.90s -> 882.86s]  team is working on an FAQ to help answer a bunch of questions. Obviously I'm going to be talking
[882.86s -> 891.18s]  about a lot. There's some really, really, really cool shit that you'll see eventually here very
[891.18s -> 898.78s]  soon. All right. Some of these characters I've never even heard of. Let's, let's see. I've,
[898.78s -> 908.38s]  I've never played with this character. I don't know who this is. Uh, I'll be honest. I'd say
[908.38s -> 918.94s]  if I played a thousand games of Binding of Isaac, 900 of them were on Cain. Like R1. What is it?
[920.57s -> 929.75s]  What does this mean? What is this? I don't like that. Is that like super mode? Is that insane
[929.75s -> 939.85s]  mode? I don't know what any of this means. Maybe I shouldn't have done this. I don't know what any
[939.93s -> 958.55s]  of this does. It's alternative characters. Oh, this is crazy. Cain is boring. Well, we got to
[958.55s -> 961.59s]  just, let me just get back. Let me get back in the swing of things here. We're going to go Cain
[964.28s -> 971.74s]  in greed mode. Yeah. Cain on greed mode. Just to start. I got to remember how to play the game.
[975.43s -> 986.02s]  I remember a lot about it. This is like one of my favorite games. You picked the wrong one.
[988.06s -> 996.26s]  Look, I'm, I'm a Cain player. Oh, by the way, I also have a cheat sheet open here. That's a good
[996.26s -> 1007.62s]  start. Wait, where's my, where is it? There it is. Okay. There you go. I like looking at that.
[1007.62s -> 1017.67s]  Is it Cain main? Yeah. It hurts. No, it doesn't. Go ahead and get that started. Now let's go cheat
[1017.67s -> 1028.10s]  sheet. It hurts. This is the, okay. Taking damage causes Isaac to fire a circle of 10 tiers around
[1028.10s -> 1039.51s]  him dealing 10 damage. Okay. So when you get hurt, you fire tears. What the fuck is going on? Cheater.
[1041.69s -> 1051.56s]  If you're playing Isaac without a cheat sheet of what items do, you are an encyclopedia. There's a
[1051.56s -> 1058.66s]  good mod that just gives you that cheat sheet info in the game. Oh, that's so perfect. How hard is
[1058.66s -> 1068.46s]  it to get? Is it like, is it like, is it a simple, like two second download? It's like, it's simple.
[1068.46s -> 1076.07s]  It's a steam download. It's a steam mod. It's super simple. Go to the menus and enable it in
[1076.07s -> 1080.34s]  the workshop. Okay. All right. Uh, yeah. I'll do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1080.34s -> 1082.34s]  That's fine. Let's let the, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1082.34s -> 1086.66s]  All right. Give me what I, you know what? Hey, start a stream starting soon. I'll be back in a
[1086.66s -> 1104.25s]  second. What is it called by the way? Does it have a name? What is it called? External item
[1104.25s -> 1123.54s]  descriptions. Steam workshop. Okay. Workshop. It's called. No, it's not. All right. It is
[1123.54s -> 1151.19s]  external item descriptions. Oh, the links like there. How do I open this link in steam? Is it
[1151.19s -> 1176.18s]  just like on the front page? Uh, where's like most popular install the POG mod? Oh, I don't want to
[1176.18s -> 1186.46s]  do a bunch of mods. I don't know. I don't know what they all do. How do I open this in the
[1186.46s -> 1191.94s]  workshop? Okay. It's, it's got like a, here's the name. It's like a, it starts with this.
[1196.89s -> 1214.18s]  All right. There we go. What does rep mean? Rep. R.I.P. Oh, repentance. Okay. Does this,
[1214.18s -> 1224.30s]  does this work for, um, okay. Yeah, it does. There it is. All right. Subscribe.
[1226.87s -> 1258.14s]  It'd be good to go. Right? Right. Mods. External item descriptions. So is it press tab to enable
[1258.14s -> 1278.52s]  mods. That's on now. All right. Sick. Let's go. No, it's off. Is it on? All right. So let's, uh,
[1278.52s -> 1294.57s]  new game. Read. Kane. I've never heard of this before. Okay. Holy shit. That's so good. Imagine
[1294.57s -> 1306.68s]  ever playing this game without this turned on, right? That is life changing. I've had that.
[1307.54s -> 1313.46s]  There's a, there's a few websites. There's like wikis. There's that platinum god and it's always
[1313.46s -> 1322.49s]  you look for the item. I, I've spent a minute, two, three minutes straight looking for the icon.
[1324.09s -> 1335.21s]  Wow. All right. That's unbelievable. Thank you. Appreciate it. POG mod is also fun. Yeah. I
[1335.21s -> 1342.97s]  remember looking through and not being able to find that item in the icon list and just being
[1342.97s -> 1347.69s]  like, Olly, can you, can you use your, can you help me? Can you use my, can you, I need a second
[1347.69s -> 1354.44s]  pair of eyes. All right. Tempers and she's just slowing tears. I wonder if there's a chance. Ooh.
[1354.44s -> 1362.74s]  Okay. All right. This is not a bad start. That's a lot of damage. I only have one heart though.
[1362.74s -> 1373.51s]  Oh, this might be bad. That's so cool. All right. I just gotta go for it. It's been a while. Just
[1373.51s -> 1386.33s]  don't get hit. Just don't get hit. Is it, you know, also I'm going to sit back in my chair
[1386.33s -> 1389.45s]  because I really, I feel like Isaac is the kind of game where I need to sit far away.
[1390.01s -> 1407.77s]  The closer I am, the worse I do. Just don't get hit. So this is, the greedier mode is way harder,
[1407.77s -> 1415.56s]  but we're going to, we're going to start with this first. I remember greedier mode was rage
[1415.56s -> 1433.27s]  inducing sometimes. Greedier sucks. They just give you less money and the boss at the end has
[1433.27s -> 1447.06s]  a second phase and it's awful. But greed is my favorite mode in the game. If you count all the
[1447.06s -> 1456.30s]  hours I've spent in this game, most of them are probably here. Okay. Uh, let's go. It's a horrible
[1456.30s -> 1464.01s]  take. That's fine. I'll be the weirdo that likes this more than anything else. How's auto? Auto's
[1464.01s -> 1475.38s]  good. All right. Do I, I definitely, I need this unfortunately. Ooh, wait, this is a good one.
[1475.38s -> 1484.38s]  That's health and tears up. Oh yeah. Play red dead, undead nightmare. I've been in the middle
[1484.38s -> 1500.81s]  of a burp for five straight seconds. No. Okay. I'm good. Pretty good damage so far.
[1501.53s -> 1526.71s]  Just burp already. Yeah, but sometimes it takes a little while. Oh, four seconds is bad. Oh my
[1526.71s -> 1537.45s]  God. I hate those little things. They, I feel like they take so long to kill. Those things sit at zero
[1537.45s -> 1553.96s]  HP for, it seems like an eternity. The rest of the stuff in here is kind of junk, isn't it?
[1553.96s -> 1569.48s]  Random stat up, random stat down. Yeah, this thing sucks. I need a bomb. This is, this is bad. Look
[1569.48s -> 1576.70s]  at all this money that's left on the table here. That really sucks. This would probably be like
[1576.70s -> 1586.74s]  another 10 cents at least spike room. I'm, I only have two hearts. I'm afraid to go in here,
[1586.74s -> 1598.17s]  but I'm gonna, I'm gonna, whatever. And that's exactly why you go in. That's why you do that.
[1598.17s -> 1603.51s]  Uh, I can't get them both, but I will be able to get them both. Thank you. Is it, is it up? There
[1603.51s -> 1638.26s]  you go. Secret room. HP tears up, shot speed down. What kind of bad, you're going to be pissing up a
[1638.26s -> 1643.32s]  storm later. Sorry to be the, oh, you're not talking to me. All right. I'm going to be,
[1643.32s -> 1647.40s]  is, this is stupid. This is a really bad idea because I would, I should save this for the other
[1647.40s -> 1670.22s]  floor, but I'm going for it. I don't care. Not a bad trade. Uh, Kane's, Kane, I fucked up. Uh,
[1670.22s -> 1681.99s]  Kane starts with a paper clip, which opens up chests. All right. Whoops. Hey, it's all right.
[1681.99s -> 1702.71s]  Worked out. What a fake Kane main. Uh-oh. I got one hit. I haven't played in a while either.
[1702.71s -> 1713.74s]  You guys are going to have to help me when eventually we get to the part where, um, you
[1713.74s -> 1717.98s]  know, it's like, Oh, go down this hallway to get to this secret area, beat that secret area,
[1717.98s -> 1721.42s]  pick up that item and then bring that item to the next area and then go down the hole. And that's
[1721.42s -> 1734.47s]  how you get to delirious, whatever his name is. Cause I have no idea. Uh, I think that's actually
[1734.47s -> 1748.52s]  pretty good for here because I can use it every single, uh, spawn. Yeah. Every time a new wave
[1748.52s -> 1757.56s]  happens, I can do it again. Right? No tinted rocks. Don't miss anything. I have a key. I'm good. I
[1757.56s -> 1763.59s]  could check this wall here, but we're not going to do that. Cause it's a waste. All right, let's go.
[1764.23s -> 1776.78s]  I mean, I'm doing it here. Oh, what am I doing? Oops. Whatever. I could have done. It could have
[1776.78s -> 1796.31s]  been secret room. Just burnt my tongue. Dude. That sucks. Really? Ooh. Ouch. Ouch, man. That sucks.
[1797.03s -> 1812.54s]  What five damage up for each enemy killed in the room. Capsa plus. Oh, that's awesome. Especially
[1812.54s -> 1838.41s]  if you're green speed. Always good. Hmm. Is it? Well, I'm definitely going to get that.
[1838.41s -> 1846.15s]  It's a full day. Look, I have 7.2 damage is actually really good. Am I using a mod? Yep. Uh,
[1847.66s -> 1855.77s]  I just heard about this mod 15 minutes ago. So you open the blocks with the paper clip. Oh,
[1855.77s -> 1868.63s]  you can't unfortunately, but yes, this mod just tells you what everything does. Well,
[1868.63s -> 1876.90s]  I definitely want that first. All right, let's go. Yeah. The whatever Guppy's head is, is pretty
[1876.90s -> 1907.40s]  awesome early game. You just do it every single spawn. What do you mean? Shadow is messing me up
[1907.40s -> 1920.54s]  with a reflection or whatever. Oh, oh, fuck. I'm fine. I'm actually like freaking out right now.
[1927.26s -> 1952.89s]  Oh, all right. We're OK. OK, definitely this. All right. Uh, are the mod friend folio an entire
[1952.89s -> 1960.78s]  community expansion of the game? I lost the damage bonus that I had before. How did I have that?
[1962.38s -> 1972.95s]  How did I have that damage bonus? It was already a 7.2. Am I seeing things? I always got to left
[1972.95s -> 1979.08s]  the room, right? Shit. There we go. I got to I have to be good about that. Well, I had to leave
[1979.08s -> 2004.89s]  the room because if I take one hit, I would be dead. We're good. Build it back up. I'm not going
[2004.89s -> 2030.01s]  to leave. What? This reflective ground sucks. So I'm no screaming. It's fucking like it's late.
[2036.82s -> 2049.34s]  This screwed me up. I didn't die. Somebody said F. No, I didn't. I hate this little thing.
[2049.34s -> 2054.34s]  This thing always kills me. Oh, my God. OK, that was a warm up.
[2056.50s -> 2059.94s]  OK, that's a warm up. That was just warming up. We're just warming up.
[2059.94s -> 2065.48s]  It's all right. Look, we're even going to get the same items. I get the same items.
[2074.36s -> 2093.98s]  Die to fire. I thought I put it out. Oh, that's kind of sad. Booster pack. Oh,
[2093.98s -> 2116.65s]  booster pack. Is it grotto beast? Not yet. Oh, what was that? What's this? What's this? What's
[2116.73s -> 2123.22s]  happening? What is this thing? What does this do? Oh, my God. What does this mean?
[2124.50s -> 2135.78s]  Should I stop freaking out? What does this mean? I've never seen this before. Get it fast.
[2136.34s -> 2141.70s]  Keep freaking out. That's the golden penny. It's a lot of money. It's just keep. No, no, no, no.
[2141.70s -> 2152.28s]  Keep freaking out. Keep freaking out. I'm going to get overwhelmed. I got to kill stuff. Will it
[2152.28s -> 2180.57s]  stay there? Oh, shit. It keeps responding until it stops. Oh, OK. I think it stopped. All right.
[2180.57s -> 2184.94s]  I think it's tough. I've never seen that before. I've never seen that. I think I think I'm going to
[2184.94s -> 2236.87s]  die. You. OK, we're fine. That was crazy. Thirty three coins. Definitely this is the value on this
[2236.87s -> 2246.14s]  good. I feel like this is too random, although I could get the one that doubles the coins.
[2246.14s -> 2258.25s]  Yeah, let's do it. This is just hearts. This is the devil, which is this is double keys.
[2259.88s -> 2274.09s]  Ancient recall, draw three cards. Oh, my God. Death, the sun, the joker. Oh, the hierophant.
[2274.09s -> 2286.54s]  I guess I just double the keys and then double the keys. Right. Is this a way? Did I have to?
[2286.54s -> 2298.09s]  Now, this is the sun. This is. Should I buy a key and then double the keys? I can't. I'm just
[2298.09s -> 2306.49s]  going to do it of speed. It's a free key. And then this is just hearts. So who cares? This is
[2307.48s -> 2319.62s]  damage. Right. But who cares? I hold on to the sun. The sun card is the best one.
[2319.62s -> 2324.30s]  I'm going to hold on to the sun card. The rest of these. I don't think they really do very much.
[2324.30s -> 2331.21s]  Use the joker, the joker. OK, so the joker gives me a free item room. Right. Or is it the secret
[2331.21s -> 2339.43s]  room? Wait, let me read it. It reports Isaac to the devil or. Oh, yeah, but I'm going to do that
[2339.43s -> 2347.91s]  anyways. Just do it for free so I don't have to fight the nightmare thing. I guess that makes
[2347.91s -> 2400.44s]  sense. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Come on. Forgot he did that move.
[2400.44s -> 2436.84s]  My range is awful. Why is my range so bad? Cane. Stinks. I mean, it's good. Yeah. All right. Let's
[2437.48s -> 2445.19s]  now let's go here. Sun cards, the thing to take. Yeah. Then I'm going to open the door.
[2445.19s -> 2457.50s]  Hell is the everything jar. Spawns pickups based on the number of charges. Charge one, two, three,
[2457.50s -> 2475.37s]  four, five. This item is based. That's really, really good. It's active. OK, so how many charges
[2475.37s -> 2489.50s]  should I really wait for then? Yeah, it's per room. Do it between nine charges. Is it gold?
[2490.06s -> 2497.98s]  Depends on what you need. Hold the map button. Oh, that's really cool. OK. Well, there's no reason
[2497.98s -> 2507.43s]  to do it for one. Two is a coin. Three is a bomb for. Wait, what is the. I forget what the gold.
[2507.51s -> 2524.12s]  What is the gold bomb? Infinite bombs, infinite bombs for the whole floor. Oh, my God. OK.
[2525.50s -> 2538.34s]  Do not hold R. Hold the R button to activate POG mod. Oh, good for you. It's too bad you didn't
[2538.34s -> 2545.42s]  say that two minutes ago because I don't have the POG mod installed. That was a good attempt,
[2545.42s -> 2557.56s]  though. I do appreciate the attempt. Let's just go. I'm going to keep the sun. Oh, man.
[2558.20s -> 2563.75s]  You always have to look and see what those are, if it's possible, because if it's the double coins
[2563.75s -> 2584.04s]  one, you win automatically in greed mode. I get a bomb. Use the devil one as a different card.
[2584.04s -> 2593.58s]  It is. Whoa. So I just use it. Oh, my God. I thought I thought the devil car was just damn well.
[2593.58s -> 2598.79s]  That's different. I've never unlocked that. Cool. Good thing I have somebody else's save file.
[2598.79s -> 2611.32s]  Nice. Let's go. Oh, it is. It is. Wait, put it down. Put it down. How do I put it down?
[2611.40s -> 2615.24s]  Hold. How do I put it down? How do I put it down? How do I put it down? How do I put this down?
[2615.24s -> 2623.08s]  You hold a button. It's hold R, isn't it? But I thought I can't. I thought don't hold R,
[2623.08s -> 2638.63s]  though. I thought everyone said don't hold R. R is reset. Oh, OK. We're good. That's what I
[2638.63s -> 2657.98s]  wanted. All right. So now what? What's this one? Shit. I can't take them both. All right. Well,
[2657.98s -> 2666.90s]  I'm keeping it. It was a check. Oh, I thought I could only do it. All right. Sorry. We're good.
[2668.06s -> 2670.78s]  I don't need it. I'm going to be going to be dog shit in there anyways.
[2676.70s -> 2694.58s]  Oh, pretty good. Very good. Now I get to 40. I get to 50 coins and I get 100 coins and then
[2694.58s -> 2708.22s]  we can just go on a complete shopping spree. That's why I love greed mode. Don't buy anything.
[2708.22s -> 2740.95s]  Just just I got to make sure I don't lose all matters. I can't even tell how many charges
[2740.95s -> 2755.75s]  that is. I wish it was just a number because the amount of real estate that you have to looking
[2755.75s -> 2763.13s]  up in the corner of the screen is like death. I pay attention. Just do it when it's over eight.
[2768.54s -> 2782.18s]  Nine. Should I do it now? What's that do? Do it nine always then, because that when that removes it,
[2782.18s -> 2792.09s]  it gives me health. Right. I mean, it gives me money. All right. I'm only shit. OK. I'm good.
[2803.91s -> 2812.06s]  Very cool. Give me some damage up. And this is pretty much a good game.
[2812.62s -> 2824.86s]  Could be at least I think he does the bounce. Yep. Does it again. Sometimes you change it together
[2824.86s -> 2839.46s]  and it's annoying. Forty one. Try to get the habit so you get a charge every time you get hit.
[2847.16s -> 2853.91s]  Take the devil deal. Hold on. I could do it now. Would you be close enough? Right.
[2854.71s -> 2865.62s]  Yeah, I'm going to do it now. Here's up to point. I need the range up and it spawns a lucky penny.
[2870.14s -> 2884.04s]  Nice. I needed that so badly. I want this for random. I don't like these. Let's just do.
[2884.04s -> 2902.62s]  No, it's not as good as I have. I key reroll. Hmm. Oh, what is this? Is that a smore?
[2902.62s -> 2915.10s]  I want the smore item. Must be charged. Oh, it must be charged by picking up soul hearts,
[2915.10s -> 2923.45s]  then spawns three soul hearts, two angel room items, only spawns two soul hearts and one angel
[2923.45s -> 2936.71s]  item if a devil deal was taken previously. I don't think that's good here. Soul hearts.
[2936.71s -> 2940.47s]  Where am I going to get so I could make them, but it would take like that's not worth it.
[2940.47s -> 2958.25s]  Oh, wait, it doesn't know what this is. Oh, what is this? I know that was dumb,
[2958.25s -> 2963.83s]  but we could. But it could have been another double coin. You understand what I'm saying?
[2967.10s -> 2972.41s]  Enemies in current room are weakened, slowed and take double damage for one minute. Um, yeah.
[2972.41s -> 2979.53s]  What do you mean? No, what do you mean? No, it couldn't have. Yes, it could have.
[2979.53s -> 2987.00s]  You can read what it is. No, look in the corner, the question mark. No, you know. All right. All
[2987.00s -> 3002.31s]  right. All right. All right. All right. I am ready to move. I've got enough and dominate this.
[3002.31s -> 3006.33s]  Quick tip for those of you that are a new dividing of Isaac. If it's two enemies,
[3006.33s -> 3011.19s]  they share the same health pool, but focus one. Otherwise you'll have to handle two enemies the
[3011.19s -> 3030.34s]  entire health bar. Focus one first. Make sure to get that down. Three broken hearts. This is,
[3030.34s -> 3039.16s]  this one's like too confusing to me. Eh, I never liked the orbiting, uh, orbiting items.
[3039.16s -> 3046.70s]  The knife is good, but you have to, you have to walk up and I always screw it up and get hurt.
[3046.70s -> 3051.18s]  All right. So what does a broke grants? Three broken hearts. So it's 0.75 damage.
[3052.62s -> 3070.22s]  Every fatal hit. What is it? Does that mean when I die, it blocks me? I can't die. That seems kind
[3070.22s -> 3082.92s]  of unbelievable, but it's going to lower your max HP. That's all right. It's going to be careful.
[3082.92s -> 3093.51s]  All right. Cool. I don't think I want anything else. It'd be nice to get these bombs. So why not?
[3093.51s -> 3111.99s]  Uh, I'm, it's worth the trade for me. I don't want the bombs. Well, broken hearts kills you.
[3111.99s -> 3123.30s]  Yeah, but I'll be, I'm not, I'm not going to get hit. You see how, how much is,
[3123.30s -> 3139.51s]  what's happening here? Look at this. Crazy chocolate or honey Teddy grams. Um, I'm going
[3139.51s -> 3144.98s]  with straight up original when I haven't eaten any of these. I haven't eaten this in probably 20
[3144.98s -> 3162.50s]  years. That's good. Charm tears. 10%. Can't you press buttons really fast? Oh yeah. Fast enough.
[3162.50s -> 3168.66s]  Ooh, we got a sale. We got a sale. We got a sale is huge. Look at all this. All right. There's a way
[3168.66s -> 3180.04s]  for me to do this with one bomb. Isn't there? Not. What is that? What does it pick up the bed?
[3193.50s -> 3218.52s]  Really? Wait, opens the door to the hush floor, regardless of the timer. Uh-huh. It's useless.
[3218.52s -> 3226.82s]  Could I go to fight the hush right now? Uh, I want to continue this. Wait, how much more?
[3226.82s -> 3232.38s]  I haven't even started to yet. Yeah. I'm just going to do it. I'm not going to use it.
[3232.38s -> 3244.22s]  Battery. Shit. That's the good one. Isn't it? Active items can be charged up twice and used
[3244.22s -> 3265.75s]  twice in a row. This bar soap, the eraser. Um, these are all active items, aren't they? Just
[3265.75s -> 3282.47s]  reroll. I'll reroll. Ooh, this thing is really good. You get items for free with this thing.
[3282.47s -> 3300.18s]  Definitely want that. And these are all kind of good. I think this is a win shaping up to be that
[3300.26s -> 3311.06s]  you see some more damage. Whoa, shit. Oh my God. My hands. Hold on a second. You ever just like sit
[3311.06s -> 3316.98s]  in your chair and like, for no reason, everything is insanely uncomfortable for like 10 straight
[3316.98s -> 3321.08s]  seconds. It's just like, wow, like everything. I hate sitting here right now. You know what I
[3321.08s -> 3333.26s]  mean? It's like, fuck. And then it goes away and everything's fine. That's so much money.
[3335.91s -> 3375.08s]  I want to use it. Just keep rolling. As long as I don't do something stupid. This should be good.
[3375.08s -> 3402.34s]  Sure. I got a dentist appointment in the morning and I might have to have my wisdom teeth removed.
[3402.34s -> 3408.97s]  Um, I think pretty much everybody has to go through that. So don't worry. I had my wisdom
[3408.97s -> 3425.83s]  teeth taken up. Range. Yeah. Those of you that are lucky to not even have wisdom teeth, right?
[3425.83s -> 3434.18s]  That can happen. You're lucky. That's good. I was born with no wisdom teeth. That's really good
[3434.18s -> 3442.82s]  because you don't have to do any of this shit. Yeah. Giga Chad. Yeah. Skill issue. Having wisdom
[3442.82s -> 3457.54s]  teeth is a skill issue. I want the range. Divorce papers plus one bone heart tears up. Spawns the
[3457.54s -> 3478.94s]  mysterious paper trinket. What's the paper trinket? Is it any good? Bad. All right. I'm good.
[3478.94s -> 3489.22s]  This is, I got a good build right now. I don't mess it up. I couldn't even afford it anyways.
[3489.22s -> 3516.38s]  Yeah, that was easy. Oh, that's one of my favorite items. Purgatory. Red cracks spawn on the ground
[3516.38s -> 3525.10s]  of hostile rooms. Welcome to the crack. Someone's homing exploding. No. And then this. Oh, this is
[3525.10s -> 3541.18s]  the one I lost. Does it take away the bad hearts? Of course not. Still really good. It's worth it.
[3541.18s -> 3555.53s]  I didn't go in here, but I'm not going to. All right, let's go. Okay. Well, I keep forgetting.
[3555.53s -> 3576.86s]  Speed up. Very good. It's okay. I feel like I have to take this. You missed a coin. Zero out of 10.
[3576.86s -> 3588.10s]  Where's there a coin? I didn't miss a coin. What are you talking about? In the Satan room?
[3588.10s -> 3604.58s]  There was a coin in the devil room. What? You're lying. You're lying. Hold on. This is important.
[3604.58s -> 3608.98s]  Hey, just got word from the boss. If you lose this run, you are contractually obligated to
[3608.98s -> 3613.70s]  install the POG mod. Sorry, King. I don't make the rules. And then they're crunching. There's
[3613.70s -> 3629.05s]  a cat crunching on a brick and like emote eating a brick or something. Um, all right. I hate doing
[3629.05s -> 3642.25s]  this, but I have to. Oh, at least I know what it is. What about that one? Nice. Now what is this?
[3642.25s -> 3653.10s]  Bone heart. What just happened? Did it take my bone heart? Wait, my money. Oh fuck. Wait a minute.
[3653.10s -> 3681.94s]  What? God damn it. Sorry. I don't need that. All it does is just makes your, uh, familiars
[3681.94s -> 3690.70s]  stick in much closer. Here's up range up and spawns three random hearts. Yes, I will take it.
[3690.70s -> 3706.55s]  And those are great. Those are great hearts to have. This is, this is really great. I should
[3706.55s -> 3716.89s]  absolutely wipe the floor with everything now. What is this? Mucormycosis. I'm terrified of this,
[3716.89s -> 3727.06s]  but I'm going to get it. Explode. What the fuck is all this? Oh, I forgot. I didn't do this part.
[3727.06s -> 3775.19s]  Don't remind me that this is in here. All right. Pretty good. Very good actually. Whoa. And that
[3775.19s -> 3816.33s]  hurt me. No. Okay. Good. Jesus. Yeah. I definitely going to win. There's no way I don't. Well,
[3816.33s -> 3844.33s]  I mean, who knows? Who knows? Oh, Vinny. Vinny raid. Vinny raid. What's up? Vinesauce viewers.
[3844.33s -> 3852.90s]  Thanks to the Ray Vinny. We're just doing some late night Binding of Isaac. It's been a while
[3852.90s -> 3860.86s]  since I walked out of the room, but it's okay. We're good to go. Uh, if you've never played
[3860.86s -> 3867.62s]  Binding of Isaac, check it out. Card in the item room. Yeah. I'm not going anywhere yet.
[3867.62s -> 3880.14s]  What was that? What was Vinny doing tonight? I made some friends in college
[3880.14s -> 3888.14s]  because we all enjoy your streams. That's really cool. That makes me happy. That makes me feel
[3888.14s -> 3904.12s]  really great. Hope you guys become pretty good friends. Am I going to get coins if I do this?
[3904.12s -> 3913.51s]  No, they have to have coins in their eyes, right? All right. It's time for me to, uh,
[3913.51s -> 3920.14s]  activate this and then leave and everybody yelled at me because I missed an item. This actually is
[3920.14s -> 3935.02s]  kind of horrible. Hold on. Oh, I was mad and then I was happy. It hurt. It hurt, but I made a bunch
[3935.02s -> 3951.48s]  of money. What is this thing? Wow. Okay. Guppy's hairball. Moving swings the hairball around the
[3951.48s -> 3962.02s]  ball grows when it kills an enemy. Dude, these are both good because won't it just grow permanently
[3962.02s -> 3977.78s]  if I don't leave the room? Piercing tears and they ease this. Okay. All right. I don't want to
[3977.78s -> 3988.92s]  go too crazy here because I'm, I don't have that much help. It's deceiving. I feel like I should
[3988.92s -> 4007.22s]  probably get this. Okay. And then this too, right? Cause I get a half a soul heart every time a new
[4007.22s -> 4019.93s]  floor. Does that count when we're greed mode? D6 D6 rerolls, pedestal items. That's pretty good,
[4019.93s -> 4028.50s]  but I, I feel like this thing is so much better. There's only two more floors. Yeah. So I think I
[4028.50s -> 4035.69s]  want to keep the money busted, dude. You have to get it. It's too late. It's too late for that.
[4035.69s -> 4044.60s]  Maybe next, uh, next fucking round, dude. I don't think I want anything. Yeah. I'm not shopping
[4044.60s -> 4059.56s]  anymore. Not about the money. Use the jar right now. This is seven. That's a card, right? Oh no.
[4059.56s -> 4075.86s]  Is it seven or eight? Use the jar and then get the D6. It shows what it is. Look in the jar. It has
[4075.86s -> 4085.78s]  the item. Late night hangout session. Just chilling. No, we don't, we don't, we're not
[4085.78s -> 4092.68s]  like paying that much attention to what's inside of the thing. Nah, no, I'm saving my money. No,
[4092.68s -> 4103.74s]  I don't want anything. I got, I still have another floor to go. Two more. Let's go. I'm leaving.
[4103.74s -> 4122.68s]  Thank you. Bro. Bro. Bro. Shaking my head. Uh, how do I get rid of the menu on the right?
[4122.68s -> 4140.94s]  I don't like that one. I like the one on the left. I like dog food. Nice. Remember
[4141.58s -> 4165.82s]  your tea. Oh shit. Thank you. Yes. Ooh, good. That's not so good, but that means I don't die.
[4178.26s -> 4186.02s]  Clearing rooms no longer charges active items. Feeling damage to enemy slowly fills up the
[4186.02s -> 4204.57s]  charge bar. This one's good. Red stew. What is that? 21 damage up. The damage up wears off over
[4204.57s -> 4216.92s]  three minutes. Excuse me. Killing enemies while the effect is at. So will this last through the
[4216.92s -> 4229.78s]  next floor? Buy that at the end and speed run the last floor. All right. Yeah. I think that's,
[4230.42s -> 4238.04s]  I'm going to buy this at the end and then just rent through the rest of the game. Watch that
[4238.04s -> 4251.82s]  be the downfall. Wait, I hate this thing. The Ludovico technique. This thing's awful. This is
[4251.82s -> 4257.38s]  the worst item in binding of Isaac, isn't it? I think it actually might be the worst item in
[4257.38s -> 4274.76s]  the whole game. Yeah, I'm not taking it. I'm going to do this though. Really? All right. Let's go.
[4274.76s -> 4288.15s]  Oh my God. Absolutely. What an ungodly amount of damage. Just absolutely ungodly. I don't even
[4288.15s -> 4314.04s]  know what's on the screen. That person just spawned over here. Luckily. Holy shit. Okay.
[4315.82s -> 4345.77s]  Don't leave. That's why this game gets so wacky. If you get the right materials, whatever. Shit.
[4345.77s -> 4361.61s]  I want an angel room for once. Oh, I thought it was the other way. I thought it was horizontal.
[4362.49s -> 4378.28s]  You don't wait. What you have to skip. People were just spamming something. Call is really good.
[4378.28s -> 4393.58s]  You're going to one shot breed. Oh, okay. Okay. So I got 57 coins. I want to make sure I do this in
[4393.58s -> 4422.78s]  the right order. Ooh, yes. Take reds. Take the 4.5 volt. Okay. I still want money for the end,
[4422.78s -> 4445.61s]  right? Pill discount. Yeah, the pill sucks though. Throne keys deal damage. Stew and go? Stew and go.
[4445.61s -> 4450.42s]  Stew and leave. All right. All right. All right. Right. I'm taking the stew and I'm fucking running.
[4450.42s -> 4491.43s]  Go. Hurry up. Oops. How can I tell how much time I have left? Oh my God. Do I just, who cares? Just
[4491.43s -> 4503.86s]  leave? I think I just have to leave. Do I even buy anything? What is it? I don't know what to do.
[4503.86s -> 4532.14s]  What's happening? I don't know what's happening. Let's go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
[4532.14s -> 4548.30s]  Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Oh my God. What should I do? Should I use the item?
[4548.30s -> 4552.50s]  Holy shit. What the fuck just happened? What just happened? What did I just do?
[4553.14s -> 4590.44s]  Oh my God. What the fuck is happening? What is this thing? Ace of diamonds?
[4592.17s -> 4606.87s]  I have 70 coins. I should have done greedier. Damn. Greedier would have been simple.
[4609.11s -> 4633.21s]  Oh, I already got it. Did I do something wrong? Broke it. Is that bad? It goes, does it go back to
[4633.21s -> 4645.32s]  zero? All right. Nice. That was a good first run. You've already unlocked everything. Well, I haven't
[4645.32s -> 4658.57s]  unlocked everything. Somebody else did. And I just put the save file onto my computer. All right.
[4658.57s -> 4667.27s]  Let's do a real one. Why do I have a million of these? Oh. All right. You guys are going to have
[4667.27s -> 4702.36s]  to guide me to some cool, crazy new content. So one of the big problems I have with Isaac. Have
[4702.36s -> 4713.14s]  you guys ever jumped on a trampoline before? You ever get off of a trampoline and then jump normally
[4713.14s -> 4724.79s]  on the ground and it feels crazy. It almost feels like gravity is times 10. When I finish an Isaac
[4724.79s -> 4733.94s]  run and I start over, it's that same feeling of, Oh, I feel like I have just dumbbells attached to
[4733.94s -> 4755.85s]  me. We just go, what is that? Is this gold? Money? I've never seen it. Gold rocks. It's gold. Yep.
[4755.93s -> 4770.63s]  Gold. Not bad. Playing as Kane. Unfortunately, I have no bombs. Probably the worst character in
[4770.63s -> 4787.35s]  the game. As you get a hit on the first floor in Isaac, how many hours do you have in this game?
[4787.99s -> 4814.81s]  Over a thousand. Try Tainted Kane. Kane has PhD in repentance. He does? Wait, he does have better
[4814.81s -> 4833.43s]  pills, doesn't he? I was wasting $5. Tainted Lost is really fun. Well, I don't need it right now.
[4833.43s -> 4858.70s]  I do want to go over here. Secret room may be right here. Yep. Very happy about that. What
[4858.70s -> 4865.45s]  does Tainted Lost do? When was the last time you played this game? It was actually not that far
[4865.45s -> 4873.70s]  away. It was fairly recent. I want to say five, four months ago, four or five months ago.
[4875.66s -> 4886.54s]  And I didn't play for very long though. I come back to this game very frequently, play it for
[4886.54s -> 4891.90s]  a few days, play it for a week or two, and then it goes back on the shelf. Another couple of years
[4891.90s -> 4898.60s]  go by. I was back out. Maybe another six months goes by. I was back out. Just always there.
[4899.24s -> 4918.71s]  Oh, that's good. Have you ever 100% legit? No, no way. The furthest I ever got was
[4919.51s -> 4926.10s]  Delirium? I don't think I even beat Delirium. No, I beat Delirium. I think I beat Delirium a couple
[4926.10s -> 4951.59s]  times. Whatever expansion that was, that was the end. I want to go, no, let's just go. It was like
[4951.59s -> 4961.16s]  10 years ago. Delirium wasn't 10 years ago. Delirium was after birth, right? Or anti-birth?
[4962.28s -> 4969.34s]  Anti-birth was the mod that Repentance is based off of, right? I streamed that. I streamed that.
[4970.14s -> 4988.25s]  Forget about this. Yeah, you, all right. I remember you need to have spirit hearts,
[4989.24s -> 5010.12s]  bombs, right? I forget, I forget what you actually need. Double vision. One key, two bombs? No,
[5010.12s -> 5022.09s]  it's key, two bombs, two hearts. All right. My mom thinks you give cool tips and tricks. I don't have
[5022.09s -> 5027.86s]  the heart to tell her what you really do. Why are you making this sound so sinister?
[5029.90s -> 5033.74s]  I mean, we just like hang out and like crack jokes and play games.
[5035.29s -> 5049.45s]  It's not, I don't think it's that sinister. All right, let's go. I'm just going to do it.
[5049.45s -> 5055.74s]  Wait, what does the double vision actually do? I didn't read it. 50% chance of adding an extra
[5055.74s -> 5062.12s]  blind item in treasure rooms. So I can take two. That's pretty awesome. What about the super secret
[5062.12s -> 5067.77s]  room? I always skip the super secret room because I never know like reliably where it is, but it
[5067.77s -> 5073.19s]  has to be connected to a singular room. So therefore it could be the one all the way at the bottom.
[5073.83s -> 5080.98s]  It could be the boss room. It could be the big room. Wait, why is the big room? What's going on here?
[5082.30s -> 5091.70s]  Oh, cause I took the pill. Right, right, right, right. Wow. Well, okay.
[5102.62s -> 5118.50s]  What does the bone heart do? I'm filling it. I just filled it up. Oh, it's three hits. That's
[5118.50s -> 5134.42s]  really cool. So without a cheat sheet and without the mods to tell you, do you think this game is
[5134.42s -> 5148.79s]  more in need of you having a wiki open than Elden Ring? I think, I think actually, yes,
[5148.79s -> 5163.38s]  I think so. All right. So, uh, I need two bombs here, right? Or I need two soul hearts.
[5163.38s -> 5191.62s]  Okay. Which one of this is, oh my God, stay on the screen, dude, dude, get over here. Oh my God. And
[5191.62s -> 5206.60s]  I'm not even doing my own Isaac rule. So my Isaac rule is look, spend at least 60% of the time
[5206.60s -> 5213.27s]  playing the game, looking at where, at just you at Isaac only. If you look at Isaac only,
[5213.91s -> 5219.29s]  this goes for other bullet hell kind of games too. Don't look at the fucking thing shooting at you.
[5220.71s -> 5228.36s]  Look at the area in a circle around Isaac and just move out of the way. Done. Nice ego.
[5233.14s -> 5252.82s]  So I get to take both of these, which is one, uh, probably this. Yeah, this one's cool.
[5253.62s -> 5262.58s]  This one's more snappy. This one is better. Ah, spectacle tears are better.
[5269.82s -> 5272.54s]  Isn't there something weird with the bucket? Isn't there something weird?
[5273.42s -> 5276.38s]  Something strange with a bucket, right? I have to like go in one or something
[5277.42s -> 5281.02s]  or I need to, I need to blow one up. Something strange. I forget what it was.
[5281.66s -> 5321.62s]  It's a mirror. Oh, you throw up in a bucket. Oh yeah. You puke in the bucket. Secret room.
[5321.62s -> 5333.24s]  Um, right here. Watch this. So many people just went like, no, no, no. And I was right.
[5343.91s -> 5355.30s]  Yikes. That hurt. I don't want to lose the spirit heart. Otherwise the run is over.
[5356.02s -> 5367.38s]  The secret roomkeepers. Oh, that's right. This is not greed mode.
[5379.93s -> 5389.91s]  That's a volume. Should I turn it up a little or is it a, is it a good, is it a good volume
[5389.91s -> 5402.97s]  for like snoozing? What do you think? Good. I already answered that question by saying fuck you.
[5404.60s -> 5409.59s]  Oh, man. You're supposed to be snoozing. It's supposed to be like chill string.
[5425.21s -> 5433.46s]  Doesn't this mean something? This means something, doesn't it? That means something.
[5435.82s -> 5467.86s]  Bomb. Nice shop. Why is this shop so bad if this 999 coins donated? It's better than nothing.
[5467.86s -> 5524.33s]  Two of hearts. I lost my spirit heart. What? What? That kinda sucks. That kinda sucks.
[5524.33s -> 5544.07s]  Okay. I have a spirit heart. Did someone say, how do you have every unlock? Um, I just got the save.
[5544.07s -> 5551.00s]  That's just a save file that unlocks everything. I normally wouldn't have done that. But like I
[5551.00s -> 5554.92s]  said, in the beginning of the stream, if you weren't here, I've downloaded this game like
[5554.92s -> 5560.50s]  six times across like four generations of consoles and computers. So I just don't have,
[5560.50s -> 5570.17s]  I don't know where my real save file is. And it wasn't on the switch though. Oh, well hold down
[5570.17s -> 5580.62s]  R like right, like right bumper. What does it do? Hey, what'd you, what'd you do?
[5581.42s -> 5611.94s]  I was gonna, I thought I made it all the way out. Those things suck. Uh, tapeworm is,
[5611.94s -> 5632.06s]  eh, it's just range. Oh, this fire. Wait, there's something with the fire, right? Now what? Now go
[5632.06s -> 5640.41s]  in? Go in where? Find the mirror now. You just ruined the run. I did. I need to go find the
[5640.41s -> 5656.66s]  mirror. There it is. Okay. All right. What? I don't, I think I've only done this once ever.
[5657.38s -> 5678.74s]  What do I do? Don't get hit. But where do I go? Oh Jesus. These things suck. I'm dead. I lost.
[5678.74s -> 5689.10s]  I lose? Why did you tell me to do that? I've never done that before. What? What is it? Robo baby?
[5693.05s -> 5699.99s]  You walked in it. Oh, this thing is awesome. All right. I care more about this one anyways.
[5700.63s -> 5710.34s]  I can just be a coward. This is perfect. You did that on your own accord. Yeah, but I, I don't know.
[5711.14s -> 5718.33s]  I didn't know it was the equivalent of people telling me to hold R. I thought it was like an
[5718.33s -> 5731.90s]  item. By the way, I'm playing the game with the other character. I'm just trying to avoid getting
[5731.90s -> 5762.36s]  hit. Bro, what are you doing? I'm hiding and playing the game with the robot. I just love when that
[5762.36s -> 5777.67s]  happens. Already a better run. Yup. Already a better run. And watch this. I'm not going to
[5777.67s -> 5789.90s]  use this because I need two to get down to that place. I will always have two. I was going to
[5789.90s -> 5856.02s]  play good. Why are you a Reddit avatar? Kind of weird map. Here's up. You don't need soul hearts.
[5856.02s -> 5860.46s]  You just need to survive two hearts worth of damage. Did they change that? Was that different?
[5860.46s -> 5874.84s]  I feel like it was two soul hearts before. It was an anti-birth. Oh, okay. It was a change from
[5874.84s -> 5908.23s]  repentance. Whoa, they're in the ground. Bro, what are you doing? Is it meat in here? What is this?
[5908.23s -> 5932.54s]  I feel like I can blow that up. Yeah. I think I'll roll the dice here. It's pretty good for
[5932.54s -> 5942.95s]  my coward gameplay. It's a nice chill stream. I like it. Thanks for streaming. Thanks for hanging
[5942.95s -> 5966.36s]  up. Coward strat's not going to work against the mother. Hold on. I think it's going to work
[5966.36s -> 5982.81s]  pretty well. Really? I'm standing in the corner and I still got hit by that. That was like the
[5982.81s -> 5988.42s]  DVD menu that always hits the edges and never gets in the corner. And it went in the corner first
[5988.42s -> 6061.30s]  try. Let's just go from all sides. Hmm. Droid rage. There's two or just one. Go kill it. That's
[6061.30s -> 6071.34s]  not worth it. Too spooky is great for cowards. But I have, I'm going to literally one heart. No,
[6071.34s -> 6077.96s]  I can't take that. I take too many hits already. Wait, I can open that for free.
[6078.52s -> 6112.36s]  Let's see what's in here. Donate. That's cheating though. Just that I want to make sure everyone's
[6112.36s -> 6122.18s]  aware. My power might go up. It's very windy here in Vegas. Lights just flickered. So just be aware.
[6122.18s -> 6126.26s]  If it does, it was cool. It was really cool hanging out with you for a couple hours,
[6126.26s -> 6136.20s]  but that I did. The lights just flickered. So we'll see. If that's the case, a fantastic rest
[6136.20s -> 6143.91s]  of your night. Take care of yourselves. I'll see you again soon. But let's just operate on the
[6143.91s -> 6162.60s]  fact that it's not going to. All right, let's go. This very high wind gust in Vegas right now.
[6164.01s -> 6168.01s]  Yeah, sometimes it can get really wild. The big difference between this was actually kind of an
[6168.01s -> 6174.18s]  eye-opening experience for me because I lived in obviously Massachusetts, right? And Massachusetts,
[6174.18s -> 6183.27s]  it was snow, snow and rain. I had never really experienced high winds my whole life until moving
[6183.27s -> 6193.59s]  out here. And sometimes, I mean, sometimes you'll be sitting there out. We'll just be hanging out
[6194.15s -> 6205.03s]  and you hear. And it's as if there is a monster outside trying to knock down everything. It's,
[6205.03s -> 6209.03s]  it seriously feels like there's somebody like outside trying to like, like a gigantic monster
[6209.03s -> 6216.47s]  trying to like attack. It's fucking terrifying sometimes. Especially when you get those like
[6216.47s -> 6225.22s]  50 mile per hour gusts that the room kind of shakes the windows. You'll hear it. It's like
[6226.82s -> 6234.76s]  with this huge, scary gust behind it. And that's this is new. I've never experienced that before.
[6235.56s -> 6248.74s]  I remember there was a windstorm so bad that you could lean into it and not fall over. Whoa,
[6248.74s -> 6262.87s]  what's this thing? Spawn six random book of virtues wisps. I just take them. I don't know
[6262.87s -> 6282.58s]  what this does. Just use it. Use it when somebody did a troll face. What love crafty in hell do you
[6282.58s -> 6291.77s]  live in? Oh, Viva Las Vegas. I don't know what this does, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep it for
[6291.77s -> 6314.55s]  like an hour. I'm not doing that shit again. This is a rock. Vegas is a modern above ground hell.
[6319.32s -> 6325.56s]  Maybe I'm just like a contrarian or something, but I like it out here a lot. Talked about it
[6325.56s -> 6330.47s]  the other day. I really, I like it out here. Anytime you ever hear somebody talk about Vegas,
[6330.47s -> 6336.79s]  it's like, Oh, what a fucking P what a dumb place is a piece of shit. And I'm just like, I like it
[6336.79s -> 6348.65s]  here. I like enjoy it here. I think when people think of Vegas, they just think of slot machines
[6348.65s -> 6361.14s]  and drugs and fighting. So I'm not supposed to be screaming. It's late, but it's not really just that
[6361.78s -> 6382.07s]  it's 11 AM. What do you mean? It's so late for the North American audience late night.
[6382.95s -> 6389.11s]  Ooh, well, I don't want to do that because I don't want to touch the donation machine.
[6389.67s -> 6405.58s]  This is not bad so far. I could really use some better tears though. These tears are kind of
[6406.47s -> 6431.85s]  plain and boring. Oh wow. How do I tell my dog? He's a dog. Your dog does not understand English.
[6431.85s -> 6439.29s]  He understands the phonetic way that you pronounce his name and he hears that and he
[6439.29s -> 6444.79s]  locks that into memory. He knows like probably four words. Your dog knows probably 10 words total.
[6445.51s -> 6449.72s]  So if you tell your dog like your thesis statement or like a paper or something,
[6449.72s -> 6453.64s]  if he's going to be, he's going to hear if someone you talk to your dog, this is what he hears.
[6454.28s -> 6458.92s]  Mm hmm. Food. Good boy.
[6462.52s -> 6475.67s]  Your dog can process the language that you're saying by associating it with things.
[6476.39s -> 6485.58s]  They can, well, how many words can a dog know? It's like 20, right? Like 15. Dogs can like
[6485.58s -> 6488.94s]  understand like up to like 10 to 20 words or something, right? Like it's like, it's a little
[6489.26s -> 6507.96s]  low. It's 20. It's like 200. It's 400. It's 150. 60 to 180. 60. Yeah. Yeah. So they're,
[6507.96s -> 6516.02s]  and the thing is, here's the great thing about a dog. Dogs are so unbelievable because they so
[6516.02s -> 6524.04s]  badly want to understand. You know what I mean? They so badly want to understand what you are
[6524.04s -> 6535.96s]  trying to tell them. 180. Yeah. So basically 10. Yeah. But I was, I mean, I was very wrong,
[6535.96s -> 6541.58s]  but I was making a very clear point. If you try to tell your dog that they're a dog,
[6541.58s -> 6546.79s]  they're going to just hear the words that they understand, which is probably like treat.
[6550.46s -> 6557.72s]  Like, oh God, the light's flickered again. Oh, going down with the ship, boys and girls.
[6560.52s -> 6578.41s]  I'm going to keep this. You know, you got to think of a really funny cutoff word.
[6585.86s -> 6590.50s]  Cool. That was a big one. That was, I don't know if you heard that probably not over the game,
[6590.50s -> 6618.31s]  but that was, that one was chunky. That still has spikes on it. Worth it. You're going to be
[6618.31s -> 6635.32s]  in the wizard of Oz soon. Uh, reusable fortune. Question authority. What does that do? Is that
[6635.32s -> 6656.44s]  just the fortune telling machine? It's only 27 miles per hour. You'll be fine. Well, the powers
[6656.44s -> 6669.24s]  to well, gusts probably could be potentially more than that. Oh my God. I want that. That's, um,
[6672.12s -> 6679.62s]  that is amazing. Uh, should I just take all the money? I don't care. Give it, give me all the
[6679.62s -> 6705.37s]  money. Cheats, cheats, cheats, cheats, cheats, cheats, cheats. What does this thing do again?
[6705.37s -> 6732.55s]  I don't know. Friends from beyond. Just gives you from friends. Is it friends for the floor?
[6732.55s -> 6744.17s]  Friends for the room. I imagine it's probably just for the room. I don't need this anymore.
[6744.81s -> 6759.75s]  As long as they stay alive. Okay. Cool. Dude, get out, get away from me. I thought it was
[6759.75s -> 6783.27s]  going to bounce off the wall. Actually, probably the best three stats to get upgraded. Oh, I need
[6783.27s -> 6814.25s]  another bomb. That's the fire and then go in the mirror. I, that's how I died last time. I better
[6814.25s -> 6826.33s]  get this. I have to try as hard as I can. Where is the mirror? Is there a way I can make sure I
[6826.33s -> 6847.10s]  don't die or just play very well? Just be good and don't get hit. I already got, I mean, it's
[6847.10s -> 6870.28s]  already over. What did I do this? I'm leaving. You have light floating attack. Why? It seems kind of
[6870.28s -> 6896.22s]  good. What? Oh, did I just lose a heart by doing this in here? I did. I was on autopilot. I just
[6896.22s -> 6915.50s]  lost a heart. I think I have three bombs now. All right. Don't mess around. Where's my buddy?
[6916.70s -> 6949.93s]  Get up here and do stuff. Nice. Okay. Give me the item. Use the soul. Use the soul. Use the soul.
[6952.34s -> 6970.28s]  Oh, cool. I keep going. Should I fight the boss? I have a question. If I use this right now, will
[6970.28s -> 6988.98s]  it give me another hit? That's too risky. I'm going to go for it. Whatever. What's the worst
[6988.98s -> 7017.64s]  that happens? I lose. I think I'll be all right. Whoa. Oh, it's the same boss. That's fine. Yeah,
[7017.64s -> 7029.88s]  we're good. Here's up exactly what I wanted. All right. So now do I just go back through the
[7029.88s -> 7064.90s]  mirror? Cool. Good. That's not so bad. Yeah, that's all I really want to do anyways. Tinted rock.
[7066.94s -> 7105.30s]  Where is he? Yep. You're right. God damn it. Cheater. No, I did. I cheated to get that money.
[7106.44s -> 7121.16s]  You're absolutely right. Look at this speed. Secret room. There's a lot of places where it
[7121.16s -> 7131.91s]  could be. I don't really know which one. Hey, is it true that you bought a toilet plunger? 15 pounds
[7131.91s -> 7136.38s]  of brown beef and a... No, I can already tell you that's not true because of the second one.
[7164.28s -> 7192.36s]  Okay. Is that really worth two bombs? I don't think so. He's vegan. I'm not vegan. I'm not vegan.
[7198.89s -> 7208.02s]  He hates animals then. Come on. Oh, I ate red meat. Oh, you must be a fucking monster.
[7209.62s -> 7232.07s]  No, I... But I'm not vegan. Wow. What are you? Dumb? No, but I... Come on, man. Oh, this little guy
[7232.07s -> 7243.43s]  with a little rock. I will tell you that I have really tried to, I don't know, be a little more
[7244.60s -> 7255.48s]  aware of... Just like what I'm eating. Trying to cut back on... Trying to be better about what I'm
[7255.48s -> 7269.13s]  eating. Trying to eat more fish, right? Less meat overall. Just because, you know, I'm getting older.
[7269.77s -> 7286.97s]  Why don't I just do that? Re-stock. Never-ending stores. Oh my god. This is ridiculous. Okay.
[7286.97s -> 7300.70s]  So let's do this. Let's do this. Oh, it's not a full heart. Well, now it is. And now it is again.
[7300.70s -> 7342.07s]  That is actual bullshit. Why did I even buy that? Rip deals? You've wasted... What do you mean rip
[7342.07s -> 7352.23s]  deals? I got... Dude, I've got an end-game Zelda heart container over there. I'm fine. I could get
[7352.23s -> 7362.47s]  hit a hundred times and be alive. I'm good. No, this is not even end-game Zelda. I don't think I
[7362.47s -> 7372.28s]  have a... This is 100% completionist Andy Zelda. I think I fought Ganon with like seven hearts.
[7372.28s -> 7392.02s]  Stop saying Andy. It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry. Clutch. I've never fought this boss before.
[7405.69s -> 7445.06s]  Oh, I get it. This is kind of fucked up. How could I have all these hearts? Jesus. Oh my god. He like
[7445.06s -> 7454.82s]  glues to you. Okay. Well, that's the first time I've ever seen that guy. I do need more damage.
[7454.82s -> 7476.38s]  Well, that's amazing to have. I think I still want to keep the hostile fly. That's a full heal.
[7476.38s -> 7491.40s]  It's incredible. I still want the... Don't... Thought I went in an accidently. Oh, the item room.
[7491.40s -> 7526.18s]  My power went out. LMAO. Be careful. God damn windy out there. But yeah, I'm trying to eat a
[7526.18s -> 7534.76s]  little bit better. And hey, however you eat, it's up to you. Are you vegetarian? All right.
[7534.76s -> 7554.17s]  Let's go. Up to you. You eat a bunch of meat. It's up to you. Ooh, angel room. Although I...
[7555.88s -> 7566.86s]  I do think that just for me personally, trying to cut back on just meat, meat like meat and cheese
[7567.82s -> 7579.22s]  is... It's just better. Just better for my slow 40-year-old fucking man metabolism. Man-sized
[7579.22s -> 7593.06s]  meals. Is there even enough time to do this still? Well, it's probably better at this point.
[7595.45s -> 7599.29s]  Re-rolls and restarts the floor. I think I might just do that. Why not?
[7600.09s -> 7606.47s]  What a McDonald's Andy. But I don't eat McDonald's every day. Neither should you.
[7616.04s -> 7669.94s]  This is the worst item in the game. I mean, whatever. Oh, thanks. Wait, you're 40? What am
[7669.94s -> 7697.50s]  I doing here? I don't know. You tell me. This dude is fucking ancient. I think I'm just going to do
[7697.50s -> 7705.98s]  it. Yeah, let's do it. Free stuff. I got tons of money. Not tons of money. I got tons of hearts.
[7710.94s -> 7750.25s]  Jesus. Well, now I do have tons of money. My God. How many pills?
[7778.90s -> 7784.63s]  Nah. That's a cool item, but I've obviously got way too much money.
[7829.74s -> 7848.62s]  Tammy's head is all right. Well, let's gamble. Candy heart. Pure love. Holy shit. Picking up
[7848.62s -> 7869.59s]  red hearts gives permanent stat upgrades. Seems really good. What is... Okay. Oh, that's cool.
[7869.59s -> 7907.56s]  Let's just do it. Oh, I turned it off. Shit. Oh, I didn't turn it off. It's kind of fun to do.
[7907.56s -> 7926.97s]  How do I already have 70 coins again? Break rocks and secret room entrances and damage enemies.
[7926.97s -> 7933.32s]  Landing a hit with the axe reduces its charge. Better than the cookbook, but this is probably
[7933.32s -> 7970.14s]  better overall. I can't even do it. Oh, I mean, no, I can't even do it. Stop buying pills. Well,
[7971.02s -> 7983.75s]  Kane has better pills. I'm trying to get stat increases with that. I'm not trying to get health.
[7983.75s -> 8013.75s]  Look at Amara. I'm already doing an ungodly amount of damage. Okay. Yeah, let's go. I fucking hate.
[8013.75s -> 8071.53s]  I hate this item. Who's shooting the boogers? Oh, it's a random baby, right? Oh my God.
[8084.55s -> 8093.16s]  That's great. No one's forcing you to use the book. Well, how am I supposed to do the use the
[8093.16s -> 8108.15s]  cookbook challenge? Is there everybody voted for a couple hours ago? I don't want to do that.
[8108.15s -> 8125.30s]  I already found the secret room. That's a lot of minus twos. Geez. That's an ungodly amount of
[8125.30s -> 8148.94s]  minus twos. I'm getting my ass kicked. Wait, what's going on? One makes you larger? Why is
[8148.94s -> 8160.22s]  it showing me that? Oh, okay. I want to be bigger. I want them to be able to hit me with incredible
[8160.22s -> 8206.26s]  ease. What does that do? I need to get all three of them. Oh, cool. Okay. I'll do it. Who's this
[8206.26s -> 8238.28s]  little guy I have here? I like it. Wait, what is it? Oh shit. Okay. Sorry, I'm reading mod chat.
[8238.28s -> 8284.26s]  Um, hold on. I need to write something. No, no, everything's good. No, I'm not. Wait, why is
[8284.26s -> 8306.60s]  this still happening? Oh, okay. I already have good pills. What does it do? Wait, should I just
[8306.60s -> 8329.24s]  get free pills? Does it make them even better? I don't think I need any items. Yeah, I was just
[8329.24s -> 8332.36s]  reading something in my chat. We're talking about something. It's really, really cool. Really nice.
[8332.36s -> 8351.85s]  It's a really, really cool, really, really nice thing. All right. Okay. And let me pay attention
[8351.85s -> 8373.66s]  now. Touch every button. All right. So buy hearts. Uh, I could buy hearts. You're right. As well.
[8373.66s -> 8395.50s]  Stock up. I'm going to say it's right. All right. There's the third one. Should I not press it yet?
[8395.50s -> 8403.86s]  Maybe I shouldn't. I think I've realistically only done this route three times. Maybe ever.
[8403.86s -> 8429.53s]  What's this? Press it and get in the mine cart. Where am I going? Why do they lose stats? Where's
[8429.53s -> 8475.27s]  all my stuff? What is this? Why is there nothing in here? Okay. No, didn't I? Have I never done
[8475.27s -> 8489.40s]  this? Is this? When did they add this? I piece too. That's fantastic. Um, how do I get out of here?
[8497.77s -> 8529.08s]  Oh God. Thank God. I have so much help. You. What do I do with that? I think I just figured that out.
[8529.08s -> 8564.65s]  Hurry up. I did it. Okay. Cool. Now what's the price of electricity? All right. That was pretty
[8564.65s -> 8570.28s]  cool. So what's the, what's the, what's the protocol now? Where do I go? Just keep going.
[8570.28s -> 8594.30s]  Just get more health. I have the sun. So that's good. Thankfully this baby is amazing. I could
[8594.30s -> 8612.57s]  go buy. Oh, there we go. I could go buy hearts though. There's a lot of damage. That's that.
[8612.57s -> 8623.24s]  It's better. That's just way better than the, uh, in the book. Please.
[8630.87s -> 8639.51s]  Hmm. The sacrifice room always seemed like just a waste to me. You have to step on it like seven
[8639.51s -> 8663.62s]  times for it to do anything good, right? Is that better than the laser? I could go in there and
[8663.62s -> 8674.98s]  get hit a bunch of times and use the sun card. Ooh, that's just amazing. This thing finds to the,
[8674.98s -> 8682.50s]  I wish I had this permanently turned on. This thing finds tinted rocks and secret rooms is
[8682.50s -> 8690.63s]  awesome. I don't have to, I don't even have to look, do the sacrifice room. I don't,
[8692.30s -> 8703.67s]  I really don't want to, I want all heal, use it 13 times. Exactly. No, it's not worth it.
[8703.67s -> 8722.57s]  The sun card is a full heal. Whatever this last boss is of repentance. Do you really think I'm
[8722.57s -> 8729.75s]  going to do this with only being able to take like eight hits? No way. Although
[8735.75s -> 8743.22s]  worth it. Don't do it this run. No, yeah. I, I don't even know what the boss is.
[8743.94s -> 8749.75s]  Whatever the final boss is with the knife or whatever, or whatever, whatever I get,
[8750.71s -> 8774.39s]  I don't know. Is it delirium? Nice. Strength, sun, get out of jail free card. Open all doors in the
[8774.39s -> 8804.36s]  current room. Uh, I'm just going to do this. I feel like it's the sun though. Use strength and
[8804.36s -> 8823.64s]  just keep. Yeah. Like I'll see it, but I feel like I want the full heal. You want to do the
[8823.64s -> 8832.82s]  true final boss. I'd like to see it. I'm going to hold onto it. I'm going to keep the heel. I think
[8832.82s -> 8848.47s]  it's way more important. All right. Now we're talking. This is some pretty, this is, this is
[8848.47s -> 8853.58s]  damage that can carry. I think the end of the run, maybe if I get one more good damage weapon, maybe
[8870.89s -> 8888.01s]  Ooh, awesome. Okay. That's pretty good. Finally locked enemy shots coming from the direct.
[8888.01s -> 8900.30s]  I think that's it, right? Salvation. It's probably that and just standing in the corner and look
[8900.30s -> 8905.88s]  right. It's the shield. It always is. Just go like this and just always make sure you're on the same
[8905.88s -> 8926.25s]  plane. Bomb the angel. This is for a key piece, right? Why did I not block it? I was standing
[8926.25s -> 8946.02s]  right there. Hey, why is it not blocking it? Is there anything else I can do before I leave
[8953.78s -> 8960.26s]  changes to pee pee poo poo? I mean, that's fine. People are going to ask what the fuck
[8960.26s -> 8976.97s]  that even means. Yeah, that's, that's all right. That works. Yeah. Funny. I think I'm just going
[8976.97s -> 8998.42s]  to go. Let's get out of here. Tired. I got to get up early. Get some sleep. Mausoleum. What's that?
[8998.42s -> 9023.93s]  I've never seen this before. It's five cents. I got it. I got it. Marbles. Oh, that kind of stinks.
[9023.93s -> 9044.12s]  I mean, I have, I have the fly. I don't think I'm going to keep the things. Still pretty good.
[9044.12s -> 9051.48s]  Yeah. A little late for that. Geez. Wait, that, I don't know if I want to touch that. That could be
[9051.48s -> 9061.61s]  the nine lives thing. That could be guppy. I don't want to touch that. That's going to bring me down
[9061.61s -> 9068.71s]  to one heart. I'm not touching that. I don't know what it is. Do it. Do it. Touch it anyway. No,
[9069.27s -> 9077.78s]  it's going to be Guppy's body. And I'm going to go down to one heart. Okay. I did it. I'm,
[9077.78s -> 9087.72s]  it doesn't matter. I don't even want it. So, all right. That was very scary actually again.
[9087.72s -> 9147.59s]  But what, why is this thing going? What's going on? Where am I? I don't know what I just did.
[9147.59s -> 9178.30s]  What happened? Where am I? It was a golden pill. I thought it was a money pill. I got to make my way
[9178.30s -> 9209.61s]  back to that room. I wasn't done. Is that a blade? Shit. I can't pick it up. No, it's going to be,
[9209.61s -> 9265.96s]  I can't touch it guys. What was that? Nice. IV bag. More prizes. Nightlight? Scared of the dark.
[9265.96s -> 9300.52s]  Oh, oh, it slows them if you look at them, right? This thing's kind of, yeah. You drink coffee every
[9300.52s -> 9316.28s]  day. Usually. Yes. Usually. It's a big part of my morning routine. What was it? What are you looking
[9316.28s -> 9347.29s]  at? That was weird. Sometimes it's damage up. I completely forgot about the active item. Oh,
[9347.29s -> 9362.98s]  shut up. Ow. All right. I got to clean it up a little bit. I'm, this is pretty sloppy.
[9362.98s -> 9390.01s]  This is pretty sloppy. Hold on. Actually perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Perfect. All right. Give
[9390.01s -> 9418.46s]  me hearts out of here. How would you use your trinket? Trinket. Flying. You need flight. Flight
[9418.46s -> 9442.04s]  is the, you are, get a trinket from the arcade. Scared the absolute shit out of me. Forgot that's
[9442.04s -> 9460.79s]  what that did. All right. Where's the flying trinket? You swallowed the, wait, there is not
[9460.79s -> 9471.40s]  one. You have no trinket. Wait, why did you guys tell me to come back here? Your fly ate it. Shiny
[9471.40s -> 9482.81s]  rock? What are you guys talking about? You need the trinket for something else. You ate it. Take
[9482.81s -> 9493.06s]  it. You swallowed your old trinket to get a new one. Oh, whatever. We're fine. Oh, you're good.
[9493.06s -> 9524.07s]  Thank you. I'm looking for hearts. Don't get hurt. God awful room. No, not spirit hearts. Regular
[9524.07s -> 9540.87s]  hearts. Spirit hearts. Whatever. This is cheap. One plus one free forever. Jar of flies. Pretty
[9540.87s -> 9573.69s]  cool. Coupon. Now you can fly. Ooh. Jumper cables. School bag. Extra active item. And that thing.
[9573.69s -> 9589.75s]  Give me a regular heart, dude. Come on. Oops. How do you switch between them? How do you switch
[9589.75s -> 9616.82s]  between active items? R2? Oh, okay. Right. I think this is fine. Stop giving me this shit.
[9616.82s -> 9631.46s]  Give me something else. Use the coupon in the shop. I already did, didn't I? Yeah, I did.
[9631.46s -> 9648.63s]  Isaac's dream. Bat chest. Wait, this is like a red empress. Plus two health up. Ears up. That
[9648.63s -> 9670.60s]  glass. All right. I'm just going to use it right now. Isaac. I feel like bat chesting Isaac is
[9670.60s -> 9687.88s]  that makes me feel a hundred years old. It's not accurate, right? No, it's not at all. Isaac
[9687.88s -> 9703.13s]  bat chest. No, that's no way. I actually do not believe you. That would be a shock. All right.
[9703.13s -> 9708.74s]  Let me go get the other thing that was over here. I think I got a pretty good build to try to finish
[9708.74s -> 9717.86s]  this. I've been on this run for an hour. I do play this game so slowly though, because I'm so
[9717.86s -> 9738.17s]  afraid of getting hit and like hitting spikes on the ground. Where was it? Using a pill car to ruin
[9738.17s -> 9744.97s]  is a 25% chance to drop a copy. Oh man. That would be amazing if I could, if that actually worked
[9744.97s -> 9759.85s]  with this. Well, let's hope so. 25% is really not, that's a place to bomb. It's not? What is that?
[9759.85s -> 9806.18s]  That is very clearly an X on the ground. All right. Let's go. This is the siren hatch book.
[9806.18s -> 9830.70s]  Now I definitely want to keep this cool. Bomb the skull. We keep going. Is there anything I need to
[9830.70s -> 9839.21s]  know on this floor? Oh, is that quad shot? No, it's not. What is this? I was going to say that's
[9839.21s -> 9860.33s]  game over if it is. I mean, it kind of, it is shoots four shots sometimes. Yeah. Oh, it is cool.
[9860.33s -> 9874.09s]  Nice. All right. As long as I play pretty well, I might be able to see the final, final boss.
[9874.65s -> 9900.89s]  And then I want to do another greed mode. I love greed mode. Ow. Give me a good card. Hmm. Who
[9900.89s -> 9929.66s]  Nintendo? No. 5% is really low, but if you get hit all the time, it's going to be okay. I would love
[9929.66s -> 9963.03s]  some more area. I feel like my tears are really small. Range up. Nice. You want to fight the final
[9963.03s -> 9973.42s]  repentance final boss or the true final boss of the game? Which one is more interesting? What would
[9973.42s -> 9986.23s]  you say is the more, Oh yeah, that's cool. You should see that the beast. It's too late to do
[9986.23s -> 9990.65s]  the beast. You're locked into the repentance boss right now. Oh, that's all right. Whatever.
[9990.65s -> 10006.62s]  It's cool. If you have the knife, it's the repentance boss. Okay. Might as well have 7.5
[10006.62s -> 10011.34s]  luck. Do I have anything that is spawning off of luck or works off of luck? I don't think so.
[10012.30s -> 10045.67s]  Jesus. Oh, he popped out of my head. Do I just don't control them anymore? He's awesome. He's
[10045.67s -> 10081.50s]  awesome. I should just get hit. You like old book smells. Um, probably. I mean, I, yeah,
[10081.50s -> 10104.39s]  I would say so. I like the smell of, uh, like a seller, like a basement. There's this really
[10104.39s -> 10115.72s]  specific basement smell. It's really, it's, it's great. It's such a nice smell. What is that by
[10115.72s -> 10129.40s]  the way, that smell, what is it? No, it's not mold. It's a very specific thing. It's like musty.
[10130.04s -> 10146.10s]  No, not asbestos, asbestos, damp concrete. Yeah. I like the smell of wood too. All right. It's time
[10146.10s -> 10154.66s]  for all of you to judge me. They make these dog toys that are wood, dog, chewy toy things.
[10156.62s -> 10164.47s]  And I love the way these things smell. These things are for dogs and they're so, they smell
[10164.55s -> 10173.53s]  so good. They have this unbelievable, unbelievably wonderful wood scent on them.
[10176.63s -> 10182.38s]  This dude is huffing his dog's toys. You know, I don't, some of you that don't, if you know,
[10182.38s -> 10200.20s]  you know, right? If you know, you know, should I make it harder? This is gonna, this is stupid,
[10200.20s -> 10215.70s]  but I get more damage, right? I could also do this and just spam it at the boss. Just hold onto coins
[10215.70s -> 10236.46s]  and then just go, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, the red thing. I need more damage.
[10236.46s -> 10255.85s]  Oh, that's how you do it. This range is ridiculous. Why is this pill so huge?
[10255.85s -> 10284.76s]  What just happened? This is the fastest I can go. I'm capped out for speed. Okay. Cool. You've got
[10284.76s -> 10323.86s]  max stats. Feels good. What the hell is that thing? I can pick that up yet. Dog toys. Otto has so many
[10323.86s -> 10330.46s]  dog toys and I can't get rid of them because he likes all of them. Sometimes he'll just go in.
[10330.46s -> 10337.37s]  He's got a little toy, little toy chest thingy and he'll just pick out a different one every few
[10337.37s -> 10345.80s]  days. And sometimes one, a toy will be unused for months and months and months. And then randomly
[10345.80s -> 10355.70s]  one day you'll see him go over there and he'll pull out Mr. Flamingo. And he's like, Oh, Mr.
[10355.70s -> 10360.34s]  Flamingo today. And he's throwing it around and he's having a bunch of fun with it. He has not
[10360.34s -> 10376.92s]  played with this for weeks. What is this clip? This clip looks like old. Wait, I did this already?
[10376.92s -> 10408.33s]  Hold on. Turn this down for a second. You've already seen me do this. Hold on. I'm not going
[10409.21s -> 10428.01s]  to chew on this on stream, right? This is what I'm talking about. It's this weird tree trunk
[10429.94s -> 10438.46s]  and I'm not going to smell it because it smells like my dog's mouth. But when this is out of the
[10438.46s -> 10448.60s]  package, brand new, it smells fantastic. He's right. Right out of the package. It smells like
[10448.60s -> 10453.88s]  this awesome wood smell. This has been in my dog's mouth. Here it is. I'm not going to put it in my
[10453.88s -> 10465.74s]  mouth. Somebody said, dude, why is David Spade on your stream? This is when I was growing the
[10465.74s -> 10476.55s]  mustache out for the baseball stream. Or was it after the baseball stream? This is two years ago.
[10478.12s -> 10486.73s]  Wait, what? Why did I have a fucking mustache two years ago? What was this for? Why did I do this?
[10486.73s -> 10492.65s]  What was the point of this? Was I doing a bit or something? I must have thought it was funny.
[10492.90s -> 10510.68s]  I had to have thought it was funny. Why did I do this? You did this after shaving one night
[10510.68s -> 10517.56s]  and thought it was funny, as Holly says. I just thought it was funny to do this. I guess so.
[10518.50s -> 10532.31s]  All right. Well, I thought this was like a few months ago. Anyways, yeah, true. It's good.
[10532.31s -> 10541.35s]  I'm not sitting there huffing dog bones, but it's got this great cedar smell. I think they put it
[10541.35s -> 10551.50s]  on there specifically. You look 45. Yeah. I ain't getting any younger, man. I'm, you know,
[10551.50s -> 10567.94s]  whatever. But people age. You get older. The way it is. All right. So if I walk through this door
[10567.94s -> 10579.08s]  is a time to fight this super boss. That's really cool, dude. Smell whatever you want. I don't care.
[10579.08s -> 10614.14s]  Play the game. Oh, this is different. What did I get hit by? That was almost perfect. Okay. What?
[10614.14s -> 10635.66s]  It's the left, right? I'm doing a lot of damage. So much more damage. All right. And then to the
[10635.66s -> 10659.93s]  left. Let's go. Mom's heart. Okay. I'm used to this. Shit. My God. They're everywhere.
[10660.97s -> 10703.10s]  What is hitting me? Did I win? Oh, room dumb ass. Hey, it's don't you think it's too late
[10703.10s -> 10731.82s]  for insult? It's too late for insult. Corpse one zombie, which coin friend should I give it to?
[10732.46s -> 10741.74s]  He'll never read this. It just did. None of them. First one only. I don't know what the other one
[10741.74s -> 10761.11s]  does in the end. Okay. It gives rotten hearts. That doesn't fill up the regular hearts though,
[10761.11s -> 10784.84s]  does it? Also, I need to activate the flies. Let's just do that in the next room. Fuck. I had it.
[10792.63s -> 10819.22s]  Should have wharfed it. Oh my God. So much money. Really? What am I going to do with all this?
[10819.22s -> 10893.51s]  Did I just get that? Did I have that floating fly before? Rot hearts take double damage. That's
[10893.51s -> 10915.02s]  fine. Better than nothing. If I had resident sleeper to a positive message, would you read it?
[10915.02s -> 10922.70s]  Resident sleeper is not necessarily a negative emote. The context of resident sleeper. For
[10922.70s -> 10929.59s]  instance, you could say, I'm getting really sleepy right now, but this is like a really chilled
[10929.59s -> 10939.11s]  night. Resident sleeper. Like, oh, I've got so many exams I have to study for a resident sleeper.
[10939.11s -> 10948.62s]  Like it's, you know, I'm tired. So now if you said this stream sucks, resident sleeper,
[10948.62s -> 10971.21s]  I'd ban you. That's the context. Have you, I don't think you've ever banned anyone ever.
[10972.81s -> 10984.49s]  Um, I don't, I don't know. Maybe a long, maybe a long time ago. I mean, it's a lot of mods.
[10985.61s -> 10996.36s]  The mods, I'll take care of it. Mods act 100% on my behalf. So you know what they're doing.
[11000.94s -> 11008.87s]  Electric key. You know, you did, you banned someone for posting a video that had a jumpscare
[11008.87s -> 11018.74s]  noise in one of the VR streams. You banned them for three days. I remember it vividly.
[11018.74s -> 11028.28s]  Well, all right. So it's been, it's been at least one. Hey, just, just relax and you won't get
[11028.28s -> 11052.49s]  fucking banned. It's that simple. Ooh, I'm small. Glass eye. All right. The tears are huge now.
[11066.22s -> 11074.36s]  All right. We got damage. I just gotta get, keep my health up. What is going on?
[11075.32s -> 11122.10s]  Come on, dude. It's turning into a real annoyance. Roll. All right. Well, I might as well just go
[11122.10s -> 11129.11s]  spend the money, right? Cause this is, is this it? One more after this. This is getting close.
[11129.11s -> 11166.46s]  Probably nothing worth buying. Light is overpowered. Another run after this. Yeah.
[11166.46s -> 11173.93s]  I'll do another greed run after this. Whatever happens here. That's cool, but not a big deal.
[11173.93s -> 11187.00s]  What the, oh my God. I didn't know they get, I thought they shot the beams.
[11187.64s -> 11227.32s]  I gotta find the secret rooms. Yeah. Yes. I can't pick that up. Power pill is cool, but no.
[11227.32s -> 11252.55s]  On the skulls. Yeah. Might as well. Let's go. Turns out it was worth it. Oh, lovers again.
[11252.55s -> 11280.68s]  I wish I could pick that up. Take some damage and come back. Um, wasn't I, I already was hurt.
[11280.68s -> 11289.16s]  I couldn't pick it up. You'll get stat buffs. Wait, when I pick up red hearts, that's right.
[11289.16s -> 11311.08s]  Yeah, you're right. Let me just go get hurt. Oh, I can't get hurt by the spikes.
[11311.08s -> 11331.86s]  Somebody hurt me. I'll just do it myself. I've got 40 bombs. Um, it's all right. Nice. All right.
[11331.86s -> 11350.87s]  Let's go. All right. I got old jar. Everything good. All right. Let's do it. This is almost
[11350.87s -> 11363.19s]  instant kill. Good because I don't, I am taking a lot of damage. Okay. Good. Good thing. I do a ton
[11363.19s -> 11380.15s]  of damage. Are there any more hearts? I don't think so. I could stand across the whole game
[11380.15s -> 11414.36s]  at this point. All right, let's do it. Uh, wish me luck. Oops. I'll just bring it up.
[11414.36s -> 11423.74s]  I'll come back in here. Use it right now. Oh, it's time to make the devil mad.
[11423.74s -> 11469.77s]  No, it doesn't. It just makes the devil mad. You're cranky. Am I? I think so. I'm not,
[11469.77s -> 11513.35s]  how am I cranky? I'm not even, I, let's go. Uh, oh, what do these do? What do these do?
[11513.35s -> 11523.08s]  He's actually saying you're in a really good mood. What is this thing? Open shops for free.
[11523.08s -> 11548.12s]  Really? These things, my friend though? Weird. I'm just so fast. When you get to like 2.0 speed in
[11548.12s -> 11553.53s]  Isaac, it's actually kind of a detriment. You move so quickly and you run into shit all the time.
[11566.90s -> 11588.68s]  Your son card? No, I'll get it. I will not lose it. Let's play everything first. Where are my
[11588.68s -> 11609.67s]  glasses? Where are my glasses? You swallowed it. Why is that happening? Why is that happening?
[11609.67s -> 11626.41s]  Where are my glasses? The marbles. Oh shit. That's, that's actually pretty unfortunate.
[11626.41s -> 11651.94s]  You keep the effect. Oh, there's so much. Okay. Let me go get my thingy. Where's my thingy?
[11651.94s -> 11657.53s]  Get pink eye instead. Pink eye is probably better than this. Yeah. Poison damage would be.
[11657.53s -> 11674.89s]  Yeah, for sure. I would nine, almost 9.0 luck. Are you kidding me? Where's the card?
[11674.89s -> 11690.95s]  Geez, that scared me. Get the fuck out of here. Wish I could sell some of these keys for hearts.
[11690.95s -> 11721.96s]  Something's wrong. Bombs are key. Who cares? Even more range. So much range. Can you please
[11721.96s -> 11725.64s]  play my favorite game? Oh, this is Ball Fondler. I'm reading Ball Fondler's comment and I didn't
[11725.64s -> 11733.91s]  think it was Ball Fondler. I just started reading a message and it just happened to be Ball Fondler.
[11733.91s -> 11738.95s]  Hi Ball Fondler. How are you? How are you doing? Well, and let me, let me just answer Ball Fondler
[11738.95s -> 11745.59s]  directly. Um, no Ball Fondler. I'm not going, I, I'm not going to buy all the flying carpets you
[11745.59s -> 11758.02s]  made on the auction house. I don't play that game. Stop asking me to do that. I can't, whatever.
[11758.02s -> 11768.01s]  Let's go. Hey man, can you please play my favorite game? I'm like, Oh, I'm going to read. What's this
[11768.01s -> 11788.62s]  person have to say? He's just everywhere. He's everywhere. Come on, do it. Skyrim is, I don't
[11788.62s -> 11796.33s]  know. Is it weird that I really just kind of like don't want to play Skyrim? I already ruined
[11796.33s -> 11804.09s]  everything for myself playing it. I put on a bunch of stupid dog shit mods and I've ruined the whole
[11804.09s -> 11845.54s]  game. I can never play it normally. All right. Am I ready? Skyrim fucking sucks without mods, dude.
[11845.54s -> 11915.74s]  Are we good? I'm going to go for it. Hope I don't lose. Mother. Oh my God. Holy shit. Whoa. Jesus.
[11915.82s -> 11999.16s]  Oh my God. Oh, can't even see. Did I do it? Did it? Nice. That was crazy. I mean, 11.7 damage.
[12000.15s -> 12004.82s]  I have a lot. I, that took, good thing I had the sun card. Otherwise I was dead.
[12004.82s -> 12011.06s]  Sun carry. Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen this cut scene.
[12047.94s -> 12049.70s]  I'll show you a monster.
[12058.01s -> 12105.13s]  I can't even look at you. Isaac has a voice song.
[12136.22s -> 12141.13s]  Did they give Isaac a voice in repentance? I don't remember in the other ones. I'm talking
[12141.85s -> 12166.89s]  for some of the final cut scenes. Yeah. Oh, what did that say? I didn't see it. I liked over chat.
[12166.89s -> 12186.41s]  That's really cool. All right. I'll try. Greedier might as well. Who's good for a Greedier. So I do
[12186.41s -> 12201.70s]  Greedier with one of the characters. Try the beast to a beast and trending. Who's a good character
[12201.70s -> 12221.56s]  to play with? I love Samson. Wait, painted Samson. This is good. It's fun. That's right.
[12221.56s -> 12242.55s]  Cause it looks like this. So is it worth the same as regular Samson? If you get hurt or do you have
[12242.55s -> 12256.60s]  to, how does it work with this one? Hey, it does not work that way. Wrong difficulty notes. It's
[12256.60s -> 12272.82s]  not hard. Yeah. It's hard. You're Greedier. You were supposed to play Greedier. Yeah. Then somebody
[12272.82s -> 12278.74s]  said, kill the beast. And I was like, you know what? Maybe I'll try that. I'm going to give it
[12278.74s -> 12292.97s]  like one solid attempt and then I'm going to play the other one. He's just more fun. So how does
[12292.97s -> 12311.96s]  this work? I'm turning red, but I'm not in my damage isn't going up. You'll see like, look,
[12311.96s -> 12335.42s]  I'm about to explode. Okay. So that you turn into that and it lasts for a few seconds,
[12335.42s -> 12344.71s]  the more you kill, the longer it lasts. It doesn't have a charge bar. He doesn't have charge bars on
[12344.71s -> 12364.38s]  Omega Lul. If they're distracting. So it's probably better just to do melee then, right? And not throw
[12364.38s -> 12392.42s]  it. There really are zero coins in here now. That's so funny. Um, give me one second. I want
[12392.42s -> 12407.06s]  to get some water. Actually, you know, I might make a tea. Oh, Northern lion, Northern lion. What
[12407.14s -> 13197.51s]  about it? Northern lion's awesome. I'll be right back. I'm going to get a tea. Okay. Hello. Hey,
[13197.51s -> 13214.02s]  I need to make my tea. It takes about four minutes to steep. That scared me. I'm trying to do,
[13214.02s -> 13217.91s]  I told you, like when I come back from breaks now, especially when it's this late,
[13217.91s -> 13242.12s]  I try to do a little like, I'll be like, I only got the clown makeup on here. What's the music
[13242.12s -> 13254.47s]  playing? It's just the Isaac music. Do I put anything in my tea? Not usually. And it's not
[13254.47s -> 13264.20s]  because of flavor. It's more so laziness, but there's a peach tea and put the bags in it's
[13264.20s -> 13270.49s]  steeps. And then I just drink it, take the bags out, drink it. Like getting the honey, getting
[13270.49s -> 13283.99s]  sugar, get it, taking it out, squeezing it in, stirring it up. I'd rather just drink it. Uh,
[13283.99s -> 13290.57s]  but no, I like putting that stuff in my tea. I've been pretty basic about it though. Same with
[13290.57s -> 13299.08s]  coffee too. I've been drinking a lot of black coffee, a lot of just regular ass tea. Manuka
[13299.08s -> 13308.58s]  honey is superior. Yes, it is. Manuka honey is unbelievable. It's thick though. Manuka honey is,
[13308.58s -> 13320.84s]  it's a paste. You get a big chunk of it, stir it in. Manuka honey is really good for you too.
[13320.84s -> 13335.22s]  It's like a superfood, isn't it? I'm just getting into tea. This is helpful. You know, I go through
[13335.22s -> 13344.90s]  phases. Sometimes I'll drink tea for months and then I won't drink it for a year. It's weird how
[13344.90s -> 13356.20s]  you body and your brain decide to do that. Weird. What is the baseball stream? Um, it's the California
[13356.20s -> 13375.27s]  circus versus the Maryland magicians. A very, very tough game. Very close game. All right, let's go.
[13375.27s -> 13385.19s]  Uh, we're, this is where we left off, right? Tea tier list. I used to drink a rooibos red tea,
[13385.19s -> 13389.16s]  which is actually not really tea at all. It's not like a tea leaf. It's actually
[13389.16s -> 13401.24s]  like a bush or something, right? But I did that because of my digestive problems. It's good. I
[13401.24s -> 13417.37s]  think it tastes really good. It's pronounced cannabis, not rooibos. No, it is rooibos. It's
[13417.37s -> 13433.50s]  like Roy. Yeah, it's Roy does constipated. No, I'm not going to have colitis. Oh, here we go.
[13433.50s -> 13446.87s]  Oh, nevermind. I'm standing here. I've been diagnosed like three times and I've been told
[13446.87s -> 13457.80s]  two or three, two or three different things, but we don't need to get into the details of my IBD
[13458.52s -> 13481.91s]  because no, just know that I have it. Okay. Thumbs up. Sure thing, dude. Why can't I pick this up?
[13481.91s -> 13498.30s]  Fake money. I need a bomb. It's too heavy. Uh, IBS and IBD are different. IBS is irritable bowel
[13498.30s -> 13506.79s]  syndrome. IBD is irritable bowel disease. Uh, IBD is something that you have typically for life
[13508.52s -> 13515.30s]  and it's usually in the like Crohn's disease, colitis, fructitis. Uh, I believe IBS is a series
[13515.30s -> 13534.09s]  of symptoms. I can't get that nickel. I have IBD and I initially got diagnosed with colitis.
[13534.89s -> 13547.14s]  This is a long time ago. And then I had another sigmoidoscopy and the doctor was like, Hmm,
[13548.02s -> 13552.02s]  no, it still might be colitis, but we're going to treat you for this. Now we're going to treat you
[13552.02s -> 13558.87s]  for ulcerative proctitis. I was like, Oh, okay. I went to the doctor again and had a full
[13558.87s -> 13568.15s]  colonoscopy. This is back a couple of years ago. Uh, when I took that big break in 2020,
[13568.55s -> 13583.58s]  was it 2019? No, no, this was before the break. Uh, how do I do the beast? The same path that I
[13583.58s -> 13605.11s]  took before. Just go do a regular run. Okay. Uh, but yeah, during that, during that colonoscopy
[13605.11s -> 13617.98s]  that I had, it was kind of, you probably have colitis again. Well, not again, but the way that
[13617.98s -> 13624.68s]  colitis and Crohn's disease work is Crohn's disease can affect anywhere all up and down your whole
[13624.68s -> 13635.43s]  like gut, all your digestive tract, everything. But colitis and ulcerative colitis and proctitis,
[13635.43s -> 13650.70s]  they affect very specific parts of your colon. This is, we're having a while. I haven't talked
[13650.70s -> 13659.19s]  about any of my medical problems in a while, but it's time to let's talk about my medical problems.
[13659.19s -> 13685.19s]  How much time do you have? All right. Hey, I got all night. Weird to talk about this during Isaac.
[13686.71s -> 13700.90s]  What time like the present, right? Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going.
[13705.56s -> 13716.86s]  Okay. Now I see why people think this is cool. So the idea is you just do this and clear as
[13716.86s -> 13736.92s]  many rooms as you can. Okay. That's really good. Wait, wait, there was ASCII art that got into the
[13736.92s -> 13750.18s]  channel. It was there really? That's been a long time since that's happened. Oh, nightbot got it.
[13750.18s -> 13761.26s]  Oh, okay. Hey, I, by the way, I'm not encouraging that you're going to get probably timed out or
[13761.26s -> 13766.30s]  banned if you do that. It's just, it's been a long time. I've not seen ASCII art in a long time.
[13769.85s -> 13782.98s]  Really? That's surprising. So during the Christmas stream, that other channel,
[13783.99s -> 13801.86s]  that other channel was just, that was a, that was a fucking mess out of it here. I got enough
[13801.86s -> 13827.98s]  money, right? Nope. What about auto ASCII art? I think the problem with ASCII art is not the fact
[13827.98s -> 13836.46s]  that it's ASCII art, but the fact that it just blows up. It's the fact that it blows up the whole
[13836.46s -> 13852.70s]  chat room. It just takes up the whole thing. And trust me, when I say this, you think I'm going to
[13852.70s -> 13857.90s]  actually sit here and tell you, you really think I'm going to sit here and go, why did that thing,
[13857.90s -> 13862.70s]  that thing just die? But do you really think I'm going to sit here and tell you that I've never
[13862.70s -> 13881.62s]  laughed at ASCII art? You're out of your mind if you think that. You've laughed at ASCII art. Of
[13881.62s -> 13893.24s]  course I have. Every single one of you here has. I don't want to, I don't want to hear anybody
[13893.24s -> 13902.47s]  pretending in here that they have not chuckled at some form of ASCII art at some point. Well,
[13902.47s -> 13913.03s]  I'm not talking about like, no, I'm talking about you just get like, that's kind of funny for a
[13913.03s -> 13968.26s]  second. Go, go, go, go. Hurry up. Oh, it's all right. I have something I want to test. Josh,
[13968.26s -> 13983.24s]  what do you want to do? You want to test something? Okay. Let's see it. You have the floor, Josh.
[13989.16s -> 14011.51s]  Uh oh. Didn't really work. Why did it show up twice? Yeah, it showed up two times. No,
[14011.51s -> 14022.02s]  let me scroll up. Where is it? Yeah, it showed up for me two times. I think it was doubled.
[14032.06s -> 14038.23s]  It worked on mobile. Probably the size of the chat, right? And whatever your font size is,
[14039.11s -> 14078.34s]  size of the window. Uh, Josh, time yourself up for five minutes, by the way. No homing bombs.
[14078.34s -> 14096.92s]  See, when I get to the depths too, is when I have to do a different thing. If I even make it there.
[14096.92s -> 14107.22s]  Oh, come on. I got it. I did it. Pretty sloppy so far. What's your favorite way to prepare a
[14107.22s -> 14110.70s]  chicken? You were saying something about the Christmas stream. Oh, just saying the other
[14110.70s -> 14115.34s]  channel had a ton of ASCII art in it. Cause we didn't, I don't, I think the whole thing with
[14115.34s -> 14120.89s]  that second channel, we had a couple of meetings about it, like what to do with it. And it was
[14120.89s -> 14124.89s]  just like, you know what? Fuck it. Just, just let them do whatever they want. But to an extent,
[14124.89s -> 14131.10s]  right? It was like, how much moderating tools do we actually put on there? And it was like,
[14131.10s -> 14152.63s]  you know what? Just who cares? Let them have some fun for like 20 minutes. You know, I get you.
[14153.19s -> 14159.24s]  This person wrote, dude, can you please talk louder? I'm eating corn nuts. You cannot do
[14159.24s -> 14167.29s]  anything while on corn nuts. It is nothing you can do besides sit quietly in a chair and eat them.
[14168.01s -> 14175.72s]  There's no activity. There was nothing you can do. It is one of the only foods on earth that
[14175.72s -> 14184.09s]  requires total isolation. And I like corn nuts, but that's, that's a really big factor when I'm
[14184.09s -> 14203.11s]  like, I don't really want to eat them. Dude. Okay. I got a corn nut story for you. I swear
[14203.11s -> 14207.91s]  I was in a hotel room one time and they were corn nuts. Oh yeah. I guess like usually when you,
[14207.91s -> 14212.39s]  when you go to a hotel and I do this, I, all right, I'm going to get, I'm going to make sure
[14212.39s -> 14216.39s]  I have a couple of waters. Cause I don't, you know, obviously you don't want to, oh, the water
[14216.39s -> 14220.63s]  that's on the table is nine dollars. Like, no, no, no, I'm going to get water. I'm going to get a
[14220.63s -> 14226.18s]  couple of snacks just to have them in the hotel room. And then one of them was corn nuts. And I
[14226.18s -> 14230.74s]  swear, I swear to God at about two o'clock in the morning, I was eating these corn nuts just in the
[14230.74s -> 14237.14s]  hotel room. And I was actually scared that I was going to wake up somebody else next to me in the
[14237.14s -> 14245.34s]  hotel room next to me. I'm serious. It was like, boom, boom, boom. And I, I, sometimes I felt like
[14245.34s -> 14255.06s]  I heard like movement in the other room and I'm like, this is so, am I loud? Like I, it would not
[14255.14s -> 14262.18s]  have surprised me if like the 2 a.m. dead silent hotel crunching, somebody heard it.
[14274.36s -> 14288.57s]  Somebody said, those are prey instincts. Like, I don't want to hear that. Like the wolves are
[14288.57s -> 14304.28s]  going to hear me crunching. Oh my God. That's so funny. Oh, that's wow. That's actually
[14304.28s -> 14321.14s]  unbelievably funny. Ray instinct. I'm going to be thinking about that all night.
[14321.78s -> 14352.36s]  Shit. I don't want to die. Dude, would tears up make this just disgusting? Well, there it is.
[14353.90s -> 14368.95s]  No. Okay. So just go down, right? Not going through there. Did you end up trying ceremonial
[14368.95s -> 14376.63s]  matcha yet? I've had it before, but I have not bought it in a long time. I remember having it
[14376.63s -> 14384.20s]  like once. Did I, I had like a really good one. I don't know if it was like ceremonial grade. I
[14384.20s -> 14397.18s]  don't remember. It may have been. What about mochi? Uh, you're talking about the little
[14398.14s -> 14404.73s]  ice cream balls that have the dough on the outside, like the soft dough with the ice cream in the
[14404.73s -> 14414.47s]  middle. Okay. I have, I do have opinions on them. My opinions on those are if they are very small
[14415.40s -> 14420.23s]  and I mean the size of, you know, the little ones that are like, it's because silver dollar.
[14422.42s -> 14428.18s]  Oh, no, no, no, no. That's mochi ice cream. Okay. Okay. Well, I like the mochi ice cream better than
[14428.18s -> 14434.36s]  the regular mochi then something about that contrast of that dough and it's not freezing
[14434.36s -> 14439.00s]  cold and you bite in and it's like, wow, this is cold. Um, it has to be little though. I don't
[14439.00s -> 14446.98s]  like the big mochi balls. It's kind of too much, but mochi ice cream is unbelievably. It's
[14446.98s -> 14468.63s]  unbelievably good. Mochi ice cream balls are one of those snacks that it's a multi-layered experience
[14470.70s -> 14477.45s]  is a visual. The visual is when you bite into it, like you get to see that cold,
[14478.25s -> 14484.49s]  like dry ice foam. You know what I mean? That, like that, that mist that when you breathe out
[14484.49s -> 14491.11s]  on a freezing cold day, it's like fucking ice breath. Oh, that's a visual. That's what that
[14491.11s -> 14505.85s]  adds to it. It only happens for like one second. Sometimes it's just like a little rough and then
[14505.85s -> 14511.96s]  it tastes really good. It's got texture for two different kinds of texture flavors. Strawberry
[14511.96s -> 14520.62s]  mochi ice cream. I would put up there as probably as high as I could for desserts. I don't, I don't
[14520.62s -> 14527.58s]  love the green tea ice cream, green tea mochi. Not a huge fan, but strawberry is holy shit.
[14530.30s -> 14551.85s]  Doesn't get better than that. Mango. Oh, I'm not sure I've ever had mango. So I have a question.
[14551.85s -> 14555.85s]  Can we, are we ever going to be able to have a conversation about any singular item
[14556.97s -> 14563.64s]  without somebody saying that I'm going to put that singular item up my ass? I think we've gone,
[14563.64s -> 14600.52s]  I think we've gone too far. The fondler effect. Kill the meme. Kill the meme friend. Kill the meme.
[14601.24s -> 14619.69s]  Let the man be born. You brought it up though. Yeah, I told you when I talked about kill the
[14619.69s -> 14629.38s]  meme stream too that I'm going to die. Is that I'm a fault of this too? Mike, did I lose? What
[14629.38s -> 14645.19s]  happened? Oh, damn it. All right. Well, now that I understand how the character works, I'll do it
[14645.19s -> 14671.16s]  again. Restart. Well, my voice sucks. Now I want to do Greedier. There we go. Good start.
[14672.06s -> 14692.60s]  Greedier is going to be amazing with this character. Nice. You revive as Lazarus. Oh,
[14692.68s -> 14707.13s]  I like that. Oh, this is unbelievable in Greed mode. Sprinkler is a god tier item here. How come
[14707.13s -> 14713.91s]  you don't play on keyboard? Every other game you insist on playing keyboard. I do. I feel like I'm
[14713.91s -> 14722.79s]  playing on a controller way more than half the time. I prefer controller. Yeah, I usually play
[14722.79s -> 14730.15s]  on controller, don't I? Maybe not for like an FPS or something, but most action games I'm on a
[14730.15s -> 14737.10s]  controller. Okay. Well, this is good. This is a good start. I'm going to walk through here.
[14737.66s -> 14759.66s]  This game's hard on keyboard. Um, anytime where I need to use my right, my WASD is fine, but I don't
[14759.66s -> 14764.14s]  know, using like the arrow keys to shoot. I feel like my hand would, my hand kind of hurts after
[14764.14s -> 14776.52s]  doing it for a while because you play this game with the right hand on the arrow keys, right?
[14776.52s -> 14797.70s]  Yeah. All right, let's do it. I forgot how much Greedier just gives you nothing. All right,
[14797.70s -> 14826.55s]  let's go. This is so good here. Wow. I mean, I'm getting, I'm getting hurt, but
[14827.19s -> 14867.66s]  only 11 coins. Holy shit. That's bad. Uh, I feel like that's going to kill me. I will die
[14867.66s -> 14882.49s]  from this thing. I think that's all good. Pick up. Not, not a troll bomb. Oh, it's regular bombs.
[14882.49s -> 14895.77s]  Damn. Okay. That sounds pretty good. I can buy a key. Also pretty good here.
[14895.77s -> 14917.02s]  Have you ever had a Ramune? Ramune? Japanese soda. I have not. Ramune. Ramune. Ramune. Okay.
[14917.02s -> 14960.01s]  Oh, this might end poorly. Oh God. I'm gonna end poorly. Don't. Oh shit. Damn it. I kind of
[14960.01s -> 14974.84s]  got in trouble there. The timer is shorter on Greedier too, right? By a lot, isn't it?
[14974.84s -> 15014.98s]  Well, that's good. Good start. Now give me Duffy. Uh, the only Japanese soda that I've ever,
[15014.98s -> 15026.09s]  I've wanted to try. It was a, it was a green bottle and it was, what, what was it? It was like a,
[15026.17s -> 15033.86s]  like a mango cream soda or something. What was it? It was a, no, yeah, it was a melon soda.
[15033.86s -> 15041.19s]  Mango cream soda. Cream melon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was a cream melon cream soda. Is that correct?
[15042.54s -> 15048.28s]  Yeah. It was like a milk melon soda. That's like the best one. Is that a good one?
[15052.04s -> 15061.19s]  So good. What type of melon? It was, I think green. It was like a green melon.
[15061.75s -> 15113.61s]  All right. Let me, uh, I gotta, I gotta focus up here. Okay. 30% fire rate for the left eye only.
[15114.74s -> 15124.70s]  Sure. And a key. You said you don't like honeydew or cantaloupe and that they're the same.
[15124.70s -> 15133.50s]  Well, not that you put melon in F tier. I need to correct the record. I don't like the melon
[15134.31s -> 15140.71s]  fruit. The flavor, the melon flavor is all right. But every time I have melon,
[15141.43s -> 15147.59s]  it's the texture is, it's sort of like chewy and hard. It always is the shittiest quality thing
[15147.59s -> 15153.00s]  in the fruit cup. It's always like somehow just not good. It's like, I don't know. I feel like
[15153.00s -> 15162.20s]  I get a lot of rind pieces or something. It's just not, it's cause it's not ripe enough.
[15162.20s -> 15168.79s]  Yeah. But I don't know. But I've had bananas that are not quite all the way ripe and they're
[15168.79s -> 15179.99s]  perfect. I like the flavor of a melon, but I just don't like the texture is not like my favorite.
[15179.99s -> 15198.26s]  What the hell is this thing? They hated him because he spoke the truth. Hey, whatever fruits you like,
[15199.59s -> 15208.02s]  that's up to you. My ideal fruit combinations. If you're talking about your ideal fruit,
[15208.02s -> 15220.79s]  what is your ideal fruit scenario? It's fresh strawberries, fresh pineapple, grapes, blueberries.
[15220.79s -> 15233.59s]  And that's it. Like if we're talking about mango, mango. Yeah. Apples are right. I like apples alone
[15233.59s -> 15241.24s]  though. If I'm talking about like a, cause usually melon is with a bunch of other fruits. You see
[15241.24s -> 15247.32s]  melon part of a fruit cup. You see melon on a board with here's a bunch of like cheeses and
[15247.32s -> 15264.84s]  crackers and melon and straw. Usually it's not alone. Melon is the best part of the fruit cups.
[15264.84s -> 15270.79s]  That pineapple is my favorite part. A good fresh strawberry that doesn't taste like nothing.
[15272.14s -> 15282.97s]  Sometimes a lot of strawberries can kind of taste like nothing. Thanks for letting me farm that.
[15282.97s -> 15298.49s]  Appreciate it. I was risky, but whatever. I did it. Yeah. Strawberry experience can be really,
[15298.49s -> 15303.80s]  really bad. It can be really, really good or really bad. I've been to a strawberry that was
[15303.80s -> 15307.72s]  really chewy and had almost no flavor. And then I've been to like a succulent strawberry.
[15310.38s -> 15313.02s]  It's like a T it's a commercial. It's like a television commercial eating it.
[15326.82s -> 15334.87s]  Homegrown and the most flavorful. Ludwig ate a $500 strawberry on stream. Really? Was it,
[15334.87s -> 15342.73s]  was it fucking good? Holy shit. Don't go in that. Okay. Yeah. Cause I want the angel room.
[15345.02s -> 15357.48s]  It was mid it was mid. It wasn't, it was not very good. It was just normal. It wasn't worth the
[15357.48s -> 15368.25s]  price. Honestly, 500 bucks to me is, I just don't, I don't think there's like a fresh fruit or I
[15368.25s -> 15374.14s]  don't think there's, I don't know if there's a food item that I think is like individually singly
[15374.14s -> 15383.13s]  worth $500 to me. I think you can get pretty much any high quality food is I mean, it's talking
[15383.13s -> 15387.85s]  about like at a restaurant at least like even like a place that's like a couple hundred bucks
[15387.85s -> 15394.63s]  a plate. I don't know if you go very much higher than that. After that, it just becomes, well,
[15394.63s -> 15403.34s]  we missed it with a, a candied mist spray. It's like, let me just eat the fucking strawberry,
[15403.34s -> 15410.02s]  dude. Like, I don't, who cares. It's coated in a thin layer of, of mango film. It's like,
[15410.02s -> 15427.06s]  is that really worth 700 bucks? Not really. 500 bucks. That's crazy. That sounds pretty good
[15427.06s -> 15456.17s]  though. Yeah. You spend 500 bucks on more important stuff like family guy. That's right. I'm way
[15456.17s -> 15473.26s]  better at this than you. I, I bet you are count on it actually. Uh, that's the thing. No. Okay. So
[15473.26s -> 15482.31s]  wait, somebody said family guy 30 season box set. Is it 500 bucks? Think about all the laughs you
[15482.31s -> 15496.33s]  could have one strawberry for the family guy, entire box set collection is that's talking about
[15496.33s -> 15511.22s]  the value on that one. None of you are taking the strawberry. Get out of here. I guarantee none of
[15511.22s -> 15536.01s]  you would take the strawberry. Whoa. Oh my God. I don't know how much heart, how many hearts I have.
[15536.01s -> 15573.24s]  This is actually kind of scary. Stop. Stop. Stop. I hate these enemies. Here we go. HP and luck up.
[15573.24s -> 15590.01s]  Your size up. You need some more range. That's pretty abysmal. Isn't it? You could look back
[15590.01s -> 15611.66s]  on eating a $500 strawberry and laugh. Yeah, you could. There's value there. I'm buying this. Eh,
[15611.66s -> 15617.90s]  I thought it was going to, it could have been the diamond. It could have been the one that doubles.
[15617.90s -> 15648.15s]  It was dumb. It was five bucks. I didn't, it wasn't 500 die. If I do that anymore. Well,
[15648.15s -> 15660.33s]  here's range. I'm scared to do the nightmare mode because I feel like I'm going to lose. I feel like
[15660.33s -> 15705.22s]  I'm going to die. Oh, fuck. I didn't get a key. I'm dead. I'm alive. Bowl mapping effect
[15705.22s -> 15717.64s]  spawns a random wisp, spawns one additional wisp with each use up to 12. And this one is worthless,
[15717.64s -> 15732.60s]  right? Your faith grows. I don't, wait, I don't get it. A random wisp on one wisp with each use.
[15736.76s -> 15749.40s]  So will this just refill every time I, the button is pressed? I think so, right? I wish I had more
[15749.40s -> 15762.84s]  money because that's very needed right now. Oh, let's be dumb and cool, but I don't want it.
[15762.84s -> 15791.03s]  I mean, that's nice. That's pretty good. I don't have any more money. Oh, no. Oh, this is the,
[15791.03s -> 15799.54s]  wait a minute. Oh my God. I can, everything's fine. Oh my goodness. Wait, should I open this
[15799.54s -> 15813.85s]  or should I buy? Hold on. I'm doing it. Nice. Um, all right. I'm going to buy a key. I forgot
[15813.85s -> 15830.79s]  I even had that. Oh, it's the lard, right? That's what it is. God, don't flex an enemy or projectile
[15830.79s -> 15839.24s]  right before Isaac would take damage from it. It needs to deflect projectiles near it. It needs
[15839.24s -> 15848.54s]  to be touched after deflecting to be reactivated. Holy shit. Nah, I think this thing is better.
[15849.69s -> 15878.39s]  Wait a minute. Like a dollar. You can use ace on enemies. Oh, I thought it was an
[15878.39s -> 15886.97s]  item on the ground. All right. So if I use this right now, what happens before I do it?
[15886.97s -> 15895.40s]  Poker chip. 50% chance for chest to spawn extra pickups or to contain a single fly.
[15896.12s -> 15913.22s]  Money. I know what that does. I know what that does. Good. Inexpensive keys. Very good. Very
[15913.22s -> 15937.24s]  good. It will spawn a wisp. But will it refill? Nice. Okay. Let's try it. This thing has already
[15937.24s -> 15977.93s]  protected me twice. Why is this thing so little? Where'd he go? Where's my friend? Where's my
[15977.93s -> 16012.55s]  friend? Geez. Oh my goodness. These things just spam. Oh my disaster. Actually a disaster. All
[16012.55s -> 16039.82s]  right. Damn. That's it in a locked gold chest. You gotta be kidding me. What are you saying?
[16039.82s -> 16045.06s]  Seven bombs. Removes the delay between bomb placements. You can just spam it.
[16045.62s -> 16055.86s]  It's kind of terrifying. Oh, so it keeps leveling up. I get it. Well, hopefully I can make it to
[16056.42s -> 16084.73s]  probably probable. Oh, I'm dead. Oh, I'm not very good with this character.
[16084.73s -> 16095.19s]  Two up close and personal. You get that speed and you sprint around. It's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[16095.19s -> 16117.91s]  I was never very good with melee in this game. I like range. Let me use original Samsung. Tainted
[16117.91s -> 16131.22s]  Lost. I'll try it after this. This is actually my favorite character. When I said it was came,
[16131.22s -> 16181.42s]  it was alive. I made it up. That was an unbelievable room. Oh, should I do that?
[16181.66s -> 16189.62s]  Should I do that right now? Should I hold this for a little longer? I made the whole thing up.
[16189.62s -> 16240.04s]  Do it now. It's a lot of money. We're getting to use the head. Oh, that's great. 25 coins on
[16240.04s -> 16254.34s]  the ground. This is how you make greedier actually reliably doable because now I'm essentially the
[16254.34s -> 16258.90s]  coins that are on the ground are the coins that I would have had in regular greed mode throughout
[16258.90s -> 16267.72s]  the course of the whole playthrough. So let's go. Like these are the amount of coins that I would
[16267.72s -> 16272.92s]  have had throughout the whole playthrough. Get lucky with a card. It's not really reliable.
[16275.21s -> 16284.52s]  Multiple Isaac's damage, tears, range and speed stats, which multiplies Isaac's damage.
[16290.94s -> 16315.88s]  What's the recharge on this? It's bad. The range. What? Did I already go in there?
[16315.88s -> 16331.72s]  No, I didn't. Did I? I don't remember going in there. I went in there already. I went in there.
[16331.72s -> 16338.58s]  I'm thinking about the last playthrough. They blend together sometimes. All right. I'm gonna
[16338.58s -> 16373.80s]  this is dumb, but it might be brilliant. Let's find out. Here's bad. It was a bad idea. Hey,
[16373.88s -> 16378.86s]  never going to, you're never going to get the cool crazy thing. You don't try the cool crazy thing.
[16378.86s -> 16386.49s]  You could have dropped something unbelievable and everybody here would have been going home.
[16386.49s -> 16405.10s]  Holy shit, dude. You're so fucking cool, man. Just do you put the cool, man. You see, hey,
[16405.10s -> 16413.85s]  like, Hey, did you see what item he just found? I was called an idiot, but like, I mean, I don't
[16413.85s -> 16419.11s]  know. I think he's just, I don't know. He's like the coolest guy I've ever seen. I do not go in
[16419.11s -> 16439.03s]  there. Ego boosted over a kid's game. I think I would probably not want a kid to play this game.
[16439.03s -> 16464.49s]  I think that would be very bad. I don't think that would be a great thing. And that's the reason why
[16465.72s -> 16470.76s]  I opened that up with the key. Don't have a key anymore. Got the pill that opened the fucking
[16470.76s -> 16484.31s]  secret that has, look what's in here. A crazy door. What is that? Does this go anywhere different?
[16486.33s -> 16494.79s]  Nothing. It just goes down. It's the exact same one. Really? I think it just goes to the next
[16494.79s -> 16507.56s]  floor. Oh, if it has the ladder, that means it's like an item room, right? That's okay.
[16507.56s -> 16529.05s]  Yeah. Chairman, dude, that was so cool. Oh, it's up to my throat. Not good, but better than nothing.
[16529.05s -> 16534.52s]  I think, I think my body wants to sneeze probably what's about to happen. Yep.
[16548.10s -> 16551.86s]  One heart container while held was one coin container for keeper.
[16556.92s -> 16570.71s]  Thank you. Which one of these is better? It's just a health up.
[16589.34s -> 16664.58s]  Ooh, another tier is up right there. Nice. Come on. Good block. I hate how the elite
[16664.58s -> 16685.70s]  champions do a full heart. You'd be patched out of the game. That's like a really interesting
[16685.70s -> 16694.50s]  mechanic where it's, it's like, it should be the way that it is. The weird glitch. Yeah. It's like,
[16694.50s -> 16701.70s]  I don't know, glitched out. They should just remove taking damage. You know, I like, I was
[16701.70s -> 16708.78s]  going to say that, but I, yeah, I, I think I agree. Like I shouldn't be able to get hurt.
[16709.66s -> 16723.11s]  Like the top left should be nothing there. Like shit should just bounce off of me.
[16723.11s -> 16767.37s]  God, get in there. Will you stay still for a second? Get over here. You know,
[16767.37s -> 16773.16s]  I have a question for you all to be honest. This is a very, very interesting discussion
[16773.16s -> 16780.89s]  because I'm telling you, I would love it. Hear me out. This is really, really interesting to me.
[16780.89s -> 16795.48s]  So Polly and I are sitting on the couch and I was playing a game. So that's not the whole story.
[16795.48s -> 16805.72s]  So during this game, what do you mean I wasn't? Wait, let me tell my story. Okay. So that we,
[16805.72s -> 16812.76s]  we got food and I was playing and it's like, okay, so I'm playing this game. I'm controlling
[16812.76s -> 16820.46s]  my character running around. I'm doing stuff, but I want to eat. I want to eat. We want to eat food
[16820.54s -> 16828.74s]  and hang out on the couch. I wish I could press a button to have a bot take over and play the game
[16828.74s -> 16840.94s]  for me. Just like AI plays while I just sit there and eat. Don't you think that would be so cool?
[16840.94s -> 16844.54s]  Like I'm talking about, yeah, I'm talking about like a left for dead two bot mode where for
[16844.54s -> 16848.30s]  instance, like, like a wild hearts. I've been playing wild hearts. I have a fucking hilarious
[16848.30s -> 16851.18s]  clip that you guys need to see too, by the way. It's unbelievably funny. It's the funniest thing
[16851.18s -> 16858.66s]  I've seen all month and I'm not kidding. Um, so I just want to press a button and just have my
[16858.66s -> 16863.75s]  characters kind of walk around and like pick up stuff and like attack enemies and stuff. That's
[16863.75s -> 16869.02s]  just a movie, but it's temporary. Just pause it. No, but I want to like, I want, I want to continue
[16869.02s -> 16879.85s]  the, I want to continue. Just hold down select for five seconds and we'll, okay. We're in left for
[16879.85s -> 16884.23s]  dead two bot mode. It's just a bot takes over your character and you can sit there and eat your
[16884.23s -> 16887.75s]  cheeseburger, have your fries and like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the way I wanted to go.
[16887.75s -> 16894.17s]  And essentially the game plays for you for a little bit temporary. Just let Holly play while you eat.
[16894.17s -> 16902.02s]  She's eating too. That's stupid. I don't think, I think it's actually an interesting thing.
[16902.02s -> 16905.94s]  You don't think it would be kind of cool just to be like, all right, you play temporarily and it
[16905.94s -> 16919.94s]  would have, look, why not? I think that would be a really cool feature. This is why you have a child.
[16919.94s -> 16927.22s]  Hey, hey son, come here. Hey, uh, your mom and your dear old dad over here want to eat our, uh,
[16927.22s -> 16939.54s]  look at McDonald's. Can you play, uh, wild hearts? What's even the point of the game? Well, I'm not,
[16939.54s -> 16949.13s]  I'm not, not going to play. I just, while I'm eating, it's just in food mode. It's food mode.
[16949.13s -> 16954.84s]  Like, Oh, like start right bumper, right bumper, right bumper settings down, down, down, down, down,
[16954.84s -> 16963.34s]  down, food mode off, food mode on big thing pops up on screen. You have activated food mode. Food
[16963.34s -> 16969.10s]  mode is a feature in wild hearts that tells you, well, it's the bot will take over. Uh, it can't
[16969.10s -> 16982.74s]  do certain things. And then I can press like, uh, like a combination of buttons to turn it on.
[16982.74s -> 16988.50s]  Chat is, chat is over here watching you play a game, probably eating and then calling you stupid
[16988.50s -> 16999.45s]  for doing, wanting to do the same thing. Luigi mode, but it wouldn't be Luigi mode. It would be
[16999.45s -> 17019.93s]  a, like a voluntary Luigi mode, but that's good marbles. Oh wait. Oh yeah. I'm laying in bed. I'm
[17019.93s -> 17031.30s]  drawing, but you could cheese with it. Well, no, the AI would be very bad at the game. I'm talking
[17031.30s -> 17036.42s]  like, I think about this just, hold on. I know everyone's kind of, you know, going, what the
[17036.42s -> 17043.53s]  fuck? Okay. I'm going to press on the map. This is where I want to walk to. This is my, like an
[17043.53s -> 17050.30s]  open world game, right? This is my destination. It don't go there and like walk there and on the way
[17050.30s -> 17055.62s]  pick up some fucking herbs on the ground. Right. And maybe pick up a side quest along the way.
[17055.62s -> 17058.26s]  And I'm just sitting there eating and just watching it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. This is exactly
[17058.26s -> 17073.82s]  what I would have done if I didn't have grease all over my hands. What about it? Could food mode be
[17073.82s -> 17083.69s]  millennia? I don't know. No, no. Cause all exactly. That's exactly what I mean. Food mode would not
[17083.69s -> 17088.82s]  be good enough to do very much of anything at all. It would only be good enough to traverse
[17088.82s -> 17096.25s]  terrain, to pick up items, to, to like attack and you know, move to like the area of like a quest
[17096.25s -> 17103.74s]  or something. Right. It wouldn't really be able to do, be able to do very much. That is a slothful
[17103.74s -> 17113.75s]  idea. It's not that bad. It's an auto farm tool. No, it would, but what if we had like a five,
[17113.75s -> 17121.02s]  no, how long does it take to eat? Okay. It was, you could only activate it 30 minutes a day total.
[17121.34s -> 17126.23s]  Food mode would not activate. It would say, sorry, you've already used food mode for 30 minutes.
[17126.23s -> 17151.91s]  Please come back in 24 hours when food mode is reactivated. I think I don't want any of these.
[17151.91s -> 17156.90s]  I think it's a good idea. You know, how many times I've just sat there where I was in the middle of
[17156.90s -> 17163.14s]  something, a middle of, I don't want to stop really necessarily playing the game. I would like to have
[17163.14s -> 17169.10s]  it play it for me while I just sit here for 15 to 20 minutes, not long. And maybe have it like kill
[17169.10s -> 17173.90s]  a couple of monsters or something and then like, oh cool. Oh yeah. Oh, what dropped? Oh, nice.
[17173.90s -> 17190.46s]  And then I turned to Holly and we high five each other with these greasy ass fucking hands.
[17190.46s -> 17200.34s]  Nice. Blade and soul kind of has that in some areas. It's a shit game though.
[17204.79s -> 17232.52s]  All right. Okay. Nobody likes my food mode idea. Take the file. I ate it. Take the heart.
[17232.52s -> 17237.32s]  Taking damage depletes red hearts before soul hearts. The red heart damage can lower your
[17237.32s -> 17247.10s]  devil angel room chance. Why would I want to do that? What if it was a special code from
[17247.10s -> 17250.86s]  takeout places? Like in the box, you get a QR code that gives you one hour of food mode.
[17250.86s -> 17262.15s]  That sounds pretty hype. Yeah. Like super Mario, super Mario Odyssey two.
[17264.92s -> 17274.63s]  It's with its, it's cross promotion with pizza hut. If you get a large three topping pizza,
[17274.63s -> 17278.63s]  Mario will play the game for you when you want to just sit there and have your garlic sauce
[17279.19s -> 17292.66s]  and dip it. Yeah. Fucking perfect. This is dystopia dude. Yeah. Oh,
[17299.99s -> 17303.67s]  you are encouraging the fall of Western civilization.
[17304.87s -> 17313.03s]  All because I want to be able to eat a fucking steak on the couch and have a bot play a game
[17313.03s -> 17329.91s]  for me for five minutes. I disagree. All of a Western civilization. I think it's a good idea.
[17329.91s -> 17343.06s]  Oh, I've got to hold on. Can we evolve this idea? So what if instead of the thing you all hate,
[17343.06s -> 17349.54s]  what if you press the button and the it's food mode turns on and the character sits down and
[17349.54s -> 17355.77s]  a cut scene plays and it's a, it's a long, like 10 to 15 minute long cut scene where they're
[17355.77s -> 17363.53s]  just a two or three of the characters in the game are eating at a table. And we're all eating.
[17363.53s -> 17372.28s]  We're all hanging out and eating together. I'm done. I'm done. I swear I'm done.
[17383.86s -> 17391.26s]  Oh man. It's Mar. Yeah. It's Mario and Luigi are like eating pizza and like spinach and
[17391.26s -> 17399.74s]  spaghetti and stuff. And like Mario's like, Ooh, Luigi, the sauce is phenomenal. Oh Mario,
[17399.74s -> 17405.26s]  have some of the garlic bread. Oh, what are you eating? And he looks up into the camera,
[17405.26s -> 17411.30s]  looks right at you. And then he sits there and waits for you to tell him. Oh, that sounds
[17411.30s -> 17413.54s]  Mama Mia, that sounds delicious. Oh
[17441.49s -> 17443.66s]  Pilk
[17443.94s -> 17445.58s]  Mama Mia
[17445.58s -> 17447.58s]  How do you love still?
[17447.66s -> 17458.64s]  Just to be careful. You might to get a diarrhea
[17459.40s -> 17481.82s]  But that's horrifying. That's so sad. Yeah, but you don't think that that would be funny or like interesting
[17481.82s -> 17485.70s]  I feel like I would be if I that was in a Mario game. I feel like this is so funny
[17485.70s -> 17490.26s]  This is so like cute. It's just like there's like an eating we could just like watch them
[17493.91s -> 17503.61s]  Games need food mode. I want this these are free to go in now
[17506.65s -> 17516.02s]  What is that holding the item causes non-ghost enemies to spawn small red ghosts on
[17516.72s -> 17518.00s]  death this
[17518.00s -> 17520.18s]  Like more enemies
[17520.18s -> 17536.42s]  There's a lot here. So hold on. So when I kill something it turns into a ghost the ghost hangs out
[17536.98s -> 17542.95s]  Using the item causes the ghosts over there. You blow them all up using the item also kills any ghost enemies
[17543.35s -> 17551.11s]  Wait including bosses. Wait, okay. I'm curious. I want to try it. Is it a one time?
[17551.11s -> 17566.34s]  Is it and I use it many times I want I had to take that because I wouldn't have an opportunity to
[17566.94s -> 17598.46s]  It's infinite. So how often should I use this thing? Whoa, don't wait. It's just okay. So I don't have to oh
[17601.32s -> 17611.43s]  Interesting kind of fucked. I'm not gonna lie especially in a little space like this
[17616.54s -> 17619.50s]  Okay, I'm like paying almost more attention to that than the actual game
[17620.06s -> 17651.42s]  Okay, they don't all they don't hurt you for some reason I was assuming they did the explosions hurt it might
[17652.33s -> 17654.45s]  I'm not taking this because I want to hey
[17654.45s -> 17663.20s]  I want to help you want to get a bunch of them on screen and blow them up. They don't alright
[17663.20s -> 17671.52s]  That's good to know that the explosion doesn't hurt you. They don't hurt you. I thought that they did good to know
[17671.66s -> 17705.13s]  Yeah, well, we'll wrap it up after this too. Whatever happens here. This would be the last run. They already went in there. Anyways, thank you for the speed
[17705.13s -> 17723.51s]  Oh, that's right. I turned off all spikes. I'm gonna check the secret room
[17723.69s -> 17741.41s]  Having a bomb doesn't this do something you can blow this up and it goes down or it heals fully heal. All right, good
[17743.48s -> 17753.54s]  Chaos all items are chosen from random item pulls spawns one to six random pickups wacky
[17753.56s -> 17763.26s]  Yeah, the wind has died yet. I'm glad that the card didn't come up
[17763.26s -> 17783.55s]  It's eight the other thing the other trinket. I think I'm just gonna hold it for until like a boss
[17783.87s -> 17793.15s]  It's probably the best thing to do, right? I need more
[17793.67s -> 17806.73s]  My tears are kind of bad. All right, stop talking. I'm sorry. I had to those things are awful
[17806.73s -> 17819.86s]  I feel like I'm not killing anything. Look at how slow I'm that my damage is so high too. What's going on here?
[17819.86s -> 17853.14s]  I oh
[17853.14s -> 17902.95s]  I'm a stupid person over here get over here bro turned on food mode and didn't think we'd notice
[17905.26s -> 17915.45s]  Is it chaos or is it I need heels chaos?
[17915.49s -> 17929.41s]  Ooh job breakers good and then soul of the loss turns the player into the loss allows taking one devil room item for free
[17929.41s -> 17950.60s]  That's bad humor the strutting that ass guy. Yeah strutting that ass strutting that ass
[17951.12s -> 17957.69s]  You get you walk to gutters. You're gonna be so fucking tired. You wouldn't be strutting that ass
[17957.97s -> 17967.80s]  Why don't you walk to good? Why don't you walk to good? I don't want to walk to go
[17967.80s -> 17986.02s]  Oh, why don't you walk to good? Of course, I've seen it before who is he?
[17986.02s -> 17990.18s]  What are you talking about? What? All right, if you don't know what that is, then I do sound
[17991.18s -> 18024.01s]  Ridiculous right now. It's a it's a video. It's like an old meme video. I go in it's a boomer meme
[18024.45s -> 18038.01s]  Somebody asked and I answered that sounds cool
[18038.61s -> 18052.63s]  Things pretty cool, right? You gave a whole performance. I
[18055.09s -> 18062.54s]  Mean, I've just ever I remembered the video could have had it for free
[18062.54s -> 18068.29s]  But when I turned to the loss doesn't it mess up my whole character gives me like three soul hearts
[18068.45s -> 18080.56s]  No, I can I die in one hit or something right it's one room it was temporary. Oh, well then I'll take it
[18090.00s -> 18093.47s]  Holy shit that item is really good. Oh
[18095.80s -> 18100.20s]  Come on that item is unbelievable. Stop doing that to me. Oh
[18102.71s -> 18149.32s]  Thank you worst item in the game. I'll take this though. This is really good. This is pretty good, too
[18166.64s -> 18179.21s]  I really don't want to do this but I'm gonna okay. There's a thing. Oh, yeah
[18181.81s -> 18201.32s]  Does that button ever do anything good? I feel like every time I press that bad things happen in this room
[18201.32s -> 18207.76s]  I've never had a good thing happen when I press one of those in the breed shop. It's like almost never
[18219.28s -> 18243.40s]  Mmm, I think I'm good to go by the $5 one. Why would you buy this 50% chance to explode? No, thank you
[18251.34s -> 18255.60s]  Salvation almost just walked into the
[18256.38s -> 18278.97s]  Bad technique. All right, let's go. What happened to my item. What's going on? I'm fucking confused. What happened? What happened? What's going on?
[18278.97s -> 18291.26s]  This is rerolling enemies. Wait this stupid thing that I picked up who told me to pick this up
[18291.36s -> 18298.40s]  Who told me to pick this up? It's this is on you. This is on you. Why did you tell me to pick this up?
[18298.40s -> 18304.52s]  I thought that was it. Oh, no. Oh
[18306.57s -> 18310.63s]  No, this would be this was that was gonna be so good for super greed
[18311.41s -> 18314.63s]  Because of all the shit that he spawns. Oh, no
[18315.25s -> 18319.03s]  Why did I listen you?
[18320.03s -> 18332.54s]  You've rerolled it I don't know I just let me read it this is not an okay active item is top-left
[18333.54s -> 18339.71s]  Consumable is bottom right? I might as well just reroll it but I can't use it anymore, right?
[18339.79s -> 18357.83s]  You'd only listen to me. I have 600 hours in this game. You need a key. I need a key
[18357.99s -> 18367.94s]  All right, I need a key. I need a key name somebody on this fucking website that can do a barbarian like that
[18368.10s -> 18395.36s]  Uh, I think it's okay little neff. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. I agree
[18395.36s -> 18417.68s]  Let's do it again. Can that in this stack if I stand right next somebody can it be like
[18419.32s -> 18425.04s]  It's really good you do that again and hit me again. I'm gonna scream
[18427.12s -> 18446.75s]  Internally, okay. So here we go. So you're telling me that if I use this I get this for free
[18446.91s -> 18464.48s]  You have chaos. Yeah, don't use it
[18464.48s -> 18473.24s]  Oh, but what if I go I'm I don't all right get this shit out of here
[18473.24s -> 18475.32s]  So if I do this now
[18475.32s -> 18477.40s]  Well, will I actually can I still do it?
[18477.40s -> 18482.68s]  No, is it because chaos really mess everything up the flush thing would be kind of good for the next room or two
[18483.00s -> 18492.18s]  Just wait for everything to spawn and turn everything to shit and flush it these items suck
[18493.98s -> 18501.62s]  Chaos made all the items. Oh, that's right. I'm doing it
[18504.83s -> 18508.96s]  That's free
[18508.96s -> 18527.17s]  Yeah, okay. I have flight now too. I want this shield of tears. It just really good
[18527.29s -> 18539.46s]  I'm gonna buy another heart too. Are you gonna see the Mario movie? Oh, yeah, absolutely
[18540.22s -> 18550.86s]  another judgment
[18550.86s -> 18553.39s]  Judgment god damn it fine
[18553.99s -> 18569.23s]  What? Oh, it's an item from the current rooms item pool
[18569.75s -> 18575.80s]  So I go into the stop the store and do that. It's one heart container. Okay, that's fine
[18576.50s -> 18595.96s]  Okay shit. Okay, robo, baby
[18596.70s -> 18602.99s]  All right shit. I've I got to greedy. It's all right. I have the toilet thing. I can plunge
[18603.23s -> 18628.08s]  Why would I do that? I don't know. What about secret room? I could probably find it the right the left
[18632.80s -> 18641.95s]  Bottom. Hey the runs over do just drink some Ramune on stream and call it a night
[18642.67s -> 18651.06s]  You might be right. All right, we're good arts arts in here
[18658.46s -> 18660.77s]  Her new room
[18660.81s -> 18668.01s]  You're gonna single use a dice consumable item. The dice disappears when leaving the dice does not take up a pill slot
[18669.01s -> 18689.17s]  Okay, blow up the reroll machine, I don't think I want to do that now that that's not gonna do anything for me
[18689.69s -> 18693.21s]  All right. Let's go
[18693.33s -> 18711.56s]  Let's go quietly. It's late. What's the d12? It's the eternal d6. Holy shit
[18711.56s -> 18727.67s]  Give me that do the d6 in the shop like right now. Whoa
[18728.31s -> 18740.50s]  Okay
[18740.50s -> 18749.38s]  What is the eternal d6 online? I'm a little good. I need to look at my whole loadout. How do I drop everything?
[18749.38s -> 18757.94s]  I'm holding down right trigger the curse room
[18757.98s -> 18764.45s]  Yeah, I just what the fuck I want that person timed out for a hundred hours
[18764.49s -> 18785.90s]  How did I get hurt you immediately do everything one guy tells you not true. What is my item? What's going on?
[18786.10s -> 18797.43s]  Would my item go what happened to the thing that I just did just turned into it. Did it explode read it read what?
[18807.01s -> 18809.01s]  Damn it. It's
[18810.89s -> 18828.86s]  Fuck man, that's like I don't I'll be alright. We're good. We're good. We're good. Everybody relax watch this
[18828.94s -> 18853.95s]  Why they're not all flushed? Why is it not everybody's still here? Oh
[18858.60s -> 18878.34s]  No, it didn't work the way I thought it was gonna work that jump was fucking stupid this game
[18878.34s -> 18888.46s]  I just got I don't know. I'm tired. I fucked it up. I'm tired
[18888.66s -> 18893.28s]  God damn it one more one more and I'm gonna try as hard as I can
[18893.28s -> 18901.11s]  It all went to shit when I picked up that stupid bag of whatever it is
[18901.23s -> 18923.41s]  What is this enemy kill drop red half hearts that despair after two seconds? I don't know if you gamble on greedier
[18923.41s -> 18937.83s]  That's probably a bad idea. All right, this is actually the one I'm going to really try and I'm gonna pay attention
[18937.83s -> 18942.40s]  We're not gonna have a food mode notice when we started talking about food mode
[18943.92s -> 19047.12s]  The gaming skill dropped by like 70% its game. I'm here. That's better. There we go clean dish
[19047.12s -> 19086.00s]  Oh what no, it was such a bad placement
[19086.64s -> 19089.08s]  Stop talking me. I can't play and talk at the same time
[19089.12s -> 19113.98s]  What we got sometimes burst out of the ground and grabs an enemy levitates in front of Isaac deals damage
[19114.22s -> 19139.01s]  Isaac's damage six times per second. This is good, too. Well, let's find out what's in here ghost bombs
[19139.09s -> 19146.45s]  How do we know you're not eating right now?
[19146.81s -> 19151.61s]  Now I was thinking about just queuing up a bunch of crunching sounds on YouTube or something and just playing and being quiet
[19151.89s -> 19172.50s]  But it's too much for me right now. I kind of this is kind of cool. This is way more practical
[19172.98s -> 19186.31s]  I'm gonna do it. I know it's the I'm doing the lame thing, but I want to stay alive. Does this hurt me?
[19186.55s -> 19201.83s]  Plus the two kids that's ten cents that I'm not gonna have to spend. That's good
[19227.09s -> 19239.92s]  I'm not going in it. What's this game about? It's about killing things attacking upgrading
[19240.72s -> 19249.04s]  Random die do it again win do it again
[19256.47s -> 19260.43s]  Okay, let's go and I'm gonna activate that
[19261.63s -> 19286.53s]  Magdalene thing or a boros worm. Nope panic button. No, that's bad, too
[19287.17s -> 19300.90s]  Taking damage uses the active item if it's charged. Why would I want that? How many seconds behind him? I read this
[19302.89s -> 19305.69s]  Well, here's the good way to do it so
[19307.05s -> 19309.61s]  That's an interesting experiment. I like the experiment you want to do
[19310.17s -> 19316.49s]  You do this experiment is I clap and then you say clap the second that you hear clap and I'll tell you
[19316.49s -> 19320.20s]  I'll give you the exact time ready. Don't do it yet
[19320.88s -> 19323.52s]  No, no, no, don't do it yet. I didn't do it yet. Don't do it yet
[19329.66s -> 19335.87s]  dog five seconds
[19336.90s -> 19344.18s]  So I said dog and then five seconds went by and it was over in chat. So if you're ever wondering
[19344.82s -> 19349.58s]  Like wow, I can't believe how does he not we told him to go left, but he went right
[19350.10s -> 19353.78s]  Because when I went right it took five seconds for you to tell me to go left
[19353.78s -> 19373.58s]  So you like we we were always miscommunicating by five seconds. What does this tell it? Wow, that's pretty good for three seconds
[19373.62s -> 19396.53s]  It's a lot my favorite thing here. Is this working greed mode? That's amazing
[19396.53s -> 19407.32s]  All right, I actually have to really I don't I don't want to lose this looks like this great items here low latency
[19407.32s -> 19413.06s]  I I think I have low latency turned on the second that that feature was available. I turned it on
[19413.06s -> 19422.09s]  I think it really depends on distance as well for a lot of people
[19422.89s -> 19426.96s]  Some people I think have it pretty low
[19427.64s -> 19432.56s]  It actually is like three or four seconds for you, but it might be like eight seconds for somebody else, right?
[19433.32s -> 19454.59s]  Probably not even playing is probably going through a whole bag of corn nuts
[19456.16s -> 19483.52s]  These things are annoying
[19483.52s -> 19486.56s]  Thankfully, I will probably never get hit by a projectile ever again. Oh
[19497.07s -> 19499.07s]  I'm sorry. I freaked out cuz I forgot that the
[19499.79s -> 19504.55s]  I'm sorry. I let me let me let me just get my sparrings here for a second
[19505.07s -> 19510.85s]  The hearts are disappearing and I forgot that that was part of that item and I just like was like what the fuck's happening
[19511.29s -> 19522.62s]  What he leads her in this room?
[19523.06s -> 19529.05s]  Get out of my I'm so mad. We'll get out of the fucking way. What the hell?
[19529.65s -> 19534.50s]  It's like every enemy that spawns was an elite and that those two big fat guys just blocking my way
[19534.86s -> 19539.36s]  It was like seven it was six elites in the room
[19540.12s -> 19547.74s]  Last one. I forgot how much greedier was just like a fucking painful
[19548.24s -> 19554.83s]  You can't kill those mother. Oh
[19555.31s -> 19608.13s]  All right, last one nice my question mark. I'm trying to build up my damage lucky. Okay, that's it Max, right?
[19608.13s -> 19669.33s]  Yeah, Northern Lion collab when I mean, I don't know. I wasn't lines really cool, dude
[19670.86s -> 19678.79s]  The way that I feel about collabs like you guys know just whatever like sometimes it just like happens. Sometimes it doesn't sometimes it does I
[19679.19s -> 19691.20s]  Would play something with no in line hundred percent. All right
[19692.32s -> 19709.84s]  Remember do you have an agent? I do have an agency. Yes, I am under evolved. I have an agent
[19709.84s -> 19729.91s]  I have a manager. I don't really talk too much about them or about it. But yes, I do do that damage. No
[19730.55s -> 19746.67s]  All right. Let's try really hard. I just absolutely
[19747.67s -> 19756.88s]  Dissolve that person. All right, don't go in it. What do we got the stew is it's just gonna make me lose
[19756.92s -> 19778.20s]  I think what about an army of lawyers? I do have lawyers. I do I take the stew just go fast
[19778.44s -> 19802.08s]  Okay, but let me get everything else. I need to heart or a key. I'll be full health, right?
[19802.08s -> 19807.90s]  I think it's full health because I'll be able to get when I steamroll everybody
[19807.90s -> 19826.13s]  I freaked out cuz I saw the chest this worst thing to start with. Come on, man
[19826.45s -> 19908.74s]  Only I had tears up so much better timers going up though. This is a good thing. Okay. Oh nice. Nice. Nice
[19908.86s -> 19919.62s]  What is this picking up soul heart grants a random permanent stat? Oh, yep hurry I
[19920.66s -> 19925.12s]  What is that? What is this? What is this? I'm gonna pause it. What is that on the corner that thing? What is that?
[19925.32s -> 19937.06s]  I've never seen that before. It does nothing for you. Okay, it's a holy version of the devil, baby
[19938.51s -> 19940.51s]  Okay, it's not worth it. Okay
[19940.79s -> 19943.29s]  I'm gonna just go buy stuff very fast
[19944.68s -> 19946.98s]  Key, this is a
[19948.46s -> 19954.58s]  Wait, there's a free key. Let's not buy one. Um, what do I buy? What do I buy?
[19954.58s -> 19966.54s]  What do I buy? What do I buy? What do I buy? Go quick. Hurry. What is that? I don't know all stats up. Oh
[19967.26s -> 19973.53s]  Don't shit the Sun two flubs
[19974.05s -> 19981.19s]  The Joker. Um, take a couple of hearts. It's mommy something good. Alright, fuck off
[19982.66s -> 19996.07s]  Joker no, I didn't mean to cool nice panic equals power. I don't know what that just does. Does it do oops
[19996.07s -> 20000.14s]  I didn't I honestly did not press that fucking button. I swear to God
[20000.18s -> 20003.63s]  Why would you why would I have right like why would I have pressed it?
[20003.75s -> 20008.98s]  They said there's no reason why you would have it was it I leaned it against my fucking thigh
[20009.42s -> 20069.89s]  And it hold on go tinted fucking rock. I can build it up. I can build it back up. Look shit
[20070.73s -> 20072.73s]  Forest fucking enemies to have right now
[20102.54s -> 20132.51s]  Get out of here open open
[20141.78s -> 20159.53s]  Free soul hearts. Oh, yeah, this is awesome. I'm gonna get permanent stat upgrades for this. Oh, yeah
[20164.90s -> 20172.46s]  Um
[20172.46s -> 20189.27s]  Okay, good. I think it's over. Yeah firing a coin tier costs one coin
[20189.55s -> 20200.01s]  Every 20 tears you shoot a coin tear and he's hit with the coin turn into gold
[20200.53s -> 20217.81s]  I'm gonna miss this a lot. I imagine it could be good, but it could be bad. I'll try it
[20218.05s -> 20223.80s]  Why not every 20 shots does it keep track? 1 2 3 4 5
[20224.44s -> 20228.06s]  6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
[20228.58s -> 20235.56s]  That wasn't 20. It was 15
[20239.52s -> 20241.32s]  Okay, um
[20241.32s -> 20245.46s]  That soul of Eve
[20245.50s -> 20248.46s]  14 dead bird familiars fly in and attack enemies
[20249.14s -> 20258.43s]  Take that for the greed fight
[20258.43s -> 20260.93s]  Good for final boss. Yeah
[20261.17s -> 20264.63s]  Bad I have to lose the card
[20264.63s -> 20282.57s]  All right, let's go. I have a key still. Yeah. All right, let's go by a soul heart
[20284.34s -> 20286.34s]  Mmm, I want to save the money
[20289.42s -> 20291.58s]  Random coin every two rooms. That's great. Oh
[20292.62s -> 20294.10s]  God damn it
[20294.10s -> 20322.35s]  Go hearts. Oh
[20322.63s -> 20338.22s]  Um, whatever god damn it I I worked there's no way anyone's gonna count that I just hope it hits somebody
[20338.98s -> 20377.49s]  Geez, I might I might be at a net negative right now with that. I'm just losing money
[20378.01s -> 20434.93s]  What's hitting me? Stop? I have the coins to collect of my relationships been fantastic
[20434.93s -> 20447.65s]  You mean like all like all around everything's great. Why are you shooting cuz it's I just do it weird question
[20447.65s -> 20457.42s]  Yeah, whatever. Okay, this is important
[20460.58s -> 20486.02s]  Re-rolls pedestal items, which already already already bought them, but I'll use the soul of Eve though. Oh, no, is it?
[20486.02s -> 20509.48s]  Oh, okay. I don't really want the book but on the random trinket while hell doubles the trinket effect
[20509.48s -> 20528.99s]  Oh, I'm gonna do that. Yeah, nice. Okay has be completely uncharged active item. Stop shooting
[20539.04s -> 20546.83s]  Duplicates one pickup in the room d100. No, I don't want that
[20547.03s -> 20560.28s]  Doesn't this double while hell doubles trinket effects shouldn't this be I shouldn't have more
[20560.76s -> 20575.34s]  On the bulb, right? Yeah, but d6 to be honest d100
[20575.34s -> 20584.52s]  Let's gamble this shit use the d100 in this room. That's so bad
[20587.54s -> 20608.53s]  D100 will give you infinite coins. Yeah, it restarts the room time to break the game use it in the shop
[20608.53s -> 20622.49s]  I'll see you guys later. This is nice hanging out with you
[20624.32s -> 20632.88s]  To
[20633.48s -> 20635.72s]  Bismol this is a
[20635.72s -> 20650.29s]  Bismol I don't want that. Okay, so we got the backpack
[20654.89s -> 20664.88s]  extra active item two trinkets worm
[20665.24s -> 20685.03s]  Trap door and then this thing extension cord. I have way I have familiars. Whoa
[20685.55s -> 20691.14s]  This is actually pretty cool. Is it worth it to have this and just kind of run around and hope I kill stuff
[20691.14s -> 20699.90s]  I mean the stat increases much more important. He will literally do anything you tell him
[20699.90s -> 20710.46s]  Well, I mean it is like three o'clock in the morning here, I think I'm a little more I'd say relaxed
[20710.46s -> 20733.90s]  I'll keep them both. Well, might as well do it again, but doesn't really roll the room with some damage up
[20733.90s -> 20743.24s]  This is actually not terrible, but I need damage up before it's over. I mean it might even be over right now
[20743.52s -> 20780.72s]  Yeah, hey EU. Good morning EU. We're having a good breakfast. What are you got? What's it? What's a European breakfast like cigarettes and toast?
[20780.72s -> 20794.79s]  Did I just read that wrong?
[20794.95s -> 20799.32s]  Soy milk is so bad. I don't think is this even soy milk?
[20799.32s -> 20806.72s]  I think so milk is even faster than soy milk is great too, isn't it?
[20807.24s -> 20840.45s]  Sad. Oh, it's not like the build I had before was really fantastic. It was okay. I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose
[20841.05s -> 20845.19s]  To the fucking Larry whatever Larry jr. 2.0
[20845.85s -> 20875.35s]  God really? Thank God. What can I do to save this divorce papers?
[20875.35s -> 20890.79s]  No, this stuff is even worse. That's the red poop with half a heart to get full HP. Oh, yeah
[20890.79s -> 20901.67s]  I forgot about that bomb reroll use the d100 again
[20901.67s -> 20916.01s]  Um, there's no battery pack reroll for a battery and then
[20916.57s -> 20941.53s]  The whole thing. All right, fine. That's actually a smart idea. Damn it. No batteries damage up
[20941.53s -> 20961.54s]  Wait on the machine. Well now I can't reroll it again. Well, I was gonna run out of money. What just happened to me
[20961.54s -> 20968.60s]  All right. I have an idea. Here's my idea
[20968.76s -> 20984.70s]  I'm gonna get to greed and I'm gonna use I'm gonna get to greed and I'm gonna use the
[20985.18s -> 20999.40s]  Shit on the ground and just teleport out put that in the war spot. What is he doing? What are they doing?
[20999.72s -> 21019.54s]  Use the shovel now. Um shovel doesn't do anything at greed. Uh
[21020.10s -> 21036.49s]  You shovel on gems. Yeah, it'll spawn if I put it. Okay, let's see what happens. Nice
[21038.06s -> 21048.34s]  Only friend this may have just saved everything because I can just go like this and fucking move up and down and just scan
[21048.34s -> 21059.21s]  I'm like a goddamn fax machine. You know what i'm saying? Just go like this and just go
[21063.14s -> 21098.10s]  I hate this i'm gonna heal. I didn't realize that that was stem cells. Well, might as well go all in holy shit
[21098.10s -> 21105.70s]  This is cracked out. This is actually insane. This could have actually saved everything. I'm okay. Relax
[21106.02s -> 21126.12s]  Is it cracked out? Why was it doing? No, never mind. Yeah, never mind. What was doing that much damage this thing here then?
[21126.28s -> 21136.87s]  Yeah contact damage from this. It's amazing
[21145.50s -> 21150.98s]  Hmm out of my way
[21151.06s -> 21154.66s]  Not bad. Yeah, not that great. Whatever. It's all right. I'm just i'm just playing for fun
[21154.66s -> 21171.83s]  Anyways, it's not like a cure that that that that that that that that much random direction
[21173.38s -> 21175.46s]  And then one bone heart three red hearts
[21178.94s -> 21180.62s]  Oh
[21180.62s -> 21196.23s]  Back in action. Do I have anything that does this?
[21201.40s -> 21210.73s]  homing shots to all familiars do the d100 again, I will after this
[21211.45s -> 21225.22s]  I'll let me i'll do this. This is such a mess
[21226.62s -> 21232.42s]  I don't even I I don't even know where i'm shooting. It seems to be working
[21244.15s -> 21262.98s]  Not bad. Actually, i'm not rerolling this. This actually is kind of good. This could be going way worse and you all know it
[21263.14s -> 21269.16s]  Fuck up range down. Who cares?
[21273.08s -> 21275.88s]  Tower wait, what's this? What's the improved tower do?
[21276.44s -> 21282.50s]  It spawns six clusters of random rocks and obstacles
[21283.14s -> 21287.67s]  That's pretty cool
[21287.67s -> 21295.96s]  Holy shit
[21295.96s -> 21297.96s]  Um, no tinted rocks though, right?
[21304.89s -> 21322.14s]  none
[21322.14s -> 21325.91s]  uh
[21325.91s -> 21327.51s]  How is he still alive?
[21337.56s -> 21339.74s]  Do these stupid floating heads?
[21339.74s -> 21345.29s]  Why are they still here?
[21345.29s -> 21347.21s]  This build sucks
[21347.21s -> 21348.97s]  Well, I didn't make this build on my own
[21348.97s -> 21356.55s]  I listened to one person that told me to reroll every single object. Wait, this is gonna is it? Hold on
[21357.43s -> 21359.75s]  But this it's kind of working
[21382.55s -> 21384.55s]  What the fuck was that?
[21385.46s -> 21387.46s]  What just came out of my eyes?
[21388.68s -> 21396.26s]  Ow, dude, I the text on the screen is making it hard to see
[21402.04s -> 21405.00s]  What the fuck is happening? Oh my god
[21406.36s -> 21437.56s]  Dude, can we please charge bar? Hold on a minute. What is going on? Is that 1.8 damage or is it good?
[21437.88s -> 21451.74s]  I don't want to do that. I mean i'm rerolling this shit. I'll take that give me all stats up
[21451.98s -> 21470.28s]  So confused right now, but whatever it's all good. I'm going to use this right now
[21473.54s -> 21524.23s]  Nice 2.6. Oh the knife the knife hurts a lot. Not really. Yeah, this thing's stinging and anything save this
[21527.37s -> 21538.58s]  I imagine not really dude. Do you know what actually could actually save this?
[21544.17s -> 21550.41s]  The just the dead birds and just avoiding greed the whole time just running away and dodging and they'll just kill them
[21551.54s -> 21580.41s]  That's the plan. Let's go. I can't take two. Wait, I can do this though one guy. That's a good item
[21580.41s -> 21582.73s]  But it's how is it gonna not gonna shoot at anything?
[21585.22s -> 21588.94s]  Okay, cool. I'm ready
[21590.81s -> 21595.29s]  I've got my soul of eve. I just have to make it through the next area which good
[21596.09s -> 21600.68s]  That's not bad either. But what is it gonna poison?
[21602.30s -> 21637.43s]  Whatever. Let's go
[21637.43s -> 21642.07s]  That's kind of funny because I get I I might just will I be able to reroll during greed like end time
[21642.31s -> 21655.37s]  All right. Wish me luck. I have no damage. I literally do nothing. It's gonna be impossible, but whatever
[21674.87s -> 21681.27s]  22 damage. I have 22 damage now. Oh, everybody relax everybody relax. I have a shitload of damage now
[21688.92s -> 21692.28s]  22 damage
[21692.28s -> 21695.16s]  All right. All right. All right. I think I did it. I think i'm good
[21695.56s -> 21699.32s]  I don't even know what I have what items these are but this could be this could be legit
[21703.77s -> 21706.81s]  The shot speed is so slow. Look at this
[21707.69s -> 21709.69s]  My tears are so low
[21709.93s -> 21713.70s]  What else is alive?
[21713.70s -> 21744.86s]  Something else alive?
[21744.86s -> 21749.29s]  Get out of my way. My goodness
[21750.01s -> 21757.62s]  I think it's spectral tears
[21780.28s -> 21801.38s]  Oh my goodness gracious. Nice lot. Oh

[21829.77s -> 21840.22s]  This is huge. This is actually huge. What should I do now bomb reset? Good idea
[21858.12s -> 21860.94s]  Rainworm, okay
[21860.94s -> 21880.41s]  This might actually work. Oh two trinkets. All right. Yeah, I I think i'm good
[21880.57s -> 21887.74s]  I just have to be careful during ultra greed just hope that the birds can help kill him too and it should be good to go
[21887.90s -> 21908.76s]  Please shit. Thanks
[21908.76s -> 21975.18s]  Jesus stop spawning shit. Fuck off. Come on. This is like this jerk

[21983.13s -> 21995.21s]  How come you're not showing your items? Uh, because strange snipers. I wanted to see what I have
[22018.06s -> 22032.06s]  So this is like kind of crazy, right? Bones of random pickup
[22032.54s -> 22054.01s]  This is a pogged item damage and tears up. Holy shit. All right, i'm ready. So let's go i'm buying

[22532.09s -> 22534.09s]  Wow, that run was thrown away
[22534.70s -> 22544.82s]  Brought out of the trash thrown away again, and then I got like 40 items. I don't even know what I was getting
[22545.14s -> 22556.66s]  Let's see there's an extra hud like I don't even know carried by d 100
[22556.90s -> 22563.59s]  Well, the d 100 ruined it and then made it better again. Look at all this shit that's around me too

[22592.66s -> 22600.47s]  Yeah, that's fun. I think when I played grittier all the time
[22600.71s -> 22605.69s]  I want to say it was like a probably like a 20 or 30 percent win rate
[22605.93s -> 22619.78s]  Grittier actually is a huge pain in the ass unless you something like that happens, honestly, and that's it
[22620.10s -> 22643.86s]  I guess i'm asleep. Oh my god. I had a moment. That was really fun. Thanks for chilling out and dave

[22673.59s -> 22676.87s]  I have to imagine that pacific na is probably very tired
[22678.10s -> 22680.34s]  and central and east coast na
[22681.46s -> 22686.12s]  Are already asleep right now

[22723.69s -> 22726.73s]  Let's see what it looks like on thursday friday
[22728.47s -> 22730.07s]  I have a couple of things
[22730.07s -> 22732.31s]  Very important to take care of for grotto beasts
[22733.56s -> 22736.52s]  Because grotto beasts is very very close
[22738.84s -> 22741.24s]  There are a lot of things that still have to be kind of situated
[22741.88s -> 22746.58s]  Because obviously the launch of grotto beasts is
[22747.54s -> 22752.81s]  Very very soon when I made that I made talked about it on the discord
[22753.05s -> 22755.21s]  Talked about a little bit a couple weeks ago three weeks ago or so
[22756.01s -> 22758.25s]  Still trying to shoot for that end of february
[22760.42s -> 22761.86s]  And if it's not
[22761.86s -> 22765.38s]  The end of february then it'll be literally like within a day or two later
[22765.94s -> 22768.52s]  We'll get you a hard date
[22768.52s -> 22771.72s]  Tons of info is going to come out tons of things that we can talk about
[22774.57s -> 22778.10s]  Should be really really fun a lot of time a lot of work went into it
[22779.30s -> 22783.14s]  Um, it's kind of the project that took the place of a
[22784.52s -> 22791.18s]  I guess like an event stream
[22791.18s -> 22797.83s]  No way already. Yeah, but what is the end of february? Well, it's still about six or seven more days
[22799.69s -> 22800.89s]  six more days
[22800.89s -> 22805.24s]  What I also told you guys do that this year
[22806.41s -> 22809.42s]  This year's a lot of
[22809.42s -> 22811.18s]  more of this
[22811.18s -> 22814.36s]  Way more of this
[22814.36s -> 22816.76s]  And this new philosophy that I have for the channel
[22819.43s -> 22821.43s]  I think i've streamed way more
[22822.26s -> 22824.42s]  By just being like, you know what?
[22824.42s -> 22829.14s]  It's eight o'clock at night. Let's go. I'm gonna just do anything. It doesn't matter what it is
[22840.49s -> 22842.97s]  And this is the stuff that makes me happy
[22843.70s -> 22852.68s]  So i'm gonna keep doing it
[22852.68s -> 22854.68s]  That's how gamers should be
[22856.82s -> 22860.34s]  But yeah, thanks for sticking around kind of an impromptu late night stream
[22861.40s -> 22863.00s]  I'll see you guys in a couple days
[22863.00s -> 22866.68s]  Maybe a day or two. I don't know. We'll see. I who knows over the next two days
[22866.68s -> 22869.75s]  If I just might just turn it on again
[22869.75s -> 22871.75s]  Breath of the wild is something I really actually do want to do
[22873.03s -> 22876.71s]  Imagine you'll see that frog detective has to happen before the end of february
[22877.35s -> 22879.83s]  What did I say? I was gonna like delete my twitch channel or something if I don't
[22880.39s -> 22884.60s]  it's like hooper, uh
[22885.70s -> 22887.86s]  Will probably be played within the next six to 12 months
[22888.58s -> 22890.58s]  So yeah, I mean there's lots of things to do
[22895.70s -> 22897.53s]  All right, everybody
[22897.53s -> 22906.50s]  I will see you later
[22906.50s -> 22910.39s]  Take care of yourselves get some sleep if you are still up
[22911.90s -> 22913.90s]  Or you know what do whatever do whatever you want
[22914.54s -> 22917.90s]  You do whatever you feel like it's your life. It's not mine
[22918.46s -> 22922.84s]  I'm not going to tell you what to do with yours exactly how I expect you not to tell me what to do with mine
[22923.08s -> 22929.48s]  Just take care of yourself
[22929.48s -> 22931.77s]  Have a great one
[22931.77s -> 22937.06s]  And definitely look out for grotto beast info. It's gonna be a big deal. That's all i'm saying
[22938.25s -> 22941.96s]  Some of the stuff we got cooking
[22941.96s -> 22945.58s]  Just it's I cannot wait for you to see it. That's all i'm gonna say
[22967.21s -> 22970.17s]  We're never gonna see him again. I just I told you i'll be back in like two days
[22970.49s -> 22983.88s]  Hey, my mother wants more info. When can we expect sorcery?
[22985.85s -> 22990.55s]  Uh, she said she has no faith in your wait a little longer excuse
[22994.44s -> 22995.16s]  Yeah
[22995.16s -> 22997.78s]  No, that's a mother. All right. Yep
[22999.26s -> 23003.72s]  That's a mother
[23003.72s -> 23007.19s]  After breath of the wild, I think I want to finish that first
[23007.75s -> 23025.14s]  Yeah, I still want to do the hitman stuff
[23025.14s -> 23031.46s]  I finished sorcery three times in a row after seeing you play it. That's awesome because it's
[23032.18s -> 23042.42s]  One of the best games ever made
[23042.42s -> 23045.50s]  Any new weird dreams?
[23045.50s -> 23047.46s]  um
[23047.46s -> 23049.62s]  Not that I can really recall that were that interesting
[23050.10s -> 23056.57s]  Hold on. Let me just manually turn this down
[23056.89s -> 23070.54s]  There we go. Nice and slow. There it is. Good night guys. Be good
[23071.18s -> 23072.30s]  Be well

[23086.65s -> 23090.92s]  See you later
[23090.92s -> 23092.44s]  Call your mother
[23092.44s -> 23093.88s]  Not right now
[23093.88s -> 23097.66s]  In a more reasonable hour
[23097.66s -> 23101.94s]  See you later
