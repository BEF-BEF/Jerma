[69.99s -> 71.59s]  This is going to be
[71.59s -> 73.59s]  Sort of like the thing we did last year
[76.26s -> 77.38s]  if
[77.38s -> 79.24s]  You remember that
[79.24s -> 80.12s]  we

[98.41s -> 100.41s]  half the categories
[100.49s -> 102.49s]  Uh, the half the categories are

[501.75s -> 504.62s]  There's nothing else here
[504.62s -> 505.82s]  so I

[511.90s -> 513.90s]  I thought there's no room for a printer
[514.71s -> 519.11s]  Get a larger desk. This is one of the biggest desks you could buy but what before it being a pain in the ass
[520.36s -> 522.52s]  This is like 72 inches long and like
[523.40s -> 525.40s]  like 60 inches wide

[977.50s -> 981.90s]  In fact, this plastic bag is so destructive to the environment that if you really care about the future
[982.22s -> 986.78s]  You could seriously just reuse paper bags from here on out. This bag is not a toy
[987.82s -> 991.66s]  Don't be an accessory to make the 100 billion plastic bags in the u.s

[1114.40s -> 1117.36s]  On the internet where nothing is real

[2379.42s -> 2381.31s]  anyways
[2381.31s -> 2383.31s]  Here are the nominees for best
[2384.27s -> 2386.53s]  Otto's my dog if you don't know and
[2387.33s -> 2389.57s]  sometimes he shows up on stream and these are
[2390.37s -> 2392.37s]  This was not supposed to be a category, but it is
[2393.60s -> 2397.79s]  For some reason you have a dog. Yeah, I mean there's eight thousand people here
[2398.59s -> 2402.27s]  Best auto moment that could be like that could be like somebody that lives down the street
[2403.70s -> 2406.58s]  If you've never been here before so
[2408.35s -> 2410.35s]  Over I know I I showed him already
[2410.43s -> 2418.40s]  Where is he? Oh, he's blending in with the with the blanket. All right, the nominees for best auto moment are
[2430.90s -> 2434.90s]  Okay, all the twos are done. So this these are both forwards. So this has to be like this
[2436.16s -> 2442.02s]  What the fuck is that?
[2442.02s -> 2445.89s]  Why is this playing?
[2445.89s -> 2452.93s]  Why is this playing?
[2454.05s -> 2456.05s]  Is this supposed to be distraction?
[2462.50s -> 2467.92s]  Did I do that right? Oh, this is playing the whole video or this
[2470.34s -> 2472.82s]  That's it. It's just doing the video. Okay
[2474.85s -> 2480.62s]  three
[2480.62s -> 2488.91s]  Okay. Oh wait, can you show a dog shitting on stream? This is no you can't right? It's not inspired three one
[2490.27s -> 2492.27s]  Three three one three
[2494.67s -> 2497.79s]  Three three one three four four
[2498.11s -> 2502.21s]  One four four three one three three
[2503.33s -> 2512.42s]  There's too many sounds
[2512.42s -> 2521.95s]  You asked for it all night
[2522.03s -> 2525.07s]  There you see there's the dog. Where's the auto?
[2528.72s -> 2530.72s]  See you guys woke him up to do this shit
[2532.99s -> 2538.35s]  There you go, there's our toe look at how tired he is
[2538.99s -> 2542.06s]  Okay, put him to bed. Well, he belongs in bed
[2542.78s -> 2553.81s]  That's not that's my that's not a paid actor. That's my girlfriend. Good night. Just like that dog
[2554.67s -> 2556.43s]  Doggy like babies
[2556.43s -> 2564.69s]  maybe just like
[2564.69s -> 2566.62s]  That was cute
[2566.62s -> 2569.09s]  see
[2569.09s -> 2572.05s]  He's too perfect for this world. He is fancy. He's so good
[2572.85s -> 2574.85s]  He really is he's like the best dog ever
[2575.25s -> 2576.69s]  He is eight
[2576.69s -> 2578.77s]  He's eight years old. He's fantastic. I love him
[2579.49s -> 2586.86s]  Hey, I don't
[2586.86s -> 2589.02s]  Hello, that's just a clip right behind me
[2590.14s -> 2597.22s]  This category sucks. I was I was bullied into putting this in. I was bullied into putting this in
[2598.02s -> 2603.92s]  Yeah, it's me
[2603.92s -> 2610.42s]  He's like, what are you doing?
[2610.42s -> 2611.78s]  There you go
[2611.78s -> 2613.78s]  Auto spotted. This is just what he does guy
[2615.46s -> 2629.26s]  Hey
[2629.26s -> 2636.02s]  Hey, hey, what are you doing? This is sad. This is a sad song. Are you napping in here?
[2636.82s -> 2638.10s]  No, it's not
[2638.10s -> 2643.63s]  Look at that tail ready. Hey, thanks for the subs by the way. Hey
[2644.35s -> 2647.01s]  What are you doing?
[2647.01s -> 2649.01s]  Uh glucose amino chondroitin
[2650.06s -> 2652.06s]  Oh, what do I do? What do I get?
[2652.78s -> 2663.07s]  Uh, yes if you um
[2664.03s -> 2670.53s]  When your dog only shows up four times on stream you have to reach for something else to put in the category list
[2671.42s -> 2674.78s]  Uh, it was the flash in the corner and what am I gonna think?
[2675.58s -> 2677.33s]  That was auto
[2677.33s -> 2681.73s]  uh, and the winner for best auto moment of 2019 is going to go to
[2683.33s -> 2689.52s]  Who cares
[2689.52s -> 2693.60s]  Picross interruption auto picross 27 percent of the vote
[2696.00s -> 2701.98s]  What do you mean rude? Well, I I love this dog
[2703.82s -> 2709.74s]  But all those clips with the same clip and with all the besides there was all the same video
[2711.71s -> 2713.71s]  Otto, would you like it? Would you like to say something auto?
[2714.27s -> 2727.34s]  All right, zoom in on that and put it on the list for next year. We saw the tail wag. Yeah
[2728.46s -> 2735.12s]  All right coming up next is I don't think I do I need to introduce this one
[2735.68s -> 2743.62s]  Are you sure you want me to introduce?
[2744.32s -> 2745.60s]  it's uh
[2745.60s -> 2747.36s]  ladies and gentlemen the nominees
[2747.36s -> 2749.36s]  Uh for worst speeder of the year
[2758.42s -> 2767.84s]  Parker griffin and dinklage all famous faces sharing this common name. Dr. Schmoinson. Yes, I believe that is
[2770.03s -> 2772.03s]  Beater who is beater?
[2772.27s -> 2774.27s]  Who what is beater?
[2774.99s -> 2779.47s]  Why is he not talking? I I mean
[2780.83s -> 2786.11s]  I'm just trying to focus to get back to the 500 beaters in seven and a half minutes six and a half minutes
[2795.97s -> 2797.97s]  Still not big enough to get these
[2798.45s -> 2811.60s]  It's a goddamn maze beater
[2812.48s -> 2820.53s]  It's a maze beater
[2820.53s -> 2823.84s]  Okay, that was kind of funny. Not really
[2824.56s -> 2832.78s]  I think I got it. We're good. Hey, but we're in the end game here
[2837.65s -> 2839.89s]  How do you leave your voicemail on a public phone?
[2842.26s -> 2862.21s]  Later, uh, this year's worst feeder of the year
[2863.65s -> 2869.82s]  What do you think what do you think what was the worst? Uh, what was the worst budget?
[2870.38s -> 2872.38s]  I told you we're getting this shitty
[2872.62s -> 2874.62s]  Okay, auto was a fine category
[2875.22s -> 2877.46s]  Best question. So that auto was the only one that didn't make sense
[2878.10s -> 2885.94s]  What do you think?
[2885.94s -> 2891.02s]  Dr. Schmoinson beater for 32 percent of the vote by a lot actually
[2891.58s -> 2898.37s]  What was in second place? Let me see the schmoinson beater was apparently the worst one
[2898.45s -> 2902.13s]  But I don't know if I agree with that. I think I disagree with that one
[2902.69s -> 2904.69s]  The academy I think was got that one wrong
[2905.87s -> 2907.55s]  Uh, what came in second place?
[2907.55s -> 2909.55s]  Because that was 30 32 percent
[2910.27s -> 2915.25s]  Worst beater. Where is it?
[2915.25s -> 2917.49s]  Anyway, no, it was close. It was pretty close
[2920.19s -> 2922.11s]  So voicemail peter
[2922.11s -> 2923.63s]  Was the next one
[2923.63s -> 2925.95s]  Which was at 23 percent of the vote
[2926.94s -> 2927.82s]  so
[2927.82s -> 2930.69s]  Not a huge spread
[2930.69s -> 2935.41s]  By the way, this category will not return next year. I promise. I know I said that last year. I
[2936.54s -> 2942.38s]  I I promise this will not return next year. Please clip this and save it somewhere because don't let me do this again
[2943.62s -> 2944.82s]  in fact
[2944.82s -> 2953.94s]  Now that means I can't ever do it again this next category
[2956.00s -> 2959.50s]  Lying. Why is that a lie?
[2959.50s -> 2961.50s]  Not quite not yet. Not a lie yet
[2963.46s -> 2965.46s]  anyways moving on to uh
[2965.46s -> 2970.06s]  Hold on. Let me like burp internally this next category is
[2970.94s -> 2972.88s]  No, actually the next
[2972.88s -> 2976.32s]  Two categories in a row have to do with my physical appearance
[2977.55s -> 2980.85s]  Uh, we're coming up with next worst hair of 2019
[2981.55s -> 2984.21s]  worst hair
[2984.21s -> 2985.94s]  uh
[2985.94s -> 2987.94s]  I like having long hair
[2987.94s -> 2989.46s]  I like having
[2989.46s -> 2994.26s]  It shaped and be able to lay back behind my ears and have it. I I like having hair like this
[2994.74s -> 2996.74s]  Maybe not this long in particular, but
[2997.30s -> 2998.98s]  uh
[2998.98s -> 3003.06s]  Sometimes especially when it gets hot in here if i'm doing something or if things get a little
[3003.38s -> 3007.62s]  I've been streaming for six seven plus eight hours in a row and I don't get up and I go to the bathroom
[3007.62s -> 3011.30s]  I sit back down. Sometimes it gets a little messed up and there's not much you can do about that
[3013.02s -> 3016.38s]  And these are the times that people said was the worst it's ever looked on string
[3017.26s -> 3024.18s]  You I could throw water in my face into my hair, but then it gets all wet and stringy. I don't like it
[3024.26s -> 3029.88s]  So here you are. Here are your nominees for worst hair of 2019
[3031.62s -> 3033.62s]  Doesn't need that much more of an introduction
[3033.94s -> 3076.86s]  Why do you have braided hair? I'm leaving it. I ain't gonna fix it. Fuck that
[3077.42s -> 3079.86s]  It's a fucking drunk
[3080.02s -> 3082.42s]  God
[3082.42s -> 3084.42s]  It just it just happened. I don't know how
[3085.22s -> 3090.72s]  I have no idea
[3090.72s -> 3093.12s]  I don't I don't know why that happened. This is drunk as i've been on stream
[3093.84s -> 3095.76s]  This looks as I don't even care
[3095.92s -> 3100.64s]  You know, like you sometimes you give a shit about your appearance like when i'm when the when the webcam goes on, right?
[3100.88s -> 3106.56s]  And I know the webcams on usually i'm a little self-conscious, you know, I want to make sure that I look okay
[3107.92s -> 3110.48s]  How's my face looking? Do I look all right? Do I look okay?
[3111.20s -> 3113.20s]  I don't care right now and you can just tell
[3113.92s -> 3117.76s]  And this is like these images are gonna come back to haunt me in like fucking two years
[3119.04s -> 3120.32s]  Or one
[3120.32s -> 3122.32s]  Like I don't even care. Like I just don't
[3122.88s -> 3126.56s]  Typically i'd be like, oh hold on before I turn the camera on let me like okay
[3129.74s -> 3131.90s]  I know my hair is wicked fucked up because I was in the wind
[3133.14s -> 3138.34s]  I I know my hair looks like fucking al dente spaghetti today and that's because I was out in the wind
[3139.14s -> 3140.90s]  I was in the wind
[3140.90s -> 3142.90s]  sire
[3143.14s -> 3147.70s]  You have so many dropped frames and my family needs to use the internet and go to amazon
[3148.18s -> 3155.94s]  And buy cases of ocean can I nominate this for worse zip 2019 because that's and small small figurines of
[3156.32s -> 3160.10s]  Venom we need to and then he looks over
[3160.90s -> 3166.82s]  And he finally makes a decision right is filming off my camera
[3169.82s -> 3171.57s]  Hey, thanks

[3204.10s -> 3206.10s]  How are you doing? How's everything going? How are the kids?
[3207.65s -> 3211.73s]  Yeah, I don't know. I'm on the kind of screens of people under the bridge now, you know, that's what I do
[3212.37s -> 3214.69s]  It's been real. I just didn't get the job done
[3215.49s -> 3222.59s]  a lot of uh
[3222.59s -> 3230.80s]  A lot of good cat a lot of good nominees there a lot of good nominees, but they can only be one winner
[3231.74s -> 3238.86s]  Unfortunately, they can only be one and the winner for the worst hair in 2019 is going to go to
[3248.43s -> 3249.47s]  this
[3249.47s -> 3253.66s]  Won by a lot with 35 percent of the vote
[3254.46s -> 3260.67s]  Freud on red wine hair
[3262.02s -> 3267.52s]  With 35 percent of the vote guy under the bridge came in with about 27 percent
[3271.26s -> 3282.98s]  Worst hair of the year if I were to pick that one if it were going to be me
[3284.02s -> 3287.08s]  Uh, the vr trainwreck hair was disgusting
[3289.09s -> 3294.53s]  That's not only the worst hair i've ever had in 2019. That was and that didn't even I mean it was up there
[3295.78s -> 3297.78s]  The vr trainwreck hair came in third place
[3298.50s -> 3300.99s]  with 19 percent of the vote but
[3302.27s -> 3304.48s]  My god
[3304.48s -> 3308.48s]  It was un it was ridiculous. It looked like it was made it looked like it was dirty
[3309.12s -> 3314.16s]  It was dirty and greasy and looked like somebody put a bunch of hair gel in it and squished it together and held it
[3314.16s -> 3316.32s]  Tighten and fucking let it go after like an hour
[3316.88s -> 3321.22s]  Oh, it was horrible
[3321.22s -> 3322.98s]  We got another category to do
[3322.98s -> 3331.87s]  This is worst face
[3337.44s -> 3338.80s]  Worst face
[3338.80s -> 3343.52s]  Uh, we we do worst hair last year didn't do worst face last year. This is a new category this year
[3344.32s -> 3346.32s]  And it's a worst face
[3346.32s -> 3348.32s]  This is the worst face i've ever made on stream
[3348.64s -> 3355.52s]  In 2019 whether it's being shocked or trying to make do something funny that doesn't come across as funny. It's just ugly and strange
[3356.08s -> 3358.08s]  Uh, this is the cat these are the nominees
[3358.64s -> 3360.16s]  for worst face
[3360.16s -> 3378.90s]  of 2019
[3466.51s -> 3489.00s]  I hope you're proud of me. I hope you're proud mom the worst face of 2019
[3497.04s -> 3500.40s]  The big lipstick with 36 percent of the vote
[3501.58s -> 3506.93s]  It kind of destroyed
[3506.93s -> 3507.97s]  Yeah
[3507.97s -> 3510.34s]  It really wasn't close
[3510.34s -> 3514.94s]  after big lipstick
[3515.02s -> 3517.02s]  farting and screaming playlist
[3518.05s -> 3519.01s]  was
[3519.01s -> 3522.05s]  In second place at 13 percent and then the greedy grinner
[3522.69s -> 3527.09s]  at 13.08 percent which was farting scream was 13.2
[3527.65s -> 3530.29s]  Everything was very close recent bias. Maybe
[3531.34s -> 3533.04s]  maybe
[3533.04s -> 3537.60s]  But it is written down there very sloppily because you can tell the stream was late today, right?
[3537.60s -> 3542.48s]  We started we started the appointments like and there's a few reasons for that reasons are for what you're about to see
[3542.72s -> 3544.72s]  I had to get these written down and i'm just like
[3545.28s -> 3546.80s]  red lipstick
[3546.80s -> 3553.02s]  Because I got I got these
[3553.02s -> 3556.38s]  From I told you from amazon and i'm going do I just fucking do do I just like
[3556.78s -> 3559.90s]  Do I go to a store right now and get some more of these do I go to a store?
[3560.93s -> 3563.49s]  I freaked out and I was like, I just got whatever it doesn't matter
[3564.05s -> 3569.26s]  I was like about to get in the car and about to go. Uh, no, whatever. Okay
[3569.34s -> 3571.15s]  Just put them on the little ones
[3571.15s -> 3572.91s]  He's a professional streamer, by the way
[3572.91s -> 3577.31s]  No, I told you there were budget cuts this year that last year we were in a studio and I had all like that
[3577.31s -> 3579.07s]  A big allowed of trophies
[3579.07s -> 3589.63s]  We had to cut a few uh corners this year. What are you doing? What are you doing? What is this?
[3589.63s -> 3591.63s]  Why is we're spamming this? What is this?
[3591.71s -> 3593.71s]  This is spamming so fast. I can't even
[3597.82s -> 3602.46s]  All right. It's not january 1st, by the way
[3603.02s -> 3604.29s]  so
[3604.29s -> 3607.55s]  this uh
[3607.55s -> 3609.71s]  You can't uh, you can't nominate this
[3624.50s -> 3626.58s]  I'm such a fucking cartoon character
[3626.98s -> 3630.94s]  I
[3631.82s -> 3651.98s]  Can't even replicate that
[3651.98s -> 3653.74s]  That's apex twin
[3653.74s -> 3659.66s]  Do wait, did we say who it was? Yeah, it was a big lipstick. Of course it was moving along
[3660.54s -> 3662.54s]  Now we're moving into categories that
[3663.31s -> 3665.55s]  Potentially have a lot of nominees
[3666.51s -> 3670.03s]  Last year, this was an incredibly last second thing besides being in the studio
[3670.67s -> 3676.99s]  Uh, this was an insanely last second thing last year and really try to get as many good high quality
[3677.95s -> 3679.95s]  Categories as possible first, right?
[3680.59s -> 3685.81s]  This year and people only had like two or three days to nominate stuff and it was because it was bang bang bang
[3685.97s -> 3687.65s]  It was really quick last year
[3687.65s -> 3688.77s]  but
[3688.77s -> 3692.77s]  This year people had about a week and a half or so to figure out what they wanted to nominate and
[3694.11s -> 3699.55s]  There were a lot of nominees in some of these worse noise had like 25 nominees
[3700.11s -> 3702.83s]  We had to shave some off
[3702.83s -> 3708.19s]  It's a lot of nominees in some of these categories and we're going to show I think this one's doesn't not quite yet
[3709.30s -> 3711.94s]  But moving on to worst singing of the year, this is a new category
[3713.49s -> 3715.01s]  by the way
[3715.01s -> 3718.05s]  Both of these categories are the same category
[3720.00s -> 3724.64s]  The nominees in this category are no better than the nominees in this category
[3726.18s -> 3729.62s]  They I could switch these in my hands right now and you would not know the difference
[3731.17s -> 3733.54s]  so
[3733.54s -> 3734.98s]  We'll go ahead
[3734.98s -> 3737.14s]  And start with worst singing of the year
[3739.90s -> 3763.04s]  Let's see what the nominees are and this is the one that goes rolling around at the speed of sound
[3763.44s -> 3767.73s]  Right something like that
[3783.87s -> 3785.87s]  Sing him a song. Oh
[3786.43s -> 3789.12s]  Holy fuck that was horrible
[3791.26s -> 3793.26s]  Oh canada
[3794.62s -> 3797.42s]  Our home and sacred land

[3808.35s -> 3809.79s]  with
[3809.79s -> 3814.78s]  Street rat street rat. I am not a street rat
[3819.60s -> 3822.82s]  Gotta go to sleep gotta have some cheap gotta have some fun while I have time
[3824.71s -> 3826.71s]  Oh
[3847.51s -> 3850.25s]  I love the music in the background of the music
[3866.68s -> 3868.68s]  Worst singing of the year, apparently
[3868.68s -> 3869.64s]  Oh
[3869.64s -> 3872.44s]  This one wasn't even a fucking contest
[3873.08s -> 3875.48s]  Not even close not even close
[3877.84s -> 3880.80s]  This is ridiculous how unbelievable this was skewed
[3884.16s -> 3886.16s]  the winner of worst singing of
[3886.22s -> 3888.22s]  2019 with
[3888.98s -> 3891.38s]  50 percent of the vote and you have to remember
[3892.85s -> 3896.45s]  There were one two, three, four five six seven nominees in this category
[3897.09s -> 3901.06s]  The category the nominee after that had 13 percent
[3902.77s -> 3905.09s]  And it was eehee never gonna give you up
[3906.18s -> 3916.53s]  uh
[3916.53s -> 3917.97s]  Also, by the way
[3917.97s -> 3924.93s]  This is the first win of i got a feeling singing stream and second nomination of the night for worst stream of the year upcoming
[3926.64s -> 3929.22s]  That's on here a few times
[3929.22s -> 3931.14s]  That stream is on here
[3931.14s -> 3935.91s]  More than once also nominated for worst stream of the whole year
[3947.65s -> 3951.33s]  Okay, uh now it's best singing is now this is best singing
[3951.89s -> 3955.01s]  By the way, you'll see what i'm talking about when I say they both get the same damn category
[3955.17s -> 3958.21s]  I should have just had a singing category where like two people won
[3958.69s -> 3962.08s]  Here are the categories and the nominees
[3962.56s -> 3966.15s]  for best singing of the year
[4002.96s -> 4004.96s]  I will never stop it

[4009.75s -> 4011.75s]  You got a friend in me
[4013.60s -> 4015.60s]  You got a friend in me
[4017.80s -> 4019.80s]  with
[4034.66s -> 4036.66s]  I told you I told you
[4040.95s -> 4042.95s]  I'm so fucking angry right now
[4056.60s -> 4064.31s]  I can't even tell who's talking i'm gonna lose again. I was singing you can't you can't hear this is all fucking
[4066.23s -> 4068.23s]  Why is it like this
[4075.06s -> 4086.13s]  G
[4102.50s -> 4109.37s]  Of the 1,400 people that unfollowed tonight, um, I hope to see you soon. Hope to see you back
[4137.70s -> 4139.70s]  Only 17
[4143.57s -> 4150.95s]  You can dance you can laugh having the time of your life
[4162.53s -> 4169.44s]  All right, you know
[4169.44s -> 4171.12s]  Shit plays back to you
[4171.12s -> 4173.12s]  And you know, you've seen it you've heard it before
[4173.76s -> 4177.28s]  And you just you're looking at what you've done over the last year and you just kind of go
[4179.64s -> 4182.04s]  I now I understand what people think I do drugs on stream
[4182.76s -> 4186.34s]  You know what I mean? I got it. I get what you mean now when you say like, oh, hey
[4186.34s -> 4188.34s]  Is this dude like do fucking drugs?
[4191.00s -> 4193.00s]  It's kind of hard to defend
[4193.08s -> 4195.08s]  Against these nominees
[4195.08s -> 4196.36s]  anyways
[4196.36s -> 4200.20s]  The winner of best singing you already know what it is. Do I even need to do the fanfare?
[4200.20s -> 4204.84s]  Do I ever need to tell you do I it was if it was on the list it was gonna win, you know that
[4212.78s -> 4217.04s]  Qrs from the mind show stream at 30 percent of the vote
[4218.80s -> 4221.12s]  This was not as uh as far away as you thought it was
[4222.00s -> 4224.00s]  30 voted for qrs
[4226.23s -> 4228.23s]  Uh green day was after that
[4229.91s -> 4233.75s]  Somehow singing a katamari song was in third place with 16 percent of the vote
[4234.72s -> 4239.52s]  Which you couldn't it was me going like this. I know people are gonna fucking freak out
[4240.08s -> 4244.88s]  People are gonna be really upset with me and they're gonna tell me to stop but I need to show you what people are gonna say
[4244.96s -> 4249.52s]  Don't fucking do that. Don't stop doing that. But I need to you just need to hear it
[4252.55s -> 4258.20s]  That's what I was doing i'm not I do it I didn't do it for long I didn't do it for very long calm down
[4258.92s -> 4260.92s]  That's what I was doing. I was humming that to the beat
[4260.92s -> 4263.64s]  Apparently 16 percenting it thought that was the best thing i've done all year
[4264.44s -> 4266.60s]  I that's just what i'm not gonna go i'm not doing anymore
[4267.16s -> 4272.28s]  Those are new categories, by the way, this next category is
[4274.20s -> 4276.69s]  One of my favorites
[4276.69s -> 4278.69s]  best one guy moment of the year
[4279.78s -> 4282.98s]  Best one guy what is one guy moment for those of you that might be new to the channel
[4283.94s -> 4285.86s]  uh one guy
[4285.86s -> 4291.22s]  Is especially a one guy moment is when one person in the stream in the chat
[4292.85s -> 4297.41s]  Can either throw off the entire stream or can dictate the conversation exactly where it goes
[4298.05s -> 4300.13s]  I'll look over I will read something that somebody says
[4300.85s -> 4301.97s]  and
[4301.97s -> 4305.01s]  It will change the course of the entire history of the channel
[4306.56s -> 4308.04s]  so
[4308.04s -> 4310.04s]  If you stay on this stream
[4310.28s -> 4312.60s]  There's a possibility that you will one day be the one guy
[4313.16s -> 4317.80s]  That I would look over and say hey dude, like eat a ghost pepper on stream and i'll go. All right fucking cool, dude. Sure
[4319.20s -> 4321.28s]  I mean i'm not gonna do that, but I can at least pretend to right?
[4322.16s -> 4325.12s]  Uh best one here the nominees for best one guy moment of the year
[4326.24s -> 4331.12s]  A couple of these chicks shouldn't even fucking be on here, but I they made me laugh for a second. So they're on here

[4464.52s -> 4467.91s]  This is the image

[4673.84s -> 4675.12s]  besides just
[4675.12s -> 4677.12s]  Sweating in my shirt
[4678.82s -> 4681.54s]  For what i'm i'm kidding. I'm kidding
[4686.82s -> 4688.50s]  Uh the next category
[4688.50s -> 4692.71s]  I'm people saying the music's a little too loud. I'm sorry about that
[4693.19s -> 4695.19s]  Uh, the music is baked into every video
[4695.99s -> 4700.55s]  They were like 30 they were like 30 editors making these so like we try to get them as quick as we could
[4703.30s -> 4704.77s]  Can't fix
[4704.77s -> 4706.13s]  Sorry, you'll be all right
[4706.13s -> 4707.01s]  just
[4707.01s -> 4710.77s]  Fucking go like this
[4710.77s -> 4711.97s]  Okay
[4711.97s -> 4714.21s]  Uh worst vroom of the year if you don't know what a vroom is
[4716.08s -> 4718.26s]  a vroom
[4718.26s -> 4724.26s]  Is when I live in a place in by the way live in las vegas if you don't know, uh, I live in las vegas
[4725.06s -> 4726.26s]  and
[4726.26s -> 4730.50s]  I live in a spot where people like to either mod the fuck out of their cars
[4731.22s -> 4733.54s]  Or blow by the street that I live on
[4734.28s -> 4738.28s]  And it's really really irritating and it ruins streams. Sometimes it gets in the way
[4739.00s -> 4743.32s]  One actually happened about 30 or 40 minutes ago. So it happened already on this stream
[4744.79s -> 4746.08s]  it
[4746.08s -> 4748.32s]  I lose concentration. It's it's really fucking annoying
[4748.88s -> 4749.76s]  so
[4749.76s -> 4753.52s]  these are the worst times that they happened on stream this year and
[4754.16s -> 4756.48s]  I'm not even sure how accurate these nominees are
[4757.28s -> 4759.32s]  because
[4759.32s -> 4764.52s]  There's been so many of these that I think people forget just how fucking loud and obnoxious they are
[4765.68s -> 4768.76s]  There are some real good ones on here
[4768.84s -> 4784.77s]  Really good ones. What are you looking? He's like it's got the same hair too. He's got the same mustache hair
[4785.33s -> 4788.68s]  This could have been me
[4788.68s -> 4793.48s]  But if you know, you know, what's what's that joke like? Hey, i'm gonna tell my kids that like this was that that per
[4794.44s -> 4801.00s]  Just tell your kids that I was the mask because look look at this
[4802.71s -> 4804.47s]  It really could be that
[4804.47s -> 4813.88s]  That that's just me with makeup on
[4814.12s -> 4829.51s]  That is it's just me that's me with makeup on my nose is too pointy and big man that guy
[4829.99s -> 4831.89s]  All right, let's move on
[4831.89s -> 4836.05s]  This is worst room of the year coming up. I can't fucking
[4836.69s -> 4856.77s]  That's that's crazy. It's crazy to me. All right, uh worst room of the year here in the nominees. Well get there. Let's go g
[4858.79s -> 4863.27s]  Take me to the bary center. What the hell is going on here? Here we go
[4863.83s -> 4865.83s]  Does it say if there's life on it?
[4865.83s -> 4879.25s]  All right, there's life on this planet or life on this one
[4884.45s -> 4886.29s]  where's my little like the
[4886.37s -> 4888.37s]  Seismograph meter don't have one of those
[4889.25s -> 4904.29s]  Look up are those motorcycles in my room? I'm in vr. I can't tell
[4907.81s -> 4910.00s]  pistol
[4910.00s -> 4913.94s]  Shotgun shotgun. I don't like the shotgun
[4915.94s -> 4920.98s]  Pretty good timing pretty good time
[4920.98s -> 4923.30s]  It was a one minute and 12 seconds first lap
[4924.02s -> 4926.02s]  See you again in a minute and 15 seconds
[4928.20s -> 4929.72s]  I'm gonna give the shotgun
[4929.72s -> 4934.90s]  When I get the money
[4934.90s -> 4938.34s]  All right, I just I felt like somebody was just going to just drive into the house
[4939.22s -> 4943.22s]  Like I really felt like somebody was going into the window like I thought that was somebody in a little drone
[4943.78s -> 4946.66s]  Flying and crashing into my window. That just scared the shit out of me
[4949.36s -> 4953.08s]  That was in the house. Yeah
[4953.08s -> 4959.24s]  That sounded fake if somebody's in a pod racer out here. That was a star wars fucking pod racer
[4960.32s -> 4962.56s]  That wasn't even a car
[4962.56s -> 4965.68s]  You you give her a little thing like oh say goodbye. You don't just like
[4966.40s -> 4975.81s]  flush
[4976.21s -> 4978.21s]  Whoa
[4978.69s -> 4990.85s]  Keep her in a box. You really can't do that. Gabby will start to smell up the drawer
[4991.09s -> 4994.85s]  I'm glad I cannot fall down this unless I really fuck this part up right here
[4999.36s -> 5007.76s]  All right that fucking guy driving the car the guy in the fucking car that just sped by at a thousand miles per hour
[5008.56s -> 5010.56s]  It's just screened in my ear
[5015.96s -> 5017.96s]  What the fuck man?
[5020.21s -> 5022.05s]  That's so annoying
[5022.05s -> 5024.69s]  That's so annoying
[5024.69s -> 5026.69s]  Whatever. That's two that's I
[5027.33s -> 5029.73s]  Give me a break though. Seriously. I get to be mad at that
[5032.61s -> 5037.65s]  I get to be upset about that. That's so annoying and somebody's screaming outside your window as loud as they can
[5038.76s -> 5042.20s]  Like somebody just threw a glass bottle at my house while I took that jump
[5043.08s -> 5056.10s]  I'll get back up there. All right, you can hear that one was real
[5057.35s -> 5059.83s]  Yeah, I know you hear the fake one right now, but that one was real
[5060.47s -> 5068.90s]  that was not a
[5077.04s -> 5080.85s]  Uh, yeah, it happens all the time. It's such a pain in the ass
[5083.62s -> 5084.98s]  and
[5084.98s -> 5089.06s]  It really it really is starting to become a pretty major problem. It really is
[5089.86s -> 5094.92s]  What would you guys say? Um, I would say
[5096.36s -> 5101.56s]  Probably two or three times a stream, right? It has to be it has to be at least two or three times a stream
[5104.19s -> 5107.12s]  soundproof your house
[5107.12s -> 5109.08s]  Okay
[5109.08s -> 5111.16s]  Worst room of the year. This was very close
[5112.12s -> 5114.53s]  There is the closest one all night by the way
[5123.35s -> 5124.85s]  at
[5124.85s -> 5126.85s]  24.9 percent of the vote
[5131.09s -> 5134.77s]  right on time
[5134.77s -> 5141.27s]  Distraction jump king pod racer. No, that's not correct. I blew it. Uh distraction jump king
[5142.23s -> 5144.23s]  Pod racer was right below it
[5145.54s -> 5150.18s]  Distraction jump king was at 24 percent pod racer was at 22.5 percent
[5152.60s -> 5159.86s]  There you go. That was very very close closest one all night. It was lala land
[5164.76s -> 5166.76s]  I'm, not looking forward to these categories coming up
[5167.40s -> 5173.24s]  Because these when now we're getting into embarrassing territory like we haven't already apparently we haven't already
[5174.60s -> 5179.80s]  I like to do impressions off the cuff. Sometimes they're good. Sometimes they're bad
[5180.52s -> 5182.52s]  Uh, most of the times they're bad
[5182.76s -> 5186.28s]  The hair was pretty embarrassing. You're right. Uh, most of the time they're very bad
[5187.08s -> 5188.79s]  um
[5188.79s -> 5191.99s]  This is another one of those categories where there's two of them for some reason
[5193.49s -> 5195.49s]  worst impression and best impression
[5198.34s -> 5204.42s]  Another interchangeable list and some of these nominees don't did you no you didn't okay. Yeah, you i'm good
[5205.30s -> 5209.54s]  Uh, a lot of these nominees just kind of people nominated I think just to just to be funny
[5210.66s -> 5214.66s]  One of one of these nominees in particular and we went through and we were like, all right. This was this was nominated
[5215.46s -> 5217.70s]  This was nominated like six times
[5218.02s -> 5223.30s]  So we yeah, we have to put it in we can't just like leave it out, but it's not it's it's barely anything
[5223.94s -> 5229.54s]  You'll see the nominees for worst impression of the year whether of a video game character a celebrity
[5230.18s -> 5234.53s]  or a
[5234.53s -> 5240.26s]  That's not there's no other impressions. There you go. Worst impression of the year the nominees are
[5254.47s -> 5256.47s]  Hey

[5270.42s -> 5275.54s]  How can you get mad at homer simpson seeing all these toys makes me wish I was a kid again
[5275.94s -> 5280.66s]  If it's any consolation, I still think of you as a child. Thanks. I wish the court
[5290.45s -> 5297.14s]  Shot I do that. I love how they have the combine voice that like
[5299.14s -> 5302.26s]  Like that was just delete that whole clip it was not even worth watching
[5303.46s -> 5308.07s]  Dude, what's the best peter griffin impression? You got it. Hey, uh, no
[5309.44s -> 5314.76s]  Why don't wait did I just do I have to walk behind the counter and make the change goofy?
[5314.76s -> 5318.53s]  What the hell do you do here?
[5324.12s -> 5329.88s]  Well, I don't know anything about mad donald that's okay goofy i'll take care of you
[5332.87s -> 5335.75s]  Hey, okay. It's your thing. I did all the time
[5337.81s -> 5341.27s]  Oh, you're all about sex aren't you quagmire?
[5342.23s -> 5353.05s]  Yeah
[5354.41s -> 5363.59s]  All right, let's go gonna jump oh I can't wait to fight
[5371.11s -> 5373.11s]  No, I can't it's too early
[5373.75s -> 5384.10s]  I don't know how it's possible that this this one last year
[5384.74s -> 5387.54s]  This one whatever who cares this one leg
[5391.00s -> 5393.56s]  It's donald duck donald fucking duck
[5394.52s -> 5401.96s]  17.8 percent of the vote donald duck won last year for worst impression. I just thought just I should just not do donald duck anymore
[5402.92s -> 5406.14s]  I'll just i'm never gonna I will never do donald duck ever again
[5406.86s -> 5408.62s]  I'll never try
[5408.62s -> 5412.55s]  Take a quick wine break
[5412.55s -> 5415.85s]  Try try it now try it now. All right
[5422.73s -> 5439.54s]  Fucking it's it's 2019 still fuck you donald duck was 17.8 percent by the way
[5441.05s -> 5443.05s]  This was very close
[5443.05s -> 5446.65s]  Canadian homer simpson was at 16.7 percent of the vote
[5450.24s -> 5456.82s]  17.8 for donald and 16.7 for homer simpson. It was all awful. There's two peter griffins
[5459.62s -> 5464.98s]  Just like the bad ones. There are also some good ones. I do have at least
[5467.14s -> 5470.74s]  Like half a tank of talent. Okay, i'm not gonna say i got a full tank of talent
[5471.38s -> 5474.01s]  I got a half a tank of talent
[5474.01s -> 5477.48s]  Look, you gotta know what you have
[5477.48s -> 5479.48s]  Best impression of the year coming up
[5480.50s -> 5483.83s]  Here are the nominees get off the screen
[5484.47s -> 5502.52s]  I see some of you guys in this chat with your moms going
[5506.66s -> 5512.10s]  You bit your controller because you lost one of these missions like 15 times in a row. I know it jerma
[5512.10s -> 5514.42s]  How is it possible that you could be this bad?
[5526.60s -> 5528.60s]  It's it's joe rivers
[5529.32s -> 5530.82s]  Oh children
[5530.82s -> 5535.00s]  Absolutely, it's unbelievable. Oh darling. You look so beautiful right now on the runway
[5535.32s -> 5538.28s]  Let me tell you something about just how I forgot about the fuck
[5539.00s -> 5544.04s]  I forgot fucking let's go. I can't fix it. I think I have this voice forever. I have this voice forever
[5544.12s -> 5548.68s]  I did I fucked it up. I coughed too much and now it's over. I actually have this voice forever
[5549.72s -> 5551.72s]  This is it. My career is over
[5554.97s -> 5558.89s]  you know, that's that's why this game is so difficult actually now that I think about it because
[5559.77s -> 5567.13s]  If you it's like triangle triangle triangle triangle l right that's easy triangle triangle triangle l but the way that he talks
[5567.85s -> 5572.65s]  No, I know what we stop the target. It's just uh, it's not doesn't add up for my brain
[5574.17s -> 5577.29s]  Jerma, can you pretend to be elmo thanos for the rest of the stream?
[5594.74s -> 5596.74s]  Reality is already
[5597.54s -> 5606.06s]  Mr. Noodle reality is often disappointing. Mr. Noodle. That's all you get
[5607.90s -> 5611.42s]  All right, what if we can do a bit of gallop impression, uh wins the contest. Okay, uh go
[5615.66s -> 5618.47s]  Go your turn go go go
[5625.98s -> 5629.42s]  It's gonna be a post post human post human poggles i'm telling you post human
[5631.94s -> 5637.86s]  What's gonna happen is the seaman are gonna come up here and they're that's where
[5639.38s -> 5644.58s]  Seaman are gonna come up and they are gonna totally just absolutely wipe us out and they're the globalists
[5644.58s -> 5649.14s]  We're gonna take over with the seaman and then it goes real high. It goes real high joe
[5650.70s -> 5652.70s]  sorting algorithm noise
[5655.86s -> 5657.86s]  Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about
[5659.51s -> 5662.79s]  The things they yeah. Oh you're killing me. Yep
[5674.06s -> 5678.62s]  Oh, I have to listen to it now then it goes like
[5683.59s -> 5687.24s]  Oh, I have to hear it right now, let's go
[5691.06s -> 5693.06s]  For 15 pm
[5694.81s -> 5702.95s]  Don't you think your mother has had enough aggravation carrying you in her belly for nine long months
[5705.21s -> 5708.03s]  Stop being a freeloader and step out into the real world
[5721.86s -> 5724.66s]  Do it man, come on, okay, let's go
[5725.62s -> 5735.85s]  I I cut that one off accidentally
[5736.57s -> 5741.48s]  Like I said, I have to take it out
[5744.12s -> 5767.66s]  The winner is best impression of the year. Why I don't what do you think thanos elmo?
[5768.38s -> 5774.94s]  With 22.5 percent of the vote elmo was there last year too. How many times have I done elmo on this stream?
[5780.07s -> 5785.19s]  Elmo here's what I don't understand. Okay, let me give you I want to break down some data for you
[5786.57s -> 5787.77s]  so
[5787.77s -> 5790.14s]  apparently
[5790.14s -> 5796.46s]  One of the worst things I did as an impression for last year was torture me elmo that got
[5797.19s -> 5801.45s]  Like 15 percent of the vote, but also thanos elmo
[5803.35s -> 5805.53s]  won best impression
[5805.53s -> 5808.89s]  How could I be on two different categories? I don't understand
[5809.85s -> 5813.35s]  Uh sorting algorithm was in second place followed by ed ed and eddie
[5814.15s -> 5816.15s]  Uh both at about 12 percent
[5816.47s -> 5821.34s]  respectively thanos elmo
[5822.86s -> 5825.90s]  All right. Now we're getting into the real the real stuff here
[5826.54s -> 5829.18s]  Still plenty of categories to go still a lot of categories to go
[5831.58s -> 5835.72s]  Coming up next is
[5835.72s -> 5840.65s]  We make a lot of jokes on this stream. First of all, some of them are better than others
[5841.21s -> 5843.48s]  Some of them take a lot of time
[5843.48s -> 5845.88s]  And they either land or they don't
[5847.66s -> 5849.66s]  These are the nominees
[5849.91s -> 5854.55s]  For the worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up
[5865.59s -> 5868.34s]  You good? Are you good ato?
[5869.21s -> 5871.18s]  Yeah, he's good
[5871.18s -> 5874.70s]  Uh, yeah, so this is the worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up
[5875.18s -> 5877.66s]  whether that's finding clips and images or
[5878.54s -> 5883.66s]  Getting sounds ready and then all right. It's been like 15 straight minutes. Let's try to make something funny happen and
[5884.38s -> 5885.82s]  Didn't work out so well
[5885.82s -> 5890.09s]  Here are the nominees for worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up
[5920.50s -> 5926.10s]  I'm here with my friends. I've got my friends here. We're all doctors here. This guy's taking up my fucking limelight
[5931.82s -> 5934.25s]  All right the nominees
[5934.73s -> 5935.53s]  for
[5935.53s -> 5936.49s]  best
[5936.49s -> 5939.21s]  Joke taking more than five minutes to set up
[5940.81s -> 5942.41s]  Does that be real?
[5942.41s -> 5946.57s]  But so how do I prepare for how do I do I prepare for this everyone be laughing your ass off, right?
[5946.57s -> 5949.29s]  Like I I want like I want only luls in the chat
[5949.93s -> 5952.33s]  The cat is seriously up up in the tree
[5953.21s -> 5959.93s]  I'm trying to find a way I put on swimmies right to try to climb the tree better to think maybe there's gonna be grip
[5961.69s -> 5963.13s]  I know it's crazy
[5963.13s -> 5965.05s]  Wait, did we get a raid?
[5965.05s -> 5970.49s]  Hold on. I'm in the middle telling this crazy crazy story that happened to me when I was like fucking 19
[5972.49s -> 5974.49s]  Hey, hey edna
[5974.65s -> 5976.65s]  Okay, does the tv work yet?
[5977.61s -> 5980.01s]  Maybe just adjust it a little to the left
[5980.89s -> 5982.25s]  Say hello
[5982.25s -> 5984.25s]  Teleport to the tractor sleep for a week
[5984.89s -> 5990.73s]  Teleport to the truck say hello teleport to the tractor sleep for a week until it's all until I marry this person
[5992.09s -> 5997.13s]  This is bullshit and i'll tell you why I don't think anybody's played this game. We're seeing this
[5997.93s -> 6004.89s]  There's no way since one game hour is about five minutes. That means 12 hours in game. You can talk to the ladies. Wait, what?
[6005.61s -> 6008.73s]  You can only complement them once per real hour
[6010.25s -> 6022.54s]  Of the youngest one
[6031.99s -> 6036.95s]  There's so much science as to what the heck is this even is it energy is it a time paradox
[6037.83s -> 6042.31s]  Is it aliens? Did aliens make this? I don't know. It's so many questions that I have
[6042.95s -> 6074.81s]  We'll never know the answers to so before I real the real before I reveal the winner of this category
[6075.61s -> 6077.61s]  I have to make something very very clear
[6078.54s -> 6084.30s]  Sometimes you spend some money and time and resources and you you think something's a really great idea
[6085.90s -> 6086.70s]  and
[6086.70s -> 6088.94s]  Fucking rumor get the fuck out of here
[6089.99s -> 6094.55s]  Uh, sometimes you have some ideas that don't play out so well, even when even if you hope they do
[6097.19s -> 6100.72s]  and with
[6100.72s -> 6102.72s]  39 percent of the vote
[6103.14s -> 6105.77s]  by a majority
[6105.77s -> 6109.05s]  And this fucking kind of annoys me in a way and i'll tell you why
[6117.52s -> 6120.26s]  Bugleberry making pottery with almost 40 percent of the vote
[6124.47s -> 6129.67s]  Now here's where this is bad and this is why this sucks the most for me
[6131.29s -> 6133.45s]  because
[6133.45s -> 6137.37s]  I had to take pottery classes to learn how to do that
[6140.09s -> 6142.09s]  You notice how I knew what the fuck I was doing
[6142.49s -> 6147.64s]  I went to pottery class
[6147.64s -> 6149.64s]  To like know how to do that
[6151.75s -> 6153.83s]  And it turns out it was the worst thing I did all year
[6154.55s -> 6164.50s]  It's okay. Hey look like I said as if you play baseball if you're a baseball player and you strike out seven times
[6165.30s -> 6169.38s]  As long as you hit three home runs, you're one of the best players in baseball
[6174.58s -> 6184.86s]  That's a 300 average that took five days to set up took more than that. That was more than five minutes. That was uh,
[6185.50s -> 6187.50s]  like three weeks
[6188.84s -> 6194.76s]  Of learning how to do pottery and then setting up all the but that I love that stream. That's like I love that stream
[6194.76s -> 6196.60s]  That's that's by the way
[6196.60s -> 6198.68s]  That stream is nominated for best stream of the year. So
[6199.48s -> 6201.56s]  Look, you can have a bad part of one good stream
[6203.48s -> 6209.32s]  And I know everybody fucking hates bugleberry bugleberry won worst character last year. He ain't going anywhere
[6209.88s -> 6212.14s]  He ain't going anywhere. He's gonna be the next big event
[6213.21s -> 6218.41s]  He ain't ever fucking going anywhere. I mean he's gonna be at every single event and I will those of you that it might be
[6218.49s -> 6220.58s]  New to the channel
[6220.58s -> 6224.58s]  When I did that segment with bugleberry, I think we had 8 000 concurrent viewers, right?
[6225.70s -> 6228.10s]  The second that bugleberry came on stream
[6228.90s -> 6230.90s]  We dropped I believe
[6231.92s -> 6233.62s]  3000 viewers
[6233.62s -> 6238.58s]  We went from 8 000 concurrent down to like 5000 concurrent instantly
[6239.30s -> 6243.66s]  I don't even give a shit. He's coming back
[6246.81s -> 6250.89s]  Just like there are bad jokes that take more than five minutes to set up. There are also good ones apparently
[6251.61s -> 6253.61s]  Here is the nominee category
[6254.62s -> 6257.58s]  For best joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up
[6260.04s -> 6268.84s]  We'll see
[6268.84s -> 6270.84s]  Oh, it's beautiful jack
[6271.82s -> 6280.52s]  It sure is
[6281.16s -> 6283.16s]  Oh, it's beautiful. I know
[6287.05s -> 6291.06s]  Oh
[6293.08s -> 6295.08s]  Oh my fucking god
[6296.82s -> 6301.94s]  I've got it. You're that pit boss from the toy is he wearing lipstick. I smell a conspiracy
[6302.50s -> 6307.38s]  You smell a nosy dog who's going to get smacked if he don't stop asking questions
[6308.26s -> 6318.63s]  Fucking set on the package that wasn't gonna come off
[6321.66s -> 6327.42s]  Bro, I can't this is an acting. Okay, this is this is an acting class
[6327.98s -> 6331.10s]  You want to learn how to act and you want to learn how to compose yourself during a scene?
[6331.18s -> 6333.82s]  They should do this in workshops. I should run a workshop and do this
[6349.26s -> 6366.87s]  And again, but sometimes the right one for you
[6368.71s -> 6373.96s]  It's not working
[6374.04s -> 6378.68s]  It's not working. I just like ate like I just ate like a person
[6379.48s -> 6381.48s]  I wouldn't I eat right here?
[6381.80s -> 6383.80s]  Get off. What do you guys want to do?
[6384.76s -> 6388.92s]  I can I can barely do anything. I I really don't want to lie to you guys
[6389.72s -> 6394.36s]  But I seriously fucking can't do shit right now story three was really good somebody asked in the chat
[6394.44s -> 6396.44s]  Let's make sure that I got I answered it
[6402.23s -> 6405.59s]  Story four was okay, too. I didn't I didn't I I liked it
[6428.17s -> 6434.81s]  Okay, i'm not i'm not even kidding on january 23rd i'm gonna like final destination movie my house
[6435.37s -> 6436.65s]  I'm serious
[6436.65s -> 6438.65s]  I just fucked myself three minutes
[6439.93s -> 6444.86s]  Right here i'm gonna lie just lie down
[6445.10s -> 6454.25s]  I was relaxing
[6455.42s -> 6457.34s]  Here's the thing kids
[6457.34s -> 6462.74s]  When you buy used games make sure very very important kids
[6463.78s -> 6468.74s]  Always under every circumstance make sure that you get exactly what you paid for in that box
[6469.38s -> 6472.82s]  Because if it doesn't come in there you end up in a scenario like this
[6472.82s -> 6474.82s]  Yes
[6475.46s -> 6477.46s]  And he doesn't have the other yes
[6502.01s -> 6523.30s]  I hope that one wins. That was that what a great game. It's close. It was close
[6534.44s -> 6536.76s]  Farting and screaming playlist at the gym
[6540.06s -> 6543.10s]  With 29.4 percent of the vote
[6543.96s -> 6546.76s]  Uh very closely followed by germa dies
[6547.88s -> 6549.88s]  At 20.9 percent
[6552.57s -> 6554.23s]  There you go
[6554.23s -> 6561.98s]  Best joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up titanic was robbed. I'll get you know, that's a big category
[6562.06s -> 6563.51s]  So i'll give you
[6563.51s -> 6565.69s]  Uh worst joke by the way
[6565.69s -> 6567.59s]  bugleberry destroyed
[6567.59s -> 6571.75s]  But after that at fifth, oh god people fucking hated that
[6572.79s -> 6575.03s]  People hated that shit so much
[6576.96s -> 6582.34s]  40 for bugleberry for worst and then trying to get married in farmer's dynasty was number two

[7656.79s -> 7659.54s]  God damn it
[7660.02s -> 7665.59s]  That's just that's the fucking worst thing that ever happened to me in a game
[7666.23s -> 7671.43s]  Without a doubt. That's the scariest because I know I have zero health and there's like 30 minutes of
[7672.39s -> 7678.95s]  That was really really really real that was real that's because that's what would happen if a monster tried to kill me in real life
[7679.51s -> 7683.35s]  I can't believe it. I can't believe it

[7895.89s -> 7900.21s]  It crushed it that I I thought I was gonna die. I really thought I was gonna die
[7900.93s -> 7906.58s]  Because when you're in vr, you have no perception of anything around you
[7909.54s -> 7917.25s]  And when you feel physical violence on you, you're just like i'm dead. I'm fucking dead in real life

[8025.94s -> 8032.26s]  If I died by that little monster, I would have had to come back and play 40 minutes of the game again
[8033.20s -> 8034.80s]  Oh would have been horrible
[8034.80s -> 8050.28s]  People are spamming a link. I don't even look like this

[9600.79s -> 9603.86s]  In probably five years
[9603.86s -> 9611.65s]  Simpsons hit and run was the worst meltdown by far if you want to know the uh runners up sure we can do that
[9614.50s -> 9616.82s]  The next one was jump king

[17022.24s -> 17024.56s]  I'm usually serious and stone-faced around people
[17025.31s -> 17027.31s]  But after I met you in early 2017

[17057.92s -> 17060.08s]  I single-handedly raised the bit minimum twice
[17060.88s -> 17061.68s]  Yes
[17061.68s -> 17065.12s]  It used to be 25 bits before garf stepped in the picture
[17065.20s -> 17067.92s]  I bet some of you new subs don't even know about that one
[17068.62s -> 17072.62s]  I don't know if i'm allowed to do this but since this is the last gar for graph of the decade
[17073.41s -> 17075.49s]  I guess it was worth a chart a shot
[17080.72s -> 17085.84s]  Garfield the monday killer is the reason why we have raised the minimum bits and here here you go here
[17087.71s -> 17090.91s]  It used to be a hundred actually and then garfield the monday killer
[17091.81s -> 17095.01s]  uh came along and
[17095.01s -> 17102.26s]  Gave a hundred and a lot and we had to increase the bits because it was uh, it was got one too long
[17104.08s -> 17110.22s]  But the monday killer strikes twice
[17110.54s -> 17118.06s]  Where's my keys 300 bits? Can I donate directly through twitch? I don't know. I don't have that available only through twitch or subs, unfortunately
