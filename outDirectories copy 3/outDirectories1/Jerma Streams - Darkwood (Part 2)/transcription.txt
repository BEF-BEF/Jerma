[1.53s -> 11.17s]  This is gonna sound weird. Do you ever sit down in your chair, or in your car, and you know nothing has been changed?
[11.17s -> 19.66s]  You know that you haven't moved the seat, you know that you haven't changed where the wheel is, or where your mouse is, or where your armrests are.
[19.66s -> 28.16s]  But it doesn't feel correct. It feels like somebody changed everything about this seat, and this has been the same way for probably eight and a half months.
[28.16s -> 38.12s]  It's freaking me out. Well, it feels like the armrests are too high. I didn't do anything. It's weird.
[38.12s -> 45.07s]  Maybe I should go up a little? I'm gonna go up. Let's see if this helps.
[45.07s -> 51.76s]  And now when you adjust to try to get it the way that you want it, the way that you remember it, you'll never get it the same way again.
[51.76s -> 61.71s]  It's getting shorter. No, I'm saying, like, I need to be up higher. Doesn't matter how long your legs are.
[61.71s -> 69.71s]  Guys, everybody that goes and gets their hair cut, they pump, pump, pump, pump, they pump you up in that chair. You could be six-five.
[71.40s -> 84.26s]  Don't matter. Anyways, welcome, everybody. Welcome back. Time to get scared.
[84.26s -> 92.82s]  It is going to be a continuation of Darkwood for as long as I can tolerate it, I guess.
[92.82s -> 106.53s]  Should be fun. I'm enjoying it so far. That might change over the next five to seven hours. I don't know.
[106.53s -> 111.96s]  He's just tolerating it. He's tolerating. Tolerating implies you don't like doing it.
[111.96s -> 122.38s]  Well, I'm talking about scariness and stress. It's not that I'm tolerating the game.
[122.38s -> 130.46s]  I'm tolerating what happens when you play a game like this. You get stressed. You get jumpy.
[130.46s -> 143.31s]  It's not too scary. So tolerating the game. No, the game is good. It's just, all right, if somebody screams in your face,
[143.31s -> 149.62s]  there's only so many times somebody can scream in your face before you're like, all right, I can't do that anymore.
[149.62s -> 157.54s]  That person could be an amazing juggler, and they're doing an incredible juggling, and it's the best juggling act you've ever seen.
[157.54s -> 162.54s]  But every four or five minutes, they just lean over and they scream directly in your face.
[162.54s -> 168.68s]  You're going to be like, this is great juggling act, but he screams a lot, doesn't he?
[168.68s -> 180.47s]  Anyways, hopefully this, I have to turn my webcam on. How do I turn off the whole stream?
[180.47s -> 186.78s]  Because I think I was not, I didn't have any clothes on when I was doing this last.
[186.78s -> 193.78s]  So, and sometimes this webcam takes a frame of the last thing that I did before I turn off the cam on OBS.
[193.78s -> 200.78s]  So there's, I have no shirt on for this, and I'm certain of it. So I need to like turn it on without you seeing.
[200.78s -> 207.78s]  How do I, I think I can do it like this. I think, I hope this works. Please work.
[207.78s -> 215.90s]  Don't like come up and hold on, I need to see where this is. All right, I almost just did it. Thank God I moved it.
[215.90s -> 225.58s]  Okay, so now this should be fine because I've just turned it on and turned it off like twice.
[225.58s -> 235.84s]  Don't be fucking naked. Don't be naked. Don't be naked. Don't be naked. Don't be naked.
[235.84s -> 252.44s]  Yes, we're good. We're good. I look a little tired today. It's because I had a bad dream last night.
[252.44s -> 258.19s]  And anytime you have a bad dream, it's like you hadn't slept at all.
[258.19s -> 267.10s]  All right. Let's see, make sure that's all set. It's a story time. No, this is not a story time dream.
[267.10s -> 279.44s]  This is just scary and horrible. It's like somebody broke into the house and I was like, like hiding around a corner.
[279.44s -> 284.44s]  And they were like going through everything and breaking stuff and trying to attack everybody.
[284.44s -> 290.44s]  And I'm just like, what the fuck do I do? What the fuck do I do? And I grabbed, this is gonna sound crazy.
[290.44s -> 297.94s]  I don't know why this was here, but I grabbed a music stand, a music stand.
[297.94s -> 305.94s]  But the thing that you put the, you know, like the notes on, I don't know why that was in my house.
[305.94s -> 311.94s]  And I had this music stand. I was like, I'm gonna fucking bash this guy's head in. And then I woke up.
[311.94s -> 323.20s]  I mean, it was just terrifying because I'm playing this. Guys, this is why I don't play. I'm playing a scary game.
[323.20s -> 332.01s]  That's why I had this dream. Okay. It makes sense. But that was the only thing that was around.
[332.01s -> 337.63s]  It was, that was it. I had to use it. It's the game. All right. Let's go.
[337.63s -> 343.63s]  If you don't know, this is obviously Starkwood. Played about six hours of it last night.
[343.63s -> 353.35s]  You got to be careful when coffee is filled to the brim. And I did it this time. It was me.
[353.35s -> 362.61s]  I talked a lot of shit about this and I did it. But here's the difference though. It's open.
[362.61s -> 375.60s]  It's different when you do it to yourself. You know what I mean? When somebody else does it, you can slide it.
[375.60s -> 382.17s]  All right. Let's go. Is the webcam too big? I don't know. I spilled on my shirt. No, I didn't.
[382.17s -> 387.86s]  We're on day 11. All right. I got to get ready. I can stall as long as I want.
[387.86s -> 404.42s]  I don't know why I'm doing this. It's because I know it's about to happen. I have to like concentrate and it's like, it's hard.
[404.42s -> 417.90s]  Somebody just said to go to the spa. All right. I'm ready. Nice hair.
[417.90s -> 425.58s]  I know. Everyone talks about my hair. One day I'll have the best hair on Twitch and then nobody will be able to make fun of me ever again.
[425.58s -> 432.82s]  All right. Let's go. This is a 758 chapter one day 11 difficulty. Pretty hard.
[432.82s -> 440.74s]  Why did I? I just saw the only thing that was a color and I just almost clicked it. All right. Both headphones going in. I'm going in.
[440.74s -> 447.82s]  You're playing a challenging and unforgiving game. You will not be led by the hand. Respect the woods. Be patient and focus.
[447.82s -> 461.63s]  Yeah, I'm going in. This is two headphones. Horror movies have two headphones. It's called normal.
[461.63s -> 467.13s]  No, but it's not, though, because the game told me that it was very hard to begin with.
[467.13s -> 475.33s]  So it's already already on hard. The other two difficulties are just harder and hardest. Hard, harder, hardest.
[475.33s -> 494.22s]  All right. That's good. So we got to the second shelter. Lost. Oh, I died in here. Right. That's the last thing that happened.
[494.22s -> 499.22s]  Somebody told me to put the bathtub up in the corner. It turned out to be incredibly incorrect.
[499.22s -> 510.66s]  Where's my backpack? There it is. All right. So now I've got time. What I was going to do today.
[510.66s -> 518.66s]  Those of you have no idea what this game is. This is Darkwood. It's a game about surviving in a haunted, scary forest.
[518.66s -> 526.35s]  And you have to go to different hideouts. And I'm at hideout two. And it's scary and it's hard. It's a very hard game.
[526.35s -> 531.91s]  So you're going to see me probably lose a few times, but it's because it's hard, not because I'm bad at the game.
[531.91s -> 550.67s]  You know, when you even go to a toy store and there's those things that, you know, I have to I have to annoy everybody as soon as possible.
[550.67s -> 562.42s]  That's what I have to do on this stream. All right. So the time is frozen right now so I can. Where's the. That's good.
[562.42s -> 570.54s]  He's just doing the same stream. No, it's callback. All right. I got a lockpick. I have to rearrange this.
[570.54s -> 573.54s]  I hate this already. What did I do? Gas on the bottom.
[573.54s -> 581.38s]  Graph from the bottom. Oh, this is so annoying.
[581.38s -> 589.37s]  What a mess. And there was wood was up here.
[589.37s -> 594.37s]  Torch is technically made out of wood, but it's going to go my inventory. Shiny stone is technically a metal.
[594.37s -> 598.37s]  Technically. Well, it's kind of a metal. Wood is going to go here.
[598.37s -> 605.69s]  Wooden rocks will go here.
[609.49s -> 616.80s]  There it is. All right. Wood. Wood. Consumables. Recycling will go this way.
[616.80s -> 625.18s]  Yeah, this is like recycling and just shit that is like miscellaneous.
[625.18s -> 635.27s]  Drugs and alcohol go up on top of here and only have three stacks.
[635.27s -> 639.27s]  He's still streaming this. Yeah, I haven't stopped since yesterday. That's why I look a little tired.
[639.27s -> 647.80s]  I'm just so into it. I'm like looking addicted to it. It's just real fun. I haven't stopped.
[647.80s -> 652.80s]  And I didn't put that emote. The German sour emote wasn't there at stream start yesterday.
[652.80s -> 657.80s]  So here you are. I've only got like another six hours of this shit before. It's over 24 hours.
[657.80s -> 667.06s]  All right. Weapons are going to go up top. This is technically wood.
[667.06s -> 677.17s]  I don't know why that wasn't just part of the stack in the first place. All right. So drugs, alcohol, fire, drugs.
[677.17s -> 682.79s]  OK, now keep that together. Shovel is going to go.
[682.79s -> 687.46s]  OK, fan belt is just miscellaneous, but I don't know.
[687.46s -> 693.26s]  Guns, weapons are going to go up top because that's obviously important, right?
[693.26s -> 698.72s]  Still, I need to be able to make that. The small caliber magazine is for the gun.
[698.72s -> 707.50s]  Craft a shovel. Oh, I need tape and I can do this right now. Tape.
[707.50s -> 715.31s]  All right. Does this guy have tape? You got tape, right?
[715.31s -> 732.08s]  Well, how much money do I have? He's got tape. This is awesome. All right. I can actually make the shovel.
[732.08s -> 739.57s]  I do need to upgrade my workshop to craft this. What are you talking about?
[739.57s -> 747.11s]  I need to upgrade my work to what? Why? I need to upgrade my workshop.
[747.11s -> 753.45s]  I need to know. Didn't I just do this? I need another toolbox.
[753.45s -> 757.45s]  OK, well, shovel materials are going up here. I need the stick.
[757.45s -> 764.52s]  This will eventually make shovel. I need five toolboxes. That would be horrible if that were true.
[764.52s -> 772.62s]  Torch. I got to prepare this. Do I have enough? I need five needles.
[772.62s -> 782.13s]  It's like you pay for a service, right? I paid for the guy who was supposed to deliver my shit here.
[782.13s -> 786.13s]  And he just threw it on a bag. I had it all alphabetical order.
[786.13s -> 790.13s]  And he just threw it on the bag and just dropped it in front of my house because I have to do this again now.
[790.13s -> 795.74s]  All right. Fan belt is probably going to be miscellaneous.
[795.74s -> 799.74s]  Tire would be miscellaneous. Battery electronics go up here.
[799.74s -> 807.38s]  All right. This is OK. Shiny stone is not electronics. I'm just going to sell it.
[807.38s -> 813.77s]  This is miscellaneous to the wood. All right. This looks all right. I'm OK with this.
[813.77s -> 826.05s]  Weapons, fire, consumables, like the tire. I could put that up there, too.
[826.05s -> 834.58s]  This is all right. Now, I need to board up a bunch of these windows.
[834.58s -> 841.58s]  That was what I was going to do last time before extreme fatigue put in after playing this game for six hours.
[841.58s -> 847.58s]  Now that I'm fresh, I'm awoken. Almost just spilled the coffee completely off my lap.
[847.58s -> 856.83s]  We're organized. Is my first time playing Darkwood? Yes.
[856.83s -> 862.95s]  I started it yesterday. It's the second time I've ever technically sat down to play it.
[862.95s -> 873.10s]  All right, let's go. I need some needles. I have how many traps do I have? Bear trap.
[873.10s -> 879.73s]  How many windows do we got? What does it take? I need three wood and seven needles.
[879.73s -> 884.73s]  I'm going to have to go back on a wood hunt. Where's that thing? I can do this. I got some wood here.
[884.73s -> 892.90s]  How many is this going to make? Wait and get the needles first before he leaves.
[892.90s -> 900.61s]  How many does he have? Nail. I just got to get a bunch of them. I have to do this. I need it.
[900.61s -> 914.74s]  Just give me all of them. He's late. I've been streaming for 15 minutes. He's late.
[914.74s -> 924.04s]  All right. This generator is still on. No, it's not. It is.
[924.04s -> 934.13s]  God damn it. Let's make some planks. So I got like 20 of these now.
[934.13s -> 945.71s]  Still frozen time. That's good. All right. I need to get all these boarded up.
[945.71s -> 949.71s]  But I need to repair this. All right. Let me think about this for a second.
[949.71s -> 955.28s]  Now, don't build a bathtub. So this is I can't do anything about this.
[955.28s -> 959.28s]  So they're always going to get into here, right? So if they're always going to get into there,
[959.28s -> 963.28s]  that means I have to take care of I have to get one spot that I know I'm going to stay in.
[963.28s -> 968.16s]  Where are the lamps? Build. I'm not building a bathtub.
[968.16s -> 972.72s]  OK, there's a window. This looks all right. I don't mind this spot.
[972.72s -> 976.72s]  But then I have to deal with this. What about the bedroom?
[976.72s -> 983.70s]  This is all right, too. But there's two entry ways. And then there's in this room.
[983.70s -> 987.70s]  And there's only. Yeah. OK. This is the room right here.
[987.70s -> 999.56s]  This one. Let's go for it. All right. That's boarded up.
[999.56s -> 1002.99s]  I can go around here, board this one up, too.
[1002.99s -> 1008.77s]  I will have two rooms to play with here because then I just have to worry about the up up top here.
[1008.77s -> 1015.10s]  Oh, there's bread in here. Nice. Because I could care less if they get in up here.
[1015.10s -> 1019.10s]  I just don't want to get in here or here. That means you trap it up.
[1019.10s -> 1023.61s]  Let's drag this table. I came prepared today, guys.
[1023.61s -> 1029.64s]  You thought I was going to be a clown today. No, not today.
[1029.64s -> 1049.14s]  It was that why even drag the table?
[1049.14s -> 1052.51s]  This is so much easier to do that like this.
[1052.51s -> 1059.32s]  Just push it. All right. So that will block off.
[1059.32s -> 1062.32s]  Will it block this whole thing? It will not.
[1062.32s -> 1067.26s]  So I need to be aware of that. We've got to have table here.
[1067.26s -> 1075.22s]  There's a sofa. Let's move the sofa. I'm thinking maybe a bathtub.
[1075.22s -> 1082.78s]  Because then this is good. I'm thinking bathtub right back here, too.
[1082.78s -> 1093.19s]  All right. Let's make a bathtub. I'm not going to say it.
[1093.19s -> 1103.37s]  I just wanted there to be a mess over here. How am I going to get in?
[1103.37s -> 1109.50s]  I will have it so I can move it in a particular way, very, very small, like a puzzle.
[1109.50s -> 1115.28s]  So if you see a puzzle for the first time, you don't know the solution to the puzzle.
[1115.28s -> 1122.28s]  But if you made the puzzle, if you created the puzzle, you just turn that table 14 degrees clockwise.
[1122.28s -> 1128.29s]  And I get in. I am the puzzle maker, not the puzzle taker.
[1128.29s -> 1133.23s]  So for instance, it could just be as simple as drag this up like this.
[1133.23s -> 1136.23s]  Done. Puzzle's complete. And then I make it through here.
[1136.23s -> 1139.23s]  And then I just pull it back down. I don't know. Something like that.
[1139.23s -> 1142.23s]  All right. I got two boarded windows. I need my traps.
[1142.23s -> 1146.03s]  How many do I have? Zero. I need to make them.
[1146.03s -> 1156.66s]  I need to get a door. I can't. How do you mean? I can't make it.
[1156.66s -> 1167.17s]  Can you make a door? Can I take the door off from here?
[1167.17s -> 1173.46s]  I'll barricade this door. I need more needles. What?
[1173.46s -> 1181.89s]  All right. This also has to come into the other room.
[1181.89s -> 1186.58s]  I got to get this in here. This is where I'm going to get ready.
[1186.58s -> 1192.54s]  If the time is frozen right now. So I got all as much time as I need.
[1192.54s -> 1200.97s]  We're going to do this the way that I should have done it in the first place.
[1200.97s -> 1209.01s]  And that's just walk into it. I don't, you know, it doesn't need to.
[1209.01s -> 1214.10s]  I can, I can do the puzzle maker after it's pulled through.
[1214.10s -> 1221.66s]  I got to get this set up. It's important. If I could survive a night here.
[1221.66s -> 1228.71s]  And that's the plan. Boarded windows, put traps along.
[1228.71s -> 1233.79s]  I'm going to put traps here too. I'll be ready.
[1233.79s -> 1236.79s]  There's one lamp. Where's the other ones? There's one in here. That's fine.
[1236.79s -> 1240.79s]  Get it away from the windows though. I remember that message from last night.
[1240.79s -> 1246.74s]  That's get this away from the windows because the light will shine through.
[1246.74s -> 1253.88s]  So we're not going to put it near the windows. Okay. This is new.
[1253.88s -> 1258.34s]  We're going to put this in the corner. I need a good lamp placement.
[1258.34s -> 1262.02s]  So it doesn't shine completely through these windows.
[1262.02s -> 1265.02s]  I'm going to say this corner up here and I'll block it with a sofa.
[1265.02s -> 1274.73s]  Sounds good. Right there should be all right. I got one there.
[1274.73s -> 1278.99s]  I got one here, maybe a little bit into this.
[1278.99s -> 1281.99s]  Maybe up here a little. Still shining through a little bit.
[1281.99s -> 1286.51s]  I think it's all right. What about the?
[1286.51s -> 1289.88s]  I think that's fine. That should be okay.
[1289.88s -> 1293.31s]  Two lamps and a bathtub. They have no chance.
[1293.31s -> 1296.49s]  I also have this too. Can I move this?
[1296.49s -> 1301.57s]  I can't drag the table. Whatever.
[1301.57s -> 1304.81s]  All right. I need to make traps. I need more nails, which I don't have.
[1304.81s -> 1309.52s]  All right. Where do I get nails?
[1309.52s -> 1314.09s]  No, don't repair the doorway. Where do you get nails?
[1314.09s -> 1324.94s]  At the hardware store. I'm talking about. Yeah. Okay.
[1324.94s -> 1330.15s]  I have six.
[1330.15s -> 1334.16s]  I bought the whole store worth of nails.
[1334.16s -> 1339.96s]  Really should repair the door. I need another nail. I don't have any.
[1339.96s -> 1342.96s]  I have to just kind of explore and look for some nails.
[1342.96s -> 1346.52s]  And wood too, because I'm out of that.
[1346.52s -> 1351.17s]  Or am I? That was kind of a waste of money, but it's okay.
[1351.17s -> 1355.37s]  I need to repair my board.
[1355.37s -> 1360.40s]  Game is quiet.
[1360.40s -> 1363.40s]  Oh, shit. Hold on. I'll fix that.
[1363.40s -> 1375.70s]  Game's quiet.
[1375.70s -> 1379.13s]  All right. Still haven't spent any time.
[1379.13s -> 1384.22s]  I need to repair this.
[1384.22s -> 1388.42s]  I should have enough, right? I do. All right.
[1388.42s -> 1391.42s]  Crude weapon. I've got some gasoline that I'm going to just store.
[1391.42s -> 1395.35s]  I don't need it right now.
[1395.35s -> 1401.65s]  Get rid of these boards.
[1401.65s -> 1404.65s]  I mean, I'll keep the bread on me. I'll keep the torch on me.
[1404.65s -> 1410.77s]  I could sell the scrap metal. I could sell the shiny stone.
[1410.77s -> 1416.50s]  Yeah, let's do that. Might as well. I heard something.
[1416.50s -> 1419.94s]  If you take too long, does like the bubble bobble ghost
[1419.94s -> 1423.82s]  come and get you if you take too long here?
[1423.82s -> 1430.51s]  Can somebody confirm that with me, please? No. Yes.
[1430.51s -> 1446.39s]  All right. Well, I think I'm fine.
[1446.39s -> 1449.39s]  All right. Time to go look for wood. I am in the silent forest.
[1449.39s -> 1452.39s]  So might as well look for wood. I have to get wood and nails
[1452.39s -> 1455.39s]  or I'm guaranteed to lose.
[1455.39s -> 1458.39s]  If I go off on a tangent here, stop talking about keyboards.
[1458.39s -> 1461.39s]  If I bring up the dream I had last night, I want you to
[1461.39s -> 1464.39s]  spam Jerma Sauer in the chat
[1464.39s -> 1467.70s]  because I cannot mess around tonight.
[1467.70s -> 1471.13s]  I have to go do this right now.
[1471.13s -> 1474.13s]  Do not let me talk about anything else besides
[1474.13s -> 1477.13s]  did I collect wood or did I collect nails?
[1477.13s -> 1485.34s]  All right. I'm going to go up to the camp
[1485.34s -> 1488.34s]  because there was still stuff up there that I needed to get and
[1488.34s -> 1495.04s]  I'll pick bread. All right. OK.
[1495.04s -> 1498.04s]  I don't need this gasoline here. It's wasting inventory space.
[1498.04s -> 1504.42s]  How do you do Jerma Sauer? You got to be a subscriber to the channel.
[1504.42s -> 1507.42s]  Tier one. And then you do Jerma
[1507.42s -> 1510.42s]  lowercase and then uppercase S and then lowercase
[1510.42s -> 1513.42s]  hour. But switch the O and the U.
[1513.42s -> 1516.42s]  So it's your. But if you say, you know what I mean, you figure it out.
[1516.42s -> 1519.42s]  All right. What was I doing? Gasoline.
[1519.42s -> 1522.91s]  I got plenty of gas. This is fine. All right. I'm ready.
[1522.91s -> 1528.38s]  Wait. I also need a bunch of scrap metal too
[1528.38s -> 1531.38s]  because I make a shitload of these. All right. I'm ready. Let's go up to the camp.
[1531.38s -> 1534.38s]  I got my board. I remember how to play.
[1534.38s -> 1537.38s]  Maybe that's
[1537.38s -> 1540.38s]  kind of it. I don't think that's actually true.
[1540.38s -> 1543.38s]  And we found wood automatically right up here. Oh, my
[1543.38s -> 1546.38s]  God. Thank goodness.
[1546.38s -> 1549.38s]  Only one pile. Come on. Make it easy
[1549.38s -> 1552.38s]  for me. It took me 40 minutes when I played
[1552.38s -> 1555.38s]  yesterday to figure out where the hell this stuff was in the first place.
[1555.38s -> 1560.52s]  That's so dark. 8 a.m.
[1560.52s -> 1565.02s]  All right. This camp had some stuff. Yeah. There's some rocks
[1565.02s -> 1569.42s]  here. I remember I was freaking out. Everyone was telling
[1569.42s -> 1572.42s]  me, just go, just go. You can come back. You can come back so I can come back. I'm fine.
[1572.42s -> 1577.24s]  Stick here. I might just turn around
[1577.24s -> 1580.24s]  immediately and just dump the stuff back in the stash.
[1580.24s -> 1585.85s]  Oh, nice. Absolutely beautiful.
[1585.85s -> 1602.19s]  Someone's walking around. All right. I'm going to let's
[1602.19s -> 1606.78s]  deposit it right now. Oh, OK.
[1606.78s -> 1609.78s]  It's just a it's a rock throw. That's a throw. The guy throws rocks.
[1609.78s -> 1616.46s]  Come on. Throw a rock. Throw.
[1616.46s -> 1622.75s]  That was a pretty good dodge, she asked me.
[1622.75s -> 1627.34s]  Wait, he doesn't wait. What? I thought he just threw rocks.
[1627.34s -> 1631.34s]  I just got baited.
[1631.34s -> 1638.92s]  I thought he just threw rocks. OK, I get a deposit.
[1638.92s -> 1646.96s]  It's only been one hour. This is good.
[1646.96s -> 1649.96s]  This is my house. Yeah, right. It is.
[1649.96s -> 1654.16s]  All right. Get rid of this stuff right now. So we got a
[1654.16s -> 1657.40s]  rocks, staff, bottle, rag.
[1657.40s -> 1660.40s]  I don't have any healing potions.
[1660.40s -> 1663.40s]  I don't have any healing potion drenched gauze.
[1663.40s -> 1667.09s]  Meat, match, wire. OK.
[1667.09s -> 1670.39s]  I need to make some bandages because I don't have any.
[1670.39s -> 1673.70s]  I have two of the big ones, but I'm not going to use those.
[1673.70s -> 1678.14s]  That would be a mistake. Take your shirt off.
[1678.14s -> 1690.78s]  I unironically banned that person for five minutes.
[1690.78s -> 1694.34s]  How do you unironically ban somebody?
[1694.34s -> 1704.67s]  Don't you just ban somebody? All right, hold on.
[1704.67s -> 1711.22s]  I just want to have bandages with me.
[1711.22s -> 1714.22s]  Yes, we're good. I'll keep the bread, too. All right, back out.
[1714.22s -> 1717.22s]  Nails. Deposit the nails just in case I die. Nails.
[1717.22s -> 1720.98s]  What if I lose? All right.
[1720.98s -> 1725.30s]  And this thing's almost broken. All right, back out.
[1725.30s -> 1728.30s]  I'm going to explore to the left because there's a wolf's camp.
[1728.30s -> 1731.30s]  Piotrek's house is over this way, and there's probably lots of wood and stuff to collect.
[1731.30s -> 1738.16s]  Fucking battery in here. The heck.
[1738.16s -> 1742.81s]  OK, I also have a gun. I need to get to...
[1742.81s -> 1746.24s]  Remember, if you see a toolbox, spam JermaToolbox in the chat.
[1746.24s -> 1763.94s]  That's my new emote. Guy right there.
[1763.94s -> 1780.29s]  I take it. Of course I do.
[1780.29s -> 1791.58s]  I couldn't see it. There he is.
[1791.58s -> 1794.58s]  All right. All right. Is he throwing rocks or what?
[1794.58s -> 1799.16s]  Is this a rock person? I can't tell.
[1799.16s -> 1802.16s]  I think it's a rock person. Yep. I stepped in the poison mushrooms.
[1802.16s -> 1805.34s]  Again. Oh, my.
[1805.34s -> 1809.86s]  They blend in really well here.
[1809.86s -> 1815.59s]  They blend in so well. This is bad.
[1815.59s -> 1853.36s]  Silo. Plague doctor here?
[1853.36s -> 1856.36s]  I've said it before and I'll say it again. There are only two people
[1856.36s -> 1859.36s]  that listen to classical music like this.
[1859.36s -> 1862.54s]  That's the dentist and serial killers.
[1862.54s -> 1898.72s]  No, I can't turn this off because it's going to be like,
[1898.72s -> 1901.72s]  who turned off my gramophone?
[1901.72s -> 1917.04s]  I'll endure it for now.
[1917.04s -> 1928.98s]  That's what happens when you do stuff like this.
[1928.98s -> 1933.95s]  There's a bed over here.
[1933.95s -> 1947.80s]  Oh, shit. OK, hold on.
[1947.80s -> 1953.86s]  There's a chest. Something good. Something really good.
[1953.86s -> 1960.60s]  Dead rat. Why would I have... That's the first time I've seen that.
[1960.60s -> 1966.27s]  Dead rat? Check the other side.
[1966.27s -> 1985.18s]  All right. I'm going to do it. I guess it's just playing.
[1985.18s -> 1993.09s]  I can't turn it off. OK, maybe I'll come back here later.
[1993.09s -> 1996.39s]  Wood and sticks.
[1996.39s -> 2003.20s]  Nothing else. Right?
[2003.20s -> 2006.20s]  Wood and nails. Nothing else. Wood and nails.
[2006.20s -> 2011.98s]  All right. Come on. Break it.
[2011.98s -> 2015.74s]  Wood and nails. Wood and nails.
[2015.74s -> 2022.35s]  I'm supposed to be getting wood and nails. What am I breaking?
[2022.35s -> 2028.01s]  Break what? What am I breaking?
[2028.01s -> 2034.70s]  Smash it. Smash the gramophone.
[2034.70s -> 2042.49s]  You guys are supposed to keep me on the wood and nails only run.
[2042.49s -> 2048.93s]  Nowhere it has gone by.
[2048.93s -> 2052.49s]  I can only hit something like two or three more times before this is broken.
[2052.49s -> 2059.49s]  Keep that in mind. What's this? Corp?
[2059.49s -> 2062.79s]  Chicken head. Bear trap. Nice.
[2062.79s -> 2065.79s]  Alcohol and a bottle. I'm out of room.
[2065.79s -> 2070.57s]  I might have to go back, but I need nails.
[2070.57s -> 2075.02s]  Bad. Really badly.
[2075.02s -> 2086.76s]  Can I burn this? Damn it.
[2086.76s -> 2097.68s]  I have to go back at like 15 and figure out...
[2097.68s -> 2102.38s]  There's a tank. He's got me nails in here.
[2102.38s -> 2117.12s]  Right? No, this is the silo.
[2117.12s -> 2125.53s]  How many are there? Can I throw a bottle at his head?
[2125.53s -> 2137.97s]  Wait a minute. I just did.
[2137.97s -> 2140.97s]  Oh, this is not good. There's something over here though.
[2140.97s -> 2153.92s]  Whoa!
[2153.92s -> 2157.99s]  Kill him. Kill him. You do it. You do it.
[2157.99s -> 2161.47s]  Get him. Help me, please.
[2161.47s -> 2166.36s]  Kill that guy.
[2166.36s -> 2170.24s]  Please. All right. One's dead.
[2170.24s -> 2174.18s]  I'm trying to line it up. Good.
[2174.18s -> 2177.87s]  Okay. Now I gotta go.
[2177.87s -> 2180.87s]  I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go.
[2180.87s -> 2198.43s]  Tank wreck. A wreck of a World War II tank.
[2198.43s -> 2201.43s]  That's it? Knife. Don't put the watch away.
[2201.43s -> 2204.43s]  Gasoline. Don't need it. Fabric.
[2204.43s -> 2207.43s]  Throw away the stones. I don't care. It's fabric.
[2207.43s -> 2210.80s]  Battery. Gasoline.
[2210.80s -> 2215.42s]  Take the battery. And then...
[2215.42s -> 2219.04s]  Get rid of the rag. No. Just make something.
[2219.04s -> 2225.08s]  Throw away the dead rats. Do I need them?
[2225.08s -> 2232.03s]  Sure I don't need them. Keep them.
[2232.03s -> 2235.03s]  It's a dead rat. I know, but what if I need them?
[2235.03s -> 2238.03s]  There might be some recipe. I don't need the gasoline. I'm fine.
[2238.03s -> 2242.30s]  Okay, I have a knife now. But, okay, where is that beast?
[2242.30s -> 2246.24s]  I gotta look at what you have on you. Just a stick. Who cares?
[2246.24s -> 2249.48s]  I want that alcohol.
[2249.48s -> 2253.62s]  I can take it. Okay. Hold on.
[2253.62s -> 2262.68s]  Rag. Stick. Who cares?
[2262.68s -> 2269.42s]  I need to go back.
[2269.42s -> 2272.86s]  No, where's the wolf? I gotta go to wolf camp.
[2272.86s -> 2277.18s]  And buy nails.
[2277.18s -> 2280.18s]  No, that's far. How far away is that?
[2280.18s -> 2294.48s]  That might be too far away.
[2294.48s -> 2298.17s]  16. I need enough time to get back. I'm gonna go for it.
[2298.17s -> 2319.49s]  Okay, I have to leave.
[2319.49s -> 2323.18s]  I have to leave. I have to leave right now.
[2323.18s -> 2326.18s]  Bear traps in this game is like dig... You cannot run in a straight line in this game.
[2326.18s -> 2329.18s]  It's like digging down in Minecraft.
[2329.18s -> 2338.50s]  I have to go back. I have to deal with it.
[2338.50s -> 2343.14s]  I need a pile of wood. I need nails.
[2343.14s -> 2350.34s]  I might be able to survive. It's possible.
[2350.34s -> 2353.34s]  I just have to really get boarded up and get ready and stab somebody with a knife.
[2353.34s -> 2368.02s]  Let me see what I can do here.
[2368.02s -> 2371.38s]  Boarded. This is open, but it's okay. They're gonna come through here anyways.
[2371.38s -> 2374.38s]  Alright, let me deposit the mushrooms. I still have about...
[2374.38s -> 2380.57s]  I have two hours or so to figure this out.
[2380.57s -> 2384.00s]  So we've got 40 essence. 40 essence. Nice.
[2384.00s -> 2388.58s]  Not bad.
[2388.58s -> 2392.34s]  Okay, here we go. Battery.
[2392.34s -> 2395.34s]  I still have wood. Chicken head.
[2395.34s -> 2398.90s]  Scrap metal. Dead rats. Bear trap. I need that one.
[2398.90s -> 2401.90s]  Fabric. Keep the bandages. Actually... No!
[2401.90s -> 2404.90s]  Wait, I don't have a well here.
[2404.90s -> 2415.35s]  Okay, cool. Lantern.
[2415.35s -> 2420.45s]  Should I do this?
[2420.45s -> 2429.37s]  Inventory upgrade.
[2429.37s -> 2432.99s]  I know I'm doing that one.
[2432.99s -> 2437.70s]  Now I want to do bear trap.
[2437.70s -> 2440.70s]  I don't have any bookies. Stop. Bear trap. Bear trap.
[2440.70s -> 2454.94s]  I want four bear traps. Make advantage.
[2454.94s -> 2460.74s]  I still have alcohol. Store it.
[2460.74s -> 2464.10s]  Get rid of the wood too. Alright, now I can do this later.
[2464.10s -> 2467.10s]  Prepare this.
[2467.10s -> 2470.98s]  To me, use this as a melee weapon of throne.
[2470.98s -> 2473.98s]  I'm gonna have to just use the knife and get rid of the bottles.
[2473.98s -> 2478.50s]  Okay, set these up. Cook the rats.
[2478.50s -> 2482.75s]  Cook the rats? Are you serious?
[2482.75s -> 2496.47s]  Alright, chicken head rats.
[2496.47s -> 2502.08s]  You guys want me to throw those away?
[2502.08s -> 2505.08s]  Wow, imagine if I threw those away? How much of a mistake that would be?
[2505.08s -> 2509.02s]  Holy god.
[2509.02s -> 2512.20s]  I think that's enough. I have a bandage.
[2512.20s -> 2515.44s]  Stand next to electricity light.
[2515.44s -> 2519.90s]  I'm gonna go for it. Okay, let's do it.
[2519.90s -> 2524.93s]  So, I need to turn the generator on. Now.
[2524.93s -> 2533.59s]  Generator on. Boink.
[2533.59s -> 2540.74s]  Get back over here. This is where we have to figure this out.
[2540.74s -> 2544.04s]  Alright, now I need to survive in these two rooms.
[2544.04s -> 2551.06s]  Bear trap. Right here.
[2551.06s -> 2565.67s]  Okay. Bear trap here, bear trap there.
[2565.67s -> 2575.42s]  Good. Alright. In here too?
[2575.42s -> 2579.30s]  I need... Why is this wall glowing?
[2579.30s -> 2584.58s]  Okay, bear trap here.
[2584.58s -> 2591.34s]  You know what? No, no, no. Bear trap.
[2591.34s -> 2595.22s]  I don't know. It's gonna have to be like right here.
[2595.22s -> 2598.58s]  Yeah, I have to hang out in this room. There's gonna be a bear trap here.
[2598.58s -> 2601.58s]  First of all... Ah, I'm running out of time, running out of time. There's no more time left.
[2601.58s -> 2604.95s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2604.95s -> 2609.60s]  Get the bathtub in the... Hurry up. Drag the table.
[2609.60s -> 2651.56s]  No, not long ways. I have 30 minutes.
[2651.56s -> 2655.44s]  Light. This is a light source. Why am I not being healed?
[2655.44s -> 2687.85s]  This is an electricity light source? What? Why?
[2687.85s -> 2690.85s]  This is in case somebody gets in here. This is in case somebody gets in this way.
[2690.85s -> 2697.35s]  They're boarded though. A little bit of light's bleeding through, but I think it's okay.
[2697.35s -> 2702.45s]  They're in the house right now. Okay.
[2702.45s -> 2705.45s]  He's in the house. He's in the house right now.
[2705.45s -> 2708.45s]  He didn't get... Step on the trap. Don't...
[2708.45s -> 2711.62s]  Why is he not getting stuck on the traps?
[2711.62s -> 2714.62s]  Why is he not getting stuck on the traps?
[2714.62s -> 2729.18s]  He's avoiding all of them.
[2729.18s -> 2732.59s]  Wait, what? My knife. Huh? Heal.
[2732.59s -> 2742.98s]  The trap was underneath the sofa.
[2742.98s -> 2749.81s]  Oh, fuck. He's coming in.
[2749.81s -> 2752.81s]  Give me the scrap. I don't know what to do. He didn't even step on any of them.
[2752.81s -> 2776.78s]  I'm just gonna go like this and just put weight here so he can't open it.
[2776.78s -> 2780.73s]  You know what I mean? Like he can't push me over.
[2780.73s -> 2814.74s]  They're gonna turn the light off. Wait, are they gonna get doubled?
[2814.74s -> 2832.36s]  Are they gonna get doubled? Don't turn the lights off. Both of them.
[2832.36s -> 2868.86s]  Nah, I can't take a sip of my coffee yet.
[2868.86s -> 2872.36s]  Something else has to go here. That says to be traps.
[2872.36s -> 2881.30s]  Furniture is useless. 6 AM. Come on.
[2881.30s -> 2889.90s]  God. Oh, God damn it.
[2889.90s -> 2900.22s]  Give me a torch. Get out of here.
[2900.22s -> 2914.90s]  Back! Press Q to use moth.
[2914.90s -> 2920.13s]  Oh. Furniture is absolutely useless.
[2920.13s -> 2923.13s]  Get rid of all of this and we're gonna do like three traps here.
[2923.13s -> 2935.65s]  They just walk into the traps. Can I pick these up?
[2935.65s -> 2938.82s]  This arm. I'm gonna leave them there though.
[2938.82s -> 2941.82s]  These are okay. I actually don't mind these where they are. I don't have to go in this room for any reason.
[2941.82s -> 2946.78s]  I'm fine.
[2946.78s -> 2953.15s]  That was a stress gas that came up.
[2953.15s -> 2956.46s]  Okay. Search this already. Let's go back.
[2956.46s -> 2961.81s]  Nails. You got nails for me. Yes, you do. I know you do.
[2961.81s -> 2969.08s]  But do I want them? I mean, yes, I kind of do.
[2969.08s -> 2977.68s]  I kind of need them. Give me all of them.
[2977.68s -> 2983.46s]  All these. I'll take the mushroom too.
[2983.46s -> 2986.70s]  You know what? No, that's a waste.
[2986.70s -> 2989.70s]  Gotta go find one.
[2989.70s -> 2992.70s]  And I've already got tape for the shovel, but I need the toolbox.
[2992.70s -> 2997.10s]  I need to go back to the wolf. I'm gonna refill everything.
[2997.10s -> 3004.18s]  Okay. Let's check this out now.
[3004.18s -> 3008.44s]  Now that I have a minute. I might come back and buy the scrap too.
[3008.44s -> 3011.44s]  Because I need it for the traps. In fact, I'm just gonna get it now.
[3011.44s -> 3014.44s]  Because I know I'm gonna need it.
[3014.44s -> 3018.51s]  Let us do a fun little thing here called.
[3018.51s -> 3021.51s]  Board up the remaining windows.
[3021.51s -> 3024.51s]  Or repair door. You know, this is not a bad idea.
[3024.51s -> 3029.74s]  But first.
[3029.74s -> 3032.74s]  The furniture is stupid.
[3032.74s -> 3037.83s]  I don't even know why I have a bathtub.
[3037.83s -> 3045.34s]  It doesn't do anything for me.
[3045.34s -> 3048.78s]  Bathtub just gets in the way. And I wasted stuff on this.
[3048.78s -> 3051.78s]  Alright. Chair can go over here.
[3054.36s -> 3057.36s]  So I got one in front of the window. I want one, two, three here.
[3057.36s -> 3061.29s]  Can I make them? I think so.
[3061.29s -> 3068.35s]  Back to the workshop for a second.
[3068.35s -> 3073.51s]  I don't have anything to cook. No. I almost have another level up though.
[3073.51s -> 3077.52s]  Alright. Bear trap. Three, six, nine, twelve.
[3077.52s -> 3085.34s]  I can make four of these. One, two, three, four.
[3085.34s -> 3090.11s]  Turn off the generator. Thank you.
[3090.11s -> 3093.42s]  Thank you for reminding me about the generator.
[3093.42s -> 3124.37s]  Appreciate it.
[3124.37s -> 3141.43s]  There's a hole in that wall. I can repair that.
[3141.43s -> 3144.43s]  I can reinforce this door.
[3144.43s -> 3147.93s]  Wooden door. No.
[3147.93s -> 3151.49s]  I can't. But only one trap has to go here.
[3151.49s -> 3158.70s]  Check this out. Yeah. Okay.
[3158.70s -> 3165.14s]  There's only one point of entry here. I'm gonna try it.
[3165.14s -> 3168.14s]  Whatever. If it's wrong, it's wrong. If it's wrong, it's wrong.
[3168.14s -> 3171.14s]  It's smaller. It's less places to get in.
[3171.14s -> 3175.34s]  I'm gonna dismantle all the stuff that I've done.
[3175.34s -> 3180.29s]  Now it's too late. I already have this set up.
[3180.29s -> 3183.29s]  Now this is alright. It really is just this one point of entry right here.
[3183.29s -> 3186.29s]  And that, potentially. Whatever that is.
[3186.29s -> 3195.21s]  Why is this counting up? 46, 40. What are you doing?
[3195.21s -> 3198.21s]  If I dismantle this trap, can I pick it up?
[3198.21s -> 3201.21s]  Or does it turn into scrap? I need to find out. I need to learn on my own.
[3201.21s -> 3218.46s]  It's alright. But is it the same amount of scrap?
[3218.46s -> 3221.46s]  I need to learn on my own. I have to make mistakes.
[3221.46s -> 3224.46s]  Two scrap metal. What does it cost to make one? Two or three.
[3224.46s -> 3228.28s]  It's half of what it is. Alright, so I'm gonna...
[3228.28s -> 3231.28s]  Shit. Okay, that's fine. Whatever. Don't worry.
[3231.28s -> 3237.32s]  I gotta make my mistakes. Let's see how this plays out.
[3237.32s -> 3243.36s]  In here. Got this one spot.
[3243.36s -> 3246.36s]  The barricade.
[3246.36s -> 3249.36s]  I don't have any... How do I not have any logs?
[3249.36s -> 3255.98s]  What the hell are you talking about? Why? What are you guys doing?
[3255.98s -> 3258.98s]  Why are you guys counting up? Why? What's with the counting?
[3258.98s -> 3263.24s]  What happened? I don't understand why this is happening.
[3263.24s -> 3271.73s]  Alright, wood. Wooden planks.
[3271.73s -> 3274.73s]  Wooden planks.
[3274.73s -> 3277.73s]  Any more wooden planks in here?
[3277.73s -> 3280.73s]  I'm gonna take the gasoline and dump it.
[3280.73s -> 3284.86s]  I'm gonna make another bear trap.
[3284.86s -> 3291.37s]  Alright, one, two, three, five bear traps.
[3291.37s -> 3294.74s]  I can make another weapon. No, why would I do that?
[3294.74s -> 3300.14s]  Make a bandage again? Okay.
[3300.14s -> 3303.63s]  Got two lockpicks. Pretty sick.
[3303.63s -> 3311.10s]  I got a mushroom. Let's deposit that.
[3311.10s -> 3314.10s]  You guys aren't gonna make me put this in subscriber only mode, are you?
[3314.10s -> 3332.87s]  It'll get worse.
[3332.87s -> 3337.97s]  Don't make me use that power.
[3337.97s -> 3341.34s]  Okay, wait, you have a mushroom for sale, don't you? What if I'm lazy?
[3341.34s -> 3357.36s]  I'm lazy. Let's level up.
[3357.36s -> 3363.34s]  Okay. My...
[3363.34s -> 3369.07s]  My blood will hurt enemies.
[3369.07s -> 3372.07s]  Once a day for about a minute, I will be able to see all around me.
[3372.07s -> 3378.19s]  Once a day, I'll be able to run for a short amount of time without losing stamina.
[3378.19s -> 3384.25s]  My vulnerability to poison increases.
[3384.25s -> 3387.25s]  My sight will get worse for a short amount of time when I receive damage.
[3387.25s -> 3391.26s]  That's not good. This is also not good.
[3391.26s -> 3399.30s]  Because I step in these every time.
[3399.30s -> 3409.62s]  I don't know what's the right call here. I kinda like this.
[3409.62s -> 3414.91s]  When I take damage, I don't know what that means.
[3414.91s -> 3417.91s]  I step in poison mushrooms every time they're around.
[3417.91s -> 3420.91s]  So I don't know how much worse that's gonna be.
[3420.91s -> 3429.83s]  Runner is really good.
[3429.83s -> 3436.78s]  Does that just randomly happen?
[3436.78s -> 3445.66s]  So randomly, it turns on a super power.
[3445.66s -> 3449.66s]  If I can activate that, that's really good.
[3449.66s -> 3452.66s]  I like that, because then I can just sprint away from anything.
[3452.66s -> 3459.17s]  Yeah, that's this one.
[3459.17s -> 3465.08s]  Just don't step in the poison mushrooms, Jeremy. Seriously.
[3465.08s -> 3481.41s]  Just don't.
[3481.41s -> 3497.82s]  I'm gonna be fine. I have heals. Yeah, I got heals.
[3498.82s -> 3502.82s]  It's the goose game.
[3502.82s -> 3513.62s]  The sound still resonates inside this mossy bell.
[3513.62s -> 3533.29s]  It's a sword. A sword castle.
[3533.29s -> 3536.59s]  I want them to think I'm stupid.
[3536.59s -> 3540.41s]  Alright, so we've got...
[3540.41s -> 3549.15s]  Come on in. Get in line.
[3549.15s -> 3554.38s]  Think. I want them to think I'm stupid.
[3554.38s -> 3558.45s]  I want that person to not be able to talk for the next eight minutes.
[3558.45s -> 3561.45s]  I want that person to not be able to talk for one of the eight deadly sins.
[3562.45s -> 3569.40s]  Greed. Gluttony. Lust. Wrath.
[3569.40s -> 3582.53s]  What? How is he doing that?
[3582.53s -> 3586.47s]  He's pulling his thumb off!
[3586.47s -> 3593.41s]  Whoa! Pride, as you just saw.
[3593.41s -> 3606.42s]  Lust. Wrath. Sloth.
[3606.42s -> 3612.80s]  Greed. Gluttony. Pride. Lust. Sloth. Wrath.
[3612.80s -> 3621.46s]  What's that on? Lust. Greed. Gluttony.
[3621.46s -> 3624.46s]  I've done this before. Yes, I've done this before. I remember this.
[3624.46s -> 3628.22s]  I remember trying to do the seven deadly sins.
[3628.22s -> 3641.82s]  Envy. There it is.
[3641.82s -> 3648.71s]  What if I don't touch it?
[3648.71s -> 3655.92s]  Just prepare the doorway of my dream.
[3655.92s -> 3673.50s]  You see there's a line. Where the hell are you going?
[3673.50s -> 3690.16s]  Alright, fine.
[3690.16s -> 3706.46s]  Was it already on it?
[3706.46s -> 3710.53s]  Lockpick. Can I just lockpick?
[3710.53s -> 3713.53s]  Do I have to get in line and listen to them talk?
[3713.53s -> 3723.87s]  Don't barricade the door.
[3723.87s -> 3733.06s]  I remember the lockpick.
[3733.06s -> 3737.44s]  An axe and a strange box.
[3737.44s -> 3743.24s]  It's covered in scratches.
[3743.24s -> 3752.34s]  I have a weapon now.
[3752.34s -> 3770.36s]  You suck.
[3770.36s -> 3774.82s]  It's a scripted event, guys. That's a script.
[3774.82s -> 3780.10s]  I don't suck. I don't suck at reading a script.
[3780.10s -> 3783.73s]  What did I just do that for?
[3783.73s -> 3786.73s]  I thought this was my inventory.
[3786.73s -> 3789.73s]  That sucks. I'm just buying everything.
[3789.73s -> 3801.14s]  I was in the middle of doing something.
[3801.14s -> 3805.02s]  Oh, wait. It's the wolf man.
[3827.02s -> 3830.02s]  The selfish bitch is keeping something that does not belong to her
[3830.02s -> 3833.02s]  behind the locked door in her house.
[3833.02s -> 3836.02s]  Something I'm after, bring me the key to that door
[3836.02s -> 3839.02s]  and I'll tell you where to find the thing you lost.
[3839.02s -> 3842.38s]  Is this fair, comrade? A key for a key.
[3842.38s -> 3849.46s]  Ha. Good. Now take off. Get to work.
[3849.46s -> 3852.46s]  Oh, it's one of these. The wolf grabs the box and starts sniffing it from every angle.
[3852.46s -> 3865.75s]  I could swear I've heard this tail moving under his coat.
[3865.75s -> 3868.75s]  Interesting. Fine. Me guess now you want to know what's inside.
[3868.75s -> 3871.75s]  The northwestern part of the old woods lies a place where you'll find a key to this box.
[3871.75s -> 3876.14s]  Northwestern part of the old woods.
[3876.14s -> 3879.14s]  Well, mate, I would be careful if I were you.
[3879.14s -> 3882.14s]  Trust me, you don't want to open it by yourself.
[3882.14s -> 3885.14s]  Bring me the key and don't try to be a wise guy.
[3885.14s -> 3892.54s]  You won't know what to do with it.
[3892.54s -> 3895.54s]  Looks like no one else will enlighten you. Listen.
[3895.54s -> 3898.54s]  The inhabitants of our lovely village hold many, many secrets.
[3898.54s -> 3901.54s]  Treasures they do not wish to share with anyone.
[3901.54s -> 3904.54s]  They think they're superior because they have human gobs.
[3904.54s -> 3907.54s]  They treat us like leopards.
[3907.54s -> 3910.54s]  Well, you know what? Fuck them. We're buddies, aren't we?
[3910.54s -> 3914.36s]  And them. Oh, they deserve to be punished, mate.
[3914.36s -> 3917.66s]  The wolf moves closer to me.
[3917.66s -> 3921.16s]  You hear that squealing? It's one of their secrets.
[3921.16s -> 3924.16s]  The wolf grins, listening to the distant sound with great relish.
[3924.16s -> 3927.72s]  Find that pig shed, mate. Make that squealing stop and the treasure will be yours.
[3927.72s -> 3944.14s]  I need that toolbox.
[3944.14s -> 3950.38s]  Stay here. Don't leave. Do not leave.
[3950.38s -> 3954.06s]  I've got, I've got to do something with you.
[3954.06s -> 3959.40s]  Hold on. He likes weapons.
[3959.40s -> 3968.90s]  Alright, what about a staff? Meat?
[3968.90s -> 3971.90s]  I shouldn't give her the gun, right? It's a handgun. It's worth a lot.
[3971.90s -> 3978.72s]  I have 37 matchsticks. Sell the shiny stone.
[3978.72s -> 3981.72s]  Oh, shit. I didn't even know I had one.
[3981.72s -> 3984.72s]  What's that doing in the consumable, in the alcohol category?
[3984.72s -> 3989.82s]  What is that going to put me on? Flare, maybe?
[3989.82s -> 3994.14s]  I'm not going to use these flares. You know that. I'm not going to use them.
[3994.14s -> 3998.02s]  I'm certain. What's with the big eyes? Scared?
[3998.02s -> 4001.02s]  Bad dream. The wolf winks at me, bearing his teeth slightly.
[4001.02s -> 4007.83s]  I need 200. So, I'll give you a flare.
[4007.83s -> 4011.14s]  60, 70, 80, 95.
[4011.14s -> 4014.14s]  And then I want $5 for this staff.
[4014.14s -> 4026.82s]  Give me that toolbox. Done deal.
[4026.82s -> 4035.29s]  Upgrade the workbench. Let's go. Shovel.
[4035.29s -> 4038.53s]  New melee weapon. I can get rid of this stupid board with nails in it.
[4039.53s -> 4046.53s]  Finally. There it is.
[4046.53s -> 4052.44s]  Thank God. Upgrade item two.
[4052.44s -> 4056.06s]  What can I do with this? Light materials.
[4056.06s -> 4059.30s]  Attacks use less stamina. Inflict more damage.
[4059.30s -> 4063.06s]  Increased durability. I like that.
[4063.06s -> 4066.06s]  And sturdy base greatly increased weapon durability.
[4066.06s -> 4069.06s]  I need another spade head.
[4069.06s -> 4072.06s]  I would say probably this one.
[4072.06s -> 4077.47s]  Weapon durability. Sharpened shovel.
[4077.47s -> 4080.90s]  What was I going to do?
[4080.90s -> 4086.58s]  I don't remember. This is an emergency weapon.
[4086.58s -> 4091.16s]  Repair item. No, don't need that anymore.
[4091.16s -> 4094.59s]  Torch. What are these bottles for?
[4094.59s -> 4097.59s]  I guess I could just throw them around and put glass everywhere.
[4097.59s -> 4100.59s]  That's not a bad idea.
[4100.59s -> 4104.60s]  I'm going to have a bunch of glass.
[4104.60s -> 4107.60s]  What the hell am I going to use this shit for anyways?
[4107.60s -> 4111.86s]  I need those boards. I need nails.
[4111.86s -> 4115.34s]  Where are my nails? There we go.
[4115.34s -> 4128.95s]  I'm going to go turn this wood into more boards.
[4128.95s -> 4131.95s]  14. How many do I need? What does it take to barricade a window?
[4131.95s -> 4135.51s]  Three. Alright, let's check this out.
[4135.51s -> 4138.51s]  I can make a door here, but let's get the windows first.
[4138.51s -> 4142.07s]  Seven. I can only do this three times.
[4142.07s -> 4145.07s]  Does he have nails? Does the wolf have nails?
[4145.07s -> 4156.25s]  I didn't even check. He does.
[4156.25s -> 4159.25s]  God damn it. I need all of these.
[4159.25s -> 4178.10s]  And we're going to red lobster.
[4178.10s -> 4181.60s]  Red lobster? No.
[4181.60s -> 4192.06s]  Ugh. Alright, let's board these.
[4192.06s -> 4195.68s]  No. What if I just don't give a shit and just board this up?
[4195.68s -> 4199.37s]  Like a barricade? No, that's a bad idea.
[4199.37s -> 4202.61s]  I have to make it secure.
[4202.61s -> 4205.85s]  This is the entryway. Let's board up this.
[4205.85s -> 4215.47s]  I'm going to have to do them all.
[4215.47s -> 4219.74s]  I actually don't mind sitting in this corner. Oh no.
[4219.74s -> 4225.98s]  I didn't see that. This room is not good.
[4225.98s -> 4246.06s]  Lobsters aren't even real.
[4246.06s -> 4257.23s]  This is alright. So they can only come in through here.
[4257.23s -> 4263.61s]  I actually don't like lobster very much. I like crab.
[4263.61s -> 4266.61s]  I prefer crab to lobster.
[4266.61s -> 4273.24s]  There's a potato in here. Alright, so the only one that needs to be boarded is this one.
[4273.24s -> 4277.06s]  And then I have the door there.
[4277.06s -> 4280.06s]  So this needs, I need some more wood and a couple more nails.
[4280.06s -> 4283.06s]  I can buy that from any of these two people in the house.
[4283.06s -> 4286.62s]  Let's go on my stash.
[4286.62s -> 4297.90s]  Chicken head. I'm getting rid of these matchsticks.
[4297.90s -> 4303.26s]  I don't have anything else that's worth anything.
[4303.26s -> 4307.97s]  I just need a little bit more.
[4307.97s -> 4311.96s]  The batteries are worth a lot.
[4311.96s -> 4314.96s]  But I feel like I'm going to need them eventually for something. Light armor.
[4314.96s -> 4323.96s]  A potato? Oh no.
[4323.96s -> 4328.53s]  Okay. So that wouldn't work?
[4328.53s -> 4336.68s]  I'm just going to sell the potato.
[4336.68s -> 4343.87s]  Sell the potato, sell the meat.
[4343.87s -> 4349.46s]  And one battery.
[4349.46s -> 4353.28s]  That should last me, I think.
[4353.28s -> 4357.22s]  Who has the stuff I need?
[4357.22s -> 4360.72s]  I know you have wood, so I'm going to take, I'm just going to buy ten wood from you.
[4360.72s -> 4367.42s]  Wires too. Just one wire.
[4367.42s -> 4372.96s]  Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
[4372.96s -> 4379.02s]  He's compulsively buying things. I need to do this though.
[4379.02s -> 4382.32s]  Otherwise I'm just dead.
[4382.32s -> 4390.78s]  A potato. A battery.
[4390.78s -> 4394.59s]  If he's meat. And that's good, right?
[4394.59s -> 4398.28s]  Because then I need to buy, what am I buying from you?
[4398.28s -> 4404.72s]  What was I doing? Why did I do this? For nails, right?
[4404.72s -> 4408.47s]  Okay, nails. So then I don't have to give you the battery.
[4408.47s -> 4416.18s]  No, I can keep the potato. And the meat.
[4416.18s -> 4420.57s]  What's this, like, up-down thing I'm seeing?
[4420.57s -> 4426.11s]  Now that lets me barricade this.
[4426.11s -> 4430.06s]  I want to bring, store this.
[4430.06s -> 4433.06s]  Glass bottles, because I want to break them.
[4433.06s -> 4440.82s]  Let's make another lockpick.
[4440.82s -> 4443.82s]  I only have one bandage. I have a couple of these good ones though.
[4443.82s -> 4448.26s]  You know what? No. No, not worth it.
[4448.26s -> 4452.72s]  Put the leaves back. Put the potato back. Put the boards.
[4452.72s -> 4460.36s]  Let's do it.
[4460.36s -> 4464.56s]  He's the traitor. What? Okay.
[4464.56s -> 4471.38s]  This is an open window. This needs to be boarded.
[4471.38s -> 4476.21s]  Boarded. Boarded? All the windows are boarded.
[4476.21s -> 4479.21s]  Now, I'm thinking, board up this.
[4479.21s -> 4486.78s]  And just be in here.
[4486.78s -> 4491.37s]  I think that's a good idea.
[4491.37s -> 4494.37s]  I guess it's, why did I...
[4494.37s -> 4500.68s]  Why did I board these up?
[4500.68s -> 4511.52s]  Just in case. I don't know. What about the lights?
[4511.52s -> 4514.52s]  I could put a light on in the corner over here.
[4514.52s -> 4521.09s]  And then the other one can just hang out, like, up there.
[4521.09s -> 4530.60s]  And I'm going to board this up too, when it becomes night time.
[4530.60s -> 4535.23s]  And this, unfortunately. Can I drag this?
[4535.23s -> 4542.06s]  Oh, I can drag this though.
[4542.06s -> 4547.46s]  At least block up this thing.
[4547.46s -> 4550.46s]  You now have one of the best melee weapons in the game, the shovel.
[4550.46s -> 4554.08s]  Oh, I know. That's why I built it. It was worth it.
[4554.08s -> 4561.93s]  Let's spin this. Can I spin this around?
[4561.93s -> 4564.93s]  This ain't going to do anything, but at least it'll be annoying.
[4564.93s -> 4570.20s]  It'll at least be irritating.
[4570.20s -> 4573.20s]  For somebody, for a second.
[4573.20s -> 4588.39s]  Let's spin this around. In here.
[4588.39s -> 4591.94s]  And then, so now I just...
[4591.94s -> 4595.11s]  Yeah. Right?
[4595.11s -> 4598.11s]  And then, sprinkle it here. Right there.
[4598.11s -> 4603.38s]  Right there. Yeah. Yeah.
[4603.38s -> 4606.38s]  Alright. Good. Don't step in it.
[4606.38s -> 4609.38s]  I'm going to put some more here too.
[4609.38s -> 4614.80s]  Just in case somebody, you know, comes in here.
[4614.80s -> 4617.80s]  He's going to step on it.
[4617.80s -> 4620.80s]  I am not really going to come down in this room.
[4620.80s -> 4623.98s]  Unless I absolutely have to.
[4623.98s -> 4632.14s]  At least that's the theory.
[4632.14s -> 4637.50s]  So glass is not a trap. It just hurts. Right?
[4637.50s -> 4640.50s]  Okay. Board this up. Do I have enough to do it?
[4640.50s -> 4646.66s]  I do. Do it.
[4646.66s -> 4651.94s]  And anybody getting through that? Bear trap.
[4651.94s -> 4657.42s]  Put the sofa down there. No, put the sofa up here.
[4657.42s -> 4661.68s]  No, no, no, no, no. I have to get everything in here too.
[4661.68s -> 4675.34s]  Where's the light? I'm going to get the light right now.
[4675.34s -> 4678.34s]  Should I just get one? No. The ghosts turn off one.
[4678.34s -> 4681.34s]  Hurry. I've got... Time has stopped right now.
[4681.34s -> 4692.06s]  I've got plenty of time.
[4692.06s -> 4697.48s]  It's seriously faster if I just do it like this.
[4697.48s -> 4700.48s]  And the bathtub too. Just so people can stop saying the word bathtub.
[4700.48s -> 4721.11s]  This is so far.
[4721.11s -> 4724.11s]  Uh oh. Here comes the bubble bobble ghost. Here it comes.
[4724.11s -> 4729.38s]  Were you actually serious?
[4729.38s -> 4732.38s]  I'll get that new ground I'm dragging over.
[4732.38s -> 4767.22s]  Get this in here. Good.
[4767.22s -> 4775.52s]  Now let's get the other one. Ice hockey?
[4775.52s -> 4792.90s]  Well that would be more like curling.
[4792.90s -> 4806.11s]  Curling is lame. It's alright. It's cool.
[4806.11s -> 4809.11s]  It's curling the game with the brums.
[4809.11s -> 4812.11s]  The guys just go favorishly like brum brum brum brum brum brum brum.
[4812.11s -> 4823.40s]  Right? That's kind of cool.
[4823.40s -> 4826.40s]  Alright. We can almost be done with this.
[4826.40s -> 4829.40s]  Uh. Generator off either.
[4829.40s -> 4836.80s]  I should... Can I make these eventually?
[4836.80s -> 4842.66s]  Because it's annoying to have to drag them around the whole damn house.
[4842.66s -> 4868.48s]  This is almost as boring as this stream.
[4868.48s -> 4873.83s]  What's that person's name? Sorry. What's that?
[4873.83s -> 4876.83s]  I couldn't hear you over me enjoying the video game.
[4876.83s -> 4898.87s]  What's that? I couldn't hear it. What'd you say?
[4898.87s -> 4903.07s]  Is somebody up? What? Straight down.
[4903.07s -> 4909.69s]  Alright. I'm ready to lock this down.
[4909.69s -> 4917.28s]  Tell me his name.
[4917.28s -> 4920.28s]  So in theory, this is boarded.
[4920.28s -> 4923.78s]  Sofa goes up here at night. Traps go down.
[4923.78s -> 4926.78s]  Well I'll have enough time to do that. I have them in my inventory.
[4926.78s -> 4930.02s]  I might as well just do them now. At least a couple of them.
[4930.02s -> 4933.58s]  Where I know I'm going to put them.
[4933.58s -> 4937.90s]  So this is very obvious. This has to go in the corner.
[4937.90s -> 4948.76s]  I'm setting up my Animal Crossing house.
[4948.76s -> 4952.19s]  Okay? Let me do it.
[4952.19s -> 4957.46s]  Maybe right in the middle. I don't... I hate that.
[4957.46s -> 4960.83s]  But if they turn it off... No, there's light going through there.
[4960.83s -> 4964.65s]  What about over here? Just both corners?
[4964.65s -> 4969.10s]  Yeah, right in front of the door. That's fine.
[4969.10s -> 4972.10s]  Play Animal Crossing OST. I'm not going to put Animal Crossing OST.
[4972.10s -> 4975.10s]  Alright. Bear Trap. In front of this window.
[4975.10s -> 4981.27s]  Just don't step in it.
[4981.27s -> 4984.27s]  And then eventually I'm going to have one right there and one right there.
[4984.27s -> 4987.45s]  You can't see because I'm pointing at the screen.
[4987.45s -> 4990.45s]  One right there. When I come in for the night.
[4990.45s -> 5000.00s]  We want Animal Crossing. And the Animal Crossing OST is not going to make any sense.
[5000.00s -> 5003.00s]  In about three minutes.
[5003.00s -> 5006.18s]  So... I thought I stepped on a trap.
[5006.18s -> 5014.78s]  Same thing with this one right here.
[5014.78s -> 5017.78s]  Both... That is good. That's good. One more here.
[5017.78s -> 5021.53s]  And then I have two for the front door.
[5021.53s -> 5024.53s]  I am ready to survive. I will live another day.
[5024.53s -> 5028.47s]  Because now if they get through this one...
[5028.47s -> 5031.71s]  Oh, what's that? Whoopsie.
[5031.71s -> 5035.34s]  Where's the actual door? The actual door is right here.
[5035.34s -> 5040.56s]  So I want it to be like right here. Right there.
[5040.56s -> 5047.90s]  Alright. And then at the end of the day...
[5047.90s -> 5050.90s]  Two here. I ain't dying, guys.
[5050.90s -> 5053.90s]  I'm not going to lose this one. And I'm not going to move.
[5053.90s -> 5057.65s]  So let's get the couch in the right spot.
[5057.65s -> 5060.65s]  So I can just kind of push it over when it gets too late.
[5060.65s -> 5064.58s]  Good! I'm ready. Let's go. What was I going to do?
[5064.58s -> 5072.30s]  I don't know. It's open. I can do whatever I want.
[5072.30s -> 5080.26s]  What was the thing that he said? The northwest of somewhere?
[5080.26s -> 5083.26s]  Not here. Up here, probably.
[5083.26s -> 5086.75s]  It's a pig. Yeah, the pig shed.
[5086.75s -> 5092.15s]  Is the pig shed down here?
[5092.15s -> 5098.91s]  Like up this way? Pig shed.
[5098.91s -> 5101.91s]  He's like, go up in that pig shed. Go to the pig shed.
[5101.91s -> 5105.66s]  Chicken Lady is south of the Silent Forest.
[5105.66s -> 5108.66s]  Alright. So I'm going to bring a chicken head to the chicken lady, right?
[5109.66s -> 5113.80s]  Makes sense, doesn't it?
[5113.80s -> 5116.80s]  Oh, I didn't. You're right. I did not go to the wedding.
[5116.80s -> 5121.30s]  Too many things to do. Alright, this is fine.
[5121.30s -> 5125.50s]  Oh, I'm going to fill the gas up.
[5125.50s -> 5129.13s]  I thought I didn't want to go to the wedding. It's just I forgot to go.
[5129.13s -> 5132.13s]  Let's fill up the generator. I actually filled this up with the gas.
[5132.13s -> 5138.25s]  Might as well. This thing needs it.
[5138.25s -> 5145.39s]  That's alright. Put the rest in here.
[5145.39s -> 5155.34s]  Okay. Store the traps.
[5155.34s -> 5159.41s]  And I'm ready for the adventure to begin.
[5159.41s -> 5163.29s]  Wait. Bandage. Keep. Got that.
[5163.29s -> 5166.29s]  Put the knife in the second slot. Bear trap can go away for now.
[5166.29s -> 5169.29s]  Both bear traps can go away. Nice.
[5169.29s -> 5172.29s]  Alright. Looking good. Looking good.
[5172.29s -> 5176.62s]  Nails. So I got lockpick. Watch.
[5176.62s -> 5179.62s]  Bandage. New weapon. Shovel.
[5179.62s -> 5185.13s]  Bingo. I'm ready.
[5185.13s -> 5188.13s]  We are going to go left and then we're going to go to this person's house.
[5188.13s -> 5195.08s]  Chicken head. Don't forget the chicken head.
[5195.08s -> 5198.08s]  Where is it? Chicken head. We're going to the chicken lady's house.
[5198.08s -> 5204.07s]  Alright. Here we go. I'm going left and then down.
[5204.07s -> 5207.07s]  I got the shovel now. Let's see. What does it do?
[5207.07s -> 5210.07s]  Okay. It's like a stab. How long does this take?
[5210.07s -> 5214.21s]  Okay. It's a big swing. This game looks pretty cool.
[5214.21s -> 5218.02s]  The game is pretty cool. It is pretty cool.
[5218.02s -> 5221.02s]  But hold on. How do I do? Was it Q to do the thing?
[5221.02s -> 5224.58s]  Is it set? How do I do this?
[5224.58s -> 5228.14s]  I get it. Just wanted to know.
[5228.14s -> 5231.14s]  So let's go down here. Let's go to Piotrek's house.
[5231.14s -> 5234.14s]  Or as far as we can get.
[5234.14s -> 5243.02s]  Remember. We're collecting nails too.
[5243.02s -> 5246.19s]  Use the UAV. Use your UAV.
[5246.19s -> 5255.18s]  Chicken lady. Don't step on mushrooms.
[5255.18s -> 5258.18s]  I have a negative now.
[5258.18s -> 5263.78s]  Stepping on mushrooms means very bad things happen to me.
[5263.78s -> 5271.25s]  There's a moose here somewhere. I don't even want it.
[5271.25s -> 5275.77s]  I told you it was right here. I'm not going to fight it.
[5275.77s -> 5282.06s]  There's no reason to. Don't step on a mushroom.
[5282.06s -> 5285.06s]  There's so many poison mushrooms.
[5285.06s -> 5298.16s]  It's just a maze of poison mushrooms. I need to go down, not up.
[5298.16s -> 5304.33s]  I don't have a torch. I didn't bring a torch.
[5304.33s -> 5307.33s]  The one thing that I forgot to bring.
[5307.33s -> 5311.91s]  Damn it. I was so ready for this too.
[5311.91s -> 5321.36s]  Where are we at? Alright. We're at Piotrek's house.
[5321.36s -> 5331.37s]  Got some barricades.
[5332.37s -> 5359.19s]  Somebody in there?
[5359.19s -> 5363.39s]  I don't want to if I don't have to.
[5363.39s -> 5376.86s]  I'm going in. Junk pile.
[5376.86s -> 5379.86s]  A pile of junk sloppily welded together.
[5379.86s -> 5397.59s]  This is somebody's base.
[5397.59s -> 5400.59s]  Tractor ain't going to stop me from coming in.
[5400.59s -> 5405.50s]  There's a heavy smell of gasoline in the air.
[5405.50s -> 5408.50s]  This is once a tractor. Now it's a hollow rusty body.
[5408.50s -> 5416.84s]  All of its useful mechanical parts have been scavenged.
[5416.84s -> 5427.94s]  Alcohol, match, gasoline.
[5427.94s -> 5431.82s]  Nobody in here. I need fire.
[5431.82s -> 5438.38s]  I can't get through here without fire and I didn't bring...
[5438.38s -> 5441.62s]  What about the match stick? Can I throw matches on it?
[5441.62s -> 5448.50s]  Can I light a match? Oh yeah I can.
[5448.50s -> 5465.16s]  I'm not strong enough.
[5465.16s -> 5470.88s]  Alcohol and match.
[5470.88s -> 5481.42s]  Throw alcohol and then throw match.
[5481.42s -> 5484.42s]  There's gas in here and I'm like
[5484.42s -> 5487.42s]  I'm just going to throw matches.
[5487.42s -> 5492.45s]  I didn't even realize that. Yeah you're right.
[5492.45s -> 5503.88s]  That would be really dumb.
[5503.88s -> 5508.78s]  Well I'm going to need to throw a Molotov in here.
[5508.78s -> 5517.77s]  Remember this exists. Put gasoline on the gunk.
[5517.77s -> 5556.46s]  I have an idea. Does this work?
[5556.46s -> 5567.43s]  I thought there was gas in the air.
[5567.43s -> 5588.58s]  Yeah.
[5588.58s -> 5591.75s]  I didn't have to do that much.
[5591.75s -> 5594.75s]  I figured if there was a big fire the whole building would explode.
[5594.75s -> 5597.75s]  That's why I tried to go out and do like that GTA mission.
[5597.75s -> 5602.02s]  I've got to be ready for this.
[5602.02s -> 5609.08s]  Something's probably in here. No it's just a chest.
[5609.08s -> 5617.87s]  And some mushrooms.
[5617.87s -> 5623.66s]  It's in the crate. Something worth it.
[5623.66s -> 5628.43s]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah that's worth it.
[5628.43s -> 5633.14s]  And a note. And I cannot decipher any of this shit.
[5633.14s -> 5636.51s]  So this is a wheel.
[5636.51s -> 5640.89s]  A tire. A toaster.
[5640.89s -> 5645.60s]  A rocket ship.
[5645.60s -> 5648.60s]  Well they were breathing in gasoline this whole time they were drawing this.
[5648.60s -> 5655.49s]  So they take this whole thing with a grain of salt.
[5655.49s -> 5664.73s]  Alright well I got the toolbox. That's good. Let's continue.
[5664.73s -> 5672.26s]  Nothing else in here. Well I'm like in this little compound area.
[5672.26s -> 5675.26s]  This place looks like a scrap metal warehouse.
[5675.26s -> 5680.86s]  The walls are covered with fungus and spider webs. It's very stuffy in here.
[5680.86s -> 5684.42s]  I'm going to get reed. I know it.
[5684.42s -> 5687.92s]  They put my hands up here.
[5687.92s -> 5690.92s]  I don't know what kind of defense mechanism that's supposed to be.
[5690.92s -> 5704.58s]  But I do it when I get scared every time.
[5704.58s -> 5715.43s]  I smell a rosin. What the hell is a rosin?
[5715.43s -> 5718.43s]  Batteries and tape. And then a postcard with a portrait of a man.
[5718.43s -> 5721.43s]  Someone has pinned a caption on it.
[5721.43s -> 5728.22s]  1961 the sky is dark and the earth is blue.
[5728.22s -> 5731.22s]  Nebo. Just cream.
[5731.22s -> 5734.22s]  Oh that's a different language.
[5734.22s -> 5739.19s]  There's also stuff down here. Metal door.
[5739.19s -> 5743.78s]  Prepare.
[5743.78s -> 5749.51s]  There's a person right here.
[5749.51s -> 5752.51s]  Oh there's a person. I didn't hear you come in.
[5752.51s -> 5755.51s]  The boy's eyes are wandering around the room.
[5755.51s -> 5761.18s]  Wait is this the courier?
[5775.47s -> 5779.90s]  Should I show him all the stuff?
[5816.11s -> 5819.11s]  One from the spring that fell off recently.
[5819.11s -> 5822.48s]  When I was entering the cockpit I hit my head and well it fell off.
[5822.48s -> 5825.48s]  I thought I was flying but it was just that lights went off.
[5825.48s -> 5830.43s]  Oh this is your blueprint.
[5830.43s -> 5833.43s]  These are the blueprints for my space rocket. Almost ready.
[5833.43s -> 5836.43s]  I broke down a whole tractor to build it.
[5836.43s -> 5839.43s]  But I'm missing several parts. Several very important parts.
[5839.43s -> 5842.43s]  For example a shiny little mirror in this rectangular box with wires.
[5842.43s -> 5845.98s]  And the boy suddenly becomes lost in thought.
[5845.98s -> 5849.73s]  If only I had more tractors. It would definitely go to space.
[5849.73s -> 5854.76s]  What can you tell me about the road?
[5854.76s -> 5858.83s]  You won't be able to make it home via this road. You should build a rocket instead.
[5858.83s -> 5865.40s]  What do you have? Oh containers of gasoline of course.
[5865.40s -> 5874.14s]  I just inhale it all day.
[5874.14s -> 5877.14s]  I like electronic and mechanical thingies. Foods. All sorts of stuff.
[5877.14s -> 5880.14s]  So you like food. Mechanical things. Batteries even.
[5880.14s -> 5885.86s]  One would say you like batteries.
[5885.86s -> 5894.42s]  Oh you got nails.
[5894.42s -> 5901.99s]  Here. You like watches. I'll give you a battery.
[5901.99s -> 5906.83s]  What's this? Cable.
[5906.83s -> 5909.83s]  Does he have any in particular items that I... what did I just buy?
[5909.83s -> 5915.25s]  Okay. You just stole his nails. No I didn't.
[5915.25s -> 5920.47s]  I had 50 reputation dollars.
[5920.47s -> 5923.65s]  Flashlight. Military flashlight.
[5923.65s -> 5928.17s]  And a regular flashlight is too much money.
[5928.17s -> 5931.17s]  I'm going to have to come back here with other stuff for you.
[5931.17s -> 5937.03s]  You like electronic and mechanical thingies.
[5937.03s -> 5940.72s]  Okay. Good to know.
[5940.72s -> 5943.72s]  What about gossip?
[5957.72s -> 5962.10s]  Suddenly it becomes sad.
[5970.49s -> 5973.49s]  Well I know you exist now.
[5973.49s -> 5976.49s]  What's in your... is it a bathroom?
[5976.49s -> 5979.49s]  You got something over here.
[5979.49s -> 5982.79s]  Hold on. It's getting kind of late.
[5982.79s -> 5985.79s]  I should probably think about getting at it.
[5985.79s -> 5988.79s]  I could open it with a lockpick.
[5988.79s -> 6000.78s]  Okay.
[6000.78s -> 6006.58s]  Okay.
[6006.58s -> 6014.69s]  Okay.
[6014.69s -> 6018.50s]  I should probably think about getting at it.
[6018.50s -> 6026.91s]  I could open it with a lockpick. Is he going to be mad about this?
[6026.91s -> 6040.95s]  What do you got in here? And two Molotov cocktails.
[6040.95s -> 6046.37s]  Generator. Okay.
[6046.37s -> 6049.37s]  How do I look for inventory space? I'm going to have to think about heading back.
[6049.37s -> 6053.57s]  I'll give it one more look.
[6053.57s -> 6062.36s]  And then it's time to go back.
[6062.36s -> 6066.03s]  I'm going to go down. Where's this...
[6066.03s -> 6071.38s]  Witch's hut. Whatever it was.
[6071.38s -> 6077.30s]  Get out of here.
[6077.30s -> 6083.48s]  Don't even... I just need one shot.
[6083.48s -> 6087.65s]  Or two.
[6087.65s -> 6090.65s]  This reach is amazing. I'm so glad I have this.
[6090.65s -> 6095.49s]  And it's pretty durable too.
[6095.49s -> 6101.72s]  Alright. Let's go down.
[6101.72s -> 6121.78s]  At fifteen or so I've got to turn around.
[6121.78s -> 6126.04s]  What the hell is that? Oh shit. There's two.
[6126.04s -> 6133.79s]  Oh no. I've got to... okay.
[6133.79s -> 6137.10s]  Come here. You don't even know.
[6146.62s -> 6150.55s]  What do you got? Wires.
[6150.55s -> 6154.30s]  Alcohol. Is somebody still banging?
[6154.30s -> 6161.62s]  Who's banging? Who's banging right now?
[6161.62s -> 6164.62s]  Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.
[6164.62s -> 6167.62s]  Wait, wait, wait. I've got to...
[6167.62s -> 6173.02s]  Get rid of the matches.
[6173.02s -> 6176.02s]  Get rid of the meat.
[6176.02s -> 6179.02s]  Get rid of the stones.
[6179.02s -> 6195.11s]  Okay. And battery.
[6195.11s -> 6212.18s]  Oh, it's this guy. He's hitting his head against a tree.
[6212.18s -> 6219.38s]  Alright. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. Time to go.
[6219.38s -> 6223.78s]  Hey. Once a day. Once a day I can do this thing.
[6223.78s -> 6226.78s]  That is very useful right now. Once a day.
[6226.78s -> 6273.78s]  Hey! Whoa!
[6273.78s -> 6276.95s]  Shit. I should have went... What is that? I should have went at fifteen.
[6276.95s -> 6285.10s]  Can I do it again? Alright. We're good.
[6285.10s -> 6291.34s]  I'm going. I'm going. I got a lot of good stuff.
[6291.34s -> 6295.65s]  Two.
[6295.65s -> 6300.10s]  Fine. It's fine. Just go.
[6300.10s -> 6306.78s]  He's pretty fast though. He's fast. He's kind of fast.
[6306.78s -> 6311.75s]  Where the fuck am I? Okay. I'm here.
[6311.75s -> 6316.98s]  Where am I? This is not my house. Where's my house?
[6316.98s -> 6320.34s]  Poison. Your sight is wrong. Where's my house?
[6320.34s -> 6336.18s]  Oh please. Just...
[6336.18s -> 6339.18s]  Go. I have... Okay. I've got to remember what I was going to do.
[6339.18s -> 6346.69s]  This ain't my house. There it is.
[6346.69s -> 6349.69s]  This wood right below my house? I didn't even know that.
[6349.69s -> 6354.59s]  Fix this well too. No. I can't. Not yet.
[6354.59s -> 6357.59s]  Oh my god.
[6357.59s -> 6360.90s]  These were just down here the whole time? Forget it.
[6360.90s -> 6371.69s]  Do it tomorrow. I have no time for this shit.
[6371.69s -> 6374.69s]  One. Two. Three. Almost eight hundred. Good. Good.
[6374.69s -> 6377.99s]  Store this stuff. Bring out the traps.
[6377.99s -> 6381.74s]  Store the fabric. The toolbox.
[6381.74s -> 6384.98s]  The chicken head.
[6384.98s -> 6388.42s]  Let's make another bandage.
[6388.42s -> 6392.98s]  Make a torch. Yeah. Yeah.
[6392.98s -> 6395.98s]  Make a couple torches because I'm going to need them.
[6395.98s -> 6399.48s]  I think. Drugs. Molotov cocktail.
[6399.48s -> 6402.48s]  Bullets. Wire. Put just all this stuff. I can figure it out later.
[6402.48s -> 6405.48s]  The nails. The machine gun.
[6405.48s -> 6408.48s]  The other...
[6408.48s -> 6413.82s]  I need more inventory space.
[6413.82s -> 6417.31s]  I can have two clips. Gasoline.
[6417.31s -> 6420.81s]  Okay. Now what's this? Hotbar upgrade.
[6420.81s -> 6425.76s]  I can't do this though.
[6425.76s -> 6428.76s]  I can't craft more items of this type so I have to do a hotbar upgrade.
[6428.76s -> 6441.18s]  Wait. What about the shovel?
[6441.18s -> 6444.18s]  I'm running out of time. Okay.
[6444.18s -> 6448.26s]  Just go. Go. Go. Go. I need to repair this. Oh no. What?
[6448.26s -> 6451.26s]  What does it take? What is that?
[6451.26s -> 6454.26s]  What is that? Super scrap. Scrap?
[6454.26s -> 6458.46s]  I don't have that. Okay. I'm in trouble.
[6458.46s -> 6462.02s]  Give me the board. I don't want this to break.
[6462.02s -> 6465.02s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[6465.02s -> 6482.56s]  Out. Get out. I didn't take any traps.
[6482.56s -> 6519.14s]  Where are the traps?
[6519.14s -> 6530.26s]  I just put my face in it. I shouldn't have done that.
[6530.26s -> 6533.26s]  That was a mistake. I can't move this over. Yeah, I can.
[6533.26s -> 6557.47s]  There are traps fucking everywhere.
[6557.47s -> 6560.90s]  Got it. Okay. We're good. Let's go.
[6560.90s -> 6575.73s]  Electricity. Once a day.
[6575.73s -> 6588.42s]  I'm surrounded. There's no gas in the generator? Yeah, there is.
[6588.42s -> 6599.66s]  There's plenty. You can't step into one of those if you don't move.
[6599.66s -> 6603.61s]  I mean, the theory is to just kind of stand away from...
[6603.61s -> 6608.45s]  How come they're not coming over here?
[6608.45s -> 6611.45s]  I should have barricaded the door. That's right. You're right.
[6611.45s -> 6615.26s]  I was going to do that. Remember I said I was going to do that? It's okay.
[6615.26s -> 6618.26s]  I have to pee really bad too. I'm trying to hold it in as long as I can.
[6618.26s -> 6628.21s]  No sign of anybody yet.
[6628.21s -> 6632.09s]  Can I do it from right here? I can.
[6632.09s -> 6636.29s]  No, I'm not doing it. I think that would be a waste.
[6636.29s -> 6640.42s]  Because I'm already almost at a good enough time, I think.
[6640.42s -> 6643.66s]  Let's do it now. I don't need to do it now.
[6643.66s -> 6651.38s]  I got trapped right here.
[6651.38s -> 6657.70s]  They're going to push the sofa out of the way, get stuck, and I'm going to kill them in one hit.
[6657.70s -> 6660.70s]  Plus, I'm going to be banging on the wall?
[6660.70s -> 6670.90s]  That's just asking somebody to come over here.
[6670.90s -> 6689.67s]  No, it's good the way it is. There's a gun.
[6690.67s -> 6703.11s]  There's no way. It hit the wood.
[6703.11s -> 6709.68s]  Okay, get ready.
[6709.68s -> 6712.86s]  He's over there.
[6712.86s -> 6737.86s]  He's in the other part of the house.
[6737.86s -> 6743.02s]  Okay, there he is. There he is.
[6743.02s -> 6746.02s]  He's coming over. How much health does he have?
[6746.02s -> 6750.15s]  He's almost broken. He's almost broken. He's in. He got in. He's going to get in.
[6750.15s -> 6753.15s]  Got you. He's dead. Come to me.
[6753.15s -> 6756.15s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't come to you. I need to...
[6756.15s -> 6767.63s]  Oh, no, it's open. Go to them.
[6767.63s -> 6772.41s]  No, rearm the trap. I don't have any more.
[6772.41s -> 6779.34s]  I don't have any more. I got to hit somebody to have a...
[6779.34s -> 6848.82s]  Okay, I'm fine. I'm good.
[6848.82s -> 6862.22s]  Use the moth. What's that? What's the red?
[6862.22s -> 6873.32s]  Oh, right. Day 13. This is the unlucky one.
[6873.32s -> 6881.30s]  All right, now I've got some time. We live another day.
[6881.30s -> 6890.34s]  This strategy worked out pretty well, but I'm going to board the door next time.
[6890.34s -> 6893.70s]  That can stay. I need to reboard this. What do I need?
[6893.70s -> 6896.70s]  I need wood, and it's all down there. All right.
[6896.70s -> 6899.70s]  I'm going to pee. I have to go to the bathroom now.
[6899.70s -> 6902.70s]  I'll be back in like two minutes. Maybe more.
[6902.70s -> 7061.14s]  You're back. I'm back.
[7066.03s -> 7070.87s]  If Jerma reads this, I'll eat my sock.
[7070.87s -> 7075.20s]  I wouldn't do that. How about this?
[7075.20s -> 7079.21s]  Go get yourself water.
[7079.21s -> 7083.15s]  At least eight ounces.
[7083.15s -> 7095.21s]  How does that sound?
[7096.21s -> 7099.77s]  What did you say? This wood logs here, too.
[7099.77s -> 7103.65s]  Now, let's put this back in.
[7103.65s -> 7110.34s]  Make sure I'm in the right place, which I should be.
[7110.34s -> 7113.34s]  I've got to get a haircut, too, eventually.
[7113.34s -> 7118.23s]  All right. This was a success.
[7118.23s -> 7122.56s]  So much, in fact, that I'm going to do it again.
[7122.56s -> 7129.43s]  I've got scrap metal.
[7131.43s -> 7136.70s]  First things first.
[7136.70s -> 7139.70s]  This was untouched, so that's good.
[7139.70s -> 7143.39s]  I'm going to put some more gas in here.
[7143.39s -> 7158.44s]  Hey, what? What's this shit?
[7158.44s -> 7162.38s]  Why is this here?
[7168.82s -> 7173.40s]  Why is there corruption all over the place?
[7178.43s -> 7185.56s]  All right, you're good. Don't hit the trader.
[7185.56s -> 7193.60s]  I'm not going to hit the trader.
[7193.60s -> 7198.06s]  Scrap metal weapon part.
[7198.06s -> 7201.06s]  I've got plenty of time, so let me go to the workbench.
[7201.06s -> 7204.94s]  Let's see what this takes now.
[7204.94s -> 7207.94s]  I need to upgrade the workbench. I need a gas canister.
[7207.94s -> 7212.58s]  I can make a hot bar upgrade, which is probably for the best.
[7212.58s -> 7216.21s]  So I'm going to do it. What's it going to give me?
[7216.21s -> 7219.21s]  Another hot bar. That's good. It's just another slot.
[7219.21s -> 7226.61s]  I'm going to repair the shovel.
[7226.61s -> 7231.83s]  And then I'm going to look at this again.
[7231.83s -> 7234.83s]  Durability. I need eight scrap and I need a silencer tube.
[7234.83s -> 7238.71s]  Scrap and a silencer. I want increased durability.
[7238.71s -> 7247.52s]  Silencer tube. You got one of those?
[7247.52s -> 7250.82s]  You do. I will take that. How much scrap do you have?
[7250.82s -> 7254.96s]  Three. I'll take it all.
[7254.96s -> 7264.52s]  Okay. How many lockpicks do I have? Two. That's fine.
[7264.52s -> 7271.28s]  Okay. What do I need? Eight?
[7271.28s -> 7282.52s]  Plenty of these. All right. I need to...
[7282.52s -> 7285.52s]  The thing about games like this is it's so hard
[7285.52s -> 7288.52s]  to just point at the one thing that you want to do
[7288.52s -> 7292.40s]  and do it. You just get... What about that?
[7292.40s -> 7295.40s]  And what about this? What about this? And what about that one?
[7295.40s -> 7299.41s]  Wait, I've got to get nails. Okay, I've got to get nails.
[7299.41s -> 7304.25s]  But no way. I've got to get this tire over there. I have to get the tire to make the thing.
[7304.25s -> 7307.25s]  But that makes it fun. I really like it. Make the camera bigger.
[7307.25s -> 7310.25s]  Is this a one-guy scenario where I'm going to one-guy this?
[7310.25s -> 7319.50s]  No, that's a good spot. In fact, it's too bright.
[7319.50s -> 7336.60s]  There you go. There. That's better.
[7336.60s -> 7347.97s]  But no, I really like that about the game.
[7347.97s -> 7351.64s]  I like it so...
[7351.64s -> 7354.64s]  There's so many random things to make
[7354.64s -> 7357.64s]  and look at and craft, and you only have a certain amount of slots.
[7357.64s -> 7360.64s]  It's just managing your
[7360.64s -> 7363.64s]  self. But look at all this stuff.
[7363.64s -> 7367.07s]  I don't even have the stuff even... Okay, I can make a pistol.
[7367.07s -> 7371.72s]  But it's one shot. Hold on. I need the weapon part.
[7371.72s -> 7375.34s]  This is what I was talking about.
[7375.34s -> 7383.30s]  Now I'm... Okay, I want the...
[7383.30s -> 7408.85s]  Now I... All right.
[7408.85s -> 7420.06s]  Okay. One at a time.
[7420.06s -> 7423.06s]  I need to go back and set the traps back up
[7423.06s -> 7426.74s]  over here. So I have...
[7426.74s -> 7429.74s]  How many traps do I have? I'm going to bring the gasoline over and I'm going to fill
[7429.74s -> 7432.74s]  the gas tank again. The shovel is fixed.
[7432.74s -> 7435.74s]  I think I want another torch because this one's almost gone.
[7435.74s -> 7438.74s]  Put the glass back here. Oh, that's right.
[7438.74s -> 7441.74s]  I was going to make an upgrade for the shovel.
[7441.74s -> 7445.69s]  Which is... I need four more scrap.
[7445.69s -> 7448.86s]  We're going to go get scrap. Oh, this game's fucking awesome.
[7448.86s -> 7455.74s]  Okay. I'm going to sell this battery.
[7455.74s -> 7462.94s]  Because I don't want it. All these nails.
[7462.94s -> 7465.94s]  I'm going to need these though.
[7465.94s -> 7468.94s]  And some boards. Do I have any more? I have two.
[7468.94s -> 7479.34s]  Take the potato and just eat it. Box.
[7479.34s -> 7485.65s]  Medium caliber bullet.
[7485.65s -> 7497.78s]  Okay, I'm going to get another wire. Yes.
[7497.78s -> 7510.78s]  I think...
[7510.78s -> 7516.65s]  No, no, no. Boards is what I need from you.
[7516.65s -> 7519.65s]  No, I don't. Because there's wood down.
[7519.65s -> 7522.65s]  All right. Go get wood
[7522.65s -> 7525.65s]  from the thing down below you. That's the task I'm doing right now.
[7525.65s -> 7543.67s]  Stay frozen. Stay frozen.
[7543.67s -> 7548.06s]  Stay frozen. Stay frozen. Stay frozen. Stay frozen. Stay frozen.
[7548.06s -> 7551.24s]  It's frozen. Good. Okay. Got the wood. Craft it.
[7551.24s -> 7559.09s]  All right. I now have plenty of these.
[7559.09s -> 7566.84s]  Board this up again. Bang.
[7566.84s -> 7569.84s]  German's not going to answer us about his tears.
[7569.84s -> 7574.30s]  So that's done. Now I'm not going to freak out over that.
[7574.30s -> 7578.75s]  Now I need to make a bear trap.
[7578.75s -> 7584.81s]  I can actually do that later when I come back with more scrap.
[7584.81s -> 7587.81s]  This is a scrap run.
[7587.81s -> 7592.39s]  Try to find chicken lady.
[7592.39s -> 7595.39s]  Which is down here.
[7595.39s -> 7598.39s]  I'm going to say it's right here. Find chicken lady and get scrap.
[7598.39s -> 7601.39s]  Is this for today? That's what we're doing today.
[7601.39s -> 7605.53s]  And re-arrange this ship.
[7605.53s -> 7609.28s]  How does that meet in here?
[7609.28s -> 7614.25s]  Weapons go up. I'll do this later.
[7614.25s -> 7617.49s]  So many random things that I have now.
[7617.49s -> 7620.49s]  Aye, aye, aye.
[7620.49s -> 7636.96s]  Okay. Scrap metal.
[7636.96s -> 7641.99s]  I'm starting to lose my mind because I'm just going over a thousand times.
[7641.99s -> 7644.99s]  All right. Scrap metal. Let's put everything in. Keep the potato.
[7644.99s -> 7647.99s]  I'll keep this torch because I'll burn these both out.
[7647.99s -> 7650.99s]  That's fine. Gasoline can stay over here.
[7650.99s -> 7653.99s]  I got plenty. Let's go. I'm ready.
[7653.99s -> 7659.90s]  I'm ready for this. Let's go get scrap.
[7659.90s -> 7663.46s]  I have to be back here at 15 hours. Chicken head.
[7663.46s -> 7675.76s]  Good reminder. Thank you.
[7675.76s -> 7681.74s]  Thank you. What happened? Oh, my house is poisoned.
[7681.74s -> 7688.53s]  Scrap.
[7688.53s -> 7717.58s]  I said I was trying to get scrap.
[7717.58s -> 7720.58s]  Use your Molotov. I'm just going to get over there.
[7720.58s -> 7729.37s]  I'm going to make another torch anyways.
[7729.37s -> 7732.37s]  Okay. Good. Somebody stepped in that last night apparently.
[7732.37s -> 7737.66s]  All right. I got a few scrap.
[7737.66s -> 7742.82s]  Good. Make another torch. Ignored.
[7742.82s -> 7750.07s]  Who am I ignoring?
[7750.07s -> 7753.63s]  Who am I ignoring? Us.
[7757.69s -> 7764.05s]  Oh, what?
[7764.05s -> 7768.89s]  All right. It's time. Scrap run.
[7768.89s -> 7773.86s]  Chicken house. No, don't say the word chicken.
[7773.86s -> 7777.74s]  Because I can't eat like fried chicken.
[7777.74s -> 7780.74s]  And I want like a fried chicken sandwich now. And it's over.
[7780.74s -> 7788.20s]  And it's not. I can't do it. I can't have that.
[7788.20s -> 7791.20s]  I'm going to have to eat like turkey patties. But those are fine.
[7791.20s -> 7802.36s]  All right. Let's go down. Probably animal.
[7802.36s -> 7813.33s]  All right. Where is chicken lady?
[7813.33s -> 7818.36s]  Big open field here. Wood.
[7818.36s -> 7821.36s]  I'll take it. Road to the village?
[7821.36s -> 7832.33s]  I can't get into any of this.
[7832.33s -> 7850.14s]  Road to the village. Gutted pig.
[7850.14s -> 7857.40s]  Is it poison? Where the hell am I going?
[7857.40s -> 7879.44s]  Am I going to a new map? I can't do that now.
[7879.44s -> 7882.44s]  Shrine. A shiny stone has been pressed into the mud covered head.
[7882.44s -> 7885.62s]  Take the stone. This is Indiana Jones type shit.
[7885.62s -> 7888.62s]  No. I'm not taking it.
[7888.62s -> 7894.42s]  Not yet. I take the stone. All of a sudden a boulder is going to land on me.
[7894.42s -> 7897.42s]  I'm going to alert the horde.
[7897.42s -> 7906.10s]  What's this? A wagon?
[7906.10s -> 7910.36s]  A meat wagon. A dock.
[7910.36s -> 7921.01s]  There's something in the water. A phone.
[7921.01s -> 7929.69s]  Our woods are so beautiful this time of year.
[7929.69s -> 7945.66s]  I can't talk. Where's my meat?
[7945.66s -> 7950.76s]  I should get two kilos of meat for this month.
[7950.76s -> 7956.35s]  Antec won't save you this time.
[7956.35s -> 7966.50s]  You hear me? Give me the fucking meat.
[7966.50s -> 7971.15s]  If he ever tries to come back, fucking quack doctor.
[7971.15s -> 7978.10s]  Bug. Bag. Doctor bag.
[7978.10s -> 7992.02s]  Who are you? I don't know. Get away from me.
[7992.02s -> 7995.58s]  Alright, alright, alright. I'm fine, I'm fine.
[7995.58s -> 7998.58s]  I don't want to piss off any NPCs. Generators running. Two generators.
[7998.58s -> 8004.63s]  Barricaded windows.
[8004.63s -> 8009.15s]  Okay, let me look back around.
[8009.15s -> 8020.25s]  I'm going to go in this room. Destroyed well.
[8020.25s -> 8026.43s]  I can go in this. Pigs in here?
[8026.43s -> 8033.05s]  How much gas you got in these? It's a lot.
[8033.05s -> 8043.97s]  Alright, so this is nothing I can do here.
[8043.97s -> 8049.00s]  What now? Get the fuck away from my home.
[8049.00s -> 8055.30s]  There is no more meat.
[8055.30s -> 8064.30s]  The sow is starving.
[8064.30s -> 8076.11s]  Get or I'll let Antec loose. What is Antec?
[8076.11s -> 8080.31s]  Oh my goodness.
[8080.31s -> 8098.83s]  Alright, I'm out. Chest. Map.
[8098.83s -> 8103.34s]  What a joyous day.
[8103.34s -> 8108.30s]  We shall meet again today.
[8108.30s -> 8111.30s]  I hope she'll enjoy what I've prepared for her.
[8111.30s -> 8114.30s]  She hasn't had an appetite lately, but it's okay.
[8114.30s -> 8117.30s]  We have our ways around that, don't we?
[8117.30s -> 8120.30s]  She must eat rich meals.
[8120.30s -> 8123.30s]  I've dug out something delicious for her today.
[8123.30s -> 8126.30s]  My queen. Only I can be close to her. No one else. No one.
[8126.30s -> 8129.30s]  No one else will get close to you anymore.
[8129.30s -> 8132.54s]  Everything.
[8132.54s -> 8138.47s]  I can get you today.
[8138.47s -> 8141.65s]  If you're monarchy, if you're hungry,
[8141.65s -> 8144.65s]  I shall now, I shall show you something
[8144.65s -> 8147.65s]  I've found the way.
[8147.65s -> 8153.26s]  Sixteen.
[8153.26s -> 8168.27s]  Sixteen. That's probably part one of the code in there.
[8168.27s -> 8171.58s]  Time has stood still in here, by the way.
[8171.58s -> 8178.27s]  Which is interesting.
[8178.27s -> 8181.27s]  There's a guy in there that doesn't want me in there.
[8181.27s -> 8184.90s]  People want meat, right?
[8184.90s -> 8187.90s]  I'm assuming Antec is the pig.
[8187.90s -> 8199.52s]  Like the prize pig.
[8199.52s -> 8205.58s]  If I find a long sturdy rope or chain, I should be able to descend it.
[8205.58s -> 8208.82s]  What? I can descend into the well?
[8208.82s -> 8213.02s]  He's been hiding in his cottage for the last couple of days.
[8213.02s -> 8220.34s]  He'll end up like the others.
[8220.34s -> 8226.07s]  I'm telling you. He'll run off into the woods and disappear.
[8226.07s -> 8229.07s]  So is this supposed to be my village that I've disappeared into the woods?
[8229.07s -> 8232.31s]  These people aren't all messed up yet.
[8232.31s -> 8235.31s]  The villagers turned their heads away from me.
[8235.31s -> 8238.31s]  I don't think I'm welcome here.
[8238.31s -> 8253.58s]  Well, I have a shovel, so that don't matter.
[8253.58s -> 8262.20s]  I need to get in this room, okay?
[8262.20s -> 8265.20s]  Not a very good puzzle. I hate to say. Sorry to tell you.
[8265.20s -> 8268.44s]  All it took was me to put weight into it.
[8268.44s -> 8290.42s]  Shelf? Nothing?
[8290.42s -> 8293.42s]  What the hell is going on?
[8293.42s -> 8313.87s]  Why is it doing this?
[8313.87s -> 8344.04s]  You gotta pick up the shit before you get in trouble.
[8344.04s -> 8352.66s]  I can hear you. Hear you.
[8352.66s -> 8391.14s]  Just want to look under your bed and see if you have any coins.
[8391.14s -> 8399.82s]  Did I kill this thing?
[8399.82s -> 8405.53s]  So, how is he?
[8405.53s -> 8417.01s]  He's gonna be fine. Just give him Tylenol.
[8417.01s -> 8430.10s]  Okay, I have to go now. Bye.
[8430.10s -> 8433.60s]  I'm just slowly trying to go through that.
[8433.60s -> 8450.46s]  Time is standing still. I don't want to miss much.
[8450.46s -> 8459.18s]  Kind of an empty house.
[8459.18s -> 8466.63s]  Nothing. It's just a hotel. Siphon.
[8466.63s -> 8473.70s]  Ooh, what's a siphon? What does this do?
[8473.70s -> 8477.51s]  This is a whip cream canister. Okay.
[8477.51s -> 8488.03s]  Found a whip cream canister.
[8488.03s -> 8503.99s]  Nothing in this oven. Chest over here.
[8503.99s -> 8507.30s]  I don't need to lock, which is good. Bread and gasoline.
[8507.30s -> 8510.30s]  What do you want?
[8510.30s -> 8515.89s]  It's quite a wide tunnel. There are finger marks on the ground.
[8515.89s -> 8518.89s]  It must have been dug up by using bare hands.
[8518.89s -> 8522.51s]  Large hole in the ground. Let me dig in peace.
[8522.51s -> 8525.51s]  I gotta shovel too!
[8525.51s -> 8528.51s]  Someone's inside this hole. I can barely make out a silhouette.
[8528.51s -> 8531.51s]  Looks like a grown man with long disheveled hair.
[8531.51s -> 8541.71s]  He's completely covered in mud.
[8541.71s -> 8549.74s]  What? Wait, this is my house?
[8549.74s -> 8560.90s]  Oh, shit. It is my house.
[8560.90s -> 8566.31s]  Is that because I had the shovel?
[8566.31s -> 8572.94s]  Oh, that's awesome. Okay, cool.
[8572.94s -> 8575.94s]  Go back in? I will. I'm just going to deposit my stuff that I picked up.
[8575.94s -> 8582.37s]  Didn't pick up any mushrooms.
[8582.37s -> 8585.37s]  I got lots more gasoline, which I'm just going to fill.
[8585.37s -> 8588.37s]  This is what we're going to do here.
[8588.37s -> 8591.80s]  I'm using both these completely.
[8591.80s -> 8598.38s]  Matchsticks, rope, alcohol, shiny stone, scrap metal, battery.
[8598.38s -> 8602.52s]  Bread, whatever. I'm out of room.
[8602.52s -> 8608.51s]  I'm going to get rid of these gasoline cans and dump them.
[8608.51s -> 8615.83s]  We're going to go generator, fill the whole thing.
[8615.83s -> 8623.68s]  Just max it out completely.
[8623.68s -> 8626.68s]  I'm really enjoying this stream. Hey, thanks. I am too.
[8626.68s -> 8635.98s]  This is kind of just a fun game.
[8635.98s -> 8638.98s]  Does anything else take gas?
[8638.98s -> 8641.98s]  Or should I actually just fill this?
[8641.98s -> 8651.82s]  What do I do?
[8651.82s -> 8654.82s]  I'm going to put some space let up then.
[8654.82s -> 8660.17s]  Go back here.
[8660.17s -> 8663.92s]  I don't need to repair anything. I've got another torch.
[8663.92s -> 8668.95s]  Anything else I need to bring to that?
[8668.95s -> 8676.61s]  I'm going to bring the knife, just in case.
[8676.61s -> 8680.81s]  I could probably bring another heal too.
[8680.81s -> 8685.71s]  I need some more rags. I'll be alright.
[8685.71s -> 8690.17s]  I'm going to heal with the bug thing.
[8690.17s -> 8695.25s]  Yeah, I'll be good.
[8695.25s -> 8699.58s]  I'll bring two to heal.
[8699.58s -> 8706.40s]  I'll bring two.
[8706.40s -> 8712.01s]  Let's go back. I have more room in my inventory now.
[8712.01s -> 8716.85s]  Where's the Animal Crossing OST?
[8716.85s -> 8721.56s]  I don't know. I lost it in the mail.
[8721.56s -> 8731.84s]  Creepy Animal Crossing.
[8731.84s -> 8736.49s]  Now the time has stopped again.
[8736.49s -> 8739.73s]  Shovel, there's my shortcut back, and then there's this person.
[8739.73s -> 8745.78s]  I've got another thing to explore.
[8745.78s -> 8753.29s]  I really think I'm at the stage of the game now where I probably need to make a gun.
[8753.29s -> 8758.96s]  But I know what's going to happen.
[8758.96s -> 8761.96s]  I'm going to make a gun, and I'm not going to shoot it one time.
[8761.96s -> 8765.20s]  I'm going to wait until the very last boss of the game.
[8765.20s -> 8770.20s]  And I'm going to unload the clip on the boss and miss seven or eight of the twelve shots.
[8770.20s -> 8777.14s]  I should probably just sell it.
[8777.14s -> 8780.44s]  Let's go back down here. Didn't I get a map?
[8780.44s -> 8798.64s]  Make a gun. Are you serious?
[8798.64s -> 8801.64s]  There's a door for this place.
[8801.64s -> 8813.58s]  How do I get in here?
[8813.58s -> 8816.58s]  This is one of the only survival horror games that I've played where getting a gun is still scary.
[8816.58s -> 8820.83s]  I can see that. Very much so.
[8820.83s -> 8824.07s]  Let's go up here first.
[8824.07s -> 8837.94s]  It's locked. I could open it with a lockpick.
[8837.94s -> 8846.17s]  What was the point of that? Was there actually no point to that?
[8846.17s -> 8849.73s]  Or did that give me access to this weird courtyard?
[8849.73s -> 8858.73s]  Bread oven.
[8859.73s -> 8862.73s]  Don't talk about pizza.
[8862.73s -> 8870.26s]  I can't eat that either.
[8870.26s -> 8879.96s]  I could open it with a lockpick.
[8879.96s -> 8891.33s]  I'm going to use all my lockpicks for this shit?
[8891.33s -> 8904.02s]  Dead here. Potato. Liar.
[8904.02s -> 8912.90s]  How many dead bodies are in here?
[8912.90s -> 8918.38s]  Oh my god.
[8918.38s -> 8947.07s]  I got my lockpicks back. Let's go make one.
[8947.07s -> 8954.79s]  I need a key. Lockpick, lockpick, lockpick, key.
[8954.79s -> 8957.79s]  Well, that sucks.
[8957.79s -> 8969.53s]  At least I know this is here.
[8969.53s -> 8972.53s]  Smash the door.
[8972.53s -> 8980.57s]  He missed something. Did I?
[8980.57s -> 8995.76s]  No, I didn't. I got them all.
[8995.76s -> 9013.78s]  Smash the door. That's not going to work.
[9013.78s -> 9020.46s]  Who the hell are you? I don't know.
[9020.46s -> 9025.37s]  A jar filled with cooked meat.
[9025.37s -> 9029.31s]  Help yourself, whatever you fancy.
[9029.31s -> 9041.24s]  I could open it with a lockpick.
[9041.24s -> 9062.72s]  Meat grinder?
[9062.72s -> 9065.72s]  Is that what they're eating people? Is that what this is? They're grinding up people.
[9065.72s -> 9075.42s]  The pig is just a show. It doesn't actually do anything. It doesn't mean anything.
[9075.42s -> 9078.42s]  I'm going to make something with this.
[9078.42s -> 9092.91s]  Bandage.
[9092.91s -> 9102.23s]  I got to go deposit some stuff.
[9102.23s -> 9105.66s]  I need a key.
[9105.66s -> 9111.19s]  I'm right here.
[9111.19s -> 9117.81s]  Kill this guy. Kill him.
[9117.81s -> 9121.18s]  You want me to kill that guy?
[9121.18s -> 9124.48s]  He didn't do anything.
[9124.48s -> 9127.91s]  He told me I could have whatever I wanted in his house.
[9127.91s -> 9130.91s]  That's sort of strange.
[9130.91s -> 9135.69s]  I'm alright.
[9135.69s -> 9145.44s]  I need to go get rid of this stuff.
[9145.44s -> 9149.19s]  I think there's only one more building I didn't check.
[9149.19s -> 9156.72s]  I think someone up here. Yeah, I didn't go up here.
[9161.86s -> 9164.86s]  There's actually a couple places I haven't been.
[9164.86s -> 9170.92s]  This town is huge.
[9170.92s -> 9176.14s]  Wait. This is a big-ass town.
[9176.14s -> 9183.59s]  Explain the corpses outside of his house.
[9183.59s -> 9187.28s]  He's grinding people up and he's feeding them to people.
[9187.28s -> 9193.34s]  Yeah? But he gave me three pipes.
[9193.34s -> 9196.64s]  And I got two pieces of wire from his house.
[9196.64s -> 9202.63s]  I can throw a knife in his head when I get back.
[9202.63s -> 9210.27s]  Where's the exit?
[9210.27s -> 9214.79s]  I wish I had a map. Where are those little things?
[9214.79s -> 9217.79s]  Down here?
[9217.79s -> 9227.93s]  Where the hell is that thing? There it is.
[9227.93s -> 9235.71s]  Alright, hold on.
[9235.71s -> 9239.40s]  I've got to get every item that I can get from here.
[9239.40s -> 9249.71s]  Time is freezing through the window.
[9249.71s -> 9252.71s]  Did I get anything to cook? What about the meat?
[9252.71s -> 9256.58s]  Wait, that meat I could probably cook.
[9256.58s -> 9262.04s]  That's unfortunate.
[9262.04s -> 9265.47s]  This is where it gets weird.
[9265.47s -> 9268.97s]  Because I can't carry any more of this stuff.
[9268.97s -> 9272.21s]  It's time to get rid of it. I have to get rid of some things.
[9272.21s -> 9275.45s]  I'm going to upgrade this shovel.
[9275.45s -> 9280.14s]  I want this to have better durability.
[9280.14s -> 9284.09s]  Attack to use less stamina.
[9284.09s -> 9287.09s]  More damage? No, more durability.
[9287.09s -> 9292.76s]  Is absolutely what I need.
[9292.76s -> 9298.43s]  Build gun. I need the weapon parts, which I don't have.
[9298.43s -> 9303.27s]  Homemade shotgun. No, I need the weapon parts.
[9303.27s -> 9307.71s]  You get that the next day.
[9307.71s -> 9310.71s]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to make a lockpick.
[9310.71s -> 9314.34s]  Then I'm going to make...
[9314.34s -> 9317.34s]  I'm going to upgrade this shovel, which is more durability.
[9317.34s -> 9330.40s]  Boom.
[9330.40s -> 9333.96s]  I'm going to hold onto it for sharpened.
[9333.96s -> 9337.39s]  I can build the homemade shotgun now.
[9337.39s -> 9344.46s]  Do I want to do that though? I don't think I want to do that.
[9344.46s -> 9348.02s]  Do I want to make this thing with the weapon parts?
[9348.02s -> 9351.90s]  No.
[9351.90s -> 9356.34s]  That's what I'm saying.
[9356.34s -> 9360.02s]  Wood.
[9360.02s -> 9363.26s]  I have to get rid of the board with the nails.
[9363.26s -> 9376.41s]  Just eat the potato.
[9376.41s -> 9379.41s]  Jar of meat. I got these glass bottles.
[9379.41s -> 9382.41s]  I'm not doing anything for me.
[9382.41s -> 9385.58s]  I'm just going to pretend I filled them with the meat.
[9385.58s -> 9392.54s]  Glass bottles. My wardrobe.
[9392.54s -> 9396.91s]  Stupid ass thing.
[9396.91s -> 9401.43s]  Where's my wardrobe?
[9401.43s -> 9406.58s]  This is where I'm going to put bottles.
[9406.58s -> 9412.23s]  Bottles are useless. I don't want bottles anymore.
[9412.23s -> 9419.31s]  Hold on.
[9419.31s -> 9423.06s]  My metal pipes are going in here.
[9423.06s -> 9428.42s]  This bone is going to go in here. I'm going to forget this exists.
[9428.42s -> 9432.94s]  Anything else I can put items in?
[9432.94s -> 9436.86s]  Put bottles in this table.
[9436.86s -> 9440.23s]  This is where the tape is going to go.
[9440.23s -> 9453.57s]  That's fine.
[9453.57s -> 9458.39s]  There's another wardrobe right here.
[9458.39s -> 9463.49s]  I'm going to be scattered around everywhere.
[9463.49s -> 9466.66s]  Bottles in the wardrobe.
[9466.66s -> 9469.66s]  Alcohol in the wardrobe.
[9469.66s -> 9473.16s]  Drugs in the wardrobe.
[9473.16s -> 9478.30s]  Metal pipe.
[9478.30s -> 9483.19s]  Bread in the wardrobe.
[9483.19s -> 9486.19s]  Drugs in the wardrobe.
[9486.19s -> 9489.56s]  Meat in the wardrobe.
[9489.56s -> 9492.86s]  You guys just have to remember where these items are because these don't stack.
[9492.86s -> 9497.19s]  Items that do not stack have to come out of here.
[9497.19s -> 9501.33s]  They're just taking up huge amounts of space that I could stack items in.
[9501.33s -> 9504.33s]  Batteries are going in the wardrobe.
[9504.33s -> 9509.10s]  I'm going to eat the potato.
[9509.10s -> 9515.14s]  Get this broken glass out of here.
[9515.14s -> 9518.14s]  Meat on the bone. I can't sell. There's nobody here.
[9518.14s -> 9521.64s]  Close.
[9521.64s -> 9526.85s]  Wardrobe. Batteries.
[9526.85s -> 9532.18s]  The bell in here too. And the fan belt.
[9532.18s -> 9536.90s]  Meat on the bone.
[9536.90s -> 9543.90s]  What are you talking about?
[9543.90s -> 9553.97s]  Where's the bone? What did I do with the bone?
[9553.97s -> 9569.80s]  This is what I was afraid of.
[9569.80s -> 9579.38s]  Cook the bone? What are you guys talking about?
[9579.38s -> 9582.74s]  The meat bone.
[9582.74s -> 9585.74s]  Stick bone.
[9585.74s -> 9591.93s]  Meat on the bone.
[9591.93s -> 9594.93s]  What are you guys saying to me?
[9594.93s -> 9600.97s]  I'm wasting time.
[9600.97s -> 9619.38s]  I'm going to make another one of these bandages.
[9619.38s -> 9626.97s]  Meat on the bone for fuck's sake.
[9626.97s -> 9632.26s]  I don't have scrap.
[9632.26s -> 9644.95s]  I have too many things.
[9644.95s -> 9655.22s]  Where's the wardrobe?
[9655.22s -> 9661.59s]  Now I need to organize this.
[9661.59s -> 9666.16s]  Otherwise I'm going to lose my mind.
[9666.16s -> 9669.16s]  Board with the nails is getting sold.
[9669.16s -> 9672.16s]  Rope.
[9672.16s -> 9676.17s]  Gas on the bottom.
[9676.17s -> 9680.05s]  Bottles of stuff that are filled is after that.
[9680.05s -> 9687.43s]  Empty bottles.
[9687.43s -> 9691.06s]  Empty bottles.
[9691.06s -> 9694.06s]  And other things that are not...
[9694.06s -> 9705.73s]  Fire related things.
[9705.73s -> 9713.70s]  Let's put the matchsticks.
[9713.70s -> 9719.10s]  How many potatoes do I have?
[9719.10s -> 9723.18s]  Why are these not stacked?
[9723.18s -> 9726.67s]  Bone down here.
[9726.67s -> 9729.98s]  I only need three of them. We can put that here.
[9729.98s -> 9735.01s]  Drugs next. Drugs and healing.
[9735.01s -> 9742.84s]  Medicinal stuff.
[9742.84s -> 9745.84s]  Drugs and medicinal material.
[9745.84s -> 9753.34s]  We're getting there.
[9753.34s -> 9756.90s]  Next is electronics part one.
[9756.90s -> 9783.48s]  Fire related or fuck's shit idiot meat on bone.
[9783.48s -> 9786.85s]  Fire related or fuck's shit idiot meat on bone.
[9786.85s -> 9794.95s]  Fire related or fuck's shit idiot meat on bone.
[9794.95s -> 9799.02s]  I'm going to freak out.
[9799.02s -> 9807.32s]  Do I need 50 matches?
[9807.32s -> 9810.32s]  Weapons.
[9810.32s -> 9813.93s]  Weapons up here.
[9813.93s -> 9818.58s]  That means this.
[9818.58s -> 9823.14s]  Bullets.
[9823.14s -> 9827.46s]  Wood.
[9827.46s -> 9834.15s]  Wood and rocks and shit.
[9834.15s -> 9839.55s]  And nails.
[9839.55s -> 9844.52s]  And healing and medicinal items.
[9844.52s -> 9851.26s]  It's just like doing one of those sliding puzzles.
[9851.26s -> 9858.01s]  Material.
[9858.01s -> 9863.49s]  Yes, I'm ready.
[9863.49s -> 9867.62s]  Okay, now it took me long enough.
[9867.62s -> 9871.50s]  Now I have to just go to...
[9871.50s -> 9895.59s]  Uh oh.
[9895.59s -> 9900.67s]  I have to barricade this.
[9900.67s -> 9903.67s]  I need three wood and I need wooden nails.
[9903.67s -> 9908.38s]  And scrap. Wooden nails.
[9908.38s -> 9919.61s]  And some wood.
[9919.61s -> 9924.51s]  Let's barricade this door closed. Turn on the generator and hang out.
[9924.51s -> 9928.14s]  It's just like a lot to process.
[9928.14s -> 9934.19s]  Generator on. Board up this door.
[9934.19s -> 9942.22s]  Did I need anything else?
[9942.22s -> 9945.22s]  Well, I'm trapped in here now. Did I need anything else?
[9945.22s -> 9955.80s]  The left window.
[9955.80s -> 9968.64s]  Meat and bone.
[9968.64s -> 9971.82s]  I'm going to take a knife out and I want to break this.
[9971.82s -> 9974.82s]  Alright, I'm good. Let's go. Anything else I need to do in the meantime?
[9974.82s -> 9978.38s]  I have heals.
[9978.38s -> 9981.38s]  I can throw some... Yeah, let's throw some bottles.
[9981.38s -> 9985.06s]  I already have some broken here.
[9985.06s -> 9988.06s]  Check this out. Let's get it on the ground right here.
[9988.06s -> 9991.56s]  Let's do this a couple times. Like right there.
[9991.56s -> 9994.74s]  Because there is no... What are we doing?
[9994.74s -> 9997.74s]  I don't have a trap right there so this is going to be alright.
[9997.74s -> 10002.19s]  Just put a little bit of glass there.
[10002.19s -> 10013.18s]  Let's throw a bottle on the ground and break one.
[10013.18s -> 10017.70s]  Do I have to pick this up or will it just...
[10017.70s -> 10026.06s]  Do I have to actually set this as a trap?
[10026.06s -> 10031.28s]  I can leave it. Okay. That's good to know.
[10031.28s -> 10044.79s]  I'm going to do the same thing right here. I'm ready.
[10044.79s -> 10050.02s]  Bring it on. Meat bone.
[10050.02s -> 10053.02s]  Alright, I need you guys to explain to me what the hell this is.
[10053.02s -> 10056.02s]  Is this like a meme or something that I'm missing?
[10056.02s -> 10064.12s]  Jeff just gave five community subs. We should be focusing on that.
[10064.12s -> 10067.12s]  Thank you, Jeff, for the five community subs. Appreciate it.
[10067.12s -> 10073.29s]  Use meat on the bone.
[10073.29s -> 10076.29s]  I'm going to do that one time and if it doesn't do anything,
[10076.29s -> 10090.26s]  I'm not going to stream for two weeks.
[10090.26s -> 10100.53s]  Good. Good. Alright, let's go.
[10100.53s -> 10105.88s]  It's a win-win. How is that a win-win?
[10105.88s -> 10115.63s]  What do you mean? Morty. Morty.
[10115.63s -> 10120.65s]  Morty, you put the meat on the bone, Morty. Morty.
[10120.65s -> 10129.39s]  Why am I getting minus two?
[10129.39s -> 10132.39s]  Somebody in chat wrote that and I was just referencing it.
[10132.39s -> 10148.16s]  I just said it.
[10149.16s -> 10152.16s]  Alright, pay attention. Pay attention, folks.
[10152.16s -> 10157.51s]  We've got an alien coming through.
[10157.51s -> 10160.94s]  First alien of the night.
[10160.94s -> 10173.34s]  I'm going to throw this knife right between the eyes.
[10173.34s -> 10176.51s]  There's no trap here, so I have to do it. I have to throw it right away.
[10176.51s -> 10187.35s]  Did he give up? What did he stop for?
[10187.35s -> 10190.85s]  He decided to go different. There's two of them.
[10190.85s -> 10211.40s]  Uh-oh.
[10211.40s -> 10224.61s]  Uh-oh. Fuck. Where's my knife?
[10224.61s -> 10233.74s]  Where's the knife?
[10233.74s -> 10240.18s]  Shit. I've got to get somebody stuck in a trap.
[10240.18s -> 10258.84s]  Oh, no. Don't panic. Don't panic.
[10258.84s -> 10272.46s]  Fucking trap.
[10272.46s -> 10275.46s]  I threw the knife and it didn't kill him.
[10275.46s -> 10280.56s]  It kills everybody in one hit,
[10280.56s -> 10283.56s]  but the one guy that comes through the left window
[10283.56s -> 10286.56s]  doesn't die in one hit from the knife.
[10286.56s -> 10302.22s]  His two friends died in one hit.
[10302.22s -> 10310.73s]  Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit.
[10310.73s -> 10313.73s]  No, no, no, no, no. I need this. I need weapon part.
[10313.73s -> 10317.35s]  Here, you can take these potatoes. I'm not going to eat them.
[10317.35s -> 10322.19s]  I need to get that weapon part because I want to build a gun.
[10322.19s -> 10327.93s]  Quick, use the music stand.
[10327.93s -> 10330.93s]  Alright, it's time to make a gun. I'm sick of this.
[10330.93s -> 10339.78s]  I get medium caliber bullet,
[10339.78s -> 10343.66s]  medium caliber magazine.
[10343.66s -> 10357.30s]  Shiny stone. I'm making a gun.
[10357.30s -> 10360.30s]  So that I need weapon part. I need 450.
[10360.30s -> 10364.89s]  What is this going to get me here?
[10364.89s -> 10367.89s]  That's two, three, four, ten.
[10367.89s -> 10373.82s]  Alright, now I just need 40 more
[10373.82s -> 10376.82s]  and I'm going to make a gosh darn gun.
[10376.82s -> 10381.66s]  Why am I selling gun ammo for a gun?
[10381.66s -> 10384.66s]  Because I want a pistol.
[10384.66s -> 10387.66s]  That's a medium gun. That's a medium sized gun.
[10387.66s -> 10391.02s]  So, you can take the bread too. I'm not going to eat it.
[10391.02s -> 10394.78s]  Take the board with nails. I'm not going to eat it.
[10394.78s -> 10406.14s]  He doesn't have enough room in his inventory.
[10406.14s -> 10410.92s]  Wait, you have to hold...
[10410.92s -> 10413.92s]  Are you going to have... If I give you bread,
[10413.92s -> 10425.54s]  are you going to have it forever?
[10425.54s -> 10430.51s]  Oh, this is not good. I have to get him...
[10430.51s -> 10439.30s]  What do I give you? Pills? Yeah, okay.
[10439.30s -> 10442.61s]  I'm not going to sell the bread then. Yes, I am. Who cares?
[10442.61s -> 10446.81s]  What about alcohol? You got alcohol stored there, right?
[10446.81s -> 10451.76s]  Okay.
[10451.76s -> 10454.76s]  I'm going to go sell you one of my many tubes.
[10454.76s -> 10461.70s]  What's in this wardrobe?
[10461.70s -> 10465.58s]  No, that's important stuff.
[10465.58s -> 10470.48s]  Here we go. You can have a metal... No, I might need that.
[10470.48s -> 10473.48s]  You can buy and sell at the same time. Yeah, I know.
[10473.48s -> 10479.09s]  I need $450, man. I don't want to buy anything right now.
[10479.09s -> 10482.09s]  I need $450 reputation dollars.
[10482.09s -> 10511.04s]  Alright, you can have a tube. I've decided.
[10511.04s -> 10518.87s]  Do you have bottles? What does he have a stack of?
[10518.87s -> 10531.78s]  He has a stack of... Buy the part.
[10531.78s -> 10539.88s]  That was the right thing, right? Yeah.
[10539.88s -> 10544.02s]  Gun. That's what that person meant when they said
[10544.02s -> 10547.02s]  buy and sell at the same time. Sorry.
[10547.02s -> 10550.02s]  I'm stupid. I didn't...
[10550.02s -> 10553.02s]  I thought you meant like I could... I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[10553.02s -> 10556.02s]  Anyways, it's time to make a pistol.
[10556.02s -> 10559.90s]  Small caliber, semi-automatic pistol.
[10562.29s -> 10565.29s]  Small caliber magazine, small caliber pistol.
[10565.29s -> 10576.13s]  Bingo. Gun with no ammo? I got ammo right here.
[10576.13s -> 10585.50s]  I got two clips.
[10585.50s -> 10592.24s]  I need another scrap metal. I gotta buy one.
[10592.24s -> 10595.24s]  It's loaded. Yeah, that's fine. How many shots does it have?
[10595.24s -> 10609.65s]  Where the hell is it?
[10609.65s -> 10612.82s]  How many bullets does this have? How do I shoot this...
[10612.82s -> 10621.50s]  How do I aim this? I don't want to fire it accidentally.
[10621.50s -> 10627.03s]  Okay. So you aim it like that.
[10627.03s -> 10642.21s]  How many shots are in it? Okay. I'm ready.
[10642.21s -> 10646.02s]  I got my gun for emergency situations. I have a magazine for it.
[10646.02s -> 10651.18s]  I need another scrap metal to repair the shovel.
[10651.18s -> 10654.18s]  And then I can move on with my day.
[10654.18s -> 10692.14s]  What do I need? Ten? Just give me all of them.
[10692.14s -> 10702.33s]  Repaired. Good. I have nothing to cook.
[10702.33s -> 10705.50s]  I'm gonna go back to the weird house.
[10705.50s -> 10709.13s]  This is nice and organized. I need
[10709.13s -> 10713.65s]  a gas guzzler. Get rid of this.
[10715.78s -> 10718.78s]  Inventory space is increasing, so this is good.
[10718.78s -> 10722.33s]  Jar of meat. Jar of meat on bone.
[10722.33s -> 10725.33s]  I'm not gonna use that. Meat and bone.
[10725.33s -> 10733.29s]  See you guys in two weeks.
[10733.29s -> 10736.29s]  I need to make more traps, which I need scrap for that. Of course I do.
[10736.29s -> 10741.19s]  Meat, not jar of meat.
[10741.19s -> 10757.97s]  Okay. I'm gonna store this.
[10757.97s -> 10760.97s]  I have two, three heals. Let's just take them all.
[10760.97s -> 10764.27s]  Extra torch.
[10764.27s -> 10767.27s]  Anything else to satisfy me?
[10767.27s -> 10773.46s]  Yeah. Let's go.
[10773.46s -> 10780.02s]  Jar of bone in meat.
[10780.02s -> 10786.26s]  Alright. I'm ready.
[10786.26s -> 10789.26s]  Repair item. We're good. I'm gonna head back to the town.
[10789.26s -> 10792.88s]  And see if I can figure something else out.
[10792.88s -> 10796.31s]  I do have to go pick up my items, though.
[10796.31s -> 10799.31s]  And the generator has been on the whole time.
[10799.31s -> 10802.31s]  Why did everybody not scream at me?
[10803.31s -> 10824.07s]  What's up with that, huh?
[10824.07s -> 10827.07s]  If you reload, you lose the magazine. Thank you for telling me that.
[10827.07s -> 10832.58s]  I would not have known that.
[10832.58s -> 10839.52s]  Pretty good. Get rid of this.
[10839.52s -> 10843.72s]  Keep the rag in case I need to make another...
[10843.72s -> 10848.43s]  No, I'm not gonna need to. Chicken head, keep that.
[10848.43s -> 10852.50s]  Watch, keep that. Good to go.
[10852.50s -> 10857.65s]  Alright. Off I go.
[10857.65s -> 10860.65s]  Let's move. Back to the town.
[10860.65s -> 10866.77s]  Scrap metal. Need it. A lot of it.
[10866.77s -> 10875.90s]  How do you reload? It's probably R.
[10875.90s -> 10880.35s]  So I'm not going to press R.
[10880.35s -> 10890.38s]  Alright. There's a spot up here that I didn't check out.
[10890.38s -> 10893.94s]  Oh, it's a reference to something else. It's a reference to another game.
[10893.94s -> 10896.94s]  Well, this is Darkwood.
[10896.94s -> 10903.50s]  This is not that other video game that you're referencing.
[10903.50s -> 10910.90s]  Alright, then down here is the... Wait, what's that?
[10910.90s -> 10913.90s]  Nobody taught you how to use the door.
[10913.90s -> 10919.00s]  It's Chicken Lady.
[10954.93s -> 10963.06s]  Alright, show item.
[10993.69s -> 10998.59s]  See him? He never came back.
[11001.90s -> 11013.25s]  Item found.
[11035.18s -> 11038.18s]  These devilish trees have overgrown everything.
[11065.98s -> 11072.81s]  It was a long time ago, but you remember it's still my little hand, don't you?
[11072.81s -> 11079.70s]  Thank the Lord for our sow.
[11079.70s -> 11083.70s]  Poor thing seems sickly, but she has more life in her than the lot of us, if you ask me.
[11083.70s -> 11087.70s]  Only thanks to her we got something to put in the pot these days.
[11087.70s -> 11091.78s]  Okay, so take this. He went to see this fellaceum. He never came back.
[11091.78s -> 11095.46s]  I have to find this doctor.
[11095.46s -> 11102.08s]  Holy mother, this creep again. May the devil take him and his blasted violin.
[11102.08s -> 11105.08s]  The old lady turns in red and starts to scream.
[11105.08s -> 11109.54s]  Devil fucked your mother.
[11109.54s -> 11113.67s]  Get away from me house.
[11113.67s -> 11128.22s]  Where?
[11128.22s -> 11129.22s]  Location already marked Pig Shed.
[11129.22s -> 11151.26s]  Why do I not have a map of this place?
[11151.26s -> 11152.26s]  These are hens, right?
[11152.26s -> 11156.02s]  Oh, another toolbox. I'm not taking... I don't pick up bottles anymore.
[11156.02s -> 11160.86s]  Cross covered in mud and sticks.
[11160.86s -> 11163.86s]  A wooden cross covered in mud and sticks.
[11163.86s -> 11185.51s]  A key.
[11185.51s -> 11194.50s]  None of my keys fit.
[11194.50s -> 11197.50s]  Tractor, gas, steering wheel.
[11197.50s -> 11200.50s]  Doesn't the spaceship guy need a steering wheel?
[11200.50s -> 11207.51s]  Ruin. Scorch remains of the wooden hen house structure.
[11207.51s -> 11210.51s]  Scorch remains of the wooden hen house structure.
[11210.51s -> 11222.07s]  Hello? Basket full of eggs.
[11222.07s -> 11232.27s]  Chicken egg.
[11232.27s -> 11237.82s]  More chicken eggs. Nice.
[11237.82s -> 11254.74s]  A red egg.
[11254.74s -> 11259.96s]  That's a red egg. Cool.
[11259.96s -> 11265.94s]  I think I got everything.
[11265.94s -> 11273.78s]  Wooden chicken egg.
[11273.78s -> 11276.78s]  Can I smash this?
[11276.78s -> 11298.82s]  It's a metal door. I can't smash a metal door.
[11298.82s -> 11301.82s]  What about on the outside?
[11301.82s -> 11306.34s]  This is one of those scenarios where you go to your kid's recital.
[11306.34s -> 11309.34s]  And it gets introduced as...
[11309.34s -> 11312.97s]  And here's little Gary Elbertson.
[11312.97s -> 11332.30s]  Oh, that's my son. Come on.
[11332.30s -> 11338.49s]  We're practicing. It's my son, yeah.
[11338.49s -> 11341.49s]  He's trying. He's practicing a lot.
[11341.49s -> 11344.49s]  Lately he's in the garage and...
[11344.49s -> 11350.14s]  What the fuck does your kid do, huh?
[11350.14s -> 11354.28s]  I bet your kid plays the piano.
[11354.28s -> 11367.42s]  That's easy compared to the violin. You don't know shit.
[11367.42s -> 11374.49s]  What is going on? I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
[11374.49s -> 11382.70s]  Somebody under here? His musician is the car.
[11382.70s -> 11387.74s]  It's like that Lindsay Lohan movie.
[11387.74s -> 11390.74s]  It's not my fault. I know it doesn't sound too great.
[11390.74s -> 11393.74s]  I won't play anymore. I'm sorry.
[11393.74s -> 11398.26s]  I know it's under there.
[11398.26s -> 11401.26s]  The chicken lady's hut. You're not afraid of her?
[11401.26s -> 11404.43s]  You're brave.
[11404.43s -> 11407.43s]  Have you seen her? The pretty lady.
[11407.43s -> 11410.43s]  She's the most beautiful lady in the world.
[11410.43s -> 11413.43s]  I watch her through the cracks in the windows.
[11413.43s -> 11416.43s]  She changes when I watch her. She gets more beautiful. I play for her.
[11416.43s -> 11419.43s]  I want to be happy because a chicken lady locked her in that room.
[11419.43s -> 11422.43s]  She envies her. She won't allow anyone to see her. Even me.
[11422.43s -> 11425.43s]  She knows very well that during the last Capala night,
[11425.43s -> 11428.43s]  I fished out the pretty lady's wreath from the river.
[11428.43s -> 11431.43s]  Yes, sir. The chicken lady knows what it means.
[11431.43s -> 11434.43s]  Oh, yes, I'll become the pretty lady's husband.
[11434.43s -> 11437.43s]  We will walk hand in hand, sir. I will play for her, sir.
[11437.43s -> 11440.80s]  I tried to release her, but the chicken lady,
[11440.80s -> 11443.80s]  she chased me off. She always does.
[11443.80s -> 11446.80s]  I also look for the second key at Mr. Jan's,
[11446.80s -> 11449.80s]  but now he's disappeared. I don't know how to get in his house.
[11449.80s -> 11463.20s]  Yes, sir.
[11463.20s -> 11467.98s]  Okay, so it was Mr. Jan.
[11467.98s -> 11470.98s]  Second key, Mr. Jan's, but he's disappeared.
[11470.98s -> 11474.22s]  I don't know how to get into his house.
[11474.22s -> 11477.22s]  So kind. So very kind. You're just like him.
[11477.22s -> 11480.22s]  My daddy, but my papa has changed, mister.
[11480.22s -> 11483.22s]  Just like my mommy. They will not listen to me.
[11483.22s -> 11486.22s]  They won't hear how sad I am, sir.
[11486.22s -> 11489.22s]  But I am not boring you, sir. Please don't go.
[11489.22s -> 11492.78s]  Please. They hear me out. Don't go.
[11492.78s -> 11496.14s]  Nervous, grunting, I heard from under the tractor.
[11496.14s -> 11501.18s]  Perhaps you could help me. Leave board.
[11501.18s -> 11504.18s]  Please find the key, good sir, to the pretty lady's room.
[11504.18s -> 11507.18s]  The chicken lady has it. Well, Mr. Jan also has it.
[11507.18s -> 11510.48s]  I saw him recently near the well.
[11510.48s -> 11513.48s]  He used to play with me. We threw rocks into the well,
[11513.48s -> 11516.48s]  and I looked into our reflections while making silly faces.
[11516.48s -> 11519.48s]  Do it, or else my face will stay that way.
[11519.48s -> 11522.48s]  And now the water in the well is always hazy.
[11522.48s -> 11525.85s]  It shows these weird images.
[11525.85s -> 11528.85s]  The well is here in the village. Maybe you will find him in there.
[11528.85s -> 11531.85s]  He used to hang around often.
[11531.85s -> 11534.85s]  He's staring into the well as if looking for something.
[11534.85s -> 11537.85s]  I must hide now. I'll hide from the chicken lady,
[11537.85s -> 11558.56s]  the chicken lady of that place where they used to keep all the grain
[11558.56s -> 11561.56s]  in the southeastern part of the forest.
[11561.56s -> 11564.56s]  What about this road?
[11564.56s -> 11567.56s]  My mommy once told me this road.
[11567.56s -> 11576.29s]  She said people used to travel it.
[11576.29s -> 11579.29s]  They would leave their houses and walk it during the night.
[11579.29s -> 11582.29s]  I was scared of this story.
[11582.29s -> 11585.29s]  I was afraid my mommy would go out too and leave me behind.
[11585.29s -> 11590.64s]  Have you heard about the sow?
[11590.64s -> 11593.64s]  The villagers keep this sow nearby, the pig shed, they call it.
[11593.64s -> 11596.64s]  Mother of all pigs, they say, it's beautiful,
[11596.64s -> 11599.64s]  but I've never seen it. They don't allow me near her.
[11599.64s -> 11602.64s]  They chase me off. They always chase me off.
[11602.64s -> 11607.02s]  He drops his gaze.
[11607.02s -> 11610.02s]  Maybe you would be able to see her, mister. If you managed to get inside,
[11610.02s -> 11613.02s]  maybe you could take even a wee piece of meat from me.
[11613.02s -> 11617.28s]  The guy's asking a lot. I've never eaten a pig and have heard it's very tasty.
[11617.28s -> 11622.18s]  Would you take some meat from me?
[11622.18s -> 11626.90s]  This person's freaking me out. All right, we've got some info though.
[11626.90s -> 11634.36s]  Chicken lady's bad.
[11634.36s -> 11647.25s]  I can just break the window.
[11647.25s -> 11650.94s]  The barricade's too strong to dismantle.
[11650.94s -> 11656.22s]  All right, I've got to get to the well.
[11656.22s -> 11665.34s]  The well needs to be repaired though.
[11665.34s -> 11669.41s]  Chicken lady's fucked up.
[11669.41s -> 11674.12s]  Smash it, you dumb dumb. I want to do it the right way.
[11674.12s -> 11682.46s]  I want to do it the correct way. I've got to go up.
[11682.46s -> 11685.46s]  Time's still frozen? Yeah, time is frozen forever here somehow.
[11685.46s -> 11698.03s]  There's one more house up here.
[11699.03s -> 11703.87s]  This is where I was last time.
[11703.87s -> 11709.67s]  Woman examine, crate search.
[11709.67s -> 11716.69s]  Doll. Don't touch that until I talk.
[11716.69s -> 11725.11s]  The woman stares at the ground with a dead look.
[11725.11s -> 11728.11s]  I'll trade you half drank gasoline for a doll.
[11728.11s -> 11739.91s]  Doll.
[11739.91s -> 11749.17s]  Kill the pig.
[11749.17s -> 11787.27s]  Another house over here.
[11787.27s -> 11790.27s]  Can I get in? Metal door.
[11790.27s -> 11795.11s]  No windows.
[11795.11s -> 11801.87s]  Metal door locked. I need a key.
[11801.87s -> 11809.96s]  Of course I do.
[11809.96s -> 11812.96s]  I'm going to head back to...
[11812.96s -> 11820.81s]  I got a new thing on my map in that silent forest.
[11820.81s -> 11823.81s]  Here is the shrine.
[11823.81s -> 11827.86s]  The well was down here?
[11827.86s -> 11830.86s]  Where was that well?
[11830.86s -> 11833.86s]  Last time I saw him he was down the well.
[11833.86s -> 11840.16s]  Well rotting.
[11840.16s -> 11847.18s]  I would think that's where he is.
[11847.18s -> 11856.69s]  This side.
[11856.69s -> 11862.92s]  I still need a key.
[11862.92s -> 11872.29s]  I'll probably get it later.
[11872.29s -> 11876.17s]  This guy is pissed off.
[11876.17s -> 11880.11s]  I need a chain.
[11880.11s -> 11883.11s]  I need that.
[11883.11s -> 11886.11s]  I think I've exacerbated all options.
[11886.11s -> 11889.11s]  It's time.
[11889.11s -> 11893.18s]  There's something in here though.
[11893.18s -> 11899.91s]  What should I do?
[11899.91s -> 11907.74s]  Should I just kill this person?
[11907.74s -> 11919.56s]  I feel like I should just smash.
[11919.56s -> 11927.47s]  I don't know.
[11927.47s -> 11940.94s]  There's no talking.
[11940.94s -> 11943.94s]  I can't do it unless I know what's happening.
[11943.94s -> 11951.05s]  I can't do it.
[11951.05s -> 11958.26s]  I have to come back here with one of those chains.
[11958.26s -> 11962.20s]  Sorry guys.
[11962.20s -> 11968.58s]  I have to go back to the silent forest and look at that place that he told me to look.
[11968.58s -> 11983.51s]  Store these things that I have now.
[11983.51s -> 11989.36s]  There's a chain in the village.
[11989.36s -> 11996.30s]  Let's do it.
[11996.30s -> 12001.58s]  I've got more of these things.
[12001.58s -> 12007.19s]  Scary.
[12007.19s -> 12012.42s]  Chicken eggs I can just eat them.
[12012.42s -> 12019.30s]  Let's store this crap.
[12019.30s -> 12022.30s]  Chicken head doesn't do shit.
[12022.30s -> 12028.86s]  I'll keep the eggs.
[12028.86s -> 12033.95s]  Let's make another bandage.
[12033.95s -> 12036.95s]  I was supposed to get a bunch of scrap.
[12036.95s -> 12040.75s]  Let's go find that new place that's marked on the map.
[12040.75s -> 12043.75s]  There it is.
[12043.75s -> 12056.64s]  The day just started.
[12056.64s -> 12060.01s]  I'm ready to move.
[12061.01s -> 12069.75s]  It's like 8 o'clock in the morning.
[12069.75s -> 12075.81s]  I haven't even done anything.
[12075.81s -> 12081.48s]  The electronic stuff.
[12081.48s -> 12085.36s]  The guy that likes you to give him electronics.
[12085.36s -> 12093.98s]  I don't really have any electronics to give this person.
[12093.98s -> 12100.80s]  The steering wheel.
[12100.80s -> 12107.62s]  I'll bring a couple batteries.
[12107.62s -> 12115.73s]  I want to keep the wires though.
[12115.73s -> 12118.73s]  I'll give him the steering wheel.
[12118.73s -> 12131.36s]  Let's go.
[12131.36s -> 12145.59s]  Look at his blueprint.
[12145.59s -> 12149.98s]  Tire, steering wheel, battery.
[12149.98s -> 12165.61s]  Wait a minute.
[12165.61s -> 12168.91s]  Car battery.
[12168.91s -> 12184.30s]  Is that the fan belt?
[12184.30s -> 12190.59s]  It's somewhere else.
[12190.59s -> 12193.90s]  It's over here.
[12193.90s -> 12200.75s]  What else does he need?
[12200.75s -> 12203.93s]  Fan belt, battery.
[12203.93s -> 12210.22s]  This is like a muffler.
[12210.22s -> 12214.55s]  What is this?
[12214.55s -> 12226.18s]  I can just give it to him now.
[12226.18s -> 12241.77s]  Let's go.
[12241.77s -> 12244.77s]  I could have saved a little bit of time if I went through the hole.
[12244.77s -> 12256.31s]  You're right.
[12256.31s -> 12264.67s]  Always get the mushrooms.
[12264.67s -> 12281.16s]  Don't forget the pig shit.
[12281.16s -> 12284.16s]  There's an elk here.
[12284.16s -> 12287.72s]  You're in the way.
[12287.72s -> 12293.97s]  This is the weird poison forest.
[12293.97s -> 12296.97s]  Just don't step in any poison and I'll be alright.
[12296.97s -> 12302.82s]  Metal down here.
[12302.82s -> 12310.90s]  I think I already did all this.
[12310.90s -> 12316.06s]  I didn't get these.
[12316.06s -> 12319.06s]  This is not supposed to be a wood run.
[12319.06s -> 12329.66s]  This is supposed to be a scrap metal run.
[12329.66s -> 12337.05s]  Don't step on a mushroom.
[12337.05s -> 12345.52s]  There's the house.
[12345.52s -> 12355.42s]  I have some stuff for you.
[12355.42s -> 12361.92s]  I have some materials that you're going to want.
[12361.92s -> 12365.22s]  Steering wheel.
[12365.22s -> 12368.22s]  A trajectory guidance system.
[12368.22s -> 12371.22s]  This will fit perfectly in my rocket.
[12371.22s -> 12374.22s]  Have you seen my rocket?
[12374.22s -> 12377.22s]  It's almost as pretty as Gargarin's.
[12377.22s -> 12380.22s]  Would you bring them to me, the other parts?
[12380.22s -> 12383.22s]  I would love to fly to space and into the moon and into Mars and Jupiter and the sun.
[12383.22s -> 12386.72s]  I mean, I would land at night.
[12386.72s -> 12392.78s]  The boy suddenly looks into my eyes.
[12392.78s -> 12399.46s]  Look for old detractors.
[12399.46s -> 12403.21s]  We'll find my missing parts there. Tires.
[12403.21s -> 12407.09s]  I'm getting 100 space rocket chassis.
[12407.09s -> 12410.09s]  Only two more to go. Fan belt.
[12410.09s -> 12414.22s]  Hold door frame stabilizer.
[12414.22s -> 12417.22s]  A hybrid rocket engine.
[12417.22s -> 12420.22s]  Yay, finally, I have everything I need. Go your way now.
[12420.22s -> 12423.22s]  Go now, please. I need to install these parts of my beautiful rocket.
[12423.22s -> 12426.53s]  And then we off I go.
[12426.53s -> 12429.53s]  I'm receiving tons of shit.
[12429.53s -> 12432.53s]  I will wave to you when I'm on my way to where no man's been before.
[12432.53s -> 12437.74s]  Do you know the doctor?
[12437.74s -> 12440.74s]  Beautiful, but I don't see Gargarin in it.
[12440.74s -> 12443.74s]  I've never seen a photo without Gargarin in it before.
[12443.74s -> 12446.74s]  Gargarin was this cosmonaut, a man who flew to the stars.
[12446.74s -> 12449.74s]  I'll reach the stars, too, one day.
[12449.74s -> 12455.28s]  Maybe tomorrow, for example. I just need to find the screw for the cover.
[12455.28s -> 12464.39s]  Blueprints for the rocket.
[12464.39s -> 12467.39s]  Postcard with the portrait of the man. Oh, I have one, too.
[12467.39s -> 12473.56s]  I did it. But before you leave, what do you have here?
[12473.56s -> 12494.46s]  He has a chain.
[12494.46s -> 12510.28s]  Cable. Chain. Couple of wires.
[12510.28s -> 12515.50s]  I mean, just clean the guy out. He's gone. Map of the old woods.
[12515.50s -> 12519.00s]  I should get this, too. Get the flashlight.
[12519.00s -> 12523.33s]  Flashlight, map. Now, what do I have to give you?
[12523.33s -> 12530.20s]  Right, I was going to give you nothing.
[12530.20s -> 12534.85s]  Get the flashlight. I need 200 reputation with them.
[12534.85s -> 12546.84s]  Some of these have to go.
[12546.84s -> 12550.66s]  Flashlight's too expensive. I could probably make one of these.
[12550.66s -> 12559.34s]  Get the military flashlight.
[12559.34s -> 12562.83s]  There's a chain in the village. Are we certain of that?
[12562.83s -> 12574.52s]  Yes. You're going to have to point me in the direction where it is.
[12574.52s -> 12578.78s]  So now that leaves with...
[12578.78s -> 12585.29s]  I have the cable, the military flashlight.
[12585.29s -> 12588.29s]  Oh, I was going to give you a couple of batteries. That's what it was.
[12588.29s -> 12594.28s]  That's what it was. But I'm going to... No, I don't.
[12594.28s -> 12597.28s]  You gave me weapon parts? Wait a minute. Okay, this is important.
[12597.28s -> 12601.08s]  I'm going to give you a healer.
[12601.08s -> 12605.47s]  Because... And, I don't know, a fucking log.
[12605.47s -> 12622.58s]  Don't want that. Normal is better than military.
[12622.58s -> 12629.09s]  This is going to be a fight and chat here, I think.
[12629.09s -> 12634.38s]  Why is military more expensive?
[12634.38s -> 12646.51s]  That seems odd.
[12646.51s -> 12656.66s]  Military is brighter but uses way too many batteries.
[12656.66s -> 12669.25s]  I'm going to do the regular one.
[12669.25s -> 12683.42s]  Did it... Stunt. Stunt.
[12683.42s -> 12696.22s]  Buy the nails.
[12696.22s -> 12700.10s]  No, I don't want nails. I wish I had enough for this.
[12700.10s -> 12704.50s]  Map of the Old Woods.
[12704.50s -> 12707.50s]  I want it. I want it. I want it.
[12707.50s -> 12710.50s]  I don't care if it sucks. I want it.
[12710.50s -> 12719.24s]  How many do I need? 40 more points.
[12719.24s -> 12723.55s]  I can do that with a torch.
[12723.55s -> 12728.26s]  Sell the batteries? No, now I need the batteries.
[12728.26s -> 12732.27s]  Because I have a flashlight now. Here, take a bandage.
[12732.27s -> 12738.58s]  60, 70, 80, 92.
[12738.58s -> 12741.76s]  No, I need that torch. No, I don't. Here, take this shitty torch.
[12741.76s -> 12744.76s]  No. Alright, take it.
[12744.76s -> 12756.93s]  Give me it. Done. Okay.
[12756.93s -> 12765.40s]  It's been a pleasure. Goodbye.
[12765.40s -> 12768.40s]  Now I have to go up to the pig shed.
[12768.40s -> 12779.94s]  I think I should go back.
[12779.94s -> 12782.94s]  I'm so conflicted on what I want to do right now.
[12782.94s -> 12785.94s]  Map of the Woods. Church ruins.
[12785.94s -> 12794.78s]  Church ruins? Oh shit, okay.
[12794.78s -> 12801.03s]  There's a hydrant up there.
[12801.03s -> 12804.03s]  I'm just going to keep doing what I was doing. I'm going to the pig shed.
[12804.03s -> 12809.64s]  No, that's too dangerous.
[12810.64s -> 12815.93s]  I'm going back.
[12815.93s -> 12818.93s]  I'm going back and we're going to take the super runner. Let's do it.
[12818.93s -> 12850.04s]  Poison.
[12850.04s -> 12853.58s]  I don't even know what I'm doing.
[12853.58s -> 12858.74s]  I get very easily overwhelmed in games like these.
[12858.74s -> 12861.98s]  Because when you have a finite amount of time to do something,
[12861.98s -> 12864.98s]  and the game tells you to do 10 things at the same time,
[12864.98s -> 12867.98s]  I get overwhelmed.
[12867.98s -> 12871.35s]  It's very simple for me to lose concentration completely.
[12871.35s -> 12879.26s]  I really like this game though. It's very fun.
[12879.26s -> 12888.38s]  It's very interesting.
[12888.38s -> 12892.77s]  So I am in my possession.
[12892.77s -> 12899.27s]  I can now upgrade the workbench.
[12899.27s -> 12904.29s]  A sickle? I can make armor after this.
[12904.29s -> 12907.29s]  Single shot shotgun.
[12907.29s -> 12910.91s]  All right. I need more scrap,
[12910.91s -> 12913.91s]  which is the point of the entire mission that I went on.
[12913.91s -> 12919.70s]  What's going on? I have to make these into wooden planks.
[12919.70s -> 12928.76s]  Let's go ahead and deposit them all.
[12928.76s -> 12934.88s]  Need more gas in there, but I'll just take them.
[12934.88s -> 12948.02s]  Cook the mushrooms that I got.
[12948.02s -> 12951.02s]  The flashlight now takes the place of the torch,
[12951.02s -> 12954.02s]  so I do not need torches anymore ever again.
[12954.02s -> 12959.17s]  Technically.
[12959.17s -> 12966.95s]  Make sure I get all the wood out of here so I can compile it wrong.
[12966.95s -> 12971.09s]  I have a lot of batteries.
[12971.09s -> 12976.95s]  No more wood or wooden planks. Let's go fill this up.
[12976.95s -> 12982.50s]  Go get the chain. I'm going to.
[12982.50s -> 12991.86s]  I'm going to get the chain.
[12991.86s -> 13013.39s]  Get out of here. What are you doing?
[13013.39s -> 13023.10s]  Generate this is still fine, but I'll top it off.
[13023.10s -> 13026.10s]  All right. Let's put the rest of the wood that's in here.
[13026.10s -> 13029.10s]  Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[13029.10s -> 13036.10s]  I now have more wood than I know what to do with.
[13036.10s -> 13044.71s]  Good. Turn around.
[13044.71s -> 13048.40s]  Now I've got to get my wood pile here.
[13048.40s -> 13051.40s]  I don't know. Stones. It's time to just remove them completely.
[13051.40s -> 13054.77s]  Just get rid of them.
[13054.77s -> 13059.42s]  I have no reason to have these stones. Zero.
[13059.42s -> 13062.78s]  They don't do a damn thing for me.
[13062.78s -> 13073.43s]  They're just here. Weapon parts.
[13073.43s -> 13076.43s]  The batteries away. Put the welder away until I can actually use it.
[13076.43s -> 13085.35s]  Don't turn that on.
[13085.35s -> 13090.06s]  All right. I'm getting rid of the rocks and then I should be good to.
[13090.06s -> 13113.32s]  Where are those rocks?
[13119.02s -> 13122.90s]  Oh, my God. Give me a break.
[13122.90s -> 13127.36s]  It's like a super dog.
[13127.36s -> 13133.03s]  Holy shit. He's going to kill me.
[13133.03s -> 13137.10s]  Dead huge dog. Cookable meat. What?
[13137.10s -> 13143.16s]  All right. I'm going to do the bug thing. Moth thing.
[13143.16s -> 13155.78s]  How much is this worth? 60. Nice.
[13155.78s -> 13162.47s]  All right. I'm just throw them on the ground.
[13162.47s -> 13169.36s]  At this stage of the game.
[13169.36s -> 13172.36s]  I'm going to put just throw them over here. If there's any stupid reason why I need them, they're all over here.
[13172.36s -> 13185.01s]  If there's a dumb reason for them to be needed.
[13186.01s -> 13194.75s]  Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well.
[13194.75s -> 13197.75s]  Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well.
[13197.75s -> 13201.06s]  Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well.
[13201.06s -> 13207.43s]  Wait, I just need the chain. OK, build the well.
[13207.43s -> 13217.78s]  Build the well. Scrap.
[13217.78s -> 13221.66s]  Itchy inside of my ear. That means like a ghost is in the room, right?
[13221.66s -> 13225.41s]  I know that means something weird. There's like a ghost in here.
[13225.41s -> 13230.95s]  Just like when you sneeze, it means somebody's talking about you.
[13230.95s -> 13244.16s]  All right. Build the well. I need to heal.
[13244.16s -> 13251.05s]  No, that's if your ears get red. Dumb, dumb.
[13251.05s -> 13256.08s]  OK, we're looking for near the chicken lady's hut.
[13256.08s -> 13265.02s]  There is a person who is on fire, who is burned.
[13265.02s -> 13274.70s]  Where is this person? There's a burnt corpse over here somewhere.
[13274.70s -> 13292.01s]  OK, looking for somebody burnt.
[13292.01s -> 13295.31s]  Burnt wood logs. I'll take it.
[13295.31s -> 13305.26s]  Pig. That's a wrong house.
[13305.26s -> 13308.26s]  It's dummy. Dumb, dumb.
[13308.26s -> 13316.15s]  This isn't the chicken lady's house. Where is the chicken lady's house?
[13316.15s -> 13328.77s]  Down to the right. I hear you.
[13328.77s -> 13333.01s]  I haven't even been down here. I see you between the trees.
[13333.01s -> 13340.39s]  You will not squeeze between them.
[13340.39s -> 13344.39s]  I would use these next words more carefully if I were you.
[13344.39s -> 13356.30s]  I didn't even say the line right and I leaned in for it.
[13356.30s -> 13365.21s]  Who are you? Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me.
[13365.21s -> 13375.97s]  That would be very nice. Mushrooms.
[13375.97s -> 13378.97s]  Why am I itchy? My eyes are itchy.
[13378.97s -> 13389.16s]  My inside of my ear is itchy. My eyes are itchy. What's happening to my body?
[13389.16s -> 13400.06s]  Cool. You have fleas in my eyes.
[13400.06s -> 13403.06s]  I got fleas in my eyeballs.
[13403.06s -> 13414.62s]  Lady's house. I think it's over here. This is it right here.
[13414.62s -> 13418.62s]  OK, looking for a burnt thing.
[13418.62s -> 13427.85s]  Burnt thing. The tractor.
[13427.85s -> 13432.37s]  You. Destroyed well.
[13432.37s -> 13446.60s]  Now this ear is itchy. What the fuck is happening?
[13446.60s -> 13456.99s]  Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back.
[13456.99s -> 13475.83s]  He's losing it. What?
[13475.83s -> 13478.83s]  In the house bottom right.
[13478.83s -> 13482.90s]  That person wrote that so fast that half of it was not in caps.
[13482.90s -> 13485.90s]  And then they just said, I'm melting. OK, I'll listen to that person.
[13485.90s -> 13492.41s]  He said it needs to be done.
[13492.41s -> 13498.90s]  It will help, he said. I don't understand.
[13498.90s -> 13508.02s]  Note. Burn a mix of herbs in the oven.
[13508.02s -> 13512.22s]  Lavage.
[13512.22s -> 13517.50s]  Combomile and nettle.
[13517.50s -> 13520.50s]  Lounge, chamomile and nettle.
[13520.50s -> 13523.50s]  Keep the patient warm twice a day.
[13523.50s -> 13529.23s]  One tablespoon of sauerkraut juice by mouth.
[13529.23s -> 13557.86s]  Do I have to do that? What a foul stench.
[13557.86s -> 13560.86s]  Its arms and legs are bound with a chain.
[13560.86s -> 13566.33s]  Bingo. In the oven.
[13566.33s -> 13588.88s]  Time to fix the well.
[13588.88s -> 13593.34s]  Keep the patient warm. Yeah, that's fucked up.
[13593.34s -> 13597.76s]  You're not. He's not under here anymore.
[13597.76s -> 13606.70s]  Fix the well. Look at the time.
[13606.70s -> 13611.22s]  Yeah, it's frozen. It's fine.
[13611.22s -> 13616.50s]  Take a bandage. No, I just need to stay next to a light and do the moth.
[13616.50s -> 13619.50s]  All right, can I activate moth and then shine the light in my face?
[13619.50s -> 13630.84s]  With a flashlight? I feel like I should be able to do that.
[13630.84s -> 13642.98s]  I need a lamp or something.
[13642.98s -> 13649.16s]  I'm not going in here.
[13649.16s -> 13655.47s]  Use the well, you dipshit.
[13655.47s -> 13658.47s]  What's with the light up there? What's with everybody with this well?
[13658.47s -> 13663.70s]  By the way, I looked into it.
[13663.70s -> 13668.54s]  Full moon is in like two days.
[13668.54s -> 13688.40s]  Just saying. I'm going to heal.
[13688.40s -> 13694.84s]  There's going to be something down here. Should I get the gun?
[13694.84s -> 13707.81s]  I'm going to be ready. This is going to be like a boss fight.
[13707.81s -> 13710.81s]  Okay, there's a return to the surface.
[13710.81s -> 13714.05s]  Torch and a flare.
[13714.05s -> 13725.16s]  It's going to get dark in here.
[13726.16s -> 13740.79s]  What the hell is scribbled on the ground?
[13740.79s -> 13754.51s]  Is it like a scorpion?
[13754.51s -> 13778.28s]  I hear somebody walking around.
[13778.28s -> 13807.73s]  Super mushroom. God.
[13807.73s -> 13834.65s]  Do I have batteries?
[13834.65s -> 13837.65s]  There's a key down here. Just find the key before I run out of power and light.
[13840.40s -> 13844.86s]  And I'm going to take out this gun.
[13844.86s -> 13847.86s]  If there's a monster down here, this is a gun scenario.
[13847.86s -> 13854.62s]  If it is anything besides those guys with the halberds, this is a gun scenario.
[13856.62s -> 13869.97s]  This is a gun scenario. Gun, gun scenario.
[13869.97s -> 13874.74s]  This is a gun scenario.
[13874.74s -> 13878.43s]  No, it's not. This thing is little.
[13878.43s -> 13888.95s]  I can't see. I'm going to wait until the turns are going out.
[13888.95s -> 13923.54s]  I'm going to bash his fucking head and fuck out of here.
[13923.54s -> 13951.77s]  Let's go. Heal.
[13951.77s -> 13965.63s]  Where is it? Nice 90s voice actor dub.
[13965.63s -> 13973.99s]  Get over here before this burns out.
[13973.99s -> 14088.18s]  What the fuck is it?
[14088.18s -> 14121.74s]  It's you. The doll. Odd meat.
[14121.74s -> 14138.29s]  No, don't throw this. Okay.
[14138.29s -> 14171.29s]  Where's this key that exists down here apparently?
[14171.29s -> 14184.94s]  And the music's getting louder. Why?
[14184.94s -> 14197.30s]  There's so many mushrooms here.
[14197.30s -> 14205.26s]  What is this? Return to the... Wait, I made it?
[14205.26s -> 14239.96s]  I did it. The hell am I?
[14239.96s -> 14250.69s]  This thing breathing? How do I get the hell out of here?
[14250.69s -> 14255.27s]  McCull. McCull. K.
[14255.27s -> 14264.58s]  A couple of eggs. Plastic chickens.
[14264.58s -> 14268.01s]  More eggs. Is it bread?
[14268.01s -> 14291.07s]  So many eggs.
[14291.07s -> 14296.87s]  Key covered in chicken feces.
[14296.87s -> 14299.87s]  Oh shit. Okay.
[14299.87s -> 14333.64s]  Where does that key go?
[14333.64s -> 14360.74s]  I got the key.
[14360.74s -> 14367.88s]  So now I have this chicken key.
[14367.88s -> 14371.70s]  Which, yeah, that's the thing that the wolf man wanted.
[14371.70s -> 14382.47s]  I know what we're doing tomorrow.
[14382.47s -> 14385.47s]  For the music kid.
[14385.47s -> 14390.94s]  This is a choice we have to make. I'm not sure what to do.
[14390.94s -> 14397.38s]  Nice oblivion NPC face.
[14397.38s -> 14408.28s]  I can just open the door. Should I just open the door?
[14408.28s -> 14417.34s]  What if I just go in? What if I just go in the room?
[14417.34s -> 14425.26s]  It's a little hen with an odd little shrug. I wish I could find a fat little bug.
[14425.26s -> 14428.26s]  Upon seeing you, the old lady stops humming. What do you want?
[14428.26s -> 14432.26s]  I thought I was going to try to show her the key.
[14432.26s -> 14445.87s]  Be like, haha.
[14445.87s -> 14448.87s]  I'm going to do the thing. I'm going to give the key to...
[14448.87s -> 14456.06s]  I'm going to give the key to the wolf man.
[14456.06s -> 14462.63s]  Just look in there first.
[14462.63s -> 14467.02s]  Should I not do this?
[14467.02s -> 14470.02s]  Go in the room. Are you sure? Alright, I'll do it.
[14470.02s -> 14473.02s]  I'm going in. Going in. Going in.
[14473.02s -> 14479.06s]  Going in.
[14479.06s -> 14484.93s]  He said don't. Wolfman said don't do it.
[14484.93s -> 14495.45s]  Wolfman said don't do it.
[14495.45s -> 14528.62s]  But what's behind the door? It's up to me now.
[14528.62s -> 14531.62s]  I'm not going to do it. I'm going to go give the key to the wolfman.
[14531.62s -> 14534.62s]  That doesn't mean I'm not going to bash the old lady's head in.
[14534.62s -> 14546.89s]  Kidding.
[14546.89s -> 14557.30s]  Friendship with wolfman secured. You can do both?
[14557.30s -> 14560.60s]  I don't know how accurate that is though.
[14560.60s -> 14563.60s]  Because every time I go towards the door...
[14563.60s -> 14566.60s]  The door is hot. There's a fire behind that door.
[14566.60s -> 14569.60s]  And it's you guys.
[14569.60s -> 14572.60s]  Half of you are in front of the door trying to open it.
[14572.60s -> 14575.60s]  And the other half of you are creating heat to not open the door.
[14575.60s -> 14578.60s]  So I'm walking up to the door and it's like fucking fire.
[14578.60s -> 14581.60s]  Don't open the door!
[14581.60s -> 14584.60s]  I'm going to burn my hand! And then everybody behind me is trying to push me to get me to touch the door.
[14584.60s -> 14591.62s]  I'm going to burn my hand if I touch the door.
[14591.62s -> 14594.62s]  When I walked up to the door it was like a sea of don't.
[14594.62s -> 14597.62s]  Don't do it! He said don't do it! Please don't do it!
[14597.62s -> 14600.62s]  And then I'm like okay I'm going to back off.
[14600.62s -> 14603.92s]  Yeah fucking wuss! You're the biggest piece of shit I've ever met in my life!
[14603.92s -> 14606.92s]  And then the fucking door cools down.
[14606.92s -> 14609.92s]  And I'm like okay I'll walk towards the door again and it turns red.
[14609.92s -> 14613.42s]  Again. I don't know what to do.
[14613.42s -> 14616.42s]  I don't know what to do. No. I'm not going to do it.
[14616.42s -> 14619.42s]  I'm going to go to the wolf. Because the wolf gave me a specific task.
[14619.42s -> 14622.42s]  And it was to do this.
[14622.42s -> 14626.62s]  Up here. That's what we're doing.
[14626.62s -> 14631.33s]  That is the plan. You're going to regret it.
[14631.33s -> 14635.34s]  Well then that's my own fault.
[14635.34s -> 14638.34s]  Oh god. It's 17.
[14638.34s -> 14648.94s]  I didn't get any scrap.
[14648.94s -> 14655.50s]  I have a lot of things to cook.
[14655.50s -> 14658.98s]  40, 40, 40, 40, 48.
[14658.98s -> 14661.98s]  40, 40, 40, 40, 40.
[14661.98s -> 14682.55s]  4800 points!
[14682.55s -> 14689.17s]  Acid base? Yeah I like it better.
[14689.17s -> 14693.18s]  What is this? It's just an eagle eye thing. Who cares?
[14693.18s -> 14704.59s]  Acid base. Nothing else I can cook right?
[14704.59s -> 14707.59s]  That doesn't matter right now. What matters is you boarding up some doors.
[14707.59s -> 14713.76s]  Like right now.
[14713.76s -> 14719.50s]  Like why are you still sitting here like this?
[14719.50s -> 14723.18s]  I don't know why I'm still standing here. I need to board up doors.
[14723.18s -> 14745.42s]  Why am I still sitting here?
[14745.42s -> 14748.42s]  Okay. What's this? I still have a trap. This is scrap.
[14748.42s -> 14755.43s]  I have no more traps.
[14755.43s -> 14762.88s]  Thankfully my shovel is still good.
[14762.88s -> 14766.63s]  What about down here? This is alright still? Yep.
[14766.63s -> 14772.69s]  Barricade this door. Good.
[14772.69s -> 14778.15s]  Good. Broken glass is still there.
[14778.15s -> 14781.90s]  Move this sofa just a little bit.
[14781.90s -> 14787.19s]  Well I think it matters.
[14787.19s -> 14790.19s]  And then I'm going to put a trap on this wall over here. I have a chain trap.
[14790.19s -> 14793.82s]  There it is. Get it on here.
[14793.82s -> 14798.27s]  Lay it like right here.
[14798.27s -> 14807.77s]  Move the trap. What are we talking about?
[14807.77s -> 14813.25s]  Here we go. Is he really going to say acid base and not play it?
[14813.25s -> 14828.57s]  Yeah I think.
[14828.57s -> 14832.96s]  Heals? No.
[14832.96s -> 14836.78s]  I'm really prepared here with no heals.
[14836.78s -> 14841.04s]  That just means I can't get hit. Wait no I do have a heal.
[14841.04s -> 14846.07s]  I've got them off. Play the damn song.
[14846.07s -> 14850.85s]  I can't. I cannot alt tab.
[14850.85s -> 14853.85s]  No I've got to focus on this and then I've got to give the wolf the key.
[14853.85s -> 14857.86s]  Just don't get hit. I know it's not hard.
[14857.86s -> 14870.81s]  It actually is kind of hard.
[14870.81s -> 14873.81s]  I will make the 16 people that spam this link in chat happy.
[14873.81s -> 14876.81s]  I will.
[14876.81s -> 14880.50s]  Because I'm a pleaser. I'm a crowd pleaser.
[14880.50s -> 14888.79s]  That's what you're going to get. And it's not a crowd pleaser.
[14888.79s -> 14891.79s]  There's 4,000 people here and like 20 people want me to play this.
[14891.79s -> 14897.08s]  So this is actually not me pleasing the crowd. It's me pleasing a few people.
[14897.08s -> 14904.80s]  I'm a crowd pleaser. You're a gaggle pleaser.
[14904.80s -> 14978.09s]  Here they come.
[14978.09s -> 15027.39s]  This sucks. Does this not do anything?
[15027.39s -> 15048.15s]  Front door. I think it's over here again.
[15048.15s -> 15051.33s]  That's it. There's no autoplay on by the way.
[15051.33s -> 15054.70s]  You know something funny about that video?
[15054.70s -> 15057.70s]  One of the recommended videos after that.
[15057.70s -> 15060.70s]  In the 9 like Hollywood squares stuff.
[15060.70s -> 15063.70s]  You know like the 9 thumbnails.
[15063.70s -> 15070.26s]  Is Germacraft episode 1.
[15070.26s -> 15075.28s]  What does this mean? What's going on?
[15075.28s -> 15080.31s]  Somebody's spawning in here. What do I do about this?
[15080.31s -> 15083.31s]  I need some backseat gaming. What is that?
[15083.31s -> 15086.31s]  Backseat gaming. What is it? What do I do?
[15086.31s -> 15091.34s]  Don't look at it. Backseat gaming.
[15091.34s -> 15097.85s]  Don't look into it. Should I get out of the room? Is it going to explode?
[15097.85s -> 15101.52s]  Should I get out of the room? Get out of the room.
[15101.52s -> 15110.26s]  I want to get out of the room. Yes.
[15110.26s -> 15134.99s]  I stepped in the trap.
[15134.99s -> 15138.17s]  And then the sofa.
[15138.17s -> 15149.98s]  Blocked me from leaving the room.
[15149.98s -> 15152.98s]  Can you imagine somebody.
[15152.98s -> 15155.98s]  Barricading up themselves in a fucking room.
[15155.98s -> 15158.98s]  First of all. Second of all.
[15158.98s -> 15162.35s]  Somebody rolls a grenade in the room.
[15162.35s -> 15165.35s]  And then the person goes. Let's say there's like 6 or 7 other people in that room.
[15165.35s -> 15168.85s]  Hey! Should we run out of the room?
[15168.85s -> 15171.85s]  Should we run out of the room? I think we should probably run out of this room.
[15171.85s -> 15174.85s]  Let's run out of the room. And then that person sprints.
[15174.85s -> 15177.85s]  Directly into a trap that they put up.
[15177.85s -> 15181.22s]  They step into a bear trap that they assemble.
[15181.22s -> 15184.22s]  And then a fucking monster comes in.
[15184.22s -> 15187.22s]  And pushes the sofa directly into them.
[15187.22s -> 15190.22s]  And they get locked with the bear trap on their foot.
[15190.22s -> 15193.22s]  Still against the wall. Well at least the other 6 or 7 of you could leave.
[15193.22s -> 15199.08s]  Like you're just raring to go.
[15199.08s -> 15202.08s]  Waiting at the Olympics for the guy to shoot the gun in the air.
[15202.08s -> 15207.24s]  To start running into the trap.
[15207.24s -> 15223.98s]  At least whoever else is in that room could easily get out.
[15223.98s -> 15229.27s]  I put these traps here.
[15229.27s -> 15232.27s]  Get out of the fucking room.
[15232.27s -> 15235.27s]  My only...the wires.
[15235.27s -> 15238.27s]  The copper wires. The fiber optic wires.
[15238.27s -> 15241.27s]  That connected from this part of my brain to this part of my brain.
[15241.27s -> 15244.27s]  Was just get out as fast as possible.
[15245.27s -> 15252.16s]  I don't...what is that thing?
[15252.16s -> 15255.16s]  Why did somebody drop like a gas grenade in the room? What is that?
[15255.16s -> 15270.74s]  How did this even get over here?
[15270.74s -> 15274.23s]  That's what happens when you play Left 4 Dead like that, by the way.
[15274.23s -> 15277.23s]  I just did the thing where everybody goes into the bathroom.
[15277.23s -> 15280.23s]  And if you've never played Left 4 Dead, that seems like a great idea.
[15280.23s -> 15283.66s]  Hey, all of us go in the bathroom.
[15283.66s -> 15286.66s]  And then all the special infected.
[15286.66s -> 15289.66s]  Just find you.
[15289.66s -> 15292.66s]  And the boomers blow up right outside the door.
[15292.66s -> 15295.66s]  The smoker is just grabbing people. The tank is getting in there.
[15295.66s -> 15298.66s]  Everyone just gets in the bathroom. And then everybody dies.
[15298.66s -> 15304.32s]  I admit, what a fun game. Oh, generator.
[15304.32s -> 15316.97s]  Well, now I have to make another door.
[15316.97s -> 15327.55s]  You have a 9-volt brain. Get out of here.
[15327.55s -> 15337.51s]  Okay, so I have...why do I only have five...oh, I died. Right.
[15337.51s -> 15340.51s]  So I need another scrap.
[15340.51s -> 15343.51s]  And then I can upgrade the workshop again.
[15343.51s -> 15346.51s]  This is a scrap day only.
[15346.51s -> 15349.51s]  We're going to go talk to the wolf, and it's scrap day only.
[15349.51s -> 15362.74s]  Yeah, everybody runs out of ammo.
[15362.74s -> 15365.74s]  If you do the bathroom strategy.
[15365.74s -> 15369.30s]  And then somebody has to go try to find a weapon.
[15369.30s -> 15376.30s]  Okay, here we go.
[15376.30s -> 15379.30s]  Scrap only. I'm going to keep the pills.
[15379.30s -> 15382.30s]  Deposit the scrap. I'll keep the potatoes.
[15382.30s -> 15385.30s]  I will take a couple of batteries with me. Flashlight can stay.
[15385.30s -> 15388.30s]  Torch can stay in emergency situations only.
[15388.30s -> 15391.30s]  Wood goes back. Bottle goes back.
[15391.30s -> 15398.42s]  Potato stays. Let's go.
[15398.42s -> 15401.98s]  All right, buddy. I'm going to move out of here.
[15401.98s -> 15404.98s]  This is a scrap run. Go to the wolf's camp.
[15404.98s -> 15415.82s]  Let's go. Do I have any heals?
[15415.82s -> 15419.32s]  You don't? Yes, you do. I'll be fine.
[15419.32s -> 15430.56s]  Somebody said I should go do the other stuff in this woods first,
[15430.56s -> 15433.56s]  or I lock myself out of it.
[15433.56s -> 15441.54s]  I lock myself out of doing this stuff again.
[15441.54s -> 15445.03s]  So what were the other quests I had?
[15445.03s -> 15452.56s]  I don't remember anything besides the pig farm.
[15452.56s -> 15463.08s]  Let's just head over there.
[15463.08s -> 15469.97s]  I need to get scrap to upgrade.
[15469.97s -> 15473.14s]  And I need it to make traps and everything.
[15473.14s -> 15503.89s]  Is there anything else I can do in here?
[15503.89s -> 15514.49s]  I feel like this is an important place. Might as well look at it.
[15514.49s -> 15534.67s]  There's the gramophone. Oh, he's in here.
[15534.67s -> 15548.45s]  The boy stops playing and lowers his head, avoiding my sight.
[15548.45s -> 15555.59s]  Have you heard about the sow?
[15555.59s -> 15558.59s]  The villagers keep the sow in the nearby pig shed.
[15558.59s -> 15561.90s]  They call it the mother of all pigs.
[15561.90s -> 15564.90s]  They say it's beautiful, but I've never seen it.
[15564.90s -> 15567.90s]  They don't allow me near her. They chase me off. They always chase me off.
[15567.90s -> 15571.39s]  Maybe you would be able to see her, mister.
[15571.39s -> 15576.10s]  If you manage to get inside, maybe you could take a wee piece of meat from me.
[15576.10s -> 15582.02s]  Should I show them? Should I show them the key?
[15582.02s -> 15590.73s]  Wait, that... No.
[15590.73s -> 15596.06s]  I'll get you some meat. Pig shed.
[15596.06s -> 15604.49s]  Let's go.
[15608.49s -> 15627.57s]  All right. Proved.
[15627.57s -> 15630.57s]  Right when I walked out.
[15630.57s -> 15633.57s]  You're just hiding the fact that you're not very good at the violin.
[15633.57s -> 15640.01s]  It's an LOL situation.
[15640.01s -> 15643.82s]  Is that a big dog? Yeah, this is a meat dog, I think.
[15650.94s -> 15655.31s]  Gah!
[15655.31s -> 15665.64s]  Yes, yes, I'm wearing a bathing suit.
[15665.64s -> 15668.64s]  Okay, it's laundry day.
[15668.64s -> 15681.78s]  Fuck. Those dogs suck.
[15681.78s -> 15687.65s]  Those dogs are ridiculous. You can't dodge those.
[15687.65s -> 15696.14s]  I have to shoot that dog. That is ridiculous.
[15696.14s -> 15706.80s]  That's ridiculous. You just suck.
[15706.80s -> 15709.80s]  Dodging only goes backwards and it just... That's not... No, no.
[15709.80s -> 15712.80s]  The big dogs... No. I am not going to hear that from you guys today.
[15712.80s -> 15716.30s]  I'm not going to hear that from you guys today.
[15716.30s -> 15719.47s]  That thing was ridiculous.
[15719.47s -> 15733.27s]  I ain't going to hear that from you today.
[15733.27s -> 15736.96s]  Just kill it. I've worn bathing suits as clothes outside.
[15736.96s -> 15741.03s]  You're good. I know.
[15741.03s -> 15744.03s]  Wait, am I supposed to be embarrassed at the fact that I'm wearing a bathing suit? They're light.
[15744.03s -> 15747.03s]  They're very thin. And they do complete coverage.
[15747.03s -> 15753.41s]  What's the problem? I'm incredibly comfortable right now.
[15753.41s -> 15757.98s]  Okay, I'm going back.
[15757.98s -> 15763.58s]  Can I repair this? I need to repair this.
[15763.58s -> 15769.06s]  If this dog is dead, then I'm going to get my shit back.
[15769.06s -> 15786.64s]  Those are worse than Dark Souls dogs.
[15786.64s -> 15789.64s]  Yeah, they're the mega dogs because they have a thing that they drop that's like a hundred essence.
[15789.64s -> 15794.48s]  I'm sorry, I ain't going to have somebody tell me that dying to the mega dog is bad.
[15794.48s -> 15798.54s]  It's a mega dog.
[15798.54s -> 15839.90s]  And I'm going to hit it in the face. Whatever.
[15839.90s -> 15844.87s]  Did that guy just punch that thing and kill it?
[15844.87s -> 15849.33s]  He just punched it once. Holy shit, this guy is ridiculous.
[15849.33s -> 15862.09s]  That's free antlers for me.
[15862.09s -> 15867.22s]  All right, let's go. Poison.
[15867.22s -> 15872.74s]  And we go up. I need metal.
[15872.74s -> 15883.54s]  Metal. Metal.
[15883.54s -> 15895.78s]  Round two, dog. Super dog.
[15895.78s -> 15900.75s]  Okay, we've been here. Go up to the pig shed.
[15900.75s -> 15904.50s]  Try middle mouse.
[15904.50s -> 15907.50s]  I have it on my other mouse, but yeah, I do it sometimes.
[15907.50s -> 15914.01s]  It takes way too much stamina for me.
[15914.01s -> 15918.14s]  It takes more than half a bar of stamina.
[15918.14s -> 15923.67s]  Look at what that...
[15923.67s -> 15937.39s]  What are you talking about? All right, here we go.
[15937.39s -> 15940.39s]  What is that thing? Bugs? Ooh, there's an egg sack thing here.
[15940.39s -> 15951.34s]  Embryo.
[15951.34s -> 15954.34s]  Ooh, I remember this shit.
[15954.34s -> 15966.59s]  I'm getting some expensive items.
[15966.59s -> 15970.15s]  Okay, I'm here. I need to get a piece of meat from the pig.
[15970.15s -> 15983.62s]  I did my best.
[15998.30s -> 16002.30s]  Squish this between your teeth.
[16002.30s -> 16018.98s]  That's disgusting. I don't think I'm going to do that.
[16018.98s -> 16022.67s]  Oh, banana cream.
[16022.67s -> 16033.19s]  Is this the pig? I can't collect meat. Banana cream pie.
[16033.19s -> 16038.54s]  Straight up banana cream pie.
[16038.54s -> 16043.83s]  I told you he had it coming.
[16043.83s -> 16049.94s]  He loved that pig and she ate him.
[16049.94s -> 16052.94s]  She wouldn't have eaten him if some fucker hadn't cut the cables.
[16052.94s -> 16057.78s]  How the fuck didn't he get electrocuted?
[16057.78s -> 16063.37s]  Who's going to feed it now?
[16063.37s -> 16067.70s]  It's the only sow in the village.
[16067.70s -> 16073.24s]  It will starve if it dies.
[16073.24s -> 16081.26s]  Do you guys care that I'm here?
[16081.26s -> 16108.95s]  Who in the flying fuck goes there?
[16108.95s -> 16114.42s]  Get out of here or I will break your legs.
[16114.42s -> 16121.35s]  All right, good thing I got the gun.
[16121.35s -> 16138.98s]  Pitchfork. I'll take it. Don't want that.
[16138.98s -> 16145.86s]  This guy took like three full bullets each.
[16145.86s -> 16155.50s]  We got it.
[16155.50s -> 16158.50s]  There's going to be a huge pig in here.
[16158.50s -> 16165.58s]  This is what's happening.
[16165.58s -> 16179.69s]  This is going to be a giant pig. It's going to be horrible.
[16179.69s -> 16196.08s]  Don't come any closer.
[16196.08s -> 16199.08s]  I hit the pig in the face.
[16199.08s -> 16202.08s]  I'm sorry.
[16202.08s -> 16218.04s]  These things are worth a lot of money.
[16218.04s -> 16223.58s]  What? What happened?
[16223.58s -> 16231.72s]  Okay.
[16231.72s -> 16234.72s]  I don't know. It was attacking me.
[16234.72s -> 16246.79s]  It was attacking me.
[16246.79s -> 16253.92s]  But I didn't mean to.
[16253.92s -> 16259.46s]  What should I do with the skateboard?
[16259.46s -> 16277.73s]  I don't have any heels.
[16277.73s -> 16284.66s]  Are you eating this pig?
[16284.66s -> 16287.66s]  It's late at night.
[16287.66s -> 16322.01s]  I have to get out of this.
[16322.01s -> 16328.13s]  How do they get in here?
[16328.13s -> 16352.01s]  I'm in trouble.
[16352.01s -> 16357.23s]  I'm in big trouble.
[16357.23s -> 16385.46s]  Get away from me.
[16385.46s -> 16408.59s]  I didn't get any scrap.
[16408.59s -> 16413.86s]  This is terrible.
[16413.86s -> 16417.68s]  I should know that's going to happen by now.
[16417.68s -> 16440.70s]  I don't care.
[16440.70s -> 16448.21s]  I'm not going to die from that.
[16448.21s -> 16454.33s]  I'm here.
[16454.33s -> 16461.76s]  Cook. Embryo.
[16461.76s -> 16464.76s]  Store all my shit quickly.
[16464.76s -> 16474.66s]  I'll figure it out later.
[16474.66s -> 16537.14s]  We're good.
[16537.14s -> 16545.86s]  Do I eat a potato?
[16545.86s -> 16549.66s]  I'm going to use the pitchfork for melee.
[16549.66s -> 16560.56s]  Why are these over here?
[16560.56s -> 16579.13s]  Couch.
[16579.13s -> 16598.67s]  I'm ready for you.
[16598.67s -> 16601.85s]  If I don't use the pitchfork,
[16601.85s -> 16623.33s]  then I'm going to break the shovel.
[16623.33s -> 16626.33s]  What's the swing animation?
[16626.33s -> 16629.33s]  That's not very good.
[16629.33s -> 16643.50s]  Check the left window.
[16643.50s -> 16657.49s]  Why am I moving?
[16657.49s -> 16669.35s]  I should not be moving.
[16669.35s -> 16682.18s]  I think I'm going to use the gun.
[16682.18s -> 16685.35s]  The gun's going to break.
[16685.35s -> 16694.42s]  That's what I was thinking.
[16694.42s -> 16697.42s]  Here comes our first visitor of the night.
[16697.42s -> 16701.17s]  I'm going to stand up here so he gets in the trap.
[16701.17s -> 16717.85s]  He actually comes through and lands in the trap.
[16717.85s -> 16722.88s]  Is the red durability not ammo?
[16722.88s -> 16751.59s]  What are the crows?
[16751.59s -> 16777.92s]  Something over here.
[16777.92s -> 16782.30s]  Why is it not...
[16782.30s -> 16796.29s]  I have two hours.
[16796.29s -> 16847.26s]  Take a quick peek.
[16847.26s -> 16855.49s]  There's something right behind this door.
[16855.49s -> 16862.94s]  I'm safe.
[16862.94s -> 16881.02s]  Day 16.
[16881.02s -> 16901.72s]  Nice.
[16901.72s -> 16916.46s]  Another day.
[16916.46s -> 16922.18s]  Now I need to go back to here.
[16922.18s -> 16925.18s]  They mentioned the word cable.
[16925.18s -> 16929.83s]  I'm going to probably assume that I need to bring the cable.
[16929.83s -> 16939.84s]  Now, what exactly do I want to get rid of here?
[16939.84s -> 16945.64s]  These pitchforks I don't think I'm going to use.
[16945.64s -> 16948.64s]  I might keep one of them though,
[16948.64s -> 16951.64s]  just in case I need it for something.
[16951.64s -> 16955.07s]  Repair the shovel.
[16955.07s -> 16964.07s]  Let me see the upgrade here.
[16964.07s -> 16967.31s]  I need three more scrap.
[16967.31s -> 16971.13s]  I think he sells them.
[16971.13s -> 16977.49s]  Nice.
[16977.49s -> 16981.43s]  Go to where the thing was.
[16981.43s -> 16988.26s]  Workbench upgrade.
[16988.26s -> 16992.97s]  Exploding barrel.
[16992.97s -> 16995.97s]  Light armor.
[16995.97s -> 17003.16s]  Gas bottle.
[17003.16s -> 17009.28s]  Don't I have one of these somewhere?
[17009.28s -> 17019.29s]  I think they have one.
[17019.29s -> 17022.72s]  I'm going to sell.
[17022.72s -> 17025.72s]  I don't have anything to cook, right?
[17025.72s -> 17029.73s]  No.
[17029.73s -> 17033.99s]  We're going to go for the big pig.
[17033.99s -> 17042.19s]  Battery shoes.
[17042.19s -> 17045.75s]  What else did I have here?
[17045.75s -> 17049.82s]  Take that out now.
[17049.82s -> 17055.16s]  Put on some shoes.
[17055.16s -> 17058.16s]  This cannot come out now.
[17058.16s -> 17068.04s]  I don't have to store this everywhere.
[17068.04s -> 17079.02s]  Let's clean this up.
[17079.02s -> 17085.66s]  Let's make some molotovs.
[17085.66s -> 17092.29s]  I've got plenty of alcohol.
[17092.29s -> 17099.61s]  I'm going to make a molotov.
[17099.61s -> 17102.61s]  I need rags in the bug shells.
[17102.61s -> 17111.78s]  Batteries.
[17111.78s -> 17120.27s]  Sell the antlers.
[17120.27s -> 17127.29s]  Bring the cable.
[17127.29s -> 17141.15s]  Eat it before I run away.
[17141.15s -> 17144.58s]  Lockpick. Don't need the tape.
[17144.58s -> 17147.58s]  Store the bottle.
[17147.58s -> 17151.21s]  Flashlight up here.
[17151.21s -> 17154.21s]  Molotov. Antlers. Get rid of them.
[17154.21s -> 17157.21s]  Watch. Battery. Shovel that is being depleted.
[17157.21s -> 17160.21s]  Torch. Don't need it. I have the light.
[17160.21s -> 17163.21s]  I got batteries. Eat that potato.
[17163.21s -> 17169.58s]  Cable. The axe needs an axe head
[17169.58s -> 17176.78s]  and a stick.
[17176.78s -> 17181.87s]  You sell an axe head and I know there's a stick outside.
[17181.87s -> 17187.66s]  210. I can't get this right now.
[17187.66s -> 17195.82s]  I'm going to bring the pitchfork and use it.
[17195.82s -> 17198.82s]  Shovel and if I have to I'll use it.
[17198.82s -> 17205.12s]  I don't need the toolbox anymore?
[17205.12s -> 17211.94s]  Is the toolbox useless?
[17211.94s -> 17223.76s]  Have I sold the toolbox you won't need it anymore? Really?
[17223.76s -> 17233.27s]  So this is useless to me?
[17233.27s -> 17238.99s]  I'll sell it if that's the case.
[17238.99s -> 17242.74s]  Upgrade workshop.
[17242.74s -> 17248.86s]  I need a pair of pliers and some wire.
[17248.86s -> 17255.30s]  I need to do the pliers before I can do the axe.
[17255.30s -> 17259.50s]  I just need scrap metal.
[17259.50s -> 17262.50s]  I can't craft it yet.
[17262.50s -> 17265.50s]  I don't need to do this yet.
[17265.50s -> 17268.50s]  I'm going to make one more lockpick.
[17268.50s -> 17272.51s]  I'm going to make a couple bandages.
[17272.51s -> 17277.99s]  I'll bring out these pills.
[17277.99s -> 17293.31s]  I don't have a reputation with this dude.
[17293.31s -> 17296.98s]  Right? Not bad.
[17296.98s -> 17307.49s]  Not a bad idea.
[17307.49s -> 17316.10s]  What are we doing?
[17316.10s -> 17320.50s]  I already have enough tape.
[17320.50s -> 17329.93s]  Let's get these rags and let's get a wire.
[17329.93s -> 17332.93s]  Now I need another wire.
[17332.93s -> 17345.38s]  I need both your wires because I want another lockpick.
[17345.38s -> 17349.33s]  I'm probably going to need it.
[17349.33s -> 17352.33s]  Three molotovs, which will go down here.
[17352.33s -> 17355.89s]  Can I only stack these in twos? Why?
[17355.89s -> 17359.90s]  Battery for the light? How do I use this?
[17359.90s -> 17368.58s]  Will it just automatically consume it from my inventory? Maybe.
[17368.58s -> 17372.20s]  Alright, I'm ready. Let's go try to do something with that.
[17372.20s -> 17375.20s]  I got the cable here. Let's do something with the pig.
[17375.20s -> 17381.19s]  Here we go. All the way to the left. Let's do it.
[17381.19s -> 17384.19s]  And then it's time to give the key to the wolf.
[17384.19s -> 17395.66s]  Let's go. Let's eat potato and run.
[17395.66s -> 17414.94s]  What a good use of the potato.
[17414.94s -> 17423.50s]  Walking through this stupid poison thing.
[17423.50s -> 17440.16s]  I'm just going to eat another one too. Cover more ground.
[17440.16s -> 17445.32s]  How do I like the game so far? I think it's great. It's very fun.
[17445.32s -> 17448.32s]  I've not decided that it was time to stop playing it.
[17448.32s -> 17451.75s]  Does anybody know?
[17451.75s -> 17454.75s]  I'm sure a lot of people here have already played this.
[17454.75s -> 17458.18s]  Hold on. I need to concentrate here.
[17458.18s -> 17461.68s]  How far am I in the game?
[17462.68s -> 17465.68s]  Oh, shit.
[17465.68s -> 17471.99s]  Everybody quiet. Everybody don't move.
[17481.47s -> 17497.35s]  That thing sucks.
[17497.35s -> 17500.35s]  Use gun? Not unless I'm absolutely necessary.
[17500.35s -> 17504.17s]  How much? One of my halfway.
[17504.17s -> 17517.95s]  That's cool. Here we are again.
[17517.95s -> 17524.97s]  Now I need to get back around and then I've got a cable now.
[17524.97s -> 17533.01s]  I'm a 2% Andy.
[17533.01s -> 17544.17s]  What?
[17544.17s -> 17555.01s]  I have to be ready for this.
[17555.01s -> 17562.41s]  I'm going to go up here and through this.
[17562.41s -> 17565.90s]  I'm still on the starting island?
[17565.90s -> 17568.90s]  Thanks for ruining the whole game for me.
[17568.90s -> 17578.03s]  Let me get this right.
[17578.03s -> 17607.88s]  I have the pitchfork still.
[17607.88s -> 17632.29s]  Get out of the way.
[17633.29s -> 17682.46s]  Got it. Eat?
[17682.46s -> 17737.90s]  What do I do with the cable?
[17737.90s -> 17740.90s]  How do I get out there?
[17740.90s -> 17745.16s]  How do I get to the cable?
[17745.16s -> 17774.30s]  I have to go all the way out and all the way around.
[17774.30s -> 17785.22s]  Eat another potato.
[17785.22s -> 17789.41s]  Still on the starting planet.
[17789.41s -> 17811.26s]  That is pretty funny.
[17811.26s -> 17814.26s]  Cut cables.
[17814.26s -> 17825.40s]  Hold on.
[17825.40s -> 17829.54s]  What the hell is in here?
[17829.54s -> 17846.46s]  Why do I have my Molotov cocktails out?
[17846.46s -> 17851.30s]  Lever. I need to turn the power on to use the lever.
[17851.30s -> 17860.54s]  That connects to that.
[17860.54s -> 17879.01s]  Search the chair.
[17879.01s -> 17883.08s]  Let's zap everything.
[17883.08s -> 17888.24s]  Let's electrify everybody.
[17888.24s -> 17907.72s]  Turn the power on.
[17907.72s -> 17937.06s]  Am I stuck in his head?
[17937.06s -> 17952.44s]  Let's turn it on.
[17952.44s -> 17956.26s]  It looks like a president.
[17956.26s -> 17961.93s]  Chill. It's just a game.
[17961.93s -> 17964.93s]  It's hard to chill when there's scary shit everywhere.
[17964.93s -> 17972.26s]  Some of them run through the door to the outside.
[17972.26s -> 17977.62s]  There's a lever and a red button on the panel.
[17977.62s -> 17980.62s]  The motion range of the lever is limited by a provisionally attached plate.
[17980.62s -> 17984.80s]  The node is glued to the casing.
[17984.80s -> 17987.80s]  The lock is set to a voltage that paralyzes the sow for a moment.
[17987.80s -> 17990.80s]  Around 15 seconds.
[17990.80s -> 17995.26s]  The lever operator positions it in the middle.
[17995.26s -> 17998.69s]  The feeder gives a sound signal.
[17998.69s -> 18001.69s]  The operator then pushes the button and the feeder feeds the sow.
[18001.69s -> 18004.69s]  Repeat until the feeding is complete.
[18004.69s -> 18008.06s]  Remember the sows are common good. Do not remove the lock.
[18008.06s -> 18020.38s]  So it paralyzes for 15 seconds.
[18020.38s -> 18030.86s]  Position the lever to the middle.
[18030.86s -> 18034.99s]  The lever is positioned in the middle.
[18034.99s -> 18040.47s]  Then I push the button.
[18040.47s -> 18043.47s]  It paralyzes for 15 seconds.
[18043.47s -> 18052.22s]  Should I kill it?
[18052.22s -> 18058.85s]  Then I feed the sow.
[18058.85s -> 18098.23s]  Then I have to run over there.
[18105.23s -> 18134.89s]  Come on.
[18134.89s -> 18137.89s]  I was just being tortured and shit.
[18137.89s -> 18149.45s]  What do you want me to do?
[18149.45s -> 18153.46s]  I just caused a famine.
[18153.46s -> 18168.90s]  Grow soybeans. Plant some corn on the ground.
[18168.90s -> 18171.90s]  Get some fresh lettuce.
[18171.90s -> 18198.55s]  You'll be fine.
[18198.55s -> 18202.05s]  It's time for my piggies to go to bed.
[18202.05s -> 18205.05s]  The great big mother piggy has said.
[18205.05s -> 18208.05s]  I will count them first to see if all my piggies come back to me.
[18208.05s -> 18211.05s]  One little piggy, two little piggies, three little piggies.
[18211.05s -> 18214.05s]  99 gg.
[18214.05s -> 18217.35s]  16 gg.
[18217.35s -> 18220.72s]  1699 is the password for the thing that's over there.
[18220.72s -> 18224.46s]  And I got a single shotgun.
[18224.46s -> 18227.46s]  Is there anything I can do with the pig?
[18227.46s -> 18244.90s]  I don't think there's anything else I can do here.
[18244.90s -> 18255.30s]  Battery's dead.
[18255.30s -> 18261.67s]  So now I'm going to do 1699.
[18263.94s -> 18266.94s]  On the thing that was locked over here, whatever it was.
[18266.94s -> 18274.53s]  I can reload on the flashlight.
[18274.53s -> 18281.46s]  Where was that thing?
[18281.46s -> 18287.44s]  Where was the 1699 thing?
[18287.44s -> 18292.71s]  It was down here, like a box or something over here.
[18292.71s -> 18301.52s]  Where was it?
[18301.52s -> 18329.43s]  I gotta go. It's late.
[18329.43s -> 18357.55s]  I'm going back. I'm going. Activate the super run.
[18357.55s -> 18361.18s]  Get out of the way.
[18361.18s -> 18377.52s]  Activate super frog.
[18377.52s -> 18387.14s]  I still have to go to the wolf too.
[18387.14s -> 18394.34s]  Bye.
[18394.34s -> 18419.51s]  Will you step in this so I can get free antlers?
[18419.51s -> 18424.03s]  I'm going home. I'm almost there.
[18424.03s -> 18437.18s]  I know it's past my bedtime. I'm going. I'm going to make it.
[18437.18s -> 18460.82s]  Another day. Let's make this quick.
[18460.82s -> 18466.04s]  I was supposed to get scrap metal.
[18466.04s -> 18473.49s]  And I didn't do it.
[18473.49s -> 18481.45s]  What's wrong with me?
[18481.45s -> 18484.45s]  This gun needs to...I'm going to have to put some stuff in a container.
[18484.45s -> 18487.45s]  Molotovs, pills, the...
[18487.45s -> 18495.73s]  Where's the other pitchfork? It's gone.
[18495.73s -> 18501.85s]  It's gone. I can't put the flares away either.
[18501.85s -> 18504.85s]  I have to start throwing shit in random boxes.
[18504.85s -> 18513.53s]  Don't sit at the table. I want the wardrobe.
[18513.53s -> 18527.63s]  No, keep those in...no.
[18527.63s -> 18530.63s]  Alright, alright. Pills, right?
[18530.63s -> 18534.64s]  Yes, I do. Pills...um...okay.
[18534.64s -> 18541.34s]  Good. Go.
[18541.34s -> 18549.82s]  I heard this treatment was funny. I'm disappointed. Minus two.
[18549.82s -> 18556.01s]  How did you know about minus two? If you just heard about me
[18556.01s -> 18562.18s]  and you came here for the first time, how would you know that?
[18562.18s -> 18567.83s]  Liar. Spot the liar!
[18567.83s -> 18571.97s]  Alright. These are still boarded.
[18571.97s -> 18575.91s]  I can't barricade this so people do...
[18575.91s -> 18592.14s]  I just have to wear the nails, wear the nails, wear the nails, nails.
[18592.14s -> 18612.58s]  This is almost done. I don't have any more traps left.
[18612.58s -> 18617.10s]  I should be okay. We're going with the...
[18617.10s -> 18624.18s]  I have the guns still.
[18624.18s -> 18627.55s]  I'm not going to need the flashlight. I'm going to put the pills here.
[18627.55s -> 18632.63s]  Or no. Yeah, that's fine.
[18632.63s -> 18638.11s]  Let's go, motherfuckers. What would I rate this game out of ten?
[18638.11s -> 18649.59s]  Three? Oh shit, heal.
[18649.59s -> 18657.81s]  I used the moth already. I have to just deal with it.
[18657.81s -> 18672.95s]  Zip your fly up. Oh shit, thanks.
[18672.95s -> 18678.62s]  Appreciate that. Thank you.
[18686.01s -> 18689.25s]  What door are they even in?
[18689.25s -> 18702.66s]  I think they're on the other side.
[18702.66s -> 18705.97s]  Bathing suits don't have flies.
[18705.97s -> 18715.59s]  I'm actually pretty uncomfortable. I'm not going to move.
[18715.59s -> 18721.65s]  Hey, why can't I see myself on your forehead? Don't yawn.
[18721.65s -> 18726.68s]  You can? Well, that's because
[18726.68s -> 18730.37s]  I've been playing a scary game and I've been sitting in front of the computer
[18730.37s -> 18733.54s]  for five hours and I've just peed.
[18733.54s -> 18736.78s]  So I'm sorry I haven't had time to be in the washroom
[18736.78s -> 18739.78s]  and like pat, pat, pat, pat, pat and like powder
[18739.78s -> 18742.78s]  in my face and put like cleanser on it and everything.
[18742.78s -> 18746.54s]  I'm playing Darkwood.
[18746.54s -> 18764.74s]  What the fuck? He can attack.
[18764.74s -> 18782.30s]  What's he doing?
[18782.30s -> 18785.30s]  He just got killed by a...
[18785.30s -> 18789.30s]  No!
[18789.30s -> 18798.72s]  He jumped in.
[18805.94s -> 18813.24s]  Give me the gun.
[18813.24s -> 18823.76s]  I can't see. I can't see.
[18823.76s -> 18828.28s]  Move. Why can't I move?
[18828.28s -> 18872.34s]  Oh, that sucked. Those big dogs die in one bullet.
[18872.34s -> 18878.89s]  That's really good to know.
[18878.89s -> 18886.48s]  Reload the gun? No, I don't want to waste a clip.
[18886.48s -> 18894.71s]  I think this is one of those games where when you reload, it just...
[18894.71s -> 18902.08s]  Come on in. Let's go.
[18902.08s -> 18942.17s]  Get out! When I missed him with the first swing and then he like went around
[18942.17s -> 18945.17s]  and I swung this way somehow
[18945.17s -> 18951.10s]  because he wrapped around me.
[18951.10s -> 18957.41s]  Kim probably thinks it's a home intruder here.
[18957.41s -> 18961.74s]  Get out of my room!
[18961.74s -> 18971.70s]  Like I'm being injured.
[18971.70s -> 18978.18s]  Okay, I can do the meat. Please.
[18978.18s -> 18984.37s]  794. I need to...
[18984.37s -> 19004.81s]  I need to steal. Let's go.
[19004.81s -> 19015.07s]  6. Let's go.
[19015.07s -> 19024.06s]  Go open 16GG.
[19024.06s -> 19036.13s]  Give me more magazines? You do. Give me one.
[19036.13s -> 19051.32s]  Let's go. I'm out. Wait. I'm out.
[19051.32s -> 19055.01s]  Let's do it. Wait. Yes, I'm fine.
[19055.01s -> 19062.33s]  I'm going to have to seldomly use this weapon.
[19062.33s -> 19086.74s]  Nice gamer slouch. Thanks, man.
[19086.74s -> 19097.51s]  Scrap! It'll have to do. I have a gun.
[19097.51s -> 19105.81s]  My whole body is itchy.
[19105.81s -> 19111.74s]  You want meat? I didn't get it though, did I?
[19111.74s -> 19128.02s]  I killed the pig. Where the hell are you?
[19128.02s -> 19132.79s]  He stops playing low as his head.
[19132.79s -> 19136.42s]  Show item. No. Gossip.
[19136.42s -> 19139.42s]  I saw the villagers dragging a cart with a dead sow,
[19139.42s -> 19142.42s]  the one they called the mother of all pigs.
[19142.42s -> 19145.66s]  It wasn't as beautiful as they said, nowhere near the pretty lady.
[19145.66s -> 19148.96s]  And that piggy, it was a bit similar to me.
[19148.96s -> 19151.96s]  The boy sniffles and rubs the mask with his deformed hand.
[19151.96s -> 19154.96s]  I've been crying after her a lot.
[19154.96s -> 19157.96s]  I saw them trying to cut through the wall of trees.
[19157.96s -> 19160.96s]  Do you think it's even possible, sir?
[19160.96s -> 19163.96s]  Mommy told me once that the woods are never ending.
[19163.96s -> 19183.12s]  And there's nothing on the other side.
[19183.12s -> 19186.12s]  What's the grand plan?
[19186.12s -> 19189.12s]  I don't know. That pig did not look well.
[19189.12s -> 19195.18s]  It was really awful, actually.
[19195.18s -> 19198.18s]  I'm going to put the eggs up here in place of the shovel for now.
[19198.18s -> 19216.46s]  I'm just running. Eat.
[19216.46s -> 19222.70s]  Eat. All right, keep going.
[19222.70s -> 19225.70s]  Almost there, wolf man.
[19225.70s -> 19229.58s]  And the pig place.
[19229.58s -> 19233.34s]  I need to find that. I need to find out what's going on in the cellar.
[19233.34s -> 19244.94s]  It was like a panther. What the hell was that?
[19244.94s -> 19256.49s]  Okay. That was a nice reference to a show.
[19256.49s -> 19260.11s]  I mean, a little bit, maybe. All right, let's get in here.
[19260.11s -> 19266.17s]  Where is this?
[19266.17s -> 19272.08s]  It was like over here.
[19272.08s -> 19276.54s]  Well, they took the pig out, right?
[19276.54s -> 19283.87s]  It's in here.
[19283.87s -> 19288.78s]  No. What? Where is it?
[19288.78s -> 19312.61s]  Where the hell is this thing? Oh, it's in the town.
[19312.61s -> 19317.37s]  There's a workbench in here.
[19317.37s -> 19325.22s]  Wait a minute. Is there an oven in here?
[19325.22s -> 19336.39s]  It's that door right there. That's the one. No.
[19336.39s -> 19345.14s]  Where's the oven? Is there an oven? This looks like a hideout.
[19345.14s -> 19357.06s]  I don't know. I guess I could turn the generator on, but there's no gas.
[19357.06s -> 19360.06s]  I guess there is.
[19360.06s -> 19366.94s]  I don't know. Let's go to where the pig was.
[19366.94s -> 19384.11s]  Go to the wolf man. Well, they took the giant pig out of here.
[19384.11s -> 19387.11s]  I kind of want to see what's in the spot that it was in.
[19390.93s -> 19407.21s]  What the fuck? Oh, egg. I'm going to shoot him.
[19407.21s -> 19416.83s]  I'm going to shoot him.
[19416.83s -> 19443.46s]  Why did I take the melee weapon off the bar?
[19443.46s -> 19446.46s]  Well, it's because I was just going to run
[19446.46s -> 19451.48s]  and just eat the eggs as I ran.
[19451.48s -> 19462.08s]  The guy on the cover art is dead.
[19462.08s -> 19465.96s]  That's what was on the cover art? Interesting.
[19465.96s -> 19476.75s]  What is in here?
[19476.75s -> 19479.99s]  Oh, the pigs are dead. No, they're not. They're all alive, actually.
[19479.99s -> 19485.98s]  So they took the pig out.
[19485.98s -> 19492.02s]  What's here instead?
[19492.02s -> 19496.22s]  Oh, come on. There's no item here.
[19496.22s -> 19499.22s]  Really? That sucks.
[19499.22s -> 19511.36s]  I really thought there's going to be something in here.
[19511.36s -> 19529.06s]  Check the generator room. Yeah, I will.
[19529.06s -> 19534.29s]  I'm going to go all the way out for that.
[19534.29s -> 19558.46s]  I'm going to go all the way out, all the way around to go to the generator room.
[19558.46s -> 19568.72s]  I don't need to eat that yet. Okay.
[19568.72s -> 19572.09s]  Through here, right? All right.
[19572.09s -> 19580.75s]  Is there anything else in here? Is the lever?
[19580.75s -> 19584.06s]  Dead villager? No, you didn't have anything on you?
[19584.06s -> 19588.18s]  Lamp. Talk to the mirror.
[19588.18s -> 19594.92s]  All right, you kind of losing it.
[19594.92s -> 19597.92s]  You are one ugly bastard.
[19597.92s -> 19618.49s]  I guess you got what you deserved.
[19618.49s -> 19623.01s]  Yeah, whatever. Stick it up your ass, Humpty Dumpty.
[19623.01s -> 19628.22s]  Right here. Right here.
[19628.22s -> 19662.43s]  What am I doing?
[19662.43s -> 19671.10s]  Wolf, please don't tell me I have to go all the way around.
[19671.10s -> 19674.10s]  Please don't tell me I have to go all the way around.
[19674.10s -> 19690.63s]  Peasant here looking good today? Thanks.
[19690.63s -> 19695.33s]  We are almost there. Top right.
[19695.33s -> 19699.66s]  So Key is going to go to the wolf.
[19699.66s -> 19702.66s]  And hopefully I get a reward.
[19705.83s -> 19708.83s]  This is... You guys cool?
[19708.83s -> 19718.34s]  You guys know each other?
[19718.34s -> 19732.53s]  16GG. You guys fucking know each other or what?
[19732.53s -> 19747.46s]  I didn't do anything.
[19748.46s -> 19767.64s]  Yes, show item.
[19767.64s -> 19770.64s]  Here is the key covered in chicken feces.
[19770.64s -> 19776.06s]  As I produce the key, the wolf's pupils widen with excitement.
[19776.06s -> 19779.81s]  As I produce the key, the wolf's pupils widen with excitement.
[19779.81s -> 19783.18s]  Well, mate, I didn't think you could succeed.
[19783.18s -> 19786.18s]  I'm impressed. Time for your reward.
[19786.18s -> 19789.67s]  You'll find that quick thief here.
[19789.67s -> 19792.67s]  You'll find that quack thief here.
[19792.67s -> 19795.67s]  Buddy locked himself away from the world and he won't let anybody in.
[19795.67s -> 19798.67s]  This information will be of any use to you, meaty.
[19798.67s -> 19801.67s]  What the fuck are you looking at? I promised that I'd tell you where to find him.
[19801.67s -> 19804.67s]  And I did.
[19804.67s -> 19807.67s]  Did I tell you you'll be able to get there? That's something else, isn't it?
[19807.67s -> 19811.55s]  He laughs.
[19811.55s -> 19814.55s]  Now get out of my sight, meat. I have important business to attend to.
[19814.55s -> 19817.55s]  If you're interested in continuing our wonderful relationship, look for me in the northeastern edge of the old woods.
[19817.55s -> 19820.55s]  I predict a tasty future together.
[19820.55s -> 19823.55s]  Sinks his hands into the deep pockets of his coat.
[19823.55s -> 19826.55s]  Could you deliver this to that insane old bitch as a way of thank you for her beautiful sister?
[19826.55s -> 19838.24s]  The wolf throws the head of a chicken under my feet.
[19838.24s -> 19841.24s]  As I lift my gaze, I realize the wolf is gone.
[19841.24s -> 19860.16s]  What are these codes?
[19860.16s -> 19865.77s]  What are the codes? You have these two codes, these crates here with codes on them.
[19865.77s -> 19876.82s]  Those are backer rewards.
[19876.82s -> 19886.14s]  Oh, okay.
[19886.14s -> 19905.55s]  Well, I gotta go this way.
[19905.55s -> 19908.55s]  Go back and give this to the old bitch.
[19908.55s -> 19912.18s]  Apparently is what he said.
[19912.18s -> 19919.13s]  I'm going to go back and talk to the old lady.
[19919.13s -> 19923.65s]  15 o'clock. Yep. I gotta go.
[19923.65s -> 19928.17s]  I want those crates.
[19928.17s -> 19936.59s]  Can I retroactively contribute to the Kickstarter?
[19936.59s -> 19960.87s]  What the fuck is happening? I'm going to die out here.
[19960.87s -> 19965.01s]  Scrap. Get me the fuck out of these woods.
[19965.01s -> 19968.01s]  Why does it have to go all the way up and around?
[19968.01s -> 19971.63s]  This is unnatural walling that you're doing.
[19971.63s -> 19974.63s]  This is the only place to go here.
[19974.63s -> 19977.63s]  This is unnatural walling, and it's preventing me from playing the game.
[19977.63s -> 19986.76s]  I have to take this thing.
[19986.76s -> 19993.52s]  What the hell am I? I gotta go down and then right.
[19993.52s -> 20048.01s]  Blood. Oh, that's why.
[20048.01s -> 20057.18s]  Fuckers, I need to get out of here.
[20057.18s -> 20070.86s]  Tab four!
[20070.86s -> 20082.27s]  I had to shoot him.
[20082.27s -> 20085.27s]  Hold on, guys. Let me hit tab.
[20085.27s -> 20100.02s]  Tab. It takes like four and a half seconds.
[20100.02s -> 20125.32s]  What the hell even is?
[20125.32s -> 20128.75s]  It's right there. I got time. Just go get it.
[20128.75s -> 20131.75s]  I will shoot a motherfucker if they come near me.
[20131.75s -> 20148.24s]  Stop hitting.
[20148.24s -> 20152.50s]  I'm switching them. Tab is map.
[20152.50s -> 20165.02s]  M is inventory.
[20165.02s -> 20169.80s]  Just give me my inventory. It's right here.
[20169.80s -> 20172.80s]  I just hit M to look at the map.
[20172.80s -> 20175.80s]  It's right here. Get off.
[20175.80s -> 20185.82s]  Give me my stuff.
[20185.82s -> 20194.87s]  I need audio. Why is this taking so long?
[20194.87s -> 20205.09s]  Where's my stuff?
[20205.09s -> 20208.09s]  Where's my stuff?
[20208.09s -> 20215.04s]  Where's my bag of stuff?
[20215.04s -> 20222.23s]  Shit.
[20222.23s -> 20225.23s]  Actual shit. Not good.
[20225.23s -> 20228.23s]  Actually shit.
[20228.23s -> 20241.18s]  Oh shit.
[20241.18s -> 20258.31s]  I just hit M.
[20258.31s -> 20273.82s]  I'm furious.
[20273.82s -> 20285.83s]  I had it on me too. I'm fucking mad as hell.
[20285.83s -> 20300.51s]  Let me in the door. What?
[20300.51s -> 20306.57s]  That takes you forever to do anything.
[20306.57s -> 20314.42s]  I could be over that in a second. Way quicker than that.
[20314.42s -> 20319.77s]  Wood. I need wood and nails.
[20319.77s -> 20324.40s]  Where the fuck are they?
[20324.40s -> 20337.67s]  I had like a thousand of them. I don't have anymore.
[20337.67s -> 20340.67s]  I'm going to actually get mad and fucking smash this keyboard into the wall.
[20340.67s -> 20343.67s]  I'm going to just resby it.
[20343.67s -> 20363.79s]  Do it.
[20363.79s -> 20370.74s]  This guy's made it a quicksand.
[20370.74s -> 20396.50s]  I've been doing drugs all day and I can't speed it up.
[20396.50s -> 20421.03s]  I'm using the gun. It's a failed experiment.
[20421.03s -> 20426.64s]  I'm going to use the gun. Check the gas. Uh oh.
[20426.64s -> 20452.47s]  Is that going to last?
[20452.47s -> 20457.38s]  What are you talking about? The flash was off.
[20457.38s -> 20482.04s]  He's so mad.
[20482.04s -> 20485.04s]  I wish I could make boots to not step on the poison.
[20485.04s -> 20494.30s]  It's hard to see. It's embedded into the ground.
[20494.30s -> 20497.30s]  I'm going to step in a bear trap. Who's putting the bear traps out there?
[20497.30s -> 20506.74s]  Turn the lights off in your room for maximum immersion.
[20506.74s -> 20510.88s]  Don't look at it, right? I don't know where it is.
[20510.88s -> 20527.30s]  This isn't the gas, is it?
[20527.30s -> 20535.01s]  Thank God nobody's showed up yet.
[20535.01s -> 20540.42s]  No, I'm not turning my lights off. Not right now.
[20540.42s -> 20563.87s]  Why did I shoot the gun?
[20563.87s -> 20566.87s]  It was moving around. It looked like it was going to explode, so I don't know. I had to shoot it.
[20566.87s -> 20582.78s]  Almost there.
[20582.78s -> 20586.98s]  I can make the light armor. No, I need scrap metal.
[20586.98s -> 20589.98s]  Dude, I don't even know where to get scrap metal. I have to buy it from the vendors.
[20589.98s -> 20603.83s]  I've got plenty of gas.
[20603.83s -> 20616.02s]  Thank goodness.
[20616.02s -> 20619.02s]  All it was was a bug. One beetle attacked my house today.
[20619.02s -> 20630.88s]  I'm okay with that.
[20630.88s -> 20633.88s]  Did I loot the insect? Yeah, I did.
[20633.88s -> 20647.42s]  I got the shell.
[20647.42s -> 20651.48s]  150 rep.
[20651.48s -> 20670.26s]  Let's get the hell out of here.
[20670.26s -> 20673.26s]  I'm going to dismantle the window.
[20673.26s -> 20677.39s]  I want scrap from you. All of it.
[20677.39s -> 20690.30s]  I will do that.
[20690.30s -> 20693.30s]  Now I need to repair the shovel.
[20693.30s -> 20697.62s]  I also need to...
[20697.62s -> 20706.29s]  I need two rags.
[20706.29s -> 20724.50s]  I don't have one rag.
[20724.50s -> 20730.11s]  Cool. How do I put it on?
[20730.11s -> 20749.58s]  You are wearing armor. It's that simple.
[20749.58s -> 20752.58s]  I'm good to go. Get rid of the shiny stone.
[20752.58s -> 20755.58s]  Keep the pills. Get rid of these containers.
[20755.58s -> 20762.13s]  Keep the lock picks.
[20762.13s -> 20768.81s]  You got anything else for me?
[20768.81s -> 20773.84s]  I'm going to refill the generator.
[20773.84s -> 20776.84s]  I'm going to forget.
[20776.84s -> 20784.82s]  That's a guarantee.
[20784.82s -> 20788.06s]  What are we going to do?
[20788.06s -> 20792.06s]  We are going to probably go back to the village and talk to the old lady.
[20792.06s -> 20799.91s]  Give her the chicken head.
[20799.91s -> 20804.62s]  Let's complete that quest line.
[20804.62s -> 20809.59s]  How do you beat this game?
[20809.59s -> 20813.15s]  You have to leave with a special key that I don't have.
[20813.15s -> 20816.15s]  You get a key and you can leave.
[20816.15s -> 20823.02s]  I think that's what happens.
[20823.02s -> 20826.33s]  I think I'm good to go.
[20826.33s -> 20830.08s]  I have my pills. Got a gun. My flashlight.
[20830.08s -> 20833.96s]  I'm going to replace the flashlight.
[20833.96s -> 20838.93s]  I need another slot.
[20838.93s -> 20848.17s]  Let's go to the village.
[20848.17s -> 20853.90s]  I have no idea how this is going to happen.
[20853.90s -> 20857.85s]  The village is on fire.
[20857.85s -> 20865.94s]  That's the pig.
[20865.94s -> 20880.81s]  This place is kind of in shambles.
[20880.81s -> 20885.84s]  It's your fault.
[20885.84s -> 20924.92s]  Old lady.
[20924.92s -> 20928.42s]  That's probably something to do there.
[20928.42s -> 20931.85s]  I'm going to end up killing that thing.
[20931.85s -> 20943.52s]  You're a boomer.
[20943.52s -> 20947.53s]  Just hit it with a stick.
[20947.53s -> 20954.02s]  Where's the old lady's house?
[20954.02s -> 20959.18s]  Who's this?
[20959.18s -> 20965.41s]  Is that the doctor? No?
[20965.41s -> 20969.14s]  Everyone's getting sick.
[20969.14s -> 20974.30s]  We're never going to make it.
[20974.30s -> 20988.02s]  These woods have no end.
[20988.02s -> 20996.03s]  We'll just starve here.
[20996.03s -> 20999.59s]  My hands are killing me.
[20999.59s -> 21007.73s]  It's your turn now.
[21007.73s -> 21014.49s]  He's deaf all of a sudden.
[21014.49s -> 21017.49s]  He has an axe.
[21017.49s -> 21020.98s]  He has an axe.
[21020.98s -> 21028.00s]  He'll drop this, right?
[21028.00s -> 21035.53s]  He has a better weapon than me.
[21035.53s -> 21048.91s]  He'll probably turn in one shot.
[21048.91s -> 21053.99s]  I have a gun.
[21053.99s -> 21062.22s]  Why would I use this when I have a gun?
[21062.22s -> 21093.82s]  I want that axe. If he drops the axe, I'm doing it.
[21093.82s -> 21102.74s]  That's 450 bucks that I don't have to spend.
[21102.74s -> 21105.74s]  I'm meeting people in this village.
[21105.74s -> 21121.20s]  We're all so innocent.
[21121.20s -> 21125.70s]  Where's the witch's house?
[21125.70s -> 21133.74s]  Is it blocked off now or am I going the wrong way?
[21133.74s -> 21136.74s]  I shot a guy who's eaten probably five people.
[21136.74s -> 21150.10s]  To take his axe.
[21150.10s -> 21178.90s]  Wasn't there something down here?
[21178.90s -> 21184.64s]  Didn't this guy have a box that I couldn't open?
[21184.64s -> 21193.37s]  No. Where am I thinking that was?
[21194.37s -> 21210.82s]  I thought he did. Where is it?
[21210.82s -> 21213.82s]  I've already searched all these. There's not one in here.
[21213.82s -> 21224.71s]  I don't know. I need a key.
[21224.71s -> 21228.72s]  Inside the house.
[21228.72s -> 21231.72s]  The door is locked from the outside and it's locked from the inside.
[21231.72s -> 21240.02s]  Why do you have to block me off?
[21240.02s -> 21243.02s]  I just want to go that way.
[21243.02s -> 21301.39s]  What? Quit eating people.
[21301.39s -> 21306.36s]  Killing people. What are you talking about?
[21306.36s -> 21309.36s]  Zero. I've had zero people for breakfast.
[21309.36s -> 21322.78s]  Why have you forsaken us?
[21322.78s -> 21329.92s]  I'm taking the jewel too. No I'm not.
[21329.92s -> 21336.79s]  What have we done to have wronged you?
[21336.79s -> 21340.03s]  They're eating the pigs.
[21340.03s -> 21343.03s]  I thought they were eating people. And the pig.
[21343.03s -> 21348.64s]  I thought it was double food source.
[21348.64s -> 21360.33s]  One guy was eating people.
[21360.33s -> 21378.46s]  They feed people. It's all fucked up.
[21378.46s -> 21390.09s]  Let's go in here.
[21390.09s -> 21394.22s]  No witnesses. That's not how this works.
[21394.22s -> 21398.81s]  This is not even the right house.
[21398.81s -> 21404.10s]  I wish I had a map of this place.
[21404.10s -> 21409.45s]  This is her secret house with the key in it.
[21409.45s -> 21422.91s]  I wish I had a map. It helps to have a map.
[21422.91s -> 21425.91s]  I know. And I wish I had one. But time is frozen.
[21425.91s -> 21437.39s]  Is it over here?
[21437.39s -> 21444.41s]  This is a box on the ground. That's the doll.
[21447.41s -> 21456.66s]  Northeast.
[21456.66s -> 21468.46s]  All the way to the left. That's where I'm going now.
[21468.46s -> 21471.46s]  It's a chest. I'm not going to kill the mayor.
[21471.46s -> 21482.77s]  I'm not going to kill the mayor.
[21482.77s -> 21488.25s]  This is not it, right?
[21488.25s -> 21496.02s]  Where is this old motherfucker's house?
[21496.02s -> 21500.15s]  Up. Every house is just the same house.
[21500.15s -> 21511.65s]  It's a square.
[21511.65s -> 21517.96s]  Why can't I get a map for this stupid village?
[21517.96s -> 21520.96s]  I can't get a map of the silent forest, but I can't get a map of the village
[21520.96s -> 21526.12s]  with people in it that live here?
[21526.12s -> 21532.43s]  Nobody drew a map of this place?
[21532.43s -> 21552.38s]  I'll take some rope.
[21552.38s -> 21564.43s]  And I'll take the photo.
[21564.43s -> 21568.49s]  There it is. Shotgun. Memories.
[21568.49s -> 21578.62s]  Now that I have that,
[21578.62s -> 21582.12s]  I want to go to the old lady's house.
[21582.12s -> 21585.42s]  In this gigantic Disneyland maze.
[21585.42s -> 21588.86s]  That wasn't me. That was in the game.
[21588.86s -> 21598.86s]  Now I'll go right. Go left.
[21598.86s -> 21602.74s]  It's that house right there.
[21602.74s -> 21606.82s]  No, it's not. It's not this one.
[21606.82s -> 21612.92s]  Because it's the one with the broom down here.
[21612.92s -> 21616.42s]  I'm going to scream into the mic.
[21616.42s -> 21621.51s]  Who is this? Oh, that's the person that I shot.
[21621.51s -> 21624.82s]  Go left? I can't go left. This is an unnatural wall.
[21624.82s -> 21650.25s]  There is no left.
[21650.25s -> 21653.49s]  Wasn't she to the right?
[21653.49s -> 21666.26s]  This is the house with the person that's lying on the ground here.
[21666.26s -> 21671.17s]  She's to the right. She's actually to the right.
[21671.17s -> 21674.41s]  There's nothing over here left. The person lying down on the ground over there is left.
[21674.41s -> 21679.17s]  There's the well. Might as well kill that person too.
[21679.17s -> 21682.73s]  No. Okay.
[21682.73s -> 21688.14s]  This is the hole to go back to the house.
[21688.14s -> 21692.60s]  They're burning the pig over here.
[21692.60s -> 21697.70s]  Up here is the guy that's eating people.
[21697.70s -> 21712.97s]  That shit fucked me up. That's the problem.
[21712.97s -> 21715.97s]  That was the problem right there, guys.
[21715.97s -> 21720.04s]  That's the issue. I would have found this like 13 minutes ago.
[21720.04s -> 21723.04s]  Do you understand?
[21723.04s -> 21726.04s]  The burning pig surrounded by burnt trees.
[21726.04s -> 21735.36s]  It kept me out.
[21735.36s -> 21741.46s]  Look. You don't even need to tell you.
[21741.46s -> 21749.23s]  Hey. Look at this. Just give me a fucking map.
[21749.23s -> 21753.82s]  Lost in the Disneyland parking lot. Yes.
[21753.82s -> 21756.82s]  Except for everything else in the whole game.
[21756.82s -> 21759.82s]  Except for the one place that requires one to see points of interest on it.
[21759.82s -> 21767.78s]  Did you see the chicken head yet?
[21767.78s -> 21770.78s]  Mister, have mercy upon me and find her.
[21770.78s -> 21775.23s]  Mother Mary, I don't know what I'm going to do without her. I'll buy myself.
[21775.23s -> 21780.90s]  He parked in the Donald Duck section.
[21780.90s -> 21783.90s]  Yeah, that shit sucks because it's like Donald Duck A2.
[21783.90s -> 21786.90s]  Donald Duck A1. Donald Duck A.
[21786.90s -> 21790.59s]  And it goes from A all the way to like F.
[21790.59s -> 21793.59s]  I don't know. I think I've hit Goofy F6.
[21793.59s -> 21799.90s]  The McDonald Duck B622.
[21799.90s -> 21804.68s]  What do you want me to do?
[21804.68s -> 21811.12s]  Your mother is your mother. Oh, the pig, right.
[21811.12s -> 21816.39s]  Okay. Let's gossip for a second.
[21816.39s -> 21819.39s]  We already saw this.
[21819.39s -> 21829.59s]  Show item.
[21829.59s -> 21832.59s]  Jesus Almighty, my little darling, what have they done to you?
[21832.59s -> 21835.59s]  This is a bad sign. Mister, a bad sign. What will happen now?
[21835.59s -> 21865.12s]  Military flashlight.
[21865.12s -> 21868.62s]  A rag and pills.
[21868.62s -> 21876.34s]  A sheet and a few pairs of worn trousers.
[21876.34s -> 21879.34s]  Well, you ain't here anymore. Sheets.
[21879.34s -> 21882.34s]  A pile of crumbled pillows and pillowcases. Looks like someone has slept here.
[21882.34s -> 21893.18s]  A wedding ring. Thank you.
[21893.18s -> 21899.92s]  Okay. Nice.
[21899.92s -> 21910.76s]  Okay.
[21910.76s -> 21913.76s]  I wish I could find a fat little bug upon seeing you.
[21913.76s -> 21919.30s]  All right. Well, I think I did that.
[21919.30s -> 21924.14s]  I've got the shotgun.
[21924.14s -> 21927.14s]  Pig is gone.
[21927.14s -> 21932.56s]  And now I have the new area up top to go up to.
[21932.56s -> 21935.56s]  Kill her. Why would you write that?
[21935.56s -> 21938.99s]  Why would you write that? Why would you write Banana Cream Pie?
[21938.99s -> 21942.74s]  Completely without any reason to write it.
[21942.74s -> 21952.64s]  You just wrote it and I've read it. Why would you write that?
[21952.64s -> 21955.64s]  Why would you do this to me? You're a coward.
[21955.64s -> 21961.76s]  You know I'm on a diet right now. See, this shit fucked me all up.
[21961.76s -> 21964.76s]  Because I couldn't go around it. I can't come over here.
[21964.76s -> 21967.76s]  I come over here, right? I typically knew the witch was over on the right.
[21967.76s -> 21970.76s]  All right. Here we are. I just got out. Oh, this is about...
[21970.76s -> 21973.76s]  This fucking giant pig here. Oh, shit.
[21973.76s -> 21976.76s]  This is just here now. I can't go around this.
[21976.76s -> 21979.76s]  There's like a bunch of stuff here. Where's that witch?
[21979.76s -> 21982.76s]  And then I went down this way. I thought I had to go that way.
[21982.76s -> 21985.76s]  That's my explanation. If you don't like that, then...
[21986.76s -> 21993.82s]  Blame the unnatural walling that goes down in a straight line past the pig.
[21993.82s -> 22001.92s]  Why can't I just walk right over here? All right, I'm done.
[22001.92s -> 22009.90s]  Where am I going? Homemade shotgun.
[22009.90s -> 22012.90s]  I don't have any... How many shells do I have?
[22012.90s -> 22020.47s]  The mayor. The mayor, right.
[22020.47s -> 22033.10s]  Where's the mayor's house? It says useless after...
[22033.10s -> 22038.58s]  So I can shoot that one time. Buffalo chicken pizza.
[22038.58s -> 22042.59s]  You guys are cruel. You guys are cruel.
[22042.59s -> 22046.22s]  Garlic bread. I can't eat that either. I can eat lettuce.
[22046.22s -> 22050.53s]  Lettuce. Crab meat.
[22050.53s -> 22054.34s]  Turkey patties. Plain without seasoning.
[22054.34s -> 22062.00s]  Some vegetables. Dammit. All right.
[22062.00s -> 22066.01s]  Where's this guy's house? Mayor's house.
[22066.01s -> 22072.11s]  Not over here. All right.
[22072.11s -> 22075.11s]  From where I'm standing right now, where should I go to the mayor's house?
[22075.11s -> 22090.37s]  Up. Perfectly cooked and seasoned sirloin steak.
[22090.37s -> 22095.37s]  See, unfortunately for you, I don't really like steak.
[22095.37s -> 22099.70s]  So that doesn't really do it for me.
[22099.70s -> 22107.34s]  Let's buy that bridge. Not this way.
[22107.34s -> 22122.59s]  Mayor. No, I don't like...
[22122.59s -> 22125.59s]  I don't really like steak. I just don't.
[22125.59s -> 22128.59s]  I like... Red meat is great.
[22128.59s -> 22133.22s]  I think I like hamburgers. I like corned beef.
[22133.22s -> 22136.85s]  I'm a huge pastrami fan.
[22136.85s -> 22139.85s]  Pastrami is seriously one of my favorite...
[22139.85s -> 22147.17s]  kind of go to the deli.
[22147.17s -> 22150.17s]  Get away from me. What are you talking about? What's wrong with you?
[22150.17s -> 22153.47s]  Are you the mayor? Where's the mayor?
[22153.47s -> 22169.11s]  Just checking it out.
[22169.11s -> 22172.11s]  Sliced or shaved. Shaved pastrami.
[22172.11s -> 22183.72s]  I need to stop talking about this.
[22183.72s -> 22192.00s]  Where do I just go? With cheese. Yeah.
[22192.00s -> 22196.65s]  With a slice of Swiss cheese on it. Maybe a little bit of mustard.
[22196.65s -> 22202.94s]  For sure. It's good stuff.
[22202.94s -> 22205.94s]  Okay. So here is a house.
[22205.94s -> 22208.94s]  This is not the mayor's house. It's just a house over here.
[22208.94s -> 22212.89s]  South of bridge then immediate left.
[22212.89s -> 22247.60s]  The mayor house is a house with a generator.
[22247.60s -> 22254.81s]  This is the only structure that's over here.
[22254.81s -> 22278.00s]  This is the only structure that's over here. Is it this one right here?
[22278.00s -> 22290.50s]  Where's the mayor? The mayor wants to see you.
[22290.50s -> 22312.03s]  I don't know what house he lives in. By the way, he's in the cellar.
[22312.03s -> 22315.03s]  Oh, I shot the guy immediately. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's right.
[22315.03s -> 22318.45s]  He would have told me. I shot him the second
[22318.45s -> 22321.45s]  he said go to the mayor's house.
[22321.45s -> 22324.45s]  I don't know where the mayor's house is,
[22324.45s -> 22327.45s]  but the guy that was going to give me the information,
[22327.45s -> 22330.45s]  I killed him immediately.
[22330.45s -> 22334.50s]  I need to apologize for this.
[22334.50s -> 22337.50s]  Because people would have told me what to do. Probably, right?
[22337.50s -> 22343.30s]  I have to say sorry about that one.
[22343.30s -> 22349.73s]  Hey mayor, let's make some legislature.
[22349.73s -> 22352.73s]  Give me plus two, plus two. Please, please God, please, please God, please God.
[22352.73s -> 22379.42s]  Alright, where is he? Come here for a second.
[22379.42s -> 22384.26s]  It's him. He's the one who killed our sow. Unleash!
[22384.26s -> 22406.62s]  Antec!
[22406.62s -> 22418.87s]  Which one of you is the mayor?
[22418.87s -> 22421.87s]  Antec was pretty bad.
[22421.87s -> 22424.87s]  I was thinking it was going to be bigger.
[22424.87s -> 22438.40s]  It was just a guy with a headcrab on his head.
[22438.40s -> 22442.02s]  Was this the mayor? Oh, shit.
[22442.02s -> 22454.74s]  Oh, you're going to find out what you fucking cellar, mate.
[22454.74s -> 22460.44s]  Oh, this is bad. All this stuff is important.
[22460.44s -> 22470.75s]  The rope. The nails. The wood.
[22470.75s -> 22482.89s]  The dead meat is useless. Who cares?
[22482.89s -> 22485.89s]  I have nothing else on these guys. I'm just a pitchfork I don't want.
[22485.89s -> 22490.47s]  Odd meat and another wire.
[22490.47s -> 22494.61s]  Damn it. I can make some toothpicks that open doors.
[22494.61s -> 22502.71s]  Give me some room.
[22502.71s -> 22511.07s]  Yes, good.
[22511.07s -> 22534.09s]  Oh mayor, where are you?
[22534.09s -> 22537.71s]  I think I killed the mayor.
[22537.71s -> 22541.85s]  I'm mad that I killed that person.
[22541.85s -> 22545.41s]  I preliminarily eliminated another enemy.
[22545.41s -> 22559.00s]  Why can I not leave?
[22559.00s -> 22563.20s]  It's good to go. Nice.
[22563.20s -> 22572.26s]  I'm done with this town. You searched the villager on accident and not the chomper.
[22572.26s -> 22600.96s]  What?
[22600.96s -> 22606.17s]  Alright, so this village is done. Did what I can here.
[22606.17s -> 22609.54s]  Leave the potato. I don't care. I got a lot of shit now.
[22609.54s -> 22612.54s]  I got a military flashlight.
[22612.54s -> 22617.17s]  Go back and then...
[22617.17s -> 22621.56s]  What time is it? You searched the chomper on accident.
[22621.56s -> 22630.35s]  Alright, now I know where to go.
[22630.35s -> 22633.35s]  You have the whole city. The city is yours.
[22633.35s -> 22640.03s]  There's the well and now...
[22640.03s -> 22643.03s]  This way. See? I got here immediately.
[22643.03s -> 22649.90s]  So, what do you think we're doing tomorrow?
[22649.90s -> 22674.10s]  Now this, I have...
[22674.10s -> 22677.10s]  Why is there blood everywhere? Why is there a bunch of pig heads in here?
[22677.10s -> 22684.87s]  Why? They know where I live?
[22684.87s -> 22689.20s]  It's kind of creepy.
[22689.20s -> 22692.63s]  So, I have like six or seven horror games that I'm going to play.
[22692.63s -> 22696.37s]  Over the next few weeks.
[22696.37s -> 22702.23s]  I kind of want to see this through.
[22702.23s -> 22705.23s]  Do you think whoever has played this game that I could beat this game
[22705.23s -> 22708.47s]  in another six to seven hours?
[22708.47s -> 22717.92s]  Maybe. No. Absolutely. Definitely. No.
[22717.92s -> 22723.00s]  Almost.
[22723.00s -> 22729.04s]  Absolutely not. Okay. Well.
[22729.04s -> 22738.92s]  Maybe. I didn't get anything down there.
[22738.92s -> 22747.58s]  Rope. I have this axe head.
[22747.58s -> 22750.58s]  These have to go. I'm not going to ever use them.
[22750.58s -> 22753.58s]  The three matchsticks are going to go.
[22753.58s -> 22757.98s]  The three pieces of bread.
[22757.98s -> 22763.26s]  I don't understand what I do with the meat though.
[22763.26s -> 22773.67s]  The bone is going to stay.
[22773.67s -> 22778.83s]  I have these two toolboxes that I'm thinking of getting rid of.
[22778.83s -> 22781.83s]  I have 50 nails.
[22781.83s -> 22785.46s]  Get rid of the potato. Put the rag in here.
[22785.46s -> 22789.08s]  Get the flashlight in here.
[22789.08s -> 22792.70s]  The shotgun in here.
[22792.70s -> 22798.42s]  The alcohol. The rope.
[22798.42s -> 22801.66s]  The molotovs. Get this out of here.
[22801.66s -> 22806.31s]  Get this out of here. Unnecessary.
[22806.31s -> 22812.62s]  I'm just going to throw it on the ground.
[22812.62s -> 22821.05s]  All this shit is out of here.
[22822.05s -> 22829.93s]  Well. Let me ask you this.
[22829.93s -> 22832.93s]  So if tomorrow I played something else.
[22832.93s -> 22837.37s]  And then the next day I went back to this.
[22837.37s -> 22845.73s]  Break it up a little bit.
[22845.73s -> 22851.02s]  You're not going to play this again if I do that.
[22851.02s -> 22858.91s]  Do I need to break it up or do we just play it?
[22858.91s -> 22864.90s]  Change the pace and then let's play it.
[22864.90s -> 22875.10s]  Let's get it done. Yeah. Let's just finish it tomorrow.
[22875.10s -> 22880.90s]  You're never going to finish it. You're not going to finish it tomorrow.
[22880.90s -> 22883.90s]  There's like 12 hours left.
[22883.90s -> 22890.20s]  Well. Alright we're going to break it up.
[22890.20s -> 22893.20s]  No we're not. I don't know. I don't know. We'll see tomorrow.
[22893.20s -> 22899.14s]  I have the super spooky jumpscare mansion HD to play.
[22899.14s -> 22910.94s]  I want to do that. You're weak.
[22910.94s -> 22918.01s]  What if we do that tomorrow?
[22918.01s -> 22923.14s]  And then I think that game is only 3 or 4 hours long.
[22923.14s -> 22926.14s]  So if we do that tomorrow.
[22926.14s -> 22930.58s]  And then just move on to this.
[22930.58s -> 22933.58s]  Play this for like another couple hours.
[22933.58s -> 22944.10s]  That sounds fun. Let's do that.
[22944.10s -> 22947.79s]  We'll play this tomorrow after that for a while.
[22947.79s -> 22952.44s]  What game am I playing tomorrow? Jumpscare Mansion.
[22952.44s -> 22955.44s]  I think that's what it's called. Something like that.
[22955.44s -> 22958.44s]  Like the spooky jumpscare mansion.
[22958.44s -> 22961.68s]  But I'm too far into this I think to just give up on it now.
[22961.68s -> 22967.48s]  So we're going to do this again.
[22967.48s -> 22971.17s]  Maybe 2 or 3 hours of this.
[22971.17s -> 22974.60s]  And then the next day play this again.
[22974.60s -> 22979.06s]  Because I did say I wanted to do 4 days in a row.
[22979.06s -> 22988.49s]  I think I'm going to call it here.
[22988.49s -> 22993.49s]  The exact like 6 hour mark I think is like a perfect time for a game like this for me.
[22993.49s -> 22999.53s]  It's enough for me to get over the stress.
[22999.53s -> 23002.53s]  So that tomorrow we'll do the spooky mansion and then come back to this for like a few hours.
[23002.53s -> 23008.63s]  Time is passing in game? That's alright.
[23008.63s -> 23013.22s]  Okay I was going to throw this stuff away.
[23013.22s -> 23016.22s]  Well let me finish. Let me get through this last night.
[23016.22s -> 23022.72s]  So I can sell this crap. That sounds like a good idea.
[23022.72s -> 23029.29s]  I'm going to get rid of these bottles.
[23029.29s -> 23033.10s]  Yeah I'm going to sell all this junk. Red, shiny stone.
[23033.10s -> 23036.10s]  Okay I have the shovel. Alright well I'm going to get through this.
[23036.10s -> 23039.10s]  And then I'm going to clean up the inventory so it's ready to go for tomorrow.
[23039.10s -> 23044.86s]  So in the meantime I'm going to get my lost stuff that's over here.
[23044.86s -> 23057.62s]  Let's go. He's never going to finish this game.
[23057.62s -> 23061.86s]  I might. I'm willing to give this at least another 1 or 2 solid.
[23061.86s -> 23065.86s]  At least 4 to 7 hours of game.
[23065.86s -> 23070.32s]  I'm too far into this to not.
[23070.32s -> 23074.32s]  I'm like 60-70% of the way through this game.
[23074.32s -> 23082.36s]  Okay here we are. Lost inventory is right here somewhere.
[23082.36s -> 23087.26s]  There it is. Good.
[23087.26s -> 23098.62s]  Alright I got it.
[23098.62s -> 23116.82s]  We'll close out this last night.
[23116.82s -> 23120.18s]  Is it chapter 2? Yeah I would assume.
[23121.18s -> 23129.94s]  You don't start a game that says welcome to chapter 1 and there's no chapter 2.
[23129.94s -> 23142.69s]  This shit just got to make it to tomorrow.
[23142.69s -> 23146.06s]  I'm going to sell the flares.
[23146.06s -> 23150.06s]  I don't care about them really at all.
[23150.06s -> 23154.46s]  Get rid of these bottles.
[23154.46s -> 23157.46s]  I'm 14 hours into this game.
[23157.46s -> 23161.46s]  I've not seen one use of the bottle besides to break and put glass on the ground.
[23161.46s -> 23164.46s]  You don't put shit in it. You don't put.
[23164.46s -> 23169.36s]  I don't want them anymore.
[23169.36s -> 23172.36s]  These jars of meat don't do anything either.
[23172.36s -> 23181.22s]  Make molotovs.
[23181.22s -> 23184.22s]  You have to use gas for this.
[23184.22s -> 23188.48s]  And rags.
[23188.48s -> 23191.48s]  Rags make bandages which are more important.
[23191.48s -> 23196.19s]  I'm just going to sell them all.
[23196.19s -> 23201.85s]  I'm going to recycle all these bottles.
[23201.85s -> 23204.85s]  In the meantime the final thing I'm going to do.
[23204.85s -> 23207.85s]  I'm going to go to the right because somehow I have not been over there.
[23207.85s -> 23213.20s]  I don't know how.
[23213.20s -> 23216.63s]  The lantern is really important later.
[23216.63s -> 23220.96s]  Yeah. I'll make the lantern later.
[23220.96s -> 23232.71s]  Have I not been over here? Is there nothing over here at all?
[23232.71s -> 23256.32s]  Doesn't look like it.
[23256.32s -> 23259.32s]  No. There is something over here.
[23259.32s -> 23265.44s]  Shrine.
[23265.44s -> 23270.66s]  What is this?
[23270.66s -> 23287.01s]  Shrine? Not going to get me this time.
[23287.01s -> 23291.46s]  Just kind of there.
[23291.46s -> 23299.62s]  Hey!
[23299.62s -> 23318.33s]  They're worth nine.
[23318.33s -> 23334.22s]  Where's the shiny stone?
[23334.22s -> 23348.58s]  Grab it.
[23348.58s -> 23353.36s]  Where the hell is that?
[23353.36s -> 23362.14s]  Where are you?
[23362.14s -> 23371.78s]  What? I don't want to die out here.
[23372.78s -> 23380.48s]  Let's go back.
[23380.48s -> 23383.48s]  Acid blood is paying off.
[23383.48s -> 23392.85s]  Now it actually is really, really good.
[23392.85s -> 23397.30s]  My house is starting to get taken over by this slime.
[23397.30s -> 23400.30s]  What have we got?
[23400.30s -> 23408.58s]  Deposit. Last one more night. Rearrange the inventory and then we can get out of here.
[23408.58s -> 23411.82s]  Didn't I just say I was done?
[23411.82s -> 23418.33s]  Yeah. I will be.
[23418.33s -> 23428.00s]  I want to get a good fresh save point.
[23428.00s -> 23431.30s]  Let's refill that.
[23431.30s -> 23438.94s]  I have a lot of lockpicks too.
[23438.94s -> 23448.07s]  That's good. I'm ready.
[23448.07s -> 23452.72s]  I'm going to use my heal.
[23452.72s -> 23455.72s]  I've got some time here.
[23455.72s -> 23459.98s]  I could go for some nice crunchy iceberg lettuce. That doesn't sound good.
[23459.98s -> 23472.04s]  No, it doesn't. Actually, it sounds terrible.
[23472.04s -> 23475.28s]  That's the real stuff coming out right there. Can't pretend on that one.
[23475.28s -> 23478.28s]  I need to board up this stuff one more time.
[23478.28s -> 23481.28s]  And a few nails.
[23481.28s -> 23484.90s]  A couple more nails.
[23484.90s -> 23495.55s]  A couple more at the fence.
[23495.55s -> 23501.48s]  That's barricaded. This is not.
[23501.48s -> 23505.17s]  This has plenty of gas. Yes.
[23505.17s -> 23510.20s]  This is okay, but not great.
[23510.20s -> 23516.91s]  You could have finished the game already if you didn't spend half the day inside your safe house.
[23516.91s -> 23521.69s]  You know, you're right.
[23521.69s -> 23525.55s]  That's true.
[23525.55s -> 23528.86s]  It's okay if I go out there.
[23528.86s -> 23531.86s]  That's actually true. I would have 50% more game time outside.
[23531.86s -> 23538.02s]  Or 100%.
[23538.02s -> 23546.64s]  I want this in front of the store.
[23546.64s -> 23553.98s]  Don't turn it on yet. These glass bottles.
[23553.98s -> 23557.66s]  This reminds me when I used to pick up plates in Fallout.
[23557.66s -> 23560.84s]  I just have 16 pounds or 20 pounds of silverware on me.
[23560.84s -> 23564.14s]  I get these out of here.
[23564.14s -> 23569.11s]  Cover the floor in glass.
[23569.11s -> 23592.19s]  This is the smartest thing I've heard all day.
[23592.19s -> 23601.83s]  Now I actually can't move. Put the glass outside the window.
[23601.83s -> 23614.27s]  I'll be fine. I gotta go.
[23614.27s -> 23623.40s]  Heals. Right, I'm gonna do this.
[23623.40s -> 23632.70s]  This doesn't do damage to me. Alright, that's good.
[23632.70s -> 23636.97s]  Hide in the corner.
[23636.97s -> 23639.97s]  This has been okay so far. I had that one dog problem.
[23639.97s -> 23642.97s]  Where the dogs would just jump in and out of the windows really quickly.
[23642.97s -> 23650.54s]  But I'm alright.
[23650.54s -> 23656.20s]  What about the band sheet?
[23656.20s -> 23672.62s]  Yeah, but that was once.
[23672.62s -> 23684.76s]  What currency is this? What do you mean, currency?
[23684.76s -> 23691.71s]  Someone just said I look like Michael Jackson.
[23691.71s -> 23709.29s]  Do people just write random words and press enter?
[23709.29s -> 23712.29s]  I don't look like Michael Jackson, okay?
[23712.29s -> 23744.95s]  Whatever.
[23744.95s -> 23747.95s]  Banana cream pie.
[23747.95s -> 23758.28s]  That's so mean.
[23759.28s -> 23765.46s]  Alright, this is where they come in.
[23765.46s -> 23789.42s]  21. I'm not in here.
[23789.42s -> 23811.02s]  Just don't move, don't move, don't move.
[23811.02s -> 23815.92s]  Oh god, take out the gun.
[23815.92s -> 23840.84s]  Where is he?
[23840.84s -> 23854.58s]  Don't move. Did he hear the gunshots and came around this way?
[23854.58s -> 23861.91s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[23861.91s -> 23865.79s]  Is this one of the...is that it?
[23865.79s -> 23880.30s]  Take it down! Take the window down!
[23880.30s -> 23932.54s]  Oh god.
[23932.54s -> 23944.28s]  What's that? What's that mean?
[23944.28s -> 23967.62s]  It's gonna leave my house. What the hell?
[23967.62s -> 24013.66s]  Get the sunlight out, please!
[24013.66s -> 24018.69s]  Well, that was annoying.
[24018.69s -> 24023.21s]  Okay, so let me do this real quick and then we can get out of here.
[24023.21s -> 24026.70s]  I have nothing to cook. I have a lot of things to sell you.
[24026.70s -> 24033.77s]  I have a lot of junk that I want to get rid of.
[24033.77s -> 24036.77s]  All the bottles. This is not like Fallout where he's gonna run out of money, right?
[24036.77s -> 24043.00s]  Shiny stone, shiny stone.
[24043.00s -> 24046.75s]  Take it all. I don't have enough room in his inventory.
[24046.75s -> 24053.30s]  Okay, what about a fabric?
[24053.30s -> 24056.30s]  Buy the mushroom and the fabric.
[24056.30s -> 24060.06s]  Because that's just a guarantee just I can upgrade something.
[24060.06s -> 24063.74s]  Get the metal. Where's your metal? There it is.
[24063.74s -> 24068.65s]  I got so much money with this dude.
[24068.65s -> 24071.89s]  Buy the rags. Buy the wire, always.
[24071.89s -> 24077.16s]  I'm also going to buy
[24077.16s -> 24082.37s]  And a fabric.
[24082.37s -> 24085.37s]  And then you're gonna take these matchsticks because they're stupid.
[24085.37s -> 24088.37s]  These flares because they're dumb.
[24088.37s -> 24093.02s]  The bread because you're hungry.
[24093.02s -> 24104.38s]  And the meat because you want something more than bread.
[24104.38s -> 24108.90s]  Let's do this.
[24108.90s -> 24117.90s]  I cannot craft any more of those so I'm gonna do another hotbar.
[24117.90s -> 24121.59s]  It's just an extra inventory slot.
[24121.59s -> 24124.59s]  Now, let's clean up the inventory.
[24124.59s -> 24127.83s]  The shovel, which is less stamina.
[24127.83s -> 24132.48s]  Tax use less stamina or should I just wait until I can get that?
[24132.48s -> 24135.48s]  I think I'm gonna do that.
[24135.48s -> 24141.33s]  I also can repair the armor.
[24141.33s -> 24145.46s]  This item cannot be repaired. The armor is not repairable.
[24145.46s -> 24149.66s]  Okay, interesting. Good to know.
[24149.66s -> 24157.30s]  Let's clean up the inventory. Bandage.
[24157.30s -> 24162.58s]  Lockpick. I got too many of these.
[24162.58s -> 24173.16s]  Hook the mushroom. Alright, here we go.
[24174.16s -> 24187.56s]  Can we confirm that these are useless?
[24187.56s -> 24191.57s]  Somebody that's played this like 4000 hours of this game.
[24191.57s -> 24198.76s]  Do I actually need this for anything? Just get rid of them.
[24198.76s -> 24201.76s]  You're good to sell them. Alright, I'm just gonna sell them.
[24201.76s -> 24205.32s]  I don't know if the wedding ring is needed for anything.
[24205.32s -> 24208.32s]  I have three lunchboxes. I don't know why I have this many.
[24208.32s -> 24214.94s]  That helps free up some room. So does this.
[24214.94s -> 24220.10s]  Meat. It's a chicken head I feel like at some point.
[24220.10s -> 24223.10s]  Maybe it would be useful? I don't know for what though.
[24223.10s -> 24229.71s]  Torch. Alright, let's get rid of these.
[24229.71s -> 24236.66s]  I really hope I don't need these for upgrades or anything.
[24236.66s -> 24240.27s]  Because I can't get them anywhere.
[24240.27s -> 24243.27s]  You need the boxes for upgrading the workbench.
[24243.27s -> 24247.92s]  You need them, you need them, you need them.
[24247.92s -> 24255.94s]  Well, shit. Oh, that's right.
[24255.94s -> 24260.53s]  The other workbenches though. Don't I have to do the other ones?
[24260.53s -> 24267.35s]  I already have them though. Is it already there?
[24267.35s -> 24271.53s]  There are more workbenches. They all have the same level.
[24271.53s -> 24280.58s]  They're global. Okay, okay.
[24280.58s -> 24285.78s]  So you can't take all this so I'm gonna do...
[24285.78s -> 24293.94s]  I could just get some more pills.
[24293.94s -> 24300.44s]  Get a red egg and cook it.
[24300.44s -> 24303.44s]  Make the axe. I can't make the axe until I upgrade the bench one more time.
[24303.44s -> 24312.30s]  So I cannot do that.
[24312.30s -> 24318.29s]  Hundred essence. Okay, organization time.
[24318.29s -> 24323.94s]  Gasoline. Which is something I kinda need to pay attention to.
[24323.94s -> 24327.24s]  Alcohol and gasoline can stay down here.
[24327.24s -> 24337.31s]  I'll craft like a super bandage.
[24337.31s -> 24340.55s]  There we go. And that looks good.
[24340.55s -> 24345.44s]  Three of those. So we got alcohol.
[24345.44s -> 24348.44s]  Miscellaneous junk. Weapons up here.
[24348.44s -> 24357.81s]  What's this mirror for?
[24357.81s -> 24360.81s]  Weapon part. Get the rag out of there.
[24360.81s -> 24365.26s]  Scrap metal come down here.
[24365.26s -> 24368.26s]  I'm gonna classify that as a weapon.
[24368.26s -> 24371.26s]  Technically, kind of. Chicken head's not a weapon.
[24371.26s -> 24376.98s]  Weapon part.
[24376.98s -> 24384.83s]  This bone seems kind of useless.
[24384.83s -> 24389.74s]  All those other stuff we'll put down there. Molotovs.
[24389.74s -> 24397.78s]  There's gonna be a drug category here.
[24397.78s -> 24400.78s]  Drugs and medicine will go down here.
[24400.78s -> 24408.94s]  Materials here.
[24408.94s -> 24412.95s]  Wood and other materials here.
[24412.95s -> 24420.54s]  Miscellaneous junk.
[24420.54s -> 24428.20s]  This shit is just junk, man.
[24428.20s -> 24435.58s]  Weapon parts.
[24435.58s -> 24438.82s]  Matchsticks. That can stay down here.
[24438.82s -> 24447.31s]  I wish I could put these in more than one stack.
[24447.31s -> 24450.31s]  Or more than, you know, two, three.
[24450.31s -> 24454.90s]  That's alright. Scrap metal.
[24454.90s -> 24458.20s]  Wood. Weapon parts can stay up here.
[24458.20s -> 24461.20s]  Axe. Shotgun for the axe.
[24461.20s -> 24464.20s]  Welder. Whatever. You can spray somebody in the face with it and hurt them.
[24464.20s -> 24468.02s]  Chicken head's gonna come down here.
[24468.02s -> 24471.02s]  Batteries are gonna go this way.
[24471.02s -> 24474.96s]  Other miscellaneous parts like wires and shit.
[24474.96s -> 24477.96s]  Everything that I don't know what the hell to do with is gonna go up here.
[24477.96s -> 24480.96s]  So I don't know what any of these are really supposed to be for.
[24480.96s -> 24483.96s]  I know the chicken egg is technically, it's like a healing item. Technically.
[24483.96s -> 24493.26s]  I'm good.
[24493.26s -> 24501.94s]  Feels good. Lockpicks up here. The nails.
[24501.94s -> 24509.78s]  Wood. We can turn this wood into new planks and put them over here.
[24509.78s -> 24513.21s]  Alright. Done.
[24513.21s -> 24516.64s]  We're organized.
[24516.64s -> 24530.76s]  Way more than I was before. Now.
[24530.76s -> 24536.37s]  Let's do this. Gasoline.
[24536.37s -> 24542.10s]  I'm gonna buy another, no I'm not. Not yet.
[24542.10s -> 24545.73s]  Let's do another tank.
[24545.73s -> 24556.97s]  My gasoline supply is starting to deplete.
[24556.97s -> 24561.30s]  More hotbar is very, very useful too.
[24561.30s -> 24577.08s]  I like it. This is a mod for don't starve.
[24577.08s -> 24590.74s]  Yes. That looks good.
[24590.74s -> 24596.02s]  Look it up. There we go.
[24596.02s -> 24602.38s]  I hate the one stack of shit.
[24602.38s -> 24606.14s]  Wood. This part, the metal shit can go up here.
[24606.14s -> 24614.67s]  Alright. I'm fine with this.
[24614.67s -> 24618.87s]  Nothing needs to be repaired or upgraded.
[24618.87s -> 24621.87s]  I can make traps if I wanted to, but no.
[24621.87s -> 24625.56s]  I'm not going to.
[24625.56s -> 24633.65s]  Anything else I want to get from you before I stop this? I don't think so.
[24633.65s -> 24644.87s]  Long barrel. We're good. Game is saved.
[24644.87s -> 24650.93s]  Got it.
[24650.93s -> 24655.38s]  And that is where we are going to call it a night.
[24655.38s -> 24658.38s]  We'll be ready for it tomorrow.
[24658.38s -> 24662.71s]  Tomorrow we're going to start with that jumpscare mansion.
[24662.71s -> 24665.71s]  And then from there we're going to try this again.
[24665.71s -> 24670.36s]  For a couple hours. And then we'll see what we want to do the night after that.
[24670.36s -> 24682.48s]  I'm into it. I think this is fun. I'm into it.
[24682.48s -> 24685.48s]  Hey. Don't mind me.
[24685.48s -> 24688.48s]  Just Jerebo985 continuing to be the person that's to give the most gifted subs ever apparently.
[24689.48s -> 24698.14s]  I still don't understand why this doesn't work.
[24698.14s -> 24701.14s]  Session top subgifter.
[24701.14s -> 24710.38s]  This just does not work.
[24710.38s -> 24713.38s]  I'm going to put it on weekly for now.
[24713.38s -> 24719.31s]  Because that seems to work, but that doesn't make any sense either.
[24719.31s -> 24722.55s]  Session top cheer.
[24722.55s -> 24730.53s]  How about weekly top cheer? Doesn't make any sense.
[24730.53s -> 24733.53s]  Streamlabs OBS. Not impressed.
[24733.53s -> 24750.26s]  This is apparently weekly.
[24751.26s -> 24764.96s]  This is all wrong.
[24764.96s -> 24775.05s]  This is the most recent cheer.
[24775.05s -> 24778.05s]  Unless I can find out a way why session top all these things that are sessions just do not work.
[24778.05s -> 24788.52s]  How about recent follower?
[24788.52s -> 24799.30s]  This is the most recent follower.
[24799.30s -> 24802.30s]  Hey comrade. Thanks for the recent follow. Appreciate it.
[24802.30s -> 24807.52s]  Welcome to the channel.
[24807.52s -> 24825.90s]  Alright guys. I will see you tomorrow. Take care.
[24825.90s -> 24835.66s]  We'll do the bits. Speaking of those things.
[24835.66s -> 24844.66s]  That's sad.
[24844.66s -> 24848.74s]  Why isn't the movie playing? Because the movie's over.
[24848.74s -> 24851.74s]  I'm going to start doing all my streams just inside of this theater.
[24851.74s -> 24858.48s]  On the screen.
[24864.48s -> 24867.66s]  So now onto my personal least favorite souls game.
[24867.66s -> 24871.60s]  Bloodborne.
[24871.60s -> 24878.30s]  Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
[24878.30s -> 24883.01s]  Souls game is Bloodborne.
[24883.01s -> 24889.24s]  Oh no. Alright. I would disagree with you.
[24889.24s -> 24892.78s]  But I mean that's alright.
[24892.78s -> 24896.98s]  Good luck for the rest of that.
[24896.98s -> 24900.67s]  Also most of the DLC has been completed in Dark Souls 1 and 2.
[24900.67s -> 24904.81s]  What is Darkwood about? I've never heard of it before. It looks interesting.
[24904.81s -> 24908.11s]  It is a game about living.
[24908.11s -> 24911.72s]  Surviving in the forest.
[24911.72s -> 24916.05s]  And there are cannibals that are eating people.
[24916.05s -> 24919.61s]  You may attack some of them.
[24919.61s -> 24923.36s]  And they've been eating people.
[24923.36s -> 24929.67s]  So that's why you did that. And that's why you decided that was a good idea.
[24929.67s -> 24932.67s]  But it's kind of just like a trippy you're in the woods.
[24932.67s -> 24936.04s]  And there's like a lot of psychological things happening.
[24936.04s -> 24939.04s]  And you have to be careful because at night time people come and try to kill you.
[24939.04s -> 24942.04s]  They may have been eating people.
[24942.04s -> 24945.04s]  Which is what I thought. That they were all part of the same kind of cult of sickos.
[24945.04s -> 24949.05s]  And I may have dropped a couple of them.
[24949.05s -> 24952.98s]  But that's on me.
[24952.98s -> 24963.24s]  Why are you in the woods? I don't know. That's a good question.
[24963.24s -> 24967.25s]  But good luck with the rest of your run, Spooky Spitfire. Thanks for the 250.
[24967.25s -> 24970.25s]  Hey broluck, thanks for the 500 bits. Hello Mr. Streamer Man.
[24970.25s -> 24973.25s]  Here's the 500 bits I owe you to keep my family safe.
[24973.25s -> 24976.25s]  Why do people keep doing this? I'm so sorry it's late but you're a reasonable person.
[24976.25s -> 24979.81s]  I'm sure you understand. Please let me just see them.
[24979.81s -> 24987.14s]  Why do people do this?
[24987.14s -> 24990.14s]  Hey white fox, thanks for the 300 bits. Hey man, love the streams.
[24990.14s -> 24993.32s]  Huh? Great stuff. Bearded dragons make great pets.
[24993.32s -> 24996.32s]  My brother's fraternity had one for three years and loved him to death.
[24996.32s -> 24999.32s]  Just made a weird pet purchase myself.
[24999.32s -> 25002.32s]  These are blue death feigning beetles.
[25002.32s -> 25005.32s]  Also known as desert iron clad beetles.
[25005.32s -> 25011.98s]  And they're pets. Wait, what?
[25011.98s -> 25026.87s]  The title of this video is Jerma Eats Ass.
[25026.87s -> 25030.05s]  This is supposed to be back here!
[25030.05s -> 25041.34s]  Signed to confirm my age! What?
[25041.34s -> 25045.86s]  The title of this video is Jerma Eats Ass.
[25045.86s -> 25051.72s]  I can't watch it on stream through the browser source.
[25051.72s -> 25059.50s]  Well here, if anyone wants to see this...
[25059.50s -> 25066.20s]  These things are ridiculous looking though. I couldn't do it.
[25066.20s -> 25075.33s]  Ah! He forgot his password.
[25075.33s -> 25078.33s]  I am... I've had it set up so I can watch them behind here.
[25078.33s -> 25090.46s]  They're big and they're huge and they're going to go...
[25090.46s -> 25093.46s]  They're going to crawl in my mouth and lay eggs in my mouth and down my throat.
[25093.46s -> 25102.18s]  They're actually not kind of cool looking though.
[25102.18s -> 25105.48s]  I'm eating.
[25105.48s -> 25113.57s]  Oh, sorry guys. Let me watch the stream.
[25113.57s -> 25118.34s]  And talk about all these things that the guy that I'm watching can't eat.
[25118.34s -> 25121.34s]  Banana cream pie, pizza, go get a banana cream pie.
[25121.34s -> 25124.34s]  Sorry, I said a bug was going to lay eggs down my throat and ruin your meal.
[25124.34s -> 25127.34s]  Oh, boo hoo.
[25127.34s -> 25130.34s]  I saw at least 200 banana cream pies in chat.
[25130.34s -> 25136.83s]  And if you want to see more of these videos,
[25136.83s -> 25143.08s]  I saw at least 200 banana cream pies in chat.
[25143.08s -> 25146.08s]  And if you happen to be one of those people that did not say banana cream pie and you were eating now,
[25146.08s -> 25149.08s]  I'm sorry. I do apologize.
[25149.08s -> 25152.08s]  But there's been a war going on here for the last like hour and 45 minutes.
[25152.08s -> 25163.58s]  I'm really sorry.
[25163.58s -> 25167.26s]  But yeah, bearded dragons are cool.
[25167.26s -> 25172.10s]  I'm still contemplating if I'm going to get one or not.
[25172.10s -> 25175.66s]  Trying to figure out exactly how that would work.
[25175.66s -> 25180.18s]  But they seem really fun. Seem like really interesting pets.
[25180.18s -> 25186.75s]  Iron clad beetles.
[25186.75s -> 25190.06s]  That's a really interesting hobby, though, to collect stuff like that and have pets like that.
[25190.06s -> 25194.37s]  To pets, as you say.
[25194.37s -> 25199.27s]  Thank you for the 300 bits.
[25199.27s -> 25202.45s]  Thank you, the wild ald, the wild ald, for the thousand bits.
[25202.45s -> 25205.45s]  Try not to look at chat. Best part of this game is figuring it out.
[25205.45s -> 25211.92s]  Yeah, it's true.
[25211.92s -> 25214.92s]  But if I get stuck in the village, I need you to tell me where the mayor's house is.
[25214.92s -> 25217.92s]  Otherwise, I'm going to be walking in a circle for 30 straight minutes.
[25217.92s -> 25220.92s]  And I don't want to do that.
[25220.92s -> 25225.95s]  I did say that backseating was okay for the streams.
[25225.95s -> 25229.77s]  Just because it's one of those...
[25229.77s -> 25233.39s]  It's one of those wiki games where this stuff you just kind of...
[25233.39s -> 25236.39s]  If you don't know, then you just might be in trouble.
[25236.39s -> 25249.14s]  Is that incorrect? Is it not?
[25249.14s -> 25252.14s]  Like if I sold something that was wrong,
[25252.14s -> 25256.64s]  then later on I could use it for something else.
[25256.64s -> 25259.64s]  This is 100% a game I would play with like 10 wiki tabs open.
[25259.64s -> 25267.22s]  The game even says in the beginning,
[25267.22s -> 25270.46s]  open up a wiki tab to help you,
[25270.46s -> 25273.46s]  because it's not going to hold your hand, but a wiki will.
[25273.46s -> 25283.54s]  That was part of the fine print at the bottom.
[25283.54s -> 25287.81s]  No, backseating is okay for these streams.
[25287.81s -> 25290.81s]  Just because I sometimes, especially with a game like this,
[25290.81s -> 25293.81s]  I do run into a wall a few times and I need to be nudged in the right direction.
[25293.81s -> 25298.14s]  So it's all good.
[25298.14s -> 25301.89s]  But the wild ald said,
[25301.89s -> 25305.45s]  1,000 bits in a row.
[25305.45s -> 25308.69s]  So that's 2,000 bits from the wild ald.
[25308.69s -> 25315.64s]  They say, this is my jam. I believe it was acid bass.
[25315.64s -> 25319.84s]  It's a great song.
[25319.84s -> 25327.10s]  I think I got it all.
[25327.10s -> 25331.47s]  Strength, intelligence, agility, friendship.
[25331.47s -> 25334.47s]  You know, I'm very much a friendship kind of person.
[25334.47s -> 25341.41s]  I can read at at least the 9th or 10th grade level.
[25341.41s -> 25354.42s]  It's probably me.
[25355.42s -> 25361.93s]  Devakitty, thanks for the 250.
[25361.93s -> 25364.93s]  Jerma, the big dogs are easy enough. You just need to stop losing your cool.
[25364.93s -> 25367.93s]  Whenever you miss any attack, you instantly get as tilted
[25367.93s -> 25374.50s]  as the fucking leaning tower of pizza.
[25374.50s -> 25377.50s]  Pizza.
[25377.50s -> 25383.04s]  Not pizza.
[25383.04s -> 25386.04s]  I know, but that's why I need you guys to backseat and help me sometimes.
[25386.04s -> 25392.86s]  Because, I don't know, I just...
[25392.86s -> 25405.06s]  Pizza's on the mind.
[25406.06s -> 25411.59s]  Banana cream pizza.
[25411.59s -> 25414.77s]  I wonder if I could make like a low FODMAP pizza.
[25414.77s -> 25417.77s]  It would have to be with like a fake crust.
[25417.77s -> 25421.01s]  Not real pizza crust.
[25421.01s -> 25424.01s]  A sauce that didn't have any garlic in it.
[25424.01s -> 25432.42s]  And just cheddar cheese all over it. It would be gross.
[25432.42s -> 25435.42s]  Nevermind.
[25435.42s -> 25439.34s]  Spooky Spitfire says, thanks for 250.
[25439.34s -> 25443.67s]  They say, Jerma, why aren't you able to eat anything?
[25443.67s -> 25447.17s]  I've been on a low FODMAP diet because
[25447.17s -> 25450.17s]  I've been having some annoying symptoms that won't go away.
[25450.17s -> 25453.41s]  And they may or may not even be related to my
[25453.41s -> 25456.84s]  intestinal irritable bowel disease.
[25456.84s -> 25460.45s]  We don't know.
[25460.45s -> 25463.69s]  I may have developed more stuff since cresting over like 32, 33 years old.
[25463.69s -> 25467.44s]  I have no idea.
[25467.44s -> 25470.94s]  So we're doing a low FODMAP diet for like a few weeks.
[25470.94s -> 25480.43s]  And we're gonna see what happens.
[25480.43s -> 25487.43s]  I don't think I want to do that.
[25487.43s -> 25490.43s]  Yeah, FODMAP. Essentially it is a fermentable carbohydrate
[25490.43s -> 25494.50s]  from my understanding that is in fructose.
[25494.50s -> 25497.50s]  High fructose corn syrup is, I may as well be drinking poison
[25497.50s -> 25500.81s]  if I have a FODMAP intolerance.
[25500.81s -> 25504.24s]  Also, garlic and onions are absolute zero.
[25504.24s -> 25508.50s]  Cannot have them ever. And that's the worst part.
[25508.50s -> 25511.50s]  Garlic is in everything. Onion is in everything.
[25511.50s -> 25514.68s]  Even if it's not physically on your plate, it is somehow in a seasoning blend.
[25514.68s -> 25527.44s]  That's why I can't really eat out right now.
[25527.44s -> 25531.19s]  Onion and garlic are, garlic is seriously one of my favorite foods on Earth.
[25531.19s -> 25535.97s]  So unfortunate. Can't eat garlic.
[25535.97s -> 25539.21s]  It is an incredibly concentrated place where FODMAPs come from.
[25539.21s -> 25548.08s]  Time just to, I can eat lettuce and meat.
[25548.08s -> 25552.07s]  It's kind of like a low carb diet, but you're not allowed to have onions and garlic.
[25552.07s -> 25556.78s]  So a lot of bread is off the table.
[25556.78s -> 25560.73s]  A lot of dairy is off the table.
[25560.73s -> 25563.90s]  A lot of, I can be one of those people that eats
[25563.90s -> 25567.08s]  a hamburger with a fork and a knife.
[25567.08s -> 25570.38s]  I can have a patty and cheese with like mayo on it.
[25570.38s -> 25573.88s]  And maybe a little bit of mustard and eat it with a fork and a knife.
[25573.88s -> 25577.31s]  It's kind of like a low carb, no bread sort of thing.
[25577.31s -> 25580.31s]  And no garlic and no onions. And no fructose. No fructose corn syrup.
[25580.31s -> 25587.57s]  I can eat sugar though, so that's okay. So we'll see what happens.
[25587.57s -> 25594.63s]  I'm gonna let my doctor help me out here and we'll see what he does.
[25594.63s -> 25597.63s]  Hey, let's put the credits on the screen.
[25597.63s -> 25604.18s]  Thank you everybody. All the subs.
[25604.18s -> 25614.19s]  We'll see you tomorrow. Here they come.
[25614.19s -> 25617.19s]  And sign in to confirm your age needs to get off the screen as well.
[25617.19s -> 25627.01s]  Because that's, well I don't know why that's still here. This movie sucks.
[25627.01s -> 25630.01s]  But anyways, thank you CVFD721.
[25630.01s -> 25633.87s]  Thank you CVFD.
[25633.87s -> 25639.21s]  For 2500 bits.
[25639.21s -> 25643.22s]  $25 total here from CVFD.
[25643.22s -> 25646.22s]  They say, yo Jerma, just want to say thank you for helping me and plenty of others
[25646.22s -> 25650.08s]  get through the monotonous grind of work.
[25650.08s -> 25657.59s]  I feel pretty good. I feel pretty good.
[25657.59s -> 25663.82s]  But thank you so much for the 2500 bits.
[25663.82s -> 25667.88s]  If you got me on at work, just don't get fired.
[25667.88s -> 25670.88s]  Because I've said like I shit in my diaper and stuff before.
[25670.88s -> 25673.88s]  Just make sure you have headphones in. Don't accidentally have your chair get caught
[25673.88s -> 25681.33s]  and pull the headphones out and it's like I shit in a diaper.
[25681.33s -> 25684.33s]  And then all of a sudden all your coworkers are looking at you.
[25684.33s -> 25690.32s]  I've said that exact phrase probably 6 or 7 times.
[25690.32s -> 25694.07s]  So at that point I've said on stream and on camera
[25694.07s -> 25697.50s]  16 to 17 billion words.
[25697.50s -> 25700.50s]  So how many words are in I just shit in a...
[25700.50s -> 25704.24s]  I just shit in a diaper. 6.
[25704.24s -> 25707.24s]  So 6, 12, 18, 24, 32.
[25707.24s -> 25711.06s]  So you're talking about there's a chance.
[25711.06s -> 25714.06s]  Maybe like 42, 45 out of 17 or 18 billion.
[25714.06s -> 25720.11s]  So it's still possible. Be careful.
[25720.11s -> 25734.55s]  Apple Shift, thanks for the 250.
[25734.55s -> 25738.30s]  Hey, since Halloween is around the corner, do you believe in ghosts? If so, have you ever seen one?
[25738.30s -> 25741.93s]  I do not believe in ghosts.
[25741.93s -> 25746.69s]  Or what most people think of when they think of a ghost.
[25746.69s -> 25749.69s]  I remember watching somebody talk about this before.
[25749.69s -> 25754.06s]  I think there was like a comedian or somebody that talked about this.
[25754.06s -> 25757.99s]  But it's true. If there were ghosts, where are they all going to go?
[25757.99s -> 25761.23s]  You know how many hundreds and hundreds of millions of people
[25761.23s -> 25764.98s]  that have passed away?
[25764.98s -> 25768.29s]  There are billions of people that have probably died.
[25768.29s -> 25771.85s]  Are they just walking around in your house?
[25773.54s -> 25779.66s]  Walking around as a ghost?
[25779.66s -> 25784.80s]  That would mean that not everyone becomes a ghost.
[25784.80s -> 25792.07s]  Well, why do you become a ghost?
[25792.07s -> 25800.99s]  What makes you allowed to be a ghost?
[25800.99s -> 25803.99s]  They watch over you.
[25803.99s -> 25807.55s]  Let's just say like my great-great-grand-papa is watching over me right now.
[25807.55s -> 25810.55s]  Is his great-great-great-grand-papa watching over him too?
[25810.55s -> 25814.50s]  Like in the same spot?
[25814.50s -> 25823.11s]  Making sure he doesn't screw up?
[25824.11s -> 25830.66s]  No, he went to the afterlife.
[25830.66s -> 25836.59s]  How long do you have to watch somebody before you get to go?
[25836.59s -> 25840.09s]  Is that part of the criteria? You have to watch for like 20 years?
[25840.09s -> 25853.30s]  You have to tag out. You have to tag out.
[25853.30s -> 25861.90s]  I don't want to do that.
[25861.90s -> 25866.35s]  That does not sound like a great time to me.
[25866.35s -> 25869.72s]  So my great-grand-child, I'm sitting there to watch him?
[25869.72s -> 25873.92s]  What about like 2.30 in the morning when they're in the bathroom
[25873.92s -> 25877.67s]  eating boogers and they're like 40?
[25877.67s -> 25887.06s]  Do I have to watch that?
[25887.06s -> 25890.06s]  Do I have to watch every time that my great-great-great-grand-nephew
[25890.06s -> 25893.06s]  the grandson goes to the bathroom?
[25893.06s -> 25902.55s]  Do I just not? No, no, no.
[25902.55s -> 25910.90s]  He's like taking a dump down there. I clock out.
[25910.90s -> 25913.90s]  Alright, I'm going to clock out for like 10 minutes.
[25913.90s -> 25917.78s]  You only get one break or two breaks during the day.
[25917.78s -> 25920.95s]  You come back and they're still taking a shit.
[25920.95s -> 25925.33s]  You're like, god damn it.
[25926.33s -> 25937.42s]  You have to go sleep?
[25937.42s -> 25940.98s]  You have to go to bed. You don't sleep?
[25940.98s -> 25945.76s]  You have to watch that person sleeping all night.
[25945.76s -> 25949.90s]  Got news for you. There ain't no Nintendo Switch up there.
[25949.90s -> 25952.90s]  It's you and binoculars looking at your great-great-grandson sleeping.
[25952.90s -> 25964.46s]  You don't get to go to sleep?
[25964.46s -> 25968.78s]  Oh, and he's watching over me.
[25968.78s -> 25973.18s]  You hear like a gust of wind.
[25973.18s -> 25981.07s]  That was him. He's telling me something.
[25981.07s -> 25985.66s]  I heard the wind gust at the door at the bathroom.
[25985.66s -> 25988.66s]  Yeah, it's called get out of the bathroom. I'm trying to get you to do something else.
[25988.66s -> 25994.33s]  You know those house noises you hear that are like...
[25994.33s -> 26000.42s]  That's your great-great-grandfather trying to get you to do something else.
[26000.42s -> 26008.46s]  Because you're boring the shit out of him.
[26008.46s -> 26013.62s]  What kind of house do you live in?
[26013.62s -> 26017.95s]  You know, there's lightning outside.
[26017.95s -> 26020.95s]  That's somebody's great-great-great-grandfather annoyed
[26020.95s -> 26030.70s]  that they've been in the bathroom for too long.
[26030.70s -> 26047.94s]  Okay, we have to move on.
[26047.94s -> 26050.94s]  It's gone. It's gone. It went there.
[26050.94s -> 26059.88s]  I was trying to avoid it, but it went there. I gotta move on.
[26059.88s -> 26062.88s]  The great-great-great-grandfather won't even understand what a phone is.
[26062.88s -> 26068.23s]  You're like, no one's gonna tell them.
[26068.23s -> 26071.47s]  Who's gonna tell them what a phone is?
[26071.47s -> 26074.47s]  Imagine like your great-great-great-great caveman grandfather.
[26074.47s -> 26077.97s]  No, he's gonna be swinging his club around up there
[26077.97s -> 26080.97s]  trying to like hit your great-great-great like
[26080.97s -> 26083.97s]  one grandfather with like a club.
[26083.97s -> 26098.20s]  This gets chaos up there. You don't know what a phone is.
[26098.20s -> 26101.70s]  They all have to teach each other everything again.
[26101.70s -> 26104.70s]  You have to teach the great-great-great caveman grandfather
[26104.70s -> 26107.94s]  all of human history for them to understand.
[26107.94s -> 26110.94s]  And then you need to be taught by the person
[26110.94s -> 26113.94s]  in front of you a generation what television is.
[26113.94s -> 26117.82s]  I do not envy that situation.
[26117.82s -> 26132.69s]  Constant conflict up in guardian ghost land.
[26133.69s -> 26140.82s]  What is cloud gaming?
[26140.82s -> 26144.82s]  Cloud gaming? What cloud gaming?
[26144.82s -> 26148.00s]  Me hit rabbit in head with club.
[26148.00s -> 26151.74s]  Okay. Did you spin that guy around
[26151.74s -> 26163.55s]  and like make him walk in another direction?
[26163.55s -> 26166.55s]  Just go that way for like 400,000 miles
[26166.55s -> 26169.55s]  because distance is completely relative.
[26169.55s -> 26172.55s]  It does not even exist.
[26172.55s -> 26175.55s]  You could have great-great-great-great-great caveman.
[26175.55s -> 26178.55s]  I'm not gonna add very much to the conversation,
[26178.55s -> 26181.55s]  so just point him in a direction and tell him to walk
[26181.55s -> 26184.55s]  and tell him that there's like a nice, crunchy rabbit
[26184.55s -> 26187.55s]  like 200 million miles that way.
[26187.55s -> 26196.47s]  At least he'll get some peace and quiet for a while.
[26196.47s -> 26200.86s]  You assume he can understand.
[26200.86s -> 26203.86s]  Well, at some point, this has got to be like a mutiny.
[26203.86s -> 26207.17s]  They've got to get rid of him.
[26207.17s -> 26210.17s]  I would assume they have some type of hierarchy.
[26213.71s -> 26216.71s]  The caveman is gonna be the first one,
[26216.71s -> 26221.22s]  so there's gonna be like an uprising,
[26221.22s -> 26227.66s]  and they'll just find a way to get rid of him.
[26227.66s -> 26231.79s]  It would be the oldest. That's exactly what I'm saying.
[26231.79s -> 26235.40s]  They would not have any time at all to watch over you
[26235.40s -> 26238.40s]  because great-great-great caveman grandfather
[26238.40s -> 26241.64s]  is gonna tell everybody they need to find pebbles
[26241.64s -> 26244.64s]  and trade teeth and stuff, and they're not gonna have time
[26244.64s -> 26254.97s]  to watch you go to the bathroom and kill him again.
[26254.97s -> 26257.97s]  They kill him again, and he goes up another level.
[26257.97s -> 26260.97s]  It's like Inception. He goes up another level.
[26260.97s -> 26264.91s]  They're killing each other up there.
[26264.91s -> 26279.93s]  What? Getting even stronger.
[26279.93s -> 26286.93s]  Anyways, thank you to Cyrus Dexter
[26286.93s -> 26289.93s]  for the 251 bits. Appreciate it.
[26289.93s -> 26294.00s]  And Apple Shift, thanks for the 250.
[26294.00s -> 26297.00s]  And no, I do not believe in ghosts in the traditional sense.
[26297.00s -> 26304.98s]  I mean, could there be such thing as like a spirit
[26304.98s -> 26307.98s]  or a soul or something that electromagnetically
[26307.98s -> 26311.98s]  is still around after a while and maybe like after a while?
[26311.98s -> 26314.98s]  I don't know, guys. I'm of the opinion that it's possible
[26314.98s -> 26317.98s]  that when you die, you know, when you dream,
[26317.98s -> 26320.98s]  your brain activity slows down, right, to a point
[26320.98s -> 26323.98s]  where I might think about this.
[26323.98s -> 26327.60s]  If your brain activity slows down to a point
[26327.60s -> 26330.60s]  where it's so slow and you're shutting down,
[26330.60s -> 26335.03s]  10 minutes in real life might be like 6,000 years.
[26335.03s -> 26338.40s]  You might live like 50,000 more lifetimes
[26338.40s -> 26342.77s]  in like a dream world because your brain is slowing down so much.
[26342.77s -> 26354.33s]  That might happen. This is a Black Mirror episode.
[26354.33s -> 26358.66s]  I don't know. I don't know.
[26358.66s -> 26364.46s]  What if your head is destroyed? That's the thing.
[26364.46s -> 26368.46s]  Time is relative to when that person is experiencing time.
[26368.46s -> 26372.63s]  Because, well, let's say you go have surgery, right?
[26372.63s -> 26376.63s]  When you go get put under by, you know, the anesthesiologist,
[26377.63s -> 26380.63s]  oh, hey, okay, it's time for me to do this.
[26380.63s -> 26384.63s]  I just woke up. 12 hours may have gone by.
[26384.63s -> 26388.38s]  Time is relative to who is experiencing it.
[26388.38s -> 26400.03s]  So who's to say that if your brain activity slows down,
[26400.03s -> 26404.03s]  10 minutes could be just 10 hours to you.
[26404.03s -> 26409.81s]  So by the time that they actually bring you to where,
[26409.81s -> 26413.88s]  a funeral home or crematorium,
[26413.88s -> 26417.44s]  you're talking about it could be like a couple of days,
[26417.44s -> 26420.44s]  which could be 200 to 300 years.
[26420.44s -> 26427.16s]  I'm going right for the caveman, I'll tell you.
[26427.16s -> 26429.85s]  I'm sprinting at caveman.
[26429.85s -> 26434.50s]  I'm going to be the new king up there.
[26434.50s -> 26440.83s]  It's going to be hard though because there's going to be
[26440.83s -> 26442.83s]  like 5,000 other people there.
[26442.83s -> 26444.83s]  Just like, it's going to be like a train.
[26444.83s -> 26446.83s]  You're going to be like on a train.
[26446.83s -> 26455.00s]  I'm going to be the king of ghost land. Yes, you'll see.
[26455.00s -> 26460.67s]  Banana, banana.
[26460.67s -> 26463.67s]  I have to go. Banana crematorium pie.
[26463.67s -> 26471.93s]  Nice, okay.
[26471.93s -> 26475.93s]  Thank you archive.png for the thousand bits.
[26475.93s -> 26479.17s]  They say, hey, Jerma, I've been starting making an archive
[26479.17s -> 26481.17s]  of your streams, which has the chat in view.
[26481.17s -> 26484.41s]  I've got 16 full streams with the chat up so far.
[26484.41s -> 26486.41s]  Right now, these archives aren't worth that much to anyone,
[26486.41s -> 26489.41s]  but I think there might be a lot of people who are glad
[26489.41s -> 26492.41s]  they can watch old Jerma streams and see the chat in the future.
[26492.41s -> 26494.41s]  Gives you an additional perspective on the streams at least.
[26494.41s -> 26497.71s]  You can find this archive by searching it on YouTube
[26497.71s -> 26500.21s]  and by sorting by date, by the way.
[26500.21s -> 26504.94s]  There is a channel that archives every stream I've ever done,
[26504.94s -> 26511.47s]  but they don't do the chat on it.
[26511.47s -> 26516.27s]  He's going to take it down.
[26516.27s -> 26522.80s]  I think you overestimate how much I care about that.
[26522.80s -> 26524.80s]  There is an archive channel that actually does that,
[26524.80s -> 26531.20s]  but not with the chat, I don't think.
[26531.20s -> 26533.20s]  There is a Jerma Streams archive.
[26533.20s -> 26539.02s]  Mean to him? What? No.
[26539.02s -> 26542.02s]  I'm just, I'm saying that I'm, that doesn't bother me.
[26542.02s -> 26544.02s]  It's not like a, wait, hold on a minute.
[26544.02s -> 26547.02s]  You're taking my content
[26547.02s -> 26557.47s]  and you're putting it up on your channel?
[26557.47s -> 26560.47s]  I'll take it down. They're monopolizing my humor.
[26560.47s -> 26564.80s]  They're monopolizing off of my humor.
[26564.80s -> 26566.80s]  More of my royalties!
[26566.80s -> 26569.49s]  Because I know what YouTube pays.
[26569.49s -> 26576.50s]  If I was to really go after somebody
[26576.50s -> 26580.70s]  for potentially making, like,
[26580.70s -> 26584.25s]  let's say a video like that got, like,
[26584.25s -> 26588.38s]  five to, like, three, four, five thousand views,
[26588.38s -> 26590.38s]  am I really going to go after somebody
[26590.38s -> 26603.70s]  for, like, fucking three dollars?
[26603.70s -> 26607.73s]  Probably. Yes. Yes.
[26607.73s -> 26610.80s]  That's McChicken money.
[26610.80s -> 26615.00s]  That's one of the, like, the whole, well,
[26615.00s -> 26617.00s]  copyright infringement and copy striking
[26617.00s -> 26619.00s]  and content ID and stuff.
[26619.00s -> 26621.00s]  It's like, really, do you, like,
[26621.00s -> 26623.00s]  that seems like way too much effort to
[26623.00s -> 26627.30s]  try to spend, like, sixty days
[26627.30s -> 26629.80s]  to make, like, twelve dollars.
[26629.80s -> 26636.07s]  YouTube does not pay what it used to.
[26636.07s -> 26646.63s]  Depends on the context.
[26646.63s -> 26650.45s]  Okay, right. So, let me give you an example.
[26650.45s -> 26653.45s]  If somebody were to make a video of my voice
[26653.45s -> 26655.45s]  doing something terrible, or
[26655.45s -> 26657.45s]  making it look like I did something
[26657.45s -> 26660.45s]  or said something that I didn't do that was incredibly awful,
[26660.45s -> 26663.45s]  like, actually crossing the line for something,
[26663.45s -> 26665.45s]  like, truly crossing the line, and you all know
[26665.45s -> 26667.45s]  what the things I could be referring to.
[26667.45s -> 26674.31s]  And that video had a shitload of views.
[26674.31s -> 26676.31s]  It would be like, okay, what do I do here?
[26676.31s -> 26686.74s]  Deep fake of you eating boogers.
[26686.74s -> 26695.30s]  But, no, if, if, let's put it this way,
[26695.30s -> 26697.30s]  if somebody were to ever make a video
[26697.30s -> 26701.70s]  about, like, my stream or something,
[26701.70s -> 26703.70s]  or me, or, like, you,
[26703.70s -> 26705.94s]  look, this, I have no leg to stand on here.
[26705.94s -> 26710.24s]  I, I put out into the wild
[26710.24s -> 26712.48s]  six straight hours of green screen footage.
[26712.48s -> 26714.48s]  Am I, you're gonna, I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna
[26714.48s -> 26716.48s]  copyright strike people?
[26716.48s -> 26720.38s]  It's over, at this point.
[26720.38s -> 26724.03s]  I royalty free threw out
[26724.03s -> 26726.59s]  a half a day's worth of green screen stuff
[26726.59s -> 26730.09s]  which, by the way, I guess I'll announce it right now.
[26730.09s -> 26734.66s]  I'm gonna get back in front of that screen very soon.
[26734.66s -> 26736.96s]  We're gonna do, we're gonna do part two.
[26736.96s -> 26744.64s]  Too much interesting stuff has come out of that
[26744.64s -> 26747.94s]  that it would be a shame if I didn't add DLC, right?
[26747.94s -> 26751.66s]  Free DLC, by the way.
[26751.66s -> 26756.90s]  It's just gonna put it up again.
[26756.90s -> 26758.90s]  So we'll do, after Halloween,
[26758.90s -> 26761.45s]  we will compile some more stuff
[26761.45s -> 26763.45s]  that you guys want me to do
[26763.45s -> 26765.45s]  in front of that screen, and I'll do another, like,
[26765.45s -> 26767.45s]  four, five, six hours in front of the green screen.
[26767.45s -> 26776.52s]  But no, I've, that doesn't, I don't,
[26776.52s -> 26778.52s]  that does not bother me. I don't, that doesn't,
[26778.52s -> 26780.52s]  I don't get into that.
[26780.52s -> 26784.10s]  If you want to make a video or something
[26784.10s -> 26786.10s]  on something that I've done or said
[26786.10s -> 26788.86s]  or you want to use green screen footage,
[26788.86s -> 26790.86s]  that's your shit. Like, I don't,
[26790.86s -> 26792.86s]  that doesn't bother me. It's not like, oh, well,
[26792.86s -> 26795.35s]  hold on a minute, dear.
[26795.35s -> 26797.35s]  I don't want you to use that JoJo dance
[26797.35s -> 26802.73s]  in that video.
[26802.73s -> 26804.73s]  But, that kind of
[26804.73s -> 26806.73s]  goes all around in a circle there.
[26806.73s -> 26809.03s]  No, I have an
[26809.03s -> 26811.03s]  archive channel. I don't have one,
[26811.03s -> 26813.03s]  but I have, like, a sort of unofficially
[26813.03s -> 26815.46s]  yesed
[26815.46s -> 26817.46s]  on an archive channel.
[26817.46s -> 26820.84s]  If they don't do chat, maybe
[26820.84s -> 26822.84s]  it'll be worth seeing if
[26822.84s -> 26824.84s]  people really want that that badly
[26824.84s -> 26826.84s]  or should the streams on that
[26826.84s -> 26834.20s]  archive stay that way? We want
[26834.20s -> 26837.66s]  chat. We want it.
[26837.66s -> 26839.66s]  Well, let me
[26839.66s -> 26841.66s]  ask a question or two.
[26841.66s -> 26845.35s]  Am I gonna stream
[26845.35s -> 26847.35s]  the entire green screen? Yeah.
[26847.35s -> 26852.84s]  Like we did last time.
[26852.84s -> 26854.84s]  The exact same thing we did last time, but just a bunch
[26854.84s -> 26858.49s]  of new actions. Thank you,
[26858.49s -> 26860.49s]  Produce, Produces
[26860.49s -> 26862.49s]  San, or Produce
[26862.49s -> 26864.49s]  Sasan. Thanks for the thousand bits.
[26864.49s -> 26866.92s]  I'm not kidding. You, the
[26866.92s -> 26868.92s]  first stream I ever saw of yours was the carnival stream,
[26868.92s -> 26871.22s]  so I'm relatively new. Welcome,
[26871.22s -> 26873.53s]  first of all, if you're still here. But I've known
[26873.53s -> 26875.53s]  about you for a while thanks to Joel and Vinny.
[26875.53s -> 26877.53s]  You three have been keeping me going these past couple
[26877.53s -> 26879.77s]  months. It's been rough trying to figure out where I
[26879.77s -> 26881.77s]  am in life, but you making me laugh is
[26881.77s -> 26883.77s]  more than enough to let me know it's gonna be alright.
[26883.77s -> 26887.10s]  Thank you for even stopping by this channel.
[26887.10s -> 26889.59s]  The other two people that you
[26889.59s -> 26891.59s]  mentioned there are absolutely fantastic
[26891.59s -> 26895.11s]  streamers. They're
[26895.11s -> 26899.08s]  some of the best, I would say.
[26899.08s -> 26901.08s]  So thank you for even putting me into that
[26901.08s -> 26906.63s]  category with those two.
[26906.63s -> 26910.34s]  I'm glad you found the stream. Hopefully you have
[26910.34s -> 26913.03s]  fun here. Hopefully you have
[26913.03s -> 26916.92s]  enough laughs, enough
[26916.92s -> 26919.35s]  chill time here is really all
[26919.35s -> 26924.98s]  I want. So thank you.
[26924.98s -> 26926.98s]  And say hello to Vinny and Joel
[26926.98s -> 26928.98s]  for me. Next time you see them.
[26928.98s -> 26932.25s]  Phylacter Lich just gave
[26932.25s -> 26934.25s]  five thousand bits right now.
[26934.25s -> 26936.25s]  Fifty dollars Phylacter Lich.
[26936.25s -> 26938.25s]  Jerma, watch this video.
[26938.25s -> 26940.25s]  What's the over under that this is a
[26940.25s -> 26949.98s]  Jimmy Neutron video?
[26949.98s -> 26957.40s]  Fifty-fifty. This is a Source
[26957.40s -> 26961.88s]  Filmmaker video.
[26961.88s -> 26964.57s]  I should watch this video. What is
[26964.57s -> 26970.46s]  this? This Wonderwall?
[26970.46s -> 26984.73s]  I'm not old enough to watch this
[26984.73s -> 26997.26s]  video.
[26997.26s -> 27013.70s]  Fucking god.
[27013.70s -> 27015.70s]  ...
[27030.39s -> 27032.76s]  Is this
[27032.76s -> 27042.42s]  the...
[27050.76s -> 27052.76s]  Can this get picked up by
[27052.76s -> 27054.76s]  the Content ID system on Twitch
[27054.76s -> 27056.76s]  because it's so fucked up?
[27077.10s -> 27079.10s]  Archive it quick before it gets muted!
[27079.74s -> 27127.59s]  Full house?
[27129.27s -> 27151.37s]  Nice.
[27151.37s -> 27154.49s]  Somebody said I missed the best part, so I went back to see the best part.
[27154.49s -> 27167.66s]  Oh, here's the link if you want to watch it. Trying to stay within terms of service.
[27167.66s -> 27170.14s]  Yeah, I'm trying to st- I'm trying. I am.
[27171.26s -> 27178.78s]  Dr. McNinja, thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[27179.22s -> 27184.81s]  Right at the end here.
[27184.81s -> 27192.51s]  Devikitty also gave 250. Hope that ancestors don't look over me when they're dead. I don't want some old fuck watching me
[27195.27s -> 27197.27s]  hanging out somewhere.
[27197.39s -> 27201.19s]  What if when you die you become a Twitch shatterer? Mugga ass.
[27210.04s -> 27213.84s]  And then dorkcube. Thanks dorkcube for the 250. I post this in the game recommendation channel,
[27213.84s -> 27215.84s]  but I wanted to send this directly to you.
[27215.96s -> 27220.60s]  Murder by numbers a murder mystery pick-ross game by the maker of Hatipful
[27221.16s -> 27229.27s]  Boyfriend. I do check the recommended every pretty much every two days and see what everybody has written. I will check this out, though.
[27230.39s -> 27237.78s]  The balacuola just came in with thousand bits. Hey, Jerma, watch this. They forgot the link. This is not how this works.
[27238.10s -> 27245.34s]  Okay. Well, I expect it. Nice.
[27246.50s -> 27248.50s]  Thank you for the $15.
[27255.06s -> 27259.24s]  What the hell. Okay. All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[27260.28s -> 27266.68s]  Starting pretty much around the same time. We're gonna start with that jumpscare mansion game and however long I can stand that game,
[27267.32s -> 27269.50s]  we're gonna move on to
[27269.74s -> 27273.34s]  Darkwood again. Take care. Good night. Goodbye.
[27274.38s -> 27283.54s]  Why did I do that? I didn't even do change the scenes. I am so stupid. I'm terrible at this.
[27284.10s -> 27286.10s]  I gotta get better at that.
[27286.10s -> 27289.78s]  Anyways, good night. See you tomorrow guys. Take care. I just love you.
