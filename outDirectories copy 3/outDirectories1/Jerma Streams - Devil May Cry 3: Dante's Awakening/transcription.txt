[32.12s -> 48.52s]  I like this comment. Where is this fucking guy? I'm right here. How are you doing? Time to start
[48.52s -> 62.95s]  meowing. I'm good. I'm good. That's the quickest way to be like, no, no, I'm not doing that.
[63.85s -> 79.94s]  I'm good. Let me tweet. So you probably saw the title. Maybe you were here in the pre stream,
[81.34s -> 88.95s]  but we're going to go over very briefly what happened in the chat because I know that there
[89.51s -> 98.33s]  are like 15 games in this series and I'm starting with Devil May Cry 3. The big debate in pre stream
[98.33s -> 110.87s]  council has chosen. They actually chose five, but I vetoed it. Turned out that starting with three
[112.25s -> 125.08s]  was considered by most people the right call. The smart thing to do. Three and five are one
[125.88s -> 132.87s]  storyline and then one, two, one and two are the same story or one, two, four and then three,
[132.87s -> 144.52s]  five. Is it, is it work like Star Wars? Like how does this work? It's four and five. It goes three,
[144.52s -> 154.98s]  one, two, four, five. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, I was thinking, do I start with one or do I start with
[154.98s -> 160.55s]  three? I was told start with three. I don't know how to do this shit anymore.
[160.71s -> 166.63s]  It's like, if you've never seen Star Wars, like how would you, how about, okay, wait, wait, wait,
[166.63s -> 171.27s]  wait, this is a better idea. How would you tell people to start Resident Evil? We're going to
[171.27s -> 178.89s]  talk about this. Resident Evil, Resident Evil. Do you have people start with the new ones?
[179.61s -> 185.61s]  Do you start with seven, eight, do the whole Ethan story? Do you start at one? I don't know
[185.61s -> 191.58s]  if I would recommend starting at one. Do, are you even into that? Would you do seven, eight,
[192.46s -> 199.58s]  then one, two, remake two or one, two normally? There's a couple of remakes in Devil May Cry,
[199.58s -> 208.60s]  right? And do you even put the other Resident Evil games on that list? It's like, it's Code
[208.60s -> 214.46s]  Veronica on that list, for instance, in like the play one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[215.90s -> 222.44s]  Yes or no. That's why it gets tricky. There are five games in this series and there's multiple
[222.44s -> 231.83s]  timelines and storylines. So I get it. It's tough. So we're starting with three. You guys
[231.83s -> 238.15s]  ready? Devil May Cry, I didn't even do my tweet. Today's going to be a chill stream.
[238.15s -> 248.34s]  Just want to hang out and play, relax and have a nice evening together. Is this game hard?
[248.98s -> 263.14s]  When this game's hard, are they just like fun? Not really. The gameplay is the real content.
[264.50s -> 274.79s]  Yeah, let's just hang out. Somebody said wait, Code Veronica is shit. Resident Evil, I am
[274.79s -> 282.07s]  and look, I am a Resident Evil streamer. I am. I played, I've played all the Resident Evil games,
[282.07s -> 287.05s]  all of them. But I will agree that the Resident Evil is an interesting franchise because
[287.77s -> 295.69s]  they're one of the only franchises that has that main series, which is phenomenal. And then a ton
[295.69s -> 309.26s]  of kind of bargain bin straight to DVD movies that they also have. I swear I see a Resident
[309.26s -> 314.94s]  Evil property come out every couple of years and I just feel like it's go, it's right into
[314.94s -> 325.53s]  the bargain bin. Is that accurate? And then they got Resident Evil 4 remake comes out.
[325.53s -> 330.10s]  One of the best games I've played. I mean, that's absolutely one of the best games I've played this
[330.10s -> 336.31s]  year without a doubt. Resident Evil 2's remake. Favorite game of the fucking whole year when it
[336.31s -> 345.86s]  came out. Resident Evil 7 and 8. I really liked those. I thought they were good. Why are you
[345.86s -> 353.77s]  stalling? There's no stalling. I'm just hanging out. You've played like four games this year.
[354.41s -> 358.81s]  No, how many games have I played this year? I want to know. How many games have I played this year
[358.81s -> 366.58s]  on stream? All right, let me, I'm going to give you guys a little bit of a bet.
[367.74s -> 376.54s]  Do you think I have played more than 15 games this year? Yes, I have. Do you think it's all right?
[376.54s -> 380.46s]  We need to, nobody look yet. We need to vote first. A one minute poll. Quick before people,
[380.46s -> 383.34s]  it's going to take like five minutes to do this research. So we need to poll right now.
[384.06s -> 393.56s]  Have I played more than 20 games this year? Have I played more than 20 games this year? Yes or no?
[395.34s -> 401.61s]  It's literally one minute poll going up right now. Have I played more than 20 games since January
[401.61s -> 414.78s]  1st, 2023? 20 different individual games. No shot. 15 yes, 20 no. Well, let's find out.
[415.50s -> 418.78s]  All right. So there's a lot of people that don't think I've, how many, are you serious? How many
[418.78s -> 433.83s]  times have I streamed this year? Shut the fuck up. BNAF trailer. What? All right. All right. All
[433.83s -> 439.99s]  right. So 70% of you think I have not played 20 different video games this year. How many is it?
[440.55s -> 447.83s]  Somebody's doing it right now. Somebody was already on it. Jesus. Sorry. This is not the
[447.83s -> 455.29s]  Switch version. This is, this is the PC version on Steam or the HD collection. You've played 19
[455.29s -> 467.85s]  games this year. No, that's not true. And do we count the Xbox and PlayStation nights where I've
[467.85s -> 473.05s]  played like 40 games in three nights? Those, do those count? Those, I don't think those count.
[474.44s -> 479.08s]  I think those are all part of one collective kind of group of game, right? I don't think those count.
[479.80s -> 485.19s]  I'm talking like it's a stream. It's a, it's an individual stream of this game that I'm playing
[485.99s -> 490.71s]  regardless of if I play it more than once. Like how many actual individual games have come out
[490.71s -> 494.79s]  that we're not part of a, I'm going to play this Xbox game for 15 minutes and move on.
[495.51s -> 518.36s]  Is it actually 19? It says 31. 31. Let's go. Yeah. 31. I've played 31 games in 2023.
[521.06s -> 529.83s]  Is this the fifth month? What is that per month? That's a lot. That's a lot. 31 divided by,
[534.22s -> 541.59s]  Hey, that's five games a month. I've played, I've played five games a month on average,
[541.59s -> 560.73s]  five different games a month. It's six games a month. Whatever. That's fake one per week. Yeah.
[561.37s -> 571.42s]  What's wrong with that? Generous math. I'm good. Watch the FNAF trailer. I'll tell you,
[571.42s -> 574.86s]  I already know what happens in the FNAF trailer. It's going to start on a close-up of a phone.
[575.82s -> 581.14s]  It's going to be pitch black and you're going to hear a phone ringing and it's going to go like,
[586.81s -> 588.65s]  and then it's going to cut. It's going to fade to black and then,
[588.65s -> 593.14s]  and then white text is going to show up. You remember taking the first call
[595.77s -> 600.57s]  back on the phone. And we're very close by the way, we're literally zoomed in on the receiver
[607.42s -> 612.54s]  and then it fades out again, white text, but will you be there for the last call?
[613.34s -> 618.46s]  And then it fades in. We're in an office and it's,
[618.46s -> 622.54s]  it's some fucking A-list celebrity is on the phone and they're doing the,
[622.54s -> 629.11s]  hello. Oh, hello. Hello. And we're talking like an S tier celebrity. I don't know who it would be
[632.06s -> 638.71s]  like, Oh, Wally, are you kidding me? It's, it's Chris Pratt. He's the hello guy, right? It's
[638.71s -> 652.82s]  going to be an A-list celebrity. None of this happens. I don't, I don't want to watch the FNAF
[652.82s -> 657.86s]  trailer. All right. I will, I will privately right now watch the first 10 seconds of the
[657.86s -> 666.28s]  FNAF trailer and I'll let you know my thoughts. All right. Here we go. I'm privately going to
[666.28s -> 671.13s]  watch it on my own right here. Five nights at Freddy's. Here it comes. Okay. Here we go.
[671.13s -> 685.43s]  All right. You're tired of having the same old backyard birthday party for your child every year.
[688.87s -> 694.39s]  So I was wrong. I was very wrong. It should have been zoom in on the phone pitch black.
[695.11s -> 701.16s]  You were there for the first phone call. I would have hit so much harder.
[712.12s -> 723.18s]  Fake trailer. Wait, that's not even the real trailer. Wait, what? This is the official one.
[734.60s -> 743.16s]  All right. Show it. I have to press like two extra buttons to show it.
[743.32s -> 753.05s]  Yeah. All right. Fine. We'll watch it. I can, I can, I can, no, I can watch this, right? It's a
[753.05s -> 765.40s]  fucking trailer. All right. Let's watch it. All right. Let's watch it. Let's watch it. Spoilers.
[765.40s -> 770.07s]  It's the trailer for the movie. We're going to watch the trailer for five nights at Freddy's
[770.07s -> 792.07s]  right now. Okay. Cause we care so much about this apparently. Five nights at Freddy's. All right.
[792.07s -> 804.94s]  I'll give you my thoughts. Show your face. No, I can't. I don't, I just can't today. I just can't
[804.94s -> 812.34s]  today. All right. Holland, you just messed with me. All right. Let's see how this is.
[812.98s -> 821.37s]  It's like 40 seconds long. Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. Yeah. Where fantasy and fun
[821.37s -> 832.84s]  come to life. Hit it guys. If you're watching this video means you've been selected as Freddy's
[832.84s -> 843.46s]  newest security guard. Hello. We're going to have so much fun together.
[843.46s -> 875.77s]  I mean, it's just, I don't know. I mean, if it's a 40 second trailer, I don't know what I can't tell
[875.77s -> 888.07s]  from what's going on here. I mean, is it, is it, is it going to, is it, I don't know. Is it like a
[889.32s -> 901.38s]  good movie? I don't know. I haven't seen it. They didn't do the trailer that I wanted though.
[901.38s -> 905.98s]  You're stalling so bad. I'm not even stalling. It's been 15 minutes.
[906.94s -> 913.21s]  We just watched the Five Nights at Freddy's theatrical trailer. Is that stalling or is that
[913.21s -> 929.96s]  wow, current thing to talk about? We just installed this. Okay. No more stalling. I'm ready.
[929.96s -> 940.84s]  You couldn't give a rat's ass about Five Nights at Freddy's. I mean, okay, there's going to be,
[940.84s -> 947.66s]  I feel like we already know the whole thing. Five Nights at Freddy's has a pretty,
[949.18s -> 954.71s]  very elaborate lore. I'm not concerned about runtime. Why am I even giving you my thoughts
[954.79s -> 966.79s]  on this? All right. Time to play Devil May Cry. Turn this up. All right. I said Five Nights at
[966.79s -> 977.02s]  Freddy's three. That's what we're doing tonight. Let's go. What a centrist take. I'm not going to
[977.02s -> 982.36s]  see that movie. Can I tell you, I can tell you that, right? I'm not going to see Five Nights at
[982.36s -> 989.48s]  Freddy's. I'm not going to see it. I won't watch it ever. This is never happening. I'm just telling
[989.48s -> 993.48s]  you that I'm not going to see the movie. Is it going to be fine? Maybe it'll be cool. Maybe
[993.48s -> 1000.25s]  you'll like it. I'm not, I probably won't watch it because I still haven't even seen the Mario movie.
[1002.06s -> 1006.26s]  Do you think I'm going to be rushing to the theater to go see Five Nights at Freddy's?
[1006.26s -> 1015.96s]  I still have to, what do you, what does this mean? That's where it's fucked up, dude.
[1015.96s -> 1021.14s]  You're a lazy movie watcher. All right. Wait, what's, what does this mean? Gold or yellow?
[1021.14s -> 1030.81s]  What does it mean? Gold is continue. Yellow is restart level. Uh, I'm going to go with this one
[1030.81s -> 1044.95s]  then. I like that a lot. I'm a big fan of that. Go on. You've heard of it, haven't you? The legend
[1044.95s -> 1053.13s]  of Sparta. When I was young, my father would tell me stories about it. In ancient times,
[1053.77s -> 1060.49s]  a demon rebelled against his own kind for the sake of the human race. With his sword, he shut
[1060.49s -> 1066.97s]  the portal to the demonic realm and sealed the evil entities off from our human world. But since
[1066.97s -> 1074.58s]  he was a demon himself, his power was also trapped on the other side. I keep thinking of some
[1074.58s -> 1083.94s]  celebrity doing that. Hello. Oh, and, and, uh, it's gotta be a soundtrack by Danny Elfman. You
[1083.94s -> 1101.37s]  know what I mean? You were there for the first call. Give me the reins. I'll fucking make it
[1101.37s -> 1168.02s]  happen. Yeah. See, they get it. They know. Look at this. They knew what they were doing. They know
[1168.02s -> 1174.26s]  how to make fucking media close up on the fucking phone. Black pitch black coming up from black.
[1174.26s -> 1188.97s]  We're on the same wavelength. Sorry for business yet. It's a little quiet. I'll turn it up in a
[1188.97s -> 1204.39s]  minute. I haven't even picked a name for this joint and I'm already you a customer too.
[1207.34s -> 1215.08s]  Well, if you want to use the bathroom, help yourself. The toilets in the back is your name.
[1215.08s -> 1229.43s]  Dante, son of Sparta. What did you hear that from your brother? He's got a small head.
[1232.78s -> 1248.41s]  Yeah, whatever. Who cares? Accept it. I don't think you want to mess with me, man. I can
[1248.41s -> 1275.70s]  X, X, X, X, X, X, Y, Y, Y, Y, B, B, X, X, X, X, X, Y, Y, Y, Y, B, B better than anybody you know.
[1275.70s -> 1290.02s]  What is going on? He's got stuff sticking out of him. Okay.
[1299.46s -> 1329.13s]  Man, it is really quiet. I'll turn it up. I'm sorry. Oh, now it's not quiet. What was that?
[1351.56s -> 1373.58s]  Why is he doing like, all right, tutorial time. This is okay. Select
[1374.06s -> 1378.94s]  from four basic styles. Use your select style action to show the enemies just how crazy this
[1378.94s -> 1387.50s]  party can get. So you pick from gunslinger, royal guard, trickster, or sword master and B
[1387.50s -> 1396.47s]  is your style attack. Okay. You feed enough enemies and eventually your style will level up
[1396.47s -> 1403.42s]  and you knew in wonderful style actions. So you have to play with a style to be able to level up
[1403.42s -> 1411.26s]  that style. Or do I actually do I have to pick one of these? I've seen a lot of people in chat here.
[1411.26s -> 1417.37s]  Okay. Hold on. You will master a new style action every time your style advances. Okay.
[1418.25s -> 1425.53s]  Gain experience points by defeating enemies. Change styles mid game via the mission start
[1425.53s -> 1430.90s]  screen. Okay. So you got to stick with something for a little while. You will begin the game with
[1430.90s -> 1446.04s]  the trickster style pre-selected. Okay. Mission one, crazy party. Customize. Whoa. I did not know
[1446.04s -> 1455.77s]  there was all this. So these are my weapons. I think I only have these. That's it. All right.
[1455.77s -> 1464.98s]  Style. Let me read these information. Uh, allows player to avoid enemy attacks using special.
[1464.98s -> 1468.26s]  Okay. So this is probably a dodge role, which is, I think I'm probably going to pick that one.
[1470.10s -> 1475.78s]  Master different melee weapons and maximize each weapon's power. I like that too. I'm not going to
[1475.78s -> 1480.26s]  look at chat right now because I know you're telling me the meta. You're probably saying,
[1480.26s -> 1484.18s]  Hey dude, royal guard is literally don't do anything else, but I want to ruin my playthrough
[1484.18s -> 1489.56s]  before I look over here. So let's do it. Gunslinger. They're going to master different
[1489.56s -> 1496.17s]  guns. I like that. I like that. Royal guard minimizing the damage of an enemy attack.
[1496.17s -> 1506.94s]  All right. So this is defense, defense, ranged DPS, melee DPS and sort of like rogue kind of
[1506.94s -> 1515.80s]  survivability. So do I want to be like quick, quick, quick, quick fight, fight, shoot, shoot
[1515.80s -> 1529.59s]  or defend? I feel like I want to pick this one because I, I didn't, when I think of devil may
[1529.59s -> 1534.95s]  cry, and this might be a different, I'm thinking of a different game. Maybe when I think of devil
[1534.95s -> 1541.14s]  may cry, I've never played it, but I think of two pistols or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1541.14s -> 1545.62s]  Then holding them behind my head. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Then one forward and one behind
[1545.62s -> 1549.62s]  my head. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang spinning around. Both those guns are behind my head.
[1549.62s -> 1554.22s]  I'm not looking bang, bang, bang, bang. That's kind of, and that's what I'm thinking of.
[1554.22s -> 1573.78s]  That's Bayonetta. Well, why am I playing this? I'll try it. Go for it. All right. Master the true
[1573.78s -> 1584.76s]  power of Dante. So that's lock on, melee, style action, examine, shoot. All right. These two,
[1585.48s -> 1593.18s]  this is a special move and then jump. Character move is a taunt. Old right bumper, then press
[1593.18s -> 1603.38s]  left stick to change lock on targets. All right. Good to know. Yeah, that this is what I'm thinking
[1603.38s -> 1609.90s]  of. Okay. Red orb, a magic red stone of crystallized demon blood offered to the gods to earn new power.
[1610.86s -> 1620.07s]  And is this just, can I mash? No, no, not good enough. Try mash as fast as I can.
[1620.63s -> 1629.98s]  Act different depending on the time. Oh, here we go. This is explaining to me. No, so why, why, why,
[1629.98s -> 1640.89s]  why, why, why, repeatedly press X to rapidly fire press X while jumping. Okay. So it's like, why,
[1640.89s -> 1661.18s]  why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why. I got an A. All right. I get it.
[1664.68s -> 1676.94s]  Is that it? Good job. I just got S. Oh, I need to lock on. Oh, it's hold lock on. Okay. Okay.
[1677.50s -> 1685.51s]  I feel like I'm going to like this game. I feel like I'm going to like it. Current enemy you are
[1685.51s -> 1692.97s]  locked on to will be displayed with a cursor and change the target with left stick. Taunting
[1692.97s -> 1701.98s]  increases the meter. Ooh, that's what I figured. So if you hold, okay. So that's to get to the
[1701.98s -> 1740.63s]  closest enemy. Okay. I was seeing how long I could do that. So what's wrong with Devil May Cry 2?
[1740.63s -> 1770.22s]  Why does everybody hate it? Oh, wait, that's like a style move. Ooh. All right. I'm trying to figure
[1770.22s -> 1775.42s]  out the lock on. So if I lock on to somebody, how do I, do I, oh, I have to click the stick in. Okay.
[1775.42s -> 1786.34s]  I get it. And it just goes to the nearest. I got it. Okay. Magic green stone of crystallized
[1786.34s -> 1800.97s]  demon essence. It require, it returns lost life. I'll take a C. That's fine. I didn't turn it up.
[1800.97s -> 1848.54s]  Sorry. It's terrible gameplay and story. The characters are all fucked. Oh, you ruined it.
[1848.62s -> 1858.66s]  Yeah. All right. All right. I didn't even know about the style points.
[1858.66s -> 1873.69s]  That's a B. B-A-B. B-A-B. B-A-B-I-B-O-O-B-I-B-I. Isn't that the three stooges?
[1882.09s -> 1904.47s]  Okay. I did not turn it up yet. I will right now. I promise. Did the graphics get better
[1904.47s -> 1915.64s]  after leaving that house? My shop, you're going to pay for that.
[1924.33s -> 1927.61s]  I almost wish he took an extra like five seconds to put that on her. 10 seconds.
[1928.01s -> 1960.70s]  Turn it up. I'm sorry. I got it. Okay. Blast the enemy into the air. Hold right bumper and press
[1960.70s -> 1969.05s]  Y while holding the left stick back. So this certain does different moves. It's not just Y,
[1969.05s -> 1974.01s]  Y, Y, Y, Y, B, B, B, B, B, B. You have to do certain combos. It's like playing Street Fighter.
[1974.65s -> 2005.56s]  Okay. Is that better? That's better, right? Are we happy with this? So hold Y. How come it doesn't
[2005.56s -> 2019.32s]  work? I'm holding Y. Hold Y. Oh, and you have to hit back. Oh, shit. Right. Ah, there it is.
[2026.49s -> 2065.43s]  Ooh. All right. Ooh, that was cool. Oops.
[2070.66s -> 2075.13s]  I don't know why I just thought this was funny. I don't know why my brain just thought that I
[2075.13s -> 2087.88s]  was going to uninstall the game. Imagine uninstall the game was in the menu and it was one down from
[2087.96s -> 2096.82s]  resume game. Oh, thank God. All right. There is a dodge roll. I was going to say I've been,
[2096.82s -> 2105.38s]  I'm missing it. What the fuck are you saying, bro? I don't know. I think that'd be humorous.
[2110.90s -> 2114.42s]  All right. So there is a dodge roll. Thank goodness. I was going to say I didn't,
[2114.42s -> 2116.82s]  there wasn't one. I was going to be very, very unhappy about it.
[2117.54s -> 2175.75s]  Get this thing out of here. Am I doing bad? Yeah. A little. Am I doing, I,
[2178.55s -> 2223.94s]  ooh, boss fight versus death. Wow. What is that? Ooh. Oh shit. All right. Let's go.
[2225.38s -> 2228.10s]  I gotta get used to the game. I gotta get used to the controls.
[2236.12s -> 2273.88s]  I just, I just downloaded it 15 minutes ago. It's better. This is going better. I'll tell you one
[2273.88s -> 2279.80s]  thing that's kind of crossing me up is having to hold right bumper to dodge. I'm not used to that
[2279.80s -> 2286.46s]  and my brain pressing B or A dodges always. That's going to take at least an hour or five
[2286.46s -> 2312.78s]  to get used to. Nope. All right. Let's go. Okay. I'm going to fight death again. We're still alive.
[2313.99s -> 2340.22s]  Oh, this idiot. Is it healing? Fuck. I'm not going to be able to beat this guy.
[2349.72s -> 2374.42s]  Do I get any gunslinger moves? I have no help. Yeah. Click left to change lock on.
[2374.42s -> 2379.90s]  Hi guys. I'm a from software Andy. You know, like I, every video game has to be played like
[2379.90s -> 2388.84s]  from software games or I can't play them. Like B is not dodge. I lose. I mean, there's no
[2388.84s -> 2400.33s]  estus flask. I can do with X. I can't play it. It's over. This game's not for old people. I got it
[2400.33s -> 2415.48s]  right here. Let me just open your inventory. How do I do that? How do I open my inventory?
[2420.79s -> 2430.89s]  How do I open my inventory? It's E? No, I'm on a controller. Oh my God. I'm dead. This gets hard.
[2431.69s -> 2446.09s]  All right. This is a hard game. Oh, it's down on the D pad. All right. Okay. This is a hard game.
[2446.73s -> 2458.36s]  Is everybody laughing? Cause I picked gunslinger. Is that what, is that what I did wrong?
[2466.71s -> 2483.66s]  Well, all right. I'll try it one more time with gunslinger. Starting out with gunslinger is hard.
[2483.66s -> 2496.14s]  All right. Well, I'll try it one more time. Level one gunslinger is bad. Okay. All right. I'll
[2496.14s -> 2534.10s]  change it if I, if I can't do it this time, you should be jumping way more neutral. Trump has
[2534.10s -> 2538.38s]  more iframes than your dodge roll. And where are the iframes? Are they at the very beginning or
[2538.38s -> 2576.26s]  the end of the middle? Where they at? Fuck. All right. I got half health. Is there a sprint?
[2576.42s -> 2592.04s]  How do I run? How do I move faster? Use trickster please. All right. This is my last try with this
[2594.04s -> 2613.96s]  All right. I got it. God damn it. That was quick. Oh my God. He's going to kill me again. I'm in
[2613.96s -> 2619.56s]  the tutorial. Is this game really? Okay. Wait, can I ask a question? Is this game really, really
[2619.56s -> 2640.55s]  fucking hard? Is it supposed to be this hard? He's going to go, dude. People got rocked by this boss
[2640.55s -> 2645.99s]  back in the day. I mean, this guy's, this guy's no joke. This game is, don't put that on screen.
[2645.99s -> 2654.06s]  Don't put that on stream and ruin my life. It's already there. Okay. Don't put that on. Okay.
[2658.31s -> 2668.15s]  Damn, this is hard. Okay. All right. Let me, how do I, how do I make it so I can, what's my style?
[2675.48s -> 2686.71s]  I'm not doing anything flashy. I'm just going to try to stay alive. I don't care if I get a D.
[2686.71s -> 2698.18s]  I just, I want to just beat it. Shit. I had to, I almost want to remap the dodge to just be like A.
[2699.22s -> 2715.24s]  That's the thing that's causing me the most problems right now. What did I just do?
[2715.80s -> 2729.34s]  Is there a way to move the camera quickly so I can actually see who I'm fighting?
[2729.34s -> 2740.90s]  This has got to be like a camera, like three position, right? All right. That didn't go as bad.
[2741.46s -> 2762.01s]  I'm learning. All right. I'm back at full hope. Oh, that's how you do that. All right. That's fun.
[2762.65s -> 2794.09s]  I got it immediately to see. All right. Bosses. Here's the boss. Let's go.
[2795.13s -> 2805.56s]  Enemies off camera. Won't. Oh, this guy's still alive. All right. Let's go. This is the one. This
[2805.56s -> 2816.52s]  is the one right here. Rickster literally has a dodge on B. Please. I gotta, I gotta beat this
[2816.52s -> 2864.57s]  guy. Dives and then jump. Oh my God. I'm like kind of parrying somehow. Oh, fuck that. Come on, man.
[2865.37s -> 2888.78s]  Shit. What? I'm missing something here. I definitely tell you, if I got this game,
[2889.90s -> 2905.83s]  I would have cried and returned it. I would have cried. I would have cried. And you're like,
[2905.83s -> 2916.70s]  Hey, don't get it. Wait, is this game M? What is this rated? What is the game rated? Is this M?
[2917.66s -> 2948.78s]  I probably still would have cried and returned it. Yeah. Cry. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hold on. Wait, I'm
[2948.78s -> 2958.42s]  getting some tips here. You can ride enemies. My worst fears of how a DMC stream would go are
[2958.42s -> 2964.73s]  coming true. They'll switch to Mario in no time. This is much harder than I thought it was going
[2964.73s -> 2972.70s]  to be. Well, okay. Hard is not necessarily the answer to the question. It's needing to have the
[2972.70s -> 3003.98s]  controls mastered in the first five minutes. Come on, Gwen. What's going on here? This is
[3003.98s -> 3009.08s]  probably the hardest Devil May Cry game. I'm all for it. I know I'm all for it. I'm,
[3009.08s -> 3013.38s]  I just got to learn how to play the game. Well, I beat millennia. That doesn't matter.
[3014.18s -> 3045.53s]  I win every argument, but you use teach. You use teach. It doesn't matter. I don't care. All
[3045.53s -> 3051.11s]  right, let's go. I'm going to be the tutorial boss. I promise. I'll be the tutorial. I will.
[3051.83s -> 3061.86s]  The original version is considered the hardest. I mean, I like a challenge. Let's go put it on
[3061.86s -> 3077.18s]  easy mode. No, I got it right here. Watch this. I got it. Where are the iframes? Where are the
[3077.18s -> 3105.69s]  iframes? How do I fucking dodge? Where are the iframes? God damn it. This is so fucking hard.
[3110.95s -> 3122.82s]  Okay, we're going to, I'm going to, can I, can I do it from the menu? How do I do this? How do I
[3122.82s -> 3131.66s]  pick the one that's not horrible? Which one is it? Gunslinger. I picked gunslinger and I was
[3131.66s -> 3145.32s]  getting fucking destroyed. Can I do it from here? Do I have to do a new game? You can't rely on
[3145.32s -> 3167.06s]  iframes. I can from here? Oh, here we go. Okay. So normal to, wait, what's going on?
[3168.31s -> 3182.79s]  Demo digest? I'm confused. What is this menu? All right. So this didn't work out that well.
[3185.35s -> 3200.81s]  Trickster. I'll try trickster. Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. Vital Star S. Is this a heal?
[3203.69s -> 3211.51s]  I should buy this, right? Don't buy these. Okay. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. Trickster.
[3212.47s -> 3223.86s]  So what can trickster do? We, I learned that. Oh my God. Way better. I, I, the movement is so
[3223.86s -> 3231.69s]  much more fluid and there's no longer an input delay on every single button. I was pressing
[3231.69s -> 3235.45s]  Y and it would be Y and then the movement happened about two to three seconds later.
[3236.25s -> 3242.44s]  Holy shit. This is way better. Yeah. I would hit Y to swing in three seconds with the Y. What an
[3242.44s -> 3288.58s]  input delay that was. That is hard mode. Thanks for letting me know. I love that move. Very cool.
[3291.08s -> 3296.36s]  Oh, there is a dodge roll. Yeah. It's so much better. This is way better. This is way more how
[3296.36s -> 3309.14s]  I want to actually play this video game. We're good. There it is. So this is a side roll and
[3309.14s -> 3323.26s]  then a jump back. I know that. And now I have this. All right. How much copium is it going to take
[3323.26s -> 3355.66s]  for me to get killed in the first 10 seconds of the tutorial bus? I wonder. Oh, come on. All
[3355.66s -> 3380.76s]  right. I just got this. That's a heal. All right. Come on. Let's go. No more fucking around. All
[3380.76s -> 3427.64s]  right. That's so much better. What was the eye frames? Oh, what's my menu? How do I take that
[3427.64s -> 3478.55s]  heal? Where's my heal up on the D pad? Got it. OK. I'm good. I'm good. I get it now. The dodge
[3478.55s -> 3505.64s]  roll changes the whole game. Why is everybody calling me DMC to Andy? What's that? DMC to is
[3505.64s -> 3521.21s]  all about your guns. Should have started with that one. DMC to sucks, dude. All right. That was
[3521.21s -> 3555.32s]  cool. I get it. Nearly a year since we last met. Where does the time go dressed like Dante for
[3555.32s -> 3567.42s]  Halloween? You could always tell, you know, who's been going to the gym lately by their Halloween
[3567.42s -> 3584.09s]  costume. Dante from Devil May Cry is like I've been going to the gym lately. I can fill out this
[3584.17s -> 3601.93s]  shirt. It's all right. Hey, I think that's fine. I'm super bad with time management.
[3602.49s -> 3609.14s]  I'm really good with my orbs. I'm not that stylish, but not super bad. I mean, the clothes I wear
[3609.14s -> 3614.66s]  fine. I don't do very much damage, but I will eat all of your food. I'll use all the stuff in your
[3614.66s -> 3623.02s]  house. I mean, that's like, I think that's pretty accurate to me. I don't know what orbs is. Is that
[3623.02s -> 3632.28s]  my brain? That's like how good, how strong my brain power is. That's the big orb in the middle
[3632.28s -> 3656.47s]  of my skull. Orbs is collectibles. Oh, OK. Orbs is money. Doesn't it excite you that Timon and
[3656.47s -> 3670.73s]  Negru once ruled this earth as the medium between the human world? Isn't it a magnificent view?
[3672.18s -> 3679.06s]  Greatest minds of their time, those who revered evil constructed this glorious edifice.
[3680.02s -> 3687.24s]  Now, after two millenniums of confinement, it can at last fulfill the purpose for which it was
[3687.24s -> 3700.54s]  intended. That's none of my concern, did he? Of course, he's taking good care of it. After all,
[3700.54s -> 3708.87s]  I don't know who this is. It is the only memento left from him. He has no idea if it's true.
[3708.87s -> 3713.67s]  Oh, I got an unbelievable video idea. And I don't want to say it because I don't want anyone to
[3713.67s -> 3747.38s]  steal it. I'm telling you, you guys are going to like this a lot. I might just put it on the
[3747.38s -> 3751.54s]  main channel because I don't know. I feel like it's going to it's going to annoy a lot of people
[3751.54s -> 3756.86s]  because this would be the first video I've uploaded. But I feel like it would be funny.
[3780.23s -> 3789.16s]  Cool. All right. But trickster is going fine. There's no way I can take it off trickster
[3789.80s -> 3805.13s]  because it's just not going to happen. Royal guard gets a block. That sounds awesome. I
[3805.13s -> 3810.84s]  might check it out. I'm all about defense and not taking damage when I play games like this.
[3812.25s -> 3817.53s]  I'm two times as high as normal by pushing off of certain surfaces so you can wall jump.
[3818.49s -> 3865.64s]  That's kind of cool. Oh, and you can jump off. My goodness. Oh, okay. I got it. I got it. It's
[3865.64s -> 3882.39s]  fine. I'm sorry. I'm getting too caught up in trying to do like combos and not surviving.
[3882.39s -> 3918.52s]  Just survive. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. Do attack, wait, attack, attack. That right.
[3918.52s -> 3936.82s]  Because it's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I didn't learn that. They didn't teach me
[3936.82s -> 3962.38s]  that. That's cool. That was a cool move. Okay. Any secrets or anything I should know about? New
[3962.38s -> 3971.75s]  gun. There are two types of sealed doors, red and blue. Release the door sealed by solving a puzzle
[3971.75s -> 3979.72s]  located in that room or defeat all the enemies. So red and blue. Blue is puzzle, red is. Okay.
[3980.52s -> 4022.55s]  Devil may cry three. Dante's Inferno. Yep. Things are breakable. What is this? I can remember
[4022.55s -> 4035.06s]  everybody saying scorn. I've been trying to figure that out for like the last year. Shotgun. Cool.
[4035.06s -> 4041.96s]  I definitely want that. Forget about the two pistols. Switch guns with left trigger in real
[4041.96s -> 4060.42s]  time. I'm going to like this way more. You're a fucking liar. What? Don't accuse me of that.
[4061.64s -> 4076.54s]  Lying to somebody. I've never done that before in my life. Oh shit. Oh, I got, I got to bring
[4076.54s -> 4080.62s]  something up. This is really funny. I don't know why I thought about this. Holly and I were talking
[4080.62s -> 4086.01s]  about this. And do you want to, we were talking about what the ultimate Reddit test is. Like the
[4086.01s -> 4094.97s]  ultimate, the ultimate Redditor test. And you guys ready to take it? The ultimate Redditor test.
[4095.53s -> 4105.53s]  Like if you use Reddit, are you ready? Have you seen the Christopher Lee Lord of the Rings
[4105.53s -> 4117.37s]  backstab video? Yes. If the answer is yes. You know, the one where he's like, Oh, what happened
[4117.37s -> 4130.10s]  is the air. If you've seen that video, I've seen that video probably 10 different times on Reddit
[4131.51s -> 4137.30s]  across like a decade. I had to, we were sitting to think about it. I was like, you know what?
[4137.30s -> 4145.27s]  I've seen that video every like a year or two. That video makes the rounds. It's been like a
[4145.27s -> 4169.82s]  decade. He admitted it. He's a Redditor. What about it, bro? What are you doing? I'm talking
[4169.82s -> 4194.86s]  and walking back and forth in the same room. Okay. All right. Stylish rank. I know what that
[4194.86s -> 4207.85s]  means. It means to be better at the game. So don't get, Hey, well, thanks for letting me know.
[4208.65s -> 4236.70s]  All right. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. How come I'm not doing the thing with the swords in front of me
[4236.70s -> 4260.79s]  anymore? One, one, two, tap. What the heck? Dude, just fucking lock in and mash already.
[4264.78s -> 4293.42s]  Good advice. Actually just hit me in the door. I don't know how I did that before. Honestly.
[4293.98s -> 4330.58s]  All right. When no one's looking, why can I do it? Is there a move list somewhere? How do I get to
[4330.58s -> 4363.16s]  it? Library devil arms. Okay. Rebellion combo one. I know that rebellion combo too. I know that
[4363.16s -> 4373.54s]  helm breaker. I know this one. Yeah. I haven't, it hasn't taught me these. Okay. And I've been
[4373.54s -> 4384.36s]  doing that one. Here it is repeatedly press Y while executing a type two combo. So I have to
[4384.36s -> 4397.93s]  mash Y like this. It didn't work. Uh, you have to do it during the second. Okay. I think I got it.
[4397.93s -> 4425.34s]  Let me try it again. Nice. Okay. Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh. Starting to understand the game.
[4425.90s -> 4437.51s]  You know, I have to collect every, I'm, I'm, I, I'm, I'm an orb person, right? I always get a on
[4437.51s -> 4444.01s]  orbs. That's my thing. Your thing could, that's fine. Your thing could be gameplay and can be
[4444.97s -> 4462.33s]  getting S style and shit like that. I get S on orbs. I collect stuff. What's this thing?
[4462.33s -> 4509.32s]  Do I have to do something with this? This is a DPS check. Oh, I got two of those fragments.
[4509.32s -> 4527.43s]  What does this mean? Statue of the omniscient god of time and space. By offering a demon blood,
[4527.43s -> 4534.92s]  one can attain the power of the ancient magic plans. Power up. Exchange orbs for items like
[4534.92s -> 4556.42s]  vital stars. Exchange orbs to learn new moves or power up your guns. Oh, all right. Shit. What is
[4556.50s -> 4563.10s]  this going to do? High speed lunge attack skewers them through the center.
[4567.24s -> 4574.06s]  So you have to be running while you do it. Is this one lightning quick sword swing that
[4574.06s -> 4590.38s]  sends a powerful shock wave. I like that. $10,000. Okay. So this one is I can upgrade it.
[4591.77s -> 4601.53s]  So hold that and forward and then press Y. I feel like I should get some of these.
[4602.09s -> 4613.08s]  I could buy a blue orb. Okay. What do four of these do? I'm going to get a couple of these.
[4613.72s -> 4631.66s]  Is that dumb? I don't know. My new move seems pretty good. Can I combo it?
[4634.79s -> 4650.31s]  Kind of. Ice guardian's chamber. This thing. I think this is probably going to be a boss fight.
[4650.31s -> 4662.06s]  I think how many viewers did you have when you started? Um, it was 70,000 people here.
[4662.06s -> 4665.98s]  I lost like a lot though. People with it. I took, I took a long time with the tutorial,
[4665.98s -> 4677.43s]  so that's all right. All right. Do you mean ever? Cause that's not correct.
[4677.99s -> 4684.52s]  Do you mean like when I first turned the screen on ever? I don't know.
[4687.69s -> 4690.97s]  I came from a different position in the. Hold on.
[4714.90s -> 4729.26s]  Thank you for a walk. Come on, puppy. Let's go. Is there enough silence? Worm. Incident.
[4729.98s -> 4769.10s]  What are you doing? What's that move? Okay. Wow. I think you have to break the ice off the heads.
[4773.83s -> 4783.70s]  What does this happen? You can't even hurt this thing. You got to break the ice off.
[4784.34s -> 4792.17s]  That's very, yeah. See, I can't get close though. That's like death. If I get close.
[4792.17s -> 4825.48s]  I don't know why I'm even trying it. Stop using guns. When I get close, I get scared.
[4825.48s -> 4840.52s]  The guns suck. Stop using them. My theory. Correct, bro.
[4842.52s -> 4853.99s]  Hey, is my theory correct? I need to know his moveset is.
[4895.35s -> 4901.93s]  Devil may cry free in stores at Walmart. Now pre-order for the devil may cry collectors

[5171.14s -> 5181.87s]  Three-sided nunchuck. I'm never using the sword ever again
[5209.46s -> 5229.82s]  Orbs yep, that's me. I collect orbs. Where are they? I lost orbs. What? Would they despawn?
[5229.82s -> 5237.52s]  I was testing my new weapon. They got a figure that you're gonna do that when you get it. Just testing my new moves though
[5238.02s -> 5242.40s]  Are you going to the park? What's the hurt you get an invitation?
[5258.31s -> 5260.31s]  This was the part where I walked out of the theater
[5271.18s -> 5289.74s]  No, I would stay
[5309.83s -> 5311.64s]  Hey
[5311.64s -> 5315.96s]  Look at that
[5315.96s -> 5320.52s]  See for orbs. How that's not even how did I lose out on?
[5321.20s -> 5330.80s]  Did I actually lose out on a lot? It was a lot hum. It was like 2k. Are you kidding me? Bye
[5331.80s -> 5339.72s]  I'm supposed to be the orb guy and I couldn't even do my couldn't even do my job that I'm supposed to be doing
[5339.72s -> 5344.97s]  Oh, that's bad. Oh
[5359.52s -> 5382.77s]  Well, it's okay, how come all my titles have that three face like we mod keeps doing that so I want to know who
[5399.37s -> 5401.69s]  For a second, I thought this guy's clothes were on backwards
[5402.17s -> 5406.56s]  I thought he was wearing a jacket like the other way. No, that's not how I don't know
[5406.56s -> 5412.33s]  Why my brain just thought that for a second. I was like, wait, does he have his shirt? Oh, no, it's like a suit
[5413.05s -> 5430.78s]  Like a all the way up suit. All right. Do I want to change anything?
[5431.38s -> 5443.14s]  How am I still level one trickster? You're like that's I'm gonna be in a mobile game. I don't want to be a level one trickster
[5459.60s -> 5462.70s]  I'm curious
[5462.70s -> 5469.34s]  revolver level two
[5469.58s -> 5471.58s]  Windmill I can do a windmill
[5471.94s -> 5480.37s]  Spin the nunchucks around in a propeller like motion to rapidly slice into the enemy. I like that
[5487.86s -> 5496.04s]  Not enough orbs. Yeah
[5497.16s -> 5499.16s]  Yeah, don't remind me
[5499.20s -> 5511.33s]  I'm alright for now. I'll try this new stance though. This is the PC version. This is the part of the HD collection
[5511.81s -> 5525.51s]  This level is going to take you two hours
[5525.99s -> 5541.52s]  Is he saying that because they just introduced the map system map goes off your surrounding area from an overhead perspective
[5543.26s -> 5549.13s]  Interesting. Okay. It shows a graphical image from the room you currently occupy. Yeah
[5549.65s -> 5552.72s]  Press the d-pad to view the various floors you have visited
[5555.25s -> 5579.00s]  So I get it this is where I am and this is where I'm going I get it I'm Tays inferno
[5580.96s -> 5585.06s]  Redditor wrong game
[5585.82s -> 5608.28s]  Wrong entire series. I don't know why I keep saying that there a double jump. No
[5609.04s -> 5616.32s]  You got to be really just strict with you have to go like, okay
[5626.72s -> 5628.72s]  Okay, this is a lot harder than it looks
[5628.84s -> 5642.96s]  There we go. That's actually a lot harder than it looks. I'm actually kind of surprised. I just did that this door
[5647.00s -> 5672.60s]  Dope Oh
[5672.60s -> 5681.58s]  Red door means enemies Dante press B
[5681.58s -> 5705.07s]  I like the nunchuck during a certain circumstance you can repeatedly press a button to execute a special high-speed combo attack. Yeah
[5705.63s -> 5743.45s]  Okay, so that has to be with the sword. Oh, dude. Yeah, I'll do it. You know, you know, it's not a weapon switch now
[5743.89s -> 5746.07s]  You gotta come back to the stream. He knows what he's doing now
[5746.71s -> 5752.84s]  Bro, I told you I was going to eat dinner like fucking 40 minutes ago. Stop messaging me
[5753.48s -> 5803.34s]  Did you see my last message stop? You just messed up my combo. Where is this person? All right, that's not fair
[5803.34s -> 5822.19s]  They're in a weird spot and I can't change the camera. Everybody else hit hit wall. Hit hit. All right
[5822.67s -> 5842.20s]  That's too advanced for me. Do more static X's. Hey, it was my birthday yesterday. Can you Elmo for me?
[5842.44s -> 5848.61s]  I'm sorry. I have a strict policy where I can only do an Elmo if it's somebody's birthday today
[5848.77s -> 5854.10s]  Right now being with the will of the thunderstorm. I bestow the soul of steel
[5859.68s -> 5861.68s]  I'd do like a magic spell on this one
[5872.12s -> 5879.93s]  So I gotta go up that way
[5880.25s -> 5897.78s]  Not over here. Does the map tell me where I'm currently standing or is that just the room I'm standing in?
[5900.13s -> 5908.36s]  Okay, so that little indicator does not tell me where I'm standing. That's just I thought the little yellow diamond was where I was standing
[5908.36s -> 5913.51s]  So what do I get for doing this?
[5913.55s -> 5917.53s]  Just money and then have to come back and do an electrical spell to that thing
[5946.79s -> 5962.08s]  Okay, this way's too much how can I break these
[5963.01s -> 5980.10s]  Of course I can you think the Lakers are gonna win tonight. I will give you a prediction. I think the
[5980.74s -> 5983.86s]  Lakers are gonna take it
[5984.86s -> 5989.90s]  95 to
[5989.90s -> 5990.82s]  86
[5990.82s -> 6025.06s]  You're gonna lose money if you bet that number. I don't even know what the context but yeah
[6025.42s -> 6031.32s]  Hey, buddy, I don't know if I would do that. I wouldn't take that bet
[6031.96s -> 6034.96s]  We understand this the streamer
[6035.68s -> 6039.28s]  Who hasn't watched a basketball game since he was 14?
[6040.12s -> 6043.43s]  So I told me that's very sad. Oh
[6065.07s -> 6077.80s]  You just ruined everything that was that was really sloppy. I
[6081.04s -> 6082.80s]  Cleaned it up at the end
[6082.80s -> 6111.75s]  That like a parry or something. Let's go. It's a combo extender the orbs
[6112.63s -> 6121.92s]  Who was it Lakers even playing right now?
[6121.92s -> 6141.00s]  I don't even know the answer that question playing Denver. Look at mod for a score update right now. Oh
[6141.72s -> 6146.20s]  It's a hundred and eighteen to 104 Lakers are down right now
[6146.64s -> 6153.69s]  Don't yeah, do not bet that they can't take points away in basketball. Yeah, I'm coming in
[6153.69s -> 6158.00s]  I'm just uh, I want to put a bet down on the game that's going on right now. Sure
[6158.00s -> 6162.32s]  What what can I do for you? Yeah, I get that lake is gonna take it I think 95
[6163.32s -> 6165.91s]  9586 um
[6165.91s -> 6170.36s]  You want you want to take that you bet that's what you're betting right now
[6171.08s -> 6176.75s]  Yeah, it's that Lakers gonna take it sir. I
[6177.47s -> 6179.63s]  I'll take the money
[6179.63s -> 6197.25s]  Um, I can make that jump. What are the odds on that again? It's like guys. I got 15 to 1 20 21
[6197.69s -> 6207.08s]  Well, sir, the odds are that right our zero. That's all right stuff. That's our how fucking still do it. You sell cigarettes here
[6207.34s -> 6230.66s]  I'm gonna fall off this look at my health. What?
[6231.22s -> 6262.62s]  That was annoying. All right, we got a
[6263.26s -> 6266.98s]  Okay, how am I supposed to deal with that?
[6267.18s -> 6302.06s]  Damn, this is horrible. It's horrible
[6302.86s -> 6316.80s]  No, I want to target. I want to customize the controls
[6316.80s -> 6333.89s]  I don't like the pressing in left stick to change kind of annoying to do having to push left stick in to change target
[6333.89s -> 6357.21s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I don't like it. You kill me. I'll be very upset. Okay, we're good
[6369.86s -> 6372.66s]  Off-screen enemies won't initiate attacks. It's a balance
[6373.62s -> 6376.70s]  That's actually really good
[6378.57s -> 6402.01s]  Where am I going I can go up through this door or right back I'm gonna go up right? Oh, man
[6403.01s -> 6405.89s]  We had a boss again. I like that though. I
[6406.73s -> 6408.29s]  Really like that
[6408.29s -> 6411.30s]  Although I really don't like having no help
[6416.05s -> 6428.39s]  How far back is the checkpoint if I lose here? I'm kind of concerned. Is it just that door?
[6428.39s -> 6430.07s]  All right, so don't waste the help
[6430.07s -> 6436.98s]  All right, you got to do it in sections
[6436.98s -> 6444.83s]  We'll go sword for this too. Hey, where's the guy that goes?
[6447.21s -> 6485.03s]  Okay, what do you can I fall down? Oh, I can I thought it was death I want to turn him red
[6485.51s -> 6489.64s]  He's kind of looks like ribs. Yeah. All right, you turn him red
[6490.26s -> 6492.10s]  Then he hides away
[6492.10s -> 6495.48s]  Then go back out
[6495.92s -> 6508.45s]  Okay, so unironically I have to jump on top
[6509.01s -> 6528.37s]  That was good
[6528.37s -> 6542.00s]  unironically
[6542.00s -> 6576.68s]  Shit I missed come on. Sorry. I'll get it. Try the V attacks. Oh shit. I'm Tazin Burnham
[6599.02s -> 6614.06s]  Somebody complained about the refs of the Lakers game in here. All right, this isn't that bad. I think I get it
[6614.14s -> 6618.58s]  Can we do a poll?
[6618.58s -> 6630.18s]  Who do you guys want to win Lakers or Denver? It's definitely gonna be the Lakers, right?
[6631.38s -> 6639.06s]  What's going on right now?
[6643.40s -> 6645.40s]  Things were going really well until
[6645.52s -> 6662.94s]  Five seconds ago. All right. Somebody said they hate this boss now. I understand why
[6663.50s -> 6682.08s]  Where where are you? Yeah, what does this jumper remind me of? It's like it's super sticky
[6683.16s -> 6729.36s]  It's like a straight up straight down. I feel like I weigh seven million pounds. That wasn't bad over here
[6733.66s -> 6754.70s]  I'm gonna heal
[6756.14s -> 6772.52s]  Like most of chat voted for the nuggets because they're hungry do not let these despawn. Oh
[6778.98s -> 6782.58s]  Good a good helping a chicken nuggets. That sounds pretty good
[6787.72s -> 6798.16s]  That was cool. So there's one direction. I didn't go which is this way
[6798.88s -> 6806.57s]  Is it not going the right way? I wish I could tell if I was facing north or south. Try B button on nunchucks
[6807.09s -> 6822.24s]  Seems kind of good
[6822.24s -> 6826.84s]  astronomical board powered by time
[6827.46s -> 6851.93s]  Normally 15 minutes left in the game, right? No, I don't kidding
[6852.45s -> 6856.67s]  Somebody said he wants to stop playing so bad. No, I'm I'm fucking around. I'm having fun
[6875.40s -> 6877.40s]  Your tricks
[6882.04s -> 6884.04s]  Here's that big nose
[6886.68s -> 6890.44s]  Just hear me out you got nothing to lose, right?
[6891.72s -> 6897.16s]  My name is Jester and I know a thing or two about this place
[6897.72s -> 6899.72s]  That thing there
[6899.96s -> 6904.96s]  Is a power generator for this entire sector in order to open
[6905.28s -> 6910.76s]  The door you need to apply a little something. Looks like you and my teeth aren't that nice
[6938.82s -> 6950.56s]  Is what the something is remember that kid write it down on your hand if you don't trust your head
[6959.34s -> 6961.34s]  You
[6961.98s -> 6968.22s]  Guys understand what I have to go through just to brush my teeth in the morning you still piss me off
[6969.18s -> 6983.64s]  That's just how it is
[6984.32s -> 6995.07s]  BBC DS brushes his teeth in the shower. Sometimes you can save a lot of time
[7007.90s -> 7009.58s]  CBD gamer
[7009.58s -> 7036.86s]  Alright, okay. I need to see them all so I'm gonna pick royal guard you save two minutes by brushing your teeth in the shower
[7037.94s -> 7042.34s]  and help
[7042.78s -> 7045.02s]  Don't be humble just take it
[7045.74s -> 7060.25s]  Whatever you've done
[7060.25s -> 7069.64s]  You could see the conclusion of this battle if you pre-ordered devil may try three
[7081.28s -> 7107.26s]  Collectible art booklet included. How do you deal with birds like that? It's like that
[7108.72s -> 7128.84s]  The hell I do it. Oh, I have a different move right?
[7129.96s -> 7138.62s]  My brain has so much trouble with multiple button context menus
[7139.38s -> 7145.06s]  Like holding right bumper and pressing X and then hitting like left trigger and then pressing Y
[7145.86s -> 7156.54s]  And then pressing in left stick and then switching. It's a lot of combinations
[7157.02s -> 7198.60s]  It's a lot of combinations that are just across the whole map. I dodged it the wrong the exact wrong time get over here
[7213.94s -> 7246.45s]  crazy good
[7246.57s -> 7268.57s]  Get that up to a where's that thing old why with the sword launch?
[7271.81s -> 7288.18s]  Came out in 2005 I forget just how old this game really is kind of forget. Wait, I have to fight him
[7288.18s -> 7290.42s]  I thought it was my friend
[7290.74s -> 7343.62s]  God, all right. Watch out for the work shit. I
[7345.10s -> 7373.48s]  Just got that was good. I can't even move
[7382.47s -> 7415.14s]  Watch out shit my name
[7420.74s -> 7448.74s]  Why is it
[7450.74s -> 7460.73s]  Oh
[7461.05s -> 7464.93s]  All right, how do I hear what's he'll what's he'll what's he'll what's he'll what's he'll all right, it's up on the d-pad
[7465.17s -> 7516.63s]  That was a tick-tock. Oh
[7516.63s -> 7523.91s]  So now I'm starting to understand why people like this game so much
[7524.11s -> 7533.79s]  Let me give you my first impression after an hour or two. This game is its bosses
[7533.79s -> 7536.91s]  You just fight a shitload of bosses. Is that correct?
[7537.31s -> 7551.55s]  It's just run down a hallway and fight a few things, but then fight the boss. I like games like that
[7552.17s -> 7572.78s]  I enjoy them. I like fighting against bosses. I can't go this way. Can't jump down you fight a few things and make it look cool
[7574.78s -> 7580.14s]  Where am I going?
[7580.14s -> 7598.70s]  Straight and then straight does that make sense? Is your taunt and your pause the same for some reason?
[7598.70s -> 7604.20s]  Uh, I can answer that so I'm pressing select because in my mind
[7604.52s -> 7607.36s]  See in my brain in my brain. So my brain does this thing in my mind
[7607.44s -> 7612.40s]  They forget about like the sentence that I say for every other sentence
[7613.28s -> 7615.04s]  This is the map
[7615.04s -> 7617.88s]  Like this is come on. I'm trying to press I'm trying to open the map
[7618.40s -> 7632.15s]  Or like a sub menu and then I realize it's start and then in the start menu. He does this thing with his mind
[7635.81s -> 7659.79s]  Get it again. How do I get across this? I can't get across that the orbs here. I didn't get
[7660.39s -> 7679.01s]  Just go it's fine. Oh, we bring it back the just go meme. That's an old one. I remember just go
[7679.37s -> 7711.02s]  That's an old one. Okay
[7711.18s -> 7712.90s]  Is it fall damage?
[7712.90s -> 7742.80s]  All right. I think I want the windmill hold down right bumper plus back and press apply. I
[7743.72s -> 7757.27s]  Don't want to waste too much money
[7757.47s -> 7770.44s]  How many of these do I have? How come I only have two blue orbs didn't I have three?
[7770.44s -> 7777.93s]  I thought I had three fragments. Oh
[7780.87s -> 7798.54s]  I bought a I bought a blue orb. What can I even do with it? Damn it. It's expensive. It's just more health bar. Oh
[7799.54s -> 7805.64s]  Very cool. I'm saving my money. I am gonna buy
[7806.40s -> 7808.77s]  one more of these I
[7808.85s -> 7814.01s]  Know this is so look at how stupid this is now. It's just gonna keep going up
[7814.01s -> 7825.32s]  I know you just spit out your food and you were eating a taco and you just made a mess everywhere. I'm sorry
[7825.92s -> 7836.41s]  You just could not believe what I just did and it fell down and went into the couch. You're sitting on
[7836.93s -> 7842.63s]  Down into like the crevice next to you, which always sucks. It's like, okay, that's food
[7842.63s -> 7846.68s]  I have to go fucking find that and it's gonna take me probably
[7847.20s -> 7851.14s]  20 minutes to get it all cleaned up because it went down into the fucking couch
[7851.94s -> 7856.36s]  Especially with something like lettuce. Oh
[7857.07s -> 7861.07s]  Man, it's gonna stick to something at the bottom of the you're gonna it's gonna be awful. It's like you like an hour
[7861.35s -> 7884.20s]  Okay, I wanted these something else open too. Where was it? I saw it. It was an item right there
[7884.40s -> 7893.93s]  Has this happened to you an ornament, okay
[7899.65s -> 7906.46s]  Has this happened to you? Yes, this happens very frequently and it's always I I
[7908.06s -> 7913.98s]  Eat a lot of meals on the couch. I actually prefer sitting on the couch and eating things like dinner
[7913.98s -> 7921.84s]  I just feel like it's better that way. It's like just I love it. Just like alright, I'm sitting on I got I have a table
[7922.28s -> 7927.62s]  But something about eating just sitting on couch
[7928.26s -> 7932.22s]  Is so good
[7932.50s -> 7934.50s]  I'm missing something here
[7934.50s -> 7943.79s]  What's up that on TV? You give you got a TV there?
[7944.51s -> 7954.62s]  What's the what am I doing now?
[7958.27s -> 7978.69s]  Let me pay attention for a sec. Can I go up there?
[7979.29s -> 7986.39s]  All right, I gotta go up there. Yeah sitting down putting on
[7987.15s -> 7990.72s]  That's what I I will tell you when I talk about
[7990.72s -> 7995.68s]  Oh, yeah, when I watch this other person's stream or I watch the streamer or I watch a YouTube video or a TV show. I
[7996.62s -> 7998.62s]  Wish I was making this up
[8001.18s -> 8003.18s]  I've been eating food
[8003.26s -> 8011.00s]  Every single time I mentioned this I opened up a wall down here. I wasn't it was I picked it up right here
[8011.52s -> 8013.08s]  It was right there
[8013.08s -> 8017.27s]  What does it go though?
[8017.27s -> 8018.94s]  down here
[8018.94s -> 8023.11s]  Like what is this? Wait, I don't know
[8025.10s -> 8026.42s]  blue door
[8026.42s -> 8035.71s]  Didn't I go in the blue door though? Yeah. Hold on
[8036.37s -> 8043.68s]  That's a very weird jump this way. Oh
[8050.58s -> 8062.01s]  I mean, it's alright. It's alright. I don't love it
[8064.09s -> 8080.02s]  Can't say I like it. Are we useful in some places? Yeah, but I'm what I'm saying is every piece of media
[8080.02s -> 8105.46s]  I've ever watched or ever consumed I had food in front of me. What does this do?
[8109.65s -> 8125.38s]  It is actually a parry the parry block. Okay. Oh, yeah, where do I put it in here? I
[8135.74s -> 8138.94s]  Put that somewhere
[8142.94s -> 8144.94s]  This goes up. Oh
[8144.94s -> 8147.26s]  Right. Okay, right, right, right
[8148.10s -> 8164.87s]  For some reason I did not think this had three prongs. I thought it was one. It's a fork man
[8164.87s -> 8167.87s]  Come on, we didn't say Gwen afterwards. So I don't understand what you wrote
[8176.25s -> 8189.30s]  Essence of a powerful and fearless soul eating ice cream while moderating, you know what challenge I'd love to see
[8189.30s -> 8192.78s]  You know, you see speed running no hit speed run fastest time
[8192.78s -> 8197.68s]  I want someone to beat Elden Ring while holding a soft serve ice cream cone
[8198.24s -> 8209.88s]  And they have to like lift the sides and by the way you get points off for all the drips on your hands
[8210.68s -> 8221.60s]  How fast is the Elden Ring speed run right now like 12 minutes? I think you could pull that off a
[8234.24s -> 8237.00s]  new category
[8237.04s -> 8238.68s]  cone percent
[8238.68s -> 8266.64s]  Wait, please have a hair cam. No, no, not tonight. What about a door cam?
[8267.16s -> 8280.89s]  What about one naked cam? No, didn't we talk about one time?
[8281.41s -> 8282.98s]  If
[8282.98s -> 8288.36s]  What was it? It was like what would it be worth if I would have be like scream naked?
[8288.92s -> 8291.92s]  We try to come up with a number. We're not scream, right?
[8291.92s -> 8297.08s]  But like let's say I had like a platform where you could see me naked and I remember people like
[8297.70s -> 8299.14s]  What was this?
[8299.14s -> 8303.79s]  No, I'm not doing this
[8303.79s -> 8309.52s]  I'm just we were making a stupid joke about this a year or two ago and it was
[8309.92s -> 8313.38s]  What how much money would I make doing that?
[8314.64s -> 8327.71s]  Versus anything else and you guys convinced me that it would be insane. I was like, oh
[8328.47s -> 8347.25s]  You got to market it. It's literally free money, dude
[8347.89s -> 8349.01s]  No
[8349.01s -> 8363.51s]  Yeah, I'll do it. It's a free money. Don't how you know, I'll be so funny if you did that. Oh my god
[8363.51s -> 8368.97s]  I'll be wicked funny. Yeah, I'll be laughing my ass off if you did that Jerma
[8370.23s -> 8374.83s]  Please please please please god, please if there is a god, please if there is a god, he'll do it
[8374.99s -> 8377.73s]  Please if there is a god, I know what you're doing
[8378.17s -> 8390.33s]  You don't think I fucking see right through you bullshit. All right. Now, where do I go? I got that soul thing
[8390.69s -> 8405.95s]  Can I go in this door crimson flames twist and dance around the door keeping all would be trespassers at bay
[8406.59s -> 8411.52s]  back to the bridge room
[8411.68s -> 8435.85s]  Bridge room is all the way around. Although can I can I go left? I
[8436.37s -> 8438.37s]  Guess I get a green door
[8461.21s -> 8465.36s]  Do I go I'm this
[8466.12s -> 8476.55s]  Can get that I can get up there I can definitely get up there
[8488.59s -> 8490.59s]  Shit fucking hard
[8490.91s -> 8513.99s]  They wouldn't change the camera angle if you weren't supposed to be over here in a wall jump
[8514.53s -> 8530.38s]  It's kind of hard to do though. I'm honest jump up on the other pipe
[8530.90s -> 8532.90s]  I'm trying
[8555.65s -> 8557.65s]  My whole body wants to just move
[8558.37s -> 8565.64s]  Okay, what I need to go into that little door into that little crevice right there
[8566.22s -> 8573.37s]  It's just so the those of you that played this game. You know how this jump is
[8573.81s -> 8592.14s]  It's like I don't know I can't even describe it. All right, what the hell is that it I got it
[8592.24s -> 8610.00s]  There's nothing else for me here to go to how do I get out of this? Let me see. Yeah, there's nowhere to
[8614.48s -> 8616.48s]  There's another door
[8616.56s -> 8624.51s]  Where's the other door? There's the green one here
[8633.07s -> 8642.38s]  Other side of the fence
[8642.38s -> 8646.28s]  Go to the yellow door. You mean the one in?
[8646.72s -> 8648.72s]  Hold on. I'm getting confused
[8648.76s -> 8651.33s]  I'm gonna go up there
[8651.33s -> 8658.44s]  Goodness
[8658.44s -> 8669.95s]  Thank goodness. Let's go. I
[8669.95s -> 8671.23s]  could
[8671.23s -> 8677.66s]  How would you have known you could do this without me literally reading it in chat?
[8678.18s -> 8689.25s]  How would I ever know you could do that? You have to read it. I am the combat
[8690.62s -> 8695.38s]  Adjudicator only a technique. I see cool to the core. Well, look what I got
[8721.17s -> 8723.41s]  Come on I have two moves to do
[8724.21s -> 8726.39s]  These aren't cool enough for you
[8726.59s -> 8736.79s]  There it is. Okay one more of those and I'm good
[8737.33s -> 8745.84s]  You're in the soul of steel
[8747.16s -> 8750.84s]  Inside of every collectible pre-order box of devil may cry for
[8751.88s -> 8762.96s]  Is the soul of steel plastic toy you could claim your own it also comes with a
[8763.76s -> 8768.76s]  10 inch tall figure of Dante himself. What did I just do?
[8769.64s -> 8776.36s]  Secret mission. Oh
[8776.44s -> 8852.79s]  I don't think i'm gonna be able to do that. Oh my god. Let me get the sword out goodness. Okay, fuck off
[8895.86s -> 8900.18s]  Oh
[8900.18s -> 8908.92s]  My god, I had it. It's just like I fucking was in sludge. Oh, I was in sludge
[8912.02s -> 8916.74s]  I was in sludge. I when you locked on and you walk you walk
[8917.89s -> 8920.47s]  You don't run and I just was walking in quicksand
[8925.94s -> 8959.46s]  I got it orbs speaking of orbs. I just got a new one
[8960.02s -> 8966.85s]  Oh
[8970.95s -> 8972.95s]  Bottle is now a permitted term
[8975.52s -> 8978.00s]  For now until I well, I just said that so now it's gonna be gone
[8978.80s -> 8991.80s]  What is this behavior? This is behavior we're seeing over here
[8993.08s -> 8996.56s]  You guys supposed to be you guys must behave
[9003.14s -> 9011.00s]  All those orbs are missing
[9011.00s -> 9013.00s]  Ah, that sucks
[9016.80s -> 9018.87s]  Okay
[9018.87s -> 9020.87s]  Wait, I want those orbs
[9046.60s -> 9048.12s]  Try the parry
[9048.12s -> 9050.28s]  I think i'm probably gonna go back to trickster
[9051.59s -> 9053.67s]  Having a dodge roll is just so so good
[9054.55s -> 9071.52s]  That was not bad
[9071.52s -> 9086.45s]  You gotta be shitting me
[9086.45s -> 9104.87s]  That's just a lot of meter or whatever you want to call it. They having fun. Yeah. No, this is great
[9105.75s -> 9109.65s]  I'm just hanging out and playing i'm having a good time
[9126.92s -> 9127.80s]  um
[9127.80s -> 9129.96s]  Sorry, i'm paying attention to fighting am I supposed to get off?
[9130.68s -> 9140.60s]  I need to kill them faster
[9141.00s -> 9146.58s]  They need to get off. Oh shit
[9148.10s -> 9150.10s]  I got it. We're good
[9150.10s -> 9152.66s]  Let's go for it. They're weighing the elevator down
[9175.08s -> 9177.08s]  Oh my god
[9183.65s -> 9185.89s]  At the very least I have to change the lock on button
[9188.92s -> 9190.92s]  It's making my life a living hell right now
[9193.80s -> 9201.80s]  Can I do it through here? Please tell me I can do it through here. Thank goodness. Okay
[9202.44s -> 9207.73s]  Change target. What do I want to do item is up
[9208.37s -> 9216.08s]  Map is right change target. I don't know. What if I make that?
[9233.88s -> 9238.16s]  I I don't think there is a better button maybe one of the triggers
[9238.72s -> 9248.72s]  But I definitely don't want change going to be left stick. Oh, that's not bad
[9251.25s -> 9256.58s]  Oh, that's actually not horrible. Yeah, actually, but I have to take my finger off
[9257.14s -> 9263.04s]  I'm gonna take my hand off them. Actually, he's not great in theory. It seemed like a good idea though. Appreciate the help
[9270.92s -> 9287.33s]  Honestly, even right stick would be better. I think i'm happier with right stick because then I can do
[9291.14s -> 9295.25s]  I think yeah, that makes more sense to me. That's good. All right, let's go
[9296.05s -> 9299.19s]  It's a hard game
[9299.96s -> 9301.96s]  Are you speaking in simlish? No
[9302.20s -> 9314.37s]  Give me the shotgun for this too
[9314.37s -> 9316.37s]  I honestly probably shouldn't even lock on anybody
[9319.51s -> 9321.35s]  All right. This is
[9321.35s -> 9323.35s]  This is this is very
[9323.51s -> 9325.51s]  Like you get knocked off the
[9345.70s -> 9352.10s]  God only use neutral inputs. I'm trying to knock them off with the uh that but that's probably a bad idea
[9352.34s -> 9365.97s]  I'm just gonna stand in the middle
[9365.97s -> 9381.28s]  Don't move
[9381.28s -> 9393.67s]  Die already
[9393.67s -> 9402.05s]  There we go. Finally took me long enough
[9402.61s -> 9415.99s]  Break everything
[9415.99s -> 9422.45s]  All right. All of you devil may cry
[9422.53s -> 9427.56s]  lore masters
[9427.56s -> 9429.64s]  What what should I realistically get next?
[9437.92s -> 9441.12s]  air hike it's 20k
[9441.12s -> 9445.83s]  I'll save for air hike. I'll hold on. I'll hold on
[9446.47s -> 9452.55s]  What if I got windmill part two?
[9459.59s -> 9462.48s]  What does holy water do?
[9462.48s -> 9464.72s]  End off demons. It severely damages enemies
[9465.36s -> 9473.48s]  Very what is it gold or magic golden stone made by a secret process can recall lost souls
[9474.44s -> 9480.53s]  Don't buy anything don't buy anything. Okay, it gets you drunk
[9481.49s -> 9485.83s]  It's
[9485.83s -> 9487.83s]  It's an extra life. That sounds great
[9495.89s -> 9500.63s]  Items are for cowards
[9522.92s -> 9524.92s]  What is
[9528.20s -> 9530.44s]  How long are you two gonna keep carrying on like this
[9531.24s -> 9534.92s]  In case you didn't get the hint i'll spell it out your guest
[9535.72s -> 9537.24s]  Wants to go through
[9537.24s -> 9539.24s]  Got it enough
[9546.69s -> 9550.40s]  Give me one
[9550.40s -> 9553.97s]  Oh, they are way smaller. I thought they were huge
[9554.77s -> 9611.52s]  Let's go. Come on
[9612.00s -> 9614.69s]  All right back up back up back up back up
[9615.01s -> 9636.07s]  Walking should be illegal for the enemies to do in video games
[9654.50s -> 9660.87s]  Oh
[9660.87s -> 9675.59s]  Oh
[9675.59s -> 9678.77s]  Oh, who am I attacking here?
[9678.77s -> 9685.27s]  Shit i'm trying to just get rid of one
[9686.15s -> 9715.83s]  I'm dead. All right. I gotta I gotta burn one down quick. Does it count that I all right? I gotta burn one down
[9716.76s -> 9718.20s]  Very very fast
[9718.20s -> 9762.21s]  I'm gonna go with the green guy
[9762.21s -> 9779.01s]  Come on
[9779.01s -> 9780.37s]  guard break
[9780.37s -> 9798.82s]  I thought I said
[9798.82s -> 9800.82s]  Um, this is very hard
[9801.38s -> 9811.62s]  Okay, I got it. Oh, I could change my style. I'm not even using this thing
[9812.98s -> 9871.64s]  All right, got one break guard break guard break
[9893.35s -> 9943.08s]  How do I heal? All right, let's go. Uh, so they
[9950.92s -> 9952.52s]  All right. This is
[9952.52s -> 9954.52s]  Not great. I don't know
[9954.52s -> 9956.52s]  Okay. Thanks for the thanks for the heads up
[9993.41s -> 10007.73s]  Get up got it. That was hard
[10012.84s -> 10014.84s]  Yes
[10032.45s -> 10039.24s]  Okay, but on one condition what is it name it no talking
[10046.02s -> 10048.02s]  No talking
[10048.98s -> 10053.44s]  Whoa, they think all right. I want to use these I don't care what any other weapon is
[10054.40s -> 10058.44s]  This looks he's a cool
[10071.16s -> 10074.23s]  I don't know. I kind of I think I would want to
[10074.79s -> 10080.45s]  I would want to talk don't you think you'd want to ask a few questions just pass the time a little
[10081.65s -> 10088.04s]  I would be the annoying one to them fire
[10088.68s -> 10090.04s]  And tornado
[10090.04s -> 10094.64s]  Okay, you can only have two different weapons at a time
[10095.20s -> 10106.88s]  Got to change it up. So what do I have? I I can't change that now, right?
[10107.36s -> 10129.75s]  I'll try it instead of the sword. I had that had to been much better
[10130.63s -> 10132.69s]  what
[10132.69s -> 10134.72s]  Yep
[10134.72s -> 10137.09s]  Okay
[10137.09s -> 10139.43s]  All right
[10139.43s -> 10140.90s]  Hey
[10140.90s -> 10147.84s]  I got the orb. That's all the matters, right?
[10148.40s -> 10155.09s]  Hey, dude, do you want us to disable the tweet command because you yeah, I mean
[10155.89s -> 10159.67s]  I just have to tweet anything else. I I might just write
[10160.31s -> 10163.59s]  I don't know. I'm writing like oh, hello. I'm
[10164.55s -> 10167.99s]  Oh, hi is my tweet. That's uh, wow

[10178.79s -> 10183.19s]  Be like I can't I can't fucking understand what's going on. Just pull out like five random players
[10183.91s -> 10185.91s]  And be like, I don't know what fucking happened there
[10186.31s -> 10188.79s]  The three pointers tonight from they weren't very good
[10208.36s -> 10211.62s]  Is that a cannon that thing looks pretty crazy
[10243.19s -> 10247.27s]  There it is. Yeah, that's what I want. I I want a cannon. I hope I can get this item
[10248.07s -> 10267.49s]  You're saying this is a ps2 game was three still in the ps2 era. That's kind of remarkable if that's
[10268.13s -> 10271.91s]  Is that real?
[10271.91s -> 10275.30s]  Wow
[10275.30s -> 10278.82s]  I it does look like a pia. I was wondering the cutscenes are a little
[10279.86s -> 10282.10s]  a little scratchy around the edges
[10282.82s -> 10287.84s]  I was wondering
[10287.84s -> 10289.84s]  I did. Yeah, that's ps2
[10290.72s -> 10298.58s]  That's kind of unbelievable
[10298.58s -> 10300.42s]  All right. Well, i'm definitely going to try
[10300.42s -> 10310.48s]  Let's try these
[10310.48s -> 10314.96s]  All right, i'm gonna buy these until I have no more money left and then turn my power button on my computer off until
[10314.96s -> 10316.68s]  I turn it off
[10316.68s -> 10318.68s]  And then just and just leave
[10318.76s -> 10330.93s]  All right. I want to test these out
[10330.93s -> 10339.33s]  So you put them together
[10339.33s -> 10343.88s]  Do they have a backswing move?
[10344.92s -> 10356.80s]  I guess I could go look right
[10356.80s -> 10358.80s]  Okay, so
[10360.00s -> 10371.38s]  Why why why why why why why pause why why why pause why pause?
[10371.86s -> 10389.19s]  Why and then just in midair forward on the stick and why I still have this?
[10392.74s -> 10395.38s]  So type three combo is what I have to use this with
[10395.78s -> 10405.94s]  So I need to I need to do why pause why pause why why why why why why let's try it
[10409.52s -> 10418.21s]  That is
[10423.89s -> 10429.19s]  When do I start to mash it
[10430.07s -> 10435.00s]  After the second pause
[10435.92s -> 10441.35s]  My goodness, that's insane
[10449.33s -> 10453.49s]  The regular combo is good, too
[10458.29s -> 10462.53s]  On second pause why pause why pause
[10463.49s -> 10473.99s]  The upgrades make this weapon fun
[10473.99s -> 10474.95s]  Okay
[10474.95s -> 10484.79s]  Can I move this?
[10498.37s -> 10499.33s]  Whoa
[10499.33s -> 10500.93s]  Where did those come from?
[10500.93s -> 10516.47s]  I don't think I have enough I could try it on jet stream level two
[10519.41s -> 10521.33s]  Uh, should I get air hike for this?
[10521.97s -> 10534.45s]  Did you tell your mother's happy mother's day? I did passing one trial still shows lacking
[10534.85s -> 10538.61s]  Passing two expands horizons passing all three unlocks true potential
[10541.17s -> 10557.67s]  Your wisdom we put to the test your technique to the test and then your warrior's heart the test
[10558.07s -> 10601.57s]  I'm gonna go here. See how smart I am. That was easy. All right in a game scenario
[10601.57s -> 10624.95s]  This is actually hard to do because I think these enemies are just horrible
[10642.29s -> 10643.09s]  Yeah
[10643.09s -> 10670.00s]  They're all fucking room full of them. I want to start this room over actually. Yeah start over
[10670.40s -> 10690.44s]  All right
[10690.44s -> 10711.94s]  So these have little lit this this is one four and then three one two three four read the hint
[10712.18s -> 10722.53s]  Use your lifetime experience from the crawling infant to the man standing tall and finally the old man leaning on his cane
[10729.70s -> 10760.23s]  infant tall man old man infant infant
[10760.55s -> 10780.92s]  What is in which one of these is an infant? He's already seen it in chat. It's too late. Yeah, it's too late
[10781.40s -> 10786.69s]  Yeah, I'm I was pretending to walk around and not know where I was going. I was like, okay
[10787.83s -> 10801.19s]  Infant tall man where and i've read it a minute and a half ago at least hey, look at that. There it is
[10801.67s -> 10834.71s]  I won't read chat anymore. So I got an m. What is it a blue gem? What is that thing? So I got it
[10834.95s -> 10845.75s]  So can I just just go wherever? All right, i'm not going to reach half of this one
[10845.75s -> 10851.01s]  I'm just going to try to do it overcome the onslaught of obstacles to guarantee your future
[10851.09s -> 10905.76s]  All right. All right, so that's when you gotta go like right here. Oh my god. Wait, did those hit me?
[10908.48s -> 10922.95s]  Those don't hit me
[10923.51s -> 10933.30s]  I thought the one's pointing down we're gonna hit I got it
[10961.84s -> 10974.13s]  I gotta break it. Can I turn this back on and maybe get them hurt?
[10975.73s -> 10980.21s]  I hate these fucking flying motherfuckers without I hate them. I hate these things
[10988.63s -> 10991.51s]  This is one once I attack one another one's already attacking me
[10992.80s -> 10994.40s]  Oh my
[10994.40s -> 11010.23s]  I hate these fucking things. I have one
[11010.85s -> 11036.05s]  hp and
[11036.53s -> 11059.58s]  I already did it that counts. Okay. Does this have anything that I need to read light all the crests
[11059.90s -> 11129.76s]  I think this is just a fight dying is actually a speed run strat. That's funny. Okay, let's go. Whoa, look out. Stop walking
[11130.80s -> 11136.11s]  Go all this guy doesn't walk
[11136.11s -> 11176.67s]  I think I have to turn these on die
[11177.07s -> 11220.32s]  I was at s2 shit. Is it on timer? I need to do that move
[11223.04s -> 11230.99s]  Why pause why pause why pause? I can't pull it off
[11252.70s -> 11258.78s]  What the fuck? I'm gonna lose
[11259.66s -> 11262.38s]  I have to sit here and practice this move until I can do it without thinking about it
[11266.67s -> 11268.91s]  Why pause why pause why pause?
[11269.63s -> 11277.98s]  Like that, right?
[11277.98s -> 11283.04s]  Why pause what?
[11283.04s -> 11285.84s]  All right. I have to get this down. Otherwise, i'm just gonna take the weapon off
[11290.69s -> 11291.97s]  Why?
[11291.97s -> 11303.58s]  It's why why why that's it there, but I I want to do the thing you do you spin him around like crazy
[11312.14s -> 11326.99s]  Yeah, why pause why pause why why why why why why what i'm doing won't work. It's longer pauses
[11328.96s -> 11338.77s]  Yeah
[11338.77s -> 11343.89s]  You're doing why pause why why why pause why pause why why why why why why why
[11344.29s -> 11377.28s]  Yeah, but aren't I supposed to mash after the second pause to do the follow-up? I feel like I just did the same thing
[11393.81s -> 11412.90s]  All right, so it's okay it's much slower I think I got it let's do it if you're playing at 60 fps
[11412.90s -> 11415.65s]  You have to mash really fast. Oh
[11429.33s -> 11431.33s]  Is that actually true? Okay
[11437.73s -> 11477.30s]  Why pause why pause why why why why why there it is? Oh, that was it
[11488.10s -> 11490.10s]  You really don't want to do for that long though. You're just vulnerable
[11501.31s -> 11514.21s]  Okay, well, let's go. So I'm I'm I need to light these up, right?
[11515.79s -> 11518.99s]  Focusing on trying to learn how to do that move and not play the game
[11546.85s -> 11548.13s]  Whoa
[11548.13s -> 11564.82s]  All right, let's go
[11568.94s -> 11569.98s]  Watch out
[11569.98s -> 11611.84s]  Do it. Oh my god. Those guys are fucking horrible. I might die again
[11621.55s -> 11649.10s]  Jesus they powered up. I gotta get powered up too then they're invincible unless I spin the wheels
[11649.42s -> 11652.94s]  That's what I was thinking too. I was like why are these guys so fucking horrible?
[11653.18s -> 11655.49s]  It has to be something to do with this goddamn wheel
[11686.16s -> 11733.87s]  Much better. All right, I think I can't hurt them again. Yep. There we go. I feel much better about this now
[11734.19s -> 11767.63s]  All right last part hit it. I'm so paranoid. They're gonna hit me
[11768.43s -> 11800.98s]  Okay, be careful here. Oh my god. You are the worst enemy in the fucking game
[11805.33s -> 11811.89s]  You're worse than the bat whatever they are the bat thing. Shit didn't do it fast enough
[11812.93s -> 11824.75s]  Am I hurting them?
[11824.75s -> 11825.79s]  Whoa
[11825.79s -> 11828.42s]  Don't get out of the way. I want to hit this thing
[11840.40s -> 11863.81s]  Holy shit. That was really really wacky. Somebody said finally ban that person or let's go all in a month
[11864.05s -> 11886.93s]  And now what passing one trial still shows lacking. Okay, so I did three right? What do I put them? They go in like a
[11892.93s -> 11917.33s]  All right, do I want this on the regular sword? I don't know. These are fun. It's for any weapon
[11917.49s -> 11927.81s]  Oh wait, it's for every weapon. Does it carry over? I'll get used to these
[11927.81s -> 11935.65s]  I feel like these are gonna be better. I'm sticking with these. I gotta get used to it and maybe it'll be better
[11936.99s -> 11950.29s]  All right double jump. Wow, that makes this so much better
[11953.52s -> 11997.34s]  That's amazing. So I did that put them all in okay a gun of the demon world that discharges arrows
[11998.38s -> 12026.96s]  It's a gun. Ooh, i'll try it. Oh, okay
[12040.08s -> 12042.58s]  Thank you
[12042.58s -> 12045.46s]  The gunslinger gun, otherwise, it's not great
[12049.09s -> 12059.70s]  Oh, look at I only have 700 orbs. That's not a lot. I'm playing on trickster
[12075.60s -> 12083.41s]  You point a gun at me your own kid
[12084.70s -> 12089.94s]  Your dear papa the only family I ever had was my mother
[12090.90s -> 12092.90s]  And she's dead
[12096.08s -> 12098.08s]  You break my heart
[12098.48s -> 12100.66s]  after all
[12100.66s -> 12102.66s]  It was I who gave you your name
[12109.82s -> 12126.13s]  One day a game or a movie will have that happen but it'll hit him right in the face
[12126.77s -> 12142.24s]  Plenty of orbs. I got plenty of orbs
[12146.16s -> 12148.22s]  Imagine getting a b
[12148.22s -> 12151.42s]  Because you didn't use any items and collected it all the stuff
[12176.00s -> 12178.00s]  You got a b for perfect attendance
[12178.24s -> 12181.02s]  That's what it feels like
[12181.02s -> 12183.02s]  Well, this is my kind of rain
[12183.89s -> 12187.41s]  No wonder the sky looks so funny today. Let me go
[12188.21s -> 12193.46s]  Let you go, but it would be a waste if you ended up with just a pretty stain
[12200.02s -> 12208.08s]  It did happen
[12208.08s -> 12211.20s]  Here I am trying to help you and you show your thanks by shooting me
[12218.56s -> 12220.56s]  Whatever choose you please
[12226.14s -> 12228.14s]  So he's a demon, too
[12229.89s -> 12232.61s]  I'm beginning to think i've got rotten luck with women
[12239.97s -> 12245.73s]  Okay, uh
[12247.28s -> 12248.88s]  I try these
[12248.88s -> 12250.88s]  I'll give them a try see if they're any good
[12250.88s -> 12254.91s]  All right. Let's take a few break. I'll be right back
[12254.91s -> 12261.98s]  I'm back in place some more. Did anybody know how how long is this game? The first one was
[12262.70s -> 12265.20s]  Like eight hours or so are they all kind of like
[12265.84s -> 12271.76s]  Seven to ten. It's 20 missions 20 chapters
[12274.78s -> 12276.75s]  Just was curious
[12276.75s -> 12282.08s]  I will be right back
[12282.08s -> 12286.16s]  Uh, I can't really alt tab. So you're gonna have to be left with this on the brb screen. Unfortunately
[12288.61s -> 12296.27s]  Oh, well, it didn't matter. I will be will this work? Let's see
[12296.83s -> 12579.41s]  All right, i'll be right back. What is going on? What's up?
[12579.97s -> 12585.23s]  It's back on
[12585.23s -> 12588.99s]  Well now you can hear it
[12588.99s -> 12599.90s]  There we go. Oh, I forgot I was supposed I gotta clear my throat before I say anything
[12600.62s -> 12607.38s]  Hey ordered a dork cube years ago with your promo code or still haven't received it
[12609.02s -> 12614.64s]  um
[12614.64s -> 12617.73s]  Yeah
[12617.73s -> 12619.89s]  I don't think I can't afford anything either. So i'm gonna go
[12628.10s -> 12629.38s]  Try the new weapon
[12629.38s -> 12639.84s]  Can I charge it?
[12639.84s -> 12681.54s]  Find out normal shot. I guess not. Yes. It's just a regular shoot weapon. Whoa need to level gunslinger
[12681.86s -> 12695.39s]  That would make sense. It's 20 missions in every devil may cry except for one and five
[12695.55s -> 12721.04s]  Okay, is the quesadilla just a really thin taco you're asking the real questions tonight, I think no, I don't think so
[12722.82s -> 12729.79s]  Sorry, I was reading chat
[12731.20s -> 12739.63s]  Wait, whoa. Whoa, there's a lot of stuff down here. Look at this. Look at all these orbs. I gotta get all these
[12740.03s -> 12762.56s]  What else is up here?
[12763.52s -> 12767.36s]  Just going all the way up
[12775.12s -> 12789.76s]  There were at least five people that said to ban that guy i'm also realizing something very important about myself
[12793.60s -> 12798.08s]  I need these to be switched and i've been playing for like three and a half hours already
[12799.58s -> 12819.46s]  But I have to change this it makes way more sense
[12820.10s -> 12827.95s]  I can't believe that guy got banned for a month for what he said
[12829.42s -> 12830.38s]  I know
[12830.38s -> 12877.28s]  me either attacks. Damn it. Damn it
[12877.92s -> 12912.30s]  I wish that staggered you're bad at chess. Yeah, I am. I know that. Oh nice. Hey, did the lakers lose? Uh,
[12915.17s -> 12930.45s]  Baby, did they? Oh, what if what if somebody t voted though? I don't want to spoil it for them, right?
[12930.45s -> 12974.58s]  If somebody t voted we don't want to they might want to watch it later out of that. That's a lot of people
[12984.40s -> 12994.75s]  Dude, come on. I just got full health
[13004.69s -> 13012.66s]  You guys are all standing in a good five foot square around each other. I can't get in there
[13013.22s -> 13114.22s]  I just went right into it. Watch out. Do jump x jump x jump x. Okay. Those guys had trillion health
[13120.10s -> 13126.59s]  secrets
[13126.59s -> 13130.80s]  Ah, you can only do the double jump when it's active. That makes sense. I get it
[13130.96s -> 13140.54s]  But this bird I thought this person said do you have a super ball under your chair?
[13140.62s -> 13164.19s]  I'm trying to figure out what the hell that was supposed to mean magic essence. Oh, I can't get into this one
[13171.44s -> 13191.23s]  Damn it. Nice. This is what the elevator is. That's the elevator control power panel
[13191.55s -> 13225.47s]  I gotta go put that thing that other gem in that slot. No, that doesn't go there
[13229.79s -> 13235.97s]  Tom's flames. Oh, I know what that is. Can I go back to there? There's a door with the fire on it
[13236.05s -> 13244.46s]  I think that's where I gotta go. All right, come on
[13245.02s -> 13277.82s]  Okay, so
[13277.90s -> 13315.86s]  Where is that place? Can I even get back there from here? Okay, I think i'm going the right way now. I hope so
[13316.50s -> 13339.78s]  Steam, uh, yeah, this is the pc port part of the hd collection. Honestly, this is my favorite weapon so far
[13340.66s -> 13355.44s]  I think it's the best one
[13357.36s -> 13375.49s]  Yeah, I like it the most for sure back to the elevator that I was thinking of doing
[13376.69s -> 13381.04s]  Will you do anything else besides the third game?
[13383.44s -> 13386.64s]  I I probably will just play them all at some point. I have to imagine
[13387.20s -> 13391.23s]  They're not particularly long games. Not like it's like oh my god
[13391.31s -> 13402.96s]  It's gonna take me like a month to beat it a couple of streams per game probably that makes sense to me
[13403.68s -> 13408.35s]  All right. So that's a power source for the elevator
[13421.02s -> 13425.41s]  Just skip two. I feel like everyone's telling me how bad two is
[13426.05s -> 13429.49s]  Everyone's like oh, no, no, no, no, no, you get away from two. Don't play two
[13430.45s -> 13434.77s]  I almost want to play it because keep I keep seeing people say such awful things about it
[13435.33s -> 13442.90s]  Can I go into two with the mindset of i'm gonna play it for an hour and just not care?
[13443.70s -> 13445.30s]  Would that be okay?
[13445.30s -> 13459.89s]  And look if I play it and i'm like, holy goodness. This is really awful and i'll just stop playing it. Not a big deal
[13462.13s -> 13502.62s]  All right, let's try to get a perfect here well it was there but I screwed it up stop
[13507.14s -> 13508.74s]  Oh my goodness
[13508.74s -> 13526.34s]  Does this game have any bathroom humor? Um, I don't think so
[13527.26s -> 13529.54s]  Maybe no
[13529.54s -> 13536.74s]  Is that your criteria for if you're gonna buy the game or not? Where's the bathroom humor, dude?
[13538.58s -> 13559.62s]  You're better than this. It's more dad joke humor. I can say that
[13564.06s -> 13571.82s]  devil may cry 2 gets boring very quickly once you realize how effective bullet spam is just overall not fun encounters
[13572.38s -> 13577.94s]  piece and take
[13577.94s -> 13586.70s]  It's a good take I think what's bathroom humor stuff like this like if I were to make a big
[13587.50s -> 13594.38s]  From your understanding, why are these games titled devil may cry?
[13596.78s -> 13599.90s]  So because i'm dante from dante's inferno
[13600.91s -> 13604.59s]  And there's a demon that i'm going after and I am so good
[13605.57s -> 13608.51s]  I am so
[13608.51s -> 13613.47s]  I'm so talented and i'm so dangerous that the devils are the the devils are afraid of me
[13614.56s -> 13618.08s]  So oh dante's coming. Ah, he's gonna kill us
[13619.04s -> 13621.92s]  Everybody like that's what I think like devil may cry
[13625.30s -> 13627.86s]  Because whoa dante is very scary
[13636.59s -> 13653.10s]  That's how i've always viewed this
[13653.50s -> 13664.83s]  Let's get in there
[13677.82s -> 13694.11s]  And even you can do combos like that if you put your dante's inferno free, okay, I don't think I can
[13700.53s -> 13702.53s]  Come on
[13708.03s -> 13709.55s]  How do I get out of here
[13709.55s -> 13711.62s]  Okay
[13711.62s -> 13738.27s]  Oh is actually that I actually had to do that. I would have stuck here for a while. Come on gwen. Come on gwen
[13739.07s -> 13764.82s]  I like that. That was a good chat. That was a good message. Did I do it? I don't think I did it
[13766.42s -> 13768.42s]  I don't know what I let's do it again
[13768.58s -> 13789.14s]  I think if I break the statues that's what I would be doing
[13795.20s -> 13798.72s]  Is it not smash into these statues that do I just would break the ball?
[13827.18s -> 13843.95s]  It's glowing in fact, I just heard that
[13847.31s -> 13849.47s]  That like child laughing sound effect
[13853.95s -> 13861.92s]  Oh, I get it. All right, you guys know that the stock laugh sound they're like
[13862.08s -> 13864.08s]  Yeah
[13864.96s -> 13872.35s]  I can't do it
[13872.35s -> 13887.70s]  I'm fine
[13887.70s -> 13891.38s]  No, I like I want to see where i'm fucking swinging this thing
[13892.83s -> 13894.83s]  How do I get the camera to go this way?
[13897.33s -> 13904.53s]  Popular stock sound effect is it there it is
[13909.81s -> 13921.01s]  That was it. You've never heard that before. No, no way. You definitely have you just didn't process it
[13921.33s -> 13933.26s]  All right, turn the camera
[13933.26s -> 13935.98s]  No, stop. I want to face this direction
[13937.70s -> 13939.46s]  Dante
[13939.46s -> 13941.06s]  Dante, please
[13941.06s -> 13983.30s]  Just hit it. I am
[13984.22s -> 13986.46s]  It's a it's not a physics puzzle
[13987.26s -> 14017.42s]  I'm not supposed to break the statues or break. I was saying that too. What you guys told me I had to break the door
[14017.66s -> 14019.66s]  All right. I'm never looking over here again
[14028.58s -> 14030.58s]  Oh my god
[14030.66s -> 14045.04s]  I don't want to do this again
[14056.26s -> 14068.10s]  How far away am I right now? What is going on?
[14072.26s -> 14076.02s]  Where what's happening right now? What's going on? Where am I? Why did they put me all the way back here?
[14079.79s -> 14083.23s]  He asked if it was hard and then a laughing face
[14087.90s -> 14100.13s]  Oh, it's over here
[14100.45s -> 14103.54s]  This is hard
[14103.54s -> 14104.82s]  Yeah, it is
[14104.82s -> 14126.46s]  Can I just do I have to do any of this? I guess I don't
[14128.80s -> 14130.08s]  Okay
[14130.08s -> 14132.08s]  I'm good. Can I leave? No, I can't I have to be
[14132.80s -> 14138.11s]  And how come they get to queue up a swing during the cutscene and I don't
[14140.08s -> 14156.91s]  Unfair my lord
[14171.82s -> 14173.82s]  Is there a mod to make the lock on better?
[14174.85s -> 14188.32s]  Can I please install one pushing in the stick to change enemies is
[14189.04s -> 14218.14s]  Is driving me insane, especially when there's so many enemies in a room to have to switch between
[14218.62s -> 14227.60s]  Having to press the stick in makes me want to throw up one and it and it picks a random fucking person
[14228.40s -> 14261.86s]  What a drama queen. It makes me want to throw up blood. This lock on is so bad. It makes me want to puke blood
[14264.03s -> 14276.00s]  Whoa?
[14276.00s -> 14278.00s]  It he's always so dramatic
[14294.61s -> 14296.61s]  I'm trying to think of any other
[14296.69s -> 14301.84s]  Hold on. This is the only scenario where you can talk like that
[14302.90s -> 14306.98s]  Right. This is the only scenario where you could where that people I mean it was a weird thing that I said
[14307.62s -> 14311.78s]  But in any other scenario, it's like what the fuck is this person talking about?
[14312.50s -> 14320.10s]  Can you imagine going to the doctor and you have like a wart on your finger?
[14323.14s -> 14327.78s]  Hey doctor, I got this ward on my finger. Let me take care of that. I I I can get that ward off
[14327.86s -> 14330.05s]  They're very hard though
[14330.13s -> 14331.33s]  Oh kid
[14331.33s -> 14334.93s]  That's this thing. This thing's really giving us some trouble here. Hold on still. Let me just get that word up
[14335.41s -> 14337.89s]  This is so hard. Just makes me want to fucking puke blood
[14338.69s -> 14342.66s]  It's like, uh, all right
[14342.90s -> 14361.30s]  Didn't you have a ward on your finger? No, it was a gamer boil and I want you to get it right
[14391.54s -> 14422.67s]  Get out of the way
[14422.67s -> 14465.70s]  Oh fuck. Let me out of here. I mean that made me just want to puke blood
[14466.66s -> 14488.42s]  What did I get for doing that? What was it? What was the point of this?
[14489.22s -> 14492.29s]  I got the thing right. What did I just pick up?
[14492.85s -> 14524.26s]  What did I pick up this thing right here? Right now this goes in that other side. It has to back
[14524.82s -> 14526.26s]  up this way
[14526.26s -> 14530.06s]  Back to where the elevator is
[14530.06s -> 14538.22s]  I gotta get these
[14538.22s -> 14540.22s]  It's time finally
[14540.22s -> 14543.98s]  The people that are writing that I just want to make sure you understand
[14544.77s -> 14550.78s]  Um, i'm not going to tolerate it. I mods what I want you to do anybody that says finally
[14551.26s -> 14555.18s]  I'm not going to tolerate it. I would like for you to start timing people out
[14555.66s -> 14569.95s]  For exactly five seconds every time they say that and if they do it again
[14570.59s -> 14572.99s]  Then I want you to time them out again a second time
[14575.95s -> 14577.95s]  All right. I have to play the fucking video game
[14581.66s -> 14592.34s]  I gotta go all the way up. I just keep seeing things shining on hold on. It's the yellow door, right?
[14609.14s -> 14614.85s]  Wait, can I actually
[14614.85s -> 14618.66s]  Can I go this way?
[14618.66s -> 14625.34s]  No, where's that elevator? I kind of just appeared in this room. How do I get out of here over here, right?
[14625.82s -> 14657.14s]  Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. The camera was weird. I already got that i'm doing that the hell
[14658.45s -> 14660.29s]  No, this is wrong
[14660.29s -> 14662.29s]  This is wrong. No, it's just right. That's right
[14662.77s -> 14685.44s]  Oh, he does a backswing
[14685.44s -> 14693.50s]  one two three
[14707.84s -> 14726.91s]  Oh shit rematch
[14739.41s -> 14742.53s]  How do you pull off a guard break or does it just a certain amount of damage when they're guarding
[14742.93s -> 14778.06s]  Oh, that does not work here. Yeah
[14778.78s -> 14817.12s]  10 000 why are you attacking him when he did nothing wrong? I had to
[14817.60s -> 14821.12s]  Hey, sorry, I had to fuck him up, okay
[14846.08s -> 14874.86s]  Oh, this is weird. Oh, it's worth doing anything right now. Probably not
[14891.68s -> 14896.50s]  Yeah, it's all right. You probably need to be a gun specialist to care about it
[14896.98s -> 14906.11s]  All right. This is the one here. It's definitely a boss. Am I happy with this?
[14907.23s -> 14909.66s]  I like the nunchucks
[14909.74s -> 14924.35s]  Yeah
[14924.35s -> 14936.70s]  Get streamed level two
[14937.10s -> 14970.48s]  I'm not doing anything. Not yet kind of scared. What's through this door? Let's find out. This is the fight
[14999.81s -> 15007.22s]  You showed up
[15007.22s -> 15010.35s]  You sure know how to throw a party. No food
[15010.91s -> 15013.34s]  No drinks
[15013.34s -> 15015.34s]  And the only babe just left
[15016.14s -> 15018.14s]  my sincerest apology
[15018.94s -> 15021.63s]  I was so eager to see you
[15021.79s -> 15025.47s]  Somebody said well time to puke blood. Am I gonna get mad?
[15026.43s -> 15036.56s]  Uh-oh at any rate it's been a whole year since we last met kiss from your little brother kiss from this
[15037.44s -> 15045.75s]  This is what they call a heartwarming family reunion

[15172.43s -> 15174.69s]  Let me explain
[15174.69s -> 15177.31s]  Uh, let me explain
[15177.39s -> 15179.39s]  So the leftmost button
[15179.71s -> 15181.97s]  Can we all agree?
[15181.97s -> 15183.89s]  the leftmost button
[15183.89s -> 15189.09s]  Of the face buttons i'm talking ab x y whatever the leftmost button
[15189.73s -> 15194.05s]  Should always be attacked right like just like swing weapon always
[15195.18s -> 15196.54s]  It wasn't that
[15196.54s -> 15199.18s]  I halfway through the stream changed it to that
[15200.14s -> 15203.90s]  And now i'm getting crossed up shooting when i'm swinging and I should have just done it
[15203.90s -> 15205.90s]  I should have fixed it in the very beginning
[15257.01s -> 15261.17s]  X x x it's not y to attack. It's x it hit x
[15261.65s -> 15266.53s]  Sometimes i'll be like jump y it's like why did you do that blood?
[15267.17s -> 15277.02s]  Imagine you imagine saying that
[15278.35s -> 15282.03s]  You you you blood you go blood. Oh blood

[15575.49s -> 15578.37s]  Oh, oh we saw this

[15957.41s -> 15958.69s]  At least once
[15958.69s -> 15962.79s]  I might even do it twice
[15962.79s -> 15963.91s]  That probably was
[15963.91s -> 15967.67s]  Insane what I just did you probably just are you can't believe what just happened
[15969.86s -> 15980.84s]  i'm doing it
[15980.84s -> 15982.84s]  How is this still level one?
[15983.24s -> 15986.18s]  I'm still level one
[15986.18s -> 15995.33s]  I gotta get to level two
[16007.06s -> 16011.81s]  Devil trigger unleash dante's true power need three

[16322.82s -> 16325.46s]  How can I do it with one do I have to have all three turned on?
[16326.10s -> 16330.13s]  Okay, so all three have to be activated
[16330.29s -> 16332.53s]  It's the only way I can hurt anybody
[16332.53s -> 16347.83s]  This mission is awful and so you're really powered up
[16348.47s -> 16349.51s]  Yeah
[16349.51s -> 16357.64s]  How do I just i'm gonna die

[16468.23s -> 16480.84s]  The second door over here
[16481.16s -> 16488.69s]  This is where I came from
[16489.33s -> 16494.52s]  I have no idea where this is
[16501.09s -> 16512.85s]  I have to break it. Is he trolling?
[16514.79s -> 16516.95s]  No

[16533.06s -> 16535.24s]  And then I went this way and I couldn't go anywhere else
[16541.59s -> 16543.03s]  I can get off here
[16543.03s -> 16544.39s]  All right

[17596.58s -> 17600.63s]  The right one has less health I think the weapon was a little more tanky
[17606.72s -> 17612.72s]  Rage and agonies of the people those who were confined here
[17613.52s -> 17617.24s]  With their desires for evil being unfulfilled
[17618.82s -> 17625.49s]  It was all because sparta slapped stealing devil trigger the world in their faces
[17626.53s -> 17636.92s]  What's wrong?
[17636.92s -> 17642.42s]  Yeah, it's still on normal
[17642.42s -> 17644.18s]  Late night stream cozy
[17644.18s -> 17649.27s]  Playing some game
[17649.27s -> 17661.94s]  You know
[17661.94s -> 17665.76s]  Really nice
[17666.24s -> 17667.52s]  All right
[17667.52s -> 17672.63s]  Haven't seen an a stylus yet
[17676.74s -> 17679.72s]  So much how am I so bad with damage though?
[17682.42s -> 17698.47s]  Damage at a d
[17698.47s -> 17700.47s]  Oh, it's how much damage i'm taking
[17701.11s -> 17709.59s]  That's like 50 000 damage. That sounds like a lot man. That's how much i've been taking
[17764.64s -> 17766.64s]  I would want to be friends with leviathan
[17768.15s -> 17774.18s]  How would I do that?
[17774.18s -> 17776.18s]  So this is the next stage
[17776.66s -> 17778.71s]  wait
[17778.71s -> 17780.71s]  If you're asking for a date
[17782.53s -> 17786.69s]  Forget it because I make it a point not to go out with women who shoot me in the head
[17787.49s -> 17789.49s]  Date a demon
[17789.89s -> 17791.89s]  I'm not that desperate
[17791.89s -> 17795.73s]  Besides, I really don't care for guys who stink like blood
[17801.52s -> 17803.52s]  You're right
[17813.43s -> 17818.55s]  Then what should I call you I don't care whatever you want whatever lady
[17823.62s -> 17825.62s]  I'll leave this to you
[17825.78s -> 17827.78s]  Because I don't want to miss the party
[17843.40s -> 17844.76s]  I'm gonna eat
[17844.76s -> 17847.00s]  I know i'm gonna call them souls, but that's the way it is
[17854.40s -> 17858.37s]  I want it. This is the
[17860.85s -> 17879.19s]  I don't care. I want it. This is my favorite weapon. So I have a question if my favorite weapon
[17879.91s -> 17882.15s]  Are currently it's the nunchucks
[17882.15s -> 17883.97s]  Should I
[17883.97s -> 17887.97s]  Do sword master will I get more if I do sword master trickster is good, but
[17896.00s -> 17898.00s]  You can jump cancel with level two
[17898.80s -> 17904.60s]  High energy stream
[17904.60s -> 17906.90s]  This is the lower energy stream
[17907.46s -> 17910.60s]  You're gonna have to level it up. Uh
[17912.72s -> 17914.96s]  Yeah, that's true. I'll stick with trickster. No
[17915.60s -> 17927.35s]  The game is very high energy
[17927.35s -> 17931.32s]  Yeah, but as long as I can turn
[17931.96s -> 17933.96s]  I don't know if I can turn my brain off
[17934.79s -> 17937.27s]  And focus a lot of times I usually can do okay
[17938.69s -> 17940.69s]  I mean d is still passing great
[17940.93s -> 17951.40s]  The time is there right now 11. Okay, maybe at the end of this section. I'll call over tonight. That'll get us on
[17953.20s -> 17960.44s]  Chapter 10, which is essentially perfectly halfway. I think that makes sense
[17976.87s -> 17984.93s]  Oh
[17984.93s -> 17988.23s]  They're not okay. They're not that bad. They're not as bad as I thought they were gonna be
[17989.96s -> 17991.96s]  They're still kind of weird, but whatever
[17992.20s -> 18011.96s]  I think it's way better now
[18042.29s -> 18044.69s]  Don't okay, it says there's a little wind up there
[18045.57s -> 18075.72s]  One more where is it? Is virgil playable? I would imagine
[18076.28s -> 18097.44s]  The answer to that question is yes. I don't know though. Wait, is that a mirror shine the light mirror?
[18097.76s -> 18105.43s]  Puzzle is that is that actually here? Is this for real? This is really in here
[18108.12s -> 18115.86s]  Oh, well, all right cool
[18115.86s -> 18124.61s]  Radiate the image sunken in the depths below to open a new path. It is a spin the mirror puzzle
[18127.62s -> 18136.12s]  How do I spin it?
[18156.29s -> 18176.71s]  How do I turn them oh I get it
[18180.16s -> 18191.35s]  He needs to use critical thinking skills. Yeah, but I thought that was I didn't know if there was a tilt button or something
[18191.59s -> 18201.96s]  Hit b on stuff. What does it even do for me? I got no money
[18226.07s -> 18244.39s]  Oh, I cannot go that way. What's for breakfast two sausage patties. Yep
[18245.11s -> 18247.41s]  two sausage patties and
[18248.37s -> 18269.78s]  Breakfast sausage patties by the way, one fried egg three four pieces of pineapple
[18280.20s -> 18293.86s]  Over medium. I don't like over easy. All right, so a few pieces of pineapple two
[18295.36s -> 18316.08s]  Sausage patties one egg could be all right. Well, these things hurt you on the edge
[18329.72s -> 18332.68s]  Ooh
[18332.68s -> 18350.15s]  You can extend that
[18350.15s -> 18355.24s]  Actually, I like hard-boiled eggs, but I don't like them after a day. I used to eat them all the time
[18356.88s -> 18358.96s]  I would make a dozen eggs. I'd get a carton of eggs
[18359.36s -> 18364.07s]  And hard boil all of them and I would eat two or three of them every single day for breakfast
[18364.71s -> 18369.27s]  And then sometimes I'd have another one or two later. This is when I was lifting because then I was going to the gym all the time
[18370.15s -> 18374.52s]  Uh, I would eat a lot of eggs and a lot of tuna fish. I used to eat tuna out of the can
[18375.96s -> 18380.13s]  as a snack, I would go to the gym and
[18380.69s -> 18381.97s]  I would do
[18381.97s -> 18383.41s]  You know
[18383.41s -> 18385.41s]  Backed and biceps, right?
[18386.85s -> 18389.01s]  And then I would eat a can of tuna
[18389.73s -> 18391.49s]  When I just got back
[18391.49s -> 18401.80s]  Why do you meal prep hard-boiled eggs?
[18402.96s -> 18408.88s]  Hard-boiled eggs are awesome for meal prep. They're great. They go with tons of stuff. They're really good
[18414.08s -> 18417.28s]  Not cooked and hard-boiled egg is boiled
[18418.24s -> 18420.63s]  boiled egg
[18420.63s -> 18423.99s]  Stop lying. I'm not I've talked about this like in an old video
[18424.87s -> 18426.87s]  From like almost 10 years ago
[18429.35s -> 18431.35s]  anchovies, I I
[18431.43s -> 18433.86s]  You know what? I talked about this a lot
[18435.36s -> 18444.16s]  Anchovies not anchovies sardines sardines are really really good
[18445.35s -> 18447.35s]  If you can get over
[18447.43s -> 18450.87s]  What what it is you're doing right? You're eating they're just in a can
[18451.43s -> 18461.08s]  Did I just walk backwards while talking?
[18462.20s -> 18466.16s]  Oh, there it is ambrosia
[18466.76s -> 18470.76s]  The most delicious of the gods the most dessert that only the gods eat
[18472.36s -> 18475.24s]  Fruits covered in whipped cream and fucking marshmallows
[18476.26s -> 18478.26s]  Only the gods will eat this
[18479.64s -> 18482.44s]  And make sure make sure it's been sitting out for at least 12 hours
[18483.00s -> 18492.60s]  And by the way, even when you put it in the fridge in three or four days go by
[18493.24s -> 18498.20s]  Take it out of the container and just it's the same. It doesn't matter. We'll eat it a week later
[18499.08s -> 18513.43s]  for the gods though
[18513.43s -> 18515.43s]  little candied marshmallows
[18531.86s -> 18554.87s]  The mucky bag turn it on quick. You can pick it
[18559.81s -> 18579.49s]  Oh no
[18579.49s -> 18581.49s]  If you can get to an s rank combo, I will
[18581.97s -> 18587.00s]  Well, i'm gonna i'm not gonna read the first part but I want to tell you that i've done that probably 30 times already
[18587.08s -> 18598.98s]  So that's gonna happen. Oh, I want to try something. Can we try something weird?
[18599.22s -> 18602.45s]  That's gonna take some effort here. I want to try something
[18606.60s -> 18614.04s]  So this is a fun experiment that I've wanted to try for a little while. It doesn't work to this music though
[18614.20s -> 18616.20s]  It needs to be a little more relaxing
[18617.36s -> 18620.37s]  I want the mods to
[18621.15s -> 18623.03s]  record
[18623.03s -> 18623.83s]  with
[18623.83s -> 18627.27s]  You know to log all the responses and i'm curious if there's a
[18628.39s -> 18631.59s]  i'm curious if everybody sort of has something that they really care about
[18632.15s -> 18634.15s]  Or something that they really want right now
[18634.39s -> 18636.39s]  and without thinking
[18637.03s -> 18639.75s]  But what the fuck what the fuck? No, no, no, no, stop. Stop. Listen
[18640.39s -> 18642.55s]  Like this music is speech jamming me. Hold on. It's like
[18643.35s -> 18645.35s]  I hold on. Let me turn this off
[18650.29s -> 18654.37s]  So when we think i'm i'm gonna say something and I want after I say this
[18654.37s -> 18656.77s]  I want the mods to keep a record of what everybody says
[18657.75s -> 18665.78s]  Yeah, just like oh what just what everybody's saying after when I say this I want everybody to right now
[18666.84s -> 18668.32s]  think of
[18668.32s -> 18672.32s]  So something that you a food item it could be a snack
[18672.48s -> 18680.23s]  It could be a dessert something that you want right now so bad that you're craving right now that you
[18680.87s -> 18685.83s]  Not your favorite food, but just what do you want right now? What would just do it for you right now?
[18685.91s -> 18696.84s]  What would be that thing that would do it for you right now? Cool. Yeah, not your favorite food
[18696.92s -> 18700.66s]  Not oh, well my top 10 just you know do this for me right now
[18704.42s -> 18709.75s]  In an italian sub just a cold italian sub. I want it so bad
[18714.76s -> 18721.57s]  It's interesting the reason the reason why I wanted to do this is because i'm curious as to how many people here
[18722.05s -> 18724.05s]  Have the exact same
[18724.19s -> 18735.16s]  Omega craving right now. Do you know what i'm saying? Because that that that's cool
[18739.00s -> 18741.49s]  How do you want us to log this?
[18741.49s -> 18750.71s]  Um, yeah, I just copy and pasted me and and did you have something that's let's say you like man
[18750.71s -> 18752.55s]  This is really specific, but I really want it
[18752.55s -> 18758.92s]  Uh, I want a piece of baklava right now and it did more than three or four people say baklava
[18758.92s -> 18768.56s]  Because holy shit look at that. That's a pretty interesting connection. I thought about it because it's
[18769.36s -> 18775.65s]  Food is one of those things where you get these cravings. But what what right now? What do you want?
[18775.97s -> 18781.52s]  Somebody's like for instance somebody said everything bagel. That's a perfect example of this experiment
[18783.70s -> 18790.18s]  Was there anybody else that said everything bagel put it on a spreadsheet
[18790.34s -> 18791.76s]  Yeah
[18791.76s -> 18800.34s]  Yeah, let's get on a spreadsheet and then i'm gonna go over it on stream the next time and how many people said certain things?
[18801.17s -> 18803.35s]  Does pizza have a hundred?
[18803.83s -> 18811.12s]  Does pepperoni pizza have ten and what had the most what had the least don't really need usernames?
[18811.36s -> 18821.09s]  But the specific thing that really specific thing that you wanted right now. I'm curious. We'll see how it works
[18826.92s -> 18838.56s]  You know what else I want to do I here's another interesting thing going over your steam game library
[18839.92s -> 18845.52s]  In alphabetical order now i'm one of those people that has I have a lot of steam games
[18846.08s -> 18849.28s]  I've had a ton of steam games pretty much every game you've ever seen me play
[18849.94s -> 18856.52s]  On video or on stream whatever right but a lot of them are not a lot of them weren't but go alphabetical on steam
[18858.87s -> 18862.95s]  And pick out every single game that you've ever bought that you ever kept
[18864.21s -> 18869.86s]  Why like how did you feel when you played that game? Why did you buy it?
[18870.36s -> 18871.48s]  What did you think of it?
[18871.48s -> 18878.98s]  Because there's a lot of weird just random shit that I think a lot of people have bought and did you beat it?
[18879.46s -> 18889.96s]  Why didn't you? I think that's fun. I have like 200 games to laugh my ass off. Yeah, that's kind of cool
[18894.12s -> 18896.04s]  Did you start a google survey? Well, I don't want no no
[18896.04s -> 18897.48s]  I don't want you guys to all do this
[18897.48s -> 18901.72s]  I'm just saying maybe I think it might be fun to do that on stream one day and just go over them
[18906.82s -> 18909.41s]  I have 800 games. Well
[18910.48s -> 18911.44s]  It'll take you a while
[18911.44s -> 18916.05s]  But don't you think it's kind of interesting to go back and kind of look at especially if you have a steam account that's been
[18916.95s -> 18919.19s]  More than a few years five plus ten plus years old
[18920.66s -> 18924.74s]  You get to sort of look back and be like what the what the fuck was I thinking back then?
[18925.62s -> 18928.58s]  What was the reason why I bought this and did I get what I wanted out of it?
[18928.82s -> 18936.71s]  I think it's interesting to do that or even like how do you feel even looking at the name of that game?
[18937.17s -> 18949.65s]  Nostalgia trip. Yeah, because I could we'll do one right now like devil may cry three
[18950.53s -> 18953.57s]  Okay, it's a game that I got because I knew I wanted to play devil may cry
[18954.68s -> 18959.40s]  Uh, it was a fun hack and slash game. I never played devil may cry and it was interesting
[18959.40s -> 18961.00s]  I started with the third one
[18961.00s -> 18965.64s]  And that's where I stopped because I never played any of these other games ever again and I uninstalled this one
[18966.44s -> 18969.86s]  Um at the end of this stream, which is really interesting that I did that
[18970.68s -> 18975.62s]  Um makes you kind of think about how you approach things in the future
[18985.73s -> 18988.05s]  Surprise pop quiz. All right. Well, maybe I need to look
[18990.20s -> 18992.20s]  surprise pop quiz
[18992.44s -> 18999.54s]  All right. What am I doing here?
[18999.54s -> 19002.34s]  No, i'm gonna i'm this game. I'm having a good time. I'm kidding
[19005.73s -> 19011.25s]  Seven days to die me and my sister played it and we were like whack but kept playing it because she loved zombie games
[19012.93s -> 19014.93s]  There you go. Exactly
[19015.80s -> 19019.56s]  Thank you for proving why the experiment is an interesting thing to do
[19020.66s -> 19024.26s]  Look at that and didn't you do what? How does that make you feel?
[19024.98s -> 19027.80s]  Isn't that like interesting?
[19027.80s -> 19029.32s]  I just walked in
[19029.32s -> 19031.24s]  I'm walk. All right. I
[19031.24s -> 19040.36s]  Am I going the right way or i'm just being an idiot?
[19041.08s -> 19049.84s]  Did you just discover introspection?
[19051.22s -> 19055.46s]  No, but when was the last time you looked at a steam game that you bought like eight years ago?
[19057.97s -> 19059.97s]  I I mean it's been a while
[19066.02s -> 19076.40s]  I'll stay on trickster
[19076.40s -> 19078.00s]  Oh look at over there
[19078.00s -> 19082.36s]  I have a bunch of porn games
[19083.24s -> 19087.88s]  Well, we know exactly how you felt when you are, you know, do you need to even tell us that?
[19090.20s -> 19095.88s]  How did I feel when I downloaded this one? Hmm. What was I doing? What was I thinking?
[19097.64s -> 19099.08s]  Maybe
[19099.16s -> 19100.92s]  I guess this one was
[19100.92s -> 19103.24s]  Because I really wanted to work it, you know
[19104.36s -> 19106.36s]  Have a little bit of me time
[19106.36s -> 19108.92s]  Oh, this one is too. This one's also me time
[19109.56s -> 19121.73s]  Hmm
[19121.73s -> 19123.89s]  He's going off the rails. No, that was funny
[19135.75s -> 19138.47s]  I got this one because I wanted to fuck the cheeseburger sub
[19142.13s -> 19143.09s]  Yeah
[19143.09s -> 19148.09s]  I was laughing so hard at some of those conversations
[19148.79s -> 19150.15s]  yesterday
[19150.15s -> 19153.64s]  It's this fuck mary kill for sandwiches. That's
[19154.28s -> 19161.20s]  That's so stupid it was just it was killing me last night. I was just thinking about how dumb that was
[19170.61s -> 19176.05s]  The other people that weren't here
[19177.52s -> 19181.60s]  Mary kill, how would you uh, do I don't if I need to tell you that?
[19182.48s -> 19187.67s]  I mean, this is a mature audience stream. Are you really asking me how how?
[19188.55s -> 19210.69s]  What do you mean? How?
[19216.08s -> 19218.08s]  Hold on wait, wait, we got one here
[19218.24s -> 19223.91s]  Fuck mary kill cold italian sub turkey bacon club or tuna tuna fish sandwich
[19225.03s -> 19242.47s]  This is easy. I think my game crashed millennia

[20573.43s -> 20589.68s]  Why not? I still take way too much damage
[20592.86s -> 20604.48s]  Unfortunate. I want you to pay the subs you owe us. Oh, that's right
[20605.12s -> 20607.68s]  My credit card kept getting declined from twitch
[20608.50s -> 20611.46s]  And I just never did it. I tried it like five times and it never worked
[20615.68s -> 20617.68s]  That sounds like such a bullshit
[20618.16s -> 20621.73s]  If you think about it, but I assure you it is not
[20622.82s -> 20628.98s]  That sounds like total. Oh man. I tried but my credit card just didn't go through
[20630.26s -> 20633.56s]  It's something I don't know something with their servers
[20636.15s -> 20642.37s]  But I promise you it was real try it now
[20643.67s -> 20645.84s]  Um, that's a little late
[20646.08s -> 20648.48s]  I
[20648.48s -> 20652.80s]  Why does that matter? You know what it's because I don't want to go like get my credit card
[20653.52s -> 20662.16s]  We're about to end the stream
[20662.16s -> 20665.11s]  It's too late
[20665.11s -> 20668.79s]  Now remind me remind me when I turn this room on again. We'll do it
[20689.41s -> 20692.13s]  Are you going to give people the games we'll figure it out

[20718.00s -> 20725.73s]  I was wrong
[20752.82s -> 20757.06s]  Now that the final door is open I have no use for you
[20769.81s -> 20772.05s]  There we go mission 10
[20772.92s -> 20777.52s]  All right, and that's what we'll call it that is where we will call it

[20793.52s -> 20795.33s]  right, it's just
[20795.33s -> 20797.33s]  Decided hey, fuck it. Let's do it
[20801.52s -> 20804.88s]  You got another 30 minutes in yet? Uh, no, it's midnight
[20805.52s -> 20819.67s]  I think I think it's probably time to call it off mischief makers. Did I win?
[20821.83s -> 20823.35s]  I'm sorry
[20823.35s -> 20825.59s]  But it is when?
[20825.75s -> 20831.88s]  It is when we could see it in the chat. It is when we could see it in the chat room over was first

[20863.65s -> 20868.31s]  Right. Sometimes it's gonna be devil maker eyes might be something else random then
[20869.78s -> 20871.78s]  Just hang out and play just chill
[20874.53s -> 20878.53s]  I much prefer being able to do stuff like this more often way more often
[20881.14s -> 20887.20s]  So more of these you've already seen a bunch from already, but we're going to continue to do these
[20893.35s -> 20897.11s]  So let's talk about the next stream. I'm going to finish devil may cry 3
[20899.28s -> 20904.76s]  I will be live on friday and we'll probably do friday and
[20905.75s -> 20914.12s]  Probably friday saturday or friday sunday. I'll pick out a couple of days this weekend here friday sunday friday saturday
[20917.08s -> 20918.36s]  We will finish
[20918.36s -> 20921.33s]  devil may cry 3
[20921.33s -> 20923.89s]  And then on either saturday or sunday, we will move on to
[20924.61s -> 20932.13s]  I don't know. I got a list of a bunch of stuff. This game was on a list
[20932.13s -> 20938.74s]  Yeah, it was on my list all the devil may cries were. Oh, yeah the food result thing
[20938.74s -> 20951.89s]  I want to go over that on um on friday, too. I think we got we got everybody. All right
[20951.89s -> 20953.65s]  I think we got everybody that
[20953.65s -> 20954.37s]  um
[20954.37s -> 20959.44s]  Said the the name of the thing that I was saying the food thing is going to be a challenge
[20959.84s -> 20968.53s]  Maybe we just dump it in like a word file. It doesn't matter. All right, i'll see you guys later
[20970.00s -> 20972.18s]  If you stayed up late, have a good night
[20972.58s -> 20980.21s]  If you're just waking up have a good morning and if it's in the middle of the afternoon
[20980.61s -> 20997.24s]  Then get up and stretch and that's it. See you guys on friday
[20997.80s -> 21002.48s]  Great rest of your night. Thanks for watching devil may cry 3
[21003.04s -> 21011.72s]  Very hard, but I get it. I get it. So let me ask you this
[21011.80s -> 21017.40s]  I know a lot of people here are probably big fans of this game. What's the best devil may cry in your opinion?
[21017.88s -> 21023.22s]  What is the is it this one? Is it five the three five?
[21024.16s -> 21041.92s]  One there was a lot of debate in the pre-stream of is five the best one we need music
[21042.64s -> 21074.21s]  I got you got you. I got you right here. Hold on four is underrated. It's pretty good
[21077.35s -> 21081.57s]  Hanging out an offline chat earlier. I put a poll up to see what people were thinking
[21082.29s -> 21087.22s]  I think only two people voted for four out of a couple hundred responses
[21093.49s -> 21101.12s]  Yeah, four is good, but five is just so much better
[21101.92s -> 21112.93s]  So what's the deal with the first one then because everybody said no, no, no, no do not play the first one. It is way different
[21113.57s -> 21116.04s]  You're gonna hate it
[21116.04s -> 21129.46s]  What's the um, what's the deal? It's just very dated very old. I mean, it's got to be
[21131.84s -> 21134.14s]  2002
[21134.16s -> 21136.16s]  2003 or something for devil may cry 1
[21136.72s -> 21141.49s]  Or was that still in playstation 1 was it ps2?
[21148.06s -> 21150.05s]  2001
[21150.05s -> 21164.48s]  Wow, it was originally resident evil 4
[21168.08s -> 21173.96s]  What hold on?
[21174.04s -> 21179.24s]  I mean you've got now i'm intrigued. I need to know what that is. It was gonna be a resident evil game
[21180.04s -> 21182.28s]  That's cool. All right, I kind of want to check it out
[21187.70s -> 21189.70s]  Same director is resident evil 2
[21189.70s -> 21195.46s]  Re4 had a lot of revisions
[21204.04s -> 21207.48s]  Have any advice on how to make colonoscopy prep more palatable?
[21208.12s -> 21212.44s]  You talk about drinking the the gross drink that makes you like shit for fucking three days
[21214.20s -> 21216.37s]  um
[21216.37s -> 21218.45s]  Yeah, you know what? I'll tell you that's the worst part
[21221.46s -> 21226.92s]  That's actually the worst part and that part sucks. Don't get me wrong
[21228.80s -> 21231.36s]  But for a colonoscopy colonoscopy is not
[21232.66s -> 21236.34s]  It's that is is simple the procedure is simple
[21238.40s -> 21240.40s]  It's just that
[21240.40s -> 21242.56s]  Drinking the drink in eating the thing
[21243.36s -> 21245.60s]  To clear you out. That's the actual worst part
[21247.16s -> 21248.50s]  so
[21248.50s -> 21250.50s]  You are doing the worst part right now
[21250.82s -> 21256.21s]  So when you're done with that and you get the few days you have to do it
[21256.85s -> 21258.61s]  On that last day
[21258.61s -> 21260.63s]  Just look in the mirror and go
[21260.63s -> 21262.47s]  Now it's time for the easy stuff
[21262.47s -> 21271.46s]  Because it actually is
[21271.46s -> 21277.88s]  Yeah, it sucks. But you know, you gotta take care of yourself. Do what you gotta do, right? Do what you gotta do
[21282.24s -> 21284.18s]  Thanks doc
[21284.18s -> 21296.68s]  Yeah, and then go get a large iced coffee
[21298.44s -> 21302.15s]  Uh, that's funny
[21302.15s -> 21305.27s]  I did say I was gonna puke blood today. Yeah, but that was just
[21305.91s -> 21308.50s]  That was just nonsense
[21308.50s -> 21313.67s]  All right. I'll see you guys later. See you friday. Thanks for watching. Take care call your mother
[21314.39s -> 21319.89s]  I mean especially if you didn't call your mother a few days ago
[21320.69s -> 21333.00s]  But now
[21333.00s -> 21335.00s]  Have a good one. Good night. Goodbye
[21335.40s -> 21337.40s]  See you soon
