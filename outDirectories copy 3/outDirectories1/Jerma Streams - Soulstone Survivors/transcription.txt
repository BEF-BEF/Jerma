[4.54s -> 9.19s]  Stream is gonna, uh, get kind of killed here because I'm about to download this.
[9.19s -> 12.36s]  By the way, if you notice that no drop frames at all, it's been a perfect stream.
[12.36s -> 18.31s]  Uh, I'm not streaming to the server that I- I did- I did a server hopscotch and then found one.
[18.31s -> 37.59s]  So, we're good. But it's gonna be a little slow for a sec. I think we're good.
[37.59s -> 43.90s]  Alright, Soul Stone Surv- Wait, did this actually- did this win?
[43.90s -> 46.94s]  I forgot again. It's the third time I've asked. What won the poll?
[46.94s -> 49.40s]  Okay, I gotta close out of this.
[50.04s -> 53.91s]  That was Pac-Man World. Pretty cool.
[53.91s -> 71.56s]  Can I use the controller for this?
[71.56s -> 78.73s]  Soul Stone Survivors. Give it a shot.
[78.73s -> 111.21s]  Is this game good? Okay.
[111.21s -> 117.58s]  Fight. Character. I can do Barbarian.
[117.58s -> 121.54s]  Pyromancer. Houndmaster.
[121.54s -> 123.85s]  Alright. 15% crit damage.
[123.85s -> 128.76s]  Armor power. Attack speed multiplier.
[128.76s -> 134.15s]  Movement speed multiplier. Alright. Crit damage. Damage multiplier.
[134.15s -> 137.21s]  Alright, let's do this one.
[137.21s -> 139.45s]  Blacksmith. Uh, whatever. I don't care.
[139.45s -> 141.96s]  I'll figure it out as I go here.
[141.96s -> 143.64s]  Skill tree? Oh, cool. That's alright.
[143.64s -> 145.50s]  Alright, cool. Let's just play.
[145.50s -> 150.20s]  Fight. Wait. Alright.
[150.20s -> 154.26s]  The Scorching Valley. Yeah, let's go.
[154.74s -> 162.42s]  Oh, the title says Pac-Man Party. Oops.
[162.42s -> 164.55s]  This is- this is not- this is not sponsored.
[164.55s -> 170.14s]  Hold on. Gotta change the title.
[170.14s -> 181.03s]  Um, trying this new game. What is that?
[181.03s -> 182.47s]  There we go. Trying this new game.
[182.47s -> 188.66s]  So how does this work? So I can- I can aim?
[188.66s -> 195.50s]  I don't think it matters if I aim, right?
[195.50s -> 201.88s]  I do have something I want to change.
[201.88s -> 205.75s]  That's fine. This has to come down.
[205.75s -> 210.22s]  General, uh, alright. Yeah. Graphics. Make sure they're good.
[210.22s -> 211.99s]  Looks good. Alright, we're good.
[211.99s -> 216.12s]  That's one of the- I just didn't want the- it was kind of the music was loud.
[216.12s -> 220.15s]  Alright, let's go.
[220.15s -> 222.15s]  So just like Vampire Survivors, you pick up this stuff.
[238.73s -> 240.09s]  This- this feels pretty- kind of fun.
[240.09s -> 241.21s]  Let's see. We'll- we'll give it a shot.
[250.79s -> 251.59s]  Alright, just leveled up.
[252.54s -> 253.98s]  Do I have to press a button? Oh, R.
[255.08s -> 255.96s]  Oh, it pauses. Okay.
[256.68s -> 261.72s]  Multicast. Increases the chance of activating all your skills multiple times by 16%.
[261.72s -> 264.63s]  Increases your block power.
[264.63s -> 268.07s]  Creates four fiery orbs that rotate around you, causing 40 damage and applying burn.
[268.07s -> 268.79s]  Probably this.
[268.79s -> 270.62s]  But these are- this is epic.
[270.62s -> 278.63s]  Should I do it?
[278.63s -> 280.87s]  Uh, I guess I'll just turn that on.
[280.87s -> 287.38s]  So there's a 16% chance- chance- chance- I'd spe-
[288.10s -> 292.26s]  There's a- there's a 16% chance that I will do this twice.
[292.26s -> 293.22s]  Like, back whack.
[297.42s -> 298.78s]  What the hell is- wait, is that it?
[299.66s -> 300.62s]  Am I- is that me doing that?
[311.00s -> 311.56s]  There it is.
[311.56s -> 312.60s]  Okay, yeah, so that's what it is.
[312.60s -> 313.24s]  That's pretty cool.
[314.12s -> 314.92s]  Can that be upgraded?
[315.64s -> 330.02s]  Oh my god, dude, it proc.
[334.82s -> 337.24s]  Okay, fire bolt.
[337.24s -> 340.36s]  Shoots a fire projectile and I think I need more damage moves.
[348.23s -> 349.83s]  Oh, I can see the- at the cooldown.
[353.56s -> 354.60s]  Oh, I'm gonna die.
[375.48s -> 376.68s]  Oh, I got level- I got two levels up.
[377.24s -> 379.72s]  This is a- this looks like roblox.
[379.72s -> 382.36s]  It doesn't- it does not look like roblox or stuff.
[383.82s -> 389.53s]  Ooh, that's pretty huge.
[389.53s -> 399.62s]  Yep, that's gonna make my fireball bigger.
[399.62s -> 406.41s]  Yep.
[406.41s -> 410.49s]  Um, let me alone, please.
[411.13s -> 423.98s]  You need- you can dash?
[425.27s -> 426.31s]  Oh, I can dash.
[426.87s -> 428.15s]  All right, that's good to know.
[428.15s -> 438.12s]  Thank you without so many crunchies over here.
[438.68s -> 445.08s]  All right, I hit the ground in front of you calling a thunderstrike,
[445.08s -> 447.32s]  dealing 350 damage and applying stun.
[447.32s -> 452.95s]  Skeletal Warth Rust.
[452.95s -> 458.17s]  Are you gonna play Nokia Snake?
[458.17s -> 459.21s]  That game was awesome.
[459.21s -> 461.43s]  Which one of these should I do?
[461.43s -> 462.15s]  Which one's good?
[462.15s -> 462.95s]  Skeletons?
[462.95s -> 467.10s]  Okay.
[467.10s -> 472.31s]  Here's the damage of units summoned by the Skeletal Warrior skill by 20%.
[472.31s -> 472.87s]  Let's do it.
[472.87s -> 479.62s]  Here's the attack speed of the firebolt skill.
[479.62s -> 480.50s]  That's pretty good.
[480.50s -> 482.57s]  That's probably better.
[482.57s -> 483.54s]  That means it can happen.
[483.54s -> 484.66s]  Yeah, let's do this one.
[484.66s -> 489.34s]  Wait, this left one.
[489.34s -> 491.69s]  All right, let's go.
[491.69s -> 504.14s]  Skeletons seem very good.
[504.14s -> 509.99s]  Eliminate Columeth, the avatar of ice.
[509.99s -> 510.49s]  Okay.
[510.95s -> 516.79s]  Meteor?
[516.79s -> 517.35s]  Yeah.
[517.35s -> 520.02s]  Wait, this one's probably better.
[520.02s -> 524.90s]  Yeah, because it does my, uh, summons too, right?
[524.90s -> 545.72s]  Hell yeah.
[545.72s -> 551.18s]  Eliminate more monsters.
[551.18s -> 552.62s]  Okay, I got five lords.
[555.88s -> 556.38s]  Ooh.
[556.92s -> 557.48s]  All right, hold on.
[563.05s -> 564.73s]  What is the blue thing that's going to be?
[564.73s -> 566.97s]  Is that, see like the blue shards?
[566.97s -> 576.97s]  Is that, that's pretty good.
[576.97s -> 581.29s]  Is this like Vampire Survivors where I could only have six weapons and six items?
[581.29s -> 585.64s]  I don't know.
[585.64s -> 596.07s]  Maybe?
[596.07s -> 596.63s]  I don't know.
[596.63s -> 604.22s]  Yeah.
[604.22s -> 604.94s]  This one?
[604.94s -> 612.28s]  This one?
[612.28s -> 613.08s]  All right, let's go.
[613.08s -> 618.26s]  I love this game.
[618.26s -> 618.90s]  Is it good?
[618.90s -> 626.94s]  I mean, I, it feels pretty, it feels pretty good for a game that, you know, is
[627.50s -> 631.99s]  very obviously directly inspired by, you know,
[632.63s -> 634.47s]  this type of game, right?
[635.11s -> 640.66s]  I don't know, you know, Vampire Survivors is a really popular one, but it,
[640.66s -> 642.18s]  was there anything before Vampire Survivors?
[642.90s -> 650.79s]  But Vampire Survivors kind of, uh, pull a, um, like a genre creator.
[651.43s -> 665.35s]  Yeah, I feel like I've seen games like this before.
[665.35s -> 668.10s]  They just weren't as good as Vampire Survivors.
[668.10s -> 674.12s]  They just weren't even close for me.
[674.12s -> 674.68s]  Crit.
[674.68s -> 679.67s]  You and your nearby allies, all damage done by 40%.
[679.67s -> 688.97s]  Oh my God.
[688.97s -> 694.26s]  Okay.
[694.26s -> 695.06s]  Doom.
[695.06s -> 697.93s]  How about just, no, let's go with attack speed.
[701.05s -> 702.81s]  20 minutes till dawn does it best.
[702.81s -> 704.01s]  I never heard of that.
[704.01s -> 704.65s]  Is it good?
[704.65s -> 714.63s]  What happened to Pac-Man?
[714.63s -> 715.43s]  Oh, really weird.
[715.43s -> 723.08s]  We got to the end and, uh, mechanical evil Pac-Man, uh,
[723.08s -> 726.60s]  eats regular Pac-Man and like chews him up and like bone crunching sounds happen.
[726.60s -> 727.56s]  It was really fucked up.
[745.10s -> 751.83s]  I think somebody wrote, AKA, it sucked.
[754.50s -> 755.70s]  It did not suck.
[756.42s -> 758.02s]  That's unfair to Pac-Man.
[758.02s -> 760.10s]  It wasn't, I am being genuine.
[761.06s -> 762.50s]  It was a very nice game.
[763.14s -> 763.94s]  It was polished.
[764.50s -> 765.46s]  It was fun.
[765.46s -> 766.18s]  It was fine.
[766.18s -> 766.74s]  It was okay.
[767.78s -> 777.19s]  All right.
[777.19s -> 778.15s]  What do I have?
[778.15s -> 783.24s]  There's so many moves.
[783.24s -> 784.92s]  Thunder.
[784.92s -> 785.96s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[785.96s -> 790.01s]  Cancel.
[790.01s -> 790.57s]  Replace.
[790.57s -> 801.32s]  Wait, do I have any of these?
[801.32s -> 810.97s]  Um, oh shit.
[810.97s -> 811.61s]  Okay.
[811.61s -> 824.30s]  Should I, this one looks pretty good.
[824.30s -> 826.94s]  Chain Lightning looks kind of good.
[826.94s -> 830.60s]  Uh, I'm going to replace, I don't know.
[830.60s -> 833.51s]  What should I replace?
[833.51s -> 838.41s]  Can I just skip?
[838.41s -> 847.62s]  That's too many words.
[847.62s -> 848.82s]  Just click the coolest image.
[848.82s -> 849.06s]  Okay.
[849.06s -> 849.54s]  This one.
[849.54s -> 854.70s]  I'll get rid of this.
[854.70s -> 855.50s]  This thing sucks.
[855.50s -> 874.47s]  I don't think it was actually, that thing was actually the only thing killing anything.
[874.47s -> 885.93s]  No, the skeleton's still.
[885.93s -> 887.85s]  Look at all the synergies I have with the skeletons.
[887.85s -> 890.01s]  I think it's pretty good.
[890.01s -> 899.37s]  Is this sponsored?
[900.62s -> 902.06s]  No, it was, you guys voted for this.
[904.33s -> 905.85s]  Chat, we got complainers in the chat.
[905.85s -> 908.33s]  Wait, we got, we got, we got chat complainer randies.
[909.05s -> 912.34s]  I mean, you guys, you guys voted for this.
[914.41s -> 914.89s]  It's fun.
[915.53s -> 916.41s]  What are you, what are you on about?
[917.13s -> 936.07s]  I mean, just like in Vampire Survivors, if I knew what kind of was good with what,
[936.79s -> 938.25s]  that's how you figure it out.
[938.25s -> 940.57s]  You just play and you lose and you come back and you try again.
[943.10s -> 944.68s]  All right.
[944.68s -> 946.71s]  Um, there's even more.
[946.71s -> 950.36s]  Should I do?
[950.36s -> 951.48s]  I want this.
[951.48s -> 954.09s]  Um, shit.
[954.09s -> 957.14s]  I have so many items down here.
[957.14s -> 963.02s]  I just don't know what you want to do.
[963.02s -> 968.38s]  That's definitely awesome.
[968.38s -> 972.18s]  That's good too.
[972.18s -> 973.06s]  That's good.
[973.06s -> 979.50s]  How do you feel about hard seltzer?
[979.50s -> 981.35s]  It's okay.
[981.35s -> 999.42s]  Skeletal archers.
[999.98s -> 1000.54s]  Oh shit.
[1000.54s -> 1000.86s]  All right.
[1000.86s -> 1003.86s]  I definitely need to replace this.
[1003.86s -> 1004.74s]  Uh, this one.
[1004.74s -> 1018.50s]  We're going full skeletons here.
[1018.50s -> 1020.84s]  That's very frustrated.
[1020.84s -> 1025.67s]  Um, oh, go get the, get Taco Bell.
[1025.67s -> 1029.24s]  The guy that asked that question an hour ago.
[1029.24s -> 1032.52s]  Right now he's just sitting there in a bite of his, of his McDonald's burger going.
[1032.52s -> 1035.21s]  Fuck an asshole.
[1035.21s -> 1044.36s]  He's starved.
[1044.36s -> 1047.00s]  All right.
[1047.00s -> 1047.56s]  What's this boss?
[1047.56s -> 1057.30s]  I can get him.
[1057.30s -> 1069.42s]  I'm going to die.
[1069.42s -> 1070.94s]  Well, there's so much shit going on.
[1070.94s -> 1071.18s]  All right.
[1071.18s -> 1071.74s]  I got it.
[1071.74s -> 1078.94s]  Crit damage.
[1078.94s -> 1080.71s]  Skeletal mage.
[1080.71s -> 1084.18s]  We're going to replace this with this.
[1087.88s -> 1088.84s]  Six percent more damage.
[1089.66s -> 1091.56s]  I'm just looking at all this stuff.
[1091.56s -> 1094.12s]  Um, attack speed.
[1094.12s -> 1097.56s]  Um, do I, do I have any of these?
[1097.56s -> 1098.12s]  No.
[1098.12s -> 1125.86s]  You don't have an attack.
[1127.75s -> 1128.15s]  That's fine.
[1128.15s -> 1128.95s]  I got these skeletons.
[1128.95s -> 1130.07s]  The skeletons are wiping up.
[1130.63s -> 1134.62s]  I don't need to have an attack myself.
[1134.62s -> 1135.58s]  Skeletons are doing it for me.
[1136.14s -> 1137.98s]  I got a McDonald's happy meal.
[1137.98s -> 1138.94s]  That's not enough food for me.
[1139.66s -> 1142.06s]  I could probably eat five McDonald's happy meals.
[1142.06s -> 1143.34s]  I probably, I'm, I probably could.
[1144.14s -> 1147.42s]  If you gave me 40 minutes,
[1147.42s -> 1149.34s]  I could probably eat five McDonald's happy meals.
[1149.34s -> 1165.24s]  They're going to walk the skeletons into people.
[1169.00s -> 1169.72s]  40 minutes?
[1171.83s -> 1172.79s]  Yeah, I don't think it would take.
[1172.79s -> 1174.47s]  It's one single cheeseburger, guys.
[1175.19s -> 1178.89s]  Isn't a McDonald's happy meal one single cheeseburger
[1180.28s -> 1183.24s]  and a little small fry or an apple slice or something?
[1184.20s -> 1184.84s]  Or nuggets?
[1185.56s -> 1187.94s]  Guys, I could eat 20 nuggets.
[1189.61s -> 1190.01s]  My eyes.
[1190.97s -> 1191.45s]  That would take me.
[1191.45s -> 1192.25s]  It would be so simple.
[1198.14s -> 1199.66s]  I could eat five full happy meals.
[1200.22s -> 1208.82s]  What about the drinks?
[1209.46s -> 1212.04s]  I mean, I don't think it's fair to include all the drinks
[1212.92s -> 1214.52s]  because that's just liquid that you can't.
[1214.52s -> 1216.54s]  It's not too much liquid.
[1217.26s -> 1224.10s]  I don't think I could do 10.
[1224.10s -> 1224.90s]  I know I could do five.
[1225.62s -> 1227.51s]  I think about it.
[1227.51s -> 1229.99s]  Two double cheeseburgers from McDonald's is four patties.
[1230.71s -> 1232.23s]  There's four burgers right there.
[1233.03s -> 1234.95s]  I know the bread too, but I'll be fine.
[1235.75s -> 1238.79s]  You can't.
[1238.79s -> 1239.27s]  Yes, I can.
[1239.99s -> 1247.32s]  You don't eat the toy.
[1247.32s -> 1248.36s]  What are you talking about?
[1248.36s -> 1256.22s]  Yep.
[1256.22s -> 1261.75s]  All right.
[1261.75s -> 1263.19s]  I don't think I'm lasting very long here.
[1263.19s -> 1263.91s]  I think I'm dead here.
[1264.71s -> 1269.86s]  That's it.
[1269.86s -> 1270.26s]  All right.
[1270.82s -> 1271.78s]  So now what?
[1271.78s -> 1277.45s]  Oh, actually, I have money.
[1283.91s -> 1284.47s]  Blacksmith.
[1285.54s -> 1286.50s]  Oh, I see.
