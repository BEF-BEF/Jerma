[1.59s -> 10.42s]  How you doing? How are you doing? How are you? Good to see you again. You know who I am. Welcome
[10.42s -> 15.30s]  back to the channel. My name is German on eight five and we've got quite a day for you today.
[16.42s -> 22.25s]  Tonight got a few things to talk about. We'll go over them one by one really quickly. Already
[22.25s -> 33.64s]  got a plus two, which means this is funny to somebody. What's up? So we had to change some
[33.64s -> 40.73s]  plans today because I originally was going to play GTA online, but I was told
[41.13s -> 45.93s]  into some research and I was shown a few things. That's just kind of impossible.
[49.08s -> 53.72s]  It's isn't it apparently one of the easiest things in the world to just like get into a
[53.72s -> 59.58s]  GTA online lobby and just like break it. So I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that.
[60.38s -> 64.94s]  Unless there's a different solution on maybe a private server or something. I don't know.
[66.50s -> 72.66s]  It's apparently very easy to get into games that people are in. There's a lot of like IP problems,
[72.66s -> 76.50s]  I think, and even just getting into the server itself. People can just kind of get in and
[79.13s -> 82.57s]  hack. I don't know. I don't know anything about it. It's just, it's apparently hard to do.
[86.17s -> 96.17s]  It's a scary hacker word. A hacker. I don't know. Oh, instead of that, you're a liar.
[97.05s -> 105.02s]  What? This is documented evidence. What are you talking about? I'm a liar. You're a liar.
[110.41s -> 117.51s]  If two cars crash into each other and you ask me, what happened? And I say, although that was a car
[117.51s -> 124.70s]  accident. Liar. What? It's two cars. That's just factual information sitting in front of you.
[126.22s -> 136.31s]  You're a liar. No, I'm just processing the information. Anyways, if I get another question
[136.31s -> 144.07s]  mark, I'm ending the stream. It's over if I get another question mark. Just in how it's looking
[144.07s -> 150.58s]  over there and seeing that, how upset that makes me. Question mark, question mark, question mark.
[150.58s -> 157.30s]  I know what I'm talking about. I'm an adult. I'm 36 years old. I know what I'm talking about.
[157.30s -> 164.31s]  I don't want to see that anymore. I don't like those question marks. Maybe be unhappy.
[168.01s -> 174.65s]  This sounds fake. It's all fake. Everything is fake here. Except for 5% of the time when it's not.
[175.45s -> 179.61s]  All right. No more stalling. Let's go. So instead of that, I'm not going to do GTA online. It's not
[179.61s -> 185.21s]  going to happen. I'll have to figure out something else to do with GTA if I ever do it. I've been
[185.21s -> 190.50s]  asked to do the last few months now, the last at least couple of months, a couple of Jerma
[191.22s -> 198.42s]  Universe fan games I've shown themselves on Steam. And apparently a couple of them are very much
[198.42s -> 204.74s]  elaborately well made. So I was like, why not? Why don't we check these out? So we're going to do the
[204.74s -> 213.22s]  fan games. And then we'll be back on Sunday as well. I'm going to stream Sunday. And let me tell
[213.22s -> 220.62s]  you, I've been doing some meetings and talking back and forth a few times with different people.
[221.98s -> 228.95s]  There is some exciting shit coming up in the next hopefully six months or so.
[228.95s -> 236.94s]  Some more exciting shit that is currently starting. We're having meetings. There's meetings.
[236.94s -> 247.35s]  You understand? I'm having meetings with people. Community Jake. I'm hopeful there's going to be
[247.35s -> 254.34s]  some really fun shit to do soon. Isn't it Sandy? Yeah. That's what I'm trying. Let's go.
[255.14s -> 260.90s]  I'm very excited today. You probably hear it in the sound of my voice. I am very excited.
[261.91s -> 273.59s]  The horizon is bright. It looks great. So let's just hang out for a little bit. I'll be back on
[273.59s -> 277.99s]  Sunday. Let's do this. This is Jerma's Big Adventure. The first one we're going to do.
[278.71s -> 286.68s]  This is it right here. I don't know if I need to play this with a controller, but I'm going to.
[288.90s -> 293.37s]  He isn't retiring. Not yet. No, not yet. That's still important work to do.
[295.62s -> 300.58s]  I'm the ghost that lives in everybody's house. There's still important work to do. I can't leave
[300.58s -> 321.35s]  yet. Not yet. Okay. This is a banger. No, don't call the Ghostbusters. I'm haunting your computer.
[321.35s -> 328.97s]  I'm not haunting you. All right. You guys ready? This is Jerma's Big Adventure.
[329.53s -> 340.82s]  Go ahead. Okay. Start. You ready? I'm ready. I'm excited. I think this is a side scroller.
[348.09s -> 366.57s]  I could be, I could be 10 feet tall. All right. Honey, hold E to tell a joke.
[370.79s -> 376.34s]  Okay. Good. Good. Good. Use A. Do I need to use A? Oh, wait. I could.
[378.55s -> 389.13s]  Oh my God. This is so stupid. Okay. What does it tell a joke? Is there a jump? Hold. Okay. To
[389.13s -> 397.19s]  tell a joke. Okay. Audience loved it. It's got controller support. That's how you know it's,
[397.19s -> 407.83s]  this is a real deal. Is there a jump? There is a jump. Tell another joke. This is so accurate.
[410.38s -> 416.71s]  Do not enter. Should I go in there? Look how sweaty I was. Hold. All right. Hold.
[416.71s -> 429.93s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken. He has three jokes. No, four. I walk funny. Is it like, is it like a
[429.93s -> 447.99s]  currency thing? Let me turn this up. Stop. Turn back. Uh oh. Dead end. Do not enter. Fall hazard.
[447.99s -> 460.41s]  Keep out. That's not that high, right? It's not about that high up. Jump in it? Fall joke. Hold
[460.41s -> 483.24s]  on. Wait, wait, wait. Jerma goes to undertale. Did you see my underwear? What is that?
[486.30s -> 501.29s]  What is that on my stomach? Okay. Apparently I was streaming outside.
[511.50s -> 517.30s]  I got an achievement. The achievement was actually called fall joke. Somebody liked it. Good. All
[517.30s -> 526.04s]  right. It's your thong. Joke charge meter. Charges with attacks. Tell a joke to heal.
[526.52s -> 544.60s]  The ooey gooey cheesy. Oh man. Okay. Do I have full health? I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta get
[544.60s -> 553.62s]  out of here. I gotta get out of here, man. I gotta go. Is this what I'm like? Oh, this is a new
[553.62s -> 564.15s]  movement. This is actually hold to jump higher. Is this like a, is this like a Metroidvania?
[564.79s -> 576.54s]  Should I tell more jokes? Oh, I can't. I love how I'm doing the I'm falling thing every time I jump.
[578.97s -> 589.16s]  Oh, log. Oh, yeah. Loot get. Got it. Now I'm assuming this is my attack. How do I attack?
[592.30s -> 611.43s]  Right trigger to swing or right bumper. This is crazy. Hold to heal. Okay. So let's keep going.
[611.43s -> 625.13s]  Are there enemies in the game? Do I have to fight actual enemies? Why am I running like this? I'm
[625.13s -> 635.78s]  running like an absolute shithead. Ace wall while falling to grab edge. I promise I don't actually
[635.78s -> 641.10s]  run like this in real life. I can run actually pretty fast and well press it and hold jump to
[641.10s -> 648.44s]  boost jump off an edge. That's, that's copium. No, I'm serious. I don't run like this. I think
[648.44s -> 653.16s]  you've probably, you guys have seen me run. I don't run with like my neck out like that.
[653.16s -> 663.90s]  That was definitely for a joke. All right. Duck. All right. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool.
[664.62s -> 676.30s]  Checkpoint reached. Are they bosses? Robot dinos danger. I have an ad for Fortnite on my screen
[676.30s -> 704.52s]  right now and I don't even have the raptor. Okay. They have lasers reflect projectile.
[706.68s -> 717.11s]  All right. That onion ring. I got an onion ring. What people already loves that one. What are you
[717.11s -> 725.51s]  talking about? That's like everybody's favorite. They can be bad jokes and I don't get healed.
[725.51s -> 735.91s]  Oh shit. Oh my God. This is actually a video game now. Oh, I can't. Oh, that's how many hits it
[735.91s -> 754.66s]  takes. There we go. All right. Good. You like that one. Marvelous. Ow. Okay. I got six squares.
[758.68s -> 764.44s]  This music too. Listen to this. Like you're already here watching. Why do I have to do that?
[764.44s -> 768.84s]  Why am I saying? I don't know why I do that. I am the annoying person. I'm sorry. Is it like,
[768.84s -> 773.99s]  is it like a currency thing? I'm the annoying guy at the movie or in the game that says,
[774.07s -> 783.21s]  Hey, look, you watch this part. I know I'm already doing it. Can you aim it? Can I aim it? Like
[783.21s -> 799.66s]  angle it? I can. All right. Use L and press. Okay. So I can aim the bat up or down. What?
[800.22s -> 810.58s]  This is genuinely a good game. I mean, it kind of is. How many remaining? Oh, I have to kill them
[810.58s -> 826.81s]  all. I see. Oh shit. I swing that way. I don't think I can swing to my left. Can I? I can't
[826.81s -> 840.23s]  swing left. This is the best game to screen because the game streams for me. I don't even
[840.23s -> 856.82s]  do anything. This is awesome. I barely even have to say anything. Why didn't I do this before?
[857.46s -> 867.53s]  All right. Here we go. This definitely bosses too. I can't wait. It's doing all the old hits.
[868.57s -> 881.08s]  All right. I got to watch out. So that's funny. That's funny. I like that one. That's not minus
[881.08s -> 886.81s]  two. That's a good one. Oh, I can't. It has to be charged up. I see. All right. All right.
[886.81s -> 903.85s]  I see. All right. I got to be careful. Pull them down here. There we go. Zonked. You need
[903.85s -> 910.81s]  more German juice for jokes. Oh, I see. I just get the hitting boxes and stuff. The giant enemy
[910.81s -> 926.23s]  spider. I love this. This is exactly what I'm looking for. Damn it. Head end down. Okay. Where?
[926.95s -> 931.13s]  Exit. Should I wait? Should I explore? Are there secrets? There's definitely secrets.
[931.13s -> 945.48s]  What am I kidding? Are there secrets? Yep. There it is. There's got to be Easter eggs.
[945.48s -> 961.88s]  I got to find all the Easter eggs. Did I miss a secret? Is it fall damage? No. It's not Easter.
[963.90s -> 975.82s]  Get at it. Can I go up there? There's a little divot right there. Can I go up here? Oh, I can go
[975.82s -> 989.90s]  up here. So what is this? Okay. This is all this caution symbols. What does that mean?
[992.54s -> 1003.82s]  Exit. Exit. Exit. Exit. How do I get up there? How do I get up there? This is, I'm telling you,
[1003.82s -> 1018.82s]  this is a Metroidvania. I can't make it from here. Holy shit. Okay. That works. You go so much further
[1018.82s -> 1028.95s]  when you do a roll. Oh, fuck. Hold on. I'll get it. Is there a double jump? No, the roll jump works.
[1029.51s -> 1039.69s]  That's a Donkey Kong strat. Oh, come on. Do I have to get out of the roll to grab the edge?
[1044.28s -> 1046.12s]  Yeah. You have to get out of the roll to grab. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Wait,
[1046.12s -> 1065.00s]  wait, wait. There we go. You can't be rolling. All right. What do I get? Okay. All right. Somebody
[1065.00s -> 1082.86s]  liked that. Good. That was worth two funny points. Head to the exit. All right. Cool. Cool. Now what?
[1088.34s -> 1105.32s]  Robot dinos again. Oh, I have to activate all these with lasers. Oh shit. Okay. Can I flip it?
[1105.32s -> 1118.25s]  No. I hit that one. Thank you. Oh God. I did it. That's exactly what I had to do. Right here. Come
[1118.25s -> 1140.44s]  here. Up here. Keep going higher. Do to me up here. No, I'm not going to kill the raptors and
[1140.44s -> 1156.02s]  softlock myself. Fuck. I actually might've just ruined it. Oh, I got it. Oh, get out of here.
[1157.96s -> 1180.76s]  Shoot. Oh my God. He actually hit me. Any more there? Right here. There's only one more, right?
[1181.48s -> 1199.64s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You shoot up here. Wait, I can, I can deflect it. Does it
[1199.64s -> 1210.95s]  count? Oh, it does. Okay. I thought it turned to green. Do I need to kill them? I think I can
[1210.95s -> 1233.10s]  just leave. I don't want to miss the EXP. Secret. Is there one here? I, okay. That's not me saying
[1233.10s -> 1248.39s]  yeah, right? That's somebody else. I think I can get up there. No, no, I can't. It's not, that's not
[1248.39s -> 1256.57s]  me. Oh, there are warlocks now. And you know what? I guarantee I know what it is. I guarantee it's
[1256.57s -> 1262.26s]  going to be when I had the Harry Potter stuff on. It's definitely Harry Potter. Yep. It's going to
[1262.26s -> 1303.80s]  be the shock warlock. Is he stunned? How do I even react to this? This is so bizarre. It's,
[1303.88s -> 1313.05s]  it's so cool though. God, I would have loved to be like a warlock. You know what I mean?
[1313.93s -> 1330.58s]  I know he's high again. What do you mean? What? I don't know. If like magic was real, it'd be cool
[1330.58s -> 1339.45s]  to be like a warlock. I don't want to be the guy with the axe that runs up to people. Everyone's
[1339.45s -> 1344.01s]  like, oh man, I would be like a melee. No, no. What the hell is wrong with you? I mean, you can
[1344.01s -> 1347.69s]  have like, you can conjure demons and like stay at a distance and shoot shadow bolts at people.
[1348.73s -> 1355.10s]  Why the fuck would you ever want to have an axe in your hand? That's horrible.
[1355.10s -> 1372.44s]  Why can't you be both? You don't have skill points. Are you serious?
[1377.16s -> 1389.42s]  Hold on. I'm going to die. I'm going to die here. I'm going to die here. So what happens when you
[1389.42s -> 1404.97s]  die? What to menu? No restart from the checkpoint. Let's go. 5,000 hours in Isaac, by the way.
[1405.69s -> 1417.80s]  Yeah. Over the course of 10 years. Okay. During the smite scream, we already went over this.
[1418.60s -> 1424.84s]  You, if you are not actively playing a video game, you, it takes like weeks to get back into it and
[1424.84s -> 1430.98s]  get back to where you were. It's like, it's like the gym. You can't just stop going to the gym.
[1436.15s -> 1441.67s]  Yeah. I also used to be like 170 pounds of pure muscle, a stack of absolute shit and I was
[1441.67s -> 1449.51s]  unstoppable. I now like see my stomach when I take a piss now. That's just a fact. What? I,
[1449.51s -> 1470.92s]  just because I worked out before, I couldn't do it right now if I wanted to. I love these.
[1470.92s -> 1479.42s]  I love the warlock. All right. Let's heal. Welcome to episode one of Germacraft.
[1479.42s -> 1491.42s]  How did you speed that up? That didn't need to be sped up. No, don't.
[1504.82s -> 1510.34s]  Don't kill me. Come on. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Me playing. You should give me extra lives.
[1511.22s -> 1516.20s]  Holy shit. I'm going to die. You want to get baked, Dave? Is that what you want?
[1518.42s -> 1533.51s]  All right. They're, they're all shooting at the same time. God damn it. All right. That's what
[1533.51s -> 1547.51s]  you got to do. Oh shit. Too many. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't shoot me. Oh,
[1547.51s -> 1554.66s]  fuck. All right. This is hard. This is hard. All right. This is a hard game. Let's go.
[1555.30s -> 1568.76s]  I'll get it this time. I promise you died to the warlocks omega low. No, this is not an easy game.
[1569.48s -> 1593.03s]  Here we are. Don't ever melee the warlocks. You attacked who? What? You attacked my friend who?
[1597.64s -> 1613.13s]  You attacked my friend. Oh, Malfoy. Okay. God damn it. That's not plus two. Everybody hates that.
[1613.85s -> 1614.81s]  Everybody hates that.
[1636.87s -> 1647.40s]  Damn it. See, look at everybody's free. Everyone's saying minus two. See, I told you.
[1648.28s -> 1670.65s]  Oh, I'm so bad. There it is. All right. This is where I was last time. I don't want to get
[1670.65s -> 1684.57s]  messed up again. Don't die here. This is probably going to get so hard. I'm already having trouble
[1684.57s -> 1697.78s]  in this room. Damn it. They said don't attack melee. I couldn't help it. I'm trying to aim
[1697.78s -> 1717.42s]  down. Come on. Who's left? This game is really well made. Yeah, it is. I took one look at this
[1717.42s -> 1722.30s]  on the screenshots and I was just... This is elaborate. This is very elaborate.
[1722.30s -> 1734.10s]  Fuck. Don't die to the warlock here. Don't be an idiot. There it is. All right. Let's go.
[1747.11s -> 1762.25s]  What's up here? Uh-oh. This looks dangerous. Damn it. Dude, that's not me laughing. There's
[1762.25s -> 1780.55s]  no way that's me. Anything else this way? No. It's supposed to be us. All right. All right.
[1780.55s -> 1802.95s]  These are the audience. All right. What's in the top? This is so high. This is expelliarmus for
[1802.95s -> 1844.90s]  every spell. Oh, shit. This is another way to go. What? I think it's random. Nice. I can't believe
[1844.90s -> 1859.69s]  it. I can't believe we just shot Otto. All right. So, we got Otto, Giant Rat. How dare they minus
[1859.69s -> 1879.46s]  two? I think it's random. I think randomly you get a bad one. Very quiet now. I think this is a
[1879.46s -> 1903.98s]  boss. Is there a checkpoint? Checkpoint? Is it like a currency thing? Casino? Well, I have to go in
[1903.98s -> 1924.46s]  here. I would not be mad if I didn't. What is this? Times 10? Times 2. 3x, 4x, 5x. All right.
[1924.54s -> 1934.71s]  But what am I betting? Inserted funnies. Oh, okay. Let's do 64 funnies. Let's go.
[1942.94s -> 1946.46s]  That's triple watermelons. That's triple watermelons. I just got what I was good.
[1947.50s -> 1954.68s]  Holy shit. It's 2x. All right. You can't. It has to be a max bet. Otherwise, I'm going to lose
[1954.68s -> 1965.46s]  everything. Seven. Give me another one. Nice. Oh, that's good. All right. Now I'm at 500.
[1968.79s -> 1971.91s]  I'm going to do a low bet because I feel like I'm going to run out.
[1978.97s -> 1995.10s]  Shit. Oh, that was a 3x. What the fuck? All right. I'm on a hot streak. Let's go. Oh, yeah.
[1995.10s -> 2000.82s]  Let's go. I don't think I can lose. I think it's rigged. This shit is rigged. I can't lose.
[2008.26s -> 2018.22s]  Bar? That's another bar. All right. I lost that one. That's a good. All right. Look, I made money.
[2018.78s -> 2039.08s]  It's a diamond. Three diamonds. Let's see it. Goodbye. I win. I'm done. That's 5x. All right.
[2039.08s -> 2047.80s]  One more. A thousand. Then we're done. That's it. I'm done after this. Give me the seven.
[2048.36s -> 2057.38s]  I'll take fruit. I'll take fruit. All right. I'm out of here. I'm out. I made over a thousand funnies.
[2057.38s -> 2073.82s]  I'm good. I'm done. Let's go. Yeah. I came in here with like 300. I'm leaving with 1500.
[2073.82s -> 2078.25s]  Oh, is that not a win? It doesn't matter what you went up. It doesn't matter if you don't go down.
[2091.22s -> 2099.51s]  Uh-oh. The giant enemy dinosaur.
[2107.37s -> 2120.94s]  What do I do? Select? Oh, shit. All right. Can I go down? It's not like Bowser, right?
[2140.41s -> 2151.54s]  Shields down. Wait, it's just. Oh, fuck. There's like multiple phases. Oh, man. This is not as
[2151.54s -> 2154.74s]  just self-expl... Oh, my God. All right. Hold on. I can stop talking.
[2165.86s -> 2191.14s]  Come on. All right. Out, out, out, out, out, out. The ads. Watch out. Does that hit them too? It does.
[2191.14s -> 2216.63s]  Okay. Good. Juggle. Just keep them juggled. Oh, this is bad. Okay. I got to hide.
[2222.82s -> 2231.37s]  Hold them one at a time. If I get hit like three or four times, I'm going to die.
[2234.49s -> 2252.82s]  Hmm. Shit. All right. We're fine. One more and we're good. That is it. Boss dead. Nice.
[2253.94s -> 2285.19s]  Does it explode? This is just what a regular stream is. I'm kind of realizing. Like it's press
[2285.19s -> 2292.87s]  X to fill dead air with various noises. I should have really said anything in like a few minutes.
[2295.99s -> 2309.88s]  It's just ways to keep you engaged. Wait, don't break them all. It's probably a secret somewhere,
[2309.88s -> 2330.28s]  right? Why would they put all these here? Yeah, I knew it. What's up here? I'm the rat. You need
[2330.28s -> 2348.41s]  to jingle the keys. We're children. That's fine. Reward. What's wrong with my guy? Truth. Truth.
[2348.41s -> 2371.10s]  What's the truth? You've done very well, young one. You've proven your strength to me. Perhaps
[2371.10s -> 2378.50s]  it's time to reveal my true identity.
[2417.98s -> 2423.58s]  Your grand. You're going down. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey, hey. The secret is this.
[2424.70s -> 2443.96s]  I didn't press anything. Happy birthday. Oh, thanks. Secret about your father and
[2443.96s -> 2447.24s]  grandfather is that they are both here to celebrate along with the birthday of rats.
[2448.22s -> 2477.19s]  Let's go to the party. Jeremy. I'm so sweaty in that middle one. Nice. Very nice. No, it's not.
[2477.43s -> 2495.90s]  The stream is still live. It's not over. The stream is not over. 1586. Final time. 27 minutes.
[2496.54s -> 2504.22s]  Plus you played the slots. It's now that it's the best stream. All that gambling
[2504.22s -> 2516.70s]  paid off. There was a big adventure. A game by Warbler based on German985, the Spiegei.
[2522.71s -> 2541.37s]  Wait, truth ending two. Truth ending one. What does that mean? Complex. Very cool.
[2541.93s -> 2550.78s]  But with Unity, Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and Audition. Oh, if I actually hit them,
[2550.78s -> 2561.34s]  you could kill them for the chips. All right. Can we see the other ending? I want to see the
[2561.34s -> 2574.36s]  other ending. That was so cool. Oh, look out for a wacky behind the scenes video. I wonder if that's
[2574.36s -> 2590.86s]  there. Thanks for playing. I want to see the other ending. Let's go. New game. Can I speed run it?
[2593.74s -> 2602.70s]  Wait, wait a minute. Oh, nice. Okay. I want to start from the post-boss region with no,
[2602.70s -> 2611.40s]  with zero points. What a psycho mode. All right. Well, I want to see the other ending first.
[2612.20s -> 2641.51s]  Okay. The other ending is to hit them and get the chips. Let's see what we get.
[2642.15s -> 2656.28s]  I can skip the cut scene. Okay. Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to see.
[2656.36s -> 2676.55s]  Wait, what? No damage. I didn't mean, I didn't need to. Okay. Hold on. This is very sad ending.
[2676.55s -> 2690.63s]  All right. Hold on. Let me do that again. That was the ending. Was that? No, it wasn't.
[2690.63s -> 2697.37s]  Let's go. Okay. New game. From that checkpoint. I'm going to hit them.
[2697.37s -> 2709.00s]  Start with, we'll start with $300. Okay. Go. There's more to it. I swear. Okay.
[2709.56s -> 2736.55s]  I was from the dev's mouth. Okay. I'm ready. We're going to kill the grandfather and go get chips.
[2737.11s -> 2769.66s]  You've done well. Okay. We can fill the dead air. You dog. I jingled the keys. Yes.
[2773.77s -> 2774.25s]  Let's kill him.
[2780.82s -> 2781.70s]  TV rovo.
[2796.78s -> 2801.98s]  You want to know about your father. I kind of want the chips.
[2828.47s -> 2839.93s]  Wait, this, this is a different outro. 300 funnies. Okay. Final time plus checks.
[2841.37s -> 2851.59s]  Average stream. That's fine. That's all right. That's fine. I don't have to be best dream.
[2852.15s -> 2868.10s]  Try psycho mode. Yeah. I'm definitely going to try psycho mode. All right. I'm going to do psycho
[2868.10s -> 2879.40s]  mode. Should I just start from the beginning? Let's go. New game. Okay. Psycho mode. New
[2879.40s -> 2891.24s]  conquest. So what's the difference? Welcome to episode one of German psycho adventure.
[2895.45s -> 2911.62s]  Screaming. I already have the bat. Okay. I've got a raid come in too from a J six.
[2911.62s -> 2920.50s]  Still was. Thanks a lot. Welcome everybody. I'll sing the rain. So the rate song. Sure.
[2923.10s -> 2929.88s]  Thanks for coming. Playing a couple of games that some of the community members have made.
[2929.88s -> 2937.32s]  And this is not, we're in psycho mode. I have glasses on. Is this a whole new game?
[2938.98s -> 2948.17s]  What's the difference? Oh shit. This is a different game. That other one was just
[2948.17s -> 2964.44s]  practice for this. Oh my God. Freddy dread is give 50 community subs. Freddy, what do you
[2964.44s -> 2970.09s]  have to write? Are you giving 50 subs? Wait, Freddy, give it all these subs.
[2971.05s -> 2975.13s]  Why he give it all these subs, right? That's a shit load. Welcome everybody.
[2975.13s -> 2978.81s]  What do you mean welcome? Like you've given a sub. You weren't here before.
[2978.81s -> 2984.30s]  I combined the raid and the sub. Well, some of you that just rated might not have,
[2984.30s -> 2990.14s]  maybe you have one. Maybe you got one of the drops. The giant enemy spy.
[2990.14s -> 2995.35s]  Thanks a lot. Freddy's here. That's a lot of money already. He's coming in hot.
[2995.91s -> 3000.47s]  Hope you're doing well, Fred. And I just called you Fred. Are we on those terms yet? And I call
[3000.47s -> 3022.47s]  you Fred. Loose. I just jumped in. You just made it awkward. No, I didn't. I've hung out with
[3022.47s -> 3040.76s]  Freddy Fred in real life. Okay. It's not awkward. We know each other. Oh my God. Now he's just
[3040.76s -> 3053.93s]  flexing. You don't know Freddy like I do. We're the rats. We're the rats. We pray at night.
[3053.93s -> 3062.46s]  We stalk at night. We're the rats. I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[3062.46s -> 3066.46s]  Let's see what kind of trouble we can get our Sims into.
[3066.46s -> 3080.34s]  So what do they do? Oh, I haven't spotted. Nice. I'm just like a psycho on the loose.
[3084.71s -> 3089.85s]  Now I'm really curious as to how this ends. We were on baby mode before.
[3089.85s -> 3101.45s]  Now we're in the real game. That was just a tutorial. Oh, this makes me want to install
[3101.45s -> 3105.80s]  Hollow Knight. Tell everybody I'm going to play it and then fucking play it for an hour
[3105.80s -> 3109.88s]  and then never play it again. I just want to play that now, but only for like an hour
[3109.88s -> 3132.06s]  and then never play it again. I think I got the hang of this. This actually looks fun. This is fun.
[3145.43s -> 3151.18s]  I wish he would do the doi doi doi again. All right. Just for you. I'll do it again.
[3151.18s -> 3157.66s]  I'm going to do a big one. Is he going to rival any of the doi doi dois I've ever done on this
[3157.66s -> 3166.44s]  channel? He's laughing at his own joke. I'm laughing at what the guy said on camera on
[3166.44s -> 3169.96s]  the screen. That was funny. It wasn't even me. That's a different, that's a character that I
[3169.96s -> 3185.24s]  played. It's not me. That was for that one person. Oh, fuck. Watch out. Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[3196.02s -> 3206.89s]  I do laugh at my own jokes. Yeah. I think, I think I'm the funniest damn person.
[3207.53s -> 3215.86s]  I actually kind of don't. I laugh at other people's interpretations of the things that I say.
[3215.86s -> 3222.42s]  That's what makes me laugh more than anything, I think. And people making stuff like this.
[3223.22s -> 3234.58s]  Holy shit. He's big. I can't wait till I, well, not to, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, not, I can't wait.
[3235.30s -> 3240.50s]  Let's rephrase that. I was going to say, I'm looking forward to eventually when I'm done
[3240.50s -> 3244.26s]  streaming. I'm not looking forward to that. Like, let's hold on. I got to, how do I phrase this?
[3245.50s -> 3250.86s]  When I eventually am not streaming anymore and I'm one of those people that does like a comedy
[3250.86s -> 3266.42s]  course at college, I can't wait to do a comedy course. Teach like once a week. Humor, humorist.
[3266.42s -> 3277.43s]  German985 teaches kids at the local, I don't know, like local state school. I'm definitely not good
[3277.43s -> 3282.60s]  enough for anything besides just like a, like a two year school. Nobody wants to bring me in
[3282.60s -> 3297.24s]  for like a, like a four year school. Nope, it won't happen. I'm not prestigious enough
[3297.24s -> 3302.28s]  for their, for their big, big, wonderful, like four or five year master's program.
[3303.50s -> 3309.06s]  Fuck you out of here. You don't need that. You come to my, you come to my class and you'll learn.
[3309.94s -> 3321.11s]  Comedy instructor. Yep. And the first day of class, I'm going to come in in a costume
[3321.75s -> 3326.66s]  and I'm not going to introduce myself. I'm going to make like noises and like get on the table
[3326.90s -> 3331.30s]  on top of the, like where the desk is and be like making elephant sounds and shit and like
[3331.30s -> 3334.82s]  lying on my back and like scratching my ears like a dog and stuff. And then I'm going to get up.
[3334.82s -> 3339.78s]  I'm going to take all the costumes off and I'm going to say, those of you that didn't take notes
[3339.78s -> 3354.98s]  on what just happened, get up and leave the class. Serious people only. We'll have you pick something
[3354.98s -> 3367.30s]  else. You're just getting fired. Like I wouldn't even show up to class half the time. I would just
[3367.30s -> 3373.54s]  forget. It's like 30 students just sitting there waiting in the like lecture hall. I'm just not
[3373.54s -> 3381.77s]  there. Can I say the same shit that I say to you guys? Oh yeah. I auto had to go out. So I'm not
[3381.77s -> 3392.55s]  streaming today. What? Yeah. I had to take my dog out. Sorry. It's been six hours. Um, okay.
[3396.30s -> 3407.99s]  So you've lied. No, I've never lied. Actually, I had a tweet lined up. Uh, it was, it's in my
[3407.99s -> 3412.39s]  drafts right now. Uh, let me read it to you. Let me read you precisely the tweet.
[3414.34s -> 3417.86s]  Tweet says, and I didn't send it cause I was like, no, I, I want to stream today
[3418.50s -> 3426.42s]  because I did, this did happen. So the tweet says this, I wrote this, um, last night.
[3429.05s -> 3435.77s]  Hey guys, no stream tomorrow. I hurt my balls yesterday. I accidentally smushed them.
[3435.77s -> 3441.96s]  I'll let you know when I'm coming back. I was just wasn't going to stream today,
[3443.29s -> 3448.33s]  but I did smush my balls though. That's not a lie, but I was like, no, I'll be okay. I can,
[3448.33s -> 3457.10s]  I can do it. But yeah, I was going to cancel the stream today because I smushed my balls
[3458.06s -> 3465.74s]  and I was like, is it worth it? Canceling the stream for people to see that. Maybe they'll be
[3465.74s -> 3470.76s]  worth it. Maybe you think it was funny. I don't know. I was like, no, I want to, I want to stream
[3470.76s -> 3482.36s]  even if it's for a little while. We didn't now, but I'm live right now. No stream tomorrow.
[3483.32s -> 3503.06s]  Oh, I got to pay attention. We didn't now. You plan on streaming tomorrow? No, but that was
[3503.06s -> 3509.46s]  because I was planning on not streaming today. But then I had this other epiphany in my brain
[3509.46s -> 3514.82s]  and look, listen to me. So those of you that have been following this channel for a long time,
[3515.38s -> 3520.57s]  been here for a while, years, a lot of you, which first of all, that's crazy. I'm like
[3520.57s -> 3522.89s]  surprised every day that people still watch this and still think that
[3525.21s -> 3531.61s]  stuff like that is still funny to you. But if you've been watching and noticing the sus
[3532.17s -> 3538.17s]  over the last three or four years, anytime I ever plan to do, oh, hey, I'll be, I'll be live like
[3538.17s -> 3543.21s]  Monday or Tuesday. Yeah, I'll be live on maybe like, I don't know, Saturday, Sunday. If there's
[3543.21s -> 3548.09s]  within three or four days of time ahead of that stream, it's guaranteed to be the next day.
[3548.81s -> 3556.76s]  If you see me right Monday or Tuesday, the stream is on Wednesday every time. So even though I
[3556.76s -> 3562.36s]  smushed my balls, I was like, no, I can't, no, I'm not going, I'm not delaying to Wednesday.
[3562.36s -> 3568.31s]  Nope. I don't care how smushed they are and make no mistake. They're painful. It's painful,
[3569.03s -> 3592.57s]  but I was not going to do that again. Oh, I don't know. Then it just had happened. Okay. I'm not
[3592.57s -> 3603.11s]  going to give you specifics of how it just did. Sometimes you sit down too fast or too weirdly.
[3603.11s -> 3607.90s]  Oh, you turn a weird way where you're sleeping or sometimes you, you fall.
[3619.72s -> 3628.07s]  I'm laughing at somebody said he paid somebody to do it. Sorry guys. I can't stream tomorrow.
[3628.63s -> 3638.68s]  I had somebody come over and smush my balls. That makes that tweet. No, no, no, no. Okay. All right.
[3639.32s -> 3643.58s]  We've got to move on from this, but just know, just know the stream was almost canceled today.
[3648.47s -> 3652.95s]  People are writing like, huh? Just relax. It's fine. Everything's going to be fine.
[3653.75s -> 3669.21s]  Was it left or right? It's both. How is not the question. The question is it did is the question
[3669.21s -> 3676.25s]  is, is right? No, no, no. It's not the, it's not the how it's the why it's not the why either. It's
[3676.25s -> 3685.29s]  the, it's the who, what, when it's the, when it was last night or tonight, whatever, whatever it
[3685.29s -> 3697.86s]  was. I don't remember. It's the, it happened. It's is it did. It's not, I'm not tiny. I'm compact.
[3699.54s -> 3706.50s]  The only information you have to have is there was a, I got smushed somehow and that's it.
[3712.76s -> 3715.56s]  You just dug yourself a grave. It did. You never cease to impress that.
[3716.12s -> 3724.23s]  I mean, how you, it's all fine. It's not, there's no who it's, it's not a who it's, it is. All right.
[3724.23s -> 3729.37s]  Get out of here. Man, everybody that says smush time out. Everybody that says the word smush.
[3729.37s -> 3750.82s]  And then that's it. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to kill them.
[3752.17s -> 3753.85s]  Oh, thank, thankfully they planned for that.
[3754.49s -> 3782.98s]  Hit it. This is the, this is the lesson here. This wait, this is no, no, no. This whole thing
[3782.98s -> 3789.18s]  did not turn into a routine where I'm still the professor at the college. This actually happened
[3791.34s -> 3794.06s]  somebody thinks that I'm talking about like being the professor still.
[3794.86s -> 3813.14s]  This is not like the lesson plan. I gotta hit it up. Damn it. There we go. How many more are there?
[3813.78s -> 3837.64s]  Episode. I was taking notes. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. No, we're good. Shit. Is it one more?
[3838.36s -> 3844.58s]  All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Shit. Oh my God.
[3844.58s -> 3856.92s]  He's aiming down. Oh my goodness. Okay. I gotta get up top first. Let's be on the test. There are
[3856.92s -> 3866.62s]  no tests in my classroom. Everybody has to do a performance. There are no tests. You have a five
[3866.62s -> 3872.33s]  minute piece or 10 minute piece you have to do at the end of the year. And then I am the sole judge
[3872.33s -> 3896.02s]  if it was funny enough for you to pass the class. Is it? Shit. You're a cool professor.
[3896.82s -> 3900.50s]  That's what I'm going for, man. I want like a cool, I want to have that cool professor vibe.
[3901.94s -> 3921.18s]  Shit. All right. I have to pay attention. I'm not paying attention. Okay. Now right here. Fuck. Oh
[3921.18s -> 3927.14s]  my God. All right. I don't get an A. My mom is going to send me to the glue factory.
[3928.46s -> 3935.38s]  I feel like we mean to go to work. What do you mean? You're going to go to the glue factory?
[3939.85s -> 3943.94s]  Oh, okay. Okay. We're going to, I'm going to go to the fact. Oh, okay.
[3956.12s -> 3974.60s]  Shit. I suck. I suck at this. I gotta move. Just move. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3978.41s -> 4003.50s]  No, you fuck. Holy shit. Okay. I need to, I got to heal. Holy God. Did I get it?
[4003.50s -> 4023.85s]  Is it one more? Shit. Come on. I need to heal. I think is it more? Oh my God. Jesus. Oh, I got it.
[4023.85s -> 4042.74s]  I got it. I got it. This is the weirdest class I've ever been to keep distance from warlocks.
[4043.38s -> 4057.75s]  I can kill them if I do one hit. Nice.
[4062.78s -> 4070.92s]  When's the parent teacher conference? You don't have those as a college professor.
[4072.89s -> 4076.01s]  I just show up and I do my lesson plan and then I just leave.
[4087.34s -> 4097.13s]  This is a full heel. Oh, I'm going to need it now. Oh my God. What are you a professor in comedy?
[4097.69s -> 4111.35s]  These teachers suck. He's playing video games, all class and you eat in class. Yes. As long
[4111.35s -> 4116.14s]  as it's not crunchy. You can eat whatever you want. As long as you're not going to make any
[4116.14s -> 4125.98s]  crunch mouth sounds. And if it's chewy, chew with your mouth closed. I don't want to hear the like,
[4127.58s -> 4131.74s]  the chewy shit. Crunchy is loud. Chewy can be loud if you open your mouth.
[4132.46s -> 4155.88s]  Slurping is fine. No, if you can eat quietly, you can have it. Nothing crunchy and no loud bags
[4155.88s -> 4164.92s]  either. I don't want to hear that. It'll distract me. No, don't bring like Lays potato chip bags
[4164.92s -> 4175.90s]  and you're going to crinkle up. No, don't do that. You're going to bring the smelliest food
[4175.90s -> 4185.42s]  imaginable. No, you can't have that either. It can't be crunchy. It can't be chewy. It can't smell
[4186.30s -> 4194.49s]  and it can't be hot because that's a hazard. You can't have like a bowl of spaghetti in the
[4194.49s -> 4204.26s]  room because what if you drop it on somebody? It burns them or something. That'll make a mess. Yeah,
[4204.26s -> 4215.66s]  no. Pop tarts. Pop tarts are absolutely perfect. Yogurt. That's really good. That'd be okay.
[4222.10s -> 4226.65s]  Pop tarts, crinkle. No, not if you're quiet. If you tear it right at the top and you make
[4226.65s -> 4237.42s]  it really silent, it doesn't make a loud noise. It's very light foil. There's three more of these
[4237.42s -> 4246.09s]  guys. Where are they? Coffee, Cheetos, chicken. What if it's for comedy? It better be really funny.
[4247.05s -> 4258.73s]  If you're doing a look at I have a loud potato chip bag routine, it better be really funny. I
[4258.73s -> 4267.14s]  fart in my chip bag. That might be funny. Where do you do this? Do you do it like you just come
[4267.14s -> 4270.18s]  up and say, excuse me, I need to interrupt the class and then fart into your bake lays?
[4271.14s -> 4282.84s]  Okay. Yeah, that's funny. See? I mean, I would tell you to sit down. I'd be like, all right,
[4282.84s -> 4299.45s]  now sit down. You little shit. Can you order a pizza to the class? No, unless it was, but here's
[4299.45s -> 4305.74s]  how you would do that. You would be absent. And so one of your peers that's also in the comedy
[4305.74s -> 4310.14s]  class would be like, I'm going to order a pizza. You would order the pizza. I would have marked you
[4310.14s -> 4317.00s]  absent. You would show up 20 minutes later in a pizza guy outfit, delivering the pizza to the
[4317.00s -> 4334.20s]  class. I would give you a, I would give you a stamp on that one. It has to be pepperoni with
[4334.20s -> 4338.15s]  cheese. Well, then you would know that's my favorite pizza. So you get, you know, points with the
[4338.15s -> 4347.34s]  teacher. And then if you got into the class and you had the bag of lays and right. And when you
[4347.34s -> 4353.42s]  got in, okay. So you, that the pizza delivery is called, you show up, you say, Oh, somebody
[4353.42s -> 4357.74s]  ordered pizza. And it's like, Oh, there he is. This is the absolute, this is the absent guy.
[4357.74s -> 4361.26s]  And you immediately grab a full bag of bake lays and you just fart directly into it.
[4361.98s -> 4366.78s]  I think that would probably give you an egg that combines both things you're talking about.
[4382.63s -> 4390.12s]  Now that person passed, they don't have to come to class anymore. That person doesn't need to
[4390.12s -> 4402.06s]  come to class. I'm just going to give you an egg. But if you come to class in a fursuit,
[4404.94s -> 4414.82s]  um, it's probably probably kind of hot in there. And as long as I could verify that it was you,
[4418.42s -> 4426.12s]  I don't know what your routine is. Okay. No, no. Okay. If you had an anthro con badge on
[4427.00s -> 4433.72s]  around your neck and it was you like, you came to the wrong place. If you're like, okay, that's
[4433.72s -> 4444.09s]  funny. You would pass and you could leave. Oh, fuck, watch out. Is it, is it like, is it like
[4444.09s -> 4461.14s]  a currency thing? I mean, he knows I just, cause I know it exists. I told you guys what I wanted
[4461.14s -> 4469.14s]  to do one day. I've never done it. I wanted to dress up in a full fursuit and just go and just
[4469.14s -> 4477.75s]  blend in and not have no one have ever know it was me. I would be in my hotel room is the only
[4477.75s -> 4484.26s]  time I would ever take off that costume. I would not talk. I would not tell anyone. No one would
[4484.26s -> 4491.38s]  ever know. I would just have to make sure that when I got in the hotel room, it was nobody else
[4491.38s -> 4497.80s]  with me. All the, everything's closed. All the blinds are closed. Everything is closed. Nobody
[4497.80s -> 4506.76s]  can, it is impossible. I would, I would leave my cell phone. I would leave my cell phone at home.
[4507.32s -> 4521.10s]  That couldn't get fucking tracked. Nothing. Nothing. Just go. It would be a big elaborate
[4521.10s -> 4533.40s]  costume. There's no way you could ever find out. You know, don't say swears. What would be the
[4533.40s -> 4544.89s]  point of it if nobody found out? You failed. Hand in your syllabus and hand in your fucking comedy
[4544.89s -> 4574.62s]  token. Sorry, you failed the class. Comedy tokens. One star on Rape My Professor.
[4578.22s -> 4585.45s]  No way. I would have five. I would be at least 4.5. You're telling you to, okay, hold on a minute.
[4586.09s -> 4590.25s]  You're saying that if you had a class that you just had to impress the professor for like a
[4590.25s -> 4595.45s]  minute and you got an A and you didn't have to go anymore and this guy lets you eat food in class
[4597.16s -> 4600.92s]  and all he cares about is you doing a little comedy routine and then he passes you.
[4601.64s -> 4608.90s]  You don't have to go anymore. Are you serious? I feel like that you would be full of five star
[4608.90s -> 4632.28s]  reviews. What an ego. How much is the class? Good question. How much would the class be?
[4636.42s -> 4643.90s]  I feel like it definitely wouldn't be free, but it wouldn't be expensive.
[4644.62s -> 4657.64s]  It would be like the cost of going to see Cirque du Soleil in the back row.
[4662.14s -> 4670.31s]  Maybe 40 bucks? 30 bucks? How much does Cirque du Soleil take you? Is it expensive? I thought
[4670.31s -> 4678.90s]  it was like 40 bucks to go see Cirque du Soleil. 32 bucks? Is it more than 100? Oh my god, I have
[4678.90s -> 4694.98s]  to heal. I just got headshot. Fuck. Okay, I wasn't paying attention. Fuck. All right, let me just
[4694.98s -> 4709.34s]  beat this first and we'll talk more about this stuff. You're worth Cirque du Soleil money? I mean
[4709.34s -> 4716.87s]  it's how much is it for like a class in college right now? It's just way too fucking expensive.
[4717.67s -> 4740.81s]  Depends. How much is a front row seat at Cirque du Soleil? I wonder. Maybe it's probably like
[4740.81s -> 4755.96s]  four or five hundred bucks for like a front row seat. 500? Fuck. All right, about 350.
[4756.60s -> 4776.44s]  Usually around 1 to 2k. Holy shit, really? Oh my god, I'm getting juggled. Stay back here and heal.
[4778.14s -> 4780.86s]  All right, let's go. The giant enemy spider.
[4785.91s -> 4789.70s]  Why would wearing a fur suit be hot? Do you think furries are hot? Are you a furry now? What is,
[4789.70s -> 4795.14s]  why is, what? Is it my turn? Like, I'm talking temperature wise. It'd probably be pretty
[4795.14s -> 4809.86s]  toasty in there. Oh, Darkest Dungeon 2 comes out, right? In like four or five days?
[4809.86s -> 4827.50s]  When does that come out? I want to play that. Changing the topic. Yes, it's a topic I care
[4827.50s -> 4844.73s]  very deeply about. This shit is bouncing. That's what's going on. Oh my god, Jeremy, come on.
[4845.21s -> 4854.25s]  All right. Well, it's not a change of subject. We were done with that other subject and I moved
[4854.25s -> 4862.04s]  on to a new one. I didn't change the subject. I went to another topic because we were done with
[4862.04s -> 4879.29s]  the first one. Oh my god, you got greedy. We were not done? What do you mean? You want to go back
[4879.29s -> 4901.66s]  and talk about my smushed balls? I don't. Shit. Oh my god. Watch out. That was actually kind of scary.
[4904.73s -> 4926.25s]  Oh god. Oh, get back up here. Way too many. Get rid of the big one. All right. Now I can go down.
[4928.74s -> 4940.49s]  Oh, shit. He got hit by that on the way back. I think that's it down here.
[4941.85s -> 4963.38s]  Is this game canon? It's in the German Extended Universe. Whoa.
[4974.79s -> 4991.78s]  All right. Only one more. One more magician. All right. That's it. Welcome to episode one of
[4991.78s -> 5002.94s]  Germacraft. Are there any non-canon streams? Oh, the smite ones. Is this a secret? Did I miss it?
[5004.09s -> 5013.30s]  No, we've already seen it. This is just Psycho mode. I already got to the top of this before,
[5013.30s -> 5019.14s]  right? Did I do it again? I mean, might as well. Did I miss something?
[5035.66s -> 5047.70s]  Chad, Germa isn't canon. Yeah, I mean, yeah, he is. I said smite. Well, smite streams are not canon.
[5047.70s -> 5059.91s]  I think a canon stream is the ones that, you know, the big projects probably. Those are all
[5059.91s -> 5071.53s]  canon. We got 20 community subs? Affmeric, thanks for the 20 community subs. Appreciate it. Thank
[5071.53s -> 5081.61s]  you. Thanks for 20 subs. Two zero. Are you going to put an edible in the Germa rumble? Oh no,
[5081.61s -> 5088.28s]  that's not what you said. I don't know why I read that like that. As a character?
[5093.85s -> 5097.45s]  Oh, damn it.
[5106.55s -> 5113.34s]  There we go. Is there anything up here? What about the JCU, the cinematic universe? Yeah,
[5114.30s -> 5130.46s]  sure. Hey, Neer, thanks for the eight. You know how we say it here. Say it with me.
[5131.61s -> 5136.44s]  Community subs. Everybody says it and we all like laugh. It's all thing we do.
[5137.00s -> 5164.65s]  I'll give immunity. It's Otto. I love Otto. All right, we're getting to the end of the
[5164.65s -> 5181.56s]  Psycho blog. I think I've done pretty well. All right. Watch it. What the fuck are you doing?
[5181.56s -> 5208.98s]  What is he doing? He killed Otto in Resident Evil 8. What are you talking about? Stop being greedy
[5208.98s -> 5224.95s]  and get him. You idiot. The guy in the big barn. There's a secret boss. Big barn. Oh, I have to go
[5224.95s -> 5248.58s]  back to the casino. Whoa. Oh my God. I'm not going to die in here. Am I? What the fuck? No,
[5248.58s -> 5256.65s]  I can't do this. Fuck, I didn't finish the joke and now I'm going to die.
[5265.00s -> 5274.18s]  Fuck. Oh my God. I can't. What the hell, man? I can't. No. How far back is the checkpoint?
[5274.18s -> 5280.71s]  Oh, thank God. No, wait, is this all the way back to the other room?
[5285.43s -> 5289.59s]  It's not. Thank goodness. All right. Well, I can't gamble. I'm not going to get killed.
[5300.95s -> 5331.27s]  Casino. All right. Fine. No, I can't. What is it? Lemon. Lemon. Lemon. Oh, fuck. Never mind.
[5331.27s -> 5367.67s]  We're going right by it. Okay. Get away from me. I don't know how the final boss changes.
[5368.31s -> 5375.29s]  No. All right. The giant dinosaur. Holy shit. This is going to be so hard. I'm going to stay
[5375.29s -> 5424.07s]  down here. Yeah. Fuck it. I'm staying here. I just cheese this encounter. What? Run, run,
[5424.07s -> 5456.10s]  run, run, run, run, run, run, run. I bring them over here. I get them over here. All right. One
[5456.10s -> 5460.50s]  more time. And then that's it. And then I get the true, true ending, but there'll probably be two
[5460.50s -> 5478.02s]  different endings, right? Oh, flying. What the fuck was that? Oh shit. Oh my God. Just hide down
[5478.02s -> 5487.77s]  here. Is it like, is it like a currency thing? I didn't get it. All right. I'll get it. Shit.
[5488.57s -> 5515.98s]  This is bad. This is really bad. This is really bad. Where are the dinosaurs gone? Where are they?
[5516.94s -> 5542.23s]  Did they fall down? All right. I win. This doesn't seem like I can't move. Can they shoot me? All
[5542.23s -> 5551.86s]  right. Oh, I just got feeding frenzy too, to run on my laptop. Holy shit. That's a celebration
[5551.86s -> 5578.78s]  moment. This is not smite. No, it's fine. It's fun. All right. I can still get the, uh, hold on,
[5578.78s -> 5582.39s]  break this, but don't kill everybody. They kill these people, but don't break the boxes.
[5592.62s -> 5611.10s]  Shit. Hold on. God damn it. Get out of the way. Is this the guy that beat Spampton,
[5611.98s -> 5631.86s]  Jevil, and Jerma Dinosaur first try? It is. I'm just going. All right. Here we go. I'm going to,
[5631.86s -> 5637.85s]  I'm not going to kill them. Let's see if we get the true ending and then we'll do the other ending
[5637.85s -> 5644.07s]  too. Just to make sure we cover all the bases. I didn't press anything.
[5653.75s -> 5658.58s]  After his brutal conquest, Jerma obtained the prize chips for real this time.
[5666.41s -> 5692.57s]  Oh, I get it. Okay. Seven 92. Very cool. I think that's it.
[5693.37s -> 5708.89s]  There's another one lined up here to play. That's right. Kevin McLeod
[5709.61s -> 5716.20s]  is the master of royalty-free music. Tried to get nine eight five for the secret ending.
[5717.16s -> 5725.88s]  That accurate? What happens to be getting nine eight five honeys? Can we confirm with the dev
[5725.88s -> 5749.45s]  that's real? Is it real? You can't cause they're in multiples of two. You can't get an odd number.
[5758.73s -> 5768.25s]  All right. Well, that was cool. That was from War, War Bill War Brill. Where are you? War Blur,
[5768.25s -> 5782.46s]  War Blur War Blur stats, brother lowest score. I score locked it fast. I unlocked all these.
[5783.26s -> 5789.48s]  Oh, I see. It's different modes. That was really cool. I'm going to play the next one.
[5790.04s -> 5793.00s]  Next one. I believe the one next one's a point and click adventure game.
[5793.64s -> 5800.68s]  Okay. Thank you. That was really, really awesome. I think it's called Otto's
[5800.68s -> 5808.97s]  great adventure or something. Let's do it. Uh, we're also, we'll take a break. I'll go BRB,
[5808.97s -> 6004.79s]  go pee, come back, play that one. I'll be right back. I forgot to say I was back. Sorry about
[6004.79s -> 6022.01s]  that. Derma and Otto, the curse of the late streamer. Music can stay here. Sound effects.
[6022.65s -> 6031.11s]  That sounds pretty good. Turn it up a little bit. All right. So this is apparently a point
[6031.11s -> 6039.91s]  and click adventure game. You do a new game. It's right somewhere in the Nevada desert
[6040.47s -> 6049.88s]  around 12 to 1 PM Pacific. You have an event. I'm going for the middle class.
[6050.44s -> 6076.26s]  That's how it feels. Sometimes. Yeah. This is actually how it is. I'm not even kidding.
[6079.03s -> 6084.65s]  I'm late for the stream. Chat's going to kill me. That's how it feels. If I know that it's
[6084.65s -> 6089.61s]  going to take me like 30 minutes to get ready and just like, fuck, they're just probably so
[6090.81s -> 6096.17s]  trying. They go as fast as I can. I better get over to my computer room as soon as possible.
[6096.73s -> 6109.70s]  Okay. So I have a toy. Look at rug. Okay. Use rug. Oh shit. There's a key under here. Give me
[6109.70s -> 6124.68s]  that key. I wonder what this opens. Looks kind of dorky. Looks kind of dorky. Get it? Oh shit.
[6124.68s -> 6129.08s]  I didn't until right now. Door key. Okay. Come on. Adventure games have to have bad puns.
[6129.64s -> 6140.55s]  Is it in my stomach? This is crazy. Okay. Bad. This is where the magic happens. I'm going to
[6140.55s -> 6153.05s]  give you a fully voice acted game by the way. You understand? Mirror. Whoa. Who's that handsome
[6153.05s -> 6159.96s]  hunk staring back at me? You can do this today. You're going to go out there and you're going to
[6159.96s -> 6164.76s]  show everyone what you're made of. You're going to show everybody what you're capable of. Not what
[6164.76s -> 6173.86s]  anyone else is what you are. You have what it takes. This is a map of the cartoon town I live in.
[6176.92s -> 6190.76s]  Toy blocks. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. What? Use toy blocks. I think they can stay where they
[6190.76s -> 6211.30s]  are. This is my prize possession. Made with real diamonds. Blue raspberry flavored. It's what?
[6211.30s -> 6219.13s]  Wait. Eleven? I don't know. I don't think changing the clock is going to make me any less late.
[6219.13s -> 6231.14s]  Anything else I can do in here? I got a key. I have a diamond pickaxe. Let's go. Headroom door.
[6231.14s -> 6239.42s]  Outside door. Can I look outside? Reddit room door. Okay. Well, who's on the air? Not me.
[6239.42s -> 6248.07s]  There's no time for distractions. I've got a stream to start. It's locked. I must have left
[6248.07s -> 6256.26s]  the key around here somewhere. This does not happen where I live. Because I would hide this
[6256.26s -> 6259.70s]  key and forget about it and forget it and have to put a shoulder into the door to get in here.
[6259.70s -> 6272.86s]  This is... I wouldn't do that. Okay. Here we go. Reddit shit. Holy shit. This is just... This is my
[6272.94s -> 6286.44s]  room. This is crazy. This is actually one to one accurate. What about the... Can I go in the closet?
[6286.44s -> 6294.60s]  Reddit shelf. My Reddit shelf is empty. I must have misplaced all my Funko Puffs.
[6294.60s -> 6299.00s]  I should keep an eye out for them. Sounds like some sort of side mission. That isn't important
[6299.00s -> 6310.18s]  to the main goal. I'm sure that'll be in the DLC. When does Lenarwall bacon? Epic.
[6310.66s -> 6333.70s]  Hahaha. Auto. Cool. Yep. This is also accurate. Dog bed? I wonder where Otto has wandered off to.
[6333.70s -> 6350.02s]  If I move his bed, where's Otto going to sleep? Rotto Beasts. Yep. You must complete all your
[6350.02s -> 6361.11s]  chores before streaming. I forgot to do my chores before stream. Looks like chat might have to wait
[6361.11s -> 6370.06s]  a minute. I'm sure they won't mind. This is... This is completely accurate. Yeah. Find something
[6370.06s -> 6375.02s]  to eat. Sandwich does sound good right about now. All I would need is bread, mayo, and steak yum
[6375.02s -> 6381.02s]  brand meat. That's right. Otto needs to go on a walk. I haven't seen him for a while. I wonder
[6381.02s -> 6387.00s]  where he went. Of course, I definitely can't stream without internet. Let's check the cable
[6387.00s -> 6394.17s]  box outside. See if anything's broken. Okay. So these are the tasks. All right. We're going to
[6394.17s -> 6401.53s]  take Otto for a walk and find something to eat. Cool. All right. Let's go. Wait. What's this?
[6401.53s -> 6410.09s]  Otto's note. Otto's note. One. Hey, everybody. It's me, Otto. I'm off on a big adventure right
[6410.09s -> 6416.02s]  now trying to find who stole the cookies. Are they outside? I should talk to the vroomer.
[6416.02s -> 6423.14s]  He's always outside driving his motorcycle up and down the street. Love, Otto. Who stole the
[6423.14s -> 6431.34s]  cookies? I'm going to find Otto. I've got to find whoever took all the cookies. I should talk to
[6431.34s -> 6444.06s]  the vroomer. Maybe he knows where Otto is. Okay. So I can go this way now. Use wall. I don't know
[6444.06s -> 6461.22s]  what good my hands would do against solid stone. Use wall. Oh God. Look at sign. It says
[6461.22s -> 6473.32s]  VOD watchers skip one hour. Weird. I wonder what that means. Go to door. Go to door on right.
[6473.32s -> 6498.89s]  Go to door up. There's only one choice. Go door down. Go door left. Go door left. Go door up. Go
[6498.89s -> 6522.81s]  door down. Go up. All right. There's a pattern here that I'm missing. Okay. There's two torches
[6522.81s -> 6529.26s]  on this one. Is that like yes and no? Like one torch is no. Two torches is yes or something.
[6529.26s -> 6534.81s]  What the fuck am I talking about? What are you talking about? There's more than one door in each
[6534.81s -> 6567.22s]  room. What? Oh, this room is no. Okay. What? I don't get it. I don't have any items. Okay. Maybe
[6567.22s -> 6598.68s]  if a door has two torches on it, it means it's the real one. With one torch, you just go left. Down
[6598.68s -> 6612.33s]  and left maybe. Torches don't mean anything. I found it. I must have gone the wrong way. I don't
[6612.33s -> 6642.47s]  think I'm supposed to be here. Secret button that kills you. Should I press it? That's a callback,
[6642.47s -> 6658.76s]  isn't it? What happened? I have a feeling that wasn't the right way. I should check the maze
[6658.76s -> 6672.34s]  again. What? Yep. Still a mailbox. Hmm. It's empty. I'll have to check back later. Do I get in the
[6672.34s -> 6680.14s]  road? Dean Dingus lost my vote after he strangled three people. If I put it away now, people will
[6680.14s -> 6687.91s]  call me a centrist Andy. Road. All right. Look at road. I've got to figure out a way to slow down
[6687.91s -> 6695.62s]  the rumor to talk to him. Will he just hit me? I'm just in the road. Well, that was a close one. I
[6695.62s -> 6701.02s]  should find a way of slowing him down. I'm not putting my hand on that. It's probably a thousand
[6701.02s -> 6719.98s]  degrees. Telephone pole? Telephone pole. Looks pretty tall. Can I die up here? What the hell?
[6730.58s -> 6734.42s]  Wow. I did not think it would be this high up. I hope there's no fall joke incoming. Of course
[6734.42s -> 6746.17s]  there is. Looks like another balloon from Boston is coming in. It's a cable box. Screwed shut. This
[6746.17s -> 6750.15s]  is probably where all the internet wires go. Listen, I don't really know how it works. Just
[6750.15s -> 6755.37s]  trust me. I can't open it. It's screwed shut. I've got to find some item that will let me
[6755.37s -> 6772.97s]  unscrew a screw. I need a screwdriver. I love the carnival in the distance.
[6773.37s -> 6787.11s]  I think I used it. I don't have it anymore. So I have to figure that maze out. Let's go back in
[6787.11s -> 6795.77s]  the house. I just want to slow down the rumor. What can I get? This is the Reddit room. What
[6795.77s -> 6808.50s]  about further down here? Okay. Hold on a minute. Let's see, man. Okay. Hallway. It's the clowns in
[6808.50s -> 6820.14s]  the house. Okay. Something about these two looks kind of funny. How do you keep getting into my
[6820.14s -> 6831.26s]  house? Select an action. All right. How about some bread? Ask for bread. Hey, can I have some bread?
[6831.98s -> 6840.42s]  I'll take that as a yes. Oh, nice. All right. Quest complete. Find something to eat, right?
[6841.14s -> 6847.46s]  I need more? How do you two keep getting into my house? All right. What about flirt?
[6848.10s -> 6862.15s]  You want to clown around for a bit? Uh, be rude. I hate your stupid clown guts. Oh, nothing. Can
[6862.15s -> 6873.46s]  I get more food? Flirt? You know what they say about guys with comically large shoes?
[6874.10s -> 6886.09s]  I don't think they like this. Sliding door? Let's go back. Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on. Garbage? Banana
[6886.09s -> 6900.25s]  peel? Banana was not very appealing. I know. I know. Sorry. Oh, sunflowers. Anything else in here?
[6900.25s -> 6911.35s]  What's in there? I've been doing some archaeology recently. Get it. Let's see. Geos. Grotto. Beast
[6911.35s -> 6917.34s]  cars. Buried treasure. Aha. What's this? Looks like some ancient Greek tablet. I wonder how
[6917.34s -> 6933.93s]  that got here. Okay. So this is a code. This is, I got to crack this code. Can I take it? A is A,
[6933.93s -> 6952.81s]  B is B, T is G, triangle is D, E is E, Z is Z, H is E, O is F, I is I, K is K, thick, M is M,
[6952.81s -> 6963.90s]  N is N, E is X, O is O, H is P, P is R, sideways, M is E. Okay. So it's just a, it's the Greek
[6963.90s -> 6971.00s]  alphabet. I feel like I'm going to need, I'm going to need to know. I'm going to need to,
[6971.00s -> 6976.42s]  I can't even say words. I'm trying to say it too fast. Slow down. I feel like I need to know
[6976.42s -> 6984.86s]  that later. Say that's better. What's that last symbol called? Infinity.
[6984.86s -> 7016.87s]  Okay. Use oven. Oh my God. It smells like death in there. What is in there? Is that a pot rose?
[7016.95s -> 7023.43s]  How long has it been in there? Oh, it's oven is ruined. Got to find time to clean it out later.
[7027.51s -> 7032.33s]  Sandwich toaster 9,000. Anything in the fridge? I must've locked it after too many
[7032.33s -> 7045.59s]  midnight snack runs. Putting a padlock on your fridge. Oh my trusty sandwich toaster 3,000.
[7045.59s -> 7052.07s]  It automates the process of assembling the perfect sandwich. All you need is bread, steak yum,
[7052.07s -> 7059.70s]  brand meat product, and tons of mayo. It seems like I'm missing some ingredients for the perfect
[7059.70s -> 7071.48s]  sandwich. Wait, what? I have to regurgitate this into the toaster? I don't think this works with
[7071.48s -> 7084.47s]  that. This is the bread. Still need to find the other ingredients. Okay. So we need steak yum.
[7089.91s -> 7105.96s]  Can I get that? Can't just reach in there? Oh, something bit me. Okay. Keep going. Use door.
[7105.96s -> 7120.01s]  Go to casino. Why is there a casino in my house? It actually did it.
[7120.01s -> 7131.30s]  It's the joke door.
[7149.46s -> 7156.82s]  All right. Let's go to the casino. Oh shit. Blackjack table. Mr. Green.
[7167.24s -> 7172.92s]  Okay. Mr. Green. He's mean. He's green. He runs a casino in my living room. That's about it.
[7177.35s -> 7183.78s]  Well, well, well, if it isn't little Jeremy Albertson. Act for more gambling. Yep. Time to
[7183.78s -> 7190.87s]  make that money. Actually, I'm just trying to get to the living room. I'm just trying to get to the
[7190.87s -> 7196.68s]  living room. Oh, Jeremy, it seems you've already forgotten about that little debt you owe me after
[7196.68s -> 7207.40s]  your last visit. What was it again? 5,000 bits. 5,000 bits? That's correct. You kept double or
[7207.48s -> 7216.47s]  nothing until I had to cut you off. That being said, sorry. In a show of good faith, I'll loan
[7216.47s -> 7222.63s]  you a thousand bits to get you off your feet. Thanks, I guess. Now run along and make me,
[7223.35s -> 7232.62s]  make yourself some money. You sure have a lot of money, Mr. Green. I do. It's all mine and you
[7232.62s -> 7242.98s]  can't have any of it. I have a question. How did you get all this money? How did you get all this
[7242.98s -> 7252.33s]  money? Gambling, of course, and from idiots. I mean, gamers like you, of course. I almost lost
[7252.33s -> 7262.79s]  it all investing in ball coin. Mr. Green, why are you green? Why are flamingos pink? Because they
[7262.79s -> 7283.75s]  eat shrimp. Oh, is that real? All right. So I have a thousand bits. Are you kidding me? Can I save
[7283.75s -> 7300.95s]  the game? All right. Save game. Auto save. All right. New save. Okay. So we have a thousand bits.
[7300.95s -> 7306.50s]  I need to get to 5,000 to pay off Mr. Green. No saves coming. What am I going to replay the whole
[7306.50s -> 7314.86s]  game again? We're going all in. All in. Let's go. 13 versus six. You stay on that. Don't move. He's
[7314.86s -> 7327.96s]  going to bust right here. See you later. That's very bad. I lost everything. Reset? Refund? Refund?
[7330.47s -> 7338.63s]  That's what... That's how you play that hand. Everyone's like, oh my God. Omega. No. If you
[7338.63s -> 7343.21s]  have anything over a 12 versus a deal of showing a six, you don't do anything. That's the highest
[7343.21s -> 7346.87s]  chance to win that hand. You don't do anything. You just don't know how to play blackjack.
[7347.43s -> 7352.47s]  What do you mean nobody stands on 13? You don't know how to play. This is basic blackjack strategy.
[7353.11s -> 7364.62s]  You don't hit on 13 versus six. Are you out of your mind? That's the bust hand. You don't hit on 13.
[7365.50s -> 7377.24s]  What are you talking about? You never win at blackjack. Blackjack's my game. That was a warmup
[7377.24s -> 7386.18s]  round. Mr. Green, have any money? I seem to be out of money. Wait, really? Already? I guess I'm not
[7386.18s -> 7390.74s]  entirely surprised, but all right. What's a thousand more bits to Mr. Green anyway? Try not to lose it
[7390.74s -> 7414.09s]  all again, Goku. Somebody said always hit below 15. That's not... Don't do that. Here we go. Always
[7414.09s -> 7430.79s]  hit below 21. All right. Double aces. I want to split these. I want to split these. I'll get a
[7430.79s -> 7444.76s]  21. All right. We're going to stay at 500. Eight versus... Come on. That sucks. This sucks. I have
[7444.76s -> 7452.92s]  to hit this. I had to. Yeah. 17 versus nine. I'm just going to lose. I always have to assume that
[7452.92s -> 7458.34s]  there's a face card underneath there. You have to assume that there's a face card underneath there.
[7458.90s -> 7467.48s]  Guys, I have way more experience than you do loading up the blackjack app on your phone for
[7467.48s -> 7483.93s]  15 minutes. You understand? That's not how you play blackjack. I'm screwed again. I have to hit
[7483.93s -> 7488.02s]  again. See? That's the way you do it because that's an 18. You see what happened? Do you understand
[7488.02s -> 7497.05s]  now? Anything over an eight, you have to hit if you don't have at least 18. You have to. Otherwise,
[7497.05s -> 7506.98s]  they flip over the 10, it's over. You lose. This is bad, but we're staying. You don't hit against
[7506.98s -> 7515.08s]  the 16 ever. You don't hit this. You just don't. That's why. See? Sit down. Sit down next to me.
[7515.32s -> 7528.36s]  Pull up a chair and learn something. This is bad. This is very bad. I have to hit. This is very bad.
[7528.36s -> 7536.06s]  I have to though. Thank you very much. I'll take notes. Take notes. I just won. See? That hand is
[7536.06s -> 7554.97s]  guaranteed to lose if you don't do what I just did. It's not lucky. It's statistics. Don't get a 10.
[7554.97s -> 7560.70s]  There you go. He's going to bust right there. Thank you. You can pay the debt back now. Yeah,
[7560.70s -> 7587.26s]  but I got $400 of fun money. Had to hit that. I'm going to get 10 right here. There it is.
[7589.35s -> 7596.31s]  Nothing. Nothing. 15. You're going to bust. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There it is. Yeah. I got $1,000 of fun
[7596.31s -> 7607.58s]  money. Let's go. 10. Let me give me an ace right now. Oh, you have money. Now I got $2,000 of fun
[7607.58s -> 7620.47s]  money. 14 versus an ace. Oh, it's over. All right. That's not bad. I win. Again. Let's go. All right.
[7620.47s -> 7636.57s]  Let's go. Come on. Last hand. Bingo. This is it. Give me 10. Oh, oh, you piece of shit.
[7637.21s -> 7655.18s]  Here's the money I owe you. Wonderful. Come back soon. Oh, he moves out of the way. Okay. I still
[7655.18s -> 7676.66s]  have money, right? 17 versus 2. Fuck. I'm staying. Lost. This is it. Last one. Blackjack. Oh, yes.
[7677.54s -> 7700.49s]  There it is. $20,000. Goodbye. I already paid it. Did I pay him twice? I didn't pay him twice,
[7700.49s -> 7714.73s]  right? I just paid him twice. What the hell? No. What? Fuck. Oh, it's all right. Whatever. I don't
[7714.73s -> 7726.60s]  care. I paid him. I paid him. I paid him twice. That was stupid. And I wanted to get that money
[7726.60s -> 7758.87s]  back. Use the telephone. Call Bear. What? What's your emergency? Send up something's wrong. I'm
[7758.87s -> 7761.27s]  sorry. There was an emergency. I'm playing an adventure game and I thought it'd be clever.
[7762.23s -> 7777.37s]  For sure. You're honest. They have a nice day. The door is locked. Use keypad. Wait, do I know
[7777.37s -> 7796.34s]  what this is? Okay. I don't know what the code is though. It's grandpa. What's on TV, grandpa?
[7797.14s -> 7816.12s]  TV's not on. There's nothing to look at. I just realized I don't even touch my nose when I say
[7816.12s -> 7836.01s]  that. Move out of the way, you little prick. You're blocking the TV. Grandpa, I thought you were dead.
[7836.94s -> 7842.76s]  I am dead. So what? You're acting like you've never seen a ghost before. Now move so I can
[7842.76s -> 7853.19s]  watch my soaps. What's the afterlife like? Yeah, it's not so bad. I had to crawl my way out of the
[7853.19s -> 7859.85s]  hell. But at least that was easier than working his damn remote. Oh, right. Uncle Ted sends his
[7859.85s -> 7883.83s]  love too. What am I? What the hell's going on on this TV? Oh, Steakums. How do I get those?
[7883.83s -> 7889.51s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, shit. Steak. Fuck. Whatever. I don't care.
[7890.23s -> 7917.43s]  555 yum. Oh shit. All right. 555 yum. What else is this like GTA? 555 yum. Hold on. Very bad, grandpa.

[7940.26s -> 7947.21s]  the line. Due to a recent recall and the resulting class action lawsuit, Steak Yum's LLC is legally

[7976.66s -> 7989.34s]  Here's another thousand bits. Thank you. I'm gonna bust. Oh, okay. Let's see. Exactly. We're good.
[7989.34s -> 7998.02s]  Blackjack. 17 versus five. No, don't do anything ever. No, I hit the wrong button. I hit the wrong
[7998.02s -> 8001.38s]  button. I hit the wrong button. I actually hit the wrong button. I thought Stan was on the left.
[8001.38s -> 8010.04s]  Oh my God. What the? That was stupid. I thought that was Stan. Give me more money. This is ridiculous.
[8010.04s -> 8013.56s]  How many more times you're going to lose all your money? Well, I paid you twice. So technically,
[8013.56s -> 8022.07s]  this is my money. I gave you an extra $5,000. So you actually owe me 3000 more dollars. So that's
[8022.07s -> 8033.21s]  how this is going to work. 12 versus three. Shit. Oh my God. Give me the money you owe me. You owe
[8033.21s -> 8041.74s]  me 3000 more dollars. Give it to me. You must be the unluckiest man in Las Vegas. Take the money.
[8041.74s -> 8052.94s]  Lose it all. I don't care. This sucks. I hate this. Oh my God. Give me a fucking break.
[8052.94s -> 8065.10s]  He still owes me two grand. I'm gonna get it. I might not just not going all in. You're going
[8065.10s -> 8071.58s]  to run me out of business. You owe me another thousand dollars. There it is. All right. Nobody
[8071.58s -> 8078.87s]  move. Oh my fucking God. Okay. I blame this on the fact that I gave him five extra thousand more
[8078.87s -> 8088.34s]  dollars and I accidentally hit when I had a guaranteed win. I feel like I've already given
[8088.34s -> 8098.15s]  you more than 5000 bits of you owe me. Just take it. 19. There it is. Come on. Don't accidentally
[8098.15s -> 8108.65s]  do anything stupid. 18. Give me it. Good. Again. Again. There is the 20 versus the 19. Stay.
[8109.21s -> 8119.26s]  Whatever. Whatever. You keep getting aces. That's stupid. 20 again. Stay. Don't move. You're not
[8119.26s -> 8121.42s]  going to get any. You're not going to get shit. You're going to get 18 and that's the win. All
[8121.42s -> 8129.42s]  right. Here we go. Last one. All in 4000 hand. Let's go. Here's your 10. Here comes your 10.
[8129.42s -> 8133.74s]  Again. 18. I'll take it. Stay against two. Thank you so much. I'll take that money. I'll take it.
[8133.74s -> 8140.94s]  We're going to do one more. We're going to do one more at. We're going to do one more 4000.
[8142.63s -> 8146.23s]  Thank you very much. That's it. This could be a push because it's probably a 10 under there.
[8147.11s -> 8150.87s]  It's not. There's 12,000 dollars. Thank you so much. We're going to do one more at two,
[8151.43s -> 8159.18s]  which gets a 16 versus six. Don't do anything. Don't listen to people in the chat that say to
[8159.18s -> 8165.37s]  do something. Sir, I don't care if I lost. That's how you play that hand. That's how you play that
[8165.37s -> 8199.08s]  hand. Fuck it. No. Oh, I got to check my mailbox. No insurance. Don't ever do insurance. Don't do
[8199.08s -> 8215.48s]  insurance. Are we going to go outside? Mailbox. Wow. The package from steak from meat yums is
[8215.48s -> 8226.22s]  here already. That was speedy. Definitely been in there for too long. Okay. Now I just need. What
[8226.22s -> 8250.06s]  do I need? Mayo. Right. Okay. Get this in here. I got to do the maze. Let me get this in here first.
[8250.70s -> 8263.22s]  Was there something else I could do over here? I feel like there was. Okay. Is the phone. I need
[8263.22s -> 8270.41s]  the keypad to get in this door. Oh, grandpa. Right. Let me talk to grandpa. There's another
[8270.41s -> 8280.23s]  hallway. What else is down here? Framed picture. Jerma is a river in southeastern Serbia and western
[8280.23s -> 8286.74s]  Bulgaria. It is notable for passing the Serbian Bulgarian border twice. The Jerma originates in
[8286.74s -> 8293.62s]  the under and the undeveloped and sparsely populated area of Kragist in the southeastern
[8293.62s -> 8299.88s]  corner of Serbia. Starting from the area between the artificial lake Vlasina and the Bulgarian
[8299.88s -> 8305.08s]  border, it flows to the northwest on the eastern slopes of the Gramada mountain. Passing through
[8305.08s -> 8310.44s]  the village of Klesura, after which it enters an arid region stretching over the border into
[8310.44s -> 8315.80s]  Bulgaria. This is where the Jerma crosses the border for the first time and at the border crossing
[8316.68s -> 8327.91s]  of Strezimrivoci. Okay. Bathroom. Hair dryer. No, thanks. My hair is already dry.
[8328.55s -> 8344.79s]  Okay. Can I use the toilet? All right. Computer number two. This is my number two
[8345.67s -> 8354.84s]  I mean my second computer that I use for business reasons. Okay. Anything else I can do? Nothing on
[8354.84s -> 8359.48s]  the ground or anything? I feel like I'm going to need this. My hair is already dry. All right.
[8359.80s -> 8370.38s]  I'll probably have to come back here later. The mirror. There is. All right. That is funny. Okay.
[8370.38s -> 8391.75s]  Basement. This is kind of creepy. Oh, shit. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on.
[8394.78s -> 8404.38s]  I gotta get this right. Give me one second. Give me just one quick second here. I'm going to make
[8404.38s -> 8418.44s]  it, you know, okay. Oh, yes. Okay. Oh, it's my good friend. He's a wonderful, wonderful man from what
[8418.44s -> 8435.85s]  I've seen. What are you doing down in my basement? What does it look like on your own business?
[8440.33s -> 8451.54s]  What are you doing down here? What do I do? Hot roast? I don't think this works with that.
[8453.90s -> 8467.96s]  So what? Banana peel? Okay. Wait, turn off the light. I gotta bring obviously have to bring
[8467.96s -> 8485.35s]  bugleberry something. Banana on the rumor? Yeah, I was thinking that too. Maybe grandpa has something.
[8485.35s -> 8493.14s]  Let's see. How did you die? What? You don't remember? I suppose I was a few years ago.
[8493.86s -> 8498.66s]  As I remember Demon Lord Zaraxas chokeslam me into hell, completely obliterating my spinal cord.
[8499.82s -> 8503.34s]  Can't live without a spinal cord, son. Nothing unnatural about that.
[8504.30s -> 8511.10s]  Yeah, I suppose you're right. What are you watching? There's nothing good on TV anymore,
[8511.10s -> 8517.34s]  except for that steak yum commercial. It's got a good jingle. What's the afterlife like?
[8518.34s -> 8525.50s]  It's not so bad. I already told you this. I told you already everything that you just wanted to know.
[8528.46s -> 8544.38s]  On a pot roast? I don't think that works. Put the hairdryer in the tub. What? Are you telling me to
[8544.38s -> 8557.38s]  kill bugleberry? What's wrong with you? Here's a tip I use all the time back in my chocolate
[8557.38s -> 8562.10s]  making days. If you ever make money, save. If you ever lose money, load an old save.
[8562.10s -> 8571.35s]  Infinite money glitch. Oh, this is, I hate when you need something like this versus three.
[8572.07s -> 8575.91s]  Because you can make so many things with a three, but I can't make very much anything with a 16.
[8576.63s -> 8581.35s]  I'm just gonna, I'm gonna stay. He's gonna bust right here. Yeah, that sucks. Like there's not
[8581.35s -> 8585.27s]  much I can do there. And if I had taken that card, it would have been 21, which that sucks.
[8585.91s -> 8602.71s]  One more time. Hit. 13 versus eight. That sucks. Hit again. 15 versus eight. That sucks. Even more.
[8602.71s -> 8615.54s]  Hit again. Okay. We're good. All right. All right. We're back. We're back. 12 versus 10. That sucks.
[8615.54s -> 8620.36s]  Come on. Give me something low. Okay. All right. We're good. We're back. We're back. All right. One
[8620.36s -> 8627.13s]  more of those. And then this is actually it. I'm done. This is the big one right here. 13 versus
[8627.13s -> 8630.81s]  seven. I have to hit that. It's going to be low. Thank you 21. Goodbye. Take it. Put it in the bank.
[8632.39s -> 8642.76s]  Put it in the bank. Here's that money I owe you. Wonderful. Come back. All right. Good. We're good.
[8643.40s -> 8667.96s]  Should have like four grand. Go outside. I gotta, I gotta figure this out.
[8667.96s -> 8670.92s]  Bob watchers skip one hour. All right. So what, what, how do we do this?
[8671.78s -> 8697.13s]  Go to the exit, the right. Okay. So I can go up or left. I'm going to go up and then left again,
[8700.18s -> 8729.00s]  then left again and left again, up or down. I'm going to say up, up again, right, down,
[8729.00s -> 8753.93s]  up or right. I think I'm going to bunker door. It looks like an old nuclear fallout bunker
[8759.86s -> 8771.61s]  generator. Lots of fumes coming out of this one. Wall dad looks like a construction worker. How
[8771.61s -> 8782.38s]  long has he been in my walls? Yeah. What was that? Jason, you've come back. Wait, you're not Jason.
[8783.02s -> 8788.68s]  My name is Jeremy. Who's Jason? What are you doing in my wall? My son, Jason, he was supposed to
[8788.68s -> 8796.52s]  bring me my pot roast for dinner ages ago. Well, I guess it's canceled because I can't get that
[8796.52s -> 8802.60s]  kind of food. So I'll have canned beans instead. Do you know how to turn the internet back on?
[8803.32s -> 8812.66s]  Well, sure I do. I did all the wiring around the house. I would help you, but I'm just so hungry
[8812.66s -> 8818.44s]  thinking about that pot roast. I simply could not lift a finger until I've eaten. It's not very
[8818.44s -> 8828.02s]  helpful. You know where Otto is? Otto, is that one of Jason's friends? I haven't seen him around.
[8828.66s -> 8837.27s]  No, nevermind. Okay. How long have you been in here for? It's hard to tell. Days turn into months
[8837.27s -> 8843.50s]  in here. Fumes from that generator sure don't help. Oh, well, it's a living. You make money
[8843.50s -> 8852.22s]  being in here? Not really. Just an expression. There you go. Well, pot roast, no way. Oh,
[8852.22s -> 8860.68s]  oh. Oh, I don't feel so good. I was going to help you with the internet, but here,
[8860.68s -> 8865.40s]  take the screwdriver. Just open the electrical box on the telephone pole outside. I'm going to
[8866.20s -> 8879.64s]  lay down for a while. Nice. Very nice. I'm going to get going. Pretty good setup you got down here.
[8882.70s -> 8896.52s]  Hey, don't touch that. Okay. Oh, I got to skip. Now, let's go to the internet.
[8897.16s -> 8915.82s]  It's the hearthstone noise. Touch that. And then we'll come down to the banana pill on the road.
[8917.27s -> 8921.83s]  Hey, Mike Toyota, thanks for the 20 community subs. Appreciate it. 20 subs. There's been like
[8921.83s -> 8950.09s]  three or four of those. Open sesame. Oh, God. Okay. What am I supposed to do? Oh, that was easy.
[8951.37s -> 8963.58s]  QTE of the day brought to you by. I mean, there's nothing to do with this.
[8964.78s -> 8976.52s]  This has nothing to do with this. Okay, so did I get the internet back on?
[8977.32s -> 8985.74s]  All right. Internet sorted. No problem. Very cool. All right, let's do this.
[8986.46s -> 9008.65s]  I think this works. I think I just killed somebody. An O from Otto. Note to self. Not a good lead.
[9008.65s -> 9013.61s]  Why would the rumor know anything anyways? He's never even seen the cookies. I should talk to
[9013.61s -> 9018.33s]  Jax. I saw him snooping around yesterday looking for a snack. The code to his room is
[9018.89s -> 9034.31s]  Omega LUL. Cookies. Okay, Omega LUL. Let's pretend like this didn't happen. All right.
[9036.41s -> 9050.57s]  Omega LUL. That's on this door down here. Wait, I can use the freezer. Frozen cheese.
[9053.75s -> 9060.70s]  Wait, I can get the key here. How is the rat going to smell the cheese if it's frozen?
[9060.70s -> 9066.68s]  I have to cook it. Cheese in the oven? There's no way I'm opening that again.
[9066.68s -> 9089.21s]  Cheese in the microwave? Oh, yep. Hair dryer. Okay, Omega LUL. What was it? It's LUL. What is L?
[9089.77s -> 9115.37s]  Which one of these is L? Omega? Which one's U? What's U? LUL. Got it. Okay. That's what the Omega
[9115.37s -> 9134.10s]  symbol is. Yeah, I know what it is. Oh, this is the old room. Cool. Okay. Hey, sorry for interrupting.
[9134.10s -> 9141.34s]  Have you seen Otto? A note of his said he was going to talk to you. Otto? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Right.
[9142.06s -> 9147.10s]  He was in here a little while ago asking me about cookies. He left this note here, but I'm way too
[9147.10s -> 9152.41s]  busy to reach into my pocket and fish it out. If I beat your high score, would you put down the
[9152.41s -> 9159.42s]  light gun for one second? You beating my high score? Didn't you die to pinwheel? You can try,
[9159.42s -> 9171.03s]  I guess. I also beat Dark Souls on stream, you know. You gonna let me play? Sure. Stop whining.
[9171.99s -> 9193.78s]  Mad Dog's Bottle Busters. Okay. I thought I just killed him. Where is it? Where is it? What's the
[9193.78s -> 9232.55s]  high score? I don't have ammo. It's probably a thousand points, right? 10,000 points? Damn it.
[9232.55s -> 9252.89s]  I got it. That's definitely a thousand. 1,200. Is that enough? You don't have to hit all of them.
[9252.89s -> 9261.37s]  But you actually did it? Beat my high score? That's right. The god gamer himself in the flesh. Now,
[9261.37s -> 9266.39s]  where's that note from Otto? Right. Sorry. I'm still in shock here. Here you go. Take it.
[9266.39s -> 9271.72s]  The cookie trail has gone cold. Jack doesn't know where the cookies are,
[9271.72s -> 9276.87s]  and I'm beginning to lose hope that I'll ever find the cookies. The only clue I have left
[9276.87s -> 9283.82s]  is the trail of water I found leading to the basement. Time to pay a visit to B.F. Bugleberry.
[9283.82s -> 9302.01s]  See what he can tell us. Oh, you can just play. Okay. Down to the basement. Maybe we'll have new
[9302.01s -> 9326.15s]  dialogue with Bugleberry. Wait. Let's do this. Very cool. Mm. Ooey gooey cheese. Let's do the
[9326.15s -> 9343.35s]  rat thing first because I feel like I'm going to need a key. Into the kitchen. Okay. Here's the
[9343.35s -> 9358.60s]  cheese. Thank you. I'm going to assume I can open this door now. It's the only lock in the whole
[9358.60s -> 9380.97s]  house. Huh? Oh, shit. I can make the sandwich. All right. Let's get the sandwich made. Perfect.
[9380.97s -> 9397.94s]  Now time to turn it on and get cooking. Make the perfect sandwich. Very good. Perfect. I was
[9397.94s -> 9403.45s]  starving. Feels like I haven't eaten anything all day. Well, you know what I mean. All right.
[9403.45s -> 9413.21s]  Now we have to go find Otto. Close the fridge? I just did. Go to the basement. Talk to Bugleberry.
[9420.74s -> 9429.54s]  Basement's all the way over here, right? Yeah. Oh, gamble? No. I don't need to.
[9438.17s -> 9451.67s]  Okay. God. Otto said you'd be down here. Do you know where the cookies went? Cookies? Ah, yes.
[9451.67s -> 9461.53s]  I've been using the cookies as ingredients in my cauldron. I have one left. What? I'm
[9461.53s -> 9468.33s]  guessing you need me to solve some convoluted puzzle for you. How did you know? I've been trying
[9468.33s -> 9472.73s]  to follow the recipe for the perfect German character, but the page in my book has been
[9472.73s -> 9480.14s]  ripped to pieces. If you can recreate the recipe for me, I'll give you the last cookie. I will.
[9480.94s -> 9496.31s]  Take a look at that recipe. Okay. In this order, these symbols in this order. Is this important
[9496.31s -> 9509.62s]  too? Is this the Greek alphabet? Hold on. What was it? No, no, no, no, no. Hold on.
[9509.62s -> 9540.89s]  I just want to see what happens. Jeremy Germstar. All right. That was an interesting one.
[9541.45s -> 9548.39s]  It's not the one we're looking for. I want to do that again. All right. We're going to do blue and
[9548.39s -> 9576.18s]  green. Blue, blue, green, green, and then red. Oh no, purple. And New Year's German. It's a
[9576.18s -> 9581.83s]  gotcha game. Well, that was an interesting one, but it's not the one we're looking for.
[9585.34s -> 9593.86s]  All right. What's the actual one? Let me see the recipe. Okay. Circle, square, triangle, star,
[9593.94s -> 9601.24s]  triangle in those colors ordered. Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle, red, green. I gotta
[9601.24s -> 9613.80s]  write this down. I haven't tweet this stream out. Don't write it down. How am I going to remember
[9613.80s -> 9623.02s]  this? Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle, red, green, purple, blue, yellow, red, green,
[9623.02s -> 9631.32s]  purple, red, green, purple, red, green, purple, circle, red, circle. There's no red circle.
[9633.66s -> 9645.98s]  There's no red circle. Where is it? Circle, square, triangle, star, triangle in this order.
[9650.47s -> 9658.55s]  Oh, it doesn't. Okay. So I just have to do circle. These are the symbols. So what's, what's not on
[9658.55s -> 9674.14s]  here? Circle, square, triangle, star, no hearts, no hearts at all. I get it. Okay. So we need to do
[9674.14s -> 9684.22s]  red, green, red, green, purple, blue, yellow, red, green, purple, blue, yellow, red, green.
[9686.06s -> 9704.74s]  I have to write it down. Purple, blue, yellow. I think I got it. I'm just going to write it down.
[9704.74s -> 9716.06s]  Why would I? You write shit down on these games. Just write it down. I'm writing it down. I'm
[9716.06s -> 9723.43s]  writing it down. I'm going to write it down. Okay. Why are there two triangles up there?
[9723.99s -> 9739.78s]  Oh, I have to use two triangles. I'm writing it down. Did I read this? I've read this, right? Met
[9739.78s -> 9744.66s]  a couple at a random restaurant who told me about a wrestler dying. I don't know them and don't know
[9744.66s -> 9749.30s]  the wrestler. I was in a city I do not know at all. I may have been visiting. I was invited to
[9749.30s -> 9754.86s]  his funeral and was trying to be polite and said yes. A couple then sent me a referral link to a
[9754.86s -> 9763.18s]  weird online system to accept the invite slash make payments. I ignored it and went back to my room.
[9763.74s -> 9769.50s]  I got ready to go, was in a full suit, and took a car a few miles away to the spot I met the couple.
[9769.50s -> 9775.18s]  I had the address written down for the funeral, but left it in my room. For some reason, I figured
[9775.18s -> 9781.02s]  it was right across the street from the restaurant we met. I couldn't find it. I looked everywhere.
[9781.02s -> 9786.62s]  After an hour or so, I went back to my room and said fuck it. After a while, I got a phone call
[9786.62s -> 9791.50s]  from the couple who asked if I was still going. The funeral was well underway and I didn't want
[9791.50s -> 9797.58s]  to just walk in at the end. They gave me the address and it was a 50 minute drive from my room.
[9798.22s -> 9802.54s]  They started having bad reception and told me to sign up for their referral link again before I
[9802.54s -> 9816.04s]  hung up. It was a dream I had. Did I tell you guys that one? Did I go over that one before?
[9816.04s -> 9825.46s]  No? I wrote it down. That's when I woke up. What was I doing? Oh right, I was writing this down.
[9825.46s -> 9834.41s]  Hold on, let me write this down. Why did he read it like he's never seen it? I mean I have seen
[9834.41s -> 9841.90s]  it before. It's been a while. That was December of 2020 is when I had that dream. Okay,
[9842.70s -> 9853.22s]  let's keep going. What was I writing this down? A note. New note. Okay, circle, square, triangle,
[9856.06s -> 9876.97s]  R, triangle. The order is red, green, purple, blue. All right, let's do it. Okay, so circle.
[9877.77s -> 9892.10s]  I need red. A red square. There's no red circle so we're gonna do red square. Green
[9892.98s -> 9907.91s]  square. No, green triangle. Thank you. And then we need to do purple. Purple
[9909.67s -> 9926.58s]  circle and then blue star. Yellow triangle. Oh fuck, what happened? Yellow circle?
[9927.94s -> 9935.10s]  It said there was two triangles. There's only one. It's orange. Isn't that orange?
[9935.10s -> 9956.70s]  Just use the triangle. Catboy! Is that the one? That's it. My finest creation yet.
[9957.34s -> 9964.38s]  Chad is going to love this. Just think of all the fan art. As promised, here is the last cookie.
[9965.26s -> 9967.90s]  No need to throw. I wouldn't if I were you.
[9968.54s -> 9977.38s]  I should take this back to Otto's bed. He can smell cookies from a mile away.
[9983.98s -> 10024.33s]  Off-brand bugleberry. That's, no, I, whatever. Let's go see if we can find him. Somebody said,
[10024.33s -> 10034.31s]  Jesus Christ. It's not real. It's not real money. It's not real as my bank account is not linked to
[10034.31s -> 10050.74s]  the game. Okay, here we go. Do we do it? Otto! It's Otto, the wonder dog. Ready for your walk?
[10050.74s -> 10068.15s]  That was a great walk. Hey, where'd Otto go? Where is he? Is there another note?
[10073.53s -> 10090.12s]  No. Backyard? Was it chocolate on that? What's the thing that, what is it?
[10090.12s -> 10092.52s]  It's something that is like chocolate but it's not chocolate. What's it called?
[10096.89s -> 10122.38s]  Carib. Yeah. Where's Otto? This had to have been finished very recently, right? Because this was
[10122.38s -> 10129.77s]  only like a month or two ago. This is a couple months ago. Be able to add all this? All the
[10129.77s -> 10145.38s]  dollhouse references? That had been pretty late in development. Where's Otto? Who's a good boy?
[10146.52s -> 10160.42s]  Otto. That's so cute. Is it time to stream? Let's see. I got an achievement that just said
[10160.42s -> 10186.25s]  minus two worst stream of the year. Blinking. I was just lost in my brain trying to find any
[10186.25s -> 10194.86s]  game. You can just see the cogs turning to like just say any video game. I have no idea. What was
[10194.86s -> 10214.57s]  the last thing I played? And that was really fun. Those two were really cool. Game by William
[10214.57s -> 10228.42s]  Enders aka 14 hour lunch break aka dev in chat art. Very good job. That was very cute. Additional
[10228.42s -> 10239.42s]  3D models. Look at that. Yeah, well done. That was really, that was really fun. Excellent, excellent
[10239.42s -> 10251.85s]  work. Both of the development teams that made these games. Jeff McCloud. Jeff McCloud is just,
[10252.41s -> 10269.66s]  he's the Picasso of royalty free music. Special thanks. German voice line emporium.
[10269.66s -> 10281.40s]  What? That exists? Very cool. Steam support team. I don't know. Was there an issue? I wonder.
[10281.40s -> 10295.34s]  Hey, thanks for making it. It's really fun. It doesn't know that there's a voice treasury
[10295.34s -> 10304.36s]  of everything he's ever said. Well, whatever. No, don't do this. We have to do this every...
[10304.44s -> 10304.84s]  Fine.
[10318.55s -> 10322.97s]  All right. We got, we got our expectations subverted three times there.
[10322.97s -> 10334.01s]  Very cool. Oh, I got an achievement plus two. If you're getting the German cough emporium,
[10334.01s -> 10341.53s]  the German sneeze emporium and the German yawn emporium. Why? Why do you want all that?
[10346.95s -> 10357.32s]  Why do you want a bunch of times that I've like coughed? That was really cool. I'm very happy
[10357.32s -> 10368.30s]  with that. That was a lot of fun. So now those are the two of the community games I wanted to play.
[10368.94s -> 10381.69s]  What am I? Don't what? End of the stream voice? Um, I actually probably maybe because
[10382.57s -> 10389.99s]  I want to get back to like Saturday, Sunday. So we're probably going to just go Saturday, Sunday
[10390.47s -> 10395.91s]  to kind of get back to normal here. Three hour Andy. I did say it was only going to be a three
[10395.91s -> 10399.91s]  hour stream on Twitter. Did I even tweet that? No, I didn't. What? Am I misremembering that?
[10402.22s -> 10408.30s]  I tweeted, right? What? What did I say on the tweet? Playing a couple of fan games,
[10408.30s -> 10413.83s]  hanging out for a few hours. All right. I said that. Yeah. Yeah. I want to do Saturday, Sunday.
[10413.83s -> 10417.83s]  I want to get back to that because like I said, I don't want to be once a week anymore. I want to
[10417.83s -> 10424.26s]  be like twice a week. So we'll, we can call it here. I'll be back on Saturday, Sunday for more
[10424.26s -> 10436.22s]  longer, substantial streams. Not just three hours. A few is eight hours. But I want to get in the
[10436.22s -> 10440.38s]  habit of even if I'm not going to be around for that long, I still want to pop in for a few hours,
[10440.38s -> 10449.21s]  like at least two times a week. I'm slowly trying to get back to not doing once a week anymore.
[10449.21s -> 10452.65s]  And we'll see going forward. I'm going to keep trying to add them as I can.
[10454.49s -> 10462.04s]  And I will see you guys on Saturday. We'll do Saturday, Sunday. I have plans. If you don't
[10462.04s -> 10466.79s]  know what the Halloween plan is, although that's next weekend, we're going to be watching a bunch
[10466.79s -> 10472.39s]  of public domain movies on Halloween like we did last time. That was one of the funnest streams ever.
[10473.03s -> 10477.19s]  Hopefully we have a good time again. We're going to watch at least three or four plus hours,
[10477.83s -> 10484.73s]  even more, maybe five plus hours of old shitty movies. See if we can find some. And by the way,
[10484.73s -> 10488.63s]  there's a possibility we might see the Ritz brothers return. I think they have another one
[10488.63s -> 10495.56s]  or two that we could watch. But to the people that made, and there's other community games too
[10496.36s -> 10504.81s]  that exist. I know during the community content nights, I know a couple of them came in. So this
[10504.81s -> 10512.25s]  is fun to do. I'd like to compile them every now and then. Really, really good job. This is really
[10512.25s -> 10516.94s]  fun. It's shocking to me that if somebody wants to put the amount of time that it takes to make
[10516.94s -> 10524.31s]  something like this just for fun and just to maybe have people play it and enjoy it and be connected
[10524.31s -> 10529.43s]  to this community and the stream and everything, it's mind blowing. So I hope it was fun to work
[10529.43s -> 10537.50s]  on. It was really fun to play. But that's going to be the end of the stream. I will see you guys
[10537.50s -> 10542.55s]  on Saturday, Sunday. We will get back to normal on the Saturday, Sunday, weekend, Andy schedule.
[10542.55s -> 10556.34s]  Let's do a raid. We raid, raid, raid Neanderthals? Yeah, sure. Yeah, let's go. I haven't raided
[10556.34s -> 10575.67s]  somebody in a while. What is Neanderthals playing? Minecraft? Time for a raid song? No, no more. Hey,
[10575.67s -> 10580.71s]  nobody wants to do the raid song. Nobody wants to do the raid song. The raid song was not,
[10580.71s -> 10585.77s]  I'm telling you right now, as comedy professor, your comedy professor, we talked about it like
[10585.77s -> 10593.21s]  two or three hours ago. That, that's not, yeah, that gets you removed from the class. By the way,
[10593.21s -> 10598.41s]  I want to make this clear too. If somebody farts into a baked Lays bag and you come in the next
[10598.41s -> 10603.06s]  day and fart into a baked Lays bag, I'm going to send you home, right? You can't, we can't have
[10603.06s -> 10608.58s]  like 30 people all fart into a baked Lays bag at the same time the next day, right? That person
[10608.58s -> 10613.53s]  got an A. You gotta do something else. And there's people that probably just came in like 20 minutes
[10613.53s -> 10620.54s]  ago that have no idea what we're talking about. It's fine. Go say hello to Neanderthals. I will
[10620.54s -> 10625.05s]  talk to you guys on Saturday. Have a great one. We will do some longer streams on Saturday,
[10625.05s -> 10629.83s]  Sunday. I have a lot of things I want to prepare. Thanks for watching. As always,
[10629.83s -> 10634.39s]  the community shit is awesome. I love to do it. I wish we could still do the community video stuff,
[10634.39s -> 10639.83s]  but I can't play eight minutes uninterrupted of Star Wars. That would get me removed,
[10639.83s -> 10647.13s]  I believe, from the platform. So we can't do that anymore. I'm surprised we got away with it as long
[10647.13s -> 10655.61s]  as we did, if I'm very honest with you. So, unfortunately, but if we can do stuff like this,
[10655.61s -> 10659.88s]  I'd love to do it. So have a great rest of your night. Thanks for hanging out for the few hours
[10659.88s -> 10668.22s]  that we were here. See you Saturday at 2pm Pacific. Good night. Goodbye. See you soon.
[10668.22s -> 10686.84s]  Oh my God. Wait, I didn't even do the outro. What the fuck? No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[10686.84s -> 10694.54s]  it's too fast. Oh, I thought it was ending right now. Okay, I thought it was actually like you were
[10694.54s -> 10704.12s]  getting sent in now. I just fucking panicked. I wanted to do the subs too. I just was queuing
[10704.12s -> 10711.45s]  up the raid. That was actual panic. Oh my God. That scared the shit out of me for some reason.
[10711.45s -> 10717.72s]  I saw the bar on my screen was going in five seconds. I'm sorry. Oh shit, we're gonna- I'm
[10717.72s -> 10722.46s]  gonna have to cancel this. Can we get through the subs? I can't believe there's this many people
[10722.46s -> 10728.78s]  that still subbed to the channel. This is insane. We're not even gonna get through the Ds by the
[10728.78s -> 10738.09s]  time the raid happens. We're only in the Ds. We're in the Gs. I have to cancel the raid.
[10739.13s -> 10744.98s]  I have to cancel it. We'll do it again in a second. Just wait. Yeah, I'm canceling the raid. We have
[10744.98s -> 10751.59s]  to do it again in a second. I'm sorry. Wait, somebody just gave subs and it superseded my
[10751.59s -> 10758.79s]  ability to cancel the raid. I can't cancel the raid anymore. It's- 8-bit just gave 10 community
[10758.79s -> 10763.75s]  subs and I can't click any buttons now. It's taking over. You're just gonna go. I'm so sorry.
[10763.75s -> 10766.90s]  Oh my God, I can't stop it.
