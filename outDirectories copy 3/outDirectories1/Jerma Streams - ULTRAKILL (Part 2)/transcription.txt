[0.76s -> 5.27s]  All right, fun. That was Disney Infinity 3.0. I couldn't, I couldn't even get it to fucking turn on.
[5.27s -> 16.84s]  Um, okay, great. So now, uh, should I try Ultra Kill? I know they had the new update, right?
[16.84s -> 33.22s]  Does Steam Cloud work for this game? Because I'm gonna be in trouble if it doesn't.
[33.22s -> 36.74s]  Because I had to uninstall a bunch of stuff and I uninstalled Ultra Kill.
[36.74s -> 46.86s]  So hopefully it worked. I'm gonna be sad if I have to start over.
[46.86s -> 51.74s]  Dude, what is going on right now? Disney Infinity 3.0 broke my computer.
[51.74s -> 63.40s]  These are all set the right way, right? I think so. I think we're good.
[63.40s -> 79.06s]  I gotta remember how to play though. There we go. All right, so we are, which one was I on?
[79.06s -> 105.54s]  5.1? Harmless lenient standard. I swear to God, Disney Infinity broke the computer.
[105.54s -> 125.56s]  Standard, right? So Act 2? I did this. Layer 5. Wrath. Let's go.
[125.56s -> 131.78s]  Okay, so I gotta, how do you play? I gotta remember how to play the game. This is important.
[131.78s -> 148.22s]  All right, let's go. Act 2. How do you play? This is my favorite game. This game is sick.
[148.22s -> 154.02s]  I just gotta remember how to do everything. What are the buttons?
[157.16s -> 163.35s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jump, dash, left shift, slide, left control, weapons. Okay.
[164.38s -> 178.95s]  Don't weapons have like powers too? Yep, you can dash in the air.
[178.95s -> 211.16s]  How am I going? Blue hook points act as slingshots. How do I grab that? R? Oh, okay, yep. Cool.
[211.16s -> 228.71s]  It's an underwater level. I already don't like it. Checkpoint.
[228.71s -> 236.73s]  Does not build up hard damage while underwater. Go nuts. Have fun.
[236.73s -> 254.84s]  Oh yeah, I have the machine gun. You can get rid of all the bullets, right?
[269.69s -> 285.64s]  Underwater sounds make me want to puke. Okay, we good? Yeah, it's a new update.
[285.64s -> 295.91s]  This is all new. Whatever it is. So I can choose a few. Oh, thank God.
[295.91s -> 333.69s]  Shit. All right. Oh my God. You're, you're alive. Oh my goodness. I feel like I'm on drugs. What?
[333.69s -> 398.44s]  Stop. How do I sink? Okay. No. Oh, I need sound. Dude, this is just proving to me just how much
[398.44s -> 406.98s]  audio is important for me when I play a game. I can't play. It's like, I can't see. You know
[406.98s -> 452.54s]  what I mean? I can't see. I actually can't see. By the way, this is, this is, I don't want it there.
[452.54s -> 485.98s]  Okay. Way better. I can actually use this now. I'm playing with no sound.
[485.98s -> 521.85s]  That's the only way I can do it. What is doing that? Why am I taking so much damage?
[521.85s -> 538.84s]  How do you heal? What's the, there's a heal? What's the heal? I haven't played so long.
[538.84s -> 554.10s]  How do you heal? Blood? You forgot everything. I've played like 150 games since I played this.
[554.10s -> 573.24s]  It's mouse four. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Change arm. Oh shit. Hold on. Weapons have
[573.24s -> 580.89s]  two modes. Oh, I have to think about this. Fuel is blood. You're all you have. Right, right, right.
[580.89s -> 598.58s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. What is change arm? Right. Okay. I have a punch. I want whiplash on mouse four.
[598.58s -> 604.78s]  Very right. Okay. You can switch these. I don't need to read what these do again
[604.78s -> 620.04s]  because this has a different mode too, right? Yeah. What mode did I like? I think I like the
[620.04s -> 631.67s]  shotgun. What's punch? House five. I'm going to make it like V or something, right? Maybe middle
[631.67s -> 707.53s]  mouse. Okay. Let's try this. You play Madagascar too? Um, no. Shit. Oh, no. I fucking fell. Where
[707.53s -> 721.67s]  am I? Oh, this is brutal. Floating around in the water is like, I can't think of a thing that I
[721.67s -> 769.11s]  would rather not do than this. I'm in trouble. Where is it? Where am I? I feel like I'm cooking
[769.11s -> 776.65s]  with like eight pans on a burner and they're all almost done. And I'm like, oh shit. Wait,
[776.65s -> 780.41s]  hold on. Grab that switch and flip that. I got up with the patties done and everything's about to
[780.41s -> 872.14s]  burn. Give me the health. I don't want to fucking float around. What are you doing? Um, die? I did
[872.14s -> 886.10s]  it. Did I do it? Thank God. Oh, how long am I in the water level for? Please say five minutes.
[886.10s -> 895.45s]  I hated the shit in Mario too. Every time it was a water level. I just, okay. Can one of my friends
[895.45s -> 919.11s]  play for like an hour? God, I need the skull. All right. I guess I'm going to go this way. Wait,
[919.11s -> 935.93s]  there's a skull in there. Can I go back in here? Was there a skull in here? There was. Okay. How
[935.93s -> 965.77s]  do I pick it up? You look like a carrot. Thanks. Is that a thank you? All right, let's go. Oh,
[965.77s -> 1038.23s]  I can breathe. Get out of here. What did I just do to myself? What happened? Oh, that's the special
[1038.23s -> 1052.86s]  move for that. That thing explodes in your hand. I forgot how it works. Hold on. How's it work?
[1052.86s -> 1082.09s]  Okay. So if you do it more than once, one, two. Okay. One, two. Okay. I get it. What was this?
[1082.09s -> 1090.82s]  What was that? Secret? Ooh. What'd I get for that? Get me out of the fucking water. I hate water so
[1090.82s -> 1101.91s]  much. Dude, if I could drain every lake in every video game I've ever played, I would. I want water
[1101.91s -> 1147.67s]  to be scenery, not a gameplay mechanic. I don't even know what is fucking happening right now.
[1147.67s -> 1184.55s]  You literally just played a fish game. Yeah, but I would have drained that lake. Shit. I got no
[1184.55s -> 1201.58s]  health. Dude, am I crazy or is this like a hundred times harder than what I did last? Am I on the
[1201.58s -> 1208.06s]  wrong difficulty? I feel like this is unbelievably harder than it used to be. Am I playing on the
[1208.06s -> 1233.58s]  wrong difficulty? Skill issue. Dude, I don't know. Holy shit. All right. Come on. Let me get
[1233.90s -> 1300.31s]  fucking, let me sit up a little. Bro. Oh, I need that fucking health. This guy's got to die
[1300.31s -> 1345.91s]  immediately. I didn't mean to do that. Jesus Christ. What is happening? Who's shooting me with
[1345.91s -> 1439.13s]  this stuff? Even throwing a coin? Dude. Oh yeah. Don't hit me. What the fuck is happening? No
[1439.13s -> 1504.97s]  fucking way. Did that go through your legs? Oh, where'd he go? Holy shit. That was hard.
[1505.45s -> 1515.24s]  I didn't even know what was going on. I didn't know where I was. Holy shit. That was like omega
[1515.24s -> 1536.71s]  hard. Okay. So what? One more through here. Stop saying omega because it's omega weekend. Dude,
[1536.71s -> 1560.87s]  that was omega hard, right? Where are you? There you are. Why am I here? Okay. Thank goodness.
[1560.87s -> 1636.42s]  No checkpoint. Fucking water. Don't kill me. That was way, that was like nothing in comparison.
[1636.42s -> 1664.58s]  Okay. There's that checkpoint. I didn't get the points to the health of that.
[1664.58s -> 1679.24s]  Why? There's a parry too. I forgot. What's the parry?
[1722.09s -> 1757.75s]  Interrupting sentries. Red arm. Oh, okay. That's right. Punch. Don't kick me. Oh,
[1757.75s -> 1808.41s]  that was pretty sick. Hey, for anarchy. Anarchy. What the heck? I need that blood so bad.
[1813.66s -> 1864.70s]  Whoa. Yikes. Oh, I did it. That was insane. That was actually insane.
[1864.70s -> 1881.22s]  Genuinely. That was ridiculous. That was, that was hard. Don't touch any water. How would you do
[1881.22s -> 1906.12s]  that? Don't touch water in the water level. Hold on. I need to read this. Okay. Coin to deflect.
[1906.12s -> 1917.78s]  One of them is a charge. Let me see. Let me play with it. Right. Okay. Yep. Okay. This next one,
[1917.78s -> 1928.36s]  the shotgun has a couple things. Overheat and launch the shotgun's core. Yep. Pump the shotgun.
[1928.92s -> 1934.94s]  Too many pumps will make it blow up. Okay. Nail gun. Let me see what these were.
[1934.94s -> 1939.56s]  Shoots the magnet. Okay. I know that. What does this one do?
[1940.92s -> 1948.15s]  Alt-fire while shooting to overheat. So it goes. Yep. Okay. Rail cannon. This is new.
[1948.71s -> 1956.68s]  Because this one is just boom. A piercing instant piercing shot.
[1956.68s -> 1961.08s]  Pierces through all enemies. Pay attention to your piercing position to maximize destruction
[1961.08s -> 1974.73s]  of piercing. Don't use it in water. Oh, okay. Why is the game so hard? Am I crazy or is this
[1974.73s -> 1980.76s]  game way harder now? I was doing like 50% of my health every time I did that in the water.
[1980.76s -> 1992.82s]  Drill. Okay. All right. What is malicious? All right. Cool. Yeah. This game is sick. Let's go.
[2007.58s -> 2018.04s]  Hold. Punch. Yep. Yes. So this is a, you go whack. I not do it now. How would this be?
[2019.00s -> 2040.52s]  What do they make melee? Didn't I? Oh, I can't do it. All right. Let's do it. Five two. Okay.
[2041.16s -> 2101.93s]  I looked at chat. My fault. That does not hurt. Oh, the game's crashed. Oh, no. It's asking me
[2101.93s -> 2140.95s]  if I want to do sticky keys. Why does sticky keys exist? You know, in 2022, I really could not
[2140.95s -> 2171.94s]  answer that. I have no idea. I don't know if it has to have some use. Don't fall. Shit. Sponge him.
[2179.48s -> 2196.33s]  I need to kill this thing very quickly. Where are you? Oh, my goodness. Oh,
[2198.33s -> 2262.46s]  it's gone already. Oh, okay. If you kill me from all the way back there, I'll be very upset.
[2262.46s -> 2275.50s]  What the heck is wrong with you? How do I kill this? I have to run. I think idols can only be.
[2275.50s -> 2353.83s]  Oh, now what? Oh, I can't open those. How do I break it? Oh, yikes. Oh, my. Oh, my God. These
[2353.83s -> 2397.72s]  guys are protected by the idols. How do I break? Oh, I guess throwing baseballs at me. I gotta get
[2397.72s -> 2490.70s]  up there. Oh, it's so hard. Please die. No, turn into a fucking lawnmower. How do I? Oh, die.
[2490.70s -> 2525.80s]  Die. Die. Sponsored stream. You lost your mind. I didn't make it. Sorry. I'll get it right now.
[2525.80s -> 2594.18s]  It was red. Boy, I need red. Yo, yo, yo, yo. Oh, no, no. I want this thing.
[2611.16s -> 2617.40s]  Dude, there's no, there's no way. There's no way. You know what I mean? There's no way.
[2623.02s -> 2629.03s]  I already put that there. OK, so that's horse shit. So I have to just get ready.
[2629.03s -> 2678.04s]  Here we go. Ready? OK, go up here. Don't even think about it. Give me that. You piece of shit.
[2678.04s -> 2708.68s]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Slow down. Oh, yes. Thank God. All right. We're good.
[2708.84s -> 2822.22s]  I had it. Harry, Harry. There's a different mode. Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, all Paris, all Paris
[2822.22s -> 2957.02s]  and real gun. Hey, hey. Oh, what the fuck is going on here? How do I do this? What happened?
[2958.28s -> 3011.22s]  What happened? I just want to hear the rain. Can you not parry the blue? How do you? How do
[3011.22s -> 3039.43s]  you? I want to pair the blue. How do you parry blue? Use coins, use coins, use coins. Is it
[3039.75s -> 3095.43s]  coins good against them? Pretty good. Come on. Get on the barrel. Get on the barrel. Get on the
[3095.43s -> 3135.37s]  barrel. It shouldn't have been that tricky. Yeah. Why were you squished into the ground? How did I
[3135.37s -> 3189.96s]  not hit you? Oh, I missed. See ya. Now what? You play IRL like my grandpa. Sorry. That guy was
[3189.96s -> 3207.27s]  crazy. Turn the music back on. Don't fight the ferryman. I just walk by. How do you not fight
[3207.27s -> 3250.54s]  the ferryman? You could have paid him. Okay. How much is this? I'm almost at it. Should I buy it?
[3250.54s -> 3260.42s]  That wasn't even the boss boss. That was just the mini boss. I'm actually on the ship. You know,
[3260.42s -> 3268.63s]  I am so glad it was not just underwater. Thank God. This is like, I hate underwater levels. I
[3268.63s -> 3303.43s]  just do. I'm so happy that it's not that. Everybody left. Okay. I'm going to get lost here. I guarantee
[3303.43s -> 3373.08s]  it. Jerry. Jerry. What is? Where did you? I don't even know that guy spawned. You reflect triple
[3373.08s -> 3462.47s]  combo. Ready? Hyper combo. Ready? No, no, no. Get out of my face. These things suck. Just give me the
[3463.37s -> 3504.55s]  land cannon. I thought it was dead. Stop attacking. I hate these things so much. Oh my
[3504.55s -> 3516.81s]  God. Because they just so you can't, I can't like jump up, jump, jump. Nothing to grab onto.
[3548.92s -> 3557.85s]  Bounced off his skull. It bounced off of his skull. Explain that to me. I need an explanation.
[3609.82s -> 3633.58s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got juggled. Oh my God. I wish there was a double jump.
[3633.58s -> 3641.46s]  Please. I'll pay $50 for it. Make it $50 DLC. I'll buy it. Make it $50 DLC. I'll buy it tonight.
[3650.84s -> 3655.51s]  Use the hook. You can hook onto enemies. Why didn't anybody tell me that?
[3659.62s -> 3786.73s]  What? No. Where am I? Where am I? All right. Come here, you piece of shit. Die. Shut up. Do not.
[3787.29s -> 3875.70s]  Right? Yes. Being blocked. I think I'm winning. I think. This game is insane, dude. Seriously.
[3899.77s -> 4009.24s]  What do you got? Oh, you line up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Huh? Where am I?
[4009.80s -> 4050.87s]  What am I shooting at? Where is it? Oh, Jesus, dude. Where? Oh, what the fuck? You're alive?
[4050.87s -> 4086.34s]  No. Hey, extra crispy on the menu tonight. I'm sorry. We're good. Where do I go from here?
[4086.34s -> 4107.19s]  Because I need a checkpoint. Where's the checkpoint? What is this? I need a checkpoint.
[4107.19s -> 4130.38s]  Rocket launch. Direct hits cause explosions. Indirect hits will launch enemies. Does it have
[4130.38s -> 4162.46s]  another mode or no? Okay. I can hurt myself with this. Air shots. That hurts. I get up there.
[4162.94s -> 4179.38s]  Can I jump up there? I don't think so. I got it. Use the clock and then shoot it.
[4179.38s -> 4204.23s]  It's probably slow motion. I would imagine. That's cool. Ooh. You know what game was so fun?
[4204.23s -> 4235.38s]  Tribes. Tribes Ascend was so much fun. I wish I could play it. I guess I could play it, right?
[4235.38s -> 4261.83s]  What is going on? Wait, what's it doing? Bro, it's Omega gaming weekend. Just play it already.
[4261.83s -> 4304.39s]  Maybe. Maybe I'll do it. That's fun. Really cool addition. I like it a lot.
[4304.39s -> 4309.93s]  Not going to do that shit. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm not going to fall for that. Not right now.
[4317.72s -> 4415.94s]  This way? I forgot. All right. Let's go. I made it. All right. Nice. I can't believe Disney
[4415.94s -> 4426.15s]  Infinity 3.0 didn't work. I'm very upset by that. Dude, I got a pretty good idea for what's coming
[4426.15s -> 4539.72s]  up next. We'll have to see. Am I doing this right? Make it? Do I get a checkpoint? I can't buy it.
[4539.72s -> 4553.88s]  Oh, I can. That's a lot of money. What does it do? Mires an instant beam that causes a large
[4553.88s -> 4577.21s]  explosion on impact similar to a certain familiar face. Holy shit. Okay. I can't. Oh,
[4577.21s -> 4602.06s]  what's grabbed? I can't grab. Where's my grappling hook? Why can I not grab? R? No. Mouse 4. I didn't
[4602.06s -> 4629.90s]  unequip it or something, did I? Whiplash. Mouse 4. Oh, that's weird. Wow. I didn't want to do that.
[4629.90s -> 4686.68s]  Okay. What's the strategy here? I think I'm doing only cannon. I didn't hit one single fucking.
[4736.82s -> 4777.56s]  Wow. Why am I jumping into it? I thought it's a jump rope. Where did I just go?
[4781.78s -> 4790.06s]  No blood. Excuse me. What are you talking about? All right. First of all,
[4790.06s -> 4798.65s]  unequip all this stupid shit that I have on. Unequip this. Unequip this. Unequip this. Actually,
[4798.65s -> 4807.85s]  keep that. No. No. Get rid of that. Yeah. Nail gun. Keep that equipped. Just this one. Actually,
[4807.85s -> 4818.55s]  no, that's fine. All the rail cannons and the rocket launcher. Okay. I don't want all this crap.
[4821.03s -> 4837.48s]  I feel like I'm like cycling through weapons like an idiot. We're good. We're good. Good.
[4837.48s -> 4857.50s]  Everybody settle down. It's doing it again. I can parry that. Why? I thought that was the shotgun.
[4878.94s -> 4959.05s]  I need to heal. I'm in like lunge at me. What? What happened? It explodes. I tried to parry.
[4959.05s -> 5016.41s]  I didn't do it. You can only parry with the blue arm. What was wrong with that? Blue flash
[5016.41s -> 5031.00s]  means you can't parry. Oh, so why am I trying to parry? Who told me to do that? No. No blood.
[5031.00s -> 5086.71s]  No blood. None of that blood got on me. That's pretty damn good against the loliathan.
[5086.71s -> 5128.63s]  What am I doing? I'm going to stick in them. God damn it, man. Come on.
[5150.74s -> 5246.62s]  I can parry the bullets, but that doesn't really help though. Huh? Where's the tail? Where's the
[5246.62s -> 5279.50s]  tail? Is it dead? Oh, that was crazy. Damn. Damn. That was crazy. Crazy. Damn. That was crazy.
[5279.50s -> 5292.82s]  That's it, buddy. You're going in the drink. Voice actor? What do you mean I'm going in the
[5292.82s -> 5299.38s]  drink? What does that mean? I don't want to go in the drink. How do I get out of here?
[5299.38s -> 5340.09s]  I need more than that. Under 10 seconds. I'm at 6-1. Should I be concerned? You know what I'm saying?
[5340.09s -> 5384.10s]  Cry for the weeper. Oh my God. I'm about to... I'm going to put the game on easy. Holy smokes.
[5384.10s -> 5489.66s]  I got one. What the fuck? Oh. Holy shit. Got someone. This song goes hard. Is there even a
[5489.66s -> 5520.47s]  song playing? Oh, do I have to write these? Okay, so now where do I go? This area is terrifying.
[5520.47s -> 5553.90s]  Yikes. What? Just die. Kill me. Just kill me. What happened? Did I die? I don't understand.
[5553.90s -> 5609.96s]  I don't know what happened. I guess I did it. Where's the place to put this? Stop it. Wait,
[5609.96s -> 5621.88s]  why am I locked out? Turn on the music? Music on. How come I can't get in here? I'm missing
[5621.88s -> 5657.75s]  something here. Can I put it down? What did I do? This is the beginning of the game. You
[5657.75s -> 5667.80s]  accidentally do a speedrun strategy and you softlock the game. Wait, that sucks. If I re...
[5667.80s -> 5714.02s]  Oh, shit. It's not that far. There it is. Oh, come on. Carry the shotgun bullets. That's right. I
[5714.02s -> 5730.98s]  forgot. All right. The weapon combination that I have is really stupid, so I can't do it.
[5730.98s -> 5741.38s]  I physically can't press the buttons because that's left click and middle mouse at the same time.
[5741.38s -> 5746.79s]  So this is going to be hard to do. All right. Let's try this again, please.
[5747.51s -> 5765.48s]  I guess I can do it. It's hard to do because I accidentally scroll the wheel. It still says
[5765.48s -> 5775.64s]  Disney Infinity 3.0. Does it really? Are you serious? No, it doesn't. Come on. Don't do that
[5775.64s -> 5860.20s]  to me right now. Where are you? It's doable. All right. Now what games we've played so far.
[5860.20s -> 5901.80s]  We played Disney Infinity 3.0. That's it. Ow. Okay. Let's try this again and not screw it up.
[5909.06s -> 5924.42s]  Okay. Here we go. So now I put this on the thing, right? What do I do? What do I take this?
[5927.02s -> 5932.94s]  When you say go right, you have to understand that when I read go right, I don't know if I'm
[5932.94s -> 5994.94s]  in the orientation. Downstairs. Music up. Okay. I'll do music up. What's this? Okay. What's that?
[5995.58s -> 6002.42s]  Okay. Start it. Start the encounter. How do I start the encounter? How do I start the encounter?
[6004.98s -> 6011.11s]  How do I start the... Just die. Just die. Just die. Just die. It's a waste.
[6040.79s -> 6162.30s]  Geez. I didn't have enough things. You piece of shit. Just die. Oh my goodness. It's so many
[6162.30s -> 6243.58s]  things on the screen. Delete that weapon. Come on. Respawn the things. All right. Don't give me this
[6243.58s -> 6287.51s]  shit. Oh, where? Oh my God. I didn't... I don't want this weapon.
[6298.25s -> 6308.18s]  Oh, what's that? Let me do it.
[6353.70s -> 6357.70s]  This is like the moment of impact of a car accident. You know what I mean? This is like
[6358.42s -> 6363.08s]  the moment of impact on a car accident. Just times a thousand. You know what I mean?
[6366.73s -> 6420.38s]  Just like... Ready? Go. Give me the doubles. Give me the doubles. Come on. This is it.
[6421.10s -> 6515.11s]  What's up? What happened? Don't you dare step back up. Hey. A checkpoint. I got to get a
[6515.11s -> 6525.64s]  checkpoint. Is there a checkpoint in here? Where's there a checkpoint? I need a checkpoint right now.
[6526.28s -> 6540.42s]  Is there a checkpoint anywhere? How are you still firing at me? Dude, you shouldn't be able to do
[6540.42s -> 6593.90s]  that. Thank God. I need a checkpoint. Come on, dude. What is going on here?
[6608.95s -> 6612.07s]  I'm doing a lot of screaming. I'm sorry. People are probably like annoyed by this by now.
[6618.94s -> 6681.13s]  Come to me. Okay. What? Get a jump? Oh, shit. What the fuck? Dude, I don't know where to go.
[6681.13s -> 6754.34s]  I'm tethered to that person. I don't... Why is it blocking that shit? Oh, no way. Dude. I'm going to
[6754.34s -> 6822.63s]  watch the YouTube videos. I'm going to be eating this. Stop that. It's fucking cheating. Oh my
[6822.63s -> 6911.18s]  fucking God. Oh, no. Please don't do it. Why does it explode so much in my face?
[6911.18s -> 6914.38s]  Please.
[6922.79s -> 6984.25s]  Is anybody alive? Who's alive? Who is alive? There's nobody left alive. Shoot a coin. That
[6984.25s -> 7028.54s]  guy's dead. Oh my... Oh, my heart hurts. I thought I died. I thought... Did I die? Oh my God. I thought
[7028.54s -> 7039.19s]  I went in the fucking lava and died. I was supposed to say no way. No fucking way. Oh my God. Wow.
[7039.19s -> 7047.14s]  Wow. Wow. Wow. I thought it was instant kill. Oh my God. Get me out of here. Oh my God, guys.
[7048.22s -> 7059.72s]  No fucking way. And this is 6-2 now. That's not even the end. I got to fight the boss.
[7060.44s -> 7073.94s]  I'll turn it up for the final encounter.
[7093.02s -> 7101.50s]  You've taken everything from the machine and now all the means is perfect hatred.
[7106.90s -> 7150.23s]  Anakin, don't. Keep running for yourself. Is this where the Gugget is coming?
[7150.23s -> 7175.82s]  Is this where the Gugget is coming? Yeah? All right, let's go. I'm not giving you a second.
[7178.14s -> 7185.02s]  Break you apart. Splay the gore of your protein form across the stars. I will grind you down until
[7185.02s -> 7191.98s]  the very spot you fly for mercy. My hands shall relish, ending you here and now.
[7203.64s -> 7270.68s]  My God. I can't block. Oh. Jesus. No way. You can't be serious. This is so hard. This is so
[7270.68s -> 7336.09s]  goddamn hard. What the fuck? Oh my goodness. Oh my God. Why am I getting that close?
[7374.26s -> 7504.20s]  Shit. OK. You piece of shit. Oh my God. Damn it.
[7504.84s -> 7659.85s]  No. What is going on? I panicked. This is so fucking ridiculous. Hey, it's this
[7659.85s -> 7665.85s]  Omega gaming weekend, man. I got to play some more stuff. This is a fucking sick game and yeah.
[7713.26s -> 7722.65s]  It's way too hard. It's just way too hard. It's way too hard. It's just too hard. It's just too
[7722.65s -> 7726.73s]  hard. It's not going to happen. It's impossible. It's just it's like an unbeatable encounter where
[7726.73s -> 7745.11s]  it's like you can't fucking do it or whatever. Get this stupid fucking thing off. This thing
[7745.11s -> 7788.34s]  just hurts you. It's awful. Is this? Show me what you were made for.
[7796.78s -> 7853.54s]  Just kill me. It's over. It's over. Just kill me. Kill me. He killed me in one hit.
[7854.18s -> 7965.61s]  Oh, god damn it. He moves so fast. It's just like I parried it. Shoot him. When he teleports behind
[7965.61s -> 7970.52s]  you, it's not even fair. That should remake the game. They should redo the whole game. Make the
[7970.52s -> 7981.85s]  whole thing from scratch. The whole thing from scratch again. Is there a reason why it's OK?
[7982.81s -> 7993.61s]  This is a problem. Changing my weapons as mouse scroll is fucking ruining everything
[7993.69s -> 8005.93s]  because melee is mouse scroll click. So I'm like, I'm this boss is just OK. You want to play this
[8005.93s -> 8013.69s]  game? All I feel like I'm doing is just putting my head just underwater and just screaming
[8013.69s -> 8020.31s]  underwater and then lifting my head up. I feel like I'm just yelling underwater. I'm just going like
[8020.71s -> 8045.99s]  That's all. This is it. That's the whole thing I'm doing. What do I want to change it to?
[8133.48s -> 8143.03s]  You want to give it a try? If you think it's so funny, then come try it.
[8145.64s -> 8153.35s]  Dave. We're sitting in the back. All of you. You too. Greg. Fuck you, Greg.
[8154.79s -> 8159.43s]  I do a live show. I do a live video game show and only five people show up.
[8170.47s -> 8211.98s]  I don't know what fucking time zone I'm in. When does he do the ding? When the fuck is the goddamn
[8211.98s -> 8216.46s]  thing? When's the ding? He wins the ding. He's not going to do a ding now. All of a sudden,
[8217.10s -> 8244.71s]  I don't feel like doing a ding anymore. Is that what I'm understanding? Where'd he go?
[8247.77s -> 8254.17s]  Um, usually I want the devs to look at this. Usually he comes down and there's like a few
[8254.17s -> 8259.77s]  seconds. I want the devs to take a look at that. I want the devs to take a look at that one.
[8262.04s -> 8289.83s]  Something might have been wrong with that. I parried it. I'm not playing this game anymore.
[8289.91s -> 8346.22s]  I'm done. Dude, I can't even tell. Get the shotgun. I don't want to. Wrong arm. Well,
[8346.22s -> 8433.19s]  why is it doing that? I don't understand. You. Okay. That's my time. That's my time.
[8433.19s -> 8436.84s]  That's my time. That's my time. I need to do it.
[8436.84s -> 8458.65s]  I'm the taste of victory. Yeah. This tastes. Is this my blood?
[8460.25s -> 8471.21s]  I've never known such a relief. I need some time to think. We will meet again, machine.
[8471.21s -> 8531.38s]  55 restarts holy shit into the ceiling how does that work is it gonna be is
[8531.38s -> 8547.35s]  there enough more to act to later or is there more to act to there's a lot you
[8547.35s -> 8562.36s]  missed so is the game feature complete at this point I guess I could just read
[8562.36s -> 8572.40s]  the ending cutscene is that okay I beat the thing and I'm asking you it's
[8572.40s -> 8578.23s]  answering the question right now it's like guys so can you guys anybody tell
[8578.23s -> 8580.79s]  me if there's something that's on the screen as can you tell me what happens
[8580.79s -> 8644.62s]  at the end okay let me read this pieces never fit because your light is sword
[8644.62s -> 8707.84s]  and fire wait what this is me I'm reading I'm not pretending how to read
[8707.84s -> 8755.34s]  I know how to just I'm just taking it in it's funny when I try to look up where
[8755.34s -> 8774.08s]  you are is right there next to the camera so just hurts so Gabriel comes
[8774.08s -> 8778.16s]  and kills the council and they're like don't why are you doing this and he's
[8778.16s -> 8832.29s]  fighting for hurts am crazy I genuinely did not I just wanted to get to that
[8832.29s -> 8842.04s]  next forever okay now it's time for the part of the stream where I go full cam
[8842.04s -> 8853.83s]  and pretend like I'm doing a movie watch along like Amazon Prime or something you
[8853.83s -> 8857.29s]  know if you find it funny if I just set that full screen and pretend like I'm
[8857.29s -> 8871.37s]  reacting to a movie that's not here well actually you know what let's save this
[8871.37s -> 8878.98s]  let's save this let's I want to start with this tomorrow I'm not the stream
[8878.98s -> 8883.50s]  still going but I want to like get popcorn and shit and snacks and pretend
[8883.50s -> 8887.90s]  like full cam I'm watching a movie and it's like oh yeah you can for legal
[8887.90s -> 8890.58s]  reasons I can't put it on the stream but it's like you can queue it up with me
[8890.58s -> 8899.44s]  and I'm gonna I'll do it I'll do it for like fucking 30 straight minutes what
[8899.44s -> 8901.96s]  movie should it be and I'm just pretending to react to stuff that
[8901.96s -> 8916.58s]  happens in it that's gonna be so hard jaws to the Incredibles I actually have
[8916.58s -> 8921.40s]  no I've never seen the incredible start to finish I have no idea what happens
[8921.40s -> 8925.65s]  and then if you actually took that and like cute it up with the movie that I
[8925.65s -> 8932.25s]  said it was it might be actually kind of a funny watch along I've never seen the
[8932.25s -> 8936.19s]  incredible start to finish all right that was cool that was a very hard that
[8936.19s -> 8942.05s]  was awful in a good way I don't mean the game awful I mean it was just very hard
[8942.05s -> 8947.62s]  and very terrifying and very scary now we're gonna we're gonna wind down a
[8947.62s -> 8952.29s]  little we're gonna pull it down just a little bit because we're gonna play
[8952.29s -> 8972.00s]  hamster playground now I think very cool
