[2.87s -> 13.14s]  Hey, what's up? Sorry, I'm a little late. I had to do my get ready thing I do in front of the mirror that all streamers do.
[13.14s -> 23.67s]  If you don't know, after you get out of the shower and after you do your hair and you get some to eat, you have some water.
[23.67s -> 29.21s]  I, like many others, go in front of the mirror and just point at myself and I go,
[29.21s -> 37.24s]  own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it for about 25 minutes. Really get myself pumped up for the day.
[46.46s -> 68.98s]  That would get in the way so much if you really had to do that. Just sitting there yelling,
[68.98s -> 76.07s]  own it to yourself in the mirror. But anyways, hi, how are you? Today we're going to play a game
[76.79s -> 86.87s]  about traveling through time. The game is called No Time. It's a game about driving around in a car.
[87.85s -> 94.57s]  That car has time travel capabilities. It is a car game. Just to let you know, this is a car game.
[95.29s -> 113.35s]  Could be very fun. Travel back to an hour ago when you weren't late. I think you can, I'm, all right.
[113.35s -> 119.11s]  From the description of this game, I think you can put in any date in modern human history.
[120.46s -> 132.62s]  As long as it's 1 AD. So I, maybe we can go forward. Go back to 23 years ago. Oh no.
[138.18s -> 149.27s]  The title sucks. It doesn't matter. You guys are still doing the 20, yeah.
[150.98s -> 157.77s]  You still on the 23 thing. I have a question. How many of you guys watched the movie yesterday?
[159.48s -> 164.04s]  You guys have had one full day in between the last stream. Anybody watch the movie?
[164.04s -> 178.22s]  I have to assume some of you have. Why would I do that? I don't know. I thought about it. I was
[178.22s -> 183.18s]  pretty close to, you know, is it on, can I get it on like Amazon or like iTunes or something?
[183.74s -> 196.52s]  What does this person say? I don't know. Whatever it was that got removed. I think they're asking
[196.52s -> 203.86s]  what the best VR headset is. It depends. Do you want to save some money to get one of the small
[203.86s -> 208.18s]  wireless ones? You know, or do you want to have the wire going into the back of your head and then,
[208.18s -> 214.97s]  yeah, I don't know. Have the index. I would say the index. The only problem is my index was kind
[214.97s -> 221.27s]  of screwed up. My left ear of my index just kind of stopped working randomly. So I don't know. I
[221.27s -> 236.34s]  don't think I can say that. Can't wait for 2023. How do we, how do we end that joke? Do you know
[236.34s -> 241.70s]  how unbearable 2023 is going to be on this channel? If we don't end that joke, we have to find an
[241.70s -> 257.50s]  exit for it. I can't wait till 2025. We got to come up with a new thing. We got to give you guys a
[257.50s -> 267.56s]  new number because otherwise next year is going to be hell. All right. You guys ready? Let's go. It
[267.56s -> 273.00s]  took me long enough. I do have to say this. I know a lot of people are going to, they're going to
[273.00s -> 280.04s]  pog sad in the chat when they hear this, but after this stream, streams are going to be a little
[280.04s -> 287.06s]  sporadic over the next couple of weeks. I've got a lot, I've got a lot of work to do. I've got a
[287.06s -> 293.75s]  lot of work to do, but seriously, I'm not going to be streaming this weekend. I'm not going to be
[293.75s -> 298.52s]  streaming. They're going to be all over the place. The green screen will happen in the next week.
[299.16s -> 313.86s]  I'm going to give you a hard date very soon within the next 10 days, but that June into July is
[313.86s -> 316.34s]  going to, it's probably something, it's probably going to be the busiest I've been
[317.22s -> 325.45s]  since 2021, a few months, two or three months before the dollhouse. There's a lot of stuff
[325.45s -> 332.89s]  going on. So don't worry. I'm not going, you'll see me. I'm not going away. I'm going to try to do
[332.89s -> 345.02s]  one or two streams a week until July, at least. So don't worry. I'm not going anywhere. What
[345.02s -> 352.81s]  happened? I was playing fallout. The streams are going to be sporadic. That's it, but not too,
[352.81s -> 360.74s]  don't worry. It's not like I'm going to stream for like, don't worry. Since 2022, all through 2021,
[360.74s -> 366.89s]  I was kind of a once a week Andy. That's probably not going to happen. So don't worry. It's not like
[366.89s -> 373.50s]  I'm going to go to once a week in the next month. Don't worry about that. They already are once a
[373.50s -> 379.50s]  week. No, no, I do like, I do like two or three times a week. I stream three times a week since
[379.50s -> 396.42s]  2022. I went back to the old pre Vegas schedule three times a week or so. I actually, the pre,
[396.42s -> 400.18s]  the first like year in Vegas, wasn't I streaming like four plus days a week?
[402.78s -> 414.66s]  You should stream two, oh, come on. Stop, stop it. Two to 23. Oh my God. I'm going to give you
[414.66s -> 423.00s]  another number. Six. Six. Isn't that number six? Cool. There's so many things that you can add up
[423.00s -> 433.37s]  to make six. Two plus two plus two is six. Seven minus one is six. Six times zero is zero. But
[434.55s -> 438.87s]  six, six, six, that's the devil number. Isn't that a, that's a crazy number, isn't it? That's
[438.87s -> 444.36s]  a scary number. You know what number I really don't like? The number six. Cause like six, six,
[444.60s -> 450.58s]  that's devil. I'm scared of the devil. No, don't meme that one. Don't, don't meme that one. Don't
[450.58s -> 466.46s]  do that. No, I fucking hate that. Did it work? All right, let's go. How you doing? What's up?
[466.46s -> 479.27s]  Uh, this is no time. Is it my camera? Just making sure. Nice evil hair. Yeah, it's all right.
[481.03s -> 489.78s]  All right, let's get it up. See what would have been really funny is if I had been in a back to
[489.78s -> 496.74s]  the future costume with goggles and a big lab coat. And before I turned the stream on my webcam,
[496.74s -> 501.78s]  I was like, Oh, here we go. And, Oh, we're going to go for it. We're going to find a future. We're
[501.78s -> 505.38s]  going to go back to the future. And it was, I was in a back to the future costume and that would be
[505.38s -> 513.40s]  funny. I think you guys would like that. All right, let's go. This is a driving game. Is this a
[513.40s -> 530.30s]  controller game? This is a car game. Maybe I should use a controller. Thanks for your disappointment.
[530.30s -> 535.45s]  That would be Richard Nixon. That was not, that was not Richard Nixon. I can't, you can't do.
[536.01s -> 541.82s]  All right, listen, this is important for all of you watching at home. If I do a doc impression,
[541.82s -> 546.84s]  I'm doing a Rick impression. And you all hate that. I, nobody can ever do a doc impression ever
[546.84s -> 552.63s]  again. Cause you're just doing Rick from Rick and Morty. You understand? Like I would have tried to
[552.63s -> 557.77s]  go into it and really do it, but it would have been, uh, it would have been Rick. Let me try to
[557.77s -> 564.41s]  do a doc. Oh, Morty, we're going to be careful. Put that, get back in there and we're going to
[564.41s -> 575.96s]  go back in time to shave. Actually it is different. Morty, Morty, we gotta be careful. I don't know.
[576.52s -> 579.96s]  Guys, I've never seen all these movies. I've never seen them. I just know, I know Christopher,
[579.96s -> 588.68s]  Christopher Lloyd, right? His name's Morty, not Marty. Marty, not what? I just dropped everything.
[588.68s -> 595.14s]  All right. Stop. Let's go. All right. Let's play the core game. Play the official story
[595.14s -> 602.87s]  campaign of no time along with all side stories and secrets. Sure. Why not? You guys ready? Can
[602.87s -> 613.59s]  I drive? Sir Adam, the energy source of the future requires a fusion reactor. I gotta put my headphones
[613.59s -> 624.34s]  in to understand. PLC entry. Hello and welcome to no time. A lost in days experience. If you've got
[624.34s -> 629.14s]  a minute, I'd like to take you through the basics of the game. Why is there crash dummy stuff on
[629.14s -> 634.36s]  there? All right. Let's go tutorial. Double the, double the, double the, double the, double the
[634.36s -> 643.06s]  W A S D. Pretty good. And left alts to crouch. Is there a punch? Left alt is crouch. That's changing.
[648.46s -> 658.42s]  It actually got to come down to like 30. Crouch is left alt. We're going to make that C is compass.
[659.70s -> 668.39s]  Use is F. When did this change? Use was E for 50 years and they just, everybody collectively all
[668.39s -> 679.22s]  decided it was going to be F. Why? Please help me with this. What happened? E, E, E was for everything.
[679.22s -> 685.38s]  It was for use. It was for interaction. Now it's F. What everyone collectively at the same time said
[685.38s -> 691.78s]  that was a good idea. I don't, why? There has to be a reason, right? Because Q and E is for leaning.
[691.78s -> 695.61s]  Oh, that, whatever. That's all right. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to make this what I want.
[695.69s -> 706.36s]  So it's going to be E. Take is going to be F. Sandbox, that's fine. Full power mode G. Zoom,
[706.36s -> 710.84s]  X. Punch. There is punch. Holy shit. Okay. There's a throw. This game's already pretty much a nine
[710.84s -> 722.26s]  out of 10 so far. Crouch is going to be C. Compass is going to be control or tab. No, compass. Compass.
[722.26s -> 728.65s]  I don't know. Two, four. Compass is going to be four. I don't know why. Cause it's like four
[728.65s -> 734.60s]  directions. North, south, east, west. That makes sense to me. Zoom. That's fine. All right. I think
[734.60s -> 742.62s]  this is good. If I need to change it again. Car. W A S D. Space. Fly mode. Thrust up. Up arrow.
[742.62s -> 748.10s]  Time conductor. Cooling. Okay. What about ride? All right. I think we're good.
[748.10s -> 756.78s]  Pick up the uranium next to the car. Press E to pick it up. Uranium. Did you say E? Wait, what?
[758.20s -> 763.13s]  Now put the uranium onto the reactor. Didn't I say, wait, didn't I say E?
[766.76s -> 772.79s]  He said E. What's going on? Am I going crazy? No, seriously. I'm going crazy.
[772.79s -> 784.73s]  After just saying that. What's going on? What? Oh, it is F. Okay. All right. Put the uranium
[784.73s -> 788.09s]  on top of the reactor chamber. Use number one to seven to scroll through your inventory
[788.09s -> 807.69s]  or mouse wheel. All right. So put it in. What? What? Okay. I have to eventually come back to 1984
[809.32s -> 818.81s]  day two at 000. Turn the volume up. I will. Okay. Now read the useful notes.
[819.53s -> 830.26s]  They should be on the front of your car. Oh, that's loud for me. All right. Useful notes.
[838.41s -> 842.57s]  Like fucking Jesus. Why can't I just, I want to grab it. Can I grab it? After you finish reading
[842.57s -> 847.45s]  the notes into the vehicle by using the steering wheel. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm on step.
[847.45s -> 854.02s]  What step am I on? Step one. Insert uranium sample into reaction. Okay. Step two. Get in the car.
[857.03s -> 864.25s]  We got one lamp in the test zone. Step three. Check the reactor temperature. All right. We've
[864.25s -> 883.45s]  got to get in the car. It's fucking dark in here. No, I need those notes. I don't know what to do.
[883.45s -> 891.46s]  And you can save and the game above. Oh, and if your reactor temperature is above 300 degrees
[891.46s -> 900.57s]  Fahrenheit first. Okay. Cool. The nuclear. Oh, and you can look up the controls in the pause menu.
[900.57s -> 904.01s]  All right. So we can't go over 300 degrees. I have talked for long enough.
[904.01s -> 909.93s]  Good luck and have fun on your adventures in no time. Lost a day sandbox experience.
[909.93s -> 922.31s]  All right. Let's go. Drive. How do I drive? I need those notes. How do I get out of the car?
[922.31s -> 933.37s]  I need the notes that are on the top. Find an advanced source of energy for the reactor.
[933.37s -> 940.52s]  Estimations would be around 2014. I think or a little later. Okay. Uranium samples as temporary
[940.52s -> 945.61s]  power source are in the luggage space. Do not travel through time if the reactor is
[946.25s -> 955.51s]  temperature is above 300 degrees. Avoid yourself at all costs. Okay. I repeat. Avoid yourself.
[955.51s -> 963.02s]  What about the actual useful notes? Give me this. Step five. Talk with the time conduction and
[963.02s -> 972.55s]  enter the date into the timetable that order. All right. Step six. The travel sequence should start.
[972.55s -> 975.43s]  That's month, day, year, and then hmm. What is hmm?
[977.56s -> 982.76s]  Travel sequence should start at about 70 miles per hour. Okay, let's go.
[983.56s -> 996.44s]  Get in the fucking car. All right. Here we go. Let's time to set our destination.
[996.44s -> 1009.67s]  We are going to go to type a date and time. Um, I don't, what am I pressing? Date a 12.
[1014.71s -> 1031.88s]  What did I just do? Type a date and confirm. I just shot me. What? What? I just explode.
[1031.96s -> 1037.48s]  I don't understand. What just happened? Why am I like fucking three feet tall?
[1038.79s -> 1057.26s]  What a terrible nightmare. Hello. Open up. Hello. Shut this off. What? What happened?
[1060.87s -> 1076.92s]  Oh, that's me doing that. Turn it down. Hello. Who is it? Finally. Have you been sleeping on
[1076.92s -> 1088.10s]  the floor again? You better had made some progress by now ever. But tell me you finished the reactor.
[1088.10s -> 1093.06s]  I did, but awesome. Come on now. There's a little, there's a little time. Our supervisor will show
[1093.06s -> 1100.98s]  up soon. We need the machine to be ready. Holy shit. This guy, the time machine. Come on now.
[1100.98s -> 1113.70s]  We got no time. All right. Grab the reactor and follow me to the elevator. All right. This is a
[1113.78s -> 1128.04s]  reactor. Drink that coffee. A stack of books. That's a reactor. Give it to me. Let's go.
[1135.67s -> 1144.02s]  Put your hand in the door. I dropped the reactor. Put your hand in the door. All right. Let's go.
[1144.02s -> 1151.18s]  Where are we going? I'm holding the reactor. You press the button to go to the lobby for the,
[1151.18s -> 1156.62s]  oh, give me a break. Why would I have to do this? I'm holding a fucking nuclear reactor or whatever
[1156.62s -> 1166.87s]  this is. I'll do it. I'm sorry. If somebody has one of these, they go and let this and they're
[1166.87s -> 1171.90s]  going to be a person in front, a person to each side and a person behind walking with them,
[1171.90s -> 1177.77s]  all moving step by step at the same time. And there's going to be somebody literally,
[1177.77s -> 1181.77s]  there's going to be something attached to their stomach, like a big umbrella underneath them.
[1181.77s -> 1186.17s]  So like if they drop it, it just goes right into like the big chute, like under like an umbrella.
[1186.17s -> 1190.39s]  There's no way somebody's holding it in their hands like this. All right. This is the,
[1192.20s -> 1204.26s]  this is it. Quest turn in. Edward looks proud. Wow. Mach three. Yep. I modified it to reach
[1204.26s -> 1209.45s]  speeds of up to 90 miles per hour and to also give you a nice clean shape, cleaner than a
[1209.45s -> 1216.41s]  single blade. Let's hope it will last longer than the Mach two. I heard that C Corp is working on
[1216.41s -> 1223.50s]  nuclear fueled cars. We're going to beat them to it. Oh, stop. Let's assemble the rest of the car
[1223.50s -> 1227.42s]  first. Hope your reactor works. Open the reactor hatch and insert it in the front of the car. All
[1227.42s -> 1248.76s]  right, let's go. Let's do it. Oh, got it. You didn't say I had to open the first car we had.
[1248.76s -> 1254.01s]  We didn't have to do that. All right. Now the time core is what makes time travel possible.
[1254.01s -> 1262.18s]  It converts a frequency of time stream into an actual date and time. Where the fuck did you go?
[1262.18s -> 1269.88s]  How do I close this? Presently, you can only compute the dates in between roughly 4,000 BC
[1269.88s -> 1275.56s]  and 2030. But I'll figure out a way to mend it. The time frequency just oscillates. Though currently
[1275.56s -> 1286.52s]  you can only input dates after one AD anyway. Okay. All right. So what's the deal? He sounds
[1286.52s -> 1299.86s]  like Peter Griffin. Let's do a test run. Oh, fucking come on. I know, I know. I promise the
[1299.86s -> 1306.58s]  time displacement procedure will occur this time, even if you crash the car into the wall. I've had
[1306.58s -> 1311.78s]  nightmares ever since. I'm lucky to be alive. Or maybe the rest of the island, the accelerator
[1311.78s -> 1317.62s]  could have gotten destroyed in a nuclear blast due to the impact. Don't worry. I made the car
[1317.70s -> 1323.46s]  very sturdy. So the probability of a nuclear explosion. Yes, but first retrieve the personal
[1323.46s -> 1333.37s]  log computer, please. They're on the table. Yeah, it's like if Peter Griffin was an undertale.
[1333.37s -> 1351.98s]  I know what you mean. All right. Dress in the hazmat suit. Should I be in this? What is this
[1351.98s -> 1369.13s]  thing? What am I looking at here? Okay, I got it. Oh, no. What do you want me to do? Did you say
[1369.13s -> 1379.10s]  there was notes or something? What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? You say there
[1379.10s -> 1386.22s]  was something on the table? This is what it was on the table? What do you want me to do?
[1387.03s -> 1401.91s]  I don't remember. What do you want me to do? A computer. Okay, thanks. It's the the Pip Boy.
[1403.61s -> 1411.11s]  Okay. Prologue. Edward gave me his newest PLC, a few bug fixes, and so on. Let's talk to Edward.
[1411.11s -> 1420.76s]  Oh, this music. Isn't it great? It works. Made a few bug fixes and cleanups. Hope it'll help
[1420.76s -> 1430.31s]  you with your work in the future. Looking cool. Thanks, Ed. This game is random. Can you strap it
[1430.39s -> 1434.55s]  on my arm? This thing weighs like three kilos. I don't think you want that kind of strain on
[1434.55s -> 1441.66s]  your wrist. Anyways, you see I'm strapped. I'm not suffocating, right? Am I just suffocating in a suit?
[1442.78s -> 1449.96s]  Okay, what do you want me to do? I've strapped a meter on the right side of the PLC. It tells
[1449.96s -> 1456.38s]  you whenever a temporal shift occurs. Remember our little theory session? This shift happens
[1456.38s -> 1461.66s]  when your activity in space time reaches a certain threshold. Time itself morphs around your actions,
[1461.66s -> 1466.78s]  wiping your past selves, since you or anything you left in that time weren't meant to be there.
[1467.83s -> 1482.70s]  Oh, of course. It's the grandpa paradox. I think. The grandpa paradox is if you go back in time
[1483.50s -> 1488.70s]  before you were born, you technically weren't born, so therefore your grandfather had to have
[1488.70s -> 1492.14s]  been alive first for you to be alive, so therefore you can't exist in that time frame. Let's go to
[1492.14s -> 1503.24s]  the grandpa paradox. It's something like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's if you go back
[1503.24s -> 1510.42s]  in time and kill your grandfather, then you can't exist, so you disappear and you fade out,
[1510.42s -> 1528.14s]  like in the movies. Why would you do that? I don't know. Oh, yeah, I got a time machine.
[1528.14s -> 1532.94s]  The first thing I'm going to do. Oh, man, I could go see anything in human history. I could go
[1532.94s -> 1536.54s]  forward. I could see what the world looks like. I could see what happened back when the dinosaurs.
[1536.54s -> 1542.82s]  No, I think I was going to go kill my grandfather and disappear. What? Well, yeah, why would I do
[1542.82s -> 1568.23s]  that? Why would I do that? That's a Chad move. No, it's not. Okay. Giga Chad goes back in time
[1568.23s -> 1577.66s]  to kill his grandfather. If you drop something sometime in the past, it would vanish. This is
[1577.66s -> 1582.46s]  the grandpa paradox, right? Bigger changes would probably... Oh, no, the grandpa paradox is if you
[1582.46s -> 1588.22s]  go swat a mosquito on your arm, then your grandfather never meets your grandmother because
[1588.22s -> 1594.70s]  everything can change, possibly. And then when you go forward in time, you look out the window
[1594.70s -> 1600.14s]  and it's raining donuts and you wish you would have stayed in that timeline, but you got really
[1600.14s -> 1603.42s]  freaked out. It's something that happened at the family dinner table, so you left before it started
[1603.42s -> 1613.35s]  raining the donuts. I understand. I understand. It's a fucking Simpsons episode. You say I'm the
[1613.35s -> 1617.75s]  one that's not a cultured media viewer. That happened in The Simpsons and all you question
[1617.75s -> 1621.35s]  marking me and everyone says Simpsons is the best fucking TV show ever made. And that was back when
[1621.35s -> 1626.71s]  The Simpsons were in the first 10 years of its existence, not the last 20 years of its existence.
[1627.27s -> 1632.39s]  To me, the last 20 years of The Simpsons existence has been like an iPad ad for like a mobile game
[1632.39s -> 1637.75s]  from like trailer. That's the same thing for me. The last like 10 to 15 years of The Simpsons
[1637.75s -> 1643.72s]  has been like an iPad trailer. I just like, I skip it. I don't want to watch this. What were we
[1643.72s -> 1650.60s]  doing? I don't know. Leave me alone. I'm fucking relaxing. You need to fix the fragmentation. I'm
[1650.60s -> 1656.70s]  just sitting here like breathing in my own like carbon dioxide. What's? All right. I said I was
[1656.70s -> 1661.74s]  going to chill out today and that's happening. So stop fucking saying the number 23 or you're
[1661.74s -> 1668.70s]  going to be fucking banned. Back to it. You need to fix the fragmentation of time for me.
[1670.92s -> 1675.40s]  So during some tests of the core, I ended up making rifts in the time space continuum. I sent
[1675.40s -> 1680.20s]  boxes with items through time, but they came back empty with strange letters inside them.
[1680.20s -> 1687.13s]  Just keep that in mind. Don't lose sight of your boxes while time traveling. I should make a box
[1687.85s -> 1693.53s]  that's a mailbox and like I put it in one place and if you put stuff into it, it goes back and
[1693.53s -> 1697.93s]  forward in time. And then I could have a pen pal who communicate with somebody from a different
[1697.93s -> 1714.30s]  time period. That'd be cool. Somebody said play the fucking game. I had to be honest. I'm very
[1714.30s -> 1721.74s]  confused. I am playing the game. This is a lot of dialogue. Okay, let's go. No time for that.
[1721.74s -> 1725.66s]  Drive the car into the acceleration tunnel. Move the car to the starting position. Then wait for
[1725.66s -> 1729.66s]  my signal. When I open the gates, the mod chip, which I inserted earlier, will send you exactly
[1729.66s -> 1734.46s]  one hour into the future. Make sure to remove the chip afterwards. It blocks the time input. Okay.
[1734.46s -> 1753.30s]  Okay. All right. Let's go. Yeah. One. Why one hour? Okay. So he said it already.
[1753.30s -> 1761.77s]  Did you set it already? Did you turn it on?
[1780.58s -> 1789.78s]  Save the game. All right. That's good. Save it right here. The save system's not turning on.
[1790.42s -> 1815.00s]  Can I help you? All right. Let's go. Turn it on. Is it on? Okay. Here we go. Oh fuck.
[1815.00s -> 1822.42s]  You need to put the uranium in. Didn't I already do that? It's in it. It's right there.
[1823.14s -> 1836.36s]  Didn't I already do that? I already did that, didn't I? Oh, it's okay. I didn't know it was
[1836.36s -> 1847.21s]  the second thing. All right. Let's go. Here we go. So get to the starting point, which is where we're
[1847.21s -> 1865.80s]  here. I'm imagining this is probably the starting point. You're going to open the door. All right.
[1865.80s -> 1876.09s]  Let's go. Everything seems to be active. Activate them. I think they're active. Reactor. On.
[1878.46s -> 1894.07s]  Accelerate to 70 miles per hour. Time conductor. On. Get ready. Let's go.
[1894.31s -> 1922.89s]  Oh, I suspect located. You're coming with us. I got one. I got one. What do we do?
[1923.61s -> 1931.02s]  Drive the car down the secret door. I can't fucking see anything with this stupid suit on.
[1935.19s -> 1942.18s]  You just skipped over that hour and here you are. Incredible. Are you all right? Like,
[1942.18s -> 1946.02s]  do you feel weird in any way? Don't worry about the guys back there. I'll be explained in due time.
[1946.02s -> 1951.46s]  Do you want a gun? What is this place? Yes. My personal invention. A stun gun to be precise.
[1951.46s -> 1958.04s]  The first prototype that works. Open this place. This is my secret hideout. I installed a secret
[1958.04s -> 1965.18s]  door, entrance and so on. I knew it would come in handy someday. Is it even legal? I don't know.
[1965.74s -> 1972.92s]  What's going on here? Do you want the short version or the long version? Whatever. Agents,
[1972.92s -> 1977.16s]  they broke into the facility and are raiding all our research. We need to get the machine out of
[1977.16s -> 1983.11s]  here. They call them that on the news. C Corp has made no comments on whether they got attacked too.
[1983.75s -> 1989.91s]  How do we get the machine out unnoticed? Unnoticed? Not possible. I know how to give
[1989.91s -> 1993.91s]  you enough time before they catch up though. This room leads to the drainage tunnels of the facility.
[1993.91s -> 1999.59s]  From there you can move on the main road which leads to Pine Island. Just go as far away as
[1999.59s -> 2004.55s]  possible. Jump some time into the future just till things cool off. We'll meet each other somehow.
[2004.55s -> 2009.72s]  What about you? Someone needs to distract them from you and our invention. Don't sweat it. I'll
[2009.72s -> 2013.88s]  make it out. This is only one of many hideouts. Someone needs to hold the flood gates open for
[2013.88s -> 2018.87s]  you and I have my stun gun. Don't worry. We'll see each other on the other side. Outside you'll need
[2018.87s -> 2032.34s]  to open the first gate. There's no time. Hurry. Open it. Let's go. Let's go. Give me out. Give
[2032.34s -> 2048.66s]  me up. Don't worry. I know a way out. All right. Open it. Let's go. Good luck. I need to put a new
[2048.66s -> 2059.50s]  date in, right? Reactor is on. Okay. Put a new date in. Type in a date. Month? What is it? What's
[2059.50s -> 2070.47s]  April? April four? Oh four? Dude, what am I looking at here? What is going on? No, I don't
[2070.47s -> 2093.77s]  understand. Cool it off. Cool it off. Cool it off. How do I actually do this? What the fuck? Set
[2093.77s -> 2108.62s]  destination. Four one one two. How do I actually use this thing? Time target. Present departure.
[2108.62s -> 2121.08s]  How do I? I can't. How do I punch this in? 41 o'clock. I don't want to actually go to
[2121.08s -> 2129.14s]  this time period. It literally set. Yeah, but I can't. I don't know. There's one, two, three,
[2129.14s -> 2136.10s]  four, five, six slots. How am I supposed to know which one I'm doing? Okay. When I just typed it
[2136.10s -> 2143.24s]  in, it did this one, this one, then this. It like jumped around because this is the present day.
[2144.34s -> 2154.65s]  Set departure time. Type in a date. Okay. Like month first. 04 is April, right? Why is it not
[2154.65s -> 2165.85s]  working? I'm just fucking driving. It's the letters. What are you talking about? Letters for
[2165.85s -> 2183.14s]  month. APR. No, the guys, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. Nothing works. APR is April. Yeah,
[2183.14s -> 2197.16s]  but I can't. I don't understand. I can't change it. It doesn't make any sense. Type a date and
[2197.16s -> 2209.99s]  confirm with enter. Okay, let's try this again. I need to remove the override chip. All right,
[2209.99s -> 2246.86s]  let's take it out. How do I get the fuck out of here? Okay, let me try this again. Time target.
[2247.58s -> 2258.36s]  All right, the reactor's off. Everything's good. Should I travel now? Do I have to go 70? Get the
[2258.36s -> 2272.79s]  chip out. Hold on. Dude, can I? How do I rip the fucking chip out of the thing?
[2278.15s -> 2299.48s]  Give it to me. All right, let's go. Okay, I made it out. Quest complete. Don't pull that up while
[2299.48s -> 2312.71s]  you're driving. Okay, sounds good. Oh, that was just scripted. I just, okay, I get it.
[2318.30s -> 2337.61s]  This is not an ending, right? In the heat of the takeover, planned by his group, one of the
[2337.61s -> 2347.48s]  inventors managed to... No, okay, I got it. I shouldn't even been touching anything. This was
[2347.48s -> 2355.62s]  all the scripted first, like, 20 minutes of the game. Everybody, like, wants me to go back to,
[2355.62s -> 2361.29s]  like, fucking 100 AD, but, like, I can't even do that. Now I have access to this stuff.
[2365.80s -> 2387.62s]  Take this off. It's gonna give me a fucking headache. Okay, so I made it out. Now let's get
[2387.62s -> 2396.26s]  in here. Get that thing out of here. Do I have a trunk or anything? I can put this stuff in. I
[2396.26s -> 2406.09s]  feel like it's gonna fall out. Okay, save the game. The autosave cannot be overwritten within this one.
[2408.55s -> 2422.33s]  One. All right, cool. So we are currently April 15th, 1984. 13. Parture. What does that mean?
[2422.89s -> 2432.68s]  Well, where should I go? Set date. Type a date and time. Okay, so I'm gonna type in...
[2433.64s -> 2442.25s]  Should it date some month first? Which would be 04, right? Okay, yeah, it is 04, not APR.
[2442.89s -> 2460.30s]  So let's do 04. 14. Let's go yesterday. 1984. And then we're gonna do it at 10 o'clock. We're
[2460.30s -> 2466.23s]  gonna go to yesterday. That's exciting. I'm just testing to see if the machine works.
[2467.53s -> 2474.65s]  I'm... Guys, know what? Fuck that. If you had access to a time machine, you are going to just
[2474.65s -> 2480.73s]  go back a day or so, man. Like, this... I'm not going back a thousand years. What if I... What if
[2480.73s -> 2488.79s]  I get stuck? What if I get stuck? I need to test to make sure it works. Let's go for it. You ready?
[2503.96s -> 2517.96s]  Let's go! What's happening? What's happening? I didn't hit enter. Yeah, it did.
[2518.92s -> 2534.06s]  Oh my... 04. 14. 1984. 10 o'clock. Enter. Reactor. Let's go. I don't have any uranium left?
[2536.78s -> 2548.74s]  Shit! I need to put the chip back in? Where is it? Where's the chip? Oh, fuck. I thought I had to
[2548.74s -> 2563.11s]  take the chip out because that was like the safety protocol. Oh dear god, where the fuck is it?
[2563.11s -> 2570.28s]  Where is it? I don't think I need to do that, guys. It wasn't part of the game that I take
[2570.28s -> 2579.19s]  the chip out. No, it's not relevant. It's not. So do I have... Am I out of reactor fluid? How can I
[2579.19s -> 2611.40s]  tell? Is there a way to tell? Okay. Why am I moving? Why am I moving? What's going on? Why... The car is
[2611.40s -> 2624.15s]  moving on its own. I mean, I'm driving it now, but that was weird. Why was it doing that? I will need
[2624.15s -> 2630.15s]  to... Okay. I always wanted to visit the distant future of 2014. Okay. Remove that mod chip.
[2632.20s -> 2636.92s]  Afterwards, I can input the destination if the time conduction is active and confirm it with enter.
[2637.72s -> 2660.74s]  Do I have to go to 2014? Is it just scripted? It said to get some snacks first. There's a donut
[2660.74s -> 2672.12s]  shop right here. I don't have any fuel. Where was that donut shop? Back there, right? Yeah. It said
[2672.12s -> 2688.18s]  get snacks because I have like a hunger meter. Uranium is at zero percent. Oh, okay. That makes
[2688.18s -> 2707.29s]  sense. So I should have one more uranium pod or do I have to actually go find one? All right,
[2707.29s -> 2722.63s]  let's get out of here. I have no money to best donuts. I don't have any money. Can I just take
[2722.63s -> 2743.16s]  them? Sell the car. All right. So what does the quest want me to... What does it say? Go first.
[2745.75s -> 2751.45s]  Buy some snacks. I don't have any money. Where am I supposed to get... You're telling me to buy snacks,
[2751.45s -> 2759.50s]  but you're not telling me where I get money. I have zero dollars. Do I have something in the trunk?
[2760.22s -> 2777.59s]  What the fuck? Why there's so much... There's so much back there. You don't have your hazmat suit on.
[2777.59s -> 2787.32s]  I don't care. I don't give a shit. No, that's wrong. Somebody pulls up. Hey, can I give you a hand,
[2787.32s -> 2813.80s]  stranger? Yeah. Come in here. Can you hold this? All right. We got a hundred percent uranium. I'm
[2813.80s -> 2824.36s]  ready. I'm ready to go. Okay. We've got uranium. I'm going to April 14th, 1984 at 10 o'clock
[2824.36s -> 2853.05s]  at the morning. I'm just... I want to see if it works. Here we go. All right. All right. I'm back.
[2854.65s -> 2866.17s]  It is currently April 14th, 1984 at 10 o'clock. Look at... Everyone's... Don't be alarmed.
[2873.90s -> 2890.33s]  You'll be talking about this for centuries, motherfuckers. This would be the number one
[2890.33s -> 2896.65s]  article on top of every webpage. You know what's... Yeah. I got out and I punched that guy. Yep.
[2897.45s -> 2908.86s]  You know what's funny though? That guy will be on every... That guy will be interviewed for every
[2908.86s -> 2918.87s]  major news outlet. I've probably made that guy fucking at least $100,000. That guy's going to
[2918.87s -> 2924.02s]  write a book and everyone will buy it because you're the guy that the time traveler interacted
[2924.02s -> 2938.50s]  with. Oh, fuck. I'm going to be... Turn it off. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[2938.50s -> 2953.80s]  I almost just fucking exploded in like a nuclear reaction. Can I do anything? Don't cut off the
[2953.80s -> 2958.66s]  time traveler. That's a big mistake. There's got to be like a quest I can do, right? I'm back
[2958.66s -> 2971.58s]  a day ago. Should I go back to the facility? I want to go back to the facility. It's been...
[2972.14s -> 2983.13s]  I'm going back to where I started. Back here. Wait a minute. This is literally a donut shop
[2984.14s -> 2997.19s]  tomorrow, right? Because there's a bridge. All right. I want to go see what's going on at the
[2997.19s -> 3003.19s]  facility. Your quest was for 2014. Yeah. But I wanted to... And now I understand how it works.
[3003.19s -> 3009.69s]  I'm not going to fucking finagle around and flop around like an idiot. Oh, there's the donut place.
[3014.30s -> 3025.82s]  It still sent you... No, it didn't. It didn't send me there. It's 1984. 1047. Close the door.
[3028.78s -> 3039.74s]  Close the car door, please. Because I want to see if he's there. There's money in your trunk. All
[3039.74s -> 3048.09s]  right. I'm very interested now. Now I get it. I understand how the game works. Don't worry. We're
[3048.09s -> 3059.59s]  good. Relax. We've got plenty of time. The reactor's off. I wish I could close this door.
[3064.26s -> 3090.79s]  Am I going to be in here? It's literally 1984. Go to 420-1969. What do I do? Just get out,
[3090.79s -> 3093.19s]  walk around and wheeze laughing and get in the car and leave.
[3097.70s -> 3108.49s]  There might be a material in here. All right. So there it is. It's not on fire. Can I just go in
[3108.49s -> 3134.14s]  the front door? Find yourself in the past and kill them. All right. Well, here's the front door.
[3134.14s -> 3147.72s]  I wonder if I can open this. All right. If I'm looking at the security camera right now,
[3147.72s -> 3154.55s]  then it's me in this car trying to get in the door. Jerma, I miss when you played games that
[3154.55s -> 3158.15s]  had substance. Now you just play dog shit fart simulator games that are made for the purpose
[3158.15s -> 3162.47s]  of being a meaningless, shallow novelty to fill up your... Dude, I don't know where you've been for
[3162.47s -> 3167.35s]  12 years, but this is like the thing that I do. This is literally what I've been doing for like
[3167.35s -> 3180.98s]  the last 12 fucking years. What was that person on about? My like fifth video I ever made on
[3180.98s -> 3194.71s]  YouTube was Insane Aquarium. What are you, you're supposed to crack? All right. So I don't think I
[3194.71s -> 3199.50s]  can get in. I'm going to go in the trunk though because now I can... Let me try something else.
[3202.94s -> 3220.79s]  It's a grandpa video. There's 50 bucks in here. All right. So I'm going to take this out. These
[3220.79s -> 3240.20s]  things are finite. I got to be really careful with this. Go to 2012? Let's go somewhere fucking weird.
[3240.84s -> 3246.87s]  Right? I'll buy food later. I got to be careful. I'm going to run out of stuff. All right. I'm going
[3246.87s -> 3251.99s]  to go to 2014 because that's the quest and I know I'm going to fuck this up. I'm going to soft lock
[3251.99s -> 3266.90s]  myself. So here we go. Let's just go to like, I don't know, July, July 4th, 2014. I guess. I don't
[3266.90s -> 3275.38s]  know. Was it, was it June? It's not. All right. And then I don't know like 10 a.m. July 4th. I don't
[3275.38s -> 3300.12s]  know. Let me get a good straightaway. Let's go. I'm ready. We're going to do the quest and then
[3300.12s -> 3321.35s]  after that I'm going to the dinosaurs. All right. So I, I went into the future. It's July, it's 2014.
[3325.30s -> 3344.04s]  Oh, okay. What's going on? Stop moving. Okay. So now what do I do? I always wanted to visit the
[3344.04s -> 3366.98s]  distant 2014. Okay. Just have to lay low. This looks kind of the same. This looks like this looks
[3366.98s -> 3378.12s]  identical. Nothing changed. What did I do? What? Wait, what happened? Why did I just time travel
[3378.12s -> 3383.72s]  to the same spot at the same exact time? Wouldn't I have just crashed into myself and we both would
[3383.72s -> 3396.31s]  have died? Oh my god. I wasted a fucking reactor. I only have two more of these. I'm going to,
[3404.76s -> 3410.60s]  that I did. I, why was, how would that have been a bit? I, I thought I was going to, what happened?
[3412.52s -> 3446.58s]  July, enter, right? Okay. Let's go for it. My trunk? What? What's wrong with the trunk?
[3449.59s -> 3482.60s]  What? Don't scare me like that. Seriously. What the hell? Let's go. July 4th, 2014. It is 10 AM.
[3483.16s -> 3501.02s]  Okay. I kind of, okay. I would, this is what I would do if I had a time machine.
[3503.61s -> 3508.97s]  Okay. If I had a time machine and I had unlimited uses on the time machine,
[3512.28s -> 3518.12s]  I would go into this donut shop, right? And I would go there and I'd be like, how are you? How
[3518.12s -> 3525.61s]  are you? Good to see you. And I would be like, and check that out. Bring it back. I'd say something
[3525.69s -> 3529.69s]  really like odd, just specific. And I would hand the money and I would leave. And then I would come
[3529.69s -> 3535.96s]  back like five years later and I would do the same exact thing. I would just be a fucking customer
[3535.96s -> 3539.48s]  at that point. Who cares? That person wouldn't even remember that you were there. They wouldn't
[3539.48s -> 3544.12s]  give a shit at all. You would just be a customer coming in again, like after five years. Why would
[3544.12s -> 3550.25s]  I time travel to do that? That would be stupid. They would have forgotten that you came in and
[3550.25s -> 3553.77s]  it would have been like, Oh, that guy was kind of weird. I met, that guy maybe was in the area.
[3553.77s -> 3560.94s]  Maybe he doesn't live here. That would be fucking dumb. Nevermind. Okay. I want donuts, chocolate
[3560.94s -> 3576.74s]  donuts. Oh, thanks. Can I pick them up? What will be friend? I make the best donuts. You know, this
[3576.74s -> 3580.82s]  would be a cool indicator to see if you went to a place and you went back in time, five years and
[3580.82s -> 3587.91s]  forward in time, five years, did the donuts taste the same or did the, um, go bring that donut back.
[3588.47s -> 3618.04s]  What time is it? July 4th, 2014 at 10 28. Come back and eat it again. All right. Well,
[3618.04s -> 3625.27s]  there's a new quest here. The future. I wonder what new inventions I will find here. Maybe I
[3625.27s -> 3629.67s]  can find some familiar faces. I should take a look at the town square. I remember Edward saying he
[3629.67s -> 3638.54s]  wanted to open an inventor shop somewhere. All right. Town square. Go back and stop yourself
[3638.54s -> 3648.94s]  from eating the donut because they changed the recipe and it's not as good. That's a cartoon.
[3649.10s -> 3653.74s]  I don't want to do it because I don't want to run out of material. I can travel one more time.
[3654.30s -> 3659.82s]  And you know, the joke where if you got three wishes, oh, I know what I would do. I have this
[3659.82s -> 3664.62s]  crazy elaborate plans for each one. I just had five wishes. I'm down to one. I haven't done it.
[3664.62s -> 3672.70s]  Fucking anything. So I'm full of shit. You know, I, I, what have we done? I've accidentally went to
[3672.70s -> 3687.22s]  the same place twice. I wanted to eat a donut again. What is this? What the fuck is that? What
[3687.22s -> 3702.81s]  is that? What is that? Why is this here? Does it drink that? Why the giant radioactive crabs in
[3702.81s -> 3718.52s]  2014? Who's doing that? What the fuck is this? Is nobody else seeing this? Is nobody else seeing
[3718.52s -> 3733.26s]  the giant crab that's attacking me? Hello. Wow. It's the future. Uh, okay. Wow. The future. Bye.
[3733.82s -> 3745.69s]  Where's the watch? Get that thing out of here. Oh, I gotta go. I don't like that.
[3748.79s -> 3753.56s]  I really don't like that thing. All right. I'm looking for a technology center.
[3753.56s -> 3773.67s]  I'm gonna get out of it. You have a quest. What is it? Any rumors? I've recently read about the
[3773.67s -> 3779.43s]  bank robbery in the 1870s in a document in Pine Lakes archives. It's worth a read. It's what
[3779.43s -> 3784.23s]  led Westwood into defeating 20 bandits single-handed. You remember the story. 1870s.
[3784.87s -> 3822.17s]  Okay. Eight. Somebody write that down. What just happened? That's two bucks. What can I get you?
[3822.17s -> 3843.08s]  You don't have anything to buy. You don't have any products. All right. I'm technically not
[3843.08s -> 3852.66s]  going to steal it. I'm going to throw it out the outside. How much is this? I would like to buy
[3852.66s -> 3867.86s]  this please. And what is this? Turns organic material into fuel. I only have $47. Box. This
[3867.86s -> 3873.53s]  box fits a small amount of items. I probably should get the flashlight, right? Yeah. I'll take a
[3873.61s -> 3889.51s]  flashlight. Oh my god. And a radio. What's in your favorite radio stations? No, I don't want that.
[3889.51s -> 3906.86s]  I'll take another reactor. Okay. This is what I would like to buy. Thank you. Can I take this?
[3906.86s -> 3918.20s]  I can take this out now, right? You're not gonna get pissed? I have 10 bucks left. Do other people
[3918.20s -> 3940.09s]  have time machines? Get the radio. I don't want the radio. I don't have enough money. Okay. Do I
[3940.09s -> 3954.95s]  have to hold it in front of my face? I have to... Who holds it like this? Can I not just put it on
[3954.95s -> 3970.38s]  my... Okay. All right. There we go. There we go. There we go. Put this in the trunk too. All right.
[3970.38s -> 3982.15s]  I gotta keep looking around because there's apparently a technology thing somewhere. Wait.
[3982.15s -> 3995.00s]  Is this it? Build the second mechanic. I'd like to modify my car. Can you repair my car? Park it in
[3995.00s -> 3999.98s]  the garage and then I'll take a look at it. All right. This thing's probably beat up. How much
[3999.98s -> 4013.34s]  health does it have? Can I tell? What are you doing? Why are you dumb? Turn the flashlight off?
[4020.98s -> 4036.54s]  Why do you care about the flashlight being on? There's no battery in the flashlight, dude.
[4037.18s -> 4055.35s]  What are you talking about? All right. What if I put my destination to 10 seconds ago so that
[4055.35s -> 4064.07s]  my car pulls up and then there's a huge flash and another one of my cars pulls up? What would he do?
[4064.07s -> 4098.04s]  What would he do? Okay. This thing's fixed. I want to go to the 1870s. Get out of the way.
[4098.04s -> 4100.60s]  All right. I need to... Let me do this quest part. I'm looking for...
[4101.48s -> 4112.39s]  This is the town square, I'm assuming. All right. Can I fast forward like one minute to when I...
[4112.39s -> 4124.07s]  After I did that jump because I'm gonna do it. Job requests? Oh, okay. Here's a new location.
[4124.87s -> 4138.79s]  There was a bank robbery in Pine Lake during the 1870s. Maybe I'll get some money. All right.
[4138.79s -> 4161.02s]  Where am I? Money drop head? Okay. This is definitely the town square. What else was in
[4161.02s -> 4183.59s]  there? Oh, nice. A sandwich. Sheriff Westwood. Deeds of Sheriff Pine Lake. Okay. So the first
[4183.59s -> 4206.62s]  quest is to go back. Oh, where is it? Hello. Welcome to my workshop. I am E.R. Aether Inventor.
[4206.62s -> 4217.14s]  Are you here for a scientific con... Oh, it's him. It's um... It's the guy. Hey. Wait a minute.
[4217.14s -> 4223.05s]  You look rather familiar. Have we met before? Never mind that now. I'm in the middle of something
[4223.05s -> 4229.45s]  big. Hey, is this something I've got to... We'll have plenty of time to talk later. I'm afraid this
[4229.45s -> 4234.81s]  takes precedence. Okay. I'm building an atmospheric motivator. A device that transfuses the very
[4234.81s -> 4240.81s]  particles of high and low temperatures at will. English professor. I'm building a weather machine
[4240.81s -> 4248.98s]  and all I need is a couple of items to help with its assembly. What do you need? Okay. Here. Take
[4248.98s -> 4253.30s]  it. Copy it into your personal log. It shouldn't be too hard. There are only a few more things I
[4253.30s -> 4262.46s]  need. Magnetometer? It's a di... Device which meters magnets, of course. It's obvious. Besides,
[4262.46s -> 4267.58s]  it's the MacGuffin. For most inventions these days, there should be some down the road at 612.
[4268.46s -> 4274.23s]  That they're pretty pricey. I suggest that you get it from Burns Scientific Store at Bridgetown.
[4275.11s -> 4276.25s]  Bridgetown.
[4279.77s -> 4283.93s]  The northern end of Cape Dun, a town located on top of a bridge, quite literally.
[4284.49s -> 4286.89s]  Sea Corp is behind that monstrosity to copy St.
[4287.77s -> 4291.53s]  Andry, that ugly megacity just on the other side of the coast. Anyway,
[4291.53s -> 4296.25s]  his shop is located on the top floor at the back. Okay, so we gotta go. We gotta go to
[4296.25s -> 4310.07s]  northern end of Cape Dun. Take a hover train to Bridgetown. I have a time machine. Okay.
[4311.34s -> 4314.38s]  Uranium is perfectly safe. Well, almost perfectly safe since ever since the
[4314.38s -> 4327.24s]  prismic ceiling glass was invented in 1992. Ten times stronger than lead. Okay. I need something
[4327.24s -> 4338.82s]  that can conduct enough gigawatts to power the machine. Okay. A what? He's thinking.
[4341.90s -> 4352.73s]  Too much lore? I think it's just enough lore. Okay. What could do the job?
[4353.53s -> 4358.73s]  Unless you someone get back my family heirloom pocket watch. Did I? Could I have gotten it back
[4358.73s -> 4368.73s]  when I wasted a time travel device? Okay. One of the first settlers had a pocket watch of set
[4368.73s -> 4373.37s]  quality. Let's just go to one, right? Let's just do it. I'm gonna go. Look, I could buy. I got,
[4373.37s -> 4380.95s]  I got a, I got a limited amount of money. I got, I could, I could go. I could do the quest later.
[4383.40s -> 4395.19s]  Let's go meet Jesus. Okay. Back then, the Park Hill was our estate and he lived just next to it.
[4395.91s -> 4409.08s]  He never told me this story. I did just now. All right. Okay. Let's do it. Yeah. Yeah. Like
[4409.08s -> 4452.47s]  you never seen a fucking time travel machine before. Car flipper. Do I have a map? Okay. Am I
[4452.47s -> 4474.86s]  flying? My car can't do that. That's not fair. That's bullshit. I I'm from the past, man. I don't
[4474.86s -> 4499.98s]  understand this stuff. Why am I stuck? Yes, it can. I'm actually stuck. Use the car flipper.
[4504.14s -> 4510.98s]  I'm going to fall off again. Go out the other door. What the fuck have I done? I'm going to fall off
[4510.98s -> 4518.38s]  again. And this time I'm probably going to die. I think I can get out eventually. I'm just loading
[4518.38s -> 4538.36s]  the game. Here. Here's real time travel for you. I'm loading this save file. Done. Okay. Let's load
[4538.36s -> 4571.27s]  up the car. I'm not going to use it. I just want to make sure it's in there. Okay. Let's go. What
[4571.27s -> 4577.14s]  are you guys doing? Stop. So should I go? I got to go to the northern end of this area.
[4577.78s -> 4587.18s]  There's there's three. There's two or three quests. I can go get the stuff for that guy.
[4587.18s -> 4600.74s]  What is that? Okay. His heirloom brass clock from 1795. Uranium from 612.
[4602.25s -> 4630.62s]  Or the. Okay. Let's go. Let's go to 1795. Go to year one. You said one. Let's go. Fine.
[4636.25s -> 4639.05s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[4639.05s -> 4653.10s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Where are my headlights?
[4680.28s -> 4695.67s]  Whatever. Shut up. I just got a little startled. Where's Jesus? Jesus. Jesus. I have a lot of
[4695.67s -> 4720.01s]  important stuff to tell you. Can I get lost? I can't see anything. Where's the snow in 1 AD?
[4720.01s -> 4724.10s]  Don't you feel like that all this stuff shouldn't be here? I know that's not that far away, but it
[4724.10s -> 4729.45s]  kind of feels like it should be, right? I feel like there wasn't grass. Think about that, right? I feel
[4729.45s -> 4741.37s]  like there wasn't grass in like 600 million BC. Isn't that weird to think about? I'll drive around
[4741.37s -> 4756.89s]  for a minute. NA education. No, I know that it exists. I'm just saying it's weird to think about.
[4757.90s -> 4767.05s]  I keep taking this fucking thing out and I'm an idiot. I'm going to start holding on to these
[4767.69s -> 4775.62s]  because if I go back in time, maybe it'll be Phil again. All right. I'm going to drive around for
[4775.62s -> 4783.35s]  a little bit. Do I have my, where are my headlights? Okay. They're on. Are they on? I can't, I really
[4783.35s -> 4844.94s]  can't tell. I wear my headlights. There we go. I guess it's really not that interesting. What's,
[4844.94s -> 4854.15s]  what would be so interesting here? It's just outside. That's it. I don't know what everyone
[4854.15s -> 4867.46s]  was expecting. It's just outside. Even if there were dinosaurs or even if there were other animals,
[4867.46s -> 4874.95s]  it'd probably be pretty hard to find them. Even right now. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's
[4874.95s -> 4891.24s]  a structure here. What's going on? What is this? Okay. If you, if I, if you walked into the woods
[4892.06s -> 4899.61s]  right now and your goal was I'm going to find a bear, you probably wouldn't. Like what are you
[4899.61s -> 4905.02s]  talking about? That's, that's just not going to happen. They could, they could, there's so much
[4905.02s -> 4919.10s]  surface area. They could be anywhere. They could be anywhere. It would take like hours potentially
[4919.10s -> 4926.18s]  to find one. At least an hour, which I'm not giving them more than an hour to look for a dinosaur.
[4931.69s -> 4939.21s]  Airbag just fucking hits me in the face. I'm just unconscious.
[4943.62s -> 4952.14s]  How would this change the course of human history? Because there's nuclear shit in here. Somebody
[4952.14s -> 4967.82s]  would find this and I would change the complete course of all history. 120 FOV Andy. What's wrong
[4967.82s -> 5018.66s]  with that? Is this water? I thought this was slate. Let's go to like 9999. No, not that's too easy.
[5018.66s -> 5039.40s]  Let's go somewhere weird. I don't want to go to one and then 9999. Okay. I'll go to 2323. That
[5039.40s -> 5052.52s]  sounds fun. And I just said to not do that number of whatever. We're here. Okay. Here we go. Okay.
[5052.52s -> 5081.46s]  Let's go to 1225 Christmas at, I don't know, somewhere in like the evening. Let's go.
[5094.34s -> 5124.20s]  My FOV is not 120. It's 90. Oops. Oh no. Civilization. What happened? No, this is a bad,
[5124.20s -> 5137.14s]  this is not a good Christmas. 25. Wait, what? This thing bugged. I don't, the difference between
[5137.14s -> 5157.14s]  one AD and 25 AD is not that long. I didn't type it in wrong. What? What happened? I did not type
[5157.14s -> 5182.55s]  that in wrong. Was it a typo? It's set for December 25th, 1225. The maximum is 2030. Oh, that's right.
[5185.37s -> 5206.30s]  So what did I just say? I just nuked the earth. Oh, this sucks. Christmas doesn't exist in 2525.
[5206.30s -> 5222.06s]  Whatever. I didn't cool it off. Oh, whatever. Civilization didn't exist anymore. All right. I
[5222.06s -> 5228.79s]  want to go, I'm going to, okay, I'm going to put it all my favorite numbers. You ready? What are some
[5228.79s -> 5243.42s]  of my favorite numbers? Okay. I like, I like 10. I also like, I like seven and then think of a few
[5243.42s -> 5249.61s]  digits. What's some of my favorite numbers? I like the number 10. No, I like the number five.
[5253.64s -> 5273.75s]  I like five. I also like three. I also like seven. No, I like seven. Okay. I also like the number 10.
[5273.75s -> 5313.56s]  I also like the number five. Let's go. Okay. Where are we at? 540, like year 537.
[5314.20s -> 5324.25s]  Holy shit, that's always really loud. I just, whatever. This is the middle ages.
[5324.97s -> 5345.30s]  So this is probably like a town, right? Try just look for a town. I'm going to find a settlement.
[5345.30s -> 5351.66s]  I'm going to run around screaming. You'll never be the same. You'll never be the same. None of you
[5351.66s -> 5360.92s]  will ever be the same. I'm going to go like this with a lighter. Then I'm going to show my phone
[5360.92s -> 5397.37s]  to everybody. I'm going to go like this and I'm going to leave. Settlement? No. Oh, the world was
[5397.37s -> 5415.53s]  really boring before fucking Twitter, huh? This is in the middle of nowhere in Arizona. Check your
[5415.53s -> 5438.79s]  world map. Do I have a world map? M? World map. Ancient ruins? Guys, this ancient ruins. How do I
[5438.79s -> 5454.86s]  get here? Oh my God. All right. Fuck everything else. We're going to the ancient ruins. Shit.
[5454.86s -> 5464.22s]  All right. So I got to turn around and go this way. So just turn the car completely around,
[5464.22s -> 5489.22s]  just drive this way. All right. This is cool. I'm very excited now. Let's go. Maybe I'll run
[5489.22s -> 5513.37s]  into some people. Don't drive into the lake. I'm not going to drive into the lake. Not again. All
[5513.37s -> 5522.81s]  right. Don't go a hundred miles per hour. Being stupid. All right. This pine lake, old forest.
[5522.81s -> 5530.36s]  Where are the, wait, when the ruins? What happened to the ancient ruins? They're gone. There's no
[5530.36s -> 5541.06s]  ancient ruins anymore. Lower your FOV. It's not that high. It's literally 90. What do you want it
[5541.30s -> 5593.78s]  at? It's the first ever McDonald's. What actually is this? This is a tree? Why is there a tree made
[5593.78s -> 5612.06s]  out of weird like banana leaves? What is this? Should I take a sample or something? That's kind
[5612.06s -> 5631.61s]  of weird. This is tar? Were there really tar pits like this at five, six hundred A.D.? I don't know
[5631.61s -> 5645.40s]  why, but like a big tar pit to me sounds like it should be long, long time ago. Something right
[5645.40s -> 5660.17s]  here. What the fuck? There was just like a settlement. All right. Where are those ruins?
[5660.17s -> 5669.22s]  There's the lake, old forest. Let's go to the old forest. Why don't just please go to A.D. 69.
[5669.22s -> 5715.64s]  I'm thinking about it. All right. Old forest. I think I'm there. Yeah. Ancient ruins. Stop. Oh
[5715.64s -> 5749.05s]  my God. I think I'm going to get on foot. So don't smash up the car. It says they were here.
[5749.05s -> 5787.51s]  What's that? There's an animal. Any supplies or anything? They don't have, where's anything?
[5787.51s -> 5804.41s]  Wait, now travel from here. Oh, wait a minute. Dude, if I travel right here and I go either back
[5804.41s -> 5816.15s]  or forward, this is kind of, this is cool. I'm actually into this. All right. Let's go. Let's
[5816.15s -> 5825.64s]  go forward. What? A couple hundred years or go backwards a hundred years. Is this the ancient
[5825.64s -> 5833.62s]  site? I would imagine it is, right? Kind of has to be. It says it's like here. Yeah. These are ancient
[5833.62s -> 5838.71s]  ruins, which means like two or three hundred years ago. Let's do it. I'm going to save the game
[5838.71s -> 5842.71s]  because I want to make sure I don't get this wrong. I want it on. I want unlimited. I want to explore.
[5842.71s -> 5858.50s]  I don't want to do the quests. Only two or three hundred. What do you mean? I'm almost out. Go to
[5858.58s -> 5874.73s]  300. Will that be there when I come back? OK. All right. You guys ready? We're going to find out
[5874.73s -> 5882.18s]  who this ancient civilization was. So we're going to go back a hundred years ago, October 7th,
[5882.82s -> 5898.63s]  or, I mean, September, whatever. Let's go to September 7, zero, 200, zero, 100.
[5899.27s -> 5911.05s]  100 years, dude, is barely one generation. But you know what I mean? Let's go 100 or like,
[5911.05s -> 5924.58s]  I don't know, 20, 50. I'm going to try 50 A.D. Let's go. Not enough speed.
[5937.34s -> 5950.18s]  I'm just doing donuts at the ancient site. Whatever. I'm just going to go this way.
[5953.43s -> 5965.62s]  I didn't hit enter. Like, boom, it disappeared. It's fucking left here. All right. Wait, wait,
[5965.62s -> 5988.76s]  wait, wait, wait. I did. Yes, I did. I hit enter on 5 a.m. There. What the hell was that?
[6005.11s -> 6019.93s]  Come on. I got to get speed. All right. All right. All right. I'm good. I'm good.
[6021.22s -> 6053.69s]  Oh, all right. Let's go back to that place. See what's going on. Get these fucking trees. I'm so
[6053.69s -> 6074.20s]  mad right now. OK. I'm not going to bang a right. What's why is it so weird looking? So why is so
[6074.20s -> 6131.85s]  green? There it is. All right. Humans have been around for 250,000 years. I can't I can't go back
[6131.85s -> 6154.76s]  that far. Go negative. I can only do zero, zero, zero. All right. Let me load it. I'm going to go
[6154.76s -> 6167.24s]  forward and see what happens. Go B.C. I can't. I don't think I can. Yeah, it's only A.D. right now.
[6167.24s -> 6179.62s]  One A.D. would have it maybe. Yeah, I can only go to one. I want to see what happens in the future.
[6179.62s -> 6191.85s]  So what do we think? Maybe like a thousand, like 1200 A.D. Do the quest. I'll do the quest,
[6191.85s -> 6196.86s]  but I just want to do this one more time. Let me load the game because I want to see if anything
[6196.86s -> 6204.78s]  actually changes here. Does that be cool if it did? Yeah, I'm going to lap my ass off if the
[6204.78s -> 6215.26s]  ruins are the exact same and it's like the year 2000. OK, here we go. I think I need to put the
[6215.82s -> 6238.14s]  I can't leave the car. Stop doing that. All right. After this, we'll do the quest.
[6238.70s -> 6241.98s]  I just want to see if it was possible. All right. We're going to go to
[6246.92s -> 6266.79s]  1210. OK, what? 1500, 2000, 1500 at during the day. So like noon. You think that's good? Let's
[6266.87s -> 6330.47s]  try it. Oh, come on. We didn't go yet. No. Although I could pretend if you were in the car here,
[6330.47s -> 6337.64s]  get out and look around and then see if you, you know, oh, hey, yeah, look how different
[6337.64s -> 6346.10s]  everything is and see if you're like, holy shit, wow, everything's so different. Let's
[6346.10s -> 6353.48s]  drive around a circle five times and tell somebody you actually time traveled. It's got to get under
[6353.48s -> 6362.50s]  300 and then I can go. Can we get ice cream if you're good and you haven't been very good?
[6362.58s -> 6398.33s]  It's a fucking dinosaur. I'm in the car. I'm in the car. What are you talking about?
[6398.33s -> 6419.69s]  I'm literally in the car. Did I kill him? Did I kill him? I don't know if I killed him.
[6419.69s -> 6445.10s]  I'm sure that won't affect anything. Why can't I kill it? I can't. I don't think I can kill it.
[6445.10s -> 6461.18s]  Wait, I come in peace. I have a cheeseburger in the backseat. No, I don't. OK, if I fed this weird
[6461.18s -> 6466.30s]  alien creature a cheeseburger, would it change genetic makeup throughout all of history of animals?
[6466.30s -> 6513.16s]  What the fuck is happening? Like, what do we use? Let's go. No, I didn't mean to punch. Can I ride
[6513.16s -> 6529.05s]  it? I think I bugged it out when it went into the car. I can't. I want to like bring it with me.
[6539.85s -> 6545.34s]  I'm in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car. There's a bunch of sciences that definitely want
[6545.34s -> 6594.62s]  to see you. All right, whatever. Fuck you guys. I'm going to 1500 AD. See you later. Have fun
[6594.62s -> 6634.70s]  with the fucking meteor. All right, we're at 1500. Let's go check it out. I have to bring the car,
[6634.70s -> 6645.38s]  man. Quick, dude. Make Among Us before the other people do. You don't understand. If I made Among
[6645.38s -> 6658.31s]  Us, it wouldn't be successful. Nobody would play it. No, it doesn't work like that. My Among Us
[6658.31s -> 6668.76s]  would be just barely slightly different and it would not take off. You should go. That's the idea?
[6669.93s -> 6676.25s]  What? So I go back and make Among Us and make it shitty so that nobody cares about it. You guys
[6676.25s -> 6682.90s]  really don't like that game. Of all the things we could change in all history, you want me to go back
[6682.90s -> 6701.18s]  and make sure Among Us is not popular. Okay, this is a fun game. What's wrong with you? All right,
[6701.18s -> 6708.95s]  so this is this is where 1500 AD. It's been about a thousand years. Here we are. What does civilization
[6708.95s -> 6725.74s]  look like? Why is it so radioactive here? Everything's, everything's radiated. Have I
[6725.74s -> 6732.79s]  been doing it too much here? I've been traveling through time in this one location too many times
[6732.79s -> 6746.23s]  that I've, I've irradiated the- there's nobody here? Holy shit, the whole world is green. What did I do?
[6746.87s -> 6752.30s]  Too many times in the same spot?
[6816.92s -> 6861.02s]  What's happening? It's even worse. What is happening to the world? What had, what happened?
[6862.22s -> 6867.69s]  Did I, I've ruined civilization. I just wanted to see if there were any people in these houses.
[6868.33s -> 6878.20s]  I fucked up everything. Wait, what if I go to the- what if I just go to- okay, wait a minute.
[6879.70s -> 6885.37s]  It's the year 2000. What if I just go to one of these stores? Did I really ruin everything?
[6887.35s -> 6891.93s]  I'm gonna just drive this way. Did I fuck up the whole world? Do I have to restart the whole game?
[6893.38s -> 6901.05s]  I'm gonna go touch that. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna put my face in that. You never know guys,
[6901.05s -> 6905.50s]  it could be like the Matrix. I might put my head in here and like know how to fly a helicopter.
[6912.66s -> 6956.07s]  What? It was a collectible. Oh my fucking god. Did I seriously just kill myself? That's so fucking
[6956.07s -> 6962.26s]  dumb. All right. Should I, I'm gonna, all right, I'm gonna go back. I think I fucked up a lot of
[6962.26s -> 6969.72s]  stuff here. Let me just see. I gotta, all right, I gotta get out of here. This is, there's nobody
[6969.72s -> 6974.89s]  here. There's no civilization here. There's just these squares with holes in them. That's it. I,
[6978.94s -> 6982.86s]  Jerma fucking hates the Lorax. I've never seen that movie and I never read the book. I don't
[6982.86s -> 6997.38s]  know what it is. I just know Danny DeVito is the main character. I want to go here. We're gonna
[6997.38s -> 7003.82s]  check one thing. I'm going to do the mission, but I gotta turn this way because this is where
[7003.82s -> 7014.98s]  the town is. I'm going up there. I give off Lorax vibes. What do you, what does that mean?
[7023.35s -> 7025.83s]  I don't know what that means. You have to elaborate. I don't know what you're talking about.
[7032.73s -> 7055.48s]  Okay. So it's 537. That's the year. Droppings. Some kind of droppings over there. Okay. Now I
[7055.48s -> 7074.95s]  gotta bang a left. He's short and orange. I mean, I am kind of orange today. I'm not wearing
[7074.95s -> 7084.74s]  concealer. No, I'm, I am a little orange. You're right. This is a good place to do it because I
[7084.74s -> 7091.34s]  want to go to the, I'm going to save it. We're going to go to the year 2000. We're going to
[7091.34s -> 7104.36s]  go to the year 2000. No, we're not. What do I want to do? It was a bank robbery in Pine Lake during
[7104.36s -> 7112.12s]  the 18 seventies. Supposedly this led Westwood discovering the secret hideout of some 20 bandits.
[7114.23s -> 7119.61s]  The courthouse archives in Pine Lake supposedly have a document on it. All right. I'm just going
[7119.61s -> 7125.13s]  to time travel again and load like save number one, whatever it was. Cause I kind of, I'm interested
[7125.13s -> 7132.26s]  in that. I want to know what that means. Um, this one here, drink some more water. I got it right
[7132.26s -> 7142.20s]  here. What do you think this is? Yeah. All right. So this puts us back here. Let's go to the archives.
[7142.20s -> 7156.41s]  I want to, I want to look at that up. So this is, I need the city archives. This looks like a city
[7156.41s -> 7184.07s]  building. This time don't dump nuclear waste everywhere. I didn't, it was empty. All right.
[7184.07s -> 7199.53s]  This 612 store has it, but where do, it said to go up, right? Cape Dunn. That's for the other guy,
[7199.53s -> 7209.74s]  the old guy that used to be our friend. Uh, I want to do the 1800s one. So I need to go to the city
[7209.74s -> 7221.72s]  archive where I don't know where that is. Oh, it's probably here, right? Recycling station.
[7229.11s -> 7232.71s]  Thanks. I really did not want it to go the other way. Who's talking to me?
[7235.43s -> 7239.11s]  All right. I need the, I need the courthouse or something. Wait, what do you have?
[7242.73s -> 7247.21s]  Huh? Yes. Why are you sad? Uh, well, I don't know if I should even tell at this point.
[7249.11s -> 7255.02s]  What's about her? Yeah. Well, Sandy, she works in that ice cream shop just across the square.
[7257.40s -> 7262.84s]  Lowers his voice. I mean, yes, I want to ask her out. Why don't you just ask her out? I thought
[7262.84s -> 7272.46s]  about making a nice present of sorts that would fit her. Okay. A flower, just one flower. No,
[7272.46s -> 7278.52s]  it's a special one. It's called the Eleanor. Seemingly everybody tells me I should stop
[7278.52s -> 7282.68s]  dreaming. This particular plan is extinct for hundreds of years now. I know I can find one.
[7282.68s -> 7292.17s]  I'll have to search really, really hard. Am I really going to go back in time and pick a flower
[7292.17s -> 7311.11s]  for this guy? Sure. Yeah, I can help. Okay. Look at the bookstore. Okay. I think you can look at the
[7311.11s -> 7316.70s]  bookstore just next to the mechanic. Get that flower book and see if it can help you. I want
[7316.70s -> 7324.57s]  to go do the bandit thing. All right. No, no, no. I want the courthouse. I need that map to show me
[7324.57s -> 7337.74s]  where the courthouse is. Fucking burping and y'all and you can hear it. I hate that. Do the flower
[7337.74s -> 7397.00s]  plot line. No, that's boring. I want to go fight the bandits. I'm not hitting the tree. Okay. Town
[7397.00s -> 7406.34s]  square. It's probably where the statue was, right? I'm going to assume that statue is over here.
[7417.70s -> 7441.08s]  Oh, information. This is definitely it. 100%. Okay. Post office archives. There it is.
[7441.08s -> 7465.13s]  What's that? Why is that a health bar on the screen? Okay. This is nice. I'm looking for info
[7465.13s -> 7487.94s]  on the robbery that happened. Nevermind. You're not going to help me. Oh shit. After a lengthy
[7487.94s -> 7491.46s]  interrogation, I managed to deduct that the thieves have been hiding underneath the well
[7492.58s -> 7498.18s]  known waterfall in the west. That's when I ambushed and defeated the 20 bandits in their boss.
[7499.06s -> 7502.34s]  My new friend helped me in the ambush by his clever distraction.
[7503.22s -> 7509.13s]  I recovered a load of redacted material from the cave. All the captured bandits are to be relocated
[7509.77s -> 7518.01s]  to Isla de los Tontos charged for robbery. By the speedy aid of my friend. This is,
[7518.01s -> 7524.06s]  they're talking about me. There was a minor altercation afterwards with
[7525.13s -> 7530.22s]  Diego's gang. They tried to steal our recovered goods from the bank. They weren't much a problem.
[7530.22s -> 7535.58s]  I suggest also moving them to Isla de los Tontos charged for it. Okay. So this is 1871.
[7538.14s -> 7545.50s]  1871. The robbery of Pine Island Nashville occurred March 15th, 1871 at 1 20 p.m.
[7546.06s -> 7564.62s]  So we should go there at 12 and just wait. Write that down. Yeah, you write it down for me.
[7565.18s -> 7575.11s]  It happened at the well. All right. 12 o'clock, March 15th, 1871, 12 o'clock. Pine Island National
[7575.11s -> 7607.27s]  Bank. Write it down. Let's go. You write it down. I can't. My hands are occupied. All right. Where's
[7607.27s -> 7638.44s]  the bank? Fuck. Where's the bank? I see. I didn't know where the bank is. Park train station. It's
[7638.44s -> 7651.61s]  not on here. I said to find it. I know you have a quest, but fine. What is it? Any rumors? I heard
[7651.61s -> 7656.49s]  back in the 70s there was this accordion man who you would not want to meet at nights in the forest.
[7659.62s -> 7662.90s]  I suppose you could try it in the town archives. I don't care about the accordion man.
[7663.70s -> 7680.63s]  Where's the bank? Ice cream. Where's the bank? Is this a bank? No, it's like a recycling center.
[7680.63s -> 7697.00s]  Where's the bank? Books, hoverboards. I don't know. I'm not doing accordion man. I don't want
[7697.00s -> 7724.71s]  to do that right now. If I zoom in, will it say? Do it after the bank? Maybe. You didn't read
[7724.71s -> 7741.13s]  homestuck. What does it have to do with anything? This is not a bank. This is a library. There's the
[7741.13s -> 7761.38s]  lab. Where's this fucking bank? Oh, bank time. So this is where I need to be. I'm going to get here
[7761.38s -> 7770.33s]  at noon. That's let me look at the map because literally I've messed this up. All right. It is
[7770.33s -> 7777.30s]  right below that pine lake thing, right below it kind of to the south western area right
[7777.30s -> 7789.72s]  into the ice cream shop. Let's go. All right. Where's the car? All right. I'm just going to
[7789.72s -> 7793.96s]  drive down this street and I'm going to get there at noon. We'll be there about an hour early
[7793.96s -> 7804.15s]  for me to stop the robbery. You're disgusting. Why would you say something weird like that?
[7805.42s -> 7827.43s]  All right. Here we go. Get in. I'm ready. Let's do it. What was the date again? It was something
[7830.49s -> 7858.44s]  something is March 3 15. No, what do you? Okay. Three. I'm trying to do the fucking month. What
[7858.44s -> 7871.08s]  is it? Oh, oh, three. What is going on right now? Oh, it won't accept. Oh, three. Oh, three.
[7871.08s -> 7888.04s]  I just did that three times. Oh, three. Stop giving random dates. 1871 at 12 noon. Let's go for it.
[7888.04s -> 7935.88s]  Let's fucking do it. Let's get to the bank. I need a better straight away. There we go. What even
[7935.88s -> 7960.14s]  happened? Too much juice. All right. The bank. They're going to rob the bank. Turn that off.
[7960.14s -> 7969.69s]  Turn that off. Turn it off. All right. They're going to rob the bank in an hour. I want to sell
[7969.69s -> 8023.43s]  my no. What do I do? How do I stop them? I'm going to do anybody suspicious. I don't have
[8023.43s -> 8032.86s]  a weapon or anything. Go tell the sheriff. Sheriff. Sheriff. Listen to me. Am I too late?
[8038.55s -> 8047.82s]  What exploded? What did I just do? I didn't just blow up the bank. Get out of the fucking way.
[8047.82s -> 8064.22s]  Sheriff. Sheriff. Everything's safe. No, it's not safe. Oh my God. What time is it? Four. Wait,
[8064.22s -> 8103.03s]  they already robbed it? Is that them robbing the bank? What? I did it. Wait, why were they coming
[8103.03s -> 8110.49s]  out of my car as if I brought them here? I backed up the car into the bank and they all started
[8110.49s -> 8143.88s]  getting out of the car. Everybody wants to rob it. Okay. So I went to... Wait, what? Oh, it's an auto
[8143.88s -> 8184.46s]  save. I'm getting in the car. Should I get a gun? They haven't robbed it yet. Why did the month and
[8184.54s -> 8208.06s]  day change? Throw uranium at them. Year 2000. Wait, what's going on? How come the dates are
[8208.06s -> 8241.99s]  different? I'm so confused. Oh, okay. 120. I'm ready. Oh my God. Go talk to the sheriff. I tried
[8241.99s -> 8249.03s]  to talk to the sheriff and he didn't have anything to say. He just said, oh, all right. There's no
[8249.03s -> 8279.06s]  options. Here we go. That wasn't the sheriff. Why was he standing behind the counter? I can't
[8280.78s -> 8293.06s]  interact with him. Sorry. What fucking time is it? What? 13. Oh, right. It's not a regular clock.
[8293.06s -> 8350.92s]  It's a 20. What the fuck? It kind of works. Five minutes and then another wave. Excuse me?
[8351.64s -> 8365.10s]  Excuse me? The car won't turn on. What? You can't be fucking serious. Why is it so dark?
[8379.13s -> 8393.32s]  Why did the fucking car turn off? I'm getting a gun. What is that? Did it run out of gas? I don't
[8393.32s -> 8399.83s]  know what happened. I need to go get a weapon or something. $4 back in the 1800s is like $50
[8399.83s -> 8430.86s]  million. So I'll be fine. Two bucks. What do you? I don't think I can get a gun. So how am I
[8430.86s -> 8437.02s]  supposed to? There's a lot of people that come in. Can I get like a melee weapon? Blacksmith. Here
[8437.02s -> 8475.56s]  we go. Can I buy something? Ooh, revolver parts. Okay. 20 bucks. I need money. Motherfucker. I'm
[8475.56s -> 8480.12s]  going to go back in time again. I gotta go find gold or something. Go back another. Oh my God.
[8480.76s -> 8497.91s]  I gotta go back like three days and find gold and sell it. I gotta find gold here. You should
[8497.91s -> 8517.61s]  just rob the bank. Okay. No, there's gotta be gold, right? Rob the bank and then travel back in time
[8517.61s -> 8523.59s]  and pay with the stolen money. But wouldn't I always rob the bank if I kept going back?
[8524.31s -> 8556.23s]  What about their hideout? Don't you have a bank to rob? Why is everybody chasing me?
[8556.95s -> 8590.44s]  They're not robbing the bank. I'm preventing the bank robbery. They're shooting each other.
[8590.92s -> 8648.25s]  The fuck? What happened? I think if I wrap around and eat a barbecue sandwich, I think I'd be fine.
[8648.25s -> 8691.34s]  Where's the barbecue place? Get out of here. There's people attacking town. I got it. I got
[8691.34s -> 8703.48s]  it. I got it. Quick, quick, quick. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. No, I want to order a barbecue. I want
[8703.48s -> 8711.08s]  to order a sandwich. I can't have a barbecue. This is the barbecue place, right? What's going on?
[8711.08s -> 8727.35s]  Barbecue. Get rid of me. Fuck. Where are they going? Bill Banker said, what was that?
[8728.15s -> 8740.54s]  Bill, if you're not paying attention this entire time, where's the gold? My gold. I guess I have
[8740.54s -> 8748.06s]  to open up the reserves in the bunker. Wait, why does the sheriff not have a gun? The sheriff
[8748.06s -> 8776.74s]  doesn't have a gun. This is fucked up. I have to hide the car. These are the time police. Why are
[8776.82s -> 8786.70s]  they? They're not the time police. They're time agents. What are you talking about? They're
[8788.30s -> 8807.80s]  time agents? I'm so confused. Let me bully you. Wait, what?
[8812.95s -> 8822.31s]  Why did they kill that guy? What's happening? Why they're dressed like they're from this time
[8822.31s -> 8829.66s]  period. All right. I have to hide the car. I'm going to hide the car. I'm going to hide the car,
[8829.66s -> 8833.85s]  hide the car, hide the car. I thought that was an entire group of people coming to get me
[8834.87s -> 8840.71s]  that they are dressed with their have like they have bandit masks. What do you mean? They're time
[8841.35s -> 8877.70s]  agents. Get the car out of the way. Hide it. Okay, here we go. They're trying to blend in.
[8878.82s -> 8890.42s]  Okay, Bill Banker. What do you have? Buy a dollar for 210 coins. Buy 100 gold for 100. I can't even
[8890.42s -> 8909.10s]  look at that. My head hurts. Look at it. All right. Now I got to protect it. Fucking time agents.
[8910.06s -> 8920.20s]  They thought they were bank robbers. What time is it? All right. They'll be here any minute.
[8922.86s -> 8926.38s]  I don't know what time it is because my fucking car is over there in a ditch. So I don't know
[8926.38s -> 9004.65s]  what time it is. Okay, cool. All right. They're going to come in a minute. What is this game? The
[9004.65s -> 9012.71s]  game is called No Time. It is on Steam. It's early access. I think it's actually really fun.
[9012.71s -> 9019.30s]  I am confused about it a few times though. Once you get used to it. I think this is really cool.
[9019.30s -> 9035.13s]  This is a really great idea. All right. They should be coming any second now. Yep. Did they come?
[9035.13s -> 9052.97s]  From what direction did they come though? What a beautiful day. Bill Banker. What? Go, go, go.
[9052.97s -> 9082.28s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on? Why was he already in there? I need a
[9082.28s -> 9091.03s]  fucking gun. I'm so red. I'm so sick and fucking tired of waiting. I'm not waiting anymore. I'm
[9091.03s -> 9096.71s]  just getting in the car. No, get out now. Get out. I'm going. I don't care. Put me back. Take this
[9096.71s -> 9135.40s]  fucking thing out. Time agents. I'll show you how we're going to handle this. No, not 11. No, not
[9135.40s -> 9159.06s]  1150. You piece of shit. No, not March. Why can't I do 115? At this point it's already...
[9159.06s -> 9187.62s]  Just give me a fucking calendar. 03. 15. 1871. 0115. I don't care. I'm not waiting. I want to see if
[9187.62s -> 9204.54s]  this works actually. I'm testing something. It doesn't work. Fucking never mind. Reload the game.
[9204.54s -> 9209.82s]  Reload the game. Reload the game. I was trying to send it and just not even be in it.
[9228.66s -> 9238.98s]  Okay. How come the trunk is closed? All right. I guess the correct way to do this is to get a gun.
[9240.39s -> 9248.78s]  Right? We're going to find a job. The blacksmith pays well. Really? Wait, I can work there?
[9251.78s -> 9263.46s]  Need help? Grill steaks. Holy shit. Okay, cool. Prepare the steaks on the grill. Take an order.
[9264.10s -> 9269.54s]  I'll take a steak, please. What do you want?
[9286.55s -> 9295.64s]  What happened? Prepare the steaks on the grill. Once they're done,
[9296.20s -> 9303.94s]  put them on the plate and ring the bell. That's what I did. A steak, please. Yes. Okay. Here's
[9303.94s -> 9322.10s]  a steak. Why did the guy leave? What the fuck? What? Don't order food and fucking leave, dude.
[9323.06s -> 9338.97s]  The fucking bank. The bank, the bank, the bank, the bank, the bank.
[9344.78s -> 9377.40s]  All the time people are... Why is there no juice? Oh, because I didn't load it. I have to go back.
[9378.36s -> 9388.79s]  I got to go back. I got to go back here and I got to come back here like a day early.
[9389.43s -> 9401.78s]  I got to go back a day early. I can't be hit 15 minutes before it happens. I got to be here
[9401.78s -> 9409.26s]  like a few days early. Go and stop it potentially at the hideout. Why are you forcing yourself?
[9409.34s -> 9411.66s]  I'm not forcing myself to play this. I actually am having a good time.
[9413.67s -> 9421.98s]  You suck and this game sucks. Why don't you go rake some leaves then? What are you doing here?
[9422.78s -> 9428.60s]  Why don't you go rake some leaves? If you don't like the game and you don't like me,
[9429.40s -> 9433.46s]  what is keeping you here? Why don't you go fucking rake some leaves?
[9435.69s -> 9455.54s]  What do you want me to do for you? It's summer. So go rake some rocks. Okay. I am going to do
[9455.54s -> 9467.34s]  this mission. Dude, your stream sucks. This game sucks. My computer sucks. I have a virus on my
[9467.34s -> 9475.67s]  computer. Something smells in my room. Something smells in my room too. Oh, by the way, I ordered
[9475.67s -> 9478.47s]  something from Amazon. I didn't get here today. It was supposed to get here. I don't know, man.
[9478.47s -> 9497.21s]  What do you want me to say? Spray some air freshener in your room. Go play Scrabble.
[9497.77s -> 9505.38s]  All right. I have an idea. This game doesn't suck. You just don't have an IQ like I do to
[9505.38s -> 9518.42s]  understand it. Okay. March 14th, 1871 at 12 o'clock. This gives us plenty of opportunity
[9518.42s -> 9529.32s]  to make some stakes. We can make some money. I'm going to buy a gun and I'm going to stop
[9529.32s -> 9568.31s]  the robbery. Let's go for it. You ready? I am. We're here a day early. I have a day to get
[9568.31s -> 9575.05s]  enough money. I'm going to buy a gun and I'm going to be prepared this time. Sometimes you sound like
[9575.13s -> 9580.49s]  Peter Griffin. It's because Peter Griffin and I, Peter Griffin's a fictional character from
[9580.49s -> 9584.41s]  fictional New England. He has a fictional New England accent. Sometimes I have a New England
[9584.41s -> 9591.77s]  accent. I grew up there. So sorry. Me and Peter Griffin are from the same fucking area. I'm sorry.
[9591.77s -> 9601.03s]  I didn't. I'm sorry that I sound like Peter Griffin. I'm leaving that there. We're doing
[9601.03s -> 9624.55s]  this without the time. Hey, nobody asked for your life story. That's so stupid. Where are you from
[9624.55s -> 9635.86s]  in New England? It's from Rhode Island. It's called Kohog. It's like a small town. All right,
[9635.86s -> 9658.87s]  let's make some money. You look like a man that could use a stake. Can I help you? Anybody want
[9658.87s -> 9685.29s]  any food? Nobody's here. Do I have like all of my clothes on? Everyone's just sitting here looking
[9685.29s -> 9704.71s]  at me. What's, nobody hungry? All right. That was fun. All right. What about the blacksmith?
[9704.71s -> 9725.03s]  He might've bugged out. Actually something really important. Oh my God. I forgot. It's going to take
[9725.03s -> 9731.14s]  me a fucking whole day to go back to them. I didn't save it. I got to go back to the car.
[9734.09s -> 9763.46s]  Oh, I got to go back to the car. I will be, what's going on? What? I'm here a day early.
[9768.47s -> 9844.86s]  You fucking assholes. God, leave me alone. I didn't save it. Why can I kill them with a car?
[9864.23s -> 9872.41s]  I didn't save the game. I have no health. People were tougher back then, dude. How do I get rid
[9872.41s -> 9909.45s]  of these guys? You're doomed. Okay. At least the game is saved. I'm going to eat some food.
[9910.01s -> 9916.47s]  I don't know if they're going to follow me or not. Probably not. Okay. I have a save game.
[9916.47s -> 9931.10s]  Back to the town. Okay. Blacksmith. Can I do some work for the blacksmith?
[9931.98s -> 9940.62s]  I got to be able to eat, right? Yeah. Okay. Need help? Good luck. Your task is to craft
[9940.62s -> 9948.38s]  tools on demand. You'll get a guide with every new product. Okay. A woodcutter's axe, please.
[9949.18s -> 10001.66s]  You got it. Woodcutter's axe. Okay. And then you hit it with a hammer. Okay. And then this
[10002.97s -> 10030.38s]  goes into the water. Okay. And then this goes on a stick. I got it. Where's the customer? Nice.
[10030.38s -> 10040.12s]  All right. What do you want? Hammer, please. You got it. Hammer. Hilt. How do you make a hammer?
[10040.12s -> 10075.43s]  It's literally the same exact thing. Good. All right. Anybody else? Can I use an axe as a weapon?
[10075.43s -> 10092.07s]  Maybe I can. All right. Take a woodcutter's axe. And I... All right. Let's go. I made it with an axe
[10092.07s -> 10137.56s]  hilt. I don't know. Whatever. It's fine. Is it not ready? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. I'm gonna make
[10137.56s -> 10163.38s]  like 50 bucks. You made a block of cheese. Kind of. I'm running out of time. I got enough to do one
[10163.38s -> 10211.29s]  more. What do you want? Hurry up. Axe. Done. Go. Quick. What was wrong with it? What's going on?
[10211.29s -> 10240.89s]  Whatever. I'm making... I'm taking it. I'm making an axe myself. $65. Go get my gun. Who sells the
[10240.89s -> 10257.70s]  gun? The blacksmith sells the gun. All right. Buy bitcoin right now and cash it out in 300 years.
[10257.70s -> 10271.69s]  Okay. And I want the cowboy costume. That's too much money. All right. So now what do I do with
[10271.69s -> 10304.68s]  this? What am I supposed to do with this? How do I make it? Revolver parts. You have to build it?
[10304.68s -> 10322.14s]  How do you... How do I do that? I have to put it together? Put it together. Is there instructions?
[10322.14s -> 10339.75s]  Press the build button? I don't think there is a build button. Is it just junk? I don't think it's
[10339.83s -> 10353.93s]  junk. He's pretending. Dude, I got a box of junk on the ground. How am I supposed to turn this into a
[10353.93s -> 10375.11s]  gun? Is there a gunsmith? There might be. Not in this town. Unless the sheriff can do it. Maybe
[10375.11s -> 10391.70s]  talk to the blacksmith again. Press eight on the number pad. B. Eight does not do it. Can you make
[10391.70s -> 10410.04s]  anything with this? All this guy sells is props. Okay. Two and then three. Somebody has to be able
[10410.04s -> 10432.10s]  to put this together. All right. I've maybe I should bring it to a different time period.
[10432.10s -> 10445.08s]  Oh my god. Leave me alone. E doesn't do it either. It's definitely something I have to make.
[10445.08s -> 10456.52s]  I probably need a recipe or something. Yeah. Put it on the blacksmith's table.
[10478.71s -> 10485.48s]  Use the bossy. I don't know what that is. I don't think I can do anything with this yet.
[10485.48s -> 10518.94s]  I probably have to unlock it. Unless somebody else can make this into a gun. Okay. Do not travel to
[10518.94s -> 10534.44s]  666 AD. I don't even know where the car is, man. Do the main quest. Okay. Um, is crafting hidden?
[10534.44s -> 10543.70s]  Wait, so I can take this with me to and make it and then come back. Let me go in the car.
[10544.50s -> 10557.62s]  How far back and travel? You can go to 0001 AD. One AD. Jeremy, say hi to my grandma. She's 82 and
[10557.62s -> 10570.94s]  loves your streams. Um, hi grandma. All right. I'm gonna I'm giving this game like another 30 minutes
[10570.94s -> 10605.11s]  and we're gonna move on to something else. Hi grandma. Wait, is it what day is it? Do they
[10605.11s -> 10610.71s]  attack the bank right now? Go to the future where the gun is already built. All right. Hold on.
[10670.41s -> 10705.85s]  I don't have any more fuel. Okay. I need to reload. Was that way too dank? I'm sorry. Way
[10705.85s -> 10726.46s]  too dank. All right. You know, my favorite part about this game is this. I love the traveling
[10726.46s -> 10733.51s]  around. I want to find a good place to go. I'll do 2023. My brain is too small for this game. All
[10733.51s -> 10739.85s]  right. I'll be honest with you. See, for instance, I just tried to type in 15 for the month. There's
[10739.85s -> 10807.14s]  not a 15th month. Let's go. Wedged in somewhere. How did I go perfectly into a wedge? What the
[10807.14s -> 10829.42s]  hell is that? I can't, I don't think I can get in the car. All right. We're good. Headlights. Let's
[10829.42s -> 10854.90s]  go. So here's the donut shop. Are the aliens or something? What is in the road? Is that mine?
[10855.62s -> 10872.04s]  I'll take it, I guess. God, stop. Oh my fuck. I keep thinking it's a fucking monster.
[10872.60s -> 10919.02s]  What's going on these days? Watch out for the crabs. There we go. Okay. I want that. It's like
[10919.02s -> 10925.14s]  flying spaceships. Derma likes this game. I really do. I like the idea of this game a lot.
[10925.14s -> 10971.08s]  Was there a giant laser? What the hell is that? Is that the track? What is that? I'm investigating.
[10971.08s -> 10976.84s]  Don't read into it. He likes it. No, I think it's a really, really fun experience. I think it's a
[10976.84s -> 10990.31s]  really, really cool idea. And I commend the devs for trying something different. My brain just can't
[10990.31s -> 11008.47s]  handle going into like three places at the same time. Stop being so nice, Madge. Why? It takes a
[11008.47s -> 11025.34s]  lot of work. I'm still here playing it, aren't I? I want to know what the laser is. I'm going up
[11025.34s -> 11067.24s]  there. The flashlight. What the hell? All right. I'm going up to the laser. Drive up there. I mean,
[11068.20s -> 11081.29s]  you think I'm going to drive up this hill? That's not going to happen. Oh, there's a waterfall in
[11081.29s -> 11092.22s]  2020 AD. Oh, this is not a laser. This is a track. I'm going to find the laser beam. It's not what
[11092.22s -> 11125.91s]  I think it is. Very futuristic. This is 2023. All right. Now I'll do 9999, right? I will do the
[11125.91s -> 11138.26s]  coveted 9999. Oh, no, we can't. It stops at 2030. Right, right, right, right. All right. Well,
[11138.26s -> 11142.74s]  that was fun. That was a cool little game. We're going to move on. I just wanted to play it. I saw
[11142.74s -> 11147.93s]  it and I was going to play it. Whatever. I think it was really cool. I think it was fun. I think
[11147.93s -> 11151.77s]  it was interesting. There's a whole main quest line if you'd like to try it yourself. It's called
[11151.77s -> 11157.05s]  No Time. It's on Steam currently on Early Access. It seems like there's a lot of content in it so
[11157.05s -> 11167.59s]  far. That has been Checking It Out Thursdays. We're going to check out something else. Go back to
[11167.59s -> 11210.46s]  Wheel of Fortune. Whoa, what's this? Oh, it's a lighthouse. Okay. Maybe I should have got the car.
[11212.68s -> 11214.76s]  That does not hurt. That doesn't hurt.
[11218.60s -> 11223.99s]  Shit. All right. We're going to move on. I'm going to take a break. I'm going to pee. I'll be right
[11223.99s -> 11228.70s]  back. That was No Time. There's a lot in that game. If you want to check it out for yourself,
[11228.70s -> 11232.30s]  give it a go. I think that was a fun part of the stream. We're going to move on to part two,
[11232.94s -> 11236.94s]  which that's going to be. What would you like to know? I would too because I don't know.
[11236.94s -> 11369.46s]  I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back. We'll figure it out. See you guys in two minutes.
