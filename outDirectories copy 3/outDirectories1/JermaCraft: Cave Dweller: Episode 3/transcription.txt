[2.10s -> 7.40s]  Why, hello there. Welcome to another episode of Germacraft.
[7.40s -> 10.94s]  And as you can see, I'm doing a little bit of renovating.
[10.94s -> 17.21s]  Doing some renovations on the house, if you could tell, because this thing is a mess.
[17.21s -> 19.05s]  Just trying to clean it up a little bit.
[19.05s -> 22.01s]  And oh my god, no, this has happened before.
[22.81s -> 24.41s]  Don't worry, got it under control.
[26.68s -> 29.80s]  So I changed the brightness to be a little brighter.
[29.80s -> 35.40s]  And I also made the black bars on the sides of the video.
[35.40s -> 38.04s]  That's probably gone now, at least I'm hoping they are.
[38.04s -> 40.04s]  Because they were kind of annoying on the top and bottom.
[41.08s -> 42.68s]  So let's do some adventuring.
[42.68s -> 45.08s]  I already did a little bit of, I did some stuff before we started.
[45.80s -> 50.04s]  I got some torches, I got a couple of tools, got a little bit of iron.
[50.92s -> 52.92s]  And it's time to go on an adventure.
[54.01s -> 61.10s]  Iron sword, already got a shovel, got a pick, I got some rotten flesh.
[61.10s -> 62.22s]  I don't even know what this thing is.
[62.22s -> 63.82s]  What the hell is a slime ball?
[63.82s -> 64.54s]  What does that do?
[64.54s -> 66.49s]  I have no idea.
[68.62s -> 69.58s]  Let's get another pick.
[70.38s -> 72.49s]  Just because I know I'll probably need it.
[75.11s -> 77.83s]  Two shovels, a sword, a bunch of sticks.
[79.91s -> 82.66s]  I need to make, do I have enough?
[83.38s -> 84.42s]  I do not have enough.
[85.38s -> 92.71s]  Shoot, I think that'll be all right.
[92.71s -> 94.94s]  I got to get, I want to put this iron away.
[95.74s -> 97.62s]  All right, that's next on the agenda.
[97.62s -> 98.50s]  You know what, screw this.
[99.22s -> 100.42s]  I'm just taking it off the house.
[101.22s -> 108.47s]  I'm cutting down my preliminary wall so I can make a case.
[108.47s -> 110.39s]  So I don't lose all my items if I die.
[111.11s -> 113.43s]  Because that is a real big pain in the ass.
[114.15s -> 125.78s]  KKK, let's make, there it is.
[125.78s -> 128.34s]  A chest, a golden chest.
[129.06s -> 130.58s]  Put it right here.
[131.14s -> 133.98s]  Put half the coal in there, put the iron in there.
[134.70s -> 137.93s]  The slime ball and the sticks.
[139.34s -> 140.30s]  I got a bunch of sand.
[140.30s -> 141.42s]  What the hell am I going to do with that?
[142.87s -> 146.31s]  Okay, so now if I die, it's not a complete and total waste of time.
[147.54s -> 148.02s]  Let's go.
[150.25s -> 152.57s]  Try to find some kind of cave system here.
[153.21s -> 155.03s]  Because I had some iron from before.
[155.03s -> 156.39s]  I found a little bit of iron before.
[159.98s -> 160.46s]  Keep going.
[162.38s -> 163.18s]  We'll go this way now.
[163.18s -> 165.10s]  We'll dig, we'll dig straight this way.
[166.31s -> 168.95s]  You never know what you're going to run into in Germacraft.
[169.59s -> 172.02s]  Or Minecraft for that matter.
[174.87s -> 178.39s]  By the way, the music in this game is really, really good.
[179.61s -> 181.37s]  I, the composer's name is what?
[181.37s -> 182.97s]  Like C3, something like that.
[182.97s -> 184.89s]  It's some kind of crazy stage name he has.
[185.94s -> 186.90s]  He's a talented guy.
[187.46s -> 189.72s]  Because this stuff is really, really soothing.
[190.52s -> 191.64s]  He nailed it.
[191.64s -> 193.08s]  He absolutely nailed it.
[196.04s -> 196.76s]  Mine coal.
[198.74s -> 199.86s]  Mine coal.
[199.86s -> 204.38s]  We got to keep going forward and keep going below with the coal.
[206.34s -> 207.06s]  Mine steel.
[208.89s -> 209.61s]  Mine steel.
[210.17s -> 214.54s]  We got to mine that steel and mine that cobblestone.
[216.39s -> 218.23s]  Where the hell am I even going?
[218.23s -> 220.97s]  All right, let's go.
[220.97s -> 225.05s]  I will find something before this pick breaks.
[225.05s -> 227.06s]  Or it was, it'll kill me.
[230.25s -> 230.89s]  Oh yeah.
[231.61s -> 234.02s]  Aimlessly digging around.
[234.02s -> 237.88s]  Best part about Minecraft.
[237.88s -> 238.28s]  Torch.
[244.78s -> 246.06s]  Ooh, we found a little bit of coal.
[246.94s -> 247.66s]  That's good.
[248.22s -> 257.24s]  Ooh, I will definitely take you.
[257.88s -> 259.08s]  And you.
[259.08s -> 259.48s]  And you.
[260.41s -> 262.17s]  I'm going to give you all names too.
[262.17s -> 263.69s]  Your name's going to be Coley.
[264.78s -> 266.62s]  Your name's going to be Steamy.
[267.93s -> 272.02s]  And your name's going to be Diarrhea.
[272.02s -> 274.02s]  Because that's what you kind of look like.
[274.02s -> 277.14s]  Diarrhea.
[277.14s -> 278.26s]  Well, there's a lot of coal here.
[278.74s -> 281.50s]  Uh oh, I think I'm going to get lost.
[282.62s -> 284.22s]  I think I already am lost.
[287.11s -> 290.23s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we found gravel.
[290.23s -> 292.54s]  Which means...
[297.10s -> 299.96s]  All right, I want...
[299.96s -> 301.48s]  I don't know why I'm doing this.
[301.48s -> 301.96s]  Why?
[301.96s -> 303.80s]  All right, enough gravel.
[303.80s -> 305.72s]  We got a lava pit.
[306.36s -> 308.62s]  What else is in here?
[308.62s -> 310.84s]  Okay.
[310.84s -> 312.12s]  Ooh, that goes down.
[312.12s -> 313.72s]  I'm going to block this off.
[313.72s -> 317.02s]  This is really risky and I hope I don't die.
[320.07s -> 321.03s]  Ooh, okay.
[321.59s -> 322.31s]  Nice.
[322.31s -> 322.63s]  Nice.
[325.10s -> 326.38s]  And there goes the lava.
[326.38s -> 327.34s]  It is now disappearing.
[327.34s -> 328.38s]  Let's see if I can...
[328.38s -> 329.66s]  Ooh, I see iron.
[329.66s -> 330.54s]  I see iron.
[333.66s -> 335.18s]  I'm going to accidentally fall in this.
[335.18s -> 339.06s]  I know it.
[339.06s -> 340.58s]  I'm going to accidentally spill it.
[341.32s -> 343.80s]  Just like a hot cup of coffee on my new pair of pants.
[346.20s -> 347.56s]  All right, I think that should be good.
[350.79s -> 354.49s]  Give me that iron.
[354.49s -> 355.21s]  Only one?
[356.23s -> 358.15s]  There was only one thing of iron there.
[358.15s -> 359.03s]  You got to be kidding me.
[360.66s -> 362.10s]  I do not approve of that.
[362.10s -> 362.74s]  Yeah, right.
[363.46s -> 364.18s]  One iron.
[364.18s -> 365.30s]  How unlucky is that?
[367.06s -> 370.63s]  Yeah, well.
[370.63s -> 373.67s]  Ooh, there's even more.
[373.67s -> 376.02s]  I got a sword this time.
[376.02s -> 376.50s]  So you're...
[376.50s -> 377.70s]  Ooh, more iron.
[377.70s -> 383.51s]  Let me get this first.
[383.51s -> 386.55s]  All right, so this is a big intricate little cave system.
[386.55s -> 388.47s]  Big intricate little cave.
[388.47s -> 390.49s]  I like the sound of that.
[390.49s -> 391.61s]  Oh, hi there, guys.
[392.33s -> 394.25s]  You didn't think I had a sword this time, did you?
[396.17s -> 396.65s]  Goodbye.
[397.45s -> 398.73s]  And thanks for coming.
[399.37s -> 400.41s]  Oh, I don't think you understand.
[400.41s -> 401.61s]  I got a sword this time.
[401.61s -> 402.89s]  I'm not messing around anymore.
[402.89s -> 404.17s]  I'm hungry too, apparently.
[404.89s -> 405.45s]  You're dead.
[407.02s -> 407.66s]  What does he...
[407.66s -> 408.22s]  Is there lava?
[408.22s -> 410.20s]  He had his lava over there.
[410.20s -> 413.08s]  All right, I need to eat this rotten, disgusting flesh.
[413.08s -> 415.35s]  Hold on.
[415.35s -> 417.13s]  Can you puke in this game?
[417.13s -> 419.13s]  Because I would definitely puke from eating this.
[421.69s -> 422.41s]  Oh, like...
[422.41s -> 422.65s]  What?
[422.65s -> 423.69s]  What's going on?
[423.69s -> 425.18s]  What's going on?
[425.18s -> 426.14s]  Am I, like, toxic?
[426.14s -> 426.78s]  Am I going to die?
[427.86s -> 429.99s]  Oh, God.
[429.99s -> 431.27s]  This is great.
[431.27s -> 433.96s]  Now I have, like, toxic green blood.
[433.96s -> 437.26s]  Are you serious?
[437.26s -> 438.60s]  What the hell?
[438.60s -> 441.10s]  What are you doing?
[441.10s -> 442.94s]  Dude, you are, like, levitating right now.
[442.94s -> 444.06s]  Do you need some help with something?
[444.54s -> 445.02s]  Ha ha ha.
[446.89s -> 447.77s]  Yeah, you need some help.
[448.92s -> 449.64s]  Oh, okay.
[450.28s -> 451.40s]  I don't have any more picks, do I?
[451.40s -> 452.47s]  Nope.
[452.47s -> 455.38s]  Time to make the trek back.
[455.38s -> 456.90s]  Hopefully I can find my way.
[457.54s -> 458.26s]  Or else I am...
[461.05s -> 462.41s]  Look at this sneaky...
[462.41s -> 463.78s]  Whoa!
[463.78s -> 464.34s]  Okay, that...
[464.34s -> 465.14s]  Okay, really?
[465.14s -> 465.64s]  No!
[467.56s -> 468.06s]  Oh.
[468.98s -> 469.48s]  My.
[470.79s -> 472.70s]  God.
[472.70s -> 473.42s]  You have...
[474.06s -> 477.46s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[477.46s -> 478.58s]  That was...
[478.58s -> 481.26s]  How was that even possible?
[481.34s -> 483.74s]  There were two creepers sitting in, like, the same...
[484.38s -> 488.57s]  Exact spot together in the same pixel?
[488.57s -> 489.85s]  Oh, my God.
[492.60s -> 494.36s]  Oh, my God.
[497.94s -> 500.10s]  Look at this sneaky...
[500.10s -> 500.60s]  Whoa!
[502.50s -> 503.46s]  Okay, that...
[503.46s -> 504.42s]  Okay, really?
[504.42s -> 504.92s]  No!
