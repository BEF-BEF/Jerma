[0.57s -> 13.82s]  Hello. Good afternoon, everybody. EU stream. Well, it's a few hours early.
[13.82s -> 19.93s]  I have 1.30, 2.30, 3.34. Yeah, like two and a half hours early. There's a reason for it though.
[19.93s -> 26.54s]  I wanted to make sure I could get at least a solid three hours, four hours in today.
[26.54s -> 33.10s]  I got a lot of shit to do. I'm just running around in circles. And I mean that, dude,
[33.10s -> 37.38s]  I mean that quite literally. When the stream ends, I just, I still have a bunch of pent up energy and
[37.38s -> 46.17s]  I fucking just sprint in a circle for like 15 minutes and then I go to bed. You know how hard
[46.25s -> 53.10s]  it is to sprint in a circle? Have you guys ever tried that? Like a five, 10 foot circle?
[53.10s -> 65.43s]  Can you sprint in a circle? You can't. It's too hard. Like a 10 foot circle. No, no, you can't.
[65.43s -> 71.48s]  Did you drink your shower water again? No, I put it in my mouth and I spit it out.
[71.48s -> 79.88s]  Like every normal human on earth. But today, like I said, starting early because I want to make sure
[79.88s -> 84.49s]  I can stream for a few hours, we're going to play something that's going to take probably a few
[84.49s -> 89.59s]  hours. And that is, I mean, you guys are going to be really happy about this. Those of you that
[89.59s -> 96.33s]  weren't here over the last few days, I'm going to say this game and you're going to go, what the,
[96.33s -> 105.66s]  what? Ikaruga. Your speakers just went and like blew you away. Your like mouth is flapping back.
[105.66s -> 114.68s]  You can't fucking believe it. When I just said that word. Ikaruga is a shoot them up. It is a
[114.68s -> 123.13s]  bullet hell game and it's considered to be one of the best ever made. Now that's not according to me.
[123.13s -> 135.51s]  That's according to every single person I've ever known in my whole life. Now this is a pug. Yeah.
[135.51s -> 143.85s]  Play the real one. Touhou. All right. I'm going to have to be honest with you here.
[146.79s -> 154.82s]  All right. The, the more that people tell me to do something, you know, the less inclined I am to
[154.82s -> 165.06s]  actually do that thing, right? The more that people say, play this game, the more I go,
[165.06s -> 175.35s]  ah, maybe I don't want to do that. Like I've seen play Touhou even I'm talking like six months ago.
[175.35s -> 187.54s]  Just people just write it and that's like the only thing they write. Don't play Touhou. I mean,
[187.54s -> 197.18s]  maybe I will. I don't know. He hates us. Don't take your shirt off on stream. I don't, I don't
[197.18s -> 203.54s]  think I'll be doing that one. I don't plan on that one, but anyways, let's go. I'm going to play
[203.54s -> 215.56s]  Ikaruga. It looks fucking awesome. It looks so good. I looked at it and I was like, wow,
[216.28s -> 219.93s]  this one's going to be a good one. Let's take a look. What do you think?
[222.71s -> 229.74s]  Already the menu is clean. Is this, is this, is this loud? You tell me this is loud. Okay.
[232.65s -> 243.80s]  Why do you say, oh no. Somebody said, oh no. Why? Oh no. This doesn't have blood. No,
[243.80s -> 248.74s]  but it's got explosions. All right. All right. As long as it got explosions and you got,
[248.74s -> 253.96s]  that's fine. Count me in. You're going to be digging a hole in this one? No, no, I promise.
[253.96s -> 260.49s]  Okay. Thank God. Last like six streams have been you digging holes, bro. No, I promised there'll be
[260.49s -> 276.63s]  explosions. Okay. Better be. All right. Select with the stick. Decide with the button. This is a
[276.63s -> 282.30s]  little loud for me. All right. Arcade mode, the default arcade mode, prototype mode has the limit
[282.30s -> 289.43s]  of the shots. Chapter select, select the level to play. Let's just do arcade mode, right?
[292.12s -> 297.82s]  We can try the other modes later. This has got to be turned down by the way. All right.
[297.82s -> 313.66s]  There's three difficulties. It's easy, normal, and hard. Whoa. What just happened? Why did that
[313.66s -> 318.94s]  just do that? What was that? I didn't even hear that. I just saw that. I saw the, I saw the audio
[318.94s -> 324.78s]  go up to like a thousand. What happened? Oh, you're going to get blown away. You're going to get
[324.78s -> 331.98s]  blown away when I say the words Ikarunga and your face is going to be flapping. I'm sorry. I didn't
[331.98s -> 337.46s]  mean, I don't know what happened. I didn't do anything. Okay. Please don't do that again.
[339.46s -> 343.30s]  The fuck are you doing? I didn't do anything. I just was like changing the audio level over
[343.30s -> 347.94s]  here. I didn't do anything. All right. Enemies with the same polarity return fire. That sounds
[347.94s -> 355.58s]  like fun. All right. Enemies. I mean, let me try a normal first. What a fucking professional streamer.
[355.58s -> 361.90s]  It, it did that on its own. I didn't do anything. I'm doing normal first. I will not die until I
[361.90s -> 368.70s]  achieve something. Even though the ideal, I didn't read that. Don't you know not to use
[368.70s -> 378.81s]  fucking vertical video? How do I move? The move. Oh, it's WASD. All right. WASD. I'm already dead.
[378.81s -> 386.18s]  All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm dead again. All right. Chapter one.
[388.58s -> 395.56s]  I can't even read that. It's too fast. There's like, you have to switch polarity in this game.
[396.52s -> 402.76s]  You can absorb bullets if you're the same polarity. You, I looked at the fucking instructions before
[402.76s -> 409.32s]  we played. If you absorb bullets of the same polarity, listen to me, then you can do extra
[409.32s -> 414.36s]  damage. For instance, see if there's white and black, black and white. That's it. I'm dead again
[414.36s -> 422.78s]  and I lose. All right. Cool. Well, uh, we'll get, all right, let's go. Now uploading the replay.
[422.78s -> 431.96s]  Don't upload the fucking replay. I don't want someone to up see that replay. What do you mean
[431.96s -> 436.68s]  upload the replay? No, I don't want to upload a fucking replay. All right. So that's how it works.
[438.76s -> 442.68s]  It's games considered one of the hardest games ever made too. Just, I forgot to mention that.
[442.68s -> 448.02s]  I didn't even know what the buttons were. All right. Let me explain. Let's do some explanations
[448.02s -> 460.28s]  here. Thank God there's no replay. Thank God. Wait.
[489.37s -> 497.54s]  You get three lives. Okay. You get three lives and after you die three times, it's over. But
[497.54s -> 504.73s]  this polarity, as you see, the game's fucking fantastic. You have to absorb bullets of the
[504.73s -> 512.39s]  same polarity as you see in this replay. Check that out. See black goes into black and then
[512.39s -> 522.57s]  as you see, wait, what's wrong? Okay. What are you doing? All right. That one's done. He's not even
[522.57s -> 528.87s]  actually playing. No, I'm just watching a cool replay. All right. Let me try this again. We've
[528.87s -> 537.53s]  got to get through. And you guys want me to play on hard. Have you lost your mind? You want me to
[537.53s -> 544.87s]  play on hard. This is an actual fake. That was real gameplay that I previously, that was previously
[544.87s -> 551.82s]  recorded gameplay. Let Otto play the game. All right. Let's try this again. So remember polarity
[552.46s -> 555.98s]  is important. Let's see if I can do. I didn't even know W. I thought it was move with the mouse.
[556.86s -> 571.27s]  You do double damage to people of this, of the opposite polarity. Oh, this is pretty sick
[571.27s -> 576.36s]  actually. All right. And then I can do a super move. If I press mouse four, I can shoot out homing
[576.36s -> 595.34s]  missiles. Can you hear me? Can you guys hear me? Just don't run into anybody. Watch out. You can
[595.34s -> 607.59s]  get a, if you get three people in a row, you get a chain by the way. Like that. I have two chains.
[607.59s -> 620.46s]  Okay. Cool. Wait. Oh dear God. All right. Kill the, kill the one on the right first. Double damage,
[620.46s -> 634.95s]  right? Holy shit. That was actually really cool. Fuck. Sorry. I got three lives. I'm all right.
[635.75s -> 643.27s]  After this, I'm going to have to see what's going on with Otto. He wants to get out.
[643.27s -> 650.04s]  Absorb that whole thing. Whoa. Is that going to hit me if they go from behind there?
[651.00s -> 657.32s]  Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I've changed. Oh my God. Change polarity again. I can absorb. Oh,
[657.32s -> 668.71s]  fuck. Oh my God. What do I do? It's so confusing, but it's actually really cool.
[669.59s -> 682.12s]  I have to hit them. I didn't kill them. Wait, this is, am I the boss? But this is on normal
[682.12s -> 696.94s]  difficulty. I have one health. Is he white? Yep. Oh man. Fuck. God. All right. Hold on. I think
[696.94s -> 759.59s]  Otto needs to go outside. I'll be right back. He's okay. He's, he's starting to get nervous
[761.08s -> 768.70s]  because of the boxes. If you ever move with a dog before, they start to see you pack up shit
[769.34s -> 773.67s]  and they, they don't like it. They're like, let's go. What are you doing? Like, why are you doing
[773.67s -> 781.35s]  that? Oh, this is, this is my house. Where are we going? We're trying to make it as easy as a
[781.35s -> 794.97s]  process as possible, but he's okay. It's true. All right. In the meantime, let's go back here.
[796.22s -> 804.76s]  I'm going to get into this fucking game. I'm not saving the replay. Why am I stealing from Otto?
[812.36s -> 816.04s]  Forget the link. He's going to play. Yeah. Forget the link. I'll click on it an hour.
[821.27s -> 825.03s]  Jeremy, you're going to finish Odama today. All right. Start banning people
[825.03s -> 840.20s]  that say the word Odama for like four days. Shit restart. I switched polarity in the wrong,
[840.20s -> 857.90s]  the wrong time. What's the story of this game? You're going to ban the entire chat. Yeah, I know.
[858.94s -> 866.14s]  All right. Four chain. I got four chain. All right. I get it. I get it.
[866.94s -> 880.86s]  Mods don't care. What are you, why are you doing that? Go back to four. Oh, I see.
[883.91s -> 889.30s]  I got to absorb. Okay. I have max energy right now. Who the fuck is calling me?
[891.06s -> 938.97s]  What the hell? Is that a lot of stream time? Hold on. Don't, I don't want to save fucking 10% on my,
[938.97s -> 956.47s]  on my fucking car insurance. Okay. Jesus. God. That's a good deal though. Should I call them back?
[957.11s -> 969.24s]  Do I give them a, do I ring them back? I give her the, you gotta do, you gotta do polarity switching
[969.24s -> 978.36s]  like this. Bang. Like that. Get it again. Absorb. Oh my God. What did I do? I'm a fucking idiot.
[978.36s -> 988.63s]  I'm okay. I'm okay. I got full energy. How much did I use this? It's, it's all homing missiles,
[988.63s -> 998.52s]  by the way. All right. This part fucked me up last time. Get rid of the right, the right one.
[999.40s -> 1012.49s]  Good. Absorb it all. Switch to other polarity. Right there. Bingo. Fuck. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[1012.49s -> 1027.29s]  Oh my God. I'm, I'm so dead. Eat, eat, eat, eat. All right. Here's the boss. I have two health.
[1027.29s -> 1037.00s]  I think I'll be okay. That was hard. Should I switch? I don't know. He has a black shield.
[1037.96s -> 1059.02s]  Eat the whole thing. Oh, I get it. Okay. I can. Fuck. God damn it. I get it. Yeah. Okay. Now what?
[1059.58s -> 1077.35s]  She's, what's she switching to? Sir, are you sure? Sure. We have a one day deal. Why is today the day?
[1078.15s -> 1083.66s]  Just in case you want to take us up on our offer. 40% off the whole store. You know that Mr. Jeremy
[1083.66s -> 1094.17s]  Albertson. Fuck. I'm okay. Oh my God. All right. I'm going to throw, I'm going to, I'm going to
[1094.17s -> 1103.66s]  fucking throw my phone into the toilet in a second. I swear to God. Hey, they can't call you if your
[1103.66s -> 1119.38s]  phone's in the toilet. You know, that's thinking face. God damn it. This is fucking hard. I'm turning
[1119.38s -> 1142.22s]  my phone on silent. He thinks this is hard. I'll get there. Wait, we're 30 minutes into the stream
[1142.22s -> 1149.32s]  we're already on phone in toilet stage. Well, no, not because of the game, because people keep
[1149.32s -> 1156.73s]  fucking calling my phone. I didn't say I want to put my computer into the toilet because that would
[1156.73s -> 1172.89s]  be sufficient if I was angry with the game. All right. Take that, take that, switch around. All
[1172.89s -> 1180.10s]  right. Let's go. Double fucking damn it. This is a phone game though. This is not, this is,
[1181.22s -> 1187.90s]  I mean, it's, it is as big. All right. Whatever. This is a hyper pay attention video game. I'm
[1187.90s -> 1202.20s]  going to just lock in. I got max energy. I got to save this. Let's do it. You know,
[1202.20s -> 1220.47s]  you can just keep doing it. Watch that polarity shift. I gotta, I gotta become like a, like an
[1220.47s -> 1234.66s]  actual gamer here. You know what I mean? You're, it takes like a lot for your brain to understand
[1234.66s -> 1241.75s]  and process that you can, you should run into bullets. You know what I'm saying? My brain is
[1241.75s -> 1251.21s]  like, don't run into those bullets. But my, I'm like, yes, you have to. There we go. Right side.
[1253.58s -> 1263.48s]  Wow. Same thing happened last time.
[1267.58s -> 1281.62s]  It's okay. Just don't panic. Oh fuck. Okay. Here we go. I'm at the boss again. Just be careful.
[1283.64s -> 1288.62s]  Kill the things on the left and right. He's got those two orbiters.
[1289.34s -> 1299.43s]  Do that health. Get rid of it. Good. Come on. Move, move, move, move, move. Don't get hit.
[1300.15s -> 1311.50s]  Don't be a fucking dope. God, this game's like Binding of Isaac. Okay. Shut up. Do that one.
[1312.30s -> 1318.68s]  All right. Now what do we switch to? Oh, all right. Now they switched the polarity shifted.
[1318.68s -> 1322.92s]  I get it. All right. Now they're different. They're different. Oh fuck. Okay. I need to be quiet.
[1323.72s -> 1382.79s]  Stop being like a tuber in play. Oh shit. Yeah. Got him. Got him. Did I get him?
[1392.54s -> 1400.94s]  That was actually really hard. I can, it's whatever. What are we on level two? All right.
[1400.94s -> 1419.27s]  Let's do it. Oh, they fly into you and shit now. Oh man. Damn it. Game over. All right. Do I get
[1419.27s -> 1437.96s]  started level two? Yeah. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Because he didn't think so. I want to watch him
[1437.96s -> 1451.58s]  suffer. I'm only on level two guys. Okay. Arcade mode. Chapter two. Unnormal. This ain't chapter
[1451.58s -> 1465.88s]  two. What the fuck? Why is this supposed to be chapter two? Arcade starts from the beginning.
[1465.88s -> 1474.79s]  Oh, all right. All right. Well, see if I can just do this. So what do I have to select? Just the
[1474.79s -> 1496.74s]  other one. This, I just have to do chapter mode. Oh, this is good practice. Good practice. I like,
[1496.74s -> 1514.76s]  I like practice. Oops. All right. That was good practice. All right. Chapter select. Please select
[1514.76s -> 1522.33s]  gateway. Chapter one. No. Chapter two. There we go. This is like, this one's called trial.
[1523.67s -> 1528.36s]  Enemies with the same polarity return fire. Yeah, that's fine. Here we go. Let's do it.
[1529.16s -> 1546.06s]  Return continues on. I could do that. Are people going to think I'm a cheater? Holy shit.
[1547.18s -> 1560.74s]  This is fucking crazy. Take it all. Absorb the whole thing. All right. I got to switch polarity
[1560.74s -> 1574.78s]  here. I'm on the same one. Put a black. Why is he not playing afterburner? I don't know. I'm
[1574.78s -> 1585.93s]  playing Ikaruga. This shit is so loud still. Hold on. You got to kid me right when I switched.
[1585.93s -> 1596.07s]  Fuck. That's annoying. God damn it. Fuck. That's crazy. Okay. You got to do it immediately. I got
[1596.07s -> 1627.82s]  to turn the game down. Am I going to play at a Hulk at some point? Yes. How many chapters are there
[1627.82s -> 1639.05s]  in the game? Oh my God. I try to get so fancy. Fuck. All right. Do it again. Call me restart
[1639.05s -> 1663.22s]  rainy. That's fine. I don't care. The bosses are the most interesting thing to me. Jesus, man.
[1664.20s -> 1683.72s]  Oh, fuck. It's so erratic. I should have gotten hit like five times by now. Take them out. Take
[1683.72s -> 1705.26s]  them out. Take them out. All right. What a bad place to lose the life. Use more magic. All right.
[1705.26s -> 1716.98s]  This is where it gets funky. All right. Here we go. Jesus. I have to go through them, I guess.
[1728.68s -> 1743.74s]  Oh, man. Oh, man. What do I do? Okay. Wait, is that open? Open. Open. Open, please. Open. Oh,
[1743.74s -> 1773.16s]  man. Oh, I'm going to get crushed. Holy shit. I like cheated. How did I cheat and win? Oh, man.
[1773.16s -> 1780.70s]  Oh, it's too much. It's too much for me to do. It's too much for me to do, I think.
[1780.70s -> 1807.51s]  This is too much for my brain to do. I get fucking hit by that. Oh, shit.
[1811.51s -> 1817.27s]  I'm going to die. I'm going to die here. This is where I die. This is how it ends for me. I'm
[1817.27s -> 1836.50s]  going to just, I'm going to explode. Okay. I have to beat a boss too. No, man. This is too much.
[1836.50s -> 1848.39s]  I need to put continues on. I got to put on continues, dude. Oh, shit. Fucking my God.
[1853.40s -> 1857.72s]  I can't believe I made it through that. I don't have any, I have no idea how that happened.
[1862.36s -> 1871.38s]  Okay. Weak point. What? Hit those wings? What do I have to do? Open up the fucking crevice?
[1872.18s -> 1898.20s]  I think I have to bring both of his head down. Oh, this is doing this. What does this have to do?
[1899.77s -> 1927.11s]  What does this have to do? I can't even speak. Holy shit. That's insane. That's hard as wow.
[1927.11s -> 1938.42s]  Okay. I'm going to turn on continues. Turn on continues. Yeah. When continues on,
[1938.42s -> 1949.06s]  replays cannot. Three continues. How many continues? How about like two continues?
[1951.27s -> 1962.65s]  One continue. That's all you're going to let me have here is a one continue. I'll try it with one.
[1962.65s -> 1970.14s]  Look, this is an arcade game. Back in the day, I would just have to put 25 more cents in.
[1972.73s -> 1981.93s]  By the way, Red Lemonade gave five community subs. Thank you, Red Lemonade. What's wrong?
[1981.93s -> 1990.65s]  The default setting has changed. High scores will not be saved. Wait. People want me to click
[1990.65s -> 2001.80s]  on this image very badly. Let's, okay. I'll give it to you. What is this? Why is this like,
[2003.50s -> 2025.82s]  did you, did you copy and paste a book and put it down one strip? Okay. Play. I couldn't even see
[2025.82s -> 2037.69s]  until I zoomed in. You should take his advice. How many credits do I have? All right. That shit
[2037.69s -> 2050.42s]  is fucking hard, man. All right. Let's try this again. This is fun though. Fun, but hard. Fun,
[2050.42s -> 2077.74s]  but hard. Fuck you. I was a good start too. See how I need those continues. Just saved that.
[2081.77s -> 2087.45s]  Damn it. And that's not even the beginning of the level. Gift a sub per continue.
[2088.97s -> 2097.99s]  Um, I'm sorry guys. It didn't cost $5 to continue in the arcade. You didn't slide
[2097.99s -> 2121.26s]  a $5 bill into a machine. I gotta pay attention here. All right. And go, and go.
[2124.92s -> 2127.64s]  Same shit I did last time. Remember I was, hey, remember last time I was going,
[2134.92s -> 2150.49s]  not this time. I was, why was I looking at chat? Why was I looking at the chat? What am I doing?
[2151.29s -> 2164.97s]  I wasn't even looking at the game. I was looking over you guys. Why am I doing that for? Start.
[2164.97s -> 2178.70s]  What's the start button? What's the start button? What? Left click, right click, enter.
[2179.50s -> 2207.19s]  It's not enter. Mouse three. It's okay. It's middle mouse button. All right. Let's go.
[2207.75s -> 2214.98s]  You're playing with a mouse? Should I not be? Is this like playing Dark Souls with a mouse?
[2214.98s -> 2225.45s]  Is that a bad idea? Should I not be doing this? Use a controller. What? Is this dumb?
[2226.17s -> 2252.07s]  This is dumb. Okay. I'll put my controller in. Is it dumb? Is it dumb? Wait a minute. Um,
[2252.07s -> 2265.61s]  guys, I don't think a controller can be used. Why is my Xbox controller not getting recognized?
[2269.32s -> 2275.40s]  I have my Xbox One controller plugged in. Let me try it with the controller. See if it's any
[2275.40s -> 2288.01s]  better. Use the arrow keys. How is the arrow keys different than WASD? It's the same thing. It's just
[2288.01s -> 2306.70s]  more over to the right. Let me try with the controller. All right. Here we go.
[2306.70s -> 2319.82s]  They reached the CPU slightly faster. What? That's absolute horseshit, right? That's not real.
[2322.10s -> 2328.92s]  No, right? Is that real? Okay. No, turn off vibration for the love of God. All right. How
[2328.92s -> 2336.71s]  do I do the... Okay. Let's do... Yeah. I don't know what the... What are the controls though?
[2338.86s -> 2348.49s]  Okay. A is fire. Flarity is B. Okay. Release power is right trigger. All right. That makes sense.
[2349.13s -> 2355.72s]  That is kind of true. How is that true? Isn't the keyboard just... I'm not going to pretend
[2355.72s -> 2361.62s]  to believe that. If you had a keyboard with a PS2 connector, it would be faster.
[2366.65s -> 2381.38s]  I don't believe a word you guys are saying right now. Uh, it's... Okay. It actually is a little
[2381.38s -> 2411.69s]  easier. Probably a little bit. Absorb. Absorb. Is it activated? Not yet. Not yet. This is riveting
[2411.69s -> 2419.74s]  resident sleeper. Don't worry. Hey, we'll wake you up. We'll wake you up in a few hours. Have a nice
[2419.74s -> 2435.02s]  rest. All right. Now watch out here. There we go. Fuck. There's another wave. All right. Good. Good.
[2437.27s -> 2452.60s]  Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Now we go like this. Fuck. Okay. I'm fine. Same deal. I'm
[2452.60s -> 2470.52s]  going to go up that left side. All right. Easy. Slow down. You absorb that. Then I think it's... Is
[2470.52s -> 2480.09s]  it black? Yep. Black. Is it white again? I think so. All right. We're good. Now is where I have to
[2480.09s -> 2491.06s]  be... I got a full charge here. What the fuck? Did you see that shit come out of nowhere?
[2496.79s -> 2517.03s]  Damn it. I just got to stay back. Fuck. God damn it. Shit. Oh, it's so... Your brain just doesn't
[2517.03s -> 2527.18s]  want to do it. It's just confused. It's like scratching your head and patting your ass.
[2527.74s -> 2546.92s]  Whatever that saying is. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Fuck you.
[2547.88s -> 2572.44s]  All right. Here we go. I have one health. Take it all. All right. Good. All right. Let's go.
[2572.44s -> 2577.03s]  He's angry. No, I'm not. I'm frustrated. It's different. Okay. So now this one,
[2577.03s -> 2583.82s]  you got to get the middle. You got to get right there in the center.
[2608.20s -> 2649.06s]  Ay caramba. What's coming out first? Oh, my God. Oh, I don't get it. I don't understand. I don't
[2649.06s -> 2659.83s]  get it. You already get it? Do they have to be out extended all the way before I can hurt it?
[2659.83s -> 2682.76s]  Or this is hitting it, I guess. Oh, okay. So I have to fly inside. I don't understand.
[2682.76s -> 2694.22s]  You got to get in there. I got to fly inside the tubes. Oh, so what? Okay. Is that... Will
[2694.22s -> 2708.81s]  that damage me if I'm the wrong polarity at all? All right. This time I got to be careful.
[2708.81s -> 2735.66s]  There we go. Those homing missiles are so good. All right. I got this first part down pretty well.
[2735.66s -> 2751.06s]  That should be good. All right. How long do you think he's going to play this game? The whole
[2751.06s -> 2756.10s]  stream or just another hour maybe? Well, it depends on how I can even complete it or not.
[2756.10s -> 2788.98s]  We'll find out. Fuck. I blew it. All right. Oh, shit. What the hell am I doing? Oh, interesting
[2788.98s -> 2795.94s]  to note. From every steam discussion and review of this game that I've read, most people don't
[2795.94s -> 2801.88s]  beat this level. They go, I've done it after this level two and I can't do it. Just want to make
[2801.88s -> 2811.77s]  that very clear from what I've read. It's level two, which this is level two. I don't want to
[2811.77s -> 2822.12s]  write a steam review about it. It's fun, but I can't get past level two. Stay the fuck back.
[2822.12s -> 2832.34s]  Forget about points. Just stay alive. Oh my fucking God. What have I done? Why did I kill
[2832.34s -> 2857.91s]  that thing? I should have just left it alive. Jesus. Okay. Go this way. Right? I don't know.
[2860.71s -> 2885.46s]  Fuck. I'm freaking out, man. Just make it. Stay away from me, please. All right. Let's go.
[2886.10s -> 2909.13s]  I need some shit. Absorb that. All right. Come on. I want max. All right. I got pretty much max.
[2909.61s -> 2914.41s]  11 homing missiles. You got to get in there, man. All right. I know. I got to get in there,
[2914.41s -> 2943.83s]  man. Get in there. I'll get in there. I got one shot. What am I thinking? Oh my God. Okay. Get
[2943.83s -> 2985.16s]  in there, man. Get in there. Give me that shit. Hold on. Slow it down. Okay. Eat this. That's so
[2985.16s -> 2995.80s]  fucking hard. Fuck. Oh, God damn it. Yeah. I thought Icaruga was a really fun game,
[2995.80s -> 3011.54s]  but unfortunately, I couldn't get past chapter two. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll
[3011.54s -> 3028.79s]  get it. Charge. Charge it up. Restart. Restart. Restart. Hold on. Somebody gave $50. Hold on a
[3028.79s -> 3036.25s]  second. I just got 5,000 bits right now. That's huge. I'll take a fucking explosion, a ship
[3036.25s -> 3045.45s]  explosion over that one. It's from Cab Badger. This is nice journalist gameplay. I bet you you
[3045.45s -> 3052.02s]  couldn't beat this in 10 minutes. I bet you one fake germa sent that you couldn't beat level two
[3052.02s -> 3060.25s]  in 10 minutes. How's that sound? Who's the real, who's the journalist here? Anyways, if you want
[3060.25s -> 3066.66s]  to play, if you want to play, play a shmup, please play Zero Ranger. The game is absurdly underrated.
[3066.66s -> 3071.06s]  It's an excellent entry point for newcomers. While Icaruga is one of the great shmups of its time,
[3071.06s -> 3076.74s]  it requires a whole lot of playthroughs in order to fully understand it. It's arguably harder than
[3076.74s -> 3082.41s]  most Touhou games on arcade mode. Zero Ranger is an excellent starting point and is sure to be a
[3082.41s -> 3086.81s]  crowd pleaser for chat. By the way, you can give yourself infinite lives in the options menu,
[3086.81s -> 3096.78s]  which is fine. I love this. I love this comment. I love this bit message because it's fine.
[3096.78s -> 3104.54s]  That's fine. It's okay. I can do two continues. Really appreciate it. Thank you for the $50.
[3104.54s -> 3113.61s]  Seriously, thank you for the 5,000 fucking bits. You know what? I actually really do like these
[3113.61s -> 3121.29s]  kinds of games. I can get into them pretty easily. So you probably would see a few more of these.
[3121.29s -> 3125.69s]  I mean, I'm bonding of Isaac's one of my favorite games. I know, I know. Yeah, everything's running
[3125.69s -> 3136.65s]  of Isaac to Gerba. But I mean, it's, it's dodging and shooting and we'll see. Let's see if I can
[3136.65s -> 3139.53s]  get through the hard one. If I can get through the hard one, then everything is, it's, it's just
[3139.53s -> 3145.64s]  like coasting at that point, right? All right. Hold on. Let me, let me, let's do that again.
[3145.64s -> 3157.66s]  That was fucking pathetic. This is level two. Yeah. This is the one that people get stuck on.
[3159.13s -> 3162.25s]  I'm, I'm, I'm going hard. I'm, I'm going to try to beat this today.
[3163.05s -> 3173.05s]  Guys, the time to beat, if you know what you're doing, is like an hour. There's only like five
[3173.05s -> 3181.94s]  stages in this game, but they're all just like super tricky. I almost blew that. That would have
[3181.94s -> 3203.21s]  been bad. Absorb. But I want to take, all right. Got two lives. Oak waiting room. All right. Have
[3203.21s -> 3210.30s]  you guys noticed that like, there's always apparently a waiting room for another game.
[3210.30s -> 3215.10s]  You know what I mean? It's like Ikaruga waiting room, like three days ago. Animal Crossing waiting
[3215.10s -> 3219.26s]  room. And then I played it. Oh, Viva Pinata waiting room. And then I played, it doesn't mean
[3219.26s -> 3231.64s]  like you take a number. Oh, I can't believe it. Where's Viva Pinata? He's playing Viva Pinata
[3231.64s -> 3238.68s]  now. Get this game out. This game sucks. Where's Ikaruga? Oh, Ikaruga. Ikaruga waiting room.
[3238.68s -> 3243.54s]  Oh, here's Ikaruga. This game's stupid. When are you going to play Hulk? Hulk waiting room.
[3244.34s -> 3249.16s]  Oh, I'm going to play Hulk now. This game's dumb. Uh, fucking Mario 2 waiting room.
[3253.27s -> 3266.73s]  There's not much room in the waiting room. Next level waiting room. Get out of here with that.
[3266.73s -> 3276.41s]  I'm going to beat this. It's this part right here. This is the tricky one. Just stay the
[3276.41s -> 3303.82s]  fuck back. I just forgot how to change polarity. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. I forgot what I'm
[3303.82s -> 3322.98s]  doing. Oh, fuck. Oh, that sucks. All right. Okay. Eat him up. Eat him up. Eat him up. Eat him up.
[3322.98s -> 3338.86s]  Eat him up. And eat him up. And, and, and, and go. And then eat him up. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[3338.86s -> 3342.14s]  All right. I've got, look at how much I got plenty of time. I got plenty of health.
[3350.09s -> 3357.29s]  Come on. What the fuck are you thinking? I'm so mad. I'm actually pissed off at myself right
[3357.29s -> 3362.89s]  now. I'm fucking furious right now. I'm so furious. I am so angry. You can't even tell.
[3363.45s -> 3372.30s]  Yes, you can. Okay. Get the, I got like fucking three lives for this shit. He's seething. I got
[3372.30s -> 3392.60s]  it. I got to beat level two. I have a question. So when I dodge like that, does it, I'll ask it
[3392.60s -> 3428.62s]  later. Do I have a frame invincibility on that shit? Holy fuck. Come on. Fire it. Oh, you idiot.
[3429.34s -> 3457.13s]  Come on. Just give me a chance. It's firing at me. Oh my God. What happened? Oh, I hit the back.
[3457.13s -> 3475.93s]  It's okay. Oh my fucking God. I have a question. Oh my, I thought I was going to die if I went in
[3475.93s -> 3491.98s]  there with this. I ran out of time. I don't know. I, I didn't, I thought it was a, I thought it was
[3491.98s -> 3495.50s]  like a fucking, like a beam or something. Like if I went in there, it was going to kill me.
[3495.50s -> 3507.96s]  If I was the other polarity, I figured that because I didn't know, I thought if I walked
[3507.96s -> 3512.17s]  in there, it was like, you're going to kill me. All right. Now that, that makes this way easier.
[3512.17s -> 3527.64s]  No, not easier, but you know, this game's fucking good. I like this. So those, okay. I've actually,
[3527.64s -> 3532.54s]  a actual question. Is this considered one of the harder shoot them ups that have come out?
[3533.26s -> 3538.55s]  Is it like, just be real with me. Is that real? I want to know if I'm going up against like the
[3538.55s -> 3557.32s]  hardest. Yup. Yup. All right. Good. Good. That's how I want it. Treasure games are regarded very
[3557.32s -> 3563.42s]  difficult. Yeah. I'll get this. I'm not going to do it on hard, but you know, I'll do it with one
[3563.42s -> 3570.02s]  continue. You literally ignored 70% of chat. Well, 70, 70% of you fucking guys just making shit up.
[3571.16s -> 3577.90s]  70% of you guys probably have never heard of this game until 12 minutes ago. So, uh, sorry.
[3577.98s -> 3601.02s]  Excuse me. Oh no. He knows. Of course I know. Oh shit. You know. Oh my God. Why the fuck? All
[3601.02s -> 3615.69s]  right. No more reading chat ever again. Just wasting lives for no reason. Kill, kill, kill,
[3616.65s -> 3627.03s]  swim, kill, kill, kill, swim. There are probably people that fly all around the edges here and
[3627.03s -> 3635.30s]  kill everything. I think that's not me. I gotta be careful again. Just don't fuck it up. Don't be an
[3635.30s -> 3672.42s]  idiot. Yo. All right. This part always fucks me up. It's just, just go forward. Don't worry
[3672.42s -> 3684.30s]  about anything. Just get up there. I don't do shit. This just to go now. I'm too high strung
[3684.30s -> 3698.38s]  for this shit. I really am. I know I should be switching polarity and yeah, yeah, yeah, but
[3698.38s -> 3726.17s]  whatever. Holy fuck. All right. Same deal. Let's go. I got it this time. I got plenty in lives,
[3726.17s -> 3733.48s]  plenty of health. I'm ready. Let's fucking go. If you think I'm going to click on a website
[3733.48s -> 3764.98s]  that's dot free in the title, you're fucking crazy. All right. Same deal. Holy fuck. You like
[3764.98s -> 3809.69s]  that shit? You like that shit? Oops. There it is, right? No. God damn it. Please. I already
[3809.69s -> 3826.34s]  got so good. Shit in my pants, man. Shit in my mouth. Fuck. Don't say that. I got it. I just
[3826.34s -> 3830.82s]  won. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I beat level two. I beat level
[3830.82s -> 3856.20s]  two. I don't have to write a steam review anymore. Yeah. Somebody shit in my pants. Somebody else
[3856.20s -> 3866.95s]  like, Hey, like shit in my pants. You want me to wear your pants and then shit in them? Yeah.
[3867.96s -> 3879.16s]  Okay. And let me get this straight. All this because you're upset at a video game. Is that
[3879.16s -> 3901.37s]  what I'm understanding here? Yes. Okay. Oh, just make sure I'm clear. Hey, what was chapter three?
[3918.50s -> 3933.27s]  Oh, shit. I have to beat it in arcade mode. Wait, what? Hold on. How was this any different than
[3933.27s -> 3947.58s]  what I was just doing? Wait a minute. What didn't? Am I, is this correct? Stage three waiting room.
[3947.58s -> 3956.31s]  All right. What happened? You can't unlock chapters in chapter select. Are you fucking kidding me?
[3967.48s -> 3981.11s]  So I have to go to, okay. So I have to do our arcade mode and I have to, oh man.
[3982.41s -> 3990.41s]  Um, so I'm just gonna give myself a hundred continues. Right. So I'm going to give myself
[3990.41s -> 3999.62s]  like five continues. I get a continue. Yeah. Um, I leveled up. I get another good. Yeah. Yeah.
[4000.42s -> 4008.58s]  Yes. Sir. Sir. Madam. I need to tell you. Yes. That's what's happening. What we're doing. Uh,
[4008.58s -> 4022.73s]  we're going to, we're going to, uh, settings game and I'm playing one can free play. I can just do
[4022.73s -> 4031.29s]  it in. I do not free play, right? That's, that's like, that's a joke. Um, five continues. Let's do
[4031.29s -> 4041.61s]  free play. Who cares? No, but then I can just do it forever. That's super cheating. All right. Five
[4041.61s -> 4049.14s]  lives. Three continues. That's normal. That's normal. That's normal. That's what I'm doing.
[4049.14s -> 4067.24s]  You need 25 lives to beat this. Just do infinite. We won't judge you. Yeah. Right. There's no way I
[4067.24s -> 4073.78s]  don't get judged. I've already been judged. I will see that one person is going to keep me up at
[4073.78s -> 4080.20s]  night. Uh, red lemonade, another five community subs from red lemonade. Thank you. Red lemonade
[4081.24s -> 4090.57s]  and a 5,000 bits. Hold on. 50 bucks from Goyky. Just gave 5,000 fucking bits right now.
[4090.57s -> 4094.81s]  Dude, I've had my quarter on the game for like an hour now. Are you done yet?
[4094.81s -> 4098.73s]  Can you just let me goddamn play? Also, please stop talking about people shitting in your mouth.
[4098.73s -> 4109.67s]  It's scary. I remember that you put a coin up on the cabinet and that meant that it's my turn next.
[4112.20s -> 4120.60s]  I do remember that. But what happens when the guy comes in with like $20 in tokens and fills the
[4120.60s -> 4132.31s]  whole thing up like I just did? You have one token on there. I've put in like 40 to stay here. It
[4132.31s -> 4135.75s]  should be a fucking walk in the park though. I mean, like, look, I know what I'm doing.
[4144.18s -> 4149.30s]  Remember when I first played this? Holy fuck. I just ate my words. Yeah, I'll get this shit.
[4150.34s -> 4169.13s]  Let's go. Look at that polarity shifting fucking expertise. Look at that fucking polarity shifting
[4169.13s -> 4189.45s]  expertise right there. All right, do this. Let's go. Bingo. One, two, three, go.
[4190.25s -> 4217.34s]  Fuck out of here. Come on. Got it. Nice. Cod Modern Warfare 3 waiting room.
[4219.32s -> 4224.70s]  Stop. All right. I got full. I didn't even lose one health. Let's keep it rolling.
[4224.70s -> 4264.04s]  Polarity shift. Inbound. Got one. This is it. Clean. Get rid of that shit. Clean. Very clean.
[4264.04s -> 4311.67s]  There it is. Here comes the tricky one. Eat them all. Eat them all. See what? That's what we call
[4311.67s -> 4324.46s]  fucking clean. On level two. Let's unlock chapter three. Boring visual. I want face cam. All right.
[4324.46s -> 4350.09s]  Fine. How does that see? I didn't get hit once. I'm getting tangled in my cord. I fucking stupid
[4350.09s -> 4368.62s]  ass fucking headphones are like strangling me. All right, let's go. Fill the right border with
[4368.62s -> 4379.26s]  your face. What an annoying request. You know what I mean? Not that what you said was annoying,
[4379.26s -> 4424.41s]  but that's going to annoy people. Fine. This is annoying. This is annoying. This is so annoying.
[4424.97s -> 4467.42s]  Okay, easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. All right, good. This is annoying. Okay, I switched. What's happening?
[4467.90s -> 4538.55s]  Okay, we're good. All right, same deal. Oh, stop calling me a nerd. I should be going switch,
[4538.55s -> 4542.79s]  switch, switch, switch, switch, switch, switch. I don't, but it's not. I know. I could be missing.
[4542.79s -> 4567.75s]  I'm missing out on points, but I want the HP. Take the whole eat it. Good. Okay. All right.
[4567.75s -> 4573.59s]  I'm ready to go on to chapter three. Mirror it. You need to see that info. All right. Stop.
[4573.59s -> 4651.83s]  I'm going to get hit by something if you don't stop it. No, you motherfucker. Fuck out of here.
[4651.83s -> 4656.07s]  I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. Stop.
[4656.07s -> 4678.31s]  This is annoying. This is annoying me. This is annoying me. Get rid of this. Get rid of the game.
[4682.97s -> 4690.39s]  Two big bits in a row. Jesus. Uh, phylactery liches gave a hundred dollars in bits. Chapter three.
[4690.39s -> 4699.45s]  Hold on. Hold on. Phylactery lich. Uh, 10,000 bits. It's, it's fucking phylactery. This is like
[4700.09s -> 4714.66s]  more. This is like $7,000 over the last like six months. Holy shit. Insanity. Anyways, they say,
[4714.66s -> 4718.90s]  it's not my birthday, but please mirror your face cam to the other side so that you stare at yourself
[4722.02s -> 4726.42s]  while you were gone. I got lonely. So I watched grill master X BBQ instead. He turned himself
[4726.42s -> 4731.06s]  into a pickle and it was the funniest shit I've ever seen. Almost split my zero calorie monster.
[4731.70s -> 4785.08s]  Fuck. Wait, it's not your birthday. This is so bad. I feel bad for people that want to fucking
[4785.08s -> 4795.14s]  enjoy a video game. I feel bad for some of you that like actually now, now a majority of the stream
[4795.70s -> 4802.04s]  is not Icaruga. You know that, right? A majority of the stream now is just look at the streamer's
[4802.04s -> 4824.47s]  fucking mirrored face. This is no longer an Icaruga stream. Oh shit. I can't kill it.
[4825.11s -> 4840.09s]  How do I get by that? Oh my fucking God. I'm losing it. How am I? How do I get by this? Oh shit.
[4840.73s -> 4885.46s]  We got to slow the fuck down. Just hug the corner here. Let's go boss. That was nuts. That was the
[4885.46s -> 4925.88s]  intro. That was the intro to chapter three. Super chain. That was totally fucking mother of what's
[4925.88s -> 5020.42s]  it doing? What the fuck? Holy shit. The thing I've got infinite continues. Um, what? Holy,
[5020.42s -> 5068.07s]  that's so ridiculous. That's insanity. Now with the Ferris wheel, welcome to bullet hell.
[5070.02s -> 5075.22s]  Let's go. Let's do it. Can I turn this off now? This is, have we irritated everybody enough?
[5075.22s -> 5083.06s]  You mutton chops are coming in. I just, I shaved. What do you mean no? Nobody wants to view this.
[5084.02s -> 5092.46s]  This is like a hurts people's eyes. Look at like, I can like come in on you. What do you
[5092.46s -> 5114.09s]  guys see that one? The viewers went up. I'm having it on for the next. This is it. Well,
[5114.09s -> 5140.76s]  I've already shipped. Well, I've already shipped inbound. Oh boy. Wonder how Jim is going to get
[5140.76s -> 5159.34s]  out of this one. I'm just the fucking weirdo that just is in the corner. I'm watching the show with
[5159.34s -> 5169.18s]  you. I don't know what to look at. That's what I'm fucking saying. I know I'm taking it off.
[5169.18s -> 5210.46s]  Imagine if you could switch polarity like crazy. Got it. Ban him. Keep it. It's fine. It's the theme
[5210.46s -> 5227.66s]  of the game. Keep it all. We riot. All right. I'm at fucking, I'm at the pursuer. How big is the
[5227.66s -> 5237.02s]  pixel? Anybody know how big the pixel is for this? Is it just one pixel? What should I be concerned
[5237.02s -> 5257.77s]  with? Fundamentals. Fundamentals only. Fundamentals only. Fundamentals only fundamentals. Take it all
[5257.77s -> 5299.29s]  in and absorb, absorb, absorb, absorb, absorb, absorb, absorb and fire and fire. Whoa, that was
[5299.29s -> 5321.64s]  intense. Oh, I can only turn one of them off. Kiss yourself. I, hold on. I can't, I, do you see what,
[5321.64s -> 5369.26s]  what, I, I can't get through this. You see the fucking wall, man. I can smell you making fun
[5369.26s -> 5390.98s]  of me. Stop or I'll cry. Stop or I'll cry. Stop or I'll cry. Stop or I'll cry. Am I dressed like
[5390.98s -> 5400.38s]  Shaggy? It's a green shirt. It's one of the primary colors. Red, green, blue, and the other ones.
[5429.22s -> 5434.15s]  I'm just testing you. I'm just like testing you to see if you can fucking make it go like I do.
[5434.79s -> 5453.43s]  All right. Open up. Open up now. Open up now. Open up now. Open up now. Sick. All right. We're
[5453.43s -> 5463.18s]  going to get to chapter three with all continues and all health bars. You know, this is the first
[5463.18s -> 5499.78s]  for me. I really thought that one was going to be the end of me. What am I? All right. What,
[5499.78s -> 5505.99s]  why am I doing like a fucking Malcolm in the middle? Why do I keep addressing the camera?
[5509.38s -> 5525.50s]  Why is this like my video diary right now? You're not the boss of me now. You're not
[5525.50s -> 5557.46s]  the boss of me now. And you're not so cool. Polarity shit. Polarity in my pants. What the
[5557.46s -> 5571.62s]  fuck are you saying? I mean, no. All right. Stop. We're just going for one side.
[5574.02s -> 5587.64s]  Worth it. Switch sides. Check it out. Boom. That's how you fucking get it done. Did you see,
[5587.64s -> 5640.86s]  did you see that shit? Fuck. Break it. Break it. Oh, my bad. I can't escape. I can't. That's my
[5640.86s -> 5661.85s]  escape shoot. It only does one. What's, you should play Lisa the Painful. Did anybody just say that
[5661.85s -> 5690.28s]  or am I making that up to be annoyed? Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. That's how you get it. Fucking.
[5693.08s -> 5727.45s]  I made it. Oh, no. Putties. Everybody got that? You don't even watch Power Rangers.
[5728.58s -> 5732.50s]  What are you? All right. I got, this is fucking me up.
[5732.50s -> 5758.92s]  No, here they come. Here they come to fire. All right. I got, I didn't do well on that one
[5758.92s -> 5774.84s]  last time. Polarity shift. Go back. Go back. Little, the little guy. All right. I got,
[5774.84s -> 5797.78s]  I got plenty of continues. I'm good. All right. Switch. Polarity. What the fuck? I hit the button
[5797.78s -> 5904.81s]  my fat ass finger. Yo. What? Easy. Easy there. Holy shit. That guy sucks. Oh, oh, it's, it's like
[5924.82s -> 5931.05s]  it moves fucking faster. Oh shit. It's going the other way.
[5942.82s -> 5958.06s]  Go this way instead. Oh, my God. I'm fucking running this shit. I don't know if it continues.
[5966.58s -> 5972.87s]  This is unfucking believable. This shit is like so fucking difficult. Like,
[5982.81s -> 6003.34s]  fuck. I had so many fucking, all right. That's it. Delay one side. I can't. I tried it before.
[6003.34s -> 6023.22s]  I need to get this off. This is like, I'm annoying you. I'm annoying me. Give me that chain. You're
[6023.22s -> 6031.75s]  making it better. Give us more. There's no more room to put more. What do you mean you want more?
[6046.22s -> 6069.45s]  I can't do more. Add a reverb. You just made me die. Why would I add a reverb? That's the, why would
[6069.45s -> 6081.56s]  you, why do you want that? You don't want this. Nobody here actually wants me to do this. Besides,
[6081.56s -> 6086.84s]  you, you're the only person in the room when I said, who wants a reverb? And that there's 10,000
[6086.84s -> 6091.08s]  fucking people in this audience. I see one hand and I go, that's all right. Let's get it on there.
[6094.46s -> 6104.94s]  Invert the colors. Make it for different polarities. I don't think I can do that.
[6106.33s -> 6112.79s]  One white and one black. I don't think I can do that. I can't do like a monochrome thing.
[6115.40s -> 6123.02s]  It's too, it won't work. Negative. That was, that's going to hurt your eyes.
[6130.28s -> 6192.20s]  I have to, I can't. All my webcams are packed. There. Now wait. Make one delayed. I can't unless
[6192.20s -> 6198.12s]  I have another webcam. I would, I seriously would love to do that. I really would, but I need a
[6198.12s -> 6208.22s]  second webcam because it takes the source. I can't do it. The reason why I could do that before is
[6208.22s -> 6217.75s]  because I had another cam. Turn one upside down. Get a set. I don't, it's, everything's packed. I
[6217.75s -> 6230.71s]  don't have anything. I wonder if I could fuck it. Can I split this? Let me see. No, I can't. It's
[6230.71s -> 6243.67s]  the same source. Add more. No, I can't do it. Add ambient audio effects. Oh fuck. I'm still on a
[6243.67s -> 6252.39s]  reverb. No, not four more. No, no, no, not four more. No, no. You're getting this for a little
[6252.39s -> 6285.66s]  while. No, not prototype mode. Backup. No, how do I get the fuck out of here? How do I, where's the,
[6285.66s -> 6314.17s]  the fuck is happening? Here we go. No, I don't want to see the fucking credits. All right,
[6314.17s -> 6322.02s]  here we go. Now I'm going to play. This hurts my head. I know. I blame the 15 people that said to
[6322.02s -> 6335.46s]  do this and I'm turning it off soon. All right, let's go. The one on the left is, just doesn't
[6335.46s -> 6345.83s]  make any sense. I changed where the thing is on the screen. I don't like that. Put it back. Where
[6345.83s -> 6365.51s]  was it? Put that back. Was it six? Right there. Keep it. All right, this is the one. I'm going to
[6365.51s -> 6370.98s]  get past chapter three. I really should play chapter three on its own and practice it.
[6371.70s -> 6387.08s]  That's the correct thing to do. Yes. If I get past chapter three, then I'm going to pick chapter
[6387.08s -> 6413.00s]  four and I'm going to practice chapter four. Choose your fighter. Select your character.
[6414.34s -> 6419.78s]  Let me take you for a ride. I want to take you for a ride.
[6424.92s -> 6429.64s]  Now let me take you for a ride. You know, when I was younger, I, you know what I thought that they
[6429.64s -> 6435.61s]  were saying? I thought that instead of take you for a ride, I thought they were saying,
[6435.61s -> 6445.37s]  I want to shake you boom boom ba. I want to shake you boom boom ba. I was like fucking 13. I don't
[6445.37s -> 6459.48s]  know. I want to shake you boom boom ba. I want to shake boom boom ba. He's literally deaf.
[6459.88s -> 6484.57s]  You made me die. All right, just play. Molly, I want to go home. What the fuck. Polarity shift
[6484.57s -> 6514.90s]  incoming in three, two. Activate polarity switch. Fill it up, fill it up, fill it up, fill it up,
[6514.90s -> 6539.22s]  fill it up, fill it up. New viewer here. Does this guy always do stuff like this? Well,
[6539.22s -> 6545.80s]  I'm one of those gamers that plays kind of whatever he feels like. I'll be live three,
[6545.80s -> 6584.92s]  four days a week. Left forever. Make two more. What do you want me to have them just all fucking
[6584.92s -> 6590.92s]  on the side like a shitty wallpaper? You're going to crash my computer. You're going to crash. My
[6590.92s -> 6597.86s]  computer is going to crash if I do that. You don't want that. Oh my God, you do. You guys have lost
[6597.86s -> 6613.85s]  your fucking minds. This is going to look like shit. Keep this one. I'll put them on the squares.
[6614.81s -> 6623.30s]  God, I wish I had fucking access to like five or 10 cameras. Hold on to this because I'm going to
[6623.30s -> 6631.86s]  get like 15 webcams and set them all up and just fucking have a brawl in my living room. I'm going
[6631.86s -> 6638.26s]  to beat the shit out of myself with like 30 different webcams. It's going to be fucking crazy.
[6638.26s -> 6644.30s]  They're all going to be in like random. I'm going to lose track of everything. I should,
[6644.30s -> 6648.38s]  I should like delay some of them by like four minutes and get in like costumes and come in
[6648.38s -> 6653.10s]  and be like, it's me, Superman. And then fucking just start, just walk off set.
[6653.90s -> 6667.54s]  This is going to be nuts. I'm going to buy like 30 webcams. Ah, this is,
[6669.14s -> 6672.82s]  no thanks. This is going to take like, this is going to take like 30 minutes to do this. Just this
[6674.82s -> 6678.74s]  one man. I got it. That's, that's, I got to do that. I can't even fucking see, man.
[6679.30s -> 6750.76s]  Is that in there? I'm going to crash OBS. Turn the brightness up. I will. It's Andy Warhol.
[6751.40s -> 6755.00s]  This is going to be such a pain in the ass to delete every single fucking one of these
[6755.00s -> 6763.64s]  in a little bit. We're going to have so much fun with the 30 webcams stream.
[6764.76s -> 6768.87s]  I'm going to do that sooner than you think. In fact, I'm just going to fucking order them like
[6768.87s -> 6778.36s]  today. We're going to have like a bunch of different scenarios that I was going to play out.
[6779.40s -> 6785.45s]  It'll be a lot of fun. That, how much, okay, hold on a minute. How much is a webcam?
[6786.41s -> 6792.74s]  All right. This is, you're talking, this is a real investment. A decent webcam is like 60 or 70 bucks.
[6794.02s -> 6802.38s]  I can do like full HD 60 FPS. It's like $60. So this is going to be thousands of dollars.
[6802.94s -> 6809.29s]  Just get really garbage ones. Yep. They won't, they might not be able to even get pulled through.
[6810.65s -> 6814.81s]  What? Okay. I get, do you want me to get a bunch of $30 webcams? What am I going to do with these
[6814.81s -> 6824.90s]  when I'm done? What am I going to do with them? Just get wicked shitty ones. Give them away.
[6825.46s -> 6847.50s]  I'm not going to give away 30 webcams. All right. That's good. Oh, whoa. They're all swimming
[6847.50s -> 6890.78s]  together. Okay. Let's change this. What's going on? Why is it doing this? This thing is broken.
[6890.78s -> 6923.14s]  There we go. Wow. Hey, chat. How many fingers am I holding up? That's fucking terrifying. All right.
[6923.14s -> 6950.10s]  Let's go. Icaruga. Some said it's one of the hardest games ever made. Some say Icaruga.
[6950.98s -> 6962.90s]  Some say it's one of the hardest games ever. 12 more in the little slots in the bottom left.
[6962.90s -> 6968.95s]  No, you guys need to be able to see when I have power. I just invited my friend to this stream.
[6968.95s -> 6988.55s]  He left. Oh, his loss. Hey, let me guess. Uh, when he left and he was like, fuck that stream,
[6988.55s -> 6997.37s]  you were like, yeah, man, down the Twitch rabbit hole. You find all kinds of fucking characters
[6997.37s -> 7016.82s]  on a down Twitch rabbit hole. I'm leaving. Stay. Why? What would you leave for? I'm playing
[7016.82s -> 7032.81s]  Icaruga. Some say hardest fucking game ever. This is my first stream. What's up, dude? Welcome to the...
[7034.25s -> 7042.52s]  What are we calling ourselves now? What are we calling ourselves now? The... I don't know.
[7042.52s -> 7050.90s]  There's too many groups. There's like the Moo crew, the Drew crew. What's the Jerma crew?
[7051.46s -> 7082.55s]  Do I have one? I don't think I even have one. Do I? Is anybody listening to me? The Jerms. No,
[7082.55s -> 7106.47s]  that's like 2012. How about the wicked sloppy eaters? That kind of rolls off the tongue. Kind
[7106.47s -> 7128.28s]  of cool. Bingo. Bingo. Oh, yeah. Welcome to the stream, guys. Hey, it's us. You know that this
[7128.28s -> 7134.36s]  group. Hey, you just you just followed for the first time. Welcome to the We Put Too Much
[7134.36s -> 7167.16s]  Fucking Ketchup on All of Our Food crew. We love that shit here. Oh, you fucking idiot.
[7171.88s -> 7180.41s]  You just bumped me. No, you bumped me. I was coming out of the fucking spot and you didn't stop for me.
[7180.41s -> 7188.07s]  You can slow down. What's your fucking insurance? Unbelievable. Pay fucking attention.
[7189.69s -> 7218.84s]  And notice you didn't put your cart back either. Dick. I can't. Oh, I can't wait to like chug a water.
[7219.40s -> 7222.92s]  I'm going to drink like I'm going to. OK, I'm going to like chug a water at some point during
[7222.92s -> 7227.40s]  the 30 webcam stream. And at some point, like 10 minutes after I start streaming, one of them is
[7227.40s -> 7251.82s]  going to slam the water. One of them. Multiply my mic channel. No, we'll save it. What are you
[7251.82s -> 7261.40s]  doing? Don't switch. What are you doing? All right. Itchy face. Medicine, Max. Max about medicine.
[7262.12s -> 7304.15s]  Skip everything quick. What the fuck are you doing? I'm fucking crazy, I think.
[7305.11s -> 7320.94s]  What happened to you in the last few days? Well, I'm packing boxes and moving and it's making me
[7320.94s -> 7328.42s]  crazy. No, I've been actually been I've been OK. It's been fun. I've had a good time on these
[7328.42s -> 7346.74s]  streams. That's what I love. I love. Great. All right, let's get this done. I got three.
[7355.90s -> 7358.86s]  What the fuck even hit me? Game is not even programmed correctly.
[7378.14s -> 7391.77s]  I do sound like a fucking psycho, huh? I'm just having fun, man. Oh, my. All right. He comes.
[7391.77s -> 7399.00s]  Watch out. I thought he went through. God damn it. When does he blast through? Right now, right?
[7400.31s -> 7431.67s]  Jesus. He's shitting me. Dude, fuck this guy. Dude, this guy's a fucking pain in the ass.
[7432.23s -> 7549.30s]  All right. How many continues do I have? Two. All right. Let's try to not fuck this up. One. What
[7549.30s -> 7568.70s]  the fuck? Where's the last one? Where's the last one? Where's the last one? Oh, up in smoke.
[7569.26s -> 7581.80s]  Clap. It only took cheating. This is level four. Time to turn up the difficulty.
[7585.62s -> 7602.34s]  Mm hmm. Can I absorb those? I guess. All right. That's what it's about. Reality is unveiled.
[7602.34s -> 7610.18s]  And what did it want? You have noisy eyelashes. You know, I actually can hear my eyelashes when
[7610.18s -> 7624.06s]  I sleep. It's like, I mean, that that person's that person's a sicko, but you know, whatever.
[7640.30s -> 7655.74s]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is insanity. What happened to one of the Germans? I'm I want to practice
[7655.74s -> 7672.20s]  chapter four. I got an achievement. One of them has to go. Oh, right. OK. See you later, dude.
[7672.20s -> 7681.10s]  No, no, no. Wait, wait. I have to confirm. Everybody fucking everybody point and laugh at
[7681.10s -> 7699.70s]  this guy. See you. You're leaving. Ha ha ha ha. I'm not going to multiply the mics. All right.
[7699.70s -> 7713.24s]  Let's I want to get I got to get a good feel for it after four takes practice. Practice makes
[7713.24s -> 7722.82s]  perfect. You know, I'm just going to feel for it. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now,
[7722.82s -> 7742.70s]  but it's not a good. It's not working. One to two left. Bilateral religion of the five hundred
[7742.70s -> 7751.06s]  fucking fifty. Whatever it is, it's fifty dollars. Five thousand bits from phylactery phylactery
[7751.06s -> 7757.08s]  says by the webcam slave. This is pleasing to chat. I'm going to get them. Well, I'm going to
[7757.08s -> 7767.77s]  do that as soon as I can. This is this is absurd. I have to stay on one polarity. I can't change.
[7772.98s -> 7791.46s]  And then they start coming in. Holy fuck. Lord, use the shields to your advantage.
[7791.46s -> 7808.18s]  Well, I I'm kind of itchy head right now. Hold on. This game was designed to take
[7808.18s -> 7836.95s]  fifty dollars from each person that wanted to try to play. Where's the safe place to stand here?
[7852.14s -> 7906.94s]  Hope I get back here with ten fucking continues. That is of course not. Holy shit.
[7907.18s -> 7922.26s]  Come on, stinky. This is a baby game. Multiply mics. I can't do that. Oh, my God. You're killing me.
[7922.74s -> 7956.30s]  How many are there? What is that? What was that? What was that? I don't even know what it was.
[7956.86s -> 7966.82s]  What happened? What was that? Was the game audio? Why is the game audio coming through?
[7967.86s -> 7996.71s]  This is all fucked up because of because of the mixer. How about this? That change anything? No,
[7996.71s -> 8010.20s]  that change anything? No, that's fucked up. I can't do it. Just add a chorus.
[8011.00s -> 8017.54s]  Might as well just do this. This is potential best joke in 2020. I would hold on to that
[8017.54s -> 8024.82s]  because it's going to be thirty fucking webcams attached here. We this this joke is going to be
[8024.82s -> 8034.76s]  is going to absolutely run its entire course. I can't do it. It won't work. I got this fucking
[8034.76s -> 8040.81s]  mixer. It's all screwed up. Twenty nine and I'll be furious. All right, let me try to figure out
[8040.81s -> 8046.47s]  this fucking chapter four. We have thirty USB ports. I'll just get a I'll get a extension.
[8048.04s -> 8056.09s]  Hopefully, I have to be careful because if I have a USB extender with like an extra ten,
[8060.34s -> 8066.86s]  right, you know what I'm saying? Like, would that work? I need enough like bus spots, right?
[8066.86s -> 8138.58s]  Whatever they're called needs to be an active extension. Oh, man. Try just not fire at all.
[8138.98s -> 8143.30s]  The wall. Yeah, but they come down this wall. They they behind the wall. They still fly in.
[8144.10s -> 8170.46s]  I was doing a thousand continues. I don't care. I'm literally going to put on 99 continues.
[8170.46s -> 8178.10s]  You call me a cheater if you want to. This is fucking crazy. They've already taken like
[8178.10s -> 8183.75s]  thirty dollars of my tokens at this point. Can I sit back here? What if I just hold on? What if
[8183.75s -> 8192.41s]  I just sit back here? Wait, hold on. I probably should only go. I'm going to only shoot for the.
[8193.59s -> 8199.27s]  I don't know. This is fucking outrageous. Left. Jeremiah could have done this.
[8201.05s -> 8208.04s]  Fuck, man. This is so fucking crazy. Left, right, left, right, left, right while switching polarity
[8208.76s -> 8216.28s]  like right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left, right,
[8216.28s -> 8235.22s]  right, left, left, right, right, left, fuck, right, left. This is a five hundred dollar game.
[8235.94s -> 8238.42s]  Like you've got to spend you've got to spend five hundred dollars to beat this.
[8251.78s -> 8255.30s]  This is one of those scenarios where the guy you know when you went to the arcade and you would get
[8255.94s -> 8260.06s]  the cup because it didn't fit in your pocket. How many tokens you got?
[8260.78s -> 8266.90s]  There's somebody with a big fucking big gulp cup sitting on top of this desk onto on the cabinet.
[8267.86s -> 8277.06s]  And they're just like if the thing weighs like fucking three and a half pounds like that,
[8278.02s -> 8281.78s]  it's a big unit and it's probably has like two or three hundred tokens in it.
[8285.93s -> 8289.61s]  Call me cheater if you want. I just want to see the I want to see the boss. Call me cheater. I don't care.
[8289.61s -> 8323.99s]  Remember there's a line of people behind you and they're all small but look at them.
[8326.39s -> 8343.35s]  Let's exit the game. What just happened? All right, let's go. It's time. Chapter four. Chapter select.
[8343.35s -> 8351.99s]  I'm beating this shit even if I have to fucking use powers. Wait, I should do arcade mode then,
[8351.99s -> 8365.21s]  right? Somebody said your five eight lol. Yeah and somewhere like fucking 700 million people on the
[8365.21s -> 8376.57s]  planet. Oh wow. Oh I can't believe he's five eight. That's like the same size of like a billion people.
[8377.53s -> 8394.79s]  Why does he so sound so what? Tom Cruise is fucking five seven.
[8395.35s -> 8413.40s]  All in him and that motherfucker like saves the world. But what I'm talking about in his movies.
[8413.40s -> 8432.28s]  What? I can't. They make him stand on boxes. Energy Max. This is pretty good. This is pretty
[8432.28s -> 8436.76s]  significant play in this game. Doesn't matter. I have infinite lives. We're just going to beat
[8436.76s -> 8457.93s]  the fucking game right now. Doesn't count. That's okay. Whatever. Whatever. This game is pretty cool
[8457.93s -> 8489.06s]  though. This game is really good. How is it not dead? Play with 99 lives instead of infinite
[8489.06s -> 8494.68s]  continues. I think I went right past that boat. I just I want to see the bosses and stuff. Look,
[8494.68s -> 8509.03s]  I'm playing on like story mode. Play Mario Paint. Is that game good? Is that like the Looney Tunes
[8509.03s -> 8542.33s]  one for Super Nintendo? Come on. Come on. Kick up Luka. Energy Max. Energy Max. Energy Max.
[8544.76s -> 8570.23s]  My grandma can play this game better than you. Oh yeah? Challenging. Rewarding.
[8578.71s -> 8591.16s]  Why is this stream under puzzle category? What? What? This is under. Why is it under puzzle?
[8595.18s -> 8603.45s]  English puzzle shoot them up. I didn't do that. Oh that's another thing we can do.
[8604.01s -> 8608.65s]  Okay so I'm gonna write this down. On the 30 webcam stream we're gonna do a
[8608.65s -> 8614.79s]  German jigsaw puzzle with my whole body. I'm gonna like just stand and we're gonna try to
[8614.79s -> 8620.36s]  put me together. Sounds fun. All right well by the way we're doing this in like we're doing this in
[8620.36s -> 8625.82s]  like less than five days. You understand? This is happening like within the next week. I fucking
[8625.82s -> 8631.02s]  promise. We're doing this like this like probably next weekend. I swear to god this is too interesting
[8631.02s -> 8644.54s]  for me. Don't give me hope. No there's no way that doesn't happen. If I can connect I might need
[8644.54s -> 8651.74s]  another computer right? I might need to get another computer like a laptop which also has like seven
[8651.74s -> 8659.66s]  or eight USB buses. Feed that video through and control them. Like I'm gonna need like probably
[8659.66s -> 8671.82s]  three computers right? Laptop with eight. What happened? Why did I leave the game for?
[8672.46s -> 8687.86s]  What just happened? What just happened? Why did that just kick me out?
[8690.68s -> 8706.52s]  I lost? Like no I didn't. It was on chapter select? No it was not. Is it goes on free play?
[8707.80s -> 8719.35s]  It was? No well fuck I can't believe it. No it wasn't. You sure it was? Fuck. One player game arcade.
[8723.42s -> 8737.35s]  Arcade. It was on it. Arcade normal. German forgot his homework. He didn't tell us why he never was
[8737.35s -> 8740.95s]  gonna play Lisa. I just well I told you yesterday because I don't want to.
[8741.91s -> 8754.38s]  What? Didn't I say I don't want to play? I'm not playing Odama right now. I gotta figure out how
[8754.38s -> 8761.62s]  I'm gonna do this webcam thing. Does anybody know realistically how many actual video devices you
[8761.62s -> 8767.45s]  can pull through something like OBS without having a separate computer? Hold that like that speed.
[8768.41s -> 8773.10s]  What is it like four or five? At least and it's at least two. It's probably it's probably like five
[8773.10s -> 8801.99s]  or six. 12? OBS allows at least Odama. Fucking god. Kill the big one on the left and then the big
[8801.99s -> 8806.23s]  one on the right. Did you check the toilets on the left? Did you check the toilets on the right? Did
[8806.23s -> 8808.71s]  you check toilets on the left? Did you check toilets on the right? Did you check toilets on the left?
[8808.71s -> 8811.11s]  Did you check toilets on the right? Did you check toilets on the left? Did you check the toilets on
[8811.11s -> 8831.24s]  the right? He's on crack. He's on crack. He's on crack. He's on crack. He's on crack. No he's not.
[8831.64s -> 8856.10s]  He's on crack. He's on crack. He's on crack. Okay stop.
[8860.70s -> 8891.11s]  Boring. Boring. Boring. Hair flip. Boring. Boring. Boring. Shut up. All right shut up. Kill
[8891.11s -> 8904.98s]  that one. What do you think I'm doing? I'm killing. We want blood. We want explosives. We want blood.
[8904.98s -> 8936.64s]  This is why the webcams never on you guys understand you get it now you actually get it
[8937.18s -> 8948.32s]  All right. So why am I not going to chapter two?
[8949.08s -> 8956.86s]  This is fucking me up. I thought it's because of nudity. Well, it's both. It's because of both
[8957.46s -> 8962.47s]  Okay, boss battle bonus. I did it score axe chain grade C
[8963.35s -> 8969.90s]  Moving on to chapter two. I don't what the fuck was that? That was weird. All right, let's do let's beat this whole damn game
[8970.62s -> 9004.23s]  Okay double, please. Stop swearing. Please stop. All right, I won't
[9004.83s -> 9009.67s]  You hear me swear one more time. I will give one community sub before every
[9010.83s -> 9012.83s]  FUCK you hear okay
[9016.38s -> 9017.86s]  only that one
[9017.86s -> 9027.14s]  Only for today by the way. Oh
[9027.46s -> 9035.82s]  Only today only today today only for the next five straight minutes
[9036.86s -> 9057.62s]  Come on say it fun. I am having fun
[9070.65s -> 9079.22s]  And now he's having fun. I heard a I heard is I heard of rumor over there and typically I would say the upward
[9079.82s -> 9096.41s]  Not today though
[9096.41s -> 9097.53s]  stupid
[9097.53s -> 9125.35s]  Whoops, got it. Got it. Eat them all eat them all eat them all eat them all eat them all
[9131.80s -> 9148.94s]  When is he eating the shoe I'm not eating the shoe. All right, I'm not eating the shoe
[9154.23s -> 9164.54s]  Pardon to the mic
[9167.96s -> 9175.51s]  No, all right. Let's do this one
[9178.06s -> 9181.10s]  Why did I read that? I don't know. It's chats going real fast. I'm reading random shit
[9206.26s -> 9231.42s]  What the fuck man?
[9231.50s -> 9244.60s]  Whoa, I got the whole thing. Oh, whoops. That's a sub. That's one I
[9245.40s -> 9246.68s]  I
[9246.68s -> 9256.81s]  Completely forgot we were doing that. I don't I completely forgot. That's one. All right, you get one
[9258.09s -> 9260.41s]  I'll I'll I'll pay up at the end of the screen
[9260.81s -> 9265.54s]  Just give me to the end of the screen. Just give me to the end of the screen and i'll get you
[9280.95s -> 9282.95s]  I already have a sub. I want another one
[9283.96s -> 9285.56s]  greedy
[9285.56s -> 9292.74s]  Greedy
[9292.74s -> 9295.82s]  Give me another one. I greedy
[9295.82s -> 9297.82s]  All right. I'm just like fucking
[9297.98s -> 9322.57s]  That's two
[9322.57s -> 9326.28s]  Is there speed runs of this game? Do they run this that stuff like um
[9327.22s -> 9331.08s]  HDq or anything? I feel like this would be crazy to watch somebody do this and not get hit
[9331.80s -> 9342.41s]  The speed runs for every game
[9342.41s -> 9344.41s]  It might be inaccurate that might not be accurate
[9350.34s -> 9352.20s]  I'm, not sure that's accurate
[9352.20s -> 9354.20s]  It's something that nobody's speed run before
[9355.37s -> 9356.33s]  Right
[9356.33s -> 9388.44s]  All right. Let's go
[9388.44s -> 9390.44s]  I got funky
[9391.35s -> 9405.05s]  Oh, I didn't say I said funky
[9405.05s -> 9407.21s]  So I ran out of quarters and what I ended up doing
[9407.93s -> 9413.51s]  Is I um, I opened up the machine the front of the machine where the coins go
[9414.54s -> 9419.83s]  And there's that little tab that registers the coins and I got in there and went
[9421.35s -> 9429.16s]  And then I closed it up
[9429.24s -> 9437.78s]  That's illegal. Not if you own the arcade. It's not
[9439.14s -> 9441.14s]  Not if it's my place
[9442.17s -> 9445.53s]  After hours the business is closed. I want to play Icaruga until I win
[9449.94s -> 9454.71s]  I mean illegal
[9454.71s -> 9458.55s]  Hold on. It's illegal for me to open up an arcade cabinet that I own
[9459.19s -> 9461.19s]  after hours and
[9461.19s -> 9463.51s]  Jiggle the coin thing to get a hundred lives
[9465.62s -> 9467.22s]  No, it's not
[9467.22s -> 9469.22s]  I own the machine
[9477.05s -> 9484.28s]  I own the machine
[9484.28s -> 9486.28s]  Machine owns you what?
[9497.70s -> 9499.38s]  Now that okay
[9499.38s -> 9503.22s]  Doesn't matter
[9503.22s -> 9507.38s]  Okay, i'm just playing so sloppy now because when you know that you believe there's nothing to fear
[9507.70s -> 9512.18s]  I just like i'm like whatever I can just die a bunch of times. I own the fucking arcade
[9513.53s -> 9515.53s]  This game is kind of hard
[9519.69s -> 9531.85s]  All right play for real. Let's go
[9531.85s -> 9533.85s]  I mean, this is fucking hard as shit. It is
[9542.04s -> 9543.26s]  jeez
[9543.26s -> 9545.26s]  Give it up for four
[9547.27s -> 9548.55s]  For what?
[9548.55s -> 9550.39s]  Oh four subs
[9550.39s -> 9564.79s]  I mean, that's the technique
[9564.79s -> 9574.14s]  Got it. Where's the blood? This game sucks
[9585.02s -> 9608.34s]  Look at me times 20 shit shit these schmups. I swear these schmups are so difficult
[9612.34s -> 9614.34s]  Replay by the way omega low
[9615.18s -> 9616.22s]  Oh
[9616.22s -> 9641.02s]  Schmup. Hey you shut the schmup up. He's learning. He's learning
[9641.74s -> 9643.74s]  God, finally, he's learning
[9644.38s -> 9648.10s]  All right. I gotta slow down. I'm freaking some of you out right now
[9660.94s -> 9670.34s]  God my doesn't want to go. It's just coin. It's just coin stealing
[9671.30s -> 9678.09s]  This is stealing coins at this point
[9695.11s -> 9697.11s]  What even fucking hit me five
[9707.75s -> 9710.31s]  Oh my god, this is this is crazy
[9711.11s -> 9715.03s]  I feel like this is the part of the game where like if you speed run the game and you get hit once it's over
[9715.51s -> 9717.51s]  You hate this part
[9717.83s -> 9722.07s]  You probably you probably sit there and go this is the worst thing. I just gotta make sure I don't get hit
[9722.15s -> 9724.15s]  I gotta be careful. This is the worst one
[9725.11s -> 9736.33s]  This is easy when you know, yeah, I guess when you know, you just know right
[9737.37s -> 9740.65s]  But this part in particular is freaking me out. Should I follow the beams?
[9741.61s -> 9746.31s]  I mean, I guess this is kind of sort of
[9747.51s -> 9754.18s]  It's just too many colors on the screen. My brain can't look at it
[9760.92s -> 9762.92s]  It's it's too many colors
[9763.94s -> 9770.97s]  They're just fool. It's I feel like i'm playing like guitar hero 12 times in a row like on five different screens
[9772.30s -> 9773.34s]  and
[9773.34s -> 9790.23s]  Five different songs
[9790.23s -> 9792.55s]  Give us a good reason why you don't want to play lisa
[9796.57s -> 9817.75s]  Because I said so okay mom
[9818.55s -> 9829.86s]  This is it. This is what we separate the gamers from the
[9831.37s -> 9838.73s]  Whatever. I don't know
[9839.61s -> 9844.76s]  Hard game
[9844.76s -> 9849.16s]  I feel bad for that guy that wrote that steam review that doesn't realize you can put it on free play mode
[9849.48s -> 9852.36s]  I feel you man. You and I are you and I are in this together
[9858.98s -> 9868.26s]  What geez?
[9868.26s -> 9871.38s]  Okay, it's just don't move but it's you have to
[9876.09s -> 9878.09s]  I only have 13 seconds left
[9880.44s -> 9900.90s]  I'm gonna die from time
[9900.90s -> 9903.30s]  Uh, did that come back? Is that do I get more time?
[9904.10s -> 9909.21s]  Or what what happens here? Is that gonna start the countdown at three seconds right now?
[9910.01s -> 9917.78s]  No, it's not right. It's like a timed mission
[9918.42s -> 9920.44s]  All right. Here we go
[9920.44s -> 9935.59s]  Okay. Oh man
[9939.26s -> 9940.86s]  This is fucking
[9940.86s -> 9942.86s]  This is ridiculous
[9949.18s -> 9952.62s]  You have to you have to move you have to move
[9965.70s -> 9984.02s]  Dude, I can't even switch polarities in time. I'm gonna run out of time
[10011.99s -> 10013.99s]  Yo, kill him kill him. I have 10 seconds
[10032.47s -> 10048.07s]  Lame what do you mean lame? That was pog. Didn't I say I was gonna go pee like two hours ago? I did right?
[10052.62s -> 10055.88s]  You're a cheater
[10055.88s -> 10058.68s]  Call me whatever you want. I'm a winner in my book
[10064.36s -> 10066.36s]  That's a big chain 20 chain
[10071.02s -> 10099.08s]  Oh
[10099.08s -> 10101.08s]  Oh big boy
[10117.03s -> 10119.19s]  Would you play dark souls 3 with infinite health?
[10120.74s -> 10122.74s]  Not even a fair comparison
[10126.04s -> 10130.76s]  I make you alive so that you can walk along the right way, but you can't understand it. What is this the brain?
[10131.32s -> 10146.87s]  Right in the middle if you play dark souls with infinite health
[10148.17s -> 10150.71s]  No, I wouldn't but that that that that's
[10152.31s -> 10174.98s]  You're wrong. Damn. Okay. I guess i'm wrong then
[10178.55s -> 10181.35s]  You can't feel the visible things. How can you feel the invisible things?
[10181.83s -> 10197.72s]  This is pretty sick. Wait, let him grab me. Oh, no, this shit is fucking wacky
[10198.98s -> 10206.76s]  That's wacky
[10206.76s -> 10211.30s]  You gotta that's
[10211.38s -> 10216.50s]  Wacky, man. Oh, there's no way you beat this normally unless you put in 500 bucks
[10216.90s -> 10220.66s]  There's no way you do this normally without five hundred dollars
[10250.20s -> 10253.19s]  Don't cap that
[10253.19s -> 10256.39s]  It's impossible to cut off this metamorphosis forever. Can you see can't you?
[10257.11s -> 10292.15s]  Do I have to destroy something?
[10292.15s -> 10298.50s]  Holy shit absorb absorb fire
[10299.43s -> 10307.43s]  Absorb fire. I
[10339.70s -> 10355.99s]  That sure was a tricky one. Let's see how germ affairs are the next game. That was a disgusting empty win
[10359.05s -> 10363.45s]  Oh, that's not it. That's not it match. Um, can you imagine if I had gotten here and beat wow good thing
[10363.45s -> 10364.73s]  We didn't do that
[10364.73s -> 10367.29s]  Can you imagine if I had gotten here and just didn't do this?
[10373.83s -> 10381.62s]  Uh, what am I supposed to do?
[10391.83s -> 10393.83s]  You want to absorb for points
[10400.95s -> 10421.78s]  I gotta get at least four million zero
[10422.58s -> 10425.45s]  remain bonus plus five hundred thousand
[10426.85s -> 10429.51s]  four point seven eight five million points

[10436.22s -> 10438.22s]  Lights are filling every inch of the screen
[10438.94s -> 10449.13s]  This is a hollow victory
[10449.13s -> 10450.57s]  Maybe for you
[10450.57s -> 10452.74s]  Not for me
[10452.74s -> 10454.74s]  Is this what we wished for?
[10457.18s -> 10462.78s]  Don't worry, we will understand each other someday and the life is succeeded into a distant future. What the fuck is happening
[10464.12s -> 10466.12s]  There was like some kind of story here
[10471.83s -> 10473.34s]  Ikaruga
[10473.34s -> 10475.32s]  That was fucking fun
[10475.32s -> 10477.56s]  Hey, I beat the first three levels without cheating
[10478.12s -> 10481.64s]  That's a
[10481.64s -> 10485.48s]  Hey, if i'm allowed to if I take up 66 percent of the screen
[10486.73s -> 10489.29s]  I'm allowed to cheat for 66 percent of the game
[10490.71s -> 10493.27s]  Because the 66 percent of the game of the stream has been me
[10493.99s -> 10497.91s]  I'll be right back. I gotta pee
[10660.66s -> 10664.62s]  Okay, so i'm gonna make you all real sad right now
[10667.45s -> 10670.41s]  Well, hi, i'm gonna make you all real sad
[10673.08s -> 10673.88s]  I've

[10682.38s -> 10683.66s]  But they have to be
[10683.66s -> 10685.32s]  i'm sorry
[10685.32s -> 10691.54s]  That's the way it is. But I will tell you i'm going to work on something very very important
[10692.47s -> 10694.33s]  When I get back
[10694.33s -> 10696.97s]  Now I know you're not gonna want to hear this either and I don't want to say this either
[10696.97s -> 10699.53s]  But like I have to there's so many things I have to do and i'm sorry
[10701.13s -> 10708.57s]  I have to you have i'm gonna have to do another small leave of absence here another couple of days
[10708.89s -> 10711.69s]  Another two or three days and then we'll hopefully be back to normal
[10712.25s -> 10716.65s]  I'm sorry. I know i'm sorry. I know I know I know I know I know I was just gone for like five days
[10717.05s -> 10724.02s]  And this we just did three here and they're shorter. I know I trust me. I know I want to stay but
[10725.78s -> 10728.74s]  I forgot i'm like over here. I'm like leaning it but
[10732.09s -> 10736.50s]  Wink to make up for it
[10736.50s -> 10738.04s]  I
[10738.04s -> 10740.38s]  Here's what you can look forward to
[10740.38s -> 10745.58s]  The next stream was a calendar when I come back
[10746.22s -> 10750.02s]  You ready for this?

[10791.42s -> 10794.28s]  So like not only am I going to go do a bunch of other shit
[10794.68s -> 10800.36s]  But i'm going to do a ton of research into how I can get like at least 10 to 15 webcams pointed at me and captured
[10801.00s -> 10806.78s]  But with that I am you're going to see here we go. We're going to disappear here
[10807.58s -> 10808.94s]  Who's going to be left?
[10808.94s -> 10810.54s]  All right, place your bets
[10810.54s -> 10816.63s]  Place your bets, which one's going to be the last one remaining. I'm just going down to listening deleting them. Who's going to remain?
[10818.25s -> 10832.94s]  Who's lights going to turn off last top right? That's cheating though. It wasn't even top right. It was this guy

[10855.35s -> 10857.35s]  Nine, are you adding numbers on?
[10857.75s -> 10860.57s]  Why do I look so weird? Oh, it's because i'm flipped
[10861.37s -> 10863.37s]  It was nine. Was it nine?

[11089.75s -> 11093.35s]  But get a bootleg wild ranger instead and proceed to cry
[11094.33s -> 11096.76s]  It's great fun though

[11645.74s -> 11647.74s]  I thought somebody had the same name as me
[11647.82s -> 11651.18s]  I was about to thank german 985 for 10 subs and I was like, wait a minute. That's me
[11651.90s -> 11653.34s]  I just did that
[11653.34s -> 11658.82s]  Right. Hey, sergel, but thanks to 250. I've been absent from streams recently
[11659.46s -> 11661.86s]  preparing financially for the great depression 2
[11662.34s -> 11666.02s]  Depressed harder makes me concerned for how you've been dealing with this
[11666.58s -> 11668.90s]  You don't want to get too personal. Just give me a kiss instead
[11669.86s -> 11672.98s]  How is that? No, that's like five times more. What are you what?
[11674.47s -> 11680.15s]  um
[11680.15s -> 11686.07s]  You got I was gonna like start saying like oh here and then you threw that in there and now i'm all you fucked me all up
[11686.87s -> 11693.26s]  um
[11693.26s -> 11695.62s]  Okay
[11695.62s -> 11700.12s]  Well, I hope we don't get there. I really hope that that doesn't happen
[11701.08s -> 11706.52s]  Hope that over the next few months we can really just try to get back to normal. Hopefully there's a
[11707.56s -> 11709.56s]  Vaccine comes out sooner than
[11709.56s -> 11714.52s]  Later, I know people are thinking it's maybe the end of the year or early next year. Hopefully we make it to there
[11716.34s -> 11719.70s]  Slowly we get rid of this shit. That's what I hope that's what I really want
[11720.18s -> 11724.38s]  Right. Everybody wants that
[11724.38s -> 11727.50s]  We've been told like 12 to 18 months for a vaccine
[11729.72s -> 11731.40s]  and now hopefully
[11731.40s -> 11734.22s]  over the next few months
[11734.22s -> 11737.58s]  We start to cases start to slow down. That's the number one thing
[11739.02s -> 11740.94s]  Once you're in a pandemic
[11740.94s -> 11744.22s]  It's people are going to get it. It's going to spread. That's what a virus does, right?
[11744.38s -> 11750.62s]  But to try to make it so it doesn't spread everywhere to everyone is what we're trying to do
[11756.89s -> 11758.17s]  Be careful
[11758.17s -> 11761.29s]  especially if you are in direct contact with people that
[11761.93s -> 11768.09s]  Are susceptible to the illness right leg if you have older people people with underlying conditions, right?
[11768.09s -> 11771.37s]  I mean, I know i'm saying the things that you've already heard but we have to we have to say it
[11771.37s -> 11774.09s]  We have to think about it. We got to talk about it. Don't be fucking careful
[11774.65s -> 11777.27s]  Take care of yourselves wash your hands
[11777.35s -> 11789.11s]  Don't get too close to anybody right? Just don't spread the damn thing. That's the bad part. That's what yeah, that's what i'm saying
[11789.75s -> 11802.31s]  I'm blocking my neighborhood at a block party yesterday
[11804.46s -> 11811.69s]  What the hell are they doing?
[11812.17s -> 11813.77s]  That's
[11813.77s -> 11815.29s]  doesn't make any sense
[11815.29s -> 11820.82s]  Hey, you know this like this big virus going around that like it's really starting to cases are starting to
[11821.70s -> 11823.94s]  Inflate in the in the country
[11824.66s -> 11830.10s]  You know what a great idea would be to like put myself with a bunch of other people
[11830.50s -> 11835.86s]  And as as many people as we can get in the same place and let's all sing songs out loud
[11843.24s -> 11845.24s]  That's like how it spreads
[11845.80s -> 11854.63s]  And I know and I know the thing is what i'm not gonna get it. I'm not gonna get it
[11855.27s -> 11858.63s]  Right, but if you if you touch the surface
[11859.27s -> 11864.63s]  Or you came into contact with the doorknob that had it on there and then you don't get it
[11865.03s -> 11867.03s]  But you give it to somebody else
[11867.90s -> 11869.58s]  And they get it
[11869.58s -> 11871.58s]  That's how this happens
[11880.09s -> 11883.45s]  You might not get it, but you might be the reason why 30 other people do
[11884.01s -> 11900.66s]  Sure, but you literally just kissed someone. No
[11906.17s -> 11909.37s]  Just be careful. Don't don't do any of that shit
[11909.45s -> 11914.65s]  There's no reason like i've seen like the photos of like the beaches and people are like fucking on the beach
[11918.46s -> 11921.50s]  Like let's hey, let's let's play tag on the beach
[11922.54s -> 11924.46s]  No, what are you doing?
[11924.46s -> 11933.46s]  Get go home
[11933.46s -> 11936.63s]  but anyways
[11936.63s -> 11940.55s]  I really hope that we can hit I we need to hit up we need to hit that
[11941.53s -> 11943.69s]  Flat like they say flatten it flatten it
[11944.65s -> 11946.33s]  We're gonna see more cases
[11946.33s -> 11953.45s]  But just we gotta fucking make it so hospitals don't get overrun by people. That's the main problem, right?
[11954.65s -> 11959.29s]  I know it's like oh, it's a it's like the flu. It's like a bad flu. It's a lot of a well
[11959.29s -> 11961.61s]  A lot of people say it's just like the bad flu. It's all good
[11962.49s -> 11969.46s]  yeah, but if when fucking a hundred thousand people in the same city get it at the same time and
[11971.04s -> 11974.98s]  20,000 of them need potentially to go to the emergency room
[11975.99s -> 11980.57s]  That's the problem
[11980.57s -> 11983.35s]  That's the issue
[11983.35s -> 11985.35s]  Right. It's a big part of it
[11998.06s -> 12000.06s]  People are dying from this. Yes, they are
[12001.40s -> 12010.28s]  It's not just old people. It's younger people too. It's mainly about making sure our hospitals don't get overrun
[12013.19s -> 12019.51s]  Because when you're out of beds and you're out of ventilators and and somebody comes in and they need one and you don't have one
[12020.60s -> 12024.31s]  You don't have a bed for that person
[12024.39s -> 12033.16s]  That's where it gets very bad
[12033.16s -> 12035.64s]  Yes, that's why it's important to stop the spread now. Yes
[12037.43s -> 12043.26s]  Exactly, you guys get it
[12043.26s -> 12047.10s]  I don't we don't I don't want to continue to we can move on from this but
[12049.67s -> 12054.23s]  It is good to talk about sometimes just to make sure kind of everybody's on the same page
[12055.80s -> 12058.04s]  It is a current fucking huge problem right now
[12058.68s -> 12066.31s]  Take care of yourselves
[12066.31s -> 12067.88s]  Wash your hands
[12067.88s -> 12077.54s]  Stay safe moving on we had 400 bits from sergeant chicken wing. Thank you for those
[12078.26s -> 12079.30s]  Four dollars
[12079.30s -> 12083.29s]  Jeremy kind of out of the loop since I missed a couple streams. Why all the short streams lately?
[12083.29s -> 12085.29s]  Are you moving again? Or did he miss something? Yes
[12085.61s -> 12088.49s]  Kim and I are in the process right now
[12088.81s -> 12092.68s]  of moving
[12092.68s -> 12098.04s]  We're anticipating we did a lot of stuff last week to get ready and start getting out
[12098.60s -> 12100.41s]  and over these next
[12100.41s -> 12103.77s]  Probably six to fifteen seven to fifteen days
[12105.03s -> 12108.15s]  We hope to be finally completely out completely
[12109.29s -> 12114.49s]  the issue and the reason why it hasn't happened already is because because of what we were just talking about with the coronavirus
[12115.67s -> 12118.04s]  A lot of stuff is a lot slower
[12118.20s -> 12122.04s]  whether that be trying to find apartments or a house to go to or
[12123.37s -> 12127.45s]  It's services that you need it for a for a new place it it's
[12128.01s -> 12139.16s]  Everything's very slowed down a lot. So it's we're trying to do it as best we can no more webcams. No
[12140.62s -> 12143.34s]  If las vegas is so good, how come there's no las vegas too?
[12143.98s -> 12152.73s]  Why would they need to be on what?
[12152.73s -> 12154.73s]  but that's why they've been shorter I
[12155.83s -> 12157.43s]  anticipate
[12157.43s -> 12159.50s]  that the
[12159.50s -> 12163.37s]  after this coming weekend, so let's say
[12164.92s -> 12166.44s]  after like
[12166.44s -> 12171.56s]  Somewhere around the the first week of april second week of april. I plan to be back to normal
[12172.36s -> 12174.44s]  with streaming and that means
[12175.99s -> 12183.24s]  Obviously streams that are more than four hours long back to kind of that normal like six to seven six to eight
[12183.96s -> 12186.86s]  We'll see that's that's the plan
[12186.86s -> 12194.78s]  but also
[12194.78s -> 12198.31s]  There's nothing to consider
[12198.31s -> 12200.66s]  I might try
[12200.66s -> 12207.42s]  Something in the future here when this is all said and done typically this stream is live
[12208.38s -> 12213.69s]  Three or four times a week for about six to eight hours, right?
[12214.57s -> 12218.07s]  I was thinking
[12218.07s -> 12219.74s]  maybe
[12219.74s -> 12221.74s]  What if that turned into?
[12221.82s -> 12224.22s]  like four or five days a week
[12225.43s -> 12226.68s]  but
[12226.68s -> 12231.14s]  Pulled back to about three or four hours a stream. I was trying to think of
[12231.86s -> 12236.44s]  And that though there's a reason why the only reason why I say this is because
[12237.32s -> 12239.00s]  The last three or four days
[12239.00s -> 12245.05s]  Remember we talked about how about the costochondritis and this potential like arthritis shit is like fucking me up
[12246.94s -> 12248.94s]  Sitting down for more than a few hours
[12250.33s -> 12252.81s]  When I get up after these three four hours streams
[12254.14s -> 12256.30s]  I feel okay. I feel all right
[12257.24s -> 12265.19s]  and I think that sitting down and being in the same place for more than six seven eight plus hours is
[12266.65s -> 12269.05s]  I think it's not helping. Let's just put it that way
[12270.44s -> 12275.24s]  And until I can have some type of solution where I have a standing desk where I can really just move around
[12277.24s -> 12278.92s]  I might try it
[12278.92s -> 12284.23s]  Maybe I haven't made a decision on it yet, but I was thinking about it
[12287.34s -> 12293.90s]  You know like four or five days a week for like three to five hour streams instead of three days a week eight hour streams
[12295.10s -> 12299.83s]  Or eight plus whatever you want to call them. I'm trying to figure it out
[12303.59s -> 12305.35s]  Do yoga breaks?
[12305.35s -> 12307.75s]  Yeah, the thing is though when you get into something
[12308.71s -> 12312.07s]  If i'm gonna sit here and stream and i'm into something and i'm having fun. I want to stick around it
[12313.91s -> 12318.47s]  Take getting up for 20 minutes and is that's it takes throws me off
[12319.67s -> 12321.67s]  Like i'd like to just kind of sit here and do what I want to do
[12322.23s -> 12330.36s]  I have not decided that that's gonna happen, but it's something that's floating around. Just want to let you know
[12334.98s -> 12336.98s]  Yeah, it would be more frequent but shorter
[12338.25s -> 12342.46s]  Rather than less frequent but longer we'll move on
[12343.99s -> 12348.95s]  Uh, thank you the sticky stick man for the 250. Hey germa first time catching the end of a stream from over here in europe
[12349.51s -> 12355.27s]  Thanks for keeping us entertained during this tough time. Hope all goes well with the move. Stay healthy you as well. Thank you for
[12356.70s -> 12357.82s]  kind words
[12357.82s -> 12365.56s]  I need to gain muscle and eat properly. I I I eat I eat fine
[12366.12s -> 12368.36s]  I eat at least two green vegetables every day
[12369.61s -> 12373.80s]  And they come out it comes out of a can but I still eat them. All right, let's do the credits
[12374.52s -> 12376.90s]  I'm gonna bump you. Whoops
[12376.90s -> 12382.60s]  Thanks for watching everybody. We'll see you on friday for hopefully the webcam
[12383.22s -> 12385.80s]  insanity stream
[12385.80s -> 12388.14s]  If I can get them
[12388.14s -> 12390.22s]  If I can figure out how to get those
[12391.32s -> 12402.41s]  If not, then we'll do something else. Of course, let's run the credits. You should see them any second
[12402.73s -> 12405.86s]  These are all the subs from today
[12406.42s -> 12411.96s]  plum today
[12411.96s -> 12416.92s]  Even with a three hour stream still a shitload of people subscribe, which is insane. Thank you guys
[12421.86s -> 12423.86s]  Thanks for the continued support
[12423.86s -> 12429.22s]  If you guys give a lot of money as always. Thank you
[12429.86s -> 12434.38s]  Is it only three hours? Yes, about three hours and 30 minutes if you count
[12435.42s -> 12446.31s]  The end of the stream here 25 minutes. Thank you one blondie for the 300 bits germa. I love you
[12447.38s -> 12460.20s]  Do you though do you are you sure you do you sure you know, are you sure about that love is a strong word
[12461.48s -> 12473.62s]  Are you still at 10k subs? No, no crossing that threshold was fucking ludicrous
[12475.99s -> 12477.99s]  So it is we've since come down
[12483.11s -> 12485.11s]  But still even after losing
[12485.91s -> 12491.99s]  Those subs from new years is still a shitload of people that is subbed to the channel. There's still a ton
[12496.36s -> 12498.04s]  like
[12498.12s -> 12503.08s]  It's just it's still increasing. Let's just put it that way and it's blows my fucking mind
[12506.81s -> 12508.73s]  What are we at now? Let's see. Let's just tell you
[12510.39s -> 12514.70s]  Uh, we are at we've been we've been hovering
[12516.25s -> 12518.22s]  this channel
[12518.22s -> 12520.22s]  uh, it is
[12521.64s -> 12524.95s]  7,800 holy shit. Yeah, so we've come down from 10
[12525.75s -> 12527.03s]  but
[12527.03s -> 12529.03s]  7,800 subs is still
[12529.75s -> 12532.07s]  a monumental amount of paid subscriptions
[12536.92s -> 12541.40s]  Even if it anything there's a lot of people that's a lot of subscriptions
[12548.44s -> 12554.22s]  Somebody said dead channel. Oh my god. Okay, it was
[12559.53s -> 12564.30s]  That's fucking funny
[12564.30s -> 12569.98s]  No, I can't I every time I open up my stream manager guys and I look at that I go that's fucking why?
[12570.54s -> 12572.54s]  That's a lot. That's a that's too many
[12573.10s -> 12578.46s]  That's too many people that are okay. That's a that's a lot and then I hit the broadcast button
[12582.55s -> 12584.06s]  anyways
[12584.06s -> 12587.66s]  Let's uh, we got one more message to get to just came in right now
[12588.22s -> 12594.78s]  Somebody's gonna fucking scream by the house. That's fine. See you guys on friday
[12595.42s -> 12600.38s]  And we have tar alecran one of the band. Wait, did I ever unban tar? I think I did right?
[12600.62s -> 12606.22s]  Thanks for 250. First of all, they say germa. Hi, it's tar here when you banned yesterday because you streamed
[12606.62s -> 12608.94s]  Despite my prediction that you wouldn't for the record
[12608.94s -> 12614.46s]  My original statement was the odds of germa moving and streaming by the end of the week are less than zero
[12614.70s -> 12621.24s]  Which was proven 1000 true since you didn't even move. I can't believe you even banned me temporarily
[12621.24s -> 12625.40s]  You're a disgraceful streamer. There was no sense of justice or honor. Yes
[12625.40s -> 12629.08s]  Love the stream been subbed for 42 months now waiting for my three-year badge, please
[12629.88s -> 12640.33s]  Did you see the I got I got the book thrown at me. Wait, why did this not what?
[12641.21s -> 12647.13s]  Oh, sorry, I fucked that up. They end up again for calling you out
[12647.61s -> 12649.16s]  Well, I can't do that
[12649.16s -> 12654.44s]  I mean like we just both walked out of the courtroom with our luggage and shit under our arms and different lawyers
[12655.53s -> 12659.05s]  Well, I can't what am I gonna I can't sue you if you win the case
[12659.93s -> 12662.73s]  And we walk out together from and we both you okay
[12663.37s -> 12667.37s]  It's over you have been found guilty when I walk out if you look at me and like go
[12668.17s -> 12670.17s]  Stick your tongue out and go ha ha
[12671.00s -> 12673.96s]  Like what am I gonna bring bring him back in? I want to sue him for that
[12674.68s -> 12677.24s]  Can you bring him back in? I want to sue him for for that
[12677.88s -> 12685.05s]  No, that's not how it works
[12685.05s -> 12687.29s]  guilty in a civil case omega low
[12688.25s -> 12694.25s]  Despite sue a spite sue
[12697.78s -> 12699.78s]  Oh, I i'll fucking sue you
[12700.66s -> 12703.54s]  I'll sue you motherfucker. Just wait
[12704.42s -> 12710.94s]  All right, let's write somebody who you won't see me for a few days
[12711.74s -> 12718.89s]  We got key. Oh key. Oh key. Well, I never catch key. Well every streaming
[12721.77s -> 12723.77s]  Uh key was awesome
[12724.33s -> 12729.13s]  Because I never I never end my streams
[12730.90s -> 12733.54s]  Anytime where people you are actually playing?
[12734.50s -> 12741.67s]  Yeah, we'll raid kilo. Let's say hello. What's she doing? She's doing granted out of five
