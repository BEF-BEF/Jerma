[3.06s -> 15.07s]  I mean, the universe is such a large place, and it's a little disheartening that we don't spend more time and more effort with the research and development into certain things like the theory of relativity, for instance.
[15.07s -> 25.73s]  I mean, I'm not sure exactly why we don't spend that much money. I would implore the Congress and the Senate to do that, and it truly is a beautiful thing.
[26.33s -> 29.46s]  Did I just kill that many-
[30.22s -> 47.58s]  What is this? Look at how dirty this is. Like, it's like a- this was in my pocket, by the way, of these pants. You can't see them.
[47.58s -> 54.27s]  I have no- I must have like blown my nose in that and like wiped it on the concrete.
[54.79s -> 61.37s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2. It's been a while since the last Facecam Fortress, but let's go, cow man, let's-
[61.81s -> 73.80s]  Okay, I'm gonna show this to you because this doesn't make any sense. I don't know if I can get this in the camera.
[73.96s -> 82.70s]  This is my keyboard. That's my jump button. Can you-
[85.22s -> 89.78s]  How do they get those pita pockets? You know the little pita pockets that they make that you get at the grocery store?
[90.14s -> 96.46s]  How do they put those inside the pita? Like, how do they make the bread like that? That's- they can't make it.
[96.46s -> 100.42s]  It's impossible. Like, you need the dough to settle. You need there to be-
[101.18s -> 104.22s]  Am I missing? I'm missing. You need the dough.
[106.49s -> 112.57s]  I can't believe I'm- you know, the dough seriously needs to settle and I don't know what kind of dough you use,
[112.57s -> 118.49s]  but the dough that I use is truly- it sucks. It doesn't rise correctly. It smells a little bit.
[118.49s -> 120.49s]  It smells kind of like cheese and farts.
[175.27s -> 195.29s]  Come on. Somebody come over here. Somebody just walk over here right now. Come on. I could wait all day.
[195.95s -> 225.21s]  Get plenty of coffee. Got plenty of time. At least I killed somebody with that. This is the face I make.
[226.82s -> 237.16s]  When I'm really fucking mad. Now I'm mad. You made me fucking mad. Now it's time to show you
[238.60s -> 252.20s]  how we do things. Get behind enemy lines and start stabbing. Get like a nine-person chain stab.
[253.96s -> 263.88s]  Nobody up there. No snipers. What about back here? The only person on like red team is this like poor heavy.
[264.20s -> 269.69s]  That's about to- you know, we're not gonna kill this guy. I'm not gonna kill this guy. Yeah. Hey, what's up, man?
[270.25s -> 277.27s]  Got that health? He's like, huh? What was that? Who was that? Was that a spy?
[277.83s -> 280.31s]  I love how he's spy checking these guys, but not me.
[281.82s -> 287.99s]  Come on. Come on. Walk right into that crosshair. It wasn't the same guy, but it's okay.
[290.23s -> 293.51s]  I don't want to get shot in the face. That's the number one thing I don't want to have happen
[293.51s -> 295.51s]  accidentally by one of these snipers.
[300.31s -> 303.99s]  There was three and we lost because I wasn't capping the point, but
[304.63s -> 310.15s]  come on. Get it. Come on. Kill me baby. Baby speed. Come on. Turn around. Please turn around.
[310.79s -> 317.02s]  Turn around, please. Shoot me. Shoot me. I'm trying to walk in front of him.
[319.56s -> 326.15s]  Oh my god.
[330.15s -> 335.43s]  No, there's another one. There's two. Oh, no, they're gonna double team me.
[337.24s -> 343.70s]  Hold on a second.
[345.45s -> 348.65s]  They both have get this is on. They both just like
[348.73s -> 364.20s]  Like
[377.10s -> 389.54s]  Head shot. Head shot. Head shot. Oh, and he landed and died. Get another head shot. Excuse me. What would you like?
[390.42s -> 392.42s]  No, it's a pyro and he's gonna get me.
[394.58s -> 396.58s]  I'm burning. It's over. I burnt.
[396.82s -> 402.04s]  Star Wars killed me. George Lucas presents Star Wars.
[402.68s -> 410.55s]  Gets the kill on Jerma or Greg. Are we really getting this badly destroyed right now?
[410.55s -> 415.48s]  We didn't even cap it once. How did this even happen? I don't even know. How did we do that?
[417.16s -> 424.86s]  What?
[424.86s -> 432.15s]  Yeah
[432.15s -> 433.80s]  Yes
[433.80s -> 434.76s]  Yes
[434.76s -> 443.99s]  Yes. Yes. Thank you so much for watching everybody. I really do appreciate it. I don't know what three health great
[444.07s -> 447.43s]  I'm i'm very good at that. I'm very good. I i'm very good to
[448.31s -> 450.42s]  redo
[450.42s -> 457.82s]  redo just cut that out just slight just take in the file in the video file and they cut
[458.30s -> 460.30s]  And then drag that piece
[460.62s -> 465.18s]  To to the other piece to get rid of that fucking part talking to you Jerma
[465.99s -> 468.55s]  Don't leave this in don't accidentally leave this in
[468.55s -> 473.19s]  I know you're gonna accidentally leave this in and the people are gonna say you accidentally left this part in
[474.54s -> 479.66s]  And then i'm gonna say what are you even talking about? I didn't I didn't leave it in
[480.22s -> 488.28s]  I was just now i'm seriously being an idiot. Thank you so much for watching really do appreciate it guys. Oh my god
