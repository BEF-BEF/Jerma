[24.06s -> 32.17s]  So I'm looking at my phone and so I apparently never tweeted last night. I didn't tweet last
[32.17s -> 36.86s]  night. Yesterday. So I opened up my phone. This is the first time I've opened my phone.
[38.36s -> 42.28s]  And I'm pretty sure like the entire 24 hour period since yesterday.
[43.16s -> 49.10s]  And it's just Twitter is open with the tweet from yesterday. So I just have to delete a few lines
[49.10s -> 57.72s]  and I'm ready to go. Look at this. I'm just gonna write. Oh, it's at X. It's at PS1. I'm gonna write
[57.72s -> 129.42s]  Xbox time. It's like already done for me. This is perfect. All right. Okay. How you doing? How are
[129.42s -> 143.38s]  you? So today we have the X, the original Xbox is set up, ready to go. I have been playing. Oh,
[143.38s -> 148.26s]  my mic cut out. Oh, whoops. That's because I'm delayed by like a full second. That's right.
[148.26s -> 158.62s]  So I'm on the original Xbox. It's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this is because
[159.34s -> 165.34s]  there are actually a lot of games that are not backwards compatible with the 360 or with any
[165.34s -> 173.18s]  of the newer consoles. So some of these kind of just got like lost forever. And I have,
[173.18s -> 179.96s]  I'd say half of the games that half of the Xbox are like that. They're still here at some here
[179.96s -> 184.63s]  that work on the 360, but we've got the original set up. Let's see how long it takes us to go
[184.63s -> 192.22s]  through the originals. So first up, which is kind of surprising that you can't really play
[192.22s -> 197.50s]  it anywhere. But I think it's on PC, but it's like a Windows. It's an old Windows game,
[199.61s -> 207.86s]  very old Windows game. So trying to get the old like Windows, what Windows 2000.
[227.26s -> 236.62s]  Okay. Sorry. So he's fake typing. No, I'm not. Why would I? I'm real typing. Why would I fake
[236.62s -> 252.01s]  type? No reason. Please see your evil face. No. But anyway, so what was the same? Okay.
[252.01s -> 257.13s]  So a lot of these old Xbox games cannot run on the 360. I have a 360,
[257.13s -> 261.21s]  but some of these don't work. So I've owned some of these games for four or five years.
[261.21s -> 266.09s]  They've been sitting on a shelf because it's like, oh, fuck. I can't play these on the 360.
[266.09s -> 270.97s]  I thought 360 was backwards compatible. Maybe one day I'll get an original Xbox somehow.
[272.09s -> 277.53s]  Maybe I'll do it. But here's that day today. We're there now. You are about to see
[278.49s -> 284.26s]  games that are no longer available. So that's a, that's not true. You could probably, I mean,
[287.02s -> 289.74s]  look, I know that this is going to be, somebody's going to be like, whoa, what about just get an
[289.74s -> 297.08s]  emulator? It's original hardware. I like original hardware because, I mean, yeah, emulators are
[297.08s -> 306.68s]  great, but there's this period of emulation where once you hit the PS2 and PS3 arrow, like that PS2
[306.68s -> 315.16s]  Xbox into PS3, a lot of games have a ton of problems on emulators. They're, they get messed
[315.16s -> 318.68s]  up. There's tons of bugs. There's graphical problems. You got to like, oh, no, no, no.
[318.68s -> 325.05s]  The problem is you need a different BIOS. I don't want to do all that. PS3 emulation is
[325.05s -> 330.25s]  actually pretty great now. I hope that's cool because it wasn't a few years ago when I, you
[330.25s -> 334.73s]  know, three, four years ago, but also I also, I don't know if the game is still available
[335.94s -> 340.02s]  and like, I, if I can play it on the original hardware, I'm going to, if it's not, then of,
[340.02s -> 346.65s]  and of course I have a different opinion, right? But we're, we're on original hardware today.
[346.65s -> 355.27s]  When are you going to play boom blocks? This dude is lawful neutral.
[357.93s -> 367.82s]  That's what you took out of that. Oh, he's lawful neutral. No, I'm not. Am I? What's that mean?
[377.22s -> 386.28s]  Lawful neutral Andy. No, I'm not, I'm not chaotic neutral. I'm not going to say that. I'm,
[386.28s -> 398.73s]  I'm really not even that chaotic. I'm really not. All right. Give me one more second. Uh,
[398.73s -> 455.21s]  we're going to be wearing a turtleneck. Why would I be wearing a turtleneck right now? All right.
[455.21s -> 460.34s]  I'm going to get started. Let's go. It's time to play the matrix. That's the first game I've got.
[460.34s -> 465.62s]  It's enter the matrix. Weirdly enough, this game never got any, it's probably, honestly, a lot of
[465.62s -> 476.41s]  this is probably for licensing problems, right? You have to imagine that some of these did not
[476.41s -> 482.02s]  get ported to the newer consoles because of that. Why did somebody just write? Ha ha ha ha ha. Why
[482.02s -> 489.05s]  did you do that? Explain it. This game rules and I'm on original hardware. So this is, oh yeah,
[489.05s -> 496.89s]  baby. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. No more stalling. I'm ready to go. Can you do an agent
[496.89s -> 511.10s]  Smith impression? Mr. Anderson, it seems I am not the only spy. You are in deep trouble, Mr.
[511.10s -> 517.16s]  Anderson. Pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good. You know what was really cool about what just
[517.16s -> 521.48s]  happened right there? That was the same audio clip three times in a row. And I just did it
[521.48s -> 526.60s]  just from my mouth. That was fucking awesome. And I'm going to, I will die on that hill. That was
[526.60s -> 531.58s]  actually really interesting. What just happened that there was no difference in how I said all
[531.58s -> 535.98s]  three of those. It was perfect each time, the same exact audio clip. And it was me talking.
[535.98s -> 543.82s]  I win the argument by the way. It was no argument. All right, let's go. Let's go. I made sure this
[543.82s -> 551.11s]  was playing the whole time because I was so afraid of the screen burning it. This trailer
[551.11s -> 556.33s]  has been going on for, oh my goodness. It's got to be at least 20, 30 minutes at this point.
[558.57s -> 565.53s]  I've just been playing this. So I've had to sit here and listen to this a while. All right,
[565.53s -> 572.14s]  you guys ready? You said you weren't chaotic. What's chaotic about saying pretty good three
[572.14s -> 580.20s]  times in like a cool voice? I think that's pretty lawful neutral. That's, that's 100%
[580.20s -> 585.24s]  just neutral, right? Like I just said it perfectly. If I was chaotic, I would have said it differently
[585.24s -> 596.92s]  three different times. I win. All right, let's go. New game. I'm not playing on hard. All right,
[596.92s -> 603.19s]  we're doing the no save file. Let's go. That matrix save is good enough for me.
[603.35s -> 608.76s]  Your account do hacking. No, I'm not. I want to play. Why is this in 320p? Because I'm on
[608.76s -> 617.45s]  is the burn in from there from last night. No, but I am actually so paranoid about it.
[617.45s -> 627.59s]  Let me check. Hold on. If I turn this off. No, it's not there. Thankfully. All right, quiet.
[648.33s -> 649.05s]  This isn't a movie.
[659.03s -> 677.70s]  I haven't seen the move. I haven't seen the matrix hidden. All right, I, I saw the first
[677.70s -> 686.33s]  matrix. I saw the second matrix and then I didn't see the third one. Stop watching this.
[687.51s -> 695.85s]  It's part of the video game. That's fine. This is exclusive footage. What the fuck? Quiet. Stop
[695.85s -> 699.86s]  talking. Just got out of the post office. Is the drop still clean?
[702.55s -> 709.93s]  Naomi, this won't be easy. I'm not just watching the matrix. I swear that is what's my friend.
[710.49s -> 717.77s]  I knew him. He never used to drop before. He didn't trust him. Whatever's in that box costs
[717.77s -> 722.90s]  that he has his life in the lives of his crew. And I have a feeling if we don't get to it first,
[722.90s -> 727.22s]  it's going to cost us a whole lot more. So are you red or blue on this?
[727.22s -> 736.66s]  Yes. You know me, Naomi. It's not a choice. Wait, didn't, don't you already have to take the pill
[736.66s -> 742.26s]  to do this in the first place? Wait, I thought they already took the pill to be able to be in
[742.26s -> 746.18s]  this universe or something. I know how valued my opinion is on this ship. I won't bother to tell
[746.18s -> 750.82s]  you, but I think it's insane for you not to wait for a support team. And for the record,
[750.82s -> 755.22s]  when I cart your bodies back to Zion, I prefer cremation or the gardens. Sparks,
[755.54s -> 762.10s]  balls. No, because this is flipped. It's all both ways. Then can you shut up and hit the button?
[762.10s -> 767.06s]  Your wish captain. My captain is my keystroke colon double backslash execute command.
[768.10s -> 794.23s]  Okay. Oh, okay. Pick. I'll pick ghost. Why do you do that? Do what? Check your guns.
[794.23s -> 800.39s]  I can turn it up. It's a program. They get loaded every time the exact same way.
[800.39s -> 804.55s]  Hume teaches us that no matter how many times you drop a stone and it falls to the floor,
[806.07s -> 809.59s]  you never know what will happen the next time you drop it. It might fall to the floor,
[809.59s -> 815.14s]  but then again, it might float to the ceiling. Past experience can never prove the future.
[816.02s -> 828.18s]  So, so you never know. Here we go. Cool. All right. It's time. I would doesn't matter how
[828.18s -> 832.10s]  many times that happens. It was scared the shit out of me every time post office closes. There's
[832.10s -> 837.46s]  a ton of heat in the area, but the package is still untouched. Box number is seven three one
[837.46s -> 842.34s]  two two two. Got it. And hey, can you ask ghost if he doesn't make it? Can I have his boots?
[842.34s -> 848.41s]  To me, it's kind of like when a plane lands, when you're just like, you know, I've flown planes
[848.41s -> 852.09s]  hundreds of times at this point, right? And the plane is like landing and it's just like,
[853.62s -> 856.50s]  okay, we're okay. Right? Like everybody kind of has that moment.
[865.13s -> 867.93s]  It doesn't matter how many times you fly a plane. It doesn't matter.
[869.85s -> 877.62s]  There's that one second moment where you're just like, and that's it. And that's it. And you're
[877.62s -> 889.21s]  fine. Save matrix. Yeah. Is it burnt in? No, it's not. No. Why did he just check? No, that's fine.
[889.21s -> 900.22s]  All right. Let's do it. Xbox night. The instant messaging window below is where
[900.22s -> 906.90s]  me message will appear from your operator sparks. All right. What's what do I have to do?
[909.69s -> 915.24s]  I didn't get it. I thought I didn't get a tutorial. What the fuck is happening?
[915.88s -> 923.50s]  I don't know. I don't know how to play. All right. Where do I go?
[930.86s -> 936.20s]  New tip fighting multiple enemies. What? What do you mean tip? I didn't even tell me how to play.
[941.66s -> 953.53s]  All right. What do I do? All right. That way. How do I play? Okay. What was the mission? Okay.
[953.53s -> 961.14s]  That's punch this combos. All right. Cool. You're supposed to read the manual and I don't have time
[961.14s -> 973.59s]  for that. I don't. Okay. I have gone to, how do I open doors? It's just, dude, just, just kicking
[973.59s -> 979.30s]  punch. Don't care who cares. Don't worry about anything else. Wait, press the action button to
[979.30s -> 989.54s]  activate switches. That's the telephone. This is blocked. Read the manual. There's no manual guys.
[989.54s -> 1000.87s]  I don't have a manual. Oh, it's okay. That's locked. That's locked. Should I restart? Did I
[1000.87s -> 1038.94s]  do something wrong? Why are you so violent? What does it say? Kick the doors open. Okay. What do
[1038.94s -> 1046.92s]  I do? Stop asking the question and play. What? Why am I doing this? Why am I asking you everything?
[1047.56s -> 1060.34s]  Just walk around and figure it out. What am I talking about? I didn't like that was in one ear.
[1074.84s -> 1084.12s]  What did he say? Okay. Pause menu and select objective. Oh, here we go. First person mode.
[1084.12s -> 1089.56s]  You can view the environment from a first person. Press enter exit. First person to enter first
[1089.56s -> 1094.60s]  person. Enter exit first person again. What? What? I can't even read the sentence.
[1094.60s -> 1098.68s]  You can view the environment from a first person view for the eyes of your character.
[1098.68s -> 1104.04s]  Press enter exit first person to enter first person mode. Press enter exit first person again.
[1104.04s -> 1114.65s]  What button is that on the Xbox? They didn't tell me what button it is. I have X, Y, B, A,
[1115.74s -> 1119.66s]  left. Oh, first person mode. There it is. Sorry. First person exit enter.
[1122.26s -> 1133.21s]  Okay. You can punch. You can kick when running from agents to exit hand to hand combo. Either press
[1133.21s -> 1140.47s]  move away from the enemy. Press fire or press first. I need to see these controls. Multiple
[1140.47s -> 1145.51s]  enemies at once from nearby all angles. Tap movement. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I need the
[1145.51s -> 1156.25s]  con- there we go. Focus movement. Weapons menu. Pause weapon select. Target lock. Action. Where's
[1156.25s -> 1176.60s]  it? Okay. First person. Cool. All right. Let's go. What box was it? Second floor upstairs.
[1177.16s -> 1184.22s]  I found a way inside. Try the security door behind the clerk's desk.
[1184.22s -> 1201.30s]  Okay. How does this run? I'm in. I'm going to watch this whole stream on the toilet.
[1202.34s -> 1206.71s]  Make sure you stand up every so often because your circulation is going to get all fucking up to me.
[1220.49s -> 1233.08s]  I'm in. Why did you tell me to come to this door if you're not going to open it?
[1235.58s -> 1242.84s]  Why did he do that? Did you hear a word he said? Yeah, he said go to the freight
[1243.80s -> 1249.00s]  station somewhere over in the freight area. I don't know. I thought he was going to open a door.
[1249.80s -> 1263.64s]  Press fire to draw a weapon. Well, there is no bumper on the original Xbox.
[1264.44s -> 1286.92s]  What's fire? I don't have- I changed weapon, I thought. Wait, what's fire? Fire is-
[1287.48s -> 1293.58s]  What are these two weird buttons? What are these two weird buttons? What the hell are these?
[1293.66s -> 1302.90s]  Huh? There's- I- What are these two buttons? There's a white and black button? Holy shit,
[1302.90s -> 1314.66s]  I didn't know that. Look at this thing. There's two buttons here. I- They were invisible to me.
[1314.66s -> 1330.18s]  Why are you such a zoomer? I never had an Xbox. That's actually- I don't like pressing that all
[1330.18s -> 1338.60s]  the way down there. Stop. Put it away. That's so far away. This is the worst controller.
[1339.32s -> 1352.50s]  He has small hands? No, it's just- What is this? What a bad controller this is.
[1359.03s -> 1375.00s]  White and black were bumper equivalents. Really? Okay, well, what was that? Why are we in like this
[1375.00s -> 1390.30s]  split screen? How did I just do that? I don't know. This game is awesome. This is- What a fun game
[1390.30s -> 1396.98s]  this really is. How would this not- Why wouldn't they get the licensing figured out to get this
[1396.98s -> 1410.33s]  game on the 360 or something? What are they thinking? There's a PC version? Yeah, but PC
[1410.33s -> 1414.25s]  version, you have to jump through like 10 hoops to get it to run sometimes, especially on a new
[1414.25s -> 1419.45s]  computer. If it has like Windows 10, Windows 11, it's just like- You have to set up a virtual
[1419.45s -> 1451.37s]  machine at some point. Yuck. I missed so many times, but whatever. The climb fence is moved
[1451.37s -> 1471.40s]  toward the fence and your character will begin to automatically climb it. Shoot him. Shoot him.
[1472.12s -> 1500.42s]  Shoot him. What? I have no more ammo? Wait, these are- Okay, wait, these are-
[1503.02s -> 1511.43s]  What am I doing? What's the point of that? They just do that to that guy.
[1515.83s -> 1524.79s]  Dude, if you're in a full sprint like that, what do you do? Stop that. Stop doing that.
[1557.30s -> 1569.90s]  Special moves? Ow. Go over there and fight him. Go over and jump to him.
[1570.86s -> 1621.50s]  Wait, there's weapons. Wall press? I'm all right. How do I wall press? Reload firearms. I don't know.
[1622.06s -> 1695.75s]  Shoot around corners. How do I get out of this? Oh, I got him. This game is so fun. All right,
[1695.75s -> 1703.85s]  cool. This game's fun. Grenade.
[1712.20s -> 1716.28s]  Stay above the gas. The cops are sealing the doors. Where's Niobe? She's trying to find a way
[1716.28s -> 1720.92s]  into the building. You're flying solo. Stay above the gas and find a way out of it. Yeah.
[1722.34s -> 1729.32s]  Stay above the gas and get out. How do I do that?
[1748.36s -> 1759.78s]  Where do I go? Stay above the gas? Wait, this room's not full of gas?
[1767.72s -> 1777.58s]  I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
[1778.54s -> 1783.19s]  Oh, the gas is in here. All right. I was confused. I got confused. I got confused. It's fine.
[1784.65s -> 1789.29s]  First, I wasn't getting hit by the gas and then I was hit by the gas. I get it. I understand.
[1789.29s -> 1840.71s]  It takes me a second. I was too busy making the dumb joke. I got it. Jesus. Whoa. Pretty sick.
[1849.85s -> 1862.65s]  All right. Here's the help. Oh, I just punched him right in the throat.
[1866.14s -> 1880.22s]  Okay. Now I'm not messing around. All right. The gas is over here somewhere. Shoot him. What
[1880.22s -> 1907.13s]  are you doing? Just attack somebody. What are you doing? You need to wall run. Damn it. How
[1907.13s -> 1915.48s]  do I do that? Face an object such as a wall, then tap movement forward as if to walk into the wall.
[1915.48s -> 1922.78s]  Your character will turn their back and press up against the object. Okay. Wall press. Wall run.
[1923.50s -> 1930.38s]  Is this correct? When a wall press, strafe left and right or move left and right to move along
[1930.38s -> 1955.99s]  the object. Okay. Cool. All right. I get it. All right. Let's do it. Don't turn around and
[1955.99s -> 1980.15s]  and go the wrong way. So the correct way is over there. Where am I going? I don't understand.
[1981.19s -> 1984.65s]  But I'm going to go out of this gas down here. Can I jump on this?
[1985.53s -> 2007.64s]  Need to use focus. Climb up the fence. Get up there. What are you doing? I don't get it.
[2008.36s -> 2018.42s]  Somebody said I hated this level when I was a kid. Where are these vents?
[2024.41s -> 2048.63s]  What? I don't think this is correct. Go back. Go back. I don't want to. I don't want to do this
[2048.63s -> 2051.83s]  again. I really don't want to do this level again. I don't want to do it again. I really don't.
[2052.71s -> 2084.41s]  I just had three arms. Ow. Look for us. Skylight. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get down. Get
[2084.41s -> 2093.06s]  down. Get down. Hey, get off the first person. You idiot. Skylight. Ah, holy shit. I made it.
[2093.06s -> 2114.73s]  Okay, we're good. I have 2% health. Did I soft lock myself? I hope not. Is there health anywhere?
[2115.29s -> 2146.44s]  There's no health. I have to actually be stealthy. I didn't even fucking see me coming.
[2147.08s -> 2191.50s]  I just shot myself in the face. Hey, wait, wait. What are you doing? Oh shit. Oh shit. That's
[2191.50s -> 2198.89s]  fucked. That would be the quickest way for you to die. This dude is fucked up.
[2201.27s -> 2207.77s]  I'm coming through the grate. No, you're not, man. You're not going to make it.
[2207.77s -> 2217.35s]  If I sit here long enough, it'll recharge. Just anger overtook this character. I'm going to get
[2217.35s -> 2227.98s]  through that chain link fence. I'm saying happy birthday. Okay, wait. I'm waiting until full health.
[2227.98s -> 2268.41s]  I'm not messing this up. Holy shit. I just destroyed that guy. That was awesome.
[2269.85s -> 2272.09s]  Health is recharging. I'm not going to be stupid. This game is hard.
[2286.38s -> 2290.94s]  Just run by. I can't hurt. I can't hit them. Wait, what about behind the energy drink container?
[2296.63s -> 2307.59s]  No, go. Just run. I'm good.
[2329.03s -> 2330.23s]  The 85th birthday.
[2330.23s -> 2333.51s]  There was once a jail or bank or something. I need some guidance.
[2333.51s -> 2336.31s]  Oh, there should be a control room located very close by.
[2336.31s -> 2341.37s]  Find it. Call me back when you get there. This dude can't hear me through the wall.
[2341.37s -> 2381.43s]  It's a window. It's soundproof. Die through glass. Oh, no way. How do I do that?
[2381.43s -> 2423.59s]  Kick through glass windows by running. Okay. Make this fucking epic. What's with my health being so
[2424.31s -> 2476.84s]  reduced? Nice. Shoot this guy. What are you doing? Your character will automatically duck under low
[2476.84s -> 2509.06s]  hanging. Okay. How do I crouch? Is there a crouch? Dude, stop kicking. I put too many inputs in.
[2509.06s -> 2558.82s]  It's locked. Oh, hold on. Go. Can I talk? Is there a talk button? No, it's not talk.
[2559.38s -> 2572.31s]  I'm not going to do it. I need to power up the lobby elevator. There should be a switch somewhere
[2573.19s -> 2581.34s]  on the control panel. All right, guys. I had to come in and press the big button.
[2581.90s -> 2606.73s]  How's the audio? Is the audio still okay? You want to do a couple quick tests? Hello there.
[2606.73s -> 2624.25s]  My name is Jerma. Does it work? They say it's good, right? He just hit me right at the fault.
[2626.47s -> 2651.80s]  What was that? He just went like that. Okay. The combos. Who made this game?
[2652.68s -> 2677.98s]  Who made this? What company made this? Shiny? Shiny Entertainment? Because this is pretty good
[2678.54s -> 2682.86s]  for thinking about how it holds up. This actually kind of holds up pretty well.
[2684.63s -> 2702.15s]  This is fun. Wait, the Shiny Entertainment that made Earthworm Jim? Wait, Shiny Entertainment.
[2705.30s -> 2717.62s]  What? The devs that made Earthworm Jim made Enter the Matrix and MDK. You know what's crazy about MDK?
[2718.50s -> 2727.66s]  I remember that being on a demo disc way back in the day and I played that demo disc a million
[2727.66s -> 2745.85s]  times. I didn't even know what the game was. What happened to that guy? Yeah, there was level one
[2745.85s -> 2753.58s]  of MDK was on some old demo disc and I remember just playing it over and over. Those old demo
[2753.66s -> 2762.68s]  discs were so awesome. Do you know how many times I played level one of Parappa the Rapper?
[2763.67s -> 2788.98s]  It had to have been hundreds of times. All right, let's go. Were they awesome sauce or just regular
[2788.98s -> 2801.66s]  awesome? Please do a demo disc night. I feel like it wouldn't hit as hard as it did back a long time
[2801.66s -> 2828.74s]  ago. Do it, please. Oh, this is a long first level. I feel like I've been here this like
[2829.46s -> 2852.52s]  tutorial level. Where are they going? What? Let's go. You used to get them in magazines.
[2853.74s -> 2864.17s]  Yeah, you know, I might be just completely speaking totally completely out of line here,
[2865.22s -> 2870.76s]  but do video games really do anything kind of funny and fun like that anymore? Not funny,
[2870.76s -> 2874.52s]  but you know what I mean? Like, oh, looks like a little thing we're going to put in the box.
[2875.74s -> 2881.83s]  People don't really have a box, right? Like, oh, here's like a preview for and it was weird
[2881.83s -> 2885.91s]  because some wasn't it sometimes it'd be like two discs in the PlayStation one case.
[2886.47s -> 2900.26s]  It's like, oh, here's, by the way, here's like some weird DVD extras. Like, oh, cool. No, good
[2900.26s -> 2907.27s]  riddance. What? You don't want like some fun thing just to kind of browse around when you're
[2907.27s -> 2922.36s]  just kind of bored one day? Why? What do you mean good riddance? That's DLC now. A special edition
[2922.36s -> 2927.70s]  of Halo 2 and 3 had extra discs. It was awesome with behind the scenes stuff. Hold on, I gotta
[2927.70s -> 2943.27s]  pay attention for a second. I have an unbelievably brilliant idea and I don't want to tell anybody
[2943.27s -> 2948.84s]  because it's so good that I feel like somebody would steal it. I might just figure out how to
[2948.84s -> 2958.28s]  do it one day. It's actually like a 100 out of 100 on a point scale for like how cool this would be.
[2958.28s -> 2967.02s]  I wish people would do it. I can't tell you because somebody's going to hear this and you'll be on
[2967.02s -> 2970.78s]  Shark Tank in two weeks and I'll be like, that was my shit and I shouldn't have said it.
[2979.13s -> 2989.05s]  That's such a weird flex. I'm telling you, I have an unbelievable idea and it's so good. It's so
[2989.05s -> 2995.72s]  good. It makes me angry that nobody did it yet. It makes me fucking mad that nobody's done it yet
[2995.72s -> 3006.98s]  and it's there's only two people on earth that know what this is. Ollie and Otto. I told Otto
[3006.98s -> 3028.18s]  very very detailed information about this. Otto is a spy. Dude, one time,
[3029.62s -> 3037.16s]  this is completely unrelated but it's just so stupid. One time, so I like, okay,
[3039.42s -> 3042.14s]  I don't want this to burn in. I have to do something. I have to like literally run in a
[3042.14s -> 3050.68s]  circle. It's so annoying that I have to do that. It's gonna be hard to talk. I don't care. Okay,
[3050.68s -> 3058.79s]  so I like to, it's a new hobby that I have. I'll tell you about my hobby. So I like to collect
[3058.79s -> 3064.79s]  at this point right now playing cards. I like cards, you know, like ace, king, queen, jack.
[3066.04s -> 3071.46s]  There's so many different decks. There's so many cool things to kind of find and, oh wow, this like
[3071.46s -> 3075.42s]  there's so many different artwork that you can collect. There's so many different kinds of styles
[3075.42s -> 3079.61s]  and it's fun. It's fun. They're not that expensive. It's just like, okay, cool.
[3079.85s -> 3086.46s]  You're a psycho. Yeah, some people collect coins. I like playing cards. Let him cook. Exactly. Let me
[3086.46s -> 3096.22s]  cook. So sometimes it's fun just to kind of play cards on the couch. It's like, you know, like
[3096.22s -> 3103.18s]  Polly's right here, I'm right here, and Otto is like asleep kind of on the couch over there,
[3103.18s -> 3112.58s]  like over here, like to the left, and we just deal Otto in and like we were playing poker.
[3112.58s -> 3118.97s]  It's just like, okay, like here you go. Here's your cards. Here's my cards. Here's Otto's cards.
[3118.97s -> 3124.23s]  And it got to a point where we just started laughing and we're just like, what are we doing?
[3124.23s -> 3129.83s]  Because it's like, oh, what do you got? Oh, no, no, I fold. Oh, this is what I got. And I look at
[3129.83s -> 3137.72s]  Otto's cards and I go, oh, Otto folds. He's just like lying on his side, just sleeping and snoring.
[3137.72s -> 3143.91s]  It's like he's not even participating. Why is he in? Why are we doing this? Like, oh, Otto folds.
[3144.79s -> 3155.13s]  Like, what was the point? This is that was that's cute. It's just for fun. I don't even care.
[3155.13s -> 3163.48s]  But anyways, this is fun. Like he's not giving like, oh, look, look, he's playing too. Isn't that
[3163.48s -> 3170.71s]  cute? Otto has no idea what the hell we're doing. He doesn't care at all. He's just asleep.
[3172.41s -> 3186.18s]  You should let Otto win. You should ban Otto. He counts cards. But anyways, yes, I've been,
[3186.26s -> 3191.80s]  I've been, I like, I don't have that many. I probably have seven or eight decks total.
[3191.80s -> 3200.60s]  It's fine. Some people collect coins. Some people collect. Look, all right. You know what? Some
[3200.60s -> 3206.52s]  people collect cars. I don't, not going to do that. I'll take the, I'll take the cards. Did I say,
[3206.52s -> 3212.95s]  what did I just say? Did I say? No. Yes. Some people collect cards. Cars. Right. I ain't doing
[3212.95s -> 3228.76s]  that. Okay. Jump from behind cover. Cool. You, hey, whatever you want to collect, that's up to you.
[3230.47s -> 3236.55s]  Go ahead and collect whatever you want. If it's cars, if it's coins, if it's playing cards,
[3236.55s -> 3243.54s]  if it's video games, people, old video games, collecting old video games, who's Otto?
[3253.21s -> 3283.99s]  I don't, I hate, I turn this off. Turn the sound off. That's really cool. Oh my goodness.
[3286.17s -> 3291.83s]  Dude, how do you fucking win? Dude, how do you, how do you win? There's too many people.
[3292.79s -> 3308.02s]  My God. Skill issue. People that don't have the context that Otto is a dog are confused.
[3308.02s -> 3318.10s]  Like there's just some guy, Otto, that's here. Oh, you know what? Otto folds. Just a guy lying
[3318.10s -> 3338.92s]  there. Otto is a dog. Otto is a, my Dachshund mix. Okay. Don't mess it up here. I'm just going to
[3338.92s -> 3343.88s]  hide. I'm going to hide in the corner. Just, yeah, that's the best way to do it. Wait,
[3343.88s -> 3365.27s]  how long ago was this? This is so long ago. Why was there no checkpoint here? Why was there no
[3365.27s -> 3415.10s]  checkpoint? Skill issue. I'll show you a skill issue. Hey, rate this one. All right. Let's not
[3415.10s -> 3433.29s]  mess this up, please. How did you choose Otto's name? Uh, that was Otto's name already. So Otto
[3433.29s -> 3440.01s]  was a rescue and he was already two or three years old and kind of already knew his name.
[3440.82s -> 3449.22s]  So it's just like, yeah, we'll just keep it that way. All right. Here we go.
[3462.31s -> 3469.80s]  Do it. Shoot him. I just got so angry. What the fuck? This level is so hard.
[3492.76s -> 3504.01s]  I just, you have focus, but I shot those guys like a thousand times. Oh, come on. No. What?
[3504.01s -> 3525.26s]  I, those guys weren't even, my eyes are so itchy. Okay. The whole game is difficult. It's very cheap
[3525.26s -> 3530.63s]  in the later levels. Oh, great. Well, it's a good thing we have a time limit on all of these games
[3530.63s -> 3553.75s]  we play. I wish there was a checkpoint here. Spamming is the meta. Don't be afraid to spam.
[3554.39s -> 3558.71s]  So wait, I, it's not about looking cool. It's about just spamming as much as you possibly can.
[3559.35s -> 3564.81s]  Are you going to play Elmo's preschool? No, probably not. That game's way too hard.
[3564.81s -> 3568.81s]  Especially the last boss is just like fucking stupid.
[3574.68s -> 3579.69s]  The dodge mechanic in that game is so annoying when you're in like the,
[3579.69s -> 3600.62s]  when you go to that, uh, like kind of, hold on. What the fuck? It's too hard.
[3600.62s -> 3610.10s]  It was just the underworld level is just like, I don't know. They give you like five health potions
[3610.10s -> 3614.90s]  and you can, they think you can beat that like Satan character with five, which is like, you,
[3614.90s -> 3619.54s]  it does, you, it's just, I don't know. You can only heal like a few times during that fight.
[3623.78s -> 3650.86s]  True. I don't know. It's all right. That's not bad. Don't do that anymore. Something is in my
[3650.86s -> 3680.17s]  eye and it's causing me stress. Ow. No, you piece of shit. This game is impossible. Holy shit, dude.
[3680.81s -> 3691.51s]  This game is like not even beatable. Oh, excuse me. I don't understand. I, those guys were on
[3691.51s -> 3695.59s]  the ground dead and then they, all right. I'm, I'm not, I'm doing this for real this time.
[3695.59s -> 3699.19s]  I'm not going to talk about like, oh, Elmo has a funny game with like a dodge mechanic.
[3699.91s -> 3778.76s]  Stop and play. You didn't see him blank and plain view. I want that health.
[3778.76s -> 3788.25s]  Actually, it'll read, it'll go up. Stop walking into bullets. Watch this clip. It's as, this is
[3788.25s -> 3799.43s]  as bad as singing the braids song. What braids song are you talking about? Why am I losing health?
[3799.43s -> 3816.58s]  Okay. I am going to try as hard as I can. I'm not going to talk. I'm not going to say a single
[3816.58s -> 3907.51s]  sentence. I promise. Where are the enemies? What am I doing? What's happening? What am I doing?
[3907.59s -> 3941.99s]  All right. Go. Nice. Pick up that phone. That's just kind of scared me.
[3955.30s -> 3981.40s]  Yes. Thank God. Thank goodness. Did you play Peglin? I did not. I'm still in the first level.
[3996.66s -> 3997.54s]  What is coming out of that?
[3997.78s -> 4019.45s]  From the second floor. Sorry. That's a big ice maker. You can make it. It's money. Oh, it is money.
[4024.66s -> 4027.86s]  That'd be so cool if there was a counter up in the top, right? That was like, like hundreds,
[4027.86s -> 4031.06s]  hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds.
[4031.06s -> 4088.82s]  That guy almost just killed me. There's no side jump. There is. I mean, I can side jump out of the,
[4088.82s -> 4100.30s]  out of cover. I want to like side jump right now. I hope I'm going the right way because I have
[4100.30s -> 4155.75s]  absolutely no idea where I'm going. See you. Okay. I think I got it. This game looks pretty sick.
[4156.31s -> 4164.33s]  The game is pretty sick. Can you wall run in real life? You know, I actually feel like I probably
[4164.33s -> 4168.70s]  can. You know, those things that you've never really tried that much before, but you're just
[4168.70s -> 4176.57s]  so confident that you could. I think I can. I could probably get at least one, two, three,
[4176.57s -> 4184.02s]  four, five steps or at least one, two, three, four. If I, if I was in full sprint and I was
[4184.02s -> 4198.97s]  like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. I could do at least four. Where these guys even come from?
[4198.97s -> 4210.02s]  Do it on the battle act stream. I, all right. That's fine. Well, I'm going to add more things
[4210.02s -> 4236.74s]  that I can prove that I can do. We'll get a list. I'll do them all. How did you shoot me more than
[4236.74s -> 4293.32s]  I shot you? Oh, that's how you do that. Oh goodness. What did I just do? I just did a split in the air.
[4300.14s -> 4354.87s]  That would be so scary. I have no bullets. Oh fuck. What are you doing? Oh, get out. What am I doing?
[4354.87s -> 4366.07s]  I don't know. I don't understand what to do. Am I, should I run? What? Am I missing something?
[4366.07s -> 4409.03s]  Or do I have to fight? They can definitely see me. I kicked that guy through the glass.
[4409.03s -> 4467.10s]  Dude, what the? I gotta climb this. No, I don't. It hurt me. Where do I go? You gotta eat. Dude,
[4467.10s -> 4469.58s]  they're just coming out of nowhere. They're actually spawning out of nowhere. I'm not,
[4469.58s -> 4521.74s]  I have to go somewhere. Come on, man. That's the same. Is it the same model?
[4530.50s -> 4533.06s]  Something's burnt into the bottom left of the screen and I don't know what it is.
[4536.81s -> 4555.34s]  There is text burnt into the bottom left. What is it? Is it loading screen?
[4555.34s -> 4579.38s]  I, is it select? No, it's loading. Yep. That is slowly being burnt into the screen.
[4579.38s -> 4597.16s]  How old is your capture card? Hold on. Something important just happened. What am I firing at?
[4597.96s -> 4615.93s]  It's inverted. Dude, this sucked. There's nobody to shoot. I could be inside the car right now.
[4616.65s -> 4638.92s]  There's nobody to shoot. Oh, now there is. Unreal engine demo. This is so
[4638.92s -> 4655.82s]  fucking loud. I, can anybody even hear me? Why am I doing this? Dude, you know, I have to tell you
[4655.82s -> 4660.06s]  something. It's very important and I have to pause it for this because you can't hear me.
[4660.70s -> 4666.14s]  This reminds me of arcade games that are, you know, light gun arcade games. Can somebody explain to
[4666.14s -> 4673.98s]  me please? Tell me why. Explain to me. Why is every light gun game stuck in like 2003?
[4676.14s -> 4682.86s]  Every light gun game, they've, they're on the same technology, the same kind of graphics engines.
[4682.86s -> 4692.10s]  Why are they all so kind of scuffed? Every game I've ever played at an arcade that,
[4692.10s -> 4702.02s]  it's never progressed past like 2003. No, they did not stop being made. There are new ones. There
[4702.02s -> 4707.30s]  are new ones that come out and I've played some of these new ones and they are terrible.
[4708.52s -> 4713.80s]  They are brand new games and you know what they do? This is what they do instead. Instead of
[4713.80s -> 4719.24s]  looking good and playing good, you go into this weird audio world where it's like,
[4720.76s -> 4725.64s]  we have subwoofers built in. So don't, don't, it's like, don't pay attention to the 25 FPS
[4726.28s -> 4732.15s]  awful shooting game. They, they, they make these like weird sit in Disney kind of rides
[4732.15s -> 4737.77s]  where it's just like, oh, okay, I'm ready. It just shakes and screams at you, but the game's
[4737.77s -> 4753.51s]  terrible. What happened? Why are all these games just stuck in the same era? Is it hard? Is it
[4753.51s -> 4759.11s]  just, is it impossible to make a game that's got like 2015 graphics and plays well? Why are they
[4759.11s -> 4770.38s]  all running like such shit too? Burn-in. All right, sorry. I'm so paranoid about the burn-in.
[4770.38s -> 4784.49s]  I thought the health 93% was burnt in. What if I just don't shoot anyone? I don't know if that was
[4784.49s -> 4794.89s]  scripted or not, but I would be dead. My head would have been crushed five times. I'm not
[4794.89s -> 4820.50s]  shooting anybody. This guy sucks at driving. What is happening to the car? Oh my God. Wait,
[4820.50s -> 4830.84s]  wait, I, I, wait, I'm not, no, I'm not driving. Who's driving? I would be driving better than this.
[4830.84s -> 4847.11s]  This feels like I'm playing GTA online. This is exactly what it's like. Did the bridge just spawn?
[4847.99s -> 4879.98s]  What was that? Why did the bridge just spawn? It's the matrix. Oh, it is the matrix. I'll tell you
[4879.98s -> 4885.58s]  something that has increased. You know, it has increased, not the quality of the light gun games,
[4885.58s -> 4909.02s]  but how much they cost to play. Interesting. Exit. Tell me it's close. It's close. The fire escape
[4909.02s -> 4914.54s]  on your left. Hurry. Does it make this phone on the roof? The phone is behind the roof access door.
[4914.78s -> 4917.34s]  Oh, thanks sparks. I couldn't have been on the ground floor.
[4924.73s -> 4946.39s]  She aimed that gun like she was casting a spell. Oh, here he is. Yeah. No pinball tables. It's
[4946.39s -> 4950.23s]  bullshit. You know what? There are a lot of places that are starting to kind of try to do the old
[4950.23s -> 4963.02s]  fashion arcade stuff. That's really cool. If I ever had an arcade, it would just be free pizza,
[4963.02s -> 4980.06s]  but you had to be like playing. That's a casino. Nevermind. Free pizza. It's just like a waiter or
[4980.06s -> 4985.02s]  a waitress rocking around. Pizza. Anybody want some pizza? Oh yeah. I'll take a slice instead
[4985.02s -> 4997.48s]  of alcohol. I'm sorry, but that's fucking cool. That's, I would go there, but then the logistically
[4997.48s -> 5002.34s]  would be hard because people get greasy fingers all over the controls. Imagine somebody walking
[5002.34s -> 5006.74s]  around with like a piping hot pizza, walking around the like, I almost just said casino floor.
[5007.54s -> 5033.53s]  Imagine walking on the casino floor. Where's that? I just, I didn't know what like the constraints
[5033.53s -> 5044.92s]  were of the video game. I actually didn't mean to do that one. Greasy controllers are given at an
[5044.92s -> 5054.28s]  arcade. They always have bar food. You know what? What's going on here? You come to my arcade. Okay.
[5054.84s -> 5061.26s]  As long as you're playing, you know you're playing. Hey, I'm having one like slice. How are you doing
[5061.26s -> 5067.58s]  over there? By the way, no toppings or no bullshit. No toppings. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse
[5067.58s -> 5078.98s]  me. Oh yeah. Pepperoni and olives. No, no, no, no. This is cheese only by the way. What do you mean
[5078.98s -> 5087.13s]  fuck that? No toppings. You know how difficult it would be to actually logistically put that
[5087.13s -> 5096.14s]  together? Hold on a second. Oh, I had an opportunity. I just need to, I'm sorry everyone. I need to do
[5096.14s -> 5110.17s]  this. This is for the video. This is for the video and three, two, one. This is for the video.
[5112.36s -> 5132.28s]  Let's go. It is I, Superman. It's going to be, I can see it. People can rewind and watch it rewind.
[5132.28s -> 5144.84s]  It's going to have a huge hump for replayed part of the video. Ladders. How do these work?
[5160.18s -> 5166.23s]  That place would be disgusting. They would just be, people would drop full cheese slices,
[5166.23s -> 5170.74s]  cheese side down on the ground. You know what I'm talking about? Just like, oh, thank you.
[5170.74s -> 5177.82s]  They appreciate a full slice. Cheese like sauce, cheese side down on the ground.
[5177.82s -> 5188.46s]  This place would be a mess. You got bread side down. That's not a big deal. Cheese side down.
[5188.46s -> 5215.94s]  That's a carpet clean. Oh, yes. Cheese. I'm talking like with this, like cheese and sauce
[5215.94s -> 5230.38s]  side down. Like if you dropped it on the ground, new tip impossibly fast, incredibly lethal
[5230.38s -> 5235.10s]  and fearless are hands down the deadliest enemies within the matrix. You can never completely kill
[5235.10s -> 5239.32s]  an agent. They'll just acquire another body that is plugged into the matrix. At best,
[5239.32s -> 5252.65s]  you can temporarily defeat. All right. So it's like, you just can't kill them. I don't even
[5252.65s -> 5263.02s]  know where, where am I going? Yeah. And you could not order a full pizza. It would just be a slice
[5263.02s -> 5272.86s]  of cheese is what you could get. Am I missing something here? I'm, that probably looked on
[5272.86s -> 5276.86s]  purpose and it kind of was, but I thought I could go, I don't know. I thought I could do Spider-Man
[5276.86s -> 5281.34s]  on the wall. People are going to be pissed. I'm sorry. People are going to be pissed off now,
[5281.34s -> 5286.49s]  but that's going to make people angry. It's like, dude, just stop doing this. Not fucking funny.
[5286.49s -> 5302.84s]  I'm just trying to see what I can do in the game. What are you doing? So I need to go. Oh,
[5302.84s -> 5354.79s]  there's a ladder right here. So now from, where do I go from here? This way over there. Climb
[5354.79s -> 5392.90s]  over the fence. You can jump a thousand feet in the air. Oh, oh shit. What were you, why were you
[5392.90s -> 5408.17s]  two in here? What is in here? Why are they were just sitting in here? There's nothing here. What
[5408.25s -> 5458.44s]  is that? Just a big, is that just like a, what is it? What is it? Oh, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Anderson.
[5458.44s -> 5470.57s]  Okay. So just don't, just don't bite them. Oh my God. Okay. This actually sucks. I just gotta run.
[5470.57s -> 5491.06s]  This sucks. It's so far back. Mr. Anderson, seven minutes. How many people in the chat even
[5491.06s -> 5508.87s]  understand what that was? Some of you do. Some of you, not very many. That is Albert Wesker,
[5508.87s -> 5529.93s]  but why did I say that? Trivia, some channel trivia for people. Stop. Old video, dude. That's
[5529.93s -> 5556.38s]  right. No. Oh my fucking God. You've got to be, I, oh my God. I got caught on the lip and I didn't
[5556.38s -> 5573.46s]  jump. I got stuck and the character went like that and I couldn't stop doing that. I'm sorry.
[5574.46s -> 5581.34s]  I'm not doing it on purpose. I am telling you, I'm promising you. I actually got, you think I
[5581.34s -> 5586.15s]  would be at the very end like that and do that? No, I got caught. You should change the game. I'm
[5586.15s -> 5592.14s]  kind of, I kind of like this. I'm giving this another 30, 20, 30 minutes. I, I get to, I'm going
[5592.14s -> 5598.74s]  to have the streamer reverse veto where I'm, I'm playing this like at least another 25 minutes,
[5598.74s -> 5637.02s]  at least this is, I like this a lot. This is very fun. Okay. Come on. Don't screw it up. Okay. Now
[5637.02s -> 5665.14s]  I have to sit here. The health region. Okay. What is this? A little shortcut. What is this? I didn't
[5665.14s -> 5679.21s]  see this. What do I go? Where do I go? I fucking freaked out. I freaked out. I'm going to take the
[5679.21s -> 5686.57s]  disc out. I, I thought I had to jump over there. I don't, I don't, I can't fight them. Oh shit. I
[5686.57s -> 5698.84s]  look so stupid. I look so dumb. I would, I, where do you go? It doesn't look like there's a, to the
[5698.84s -> 5710.55s]  right. Don't jump to him. What? Where am I supposed to go? I need to go left. I, that's what I tried
[5710.55s -> 5726.63s]  to do. You were at the right spot. I just missed the jump. This breakable wood. I, that, that's
[5726.63s -> 5740.73s]  what I saw. And I was like, can I jump into that or through that? I almost didn't make that jump.
[5781.56s -> 5849.85s]  What? Stop. Oh shit. Is that him? Now where? Here. Oh, I pressed it and it didn't jump,
[5849.85s -> 5884.23s]  but I made it. I'm fine. Oh, we got a cut scene. Perfect. Okay. You want a shot to feel good,
[5884.23s -> 5893.16s]  can fix you up. Right now, all I know is what's on that disc. Sir, we just received an emergency
[5893.16s -> 5898.44s]  broadcast from the Logos. She did it. Yes, sir. The last transmission of the Osiris.
[5899.00s -> 5904.36s]  This is Daddy's, captain of the Osiris. It is 1803 on 1214 and I fear this will be our last
[5904.36s -> 5910.04s]  transmission. Less than two hours ago, we were pinned between two search units near BZ 218.
[5910.04s -> 5913.64s]  We tried to outrun them on the surface when our sensors went completely berserk.
[5913.72s -> 5918.04s]  We didn't believe what our equipment was telling us until we ran smack into the middle of it.
[5918.68s -> 5925.16s]  An army, their army. It's massive. Hundreds of times the size of anything we fought.
[5925.80s -> 5929.72s]  We're under heavy pursuit and have sustained critical damage. We're going to attempt an
[5929.72s -> 5936.76s]  emergency broadcast drop in the matrix. After that, let's hope that somehow this disc reaches Zion.
[5936.76s -> 5940.20s]  And if it does, it's not too late. We had an opportunity.
[5942.65s -> 5947.85s]  Drop down in Zion broadcast. I want this data transmitted immediately. Emergency encryption.
[5948.57s -> 5953.13s]  What are you saying? Wife of Barty? Lieutenant. Yes, sir. Is the Logos still in contact?
[5953.13s -> 5956.97s]  Yes, sir. There's ants in your hair. Get me Captain Nyope.
[5956.97s -> 5964.09s]  Black feed from Zion. Jesus, it's deadbolt himself. Give me that.
[5967.06s -> 5970.90s]  Captain, you and your crew to be commended. What you have done may prove to be the turning
[5970.90s -> 5975.78s]  point in this war. Do you have a plan, Commander? Right now, I want every ship to return to Zion
[5975.78s -> 5980.86s]  all as fast as humanly possible. I leave the recall hands kept.
[5980.86s -> 5984.54s]  Yes, sir, Commander. It's all on one disc, by the way. That's pretty remarkable.
[5984.54s -> 5990.09s]  Nyope, please be careful. As careful as I can be.
[5995.72s -> 5998.68s]  That's just one disc. It was a DVD. The power of the DVD.
[6000.25s -> 6004.38s]  No, it's weird about the Xbox. When that first came out,
[6006.94s -> 6010.78s]  that's why we're going to use the airport. All those different pay phones will make a trace
[6010.78s -> 6014.54s]  impossible. We can split up and stay mobile. What could go wrong?
[6014.54s -> 6044.25s]  I am calling to confirm that your order of Red Orchids will be delivered tomorrow by midnight.
[6045.05s -> 6050.30s]  This is the Great Beyond Travel Agency. We will get back to you as soon as humanly possible.
[6051.02s -> 6055.34s]  I am calling to confirm that your order of Red Orchids will be delivered tomorrow by midnight.
[6056.38s -> 6058.38s]  Operator. Jax.
[6058.38s -> 6061.18s]  Nyope, is that you? I'm not sure I can talk right now, Jax.
[6061.18s -> 6066.06s]  Nyope, listen to me. They got Axel. Soren led everybody in after him. It's bad,
[6067.02s -> 6068.46s]  Where? The airport.
[6068.46s -> 6070.30s]  What? We're at the airport.
[6070.30s -> 6071.90s]  Please, you gotta help us.
[6071.90s -> 6075.98s]  Agents have cornered Soren. They're moving Axel to the tarmac. If they get him in the air...
[6079.85s -> 6082.81s]  What the hell happened? I thought you said be discreet.
[6082.81s -> 6084.97s]  It wasn't me. It's Soren.
[6084.97s -> 6088.25s]  Agents pinched one of his crew. Now they've come in and tried to rescue him.
[6088.25s -> 6089.21s]  You? Yeah.
[6089.21s -> 6091.13s]  What? Lucky for him, not so lucky for us.
[6091.85s -> 6092.65s]  It's Axel.
[6092.65s -> 6093.69s]  Shit. What do you want to do?
[6093.69s -> 6096.17s]  See if you can help Soren. I'll go after Axel.
[6096.17s -> 6097.05s]  Well, good luck.
[6097.05s -> 6098.65s]  I'm certainly due for something.
[6098.65s -> 6113.72s]  I have no idea what just happened. Okay.
[6114.36s -> 6118.70s]  Okay, stay calm. Help is on its way.
[6118.70s -> 6121.34s]  How many of them were there? I swear I got them.
[6121.34s -> 6122.54s]  Did you see any of them?
[6122.54s -> 6123.82s]  He was right in my sights.
[6125.10s -> 6126.62s]  Why did I... No, put this down.
[6126.62s -> 6127.66s]  Emergency evacuation.
[6127.66s -> 6128.70s]  Can I... How can I...
[6128.70s -> 6132.06s]  They're just gonna lie down and get scanned by the machine.
[6138.94s -> 6140.38s]  I didn't even go through security.
[6142.22s -> 6144.78s]  What? What... I don't...
[6145.82s -> 6148.31s]  Oh, shit. It's Agent Smith.
[6148.31s -> 6156.36s]  Shit. What's going on?
[6158.54s -> 6159.82s]  What? I just made it through.
[6165.58s -> 6166.78s]  This isn't Hitman.
[6166.78s -> 6168.22s]  You unlocked the cartwheel.
[6168.22s -> 6169.50s]  This guy does not know where I am.
[6170.38s -> 6184.01s]  What'd he just drop?
[6184.01s -> 6185.21s]  Ooh, how do I use that?
[6185.21s -> 6186.89s]  Wait, how do I use the cartwheel?
[6186.89s -> 6196.58s]  I'm holding gun, hold down, focus, side step.
[6196.58s -> 6198.74s]  Okay, so you have to have a gun out.
[6198.74s -> 6206.20s]  How does this not work?
[6206.20s -> 6234.92s]  Okay, I think I missed something here.
[6235.99s -> 6238.55s]  This dude's flailing. I was told flailing is fine.
[6239.88s -> 6240.84s]  All right, I'm back.
[6241.40s -> 6252.66s]  Why did that guy climb?
[6253.46s -> 6254.74s]  He climbed on top.
[6255.46s -> 6261.38s]  Okay, what do I do?
[6262.10s -> 6282.34s]  Is this supposed to be a stealth mission?
[6282.34s -> 6282.74s]  Well, I...
[6283.93s -> 6286.25s]  Like, the character picked up the weapon.
[6286.25s -> 6286.73s]  I didn't want...
[6286.73s -> 6288.01s]  No, look, I don't want this stuff.
[6288.01s -> 6288.73s]  I didn't want to do that.
[6290.01s -> 6306.39s]  How do I use flashbangs?
[6309.96s -> 6310.76s]  Circle strafe.
[6311.40s -> 6317.66s]  Use your strafe controls.
[6317.66s -> 6318.94s]  Well, how do I strafe?
[6318.94s -> 6322.76s]  Oh, hit strafe left and strafe right.
[6322.76s -> 6325.75s]  That doesn't help at all.
[6325.75s -> 6326.79s]  Hold target lock.
[6326.79s -> 6335.48s]  Wait a minute, what's strafe?
[6336.12s -> 6348.06s]  Press strafe to strafe.
[6349.90s -> 6358.92s]  This is not a cartwheel.
[6358.92s -> 6360.12s]  I'm sorry, but it's not.
[6360.76s -> 6365.93s]  I'm not dying in here.
[6367.05s -> 6404.02s]  Fucking get down, what?
[6404.58s -> 6426.15s]  I can't adapt how you do it.
[6426.15s -> 6430.87s]  I'm gonna die.
[6430.87s -> 6431.83s]  Please don't do it.
[6433.03s -> 6440.74s]  Where am I supposed to go?
[6441.70s -> 6445.38s]  This is gonna keep spawning on me
[6445.38s -> 6448.18s]  until I find the right door to plug into or whatever.
[6455.21s -> 6457.85s]  NVIDIA, the way it's meant to be played.
[6457.85s -> 6458.49s]  Holy shit.
[6459.21s -> 6461.45s]  It's linear, just go forward.
[6461.45s -> 6462.57s]  Isn't that where I just was?
[6463.37s -> 6468.28s]  Oh, I was not here.
[6468.28s -> 6469.40s]  Oh, all right, all right, all right.
[6498.55s -> 6500.71s]  That guy, the only one that got affected by it.
[6501.99s -> 6503.19s]  He looked over here.
[6506.65s -> 6508.17s]  Oh my God, I just want to...
[6511.62s -> 6535.50s]  Fuck.
[6535.50s -> 6537.58s]  They can see pretty well right now.
[6538.30s -> 6548.07s]  This is where you go.
[6548.07s -> 6548.71s]  Everything's fine.
[6548.71s -> 6549.67s]  Oh, this is awk.
[6549.67s -> 6550.31s]  Everything's fine.
[6550.31s -> 6575.08s]  You need to throw a grenade at the window.
[6575.72s -> 6580.81s]  No, I don't.
[6581.37s -> 6586.38s]  He didn't read.
[6588.49s -> 6589.29s]  Use the grenade.
[6590.46s -> 6591.58s]  An actual grenade.
[6593.78s -> 6594.98s]  I don't even have grenades.
[6596.20s -> 6597.24s]  Is there a different grenade button?
[6597.80s -> 6599.02s]  That's a flashbang.
[6599.02s -> 6601.42s]  Okay, but I don't have actual grenades.
[6606.28s -> 6608.44s]  Weapons like fire, secondary fire.
[6608.44s -> 6609.96s]  First person, kick, jump.
[6609.96s -> 6613.06s]  Do I... I don't have any grenades.
[6614.26s -> 6616.12s]  Shoot the glass.
[6616.12s -> 6621.77s]  I don't think there is.
[6621.77s -> 6632.52s]  No, I don't think there is.
[6632.52s -> 6638.47s]  Do you think it was trapped?
[6638.47s -> 6639.35s]  Try the big wall.
[6640.15s -> 6643.37s]  Hold on, let me just make sure.
[6643.37s -> 6647.50s]  No, I didn't miss something over here.
[6648.30s -> 6656.92s]  I don't get it.
[6657.72s -> 6670.41s]  I think you need to use the superman dive.
[6682.68s -> 6689.42s]  Okay, where does it want me to go?
[6690.94s -> 6692.22s]  I think I might actually be soft-locked.
[6701.27s -> 6702.23s]  It's the white button.
[6702.23s -> 6707.91s]  Yeah, the yellow...
[6708.87s -> 6709.75s]  Is something yellow in the room?
[6710.47s -> 6711.56s]  The yellow box?
[6711.56s -> 6712.60s]  Yeah, I can't touch it.
[6713.16s -> 6717.24s]  In the lockers?
[6717.88s -> 6723.54s]  This actually might be bugged.
[6723.54s -> 6732.38s]  The flashbangs might have soft-locked the box.
[6732.38s -> 6734.06s]  That's the grenade box.
[6734.06s -> 6736.52s]  Oh, should I just refresh?
[6739.54s -> 6740.34s]  I'll just refresh.
[6740.82s -> 6742.60s]  How far away is the load, though?
[6743.24s -> 6743.88s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[6743.88s -> 6744.44s]  Just shoot it.
[6746.12s -> 6746.68s]  Wall?
[6746.68s -> 6747.00s]  Run?
[6747.64s -> 6768.57s]  Follow the arrow.
[6768.57s -> 6769.37s]  I can't.
[6769.37s -> 6773.83s]  You could probably blow your way out of there.
[6775.80s -> 6776.04s]  Yeah?
[6777.00s -> 6780.50s]  It's broken.
[6780.50s -> 6781.22s]  I'm just going to relax.
[6781.94s -> 6784.55s]  It's...
[6784.55s -> 6785.51s]  Okay, everything's fucked up.
[6785.51s -> 6786.55s]  I'm just going to...
[6786.55s -> 6789.42s]  I'm scared that if I do this, though...
[6790.30s -> 6799.35s]  Where am I going to be?
[6799.35s -> 6804.12s]  Shoot the box?
[6804.12s -> 6805.40s]  It's not shoot the box.
[6815.53s -> 6816.25s]  It's not...
[6816.25s -> 6818.89s]  I guarantee it's not shoot the box.
[6818.89s -> 6823.46s]  I guarantee it.
[6823.46s -> 6825.54s]  This is not that far back.
[6827.22s -> 6828.18s]  That's one of them.
[6828.18s -> 6828.90s]  Get to the guns.
[6830.01s -> 6830.33s]  See?
[6830.33s -> 6831.21s]  Okay, I just picked it up.
[6861.69s -> 6863.29s]  All right, so now...
[6864.65s -> 6865.29s]  Flashbang.
[6867.45s -> 6873.11s]  Why is it back?
[6886.71s -> 6887.83s]  You broke it again?
[6891.26s -> 6892.22s]  How did I do that?
[6906.52s -> 6907.32s]  You weren't soft-locked.
[6907.32s -> 6908.20s]  You didn't break it.
[6913.26s -> 6915.26s]  Change to different...
[6915.26s -> 6915.66s]  Hold on.
[6916.38s -> 6919.00s]  What was that?
[6920.07s -> 6921.03s]  Oh, I thought I shot...
[6921.03s -> 6923.11s]  I thought I shot a harpoon out of my chest.
[6923.91s -> 6924.63s]  All right, hold on.
[6925.69s -> 6926.81s]  Do I have to do it again?
[6926.81s -> 6928.25s]  Equip the grenade.
[6928.25s -> 6935.66s]  I didn't know where to...
[6935.66s -> 6936.14s]  Okay.
[6936.14s -> 6937.42s]  It didn't tell me to do that ever.
[6938.06s -> 6947.99s]  Let's go.
[6947.99s -> 6966.38s]  Okay, now where do I go?
[6968.76s -> 6969.48s]  Oh, dude!
[6969.48s -> 6971.80s]  Maximize your experience with Pentium IV.
[6973.10s -> 6973.58s]  That...
[6973.58s -> 6974.70s]  A lot of computer ads.
[6975.34s -> 6996.31s]  What?
[6996.31s -> 7008.01s]  Stop!
[7008.65s -> 7013.99s]  Am I right?
[7027.46s -> 7028.90s]  Why did he go so fast?
[7041.08s -> 7048.97s]  I thought the helicopter was inside of the building for a second.
[7049.13s -> 7051.45s]  Like, this is no way.
[7052.01s -> 7077.10s]  Why are you saying F?
[7077.10s -> 7077.42s]  F?
[7077.42s -> 7077.90s]  What?
[7077.90s -> 7078.70s]  Small F?
[7078.70s -> 7085.77s]  I don't see it on my end.
[7085.77s -> 7091.77s]  The only option is to fight.
[7091.77s -> 7104.60s]  I didn't even have a second to understand what was going on.
[7104.60s -> 7105.72s]  Maybe the switch is having a problem?
[7106.76s -> 7107.64s]  Okay, so don't...
[7127.02s -> 7127.58s]  Fuck you!
[7170.95s -> 7178.26s]  Refresh my health!
[7178.26s -> 7193.91s]  Why is the health not counting up?
[7193.91s -> 7194.63s]  I can't.
[7195.67s -> 7197.99s]  Fourth wall break when he looked over his shoulder like,
[7197.99s -> 7203.74s]  Whoa, man, this is crazy.
[7203.74s -> 7205.18s]  The music is fucking me up, too.
[7205.18s -> 7205.66s]  It's just like...
[7209.34s -> 7210.62s]  The disk is to get things.
[7212.22s -> 7213.58s]  How do you do this without...
[7214.46s -> 7250.65s]  Where's the helicopter?
[7251.37s -> 7263.08s]  Hell are you talking about?
[7263.08s -> 7264.44s]  Oh my god!
[7283.22s -> 7284.26s]  I'm so dead!
[7287.18s -> 7288.86s]  Oh my goodness.
[7292.87s -> 7293.27s]  This is...
[7294.01s -> 7295.05s]  This is ridiculous.
[7303.06s -> 7304.98s]  What's the way to actually go about doing this?
[7304.98s -> 7308.18s]  Just use grenades on the helicopter?
[7308.18s -> 7309.22s]  I don't think that's gonna work.
[7383.08s -> 7384.20s]  Why would you do that?
[7393.58s -> 7396.92s]  Well, the helicopter's cycle is so weird.
[7396.92s -> 7397.80s]  Like, where is it?
[7400.23s -> 7407.83s]  I give up.
[7407.83s -> 7408.71s]  What are you supposed to do about this?
[7413.88s -> 7414.76s]  Dodge the bullets?
[7415.72s -> 7416.60s]  Okay.
[7416.60s -> 7418.62s]  Excuse me.
[7418.62s -> 7420.06s]  Just dodge the bullets.
[7422.15s -> 7423.11s]  That ain't gonna happen.
[7424.15s -> 7462.62s]  Where's the helicopter?
[7468.63s -> 7469.19s]  It goes around.
[7469.19s -> 7469.43s]  It goes...
[7474.10s -> 7484.38s]  So then wait for it to turn around and knock up.
[7484.38s -> 7484.94s]  God damn it!
[7484.94s -> 7485.74s]  I thought they were spawning.
[7486.38s -> 7506.76s]  That was a good cycle.
[7506.76s -> 7508.28s]  Wait for the machine gun fire.
[7508.28s -> 7508.92s]  Go across.
[7514.81s -> 7515.21s]  Yep.
[7515.21s -> 7517.11s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[7517.11s -> 7517.35s]  Go.
[7518.07s -> 7526.04s]  Maybe one more cycle.
[7531.69s -> 7532.89s]  Get off my screen!
[7565.48s -> 7565.88s]  Yeah!
[7566.84s -> 7592.33s]  What does it want me to do?
[7592.89s -> 7602.31s]  Check the area for useful gear.
[7602.31s -> 7602.95s]  What does it want me to...
[7602.95s -> 7665.88s]  I don't get it.
[7665.88s -> 7666.84s]  I have to get it.
[7666.84s -> 7667.88s]  I can't leave without it.
[7670.22s -> 7681.80s]  Is there a crouch?
[7705.66s -> 7712.10s]  I don't know what it wants me to do.
[7712.82s -> 7718.82s]  Hey, did you ever heard of up dog?
[7720.14s -> 7722.22s]  What is that thing you just said up dog?
[7722.22s -> 7745.61s]  I don't know why it wants me to do this.
[7746.17s -> 7746.33s]  Good.
[7746.33s -> 7747.77s]  I think it was just broken.
[7748.66s -> 7751.46s]  I'm having a good time, but it might be time to move on to...
[7754.38s -> 7754.86s]  I don't know.
[7754.86s -> 7756.46s]  Moving on sounds like a bad idea.
[7757.50s -> 7757.90s]  Hold on.
[7761.22s -> 7761.62s]  Not yet.
[7762.18s -> 7762.50s]  Another...
[7763.22s -> 7764.42s]  I can't get past that gate.
[7767.02s -> 7767.82s]  The other walkway.
[7768.38s -> 7786.38s]  I don't know where I'm going.
[7786.38s -> 7824.70s]  How'd you guys get over here?
[7825.34s -> 7827.27s]  This wasn't open!
[7828.55s -> 7830.63s]  That was not just open 15 seconds ago.
[7831.43s -> 7867.56s]  I was gonna say I almost like fogged too hard there.
[7867.56s -> 7868.60s]  And went out the window.
[7869.56s -> 7889.64s]  Lower the resolution to the face cam.
[7889.64s -> 7890.76s]  No, it'll break.
[7892.78s -> 7893.98s]  I have it set perfectly right now.
[7893.98s -> 7894.94s]  I don't want to fix it again.
[7900.49s -> 7902.60s]  The piano will help you reach the roof.
[7903.24s -> 7909.45s]  Is it piano?
[7939.91s -> 7945.54s]  I love this music.
[7946.34s -> 7949.54s]  Butter!
[7958.30s -> 7959.10s]  I almost made it.
[7959.74s -> 7986.84s]  Grab it!
[8010.94s -> 8012.38s]  Wait on the piano.
[8012.38s -> 8023.16s]  Piano?
[8028.18s -> 8029.22s]  Aim, you idiot.
[8029.94s -> 8033.19s]  Where's the piano?
[8061.88s -> 8063.32s]  I have to pee so bad.
[8063.32s -> 8070.44s]  Why is he looking for a piano in the ceiling?
[8070.44s -> 8070.84s]  I'm not.
[8070.92s -> 8071.08s]  I'm...
[8075.24s -> 8076.20s]  Where's this piano?
[8076.84s -> 8077.88s]  Wait for the piano.
[8092.36s -> 8093.48s]  Where's the piano?
[8094.28s -> 8095.00s]  I'm being loud.
[8107.30s -> 8107.70s]  Okay.
[8107.70s -> 8108.42s]  I don't...
[8108.42s -> 8117.83s]  I don't know what was...
[8117.83s -> 8119.19s]  Guys, this is a...
[8119.19s -> 8119.43s]  It's a...
[8120.23s -> 8125.88s]  I'll go pee.
[8126.44s -> 8128.92s]  We lost some time in there.
[8128.92s -> 8129.56s]  Where are they now?
[8129.56s -> 8130.84s]  Soren and his men have been cornered.
[8130.84s -> 8131.24s]  Give me a minute.
[8131.24s -> 8132.52s]  AT-28 in the annex.
[8132.52s -> 8133.56s]  How's Naomi doing?
[8133.56s -> 8134.52s]  She's not dead yet.
[8136.79s -> 8137.27s]  Okay.
[8137.27s -> 8138.07s]  I gotta pee a beer back.
[8138.79s -> 8318.33s]  Got about the burn in.
[8318.33s -> 8321.80s]  But something else that's very interesting.
[8321.80s -> 8323.16s]  So I had this computer.
[8323.16s -> 8325.56s]  This room gets really, really hot.
[8325.56s -> 8328.42s]  Because this computer and, you know,
[8328.42s -> 8331.45s]  streaming and encoding and things
[8331.45s -> 8332.57s]  pretty much just cooking over here.
[8335.13s -> 8338.46s]  The original Xbox is almost, I think,
[8338.46s -> 8341.80s]  generating more heat than that computer.
[8341.80s -> 8345.16s]  I went from just out of this room to back in here
[8345.16s -> 8348.68s]  and it was at least 10% to 20% hotter in here
[8348.68s -> 8351.53s]  than it's ever been.
[8351.53s -> 8353.53s]  It's like a sauna in this room.
[8354.09s -> 8356.76s]  This is ridiculous.
[8364.86s -> 8365.74s]  You should play Halo.
[8366.81s -> 8367.21s]  I actually...
[8367.21s -> 8367.77s]  I thought about it.
[8368.41s -> 8369.21s]  Maybe one of these days.
[8370.74s -> 8371.06s]  All right.
[8371.06s -> 8372.58s]  So I'm not leaving yet.
[8373.22s -> 8376.65s]  But I do want to give you a couple of options here.
[8376.65s -> 8381.48s]  It's not over yet.
[8381.48s -> 8384.63s]  But I want to pull in the chat.
[8384.63s -> 8387.96s]  I'm going to give you three options to pivot from here.
[8387.96s -> 8392.87s]  The first option is Cold Fear.
[8392.87s -> 8400.25s]  The second option is Star Wars Obi-Wan.
[8404.06s -> 8407.18s]  And the third option is Legends of Wrestling.
[8410.34s -> 8411.93s]  That's a tough one.
[8411.93s -> 8413.53s]  That's a very tough one.
[8413.53s -> 8420.42s]  Is there a fourth option?
[8420.42s -> 8421.46s]  Go offline.
[8421.46s -> 8425.43s]  It's a little too early for that.
[8428.30s -> 8428.94s]  Okay.
[8428.94s -> 8429.42s]  Coming back.
[8434.76s -> 8435.16s]  Let's see.
[8435.16s -> 8435.88s]  What do you guys want?
[8438.78s -> 8440.38s]  It's still pretty early in the poll.
[8440.38s -> 8446.98s]  Are you ever going to return to A Dead of Night?
[8446.98s -> 8447.46s]  No.
[8447.46s -> 8447.78s]  Never.
[8449.03s -> 8449.43s]  Never.
[8449.43s -> 8452.20s]  That's just not going to happen.
[8452.20s -> 8461.53s]  I couldn't do it.
[8462.33s -> 8462.73s]  All right.
[8463.37s -> 8467.78s]  Unless the Obi-Wan fans can really pull this through,
[8467.78s -> 8470.18s]  Legends of Wrestling looks like it's going to be what we're doing.
[8470.18s -> 8473.64s]  It's really not even close.
[8474.20s -> 8475.00s]  Go ahead and close it.
[8475.72s -> 8477.56s]  Legends of Wrestling is up next.
[8477.56s -> 8480.76s]  Okay.
[8480.76s -> 8481.64s]  Let's go.
[8481.64s -> 8486.76s]  I'll play this for another 15 minutes.
[8486.76s -> 8498.71s]  That was the lamest action movie jump I've ever seen.
[8509.67s -> 8510.71s]  So loud.
[8510.71s -> 8513.58s]  Is it?
[8513.58s -> 8517.35s]  Oh, I didn't turn up the music.
[8517.99s -> 8522.12s]  All right.
[8522.12s -> 8524.52s]  Does anybody else get like this when there's an escalator
[8525.70s -> 8527.06s]  and there's nobody in front of you?
[8527.62s -> 8529.53s]  Just go.
[8529.53s -> 8530.09s]  Hurry up.
[8530.09s -> 8530.33s]  Right?
[8535.58s -> 8537.34s]  Sometimes I just sit there though.
[8537.34s -> 8541.10s]  Sometimes I just like, you know what?
[8541.10s -> 8541.58s]  I don't even care.
[8541.58s -> 8543.42s]  I'm going to let the machine just do it for me.
[8544.06s -> 8552.20s]  Are you not afraid of escalators?
[8555.02s -> 8557.38s]  Because to me in my brain,
[8557.38s -> 8560.02s]  an escalator is an incredibly basic contraption.
[8561.54s -> 8563.78s]  All an escalator is, is just a thing.
[8563.78s -> 8565.78s]  It's just a tread that moves in a circle.
[8566.68s -> 8569.56s]  There's nothing really that mechanically ridiculous
[8569.56s -> 8572.28s]  or strange about an escalator.
[8572.84s -> 8574.36s]  It's a very basic concept.
[8576.54s -> 8579.18s]  It's the stuff that has the complicated shit in the middle
[8579.18s -> 8579.98s]  that freaks me out.
[8582.92s -> 8596.95s]  By the way, where am I going here?
[8596.95s -> 8597.27s]  Shoot.
[8598.92s -> 8601.08s]  What did I just, did I just command bullets to fly?
[8601.88s -> 8607.02s]  It's still open.
[8607.02s -> 8607.66s]  Now's your chance.
[8611.94s -> 8612.34s]  Oh, move.
[8612.90s -> 8613.70s]  Check your gun.
[8613.70s -> 8621.26s]  Give the signal.
[8621.26s -> 8621.98s]  So open it.
[8625.10s -> 8625.58s]  Oops.
[8630.90s -> 8632.10s]  For a second I thought he was talking.
[8632.10s -> 8633.30s]  I thought that was the person in my ear.
[8635.37s -> 8636.57s]  Escalator up at the second floor.
[8643.86s -> 8644.42s]  Technology.
[8644.98s -> 8655.48s]  How do you miss every single one of those?
[8676.18s -> 8676.98s]  No, my goodness.
[8676.98s -> 8677.78s]  I'm going to die.
[8677.78s -> 8683.11s]  Not if I hide over here.
[8683.11s -> 8710.76s]  Oh, escalator.
[8710.76s -> 8711.32s]  What?
[8711.32s -> 8731.14s]  Why can I not take the escalator?
[8731.14s -> 8732.02s]  Take the stairs?
[8732.02s -> 8735.99s]  It said take the escalator, didn't it?
[8735.99s -> 8739.91s]  Something I have to do with it?
[8739.91s -> 8740.55s]  They're different.
[8740.55s -> 8740.79s]  No.
[8752.82s -> 8754.26s]  Anyone want to help me?
[8754.26s -> 8754.98s]  The different one?
[8755.62s -> 8762.46s]  The game is chugging so hard right now.
[8762.70s -> 8764.47s]  Okay.
[8764.47s -> 8767.19s]  It's a different escalator.
[8767.19s -> 8788.36s]  Oh, all right.
[8788.36s -> 8789.24s]  There we, whoa.
[8789.96s -> 8799.94s]  Where did it go?
[8799.94s -> 8800.18s]  What?
[8800.18s -> 8801.86s]  It went into the escalator.
[8801.86s -> 8812.60s]  There's a door leading there at the end of this hall.
[8812.60s -> 8813.00s]  Right here.
[8852.46s -> 8853.10s]  Over the railing.
[8853.10s -> 8853.74s]  Over the railing.
[8853.74s -> 8854.38s]  Over the railing.
[8854.38s -> 8854.94s]  Come on.
[8854.94s -> 8856.46s]  Oh, and I didn't even do it in slow motion.
[8856.46s -> 8857.18s]  I'm pissed.
[8857.18s -> 8879.05s]  Don't die here.
[8879.05s -> 8879.53s]  Hold on.
[8879.53s -> 8887.03s]  Hide next with a bunch of exclamation points.
[8887.03s -> 8887.83s]  Relax.
[8887.83s -> 8894.90s]  Okay.
[8894.90s -> 8896.79s]  He came, he's behind me.
[8896.79s -> 8897.11s]  Where?
[8898.49s -> 8905.40s]  What?
[8905.40s -> 8907.16s]  That was a cardboard cutout.
[8907.16s -> 8912.18s]  Exactly five to 10 minutes from now.
[8912.18s -> 8914.34s]  We're going to do Legends of Rest.
[8914.58s -> 8926.07s]  They get Axl off the ground.
[8926.07s -> 8926.55s]  He's dead.
[8932.87s -> 8933.35s]  Who's this?
[8940.38s -> 8941.18s]  Find them.
[8941.18s -> 8944.79s]  Can't give him a car.
[8945.43s -> 8946.98s]  Binary.
[8946.98s -> 8948.18s]  Or like a golf cart.
[8948.18s -> 8950.71s]  We'll take you to such a double back.
[8950.71s -> 8951.43s]  Ghost, can you cover us?
[8951.43s -> 8952.55s]  Do they have to run?
[8952.55s -> 8957.61s]  I got it.
[8957.61s -> 8959.13s]  What is your field of fire?
[8959.69s -> 8960.81s]  I've got the runway.
[8960.81s -> 8962.17s]  How about the hangar?
[8962.17s -> 8963.21s]  Provide sniper cover.
[8963.21s -> 8963.85s]  I can cover that too.
[8963.85s -> 8964.97s]  I've got activity below.
[8964.97s -> 8965.69s]  Top of the stairs.
[8965.69s -> 8966.57s]  One of the suspects.
[8966.57s -> 8967.45s]  The female.
[8967.45s -> 8969.85s]  Clear shot.
[8969.85s -> 8970.57s]  Confirmed.
[8970.57s -> 8973.78s]  Take them.
[8973.78s -> 8975.38s]  That was so, like such a,
[8975.38s -> 8978.73s]  I thought we were on the same team.
[8978.73s -> 8980.25s]  That was so overdone too.
[8980.25s -> 8982.17s]  Like I just, I'm on edge right now.
[8982.17s -> 8984.79s]  Why?
[8984.79s -> 8986.63s]  I, in my brain,
[8986.63s -> 8988.07s]  it was, I thought they were talking to,
[8988.07s -> 8989.03s]  why am I in this room?
[8989.03s -> 8990.47s]  And why is everybody looking?
[8990.47s -> 8991.83s]  Honest, that, please.
[8992.55s -> 8994.52s]  I need to relax.
[8994.52s -> 8997.69s]  I need to calm down.
[8997.69s -> 8999.18s]  Okay.
[8999.18s -> 9004.02s]  That was so completely overdone.
[9004.02s -> 9006.14s]  In my brain, it was like,
[9006.14s -> 9008.22s]  there's not a single reason ever.
[9008.22s -> 9015.94s]  Like I thought we were on the same team for a second.
[9015.94s -> 9017.86s]  It was like, oh, get the sniper rifle and support.
[9017.86s -> 9018.82s]  And they were talking.
[9018.82s -> 9020.10s]  Why am I even in the room?
[9020.10s -> 9020.98s]  Is what I'm trying to say.
[9021.62s -> 9029.43s]  Why do I shoot this?
[9031.13s -> 9034.28s]  How do you, how do you zoom in?
[9035.08s -> 9048.04s]  Was that my teammate?
[9048.04s -> 9048.68s]  I don't know.
[9052.76s -> 9054.52s]  Was that the guy I'm supposed to protect?
[9057.06s -> 9057.70s]  Fuck.
[9057.70s -> 9058.74s]  I think that was,
[9058.74s -> 9060.02s]  I think that was a good guy.
[9067.05s -> 9069.69s]  He was just in the cut scene.
[9075.86s -> 9079.45s]  I'm so stupid.
[9081.02s -> 9081.50s]  I don't know.
[9081.50s -> 9082.78s]  It's just like, there's a,
[9082.78s -> 9086.38s]  just a trailing short-term memory where it just ends.
[9086.94s -> 9089.02s]  There's a period where I'll remember anything,
[9089.66s -> 9093.50s]  but it just ends here and it just moves along on a track.
[9093.50s -> 9097.10s]  And it's just everything that's back behind here is gone
[9098.62s -> 9099.50s]  in short-term memory.
[9101.80s -> 9103.24s]  I can't believe I did that.
[9109.53s -> 9113.78s]  Do you see people are talking and it's like,
[9113.78s -> 9114.58s]  look, help.
[9114.58s -> 9116.34s]  We were all talking about helping each other.
[9116.58s -> 9117.86s]  I've got a clear shot.
[9118.42s -> 9119.14s]  Confirm.
[9119.14s -> 9119.94s]  Take the shot.
[9121.08s -> 9121.64s]  Sure thing.
[9130.49s -> 9132.09s]  Cover the stairs below the roof.
[9132.09s -> 9132.33s]  Okay.
[9132.33s -> 9133.13s]  All right, all right, right, right.
[9141.98s -> 9143.50s]  No, that's somebody else on the team.
[9144.06s -> 9145.26s]  That's somebody else.
[9145.26s -> 9146.30s]  Where do you want me to fight?
[9153.37s -> 9155.69s]  What the hell are you, what?
[9192.63s -> 9203.42s]  Cover the stairs below the roof.
[9203.42s -> 9207.42s]  Why can you even walk forward?
[9207.42s -> 9213.22s]  Why can you walk forward there?
[9213.22s -> 9215.22s]  What is your field of fire?
[9215.22s -> 9216.34s]  I've got the runway.
[9216.34s -> 9217.38s]  How about the hangar?
[9218.02s -> 9219.54s]  I have a blindfold on.
[9219.54s -> 9221.14s]  I've got activity below.
[9221.14s -> 9222.98s]  It's one of the suspects, the female.
[9222.98s -> 9224.63s]  A clear shot.
[9225.67s -> 9230.94s]  Let's take the shot on the tower.
[9230.94s -> 9232.30s]  Machine gunner, lower balcony.
[9234.23s -> 9235.43s]  I have to throw this guy out.
[9240.63s -> 9241.03s]  Okay.
[9241.03s -> 9244.23s]  So where, what do I have to do on the lower staircase?
[9249.99s -> 9250.31s]  Shit.
[9253.24s -> 9253.80s]  Down here.
[9256.71s -> 9258.15s]  These motherfuckers right here.
[9259.03s -> 9276.07s]  Get to the balcony downstairs and help.
[9276.07s -> 9307.19s]  Okay.
[9307.19s -> 9307.99s]  Come on.
[9307.99s -> 9309.03s]  There's no way.
[9309.03s -> 9310.46s]  That kills you.
[9310.46s -> 9312.06s]  There's no way that kills you.
[9312.06s -> 9316.34s]  How far down do we have to go?
[9316.34s -> 9316.98s]  Times up.
[9316.98s -> 9321.74s]  No, it's not up.
[9321.74s -> 9323.10s]  What is your field of fire?
[9323.10s -> 9331.10s]  Who are you talking to still?
[9360.84s -> 9362.28s]  This is such a weird angle too.
[9386.20s -> 9387.48s]  What do you mean I passed it?
[9387.48s -> 9389.40s]  Guys, come on.
[9389.40s -> 9390.68s]  This is a fool me once scenario.
[9391.80s -> 9392.92s]  There's always just a dead end.
[9393.56s -> 9394.76s]  Five feet in front of these doors.
[9408.82s -> 9409.06s]  No.
[9409.62s -> 9416.18s]  I'm back to the top of the tower.
[9416.90s -> 9420.76s]  Are you serious?
[9420.76s -> 9434.94s]  I just, okay, we're good.
[9434.94s -> 9435.26s]  All right.
[9435.98s -> 9438.06s]  In exactly five minutes, I'm moving on.
[9438.06s -> 9453.08s]  I promise.
[9459.26s -> 9464.98s]  They shot the cover off the front tire.
[9464.98s -> 9471.29s]  Take the tire out of the plane or the car.
[9471.29s -> 9476.36s]  I don't think that's how that would work.
[9476.36s -> 9477.96s]  But you know, whatever.
[9480.73s -> 9481.53s]  Where are they?
[9533.58s -> 9540.81s]  You have to take out that copter with a sniper rifle.
[9547.05s -> 9547.37s]  Okay.
[9559.06s -> 9560.34s]  It was like a little animal.
[9568.82s -> 9569.38s]  Give me a chance.
[9579.85s -> 9581.05s]  2.5 minutes left.
[9581.05s -> 9584.17s]  Yeah, I have to do that again.
[9587.74s -> 9589.82s]  Oh, I hope I can do this twice.
[9589.82s -> 9592.70s]  This game is awesome though.
[9592.70s -> 9594.94s]  I might just come back and play this another like later.
[9594.94s -> 9608.34s]  Okay.
[9608.34s -> 9608.58s]  All right.
[9608.58s -> 9611.96s]  Get out, get out, get out.
[9611.96s -> 9614.39s]  Where is the where's it right in front of me?
[9662.74s -> 9702.73s]  Is he alive?
[9702.73s -> 9703.62s]  Was he dead?
[9703.62s -> 9704.18s]  Is he alive?
[9704.18s -> 9705.14s]  I don't know if he's, is he dead?
[9709.37s -> 9710.49s]  That was unfair.
[9710.49s -> 9712.17s]  That was actually unfair.
[9712.17s -> 9716.95s]  I thought he was still alive.
[9716.95s -> 9719.19s]  I thought he was going to shoot me like three or four more times.
[9721.14s -> 9722.10s]  Time's up.
[9722.10s -> 9724.78s]  5.46 is the prediction.
[9724.78s -> 9725.18s]  Okay.
[9728.66s -> 9729.54s]  I had that too.
[9730.42s -> 9735.69s]  That was annoying.
[9735.69s -> 9736.73s]  You have 15 seconds.
[9736.73s -> 9737.45s]  5.46.
[9740.10s -> 9749.88s]  So the mods have told me.
[9749.88s -> 9763.26s]  I wonder.
[9763.26s -> 9764.06s]  Oh, yeah.
[9764.70s -> 9765.02s]  All right.
[9765.02s -> 9768.15s]  I got it right here.
[9768.15s -> 9769.35s]  You just got to go right in.
[9775.13s -> 9775.77s]  What?
[9775.77s -> 9776.41s]  Get the help.
[9778.50s -> 9781.64s]  What?
[9781.64s -> 9782.36s]  Who just did that?
[9783.08s -> 9785.70s]  What's this?
[9786.42s -> 9794.92s]  Did I skip a cut scene?
[9796.23s -> 9797.83s]  There was no way to go down.
[9797.83s -> 9799.75s]  Did I skip the cut scene?
[9799.75s -> 9810.34s]  I heard hurry up.
[9810.34s -> 9812.26s]  I'm I'm I'll get it right now.
[9812.26s -> 9816.58s]  I got the strategy door opened.
[9816.58s -> 9817.30s]  You didn't even look.
[9817.30s -> 9818.66s]  I did.
[9818.66s -> 9822.17s]  But I didn't know I had literally five seconds to move.
[9822.73s -> 9825.54s]  It just was like, oh, get the heck out of there.
[9825.54s -> 9825.78s]  Okay.
[9825.78s -> 9826.58s]  Get the heck out of there.
[9827.78s -> 9832.33s]  You know, many times we've heard get out of there in this game in the last two and a half hours.
[9864.78s -> 9865.18s]  Okay.
[9865.18s -> 9868.38s]  I was going to say there's not a single chance that would happen.
[9868.38s -> 9880.81s]  I can't believe I shot this guy in that.
[9886.95s -> 9887.75s]  We'll need a car.
[9888.79s -> 9889.27s]  Wait, what?
[9890.07s -> 9893.54s]  Weren't we just going down?
[9893.54s -> 9894.58s]  Why are we back up?
[9894.58s -> 9895.94s]  I thought the whole point was to get out of here.
[9902.49s -> 9904.39s]  Is this a full letter grade?
[9904.39s -> 9905.67s]  Because if it is, I am not leaving.
[9924.89s -> 9928.87s]  That person's dead.
[9929.43s -> 9930.47s]  That person is dead.
[9931.11s -> 9954.02s]  I thought it was supposed to be exactly five more minutes.
[9954.02s -> 9954.82s]  It is.
[9954.82s -> 9957.54s]  But if there's a if I get to actually drive the car, I get to add it.
[9957.54s -> 9959.38s]  Hey, ghost, I've tapped in.
[9959.38s -> 9960.66s]  No, I don't care.
[9961.70s -> 9962.90s]  Do you want me to leave now?
[9962.90s -> 9963.38s]  No way.
[9964.50s -> 9999.29s]  Don't lose it.
[10000.65s -> 10002.09s]  Drive the car.
[10002.09s -> 10002.49s]  Drive.
[10003.53s -> 10004.98s]  Now he's on that plane.
[10005.54s -> 10015.48s]  I love the way he's driving too.
[10015.48s -> 10027.54s]  This is a great game.
[10027.54s -> 10028.66s]  I love this game.
[10028.66s -> 10031.90s]  It gets it.
[10031.90s -> 10037.50s]  I know it's like an old lady.
[10038.94s -> 10059.40s]  Is there a horn?
[10059.96s -> 10082.84s]  What are they dropping?
[10107.77s -> 10112.33s]  Someone fell out of the plane.
[10115.13s -> 10125.83s]  Who fell out of the plane?
[10141.54s -> 10142.26s]  Who is this?
[10146.50s -> 10147.46s]  What is happening?
[10148.26s -> 10153.86s]  Did they fall out of the plane?
[10179.83s -> 10180.95s]  What am I supposed to be doing?
[10183.16s -> 10184.44s]  I just don't understand.
[10190.84s -> 10191.80s]  Go up the ramp?
[10195.96s -> 10197.40s]  This car is smoking.
[10198.20s -> 10199.50s]  There's a ramp?
[10200.30s -> 10208.90s]  I'm on top of their car.
[10219.06s -> 10219.78s]  What ramp?
[10220.50s -> 10221.30s]  There was a ramp?
[10226.87s -> 10229.74s]  There's an arrow.
[10229.74s -> 10230.54s]  Follow the arrow.
[10230.54s -> 10232.46s]  Don't do 10 HA's.
[10234.38s -> 10235.10s]  Hey, ghost.
[10235.10s -> 10235.74s]  I'll get it right now.
[10235.74s -> 10236.46s]  Tapped in.
[10236.46s -> 10237.50s]  Car CB radio.
[10238.22s -> 10239.42s]  Keep following the plane.
[10240.14s -> 10240.70s]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[10240.70s -> 10243.02s]  I couldn't see the ramp with all the mud on the screen.
[10243.90s -> 10262.71s]  Play Breath of the Wild.
[10265.19s -> 10265.83s]  Not today.
[10266.71s -> 10293.45s]  I'm just waiting for him to turn around and do that look.
[10296.38s -> 10297.42s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right.
[10298.22s -> 10298.86s]  Pay attention.
[10306.76s -> 10309.19s]  Someone's falling out of the plane.
[10309.19s -> 10309.69s]  Okay.
[10312.95s -> 10314.15s]  Pick him up when he lands.
[10315.19s -> 10315.99s]  Don't lose him.
[10316.79s -> 10321.34s]  I didn't see anybody fall out of the plane.
[10350.52s -> 10351.64s]  I didn't even see it.
[10351.64s -> 10352.92s]  I accidentally just did that.
[10352.92s -> 10353.32s]  How would you?
[10353.32s -> 10355.40s]  How did you even see that was here?
[10355.40s -> 10356.84s]  How did you know that was here?
[10357.48s -> 10385.08s]  My car can't even fit through this fucking hole.
[10385.08s -> 10387.24s]  Am I going the right way?
[10394.68s -> 10395.88s]  This is insane.
[10397.32s -> 10397.96s]  Oh, no.
[10406.25s -> 10407.05s]  Please push me.
[10407.37s -> 10409.21s]  Push me, push me, push me, push me, push me.
[10409.85s -> 10410.41s]  Push me out.
[10411.46s -> 10412.02s]  Drive forward.
[10412.02s -> 10412.66s]  Push me out.
[10412.66s -> 10413.62s]  Please drive forward.
[10414.34s -> 10415.86s]  Drive forward and push me out.
[10418.33s -> 10418.73s]  Please.
[10418.73s -> 10419.53s]  I don't want to do this again.
[10419.53s -> 10420.17s]  Drive forward.
[10445.78s -> 10446.58s]  Push me out.
[10449.78s -> 10451.22s]  Oh, it's so close.
[10451.22s -> 10451.54s]  Do it.
[10451.54s -> 10451.94s]  Keep going.
[10451.94s -> 10452.26s]  Keep going.
[10452.26s -> 10454.10s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[10454.10s -> 10454.42s]  Yes.
[10455.22s -> 10472.20s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[10472.84s -> 10482.79s]  This driving level is...
[10483.75s -> 10484.95s]  I just...
[10484.95s -> 10486.87s]  Damn, he's going to beat you to axle.
[10486.87s -> 10487.37s]  What?
[10487.99s -> 10496.92s]  Whatever you do is that car.
[10498.84s -> 10503.11s]  This car is...
[10503.11s -> 10504.07s]  I can't have control.
[10519.72s -> 10521.88s]  I can't see because of the smoke.
[10521.88s -> 10522.36s]  Am I going...
[10522.92s -> 10528.18s]  He's getting away with the axle.
[10537.85s -> 10547.72s]  Which way?
[10548.52s -> 10556.28s]  Did I accidentally pick the right door?
[10556.28s -> 10559.42s]  Oh, my God.
[10559.42s -> 10560.30s]  That was unbelievable.
[10560.30s -> 10562.12s]  That was ridiculous.
[10562.12s -> 10563.32s]  That was so hard.
[10566.42s -> 10567.46s]  I loved it, though.
[10567.46s -> 10583.22s]  Pretty good wall run by that car.
[10613.83s -> 10614.31s]  Hold on.
[10614.31s -> 10615.91s]  Okay, I'll call you when we get close.
[10615.91s -> 10616.41s]  Wait.
[10628.18s -> 10633.99s]  This is fun.
[10633.99s -> 10635.43s]  I guess you were due for some luck.
[10635.59s -> 10636.79s]  Did you get Soren out?
[10636.79s -> 10637.29s]  Yeah.
[10637.67s -> 10639.11s]  And call the rest of the fleet.
[10639.11s -> 10639.61s]  Good.
[10639.99s -> 10643.16s]  Let's get the hell out of here.
[10643.16s -> 10644.68s]  Remember, I fully support you.
[10644.68s -> 10653.19s]  Just play this all day and do Xbox another night.
[10653.19s -> 10656.63s]  Let's just watch this last DMCA cutscene and we'll figure it out.
[10657.19s -> 10661.69s]  Axel, that's your dust-off.
[10661.69s -> 10662.81s]  I think we're all right.
[10662.81s -> 10663.31s]  I'll move on.
[10663.31s -> 10664.81s]  I'm sorry, guys, you wouldn't have done what you did.
[10664.81s -> 10666.95s]  Thank you for it.
[10666.95s -> 10668.95s]  Depends on how interesting the next mission starts.
[10668.95s -> 10669.51s]  I'd rather kill you.
[10669.51s -> 10670.01s]  You know what I mean?
[10670.39s -> 10673.19s]  I'm just glad fate brought you to the airport.
[10673.19s -> 10675.48s]  I'm not sure you'll agree with that tomorrow.
[10676.04s -> 10677.64s]  Just tell Soren midnight.
[10677.64s -> 10678.52s]  He'll know the place.
[10679.72s -> 10691.82s]  He is fast.
[10691.82s -> 10692.46s]  I will say that.
[10692.46s -> 10693.18s]  Come back to this game.
[10704.60s -> 10707.00s]  72 hours.
[10708.30s -> 10709.50s]  72?
[10711.58s -> 10712.54s]  What did you just say?
[10713.34s -> 10718.02s]  That's exactly how long, Zion.
[10718.02s -> 10719.54s]  What do you mean and who are you?
[10720.66s -> 10721.16s]  Me?
[10721.54s -> 10724.39s]  I thought that was Adam Sandler for one second.
[10729.56s -> 10731.64s]  72 hours.
[10731.64s -> 10737.51s]  I don't know why.
[10741.54s -> 10742.34s]  Actually, how?
[10742.34s -> 10742.82s]  I don't know.
[10743.62s -> 10745.14s]  It was like 72 hours.
[10749.37s -> 10751.70s]  It's just 72 hours.
[10751.70s -> 10752.20s]  Right?
[10752.66s -> 10766.71s]  That was a bad imitation.
[10767.35s -> 10767.91s]  No, it wasn't.
[10767.91s -> 10768.63s]  That was fine.
[10770.76s -> 10771.32s]  You're here.
[10771.32s -> 10777.29s]  Ghost?
[10777.29s -> 10778.09s]  No wrestling?
[10778.09s -> 10778.59s]  No, I-
[10778.59s -> 10779.13s]  We're waiting.
[10779.13s -> 10779.63s]  Just wait.
[10780.25s -> 10781.83s]  Has everyone arrived?
[10781.83s -> 10782.79s]  That sounded like Yoda.
[10782.79s -> 10784.07s]  I have a Kineser.
[10784.07s -> 10784.57s]  Figures.
[10785.11s -> 10786.58s]  Think for an entrance.
[10799.05s -> 10799.55s]  Captains.
[10802.12s -> 10803.40s]  Captain Niobe.
[10803.40s -> 10805.40s]  My crew and I appreciate what you did for us.
[10805.40s -> 10807.00s]  It's not illegal if it's on a video game disc.
[10807.00s -> 10807.96s]  He's alive.
[10807.96s -> 10809.22s]  Happy to be.
[10809.22s -> 10809.94s]  Let's get going.
[10809.94s -> 10812.98s]  Because you know Morpheus is not going to show up until we get started.
[10812.98s -> 10813.54s]  I agree.
[10813.54s -> 10816.02s]  I don't like us all being in the same place for too long.
[10816.02s -> 10818.18s]  Why don't you tell us what this is all about, Niobe?
[10818.18s -> 10820.18s]  The machines are digging.
[10824.25s -> 10825.53s]  Tell that to the judge.
[10850.81s -> 10851.31s]  Shit.
[10851.31s -> 10854.09s]  It's the feds.
[10855.29s -> 10856.17s]  Get to your exits.
[10862.66s -> 10866.42s]  You know, they could just cut the pipes up there so nobody has to duck anymore.
[10866.42s -> 10871.83s]  Get some pipes, these cutters, and just cut the top.
[10871.83s -> 10872.71s]  People don't-
[10872.71s -> 10874.55s]  You've clearly cut them already.
[10874.55s -> 10875.91s]  They're perfectly cut.
[10875.91s -> 10876.41s]  Straight across.
[10877.03s -> 10878.31s]  Go up by one- two feet.
[10879.86s -> 10880.66s]  All right, here we go.
[10881.46s -> 10882.02s]  Is this-
[10883.27s -> 10885.43s]  Beginning of this mission interesting enough for me to keep playing?
[10885.43s -> 10886.07s]  Let's find out.
[10887.11s -> 10895.94s]  I'm telling you, if he hops on a motorcycle, I ain't going anywhere.
[10896.58s -> 10901.18s]  All right, that was pretty funny.
[10901.18s -> 10901.90s]  I might have to stay.
[10902.46s -> 10924.52s]  So Legends of Wrestling is coming up next.
[10924.52s -> 10926.76s]  Seems like a fun thing to do.
[10926.76s -> 10928.95s]  Seems like an interesting game to play.
[10930.18s -> 10931.14s]  That was the Matrix.
[10931.14s -> 10932.70s]  Enter the Matrix.
[10932.70s -> 10933.42s]  We're going to move on.
[10935.16s -> 10942.62s]  Let me just make sure I don't burn the screen in with the next thing.
[10942.62s -> 10943.26s]  I just-
[10943.26s -> 10953.22s]  I don't really want to climb up all that right now.
[10953.22s -> 10953.78s]  All right.
[10953.78s -> 10955.54s]  Legends of Wrestling, where are you?
[10955.54s -> 10966.30s]  Did he beat it?
[10966.30s -> 10966.78s]  No, I didn't.
[10967.42s -> 10969.03s]  I did not beat it.
[10969.59s -> 10973.58s]  Will you go back to the Matrix?
[10975.66s -> 10977.22s]  I mean, that was really fun.
[10978.84s -> 10979.32s]  Maybe.
[10979.32s -> 10980.04s]  I don't know.
[10980.04s -> 10981.32s]  We gave it a solid three hours.
[10983.58s -> 10985.26s]  That was double overtime.
[10985.26s -> 10990.44s]  That was a double overtime.
[10996.06s -> 10999.42s]  Usually it's about 40 minutes to an hour for each one of these.
[10999.42s -> 11001.69s]  I thought it was double, triple overtime almost.
[11007.77s -> 11008.57s]  Okay, here we go.
[11008.57s -> 11013.61s]  Hold on.
[11013.61s -> 11014.09s]  Can you see?
[11015.78s -> 11017.38s]  A great disc loading action.
[11018.79s -> 11019.29s]  Yeah.
[11056.76s -> 11057.32s]  All right.
[11057.32s -> 11058.04s]  I'm interested.
[11058.92s -> 11077.90s]  Everyone is so hyped for me to play this, but I don't know.
[11077.90s -> 11079.58s]  I feel like this is maybe-
[11080.54s -> 11081.04s]  Wait.
[11081.66s -> 11082.22s]  I don't know.
[11083.02s -> 11084.49s]  I'm not going to pretend to know.
[11085.21s -> 11088.68s]  Because this could just be kind of not that fun.
[11090.12s -> 11090.68s]  I don't know.
[11092.10s -> 11094.90s]  This game is legitimately not that good.
[11094.90s -> 11095.86s]  That's what somebody just said.
[11100.26s -> 11100.98s]  Okay.
[11100.98s -> 11111.53s]  Hold on.
[11111.53s -> 11112.41s]  Ban that guy?
[11124.84s -> 11139.11s]  We're creating a wrestler.
[11139.11s -> 11140.07s]  Barrel chest?
[11140.07s -> 11140.71s]  Heavyweight.
[11143.00s -> 11143.40s]  Muscle?
[11145.37s -> 11145.77s]  Skinny?
[11146.49s -> 11148.10s]  The audio is bad?
[11154.41s -> 11154.91s]  Skinny?
[11156.36s -> 11156.86s]  Skinny?
[11159.37s -> 11160.09s]  All right, fine.
[11178.06s -> 11179.82s]  How about Mean Green?
[11179.82s -> 11189.24s]  That's fine.
[11189.32s -> 11190.28s]  Wait, modify.
[11191.16s -> 11191.88s]  Oh, hold on.
[11201.38s -> 11203.30s]  Light, medium, or heavy hair?
[11205.06s -> 11207.30s]  Oh, it's how much hair is on my body?
[11208.02s -> 11216.76s]  Okay.
[11221.14s -> 11221.78s]  Upper body.
[11246.23s -> 11247.03s]  I like this one.
[11254.87s -> 11256.55s]  He has sprayed on clothes.
[11275.24s -> 11275.74s]  All right.
[11279.53s -> 11280.25s]  Right arm?
[11281.21s -> 11281.61s]  Hold on.
[11281.61s -> 11283.45s]  Can I have like a huge arm?
[11287.48s -> 11288.04s]  Okay.
[11288.04s -> 11290.04s]  He's going to have a huge right arm.
[11290.84s -> 11308.28s]  Goodness.
[11309.72s -> 11311.16s]  Should I have diney hands?
[11311.88s -> 11313.48s]  Like, diney hands are huge hands.
[11316.28s -> 11316.52s]  Hold on.
[11316.52s -> 11317.56s]  This is really loud.
[11323.93s -> 11324.43s]  Tiny?
[11324.97s -> 11327.51s]  Let's see what it looks like when it's huge, though.
[11338.12s -> 11338.36s]  Okay.
[11338.92s -> 11339.48s]  I'm sorry.
[11339.48s -> 11339.96s]  It's that.
[11347.46s -> 11348.98s]  Wait, diseased?
[11348.98s -> 11349.94s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[11357.77s -> 11359.29s]  I'm going to do ripped.
[11359.29s -> 11369.77s]  Okay.
[11371.67s -> 11372.31s]  Left arm.
[11419.32s -> 11419.82s]  Okay.
[11422.58s -> 11423.46s]  Wait, torso.
[11423.46s -> 11424.74s]  Torso, torso.
[11424.74s -> 11425.37s]  Should I?
[11425.37s -> 11425.77s]  No, no.
[11425.77s -> 11426.33s]  Keep it that way.
[11428.81s -> 11429.93s]  Lower body pelvis.
[11437.18s -> 11438.30s]  Should I have a huge?
[11441.80s -> 11443.08s]  You're making a crab.
[11450.76s -> 11452.12s]  That's just strange looking.
[11453.10s -> 11453.60s]  Okay.
[11454.14s -> 11479.43s]  Do these all be tiny?
[11480.78s -> 11481.82s]  Make it opposites.
[11491.46s -> 11493.38s]  You couldn't even stand on these.
[11495.16s -> 11495.80s]  This is...
[11495.80s -> 11496.04s]  Okay.
[11496.04s -> 11498.52s]  It just looks like somebody pinched and went like this.
[11554.76s -> 11555.64s]  That doesn't look right.
[11556.28s -> 11566.18s]  Please mute the sound.
[11568.41s -> 11568.81s]  There.
[11568.81s -> 11569.53s]  It's not as bad.
[11605.88s -> 11614.84s]  I don't know.
[11614.84s -> 11616.20s]  No, it's definitely tiny.
[11616.20s -> 11635.29s]  I kind of want to take the mask off and have it just have this.
[11635.29s -> 11645.32s]  I love how it's coming through the mask.
[11645.32s -> 11646.28s]  Okay, hold on.
[11646.28s -> 11671.22s]  It stays on skinny.
[11671.22s -> 11672.82s]  It's staying on skinny.
[11672.82s -> 11680.95s]  Yeah, take it off.
[11680.95s -> 11681.19s]  Take...
[11681.19s -> 11684.25s]  Yeah, just none.
[11684.25s -> 11686.20s]  Okay, I think we're good.
[11686.20s -> 11691.90s]  Entrance gear?
[11691.90s -> 11692.30s]  Iron?
[11694.10s -> 11694.98s]  A flag?
[11695.54s -> 11697.90s]  A scepter?
[11697.90s -> 11700.87s]  A spear?
[11700.87s -> 11702.87s]  He's going to come out with the US flag.
[11706.57s -> 11707.21s]  A spear?
[11708.01s -> 11714.74s]  He's going to come out with a scepter.
[11727.21s -> 11728.25s]  I don't know.
[11728.25s -> 11739.77s]  He's coming out with a cape.
[11739.85s -> 11741.21s]  He should come out with a hat.
[11741.21s -> 11760.79s]  This guy sucks.
[11760.79s -> 11763.96s]  Okay, you know what this looks like to me?
[11763.96s -> 11764.68s]  It's just like what...
[11764.68s -> 11769.34s]  This looks like an AI-generated person.
[11769.34s -> 11776.46s]  It's like, oh, a man with a hat on holding a scepter has big legs and is very muscular.
[11776.46s -> 11789.42s]  It's like this is what it makes.
[11789.42s -> 11790.30s]  Kind of like that.
[11790.30s -> 11798.26s]  I like that.
[11798.26s -> 11808.50s]  I can't wait to lose every match.
[11808.50s -> 11811.93s]  Okay, I think I'm ready.
[11811.93s -> 11812.33s]  Weight?
[11812.33s -> 11820.28s]  What about attributes?
[11820.28s -> 11821.72s]  Strong?
[11821.72s -> 11824.52s]  Super charismatic?
[11824.52s -> 11825.08s]  That's all.
[11825.08s -> 11829.26s]  I can't do any more points.
[11829.26s -> 11829.98s]  No, fuck that.
[11830.22s -> 11831.42s]  Everybody just loves this guy.
[11831.42s -> 11832.22s]  You know what I mean?
[11832.22s -> 11844.42s]  Brawling?
[11844.42s -> 11845.88s]  All right, high risk.
[11845.88s -> 11848.36s]  Cheating?
[11848.36s -> 11849.48s]  Hold on.
[11849.48s -> 11850.60s]  High risk or cheating?
[11850.60s -> 11854.60s]  What's better?
[11854.60s -> 11855.48s]  Definitely cheating.
[11855.48s -> 11855.96s]  There's no way.
[11855.96s -> 11857.48s]  I'm definitely cheating.
[11857.48s -> 11873.86s]  Okay, size?
[11873.86s -> 11876.41s]  That is just...
[11876.41s -> 11877.45s]  Okay, that's not...
[11877.45s -> 11878.49s]  That doesn't do anything.
[11878.49s -> 11888.71s]  Okay, appearance.
[11888.71s -> 11889.59s]  I already did that.
[11889.59s -> 11892.23s]  What do you think?
[11892.23s -> 11893.99s]  The name is very important here.
[11893.99s -> 11896.54s]  Make him short.
[11896.54s -> 11901.32s]  Five, six.
[11901.32s -> 11907.88s]  The crab?
[11907.88s -> 11911.26s]  What did you say?
[11911.26s -> 11912.46s]  Look at...
[11912.46s -> 11914.36s]  He's such a cheater.
[11914.36s -> 11916.44s]  No, I'm not going to name this guy Berserker.
[11916.44s -> 11922.92s]  The Berserker.
[11938.41s -> 11944.54s]  Okay, fine.
[11944.54s -> 11945.58s]  Crowd?
[11945.58s -> 11946.46s]  Names?
[11946.46s -> 11947.74s]  Music manager?
[11947.74s -> 11950.60s]  What do you mean, crowd?
[11950.60s -> 11951.56s]  Eat dirt?
[11951.56s -> 11952.68s]  Or, no, loved.
[11952.68s -> 11955.26s]  Do I have a manager?
[11955.26s -> 11955.90s]  Music.
[11955.90s -> 11971.88s]  Wait, can we hear it?
[11971.88s -> 11975.18s]  This is not Hulk Hogan's music.
[11975.18s -> 11977.61s]  This is not even close.
[11977.61s -> 11978.57s]  What is this?
[11978.57s -> 11993.72s]  Are these all just DMCA versions?
[11993.72s -> 11996.97s]  Yeah, they're all royalty-free versions.
[11996.97s -> 12015.75s]  But they're not even close.
[12015.75s -> 12016.71s]  I know...
[12016.71s -> 12024.81s]  I know Bret Hart's music.
[12024.81s -> 12028.49s]  No, it really is royalty-free versions.
[12030.15s -> 12032.15s]  Why would they have the rights to the wrestlers
[12032.15s -> 12033.43s]  but not their entrance musics?
[12034.07s -> 12043.67s]  Somebody said these are iCarly beats?
[12045.96s -> 12047.88s]  iCarly beats?
[12047.88s -> 12071.51s]  It's this no way you're going to convince me
[12071.51s -> 12074.20s]  it's not this one.
[12074.20s -> 12075.80s]  This one is so dumb.
[12075.80s -> 12080.81s]  This is Jerry Lawler's music but not...
[12080.81s -> 12081.37s]  It's...
[12081.37s -> 12081.85s]  This is the...
[12081.85s -> 12082.41s]  Okay.
[12082.41s -> 12084.49s]  These are the dream versions of this music.
[12086.74s -> 12087.30s]  Like, that was...
[12087.86s -> 12088.82s]  That was what was playing
[12088.82s -> 12090.82s]  but that's not what was playing in the dream.
[12111.05s -> 12112.17s]  Look at iCarly.
[12112.81s -> 12140.71s]  These are all so good.
[12140.71s -> 12141.67s]  I don't know.
[12144.23s -> 12144.79s]  Wait, hold on.
[12144.79s -> 12146.07s]  We have to hit a drop on this one.
[12146.63s -> 12194.65s]  This is just the intro to Monster Rancher.
[12194.65s -> 12200.17s]  Oh, no, it's not.
[12201.62s -> 12201.94s]  It's...
[12202.50s -> 12204.42s]  It's that song.
[12209.58s -> 12210.38s]  I think I have to go...
[12211.10s -> 12211.98s]  Look at how many there is.
[12215.83s -> 12217.83s]  I think I have my choice already.
[12218.47s -> 12219.93s]  This one has lyrics.
[12220.57s -> 12229.21s]  This is Persona music.
[12229.85s -> 12232.70s]  This plays in Persona.
[12232.70s -> 12233.74s]  It's like Persona 5.
[12234.46s -> 12259.42s]  I don't know.
[12260.30s -> 12261.82s]  Our character eats bugs.
[12261.82s -> 12263.02s]  I don't think this is...
[12263.02s -> 12263.50s]  No.
[12263.50s -> 12279.51s]  We're at a joint.
[12279.51s -> 12281.67s]  That's been cooking up burgers since 1950.
[12282.47s -> 12284.31s]  Off on the corner of 1st and 2nd Street,
[12285.48s -> 12286.04s]  there's Hank.
[12293.21s -> 12293.93s]  The atmosphere.
[12293.93s -> 12294.89s]  I love the food here.
[12294.89s -> 12295.69s]  It's just so good.
[12296.49s -> 12298.97s]  And we're going to talk about his homemade meatballs.
[12299.69s -> 12301.70s]  Hold on a minute.
[12301.70s -> 12301.94s]  Hold on.
[12301.94s -> 12302.74s]  I have to...
[12302.74s -> 12306.71s]  What is this here, man?
[12307.35s -> 12307.83s]  There it is.
[12307.83s -> 12308.07s]  All right.
[12308.07s -> 12308.71s]  Let me take a bite.
[12315.77s -> 12316.41s]  To the onions.
[12316.97s -> 12317.93s]  When they really get in there
[12318.65s -> 12319.29s]  and you've got the...
[12319.29s -> 12319.93s]  You got the thyme.
[12319.93s -> 12321.45s]  You got the cumin in there too.
[12321.45s -> 12322.89s]  Oh, you knocked out of the park, man.
[12322.89s -> 12323.29s]  Out of the park.
[12324.09s -> 12324.97s]  Killed it.
[12324.97s -> 12346.38s]  This person doesn't have music.
[12346.38s -> 12347.10s]  Oh, yeah, they do.
[12373.53s -> 12375.77s]  I don't want to do any more reality TV shit.
[12375.77s -> 12379.13s]  I'm gonna...
[12379.13s -> 12380.49s]  Now, when you...
[12380.49s -> 12381.77s]  You don't come back here
[12381.77s -> 12383.29s]  and tell me how to run the store.
[12384.01s -> 12384.97s]  Whenever you run a store
[12384.97s -> 12386.33s]  and somebody comes up with an item
[12386.33s -> 12388.09s]  that just looks like it's worth a thousand dollars
[12388.09s -> 12389.37s]  but it could be worth millions.
[12389.37s -> 12389.77s]  This guy...
[12391.21s -> 12392.89s]  This guy came in with a sword.
[12393.77s -> 12395.85s]  I don't want you buying that sword,
[12395.85s -> 12396.81s]  you fucking idiot.
[12397.37s -> 12398.25s]  Hank Chumley.
[12398.89s -> 12399.37s]  Chumley.
[12400.09s -> 12401.21s]  Go get us lunch.
[12402.25s -> 12403.61s]  It's 1230.
[12404.41s -> 12409.80s]  Wait, there's the same song.
[12410.36s -> 12412.65s]  Dude, Storage Wars.
[12412.65s -> 12413.45s]  Storage Wars.
[12417.64s -> 12419.40s]  Every so often somebody comes in with an item.
[12419.40s -> 12420.68s]  That floors everybody.
[12420.68s -> 12421.88s]  Wows everybody, you know?
[12423.72s -> 12434.22s]  Wait, that's a one...
[12434.22s -> 12434.46s]  Oh.
[12436.34s -> 12438.02s]  I'm just having fun listening to these songs.
[12441.67s -> 12442.87s]  This is more fun than the game.
[12464.28s -> 12464.68s]  This one...
[12464.68s -> 12465.72s]  I like this one
[12465.72s -> 12475.08s]  but I just want to hear the fucking
[12475.08s -> 12477.16s]  take a bite out of the food diner's drive-ins
[12477.16s -> 12478.44s]  and dive song one more time.
[12487.40s -> 12489.16s]  I think it actually might be the song.
[12489.72s -> 12491.08s]  I think this is the song.
[12491.96s -> 12492.28s]  Right?
[12493.75s -> 12494.79s]  Just make it this one.
[12497.96s -> 12499.72s]  This is the song that plays.
[12499.72s -> 12501.00s]  I think it's the royalty...
[12501.00s -> 12501.72s]  I'm...
[12501.72s -> 12516.70s]  Hold on.
[12516.70s -> 12517.58s]  This one...
[12517.58s -> 12518.94s]  It kind of has to be this one
[12518.94s -> 12519.98s]  because if I get hit in the chair
[12519.98s -> 12520.86s]  and get injured...
[12521.58s -> 12522.95s]  If I get hit in the face of the chair
[12522.95s -> 12523.75s]  or the first match...
[12524.39s -> 12546.10s]  Fuck.
[12546.10s -> 12546.98s]  Okay, fine.
[12547.54s -> 12550.60s]  I gotta pee again.
[12551.70s -> 12552.90s]  Let me pee one more time.
[12558.42s -> 12558.98s]  I press...
[12558.98s -> 12560.42s]  Wait, there's this button.
[12560.42s -> 12714.31s]  I have a question.
[12714.31s -> 12718.68s]  Are there more episodes of One Piece
[12719.24s -> 12721.00s]  or diners drive-ins and dives?
[12728.38s -> 12737.74s]  How many episodes of One Piece are there?
[12737.74s -> 12738.22s]  One Piece?
[12738.78s -> 12741.32s]  There are about a thousand.
[12741.32s -> 12743.40s]  There are over a thousand episodes of One Piece.
[12744.04s -> 12747.16s]  How many episodes of diners drive-ins and dives are there?
[12747.16s -> 12747.88s]  Are there a thousand?
[12755.06s -> 12756.66s]  There's probably a thousand.
[12756.66s -> 12760.86s]  Google says 419.
[12761.66s -> 12763.38s]  So it's not even close.
[12763.38s -> 12763.86s]  Never mind.
[12767.98s -> 12769.58s]  All right, what about Naruto?
[12769.58s -> 12772.14s]  Are there more episodes of diners drive-ins and dives
[12772.14s -> 12772.62s]  or...
[12772.62s -> 12773.42s]  Don't burn in the screen.
[12774.54s -> 12775.10s]  It's happening.
[12775.10s -> 12775.60s]  I did it.
[12776.62s -> 12778.38s]  Okay.
[12779.02s -> 12785.90s]  It's 700.
[12785.90s -> 12786.40s]  500.
[12795.04s -> 12796.08s]  Mail average.
[12800.83s -> 12801.87s]  What was this person's name?
[12810.80s -> 12812.62s]  Crab?
[12812.62s -> 12813.82s]  Just keep mail average.
[12828.86s -> 12833.42s]  Bob Berserker?
[12834.06s -> 12839.93s]  How do you spell Berserk?
[12839.93s -> 12844.78s]  Bob Berserker.
[12844.78s -> 12848.99s]  Is there an R?
[12848.99s -> 12850.43s]  Is it like Berserk?
[12850.43s -> 12862.36s]  Or is it Berserk?
[12862.36s -> 12863.08s]  Bob Berserk.
[12863.64s -> 12864.14s]  Okay.
[12864.68s -> 12868.44s]  Short name.
[12869.24s -> 12870.18s]  Berserker?
[12872.16s -> 12887.71s]  Wait, do we need to...
[12888.67s -> 12890.68s]  Wait, what do you mean the list?
[12891.64s -> 12892.60s]  Does it say the name?
[12895.71s -> 12896.75s]  Wait, does it say these?
[12897.47s -> 12897.95s]  Hold on.
[12905.07s -> 12906.51s]  It definitely says these.
[12908.38s -> 12908.94s]  It's definitely...
[12910.70s -> 12911.66s]  Bruiser!
[12911.66s -> 12912.54s]  Burnout!
[12912.54s -> 12913.04s]  Cabbage!
[12913.58s -> 12914.08s]  Captain!
[12914.62s -> 12915.50s]  Cowboy!
[12915.50s -> 12916.54s]  Oh, you know it does.
[12917.26s -> 12918.94s]  It has to be a Z name?
[12932.32s -> 12932.82s]  Zebra!
[12934.24s -> 12934.74s]  Ugly!
[12935.87s -> 12936.37s]  Weirdo!
[12937.64s -> 12938.14s]  Zap!
[12938.60s -> 12939.10s]  Zodiac!
[12942.11s -> 12943.07s]  Here he is.
[12943.07s -> 12943.57s]  The weirdo!
[12945.68s -> 12946.40s]  Oh, man.
[12946.40s -> 12947.44s]  I'm telling you, Bob.
[12947.44s -> 12950.96s]  The weirdo is having struggling in that corner there.
[12950.96s -> 12955.12s]  Let's hope that the weirdo can get out of this without that many scars.
[12959.60s -> 12960.32s]  Middle of name?
[12964.20s -> 12965.24s]  Do Uncle Bob.
[12967.32s -> 12967.72s]  Bob.
[12967.72s -> 12968.36s]  Uncle Bob.
[12968.36s -> 12969.00s]  Uncle Bob.
[12969.00s -> 12969.64s]  Uncle Bob.
[12969.64s -> 12970.36s]  Uncle Bob.
[12970.36s -> 12971.64s]  All right, all right, all right.
[12972.44s -> 12973.16s]  Uncle Bob.
[12974.46s -> 12975.42s]  Uncle Bob.
[12975.42s -> 12976.62s]  Bob Berserker?
[12979.31s -> 12980.75s]  No, not Uncle Bob.
[12982.59s -> 12983.09s]  Shit.
[12984.05s -> 12987.33s]  Okay, that's good.
[12990.03s -> 12990.67s]  Finisher.
[12990.67s -> 12991.79s]  The Double Roundhouse.
[12992.51s -> 12994.75s]  Does it matter?
[13000.70s -> 13023.74s]  The music is very loud.
[13023.74s -> 13024.24s]  The...
[13025.81s -> 13026.31s]  The...
[13028.13s -> 13028.85s]  The Grinder.
[13031.14s -> 13031.46s]  The...
[13031.46s -> 13032.18s]  The Crusher.
[13032.74s -> 13034.02s]  The Smoosher.
[13036.64s -> 13037.84s]  I'm not calling it that.
[13041.14s -> 13042.82s]  The Stern Talk!
[13042.82s -> 13043.54s]  I like that.
[13044.51s -> 13045.23s]  I love...
[13045.23s -> 13046.91s]  The Stern Talk.
[13046.91s -> 13047.39s]  What is that?
[13047.39s -> 13047.95s]  What is that?
[13048.67s -> 13050.16s]  Imagine if you just like...
[13050.72s -> 13061.63s]  I like it.
[13061.63s -> 13062.11s]  Hometown.
[13064.13s -> 13064.61s]  I don't know.
[13064.61s -> 13065.65s]  Fucking L.A.
[13066.96s -> 13067.46s]  Where...
[13068.08s -> 13070.70s]  Who cares?
[13071.42s -> 13076.56s]  All right.
[13077.62s -> 13078.42s]  I don't want a manager.
[13085.54s -> 13088.67s]  I did save it when I came right back that first time.
[13089.31s -> 13090.13s]  Let's do it again.
[13094.94s -> 13098.22s]  I made sure before I took off because I was scared that something might go wrong.
[13108.18s -> 13109.06s]  Oh my goodness.
[13109.06s -> 13110.18s]  I forgot what it looked like.
[13111.06s -> 13111.30s]  All right.
[13111.30s -> 13112.02s]  Are you guys ready?
[13113.62s -> 13114.26s]  It's time.
[13114.82s -> 13117.71s]  It's time.
[13118.67s -> 13119.07s]  Career.
[13119.71s -> 13139.04s]  Where's the...
[13139.04s -> 13139.76s]  Where's the character?
[13140.40s -> 13142.54s]  Did it need to be a legend?
[13146.53s -> 13146.85s]  Okay.
[13146.85s -> 13147.09s]  Good.
[13154.22s -> 13154.62s]  Okay.
[13154.62s -> 13155.26s]  Let's go for it.
[13155.82s -> 13157.89s]  Pick a region.
[13159.62s -> 13160.18s]  Las Vegas.
[13160.18s -> 13160.58s]  Of course.
[13163.41s -> 13163.89s]  Options.
[13165.09s -> 13165.65s]  Costume.
[13166.37s -> 13167.17s]  Advice on.
[13168.05s -> 13168.69s]  Okay.
[13168.69s -> 13173.14s]  All right.
[13173.14s -> 13174.18s]  We're going down here.
[13174.18s -> 13176.35s]  Let's go.
[13179.46s -> 13179.86s]  Dallas.
[13180.58s -> 13183.55s]  Yes.
[13183.55s -> 13184.99s]  I wish to load wrestler one.
[13204.14s -> 13204.64s]  Why?
[13205.58s -> 13211.87s]  I thought I didn't have a manager.
[13212.43s -> 13224.75s]  Where's my...
[13224.75s -> 13225.55s]  What was my music?
[13225.55s -> 13226.19s]  Did I have it?
[13232.62s -> 13233.50s]  I don't even know how to play.
[13244.96s -> 13245.52s]  Wait.
[13246.82s -> 13257.06s]  I'm not even playing.
[13257.06s -> 13258.58s]  Why am I not playing?
[13282.42s -> 13283.78s]  Uncle Bob.
[13283.78s -> 13285.06s]  Bob Berserker.
[13285.62s -> 13307.55s]  Are we going to do this for everybody?
[13309.38s -> 13310.66s]  Everybody's going to get one of these.
[13313.01s -> 13313.41s]  All right.
[13313.41s -> 13314.85s]  I'm skipping the rest of these people.
[13316.13s -> 13317.01s]  Is it Aquaman?
[13328.61s -> 13329.73s]  Don't skip.
[13329.73s -> 13336.62s]  So what's the match?
[13336.62s -> 13348.03s]  Are we just going to hang out and just...
[13348.03s -> 13348.35s]  Shit.
[13349.07s -> 13351.15s]  This camera angle is so bad.
[13352.34s -> 13353.14s]  How do I fight?
[13360.34s -> 13361.22s]  Oh, shit.
[13364.26s -> 13364.58s]  What?
[13372.86s -> 13374.30s]  Did I lose that fast?
[13377.89s -> 13379.57s]  Aquaman was doing the same face.
[13384.29s -> 13385.25s]  Boring moves.
[13386.13s -> 13387.25s]  Ignored your partner.
[13388.29s -> 13389.41s]  Minimal combos.
[13390.77s -> 13392.37s]  Zero percent popularity.
[13408.67s -> 13410.10s]  Okay.
[13410.10s -> 13412.12s]  Good.
[13415.74s -> 13417.66s]  I guess we're staying here.
[13418.38s -> 13430.53s]  I'm telling you.
[13430.53s -> 13431.73s]  Buttons didn't do anything.
[13433.33s -> 13434.13s]  I pressed X.
[13434.13s -> 13434.85s]  I pressed Y.
[13434.85s -> 13435.57s]  I pressed V.
[13435.57s -> 13437.01s]  I pressed the trigger buttons.
[13437.01s -> 13438.29s]  Nothing seemed to do anything.
[13438.85s -> 13445.22s]  Why are they booing me?
[13445.22s -> 13446.50s]  I'm supposed to be a fan favorite.
[13473.92s -> 13475.12s]  Why are they booing me?
[13475.68s -> 13502.64s]  Okay.
[13502.64s -> 13505.63s]  Let's not lose immediately, please.
[13506.43s -> 13516.27s]  I did a move.
[13516.27s -> 13516.75s]  I did a move.
[13523.79s -> 13524.43s]  Oh, shit.
[13524.99s -> 13530.98s]  Extreme damage.
[13544.99s -> 13546.67s]  We're playing on concrete right now.
[13546.67s -> 13548.35s]  There was no give to this ring.
[13548.35s -> 13559.54s]  Shit.
[13560.18s -> 13597.38s]  How did you do the same move?
[13597.38s -> 13597.78s]  How do I...
[13597.78s -> 13598.66s]  I want to get out of the ring.
[13605.87s -> 13607.39s]  That's got to hurt with an arm that big.
[13607.95s -> 13613.57s]  How do I climb the top?
[13616.62s -> 13649.17s]  Let go.
[13649.17s -> 13650.69s]  I think it's like a fighting game.
[13650.69s -> 13652.21s]  I think I have to do like down...
[13652.77s -> 13653.89s]  Like left down up.
[13653.89s -> 13654.37s]  Left down up.
[13654.37s -> 13654.77s]  Hey.
[13654.77s -> 13671.97s]  Left down up clicks.
[13671.97s -> 13672.29s]  Nice.
[13683.89s -> 13684.37s]  Oh, shit.
[13684.37s -> 13685.17s]  They don't like it.
[13686.45s -> 13687.97s]  They are actually pissed.
[13688.61s -> 13700.27s]  Uh-oh.
[13700.27s -> 13707.68s]  Where are you going?
[13707.68s -> 13708.18s]  Uh-oh.
[13709.66s -> 13710.14s]  How do I run?
[13710.14s -> 13710.70s]  How do I run away?
[13710.70s -> 13711.18s]  How do I run?
[13711.18s -> 13711.58s]  How do I run?
[13711.58s -> 13712.06s]  How do I run?
[13712.06s -> 13712.78s]  How do I pick that up?
[13713.34s -> 13716.59s]  Pick that up.
[13716.59s -> 13717.07s]  How do I pick it up?
[13717.07s -> 13717.31s]  Pick it up.
[13717.31s -> 13717.55s]  Pick it up.
[13717.55s -> 13717.79s]  Pick it up.
[13717.79s -> 13718.03s]  Pick it up.
[13718.03s -> 13718.51s]  Pick that up.
[13719.55s -> 13722.61s]  How do I pick...
[13727.97s -> 13729.41s]  How do I pick the chair up?
[13734.43s -> 13735.55s]  Oh, I am fucked here.
[13735.55s -> 13735.95s]  It's over.
[13735.95s -> 13736.91s]  There's no way I'm getting up.
[13746.53s -> 13746.77s]  No.
[13747.33s -> 13762.38s]  My goodness.
[13763.79s -> 13764.51s]  I'm dead.
[13764.51s -> 13765.31s]  I'm not getting up.
[13773.76s -> 13774.08s]  Run.
[13774.08s -> 13774.56s]  Run away.
[13774.56s -> 13775.04s]  Run away.
[13775.04s -> 13775.44s]  Run away.
[13775.44s -> 13775.84s]  Run away.
[13775.84s -> 13776.24s]  Run away.
[13776.24s -> 13783.30s]  Run away.
[13783.30s -> 13783.94s]  Oh, my God.
[13783.94s -> 13784.90s]  It's so hard to control.
[13785.62s -> 13786.26s]  I want that chair.
[13786.26s -> 13786.98s]  Give it to me.
[13786.98s -> 13788.46s]  Pick it up.
[13788.46s -> 13802.75s]  How do you pick up?
[13806.69s -> 13807.97s]  There's no move list.
[13807.97s -> 13814.61s]  I'm trying to...
[13814.61s -> 13816.69s]  I'm trying every single combination I'm trying.
[13816.69s -> 13817.17s]  I swear.
[13821.70s -> 13823.30s]  I want the chair so bad.
[13823.30s -> 13824.10s]  You have no idea.
[13834.66s -> 13835.06s]  No.
[13835.06s -> 13836.34s]  Pick the chair up.
[13837.30s -> 13838.42s]  Pick the chair up.
[13839.57s -> 13844.83s]  Pick the chair up.
[13844.83s -> 13846.43s]  How do you pick up the chair?
[13862.27s -> 13862.51s]  L?
[13869.98s -> 13882.43s]  I'm pressing L.
[13882.43s -> 13883.23s]  Up on the D-pad.
[13883.23s -> 13883.79s]  D-pad up.
[13894.22s -> 13895.58s]  Get more weapons.
[13895.58s -> 13904.70s]  Ow.
[13904.70s -> 13905.42s]  No, give that to me.
[13906.86s -> 13908.14s]  I'm nothing without my weapon.
[13908.70s -> 13919.36s]  Give me the weapon.
[13919.36s -> 13919.92s]  Give me a weapon.
[13919.92s -> 13921.04s]  I need a weapon.
[13921.04s -> 13922.16s]  Give me a weapon.
[13922.16s -> 13923.68s]  It's an exciting match at least.
[13924.48s -> 13930.82s]  Why is he up immediately?
[13937.23s -> 13937.79s]  Get off me.
[13938.19s -> 13957.79s]  This chair is huge.
[13958.83s -> 13963.25s]  Leave me the fuck alone.
[13964.05s -> 13964.45s]  No.
[13964.45s -> 13969.07s]  Stop it.
[13969.79s -> 13973.81s]  Dude, his ass is insane.
[13974.77s -> 13975.25s]  What do you...
[13975.25s -> 13977.10s]  Oh.
[13978.06s -> 13984.72s]  I need a weapon.
[13984.72s -> 13985.28s]  Please.
[13986.00s -> 13986.48s]  All right.
[13986.48s -> 13989.73s]  I have a guitar.
[13990.45s -> 13990.93s]  Uh-oh.
[13995.12s -> 13995.68s]  Oh, shit.
[13995.68s -> 13996.00s]  Oh, my God.
[13996.00s -> 13996.40s]  Oh, my God.
[13996.40s -> 13996.80s]  Oh, my God.
[13996.80s -> 13997.12s]  Oh, my God.
[13997.12s -> 13997.44s]  Oh, my God.
[13997.44s -> 13997.84s]  Oh, my God.
[13997.84s -> 13998.16s]  Oh, my God.
[13998.16s -> 13998.32s]  Oh, my God.
[13998.32s -> 13998.80s]  Oh, my God.
[13998.80s -> 13999.12s]  I got it.
[13999.12s -> 14000.54s]  I got it.
[14000.54s -> 14000.78s]  I got it.
[14000.78s -> 14001.18s]  I got it.
[14001.18s -> 14001.34s]  I got it.
[14001.34s -> 14001.58s]  I got it.
[14001.58s -> 14001.90s]  I got it.
[14001.90s -> 14002.38s]  Wait.
[14002.38s -> 14006.75s]  Yeah, I can throw this?
[14007.31s -> 14023.01s]  Everybody loves it.
[14023.01s -> 14025.09s]  This is the greatest match they've ever been to.
[14026.13s -> 14031.60s]  Wait.
[14031.76s -> 14032.00s]  Wait.
[14032.00s -> 14032.24s]  Wait.
[14033.84s -> 14034.40s]  Pick it up.
[14035.94s -> 14036.34s]  Ow.
[14040.77s -> 14041.57s]  Oh, I blocked it.
[14071.94s -> 14072.66s]  Give me a weapon.
[14072.66s -> 14073.06s]  Hurry.
[14094.40s -> 14095.28s]  What the hell is this?
[14105.66s -> 14106.62s]  Should I pin him?
[14125.52s -> 14127.52s]  Dude, his health is transparent right now.
[14127.52s -> 14145.82s]  He has no health bar.
[14145.82s -> 14161.95s]  He's out?
[14161.95s -> 14165.07s]  He has, like, a little cut on his forehead.
[14168.40s -> 14169.52s]  Dude, look at this excitement.
[14169.52s -> 14170.56s]  159%.
[14173.20s -> 14194.08s]  Oh, look at this popularity.
[14194.08s -> 14195.04s]  This game is great.
[14195.78s -> 14196.34s]  Yeah.
[14196.34s -> 14197.54s]  I mean, it's not fun.
[14198.10s -> 14200.42s]  It's not very good, but it is at the same time.
[14201.22s -> 14202.50s]  It's actually pretty good.
[14203.22s -> 14210.50s]  Oh, yeah.
[14210.50s -> 14226.10s]  We're in Vegas and we're going to a joint tag team.
[14226.66s -> 14232.46s]  Is that a gun?
[14233.02s -> 14235.20s]  Oh, no.
[14235.20s -> 14235.60s]  Is it?
[14236.90s -> 14237.38s]  No.
[14237.38s -> 14237.86s]  What is it?
[14238.42s -> 14241.15s]  It's a gun.
[14276.62s -> 14283.87s]  Rob Van Dam.
[14283.87s -> 14284.99s]  Bob and Rob.
[14284.99s -> 14305.12s]  Are we going to fight this guy?
[14333.41s -> 14334.21s]  Not this again.
[14334.93s -> 14336.13s]  Wait, I'm cheating.
[14336.13s -> 14338.98s]  Why does it say cheat?
[14348.11s -> 14348.99s]  How do I cheat?
[14348.99s -> 14367.94s]  Holy shit.
[14367.94s -> 14369.06s]  How do I turn?
[14369.06s -> 14404.70s]  Hey.
[14404.70s -> 14407.84s]  Wait, tag.
[14407.84s -> 14408.64s]  Tag in.
[14408.64s -> 14424.06s]  Tag in.
[14424.06s -> 14425.02s]  Oh, shit.
[14425.02s -> 14440.38s]  We're in.
[14440.38s -> 14440.88s]  Uh-oh.
[14454.26s -> 14455.22s]  Pick the weapon up.
[14472.35s -> 14485.15s]  What?
[14485.15s -> 14498.67s]  Oh, I blocked it.
[14498.67s -> 14500.26s]  Tag.
[14500.26s -> 14533.01s]  Tag, you idiot.
[14533.01s -> 14533.41s]  Pin.
[14533.41s -> 14533.91s]  Pin.
[14536.14s -> 14536.64s]  Pin him.
[14543.52s -> 14546.50s]  No, shit.
[14546.50s -> 14555.15s]  Tag in.
[14555.15s -> 14555.55s]  All right.
[14555.55s -> 14556.27s]  Tag in.
[14556.27s -> 14565.78s]  Let's do it.
[14571.33s -> 14573.33s]  He punched his own brother.
[14573.33s -> 14575.01s]  Why can I hit two of them together?
[14575.65s -> 14576.69s]  Why is the rev out?
[14588.38s -> 14588.78s]  All right.
[14588.78s -> 14589.02s]  Pin.
[14589.82s -> 14598.51s]  Turn around and look at this guy.
[14600.38s -> 14601.82s]  Stop looking at the other guy
[14601.82s -> 14603.42s]  and look at the guy fighting in the ring.
[14604.22s -> 14621.70s]  Oh, shit.
[14621.70s -> 14623.02s]  Get him.
[14623.02s -> 14625.98s]  Get him.
[14625.98s -> 14627.02s]  Oh, my God.
[14627.02s -> 14628.46s]  That's a dangerous move.
[14634.58s -> 14634.90s]  All right.
[14634.90s -> 14635.62s]  Get in here.
[14637.14s -> 14637.86s]  And I need to get it.
[14637.86s -> 14639.14s]  I need to pin you.
[14639.14s -> 14651.07s]  His body is lifeless.
[14651.71s -> 14656.51s]  My God.
[14659.78s -> 14660.50s]  Okay.
[14660.50s -> 14660.74s]  Pin.
[14661.38s -> 14662.42s]  What's the pin button?
[14663.14s -> 14674.16s]  Yeah, I could use your help right now.
[14674.88s -> 14675.84s]  No, just take your time.
[14675.84s -> 14676.24s]  Don't worry.
[14676.24s -> 14676.72s]  I got both.
[14687.41s -> 14689.01s]  I pressed every single button.
[14689.57s -> 14699.09s]  What's he doing?
[14704.90s -> 14709.94s]  Pin.
[14709.94s -> 14710.74s]  Oh, my God.
[14710.74s -> 14712.10s]  That was a centimeter.
[14746.78s -> 14748.22s]  No excitement, Andy.
[14776.56s -> 14778.00s]  I tried to tag the partner.
[14778.00s -> 14778.56s]  It didn't work.
[14780.48s -> 14785.02s]  You're going for a no pin run.
[14785.90s -> 14788.75s]  I mean, I'm going for a maybe one more match
[14788.75s -> 14789.55s]  before we move on.
[14790.43s -> 14793.07s]  This is too much in my brain right now.
[14797.76s -> 14799.52s]  It's D-pad plus X.
[14800.16s -> 14805.95s]  There's a QTE on the health bar to cheat.
[14806.59s -> 14826.30s]  Wait, what did I do?
[14826.30s -> 14846.21s]  Oh, it's the iron cheek.
[14846.21s -> 14851.86s]  Okay.
[14851.86s -> 14853.86s]  Why am I against two people?
[14853.86s -> 14873.52s]  Oh, wait, I get it.
[14873.52s -> 14879.76s]  I see what you mean.
[14879.76s -> 14881.20s]  I have to time it.
[14881.20s -> 14882.18s]  I get it.
[14882.18s -> 14896.82s]  How do I do a finishing move?
[14896.82s -> 14912.72s]  How is this not exciting?
[14912.72s -> 14934.53s]  That's never not going to be funny.
[14934.53s -> 14957.70s]  That was sick.
[14957.70s -> 14979.42s]  You need to cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.
[14979.42s -> 14979.90s]  What?
[14979.90s -> 14993.54s]  Of course, I bring out the weapon
[14993.54s -> 14994.50s]  and all of a sudden everybody thinks
[14994.50s -> 14999.18s]  the match is cool again.
[14999.18s -> 14999.82s]  Look at that.
[14999.82s -> 15001.68s]  I brought out the weapon.
[15001.68s -> 15003.36s]  I got 30% excitement meter.
[15004.86s -> 15006.30s]  Dude, you should hit the ref.
[15006.30s -> 15008.22s]  I think I did accidentally.
[15020.48s -> 15025.68s]  Huge power bomb.
[15025.68s -> 15026.16s]  Oh, hold on.
[15026.16s -> 15027.04s]  Grab him.
[15027.04s -> 15037.68s]  Hit him.
[15037.68s -> 15038.48s]  Stop winning.
[15039.20s -> 15055.68s]  You don't get up immediately from that shit.
[15055.68s -> 15056.24s]  Come on, dude.
[15072.45s -> 15073.73s]  Stop reversing that.
[15074.45s -> 15082.37s]  Why do they just cut to that guy?
[15083.17s -> 15085.04s]  All right, I got to get it.
[15085.04s -> 15085.68s]  He's going to get it.
[15085.68s -> 15086.32s]  He's got a weapon.
[15101.86s -> 15102.82s]  You like that dodge?
[15109.46s -> 15110.34s]  Reverse it.
[15110.34s -> 15126.53s]  Hit him.
[15126.53s -> 15127.25s]  Get him.
[15127.25s -> 15133.50s]  How are you doing a one count
[15133.50s -> 15134.38s]  after a move like that?
[15141.84s -> 15161.04s]  Shit, it's got to be it.
[15161.04s -> 15163.12s]  Why are you doing it like that every time?
[15165.78s -> 15167.06s]  Just pin him regular.
[15167.06s -> 15167.86s]  Pin him normally.
[15180.98s -> 15182.42s]  What is going on right now?
[15182.42s -> 15183.06s]  Look at his health.
[15185.41s -> 15185.97s]  I've had enough.
[15216.72s -> 15218.48s]  It's so stupid.
[15218.48s -> 15222.21s]  The ref is speaking Simlish.
[15227.20s -> 15228.24s]  He had to flex.
[15229.12s -> 15251.01s]  Reverse.
[15251.01s -> 15283.31s]  I can't hit him.
[15292.11s -> 15304.99s]  I need to win one by a pin.
[15304.99s -> 15312.32s]  Dude has zero health.
[15312.32s -> 15314.40s]  I just have to knock everybody out.
[15314.40s -> 15318.53s]  Oh my God.
[15323.04s -> 15324.80s]  That was a big excitement match.
[15328.42s -> 15331.47s]  All right, I'm moving on.
[15331.47s -> 15332.51s]  This was too much.
[15332.51s -> 15334.83s]  That was a great one though.
[15334.83s -> 15336.91s]  Two back to back great ones in a row.
[15337.79s -> 15339.63s]  Although I do want to see one thing though.
[15340.43s -> 15343.97s]  I want to see something.
[15344.77s -> 15348.88s]  Okay, versus four way tag team arena.
[15348.88s -> 15349.52s]  Arena.
[15352.51s -> 15354.35s]  I'm just checking to see if there's any other game modes, all right?
[15355.39s -> 15356.59s]  Like four way dance.
[15363.12s -> 15363.92s]  Yeah, I think that's it.
[15367.68s -> 15368.32s]  Very limited.
[15369.54s -> 15370.58s]  There's no Royal Rumble.
[15371.87s -> 15373.47s]  All right, it's time for you to vote.
[15374.11s -> 15380.08s]  Are we playing Obi-Wan or Cold Fear?
[15380.72s -> 15384.35s]  You get to vote.
[15384.35s -> 15385.47s]  Obi-Wan or Cold Fear?
[15386.11s -> 15392.26s]  Please vote.
[15392.26s -> 15395.12s]  I don't know.
[15395.12s -> 15397.60s]  We've been sticking on the Xbox games a little longer.
[15398.16s -> 15400.67s]  There's been some quality stuff here.
[15400.67s -> 15404.19s]  It's going to be close.
[15407.79s -> 15409.95s]  It's 43 to 57.
[15409.95s -> 15411.79s]  This could, I'm going to have to wait for a second.
[15416.93s -> 15419.57s]  Uh, Star Wars fans are losing out here, I think.
[15425.47s -> 15427.07s]  Cold Fear, I think, is running away with it.
[15427.71s -> 15435.14s]  Somebody said Obi-Wan is haha funny.
[15435.70s -> 15437.33s]  Cold Fear is a horror game.
[15438.05s -> 15441.49s]  Well, do you want a haha funny Star Wars game or do you want a horror game?
[15442.13s -> 15442.93s]  It's up to you.
[15448.35s -> 15449.95s]  Uh, looks like it's going to be Cold Fear.
[15457.12s -> 15458.48s]  Okay, now that's it.
[15458.48s -> 15459.92s]  That was close, but that's it.
[15461.22s -> 15462.42s]  45 to 55.
[15462.98s -> 15463.30s]  Close.
[15474.94s -> 15478.72s]  This game's on PC, isn't it?
[15478.72s -> 15481.28s]  One of those games that, I think it's on PC.
[15481.84s -> 15486.85s]  But it doesn't really work.
[15486.85s -> 15488.70s]  I feel like I tried to play this on PC.
[15488.70s -> 15489.58s]  Maybe not.
[15489.58s -> 15489.98s]  Did I?
[15491.02s -> 15491.98s]  Did I play this before?
[15494.83s -> 15495.39s]  Lights off.
[15496.77s -> 15500.78s]  Okay.
[15500.78s -> 15502.69s]  Okay.
[15502.69s -> 15519.26s]  I'll do it.
[15519.26s -> 15522.56s]  That, just auto exposure.
[15523.60s -> 15524.56s]  It got brighter.
[15526.83s -> 15527.23s]  Hold on.
[15542.21s -> 15543.41s]  How did it get brighter?
[15543.41s -> 15550.77s]  Hold on a second.
[15550.77s -> 15568.72s]  It's because I have auto exposure on.
[15568.72s -> 15569.78s]  There we go.
[15569.78s -> 15570.26s]  That's better.
[15570.26s -> 15578.59s]  That's what it actually looks like in here.
[15578.59s -> 15581.78s]  Is this actually scary?
[15581.78s -> 15583.46s]  Or are you just memeing on me?
[15583.46s -> 15591.30s]  All right, let's go.
[15601.12s -> 15603.36s]  Extreme to be what?
[15603.36s -> 15635.66s]  All right, be quiet.
[15635.66s -> 15640.05s]  How do you look like you're in a part of Mexico in a Netflix series?
[15640.05s -> 15660.24s]  You can see how, like, sweaty my face is.
[15660.24s -> 15677.02s]  I'm not getting anything here.
[15678.14s -> 15679.02s]  Marcus.
[15679.02s -> 15679.74s]  Law.
[15679.74s -> 15680.70s]  Can you hear me?
[15680.70s -> 15683.52s]  Somebody, absolutely.
[15683.52s -> 15684.48s]  Is anybody alive?
[15684.48s -> 15690.93s]  I'll get me another asset of their product.
[15690.93s -> 15691.65s]  Anything we've got.
[15692.91s -> 15693.47s]  Anything.
[15693.47s -> 15697.22s]  Does this have tank controls?
[15697.22s -> 15702.21s]  It's a tank control game.
[15702.21s -> 15703.25s]  I'm taking it out of this.
[15703.25s -> 15704.13s]  This is the USS Ravenswood.
[15704.13s -> 15706.21s]  We arrived at the vicinity of the vessel
[15706.21s -> 15708.85s]  and will now initiate a search patrol and look for it.
[15708.85s -> 15709.65s]  Ravenswood out.
[15709.65s -> 15711.25s]  Yes, of course it has tank controls.
[15711.25s -> 15711.97s]  Are you serious?
[15712.21s -> 15714.91s]  This is a granny like?
[15714.91s -> 15716.19s]  I don't think it's a granny like.
[15717.84s -> 15719.04s]  It's tank controls.
[15719.84s -> 15720.48s]  God damn it.
[15720.48s -> 15725.68s]  It's a survival horror game between 1992 and 2003.
[15726.40s -> 15727.12s]  Of course.
[15727.12s -> 15727.92s]  What am I thinking?
[15727.92s -> 15729.76s]  Of course it's going to be a tank control game.
[15729.76s -> 15730.72s]  Am I out of my mind?
[15762.75s -> 15765.23s]  Uh, not tank controls, by the way.
[15766.19s -> 15767.07s]  Not tank controls.
[15769.36s -> 15771.68s]  Already, already much cooler.
[15772.48s -> 15776.91s]  My image running is not suspended thing.
[15777.47s -> 15778.35s]  Combat systems are better.
[15778.35s -> 15780.59s]  They also put their downed hummers
[15780.59s -> 15781.79s]  and potential source of ammo in mid-kits.
[15782.59s -> 15784.99s]  You use the butt of your rifle in close combat systems
[15784.99s -> 15786.43s]  and only do the gain the necessary distance
[15786.43s -> 15787.07s]  to adjust your aim.
[15787.87s -> 15790.00s]  Your opponents will attempt to immobilize you.
[15790.00s -> 15791.68s]  Do not simply empty your foot.
[15791.68s -> 15792.72s]  Drag out of them, refer to yourself,
[15792.72s -> 15793.76s]  and shoot at point blank range.
[15793.76s -> 15794.64s]  This is generally how I respect it.
[15795.28s -> 15795.89s]  Okay.
[15796.53s -> 15798.24s]  All right.
[15798.96s -> 15799.70s]  Okay.
[15808.74s -> 15811.38s]  Legends of wrestling has burnt into the top of the screen
[15811.38s -> 15812.66s]  and it's ruining my immersion.
[15813.46s -> 15832.91s]  How do I run?
[15833.47s -> 15838.37s]  This is actually kind of cool.
[15842.53s -> 15842.85s]  Whoa.
[15843.65s -> 15850.54s]  This is not tank controls.
[15850.54s -> 15852.38s]  This actually seems like it's going to be pretty awesome.
[15853.18s -> 15869.02s]  What am I supposed to do?
[15885.52s -> 15886.40s]  Ammo.
[15886.40s -> 15910.66s]  There's a monster right there.
[15910.66s -> 15920.88s]  I have fully loaded ammo.
[15921.60s -> 15936.13s]  What was the point of coming in here?
[15940.24s -> 15961.23s]  Booth cam top right.
[15966.69s -> 15969.50s]  Um, what am I missing here?
[15970.22s -> 15975.73s]  Find the emergency radio code.
[15976.29s -> 15979.68s]  He should be on the front deck.
[15980.40s -> 15989.15s]  Okay.
[15989.15s -> 15990.19s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[15990.83s -> 15999.89s]  It's burning.
[16001.52s -> 16003.04s]  How do I get to the front of the deck?
[16030.69s -> 16031.01s]  What?
[16031.01s -> 16031.41s]  Where?
[16031.41s -> 16039.63s]  How do I get to the front deck?
[16039.63s -> 16041.39s]  Can I go in a door that I didn't see before?
[16054.51s -> 16055.55s]  It's too quiet now.
[16057.94s -> 16058.90s]  Guys, help me out here.
[16058.90s -> 16061.46s]  I don't understand what this game wants me to do.
[16062.18s -> 16062.98s]  It's right here.
[16063.94s -> 16064.50s]  That door.
[16065.81s -> 16067.17s]  I can't go into this door.
[16072.19s -> 16072.83s]  Go left?
[16072.83s -> 16073.71s]  Off to the side?
[16079.01s -> 16080.05s]  What the fuck is this?
[16084.74s -> 16086.34s]  I did it on purpose, but I had to see.
[16093.79s -> 16094.59s]  I had to do it though.
[16094.59s -> 16098.64s]  You know I had to.
[16098.64s -> 16121.89s]  Now I know where to go.
[16144.83s -> 16145.39s]  Get up there.
[16151.04s -> 16158.62s]  Do I actually have to fall and shimmy?
[16160.38s -> 16162.14s]  I went in a fucking circle.
[16162.14s -> 16163.66s]  You guys told me to do a go here.
[16164.70s -> 16165.26s]  Never mind.
[16165.26s -> 16166.46s]  That's where you started.
[16166.46s -> 16167.50s]  What do you mean never mind?
[16168.06s -> 16169.34s]  What do you mean never mind?
[16169.34s -> 16170.54s]  Everybody told me to go over there.
[16172.77s -> 16173.73s]  Everyone said go.
[16173.73s -> 16174.21s]  Go.
[16174.21s -> 16177.65s]  Oh, yeah, you're not gonna do the troll face and tell me.
[16177.65s -> 16180.13s]  No, you all got that wrong.
[16180.13s -> 16180.69s]  And so did I.
[16182.05s -> 16183.89s]  You all got that completely wrong.
[16183.89s -> 16184.45s]  All of you did.
[16190.94s -> 16191.74s]  Other side?
[16192.62s -> 16206.13s]  You walk past the stairs.
[16210.13s -> 16212.61s]  Yeah, we haven't played this game.
[16212.61s -> 16214.37s]  You guys all told me to go this way.
[16222.53s -> 16227.09s]  Dude, if the front of this fucking boat is this hard to find.
[16227.09s -> 16228.93s]  I'm sorry, but this is stupid.
[16229.89s -> 16231.78s]  You did it again?
[16231.78s -> 16233.46s]  The other side of the...
[16233.46s -> 16234.90s]  Do you want me to link you a walkthrough?
[16236.19s -> 16237.39s]  The left staircase.
[16238.27s -> 16239.82s]  This staircase right here.
[16240.46s -> 16241.34s]  This one right here.
[16243.20s -> 16244.08s]  This one right here.
[16246.45s -> 16247.97s]  Okay, I've been up here before.
[16248.93s -> 16250.82s]  I was already up here.
[16255.07s -> 16257.07s]  It just takes you to the other side of the boat.
[16258.43s -> 16259.55s]  What are you talking about?
[16265.36s -> 16267.04s]  Just go to customer service.
[16267.60s -> 16268.32s]  There's a door.
[16271.89s -> 16272.77s]  Why are you yelling?
[16272.77s -> 16275.89s]  Because it's really loud in my ears and I have to talk really loud to hear myself.
[16276.77s -> 16277.41s]  That door?
[16278.29s -> 16281.81s]  Dude, this door is just a scary jump scare for five seconds.
[16285.81s -> 16295.62s]  Look, nobody knows where I'm supposed to go.
[16296.26s -> 16303.47s]  This is not the front deck.
[16315.71s -> 16322.00s]  Go to the...
[16322.00s -> 16324.00s]  Try the opposite side of the boat from where you started.
[16324.00s -> 16324.56s]  Maybe.
[16324.56s -> 16325.20s]  I don't know.
[16325.20s -> 16325.76s]  This is...
[16325.76s -> 16327.28s]  I don't understand what it wants me to do.
[16328.24s -> 16332.05s]  I've been every single place.
[16332.93s -> 16334.34s]  Go to the poop deck.
[16334.98s -> 16336.42s]  That was actually kind of funny.
[16337.14s -> 16342.37s]  Go to the tip of the boat.
[16343.09s -> 16345.26s]  Believe it or not, you're not in the right area now.
[16345.26s -> 16346.70s]  Go find the area you're supposed to be in.
[16347.42s -> 16348.38s]  Over here?
[16348.38s -> 16349.50s]  Have I looked back here?
[16350.38s -> 16373.04s]  How do I reload?
[16380.64s -> 16383.36s]  I'm sorry, that was impossible.
[16383.36s -> 16387.44s]  I had to accidentally touch every piece of this boat.
[16394.34s -> 16395.78s]  The door is locked by an electrical system.
[16397.92s -> 16399.44s]  Damn thing's locked from the other side.
[16400.24s -> 16402.78s]  Maybe I can shoot this thing.
[16403.42s -> 16413.12s]  It's unlocked.
[16413.12s -> 16413.92s]  Get off!
[16414.88s -> 16417.12s]  Stop!
[16417.12s -> 16417.92s]  Stop it!
[16417.92s -> 16418.32s]  Stop!
[16418.88s -> 16419.36s]  Stop!
[16419.92s -> 16420.40s]  Stop!
[16425.07s -> 16426.11s]  Why are you touching it?
[16443.65s -> 16444.45s]  What are you doing?
[16447.47s -> 16447.79s]  Hey.
[16466.02s -> 16467.46s]  I haven't saved it yet.
[16472.21s -> 16472.53s]  Hey.
[16474.08s -> 16474.88s]  All right.
[16474.88s -> 16477.44s]  Now, I don't remember even where to go from there.
[16478.98s -> 16482.42s]  I can't believe you can get electrocuted by the thing.
[16488.03s -> 16488.27s]  Hey.
[16497.22s -> 16497.86s]  Yeah, yeah.
[16497.86s -> 16498.34s]  I know.
[16498.34s -> 16498.82s]  I know.
[16498.82s -> 16499.22s]  Steady.
[16499.22s -> 16499.78s]  Watch out.
[16499.78s -> 16500.58s]  You can use ammo.
[16500.58s -> 16501.30s]  Put it in your gun.
[16501.30s -> 16501.62s]  Yep.
[16501.62s -> 16502.66s]  Sounds great.
[16502.66s -> 16503.30s]  Excellent.
[16503.30s -> 16504.10s]  I can't wait.
[16506.58s -> 16507.70s]  I'm not going to shoot anything.
[16508.42s -> 16510.50s]  Why would there be this much ammo around here if there's no enemies?
[16511.46s -> 16512.34s]  It's over here.
[16512.34s -> 16513.38s]  Straight ahead.
[16513.46s -> 16520.66s]  The one tiny, teeny, tiny, itsy bitsy, not even the width of a human being.
[16521.54s -> 16522.58s]  This is what I needed to see.
[16523.54s -> 16524.26s]  Look.
[16524.26s -> 16525.94s]  It's not even the width of a human being.
[16525.94s -> 16526.90s]  And this is where I have to go down.
[16536.13s -> 16536.69s]  Who's this?
[16537.25s -> 16537.97s]  Who's this guy?
[16543.87s -> 16544.51s]  What happened?
[16563.30s -> 16565.06s]  Why did that happen?
[16565.06s -> 16571.84s]  He got killed by the waves last time because you took so long.
[16576.43s -> 16577.87s]  You got to be fucking kidding me.
[16592.02s -> 16595.46s]  How do I, how do I do this correctly?
[16617.34s -> 16618.46s]  What are you doing?
[16619.18s -> 16633.90s]  Shut up.
[16634.72s -> 16635.20s]  Shut up.
[16635.20s -> 16635.60s]  Shut it up.
[16648.18s -> 16648.58s]  Save.
[16648.58s -> 16649.22s]  How do you save?
[16664.24s -> 16666.00s]  Now what?
[16666.00s -> 16666.48s]  Okay.
[16666.48s -> 16667.52s]  He should be in the front.
[16667.52s -> 16668.64s]  I got to get to the front deck.
[16669.28s -> 16690.96s]  The tank control games are stupid.
[16690.96s -> 16692.18s]  They're dumb.
[16692.18s -> 16694.14s]  They're dumb.
[16694.14s -> 16698.88s]  I have to say it to you.
[16698.88s -> 16708.61s]  That was, that took me way too long to, oh, okay, good.
[16708.61s -> 16728.83s]  You're a weenie.
[16732.77s -> 16733.49s]  I'm okay with that.
[16753.49s -> 16756.69s]  Yay.
[16756.69s -> 16759.57s]  Hey, hey.
[16759.57s -> 16764.99s]  Ah, what are you doing?
[16764.99s -> 16766.11s]  How am I supposed to see?
[16800.19s -> 16801.39s]  Where's the door?
[16801.39s -> 16807.42s]  It's a scary game now.
[16807.42s -> 16809.52s]  You're being too quiet.
[16809.52s -> 16813.94s]  I'm trying to focus.
[16813.94s -> 16819.02s]  Main deck.
[16819.02s -> 16820.22s]  This door ain't opening.
[16853.42s -> 16854.22s]  Save.
[16854.22s -> 16862.14s]  A note about the armory.
[16862.14s -> 16863.42s]  Smoking is forbidden.
[16863.42s -> 16865.42s]  Okay, so this is where, this is death.
[16865.42s -> 16884.74s]  That was Resident Evil typewriter music, right?
[16884.74s -> 16886.50s]  We need some comedic relief.
[16886.50s -> 16888.53s]  Can you put in a bit more effort, please?
[16889.09s -> 16903.36s]  Electrical boxes.
[16903.36s -> 16904.48s]  Yeah, I know.
[16904.48s -> 16904.96s]  Trust me.
[16904.96s -> 16926.06s]  I, I wish I had that info like 20 minutes ago when I got electrocuted to death.
[16926.06s -> 16926.86s]  It's locked.
[16926.86s -> 16936.74s]  Watch how much I'm using.
[16936.74s -> 16938.34s]  I ain't got an unlimited supply.
[16938.34s -> 16939.62s]  Why would I even take that?
[16939.62s -> 16942.90s]  I thought it was a health pack I could store in my inventory.
[16942.90s -> 16945.34s]  That's not what that was.
[16945.34s -> 16947.42s]  I had full health.
[16947.42s -> 16950.34s]  Have you been, I'm not going to read that.
[16950.34s -> 16974.75s]  A page from the, wait, I ain't reading all that.
[16974.75s -> 16975.71s]  Nevermind.
[16975.71s -> 16981.54s]  I wish I could just turn on, I wish it was a thing like a caveman filter
[16981.54s -> 16986.38s]  where it would just be like, this is like two or three pages of info.
[16986.94s -> 16991.50s]  And I can press like, I can hold start, select and press both the trigger buttons.
[16991.50s -> 16994.26s]  And it'll just give me one sentence.
[16994.26s -> 16996.62s]  Like, electrical box.
[16996.62s -> 16998.06s]  Danger.
[16998.06s -> 16998.38s]  Touch.
[16998.38s -> 16999.89s]  Do not.
[16999.89s -> 17000.13s]  Key.
[17000.77s -> 17002.91s]  Upper hallway.
[17002.91s -> 17004.51s]  Like, hallway 1B.
[17005.15s -> 17005.47s]  All right.
[17005.47s -> 17015.10s]  I just wish it would be, I would, I would pay extra for that.
[17015.10s -> 17017.63s]  Me die from electrical box.
[17017.63s -> 17018.99s]  Me leave key.
[17018.99s -> 17020.27s]  Hallway 1.
[17020.27s -> 17021.23s]  Door 1B.
[17022.35s -> 17023.31s]  Thank you.
[17023.31s -> 17024.11s]  Thank you so much.
[17024.11s -> 17024.91s]  What kind of way of ship is this?
[17024.91s -> 17034.37s]  I'm going to need an electronic key to open this sucker up.
[17034.37s -> 17043.28s]  Shit.
[17043.28s -> 17044.88s]  You need a journalist mode?
[17044.88s -> 17046.24s]  That's not Eve.
[17046.24s -> 17046.88s]  Come on.
[17047.68s -> 17056.37s]  No, I just want like a condensed mode.
[17056.37s -> 17080.70s]  Okay.
[17080.70s -> 17082.86s]  Well, good thing I already killed the zombie.
[17090.96s -> 17092.32s]  I knew it was going to happen.
[17097.50s -> 17097.98s]  Thank God.
[17097.98s -> 17098.62s]  I got the key.
[17101.01s -> 17102.29s]  Can I do something about this?
[17102.93s -> 17104.69s]  What do I do about this?
[17104.69s -> 17112.85s]  Okay.
[17112.85s -> 17113.25s]  Okay.
[17113.25s -> 17113.89s]  All right.
[17113.89s -> 17114.37s]  All right.
[17114.37s -> 17115.09s]  All right.
[17115.09s -> 17120.66s]  I need a handle for this door.
[17120.66s -> 17121.86s]  I have the upper deck key.
[17122.42s -> 17125.97s]  Let me just see if these doors, if any of these doors work after the next electrocution.
[17126.13s -> 17136.99s]  The damn thing's stuck.
[17136.99s -> 17141.33s]  There's too much water pressure.
[17141.33s -> 17141.89s]  I can't.
[17143.89s -> 17144.37s]  Upper deck.
[17145.01s -> 17167.76s]  It's unlocked.
[17167.76s -> 17171.04s]  I need a save point right now.
[17171.04s -> 17175.94s]  I need a save point right now.
[17175.94s -> 17177.30s]  This is really bad.
[17177.30s -> 17211.38s]  Nothing even in here.
[17211.38s -> 17215.01s]  Really?
[17215.01s -> 17234.43s]  This is a stupid idea.
[17234.43s -> 17235.15s]  Shut up.
[17235.15s -> 17236.29s]  Shut up, idiot.
[17267.22s -> 17268.18s]  All right.
[17268.18s -> 17272.77s]  Please raise your hand if in five minutes you could get back to the front of the boat
[17272.77s -> 17273.65s]  where we were.
[17273.65s -> 17276.32s]  Good luck.
[17276.32s -> 17278.77s]  Because I have no, I have no idea.
[17278.85s -> 17297.87s]  Why did he do that?
[17300.83s -> 17304.13s]  Dude, just if you just waited five seconds.
[17308.45s -> 17309.33s]  Okay.
[17309.33s -> 17312.42s]  Should I check this door?
[17312.42s -> 17315.04s]  What was the point of that?
[17315.04s -> 17319.58s]  Front deck.
[17319.58s -> 17321.60s]  I think I made it to the front deck.
[17346.98s -> 17348.10s]  All burned.
[17348.10s -> 17372.35s]  Must be downstairs.
[17372.35s -> 17403.71s]  Where?
[17403.71s -> 17404.59s]  Page from the diary.
[17405.23s -> 17415.87s]  Boy, it doesn't hurt.
[17415.87s -> 17416.43s]  Infection.
[17418.26s -> 17419.54s]  Antidote needed.
[17419.54s -> 17423.15s]  Appreciate it.
[17423.15s -> 17443.07s]  The gun sounds, sounds like they're coming from a different room in the house.
[17445.63s -> 17446.45s]  It sounds like they're...
[17454.62s -> 17465.01s]  The thing's stuck.
[17465.01s -> 17468.51s]  Lansing?
[17468.51s -> 17471.94s]  Man.
[17471.94s -> 17472.66s]  I'll give it to him though.
[17472.66s -> 17473.62s]  This is pretty good.
[17473.62s -> 17481.86s]  This isn't, this ain't bad.
[17481.86s -> 17487.41s]  At least I found the code.
[17487.41s -> 17489.41s]  This isn't...
[17493.52s -> 17494.64s]  Find the radio room.
[17494.64s -> 17495.12s]  Good luck.
[17495.12s -> 17497.49s]  I have no idea.
[17497.49s -> 17500.05s]  Actually, I'm probably going to actually ask somebody to look that up.
[17500.05s -> 17502.61s]  And because this is, how am I ever going to find that from here?
[17562.96s -> 17573.54s]  Yeah, I'd like to save.
[17573.54s -> 17574.58s]  Weird pop-up.
[17574.58s -> 17583.36s]  But who am I, who's playing as who?
[17583.36s -> 17584.32s]  Oh, it's me.
[17584.32s -> 17584.82s]  Wait.
[17604.90s -> 17606.42s]  Oh, get out.
[17613.52s -> 17614.56s]  Where's the radio room?
[17615.73s -> 17619.81s]  Wait, the radio room is the first room at the very, the beginning of the entire thing, isn't it?
[17620.53s -> 17622.29s]  That's the radio room, isn't it?
[17623.01s -> 17626.05s]  That would be correct.
[17627.33s -> 17639.51s]  Yeah, I would imagine, right?
[17639.51s -> 17639.99s]  It has to be.
[17640.71s -> 17665.64s]  This game's...
[17666.66s -> 17667.70s]  I don't, I don't hate it.
[17668.42s -> 17671.83s]  It's fun.
[17673.72s -> 17674.76s]  It's fun enough.
[17674.76s -> 17685.14s]  I just wanted to see if those things actually explode.
[17685.14s -> 17701.91s]  Okay, this is where we have fun trying to go all the way back to the very beginning of the game.
[17701.91s -> 17707.35s]  To make the ship roll realistically, the developers had to write a completely new program
[17707.35s -> 17712.23s]  dubbed the Darkwave Editor to allow them to control movement on both vertical and horizontal axes.
[17712.95s -> 17716.95s]  They also used real physics to simulate the movement patterns of inanimate objects on the ship.
[17716.95s -> 17721.03s]  Through the random nature created by this, the player character required nine times
[17721.03s -> 17723.83s]  the amount of animations usually seen in third-person games.
[17724.39s -> 17727.75s]  Ultimately, the game contained more than nine hundred...
[17729.03s -> 17729.99s]  What else?
[17730.23s -> 17730.63s]  It's cool.
[17733.11s -> 17733.91s]  This is a good game.
[17734.55s -> 17735.83s]  Look, this came out...
[17735.83s -> 17738.76s]  I don't even know when, but like, this is cool.
[17740.28s -> 17741.56s]  Look at the swaying back and forth.
[17745.89s -> 17746.61s]  That's really cool.
[17753.46s -> 17761.80s]  Hey, we've played at least one other game in this genre of survival horror like this.
[17761.80s -> 17763.80s]  This is the only one that I wouldn't eat.
[17763.80s -> 17780.80s]  What's that supposed to mean?
[17780.80s -> 17781.68s]  I don't know.
[17781.68s -> 17787.33s]  It's the only one I would keep around.
[17787.33s -> 17791.01s]  I would eat the other ones, but no, I wouldn't eat the other ones.
[17791.09s -> 17796.80s]  It's just the only one that I wouldn't break.
[17798.80s -> 17799.20s]  I don't know.
[17799.84s -> 17800.96s]  I thought eat was a different...
[17800.96s -> 17805.04s]  was like a cooler way to say like throw away or like break.
[17805.76s -> 17818.12s]  No, we got to know who that is.
[17818.76s -> 17831.35s]  Damn.
[17831.35s -> 17835.06s]  What's this?
[17835.06s -> 17836.42s]  It looks like this will do the job.
[17837.06s -> 17845.83s]  Handwheel for the fish hold door.
[17845.83s -> 17846.87s]  Ooh, that was a health pack.
[17847.43s -> 17855.28s]  Dude, you're not beating the you're not human allegations.
[17864.50s -> 17865.88s]  Is he dead?
[17869.33s -> 17870.29s]  What the fuck?
[17874.05s -> 17889.88s]  I have to shoot their heads.
[17890.60s -> 17896.24s]  See, I told you I'm gonna ammo.
[17896.24s -> 17903.12s]  Thank God.
[17909.46s -> 17912.68s]  It's actually scary.
[17912.68s -> 17916.13s]  Where do I go from here?
[17916.13s -> 17918.61s]  I got, I got, we can turn around.
[17918.61s -> 17927.59s]  I can't.
[17927.59s -> 17927.91s]  All right.
[17927.91s -> 17928.95s]  Well, sorry.
[17928.95s -> 17933.91s]  How do I get out of here?
[17957.38s -> 17958.66s]  Holy shit.
[17958.66s -> 17963.76s]  You got to find the fish stick door.
[17963.76s -> 17968.80s]  You're so greasy.
[17968.80s -> 17970.48s]  Sound is so decent.
[17970.48s -> 17971.20s]  Is it?
[17971.20s -> 17978.04s]  Is it what did nobody tell me for like the last five hours?
[17978.44s -> 17982.24s]  No, it's not.
[17982.24s -> 17982.96s]  Not at all.
[17982.96s -> 17985.80s]  It's fine.
[17985.80s -> 17986.20s]  It's fine.
[17986.20s -> 17986.84s]  No, it's fine.
[17986.84s -> 17988.20s]  It's fine.
[17988.20s -> 17990.40s]  Sounds fine.
[17990.40s -> 17991.44s]  It's a stream.
[17991.44s -> 17997.09s]  Oh, I mean, yeah, I'm going to get like a little moisture all over my face.
[17997.09s -> 17998.05s]  I'm sitting here.
[17998.05s -> 18000.37s]  I've got an Xbox sauna in the room.
[18000.37s -> 18007.97s]  I've got a GTX 3090 going at firing at all cylinders.
[18007.97s -> 18011.89s]  I've got three monitors blaring light into my face.
[18011.89s -> 18015.89s]  I have a ring light up here blaring sauna like heat into my face.
[18016.45s -> 18020.45s]  You have a 3090?
[18020.45s -> 18020.93s]  Yes, I do.
[18021.49s -> 18028.77s]  All right.
[18028.77s -> 18029.73s]  How do I get out of here?
[18037.06s -> 18037.94s]  Oh, I remember this.
[18039.80s -> 18040.44s]  This part.
[18040.44s -> 18041.40s]  And then I'm close.
[18043.81s -> 18044.69s]  I'm really close.
[18051.84s -> 18053.44s]  Privileged streamer.
[18053.44s -> 18055.04s]  Oh, do not be mistaken.
[18055.04s -> 18056.08s]  I am a moron.
[18056.72s -> 18057.36s]  It sucked.
[18057.92s -> 18059.36s]  I didn't want this.
[18059.36s -> 18060.96s]  I did not want this card.
[18062.72s -> 18068.96s]  I paid so such a stupid price for this because there were no graphics cards.
[18068.96s -> 18069.76s]  There were none.
[18070.92s -> 18073.88s]  Do you remember a few years ago, two or two years ago?
[18074.60s -> 18079.72s]  They were bots just waiting and anytime like a 3080 or like a 3070 came up,
[18080.52s -> 18083.16s]  there was whole websites, there were whole discords and bots
[18083.16s -> 18085.40s]  dedicated to scooping them up at the second they were available.
[18086.28s -> 18092.12s]  I found one 3090 for a stupid price and I was like, I hate myself for doing this.
[18092.12s -> 18095.08s]  But I waited like probably four or five, six months.
[18095.08s -> 18096.68s]  I was like, what the fuck, man?
[18098.28s -> 18100.60s]  I want a new computer and I want a new graphics card.
[18101.32s -> 18102.80s]  I really didn't want to do it.
[18106.96s -> 18108.40s]  This door ain't opening.
[18108.40s -> 18109.52s]  You look like a wax model.
[18110.24s -> 18117.70s]  I wanted a 3090.
[18117.70s -> 18120.42s]  No, a 3080, but it just was never going to happen.
[18121.22s -> 18123.94s]  And I didn't want a 3070 because I got streaming.
[18123.94s -> 18126.34s]  It was like, I want to stream and be able to play games of good quality
[18126.34s -> 18127.14s]  and stream it and stuff.
[18127.14s -> 18127.86s]  So I was like, whatever.
[18131.19s -> 18131.43s]  Okay.
[18131.43s -> 18132.47s]  Where do I need to go from here?
[18134.32s -> 18135.52s]  It's back this way, isn't it?
[18136.50s -> 18136.74s]  Yeah.
[18138.32s -> 18139.68s]  And then where?
[18139.68s -> 18139.92s]  Here?
[18145.92s -> 18146.96s]  Where's the way out of here?
[18150.79s -> 18151.43s]  Is it this one?
[18152.15s -> 18156.28s]  No.
[18156.28s -> 18156.52s]  Okay.
[18156.52s -> 18157.64s]  This is the armory.
[18158.28s -> 18164.12s]  What was the price?
[18164.92s -> 18167.24s]  I don't remember, but it was, it had,
[18167.24s -> 18169.80s]  it was definitely more than a couple thousand dollars.
[18171.84s -> 18174.56s]  It was, it was, it was, it was, it was just like,
[18174.56s -> 18176.88s]  this is just her stomach ache thinking about it.
[18178.47s -> 18179.27s]  It was a stomach ache.
[18179.27s -> 18181.19s]  I got a stomach ache looking at it.
[18185.14s -> 18186.18s]  It was so bad.
[18187.22s -> 18194.98s]  I ended up getting a 3060 TI for two and a half times retail.
[18195.78s -> 18202.72s]  Can somebody help me here?
[18203.28s -> 18206.60s]  What brand of 3090?
[18206.60s -> 18212.39s]  I actually EVGA, maybe.
[18213.11s -> 18216.74s]  Then can somebody help me go down the stairs?
[18216.74s -> 18217.06s]  Thank you.
[18217.78s -> 18234.40s]  This is with the electricities down here.
[18234.96s -> 18237.92s]  It's unlocked.
[18237.92s -> 18238.96s]  Oh, shit.
[18238.96s -> 18239.60s]  Okay.
[18239.60s -> 18248.56s]  They stopped making Nvidia cards.
[18248.56s -> 18248.80s]  Yeah.
[18248.80s -> 18255.94s]  I mean, I, who even makes good graphics cards now?
[18255.94s -> 18258.10s]  You don't play games that require 3090.
[18258.66s -> 18261.22s]  Have a streaming requires a very powerful machine,
[18261.22s -> 18262.74s]  especially if you're going to do the GPU rendering.
[18276.80s -> 18277.60s]  Swag.
[18288.36s -> 18300.55s]  Ooh, boy.
[18301.11s -> 18302.39s]  Son of a bitch.
[18302.39s -> 18315.57s]  He's still alive.
[18315.57s -> 18347.27s]  That it?
[18347.83s -> 18366.23s]  But yeah, I don't, I typically do graphics cards every,
[18367.68s -> 18374.72s]  I want to say I usually wait at least two or three generations.
[18374.72s -> 18376.77s]  So if I have a 3090,
[18376.77s -> 18379.65s]  I'm probably going to wait for at least like the 6000,
[18379.65s -> 18384.05s]  like the 6090 or whatever, a 6080.
[18384.05s -> 18387.35s]  I usually wait two or three generations.
[18387.35s -> 18392.48s]  Before the 3090, I had a 1080.
[18392.48s -> 18393.20s]  So what's that?
[18393.20s -> 18396.29s]  Two, two generations, three, maybe.
[18396.29s -> 18399.12s]  Took a while for the 30 series to come out, didn't it?
[18399.12s -> 18402.24s]  The damn thing stuck.
[18402.24s -> 18403.44s]  What am I missing in here?
[18403.52s -> 18404.98s]  It's a latch.
[18404.98s -> 18409.80s]  And let me be really honest.
[18409.80s -> 18413.56s]  That 1080 lasted an incredibly long time.
[18413.56s -> 18417.19s]  And do I have permission to swag out?
[18417.19s -> 18426.15s]  Yeah, you don't have to wait.
[18426.15s -> 18430.87s]  I don't, I don't want to just buy shit just to buy it.
[18430.87s -> 18434.16s]  I'd rather just get what I pay for and use it
[18434.16s -> 18435.68s]  and get the best out of it whenever I can.
[18437.46s -> 18439.30s]  I don't buy a new phone every year.
[18441.25s -> 18446.72s]  That's kind of, I feel like that's an overkill.
[18446.72s -> 18449.28s]  I buy a new graphics card when I buy a new phone.
[18449.28s -> 18452.40s]  The damn thing stuck.
[18452.40s -> 18454.64s]  They happen at the same time.
[18454.96s -> 18466.12s]  So what am I, what?
[18466.12s -> 18467.56s]  Is it an item I didn't get?
[18467.56s -> 18471.92s]  Who buys a phone every year?
[18471.92s -> 18477.35s]  Didn't I get a fish key?
[18478.15s -> 18479.67s]  How come I can't use it here?
[18479.67s -> 18489.44s]  You got the radio room key.
[18489.44s -> 18490.56s]  I got a fish thing though.
[18490.56s -> 18494.72s]  It said like the fish thing.
[18494.72s -> 18495.52s]  Didn't it say that?
[18506.40s -> 18506.80s]  No.
[18506.80s -> 18507.92s]  So what's the point of coming down here?
[18507.92s -> 18509.60s]  Just to get scared and then leave?
[18509.60s -> 18514.53s]  Yeah, I don't need new phones.
[18514.53s -> 18515.89s]  I like the stuff that I have.
[18515.89s -> 18518.08s]  And I get, and then I, I don't know.
[18518.08s -> 18519.76s]  Cause then here's another thing, right?
[18519.76s -> 18521.84s]  You buy a phone every single year.
[18521.84s -> 18524.82s]  You're just going to have like a bunch of fucking phones.
[18524.82s -> 18525.62s]  And then what?
[18525.70s -> 18528.34s]  I mean, you can try to use one of those recycling programs.
[18529.68s -> 18530.16s]  I don't know.
[18530.16s -> 18532.64s]  I just, I don't want, I don't just don't want it.
[18534.34s -> 18535.54s]  I mean, you could just turn them in.
[18536.18s -> 18539.06s]  But I don't want a new, because when you get a new phone,
[18540.53s -> 18542.37s]  think about what happens when you get a new phone.
[18545.89s -> 18547.49s]  When you get a new phone, it's like you have to re,
[18547.49s -> 18548.85s]  your whole life has to reset.
[18550.24s -> 18552.64s]  Like you got to get all the applications
[18552.64s -> 18554.56s]  and you got to get all your contacts.
[18554.56s -> 18556.00s]  You got to, hey, you got to do this.
[18556.00s -> 18556.48s]  You got to do that.
[18556.48s -> 18557.92s]  You got to update this.
[18557.92s -> 18558.88s]  No, I don't want it.
[18558.88s -> 18559.60s]  I don't know.
[18559.60s -> 18561.44s]  I have, but I have works and it's fine.
[18561.44s -> 18562.08s]  It's up to date.
[18562.80s -> 18567.12s]  All right.
[18567.12s -> 18567.84s]  Where do I go from here?
[18568.40s -> 18584.96s]  Can you help just transfer your shit?
[18584.96s -> 18587.04s]  But I don't want a new phone every year.
[18587.04s -> 18588.56s]  They don't change very much.
[18589.89s -> 18591.25s]  I don't need new shit.
[18591.89s -> 18592.53s]  I, okay.
[18592.53s -> 18594.85s]  If you have like an iPhone, if you have an iPhone,
[18595.73s -> 18597.97s]  let's just say like an iPhone 12 right now,
[18598.61s -> 18600.85s]  right now, like you have an iPhone 12 or an iPhone, like 13.
[18601.41s -> 18605.76s]  What is going to happen next year where you,
[18605.76s -> 18607.44s]  you need to upgrade it?
[18608.08s -> 18610.60s]  What's a, when you go on Twitter,
[18611.16s -> 18612.44s]  when you're on Snapchat,
[18612.44s -> 18614.68s]  like the filter loads 0.2 seconds faster.
[18614.68s -> 18615.00s]  What is it?
[18615.00s -> 18615.80s]  What's the need for it?
[18616.82s -> 18617.54s]  USB-C.
[18620.32s -> 18622.32s]  I'm telling you, two or three years,
[18622.32s -> 18625.52s]  you'll get some new, there'll be some new development
[18625.52s -> 18626.56s]  to make it worthwhile.
[18627.54s -> 18629.94s]  You're just getting, it's like buying Madden every year.
[18631.51s -> 18635.43s]  It's like Madden 2021, 22, 23, 24.
[18635.43s -> 18637.51s]  You know, I just buy Madden 20 fucking 20
[18637.51s -> 18638.71s]  and I just update the rosters.
[18642.29s -> 18644.37s]  I don't, I don't need a new Madden.
[18646.64s -> 18648.08s]  Or I go into the character creator
[18648.08s -> 18649.92s]  and I just make the motherfuckers myself.
[18651.14s -> 18655.94s]  You know how long I played MVP baseball like 2004, 2005?
[18656.58s -> 18659.30s]  And I just made every single fucking major league
[18659.30s -> 18660.58s]  baseball player, I didn't care.
[18660.58s -> 18661.46s]  You can just replace them.
[18662.10s -> 18665.68s]  It takes a little bit of work, but it's worth it.
[18665.68s -> 18668.96s]  It's an iPhone rant.
[18669.52s -> 18671.52s]  No, no, I like phones.
[18672.32s -> 18674.88s]  Oh, wow, the Galaxy, like super cool, cool.
[18674.88s -> 18675.92s]  That's fucking cool.
[18675.92s -> 18679.70s]  But you don't need one every single year.
[18679.78s -> 18684.66s]  You know, you get a Galaxy, a Galaxy phone, sick.
[18684.66s -> 18687.30s]  That's fucking awesome.
[18687.30s -> 18690.18s]  You're going to get the Galaxy phone seven months later.
[18690.18s -> 18692.31s]  You already have the Galaxy 2.
[18692.31s -> 18693.19s]  You need the Galaxy 3.
[18693.19s -> 18694.95s]  You're already on a different goddamn,
[18694.95s -> 18696.79s]  you're in a goddamn nebula at that point.
[18696.79s -> 18698.23s]  You need another Galaxy.
[18698.79s -> 18699.91s]  It's the, you already have the 2.
[18699.91s -> 18700.87s]  You don't need the 3.
[18700.87s -> 18702.96s]  What does the 3 give you, the 2 that you're still,
[18702.96s -> 18704.16s]  you're in outer space already.
[18704.16s -> 18709.32s]  Somebody tell me where to go.
[18714.56s -> 18716.53s]  Somebody tell me what, like door to open?
[18720.93s -> 18723.09s]  Go down the hall, electrocution door is on the right.
[18728.00s -> 18728.72s]  I can hear it.
[18729.20s -> 18737.28s]  Where is it?
[18737.84s -> 18745.86s]  Am I going the right way?
[18747.43s -> 18749.03s]  Yeah, the right is the crew quarters.
[18749.03s -> 18749.83s]  Just use a guide.
[18751.03s -> 18754.63s]  This is the right way.
[18754.63s -> 18755.51s]  It's right through here, right?
[18757.27s -> 18757.91s]  It's right through here.
[18765.04s -> 18766.32s]  Yeah, no, it's not right.
[18768.74s -> 18769.86s]  I hate backtracking.
[18769.86s -> 18771.94s]  I just want, just go forward.
[18771.94s -> 18773.14s]  Or I need a map.
[18773.14s -> 18774.42s]  If there's backtracking, I need a map.
[18776.82s -> 18777.70s]  You're cheating already.
[18783.99s -> 18785.83s]  I feel like I'm so close, but so far away.
[18790.18s -> 18791.70s]  They just spawn randomly.
[18791.70s -> 18793.30s]  It's randomly generated spawns.
[18793.94s -> 18796.84s]  I just did not expect anybody to be right here.
[18802.42s -> 18803.22s]  Next game.
[18803.22s -> 18803.62s]  All right.
[18803.62s -> 18806.42s]  But I need to at least complete this part.
[18807.06s -> 18808.82s]  Draw your own map.
[18808.82s -> 18809.22s]  I can't.
[18809.86s -> 18814.47s]  From where I'm standing right now, where do I go?
[18814.47s -> 18815.65s]  Just help me.
[18816.61s -> 18825.88s]  I know you guys can help me.
[18825.88s -> 18827.32s]  Do whatever you want.
[18827.32s -> 18827.56s]  Up.
[18829.57s -> 18831.25s]  That was like a Twitch staff member.
[18831.25s -> 18832.37s]  So I'm going to listen to that.
[18833.01s -> 18833.73s]  Back and up.
[18834.45s -> 18842.40s]  How do I go up?
[18842.40s -> 18851.46s]  Just be yourself, little guy.
[18856.93s -> 18859.28s]  How do I get out of here?
[18859.28s -> 18859.68s]  Just help.
[18864.40s -> 18865.20s]  I'm playing Obi-Wan.
[18866.08s -> 18866.72s]  I'm playing Obi-Wan.
[18866.72s -> 18867.52s]  This is why I need a map.
[18867.52s -> 18868.24s]  Just give me a map.
[18868.88s -> 18869.92s]  Just give me a map.
[18869.92s -> 18871.36s]  Backtracking sucks without a map.
[18872.08s -> 18880.00s]  Hog, I made it up.
[18881.60s -> 18883.20s]  Literally nobody's played this game.
[18883.20s -> 18884.32s]  We can't help you.
[18887.00s -> 18889.40s]  Fuck, I just want to complete this one mission.
[18889.40s -> 18892.60s]  So I can say I got through chapter one of Cold Fear, at least.
[18893.40s -> 18894.60s]  How do I get out of here?
[18901.78s -> 18905.30s]  No, it's one of these seven or eight doors.
[18907.41s -> 18913.72s]  I have to take the disc out.
[18913.72s -> 18914.84s]  It's not this door.
[18915.56s -> 18919.33s]  Please, did you try the far left door?
[18919.97s -> 18934.24s]  This one, it's right here.
[18934.24s -> 18935.60s]  It's right here.
[18935.60s -> 18937.28s]  I remember we walked over here and I was like, oh, cool.
[18937.28s -> 18938.80s]  What the fuck?
[18938.80s -> 18940.71s]  Other left.
[18940.71s -> 18941.59s]  It's right here.
[18942.15s -> 18942.95s]  Don't give up.
[18942.95s -> 18944.47s]  My cat would be disappointed in you.
[18945.35s -> 18945.75s]  Fuck.
[18946.31s -> 18947.80s]  It's not that one.
[18947.80s -> 18948.60s]  It's not that one.
[18949.88s -> 18950.68s]  It's not this one.
[18950.68s -> 18951.40s]  This one doesn't open.
[18951.40s -> 18952.20s]  It's not this one.
[18954.05s -> 18956.53s]  So what door is it to get out of here?
[18957.17s -> 18958.39s]  Stop yelling at people.
[18966.40s -> 18967.44s]  It's that one.
[18968.16s -> 18979.83s]  Okay, I didn't have any guns.
[18980.39s -> 18989.00s]  Okay, I'm almost there.
[18989.56s -> 18992.02s]  And then after I turn this in, I'm going to play Obi-Wan.
[18992.02s -> 19007.24s]  Can we have a break?
[19007.80s -> 19013.22s]  You'll have a break in the time it takes me to take Obi-Wan out of its case
[19013.22s -> 19014.50s]  and put it into the disk tray.
[19014.50s -> 19016.02s]  It's about five minutes.
[19016.02s -> 19018.72s]  Why am I going back down?
[19018.72s -> 19030.08s]  What's happening now?
[19037.84s -> 19043.36s]  Why would it take you five minutes?
[19043.36s -> 19043.84s]  Time it.
[19044.40s -> 19069.91s]  You don't have a fucking head.
[19069.91s -> 19070.79s]  You can't do that.
[19071.35s -> 19075.67s]  I've been really on edge tonight.
[19075.67s -> 19108.98s]  I can't wait till we get to here.
[19111.46s -> 19112.42s]  This looks like a radio.
[19117.44s -> 19120.00s]  Apollo 7, Niner.
[19120.00s -> 19120.56s]  Can you hear me?
[19121.20s -> 19122.40s]  Who am I speaking to?
[19122.40s -> 19124.71s]  This thing's dead.
[19124.71s -> 19125.67s]  This is Hanson.
[19125.67s -> 19126.55s]  Everyone else is down.
[19127.75s -> 19128.39s]  Bloody hell.
[19129.03s -> 19131.44s]  Then I guess we're stuck with each other, Hanson,
[19131.44s -> 19132.96s]  but you're not the only survivor.
[19133.68s -> 19136.16s]  There's still a very dangerous man loose on that ship.
[19136.16s -> 19137.44s]  Colonel Dmitry Yusupov.
[19138.39s -> 19139.99s]  He needs to answer a few questions.
[19140.71s -> 19142.63s]  Round him up, and then we'll get you out of there.
[19143.43s -> 19144.07s]  Who's we?
[19144.95s -> 19145.45s]  Babe.
[19159.00s -> 19159.50s]  Okay.
[19161.08s -> 19162.92s]  Find that person.
[19165.14s -> 19165.64s]  Got it.
[19175.88s -> 19182.44s]  Why did they just turn me?
[19183.40s -> 19185.46s]  Wait, where am I?
[19190.24s -> 19191.36s]  All right, that was fun.
[19191.36s -> 19192.72s]  That was cold fear.
[19194.08s -> 19198.90s]  It is apparently January 15th, 2001,
[19198.90s -> 19203.30s]  and it's somehow this clock is wrong,
[19203.30s -> 19205.14s]  but not by very much, which is weird.
[19206.39s -> 19207.75s]  It's 2001.
[19211.76s -> 19213.20s]  I'm not alive yet.
[19216.13s -> 19216.63s]  What?
[19221.03s -> 19223.03s]  Pog, I'm not even alive yet.
[19229.19s -> 19229.99s]  All right, that was fun.
[19229.99s -> 19230.79s]  It's time for Obi-Wan.
[19231.75s -> 19233.11s]  I would rate this one.
[19233.11s -> 19235.59s]  I'd give this like a B plus on the tier list.
[19235.59s -> 19236.15s]  It was like a B.
[19236.71s -> 19238.84s]  I think there was some fun.
[19238.84s -> 19239.32s]  That was great.
[19240.48s -> 19243.28s]  Okay, so how long does it take to put a disc in and to load it up?
[19243.28s -> 19243.60s]  Here we go.
[19243.60s -> 19244.90s]  You ready?
[19244.90s -> 19248.23s]  Start timing right now.
[19248.23s -> 19251.89s]  Opening tray.
[19251.89s -> 19256.92s]  Grabbing Obi-Wan.
[19257.56s -> 19258.76s]  Opening Obi-Wan.
[19258.76s -> 19262.18s]  Taking Obi-Wan out of that.
[19262.18s -> 19265.38s]  If that was bionicle, I am going to be furious with you.
[19265.38s -> 19271.41s]  It wasn't.
[19271.41s -> 19279.44s]  Okay, remove about 15 seconds because of that.
[19279.44s -> 19283.62s]  Open going in.
[19283.62s -> 19288.84s]  Something wrong.
[19288.84s -> 19292.53s]  Obi-Wan going in.
[19293.09s -> 19299.88s]  Okay, very cool.
[19300.44s -> 19306.10s]  Opening it.
[19309.30s -> 19312.77s]  It's not ready yet.
[19312.77s -> 19314.05s]  It's not ready yet.
[19314.05s -> 19316.00s]  It's been like a minute.
[19316.00s -> 19316.88s]  It's no, it hasn't.
[19318.00s -> 19318.88s]  We're not ready yet.
[19318.88s -> 19334.63s]  That was cute.
[19334.63s -> 19340.68s]  It's been over a minute.
[19340.68s -> 19341.32s]  It's we're not.
[19341.32s -> 19342.28s]  I'm okay.
[19343.38s -> 19346.50s]  Now, how long has it been since I did that?
[19346.50s -> 19347.14s]  Two, three minutes?
[19347.78s -> 19363.54s]  Jedi one.
[19364.82s -> 19380.66s]  Is there German noises?
[19380.66s -> 19381.14s]  What do you mean?
[19385.81s -> 19386.45s]  No, they're not.
[19387.17s -> 19405.80s]  How about, I'm so bad at making real names.
[19409.17s -> 19415.44s]  Darth, Darth Vader Jr.
[19418.72s -> 19419.28s]  I hate it.
[19419.84s -> 19422.13s]  Wait, aren't I playing as Obi-Wan?
[19426.56s -> 19427.28s]  Why would I need?
[19427.28s -> 19428.48s]  Why wouldn't I just be Obi-Wan?
[19433.56s -> 19434.68s]  This doesn't matter.
[19434.68s -> 19443.83s]  No, that's lame.
[19458.36s -> 19462.31s]  All right, here we go.
[19478.26s -> 19479.78s]  Real FMV cutscene.
[19479.78s -> 19484.00s]  Are we going to get a beep?
[19484.00s -> 19484.64s]  Yes, we are.
[19490.60s -> 19506.92s]  Obi-Wan, for thousands of years,
[19507.64s -> 19513.56s]  the Jedi Knights have served the Republic as defenders of peace
[19514.52s -> 19515.40s]  and justice throughout-
[19515.40s -> 19517.00s]  A little bit faster on the prompter, please.
[19517.00s -> 19517.72s]  The galaxy.
[19521.12s -> 19523.12s]  Young Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi,
[19523.68s -> 19527.52s]  who studies to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight,
[19528.34s -> 19530.74s]  must prove himself to his master,
[19531.38s -> 19532.18s]  Qui-Gon Jinn,
[19532.98s -> 19534.02s]  and the Jedi Council.
[19537.94s -> 19545.06s]  As part of his ongoing training,
[19545.06s -> 19549.78s]  Obi-Wan is commissioned by Maze
[19549.78s -> 19552.58s]  when due to investigate the rise of a dangerous new threat
[19552.58s -> 19554.42s]  in the lower levels of Kurosan.
[19555.22s -> 19563.78s]  Hover over that X.
[19563.78s -> 19564.66s]  Hover over that X.
[19564.66s -> 19565.86s]  I know, I saw you do it.
[19566.50s -> 19567.62s]  You didn't click it, though.
[19567.62s -> 19568.74s]  Some of you did.
[19568.74s -> 19572.39s]  Some of you were just like,
[19572.39s -> 19574.39s]  I want to see this stupid fucking Star Wars game,
[19574.39s -> 19577.67s]  but I wish you would stop talking.
[19577.67s -> 19578.55s]  I got you, don't worry.
[19578.55s -> 19582.61s]  Everything has been quiet, Master.
[19582.61s -> 19584.21s]  Nothing unusual to report.
[19584.21s -> 19586.37s]  Are you sure my presence here is necessary?
[19587.33s -> 19602.23s]  Yes, Master.
[19602.23s -> 19604.39s]  There is an Elkhart transport station nearby.
[19608.55s -> 19609.75s]  Why are you holding him?
[19609.75s -> 19609.99s]  What?
[19610.95s -> 19613.14s]  I thought, aren't we like Batman?
[19613.14s -> 19615.14s]  We don't use the powers unless it's necessary?
[19616.18s -> 19616.42s]  What?
[19620.26s -> 19621.22s]  Why am I doing this?
[19622.48s -> 19623.60s]  He's screaming help.
[19630.02s -> 19641.68s]  That guy's got a golf club.
[19641.68s -> 19642.96s]  Why would you even come over here?
[19666.24s -> 19668.31s]  What's the mission?
[19678.76s -> 19679.88s]  What am I doing?
[19681.56s -> 19683.36s]  What is he doing?
[19683.36s -> 19684.24s]  Wait, what is it?
[19684.24s -> 19685.12s]  Why can you do this?
[19685.92s -> 19686.88s]  Why can I do this?
[19687.76s -> 19688.80s]  I missed everything.
[19688.80s -> 19690.56s]  It was just like, oh, I'll be one.
[19691.60s -> 19693.60s]  Go over this way, and that's all I heard.
[19694.64s -> 19700.02s]  I only have four attempts remaining.
[19700.02s -> 19712.84s]  I don't know what just happened.
[19712.84s -> 19714.20s]  You're supposed to be the good guy.
[19714.20s -> 19715.16s]  Well, what happened?
[19716.20s -> 19717.00s]  We need to see that again.
[19717.00s -> 19721.32s]  I need to fully focus on what's happening.
[19721.32s -> 19721.82s]  Okay.
[19725.57s -> 19725.97s]  Look out.
[19725.97s -> 19726.29s]  Okay.
[19726.29s -> 19727.17s]  So what if I just don't?
[19733.75s -> 19735.19s]  Okay, that's enough.
[19746.18s -> 19747.46s]  I didn't want to kill that guy.
[19751.68s -> 19756.12s]  I think I was doing the right thing.
[19756.12s -> 19756.92s]  I just jumped.
[19770.68s -> 19772.60s]  This game is fucking pretty good.
[19772.60s -> 19773.48s]  This game is good.
[19791.17s -> 19793.49s]  I'm back to defend the order.
[19809.80s -> 19811.24s]  You ever see people do that shit?
[19811.88s -> 19812.84s]  I've seen videos.
[19812.84s -> 19815.00s]  If it's like, oh, look at somebody doing back handsprings.
[19815.56s -> 19816.20s]  This many.
[19819.59s -> 19820.31s]  Don't you?
[19820.31s -> 19820.95s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[19820.95s -> 19821.99s]  Like during like a musical,
[19821.99s -> 19824.07s]  they'll just kind of go across the screen.
[19824.07s -> 19825.75s]  It's like, doesn't that make you feel sick?
[19826.63s -> 19829.70s]  I would feel so awful after that.
[19833.51s -> 19836.23s]  You have to, you can only backflip only run.
[19836.95s -> 19837.45s]  Fine.
[19846.92s -> 19849.00s]  You wouldn't believe how hard it is to actually get that done.
[19867.14s -> 19867.70s]  Who needs help?
[19871.06s -> 19888.08s]  I don't know.
[19888.08s -> 19889.12s]  Is it safe to go down here?
[19907.97s -> 19908.45s]  Boss fight.
[19909.09s -> 19915.67s]  Front flip Andy.
[19921.92s -> 19923.36s]  Over here.
[19924.58s -> 19925.14s]  What?
[19925.14s -> 19926.14s]  How about?
[19948.52s -> 19949.32s]  Take this.
[19949.32s -> 19965.41s]  Did I get it?
[19965.41s -> 19966.45s]  Why can you do that?
[19976.24s -> 19977.92s]  Guys, I gotta be honest.
[19977.92s -> 19980.16s]  I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing right now.
[19983.57s -> 19984.21s]  New objective.
[19984.21s -> 19987.09s]  Clearly obstruction that is blocking the transport.
[19987.09s -> 19987.81s]  Are you a bad guy?
[20019.11s -> 20020.31s]  How do I do Jedi moves?
[20022.07s -> 20022.57s]  Like that.
[20024.79s -> 20025.35s]  Hold on.
[20025.35s -> 20026.15s]  I can pick that up.
[20028.32s -> 20031.32s]  Holy shit.
[20031.32s -> 20031.82s]  All right.
[20033.08s -> 20034.84s]  Transfer at council stop.
[20034.84s -> 20035.56s]  What's going on here?
[20040.90s -> 20044.60s]  Okay.
[20044.60s -> 20045.56s]  All right.
[20045.56s -> 20046.06s]  So go.
[20049.51s -> 20050.01s]  It's not.
[20054.96s -> 20057.38s]  Wait, you have a big health bar.
[20074.08s -> 20075.20s]  I suck.
[20075.20s -> 20101.99s]  Just needed a little extra time.
[20101.99s -> 20112.04s]  I think the disc was spinning.
[20112.04s -> 20115.65s]  We've identified the group that attacked you as the black.
[20115.65s -> 20119.92s]  According to the authorities, they are a group of wanted criminals who up to this point have
[20119.92s -> 20125.08s]  been involved in this sudden escalation in their criminal activity is most concerned.
[20125.08s -> 20126.36s]  I thought that was Yoda talking for a second.
[20126.36s -> 20126.92s]  I was like, what?
[20126.92s -> 20127.56s]  That's Yoda?
[20139.16s -> 20143.78s]  Yoda looked like ruffled up piece of paper.
[20143.78s -> 20147.56s]  I'm sorry, but he did.
[20162.80s -> 20163.30s]  Okay.
[20163.92s -> 20171.43s]  Hello.
[20171.43s -> 20179.67s]  Wait, the robot was a Sith?
[20180.56s -> 20181.76s]  Wait, what is this?
[20220.60s -> 20228.74s]  I'm sorry, but do not give anybody in our group a red lightsaber.
[20228.74s -> 20231.33s]  Are you out of your mind?
[20231.33s -> 20233.51s]  Why did you give him a red lightsaber?
[20233.59s -> 20234.55s]  Give him green.
[20236.32s -> 20237.20s]  Red is evil.
[20246.10s -> 20249.06s]  I'd be able to handle it though.
[20249.06s -> 20251.92s]  I would have a red lightsaber, but I would be good.
[20251.92s -> 20254.29s]  I could handle it.
[20254.29s -> 20257.25s]  I would have a red lightsaber and it'd be dark and mysterious,
[20257.25s -> 20258.45s]  but I would still be a good guy.
[20261.00s -> 20262.18s]  That's me.
[20285.83s -> 20287.27s]  Well, this is where this playthrough ends.
[20287.27s -> 20292.32s]  You can monitor the informant on your
[20292.32s -> 20300.24s]  What was with the early 2000s and having games have just hard fail stealth missions?
[20300.24s -> 20300.88s]  Is that what this is?
[20307.80s -> 20308.36s]  Did I lose?
[20312.32s -> 20312.88s]  It's not.
[20329.70s -> 20330.42s]  What did I do?
[20333.40s -> 20334.12s]  It is.
[20334.12s -> 20339.73s]  It's a fucking hard fail stealth mission and they were obsessed with these
[20339.73s -> 20341.17s]  back in the early 2000s.
[20341.17s -> 20341.67s]  Why?
[20342.63s -> 20343.83s]  Nobody wanted to do this.
[20345.03s -> 20347.99s]  Hard fail stealth missions are the worst of the worst.
[20347.99s -> 20349.03s]  The worst offender.
[20358.31s -> 20358.81s]  What?
[20359.67s -> 20361.75s]  No, I didn't even get to start them.
[20361.75s -> 20362.55s]  No, fuck you.
[20364.61s -> 20365.89s]  You don't get to sound the alarm.
[20366.69s -> 20368.77s]  Anybody come near this button, you're dead.
[20369.41s -> 20370.79s]  I'm just saying.
[20373.60s -> 20381.73s]  Nobody's pressing this.
[20396.95s -> 20397.59s]  You know what?
[20397.59s -> 20398.39s]  I can break it.
[20398.39s -> 20399.19s]  Fuck that, let's go.
[20412.76s -> 20419.16s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[20419.16s -> 20420.44s]  I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[20425.92s -> 20431.54s]  Just destroy all their alarm system shit and nobody can do anything.
[20480.56s -> 20482.71s]  That's gonna kill me.
[20482.71s -> 20485.19s]  No, it's not.
[20485.19s -> 20486.55s]  Infiltrate the lower levels.
[20493.89s -> 20494.85s]  I need a lower level.
[20497.49s -> 20503.01s]  What was that?
[20503.65s -> 20505.09s]  Holy shit, you got me.
[20506.77s -> 20510.00s]  Did I do it?
[20517.43s -> 20518.55s]  Is there anywhere lower to go?
[20543.59s -> 20545.59s]  Come here.
[20563.27s -> 20563.77s]  More!
[20565.08s -> 20565.58s]  More!
[20572.48s -> 20573.44s]  He's bloodthirsty.
[20574.32s -> 20577.48s]  Minus two plus two right next to each other.
[20577.48s -> 20577.98s]  Rare.
[20587.96s -> 20592.61s]  They're really quiet.
[20613.64s -> 20622.16s]  Did I push him even further?
[20625.56s -> 20626.84s]  Wait, this could happen to me too.
[20627.72s -> 20637.94s]  One more layer.
[20644.55s -> 20652.63s]  Do not.
[20652.63s -> 20661.80s]  What kind of lightsaber would you have?
[20662.52s -> 20670.44s]  I would want like two small lightsabers and have them be like Raphael from Ninja Turtles.
[20672.76s -> 20681.32s]  No, I would want a throwing knives made out of lightsaber.
[20692.55s -> 20694.55s]  I would have an ice blue lightsaber.
[20694.55s -> 20695.05s]  Nice.
[20697.03s -> 20697.67s]  Nice, dude.
[20715.08s -> 20717.32s]  This game is kind of fun and I'll tell you why.
[20717.32s -> 20719.40s]  Because the right analog is swing.
[20720.20s -> 20724.04s]  Remember that trend back in the early 2000s where every single game had to have
[20724.04s -> 20728.20s]  movement with the right stick to attack and fight and stuff?
[20728.20s -> 20729.24s]  It actually works kind of well here.
[20729.24s -> 20729.72s]  It's kind of fun.
[20732.04s -> 20747.49s]  That's why I loved this as a kid.
[20748.45s -> 20773.54s]  When do I unlock a horse coat?
[20773.54s -> 20775.30s]  Imagine doing this actually stealth.
[20775.30s -> 20777.06s]  This would be such a boring mission.
[20777.86s -> 20779.06s]  It would take so long.
[20779.06s -> 20780.34s]  This is layer five.
[20781.16s -> 20782.28s]  This would be awful.
[20795.78s -> 20797.06s]  How would you even do this stealth?
[20808.56s -> 20809.60s]  That's it?
[20809.60s -> 20810.32s]  That didn't heal.
[20810.32s -> 20811.12s]  That was not even...
[20812.00s -> 20814.32s]  The health I just gained was just removed.
[20815.36s -> 20829.51s]  That's it?
[20829.51s -> 20830.31s]  That's so bad.
[20839.04s -> 20855.19s]  I'm okay.
[20855.19s -> 20855.69s]  Secret?
[20868.34s -> 20870.18s]  There are lightsaber helicopters?
[20870.18s -> 20870.90s]  What?
[20870.90s -> 20890.02s]  All right, I got the bar on the bottom right is 100% getting burned in.
[20890.02s -> 20893.27s]  Yep, because it's already there.
[20893.27s -> 20897.04s]  I have like three different games sort of burnt in.
[20897.04s -> 20901.88s]  This health and mana, whatever it is, is burnt in right now.
[20901.88s -> 20908.47s]  Thankfully, after the monitor was off for the whole evening, it was fine.
[20909.43s -> 20910.31s]  I'm not concerned about it.
[20911.03s -> 20912.39s]  I'm not worried about it.
[20923.40s -> 20925.48s]  How come they're talking like Lord of the Rings characters?
[20926.93s -> 20927.81s]  Back off, scum.
[20931.04s -> 20931.52s]  Man fell.
[20932.16s -> 20933.04s]  How come they...
[20933.04s -> 20934.64s]  Don't lose because I didn't save the game.
[20943.38s -> 20944.18s]  You spawned.
[20944.18s -> 20945.78s]  That's absolutely bullshit.
[20982.72s -> 20999.83s]  Where do I start from here before I freak out?
[20999.83s -> 21000.33s]  Where...
[21000.95s -> 21001.51s]  I don't know.
[21001.51s -> 21001.99s]  Where am I?
[21002.55s -> 21003.11s]  Is this bad?
[21020.20s -> 21022.68s]  I'm making it read the discs so hard right now.
[21053.88s -> 21055.64s]  Hey, hey boys, go!
[21071.65s -> 21072.15s]  What?
[21077.48s -> 21077.98s]  What's...
[21096.92s -> 21097.80s]  I spawned a secret.
[21117.06s -> 21118.50s]  Game just crashed.
[21118.50s -> 21120.85s]  Oh shit.
[21121.57s -> 21124.92s]  Who's this?
[21137.54s -> 21139.94s]  That was the person I was supposed to save.
[21142.02s -> 21147.27s]  Why were they just staring at me?
[21147.27s -> 21155.72s]  You killed the hostage.
[21155.72s -> 21156.52s]  Why wouldn't you be like,
[21156.52s -> 21158.28s]  Obi-Wan, over here, save me?
[21160.76s -> 21163.08s]  All right, I think I've had just about enough.
[21182.10s -> 21184.10s]  Something's wrong, by the way.
[21184.10s -> 21184.82s]  Something's wrong.
[21185.46s -> 21186.74s]  We lost contact.
[21186.74s -> 21187.78s]  How did you lose contact?
[21187.78s -> 21189.22s]  Does the guy have an earpiece?
[21189.22s -> 21190.50s]  What are you talking about?
[21236.34s -> 21237.38s]  Can't just...
[21237.38s -> 21238.74s]  Why is there no cutscene?
[21242.48s -> 21244.00s]  Why is there no cutscene?
[21244.80s -> 21245.30s]  Why is...
[21246.32s -> 21248.80s]  Why is there no cutscene?
[21248.80s -> 21250.48s]  Okay, I can't fuck this up again.
[21252.50s -> 21255.30s]  I can't fuck this up like a ninth time.
[21263.24s -> 21263.80s]  Just do it...
[21263.80s -> 21264.52s]  Get it right.
[21265.24s -> 21266.36s]  All right, I have a plan.
[21270.63s -> 21271.67s]  Why would they shoot him?
[21272.71s -> 21273.75s]  Whatever, just run.
[21274.47s -> 21276.23s]  And then when I get down to the second level,
[21276.23s -> 21277.27s]  I'm just gonna kill everybody.
[21277.99s -> 21280.61s]  And another thing.
[21302.63s -> 21303.35s]  Don't fuck it up.
[21305.89s -> 21307.09s]  Do not screw this up.
[21307.09s -> 21307.65s]  Take it easy.
[21307.65s -> 21308.21s]  Take it slow.
[21309.09s -> 21310.05s]  Full health.
[21310.05s -> 21311.09s]  Lightsaber out.
[21311.09s -> 21313.01s]  That means it's I am ready.
[21313.89s -> 21315.25s]  And let's go.
[21315.97s -> 21333.09s]  Why would they...
[21334.72s -> 21335.22s]  Shit.
[21336.88s -> 21338.53s]  Where is he?
[21338.53s -> 21339.01s]  Where'd he go?
[21339.57s -> 21340.85s]  Why is he not sitting in the middle?
[21341.83s -> 21342.55s]  Where did the guy go?
[21353.52s -> 21355.44s]  You weren't even tied up this whole time?
[21361.62s -> 21362.34s]  Excuse me?
[21364.42s -> 21364.82s]  What do I...
[21365.62s -> 21368.77s]  What is this guy saying?
[21369.89s -> 21370.69s]  What are you saying?
[21372.31s -> 21373.27s]  Oh, don't come near me.
[21373.27s -> 21373.75s]  Don't come near me.
[21373.75s -> 21374.47s]  What do I do?
[21374.47s -> 21375.43s]  What do I have to do with this?
[21381.64s -> 21383.00s]  You need to die right now.
[21395.89s -> 21397.09s]  You speak perfect English?
[21399.33s -> 21400.69s]  Like very eloquently.
[21403.17s -> 21404.34s]  What's going on?
[21425.24s -> 21427.80s]  This game is just kind of chaos.
[21427.80s -> 21429.80s]  I kind of love it.
[21429.80s -> 21432.12s]  Man, some real bangers tonight.
[21432.12s -> 21435.32s]  I don't think there was a game that I didn't even slow at all.
[21435.32s -> 21436.28s]  These were all bangers.
[21436.28s -> 21437.08s]  All of them.
[21437.08s -> 21438.28s]  Damn Xbox.
[21438.28s -> 21440.10s]  Xbox, you got some good shit.
[21470.79s -> 21471.29s]  Uh-oh.
[21472.31s -> 21472.81s]  Uh-oh.
[21480.37s -> 21481.25s]  I can't wait to hear it.
[21481.25s -> 21481.89s]  Here it comes.
[21494.80s -> 21497.67s]  I could do that this whole time?
[21500.47s -> 21504.85s]  That's scary, isn't it?
[21522.58s -> 21525.60s]  Where do I go from here?
[21537.75s -> 21539.11s]  Kind of hard to hit, aren't I?
[21547.44s -> 21548.56s]  Where am I supposed to go?
[21549.36s -> 21555.36s]  This is not connected to anything, is it?
[21556.24s -> 21556.74s]  Oh.
[21606.63s -> 21618.20s]  Don't.
[21618.20s -> 21618.70s]  Don't.
[21632.07s -> 21632.95s]  God damn it.
[21632.95s -> 21633.35s]  I'm okay.
[21692.66s -> 21693.78s]  These guys are so hard.
[21693.78s -> 21694.74s]  All right, get me out of here.
[21722.58s -> 21729.19s]  Don't even have to let him do it himself.
[21740.87s -> 21743.59s]  You did the Dark Souls PvP near the ledge thing.
[21743.59s -> 21744.31s]  We've all been there.
[21744.95s -> 21745.45s]  Sucks.
[21771.44s -> 21778.28s]  But surely the process of synthesizing cortosis into armor and weapons is far too
[21778.28s -> 21780.92s]  expensive and sophisticated by the Jinhal.
[21780.92s -> 21782.72s]  Those be involved.
[21782.72s -> 21786.00s]  It is well you succeeded in placing a tracker on their ship.
[21786.00s -> 21789.76s]  You're sending Master's Klo Koon and Eeth Koth to investigate.
[21789.76s -> 21791.12s]  We shall soon learn more.
[21791.12s -> 21795.09s]  Now to proceed to the trial arena, Obi-Wan.
[21795.09s -> 21797.01s]  You must be prepared.
[21797.01s -> 21799.25s]  Somebody said that Qui-Gon looks weird.
[21799.25s -> 21801.33s]  Like there's something off about Qui-Gon.
[21801.33s -> 21803.41s]  Yeah, something's off about Qui-Gon's model.
[21804.29s -> 21819.33s]  Another another Sith Lord robot by any chance.
[21827.96s -> 21828.46s]  Okay.
[21831.67s -> 21832.17s]  Hi.
[21832.71s -> 21833.91s]  So what do you want to teach me?
[21835.03s -> 21836.87s]  Now, okay, that hurt for real.
[21836.87s -> 21837.83s]  That hurt for real.
[21838.39s -> 21840.63s]  I just want to make sure you understand that hurt for real.
[21841.43s -> 21844.47s]  We're not using wooden swords.
[21844.47s -> 21880.10s]  What a lame fight.
[21895.33s -> 21896.29s]  He just killed me.
[21897.41s -> 21898.93s]  You killed Obi-Wan.
[21898.93s -> 21900.77s]  Sai Sith Tim gives no quarter.
[21900.77s -> 21902.53s]  When you defeat him, you will be ready.
[21903.78s -> 21906.10s]  You would like to try again, Padawan.
[21906.10s -> 21907.86s]  You're going to revive me?
[21911.60s -> 21916.56s]  Use force lightning?
[21916.56s -> 21918.00s]  That's what I would want more than anything.
[21918.64s -> 21919.76s]  I don't want a lightsaber.
[21919.76s -> 21925.25s]  I want to just be able to be like boom lightsaber.
[21925.25s -> 21926.29s]  That's hand to hand.
[21926.29s -> 21926.79s]  I don't know.
[21927.43s -> 21927.93s]  It hurt.
[21931.56s -> 21932.60s]  That was quite an intro.
[21955.88s -> 21957.64s]  You can't be serious.
[21958.44s -> 21964.42s]  Sai Sith Tim gives no quarter.
[21964.42s -> 21966.10s]  When you defeat him, you will be ready.
[21966.10s -> 21966.90s]  Stop jumping.
[21966.90s -> 21967.46s]  What the fuck?
[21967.46s -> 21968.74s]  I like to try again.
[21968.74s -> 21971.22s]  It's just mapped to A and I press A all the time.
[21971.86s -> 21973.16s]  I'll get it right now.
[21976.04s -> 21977.80s]  Where's like where's force bite?
[21979.43s -> 21993.78s]  Didn't expect that, did you?
[21995.80s -> 21998.92s]  Your little WWE entrance got interrupted, didn't it?
[22026.58s -> 22027.08s]  Stop.
[22028.86s -> 22029.36s]  It's hard.
[22034.89s -> 22036.81s]  Sai Sith Tim gives no quarter.
[22036.81s -> 22038.49s]  When you defeat him, you will be ready.
[22039.74s -> 22046.33s]  You would like to try again, Padawan.
[22046.33s -> 22048.09s]  Oh, I'm not a journalist.
[22048.73s -> 22052.73s]  And there are tons of very talented game journalists out there.
[22052.73s -> 22056.28s]  A lot of them, tons of them.
[22056.28s -> 22056.92s]  You don't know any.
[22056.92s -> 22057.48s]  What do you know?
[22066.25s -> 22067.93s]  I tried to just kill this guy.
[22068.89s -> 22070.89s]  That was not a sparring move.
[22070.89s -> 22073.13s]  I'm trying to bury this into your head.
[22121.35s -> 22130.30s]  I think I should end this game now.
[22130.30s -> 22131.10s]  Don't be a weirdo.
[22132.14s -> 22135.32s]  Sai Sith Tim gives no quarter.
[22135.32s -> 22137.08s]  When you defeat him, you will be ready.
[22138.31s -> 22142.02s]  You would like to try again, Padawan.
[22142.02s -> 22142.66s]  Say something.
[22142.66s -> 22143.46s]  I am focused.
[22145.72s -> 22147.56s]  Down on the right stick to parry.
[22147.56s -> 22154.71s]  Does that work?
[22154.71s -> 22156.15s]  Holding left trigger blocks.
[22167.10s -> 22167.74s]  I think that worked.
[22168.54s -> 22170.01s]  Why would they not tell me that?
[22171.03s -> 22173.51s]  They told me this guy was going to teach me shit.
[22173.51s -> 22174.63s]  And he didn't teach me anything.
[22175.43s -> 22176.95s]  He just walked in and started swinging at me.
[22178.55s -> 22181.11s]  In every other video game, it's like, let me show you something.
[22181.11s -> 22183.43s]  When I swing at you, what I want you to do is,
[22183.43s -> 22185.67s]  I want you to dodge to the left and press X, right?
[22185.67s -> 22187.59s]  Like, he just walked in here and attacked me.
[22223.69s -> 22227.74s]  The saber is most impressive.
[22228.38s -> 22231.18s]  The force is indeed strong in you, young Obi-Wan.
[22231.18s -> 22231.66s]  I get it.
[22231.66s -> 22232.38s]  But beware.
[22235.66s -> 22239.18s]  Obi-Wan, Master Tin, come quickly to the council chambers.
[22239.18s -> 22241.90s]  Something has happened to Master Plo Koon and Ith Koth.
[22242.54s -> 22247.08s]  It's a surprise birthday party.
[22248.28s -> 22248.84s]  This is what they did.
[22248.84s -> 22250.36s]  They got rid of me for a minute.
[22250.36s -> 22253.40s]  So they could set up the surprise birthday party.
[22253.40s -> 22255.24s]  Like, come quick, hurry, back to the chamber.
[22255.24s -> 22256.36s]  And it's going to be a big birthday cake.
[22261.45s -> 22264.81s]  Somebody said, who the fuck are all these people?
[22264.81s -> 22272.31s]  You must not consume very much Star Wars.
[22273.43s -> 22274.79s]  But I don't know either.
[22274.79s -> 22277.19s]  I know who Luke is.
[22277.19s -> 22278.79s]  I know who Darth Vader is.
[22278.79s -> 22281.24s]  I know who Qui-Gon Jinn is.
[22281.24s -> 22282.92s]  The situation has become very serious.
[22282.92s -> 22284.60s]  I know who the Ewoks are.
[22306.01s -> 22307.77s]  Where is he going?
[22307.77s -> 22309.13s]  He just walked in a circle.
[22329.80s -> 22330.52s]  You take the lead.
[22331.80s -> 22332.52s]  You take the lead.
[22332.52s -> 22332.68s]  Go.
[22332.68s -> 22335.64s]  I want to see what Master Qui-Gon Jinn can do.
[22351.94s -> 22353.30s]  You're kind of not very good.
[22368.33s -> 22384.10s]  The families are going to be so sad.
[22384.66s -> 22388.66s]  Watch out for snipers.
[22389.86s -> 22390.42s]  Snipers.
[22392.42s -> 22400.34s]  Hurry Obi-Wan.
[22401.06s -> 22402.02s]  Ow.
[22409.27s -> 22409.91s]  Help.
[22409.91s -> 22410.31s]  Help.
[22410.31s -> 22410.79s]  Help.
[22410.79s -> 22411.11s]  Help.
[22411.11s -> 22411.43s]  Help.
[22412.79s -> 22413.43s]  Help.
[22413.43s -> 22413.83s]  Help.
[22414.63s -> 22416.87s]  Help.
[22416.87s -> 22417.27s]  Dad.
[22418.47s -> 22420.07s]  I know you probably need a dad.
[22420.07s -> 22421.27s]  But where's the...
[22421.27s -> 22422.07s]  I need some help.
[22424.07s -> 22424.71s]  Where did he go?
[22424.71s -> 22430.97s]  I got sniped out of the air.
[22440.70s -> 22441.02s]  All right.
[22441.02s -> 22441.98s]  I might...
[22441.98s -> 22443.98s]  It might be time to call it for tonight.
[22445.66s -> 22448.10s]  Another one or two attempts.
[22448.10s -> 22448.58s]  No help.
[22453.37s -> 22454.33s]  Can I reflect it back?
[22464.94s -> 22465.82s]  There are animals here.
[22471.24s -> 22472.04s]  That's cool looking.
[22477.53s -> 22478.33s]  Where's Qui-Gon?
[22482.38s -> 22483.42s]  I don't think I can kill them.
[22489.85s -> 22490.57s]  Where's Qui-Gon?
[22502.87s -> 22503.59s]  Honestly, where is he?
[22503.59s -> 22504.07s]  Where the hell?
[22513.66s -> 22519.48s]  This looks like a developer area.
[22519.48s -> 22520.68s]  I feel like I'm not supposed to be up here.
[22536.70s -> 22537.42s]  Snipers.
[22540.39s -> 22541.11s]  What?
[22541.11s -> 22543.21s]  Is he in a tree?
[22570.25s -> 22570.89s]  Fuck off.
[22571.77s -> 22572.81s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[22611.78s -> 22612.26s]  Oh.
[22612.26s -> 22614.90s]  Hurry up.
[22614.90s -> 22615.22s]  We have to...
[22621.99s -> 22622.47s]  Wait, did...
[22622.47s -> 22623.75s]  Now let us press the attack.
[22624.86s -> 22625.26s]  What happened?
[22625.26s -> 22625.74s]  Did I...
[22625.74s -> 22627.10s]  Did we get teleported back?
[22651.56s -> 22652.60s]  I don't want to lose Qui-Gon.
[22657.62s -> 22659.62s]  Dude, what are you doing down here?
[22659.62s -> 22660.26s]  Ow.
[22660.26s -> 22660.58s]  Stop.
[22674.90s -> 22675.54s]  I'm just...
[22675.54s -> 22676.34s]  I'm just going.
[22702.15s -> 22702.79s]  No.
[22702.79s -> 22703.19s]  Please.
[22706.26s -> 22706.66s]  I'm done.
[22707.30s -> 22707.70s]  I'm done.
[22707.70s -> 22708.10s]  I'm done.
[22708.26s -> 22708.90s]  I'm done.
[22708.90s -> 22709.62s]  This was fun.
[22709.62s -> 22710.34s]  This was a good one.
[22710.34s -> 22712.10s]  This was fun, but I don't want to do this anymore.
[22712.10s -> 22713.14s]  This level sucks.
[22713.78s -> 22716.41s]  This level is just like a big green plane.
[22716.97s -> 22718.25s]  And you just walk forward.
[22718.25s -> 22722.41s]  This is like a thousand G-Mod spawned sniper people.
[22722.41s -> 22723.90s]  This mission is...
[22723.90s -> 22725.06s]  One more.
[22727.29s -> 22741.22s]  Token.
[22742.42s -> 22749.56s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[22750.36s -> 22751.08s]  I'm invincible.
[22756.62s -> 22757.90s]  What direction do I go?
[22757.90s -> 22758.78s]  What direction do I go?
[22759.74s -> 22760.14s]  This way?
[22761.02s -> 22763.62s]  That's water.
[22763.62s -> 22764.02s]  I'm dead.
[22764.74s -> 22776.74s]  I've survived my facility and discovered the source of their weapons technology.
[22776.74s -> 22779.06s]  We can still turn defeat into victory.
[22779.62s -> 22784.07s]  Can I do it?
[22784.63s -> 22785.43s]  I think it's beautiful.
[22787.77s -> 22788.01s]  Oh.
[22796.65s -> 22797.13s]  Oh.
[22797.13s -> 22810.52s]  That works.
[22810.52s -> 22814.20s]  Master, I found the entrance to some kind of large mining complex.
[22816.26s -> 22818.58s]  Undoubtedly a cortosis mine.
[22818.58s -> 22822.18s]  I'll wait till there's some kind of manufacturing plant inside.
[22822.18s -> 22824.66s]  See what kind of evidence you could gather down there.
[22824.66s -> 22830.34s]  I'm not sure.
[22830.34s -> 22831.22s]  I'm not sure.
[22831.22s -> 22835.22s]  I'm not sure.
[22837.43s -> 22841.00s]  I'm not sure.
[22841.88s -> 22842.76s]  I'm not sure.
[22911.96s -> 22912.44s]  I'm done.
[22912.44s -> 22913.08s]  I'll see you later.
[22915.26s -> 22915.74s]  I'm done.
[22917.02s -> 22918.14s]  End of the stream run.
[22918.14s -> 22919.26s]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[22921.72s -> 22922.60s]  One more.
[22922.60s -> 22923.08s]  One more.
[22923.08s -> 22925.00s]  We'll go out last when I try to run through it.
[22925.00s -> 22926.97s]  But do another game?
[22927.69s -> 22928.65s]  This is so much fun.
[22929.45s -> 22930.17s]  Don't worry.
[22930.17s -> 22930.89s]  We're doing this again.
[22932.20s -> 22932.68s]  Very soon.
[22934.49s -> 22935.45s]  One last run through.
[22953.80s -> 22974.55s]  How did I fall the second fucking time?
[22975.27s -> 22983.62s]  How did I fall the second time?
[22986.62s -> 22987.02s]  All right.
[22987.02s -> 22987.50s]  That's it.
[22987.50s -> 22987.98s]  That was fun.
[22989.88s -> 22991.08s]  A raid just came in too.
[22991.08s -> 22992.52s]  Well, thanks for the raid.
[22992.52s -> 22993.32s]  Welcome.
[22993.32s -> 22996.41s]  We are ending right this very moment.
[22996.97s -> 23002.62s]  That was console gaming weekend and there is...
[23003.26s -> 23005.69s]  So remember when I said the reason why I was doing this
[23005.69s -> 23008.49s]  is because I wanted to get through some of the ones
[23008.49s -> 23009.61s]  that I didn't do years ago?
[23010.17s -> 23013.70s]  Like, oh, I still have like 10 or so 15 games to play, right?
[23014.50s -> 23016.90s]  Well, I added 30, 40, 50 more.
[23017.70s -> 23021.14s]  So now instead of having 10 or 15 to do left,
[23021.14s -> 23023.54s]  there's like still like 25.
[23024.57s -> 23025.37s]  I added more.
[23030.20s -> 23031.40s]  We got caught on somebody.
[23031.40s -> 23031.80s]  There was two.
[23031.80s -> 23032.28s]  They were fun.
[23032.84s -> 23034.68s]  Hey, you get caught on them.
[23034.68s -> 23035.00s]  That's fine.
[23035.56s -> 23038.12s]  Do a DS scream.
[23038.12s -> 23042.01s]  I probably will eventually.
[23042.01s -> 23043.37s]  I want to do N64 as well.
[23045.62s -> 23046.34s]  Ratchet and Clank.
[23050.07s -> 23051.11s]  We are doing this again.
[23052.58s -> 23054.66s]  I'm just going to make another pile and just move stuff
[23054.66s -> 23057.45s]  we've already played to another section
[23057.45s -> 23059.13s]  so I don't accidentally do it again.
[23060.28s -> 23061.16s]  That was the Xbox.
[23061.16s -> 23063.48s]  That was Xbox Night number one.
[23063.48s -> 23066.36s]  Probably of at least three or four,
[23066.36s -> 23068.12s]  judging by how much is sitting in front of me here.
[23070.74s -> 23072.58s]  So the next time you will see me live,
[23074.89s -> 23076.17s]  this is where it's going to get interesting
[23076.17s -> 23081.22s]  because Ster and I are going to do the Elden Ring co-op
[23081.22s -> 23082.10s]  this coming weekend.
[23082.10s -> 23086.38s]  I think either the 21st or the 22nd,
[23086.38s -> 23087.34s]  I think is what we were thinking.
[23088.22s -> 23090.14s]  So that's happening this weekend.
[23090.14s -> 23094.07s]  So we'll probably just come back with the Xbox
[23094.07s -> 23099.00s]  in a couple days on Wednesday.
[23099.00s -> 23100.52s]  So we'll do Wednesday Xbox
[23101.58s -> 23105.80s]  and then maybe Friday Xbox
[23105.80s -> 23107.08s]  and then whenever Elden Ring happens.
[23107.08s -> 23108.28s]  So I'll see you on Wednesday.
[23108.28s -> 23116.60s]  See you in a couple days.
[23116.60s -> 23117.48s]  I'm just going to keep it all here.
[23117.48s -> 23119.32s]  I'm not going to tear it down or anything.
[23119.32s -> 23124.38s]  We'll just keep going.
[23124.38s -> 23125.10s]  Thanks for hanging out.
[23125.10s -> 23127.29s]  Thanks for watching there.
[23128.41s -> 23131.32s]  Um, it's a ton of fun.
[23131.32s -> 23132.20s]  I love doing this.
[23132.20s -> 23137.75s]  We talked about it last night,
[23137.75s -> 23140.07s]  but one of the big reasons why it's so much fun to do this
[23140.07s -> 23142.86s]  is because you can just move on
[23142.86s -> 23144.62s]  or I play it for three or four hours.
[23144.62s -> 23147.08s]  You just kind of never know what you're going to get.
[23147.08s -> 23158.50s]  But yeah, and then the Elden Ring co-op stuff.
[23158.50s -> 23159.86s]  I don't know if we're going to do that
[23159.86s -> 23162.62s]  for more than a couple of days.
[23162.62s -> 23165.35s]  I can't imagine that's going to be something that happens.
[23165.35s -> 23170.28s]  I mean, we're going to do randomizer co-op.
[23170.28s -> 23173.56s]  It's going to be a mess.
[23173.56s -> 23175.88s]  But oh, I love tweet.
[23175.88s -> 23177.16s]  Thanks for the raid.
[23177.16s -> 23180.87s]  I think there were a couple of raids tonight that I missed.
[23180.95s -> 23182.98s]  I was too in it.
[23182.98s -> 23187.03s]  But if you just came from Love Tweed's stream,
[23187.03s -> 23188.31s]  thanks for rating.
[23188.31s -> 23192.79s]  Sorry that we're turning it off immediately after you get here.
[23192.79s -> 23201.88s]  But appreciate it.
[23201.88s -> 23204.04s]  Vinny's playing a Star Wars game right now, too.
[23207.42s -> 23208.30s]  What is Vinny doing?
[23208.30s -> 23218.42s]  Let's see.
[23218.42s -> 23220.42s]  Star Wars Dark Forces.
[23220.42s -> 23225.59s]  See if it's as good as Obi-Wan.
[23225.59s -> 23227.94s]  All right.
[23227.94s -> 23228.66s]  Yeah, we'll raid Vinny.
[23228.66s -> 23230.26s]  We haven't raided anybody in a long time.
[23230.26s -> 23231.99s]  So let's raid Vinny.
[23231.99s -> 23235.83s]  It's been at least a few weeks,
[23235.83s -> 23237.03s]  at least a couple of weeks.
[23237.03s -> 23248.76s]  Go say hello to Vinny playing Star Wars Dark Forces mod.
[23248.76s -> 23249.64s]  Very cool.
[23252.90s -> 23254.10s]  Give my best.
[23254.10s -> 23257.91s]  And I'll see you later.
[23257.91s -> 23259.34s]  See you Wednesday.
[23259.34s -> 23259.90s]  Good night.
[23259.90s -> 23260.62s]  Goodbye.
[23260.62s -> 23262.30s]  Call your mother.
[23262.30s -> 23263.48s]  See you later.
[23297.37s -> 23298.33s]  Oh, I'm not muted.
[23298.89s -> 23310.20s]  See you later.
