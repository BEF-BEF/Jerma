[0.70s -> 9.26s]  Good afternoon. How are you doing? This moment's going down in history.
[9.26s -> 19.29s]  It's the second time I've ever sworn off a Mario Maker game in one day.
[19.29s -> 23.05s]  I got a lot of heat for this one. People say in German, you said
[23.05s -> 26.97s]  Mario Maker, you said you've never played ever again and you you hated it.
[26.97s -> 31.05s]  I didn't hate the game, but I mean I did say that, but this is Mario, this
[31.05s -> 34.01s]  is a different game. This is Mario Maker 2.
[34.01s -> 44.79s]  Not the same game. Yeah okay so I swore this is a bit different video game.
[44.79s -> 52.97s]  It's the same game. No it's not. They added Super Mario 3D world levels.
[52.97s -> 59.64s]  Sorry so much research you've done. Wow.
[59.64s -> 68.17s]  What really? I was under the assumption that everybody like loved
[68.17s -> 71.21s]  Super Mario. What happened? What happened?
[71.21s -> 131.77s]  Nobody likes Super Mario anymore? All right give me one second.
[131.85s -> 135.08s]  All right so we're gonna do this for a little while.
[135.08s -> 138.28s]  And I don't know if it's fun. We'll keep doing it. If not then
[138.28s -> 146.76s]  I got no plan man you know. He came back. Yeah of course I came back.
[146.76s -> 154.23s]  So let's go. I mean why not right? Here it is.
[154.23s -> 159.56s]  I've only got 335 seconds remaining. Oh wait I have to do an audio test
[159.56s -> 164.63s]  with you guys. Hold on let me just test the audio.
[164.63s -> 169.24s]  Make sure this is synced up. All right ready?
[169.24s -> 172.89s]  I'm gonna jump and I'm gonna grab the coin. Ready?
[172.89s -> 179.69s]  Now got. How we doing? Jump jump jump jump jump.
[179.69s -> 192.46s]  Are we synced? I think that should be good. Should be is the right
[192.46s -> 199.34s]  question. My voice is low. Hold on. I did do some messing around with my
[199.34s -> 202.89s]  audio. So let me see if I fuck something up.
[202.89s -> 208.07s]  Better? I think I think that's better. I don't think I was messing around
[208.07s -> 215.43s]  with audio bits. I should be louder now. All right
[215.43s -> 220.12s]  So anyways I don't I don't know anything about this.
[220.12s -> 226.02s]  I didn't watch the direct. They did a whole direct about here comes
[226.02s -> 229.38s]  Super Mario Maker 2. Get excited for it.
[229.38s -> 232.95s]  I didn't watch it. All I know is that they just made another one.
[232.95s -> 238.18s]  Is there anything I need to know? This is yeah this is all fresh to me.
[238.18s -> 247.46s]  Completely fresh. He doesn't know. Well I opened this and I made an
[247.46s -> 250.02s]  account. I ain't gonna make a level by the
[250.02s -> 252.66s]  way guys. You think you're gonna get that on this stream? You are out of
[252.82s -> 263.11s]  mind. So there's a campaign. Should I play the campaign?
[263.11s -> 280.89s]  There is a campaign. Well it wasn't easy but we finally finished the castle.
[280.89s -> 290.57s]  Yeah out of this this is messing with my immersion. Mario's a plumber. He's
[290.57s -> 294.26s]  not a construction worker. Couldn't have done it without you
[294.26s -> 306.06s]  Chief Princess Peach. He'll be thrilled. Mario's not a construction worker. He's a carpenter. He's a plumber.
[306.06s -> 310.06s]  They changed that. Yes he was a carpenter back in the in the in the
[310.06s -> 319.56s]  original but this is 2019 Mario. The resort reset rocket lying around.
[319.56s -> 324.09s]  It wasn't me Chief. Pretty sure it was
[324.09s -> 334.78s]  the dog. Is it a dog? New character. Oh it's the dog. I can't make a name
[334.78s -> 341.46s]  up right now. It's Marshmallow. No that's like a
[341.46s -> 345.46s]  it's a dude that like makes like EDM music.
[354.30s -> 371.06s]  Get off the button. What the hell is going on? Okay see this is why I'm a cat
[371.06s -> 376.70s]  person. All right so all that hard work just
[376.70s -> 381.99s]  gone. See this is why I'm a cat person.
[381.99s -> 385.27s]  I can't believe it. Princess Peach's castle.
[385.27s -> 389.67s]  We have to rebuild it but we've used up our entire budget. This is
[389.67s -> 395.64s]  really bad. Oh too bad you can't say like
[395.64s -> 399.93s]  your problem. Leave it to me I'll handle it.
[399.93s -> 406.17s]  I guess I'll handle it. Of course why did I think of that? You can collect
[406.17s -> 411.70s]  enough coins for us to rebuild. With help we can make an even bigger
[411.70s -> 415.70s]  and better castle than before. Go see if the task master can scrape
[415.70s -> 423.56s]  together a few jobs for you. I need funding. Mario secures funding.
[423.56s -> 427.22s]  Okay I wasn't eavesdropping or anything but I kind of sort of
[427.22s -> 430.74s]  overheard your entire conversation with Chief.
[431.19s -> 435.75s]  Lucky for us I got a line on some jobs from around the world.
[435.75s -> 439.51s]  If you complete enough jobs we should be able to make enough coins to rebuild
[439.51s -> 443.75s]  the whole castle. I gotta say no one you're gonna
[443.75s -> 446.95s]  single-handedly fund this entire construction effort really takes the
[446.95s -> 451.27s]  pressure off me you know. Okay no time to waste check out this
[451.27s -> 456.86s]  job from someone named uh Goomba Lover. Most of these clients
[456.86s -> 460.46s]  don't use their real names. I don't ask too many questions
[460.54s -> 467.48s]  as long as they cough up the coins. Got like what would this
[467.48s -> 471.24s]  okay never mind. Downhill battle 100 coins.
[471.24s -> 474.60s]  I made a course full of Goombas. First one to get the gold pole
[474.60s -> 479.00s]  gets paid. Here's a tip tilt down on the downward slopes to wipe out the
[479.00s -> 486.57s]  Goombas. My Goomba Lover. This guy get off
[486.57s -> 490.23s]  to this? Is that what's going on here? I don't
[490.23s -> 504.62s]  understand. All right let's do it. I'm already big can I get a big guy?
[504.70s -> 510.92s]  Yeah I can. Oh it's been so long since I've played Super Mario.
[510.92s -> 524.10s]  What's what I believe in you. What do you mean? This is probably the
[524.10s -> 525.94s]  best song that they've ever made either.
[525.94s -> 532.87s]  Either I mean ever. So do I have to collect the coins or
[532.87s -> 536.79s]  do you just get the coins? That's a secret hold on.
[536.79s -> 543.00s]  No wait okay this is the panic button. Every time you get a star you have to
[543.00s -> 548.79s]  go panic mode. If I die on the first level I'm going
[548.79s -> 551.43s]  to stop playing again. Just make sure I want you guys to be very aware of
[551.43s -> 556.07s]  that. If I die on the first fucking Goomba
[556.07s -> 564.79s]  Lover level I'm going to... okay we're good.
[564.79s -> 572.04s]  You can't die. Yes you can if I walk into the Goombas twice.
[572.04s -> 579.77s]  Collected payment. Did they take this shit from
[579.77s -> 586.04s]  Mario Odyssey? We have to get like a currency and pay?
[586.12s -> 589.56s]  All right so let's play the foundation. Do I have enough money?
[589.56s -> 596.38s]  Did you get some coins? Yes I do. Oh you do. It does add to your balance.
[596.38s -> 601.05s]  Mario Odyssey invented currency. No but I like how you had to pay the
[601.05s -> 605.29s]  currency to make the ship better and fly. I have to pay the currency to
[605.29s -> 613.24s]  build the castle back. Yeah okay. Choose foundation to put in
[613.24s -> 616.70s]  the work order. Do I get to make my own castle?
[616.70s -> 621.93s]  You sure about that? No I'm not sure. Just keep it leveled.
[621.93s -> 630.68s]  Let's work out of a tent from now on. Do I have to tap the screen really fast?
[630.68s -> 636.34s]  Construction has started on the foundation. We'll keep working while
[636.34s -> 640.55s]  you're off making moola. So get out there and do some more
[640.55s -> 648.18s]  jobs. I got three new jobs for you. All right a word of advice from old
[648.18s -> 651.70s]  Taskmaster Toad. You can run the same job as many
[651.70s -> 654.90s]  times as you want. You won't get paid for it again.
[654.90s -> 658.87s]  But you get coins that you pick up.
[658.95s -> 663.35s]  Now back to work. Some new jobs just came in.
[663.35s -> 667.11s]  On-off switch research expedition. These are these are
[667.11s -> 671.93s]  I wouldn't eat here. All right on-off switch.
[671.93s -> 677.02s]  Might as well just do them in order. Hmm the on-off switch. No one really
[677.02s -> 681.74s]  knows how it actually works. Wireless protocols. Ancient magic. Get
[681.74s -> 683.82s]  to the end of this course and reward you handsomely.
[683.82s -> 690.17s]  Dr. Gizmo. Good luck out there big red.
[698.25s -> 704.87s]  This is a new style. Hold on on. Oh that's how the on-off switch works
[704.87s -> 716.44s]  guys. In just a case you didn't know. One two three. All right I'm done
[716.44s -> 718.68s]  playing. I'm gonna like stream myself eat a burrito.
[718.68s -> 733.26s]  Like I don't think I want to do this anymore. Um that was quick.
[733.26s -> 741.13s]  Trap him. Oh fuck I can't die here otherwise I have to fucking delete my
[741.13s -> 745.21s]  account.
[745.21s -> 753.11s]  Do you guys think that that's a joke?
[753.11s -> 761.02s]  Okay when I when I'm done. When I'm when I'm fucking done and I mean done
[761.02s -> 764.92s]  with Twitch YouTube don't matter right.
[764.92s -> 767.96s]  I'm gonna do that one day. I'm just gonna be like you know what yeah if I
[767.96s -> 770.44s]  die here I'm deleting my account and I'm gonna die and I'm gonna delete
[770.44s -> 780.30s]  my account and you'll never see me again.
[780.30s -> 787.75s]  Got him. Well I need those coins. Too icy.
[787.75s -> 796.87s]  What's happening right now? Why is everything this is happening today?
[796.87s -> 806.60s]  You guys are acting like I'm doing this in an hour. Hold on wait.
[806.60s -> 809.80s]  There's a secret down here I think. This is a secret.
[809.80s -> 822.57s]  Fuck I can't get it. Super coin. How do I get down there?
[822.57s -> 830.36s]  I'm gonna keep it off. I found it. Check this out.
[830.36s -> 844.57s]  Now it's not blocked. Now it. Wait. Oops. It's all right. I. Now.
[844.57s -> 868.87s]  Let's go. Can't go up. This is gonna be weird. Check this out.
[868.87s -> 876.12s]  No no no no. Stay in there. Can it just kill me? Will I get teleporter exited
[876.12s -> 893.59s]  if I stand there? Let's test it. Nope. Got it. I'm gonna do that every
[893.59s -> 896.07s]  single time. So you may as well leave now if you
[896.07s -> 911.67s]  don't want to hear that again. You're not gonna win enough for that
[911.67s -> 915.59s]  to happen. So I asked this in the pre-stream chat.
[915.59s -> 922.17s]  Did they get rid of the 100 Mario thing? Is there still expert difficulty?
[922.25s -> 927.69s]  Is it still regular? Just normal? How did they do that?
[927.69s -> 934.76s]  I need two more. I kind of like this. What's going on? Once we finish the
[934.76s -> 937.32s]  foundation the real work begins. This is kind of fun.
[937.32s -> 948.41s]  All right so we got hello 3D world. I've played at all these cute trees in my
[948.41s -> 951.53s]  garden. Would someone try reaching the goal by climbing the trees with up?
[951.53s -> 954.25s]  I haven't weeded the garden in a while but if the piranha plants give
[954.25s -> 956.57s]  you trouble just stomp them into the dirt.
[956.57s -> 963.32s]  Okay. You don't have to read this. It's Mario.
[963.32s -> 969.96s]  Why wouldn't I read it? I'm just gonna skip it?
[969.96s -> 974.50s]  Why wouldn't I read that? Did I just say
[974.50s -> 980.07s]  I am so in love with this teaser of Diablo 3
[980.07s -> 983.11s]  image screenshot here? Some of you guys are gonna know what I'm talking
[983.11s -> 991.93s]  about. Stomp them, right? How do you stomp?
[991.93s -> 1004.55s]  Like that. Oops. What the fuck am I on?
[1004.55s -> 1010.07s]  It sounds like you got it. I don't need to explain everything.
[1010.07s -> 1013.35s]  People get mad at me when I explain the reference. They go we know we know
[1013.35s -> 1024.10s]  and I go what the fuck? Climb the tree.
[1024.10s -> 1034.90s]  That's cool. Can I do the double triple jump?
[1034.90s -> 1040.33s]  So I'm a casual fucking fan. Not even. I'm not even a fan.
[1040.33s -> 1044.33s]  Some people would probably mad at me knowing that this is the
[1044.33s -> 1047.69s]  the last Mario game that I actually opened and played
[1047.69s -> 1052.97s]  was Mario Maker 1. On top of that before that
[1052.97s -> 1058.89s]  you have to go back to Mario Galaxy 1.
[1058.89s -> 1065.66s]  Am I a cat? Oh the internet's gonna love this one.
[1065.66s -> 1073.38s]  Can I do anything else with the cat? You just scratch.
[1073.38s -> 1090.10s]  Wait a minute. How do I get that? Whatever.
[1090.10s -> 1095.66s]  Hey big bro if you're having trouble with the course use some assist parts.
[1095.66s -> 1106.46s]  Oh shit there he is. It's Luigi. He's showing up already. I can't wait
[1106.46s -> 1114.26s]  till the next time I die and it goes don't cry. Give the controller to your
[1114.26s -> 1124.38s]  older brother. I can't do Mario. Don't worry don't cry.
[1124.38s -> 1134.98s]  Okay I gotta attack that with the cat.
[1134.98s -> 1140.63s]  I didn't know I could do that. I didn't know. When was this? Have they ever
[1140.63s -> 1151.11s]  used this suit before? Wait you can climb walls as the cat?
[1151.19s -> 1170.58s]  What? I need you. No I want to jump. I want to jump his head. Hold on.
[1170.58s -> 1176.14s]  You can sprint faster as the cat too. That's I don't need anymore. I don't need
[1176.14s -> 1179.75s]  anymore. He's not reading chat. Why I can't how
[1179.75s -> 1184.71s]  am I gonna read chat and play this incredibly incredibly intense game?
[1184.71s -> 1193.29s]  I can actually climb this too. Oh it has the cat curtains. I get it.
[1193.29s -> 1200.04s]  That's cute. How do I get these?
[1200.04s -> 1217.94s]  No no don't do it again. I'm all right. Funner.
[1217.94s -> 1232.02s]  Funnest. What is this? I don't care. What is that even for?
[1232.02s -> 1251.54s]  Oh shit. Hold on. Get rid of those. All right so can I can I climb that wall?
[1251.54s -> 1255.06s]  Does it have to be a specific cat wall?
[1263.72s -> 1283.10s]  Oh he falls off. So what uh Mario was this one from?
[1283.10s -> 1300.06s]  Climb it. No not climb. Climb that. This is fun. Cat's really hot right now.
[1300.06s -> 1303.34s]  That's because I played Super Mario Galaxy 1
[1303.34s -> 1310.54s]  10 years ago and I just admitted that on the internet.
[1310.54s -> 1313.74s]  So I may as well have like strangled three people.
[1313.74s -> 1328.39s]  All right got the foundation. Two foundations. I haven't owned one since
[1328.39s -> 1337.11s]  the Game Boy days. Relax. There's like some.
[1337.11s -> 1343.77s]  Oh nice gazebo. Castle's gonna be rock solid.
[1343.77s -> 1347.26s]  Okay let's get this castle rebuilt. Where do you want to start?
[1347.26s -> 1354.87s]  Oh I don't know. West hall. Main hall. East hall.
[1354.87s -> 1364.04s]  What do you guys think? West. I mean what I what I what I was about to
[1364.04s -> 1368.95s]  say. Who cares? I would be so desperately
[1368.95s -> 1372.52s]  reaching for a reason at this point. Well I used to live on the East
[1372.52s -> 1376.28s]  Coast but now I live on the West Coast. Who cares?
[1376.28s -> 1389.59s]  What does that have to do with anything? But wait a minute. What about the one in
[1389.59s -> 1397.02s]  the middle? I need more coins. Why do you hate these games? What? I
[1397.02s -> 1401.54s]  don't hate these games. What? Where are you getting this? I'm gonna do
[1401.54s -> 1405.67s]  another job. I'm not. I can't make a decision.
[1405.67s -> 1408.79s]  Talk to the chief whenever you complete part of the castle.
[1408.79s -> 1414.02s]  Should we have something new for you to build? No the question. Why do you
[1414.02s -> 1416.66s]  guys hate this game? When I told you I was playing Mario Maker 2 it was
[1416.66s -> 1421.86s]  like oh oh oh really?
[1421.86s -> 1431.96s]  Let's do this one. There's one guy. No it was at least three.
[1431.96s -> 1435.08s]  How many are there? Like 3,000 people there? At least three of you. Sorry that's
[1435.08s -> 1439.24s]  like that's 10 percent. Well that's like 0.1 that's 0.01
[1439.24s -> 1446.38s]  percent. So that's like pretty I mean that I mean that's as much
[1446.38s -> 1451.37s]  that was you. No. Hold on. Today in the desert expect clear skies all day
[1451.37s -> 1454.49s]  with a chance of solar flares. There's an excessive heat warning in
[1454.49s -> 1457.61s]  effect from sunrise to sunset. So don't forget to slather on a thick
[1457.61s -> 1459.85s]  layer of sunscreen before stepping outdoors.
[1459.85s -> 1464.26s]  Either that or find a propeller and press R to avoid the burn.
[1464.26s -> 1473.66s]  Cool. The angry sun level is tricky. Time to be a god gamer.
[1473.66s -> 1477.74s]  All right which one is R? I haven't played this switch in like a year.
[1477.74s -> 1490.14s]  That's not it. That's not it. It actually flies down at you too. I'll
[1490.14s -> 1499.37s]  get it. I remember this from Mario 3. What's this thing? I've got like a
[1499.37s -> 1502.97s]  bozo hat on? Oh right and now I've seen this
[1503.05s -> 1514.01s]  before. I know what this one's like. How's this tricky? Oh wait it is
[1514.01s -> 1517.58s]  gonna get tricky here. Come on come on. This is part of the
[1517.58s -> 1523.11s]  secret up here or something. There's like a super coin up there.
[1523.11s -> 1533.58s]  It's not even tricky. Shit. No no I need that.
[1533.58s -> 1544.39s]  There's 10 in there. It's a distraction. Oh god.
[1544.39s -> 1552.76s]  Thank god I got the fucking oh shit. No and I okay I bumped my desk and it
[1552.76s -> 1558.38s]  did that. Oh my god it bumped the desk. My fat
[1558.38s -> 1563.10s]  like stomach leaned forward and hit L. That was not hard. Why are
[1563.10s -> 1576.94s]  you freaking me out? All right now I got enough. I'm
[1576.94s -> 1584.79s]  gonna do the middle. Let's do the expensive one first.
[1584.79s -> 1592.22s]  Miss 10 coins. It's okay. I'm all right with missing a few coins.
[1592.22s -> 1598.17s]  Let's do the middle. You sure about this? I'm sure.
[1598.17s -> 1606.01s]  Don't even build the left and right side. Just have a big cylinder in the
[1606.01s -> 1614.73s]  middle. Main hall first floor. Red Toad is heading up the project.
[1614.73s -> 1622.74s]  We've got the construction covered. Just get out there and complete more jobs.
[1622.74s -> 1633.85s]  I kind of love this. Is that weird? You can flip pages in the jobs list
[1633.85s -> 1637.77s]  with L and R and you can look for a list of incomplete jobs by pressing
[1637.77s -> 1644.06s]  Y. Back to work. New jobs are in. All right hold on.
[1644.06s -> 1648.62s]  The mystery of the haunted manor. Swinging claw ropes course.
[1648.62s -> 1655.16s]  The key master. This game is perfect for my
[1655.16s -> 1660.44s]  ADHD brain because I don't have to play any of the other Mario games.
[1660.44s -> 1665.37s]  They're all here. This is a shitload of levels that are every single Mario
[1665.37s -> 1667.85s]  game. Why would I need to play any of the other ones?
[1667.85s -> 1678.50s]  Let's try this one. So I made a ghost house recently but I think I got a
[1678.50s -> 1682.18s]  bit over my head because I'm kind of sort of trapped in here.
[1682.18s -> 1684.42s]  Should be able to get up with something strange about this place.
[1684.42s -> 1688.95s]  Can someone come and help me? All right here we go. This one's a
[1688.99s -> 1698.87s]  two-star. It's too hard.
[1699.59s -> 1708.07s]  It might be. See this is great. Now hold on a minute here. It's a
[1708.07s -> 1710.87s]  ghost level so I'm going to be deceived.
[1710.87s -> 1719.77s]  Isn't there a kid you do like the spin jump thing with big Mario?
[1719.77s -> 1728.14s]  They're like what? Yeah there it is. No I shouldn't be doing this
[1728.14s -> 1740.73s]  because those are going to turn to coins. Can you pick up the turnips?
[1740.73s -> 1746.18s]  Yeah you can. All right hold up. What does this mean?
[1746.18s -> 1754.38s]  You can't. What? Oh it's the first time I'm with Yoshi.
[1754.38s -> 1779.05s]  Oh stop it. Go up. You can just jump off Yoshi right?
[1779.05s -> 1787.80s]  Just eat them all. I can't eat that. He's dead.
[1787.80s -> 1802.82s]  Oops. Quick get over there quick. I can't jump on his head?
[1802.82s -> 1823.21s]  Why not? It's a ghost. Wait just take the other one.
[1823.21s -> 1827.29s]  That's different for some reason. Oh so I'm not crazy.
[1827.29s -> 1834.10s]  Good to know. All right let's eat. I already know how this works.
[1834.10s -> 1839.80s]  Don't worry everybody. I know how to do this.
[1839.80s -> 1856.58s]  See give me a break. I can do the two-star level.
[1856.58s -> 1865.53s]  But this is different. Okay oh I don't want to do this one.
[1865.53s -> 1872.04s]  Um hold on let's go in the door. What the fuck was that?
[1872.04s -> 1879.98s]  That actually scared the shit out of me. All right why is this
[1879.98s -> 1901.96s]  P.T. Mario? Oh god. Oh god. Oh fuck. Now what? Oh I have to reset it.
[1903.48s -> 1915.59s]  Lisa get me up here. Wait hold on. Um I want to get
[1915.59s -> 1920.41s]  there's another P. But should I? Is this going to take me out to the?
[1920.41s -> 1931.29s]  Hold on. Let's go. All right I've unlocked everything. What was this?
[1931.29s -> 1935.69s]  What's the P? Oh wait. Oh oh.
[1935.69s -> 1947.29s]  Okay. No stay on Yoshi. Oh oh oh oh oh.
[1947.29s -> 1954.07s]  What does this one do? I want to go in the P door.
[1954.07s -> 1979.22s]  I want those 30 coins. Check this out. You're going too slow.
[1979.22s -> 1998.44s]  Do I get out of here? Can I not be on Yoshi? Oh I think that's it right?
[1998.44s -> 2006.74s]  Yeah. I'm not soft locked. I'm fine. Now that I did that.
[2006.74s -> 2015.70s]  Now we. But wait. What's. Am I gonna get a P?
[2015.70s -> 2019.22s]  Now I could have brought a P with me probably. But what about this door?
[2019.22s -> 2051.83s]  Why have. I don't understand why I have that door. That hurt my ears. I'm sorry.
[2051.83s -> 2055.91s]  I'm sorry. Yeah that was really fucking loud.
[2055.91s -> 2059.67s]  I just. I'm sorry about that. But I mean that was a times 10.
[2059.67s -> 2071.90s]  Sometimes you have to scream. How we doing? Need more? More coins?
[2071.90s -> 2076.62s]  I did peek the mic. There's people that have been asking about that for
[2076.62s -> 2087.35s]  like six months. You got it. All right. This one's easy.
[2087.35s -> 2093.37s]  We rebuild the castle. What if. What if this is the whole stream?
[2093.37s -> 2106.46s]  Right? This is hard. I buried some coins in an underground room.
[2106.46s -> 2111.48s]  What do I care? Coins mean nothing to me anymore. What do we think about it?
[2111.48s -> 2113.96s]  All right. Reach the goal after grabbing all 30 coins.
[2113.96s -> 2124.57s]  I have to get all 30 coins. Reach the goal after grabbing all. I don't
[2124.57s -> 2130.84s]  have a hat anymore? Reach the goal after grabbing all 30.
[2130.92s -> 2134.36s]  Well I can tell you right now. Look at my brain just working.
[2134.36s -> 2138.34s]  Look at how good this brain is. There's gonna be one up here that they don't
[2138.34s -> 2144.70s]  tell you about. All right. These are all things I
[2144.70s -> 2147.50s]  didn't even know you could do in Mario.
[2147.50s -> 2156.38s]  What's this weird top thing? His brain.
[2156.70s -> 2166.06s]  Oh! This is just like the old game. Remember that old game?
[2166.06s -> 2184.52s]  I can't believe I just got fucking reverse Pac-Man. God damn it.
[2184.52s -> 2187.40s]  All right. Now I know what's going on. Now I know that the hat. Wait. There's
[2187.40s -> 2190.60s]  only one. I'm not taking it. I'm gonna need it
[2190.60s -> 2204.15s]  eventually. For the lobsters? Used to do this to the lobsters. Yep.
[2204.15s -> 2211.90s]  And they never brought that enemy back. They never brought back the weird
[2211.90s -> 2216.26s]  crab lobster things. Oh god damn it. I didn't want to do
[2216.26s -> 2230.34s]  that. Don't do it again! I've stopped
[2230.34s -> 2237.85s]  screaming. Fuck. I gotta put like a limiter on my
[2237.85s -> 2241.21s]  voice. No. Let's not kill every enemy.
[2241.21s -> 2251.32s]  Just collect all coins. Oh that's why I need the uh
[2251.32s -> 2256.36s]  that's why I need the star. Uh oh. Tricky.
[2256.36s -> 2262.76s]  Where they going? Tricky. Why would I go in this one?
[2262.76s -> 2274.57s]  Just an illusion. Well who cares? I got you coins.
[2274.57s -> 2291.90s]  Kick him over here. No. He's gonna. Oh.
[2291.90s -> 2299.96s]  Where's it going? Oh! I can't do it. I'm so. Holy shit. I almost died.
[2299.96s -> 2314.44s]  Just give me the coin and get me out. 30. I win, right?
[2314.44s -> 2342.15s]  Secrets. Got it. No. I'm not doing left and right. We're going straight up.
[2342.15s -> 2346.50s]  I'm doing main hall four and then main hall
[2346.50s -> 2355.98s]  two f. So you can do any amount of them, right? You can do a million of
[2355.98s -> 2359.98s]  them if you want. All right. Swimming claw ropes.
[2359.98s -> 2364.10s]  Oops. I should have read that. No. But everyone. That's all right.
[2364.10s -> 2368.26s]  That was unsatisfying what I just did. It was very satisfying.
[2368.26s -> 2378.55s]  And this is original Cake Mario. There it is.
[2378.55s -> 2382.07s]  There's Cake Mario. I knew I was gonna see it eventually.
[2382.07s -> 2405.43s]  Didn't get it. Whoa! Sorry. How did I get past?
[2405.43s -> 2412.62s]  No. No. No. I want those coins. I need the coins to build the castle.
[2412.62s -> 2423.82s]  I get itched my face. Wait. I think I needed those uh turtles.
[2423.82s -> 2430.89s]  Can I respawn them? Yeah. I need the turtles for that one.
[2430.89s -> 2435.66s]  Like you can't wall jump in this one. Do with no balls.
[2435.66s -> 2450.57s]  Why would I just die? Send me back. Send me put. Send me back. Send me back.
[2450.57s -> 2456.66s]  Send me back. I can get it.
[2469.16s -> 2483.85s]  Yes. I can feel every single one of those.
[2483.85s -> 2495.58s]  I'm not gonna spend any of it. I'm gonna wait till I get to 10 grand.
[2495.58s -> 2506.41s]  I'm gonna put it on one hand of blackjack. Wait. What did she say?
[2506.41s -> 2512.46s]  We got work to do. Yeah. I know. You want jobs? I got jobs.
[2512.46s -> 2517.26s]  Shoestopper. These shoe goompas are too much but the kicks they are rocking are
[2517.26s -> 2521.10s]  useful because you can walk over spike traps.
[2521.10s -> 2523.82s]  The shoes probably don't smell great but you can always press R to take them
[2523.82s -> 2527.74s]  off and if you find a big shoe you can always slam down by tilting
[2527.74s -> 2545.03s]  down in the air. Oh that's a cool snow level.
[2545.03s -> 2573.85s]  Oh it's a song from Undertale. Bean Bag Mario.
[2573.85s -> 2581.38s]  I tried. I thought I could get it. I got greedy.
[2581.46s -> 2584.34s]  What I just did right there is the equivalent of staying in and swinging one
[2584.34s -> 2587.06s]  more time in Dark Souls and knowing it's a bad idea but you
[2587.06s -> 2593.14s]  still gonna try it no matter what. See? Like I did it again.
[2593.14s -> 2613.75s]  I need another shoe. Thank you. Bean Bag
[2613.75s -> 2616.55s]  Mario and Bean Bag Sonic should be friends. That's what somebody said I
[2616.55s -> 2626.18s]  think or something like that. I'm paraphrasing.
[2626.18s -> 2629.62s]  Whoa. Why does it crashed into that guy?
[2629.62s -> 2635.38s]  There's a big shoe. Give me the big shoe. I can't get in the big one?
[2635.38s -> 2640.84s]  Yes I can. I can't get in the giant shoe tank. Of
[2640.84s -> 2654.70s]  course I can. What happened there? Well that was one
[2654.70s -> 2656.94s]  pixel that I didn't get on that. Wait hold on.
[2656.94s -> 2665.94s]  Can I? I'm too big. I need a little shoe. Any more little shoes?
[2665.94s -> 2671.16s]  Is this a giant high heel? All right hold on. Wait.
[2671.16s -> 2684.33s]  I need to get the giant heel. How do I get that?
[2684.33s -> 2694.71s]  Oh shit. Oh shit. I need to get in there.
[2694.71s -> 2698.20s]  How does one get in there?
[2708.39s -> 2712.70s]  I don't know why I'm so paranoid to jump on these guys. I can I can jump on
[2712.70s -> 2718.23s]  those guys right? It was the flame that hit me.
[2718.23s -> 2722.55s]  Yeah all right. All right I gotta do this.
[2722.55s -> 2724.95s]  Ready?
[2726.71s -> 2733.94s]  I feel like I'm playing Joust right now and I don't like it. It's making
[2733.94s -> 2745.51s]  me feel panicky. Shit I needed that. No not
[2745.51s -> 2758.09s]  anymore. I should have jumped out. What am I doing?
[2758.09s -> 2777.70s]  Go back. You can't get them all. All right first hall.
[2777.70s -> 2788.17s]  First main hall first floor is done. How much is the second one?
[2788.17s -> 2798.73s]  Cool. Wait you got a new building right?
[2798.73s -> 2803.53s]  Looking good. Go chief. Oh right you can press R to see the whole castle.
[2803.53s -> 2810.44s]  We have new building options now. Yep.
[2810.44s -> 2822.87s]  1200. I'm almost out of jobs. What happens when all the jobs
[2822.87s -> 2828.81s]  go away? So I made a ghost house. I'll pay anyone who can make it to the end.
[2828.81s -> 2833.29s]  Here's a little hint. You'll need four keys. More if you want to get the true
[2833.29s -> 2837.99s]  ending. Wink.
[2837.99s -> 2844.89s]  So I need more keys to get the true ending. I gotta try to get the true
[2844.89s -> 2855.30s]  ending. A little horn. All right well this
[2855.30s -> 2862.71s]  one key. I can't get it right now. So we've
[2862.71s -> 2871.16s]  got options here. We've got our spring which. Do I have to bring
[2871.16s -> 2877.38s]  it somewhere? I mean I don't know. There's nothing in
[2877.38s -> 2881.22s]  here. It's probably hit. I just fucked myself
[2881.22s -> 2885.77s]  completely. Can I like even get out of here without him killing me?
[2885.77s -> 2890.52s]  No. Look that pixel was bullshit. Did you see that?
[2890.52s -> 2901.93s]  What happened there? Oh really? I have to.
[2901.93s -> 2911.10s]  I need to get bigger. Hold on. Can I make it all the way back and grab the
[2911.10s -> 2926.41s]  thing? Yes there it is. Found it.
[2926.41s -> 2940.82s]  Ding dong. Three keys. Now what's in the other one? I need a
[2940.82s -> 2944.50s]  POW. I'm gonna take a guess and say the POW is gonna go in this one.
[2944.50s -> 2953.10s]  This one. This one right here. I don't know.
[2953.10s -> 2964.97s]  Well I kicked it. How do I get a secret key in here?
[2964.97s -> 2977.38s]  Spring? Well give me the POW. That's gonna get me killed. Just get in
[2977.38s -> 2980.90s]  there. Get in there. Oh they have melted
[2980.90s -> 2998.52s]  ghost snow. All right I didn't even need this.
[2998.52s -> 3004.52s]  I don't know why but I thought there was fall damage for a second. So there's
[3004.52s -> 3012.06s]  the one on the other side. A couple more. This one I don't
[3012.06s -> 3021.32s]  know. I think that's it. I think it did it.
[3021.32s -> 3030.28s]  Oh no it didn't. But that's the right place.
[3030.28s -> 3036.07s]  Get a mushroom? No I live dangerously. I'm gonna do it without a mushroom.
[3036.07s -> 3052.73s]  That's too much time. Oh fuck I should have listened.
[3052.73s -> 3060.47s]  All right I'm gonna get a mushroom. This is gonna freaking me out.
[3060.47s -> 3065.56s]  You're right. I need to get a mushroom. You're correct. I know. I'm gonna I'm
[3065.56s -> 3075.27s]  gonna listen. Just give one to me. So there's the
[3075.27s -> 3078.07s]  fourth key right there which is the P but I'm not doing that because I
[3078.07s -> 3081.96s]  wanted to get the true ending. So we need to bring the spring
[3081.96s -> 3090.70s]  somewhere. Where I did it? Over here? What is it like in here?
[3090.70s -> 3099.21s]  Yeah there we go. I need to get you. This is like a
[3099.21s -> 3102.89s]  you fly up. So how do I move you over there?
[3102.89s -> 3122.66s]  How do I get you to move? Is it an enemy? No it's not an enemy. Okay.
[3122.66s -> 3138.62s]  Wait will he actually? No give this to me.
[3138.62s -> 3141.74s]  No I want it to be no. Give it put it down here.
[3141.74s -> 3151.11s]  There we go. All right I got the five keys. No I don't. Not yet.
[3151.11s -> 3174.41s]  What? Get up there. Why is it? What? Am I insane? All right I got them all.
[3174.41s -> 3186.84s]  The fifth key is there and I get the secret ending.
[3186.84s -> 3193.27s]  Five. Out the door. Two. Three. Four. Five.
[3193.27s -> 3214.62s]  Two. Three. Four. Five. What do I do with the fifth one?
[3214.62s -> 3234.62s]  What? I need more keys? They said five.
[3234.62s -> 3240.04s]  No nobody said five. They said find more.
[3240.04s -> 3246.20s]  Four or more not five. There's so many that's a lot of
[3246.20s -> 3252.39s]  coins though. All right so what have I not used?
[3252.39s -> 3258.10s]  Do I need three more keys? I guess I didn't go
[3258.10s -> 3268.39s]  I didn't go on this. Let me look in here. Well this is obviously I need another I
[3268.39s -> 3272.49s]  need the spring here. And then we jump. I get it. Check this
[3272.49s -> 3280.10s]  out. Spring over on the left. Yeah I'm gonna jump from spring to
[3280.10s -> 3310.23s]  spring and I should get it. No I need this one over here. Everybody
[3310.23s -> 3326.28s]  thought I was stupid. Really? The intent was there. All
[3326.28s -> 3337.06s]  right now this is what about this one? I don't know it's the other one.
[3337.62s -> 3341.74s]  So how do I do this? The spring? The pow? No.
[3341.74s -> 3348.06s]  It's probably the spring. I have to like get on top of that.
[3348.06s -> 3351.85s]  Obviously I have to get on top of this. Oh shit.
[3351.85s -> 3357.91s]  Okay now I'm gonna hit a there's a secret block somewhere here and it's
[3357.91s -> 3362.31s]  probably gonna be like right here. Oh fuck. How about over here? Here?
[3362.31s -> 3375.50s]  Here? I'm gonna jump from the spring up. Oh god this is gonna kill me.
[3375.50s -> 3378.62s]  Hold on. I need a mushroom. I need to get a mushroom first. I'll
[3378.62s -> 3381.90s]  screw this up. What's that sound? What? Oh I have a
[3381.90s -> 3387.93s]  hundred seconds. I need one more. Where's the last one? Hold on give me
[3387.93s -> 3406.97s]  a mushroom. This one more. Where is it? It's the P. P right?
[3406.97s -> 3412.87s]  Hurry hurry go go go go. Did I get this one?
[3412.87s -> 3425.35s]  I already got this one. Wait what about what about if I'm
[3425.35s -> 3427.91s]  getting it's like uh Far Cry 4. You just have to go in the
[3427.91s -> 3460.60s]  beginning. Up there? No it's too late. It's too late. I don't have time.
[3460.60s -> 3464.65s]  Oh I have to come back and do this again? I got 40. No no I gotta go. Get
[3465.21s -> 3475.37s]  out of the way. That's a lot of coins but I don't I can't
[3475.37s -> 3483.94s]  I'm not I can't do it. Anything else in here? Just check in here.
[3483.94s -> 3508.34s]  Nothing else? Two, three, fuck. No just restarted? No I'm not going to
[3508.34s -> 3512.70s]  restart. I'm just gonna do it. I'm just gonna finish it. Use the
[3512.70s -> 3542.66s]  uh I feel so unfulfilled though. See I would have gone at zero but
[3542.66s -> 3546.74s]  I don't know in Mario specifically this one. Does it
[3546.74s -> 3558.62s]  kill you at zero or zero one die? I wasn't gonna take that risk.
[3558.62s -> 3567.67s]  Redo it. All right let's I'm gonna redo it.
[3567.67s -> 3576.97s]  So where's the where's the first one? I know how to get them all.
[3576.97s -> 3582.50s]  So I'll just get them all quick. This won't take very long.
[3582.50s -> 3589.88s]  I'm gonna start with POW. We're gonna go to the right up this one.
[3589.88s -> 3594.92s]  I have plenty of time. 500 seconds is like 12 minutes.
[3594.92s -> 3601.24s]  I got plenty of time.
[3609.34s -> 3612.46s]  Seven minutes. Yeah but whatever. It's enough time.
[3612.46s -> 3615.58s]  Give me the spring. I got springs over here.
[3615.58s -> 3620.22s]  Straight up this one. And I'm not gonna turn it in till I have I mean I
[3620.22s -> 3623.42s]  when I used to play Diablo 3 and I mean that game's not like that
[3623.42s -> 3626.22s]  great but when I used to do the bounties I
[3626.22s -> 3628.62s]  would collect the bounties and have like 10 of them and open them all
[3628.62s -> 3631.18s]  at the same time. I want to have all eight keys.
[3631.18s -> 3649.59s]  Oh my god he almost got me. Sometimes it would be 20.
[3649.59s -> 3666.98s]  I don't have time for this shit. Come on. Even Mario was looking at that going
[3666.98s -> 3675.13s]  like all right. All right that's all of them over here.
[3675.13s -> 3686.12s]  Get the P coins. You can be Luigi.
[3691.78s -> 3707.99s]  Wait is that a joke? I thought you were joking. I'm sorry.
[3707.99s -> 3728.47s]  I need this. Watch this. Ready? Wasn't that cool?
[3728.47s -> 3740.22s]  Could have been. Can I hit it like this? No.
[3740.22s -> 3743.50s]  There we go. But I still have to grab it. No I don't. It's free.
[3743.50s -> 3750.90s]  One two. I'm trying to count the keys. One two three. I only have five.
[3750.90s -> 3764.10s]  How did I get the other ones? Well there's one there. Right okay.
[3764.10s -> 3772.50s]  So that would be six. Oh yeah the conveyor room. Right.
[3772.50s -> 3788.26s]  Does this kill him? It does. Should have used it before.
[3788.26s -> 3791.46s]  All right look at all those bounty caches I got. Look at all those bounty
[3791.46s -> 3800.31s]  boxes. One two three four five six seven. One more. So let's see. I'm gonna say
[3800.31s -> 3812.07s]  no. There's one more. There's one there. I need I need to go find one more. Let's see
[3812.07s -> 3826.23s]  it up here. And there it is. What the hell do I do with this?
[3826.23s -> 3860.89s]  What's wrong with them? Is it a battery? Did I just give him like a
[3860.89s -> 3879.94s]  battery? Let's go. Oh my god. I'm gonna go up.
[3879.94s -> 3889.34s]  Got them all. All right. I just ripped his brain out. Have a nice life.
[3889.34s -> 3908.78s]  I did it. Now I get all those coins. And I got time to spare.
[3908.78s -> 3929.16s]  The good ending. The expensive ending. And yeah here's the anxiety music.
[3929.16s -> 3937.00s]  And why is it still on? Will the jack in the box come out already? I'm
[3937.00s -> 3957.82s]  waiting for him to pop out. And that was a nice little song. I have
[3957.82s -> 3963.64s]  to get these all.
[3969.22s -> 3978.97s]  Would that be there? Well uh why would that be there?
[3983.83s -> 3992.23s]  Oh god. Oh well. Oh all right. It's all right.
[3992.23s -> 3998.54s]  I can get them back. Those last three coins are just
[3998.54s -> 4011.00s]  trapped. You can't get them. Where did it go? What did I just throw it to?
[4011.00s -> 4025.40s]  What? I threw it. That's so dumb. At least you got the coins. Yeah and
[4025.40s -> 4028.52s]  then they all. This game's Sonic the Hedgehog's you.
[4028.52s -> 4047.51s]  You lose them all. Yeah it was for three coins.
[4047.51s -> 4063.72s]  Come here. I want it in here. Stop picking it up.
[4063.80s -> 4086.31s]  The POW. I really didn't think I was gonna be on this for this long.
[4086.31s -> 4089.91s]  Slow it down. I don't want to mess it up again. So and I didn't even mess it
[4089.91s -> 4100.39s]  up. I got trolled last time. So that doesn't count. Third first try.
[4101.43s -> 4115.58s]  Let's make this happen. Let's get the coins first.
[4120.20s -> 4132.31s]  Got it. All right then we just have to do the
[4132.31s -> 4137.51s]  throw. I'm just gonna take the POW. Let's do this one.
[4137.51s -> 4146.20s]  It's right here.
[4149.85s -> 4160.55s]  Get it. Now all we need is the pancake. All right that's it. Riders need the
[4160.55s -> 4176.17s]  this one here. He sounds annoyed. I'm not annoyed. Am I tall enough to
[4176.17s -> 4188.71s]  get this? It's one coin.
[4188.79s -> 4194.84s]  One two three four five six seven eight. The last one is up there.
[4194.84s -> 4202.36s]  This time I'm gonna bring the spring. I'm gonna go get a spring. Can I go get a
[4202.36s -> 4220.87s]  spring and put it here? Here we go. Come on down. You can keep
[4220.87s -> 4227.37s]  your brain this time. All right now I'm gonna bring the
[4227.37s -> 4238.79s]  spring up here. So let's hold on. Can I...
[4238.79s -> 4242.23s]  No I have to do this first. I gotta get the key. Come back.
[4242.23s -> 4246.23s]  Get the coins. All right. I can just step on it now.
[4246.23s -> 4261.03s]  All right. I'm ready. That's eight right? One two three four five six seven eight.
[4261.03s -> 4289.64s]  Hooray. All right up. Same deal. This time don't fall through the hole.
[4292.84s -> 4303.35s]  And I get to build this next part of the castle. It's worth doing.
[4303.35s -> 4326.36s]  Hey you get to hear the song again. Oh shit. Is there anything up there?
[4326.36s -> 4330.94s]  Oh I did it. It's still times 10. Times 10 is not even a big deal. Why did I
[4330.94s -> 4352.66s]  scream? Castle level two. Let's do it.
[4352.74s -> 4373.18s]  Bingo. You sure about this? I am sure. Nice. More jobs. More jobs. Six new jobs.
[4373.18s -> 4381.75s]  That's one hot car. Yo this fire junior clown car course that I made is off
[4381.75s -> 4384.71s]  the hook. Hold Y to charge up your cannon and
[4384.71s -> 4389.11s]  then let it go to fire a charge shot that can cook fools and bust hard
[4389.11s -> 4393.80s]  blocks. Press R to get out of the car. You
[4393.80s -> 4396.36s]  need to go down that. You need to go down a pipe at some
[4396.36s -> 4403.30s]  point. What? Is there an actual clown car level in
[4403.30s -> 4412.06s]  this game? Hold Y to charge. Oh it's not really a
[4412.06s -> 4425.11s]  real clown car. That felt good. Good coins.
[4425.11s -> 4445.82s]  Hey hey hey. Let's grab them. I can't get hurt down here.
[4445.82s -> 4448.06s]  I almost got hit by that bullet. I don't know why. I thought it was an
[4448.06s -> 4464.73s]  indicator. It's R to get out right? Touch it so
[4464.73s -> 4467.13s]  don't spritz it. All right I gotta get a pipe at some point right? But
[4467.13s -> 4470.01s]  wait not yet. There's probably something over here.
[4470.09s -> 4490.09s]  Too bad. I can. Oh that's cool. People are going to make some cool
[4490.09s -> 4500.92s]  shit with this. Definitely. Upgraded triple shot.
[4500.92s -> 4504.44s]  I cannot get rid of the cannons but yes I can.
[4504.44s -> 4513.14s]  Drop them in. I think it has made this harder for myself.
[4513.14s -> 4525.46s]  Kind of. Get it there. Go go go go. Get up.
[4525.46s -> 4537.38s]  You can make a bullet hell. Yeah. Shit. I tried to duck.
[4537.38s -> 4542.87s]  That's not going to work. Just get up. Oh my gosh. Standing in front of it.
[4542.87s -> 4591.50s]  All right into the cup. Touch the axe. Touch the axe. I did it.
[4591.50s -> 4599.35s]  Continue the build. You just just killed an entire castle so you could
[4599.35s -> 4609.99s]  build your own. My castle's not evil.
[4609.99s -> 4623.51s]  Swinging claws. Oh cool. Imperialism. No I'm this I'm taking out the evil
[4623.51s -> 4630.39s]  people. Oh I love when they do this style.
[4630.39s -> 4644.52s]  Makes me feel like I'm just working on a game boy.
[4644.52s -> 4647.96s]  Get over here goomba. I need to jump on you to get up there.
[4647.96s -> 4661.29s]  Oh god damn it. Come on. No pick him up. Pick up the goomba.
[4661.29s -> 4666.86s]  All right then I have to get close when he gets close enough. Don't do
[4666.86s -> 4671.18s]  that yet. No no. I want to drop him on that.
[4671.18s -> 4681.64s]  Because bullet that head would do something. Nice. There it is.
[4681.64s -> 4685.74s]  More claw games. All right then drop them here.
[4685.74s -> 4693.96s]  Oh shit. Hold on. All right then drop them here on this prize machine.
[4693.96s -> 4714.12s]  This is cool. This is innovative. Oh they you have
[4714.12s -> 4718.65s]  I get it. Pick him up and then you have to put him down here.
[4718.65s -> 4726.42s]  So oh god. All right hold on. Pick him up
[4726.42s -> 4734.25s]  and then place him over there. No get him.
[4734.25s -> 4738.26s]  Get somebody get him. He's he'll get him on the way back right there.
[4738.26s -> 4742.49s]  Right now. Got it. All right and then let it go.
[4742.49s -> 4755.29s]  You gonna pick me up? Oh wait wait wait wait. What's going on here?
[4755.29s -> 4761.50s]  And then you gotta drop him on there. Pick him up and then bring him this
[4761.58s -> 4776.20s]  way. Oh shit he died.
[4782.73s -> 4790.38s]  All right put him in that. Ding dong. Now you
[4790.38s -> 4793.88s]  I didn't think they were gonna come down here. Oh shit. I need to get in
[4793.88s -> 4798.07s]  that. All right now don't die here. Are
[4798.07s -> 4813.48s]  those. Does this flappy bird shit kill you? No.
[4813.48s -> 4826.17s]  That was cute. That was a cute one. Two more levels and I can get. It's
[4826.17s -> 4835.50s]  probably gonna be way too much money. Tree top fireballs. I managed to plant
[4835.50s -> 4837.82s]  some trees and they actually look pretty good.
[4837.82s -> 4851.13s]  Can you try climbing all 12 of my trees? Yes I can.
[4851.13s -> 4856.15s]  Do the harder ones? Well I want to just get them all done. I'm just doing it as
[4856.15s -> 4863.94s]  they come. Climb on the trees. One. The snow comes off too. They've
[4863.94s -> 4876.68s]  thought of everything. I don't know. I don't know what
[4876.68s -> 4886.97s]  that does but whatever. Is that gonna hurt me? No it's
[4886.97s -> 4904.33s]  just there. One more trees.
[4907.38s -> 4921.46s]  Only one to kill that guy. It's usually like six.
[4921.46s -> 4940.78s]  Oh all right. They give me a nice little break.
[4940.78s -> 4948.09s]  Burning the locals to death. I mean are these.
[4948.09s -> 4952.01s]  They're they're killing us. They're trying to kill me.
[4952.01s -> 4971.13s]  No they're not. They're kind of not at all.
[4971.13s -> 4998.66s]  How's this not 12? Did I miss one? Oh it's right here okay. What just. I
[4998.66s -> 5002.74s]  was. You can climb the hole and all right. I got a pretty good score
[5002.74s -> 5017.26s]  regardless. 174 dollars. All right one more and then I'm
[5017.26s -> 5020.30s]  gonna find out if I don't have enough money.
[5020.30s -> 5026.95s]  We'll find out real quick. Plenty of cheap cheeps in the sea. This swimming
[5026.95s -> 5032.44s]  level is gonna be horrible. There's way too many cheap cheeps.
[5032.44s -> 5038.15s]  Is it even possible to beat this? Someone help me.
[5038.15s -> 5041.03s]  Well sorry. Well Toad you have to be able to beat your own level before
[5041.03s -> 5044.76s]  you put it up here. So you had to have already beaten
[5044.84s -> 5059.37s]  this. Nice lie. Oh it's a water level. Might as well skip it.
[5059.37s -> 5062.74s]  I hate these water levels. I don't have the kind of control that I'm looking
[5062.74s -> 5067.98s]  for. The exact precision that I want. It always causes me a huge problem.
[5067.98s -> 5080.94s]  Although this is not that hard. Nobody likes water levels. No.
[5080.94s -> 5091.34s]  Oh no. No. No. It's like timed. I thought that was a mushrooms output to
[5091.34s -> 5106.07s]  grab one. Okay good. Wasn't that bad. Wasn't
[5106.07s -> 5110.34s]  as bad as I made it out to seem like.
[5110.34s -> 5115.10s]  Timed underwater escort mission. Yep. Oh there's the tweedle dees. Whatever
[5115.10s -> 5117.82s]  they're called. What are those actual caterpillar things
[5117.82s -> 5153.13s]  called? Oh got it. Mario time. The wiggles.
[5153.13s -> 5176.60s]  There it is. Now let's do middle hall three.
[5176.60s -> 5180.36s]  It's so beautiful. Keep up the good work. We're gonna try.
[5180.36s -> 5183.40s]  Oh I have to do something else now. I got the money to do it. Let's do
[5183.40s -> 5193.90s]  west hall. Can't just go straight up. Sorry. I
[5193.90s -> 5196.14s]  also have enough money to do these tall as well.
[5196.22s -> 5223.40s]  Doing both. We get more jobs. Six new jobs. Six new jobs. Six new jobs.
[5223.40s -> 5227.80s]  Something about this is just actually very very satisfying to play.
[5227.80s -> 5231.32s]  All right so let's do let's do a hard one.
[5231.32s -> 5234.44s]  This is a hard one. No jumping allowed.
[5234.44s -> 5237.08s]  Here's a challenge. Try to get through the whole level without jumping
[5237.08s -> 5240.60s]  off the ground and landing. Any takers anyone. There's a prize for
[5240.60s -> 5244.76s]  anyone who succeeds. Here's a hint. Use y to dash.
[5244.76s -> 5255.45s]  The game master. I can't jump. Reach the goal without landing after
[5255.45s -> 5263.72s]  leaving the ground. So wait. What do you mean without
[5263.72s -> 5267.56s]  landing after leaving the ground? Does that count if I land up there?
[5267.56s -> 5277.16s]  If I land up top there does it count? I didn't even make it fucking ten
[5277.16s -> 5291.59s]  steps. I was trying to. Whoa no! I gotta
[5291.59s -> 5299.75s]  I gotta get my fucking brain. No I don't need to be Luigi. Don't
[5299.75s -> 5306.73s]  worry. What the fuck? I thought he was gonna go
[5306.73s -> 5311.48s]  down. Oh my god. I'm gonna lose all my characters.
[5311.48s -> 5315.78s]  I thought he was gonna go down into the ground after passing once.
[5315.78s -> 5334.98s]  Oh no. Here he comes. Wait. Does that count?
[5334.98s -> 5337.94s]  That doesn't count right? Because I'm not touching the ground. That's
[5337.94s -> 5340.18s]  that's a that's a donut. That's not a ground.
[5340.18s -> 5371.21s]  Okay. Oh shit. All right. Give me a flag.
[5371.21s -> 5378.01s]  Do they have a platform? I can't go. I don't want to go down.
[5378.01s -> 5392.33s]  Fuck. Do I have to stand on that? Oh my god.
[5392.33s -> 5400.04s]  What happens if I run out of lives? What happens if I run out? Does anyone know?
[5400.04s -> 5422.09s]  You save gets deleted. False.
[5422.09s -> 5429.67s]  You get reincarnated as an ant. Oh interesting.
[5429.67s -> 5441.90s]  Come on down. What are they shooting? All right that just freaked me out. Now
[5441.90s -> 5445.42s]  this is important. So let me watch him. I need to see
[5445.42s -> 5449.51s]  where he goes. He runs over here and that I didn't even
[5449.51s -> 5452.47s]  move. I didn't even I didn't even fucking move.
[5452.47s -> 5463.16s]  Okay that it freaked me out. What happens if I
[5463.16s -> 5474.63s]  I didn't even move. I have to complete this. No I can't.
[5474.63s -> 5488.17s]  Tape the button down. Too bad. Do I lose the game? Do I did I just lose?
[5488.17s -> 5500.82s]  He can do it for you. Do we get to watch him play it?
[5500.82s -> 5509.53s]  I hope it's actually a cell phone call. Hope you actually call him.
[5525.22s -> 5530.25s]  Hello. Hey can you help me beat this level?
[5530.25s -> 5544.02s]  I'm in traffic right now. Stop fucking calling me. Oh shit.
[5544.02s -> 5558.82s]  I didn't jump. Everybody gets a one. You call it 15 times.
[5558.82s -> 5567.80s]  The game just launched. Maybe you should try
[5567.80s -> 5592.12s]  What is that game? Candy Crush. Okay I'm I don't understand this. Here we go.
[5592.12s -> 5595.88s]  I don't understand it. I don't understand it. I don't understand it.
[5595.88s -> 5601.59s]  Yeah I have to use the draw. I'm gonna let him do it.
[5601.59s -> 5605.88s]  I'm gonna call Luigi. I'm gonna say like hurry home from work.
[5605.88s -> 5611.14s]  I need you to beat a level for me. I just stand still as I did the last
[5611.14s -> 5631.96s]  time and I fell off his head and it discounted me.
[5631.96s -> 5634.76s]  All right I'm gonna do it this time. I'm not fucking this up. I'm just gonna stand
[5634.76s -> 5653.19s]  still on his head. Come on booze let's go. What now what?
[5653.19s -> 5691.18s]  Hurry they're coming. What do I do about this? What happened?
[5691.18s -> 5695.93s]  You went into the air. I didn't go in the air. I didn't go in the
[5695.93s -> 5713.82s]  Did I already lose? I gotta call Luigi.
[5713.82s -> 5736.18s]  What was that? What happened? What happened?
[5736.18s -> 5747.80s]  Let me try again. Hi this is Luigi. Mama mia call me back at a later date.
[5747.80s -> 5758.01s]  Take a message. What happened? I could just call him. What's going on?
[5758.01s -> 5771.66s]  I can't. He has to do it. I can't. I have to press I have I can't do it.
[5771.66s -> 5775.42s]  This task is too much for me to do. It really is. I just can't do it. I'm
[5775.42s -> 5777.26s]  like I'm like looking over at chat and I'm
[5777.26s -> 5780.62s]  like fucking falling off the ground. I can't do it. I can't. I can do it.
[5780.62s -> 5792.14s]  I'll do it. Guys I can't. Luigi I can't call Luigi anymore.
[5792.14s -> 5795.42s]  He called up Verizon and had my number fucking blocked
[5795.42s -> 5827.42s]  permanently. Okay so what happened here?
[5827.42s -> 5833.99s]  Just stand on it and just let it... I walked off.
[5833.99s -> 5839.05s]  Give me a break. There's even more of this shit.
[5839.05s -> 5882.81s]  Now what? Get up. What's over here? Should I let this pick me up? I
[5882.81s -> 5892.63s]  wasn't fast enough. I need to watch this for a minute.
[5892.71s -> 5917.93s]  Two. Two. How do I get that? Will the bomb blow it up?
[5917.93s -> 5929.80s]  They can disappear. What's the purpose of that? That has to be a purpose of
[5929.80s -> 5933.86s]  what you're doing there. The donuts just walk across the
[5933.86s -> 5939.69s]  donuts? Do I bounce on the donuts? I've never seen the donuts before.
[5939.69s -> 5943.13s]  What the fuck was that? It's lots of slipperiness there.
[5943.13s -> 5962.04s]  Does this count if I go through this? Am I gonna land on something?
[5962.04s -> 5982.25s]  Oh shit um do I have to direct him here? I don't dude I don't care about the
[5982.25s -> 6018.46s]  coins anymore. I almost just pressed jump.
[6018.46s -> 6037.93s]  That was kind of hard. I have to do both at the same time. Mental breakdown? No.
[6037.93s -> 6043.40s]  Not yet. What else we got for jobs? We got fire koopa clown carnage.
[6043.40s -> 6057.58s]  Uh yep. Ask again in a few hours? Yeah. Ask again in a few hours. We'll
[6057.58s -> 6062.09s]  see if I can be the first person on twitch to complete this.
[6062.09s -> 6066.65s]  Um the game's been out for like 12 hours. I don't think that's gonna be
[6066.65s -> 6077.51s]  the thing. I can jump again. What am I doing?
[6077.51s -> 6098.79s]  That's so burnt in my brain that I can't jump. He's been conditioned.
[6098.79s -> 6117.96s]  At this point yes. Spread out. Oops. Did I not kill these? What if I
[6117.96s -> 6133.32s]  should jump on them? They don't have a chance? Yeah they
[6133.32s -> 6142.60s]  shouldn't. Oh what does this do? Can I? Oh it's like an extra health bar
[6142.60s -> 6162.17s]  right? Yeah it's one extra hit. That thing comes off. Like that.
[6162.17s -> 6167.14s]  Like that. Good thing I had a hard head.
[6167.14s -> 6185.85s]  Boom. Get one up too. I'll take it.
[6187.29s -> 6190.65s]  This is dumb luck that I haven't been hit yet.
[6190.65s -> 6209.13s]  How fast does he go? Where the shit in the battle toads?
[6209.13s -> 6230.74s]  All right hold on. Slow down. Slow down. Slow slow slow. Oh fuck.
[6230.74s -> 6244.31s]  Watch out for that really slow moving arrow. Just get out and get it.
[6244.31s -> 6264.54s]  Oh shit. Hold on. Is it still there? Go back. Go back. Go back.
[6264.54s -> 6275.78s]  Need that spike helmet. Yeah that's true. That's sweet.
[6275.78s -> 6280.50s]  Double. One more job and then we'll be at probably what?
[6280.50s -> 6288.07s]  Somebody up there? Oh I can go in the castle. Oh this is cool.
[6288.07s -> 6295.06s]  What's going on up here? This is this is a regular toad.
[6295.06s -> 6300.86s]  I need your help. It'll be bad if the chief overhears.
[6300.86s -> 6307.77s]  Mutiny? Heavy stone heave ho. We went off a budget and ran out of stone
[6307.77s -> 6312.01s]  for making stairs. And of course the chief says we only
[6312.01s -> 6315.37s]  use stone from the desert. I'll do it myself but it's so heavy.
[6315.37s -> 6319.21s]  Could you bring me some? Reach the goal while holding a stone.
[6319.21s -> 6332.78s]  Let's go. Oh Mario cake. It's my favorite kind. It's my favorite Mario.
[6332.78s -> 6336.22s]  I gotta hold the stone the whole time. Whatever happens if I let it go.
[6336.22s -> 6339.56s]  I have to hold down this button the whole time which I get really sweaty
[6339.56s -> 6343.48s]  greasy hands. So this is gonna be hard to do.
[6343.48s -> 6375.24s]  Go here. Oh fuck. I could have got it.
[6375.24s -> 6402.22s]  I want that. How do I get that though? Okay well that was easier than I
[6402.22s -> 6406.68s]  thought it was gonna be. You can put the stone down. How do
[6406.68s -> 6414.02s]  you know that? I thought I'd wait I just had to
[6414.02s -> 6417.54s]  it's a left for dead gnome run. Only 17 coins.
[6417.54s -> 6423.88s]  You didn't try? I didn't want to lose any an extra life. I need those.
[6423.88s -> 6432.28s]  Okay so what was the oh that's it. Let's go.
[6432.28s -> 6447.99s]  25 percent? 30 percent? 26 more workers.
[6447.99s -> 6452.36s]  Mario we need some blocks to get to the east hall from here but
[6452.36s -> 6456.81s]  Mario can you keep a secret? Thanks and good luck.
[6457.64s -> 6465.80s]  What was the secret? That's the secret. Purple toad who makes the blocks hasn't
[6465.80s -> 6470.09s]  arrived yet. Got the schedule wrong management am I
[6470.09s -> 6472.57s]  right? Anyway please bring the purple toad
[6472.57s -> 6478.57s]  back here. Reach the goal with one toad in tow.
[6478.57s -> 6488.49s]  What do you mean in what do you mean toad in tow?
[6488.49s -> 6499.35s]  Where do I get this toad? I just realized something.
[6499.35s -> 6502.47s]  All these mushrooms you know because before it was just there was just the
[6502.47s -> 6506.15s]  one toad. Now there's a shitload of toads. This
[6506.15s -> 6509.78s]  toad's everywhere. Take a look at what the mushrooms in this
[6509.78s -> 6514.78s]  game look like. They look exactly like toad's head.
[6514.78s -> 6523.02s]  Think about that and we've we've come to learn that there are
[6523.02s -> 6526.38s]  hundreds if not like millions of toads.
[6526.38s -> 6544.22s]  Where the mushrooms come from? Look at them.
[6544.22s -> 6546.86s]  Look at this little his face and look at that toad face. Look at the
[6546.86s -> 6552.87s]  look at the mushroom. Somebody get the with those
[6552.87s -> 6556.31s]  theorists on the line.
[6556.47s -> 6572.90s]  Jump on top of them. Risky move risky play. Oh shit.
[6572.90s -> 6586.20s]  Risky move here. Shoot one more. Not gonna shoot another one.
[6586.20s -> 6591.99s]  Right at the bottom. One coin. Why is Yoshi born with shoes on?
[6591.99s -> 6608.55s]  Man that's kind of weird. I'm gonna have dreams about this shit.
[6608.55s -> 6622.26s]  How many more do I have to do that like three or four more times?
[6622.26s -> 6625.30s]  Well anything else you need me to do over here on the
[6625.30s -> 6633.29s]  rampart? Okay you didn't hear me say that. Oh I'm ready to start working
[6633.29s -> 6643.18s]  the rest of the east hall. Oh you have to. I see. Hello you.
[6643.18s -> 6648.25s]  We're gonna find a new toad. The chief took my cloud because she said
[6648.25s -> 6651.45s]  she needed it for something or other. I don't want the chief to hear this so
[6651.45s -> 6657.08s]  let me just whisper it in your ear. The chief asked me to get a Lakitu's
[6657.08s -> 6659.72s]  cloud for the west hall. Can you believe that?
[6659.72s -> 6663.00s]  Who asked someone to do something that they don't want to do themselves?
[6663.00s -> 6666.28s]  Oh hey can you go and get me a Lakitu's cloud Mario?
[6666.28s -> 6675.61s]  Comedy. I can't wait for like the glass door reviews
[6675.61s -> 6679.77s]  of rebuilding the magic kingdom. Whatever this is.
[6679.77s -> 6688.89s]  Oh I got my time. How much time do I have? Not very much time at all.
[6690.49s -> 6715.18s]  12 seconds. Four. There's a four up there.
[6715.18s -> 6726.04s]  I had four seconds left. What? Get out of here.
[6726.04s -> 6729.56s]  Blocked. What? I had four seconds left.
[6729.56s -> 6736.07s]  Oh my god. The cloud has its own timer so what's the extra three seconds for
[6736.07s -> 6749.66s]  on the clock? Why not just make it 12 seconds or 16 seconds?
[6755.24s -> 6772.55s]  Okay I made it over. It was so sloppy. Oh god damn it.
[6772.55s -> 6787.11s]  I kind of want to call Luigi. I want to know what it does.
[6787.11s -> 6801.21s]  I'm not calling him yet. It's really slippery in the cloud.
[6806.23s -> 6819.90s]  Oh my god I can't fucking do this. I was being so careful.
[6819.90s -> 6826.20s]  Oh oh all right just it's not even that big of a deal. I'm just freaking
[6826.20s -> 6830.46s]  out for no reason. Nobody can do anything with this music
[6830.46s -> 6834.34s]  on. They should make relaxing music here.
[6834.34s -> 6838.42s]  Like calm down music. Imagine if your boss was fucking
[6838.42s -> 6842.57s]  yelling at you to finish doing something.
[6842.57s -> 6851.53s]  You screwed that whole thing up Jacob.
[6851.53s -> 6854.17s]  You missed like two lines there. You gotta go back and fix it.
[6854.17s -> 6860.01s]  You gotta go back and fix it right now. Jacob fix it now.
[6860.01s -> 6864.17s]  Okay which line? Two lines down. It should say they
[6864.17s -> 6878.39s]  and plus six. Hurry the fuck up Jacob.
[6878.39s -> 6906.04s]  You had bad grammar. There was an extra T.
[6906.04s -> 6909.24s]  Oh hey I know that you're clocking out of work here in
[6909.24s -> 6912.44s]  like the next 30 seconds or so. Oh but can you make
[6912.44s -> 6916.36s]  we need six more hamburgers made right now. Go!
[6916.36s -> 6978.14s]  I'm gonna get it right now. Oh my god it's so floaty.
[6978.14s -> 7011.32s]  Whee! It's fucking easy. Thank you. I don't want to watch this every
[7011.32s -> 7024.02s]  time. Just let me jump on it. God Nintendo come on. The chief took
[7024.02s -> 7026.66s]  my cloud. Can't believe it. Don't tell the chief I said that.
[7026.74s -> 7032.10s]  Hello. I'm ready. 26 percent building the whole damn castle
[7032.10s -> 7036.10s]  today. Do you hear? What? What? I'm sorry. I
[7036.10s -> 7039.78s]  did my static. There's a little bit of frame drop there. What'd you say Jeremy?
[7039.78s -> 7054.79s]  Building the whole castle tonight. Snake blocks in the sky.
[7054.79s -> 7060.34s]  This is a 40 hour long campaign. Is it?
[7060.34s -> 7067.83s]  No it's not. Is it? It's not actually a 40 hour
[7067.83s -> 7077.82s]  campaign. I'm already like 30 percent of the way done. It's been two hours.
[7077.82s -> 7082.62s]  Two, four, six, eight. I'll do this like six and a half, eight hours.
[7082.62s -> 7086.12s]  I need to practice to be able to do the multiplayer levels. You think this
[7086.12s -> 7100.65s]  is the last Mario Maker 2 stream? Yes you think so.
[7100.65s -> 7107.34s]  Uh I don't know. It might be. I messed up.
[7107.34s -> 7120.82s]  How do I get that? I think I missed my opportunity to get it.
[7120.82s -> 7133.11s]  No I didn't. Hold on. It's all right. I do have a terrible record with
[7133.11s -> 7138.63s]  Mario games. Yeah. But correct me if I'm wrong. As of two
[7138.63s -> 7142.78s]  hours into the stream last Mario Maker stream,
[7142.78s -> 7145.98s]  I was already talking about... I was talking about problems with the
[7145.98s -> 7149.34s]  controller. So I got input lag right? And then it
[7149.34s -> 7156.55s]  was already like a huge problem. Remember? I remember that. That shit
[7156.55s -> 7163.43s]  was on the Wii U. The Wii U's controller. I was on like
[7163.43s -> 7166.23s]  the big brick controller. I don't think I even had the
[7166.23s -> 7178.62s]  the... Yeah. No. That's one of the reasons why.
[7178.62s -> 7186.63s]  And it was all stained and shit. I think I blew that opportunity. Do I have to ride
[7186.63s -> 7195.69s]  this? Wow. You can ride it? Don't crush my head!
[7195.69s -> 7205.45s]  Cool. This is fucking radical. Oh I thought I was gonna... I thought
[7205.45s -> 7221.75s]  I was gonna just shrink. I don't like this shit either. Like you
[7221.75s -> 7237.88s]  meant to get called into your boss's office in this place.
[7237.88s -> 7248.33s]  That just... That just murdered me. That double tapped me I think.
[7248.41s -> 7263.98s]  Get out of here. I don't need you. You can do that?
[7263.98s -> 7271.69s]  Why can I do that? I don't understand what the
[7271.69s -> 7294.18s]  purpose of that is quite at the moment. What's it for?
[7294.50s -> 7303.69s]  Watch out for the... Okay there it is. I can't see. Don't go forward.
[7303.69s -> 7314.52s]  What? That was gritty. I missed the flag.
[7314.52s -> 7330.52s]  Should I just... Wait. There's a pipe here.
[7330.52s -> 7350.15s]  Wait. That was... I don't know. I'm a weird cough.
[7350.15s -> 7353.24s]  I wanted to say something but I had nothing to say so that was my body's
[7353.24s -> 7367.77s]  instinctual response. It was just a cough. Did I die or he died?
[7367.77s -> 7387.78s]  I think he did. Yeah. How much money do I got? A thousand?
[7387.78s -> 7395.59s]  I think I can do some other builds here. What do you got for me?
[7395.59s -> 7398.87s]  Making great progress. This design is too perfect. Almost too perfect.
[7398.87s -> 7403.66s]  We have a new building option. Let's go with
[7403.66s -> 7420.78s]  West Hall, second floor. I am certain. Construction is underway. How big is this
[7420.78s -> 7425.14s]  castle? Square footage wise. Have they ever
[7425.14s -> 7430.46s]  released that information? Can you look up the Mario castle on
[7430.46s -> 7434.44s]  Zillow? That would be a cute idea. Don't you
[7434.44s -> 7441.34s]  think so? Imagine like Zillow or one of these other
[7441.34s -> 7444.22s]  places did a like oh this is not a good idea at all.
[7444.22s -> 7450.71s]  No one would use this and it'd be stupid. Never mind.
[7450.71s -> 7454.92s]  Twister. If you press B as you enter the twister you'll be thrown skywards.
[7454.92s -> 7462.97s]  Yeah I know. Twisting through the desert sands.
[7462.97s -> 7466.41s]  It could be a cute April Fools gag. Yeah I mean maybe.
[7466.41s -> 7470.66s]  You can scroll through photos of inside the castle and tell you how
[7470.66s -> 7473.62s]  many square footage it is and then you get to the price and you
[7473.62s -> 7478.50s]  go Mario how the fuck can you afford that?
[7478.50s -> 7487.26s]  And then you check the estimate. Find out what like your
[7487.26s -> 7494.57s]  mortgage estimate would be for Peach's castle.
[7494.57s -> 7498.65s]  $61,000 a month's estimate. I can't. I don't think I can live there.
[7498.65s -> 7537.05s]  That's it? Got it. Geez. Whoa whoa whoa easy. B. B.
[7537.05s -> 7557.66s]  Oh my god. Say the line. What line? Cake Mario?
[7557.66s -> 7581.46s]  Do I weigh enough to get this? I have to wait till it goes all the way to the other side.
[7581.46s -> 7642.82s]  Damn it. Not bad. 107 coins so far. I'm gonna run out of time though.
[7642.82s -> 7655.98s]  That felt pretty damn good. All right what's the cost for the other ones?
[7655.98s -> 7666.94s]  What's that thing over there? There's a number muncher over there. Why?
[7666.94s -> 7674.55s]  Looks like you've been hard at work. I suppose it's time I get back to work
[7674.55s -> 7685.11s]  myself. Adios. Mr. Eraser.
[7685.11s -> 7689.30s]  Sorry I'm gonna go chew on some prime numbers. I'll be back in a few
[7689.30s -> 7700.84s]  hours. Come on. That was cute. That was
[7700.84s -> 7714.87s]  cute. That was cute. From a split on that one. The way of the shell. Oh it
[7714.87s -> 7719.45s]  was the begone rotten mushroom. I bought some
[7719.45s -> 7723.43s]  mushrooms for a new recipe but I left them in the car and now they've rotten.
[7723.43s -> 7726.55s]  Rotten and vengeful. You're going to have to outrun them if you want the
[7726.55s -> 7739.08s]  reward. Begone rotten mushroom. Outrun the mushrooms.
[7739.08s -> 7751.54s]  This is a pretty awesome Halloween level. I did the joke before too.
[7751.54s -> 7753.86s]  Hold on. Let me do the same joke that I've done already like a
[7753.86s -> 7789.56s]  thousand times. Get out of my way for a second.
[7789.56s -> 7813.42s]  Mocking him. Whoa he can do that. He can't climb right? No. Can I block
[7813.42s -> 7846.36s]  him down here? No. Wait. Holy shit. Don't do that far.
[7846.36s -> 7850.70s]  You blew everything. You're making this. What?
[7850.70s -> 7882.84s]  How much money? 674. Need more coins. Where we at? Did I do all the
[7882.84s -> 7885.16s]  following? I got a lot to do down here.
[7885.16s -> 7894.22s]  Bonsai bill ambush. Guahaha. I've got an army of bonsai bills guarding
[7894.22s -> 7896.70s]  this place. Hoping to surprise Mario by sneaking up
[7896.70s -> 7899.02s]  behind him. Any of you chumps out there desperate
[7899.02s -> 7901.42s]  enough to test it before Mario shows up?
[7901.42s -> 7907.61s]  Get to the end and get paid. Good luck out there.
[7907.61s -> 7913.05s]  Go talk to the dog? I will after I get another thousand dollars.
[7913.05s -> 7925.05s]  Talk to the dog or I'm unsubbing. Just hold on.
[7925.05s -> 7941.53s]  Cat. I like the bullets in this. They're pretty cool. It's a nice touch.
[7941.53s -> 7944.57s]  Who made this? I made this. Oh they're cool.
[7944.57s -> 7948.39s]  I didn't know there was a get here.
[7948.71s -> 7958.02s]  What was going through your thought process? What the fuck just happened?
[7958.02s -> 7974.78s]  Oh. I had the checkpoint. I didn't press up.
[7974.78s -> 7991.35s]  Wait a minute. I can turn it around? Just let them destroy everything.
[7991.35s -> 8003.96s]  What? Oh wow. Missed coins. He missed coins. I don't- it's all right.
[8003.96s -> 8011.27s]  I had to jump on one of their heads to get this.
[8011.27s -> 8015.83s]  That guy down. I gotta get on the cloud. Did the cloud fall?
[8015.83s -> 8043.37s]  No. I can't just do this. Of course. This seems kind of out of place.
[8043.37s -> 8046.73s]  Fur suit. Guys, Mario has been wearing fur suits
[8046.73s -> 8064.54s]  for 25 years. This ain't new. Seasaw catapults. Jump and tilt
[8064.54s -> 8067.26s]  down to do a ground pound onto a seesaw to send anything on the other
[8067.26s -> 8069.74s]  end flying.
[8076.47s -> 8083.06s]  I love little cute Mario. What a perfect thing to have on a key chain.
[8083.06s -> 8089.72s]  Don't you think so? Or cake Mario. I think cake Mario I think is my
[8089.72s -> 8094.20s]  what I would put on a key chain. They definitely have it.
[8094.20s -> 8118.46s]  I don't pound this, but why would I ground pound any of this crap?
[8118.46s -> 8128.10s]  What? What's up with that? I just like was-
[8128.10s -> 8131.22s]  I just like broke his neck. I can't like sever his head. Like I can't
[8131.22s -> 8146.52s]  break his neck right there. Yeah right. I always thought you
[8146.52s -> 8148.44s]  couldn't kill that thing, but it just got angry.
[8148.44s -> 8155.03s]  Break that. I get it a lot. You know, the thing is
[8155.11s -> 8170.50s]  let's see if I can get that. Okay, hold on. Not quite.
[8170.50s -> 8178.10s]  Shit. All right, I gotta shut the fuck up. Wait, can I skip that?
[8178.10s -> 8190.70s]  He's gonna be squiggling around in there. There's probably a
[8190.70s -> 8195.40s]  coin over there. I'm gonna just give it a look. See, he
[8195.40s -> 8198.49s]  does get mad.
[8205.59s -> 8221.38s]  Whatever. It is bright here. It's fine. Whatever. It's 10 coins.
[8221.38s -> 8229.26s]  That's nothing. I thought I said I could launch him.
[8232.79s -> 8235.59s]  I can do it from the bottom.
[8240.81s -> 8244.73s]  Yeah, see? I'm not sure what that even did for me, but
[8244.73s -> 8248.17s]  I gotta get it. You're right. I'm looking in the chat right now. People
[8248.17s -> 8252.17s]  are just like, you fucking idiot. Stupid. Like, how dare you miss that?
[8252.17s -> 8260.79s]  And I'm like, geez. I mean, it's just Mario. It's
[8260.79s -> 8265.58s]  just Mario, guys. I'm done. Somebody said I hate you in all
[8265.58s -> 8269.45s]  capitals like 10 times in a row. Just like,
[8269.45s -> 8279.86s]  relax. It's all right. It's gonna be okay.
[8279.86s -> 8306.34s]  Just Mario. Just Mario. Ooh. Now, that was fun. Shit.
[8306.34s -> 8317.91s]  What am I? How do I do that? I'm gonna go from here to there to there.
[8317.91s -> 8323.35s]  What?! It's the buttons. The button. I fat-fingered it because I'm
[8323.35s -> 8328.34s]  using the Nintendo Switch. My thumb.
[8328.34s -> 8333.50s]  Using my thumb. Luigi, get out of my face.
[8333.50s -> 8336.30s]  The Switch. I'm using the Switch controller and sometimes when you
[8336.30s -> 8338.14s]  press one button on the Switch, you press
[8338.14s -> 8345.43s]  all of them because they're like sprinkles on your controller. It's like
[8345.43s -> 8348.15s]  having chocolate chips on your controller.
[8348.15s -> 8360.74s]  Sorry, I pressed all the chocolate chips at the same time.
[8360.74s -> 8375.30s]  I don't even have big hands. Yeah, I kind of do, but not that big.
[8375.30s -> 8406.95s]  If I fuck this up again. What's underneath this?
[8406.95s -> 8410.31s]  Sorry, I pressed every single little like dinner mint
[8410.31s -> 8418.04s]  at the same time. Look at those candy dots that were on the sheet of paper.
[8418.04s -> 8441.69s]  Those are bigger than the Switch buttons. Dog, dog. All right, all right, all right.
[8441.69s -> 8447.59s]  I'll talk to the dog. Bark, bark. I have jobs. Woof.
[8447.59s -> 8455.05s]  Woof, woof. Come on, please. Ooh, there's a dog level. Swinging claw escape.
[8455.05s -> 8457.69s]  Arf, Arf, I have a job for you to do. I keep getting caught by the
[8457.69s -> 8462.09s]  swinging claws hanging around my walking route. Could you show me a path
[8462.09s -> 8467.43s]  I can take to avoid getting grabbed? Reach the goal without using any
[8467.43s -> 8484.30s]  swinging claws. Who's a good boy?
[8484.30s -> 8490.44s]  Oh, okay. That just like freaked me the fuck out when I looked over there.
[8490.44s -> 8494.52s]  All right, don't get grabbed by any of these. I can jump though, right?
[8494.52s -> 8539.98s]  Just let that happen. Get grabbed.
[8540.06s -> 8552.62s]  Don't get grabbed. Slide. Wait. Okay, now slide.
[8552.94s -> 8567.10s]  Sure. Okay, that's fine.
[8567.58s -> 8573.51s]  It is a dog level, so it makes sense. I did the same thing again.
[8573.51s -> 8580.10s]  I just let it happen again. Like, sometimes I think
[8580.10s -> 8588.38s]  if you like split my head open, there'd be watermelon juice in there.
[8588.38s -> 8597.10s]  Like, sometimes I think it's just a coconut. Oh!
[8597.10s -> 8599.66s]  That was probably, that was so loud. I can tell. I looked over at the
[8599.66s -> 8611.10s]  monitor and it was really loud. Okay, I'm safe here, I think.
[8611.10s -> 8629.27s]  Where is the other ones? There's going to be another one.
[8629.27s -> 8635.22s]  See, the thing is, there was no point in me doing what I was just trying to do.
[8635.22s -> 8646.87s]  I, there was no point in that. I just had to go up. I don't know.
[8646.87s -> 8651.88s]  Don't do it again. If this happens again, I truly have
[8651.88s -> 8656.74s]  like orange juice in my brain. Remember those old
[8656.74s -> 8661.10s]  gushers commercials? They would eat the gushers and their heads would
[8661.10s -> 8679.22s]  turn into like pears and shit. Don't get grabbed.
[8679.22s -> 8692.34s]  Just kill me.
[8695.30s -> 8721.29s]  Does it start over button? I have to go down with the ship though.
[8721.29s -> 8729.14s]  Literally five coins. Do I really hear that much about it?
[8729.14s -> 8733.05s]  Don't even, don't even start talking shit about the jello. I, somebody said
[8733.05s -> 8736.81s]  jello and I got immediately angry. Hold on, I will
[8736.81s -> 8743.43s]  talk. No, I'm not talking about jello anymore.
[8743.43s -> 8748.07s]  Jello is jello. Jello is jelly. I can't even fucking believe it. I've
[8748.07s -> 8750.87s]  I'm already getting heated. I'm already getting like, I can feel my
[8750.87s -> 8763.26s]  like blood. Don't do that. Just get the thing.
[8763.26s -> 8769.74s]  Jelly is jello. Give me a break. Jelly is not always made with gelatin.
[8769.74s -> 8773.74s]  I can't even, I'm already getting mad. I can stop. Stop, stop. Just play.
[8773.74s -> 8794.50s]  Stop. You think I'm gonna go for two coins?
[8794.50s -> 8805.77s]  They respawn. Okay, wait. Go now. Drop it. Oh shit.
[8805.77s -> 8816.12s]  Home stretch. Don't blow it. I don't care if I didn't touch it.
[8816.12s -> 8820.76s]  Jelly is bones. No, jello is always made with gelatin. Jelly is not
[8820.76s -> 8824.65s]  always made with gelatin. Sometimes it's fruit preserves.
[8824.65s -> 8831.45s]  So therefore, chat was I-N-C-O-R-R-E-C-T.
[8831.45s -> 8849.40s]  Another job for the dog? Sure. When was the last time you guys tried to
[8849.40s -> 8855.45s]  spread jello on a piece of toast? Really?
[8855.45s -> 8864.26s]  What the, you can't, that's not gonna happen.
[8864.26s -> 8867.70s]  Arf, Arf, I have a job for you. The nights have been so cold lately.
[8867.70s -> 8870.50s]  Could you bring me something that will shelter me from the storm?
[8870.50s -> 8883.27s]  Reach the goal while wearing a dry bones shell.
[8883.27s -> 8901.42s]  If you spread jello on your toast. What? Hold on. What the fuck?
[8901.42s -> 8909.83s]  I didn't even get a chance. I can't see where we're going.
[8909.83s -> 8928.86s]  Oh, thank god his arrows. Oh boy. Okay. I think we're safe. Can I jump on these?
[8928.86s -> 8935.74s]  Yes, I can. Yes, I can. No, you can't. Yes, I can.
[8935.74s -> 8939.66s]  You can't. Yes, I can. Did you just watch? God.
[8939.66s -> 8947.18s]  What the fuck?
[8952.98s -> 8958.38s]  I'm gonna get it. He doesn't even want to take it. Get in the shell!
[8958.38s -> 8981.29s]  Get in the shell! What the hell? How is that even possible? This purple jello.
[8981.29s -> 8984.89s]  Ah, every time. I don't stop. Don't say that anymore.
[8984.89s -> 9005.61s]  Does he have a glass break? I'm cutting this way too close.
[9005.61s -> 9008.73s]  Like, honestly, I don't, I don't, I just, I don't care. I don't need to think
[9008.73s -> 9011.13s]  about this. I don't care about the world's most
[9011.13s -> 9016.25s]  disgusting snack. Like, who cares? The jello, jelly, who
[9016.25s -> 9028.63s]  cares? Doesn't matter. I, who, that doesn't matter. Who cares?
[9028.63s -> 9058.65s]  Got it. Oh, fuck. Um, should I go? Oh shit! I got it. Imagine being Mario
[9058.65s -> 9076.70s]  right now. What a nightmare. 87 coins. Cool.
[9076.70s -> 9081.16s]  I got enough money now. Is that it for the dog?
[9081.16s -> 9088.02s]  Ooh, I got him a dog house. He's got more. Should I just do all the dog missions?
[9088.02s -> 9097.77s]  No, I, we gotta start a build here. Looking glorious.
[9097.77s -> 9100.89s]  We have new building options now. Cool.
[9100.89s -> 9107.46s]  West hall cannon. Main hall three. Main hall three. Let's just get it done.
[9115.05s -> 9124.31s]  Do auto mission. I will. I'll do it right now.
[9124.31s -> 9131.93s]  Got another job. This is a full-on four star difficult. First time we've seen
[9131.93s -> 9135.05s]  it. Tonight, chain chomp chiller and I get something.
[9135.05s -> 9140.62s]  What do I get? A mystery t-shirt. The path I usually
[9140.62s -> 9143.66s]  take is littered with chain chomps. Could you show me if it's possible to
[9143.66s -> 9155.85s]  walk through there without jumping? Can't wait.
[9155.85s -> 9173.08s]  Get Luigi on speed dial for this one. I did it.
[9173.88s -> 9180.07s]  This is gonna suck. What? Wait. Does this one
[9180.07s -> 9193.82s]  fly? Some of them don't. Some of them go fly forward.
[9193.82s -> 9213.14s]  Oh no. No. How am I gonna? Okay. Just get me to a flag.
[9213.14s -> 9224.09s]  I don't know when to go. Right now. Okay, hold on.
[9224.09s -> 9228.58s]  Is he gonna go up? Did I put this down? Should I put this down? I'm gonna put
[9228.58s -> 9235.11s]  it down. Should I bring it with me? I'm gonna bring it with me. Might need
[9235.11s -> 9237.83s]  it. I'm gonna make him jump up there. I'm
[9238.23s -> 9258.87s]  gonna bring it with me. How was that four stars and the other
[9258.87s -> 9261.91s]  one was three? The other one was harder than that and it was like two.
[9261.91s -> 9279.99s]  I got the reset dress. I want it. You can
[9279.99s -> 9291.06s]  equip the outfit in the course world. Is that it for the dog?
[9291.06s -> 9301.24s]  I got the dog's shirt. Need some more coins to get some jobs over here.
[9301.24s -> 9305.08s]  Let me get through these. Tunnel to the dark side of the
[9305.08s -> 9307.56s]  moon. I think I tunnel all the way to
[9307.56s -> 9309.56s]  the other side of the moon because everything is upside down there. It's
[9309.56s -> 9312.55s]  pretty neat but kind of disorienting.
[9312.55s -> 9314.95s]  If you want to slide down a slope you gotta hit
[9314.95s -> 9321.98s]  up. I really didn't think that I was gonna
[9321.98s -> 9326.60s]  have this much fun in the random build the castle single player
[9326.60s -> 9348.38s]  but I kind of am. Wait. On you? Yes. Can I bounce you up the wall?
[9348.38s -> 9360.97s]  Oh my god. I didn't mean to do that. I turned the wrong way.
[9360.97s -> 9377.48s]  Okay, I'm gonna bounce him up the wall. Just getting him.
[9377.48s -> 9390.68s]  Oh. Well now that makes more sense. Upside down.
[9390.68s -> 9398.42s]  No, wait. Check the other thing. That's a death, isn't it?
[9398.42s -> 9412.52s]  Uh. At least I know I don't have to do that.
[9412.52s -> 9431.77s]  Just go in, grab, turn, run, jump. Nice. All right. Is there a point to
[9431.77s -> 9436.81s]  that? Anything over here? I don't think there's anything over
[9436.81s -> 9450.06s]  there. Slide? You can't slide as uh Cake Mario.
[9450.06s -> 9454.89s]  At least not upside down. Oh shit. I thought I was gonna go through.
[9457.30s -> 9477.51s]  Oh boy. Watch out. I can't get up there. I can get up there now, right? Yeah.
[9477.51s -> 9496.82s]  Just flip the switch upside down. I mean you
[9496.82s -> 9518.18s]  could do that. Maybe. German nuke the chat.
[9518.18s -> 9533.83s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[9533.83s -> 9542.81s]  All right. That was as if like a toddler was like walking towards
[9542.81s -> 9548.25s]  the stove. And like reaching up to the stove.
[9548.25s -> 9563.91s]  All right. Be careful, careful, careful. I can't kill the uh spike
[9563.91s -> 9573.24s]  head. I feel like if I jump too hard, high, it's gonna kill me off screen.
[9573.24s -> 9579.62s]  Is that gonna happen? No, but I can die. I can fall off here though, right?
[9579.62s -> 9582.90s]  Will that happen if I fall off here? I think so.
[9582.90s -> 9589.69s]  Just careful. Oh my god, that's gonna happen if I do that.
[9589.69s -> 9597.48s]  Can I get in this door? I just pressed down.
[9597.48s -> 9609.03s]  Don't go that far. I can get it twice, can I?
[9609.03s -> 9621.56s]  No, I can't. No, that's not gonna happen.
[9621.56s -> 9631.86s]  Super Mario, Super Mario, Super Mario. We've got a game of the year contender
[9631.86s -> 9635.29s]  here. I just pressed a button on my like OBS.
[9635.29s -> 9646.26s]  Am I still streaming? I think, yeah, I am. I like pressed my key. I like
[9646.26s -> 9648.74s]  mashed like a couple buttons on the keyboard.
[9648.74s -> 9652.58s]  Stop streaming is highlighted though. So I'm kind of,
[9652.58s -> 9665.72s]  I'm just gonna move my mouse to the other monitor. I said that's all these,
[9665.72s -> 9669.82s]  right? All the way up through 21. This one's
[9669.82s -> 9675.98s]  an easy one. I like easy ones. Am I gonna do a
[9675.98s -> 9681.06s]  Jerma Game Awards at the end of the year?
[9681.06s -> 9684.82s]  I'm probably not. I don't really do that anymore. Not since um
[9684.82s -> 9687.86s]  the YouTube days and even when I did it on YouTube.
[9687.86s -> 9692.74s]  It's kind of a joke anyways. I usually just tell you
[9692.74s -> 9710.97s]  I had to obey. I'm sorry. I was sinking, guys.
[9710.97s -> 9732.38s]  Gonna jump eventually. Oh, no. This is why I need Yoshi. Can I go
[9732.38s -> 9737.40s]  get him again? I want that coin. That motherfucker is
[9737.40s -> 9742.70s]  drowning down there. Come here, Yoshi. Where are you?
[9743.72s -> 9774.89s]  Yoshi. Come on. Hurry up. That's my opinion on Anthony Banthly for 2020.
[9774.89s -> 9779.00s]  We don't talk politics on this stream.
[9780.70s -> 9785.98s]  That candidate sucks. I just killed the thing that I wanted to come all the
[9785.98s -> 9794.54s]  way back into Respawn. I don't even care. Just go in there.
[9794.54s -> 9819.80s]  Oh yeah, I forgot. If you have a shell, you swim better. There he is.
[9819.88s -> 9825.35s]  Oh, I can't. I can't lift that bump. Should I do it again?
[9825.35s -> 9830.06s]  Should I? Should I do it again? Wait, things are doing?
[9830.06s -> 9855.82s]  I'm not a monster. I thought there was something up there. Where was the 30?
[9855.82s -> 9859.26s]  Some people said there's a 40 hour single player campaign. I don't think
[9859.26s -> 9862.14s]  that you were correct. I think you may have been just a
[9862.14s -> 9874.95s]  slight bit incorrect. Above the clouds, beyond the vines.
[9874.95s -> 9889.78s]  Vines growing all over it. Be my guest.
[9889.78s -> 9892.66s]  40 hour campaign. The game's been up for like 18 hours. Yeah, how would you even
[9892.66s -> 9902.50s]  know that? Unless like the press told you that.
[9902.50s -> 9908.34s]  Wait, I gotta go from keychain Mario to like grown-up Mario. There we go.
[9908.34s -> 9934.12s]  Which side? 40 hours of journalist difficulty?
[9935.62s -> 9947.50s]  Yeah? What were you gonna say? Tell me again?
[9947.50s -> 9953.24s]  What was it? Of journalist difficulty is what you said?
[9957.69s -> 9986.33s]  I almost just did it. I don't know why I just freaked out there. It was just half.
[9986.33s -> 9999.42s]  I love that like, it's kind of like the way.
[10000.38s -> 10005.50s]  What is it? What am I doing? What the fuck happened?
[10005.50s -> 10008.22s]  Can they go sideways? That's what it is. I didn't think they could go
[10008.22s -> 10010.78s]  sideways. They've evolved. They never used to be able to do
[10010.78s -> 10028.09s]  this shit. No! It's all right, let me get that.
[10029.61s -> 10035.93s]  Luigi, you would have died to that too. That would laugh my ass off
[10035.93s -> 10040.01s]  if there was like a problem with the game or something. It was a bug.
[10040.01s -> 10044.65s]  And Luigi got fucking smoked in the first 10 seconds.
[10052.12s -> 10067.99s]  Luigi's gotta call somebody else. Wario gets on the phone.
[10068.07s -> 10090.02s]  This game is a bullshit. This goddamn candy controller, I swear to God.
[10090.02s -> 10094.41s]  I could probably eat one of the switch controls and be fine. I really think
[10094.41s -> 10097.53s]  that. I could eat it and it would just,
[10097.53s -> 10109.85s]  it would come out be fine. Where am I? Good cloud.
[10109.85s -> 10129.51s]  This is gonna be risky. Risky play! What? Why did he
[10129.51s -> 10142.49s]  magnetize the other direction? I think I'm safe.
[10142.49s -> 10152.57s]  You're never safe though. Hold on. What is that? I don't, can you skip like the whole level?
[10152.57s -> 10172.95s]  Did I just put that out of reach? What the hell is the point of this?
[10172.95s -> 10197.27s]  It's the dev exit. Listen, I, the, I've got, I,
[10197.27s -> 10202.07s]  Mario, in all the Mario games, if you go over the flag, it just
[10202.07s -> 10207.82s]  stops you and you're at the top of the flag. Not in this one.
[10207.82s -> 10218.07s]  What do you mean not true? That's true. If you go over the flag
[10218.07s -> 10222.07s]  in the original Mario game, you, no that's right, that happens like the
[10222.07s -> 10236.76s]  first two or three of them that do that. That happens. What do I think about
[10236.76s -> 10241.82s]  chocolate pudding? It has bones in it. Chocolate pudding is fine, but chocolate
[10241.82s -> 10246.36s]  pudding is not jello. I mean, it could be. It could be chocolate
[10246.36s -> 10251.91s]  jello. Chocolate pudding is not jelly. I'm done.
[10251.91s -> 10255.11s]  No. Why did you do this to me? I'm not, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm
[10255.11s -> 10268.76s]  playing Mario. Goomba clubhouse. This sounds fun.
[10268.76s -> 10271.40s]  I love goombas. I love them so much that I made them a clubhouse. Aren't
[10271.40s -> 10275.08s]  they so cute when they scoot through those clear pipes?
[10275.08s -> 10279.72s]  Someone please go hang out with them and stomp on their heads.
[10279.72s -> 10301.83s]  I'll pay you. Wait, I think I have to have the rocket boost.
[10301.83s -> 10329.37s]  Yep, hold on. Three rocket boosts. Holy shit, I didn't die.
[10329.37s -> 10350.31s]  The audio is desynced. I thought it was going to crash.
[10350.31s -> 10359.08s]  You can't crash in the tube? Okay, what the fuck am I doing? It's
[10359.08s -> 10368.46s]  desynced. So listen, um, let me, I can do a test here.
[10368.46s -> 10370.78s]  Ready?
[10376.31s -> 10391.54s]  Are we synced? The audio is ahead. The game audio. Or me. Hold on.
[10391.54s -> 10398.09s]  So wait, hold on. You like, you know, me by 60 milliseconds?
[10398.09s -> 10402.87s]  So I'm a little late. So like, okay, let me see if it happens. Tell me if it
[10402.87s -> 10411.88s]  happens when I do this. Ready? Clear it, clear it, clear it.
[10412.04s -> 10416.46s]  Ready. One, two, three.
[10425.91s -> 10435.37s]  Game audio is ahead. Hold on. All right, ready. Clear it, clear the
[10435.37s -> 10439.14s]  clear.
[10451.74s -> 10479.46s]  Good. All right, here we go. I need all these keys. Oh, that's how
[10479.46s -> 10510.07s]  get this 10. all right so where do we go now? I'm thinking like a dank right here. if I just fell
[10510.07s -> 10535.56s]  down the hardest thing to die in, it might be time to throw myself. so we're in the middle. no stop!
[10536.44s -> 10544.18s]  coins on this side, coins above, coins down, coins back up.
[10544.18s -> 10555.66s]  oh, let's go all the way around. that's all right, this is the exit. all right, go this way.
[10558.14s -> 10569.51s]  I can't, like, go, I can't, you can't tele-frag them. I need one more key over there. what?
[10574.82s -> 10576.42s]  all right, let's, I'm, it's fine, I got it.
[10578.42s -> 10592.46s]  unless, wait, no, no, no, no, no, it's over here. there's probably not, there's no screen,
[10592.46s -> 10618.73s]  right? it's just this. I didn't get it. so bald. I can't, what's my voice doing?
[10624.30s -> 10636.04s]  main hall three. is there a fourth floor to the castle? I don't remember. oh man, oh fuck, oh
[10636.04s -> 10644.15s]  shit. oh man, this is bad. we've got a problem. I shouldn't say this out loud, so here. oh,
[10644.15s -> 10649.27s]  red toad got kidnapped while we were taking an unauthorized break. please bring red toad back
[10649.27s -> 10657.32s]  before the chief notices. we're all busted. no, it's not worth screaming. it's only, it's been
[10657.32s -> 10663.80s]  three hours. if I screamed, I was going to, I, I, my voice would be gone in, like, the next 45
[10663.80s -> 10684.41s]  minutes. reach the goal with one toad. fine, I'll do it myself. wee. why did I just get the,
[10684.41s -> 10699.11s]  this is low gravity. oh, this is the best song, I think, in the last 10 years or so.
[10699.11s -> 10719.82s]  you know. we're dead. he weighed me down. toad, you weighed me down. that's what happened.
[10722.30s -> 10735.56s]  hey, there's like that advanced technique where you can do that. you're kidding me. why were
[10735.56s -> 10750.47s]  you just standing still? don't, how did I not, I almost died in the same spot.
[10753.16s -> 10788.97s]  is it yellow fish? that's a 30 over there. can you jump? jump. oh, oh my god, what's
[10788.97s -> 10811.24s]  happening? oh my god, I, I, that hurt my body. I fell off that cliff. peek, today's peek the
[10811.24s -> 10814.68s]  mic day apparently. yeah, apparently. I'm not going to peek the mic again, it's not going
[10814.68s -> 10840.22s]  to happen. I have to get toad. if I accidentally press the ground pound again,
[10845.30s -> 10851.58s]  there was a time when you had to press down and like right or left trigger at the same time.
[10852.78s -> 10884.14s]  not just down. no, no, don't start over.
[10887.02s -> 10898.04s]  I wanted to get out of the pause menu. accidental button press god. it's all right.
[10899.08s -> 10926.10s]  that's not worth it. it's 10. who cares. it's not worth it. it's not worth it. I'm freaking
[10926.10s -> 10943.66s]  out again. jump up the, oh, toad, come here. oh, it's got my sights on me. toad, get back
[10943.66s -> 10963.61s]  over. I'm not trying to peek the mic. this is a bunch of free one-ups.
[11022.30s -> 11029.02s]  almost enough, right? red toad is back.
[11032.39s -> 11045.58s]  I think one-ups I would have if I didn't do the ground pound. bark, bark. let's go talk to
[11045.58s -> 11057.00s]  red toad and see if red toad has anything for us to do. something cool. red toad,
[11058.90s -> 11062.34s]  thank you so much for saving me. that was legitimately terrifying, but they just let me
[11062.34s -> 11068.04s]  go out of the blue. not that I'm complaining. maybe I was taken by mistake. why can I just
[11068.04s -> 11089.14s]  jump off the edge? sleeping on the job. there you are. hey, kid, want to help me out with a
[11089.14s -> 11096.25s]  job? you help me out, I'll erase the blocks on top of the pipe over there. molten rain.
[11096.25s -> 11102.07s]  your target this time is seven lava bubbles. once that, you don't know how to take out
[11102.07s -> 11108.17s]  lava bubbles. you want to pack your lunch too? don't worry so much, amigo. you'll figure it
[11108.17s -> 11124.76s]  out. defeat seven bubbles. I'll try. mario's like 40. mario's way older than 40.
[11139.16s -> 11181.70s]  oh. 58. get them all. for the true ending. never mind. who cares? give me one.
[11181.70s -> 11242.23s]  all right. take them down. this is the guy that beat dark souls. yeah, this is the guy that beat
[11242.23s -> 11263.94s]  the last boss in securo. the true last boss. stop. settle down. did he just, like, die?
[11264.74s -> 11275.11s]  he just used his whole head to do that. is he all right? anymore? he's got more.
[11280.60s -> 11287.50s]  erase the blocks gumming up the path over there. spiny busters. kill 15 spines.
[11288.22s -> 11292.34s]  use whatever tools you have at your disposal. adios. I'm counting on you.
[11304.47s -> 11343.50s]  so how do you give her to be, uh, spines? I get it. okay, I got them, but it doesn't work.
[11343.50s -> 11368.09s]  come on. I can get it. ready? oh, no, no. I got it. I'm fine. touch it? I clearly touched
[11368.09s -> 11385.35s]  that. that was pretty clear. get rid of the path here. sweet. nice work, kid. out. off those
[11385.35s -> 11390.55s]  blocks now. all right, uh, you lousy bunch of blocks. this is going to hurt me a lot more
[11390.55s -> 11424.31s]  than it hurt you. adios. that's it. there's 10 coins. I make 10 coins in my sleep. you help
[11424.31s -> 11428.23s]  me out. I'll give you some fancy clothes. I got $1,229. I make that in my sleep.
[11428.95s -> 11437.85s]  a single pom-pom. this time your target is a single pom-pom. they probably know
[11437.85s -> 11444.20s]  you're coming, so expect a trap. adios. and I get a t-shirt. defeat one pom-pom.
[11448.60s -> 11455.00s]  everyone's streaming Mario Maker 2 today? well, it is brand new. brand new game on
[11455.00s -> 11490.98s]  a beloved franchise. reach the goal to defeating all the pom-poms. let me hit you! oh!
[11491.38s -> 11524.62s]  oh, that's the one. you gotta let her do it. what the? one more time. thanks for the key.
[11536.95s -> 11545.43s]  you moving too much? I gotta move enough. so what's the, uh, what I get for, uh,
[11546.15s -> 11558.01s]  clothing? I love it. it's like a cookie monster shirt. can I put these on? or is
[11558.01s -> 11564.28s]  that my me? I think that's my me. what does this put? okay, hold on. where does this go?
[11564.28s -> 11588.79s]  new area. why did you do that? hello. have time for a job? there's something good in you for you.
[11592.23s -> 11597.75s]  house of blocks. we're in the market for a new house, and we need someone to inspect this place
[11597.75s -> 11602.65s]  we found. hit the blocks and climb to the top to check it out. you can also tilt
[11602.65s -> 11605.05s]  and mid or ground pound. hello. I hate doing that.
[11617.46s -> 11627.46s]  so the goal is that it's the climbers. I like the background. start building?
[11628.18s -> 11648.23s]  yeah, so I'm getting too caught up in the cartoon characters. how that works?
[11674.71s -> 11678.87s]  all the way back down. really? oh, please. was this super easy, boy?
[11692.36s -> 11714.39s]  good music. I'll take the music track. okay, get out of the way. I almost did it again.
[11733.18s -> 11745.88s]  can't. get me up there. no! there's a coin! I can get by. I'll just go back.
[11760.98s -> 11774.14s]  whatever. I got plenty of money. it was ten. it wasn't that big of a deal.
[11776.26s -> 11785.08s]  I'm gonna go build the rest of the hall. thank you. all right, I'm gonna make something good.
[11785.72s -> 11798.41s]  buildy buildy, roo roo, miracle roo. oh, cool. I put a special block somewhere.
[11799.78s -> 11806.78s]  well, you just told me where it was. stop being mad. mad? what do you mean mad?
[11807.34s -> 11824.89s]  all right, we got... no, I need to go talk to the chief. we need to start instruction. anyway,
[11824.89s -> 11828.97s]  main hall, third floor is complete. the castle is bursting at the seams with elegance. it's
[11828.97s -> 11839.59s]  looking... it's like looking into a mirror. we have new building options now. west hall cannon.
[11841.19s -> 11867.14s]  that sounds fun. and I can afford the west hall top. 582. west hall doors. do it. I am gonna
[11867.14s -> 11879.82s]  go hit that block though. so what's in the special blocks? why would I ask... chat that question
[11879.82s -> 11883.18s]  when in the time that there's like a five second... three to five second delay, I would have
[11883.18s -> 11901.93s]  already hit it in none. what's wrong with you? I want to punch toad in the mouth so fucking bad.
[11901.93s -> 11911.74s]  why? what's... why would you say something like that? yellow toad's been sleeping.
[11913.58s -> 11921.16s]  paw wake up call. reach the goal after defeating all nine spinies. hit some paw blocks.
[11921.16s -> 11935.11s]  you might be able to wake up this nameless toad. so we're gonna defeat all the spinies. punch him
[11935.11s -> 11958.89s]  in the mouth. where's the other one? just... just... it's done, right? that's it. nine out of
[11958.89s -> 11987.32s]  nine. get out. that was quick. that was cool. 40%. 41... 42%. something like that.
[11987.96s -> 12002.15s]  I had to go through all that to wake him up. why wouldn't I just kick him? I mean like gently.
[12002.87s -> 12019.27s]  or just scream. does it lean down and just be like... hey! hey! wake up! yawn. that was a
[12019.27s -> 12023.67s]  quality nap. couldn't get my hands on the stone that the chief wanted so I took a nap instead.
[12023.67s -> 12028.65s]  would you go and bring me back some stone? let's see. yeah I think this would do.
[12029.29s -> 12050.57s]  it's gonna be easy. reach the goal while holding a stone. bring me a stone. reach
[12050.57s -> 12064.94s]  the goal while holding a stone. where's the stone? one of these? can I break one of these off?
[12070.39s -> 12073.59s]  you didn't mention what stone. you just said a stone.
[12074.95s -> 12082.57s]  can I actually play as Luigi? I don't want to call him though.
[12083.37s -> 12101.13s]  I don't want to talk to him. somebody else call him. that very clearly was eaten and
[12101.13s -> 12142.50s]  puked up. where's the stone? how am I supposed to get up there? I mean that's how I'm gonna do it.
[12143.30s -> 12257.50s]  where's the stone? I didn't even see a stone to pick up. oh! kill them! eight seconds! you can't
[12257.50s -> 12286.25s]  throw... it's too heavy. I tried to throw it up like three times. the thing is really heavy.
[12286.25s -> 12316.20s]  twitch acting! get out of here! this is bullshit! this is bullshit! oh my god! I get called one more
[12316.20s -> 12333.14s]  time by Luigi. I'm gonna fucking be mad. gimme this motherfucker! get over here! kill all of
[12333.14s -> 12339.30s]  them! kill them all! literally kill them all! I don't want to see any of their faces ever
[12339.30s -> 12348.10s]  again. that's what's making this so stupid is just dodging the fucking six bones that are on
[12348.10s -> 12357.10s]  the screen at the same time. get out of here! all right now I can play the game. they're gonna
[12357.10s -> 12367.46s]  come back aren't they? I'm so like tilted right now. I guess someone called me an actor
[12368.02s -> 12401.46s]  because I couldn't throw a brick on top of the stove or whatever the dumb thing is. oh yeah?
[12402.58s -> 12440.10s]  yeah? is that what it is guys? come on man! go! I gotta get three! oh do I need more?
[12449.61s -> 12504.89s]  I need more than one! I'm gonna lose time again. actor! thank you for the applause! that was a pretty
[12504.89s -> 12534.65s]  good acting job. that was a one star quest. oh go get more stones this time. make sure you eat
[12534.65s -> 12561.90s]  it through the wall. I'm gonna do this one first try here. this doesn't require me to eat
[12561.90s -> 12626.10s]  it through the wall with Yoshi. I'm gonna get this. wall jump off this?
[12626.58s -> 12669.37s]  oh my god it's already fucking time to go to bed. oh shit hold on.
[12677.88s -> 12707.91s]  dive kick. I want those. whatever I don't have time for this. I thought that was gonna kill me
[12707.91s -> 12714.78s]  for a second. where's the uh bomb? there's gonna be a bomb here. oh no what can I kick?
[12714.86s -> 12725.94s]  what did I just do? what did I just do? what did I just do? okay hold on. I want that.
[12728.82s -> 12734.87s]  I want that shit. I don't think I can get it. the bomb bomb thing was gone.
[12739.96s -> 12746.34s]  I thought another uh bomb build thing was gonna fall. such emotional range.
[12746.90s -> 12785.53s]  good acting. all right one more. and the stones. I hate the stone ones.
[12786.73s -> 12808.79s]  the worst addition to the game so far. let me go. let me actually go up.
[12809.75s -> 12820.47s]  oh you got you got a combination of a stone level and a water level.
[12821.27s -> 12825.03s]  I may as well just punch the toe in the face like that guy wanted to like an hour ago.
[12825.67s -> 12842.04s]  no don't let it fall.
[12888.14s -> 12890.62s]  the active thing is making me laugh like over and over again.
[12890.62s -> 12898.65s]  I need the water to come down.
[12915.34s -> 12936.47s]  no up. thank you. only five? I'm so tilted about the actor joke.
[12937.67s -> 12941.03s]  no I'm not tilted about the actor joke. I'm tilted about the stone.
[12943.70s -> 12946.82s]  I couldn't do the stone and because I couldn't do the stone level
[12947.70s -> 12951.78s]  the fact that somebody said that I was pretending to not know how to do the stone level
[12951.78s -> 12960.54s]  because I didn't know how to do that. it was infuriating me because I actually didn't know.
[12961.34s -> 12986.90s]  calm down and have some jello. all right I got I can I can do it with the build.
[12987.46s -> 13009.99s]  this new area looks pretty good. that was close. oh that car almost hit me.
[13010.63s -> 13018.38s]  I flinched and moved. I felt that one coming in here. okay I need a thousand.
[13018.38s -> 13025.43s]  so that is that all the jobs that um stone toad wanted me to do?
[13026.31s -> 13035.70s]  so let's get some more money. is it gonna take forever? I'm already 52% of the way there.
[13037.53s -> 13042.84s]  it's only three and a half hours guys. what are we talking about? booze towering house of terror.
[13047.67s -> 13054.87s]  am I gonna play animal crossing when it comes out? maybe. that depends on if anybody wants to see it.
[13057.08s -> 13071.74s]  it's worth the shot. I felt the world start moving to the right so I figured maybe
[13071.74s -> 13101.29s]  this is a possibility. jeez. come on. come over. careful. careful. scooby doo house.
[13105.64s -> 13120.54s]  um sure. gonna go all the way to here. this is making my blood moldy.
[13122.94s -> 13134.26s]  blood mold. and why do you have blood sitting out? that's I think a better question. those ones
[13134.26s -> 13142.97s]  are faster. oh man. oh man. what do I do about this? I think I have to go over like this.
[13144.01s -> 13191.42s]  oh man. oh why did I turn? oh my god. I want a mushroom. I don't feel safe right now.
[13191.42s -> 13219.22s]  I need a mushroom. once the blood gets out it starts to sour. I don't. I don't. oh yeah right.
[13219.22s -> 13224.92s]  talking about like the blood that you were eating or something right? big showdown on
[13224.92s -> 13232.39s]  little star. has toad given me any four star levels? it is one. it's already done though.
[13234.49s -> 13240.89s]  yeah that's what I already did. big showdown on little star. if anyone receives this transmission
[13240.89s -> 13246.01s]  please help. bowser jr has invaded this small planet and we require assistance. the gravity is
[13246.01s -> 13251.61s]  odd here but you can still hold b while bouncing off of enemies to do a super jump. stomp bowser
[13251.61s -> 13288.04s]  into submission. oh cute song. it told me if I held b it would jump off of this and you told
[13288.04s -> 13315.27s]  me if I held b. I'm holding b right now. I'm holding b at the moment. right now. it's not
[13315.27s -> 13325.94s]  that bad. not as bad as I originally thought it was gonna be. here's the moon. can do anything?
[13325.94s -> 13342.58s]  the moon attacks you too? he has a smiling face. the sun is angry. moon shouldn't be like
[13342.58s -> 13364.12s]  this. worth a shot to see if anything in here. you guys weren't kidding when you said it gets
[13364.12s -> 13382.50s]  you lives. try to avoid it the whole time. okay. is that bowser jr? this is like infant bowser.
[13383.14s -> 13411.85s]  thanks for the key. love thud. see I want to play more levels like this. the fun cute ones.
[13426.23s -> 13433.32s]  boring boomer levels. well you gotta do them. you gotta make the money.
[13434.04s -> 13445.78s]  uh what do we need? a thousand? what about the little block down there? no I need money.
[13446.58s -> 13452.02s]  I'll go do the block stuff when I get enough money to build again. red yoshi's cheap cheap
[13452.02s -> 13464.65s]  cleanup. reach the goal after defeating at least 25 cheap cheeps. he's only in it for
[13464.65s -> 13485.42s]  the money. yes in mario maker 2. am I gonna do any created levels tonight? um yeah we'll
[13485.42s -> 13492.57s]  probably see. I'm assuming I'll get this single player stuff done in um probably in the next
[13493.77s -> 13511.88s]  couple hours. we'll see. we'll see how it goes. am I gonna hurt him? I missed a couple.
[13525.06s -> 13542.86s]  free. shit. shit. shit. oh no. oh that's fine. wait it's not fine. can I do it again?
[13542.86s -> 13583.96s]  I don't need yoshi anymore right? all right let's go. but yeah after the end of this
[13584.60s -> 13589.74s]  this will probably take us to the six to seven hour mark. I feel like I would just do mario
[13589.74s -> 13594.55s]  maker 2 again. I'll just do uh created levels because I feel like I don't know part of me says
[13594.55s -> 13599.43s]  that the multiplayer there's probably some cool stuff but it hasn't even been a day. I think
[13599.43s -> 13602.71s]  I'd want to give at least a few days or something for people to make cool levels.
[13603.43s -> 13615.54s]  all right this one's two star. hit the on off switch to get the pink coins.
[13616.84s -> 13624.22s]  there's been some neat stuff already. yeah we'll see how this is. I'm having a great time here.
[13625.43s -> 13632.07s]  this is just what I'm looking for right now. do a germa level thing. that's another thing too.
[13632.07s -> 13635.35s]  I mean if people wanted to make stuff I will. I'm definitely gonna play this again.
[13635.35s -> 13640.47s]  that's certain. so maybe people want to make some stuff they fairly felt like it.
[13642.39s -> 13651.35s]  all right so hold on. I'm gonna do this like puzzle. all right so there's that.
[13652.07s -> 13685.70s]  there's that one. and okay we could do this. two. oops. I gotta get that.
[13686.50s -> 13701.48s]  there's one. there's two. there's three. switch it off first.
[13702.36s -> 13723.22s]  it's a daisy. oops. just keep it on. what are you doing? now turn it off after it bounces.
[13724.26s -> 13732.07s]  I want to give you my pokemon cards. you keep your keep your pokemon cards.
[13732.87s -> 13746.52s]  this is gonna be worth like thousands of dollars one day. oh shit. okay hold on. I gotta time this.
[13747.80s -> 13756.04s]  no no no no. keep I'm gonna keep it locked in on the other one. and then now we do it.
[13757.40s -> 13777.37s]  not now. no. so I can get it. nice. should I break them all? or at least these ones?
[13778.57s -> 13780.89s]  there might be some treasure in here or something. it's possible.
[13781.85s -> 13798.98s]  all the ones I have to step on. like that. if it ain't broke don't fix it. I thought there
[13798.98s -> 13815.02s]  might be a coin thing in there. secret block. right. that's what I'm saying. if it ain't fixed
[13815.02s -> 13830.06s]  don't break it. blink blank blunk. I made a house for ant troopers out of blinking blocks.
[13830.06s -> 13834.14s]  can someone check to make sure the path is clear? I will do it. and then after this I
[13834.14s -> 13841.24s]  have enough money to do the other wing. I need 1100. and then we'll go back down to the block
[13841.24s -> 13867.77s]  guy and see what he wants to do. bye. that was instant. I'm gonna fall over here so I can just
[13867.77s -> 13884.86s]  kill him. like that. yeah these look. yeah the ants look super weird. they really do.
[13886.30s -> 13906.02s]  I gotta get as many coins as I can possibly grab with two hands. can I say ants again? ants.
[13906.02s -> 13909.38s]  why?
[13917.98s -> 13930.52s]  thought that was the end. two three.
[13941.24s -> 13968.50s]  you fucking idiot. oh my god. I tried to do it so fast. it's all right. I'm right here. two three.
[13968.50s -> 13977.93s]  what the fuck just happened to be. no.
[13981.69s -> 14030.60s]  okay I'm fine. that's 50. slow down. I'm just gonna fall. all right I'm good. just jump on them.
[14032.04s -> 14048.63s]  unnecessary. unnecessary. in between. I love in between all this.
[14049.43s -> 14062.68s]  somebody just writes. why this like. I don't even understand. all right.
[14063.48s -> 14074.92s]  uh west hall roof. might as well just finish the west hall. now I'm gonna go down to the block guy.
[14075.72s -> 14084.73s]  construction has started on the west hall roof. we got the construction cover. just get out of
[14084.73s -> 14090.86s]  here. seven new jobs. but I want to go over here because now doing these jobs will complete
[14090.86s -> 14109.08s]  the building. right? okay darkness ahead. darkness below. could you take a look at
[14109.08s -> 14115.34s]  the basement and tell us how spacious it is? maybe a dark level. do I have any thoughts
[14115.34s -> 14127.80s]  on gaming? no. not really. it's pretty fun. this one's gonna be hell. I remember
[14127.80s -> 14131.96s]  doing this one in donkey kong country and it made me break a like a nintendo 64 controller.
[14132.84s -> 14165.40s]  oh no. whatever it was. super nintendo. scary. actually scary. there's a lot of coins though.
[14171.34s -> 14186.44s]  I can't wait for people to make horror games. they're going to. oh why did I wait that
[14186.44s -> 14192.92s]  extra second for. I waited a half second for no reason. I don't know why I did that.
[14193.96s -> 14237.10s]  it hurts. glare. ding dong. did I find a secret? get me out of that one. amazon package. yeah
[14237.50s -> 14242.33s]  that's true. all right. after this next one I'm going to take the first break in the night.
[14242.33s -> 14246.41s]  I'm going to grab something to drink. go to the bathroom and I might even eat
[14247.05s -> 14257.72s]  a piece of turkey as quickly as I can. where are you putting this one? I put a oh a hidden block.
[14258.60s -> 14272.60s]  red flower. red flower. interesting. you got any more? yep. one last job and we get an
[14272.60s -> 14279.66s]  outfit. finally found a place that we love but it's been infested by the whomps. could you
[14279.66s -> 14301.78s]  please survey the damage they've done? yeah. hi top. the whomp tower. can I stand on his head?
[14302.90s -> 14316.44s]  I can. sometimes I don't know. cranberry sauce is fruit jello. whatever your opinion is on that
[14317.48s -> 14342.94s]  I respect it and that's fine. that's it. I probably could have seen that one coming but
[14342.94s -> 14374.36s]  I didn't. he's getting impatient. this is where it starts to derail if he does anything
[14374.36s -> 14439.45s]  else stupid. calm down. Jesus. oh oh same audio clip. oh oh oh oh for real. I have to get that.
[14439.45s -> 14460.44s]  I just had to trigger it so much earlier. I just got that was hit. oh dude hitbox point.
[14461.00s -> 14502.41s]  hitbox. oh I missed a secret. I don't care. the stream title is actually better than others.
[14502.81s -> 14509.42s]  oh it's yeah it's just you should have seen it before. I went through two or three iterations.
[14509.42s -> 14514.58s]  I love this shirt. what was it before I turned the stream on? it was it to me and then space
[14514.58s -> 14520.26s]  in brackets. hey greg smith. I just want to let you know if you're watching if you come across
[14520.26s -> 14524.66s]  this you have a package that I have for you. just come in and confirm that it's your package.
[14524.66s -> 14537.78s]  end bracket. it was something like that. it was like a whole three sentences. all right well

[14581.61s -> 14586.41s]  build yet still the atmosphere lacks. if you'll do me a favor I'll cover the ground with
[14586.41s -> 14599.43s]  flowers so sweet. cheap cheap maze. this one's pretty hard. this is sound frog. it's super
[14599.43s -> 14615.45s]  frog. no I hope it has candy. take the break? I forgot. sorry it's underwater. delete. I'm just
[14615.45s -> 14625.10s]  gonna close my eyes. I'm closing my eyes right now. I don't who cares to go. how am I doing?
[14625.10s -> 14639.91s]  have I hit anything yet? I think I'm in a wall I think. I'm definitely like trapped in a wall.
[14640.63s -> 14650.97s]  should I open my eyes? I'm gonna open them. okay well I'm just like floating here. that's
[14651.05s -> 14674.76s]  cool. was I just floating the whole time? turn it into the orchestra one.
[14708.78s -> 14724.62s]  okay I'm fine. can I make it? is it enough? is that's enough? no it's not. is that space
[14724.70s -> 14764.15s]  there? fucking just don't do that. play. thought about it. I lost all the coins that I got though.

[14810.33s -> 14842.36s]  yeah I do. you know I don't. should I go over them? I guess. oh god.
[14847.05s -> 15056.22s]  I have to do the whole thing again. guys I don't have a switch anymore.
[15056.22s -> 15064.92s]  I just frisbeated out the window as hard as I could. oh the music box. never mind.
[15067.34s -> 15109.64s]  you guys are trapped here forever. oh come on. just whatever. oh what the hell.
[15118.78s -> 15123.66s]  oh my god. it's the floatiness of the water combined with the smallness of the character
[15123.66s -> 15127.34s]  combined with the music in the background combined with the darkness that is making
[15127.34s -> 15192.97s]  me have a problem. got them all didn't I? no I didn't. no I got it. okay. I'm good.
[15192.97s -> 15212.94s]  are you mad? are you mad at us? how could I be mad at you guys? for what? my thanks are yours.
[15212.94s -> 15236.97s]  the flowers bloom and down we get... ribbit. do the floss please. brightness. come on. two more,
[15236.97s -> 15250.81s]  right? yes there's more. that means they're gonna be harder. I'll move some mountains.
[15250.81s -> 15256.89s]  hold your breath. another underwater one. uh I'm determined to show my dearest my finest
[15256.89s -> 15260.25s]  qualities. I know she'd be impressed to see me swim across the river without once coming
[15260.25s -> 15270.68s]  up for air. reach the goal without getting out of the water. I'm not looking forward to this.
[15271.40s -> 15277.83s]  is this the way to kill mario?
[15285.21s -> 15292.20s]  please grab this. whatever it is. you missed. just...
[15293.88s -> 15299.30s]  I didn't get out. I'm still in. I was holding my head under the water.
[15306.62s -> 15315.40s]  get away from me. can I step on your head? yes I can. don't. fire under water? don't
[15315.40s -> 15342.66s]  really make much sense. I know but it is video game. I was looking over a chat.
[15343.62s -> 15346.58s]  someone told me to shut up so I just looked at it. I was like hey why'd that person say shut up?
[15348.10s -> 15372.46s]  why is everything 10 fps? shouldn't be. this one's a lot easier than the last one. I'm not
[15372.46s -> 15408.76s]  gonna choke. I'm good. I'm gonna choke. that took longer than winning going forward.
[15409.80s -> 15417.16s]  I thought it was gonna be a mushroom. I wasn't on top of his head? I wasn't on top of his
[15417.16s -> 15453.30s]  head. I was on his head. I don't understand that. I'm going fast. go up water. go up go up.
[15453.30s -> 15476.34s]  already got it. don't even need it. all right come on. do this underwater level while holding
[15476.34s -> 15490.62s]  your breath in real life. that's a pretty dumb idea. so I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna
[15490.62s -> 15517.10s]  decline that gamer funny challenge there. just shoot him. I'm still in.
[15517.98s -> 15548.10s]  oh oh oh I'm sorry about the mic being peaked. I really am. I'm not like this. this is the first
[15548.10s -> 15553.22s]  stream you've ever watched on my channel. I'm not like this. I don't like... did he just
[15553.22s -> 15571.90s]  get rid of the pole? how do I complete the level? I don't usually... no I don't usually
[15571.90s -> 15581.91s]  snore. you're right. this gg idiot. what is this? I can't even hear it anyways. never mind.
[15582.55s -> 15594.10s]  I think I might have the headphones plugged in. the mountains move. a groove so funky. here we go.
[15598.42s -> 15633.78s]  there they come. kind of ugly. got anything else? you got one more. it's gonna be a four star.
[15634.58s -> 15645.98s]  special close. it is a four star difficulty sea of sorrow. my dearest has dumped me and
[15645.98s -> 15656.06s]  so I float aimlessly adrift on a sea of sorrow wallow with me mario. that got sort of sad.
[15663.93s -> 15695.53s]  is this supposed to be him crying? get in the shoe. what? punch all of the ghosts in the face?
[15700.76s -> 15712.47s]  look at chap. he doesn't know and that's why I look over there.
[15713.43s -> 15755.38s]  let's continue. watch out. you're gonna crush the blocks, right? and then come down.
[15756.18s -> 15760.62s]  come down? do you come down?
[15763.42s -> 15765.90s]  guess you kind of do.
[15769.18s -> 15773.46s]  all the way? what's over here?
[15776.50s -> 15782.36s]  this is one of those freaky levels. yeah this is a freaky one.
[16145.77s -> 16165.80s]  what's the goal here? what's the end goal? well leave me be please. I can't believe he
[16165.80s -> 16170.28s]  just fucking sniped me. you gotta be kidding me. it's all right. this is it, right? okay.
[16171.08s -> 16191.03s]  that wasn't even really that bad but it kind of was. oh frog cap. what does this mold your
[16191.03s -> 16196.25s]  blood thing? I don't understand. don't mold your blood. mold mold. is this like a new
[16196.25s -> 16217.56s]  thing that I don't know what it is? yawn. okay seven jobs. how much is it to build?
[16218.60s -> 16232.34s]  okay keep up the good work. I'm gonna do main hall roof. I need 1500. I need money.
[16233.14s -> 16248.15s]  is there a uh there's no cost. I can't like change my costume right now.
[16249.43s -> 16256.26s]  all right we got three more and then we got a pretty hard one. so
[16256.26s -> 16261.72s]  deep in the windy valley. can you withstand the cold and make it to the bottom of the
[16261.72s -> 16273.54s]  valley? let's see. am I not gonna make any courses? not on stream. no. I am absolutely 100%
[16273.54s -> 16283.82s]  not capable of making a interesting level on this stream. no way. I'm gonna wait till the
[16283.82s -> 16304.22s]  wind blows this way. he doesn't believe in himself. I mean I just I just don't believe I
[16304.22s -> 16313.82s]  could make anything that was worth watching because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.
[16313.82s -> 16318.52s]  I didn't do the I didn't really make any the first one. I'd have to relearn all the tools
[16320.36s -> 16326.95s]  that would be like a six hour tutorial stream. I'd rather just make the cool shit that people have
[16327.83s -> 16335.30s]  and enjoy the awesome creativity that the community puts forth after I beat the single
[16335.30s -> 16353.56s]  player because this is fucking fun and I almost got really mad. there's the key.
[16354.60s -> 16369.37s]  played league of legends. now that's something I can guarantee I have never heard before on
[16369.37s -> 16386.87s]  this channel. that's a lot of coins. I'll take it. gonna play league. sorry. unfortunately.
[16388.39s -> 16400.73s]  not gonna be playing league of legends on this channel. he offered you to play league. I
[16400.73s -> 16404.57s]  doubled. I will double it if you don't. whatever he will offer you to play league,
[16404.57s -> 16412.01s]  I'll double it if you don't. can I just say no? why does that have to be money involved?
[16412.97s -> 16425.46s]  they're getting a little harder. seesaw's ancient seesaw fortress.

[17218.10s -> 17248.25s]  explosion. damage frame Susan. yes. easy easy easy easy. that wasn't easy. it was quickly.
[17249.05s -> 17269.30s]  it was quickly. haven't really played like 50 something levels. underground piranha creeper.
[17269.30s -> 17280.50s]  the underground menace. I'll pay you to take care of it. 40 equals 50. I have played 50
[17280.50s -> 17287.45s]  something level because I did 40 in a row here on this list and then I also did the dog.
[17287.45s -> 17296.81s]  I also did the eraser head man. I also did the yawning guy. it's like 55 or something.
[17297.37s -> 17298.41s]  you don't think I know what I'm doing?
[17301.74s -> 17324.84s]  oh shit. I gotta outrun the snake. I like these things. this is cool.
[17324.84s -> 17371.03s]  fire flower? give it here. shit. I swear to god. I swear to god. I just...
[17372.54s -> 17375.18s]  the stick against the wall thing is just... I'm not... I just...
[17375.18s -> 17385.83s]  I had it but then I did go on the other side. that's a big oof.
[17388.06s -> 17411.32s]  this is the ASMR level. I'm gonna get that 10 points. watch.
[17415.37s -> 17417.61s]  damage breaks. oh my god. don't do it again, Jeremy. please.
[17422.79s -> 17430.31s]  the button. the stupid little tiny fucking chocolate chip buttons. I pressed them all.
[17431.51s -> 17472.50s]  I got a niece, right? this niece is... is that... she's six. I really do believe
[17472.50s -> 17475.70s]  that she would have trouble holding this and pressing buttons because her hands are too big.
[17477.06s -> 17478.18s]  if this guy kills me, I quit.
[17480.18s -> 17525.56s]  I have to... liar. I will... hold on. I'm gonna quit. that doesn't mean I'm gonna...
[17525.56s -> 17536.04s]  I'm gonna watch luigi beat it for this. liar.
[17545.72s -> 17570.79s]  all right. I quit. cigarettes. I'm not gonna smoke them anymore.
[17573.06s -> 17583.74s]  that's... that's what I meant. today's the day. save me, snake walk. sure.
[17584.38s -> 17591.34s]  need to find novel ways to use the snake block. this is gonna be fun.
[17598.26s -> 17609.75s]  do you actually smoke? no. like, you just... no. no. because, you know, obviously no. I don't.
[17609.75s -> 17617.91s]  I do not. you know, if it were me playing the game right now,
[17618.87s -> 17627.22s]  I would have jumped and freaked out like five times. sometimes. you just have a confidence
[17627.22s -> 17638.87s]  boost here that you can do anything. for instance, I can do anything. I can do anything.
[17642.31s -> 17660.98s]  I don't even need to look. I wasn't aware you could get crushed on the top of the screen.
[17660.98s -> 17704.15s]  I didn't know the screen had a sky block. and why did it kill me? the screen goes up.
[17704.15s -> 17711.77s]  what? one of these mario video game historians tell me why that happened.
[17712.73s -> 17726.94s]  that's going too fast. gotta keep up. come on. I'm moving fast as the screen is going.
[17727.74s -> 17770.33s]  oh, shit. do more. 63%. almost do the other side. with a land of the dark level. pitch black
[17770.33s -> 17786.20s]  underground. this one's gonna be a blast. change the outfit. the outfit is only for my me,
[17786.20s -> 17804.28s]  isn't it? because I don't want to lose my weight. what? I? okay. I thought I could jump on it.
[17821.24s -> 17832.74s]  does it keep going? you just beat the light. you go forward. how do I not get any of this?
[17837.82s -> 17844.26s]  I don't know. well, was something else supposed to get? oh, my god.
[17879.22s -> 17919.08s]  thanks for the help, Luigi. do I run out of these or something? how do I delete them?
[17919.64s -> 17938.42s]  can I delete them? I hate this. I'm just gonna take it slow.
[17942.90s -> 17951.90s]  the p is just the light. it's no other purpose. what the fuck?
[17953.58s -> 17978.41s]  I just gotta let it go forward. I'm leaning back in my chair. that's bad. I gotta get up.
[17992.20s -> 18013.26s]  okay. follow the p and prepare for that shit. how do I get those?
[18014.22s -> 18022.31s]  I'm missing so many cool secrets. was it 50? is it 50? can you tell? is it 50?
[18023.75s -> 18040.06s]  30. can I stand on those? holy fuck. I was looking. you've gotta be fucking kidding me.
[18040.06s -> 18053.50s]  I thought I... I am so dumb. I was looking at chat. I thought it was gonna just take me
[18053.50s -> 18093.85s]  like the whole way around. can I get that 50? I can ride that POW. where's the rest of that?
[18093.85s -> 18118.26s]  I need the POW to be over here. I think I have to jump. holy shit. be careful. it's up.
[18119.46s -> 18129.93s]  okay. what did that do? anything for me? not really. what if I hit the POW? will that get
[18129.93s -> 18165.38s]  the coin? I made it. I didn't get the 30 coins, though. one more. it fell down. oh, shit.
[18166.26s -> 18182.01s]  bouncing through the clouds. reach the goal after grabbing at least 40 coins.
[18182.65s -> 18198.60s]  and there's a bunch of bullet bills. gotta get 40. there's no time.
[18200.04s -> 18217.11s]  with the quickness. with the swiftness there. maybe you guys said bullet hell.
[18217.11s -> 18242.47s]  and there it is. and there it is. and see what. I just gotta pay attention to where the
[18242.47s -> 18252.04s]  bullets are. and not that else. I have plenty of time. holy shit. I'm just gonna kill them.
[18252.76s -> 18281.10s]  now. that's it. with 65 seconds to spare. very cool. how long do switch controllers last?
[18284.46s -> 18290.22s]  outside the dock at full charge. more than like seven or eight hours? or is it less than that?
[18290.94s -> 18306.57s]  there's the top of the castle. it's done. now we gotta finish the right side.
[18308.89s -> 18314.89s]  avant-garde style of the interior parapets. it looks amazing. keep up the good work.
[18315.85s -> 18325.94s]  east hall. second floor. build it. congrats on the main hall. roof germa. thank you.
[18327.80s -> 18349.18s]  thanks. that means a lot. thank you. how many. all right. did I do all the jobs back here?
[18349.82s -> 18365.11s]  the first five. all right. the first five pages are completely done. all right. we got
[18365.11s -> 18372.41s]  bumper jump around. bumper jump around. I added some bumpers to my athletic course.
[18375.22s -> 18384.09s]  change outfit. I will. after this level, I'm gonna change my outfit. we'll see what it looks
[18384.09s -> 18403.14s]  like. all this shit saves, right? well, now I gotta use gamer skill or else I'm not gonna make it.
[18403.14s -> 18479.61s]  that's what I need. pick me up. pick me up. I avoided everything else. this time I actually
[18479.61s -> 18502.71s]  have the hat on. get all the coins. good job. don't blow it again.
[18503.35s -> 18536.04s]  what am I doing? hurry up and get it. such a stressful game. it just is. flag was right here.
[18537.24s -> 18552.41s]  this should be relaxing. you know, it's weird because it's 50% relaxing. 50% build the castle.
[18553.61s -> 18558.38s]  I just want to build it. I kind of don't care about anything else.
[18559.02s -> 18570.23s]  platforms really are stressful. change my mind. I don't think I have to change your mind.
[18570.23s -> 18575.30s]  I think I probably agree with you. we've got a couple of relaxing ones ahead of us though.
[18575.30s -> 18579.77s]  master the trees. we just have to climb some trees. reach the goal if you're doing a hand
[18579.77s -> 18586.01s]  stand on all the trees. this is a one star. what time is the movie night tomorrow? same time
[18586.01s -> 18593.22s]  as the regular spring. by the way, if you have not gotten a submission in and you want to,
[18594.28s -> 18599.24s]  make sure you get it in by tonight because if you get it in by tomorrow morning, afternoon,
[18599.24s -> 18608.34s]  pacific, it's gonna be hard to add you to the list. oh, I forgot to change the outfit. I'll do
[18608.34s -> 18616.79s]  it after this. never mind. I guess we'll do it now. and remember that this tomorrow is not a
[18616.79s -> 18623.10s]  contest. we're just picking some of the, I guess we're gonna, there's like a, essentially
[18623.10s -> 18651.02s]  a net to try to catch some of the higher quality submissions. ready to submit? there's
[18651.02s -> 18670.07s]  a google form. only submit one video. we can get the google form link if somebody has it.
[18670.07s -> 18679.59s]  and it has to include video footage from the green screen. you can't just, you can't just
[18679.59s -> 18685.19s]  submit. I'm not gonna say it because somebody will. so just make sure it's green screen.
[18686.15s -> 18699.26s]  okay, hold on. were you running through this?
[18702.54s -> 18710.17s]  what am i talking about? so six months ago or so, we did a green screen movie night where i
[18710.17s -> 18714.17s]  went in front of the green screen and recorded like six or seven hours with the stuff.
[18714.89s -> 18719.13s]  and then the community came together and made a bunch of random stuff that was the green screen
[18719.13s -> 18723.21s]  movie night. there were hundreds and hundreds of videos that we watched.
[18723.69s -> 18732.38s]  and people thought it was a lot of fun, so for the longest time, i wanted to do another one, which is
[18733.26s -> 18744.65s]  not as long as the first one. that's what tomorrow night is. that dive kick is freaking me out.
[18744.65s -> 18778.06s]  climb up. done. am i gonna get bounced around here until i die? oh my god. jeremy, turn up my
[18778.14s -> 18807.22s]  jeremy. turn up my mic. what's wrong with my mic? it looks fine over here. on my end, it looks like
[18807.22s -> 18812.58s]  everything's fine. i don't know. that's weird. maybe when i got really loud it just fucked up.
[18818.46s -> 18823.22s]  all right, outfit. yeah, no, no, no. outfit, outfit, outfit, outfit. it's hard to hear me.
[18823.86s -> 18830.39s]  i swear to god, there's some weird thing how this pulls in through obs and pushes out.
[18831.11s -> 18842.33s]  because over on my obs, it looks like i'm about to peek every single sentence i say. it's strange.
[18842.33s -> 18849.78s]  i'm at like just about like minus eight db, or minus like five, like into the red. so i don't
[18849.78s -> 18858.70s]  know. that's weird. i get that a lot though. it's definitely not just one person. so don't
[18858.70s -> 18865.43s]  ask me why it's like that. i'll dial myself up a little bit here. all right, so what do
[18865.43s -> 18871.58s]  i go to do this stuff? back to the title, notification settings, play guide, back to title.
[18871.58s -> 18896.65s]  like where would i do this? watch me lose all that progress. okay, play, right? course world.
[18897.45s -> 18908.73s]  my stream's always relatively quiet. i wonder why. there i am doing the charlie brown dance.
[18910.58s -> 18921.24s]  change outfit. i got some new hats. where are they? where are they? i got another one,
[18921.24s -> 18933.51s]  didn't i? oh, it's weirdly spaced. oh, i have an animated hoodie. is that for pre-ordering the
[18933.51s -> 18949.21s]  game or something? i like this one. and then what's the full suit? oh, it's the dress.
[18949.21s -> 18970.39s]  okay, i like the cookie monster though. there we go. hyped. that's how i'm always just so
[18970.39s -> 18980.98s]  hyped, right? that's usually what? change face? no. all right, i'm not ready for this yet.
[18980.98s -> 19004.30s]  i want to... i'm still building the house. upside down stretches. i think my life would be better
[19004.30s -> 19013.53s]  if i didn't watch germa. well, i... that's a... i mean, that's like a... that's a... that's a you
[19013.53s -> 19019.34s]  thing. i... i don't know how to tell you about... and i just jumped off the edge because
[19019.34s -> 19028.54s]  i'm just trying to... i'm reading. i'd probably get more shit done, to be honest.
[19030.66s -> 19037.59s]  don't go anywhere. don't go anywhere just yet. hold on a second here. what about those
[19037.59s -> 19041.80s]  funny tuber moments? what if you... what if you missed the... all right, i'm done. not with the
[19041.80s -> 19045.00s]  game, but just like with what i was just doing. no, i'm not. i'm gonna keep going. what about those
[19045.00s -> 19055.67s]  funny tuber moments? but you might miss those if you didn't hang out. why hasn't luigi decided
[19055.67s -> 19086.97s]  to help me in a long time? he blocked him. no, he blocked me. why did i just... how do i rate
[19086.97s -> 19096.84s]  this level? i want to give it a one star. he's doing his own shit and living his own life.
[19097.40s -> 19127.64s]  all right, any buttons to press? no. don't kill me. they worked hard on this. how could you say that?
[19128.44s -> 19132.34s]  yeah, i worked hard on my birdhouse there and people told me that i was stupid and it sucked.
[19132.98s -> 19137.06s]  are we gonna... will we have a couple of different standards here? is that
[19137.06s -> 19160.50s]  understood? careful. careful here. careful. careful. i can't go up there. how am i gonna
[19160.50s -> 19177.38s]  get away from that? all right, i'm good. watch out. there's the one dude there is just kind
[19177.38s -> 19183.38s]  of hanging out. this is messing up my head here. this is screwing up my brain. i have to get rid
[19183.38s -> 19207.21s]  of that thing. there we go. all right, i got through that. get rid of this snot ghost. almost
[19207.21s -> 19219.06s]  there. cock strikes again. yeah, unfortunately they tend to do that. i have to get a running
[19219.06s -> 19239.53s]  start. be careful. okay, hold on. how can i get that? this is bad. this is gonna be bad,
[19239.53s -> 19267.70s]  right? can i fall and then go to the right? i mean, yeah, i need the left. no flag either.
[19267.70s -> 19275.46s]  that was... that was close. you're right. that was a close one. get all the coins.
[19279.88s -> 19288.82s]  oh, shit. no, that's... that's not okay. that's not good. i can do the whole thing again.
[19294.06s -> 19297.58s]  no, i had... i did have a flag. i did. why does it feel so far away?
[19307.13s -> 19317.24s]  no, that's not okay. did i die in mario maker or did i like rear end somebody
[19317.32s -> 19339.77s]  in traffic? oh, no, that's not okay. that's not okay. oh, no. all right, i gotta get this again.
[19354.17s -> 19360.06s]  all right, luigi is adamant on giving me parts here for some reason. he's like,
[19360.06s -> 19372.89s]  are you sure you don't want these? are you sure? you're probably gonna need them.
[19373.45s -> 19391.37s]  just jump over everybody. all right, so can i just flip it upside down again?
[19392.09s -> 19412.60s]  or right side up, should i say? oh, oh well. is the audio delayed again? i don't know what
[19412.60s -> 19425.11s]  is with this thing. why is everybody doing minus two? i didn't... i just... i didn't do anything.
[19425.11s -> 19445.99s]  all right, ready? two. one. i don't know. i didn't see... people are abusing that now.
[19445.99s -> 19468.58s]  i'm seeing some abuse on that system. you said right side up. yeah, but i just had a slip.
[19468.58s -> 19476.17s]  i just... i wasn't... i just... whatever. i don't even... it's not explaining. i'm dead. i'm
[19476.17s -> 19497.22s]  dead. i'm dead. i'm gonna die. i'm gonna die. i'm dead. all right, float me over there. you gotta
[19497.22s -> 19509.37s]  watch out for when the little things pop. pop. it's over the coins. what does this do for me?
[19509.37s -> 19516.84s]  nothing. um, do i need to go in that? oh, look at... did you see that hitbox? i did and it was
[19516.84s -> 19525.74s]  bad. i couldn't even believe it. why is this... oh, he's like, we're gonna back problem now.
[19526.78s -> 19531.82s]  there are too many people standing on this and i... i'm too panicky to get rid of them all.
[19532.52s -> 19550.65s]  now they... it's like just rolling the dice. nobody can do that. nobody can effectively do that.
[19551.29s -> 19554.57s]  if you do something like that, you jump on a shell that's in that small quarters,
[19555.13s -> 19592.78s]  just throw dice in the air. oh. oh. oh. what? oh, it's blocked. this one's kind of hard.
[19594.49s -> 19596.57s]  i would just stand in the middle, but you can't really do that either.
[19609.35s -> 19623.14s]  greed. tilt it up? oh, shit. no, it's gonna be down. not that far down.
[19632.38s -> 19635.90s]  i've been streaming this for like five and a half hours. i haven't even asked the question yet.
[19636.78s -> 19644.14s]  so are these levels levels that were made by nintendo teams? or were they brought over
[19644.14s -> 19648.22s]  from the first game? or are these just, hey, check a look at what you can do and what you're
[19648.22s -> 19666.12s]  capable of? and they got on. made by nintendo. showing some of the new features and stuff.
[19666.12s -> 19670.60s]  that's cool. half of these mechanics were not even in mario maker 1. that makes sense.
[19686.95s -> 19696.23s]  cool. what's left to build? you know what i mean? how much left of the castle is there to do?
[19701.29s -> 19705.62s]  new building options. what is now? okay, east hall cannon, east hall doors,
[19706.42s -> 19724.73s]  and what? the red carpet? watch it turn around and you only do the front side of the castle.
[19725.29s -> 19730.90s]  it's just cut in half and i have to do the back. let's do another job.
[19734.70s -> 19738.62s]  ant trooper march. then i've done these somehow already, a bunch of them.
[19739.26s -> 19744.94s]  let's clean up ant trooper march. hope you like to use why.
[19745.96s -> 19766.89s]  good luck. why? let's run. or dash. good music, boys and girls. no, never mind.
[19766.89s -> 19783.21s]  holy fuck, this is fast. that's really fast. they ramped that up real quick. it starts off
[19783.21s -> 19801.67s]  like this and then they just drag the screen over. get out of here, luigi. i'm gonna let
[19801.67s -> 19813.10s]  luigi do the last level. just get in. i don't, i have to get over this. kind of not fair.
[19813.10s -> 19851.99s]  he's holding down. oh shit. it's too fast. oh. mario, i wish you wouldn't just grab onto ledges
[19858.63s -> 19867.98s]  like that. stop grabbing onto ledges and hit the... he just bounced twice on his butt.
[19868.86s -> 19882.98s]  he didn't even slide. he bounced. i died in the glass. you should be safe in the glass.
[19882.98s -> 19911.93s]  he should be able to die in the glass. i even followed their instructions, too. what's after
[19911.93s -> 19949.72s]  that? perfect. sweet. that was really short. a lot of money for not a lot of time. 75. almost
[19949.72s -> 19959.11s]  there. the castle is almost done. we're so close. fly-by-night clown car. it's not
[19959.11s -> 19973.21s]  one of those fly-around-and-shoot-things levels. all right, gotta kill bowser. should be easy
[19973.21s -> 19986.60s]  enough. i blew it. oh, i want to restart. just do that again. uh, best song. again.
[19995.90s -> 20017.30s]  one bowser's. triple shot. all right, let me get a good pace here. talk... i should have gotten hit
[20017.30s -> 20036.52s]  there. it's a miraculous way i did not receive damage. already time to go. you have to play
[20036.52s -> 20069.70s]  the panic music on me. what is that? he's dead? one bowser's. i'm just playing cuphead. speaking
[20069.70s -> 20075.74s]  of cuphead, when does the new cuphead stuff come out? this dlc that's primed. soon here,
[20075.74s -> 20100.92s]  right? is there gonna be one real answer in this? i guess not. the doors and the cannon.
[20101.56s -> 20108.42s]  and that's all there is left. you know, there's probably like a cherry you put on top or like
[20108.42s -> 20121.82s]  a whip cream or something. no date set? just sometime in 2019. cool. i will be into that.
[20123.05s -> 20127.34s]  lava rising three stars. 200 bucks. don't even need to read the description because i know
[20127.34s -> 20144.92s]  what it is. there's just some finesse work to do after this. yeah, i want to try the
[20144.92s -> 20155.08s]  multiplayer too. once it's not day one, i would put some time into this. the reason why i wanted
[20155.08s -> 20158.92s]  to do the single player first is because last time i jumped right into expert levels
[20158.92s -> 20168.98s]  and i wanted to quit the game forever. and i did. that's close. i'd like to get back into
[20168.98s -> 20173.06s]  the groove of playing a mario game before i do the hardest levels i can possibly imagine.
[20173.94s -> 20186.18s]  well that's ways more. what should i do? oh my god, the lava comes up. right. shoot shoot
[20187.14s -> 20206.94s]  what's that? someone link the i quit clip from a... i did not think that was gonna go that fast.
[20220.63s -> 20234.65s]  was there an actual i quit moment? no, that's real. hold on. no no no no. i'm
[20234.65s -> 20260.82s]  talking about from like two years ago. dude, this is the wall. here comes the wall.
[20261.54s -> 20266.02s]  this is the wall. i'm at like 77 percent where i made it to the uh to the gear check.
[20282.49s -> 20298.58s]  holy fuck. does it go down? don't leave me behind here. oh my god. oh no i was on it.
[20302.18s -> 20319.24s]  no i have to do the whole fucking thing again. it's just a line on the screen. it's a loading
[20319.24s -> 20331.61s]  screen. you're not even gonna have luigi actually do something? they just let you win.
[20332.17s -> 20347.62s]  there's nothing else. and it's an actual just full-on win. uh okay. well oh but they get
[20347.62s -> 20352.87s]  they look what they do to you though. they put a luigi flag on it just to remind you forever.
[20353.59s -> 20361.83s]  i'll go back and do it as mario. the wops and chain chomps and passable castle
[20363.94s -> 20383.14s]  pick up buzzy shells with y and wear them. but that ain't gonna happen. i've got like
[20383.14s -> 20386.82s]  a lot of gas in my like upper gi track. it won't come out. i want to burp but i
[20386.82s -> 20391.91s]  feel like if i burp too hard, if i try i'll throw up. you know what i'm saying? you guys
[20391.91s -> 20412.22s]  have been there before? too much information? i did i gave i gave you barely any information
[20412.22s -> 20430.09s]  there actually. that could have been way more explicit. how do i get you up there?
[20430.09s -> 20454.90s]  you don't come up here? oh god just do it! just do it! just go! just do it! i know. i
[20454.90s -> 20469.43s]  don't know if i should have done that. i definitely should not have done that. but
[20469.43s -> 20479.48s]  get the flag. forget about the coins. they're not important.
[20484.54s -> 20493.93s]  hmm i could bump it up but i can't. i don't have the helmet anymore.
[20501.94s -> 20527.58s]  y. that's fantastic. ends all the way over there. great. give it to me. come on back.
[20527.58s -> 20537.21s]  big enough to get it. so i think i have to kill bowser with the guy's face. this is
[20537.21s -> 20564.98s]  gonna be annoying. you can't go through here, can you? i can still hear him. got him.
[20571.78s -> 20577.35s]  easier than i thought. i thought i had to get him hit by the the whomps. but apparently
[20577.35s -> 20587.35s]  not. just had to hit the axe. six fifty six sixty fifth. six six feet. i can't even talk.
[20587.35s -> 20604.22s]  83. any more jobs? so what happens when we finish this? i still have like 20 levels left to do.
[20605.34s -> 20613.64s]  lava bubble limbo. create an ocean of lava bubbles but now i can't get through it.
[20613.64s -> 20630.20s]  get through i'll pay you. i don't remember peaches castle having artillery. there's a
[20630.20s -> 20644.33s]  new thing? there's a new development? so what's the deal here? i just have to
[20645.78s -> 20650.46s]  swim with this? just get through it. but get through what?
[20651.26s -> 20683.51s]  fire flower. nice. i just have to swim with them. okay well. easy enough. that fish was freaking me
[20683.51s -> 20694.73s]  out. all right so i made it. now that they get bigger i get it. they just make it more annoying
[20694.73s -> 20702.68s]  to have to weed through. i really should be more in front. i was dilly dallying too much.
[20703.64s -> 20740.30s]  not gonna be good. double bounce. that was good. wasn't that bad. it was pretty easy. help. i can't
[20740.30s -> 20749.19s]  hold my breath anymore. we'll stop doing that. you don't have to do that to impress me. you
[20749.19s -> 20756.15s]  don't have to do that. let it go. i was still building the castle. we are. i think we're done.
[20756.79s -> 20761.21s]  i think there's just finishing touches because we're. what else is there to build?
[20761.85s -> 20768.65s]  you got something else for me? all right we're making great progress. i need a new word to
[20768.65s -> 20773.53s]  describe how great this new section is. how about splendorificana zarivalis.
[20774.33s -> 20783.27s]  we have a new building option. oh the roof. the roof of the east hall. okay. all right.
[20785.93s -> 20794.47s]  okay that's fine. dry bones lava lurker. reach the goal after defeating all the dry bones.
[20804.09s -> 20812.26s]  i'll hold my breath for. let's see. is it water in this one? well there's lava.
[20816.14s -> 20819.18s]  they're collecting taxes from the residents of mushroom kingdom.
[20819.82s -> 20826.46s]  that doesn't sound nice. why would i collect taxes from them? it's not like king mario
[20826.46s -> 20838.15s]  and like queen. all right. you know what? who's the queen? there is no king and queen. why is
[20838.15s -> 20866.70s]  there a princess? and is there a prince? does it drop? don't get it yet. i don't know.
[20867.26s -> 20878.25s]  the mushroom kingdom is a principality. bowser is the king. bowser is not the king.
[20885.43s -> 20891.85s]  who are all the toads? are they like are they supposed to be you know servants of the castle?
[20891.85s -> 20917.32s]  butlers? and but where is the king and queen? there isn't one. whose goddamn castle is this?
[20921.72s -> 20942.15s]  princess toadstool. but who was before princess toadstool? blinking block blitz. two stars.
[20958.15s -> 20962.95s]  there's a plumber in a non-toileted society and you're upset about the missing
[20963.03s -> 20978.46s]  monarchy. there's definitely toilets. there's definitely toilets. we're about to install them.
[20978.46s -> 21022.68s]  i hate cat mario. i don't like it at all. where's dog mario? i'm already losing time.
[21022.68s -> 21037.30s]  get in there. i'm gonna get inside. ready? one two three click. stop doing like the m bison move.
[21041.08s -> 21043.64s]  i hate the cat. i don't like the cat. i don't like the cat. i hate the cat.
[21044.52s -> 21049.27s]  i'm not gonna pick the power up app. i'm just gonna do the level without the cat.
[21050.07s -> 21085.29s]  all right i'm good. i want that 10 bucks. just give me the give to me.
[21112.58s -> 21113.38s]  where's the flag?
[21130.38s -> 21147.02s]  cat levels stone level are better than cat levels. let's pick that up. no. and you
[21147.02s -> 21172.84s]  attach to every single fucking wall. i don't want to grab every wall mario. i tried to
[21172.84s -> 21190.06s]  grab the tree. i hate this character. i hate it. i'm gonna lose again. no i'm not. i'm throwing
[21190.06s -> 21197.46s]  off. i'm getting the costume off. i just want to oh my god i it's the costume. it's the god.
[21197.46s -> 21204.28s]  vader it's the goblin. it's the goblin. i swear to god i i never want to see this
[21204.28s -> 21238.90s]  stupid fucking garfield looking shithead ever again. now you can do yoga. great. get in
[21238.90s -> 21272.98s]  there. you're as mad at mario as i got with uncharted on crushing. what's that mean? dive
[21272.98s -> 21295.13s]  bomb. rotten pro. are there a use for the dive bomb? what's it there for? let's go eat some
[21295.13s -> 21311.10s]  rotten mushrooms. getting mad at uncharted. i've never played uncharted. is that possible?
[21311.10s -> 21319.42s]  no mistakes. no mistakes. here we go. i'm gonna do it first try. i'm gonna get everything
[21319.42s -> 21330.25s]  perfect. every coin go. since when do mushrooms go to the left side? it's never happened.
[21330.81s -> 21360.76s]  there's too many. why are they going to the left?
[21372.82s -> 21404.39s]  i was on it. i missed the coins. who cares. do joe rogan rant about oh oh okay mushrooms.
[21406.44s -> 21417.35s]  88 88 percent. we are so damn close. i can feel it. koopa clown car coin collecting.
[21418.98s -> 21428.41s]  reach the goal after grabbing all 50 coins. this will get us to 90 percent. all right
[21428.41s -> 21434.06s]  i'm gonna calm down now and i'm gonna just relax and we're just gonna play. all right.
[21449.59s -> 21499.50s]  it's not working. where did this come from? where did that come from? why is a mushroom in one?
[21499.50s -> 21517.29s]  no no. get back in. okay seriously. i have 25 seconds. oh get those. no don't. it doesn't
[21517.29s -> 21523.05s]  matter. can i break this? i have 17 seconds. i gotta get all the other ones. little stragglers.

[21629.08s -> 21646.22s]  i was trying to jump on his head so i could go in there. yeah. damn he really is bad at this.
[21646.22s -> 21659.98s]  no i just i jumped over it and i was trying to. 90 percent. the darkness lifts. use a dim
[21659.98s -> 21670.02s]  light to make. get over it. wall jumps are great. get over it. if you mess up you'll fall into a
[21670.02s -> 21682.92s]  lake of boiling poison. this haha i suck at a kids game joke isn't funny. mario's no joke.
[21685.13s -> 21702.90s]  mario does not mess around. these games are made with skill in mind. um okay. i have just
[21702.90s -> 21719.16s]  barely saved my life. i'm gonna wait until the last second. into the claw. oh my god. okay.
[21719.32s -> 21746.23s]  not in the poison. easy. where the hell is this? they did say wall jumping. so that's what you
[21746.23s -> 21751.93s]  have to do. i am not going to go on the other side of that. 30 coins. someone else will get
[21751.93s -> 21756.57s]  them. when you load up your copy you can just you can go on the other side and get that.
[21756.57s -> 21788.98s]  what is going on? does it go back up? shit. all right. that was tricky but not that bad.
[21789.70s -> 21801.59s]  not that bad. i'm still gonna have money. what's the point of money after you build
[21802.55s -> 21808.04s]  everything? because i think that's it. unless there's some other random stuff that is
[21808.04s -> 21819.03s]  possible. i don't know what to do with the money. 91. oh everyone's stressed. that means
[21819.03s -> 21826.07s]  that something's wrong. oh man. oh this is bad. big red. we got a problem. i shouldn't say this
[21826.07s -> 21834.23s]  out loud. so here. oh total eclipse. i can't believe it. every last member of the crew
[21834.23s -> 21838.87s]  was kidnapped during lunch. please you've got to go and rescue them all before the chief notices
[21838.87s -> 21862.71s]  and docks our pay. get all five toads. i need every toad. i'm gonna go down left. no i'm not.

[21894.74s -> 21903.88s]  trapped there. he was supposed to be a hero. he died fucking instantly. he didn't even know
[21903.88s -> 21930.33s]  he died. it was horrible. it just seared his head off. up here. all right. this time don't
[21930.33s -> 21941.16s]  run. don't rush. holy crap. holy crap. where did that come from? oh my god. what the
[21941.16s -> 21946.28s]  hell is happening in my brain? it's like the my brain is moving faster than things on the
[21946.60s -> 21989.11s]  screen. it'd be nice if i got one of these. am i tall? i'm gonna like crush my head.
[21993.77s -> 22012.06s]  okay now just walk across them slowly. thank you. toad number two. that leaves us with bottom
[22012.06s -> 22020.23s]  left and top left. and then i got them all. what is this gonna do? rush twice.
[22020.87s -> 22037.21s]  thank you for that. appreciate it. who died? be faster next time. this doesn't hit us, right?

[22083.05s -> 22086.57s]  i try to do a gotcha moment there where i jump up and it instantly turns back on.
[22087.53s -> 22115.05s]  got them all. let's get the hell out of here. wait what? i get the hell out of here. who did i
[22115.05s -> 22123.86s]  miss? who's still who? who did i not get? didn't i already go down here? i remember like jumping
[22123.86s -> 22133.69s]  over this. did i not go this way? oh all the way to the right here. oh here you go.
[22133.69s -> 22155.11s]  i just don't want anybody to get hurt. someone's gonna get just clubbed by one of those 30.
[22155.83s -> 22179.35s]  that's a lot of coins. all right. slow. this is like a seven minute level. i don't want to
[22179.43s -> 22190.31s]  blow it. there's a boss at the end of this. that was way easier than i thought. i just
[22190.31s -> 22214.30s]  dropped them all in there. put on a face cam? all right fine. there. all right. don't worry.
[22214.30s -> 22234.22s]  good to see you. let me move this down. good. old joke. oh it's because of this. hold on.
[22235.54s -> 22250.15s]  i don't care. i don't want to do it. they're all back. you rescued the toads. you did it.
[22250.79s -> 22262.49s]  congratulations. now paint it. my crew finally came back. was there a lazy toad convention in
[22262.49s -> 22271.58s]  the bathroom or something? confirmed bathrooms. the person that said that earlier. mario's a
[22271.58s -> 22284.10s]  plumber. everything's done. we have new building options now. stained glass 2000. all right. so
[22284.10s -> 22299.21s]  it is the stained glass. that's the finishing touch. a bathroom without a toilet? would it
[22299.21s -> 22311.99s]  be a bathroom? i mean i guess if it had bathtubs in it. this is expensive bullshit that requires
[22311.99s -> 22336.07s]  completing everything. well i'm pretty close. really. just the darkness is killing me. i just
[22337.03s -> 22342.07s]  landed them. holy shit. something just dropped. oh man. all right. all right. slow down.
[22342.87s -> 22363.98s]  i thought we were going to keep going right. this is why i skipped this one.
[22364.62s -> 22385.08s]  he sees 10 coins and immediately beefs it. what was it immediately? i mean to be fair
[22385.08s -> 22398.20s]  it is a pretty prize because you need the currency. coming back. i didn't try to get it.
[22398.20s -> 22423.46s]  is that gonna come down? holy shit it is. i could have jumped and got it. how the hell. i hear
[22423.46s -> 22439.32s]  something. what do i hear? i hear something. oh my god. it's saws. 50. oh i want it so bad.
[22440.44s -> 22461.32s]  nope. luigi can have that 50. yeah. i missed a 50. it hurts to miss a 50. it does.
[22461.96s -> 22471.98s]  unfortunately. angry angry sun. cloudy with a chance of gamma ray burst. i recommend using
[22471.98s -> 22478.73s]  the cloud cover to avoid getting a nasty sun burn. can you do face cam? sure i'll do it for
[22478.73s -> 22502.60s]  a second. i'm not fixing the audio because like it's gonna take too long. wait for the wait
[22502.60s -> 22540.90s]  wait wait. all right. hold on. that's better. hi. if i had just paid attention to the game.
[22582.94s -> 22611.11s]  oh a hamster. i don't do cam man. i don't do cam. i don't do cam dude. sorry. all right. i'm
[22611.11s -> 22624.95s]  it's fucking my brain. this is this level's. just watch the sun. give it to me please. all
[22624.95s -> 22632.62s]  right. relax. bring it back. i want. why am i reading chat and walking off of a fucking cliff
[22632.62s -> 22641.61s]  at the same time? what would the purpose of that be? get out of here you fucking banjo
[22641.61s -> 22659.91s]  kazooie looking dick. that was uncalled for. yeah but where has he been? all right. where has
[22659.91s -> 22677.19s]  he been for 20 years? he walked out and didn't come back. holy shit. i can still do it. greed
[22677.19s -> 22683.78s]  is killing me here. greed is killing me. it killed me. all right face cam on for this one.
[22683.78s -> 22722.12s]  watch out for the sun. watch out for the sun. i'm thinking about getting the coins.
[22728.54s -> 22763.99s]  oh shit. where's this going? the sun's just being annoying now. get up there. fuck did i go?
[22763.99s -> 22773.69s]  oh. i'm trying to jump to get the coins. words first. marticle. marticle. vertical mario mvp.
[22786.49s -> 22806.14s]  all right. get out of here. how much is left? there are a shitload of levels left. what happens
[22806.14s -> 22819.77s]  when we build the castle? reach the goal in the koopa troopa car. do a multiplayer before
[22819.77s -> 22823.53s]  it's too late. well it's not going to be too late because we're going to do it again.
[22824.17s -> 22846.57s]  it's actually a car. how do i drive it? holy. this is awesome. imagine the levels
[22847.21s -> 22856.26s]  that we'll get out of this. somebody will recreate the whole track. i love this level.
[22856.26s -> 22859.70s]  this is one of those levels in the original that just played itself and it was like
[22859.70s -> 22865.94s]  impossible to lose. you just had to drive and left the show. remember the songs? these are the
[22865.94s -> 22882.30s]  best. hey. you can go up or down. right on top. yeah that's a full letter grade up. you're
[22882.30s -> 22893.16s]  right. if this was like a b minus so far. like a b. it's now an a. although i don't know if i
[22893.16s -> 22907.16s]  would classify this as a b minus. it's just fun. buzzy the movie the book of the ride.
[22912.15s -> 22916.95s]  reach the goal to grabbing 80 coins. click coins while trying not to fall to your doom.
[22916.95s -> 22933.83s]  once you grab buzzy beetle's shell you can throw it up. all right. street fighter the movie
[22933.83s -> 22956.38s]  the game. all right. reach the goal to grab and at least 80 coins. let's go. uh what? right.
[22956.38s -> 22968.92s]  that's what it wants me to do. red the needle. nice. come on. do it again. idiot. can i?
[22980.57s -> 22990.52s]  i was so... i was staring at that 50. all i saw were dollar signs and nothing else.
[22990.52s -> 23000.63s]  i really am like a money bug. it's like a light source. i just saw money and i was like
[23000.71s -> 23010.47s]  money. give it to me. money. i don't understand what the hell they want me to do.
[23011.11s -> 23030.17s]  thread it. oh shit. all right. i'm all right. no. give me. i want to catch it. here we go.
[23030.89s -> 23042.97s]  perfect. get away from me. did i do it? 105. yep. how did he get that 30 down there?
[23042.97s -> 23058.28s]  what is up with that? what is going on here? what did it do? what did it do? what did that
[23058.28s -> 23076.10s]  do? there's a door. should i go in the door? oh no. that's the normal door. it stopped the
[23076.10s -> 23089.54s]  conveyor belt. i have enough money. we got work to do. now here's the thing. the re... how this
[23089.54s -> 23101.66s]  is possible to continue to... it's probably gonna be 10 plus hammers there. only five.
[23101.66s -> 23111.38s]  never mind. construction has started on the stained glass. okay. there's even more jobs to
[23111.38s -> 23121.69s]  do here. let me see. let's go all the way to the end for a second. 19. no. we already did these
[23123.59s -> 23135.16s]  here. invincible wind sprinter is currently the last one we have here. 100 coins under the sea.
[23140.34s -> 23150.74s]  grab all 100 coins. do it? no. i'll do the last couple. if they're still available, and
[23150.74s -> 23159.45s]  this kind of ends, you only have to do 60 or 70 levels. and i'll try some of the crazy
[23159.45s -> 23167.29s]  ones. and then i'll do a multiplayer night where i'll play a bunch of levels and then
[23167.29s -> 23172.87s]  do some multiplayer. i'll probably do that. let's see what's today. tomorrow's movie night.
[23175.37s -> 23182.30s]  so after tomorrow, i got... i want to do dark souls randomizer and then...
[23184.06s -> 23190.34s]  we'll do... all right. i got a plan. we're gonna do that. that got a lot lined up.
[23190.34s -> 23197.78s]  do i have to do this? i mean, i don't... you talk about the single player thing? no, not necessarily,
[23197.78s -> 23203.54s]  but i think it's kind of fun. plus, like i said before, i don't just want to jump into mario maker.
[23203.54s -> 23210.34s]  i want to, like, just get some good hours in just doing the single player and then
[23210.34s -> 23226.46s]  go hard on the multiplayer stuff. i'm going to do more cook serve delicious.
[23226.62s -> 23251.42s]  whenever, really. don't have a plan. and this is a relaxing level after the weird ones.
[23251.42s -> 23257.43s]  which, i'm probably going to do the enemies and items randomizer. it was heavily requested
[23257.43s -> 23264.36s]  long ago. seems like fun. so i'll probably do that. i don't think... i don't know if i'm
[23264.36s -> 23269.14s]  gonna do it with any other person, though. i feel like doing that with two people is hard
[23269.14s -> 23274.10s]  because if somebody dies, don't you have to, like, restart everything and, like, re-sum them
[23274.10s -> 23277.86s]  and stuff? i was gonna just kind of do a night where i do a bunch of weird things,
[23278.34s -> 23285.75s]  i was gonna just kind of do a night where i do a bunch of random weird ones.
[23286.79s -> 23298.82s]  but yeah, that's next week. well, i'll probably do tuesday, wednesday...
[23299.86s -> 23305.19s]  i gotta do... i gotta work on that carnival shit, though. i'm probably gonna have, like,
[23305.19s -> 23321.03s]  a meeting. i'll figure it out. the world's greatest cannon ride. that one is doing it
[23321.03s -> 23344.31s]  for me. i want to try it. termicorp board meeting. no. you see, i wouldn't be able
[23344.31s -> 23351.80s]  to do any of the things i'm doing right now if i had... remember mario maker 1? i couldn't
[23351.80s -> 23358.97s]  even make small jumps. i'll be ready for the the new levels in the multiplayer the next time i do
[23358.97s -> 23400.49s]  this. come on, get out of the way. gee, psycho! uh-oh, didn't have a good view. don't blow it
[23400.49s -> 23419.08s]  right before the... get up top. no, don't get up top. what do i do? oh, here. how do i get
[23419.08s -> 23454.87s]  that? like this? i got greedy and it was a mistake so far. don't die here. why do the bombs look so
[23454.87s -> 23466.39s]  weird? do they? to anyone who bought germa stock during the dread hall stream three months
[23466.39s -> 23474.22s]  ago, sell for profit. are you gonna sell my stock before the carnival? i think that would be
[23474.22s -> 23489.56s]  a mistake. what's the carnival? uh, oh yeah, that's right. i probably should talk about it
[23489.56s -> 23494.54s]  more often. at some point in the end of august or into somewhere into september,
[23495.42s -> 23500.54s]  i'm currently working with a robotics team and i'm making an entire twitch controls
[23501.96s -> 23508.65s]  carnival games stream. dunk tanks, claw games, and it's happening at some point in around
[23508.65s -> 23520.74s]  september. how long is that stream gonna be? it's gonna be at least four to six hours long.
[23520.74s -> 23529.66s]  has to be. and i'll be on the dunk tank yet. this is a project that is a very very long
[23529.66s -> 23533.98s]  time in the making. i really wanted this to happen like back in like april or march, but
[23536.07s -> 23547.34s]  kind of just didn't. but now it is. it's finally gonna happen. how many votes will it take to dunk
[23547.34s -> 23553.10s]  you? well, that's the thing. i don't really want to talk about it too much because i'd rather some
[23553.10s -> 23559.58s]  of it, at least most of it, be a surprise and more uh more than just like, hey here's everything
[23559.58s -> 23565.67s]  that's gonna happen. because there's a lot of shit that's gonna happen on that stream
[23565.67s -> 23570.31s]  that at least is planned to happen. so i'd rather not just be like, and here's this is
[23570.31s -> 23572.23s]  gonna happen and this is gonna happen and then this is gonna happen and then this is gonna
[23572.23s -> 23580.18s]  happen at the end. but you will have- i will tell you very specific dates, very specific times,
[23581.06s -> 23584.98s]  weeks in advance, if not potentially a month in advance of when the stream is gonna happen.
[23585.70s -> 23600.44s]  how did i do that without- i was barely paying attention to that one. million dollar joke.
[23602.44s -> 23609.74s]  not that much, but um for those of you- i won't give- no no no that's not- no i don't
[23609.74s -> 23619.21s]  want to do that. no, it's too early. too early to talk about that. you'll see. you'll see.
[23619.77s -> 23647.21s]  uh oh. 10? oh i could have got it right there. is there gonna be a clown? just know this.
[23649.51s -> 23657.54s]  i'm going as hard as i possibly can on this stream. i don't need- i don't want to say
[23657.54s -> 23672.65s]  anything else. that's all i really need to say. i can't have that just empty here,
[23672.65s -> 23687.67s]  you know what i mean? i have to do it. climbing twister cave. do you ever feel
[23687.67s -> 23696.02s]  nervous about doing big streams like that before them? no, not really. because it's
[23696.02s -> 23702.06s]  just like that shit that i've- oh come on i missed those. because by the time that you see
[23702.06s -> 23709.50s]  something on stream, i've probably gone over it a dozen times. i probably like talked about it
[23709.50s -> 23714.94s]  or planned it for weeks in advance. so i want to do it and i want to get going and i want
[23714.94s -> 23722.92s]  to do it now. you know what i mean? usually like at least a week or two in advance a
[23722.92s -> 23726.44s]  lot of those like random streams like that that would happen. oh come on i can get that.
[23727.24s -> 23734.47s]  do the people helping you actually know what you're doing? oh yeah and they're very much
[23734.47s -> 23745.08s]  included and on board. they're very excited about it too because it's just hopefully it's
[23745.08s -> 23755.50s]  just going to be a really fun project to do. really? are you going to come out like that?
[23756.76s -> 23769.14s]  well do it again. that's not a good idea. do it from here. it's 30 coins i have to try.
[23769.70s -> 23777.22s]  jesus i don't think i can make this jump from here. god damn it i knew that was going to
[23777.22s -> 23787.43s]  happen. thank the people helping with this for us. yeah you- they're- you will know-
[23788.95s -> 23794.98s]  you'll know exactly who they are because this is gonna- they'll be very- it'll be very evident
[23794.98s -> 23815.34s]  on who is- i did it again because the people that are working on this it's- they have like
[23815.34s -> 23825.35s]  a legit mobile unit. you know it's not- it's not like the last big big big project i did
[23825.35s -> 23830.47s]  which was essentially- it was germa rumble live was the last huge project that i really
[23830.71s -> 23838.73s]  really did. that was me and like my friends and a couple of people. this is a bunch of people that
[23838.73s -> 23844.54s]  do this kind of shit for a living so- and it has to be that way because there's a lot going on
[23844.54s -> 23857.58s]  in this stream that there has to be a lot of people essentially working on it. i gotta be
[23857.58s -> 23862.30s]  careful i have no health. yes i called it health but that's kind of what it is.
[23863.26s -> 23867.85s]  am i gonna put an act on or is it gonna be- it's i mean it's kind of just gonna be me.
[23868.57s -> 23890.70s]  holy fuck i thought that was an enemy one two three go i'll do that get it
[23893.40s -> 23902.18s]  really i've been moving real quick haven't i i haven't been moving fast how much more is there
[23903.34s -> 23923.05s]  oh yeah yay no he's killing everybody holy shit at least i have the time back
[23926.90s -> 23940.92s]  don't b come on press b try to bring a bomb up there i feel like that'll help
[23952.70s -> 23953.50s]  no give me a new one
[23957.50s -> 23967.30s]  no that's not gonna work i needed that extra hit for this he's kind of just has to kill
[23967.30s -> 23999.93s]  everything otherwise i'll fly into him i'll just leave one i could probably go now okay one two
[23999.93s -> 24019.86s]  three whatever the courtroom stream that i mentioned on the podcast we just couldn't get
[24019.86s -> 24025.75s]  it done it just wasn't gonna happen we had we were in contact with a couple of different
[24025.75s -> 24032.39s]  courts and a couple of different groups that wanted to kind of do it but they flaked out both
[24032.39s -> 24046.01s]  of them essentially at the very last second they were like eh stop returning emails and it was
[24046.01s -> 24053.22s]  good we were gonna have uh santa's uh oh i'm taking taking down the fourth wall here
[24054.02s -> 24063.02s]  um media meteor showdown meowser showdown what the hell is this the chief has been abducted

[24077.05s -> 24085.74s]  perfect for it there's gonna be christmas be music in the background while he sang all of
[24085.74s -> 24095.26s]  his lines there's gonna be character witnesses it's gonna be ridiculous why well because he's
[24095.26s -> 24116.81s]  like santa's magic fucking attorney so he's of course he's gonna be a christmas spirit kind
[24116.81s -> 24130.33s]  of thing we had a lot of plans for that too it was so disappointing that's a really cool looking
[24130.33s -> 24144.70s]  enemy click click click click click click click click out i've never played mario 3d world
[24144.70s -> 24151.03s]  before how do you beat bowser did jump on his head i've never beat bowser as just me

[24350.34s -> 24367.98s]  gimmick why i tried to hit the one time that i pressed the down button and it doesn't work
[24370.02s -> 24385.00s]  i'm so ready i'm so ready i think i've been pressing on these buttons too hard for so long
[24387.80s -> 24393.62s]  that i drained the battery faster like i think i've been pressing too many buttons that have
[24393.62s -> 24402.44s]  drained the battery faster it feels a little less fluid i have to shake up my controllers to
[24402.44s -> 24407.85s]  recharge them just wait till they start doing that shit i can't wait you know those like
[24407.85s -> 24412.09s]  flashlights that you shake and they get charged that's gonna happen pretty soon with wireless
[24412.09s -> 24431.16s]  controllers you're probably gonna get out of the way try just to step on his hands
[24432.04s -> 24447.96s]  i'm just fucking panicking right now i'll just go all right here we go i'm not gonna get the
[24447.96s -> 24468.58s]  coin this time i'm just gonna beat the level i'm not gonna be an idiot up okey dokey turn
[24468.58s -> 24491.98s]  let's go there's a lot of unnecessary animals that i just ran over just get out of the car
[24492.62s -> 24496.95s]  please don't tell me the lava is gonna be right here i'm gonna go right into it
[24515.08s -> 24526.30s]  oh shit give it to me how do i climb this
[24536.23s -> 24563.70s]  i what am i doing give me the pow no give me the pow stop all right throw it at him
[24563.70s -> 24607.74s]  why is he a cat too why are we both cats coins beautiful there's more i think i beat the
[24607.74s -> 24617.21s]  story i think i did it i completed the first time ever in over 10 years i just beat a mario
[24617.21s -> 24636.84s]  game in quotes i did it i rescued the chief fresh air finally i owe you one mario
[24638.90s -> 24642.49s]  stained glass is finished we're almost done there's one more thing to do
[24646.62s -> 24662.23s]  100 that's it now that was just a model now zoom out we got to do the whole castle see
[24662.23s -> 24671.14s]  you in 500 hours my name could go down in history for this but now is not the time for that let's
[24671.14s -> 24701.94s]  go to get princess peach cutscene mario you haven't changed clothes in like seven or eight
[24701.94s -> 24729.83s]  days you aimed those at bowser when he came to try to kill you all we even he even says
[24729.83s -> 24740.18s]  thank you for playing thank you for playing because they're fireworks you don't think if
[24740.18s -> 24745.22s]  you get a firework one of the big ones shot directly in your face it's something bad wouldn't
[24745.22s -> 24754.98s]  happen is he gonna press the button again and redo them are we in an infinite loop hey look
[24754.98s -> 24786.23s]  at that that was fun i think we're chasing him that was really fun seven hours of six to seven
[24786.23s -> 24799.08s]  hours and there's still like 20 or 30 levels that are there i'm gonna check and see after
[24799.08s -> 24819.24s]  credits what it looks like now i'm ready for super expert mode yeah that'll have to be for
[24819.32s -> 24826.12s]  another night though i'm gonna go check out the other levels that were the
[24826.12s -> 24839.58s]  final ones though isn't super expert gone actually i think it's just an endless mode right
[24840.30s -> 24864.22s]  it's no longer is it normal hard super hard i like this rendition they removed 100 lives
[24864.22s -> 24870.98s]  with the difficulties the same that makes sense i kind of liked the 100 lives thing though
[24872.41s -> 24879.32s]  it gave you that pressure that you only had 100 tries to get somewhere it's kind of
[24879.32s -> 24884.74s]  interesting although if you did run into one of those levels during the 100 mario challenge
[24885.70s -> 24890.42s]  if you run into one of the troll levels that guaranteed you were going to lose like 40 times
[24890.42s -> 24904.39s]  i mean that did happen didn't it you could skip yeah you could skip that's right that's
[24904.39s -> 24918.33s]  true the co-op sounds fun when it actually starts to work right isn't there isn't it not
[24918.33s -> 24924.92s]  that great right now didn't they not even add a bunch of the co-op multiplayer features
[24924.92s -> 24959.32s]  into the game yet no online with friends until later how much later you gotta buy it i thought
[24959.32s -> 24971.53s]  you just had to have the nintendo online pass thing well that was cute i want to go back and
[24971.53s -> 24983.16s]  see oh i got the hard hat it can actually be in builder mario super hammer wait you've earned a
[24983.16s -> 24990.92s]  new part you can use it in the super mario 3d world game style in course maker so you have
[24990.92s -> 24995.72s]  to play through the whole thing to get the super hammer congratulations on completing peach's
[24995.72s -> 24999.32s]  castle you can make all kinds of courses like the ones you played in story mode head over the
[24999.32s -> 25019.29s]  course maker and bring your ideas to life where's peach is she here is peach like on the level
[25024.90s -> 25040.42s]  what's your problem thanks mario oh new job from princess peach i think that's what he just
[25040.42s -> 25051.48s]  said let's go builder mario clear the way with the super hammer you need to only create a
[25051.48s -> 25055.08s]  builder box with up and why could you give that a try and see if you can reach the
[25055.08s -> 25064.34s]  goal this is from peach and i got a gear so this is the super secret princess peach end
[25064.34s -> 25074.58s]  of the video game after the credits post credit scene oh shit what the hell all right hold on
[25074.58s -> 25089.13s]  what this is crazy so you can build blocks and i only have three i guess i can have more than
[25089.13s -> 25106.46s]  three there's a lot of cool use cases for this oh you can only have okay you can only
[25106.46s -> 25130.78s]  have a certain amount dig mario dig reflexes like a goddamn animal can i yeah wait there's
[25130.78s -> 25148.33s]  something over here now i miss the mario has the hammer he didn't really have a hammer anymore
[25148.33s -> 25154.60s]  does he they put mario in all kinds of like fursuits but they don't really you don't utilize
[25154.60s -> 25179.40s]  his hammer anymore what is this the wall well he has it now that oh this hurts you right
[25180.12s -> 25205.66s]  right oh look out can't whoa all right well they can't be killed can they be boxed
[25205.66s -> 25231.62s]  no i just slingshot it down that hole i went so fast down that hole get over here
[25238.22s -> 25261.42s]  box it up again please thank you okay oh because i hit the wall that's why
[25263.42s -> 25274.36s]  all right don't screw this up again please so what am i doing wrong here you have to block
[25274.36s -> 25301.51s]  them off yeah that worked cool mechanic just jump over them do try this level i'm not going
[25301.51s -> 25310.34s]  to do any online levels tonight doll the princess pete's dress cool i'm gonna be wrapping
[25310.34s -> 25319.48s]  it up here seven hours probably take about 40 30 40 minutes to the bits i'm getting a little
[25319.48s -> 25327.18s]  tired but i am going to do a multiplayer and we're gonna do it again we're gonna do it
[25335.51s -> 25342.36s]  that was fun just to do all that i've had that was i loved that and now i got the necessary skill
[25342.36s -> 25346.84s]  set to be able to play online and do the levels and do the and that also gives time for people
[25346.84s -> 25351.88s]  to make some stuff there is stuff that already exists i'm sure that's great good luck because
[25351.88s -> 25355.24s]  multiplayer is wonky and not that great but that's what i mean maybe over the next
[25356.73s -> 25363.37s]  three or four days right maybe they'll fix out kink out some of the bugs but i'm ready for
[25363.37s -> 25374.66s]  the online stuff the other story levels yeah i mean maybe i'll work here's okay here uh listen
[25375.22s -> 25380.98s]  let me just slow down and then use my words clearly because i'm talking over myself speaking
[25380.98s -> 25388.49s]  somehow uh i will warm up with some of the harder ones here and then that i'm going to
[25388.49s -> 25393.13s]  do that for less than like probably 20 30 minutes and then we'll spend a good like
[25393.13s -> 25400.39s]  regular stream time between like six to eight hours doing all the online stuff i'm ready
[25402.17s -> 25407.54s]  but it can't happen tomorrow because tomorrow is the green screen movie encore night again if
[25407.54s -> 25410.26s]  you do not have that this is the last chance you're going to get probably the last time
[25410.26s -> 25417.62s]  i'm going to talk about it until obviously the stream is tomorrow did i explore everything i
[25417.62s -> 25427.27s]  think i saw all this secret stuff no i didn't thank you for saving the chief we couldn't have
[25427.27s -> 25430.63s]  done it without you that said mario you could probably get into that pipe you forgot
[25430.63s -> 25442.14s]  rid of that piranha creeper and look to a tomorrow i might just do this tomorrow because
[25442.14s -> 25452.46s]  it depends how long the movie night is you know you know what you know because the movie
[25453.02s -> 25460.46s]  the encore movie night is only going to be a couple hours that's not going to be that long
[25462.52s -> 25477.66s]  so why not either do that first and then just do mario maker again that makes sense i think
[25478.30s -> 25482.25s]  because it's not like i don't want to turn the stream on and turn it off in like an
[25482.33s -> 25491.91s]  hour and 25 minutes all right that's the plan if for some crazy reason the movie the green
[25491.91s -> 25495.91s]  screen night takes like four or five hours which i don't think there's no way it will
[25498.73s -> 25502.25s]  we'll just uh do the multiplayer stuff tomorrow we'll do the online courses tomorrow and stuff
[25506.57s -> 25509.93s]  the last movie night stream was seven hours or so this one shouldn't be that yeah especially
[25509.93s -> 25521.40s]  there's going to be like 60 less videos than the first one but that's where i'm going to
[25521.40s -> 25528.26s]  wrap it up but time tomorrow we're going to start at three to four something between three
[25528.26s -> 25537.34s]  and four p.m get three coins to be funny i'll do it some other day yeah the last movie night
[25537.34s -> 25544.33s]  had hundreds of videos this is going to be probably less than a hundred so maybe uh i'll
[25544.33s -> 25554.34s]  probably i don't know we'll we'll gauge the room but that's happening tomorrow i want to
[25554.34s -> 25558.66s]  link the form one more time if somebody didn't get it because obviously this is the last
[25558.66s -> 25573.21s]  chance you're going to get me shouting this out grab the link i might as well turn this on too
[25573.93s -> 25585.30s]  uh if you leave i'll see you tomorrow same time starting somewhere around three to four p.m
[25585.30s -> 25596.44s]  pacific potentially earlier it depends on when i uh get up and get going but plan for the
[25596.44s -> 25606.58s]  normal time anywho if you've taken off hopefully we see you tomorrow if not maybe
[25606.58s -> 25620.18s]  we'll see you again soon let me just go let me grab the grab this here is the submission form
[25620.18s -> 25634.22s]  only submit once not more than once have it be less than three minutes and again this is not
[25634.22s -> 25643.54s]  a contest so not all submissions don't if your submission doesn't get picked it's not like it
[25643.54s -> 25648.98s]  wasn't any good we're just trying to condense them down into ones that are not so similar
[25648.98s -> 25654.26s]  and some of that are maybe a little bit higher quality and don't see the same kind of thing over
[25654.26s -> 25660.95s]  and over again right it's not a contest and after this is all done and i'm going to probably see
[25660.95s -> 25666.07s]  if we can do just another big playlist and not stream it but have a second encore playlist
[25666.71s -> 25672.47s]  with most of the submissions or at least some of the ones that were um that we could show
[25672.47s -> 25677.48s]  afterwards you know but uh i'm gonna just go p i'll be right back we'll do the bits
[25678.28s -> 25682.34s]  and i will be right back see you sure
[25770.90s -> 25797.32s]  just walking back up i feel like a bad migraine right now where the hell will this come from
[25801.10s -> 25810.50s]  strange being old probably well we don't have very there's not a whole lot of bits tonight
[25810.50s -> 25818.90s]  so we should be able to get through this pretty quickly mario migraine now i probably
[25818.90s -> 25823.48s]  just need to eat something anyways uh thank you to lazy luke for the 250

[26377.32s -> 26380.12s]  it's been a while and i enjoyed it and i think you should watch it

[26410.14s -> 26417.64s]  has to be because i'll wake up and then fall back asleep for four hours or so and that's
