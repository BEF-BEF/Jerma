[1.98s -> 6.38s]  What's up? Oh, I thought I was ready to talk wasn't apparently apparently wasn't ready to talk
[6.38s -> 19.22s]  I best I guess not and I have to say let me let me re situate myself here. Let me put my seat down
[20.31s -> 23.03s]  Uh, let me put my seat up. Actually. I don't like that move this
[23.67s -> 26.17s]  I see it here. There we go. That's better
[26.65s -> 28.25s]  Uh, so I have to say
[28.25s -> 30.55s]  This is the first time for everything
[30.55s -> 32.55s]  And for the first time ever
[33.82s -> 35.21s]  ever
[35.21s -> 40.01s]  Since I started streaming regularly, I that's the hardest word to say in the english language, by the way
[40.95s -> 44.86s]  Regularly since I started streaming regularly
[45.56s -> 49.78s]  This is the first time i've ever streamed
[50.58s -> 51.94s]  on the first
[51.94s -> 55.46s]  Of multiple days that I tell you a stream could happen
[56.10s -> 59.24s]  Think about that. That's it. This is a huge milestone for us
[61.67s -> 66.07s]  Let's say I stream on sunday and I go. Oh, hey guys, you know what the next stream?
[67.27s -> 72.31s]  Maybe tuesday or tuesday or wednesday. I bet it's probably tuesday, but maybe wednesday tuesday or wednesday
[73.03s -> 75.03s]  It's never happened on the tuesday
[75.67s -> 78.23s]  It's always the last day of the range that I give you
[79.32s -> 86.02s]  And now for the first time ever it's it's the first one. It's the it's the first one and i'm early
[88.82s -> 93.78s]  No, i'm actually like 40 minutes over what I told you I was thinking about but look
[94.26s -> 97.62s]  You all know that what you do you thought the stream is gonna happen tomorrow
[98.57s -> 103.37s]  So like holy shit, he's streaming today. Oh nice first time ever. Oh, he's an hour late, but he does that shit every day
[103.37s -> 105.37s]  Anyways, right that you already know that
[107.16s -> 110.52s]  Hold on give me one second. I want to rearrange my desk and I don't want it to be loud
[135.35s -> 137.35s]  Show us the boy show us the boy
[137.43s -> 139.45s]  Yo, I will
[139.45s -> 142.81s]  I promise there will be at least one auto appearance before the stream ends
[143.45s -> 148.10s]  Not right now though. He's sleeping over here. He just came in and he's resting
[150.09s -> 156.17s]  He's buried his head. Whoa, that was gonna be a huge burp if I didn't have extreme skill to suppress that
[159.19s -> 162.95s]  He's on he buried his head under the covers and he's sleeping i'm not gonna wake him up for content
[163.03s -> 165.03s]  He can stay asleep when he's ready
[166.17s -> 168.17s]  And he's ready to view
[170.54s -> 174.25s]  We'll see him
[174.25s -> 177.05s]  Stop burping and talk look how many times you burp a day
[180.82s -> 183.86s]  You burp probably like six or seven hundred times a day
[186.81s -> 189.13s]  It's I think it's a little less than that. Still. It's like it's a lot
[195.93s -> 198.49s]  It's like probably like at least 50 or like 30
[202.12s -> 203.56s]  You okay?
[203.56s -> 205.56s]  You never burp. Yeah, right
[206.50s -> 208.50s]  You're the same person that says
[209.06s -> 214.74s]  Yeah, I I mean I i've fart sometimes but like not really like sometimes if I have like a big meal or
[215.14s -> 220.50s]  No, you're the you're the guy that like goes and hides downstairs turns the bathroom fan on turns the sink on
[221.38s -> 227.08s]  and farts
[227.08s -> 229.32s]  So I I got you. I know who you are
[236.04s -> 242.54s]  You're a hider or you're like you you're the other kind of person though. Correct me if i'm wrong here
[243.48s -> 245.48s]  Or you will go pretend to have a cigarette
[245.96s -> 247.56s]  to make sure
[247.56s -> 249.56s]  That like you don't have to fart around people
[249.72s -> 254.79s]  Yeah, i'll be right back. Just gonna go have a smoke real quick. I didn't know you were a smoker. Yes
[255.59s -> 258.79s]  Shitty fucking habit. Whatever and you go out there and just rip ass outside
[261.67s -> 264.07s]  And then you come back and you you don't want people to know that you're doing that
[264.63s -> 267.00s]  You'd rather have people think you were smoking cigarettes
[267.83s -> 269.83s]  And like fart in their presence
[269.99s -> 274.58s]  Because that's me like that. I'm describing me
[276.76s -> 280.52s]  If we were in a big like area big crowded place and I had nowhere to go
[281.94s -> 284.90s]  And I had to like I had to rip ass really really badly
[285.54s -> 291.30s]  I would rather pretend that the group of people know I smoked cigarettes than like fart in their presence
[291.94s -> 299.59s]  And I know there's a lot of you like me
[299.59s -> 302.82s]  Or go take like a phone call
[302.82s -> 305.70s]  All right, fuck. I I I lean my head over and go
[311.29s -> 313.29s]  I got a call. I think it's my mother
[316.31s -> 324.63s]  I'll walk outside. I haven't all right enough stalling. Let's go
[325.19s -> 327.83s]  We're going to continue. Mr. Satan's wrestling empire
[328.55s -> 334.76s]  If you didn't catch the stream yesterday
[337.21s -> 340.25s]  Off to a great start during my nice. I'd like to hear that
[343.19s -> 345.83s]  If you didn't get straight yesterday wrestling empire, it's fucking one of the best games
[345.83s -> 348.63s]  I played in the last couple of years. I guarantee that's not a joke
[350.09s -> 352.09s]  I do want to make something really clear
[355.16s -> 358.82s]  You know time it is you have any idea what time it is?
[368.82s -> 369.78s]  it's
[369.78s -> 371.06s]  This time
[371.06s -> 377.19s]  Because here's the game
[377.19s -> 389.29s]  Mr satan continues what how much money do I make three dollars a week? That's what I wanted
[389.29s -> 391.93s]  That's what I wanted it to start and I fucked it all up
[392.89s -> 396.33s]  I thought that was the beginning of the song but it was the end of the song
[397.77s -> 400.01s]  Whatever
[400.01s -> 403.05s]  You get the idea
[403.05s -> 405.53s]  And you know the more like I hit the more that I listen to this song
[406.17s -> 409.59s]  So i've heard it like 60 or 70 times in the last 24 hours
[410.82s -> 412.82s]  I like the song. This is a good song
[413.54s -> 417.91s]  I want to put this on like a playlist now. This song is fucking pretty. This is an awesome song
[422.73s -> 424.31s]  All right, let's go
[424.31s -> 426.71s]  Uh, I had nothing scheduled today so we can
[427.67s -> 431.19s]  What do I need to do am I under any contractual obligations to do anything
[441.27s -> 442.76s]  No, right
[442.76s -> 445.40s]  No contract bullshit that I have to do by a certain date
[446.04s -> 450.97s]  My agility sucks. Should I do agility?
[451.29s -> 457.43s]  Look in the top right
[457.43s -> 459.43s]  Oh, no. Okay. Good. Good. Good. That's good to know
[460.15s -> 467.34s]  I'm gonna do agility because I feel like it's gonna be like get your agility to 80 more strength. Um, yeah
[468.22s -> 472.57s]  I lost skill. I lost skill. That's bad
[473.21s -> 477.16s]  I got a day off. It's fine. All right
[477.48s -> 484.54s]  Today's the day of rest
[484.54s -> 489.42s]  No creative control is bad. I know I completely fucked over everything but whatever I look I could just
[489.98s -> 492.06s]  I can just beat the boss up until I get to leave
[492.86s -> 496.79s]  You don't keep mr. Satan under a contract if he doesn't want to be on it. All right
[497.51s -> 500.58s]  I thought that was the joker
[500.58s -> 503.34s]  So I think that's supposed to be donk the clown
[503.42s -> 510.95s]  Okay
[510.95s -> 513.83s]  In nine weeks, you might be able to renegotiate. All right, let's we'll do that then
[514.39s -> 519.50s]  Also, by the way, if you didn't see yesterday's stream
[520.90s -> 525.78s]  You're in for a real fucking treat because this is seriously i'm not i'm almost swearing for no reason, right?
[525.86s -> 527.86s]  There was no reason me to say the f-word there
[528.58s -> 533.54s]  Like I just deliberately put the f-word in there. I don't know why like I was like, oh, yeah, it's gonna sound cool
[533.62s -> 535.38s]  No, i'm not gonna do that anymore
[535.38s -> 540.50s]  Okay. I think this is the charity
[540.98s -> 541.94s]  event
[541.94s -> 543.67s]  right
[543.67s -> 548.55s]  This is for charity for something. What was that?
[550.86s -> 552.86s]  He just like hit his head on the sign
[553.02s -> 560.07s]  What's that sound?
[560.07s -> 562.07s]  vulture with thomas son
[566.09s -> 568.17s]  and mr. Satan
[568.17s -> 570.17s]  with motorola champ
[572.04s -> 574.04s]  I can't walk. There we go
[586.70s -> 588.54s]  Is this for what's this for?
[588.54s -> 590.73s]  And this is my oh
[590.73s -> 594.28s]  Did you come up with a weight?
[594.28s -> 597.24s]  Ultra die out here much more than just another wrestler left
[601.70s -> 602.90s]  Ow
[602.90s -> 608.98s]  This is a special charity event that would raise money for good causes around the world were they mad that I was turned around
[609.98s -> 616.92s]  Those attendants have already donated bit by bit showing up. So give yourselves a big round of applause. Get away from me put that down
[618.41s -> 622.09s]  And we hope you'll be joined by many more watching at home who can also pledge their donation
[622.41s -> 625.24s]  Is this a hardcore match?
[625.24s -> 630.52s]  Enough talking vulture. Let's give the world what they want. Let me guess a big match for a big donation
[635.75s -> 637.75s]  Wait, why does the ref have a bomb?
[652.98s -> 658.02s]  All right, let's go
[658.02s -> 660.02s]  The map why is it on fire?
[661.64s -> 663.80s]  Holy shit. Oh, I got him with it. I got him. I got him
[664.44s -> 669.75s]  So this is just a singles match for charity. All right. Well that was
[671.69s -> 675.05s]  I'm fine. All right. How much help do I have? All right, let's kick this guy's ass
[678.39s -> 680.47s]  It's funny every time i'm sorry
[680.47s -> 683.19s]  It's one of those games where it's funny every fucking time
[683.99s -> 699.53s]  Can I just count them out? All right, let's do some wrestling
[702.78s -> 705.82s]  Why did the ref have a bomb? I don't I don't that's the part. I don't understand
[710.07s -> 712.07s]  Did he throw that into the audience?
[714.06s -> 717.34s]  I love how unhinged the referees are as well as the players. All right
[717.82s -> 719.82s]  typically you want your referee to be somebody that's
[720.30s -> 722.14s]  collected calm
[722.14s -> 724.62s]  Tries to get order holds the court. Whatever
[725.50s -> 727.50s]  This guy is just as fucked up as everybody else
[743.88s -> 748.84s]  Where is he going?
[748.84s -> 757.03s]  He's not paying attention. I got him. Oh, it's it's
[761.03s -> 765.35s]  That's another thing these guys do they just get on the top rope the people that aren't even supposed to be in here
[766.39s -> 769.40s]  Like get the fuck out of here
[770.28s -> 772.28s]  You fucking little worm
[782.20s -> 793.24s]  All right, i'm gonna drop this guy in his head big ddt grab him by his jowls and shake him
[798.86s -> 801.58s]  All right, it's time let's go this is it that's a special move
[804.90s -> 806.46s]  It's over
[806.46s -> 812.92s]  I hear those crunches
[813.00s -> 817.05s]  Got out
[817.05s -> 820.01s]  That's the match is not over yet. Get out get out here. I didn't win yet
[820.33s -> 822.73s]  I know we both thought it was a guarantee, but it didn't happen
[827.13s -> 831.82s]  That's it something broke over on stage left. I don't know what it was
[837.86s -> 839.86s]  What broke did you hear that?
[843.77s -> 846.76s]  Who's this?
[846.76s -> 852.06s]  Wait, who's that lady?
[852.06s -> 854.06s]  You see this person out here. Who's this person?
[858.62s -> 860.82s]  I'm so confused
[860.82s -> 871.59s]  Yeah, what ellie knots? What are you doing? Who is this? He couldn't even get out of the ring
[872.39s -> 902.78s]  Is a commentator I thought this was a fan. Oh my god, i'm gonna get counted out. It is a fan. Oh no, it's not oops
[903.74s -> 915.94s]  All right, big move to end it. Here we go. That's not what I wanted, but it's okay. That's a pin got it one
[916.74s -> 927.22s]  Two this guy is
[930.62s -> 933.74s]  Stop booing
[933.74s -> 938.30s]  God damn it. This is budget sting. I think
[939.37s -> 944.22s]  There's a lot of licensed kind of characters that are in the game in quotes
[946.20s -> 950.18s]  All right, I didn't want it. Where's my manager and how come he's not helping me?
[952.10s -> 956.97s]  They've renamed and sort of changed slightly a lot of people that look like characters
[957.70s -> 961.62s]  So we just saw doink the clown. I'm that's supposed to be doink the clown
[970.86s -> 979.94s]  Get out. Jesus. This guy's resilient
[981.77s -> 991.14s]  Get out free. There it is. All right
[991.86s -> 995.99s]  This guy refuses to die. Yeah, wait, here comes ellie knots
[996.63s -> 1000.57s]  What do you want? What do you want? Why are you looking at me? Get away from me?
[1002.39s -> 1014.79s]  That was weird. Somebody said are you gonna kill any more friends today?
[1015.86s -> 1023.58s]  I did not kill schmo. Okay, the last match that me and schmo had I did
[1024.47s -> 1029.53s]  Beat him over and over again in the head with a bat and like a a garbage can lid
[1030.09s -> 1032.09s]  And he died two days later
[1032.09s -> 1034.17s]  But it said he died of natural
[1034.89s -> 1038.89s]  Causes it didn't say he suffered any injuries. That's not my I didn't do that
[1039.53s -> 1048.04s]  It said natural causes
[1050.55s -> 1051.91s]  a natural
[1051.91s -> 1053.91s]  bat to the head
[1057.93s -> 1063.45s]  The bat the bat was made out of wood. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Hold on. So you had fun out there. Mr
[1063.45s -> 1071.30s]  Satan well, you made quite a mess of the arena if you ever want to book this venue again
[1071.30s -> 1073.62s]  You better pay two hundred dollars towards the damages
[1076.73s -> 1079.50s]  What damages?
[1079.50s -> 1085.06s]  Oh because I threw the bomb but the ref had it in his hand. I just took it from him and threw
[1088.20s -> 1090.20s]  And look, here's the thing. I
[1090.20s -> 1092.20s]  Listen, this is this is where you get weird
[1092.92s -> 1099.30s]  Legally speaking, right? So who's real whose whose fault was it referee brings bomb into the ring?
[1099.94s -> 1106.39s]  I grab bomb throw bomb guy picks bomb up on ground bomb blows up in his hand
[1106.47s -> 1113.78s]  So what happened like the referee didn't detonate it. I didn't that he picked it up and blew up in his hand
[1114.42s -> 1116.42s]  That's not my fault
[1116.42s -> 1120.02s]  Like that's like collectively we should all have to split the bill in my opinion
[1122.36s -> 1125.08s]  At least me and the ref the ref should the ref brought it in the ring
[1125.16s -> 1127.16s]  I'm just trying to fucking get rid of the damn thing
[1131.02s -> 1135.26s]  Referee brought it into the ring and he's just holding it. I took it out of his hand and I fucking whipped it
[1135.26s -> 1137.51s]  I was like get this out of here
[1137.51s -> 1140.23s]  And then he picked it up because he wanted to use it and it blew up
[1143.64s -> 1146.84s]  That's I I I accept 45 percent of the bill there. Not all of it
[1149.26s -> 1152.54s]  I think the referee made out really really well and who brought it by the way
[1153.34s -> 1160.44s]  Anyone that can beat vulture deserves to be at hollywood as well
[1162.39s -> 1169.30s]  Wait one we feel you'd be a valuable addition to the cast and we'd like to make you a star with this deal
[1174.28s -> 1179.32s]  Oh shit, this is way better than my contract now. This is the guy next to me. That's the owner
[1180.90s -> 1183.06s]  Okay, when I sign the contract throw him out the window
[1185.93s -> 1189.78s]  You know what I mean? Like let's go i'll sign this right now
[1192.09s -> 1200.07s]  Only paid for winning matches. That's fine. I win every match. This is this is a good contract
[1204.34s -> 1208.26s]  I want longer
[1208.26s -> 1211.54s]  I want at least 12 weeks
[1211.54s -> 1213.70s]  But that's 3400 a week. This guy's paying me
[1214.40s -> 1216.10s]  300 a week
[1216.10s -> 1219.30s]  And I I have no control over anything that I ever do
[1219.86s -> 1223.00s]  But do you think right now he's side-eyeing me?
[1223.00s -> 1227.67s]  It's like almost like i'm kind of I want to give him like a telepathic text
[1228.23s -> 1230.63s]  With my eyes saying like mother fucker
[1231.19s -> 1236.41s]  I want five grand a week when we go in the car and I decide if i'm gonna do this or not
[1239.46s -> 1241.46s]  I'll do 12 weeks. Let's go. Yeah, fuck this guy
[1244.39s -> 1248.07s]  Movie shoots don't tend to last that long. We prefer to keep this short
[1249.78s -> 1252.54s]  Oh
[1253.50s -> 1256.95s]  Damn it
[1256.95s -> 1265.99s]  All right. All right. All right. I'll do six weeks. Okay. All right
[1265.99s -> 1270.65s]  All right
[1270.65s -> 1274.49s]  We'll book you against vulture straight away to reignite you a few ways. This must be scripted
[1274.73s -> 1283.78s]  Listen mr. Satan a lot has changed since we first signed you to 3400 a week 30 seconds ago
[1285.11s -> 1290.76s]  A lot has changed. We all have to make sacrifices to stay afloat. So how would you feel about taking a pay cut?
[1291.86s -> 1298.57s]  Excuse me. I just we haven't even left the office yet
[1299.37s -> 1302.65s]  We have not i haven't even gone to the bathroom since I signed that contract
[1304.01s -> 1307.53s]  No, you know, excuse me pay me what we agreed. Fuck that
[1310.74s -> 1312.92s]  What?
[1312.92s -> 1316.12s]  If you insist on being a financial drain i'm gonna have to cut you off
[1320.14s -> 1322.78s]  Did I get fired what am I in?
[1323.74s -> 1325.74s]  I'm in wrestling school
[1330.49s -> 1335.34s]  What just happened?
[1335.34s -> 1338.06s]  Like I I what happened what?
[1343.54s -> 1348.98s]  You can't do that
[1349.06s -> 1351.06s]  Now i'm back in wrestling school
[1358.86s -> 1361.70s]  um
[1361.70s -> 1364.82s]  Okay. Now I know who my biggest enemies in the world are
[1367.06s -> 1371.83s]  I was part of that. Um, what was I didn't know what the name of my card was before
[1372.79s -> 1381.40s]  They treated me like shit they paid me nothing but that guy at least fought for me. No, don't touch the bomb. That's bait
[1382.20s -> 1384.20s]  Because they know that i'm gonna pay for everything
[1384.28s -> 1386.12s]  After I was just talking shit about it
[1386.12s -> 1391.46s]  Mr. Satan, shouldn't you be shooting a movie instead of doing something as lowly as wrestling?
[1391.70s -> 1396.26s]  Yeah, I would if I didn't um get like the rug pulled underneath me after I signed a contract
[1396.82s -> 1404.66s]  Stick to that nonsense because you don't belong in the ring with me. You know, that stings evidently
[1404.66s -> 1408.26s]  I'm a little out of touch. You're so far under my radar. You know who the hell you are
[1408.82s -> 1410.92s]  I'm like so sad. I can't even do the mr
[1410.92s -> 1426.87s]  Satan voice i'll make you famous tonight and you'll realize there is such a thing as bad publicity. Is he counting himself out?
[1432.81s -> 1436.49s]  I can't fucking believe that just happened. Did I even get any incentive payment for joining?
[1437.54s -> 1443.75s]  No, it was I left my organization joined a new one and they fired me within the first 10 seconds signing the contract
[1444.23s -> 1448.15s]  That's so sad
[1448.15s -> 1456.22s]  Because you didn't ask for an advance
[1456.30s -> 1458.73s]  Well, I didn't think I was gonna have to ask for an advance
[1462.95s -> 1466.39s]  Your contract died of natural causes that's a good one
[1467.03s -> 1471.59s]  That's actually good. That was a really good joke. I'm serious. That's perfect. I wish I said that
[1474.86s -> 1486.86s]  Okay, I keep hurting myself when I do these moves
[1492.84s -> 1494.84s]  Hey
[1494.92s -> 1510.57s]  It should we go off our injury on this guy take the green contract not the red one
[1514.33s -> 1516.33s]  All right. Let's put this guy out
[1516.90s -> 1527.14s]  Good night. See you later
[1528.78s -> 1530.78s]  How come there's no music?
[1531.34s -> 1533.34s]  You know, I was thinking about this last night
[1534.04s -> 1537.96s]  And it sort of almost adds to how funny the game is in a way
[1538.28s -> 1544.20s]  Because it's just he's just and it's also because i've been in wrestling school as a contract so there's no audience members
[1545.48s -> 1551.16s]  Every time I get signed within like a week something horrible happens and I lose my contract so there's no crowd noise
[1551.96s -> 1555.51s]  That's what you're missing right now
[1555.51s -> 1557.51s]  You're missing the like, whoa
[1560.79s -> 1563.99s]  But it actually kind of adds to like how awkward this is
[1564.79s -> 1576.25s]  Remember you're killing people. I've not killed anybody
[1582.30s -> 1587.02s]  Name me one person i've killed that I killed like in the ring. You know what I mean? It's nobody
[1591.11s -> 1605.06s]  Okay, that sounded bad, but I assure you he's fine. All right, give me a new contract
[1614.60s -> 1617.26s]  Mr. Satan has reached the limit of wrestling school's popularity
[1619.03s -> 1620.39s]  Yeah, I
[1620.39s -> 1622.55s]  What the I can't what am I supposed to do about this?
[1623.35s -> 1632.78s]  Can I get a contract? That's not a piece of shit
[1633.58s -> 1637.29s]  Smoke was a lawyer. He could have helped you
[1638.82s -> 1640.82s]  Smoke, okay. Those are you guys saying?
[1641.06s -> 1646.34s]  Oh, no, what did I do to smoke? Do you remember the the absolute double cross that smoke did to me?
[1647.22s -> 1650.94s]  Where he threw the match and like hugged the opposition after I lost
[1656.90s -> 1659.30s]  Ronald wiener feels great today and is in perfect health
[1659.94s -> 1664.94s]  Mr. Satan won 82 percent of his 17 matches
[1665.66s -> 1669.93s]  hardcore tag team versus blonde blunders team
[1676.39s -> 1679.21s]  I
[1679.21s -> 1681.21s]  I need to get uh, so
[1681.45s -> 1682.81s]  All right, let's go
[1682.89s -> 1690.50s]  Hardcore match, you know what that means. Let's do it. What's this guy? Remember this guy from the first career?
[1692.90s -> 1696.02s]  I am at let's say this is a hardcore match. All right, i'm going for this guy
[1696.90s -> 1703.30s]  Who's my partner?
[1703.30s -> 1705.99s]  Mr satan and vendetta
[1706.07s -> 1730.30s]  All right vendetta walk intimidatingly to the ring. Oh, we're already going
[1734.79s -> 1736.98s]  vegeta
[1736.98s -> 1744.96s]  Yeah, it is vegeta vegeta. Mr satan and vegeta
[1749.30s -> 1763.13s]  Oh my god
[1763.13s -> 1765.13s]  You don't challenge me to a hardcore match it
[1768.25s -> 1771.24s]  Okay
[1771.24s -> 1773.56s]  I want the I want to buy where's where's vegeta?
[1778.39s -> 1780.09s]  Where's vegeta?
[1780.09s -> 1783.21s]  Where's vegeta get out here vegeta. I need help
[1787.14s -> 1789.14s]  No, I don't want to take the desk
[1789.46s -> 1795.22s]  Can I borrow this?
[1795.22s -> 1800.50s]  it's a legal
[1800.50s -> 1821.78s]  Murder
[1821.78s -> 1829.28s]  All right, pit him. Let's get him vegeta. Hold on vegeta. I got an idea
[1838.33s -> 1853.22s]  Oh
[1857.10s -> 1863.99s]  Can we pin him I can't pin him out here why can't I pin him
[1865.19s -> 1874.38s]  This guy's not supposed to be in the ring. I think this guy's I just have to go to super saiyan for a minute there vegeta
[1880.44s -> 1887.02s]  No, no, that's like part of the uh, right when we like vegeta upstages me and we have a rivalry
[1888.55s -> 1889.35s]  and
[1889.35s -> 1893.11s]  Right. It's like we're both strong and there has to be a big rivalry between us
[1893.75s -> 1899.77s]  And then we fight a few times
[1899.77s -> 1902.73s]  Okay, um, all right vegeta come in here let me see pass that to me
[1905.16s -> 1907.99s]  Ask me that
[1907.99s -> 1911.75s]  Let me see that thing. I'm gonna use it on him. What did that guy do that for?
[1912.76s -> 1917.96s]  Why did he do that? That guy was just showing off at like a trampoline park. That wasn't even him trying to fight anybody
[1943.16s -> 1946.36s]  It's like this is murder. This is actual murder but like
[1947.16s -> 1949.96s]  What happened? What happened to him? He like hurt his back. What happened?
[1958.18s -> 1960.34s]  Okay, all right, okay, so we won
[1960.98s -> 1962.98s]  We didn't that's the win
[1964.02s -> 1966.78s]  Did we win
[1981.35s -> 1989.13s]  What's wrong
[1989.13s -> 1993.29s]  Okay into the ring
[1993.29s -> 1999.30s]  I'm fine
[1999.30s -> 2001.78s]  Why get up? What's wrong with me? Why can't I get up?
[2002.90s -> 2005.38s]  Um, he won't he's not coming back in the ring and I can't pin him out there
[2005.78s -> 2012.76s]  What am I supposed to do about this culture? I don't know what to do
[2018.31s -> 2037.11s]  Oh my god, this is horrible. Um, how do I get him back in the ring? Yeah. All right
[2037.19s -> 2046.31s]  Come here in the ring in the ring. How do I throw him in the ring? There we go. All right
[2047.40s -> 2052.22s]  Okay, just by the way, this is revenge from this is revenge from the my career
[2054.90s -> 2060.42s]  Okay, dude, you all saw that he he could have just easily had taken that fall right there and been fine. Just stay down
[2062.79s -> 2064.52s]  You're kidding me
[2064.52s -> 2067.48s]  Really? Do you see what the shape your friend is in right now?
[2068.20s -> 2070.76s]  I almost want to let this guy pin me because this is awful
[2078.39s -> 2092.97s]  Pick him up and just end it. All right, vegeta go for it. That's it
[2093.85s -> 2095.85s]  Yeah, all right. Let's this is let's go
[2096.57s -> 2108.57s]  Vegeta is upset that he was barely involved in that match
[2109.69s -> 2116.17s]  Mr satan has reached the limit of wrestling school's popularity. Yeah, I know
[2117.19s -> 2121.99s]  Blonde blunder severely injured his leg in that match and will be unable to wrestle for the next four weeks
[2123.02s -> 2128.54s]  Even then he may be a shadow of his former self. Oh boy
[2133.96s -> 2136.12s]  All order is upset that he was barely involved
[2151.43s -> 2154.95s]  Vegeta has turned face and will now be portrayed in a positive light
[2158.06s -> 2161.82s]  The year is now 2022 and mr satan has turned 26 years old
[2163.70s -> 2165.70s]  I have an 83 win rate
[2170.47s -> 2172.63s]  All right, give me give me some new shit
[2174.50s -> 2176.50s]  I'm I have to get out of the wrestling school
[2178.81s -> 2182.81s]  How many times do I have to embarrass this guy in a singles match before somebody signs me and I can go fight somebody?
[2187.11s -> 2189.03s]  Oh my god, that was funny
[2189.03s -> 2196.31s]  This guy's bringing a camera
[2196.31s -> 2204.82s]  This guy was this guy's bringing a camera to
[2205.06s -> 2209.30s]  I think you can use the roster to approach a company boss for a contract. I might have to try that
[2214.78s -> 2216.78s]  Wait benz is back with a uh
[2217.61s -> 2221.69s]  He's got a little he's got all right. Okay, you want to play? He's got a pep in his step now
[2222.41s -> 2242.78s]  He's been training. All right, fine. Okay, the way I was just running around right there
[2244.09s -> 2246.81s]  I had so much intent there. That was like a resident evil
[2247.29s -> 2250.94s]  Two speed run
[2251.26s -> 2253.26s]  Turn turn turn turn turn turn
[2259.91s -> 2265.90s]  I wouldn't stop if items. I was just I just had one goal in mind. All right, come on. Let's go
[2265.98s -> 2268.06s]  Oh, let's wrestle. I want to promise my hitch for the chair again
[2277.66s -> 2285.45s]  and
[2285.45s -> 2301.69s]  Duplex benz is coming to avenge blonde blunder watch me break his leg too. Holy shit. That was awesome. Do it again
[2306.55s -> 2308.07s]  Not that way
[2308.07s -> 2332.60s]  That was miscalculated by just a small amount. I think big roll up. Let's l and r at the singles menu
[2332.92s -> 2336.31s]  It'll change what you do
[2336.39s -> 2341.11s]  Yeah, I can simulate events right? I can skip events. I like playing though. This game's really fun
[2346.42s -> 2348.66s]  Like all right, so m dicky made this game, right?
[2351.80s -> 2353.40s]  like can we
[2353.40s -> 2356.76s]  I say this frequently. Yeah, maybe not that frequently but still
[2358.17s -> 2360.81s]  Can like can can like a venture capitalist?
[2361.77s -> 2365.05s]  Just get to give m dicky like fucking 60 million dollars
[2366.15s -> 2371.53s]  You know what I mean? And have him make like a have him get like a a team of people and
[2371.85s -> 2373.21s]  I don't know how many people worked on this game
[2373.21s -> 2377.37s]  But like this is awesome like imagine if m dicky had like fucking 40 million dollars
[2378.01s -> 2380.89s]  50 million dollars
[2380.89s -> 2383.29s]  I want that game. I want to see what that game is
[2384.49s -> 2400.44s]  Like why can't m dicky just get like 50 fucking million dollars to make a wrestling game? He probably doesn't want to yeah
[2400.52s -> 2403.72s]  I know and i'm bad. That's me saying. This is like oh imagine
[2405.21s -> 2407.53s]  The charm of having this be the way that it is sure
[2408.82s -> 2412.10s]  Well, I hope I really hope this makes him a decent amount of money
[2412.18s -> 2416.42s]  And I really hope that he did like does well people like it because like this shit needs to be supported
[2416.66s -> 2426.14s]  It really does. All right, let's end it
[2428.87s -> 2433.22s]  Get over here. Should I change my finishing move or is this sufficient?
[2443.00s -> 2446.20s]  He's been really good at supporting this game on the switch since it came out in january
[2451.83s -> 2454.07s]  There it is. Oh wait, that was a scream
[2454.71s -> 2459.56s]  Don't forget the chair that you hit me with to win the match
[2464.49s -> 2479.11s]  his face
[2479.11s -> 2484.86s]  Did I injure him? No, okay. He's fine. He's fine
[2491.51s -> 2494.07s]  But yeah, this is the kind of stuff that I love to play
[2500.15s -> 2505.91s]  Like I wish like more independent devs could just just be just total creative control and just get like a decent amount of money
[2505.91s -> 2510.95s]  To do whatever they want. We've taken each other to hell and back. Mr. Satan
[2511.03s -> 2516.66s]  I've had I've had enough of it
[2516.66s -> 2520.74s]  Why don't we bury the hatchet so that we can both get back to concentrating on our careers?
[2520.82s -> 2529.51s]  I don't know who this is. Is it bad that like i've beaten so many people
[2530.39s -> 2535.45s]  Like nearly to death in this wrestling arena that I they're all blended together. I don't know who that is
[2537.05s -> 2542.70s]  All right. Sure. Let's make peace. Why not? Maybe we'll end up working together sometime
[2542.78s -> 2544.78s]  I'm certainly had enough of working against you
[2545.34s -> 2551.93s]  All right, somebody said go to database
[2554.94s -> 2562.76s]  I it's a handicap match versus score of bends and canado
[2572.35s -> 2577.47s]  No one with money trusts creative people to make creative decisions that will turn them a profit rich people only care about getting richer
[2577.79s -> 2581.95s]  Well, that's why I meant like a venture capitalist just somebody or like an angel investor or something
[2587.92s -> 2600.91s]  They keep putting a bomb here. What are the rules?
[2601.71s -> 2603.71s]  What are the what's going on here? What are the rules?
[2611.96s -> 2613.00s]  Oh shit
[2613.00s -> 2617.15s]  Nope, but can they both be in the ring at the same time?
[2617.79s -> 2629.76s]  Oh, this should be easy then I just kicked this I just kicked his ass like an hour ago
[2630.08s -> 2650.67s]  Go go get a weapon reverse it got it now. Let's go for a snap
[2651.07s -> 2653.85s]  Oops
[2653.85s -> 2662.20s]  And look, there's also there's also the argument that could be made that like if this was changed, right?
[2662.36s -> 2668.84s]  like let's say that somebody like this got a team of like 20 people to like deliberate stuff to and
[2669.32s -> 2674.60s]  That he ended up being the lead and would it be the same game? Like would it be the actual same experience? I don't know
[2675.24s -> 2688.16s]  That's the multi versus four
[2690.08s -> 2703.64s]  Oh, come on quick head smash
[2704.60s -> 2716.32s]  Wallace victory incoming. Oh my god. I'm unbeatable. I'm gonna get out of wrestling school. I'm fighting like fucking jobbers
[2719.56s -> 2723.96s]  Like these are the guys that that wrestled 25 like no I have to get out of here
[2723.96s -> 2726.60s]  I'm like I need this is way above below me
[2727.80s -> 2729.80s]  These people are just training. They're just rookies
[2730.52s -> 2736.36s]  You wonder why i'm hurting everybody's because i'm not supposed to be here. I'm fucking injuring a bunch of
[2737.14s -> 2746.83s]  rookies
[2746.83s -> 2760.91s]  Oh, i'm going in from out here
[2761.47s -> 2764.02s]  This is like a phd going back to kindergarten
[2768.38s -> 2770.38s]  That would hurt so bad
[2772.49s -> 2776.25s]  But get it. I'm gonna get out of here. I need to go to the roster and like and approach somebody
[2805.05s -> 2807.96s]  And perfect perfect perfect go go go go
[2810.81s -> 2813.00s]  Oh, come on
[2813.00s -> 2814.52s]  Give them a chance
[2814.52s -> 2825.10s]  I just I shouldn't even be here. I'm unstoppable even on 2v1. Oh my god
[2825.90s -> 2843.77s]  They're trying like they're trying to get away from me. This is the shitty filler episode
[2844.25s -> 2846.06s]  Well, that's what I mean like, okay
[2846.06s -> 2850.54s]  Like hulk hogan used to come out and he would he would fight like like an hour before wrestlemania
[2851.02s -> 2853.50s]  it'd be like it'd be like hulk hogan versus
[2854.46s -> 2858.94s]  Steve anderson and it'd be like a guy and just a regular guy and it'd be a guy just to warm up hulk hogan
[2859.66s -> 2871.79s]  These are like the warm-up guys like and I shouldn't I really shouldn't be here. I'm gonna hurt him. I think I hope I don't
[2877.00s -> 2883.32s]  Yeah, they're called jobbers. I know that's what i'm saying. Like I feel like this is like i'm just against like the warm-up crew
[2883.96s -> 2887.87s]  Yet they still want to continue to fight
[2901.50s -> 2906.78s]  There's five minutes remaining. They're just taking constant punishment that guy I heard of rib break
[2907.50s -> 2908.94s]  Something broke
[2908.94s -> 2916.30s]  I need a more violent finisher
[2916.38s -> 2930.01s]  Maybe that'll help you're gonna tell you're not gonna test of strike. Mr. Staten. I'm sorry. That's not happening
[2930.57s -> 2941.69s]  I gotta get this guy out of the ring. He's a huge problem. Just get the fuck out of here
[2944.73s -> 2955.18s]  Oh my god, my arm
[2955.18s -> 2959.10s]  Wait, who's pinning who who's pinning who did I just get pinned?
[2960.06s -> 2963.58s]  What happened they sandwiched me they sandwiched me
[2969.36s -> 2971.69s]  What
[2971.69s -> 2975.45s]  I couldn't move. He had me stuffed in a fucking sandwich
[2977.72s -> 2982.89s]  too good
[2982.89s -> 2985.53s]  He used the other guy's lifeless body
[2986.33s -> 2988.97s]  To squish me together and the other guy was holding me back
[2990.46s -> 2992.54s]  I couldn't be my character couldn't even move
[2993.26s -> 2998.00s]  lost to the jobbers
[2998.16s -> 3001.56s]  Oh
[3001.56s -> 3008.92s]  Jeremy you suck just throw all connected internet devices into the ocean. No, I you saw how much I was kicking their ass the whole time
[3014.57s -> 3017.13s]  What the fuck somebody just give me a contract so I can get out of here
[3020.09s -> 3024.03s]  Oh, he's going to maple leaf grappling. We know a guy from there
[3024.75s -> 3032.08s]  Nice to meet you. Mr. Staten. We invited you here to discuss working for strong style wrestling
[3034.36s -> 3041.28s]  All right, you're not exactly a priority for us right now, but we consider bringing you in with this deal. Oh, come on
[3047.84s -> 3049.04s]  That's
[3049.04s -> 3051.20s]  Four weeks. Come on, dude
[3051.20s -> 3054.40s]  All right, you give me a fucking thousand dollars to not waste my goddamn time
[3059.28s -> 3062.48s]  You may have commanded that much in the past, but i'm afraid those days are behind you now
[3063.84s -> 3068.92s]  No, what you're referring to is a contract that I signed and they took away from me in five seconds. What the fuck
[3069.80s -> 3076.08s]  Is it because I just lost those two guys?
[3076.08s -> 3082.81s]  Is it because I just lost to the two jobbers? Is that why you saw that on tv? That's why there's an explanation there
[3082.81s -> 3086.92s]  They sandwiched me I got whatever
[3091.12s -> 3094.00s]  Welcome to strong style wrestling. Let's go
[3094.32s -> 3100.06s]  Of course your friend crucial kennedy is also welcome to join you on the same terms
[3101.36s -> 3108.86s]  I don't care about what crucial kennedy does have you ever heard of a wrestler called maddie mcfly from all american wrestling?
[3109.63s -> 3114.72s]  What's this? Well, I think we could do the gimmick better
[3115.36s -> 3117.44s]  So how would you like to be our version of him?
[3122.46s -> 3124.86s]  Oh wait, they they like changed me
[3129.56s -> 3131.56s]  Should I imitate maddie mcfly?
[3133.15s -> 3135.95s]  What did they do to me? They shaved my mustache
[3143.92s -> 3147.04s]  No, I don't want to imitate anybody i'm mr. Satan god damn it
[3147.52s -> 3152.78s]  Sorry, did it make it sound like you had a choice? We need you to be more like him. So make it happen
[3156.16s -> 3158.16s]  I'll have to be i've missed
[3158.56s -> 3160.40s]  What?
[3160.40s -> 3162.40s]  They changed my outfit
[3182.88s -> 3186.32s]  Hardcore match versus calvin whatever and I that
[3187.04s -> 3189.04s]  I've had to shave my mustache
[3189.20s -> 3195.39s]  And put a new costume on it's just for four weeks. Okay
[3197.36s -> 3199.23s]  all right now
[3199.23s -> 3201.87s]  Wait, is this is this for me to change like my identity or something?
[3203.26s -> 3209.34s]  Because like i'm the guy that killed like three people in the ring. So I shaved my mustache come back with new music
[3209.98s -> 3215.12s]  What is this new music?
[3215.12s -> 3226.89s]  You can't whoa
[3229.26s -> 3236.80s]  I'm not you're a long way from home. Mr. Satan. You should have stayed at wrestling school
[3238.20s -> 3243.00s]  You may have been a big fish in that small pond but strong style wrestling is too tough for a loser like you
[3244.00s -> 3249.28s]  This is my yard. These are my fans. Nobody carves out a successful career here without my blessing
[3251.12s -> 3253.12s]  That's strange because I recall
[3253.52s -> 3257.20s]  I recall signing my contract with russell haystacks and not you
[3257.92s -> 3262.86s]  Russell haystacks can't protect you once you step in this ring. So you better watch your attitude
[3265.79s -> 3267.31s]  And whatever you say
[3267.31s -> 3268.83s]  i'm coming for you
[3268.83s -> 3274.75s]  You want to see how much real animal I can be?
[3275.47s -> 3277.47s]  I don't belong here, huh? Calvin?
[3278.32s -> 3280.32s]  I don't belong here, huh? Calvin?
[3283.64s -> 3285.64s]  You don't think I belong in strong wrestling?
[3289.69s -> 3295.79s]  Oops my head
[3295.79s -> 3301.10s]  Get the fuck out of here. Oh
[3303.39s -> 3311.66s]  Let's go
[3311.66s -> 3313.66s]  You don't belong in here with me
[3314.70s -> 3320.52s]  I belong in here with you
[3354.32s -> 3356.50s]  That's something I have to do it's very important
[3357.14s -> 3380.93s]  I'm sorry
[3389.17s -> 3395.86s]  This is hardcore
[3395.86s -> 3416.35s]  Get that table in here. Let's go. Goodbye and now he's going through a table and i'm gonna end it get away from me
[3416.93s -> 3421.15s]  Midnight's over here trying to fight me. It wasn't even my fault that we fought
[3421.39s -> 3437.25s]  We were over there and I just kind of hit it's not what I wanted to do
[3437.33s -> 3445.66s]  All right, get him on there and we're gonna end it here get on the table
[3446.67s -> 3467.20s]  Uh, goodbye count it. No still in there. All right. Oh fuck. Uh, oh, he's got a mic
[3469.30s -> 3482.03s]  Uh, oh damn it. I missed
[3486.59s -> 3500.08s]  Well, he keeps kicking out
[3500.08s -> 3505.94s]  That's it and i'm game over. I got the respect of Calvin and Hobbes whatever this guy's name was
[3509.10s -> 3510.64s]  engineer gameplay
[3510.64s -> 3521.34s]  That encounter established. Mr. Satan as a face who has the support of the fans. What?
[3531.39s -> 3539.41s]  I got 600 bucks. I'm telling you they don't think i'm the old. Mr. Satan. I shaved my mustache
[3539.97s -> 3552.08s]  Literally being a guy with a crowbar brings the respect of the fans
[3553.68s -> 3558.64s]  Wrestling school have crowned vegeta as their new postgraduate champion nice
[3559.20s -> 3563.62s]  Listen, i'm, not sure the name. Mr. Satan captures the essence of your character
[3564.48s -> 3570.69s]  Oh, no, they're realizing that I have to change. How would you feel about being called something like?
[3571.77s -> 3577.98s]  Rio mist
[3582.80s -> 3584.94s]  Mist
[3584.94s -> 3585.98s]  Oh
[3585.98s -> 3593.28s]  30s is a corporate meddling
[3596.03s -> 3599.55s]  Oh, I don't want to be called real miss. I want to be called Mr. Satan
[3599.87s -> 3614.75s]  They'll all be chanting that name one day. Perhaps i'll give it to somebody more deserving. I got nothing scheduled. Let's do some uh training here
[3615.31s -> 3633.49s]  I changed my name
[3633.49s -> 3637.78s]  Mr. Satan forever
[3637.78s -> 3639.78s]  How's that for her name? You like that one?
[3646.99s -> 3651.57s]  Agility is so bad change him to hercule
[3659.34s -> 3661.34s]  More strength more
[3675.26s -> 3678.14s]  Matt shellman has renewed his contract with all-american wrestling
[3679.36s -> 3681.36s]  Me and jean has formed a new team
[3682.06s -> 3686.30s]  Blood brother has left strong style wrestling to pursue a career at weekend warriors
[3687.10s -> 3689.41s]  Bloody lee is sad
[3690.21s -> 3692.93s]  I'm sad
[3692.93s -> 3694.93s]  They're all they're all sad
[3699.73s -> 3702.13s]  All right, maple leaf grappling is becoming popular that guy left it
[3702.91s -> 3707.14s]  prematurely
[3707.14s -> 3713.54s]  Mr. Satan forever has been booked to face drew turnham in the last man standing match on the first week of march
[3716.99s -> 3719.39s]  All right, this is submission match versus calvin steam
[3720.19s -> 3724.29s]  We have a tv taping versus I don't know tv taping
[3724.93s -> 3727.19s]  A couple of tv tapings and then a pay-per-view
[3729.31s -> 3737.42s]  Oh shit. All right
[3737.42s -> 3739.42s]  They changed my music too
[3739.50s -> 3768.00s]  I kind of like that you look like mike meyers
[3768.96s -> 3773.74s]  I know I kind of do
[3773.74s -> 3775.10s]  calvin steam
[3775.10s -> 3776.62s]  Submission match
[3776.62s -> 3781.98s]  Pretty good to say. Hmm. Say it say it then. What are you gonna say? Say it. Oh, you didn't you brought a mike out
[3782.06s -> 3787.09s]  What the fuck?
[3787.09s -> 3793.36s]  Okay, well he's ready
[3793.36s -> 3795.36s]  Submission match that's my specialty
[3796.99s -> 3806.19s]  Didn't know if you knew that
[3806.19s -> 3808.19s]  Get up. What the fuck? I just did a move to him
[3808.51s -> 3818.02s]  Your specialty is murder and submission moves
[3821.39s -> 3824.27s]  No, that's not the move. I wanted to do i'm trying to do the super kick. What the fuck
[3825.63s -> 3827.23s]  I what?
[3827.23s -> 3830.06s]  Why don't they do that?
[3830.06s -> 3832.62s]  I just tried to do the super kick and they did did they change my moves?
[3836.16s -> 3843.63s]  Hold on a minute. Yeah, I guess I changed. I don't have the super kick anymore. They changed my moves. Are you serious?
[3849.28s -> 3851.04s]  I didn't have that before
[3851.04s -> 3857.36s]  I don't like this new character. I want to be mr. Satan forever
[3859.73s -> 3869.66s]  I got nerfed
[3869.66s -> 3872.30s]  All my moves that I was good with oh fuck
[3874.54s -> 3876.54s]  Rio mist sucks
[3884.30s -> 3891.06s]  Oh shit
[3891.06s -> 3892.50s]  Oh my god
[3892.50s -> 3909.55s]  I have to resort to just like violence. No, why am I attacking her?
[3911.50s -> 3915.81s]  Why was I aiming at her? All right, let's pull this together here
[3922.83s -> 3930.90s]  Yeah, they gave me just shitty default wrestling moves. None of my cool moves are here anymore and then do any damage
[3933.95s -> 3951.33s]  I have to just rely on my strength just rely on my strength striking moves small moves punches kicks
[3952.70s -> 3953.82s]  weapons
[3953.82s -> 3958.22s]  Yeah rely on the strength if they're gonna they're gonna take shit away from me do what I know I can do best
[3958.38s -> 3973.12s]  Do you think they can't take this away from me? You can't take it away from me. Yeah, go ahead fold me up. That's fine
[3977.63s -> 3983.54s]  Ow, I need to use my rage. I do

[4007.18s -> 4009.12s]  What how did that miss?
[4009.12s -> 4015.62s]  That's impossible. I'm as big as the side of the ring. There's one
[4016.48s -> 4023.73s]  No, I counted that miss
[4032.64s -> 4050.51s]  Use your strength. Oh, I don't did I do this for money? I had to change my character change my moves
[4051.07s -> 4054.03s]  So I would stop beating up fucking rookies
[4068.46s -> 4072.14s]  They have to nerf me and take uh, yeah, you can't take it all away from me though
[4075.60s -> 4080.40s]  Oh, yeah, you're now, you know, now, you know my plan, you know, you can't take the striking away from me now. You're afraid
[4081.12s -> 4088.21s]  That's fine. Don't worry. I'd be afraid too if I had to hit these fucking punches in the face
[4094.98s -> 4105.09s]  really
[4105.09s -> 4107.17s]  I was on the ground for so long. Don't let him submit me
[4107.81s -> 4118.99s]  Sorry, i'm too big. All right. Now let's this is gonna hurt a lot hurt him

[4178.53s -> 4186.30s]  Get up here here. You want me to change my voice i'm about to change yours permanently. That's not my move anymore
[4186.54s -> 4190.72s]  That's not my move anymore. That's not my move anymore. That's not my movie more that move sucks
[4196.90s -> 4204.83s]  They made my move a kneeling chin drop. Oh my god. How am I gonna make this guy submit?

[4309.98s -> 4321.22s]  That was intense
[4321.22s -> 4325.14s]  Alvin steam status has not been affected. Mr. Satan status has not been affected
[4328.43s -> 4339.10s]  What they're trying to hold me down. That's really what's going on
[4344.14s -> 4348.38s]  Okay, my contract with strong style expires next week. This is the last appearance potentially
[4348.94s -> 4351.33s]  You're gonna resign me
[4351.33s -> 4358.22s]  Mr. Satan forever. What do you think of a new outfit for your wardrobe department created for you?
[4362.72s -> 4370.78s]  Here's a blue diaper

[4419.63s -> 4421.46s]  well, uh

[4427.66s -> 4432.30s]  Really got really gravitating towards you. Would you be my partner?
[4437.38s -> 4440.90s]  We don't even work for the same company. So I don't see that happening anytime soon

[4497.09s -> 4500.48s]  Can I like challenge him to a fight and just kick the ever-living shit out of him?
[4500.72s -> 4509.55s]  Sorry, I don't think of myself as a wrestler. Perhaps you should ask
[4515.04s -> 4526.50s]  All right, what about derrick switchoff federation online

[4635.46s -> 4637.70s]  If rustle haystacks and I can't come to an agreement
[4637.70s -> 4643.81s]  This might very well be my last appearance in case that happens
[4643.81s -> 4646.77s]  I want to take this opportunity to express how much i've enjoyed wrestling for you
[4647.17s -> 4654.54s]  I've had a lot of ups and downs in this ring as well as behind the scenes, but I have no regrets
[4655.58s -> 4665.46s]  Anyway, i'm not out of here yet. There's one last ass to kick. So let's make it a memorable one. This guy right now is going like
[4668.02s -> 4670.02s]  This guy kills people in the ring, what does he mean?
[4672.02s -> 4674.66s]  Why does it have to be me that had to be on this roster tonight?
[4675.46s -> 4681.09s]  Mr. Satan just said he wanted to make it a memorable one
[4685.92s -> 4697.92s]  Wow, these are just throw dirt in my face death imminent
[4699.09s -> 4701.09s]  No, i'm not gonna kill this guy

[4722.69s -> 4724.69s]  And he's never to be heard from again
[4741.98s -> 4744.42s]  Just use the strength. That's all I have to do
[4744.42s -> 4751.04s]  Can't even hurt me notice how they change my moves from being punches to kicks
[4752.96s -> 4757.52s]  Mm-hmm. I only have like one upper punch in the face. That's it
[4758.08s -> 4762.75s]  I thought that was a shining reference
[4765.95s -> 4770.37s]  Wait, that's not from suicide squad

[5021.76s -> 5023.76s]  King david has defeated air miles
[5024.16s -> 5026.99s]  I think that's mankind, right? But it's not
[5027.71s -> 5040.08s]  Okay, mr satan forever's contract for the strong style wrestling has expired

[5258.30s -> 5264.62s]  No, I can look i'm gonna embarrass this guy. You may have won last time. Mr satan, but one win doesn't mean anything in this business
[5264.94s -> 5266.94s]  No, it doesn't but like four do
[5267.42s -> 5293.15s]  In a row each time we have fought every time a bat's allowed. No, they're not. Hey, well look
[5293.23s -> 5295.23s]  I might have a new friend in alan gator
[5297.10s -> 5298.30s]  Alligator
[5298.30s -> 5306.74s]  What is that? What do you throw? That was weird?
[5315.12s -> 5321.78s]  Mike was on the ground. All right

[5373.55s -> 5375.55s]  So we're gonna see what my back special is

[5417.68s -> 5421.68s]  Alan gator's profile has dropped considerably after being criticized by the press. What did he do?
[5424.94s -> 5428.00s]  What are these

[5433.98s -> 5437.57s]  I'm not convinced you'll ever be a champion
[5437.57s -> 5439.57s]  Which makes me wonder what you're doing here
[5443.47s -> 5447.39s]  Win a championship by the fourth week of march or we'll have to accept it's never going to happen
[5449.73s -> 5451.73s]  Well, give me a fucking title match then
[5452.13s -> 5453.97s]  Give me a title match

[5623.44s -> 5625.44s]  I want my big attack

[5663.94s -> 5671.04s]  We're going for something crazy. That sounds pretty good
[5671.78s -> 5673.86s]  How just how about just a straight up just powerbomb?

[6206.77s -> 6208.77s]  Who can get pinned in this?
[6209.55s -> 6211.55s]  The referee can't handle this
[6211.87s -> 6214.46s]  Are you serious?
[6214.46s -> 6216.46s]  Why could the referee do anything?

[8042.94s -> 8045.26s]  Like that was not canon. I was like, all right guys
[8045.34s -> 8048.54s]  I'm probably gonna end the stream here and if in a little bit and like probably like 10 minutes or so
[8049.18s -> 8051.26s]  So like at that point when no long it was not canon
[8051.98s -> 8062.35s]  That was just oh it's end of the stream whatever like i'm like i'm just talking and hanging out
[8062.91s -> 8071.55s]  This guy's actually a pretty formidable opponent
[8077.98s -> 8083.47s]  Get it. He died of natural causes. No
[8084.27s -> 8088.80s]  Into the corner. Oh, maybe not

[8102.46s -> 8107.33s]  And what about demento's death?
[8108.13s -> 8114.05s]  You see you are making your canon. That's that's not even real canon that haven't happened yet. Demento is alive
[8114.78s -> 8116.78s]  He just has like a broken leg and he's like hurt
[8118.00s -> 8120.96s]  Yeah, like he like broke up his like back or something, right?

[9087.94s -> 9093.06s]  Perfect shawn is sad that mike shawshot has left all american wrestling
[9094.34s -> 9101.38s]  Maddie mcfly is glad that mike shawshot has left all american wrestling gruesome. Sharon has left all american wrestling
[9105.81s -> 9108.98s]  Okay
[9108.98s -> 9116.61s]  Hard gainer is now the champion. This is the guy that just signed me. I think that's supposed to be vince mcmahon
[9117.25s -> 9122.05s]  You make a pretty good team. Mr. Satan. How would you like to make it a regular thing?
[9124.83s -> 9128.91s]  Easy to get lost in the shuffle on your own, but we can make a much bigger impact together. Where's the gator?
[9128.91s -> 9133.92s]  Where's alan gator? I already have a teammate and where's alan gator?
[9134.40s -> 9143.01s]  Be careful what you wish for. Mr. Satan. It's better to be with me than against me. I already have a teammate

[9152.34s -> 9162.96s]  Where am I? Where's mr. Satan? He's not with me anymore
[9163.44s -> 9168.37s]  What
[9168.37s -> 9171.73s]  Wasn't he with me? He was with me here. Oh, no, I left him behind
[9173.28s -> 9176.40s]  I thought like that we were partners. I thought that meant like they'd get him too
[9177.12s -> 9182.67s]  Oh shit
[9182.67s -> 9192.78s]  I left him behind
[9192.86s -> 9193.74s]  What?
[9193.74s -> 9205.63s]  Heard you're looking for me. Mr. Satan. Uh, what do you want to talk about this time? I challenge you to a match
[9208.42s -> 9212.34s]  We didn't work for the same old company anymore. I don't see that happening anytime soon
[9215.87s -> 9220.26s]  I hope I get injured
[9220.26s -> 9244.58s]  All right versus win stevenson who am I fighting this is a packed arena
[9249.30s -> 9251.62s]  But you have the same name you have the same music
[9254.78s -> 9256.70s]  It's the same music
[9256.70s -> 9267.36s]  That's just a slowed down version of my music. I've waited a long time for this moment
[9267.36s -> 9269.36s]  And I can't wait to set about achieving my goals
[9271.25s -> 9277.06s]  You just you just pitched it down. I if perfect sean thinks he's the future of all american wrestling
[9277.30s -> 9279.94s]  Perhaps i'll have to challenge for the united states title
[9281.57s -> 9286.53s]  Or maybe i'll form my own team and give battering ron and bill dozer is something to worry about
[9289.20s -> 9295.52s]  In my quest to own all of the gold I might even chase becky lane for that women's title
[9296.83s -> 9299.87s]  But of course my ultimate aim is to win the world title
[9300.35s -> 9304.59s]  And replace jigsaw jeremy as the face of the company
[9305.89s -> 9311.65s]  Sorry to wake you up from that sweet dream, but there's nobody you should be focused on more than me while you're holding two mics

[10275.71s -> 10281.12s]  How come I get less people?
[10281.12s -> 10283.84s]  Wait a minute. I have one two, three, four five
[10284.90s -> 10287.14s]  This guy has like 15 fucking people
[10293.73s -> 10298.53s]  This is not fair
[10298.53s -> 10302.45s]  Hey duke mini man. Can you believe that we've been booked to face each other in this match?
[10303.09s -> 10308.78s]  This is just scripted. Yeah, things could get awkward, but I hope you appreciate that
[10308.78s -> 10310.78s]  I can't go easy on you just because we're friends
[10313.94s -> 10331.54s]  Don't worry, I wouldn't have it any other way. I can't afford to lose this match either. Who's the ref?
[10333.44s -> 10335.44s]  All right. This is so unfair though
[10338.78s -> 10341.34s]  Just look at how many people are in this person's corner. This is ridiculous
[10346.94s -> 10348.62s]  Who's the legal one?
[10348.62s -> 10350.62s]  Wait, it's this guy
[10359.31s -> 10361.31s]  You're like the hulk. It's fine
[10361.71s -> 10365.46s]  I really am
[10365.46s -> 10369.46s]  All right, it's illegal to use that but it's illegal for me to drop him on his head on the way
[10370.02s -> 10375.06s]  You know what I mean? I don't think so
[10375.30s -> 10385.28s]  Jerma you're worse than rio mist. What are you talking about? I haven't lost a match in like an hour

[10479.95s -> 10485.33s]  You better pay a hundred dollars towards the damages. Oh, that's okay. Fine. What did I do?
[10492.74s -> 10494.74s]  Need to agree for attitude gains
[10494.82s -> 10503.33s]  All right, that makes sense
[10503.33s -> 10514.94s]  Newbie nate. Okay. Have you ever worked with a wrestler called aftershock here at all american wrestling?
[10515.34s -> 10522.21s]  His contract is up for renewal soon. So we'd be interested to know if you have any feedback
[10522.21s -> 10529.63s]  What would be a better attitude for me to say yes or no? We need to keep him or he doesn't belong here. What would be better?
[10532.21s -> 10533.78s]  for attitude
[10533.78s -> 10536.38s]  Probably yes
[10536.38s -> 10537.82s]  We need to keep him
[10537.82s -> 10543.42s]  Look how good my attitude is
[10543.42s -> 10546.78s]  All right. I don't have no idea what this one is. Oh shit 79 almost there

[10551.36s -> 10553.44s]  And it's a last laugh match
[10554.00s -> 10556.90s]  I think we're about to find out what that means. I have no idea
[10559.17s -> 10563.90s]  I can't uh, I cannot upgrade attitude. It's one of the things you cannot do. Let's see what this is
[10566.91s -> 10577.12s]  Last laugh is it the last person to laugh?
[10577.76s -> 10590.90s]  Okay, bart simpson running the chalkboard. Keep the attitude up. I will not attack anybody the commentary table
[10591.22s -> 10593.86s]  I won't throw a weapon at anybody. I'm gonna just wrestle this guy
[10600.93s -> 10602.93s]  You laugh you lose. Yeah, but
[10603.89s -> 10607.09s]  How does that I don't understand this match?
[10608.83s -> 10613.39s]  Mr satan, you're not popular enough to be a champion. It's about time that title went to a real star like me
[10613.95s -> 10620.99s]  This title is too big for your little waist. You're punching above your weight jigsaw jeremy
[10621.55s -> 10627.58s]  How does this work? I don't get it. What do we do?
[10628.14s -> 10636.29s]  How do I don't know what this means?
[10636.29s -> 10638.45s]  Last to get a pin within the time limit
[10639.09s -> 10642.91s]  What?
[10642.91s -> 10647.87s]  Two minute time limit and it's the last person to get pinned or to get a pin
[10648.59s -> 10650.59s]  All right. Well, just let's just hurt him
[10650.59s -> 10651.79s]  That's all I know
[10651.79s -> 10654.03s]  Just hurt hurt other guy. You got it
[10665.20s -> 10684.10s]  Um, that's by eating something on the way in here and good more punches
[10688.51s -> 10691.23s]  He's just trying to get that at it. He's almost ready for a pin

[12514.69s -> 12516.69s]  I think i'm seven four
[12517.54s -> 12519.55s]  Am I seven four?
[12519.55s -> 12533.50s]  I think so. I don't know. How tall is this guy seven?
