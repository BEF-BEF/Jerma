[0.31s -> 13.69s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[13.69s -> 17.66s]  It's been a while since I've seen some Facecam Fortress 2, and I do apologize about that.
[17.66s -> 22.96s]  What the hell? What? What? Whoa, hey! That guy's like glitching through the gate!
[22.96s -> 25.86s]  Uh, this is Balloon Race, by the way, if you didn't know.
[25.86s -> 28.86s]  How did that guy, like, get through the gate? What a freak show.
[28.86s -> 32.02s]  Gonna do some Facecam Fortress on Balloon Race.
[32.02s -> 35.97s]  What the hell? Music is playing in the background right now.
[35.97s -> 37.37s]  Get back on that ship.
[37.37s -> 40.67s]  What's up, everybody?
[41.67s -> 43.07s]  Oh, oh, oh!
[43.07s -> 45.75s]  What? Did they spawn, like...
[45.75s -> 46.75s]  What? What?
[46.75s -> 49.15s]  I have no idea how this mode really, like, works.
[49.15s -> 51.23s]  Oh, Scout!
[51.23s -> 53.03s]  They're just, like, appearing on our ship?
[53.03s -> 55.42s]  BS.
[55.42s -> 59.05s]  What the? Get what? Pyro, get the hell out of here, man!
[59.05s -> 65.26s]  How are they getting on our boat? I wish I, like, played this for, like, 15 seconds before recording.
[65.26s -> 67.67s]  Oh, get that medic.
[67.67s -> 70.63s]  Give me an overheal, baby. Give me an overheal.
[70.63s -> 72.60s]  Get out of here, Scout!
[72.60s -> 76.18s]  Get out of here, Pyro! People are just, like, glitching onto the boat.
[76.18s -> 78.33s]  Help me! Help me!
[78.33s -> 80.90s]  Oh, sick dispenser, baby.
[80.90s -> 82.78s]  Right now, bang.
[82.78s -> 84.58s]  Oh, you can't... Oh, you can shoot through. Good.
[84.58s -> 87.14s]  Good, good, good. I was gonna say, that would suck.
[87.14s -> 90.36s]  Give me more health. This guy's trying to shoot in the window.
[90.36s -> 93.46s]  Oh, I gotta lead my targets a little bit here.
[93.46s -> 94.86s]  Try and get it in the window.
[94.86s -> 96.23s]  I got it in the window.
[96.23s -> 98.54s]  This is ridiculous.
[98.54s -> 100.23s]  They're gonna win!
[100.23s -> 102.70s]  Oh, get crit!
[102.70s -> 105.79s]  All right, seriously, I need some, uh... I need a medic.
[105.79s -> 107.23s]  I need a medic right now.
[107.23s -> 109.39s]  Heal me, man. Heal me.
[109.39s -> 111.22s]  Come on, heal me.
[111.22s -> 112.22s]  Come on!
[114.80s -> 118.94s]  Oh, man!
[118.94s -> 122.49s]  Let's get up there. I don't have enough health to get up there, actually.
[122.49s -> 124.52s]  Damn it. Oh, I'm so scared.
[124.52s -> 125.92s]  It's all right. Get out of here, Heavy.
[125.92s -> 129.18s]  Get the hell... bang!
[129.18s -> 131.44s]  Bang!
[131.44s -> 133.46s]  Can I climb the ladder?
[133.46s -> 135.26s]  Oh, my God, I can climb the ladder!
[135.26s -> 137.54s]  I ca...
[137.54s -> 139.51s]  Apparently, I killed two people.
[139.51s -> 143.30s]  So, that's how people are getting on the boat. All right.
[143.30s -> 147.27s]  Here we go, baby. Rocket jump!
[147.27s -> 150.26s]  Get out of my face!
[150.26s -> 152.34s]  Uh...
[152.34s -> 155.14s]  I kinda wanna climb up this thing again. I'm gonna die instantly.
[155.14s -> 157.14s]  Ah!
[157.14s -> 163.99s]  I did it again. I killed myself again.
[163.99s -> 165.59s]  All right, I'm not going over there just yet.
[165.59s -> 169.45s]  I'm gonna get, uh... I'm gonna get my rage up a little bit here.
[169.45s -> 172.96s]  So, how the hell do you, uh...
[172.96s -> 177.62s]  How the hell do you move the boat from here?
[177.62s -> 179.42s]  What? What? Hey, whoa!
[179.42s -> 181.58s]  Whoa, what is this guy doing in here?
[181.58s -> 184.15s]  What? This guy's in our spawn!
[184.15s -> 187.64s]  That's the glitching demo man from the beginning.
[187.64s -> 189.54s]  What a son of a bitch.
[189.54s -> 194.11s]  The guy's just, like, hanging out in the spawn with his, like, glitches.
[194.11s -> 195.95s]  Let me just hit a tree real quick.
[195.95s -> 197.15s]  All right, here we go.
[197.15s -> 198.55s]  What's up, everybody?
[198.55s -> 200.13s]  Mini Sentry, screw you!
[200.13s -> 202.61s]  Come here, you...
[202.61s -> 204.91s]  We don't even have the first point capped.
[204.91s -> 208.03s]  How do you cap points?
[208.03s -> 211.67s]  I have no idea what's happening.
[211.67s -> 213.03s]  I got him.
[213.03s -> 216.99s]  Pyro coming down the stairs.
[216.99s -> 220.70s]  Oh, so we have to cap that?
[220.70s -> 223.13s]  We just, like, stand on the treasure chest?
[223.13s -> 224.13s]  All right, I think I get it now.
[224.13s -> 227.75s]  I think... What? Oh.
[227.75s -> 232.57s]  Get... I seriously have no clue.
[232.57s -> 233.97s]  It's definitely the treasure chest.
[233.97s -> 242.10s]  All right, now knowing that, I'm hanging out up here.
[242.10s -> 243.78s]  Come here.
[243.78s -> 244.98s]  Oh, let me help this heavy out.
[244.98s -> 246.42s]  Let's get it! Let's cap it!
[246.42s -> 247.46s]  Come on!
[247.46s -> 249.30s]  Come on, everybody! Come on!
[249.30s -> 252.65s]  Ugh! Dammit!
[252.65s -> 256.09s]  This is point number one.
[256.09s -> 259.72s]  There's so much going on right now for my tiny brain to handle.
[259.72s -> 260.52s]  Oh, we got it. We got it.
[260.52s -> 264.34s]  Good, good, good. Good job. Good job.
[264.34s -> 267.10s]  Shoot it back in that window, baby.
[267.10s -> 268.94s]  Let's get this boat moving.
[268.94s -> 271.14s]  Oh, ship. I keep calling it different things.
[271.14s -> 274.17s]  Get back down here.
[274.17s -> 274.97s]  Let's hide down here.
[274.97s -> 278.46s]  Ah...
[278.46s -> 279.86s]  This heavy's freaking out.
[279.86s -> 283.73s]  That's a good thing.
[283.73s -> 286.54s]  Oh, long shot. Long shot.
[286.54s -> 288.54s]  I'm standing still right now.
[288.54s -> 291.27s]  This is not gonna be good.
[291.27s -> 293.41s]  There we go.
[293.41s -> 299.16s]  This huntsman right is just in his glory mode.
[299.16s -> 300.56s]  They're all swimming.
[300.56s -> 302.66s]  They're all swimming over here.
[302.66s -> 305.09s]  Oh, let's beach it. Let's beach it.
[305.09s -> 306.49s]  Oh, yeah, we're beaching it.
[306.49s -> 309.54s]  This guy's toast right here.
[309.54s -> 311.96s]  He died before I could even get to him.
[311.96s -> 312.76s]  Oh, no, you don't.
[312.76s -> 313.76s]  Oh, no, you don't.
[313.76s -> 317.55s]  Oh, no, you don't.
[317.55s -> 318.35s]  Oh, boy.
[318.35s -> 319.53s]  I'm in trouble.
[319.53s -> 321.34s]  I'm in trouble.
[321.34s -> 323.05s]  Are they teleporters?
[323.05s -> 325.05s]  I am so confused right now.
[325.05s -> 326.29s]  I'm going in a teleporter.
[326.29s -> 327.49s]  Can I destroy these?
[327.49s -> 329.88s]  No, let's go in.
[329.88s -> 331.63s]  Can I go in?
[331.63s -> 336.15s]  Dammit, you can't go in.
[336.15s -> 338.38s]  Get out of town here.
[338.38s -> 339.87s]  Oh, I can go...
[339.87s -> 340.87s]  Apparently, I died.
[340.87s -> 341.87s]  Don't know how.
[341.87s -> 342.87s]  Apparently, a mini-century.
[342.87s -> 344.18s]  Who knows?
[344.18s -> 346.63s]  Whoa.
[346.63s -> 347.63s]  Dude.
[347.63s -> 349.23s]  Oh, somebody get hit by that crit.
[349.23s -> 352.30s]  No, I didn't do good enough.
[352.30s -> 356.90s]  Well, we're way behind right now.
[356.90s -> 357.70s]  Shoot it.
[357.70s -> 360.89s]  Let me shoot through that thing.
[360.89s -> 363.89s]  This guy's got a wrangled mini-century.
[363.89s -> 369.72s]  All right, let's go.
[369.72s -> 371.72s]  I'm going to cause absolute carnage right here.
[371.72s -> 373.02s]  You ready for this?
[373.02s -> 375.25s]  Carnage mode activated.
[375.25s -> 376.62s]  Stickies.
[376.62s -> 377.82s]  You're pushing me off.
[377.82s -> 379.76s]  Let's push.
[379.76s -> 382.16s]  The thing, the boat pushed me off the frigging...
[382.16s -> 392.34s]  Let's go here.
[392.34s -> 393.54s]  Is he going to get hit by that crit?
[393.54s -> 394.34s]  He's standing still.
[394.34s -> 400.57s]  Oh, I killed two people.
[400.57s -> 402.86s]  I killed two people with that.
[402.86s -> 405.42s]  Are you kidding me?
[405.42s -> 407.91s]  No, you're pushing me off.
[407.91s -> 411.11s]  That big fat bastion heavy just shoved me off of it.
[411.11s -> 412.81s]  Oh, you...
[412.81s -> 415.11s]  Oh my God, that was crazy.
[415.11s -> 416.71s]  We are so far behind.
[416.71s -> 417.71s]  I don't know where I'm going,
[417.71s -> 418.91s]  but apparently, we're going down here.
[418.91s -> 419.71s]  Get everybody.
[419.71s -> 423.62s]  Give me like a triple kill right here.
[423.62s -> 426.90s]  Heal me, Medic.
[426.90s -> 429.30s]  Come here, you...
[429.30s -> 430.54s]  He's dead.
[430.54s -> 433.25s]  Ugh.
[433.25s -> 435.25s]  Balloon Race is out of control.
[435.25s -> 436.45s]  Holy crap.
[436.45s -> 440.94s]  Nobody on...
[440.94s -> 444.49s]  All right, get on that point.
[444.49s -> 449.85s]  I got to land some shots.
[449.85s -> 453.31s]  Oh, they're all coming up here right now.
[453.31s -> 454.71s]  That guy's got crits.
[454.71s -> 455.75s]  He can't hit me.
[455.75s -> 458.41s]  Aha, he can't hit me.
[458.41s -> 460.50s]  Oh, get it.
[460.50s -> 462.46s]  Get it, baby.
[462.46s -> 465.57s]  They capped that point, too.
[465.57s -> 466.17s]  I'm going to kill that...
[466.17s -> 467.17s]  No, I got him.
[467.17s -> 468.17s]  Oh, yeah.
[468.17s -> 469.97s]  I'm so happy about that shot.
[469.97s -> 471.39s]  Yeah.
[471.39s -> 472.19s]  Wait for me.
[472.19s -> 473.39s]  Wait for me, please.
[473.39s -> 474.19s]  Please.
[474.19s -> 476.74s]  Yeah, okay.
[476.74s -> 477.54s]  Janka.
[477.54s -> 478.34s]  El Doctor.
[478.34s -> 480.21s]  Dying, I'm dying.
[480.21s -> 481.25s]  I'm dying.
[481.25s -> 482.25s]  Oh, you got to heal me, Medic.
[482.25s -> 483.25s]  You got to heal me.
[483.25s -> 488.56s]  Damn it.
[488.56s -> 490.36s]  We are getting beat pretty bad right now,
[490.36s -> 491.76s]  I'm assuming.
[491.76s -> 494.72s]  Judging by the fact that we crit.
[494.72s -> 496.30s]  Didn't kill anybody with it, though.
[496.30s -> 499.80s]  And apparently, I still have the rage.
[499.80s -> 503.04s]  Oh, we're about to lose.
[503.04s -> 506.60s]  Oh, you scorch shot, son of a bitch.
[506.60s -> 507.80s]  That guy's got the right idea.
[507.80s -> 509.40s]  He's got the scorch shot.
[509.40s -> 511.10s]  You bastard.
[511.10s -> 512.77s]  Oh, it's over.
[512.77s -> 514.17s]  It is over right now.
[514.17s -> 516.69s]  It's over.
[516.69s -> 520.38s]  It is so over.
[520.38s -> 520.78s]  We can't...
[520.78s -> 522.88s]  I keep hitting those people in the back.
[522.88s -> 524.68s]  All right, we're going for an epic rocket jump super kill.
[524.68s -> 525.48s]  Here we go.
[525.48s -> 527.81s]  Oh, yeah.
[527.81s -> 531.95s]  I'm on the king of the mountain.
[531.95s -> 532.75s]  The killer.
[532.75s -> 539.12s]  I'm just going to stop whipping people.
[539.12s -> 540.52s]  Are we actually going to cap this?
[541.09s -> 544.70s]  No, we're not.
[544.70s -> 546.45s]  Oh, man.
[546.45s -> 548.65s]  I got to stay alive up here.
[548.65s -> 552.63s]  Crap.
[552.63s -> 553.83s]  This is just complete chaos.
[553.83s -> 555.63s]  Is anybody even going to be able to get this point?
[555.63s -> 558.23s]  I don't think anyone's going to be able to even cap this point.
[558.23s -> 563.84s]  It is too chaotic.
[563.84s -> 570.40s]  Get out of here.
[570.40s -> 571.40s]  See you later.
[571.40s -> 573.79s]  I'm gone.
[573.79s -> 575.95s]  Wow, blue's actually on it.
[575.95s -> 576.55s]  We're going to cap it.
[576.55s -> 578.15s]  Is this going to be a tie?
[578.15s -> 579.15s]  This is going to be a tie, right?
[579.15s -> 581.15s]  It has to be.
[581.15s -> 582.78s]  Time has been added.
[582.78s -> 584.58s]  There's more time left?
[584.58s -> 586.74s]  What else are we going to do?
[586.74s -> 595.82s]  No, don't leave without me.
[595.82s -> 599.50s]  I missed the boat.
[599.50s -> 601.30s]  So do we just go in a circle?
[601.30s -> 603.14s]  When does this end?
[603.14s -> 604.74s]  How do you like beat?
[604.74s -> 605.64s]  Oh, no vote.
[605.64s -> 607.60s]  I don't know.
[607.60s -> 608.90s]  How do you win?
[608.90s -> 610.30s]  I think we're...
[610.30s -> 614.68s]  This is just like an open field over here.
[614.68s -> 617.48s]  I've only played Balloon Race like a couple times,
[617.48s -> 618.98s]  and maybe like three or four times,
[618.98s -> 620.32s]  and I loved it,
[620.32s -> 625.61s]  but I just never really understand what the hell is going on in this game mode.
[625.61s -> 626.81s]  I'm jumping off the boat.
[626.81s -> 630.72s]  We're going to try and pick some people off.
[630.72s -> 635.27s]  Let me get a couple of long-range beauty shots.
[635.27s -> 637.07s]  Just going to clean people up as they come down.
[637.07s -> 638.07s]  What's up?
[638.07s -> 640.58s]  I got crushed.
[640.58s -> 642.68s]  You're wrangling a sentry from all the way back there.
[642.68s -> 646.42s]  Holy crap, man.
[646.42s -> 650.28s]  No, no, no.
[650.28s -> 654.92s]  Way too many people.
[654.92s -> 656.56s]  Get rid of this heavy.
[656.56s -> 658.44s]  Thank you.
[658.44s -> 660.28s]  And get rid of this guy.
[660.28s -> 661.08s]  This guy right here.
[661.08s -> 661.88s]  Get rid of him.
[661.88s -> 665.42s]  And this guy.
[665.42s -> 667.15s]  No.
[667.15s -> 668.59s]  Yay, we did it.
[668.59s -> 671.64s]  And I got on the top of the scoreboard somehow.
[671.64s -> 673.96s]  Well, that's going to be it, guys.
[673.96s -> 675.16s]  Thank you all so much for watching.
[675.16s -> 676.06s]  Really do appreciate it.
[676.06s -> 682.40s]  Balloon Race for the return of Facecam Fortress 2.
[682.40s -> 683.40s]  I'll see you guys all next time.
[683.40s -> 684.57s]  And of course...
[684.57s -> 685.81s]  Wait, we won again?
[685.81s -> 687.42s]  Is that a double victory?
[687.42s -> 688.12s]  Sweet, dude.
[688.12s -> 689.32s]  Well, I'll see you guys all next time.
[689.32s -> 691.12s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[691.12s -> 691.72s]  See you all soon.
