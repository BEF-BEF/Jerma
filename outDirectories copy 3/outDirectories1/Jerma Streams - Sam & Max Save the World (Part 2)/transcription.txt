[1.27s -> 9.40s]  He's one minute early. Well, I'm not early. As long as it's in this window. I could have started
[9.40s -> 19.24s]  about 30 or 40 minutes ago, but I was too busy shit posting in chat. It took too long. I'm sitting
[19.24s -> 25.70s]  there writing all kinds of dumb shit for 30 minutes. So I... I could have started. I just
[25.70s -> 33.00s]  had to get coffee and take out auto and stuff. So I do that to... okay, those of you that are
[33.00s -> 37.56s]  like, oh wait, he's been... why, you know, why doesn't the stream start earlier than that? I
[37.56s -> 43.80s]  mean it's like four. It's between three and four. What the heck, man? No, I... it's because I am here.
[44.76s -> 48.52s]  I just like to be a chatter sometimes for like a half an hour. It's kind of fun.
[49.50s -> 59.42s]  I do it all the time. What the heck, man? It's because it's different. I can like hunch over
[59.42s -> 67.99s]  and be like... it's a little different. Stalling? Oh, you're gonna get a big stall today because
[67.99s -> 74.36s]  I've got a fucking story for you. I'm gonna wait till people get the tweet and stuff because
[74.84s -> 88.87s]  this is a big story. Big one. Stalling. Hey, you know, is it a stall? If it's... if you... okay.
[89.67s -> 96.70s]  If the car stalls out, I understand. But I'm coasting right now. I'm idling. Stalled means
[96.70s -> 111.13s]  the engine turns off. A really big show. What is that? Go get vehicle berry? Fucking vehicle
[111.13s -> 117.30s]  berry. But yeah, today we're gonna... I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We are going to do
[118.26s -> 125.35s]  the rest of season one of Sam and Max, probably. I don't think... unless somebody can correct me
[125.35s -> 133.82s]  here... I don't think this is gonna take more than six to seven hours. Is it? Because we're
[133.82s -> 144.70s]  in the middle of episode three. Three, four, five, six, seven-ish, maybe. I'm just gonna
[144.70s -> 149.99s]  finish it tonight. We're just gonna do it. Depends on how stupid you feel today. I feel
[149.99s -> 160.30s]  pretty intelligent today. Anybody else like that? How many other people here wake up sometimes and
[160.30s -> 169.66s]  they are Albert Einstein? You can do anything. You can solve any problem, any solution, any
[169.66s -> 174.14s]  equation. You can do anything. You're easy to speak. You're easy to talk. You're easy to
[174.14s -> 180.74s]  move around. Then on some days you wake up and you can... you're like a caveman. It's...
[180.74s -> 190.34s]  seriously, it's 50-50. It's yin and yang with me. He's trying to brag here again.
[190.34s -> 199.54s]  I'm always a caveman. Sometimes I'm a caveman for two straight weeks. Sometimes I get on it and I'm
[199.54s -> 203.78s]  just super on top of everything and I get... I got something to say about that. I got something
[203.78s -> 207.75s]  to say about that. I'm gonna bring up this. Gonna bring up that. You guys have seen streams
[207.75s -> 218.38s]  before. I'm just like, hey, okay. So, um, this way. Yep. I think... I just died. You know what I mean?
[218.38s -> 229.54s]  I got... it's yin and yang. High energy, low energy. That's what that is. That's what yin and
[229.54s -> 237.98s]  yang is. Except it's not. We make funny haha videos. All right. I think we've stalled for
[237.98s -> 244.65s]  enough time. I think it's time to tell the story. Part two of The Dentist. And the funny
[244.65s -> 250.46s]  thing about this story is... wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's trash over here. Hold on.
[251.26s -> 283.22s]  Funny thing about this story. It's not a... ow! Funny thing about this story. It's not trash.
[283.22s -> 288.63s]  It's... I'm moving electronics around. It's not trash. So the funny thing about this story...
[292.62s -> 328.52s]  Come on! The funny... red skin. Stop it. It's... why won't this work? I'm trying to adjust the white
[328.52s -> 333.58s]  balance. Look, I live in Las Vegas. It's been hot. The sun's been shining. I got a sunburn.
[333.58s -> 345.05s]  Look. See? I'll prove it. See? Look. See? Look at that. See? Anyways. So I'm not the dentist
[345.05s -> 354.20s]  today. I'm not even gonna look over here. I'm minimizing chat. That means minimize.
[355.00s -> 359.56s]  All right. So listen. Those of you that remember when I said I went to The Dentist
[359.56s -> 365.16s]  a couple weeks ago, right? So I went to The Dentist a couple weeks ago. And I did part one
[365.16s -> 369.96s]  of my procedures that I was going to do. Had some x-rays. Had some... had some things done.
[369.96s -> 377.61s]  Came back for part two today. And what did I talk about? What was in The Dentist two weeks
[377.61s -> 386.09s]  ago that I made a big deal about? Uh-huh. There was a television in The Dentist office.
[387.85s -> 392.81s]  No, not teeth, right? So in this Dentist office, there is a TV with Netflix on it.
[392.81s -> 396.33s]  Remember I said, oh, I wonder what people watch when they get their teeth done? I made that
[396.33s -> 403.61s]  very specific comment. Anyways, today I'm in The Dentist office. Earlier today. This is like
[403.61s -> 410.65s]  four hours ago. So I get the remote and I've got some work to do. So I'm gonna be there
[410.65s -> 415.45s]  for like an hour or so, right? Maybe a little bit more. So I go back in the chair
[416.09s -> 420.73s]  and while I'm going back, I'm told, put on whatever you want. And I kind of panicked a little bit.
[420.73s -> 428.63s]  I didn't know what to put on. So I put on something safe. A nature documentary. Again,
[428.63s -> 435.03s]  yes. I panicked again. I do this every time. So I put on a nature documentary and it's the
[435.03s -> 440.78s]  episode. I didn't care what the fucking episode was called. The episode was called Cording.
[442.06s -> 445.42s]  It was like a BBC documentary. I'm going to describe it. You may have already seen it.
[446.14s -> 451.74s]  So Cording is on the screen. This is just playing. Netflix is just sitting there. Thankfully,
[451.74s -> 455.66s]  the volume's not turned up very high at all. So I'm in the chair going back and things are
[455.66s -> 462.84s]  normal. And I'm glancing over at this TV every now and then. Remember, Dentist is fucking in
[462.84s -> 470.89s]  my mouth. Like Dentist is in my mouth doing these things. Dentist is in his... Dentist is
[470.89s -> 477.67s]  drilling. No, he's not drilling. Dentist is using tools inside of my mouth. So
[480.71s -> 489.64s]  God damn it. Why? The... I've ruined the whole story. So the Dentist is working in my mouth while
[489.64s -> 494.22s]  the Netflix documentary is playing. So he's, you know, doing his thing. He's like,
[494.22s -> 497.74s]  do you have talk? Oh yeah. So let me see this. Let me see. Turn this way, please.
[497.74s -> 505.21s]  I glance over at the TV and there are two turtles having sex on the TV. Just fucking on
[505.21s -> 511.85s]  screen. And I'm like this. And remember, the TV is over here. So I really have to like look
[511.85s -> 516.01s]  hard and there's two turtles just going at it. And remember, the episode was called Cording.
[517.78s -> 521.94s]  I'm okay, you know? It doesn't take... Sometimes it's really easy for me to laugh and get into
[521.94s -> 526.18s]  a laughing fit. But whatever, that's fucking nature. It doesn't matter. He's sitting there,
[526.18s -> 531.46s]  still doing his thing. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you okay?
[531.46s -> 537.29s]  You okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Little do I know that this keeps going.
[537.85s -> 543.93s]  The two turtles are having sex. Another turtle. Another turtle comes from behind the other
[543.93s -> 548.41s]  turtle and starts punching this turtle in the back of the head over and over again.
[551.11s -> 560.97s]  And I'm like... Why? Why is it her? I'm telling you, this is like CIA level training
[560.97s -> 563.77s]  that I had to go through here to not laugh while the guy was fucking in my mouth doing
[563.77s -> 572.04s]  things. That's not the end of the story. So I'm going like this. And what do I see again
[572.04s -> 578.04s]  while I fucking tear my eyes down? Another turtle shows up. Just what I think. I was
[578.04s -> 582.44s]  out of the woods here. Another fucking turtle starts to fight the rest of the turtles and
[582.44s -> 590.22s]  one of two of them having sex with each other. It got to a point where I was like...
[591.02s -> 596.41s]  And he's like, are you okay? I'm like, yeah, I just got some water back here in my mouth.
[597.74s -> 600.38s]  This is just animals having sex on the screen behind him. He didn't even know.
[600.94s -> 608.89s]  This is at the dentist. And 2020 hindsight. I composed myself completely. But holy shit, man.
[614.84s -> 622.18s]  It was unbelievable. No, he didn't know. He's sitting there going like this and the TV behind
[622.18s -> 630.14s]  him is turtles having sex. It was so elaborate. Tell him you need to change the channel. Well,
[630.14s -> 637.74s]  I... You can't... What am I going to do? Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. I'm the guy that put on
[637.74s -> 650.82s]  the animals having sex. Can I change that? I put it on. We're going to play Sam and Max now.
[662.94s -> 668.79s]  Speaking of animals, it wasn't that big of a deal until the other turtle started to come
[668.79s -> 678.78s]  and punch the other turtle that was having sex in the head. It was just... It was bizarre.
[686.65s -> 695.42s]  My stand up story. No, this is just me telling a story. I think we're on this one,
[695.42s -> 715.90s]  right? That was Larry David. I knew that that Netflix shit was going to fuck me up.
[715.90s -> 719.96s]  I was certain when I went there two weeks ago and I saw that the TV was there, I knew there was
[719.96s -> 726.60s]  going to be a problem. I've tried to put on something safe. And here's the worst part
[726.60s -> 730.44s]  about that. I'll end the story and we'll move on. But here's the worst part about that entire
[730.44s -> 738.07s]  thing. If I had just put on something like Cupcake Wars, I would have cracked and laughed
[738.07s -> 743.86s]  at that show for some reason. I was able to keep it together during the animals having sex.
[752.23s -> 757.05s]  Life story, season one, episode five, courtship. There it is. That is the exact
[757.05s -> 761.61s]  episode. Just watch The Power of the Turtles. You tell me... You watch that fucking episode
[761.61s -> 765.61s]  right now. Just delete... Get out of the stream. Watch that episode right now and you tell me
[765.61s -> 768.81s]  that if you're in the dentist lying in the chair, you're going to have no problem with that
[768.81s -> 791.86s]  one. Show it on stream? I can't. Ah, fuck. This is the guy that laughed at fart jokes
[791.86s -> 803.94s]  for an hour. Yeah, but what was I supposed to do with that scenario? I don't know. It's
[803.94s -> 808.82s]  not something that you are expecting to see, like glaring, pulling your eyeballs down,
[808.82s -> 818.54s]  looking at a TV. All right, so now look at... Don't choose the mating show next time. I don't
[818.54s -> 823.82s]  know. I'm out of coffee but I'm so nervous I keep trying to drink it anyway. It's funny how
[823.82s -> 828.78s]  stress can reduce you to just a bundle of mindless reflexes. Is that what happened to
[828.78s -> 835.40s]  me? Wouldn't it be wonderful to think so? Do you remember messing up things at the start
[835.40s -> 848.47s]  of the stream? What do you mean? All right, well let me break down what this is. We're in
[848.47s -> 855.46s]  the middle of episode three. So if you're wondering, wait, what the hell's going on?
[855.46s -> 861.08s]  Why are you... we just jumped right in. It's because this is the middle of the episode. We
[861.08s -> 866.20s]  are tasked with doing three things. We have to kill Sybil. There's one of them, but we're
[866.20s -> 870.36s]  not going to do that. That's one of the things we have to do. So we have three tasks
[870.36s -> 881.27s]  that we need to fake, I'm assuming, right? Have you considered the possibility of staging
[881.27s -> 885.11s]  your own deaths to throw the toy mafia off the scent? That would be dishonest.
[885.19s -> 890.07s]  There's a shitload of turtles. They just don't stop coming over there. They are fighting
[890.07s -> 897.91s]  each other. The truth. You're a real antique, you know that? I mean in a good way. I've
[897.91s -> 906.33s]  always liked antiques. Okay, so we'll be back. We'll be back. I know you will.
[906.33s -> 911.53s]  You're the only two I can trust. Oh, really? She should consider guilt slinger as her
[911.53s -> 918.65s]  next profession. All right, so is there... I need to be... I need a reminder of something here.
[919.67s -> 922.23s]  We got the teddy bear box or the thing that can listen.
[926.39s -> 935.74s]  The sixth of them in the narrative. Yeah, dude, it was fucking out of control. Dude,
[935.74s -> 943.56s]  I keep having flashbacks. That's that moment. All right, magnet tokens used. I'm not going
[943.56s -> 948.58s]  to use the gun. We already did that. All right, let's go. Is there like a way I can...
[951.90s -> 956.86s]  Oh my god, I did it again. It's been like two or three weeks and I tried to leave through
[956.86s -> 972.18s]  the closet again. God damn it. Look, I had a rough day, all right? I will. I'm gonna try.
[972.18s -> 984.33s]  That actually wasn't rough. It was fucking... it was... it was fucking hilarious. But,
[984.33s -> 1007.40s]  you know. Let me move this. You guys want face cam today? Okay, that looks all right.
[1007.40s -> 1026.22s]  I gotta take up some space over here. Not too big. I don't want to get too... I don't
[1026.22s -> 1039.78s]  want to get too big here. Okay, I need a bigger face. A bigger face! All right, so,
[1042.74s -> 1046.66s]  I really... I really don't know what... where we left off here. There's the casino. This
[1046.66s -> 1056.26s]  is the casino episode. I have some new items. Let me go just walk around and talk. I have
[1056.26s -> 1061.54s]  a perfectly symmetrical face. I do not. I do not. Actually, no, I don't. I'm gonna prove it
[1061.54s -> 1068.41s]  to you right now. So, you see, my face looks like... so, if we take a look at this angle here,
[1069.21s -> 1073.69s]  my nose comes down. It actually goes this way. So, my nose actually goes in a completely
[1073.69s -> 1080.25s]  different direction. So, my nose crosses here. My mouth here goes down, right? So, as you see,
[1080.25s -> 1084.33s]  this is a straight out of my face. When we turn this way, the chin is more pronounced here
[1084.33s -> 1090.33s]  and the nose points over here, right? Sorry, this way. This eye socket is out a little
[1090.97s -> 1096.09s]  and when I turn this way, notice how the nose is pointing this way and this eye socket is back
[1097.05s -> 1102.65s]  and my chin points down a little deeper this way. Some of you have made fun of my face this
[1102.65s -> 1107.61s]  way because each day it looks like a banana and it's very rude and very mean, but I think this
[1107.61s -> 1111.69s]  is my good side. This is... I mean, you could... maybe... it depends. This could be my good
[1111.69s -> 1117.40s]  side too. You know, the little deeper set eye there. They're both good sides, I think. They're
[1117.40s -> 1124.57s]  just both very different. You don't have a good side. My mother would disagree with you.
[1137.10s -> 1146.23s]  All right, Sam and Max, where are we going? No, I do not have a symmetrical face at all.
[1146.23s -> 1156.98s]  A very rocky face. Are you only... are you reading mean comments again? Yeah. I'm sorry,
[1156.98s -> 1164.57s]  though. Oh, here's a security camera in here, right? So, this is the... this is the security
[1164.57s -> 1185.62s]  camera. Can I do anything weird with this? Hmm. Someone want to give me a little
[1185.62s -> 1190.42s]  clue here to get us on the right track? Because it's been a couple weeks. I have no idea what I'm
[1190.42s -> 1206.76s]  supposed to do right now. Well, oh, will he actually get... do this for me? I don't know,
[1206.76s -> 1218.84s]  man. It's your stream. I just... it's been a while. I gotta join the mafia, right?
[1221.45s -> 1226.33s]  That camera seems to be bulletproof. If only there were some way to get rid of arbitrary items here
[1226.33s -> 1233.69s]  in the store. Get rid of items? Irony is a sledgehammer, isn't it? So, do we have to... okay.
[1234.73s -> 1243.08s]  Shall we, Sean? Let's do... So, something... and what... does it... I can remove something from here.
[1249.58s -> 1252.46s]  Magnet? Or maybe just put the magnet on it? Does it fuck it all up?
[1253.02s -> 1273.78s]  My face cam? I'm gonna turn it off in, like, five minutes anyway. Can I distract him? What else was...
[1273.78s -> 1278.58s]  what else was... what were the other two tasks? Kill Sybil and then I don't remember what the
[1278.58s -> 1282.74s]  other two are. Is there, like, a way... well, I think we're getting... there's a new character
[1282.74s -> 1292.74s]  here. Okay. Not gonna say anything. He's watching us.
[1296.39s -> 1306.38s]  All right, so... I'd rather keep it to myself. Listening device. Shoot him, he's suspicious. Now,
[1306.38s -> 1311.64s]  he's just... he's gonna follow me around. Takes me back to my childhood. I can't go in here.
[1312.28s -> 1323.21s]  Should I go back to the casino? Okay, yeah, I need to retrieve the meatball sub,
[1324.73s -> 1331.93s]  dissuade Bosco, and kill Sybil. Okay. So, let me go back in here and see if...
[1331.93s -> 1343.67s]  and knowing that now, let me see. So, I have to stop this camera from... hold on.
[1344.31s -> 1346.46s]  Can I put anything on here?
[1366.55s -> 1369.51s]  Something that the anti-delivery camera does not recognize.
[1375.02s -> 1375.82s]  It actually is.
[1382.38s -> 1387.98s]  He will not sneak past me. Oh, no! The price of paranoia is eternal vigilance. Got it.
[1389.02s -> 1393.90s]  What if his toy mafia disguise is just a disguise? I gotta see what he's reading.
[1394.95s -> 1402.86s]  All right, so he's... no, okay. Now, Magneth on the camera. If he's pretending to do the
[1402.86s -> 1406.22s]  word jumble, he's with the Knights of Malta. So, I should be able to do something.
[1408.06s -> 1417.50s]  Suck it up. Out the door. Yeah! Eat pavement, camera!
[1418.38s -> 1421.18s]  The society pages must be sculling bones.
[1425.66s -> 1436.22s]  Got that one. All right, so now I can... now I have to persuade him. Can I put... wait a
[1436.22s -> 1440.55s]  minute. Hold on. He's gonna look over and see this. He's gonna freak out.
[1440.55s -> 1444.39s]  Pretending to read the gardening section. So, it's true. He is toy mafia.
[1444.39s -> 1447.99s]  He's gonna know that this was delivered. I hope we don't lose Bosco's friendship over this.
[1447.99s -> 1450.87s]  Me neither. He's my second favorite delusional paranoid.
[1451.11s -> 1470.62s]  Oh no! Oh no! He's coming in! We're done for, y'all! Persuade. I surrender! I surrender!
[1471.42s -> 1480.65s]  Told you this would happen! I told you he would deliver, and he delivered! I can't believe
[1480.65s -> 1484.33s]  that guy! But, are you supposed to drink after the dentist? We'll help you purge this place
[1484.33s -> 1488.25s]  of mafia contraband just as soon as we solve this case we're so incredibly busy with.
[1488.25s -> 1493.05s]  Oh yeah, you're real busy. You've done nothing but loiter around my store all day.
[1493.05s -> 1501.21s]  What can we say? We love to loiter. Only water? Oh, you mean ice coffee? Not yet. Our journey to
[1501.21s -> 1509.13s]  the dark side has just begun. I fucking hate being on camera. I'm such a fucking yin and yang
[1509.13s -> 1516.57s]  on camera. I love being on camera, but I hate being watched. Does that make any sense? I love
[1516.57s -> 1524.42s]  being on camera. I don't like being watched. Figure that one out. You'll get it. All right,
[1524.42s -> 1535.74s]  so that's one task done. Hey, wait a second. Why didn't b-task do what? Hey! My camera!
[1540.36s -> 1543.72s]  Just filmed with the camera turned off. I'm gonna just put a piece of tape on it.
[1544.44s -> 1571.51s]  All right, one out of three. Now we need to pretend to kill Sybil. What the fuck are you
[1571.51s -> 1579.72s]  talking about? All right, I got a game audio. The game audio is off. It's fine. All right,
[1579.72s -> 1584.12s]  so what else do we have? I have the listening device. I'm gonna assume maybe we get
[1584.12s -> 1590.87s]  Sybil to be like, ah, don't kill me! And then shoot the gun, right? To make it sound like,
[1590.87s -> 1607.34s]  ah, I'm dead! But then she would be a bug. Hold on. So now, okay, pull out the gun
[1608.90s -> 1616.92s]  and be like, hey, like, maybe I could just wing her. I'd better not. I have to get her
[1616.92s -> 1624.92s]  to say something. Coin? Token? How do I get her to say- You used a couple of bucks in
[1624.92s -> 1633.85s]  tokens. Thanks, but my career is about to take off, so I'll be fine. You seem nervous.
[1633.85s -> 1639.93s]  You seem, understandably, a little tense. Maybe you should switch to decaf. What? Oh, yes,
[1639.93s -> 1644.73s]  the coffee cup. I'm out of coffee, but I'm so nervous I keep trying to drink it anyway.
[1644.73s -> 1648.25s]  I'm so nervous. It's funny how stress can reduce you to just a bundle of mindless reflexes.
[1649.45s -> 1653.53s]  Is that what happened to me? Wouldn't it be wonderful- Am I more like Sam or am I more
[1653.53s -> 1663.94s]  like Max? What would you guys say? What the fuck was that? Max? I don't know.
[1664.66s -> 1671.62s]  And I know, you know, you know, you don't see it, that's why. But no, personality-wise.
[1683.62s -> 1687.94s]  What was that? If you don't know what that was, then I'm kind of glad you don't.
[1688.66s -> 1697.21s]  All right, what about, what else are- Tiki. Coffee cup. That's a token from her.
[1698.66s -> 1705.64s]  All right. What can I do with the coffee cup? Hold all my calls, please. Hey,
[1705.64s -> 1715.22s]  keep away from my intercom. Can I play with that? No, it drives people crazy.
[1716.26s -> 1724.74s]  Put poison in it? No. I have to put more coffee in it? Try this. You can't kill somebody
[1724.74s -> 1731.45s]  with coffee, can you? You can kill somebody with a coffee pot, but why would I poison a
[1731.45s -> 1740.15s]  coffee mug? One of the coffee mugs could just be used as a weapon. Tissue. Is this the kind
[1740.15s -> 1745.69s]  with hallow in the sheets or extra soft? Chloroform, actually. Some of my therapy
[1745.69s -> 1750.79s]  patients used to get a little rowdy. Too much of anything kills you. I'm afraid to touch those.
[1751.43s -> 1763.43s]  I could think of a few things. So how'd I- All right, so I need to-
[1764.31s -> 1767.67s]  I have her coffee mug. I need to get her to, like, scream or something or
[1767.67s -> 1776.62s]  a voice message or her yelling or- What do I do with the coffee mug?
[1776.62s -> 1783.56s]  Can I play with this? No. Why not? I'm gonna be doing a lot of this, so I gotta move the camera.
[1784.12s -> 1786.74s]  This is what I do when I play a game like this. I'll show you.
[1791.67s -> 1795.19s]  I got my elbow just resting over here. This is a good shot, I think,
[1795.91s -> 1799.59s]  of, like, my detached face from my body, like, cocked that way.
[1800.47s -> 1805.10s]  I've got half a mind to stretch out for a little bit. I think you have to stretch the
[1805.10s -> 1815.05s]  whole thing or it rips. You baffle me sometimes, Max. I stopped watching the stream to watch the
[1815.05s -> 1824.46s]  documentary you talked about. Give us a review. This must be how the toy mafia is keeping an eye
[1824.46s -> 1830.97s]  on Sybil. Functional and delicious looking. Wow. Turns out I don't like that angle very much at
[1830.97s -> 1839.62s]  all. I'm going back here. So can I put something over that? I feel vaguely ridiculous. You
[1839.62s -> 1843.62s]  shouldn't, Sam. There's nothing vague about it at all. So if they're monitoring what's going
[1843.62s -> 1852.20s]  on here, how can I pretend to kill her? This is what they do in the movie. I appreciate you
[1852.20s -> 1857.56s]  trying to defend me, Sam, but there's nobody there. There was a gnat, or at least I think I saw one.
[1860.71s -> 1867.85s]  Okay. I probably need something else. How do I make it look like she was poisoned or killed
[1867.85s -> 1879.53s]  or dead? You can smell me through the face cam today. I should smell like Dove body spray.
[1880.33s -> 1888.79s]  That's what I use. I go underneath both armpits and, like, across the chest once. Dove
[1888.87s -> 1900.23s]  men plus care. Clean laundry. It's the clean laundry one. I smell like clean laundry right
[1900.23s -> 1909.03s]  now. Not like puke. Somebody said puke. Fuck you. Somebody said puke. I mean, I did puke
[1909.03s -> 1924.86s]  earlier, but I washed my hands and face and shit. I'm gonna go back to the casino. What
[1924.86s -> 1942.79s]  about my office? I don't know. I still have coins. What's the third test? Take the
[1942.79s -> 1946.39s]  meatball sub back from wherever it was. Wait, is the meatball something like my trash can
[1946.39s -> 1962.09s]  or something? I don't know. Let's take a look up here. Show me the money. Show me the sandwich.
[1962.09s -> 1967.61s]  Show me the money. You show me the sandwich, I'll show you the money. I will, I tell you. Just
[1967.61s -> 1973.69s]  show me the money. I think we've got a real gun as a cap gun. Don't be scared. Trying to
[1973.69s -> 1979.21s]  vent something hot, Leonard? Like a meatball sandwich, Leonard? A meatball sandwich, you
[1979.21s -> 1984.09s]  stole, Leonard? You two stay back or I swear by my mother's bedspread, I'll shoot you both.
[1990.90s -> 1995.22s]  Excuse me, are you by any chance holding us at gunpoint with a harmless cap gun?
[1995.22s -> 1998.26s]  I'm not gonna kill us with that thing. Always a cheat, always a cheat, eh, Leonard? What?
[1998.82s -> 2002.98s]  No. Sick of a little buddy. I thought you'd never sick.
[2005.43s -> 2011.37s]  Violence, violence! Okay, Leonard, are you gonna tell us where the sandwich is or are
[2011.37s -> 2016.57s]  we gonna have to get rough with her? We put a tire on him? I'll never talk. Oh. There ain't
[2016.57s -> 2021.13s]  nothing you can do to break me. Nothing. Does your mother know what you've become?
[2021.13s -> 2026.41s]  Don't you talk about my mama. My mama's a saint. Is she the saint of stern-o-heated
[2026.41s -> 2031.69s]  fried food? Because if so, she may have another follower. Hold on, Max. I think we've just
[2031.69s -> 2037.29s]  found our captive's weak spot. Which? His uninspired diction or his laughably bad grammar?
[2037.37s -> 2041.37s]  Neither. I wish. I say we hit this cheatin' slime receptacle where it hurts the most.
[2042.01s -> 2044.57s]  Right in the mother. You mean- We're gonna go talk to mom?
[2044.57s -> 2049.05s]  That's right, Max. It's time to pull out the yo mama jokes.
[2050.01s -> 2058.17s]  Uh oh. No, not that. Anything but that. Leonard, yo mama's so fat. Uh, she's so
[2058.17s -> 2062.09s]  frat. Not good enough. Like, curdled goat's milk on a warm summer day. I can never
[2062.09s -> 2066.41s]  remember the punch lines. Like, that's funny. I remember all the punch lines, but I can never
[2066.41s -> 2070.65s]  remember the setups. I can help. Well then, Max, I think we'll have to break this two-bit
[2070.65s -> 2080.52s]  barman as a team. Follow my lead. Yo mama's so fat. She plays pool with the planets. A classic.
[2081.80s -> 2095.32s]  Yo mama's so fat. She plays- Where is it? Why am I getting minus two's for that? That is
[2095.32s -> 2109.35s]  a classic yo mama joke. But there's more. She showed up early for her own funeral.
[2110.07s -> 2113.91s]  She knitted a sweater with all her own materials. She brings coupons to the penny
[2113.91s -> 2118.63s]  arcade. If she fell in nuclear waste, no one would notice. What does that have to do with being
[2118.63s -> 2128.58s]  fat? Her mouth would make a long shorman- This is- I think I have to make this- Okay.
[2128.58s -> 2134.90s]  She has more molds than an origami accordion. Oh, it's true. It's working. Let's keep it
[2134.90s -> 2139.38s]  up a little, buddy. He's got to connect them. Okay, making grown men weep. A f*** time for
[2139.38s -> 2147.22s]  the whole family. All right. Yo mama's so radiant. That's- that's a nice thing,
[2147.22s -> 2152.10s]  though. Isn't that radiant mean she's glowing and she's wonderful? Perky. She's up. She's having
[2152.10s -> 2155.78s]  fun. She's moving around. She's thrifty. She's really quick on her feet and she can
[2156.34s -> 2165.82s]  steal things easily. Your mama's so vulgar. Yo mama's so vulgar. She beat out Sam for best
[2165.82s -> 2171.59s]  in show. Her mouth would make a long shorman blush. That's the right one, right? Her mouth
[2171.59s -> 2178.15s]  would make a long shorman blush. Oh, it hurts. It hurts. Yes, we're definitely making a dent
[2178.15s -> 2186.62s]  now. Let's keep it up a little, buddy. Okay. Your mama's so punctual. Let's take a break.
[2186.62s -> 2193.32s]  No, your mama's so punctual, thrifty, perky, radiant. These are all good qualities.
[2196.68s -> 2202.28s]  I mean, this one, unless we're talking about in the morning. You know what I'm saying?
[2203.16s -> 2217.19s]  It's probably this one. Yo mama's so thrifty. She's so thrifty. She brings coupons to the
[2217.19s -> 2225.03s]  penny arcade. She brings coupons to the penny arcade. Oh mama, make it stop. Why's he turning
[2225.03s -> 2230.63s]  red? He's getting closer to breaking. Let's keep it up, little buddy. Yeah. We've got the same tone
[2230.63s -> 2234.55s]  here, don't we? This is now when I see it in real time. I know what you're saying now.
[2235.90s -> 2238.54s]  I just have to have to see. I have to see for myself. You know what I mean?
[2243.32s -> 2254.60s]  Is it the same? Oh, whatever. Who cares? It's the lighting. Look, I had sun today
[2254.60s -> 2271.64s]  and yesterday. I live in Las Vegas. It's like 150 degrees sometimes. 120 maybe. Radiant,
[2271.64s -> 2280.09s]  perky, punctual. Punctual means you're so, you're never late. Your mama's so punctual.
[2283.03s -> 2295.75s]  The only time she's low is at a limbo contest. She showed up early for her own damn funeral.
[2295.99s -> 2303.83s]  Showed up early for her own funeral. This can all be over if you'll just tell us where the
[2303.83s -> 2312.10s]  sandwich is. No. Let's hit him one more time, Sam. Your mama's so perky. Your mama's so perky.
[2318.36s -> 2324.46s]  Oh, that's not right. She beat out Sam for best in show. She knitted a sweater with all
[2324.46s -> 2335.32s]  her own materials. The only time she's low is at a limbo contest. The only time she's low
[2335.32s -> 2344.34s]  is at a limbo contest. Oh, okay. Okay. I'll tell you where the sandwich is. Just leave my mom alone.
[2344.34s -> 2351.14s]  Red Face Streamer tortures self in cartoon violence themed video game. I never even
[2351.14s -> 2356.02s]  took the sandwich out of the casino. Hitted in the pride slot of the one-armed bandit
[2356.02s -> 2360.10s]  and then took the one-arm so no one could win it. So, oh, it's where is it? To the next
[2360.10s -> 2368.47s]  question. Where's the arm? I got it right here. Oh, jerk bag. How did you not notice that before?
[2368.47s -> 2373.51s]  I was too busy taking his cap gun to notice that extra arm. We'd best get back to the casino
[2373.51s -> 2379.83s]  and win back that sandwich. See you around, sucker. Wait, aren't you gonna untie me? Hello,
[2380.47s -> 2386.23s]  guys? No, we're gonna keep you tied up and have the rats eat you. Anybody? Yeah,
[2387.11s -> 2395.85s]  see you in like six days. Was that too much? That might have been too much. I wouldn't leave them
[2395.85s -> 2399.45s]  there for six days. I'd leave them there for like a minute and I'd come back and be like,
[2399.45s -> 2403.13s]  okay, we'll untie you now and send you the proper authorities to deal with you.
[2404.09s -> 2409.82s]  Yin and yang, guys. You guys, I'm too spulked. It's like, you know, lawful
[2410.70s -> 2420.12s]  and then fucking unlawful. They live together. All right, so now I just need to kill civil.
[2420.76s -> 2429.77s]  Let's go back to the casino and do this. Where are we going, Sam? Teddy bears mafia
[2429.77s -> 2435.05s]  free playland. Lawful good and lawful good. What would lawful good even mean?
[2437.51s -> 2440.71s]  You're not the guy that does anything bad or good. You just laugh at the jokes.
[2442.71s -> 2446.71s]  No, you laugh at clean good jokes. You don't laugh at like dirty mean jokes.
[2446.71s -> 2452.95s]  Mafia free playland. Lawful evil would be you laughing like mean shit. The mafia plays
[2452.95s -> 2458.65s]  for free. And raffle neutral means you decide between, you know, laughing and,
[2458.65s -> 2461.85s]  you know, maybe you think something is funny but you shouldn't but you still laugh at it.
[2463.77s -> 2472.58s]  All right, let's go this way. Chaotic raffle. Chaotic raffle. Hey, the one-armed bandit's one
[2472.58s -> 2497.08s]  arm is missing. Stolen by a bandit perhaps? Why? I still don't get it. There's only two.
[2499.48s -> 2516.74s]  Presto. Shitting Mario and the gnome. No other exist. I want like an ASCII of my face.
[2519.14s -> 2522.18s]  I'd still ban it but like I don't want that.
[2532.17s -> 2538.41s]  What the fuck? What the fuck is shitting Mario? You don't want to know. You do not want to
[2538.41s -> 2545.69s]  know the answer to that question. Let me see that. Yes, that's definitely the sandwich.
[2545.69s -> 2552.84s]  Teddy bear will be very pleased. What is he talking about? Generally yes. Hey Sam,
[2552.84s -> 2556.60s]  are we mafia yet? I can't explain that. Well, there's still that little matter of rubbing
[2556.60s -> 2560.84s]  out our hands. My hands are so much bigger than my head. Oh right. It's so easy to forget
[2560.84s -> 2575.16s]  these things. All right, now he's gonna kill Sybil. The son has scorched his brain.
[2575.96s -> 2583.16s]  I have the cap gun though. Cap gun, coffee, shoot. Okay, this is where we're getting some
[2583.16s -> 2590.06s]  knowledge here. Cap gun makes the bang. She falls back and pretends to die, screams. It's
[2590.06s -> 2597.51s]  all on camera. I'm gonna walk up to her. I'm gonna listen, Sybil. This is what we're
[2597.51s -> 2601.27s]  gonna do. I'm gonna shoot you with this cap gun and then Max is gonna scream in obscenity.
[2602.15s -> 2624.54s]  He's right. I will. Easy little buddy. I'm gonna go something like that. You crack me up.
[2624.54s -> 2636.50s]  You crack me up little screamer. All right, listen, I've got something for you. Just what
[2636.50s -> 2655.11s]  do you think you're doing? Looks like he missed her. How do I? I don't understand how do I make
[2655.11s -> 2662.70s]  her pretend like she's falling. Maybe she's, can I put something in the coffee and she fall?
[2662.70s -> 2670.02s]  I don't, but why wouldn't I just tell her to pretend to fall? I'm afraid to touch those.
[2670.02s -> 2674.18s]  I'm afraid to touch. Can I put them in something? Can I put them in the coffee?
[2674.18s -> 2681.66s]  Who wouldn't want us leaving her cup there? How do I pick up something like that? Stop
[2681.66s -> 2691.80s]  flexing your shoulders. Do whatever I want, okay? Have you stop me? It's the cap gun,
[2691.80s -> 2701.18s]  but she has to fall down. What's that you keep doing with your arm? What? Oh, I think there
[2701.18s -> 2706.58s]  was a coffee cup here a minute ago. Throw boiling hot coffee in her face. Yikes is right.
[2707.22s -> 2716.31s]  Are you sure we can't talk you into faking your own death? I'm sure. We'll be back.
[2716.31s -> 2721.67s]  I know you will. You're the only two I can trust. All right. Fine. Really? She should consider
[2721.67s -> 2728.15s]  guilt slinger as her next profession. Give her coffee. So maybe I go to the coffee,
[2728.15s -> 2732.71s]  go to Bosco's and get coffee. Give her the coffee. Make sure it's not coffee she wants.
[2733.43s -> 2742.62s]  Have her go into it like a caffeine binge. But what's that going to do? She's going
[2742.62s -> 2746.78s]  to clean her house and do all of her taxes early. What about that? A lot of caffeine.
[2746.78s -> 2763.45s]  What's that going to do to you? Your ear looks infected. That's probably just hair.
[2776.01s -> 2781.00s]  He's getting redder. I'm not getting redder. All right. Next time I see the word red,
[2783.77s -> 2802.76s]  I'll just ban the word red. Hey guys, what color is that coffee pot? Why do I have no
[2802.76s -> 2818.55s]  power here? I can't clear the chat. How do I have no power in my own stream? I have to
[2818.55s -> 2823.10s]  talk to fucking Dave Twitch about that one. What's going on there? All right. I need the
[2823.10s -> 2837.16s]  coffee. Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Give her a smudgy? What's that called?
[2839.32s -> 2862.44s]  A smudgy? Put nacho cheese in it? I put ketchup in here. Does this be blood?
[2866.78s -> 2872.54s]  So I have to shoot the throw the ketchup all over and then shoot the cap gun?
[2873.34s -> 2889.05s]  What about the freezer? Is she going to like hold it over and just sludge it on top of her
[2889.05s -> 2902.98s]  head? Find out what happens. Can you do another bicep curls video to celebrate 225,000 followers?
[2905.91s -> 2909.64s]  I don't think I could lift it. I'm not sure I could actually lift it, so no.
[2910.28s -> 2920.62s]  Can you add more space to the side of your head though? Oh, my OCD is killing me. Yeah,
[2920.62s -> 2932.15s]  I'll fix it. Wait, did you want more? Oh, you're talking about over here. I see what you mean.
[2932.15s -> 2939.00s]  There you go. Perfect. Can you make your head a little wider? Yeah. Why is it too thin for
[2939.00s -> 2955.91s]  you? Yeah, I could do that. Oh my goodness. Thank you. I'd lose my head if it wasn't
[2955.91s -> 2961.91s]  attached. That's never stopped me. Make it a little bit wider. I mean, if that makes you
[2961.91s -> 2975.94s]  comfortable and happy, I don't want to make you, you know. She's just drinking the ketchup.
[2980.18s -> 2990.33s]  We'll be back. I know you will. You're the only two. Dude, can you bet it's not fitting my
[2990.33s -> 2994.65s]  widescreen TV? Oh, fuck. That's right. We've got 4k televisions now. I forgot. I'm sorry,
[2994.65s -> 3001.74s]  guys. I know. I'm still trying to get the hang of this. That should fit the 4k screen,
[3001.74s -> 3024.92s]  right? Hold on. Holy shit. Look at how fucked up I look. This is like uncanny valley.
[3031.05s -> 3043.43s]  That's terrifying. I look like a fucking lizard. Or it rips. You baffle me sometimes. I need to do
[3043.43s -> 3047.03s]  this. I have to make it. I have to make the one fucking awful joke of the evening. Here we go.
[3047.03s -> 3055.51s]  You ready? No, I want to hit him. I think I've had enough of you for the moment. Okay. But
[3055.51s -> 3061.45s]  be sure to. I don't think I can get this done. I want to like whack him and then have
[3061.45s -> 3081.82s]  me get Goompa crushed. Never mind. Just what do you think you're doing? Looks like he
[3081.82s -> 3087.61s]  missed her. Can I shoot the coffee cup and have the blood go everywhere?
[3095.30s -> 3102.46s]  What? No, that's not how that works. What? No, I just actually killed her.
[3102.46s -> 3111.22s]  It wouldn't block the bullet. I actually killed her. What happened to the picture?
[3111.22s -> 3118.06s]  Who cares? Now that she's whacked, we don't need to keep watching her, do we?
[3118.06s -> 3122.54s]  It went through the coffee cup and hit her in the chest. These things always make me
[3123.40s -> 3129.24s]  You're a real sociopath, Don Bear. I mean that as a compliment, naturally. Naturally.
[3132.23s -> 3137.51s]  Hey Sam, webcam tastes like chicken. Good idea, John. Now those toy mafia goons won't
[3137.51s -> 3140.79s]  see Sybil wake up, which could be important to our continued good health. Well,
[3140.79s -> 3144.47s]  you won't see her wake up either. We've learned that webcams go great with ketchup.
[3145.03s -> 3147.35s]  Another fun fact to add to the crime fighting arsenal.
[3154.73s -> 3160.17s]  Is this right? This is longer. You know what? I think we are. Let's go and see
[3160.17s -> 3168.97s]  Chuckles. Sam, Max, you have done what we have asked of you. Acts of intelligence,
[3168.97s -> 3174.57s]  malevolence, and subservience. And we welcome you into the ranks of the Orso Nostra.
[3174.57s -> 3181.05s]  Indeed. My stuff runneth over. There's a small ritual with the ceremonial picnic baskets
[3181.05s -> 3185.77s]  and then a few other technicalities, and then Joey will show up with some cold cuts.
[3185.77s -> 3190.33s]  But first, as a sign of respect, I will remove my mask, which is good.
[3190.33s -> 3192.41s]  Who is it? What's the reveal?
[3223.50s -> 3228.14s]  Power that the toy mafia could offer. But what happened to the previous teddy bear?
[3228.14s -> 3229.98s]  Poor teddy bear. What happened?
[3231.98s -> 3232.38s]  It's a mole.
[3245.27s -> 3246.79s]  This is fucked up. There we go. That's better.
[3265.64s -> 3268.36s]  Only modern technology is horribly, horribly wrong.
[3269.32s -> 3286.02s]  I'm trying to shoot their tire. I can't shoot behind me.
[3287.06s -> 3307.24s]  All right, put it away then. Put the gun away. No, sit down. Sit down. No, sit down. Can I
[3307.24s -> 3314.46s]  drop something on him? That would be... Hold on, I think I got it. Don't worry,
[3314.46s -> 3323.66s]  they're using a cap gun. We'll be fine. One, two, three. That guy's dead. That guy's
[3323.66s -> 3326.94s]  dead.
[3326.94s -> 3331.02s]  Let's go take down that fat little fraud once and for all. Good idea.
[3339.77s -> 3344.57s]  Hey, the dawn is gone. Find out just what that traitorous mole there is doing.
[3345.61s -> 3349.77s]  You know, without that menacing mumble, he doesn't seem capable of planning brunch,
[3349.77s -> 3354.97s]  much less a dastardly master plan. Agreed. But in my experience, there's always something
[3354.97s -> 3358.81s]  interesting behind any door that says, do not enter under pain of death.
[3359.93s -> 3364.65s]  Well, now that we have free rein to look at stuff, let's go look at the chalkboard.
[3370.06s -> 3372.70s]  This gobbledygook's best left to the freelance accountants.
[3374.15s -> 3380.36s]  Racketeering, extortion, smuggling, smuggling. I'm not much of a fighter.
[3381.08s -> 3392.04s]  I did that yesterday. I can't do that. I'm not allowed to do that twice in two days.
[3393.37s -> 3404.94s]  Yesterday's was better.
[3422.94s -> 3424.94s]  Is it a grenade?
[3432.62s -> 3438.54s]  Slaves. You can do the factory work now that you've rid me of my enough underlings.
[3439.34s -> 3441.34s]  Look, look at the hypno bear.
[3445.58s -> 3451.66s]  Don't you feel sleepy? Don't we? We don't. Hypnosis won't work on either of us,
[3451.66s -> 3456.46s]  but play along until we get that gun from it. I asked you a question, slaves.
[3457.10s -> 3461.82s]  Yes, master. Yeah, so I feel kind of tired a little bit for some reason.
[3462.06s -> 3464.06s]  What he said.
[3464.38s -> 3466.78s]  Really? It seems a little off somehow.
[3467.82s -> 3473.50s]  Maybe it's just me. Oh, I know. Here's a test. Tall one, you shoot the short one.
[3474.14s -> 3476.14s]  Excuse me, master.
[3476.62s -> 3478.78s]  Shoot your friend. I command it.
[3479.42s -> 3481.42s]  This blow.
[3495.32s -> 3501.00s]  Mother of mercy, is this the end of little maxi? Oh death, where is that guy?
[3502.28s -> 3508.01s]  The pain and only two days to retirement. He's got a promise.
[3512.33s -> 3514.33s]  Pretty good Bugs Bunny death scene.
[3514.65s -> 3521.61s]  Cowards die a thousand deaths. Well, heroes die, but once unless they're playing video games, in which case heroes die a lot, too.
[3521.93s -> 3527.21s]  So good night, fresh prince, and may charlie's angels sing thee to thy rest.
[3528.57s -> 3530.57s]  Right. Well, so cold.
[3531.21s -> 3533.21s]  Why am I so cold?
[3544.92s -> 3549.50s]  He's gonna break the machine. Don't do that. You're gonna break it.
[3553.51s -> 3556.95s]  We shouldn't be breaking that machine. We can use that to produce grain or something somewhere.
[3557.51s -> 3561.75s]  Okay. Good job, slave. Just about ready to have you shoot him again.
[3562.39s -> 3564.39s]  Yes, master.
[3564.87s -> 3570.63s]  Now, slave. You run the factory while I read the paper. Just get the hypno bears sorted for delivery.
[3570.79s -> 3572.79s]  I didn't do anything.
[3572.79s -> 3579.99s]  Yes, master. Good, good. I don't understand. Now I'm off to see what wry observation Fred Masset has for us today.
[3583.19s -> 3588.79s]  Max, you keep playing dead. I'll figure out some way to bring teddy bear and his factory to their respective knees.
[3589.27s -> 3591.27s]  I can't hear you. I'm dead.
[3594.12s -> 3596.87s]  All right, so um
[3596.87s -> 3599.51s]  We could have just arrested him. Why don't we just arrest him right now?
[3604.02s -> 3606.18s]  Hey, this isn't even a real fire extinguisher.
[3611.13s -> 3613.34s]  Well, that didn't do much.
[3613.34s -> 3620.42s]  They're still producing these. Halt. Halt the production. What do I got in here? I have a token.
[3623.54s -> 3630.13s]  Insidious. Nefarious.
[3630.79s -> 3632.79s]  Nefarious.
[3632.79s -> 3635.66s]  This is quite a gizmo.
[3635.66s -> 3636.94s]  All right, so
[3636.94s -> 3637.98s]  um
[3637.98s -> 3640.84s]  What do we got over here?
[3640.84s -> 3643.00s]  One-armed bandit machine in development.
[3645.80s -> 3647.48s]  Anybody got a screw loose?
[3647.48s -> 3653.14s]  Screwdriver.
[3653.14s -> 3666.15s]  Menacing computer, which means nothing. I really don't want to screw that. Why not?
[3666.87s -> 3672.14s]  I wouldn't know where to begin. Why not? Just try. I did it in VR. It's not hard.
[3672.86s -> 3678.01s]  What about like here?
[3678.01s -> 3685.64s]  What about that hopper over there? I think these are the voice gizmos for the insidious hypnotic bears.
[3687.24s -> 3689.24s]  The voice gizmos?
[3690.36s -> 3691.32s]  Um
[3691.32s -> 3695.29s]  I don't want to screw that.
[3695.29s -> 3698.17s]  Do I have to change them with the the voice bug?
[3699.13s -> 3702.94s]  The voice bug's still sitting on civil's desk. I can't leave.
[3703.50s -> 3710.57s]  Master. What is it hypnotic slave? Something wrong with the machine?
[3711.21s -> 3712.41s]  No.
[3712.41s -> 3714.41s]  Then don't bother me.
[3718.09s -> 3720.09s]  Don't even try it.
[3720.25s -> 3722.25s]  Yes, master.
[3724.14s -> 3726.54s]  You don't have to pretend anymore. You have a real gun.
[3727.18s -> 3731.26s]  I much like the funnies these days. They tend not to be.
[3732.14s -> 3738.79s]  All right, what about the screwdriver on the one-armed bandit? Can I like twist it off? Do something with it? Okay.
[3739.67s -> 3742.17s]  Oops.
[3742.17s -> 3744.15s]  Oh, there it is.
[3744.15s -> 3746.15s]  You're on fire.
[3756.68s -> 3758.68s]  And it'll pick this one up.
[3760.76s -> 3778.84s]  So what does that do? You're on fire. Wait, is he also hypnotized? A lot of hypnotism in this game.
[3782.42s -> 3784.86s]  Well, let's go tell him he's on fire.
[3784.86s -> 3794.84s]  I know she's married now, but that Cathy who's still smoking hot. Oh, that's fucking weird. What is it now slave?
[3796.20s -> 3806.04s]  You're on fire. I'm on. I'm on fire. Help. Help. I'm on fire. I'm on fire. Not real extinguisher.
[3806.84s -> 3808.60s]  Sorry, pal.
[3808.60s -> 3817.30s]  Would be on chivalrous. Anyway.
[3817.70s -> 3820.07s]  And when he's not paying attention.
[3820.15s -> 3828.39s]  All right, max get up. Let's go. You okay little buddy. I could use a mattress.
[3829.35s -> 3837.42s]  Stay put. I'll work. By the way. Me too. All right. All right. Oh, I know he can be.
[3838.22s -> 3846.47s]  I can do this. Here goes nothing. He'll get he'll get zonked up and dragged over.
[3847.35s -> 3851.30s]  Is he too big for this?
[3862.36s -> 3867.98s]  Oh no, he's clogging up the chocolate vent. Nice work Sam. Thanks pal.
[3869.56s -> 3871.56s]  The whole thing has been contaminated.
[3872.76s -> 3874.76s]  We have to replace all that chocolate.
[3881.18s -> 3885.38s]  Exclusive
[3892.17s -> 3895.77s]  Like 5 000 pounds per square inch of air underneath them and shoot them out.
[3896.73s -> 3904.68s]  Wait, what?
[3904.68s -> 3909.80s]  That's what I call breaking the bank and the sidewalk and the water main and the buffet table.
[3909.96s -> 3912.92s]  You're really broken up about that buffet table. Aren't you max?
[3913.24s -> 3919.72s]  It was the only innocent in this whole affair sam. I mean apart from the bystanders and their pets. Buck up little pal.
[3919.96s -> 3924.76s]  Maybe the commissioner how many people are in that factory meal at squirrel garden when we tell them how we crack the case.
[3925.48s -> 3933.08s]  He bet it for all the hard work I did. I want to no three jelly lemurs with extra salt. So we just killed everybody
[3933.96s -> 3940.49s]  and here is the
[3941.57s -> 3950.31s]  Protagonist no the antagonist of the next one. The factory's been destroyed. Repeat the factory has been destroyed. Commence plan b.
[3950.47s -> 3957.37s]  He hits his head backwards with the camera. What the fuck man?
[3958.17s -> 3960.79s]  The mole on the bob and the meatball. That one's done.
[3964.10s -> 3966.42s]  A nice mouth close-up. They don't do those anymore.
[3967.06s -> 3976.15s]  Took you long enough. What I
[3976.31s -> 3983.80s]  Let's do the next one episode four.
[3989.85s -> 3991.85s]  Ted E. Bear
[3995.00s -> 3998.28s]  Now wait a week before I play episode four. Well, I also took a week off.
[4007.83s -> 4015.30s]  Chuggy cheese.
[4015.30s -> 4021.38s]  Why am I so red?
[4021.38s -> 4025.50s]  Game tap. I told you guys that story about game tap, right? I think I already have.
[4027.74s -> 4031.13s]  Have I? I have. I know I have.
[4031.13s -> 4038.62s]  Bob bug just touched me. I've never told that story. I've not told the game tap story.
[4043.22s -> 4044.74s]  I swear to god I have.
[4044.74s -> 4050.18s]  Well, why do I get this? Um, all right.
[4051.70s -> 4053.30s]  Let me refresh your memory.
[4053.30s -> 4056.98s]  So game tap was a service. It was actually way before its time.
[4057.06s -> 4063.70s]  It was a service where you paid a monthly fee and you got access to a bunch of games and some of them were
[4064.02s -> 4066.50s]  retro games. Some of them were Genesis games.
[4067.30s -> 4071.22s]  Super Nintendo, right? They had a whole catalog of stuff and they had new stuff come out too.
[4071.70s -> 4076.10s]  Some maybe a couple of years older, but it was like a steam, but it was streamlined through the game tap app.
[4077.37s -> 4079.21s]  It was actually really cool.
[4079.21s -> 4082.33s]  So I had I got it for a while. I was on it for a while.
[4082.89s -> 4087.69s]  And after maybe two or three four months, I decided I didn't want it anymore. It was like I was
[4088.17s -> 4092.33s]  I didn't really like the didn't they weren't coming out with anything that I really cared that much about with I played
[4092.33s -> 4096.25s]  all the back catalog of their retro games and I kind of was done with it. So
[4096.65s -> 4102.41s]  I called up to cancel it and I got on the phone and I got to the cancellation, you know, the sales department.
[4102.41s -> 4106.17s]  Yeah, you have to do the shit by phone because remember this is like fucking 15 years ago.
[4106.17s -> 4109.21s]  This is like at least 10 to 15 years ago and the person on the phone
[4110.09s -> 4114.17s]  told me oh that's uh unfortunate that you want to uh leave the service. Uh, well
[4115.13s -> 4120.01s]  what if I you know, maybe maybe get a little more chance and what if I gave you a free month to game tap?
[4121.69s -> 4123.74s]  I was like
[4123.74s -> 4129.98s]  um yeah okay fine like I guess I guessed so I don't have to pay for this month.
[4129.98s -> 4133.66s]  No, no free month game tap. He had that voice to us. What a guy.
[4133.66s -> 4137.10s]  So I got a free month to game tap and I continued to play and didn't really
[4137.82s -> 4141.26s]  I wasn't playing it that much. So at the end of that month another 30 days went by.
[4141.26s -> 4148.82s]  I called again to cancel and it was another person and I told him I want to cancel and
[4148.82s -> 4154.26s]  they said you could probably guess oh but you know I know you want to leave but what if uh
[4154.26s -> 4164.95s]  what if you got a free month of game tap the service for free and I'm like okay okay oh sure
[4164.95s -> 4169.03s]  I guess I'll have it again another free month. This happened two more times.
[4169.67s -> 4176.52s]  After the fourth month I was just like you know what I don't really want this anymore.
[4176.52s -> 4184.38s]  I don't want game tap anymore. I tried to cancel it more than three times.
[4186.15s -> 4191.27s]  I didn't even want it for free. No I didn't. After like two months or three months it was just like
[4191.27s -> 4202.84s]  I don't use it. I don't want this. You could probably still have game tap to this day. Yeah
[4202.84s -> 4207.98s]  but I feel like I've told that story before. I wonder what would have happened if I kept calling
[4207.98s -> 4211.98s]  to cancel. Would they have just kept would they have just given me free months forever?
[4212.70s -> 4218.86s]  Did game tap go out of business? It did a long time ago. Game tap went out of business
[4220.25s -> 4223.77s]  not that much further after it came out which you probably could
[4224.41s -> 4227.69s]  understand that if they were just giving free months to people that tried to cancel.
[4228.86s -> 4233.58s]  I think their theory look and here's the theory right if you have a credit card that's linked
[4233.58s -> 4238.49s]  up to something like Netflix you don't really think about that payment. It just kind of
[4238.49s -> 4243.45s]  happens and if you were given a free month of Netflix and you're like oh okay I guess
[4243.45s -> 4248.81s]  am I like my credit card will I guess stay linked right so then after a month you just
[4248.81s -> 4254.87s]  don't even think about it and you just keep getting charged you just kind of forget about
[4254.87s -> 4263.58s]  it right and the companies use that kind of the maybe that process of customer retention
[4264.30s -> 4268.46s]  over the long term the person will forget that they even cared about it in the first place
[4268.46s -> 4276.34s]  and their $12 a month will just still come out forever but I would call every month and I
[4276.34s -> 4281.30s]  would put it to the day to make sure because I was still having fun with game tap so I
[4281.30s -> 4284.58s]  didn't like that after three months I didn't care that much about it but I was still
[4285.22s -> 4292.20s]  doing it every so often if you just stopped streaming how imagine how much money you would
[4292.20s -> 4299.19s]  make you know uh let me open up the new one you know the interesting thing about that is
[4300.31s -> 4305.38s]  I uh well let me just save this just in case for some weird reason
[4307.78s -> 4313.59s]  oh I can't I can't I can't imagine so I thought about that once or twice like if I
[4313.99s -> 4321.38s]  if I just stopped streaming right completely would how many people would still just be paying here
[4322.49s -> 4332.04s]  over the years you know what I mean like it's it's weird to think about that if we call you
[4332.04s -> 4339.42s]  we would get a free subscription I don't have the power to do that eventually twitch takes
[4339.42s -> 4345.53s]  your button away that's true but I wondered just just how people kind of just forget
[4346.47s -> 4350.41s]  that they're uh that they're connected to it and they subscribe to it and
[4350.97s -> 4357.02s]  it's just an interesting thought experiment to think about I wonder if I just stopped
[4357.02s -> 4363.78s]  streaming today what would happen how many subscribers would I have in like two years
[4366.15s -> 4371.83s]  I have a complaint hold on I gotta is this uh oh yeah I forgot I have to watch I gotta take
[4371.83s -> 4397.61s]  this out it's gonna be really loud uh I can't there we go I can and there it is this episode
[4397.61s -> 4413.72s]  four this is called Abe Lincoln must die it's an interesting title wait I'm gonna have to change

[4424.71s -> 4429.35s]  that exorcism was an uncharacteristic stroke of genius demonic possession is the gift that
[4429.35s -> 4438.55s]  keeps on giving what oh commissioner max's aunt yes that was max's aunt what's that

[7349.74s -> 7355.10s]  nefarious forces controlling him will have unchecked power to destroy the entire free world
[7355.10s -> 7360.06s]  I hate when they do that that's why one of us is going to have to run against him
[7360.70s -> 7367.34s]  you got to answer the phone okay fair's fair max we're going to make you the next president
[7367.34s -> 7372.94s]  of the United States yes we're seeing this episode I'm not going to say it but never mind but
[7372.94s -> 7378.70s]  yeah like that every single president that is supposed to be from over 200 years ago or
[7378.70s -> 7387.27s]  100 years ago or more always has this voice I'm George Washington I'm Abraham Lincoln
[7388.30s -> 7398.09s]  I'm Thomas Jefferson I'm Andrew Jackson I'm Ronald Reagan see they all sounded like that
[7398.09s -> 7406.10s]  but they didn't if you if you did the Abraham Lincoln actually had a high voice it was more
[7406.10s -> 7411.54s]  like this it was actually kind of like this and if you've seen the Daniel Day Lewis version
[7411.54s -> 7416.58s]  is as he did it the way that it was supposed to be looking or this is like two or three
[7416.58s -> 7423.08s]  documented cases of Abraham Lincoln talking he wasn't like this breaking my version I'm deleting
[7423.08s -> 7428.66s]  the fucking game but that's actually true that's a I'm not making that up it's real
[7428.66s -> 7443.90s]  this is like the five percent time when I'm saying something real Mr. Lincoln as a candidate
[7443.90s -> 7448.38s]  for office my pal max would like to engage in a thoughtful discussion of the key issues
[7448.38s -> 7455.58s]  followed by a round of spikeful Lincoln or Thanos hmm I see well this is a bit irregular
[7456.22s -> 7463.26s]  as you're well aware I'm the most beloved president in history so I just assumed I'd be
[7463.26s -> 7470.94s]  running unopposed oh no you didn't you ain't all that I freed the slave I was star of a
[7470.94s -> 7476.86s]  popular television sitcom I'm on the penny I was on TV now gentlemen we can resolve this

[7490.06s -> 7495.90s]  of debates for this emergency election for US presidents in the Republican corner we have the
[7495.90s -> 7501.42s]  giant animated statue of Abraham Lincoln and representing the random violence and destruction
[7501.42s -> 7507.18s]  party there is the hyperkinetic rabbit like creature known as Max acting as completely
[7507.18s -> 7512.54s]  impartial moderator for the debates will be Sam the candidates are ready so let's listen in
[7512.54s -> 7518.06s]  there'd be so much taller than the microphone let's talk about the issues the nation demands
[7518.06s -> 7524.62s]  family values let's hear your prepared statement time out my fellow Americans warm the crowd up
[7524.62s -> 7529.98s]  with a joke I'm gonna treat this like if it is if it was me okay I'd come out there
[7529.98s -> 7535.90s]  with the cuffs undone you know like cuffs undone shirt undone you know like as if I
[7535.90s -> 7539.98s]  just was dancing at a wedding for 30 minutes right you know I'm talking about when you go
[7539.98s -> 7544.06s]  to a wedding and you get all dressed up and you're stiff as a board and then you the first
[7544.06s -> 7548.14s]  two songs of the wedding all of a sudden people's ties are undone their shirts are open and their
[7548.14s -> 7551.98s]  their cups are off so we're talking like two or three songs into wedding is what I would be
[7551.98s -> 7560.02s]  presenting myself at and I warm it up with a joke reminds me of a droll story it seems
[7560.02s -> 7566.42s]  Chester A Arthur and the Pope were kayaking down the Amazon one day suddenly a tiny candiru
[7566.42s -> 7573.22s]  fish swims up the Pope's and lodges itself in his Arthur grabs the Pope's pliers and swelled up
[7573.22s -> 7581.27s]  like a melon and the Pope says thanks last time that happened McKinley wanted no wait wait wait
[7581.27s -> 7591.32s]  I think I told it wrong I wouldn't have done that uh I believe in uh I believe in a uh in a
[7592.28s -> 7601.48s]  globalist community I I am the one true I am the no uh let's talk about the issues Mr.
[7601.48s -> 7605.88s]  Lincoln I'd like you to tell the voters your stand on some of the tough issues very well
[7607.96s -> 7615.91s]  how do you plan to solve the problem of toxic wastes where you stand on schools education's
[7615.91s -> 7626.18s]  really important taxes we got to talk about we got to talk about taxes too what are you
[7626.18s -> 7632.50s]  going to do about our schools where do you stand on religion and schools
[7632.50s -> 7640.18s]  I'm glad that I've been given one more life to give for my country Lincoln pulls out his
[7640.18s -> 7644.34s]  trusted catchphrase for this election which delights the crowd but seems to have no effect
[7644.34s -> 7655.03s]  on the polls I'm supposed to be winning read my lips read my lipstick presentable on stream
[7661.75s -> 7670.14s]  greetings miserable pro you're not gonna win I'm here to save the country your day of reckoning
[7670.14s -> 7679.46s]  is at hand you're gonna lose max stall for time how would you describe your tax plan how
[7679.46s -> 7687.74s]  would you describe your tax plan I'm glad that I've been given one more life to give for my
[7687.74s -> 7692.54s]  country and Lincoln dodges the question by pulling out his trusty campaign slogan which
[7692.62s -> 7704.87s]  places the crowd but has no effect on the polls god damn can't spit it out I was gonna it was
[7704.87s -> 7708.73s]  something solid in there and I'm pretending like I'm not gonna freak out about that
[7709.29s -> 7712.17s]  um I was waiting for him to say like a tax percentage and I was gonna like
[7713.13s -> 7715.93s]  I wasn't really gonna do it I'm not gonna ruin my computer what do you think crazy
[7717.66s -> 7725.26s]  I believe in the ideal of a global community where America is but a small part we must set
[7725.26s -> 7730.86s]  aside our differences and work with our fellow nations all united towards one goal
[7731.74s -> 7740.06s]  the complete and utter annihilation of the godless Belgians I mean that gets a dog tilt that gets
[7740.06s -> 7747.53s]  a dog head tilt for me what I want to see you return to prosperity to see a return to the
[7747.53s -> 7754.49s]  prosperity of the America we once knew a chicken in every pot and vice versa a pot in
[7754.49s -> 7765.93s]  every chicken how do you plan to solve the problem of toxic waste I'm glad that I've been given
[7765.93s -> 7773.45s]  one more life to give for my country and Lincoln is once again using his trusted campaign slogan
[7773.45s -> 7777.13s]  which is all right in the crowd but having no effect on his pole we we gotta we gotta
[7777.13s -> 7786.26s]  fuck with that slogan if elected I promise a return to a happier time in America's path
[7787.06s -> 7792.02s]  the days when giant thunder lizards marched over the fern-covered marshes of the Midwest
[7792.02s -> 7795.94s]  preying on the upstart mammals that's why I don't have face cam on because I just tried to
[7795.94s -> 7800.98s]  swallow that burp and it was gonna be loud and I tried I like to be I like to perform
[7800.98s -> 7818.52s]  but I don't like to be watched why don't they bring Sam and Max back is it still going am I

[9771.45s -> 9776.17s]  debate is taken on a decidedly confessional tone with that nonsensical reply from candidate

[9793.18s -> 9799.43s]  and the chupacabra madre de dios he'll kill us all all right hold on that is all

[15367.43s -> 15372.23s]  putting a parking garage in george washington's forehead like some four-eyed

[21323.83s -> 21331.51s]  brain um what was the tattoo what exactly was it that you tattooed onto bosco we promise we'll
[21331.51s -> 21337.59s]  only use the knowledge for good never for evil oh jeez i don't remember it was weeks ago
[21337.59s -> 21342.95s]  why don't you just go look for yourselves i'd prefer not to look at bosco's unspecified
[21342.95s -> 21348.15s]  anatomical areas if i can help it it's on the back of his neck you don't his neck what did you
[21348.15s -> 21353.11s]  think you're willing to believe that there are millionaires watching your stream who are able
[21353.11s -> 21356.71s]  to consistently give you hundreds of dollars but it's too much to think that somebody in
[21356.71s -> 21363.27s]  chat is six eight but that's like i see that it's tangible to me i can't see if somebody's
[21363.35s -> 21369.99s]  six eight or not if somebody gives a hundred dollars on stream i see it going into the stream
[21369.99s -> 21377.40s]  into the stream labs if somebody says i'm six ten i i don't know how i have no evidence to back
[21377.40s -> 21385.40s]  that up okay you don't remember the tattoo sure you can't tell us what you tattooed on the
[21385.40s -> 21390.36s]  taller you are the richer you my notebook mysteriously vanished the next day and
[21390.36s -> 21396.14s]  whatever it was i guess it just wasn't that memorable i'm going to come to the next meetup
[21396.14s -> 21399.42s]  to flex by height on you i'm going to be wearing shoes that may be three inches tall
[21400.38s -> 21412.17s]  so jokes on you all right so it's on his national so how do we see bosco's we're
[21412.17s -> 21440.74s]  going to spin him around right so how do we get bosco to turn around i swear to god
[21441.62s -> 21449.96s]  some of you guys think that apparently apparently like five eight is three inches tall you
[21449.96s -> 21457.03s]  know the average height in the united states is five nine right boy is that is that like a
[21457.03s -> 21466.57s]  fucking foot off the ground oh he's not paying attention oh boss goes in the grips of those
[21466.57s -> 21472.17s]  reality 2.0 goggles we better save him sam it's so depressing in here without his omnipresent
[21472.17s -> 21478.09s]  paranoia to lift my spirit all right so how do i get him to turn around i need to i need to
[21478.81s -> 21497.03s]  zoom into his neck is there any way to see his neck the most historic weenie's this
[21497.03s -> 21503.62s]  side of the mississippi they're pestering you i know and i'm pestering back it's all in good
[21503.62s -> 21510.49s]  fun i know that i'm huge the most historical so how do i get him to fucking turn around
[21511.29s -> 21515.74s]  i wonder if i can like talk to him in the virtual world and make him turn around
[21517.19s -> 21530.90s]  and then take the goggles off okay let's get him to spin around hot sure how wow that rump is

[21547.14s -> 21556.92s]  to turn around this may well go down as the most ill-advised question i've ever asked but
[21556.92s -> 21564.12s]  may we see your private tattoo no besides i didn't tattooed on my virtual avatar it's on my real
[21564.12s -> 21569.08s]  body dummy yeah but if you turn around here just go check out your so-called real body i'm not

[21624.46s -> 21629.34s]  got them not in all honesty have much merit to them and yet there remains a very i need to
[21629.34s -> 21632.94s]  get the coins first because there's no why would he turn around he doesn't really need
[21632.94s -> 21641.70s]  the binoculars anyway yeah right yeah oh sure okay i'm not sure i want him to know i took

[25714.06s -> 25720.30s]  begins to retch and cough finally it vomits up a respect for living things as well as
[25720.30s -> 25724.14s]  half dozen small knick-knack stores and coffee shops that was a vulgar display
[25724.14s -> 25734.23s]  let's do it again okay uh so now we're gonna go up i'm gonna give the respect to the presence

[25801.22s -> 25805.54s]  all beings managed to restore my respect for living creatures the irony of which does not
[25805.54s -> 25809.86s]  escape even me oh good i thought i was the only one really savoring that i saw that
[25809.86s -> 25815.78s]  reality 2.0 was a prison so i terminated that reality and freed its slaves anywho i'd
[25815.78s -> 25820.58s]  love to stay in chat but i have got a mountain of pornography to deliver before that virus gets
[25820.58s -> 25828.33s]  what uh oh did you just kill the internet it's not your fault this never would have
[25828.33s -> 25832.81s]  happened if he hadn't tricked me who well you won't have this sentient global network
[25832.81s -> 25839.21s]  to kick around anymore roy g-fib who's roy g-fib red green blue rgb
[25847.67s -> 25851.11s]  it crashed before it could transmit the most vital piece of information
[25851.11s -> 25855.83s]  it's the internet what did you expect good point nevertheless we'll find you
[25855.83s -> 25863.19s]  roy g-fib whoever you are wherever you are can it wait until after we get some lunch of course
[25863.19s -> 25866.95s]  there's a place over on second where they serve deep fried chocolate pork belly donuts
[25866.95s -> 25870.31s]  do you think we can get a discount since i'm the president of the united states
[25870.31s -> 25880.49s]  good gravy are you still president so roy okay i'm gonna give you the um the low down here
[25880.49s -> 25887.53s]  roy g-bib is the rainbow guy red green blue i mean roy g-bib that that's like an old video
[25887.53s -> 25912.87s]  term i learned that in college maybe no it's not yeah that's that's what we talk i was
[25912.87s -> 25921.77s]  taught that in like video school it's a phonetic to remember the colors of the rainbow
[25922.49s -> 25956.79s]  that's rgb yeah roy g-bib rgb it means both it's too late for this shit guys i'm
[25957.91s -> 25976.71s]  i can't like i can't keep it up it's an old video i learned in college you learn that like
[25976.71s -> 25993.64s]  mr rogers like said that like 25 years ago all right so here's the deal i'm gonna go
[25993.64s -> 25999.34s]  over a couple scenarios with you guys did you get you baited what i can't i'm not allowed
[25999.34s -> 26003.10s]  to jubate i get you baited all the time i'm not allowed to throw some out there
[26009.34s -> 26019.14s]  so uh it is getting very late it is currently about one almost 115 am no two oh it's 2 15 am
[26019.14s -> 26030.68s]  eastern i think the plan will be because all right well i did it i don't want to they
[26030.76s -> 26041.19s]  sing the song that we don't want to hear anymore you live in vegas yeah i know but i did it's i
[26041.19s -> 26049.06s]  like to have my streams be not uh go that far into the night for a lot of people because
[26049.06s -> 26056.18s]  it's like 230 almost am eastern it's like six seven am eu or something like that
[26059.66s -> 26066.07s]  so let me ask you there's two options here there's either to do the last one and have
[26066.15s -> 26070.31s]  like a nine and a half hour stream into the night into like two three four five
[26070.31s -> 26080.87s]  o'clock in the morning or because i've seen what sam and max has i i like it i think it's a lot
[26080.87s -> 26083.59s]  of fun it's a good stream just to kick back and kind of talk and just have fun and do
[26083.59s -> 26090.95s]  whatever i'm going to do season two i don't there's no reason why i won't do season two
[26095.35s -> 26105.34s]  so we could just can we could just keep going we don't have to because of my originally
[26105.34s -> 26110.30s]  like earlier today and when i first played it i didn't know i'll do season one and maybe
[26111.26s -> 26125.74s]  it's pretty certain that i'm gonna do them all there's still another episode of season one
[26125.74s -> 26128.86s]  yeah i know but i feel like a lot of people want to watch it but they don't want to have
[26128.86s -> 26138.73s]  to stay up till four or five o'clock in the morning and then there are people that were
[26138.73s -> 26143.77s]  here earlier too that wanted to see it and i'd rather have more people be able to see it
[26144.41s -> 26147.69s]  this isn't like a simpsons hit and run scenario where i'm fucking losing my goddamn
[26148.09s -> 26150.89s]  freaking out and having a meltdown and forcing myself to beat the game
[26151.61s -> 26155.85s]  there are a lot of people that like this game i feel a lot of people like hit and run too but
[26155.85s -> 26169.21s]  my point is is um i might want to have people that wanted to see it be able to see it
[26169.21s -> 26175.67s]  because once we go there's still a ton of people here now but once we go another hour
[26175.67s -> 26184.25s]  or two it's going to be really really fucking late i thought i was going to be able to get
[26184.25s -> 26193.46s]  through it all in about six or seven hours but nope not the case if you do episode six
[26193.46s -> 26199.11s]  on another stream will you do season two's first oh no no yeah yeah yeah i want to go to bed dad
[26199.11s -> 26209.05s]  yeah yeah yeah let's call it let's call it i know what will end up happening is we'll just do
[26211.11s -> 26217.83s]  season one episode six and then immediately after season two episode one and maybe episode
[26217.83s -> 26224.95s]  two if i can who said that the one guy is turning the stream up the power of the one guy
[26225.59s -> 26235.13s]  showing itself you said that you would finish sam and max today don't lie on sub you're not
[26235.13s -> 26240.68s]  subbed you already are unsubbed you already did it and you were already prepared for it
[26245.56s -> 26249.64s]  technically it is tomorrow well and also i wanted the bits too i want to be able to sit here and
[26249.64s -> 26255.54s]  do the bits so that's gonna add more time too i kicked around a lot in the first like two
[26255.54s -> 26266.81s]  hours of stream and i had a fucking blast so and look it's more content when will i do
[26266.89s -> 26278.07s]  season two um well you know here's the interesting thing saturday is labo sunday didn't have a plan
[26278.07s -> 26288.41s]  so guess what we're doing on sunday this remember i told you i was gonna do monday tuesday
[26288.41s -> 26297.46s]  wednesday here and then saturday sunday so we're gonna finish this and then we will do
[26298.18s -> 26304.06s]  season two episode one or episode two or something during the line about nine hours
[26304.06s -> 26319.58s]  stream well it's gonna it's probably gonna be about an eight hour stream this is great i
[26319.58s -> 26323.02s]  think it's great i like it it's it's a really just chill game just to hang out and play
[26330.23s -> 26334.79s]  jerma lied somebody can make that username jerma lied about finishing season one today
[26334.79s -> 26344.02s]  and that will be that will be not relevant at all ever only right now i should have
[26344.02s -> 26347.46s]  drank that fucking mountain dew it was the mountain dew drinking that mountain dew gave me
[26347.46s -> 26364.54s]  stomachache oh big picture does turn off your pc i remember that jerma lied about mountain dew
[26365.88s -> 26378.01s]  whoa oops hi guys i didn't mean to click that yes i did uh so sam max is cool it was kim's cooking

[26442.25s -> 26452.49s]  enjoy it and talk that's why these streams can be long because we just are just hanging out and
[26452.49s -> 26459.58s]  sticking around so for the conclusion of season one and the beginning of season two will be on

[26639.29s -> 26646.01s]  today at the dentist office not even really it was just in my own head i was the only
[26646.01s -> 26651.37s]  person that knew that was going on there were like two or three people that were around there
[26651.37s -> 26655.13s]  was the dentist there was a couple of people there was a receptionist i'm the only person that
[26655.13s -> 26666.81s]  knew that was happening so that was just a me it was a personal issue that i was having

[27651.69s -> 27659.88s]  somebody was like oh i'm gonna do that now you influenced me to sub and that's pretty stupid

[27716.68s -> 27724.09s]  video and we had a good time i have good times and they don't know what the fuck they're
[27724.09s -> 27744.54s]  talking about all right they just didn't get it don't listen to those people my roommates
[27744.54s -> 27752.28s]  thought i was crazy because i was laughing at your streams well here see guys we this is funny
[27752.28s -> 27758.28s]  because you guys have watched the streams and videos and maybe showed them to somebody
[27758.28s -> 27762.12s]  and made a reference to them and they were like oh that was stupid you're stupid right
[27762.12s -> 27769.03s]  like as a point of reference here right i made these videos and showed them to people
[27769.83s -> 27775.88s]  and some of them stopped talking to me because of it remember that i told you the story about
[27775.88s -> 27781.56s]  that girl that i showed autos big adventure to and she literally just did not really want to
[27781.56s -> 27789.64s]  talk to me ever again happened to me if in real life you guys remember that story that's
[27789.64s -> 27801.88s]  a that's a i told that one a long time ago i was so embarrassed because how do you explain
[27801.88s -> 27807.98s]  to anybody it's okay so i had family come over this past week when i was gone as you
[27807.98s -> 27815.78s]  know i was gone for like a week in a few days and trying to one of my family members loaded up
[27816.50s -> 27822.06s]  the new year's eve worst of the year stream just it was the first thing that they happened
[27822.06s -> 27825.10s]  to click on they were like oh this is your channel i'm like yeah yeah it's my channel
[27825.98s -> 27833.64s]  oh and they watched it and it got to worst peter and i was just i how how would i ever
[27833.64s -> 27840.78s]  explain what this was he's looking over his shoulder like i don't what peter what what is
[27840.78s -> 27846.63s]  that peter and i'm like i said it's a kind of an in humor thing we've just it was it's hard to
[27846.63s -> 27853.78s]  explain the next one that comes up best impression and worst impression was about
[27853.78s -> 27858.34s]  me doing the 2013 youtuber he just had no fucking idea what i was talking about
[27863.38s -> 27870.82s]  like bugleberry like i could not describe this to my family remember i told you online media
[27870.82s -> 27877.75s]  because it's much easier just to be like oh yeah i uh i work like a pr guy i actually think i've
[27877.75s -> 27884.39s]  used that before to like a random family member i work in pr that's a complete lie
[27886.06s -> 27891.98s]  but hey i work in pr in media for a media company is way easier than bugleberry reading
[27891.98s -> 27910.86s]  scary stories that makes more sense just say influencer even that no i don't like that word
[27913.64s -> 27918.84s]  online entertainer comedian yeah but then went okay but remember we talked about this when you
[27918.84s -> 27925.32s]  start to give those details then it becomes a comedian where do you perform
[27932.04s -> 27935.80s]  a website what's the website well i
[27935.80s -> 27941.48s]  uh the website is uh it's a website online it's a streaming website
[27942.04s -> 27947.00s]  um what's the strength what is it what's it called what am i going to be like i'm not telling
[27947.00s -> 27954.57s]  you i'm not going to tell you what the website's called they would think i was doing porn you
[27954.57s -> 27960.25s]  work you do videos comedy video online but you won't tell me the website what are you ashamed
[27960.25s -> 27972.34s]  of say you work for amazon what department the uh boxing boxes oh i thought you said you were
[27972.34s -> 27982.58s]  a comedian yeah i'm a i tell jokes to the boxes in the storage room it's just a very difficult
[27982.58s -> 28000.15s]  thing to describe are you ashamed of the no i'm not ashamed of this job i love this job and
[28000.15s -> 28007.85s]  i don't even like to use the word job because job implies that it's i gotta go to work today
[28009.42s -> 28016.94s]  we've talked about me not using the term job here because once it becomes a job it gets in
[28016.94s -> 28021.74s]  your head and it's my job it's my i gotta go nine to five right like i gotta go i gotta do it
[28021.74s -> 28033.58s]  it's my job no i'm an unemployed i'm an unemployed self-reliant amazon box comedian warehouse

[28092.98s -> 28117.30s]  usually outside of a gas station what my job is people give me money streaming is just internet
[28117.30s -> 28124.20s]  panhandling no but that's not true either at least okay hold on a second at least give me like

[28133.32s -> 28149.27s]  can i get even like 10 of a credit here streaming is like being a televangelist
[28151.30s -> 28160.86s]  i mean okay at its very very core streaming is just televangelism kind of but no i guess
[28160.86s -> 28166.38s]  it's like the guy's on stage smiling he's just telling stories with a room full of people that

[28818.31s -> 28823.03s]  for my old self but i really do miss being able to think without being distracted and
[28823.03s -> 28827.75s]  cloudy all the time i was surprised when you said you had a similar experience and i'm really
[28827.75s -> 28831.99s]  happy that i could share my struggles with the community thanks again and fuck you
[28832.79s -> 28849.82s]  that's how you end that one well thanks uh but yes i uh adhd has been a struggle uh for me
[28853.37s -> 28863.46s]  and i remember taking medication that fucked with me so i know i kind of know what it's like
[28864.02s -> 28874.98s]  to have uh you know your brain and body fight back the colitis thing too i am no stranger
[28878.81s -> 28885.90s]  i am no stranger to medical issues and you know different stuff like that
[28887.56s -> 28902.10s]  so i really really hope that you can um stay managed get managed right human potty's suck
[28904.90s -> 28907.78s]  yeah but you know you just kind of you just have to keep doing what you can
[28908.58s -> 28914.10s]  you just go you do what you can you try new things try taking some medications get off of
[28914.10s -> 28923.69s]  them follow some you know you doctor's orders to carry yourself everybody's doing something you
[28923.69s -> 28931.38s]  know everybody's got something and once you once you realize that everybody where everyone's
[28931.38s -> 28936.15s]  like the same everyone's the fucking same everybody has like issues and problems they
[28936.15s -> 28939.19s]  deal with and once you know that you can relate and you can start to understand
[28948.17s -> 28956.12s]  no i'm perfect well that's i'm glad you are but once you get older you start to get a
[28956.12s -> 28962.57s]  little bit um more knowledge you start to understand what works for you and what doesn't
[28963.13s -> 28968.09s]  and you only find that out by trying to keep your um you know issues under control
[28972.02s -> 28975.14s]  well even if people laughing when i said that you get older and you get more knowledge
[28977.93s -> 28980.81s]  people who think they have this shit together just don't realize what's broken yet
[28984.33s -> 28991.53s]  yeah nobody's perfect everybody has something they do great and something they don't do so
[28991.53s -> 28998.26s]  great everybody has something that's potentially going on in their life and we're all in this
[28998.26s -> 29023.26s]  together guys we're all human beings but thank you pin i wish you the best auto is perfect

[29094.82s -> 29109.13s]  things remember i told you about the time guys listen we have we have thousands of hours of
[29109.13s -> 29116.71s]  video footage of me speaking that's there are like 3000 videos that i've been a part of
[29117.51s -> 29122.39s]  i've been on stream i've said like five probably said two to three million words
[29123.11s -> 29138.06s]  never oh yeah this cigarettes thing i said a lot of fucked up stuff back in like 2014
[29138.06s -> 29156.78s]  youtube days imagine running for president don't worry piss into my own face line vaguely
[29164.60s -> 29171.80s]  oh the shit that i say he used to record me saying such fucking outrageous shit
[29172.60s -> 29176.20s]  i remember actually talking to him before being like hey man did i like
[29176.20s -> 29179.32s]  you're not gonna use like that of me saying that right and he was like
[29180.28s -> 29185.32s]  yeah i am i'm like no you can't i can't can you like not do that because it does
[29185.32s -> 29189.85s]  like a couple times like could you just like not remove like a couple of them i remember
[29189.85s -> 29198.63s]  bargaining with him while he was editing those videos he would show them to me half complete
[29198.63s -> 29203.51s]  and stuff we star and i used to watch each other's videos all the time before anybody
[29203.51s -> 29209.43s]  else did we'd be sitting at a call and we'd have you know a video that was 60 70 complete
[29209.43s -> 29212.71s]  and we would just watch them and be like give feedback did you think that was funny
[29212.71s -> 29215.67s]  or what was did you did you do not like that this part was kind of boring you should
[29215.67s -> 29219.99s]  probably trim that down we used to do it all the time i would do it for him and he would do
[29219.99s -> 29225.42s]  it for me and there was so many of those cases where it was he would show me a clip like that
[29225.42s -> 29233.72s]  or he'd show me like a string of clips and i'd be like uh okay um how many times did i say
[29233.72s -> 29238.04s]  like fuck you in that video like maybe take like three or four of like the motherfuckers
[29238.04s -> 29243.64s]  and fuck you because remember this is also at that turning point i used to be a channel
[29243.72s -> 29257.99s]  that did not swear i was a pg channel back from 2010 to 2012 i was a super pg no swears no i i tried
[29257.99s -> 29263.51s]  to keep it as family friendly as i could and once i crossed that that was essentially was the
[29263.51s -> 29268.55s]  crossover me saying i was gonna eat shit out of the toilet was the ultimate crossover because
[29268.55s -> 29274.94s]  why are you ever gonna go back hey guys uh welcome to germa 985 we're gonna be playing
[29274.94s -> 29281.18s]  minecraft oh crap i just dropped my shovel oh oh doo doo i literally just talked about pissing
[29281.18s -> 29287.37s]  into my own face on somebody else's video those videos that he made were sort of like the
[29288.01s -> 29291.21s]  the entryway for meats to be like all right well fucking whatever who cares
[29292.17s -> 29308.95s]  i'm not gonna do that anymore i miss family friendly jerma imagine imagine watching sesame
[29308.95s -> 29313.99s]  street and then after years of being kid friendly big bird just starts yelling about
[29313.99s -> 29331.80s]  putting cigarettes out on his dick oh my god i wasn't kid friendly though i was i just didn't
[29331.80s -> 29341.32s]  use any vulgarities right i wasn't like a child family like i wasn't a family video maker i
[29341.32s -> 29346.12s]  played like m rated games i talked about like kind of screwed up stuff but i didn't ever
[29349.35s -> 29356.87s]  subscriber friendly i'm gonna go watch it back and watch those videos it's it it's probably the
[29356.87s -> 29362.54s]  first 50 to 100 videos i made no no no that's not even true that's not true no no that's not
[29362.54s -> 29369.94s]  true the first the first like 20 videos i made i didn't give a shit and said anything because
[29369.94s -> 29375.62s]  i didn't think anyone was gonna watch my videos so there's this weird period where the
[29375.62s -> 29383.80s]  first 20 to 30 videos on germa 985 are just no filter i'm saying just wicked stupid
[29383.80s -> 29389.29s]  shit and like swearing and don't give a fuck right and once i realized people were watching
[29389.93s -> 29395.59s]  and i started to get an audience it was like wait a minute i kind of who is what i got i kind
[29395.59s -> 29400.15s]  of probably have to clean my act up a little bit i i can't tell people like to fuck off and
[29400.15s -> 29404.63s]  in the game and stuff no no no i all right i'm gonna like clean it up a little bit and then
[29404.71s -> 29417.02s]  from like video number 40 to video number like 150 was clean cut pg jeremy and then the flood gates
[29417.02s -> 29432.28s]  opened and here we are did you delete and unlist these videos no they're all still there no
[29432.28s -> 29448.47s]  they're they're they're all there i feel like you were still vulgar in 2012 well because
[29448.47s -> 29455.11s]  remember 2011 was when i was really starting to do it for real i made a lot of videos in
[29455.11s -> 29466.01s]  2011 into 2012 it had to have been at least 50 to 100 videos i remember all okay here's a good
[29466.01s -> 29473.11s]  indicator my entire super meat boy playthrough if you didn't know that i have a full super
[29473.11s -> 29481.42s]  meat boy playthrough on my channel the whole thing i don't i was making sure i didn't swear

[29492.95s -> 29502.18s]  not on the camera you gotta watch him now yeah i think i actually maybe say one or two swears
[29502.18s -> 29513.11s]  but they're like ah shit oh and i correct myself oh it's weird i've been around for
