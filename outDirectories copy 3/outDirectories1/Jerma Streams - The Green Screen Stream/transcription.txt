[9.78s -> 11.78s]  I want to know how bad this microphone is.
[14.28s -> 16.28s]  Am I coming out like one side of your ear?
[22.70s -> 25.42s]  It sounds great. Well, it's about to sound probably way worse.
[29.24s -> 32.73s]  You got atmosphere.
[32.73s -> 34.49s]  That's what you got with me.
[34.49s -> 39.48s]  You know, I was going to do like this.
[39.48s -> 41.00s]  Camera's not working.
[41.00s -> 42.68s]  Uh, there is no camera.
[42.68s -> 47.53s]  I'm in my living room right now.
[47.53s -> 49.53s]  Like, oh, green screen stream.
[51.27s -> 53.67s]  I painted my living room wall green.
[54.31s -> 64.15s]  I hope it looks alright.
[65.99s -> 71.06s]  Yeah, it's like I painted it like it's like a it's like a green slash blue.
[71.06s -> 72.18s]  It might not work.
[72.18s -> 78.55s]  So by the way, how are we doing?
[78.55s -> 95.74s]  Let's get it started right now.
[101.51s -> 102.55s]  That's a lot of space.
[106.33s -> 107.69s]  I haven't even done anything yet.
[107.69s -> 108.49s]  We just started.
[110.79s -> 112.15s]  I got a big living room, guys.
[112.15s -> 112.95s]  You understand?
[112.95s -> 118.22s]  I got props over here.
[118.22s -> 120.54s]  I got there's a lot of shit I have here.
[120.54s -> 123.48s]  I'm going to take this slow because I need to make sure
[123.48s -> 125.88s]  that I took a long time trying to get this correct.
[126.84s -> 128.36s]  I might need a little more light this way.
[129.75s -> 134.49s]  I'm saying like here, maybe a little bit like right.
[134.49s -> 145.50s]  Let me see.
[151.67s -> 152.87s]  Is anybody else here with me?
[152.87s -> 159.14s]  No, let me do this.
[161.24s -> 162.44s]  Take the mic with me.
[164.01s -> 165.37s]  I can't take the mic with me.
[165.37s -> 166.09s]  That's not going to work.
[172.76s -> 176.66s]  All right, let me make sure that this is correct.
[181.18s -> 188.52s]  All right, let me just let me turn this up a little so we can see.
[189.24s -> 190.60s]  What if I do this?
[199.86s -> 200.90s]  That makes it a little better, right?
[203.38s -> 204.34s]  That actually looks all right.
[206.57s -> 208.09s]  And we're in 60 FPS.
[208.65s -> 215.85s]  The 60 FPS, right?
[216.49s -> 220.17s]  That's what this thing is, right?
[220.17s -> 220.65s]  Can you see?
[221.29s -> 222.41s]  You can see all the frames, right?
[234.26s -> 236.34s]  That's yeah, 720p.
[237.14s -> 241.72s]  Yeah, to get to do 60, I have to do 720.
[241.72s -> 245.00s]  So this is 720p 60 from motion.
[245.00s -> 248.92s]  I can do 1080p 30, but I don't think it'll look as good
[249.64s -> 251.32s]  because I was doing it and I was moving around.
[251.32s -> 255.64s]  It was like you couldn't even it was hard to tell what I was even doing.
[256.12s -> 265.26s]  Try 1080.
[265.26s -> 266.95s]  Hold on.
[266.95s -> 268.55s]  You guys tell me, okay?
[268.55s -> 273.45s]  You tell me if 1080 looks better because I tried them both.
[274.01s -> 281.86s]  So this is 1080 30.
[285.26s -> 286.78s]  Let me move that.
[286.78s -> 296.60s]  I'll do some karate chops.
[297.24s -> 297.90s]  Don't worry.
[298.46s -> 300.78s]  Now, so this is 1080.
[301.34s -> 303.02s]  This is 1080 30.
[303.02s -> 307.83s]  So you see what I'm saying?
[307.83s -> 318.57s]  It's like bring it back.
[319.53s -> 321.32s]  Wait, wait, hold on a second.
[321.32s -> 321.96s]  Hold on.
[321.96s -> 327.86s]  Hold on a second.
[327.86s -> 329.30s]  This is this is 1080 30.
[331.85s -> 332.97s]  What would you rather have?
[332.97s -> 336.25s]  Higher quality image or faster karate chops?
[336.25s -> 336.97s]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[354.17s -> 357.13s]  60 fps versus disgusting 30 fps.
[361.29s -> 363.13s]  Well, we can do both.
[363.77s -> 368.09s]  We can do both.
[368.09s -> 373.64s]  Let me just make sure we got hold on.
[373.64s -> 374.58s]  Let me get this.
[381.37s -> 382.73s]  One second.
[382.73s -> 387.10s]  Hold on.
[392.54s -> 393.04s]  1080.
[395.30s -> 398.82s]  I'll give you 1080 like roundhouse kick and you see the differences, okay?
[399.46s -> 405.91s]  Well, you do think I could do roundhouse kicks.
[405.91s -> 406.39s]  Oh, wow.
[406.39s -> 408.55s]  I didn't know German could do roundhouse kicks, huh?
[410.17s -> 419.67s]  All right, now let's take a look at that.
[419.67s -> 420.63s]  It's 60.
[420.63s -> 426.90s]  You tell me which one you want more.
[435.51s -> 435.99s]  Here we go.
[443.83s -> 445.93s]  60 fps.
[446.73s -> 466.63s]  Okay, there we go.
[466.63s -> 467.83s]  All right, here's 60.
[467.83s -> 468.33s]  Ready?
[468.63s -> 471.37s]  I'll give you a roundhouse kick at 60.
[481.62s -> 482.74s]  60 or 1080.
[482.74s -> 483.94s]  You want better quality or you want...
[484.58s -> 492.18s]  Wait, it's blurry.
[492.18s -> 498.18s]  Maybe I hold on a second here.
[498.18s -> 498.50s]  Hold on.
[498.50s -> 501.56s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[501.56s -> 502.92s]  Oh, hold on a second, guys.
[503.48s -> 511.29s]  Oh, whoops.
[511.29s -> 514.50s]  Okay.
[514.50s -> 516.90s]  60 fps is nice, but doesn't look good.
[516.90s -> 528.66s]  All right, we'll do 1080 for a while.
[528.66s -> 534.23s]  Here's 1080.
[534.23s -> 536.44s]  Can I like force it to 60?
[536.44s -> 537.08s]  I don't think I can.
[537.72s -> 539.69s]  But I don't think I could even...
[539.69s -> 541.69s]  That 1080 60 would be bad.
[542.57s -> 545.05s]  I can't stream from here on 1080 60.
[545.05s -> 546.25s]  This wouldn't work.
[546.25s -> 559.00s]  Hey, let me...
[559.00s -> 559.56s]  Hold on a second.
[559.56s -> 560.76s]  Everybody stay where you are, okay?
[563.93s -> 564.33s]  I'm gonna...
[564.33s -> 565.05s]  I'm gonna...
[565.05s -> 570.41s]  I don't think I can stream it at like 6,000 or 7,000 from here.
[570.41s -> 572.01s]  I'm at 5,000 up.
[572.01s -> 576.25s]  I might be able to get away with 6,000 or 7,000.
[576.25s -> 576.65s]  I don't know.
[576.65s -> 578.23s]  Maybe not.
[578.23s -> 579.27s]  That's gonna be tricky.
[587.38s -> 588.10s]  I think this is good.
[588.82s -> 590.18s]  There is glare up here, though.
[591.22s -> 591.94s]  Over there.
[591.94s -> 592.82s]  There's glare right here.
[597.24s -> 597.72s]  All right.
[597.72s -> 607.99s]  Is it better?
[607.99s -> 611.10s]  I mean, it's...
[611.10s -> 612.86s]  This one needs to be dropping.
[612.86s -> 616.71s]  Uh-huh.
[616.71s -> 617.59s]  It's a process.
[618.23s -> 624.22s]  How's that?
[624.22s -> 624.54s]  Better?
[624.54s -> 630.39s]  I should say it's a lot better than mine.
[630.39s -> 636.94s]  But the bat...
[636.94s -> 638.06s]  I need to turn this one back on.
[638.70s -> 650.23s]  This one, not this one.
[650.23s -> 650.47s]  Okay.
[650.47s -> 657.26s]  This one is good.
[658.30s -> 665.29s]  This one is also all right.
[679.24s -> 679.80s]  Change shirt?
[679.80s -> 681.40s]  I got plenty of shirts.
[681.40s -> 688.74s]  All right.
[688.74s -> 689.54s]  I'm ready.
[689.54s -> 692.20s]  So I have...
[692.92s -> 693.40s]  Take a look.
[693.40s -> 694.28s]  You wanna see?
[694.28s -> 696.89s]  You wanna see what we're working with today?
[696.89s -> 702.46s]  I have about 100 actions.
[702.46s -> 703.26s]  Oops.
[703.26s -> 708.14s]  So I think this is as good as we're gonna get it.
[708.78s -> 710.66s]  Maybe a little bit hot.
[710.66s -> 711.38s]  No, that's all right.
[722.90s -> 733.16s]  It's a big living room.
[733.16s -> 735.64s]  Yeah, I got a 6,900 square foot house.
[745.29s -> 745.61s]  All right.
[745.61s -> 750.76s]  I really wish I could get rid of that.
[750.76s -> 752.52s]  I don't think I can get rid of that.
[753.08s -> 756.49s]  I don't think that'll be a problem keying it, though.
[756.49s -> 760.84s]  Let me try this one thing.
[760.84s -> 775.27s]  That makes that brighter.
[775.27s -> 775.51s]  Okay.
[775.51s -> 776.47s]  I'm gonna keep it like this.
[776.47s -> 778.71s]  But give me one second where I find where these are.
[780.17s -> 790.30s]  I don't know where they are.
[790.30s -> 790.54s]  Shit.
[791.18s -> 795.03s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[795.03s -> 800.18s]  Okay, here we go.
[800.18s -> 800.66s]  Almost.
[801.22s -> 808.09s]  There's a little bit of glare on the sides here.
[808.65s -> 811.82s]  Am I making...
[811.82s -> 813.02s]  I'm casting shadows though.
[813.58s -> 817.45s]  It's perfect.
[819.42s -> 820.22s]  Okay.
[820.22s -> 822.54s]  Shadow.
[823.10s -> 832.17s]  All right.
[832.17s -> 833.77s]  So how we're gonna start this is...
[833.77s -> 834.01s]  All right.
[834.01s -> 835.05s]  I might as well just start.
[839.14s -> 840.82s]  Video editors can easily handle this.
[841.62s -> 843.22s]  Well, then I'm getting rid of the shadow.
[854.70s -> 855.74s]  Oh, you get...
[858.60s -> 859.40s]  You want the...
[859.40s -> 859.88s]  Go back?
[860.70s -> 861.50s]  Oh, God.
[861.50s -> 861.90s]  All right.
[861.90s -> 862.30s]  All right.
[862.30s -> 862.62s]  Fine.
[868.44s -> 868.76s]  Okay.
[870.74s -> 871.54s]  You good?
[871.54s -> 872.26s]  We cool with this?
[876.25s -> 878.49s]  Go back.
[878.49s -> 882.49s]  All right.
[882.49s -> 883.37s]  Here we go.
[883.37s -> 885.24s]  So the first thing that I want to do...
[885.24s -> 889.66s]  Let me make sure you can be seen here.
[889.66s -> 891.18s]  So I got a lot of space here, right?
[891.18s -> 891.74s]  As you can see.
[894.30s -> 898.38s]  I'm gonna do standing, walking, running.
[899.10s -> 900.54s]  I'm gonna do it all in the same...
[901.66s -> 920.63s]  How's that?
[920.63s -> 924.14s]  Give us a tour.
[924.86s -> 926.06s]  All right.
[926.06s -> 926.62s]  I think we're good.
[927.34s -> 930.97s]  So here's what you're gonna get.
[932.76s -> 933.08s]  Ready?
[936.50s -> 936.90s]  Begin!
[937.46s -> 1039.58s]  Watch.
[1039.58s -> 1042.86s]  Okay.
[1042.86s -> 1043.26s]  There you...
[1043.26s -> 1044.92s]  That's standing.
[1044.92s -> 1045.16s]  Okay.
[1045.80s -> 1049.75s]  We got...
[1049.75s -> 1051.99s]  You got like a couple of angles, a couple of close-ups, right?
[1051.99s -> 1057.82s]  We're gonna move on.
[1057.82s -> 1058.54s]  You need more?
[1058.54s -> 1058.78s]  Okay.
[1058.78s -> 1059.42s]  I'll give you another one.
[1059.42s -> 1059.98s]  Here.
[1059.98s -> 1065.72s]  We're just getting through the general motions, you know?
[1065.72s -> 1067.00s]  So here's another like standing.
[1067.00s -> 1078.90s]  Just like kind of doing whatever.
[1078.90s -> 1079.38s]  Good day.
[1080.18s -> 1106.79s]  You're my guy, right?
[1106.79s -> 1107.86s]  All right.
[1107.86s -> 1108.50s]  Now we're gonna do...
[1111.77s -> 1113.69s]  Louder.
[1113.69s -> 1114.25s]  I know...
[1114.25s -> 1115.21s]  Guys, you have to understand.
[1115.21s -> 1117.21s]  There are like a hundred of these.
[1117.21s -> 1118.89s]  I'm just getting the good ones.
[1118.89s -> 1119.61s]  They're not the good ones.
[1119.61s -> 1121.13s]  I'm just getting like the easy ones.
[1123.21s -> 1124.17s]  Can you mic up?
[1124.89s -> 1126.89s]  I don't have like a lav mic.
[1127.53s -> 1128.58s]  I'll be louder.
[1128.58s -> 1129.06s]  Don't worry.
[1129.78s -> 1131.06s]  T-pose is on the list.
[1131.06s -> 1131.22s]  Okay.
[1131.22s -> 1131.62s]  Here we go.
[1131.62s -> 1132.02s]  You ready?
[1132.58s -> 1133.88s]  This is walking now.
[1133.88s -> 1134.36s]  Walking.
[1135.00s -> 1167.54s]  Some more...
[1167.54s -> 1169.06s]  I'll get some more walks for you.
[1169.06s -> 1178.78s]  I'll get you some walking in place.
[1178.78s -> 1197.58s]  Get some more walks here so it's a little bit hot.
[1197.58s -> 1198.78s]  A little bit more faster.
[1198.78s -> 1226.62s]  Close the camera.
[1230.17s -> 1230.97s]  What the fuck?
[1230.97s -> 1259.22s]  Now when he's running, it's like a break.
[1262.49s -> 1263.53s]  Faster?
[1263.53s -> 1306.15s]  He's coming.
[1315.94s -> 1316.66s]  Oh boy.
[1317.22s -> 1319.32s]  All right.
[1319.32s -> 1320.66s]  What else we got?
[1320.66s -> 1321.38s]  And that's it.
[1321.78s -> 1325.59s]  See you tomorrow.
[1325.59s -> 1325.83s]  All right.
[1325.83s -> 1330.28s]  I didn't bring any...
[1330.28s -> 1331.56s]  I brought coffee.
[1331.56s -> 1333.08s]  That's gonna drive me up.
[1335.82s -> 1338.22s]  I need to go drink my water from this toilet sink.
[1342.97s -> 1345.83s]  I'm gonna go drink water out of the toilet.
[1345.83s -> 1345.99s]  All right.
[1345.99s -> 1346.15s]  Hold on.
[1346.15s -> 1346.55s]  Here we go.
[1347.74s -> 1351.82s]  Next up is dashing, dodging, and crouching.
[1408.06s -> 1408.94s]  Crouching.
[1408.94s -> 1416.57s]  Walk in.
[1451.69s -> 1451.93s]  Wait.
[1451.93s -> 1453.37s]  Autofocus turned on.
[1453.37s -> 1461.18s]  Should've.
[1461.18s -> 1462.30s]  Stepping off screen.
[1462.30s -> 1464.63s]  Yeah.
[1464.63s -> 1465.19s]  I have to.
[1467.22s -> 1468.50s]  Autofocus shouldn't be on.
[1468.50s -> 1472.84s]  I just recalibrated.
[1472.84s -> 1473.16s]  All right.
[1473.16s -> 1473.64s]  Here we go.
[1475.53s -> 1475.85s]  Next.
[1482.58s -> 1484.98s]  I'm gonna like tire myself out right now.
[1484.98s -> 1486.71s]  Punch.
[1487.45s -> 1488.57s]  Being punched.
[1488.57s -> 1489.74s]  Kick.
[1489.74s -> 1491.32s]  Being kicked.
[1491.32s -> 1498.78s]  Being hit with objects.
[1498.78s -> 1499.26s]  Fuck me.
[1500.44s -> 1509.45s]  I gotta change my clothes soon here.
[1509.45s -> 1510.09s]  All right.
[1510.09s -> 1512.34s]  Let's do it.
[1512.34s -> 1524.62s]  I'm doing like all the Mortal Kombat moves.
[1524.62s -> 1537.29s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[1537.29s -> 1537.77s]  Yep.
[1537.77s -> 1545.08s]  I don't want to fight you.
[1545.08s -> 1545.88s]  I don't want to.
[1545.88s -> 1547.72s]  I don't want to fight you, man.
[1547.72s -> 1548.04s]  I don't...
[1550.66s -> 1552.58s]  I didn't want to knock you out, but I didn't.
[1561.96s -> 1565.37s]  Oh, did you think I was going to catch it?
[1565.37s -> 1569.90s]  That's it.
[1569.90s -> 1571.02s]  Broken bones.
[1572.06s -> 1572.78s]  That's it.
[1572.78s -> 1574.06s]  And the ground.
[1576.62s -> 1579.29s]  How are you going to use that?
[1581.66s -> 1583.18s]  My shoelace came untied.
[1584.74s -> 1585.46s]  All right.
[1585.46s -> 1586.55s]  Kicks.
[1587.19s -> 1604.22s]  Oh, I just ripped my pants.
[1607.42s -> 1608.86s]  My pants almost just ripped in half.
[1609.50s -> 1610.54s]  Holy shit.
[1611.34s -> 1617.94s]  Oh, yeah?
[1622.84s -> 1623.80s]  That's two backhands.
[1624.44s -> 1629.82s]  Ooh, two.
[1629.82s -> 1636.26s]  I'm supposed to be doing kicks.
[1636.26s -> 1640.50s]  We'll do one of these.
[1645.90s -> 1665.98s]  Try again.
[1665.98s -> 1669.82s]  Fuck you.
[1669.82s -> 1670.30s]  All right.
[1670.30s -> 1671.02s]  I got to get hit.
[1671.02s -> 1671.66s]  I got to get hit.
[1676.55s -> 1678.04s]  Face.
[1678.04s -> 1678.60s]  Each arm.
[1678.60s -> 1679.16s]  Each leg.
[1730.31s -> 1731.94s]  Why do I keep the puke?
[1738.33s -> 1738.89s]  The shoe.
[1738.89s -> 1740.52s]  My shoe's untied.
[1740.52s -> 1741.48s]  God damn it.
[1741.48s -> 1748.73s]  I have to puke every time.
[1748.73s -> 1755.66s]  All right, we're done.
[1755.66s -> 1763.08s]  You.
[1763.08s -> 1764.28s]  It's time for you to pay.
[1764.84s -> 1767.29s]  You're going down.
[1767.85s -> 1775.86s]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[1775.86s -> 1785.14s]  What is that?
[1787.27s -> 1791.10s]  All right.
[1791.10s -> 1795.53s]  Give me, let me get a toilet water break.
[1795.53s -> 1796.33s]  I'll be right back.
[1796.33s -> 1826.44s]  I haven't even gotten to the props yet, guys.
[1826.44s -> 1828.28s]  There's a bag of props over here.
[1829.00s -> 1830.36s]  There's a bag of props right there.
[1834.09s -> 1834.81s]  All right.
[1834.81s -> 1836.42s]  So that settles that.
[1836.98s -> 1838.26s]  Please do a fat roll.
[1838.26s -> 1839.06s]  We'll get to that in a second.
[1839.06s -> 1839.38s]  Hold on.
[1843.24s -> 1843.56s]  All right.
[1843.56s -> 1846.10s]  So climbing.
[1846.82s -> 1848.36s]  I'm going to climb.
[1849.00s -> 1849.90s]  Climb.
[1855.82s -> 1865.26s]  Let's climb.
[1889.78s -> 1898.34s]  Made it to the top.
[1909.51s -> 1910.47s]  That's not going to work.
[1910.47s -> 1941.35s]  I can't do it.
[1941.35s -> 1941.99s]  I can't do it.
[1941.99s -> 1942.71s]  I can't do it.
[1992.57s -> 1993.21s]  Okay.
[1993.21s -> 2000.38s]  That doesn't even work.
[2000.38s -> 2000.86s]  All right, here we go.
[2000.86s -> 2001.34s]  All right.
[2001.34s -> 2007.83s]  Just a little.
[2007.83s -> 2013.62s]  Because here is a flat surface right here, man.
[2019.56s -> 2020.92s]  I'm doing this the wrong way.
[2021.93s -> 2024.78s]  I have to do it this way.
[2024.78s -> 2025.98s]  This does that.
[2025.98s -> 2027.26s]  This is what is here.
[2028.14s -> 2028.86s]  It's me.
[2028.86s -> 2029.98s]  I'm in front of a screen.
[2031.24s -> 2032.44s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[2033.42s -> 2033.98s]  That's better.
[2038.95s -> 2039.83s]  Why am I on this?
[2039.83s -> 2040.63s]  Just go like this.
[2045.14s -> 2047.38s]  Why am I doing the struggling to get over a cliff?
[2048.10s -> 2054.65s]  I don't know why I'm into that right now.
[2054.65s -> 2055.85s]  That's you up there.
[2055.85s -> 2056.65s]  Hey.
[2056.65s -> 2058.78s]  Can you throw me down a life raft or something?
[2059.99s -> 2061.19s]  No life raft.
[2061.19s -> 2061.75s]  Don't worry.
[2061.75s -> 2062.23s]  I'll get it.
[2064.86s -> 2068.22s]  My fucking pants just fell down.
[2069.10s -> 2074.09s]  Hey, can you give me a hand down here?
[2074.09s -> 2075.93s]  That's like a 400 foot jump.
[2076.97s -> 2078.33s]  I guess I'll give it a try.
[2078.33s -> 2078.65s]  No, no.
[2078.65s -> 2079.53s]  Don't worry about me.
[2080.97s -> 2081.77s]  Two.
[2081.77s -> 2082.09s]  Three.
[2086.47s -> 2087.11s]  No, I'm good, man.
[2087.11s -> 2091.59s]  I'm good.
[2091.59s -> 2101.56s]  Idiot.
[2101.56s -> 2109.46s]  All right.
[2109.46s -> 2110.10s]  Cam back down.
[2110.10s -> 2110.82s]  Yeah, I'll get it.
[2115.40s -> 2115.80s]  All right.
[2115.80s -> 2119.46s]  Now, now we're going to do facial reactions.
[2129.59s -> 2130.07s]  Cam down.
[2130.07s -> 2130.63s]  Oh, no, I will.
[2130.63s -> 2131.27s]  I will.
[2131.27s -> 2133.64s]  I got to get these, though.
[2133.64s -> 2139.72s]  It's like, right, right.
[2139.72s -> 2140.76s]  It's good, right?
[2140.76s -> 2165.29s]  Say it again.
[2165.29s -> 2177.75s]  Come on.
[2177.75s -> 2178.79s]  These are close-ups.
[2178.79s -> 2180.31s]  These are close-ups.
[2180.31s -> 2182.87s]  So you can get my facial reactions.
[2182.87s -> 2183.59s]  Come on, right?
[2183.59s -> 2230.82s]  Please.
[2230.82s -> 2232.26s]  It's my birthday today.
[2232.26s -> 2233.38s]  Thanks, everybody.
[2233.38s -> 2234.82s]  No, that's supposed to be a surprise birthday party.
[2234.82s -> 2235.38s]  Come on.
[2235.38s -> 2247.62s]  I mean, why is it so dark in here?
[2247.62s -> 2248.34s]  Honey?
[2248.34s -> 2250.36s]  Honey?
[2256.73s -> 2258.17s]  Oh, it's my birthday.
[2267.83s -> 2270.23s]  The doorknob is up at his chest.
[2270.23s -> 2289.66s]  Can I just put it right here?
[2289.66s -> 2290.70s]  Right on the chin.
[2290.70s -> 2292.22s]  Right on the chin.
[2292.22s -> 2293.02s]  Right there.
[2293.02s -> 2299.66s]  Ooh.
[2299.66s -> 2301.02s]  Ear lawsuit inbound.
[2301.02s -> 2301.98s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[2301.98s -> 2307.27s]  Throw some punches the other way.
[2307.27s -> 2312.47s]  So you think about this brain screen, right?
[2312.47s -> 2313.85s]  Get close, like here.
[2313.85s -> 2315.99s]  I need to, like, blow it out.
[2315.99s -> 2320.17s]  It's designed for me to be, like, standing here.
[2320.89s -> 2325.43s]  But, dude, I didn't release full-body stuff.
[2325.43s -> 2326.71s]  Maybe I'll blow it out and get some more.
[2327.83s -> 2334.10s]  Do some more screaming.
[2334.90s -> 2339.40s]  Too much head room.
[2340.30s -> 2343.74s]  Ah, I mean, but that's all I got for the green on the bottom, though.
[2345.06s -> 2347.70s]  I mean, in the editing program, right, you'll just take it.
[2348.97s -> 2352.41s]  You'll just take this side and this side and just get it from here, you know?
[2352.41s -> 2354.89s]  So hopefully this is not going to be too much of a blowout.
[2354.89s -> 2357.24s]  I don't think it will be.
[2357.24s -> 2359.64s]  But I'll do some more of this stuff with the back blown out.
[2359.64s -> 2367.43s]  So there is no shadow at all.
[2367.43s -> 2369.02s]  Anyways, let's get going.
[2369.74s -> 2374.90s]  I hope you brought green clothes.
[2378.38s -> 2379.66s]  Well, I guess, here, hold on.
[2380.66s -> 2381.78s]  I can do this.
[2381.78s -> 2382.82s]  Let me test something here.
[2385.72s -> 2387.64s]  Because I have, like, a tester.
[2388.28s -> 2389.61s]  Let's see how it works.
[2390.17s -> 2399.00s]  Okay, let me just get it on here.
[2404.25s -> 2407.45s]  Because this will be able to give us a good indication of how this is going to play out.
[2408.01s -> 2413.99s]  Let me loop it.
[2413.99s -> 2414.71s]  Then you tell me.
[2415.43s -> 2440.04s]  Okay, let's get a green key on here.
[2440.68s -> 2446.95s]  And make sure I have it on there correctly.
[2455.62s -> 2456.26s]  Green!
[2460.87s -> 2462.39s]  Why is this not doing it?
[2462.39s -> 2467.11s]  Okay, let's take a look.
[2478.98s -> 2480.58s]  Ah, the beach!
[2481.14s -> 2502.25s]  It's like, it's a little watery here.
[2502.65s -> 2503.69s]  It's a little too watery.
[2509.48s -> 2510.36s]  He's giant.
[2513.99s -> 2518.90s]  Well, also, keep in mind, this is like, just, this is like the, I just have this through OBS.
[2518.90s -> 2521.82s]  You know what I mean?
[2521.82s -> 2522.94s]  So let me see if I do this.
[2524.90s -> 2526.90s]  This is just like the default settings through OBS.
[2535.38s -> 2536.02s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2536.66s -> 2537.94s]  If I mess with the settings a little bit.
[2546.31s -> 2547.67s]  I'm transparent!
[2547.67s -> 2559.22s]  Let me see.
[2559.86s -> 2572.04s]  I mean, with playing around the settings, whoever is, you know, going to be using it,
[2573.53s -> 2574.41s]  I think it'll be all right.
[2583.34s -> 2583.74s]  Yeah!
[2592.95s -> 2598.84s]  Okay, so I'm going to turn this off.
[2604.73s -> 2607.61s]  Don't worry, I'm getting in a full suit in doing a weather report, guys.
[2607.61s -> 2608.25s]  Don't worry.
[2608.25s -> 2618.41s]  We just, we've only been live for 40 minutes.
[2618.41s -> 2621.43s]  I got like, I got like another hour and a half worth of stuff to do.
[2621.43s -> 2624.60s]  I just, I'm just doing the basics.
[2628.89s -> 2630.65s]  It's nine more hours.
[2630.65s -> 2632.01s]  I don't know about that.
[2632.01s -> 2632.81s]  All right, so here you go.
[2635.11s -> 2638.09s]  So now, I gotta get chased.
[2638.73s -> 2640.09s]  And then I have to chase someone.
[2640.73s -> 2644.52s]  So that looks all right.
[2644.52s -> 2651.58s]  So here's the chase sequence.
[2651.58s -> 2655.59s]  So I'm going to be going from this way to that way.
[2655.59s -> 2657.83s]  So I have to chase, and then I have to chase somebody else.
[2664.95s -> 2665.51s]  Get back here!
[2666.31s -> 2667.11s]  You get back here!
[2668.38s -> 2669.50s]  Come here, you bastard!
[2673.53s -> 2674.49s]  Get the fuck out of the way!
[2674.49s -> 2675.77s]  Get out of the way, you fucking idiot!
[2675.77s -> 2676.65s]  Hey, come here!
[2676.65s -> 2677.21s]  Get back!
[2677.21s -> 2677.85s]  I don't know where to go.
[2680.73s -> 2683.06s]  I need, give me that!
[2683.70s -> 2696.36s]  Okay.
[2696.36s -> 2701.62s]  Get over here!
[2701.62s -> 2703.22s]  Get out of the fucking way!
[2705.38s -> 2705.94s]  What?
[2705.94s -> 2711.38s]  I'm in the middle of a chase, that's all I hear.
[2711.38s -> 2712.84s]  That's all I hear.
[2712.84s -> 2714.34s]  Shut up.
[2714.34s -> 2714.82s]  Shut up!
[2720.33s -> 2723.13s]  Hey, get in your car.
[2723.13s -> 2724.25s]  Hey, hey!
[2724.25s -> 2731.93s]  Get back here!
[2731.93s -> 2733.69s]  All right, now I gotta get chased.
[2745.26s -> 2746.14s]  Oh, Jesus!
[2748.17s -> 2749.05s]  Oh, no!
[2749.05s -> 2749.77s]  Please!
[2749.77s -> 2750.33s]  Oh, my God!
[2771.83s -> 2790.89s]  Right in my head!
[2790.89s -> 2792.18s]  Toilet water.
[2792.18s -> 2793.14s]  Be right back.
[2793.14s -> 2840.71s]  Jesus, running in place is so much fucking harder
[2840.71s -> 2841.99s]  than just running in general.
[2849.48s -> 2851.80s]  Getting winded after light exercise.
[2851.80s -> 2853.16s]  No, it's the running in place.
[2856.09s -> 2858.22s]  All right.
[2858.22s -> 2860.86s]  Now I gotta walk backwards, terrified of something.
[2861.50s -> 2864.30s]  Don't worry, I'm going to do death animations.
[2864.30s -> 2864.70s]  Don't worry.
[2865.34s -> 2877.54s]  We need some up close stuff, too.
[2877.54s -> 2878.26s]  Like, chasing.
[2878.98s -> 2881.78s]  Like, so you can get from like here,
[2881.78s -> 2882.74s]  from like, you know, from here up.
[2887.27s -> 2901.45s]  Oh, not hungry.
[2901.45s -> 2902.33s]  What the fuck?
[2908.81s -> 2909.13s]  Really?
[2909.85s -> 2910.33s]  Really?
[2910.33s -> 2911.13s]  Dude, really?
[2933.70s -> 2941.24s]  Really, Scoob?
[2941.24s -> 2941.80s]  Okay.
[2941.80s -> 2949.50s]  Away from something.
[2949.50s -> 2957.99s]  Yes.
[2957.99s -> 2960.42s]  Just trying to go to the bathroom.
[2960.42s -> 2971.54s]  Easy.
[2972.18s -> 2973.27s]  Easy.
[2984.92s -> 2986.04s]  You got something to say?
[2986.92s -> 2989.74s]  Oh, look at me!
[2989.74s -> 2990.70s]  Look at me!
[2990.70s -> 3015.13s]  Look at me!
[3015.13s -> 3016.57s]  Stop running.
[3016.57s -> 3023.54s]  All right, I mean.
[3023.54s -> 3025.38s]  Isn't that just wonderful?
[3025.38s -> 3026.50s]  Oh, look at me!
[3026.50s -> 3031.00s]  Fucking idiot.
[3033.56s -> 3035.64s]  I'm the man.
[3035.64s -> 3043.38s]  I'm the man.
[3043.38s -> 3043.88s]  Oh!
[3045.80s -> 3046.76s]  Hey, fellas!
[3047.40s -> 3048.60s]  He thinks he's dumb!
[3050.46s -> 3051.02s]  Look at me!
[3051.02s -> 3068.28s]  Was the girl the best?
[3069.66s -> 3074.76s]  Hey, look at me!
[3074.76s -> 3076.04s]  Ah, yeah, that's right!
[3081.83s -> 3083.11s]  I don't know why I'm doing that.
[3085.82s -> 3086.38s]  Stop.
[3087.02s -> 3088.54s]  Stop doing this.
[3089.26s -> 3100.33s]  All right, ready?
[3101.66s -> 3102.06s]  Next!
[3104.07s -> 3105.67s]  Oh, god.
[3105.67s -> 3106.87s]  This is where we're going to get weird.
[3107.43s -> 3140.34s]  There's your T-pose.
[3140.34s -> 3141.86s]  Let's get a close-up a little bit closer.
[3141.86s -> 3152.22s]  You're like, look at me!
[3152.22s -> 3153.53s]  Loser.
[3153.53s -> 3154.17s]  Loser.
[3160.10s -> 3161.06s]  All sides.
[3162.66s -> 3170.17s]  Fucking really?
[3170.17s -> 3171.37s]  All angles!
[3171.37s -> 3197.83s]  I feel like I'm at the tailor.
[3213.54s -> 3238.84s]  Good.
[3238.84s -> 3240.33s]  Scanning.
[3240.33s -> 3241.77s]  Character select screen.
[3246.39s -> 3247.11s]  Face scan.
[3247.11s -> 3248.79s]  Oh, my fucking god.
[3248.79s -> 3249.59s]  Hold on.
[3249.59s -> 3258.10s]  Give me a second.
[3258.10s -> 3262.65s]  I'll spin around.
[3262.65s -> 3268.97s]  What the hell is the editor?
[3268.97s -> 3271.40s]  There it is.
[3271.40s -> 3271.88s]  Look at me.
[3276.92s -> 3277.16s]  So.
[3277.80s -> 3283.30s]  Yeah, it's really cool.
[3283.30s -> 3284.90s]  I sat in the chair and they did it.
[3284.90s -> 3286.02s]  They scanned me.
[3286.02s -> 3290.62s]  And they always have this fucking weird face too.
[3302.06s -> 3302.70s]  Too fast?
[3319.00s -> 3323.14s]  Well, the autofocus.
[3323.14s -> 3324.18s]  Fucking autofocus.
[3325.45s -> 3335.05s]  Stop autofocusing.
[3344.22s -> 3344.94s]  All right, I'm done.
[3384.33s -> 3385.61s]  It gets smaller.
[3387.26s -> 3389.05s]  God.
[3389.05s -> 3397.18s]  All right.
[3397.18s -> 3398.14s]  Do a close-up.
[3398.14s -> 3398.70s]  Look at me.
[3405.48s -> 3406.36s]  I can't just do it.
[3406.36s -> 3407.32s]  I can't just do it.
[3407.32s -> 3410.10s]  What was it like?
[3410.10s -> 3411.70s]  This and then like this.
[3414.01s -> 3415.45s]  I don't remember what it was.
[3415.45s -> 3416.33s]  What did I do?
[3416.89s -> 3418.74s]  I don't know what I did.
[3418.74s -> 3427.50s]  I think it was like that and like that.
[3427.50s -> 3429.66s]  So you'd be like, huh.
[3429.66s -> 3431.59s]  You sure are talking a lot.
[3431.59s -> 3432.39s]  Oh, look at me.
[3433.59s -> 3437.82s]  No, I didn't do it right.
[3437.82s -> 3438.62s]  Oh, yeah.
[3439.50s -> 3440.54s]  Interesting thought process.
[3440.54s -> 3441.50s]  Wait, look at me.
[3441.50s -> 3442.38s]  Look at me.
[3442.38s -> 3443.34s]  That's what you sound like.
[3447.16s -> 3452.78s]  Why do I have to hit someone?
[3452.78s -> 3454.94s]  Why do I have to like slap somebody?
[3459.08s -> 3462.17s]  Okay, this is where it gets real.
[3523.38s -> 3526.84s]  I see him down there.
[3526.84s -> 3527.88s]  Roger that.
[3527.88s -> 3528.68s]  Taking target out.
[3541.85s -> 3544.01s]  And then like you've got like missiles coming at it.
[3544.01s -> 3544.41s]  But hold on.
[3544.41s -> 3545.21s]  I didn't fit it.
[3545.21s -> 3551.05s]  So now you're going to take it from here.
[3552.25s -> 3580.30s]  This guy's 33.
[3580.86s -> 3583.67s]  Hand was outside.
[3597.93s -> 3601.88s]  I can't balance for that long.
[3601.88s -> 3622.49s]  Why would I be flying like that?
[3622.49s -> 3641.74s]  I got to get these done because it's going to fucking hurt.
[3702.49s -> 3704.25s]  Time for a different shirt.
[3704.25s -> 3716.52s]  Toilet water.
[3716.52s -> 3763.34s]  Oh, by the way, Germania 2018 is next weekend.
[3763.34s -> 3784.18s]  Oh, what a drop.
[3784.18s -> 3785.38s]  He dropped it.
[3785.38s -> 3786.58s]  He dropped it.
[3786.58s -> 3789.48s]  All right, how are we doing?
[3789.48s -> 3793.94s]  We're doing all right.
[3794.02s -> 3802.28s]  Okay, now I have to do a cliche superhero landing with a pose and a smirk.
[3820.52s -> 3821.72s]  This is going to take me a few times.
[3821.72s -> 3825.88s]  I don't like it.
[3825.88s -> 3830.97s]  What is this?
[3854.98s -> 3860.23s]  Find the center.
[3864.14s -> 3865.90s]  Bitch, that's two.
[3865.90s -> 3866.70s]  I can't do it.
[3867.34s -> 3867.98s]  I hate it.
[3869.19s -> 3869.91s]  I hate it.
[3897.62s -> 3900.81s]  You're expecting someone else.
[3919.69s -> 3923.46s]  I killed like 10 birds coming down.
[3923.46s -> 3926.81s]  I'm expecting someone else.
[3936.71s -> 3937.83s]  I didn't do it.
[3937.83s -> 3941.94s]  Somehow I like punched the ground.
[3943.11s -> 3944.63s]  I actually did do the landing there.
[3985.91s -> 3992.81s]  Why are you winding up your other hand?
[3992.81s -> 3994.01s]  Wrong hand.
[3995.45s -> 3995.77s]  Hold on.
[3995.77s -> 3997.29s]  So I went down with this.
[3998.84s -> 4004.28s]  All right, where's my phone?
[4004.28s -> 4005.16s]  I gotta see what the next thing is.
[4005.80s -> 4009.24s]  I haven't even gotten to the props.
[4013.56s -> 4019.93s]  Okay, point around in amazement, horror, and excitement.
[4019.93s -> 4040.30s]  Wow, you see?
[4040.94s -> 4043.03s]  I read about that.
[4043.03s -> 4048.02s]  Nice.
[4048.02s -> 4060.17s]  Look at that one.
[4060.17s -> 4060.65s]  Hey, mom.
[4061.21s -> 4062.01s]  Mom, I see it.
[4063.86s -> 4064.34s]  Yeah.
[4064.34s -> 4065.22s]  Wow.
[4065.22s -> 4073.98s]  Is it right there or is it over here?
[4073.98s -> 4075.29s]  I can't tell.
[4090.15s -> 4093.10s]  Now, this is show business.
[4099.94s -> 4102.41s]  Yeah, now that's show business.
[4102.41s -> 4124.54s]  I'm doing right now.
[4124.54s -> 4126.70s]  Spider-Man sweat mark.
[4126.70s -> 4130.98s]  Where?
[4130.98s -> 4142.79s]  Point in more directions.
[4142.79s -> 4143.43s]  Okay.
[4143.43s -> 4152.39s]  I don't know.
[4155.00s -> 4155.88s]  Don't step in that.
[4155.88s -> 4193.56s]  I don't know what kind of step on that.
[4193.56s -> 4194.44s]  Buy a belt.
[4195.24s -> 4196.68s]  I got too fat.
[4196.68s -> 4208.74s]  Now we have to do horror.
[4208.74s -> 4209.06s]  What?
[4209.70s -> 4210.02s]  What?
[4210.58s -> 4212.25s]  What is that?
[4212.25s -> 4213.77s]  What is that?
[4213.77s -> 4217.83s]  What is this thing right here?
[4217.83s -> 4218.31s]  What?
[4218.31s -> 4219.75s]  What the fuck is that?
[4220.47s -> 4228.90s]  What is that?
[4230.68s -> 4243.77s]  What is that thing?
[4243.77s -> 4245.13s]  What?
[4245.13s -> 4246.58s]  What?
[4246.58s -> 4248.42s]  What the fuck is that?
[4248.42s -> 4250.81s]  What's that?
[4250.81s -> 4252.31s]  What's that one?
[4252.31s -> 4252.95s]  What's that one?
[4252.95s -> 4253.59s]  They're everywhere.
[4257.99s -> 4260.50s]  Stay on.
[4260.50s -> 4260.82s]  Hold on.
[4267.06s -> 4269.59s]  That right there.
[4269.59s -> 4270.23s]  That's why.
[4271.83s -> 4272.39s]  That's why.
[4280.74s -> 4281.54s]  That right there.
[4282.26s -> 4283.78s]  That's the reason right there.
[4286.90s -> 4287.70s]  I'm like lost.
[4290.58s -> 4292.02s]  The follower button.
[4292.02s -> 4292.58s]  Hey, man.
[4293.22s -> 4294.34s]  Welcome to the stream.
[4294.34s -> 4295.30s]  My name's Jerma.
[4295.30s -> 4295.94s]  Nice to meet you.
[4295.94s -> 4296.34s]  Right there.
[4296.34s -> 4296.90s]  Bingo.
[4296.90s -> 4297.22s]  Right there.
[4297.22s -> 4298.10s]  That's the follow button.
[4298.10s -> 4298.74s]  If you click that,
[4299.46s -> 4301.54s]  every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming.
[4302.18s -> 4305.54s]  And I do lots of fun things on this stream like
[4307.93s -> 4308.97s]  playing Hitman.
[4308.97s -> 4310.25s]  We played that last night.
[4310.25s -> 4313.14s]  That's right there.
[4315.26s -> 4315.82s]  Holy shit.
[4315.82s -> 4316.46s]  Look at that hair.
[4321.91s -> 4322.87s]  Right here, right?
[4322.87s -> 4325.22s]  Hey, let me do you a favor.
[4329.93s -> 4332.89s]  So you made it to the YouTube homepage.
[4332.89s -> 4333.45s]  How are you?
[4333.45s -> 4334.41s]  My name's Frank.
[4334.41s -> 4336.09s]  I'm your digital guy.
[4336.09s -> 4337.53s]  As you see here,
[4337.53s -> 4339.37s]  here's your viewing screen.
[4339.37s -> 4340.89s]  This screen right here is going to show you
[4340.89s -> 4342.57s]  some of your favorite videos
[4342.57s -> 4344.41s]  from Gangnam style
[4344.41s -> 4347.29s]  all the way to your grandma's outer fishing trip.
[4347.93s -> 4348.97s]  This is right here.
[4348.97s -> 4350.33s]  This is your space.
[4350.49s -> 4353.21s]  Down here, you've got the like button.
[4353.21s -> 4354.73s]  If you like a piece of content,
[4354.73s -> 4355.85s]  go ahead and press it.
[4355.85s -> 4357.77s]  If you don't like a piece of content,
[4357.77s -> 4359.37s]  ooh, thumbs down.
[4359.37s -> 4360.25s]  That's over there too.
[4360.81s -> 4361.69s]  On this side,
[4362.65s -> 4364.09s]  they're both going to keep up with me here.
[4364.65s -> 4366.49s]  Here's the subscribe button.
[4366.49s -> 4369.61s]  And if you like a content enough to want to subscribe
[4369.61s -> 4373.45s]  and potentially lose their videos on your feed
[4373.45s -> 4374.81s]  because we don't do that anymore,
[4374.81s -> 4375.69s]  you have to click a bell.
[4375.69s -> 4377.29s]  The bell's over here by the way.
[4377.29s -> 4379.13s]  Click that bell right there.
[4379.13s -> 4380.65s]  And then click another couple of buttons.
[4380.65s -> 4382.17s]  And then maybe you'll be able to see the content
[4382.17s -> 4382.97s]  you subscribe to.
[4383.77s -> 4384.81s]  This is your space.
[4385.77s -> 4387.05s]  This is it right here.
[4400.81s -> 4402.09s]  That was passive aggressive.
[4409.46s -> 4411.62s]  Oh, I almost forgot to mention.
[4411.62s -> 4413.54s]  That's me Frank again from Nvidia.
[4415.02s -> 4416.86s]  Hey, I almost forgot to mention.
[4416.86s -> 4418.30s]  Hey, it's me again.
[4418.30s -> 4419.26s]  The YouTube guy.
[4420.30s -> 4421.26s]  This is your space.
[4421.26s -> 4422.62s]  We talked about your space.
[4422.62s -> 4424.30s]  Well, better get out of the way.
[4424.30s -> 4426.14s]  I'm in front of your video right now.
[4426.78s -> 4428.22s]  Hey, pause it though.
[4429.24s -> 4431.48s]  This space right here is your fuck.
[4435.75s -> 4437.03s]  Hey, it's me again.
[4437.67s -> 4441.19s]  The YouTube guy that's in the corner of your videos
[4441.19s -> 4442.63s]  that comes up and gives you digital help.
[4444.90s -> 4446.18s]  I better get out of your space.
[4449.80s -> 4450.44s]  Here we go.
[4450.44s -> 4451.64s]  Now I'm here.
[4451.64s -> 4452.84s]  Fucking God damn it.
[4453.80s -> 4459.43s]  I have something very specific I want to say.
[4460.71s -> 4463.86s]  Hey, it's me.
[4463.86s -> 4466.74s]  The YouTube paperclip guy from Microsoft.
[4466.74s -> 4468.98s]  Except I'm another digital representation of hell.
[4470.02s -> 4472.42s]  Whoa, I'm in your space right now.
[4472.42s -> 4473.86s]  Whoopsie, I'm over here.
[4474.50s -> 4477.38s]  So if you want to monetize on YouTube,
[4478.26s -> 4478.98s]  click up there.
[4479.94s -> 4481.46s]  That button over there.
[4481.46s -> 4482.98s]  That's going to bring down a drop down
[4482.98s -> 4485.14s]  to click on the monetize button.
[4485.14s -> 4486.18s]  Whoa, but be careful.
[4486.90s -> 4489.30s]  We pay demonetize your entire channel
[4489.30s -> 4490.82s]  because nobody works here.
[4490.82s -> 4493.78s]  We just kind of put bots up that catch random shit.
[4493.78s -> 4495.62s]  And you might be caught in the crossfire.
[4495.62s -> 4498.58s]  But this is your space right here.
[4498.58s -> 4500.34s]  Oh, we've ruined entire channels
[4500.34s -> 4502.74s]  because we demonetized the entire channel.
[4502.74s -> 4503.70s]  Don't worry about that.
[4504.26s -> 4508.34s]  This is what you need to be concerned with right here.
[4512.12s -> 4513.32s]  I'll be going this way now.
[4525.56s -> 4526.76s]  So passive aggressive.
[4527.40s -> 4536.26s]  That wasn't even part of the show.
[4548.20s -> 4549.32s]  Oh, I got to do this one too.
[4552.90s -> 4556.28s]  By the way, disclaimer.
[4556.28s -> 4557.32s]  Hey, it's me again.
[4557.32s -> 4560.65s]  Disclaimer, I am in no way a YouTube
[4560.65s -> 4564.17s]  or any of its practices or its headquarters.
[4564.17s -> 4566.33s]  I'm just your friendly neighborhood
[4566.33s -> 4568.25s]  paperclip digital help guide guy.
[4569.50s -> 4570.06s]  There we go.
[4576.20s -> 4577.16s]  See, there you go.
[4581.82s -> 4582.78s]  Edit it out quick.
[4582.78s -> 4584.38s]  See, you can't edit it out because I just said it.
[4588.39s -> 4589.59s]  Rerecord the audio.
[4593.53s -> 4594.89s]  All right, I will mic a lot of these.
[4594.89s -> 4595.77s]  Don't worry.
[4595.77s -> 4601.32s]  We're blurry on the left side.
[4602.20s -> 4615.75s]  Like over here.
[4616.31s -> 4627.22s]  We're good.
[4627.22s -> 4627.72s]  All right.
[4630.84s -> 4634.92s]  All right, I got to.
[4634.92s -> 4636.12s]  Oh, this one's going to suck.
[4639.75s -> 4645.22s]  I have to fall and do this.
[4658.28s -> 4669.37s]  Do that right.
[4669.37s -> 4670.73s]  That's bloating to it.
[4675.27s -> 4676.23s]  Now, whatever.
[4676.23s -> 4678.01s]  That's not that high, right?
[4678.73s -> 4680.09s]  It's not about that high up.
[4680.09s -> 4683.91s]  I'm probably like 150,000 feet.
[4683.91s -> 4685.59s]  That's not going to, it's going to, right?
[4686.39s -> 4687.70s]  Let's roll.
[4691.22s -> 4692.82s]  The ground is coming real fast.
[4695.02s -> 4704.30s]  Holy shit, it worked.
[4704.30s -> 4726.57s]  I feel fine.
[4726.57s -> 4728.17s]  Side view is necessary.
[4738.18s -> 4745.14s]  This is your space.
[4749.37s -> 4750.97s]  Why do people do this?
[4750.97s -> 4753.05s]  There's no reason to do what I'm doing, right?
[4753.05s -> 4754.49s]  If you were falling,
[4754.49s -> 4756.01s]  you would be going like this.
[4756.97s -> 4758.17s]  You would just be like.
[4766.52s -> 4767.96s]  Why do we, why, what is this?
[4769.56s -> 4771.37s]  This is like I'm an actor.
[4771.37s -> 4772.79s]  Brain scrape, right?
[4780.26s -> 4782.34s]  My underwear.
[4783.30s -> 4784.10s]  Shit, it's all right.
[4791.90s -> 4792.78s]  Okay, what's next?
[4800.31s -> 4802.79s]  Something move.
[4802.79s -> 4803.59s]  Okay, there we go.
[4803.59s -> 4804.71s]  This got like knocked over.
[4805.27s -> 4808.33s]  For some reason that got like tilted.
[4809.43s -> 4813.53s]  Don't ask me why, but it did.
[4814.73s -> 4818.34s]  Weirdly enough, fall towards the camera.
[4819.06s -> 4826.33s]  I mean like, oh, I know what you mean.
[4826.33s -> 4827.61s]  Like go into the camera.
[4832.62s -> 4833.34s]  Here we go again.
[4834.36s -> 4836.76s]  Oh, no, no.
[4838.84s -> 4846.70s]  Why would I be looking at you?
[4849.06s -> 4850.02s]  Oh, shit.
[4854.46s -> 4862.60s]  Was I doing my ABCs?
[4864.34s -> 4865.86s]  Why would you do that before you died?
[4871.03s -> 4872.15s]  Follow you back to it.
[4872.15s -> 4872.71s]  Take care.
[4872.71s -> 4874.47s]  Okay, I gotta line this up.
[4885.94s -> 4887.30s]  Look at my back sweat.
[4887.30s -> 4889.78s]  I got like fucking 4,000 pounds of lights on me.
[4918.22s -> 4922.02s]  Okay, this one's gonna be good.
[4922.02s -> 4922.66s]  I like this one.
[4954.04s -> 4955.48s]  I can't, I can't get up.
[4955.48s -> 4957.24s]  I can't get up.
[4957.24s -> 4960.33s]  I think it's fucking too heavy.
[4962.15s -> 4973.19s]  If I go down, maybe though.
[5010.65s -> 5040.70s]  Oh, what a day's work.
[5040.70s -> 5041.98s]  Invest in a belt.
[5044.14s -> 5045.82s]  I had a lot of other things to think about
[5045.82s -> 5047.18s]  than putting a belt on today.
[5047.18s -> 5051.62s]  It's all right, I'm about to get in pajamas anyways.
[5051.62s -> 5055.67s]  All right, I might as well do this.
[5055.67s -> 5063.05s]  This is like one of the most requested things
[5063.05s -> 5064.01s]  that everyone wanted me to do.
[5064.01s -> 5065.45s]  So I'm gonna get them like here.
[5065.45s -> 5066.97s]  We'll start, we'll start here.
[5066.97s -> 5072.46s]  Okay, so ready?
[5147.19s -> 5156.63s]  No doubt.
[5163.82s -> 5166.14s]  Huh?
[5166.14s -> 5167.14s]  What?
[5167.14s -> 5168.73s]  What?
[5168.73s -> 5169.45s]  What?
[5169.45s -> 5171.05s]  Oh, no, my magical powers.
[5173.38s -> 5174.18s]  Earth.
[5174.18s -> 5174.58s]  Earth.
[5175.32s -> 5176.44s]  Earth is on fire.
[5181.64s -> 5183.34s]  What?
[5183.34s -> 5184.14s]  What?
[5184.14s -> 5184.38s]  No.
[5189.24s -> 5190.28s]  I just shit my pants.
[5190.92s -> 5191.96s]  I can't do it anymore.
[5210.49s -> 5211.37s]  Take the shirt off.
[5211.37s -> 5213.29s]  I can't take the shirt off.
[5213.29s -> 5219.54s]  Now I'm gonna do like various spells.
[5230.82s -> 5231.94s]  Fucking God damn it.
[5272.18s -> 5273.54s]  What the fuck was that?
[5286.57s -> 5289.29s]  Someone's gonna make me a Mugen character.
[5298.63s -> 5299.75s]  Jesus Christ, okay.
[5301.83s -> 5307.90s]  All right, we're almost done with the actions here.
[5307.90s -> 5309.10s]  I don't know, I don't know about this one,
[5309.10s -> 5310.06s]  but this one would do.
[5310.06s -> 5345.80s]  Just let that here, it's still good.
[5345.80s -> 5346.28s]  What?
[5346.28s -> 5347.77s]  Really?
[5347.77s -> 5348.25s]  No way.
[5351.35s -> 5362.39s]  No, that's all right.
[5362.39s -> 5362.71s]  Nice.
[5395.75s -> 5399.45s]  Wait, what happened?
[5399.45s -> 5400.57s]  No, but we're still live.
[5400.57s -> 5402.65s]  I dropped some frames.
[5402.65s -> 5404.33s]  What was the last thing I did?
[5404.33s -> 5410.92s]  Should still be good.
[5410.92s -> 5419.24s]  Okay, did you see the last thing I did?
[5419.24s -> 5422.23s]  No, I dropped like 10 frames, that's fine.
[5422.23s -> 5473.66s]  All right, so here's this one that people have been asking for.
[5473.66s -> 5474.54s]  Fix the framing?
[5474.54s -> 5479.10s]  No, what do you mean fix the framing?
[5479.10s -> 5485.35s]  It's gotta be cropped anyways.
[5485.35s -> 5486.71s]  It has to be pulled back and forth.
[5486.71s -> 5508.12s]  That's gonna stay there.
[5508.12s -> 5517.46s]  Please dab?
[5517.46s -> 5522.94s]  I vetoed dabbing, so I'm definitely not gonna dab.
[5522.94s -> 5534.20s]  This needs to be like over here.
[5534.20s -> 5545.03s]  Why is this doing this?
[5545.03s -> 5545.75s]  Come on, man.
[5545.75s -> 5556.70s]  Give me a break.
[5556.70s -> 5558.06s]  Give me a break.
[5558.06s -> 5578.44s]  Too small?
[5579.90s -> 5581.18s]  I mean, I could move it forward.
[5581.18s -> 5585.91s]  Maybe that'll help a little up there.
[5585.91s -> 5589.85s]  That should be good.
[5589.85s -> 5590.65s]  That should be good.
[5592.98s -> 5594.58s]  Yeah, that's good.
[5594.58s -> 5595.99s]  All right, so what's next?
[5596.63s -> 5605.27s]  It's on a slant.
[5605.27s -> 5608.87s]  It just looks like that because this thing,
[5609.83s -> 5611.98s]  it's actually really annoying actually.
[5611.98s -> 5613.69s]  Hold on.
[5613.69s -> 5615.53s]  Why the fuck is this doing this?
[5615.53s -> 5618.94s]  I wish it wouldn't do that.
[5618.94s -> 5623.80s]  Move the tripod a little.
[5629.21s -> 5630.33s]  It's the tripod.
[5631.90s -> 5632.70s]  I had it before.
[5634.76s -> 5637.72s]  This needs to come up a little bit like this.
[5638.84s -> 5644.36s]  How the fuck does that make any sense?
[5645.16s -> 5660.06s]  It makes no sense because the tripod says it's level.
[5660.62s -> 5662.52s]  I think maybe it's the way it's painted
[5663.16s -> 5665.72s]  because it looks like it's a little bit of an edge
[5665.72s -> 5667.48s]  over here that goes a little further in
[5667.48s -> 5668.12s]  or further out.
[5668.76s -> 5677.22s]  How's that?
[5687.37s -> 5688.57s]  Yeah, I think it just looks like that
[5688.57s -> 5690.33s]  because the way that the ground is over here.
[5693.50s -> 5694.22s]  All right, let's go.
[5704.34s -> 5708.57s]  Uh, so slowly peek into frame.
[5708.57s -> 5709.29s]  How am I going to do this?
[5709.29s -> 5710.65s]  This is going to be fucking hard.
[5710.65s -> 5712.15s]  I'm going to get hurt doing this one,
[5712.15s -> 5713.03s]  so I hope you're ready to see me
[5713.03s -> 5714.39s]  get like actually fucking injured.
[5714.95s -> 5746.28s]  Shut up.
[5754.71s -> 5755.19s]  Belly.
[5756.79s -> 5759.00s]  We saw his belly.
[5778.49s -> 5784.73s]  I'm sorry that I have to do this.
[5821.27s -> 5824.47s]  That was that was one of the most requested things.
[5824.47s -> 5835.46s]  All right, act like I'm shaking hands with somebody.
[5837.77s -> 5838.65s]  I don't know why.
[5838.65s -> 5840.17s]  And then swimming.
[5840.17s -> 5842.17s]  And then it's time to move on to the actual like breathing.
[5842.17s -> 5850.44s]  Good to see you, man.
[5850.44s -> 5852.95s]  So that's a nice firm handshake.
[5853.51s -> 5854.01s]  Okay.
[5856.92s -> 5857.48s]  You let go.
[5858.28s -> 5858.84s]  Thanks, man.
[5858.84s -> 5860.04s]  That's a good handshake you got there.
[5863.21s -> 5863.71s]  Hey.
[5864.33s -> 5865.69s]  Hey, it's been so long.
[5865.69s -> 5866.49s]  Hey, how are you?
[5866.49s -> 5866.99s]  Come on.
[5869.24s -> 5869.74s]  Yes.
[5870.36s -> 5871.23s]  Good to see you.
[5874.44s -> 5875.48s]  Put it there.
[5875.48s -> 5875.98s]  That's it.
[5877.78s -> 5882.09s]  No, it's good to see you, Mike.
[5888.04s -> 5888.54s]  Hey.
[5889.56s -> 5891.08s]  Hey, put it there.
[5891.08s -> 5892.28s]  All right, good to see you.
[5893.08s -> 5908.17s]  I'll give these.
[5908.17s -> 5908.89s]  We'll do it from here.
[5912.94s -> 5913.44s]  Hey.
[5915.14s -> 5916.50s]  Yeah, I'd love to shake your hand.
[5916.50s -> 5917.62s]  Fuck yeah.
[5917.62s -> 5918.98s]  Fuck yeah, man.
[5919.62s -> 5921.54s]  So you still doing that thing?
[5921.54s -> 5924.33s]  You still in school?
[5925.50s -> 5926.94s]  You know, let's do the other one too.
[5926.94s -> 5938.50s]  All right.
[5938.50s -> 5939.00s]  Hey.
[5939.70s -> 5942.98s]  Hey, it's Tim.
[5942.98s -> 5943.86s]  Oh, my God.
[5943.86s -> 5944.66s]  It's good to see you.
[5944.66s -> 5945.30s]  Thanks, man.
[5945.86s -> 5947.14s]  Yeah, it's great to see you again.
[5956.22s -> 5956.72s]  Tim?
[5957.78s -> 5959.14s]  Tim Davidson.
[5959.78s -> 5960.28s]  What?
[5960.44s -> 5961.08s]  Hey, man.
[5962.46s -> 5963.10s]  How are you?
[5965.13s -> 5965.77s]  No shit.
[5966.97s -> 5968.01s]  I got two of my own.
[5969.95s -> 5970.51s]  What's this?
[5971.15s -> 5972.03s]  That's just my new car.
[5973.55s -> 5974.43s]  It's beauty, isn't she?
[5976.43s -> 5977.55s]  I souped her up too.
[5978.75s -> 5979.47s]  V6 engine.
[5980.35s -> 5982.16s]  What do you got back there?
[5983.04s -> 5990.12s]  Not as good as mine, but still worth having in your garage.
[5990.12s -> 5991.47s]  Anyway, it's great.
[5991.47s -> 5992.91s]  That's great that you're doing so well.
[5993.87s -> 5995.95s]  Yeah, I know you gotta go.
[5995.95s -> 5997.07s]  I just caught you.
[5997.87s -> 5998.67s]  Let me get back.
[5998.67s -> 6000.59s]  Let me get into this little thing over here.
[6000.59s -> 6001.07s]  You know what I mean?
[6001.79s -> 6002.91s]  Good to see you again.
[6002.91s -> 6003.41s]  Yeah.
[6003.95s -> 6005.82s]  Take care of yourself, Tim.
[6005.82s -> 6019.00s]  See you later, man.
[6033.92s -> 6034.72s]  I do have a wheel.
[6041.08s -> 6042.04s]  It's a horse.
[6050.51s -> 6052.59s]  There's some serious hydraulics in that car.
[6063.61s -> 6064.74s]  Oh!
[6067.71s -> 6070.46s]  What the fuck?
[6070.46s -> 6070.96s]  Okay.
[6089.60s -> 6092.16s]  That was me getting on a horse.
[6092.72s -> 6094.08s]  I was me on a horse.
[6094.08s -> 6095.12s]  I was on a horse.
[6095.12s -> 6096.24s]  That's a horse.
[6096.24s -> 6098.00s]  That's me on a horse, and that's the thing that you hold.
[6105.95s -> 6106.91s]  Delete the stream.
[6106.91s -> 6108.27s]  Delete the whole stream.
[6108.27s -> 6109.07s]  Delete the stream.
[6109.07s -> 6109.79s]  Delete the stream.
[6110.65s -> 6111.29s]  Delete's over.
[6112.09s -> 6113.05s]  Delete it.
[6113.05s -> 6114.41s]  Delete the stream.
[6119.23s -> 6122.02s]  Delete.
[6122.48s -> 6122.98s]  Don't.
[6124.12s -> 6124.62s]  Nobody.
[6138.94s -> 6139.44s]  Idiots.
[6143.34s -> 6144.62s]  Nobody use that.
[6144.62s -> 6145.58s]  Nobody use that.
[6146.40s -> 6147.52s]  You'll be in big trouble.
[6165.88s -> 6167.08s]  What an old joke.
[6167.72s -> 6169.15s]  Puppet stream.
[6170.24s -> 6171.52s]  I don't even have a sock on.
[6171.52s -> 6173.04s]  Well, I just, whatever.
[6173.04s -> 6174.40s]  All right, we're almost done with the actions.
[6175.90s -> 6177.26s]  I have to swim now.
[6177.26s -> 6181.32s]  Can't you just, like, fuck, can't you just do swimming and...
[6181.32s -> 6184.12s]  Can't swimming and flying be the same thing?
[6184.76s -> 6187.00s]  Well, I guess I was fucking screaming, so that doesn't work.
[6195.52s -> 6197.36s]  This is, this is flying.
[6197.36s -> 6198.48s]  I'm just flying again.
[6242.59s -> 6250.43s]  I trust you.
[6250.43s -> 6251.48s]  How was that?
[6261.07s -> 6262.19s]  He can't swim.
[6263.15s -> 6264.67s]  How does he not know how to swim?
[6264.67s -> 6266.11s]  Just wait, wait, hold on.
[6266.11s -> 6268.91s]  There's more to that.
[6278.52s -> 6302.97s]  That was swimming.
[6302.97s -> 6304.09s]  I'm done with swimming.
[6304.09s -> 6304.97s]  Swimming's done.
[6312.76s -> 6315.08s]  He says, this is a huge great screen.
[6319.12s -> 6320.96s]  Contemplating life choices.
[6326.19s -> 6327.47s]  All right, here we go.
[6327.47s -> 6335.66s]  So here's where we're going to do some reactions.
[6336.22s -> 6340.14s]  We're like just about, we're pretty much more than halfway done.
[6340.14s -> 6342.30s]  Well, actually, there's a lot of, oh my God, there's so much shit.
[6343.02s -> 6348.48s]  We're like 30, 40% of the way done.
[6349.61s -> 6350.57s]  All right, here we go.
[6351.21s -> 6355.56s]  This is what, this is what you waited for.
[6355.56s -> 6356.92s]  So we got all the actions out of the way.
[6356.92s -> 6357.48s]  Now, here we go.
[6357.48s -> 6358.28s]  This is what you wanted.
[6358.28s -> 6370.12s]  Now, this is by far, this is the best part right here.
[6370.12s -> 6371.24s]  This is my favorite part.
[6371.88s -> 6373.37s]  This is the best part.
[6374.91s -> 6375.31s]  Stop talking.
[6375.31s -> 6375.95s]  This is the best part.
[6377.98s -> 6378.30s]  Nice.
[6386.94s -> 6387.74s]  This is terrible.
[6390.09s -> 6391.45s]  Absolutely terrible.
[6393.15s -> 6394.35s]  Nothing about this is good.
[6394.99s -> 6395.79s]  Not one thing.
[6398.64s -> 6399.52s]  God, I hate this.
[6400.75s -> 6401.63s]  I hate this.
[6401.63s -> 6402.43s]  This is terrible.
[6403.07s -> 6409.66s]  What a gamer.
[6411.74s -> 6413.34s]  What a god of a gamer.
[6413.34s -> 6413.82s]  Seriously.
[6427.53s -> 6429.21s]  This is the thing I'm talking about right here.
[6429.85s -> 6431.05s]  I've told you guys this before.
[6432.88s -> 6434.08s]  Absolute perfection.
[6435.39s -> 6436.59s]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[6437.55s -> 6441.47s]  This right here is absolute perfection.
[6455.39s -> 6456.19s]  What a gamer.
[6457.23s -> 6457.87s]  Hold on, hold on.
[6467.50s -> 6470.46s]  Wow, wow.
[6471.10s -> 6473.45s]  This is what it looks like up close.
[6475.32s -> 6478.20s]  From back there, it could have been anything.
[6479.24s -> 6480.36s]  This is perfect.
[6480.36s -> 6482.36s]  It's exactly what I was talking about.
[6482.36s -> 6493.95s]  Turn it up.
[6493.95s -> 6494.99s]  Are you in charge of this?
[6495.80s -> 6496.28s]  Turn it up.
[6497.64s -> 6498.44s]  Get to shut this off.
[6498.44s -> 6499.64s]  Shut them all off.
[6499.64s -> 6501.08s]  Turn your lights in your house off too.
[6501.88s -> 6515.04s]  You really fucking watching this shit?
[6518.22s -> 6521.36s]  Oh, please.
[6523.05s -> 6524.41s]  Oh my god.
[6525.37s -> 6528.44s]  Fucking god.
[6528.44s -> 6528.94s]  Terrible.
[6538.11s -> 6538.61s]  Yeah.
[6540.32s -> 6540.82s]  Yes.
[6541.20s -> 6544.76s]  That's it.
[6565.40s -> 6566.28s]  Okay, so.
[6567.48s -> 6575.93s]  Hold on, I'm going to do this one.
[6575.93s -> 6576.57s]  Whoa.
[6576.57s -> 6585.50s]  So this is the virtual world of the world.
[6585.50s -> 6586.00s]  Cut.
[6586.94s -> 6599.13s]  So this is the virtual world.
[6599.13s -> 6600.17s]  Why can't I say that?
[6603.93s -> 6605.13s]  Virtual world.
[6605.13s -> 6606.17s]  Virtual world.
[6612.17s -> 6612.89s]  Whoa.
[6612.89s -> 6620.67s]  So this is the virtual world.
[6620.67s -> 6624.04s]  It's amazing.
[6631.64s -> 6632.14s]  Fascinating.
[6643.82s -> 6650.30s]  All right.
[6650.30s -> 6653.02s]  Now how am I going to do this?
[6653.02s -> 6656.43s]  I have to get like shot at.
[6661.21s -> 6661.69s]  Time.
[6661.69s -> 6662.01s]  Close.
[6662.57s -> 6666.84s]  I want to keep the actions in the same close though
[6666.84s -> 6669.56s]  because if people are going to be cutting between stuff
[6670.20s -> 6672.52s]  then they kind of need continuity.
[6672.52s -> 6674.84s]  So let me get through like the most of the actions.
[6694.19s -> 6697.50s]  You got me.
[6697.50s -> 6698.06s]  You got me.
[6700.78s -> 6701.28s]  You got me.
[6714.33s -> 6715.53s]  You got me.
[6715.53s -> 6716.25s]  You got me.
[6727.61s -> 6732.00s]  You got me.
[6733.69s -> 6735.45s]  All right, I'm not doing you got me anymore.
[6743.55s -> 6755.58s]  What am I?
[6755.58s -> 6755.98s]  What?
[6755.98s -> 6756.70s]  What a way to die.
[6764.51s -> 6772.30s]  Am I giving birth?
[6788.46s -> 6812.70s]  I have to make the noise, man.
[6812.70s -> 6814.06s]  All right, here we go.
[6814.06s -> 6815.98s]  It's almost time to bring out the props.
[6815.98s -> 6821.29s]  All right, so here we go.
[6822.25s -> 6823.69s]  Hold on, give me one second.
[6832.68s -> 6841.50s]  Camera's too high.
[6841.50s -> 6844.30s]  All right, so where is...
[6847.12s -> 6856.19s]  I don't know why this looks so off.
[6856.19s -> 6859.66s]  Sorry, I just minimized my action list here.
[6859.66s -> 6867.85s]  Okay, so now I need to frantically run around
[6867.85s -> 6869.29s]  as if the building is on fire.
[6878.16s -> 6878.64s]  Oh no.
[6879.28s -> 6880.40s]  Oh no.
[6880.40s -> 6882.60s]  No, no, no, no.
[6884.33s -> 6887.63s]  Oh, oh, it's everywhere.
[6892.09s -> 6901.61s]  Let me fix this shit.
[6901.61s -> 6922.56s]  This next one is sleep and be startled by something.
[6950.44s -> 6967.58s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm up.
[6984.52s -> 6985.88s]  Five more minutes.
[6985.88s -> 6988.28s]  Okay, I'll do it five more minutes.
[6988.28s -> 6990.44s]  Why am I making like jeans and...
[6990.44s -> 6991.80s]  I gotta go like that pajamas.
[6991.80s -> 6992.28s]  Hold on.
[6992.28s -> 6998.12s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6998.12s -> 6999.00s]  Costume change.
[6999.72s -> 7037.42s]  My starboard is pajamas.
[7058.89s -> 7062.38s]  No, no, you do it.
[7063.82s -> 7064.54s]  You do it.
[7067.21s -> 7068.01s]  I'm sleeping.
[7074.20s -> 7075.00s]  Yeah.
[7075.00s -> 7098.32s]  Okay, mom.
[7098.32s -> 7099.44s]  Five more minutes, mom.
[7103.52s -> 7112.96s]  Mom!
[7112.96s -> 7114.00s]  Hey, mom.
[7114.00s -> 7122.38s]  Can I have a glass of water?
[7122.38s -> 7123.02s]  No!
[7125.45s -> 7126.57s]  I'm getting the fuck off.
[7126.57s -> 7134.14s]  I have like a fucking tantrum.
[7134.14s -> 7137.10s]  I'm not having a tantrum on the ground over there at 33.
[7137.10s -> 7145.36s]  Ow!
[7145.36s -> 7153.48s]  No, did I just fuck this up?
[7153.48s -> 7157.79s]  No, we're good.
[7157.79s -> 7158.91s]  No, we're good.
[7158.91s -> 7165.15s]  All right, so now I need my phone back.
[7165.15s -> 7166.03s]  Where the fuck is that?
[7166.03s -> 7168.78s]  Right here.
[7168.78s -> 7170.30s]  I have like a fucking tantrum.
[7176.11s -> 7179.64s]  Uh, so now we're gonna deal with the weather in my pajamas.
[7179.64s -> 7190.75s]  Okay, here we go.
[7190.75s -> 7192.35s]  Like outside with like no shoes on.
[7192.35s -> 7232.00s]  Let's get close.
[7232.00s -> 7265.56s]  All right, here we go.
[7265.56s -> 7266.68s]  Fighting game moves?
[7266.68s -> 7272.33s]  Don't worry, I'm gonna do it.
[7272.33s -> 7273.13s]  Brain.
[7273.13s -> 7289.47s]  Why would you put your hands up?
[7290.20s -> 7297.93s]  Out of the brain in your pajamas.
[7297.93s -> 7302.33s]  All right, so now I got this one.
[7302.33s -> 7321.32s]  If I don't move, it won't see me.
[7321.32s -> 7337.28s]  Costume change.
[7339.58s -> 7341.18s]  Still in PJs.
[7341.18s -> 7349.05s]  Oh, this one's gonna be good.
[7349.05s -> 7353.95s]  This one's gonna be good.
[7353.95s -> 7376.62s]  God damn it.
[7376.62s -> 7379.53s]  Transitioning into...
[7384.54s -> 7386.52s]  Oh, shit.
[7394.28s -> 7395.88s]  Stinging my blood.
[7397.32s -> 7404.81s]  Honey detected.
[7405.45s -> 7412.16s]  Nice costume change.
[7412.16s -> 7413.68s]  I walked off the green screen.
[7413.68s -> 7414.40s]  Fuck.
[7414.40s -> 7417.95s]  All right, you ready?
[7417.95s -> 7422.25s]  Are you ready for me to do prop-related material?
[7422.25s -> 7432.44s]  Here we go.
[7448.65s -> 7450.49s]  I'm gonna look like such a fucking idiot.
[7450.49s -> 7452.57s]  I have three pairs of pants on.
[7452.65s -> 7457.47s]  I have literally three...
[7457.47s -> 7460.59s]  I have jeans, pajamas, and now suit pants on.
[7460.59s -> 7461.07s]  Hope of that.
[7468.70s -> 7470.70s]  I'm gonna look like such a drunk.
[7471.34s -> 7473.26s]  Like my tie's gonna be undone.
[7473.26s -> 7474.78s]  I'm gonna be like a drunk guy at a wedding.
[7475.50s -> 7502.72s]  With like socks.
[7505.66s -> 7508.46s]  Just imagine I just like, I drank like fucking a pint of vodka.
[7509.18s -> 7514.89s]  I don't fucking care about this tie.
[7519.40s -> 7520.60s]  I got a t-shirt on.
[7555.37s -> 7556.33s]  All right.
[7556.33s -> 7557.53s]  Looking good.
[7561.10s -> 7562.46s]  Chip's got a fucking clip on.
[7607.32s -> 7615.45s]  I gotta keep it like that though.
[7615.45s -> 7616.81s]  That's so fucking funny.
[7618.43s -> 7619.39s]  Is either of these zipped up?
[7633.74s -> 7634.78s]  That's right, Diane.
[7634.78s -> 7642.22s]  As you can tell, there's a cold front coming down through California here over Mississippi.
[7642.22s -> 7647.18s]  That's gonna be about 45 degrees cooler than you typically would have out there in the Midwest.
[7648.22s -> 7649.42s]  Put the next slide up, please.
[7655.00s -> 7655.88s]  That's correct, Diane.
[7655.88s -> 7660.20s]  So as you see here, Massachusetts has got a little bit of a hot front coming in.
[7660.20s -> 7662.81s]  Pretty easy what you're looking at here.
[7662.81s -> 7664.89s]  Halloween weekend's gonna be a little bit tough for you there.
[7664.89s -> 7665.69s]  Make sure you bundle up.
[7665.69s -> 7668.81s]  Make sure you get a lot of hats on.
[7668.81s -> 7672.17s]  So next weekend, we've got two, that's right, two...
[7676.92s -> 7678.04s]  Oh my, did the stream die?
[7678.60s -> 7681.76s]  Are we good?
[7686.94s -> 7687.90s]  Are we still fine?
[7699.16s -> 7703.21s]  Good.
[7703.21s -> 7704.09s]  That's right, Diane.
[7704.09s -> 7705.93s]  It's gonna be a cold one this weekend.
[7705.93s -> 7709.85s]  As you can see here, we've got some low pressure coming up through the mountains here,
[7709.85s -> 7713.37s]  going all the way down over southern New Hampshire.
[7713.37s -> 7718.33s]  That's right, it's gonna make its way down here across the Nile River there.
[7718.33s -> 7722.09s]  And then it's gonna wrap back around and come back towards Massachusetts,
[7722.09s -> 7727.77s]  which then, unfortunately, your Saturday football game's gonna get potentially rained out.
[7727.77s -> 7733.77s]  As you see, two, that's right, two cold fronts coming from here and from here.
[7734.49s -> 7736.17s]  And it's gonna be a breezy one.
[7736.17s -> 7739.53s]  They're gonna collide together and they may be a gosh darn tornado.
[7739.53s -> 7743.21s]  So you better bundle up out there and make sure you have anti-tornado clothing on
[7743.21s -> 7746.09s]  and anti-tornado hats because they might blow away.
[7746.09s -> 7746.59s]  Diane?
[7751.56s -> 7752.92s]  I'm not so sure about that one.
[7752.92s -> 7754.60s]  It's gonna be a hot one, that's right.
[7755.40s -> 7757.08s]  It's gonna be a hot one out there, Diane.
[7757.08s -> 7758.92s]  As you can see, look at how big that sun is.
[7759.64s -> 7761.00s]  Look at how big that is.
[7761.00s -> 7762.84s]  I don't even need to tell you temperature numbers.
[7762.84s -> 7764.76s]  That's just a big old sun, ain't it there?
[7765.40s -> 7769.24s]  And it's gonna be shining across the entire U.S. of A, that's right.
[7769.24s -> 7773.00s]  Sun here, sunshine over here, and even sunshine down here,
[7773.00s -> 7776.04s]  where you don't typically get it, if you know what I'm saying.
[7776.04s -> 7777.72s]  So, bundle up out there.
[7777.72s -> 7778.60s]  It's gonna be a cold one.
[7778.60s -> 7780.36s]  Every day's a cold one with the sun out there.
[7782.12s -> 7783.40s]  And Diane, go fuck yourself!
[7791.08s -> 7791.58s]  Wow!
[7799.87s -> 7805.71s]  You know, typically I bring you the weather on a daily basis at 6 a.m.,
[7805.71s -> 7808.91s]  6 a.m. in the morning with Diane, Carol, and Rick.
[7810.59s -> 7812.59s]  But today, I want to show you something different.
[7813.55s -> 7816.27s]  Besides the fact that, first, be aware,
[7816.91s -> 7820.11s]  we are gonna have some snow over here in the Colorado Rockies,
[7820.67s -> 7824.59s]  coming through here, down into the southern part of Colorado.
[7824.59s -> 7826.11s]  But, forget that.
[7826.67s -> 7829.55s]  I want to show you something that I care about.
[7829.55s -> 7831.31s]  Something that I want to show.
[7831.31s -> 7833.95s]  That I haven't been having, I had no opportunity to do it until now.
[7834.83s -> 7839.71s]  That's me on my fishing trip.
[7839.71s -> 7841.72s]  That's me and my son.
[7842.36s -> 7847.26s]  I just wanted to show.
[7851.37s -> 7852.25s]  There we are.
[7852.25s -> 7854.65s]  And back to the weather.
[7855.69s -> 7859.90s]  We do have, like I said, some cold from who cares about this.
[7861.84s -> 7864.56s]  America, go out and live your lives.
[7865.36s -> 7866.88s]  Don't worry about the weather.
[7866.88s -> 7868.80s]  You just go outside and sniff.
[7868.80s -> 7869.76s]  You'll be just fine.
[7870.48s -> 7871.84s]  It's gonna be cold some days.
[7871.84s -> 7873.12s]  It's gonna be hot some days.
[7873.84s -> 7876.08s]  It's just, just go out there.
[7876.08s -> 7878.24s]  Go out there and live.
[7879.84s -> 7895.68s]  Diane, why is the tie three-fourths the size?
[7895.68s -> 7897.36s]  All right, so now, here's another one.
[7897.36s -> 7899.44s]  I have to get the tie off for this one.
[7900.08s -> 7901.23s]  Here's the last one.
[7901.23s -> 7902.11s]  We'll do one more weather.
[7910.97s -> 7912.49s]  Hey, it's me.
[7912.49s -> 7913.53s]  That's right, Diane.
[7913.53s -> 7916.44s]  We got the wacky weather report coming up.
[7916.44s -> 7917.08s]  That was my note.
[7917.08s -> 7920.40s]  So as you see here, it's gonna be, wow,
[7920.40s -> 7922.32s]  it's gonna be breezy tomorrow night.
[7922.32s -> 7924.64s]  So make sure you stay indoors.
[7924.64s -> 7926.00s]  60 mile per hour gusts.
[7926.00s -> 7927.28s]  Be careful out there.
[7927.28s -> 7928.80s]  Whoa, easy.
[7929.36s -> 7932.16s]  Next up, oh, of course, gotta tell you,
[7932.16s -> 7935.12s]  the local pumpkin festival is gonna be canceled
[7935.12s -> 7938.48s]  because, oh no, it's raining outside.
[7940.64s -> 7941.60s]  Back to you, Diane.
[7950.96s -> 7952.56s]  Diane, will you marry me?
[7964.40s -> 7966.16s]  That was just Jim Carrey.
[7972.67s -> 7973.47s]  He looks like he wears...
[7980.51s -> 7981.15s]  That's right.
[7981.87s -> 7982.75s]  Here's the weather.
[7985.88s -> 7990.72s]  Yeah, the roads are gonna be slick.
[7993.98s -> 7997.90s]  Especially on that road there, that one over here.
[8001.02s -> 8003.82s]  I think this is gonna be at least two or three.
[8004.99s -> 8006.73s]  I don't know.
[8006.73s -> 8007.29s]  Just look.
[8007.29s -> 8010.36s]  This is, I think, two or three different weathers
[8010.36s -> 8011.24s]  that are gonna come together
[8011.24s -> 8014.28s]  and find a dual weather scenario.
[8015.24s -> 8018.96s]  No, I don't care.
[8018.96s -> 8020.96s]  Just job.
[8022.01s -> 8024.01s]  I went out last night and I got destroyed.
[8048.72s -> 8049.36s]  All right, here we go.
[8051.64s -> 8053.16s]  Now I have to accept an award.
[8056.32s -> 8075.53s]  No tie for this one.
[8075.53s -> 8076.33s]  Nice.
[8076.41s -> 8078.65s]  Right, thank you.
[8079.37s -> 8092.80s]  Well, thanks everybody.
[8093.60s -> 8099.87s]  I just wanna say, being the number one streamer on Twitch,
[8100.84s -> 8102.92s]  it was a dream come true.
[8102.92s -> 8104.04s]  No, I never thought I would be here.
[8104.04s -> 8106.68s]  I never thought I would get to the stage in my life
[8106.68s -> 8108.20s]  where I was the number one most viewed,
[8108.20s -> 8110.28s]  number one most subscribed, number one most watched.
[8111.16s -> 8112.52s]  We're bigger than ESPN now.
[8112.52s -> 8114.92s]  So, I mean, right, yep.
[8115.88s -> 8116.44s]  That's a fan.
[8116.44s -> 8117.48s]  That's a fan up there, guys.
[8120.67s -> 8122.51s]  So, it's ridiculous that now
[8123.07s -> 8124.35s]  I'm able to buy Disney,
[8125.15s -> 8126.91s]  which I never thought I'd be able to do.
[8126.91s -> 8129.07s]  I swear to God, I'm gonna make the incredible stream.
[8129.07s -> 8129.31s]  Yep.
[8130.11s -> 8132.59s]  So, thank you everybody so much for all that you've done.
[8133.47s -> 8133.71s]  Yep.
[8134.35s -> 8134.99s]  We made it.
[8134.99s -> 8135.39s]  We did it.
[8136.84s -> 8139.95s]  Well, oh, I did.
[8142.27s -> 8142.67s]  I did.
[8143.61s -> 8144.73s]  But, yeah.
[8145.37s -> 8146.33s]  Yeah, thank you.
[8147.66s -> 8151.58s]  I'll see you all, hey, Tuesdays and Thursdays and Fridays.
[8151.58s -> 8153.32s]  What's that?
[8155.74s -> 8158.65s]  Yeah, okay.
[8159.42s -> 8164.76s]  No, yeah, well, I'm not gonna play Minecraft.
[8164.76s -> 8166.04s]  Thanks for the enthusiasm.
[8167.24s -> 8170.20s]  I will see you guys real soon, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
[8170.20s -> 8170.84s]  Much love to you.
[8170.84s -> 8171.88s]  Thank you for this award.
[8171.88s -> 8172.60s]  Thank you for this.
[8173.96s -> 8174.92s]  You guys are amazing.
[8174.92s -> 8175.32s]  Thank you.
[8177.72s -> 8190.54s]  All right, one more of these.
[8202.57s -> 8202.97s]  Got it.
[8203.53s -> 8203.85s]  Yes.
[8206.22s -> 8208.54s]  All right.
[8208.54s -> 8208.94s]  Wow.
[8210.64s -> 8210.96s]  Whoa.
[8211.76s -> 8214.40s]  I never thought that I would be winning this award.
[8215.55s -> 8217.28s]  Unbelievable.
[8217.28s -> 8218.00s]  Let me just say,
[8218.72s -> 8223.44s]  from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all of your support
[8224.24s -> 8226.88s]  and for all of your wonderful contributions.
[8228.12s -> 8230.68s]  I must say, it's been quite a year.
[8232.46s -> 8236.54s]  Quite a year, in fact, that I've got two more games to announce.
[8237.34s -> 8237.90s]  That's right.
[8238.78s -> 8239.66s]  Two more games.
[8240.94s -> 8245.66s]  With the most ingenuity and the highest caliber of skill
[8245.66s -> 8248.80s]  that any of our developers have ever done,
[8248.88s -> 8253.36s]  it is my pleasure to announce our latest title.
[8264.97s -> 8270.68s]  Never before has there ever been quite a scenario like this one.
[8273.31s -> 8276.89s]  Diablo Immortal is nothing to do with me.
[8277.45s -> 8283.08s]  I'm not gonna make a Blizzard reference because I have nothing to do.
[8283.08s -> 8284.36s]  I have a different game to show you.
[8284.92s -> 8285.98s]  Here it is.
[8288.49s -> 8289.77s]  I can't go down that road.
[8290.57s -> 8299.39s]  That's right.
[8300.73s -> 8301.23s]  Hey.
[8302.41s -> 8302.91s]  Hey.
[8303.53s -> 8305.48s]  Are there any gamers in here?
[8307.15s -> 8307.65s]  Of course there is.
[8310.70s -> 8312.14s]  Got quite a lineup this year.
[8313.36s -> 8318.64s]  Last year we saw some of the best games highly reviewed
[8318.64s -> 8321.71s]  that we've ever had as a company here.
[8321.71s -> 8322.67s]  We have you all to thank.
[8324.44s -> 8329.16s]  Our average Metacritic score reached over 58.
[8333.88s -> 8340.12s]  And I find it completely necessary to now show you, the fans,
[8341.16s -> 8345.32s]  a brand new experience that you won't have anywhere else.
[8347.04s -> 8351.28s]  We're talking about complete open world, complete open environment,
[8352.16s -> 8355.04s]  and complete and total control over your surroundings.
[8357.60s -> 8358.10s]  Yeah.
[8358.94s -> 8359.90s]  You knew it was coming.
[8361.08s -> 8362.36s]  But were you ready for this?
[8363.77s -> 8368.33s]  I present to you, made with me and my wife and our three kids,
[8372.68s -> 8373.40s]  World Zone.
[8382.33s -> 8382.81s]  There we go.
[8382.81s -> 8383.31s]  Okay.
[8384.83s -> 8396.83s]  World Zone is a PVP-inspired top-down FPS hyphen strategy game.
[8399.23s -> 8400.59s]  Here's some gameplay footage of it now.
[8404.27s -> 8410.19s]  You'll get this in your hands as soon as Monday.
[8411.15s -> 8411.79s]  Monday.
[8411.79s -> 8413.55s]  Like I'm talking about tomorrow.
[8413.55s -> 8414.35s]  You understand?
[8414.35s -> 8415.79s]  You're going to get this game on Monday.
[8416.96s -> 8417.84s]  Monday.
[8417.84s -> 8418.48s]  Monday.
[8418.48s -> 8418.96s]  Monday.
[8418.96s -> 8420.96s]  You're going to get this game on Monday.
[8425.42s -> 8426.22s]  This Monday.
[8426.94s -> 8429.41s]  And that's my time.
[8430.21s -> 8431.33s]  Get your hands on it Monday.
[8431.97s -> 8434.24s]  Have a great rest of your conference.
[8444.21s -> 8445.73s]  Tell them about the shoes.
[8464.30s -> 8464.80s]  Whatever.
[8469.36s -> 8471.36s]  No, I'm not redoing it with shoes on.
[8475.76s -> 8476.26s]  All right.
[8482.82s -> 8484.26s]  Now I'm going to bring in a couple of props.
[8484.82s -> 8489.79s]  This is a baseball.
[8491.49s -> 8493.17s]  I'm soxing this one too.
[8538.13s -> 8549.31s]  There it goes.
[8549.31s -> 8550.59s]  Here's what I have to say about this.
[8552.03s -> 8552.91s]  See this bullshit?
[8553.47s -> 8564.64s]  Get out of here.
[8564.64s -> 8566.70s]  No, no, no, no.
[8566.70s -> 8567.50s]  Turn it up.
[8567.50s -> 8568.54s]  Turn it up.
[8568.54s -> 8570.08s]  Turn it up.
[8570.08s -> 8570.96s]  Turn it up.
[8570.96s -> 8576.02s]  I saved the world right here.
[8576.02s -> 8577.06s]  I just saved the world.
[8609.34s -> 8611.26s]  Don't destroy the green screen.
[8611.26s -> 8613.66s]  All right, hold on.
[8632.74s -> 8635.22s]  This was an incredibly highly requested thing.
[8635.22s -> 8636.74s]  And I don't know why, but you'll see.
[8762.45s -> 8766.69s]  He's getting into it.
[8766.69s -> 8768.42s]  Open it up.
[8768.42s -> 8772.90s]  Open it up.
[8772.90s -> 8774.02s]  Nobody asked for that.
[8774.02s -> 8776.10s]  That was like one of the top requested things.
[8785.73s -> 8787.81s]  I'm not putting the suit on and doing that.
[8787.81s -> 8793.90s]  This one was highly requested too.
[8793.90s -> 8794.62s]  Here, let me get it.
[8794.62s -> 8842.02s]  That's a little too high.
[8842.02s -> 8848.13s]  Is your ladder this?
[8848.13s -> 8851.26s]  Somebody monitor the driving.
[8851.90s -> 8853.73s]  Here's the lab boat wheel.
[8909.79s -> 8910.59s]  God.
[8910.59s -> 8939.74s]  Every various driving sequences.
[8940.54s -> 8945.14s]  Do it over the shoulder.
[8945.14s -> 8946.67s]  I mean like this.
[8957.34s -> 8957.84s]  Jesus.
[8961.49s -> 8962.21s]  Yeah.

[9034.23s -> 9034.87s]  Yeah.
[9034.87s -> 9040.82s]  No, I've been driving for like probably a couple of years now on Lyft.

[9106.77s -> 9110.20s]  Can you relax back there, please?
[9110.92s -> 9114.92s]  This is what you're doing is incredibly distracting.
[9114.92s -> 9115.24s]  That's all.
[9117.86s -> 9119.46s]  I'll get you out of the car if you don't.
[9125.33s -> 9125.81s]  Jesus.
[9126.45s -> 9128.80s]  Did you see that?

[9862.20s -> 10002.48s]  Oh shit, zombies, zombies.
[10002.48s -> 10020.16s]  No, forget about the zombies.
[10020.16s -> 10020.88s]  You got it.
[10020.88s -> 10023.44s]  Here we go.
[10023.44s -> 10023.92s]  Let's have this.
[10058.45s -> 10063.68s]  Oh, did I get him?
[10063.68s -> 10095.20s]  I know I got him.
[10095.20s -> 10095.52s]  Sure.
[10095.52s -> 10109.60s]  Oh, new shirt going on.
[10109.60s -> 10122.90s]  I'm going to regret this.
[10123.46s -> 10125.25s]  All right.
[10125.25s -> 10128.45s]  So you guys tell me, you think I'm going to regret this more than I regret already
[10128.45s -> 10129.09s]  the dinosaur?
[10175.70s -> 10207.88s]  Oh, it was a clean bar.
[10214.18s -> 10222.42s]  Delete that one, too.
[10222.42s -> 10226.31s]  I want you to delete that whole thing.
[10226.31s -> 10241.03s]  That's got to be the biggest.
[10241.03s -> 10242.87s]  That's going to be the biggest bane I've ever seen.
[10243.51s -> 10245.38s]  Good thing I got this.
[10253.73s -> 10255.33s]  Sell that to a merchant.
[10255.33s -> 10262.80s]  Do you think I'll be able to get it with this?
[10262.80s -> 10271.11s]  I'll try just barely.
[10271.11s -> 10271.91s]  One more.
[10271.91s -> 10275.34s]  All right.
[10277.86s -> 10278.10s]  Nice.
[10282.63s -> 10283.03s]  Throw it.
[10287.24s -> 10298.36s]  You guys mind if I mine here?
[10298.36s -> 10311.72s]  Not a big deal, dude.
[10311.72s -> 10320.21s]  I mean, this is my house.
[10320.21s -> 10322.52s]  And it's much better than yours.
[10322.52s -> 10333.93s]  Well, I do get a pretty sweet house.
[10333.93s -> 10336.93s]  Way better than your Minecraft house, dude.
[10336.93s -> 10359.04s]  What's that?
[10359.04s -> 10360.21s]  Oh, you like!
[10360.21s -> 10363.58s]  You like what I have here, don't you?
[10363.58s -> 10364.82s]  Yeah.
[10364.82s -> 10367.19s]  Well, how do you think I made it?
[10367.19s -> 10384.60s]  You're in my garage.
[10385.16s -> 10437.22s]  Is he taking requests?
[10437.22s -> 10438.22s]  Yes.
[10438.22s -> 10444.06s]  When I'm done with all the ones that I want to do, he'll take requests.
[10444.06s -> 10447.68s]  Oh my god, this looks like shit.
[10447.68s -> 10463.72s]  And don't forget about me, the newest turtle, Socrates.
[10463.72s -> 10470.31s]  I may be small, but I sure got lots of power.
[10470.31s -> 10487.50s]  And don't forget about me, the newest turtle, Socrates.
[10487.50s -> 10492.50s]  With my trusty curved blade, I slash those putties like nobody's business.
[10493.06s -> 10494.06s]  Check me out.
[10494.06s -> 10497.06s]  You'll see a little bit of footage right here.
[10497.06s -> 10522.92s]  That's right, Donatello.
[10522.92s -> 10524.92s]  And we should all eat our vegetables.
[10524.92s -> 10532.40s]  Like, ah!
[10532.40s -> 10538.38s]  That's right, Donatello.
[10538.38s -> 10539.38s]  And another thing.
[10539.38s -> 10541.38s]  Eat your vegetables and fruits, too.
[10541.38s -> 10543.38s]  They make you grow up big and strong like us turtles.
[10543.38s -> 10550.36s]  Like me, Leonardo.
[10550.36s -> 10551.36s]  Just stuff like that.
[10551.36s -> 10557.37s]  When you're older.
[10557.37s -> 10559.37s]  Not a great example.
[10559.37s -> 10593.00s]  There's too many of them.
[10593.00s -> 10602.32s]  There's too many of them.
[10602.88s -> 10654.84s]  Princess Bride?
[10654.84s -> 10662.64s]  God damn it.
[10662.64s -> 10668.21s]  I did the same thing I just did again.
[10668.21s -> 10679.03s]  Here's the only difference.
[10679.03s -> 10680.03s]  I can't wear this.
[10680.03s -> 10707.93s]  I look like a fucking idiot.
[10707.93s -> 10720.03s]  This is made for a kid.
[10720.03s -> 10722.46s]  This is supposed to be down here.
[10722.46s -> 10724.46s]  This is made for like a fucking seven year old.
[10724.46s -> 10737.82s]  I'm in like an X-wing.
[10737.82s -> 10742.75s]  Fighter One, what's your status?
[10742.75s -> 10744.75s]  That's right, let's take it to them hot guys.
[10744.75s -> 10749.12s]  Come on.
[10749.12s -> 10753.56s]  Watch your six.
[10753.56s -> 10754.56s]  Ah, I can't see him.
[10754.56s -> 10755.56s]  I can't get him.
[10755.56s -> 10764.10s]  I can't get him.
[10764.10s -> 10765.10s]  I can't see him.
[10765.66s -> 10768.73s]  That is a negative here, man.
[10768.73s -> 10772.73s]  Hey, maybe you can get us a few rounds when we're done with this.
[10772.73s -> 10777.49s]  You know what I'm saying?
[10777.49s -> 10778.49s]  Watch out.
[10778.49s -> 10779.49s]  Watch out.
[10779.49s -> 10780.86s]  TIE fighters.
[10780.86s -> 10781.86s]  TIE fighters coming in.
[10781.86s -> 10784.51s]  Left side.
[10784.51s -> 10785.51s]  Right side.
[10785.51s -> 10786.51s]  Got him.
[10786.51s -> 10790.18s]  Got him.
[10790.18s -> 10791.18s]  Watch your tail there.
[10791.18s -> 10795.88s]  I'm right behind you.
[10795.88s -> 10797.37s]  Yeah!
[10797.37s -> 10798.37s]  Yeah!
[10798.37s -> 10799.37s]  I'm going down.
[10799.37s -> 10800.37s]  No, I'm going down.
[10800.37s -> 10801.37s]  I'm going down.
[10801.37s -> 10802.37s]  This is Fighter One.
[10802.37s -> 10803.93s]  I'm going down.
[10803.93s -> 10804.93s]  Fighter One going down.
[10804.93s -> 10808.22s]  Mayday!
[10808.22s -> 10843.81s]  No, I'm going to need it here.
[10849.99s -> 10858.50s]  This is the strangest plan I think I've ever been to.
[10858.50s -> 10861.60s]  Don't start with me here.
[10861.60s -> 10863.60s]  I am a pilot, but I'm also a Jedi too.
[10863.60s -> 10891.61s]  Can you hit that shit?
[10891.61s -> 10893.61s]  I can't take this.
[10893.61s -> 10905.26s]  Why would I take it serious?
[10905.26s -> 10907.26s]  I'm trying to close it.
[10907.26s -> 10918.32s]  It won't close.
[10918.32s -> 10932.33s]  Man, I already broke it.
[10932.33s -> 10934.66s]  Ah!
[10934.66s -> 10943.71s]  I don't think I can do it.
[10943.71s -> 10953.46s]  Let's try this again.
[10953.46s -> 10963.02s]  Really.
[10963.02s -> 10964.02s]  I just have to let you know.
[10964.02s -> 10970.08s]  You strike me down now, and I will become so much stronger than you.
[10970.64s -> 10973.64s]  I'll be at least a full tier up on a fighting game list than you.
[10973.64s -> 11015.77s]  And that was just me showing off.
[11015.77s -> 11052.06s]  It's time for the real fight.
[11052.06s -> 11053.06s]  Easy for you to say.
[11053.06s -> 11057.63s]  You're an evil Sith, but not me.
[11057.63s -> 11065.12s]  I'm a Jedi.
[11065.12s -> 11067.83s]  Oh!
[11067.83s -> 11068.83s]  Please don't kill me.
[11068.83s -> 11069.83s]  Please don't kill me.
[11069.83s -> 11071.13s]  Please.
[11071.13s -> 11073.44s]  I'll be a Sith.
[11073.44s -> 11075.44s]  I will join the Sith right now.
[11075.44s -> 11077.68s]  I'll just join the Sith.
[11077.68s -> 11083.72s]  I pledge allegiance to be a Sith for the United States of America.
[11084.28s -> 11087.28s]  And to not the Republic, but to the Imperial for which you stand, the employer of the Empire,
[11087.28s -> 11093.44s]  one nation under, Dark Vader.
[11093.44s -> 11096.73s]  Ah!
[11096.73s -> 11123.76s]  Ah!
[11123.76s -> 11145.40s]  Two more Star Wars.
[11145.40s -> 11148.40s]  Why is he spending so much time on Star Wars?
[11148.40s -> 11160.92s]  Even the darkest Star Wars fantasies.
[11160.92s -> 11166.01s]  How could you possibly make this into a clip?
[11166.01s -> 11171.01s]  I'm just acting out a fake scene that doesn't exist.
[11171.01s -> 11180.59s]  I just made up a scene that is not a scene in any movie.
[11181.15s -> 11185.08s]  Good luck.
[11185.08s -> 11188.57s]  I'll just do like standard lightsaber shit.
[11188.57s -> 11195.01s]  What the fuck was that?
[11195.01s -> 11200.01s]  I'm like fucking exhausted right now.
[11200.01s -> 11204.28s]  I've been going nonstop with this for three hours.
[11204.28s -> 11206.28s]  I've been drinking toilet water.
[11206.28s -> 11208.28s]  I've been drinking toilet water.
[11208.28s -> 11210.60s]  From the toilet.
[11210.60s -> 11212.60s]  From the toilet, by the way.
[11212.60s -> 11249.15s]  I just did this.
[11249.15s -> 11250.15s]  I just did this.
[11250.15s -> 11251.15s]  All right, that's it.
[11251.15s -> 11252.15s]  We're moving away from Star Wars.
[11252.15s -> 11253.15s]  I'm done with Star Wars.
[11253.71s -> 11277.79s]  Hi, I'm Jerma985, and you're watching the Disney Channel.
[11277.79s -> 11293.61s]  Hey, it's me, Jerma985, and you're watching the Disney Channel.
[11293.61s -> 11326.89s]  Hey, it's me, Jerma, and you're watching the Disney Channel.
[11326.89s -> 11332.89s]  Hey, it's me, Jerma, from the downtown of Center Sports.
[11332.89s -> 11334.89s]  You're watching the Disney Channel.
[11334.89s -> 11359.00s]  I'm already not from Disney.
[11359.00s -> 11371.16s]  Hey, it's Jerma from Jerma985, and you're watching Jerma985.
[11371.72s -> 11376.48s]  Oh, I hated that one.
[11376.48s -> 11379.36s]  I'm doing it again.
[11379.36s -> 11380.36s]  Expelliarmus!
[11380.36s -> 11386.13s]  Hey, it's Jerma from Jerma985, and you're watching...
[11386.13s -> 11387.13s]  Expelliarmus!
[11387.13s -> 11397.99s]  Hey, you know, this thing!
[11397.99s -> 11400.99s]  That thing, da-da-da-da!
[11416.67s -> 11423.35s]  Hey, what's going on?
[11423.35s -> 11427.35s]  It's Jerma from Jerma985, and you're watching Jerma985.
[11427.35s -> 11430.76s]  No.
[11430.76s -> 11450.63s]  All right.
[11450.63s -> 11462.09s]  Hey, dude.
[11462.09s -> 11463.52s]  Hey, dude.
[11463.52s -> 11464.70s]  Hey.
[11464.70s -> 11474.56s]  Do you think I can reach?
[11475.12s -> 11476.74s]  Oh!
[11476.74s -> 11499.16s]  Oh, fuck!
[11499.16s -> 11500.85s]  Shut up, dude!
[11500.85s -> 11501.85s]  Shut the fuck up!
[11501.85s -> 11504.95s]  We're gonna get caught!
[11504.95s -> 11522.57s]  As you can see, I'm not very good at this.
[11522.57s -> 11523.57s]  Oh, I forgot about this one.
[11523.57s -> 11525.32s]  I forgot to put this on.
[11525.32s -> 11528.95s]  This is the one where I have to pretend I'm a toy from Toy Story.
[11528.95s -> 11556.56s]  Yeah!
[11556.56s -> 11558.44s]  Yeah!
[11558.44s -> 11581.48s]  It's a chance at spawning a Gmod rag doll.
[11581.48s -> 11582.84s]  All right, what's left?
[11582.84s -> 11583.84s]  Oh, god damn it.
[11583.84s -> 11585.28s]  I don't even have...
[11585.28s -> 11586.28s]  Oh, come on.
[11586.28s -> 11588.86s]  Get this one out of the way.
[11588.86s -> 11589.86s]  Can you see?
[11589.86s -> 11609.60s]  Oh, god.
[11609.60s -> 11614.61s]  Look!
[11614.61s -> 11618.35s]  Look!
[11618.35s -> 11619.52s]  That's fucked up.
[11620.08s -> 11643.08s]  Look.
[11643.08s -> 11644.08s]  Is that what that is?
[11644.08s -> 11689.24s]  That is a weird, weird image there.
[11689.24s -> 11690.24s]  Get the string off!
[11690.24s -> 11713.18s]  Is there like a...
[11713.18s -> 11714.18s]  That's like Gears of War, right?
[11714.18s -> 11715.18s]  That's like Gears of War shit, isn't it?
[11715.18s -> 11716.18s]  Just put like a chainsaw sound in here.
[11716.18s -> 11718.70s]  Sure.
[11718.70s -> 11719.70s]  All right.
[11719.70s -> 11731.56s]  I gotta look at my list, because I think there's only like three or four things
[11731.56s -> 11732.56s]  left to do.
[11732.56s -> 11733.56s]  Do the meme shit.
[11733.56s -> 11739.73s]  And that's gonna be it.
[11739.73s -> 11740.91s]  He looks like Mark Zuckerberg.
[11740.91s -> 11741.91s]  Okay, man.
[11741.91s -> 11742.91s]  So, here's the new, uh, here's the new phone.
[11742.91s -> 11743.91s]  Is that what he does?
[11743.91s -> 11744.91s]  What does he do?
[11744.91s -> 11746.72s]  Here's the new phone, dude.
[11746.72s -> 11747.72s]  All right, it's time for meme shit.
[11747.72s -> 11748.72s]  So, here's the new phone.
[11748.72s -> 11749.72s]  Wait, Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook now?
[11749.72s -> 11750.72s]  Well, I was gonna say like...
[11750.72s -> 11753.12s]  What?
[11753.12s -> 11754.12s]  What?
[11754.12s -> 11757.08s]  What?
[11757.08s -> 11758.08s]  What?
[11758.08s -> 11759.08s]  What?
[11759.08s -> 11760.64s]  What?
[11760.64s -> 11761.64s]  What?
[11761.64s -> 11762.64s]  What?
[11762.64s -> 11764.33s]  What?
[11764.33s -> 11765.33s]  What?
[11765.33s -> 11768.75s]  What?
[11768.75s -> 11769.75s]  What?
[11769.75s -> 11774.25s]  What?
[11774.25s -> 11775.25s]  What?
[11775.25s -> 11780.33s]  What?
[11780.33s -> 11784.39s]  What?
[11784.39s -> 11785.39s]  What?
[11785.39s -> 11786.39s]  What?
[11792.62s -> 11793.62s]  Why was I like...
[11794.62s -> 11795.62s]  Why was I like an Apple?
[11795.62s -> 11796.62s]  What does that have to do with anything?
[11796.62s -> 11801.70s]  Pretend to pull a lever?
[11801.70s -> 11803.07s]  You got it.
[11803.07s -> 11813.33s]  Oh!
[11813.33s -> 11817.26s]  I didn't do it.
[11817.26s -> 11827.78s]  All right, let me look at my list.
[11827.78s -> 11846.36s]  There's probably not much more.
[11846.36s -> 11847.36s]  Um, perform CPR.
[11847.36s -> 11848.36s]  But on what, though?
[11848.36s -> 11854.34s]  Oh, I need to do this.
[11854.34s -> 11855.34s]  I forgot.
[11855.34s -> 11862.43s]  It's a different green though.
[11862.43s -> 11871.48s]  Stupefy!
[11871.48s -> 11872.48s]  Stupefy!
[11872.48s -> 11888.35s]  We have to get out of here!
[11888.35s -> 11890.36s]  Expelliarmus!
[11890.36s -> 11891.36s]  Expelliarmus!
[11891.36s -> 11894.07s]  Quick!
[11894.07s -> 11895.44s]  Hagrid!
[11895.44s -> 11897.06s]  Gedondo!
[11897.06s -> 11898.06s]  Be right back!
[11898.06s -> 11899.06s]  Get out of here!
[11899.06s -> 11912.84s]  Are they gone?
[11912.84s -> 11924.50s]  Get out of here!
[11924.50s -> 11925.50s]  Stupefy!
[11925.50s -> 11927.76s]  Stupefy!
[11927.76s -> 11928.76s]  Stupefy!
[11928.76s -> 11929.76s]  I had to do that at least once.
[11929.76s -> 11937.60s]  Oh, I need to do this.
[11937.60s -> 11938.60s]  This is going to be hard.
[11938.60s -> 11945.92s]  This is not going to work.
[11945.92s -> 11951.57s]  It's not going to work.
[11951.57s -> 11961.96s]  This needs like a green mask.
[11961.96s -> 11962.96s]  I can probably do this.
[11962.96s -> 11966.89s]  Two different greens.
[11966.89s -> 11984.96s]  This is wearing a dress.
[11984.96s -> 11985.96s]  I'm just wearing a dress.
[11985.96s -> 11992.20s]  Frieza versus Goku.
[11992.20s -> 12001.82s]  I already did all my Spirit Bomb.
[12001.82s -> 12014.07s]  Let me try it again.
[12014.07s -> 12015.07s]  Somebody really wanted this.
[12015.07s -> 12018.68s]  I'll try and get it there.
[12018.68s -> 12019.68s]  Nope.
[12019.68s -> 12026.04s]  That ain't going to work.
[12026.04s -> 12027.04s]  Oh!
[12027.04s -> 12028.04s]  Oh!
[12028.04s -> 12029.04s]  I can't get up.
[12029.04s -> 12031.49s]  I'm stuck in here.
[12031.49s -> 12033.69s]  Actually, I'm stuck in my shirt.
[12033.69s -> 12034.69s]  I don't look like such a dickhead.
[12034.69s -> 12035.69s]  No.
[12035.69s -> 12047.94s]  All right.
[12047.94s -> 12048.94s]  Let's move on to some meme shit.
[12048.94s -> 12068.68s]  Start with this one.
[12068.68s -> 12079.50s]  Here we go.
[12079.50s -> 12080.50s]  If two of the handlers were one in the bush, it looks like this is going to
[12080.50s -> 12087.31s]  be the end.
[12087.31s -> 12089.06s]  This is going to be the end.
[12089.06s -> 12090.06s]  This is going to be the end.
[12090.06s -> 12091.06s]  This is going to be the end.
[12091.06s -> 12092.36s]  This is going to be the end.
[12092.36s -> 12093.36s]  This is going to be the end.
[12093.36s -> 12097.23s]  This is going to be the end.
[12097.23s -> 12099.56s]  This is going to be the end.
[12099.56s -> 12100.56s]  This is going to be the end.
[12100.56s -> 12103.01s]  This is going to be the end.
[12103.01s -> 12116.16s]  This is going to be the end.
[12116.16s -> 12124.44s]  This is going to be the end.
[12124.44s -> 12130.28s]  This is going to be the end.
[12130.28s -> 12131.28s]  This is going to be the end.
[12131.28s -> 12132.28s]  This is going to be the end.
[12132.28s -> 12134.36s]  This is going to be the end.
[12134.36s -> 12135.36s]  This is going to be the end.
[12135.36s -> 12136.36s]  This is going to be the end.
[12136.36s -> 12146.75s]  This is going to be the end.
[12146.75s -> 12147.75s]  This is going to be the end.
[12147.75s -> 12149.24s]  This is going to be the end.
[12149.24s -> 12158.48s]  This is going to be the end.
[12158.48s -> 12159.48s]  This is going to be the end.
[12159.48s -> 12160.48s]  This is going to be the end.
[12160.48s -> 12161.48s]  This is going to be the end.
[12161.48s -> 12163.43s]  This is going to be the end.
[12163.43s -> 12164.43s]  It's gone.
[12164.43s -> 12167.59s]  Knock, knock.
[12167.59s -> 12172.86s]  Who's there?
[12172.86s -> 12173.86s]  Aren't you glad I didn't say banana?
[12173.86s -> 12182.97s]  Put this guy in a body bag.
[12182.97s -> 12184.60s]  He's dead.
[12184.60s -> 12187.95s]  Well, well, I mean, they do say it's got to be five o'clock somewhere.
[12187.95s -> 12188.95s]  Oh, yeah!
[12188.95s -> 12191.92s]  Well, it's got to be five o'clock somewhere, as my professor told me.
[12191.92s -> 12192.92s]  It's high in noon somewhere.
[12192.92s -> 12193.92s]  Yeah, that's too bad.
[12193.92s -> 12202.77s]  But they do say it's got to be five o'clock somewhere, as my professor told me.
[12202.77s -> 12203.77s]  It's high in noon somewhere.
[12203.77s -> 12205.40s]  Yeah, that's too bad.
[12205.40s -> 12207.85s]  But they do say it's got to be five o'clock somewhere, as my professor told me.
[12207.85s -> 12208.85s]  It's high in noon somewhere.
[12208.85s -> 12209.85s]  Yeah, that's too bad.
[12209.85s -> 12210.85s]  But they do say it's got to be five o'clock somewhere, as my professor told me.
[12242.12s -> 12258.53s]  It's high in noon somewhere.
[12258.53s -> 12259.53s]  Stop going off screen, Mr. Green.
[12259.53s -> 12263.01s]  Last one.
[12263.01s -> 12264.01s]  You know, they say the stars align for this wine.
[12264.01s -> 12273.25s]  So, what do we got here?
[12273.25s -> 12279.23s]  Two.
[12279.23s -> 12280.23s]  We know what they say.
[12280.23s -> 12282.88s]  Two is more than one.
[12282.88s -> 12293.52s]  All right, that's one.
[12293.52s -> 12294.52s]  Next up is...
[12294.52s -> 12297.94s]  Oh, what was the other meme shit?
[12297.94s -> 12300.65s]  It was Jojo poses.
[12300.65s -> 12302.15s]  I don't even have any idea what the fuck.
[12302.15s -> 12303.15s]  What was the other one?
[12303.15s -> 12306.05s]  What was the other meme one?
[12306.05s -> 12319.71s]  Oh, okay, right.
[12319.71s -> 12323.32s]  What was the other meme one?
[12323.32s -> 12324.32s]  Oh, okay, right.
[12324.32s -> 12326.64s]  What was the other meme one?
[12326.64s -> 12327.64s]  Oh, okay, right.
[12327.64s -> 12328.64s]  What was the other meme one?
[12328.64s -> 12329.64s]  Oh, okay, right.
[12329.64s -> 12331.78s]  What was the other meme one?
[12331.78s -> 12332.78s]  Oh, okay, right.
[12332.78s -> 12333.78s]  What was the other meme one?
[12333.78s -> 12335.72s]  What was the other one?
[12335.72s -> 12339.18s]  What was the other meme one?
[12339.18s -> 12352.45s]  Oh, okay, right, right.
[12352.45s -> 12353.45s]  It was the snaps.
[12353.45s -> 12358.48s]  All right, so I need...
[12358.48s -> 12362.07s]  Spoilers for Infinity War.
[12362.07s -> 12365.07s]  If you haven't seen it yet, you have.
[12365.07s -> 12366.07s]  You've fucking seen Infinity War.
[12366.07s -> 12369.07s]  There's nobody in this chat that has not seen Infinity War.
[12369.07s -> 12372.07s]  Not one of you has not seen it.
[12372.07s -> 12375.07s]  But mute for the next 45 minutes.
[12387.15s -> 12399.72s]  Are you sure?
[12399.72s -> 12421.16s]  I don't even have an Infinity Gauntlet on.
[12421.16s -> 12428.75s]  It's like I'm just a guy.
[12428.75s -> 12441.98s]  You should have gone for the head.
[12441.98s -> 12447.42s]  And because of this, I'm going to do it with two hands.
[12447.42s -> 12449.42s]  And everyone dies.
[12449.42s -> 12453.22s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[12453.22s -> 12454.22s]  That means me, too.
[12454.22s -> 12455.22s]  No, wait, wait, wait.
[12455.22s -> 12456.22s]  No, that means me.
[12456.22s -> 12457.22s]  No, no, no.
[12457.22s -> 12458.22s]  I didn't not take it back.
[12458.22s -> 12459.22s]  Hey, Mr. Stark.
[12459.22s -> 12469.91s]  I don't feel so good.
[12469.91s -> 12471.91s]  Oh, there I go.
[12471.91s -> 12478.65s]  No, no, no.
[12478.65s -> 12485.59s]  Please, please, Mr. Stark.
[12485.59s -> 12486.59s]  Please, Mr. Stark.
[12486.59s -> 12500.28s]  I don't feel so good.
[12500.28s -> 12501.59s]  I don't feel so good.
[12501.59s -> 12509.27s]  I don't feel so good about this.
[12509.27s -> 12511.02s]  No, no, no.
[12511.02s -> 12515.63s]  I don't feel so good.
[12515.63s -> 12518.66s]  No, no.
[12520.66s -> 12522.96s]  That's all I took myself back together
[12522.96s -> 12524.96s]  is to get the particles back in me.
[12524.96s -> 12540.76s]  Do the slap chop.
[12540.76s -> 12541.76s]  Hey, it spins with the slap chop.
[12541.76s -> 12542.76s]  Yeah, you're going to slap.
[12542.76s -> 12543.76s]  You're going to cry.
[12543.76s -> 12544.76s]  Your onions cry.
[12544.76s -> 12545.76s]  You're making me cry.
[12545.76s -> 12546.76s]  Yeah, throw it in the fucking sink.
[12546.76s -> 12549.76s]  So what we got here, quickest tuna salad you ever made.
[12549.76s -> 12550.76s]  Here we go.
[12550.76s -> 12551.76s]  Slap it a couple of times.
[12551.76s -> 12552.76s]  One, two, three.
[12552.76s -> 12553.76s]  Easy as pie.
[12553.76s -> 12556.76s]  The thing to clean it, it opens up like a butterfly.
[12556.76s -> 12557.76s]  See?
[12557.76s -> 12558.76s]  Take a look at that.
[12558.76s -> 12559.76s]  See?
[12559.76s -> 12560.76s]  It's easy.
[12560.76s -> 12561.76s]  No, no, no mess.
[12561.76s -> 12562.76s]  No bullshit.
[12562.76s -> 12564.76s]  Throw it in the fucking sink behind me.
[12564.76s -> 12567.47s]  Oh, my God.
[12567.47s -> 12573.68s]  I just died.
[12573.68s -> 12574.68s]  All right.
[12574.68s -> 12581.88s]  Time to do some JoJo poses.
[12581.88s -> 12587.00s]  I was turning into Trump.
[12587.00s -> 12601.81s]  All right.
[12601.81s -> 12602.81s]  I'm looking at it.
[12602.81s -> 12603.81s]  I looked at this.
[12603.81s -> 12608.48s]  Somebody sent me like a compilation.
[12608.48s -> 12611.56s]  JoJo poses.
[12611.56s -> 12612.56s]  Which one am I typing in?
[12612.56s -> 12620.86s]  I'll do like three or four of them.
[12620.86s -> 12623.29s]  Am I going to hate this for the rest of my life?
[12623.29s -> 12624.29s]  What's worse?
[12624.29s -> 12626.60s]  Like, honestly, what's worse?
[12626.60s -> 12639.58s]  JoJo poses or the Velociraptor?
[12639.58s -> 12640.58s]  Really?
[12640.58s -> 12645.15s]  The Velociraptor is probably the worst thing I've ever done.
[12645.15s -> 12646.15s]  I mean, in my whole life.
[12646.15s -> 12648.39s]  In my actual entire life.
[12648.39s -> 12653.46s]  I can't think of anything that I would rather go back and redo.
[12653.46s -> 12657.96s]  You know, if I had a time machine, it was like, oh, hey, you could go back and fix one thing.
[12657.96s -> 12660.13s]  What would you fix?
[12660.13s -> 12662.13s]  It would be me doing that Velociraptor.
[12662.13s -> 12664.13s]  Now I understand why somebody wanted me to do it.
[12664.13s -> 12668.13s]  Now I get it why it was like one of the things that somebody put it in the channel there.
[12668.13s -> 12671.13s]  Because holy shit, that was the most embarrassing thing I've ever done.
[12671.13s -> 12673.13s]  And I can never take it back.
[12673.13s -> 12674.13s]  And it was on a green screen.
[12674.13s -> 12677.13s]  So now it could be used anywhere.
[12677.13s -> 12686.44s]  All right.
[12686.44s -> 12689.74s]  So could some of the mods help me out here?
[12689.74s -> 12692.74s]  I don't know what these are.
[12692.74s -> 12700.12s]  Are there any mods that like know JoJo at all?
[12700.12s -> 12708.52s]  JoJo is embarrassing.
[12708.52s -> 12710.52s]  People, everyone's telling me it is.
[12710.52s -> 12711.52s]  I don't know.
[12711.52s -> 12713.52s]  I know like three JoJo.
[12713.52s -> 12718.41s]  Somebody help me.
[12718.41s -> 12721.51s]  Okay.
[12721.51s -> 12722.51s]  JoJo poses.
[12722.51s -> 12725.51s]  I'm just going to look at a video and try to recreate it.
[12725.51s -> 12727.96s]  Okay.
[12727.96s -> 12730.96s]  Here's the only the best JoJo poses.
[12730.96s -> 12740.12s]  I can't like do half of these.
[12740.12s -> 12741.12s]  All right.
[12741.12s -> 12748.63s]  I'll do this one.
[12748.63s -> 12753.62s]  I need to look at it one more time.
[12753.62s -> 12760.94s]  So this one looks like it goes like this.
[12760.94s -> 12764.87s]  Like that.
[12764.87s -> 12780.56s]  That was awful.
[12780.56s -> 12783.73s]  I thought that was a pros practicing.
[12783.73s -> 12805.52s]  All right.
[12805.52s -> 12815.91s]  Let's pick another one.
[12815.91s -> 12816.91s]  Okay.
[12816.91s -> 12817.91s]  Okay.
[12817.91s -> 12822.16s]  Okay.
[12822.16s -> 12823.16s]  We click this one.
[12823.16s -> 12824.16s]  How does this one work?
[12824.16s -> 12830.20s]  You go like this.
[12830.20s -> 12865.97s]  This is worse than the Raptor.
[12865.97s -> 12868.92s]  Who else?
[12868.92s -> 12872.59s]  All right.
[12872.59s -> 12874.59s]  This one, he turns his hand into like a snake.
[12874.59s -> 12878.86s]  He goes, I'll do this one.
[12878.86s -> 12879.86s]  Oops.
[12879.86s -> 12906.25s]  He goes like, no, it's just look at me.
[12906.25s -> 12910.18s]  Look at me.
[12910.18s -> 12913.25s]  The Imgur link had a bunch more.
[12913.25s -> 12914.25s]  Okay.
[12914.25s -> 12916.26s]  I'm not doing that one.
[12916.26s -> 12924.32s]  I'm not doing the one with the guy puts his dick out.
[12924.32s -> 12925.32s]  What?
[12925.32s -> 12926.32s]  I don't understand.
[12926.32s -> 12927.32s]  Okay.
[12927.32s -> 12928.32s]  What?
[12928.32s -> 12929.95s]  I'll do Mewtwo.
[12929.95s -> 12930.95s]  All right.
[12930.95s -> 12933.47s]  Mewtwo goes like this.
[12933.47s -> 12940.08s]  It's like.
[12940.08s -> 12970.12s]  So that was, that's Mewtwo.
[12970.12s -> 12971.12s]  His fingers are different.
[12971.12s -> 12972.12s]  Okay.
[12972.12s -> 12973.12s]  They go like down too.
[12973.12s -> 12974.12s]  Okay.
[12974.12s -> 13004.80s]  I'll do it.
[13004.80s -> 13005.80s]  He's getting into it.
[13005.80s -> 13006.80s]  All right.
[13006.80s -> 13012.40s]  What do they do?
[13012.40s -> 13013.89s]  The one above Mewtwo.
[13013.89s -> 13054.30s]  He's got like a surprised face and he's like, he's going like left foot out.
[13055.48s -> 13067.47s]  What?
[13067.47s -> 13071.20s]  You got it.
[13071.20s -> 13072.20s]  He dabbed.
[13075.20s -> 13087.82s]  So his feet, one is out like that.
[13087.82s -> 13094.18s]  All right.
[13094.18s -> 13096.18s]  Well, there it is.
[13096.18s -> 13098.42s]  Any more Jojo poses?
[13098.42s -> 13111.22s]  I want, I need one more that people really want and that's it.
[13111.22s -> 13113.22s]  This is like the highest voted thing in the entire poll.
[13113.22s -> 13121.87s]  The point.
[13121.87s -> 13124.87s]  Well, you guys are saying names like I, like I know these characters.
[13124.87s -> 13135.58s]  All right.
[13135.58s -> 13136.58s]  I see the point.
[13136.58s -> 13139.80s]  I'll do the point.
[13139.80s -> 13143.49s]  This one is just like a, a sideways stance with a point.
[13143.49s -> 13144.49s]  He tilts his head down.
[13144.49s -> 13146.49s]  Like this one's a little close.
[13146.49s -> 13167.83s]  It's like.
[13167.83s -> 13170.84s]  It's just Phoenix Wright.
[13170.84s -> 13171.84s]  Okay.
[13171.84s -> 13172.84s]  I'm done.
[13172.84s -> 13174.20s]  I'm done.
[13177.76s -> 13179.76s]  Phoenix Wright.
[13179.76s -> 13182.76s]  It's my favorite Jojo character.
[13182.76s -> 13183.76s]  Oh my God.
[13183.76s -> 13185.76s]  I think somebody gave a hundred dollars.
[13185.76s -> 13192.45s]  I don't have my stream labs really set up here, but Kyra Toby just gave a hundred fucking dollars.
[13192.45s -> 13198.11s]  One hundred.
[13198.11s -> 13202.20s]  Thank you so much Kyra Toby.
[13202.20s -> 13205.34s]  One fucking hundred dollars.
[13205.34s -> 13208.03s]  This is for you Kyra Toby.
[13208.03s -> 13215.77s]  One hundred bits.
[13215.77s -> 13227.25s]  One hundred dollars.
[13227.25s -> 13234.19s]  Bam!
[13234.19s -> 13261.28s]  All right.
[13261.28s -> 13262.28s]  Now delete that.
[13262.28s -> 13265.61s]  How many things need to be deleted from this stream?
[13265.61s -> 13268.61s]  At least like, look at my sweaty ass hair.
[13268.61s -> 13274.59s]  Delete it though.
[13274.59s -> 13276.59s]  After the stream's over.
[13276.59s -> 13287.77s]  I thought I could trust you.
[13287.77s -> 13288.77s]  Oh my God.
[13288.77s -> 13289.77s]  There's like so many subs coming in.
[13289.77s -> 13290.77s]  Are you serious?
[13290.77s -> 13292.77s]  Oh my God.
[13292.77s -> 13296.32s]  Well.
[13296.32s -> 13320.43s]  That was terrible.
[13320.43s -> 13321.43s]  That was terrible.
[13321.43s -> 13323.43s]  Delete that too.
[13323.43s -> 13324.67s]  What does he do?
[13324.67s -> 13341.24s]  I don't know what he does.
[13341.24s -> 13347.16s]  I don't get.
[13347.16s -> 13348.16s]  I don't know what he does.
[13348.16s -> 13349.46s]  He goes like.
[13349.46s -> 13355.24s]  Right?
[13355.24s -> 13356.24s]  Like.
[13356.24s -> 13369.07s]  Okay.
[13369.07s -> 13371.07s]  I'm getting like addicted to the green screen.
[13371.07s -> 13376.25s]  Oh my fucking God.
[13376.25s -> 13377.25s]  Are there people still?
[13377.25s -> 13378.25s]  People are subbing.
[13378.25s -> 13379.25s]  Oh my God.
[13379.25s -> 13387.51s]  Jacket goes on the arm.
[13387.51s -> 13416.12s]  Oh my fucking God.
[13416.12s -> 13417.12s]  There's so many subs coming in.
[13417.12s -> 13419.12s]  This is fucking ridiculous.
[13419.12s -> 13424.32s]  Hey.
[13424.32s -> 13425.32s]  So many subs are coming in.
[13425.32s -> 13426.32s]  Let's do some JoJo dances.
[13426.32s -> 13430.38s]  I'm going to do them all.
[13430.38s -> 13432.38s]  I'm going to do them all.
[13432.38s -> 13454.16s]  He does that.
[13454.16s -> 13467.56s]  Praise the sun.
[13467.56s -> 13473.16s]  Oh my God.
[13473.16s -> 13474.16s]  More.
[13474.16s -> 13479.04s]  More.
[13479.04s -> 13480.41s]  More.
[13480.41s -> 13481.41s]  I don't know if I have any more in me.
[13481.41s -> 13482.41s]  I'm like.
[13482.41s -> 13483.41s]  I'm so exhausted.
[13483.41s -> 13485.10s]  What I put.
[13485.10s -> 13486.10s]  Alright.
[13486.10s -> 13487.10s]  Let me tell you.
[13487.10s -> 13488.10s]  When I put.
[13488.10s -> 13491.53s]  When I put on this jacket to do the fucking weather man.
[13491.53s -> 13493.53s]  I was already out of gas.
[13493.53s -> 13503.88s]  The gas was out of the tank.
[13503.88s -> 13505.88s]  You need to do the dance.
[13505.88s -> 13510.89s]  The dance?
[13510.89s -> 13511.89s]  What dance?
[13511.89s -> 13515.92s]  Kyra told me to give a hundred fucking dollars.
[13515.92s -> 13516.92s]  And then another.
[13516.92s -> 13518.29s]  Oh my God.
[13518.29s -> 13519.29s]  Oh my God.
[13519.29s -> 13520.29s]  I can't even keep up.
[13520.29s -> 13522.29s]  I don't have my like stream labs like available.
[13522.29s -> 13527.04s]  You guys are subbing like fucking crazy.
[13527.04s -> 13529.82s]  Tons of community subs going on.
[13529.82s -> 13530.82s]  Thanks so much guys.
[13530.82s -> 13536.77s]  This dance.
[13536.77s -> 13540.64s]  This one.
[13540.64s -> 13541.64s]  I can't.
[13541.64s -> 13542.64s]  This chats going so fast.
[13542.64s -> 13546.56s]  But let me.
[13546.56s -> 13547.56s]  Oh my God.
[13547.56s -> 13552.11s]  Five more.
[13552.11s -> 13553.41s]  Holy shit.
[13553.41s -> 13558.75s]  I can't.
[13558.75s -> 13559.75s]  I can't.
[13559.75s -> 13560.75s]  I can't.
[13560.75s -> 13562.37s]  Improvise.
[13562.37s -> 13566.68s]  What's my laugh tonight?
[13566.68s -> 13567.68s]  Jesus.
[13567.68s -> 13572.99s]  Dengustown fifty dollars.
[13572.99s -> 13574.99s]  Pocket Pauling fifty dollars.
[13574.99s -> 13578.11s]  Kyra told me a hundred dollars.
[13578.11s -> 13580.11s]  Like a hundred subs.
[13580.11s -> 13581.11s]  Holy shit.
[13581.11s -> 13582.73s]  Alright.
[13582.73s -> 13583.73s]  The Jojo dance.
[13583.73s -> 13591.56s]  Alright.
[13591.56s -> 13593.56s]  Everybody in chat link this dance.
[13593.56s -> 13594.56s]  Because I can't click it.
[13594.56s -> 13602.41s]  Twitchy Pyro just gave fifty dollars.
[13602.41s -> 13604.78s]  Oh my God.
[13604.78s -> 13607.30s]  Alright.
[13607.30s -> 13608.30s]  Let's see what the dance is.
[13608.30s -> 13610.56s]  Alright.
[13610.56s -> 13621.66s]  So let's see.
[13621.66s -> 13622.66s]  I can't.
[13622.66s -> 13623.66s]  This is like a whole thing.
[13623.66s -> 13631.47s]  I'm not going to be able to do this.
[13631.47s -> 13636.29s]  So it goes.
[13636.29s -> 13651.68s]  That's all I got.
[13651.68s -> 13660.64s]  I think everyone's going to be subbed by the end of this.
[13660.64s -> 13661.64s]  Holy shit guys.
[13661.64s -> 13664.00s]  I can't keep up with.
[13664.00s -> 13666.00s]  I don't have any of my stuff here.
[13666.00s -> 13667.18s]  I just have a laptop.
[13667.18s -> 13670.00s]  You guys are fucking amazing though.
[13670.00s -> 13671.00s]  Thank you.
[13671.00s -> 13673.07s]  Hope you guys had fun.
[13673.07s -> 13675.07s]  Because we're getting down to the end here.
[13675.07s -> 13687.85s]  I look forward to whatever you guys do with this.
[13687.85s -> 13694.96s]  The creativity from this community is second to none.
[13694.96s -> 13697.96s]  So I look forward to whatever you guys come up with.
[13697.96s -> 13699.96s]  So let me just while there's still a lot of people.
[13699.96s -> 13700.96s]  Let me talk about this.
[13700.96s -> 13705.96s]  So two weeks from now in two full weeks.
[13705.96s -> 13709.96s]  We're going to sit down and we're going to have a movie night.
[13709.96s -> 13712.96s]  So whatever you do with this footage.
[13712.96s -> 13714.96s]  Whatever you do with it.
[13714.96s -> 13716.96s]  Keep in mind a couple of very important things.
[13716.96s -> 13718.96s]  It has to be at least ten seconds long.
[13718.96s -> 13719.96s]  Ten seconds long.
[13719.96s -> 13721.96s]  So no like up.
[13721.96s -> 13723.96s]  Like we talked about right.
[13723.96s -> 13724.96s]  It's going to be ten seconds.
[13724.96s -> 13727.96s]  Or up to two minutes.
[13727.96s -> 13728.96s]  Nothing more than that.
[13728.96s -> 13731.96s]  If it's more than if it's two oh one.
[13731.96s -> 13733.32s]  It's out.
[13733.32s -> 13737.32s]  So up to two minutes at least ten seconds.
[13737.32s -> 13742.33s]  And these videos are going to be pre-screened.
[13742.33s -> 13746.51s]  So whatever you do with this.
[13746.51s -> 13749.51s]  Keep in mind if it's going to be shown on this stream.
[13749.51s -> 13755.82s]  Then it's going to be pre-screened.
[13755.82s -> 13760.82s]  So that means all potential bullshit that I don't want.
[13760.82s -> 13765.36s]  Obviously shown on stream will be taken care of.
[13765.36s -> 13767.36s]  This is not a contest by the way.
[13767.36s -> 13770.63s]  This is not a contest.
[13770.63s -> 13779.51s]  It's just for fun.
[13779.51s -> 13782.94s]  I just want to do it because it seemed like something fun to do.
[13782.94s -> 13783.94s]  No it's not.
[13783.94s -> 13787.44s]  It's not a contest.
[13787.44s -> 13789.44s]  But if you want to participate.
[13789.44s -> 13791.68s]  If you want to use this footage for something.
[13791.68s -> 13796.87s]  I hope you have fun.
[13796.87s -> 13797.87s]  How about this one?
[13797.87s -> 13801.24s]  How about this one?
[13801.24s -> 13811.55s]  How about Michael Jackson?
[13811.55s -> 13816.44s]  How about Moonwalk too?
[13816.44s -> 13825.97s]  See I went backwards.
[13825.97s -> 13828.40s]  I did it all wrong.
[13828.40s -> 13834.14s]  Oh reenact the gnome video.
[13834.14s -> 13847.88s]  I'm not even going to give you a chance.
[13847.88s -> 13848.88s]  All I said was I'm a gnome.
[13848.88s -> 13857.73s]  I didn't say anything else.
[13857.73s -> 13865.20s]  We said dude of Norman Osborn.
[13865.20s -> 13869.87s]  Peter you're a scientist.
[13869.87s -> 13873.00s]  I'm something of a scientist myself.
[13873.00s -> 13878.80s]  You know I find myself to be something of a scientist myself.
[13878.80s -> 13879.80s]  What?
[13879.80s -> 13882.13s]  Peter!
[13882.13s -> 13884.88s]  I hear you're quite the scientist.
[13884.88s -> 13893.10s]  Well I'm something of a scientist myself.
[13893.10s -> 13897.10s]  Get that in a fucking petri dish motherfucker!
[13897.10s -> 13917.28s]  I'm already editing this.
[13917.28s -> 13920.60s]  Oh somebody said do a fat roll.
[13920.60s -> 13921.60s]  Yeah I will.
[13921.60s -> 13924.23s]  I'm going to get hurt.
[13924.23s -> 13926.23s]  I'll do a fat roll with my fucking sword.
[13926.23s -> 13933.59s]  I'm going to be a Dark Souls character.
[13933.59s -> 13982.81s]  There you go.
[13982.81s -> 13983.81s]  Alright guys.
[13983.81s -> 13992.07s]  Dark Souls emotes.
[13992.07s -> 14006.39s]  TF2 taunts.
[14006.39s -> 14007.39s]  I'll do a scout.
[14007.39s -> 14022.56s]  Hey you're simply keeping track of my hands.
[14022.56s -> 14023.86s]  What?
[14023.86s -> 14032.27s]  What?
[14032.27s -> 14049.12s]  Do it again.
[14049.12s -> 14050.12s]  Do it again.
[14050.12s -> 14051.12s]  Do it again.
[14051.12s -> 14054.67s]  Dark Souls emotes.
[14054.67s -> 14055.67s]  What?
[14055.67s -> 14057.36s]  Alright.
[14057.36s -> 14058.36s]  The sun.
[14058.36s -> 14063.18s]  The very sun is this right?
[14063.18s -> 14064.18s]  Right?
[14064.18s -> 14065.18s]  Like up here?
[14065.18s -> 14066.36s]  I'm doing that right?
[14066.36s -> 14097.14s]  You go look up into your tippy toes alright?
[14097.14s -> 14100.75s]  Hey!
[14100.75s -> 14109.99s]  Hey!
[14109.99s -> 14111.61s]  There you go.
[14111.61s -> 14112.61s]  Very good.
[14112.61s -> 14118.40s]  I did the T-Pose.
[14118.40s -> 14122.40s]  I did like 30 minutes of T-Pose.
[14122.40s -> 14130.16s]  Oh I got it.
[14130.16s -> 14134.16s]  Yeah I already T-Posed.
[14134.16s -> 14138.38s]  Let me actually do some jumps.
[14138.38s -> 14143.74s]  I know a lot of people just like Mario.
[14143.74s -> 14170.60s]  Alright the cereal bowl.
[14170.60s -> 14182.53s]  Where is it?
[14182.53s -> 14192.60s]  No!
[14192.60s -> 14200.78s]  Get away from me with the spoon!
[14200.78s -> 14201.78s]  Don't eat me!
[14201.78s -> 14203.66s]  Don't eat me!
[14203.66s -> 14204.66s]  Don't eat me!
[14204.66s -> 14207.37s]  No!
[14207.37s -> 14215.27s]  No!
[14215.27s -> 14216.27s]  No!
[14216.27s -> 14217.27s]  No please!
[14217.27s -> 14220.28s]  Please don't do it!
[14220.28s -> 14230.49s]  That was me in a cereal bowl trying not to get eaten by a toddler eating cereal.
[14231.49s -> 14244.34s]  I did Toy Story earlier.
[14244.34s -> 14245.90s]  Alright.
[14245.90s -> 14246.90s]  I'm going to get out of here.
[14246.90s -> 14248.97s]  I am exhausted.
[14248.97s -> 14259.15s]  I want to make sure I got everything that I wanted to get.
[14259.15s -> 14269.28s]  The race!
[14269.28s -> 14270.28s]  The scooter!
[14270.28s -> 14290.98s]  Oh my god!
[14290.98s -> 14301.44s]  How do you work this thing?
[14301.44s -> 14302.44s]  I don't know how to work this.
[14302.44s -> 14308.58s]  It just like kicks up right?
[14308.58s -> 14311.33s]  There's some kind of locking mechanism on it.
[14311.33s -> 14315.67s]  Oh there it goes.
[14315.67s -> 14324.65s]  Just like that.
[14324.65s -> 14326.65s]  This is made for a small person.
[14326.65s -> 14330.68s]  I don't know how to ride this.
[14330.68s -> 14354.48s]  Do you see this shaking?
[14354.48s -> 14364.16s]  What's up man?
[14364.16s -> 14365.16s]  Alright one more.
[14365.16s -> 14382.45s]  Big trick.
[14382.45s -> 14383.45s]  There it is.
[14383.45s -> 14394.60s]  You know what I'm saying?
[14394.60s -> 14418.88s]  Alright.
[14418.88s -> 14424.66s]  Fine.
[14424.66s -> 14434.73s]  I'll do the narrow toe run.
[14434.73s -> 14440.90s]  Fine.
[14440.90s -> 14441.90s]  Alright.
[14441.90s -> 14442.90s]  Jump from the tree to tree.
[14442.90s -> 14487.47s]  I made it on the mount.
[14487.47s -> 14492.42s]  What do you have to say now?
[14492.42s -> 14493.42s]  Alright.
[14493.42s -> 14505.67s]  Do the spy crab?
[14505.67s -> 14506.67s]  Alright.
[14506.67s -> 14513.73s]  I'll see you guys later.
[14513.73s -> 14516.89s]  I got to clean up.
[14516.89s -> 14526.26s]  So have fun.
[14526.26s -> 14530.32s]  Good luck.
