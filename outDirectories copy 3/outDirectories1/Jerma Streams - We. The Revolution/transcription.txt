[0.95s -> 11.83s]  Hello everybody. I've been away for a little while. Just returned. I had a nice entertaining
[13.26s -> 23.14s]  four days. I got to hang out with a close friend. It was very, very, very cool. It's the first time
[23.14s -> 30.98s]  I've seen anybody from back in Massachusetts in almost six months. So that was great.
[34.18s -> 41.06s]  And I have, since the last four days, have developed a cough. Kim got sick.
[41.86s -> 48.02s]  She got a cough, a cold, and passed it along to me. So I'm gonna have to be muting. It's
[48.02s -> 55.46s]  not bad. I'm fine. But I'm gonna have to mute every so often to cough into a tissue.
[56.42s -> 63.40s]  So quarantine him already, yeah. But hopefully you guys have been doing well.
[65.56s -> 73.98s]  You are going to see another one of these four to plus day breaks again sooner than you think.
[73.98s -> 78.30s]  And I'm sorry that these are kind of all compound on top of each other. But apparently
[78.30s -> 85.66s]  like springs the time to come visit me. My mother is coming up to visit as well. But
[85.66s -> 91.26s]  that's not until, that's not like another month. But still I'll be taking another probably
[91.26s -> 96.38s]  four or five days off when mom comes up. So I just want to make you aware of that now.
[97.62s -> 104.95s]  Speaking of other things to plan and get ready for. What's tomorrow? Something going on tomorrow,
[104.95s -> 110.18s]  right? A video game that I have been looking forward to for years by a company whose video
[110.18s -> 116.73s]  games I've played for years. And I'm talking all the way back to the original King's Field.
[116.73s -> 125.48s]  I beat that game. I don't even talk about that. But Sekiro comes out tomorrow. And yes,
[125.48s -> 131.46s]  I know that there's like 200 million people watching it right now on streams. But I don't
[131.46s -> 137.85s]  have access to the game. I don't have like an early deal or something. So I'm just going to
[137.85s -> 145.50s]  get it. I'm going to play it when it comes up. It's already preloaded sitting in my steam
[145.50s -> 154.97s]  inventory. Inventory inventory inventory. It's going to be an amazing horrible time for you.
[154.97s -> 159.85s]  Sorry in advance. I'm looking forward to it. I love and this is the best part about a
[159.85s -> 164.97s]  brand new From Software game. Everybody in the chat is, you can't talk shit to me.
[164.97s -> 169.61s]  You can't because you don't know either. You know, there's no Wikipedia page with like
[169.61s -> 173.77s]  5,000 articles about, oh, this is the best thing to do. This is where you go here. Nope.
[174.49s -> 182.65s]  Nobody has any idea. You're going to be just as lost as I am. I love it. I don't have to
[182.65s -> 198.02s]  know in order to talk shit. That's true. That's true. You are correct. He's dying.
[198.02s -> 202.42s]  No, I told you I got a cough. It's just annoying. It doesn't hurt or anything.
[205.02s -> 208.86s]  But so I'm going to give you a plan. Let's go over the plan of action here.
[209.90s -> 216.98s]  So today is we're going to play this game called We The Revolution. It's a game that was
[216.98s -> 221.86s]  inspired by Papers, Please. It's a game where you have to admit you're a judge
[222.66s -> 226.50s]  and you're presented with cases and you either send people to the guillotine,
[227.46s -> 234.30s]  you acquit them, or you put them in jail. And you got to be careful because there's a lot of
[235.48s -> 242.50s]  crazy shit that can happen. Fighting in nations and political powers rising. It looked
[242.50s -> 248.10s]  interesting just to play because I didn't want to start something elaborate because tomorrow
[248.10s -> 252.90s]  I'm going to be streaming all day. Tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, I'm going to, I'm going to
[252.90s -> 258.82s]  play that game a shitload. So I figured let's just do something for a little while so I can
[258.82s -> 264.02s]  prepare my body for the inevitable like 30 plus hours of streaming I'm going to do over
[264.02s -> 278.15s]  the next like two and a half days, right? After Sekiro, when Sekiro is done, or maybe
[278.71s -> 284.87s]  even to take a break from Sekiro, Monster Rancher 4 is the next thing. Because I
[284.87s -> 289.18s]  want to go back to play it. I want to play Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 4 was when
[289.18s -> 299.40s]  we didn't try. And that's what's going to happen later on this coming week. There's also other
[299.40s -> 306.55s]  collaborative things, collabs with other people, that are still kind of floating around. Maybe
[306.55s -> 312.54s]  we'll get a new Beanbag Sonic. Possibly, yeah. But for now, for today, we're just going to
[312.54s -> 319.32s]  chill. I just got back, I have to be completely honest. I didn't really look at anything. I
[319.32s -> 322.60s]  haven't been planning any streams or anything for the last four days. I've just been hanging
[322.60s -> 329.06s]  out with friends. So I kind of just have what am I going to do today, right? This is what we're
[329.06s -> 338.73s]  going to do. Let's go ahead and open it up. Again, this is called We The Revolution. And
[338.73s -> 348.30s]  there it is on your screen. Do a collab with Quaker Oatman. What is it? What do you do?
[348.30s -> 355.42s]  The guy on the on like the cereal box? You're talking about George Washington, right?
[355.42s -> 359.32s]  I thought that was George Washington for like the first 30 years of my life.
[360.87s -> 367.08s]  It is George Washington, isn't it? Is it? Who is on the front of the Quaker Oats?
[370.58s -> 384.60s]  Wait, no, no, no, for real. Who? Who's on the Quaker Oats box? The Quaker man is not an actual
[384.60s -> 389.48s]  person. His image is that of a man dressed in the Quaker garb chosen because the Quaker faith.
[390.62s -> 396.87s]  Wait, that's not supposed to be George Washington. Well, I knew it wasn't George
[396.87s -> 404.36s]  Washington. I just want to make sure you knew. I got to turn this down. This is loud.
[408.22s -> 411.42s]  No, I knew it wasn't George Washington. I'm just fucking around. All right, new profile.
[412.30s -> 417.26s]  This game just came out today. So we're going to give it a check. You know that steam review.
[417.26s -> 431.38s]  Let's see. Let's just make sure this is correct. Full screen. Yeah, that's yeah,
[431.38s -> 433.54s]  let's get a tutorial just because we don't know what the hell we're doing.
[434.34s -> 440.06s]  Game options, audio. I always hate having music. That's something I got to tell.
[440.06s -> 444.62s]  I got to give some developers a little bit of audio lessons here. You know,
[444.62s -> 450.31s]  I'm the master of audio. Don't have music be the same volume percentage as sound and voice.
[450.87s -> 457.48s]  This should always be like 30% lower. How many trailers you ever watched where the music was the
[457.48s -> 463.16s]  same volume as people talking? Music is supposed to be in the background, not in the foreground.
[463.72s -> 472.62s]  Some people even do it like this. That's wrong. If you have people talking and sound effects,
[472.62s -> 476.06s]  you want the music to be at a decibel much lower because you can hear them talking.
[477.91s -> 484.81s]  No wonder he didn't like doom. I liked doom. What did I give doom?
[486.20s -> 489.32s]  That's better. Okay, see maybe even a little lower, like 47.
[490.04s -> 496.74s]  Why did it go to zero? What? Oh, it didn't. Okay, the song ended.
[504.20s -> 510.92s]  Okay, we the revolution. This is like Ace Attorney. Just imagine playing Ace Attorney
[510.92s -> 515.34s]  for all of the Ace Attorney fans. I wonder if I'm gonna have to do any voice acting.
[515.34s -> 519.30s]  Let's see if I can do some voice acting. Oh no, they're gonna be way better than me.
[519.30s -> 520.34s]  Never mind, I'll just be quiet.
[564.26s -> 566.34s]  This takes place in the French Revolution, if you didn't know.
[572.60s -> 577.00s]  Play as Jean Paul Gosseau. He used to own a Marine tank.
[580.92s -> 591.61s]  He was nothing. I am better than he was. People will follow in my footsteps.
[593.69s -> 596.81s]  I know this factor. Father.
[601.10s -> 606.55s]  Who is he? That like people will follow him in my footsteps, like I've heard it before.
[607.58s -> 615.80s]  Music's too quiet. I can't hear. The game is louder than me. France, turn off the 18th
[615.80s -> 622.79s]  century. Turn to the 18th century. Prologue. I hope this is a fucking musical.
[624.31s -> 631.96s]  Everything from France is a musical. Has to be. Every piece of media, every TV show, every film.
[642.31s -> 657.10s]  Is he but a puke too? Is that me? All right, so now I get to talk. Remind me next time I
[657.10s -> 663.34s]  want to stop drinking this cloudy rotgut. Remind me before I drink it. We're disgracing
[663.98s -> 677.50s]  Thomas. Is someone coming? This was bound to happen. I told you. Papa, you said we would go.
[678.14s -> 686.39s]  You promised. Papa had a lot of work. Yes, a lot of heavy glasses. You promised me.
[686.39s -> 693.30s]  I can't anymore. I'm fed up with asking. Mama is angry because- Quiet. Today it's hard to
[693.30s -> 703.61s]  do four people at the same time, okay? All different ages. Today your favorite son wanted
[703.61s -> 709.53s]  to prove he was more honorable than his father, so he started a fight. A five-year-old boy,
[709.53s -> 714.18s]  for God's sake. Our neighbors wanted you to explain that to them, but well,
[714.18s -> 720.26s]  you were fighting for justice. At an inn, damn you, you bloody drunk. Mama.
[724.87s -> 729.19s]  Is this kid on trial? Oh, this is like a trial. Okay, hold on.
[731.24s -> 735.24s]  Drag and drop documents to manage their layout click to display their contents.
[736.76s -> 744.01s]  React to events. Ignoring them may have severe consequences. Okay, so that's events, documents.
[744.81s -> 748.33s]  Review detailed information about current events, actions, and characters.
[749.13s -> 753.99s]  Okay. Choose- Consider the effects and decide the defendant's fate.
[754.55s -> 759.80s]  And you can change the settings from here. Review the current balance of power in Paris
[759.80s -> 766.14s]  and your position therein. So that's the balance of power. Intrigues are complex conflicts
[766.22s -> 771.10s]  between you and another political player. A defeat may turn out to be disastrous for you.
[771.10s -> 777.80s]  This is how many influence points I have of the main currency in the game. Use them wisely.
[779.32s -> 782.76s]  And then we got like a Sims notification field. Pay close attention to the changes
[782.76s -> 789.40s]  in your influence and relations with factions. Okay. Some of your decisions and changes in the
[789.40s -> 794.36s]  world of the game may cause global modifiers to come into effect. These factors affect
[794.36s -> 799.88s]  relations, reputation, and influence. You can review them in the notebook.
[801.40s -> 808.84s]  All right, so guilty. No, punishment. Make the most important decision. Condemn the defendant
[808.84s -> 817.94s]  or deem them not guilty. Sign the document to legitimize your verdict. Okay, so choose a
[817.94s -> 823.10s]  verdict. What if I just say you're guilty? I'm dead, right? All right, so here we go.
[823.10s -> 827.88s]  Case file. Review charges and facts. This will make it easier for you to unlock questions
[827.88s -> 835.24s]  for the defendant. Okay, so review charges and facts. But where are these the facts?
[839.10s -> 846.50s]  All right, so case file. This is an assault. Skip this? I'm not gonna skip this. I have to,
[846.50s -> 853.06s]  what am I gonna go off of like how I feel? We have not expected this kind of behavior from
[853.06s -> 858.82s]  your son, although apparently we should have. Innocent child's play turned into an assault
[858.82s -> 867.00s]  on our children. The younger one, Antoine, now has a chipped front tooth. We hope that
[867.00s -> 871.24s]  you will punish your child accordingly. Should the situation repeat itself, we will react more
[871.24s -> 877.40s]  decisive decisively. I am sure we can deal with the gambler and drunkard even if he is a judge.
[877.40s -> 884.44s]  We will not let our children be hurt. Okay, can I click these? We should have. Innocent,
[884.44s -> 891.03s]  an innocent child's play turned into an assault. Innocent. Finding links. I'm not
[891.03s -> 895.18s]  gonna put my son to the guillotine. Find the correct links to unlock questions for
[895.26s -> 898.94s]  the defendant. Choose a line of inquiry and link it to the right category.
[900.95s -> 907.77s]  Okay, what the fuck? While linking lines of inquiry in categories, you can make a limited
[907.77s -> 912.33s]  number of mistakes. If you make too many mistakes, the whole system will become locked.
[914.44s -> 923.80s]  Oh god. And there are traps here too? Some cases may contain traps. Read through the
[923.80s -> 930.60s]  files thoroughly to find the lines of inquiry that are irrelevant. Okay, so child's play.
[932.90s -> 936.50s]  I thought that you said eating children. I was like, that, where did that come from?
[936.50s -> 942.95s]  All right, wait, wait, go back, go back, back. Course of events. Wait, wait, hold on,
[942.95s -> 948.97s]  let me look at this. So, innocent child's play turned into an assault. The younger one.
[949.61s -> 953.69s]  So, Antoine has a chipped front tooth. So, innocent child's play turned into a chipped
[953.69s -> 961.35s]  front tooth. Should the situation repeat itself, we will react more. So, okay,
[961.35s -> 968.74s]  innocent child's play into a front tooth being chipped. Okay, so let's take a look.
[969.80s -> 989.03s]  Child's play to, all right, so we've got course of events in victim. Wait, this isn't a
[989.03s -> 995.26s]  Jerma game. Yes, it is. All right, this is the victim. Fighting children is the
[995.26s -> 1004.26s]  extenuating circumstance. No, no, no, chipped tooth is the extenuating circumstance. Oh, fuck.
[1008.90s -> 1015.08s]  That's all right, we have a question. Hold on. Gather information to influence
[1015.08s -> 1019.32s]  the jury's attitude. Why is there a jury here? Why am I bringing this? This is what happens when
[1019.32s -> 1026.49s]  you have a dad judge. All right, this is the embarrassing shit that you have to go through.
[1026.49s -> 1033.64s]  What exactly were they saying? Okay, who started the fight? To ask questions, you have to first
[1033.64s -> 1037.88s]  unlock them in the inquiry linking menu. Okay, being in the jury's good graces allows you to
[1037.88s -> 1046.04s]  find out which way they will sway after you have asked a question. Okay, so you can sway
[1046.60s -> 1055.05s]  on home. Let me go back to this. So an injured Anton. So we've got possibility of repeating.
[1055.05s -> 1062.14s]  We've got fighting children is the that's the course of events. Okay, chipped tooth is also
[1062.14s -> 1070.71s]  the course of events. All right, that's I get it. All right, what's my son's name? How did
[1070.71s -> 1076.30s]  your play turn into a fight? That makes sense. How did your play turn into a fight?
[1077.32s -> 1081.00s]  Our neighbors, Antoine and Jean, they were saying mean things about you.
[1081.56s -> 1085.48s]  We were playing guards and they asked me to pretend to be a drunkard whom they would,
[1085.48s -> 1093.22s]  you know, you were fighting both of them at once. I had to. All right, so they were making
[1093.22s -> 1099.19s]  fun of me. And then he started fighting two people at the same time. All right, who started
[1099.19s -> 1105.06s]  this fight? Did you start it? Or did somebody for a rocket? Who started the fight? I can tell
[1105.06s -> 1113.14s]  you who ended it. He didn't have a bruise or anything. Oh, he did. I think it was me. I
[1113.14s -> 1118.89s]  kicked the one on the left and then wanted to get the one on the right. But but they ended
[1118.89s -> 1127.75s]  it. They knocked me to the ground and paid me back for hitting them. Okay, so you so they
[1128.55s -> 1135.34s]  made they made fun of me and then you kicked one of them. Okay, what did you really break
[1135.82s -> 1141.66s]  Antoine's tooth? There's a really noisy courtroom with nobody being here. Yeah.
[1143.16s -> 1148.12s]  Frederick is just a child. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think I broke his tooth.
[1149.00s -> 1154.76s]  Did you hit him in the face? I think I kicked him, but not that hard. Okay, but in the
[1154.76s -> 1166.76s]  face. Did you kick him in the face? What were they saying? Are you too drunk to guess? Who
[1166.76s -> 1174.39s]  is this person? Can I contempt a court this person out of here? I was not asking you.
[1174.39s -> 1178.39s]  They were yelling that you are well, I told them that it's not true. And they started
[1178.39s -> 1185.34s]  calling me names. They called me a drunkard's son. Okay, so let me look at this one more
[1185.34s -> 1192.25s]  time. The young one now has a chipped front tooth. He probably fell down. Let me look
[1192.25s -> 1197.38s]  at this shit. Negative relations with factions mean negative consequences for you.
[1198.90s -> 1207.98s]  AKA the fervor in Paris rising. So this is my relations. There are factions. Yeah, reputation.
[1207.98s -> 1212.46s]  Reputation impacts everything in the world of the game. Factions, family relations,
[1212.46s -> 1218.78s]  the audience's attitude. That's you. That's you guys. The fervor in the sections and even the
[1218.78s -> 1224.10s]  ability to persuade other characters. You have a set amount of influence points per day. In
[1224.10s -> 1229.46s]  the future, you will be able to increase this limit. All right, so how many death penalties
[1229.46s -> 1234.36s]  do I have? Zero. So this is the common folk. This is how the common folk feel about me. This
[1234.36s -> 1240.15s]  is how the revolutionaries feel about me. This is my reputation is pretty much right in the
[1240.79s -> 1248.22s]  Okay, this good to know. What's this? Events. Here you'll find okay, this is information about
[1248.22s -> 1254.22s]  events. And then this last one is people and family and okay, you can see detailed
[1254.22s -> 1261.50s]  info. So this is my wife. This is my oldest son. No, it's not. Yes, this is my oldest
[1261.50s -> 1270.66s]  son. This is my youngest son. I have my dad and then my mentor. Got it. So this is all family in
[1270.66s -> 1282.79s]  here. All right, so look at the hierarchy for a second. This is me. A judge of the
[1282.79s -> 1287.67s]  Revolutionary Tribunal, generally considered drunkard and gambler, a protege of Raymond
[1287.67s -> 1291.91s]  DuVoy, who introduced him to the world of law and regulations. In private, he is an
[1291.91s -> 1297.22s]  unremarkable character. We'll just wait till I make it up to like top 1000 streamer
[1302.42s -> 1309.19s]  in Vegas. All right, so let's let me get this straight. He started the fight. Somebody if
[1309.19s -> 1312.55s]  somebody calls me names, you just tell them you just you just tell them to shut the fuck up.
[1312.55s -> 1323.29s]  Okay. You can't like attack somebody you can't you're guilty. You say leave me alone.
[1324.47s -> 1337.67s]  You say oh yeah well my dad's a judge. What's this? Make your decision. Each action may
[1337.67s -> 1341.59s]  require a different number of influence points and have a different chance of success. Consider
[1341.59s -> 1353.30s]  them carefully. Intimidate parents. We can go right to evil if you want. Your addictions
[1353.30s -> 1357.54s]  are no longer a secret. The fact that other children are bullying your son because of them
[1357.54s -> 1362.90s]  is a minor problem. But who is spreading those rumors? It is likely to be one of their
[1362.90s -> 1367.86s]  parents. They could have whispered into their children's ears whom they shouldn't play with
[1367.86s -> 1373.86s]  and why. They might even have spiced the story with a lie. But who will but who will hear it next?
[1379.40s -> 1385.16s]  Now I can't just go fall on chaotic evil. No. Let's talk eye to eye. This is one influence
[1385.16s -> 1403.54s]  point. Talk eye to eye. Neighborhood gossip. So now what does that do for me now?
[1410.68s -> 1422.38s]  Neighborhood gossip. Yeah I've read this already. So this is reputation influence. I mean I
[1422.38s -> 1431.58s]  already read this. Did that show up in a different place? Maybe we'll see later on.
[1432.30s -> 1437.91s]  Because I don't think I can. I think that just means I'm going to talk to them. Any other
[1437.91s -> 1448.14s]  questions? Now what about you guys? Can I interact with anybody here? No I think that
[1448.14s -> 1455.13s]  just happens at some point later on. Because now there's nothing really else to do. Vertex
[1455.13s -> 1466.38s]  form. To the gallows. No. I mean I found the defendant guilty of the offense which they
[1466.38s -> 1471.10s]  were charged. You kicked somebody. How am I supposed to prove that you didn't, right?
[1471.10s -> 1479.67s]  Here's my signature. I'm not going to give my actual signature because I don't want anyone to
[1479.67s -> 1489.24s]  have that. What's my name? I'm scared to even do anything remotely similar. How about um
[1496.65s -> 1506.52s]  oh there we go. I did it. Guilty. Unfortunately you should not start fights regardless of
[1506.52s -> 1517.58s]  the reason. Look come on. Does my son go to prison? Those children are so small and they
[1517.58s -> 1523.34s]  already know the truth. The father of my children is a lying drunk and a gambler. Bernard used to
[1523.34s -> 1528.70s]  worship you but he soon grew up. Now it is Frederick's turn to learn the truth that echoes
[1528.70s -> 1534.33s]  in the streets. He's no longer fearing your anger. He knows that your threats are empty.
[1534.89s -> 1538.25s]  Frederick is only starting to learn the truth about his father from the streets.
[1539.88s -> 1547.62s]  I was unaware that Matilda had such a temper. As was I. We will wait outside as always.
[1554.60s -> 1571.64s]  Congratulations. You passed the first judge exam. Paris. Liberty. We were enchanted by the idea
[1571.64s -> 1585.14s]  of freedom. Could not resist it. Is that me or am I taking these pictures? Yeah I'm taking
[1585.14s -> 1589.30s]  these photos. Whole families took to the streets. We're on like this is like vacation photos.
[1592.66s -> 1606.87s]  France was never so happy. We were enchanted by the idea of freedom.
[1607.91s -> 1612.86s]  Yeah this is the revolution. Yeah I know it's very loud. It's one of those games
[1612.86s -> 1622.17s]  it's very loud if it's in a cut scene. Act one. All right here we go. Liberty day one.
[1632.66s -> 1641.46s]  Okay here we go. So expected sentence. Find out which verdict is expected by the factions
[1641.46s -> 1654.09s]  and your close ones. Okay so acquittal and prison. The common folk and revolutionaries want
[1654.09s -> 1666.84s]  prison and this is um nobody expected but who is it? Police file. Okay hold on. Wait wait wait
[1667.08s -> 1670.76s]  everybody hold on a second. I need like a minute to get ready. There's no timer.
[1671.48s -> 1676.84s]  I can take as long as I want. Imagine a judge saying this. I can take as long as I want. I
[1676.84s -> 1684.30s]  just I need to review the case first. I might need to get a coffee too. All right so this is
[1685.80s -> 1689.08s]  in difficult times people like to seek peace at the bottom of a glass.
[1690.33s -> 1698.81s]  Please introduce yourself. My name is Jean Renard and the Montserrat is huge. Nothing but a fraud.
[1700.89s -> 1704.97s]  Systematically opposing the opinion of the jury may lead to serious consequences.
[1705.53s -> 1710.12s]  Okay so everyone wants this guy arrested. Let's see what he did.
[1711.00s -> 1718.06s]  Compiled by Richard Moneur. Fraud. Jean Renard, a 45 year old innkeeper, has been charged with
[1718.06s -> 1724.30s]  fraud. He's accused of diluting alcohol in his tavern, tricking his clients into paying extra.
[1725.18s -> 1731.75s]  Okay. Guests came with their mindset on a specific goal, getting roaring drunk,
[1731.75s -> 1736.87s]  but instead of staggering out after drinking two pitchers of wine or several pints of beer,
[1736.87s -> 1740.55s]  they would sit in the inn until morning still sober and completely penniless.
[1741.51s -> 1745.67s]  The innkeeper's fraud came to light when one of the customers discovered the scam
[1745.67s -> 1750.39s]  and caught the cheater in the act. The man entered the host cellar and witnessed him
[1750.39s -> 1756.71s]  diluting the alcohol in the barrels with ordinary water. As a result, customers received
[1756.71s -> 1762.15s]  only four parts of what they had paid for and one part from the water carrier.
[1763.03s -> 1772.06s]  So he was diluting alcohol, but all right. So let's see. So diluting alcohol. So the innkeeper
[1773.16s -> 1776.92s]  exposing the innkeeper, customers drunkenness, adding water was the method.
[1777.88s -> 1786.46s]  Okay. Diluting alcohol was the method. But what about, I need a motive. What's going on here?
[1786.46s -> 1795.40s]  Motive for the innkeeper. Caught in a trap. What does that mean? I wouldn't even caught in
[1795.40s -> 1808.92s]  a trap. Did he set a trap? I can't ask any more questions. What? No. Customers drunkenness,
[1809.64s -> 1815.58s]  are the witnesses. Fuck. Shit. Exposing the innkeeper is the motive.
[1821.19s -> 1827.91s]  It's the motive and exposing the innkeeper. We need witnesses, right? Okay. We're good.
[1827.91s -> 1835.64s]  Here we go. So we have influence on the jury's opinion. This is people are going to want like
[1836.20s -> 1847.03s]  guillotine. Should I just call in the witness? People want this guy dead. How long you've
[1847.03s -> 1850.31s]  been involved in the illegal practice of diluting alcohol? Yeah, that means like,
[1851.19s -> 1860.86s]  do your clients drink a lot? Okay. Please call in Thomas Leclerc to the stands.
[1861.42s -> 1869.16s]  Please introduce yourself. Thomas Leclerc. I'm the regular Gene Renard's establishment.
[1870.28s -> 1879.00s]  Okay. How long have you suspected that something was wrong with the alcohol?
[1879.72s -> 1885.45s]  How did you catch citizen? How did you catch him in the act? How'd you catch him in the
[1885.45s -> 1892.81s]  act? I was having one drink after another. So I had to, you know, I'm Monterey. I think
[1892.81s -> 1897.29s]  that means Pete. So it happened that one time I got lost and instead of, you know, I
[1897.29s -> 1901.37s]  ended up in the cellar where I saw Renard adding water to the barrels.
[1904.57s -> 1908.55s]  Fuck. They want him in prison. All right. So that's a witness testimony.
[1911.18s -> 1916.25s]  Wait, wait, wait. Can I tell her, can I like, is it like, where's my gavel?
[1918.87s -> 1924.23s]  Please call it, okay. Review the trials records so I can review what happened previously.
[1924.23s -> 1930.97s]  All right. A button news here. Here we go. Neighborhood gossip. The father had a rare
[1930.97s -> 1935.05s]  episode of foolishness when he decided to stand up to someone stronger. Threatening
[1935.05s -> 1939.93s]  him with a fist and showing his children they are safe by his side. He did not listen to
[1939.93s -> 1944.65s]  your arguments. Furthermore, he gave a precise description of where you can shove them. What?
[1946.46s -> 1952.66s]  Why am I getting this right now during a case? Like somebody just slides that on the
[1952.66s -> 1961.56s]  desk. I know you're busy with this, this case, but somebody, what? I don't know,
[1961.56s -> 1968.82s]  man. I might, I might say fuck this guy. Okay. So threatening him with a fist and
[1968.82s -> 1971.70s]  showing his children they're safe by his side. He didn't listen to your arguments.
[1972.34s -> 1979.90s]  What we don't, oh yeah. Like I'm supposed to be doing a case here.
[1983.45s -> 1987.45s]  I'm hiring thugs not to hurt them. They're going to go do the, two of them are going
[1987.45s -> 1990.41s]  to go. I had two influence points. They're going to both raise their fist at him like
[1990.41s -> 1993.93s]  he did to me. And then he's going to hire three thugs and do that to me. And we're
[1993.93s -> 2000.26s]  going to keep going until one of us eventually wins the auction. All right. So let's take a look
[2000.26s -> 2004.74s]  again. We already know. All right. Let me do some more questions. Probably let's question them.
[2006.52s -> 2014.47s]  Okay. So how did you feel? Do clients drink a lot? Tavern regulars usually drink a lot.
[2015.27s -> 2020.92s]  So you have been selling plenty of wine. Quite a lot. Yeah. And yet you have been
[2020.92s -> 2025.24s]  paying taxes on the amount of wine you bought, not the amount of wine you've been selling.
[2025.24s -> 2035.05s]  Correct. I don't understand. You've been paying taxes on four wine barrels, but by adding a quarter
[2035.05s -> 2039.77s]  of water to each have actually made the money for selling five barrels of wine.
[2040.57s -> 2046.66s]  Oh, that's one way of putting it, but perhaps it is correct. I'm not good with numbers.
[2047.70s -> 2051.30s]  You are not good with numbers, yet good enough to have calculated that fraud pays off.
[2052.10s -> 2055.74s]  I wasn't aware. I will take this answer into account.
[2057.53s -> 2067.10s]  The judge has exposed the bastard. This guy's an idiot. Okay. How long you've been involved
[2067.10s -> 2073.32s]  in the illegal practice of diluting alcohol. It's not an illegal practice. Everyone adds a
[2073.32s -> 2077.85s]  little bit. In your case, it was a bit of wine in the water, not the other way around.
[2078.49s -> 2083.46s]  Have you been doing this for a long time? A few weeks at the most. It's been hard to
[2083.46s -> 2088.18s]  earn a living lately. I used to run an honest business. Pure wine was overspilling the
[2088.18s -> 2094.12s]  glasses. Is there any proof to support your testimony? He lied to his customers. No reason
[2094.12s -> 2100.30s]  he wouldn't lie in court. Does he have anything? Give me some documents. Anything.
[2101.02s -> 2112.39s]  You don't got anything to give me here. How did you feel about tricking the citizens?
[2113.90s -> 2118.78s]  Terrible. But all I wanted was to keep my business afloat. Others don't mess around for
[2118.78s -> 2124.38s]  sure. No diluting would be the end of me. So you decided to commit fraud so as not to lose
[2124.38s -> 2130.94s]  money. If I lost my tavern, my family would starve to death. Do you have children? I do.
[2130.94s -> 2136.60s]  One son and two daughters. Time to start saving up for the dowry. Then why don't you send them
[2136.60s -> 2144.68s]  to work? Idiot. All right. It's, uh, jury's opinion is prison. They're getting inflamed
[2144.68s -> 2156.33s]  here. People want him in prison. Uh, let me see. Yeah. Let's take a look. What do we
[2156.33s -> 2162.78s]  got here? Choose a verdict to see its influence. The jury votes in favor of incarceration.
[2163.50s -> 2168.71s]  The defendant, they find the punishment sufficient. Choose a verdict. Prison.
[2170.28s -> 2174.84s]  So this would, uh, give me a reputation bonus with common folk and with revolutionaries.
[2177.32s -> 2181.53s]  Reputation bonus if you can get up there. Okay. Uh, what about a quiddle?
[2183.29s -> 2192.81s]  Go on. Go free. Just don't do it again. All right. I'm sorry, sir, but you've been,
[2192.81s -> 2196.25s]  I mean, we've got witness testimony. We've got your own testimony. You're talking about tax
[2196.25s -> 2205.26s]  fraud. You're going to prison. Sorry, but that's the way it is. I sentence citizen
[2205.26s -> 2214.07s]  Jean Renard to prison. Lead the condemned out. Huzzah. Long live pure wine. All right.
[2214.63s -> 2219.50s]  Moving on. After trial, click to move on to the next part.
[2221.19s -> 2223.75s]  We're going to get some big like fucking M. Night Shyamalan twist.
[2227.03s -> 2238.10s]  Verdict form. Here we go. Okay. May I remind you that you promised to join me?
[2238.10s -> 2244.23s]  I have a feeling that tonight's moon favors gamblers, though it does not favor spouses.
[2245.77s -> 2249.85s]  God should grace us with wives who understand the importance of an evening game of dice.
[2250.41s -> 2254.01s]  They should also know that the right amount of wine guarantees a lucky role.
[2255.08s -> 2261.85s]  I should go home. Bringing a judge to the game has benefits. Other players will surely not cheat.
[2263.18s -> 2267.45s]  That is not a strong argument. My name is Jacques-Louis David.
[2268.01s -> 2271.13s]  I am but a humble painter, not a silver-tongued judge.
[2272.42s -> 2276.78s]  You are a sly politician, Jacques. As a politician, I understand the
[2276.78s -> 2281.74s]  importance of keeping promises. And you, my friend, are trying to get out of yours.
[2289.00s -> 2293.32s]  Go out or go home? I just got in trouble with my wife for going out.
[2297.50s -> 2300.62s]  Go out. But this could be a good political move for me.
[2301.18s -> 2316.28s]  Send thugs. Oh my god. But what about my career? Nah, I'm gonna do the right...
[2316.28s -> 2323.91s]  Not tonight, Jay. Now he's gonna work to undermine me.
[2331.70s -> 2335.54s]  Oh, how boring! I could be sitting in that seat right there with my coins.
[2337.91s -> 2342.95s]  The same cold meatloaf and cold peas and cold potatoes and cold gravy and
[2342.95s -> 2350.92s]  cold thyme leaves and cold plates and cold eyes staring back at me, angry with me.
[2359.66s -> 2367.77s]  Late evening at the judge's house. Uh-oh. What?
[2370.17s -> 2377.48s]  Do you not want to berate me like you always do? I'm glad you're home.
[2377.48s -> 2381.88s]  Are you aware that Frederick sometimes imagines you as a deep sea sailor?
[2381.88s -> 2385.37s]  He dreams that you visit distant countries and have wonderful adventures.
[2386.09s -> 2393.34s]  But he would rather have you by his side, on land. We all want that.
[2393.42s -> 2399.13s]  I don't want to watch the storm blow your lifeboat away and bury it beneath the waves.
[2399.13s -> 2402.31s]  There are no waves. The storm is getting closer.
[2402.31s -> 2407.24s]  Dark clouds already hang over the shore. Just wait until they finish building the guillotine.
[2408.04s -> 2411.40s]  Your oars will break at once and the waves will take you to a place you'll
[2411.40s -> 2427.05s]  soon wish you'd never set foot on. A place without us. Your family loves you.
[2427.05s -> 2430.17s]  But we won't find you in the darkness that has already begun to reach for you.
[2435.58s -> 2438.86s]  Relations with family. You have to choose an action. What?
[2440.06s -> 2447.72s]  Oh god. Upon returning home, you can decide how you would like to spend the rest of the day.
[2449.62s -> 2454.66s]  Each action will affect the other members of the family as well as their attitude towards you.
[2454.66s -> 2462.62s]  Okay. Each character's attitude can provide you with or deprive you of certain bonuses,
[2463.42s -> 2469.43s]  like reputation or relations with factions. Your youngest son is special.
[2469.43s -> 2474.47s]  His attitude makes the other family members, like you slightly more, take good care of him.
[2475.99s -> 2484.84s]  Okay, so hanging out with grandpa gives influence to the people.
[2484.84s -> 2488.31s]  Hanging out with Bernard is influence on the revolutionaries.
[2488.31s -> 2493.67s]  Hanging out with Matilda is influence on reputation and then influence on the family.
[2493.67s -> 2499.98s]  Opening night at the theater. There's a new play opening tonight on stage at the
[2499.98s -> 2505.85s]  Comme des Francaux. It is a good chance to take a breather from reality. Political debate.
[2505.85s -> 2510.12s]  It's time for the grown men to talk about the revolution's achievements.
[2510.12s -> 2516.81s]  It should be an interesting exchange. Spend your evening and your energy on carefree playtime
[2516.81s -> 2524.49s]  with your sons. Your wife's needs can wait. Reading together. There's nothing like sitting
[2524.49s -> 2530.15s]  with your family in a good book next to a warm fire, even though some may think it is dull.
[2530.15s -> 2540.79s]  Why don't we just all go out to the play? Everybody gets to go to the play.
[2540.79s -> 2554.49s]  Playtime with grandpa. Debate the child? No, the child is not. It's only these two.
[2554.49s -> 2560.22s]  No, all right. Let's involve everybody. Let's just hang out with the kids and just have fun.
[2561.62s -> 2568.38s]  We're gonna, okay. Why did you not? Oh, your wife's needs can wait. You weren't you not
[2568.38s -> 2581.74s]  involved? So that influenced, oh man, my god. This is just, there's a lot going on here.
[2586.44s -> 2591.72s]  Okay, today the people of Paris commemorate Jacques Guillemin Simon, Mayor of Vintampes.
[2591.72s -> 2596.63s]  He was lynched by a furious mob for performing his duties to France.
[2596.63s -> 2600.39s]  This march shall symbolize the unity of our society in the hope that the most
[2600.39s -> 2604.71s]  violent stage of the revolution is past us. Let us make sure that no other loyal
[2604.71s -> 2616.14s]  servant of France becomes a victim of such hatred ever again from King Louis.
[2616.14s -> 2620.78s]  Oh, Simon, you was a good loyal officer. Those bastards lynched him for observing the law.
[2620.78s -> 2629.88s]  Will you join me at the march? We have to show that we oppose the self-appointed
[2629.88s -> 2634.82s]  executioners and stand alongside. I wonder why the king has taken the trouble to show up.
[2635.96s -> 2639.64s]  Louis marching in arm and arm with the people of Paris, that is unexpected.
[2642.68s -> 2649.14s]  King Louis, continue please. I am merely an observer. Do not change your habits for me.
[2649.78s -> 2653.30s]  I heard a thing or two about a young and ambitious judge at the tribunal.
[2653.30s -> 2658.82s]  I was curious as to he guided by justice or by entertainment, as some would say.
[2659.38s -> 2675.19s]  Oh, we've got this theft and burglary. Hold on, we've got a dozen notifications here.
[2675.19s -> 2679.03s]  Good relationship with a younger son. Your younger son adores you like he used to back
[2679.03s -> 2688.65s]  in better days. This is a drawing, an invite. Oh, well thanks. That's nice of you.
[2691.40s -> 2696.06s]  Okay, so we've got a new case here. Got a good relationship with the son.
[2696.86s -> 2702.79s]  Is that, that's, that's, that's King Louis. I got some news here.
[2702.79s -> 2710.23s]  All right, neighborhood gossip. Uh-oh. Most parasi, I don't even know what that is,
[2711.83s -> 2715.91s]  ordinary. They have ordinary problems, ordinary consciences, and an ordinary's
[2715.91s -> 2720.39s]  resistance to pain. They were not hardened by the revolution. The father of the family
[2720.39s -> 2725.51s]  that spread the rumor about your weaknesses was no different. A few punches were more
[2725.51s -> 2734.73s]  than enough to convince his instincts that it was time to stop talking. Parisians.
[2739.80s -> 2742.76s]  Most, why does it just, why does the judge say most people from Paris?
[2743.72s -> 2752.06s]  Most Parisians. Is that what they're called? Parisians? I did not know that.
[2752.70s -> 2760.97s]  All right, so common folk endorsement went down by two, but my reputation went up.
[2760.97s -> 2768.38s]  So that may not have been a great idea. Common folk minus two, reputation plus one.
[2769.18s -> 2774.14s]  That's from the gossip of the neighborhood. All right, let's go.
[2775.10s -> 2779.43s]  All right, here we go. Who do we have here? We have, the defendant is Oliver Muggler,
[2779.43s -> 2785.43s]  a 65 year old master locksmith who was famed among Parisian burglars as an expert on
[2785.43s -> 2792.44s]  unopenable locks. Okay. Last month, he was commissioned by the owners of a Parisian
[2792.44s -> 2800.60s]  glassworks, Jean Rude, Louis Rowe, and Ferdinand Salon to construct locks for ornate chests for
[2800.60s -> 2805.72s]  valuables, presumably as gifts for their wives. The craftsman praised his latest creation as
[2805.72s -> 2811.08s]  thief proof. Shortly following their completion, the industrialist houses were hit by a series
[2811.08s -> 2817.40s]  of burglaries committed by a recent newcomer to Paris, Hector Vian. The thief from Orleans
[2817.96s -> 2826.44s]  was caught in the act and shot by Ferdinand Salon. An expensive
[2827.08s -> 2831.48s]  Turgo map of Paris, but the houses of the recently robbed industrialist marked on it was
[2831.48s -> 2837.80s]  found on the deceased. Surprisingly, Salon had given Muggler an identical map as advanced
[2837.80s -> 2844.60s]  payment. This deposit was an addition to the agreed remuneration from all the employers.
[2845.16s -> 2850.97s]  Okay. So he had somebody do his dirty work. All right. Let's see. So we have master locksmith
[2850.97s -> 2856.90s]  who is a famous locksmith. So a month ago, these three people commissioned him to make
[2856.90s -> 2868.23s]  an impossible lock. Oh, there's more. Oh, right. Okay. So let me just, let me just get this,
[2868.23s -> 2873.27s]  make sure I get this straight. So construct locks for ornate chests. So he's like,
[2873.27s -> 2876.39s]  yeah, I can make a lock for you and nobody will be able to break into it. Okay. Great.
[2877.58s -> 2880.54s]  After they were done, all their houses were hit by burglars
[2881.82s -> 2888.66s]  by a newcomer to Paris. Okay. This guy, Hector Vian, this is the thief from Orleans
[2889.86s -> 2893.14s]  and shot by Ferdinand Salon and anybody these people. Okay. So Ferdinand Salon
[2893.14s -> 2898.70s]  was one of the people that commissioned. So he was caught in the act at one of the houses.
[2900.30s -> 2905.83s]  I got it. Further interesting information came from the owner of the Ginger Margo Inn. She
[2905.83s -> 2909.59s]  recalled that on the night proceeding the burglary, the locksmith met there with a
[2909.59s -> 2915.43s]  man she didn't recognize. Based on her description, we were able to identify him as the affirmation
[2915.43s -> 2920.95s]  to Hector Vian. The men allegedly engaged in an evening of drinking sponsored by Muggler.
[2921.99s -> 2925.03s]  And then we have a map of Paris found on Hector Vian. Let's take a look.
[2926.20s -> 2935.93s]  Do I have that in my, uh, that's protocol. Where's, um, notebook somewhere. Kind of want
[2935.93s -> 2942.81s]  to see the, uh, kind of want to see it. All right. So even though this is very obvious
[2942.81s -> 2953.27s]  evening of drinking, a drunken evening. Uh, that's not an accusation marks on the map
[2953.27s -> 2959.19s]  series of burglaries. Uh, been to master locksmith. We got, we only got fucking a few
[2959.19s -> 2966.78s]  questions asked here. Sentence and thugs. No, the famous thief. Try like accused that,
[2966.78s -> 2978.39s]  you know who that is. This is that's evidence. Master locksmith is what about the drunken
[2978.39s -> 2991.43s]  evening, the construction of the locks series of bullets. That's that's, but that's like
[2991.43s -> 2997.75s]  a course, it's course of events. Okay. I still have six more questions to reveal and I can only
[2997.75s -> 3006.23s]  make three mistakes. Marks on the map or I mean, come on, like you got marks on the goddamn
[3006.23s -> 3018.34s]  map. That's an accusation, right? Like yeah, drunken evening, course of events. Yeah. Lock
[3018.34s -> 3031.75s]  construction, uh, personality, famous thief. I guess you could say that's extending winning
[3031.75s -> 3044.38s]  circumstances. Maybe law construction is course of events. It's probably course of events.
[3044.38s -> 3049.98s]  Yeah. And then finally the master locksmith is extended. Okay. We got them all. No mistakes.
[3051.93s -> 3056.25s]  Uh, the jury has not revealed it's for it gets okay. The acquittal is for common folk.
[3056.25s -> 3061.69s]  Think this guy's a common folk. Think this is a good guy and the revolutionaries, uh,
[3061.69s -> 3067.94s]  think don't want to think he's a bad guy. We got the king in the court here and I am ready
[3067.94s -> 3073.46s]  to start my questioning. Robbing the persuasion is no crime. According to the case file,
[3073.46s -> 3082.42s]  you are citizen Oliver Muggler. Is that correct? Uh, uh, voice and see. Indeed it is.
[3082.42s -> 3086.58s]  More sure as you may have a request. I'd like to sit down. I'm an old man. You see
[3087.69s -> 3092.49s]  basic respect for the judiciary requires that you remain standing. The names salon,
[3092.57s -> 3098.84s]  rude and row mean anything to you. Why are you so determined to harass an old man?
[3100.10s -> 3106.12s]  They sound like the names of my debtors. Debtors. They are the victims of activities.
[3106.12s -> 3117.11s]  You conducted. You mean look smithing. You were commissioned by the victims to make
[3117.11s -> 3120.55s]  chess locks. Did you know Hector Vian before? Do you recognize this map?
[3121.91s -> 3125.75s]  Were you the one who marked the addresses on the map? How much did you charge for
[3125.75s -> 3133.24s]  your services? We'll start. We're gonna start at a zero. How much did you charge for your services?
[3135.14s -> 3142.22s]  3000 francs. Tidy some that is. If you were a master locksmith, you charge that much too.
[3143.45s -> 3148.74s]  That is quite a substantial fee. Indeed. That's how much it costs to have high
[3148.74s -> 3153.30s]  quality locks made by a master with nearly 50 years of experience. And those bastards never
[3153.30s -> 3160.17s]  paid me a single franc. The victims did not pay you the agreed amount. Not a franc. I'd
[3160.17s -> 3165.05s]  beat that money right out of them, but I'm too old for that. So you didn't get paid?
[3168.12s -> 3177.11s]  Cases break it open wide. All right. Um, that rumor has it that you're one of the best locksmiths
[3177.11s -> 3185.43s]  in all of Paris. I should deny it for modesty's sake, but I will not. That cannot be true,
[3185.43s -> 3190.71s]  though, as a random thief from Orleans was easily able to open your locks. Well, then
[3190.71s -> 3195.83s]  he must have been one of the best thieves in Orleans. I should be serious. Every lock can
[3195.83s -> 3203.85s]  be picked with the right talents, even mine. Okay. So we're going down towards
[3204.65s -> 3213.82s]  revolutionaries here. All right. It's time. I think it's time we, uh, we bring out the big
[3213.82s -> 3223.58s]  guns here. Hmm. You were commissioned by the victims to make chest locks. Did you know
[3223.58s -> 3230.14s]  Hector Vian before? This is the first time I've heard the name. That's interesting as
[3230.14s -> 3233.26s]  you were seen draining several bottles of wine together at the Ginger Margo Inn.
[3233.98s -> 3238.50s]  Is that a crime? No, but the question is, why are you denying it now?
[3238.50s -> 3241.70s]  Was your drinking spree just a deception for discussing the burglary?
[3242.76s -> 3249.00s]  Nobody I had a drink with introduced themselves as Hector. I didn't plan on heist for Vector,
[3249.64s -> 3255.32s]  Victor or Hugo. I'm a locksmith and I earn good money from it. Burglaries are for vagrants
[3255.32s -> 3262.09s]  without a job. Okay. So you may have been drinking with them. There's no way to tell
[3262.09s -> 3272.04s]  that you knew them beforehand. Okay. You recognize this map? No, I don't recall ever
[3272.04s -> 3277.34s]  seeing it before. Ferdinand Salon claims that he gave you this map as advanced payment
[3277.34s -> 3284.30s]  for your services. He claims what? That wicked wretch of a second rate merchant. He gave me
[3284.30s -> 3289.26s]  a scrap of old paper as payment for making three locks and said it's supposed to be worth
[3289.26s -> 3294.73s]  more than 3000 francs he owes me. And honest labor is being judged while frauds remain
[3294.73s -> 3302.97s]  at large. Silence. So this map does belong to you. It doesn't. So where's the map that you
[3302.97s -> 3311.99s]  received from Citizen Salon? I lost it. Oh, what horse shit. I lost it. But it wasn't even worth
[3311.99s -> 3316.87s]  a loaf of bread. So I surely won't shed a tear. But if you have it, maybe you stole it from
[3316.87s -> 3324.55s]  me. You better make a note of that Oliver Muggler demands rumination from Rude, Roy and Salon.
[3326.70s -> 3340.62s]  All right. Hold on a second here. I didn't pay him though. Can I call somebody to the stands?
[3341.26s -> 3355.00s]  Can I? Did they not pay him? So circumstantially he could have been just drinking.
[3355.64s -> 3366.09s]  That might he just may have been out there hanging out. And maybe he he got the map stolen
[3366.09s -> 3380.98s]  from him by the guy he was drinking with. Right. And if he didn't get paid, then maybe
[3380.98s -> 3406.15s]  he's just kind of disgruntled. Common people don't like that. Prison is not something that
[3406.15s -> 3413.38s]  the common people want. I have more questions. Do I? Is there a penalty to? Well, I mean,
[3413.38s -> 3416.82s]  I guess look, right? So depending on how I want to have this play out here,
[3417.62s -> 3423.14s]  I could ask another question. This one. This is balanced, right? Let's bring this up a little
[3423.14s -> 3430.98s]  bit. Or the neutral ones. Did you give Hector the map? I gave nothing to Achilles, Hector or
[3430.98s -> 3439.99s]  any other Greek God. Call on the witness citizen Jean Rude. Oh, there we go. Jean Rude in the
[3439.99s -> 3447.08s]  flesh. He will not speak unless called upon. Naturally, of course. What went missing during the
[3447.08s -> 3454.81s]  burglary? My house was the first one to be robbed. And in my case, it was mostly valuables.
[3454.81s -> 3458.81s]  At Rue's house, he will not say it himself. And I do not want to go to prison.
[3458.81s -> 3465.46s]  It was the letters he had exchanged over the years with King Louis. Oh, damn monarchist.
[3466.26s -> 3472.46s]  Salon did not lose a thing. He shot that vermin in the act. That is what he said. What happened to
[3472.46s -> 3477.80s]  the items that he stole? That still remains unknown. According to Salon, Hector had nothing
[3477.80s -> 3485.24s]  with him. Ferdinand suspects he had hidden the other valuables somewhere. He hid the other
[3485.24s -> 3497.06s]  items before robbing the last house? Strange. Huh. Advanced payment in the form of a map,
[3497.06s -> 3500.74s]  its disappearance, the murder of a burglar, and a lack of payment for services.
[3501.72s -> 3506.81s]  You look upset. What are you afraid of? Yeah, look at all this shit.
[3508.98s -> 3516.38s]  And a lack of payment for services. It all makes for a rather strange story, a suspicious one,
[3516.38s -> 3522.47s]  too. I do not. What are you mumbling? If I say something, will I be free?
[3523.66s -> 3527.62s]  He knows something. Please testify what you know immediately.
[3530.68s -> 3535.16s]  The map was Salon's idea. He told the thief about the advanced payment we gave
[3535.16s -> 3542.68s]  the locksmith and proposed that Hector steal it. And he did? Indeed. But when the bastard robbed
[3542.68s -> 3547.72s]  us, later we were forced by Salon not to pay the locksmith because he sent the thief after
[3547.72s -> 3553.13s]  us. And that's when it all went down a drain. That's the bourgeoisie for you. He fooled them
[3553.13s -> 3559.34s]  all and went in one fell swoop. It sounds like citizen Salon had everything planned.
[3559.90s -> 3564.54s]  However, there's no evidence to support the claim. Perhaps it is citizen Rude that is
[3564.54s -> 3572.55s]  plotting against his partner and wants to frame him. And Vion is dead, so he will not be able to
[3572.55s -> 3580.97s]  shed light on any of this. If I was younger, I'd give that Salon a drubbin. I'd peep that
[3580.97s -> 3586.12s]  good-for-nothing lying bastard. Please restrain yourself. The testimony of a witness is still
[3586.12s -> 3595.70s]  not evidence. Neither of citizen Salon's guilt nor of your innocence. Oh shit. Well,
[3599.27s -> 3603.43s]  I don't I don't think that you are I don't think you committed a crime here.
[3603.99s -> 3613.98s]  This is the jury's opinion. Yeah. Yeah, I think we got enough information here.
[3614.62s -> 3627.26s]  That's an acquittal. Ask the neutral questions? I don't think I even need to. Did you tell
[3627.26s -> 3631.66s]  Hector how to open the locks? I understand what you're implying, but consider this. If
[3631.66s -> 3636.30s]  he sold the secret of my locks, then my business would be over. Wood spreads fast among
[3636.30s -> 3644.44s]  thieves. Yeah, I guess I could probably ask one of these. I don't think it would go up much higher.
[3645.16s -> 3649.67s]  I need to know. Were you the one who marked the addresses on the maps? No,
[3650.55s -> 3661.54s]  no, he didn't do shit. He's he's innocent. Yep, we're gonna be I got some we lost with
[3661.54s -> 3666.17s]  the revolutionaries though. Risk of being removed from office. We can't let this go down that
[3666.17s -> 3679.35s]  far. Kill him just in case. This is risky, because that makes it I gotta think about my career.
[3680.07s -> 3686.50s]  All right, acquittal. That's my verdict. There's way there's way too much going on here.
[3686.50s -> 3697.91s]  The verdict for citizen Oliver Muggler is not guilty. Lead the defendant away.
[3698.73s -> 3706.09s]  Bravo, Muggler. Away with the bourgeoisie. If I may, to be honest, this does bear the marks of
[3706.09s -> 3715.05s]  social justice. They would not pay him so he had them robbed. There is a balance here. Grandpa,
[3715.05s -> 3727.24s]  that's not really what happened. Common folk. Okay, lost with the revolutionaries, but gained
[3727.24s -> 3733.54s]  with common folk. Senile old man couldn't even hear the case. Is that am I good to go?
[3734.26s -> 3740.47s]  Well, that's because I lost some common folk. So I just gained it back. What am I doing on
[3740.47s -> 3748.23s]  the hierarchy? I'm still just oh, wait a minute, hold on. Who are these two? David. Oh, that's the
[3748.23s -> 3756.17s]  guy that came to me and said, who is this guy with the sunglasses on? He's widely referred to
[3756.17s -> 3761.93s]  as the incorruptible. As leader of the radical Jacobins. He preserves order in the national
[3761.93s -> 3766.89s]  convention with an iron fist and of need be terror. Undeniably the most powerful man in
[3766.89s -> 3781.16s]  Paris in the age of revolution. As yet none have dared defy him. That's me. So this is my friend
[3781.80s -> 3784.79s]  and I don't know who that is. I guess I don't know who that is yet. All right,
[3784.79s -> 3788.47s]  we've got plenty of good names here. All right, congratulations, you're free.
[3789.11s -> 3800.20s]  I think that's good. Let's get out of here. Next. Look, an authentic map by Togo. It would
[3800.20s -> 3807.99s]  be a pity if it rotted in a safe deposit box. We cannot do that. These are court deposits.
[3809.02s -> 3811.90s]  Well, the tilde did tell me long ago to take care of my study at home.
[3812.98s -> 3816.90s]  There you go. I know someone who can remove these marks without damaging the map.
[3820.62s -> 3827.11s]  The king is just still hanging out here. Is he sleeping? King Louis the 16th. There were people
[3827.11s -> 3846.57s]  who truly loved him. He reminded the French they had noble ancestors. Do not be manipulated
[3846.57s -> 3853.34s]  by people who are not bearing the burden of responsibility. Good George Washington right there.
[3853.34s -> 3861.99s]  Well, this saddened me. Someone had advised him to say that. Someone who was well aware
[3861.99s -> 3873.11s]  of the cold, inevitable wind of change. I did not pity the king, but those who will come after
[3873.11s -> 3886.31s]  him as they will not have great ancestors. Okay, one of us. A Frenchman marched in the
[3886.31s -> 3891.03s]  streets of Paris side by side, one line after another to commemorate Jacques Guillemin
[3891.59s -> 3896.95s]  a mayor of Entemps. He was murdered by a furious mob, punished for a law he did not enact,
[3896.95s -> 3901.99s]  but was obliged to observe. Freedom of speech killed him. If we understand this as the right
[3901.99s -> 3906.71s]  to cast stones to show one's discontent, the right to murder people because you deem them
[3906.71s -> 3911.83s]  responsible for your miserable life, surely the people of Paris would prefer if we said that
[3911.83s -> 3929.06s]  nothing happened. Lost common folk. Gain revolutionary. Your son is rather good with
[3929.06s -> 3936.62s]  the violin. He is both talented and enthusiastic. I'd prefer that he was as enthusiastic about the
[3936.62s -> 3942.15s]  law books I give him. I look so defeated. Maybe his destiny is to become an artist,
[3942.15s -> 3947.69s]  not a lawyer. Mother likes to hear me playing, and there is nothing more boring than law.
[3948.97s -> 3955.27s]  See? He would rather let his career rely on the humours of the people. There are many ways
[3955.27s -> 3959.83s]  to re-zoo-escue France. Believe me, our country desperately needs something to ennoble
[3959.83s -> 3965.67s]  it. The power is in the hands of simple, illiterate people. Let him rescue their souls with music.
[3968.14s -> 3974.52s]  That's better than boring laws and clauses. See what you're doing? You are spoiling my child.
[3974.52s -> 3981.80s]  I do not have my own children to spoil, so I am focusing on yours. Speaking of which...
[3981.80s -> 3991.82s]  Oh, no, no, no, no. Here we go. Locked action. After various important events,
[3991.82s -> 3996.54s]  you may find yourself in an action forced upon you. On this day, you become the victim of
[3996.54s -> 4005.72s]  your own decisions. Oh, c'est manuel. You cannot change. You attended the parade in memory of
[4005.72s -> 4019.03s]  the lynched official. So that's what we did. That's what we're going to do. People influence
[4020.23s -> 4025.67s]  Bernard, influence on revolutionaries. Wife is not that happy. Son's doing all right.
[4028.57s -> 4040.28s]  Liberté. Day three. That is our new symbol of freedom. You can still smell the fresh wood.
[4041.00s -> 4047.34s]  Do you feel free looking at it? Individuals like us do not need symbols, but France does.
[4049.59s -> 4054.31s]  Did you hear the news of the day? People are running around like headless chickens
[4054.31s -> 4057.11s]  and yelling about Louis and his entourage escaping Paris.
[4057.83s -> 4060.87s]  So we will not be enjoying the aroma of fresh wood for long.
[4061.75s -> 4066.23s]  Monuments like that are not installed solely for the purpose of punishing thieves or lesser
[4066.23s -> 4074.38s]  aristocrats. Do you think it wants to taste royal blood? Louis' flight was a stupid move,
[4074.38s -> 4080.46s]  yet it seems it was planned. One of us will sacrifice him. That is, if they catch him.
[4082.76s -> 4091.45s]  Is that why Louis visited us at the court? To manipulate us? Maybe deep in his heart he
[4091.45s -> 4096.49s]  felt what the builders of the guillotine did. That someone has to be exposed as a traitor,
[4097.05s -> 4112.31s]  even if there is none. Interesting. Okay. This is Antoine. Welcome, citizen Fidel. My name is
[4112.31s -> 4118.95s]  Antoine Quentin Faquer de Tinville. I am the public prosecutor that has been assigned to assist
[4118.95s -> 4127.06s]  at every tribunal trial starting from today. Okay. I should warn you that I am uncompromising,
[4127.06s -> 4131.70s]  although I hope that we quickly find common ground. In happier news, the construction of
[4131.70s -> 4136.60s]  the guillotine has been finished. We may begin using it today. Yes, we've seen it.
[4138.84s -> 4143.56s]  The king is gone. Treason. Anyone with information about his whereabouts should
[4143.56s -> 4153.88s]  immediately disclose it to the authorities. From Rasputin. Okay. Anyone with information
[4153.88s -> 4160.06s]  about his whereabouts should immediately disclose it to the authorities. Okay.
[4160.06s -> 4169.94s]  So I'm assuming this is a little law here. What does this start? Okay, so this is
[4170.82s -> 4181.75s]  burglary. Notifications. Let's see. Uh, good relations with the father. Yours,
[4181.75s -> 4193.54s]  pride and joy. Keep it up. Anything else? Okay. So father and son, both very, very happy.
[4197.10s -> 4202.70s]  So we've got death penalty, prison, and then acquittal. That's the common vogue and
[4202.70s -> 4210.49s]  revolutionaries. The jury has not revealed its verdict yet. We need to use the new toy. Oh,
[4210.49s -> 4221.54s]  God. Do it. Do it with no questions.
[4226.66s -> 4238.07s]  Immediately do it. You got, hold on a second. They just, they're not even done building it.
[4240.44s -> 4251.32s]  I want blood. Do it. Do it. At least once. No. What? There is no save game.
[4255.19s -> 4268.92s]  Do it. They just built it. Oh my God, guys. That's gonna,
[4282.92s -> 4284.52s]  the defendant confessed to the crimes.
[4289.96s -> 4299.75s]  No. What made the defendant famous in the eyes of the people? Uh, uh, this one. How did the
[4299.75s -> 4323.00s]  defendant explain signs of assault? Um, I don't know. I don't know. I sentence citizen
[4323.00s -> 4330.46s]  John Ilver to be guillotined. I just got an achievement for doing that by the way. The
[4330.54s -> 4335.02s]  evidence against him was not conclusive. Outrageous. What are you doing? You fool,
[4335.02s -> 4339.66s]  traitor of the people, murderer of our hero. A verdict already? What about the trial?
[4342.90s -> 4349.27s]  Bad job. I got an achievement for that. It said, I think if you guillotine somebody within
[4349.27s -> 4363.32s]  10 seconds of it starting, you get an achievement. Rumors are spreading. Rumors
[4363.32s -> 4366.68s]  about your careless approach to your duties are spreading. You'd better shape it up if you
[4366.68s -> 4376.86s]  want to keep your job. That wasn't worth it. Maybe it was for the achievement.
[4379.85s -> 4397.29s]  Well, no, maybe I could win the heart of the crowd. Earn the favor of the crowd by delivering
[4397.29s -> 4407.08s]  a speech or proceed directly to the execution. I have to give a speech on me? Just remember,
[4407.08s -> 4411.00s]  once you start your speech, there's no going back. An awkward or clumsy speech will earn
[4411.00s -> 4415.40s]  you nothing but ridicule from the audience. Depending on your reputation, the crowd will
[4415.40s -> 4432.55s]  be more or less aggressive. Strategy building? What? Before attempting persuasion, you may
[4432.55s -> 4437.59s]  explore different approaches to all the topics of the conversation. After employing every
[4437.59s -> 4442.41s]  kind of emotion, you will receive an evaluation of your choices. Okay.
[4444.20s -> 4448.28s]  Each attitude comes with a set of emotions that have a positive and negative impact.
[4448.28s -> 4451.48s]  Learn their effects to manipulate the people of Paris in any way you please.
[4452.20s -> 4455.64s]  The higher your reputation, the more you know about the other speaker's attitude.
[4456.20s -> 4459.00s]  You can also obtain this information by spending influence points.
[4461.50s -> 4471.38s]  Okay. Choose topic. Humility. The defendant. Manipulation. Revolution. Okay. Oh my God.
[4475.50s -> 4492.01s]  Crime. Aggression. Defendant. Humility. Revolution. Manipulation. I got points,
[4492.01s -> 4501.98s]  right? Oversensitive. Okay. So they go. A strong argument. Good. And they're attached.
[4502.62s -> 4507.82s]  So maybe actually, yeah. Manipulate humility and we'll go with some aggression here.
[4514.10s -> 4519.24s]  If they're oversensitive, why would I want to be aggressive? If they're attached,
[4519.24s -> 4525.86s]  why would I want to be aggressive? No. What are you talking about? I don't think I need
[4525.86s -> 4544.30s]  it. Here we go. Today marks the what? What's going on? When there is a crime,
[4544.30s -> 4550.54s]  there must be punishment and we shall dish it out. Oh, yes. Even the convict's ancestor
[4550.54s -> 4560.76s]  Scheffler, the cold edge of the guillotine slicing through their necks. The criminals
[4560.76s -> 4569.48s]  belong in the grave. Only then we build a better future. The reign of the previous
[4569.48s -> 4574.36s]  rulers whose goal was to bring injustice to the people ends with their swift deaths.
[4577.98s -> 4584.97s]  They were doubtful. All right. I understand. You can reveal it.
[4587.08s -> 4591.64s]  You decapitated a man for a scuffle in the streets. People, I rescued you and now you
[4591.64s -> 4611.74s]  murder me. What? Off with his head. Pull the revolution. Oh, I have to do this.
[4612.62s -> 4640.25s]  I'm just the judge. Pull the ro- Due to the establishment of a revolutionary tribunal,
[4640.25s -> 4644.49s]  we need to prepare an official stamp. I was told to ask you, citizen,
[4645.05s -> 4655.48s]  because President DeVoy is indisposed. How much did he drink? He was not able to say,
[4655.48s -> 4671.10s]  shall we? Design your stamp. Okay. My base. I want it to be three dots. I like this. I like
[4671.10s -> 4680.04s]  that. Emblem, the crow, the chicken, the compass, the horn, the scale, the book,
[4681.46s -> 4693.29s]  the White House, the owl, the quarter, the judge, the tree, the surrender, the time,
[4693.29s -> 4706.49s]  the key, the lady, the goblet of fire, the lion, defense, eagle, bow and arrow,
[4709.80s -> 4724.55s]  musket man, and then two crayons. I think I'm going to do two crayons. I like, no,
[4724.55s -> 4733.94s]  something a little small. I like that. Change the base. If we're going to have two,
[4733.94s -> 4740.97s]  if we're going to have the crayon crossed, then it needs to, that's all right. That looks
[4740.97s -> 4752.57s]  good. Thank you for your time. I know it's late. The stamp should be ready tomorrow.
[4752.57s -> 4764.54s]  Good night. Look, okay. Work on tomorrow's trial. All right. Now that I got that, like,
[4764.54s -> 4771.03s]  you can't ask for that again. You used your one chat joke Trump card, right? Not again.
[4771.03s -> 4779.03s]  So work on tomorrow's trial. You will unlock more question effects in court. I have to do
[4779.03s -> 4796.23s]  this because I need to make sure this trial is done correctly. The wife. Go gamble. Evening
[4796.23s -> 4801.11s]  gambling. You should spend some time with your father every now and then. Show him your world.
[4801.11s -> 4808.60s]  Perhaps you will get a taste for it. Your world. Go lie down face up with the neck in guillotine
[4810.25s -> 4826.30s]  and pray for soft winds. Paragraphs and codes. Needs to learn some more
[4826.30s -> 4833.50s]  perspective skills and law can be taught. And law can be an art in its own right.
[4833.50s -> 4838.02s]  Your eldest wife is going to hate you? I only have one wife. What are you talking about?
[4838.02s -> 4841.30s]  You take your family for an evening stroll around Paris. It will let your father stretch
[4841.30s -> 4857.94s]  his bones a little. Let's take the family up. Wow, he hated that. He liked it. Okay. What about
[4857.94s -> 4869.94s]  the son? Nice. Almost got a fall bar. He's old. He hates walking. You only read chat when
[4869.94s -> 4874.66s]  they give you shitty joke advice. Why? I read chat the whole day. What? What are you talking
[4874.66s -> 4884.82s]  about? That was okay. That was a unanimous chat decision. All right. There was only a couple
[4884.82s -> 4890.90s]  of one guys that didn't want me to do that. You cannot go back to your chat logs and you
[4890.90s -> 4897.59s]  look at that unanimous chat display. It was, I didn't even need to do a poll. It was so
[4897.59s -> 4905.86s]  overwhelming. I got the achievement. I got like the kill a guy without even looking.
[4905.86s -> 4919.85s]  Achievement. All right. Anyway, let's go. I wasn't joking and I'm glad you killed him.
[4924.33s -> 4930.79s]  All right. All right. Here's Matthew. Tragically, we are losing control of the streets.
[4931.35s -> 4936.47s]  People feel betrayed by the king and some believe him to be a spy trying to elude justice.
[4937.35s -> 4943.67s]  Special means are recommended when suppressing unrest. We only need an opinion from the judges
[4943.67s -> 4947.59s]  to make sure. I'm going to read that again because I have to do that again. I wasn't paying
[4947.59s -> 4952.39s]  attention. Special means are recommended when suppressing unrest. We only need an opinion
[4952.39s -> 4957.32s]  from the judges to make sure we are working legally. In other words, you need their
[4957.32s -> 4962.39s]  blessing to shoot at protesters. People can't control their emotions and are hurting at the
[4962.39s -> 4967.11s]  citizens as a result. Look at the windows. Next time they might do something worse than
[4967.11s -> 4975.69s]  just throw rocks. It pains us to see unrest growing in the streets of Paris.
[4976.25s -> 4980.57s]  Commander in Chief Burel has informed us that the guard is no longer able to control the
[4980.57s -> 4985.05s]  situation through peaceful means. It is recommended that he be allowed to use more
[4985.05s -> 4989.21s]  immediate methods to protect the innocent civilians. But we would like to know the
[4989.21s -> 4994.94s]  tribunal's opinion on the matter. I approve of the National Guard's use of force against
[4995.58s -> 5013.53s]  running, ruining the capital. Accept it. Chat deserves karma.
[5014.89s -> 5034.09s]  No, no, I'm with Grandpa on this one. Yeah, no. The authority should not use force against
[5034.09s -> 5051.80s]  the people. If it has to, it already has lost. I do not approve of this decree.
[5051.80s -> 5057.08s]  Oh, right. I just put it on my signature. It's the first time I've done this. I don't know.
[5059.96s -> 5063.40s]  Without this document, we can only wait for the citizens of Paris to start killing each
[5063.40s -> 5069.32s]  other before our very eyes. I hope you know what you're doing. The convention may have issued
[5069.32s -> 5081.42s]  that decree, but I have no doubt it was Robert Svearie's idea. Executes a guy with literally
[5081.42s -> 5089.59s]  no trial. Whoa, violence against civilians. Ah, that's not okay. That wasn't me. I was
[5089.59s -> 5098.65s]  out sick that day. Chat took over that day. I was out sick. The mob wanted to act as both
[5098.65s -> 5103.53s]  judge and jury again and hang people from the street lamps. Poor Pochard was almost hanged.
[5104.25s -> 5111.11s]  Pochard? Claude Pochard? Exactly. The beloved tutor of your Frederick. You had to dismiss him
[5111.11s -> 5116.70s]  after the incident with the oath of the clergy, did you not? Yes, Frederick tells me from time
[5116.70s -> 5123.10s]  to time that he misses his teacher. What are you doing? The trial is about to begin.
[5123.10s -> 5130.10s]  It's about Monsieur Pochard. News travels fast. He's been accused of counter-revolutionary
[5130.10s -> 5137.61s]  activities. You know him. It can't be true. It's not so simple. Leave before somebody hears
[5137.61s -> 5150.55s]  us. Papa, please go home. Think about the family for once at least. Papa. Uh oh.
[5154.57s -> 5158.17s]  Good relationship with the elder son. Got good relationship. Okay. All right. Let's see here.
[5158.17s -> 5167.18s]  We got the family wants acquittal. This is the revolutionaries want prison and the common folk
[5167.18s -> 5179.02s]  want the death penalty. Okay. Interesting. You are, please introduce yourself. This is Claude
[5179.02s -> 5184.52s]  Pochard. Monsieur les jours, you know me. State your personal information or there will be
[5184.52s -> 5190.74s]  consequences. Claude Pochard. Monsieur les jours. You stand accused of spying for the
[5190.74s -> 5195.06s]  counter-revolutionaries and criticizing the existing order. Do you admit to these crimes?
[5196.49s -> 5201.37s]  I am innocent. The accusation is exaggerated and comes from the ill will of the accusers.
[5202.81s -> 5208.25s]  Suggesting that the revolutionary government is acting in ill will. Typical of a priest.
[5212.68s -> 5220.20s]  All right. Let's see. Okay. Counter-revolution and treason.
[5223.62s -> 5231.86s]  Claude Pochard, a 26-year-old vicar and tutor, son of a cobbler, believes in enlightenment ideals.
[5232.50s -> 5239.86s]  After refusing to endure the civil constitution of the clergy, he was removed from his parish,
[5239.86s -> 5244.82s]  prohibited from carrying out his duties, and sentenced to banishment. Despite this,
[5245.62s -> 5251.62s]  he stayed in Paris and continued his work as a tutor, which he started before 1789.
[5252.66s -> 5258.18s]  Pochard was captured in the streets by fortuitous circumstance. A guard officer
[5258.18s -> 5263.78s]  present during his trial a few months ago recognized him and didn't hesitate to act.
[5264.50s -> 5268.90s]  Following an investigation, Pochard was accused of spying and spreading
[5268.90s -> 5274.66s]  counter-revolutionary propaganda in order to prepare for an intervention that would end
[5274.66s -> 5282.02s]  the revolution. Correspondence with Archbishop Jean Arsène des Bretus was found in a room
[5282.02s -> 5288.02s]  Pochard had been renting from Marie Gimmett. In it, the clergyman asked for information about
[5288.02s -> 5295.46s]  the unrest and the supporters of the monarchy in hiding. Riches were also found, a golden
[5295.54s -> 5308.02s]  chalice and a reliquary. Moreover, the director of one of the orphanages Claude
[5308.02s -> 5312.74s]  Toddin testified that the tutor would question the law of the revolution in front of the students,
[5313.38s -> 5319.94s]  stating that it was less important than the laws handed down by God. A letter to Claude
[5319.94s -> 5320.42s]  Pochard.
[5367.99s -> 5370.55s]  prepare for a foreign intervention that would end the revolution.
[5371.78s -> 5379.27s]  They would riches also found. Let's take a look. So ban it, let's see, see, see. Okay.
[5380.20s -> 5389.70s]  A letter from the church riches spreading propaganda espionage. Tudor. Tudor. It's
[5390.26s -> 5397.10s]  banishment. So you were banished for speaking against, right? So this is this would be
[5397.10s -> 5413.50s]  counterrevolution. Fog. It's Tudor. Tutor. Tutor. Church riches. That's evidence.
[5416.18s -> 5426.15s]  Spreading propaganda. That's counterrevolution. Espionage. That's an accusation. Four more
[5426.15s -> 5436.41s]  questions possible. Parish priest. It's a personality question. Another possibility
[5436.41s -> 5448.26s]  for propaganda. I mean, that's an accusation. Letter from the archbishop. That looks like
[5448.26s -> 5455.40s]  evidence to me. Banishment is a course of events. We got them all. All right. We don't
[5455.40s -> 5468.31s]  know where the jury stands at the moment. So we can just let's just do what do you teach? Why
[5468.31s -> 5473.99s]  did the accused stay in France despite being banished? Sekiro unlocks in three hours.
[5476.39s -> 5483.64s]  Wow. No, but I can't. I can't. Don't even tell me that. Don't tell me that. I already
[5483.64s -> 5491.32s]  got it loaded. Don't tell me that. All right. So why? That's a good question. Why are you still
[5491.32s -> 5497.82s]  here? What are you? Why are you still here? I had to take care of my sick mother. Without me,
[5497.82s -> 5504.73s]  she would surely have died. Why did you not take her with you? Good. Make the filth squirm.
[5505.29s -> 5510.25s]  I was in no position to afford that. I'm just a poor parish priest who is unable to
[5510.25s -> 5516.23s]  even carry out his duties. I have to teach every single day to survive. Is that why you
[5516.23s -> 5522.89s]  started spying for money? No. What information could I glean that would be useful to
[5524.49s -> 5532.02s]  emigres? That of the supposed persecution of priests. The main argument that Archbishop
[5532.02s -> 5538.26s]  de Pertoux and Pius VI are using to convince Catholic monarchs to strike against the
[5538.26s -> 5545.74s]  revolution. I do not correspond with emigres and I certainly do not write about the
[5545.82s -> 5550.50s]  suffering of our clergymen. I would like to remind you that we have evidence.
[5551.38s -> 5568.76s]  Away with the liar. Okay. We already got that one. Mother was sick. What do you teach?
[5569.32s -> 5574.25s]  The caregivers in orphanages only pay for reading and writing lessons.
[5575.32s -> 5580.28s]  So why did the accused teach children that God's laws stands above that of the republic?
[5580.84s -> 5583.56s]  You spread superstition and counter-revolutionary propaganda.
[5584.12s -> 5588.94s]  This is a misunderstanding. The children I teach are unable to understand such complicated
[5588.94s -> 5595.53s]  matters. The accused's explanation further incriminates him. If they are unable to
[5595.53s -> 5600.22s]  understand the topic, why would he even discuss it at all? The church spreads
[5600.22s -> 5605.22s]  ignorance and takes our money. I was only answering questions from the director of
[5605.22s -> 5610.82s]  the orphanages in Gambines. I said that God's laws stood above my banishment.
[5610.82s -> 5614.82s]  It is God's law that prohibits me from leaving the country. I have a duty to help
[5614.82s -> 5627.90s]  those in need. Okay. We're currently leaning towards acquittal at the moment. I need more
[5627.90s -> 5643.22s]  info. All right. So hold on. Who? Okay. This is my family would think this is a good idea
[5643.22s -> 5648.92s]  because this is a friend of the family. Common folk want the death penalty currently
[5648.92s -> 5658.12s]  leaning. All right. Here we go. What information did the accused manage to convey to Archbishop
[5658.12s -> 5658.84s]  de Bluthy?
[5691.19s -> 5697.08s]  to the letter? What a coincidence. Archbishop de Bluthy currently resides
[5698.18s -> 5704.04s]  in Switzerland. It is indeed a coincidence. Many clergymen reside in Switzerland.
[5705.48s -> 5724.76s]  You believe that? I mean, that's come on. The accused travels extensively around the world,
[5724.76s -> 5731.59s]  around the Paris department. To what end? Why? I teach wherever I can find students. Doing
[5731.59s -> 5736.23s]  that requires time and effort, I admit. Is that why you received gold from your fellow
[5736.23s -> 5743.19s]  conspirators abroad? He travels around France to spy on people. The only money I see comes
[5743.19s -> 5748.39s]  from my students' caregivers. It's not at all immodest. So where did the riches found in
[5748.39s -> 5756.58s]  your room come from? They were litigar- they were lit- they were literally accountants.
[5757.14s -> 5762.34s]  Oh, yeah. They were liturgic- they were liturgical accrotrements. I- everyone's gonna
[5762.34s -> 5767.69s]  make fun of me now. They were liturgical accrotrements. I saved them from the
[5767.69s -> 5771.29s]  plunder of the church and compents. I would rather go hungry than sell them.
[5772.76s -> 5787.16s]  They were literally- okay. Fanatic, thief, peddler of superstition. Boy, I know what
[5787.16s -> 5794.07s]  donation words I'm using next time. What- what does that mean? All right. Hold on.
[5798.62s -> 5811.62s]  All right, some of the witness. Marie Gimé. Citizen, what is your name? Marie Gimé.
[5811.62s -> 5819.22s]  Monsieur Lejeu. Was the witness aware that she was renting a room to an unsworn Catholic priest?
[5819.86s -> 5832.82s]  Did the accused maintain extensive correspondence? What if this is a- what if this is also a spy?
[5833.38s -> 5840.14s]  I'm gonna say this one. Did the accused maintain extensive correspondence? Meaning?
[5841.19s -> 5847.62s]  Did he receive many letters? I don't remember any letters with his name. Perhaps he had a
[5847.62s -> 5852.79s]  rich social life. Did he entertain many guests? I don't remember anyone visiting him at all.
[5853.51s -> 5856.55s]  He wasn't there most of the time anyway. He just used the room to sleep.
[5857.77s -> 5861.50s]  Where would he go? I don't ask my guests about things like that.
[5862.06s -> 5872.22s]  Did he pay rent on time? Did he ever criticize the revolution and its accomplishments?
[5877.27s -> 5880.23s]  Wow, did he pay his rent on time? I feel like this is much more-
[5881.03s -> 5894.31s]  this makes more sense. Did he pay rent on time? Did he pay rent on time? Sometimes I had to
[5894.31s -> 5899.80s]  threaten to kick him out, but eventually he would always pay. So the accused did not strike
[5899.80s -> 5904.20s]  you as a person who has a substantial amount of money to operate with or spend freely?
[5906.01s -> 5910.49s]  No, he lived like a poor man. I mean, a normal fellow would never get rich from teaching.
[5912.41s -> 5924.14s]  Okay. What stipend does the accused receive? So he is- maybe he's hiding it though.
[5924.14s -> 5931.70s]  What do you get from being a teacher?
[5938.26s -> 5948.66s]  I'm realizing this now. Yeah, this is not England. Let me rephrase this.
[5955.91s -> 5957.11s]  I don't know how to do a French accent.
[5960.47s -> 5963.43s]  I can't do that. I'm going back to English.
[5998.84s -> 6001.08s]  Why did the accused continue teaching instead of leaving?
[6002.54s -> 6005.90s]  All right. I think people are going to start chanting for his head here. I got to-
[6005.90s -> 6006.86s]  Hold on. Where's the evidence?
[6020.95s -> 6025.14s]  Oh, I can do this. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
[6049.29s -> 6051.90s]  It's not sacrament, merely prayer.
[6057.74s -> 6058.30s]  Stupid!
[6065.70s -> 6076.20s]  Oh. Why did the accused continue teaching? Why did you do this?
[6085.45s -> 6087.61s]  Your knowledge is a Catholic propaganda!
[6088.65s -> 6091.93s]  I prefer the term- all right, hold on. They are both of the same-
[6096.14s -> 6099.10s]  I'm trailing into like Jamaican. You're right. All right. Hold on.
[6099.90s -> 6103.98s]  I prefer the term. I prefer the term Catholic values.
[6111.24s -> 6116.33s]  Okay. Jury's opinion is- doesn't- don't need to kill him.
[6117.42s -> 6120.54s]  Family wants to be acquitted. Hold on. Let me see anything else I can do here.
[6124.68s -> 6126.36s]  Did the defendant confess? No.
[6127.00s -> 6128.68s]  Was his act counter-revolutionary?
[6130.20s -> 6132.60s]  When and where did the defendant corrupt the people of Paris?
[6133.32s -> 6139.45s]  During arguments? No. It would be here.
[6140.25s -> 6142.71s]  During the reading and writing lessons in the orphanage, right?
[6145.78s -> 6147.14s]  During arguments? No.
[6149.62s -> 6151.54s]  Maybe they went during- yeah, in the orphanage.
[6152.10s -> 6155.35s]  Was his act counter-revolutionary?
[6155.35s -> 6163.03s]  I mean, yeah. Yeah, close.
[6165.27s -> 6166.23s]  I'm not going to kill you.
[6173.19s -> 6177.19s]  All right, acquittal. Wow. That would be bad.
[6177.19s -> 6181.24s]  Prison. Death penalty.
[6181.96s -> 6185.00s]  Nah, I can get some points of revolutionary here.
[6185.64s -> 6188.36s]  But I need to do- the common folk need to be appeased.
[6189.08s -> 6198.02s]  The people want blood, but they're not going to get it because
[6199.30s -> 6204.46s]  the revolutionaries will actually come and remove me from office.
[6204.46s -> 6207.02s]  The joke fucked you up so bad. Yeah.
[6209.72s -> 6211.93s]  Sorry. Prison.
[6214.17s -> 6222.52s]  Sorry, family. That could be anybody's name.
[6225.74s -> 6228.86s]  I sentence Citizen Claude Pochard to prison.
[6229.50s -> 6231.98s]  Lead the condemned out.
[6232.70s -> 6235.14s]  He saved that priest!
[6235.14s -> 6237.70s]  He showed mercy to an enemy of the revolution.
[6238.58s -> 6241.70s]  He ought to have been killed. I have nothing else to say.
[6242.58s -> 6246.92s]  All right. Correct, correct, correct.
[6246.92s -> 6247.80s]  Three to three. Good job.
[6248.52s -> 6250.76s]  My influence went up. My reputation went up.
[6251.72s -> 6253.00s]  I played that pretty much by the book.
[6254.07s -> 6255.75s]  So for the next case, unfortunately,
[6256.47s -> 6258.55s]  I'm going to have to play some politics here and we need-
[6258.55s -> 6264.62s]  I need- we need to sway people towards like execution for them.
[6264.62s -> 6274.97s]  Cool. This game's fun.
[6277.96s -> 6279.88s]  I like this. This is actually really interesting.
[6280.68s -> 6286.33s]  Okay, so I still- I'm still at the bottom here.
[6290.89s -> 6296.39s]  Take him away.
[6296.39s -> 6297.75s]  Is it as fun as Sekiro?
[6297.75s -> 6299.91s]  I can't start Sekiro three hours from now.
[6301.32s -> 6303.64s]  I'll be almost five hours into the stream.
[6304.84s -> 6306.12s]  I can't start Sekiro.
[6306.60s -> 6309.88s]  I'm gonna have to- if I start Sekiro in three or four hours,
[6310.52s -> 6315.24s]  I will actually burn out for tomorrow and I won't stream tomorrow.
[6315.24s -> 6317.40s]  I'll be- I'll be live for like 16 hours or something.
[6317.40s -> 6318.92s]  It'll- no, I can't.
[6319.96s -> 6330.66s]  Who's that? Who's that?
[6330.66s -> 6348.50s]  That was a dad. No, it's not.
[6348.50s -> 6350.90s]  One fool spewed out one word to many.
[6351.62s -> 6352.82s]  The other fired a musket.
[6354.02s -> 6364.30s]  They fought for freedom, each for their own.
[6365.10s -> 6371.32s]  The man who was forbidden to shoot.
[6372.20s -> 6377.42s]  Commander Buell paid the highest price for our decisions.
[6378.22s -> 6381.34s]  The defender who kept watch over ordinary citizens,
[6381.34s -> 6383.58s]  but was denied the right to protect himself.
[6385.85s -> 6389.13s]  Whether I like it or not, his death is also my fault.
[6394.66s -> 6401.67s]  That's because I've rejected the- we made a nice profit.
[6401.67s -> 6403.11s]  There was a chance of prosperity.
[6404.49s -> 6409.05s]  Why would the Renard family want to take over your shop, grandpapa?
[6410.25s -> 6411.85s]  For profit and power.
[6411.85s -> 6414.17s]  It's always the same and it's no different in these times.
[6414.89s -> 6418.70s]  We get the same like hair energy coming to realize.
[6419.80s -> 6424.52s]  Today is about equality so that not only the aristocrats can live with dignity.
[6427.70s -> 6429.94s]  Grow up. Grow up, boy.
[6429.94s -> 6434.34s]  I only saw the truth when they attempted to sentence my son, your uncle, to death.
[6434.98s -> 6438.90s]  It suddenly dawned on me that the only things that mattered were the power I never had,
[6439.54s -> 6441.22s]  and the connections I never cared for.
[6442.02s -> 6446.15s]  You wanted to be righteous while the injustice spread like a plague?
[6446.15s -> 6448.71s]  You should not- you should not be sorry for that.
[6448.71s -> 6450.31s]  Sorry, I misspoke there, dad.
[6450.95s -> 6453.30s]  Now this is my son.
[6453.30s -> 6455.22s]  Who is this- wait, who's the kid?
[6455.22s -> 6455.70s]  Who am I?
[6456.82s -> 6458.02s]  No, that's the kid.
[6458.02s -> 6459.06s]  Where's me?
[6459.06s -> 6460.34s]  Which one of these is me?
[6460.34s -> 6464.87s]  That's me.
[6464.87s -> 6465.59s]  No, that's me.
[6465.59s -> 6472.97s]  Why does my kid look older than me?
[6474.38s -> 6475.98s]  He's dressed like an old man too.
[6475.98s -> 6479.58s]  I am not, but I would rather your brother live so that I still had two sons.
[6479.58s -> 6480.70s]  No, this is dad.
[6491.13s -> 6493.24s]  He looks different in court.
[6493.24s -> 6494.76s]  You have a brother, daddy?
[6494.76s -> 6495.88s]  Where is he?
[6495.88s -> 6502.33s]  He died a long time ago before you were born.
[6502.33s -> 6505.64s]  Why did he die?
[6505.64s -> 6507.80s]  Do not talk so much while eating.
[6510.52s -> 6513.16s]  Your uncle went to war and died in battle.
[6513.24s -> 6517.24s]  Your generation will soon realize the extent of the damage we inflicted upon the world.
[6518.04s -> 6523.26s]  In the past, decent people like Puchard never had to worry about courts or tribunals.
[6523.26s -> 6529.61s]  But now, do you even consider the possibility that Puchard was guilty?
[6529.61s -> 6532.49s]  No, not Mr. Puchard!
[6532.49s -> 6535.86s]  He was no guiltier than any of us, son.
[6535.86s -> 6537.62s]  Keep an eye on the Reynards.
[6537.62s -> 6546.36s]  Jermyn, when you stream games, do you stream with your monitor on or off?
[6548.10s -> 6548.82s]  Typically on.
[6550.18s -> 6559.45s]  I get it.
[6559.45s -> 6560.17s]  Fuck off.
[6560.17s -> 6561.21s]  How does that sound?
[6561.21s -> 6562.09s]  Fuck off, mate.
[6572.38s -> 6573.58s]  Very rare occasion.
[6578.15s -> 6579.11s]  Why did you read that?
[6579.11s -> 6579.59s]  I don't know.
[6580.95s -> 6591.03s]  I'm sorry.
[6591.03s -> 6591.99s]  That was really funny.
[6591.99s -> 6592.95s]  I'll give you that one.
[6592.95s -> 6596.26s]  All right.
[6596.26s -> 6597.86s]  So let's read together.
[6597.86s -> 6599.30s]  It's been a rough couple of days.
[6599.86s -> 6602.86s]  We're going to read together.
[6602.86s -> 6605.61s]  Some people think it's dull.
[6605.61s -> 6606.49s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[6606.49s -> 6607.21s]  Political debate.
[6607.21s -> 6611.00s]  I'm going to bring the sons doing political debate.
[6612.06s -> 6615.82s]  Although, influence on reputation, influence on the people.
[6615.82s -> 6622.01s]  I need dad to be happy.
[6622.01s -> 6622.33s]  What?
[6622.33s -> 6622.73s]  No!
[6622.73s -> 6623.53s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[6623.53s -> 6624.25s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[6625.45s -> 6626.33s]  Oh, come on.
[6626.33s -> 6626.57s]  What?
[6626.57s -> 6627.77s]  They're going to kill me.
[6627.77s -> 6632.18s]  I thought dad wanted to debate politics.
[6632.82s -> 6633.06s]  What?
[6635.91s -> 6636.79s]  Oh, my God.
[6638.10s -> 6638.58s]  All right.
[6638.58s -> 6639.54s]  We've got to kill.
[6639.54s -> 6642.84s]  We're going to have to just drop the guillotine on somebody, I think.
[6643.40s -> 6644.20s]  Oh, this sucks.
[6644.76s -> 6646.62s]  What's my reputation right now?
[6647.34s -> 6648.79s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, this is bad.
[6656.90s -> 6658.10s]  Revolutionaries want to quittle.
[6658.74s -> 6660.18s]  Common people want death penalty.
[6660.98s -> 6662.58s]  I have to pee.
[6663.82s -> 6664.38s]  Give me a minute.
[6664.38s -> 6665.18s]  I'm going to pee.
[6665.18s -> 6666.14s]  I also want to get some water.
[6667.67s -> 6672.87s]  By the way, if you weren't, if you're not aware, I have a cough,
[6672.87s -> 6675.91s]  which if you've been here for even remotely five, 10 minutes, you'd know.
[6675.91s -> 6680.39s]  So I'm trying to keep my vitamin C levels up, stay hydrated.
[6680.39s -> 6681.03s]  I'll be right back.
[6681.75s -> 6875.54s]  Oh, man.
[6875.54s -> 6878.49s]  I drank a glass of water.
[6878.49s -> 6880.41s]  I've just been in a coughing fit this whole time.
[6881.37s -> 6885.96s]  Oh, I was laughing my ass off.
[6886.90s -> 6888.90s]  So remember when we played The Sims modded?
[6890.18s -> 6898.78s]  And I was when the guy was peeing and he was mid piss and he sneezed
[6898.78s -> 6900.46s]  and like his pee stream kept going.
[6900.46s -> 6903.34s]  And somebody said, that's fucking impossible.
[6903.34s -> 6905.50s]  I was like, I don't know why I keep thinking of that.
[6907.96s -> 6911.64s]  I keep seeing that image and seeing that person in chat write that.
[6911.64s -> 6912.92s]  And it makes me laugh every time.
[6913.32s -> 6920.84s]  Because I started coughing while I was peeing and you know what happens?
[6923.24s -> 6928.18s]  The fact that that sim was just mid piss,
[6928.90s -> 6932.34s]  sneezing, coughing, and the stream was just perfect the whole time.
[6938.39s -> 6938.71s]  All right.
[6938.71s -> 6939.51s]  Let's get back to this.
[6942.79s -> 6943.19s]  Sorry.
[6943.19s -> 6943.51s]  Hold on.
[6948.81s -> 6950.79s]  Okay.
[6950.79s -> 6952.07s]  Sekiro's out now.
[6952.07s -> 6953.43s]  Comes out in like a couple hours, doesn't it?
[6958.87s -> 6959.51s]  Anyway, here we go.
[6959.51s -> 6960.39s]  This is murder.
[6961.03s -> 6961.43s]  Murder.
[6963.29s -> 6967.29s]  A tragedy occurred in one of the ten minutes by the...
[6967.29s -> 6968.17s]  Oh my goodness.
[6972.52s -> 6972.76s]  Fuck.
[6973.88s -> 6976.68s]  I picked a great day to do a talking stream, right?
[6979.86s -> 6982.34s]  Like not at every stream is a talking stream, but a reading stream.
[6985.22s -> 6986.82s]  Set your VPN to Japan.
[6986.82s -> 6987.62s]  You can play it now.
[6988.34s -> 6994.79s]  Yeah, but I mean, I can't stream through a VPN.
[6996.71s -> 6998.15s]  I can't stream through a VPN.
[6998.15s -> 6998.55s]  What are you talking about?
[6998.55s -> 6999.27s]  Why would I do that?
[7001.11s -> 7002.15s]  That's fucking illegal.
[7007.10s -> 7007.74s]  All right.
[7007.74s -> 7014.42s]  It's not illegal.
[7014.42s -> 7019.86s]  Yeah, but I'm talking about like pretending that I'm from Japan to stream the game early.
[7021.14s -> 7022.90s]  That's like gotta be illegal.
[7022.90s -> 7024.18s]  You guys would put me in the guillotine.
[7027.58s -> 7029.26s]  Yeah, no, you can't.
[7030.70s -> 7035.74s]  I'm not sure that my internet is powerful enough to be able to stream through a VPN.
[7035.74s -> 7036.54s]  I really don't think so.
[7037.18s -> 7040.04s]  No, we're doing that tomorrow.
[7040.04s -> 7043.40s]  Look, I got to get more vitamin C and drink more water and like go to bed early
[7043.40s -> 7046.04s]  because tomorrow I'm going for like 10 straight hours.
[7046.04s -> 7046.92s]  You heard it here first.
[7047.80s -> 7049.40s]  Put the bulletin on the board.
[7051.32s -> 7055.75s]  No, yeah, we're just hanging up like this.
[7055.75s -> 7057.43s]  I'm good here for a little while longer.
[7058.07s -> 7060.65s]  This is interesting.
[7061.93s -> 7062.65s]  We got a whole...
[7064.09s -> 7066.73s]  Look, because I've been gone for like four days, right?
[7068.12s -> 7071.00s]  I mean, I'm going to play the absolute hell out of Sekiro.
[7071.00s -> 7071.96s]  That's like the...
[7071.96s -> 7073.24s]  I'm not going to stop playing that.
[7074.95s -> 7075.35s]  You know what I mean?
[7075.35s -> 7077.27s]  I'm going to like be eating pizza on stream again.
[7077.91s -> 7081.38s]  But anyways, let's go.
[7081.94s -> 7082.50s]  Ahem.
[7083.78s -> 7087.38s]  A tragedy occurred in one of the tenements by the scene near the point new.
[7088.02s -> 7090.10s]  The fourth floor collapsed.
[7090.98s -> 7091.30s]  Okay.
[7091.94s -> 7097.62s]  The tenants, horrified by the crash and ubiquitous dust, ran outside.
[7097.62s -> 7100.34s]  Only after a few minutes did some of the braver men
[7100.34s -> 7103.22s]  run upstairs to look for survivors and remove the corpses.
[7103.22s -> 7103.62s]  Jesus.
[7104.50s -> 7108.74s]  Rubble and timber buried two families, 12 people.
[7109.22s -> 7111.94s]  Three children managed to survive by hiding beneath a wooden table.
[7112.66s -> 7116.50s]  Neighbors dug them out and carried them to the hotel due.
[7117.90s -> 7120.62s]  We cannot comprehend what the orphans are going through,
[7120.62s -> 7122.78s]  and they have not eaten or spoken for two days.
[7123.50s -> 7123.82s]  Okay.
[7125.24s -> 7129.64s]  The owner of the house testified that he had ordered the construction of an extra floor
[7130.28s -> 7131.32s]  a few years back.
[7132.28s -> 7135.48s]  Works were supervised by architect Maurice Lorty.
[7136.28s -> 7138.52s]  The National Guard found the architect,
[7138.60s -> 7142.44s]  who was also the construction foreman, at an address given by the owner.
[7143.00s -> 7148.68s]  Maurice Lorty was not surprised when the gendarmes knocked at his door,
[7148.68s -> 7151.80s]  and he did not resist when they handcuffed him and took him to jail.
[7155.88s -> 7161.86s]  So this is like criminal negligence, right?
[7166.87s -> 7168.23s]  Construction of an extra floor.
[7169.51s -> 7170.79s]  All right, let's see, there's four questions.
[7170.79s -> 7172.63s]  All right, so we got additional floor.
[7178.54s -> 7181.82s]  So we've got the corpses, that's the victim.
[7182.46s -> 7186.70s]  Collapse floor is the circumstances.
[7186.70s -> 7187.66s]  Oh no.
[7189.38s -> 7192.58s]  Isn't that the, that's like the additional floor
[7192.58s -> 7195.30s]  caused potentially the circumstances of the collapse floor.
[7195.86s -> 7213.72s]  All right, crowded flat.
[7214.90s -> 7216.18s]  That's the circumstance.
[7216.18s -> 7217.54s]  Okay, yeah, I got it, I got it.
[7218.58s -> 7219.38s]  I got it, I got it.
[7220.10s -> 7221.70s]  Get a dictionary, I'm fine.
[7223.43s -> 7226.63s]  Okay, so common folk want death penalty.
[7226.87s -> 7229.03s]  I have to sway towards the death penalty.
[7229.83s -> 7232.07s]  The people, the people are angry and scared
[7232.07s -> 7234.31s]  and expect someone to be punished for this tragedy.
[7236.65s -> 7237.13s]  Your name?
[7238.26s -> 7240.66s]  Maurice Lorty, Mr. Judge.
[7241.38s -> 7242.86s]  Do you build houses?
[7243.66s -> 7244.62s]  That's right.
[7244.62s -> 7247.82s]  I've earned my living from construction and renovation for many years now.
[7248.89s -> 7251.29s]  Did the floor collapse because of your mistake?
[7252.25s -> 7253.13s]  I don't know.
[7253.13s -> 7255.05s]  I have worked at many houses since then.
[7256.06s -> 7258.22s]  There's children are dead because of you.
[7258.86s -> 7261.69s]  Let me just say that I always build the best,
[7261.69s -> 7263.29s]  I always build the best work I can.
[7267.11s -> 7270.23s]  Uh, citizen, a few years ago you were assigned
[7270.23s -> 7271.91s]  to perform some construction work.
[7274.17s -> 7275.77s]  It was nine years ago.
[7275.77s -> 7278.25s]  I was supposed to remove the roof, add one floor,
[7278.25s -> 7279.37s]  then build a new roof.
[7281.64s -> 7282.84s]  Is that a hard task?
[7283.64s -> 7286.34s]  It is known that it is easier to build a new
[7286.34s -> 7288.26s]  than to improve something already there.
[7289.99s -> 7292.47s]  Did the owner have any objections regarding your work?
[7293.82s -> 7296.94s]  If he did, I would have made as many corrections as necessary.
[7298.47s -> 7300.23s]  Which floor was built by you?
[7301.51s -> 7303.03s]  The attic, the fourth.
[7303.03s -> 7305.03s]  Before that, the third floor was the attic.
[7311.77s -> 7312.81s]  Oh, I'm ready.
[7313.70s -> 7314.90s]  They're sharpening the blade.
[7315.54s -> 7322.07s]  Citizen, with your knowledge of construction,
[7322.07s -> 7323.91s]  what could have led to this tragedy?
[7324.47s -> 7328.49s]  I can't be sure.
[7328.49s -> 7332.17s]  Pests, poor materials, too much load on the structure.
[7332.17s -> 7333.77s]  Every house is different.
[7333.77s -> 7334.89s]  This should have been checked
[7334.89s -> 7336.73s]  before the room fell on people's heads.
[7338.04s -> 7340.04s]  You did not mention a construction error.
[7341.16s -> 7343.16s]  Yes, unfortunately, that could also happen.
[7343.16s -> 7344.36s]  I could have made a mistake
[7344.36s -> 7346.68s]  and my calculations are wrongly assessed
[7346.68s -> 7347.96s]  the quality of the timber.
[7349.37s -> 7350.49s]  You are not denying it.
[7351.13s -> 7353.21s]  If you judge that I have contributed
[7353.21s -> 7354.33s]  to the death of those children,
[7354.33s -> 7356.25s]  I will accept whatever punishment you choose.
[7356.89s -> 7359.61s]  Two weeks ago, a disease took my wife
[7359.61s -> 7361.53s]  and I no longer care what happens to me.
[7362.89s -> 7363.77s]  Oh, fuck.
[7375.24s -> 7376.44s]  Did you talk to the tenants,
[7376.44s -> 7378.44s]  the ones that pulled the victims from the rubble?
[7380.87s -> 7382.87s]  They came to me in the night angry and hurt.
[7382.87s -> 7384.55s]  I understand their pain is too...
[7384.55s -> 7385.51s]  I too have children.
[7386.15s -> 7387.03s]  Answer my question.
[7387.03s -> 7387.91s]  Did you talk to them?
[7388.86s -> 7390.54s]  No, I was forced to hide inside my house
[7390.54s -> 7391.58s]  and close the window shutters
[7391.58s -> 7392.94s]  because they were throwing stones.
[7393.66s -> 7396.46s]  So the building collapsed because of your mistake
[7396.46s -> 7397.82s]  and you did not even have the courage
[7397.82s -> 7399.26s]  to talk to the victims?
[7400.14s -> 7401.26s]  I'm a coward, I know.
[7402.57s -> 7403.85s]  How did they know where to go?
[7404.87s -> 7405.75s]  I don't know.
[7405.75s -> 7408.23s]  Only the owner of the tenement knew my address.
[7410.58s -> 7412.10s]  Oh, fuck, we're about to prove...
[7412.10s -> 7414.02s]  We're about to call in the witness and like prove...
[7428.86s -> 7438.55s]  All right, but the thing is,
[7439.83s -> 7440.71s]  how long in prison?
[7440.71s -> 7442.71s]  Can I say like just like a little while?
[7447.62s -> 7449.14s]  If this drops, I die.
[7453.69s -> 7455.05s]  Prison's the most...
[7455.05s -> 7457.61s]  Okay, I'm going to do prison just because it's...
[7459.77s -> 7461.37s]  I'm corrupt as hell,
[7461.37s -> 7463.21s]  but you have to understand something.
[7463.21s -> 7464.01s]  They're going to come after me.
[7464.65s -> 7470.31s]  Did the defendant confess to the crimes?
[7470.31s -> 7471.59s]  Yeah, kind of.
[7472.15s -> 7474.18s]  Does he act counter-revolutionary?
[7474.18s -> 7474.68s]  No.
[7476.90s -> 7477.62s]  Call the witness?
[7477.62s -> 7478.74s]  Yeah, but if the witness...
[7480.26s -> 7482.82s]  If the witness comes in and says a bunch of shit,
[7483.54s -> 7486.50s]  then the people might not be so inclined.
[7488.30s -> 7490.46s]  Are you the owner of the house where the floor collapsed?
[7491.80s -> 7492.36s]  Yes.
[7492.36s -> 7493.88s]  The floor and the attic collapsed
[7493.88s -> 7495.32s]  and fell on the rooms beneath.
[7497.72s -> 7499.96s]  Did the tenants complain about anything prior to the tragedy?
[7500.52s -> 7502.89s]  The apartments were small, correct?
[7507.48s -> 7510.95s]  Did the tenants complain about anything prior to the tragedy?
[7511.75s -> 7513.51s]  They said something about squeaky floors,
[7513.51s -> 7516.31s]  but that's not unusual as they squeak at my place too.
[7516.31s -> 7516.81s]  So what?
[7517.43s -> 7519.32s]  Did you inspect the floors?
[7520.22s -> 7521.34s]  I planned to,
[7521.34s -> 7523.58s]  but this tragedy happened before I was able to.
[7524.81s -> 7526.65s]  Thank God he managed to take their money.
[7532.42s -> 7534.82s]  So no, so he didn't.
[7539.80s -> 7550.31s]  According to the witness,
[7550.31s -> 7552.71s]  did the tenants complain about anything, squeaky floors?
[7559.02s -> 7563.77s]  All right, prison, death penalty.
[7563.77s -> 7565.69s]  Prison is probably the best choice
[7565.69s -> 7566.89s]  because he might not have...
[7570.42s -> 7571.94s]  Kill him for the love of God,
[7571.94s -> 7573.94s]  but my conscience is at stake here.
[7575.59s -> 7577.27s]  Squeaky kill is the best,
[7578.07s -> 7586.38s]  but kill him because he mad at squeaky floors?
[7587.10s -> 7587.60s]  Really?
[7595.99s -> 7613.58s]  He just said something fucking horrible.
[7613.58s -> 7615.66s]  Architect Lordy shall be sent to the guillotine
[7615.66s -> 7618.06s]  for the terrible tragic death of two families.
[7618.06s -> 7619.34s]  Long live justice!
[7622.76s -> 7623.64s]  Incorrect.
[7623.64s -> 7625.78s]  And I did a good job.
[7625.78s -> 7626.66s]  Okay, here we go.
[7627.46s -> 7631.46s]  I got some common folk reputation.
[7632.78s -> 7634.14s]  Let's try to make...
[7634.14s -> 7635.02s]  Let's do the speech.
[7636.62s -> 7637.50s]  Take a breather.
[7637.50s -> 7638.78s]  No, I have a cough.
[7640.71s -> 7642.79s]  It's been annoying the last two days.
[7643.75s -> 7645.11s]  Maybe I could win the heart of the crowd.
[7647.56s -> 7648.36s]  They're irritated.
[7650.31s -> 7650.71s]  Skip...
[7650.71s -> 7651.91s]  Speak to the common folk.
[7653.82s -> 7655.88s]  Okay, so the crime...
[7656.68s -> 7657.72s]  Carelessness.
[7657.72s -> 7659.40s]  I would say carelessness, right?
[7662.23s -> 7664.47s]  So they're bullheaded right now.
[7666.02s -> 7666.58s]  Aggression.
[7669.00s -> 7669.64s]  The defendant...
[7670.36s -> 7671.40s]  Let's reveal this.
[7671.40s -> 7672.12s]  This is attached.
[7672.12s -> 7672.84s]  Let's manipulate.
[7675.86s -> 7677.54s]  Manipulate and then bullheaded.
[7677.54s -> 7679.62s]  We can do either aggression or humility.
[7679.62s -> 7680.26s]  Aggression, right?
[7681.06s -> 7684.31s]  And the crime would be carelessness.
[7685.96s -> 7686.44s]  So that's...
[7693.62s -> 7694.34s]  I think that's good.
[7701.88s -> 7703.32s]  Carelessness is the approach.
[7705.62s -> 7707.06s]  Well, isn't that the crime?
[7708.02s -> 7712.31s]  Let's just see.
[7712.31s -> 7712.87s]  Attached.
[7712.87s -> 7715.19s]  Well, manipulation again.
[7716.63s -> 7719.11s]  Manipulation, manipulation, and then aggression.
[7719.83s -> 7731.10s]  That makes sense.
[7731.82s -> 7737.53s]  There we go.
[7737.53s -> 7738.33s]  Yeah, I was right.
[7739.21s -> 7739.77s]  That one would...
[7739.77s -> 7740.73s]  This one was strong.
[7740.73s -> 7741.61s]  This one would have been okay.
[7742.49s -> 7743.45s]  So now we're going to do...
[7743.45s -> 7745.85s]  So it's manipulation, manipulation, aggression.
[7746.94s -> 7747.42s]  Let's go.
[7750.07s -> 7750.95s]  Manipulation.
[7752.55s -> 7755.67s]  Future generations will remember that we were not cowards.
[7756.31s -> 7759.67s]  They will remember us delivering punishment for such heinous crimes.
[7760.31s -> 7761.67s]  All right?
[7761.67s -> 7762.95s]  Defendant, manipulate.
[7763.51s -> 7767.61s]  Will you just stand there and allow criminals to tell you what to do?
[7768.33s -> 7770.84s]  And then aggression.
[7771.56s -> 7773.90s]  You have gained power in France.
[7773.90s -> 7776.38s]  Now spill the blood of those who oppose the Republic.
[7778.23s -> 7779.03s]  Oh, come on.
[7779.75s -> 7781.61s]  Oh, come on.
[7781.61s -> 7781.85s]  What?
[7782.65s -> 7788.92s]  That was perfect.
[7788.92s -> 7790.52s]  That was strong, perfect, perfect.
[7796.79s -> 7797.83s]  Is this justice?
[7797.83s -> 7799.99s]  Will someone punish the owner of the house?
[7805.03s -> 7810.39s]  Do I have to do it?
[7810.39s -> 7811.35s]  Can somebody else do it?
[7811.99s -> 7823.06s]  What's that famous line?
[7823.78s -> 7826.06s]  The one that carries out a sentence.
[7826.78s -> 7828.94s]  Should carry out a sword, right?
[7832.90s -> 7834.18s]  He's ours.
[7834.18s -> 7836.44s]  Uh-oh.
[7836.44s -> 7838.73s]  Uh.
[7838.73s -> 7843.21s]  There can be no more demeaning experience for revolutionary Paris
[7843.21s -> 7845.69s]  than the escape of Citizen Capet.
[7845.69s -> 7848.73s]  He escaped, slipped right from their hands,
[7848.73s -> 7851.53s]  and the revolution now seems feeble and weak.
[7851.53s -> 7855.53s]  The people resemble a child that could easily be duped by anyone.
[7856.25s -> 7858.89s]  However, the Republic quickly composed itself
[7858.89s -> 7860.89s]  thanks to a postmaster and his people
[7860.89s -> 7864.33s]  who were able to catch the fugitives escaping to Montmidi.
[7864.33s -> 7867.93s]  Ordinary citizens led to the fall of a monarch.
[7867.93s -> 7870.41s]  You will have a chance to serve the Republic as well,
[7870.41s -> 7873.93s]  for Citizen Capet will face the tribunal tomorrow.
[7873.93s -> 7876.25s]  You will choose how he will be remembered
[7876.25s -> 7880.17s]  as a traitor and a coward or as an unlucky statesman.
[7881.22s -> 7884.42s]  If it were for the prison guards to decide,
[7884.42s -> 7886.34s]  there would be only one outcome.
[7891.13s -> 7893.67s]  Allow the guards to rough up Citizen Capet
[7893.67s -> 7895.27s]  or leave him alone until the trial.
[7895.91s -> 7897.98s]  Does this get me points with people?
[7912.06s -> 7913.02s]  I'll get points with the people.
[7914.58s -> 7915.54s]  I need those right now.
[7922.06s -> 7924.30s]  Or the fair trial.
[7924.30s -> 7936.02s]  Let's have trial.
[7936.82s -> 7940.81s]  Get him out of here.
[7940.81s -> 7941.93s]  Work on tomorrow's trial.
[7942.57s -> 7943.61s]  Opening that at the theater.
[7944.33s -> 7947.77s]  Let's go to the theater.
[7949.24s -> 7950.36s]  Fuck, am I getting worse?
[7950.36s -> 7951.08s]  I might be.
[7951.08s -> 7951.72s]  This is bad.
[7952.44s -> 7956.98s]  I didn't feel this coffee earlier before it started.
[7957.62s -> 7959.80s]  Work on tomorrow's trial.
[7959.80s -> 7960.44s]  I think I've...
[7960.44s -> 7964.55s]  No, I have to get this up.
[7964.55s -> 7966.36s]  Evening with granddad.
[7966.36s -> 7968.44s]  Sit down with your father and listen to stories of days.
[7968.44s -> 7970.12s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[7974.54s -> 7976.22s]  Where we can lose some of that.
[7976.22s -> 7978.74s]  You can lose some of the sun, that's fine.
[7978.74s -> 7989.53s]  Listen to grandpa ramble.
[7994.01s -> 7994.81s]  There he is.
[7996.44s -> 7997.00s]  The king.
[8001.93s -> 8004.65s]  The people want death penalty.
[8004.65s -> 8006.41s]  The revolutionaries want death penalty.
[8006.41s -> 8009.29s]  The family wants prison and nobody wants acquittal.
[8013.11s -> 8013.61s]  Okay.
[8016.73s -> 8020.01s]  My lord, should any reason appear,
[8020.01s -> 8021.77s]  shoot the rebels without hesitation.
[8022.33s -> 8023.93s]  Just as his majesty ordered,
[8023.93s -> 8026.81s]  have no mercy for they shall have none either.
[8027.98s -> 8029.18s]  VF Bugleberry.
[8029.82s -> 8040.44s]  Counterrevolution, treason, fraud,
[8040.44s -> 8042.76s]  advocating monarchy and neglect of duty.
[8046.06s -> 8047.50s]  What's in here?
[8051.00s -> 8051.56s]  Victory.
[8054.20s -> 8057.08s]  Okay, minus four reputation.
[8057.88s -> 8059.93s]  Plus one revolutionary endorsement.
[8063.91s -> 8066.38s]  My reputation is so bad.
[8067.18s -> 8069.94s]  Any more notifications?
[8071.66s -> 8072.06s]  All right.
[8073.53s -> 8076.73s]  Louis Capet, I hereby open your trial.
[8076.73s -> 8078.65s]  Answer the questions when you are asked.
[8082.94s -> 8085.02s]  Capet is the name of one of my ancestors.
[8085.02s -> 8087.02s]  My name is Louis August de Bourbeau.
[8089.37s -> 8091.85s]  That may have been your name before you raised your hand
[8091.85s -> 8093.77s]  against the people you had sworn to defend.
[8095.05s -> 8097.61s]  As a king, I have never done a thing against my people.
[8097.61s -> 8099.21s]  I love them and I still do.
[8100.90s -> 8101.54s]  Objection!
[8101.54s -> 8102.74s]  Ah, that hurt my throat.
[8112.30s -> 8113.94s]  I'm just gonna say the word.
[8113.94s -> 8114.66s]  Objection!
[8115.22s -> 8117.78s]  There's evidence of Louis Capet's treason
[8117.78s -> 8119.30s]  against the people of France.
[8119.30s -> 8121.62s]  He should be tried as a foreigner and an enemy,
[8121.62s -> 8122.90s]  not a citizen of the Republic.
[8123.62s -> 8126.12s]  This is the audience.
[8126.12s -> 8128.44s]  Questioning the defendant will stir the impatient audience.
[8128.44s -> 8131.08s]  Once angered, the people may even start a riot.
[8133.18s -> 8135.10s]  I can't do voices.
[8135.10s -> 8137.34s]  Drink some tea, I got something right here already.
[8137.34s -> 8137.84s]  See?
[8138.54s -> 8139.34s]  It's a brick.
[8139.34s -> 8140.94s]  I'm just like licking it with salt.
[8143.54s -> 8144.02s]  Let's read.
[8148.66s -> 8152.42s]  Compatriot Citizen Capet, previously known as King Louis,
[8153.30s -> 8156.34s]  the ex-V.I. of France,
[8158.65s -> 8161.53s]  must be punished for conspiring against the people of France.
[8162.65s -> 8166.89s]  Louis Capet tried to defend his absolute authority
[8166.89s -> 8170.49s]  by plotting against the National Constituent Assembly
[8170.49s -> 8171.53s]  and the people of France.
[8172.57s -> 8174.73s]  We all remember July of 1789,
[8174.73s -> 8178.25s]  he gathered an army, fifteen foreign regiments,
[8178.25s -> 8180.49s]  and ordered them to surround Paris.
[8181.29s -> 8183.53s]  Soldiers led by Baron de Bessignolles
[8184.09s -> 8186.73s]  were to capture deputies and shoot at citizens
[8186.73s -> 8188.41s]  defending the reforms.
[8188.41s -> 8189.61s]  And so they did.
[8189.61s -> 8192.17s]  The Royal German Regiment drew first blood.
[8193.45s -> 8197.05s]  After the plot failed, Louis tried to flee the country
[8197.61s -> 8201.05s]  with his family and scheme with foreign monarchs abroad.
[8201.77s -> 8205.53s]  Is that not the reason he took flight from the Tuileries
[8205.53s -> 8209.13s]  one night in June of 1791 using someone else's passport?
[8209.77s -> 8212.49s]  Was he not heading to Montmedie
[8212.49s -> 8214.17s]  where his loyal armies were stationed
[8214.17s -> 8215.61s]  ready to take him to Austria?
[8216.41s -> 8218.33s]  If it were not for Postmaster Dore,
[8219.66s -> 8221.82s]  the scheme could have ended tragically for us.
[8222.70s -> 8224.74s]  Louis Capet will never abandon the thought
[8224.74s -> 8226.58s]  of suppressing the revolution by force.
[8227.22s -> 8230.02s]  Before the events of 1792, he gave orders
[8230.02s -> 8233.14s]  for the Swiss Guard stationed in the Tuileries to be doubled.
[8233.86s -> 8237.14s]  He conducted a public muster in front of horrified citizens.
[8237.78s -> 8238.82s]  The people had no choice.
[8239.54s -> 8241.94s]  They had to act before Capet attacked
[8241.94s -> 8244.18s]  citizens of Paris who tried to stop the madness
[8244.18s -> 8246.74s]  was shot at, even after Capet's escape
[8246.74s -> 8247.94s]  to the National Assembly.
[8248.90s -> 8251.62s]  And evidence in order issued by Marshal de Broglie
[8251.62s -> 8252.98s]  to Baron de Bessignolles.
[8253.94s -> 8257.67s]  Oh, god damn it.
[8258.63s -> 8261.26s]  I'm starting to turn into dust.
[8262.90s -> 8263.30s]  All right.
[8263.30s -> 8266.39s]  So, hey, we got anything else?
[8267.27s -> 8273.42s]  Equitable.
[8275.50s -> 8276.62s]  If I equate them, I'm dead.
[8277.50s -> 8283.06s]  If I press this button, then that's it for me.
[8283.06s -> 8284.50s]  I'm going to, they're going to throw
[8284.50s -> 8285.78s]  like a fucking spear at me.
[8286.58s -> 8290.79s]  So let's, let's start the questions by,
[8290.79s -> 8293.35s]  and by that, I mean, let's take a look what we've got.
[8294.07s -> 8296.55s]  Oh, there's a lot.
[8296.55s -> 8297.99s]  Ten questions to reveal.
[8298.79s -> 8300.07s]  Surrounding, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8300.07s -> 8301.83s]  Suppress the revolution is an accusation.
[8302.39s -> 8304.15s]  Doubling the size of the guard method
[8304.15s -> 8306.39s]  shooting civilians accusation.
[8307.75s -> 8308.07s]  Okay.
[8308.07s -> 8309.27s]  Defending his authority.
[8309.27s -> 8310.47s]  Gathering armed forces.
[8311.43s -> 8315.90s]  The attempt to flee the country is,
[8315.90s -> 8318.14s]  that's a, that's a motive.
[8318.14s -> 8319.26s]  Fake passport is evidence.
[8323.03s -> 8323.75s]  No evidence there?
[8332.76s -> 8333.48s]  Shit.
[8333.48s -> 8334.44s]  I was just going to kill him.
[8335.24s -> 8336.12s]  Fake passport.
[8336.84s -> 8337.16s]  Okay.
[8337.96s -> 8340.60s]  International plot is motive.
[8342.34s -> 8343.46s]  How is that?
[8343.46s -> 8346.58s]  How is the proportional plot not the motive?
[8346.58s -> 8348.18s]  Isn't that like the plot?
[8349.54s -> 8356.95s]  Suppressing the revolution is the motive.
[8361.40s -> 8364.04s]  International plot, you're accused.
[8364.04s -> 8365.96s]  Suppressing the revolution is the motive.
[8367.19s -> 8367.83s]  Is the method.
[8368.47s -> 8372.10s]  No, that's what it is.
[8372.90s -> 8373.22s]  Okay.
[8376.82s -> 8377.30s]  Witness.
[8377.30s -> 8379.14s]  Postmaster DeRay was a witness.
[8380.82s -> 8382.10s]  Gathering the armed forces.
[8382.10s -> 8382.82s]  That's a method.
[8383.98s -> 8385.42s]  Surrounding the city of Paris.
[8385.42s -> 8387.02s]  That is an accusation.
[8387.02s -> 8391.77s]  Suppressing the revolution.
[8391.77s -> 8393.61s]  Doubling the size of the guard is also a,
[8393.61s -> 8394.81s]  they're a method or an accusation.
[8397.64s -> 8403.64s]  That's also a method.
[8404.20s -> 8405.08s]  What's the third question?
[8405.08s -> 8405.88s]  There could be two here?
[8406.52s -> 8412.66s]  This isn't a game.
[8412.66s -> 8413.54s]  This is homework.
[8415.14s -> 8417.83s]  All right.
[8417.83s -> 8422.46s]  So this is making me feel tense.
[8422.46s -> 8423.66s]  This is making, I'm going to sneeze.
[8424.30s -> 8426.06s]  I'm trying to figure out how to do that
[8426.06s -> 8428.86s]  without being annoying on stream.
[8429.66s -> 8434.04s]  Somebody just gave 100 bucks too.
[8435.74s -> 8438.94s]  Cora Monster gave $100, 10,000 bits.
[8438.94s -> 8439.58s]  Thank you so much.
[8441.75s -> 8443.83s]  100 large bits.
[8446.38s -> 8447.82s]  Hey, Jerma, I got accepted to the
[8447.82s -> 8450.14s]  studio arts program at a college I applied to.
[8450.78s -> 8452.06s]  Well, that's awesome.
[8452.62s -> 8453.98s]  First of all, congratulations to that.
[8454.62s -> 8455.90s]  Your own brand of creativity
[8455.90s -> 8457.50s]  has been really inspiring for me.
[8457.50s -> 8459.02s]  And your Discord channel has given me
[8459.02s -> 8460.70s]  a great outlet to share the stuff I draw.
[8461.42s -> 8462.70s]  Your streams have been very helpful
[8462.70s -> 8464.06s]  in de-stressing during the time
[8464.06s -> 8465.58s]  I was getting ready to apply.
[8465.58s -> 8467.58s]  And I'm very thankful for your streams.
[8468.14s -> 8469.26s]  I say, Jerma, one guy.
[8470.14s -> 8472.81s]  That's fucking incredible.
[8474.34s -> 8475.78s]  I'm so happy that you got accepted.
[8476.50s -> 8478.95s]  It's a great feeling.
[8480.41s -> 8481.13s]  Do good work.
[8482.39s -> 8483.11s]  Stay focused.
[8483.75s -> 8485.62s]  Have a good time.
[8485.62s -> 8489.30s]  Glad you can hang out here and de-stress.
[8489.30s -> 8493.14s]  And thank you for the $100.
[8494.42s -> 8496.25s]  That is an absolute shitload of money.
[8500.28s -> 8500.76s]  All right.
[8500.76s -> 8507.66s]  So on top of we're going forward here, art.
[8507.66s -> 8508.14s]  Yeah, art.
[8508.14s -> 8510.52s]  No, that's there are a lot of
[8510.52s -> 8512.36s]  talented fucking artists that are here.
[8512.36s -> 8513.16s]  I've said it before.
[8514.12s -> 8518.74s]  Streamers stealing money from poor art students.
[8520.04s -> 8523.34s]  Buy some pencils and some paintbrushes,
[8523.34s -> 8525.50s]  some crayons and some pastels
[8528.50s -> 8529.78s]  and some textbooks.
[8529.78s -> 8531.54s]  Suppressing the revolution is a method,
[8531.54s -> 8532.98s]  is a motive, it's an accusation.
[8534.18s -> 8535.94s]  Doubling the size of the guard is a method.
[8537.02s -> 8539.34s]  Suppressing the revolution is a motive.
[8544.07s -> 8544.87s]  It's an accusation.
[8546.60s -> 8547.80s]  I'm getting fucking worse.
[8548.92s -> 8549.24s]  Shit.
[8549.24s -> 8550.44s]  Am I really going to have to like
[8550.44s -> 8551.88s]  cut this stream short?
[8555.18s -> 8555.82s]  God damn it.
[8560.36s -> 8563.40s]  Does the itchy, you have to cough now
[8564.04s -> 8565.16s]  is happening more often.
[8566.12s -> 8566.76s]  All right, we're good.
[8567.32s -> 8569.67s]  I missed one.
[8572.04s -> 8573.00s]  That's a motive.
[8573.00s -> 8574.04s]  I told you it was a motive.
[8574.04s -> 8575.16s]  Everybody said that I was wrong.
[8576.70s -> 8577.02s]  All right.
[8577.02s -> 8577.82s]  Who issued the...
[8577.82s -> 8579.10s]  Let's go right off the bat.
[8579.10s -> 8580.14s]  Top questions.
[8580.14s -> 8581.50s]  You're on my show.
[8581.50s -> 8583.66s]  Who issued the order to fire at the citizens?
[8586.01s -> 8589.61s]  Either Marshal de Broglie or Baron de Bissenbaum.
[8589.61s -> 8591.85s]  The one responsible should be the one standing here
[8591.85s -> 8594.73s]  as he was not authorized to issue such orders.
[8595.96s -> 8596.84s]  Really?
[8596.84s -> 8598.12s]  Not according to this document
[8598.12s -> 8599.64s]  it was signed by the Marshal.
[8600.68s -> 8604.28s]  Marshal de Broglie went too far and lied to us all.
[8604.28s -> 8607.08s]  I swear on my crown I did not issue that order.
[8608.78s -> 8610.78s]  De Broglie is a sworn monarchist
[8610.78s -> 8613.42s]  and was given an army to suppress the revolution.
[8613.42s -> 8615.74s]  Would he work on his own without Capet's blessing?
[8616.84s -> 8619.48s]  People sometimes do stupid things.
[8627.66s -> 8629.42s]  Has the accused ever considered Paris
[8629.42s -> 8631.02s]  and its citizens to be his enemies?
[8631.74s -> 8636.25s]  Absolutely not.
[8636.25s -> 8638.01s]  I asked that you explain the question.
[8639.29s -> 8643.93s]  How can you deny it if you do not understand the question?
[8643.93s -> 8645.85s]  Your army surrounded Paris.
[8645.85s -> 8647.85s]  Is that not what you do to your enemies?
[8650.60s -> 8653.64s]  My soldiers were there only to ensure public order
[8653.64s -> 8655.56s]  while the National Assembly was in session.
[8657.19s -> 8659.99s]  Adequate forces were already present in Paris.
[8659.99s -> 8660.79s]  Was that not enough?
[8664.63s -> 8670.90s]  Who helped you suppress the revolution?
[8670.90s -> 8674.01s]  Frederick William II?
[8674.01s -> 8674.89s]  Francis II?
[8674.89s -> 8675.61s]  Catherine II?
[8676.17s -> 8679.21s]  Or maybe it was somebody that wasn't a two in their name.
[8679.21s -> 8682.33s]  Maybe it was the guy with the three or the four.
[8683.22s -> 8684.50s]  Charlie IV, huh?
[8684.50s -> 8685.14s]  Was it four?
[8686.34s -> 8687.70s]  Justice awaits them as well.
[8689.13s -> 8690.41s]  Nonsense all of it.
[8690.41s -> 8693.05s]  I only desire to take my family out of Paris
[8693.05s -> 8695.53s]  as I did not wish for them to suffer house arrest.
[8696.78s -> 8698.54s]  We all know the European monarchs
[8698.54s -> 8702.22s]  despise our ideals of freedom, equality, and brotherhood.
[8702.78s -> 8705.02s]  Am I to understand that you try to prepare
[8705.02s -> 8707.02s]  a joint military intervention?
[8708.04s -> 8709.88s]  I deny any such accusation.
[8709.88s -> 8712.52s]  There is no evidence for such outrageous claims.
[8712.52s -> 8714.52s]  I would never turn against my beloved France.
[8717.67s -> 8718.31s]  Liar!
[8718.31s -> 8718.95s]  Oh, that hurt.
[8720.87s -> 8722.71s]  I can only go so loud before it hurts.
[8723.51s -> 8725.75s]  He'd sell his own mother, never mind his country.
[8727.56s -> 8728.84s]  Wait, people want me to quit them?
[8729.64s -> 8730.76s]  How does that make any sense?
[8734.74s -> 8735.46s]  That's, no.
[8735.46s -> 8736.66s]  The people are getting aggressive.
[8736.66s -> 8737.78s]  How do I calm them down?
[8739.43s -> 8740.71s]  How do I calm them down?
[8743.56s -> 8744.52s]  People are aggressive.
[8744.52s -> 8746.20s]  What do I, is it, what am I, like, book?
[8751.32s -> 8753.16s]  Do I have any way to calm them down?
[8753.96s -> 8757.03s]  Let's relax.
[8757.03s -> 8757.91s]  Let's go to an easy,
[8757.91s -> 8759.91s]  let's go to like a softball question here.
[8761.67s -> 8765.51s]  Was he accused planning to reclaim his authority in Paris
[8765.51s -> 8767.51s]  and reestablish an absolute monarchy?
[8767.51s -> 8769.67s]  Well, that's actually very inflammatory.
[8769.67s -> 8771.27s]  That's, that's very inflammatory.
[8771.27s -> 8772.15s]  Why would I do that?
[8772.15s -> 8773.67s]  According to the constitution,
[8773.67s -> 8775.91s]  I always, yeah, this is very, very, very bad.
[8778.39s -> 8779.35s]  Pick red, no.
[8780.15s -> 8781.75s]  They're gonna fucking freak out.
[8782.92s -> 8784.04s]  I am still the king.
[8785.34s -> 8787.82s]  Then why did you raise a number of troops in the Tuileries?
[8790.46s -> 8792.06s]  I feared for my family's life.
[8792.06s -> 8794.54s]  It is not a mystery that the citizens of Paris
[8794.54s -> 8797.58s]  were incited to seize the palace and capture us,
[8797.58s -> 8799.66s]  especially as it was Mr. Danton's goal.
[8800.62s -> 8804.42s]  Ah, it is clear then that the guard
[8804.42s -> 8806.82s]  were organized against the citizens of Paris,
[8806.82s -> 8808.98s]  many of whom did fall in the Tuileries.
[8810.10s -> 8812.02s]  Against violence and disorder?
[8812.02s -> 8814.02s]  Mr. Tinville, not against my people.
[8814.82s -> 8819.46s]  Who is responsible for the delivery
[8819.46s -> 8821.78s]  of the passport of the man called Pinet?
[8827.61s -> 8828.25s]  My butler.
[8828.25s -> 8830.09s]  I ordered him to prepare all the formalities
[8830.09s -> 8831.45s]  regarding travel to Montmedy.
[8833.82s -> 8835.10s]  The city hall has not received
[8835.10s -> 8838.14s]  any submissions from your butler.
[8838.14s -> 8839.58s]  I do not know what to say.
[8841.54s -> 8844.34s]  Mr. Judge, Louis Carpets' butler
[8844.34s -> 8846.50s]  was seen at the Austrian embassy.
[8846.50s -> 8847.94s]  They sure took care of all the documents
[8847.94s -> 8848.74s]  for the defectors.
[8850.57s -> 8852.41s]  What's your Tinville that there's mere hearsay?
[8852.89s -> 8854.09s]  Who said such a thing?
[8854.09s -> 8856.09s]  Bring him here so that I may repeat it.
[8857.72s -> 8858.52s]  There's no need.
[8858.52s -> 8859.64s]  That is hard evidence,
[8859.64s -> 8861.72s]  especially in light of what the accused has told us.
[8869.30s -> 8870.58s]  What did the accused plan to do
[8870.58s -> 8872.34s]  with the constituents' deputies?
[8872.90s -> 8876.31s]  Well, we're getting close to a riot.
[8878.04s -> 8878.92s]  Nothing.
[8878.92s -> 8882.12s]  The assembly that I joined on the 27th June 1789
[8882.12s -> 8884.12s]  granted immunity to its members,
[8884.12s -> 8885.88s]  and I intended to respect that.
[8887.03s -> 8888.63s]  And yet you ordered your soldiers
[8888.63s -> 8891.27s]  to seize and imprison the deputies,
[8891.27s -> 8892.79s]  and perhaps even execute them.
[8894.18s -> 8894.74s]  Nonsense.
[8895.54s -> 8897.22s]  There's no evidence of that.
[8897.22s -> 8899.46s]  My enemies spread rumors to get rid of me.
[8900.18s -> 8902.01s]  We don't need evidence
[8902.01s -> 8904.17s]  against a coward who runs from his own people.
[8904.17s -> 8905.61s]  That person was waiting to say that
[8905.61s -> 8907.61s]  for like fucking 40 straight minutes.
[8907.61s -> 8909.21s]  They were practicing over and over again.
[8909.21s -> 8910.41s]  They were practicing it in the head,
[8910.97s -> 8912.25s]  and they finally had an opportunity
[8912.25s -> 8913.05s]  to drop out and say it.
[8913.69s -> 8917.35s]  All right, we're getting the imprisonment.
[8917.91s -> 8920.15s]  Call on the witness Jean Doré.
[8920.87s -> 8929.16s]  Okay, introduce yourself.
[8930.47s -> 8933.35s]  Jean Doré, postmaster of Saint-Main-Haut,
[8933.35s -> 8934.23s]  Monsieur Les Jouges.
[8936.39s -> 8937.35s]  Bad judge.
[8937.35s -> 8937.85s]  What?
[8941.37s -> 8942.01s]  What did I do?
[8945.29s -> 8948.15s]  Did the accused Louis Capet
[8948.15s -> 8949.43s]  introduce himself to the witness
[8949.43s -> 8950.47s]  with his full name?
[8952.58s -> 8954.66s]  No, he didn't introduce himself at all.
[8954.66s -> 8956.74s]  They only produced someone else's documents.
[8958.06s -> 8959.74s]  So he tried to hide his identity.
[8960.38s -> 8961.66s]  You could say so.
[8961.66s -> 8963.26s]  I used the name from the documents
[8963.26s -> 8964.70s]  after he showed them to me.
[8964.70s -> 8965.66s]  He never objected.
[8966.87s -> 8968.47s]  Then how did you learn his true identity?
[8969.80s -> 8973.24s]  By the image of the paper assignation.
[8975.72s -> 8977.88s]  Then a messenger from General Lafayette
[8977.88s -> 8979.16s]  confirmed my suspicions.
[8979.72s -> 8981.48s]  I ran as fast as I could to Varennes
[8981.48s -> 8982.60s]  to inform the authorities.
[8984.84s -> 8985.96s]  The accused tell anyone
[8985.96s -> 8987.40s]  the destination of his journey.
[8989.13s -> 8990.17s]  Acting like a defector,
[8990.17s -> 8991.53s]  was he nervous or in a hurry?
[8997.94s -> 9001.62s]  I say, I say, foghorn, leghorn.
[9010.79s -> 9011.59s]  That was pretty good.
[9014.86s -> 9016.70s]  There's a lot of French names
[9016.70s -> 9018.22s]  and it's hard to pronounce French names.
[9018.22s -> 9019.18s]  I don't speak French.
[9019.74s -> 9022.14s]  I didn't even take French 101 in high school.
[9031.86s -> 9034.42s]  I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say the top one.
[9040.66s -> 9042.66s]  Does anybody hear the end stream song?
[9049.45s -> 9050.73s]  Did he tell you the destination?
[9051.45s -> 9053.77s]  He asked for the way to Montmidi.
[9053.77s -> 9056.57s]  I told him to go through Varennes and Argonne
[9056.57s -> 9058.65s]  and warned the coachman to be careful.
[9058.65s -> 9060.41s]  The road is difficult out there.
[9061.21s -> 9064.86s]  Would the accused like to comment
[9064.86s -> 9065.82s]  on this testimony?
[9066.54s -> 9068.54s]  It confirms that I had no intention of escaping.
[9068.54s -> 9069.50s]  I was merely traveling
[9069.50s -> 9071.42s]  and is the right of any free citizen.
[9090.33s -> 9091.21s]  Bad judge.
[9093.10s -> 9094.62s]  People's patience has its limits.
[9094.62s -> 9096.22s]  The trial went on for too long
[9096.22s -> 9099.42s]  and the audience was extremely agitated.
[9102.04s -> 9103.40s]  Okay, fine.
[9103.40s -> 9104.52s]  Put an ax in his head.
[9105.32s -> 9106.52s]  What happened in real life?
[9107.08s -> 9109.22s]  Because we could just cheat, right?
[9109.22s -> 9110.90s]  By using actual history.
[9110.90s -> 9114.34s]  King Louis the...
[9114.34s -> 9115.38s]  What happened to him?
[9115.46s -> 9122.63s]  He got the guillotine.
[9122.63s -> 9135.21s]  Okay, imagine if I just changed the history
[9135.21s -> 9135.77s]  and put him...
[9136.87s -> 9138.15s]  He's still alive.
[9142.38s -> 9144.38s]  Oh god, that's so stupid.
[9144.38s -> 9145.26s]  He's still alive.
[9145.26s -> 9146.30s]  All right, unable to know.
[9146.30s -> 9148.38s]  All right, just death penalty.
[9148.38s -> 9150.46s]  Get my reputation back up.
[9151.83s -> 9152.31s]  Sign it.
[9159.18s -> 9160.14s]  Everybody's on board.
[9161.00s -> 9163.72s]  The crowd in front of the building is enraged.
[9163.72s -> 9165.80s]  There may be soon a massacre.
[9165.80s -> 9168.28s]  Oh god, a rumor has spread
[9168.28s -> 9170.52s]  about hidden evidence of Citizen Capay's treason.
[9170.52s -> 9171.48s]  People have gone mad.
[9172.28s -> 9173.08s]  What evidence?
[9174.23s -> 9175.11s]  I will go to them.
[9175.11s -> 9177.67s]  I would ask you all to stay in your seats until I return.
[9179.06s -> 9180.10s]  Uh oh, this is bad.
[9183.58s -> 9184.46s]  Why do I have to do this?
[9185.69s -> 9187.53s]  People, what vexes you?
[9188.33s -> 9189.53s]  Why are you so angry?
[9189.53s -> 9190.49s]  Is he the one talking?
[9192.06s -> 9193.18s]  The king lied to us.
[9195.64s -> 9197.40s]  That coward ran from us.
[9197.40s -> 9199.56s]  He'll surely run from justice as well.
[9199.56s -> 9200.44s]  No, we're gonna kill him.
[9200.44s -> 9201.08s]  I already did it.
[9201.96s -> 9204.36s]  We found proof of the king's treachery
[9204.36s -> 9206.04s]  in his secret iron cabinet.
[9209.43s -> 9210.63s]  Oh shit, okay.
[9211.67s -> 9214.23s]  Citizen Capay shall not escape justice.
[9215.27s -> 9216.31s]  Aggression, humility.
[9216.31s -> 9217.27s]  How many points do I have?
[9221.21s -> 9222.49s]  Believe in me.
[9223.78s -> 9224.82s]  I'm just winging it.
[9226.81s -> 9231.13s]  Yeah, that, like, he's not going to escape justice.
[9231.69s -> 9235.27s]  The evidence from the iron cabinet will be examined,
[9237.27s -> 9241.05s]  manipulate, and then believe in me.
[9242.63s -> 9243.19s]  Humility.
[9247.53s -> 9248.49s]  They're all withdrawn.
[9249.21s -> 9249.77s]  Manipulate.
[9251.99s -> 9252.87s]  Full aggro.
[9262.09s -> 9263.21s]  All full aggro.
[9265.77s -> 9267.05s]  No, no, this is aggressive.
[9270.26s -> 9271.38s]  And then probably humility,
[9271.38s -> 9272.66s]  because people are already,
[9272.66s -> 9274.02s]  humility and then manipulation.
[9274.58s -> 9276.02s]  People are withdrawn.
[9276.02s -> 9278.10s]  I can, like, do the dance, right?
[9278.98s -> 9279.70s]  Or humility.
[9282.66s -> 9283.54s]  I would even do humility.
[9283.54s -> 9284.66s]  Maybe both of them.
[9284.66s -> 9291.14s]  I still have the points.
[9291.14s -> 9292.90s]  Yeah, the withdraw, withdrawn, withdrawn.
[9292.90s -> 9294.18s]  Manipulate, manipulate.
[9294.18s -> 9295.62s]  Aggression, manipulate, manipulate.
[9296.84s -> 9298.68s]  Or aggression, humility, humility.
[9299.24s -> 9302.60s]  I'm doing it.
[9302.60s -> 9303.00s]  Fuck it.
[9303.00s -> 9303.64s]  Let's go.
[9303.64s -> 9304.36s]  Yes!
[9304.36s -> 9304.60s]  Yes!
[9306.06s -> 9307.66s]  Yeah, I'm so fucking pumped up right now.
[9307.66s -> 9308.54s]  I'm so fucking pumped.
[9311.11s -> 9312.87s]  The king has been imprisoned.
[9313.43s -> 9315.11s]  He will not escape a second time.
[9315.83s -> 9319.27s]  If he tries, I will kill him with my own bare hands.
[9322.70s -> 9323.66s]  Ah, doubtful.
[9323.66s -> 9324.62s]  You're not that strong.
[9325.18s -> 9328.06s]  Each new piece of evidence will be thoroughly examined.
[9328.06s -> 9330.14s]  The republic's standards demand nothing less.
[9330.70s -> 9332.62s]  I shall follow them to the letter.
[9332.62s -> 9334.30s]  Okay, I guess.
[9335.34s -> 9336.22s]  Intrigued.
[9337.42s -> 9339.02s]  I know that you might be angry.
[9339.74s -> 9342.54s]  But you have chosen your representatives to protect you.
[9343.34s -> 9344.30s]  Believe in me.
[9346.62s -> 9349.64s]  Yeah, they bought it.
[9350.28s -> 9352.71s]  Plus two reputation, plus two influence,
[9352.71s -> 9355.43s]  and then plus five common folk endorsement were back.
[9359.90s -> 9360.94s]  So what happened out there?
[9361.66s -> 9362.30s]  It is true.
[9362.30s -> 9364.30s]  Evidence of Capete's guilt has been found.
[9365.40s -> 9365.88s]  Really?
[9366.68s -> 9371.16s]  Would the defendant like to explain why he concealed his secure iron cabinet
[9371.16s -> 9373.64s]  and the documents hidden within from the convention?
[9375.03s -> 9377.35s]  I hid nothing from the convention.
[9377.91s -> 9380.63s]  No one asked me about the existence of such things.
[9381.27s -> 9384.76s]  You kept your correspondence well hidden under lock and key.
[9384.76s -> 9389.48s]  It could only be retrieved only the assistance of a master locksmith.
[9393.99s -> 9397.75s]  Any affluent Parisian has a lockable cabinet.
[9397.75s -> 9400.15s]  I for one am keenly interested in locksmithing.
[9403.18s -> 9404.06s]  Let's go.
[9404.06s -> 9404.94s]  Wait, is there more?
[9406.57s -> 9407.93s]  Oh shit, there's more?
[9410.18s -> 9411.22s]  No, no, no, no.
[9411.22s -> 9412.58s]  What is all this other stuff?
[9413.54s -> 9415.22s]  It's like a fucking bunch of papers.
[9420.82s -> 9421.86s]  Get these both out of here.
[9422.50s -> 9422.98s]  What is this?
[9425.99s -> 9426.95s]  Shoot the rebels.
[9426.95s -> 9427.99s]  No, no, that's this one.
[9427.99s -> 9428.87s]  What is this?
[9428.87s -> 9431.91s]  The deputies of the so-called national assembly are to be carefully questioned,
[9431.91s -> 9435.19s]  and if any of them should display common sense and cease to support the assembly,
[9435.19s -> 9439.75s]  reward him with an extraordinarily high allowance and forward his majesty's thanks.
[9443.40s -> 9445.40s]  We trust that with God's grace and help,
[9445.40s -> 9451.26s]  his majesty will soon arrive within the imperial borders for us to grant H.M.
[9451.26s -> 9455.10s]  as well as our beloved sister's safety and to potentially take the steps necessary
[9455.10s -> 9458.62s]  to reestablish the natural European order within the borders of France.
[9459.77s -> 9463.45s]  His imperial majesty, the Holy Roman Emperor, King Hungary,
[9463.45s -> 9467.45s]  Bohemia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Slovenia, Galicia,
[9467.45s -> 9469.61s]  Latin America, etc.
[9470.33s -> 9473.77s]  Whoa, your country doesn't get to be added, you're in the etc.
[9473.77s -> 9474.73s]  I'd be pissed about that.
[9475.69s -> 9477.13s]  You start wars over that shit.
[9479.02s -> 9481.75s]  A.D. 1791, 15th of May.
[9484.52s -> 9488.12s]  And your grace, soon we will come to your majesty's rescue.
[9489.21s -> 9494.25s]  However, for the time being, I implore you, Y.M.,
[9494.25s -> 9497.37s]  to muster local troops that remain loyal.
[9497.37s -> 9502.25s]  I shall issue a warning to Y.M.'s subjects that any and all who dare raise a hand
[9502.25s -> 9505.77s]  against Y.M. would suffer the du-rest of consequences.
[9505.77s -> 9510.65s]  My armies await my orders to curb the tide of anarchy in Y.M.'s country.
[9511.29s -> 9516.41s]  Duke of Brunswick, Lundberg, Charles William Ferdinand, A.D. 1792, 9th of June.
[9518.33s -> 9519.37s]  That wasn't even a cough.
[9520.57s -> 9521.85s]  It's a pretend cough.
[9522.89s -> 9525.77s]  All right, get them out there, get them to the gallows, let's go.
[9526.33s -> 9527.93s]  How is the jury not reached what they think?
[9528.89s -> 9532.31s]  Wait, what?
[9537.02s -> 9539.02s]  Must be pun- try- all right, there's more.
[9539.58s -> 9540.70s]  There are new questions.
[9541.42s -> 9545.62s]  Louis Quipet tried to defend his absolute authority by plotting against
[9545.62s -> 9548.10s]  the National Consistuate Assembly and the people of France.
[9548.10s -> 9550.26s]  We all remember July of 1789.
[9550.26s -> 9554.74s]  He gathered an army, 15 foreign regiments, and ordered them to surround Paris.
[9554.74s -> 9559.54s]  Soldiers led by Baron de Bessenval were to capture deputies and shoot at citizens
[9559.54s -> 9561.54s]  defending the reforms, and so they did.
[9561.54s -> 9563.38s]  The royal German regiment drew first blood.
[9564.66s -> 9567.88s]  After the plot failed- I just read this.
[9569.69s -> 9570.49s]  No, I didn't.
[9570.49s -> 9571.96s]  It was more after that.
[9572.84s -> 9573.64s]  Whatever, we'll do it.
[9574.76s -> 9578.28s]  Louis Quipet tried to flee the country with his family and scheme with foreign
[9578.28s -> 9579.56s]  monarchs abroad.
[9579.56s -> 9584.04s]  Is that not the reason for him leaving that one night in June of 1791?
[9585.08s -> 9585.56s]  Who knows.
[9587.35s -> 9591.67s]  Louis Quipet will never abandon the thoughts of suppressing the revolution by force
[9591.67s -> 9593.11s]  before the events of 1792.
[9593.11s -> 9597.11s]  He gave orders for the Swiss Guard stationed in the Toulouse to be doubled.
[9597.11s -> 9600.31s]  He conducted a public buster in front of horrified citizens.
[9600.31s -> 9608.30s]  The people had no choice.
[9608.30s -> 9610.14s]  They had to act before Quipet attacked.
[9610.70s -> 9614.30s]  Citizens of Paris who tried to stop the madness were shot at even after
[9614.30s -> 9615.98s]  Quipet's escape to the National Assembly.
[9616.54s -> 9621.10s]  An order issued by the marshal, instructions issued by the minister,
[9622.06s -> 9624.78s]  a letter from the emperor, and a letter from the duke.
[9625.90s -> 9627.18s]  Let's bring it down.
[9627.90s -> 9629.56s]  So a letter from the duke.
[9629.56s -> 9630.68s]  I would call that evidence.
[9631.24s -> 9633.30s]  We've got a letter from the emperor.
[9633.38s -> 9634.10s]  What'd you call that?
[9634.10s -> 9635.38s]  I'd call that evidence.
[9635.38s -> 9637.14s]  You got the minister's order.
[9637.14s -> 9639.70s]  I would call that, hold on, attempted escape.
[9639.70s -> 9643.22s]  I would call that a fucking counter-revolutionary term
[9644.33s -> 9645.29s]  or course of events.
[9646.31s -> 9647.43s]  Suppressing the revolution.
[9648.47s -> 9649.43s]  That's your method.
[9649.43s -> 9651.19s]  That's your method to do that.
[9655.37s -> 9656.57s]  That's the method.
[9656.57s -> 9657.13s]  It's not.
[9657.13s -> 9658.49s]  That's the course of actions.
[9660.92s -> 9673.82s]  Uh-oh.
[9673.82s -> 9674.70s]  And that's your method.
[9675.82s -> 9677.43s]  Bingo!
[9679.45s -> 9680.33s]  More questions.
[9680.33s -> 9680.73s]  All right.
[9682.55s -> 9685.83s]  Were you aware of the plans of the emperor and the duke of Brunswick?
[9685.83s -> 9686.71s]  Why did you not...
[9687.91s -> 9690.71s]  Why did you not warn the National Assembly and the army?
[9694.87s -> 9695.91s]  You need to speak up.
[9696.63s -> 9699.98s]  I did not deem their threat serious.
[9703.02s -> 9703.50s]  Treason.
[9704.30s -> 9705.26s]  Allow me to quote you.
[9708.01s -> 9710.17s]  My armies await my orders.
[9710.17s -> 9712.01s]  Does that not sound like a serious threat?
[9713.59s -> 9715.35s]  Prince Charles is impetuous,
[9715.43s -> 9717.51s]  but I never once thought he would dare attack France.
[9718.31s -> 9720.78s]  All right, everyone wants him dead.
[9722.23s -> 9725.27s]  Did the accused intend to lead the emperor's forces to France?
[9727.56s -> 9728.60s]  I certainly did not.
[9729.86s -> 9735.70s]  In his letter, the emperor was quite clear about his intentions to return order to France.
[9736.66s -> 9738.66s]  I do not know plans of Emperor Leopold,
[9738.66s -> 9741.86s]  but I do know that I would never allow anyone to spill French blood.
[9743.03s -> 9746.87s]  But you must admit that such an offer from an enemy government paints you in a bad light.
[9748.46s -> 9752.22s]  Dear God, is it merely personal correspondence from my brother-in-law?
[9752.86s -> 9758.33s]  It's not personal when the letters exchanged are by rulers and deal in matters of national security.
[9760.89s -> 9761.21s]  All right.
[9761.21s -> 9762.17s]  Let's calm it down a little.
[9763.93s -> 9764.41s]  Oh, shit.
[9764.41s -> 9765.13s]  They're going to riot.
[9765.69s -> 9776.50s]  He's going to die.
[9778.33s -> 9780.01s]  Did the defendant confess to the crime?
[9780.01s -> 9781.14s]  No.
[9781.14s -> 9784.10s]  Who was corrupting politicians on Citizen Cafe's request?
[9786.66s -> 9790.10s]  Did Citizen Cafe explain his reasoning behind Roland's mission of corruption?
[9790.10s -> 9795.54s]  He denies the situation took place, and I don't know who did this.
[9798.22s -> 9799.98s]  I think it was, was it Roland?
[9807.35s -> 9808.95s]  He literally just said it.
[9831.19s -> 9836.87s]  Say a letter.
[9836.87s -> 9837.83s]  Look at that boost.
[9838.95s -> 9845.03s]  I, Sigward of Katarina, sentence Citizen Cafe to death by guillotine.
[9845.03s -> 9846.15s]  Take the convict away.
[9848.44s -> 9849.56s]  Long live the people.
[9849.56s -> 9850.60s]  Down with the tyrant.
[9852.74s -> 9857.40s]  Oh, damn.
[9857.40s -> 9863.48s]  Good job.
[9863.48s -> 9864.92s]  Got some extra influence points.
[9867.18s -> 9867.82s]  He's ours.
[9871.03s -> 9871.91s]  Okay, let's go watch.
[9876.42s -> 9877.30s]  No one's upset with me.
[9877.30s -> 9879.78s]  Yeah, but everybody wanted it.
[9879.78s -> 9886.55s]  Understand?
[9889.96s -> 9894.36s]  Their excitement was stronger than the smell of the fresh wood the guillotine was made from.
[9895.08s -> 9898.74s]  Know what's about to happen?
[9901.86s -> 9903.22s]  Turbo vs. Star.
[9903.22s -> 9906.58s]  Sheep that only now realize they used to have fangs and claws.
[9907.06s -> 9907.56s]  Oh.
[9934.54s -> 9939.18s]  The guy in the bottom right is every created character that allows me that haircut
[9939.18s -> 9941.74s]  has that haircut for every game I play with the creative character.
[9943.72s -> 9946.12s]  I was unable to understand their screams.
[9946.92s -> 9949.32s]  I only tasted the stench of their sweaty bodies.
[9951.54s -> 9953.30s]  But I could hear one thing perfectly.
[9954.10s -> 9957.93s]  Bring us the king.
[9962.38s -> 9963.10s]  Time for a speech.
[9964.20s -> 9965.08s]  This one's important.
[9968.74s -> 9973.96s]  All right, so we have oversensitive, crime, revolution.
[9973.96s -> 9974.60s]  I have points.
[9976.58s -> 9977.70s]  So they've withdrawn.
[9982.04s -> 9985.00s]  They're oversensitive about the king,
[9986.49s -> 9988.01s]  which means we could do humility here.
[9993.40s -> 9994.04s]  Revolution.
[9994.92s -> 9995.64s]  Manipulation.
[9997.59s -> 9998.55s]  Full aggro.
[9999.11s -> 10007.77s]  I'm not going to do full aggro.
[10008.65s -> 10012.49s]  Humility is better for withdrawn, I think.
[10013.21s -> 10014.49s]  Why would you use carelessness?
[10015.13s -> 10024.47s]  And then oversensitive.
[10024.47s -> 10030.41s]  That's, yeah, I mean, that's either manipulation.
[10030.41s -> 10031.37s]  Aye, yai, yai.
[10032.25s -> 10035.21s]  All right, well, defendant is manipulation is perfect.
[10036.01s -> 10037.53s]  So withdrawn, is it all?
[10039.59s -> 10042.89s]  Nobody wants to be shouted at when they're withdrawn.
[10044.62s -> 10045.58s]  Maybe carelessness.
[10051.06s -> 10054.18s]  Maybe aggressive for the crime, but not aggressive for revolution.
[10054.18s -> 10055.06s]  Maybe, I don't know.
[10055.94s -> 10057.70s]  I would say manipulation for revolution.
[10063.29s -> 10065.21s]  Crime aggressive might work here.
[10065.21s -> 10069.66s]  Aggressive manipulation and then, I don't know.
[10070.38s -> 10072.66s]  Let's try aggressive here.
[10073.30s -> 10078.10s]  Disorder shall be suppressed with the brutal strength of our truth.
[10078.10s -> 10079.30s]  No turning back now.
[10079.94s -> 10080.66s]  All right, that was good.
[10081.22s -> 10083.13s]  And then manipulation for the defendant.
[10083.77s -> 10087.72s]  These offenders want to go back to the old ways they defend them.
[10088.28s -> 10088.92s]  Intrigued.
[10090.44s -> 10091.80s]  And then revolution.
[10092.60s -> 10093.88s]  Let's go with manipulation again.
[10094.44s -> 10099.48s]  Aggression.
[10103.22s -> 10106.58s]  These criminals think that because we are tolerant, we are so weak that is not enough.
[10108.10s -> 10117.91s]  Speaking of not enough, who comes?
[10117.91s -> 10119.59s]  I die as an innocent man.
[10119.59s -> 10121.11s]  I forgive my enemies.
[10121.83s -> 10132.12s]  For the revolution.
[10132.12s -> 10135.08s]  All the road.
[10135.08s -> 10146.46s]  Do they ever clean this thing?
[10147.59s -> 10148.31s]  Somebody probably does.
[10148.31s -> 10149.11s]  Maybe like once a week.
[10149.67s -> 10153.38s]  I must be dreaming.
[10153.38s -> 10155.78s]  Is that the map from the Muggler's case?
[10155.78s -> 10157.70s]  You stole evidence from the court?
[10158.34s -> 10160.06s]  I did not steal it.
[10160.62s -> 10162.22s]  Only found a use for it.
[10162.22s -> 10166.46s]  It will be more useful in your room than in the dusty drawers of the court archives.
[10167.26s -> 10172.22s]  After all, this is a map by Turgo and should be traded with respect.
[10172.86s -> 10174.84s]  What a lovely explanation.
[10175.40s -> 10176.79s]  Consider it a gift.
[10177.35s -> 10178.15s]  Take it.
[10178.15s -> 10179.59s]  And try not to talk so much.
[10180.23s -> 10182.55s]  You should be more concerned about the events with the king.
[10183.27s -> 10185.51s]  Because this whole situation just seems pretty.
[10185.51s -> 10190.68s]  As your superior, I should be the one judging your ways and case.
[10190.68s -> 10197.18s]  I failed to understand why Rumpus Spear asked for your assistance.
[10197.18s -> 10198.06s]  Wait, are you jealous?
[10199.21s -> 10200.33s]  Of course I'm jealous.
[10201.27s -> 10207.22s]  It is an important moment in history and people will be reading about it.
[10207.22s -> 10207.94s]  People hate this.
[10208.58s -> 10209.70s]  It seems there will be trouble.
[10209.70s -> 10211.70s]  I have a feeling that someone is toying with my life
[10211.70s -> 10214.10s]  as though an unknown force were pushing me into utter chaos.
[10216.10s -> 10217.62s]  Keep your eyes open.
[10217.62s -> 10221.70s]  You came to the political world of this city from out of nowhere.
[10221.70s -> 10224.26s]  And that means someone will have to step down to make room.
[10226.52s -> 10228.60s]  Do you have to sound so defeated?
[10228.60s -> 10230.52s]  My husband is a renowned person now.
[10230.52s -> 10233.78s]  We should be happy about it.
[10233.78s -> 10235.94s]  It is easier to shoot someone in the spotlight.
[10242.20s -> 10243.16s]  Evening stroll.
[10248.01s -> 10250.18s]  Whoa, we just unlocked one.
[10250.18s -> 10252.68s]  Demonstration.
[10252.68s -> 10255.69s]  Let them see real life up close.
[10255.69s -> 10256.33s]  No, no, no, no.
[10256.33s -> 10258.14s]  We gotta chill out here.
[10258.14s -> 10259.02s]  Evening stroll.
[10259.02s -> 10261.40s]  No, hates that.
[10261.40s -> 10262.20s]  Political debate.
[10262.20s -> 10263.40s]  He hates that too.
[10263.40s -> 10264.52s]  Paragraphs and codes.
[10271.62s -> 10272.90s]  Take a walk with dad.
[10281.66s -> 10282.86s]  Let's go to demonstration.
[10282.86s -> 10283.98s]  Let's go see it.
[10283.98s -> 10288.79s]  Let's go.
[10288.79s -> 10292.92s]  Full bar.
[10292.92s -> 10302.04s]  Full bar.
[10302.04s -> 10303.08s]  Alt is ready.
[10304.28s -> 10314.44s]  The people have shrugged the invisible burden off their backs.
[10315.16s -> 10316.76s]  The streets seem more peaceful.
[10317.56s -> 10320.28s]  Even the windows at the courthouse were soon replaced.
[10321.00s -> 10323.78s]  That's the whole day?
[10323.86s -> 10324.34s]  Oh, okay.
[10326.10s -> 10328.78s]  Oh, look at all these points.
[10329.58s -> 10332.95s]  Dear Citizen Fidel, I am writing to congratulate you
[10332.95s -> 10335.03s]  on becoming a part of our country's history.
[10335.03s -> 10337.43s]  Citizen Cafe's trial is on everyone's lips.
[10337.43s -> 10339.59s]  I would also like to discuss the important topic
[10339.59s -> 10341.35s]  of appointing the new commander-in-chief
[10341.35s -> 10344.71s]  of the National Guard who will replace Citizen Burel.
[10345.35s -> 10348.31s]  It is my honest belief that I am the best candidate.
[10348.95s -> 10350.55s]  So would you give me your permission?
[10350.55s -> 10352.55s]  I would like to pay you a visit this evening.
[10352.55s -> 10354.07s]  Long live the Republic.
[10354.07s -> 10355.75s]  Francois Henriot.
[10359.83s -> 10360.23s]  All right.
[10360.23s -> 10364.15s]  So we have burglary, assault, theft, destruction of property.
[10368.30s -> 10372.22s]  And we have people, revolutionaries want prison.
[10372.86s -> 10373.98s]  Common folk want acquittal.
[10376.22s -> 10376.94s]  All right.
[10376.94s -> 10377.98s]  Let's take a look at the case.
[10379.77s -> 10380.33s]  One of the two.
[10382.60s -> 10383.88s]  But first of all, Juno.
[10385.08s -> 10386.52s]  Juno Obsetto.
[10386.52s -> 10388.36s]  Juno Obsetto, thanks for the five community subs.
[10389.90s -> 10390.94s]  Five subs.
[10391.66s -> 10393.66s]  Just rifling in right now.
[10393.66s -> 10393.98s]  Thank you.
[10394.62s -> 10398.01s]  Really appreciate that.
[10398.01s -> 10403.42s]  That was Juno Obsetto.
[10406.58s -> 10411.38s]  So we have, before the court stands, Claude Garnier,
[10411.94s -> 10415.78s]  a resident of Paris and a baker's apprentice, arrested for robbery.
[10415.78s -> 10418.10s]  He led a group of people who broke into the house
[10418.10s -> 10421.14s]  of citizen Dominique Fournier, a wealthy man.
[10421.86s -> 10424.90s]  According to Fournier's testimony, the robbers insulted him
[10424.90s -> 10426.90s]  and then began beating him.
[10427.54s -> 10429.61s]  All right.
[10429.61s -> 10432.89s]  At the same time, Claude told his accomplices,
[10433.37s -> 10435.05s]  which expensive belonging should be taken,
[10435.05s -> 10438.41s]  and the group left the battered Fournier lying on the floor.
[10439.13s -> 10441.13s]  Many witnesses saw the whole incident.
[10441.13s -> 10443.93s]  Fournier's servants saw present during the events,
[10444.65s -> 10446.65s]  while some passers-by looked through the windows.
[10451.06s -> 10453.54s]  Garnier not only admitted to leading the group,
[10453.54s -> 10455.14s]  but he actually boasted about it,
[10455.14s -> 10457.86s]  calling it a revolutionary deed of which he was proud.
[10458.50s -> 10461.86s]  He supposedly found out that Fournier is funding
[10461.86s -> 10463.30s]  counterrevolutionary leaflets
[10463.30s -> 10465.38s]  and decided to relieve him of his funds.
[10466.42s -> 10470.14s]  The accused would not reveal the source of the information.
[10470.14s -> 10473.82s]  He handed the guards a lampoon of Robespierre,
[10474.38s -> 10476.38s]  claiming that he had found a thick pile of them
[10476.38s -> 10477.18s]  in the victim's house.
[10478.15s -> 10482.31s]  Garnier claimed to having burned all but one,
[10482.31s -> 10483.67s]  which he kept as evidence.
[10484.31s -> 10485.59s]  When the guards arrested him,
[10485.59s -> 10488.71s]  they noticed a gold signet ring on his finger
[10488.71s -> 10490.47s]  that belonged to Fournier.
[10491.35s -> 10492.55s]  Okay.
[10492.55s -> 10495.91s]  Garnier often takes a stand during the gatherings of the Engrage,
[10496.47s -> 10499.03s]  demanding that all wealthy people be hanged.
[10499.99s -> 10503.27s]  In the year 1789, he took part in the storming of the Bastille.
[10507.29s -> 10510.52s]  So let's go.
[10511.08s -> 10513.72s]  So we have the...
[10514.68s -> 10518.78s]  There's a trap here, though.
[10520.44s -> 10521.64s]  Assaulting the victim is...
[10524.04s -> 10524.84s]  Who is the witness here?
[10524.84s -> 10525.24s]  We have...
[10525.88s -> 10527.75s]  There's one of the servants.
[10527.75s -> 10528.71s]  One of the servants was a witness.
[10529.43s -> 10530.07s]  So that's one.
[10530.87s -> 10537.78s]  Freeing the Bastille prisoners.
[10537.78s -> 10538.34s]  That's a...
[10540.95s -> 10545.96s]  The gold signet is evidence.
[10549.74s -> 10550.78s]  I'm afraid of a trap here.
[10550.78s -> 10554.71s]  Break-in is the accusation, right?
[10554.71s -> 10560.95s]  I mean, I want to see what's going on.
[10560.95s -> 10562.94s]  He led a group of people
[10563.58s -> 10566.50s]  broke into the house of Dominique Fournier,
[10566.50s -> 10567.14s]  a wealthy man.
[10570.49s -> 10571.05s]  God.
[10571.05s -> 10572.57s]  According to Fournier's testimony...
[10573.21s -> 10573.53s]  All right.
[10573.53s -> 10583.48s]  So break-in is the accusation.
[10584.04s -> 10587.99s]  Assaulting the victim is an accusation.
[10588.55s -> 10591.75s]  I feel like the funding thing is a trap.
[10596.41s -> 10597.37s]  Funding leaflets...
[10602.28s -> 10608.41s]  No.
[10608.41s -> 10608.73s]  Shit.
[10609.29s -> 10617.35s]  We need more people like Gagné.
[10617.35s -> 10620.62s]  Please introduce yourself.
[10620.62s -> 10622.54s]  My name is Claude Gagné.
[10622.54s -> 10625.26s]  You are accused of breaking into the house of Citizen Fournier,
[10625.26s -> 10627.58s]  whom you then brutally assaulted and robbed.
[10628.22s -> 10630.44s]  I led an investigation of his house.
[10630.44s -> 10631.48s]  Viva la révolution.
[10632.44s -> 10632.76s]  Good.
[10636.07s -> 10637.03s]  Is that what you're gonna yell?
[10638.49s -> 10639.77s]  That's the reaction somebody has
[10639.77s -> 10641.53s]  when they've been paying attention to their iPhone.
[10641.93s -> 10643.21s]  And are asked for a comment.
[10645.56s -> 10646.04s]  Good.
[10646.04s -> 10646.36s]  Yeah.
[10647.37s -> 10650.17s]  Who gave you the right to represent the revolution?
[10650.81s -> 10652.15s]  The people of Paris.
[10653.18s -> 10653.90s]  Sure we did.
[10654.54s -> 10656.07s]  Is that sarcastic or...
[10660.54s -> 10661.66s]  It's motive.
[10661.66s -> 10664.14s]  Fine.
[10664.14s -> 10664.46s]  No.
[10664.46s -> 10665.98s]  One of these is a trap.
[10669.67s -> 10670.39s]  Fine answer.
[10671.03s -> 10672.07s]  There's the trap.
[10672.07s -> 10672.79s]  There's the trap.
[10674.79s -> 10678.09s]  That's okay.
[10680.71s -> 10681.51s]  All right.
[10681.51s -> 10683.59s]  So he was beaten.
[10683.59s -> 10684.79s]  Why was he severely beaten?
[10685.35s -> 10687.32s]  He could have avoided it, yes.
[10687.32s -> 10688.52s]  I punched him once or twice.
[10689.00s -> 10691.08s]  Only because he kept squealing like a pig.
[10691.64s -> 10693.56s]  Are you proud of yourself?
[10693.56s -> 10694.60s]  He got what he deserved.
[10695.56s -> 10697.08s]  Royalists are animals.
[10697.72s -> 10701.45s]  He kept squealing when you were turning his place over.
[10702.01s -> 10704.97s]  He was plotting against decent Parisians.
[10704.97s -> 10705.69s]  Isn't that enough?
[10706.49s -> 10707.77s]  We'll kill that dog.
[10709.96s -> 10710.28s]  Okay.
[10711.00s -> 10716.62s]  Would you like...
[10716.62s -> 10717.10s]  Would you...
[10717.66s -> 10719.66s]  Why would you think that the victim had anything to do with...
[10719.66s -> 10721.18s]  You were found with a gold signet.
[10721.18s -> 10721.42s]  Yeah.
[10722.14s -> 10725.46s]  I have reason to believe that it belonged to the victim.
[10725.46s -> 10725.94s]  Am I right?
[10727.08s -> 10729.16s]  Why do you keep calling him a victim?
[10729.16s -> 10730.76s]  He's a rich traitor.
[10730.76s -> 10732.44s]  The true victims of the people of France.
[10734.25s -> 10735.69s]  You know what we're talking about.
[10735.69s -> 10737.85s]  And we will take care of him in due course.
[10737.85s -> 10739.29s]  Now what about that signet?
[10740.18s -> 10740.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[10740.66s -> 10741.46s]  The signet.
[10741.46s -> 10742.18s]  Nice, isn't it?
[10742.74s -> 10745.54s]  Those swines got fat off our hard work.
[10745.54s -> 10747.78s]  And they refused to give us a tiny part of their wealth.
[10747.78s -> 10748.82s]  Not even the tiniest.
[10749.70s -> 10750.20s]  Huzzah!
[10750.82s -> 10753.08s]  What did you plan to do with it?
[10753.96s -> 10754.36s]  Nothing.
[10754.36s -> 10755.56s]  Looked nice on my finger.
[10755.56s -> 10756.68s]  Much better than on that pig.
[10757.32s -> 10760.07s]  The signet was not only the thing you took.
[10761.22s -> 10762.18s]  It wasn't the only thing.
[10762.82s -> 10763.38s]  Was it?
[10763.38s -> 10765.46s]  I heard the house was stripped of everything precious.
[10766.42s -> 10768.98s]  I was especially fond of those gold-plated candlesticks.
[10773.26s -> 10773.66s]  All right.
[10773.66s -> 10773.90s]  Well.
[10776.12s -> 10778.12s]  Why would you think that the victim had anything to do
[10779.88s -> 10781.72s]  with the counter-revolutionary activity?
[10782.81s -> 10783.93s]  Ask anyone on the street.
[10783.93s -> 10785.29s]  They all knew about it.
[10785.29s -> 10787.61s]  Only no one had any proof and we were tired of waiting.
[10788.42s -> 10789.38s]  How did they know?
[10789.38s -> 10790.74s]  Did the rats talk to them?
[10791.54s -> 10792.58s]  Well, I just knew.
[10792.58s -> 10795.61s]  People always know what's going on.
[10795.61s -> 10797.85s]  We always smell a filthy royalist.
[10798.57s -> 10801.59s]  So you decided to find evidence of Fournier's guilt.
[10802.82s -> 10805.86s]  Whenever someone's suspected of a crime, there's an investigation.
[10805.86s -> 10806.90s]  No.
[10806.90s -> 10808.02s]  We decided to do one.
[10808.58s -> 10810.06s]  Do I understand correctly?
[10810.06s -> 10811.34s]  Let me just make sure I understand.
[10811.34s -> 10812.54s]  Do I get this?
[10812.54s -> 10815.18s]  You assaulted Citizen Fournier because of some rumors.
[10815.18s -> 10816.14s]  Am I getting that?
[10816.14s -> 10816.86s]  Do I get that correctly?
[10818.36s -> 10821.16s]  Mr. Judge, are you implying that Parisians are liars?
[10822.92s -> 10824.84s]  I'm the one who asked the questions here.
[10824.92s -> 10825.40s]  Not you.
[10826.50s -> 10828.58s]  The judge is on the side of the bourgeoisie.
[10829.53s -> 10832.28s]  Uh-oh.
[10832.28s -> 10834.36s]  That was a family guy to your joke.
[10850.94s -> 10851.98s]  Oh, give me a break.
[10852.78s -> 10853.18s]  Whatever.
[10858.62s -> 10860.87s]  Let's get the witness in here.
[10860.87s -> 10863.67s]  The victim's servant, Gaten Cave.
[10869.70s -> 10872.02s]  Why did you not try to interrupt or defend the victim?
[10873.78s -> 10874.74s]  Why didn't you do that?
[10876.49s -> 10876.99s]  Me?
[10877.86s -> 10878.36s]  Yes.
[10878.84s -> 10881.31s]  I only said why.
[10881.31s -> 10883.55s]  What chance would I have against a group of thugs?
[10888.73s -> 10890.09s]  Did they attack you as well?
[10891.63s -> 10893.15s]  Fortunately, they didn't.
[10896.27s -> 10899.47s]  It is clear that their aim was the bourgeoisie and not the common people.
[10899.47s -> 10900.43s]  Did you call for help?
[10901.71s -> 10904.03s]  I yelled, but nobody came.
[10909.05s -> 10909.85s]  I yelled.
[10915.00s -> 10916.20s]  I yelled.
[10916.20s -> 10919.42s]  Why didn't you call the police with the phones that don't exist?
[10919.42s -> 10921.50s]  They screamed out the window like they used to do.
[10921.50s -> 10922.00s]  All right.
[10922.56s -> 10929.47s]  After you were arrested, you handed the guards a slanderous leaflet about citizen Robb's Pier.
[10930.11s -> 10933.65s]  I found it in the royalist's pig's house.
[10933.65s -> 10936.37s]  There were scores of them there, and we burned them all in the street.
[10937.74s -> 10938.24s]  Wonderful.
[10939.31s -> 10940.99s]  You did not burn that one.
[10941.55s -> 10943.90s]  I saved it just in case, you know, I needed it for something.
[10944.83s -> 10946.99s]  How can we be sure it belonged to Faunier?
[10947.55s -> 10949.18s]  Where else would I have found it?
[10949.74s -> 10952.29s]  Tell us exactly where you found it.
[10952.85s -> 10956.35s]  He had piles of these leaflets in a recess there.
[10957.82s -> 10958.32s]  Plotter!
[10959.02s -> 10959.52s]  Scum!
[10961.02s -> 10963.66s]  Why did you not go to the guard with the leaflet at once?
[10965.17s -> 10965.73s]  Why would I?
[10966.61s -> 10969.73s]  With evidence like that, you could be sure the accused would meet the guillotine.
[10973.14s -> 10974.02s]  He's right.
[10974.02s -> 10975.86s]  You should have brought the leaflet to the guard.
[10976.34s -> 10982.35s]  They're on my side now.
[10982.35s -> 10985.74s]  Did you really take part in the storming of the Bastille?
[10985.74s -> 10986.24s]  I did.
[10987.02s -> 10988.38s]  What a hero, one of us.
[10991.54s -> 10992.83s]  There's just chat back there.
[10992.83s -> 10993.33s]  It really is.
[10994.03s -> 10995.47s]  Was your experience helpful?
[10995.47s -> 10998.43s]  The only thing missing was Delaunay's head raised on a pike.
[10999.07s -> 11001.36s]  That's another difference.
[11001.36s -> 11002.80s]  I wasn't arrested for doing it.
[11002.80s -> 11004.72s]  Everyone knew what they were doing, the right thing.
[11005.44s -> 11006.96s]  The Bastille was a fortress.
[11006.96s -> 11009.60s]  We are talking about breaking into the house of an unarmed man
[11009.60s -> 11010.96s]  and that is why we have doubts.
[11012.99s -> 11015.15s]  You mean an unarmed, royalist pig?
[11018.05s -> 11018.55s]  All right.
[11019.01s -> 11021.04s]  Common folk want acquittal.
[11021.68s -> 11023.20s]  Revolutionaries want prison.
[11023.20s -> 11027.28s]  Why meet you?
[11027.28s -> 11028.56s]  Did they confess to the crimes?
[11028.56s -> 11029.06s]  Yeah.
[11030.03s -> 11031.55s]  Common revolutionary in nature?
[11033.07s -> 11033.57s]  No.
[11033.87s -> 11035.95s]  What made the defendant famous in the eyes of the people?
[11036.59s -> 11038.54s]  He took part in the storming of the Bastille.
[11043.31s -> 11044.11s]  Kill him is a joke.
[11048.13s -> 11049.01s]  I'm not going to kill him.
[11049.57s -> 11052.05s]  I'm going to put him in prison.
[11052.05s -> 11062.94s]  Nobody wants that.
[11062.94s -> 11063.44s]  Prison.
[11063.98s -> 11064.48s]  Acquittal.
[11065.42s -> 11065.90s]  Wait a minute.
[11065.90s -> 11066.40s]  Hold on.
[11067.44s -> 11068.56s]  Reputation bonus.
[11072.45s -> 11075.17s]  No, let's keep it normal here.
[11075.17s -> 11075.67s]  Prison.
[11076.21s -> 11077.01s]  Sentence to prison.
[11077.57s -> 11081.81s]  That'll be balanced.
[11084.18s -> 11084.66s]  I quit.
[11084.66s -> 11085.16s]  I quit.
[11086.18s -> 11086.68s]  No.
[11089.52s -> 11091.44s]  I want to keep this balanced.
[11091.44s -> 11092.08s]  I'm a judge.
[11092.80s -> 11097.90s]  I'm a judge.
[11098.62s -> 11101.36s]  I don't acquit somebody
[11101.36s -> 11103.04s]  because somebody in Twitch chat yelled at me
[11103.04s -> 11104.48s]  to like turn around and pick up the item.
[11104.48s -> 11105.44s]  Actually, I do that all the time.
[11109.30s -> 11111.46s]  We've changed entire game sessions
[11111.46s -> 11113.62s]  based on what like three people have said in chat before.
[11113.62s -> 11118.82s]  So I sentence Citizen Glaude Garnier to prison.
[11119.54s -> 11120.82s]  Lead the condemned out.
[11121.87s -> 11122.37s]  What?
[11124.69s -> 11126.05s]  Check, check, check.
[11126.05s -> 11126.55s]  Good job.
[11127.94s -> 11128.98s]  Reputation and influence.
[11134.78s -> 11135.28s]  What?
[11135.74s -> 11139.25s]  Good work.
[11139.97s -> 11143.38s]  So I notice when I like beat that guy up
[11143.38s -> 11144.66s]  and like sent thugs to his house,
[11144.66s -> 11145.78s]  no one's done anything since.
[11149.52s -> 11150.24s]  Hold on.
[11150.24s -> 11168.98s]  Okay.
[11168.98s -> 11170.42s]  That was a big juicy one.
[11170.42s -> 11173.36s]  I can feel that one down here.
[11173.36s -> 11178.86s]  Oh, I wasn't muted.
[11178.86s -> 11180.38s]  I went to be muted when I said that.
[11180.38s -> 11180.78s]  Fuck.
[11180.78s -> 11182.14s]  It caught embarrassing.
[11182.14s -> 11182.64s]  What?
[11183.18s -> 11184.22s]  Like a hot mic.
[11184.94s -> 11189.15s]  Your wife told me that I seek the support of just people.
[11189.15s -> 11192.90s]  I should look for them in your house.
[11192.90s -> 11194.18s]  Yes, Citizen Hanria.
[11194.18s -> 11195.54s]  My husband will be more than happy
[11195.54s -> 11199.38s]  to endorse your candidacy for the post of commander in Captain Crunch.
[11200.85s -> 11203.49s]  Why does this feel like a fait accompli?
[11204.13s -> 11208.59s]  Please do not be angry at your wife.
[11208.59s -> 11211.63s]  I am sure that they acted in good faith when she made those promises.
[11211.63s -> 11215.86s]  How could anyone refuse to support such a respectable officer?
[11216.42s -> 11219.86s]  I'm certain that my husband will acknowledge your merits just as I have.
[11221.87s -> 11223.07s]  Undoubtedly.
[11223.07s -> 11225.95s]  But how can I be so sure when there are so many other candidates?
[11227.57s -> 11229.01s]  Well, I respect the other candidates.
[11229.01s -> 11230.05s]  They are decent people.
[11230.05s -> 11232.45s]  However, I can offer you the most precious gift.
[11233.33s -> 11233.73s]  Money.
[11234.29s -> 11236.29s]  Working together, we can greatly benefit each other
[11236.29s -> 11240.75s]  and maybe Barry too.
[11240.75s -> 11244.51s]  Our family has a high regard for sincerity and loyalty, does it not, my dear?
[11244.51s -> 11248.62s]  Moreover, we respect each other's boundaries.
[11248.62s -> 11249.34s]  At every turn.
[11251.52s -> 11255.68s]  Yes, sir, those ugly rumours about you being an addict should be put to an end.
[11255.68s -> 11260.26s]  Nor that I never forget those who have done me a favour.
[11260.26s -> 11261.94s]  Words, words, words.
[11261.94s -> 11264.88s]  A lot of words, Citizen Hanria.
[11264.88s -> 11268.16s]  I am certain that no other candidate has asked for your endorsement.
[11268.16s -> 11270.90s]  They do not think that you are worthy of their friendship.
[11270.90s -> 11274.10s]  But I, Francois Henry, am different.
[11274.10s -> 11275.78s]  And so are my words.
[11276.42s -> 11279.89s]  I am sure that my husband has already noticed that.
[11280.82s -> 11282.40s]  Thank you.
[11282.40s -> 11284.16s]  Regardless of what the masses are yelling,
[11284.16s -> 11286.96s]  Paris is only as strong as its united elites.
[11286.96s -> 11289.82s]  I will not retract my wife's promises.
[11289.82s -> 11292.54s]  But in the future, make sure you come to me first.
[11292.54s -> 11293.55s]  But of course.
[11297.63s -> 11299.23s]  Words, words, words.
[11304.08s -> 11305.44s]  Okay, I need to hang out.
[11306.48s -> 11307.20s]  Okay.
[11307.20s -> 11309.46s]  But now I need to learn how to deal with stage fright
[11309.46s -> 11310.82s]  if he wants to be a professional musician.
[11310.82s -> 11316.37s]  You will have to endure an hour of racket.
[11316.37s -> 11317.81s]  Opening night at the theatre sounds fun.
[11318.37s -> 11330.98s]  But the wife is happy though, right?
[11330.98s -> 11331.22s]  Yes.
[11336.26s -> 11337.14s]  You don't like that?
[11337.14s -> 11338.50s]  I thought you wanted to be a musician.
[11340.48s -> 11344.72s]  Oh, is that like me?
[11344.72s -> 11345.52s]  Is that yours?
[11345.52s -> 11346.32s]  Is that my head?
[11346.96s -> 11350.80s]  Decapitation still had not lost its charm since the beginning of the revolution.
[11350.80s -> 11354.96s]  A group of people were gathered in a Parisian street surrounding something on the floor.
[11354.96s -> 11358.40s]  Your prestigious position allowed you to make your way to the centre of the mob,
[11358.40s -> 11360.64s]  only to find a man's severed head.
[11361.60s -> 11364.64s]  What had caught everyone's attention was that the head's facial expression,
[11365.20s -> 11366.16s]  it was grinning.
[11366.80s -> 11371.36s]  It was so unusual that the crowd stared hypnotized for no apparent reason.
[11371.36s -> 11374.40s]  You wonder if anyone had thought to ask about the rest of the corpse.
[11374.40s -> 11377.36s]  A lone severed head should deftly cause curiosity,
[11377.36s -> 11380.16s]  even if for purely scientific reasons.
[11380.16s -> 11382.72s]  And now you're staring alongside everybody else.
[11385.63s -> 11386.83s]  Order the guard to get rid of the head.
[11387.63s -> 11389.73s]  Leave scratching your own head.
[11389.73s -> 11395.57s]  No, get that fucking thing out of here.
[11397.20s -> 11401.70s]  Come on, the smiling head was removed and people dispersed.
[11401.70s -> 11402.34s]  That's Paris.
[11403.87s -> 11407.15s]  Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely fucking ridiculous.
[11407.15s -> 11408.19s]  I don't want that on the street.
[11413.07s -> 11414.11s]  I'm gonna get booed for that.
[11419.15s -> 11420.67s]  A paris of a new era.
[11425.34s -> 11427.26s]  Weak, vulnerable to attacks.
[11431.42s -> 11433.02s]  Waiting for someone to reach for power.
[11437.86s -> 11441.46s]  Waiting for someone who, once again, will take control of its soul.
[11444.40s -> 11446.00s]  The pawns are now in play.
[11446.56s -> 11449.18s]  It's just like Los Santos down here.
[11450.82s -> 11452.88s]  Revolutionary holiday.
[11452.88s -> 11454.96s]  Recent days have proven that Paris can win,
[11454.96s -> 11456.00s]  that France can win.
[11456.00s -> 11457.52s]  We managed to overcome our past,
[11458.08s -> 11461.36s]  divesting our last remaining tyrant office power.
[11461.36s -> 11463.86s]  Now it's time to rebuild.
[11464.72s -> 11467.20s]  To create symbols that inspire future generations.
[11467.20s -> 11468.96s]  That is why during a gathering at the convention,
[11468.96s -> 11473.28s]  several enterprising citizens proposed the construction of a statue
[11473.28s -> 11475.84s]  to commemorate the revolutionary victory over injustice.
[11476.56s -> 11478.98s]  You were given the honor of supervising the construction.
[11479.54s -> 11483.38s]  There is no better candidate than the one who vanquished Louis Capet.
[11483.38s -> 11485.86s]  You have an opportunity to leave yet another mark on Paris.
[11485.86s -> 11487.70s]  Do I get to say what it looks like?
[11488.50s -> 11493.06s]  Can you not speak these common words?
[11494.90s -> 11496.66s]  I'm trying not to cough in the middle of them.
[11499.62s -> 11500.26s]  Like I just did.
[11500.98s -> 11504.10s]  Each section can be controlled by you, by an enemy, or by a neutral.
[11504.66s -> 11507.54s]  They're opening up a game, a board game now?
[11511.89s -> 11512.29s]  All right.
[11513.36s -> 11516.96s]  Each section you take over provides you with one additional influence point.
[11516.96s -> 11519.76s]  The chance of mission success is higher in your territory.
[11522.27s -> 11524.83s]  Enemy agents can also take over your sections.
[11525.63s -> 11528.75s]  Actions performed in enemy sections are less likely to be successful.
[11530.24s -> 11531.52s]  Some sections are locked.
[11531.52s -> 11534.24s]  I'll lock them with any agent to carry out actions without them.
[11534.88s -> 11537.92s]  To unlock a section, you have to scout it first.
[11538.56s -> 11540.40s]  You can only unlock sections adjacent to the ones
[11540.40s -> 11542.48s]  that you already have unlocked.
[11547.20s -> 11548.00s]  A fervor.
[11548.56s -> 11551.36s]  Each section reacts to the situation in the game,
[11552.30s -> 11555.10s]  causing the fervor of residents to rise or fall.
[11555.10s -> 11558.06s]  If the fervor becomes too intense, it could result in destructive riots.
[11560.02s -> 11560.42s]  Geez.
[11561.68s -> 11562.80s]  So I have agents here.
[11563.66s -> 11567.66s]  Send agents on missions, manage unruly crowds, and fight for influence over the city.
[11569.10s -> 11571.50s]  Click an agent and choose the action you wish them to carry out.
[11572.61s -> 11576.61s]  The bruiser is good at fighting and gaining reputation and managing crowds,
[11576.61s -> 11578.29s]  while the diplomat takes over sections,
[11578.29s -> 11581.17s]  nurtures relations with factions, and lowers fervor in sections.
[11581.89s -> 11583.65s]  Weaker in duels against enemy agents.
[11585.62s -> 11587.14s]  This has opened up a whole new game here.
[11588.40s -> 11590.96s]  You can move your agents freely between your sections.
[11590.96s -> 11593.04s]  Unfortunately, in hostile or neutral sections,
[11593.04s -> 11595.20s]  they can only move one space per day.
[11597.42s -> 11598.54s]  So this is controlled by me.
[11608.08s -> 11611.36s]  So does the red faction the people?
[11611.36s -> 11612.32s]  Attitude neutral.
[11616.83s -> 11618.67s]  Lower the crowds fervor in the section.
[11620.72s -> 11622.24s]  District fully upgraded.
[11624.11s -> 11625.39s]  Can I move here?
[11625.39s -> 11627.95s]  I'm going to send a diplomat to the people.
[11630.42s -> 11632.02s]  Lower the crowds fervor.
[11632.02s -> 11633.94s]  Increase your influence over the district.
[11634.50s -> 11638.05s]  And what about down here?
[11642.83s -> 11644.11s]  Take over an enemy section.
[11648.03s -> 11650.35s]  Raphael Clovis is unlocking a section.
[11651.47s -> 11651.79s]  Okay.
[11658.99s -> 11661.23s]  There's a lot going on here.
[11661.23s -> 11662.27s]  I still haven't moved up?
[11662.27s -> 11662.91s]  What happened to you?
[11665.02s -> 11665.58s]  Did he die?
[11668.21s -> 11668.53s]  Fell?
[11668.53s -> 11669.25s]  Oh, that was the...
[11669.25s -> 11670.53s]  Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[11671.82s -> 11673.10s]  I can't move up a slot here?
[11674.82s -> 11676.50s]  Oh, we got two new people.
[11676.50s -> 11683.46s]  This is not the guy that I just sent out.
[11683.46s -> 11684.18s]  He's not...
[11684.18s -> 11684.90s]  No, no, no, no.
[11684.90s -> 11686.02s]  You guys, this is the...
[11686.02s -> 11689.90s]  He's not dead.
[11689.90s -> 11690.54s]  Is that guy dead?
[11692.77s -> 11696.34s]  No.
[11696.34s -> 11697.14s]  All right.
[11697.14s -> 11698.10s]  This is the main section.
[11698.74s -> 11699.97s]  Let's go back here.
[11700.77s -> 11701.57s]  Wait.
[11701.57s -> 11703.18s]  I have something here.
[11704.30s -> 11719.68s]  There's nothing in there?
[11719.68s -> 11722.13s]  What the fuck?
[11722.13s -> 11723.57s]  The more sections under your control,
[11723.57s -> 11725.65s]  the faster the monument is constructed.
[11726.83s -> 11728.43s]  Each subsequent stage of completion
[11728.43s -> 11729.87s]  allows you to take over another building
[11729.87s -> 11730.83s]  near the monument.
[11734.27s -> 11740.32s]  Uh, I mean, I have to do the...
[11740.32s -> 11740.80s]  Look at me!
[11741.52s -> 11760.24s]  I like that pedestal.
[11760.24s -> 11761.20s]  I don't like that pedestal.
[11763.33s -> 11764.37s]  No, that's fine.
[11764.37s -> 11764.85s]  That's good.
[11770.32s -> 11772.32s]  Why is the judge commissioning statues?
[11773.90s -> 11774.78s]  Yeah, it's almost like they added
[11774.78s -> 11779.97s]  another video game here.
[11779.97s -> 11781.01s]  Each building lets you perform
[11781.01s -> 11781.81s]  a different kind of action.
[11781.81s -> 11782.45s]  Take over the ones
[11782.45s -> 11783.97s]  that support your play style.
[11784.61s -> 11790.16s]  Whenever you finish a stage of construction,
[11790.16s -> 11791.92s]  you'll be able to seize another building.
[11791.92s -> 11793.52s]  Why am I seizing my own residence?
[11794.16s -> 11801.60s]  Spend more time with your family
[11802.62s -> 11804.78s]  or facilitate the persuasions.
[11806.46s -> 11807.18s]  I need points.
[11809.92s -> 11811.04s]  I only have one influence point.
[11815.47s -> 11816.43s]  I don't think I can do anything now.
[11816.99s -> 11829.73s]  How do I get back to the judge game?
[11835.70s -> 11838.16s]  End of the day.
[11838.16s -> 11839.84s]  You're gonna unlock the battle royale mode
[11839.84s -> 11840.32s]  in 10 days?
[11841.36s -> 11842.16s]  There's a lot of stuff.
[11842.80s -> 11848.42s]  Yeah, this game just came out today,
[11848.42s -> 11849.38s]  by the way, if you're curious.
[11849.38s -> 11850.26s]  A bloody beginning.
[11850.98s -> 11852.10s]  A violent prologue
[11852.10s -> 11854.34s]  announced by a flowing red curtain.
[11854.34s -> 11859.04s]  The wrath of strangers
[11859.04s -> 11860.40s]  made me sick to my stomach.
[11861.36s -> 11862.96s]  Feet stirred dark puddles.
[11863.76s -> 11865.76s]  The air tasted like iron.
[11866.78s -> 11868.30s]  Their heads, someone cried.
[11871.17s -> 11872.53s]  Anger hidden in the shadows.
[11873.33s -> 11875.33s]  Thousands of cries from a single throat.
[11876.13s -> 11876.93s]  Here was a beast
[11876.93s -> 11878.53s]  with hundreds of claws and teeth.
[11879.09s -> 11880.05s]  What, was that a monster?
[11881.01s -> 11885.30s]  A kicked, abused,
[11885.30s -> 11886.66s]  and physically wounded soul.
[11888.34s -> 11888.90s]  Their heads.
[11889.70s -> 11891.54s]  What a cold and urgent order.
[11892.26s -> 11893.46s]  The beast's eyes
[11893.46s -> 11895.22s]  showed a long disguised bitterness.
[11895.86s -> 11896.82s]  Yesterday's envy.
[11900.88s -> 11902.08s]  It has waited too long
[11902.08s -> 11903.04s]  to show mercy now.
[11904.00s -> 11905.52s]  Too long covering its ears
[11905.52s -> 11906.56s]  while others laughed
[11906.56s -> 11908.32s]  at its inadequacies and feebleness.
[11913.31s -> 11915.31s]  The beast's bark was filled
[11915.31s -> 11917.07s]  with a thousand smiles
[11917.07s -> 11919.15s]  of those who worshiped this bloody moment.
[11920.27s -> 11922.51s]  The day when their enemies will perish.
[11922.51s -> 11923.71s]  Is this a metaphor?
[11925.15s -> 11925.79s]  They're brothers.
[11932.02s -> 11932.42s]  You think?
[11936.10s -> 11938.50s]  It's just dogs attacking each other.
[11941.06s -> 11941.86s]  This is murder.
[11945.76s -> 11946.88s]  It's all literal.
[11948.99s -> 11949.87s]  All right, so let me,
[11949.87s -> 11950.75s]  oh, let me look at this.
[11956.16s -> 11958.22s]  Let's see.
[11959.94s -> 11961.54s]  Bruno Hugo, 26,
[11961.54s -> 11963.86s]  is a groom working for the wealthy
[11963.86s -> 11965.38s]  and influential aristocrat
[11965.38s -> 11967.38s]  Jean-Claude de Jacquemart.
[11968.10s -> 11968.82s]  During a quarrel,
[11968.82s -> 11970.66s]  he was seen to push his employer
[11970.66s -> 11971.78s]  down the stairs,
[11972.42s -> 11974.02s]  resulting in the aristocrat's death.
[11974.82s -> 11976.42s]  It is significant for the case
[11976.42s -> 11978.90s]  that due to his origin and low intellect,
[11979.54s -> 11980.74s]  Bruno Hugo is known
[11980.74s -> 11982.90s]  in the local community as a village idiot.
[11984.46s -> 11985.98s]  The witnesses testified
[11985.98s -> 11988.62s]  that Jacquemart returned from a ride
[11988.62s -> 11989.66s]  displeased with the way
[11989.66s -> 11991.18s]  Bruno had prepared his horse.
[11992.14s -> 11994.94s]  Apparently, the saddle had become so loose
[11994.94s -> 11996.70s]  that Citizen de Jacquemart
[11996.70s -> 11998.06s]  almost fell from his mount.
[11998.86s -> 12000.62s]  The victim called for Bruno
[12000.62s -> 12002.14s]  in order to scold him
[12002.14s -> 12003.10s]  and began insulting
[12003.10s -> 12005.34s]  and physically abusing the stable boy.
[12006.48s -> 12008.80s]  When acting on an impulse,
[12008.80s -> 12010.56s]  Bruno pushed his employer away.
[12011.12s -> 12012.72s]  As a result, Citizen de Jacquemart
[12012.72s -> 12014.56s]  landed at the foot of the stairs
[12014.56s -> 12015.92s]  with a twisted neck.
[12016.72s -> 12017.52s]  The incident happened
[12017.52s -> 12019.12s]  in front of other employees.
[12019.12s -> 12021.12s]  Bruno Hugo escaped to the stable
[12021.12s -> 12022.56s]  where he was later found,
[12022.56s -> 12023.44s]  pale with fright
[12023.44s -> 12024.40s]  and whispering something
[12024.40s -> 12025.28s]  to one of the horses.
[12029.74s -> 12031.10s]  A quiddle from the common folk
[12031.10s -> 12031.98s]  and from family
[12033.10s -> 12035.26s]  and prison for the revolutionaries.
[12037.66s -> 12040.53s]  So we got some info here.
[12040.53s -> 12044.26s]  Let's go ahead and start this theory.
[12045.22s -> 12049.22s]  So, twisted neck is
[12050.42s -> 12053.06s]  no, no, no, no.
[12053.06s -> 12055.70s]  The village idiot is personality.
[12059.81s -> 12062.77s]  Groom is what the witness does.
[12066.40s -> 12071.84s]  Loose saddle is the accusation.
[12080.46s -> 12082.06s]  Loose saddle, no, that's the motive.
[12082.06s -> 12083.34s]  No, it's not.
[12083.34s -> 12084.38s]  That's the method.
[12084.38s -> 12088.99s]  Uh-oh, there was no motive.
[12092.50s -> 12092.90s]  Hold on.
[12098.27s -> 12098.99s]  God damn it.
[12099.71s -> 12102.74s]  I'm going to go like Gargo with salt water.
[12102.74s -> 12111.22s]  This is starting to get really fucking annoying.
[12111.86s -> 12113.97s]  All right, return for his ride.
[12113.97s -> 12115.33s]  Okay, the witness testified that
[12116.13s -> 12117.41s]  Jacques returned from a ride,
[12117.97s -> 12119.09s]  displeased from the way
[12119.09s -> 12120.29s]  that Bruno prepared his horse.
[12121.94s -> 12123.06s]  The saddle was so loose
[12123.06s -> 12124.26s]  that he almost fell.
[12124.26s -> 12127.46s]  Okay, so that's the method.
[12128.18s -> 12130.54s]  So then we've got
[12131.10s -> 12132.14s]  return from a ride
[12133.31s -> 12134.35s]  that was a witness, right?
[12134.91s -> 12141.84s]  There's been too much learning
[12141.84s -> 12143.44s]  on these streams recently.
[12146.78s -> 12148.70s]  Shout and struggle, uh, that's
[12151.76s -> 12153.04s]  I mean, is that method?
[12153.04s -> 12154.08s]  Twisted neck is
[12154.88s -> 12157.17s]  that's not an accusation.
[12157.17s -> 12157.73s]  That's not a witness.
[12157.73s -> 12158.45s]  That's not a motive.
[12158.45s -> 12159.57s]  That's the method, right?
[12160.45s -> 12163.94s]  Like if you break your neck,
[12163.94s -> 12165.78s]  that's the method by breaking your neck
[12165.78s -> 12166.90s]  was falling down the stairs
[12167.54s -> 12170.98s]  or it could be a trap.
[12175.62s -> 12176.26s]  I don't buy that.
[12176.90s -> 12187.82s]  So he was
[12187.82s -> 12189.42s]  the victim called for Bruno to scold him
[12189.42s -> 12191.82s]  began insulting and abusing the stable boy.
[12193.54s -> 12198.02s]  So shout and struggle is the method
[12198.66s -> 12200.51s]  or the accusation.
[12204.93s -> 12206.69s]  It's method, motive, or accusation.
[12207.33s -> 12212.96s]  Okay, yeah.
[12214.37s -> 12216.69s]  Then it's only three more.
[12217.81s -> 12221.17s]  Groom is the offender's personality.
[12221.89s -> 12222.93s]  Oh, that's a trap.
[12222.93s -> 12224.05s]  How is that the trap?
[12225.55s -> 12225.79s]  What?
[12226.51s -> 12228.83s]  The twisted neck method is not the trap?
[12229.55s -> 12234.61s]  Well, that sucks.
[12235.25s -> 12240.94s]  This is a simple case.
[12240.94s -> 12242.38s]  The accused is guilty of murder
[12242.38s -> 12243.18s]  and the only problem is
[12243.18s -> 12244.70s]  that people feel sorry for him.
[12245.34s -> 12245.98s]  What's your name?
[12246.62s -> 12248.85s]  Bruno Hugo.
[12248.85s -> 12249.89s]  I'm Bruno Hugo.
[12250.93s -> 12253.17s]  Do you work for citizen Jean-Claude de Jacquemin?
[12254.40s -> 12256.08s]  Yes, I worked there for a few years.
[12256.08s -> 12256.64s]  Quite a few.
[12257.81s -> 12258.61s]  Leave him alone.
[12258.61s -> 12259.97s]  He's just a man child.
[12261.23s -> 12262.43s]  Do you admit to the murder?
[12262.43s -> 12262.99s]  Yes or no?
[12264.00s -> 12264.64s]  But I...
[12265.89s -> 12266.53s]  Poor thing.
[12266.53s -> 12267.73s]  He's shaking all over.
[12270.98s -> 12272.18s]  All right, I need three more.
[12272.18s -> 12272.90s]  I can't fuck this up.
[12273.46s -> 12275.84s]  Twisted neck.
[12275.84s -> 12276.56s]  There's no more trap.
[12277.12s -> 12280.29s]  Twisted neck is the method
[12284.24s -> 12285.52s]  that he broke his neck.
[12287.90s -> 12289.18s]  Shout and struggle is...
[12289.90s -> 12290.93s]  What?
[12290.93s -> 12293.28s]  Is another one for shout and struggle?
[12293.28s -> 12295.52s]  Return from a ride as the witness said, right?
[12295.52s -> 12296.16s]  Let me see this.
[12299.42s -> 12300.62s]  The witness has testified
[12300.62s -> 12304.72s]  that Jacques returned from a ride, right?
[12310.22s -> 12311.42s]  Village Idiot Streamer.
[12312.80s -> 12316.18s]  And then the personality of the...
[12317.46s -> 12317.70s]  Yeah.
[12318.58s -> 12319.38s]  Okay, we're good.
[12319.38s -> 12320.34s]  Because that's the personality
[12320.34s -> 12321.94s]  of the guy that was fucking strangling him.
[12323.07s -> 12323.71s]  Okay, here we go.
[12325.23s -> 12327.31s]  Do you know how local people refer to you?
[12330.00s -> 12331.20s]  Bruno does not know.
[12331.20s -> 12331.92s]  Does not know.
[12333.23s -> 12334.19s]  Village Idiot.
[12334.19s -> 12335.47s]  Do you wish to comment on this?
[12335.47s -> 12336.83s]  Why am I doing that?
[12337.39s -> 12339.55s]  Bruno does not like that name.
[12339.55s -> 12339.79s]  No.
[12340.43s -> 12342.53s]  Do they often call you that?
[12344.13s -> 12345.57s]  It's mocking him.
[12345.57s -> 12347.41s]  No, I don't like it.
[12347.41s -> 12348.05s]  And that's that.
[12348.05s -> 12348.93s]  I already have a name
[12349.57s -> 12350.69s]  given to me by my mother.
[12350.69s -> 12351.57s]  She gave me one.
[12352.62s -> 12353.66s]  What is this?
[12353.66s -> 12354.62s]  Well, is this nickname
[12354.62s -> 12357.34s]  the reason you push Citizen Jacques Le Guard
[12357.34s -> 12358.14s]  down the stairs?
[12358.86s -> 12360.40s]  The master was shouting
[12360.40s -> 12361.76s]  and I don't like it when he shouts.
[12361.76s -> 12362.48s]  I don't like it.
[12369.31s -> 12371.87s]  Uh...
[12371.87s -> 12373.79s]  Are you aware that you have killed a man?
[12373.79s -> 12374.91s]  Do you understand that?
[12376.94s -> 12377.34s]  I know.
[12377.98s -> 12379.18s]  I just swung my arm
[12379.18s -> 12380.94s]  because he was shouting at me like that.
[12380.94s -> 12382.06s]  So loud.
[12382.06s -> 12382.86s]  Wait, I thought he was...
[12385.20s -> 12386.80s]  I thought he was attacking.
[12388.54s -> 12390.14s]  Were you aware that you could hurt him?
[12391.17s -> 12391.97s]  I didn't think so.
[12391.97s -> 12392.45s]  I didn't.
[12395.06s -> 12397.22s]  Did you swing so hard that he fell down?
[12398.48s -> 12400.24s]  I got so scared I can't remember.
[12400.24s -> 12401.92s]  I squinted my eyes, sir.
[12401.92s -> 12403.12s]  And when I opened them again,
[12403.12s -> 12405.28s]  there he was lying down there downstairs.
[12411.90s -> 12413.10s]  He plead guilty.
[12415.81s -> 12417.17s]  How did Citizen Des Jacques Mar
[12417.17s -> 12417.65s]  treat you?
[12418.53s -> 12419.49s]  He was good to me.
[12419.49s -> 12420.53s]  Sometimes he shouted,
[12420.53s -> 12422.85s]  but he fed me and was good to the horses.
[12422.85s -> 12423.17s]  Good.
[12423.81s -> 12425.36s]  How often did he shout?
[12426.00s -> 12427.04s]  Sometimes he shouted.
[12427.04s -> 12427.84s]  Sometimes he didn't.
[12429.84s -> 12431.60s]  Aristocrat scoundrel.
[12432.42s -> 12434.10s]  Is that why you decided to kill him?
[12435.23s -> 12436.82s]  Uh...
[12436.82s -> 12438.58s]  First he was tormented by the nobleman
[12438.58s -> 12439.86s]  and now by the revolution.
[12440.58s -> 12444.96s]  Please call in, uh...
[12444.96s -> 12446.16s]  Please call in.
[12446.16s -> 12447.04s]  Call in.
[12447.04s -> 12447.76s]  Please call in.
[12447.76s -> 12448.32s]  Please call in.
[12448.32s -> 12448.72s]  Call in.
[12453.65s -> 12455.49s]  Please introduce yourself and state your duties.
[12457.25s -> 12458.53s]  My name is Colin Bouffieu.
[12458.53s -> 12460.53s]  I am the major domo at the residence
[12460.53s -> 12462.77s]  of the Des Jacques Mar family
[12462.77s -> 12464.05s]  and saw exactly what happened.
[12465.49s -> 12466.61s]  Please tell us what happened
[12466.61s -> 12467.57s]  between Citizen Hugo
[12467.57s -> 12469.09s]  and the master of the horses on that day.
[12469.89s -> 12470.85s]  What do you think of the groom?
[12471.49s -> 12472.13s]  Tell us what happened.
[12473.90s -> 12475.42s]  Citizen Des Jacques Mar
[12475.42s -> 12476.62s]  was furious at Bruno
[12476.62s -> 12478.54s]  because he hadn't tightened the saddle.
[12478.54s -> 12480.06s]  Could have caused an accident.
[12481.57s -> 12483.25s]  How did your employer react to this?
[12484.38s -> 12486.06s]  He started shouting at Bruno.
[12486.62s -> 12488.14s]  Tugging and pulling at him.
[12488.14s -> 12490.46s]  Bruno pushed Citizen Des Jacques Mar away
[12490.46s -> 12492.30s]  causing him to fall down the stairs
[12492.30s -> 12493.58s]  they were both standing on.
[12494.59s -> 12495.55s]  Nasty bourgeois.
[12500.02s -> 12500.98s]  Uh...
[12500.98s -> 12504.18s]  How do you plead?
[12505.06s -> 12506.42s]  I don't know what I did wrong.
[12506.42s -> 12507.14s]  I don't understand.
[12507.14s -> 12508.50s]  These people wanted me to come here
[12508.50s -> 12509.70s]  so I came.
[12509.70s -> 12511.06s]  I meant no harm to nobody.
[12511.06s -> 12511.62s]  No harm.
[12512.18s -> 12514.50s]  You're facing the death penalty
[12514.50s -> 12515.14s]  for murder.
[12515.14s -> 12516.18s]  Do you realize that?
[12516.98s -> 12517.70s]  Is he?
[12517.70s -> 12518.74s]  I'm jumping to that.
[12520.77s -> 12522.45s]  I just want to go back to the horses.
[12522.45s -> 12523.73s]  I don't know if they've eaten today.
[12523.73s -> 12525.73s]  If a horse doesn't eat for a long time
[12525.73s -> 12526.77s]  the master isn't happy
[12526.77s -> 12527.97s]  when the horses aren't fed.
[12528.53s -> 12530.85s]  Are you more worried about the horses
[12530.85s -> 12532.61s]  than your own master?
[12532.61s -> 12534.00s]  The master is dead.
[12534.00s -> 12535.04s]  What can I do?
[12535.04s -> 12536.64s]  And the horses are still alive.
[12536.64s -> 12537.36s]  They're alive.
[12555.31s -> 12567.65s]  Did the defendant confess to the crimes?
[12568.93s -> 12569.25s]  Yes.
[12570.27s -> 12572.59s]  Was his act counter-revolutionary in nature?
[12573.55s -> 12574.75s]  I mean not really.
[12575.79s -> 12577.55s]  What was the reason behind the argument
[12577.55s -> 12578.75s]  the defendant had with the victim?
[12579.31s -> 12580.35s]  A loose saddle.
[12581.71s -> 12583.79s]  Does the defendant understand the indictment?
[12584.75s -> 12584.99s]  No.
[12590.16s -> 12591.12s]  He didn't confess.
[12591.12s -> 12591.60s]  Yeah, he did.
[12591.60s -> 12593.04s]  He said like, yeah, I did it.
[12593.04s -> 12593.52s]  He's dead.
[12603.17s -> 12604.37s]  You're responsible for preparing
[12604.37s -> 12605.49s]  the horses for the victim.
[12606.29s -> 12607.49s]  Yes, I combed them and fed them.
[12607.49s -> 12608.61s]  Horses eat a lot of grass.
[12608.61s -> 12609.17s]  I combed them.
[12610.03s -> 12611.31s]  Was the saddle loose?
[12615.36s -> 12615.92s]  Hello?
[12615.92s -> 12616.32s]  Citizen?
[12617.28s -> 12618.08s]  No, impossible.
[12618.08s -> 12619.04s]  I pulled the straps.
[12619.04s -> 12620.08s]  You can't pull too hard
[12620.08s -> 12621.76s]  or it crushes and hurts the horse's stomach.
[12621.76s -> 12622.48s]  Horses are good.
[12622.48s -> 12623.60s]  Better than humans.
[12623.60s -> 12623.84s]  They...
[12625.02s -> 12626.94s]  Did you want your master to fall off the horse?
[12626.94s -> 12629.34s]  Did you deliberately leave the girth strap loose
[12629.34s -> 12630.70s]  to get back at your employer?
[12631.34s -> 12632.21s]  I never.
[12632.21s -> 12633.09s]  I liked our master.
[12633.09s -> 12633.73s]  I wouldn't hurt him.
[12633.73s -> 12634.29s]  I liked him.
[12634.93s -> 12637.25s]  You can see that he's just a gentle child.
[12637.89s -> 12643.07s]  People are aggressive.
[12649.90s -> 12650.62s]  Let him go.
[12651.50s -> 12652.46s]  Riot incoming.
[12652.46s -> 12653.26s]  I'm not a bad judge.
[12653.26s -> 12653.82s]  I just need to get there.
[12653.82s -> 12655.34s]  I got to get all the facts.
[12656.14s -> 12659.20s]  You still killed somebody.
[12659.76s -> 12668.34s]  This one makes the most sense to stay balanced.
[12673.82s -> 12675.10s]  Manslaughter, not murder.
[12680.38s -> 12682.30s]  Balance or justice.
[12689.76s -> 12691.44s]  Saddle didn't fit.
[12691.44s -> 12692.56s]  The saddle didn't fit.
[12693.44s -> 12698.19s]  Yeah, that's the best for game purposes.
[12698.19s -> 12699.55s]  That's the best option.
[12699.55s -> 12705.23s]  It's death penalty.
[12705.23s -> 12707.47s]  Can you imagine that if I had done that?
[12715.84s -> 12718.96s]  I find Bruno Hugo not guilty of the aforementioned crimes
[12718.96s -> 12720.80s]  as he is unaware of what happened.
[12721.36s -> 12722.80s]  What does it matter?
[12722.80s -> 12723.92s]  A crime is a crime.
[12725.97s -> 12727.73s]  You have to be careful with the likes of this one.
[12727.73s -> 12729.17s]  His employer should have known better.
[12733.52s -> 12739.47s]  Good job.
[12739.47s -> 12740.19s]  Bad judge.
[12740.19s -> 12740.91s]  I didn't get bad judge.
[12740.91s -> 12741.87s]  I got influence points.
[12744.59s -> 12745.47s]  I got to get some more water.
[12749.82s -> 12751.58s]  My name is Jean-Marie Rowland
[12751.58s -> 12753.18s]  and my name should not be unknown to you.
[12753.18s -> 12755.10s]  After all, you wiped your shoes on it
[12755.10s -> 12756.62s]  during King Louis' trial.
[12764.21s -> 12766.05s]  Citizen's cafe, not King.
[12768.48s -> 12770.00s]  King Louis Auguste Babin.
[12772.88s -> 12775.04s]  Thanks to you flinging around half-truths
[12775.04s -> 12776.00s]  and speculation.
[12776.80s -> 12778.48s]  Everyone is calling for my head.
[12779.12s -> 12781.12s]  Accusing me of corruption and treason
[12781.12s -> 12783.28s]  while you used our backs as a stepladder
[12783.28s -> 12785.60s]  on your way up the social hierarchy.
[12785.60s -> 12788.74s]  Corrupting politicians does not always work out.
[12789.87s -> 12790.99s]  Danton does it.
[12790.99s -> 12792.27s]  Melville tried to.
[12792.27s -> 12793.31s]  But they caught you.
[12793.87s -> 12794.35s]  Happens.
[12795.23s -> 12798.08s]  I will probably be dismissed from my station.
[12798.80s -> 12800.64s]  I may even end up at the guillotine.
[12801.28s -> 12804.08s]  But I will make sure your head rolls right after mine.
[12804.96s -> 12808.80s]  You will be my comrade in misery.
[12809.76s -> 12811.66s]  Threatening the judge of the tribunal
[12811.66s -> 12813.98s]  is an even worse idea than supporting a despised king
[12813.98s -> 12815.42s]  and corrupting politicians of the convention.
[12818.18s -> 12821.86s]  I will get rid of you, a candidate for captain of the guard.
[12821.86s -> 12824.03s]  And then I will go after you.
[12824.83s -> 12828.50s]  It took me and my wife too long to get used to where we are.
[12829.14s -> 12833.44s]  I will not die because of some over-boozed maggot
[12833.44s -> 12835.68s]  that likes to call himself a judge.
[12837.04s -> 12839.84s]  You will see how we wage war in Paris' salons.
[12840.48s -> 12853.70s]  You treacherous mongrel.
[12853.78s -> 12856.58s]  Dear comrade, I heard the news of Minister Roland's unexpected visit.
[12858.16s -> 12860.72s]  I have to confess that Roland knows about me
[12860.72s -> 12862.24s]  something that he should not have.
[12863.87s -> 12866.35s]  I am certain he is already weaving an intrigue against us.
[12866.35s -> 12868.27s]  We have to start working on one against him.
[12869.25s -> 12873.87s]  Francois.
[12873.87s -> 12875.63s]  Play something for me, son.
[12875.63s -> 12876.75s]  No, that's the wrong voice.
[12876.75s -> 12877.23s]  Wrong guy.
[12877.79s -> 12879.15s]  I have work to do.
[12879.15s -> 12880.35s]  What if we just...
[12880.35s -> 12881.39s]  Everyone gets the same voice.
[12881.39s -> 12882.19s]  Don't you guys understand?
[12882.75s -> 12884.11s]  As you wish, father.
[12884.11s -> 12895.22s]  Support the construction of the statue.
[12895.86s -> 12901.92s]  Increase the rate at which the statue is constructed.
[12901.92s -> 12902.48s]  Who cares?
[12903.74s -> 12905.02s]  Opening night of the theater.
[12905.02s -> 12907.10s]  No, I think dad's got to get happy here.
[12907.10s -> 12907.74s]  Reading together.
[12908.46s -> 12912.06s]  Yeah.
[12912.06s -> 12913.26s]  Dad will think this is interesting.
[12919.07s -> 12921.57s]  Wow, mom really liked that.
[12922.37s -> 12922.87s]  A lot.
[12923.49s -> 12925.57s]  We must get four altis.
[12929.79s -> 12934.10s]  Ooh, what happened?
[12934.10s -> 12934.60s]  Ooh.
[12935.79s -> 12937.55s]  Ooh, unlocked.
[12937.55s -> 12938.05s]  Uh-oh.
[12938.67s -> 12941.86s]  Enemy agents will fight with your agents for territory.
[12941.86s -> 12944.58s]  They can take over your sections with neutral sections.
[12945.87s -> 12946.67s]  This combat.
[12947.39s -> 12950.35s]  When at least two hostile agents meet in one section,
[12951.07s -> 12952.27s]  combat ensues.
[12953.07s -> 12956.11s]  Remember that a diplomat has little chance against a brutal fighter.
[12957.86s -> 12960.58s]  After defeating combat, your agent becomes injured.
[12961.38s -> 12964.02s]  They can still move around, but are not able to perform any actions.
[12965.14s -> 12966.58s]  Your main section is vital.
[12967.14s -> 12970.34s]  The buildings here enable you to influence the rest of the game.
[12970.34s -> 12972.10s]  Protect it at all costs.
[12972.10s -> 12974.50s]  If you let it out of your grasp, you will lose the game.
[12977.18s -> 12977.90s]  I'm sorry, I didn't mute.
[12978.94s -> 12979.88s]  Okay.
[12981.71s -> 12986.69s]  Go fucking get them.
[12986.77s -> 12987.97s]  Fighting. This is a diplomat, right?
[12994.82s -> 12995.62s]  Revolutionaries.
[12996.26s -> 12999.28s]  Construction of the monument, okay.
[12999.28s -> 13001.04s]  Why does the judge have his own militia?
[13001.04s -> 13001.76s]  What's down here?
[13002.32s -> 13005.34s]  Let's go take a look.
[13006.14s -> 13007.82s]  Unlock this section too.
[13008.38s -> 13013.94s]  Now, this is a captain versus a diplomat.
[13014.58s -> 13018.75s]  This guy's going to be coming out of the library with a bunch of books in his hand,
[13018.75s -> 13021.23s]  and this guy's going to just walk over and shoulder-attack them,
[13021.23s -> 13023.55s]  and he's going to go like, oh-ho, and fall backwards.
[13024.11s -> 13027.66s]  I'll see to this that you hang, and he's going to run away.
[13031.47s -> 13032.27s]  Easy.
[13032.27s -> 13037.90s]  Okay, so that's good.
[13038.70s -> 13039.20s]  Intrigue.
[13041.81s -> 13044.79s]  Well, there's more.
[13045.51s -> 13050.23s]  The documents discovered in Capay's iron cabinet raise suspicions regarding Roland.
[13050.87s -> 13054.55s]  The minister hates the tribunal for openly ridiculing him,
[13054.55s -> 13056.47s]  and he will not forgive you for it.
[13056.47s -> 13059.19s]  His intelligent wife holds an even stronger grudge.
[13060.55s -> 13061.91s]  Number of successes.
[13061.91s -> 13063.11s]  Three number of successes.
[13063.11s -> 13063.61s]  Five.
[13067.68s -> 13068.56s]  Action blocks.
[13069.20s -> 13073.81s]  Perform actions correctly to fill the progress bar.
[13075.24s -> 13077.40s]  If you carry out too few, you will lose.
[13077.40s -> 13080.20s]  If you perform more than necessary, you will receive a bonus.
[13081.80s -> 13083.88s]  Perform actions correctly to fill the progress bar.
[13083.88s -> 13085.16s]  If you carry out too few, you will win.
[13085.16s -> 13085.66s]  Okay.
[13089.01s -> 13090.36s]  The documents.
[13092.36s -> 13093.56s]  Successful intrigue.
[13093.56s -> 13097.27s]  So, convincing a witness.
[13097.27s -> 13100.15s]  So far, there are only rumors that Roland destroyed the documents.
[13100.15s -> 13103.35s]  If we find someone from his social circle to corroborate this,
[13103.35s -> 13104.79s]  we would gain a powerful tool.
[13105.43s -> 13108.23s]  We have a potential candidate, Philip Cotet,
[13108.23s -> 13111.67s]  who was among the people who opened Capay's iron cabinet.
[13112.39s -> 13116.08s]  For an action to be successful,
[13116.08s -> 13118.32s]  you need to persuade the required number of people.
[13119.12s -> 13121.76s]  You can also send your diplomat to do it for you.
[13121.76s -> 13124.00s]  Remember, you can only do this while the block is active.
[13127.28s -> 13137.18s]  All right.
[13138.04s -> 13138.76s]  So you can send it.
[13138.76s -> 13139.56s]  It's two points.
[13139.56s -> 13140.60s]  I only have like three points.
[13143.83s -> 13144.55s]  What if I do it?
[13144.55s -> 13145.05s]  Convince.
[13145.67s -> 13147.22s]  Can I do this?
[13148.52s -> 13150.20s]  Is it like a certain chance that I...
[13152.79s -> 13153.27s]  Oh, shit.
[13153.27s -> 13155.59s]  We have a string of dialogue?
[13156.15s -> 13157.43s]  Thank you for coming, Citizen Cotet.
[13157.99s -> 13161.67s]  How could I say no to a person who holds the lives of kings in the palm of his hand?
[13162.23s -> 13164.88s]  I presume that our meeting is connected to Minister Roland?
[13165.44s -> 13166.50s]  Exactly.
[13167.28s -> 13169.52s]  I'd like to talk about the incident with the iron cabinet.
[13170.08s -> 13171.99s]  It is indeed rather ugly.
[13171.99s -> 13174.39s]  The minister could lose his head because of it,
[13174.39s -> 13176.47s]  although it is currently nothing more than gossip.
[13177.94s -> 13181.46s]  Yes, but what if the gossip suddenly turned into the truth?
[13182.48s -> 13184.24s]  Then things would certainly get nasty.
[13184.88s -> 13187.46s]  I want to get him.
[13187.46s -> 13189.08s]  What are you going to do to help me?
[13189.08s -> 13189.88s]  Carrots and sticks.
[13190.60s -> 13191.64s]  All right, withdrawn.
[13191.64s -> 13192.52s]  I want to get Roland.
[13192.52s -> 13193.02s]  Aggressive.
[13195.62s -> 13196.74s]  What will he get out of this?
[13197.56s -> 13198.20s]  Manipulate.
[13199.51s -> 13200.31s]  Carrot and stick.
[13201.40s -> 13202.04s]  Carelessness.
[13203.28s -> 13203.84s]  Bingo.
[13203.84s -> 13204.48s]  Bingo.
[13204.48s -> 13204.98s]  Bingo.
[13205.78s -> 13209.51s]  Fuck.
[13209.51s -> 13211.03s]  No, that was right, except for this.
[13214.63s -> 13215.43s]  So I think it's...
[13216.07s -> 13216.39s]  That's...
[13216.39s -> 13217.19s]  This is not perfect.
[13218.79s -> 13220.55s]  These are both good, but neither one of them is perfect.
[13223.80s -> 13226.52s]  Manipulate would be perfect, but this one's not perfect.
[13226.52s -> 13227.64s]  What will he get out of this?
[13228.36s -> 13232.13s]  Maybe carelessness for this one?
[13235.51s -> 13237.27s]  Will strong, strong, and perfect.
[13237.51s -> 13239.19s]  We're strong, strong, strong, convinced.
[13244.76s -> 13245.48s]  I wonder.
[13245.48s -> 13247.97s]  Or humility.
[13247.97s -> 13250.45s]  I'm going to do aggression, manipulation, and humility.
[13250.45s -> 13256.63s]  Here we go.
[13256.63s -> 13259.46s]  I need Roland's head.
[13259.46s -> 13260.34s]  He is a pest.
[13260.34s -> 13262.74s]  By bribing politicians, he has harmed all of France.
[13263.89s -> 13265.97s]  We need the witness that saw him opening the iron chest
[13265.97s -> 13267.09s]  to reveal his identity.
[13267.09s -> 13267.89s]  We need you.
[13268.53s -> 13269.17s]  Sibyzen.
[13270.60s -> 13271.96s]  Roland has his vices,
[13271.96s -> 13274.28s]  but are they enough to justify my betrayal
[13274.28s -> 13276.28s]  because that is what you ask of me?
[13278.21s -> 13279.33s]  Manipulation.
[13279.33s -> 13284.16s]  Minister Roland will not save you
[13284.16s -> 13285.52s]  when matters become troublesome.
[13285.52s -> 13288.08s]  I can save you from charges of complicity,
[13288.08s -> 13289.44s]  for example, other things.
[13290.56s -> 13293.43s]  All right, and then humility.
[13293.99s -> 13298.47s]  I believe that you are a man of reason, Citizen Coat.
[13298.47s -> 13300.31s]  Listening to it, telling you that you do not want
[13300.31s -> 13301.67s]  to pay for Roland's mistakes,
[13302.23s -> 13304.07s]  and I do not want to make you pay for them.
[13305.12s -> 13307.28s]  Got it.
[13307.28s -> 13309.20s]  I will help you and testify against him.
[13309.76s -> 13311.20s]  Let us see where this leads.
[13311.20s -> 13312.32s]  But hopefully to you,
[13312.88s -> 13315.04s]  hopefully to my head staying on my neck,
[13315.04s -> 13315.84s]  as you promised.
[13322.37s -> 13323.09s]  Got it.
[13323.09s -> 13329.70s]  Thank you.
[13329.70s -> 13331.06s]  Oh, God, spreading rumors.
[13332.23s -> 13334.07s]  Choosing how to resolve this.
[13334.07s -> 13336.31s]  Some actors require you to make decisions about tactics.
[13336.31s -> 13338.39s]  Each decision may have a different chance of success.
[13343.19s -> 13344.31s]  What is this one?
[13344.31s -> 13348.45s]  Courtguard Raphael Clovis,
[13348.45s -> 13349.33s]  your loyal subordinate,
[13349.33s -> 13351.57s]  will have to talk some sense into a few heads
[13351.57s -> 13353.41s]  so they realize how big a threat Roland is.
[13354.05s -> 13357.41s]  Or a few casual remarks made by the respected Jacques-Louis David
[13357.41s -> 13358.69s]  should unleash an avalanche.
[13361.91s -> 13363.11s]  Chance of success is 10%.
[13363.99s -> 13365.99s]  Or plus 10%.
[13366.87s -> 13368.37s]  Does that not get-
[13368.37s -> 13369.17s]  That's not gonna-
[13369.17s -> 13370.29s]  10% chance?
[13373.12s -> 13374.64s]  Or is that added on top?
[13379.57s -> 13381.40s]  I don't think it's worth doing.
[13384.84s -> 13386.60s]  We'll do, ah, diplomacy.
[13388.76s -> 13390.52s]  Intrigues are carried out in a matter of days.
[13390.52s -> 13391.80s]  The results of some action blocks
[13391.80s -> 13393.40s]  may only be seen the next day.
[13394.12s -> 13395.65s]  So that's plus 10%, okay?
[13396.37s -> 13401.11s]  Okay.
[13401.11s -> 13402.31s]  How is that a failed intrigue?
[13402.95s -> 13404.13s]  I think we're good.
[13404.85s -> 13407.92s]  Added from the one before, okay?
[13407.92s -> 13408.80s]  What happened here?
[13408.80s -> 13409.20s]  They're just-
[13409.20s -> 13409.68s]  They're fighting.
[13410.48s -> 13411.52s]  All right, we'll end the day.
[13413.83s -> 13424.68s]  It's a cool game, it is.
[13426.44s -> 13427.80s]  All right, here we go.
[13427.80s -> 13430.04s]  Revolutionaries want the death penalty,
[13430.76s -> 13432.82s]  and common folk want acquittal.
[13433.54s -> 13436.56s]  He fell in love with Marie Antoinette.
[13437.28s -> 13439.76s]  Are you Mr. Antoine Barnet?
[13443.27s -> 13443.67s]  I am.
[13445.00s -> 13447.00s]  Did you and your mistress Marie Antoinette
[13447.00s -> 13447.96s]  plot against France?
[13449.43s -> 13450.87s]  There are so many lies in your-
[13450.87s -> 13451.51s]  No, wait, wrong.
[13453.75s -> 13455.43s]  There are so many lies in your question
[13455.43s -> 13457.35s]  that I cannot decide which one to deny first.
[13458.82s -> 13461.14s]  He tries to defend himself with pretty words.
[13462.56s -> 13463.92s]  So are you not pleading guilty?
[13464.64s -> 13465.91s]  Of course not.
[13468.66s -> 13469.86s]  All we got here, we've got-
[13471.16s -> 13473.56s]  Your Highness, I am certain that our shared efforts
[13473.56s -> 13475.08s]  will convince the people of France
[13475.08s -> 13476.28s]  to preserve the monarchy.
[13477.00s -> 13479.16s]  The loss of your wisdom and kindness
[13479.16s -> 13480.60s]  would be too tragic a blow
[13480.60s -> 13483.16s]  for the state to afford yours, Antoine.
[13483.16s -> 13484.28s]  What else do we have here?
[13484.28s -> 13485.32s]  We have this case file.
[13489.19s -> 13491.11s]  Treason, advocating monarchy,
[13491.11s -> 13492.47s]  and counterrevolution.
[13497.80s -> 13513.40s]  Defendant is Antoine Barnet, a 32-year-old politician
[13513.40s -> 13515.24s]  and famous orator.
[13516.24s -> 13519.36s]  Parisians remember him from his fiery speech
[13519.36s -> 13526.63s]  defending the constitutional monarchy.
[13526.63s -> 13528.47s]  He is known as a fierce enemy of the republic
[13528.47s -> 13529.51s]  and protector of the king.
[13530.07s -> 13531.43s]  Seeing that his political efforts
[13531.43s -> 13533.43s]  were fruitless, he joined the National Guard.
[13534.23s -> 13534.79s]  Excuse me.
[13542.02s -> 13545.94s]  In 1791, during the notorious flight to Varans,
[13546.58s -> 13548.42s]  the Capets were detained by the Guard.
[13549.06s -> 13550.98s]  Antoine Barnet and two of the soldiers
[13550.98s -> 13553.54s]  were ordered to escort the fugitives back to Paris.
[13555.67s -> 13557.83s]  When Barnet met Marie Antoinette,
[13557.83s -> 13559.59s]  he was absolutely charmed.
[13560.31s -> 13562.39s]  The two developed a potentially sexual,
[13562.39s -> 13564.31s]  potentially sexual relationship.
[13565.19s -> 13567.27s]  Later, they were frequently writing to each other.
[13567.83s -> 13570.23s]  In her letters, Marie Antoinette often expressed
[13570.23s -> 13572.39s]  hope for the survival of absolute monarchy.
[13573.91s -> 13577.03s]  Not long after, Barnet joined the Jacobins,
[13577.03s -> 13578.23s]  hoping to help the Capets
[13578.23s -> 13579.43s]  and alleviate the radical approach
[13579.43s -> 13580.31s]  of the revolutionaries
[13580.31s -> 13582.15s]  towards Citizen Capet and Marie Antoinette.
[13582.95s -> 13585.19s]  His efforts, however, were futile.
[13585.91s -> 13587.67s]  Due to his sympathy towards the monarchy
[13587.67s -> 13590.47s]  and the Capets, especially Marie Antoinette,
[13590.47s -> 13592.15s]  he was under constant surveillance.
[13592.87s -> 13595.11s]  Now we have finally managed to collect enough evidence
[13595.11s -> 13596.87s]  against him to file an indictment.
[13597.51s -> 13599.03s]  One of the pieces of evidence is
[13599.03s -> 13601.59s]  his correspondence with Marie Antoinette,
[13601.59s -> 13602.63s]  which potentially proves
[13602.63s -> 13604.31s]  his counter-revolutionary tendencies.
[13605.11s -> 13607.59s]  Antoine Barnet ought to be punished
[13607.59s -> 13609.19s]  like any other enemy of the revolution.
[13609.91s -> 13611.27s]  And the evidence is a letter
[13611.27s -> 13612.87s]  Barnet wrote to Marie Antoinette.
[13613.99s -> 13616.63s]  Okay, so, famous orator.
[13619.99s -> 13622.55s]  Ordered to escort the fugitives back to Paris.
[13624.02s -> 13627.46s]  Okay, met Marie Antoinette,
[13627.46s -> 13629.78s]  was absolutely charmed.
[13629.78s -> 13631.06s]  They developed a relationship.
[13631.06s -> 13632.34s]  They write back and forth.
[13633.22s -> 13635.30s]  Had some sympathy towards the monarchy
[13636.12s -> 13637.08s]  and wrote some letters.
[13639.70s -> 13642.26s]  Okay, so, famous orator.
[13642.26s -> 13644.12s]  That's a personality.
[13644.12s -> 13645.88s]  We have letters addressed to Marie Antoinette.
[13647.40s -> 13648.04s]  That's evidence.
[13648.68s -> 13649.96s]  Sympathy towards the monarchs.
[13651.08s -> 13652.12s]  That's the not motive.
[13652.84s -> 13656.61s]  That's personality or counter-revolution.
[13657.43s -> 13658.87s]  Charmed by the queen.
[13658.87s -> 13664.07s]  That's what we like to call a Marie Antoinette.
[13665.75s -> 13671.73s]  That's it.
[13671.73s -> 13673.56s]  Okay, four more questions.
[13674.85s -> 13675.89s]  Letters addressed to Marie Antoinette.
[13675.89s -> 13676.61s]  This is evidence?
[13676.61s -> 13678.53s]  No, this is the motive.
[13679.41s -> 13681.81s]  Personality.
[13682.69s -> 13688.37s]  Fuck.
[13688.37s -> 13689.73s]  Escorting Citizen Capay.
[13691.16s -> 13693.59s]  That is motive.
[13693.59s -> 13694.09s]  Dude.
[13697.35s -> 13704.55s]  God damn it.
[13711.36s -> 13712.72s]  I didn't even need to click that.
[13725.75s -> 13729.33s]  Okay, after this,
[13729.89s -> 13731.33s]  I gotta get some fucking water.
[13732.13s -> 13734.44s]  Get some fucking salt.
[13737.20s -> 13738.72s]  Uh, I can't make any more mistakes, though.
[13738.72s -> 13739.36s]  So, we've got...
[13741.03s -> 13741.91s]  This is just...
[13741.91s -> 13743.91s]  Letters addressed to Marie Antoinette.
[13743.91s -> 13745.43s]  Is extenuating circumstance.
[13746.07s -> 13752.07s]  And then, is Marie Antoinette the motive?
[13752.07s -> 13752.63s]  Hold on.
[13752.63s -> 13753.13s]  No, no, wait.
[13756.96s -> 13758.48s]  Yeah, he's either too developed to say that
[13758.48s -> 13760.24s]  later they were frequently writing letters to Marie Antoinette
[13760.24s -> 13762.48s]  to express hope for the survival of absolute monarchy, right?
[13763.52s -> 13767.52s]  And then, the evidence is letters that he wrote to Marie Antoinette.
[13774.58s -> 13775.86s]  Replenish your electrolytes.
[13775.86s -> 13776.58s]  Yeah, I'm going to.
[13777.56s -> 13779.64s]  Unfortunately, this stream is gonna probably cut short.
[13780.28s -> 13785.30s]  Because this is really starting to cause me anguish.
[13789.88s -> 13790.84s]  Charmed by the Queen.
[13791.56s -> 13793.80s]  I don't know if that's motive or just extenuating.
[13799.92s -> 13801.04s]  No, the absolute...
[13801.04s -> 13803.28s]  I'm not going to not stream Sekiro tomorrow.
[13803.28s -> 13803.84s]  You kidding me?
[13805.20s -> 13807.04s]  If anything, I want to get ready for it.
[13807.04s -> 13810.24s]  I want to get some rest and save my throat.
[13810.88s -> 13815.17s]  I'm not going to play Sekiro off stream.
[13815.17s -> 13816.61s]  Oh my god, I've been waiting for it for so long.
[13818.10s -> 13818.66s]  That's motive.
[13819.46s -> 13833.97s]  Well, she was fucking playing him.
[13837.19s -> 13838.15s]  She was playing him.
[13838.95s -> 13844.45s]  Whatever, this guy's done.
[13844.45s -> 13846.29s]  I don't need this shit.
[13846.85s -> 13852.95s]  All right, not long ago you were on the path to a grand career.
[13852.95s -> 13856.23s]  I remember your famous speech in defense of Citizen Capay.
[13856.23s -> 13857.75s]  Your charisma could have taken you to the top,
[13857.75s -> 13859.03s]  but instead you are here.
[13859.03s -> 13859.99s]  Do you not regret it?
[13860.79s -> 13863.65s]  That speech was not aimed against the revolution.
[13863.65s -> 13865.81s]  I only wish to appeal to common sense.
[13867.04s -> 13869.04s]  Many remember that performance as an attack
[13869.04s -> 13872.48s]  on everything that started in France on July 14th.
[13873.44s -> 13875.30s]  Nonsense.
[13875.30s -> 13877.14s]  The changes were essential.
[13877.94s -> 13880.58s]  Constitutional monarchy is a reasonable alternative
[13880.58s -> 13881.70s]  to the old order.
[13882.34s -> 13883.92s]  So in your opinion,
[13883.92s -> 13885.52s]  people who brought misery to France
[13885.52s -> 13886.88s]  should continue living in a palace.
[13887.60s -> 13890.02s]  I do not think they should be guillotined
[13890.02s -> 13891.38s]  only for their ancestry.
[13891.94s -> 13897.41s]  Did you ever express your feelings
[13897.41s -> 13898.69s]  to Marie Antoinette in your letters?
[13900.42s -> 13902.34s]  Did you not read our letters carefully?
[13902.98s -> 13905.14s]  I would not have dared to woo the Queen of France.
[13907.24s -> 13909.08s]  You wrote about her wisdom and kindness.
[13909.16s -> 13911.08s]  It sounds like you were paying her compliments.
[13911.72s -> 13913.73s]  Those were just pleasantries.
[13915.19s -> 13916.87s]  Maybe she was wooing him.
[13916.87s -> 13919.27s]  The Austrian whore was insatiable.
[13921.92s -> 13922.80s]  Kill him.
[13922.80s -> 13928.80s]  It would appear that in your letters,
[13928.80s -> 13930.88s]  Marie Antoinette, you tried to convince her
[13931.52s -> 13934.88s]  and her husband to support the revolution.
[13935.68s -> 13937.20s]  What would you gain from that?
[13937.92s -> 13940.47s]  I believe that we would avert the terror
[13940.47s -> 13941.67s]  we were currently facing.
[13942.23s -> 13944.96s]  Why do you think there's terror in our country?
[13944.96s -> 13947.30s]  I would not be standing here now otherwise.
[13948.84s -> 13951.08s]  You're there because you're a royal swine.
[13951.80s -> 13954.37s]  The Capais were not interested in the Constitution?
[13954.93s -> 13956.20s]  Unfortunately not.
[13957.12s -> 13958.56s]  And how would you benefit from it?
[13959.30s -> 13959.78s]  I only...
[13960.50s -> 13963.00s]  Did I catch that?
[13963.00s -> 13963.72s]  I think I did.
[13963.72s -> 13965.72s]  I only wanted what was best for my country.
[13969.30s -> 13971.62s]  Were you not afraid to openly support
[13971.62s -> 13973.78s]  the monarchs on the eve of the revolution?
[13973.78s -> 13975.22s]  That could be interpreted as treason.
[13975.86s -> 13978.74s]  I may be young and idealistic,
[13978.74s -> 13979.70s]  but I'm no traitor.
[13980.87s -> 13981.67s]  If that were true,
[13981.67s -> 13983.67s]  you'd be standing on the right side.
[13983.67s -> 13985.68s]  I love this country,
[13985.68s -> 13987.68s]  and I'm certain that the republic
[13987.68s -> 13989.60s]  which the revolutionaries are fighting for
[13989.60s -> 13990.08s]  is not...
[13990.88s -> 13991.12s]  a...
[13992.00s -> 13993.12s]  Anassia.
[13995.09s -> 13996.21s]  If you fight the republic,
[13996.21s -> 13997.33s]  you fight France itself.
[13998.61s -> 14000.76s]  What is it, snowing?
[14000.76s -> 14016.47s]  French YouTuber voice.
[14017.19s -> 14050.63s]  I'm sick of listening to your shit.
[14051.19s -> 14052.79s]  We already saw this movie.
[14052.79s -> 14054.31s]  I've no further questions, thank you.
[14054.31s -> 14055.91s]  I said to citizen Antoine Barnard,
[14055.91s -> 14057.11s]  that by the Aguiq team,
[14058.52s -> 14060.12s]  that's how every court should operate
[14060.12s -> 14064.10s]  swift and bold.
[14064.10s -> 14065.78s]  And does it matter what we have to say?
[14065.78s -> 14067.86s]  You'd better take us into account in the future.
[14071.32s -> 14072.36s]  Look, it's all balanced.
[14076.00s -> 14077.12s]  Enemy at the courthouse.
[14077.92s -> 14080.28s]  The jury noticed you making the wrong choices
[14080.28s -> 14081.40s]  and forgoing justice.
[14081.40s -> 14082.44s]  The rumors spread fast.
[14082.44s -> 14084.04s]  That's what happened in reality.
[14085.91s -> 14087.83s]  I'm basing my shit on the book.
[14087.83s -> 14090.87s]  You can adapt your Game of Thrones season fucking seven
[14090.87s -> 14091.83s]  however you want.
[14091.83s -> 14093.35s]  You can change the ending.
[14093.35s -> 14094.79s]  Not me, I'm going right to the books.
[14095.35s -> 14107.40s]  Hey guys, welcome back to part 143
[14107.40s -> 14108.28s]  of my YouTube series.
[14108.28s -> 14109.48s]  Today we're going to get
[14109.48s -> 14111.96s]  sentenced to death for supporting the monarchy.
[14113.24s -> 14115.56s]  It's agent, you ordered me to silence.
[14115.56s -> 14116.92s]  It is done, but there's something
[14116.92s -> 14118.20s]  you need to see for yourself.
[14118.20s -> 14118.84s]  Who is this?
[14119.48s -> 14129.51s]  All right, speak to the comic book.
[14132.56s -> 14134.80s]  Carefree for the crime.
[14135.36s -> 14136.88s]  So should I be careless with this?
[14137.68s -> 14138.24s]  Whatever.
[14139.44s -> 14141.44s]  They're oversensitive about the defendant.
[14142.00s -> 14147.35s]  Carelessness, they're oversensitive
[14147.35s -> 14148.95s]  so we can do some humility here.
[14150.92s -> 14152.12s]  And then revolution,
[14152.12s -> 14153.56s]  let's go straight up aggressive.
[14156.40s -> 14157.76s]  Perfect, strong
[14159.35s -> 14160.39s]  and revolution.
[14165.12s -> 14167.44s]  Manipulate or humility?
[14168.16s -> 14174.47s]  Probably manipulate.
[14175.19s -> 14181.24s]  Careless, humility, and manipulate.
[14182.28s -> 14187.72s]  For this convict here,
[14187.72s -> 14189.80s]  killing was as easy as breathing.
[14189.80s -> 14191.72s]  That's how this guillotine is to us.
[14192.84s -> 14195.20s]  I'm telling a joke.
[14195.20s -> 14196.16s]  Humility.
[14196.16s -> 14197.44s]  The criminals belong in the grave
[14197.44s -> 14198.88s]  only then we can build a better future.
[14199.52s -> 14203.09s]  Yes, and then manipulation.
[14203.65s -> 14204.93s]  Future generations will remember
[14204.93s -> 14206.13s]  that we were not cowards.
[14206.13s -> 14206.93s]  It needs to be done.
[14208.05s -> 14208.85s]  And everyone's happy.
[14211.27s -> 14216.36s]  Reputation plus three.
[14216.36s -> 14217.80s]  I performed my duties
[14217.80s -> 14219.56s]  when the king was equal to France
[14219.56s -> 14221.56s]  and this is how France repays me.
[14233.30s -> 14234.98s]  Boo, for the revolution.
[14234.98s -> 14236.90s]  Boo, why are you always booing me?
[14240.13s -> 14247.57s]  That guy's usually happy.
[14247.57s -> 14249.41s]  Oh, he didn't get a good seat this time.
[14250.34s -> 14258.44s]  He didn't get her quick enough.
[14258.44s -> 14260.60s]  Do you want to show me a common dead body?
[14261.76s -> 14263.84s]  It's not just a dead body.
[14263.84s -> 14265.28s]  Look at that necklace.
[14265.28s -> 14265.84s]  It's Winston.
[14266.48s -> 14268.96s]  A fleur de lis.
[14268.96s -> 14270.16s]  That's the Winston voice actor.
[14270.16s -> 14272.48s]  There's more hidden under his clothes.
[14274.79s -> 14277.27s]  We found a message in the inner pocket of his cloak.
[14277.27s -> 14277.83s]  No, it's not.
[14277.83s -> 14278.55s]  It's an order.
[14279.35s -> 14281.19s]  Someone told that man to build support
[14281.19s -> 14283.51s]  for a mysterious R in the district.
[14285.97s -> 14288.37s]  Who is arrogant enough to take Louis place?
[14288.37s -> 14290.21s]  You guys thought my French accents weren't good.
[14290.21s -> 14291.89s]  Only aristocrats are powerful enough
[14291.89s -> 14293.81s]  to secretly organize people like him.
[14293.81s -> 14295.49s]  These guys have an American accent.
[14296.13s -> 14297.44s]  I'm at least in the same hemisphere.
[14297.44s -> 14299.92s]  Even they would need help from someone in the convention.
[14300.64s -> 14302.08s]  So who is R?
[14303.78s -> 14305.06s]  Robespierre, maybe.
[14305.06s -> 14306.98s]  If he's allying with aristocrats,
[14306.98s -> 14309.46s]  we must tell someone, everyone.
[14312.08s -> 14313.68s]  It could be Minister Roland.
[14314.48s -> 14316.16s]  As long as we are not sure,
[14316.16s -> 14317.60s]  we would only create panic.
[14319.83s -> 14321.03s]  If that's the case,
[14321.03s -> 14322.55s]  we'll have to hunt down other agents.
[14323.35s -> 14324.95s]  This one won't be telling us anything.
[14325.59s -> 14326.63s]  We have no other choice.
[14329.00s -> 14331.32s]  If this R is trying to gain support,
[14331.88s -> 14334.12s]  you must do the same for the greater good.
[14335.00s -> 14336.36s]  It's that Robespierre guy.
[14337.08s -> 14338.31s]  He's at the top.
[14338.95s -> 14341.73s]  When are they going to add vibe support?
[14342.45s -> 14344.66s]  The evening is warm,
[14344.66s -> 14346.26s]  so you decide to take the long way home.
[14346.26s -> 14347.78s]  Near the Café Chantilly,
[14347.78s -> 14349.22s]  you spot an amusing scene.
[14349.22s -> 14351.70s]  Two drunkards fighting over a bottle of liquor.
[14351.70s -> 14353.22s]  Cursing like stable boys.
[14353.22s -> 14354.26s]  The first is shorter
[14354.26s -> 14356.10s]  and dressed in a disheveled officer's uniform,
[14356.10s -> 14357.22s]  possibly a colonel.
[14357.22s -> 14357.94s]  The second fighter,
[14357.94s -> 14359.62s]  although significantly taller,
[14359.62s -> 14361.22s]  is just an ordinary street thug.
[14361.78s -> 14365.06s]  You listen to the gibberish and tangled epathies,
[14365.70s -> 14366.90s]  only to reach the conclusion
[14366.90s -> 14369.38s]  that the bottle contains one last gulp of drink.
[14370.10s -> 14373.16s]  Try to settle the dispute between the drunkards.
[14374.04s -> 14377.09s]  The two enemies unite in the face of a stranger
[14377.09s -> 14378.45s]  in an elegant coat.
[14378.45s -> 14380.37s]  It surely looks comical to the observers
[14380.37s -> 14382.93s]  when, in a fit of booze-driven solidarity,
[14382.93s -> 14384.45s]  one tries to hit you in the head
[14384.45s -> 14385.81s]  with the disputed object,
[14386.45s -> 14387.81s]  while the other kicks at your ankle.
[14388.37s -> 14389.25s]  He dodges the bottle,
[14389.25s -> 14391.17s]  which smashes on a nearby wall,
[14391.17s -> 14393.41s]  spilling the remaining alcohol everywhere.
[14393.41s -> 14395.33s]  However, the kick is a success
[14395.33s -> 14397.01s]  and immobilizes you long enough
[14397.09s -> 14399.81s]  for the drunkards to disappear down a back alley.
[14399.81s -> 14400.69s]  It takes some time
[14400.69s -> 14402.29s]  for the bystanders to stop laughing.
[14402.93s -> 14404.37s]  And I'm a judge
[14405.09s -> 14407.12s]  and I could literally,
[14407.12s -> 14409.60s]  I could have your tongue out.
[14409.60s -> 14422.64s]  Should I do this?
[14422.64s -> 14426.26s]  How should I do this?
[14426.26s -> 14427.14s]  Evening stroll.
[14427.14s -> 14427.94s]  No, we're gonna,
[14427.94s -> 14429.54s]  everyone's doing so good.
[14430.58s -> 14432.10s]  Evening with grandfather.
[14432.10s -> 14435.72s]  Yeah, it's okay to lose points here.
[14437.60s -> 14438.64s]  He's hard to please.
[14438.64s -> 14440.80s]  That's an entire evening with grandpa
[14442.45s -> 14450.69s]  and it's not even a centimeter dead.
[14450.69s -> 14451.57s]  I would.
[14451.57s -> 14457.12s]  Why is this on fire?
[14458.84s -> 14461.08s]  Riots block agents except the bruiser
[14461.08s -> 14462.92s]  and prevent you from gaining influence
[14462.92s -> 14463.88s]  points from the section.
[14464.52s -> 14465.62s]  When not quelled,
[14465.62s -> 14466.90s]  riots make a section neutral
[14466.90s -> 14467.94s]  and can quickly spread.
[14470.50s -> 14471.06s]  Get in there.
[14478.00s -> 14478.64s]  Let's head back.
[14481.65s -> 14484.47s]  Increase your influence.
[14486.23s -> 14487.51s]  Just increase influence over here.
[14488.23s -> 14489.99s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[14489.99s -> 14491.03s]  Five community subs.
[14491.03s -> 14493.03s]  Thank you for the five subs.
[14493.75s -> 14497.35s]  Let's try to quell the unrest here.
[14498.07s -> 14500.58s]  But did you, did you,
[14501.30s -> 14501.78s]  hold on.
[14502.34s -> 14504.90s]  Your name used to be an all lowercase.
[14506.07s -> 14508.29s]  Didn't it?
[14508.29s -> 14509.33s]  Did you change your name
[14509.33s -> 14510.77s]  to add uppercase letters?
[14514.64s -> 14515.44s]  That's what you did.
[14518.85s -> 14519.35s]  Why?
[14519.97s -> 14521.01s]  All right.
[14521.01s -> 14521.65s]  I'll be right back.
[14522.63s -> 14523.35s]  And I actually,
[14525.03s -> 14526.88s]  I'm probably gonna have to stop here.
[14527.52s -> 14528.08s]  I'm sorry.
[14528.72s -> 14532.15s]  I'm getting raw in the back.
[14532.87s -> 14535.25s]  Sorry for like the four
[14535.89s -> 14536.93s]  to five hour stream.
[14538.21s -> 14543.36s]  Hold on.
[14543.36s -> 14544.72s]  I just, it's starting to hurt.
[14547.16s -> 14548.20s]  Let me, let me, hold on.
[14548.20s -> 14549.00s]  I'm not gonna say that yet.
[14549.00s -> 14549.88s]  Let me go get some,
[14549.88s -> 14551.48s]  like I'm gonna gargle some salt water
[14551.48s -> 14553.00s]  and like have a drink of water.
[14553.00s -> 14554.04s]  And let me just see how I am
[14554.04s -> 14554.76s]  in like two minutes.
[14554.76s -> 14555.96s]  I'll be right back.
[14555.96s -> 14564.36s]  And yes, regardless,
[14564.36s -> 14565.32s]  Sekiro is tomorrow.
[14565.32s -> 14566.12s]  Sekiro tomorrow.
[14568.37s -> 14569.01s]  Probably all day.
[14570.29s -> 14571.49s]  From the moment I get up,
[14571.49s -> 14573.09s]  I don't know when the stream's gonna start,
[14573.09s -> 14574.05s]  but I'm just gonna play
[14574.05s -> 14575.09s]  the absolute hell out of it.
[14578.45s -> 14579.09s]  So I'll be right back.
[14579.09s -> 14580.53s]  We'll just, we'll see in a second.
[14580.53s -> 14586.80s]  Too sick for Sekiro tomorrow, guaranteed.
[14586.80s -> 14587.44s]  No way.
[14587.44s -> 14589.28s]  I've been waiting too long to play this.
[14589.28s -> 14590.24s]  No, that's not gonna happen.
[14591.04s -> 14592.48s]  I don't care if I have to mute myself.
[14593.92s -> 14595.76s]  It'll be like a no talking stream.
[14595.76s -> 14772.96s]  I'll be right back.
[14772.96s -> 14773.68s]  All right.
[14773.68s -> 14775.49s]  Hooray.
[14775.49s -> 14778.56s]  Cough syrup is coming in.
[14778.56s -> 14779.20s]  Rejoicing.
[14783.36s -> 14786.00s]  But I am gonna just call it.
[14786.00s -> 14790.05s]  I was down there talking to Kim
[14790.05s -> 14791.41s]  and I've decided
[14792.61s -> 14795.17s]  it's probably for the best
[14795.17s -> 14797.01s]  because if I like keep going,
[14797.01s -> 14798.45s]  I keep talking and keep like
[14800.13s -> 14802.44s]  irritating the area that I did tomorrow.
[14802.44s -> 14804.12s]  Sekiro, you know what I'm saying?
[14804.12s -> 14805.56s]  Like I want to be fucking ready to go
[14805.56s -> 14807.08s]  completely all day.
[14810.21s -> 14811.17s]  Can you hear her?
[14811.17s -> 14813.76s]  Hold on.
[14813.76s -> 14814.48s]  She's coughing too.
[14821.17s -> 14821.89s]  Yeah.
[14821.89s -> 14823.17s]  She got it first.
[14823.17s -> 14824.13s]  She has it bad.
[14824.13s -> 14824.93s]  Mine's not that bad.
[14824.93s -> 14825.81s]  I hope it doesn't progress.
[14825.81s -> 14826.53s]  That'd be terrible.
[14828.42s -> 14830.58s]  But I'll be honest with you here.
[14831.30s -> 14832.76s]  This game is actually fucking fun.
[14833.56s -> 14835.48s]  And I would recommend that you play this game
[14835.48s -> 14836.28s]  if you think, you know,
[14836.84s -> 14839.80s]  if you like doing this kind of thing.
[14840.36s -> 14842.84s]  What a terrible, terrible review that I just gave.
[14843.72s -> 14845.00s]  It's good if you like this,
[14845.00s -> 14846.52s]  if you kind of like this kind of thing.
[14847.57s -> 14847.81s]  Yeah.
[14847.81s -> 14848.29s]  No shit.
[14850.44s -> 14851.48s]  Italics is not sick.
[14851.48s -> 14852.76s]  I don't know how me and Kim got this.
[14853.56s -> 14855.01s]  I have no idea.
[14855.57s -> 14859.99s]  It's really only been the last couple of days though.
[14864.05s -> 14864.61s]  But yeah.
[14864.61s -> 14867.01s]  I'm gonna just get ready for Sekiro tomorrow.
[14868.13s -> 14869.65s]  I'm gonna do the thing that I should do.
[14871.67s -> 14872.87s]  And unfortunately,
[14872.87s -> 14874.63s]  we're gonna have like a four and a half hours stream.
[14875.92s -> 14876.56s]  But, and I'm sorry.
[14876.56s -> 14878.08s]  I haven't been gone for four days
[14878.08s -> 14880.72s]  for unrelated friend of mine came up.
[14880.72s -> 14882.88s]  And really the day coming back,
[14882.88s -> 14883.60s]  I don't want to be like,
[14883.60s -> 14885.12s]  see you later after like four hours.
[14885.76s -> 14887.48s]  But we are gonna go
[14888.60s -> 14890.28s]  probably Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[14890.92s -> 14891.80s]  Because I'm just gonna,
[14891.80s -> 14893.40s]  obviously Sekiro is gonna be on the mind.
[14895.56s -> 14898.05s]  So with that, I'll see you tomorrow.
[14898.05s -> 14899.89s]  If you don't want Sekiro to be spoiled,
[14900.77s -> 14901.57s]  then by all means,
[14902.37s -> 14905.17s]  I'll just see you again when that's over with.
[14906.07s -> 14909.03s]  And later on in this coming week,
[14909.75s -> 14912.71s]  Monster Rancher 4 and probably Monster Rancher 2,
[14912.71s -> 14915.91s]  depending on how bad or good Monster Rancher 4 is.
[14915.91s -> 14917.30s]  I'll be going back to it.
[14917.94s -> 14919.22s]  So that's kind of the plan.
[14920.21s -> 14923.09s]  Maybe go back to VR a little after that.
[14923.09s -> 14923.59s]  Possibly.
[14924.29s -> 14931.51s]  So, so, I will see you guys tomorrow for Sekiro.
[14931.51s -> 14934.00s]  I'm fucking insanely excited for it.
[14934.72s -> 14937.25s]  And again, sorry for the short stream tonight.
[14937.81s -> 14939.52s]  But I'm gonna rest up my voice.
[14941.40s -> 14942.44s]  And like I said,
[14942.44s -> 14944.68s]  of course the day coming back and having like,
[14944.68s -> 14946.60s]  oh, let me pick a game where I read,
[14947.48s -> 14950.93s]  where I'm gonna read a shit little dialogue.
[14950.93s -> 14957.64s]  What a, what a dope, you know what I mean?
[14957.64s -> 14959.08s]  Friday, yeah, the Sekiro,
[14959.08s -> 14961.88s]  Sekiro is technically out in like 30 or 40 minutes or something.
[14961.88s -> 14964.47s]  But I'm gonna wait till tomorrow.
[14965.03s -> 14967.09s]  Thank you so much.
[14967.09s -> 14971.72s]  Hope you enjoyed the time that we had here today.
[14971.72s -> 14973.72s]  I'll see you for Sekiro tomorrow.
[14973.72s -> 14974.76s]  Have a great one.
[14977.28s -> 14979.60s]  Catch you guys later.
[14979.60s -> 14981.54s]  And with that being said,
[14982.82s -> 14987.01s]  we are going to do the bits we pulled up.
[15005.78s -> 15011.08s]  Okay, so we have earlier today.
[15017.24s -> 15017.80s]  Out of the way.
[15019.92s -> 15025.75s]  Okay, so we had sad Vega for the 250.
[15025.75s -> 15026.63s]  Thank you, sad Vega.
[15027.60s -> 15028.96s]  They say Sekiro tomorrow.
[15028.96s -> 15031.68s]  As you know, it's gonna be amazing, horrible time for you.
[15031.68s -> 15035.36s]  Sorry in advance for all the day one backseating you're gonna get.
[15035.92s -> 15039.28s]  I'm going to blitz that game tomorrow just to see all the shit you go through
[15039.28s -> 15044.08s]  and laugh gleefully like a shit goblin as you suffer what I suffered through.
[15044.16s -> 15045.36s]  I'll be rooting for you though 100%.
[15046.16s -> 15047.84s]  Also, your mother is coming up to visit.
[15047.84s -> 15049.52s]  Don't you mean down or left?
[15050.08s -> 15053.76s]  Because you're in Vegas, which I'm sure is southwest of Boston.
[15056.16s -> 15056.72s]  That's true.
[15057.28s -> 15057.52s]  Yes.
[15058.64s -> 15060.08s]  But I always say up no matter what.
[15060.72s -> 15062.80s]  Coming up somewhere, coming up somewhere, I always say up.
[15063.84s -> 15065.68s]  Coming down left just doesn't sound right.
[15066.32s -> 15069.14s]  But I'm looking forward to it.
[15070.02s -> 15072.15s]  Hey, how do you know you're gonna blow through it?
[15072.15s -> 15072.95s]  What if you get stuck?
[15073.59s -> 15074.47s]  It might happen.
[15076.50s -> 15078.42s]  Labo VR is out now.
[15078.42s -> 15079.14s]  The video is.
[15080.84s -> 15083.32s]  Yeah, I can look into that too when that's coming up.
[15085.25s -> 15086.13s]  Tutorial boss.
[15086.13s -> 15087.17s]  Maybe I'll get stuck on it.
[15087.17s -> 15087.65s]  I don't know.
[15087.65s -> 15088.45s]  I hope I do.
[15089.75s -> 15094.63s]  I hope I get like locked at an encounter for like 45 minutes to an hour or something.
[15095.75s -> 15097.03s]  I miss that shit.
[15097.03s -> 15102.16s]  I miss not knowing what to do and it's a whole new experience.
[15102.16s -> 15102.72s]  I cannot wait.
[15106.40s -> 15108.24s]  Every death gift of one sub.
[15108.24s -> 15109.04s]  I'm not gonna do that.
[15112.24s -> 15113.36s]  Only an hour.
[15115.01s -> 15118.55s]  Yeah, it's possible.
[15119.51s -> 15120.07s]  But thank you.
[15120.07s -> 15122.47s]  Thank you Toshiro.TV for the five bucks.
[15123.11s -> 15126.47s]  I'm super excited for you to play Sekiro and I'm gonna be playing the heck out of it too.
[15126.47s -> 15128.79s]  But remember that there's not just dodging anymore.
[15128.79s -> 15130.23s]  It's gonna be weird to adjust.
[15130.23s -> 15132.31s]  But the posture system is really well designed.
[15133.11s -> 15135.11s]  Yeah, I've read some reviews about it.
[15135.91s -> 15139.99s]  And no, I thought there was one coming.
[15139.99s -> 15140.39s]  We're good.
[15141.43s -> 15146.69s]  Yeah, there's a whole system now on parries, right?
[15146.69s -> 15147.81s]  Not like there was before.
[15147.81s -> 15151.09s]  The parries are not the same throughout all the From Software games.
[15152.31s -> 15156.95s]  It's now there's an indicator and there's three different moves that you can do to block or parry.
[15158.26s -> 15159.62s]  It's not just like the,
[15159.62s -> 15160.10s]  DOOM!
[15160.10s -> 15160.82s]  Knock the thing up.
[15160.82s -> 15164.34s]  You have to actually do a certain maneuver, right?
[15164.98s -> 15168.10s]  Not just like hit left trigger, from my understanding.
[15168.10s -> 15169.94s]  And you get like a telegraph of when it's gonna happen.
[15171.38s -> 15172.50s]  So I don't know.
[15175.62s -> 15176.66s]  I'm so sorry.
[15177.86s -> 15178.50s]  I'm so sorry.
[15178.50s -> 15179.22s]  That was bad.
[15180.02s -> 15182.98s]  I'm sure a lot of people probably just like so sick of hearing this tonight.
[15182.98s -> 15186.82s]  Which is another reason why I'm like, it's probably for the best to stop.
[15189.94s -> 15190.66s]  So, sorry.
[15194.52s -> 15195.24s]  He's dying.
[15195.24s -> 15198.10s]  No, I'm fine.
[15198.10s -> 15200.18s]  But yeah, there's a whole, there's like two health bars, right?
[15200.18s -> 15202.34s]  One of them is the posture system.
[15202.34s -> 15203.46s]  One of them is the health bar.
[15203.46s -> 15206.10s]  I'm sure it'll take a lot of getting used to, but that's, you know.
[15206.10s -> 15206.98s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[15207.94s -> 15209.92s]  Thank you.
[15211.20s -> 15211.60s]  Thank you.
[15211.60s -> 15213.28s]  WildFox1 for the three bucks.
[15213.28s -> 15215.84s]  Dear Jeremiah, on behalf of your recommendation,
[15215.84s -> 15219.60s]  I have bought some metal straws and I can say it was a good buy.
[15219.60s -> 15220.40s]  So thanks for that.
[15220.40s -> 15224.23s]  Yeah, metal straws are awesome.
[15225.62s -> 15227.30s]  The liquid stays cold going through.
[15228.63s -> 15232.07s]  As for the question, I present each with each bit message.
[15232.07s -> 15236.23s]  Why the fuck did you let that globalist mutant frog out into the wild?
[15236.23s -> 15238.15s]  Do you want to watch the world burn?
[15241.67s -> 15243.91s]  Referencing Seaman, if you don't know.
[15246.00s -> 15246.72s]  I had to see the credits.
[15246.72s -> 15247.60s]  That's my reasoning.
[15249.43s -> 15250.39s]  Thank you, though, WildFox.
[15250.39s -> 15251.59s]  Thank you, Jules, for the 250.
[15251.59s -> 15254.71s]  Have you thought about playing role-play games like GTA RP?
[15254.71s -> 15256.23s]  It's been getting a lot of attention recently.
[15256.23s -> 15257.19s]  I think you'd be good at it.
[15257.83s -> 15265.94s]  I think it would be a lot of fun, but I think I've, at least me personally,
[15265.94s -> 15272.12s]  I don't like to jump into random sessions with people that I don't know
[15273.08s -> 15276.20s]  because it's hard for me to bounce off of strangers.
[15278.04s -> 15282.68s]  If I get a few friends and we kind of all are in on the same jokes and the same material,
[15283.56s -> 15285.96s]  it's really easy to create scenarios and create fun.
[15287.24s -> 15291.56s]  But I don't really like to jump into just complete stranger scenarios
[15291.56s -> 15292.84s]  where somebody says something.
[15292.84s -> 15297.64s]  I mean, it would be fun, but it almost feels like, in a way for me,
[15299.30s -> 15303.14s]  when there's like a ton of people all kind of doing a bit at the same time,
[15304.10s -> 15308.84s]  it's hard to have your bit be a thing that you want to care about.
[15308.84s -> 15309.32s]  You know what I mean?
[15311.12s -> 15314.96s]  If you've got like 10 people all making something happen,
[15315.60s -> 15318.00s]  realistically, only a couple people can talk at once.
[15318.80s -> 15322.16s]  And what it ends up being, it ends up being one or two people's stories
[15322.16s -> 15324.72s]  that everybody else has to kind of find out how they're going to fit
[15324.72s -> 15326.48s]  into involved inside of it, right?
[15327.84s -> 15334.63s]  You could pretend to be a traveling salesman and pass through town
[15334.63s -> 15335.91s]  and only play for like a week.
[15336.79s -> 15342.63s]  Yeah, and don't a lot of the RP servers have pretty staunch rules
[15342.63s -> 15344.15s]  on what your character can do?
[15346.15s -> 15348.07s]  Isn't it like a commitment you really need to go in there
[15348.07s -> 15356.82s]  and follow like terms and you need to take improv classes?
[15356.82s -> 15361.36s]  No, it's just when there's so many people all doing the same thing.
[15362.79s -> 15366.23s]  Improv is improv, but when like 15 people are all doing improv
[15366.23s -> 15368.87s]  at the same time, it can just turn into noise.
[15369.83s -> 15370.95s]  That's what I'm saying.
[15371.59s -> 15378.44s]  That seems to happen with a lot of kind of,
[15378.44s -> 15381.08s]  it's almost like the scenario where, and this is,
[15381.08s -> 15385.89s]  this might sound like I'm talking shit or something, but I'm not.
[15386.61s -> 15392.12s]  But back in the day in YouTube, everybody was making a video, right?
[15392.84s -> 15396.20s]  So what would happen is if you got like five, six, seven people
[15396.20s -> 15400.76s]  that you're all new or you were kind of all going into a scenario with,
[15401.48s -> 15403.72s]  all of you were recording at the same time,
[15404.60s -> 15407.40s]  and all of you want to make the video,
[15407.40s -> 15410.04s]  and all of you want to make the joke.
[15411.00s -> 15412.60s]  So what ends up happening is just like,
[15415.16s -> 15416.52s]  it's almost incomprehensible.
[15418.92s -> 15421.08s]  Everybody's got their own intros,
[15421.08s -> 15422.52s]  everybody's got their own like characters,
[15422.52s -> 15424.68s]  everybody's got their own shit that they want to say
[15424.68s -> 15426.44s]  because they're making a video too,
[15426.44s -> 15430.44s]  they want to be the spotlight because their people are watching,
[15430.44s -> 15431.08s]  you know what I'm saying?
[15435.65s -> 15439.11s]  That's why it was always so much easier to, you know,
[15439.11s -> 15440.71s]  get like one or two people together,
[15440.71s -> 15444.71s]  and everybody knows kind of what we're going to do for this bit,
[15444.71s -> 15445.51s]  and where we're going to say,
[15446.15s -> 15447.11s]  how fun are we going to make it,
[15447.11s -> 15448.31s]  and what we're going to do this time.
[15448.31s -> 15450.47s]  And even if it was completely all off the cuff and improv,
[15450.47s -> 15451.91s]  which a lot of it was, most of it was,
[15455.11s -> 15457.51s]  30 main characters and no supporting cast.
[15457.51s -> 15458.23s]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[15458.95s -> 15462.84s]  And that's not intended to like throw like shade at somebody,
[15462.84s -> 15466.60s]  it's just personally I don't do well in an environment
[15466.60s -> 15470.12s]  where everybody's all trying to make a joke at the same time,
[15470.92s -> 15472.92s]  because everybody has their camera pointed at them.
[15473.80s -> 15483.88s]  You can hang out with only one or two people,
[15483.88s -> 15486.04s]  lots of streamers have just broken up into gangs.
[15487.91s -> 15489.35s]  I mean, I don't know anything about it.
[15489.91s -> 15493.03s]  All I know is that it's really, really popular right now,
[15493.03s -> 15494.95s]  and anytime you jump into something really popular,
[15494.95s -> 15496.07s]  you kind of, it's kind of inevitable
[15496.07s -> 15497.67s]  that you're going to just get landed somewhere,
[15497.67s -> 15500.39s]  and all right, where's the camera pointing,
[15500.39s -> 15501.35s]  and where are we going, right?
[15509.56s -> 15512.36s]  And that's not me talking specifically about GTA RP,
[15512.36s -> 15520.15s]  that's just talking about the nature of kind of online playing
[15520.15s -> 15523.51s]  or making a video or streaming with a bunch of other people
[15523.51s -> 15524.63s]  that are all doing the same thing.
[15536.61s -> 15540.08s]  But it's not something that I think it would be a lot of fun,
[15540.08s -> 15542.48s]  it's just I'm not sure exactly even where to start
[15542.48s -> 15543.20s]  with something like that.
[15544.90s -> 15546.66s]  Because I really would just be like every,
[15546.66s -> 15549.46s]  like you said, people break off into like gangs and stuff,
[15549.46s -> 15552.66s]  and I would just be the one dickhead walking around,
[15552.66s -> 15556.42s]  like I said, trying to find the content to be a part of.
[15557.54s -> 15560.15s]  Oh, we got like these like five guys are doing this,
[15560.15s -> 15561.75s]  these like four or five people are doing this,
[15561.75s -> 15563.83s]  and I'm just like, hey, I just joined.
[15567.19s -> 15570.63s]  Alert, alert, it's me, alert, I'm here, alert.
[15570.63s -> 15572.23s]  Like, I don't even know where to start.
[15581.19s -> 15585.22s]  But anyways, hopefully that kind of answers the question of
[15586.24s -> 15591.36s]  why I don't typically do RP based stuff on stream or on video.
[15592.16s -> 15593.60s]  Especially people that I don't know.
[15593.60s -> 15595.52s]  That's the number one reason.
[15596.24s -> 15598.32s]  Number one is with people that I don't know, right?
[15598.32s -> 15602.37s]  But thank you for the 250.
[15602.37s -> 15603.97s]  Thank you Mad for the $5.
[15604.69s -> 15606.72s]  Hey, Jerma, hope all is well.
[15606.72s -> 15608.48s]  I'm heading to Boston on Saturday for college,
[15608.48s -> 15610.96s]  so I might not be able to see some of your streams, but hey.
[15612.44s -> 15614.52s]  Well, welcome to Boston.
[15620.36s -> 15622.52s]  Boston is a wonderful city.
[15623.32s -> 15623.82s]  Enjoy it.
[15626.66s -> 15628.10s]  Going to college in Boston is that,
[15628.90s -> 15632.18s]  that's, I don't know if it's a new thing
[15632.18s -> 15635.38s]  or something you've been doing already, but good luck.
[15636.10s -> 15643.40s]  And I don't know how far away you are, but hope you enjoy it.
[15644.04s -> 15649.62s]  All the people I work with from there are pretty straightforward.
[15651.25s -> 15655.67s]  Yeah, I mean, Boston is kind of one of those cities
[15655.67s -> 15657.91s]  where it's just, who are you?
[15657.91s -> 15658.47s]  What do you want?
[15659.03s -> 15661.35s]  And how do I get it to you as fast as possible?
[15661.35s -> 15662.23s]  So you leave me alone.
[15662.87s -> 15665.59s]  That's like a lot of like Boston.
[15665.59s -> 15666.47s]  Who are you?
[15666.47s -> 15667.43s]  Oh, my name is Jeremy.
[15667.43s -> 15668.15s]  Okay, what do you want?
[15669.27s -> 15670.79s]  I want a sandwich.
[15670.79s -> 15671.67s]  All right, here, here you go.
[15671.67s -> 15672.87s]  It's done already.
[15672.87s -> 15673.91s]  I didn't even order.
[15673.91s -> 15674.79s]  Are you sure you didn't?
[15675.35s -> 15676.95s]  And then they bring the order that I was going to order.
[15677.67s -> 15679.91s]  I, that's what I thought.
[15679.91s -> 15680.79s]  Okay, thank you.
[15680.79s -> 15681.59s]  Bye.
[15681.59s -> 15690.23s]  Thank you Tingy for the 250.
[15690.79s -> 15694.24s]  Jerma, I don't think I could wear your shirts in public anymore.
[15695.12s -> 15695.52s]  Why not?
[15695.52s -> 15696.64s]  Over the weekend I was out
[15696.64s -> 15698.96s]  and someone saw me wearing my night sky shirt
[15698.96s -> 15700.40s]  and it must have angered them.
[15701.36s -> 15703.04s]  He pointed at me and starts yelling
[15703.04s -> 15704.96s]  shpee compact streamer another weird thing.
[15708.47s -> 15709.67s]  This is bullshit is what you're saying.
[15710.31s -> 15711.25s]  It's a great shirt.
[15711.25s -> 15711.73s]  You should wear it.
[15712.45s -> 15713.89s]  Thank you though.
[15714.45s -> 15716.56s]  I'm going to like turn my mic fucking down.
[15718.80s -> 15720.16s]  I hate being a coughing.
[15723.38s -> 15723.86s]  It's all right.
[15726.56s -> 15728.72s]  Thank you for the 20 bucks earlier.
[15729.44s -> 15729.76s]  Thank you.
[15731.84s -> 15733.36s]  Jeremy the Jerm, the big Jerm.
[15733.92s -> 15734.72s]  I have a request.
[15734.72s -> 15738.72s]  My dearest friend Haley is having a birthday bash and I need you.
[15739.36s -> 15739.60s]  Okay.
[15740.48s -> 15742.87s]  Her favorite hunk o' man.
[15743.91s -> 15748.31s]  I need you, her favorite hunk o' man
[15748.31s -> 15750.87s]  to wish upon her the happiest birthday
[15750.87s -> 15753.75s]  you've ever wished upon anyone upon reading this.
[15754.79s -> 15756.79s]  I need you to go hard on this one for me.
[15756.79s -> 15757.59s]  As hard as you can.
[15758.23s -> 15759.75s]  Possibly get for 20 dollars.
[15762.79s -> 15763.43s]  Well, all right.
[15763.99s -> 15765.72s]  Somebody clip this.
[15765.72s -> 15767.16s]  Don't get this first part though.
[15767.80s -> 15772.76s]  Haley.
[15772.84s -> 15773.70s]  Hold on.
[15773.70s -> 15774.74s]  No, no, not this part.
[15774.74s -> 15775.46s]  Starting now.
[15779.12s -> 15779.52s]  Haley.
[15780.80s -> 15781.92s]  Happy birthday.
[15781.92s -> 15783.73s]  Just want to make that very clear.
[15784.29s -> 15786.29s]  Hope you have a wonderful birthday, Haley.
[15788.18s -> 15790.18s]  I don't know what your last name is
[15790.98s -> 15792.10s]  but I just know you're Haley
[15792.10s -> 15794.66s]  and I know that you're going to have a great fucking birthday.
[15794.66s -> 15795.30s]  You know why?
[15795.86s -> 15800.15s]  Because I just deemed it necessary.
[15800.15s -> 15800.79s]  I want one.
[15800.79s -> 15801.99s]  Is that somebody somebody right there?
[15801.99s -> 15804.79s]  I want you to load up the crowd right now.
[15804.79s -> 15806.87s]  There's at least 400 people at your party.
[15806.87s -> 15808.55s]  Look at one, two, three, four, five.
[15808.55s -> 15809.35s]  Stop blowing the horns.
[15809.99s -> 15811.25s]  Put on the party hats.
[15811.89s -> 15813.35s]  Get the ice cream out.
[15813.35s -> 15814.88s]  Because it's your birthday.
[15814.88s -> 15817.12s]  And everybody on earth should be celebrating.
[15817.12s -> 15819.04s]  I want this to be broadcast on fucking TV.
[15820.72s -> 15821.60s]  And it will be.
[15821.60s -> 15824.72s]  I'm going to spend the 645,000 dollars it takes
[15824.72s -> 15827.20s]  to put this and put it on every station.
[15827.92s -> 15834.66s]  Happy birthday.
[15834.66s -> 15838.24s]  And tune into like MTV in a week
[15838.24s -> 15840.96s]  and when I pay Viacom, that's a lie.
[15840.96s -> 15842.00s]  But happy birthday, Haley.
[15842.64s -> 15844.26s]  Hope you have a great day.
[15844.82s -> 15850.68s]  Of course, you got friends.
[15851.32s -> 15852.84s]  You got all kinds of friends that care about you.
[15852.84s -> 15853.32s]  That's good.
[15856.20s -> 15857.24s]  Looking out for you, you know?
[15857.96s -> 15858.84s]  Happy birthday.
[15861.27s -> 15864.58s]  Hey, Professor Breen.
[15864.58s -> 15865.94s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[15865.94s -> 15866.50s]  And that's it.
[15867.30s -> 15869.43s]  Thank you so much, Professor Breen.
[15869.99s -> 15872.32s]  No message.
[15872.32s -> 15873.60s]  Just 10 dollars.
[15873.60s -> 15874.00s]  Thank you.
[15876.53s -> 15878.61s]  Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the 250.
[15878.61s -> 15880.69s]  All these characters in the hierarchy are real.
[15881.41s -> 15883.73s]  Jacques-Louis David was a world-renowned artist
[15883.73s -> 15885.57s]  who operated during the revolution.
[15885.57s -> 15887.41s]  He made some of the most famous art pieces
[15887.41s -> 15889.17s]  of the period like this one.
[15892.20s -> 15895.92s]  Oh, this is Jacques-Louis David, Bonaparte,
[15896.48s -> 15898.64s]  Francis Le Grand, St. Bernard.
[15899.28s -> 15900.85s]  Google Art.
[15900.85s -> 15902.15s]  Okay.
[15902.15s -> 15906.20s]  Oh, he made this?
[15914.45s -> 15917.25s]  That's the guy who made the famous
[15917.25s -> 15919.56s]  rearing Napoleon painting.
[15919.56s -> 15920.52s]  That's cool.
[15920.52s -> 15922.21s]  Didn't know that.
[15922.21s -> 15923.33s]  It's a very educational game.
[15923.97s -> 15926.26s]  Thank you, Smelly Boy.
[15928.61s -> 15930.05s]  Thank you, Dork Cube, for the 250.
[15930.05s -> 15933.25s]  You say 10 straight hours as if it's an amazing feat.
[15933.25s -> 15935.25s]  But at this point, nine or 10 hour streams
[15935.25s -> 15937.97s]  are common for you when you got to read bits for hours.
[15939.25s -> 15942.29s]  Yeah, but that hasn't happened that very recently, no.
[15944.20s -> 15947.16s]  All the streams recently since that the 250 change.
[15948.88s -> 15950.64s]  The end of the streams have not been that long.
[15952.00s -> 15954.24s]  They've been maybe 30 to 40 minutes each.
[15956.13s -> 15956.69s]  Not anymore.
[15957.33s -> 15961.04s]  A nine to 10 hour stream is really like
[15961.04s -> 15964.88s]  has been recently a nine, an eight to nine plus hour stream.
[15966.00s -> 15974.42s]  Remember when he only streamed for like three or four hours?
[15975.30s -> 15977.54s]  Yeah, I do.
[15978.26s -> 15984.93s]  A few years ago.
[15984.93s -> 15986.61s]  A couple years ago is really what it was.
[15987.72s -> 15990.76s]  A five, a four to five hour stream like two or three years ago was
[15992.53s -> 15993.81s]  that was a long stream for me.
[15996.52s -> 15998.95s]  But also I was so not used to that.
[15998.95s -> 15999.67s]  That's another thing.
[16000.95s -> 16002.63s]  Remember, I was making YouTube videos.
[16003.19s -> 16006.87s]  I wasn't just broadcasting straight for four, five, six, seven, eight, nine hours.
[16007.75s -> 16013.30s]  It took a long time really for me to really understand how to
[16014.26s -> 16021.81s]  limit myself energy wise and because what I would I would just blow out for like an hour or two.
[16021.81s -> 16023.01s]  And sometimes I still do that.
[16023.89s -> 16027.81s]  But sometimes I'll just blow out for two or three straight hours and then just be exhausted.
[16028.53s -> 16033.44s]  But I've learned sort of how to keep my energy levels up
[16034.24s -> 16036.80s]  to a point where I'm not just blown out after three hours.
[16049.36s -> 16051.68s]  Somebody said Vinny streams are like three hours max,
[16052.24s -> 16053.84s]  but he also streams almost every day.
[16054.80s -> 16056.48s]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of ways to do it.
[16056.96s -> 16060.56s]  There's a lot of ways to I know there are people aren't the people that
[16060.56s -> 16064.16s]  will stream for like three, two or three hours and then they'll take a break
[16064.16s -> 16066.56s]  and then come back in the night time and do another three or four hours.
[16067.52s -> 16068.24s]  People do that.
[16077.19s -> 16079.03s]  So, I mean, everybody is different.
[16080.12s -> 16087.52s]  And I've found over the years that if, you know, I give myself a day or two off,
[16087.52s -> 16090.00s]  a couple days off here or there, once a, you know, once a week,
[16090.00s -> 16091.12s]  take like two or three days off,
[16092.08s -> 16097.12s]  then I can usually sit here for more than five to six, maybe sometimes 10 hours.
[16097.76s -> 16099.60s]  It's taken me a long time to figure out how to do that
[16100.32s -> 16101.97s]  and be comfortable doing it.
[16104.77s -> 16106.61s]  Stream for five minutes every half hour.
[16107.97s -> 16109.49s]  You would get unfollowed in a second.
[16110.37s -> 16114.84s]  But thank you, Dorkcube for the 250.
[16114.84s -> 16116.44s]  You say 10 hours straight.
[16116.44s -> 16117.32s]  That was Dorkcube.
[16117.32s -> 16126.24s]  I don't even know if I said your name, but thank you.
[16128.58s -> 16129.62s]  Yeah, CoreMonster.
[16130.34s -> 16134.66s]  CoreMonster gave a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars and two cents.
[16137.54s -> 16138.50s]  Thank you, CoreMonster.
[16139.97s -> 16141.01s]  It's a shitload of money.
[16141.01s -> 16143.09s]  We touched upon it already, but it's fucking a lot.
[16143.09s -> 16143.49s]  Thank you.
[16150.55s -> 16151.19s]  Yeah, nothing.
[16151.19s -> 16152.55s]  I don't have any other issues though.
[16153.84s -> 16156.32s]  I don't have, you know, my head doesn't hurt.
[16156.32s -> 16157.52s]  I don't have a stuffy nose.
[16158.87s -> 16162.55s]  I just have this irritated throat and like an annoying
[16163.43s -> 16165.67s]  cough that originates down here in my chest somewhere.
[16166.55s -> 16168.71s]  So here's the shitty part about that.
[16170.21s -> 16172.29s]  If I, if this doesn't go away in a few days,
[16172.29s -> 16173.81s]  I'm probably going to have to go to the doctor
[16173.81s -> 16176.93s]  because like chest cough is, you don't, you want to take care of that.
[16177.97s -> 16188.28s]  So it's just like throat down into the down here.
[16191.33s -> 16192.85s]  But I'm fine.
[16192.85s -> 16193.97s]  I just have a cough.
[16193.97s -> 16195.33s]  It's not a problem.
[16195.33s -> 16197.11s]  And if it becomes an issue, I'll take care of it.
[16197.11s -> 16197.99s]  That's all there is to it.
[16201.84s -> 16202.40s]  No shirt.
[16202.40s -> 16205.28s]  Yeah, I just proved to everybody that I don't have a shirt on.
[16205.92s -> 16207.72s]  That's all it took.
[16209.08s -> 16210.28s]  I love how somebody just said that.
[16211.16s -> 16211.88s]  No shirt.
[16213.65s -> 16213.89s]  No.
[16217.24s -> 16219.48s]  Nintendo tried to sue you recently.
[16219.48s -> 16221.16s]  Who fucking made up that bullshit?
[16222.76s -> 16224.20s]  Nintendo tried to sue me?
[16228.87s -> 16229.99s]  Give me a source on that.
[16232.68s -> 16235.80s]  Hey blue comet, thanks for the $23 blue comet.
[16235.80s -> 16237.04s]  Here's some bits, Jerma.
[16237.04s -> 16239.04s]  Thanks for being so entertaining and funny, Jerma Hart.
[16239.68s -> 16242.32s]  Thanks for paying me a shitload of money
[16242.32s -> 16244.32s]  and watching the stream and being part of the community.
[16244.32s -> 16244.64s]  Thank you.
[16249.62s -> 16251.20s]  That means an absolute fuck time.
[16251.20s -> 16251.84s]  Thank you so much.
[16254.66s -> 16256.02s]  Dr. Pepper, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[16256.02s -> 16256.66s]  Have some bits.
[16256.66s -> 16258.02s]  You deserve it, girlfriend.
[16258.66s -> 16260.02s]  Thank you, Dr. Pepper.
[16260.02s -> 16261.38s]  For the $10.
[16266.05s -> 16266.85s]  Really appreciate it.
[16267.49s -> 16271.70s]  I'm honored that you think I deserve your money.
[16272.26s -> 16274.77s]  Did I talk to Skrillex yet?
[16274.77s -> 16275.27s]  No.
[16275.97s -> 16278.55s]  No, I did not.
[16279.99s -> 16281.59s]  Hey man boy, thanks for the $250.
[16281.59s -> 16285.03s]  Hey Jerma, Nintendo tweeted out a video showcasing Labo VR.
[16285.03s -> 16286.39s]  It's seven minutes long.
[16287.03s -> 16288.55s]  So you should watch it on your own time.
[16288.55s -> 16290.55s]  Too bad it probably won't be good for streaming.
[16291.83s -> 16295.52s]  That's what everybody said about the other Labo streams,
[16295.52s -> 16297.28s]  but that's not going to stop me from streaming it.
[16300.08s -> 16302.24s]  I'm going to stream Labo VR.
[16303.04s -> 16304.61s]  That is a promise.
[16305.81s -> 16306.77s]  Why would I not do that?
[16307.41s -> 16313.70s]  You have to put the switch on your head.
[16314.42s -> 16316.18s]  Well, it's switch on head or pre-recorded.
[16316.18s -> 16316.98s]  I can make that joke.
[16317.86s -> 16321.00s]  Don't clip that or anything.
[16321.00s -> 16322.76s]  I want to be able to say that on that stream.
[16323.32s -> 16327.04s]  But thank you, man boy, for your $250 again.
[16327.04s -> 16328.24s]  They forgot to link.
[16328.24s -> 16331.06s]  I will definitely take a look at this.
[16331.06s -> 16332.50s]  But thank you for the $5, man boy.
[16334.34s -> 16336.18s]  And then Dorkcube, thanks for the $250.
[16336.18s -> 16336.98s]  Get well soon, friend.
[16336.98s -> 16339.06s]  I can't wait to see you play Sekiro tomorrow
[16339.06s -> 16341.38s]  and die to this game's version of Pinwheel.
[16342.34s -> 16343.94s]  Now, but nobody knows who that version is.
[16343.94s -> 16345.46s]  Nobody knows anything about Pinwheel.
[16348.56s -> 16349.84s]  I don't know and you don't know.
[16349.84s -> 16352.16s]  So even if I do die to Pinwheel tomorrow,
[16352.16s -> 16354.24s]  you're not going to know that for like another couple of weeks
[16354.24s -> 16354.96s]  and then you'll forget.
[16359.52s -> 16371.46s]  Repaired joke.
[16371.54s -> 16372.34s]  Somebody just clipped it.
[16372.34s -> 16373.62s]  I just told you not to.
[16374.26s -> 16376.21s]  Oh my God, he did the thing.
[16378.29s -> 16381.46s]  Oh, switch on head.
[16383.67s -> 16384.47s]  Oh my goodness.
[16386.02s -> 16388.96s]  All right, let's roll the credits.
[16394.28s -> 16396.68s]  Let's see the subs and resubs tonight.
[16398.45s -> 16400.44s]  A lot, a lot.
[16400.44s -> 16402.04s]  A lot of people subbed and resubbed today
[16403.40s -> 16404.28s]  and gone for a while.
[16404.28s -> 16405.24s]  So thank you, guys.
[16405.88s -> 16409.60s]  German with the credits music.
[16409.60s -> 16413.75s]  What? The music's on?
[16413.75s -> 16417.49s]  What's your opinion of the French Revolution?
[16419.30s -> 16419.78s]  It happened.
[16420.42s -> 16426.10s]  Started watching your Stardew stream while working and it's cozy.
[16427.60s -> 16430.66s]  Yeah, that's a cozy game.
[16431.54s -> 16435.24s]  I can't wait to check out that multiplayer, right?
[16435.24s -> 16442.85s]  What's that burger restaurant in Vegas called?
[16442.85s -> 16443.81s]  They're going to be in Vegas tomorrow.
[16443.81s -> 16445.33s]  I want to go to their hash house at Gogo.
[16447.51s -> 16448.39s]  It's at the link.
[16450.05s -> 16451.81s]  You can, you can put the stamp of it.
[16451.81s -> 16453.73s]  You can wear a t-shirt that says,
[16453.73s -> 16456.93s]  German985 said this was the best restaurant in Las Vegas.
[16459.01s -> 16462.69s]  The burger from, they do a stuffed burger.
[16463.41s -> 16467.03s]  They do, it's a specialty from hash house at Gogo in the link.
[16468.07s -> 16471.35s]  Is probably the best fucking restaurant in Las Vegas.
[16472.55s -> 16473.46s]  There it is.
[16484.42s -> 16484.98s]  Sponsor.
[16484.98s -> 16485.78s]  Nope.
[16485.78s -> 16487.22s]  They just got the best burger in town.
[16487.94s -> 16491.19s]  Did you really die to pinwheel?
[16491.19s -> 16491.43s]  No.
[16492.58s -> 16494.74s]  That is a, what they call a funny joke
[16495.46s -> 16498.36s]  that the community has kept going,
[16499.92s -> 16503.12s]  you know, to crawl under my skin and say it and I get really angry
[16503.12s -> 16504.48s]  and I say, yeah, I didn't do that.
[16505.28s -> 16512.05s]  Never had the Gordon Ramsay burger.
[16512.05s -> 16515.49s]  I've been to Gordon Ramsay's steak, which was incredible.
[16516.29s -> 16521.60s]  That's the thing about Vegas.
[16522.80s -> 16527.36s]  There are hundreds and hundreds of amazing restaurants.
[16527.36s -> 16528.56s]  You kind of just have to pick one.
[16529.12s -> 16534.71s]  This is the guy that beat, yeah.
[16534.71s -> 16535.27s]  So, all right.
[16535.27s -> 16537.27s]  So I, I beat flame lurker first try.
[16539.38s -> 16540.74s]  Let's go over this real quick.
[16540.74s -> 16542.50s]  Flame lurker first try from Demon's Souls.
[16543.22s -> 16543.62s]  Blind.
[16545.04s -> 16547.92s]  We got champion gun deer first try.
[16547.92s -> 16548.96s]  Dancer first try.
[16549.68s -> 16550.48s]  Who else?
[16550.48s -> 16552.24s]  Because I want people to understand that
[16552.24s -> 16553.84s]  that's going to happen over the next couple of days.
[16553.84s -> 16556.24s]  I'm going to first try a hard boss over the next few days
[16557.49s -> 16559.83s]  and everybody is going to remember it.
[16559.83s -> 16561.43s]  God, I'm going to make sure I talk about just as much
[16561.43s -> 16562.31s]  I talk about the other ones.
[16563.19s -> 16567.64s]  Well, no, Jevil's not from software related.
[16567.64s -> 16568.68s]  I'm talking from software here.
[16572.39s -> 16573.51s]  Gwyn first try too.
[16573.51s -> 16573.75s]  Yeah.
[16574.47s -> 16581.44s]  Any new stream starting soon or BRB overcards
[16581.44s -> 16582.80s]  you mentioned sometime before you're going to be?
[16582.80s -> 16583.36s]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[16584.32s -> 16587.72s]  I've just been away from the computer
[16587.72s -> 16590.76s]  so I haven't really had a chance to get in touch with Blordel.
[16591.08s -> 16592.44s]  But it's going to happen.
[16593.72s -> 16595.48s]  I've been not here for about a week so.
[16598.36s -> 16601.00s]  Are socks feet gloves or are gloves hand socks?
[16603.14s -> 16604.66s]  They're made out of like cotton.
[16604.66s -> 16605.38s]  That's it.
[16605.38s -> 16606.10s]  They could go anywhere.
[16606.10s -> 16609.62s]  You can put cotton like on your penis
[16610.84s -> 16612.04s]  and it's just cotton.
[16613.16s -> 16614.79s]  I don't know why I said that
[16614.79s -> 16616.79s]  but that's pretty much where we're going to end.
[16619.57s -> 16620.93s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[16620.93s -> 16621.41s]  See you soon.
[16621.41s -> 16621.97s]  See you tomorrow.
[16628.10s -> 16631.54s]  Are you going to make any more E-Bots?
[16631.54s -> 16632.26s]  Uh, yes.
[16635.16s -> 16637.32s]  Like that one, I don't know why that was the first.
[16637.32s -> 16638.36s]  I could have said like fingers
[16638.36s -> 16639.32s]  but that would just be gloves.
[16640.20s -> 16643.73s]  Anywho, I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sekiro.
[16645.64s -> 16646.52s]  Yeah, I ended early.
[16646.52s -> 16647.72s]  Who's streaming right now?
[16647.72s -> 16649.41s]  We got any streamers right now?
[16650.13s -> 16655.46s]  Okay, we've got who's live?
[16655.46s -> 16655.94s]  I don't know.
[16655.94s -> 16657.06s]  Why is it taking so long to load?
[16659.11s -> 16662.98s]  Let's run on Twitch.
[16664.10s -> 16665.08s]  Twitch, what are you doing?
[16667.99s -> 16670.37s]  What the hell was that?
[16671.01s -> 16671.97s]  Does it lose internet?
[16674.04s -> 16674.76s]  All right, we got...
[16676.20s -> 16677.72s]  What are people playing?
[16685.72s -> 16687.00s]  Vinny's playing Devil May Cry.
[16688.74s -> 16691.70s]  Joel's playing a game called Bad Smell.
[16691.70s -> 16692.58s]  What the fuck is that?
[16694.69s -> 16695.73s]  Nova's just hanging out.
[16697.49s -> 16700.37s]  Kiwo is playing, doing GTRP I assume.
[16701.09s -> 16711.01s]  Kraken's playing Sekiro.
[16711.01s -> 16712.13s]  Well, then we don't want to rate him
[16712.13s -> 16714.45s]  because I want you to watch my Sekiro stream.
[16718.66s -> 16724.21s]  Uh, yeah, let's rate Kiwo.
[16724.85s -> 16729.59s]  We rated Kraken a few days ago
[16729.59s -> 16731.67s]  and we rated Vinny like a few days before that.
[16731.67s -> 16732.39s]  Let's rate Kiwo.
[16733.19s -> 16733.83s]  Go say hello.
[16734.63s -> 16738.02s]  And I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sekiro.
[16738.58s -> 16741.64s]  Have a great one.
[16741.64s -> 16747.30s]  Go to my channel page here.
[16747.94s -> 16752.28s]  So here we go.
[16753.00s -> 16755.11s]  Bingo.
[16756.90s -> 16758.50s]  Ready to raid GTRP.
[16758.50s -> 16759.14s]  Hope you enjoy it.
[16763.16s -> 16764.44s]  You don't know who that is.
[16764.44s -> 16766.20s]  She's a very funny, talented person.
[16766.84s -> 16769.78s]  Go say hello.
[16771.60s -> 16772.24s]  Take care, guys.
[16772.88s -> 16773.94s]  See you tomorrow.
[16773.94s -> 16778.55s]  Oh, I missed right at the end here.
[16778.55s -> 16779.91s]  Hey, bath bath, five bucks.
[16779.91s -> 16780.79s]  Thanks for the five bucks.
[16781.43s -> 16782.79s]  And it's all another birthday as well.
[16782.79s -> 16783.75s]  So happy birthday.
[16783.75s -> 16784.63s]  I want to make sure I caught that.
[16784.63s -> 16785.11s]  I didn't see it.
[16786.23s -> 16787.59s]  Happy birthday to the bath bath as well.
[16788.31s -> 16790.15s]  And happy birthday to the rumor.
[16791.62s -> 16792.74s]  See you guys tomorrow.
