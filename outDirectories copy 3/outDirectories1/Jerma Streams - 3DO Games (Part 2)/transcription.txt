[0.38s -> 8.09s]  Good afternoon. What's going on everybody? How are you?
[8.09s -> 16.95s]  Uh, right when I press the unmute button, there's a hundred community subs from an anonymous gifter.
[16.95s -> 21.59s]  An anonymous person just gave, uh, like a trillion dollars worth of money.
[21.59s -> 31.14s]  A hundred fucking community subs. Thank you for the hundred community subs.
[31.14s -> 34.02s]  If you missed the interview, that was fun.
[34.02s -> 38.98s]  I don't typically do stuff like that, but it was a really good time.
[39.14s -> 44.41s]  Tyler's a really good dude. We've, that was a plan for like the last year.
[46.87s -> 51.43s]  So there was a year in the making just about, or at least like six or seven months.
[51.43s -> 56.73s]  It's on Valve News Network right now, if you haven't seen it.
[57.53s -> 62.36s]  We go over deep shit. Like what my first name is.
[62.36s -> 68.78s]  Never heard that one before. But hello, I am back.
[69.50s -> 75.24s]  After another absence, I seem to be taking more absences than streaming these days.
[75.80s -> 78.34s]  And I do apologize for that, but you know,
[79.74s -> 84.38s]  shit, you got to deal with shit half shit happens, right? You got life happens, right?
[84.38s -> 94.12s]  So we were making a return to the 3DO. I was going to do two 3DO days in a row.
[94.12s -> 96.68s]  I did one and then I took off for a week.
[98.70s -> 104.28s]  But I'm here now. Good to go. Excited because the game we're about to play
[105.80s -> 110.76s]  is a game that this is like, what's the, this is going to suck because I'm going to say this.
[110.76s -> 115.00s]  And then everyone's going to be including me is going to be pissed off when this is the worst
[115.00s -> 117.96s]  game of the entire lot. Cause this is why I got the 3DO.
[119.16s -> 123.85s]  The next three games that you're going to see are the reason why I got this thing.
[123.85s -> 126.94s]  So let's hope they're okay.
[130.54s -> 134.62s]  An absolute shitload of community subs are coming in right now and I am going to address them.
[135.70s -> 136.58s]  Oh, that's a lot.
[137.48s -> 143.64s]  Non-descript civilian 10, John Cena is kill five, IA Elliot five, non-descript another 10,
[144.44s -> 150.28s]  Jamie two, eight, oh three, five, seven from nocturne, six from mystic quests,
[150.28s -> 160.97s]  and then $50 from Dupa, 5,000 bits. Thank you guys for the extreme amount of money.
[160.97s -> 166.42s]  It's, I hope I use it well. I really do. I say that a lot, but I really mean it.
[166.42s -> 174.70s]  Is it going to play plumbers without ties? I don't know. Maybe, maybe I'll have like a porn day.
[175.26s -> 181.70s]  I'm not, that's no, we're not going to do a porn day, but you know what I mean? We'll do like a
[186.90s -> 194.94s]  porn day. Hey, 3DO week, PS1 week. Oh, PS2 classics. My favorite porn videos.
[195.50s -> 208.62s]  I don't think that would go over very well. Porn day. Yeah. All of my favorite,
[208.62s -> 215.96s]  it would only fit in one day, right guys? Who the fuck are we kidding? Don't even try to kid
[215.96s -> 224.54s]  yourself either. A porn day? No, take like three weeks. Oh, porn day. Sure. Nice lie.
[225.18s -> 232.76s]  I just punched the microphone accidentally too. All right. Are you ready to do this?
[233.32s -> 237.88s]  Are we ready to get another hundred community subs? This is ridiculous. There's no reason for
[237.88s -> 244.71s]  this. There's no reason for this. You guys are giving me too much money. A hundred more community
[244.71s -> 264.33s]  subs from PQR? That's another hundred. That's too many. That is 100 too many, but I will gladly
[264.33s -> 271.93s]  take it and say thank you. That's an extreme amount of money. You spent $500. Do that. That's
[271.93s -> 280.10s]  a lot of fucking money. Let's move over to the game because I am ready for it. There it is.
[280.10s -> 288.39s]  Jurassic Park Interactive. This is going to be just as fun as the ride that's at Universal Studios
[288.39s -> 295.88s]  and the ride is not very good. So hopefully this is okay. It's the same ride. I think I actually
[295.88s -> 302.02s]  think it's just the ride on a disc and I'm starting to realize that right now, but no way.
[302.42s -> 307.62s]  The back of the box does not show that at all. We're getting so many community subs. I can't
[307.62s -> 317.16s]  even keep up with them. This is fucking crazy. AGB Clown 10, Obstinarwhal 6, Technic Stars 5,
[317.16s -> 329.61s]  Philip Rivers 10, Crank Elm 5, Habbie 5, Little Hat 5, Ink Cat 5. This is too much money. You guys
[329.61s -> 334.25s]  are spoiling me. You don't need to do this. It's okay. I really appreciate it though. Thank you,
[334.25s -> 345.03s]  everybody. Jurassic Park Interactive. Here we go. Do I do normal, intermediate, or advanced?
[345.03s -> 355.02s]  It's not going to be advanced. It's going to be A or B. It's just going to be A, right?
[355.02s -> 369.58s]  I can't do advanced. I'll do B. B sounds fine. You ready? Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait till
[369.58s -> 376.44s]  Jon Hamm shows up and tells me about what we have to do. What's his name? Hammond, Hammond,
[376.44s -> 392.39s]  Hammond, Hammond. That's his name, right? What do we do? Okay. Security systems, animal systems,
[392.39s -> 399.98s]  engineering, security systems, security systems. That's Jon Hamm. Select tracking location.
[399.98s -> 411.62s]  Who is this? Dr. Ellie Sattler, Dr. Alan Grant, Robert Muldoon. Oh shit. These are
[411.62s -> 419.34s]  breakfast cereal actors for the actual actors, aren't they? Oh no. Dr. Ian Malcolm. Select
[419.34s -> 426.81s]  destination. Oh shit. Okay. Is that supposed to be me? All right. We're going to go to the
[427.61s -> 450.41s]  Brachiosaurus pen. What? What was that? Malcolm is surrounded by spitters. Help him out of the
[450.41s -> 464.49s]  jungle. You have a taser weapon. Charge it wisely. It has... What the fuck? How do I move? Oh shit.
[465.45s -> 475.61s]  All right. I got to charge this up and shoot it. Why did he run in here? What was the point?
[476.57s -> 493.99s]  My health. I think I'm going to die. There was some team rockets right there. Okay.
[497.75s -> 515.99s]  No. The screen's going black. I'm dead. Sorry. You did not make it. There may be more stranded
[515.99s -> 524.90s]  guests and staff. Check your computer. What is Malcolm dead? All right. What about... Hold on.
[524.90s -> 531.90s]  Animal systems. Animal systems. Select tracking location. Holy shit. This is a large game.
[532.54s -> 541.51s]  Okay. Wait. We're going to find my favorite dinosaur. That could be me in the costume.
[541.51s -> 551.98s]  We have to see. All right. Velociraptor. Let's go. Animal tracking. All right. So the
[551.98s -> 559.77s]  Velociraptor is here. Okay. So let's go to security systems. Security systems. Select
[559.77s -> 565.77s]  tracking location. Here we go. Okay. Tim and Lex. Don't put the kids in with the Velociraptor.
[565.77s -> 576.71s]  Select destination. A Raptor pen? Displaying video. Why am I putting kids in a... Am I playing
[576.71s -> 587.14s]  roller coaster tycoon or like planet zoo? What am I doing? I don't get it. Lex and Tim are trapped
[587.14s -> 591.62s]  in a park building. Help them find their way out. You will need to find the keys to get through the
[591.62s -> 601.38s]  locked doors. Raptors are here. Is this an FPS now? Are the kids with me? Okay. This is actually kind
[601.38s -> 625.91s]  of fucking scary. Do I have a punch? Okay. But what am I supposed to do? Is he chasing me?
[627.03s -> 633.61s]  He's not very fast. Okay. So let's just keep going. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. There's only
[633.61s -> 644.74s]  one, right? What happens if he touches you? Do you get killed? Lock five. Lock six. I have one key.
[645.38s -> 662.78s]  Oh shit. There's the... I got to make this a little suspenseful. Does he not care anymore? Oh,
[662.78s -> 676.95s]  fuck it. Didn't work. I couldn't open the door. Okay. That's really, that's clearly a guy in a
[676.95s -> 683.77s]  mask. That's great. That was just a guy in a mask. That was a guy in a mask from like Spirit of
[683.77s -> 689.85s]  Halloween. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sensor registers no life signs.
[689.85s -> 695.82s]  Oh, there he is. Jon Hamm. Select destination. Jon Hamm. Let's go to... Let's go to your house
[695.82s -> 711.40s]  and just hang out. Displaying video. Camera malfunction. Uh-oh. Hammond is trapped in a
[711.40s -> 715.56s]  park building. Help him find his way out. You need to find the keys. Oh, give me a break.
[715.56s -> 721.10s]  You will need to find the keys to get through. All right. They all locked in these weird, like,
[722.79s -> 731.00s]  hostile dungeons. But where do I find the keys? I don't want to do this. Is it... Wait. I hope to
[731.00s -> 736.15s]  God it's not a raptor. I hope it's another bitmap image of another dinosaur. It's better not be
[736.15s -> 749.06s]  a velociraptor. All right. Hold on. Oh shit. There we go. Maintenance area. The fuck just happened?
[753.46s -> 761.51s]  What? You open the... I have to close the door? Everyone's gonna die. Literally no one's gonna
[761.51s -> 768.17s]  make it out alive. No one's gonna make it out. Shit. The ride is more fun than this. Oh no.
[768.17s -> 774.89s]  What have I done? The ride is way more fun. All right. Engineering. Engineering systems.
[774.89s -> 780.36s]  Engineering systems locked out. What do you mean locked out? What are you talking about? Security.
[780.36s -> 790.74s]  Level one security. Access permitted. Okay. What does that get me? It's a music player?
[797.43s -> 800.95s]  Okay. You must score 20,000 points to enter the next security level.
[801.59s -> 811.88s]  That's not even a spitter. That's a gremlin. This... Am I hacking the game? What's supposed
[811.88s -> 822.41s]  to be hacking the computer? Like Newman does, right? I'll be... I'm gonna... Actually, I'll be...
[822.41s -> 828.65s]  What do I need? 10,000? 20,000 points? I'll get it. This is the shit that the guy at the security
[828.65s -> 834.41s]  system is doing. No. This is not unlocking security shit. This is what the security guard is doing.
[834.41s -> 854.87s]  He's on miniclip.com all day. All right. 10,000? What is it? 20,000? Who's the guy? Is that
[854.87s -> 860.22s]  supposed to be Newman? That's supposed to be Newman, right? Whatever his name is in the
[860.30s -> 871.38s]  universal dress park. What is it? I really hope security clearance two is not this again,
[871.38s -> 884.94s]  but with other pictures. He's the best security in the world. Could be better. Okay. 20,000 is
[884.94s -> 889.38s]  coming. You can still shoot when you're dead, by the way. Now, that's the real glitch way to win.
[891.99s -> 899.34s]  20,000. Okay. So, should I just die? Just let the things kill me because I get to 20,000?
[899.34s -> 914.30s]  What the... All right. Just kill me. I got to 20,000. It's 30,000? It's 30,000 points? Oh,
[914.30s -> 918.14s]  my God. Thank God. No, no, no. I can't die here. Okay. Actually, I'm going to stick the fuck up
[918.14s -> 930.78s]  and play well. I don't want to die. I'll get it here, right? I'll get it right here.
[937.56s -> 943.88s]  I did it. Level two. Level two security. Access permitted. Yeah, I got level two access.
[945.72s -> 950.79s]  You unlocked Winnie the Pooh Baseball. Oh, it actually is Winnie the Pooh. It's just
[950.79s -> 956.86s]  Flashgate. Okay. All right. 20,000. You know, I'm going to do it because why not?
[962.97s -> 969.10s]  Gallagher. It's actually kind of fun, though. All right. I'm curious. I want to sit here for a
[969.10s -> 991.38s]  little bit. Chex quest? It's hard to dodge that. The screen's tiny. Please stop. No, not yet. I
[991.38s -> 996.22s]  have to get to level... I got to get security clearance level five. And then after security
[996.22s -> 1003.64s]  clearance level five, I'll open John Hamm's door. I'll at least save... I got to save one person.
[1004.20s -> 1013.85s]  Okay. The back of the CD has like you riding in a car and the T-Rex chasing you. Spoilers,
[1013.85s -> 1017.93s]  but this franchise is like 25 years old at this point. How do I do that?
[1019.05s -> 1025.74s]  Did it. Okay. All right. Move up to level three. Why is he a pirate now?
[1029.10s -> 1035.86s]  Level three security. Access permitted. What am I doing this for? I don't know what I'm doing it
[1035.86s -> 1051.59s]  for. I'm playing Ong versus a dinosaur. I don't want to do this one. I like don't actually want
[1051.59s -> 1065.82s]  to play this one. Wait, why is it just turning into the guy from dinosaurs, the TV show? Remember
[1065.82s -> 1075.83s]  that show? It was like the Muppets. They were the big puppet dinosaur things. Didn't that show end
[1075.83s -> 1081.19s]  really horribly, too? Like a fucking meteor hit the earth or something at the end of the last
[1081.19s -> 1089.08s]  episode? Something horrible, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, something horrible did happen.
[1095.21s -> 1107.90s]  That's really fucked up. I still love the baby. The baby was the best. By the way, every single
[1107.90s -> 1114.26s]  family oriented cartoon with a family of people was all based on dinosaurs. Family guy,
[1115.50s -> 1121.62s]  Simpsons. They all came after dinosaurs. The big fat, the big fat dad who's kind of dumb,
[1121.62s -> 1127.14s]  but he means well. The baby, that kid has magical powers and is funny and is sinister.
[1129.03s -> 1142.44s]  Simpsons fucking copy dinosaurs. I just lose. I got 20,000 Flintstones. Oh, they got inspiration
[1142.44s -> 1161.86s]  from the Flintstones, not the other way around. It's a woke take. I don't want to play anymore.
[1161.86s -> 1173.83s]  Just let me just get the security level five. I'm trying to lose. Hold on. This is even the
[1173.83s -> 1181.53s]  dinosaurs theme song. This is the shit that plays when the big dinosaur guy is driving his car to
[1181.53s -> 1200.02s]  work. Okay. Security level five. I'm going to do this. Level four security access permitted.
[1200.02s -> 1206.54s]  Do the baby impression. And the baby kind of loved me. Then I do a poop in my pants.
[1207.50s -> 1210.86s]  Something like that, right? You might actually think I'm making that part up. He actually says
[1210.86s -> 1226.49s]  that part. He actually says what I just said. I didn't read this. Oh shit. Yeah. Let's respect
[1226.49s -> 1251.10s]  nature and the dinosaurs. Arm the laser cannon and shoot them. All right. What is the 20,000?
[1253.30s -> 1270.50s]  Spawn cam, spawn cam, spawn cam. Fix it. Fucking Activision. Fucking idiots. Did I do my good,
[1270.50s -> 1280.23s]  like fake, like pissed off thing? You guys like that? Did you like it? Why move? I got this all
[1280.23s -> 1292.34s]  wrong. Why move at all? I think they just keep spawning. Yeah. This sort of reminds me of what
[1292.34s -> 1300.14s]  a really over enthusiastic history teacher would do. Like a science teacher. This is like an
[1300.14s -> 1304.46s]  over enthusiastic science teacher's little side project that the kids get to play for like 15
[1304.46s -> 1313.58s]  minutes at the end of class. And although you don't think it's very fun, you don't have to
[1313.58s -> 1336.36s]  listen to him talk. So this is the alternative and it's better. This game probably took dozens
[1336.36s -> 1343.27s]  of people to make. Yeah. The 3DO is awesome. I love this thing. I'm going to wrap this thing
[1343.83s -> 1348.33s]  up. I'm going to laminate my 3DO and I'm never touching it ever again after this.
[1358.73s -> 1364.49s]  3DO sucks. No, it doesn't. 3DO is pretty fun. They made this in Microsoft Publisher.
[1367.91s -> 1383.69s]  It's probably made in Adobe director or something. I have to die now. All right. It's fun. What do
[1383.69s -> 1391.03s]  you get for doing this though? That's why I have to do this. Does he know the 3DO sucks? It doesn't
[1391.03s -> 1398.04s]  though. This is fun. Interactive media. All right. Level five. This is it. Security clearance level
[1398.04s -> 1410.86s]  five. Level five security access permitted. What's the number five? Okay. This is wrap attack.
[1417.77s -> 1426.18s]  Oh no. No. The science teacher roped in the math teacher to make their own and showed him how easy
[1426.18s -> 1444.54s]  it was. How are we going to play the same game next period? 20,000. And then what? It's just
[1444.54s -> 1453.40s]  asteroid. What? Horrible. You can die by the fan. What's with the environmental damage? It's not
[1453.40s -> 1463.27s]  cool. NA classes. Don't you guys know what NA classes were? Wheel the TV in, play a movie,
[1463.27s -> 1467.27s]  or look at this cool shitty thing that one of the teachers made and we're all going to exploit for
[1467.27s -> 1473.43s]  the next six weeks? Or get everybody into the gym to sit there and here's an assembly for two hours.
[1474.07s -> 1486.84s]  I don't think we learned anything. I don't think I learned anything. No, no, no. You know, you know,
[1486.84s -> 1490.84s]  I learned how to go to the bathroom really fucking fast because apparently if you took more than one
[1490.84s -> 1495.48s]  minute to go to the bathroom, you were like a terrible student. That's what I learned in an
[1495.48s -> 1501.91s]  NA education. Can I go to the bathroom? Yes, you can. But hurry the fuck up. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'll
[1501.91s -> 1507.77s]  pee pee and it hurts. It hurts. I'm peeing as hard as I can. It hurts. Get out of the bathroom. Oh,
[1508.49s -> 1512.89s]  what are you doing in the hall? I decided to go to the bathroom. Yeah. Prove it. Okay. I'm going
[1512.89s -> 1526.86s]  to go back to class. Get back there. That's what I learned. And then all of a sudden one of the
[1526.86s -> 1534.55s]  exits would open. It's like one of the bad kids. Hey, man, you want to skip class and go to X-Men?
[1537.51s -> 1556.33s]  No, no, I'm okay. Yeah, I do. But no. Did I get level two? This is sick. You are a loser.
[1556.65s -> 1570.90s]  Just shut up. There was always that group that like, and guess what? There were people that I knew
[1571.70s -> 1575.86s]  that weren't like friends with them necessarily, but like you knew some of these people that were
[1575.86s -> 1579.94s]  in like your class or something. They'd walk into class and they would just smell like the bottom
[1579.94s -> 1585.38s]  of a bowl. You know what I mean? Just like, oh, yeah, you must have, okay. All right. That's
[1585.38s -> 1596.95s]  what you were just doing somewhere, I guess. That is a marijuana reference. It's just like,
[1596.95s -> 1604.89s]  oh, yeah. All right. Well, hey, what do you think? Good? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm good. Cool.
[1606.25s -> 1620.94s]  CVD. This actually can't be what NA education is. No, that wasn't the teacher. That was not the
[1620.94s -> 1629.34s]  teacher. The teacher sits down and it smells like weed. Hey, how you doing, kids? Hey, hey,
[1629.34s -> 1638.86s]  you want to go see, hey, fuck this class. You all want to go see X-Men? Who wants to go, hey,
[1638.86s -> 1645.75s]  who wants to go see X-Men? Why does everybody have to turn into Mr. Satan? All right. You do,
[1645.75s -> 1651.53s]  all right. You do know what to do next, do you? No, I don't. Access permitted to all. Oh shit. I
[1651.53s -> 1662.92s]  was supposed to do that. Rebooting systems. What? Alert. I was supposed to do that. That was return
[1662.92s -> 1674.38s]  to priority one command. Return to Isla Nublar priority one command. Will comply. ETA 16 hours.
[1674.38s -> 1679.85s]  Two crewmen lost. And two kids, right? Two kids as well. I know you don't want to take the blame
[1679.85s -> 1688.04s]  for that. But that's what happened. Two kids are dead too. Okay. Is that what I need to do?

[1933.11s -> 1967.43s]  not to have him in my house. You have a taser. Oh my God. Not this shit again. No. How am I
[1967.43s -> 1974.89s]  supposed to kill all these things? All right. He's dead. They're all running into the woods
[1974.89s -> 1988.65s]  and dying because I can't save them. Guess when? I can't. Is there anybody left on the island?
[1988.65s -> 1998.10s]  Should I just leave? This was just a really complicated VR. Okay. Robert Muldoon. This is
[1998.10s -> 2007.16s]  the guy that's like, she's got you. Run. Right? Select destination. All right. What about the

[2059.37s -> 2066.31s]  in the bathroom. Okay. Well, whatever. I'm just going to go here and just run. I'm, he's always
[2066.31s -> 2073.18s]  right behind you. Just go. Run. Walk to, I don't know. Just run. It's high voltage. Drop that on
[2073.18s -> 2078.49s]  him. He'll electrocute him, right? I don't, can I drop it? Oh shit. Nice. Okay. He's going to,
[2078.49s -> 2096.10s]  he'll get killed. He's not going to be right here, is he? Oh shit. It's just a big, drop it, drop it,

[2145.58s -> 2162.68s]  video. There's a lot of people leaving out of this person's room late at night, apparently. There's
[2162.68s -> 2172.39s]  a lot of people leaving. How much footage of people like running away from the house do you have
[2172.39s -> 2182.63s]  here? Already? Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Drive. I have the fucking dinosaur bones in the middle
[2182.63s -> 2196.98s]  of the road. All right. 1.4. 1.3. Okay. I have to drive 1.3 miles. This is going to take forever.
[2203.10s -> 2219.22s]  I have to save one person. I have to save Dr. Ellie. Come on. This is my favorite character.
[2219.86s -> 2225.56s]  When she puts her hand on the Triceratops's belly and says goodbye. Oh, that was such a touching
[2225.56s -> 2234.04s]  moment for us all. What? This is impossible. It's not possible to drive. It's impossible.
[2234.04s -> 2246.81s]  It's not possible. It's impossible. I should have done normal. Okay. Dude, you didn't do very well
[2246.81s -> 2258.46s]  saving people. You did notify the cargo ship in time. Rating Brachius. How did I notify the
[2258.46s -> 2283.59s]  cargo ship? Is that the computer hacking? What's going on? Why did he move? His face just moved.
[2283.59s -> 2298.04s]  His face just moved. Okay. Well, that was Jurassic Park Interactive. It was the science teacher.
[2298.04s -> 2313.96s]  There he was. Okay. Let's move on. Let me just make, let me just take this out. I liked that one.
[2313.96s -> 2324.62s]  It was terrible, but I loved it. Did I miss anything in it? Oh, we saw it all. We saw it all.
[2324.62s -> 2330.30s]  Nothing else to say really. Well, you can, while I get the next CD, you can watch the intro video.
[2330.30s -> 2348.07s]  It's pretty cool. Hey, Kalissa. Coming up next, we have something that I just want to get out of the
[2348.07s -> 2353.59s]  way because I know that it is going to be, it's not going to be very good, but it doesn't matter.
[2354.55s -> 2365.18s]  Next one is called Club 3DO Station Invasion On The Air. This is a, this is like Nickelodeon
[2365.18s -> 2376.74s]  Magazine, the CD. That's how I can describe it, the way it looks. Wait, is this just the actual
[2376.74s -> 2387.46s]  intro to Jurassic Park? I didn't even watch this. Oh yeah. No, no, I know what this is. Yeah.
[2387.46s -> 2393.70s]  This is torrent underscore zero four four two point one zero underscore torrent Jurassic Park
[2394.63s -> 2402.86s]  full movie underscore one one one one underscore two. Jurassic Park, located on an island off the
[2402.86s -> 2408.55s]  coast of Costa Rica, was conceived and built by John Hammond. Hammond, an extremely wealthy
[2408.55s -> 2414.39s]  dinosaur fanatic and his company InGen Corporation, leased the island of Isla Nublar from the
[2414.39s -> 2419.67s]  government. Okay, you already know the story. Let's play Station Invasion Club 3DO. You're going to
[2419.67s -> 2425.94s]  get bars across your screen. Just want to make sure you wear that 3DO just through the way that's
[2425.94s -> 2436.82s]  getting captured. It's going to be like incoming in about three seconds. Three, two, maybe not.
[2436.82s -> 2443.78s]  Just do it. Anyway, I did air. All right, coming up here comes Station Invasion Club 3DO.
[2444.34s -> 2451.29s]  No idea. I don't even know why I got this. In the inside cover, there's a dog with a suit on.
[2451.85s -> 2466.55s]  So, I got high hopes. Show dog. I will. Hold on. Let me just get it in. God, I love this 3DO.
[2467.11s -> 2491.42s]  Let's go. Show auto. No, not right now. He's sleeping behind me. This one's kind of...
[2491.98s -> 2500.52s]  Can you hear that disc chugger? It's going... It's like a PlayStation 3. I almost said 2.
[2501.00s -> 2519.74s]  All right, Club 3DO Station Invasion. Awesome start. Here's at the TV station. Kids.
[2544.81s -> 2556.41s]  Oh, it must have been really fucking failing. It must have been free.
[2571.91s -> 2577.19s]  I know my ratings haven't been that great, Mary Lee, but the babes still dig me, huh?
[2577.91s -> 2580.68s]  He's not talking about... Who is that young man over there?
[2580.68s -> 2584.84s]  Wait, what? That's Jake Smits, the...
[2584.84s -> 2587.56s]  Look at that shoe in there. That is an elaborate fucking shoe.
[2587.56s -> 2594.90s]  Obnoxious little bugger, isn't he? Wait, Mary, don't you want to ask me some more questions?
[2596.02s -> 2601.32s]  Let's do lunch sometime. Okay, now get rid of that guy. No, get rid of that guy.
[2601.32s -> 2612.22s]  Why not? So you're the new president? That I... Do you have any... No, we're going to hire some
[2612.22s -> 2616.70s]  new blood in here. We're going to take the top five shows and put the top producer on each one.
[2616.70s -> 2618.94s]  Am I going to be a producer? These kids will be the best.
[2618.94s -> 2625.22s]  But I'm not a kid. I mean, who knows TV better than us kids?
[2625.22s -> 2631.21s]  That's a good point. How about some new recruits coming in today that look real promising?
[2631.21s -> 2634.01s]  Me. Well, we wish you the best of luck, Jake.
[2634.01s -> 2640.57s]  Thanks, Mary. Maybe we can do lunch sometime? Yeah, that makes more sense.
[2641.53s -> 2649.78s]  Why are they all the same dialogue, though? Why does everything have to end in
[2649.78s -> 2653.78s]  let's do lunch sometime? It's just the writer just didn't care. I always had to end a sentence.
[2659.70s -> 2661.94s]  Even if it was like a 40-year-old talking to an 11-year-old.
[2661.94s -> 2664.58s]  Like, I just looked at lunch sometime. I don't know how to end sentences.
[2672.26s -> 2673.86s]  I love this board. This is awesome.
[2674.82s -> 2677.32s]  It's got a baseball bat, too.
[2692.84s -> 2697.88s]  Abuse adults? Like, just like let's torture adults? The network?
[2697.88s -> 2702.52s]  Hi, I'm Billy Sparks, the star of the sitcom, I'm Grounded. I play a guy,
[2702.60s -> 2707.72s]  also named Billy Sparks, coincidentally, who's always either grounded or getting grounded,
[2707.72s -> 2713.00s]  with the good help of my friend, Igor. I get into a lot of trouble, but it's not my fault.
[2713.00s -> 2717.96s]  I'm just misunderstood. I'm Bryce Banyan, host of the show,
[2717.96s -> 2724.44s]  Mystery Smistries. We answer all life's burning questions. What happened to the missing sock?
[2724.44s -> 2729.56s]  Why is there always one shoe lying at the side of the road? I don't think of Mystery Smistries as a
[2729.56s -> 2734.12s]  show, as much as I think of it as a journey. Okay.
[2738.68s -> 2741.88s]  Do we get to do all these things? Do we have to like play these mini-games or something,
[2741.88s -> 2742.84s]  or do these shows?
[2765.42s -> 2769.02s]  Okay.
[2772.30s -> 2775.66s]  And my new best friend. Okay, this is important. This is the biggest decision of the whole day,
[2775.66s -> 2779.34s]  but I gotta pick my show and my new best friend.
[2783.58s -> 2785.82s]  I think, yeah, Mystery Smistries.
[2789.08s -> 2790.52s]  Too desperate. Way too desperate.
[2790.52s -> 2792.92s]  There's only one show for you, and that's Sundays of Our Lives.
[2792.92s -> 2794.92s]  I'm not a big fan of like Sundays, really.
[2797.88s -> 2800.60s]  Right, okay, yeah, that's to the point and incredibly accurate.
[2804.60s -> 2805.40s]  I like having fun.
[2809.32s -> 2809.88s]  I mean, he's like, okay.
[2817.40s -> 2818.92s]  No, I don't. I don't.
[2820.68s -> 2823.16s]  No, I don't. I don't.
[2823.16s -> 2824.20s]  I don't.
[2824.20s -> 2824.68s]  Mystery.
[2830.34s -> 2831.54s]  Oh, okay, my name is B.
[2834.90s -> 2841.46s]  Up to 10 letters? How much is E?
[2849.98s -> 2857.74s]  This is like freaking me out. I thought that was a Y. All right, let's go. Like difficulty.
[2861.66s -> 2876.65s]  Easy. Or not easy. Easy. This is a game for children, right? This is a game for kids.
[2878.98s -> 2885.22s]  How about hard? This is a good beat. I like this track. I'm gonna pick it by the music.
[2892.98s -> 2902.33s]  What is it? Let's go here. I'm ready to produce my TV show.
[2906.01s -> 2910.17s]  It's up to you. Press A for complete game. Press B for fast game or press C.
[2912.01s -> 2913.37s]  Listen, what is a complete game?
[2915.85s -> 2919.21s]  First week of Kid TV begins. There's a dog with a tie on.
[2921.43s -> 2928.22s]  Mystery Smystery is produced by Jeremy.
[2928.22s -> 2932.54s]  We need a lot of tomato juice for tomorrow's episode on why tomato juice is used to get rid
[2932.54s -> 2936.70s]  of the smell of skunk. We need to figure out how much we need and how much it will cost.
[2936.70s -> 2939.66s]  There's a lot more to do before tomorrow. I didn't pick the smell TV one. I'm actually
[2939.66s -> 2942.86s]  a little irritated about this Mr. Mystery Smystery. I thought we're going to be solving mysteries,
[2942.86s -> 2947.26s]  not smelly puke stuff. Use the joy pad to choose a number block and the A button to rotate it.
[2947.26s -> 2949.66s]  Solve all three problems and press C when done.
[2951.10s -> 2955.02s]  Oh, shit. Wait, is math wrong? Two, seven, uh.
[2962.33s -> 2968.01s]  Twelve, six divided by. Where's the three? No, where's the?
[2975.77s -> 2981.85s]  I didn't lose yet. I need a four. Six, four divided by one divided by four is four. Where's the one?
[2983.45s -> 2987.45s]  Sixteen, four, eight, twelve, sixteen, four, eight, twelve, six. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2988.33s -> 2994.33s]  Eight, eight, twelve, six, twelve. I don't know. Six, seven divided by two, four, six,
[2994.33s -> 2996.49s]  eight, ten, twelve. Okay, now we got thirty-two, thirty-nine.
[2998.41s -> 3002.01s]  Twelve divided by. No, what is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it?
[3002.01s -> 3005.69s]  What is it? What is it? What is it? Twelve? No, no, it's like eight. It's like three. What is it?
[3005.69s -> 3021.69s]  What is it? It's three. Yeah, he's smart as hell. Jeremy gained six points. That would be the
[3021.69s -> 3028.36s]  Ukulaka tribal victory dance. Feel free to join in at any time. How is this a mystery?
[3028.36s -> 3034.28s]  This is doing shitty math problems. It sure was an exciting week for television, don't you think?
[3034.92s -> 3040.55s]  Look at the ratings for the week. Come on, you got to put two human hands up like, like Swedish
[3040.55s -> 3054.84s]  chef style. This is just a, this is Mario Party, but it, this is the twisted game, but with kids.
[3054.84s -> 3059.91s]  Let's look at a clip from one of this week's top shows. All right, here we go.
[3061.51s -> 3072.73s]  People pick their noses when they get in their car. It's not like we can't see them. Why do they
[3072.73s -> 3084.15s]  do it? What luck. We just caught Dak Jones. Not if you have tinted windows. I wasn't picking.
[3084.15s -> 3094.84s]  I had an itch. Isn't a guy allowed to scratch an itch anymore? What's this guy doing over here,
[3094.84s -> 3101.16s]  by the way? I did it. Is that what you want to hear? Yep. I don't think it's that gross.
[3101.88s -> 3105.48s]  Well, we brought a gross meter with us, Dak. Gross meter. Let's just see how your pick score.
[3105.48s -> 3110.44s]  It's a two out of 10. Those meters don't prove anything. No, they don't. They aren't even accepted
[3110.44s -> 3114.36s]  in a court of law. That's bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, no. I disagree. Disagree. That's a one or
[3114.36s -> 3122.02s]  a two out of 10. I hate you. Now if he ate it, it would have been an eight. He didn't though.
[3124.06s -> 3140.06s]  What is that guy? That guy in the background at the newspaper stand is scaring me. He's freaking
[3140.06s -> 3150.01s]  me out. Where are the cue cards? They're all gone. I never remember my lines. You have to help me.
[3150.01s -> 3153.13s]  I know you're not a script writer, but you're going to have to be for today.
[3153.13s -> 3159.10s]  And what does that entail? Let's see. Select each word requested by using the joy pad and the A
[3159.10s -> 3167.64s]  button. These mad libs? I'm pretty good at these. All right. Pick a verb. Verb. Okay. Creepy. Pizza.
[3167.64s -> 3175.88s]  A verb. Smuggles. Scatters. Cleans. Syrupy. Hot. Hot can be a verb, right? How about cleans?
[3175.88s -> 3186.44s]  Clean is a verb. You're cleaning something. Clean. Pick an adjective. Adjective. Stale.
[3186.44s -> 3201.98s]  Pick a verb. Verb. I have one second left. Wow. That wasn't very good, was it?
[3201.98s -> 3208.82s]  I didn't realize there was a timer. Agree, John. This week was fabulous. Look at the ratings.
[3208.82s -> 3218.09s]  You're not even going to bark? You lost it. I thought it was mad libs. I didn't think it was
[3219.45s -> 3234.79s]  actually get it correct. Couldn't agree more. Better be mine. No. I don't want to watch this shit.
[3234.79s -> 3258.46s]  Do you think it's interesting that in the kids TV where they want to get rid of all the adults,
[3258.46s -> 3278.20s]  all the kids just pretend to be adults? It's weird, right? That kid had mustache hair? Yeah,
[3278.20s -> 3286.25s]  good. Mustache hair is going to become a big trend sooner or later and then everyone's going
[3286.25s -> 3294.42s]  to look back and be like, wow, I know where that started. This guy. All right. Now I understand.
[3294.82s -> 3302.28s]  It's vocabulary. The art director quit. She just quit. She says she's not appreciated.
[3302.28s -> 3306.36s]  I'll go have a talk with her. In the meantime, you have to take over. I don't know anything
[3306.36s -> 3312.28s]  about art. Do the best. Neither do I. You're asking the wrong person. All right. Select two
[3312.28s -> 3317.88s]  pieces to exchange using the joy pad and the A button. Press the C button when done. What do
[3317.88s -> 3324.79s]  you mean? George Frederick Handel, water music. Oh, okay. It's one of these.
[3328.47s -> 3331.67s]  George Frederick Michelson, waterbender.
[3342.26s -> 3355.22s]  Get this big ass hair. I don't. George Frederick Handel's water music was performed on a boat for
[3355.22s -> 3362.25s]  King George, the first of England. Nice. We're going to get our show on TV today. What can I
[3362.25s -> 3380.14s]  say? You're the best. Thanks, man. Yes. And it was the same clip twice in a row. That's how you can
[3380.14s -> 3401.37s]  tell it was even better. All right. Let's get, let's see what we got on TV. I thought that was
[3401.37s -> 3416.01s]  funny. You did too. I don't care if it's 11 year olds that I laughed at it. I don't care. Hey,
[3416.01s -> 3419.69s]  how many of you guys used to have contests? So who could throw that fucking exact football
[3419.69s -> 3429.72s]  as far as possible? It didn't even play catch. Wow. That's great. Hey, you want to come up?
[3429.72s -> 3434.60s]  There's a ladder over there. It's just a bunch of fucking eighth graders blow out their arms,
[3434.60s -> 3439.96s]  trying to one up each other. Betty Primrose. Just what do you think you're doing on that ladder?
[3439.96s -> 3448.98s]  What? Hi, Mr. Sparks. Guess what? This is the angry dad. A thousand times and never gets caught.
[3449.78s -> 3457.82s]  Betty has to come over once. Wait. Once. That's the thing that was happening in Jurassic Park.
[3464.66s -> 3477.43s]  A dog. I love that dog. Okay. Fourth week of kid TV season. When do we get canceled?
[3487.67s -> 3492.23s]  On week five. There's some problems that need to be solved. Get to work.
[3492.23s -> 3498.65s]  Okay. What problems? Match an animal with its proper classification by using the joy pad and
[3498.65s -> 3502.81s]  the apron. Oh dear. This is not going to go well. Choose a mammal. Mammal. Okay. Mammal is,
[3503.53s -> 3510.65s]  that's an elephant. Choose an insect. That is a fly. Choose a fish. That is a goldfish.
[3511.69s -> 3516.63s]  Choose an amphibian. That would be a frog. Choose a bird. A bird. That would be a chicken.
[3517.51s -> 3528.28s]  Choose a reptile. Reptile. That would be a turtle. That was easy. That was a very respectable
[3528.28s -> 3535.86s]  performance. Why was I talking as? Why was I talking like that was impressive?
[3542.76s -> 3546.92s]  Billy Madison. I'm like sitting in a third grade class as a 35 year old.
[3546.92s -> 3550.22s]  That's a turtle. I win. I'm smarter than all these children.
[3550.94s -> 3563.34s]  Like Jeremy, we don't win in class. Oh wow. You sure? I do. As usual,
[3563.34s -> 3575.61s]  we follow the ratings chart with a clip. Smarter than a fifth grader.
[3575.69s -> 3582.25s]  Do a Jerma Madison stream. That would take a lot of convincing. Do you understand?
[3593.19s -> 3608.87s]  What's he holding? What the hell is this thing? This is not a real thing, right? Isn't this the
[3609.19s -> 3619.98s]  thing you skipped over? What is this supposed to do? What is that supposed to be doing?
[3632.94s -> 3640.84s]  One by by. We take cash. If it gets lost in the mail, it's not our fault. What the hell was that?
[3641.56s -> 3649.82s]  Did you put a thing around your waist? What was that thing called? Skip it. Skip it. What's the
[3649.82s -> 3654.86s]  song called? The thing that used to trip a bunch of kids. What was that thing called?
[3655.50s -> 3661.56s]  We need a lot of tomato juice for tomorrow's episode on why tomato juice is used to get
[3661.56s -> 3665.40s]  rid of the smell of skunk. We need to figure out how much we need and how much it will cost.
[3665.40s -> 3669.96s]  Yeah, how many of you guys used to cheat with the skip it? You just put the hoop under one
[3669.96s -> 3675.16s]  of your ankles and you spun it as fast as you possibly could to try to get like a thousand
[3675.16s -> 3683.06s]  points by cheating. Oh shit, I went and said, what does three point 45 minus four, I don't know.
[3683.62s -> 3687.14s]  I don't know. The cashier does this for me. I don't do this. They just tell me a number.
[3688.66s -> 3694.78s]  Uh, one, one 20, just three point two, four plus four point two, five plus one.
[3696.04s -> 3703.96s]  That's that would be four, five, six, six, uh, 24, six, seven, uh, seven, six, five.
[3705.00s -> 3712.76s]  What's this three? That's four, three, two, four, six, three, three, six, three, 75.
[3718.62s -> 3722.47s]  Some mysteries are tougher than others. You know that that was a tough one.
[3722.47s -> 3726.28s]  Wasn't even tough. The cashier does that for you. None of you guys could just do that right now.
[3726.28s -> 3736.30s]  Sean, you're just cool. Is there a new gal in your ratings?
[3736.30s -> 3747.45s]  What was that? What is that? That was a big cat puke. Stop pretending. I'm not. I'm just
[3747.45s -> 3755.03s]  hanging out, man. That was a dog puke. Let me roll a slip from one of those shows.
[3755.03s -> 3769.53s]  Oh, that smell. Smell. Shitty TV show. Remember folks, Mr. Slugs is doing this in one whiff.
[3770.36s -> 3784.78s]  You'll never get this one. I'm the champ. I'll get it. What is that stuff? That's disgusting.
[3786.06s -> 3790.78s]  Want one more whiff? It's a fucking. I'm not going near that jar again.
[3792.70s -> 3797.26s]  Mr. Jones, it's your. And she stole a gangrene in his toe.
[3797.26s -> 3799.82s]  That means he was decomposing right on the person's body.
[3800.78s -> 3805.54s]  They had to amputate this guy's toe and my sister stole it.
[3807.40s -> 3809.40s]  There's a lot of wrong with what he was talking about.
[3809.40s -> 3813.24s]  That was super. And John, I'm going to get you to talk about your.
[3813.24s -> 3817.40s]  Way too many things wrong with that. Okay, so you stole somebody's toe from a hospital.
[3818.22s -> 3824.49s]  Okay, that's felony one. Then you put it into a jar. That's serial killer one.
[3825.53s -> 3831.75s]  And then you made somebody smell it. That's both felony and serial killer combined at
[3831.75s -> 3837.43s]  the same time. So every felony to serial killer to see if cows get lonely when they get lost from
[3837.43s -> 3843.10s]  the herd. Isn't that ridiculous or waste of money? Of course they do. Who wouldn't?
[3843.10s -> 3846.78s]  Anyway, we want to conduct our own tests, so we need to fly all around the country.
[3846.78s -> 3851.18s]  We'll need maps, information about different cities, states and a bunch of other junk.
[3851.18s -> 3853.98s]  Now that's where you come in. Information is your middle name.
[3853.98s -> 3859.82s]  I don't know these. I don't. Nobody does. People that pretend to be or see button to
[3859.98s -> 3863.90s]  all right. I know where every major city is in the entire state of Delaware.
[3863.90s -> 3867.18s]  I don't fucking have any idea which of the above states was the first to
[3867.18s -> 3869.50s]  ratify the United States Constitution. I don't know if Delaware.
[3876.54s -> 3879.42s]  Now that was a mystery to be said. I said to get that right.
[3879.42s -> 3885.67s]  I'm proud. Jeremy, you really don't know what the third capital of Delaware is.
[3890.98s -> 3897.43s]  Didn't like it. He really didn't like it. He hated it. He doesn't like this week at all.
[3897.91s -> 3923.37s]  Just me slapping myself missing socks. For years, people had their theories.
[3923.37s -> 3926.33s]  Perhaps they were stuck to the wall of the washing machine or dryer.
[3926.33s -> 3931.13s]  Maybe you dropped one on your way to the laundromat. Or maybe there's a little man
[3931.13s -> 3934.65s]  or woman possibly related to whoever turns the light off in the refrigerator when you
[3934.65s -> 3940.41s]  close the door. And maybe that person likes to mess with our minds. They're taking socks
[3940.41s -> 3945.61s]  one at a time just to screw us up. Or maybe we're not losing socks at all.
[3946.65s -> 3952.81s]  Maybe we're gaining new socks one at a time. That's some 500 IQ shit right there.
[3954.17s -> 3968.87s]  Maybe we're just gaining them one at a time. I don't know why I just thought that headline
[3968.87s -> 3972.71s]  was going to say that they were fired for something like a scandal of kid TV.
[3974.23s -> 3978.47s]  Person that put severed toe in jar somehow turned out to be a fucking criminal.
[3978.47s -> 3988.78s]  How much water do we need? Why so much grape juice? These are bonafide mysteries, my friend.
[3988.78s -> 3993.48s]  I've said it a million times and I'll say it again. Research is everything on this show.
[3994.04s -> 4001.46s]  Let's go do some. I'm ready. Use the joy pad and the A button to select letters and
[4001.46s -> 4006.34s]  unscramble the correct answer. Press B to erase and C when done.
[4006.34s -> 4011.86s]  Unscramble a word. What is the angular distance measured in degrees east or west of the prime
[4011.86s -> 4021.38s]  meridian called the equator? The angular distance measured in degrees east of or west.
[4033.83s -> 4044.42s]  Long deep to it. Longitude. It's not longitude. It's longitude. I thought it was longitude.
[4044.50s -> 4048.82s]  All the mysteries. Now, you know, I thought it was longitude, longitude,
[4048.82s -> 4055.88s]  not longitude. I thought it was longitude. Longitude, not longitude.
[4057.48s -> 4069.06s]  Like a long L O N G D I T U D E longitude, longitude. I'm still in first place.
[4083.94s -> 4087.86s]  That's not pretending. I promise. I think I'm pretending. I thought it was longitude.
[4088.50s -> 4099.88s]  Parsley flavors. Sure. Whatever. You're a snake.
[4100.44s -> 4105.16s]  Whatever do you mean? Betsy Skinner said she saw you and Nick at the movies last night.
[4105.72s -> 4110.28s]  Your anger seems a little misdirected, Parsley. Perhaps it's yourself you should be scolding for
[4110.28s -> 4116.76s]  not keeping him on a better leash. Just watch your back, Angelica Dujour. When you least expect it,
[4116.76s -> 4121.80s]  I'm gonna- You'll do nothing. You are but a small speck of dandruff on my shoulder that I just flick-
[4121.80s -> 4125.48s]  Oh, you have dandruff? Disgusting. I'm gonna spread that around the class as a rumor now.
[4126.36s -> 4154.47s]  Oh, no, don't. I'm kidding. So there. Terrific. Somebody needs to prove the press releases that
[4154.47s -> 4158.39s]  are going out. The press release gives the critics updated information about our show.
[4159.11s -> 4161.35s]  Could you look them over and fix any words that don't belong?
[4163.11s -> 4169.19s]  No, kid. All of the words on the screen are the same part of speech.
[4169.19s -> 4172.47s]  Choose the word on the next screen that is that same part of speech.
[4172.47s -> 4176.79s]  Roll nouns, okay? All right, so I found a noun. Compute planet.
[4186.30s -> 4202.10s]  Come on, kid. Learn from the best. Is this guy still picking his nose?
[4202.82s -> 4216.23s]  Is he still the nose picker? I miss the Star Wars game. We'll see it again.
[4221.30s -> 4227.37s]  It's been an hour? Yeah, I'm still interested. I gotta get to the end.
[4239.19s -> 4241.67s]  Meet people. This is every show on Nickelodeon now.
[4255.43s -> 4260.39s]  Hey there. I was driving by and I couldn't help but notice your fabulous voice. Have you ever
[4260.39s -> 4266.55s]  thought about playing Vegas? I'm a big agent. No, no, don't lump this guy in with Vegas.
[4268.34s -> 4272.66s]  You could be the next Inklebert Humperdink. Better yet, the next Elvis.
[4273.30s -> 4276.82s]  We could leave right now. What do you say? Really shitty security system around this place,
[4276.82s -> 4291.22s]  by the way. There's a laugh track. There's a laugh track on this. This is horrible. This is
[4291.22s -> 4298.81s]  like terrifying. Hey mom, can I go with a stranger? He's not going to take me in his car. Why are they
[4298.81s -> 4314.57s]  laughing at this? This is fucking horrendous. In our show, the music is really important.
[4314.57s -> 4319.64s]  It creates a mood and an atmosphere that is essential. We need to find more music. We've
[4319.64s -> 4324.12s]  been using the same stuff for weeks. Would you mind going down to the music library and checking
[4324.12s -> 4331.21s]  it out? Thanks. All right, let's do some music. Use the joy pad and the A button to select the
[4331.21s -> 4337.83s]  three instruments playing the melody. Yeah, I can do this. That doesn't sound like any...
[4339.35s -> 4352.33s]  Hey, so this is not just me going like... That's an oboe? I don't know. I don't... That's a piano.
[4354.81s -> 4363.35s]  French horn. Almost. One time I got hit in the head with a baseball and my coach told
[4363.35s -> 4367.91s]  me to shake it off. I'm not quite sure what he meant, but I offer that advice to you.
[4367.91s -> 4373.06s]  Shake it off. You okay? When did this happen? Yesterday? Or like a couple of years ago?
[4375.06s -> 4381.08s]  They work all hours of day and night. And let me tell you, their work is paying off. These shows
[4381.08s -> 4390.30s]  aren't great. Let's look at... I'm almost there. Week nine. Come on, get me to a hundred.
[4391.58s -> 4396.23s]  Fifty. It's gonna be fifty. What happened to the dog? I don't know. Yeah, where's the dog?
[4397.03s -> 4419.85s]  Where's the dog? Where's the dog? Maybe another weird like fitness thing?
[4419.85s -> 4429.74s]  ...by Jake Smith, president of the newly founded KidTV, which you're watching right now. He's also
[4429.74s -> 4436.46s]  my boss. Hi, Jake. Hi, Silva. Tell us, what made you decide to run a television station?
[4436.46s -> 4440.62s]  Well, a bunch of us kids decided we could do anything if we put our minds to it,
[4440.62s -> 4445.58s]  so we started finding good clean ways of making money. We rode lawns, sold lemonade,
[4445.58s -> 4450.70s]  cookies... The intro again. Eventually, we raised enough money to do something
[4450.70s -> 4454.86s]  real big. And we didn't like the old TV station that used to be here,
[4455.50s -> 4462.87s]  so we took it over and made it our own. I think we did a good job, don't you? Absolutely. I'm
[4462.87s -> 4467.11s]  proud of the work we've done. Is there any message you would like to send out to kids with dreams of
[4467.11s -> 4472.07s]  grandeur? Yes. I'd like kids to remember they could do anything they want if they just put
[4472.07s -> 4478.95s]  their minds to it. Anything. If you could dream about it, you could do it. Good segment. Good
[4478.95s -> 4493.14s]  segment, son. Superlative. Oh, thank God. There's John. He's fine. Sweep's week begins. What a sweep
[4493.14s -> 4508.23s]  week. Uh-oh. Another adult got in. Uh-oh. Well, I had originally called you all here to tell you
[4508.23s -> 4513.11s]  about Sweep's week, but it seems I have some other unfortunate news to announce.
[4514.07s -> 4519.83s]  Dac Jones apparently has broken in and vandalized the station. What? Stolen property from us
[4520.55s -> 4525.27s]  and generally wreaked havoc on Kid TV. So let's kick his ass. This is going to make your jobs a
[4525.27s -> 4530.07s]  lot tougher in the next week. Everything you do will be worth triple the regular rating.
[4530.63s -> 4536.31s]  And now you will have more problems to contend with. Thanks to Dac, it will be one challenge
[4536.31s -> 4544.42s]  after another game. What? There's a guy just like hiding in the halls and shit? They can't get rid
[4544.42s -> 4548.26s]  of this person. They can't get security or anything. I can't like, I don't understand. Why?
[4549.06s -> 4554.28s]  Press the A button to stop the lights and choose your three challenges.
[4554.28s -> 4561.90s]  To use my three challenges. Oh shit. It's like whammies. Oh no. Take three, sound and rewrite.
[4561.90s -> 4567.18s]  Solve the three problems by using the joy pad and the A button to select the correct damsel.
[4567.18s -> 4574.46s]  Okay, okay, okay. That's two, four, four, thirty, five, four, fifty, six, seventy, four, six, five,
[4574.46s -> 4582.04s]  no, four, seventy, one, two, two, thirty, sixty, two, sixty, three, sixty. Thank you. Two,
[4582.04s -> 4592.47s]  twenty-five, five, two, two, twenty-five, two, four, four, twenty-five. Hey, you tried. You'll
[4592.47s -> 4599.50s]  come back. Select each word requested by using the joy pad and the A button.
[4599.50s -> 4641.14s]  Alright. Adjective. Is Sunny an adjective? Geek. What? Geek is an adjective. Goofy. Hachi? Adjective. Noun, noun, geek. Geek. He actually doesn't. No, I do know. Geek is a fucking adjective.
[4641.14s -> 4690.53s]  Are you describing? Like, if you are a geek, isn't that like you're describing somebody as like a geek? I don't know what that is. I have no fucking idea. Bird? It's a piccolo. To put it in front of a noun, moron. Hey! Hey! Hey! Geek. If somebody's a geek, you're describing them as a geek. Uh oh. Is this the awards show? Is this the guy walking around the studio?
[4692.53s -> 4704.75s]  Geeky would be the adjective. Yeah. I know. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever.
[4704.75s -> 4722.95s]  I hate these award shows personally. I'm only here on behalf of my producer. I get the best in town and the least I can do is show up and get the award. So you're pretty sure you're gonna get one? I like to think positive. But if we can't, what do you do? Awards aren't everything, are they? Of course not.
[4722.95s -> 4725.95s]  This kid just dresses himself. Like, look at those shoes.
[4733.95s -> 4735.38s]  Okay.
[4740.69s -> 4743.38s]  Why am I not there?
[4747.38s -> 4751.74s]  Oh, it's the creep! Why does it fit him?
[4757.34s -> 4764.34s]  Little dachy boy when he steals your little trophy. Smelly kids.
[4774.50s -> 4776.50s]  Hit him with the trophy!
[4777.50s -> 4778.50s]  Bite him!
[4782.50s -> 4783.50s]  Go bite him!
[4790.56s -> 4792.56s]  He got it! Nice job!
[4810.78s -> 4812.78s]  The stage light falls and crushes his head.
[4815.24s -> 4817.24s]  That's a little too far, but you know what I mean.
[4825.18s -> 4826.18s]  We won!
[4831.23s -> 4832.23s]  We did it! We won!
[4842.37s -> 4851.25s]  That was great. Cool.
[4852.62s -> 4863.81s]  What happened to the Vegas guy? He didn't show up and put on a weird overcoat? How did that guy steal that jacket? It was on the kid.
[4864.81s -> 4867.50s]  I have a lot of strange questions here.
[4868.50s -> 4873.70s]  He put the coat down next to him? How did he get it?
[4875.78s -> 4889.58s]  It's freaking me out. I pray we never see anything like this again.
[4891.52s -> 4894.52s]  I actually thoroughly enjoyed this one. I thought this was gonna be an immediate next.
[4895.52s -> 4896.76s]  I thought it was pretty good.
[4897.76s -> 4903.77s]  Okay, alright. Want to speed run one more? One more? Speed run it? Do like a fast run?
[4904.77s -> 4910.49s]  No! Okay!
[4911.49s -> 4922.21s]  There was so many no's in less than a second that my chat froze for a second. That was fucking hilarious.
[4923.21s -> 4925.21s]  Alright, let's move on. I might come back to it though.
[4926.21s -> 4930.43s]  Wait, is there an after credit sequence?
[4931.43s -> 4944.94s]  Next up is going to be, probably, like I said, there was a couple, two or three here today that was the reason why I bought this.
[4945.94s -> 4948.94s]  This is the one. Waited a little while to do it.
[4949.94s -> 4955.38s]  About to play. Exclusive to the Family Feud. Fucking just, how did I, I just spoiled it.
[4956.38s -> 4960.38s]  Exclusive to the 3DO. Family Feud FMV.
[4961.38s -> 4966.07s]  I messed that up.
[4968.14s -> 4972.14s]  There's a full FMV Family Feud 3DO game. Exclusive to the 3DO.
[4973.14s -> 4975.15s]  I cannot fucking wait.
[4979.08s -> 4982.08s]  Why don't we take this opportunity to take a small break. Let's go pee.
[4983.08s -> 4986.14s]  I'll be back in about two minutes.
[5209.39s -> 5210.63s]  Back. Ready for Family Feud.
[5210.63s -> 5217.38s]  What are you guys saying? Cringe. Cringe. Cringe. What is this?
[5218.38s -> 5225.63s]  I'm so looking forward to this.
[5226.63s -> 5228.19s]  Give me the link. Quick.
[5229.19s -> 5230.43s]  Well, we do have a minute.
[5232.44s -> 5233.44s]  Before I press play, what is it?
[5241.02s -> 5248.58s]  Look, I cannot. Look, do you understand how much convincing it would take to let me be in a classroom and just disrupt the class?
[5249.58s -> 5254.80s]  I would need to hire a bunch of people. It would have to be, I couldn't do it for real.
[5255.80s -> 5259.09s]  It would be a total disruption.
[5260.09s -> 5269.15s]  Actual stream. You clearly want to do it.
[5270.15s -> 5271.15s]  Sure. I think that would be really fun.
[5272.90s -> 5276.90s]  If I spent a month straight in a fourth or fifth grade class.
[5278.72s -> 5281.72s]  And I had to actually pay attention and take tests and shit.
[5282.72s -> 5283.72s]  And see if I could get over an 80.
[5286.62s -> 5287.62s]  I think that would be really fun.
[5290.08s -> 5292.08s]  I might ruin my entire Twitch career doing that.
[5293.08s -> 5294.08s]  Because if every stream was just me in a class.
[5295.08s -> 5297.60s]  Like a fourth grade class.
[5298.60s -> 5299.60s]  I could get detention and stuff. It would be bizarre.
[5300.60s -> 5307.86s]  It wouldn't be fun.
[5308.86s -> 5309.86s]  That's why I'm not going to do it.
[5310.86s -> 5311.86s]  Alright. Let's go. Here we go.
[5313.99s -> 5314.99s]  Family Feud coming up.
[5324.55s -> 5325.55s]  Do that hamster stream. No, I can't.
[5326.55s -> 5329.14s]  I can't do the hamster stream.
[5330.14s -> 5334.68s]  Who's the host in this is what I want to know.
[5337.58s -> 5338.58s]  I wonder if it's one of the actual TV show hosts.
[5339.58s -> 5346.33s]  Because the whole thing is FMV.
[5349.36s -> 5350.36s]  Game tech.
[5356.98s -> 5357.98s]  Family Feud. Fuck yeah. That's right.
[5363.89s -> 5364.89s]  What about the chocolate factory stream?
[5366.83s -> 5367.83s]  Just give me a minute.
[5368.83s -> 5376.19s]  Let me just say quickly.
[5377.19s -> 5379.43s]  Thank you for the $50 FS Woods.
[5380.67s -> 5381.67s]  5,000 bits. Insane.
[5381.67s -> 5383.68s]  Glad to see you back streaming.
[5384.68s -> 5385.68s]  Was super happy to hear that Valve named the scout after you.
[5386.68s -> 5388.11s]  Can't think of anyone more deserving.
[5389.11s -> 5390.11s]  That's unbelievable that that was confirmed.
[5391.11s -> 5392.11s]  I can't even fucking believe it.
[5394.44s -> 5395.44s]  Family Feud. Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[5396.44s -> 5397.44s]  It's a ton of money. It's too much money.
[5398.44s -> 5399.44s]  Mole King also gave $50.
[5401.00s -> 5402.00s]  I'm watching since my brother showed me a channel in middle school.
[5403.00s -> 5405.00s]  Now I'm an adult and can pay you back for all the years of entertainment.
[5406.00s -> 5407.00s]  You're just being here is enough man. Don't worry.
[5408.00s -> 5409.00s]  That's a lot of money to give somebody.
[5410.00s -> 5411.00s]  Thank you though.
[5413.78s -> 5415.59s]  I'm ready. Let's go.
[5416.59s -> 5418.47s]  Game options. Start game.
[5419.47s -> 5420.47s]  All right. Game options.
[5421.65s -> 5422.65s]  Music on. Yeah. Rapid play on.
[5423.65s -> 5424.65s]  Difficulty. That's fine. Customize the rules.
[5425.65s -> 5426.65s]  Customize a family.
[5428.53s -> 5430.22s]  Yes.
[5431.22s -> 5432.22s]  How do I customize the family?
[5437.62s -> 5438.62s]  Oh shit.
[5440.37s -> 5441.37s]  Name. Okay. Hold on.
[5443.12s -> 5444.12s]  These are the bumps.
[5445.12s -> 5447.12s]  Absolutely. That's Pecky Bump right there.
[5450.02s -> 5452.54s]  How do I? Oh shit.
[5453.54s -> 5454.54s]  Okay. Hold on.
[5460.84s -> 5461.84s]  All right. This is the bump.
[5462.84s -> 5463.84s]  Right. The bumps family or is it bump?
[5464.84s -> 5465.84s]  Yeah. It's just not. It's not bump.
[5466.84s -> 5467.84s]  John bump. That don't matter.
[5468.84s -> 5469.84s]  Hobbies. Chess.
[5470.84s -> 5471.84s]  That's fine. Occupation. Doctor.
[5472.84s -> 5473.84s]  Intelligence. Genius. Yeah. That's good.
[5474.84s -> 5476.46s]  Pecky Bump.
[5479.30s -> 5480.30s]  You don't have to go through everybody's.
[5481.30s -> 5482.30s]  Q. Pecky Bump.
[5483.30s -> 5487.62s]  Bump. Remake.
[5488.62s -> 5491.05s]  No, no, no, no, no. This is the bump in Netflix special.
[5492.05s -> 5493.05s]  This is real actors, man.
[5494.05s -> 5496.70s]  Age of 43. Dancing.
[5497.70s -> 5498.70s]  Nurse. Intelligence. Good.
[5498.70s -> 5499.70s]  Sure.
[5500.70s -> 5501.70s]  Max Bump.
[5502.70s -> 5503.70s]  Max.
[5505.13s -> 5506.13s]  And Eric Bump.
[5507.13s -> 5508.13s]  Eric Bump.
[5509.13s -> 5510.13s]  Might be a little.
[5511.13s -> 5512.94s]  Not Eric Bump.
[5513.94s -> 5514.94s]  Zero.
[5517.53s -> 5518.53s]  Eric Bump.
[5520.02s -> 5521.02s]  Okay. Intelligence.
[5522.02s -> 5523.02s]  Zero. All right. Max Bump is going to be pretty dumb.
[5524.02s -> 5525.26s]  Hopeless.
[5526.26s -> 5527.26s]  All right. Let's do.
[5528.63s -> 5530.77s]  Let's do hopeless.
[5531.77s -> 5532.77s]  John bump is definitely not a genius.
[5533.77s -> 5534.77s]  Max Bump I would say is pretty good.
[5535.77s -> 5536.77s]  Peggy Bump I'd say is.
[5537.77s -> 5538.94s]  Peggy Bump is a genius.
[5539.94s -> 5540.94s]  Max Bump is hopeless.
[5541.94s -> 5542.94s]  Kathy Bump is poor.
[5543.94s -> 5545.94s]  And Eric Bump is hopeless.
[5547.95s -> 5548.95s]  Should we do that? No.
[5549.95s -> 5553.62s]  Because are they going to answer questions for me?
[5554.62s -> 5555.86s]  Okay. That's fine.
[5556.86s -> 5560.41s]  That's fine. That's fine. That's fine.
[5561.41s -> 5563.80s]  All right. The bump family is done.
[5564.80s -> 5566.81s]  Customize the. No. I want regular rules.
[5567.81s -> 5568.81s]  All right. Here we go. Family.
[5569.81s -> 5570.81s]  Family versus. Family. Family versus.
[5570.81s -> 5573.58s]  System.
[5574.58s -> 5575.58s]  3DO system versus 3DO system.
[5576.58s -> 5577.82s]  We can watch.
[5580.54s -> 5581.54s]  Keep that in mind.
[5582.84s -> 5585.49s]  All right. The bump family.
[5586.49s -> 5590.80s]  That's me.
[5591.80s -> 5593.36s]  I'm so excited. Let's go. Let's go.
[5594.36s -> 5596.43s]  Let them kill each other.
[5597.43s -> 5598.43s]  We asked 100 people.
[5599.43s -> 5600.43s]  Name a food that's terrible when eaten cold.
[5601.43s -> 5602.43s]  Terrible when eaten cold.
[5604.06s -> 5605.06s]  A food that's terrible when eaten cold.
[5606.06s -> 5607.06s]  Hot dog.
[5609.00s -> 5610.00s]  No. Eggs. Eggs.
[5611.18s -> 5612.18s]  Hot dog. Egg.
[5613.42s -> 5614.42s]  Terrible when eaten cold.
[5615.42s -> 5618.30s]  Hot dogs are suck.
[5619.30s -> 5626.82s]  Hot dog. Cold hot dog.
[5629.02s -> 5635.06s]  That's disgusting.
[5636.06s -> 5639.41s]  One word.
[5641.22s -> 5642.22s]  Gravy.
[5643.22s -> 5644.22s]  Tea.
[5651.16s -> 5652.16s]  Ice tea is amazing.
[5653.16s -> 5654.16s]  Corn.
[5655.53s -> 5656.53s]  Ice tea is apparently disgusting.
[5658.22s -> 5659.22s]  Where they are. Corn.
[5661.29s -> 5662.29s]  You grow a field of corn.
[5663.29s -> 5666.45s]  Let's see what the survey said.
[5667.45s -> 5669.52s]  All right. Let's bring it back.
[5670.52s -> 5671.52s]  Bring it back. Bring it back to the family.
[5672.52s -> 5673.52s]  Hi.
[5675.02s -> 5676.02s]  Was this like the bonus round?
[5677.02s -> 5678.02s]  How come we don't bring it back to the family?
[5682.97s -> 5687.86s]  What? Hair?
[5691.02s -> 5692.02s]  Hair piece?
[5694.28s -> 5696.10s]  Eyeglasses.
[5697.10s -> 5698.10s]  All right. So what?
[5699.98s -> 5700.98s]  Bullseye round?
[5701.98s -> 5707.99s]  If you're short on money, name the bill you delay paying.
[5709.17s -> 5710.17s]  The mortgage.
[5711.17s -> 5713.11s]  Rent.
[5716.77s -> 5717.77s]  Yeah. This is the bullseye round.
[5718.77s -> 5726.54s]  This is just to get some money in the bank.
[5728.86s -> 5730.42s]  Wrong. What?
[5734.16s -> 5735.16s]  Clothes bill?
[5736.16s -> 5737.16s]  Is it the bullseye?
[5738.16s -> 5739.34s]  The clothes bill?
[5740.51s -> 5741.51s]  You have to pay?
[5742.51s -> 5743.51s]  It was like a subscription service?
[5744.51s -> 5746.33s]  Like a fucking loot box?
[5747.33s -> 5750.33s]  For $5,000, can you give me the bullseye answer to this?
[5751.33s -> 5753.08s]  Come on.
[5754.08s -> 5756.34s]  Name a year round sport.
[5757.34s -> 5758.34s]  A year round sport.
[5759.52s -> 5761.40s]  That would be darts.
[5765.71s -> 5766.71s]  Play darts at any moment at any time ever.
[5766.71s -> 5772.11s]  League of Legends.
[5774.18s -> 5776.00s]  Darts.
[5777.00s -> 5781.50s]  Oh, fuck you. It's darts. It's bowling.
[5782.50s -> 5783.50s]  Golf. You can't play golf a year round.
[5785.58s -> 5786.58s]  Fucking bowling. God damn it.
[5788.14s -> 5789.70s]  I thought it was going to be darts.
[5790.70s -> 5791.70s]  It's all right. We've got a little bit of cash.
[5792.70s -> 5793.70s]  Let's go. Bump family. Bring it back.
[5802.55s -> 5803.55s]  $7,000. Let's go.
[5804.55s -> 5805.55s]  Who the fuck plays darts?
[5809.22s -> 5810.22s]  I didn't say anybody played it.
[5811.22s -> 5813.49s]  I just said it was a thing you could do year round.
[5814.49s -> 5815.49s]  Try and give me the most popular answer to this.
[5816.79s -> 5817.79s]  Name something fathers and sons do together.
[5818.79s -> 5819.79s]  Shit.
[5821.99s -> 5824.13s]  I don't think so.
[5825.13s -> 5826.13s]  Let's see what the survey said.
[5827.13s -> 5828.13s]  No. It's going to be zero.
[5835.06s -> 5836.06s]  What? I get a chance?
[5837.06s -> 5838.06s]  Okay. Wait, he passed it?
[5839.06s -> 5840.06s]  Name something fathers and sons do together.
[5841.06s -> 5843.58s]  Catch.
[5845.59s -> 5846.59s]  It's going to be at least number two or three.
[5849.11s -> 5850.11s]  Oh, yeah. Talk, though.
[5852.95s -> 5854.77s]  Talk is a great answer, but not catch.
[5856.71s -> 5857.71s]  Great. We have to get this.
[5858.71s -> 5859.71s]  Okay. Name something that fathers and sons do together.
[5866.50s -> 5873.38s]  Fishing.
[5874.38s -> 5875.38s]  I'm going to say fish. Yes. Fine.
[5878.73s -> 5879.73s]  It's not even accurate.
[5880.97s -> 5881.97s]  Fuck. Wait, this is like 1993.
[5883.21s -> 5887.71s]  That is accurate.
[5888.71s -> 5889.71s]  Of course it is. Yeah, this is like 1991.
[5892.30s -> 5893.30s]  All right. What else?
[5894.30s -> 5896.94s]  Fish. What other father and son do together?
[5897.94s -> 5899.76s]  Yard work?
[5901.19s -> 5902.19s]  Yard work.
[5903.19s -> 5904.19s]  Mow the lawn? Lawn?
[5905.19s -> 5907.78s]  I want just lawn. Lawn care.
[5908.78s -> 5914.56s]  Like yard work. Yard.
[5922.33s -> 5923.33s]  I'm going to say yard work. That sounds good to me.
[5924.89s -> 5928.56s]  You go out of the yard, you mow the lawn.
[5929.56s -> 5930.93s]  Yard work.
[5931.93s -> 5935.98s]  Shit. I tried catch. Catch didn't work.
[5937.61s -> 5940.83s]  What other father and sons do together?
[5942.97s -> 5943.97s]  Hunting? Camping?
[5946.23s -> 5947.79s]  My dad didn't go fucking camping.
[5948.79s -> 5950.42s]  Camping. Barbecue.
[5951.42s -> 5959.62s]  Good answer.
[5962.46s -> 5963.46s]  Good answer.
[5964.46s -> 5965.46s]  Go camping.
[5971.75s -> 5972.75s]  Did you go fishing?
[5973.75s -> 5976.59s]  No, I never went fishing with my dad.
[5977.59s -> 5979.59s]  I think both of us saw that as something we didn't want to ever fucking do.
[5982.18s -> 5983.18s]  All right. What else is there?
[5984.18s -> 5985.93s]  Mow the lawn.
[5987.10s -> 5992.20s]  If hunting is on here, I mean, remember, anytime you go outside,
[5992.20s -> 5994.20s]  my dad's going to be there too, apparently.
[5999.54s -> 6000.54s]  Is there anything outside of the house?
[6001.54s -> 6002.84s]  Like if you open the door and leave, I might as well put...
[6003.84s -> 6004.84s]  This 12 answers here.
[6005.84s -> 6007.14s]  There are 12.
[6008.14s -> 6010.47s]  Should I just put go get the mail?
[6011.47s -> 6015.91s]  There are 12 answers.
[6016.91s -> 6017.91s]  I don't know. What the hell could possibly one person have said?
[6018.91s -> 6023.67s]  Golf?
[6024.67s -> 6026.67s]  At some point, if you run this show, I think you cut off like three or four of the answers and just put like...
[6027.67s -> 6028.67s]  Get ready to steal.
[6029.67s -> 6032.32s]  Oh my fucking God.
[6033.32s -> 6035.39s]  You catch? I did catch.
[6036.57s -> 6039.98s]  Drink.
[6040.98s -> 6041.98s]  Dad?
[6042.98s -> 6046.14s]  Who drank with their dad?
[6047.14s -> 6048.14s]  What he did.
[6051.05s -> 6052.05s]  Ball game.
[6053.05s -> 6054.05s]  I knew it. That's what I said.
[6055.05s -> 6056.05s]  I said catch, but then I said go to a game.
[6060.81s -> 6061.81s]  It's going to be number two.
[6062.81s -> 6068.21s]  Play ball.
[6069.21s -> 6070.21s]  Ball game.
[6071.21s -> 6073.54s]  Business.
[6074.54s -> 6079.17s]  I said golf.
[6080.17s -> 6081.17s]  You eat with your dad?
[6082.17s -> 6083.17s]  Yes, of course you do.
[6084.17s -> 6085.17s]  You live in the same fucking house.
[6087.69s -> 6088.69s]  Of course you're going to eat at the same place.
[6089.69s -> 6092.21s]  I don't like that.
[6093.21s -> 6095.21s]  I have a goldfish. Do you eat with your goldfish because they're in the same house?
[6099.65s -> 6101.78s]  We asked a hundred people.
[6102.78s -> 6103.78s]  Name any member of Britain's royal family.
[6104.78s -> 6105.78s]  I have no idea. I have no idea.

[13518.03s -> 13525.44s]  I guess that's all that's the only resemblance. All right, let's go
[13528.80s -> 13532.73s]  Oh
[13532.73s -> 13534.89s]  I don't even know why I ran that guy over that was uncalled for

[13844.35s -> 13848.22s]  This one here. How about this one?
[13848.22s -> 13853.20s]  250 cc the thing that no one ever picked in mario kart because it was way too hard
[13853.68s -> 13858.88s]  50 or 100 cc only these games the game became fucking possible after 100 cc
[13859.92s -> 13861.52s]  Uh, what was I saying?
[13861.52s -> 13871.50s]  How about the killer rat? How much is that one? I don't have enough. We're gonna do the

[13895.31s -> 13899.95s]  Handling crisp moderate acceleration substandard top speed
[13900.59s -> 13902.64s]  I think sucks
[13902.64s -> 13906.84s]  How much is a what about like a a super bike or a sports bike?
[13907.64s -> 13914.24s]  No, these are all way too expensive. It's worse than what I have sports bike
[13914.88s -> 13918.03s]  13 grand
[13918.03s -> 13920.51s]  11 grand. No, I don't have I have to buy one of the shitty ones
[13921.07s -> 13924.59s]  Yeah, I gotta buy one of the shitty rat ones
[13927.16s -> 13929.48s]  Corsair bike
[13929.48s -> 13931.48s]  All right. What about the corsair bike?
[13941.08s -> 13943.08s]  RGB bike
[13943.16s -> 13944.36s]  Oh
[13944.36s -> 13946.92s]  Let's get it
[13946.92s -> 13949.64s]  non top speed non negotiable
[13950.34s -> 13952.34s]  acceleration imperceptible
[13952.92s -> 13955.08s]  Handling. Yeah, I mean like these are huge words
[13956.10s -> 13958.10s]  Wait, this is like I already have
[13961.24s -> 13965.66s]  Oh, all right. We're gonna go with the paro
[13970.68s -> 13976.54s]  Acceleration a bad joke a bad joke. Whatever. I'm just gonna get it. You bought yourself a new bike. Keep the rubber side down
[13977.18s -> 13986.70s]  All right. Let's give it a try
[13986.78s -> 13990.84s]  What we got on the board here
[13990.84s -> 13994.04s]  Your panzer club hang out with your buds and pick up your next race
[13998.66s -> 14004.58s]  All right napa valley fix the mic delay. Has there been a mic delay?
[14005.54s -> 14015.45s]  Couldn't be
[14015.45s -> 14021.40s]  There is a delay. How bad is it? It's a very slight delay
[14024.01s -> 14029.77s]  You said there was a delay. Yeah, but I compensated for it by making my microphone of 1000 milliseconds slower
[14030.57s -> 14043.94s]  It's a new bike
[14043.94s -> 14046.34s]  I'm seeing your moves before you do them
[14046.50s -> 14048.50s]  Um
[14048.74s -> 14052.82s]  No, one of us get by that car that's fucking ridiculous. No way somebody had to get hit by that thing
[14053.78s -> 14059.29s]  What do you mean the bike sucks? Look at the handling
[14067.50s -> 14071.26s]  Funniest part about this is it really had a mature audience warning
[14073.16s -> 14089.69s]  I really think they do this in mario kart now. This game reminds me of what you hear when you get a concussion
[14110.20s -> 14121.66s]  It's true
[14128.26s -> 14130.26s]  Oh

[14166.66s -> 14168.66s]  What how did you not fall off?
[14180.90s -> 14182.90s]  Yes, I have been concussed before
[14192.54s -> 14195.10s]  I need to pass him. I don't want to be in second place
[14195.90s -> 14209.67s]  Guys did I tell you the story about me and my brother when we were playing like, uh, like hold on
[14210.39s -> 14213.91s]  Sorry, I don't know if I was trying to avoid that person or trying to hit them on purpose. I don't know
[14216.06s -> 14219.66s]  I fell off the side of my bed when I was a little kid and I was like probably
[14220.62s -> 14222.30s]  10 12
[14222.30s -> 14227.50s]  I hit my head on the back of the front of a fireplace and I had to get like six staples in the back of my head
[14233.14s -> 14237.62s]  Oh, yeah, that's oh, yeah, that's real
[14238.34s -> 14246.22s]  And here we go again
[14246.22s -> 14248.36s]  Here I am
[14248.36s -> 14260.89s]  Doing my trophy
[14260.89s -> 14263.93s]  All right. I think uh, I think we've seen all we need to see from road rash
[14271.06s -> 14272.42s]  important look
[14272.42s -> 14286.87s]  Important important important important. Hold on. Right. Yeah, now this is what we're talking about. This is a daily occurrence on this stream
[14298.32s -> 14299.78s]  $1,000 each

[14404.92s -> 14413.12s]  I guess you could didn't they didn't they did it on playstation 1 right guardian war
[14415.54s -> 14417.54s]  1994 micro cabin corp

[14970.95s -> 14977.67s]  Yeah, I could see myself being
[14977.67s -> 14981.67s]  13 14 years old and just being on newgrounds and beating this whole game five times

[15051.61s -> 15058.09s]  All right, this looks like a
[15058.09s -> 15062.01s]  An encounter wait, what are they doing back there?

[15129.84s -> 15131.04s]  danger

[15132.56s -> 15134.56s]  All right, look there's chests over here
[15134.72s -> 15136.72s]  I gotta open up at least one of these chests
[15136.96s -> 15142.14s]  I got 63. I'm okay
[15147.77s -> 15151.64s]  Behold pumpkin basic level is now two
[15153.00s -> 15156.59s]  Just clean this up. Holy light
[15157.47s -> 15164.12s]  Everybody's gonna get addicted to this
[15164.68s -> 15166.28s]  No, no, I will not
[15166.36s -> 15172.04s]  I just want to see the at least first level and maybe the next party member your new power
[15172.68s -> 15176.33s]  All right chests, let's see there
[15178.60s -> 15182.30s]  Listen, it's a different weapons
[15182.30s -> 15184.30s]  And a stone. Oh, that's cool
[15186.28s -> 15187.96s]  Probably have to grind
[15187.96s -> 15189.56s]  I'm sure you do
[15189.56s -> 15206.64s]  What's in this one? Oh, where's stone? Cool. All right, let's keep going
[15210.68s -> 15216.60s]  I got three enemies let them come to me. That's good. That's fine. I'm dead right off the bat
[15217.40s -> 15220.73s]  Uh
[15220.73s -> 15223.05s]  The disc just made a really awful noise in there
[15223.77s -> 15227.61s]  That was not a good sound. I don't know if my noise gate might not have picked that up. That was a crunch
[15228.92s -> 15232.25s]  Just went
[15232.25s -> 15236.67s]  uh
[15236.67s -> 15238.67s]  My you remember the last time remember I told you
[15241.08s -> 15244.04s]  The 3do gets really hot and maybe it's mechanically breaking
[15244.92s -> 15249.69s]  I don't know how long it's been four and a half hours. It's all right. We're okay
[15250.25s -> 15253.13s]  How hot is it? It's a little hot. It's a little warm
[15253.93s -> 15261.93s]  You're smelting the disc
[15263.16s -> 15265.16s]  It's all right. We got what's after this
[15265.98s -> 15268.54s]  Let me see
[15271.20s -> 15274.72s]  Psychic detective is gonna probably a whole stream. I need to be honest with you
[15276.16s -> 15278.16s]  You guys have a wire head
[15278.16s -> 15283.12s]  I'm getting lots of wire head vibes from psychic detective. That's probably gonna have to be an entire stream
[15290.54s -> 15292.54s]  I'm saving some of these ones
[15293.05s -> 15296.41s]  We'll go through some of the fun ones to veto and just play for like 30 minutes 40 minutes
[15297.05s -> 15299.85s]  But there are some that are going to be probably at least four or five hours
[15300.41s -> 15304.94s]  It's gonna die
[15304.94s -> 15306.46s]  Wait, what happens if he dies?
[15306.46s -> 15311.63s]  Okay
[15311.63s -> 15313.63s]  But why did he buy see a 45 health down?
[15314.67s -> 15322.96s]  I didn't lose. Well, do I need to kill for this?
[15323.52s -> 15326.84s]  They do it
[15327.32s -> 15329.32s]  No, this is the boss zone
[15329.56s -> 15335.96s]  I need to heal
[15341.39s -> 15343.71s]  It's a missing texture, I don't think it's a missing texture
[15345.92s -> 15351.47s]  Don't lose all your bad
[15351.47s -> 15352.96s]  That's okay
[15352.96s -> 15362.48s]  I'm not concerned about that
[15362.48s -> 15367.68s]  What you worms dare oppose our lord azrael, all right, then die
[15371.31s -> 15380.12s]  Music change. Why do we get a music change? Okay. I gotta heal him
[15386.78s -> 15400.75s]  Four that's it. The soundtrack's pretty good. Yeah, it is
[15406.81s -> 15411.16s]  These defense panels maybe they are
[15413.72s -> 15419.23s]  Well, that hurt all right. Well now he's off that panel. Let's see if we can get him
[15420.03s -> 15429.68s]  Yeah, yeah, that's a little better
[15430.80s -> 15432.76s]  Holy like this guy
[15432.76s -> 15444.09s]  You got a new soundtrack you can play
[15444.41s -> 15456.27s]  It's true
[15456.27s -> 15460.20s]  He's focusing the healer. That's smart. I'm not gonna do you any good though
[15462.41s -> 15464.89s]  Holy light might affect multiple targets. It's lined up
[15465.77s -> 15469.68s]  maybe
[15473.21s -> 15475.85s]  This is cool, this actually is pretty cool
[15476.97s -> 15485.61s]  What IGN give us?
[15485.61s -> 15487.69s]  52 damage. Holy shit. That was a lot
[15488.33s -> 15492.94s]  Are we surprised if IGN reviewed this game?
[15495.32s -> 15497.32s]  7.8 out of 10
[15497.32s -> 15499.76s]  That's not bad
[15500.24s -> 15502.24s]  That's not bad
[15505.71s -> 15512.30s]  Wait, oh this is the this must be the boss there's a ton of health. I gotta heal myself
[15516.14s -> 15522.92s]  Look up the meta critic scores
[15524.60s -> 15534.04s]  You just said i'm gonna veto this game
[15534.12s -> 15539.68s]  I know I know but I just want to get at least to pass the first level or two. I don't believe this
[15544.70s -> 15546.70s]  Feeded all the enemies nearby
[15546.94s -> 15556.33s]  Okay, let's go done
[15557.77s -> 15565.05s]  You win
[15565.05s -> 15580.43s]  You go very talking. Who's just talking? Okay. Well, do I have to go there? I guess we this is the next squad
[15581.55s -> 15591.07s]  Land of east canal. There are 17 enemies to feed them all. All right
[15592.35s -> 15596.59s]  This is a fun game. It's a cute game, but we got a lot of 3DO games to get through
[15599.88s -> 15603.80s]  It's cool though. I like it. Let me just try to see if I can get holy light on more than one person
[15604.28s -> 15609.64s]  You know what I mean? Like I have to figure that out first. I know just wait. I vetoed it already
[15619.93s -> 15624.17s]  It's it's vetoed trust me. I just want to see if I can wholly light on one person in the line like you know
[15624.17s -> 15625.21s]  two people
[15625.21s -> 15629.26s]  Holy light
[15629.26s -> 15631.26s]  Even get these both these people
[15634.17s -> 15637.93s]  No, they're not lined up. It's just right there. All right, that's cool. That's cool. All right. All right
[15638.65s -> 15645.74s]  It's fun game. The game's cool
[15645.74s -> 15648.62s]  That was guardian war. I highly recommend it if you
[15649.18s -> 15653.20s]  Um want to have like a bag of cheetos after school late for like a couple hours a day
[15654.00s -> 15657.08s]  That's what I would do
[15657.08s -> 15660.97s]  All right. Let me put in let's put in the probably one of the last one or two of the night
[15662.01s -> 15663.05s]  today
[15663.05s -> 15665.84s]  Do probably a couple more
[15665.84s -> 15670.01s]  I gotta pee again
[15670.01s -> 15672.01s]  I'm peeing on the hour almost every hour
[15672.57s -> 15676.81s]  Let's give me a break every exactly. It's been exactly every hour and 30 minutes, hasn't it?
[15678.73s -> 15681.50s]  It has been
[15681.50s -> 15685.90s]  First time I went pee was an hour and 30 second time was three hours and now it's four hours and 30 minutes
[15686.46s -> 15689.60s]  I'm on an exit i'm on a schedule apparently i'll be right back
[15690.24s -> 15848.19s]  Okay, this next one
[15848.35s -> 15849.96s]  is
[15849.96s -> 15852.12s]  Probably the one that i'm most interested in
[15853.72s -> 15855.72s]  Not because I think the game's gonna be any good
[15855.96s -> 15858.76s]  Because like the game's gonna be fun to play or there'll be something interesting
[15858.76s -> 15861.64s]  But just because this is one of the most expensive 3do games
[15862.52s -> 15865.85s]  The game is called captain quasar
[15867.31s -> 15872.49s]  Made by studio 3do and it was the most expensive game. I don't know why
[15879.63s -> 15880.67s]  Break it
[15880.67s -> 15883.15s]  Yeah, all the expensive ones we smash over our heads
[15884.20s -> 15886.20s]  How much was it? I don't want to say
[15886.20s -> 15889.58s]  I don't want to say because it's embarrassing
[15889.58s -> 15894.78s]  But hey remember I own it forever and it's mine forever and I have it and it'd be worth probably three grand in five years
[15896.40s -> 15900.08s]  No, it was not more. Okay. It was not more than a hundred dollars. Okay, I promise
[15900.72s -> 15920.48s]  Captain quasar that's not captain quasar. That's captain quasar. Apparently this game's worth more than 200
[15923.60s -> 15929.28s]  The universe was once a lovely place to live broad smiles beamed from every planet in the milky way
[15929.76s -> 15937.04s]  Law abiding galactic citizens thrived under the happy twinkling stars and goodwill flowed from one end of the cosmos to the other
[15937.84s -> 15940.16s]  But then things changed
[15942.88s -> 15944.88s]  Are you hearing my voice first?
[15953.84s -> 15959.28s]  Is this the sad twilight of our glorious civilization are these the last ticks of the cosmic clock? Oh dear
[15959.52s -> 15963.60s]  Where are we to turn? What are we to do? What? Oh, what is to be our face?
[15968.99s -> 15977.92s]  Relax oh my goodness here he comes captain quasar
[15994.51s -> 15997.96s]  Me
[16031.50s -> 16034.70s]  I hope there's a musical interlude before every level every awesome
[16036.22s -> 16051.21s]  Watch this be a fucking card game a disappointing, right?
[16064.64s -> 16069.37s]  That's a clap for me there that was awesome captain quasar
[16070.33s -> 16071.93s]  reviews
[16071.93s -> 16075.53s]  Always watch previous first before the movie. I hope it's the same basketball game
[16079.42s -> 16081.42s]  Battle an encounter between opposing forces
[16089.32s -> 16091.32s]  Same bet is the basketball game
[16097.29s -> 16100.49s]  Battle sport, do I have this?
[16107.24s -> 16109.24s]  Holy shit, I don't think I have battle sport
[16109.88s -> 16111.08s]  I might
[16111.08s -> 16130.73s]  Would you actually play ball?
[16133.05s -> 16135.13s]  Rocket league, but
[16135.13s -> 16136.65s]  I don't say that
[16136.65s -> 16138.17s]  Don't say that
[16138.17s -> 16140.17s]  Is this like rocket league?
[16153.21s -> 16156.41s]  It is rocket league, but there's no weapons in rocket league. There's no missiles
[16157.29s -> 16163.82s]  That looks fun
[16163.82s -> 16176.30s]  All right remind me to go over my collection of like 30 games that are still left over here and look for battle sport
[16178.89s -> 16185.34s]  It might be in there. I don't know. Okay captain quasar new game. Let's go

[17427.53s -> 17430.97s]  Two weeks of work for six months of pay not bad. Not bad at all
[17431.05s -> 17434.09s]  Well, the cook is always the last to know what the hell is going on
[17434.73s -> 17436.73s]  This is like a riddle of what food am I?
[17437.05s -> 17440.73s]  I never would have taken this if I knew it was going to be a bug hunt
[17441.29s -> 17445.45s]  I hate bug hunts the mercs got greased inside half an hour. No surprise
[17446.22s -> 17449.74s]  They were all a bunch of sorry-ass stim freaks too bad
[17449.74s -> 17452.22s]  They're the ones who knew how to move this crate
[17452.54s -> 17457.50s]  I've been awake three hours help is three months away and the bugs that we already managed to blast a few holes in this ship
[17457.66s -> 17461.10s]  I figured my chances are better outside than being a sitting duck out here. The weapons are gone
[17461.10s -> 17464.22s]  But my firing brain is gone gulps got to run things are heating up
[17464.22s -> 17472.06s]  I guess it's time to find some fresh meat love ox ai dungeon

[17500.28s -> 17504.11s]  How do I get over this?
[17504.11s -> 17506.11s]  It's there's a feet cam
[17517.05s -> 17527.28s]  All right, kill him

[17531.76s -> 17542.67s]  All right, i'm gonna go this way. Don't I did I jump too far?
[17547.64s -> 17553.72s]  Okay down something behind me
[17566.38s -> 17568.38s]  I got stuffed under something
[17568.38s -> 17590.88s]  I can't just die in the first room. Okay, I made it going up. Can I get a gun?

[17637.00s -> 17640.68s]  So what happened the lower health that I get do I get like a doom when my feet get more crusty or what?
[17642.73s -> 17645.13s]  What's no, what's the indicator up? What does that mean?
[17645.45s -> 17662.08s]  Like do I get we get dirty bare feet for the more health I lose. Let me try this again
[17662.16s -> 17682.00s]  I just put it on easy. Let's just go down. It's your feet level. Somebody's got the speed run on this. I'm sure it's insane
[17683.32s -> 17686.60s]  Switch to the feet weapon. I only have a frying pan. I don't have anything else
[17694.86s -> 17716.17s]  Get out of there and only so far we get drew crew. It's time for a feet fleet

[17729.08s -> 17752.22s]  Eat fleet feet fleet now. None of you guys actually want to see this game played you guys are painfully typing that and then
[17754.38s -> 17756.38s]  Rolling back in your seat going. Uh
[17756.94s -> 17772.96s]  And somebody just look up poed. What does the feet meter do? It has to be a reason for its existence
[17773.60s -> 17779.40s]  It doesn't just exist for no reason. I see a weapon over there. It looks like a weapon, right?
[17786.91s -> 17788.91s]  Oh shit. What is it then?
[17788.91s -> 17792.19s]  Oh, get me out of here. Get me out. Get me the fuck out. Get me out. Just get me out
[17796.09s -> 17798.09s]  I don't want this on my history
[17798.64s -> 17801.60s]  It's on no it's on my history and did I fall through?
[17802.24s -> 17810.16s]  I'm gonna go up
[17812.25s -> 17822.44s]  What the fuck just happened why did it go up I can't ride it up
[17823.24s -> 17834.56s]  Being crushed
[17834.56s -> 17836.96s]  I don't think I can take it anymore. I don't think I take it. I think I have to stop
[17837.04s -> 17847.21s]  I can't take it anymore. It's I can't do it. It's freaking me out. This is fucking me up. I can't captain
[17847.21s -> 17850.01s]  Quasar made me physically ill and now I don't know what to do
[17861.76s -> 17866.40s]  What this is your basic travel mode? You can change your foot speed between normal and turbo
[17867.36s -> 17870.76s]  Press x what?
[17870.76s -> 17874.33s]  What?
[17874.33s -> 17876.33s]  It's just to put shoes on button
[17879.63s -> 17883.07s]  That made it so much worse that made it worse, but I wanted to be a feet again. I'll throw up
[17883.23s -> 17893.50s]  Wait new weapon. How do I change that? What's throwing?
[17901.96s -> 17905.00s]  Nice. Okay. What is this fucking game? I don't know man
[17905.64s -> 17908.22s]  Something that's about to get vetoed in exactly 30 seconds
[17908.78s -> 17919.02s]  It wasn't even running shoes either
[17924.36s -> 17932.88s]  Go up. What the fuck get up there and quasar i'm gonna puke in my own lap
[17933.52s -> 17940.30s]  All right, which one goes up? Let's go over this way
[17940.62s -> 17948.73s]  Okay
[17948.73s -> 17952.12s]  Okay. Okay. Okay
[17952.12s -> 17955.24s]  Okay. No, i'm done. I have to veto this I have to veto the whole stream actually
[17955.96s -> 17958.46s]  I gotta get up. I'm gonna puke
[17958.46s -> 17960.46s]  I'm not even kidding either. That's the worst part
[17961.72s -> 17965.05s]  We made it to five hours. We're good
[17965.13s -> 17967.13s]  That was a bare feet
[17967.21s -> 17970.56s]  video game
[17970.56s -> 17972.16s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow
[17972.16s -> 17975.04s]  Tomorrow, I don't know if we're gonna do 3do
[17975.36s -> 17978.00s]  Um, I mean we might need a 3do break stream tomorrow
[17978.48s -> 17983.71s]  I'd do something else or we might just start one of the long form 3do games
[17985.98s -> 17990.94s]  So tomorrow we're not gonna blow through like six seven plus games on the 3do. If I play it again
[17990.94s -> 17995.15s]  We're gonna do like psychic detective or we'll do something else
[17996.96s -> 18001.02s]  I will see you guys tomorrow. Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking around as always
[18002.11s -> 18007.34s]  Uh, thanks for the like 800 subs. It's been an absolute insane amount
[18009.39s -> 18012.27s]  Oh ftk, right? I want to tell you ftk is happening
[18012.91s -> 18014.91s]  on october 3rd
[18015.07s -> 18021.42s]  That is the new date for ftk saturday the 3rd in the afternoon. I believe starting at 3 pm
[18022.06s -> 18031.47s]  Pacific time it is not happening next weekend or this weekend. I wasn't exactly sure the moment I was going to come back
[18032.12s -> 18036.12s]  So I just decided look let's just push it out. So I know that i'll be back, right?
[18036.28s -> 18042.46s]  So october 3rd is the new date. That's when everybody can kind of reconvene and do it all over again
[18045.32s -> 18049.69s]  And I will see you guys
[18049.69s -> 18055.29s]  But let's show the credits because it's probably going to be insane because there were like 6 000 community subs earlier
[18057.07s -> 18064.25s]  Look for battle sport. That's right. I will let's uh go over there. Here they come
[18065.76s -> 18075.02s]  In alphabetical order going at insane speed unreadable. Thanks everybody for subscribing. Thanks all the community subs
[18075.02s -> 18078.44s]  It's been a lot. I think I missed a lot of subs
[18078.76s -> 18083.05s]  It was just coming in so hot that I I couldn't even catch them
[18084.57s -> 18094.67s]  Thank you everybody to continue to give this stream insane amounts of money. I hope it's worth it. Thank you
[18094.91s -> 18102.68s]  Turbo credits, that's right. Yeah. Well, maybe well maybe we'll switch away from 3do tomorrow
[18103.32s -> 18107.00s]  There's so much I have for it. I'd rather let's spread it out a little over the next couple of weeks
[18107.00s -> 18121.88s]  What do you say seems like a good idea to me saw saw saw
[18122.44s -> 18127.60s]  Let's do a raid. Yeah, you know what somebody is streaming right now that uh, mr
[18127.60s -> 18133.04s]  Sark is streaming right now is one of my favorite internet funny people
