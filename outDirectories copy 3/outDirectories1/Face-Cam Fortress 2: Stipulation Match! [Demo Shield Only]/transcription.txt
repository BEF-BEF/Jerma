[0.31s -> 14.46s]  Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with face burnt Jerma sunburned fortress 2
[14.58s -> 17.82s]  No, this is face game fortress 2 Monday's edition
[18.30s -> 23.30s]  Playing as the demo night as you see here, but this is gonna be a very special
[24.14s -> 27.06s]  Demoman demo night video because it's going to be a live
[28.02s -> 35.39s]  Stipulation match now. What is a stipulation match? Oh, it's that it's where you're only allowed to do one
[35.39s -> 41.31s]  Very specific thing with a very weird loadout. Well, not really a weird loadout, but a weird set of guidelines and
[41.87s -> 46.85s]  This particular set of guidelines I'm using for this stipulation is shield only
[46.85s -> 52.92s]  So let's see if I can kill people with the shield in this live stipulation match
[53.44s -> 55.46s]  No
[55.46s -> 59.97s]  So I'm only allowed to kill people with the shield. That's it
[59.97s -> 65.01s]  If I try to use the sword I am eliminated even though I don't know why I would try to do that anyways
[65.25s -> 70.35s]  Unless it was on accident, but this could get very very interesting. It could be very bad, too
[70.35s -> 75.75s]  I could just totally lose this entire thing and never kill one person, but that's the beauty of stipulation
[77.94s -> 83.74s]  Splendid screen does 70% more damage. That's why I'm using it map is high tower and
[84.57s -> 88.83s]  I gotta I gotta wait till I have a little bit lower health get smashed. Oh
[90.71s -> 94.81s]  All right, there's one there's one I got one kill I'm happy with that
[95.01s -> 103.37s]  Come on who wants another who wants a shield in their face? Oh this sniper does this sniper does
[108.22s -> 111.18s]  No, no I get this guy too ready watch this
[111.74s -> 115.96s]  Come on. Give him again. Give him again. I got the assist. I got the assist
[116.52s -> 125.39s]  Where is he? Oh my god. That was scary. Come on. Come on. Oh
[125.99s -> 127.99s]  Scout oh you don't even know. Oh
[128.75s -> 135.71s]  I missed everybody. Oh my god. I'm a no man's land. Come on. Come on kill the scout kill the scout
[136.27s -> 139.20s]  Oh, no, oh
[140.04s -> 146.41s]  If he had had less health I would have killed him damn it
[146.41s -> 154.05s]  Oh, well, at least I've killed a couple people. It's not a total failure. Let's go again
[156.76s -> 162.46s]  And if you're wondering if you weren't at the live stream last night, you're wondering why I'm all burnt to a crisp
[162.76s -> 166.52s]  That's because I was at the beach the other day
[166.52s -> 170.16s]  And I wanted to I wanted to get some color in my face a little bit
[170.48s -> 176.14s]  Before I went to Seattle for Pax Prime and I stayed out a little too long in the Sun
[176.44s -> 180.40s]  So hopefully I'm not a peeling mess when it comes to Pax Prime and is anybody even
[180.96s -> 183.20s]  Nope, whatever. I'll get away
[185.74s -> 188.58s]  Hopefully I'm not appealing mess before Pax Prime is what I was going to say
[188.58s -> 195.25s]  I probably already said that but I just want to reiterate it again. This is actually pretty fun. This is not gonna lie
[195.25s -> 199.08s]  This is like fun. Some stipulations are really hard already watch this
[199.72s -> 202.30s]  Can I oh?
[202.30s -> 207.99s]  Man that would have been so epic if I'd hit somebody that ran around. It's alright. It's alright. I got my charge back
[208.67s -> 216.02s]  Who wants a shield planted in their skull? Oh this pyro does what is this guy doing?
[216.54s -> 226.09s]  Come on one more time one more time. He doesn't even know he doesn't even know he doesn't even know
[226.65s -> 232.78s]  Come on turn around. Come on one more time one more time. Let me get it. Oh

[244.62s -> 247.54s]  Is that what you think?
[248.46s -> 255.30s]  Come on why don't you stay a stabby come on? What how did that not connect? I am gonna get this spy
[255.30s -> 267.10s]  I am gonna get him don't he's gonna he's trying to stay a stabby. That's this is his plan. No. He's gone damn it
[267.10s -> 272.69s]  He's gone. No. He's right there. He's right there. Oh, I could have had him right there. I had the chance
[276.88s -> 280.85s]  Where is he dead? Did I get him? I don't think I got him
[280.85s -> 288.34s]  I don't even know if he'd done wait. Why did it make the noise? It made like the run into you noise
[288.62s -> 295.23s]  All right, come on. Let's go. Let's go got like a 19 second respawn. Holy Toledo
[295.51s -> 301.79s]  It started out pretty well. I killed like two or three people in the beginning there
[302.31s -> 307.21s]  live stipulation

[317.30s -> 321.30s]  Oh, I just clicked good thing that was not a kill because otherwise I would have been eliminated

[345.25s -> 347.87s]  He's gonna come around the corner and I'm going to smash him and he's gonna die
