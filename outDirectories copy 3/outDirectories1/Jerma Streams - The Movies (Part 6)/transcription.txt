[0.82s -> 16.62s]  Good afternoon. How are you? Hope you're having a swell day. What's up? Not much. This is unprecedented
[16.62s -> 27.64s]  amounts of early. We're fairly early, at least today, because we have to be. I've had to be
[27.64s -> 37.46s]  early over the last few streams for various reasons. How's Otto? Otto is good. I had him checked.
[38.18s -> 49.90s]  He just has some dry skin, so he has a special shampoo now that Kim and I have to use for a
[49.90s -> 60.06s]  couple weeks. Yeah, it's kind of like a dog lotion, kind of, but he'll be just fine.
[61.74s -> 66.47s]  This is the first time he's ever been in Vegas, and it's really dry and really,
[66.47s -> 72.07s]  really irritating weather out here. It's like 100 degrees. He's not really used to it, so
[73.13s -> 76.33s]  he's been very itchy. I wanted to make sure nothing was wrong with him, so
[77.30s -> 84.04s]  he's good. And the reason why we started like an hour or two early today is because I have to
[84.04s -> 89.96s]  get on a plane. I got to get out of here. I've talked about it a little bit, but going to
[89.96s -> 99.56s]  visit family and going to put like triple time into this stream that's coming up here.
[104.15s -> 111.32s]  I will be gone for just over just about a week. I'm going to be gone for like a week,
[112.04s -> 118.94s]  but this is planned. At least the family stuff, because I'm not going to be seeing a lot of my
[118.94s -> 129.45s]  family members for a very, very long time. There's a lot of movement in my family and
[129.45s -> 134.65s]  siblings and relatives. I probably won't be seeing them again for a long, long, long time.
[135.61s -> 140.73s]  So we decided we would do a little thing, and I also decided that why not take the
[140.73s -> 146.17s]  opportunity to really, really put a bunch of work into this upcoming dunk tank carnival stream.
[148.02s -> 158.95s]  So as of next week, I will have that stream in motion. So I will be away from the stream,
[158.95s -> 165.42s]  but I won't be away from the stream, if you know what I mean, in a live sense.
[166.14s -> 173.54s]  And speaking of streams, I'm going to wait until people triple in here, because the last stream
[174.78s -> 182.52s]  before Deep Rock Galactic, we had a little bit of a problem. There was a crash.
[183.32s -> 195.85s]  I lost a bunch of progress on the movies, but guess what I did? I got it! I went back and I
[195.85s -> 201.10s]  finished it, and I did it. And it's exported, and I have it right now. So we can watch it
[201.10s -> 207.38s]  before we do anything else. Also today, there are a bunch of mods installed, so I don't know
[207.38s -> 212.25s]  how stable the game is going to be. I have a shitload of new characters, a bunch of new sets.
[212.97s -> 221.67s]  We're going to try to make something in the time period that we have. So I hope to be able
[221.67s -> 226.71s]  to... I should be able to be live for about five hours. Maybe a little bit more. Maybe a
[226.71s -> 233.35s]  little less, depending on how much Kim is trying to get me to pack and get ready,
[234.07s -> 242.55s]  because she was like, hey, are you ready? Are you packed? No? Well, did you check in? No? Well,
[242.55s -> 250.60s]  what are you doing? She's not just like that, too. And Otto... Italics is going to be
[251.96s -> 257.46s]  dog-sitting for us, because he's going to be sticking around. So that's really nice of him.
[257.46s -> 266.15s]  Really good. For an ancient game, this is going to go well. I have tried a few things,
[266.79s -> 271.88s]  so it is... it does work. I've seen the characters, and I can't wait to use them.
[273.27s -> 276.95s]  This is going to be such a joke of a stream, because I'm going to just be wanting to put
[276.95s -> 282.81s]  characters in where they don't belong. I have a plan for what I want to make for the first movie,
[283.61s -> 289.64s]  and it's going to ruin everything, but it's okay. So let me just... let me be back in,
[289.64s -> 295.32s]  like, one second. I want to move something over here, and then we will watch the E3
[295.32s -> 333.24s]  presentation video. I'll be right back. Oh shit, the mic was muted. Are you guys ready?
[334.20s -> 342.70s]  Here it comes. It exported at like... they all export at 30 frames a second, or like 25 frames
[342.70s -> 349.37s]  a second, so it might... it's a little sloppy, but I got it. And there's a dog, too. All right,
[349.37s -> 398.90s]  here we go. You ready? Three, two, one, action. Wait, what? Wait, what's wrong? What's wrong?
[398.90s -> 412.41s]  What's wrong? No sound? There's no sound. Oh fuck, okay. Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
[412.41s -> 415.93s]  You can hear it, right? Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise. You can hear that,
[415.93s -> 434.17s]  right? All right, all right. And three, two, one. Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise
[434.17s -> 442.15s]  and welcome our president and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Strongs.
[452.63s -> 458.31s]  Hey, that's who I'm talking about. Welcome to E3, everybody. We're so happy to be here. We
[458.31s -> 464.63s]  are beyond excited to show you two new releases upcoming in our catalog of Oh My God Entertainment
[465.35s -> 472.55s]  games. That's Osmond, that's Michael, and that's Gary, the three of us. So excited for you to be here
[472.55s -> 478.39s]  at this E3 event. I can hear that. I can hear something over here. That's me, I'm sorry.
[483.11s -> 487.83s]  Another one of you fucking idiots has a phone up. Turn the phone up. You're gonna come to
[487.83s -> 491.59s]  E3 and try to come to my conference? Fuck you. That's two phones.
[492.55s -> 496.63s]  Come on, get up there then. 42%. What are you gonna do?
[503.40s -> 519.21s]  World premiere. Don't die on me. Die on me. Come on. Co-captain. You were my co-pilot.
[536.95s -> 541.35s]  I'm getting a reading of a strange creature. I don't know what it could be. Possibly an
[541.35s -> 662.09s]  organic compound. What is that? Thank you for joining us at this year's E3.
[662.73s -> 667.21s]  We look forward to seeing you next year, where we cancel half these games,
[667.21s -> 670.65s]  and the other half are dumbed down to a point where you're not gonna have them.
[670.65s -> 676.42s]  Oh also sorry to say, we have canceled from last year,
[676.42s -> 680.42s]  Booger Eaters 3. I decided it was not part of the planning.
[691.11s -> 697.30s]  I had to end it. I had to just end it somehow. I don't know, some of the audio was in like
[697.30s -> 704.01s]  the wrong places. In the very beginning when he's like, I, that's who I'm talking to.
[704.01s -> 711.11s]  I don't know why the first like three seconds has cut out. But look, I salvaged it. I
[711.11s -> 717.94s]  actually salvaged it. I'm happy. I was so sad two or three nights ago. I was so depressed.
[718.10s -> 724.42s]  But, why don't we just transition from there? Does someone just give a hundred bucks?
[724.42s -> 736.41s]  That phylactery lich just gave a hundred dollars. Thank you so much for the hundred bucks.
[736.41s -> 742.92s]  They say bravo. Well we have, there's more to come, because today there's,
[742.92s -> 750.50s]  I, you thought that may have been off the rails. Just wait until like, wait until R2D2
[750.50s -> 755.66s]  shows up in one of these. I, I don't know what's gonna happen. The game might break
[755.90s -> 758.30s]  over and over again, but it'll be worth it, I think, at least to play with it.
[758.94s -> 763.32s]  So, thank you so much phylactery lich. It's a lot of fucking money.
[763.32s -> 775.66s]  Why don't I open the game? Oh my god. And 20 community subs. Holy shit.
[777.72s -> 790.22s]  Uh, thank you Herbert1234 for the also huge amount of money. Thank you so much.
[790.22s -> 800.36s]  Both of you. All of you. Two huge monetary drops right now. Thank you.
[803.74s -> 816.60s]  Let's see what we can come up with. Thank you guys. So I have it saved exactly right after
[816.60s -> 826.68s]  the release of E3 presentation. Oh my god. Phylactery lich. 50 dollars from phylactery lich.
[828.10s -> 835.34s]  Uh, I will not be upstaged in this manner. Well that's another 50 dollars. Thank you.
[835.34s -> 843.85s]  And then right after that, back in gave 50 dollars. Movie sucks, Kappa. And we got acid base.
[844.57s -> 848.86s]  I don't want, I don't want you guys to see the new sets. Because some of them are fucking
[848.86s -> 853.96s]  hilarious. And they're just blasting acid base right now. I didn't do this.
[854.84s -> 860.18s]  But back to back, both of you, thank you for the 50 dollars. Dead-O 15 community subs.
[864.52s -> 868.68s]  Thank you guys. Thank you for all the fucking huge amounts of money. All the community subs.
[868.68s -> 877.98s]  This is ridiculous. Thank you. More community subs. Make it louder.
[883.74s -> 890.12s]  Oh, all right. Let's make a movie. Oh my god. What the fuck is happening right now.
[893.99s -> 901.99s]  Phylactery lich. Again, a hundred dollars. Shut up and take my money. Love you, Germany.
[901.99s -> 906.09s]  I will shut up and take your money. But first I'm going to say something.
[907.50s -> 909.34s]  That's a shitload of money. Thank you for it.
[912.41s -> 921.48s]  That's 250 bucks in 10 minutes. I'm going to be eating this steak tonight.
[923.14s -> 932.81s]  Thank you so much guys. And then camp, Karen. Camp F Karen. Five community subs.
[933.45s -> 944.79s]  We've got a little train going here. Thank you guys. Just wait. Just wait till you see
[944.79s -> 953.27s]  what happens here. The first thing we're going to do. So let's get a new script going.
[956.73s -> 961.21s]  Where's my script writing office? This isn't pretty loud though. Why is this so loud?
[961.21s -> 973.48s]  I'm like drowning myself out. There we go. That's a little better. That's a little better.
[973.48s -> 987.78s]  Okay. Now I can hear myself talking. All right. Script supervisor office. We're going to make
[987.78s -> 991.14s]  a new script and we're going to see just how much this works. We're going to do,
[991.14s -> 995.93s]  we're going to do a Batman movie. Uh, Batman and Robin versus Mr. Freeze.
[997.64s -> 1010.89s]  And maybe some other cameo. There it is. Come on. I don't even know what the hell it is.
[1012.38s -> 1019.80s]  There it is. Okay. Advanced movie maker. We're going to call this one, um,
[1020.52s -> 1024.84s]  Batman. Should I call it Batman or is that illegal? How about like, what if it's,
[1024.84s -> 1037.11s]  what if it's like a fan Batman? That makes it fine, right? Fan Batman and fan Robin.
[1038.39s -> 1050.22s]  They're just fans. How about in just, in how about that the movie just called
[1050.22s -> 1066.46s]  they're just fans. Rat man and Robin. No, but they're not rats. Okay. I'll show you.
[1067.26s -> 1071.58s]  So first of all, let's take a look at some of the new, uh, mods that we have here.
[1074.55s -> 1080.47s]  We have Robin, we have Superman, Batman, and then I'm going to say this is the Burger King,
[1081.80s -> 1084.44s]  but that's like for, you know, should we do the Burger King one first? We do like the
[1084.44s -> 1099.03s]  Burger King King. We got R2D2. We have like Warcraft characters. There it is. There's like the
[1099.03s -> 1115.14s]  Iceman. Here's Darth Vader. I think I want to do the Burger King movie first. Yeah, that's
[1115.14s -> 1122.28s]  Batman and fan Batman and fan Robin versus fan Mr. Freeze. Make him gold.
[1131.85s -> 1137.53s]  Light bulb Vader. Yeah, I got Chewbacca. I don't even know what this is supposed to be.
[1140.09s -> 1148.23s]  There's no dick, right? All right. Good. Should I make the king? I think I'm going to do the king.
[1150.65s -> 1157.00s]  Let's do a Burger King. Yeah, I think we're going to do a burger. We're going to do where
[1157.00s -> 1165.46s]  I got. I've got plenty of time. Don't worry. No, not burger alien. Okay. We need, uh,
[1171.13s -> 1175.53s]  this is the, this is the sneak king, right? Whatever his name is. What does his hair look
[1175.53s -> 1185.40s]  like? It's like, isn't it like blonde or brown? It's like this, right? That does not look
[1185.40s -> 1198.50s]  like the king. All right. Facial hair. That's just like closest it's going to get.
[1200.07s -> 1207.90s]  His hair is much different than this though. Holy shit. There it is. Okay. I got it. It's done.
[1208.63s -> 1217.48s]  There he is. There's the Burger King. Oh, it was just, all right. All right. All right.
[1217.48s -> 1223.77s]  We're good. Same, uh, hair color, right? Yeah, it's that. What color are the Burger King's
[1223.77s -> 1243.46s]  eyes? They're like green fan Burger King. Yeah. They're not red. No, this is fucked up.
[1246.84s -> 1253.70s]  Demonic Burger King. No, it can't be like that. There we go. That's better.
[1262.41s -> 1268.23s]  Okay. All right. So let's get you in that costume. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1268.95s -> 1283.62s]  All right. You're good. What happened to your hair? Why did his, why did his hair just turn
[1283.62s -> 1294.57s]  into a plastic bag from the grocery store? What the fuck just happened? Oh, his age went
[1294.57s -> 1304.55s]  all the way up. Okay. Okay. That's better. All right. We got that. We got our Burger King.
[1316.90s -> 1328.34s]  I'm protected. All right. We need, who else needs to be? This would be like a promotion,
[1328.34s -> 1336.47s]  right? This is going to be a promotional video. No, I gotta, hold on. I gotta,
[1336.47s -> 1352.65s]  I gotta protect myself here. Okay. I think that's, I think I'm more protected here.
[1354.62s -> 1358.70s]  Um, so what do I want you to see? Maybe just a couple of customers.
[1367.46s -> 1371.38s]  They always do like a DC. No, the Batman and Robin is later.
[1377.06s -> 1386.97s]  I don't have any other like McDonald's characters. Should this be a fan of Star
[1386.97s -> 1408.90s]  Wars promotion at a fan of the Burger King? No, I want, hold on. Why, why is this empty?
[1409.78s -> 1418.71s]  Why is it just an empty space? Why does this one not work? I think this one might be broken.
[1426.62s -> 1430.70s]  Oh yeah. We could do a clown. Yeah. Okay. We could do, but yeah, we're going to save our
[1430.70s -> 1443.34s]  modern. We'll do a clown. Did I have any, I think I put some more. Okay. No, it's an angel.
[1450.62s -> 1458.39s]  Patient. What if they just said like, no, no, I can't do that. I'm a fan of Burger King.
[1459.51s -> 1466.36s]  Perfect. What's Burger King's colors? Red and, uh, red and yellow, right? Wait, what?
[1467.00s -> 1476.95s]  Burger King's colors are red and yellow? Just like McDonald's. Holy shit. That just
[1476.95s -> 1485.13s]  hit me like a ton of bricks right here. It's red and yellow. Wait, it's red, yellow and blue. Okay.
[1486.01s -> 1515.58s]  That saves it. No yellow. The uniform is brown. This is just standard, standard waiter.
[1516.52s -> 1527.62s]  It's all right. There, you said brown, right? Sorry. We'll just like,
[1527.62s -> 1540.52s]  we'll YouTube their hair to be like Burger King. Okay. Hold on. What about
[1540.52s -> 1563.94s]  just like cover him in tattoos. Evil Burger King. This is not an evil Burger King.
[1563.94s -> 1577.78s]  All right. That looks all right. This person's married. All right. Then let's also do,
[1577.78s -> 1584.97s]  uh, and because everybody knows that at Burger King, there are fucking ants everywhere.
[1586.01s -> 1597.06s]  So, holy shit. It's a Burger King ant. It's a burger. Is it a Burger King ant? I can't,
[1597.06s -> 1600.90s]  no. If you're, by the way, if you're a fan of Burger King, you know that like when we make
[1600.90s -> 1611.75s]  fans of Burger King, our fan restaurant has ants in it. There's a Burger King ant right here.
[1611.75s -> 1625.22s]  Yellow and green, right? There it is. Which one, this one or this one? No, it's this one.
[1625.78s -> 1653.19s]  That's Burger King colors, right? It kind of close enough. This, this one, I like this one
[1653.19s -> 1660.84s]  too. It's like so ugly though. I don't think I can look at this. Make it a French fry ant
[1663.78s -> 1681.14s]  like that. You like a French fry ant. Okay. And this is slick. Driscoll is already like
[1681.14s -> 1691.62s]  an interesting name, but I'm going to change it to the cashier and then French fry ant.
[1698.97s -> 1711.82s]  Okay. This is a, this is a comedy, obviously. All right. So we have our, our base here. So
[1712.62s -> 1718.22s]  we are going to go to a new place. This place is called, I know I have like a restaurant
[1718.22s -> 1727.80s]  somewhere. These are the new ones. Heaven, a hospital bedroom, hell, metropolitan subway,
[1728.68s -> 1733.32s]  city destroyed by volcano, which I mean, that would be, I mean, that's kind of makes sense.
[1735.83s -> 1742.54s]  City destroyed. Oh, should I save that for Batman? Oh, here we go. Hit Pizzeria.
[1742.54s -> 1749.37s]  Pray that this works. So this is where the, we're at the, the burger, the fan restaurant.
[1749.37s -> 1762.46s]  Give money. Yeah. The King burger has to pay everybody. How much money is he given?
[1764.54s -> 1768.04s]  He's like an abusive boss.
[1780.14s -> 1785.26s]  I think I like that, but wait, hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is fine,
[1785.26s -> 1792.92s]  but we're not going to, it's not going to stay there. Undercover boss, burger king edition.
[1793.56s -> 1804.52s]  Wouldn't you just know who it is? Order. All right. Hold on. I got to think about this
[1809.53s -> 1813.29s]  under cover boss with the kid, with the, with the burger king. He's already here.
[1817.69s -> 1821.37s]  All right. Let's start with like a card writing. Maybe he's like doing the menu.
[1821.37s -> 1842.33s]  Let me see what this looks like. It's a birthday. Is he eating the pen? Why is he
[1842.33s -> 1857.21s]  putting the pen in his mouth? Sneaky. He's like the sneak king, right? That's not very
[1857.21s -> 1873.34s]  sneaky. Okay. I like that. I like that little look over his shoulder. That's sneaky. I like it.
[1873.98s -> 1880.98s]  It's staying. Okay. So sneak king, the sneaky for a minute. He's paying his employees.
[1881.70s -> 1889.35s]  He has to pay the aunt too. So that's important. Just like the start of a regular day,
[1889.35s -> 1894.36s]  pay phone, give money. Here we go.
[1894.36s -> 1912.25s]  Well, this does the same thing. It's like angry. You better step in food
[1912.97s -> 1919.58s]  and breathe in the walls. You better gross out at least two customers today.
[1924.22s -> 1934.63s]  Okay. So we can, we can cut these up. Let's open up with him
[1935.51s -> 1940.74s]  writing the letter, paying the employees, pizzeria. Okay.
[1955.27s -> 1964.54s]  All right. I look, I know that everyone's, everyone knows that this is going.
[1965.10s -> 1973.19s]  We don't even have to talk about it, but like we need to get there first.
[1974.28s -> 1980.98s]  We need to get there first. So somebody has to come in to the store, enter,
[1981.96s -> 1993.85s]  uh, to, to enter. These can just be extras. Uh, they could just be,
[1993.85s -> 2007.74s]  it could be that Sandler don't matter. How's their costumes? Pizza.
[2009.67s -> 2022.09s]  All right. Let's check. Uh, let's get some costumes here. It's fine.
[2022.89s -> 2042.30s]  And you need a costume too. Uh, this is all right. No, this is fine. All right.
[2042.30s -> 2048.70s]  They're like nursery rhyme twins somehow. Uh, that's how big we need them. They both enter
[2049.80s -> 2060.50s]  their matching clothes. And then we need a order at the window. There should be a drive-through as
[2060.50s -> 2080.62s]  well. Order a drink. Here we go. King doesn't need to be here, but, uh, you do. Let's see.
[2089.03s -> 2090.63s]  This is just a bartender.
[2093.38s -> 2118.33s]  Why is Burger King a refuse? Burger King is a bar. Oh, this is so stupid.
[2119.29s -> 2156.26s]  Serve and press. You should do like tricks and stuff. You're going to do a trick. I like it.
[2156.26s -> 2166.30s]  Okay. I also need, is it like food? Eat food. Order food. There we go.
[2170.89s -> 2172.25s]  Oh, who's coughing.
[2181.85s -> 2193.40s]  Okay. So let's, the, the aunt. Okay. I'm going to compose myself here for a second.
[2194.04s -> 2207.02s]  So he's going to order because he's already up there. Yeah. I'll go back and add extras
[2207.02s -> 2213.14s]  in a second. The aunt can take the order. That's fine. There's gonna be something wrong
[2213.14s -> 2220.55s]  with the food as things as the catalyst here. Uh, it doesn't matter. It is an extra.
[2226.12s -> 2227.64s]  Who did it? Who's the, what did I just do?
[2234.81s -> 2236.89s]  Oh, there's also, hold on. Let me, let me see if I can do this.
[2238.62s -> 2246.41s]  Props. How do I add props? Cause this is a shitload of props.
[2247.05s -> 2260.86s]  No, this is like the employer. Here we go. Okay. We need you. There you go. Sure. I get you. That's
[2260.86s -> 2284.44s]  fine. Um, this is an evening gown. You go to Burger King in an evening gown. Classy night
[2284.44s -> 2312.76s]  tonight. What are you going to order? They have the same voice. People coughing in the
[2312.76s -> 2322.66s]  background. It's disgusting. This guy is naked.
[2332.60s -> 2342.86s]  Hold on. Typical Burger King. I'm going to put a bunch of coughing and sneezing in the background.
[2342.94s -> 2384.65s]  Okay. That's fine. No, it's fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. All right. We're good.
[2389.48s -> 2407.11s]  Okay. Next we're going to do pizzeria and there's going to be an issue with the food.
[2407.11s -> 2416.70s]  I need a serve or serve food, food, eat food. Okay. Here we go. Let's see what happens here.
[2417.34s -> 2427.54s]  Please tell me there's like a choke. The king is eating in his own restaurant and he fucking
[2427.54s -> 2454.58s]  chokes and dies. And then everybody panics. What? Wait, what? How did he choke? It's disgusting.
[2457.51s -> 2459.83s]  It's the assassination plot.
[2467.93s -> 2471.51s]  And then have him fall down. What is disgust?
[2481.14s -> 2492.76s]  Fork and knife at Burger King. Are we still eating it? That's much better. Okay. I like this.
[2495.24s -> 2497.80s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not the king. It's random people.
[2506.41s -> 2511.64s]  We should cut between like two or three people eating and like being disgusted.
[2512.52s -> 2534.02s]  I'm going to change the camera angles. Is there a choke? No, there's fire choke.
[2536.89s -> 2551.46s]  Uh, food, eat food. Jesus. Okay. Let's get in there and do some camera work.
[2552.18s -> 2578.20s]  Let's go here. I need to go alt and then down. All right. This is good right here.
[2578.84s -> 2607.37s]  And then I want here. Let's see. Camera one, camera two. Let's see how that plays out.
[2623.29s -> 2639.53s]  Okay. Pretty good. Pretty good. Let's do another extra. We have,
[2639.93s -> 2649.86s]  did I do this person already? This is somebody else. Let's get in there.
[2649.86s -> 2662.10s]  Let's get in real close on this one. Or maybe, no, maybe not. If you like, like right here.
[2669.69s -> 2687.48s]  Okay. Why is people eating here? If it sucks this much?
[2687.48s -> 2702.31s]  Is this the same person eating with the, oh, she's eating too.
[2726.17s -> 2730.41s]  Okay. Now we have to have a problem in the back where it's like,
[2730.41s -> 2737.59s]  what the fuck is going on back here? This is going to be like an intense talk.
[2738.23s -> 2751.26s]  Three-way conversation in the back. No, baby. Bartender cleaning. Let's add this.
[2754.74s -> 2759.82s]  Holy shit. Even more money came in. I wasn't even paying attention.
[2759.82s -> 2769.59s]  Filactory Lich gave another hundred dollars. This is gross. Keep doing it.
[2769.59s -> 2773.43s]  And my bank called me and asked if everything was all right. I told them I was giving money
[2773.43s -> 2791.26s]  to a man I watch play video games. They remain concerned. Thank you for the hundred
[2791.26s -> 2802.04s]  bucks. Hopefully everything's all right. That's a lot of money.
[2812.52s -> 2821.24s]  All right. Let's go. Wait, why is he cleaning? Why is he tending here?
[2823.37s -> 2835.14s]  Somebody said this might be slander. It's not. This is not Burger King.
[2835.14s -> 2838.58s]  This is not. I'm going to make that really clear. This is not Burger King.
[2838.58s -> 2864.18s]  I'm going to change the name of this. No, it's not. It's not. This is not that.
[2864.18s -> 2868.42s]  I made that really clear. I'm a huge fan and this is my shitty restaurant.
[2878.71s -> 2887.32s]  All right. Don't worry. I'll fix it. Ready? Watch this. I'll fix it.
[2887.32s -> 2902.78s]  Everything's going to be fixed. No, I don't like that.
[2932.15s -> 2936.68s]  This is the real Burger King. He's like not even here. He's somewhere else.
[2936.68s -> 2953.99s]  I told you. This is a fake Burger King. You got me all paranoid.
[2954.79s -> 2973.27s]  Are we going to have to change it? You're going to fucking jail.
[2979.35s -> 2981.99s]  All right. Well, this is fine. This is the real Burger King
[2981.99s -> 3014.60s]  and he's not involved. Back to the pizzeria. All right. We have to have exit horror.
[3014.60s -> 3037.05s]  Wait, why is it like that? How horrifying. All right. Walk and talk. Let's see.
[3037.05s -> 3047.00s]  Heated argument. They sneak out without paying.
[3063.62s -> 3073.77s]  Okay. Angry. Angry, angry, angry. Let's try this.
[3083.61s -> 3089.80s]  That's not very heated. I would not classify this as heated.
[3103.61s -> 3113.58s]  Fight. Is there like a not extreme? Oh, it's ready fist fight.
[3131.16s -> 3147.38s]  A constant conflict. Burger conflict. There's always conflict. Is there argue?
[3147.38s -> 3160.89s]  How about conversation? Burger talk? Oh, what the fuck is that?
[3172.74s -> 3178.33s]  Oh, it's just the same scene from before except now he's doing it on the other side.
[3185.61s -> 3199.69s]  Holy shit. Phylactery lich is up to 400 bucks. These are the last bits. I want the next badge.
[3199.69s -> 3203.85s]  Don't worry about my money, Jeremiah. I'm set. I just wanted to share some with you
[3203.85s -> 3206.97s]  since you've been watching. I've been watching you for so long. Much love. Well, thank you
[3206.97s -> 3212.90s]  so much. That's an astronomical amount of money to give anybody. So thanks for the
[3212.98s -> 3231.75s]  400 fucking dollars. Hopefully your bank doesn't call you anymore. This is fine.
[3231.75s -> 3246.06s]  We need those extras to get out because everyone's leaving. Is this the only option
[3246.06s -> 3267.00s]  I have? Yeah, it is. Making a deal. Crystal ball. Is this like in the future? Is he looking
[3267.00s -> 3285.37s]  into a crystal ball? Have somebody choke and then go to sleep. That's not a bad scene to
[3285.37s -> 3320.02s]  put over here. Maybe somebody in the bathroom. Is there like a comedy chase in the bathroom?
[3320.02s -> 3353.21s]  No. Dilemma. Okay, that's what I want. Hold on. No, it doesn't exist. I'm gonna go down here.
[3353.21s -> 3356.78s]  Ghost Kung Fu.
[3385.24s -> 3386.82s]  Okay, well.
[3426.15s -> 3459.66s]  Hold on. Feature. What? Someone smokes a cigarette and dies.
[3491.67s -> 3512.42s]  This doesn't make any sense though. This like can't be here. All right, so then he's gonna
[3512.42s -> 3533.26s]  knock. All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Comedy chase. Tired. That looks so dumb.
[3541.88s -> 3581.80s]  I like this one. Okay. We need more people to come into the restaurant.
[3586.34s -> 3608.14s]  Okay, this one. Let's go back to, we need like a couple of a little finale here.
[3614.46s -> 3631.56s]  Enter flowers. Enter scanner. Somebody walks in with like a health inspector's scanner.
[3631.56s -> 3665.11s]  All right, I need another actor. Who's not in this? Yeah, and he finds the ant.
[3665.11s -> 3673.64s]  No, Adam Sandler was in it in the beginning. What looks the most like a,
[3688.60s -> 3698.18s]  no, no, no. This sound is probably the best. All right, he's gotta change out of these clothes.
[3704.58s -> 3720.79s]  No, that makes no sense. Here we go. R-T. No, it shouldn't be R. All right, he comes in.
[3726.97s -> 3737.14s]  No, we're gonna clean all this up in editing. Don't worry. And is it gonna be a confrontation
[3737.14s -> 3751.45s]  between him and the ant? He's gonna go in with the back. Maybe order food? Maybe he orders
[3751.45s -> 3758.92s]  food and he's like, what the fuck is this? Should he slip on a banana peel and be like
[3758.92s -> 3795.90s]  that? What's going on here? Reaction, calm, laughing, angry, angry. Watch your reaction.
[3796.79s -> 3826.07s]  Laugh. Or contempt. And then there it is. You don't just, you don't have to be in here.
[3833.59s -> 3889.45s]  The health inspector's pissed. Okay, now we need, I gotta get these like characters out of this.
[3889.45s -> 3916.87s]  I gotta, you have to be over here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What am I
[3916.87s -> 3943.38s]  thinking? What am I thinking? Am I insane? What am I talking about here? Where is it?
[3955.37s -> 3988.54s]  No, no, wrong guy. That is so loud. Camera one's better. Okay. Is it like a three person
[3988.54s -> 4050.26s]  fight? Two people attack. Here we go. What is horrific. Oh my God.
[4079.10s -> 4090.87s]  Okay. Well, these are the wrong characters. This has to be,
[4091.83s -> 4099.56s]  no, this is not an extra. No, no, no, no, no, no. Here. No, not Howard.
[4123.29s -> 4126.65s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right. No, we're done. We're done. We're done. I'm
[4127.13s -> 4145.37s]  not gonna put this together. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, hold on. Let me, hold on a second. Okay.
[4145.37s -> 4175.78s]  Hold on. Hold on. I need to change something here. Okay. I, I'm sorry. That's like no fucking
[4175.78s -> 4223.94s]  way. It's not a fucking chance in hell. You understand? You understand? Like I didn't want
[4223.94s -> 4227.54s]  this to be connected to any brand and that's what I'm doing. I want to make sure that
[4227.54s -> 4232.79s]  that's not what this is because that's not what my intention was. And now I'm like seeing
[4232.79s -> 4252.17s]  like through the fucking rear view mirror here. Burger Palace is a real company. God
[4252.17s -> 4276.68s]  gimme it. There's no fucking way that there's a burger pyramid. Okay. Absolutely zero chance.
[4276.68s -> 4303.00s]  There's no burger pyramid. There's a burger pyramid. Is that okay? Is that right? Am I,
[4303.00s -> 4350.71s]  am I in trouble now? Okay. All right. See? It's not, it's not even close to the same person.
[4350.71s -> 4390.79s]  All right. That's it. Okay. Back to normal. You're gonna get claimed for using the term
[4390.95s -> 4410.38s]  French fry. Yellow end. Old man with crown. All right. I'll, that one's fine. I'll change that
[4410.38s -> 4419.21s]  one back. But I'm not, guys, I ain't fucking around right now. Where the hell were we?
[4419.21s -> 4452.44s]  Back here? Someone's on the phone. This is perfect. Okay. I'm okay with this now.
[4453.37s -> 4459.13s]  This is no longer, this is now, this is a pretend fucking little place. This was never
[4459.13s -> 4463.13s]  intended to be anything else ever. And I said that in the very beginning. Okay. Just
[4463.13s -> 4481.70s]  make sure everyone's clear. All right. Now the fuck he would never do this. That's right.
[4481.70s -> 4512.50s]  Cause that's not the same person. All right. Now we gotta throw away. Give CPR to immediately.
[4512.50s -> 4562.44s]  Dilemma. Tame. Moderate. Frenzied. Okay. Let's be easy here. Okay. Okay. We killed them.
[4562.44s -> 4598.18s]  We killed them. The police come in. Police come in and arrest them. And that's the end.
[4598.18s -> 4651.46s]  Case closed. More ants. Okay. Why are they so happy? Okay. We gotta change this prop too.
[4651.46s -> 4670.10s]  That's like an old, kind of old rifle. Okay. And then you, I need, this is gonna be,
[4670.10s -> 4692.81s]  now you're under arrest. Take photo. Investigation. Here we go. Double sneak.
[4693.45s -> 4706.06s]  Oh, who the fuck were they again? I have to do their costumes again.
[4708.79s -> 4771.06s]  No, no, no. What, what are you doing? Okay. Good. Okay. Find rocking chair guard. Wait,
[4782.20s -> 4800.39s]  why is he in a rocking chair? Disturbance. Feeble. High. Mood. Confused. Did he get like,
[4800.39s -> 4836.42s]  did he get like a shot? What? No, that makes no sense. All right. Well, how about happy?
[4836.42s -> 4864.52s]  Same thing. Disturbance. Normal. Surprise. Angry. Angry. Okay. Here we go. No,
[4864.52s -> 4927.50s]  that's don't work. Chat up. Throw away. Should he just drink poison? All right. And then
[4927.50s -> 4962.31s]  where is it? And that's it. It's just this one. No, he's not alive. I have to change it.
[4962.31s -> 4996.89s]  No, not this one. Dog attack. Jump escape. No. Flank comedy. Wait, where is the alleyway again?
[4996.89s -> 5047.98s]  Let me see. They're gonna throw him out. Quick. Here we go. Complete. That's gonna be so long.
[5047.98s -> 5101.43s]  That's it. That's not it. Didn't he just drink poison? It's the ant.
[5113.59s -> 5132.58s]  We need an extra here like a police work. There we go.
[5165.21s -> 5171.21s]  I love the looking back. Can I make it? I'm not sure. Let's see if I can do it. I'm gonna try.
[5183.50s -> 5190.57s]  That's just, you're trying so hard to land on your back. You are jumping. You are trying
[5190.57s -> 5197.94s]  to hurt yourself. This is, please God try to hurt me as much as possible.
[5198.34s -> 5206.58s]  You're dead. You die from that, right? Do you die from that? I think you do. You might make,
[5206.58s -> 5217.78s]  will you? I don't know. It would be, you'd change your whole life. Like you would change everything.
[5229.58s -> 5234.62s]  Okay. Good. Great. He doesn't even notice.
[5234.62s -> 5243.83s]  Cut to the hospital. Just cut immediately to the hospital.
[5249.21s -> 5250.17s]  Where's the hospital?
[5268.20s -> 5269.16s]  What is going on?
[5275.32s -> 5279.24s]  No, no, no. I'm thinking they could arrest him in the bed. How is this a hospital?
[5282.66s -> 5317.75s]  Hospital bedroom. Slow start. No. Wake up. Wake up. Confused.
[5326.86s -> 5331.18s]  It doesn't really look like a hospital. Just cut to a funeral of the ant.
[5333.96s -> 5337.32s]  That makes more sense. This is not, if this is a hospital it would be better.
[5337.32s -> 5364.76s]  Or hell. Should it be heaven or hell? How is this heaven? Heaven.
[5379.16s -> 5381.88s]  Don't ask me. Okay. I think it's just supposed to be bright.
[5382.68s -> 5412.52s]  Yeah. He's just going to walk around aimlessly and then you disappear
[5413.56s -> 5424.57s]  because you're not going to be in this. Yeah. He's just like, wait, what?
[5425.53s -> 5444.34s]  What? How did I get here? No, the old man in the crown also died is what you meant to say.
[5445.78s -> 5451.06s]  Do the dumpster scene again with the old man in the crown. But he ends up in hell.
[5451.06s -> 5463.64s]  No, but he already died. No, no, no, no. I can't do this. I can't do it twice.
[5463.64s -> 5467.40s]  I do that every time. Somebody told me, they came in and they said you do the,
[5467.40s -> 5470.68s]  you do it every time. You make the thing happen twice.
[5476.06s -> 5480.94s]  All right. If I can have him do it in hell, I will. Okay. If I can jump into dumpster in hell
[5481.74s -> 5497.83s]  and then he wakes up somewhere else, I will. Okay. Hell. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5497.83s -> 5518.25s]  We got to go. We got to go back inside of the pizza place. Okay.
[5518.25s -> 5526.39s]  Okay.
[5540.04s -> 5608.04s]  He's lifting his arm. No, no, no, no, no. Carry him to the dumpster. No, no, no.
[5609.42s -> 5631.13s]  He's just going to wake up in hell now. No, no. What are you doing? I want you. Got you.
[5631.13s -> 5672.81s]  Throw into dumpster. The ant is my favorite one. Like ever. Where is it?
[5672.81s -> 5710.78s]  Alleyway. Alleyway. Am I stupid? Oh, it's got to be, I got to have a close-up of her throwing
[5711.42s -> 5768.47s]  and then it cut to this. Oh my. So it's going to go from here. Like from here.
[5770.09s -> 5784.42s]  No, no, no, no. What's going on? Whatever. I didn't, I didn't mark it. Oops. I didn't think
[5784.42s -> 5831.82s]  I had to. That's so fucking horrible. So now a scene before this, I need to have like a
[5831.82s -> 5841.13s]  close-up of putting the body down or throwing or throwing something. So let's just go,
[5841.13s -> 5850.74s]  I wonder if there's a good, yeah, throw will look all right if I get close enough.
[5850.74s -> 5858.31s]  Throw away or thrown out will be okay because there's a very clear shove. There we go. Yeah,
[5858.31s -> 5877.11s]  this is perfect. Now who was it? Was it you? Was it somebody? I think it's you.
[5877.67s -> 5902.06s]  Let's get rid of you as an actor. You're not going to be in this frame.
[5902.70s -> 5936.87s]  We also need to respect the line here. We should get rid of the door.
[5946.06s -> 5962.17s]  You know what? It actually works if that was the Kim. Oh, this is perfect. Yeah, this works.
[5962.17s -> 5965.93s]  I was afraid that I, because I didn't know if it looked like it was going to be falling or not.
[5965.93s -> 5987.67s]  This is going to be horrible. I hope you guys understand. Why did the hair change?
[5995.67s -> 6014.30s]  It's a wrong actor. I thought it wasn't Lola. Who was it? Marine? I mean, no. Who was it
[6014.30s -> 6022.76s]  before? Let's see. We can see who it is. No, it is this. It's this girl. I think their
[6022.76s -> 6033.58s]  clothes change and their hair change every time. No, this is, it's fine. All right. Mark it.
[6039.30s -> 6064.76s]  And then she falls in too because she walked off. Then we got to be in hell.
[6081.02s -> 6091.03s]  Heaven. Hell. Oh, I get it. It's just, all right. Should scream spin and then pull the whole
[6091.03s -> 6117.59s]  thing up and he's in hell. Hold on. I do have like a demon. Group chase all the demons.
[6117.59s -> 6177.00s]  Yeah, absolutely. I need the, where are they? Just need some monsters. An angel in hell.
[6195.85s -> 6207.05s]  That's so stupid. Yeah. I'm going to put like a devil on the, on the horse.
[6218.95s -> 6232.76s]  Scream spin or riot. Scream spin. Scream spin. Scream spin. Are you sure about that? Are you,
[6232.76s -> 6241.00s]  you're sure you, you, I a hundred percent. You sure about this? Like, are you sure?
[6241.00s -> 6288.57s]  After seeing that. Just keep the cheerleader. Do, do all red ants. I can put red ants like
[6288.57s -> 6326.81s]  around the corners. Wait, hold on. Here. There'll be a red ant on the horse. No,
[6326.81s -> 6350.76s]  nevermind. Sorry. I can't do that. I have to change this. Here we go. I will add a scream
[6350.76s -> 6368.94s]  spin before this and this would be, this will play us out. I got this. I got this. I got this.
[6368.94s -> 6405.58s]  Scream spin. By the way, backwards shot eyes and then the run. Now he's going to put
[6405.58s -> 6430.38s]  this piece of shit together. All right. I'm going to change something here though.
[6430.94s -> 6447.83s]  I need to add an angel here just so, just so it's very clear.
[6448.39s -> 6484.81s]  Because is that, is that soul? That could be its soul. There's a lot of meaning here.
[6484.81s -> 6504.97s]  Ready? Print it. Stamp it. Now let's get to real work. Let's go. Save the game.
[6507.61s -> 6529.69s]  Pea pants mod. Yes. Shoot it. All right. Uh, begin casting. We're good. We got everything
[6529.69s -> 6541.10s]  we need. I need the sets. I need the sets. I need Howard as the director. Okay.
[6542.30s -> 6572.55s]  I need sets. I need the pizzeria. I need hell. Pizzeria. Okay. Anything else?
[6575.11s -> 6586.04s]  Think I'm good. Ready to shoot. Shoot it. I know you're upset. You'll be fine.
[6588.20s -> 6593.16s]  Wait, wait. Tropical beach. Tropical beach. I need the wild west saloon. Hold on.
[6593.80s -> 6601.05s]  What the fuck is tropical beach for? I need heaven.
[6604.97s -> 6618.81s]  I gotta start deleting some stuff. Yeah. Let's delete this. Actually hold on. I need more space.
[6619.93s -> 6622.30s]  I need heaven.
[6628.38s -> 6645.29s]  I'm out of room. All right. I got to delete this. This shit's gotta go. How do I raise
[6645.29s -> 6653.83s]  a building? I know there's a way you can do it. I think I have to get a builder.
[6657.14s -> 6659.22s]  Yeah. I need a builder. I don't think I didn't have any.
[6663.93s -> 6676.78s]  I don't have one builder. All right. You come here. No. I have to go like this.
[6678.62s -> 6683.30s]  Delete. Thank you. Well, I didn't need that.
[6683.30s -> 6704.31s]  I got the pizzeria. Western saloon, right? Tropical beach and wild west saloon.
[6711.56s -> 6725.86s]  Wild west saloon. This is enormous. Can I just delete the scene that this is attached to?
[6726.58s -> 6785.00s]  I have to get rid of more buildings. Okay. That's it. That's it. Done. All right.
[6786.12s -> 6800.23s]  Save it. Pea pants mod. Here we go. It's ready to shoot. Let's hope the whole game doesn't break.
[6804.70s -> 6824.15s]  No, not PR. Shoot it. Three, two, one, go. We're being ruined.
[6831.54s -> 6835.62s]  No, this is the scenes. The scene placement doesn't matter because we can change it in editing.
[6837.51s -> 6841.99s]  No, if you weren't here in the last few streams, you don't. That doesn't matter.
[6845.27s -> 6860.73s]  All right. Here we go. Post production. This is where the fun begins. Fix it in post. That's
[6860.73s -> 6881.16s]  true. That is what we plan to do. It's so funny how this progressed to, oh, this is a funny idea.
[6881.16s -> 6887.54s]  Oh, yeah. Look, it's the burger thing. Look at this. How it fucked up. I'm terrified now.
[6888.18s -> 6900.26s]  I'm scared. I don't want to get in trouble. I got to change this. It progressed. But that's
[6900.26s -> 6903.30s]  what happens in the editing room. You figure out what you can and can't do and then you do
[6903.30s -> 6915.42s]  it. So first things first, the most important thing I would say is we need to move. We need
[6915.42s -> 6919.34s]  to do some rearranging and we're going to cut everything. What's the music, first of all?
[6920.62s -> 6953.51s]  It's actually kind of perfect. Okay, so this is way too long. Maybe I should start with
[6953.51s -> 6964.25s]  them just holding it. How long? This is like 40 seconds. This doesn't need to be this much.
[6964.25s -> 6996.31s]  I think it's right here. All right. No, no, no. We're going to do some inner cutting here
[6996.31s -> 6999.91s]  because this inner cutting is because this is like weird fucked up plans. I was like running
[6999.91s -> 7022.18s]  the restaurant in the ground. So like right here, we'll cut like, let's see, right here.
[7022.18s -> 7038.10s]  We're saved. So let's go like this. All right. Let's take a look how this looks.
[7049.74s -> 7101.98s]  Sooner. Sounds like sonic music. Bang. Money. Cut back. There it is. Paying the
[7101.98s -> 7114.58s]  ant right when it comes up in the air. I think right like here. I'd say right here.
[7114.58s -> 7124.58s]  Let's take a look. You're like right before it comes up. I think right here is safe
[7124.58s -> 7179.86s]  and that goes over here. Actually, I think it should be shorter. There it is. That's good.
[7179.86s -> 7197.46s]  Right there. The rest is now he gets in something. There's no getting people's faces too. I'm not
[7197.46s -> 7211.70s]  sure we even need that. I don't think we need him getting in somebody's face. Maybe a couple
[7211.70s -> 7222.84s]  more of those beats like right in everybody's face. Where's another one of those like
[7222.84s -> 7246.60s]  big hits? All right. Let's use the we got this one. It's right like here. Right. Bang. Right
[7246.60s -> 7258.49s]  there. Get rid of this portion. Just add it to the extended edition. Let's see what it
[7258.49s -> 7286.89s]  looks like if I just put it over here now. I don't understand. What is that? Oh no. It's
[7286.89s -> 7294.07s]  the song. It's the song. It's the song. You can't edit to. I forgot. You can't edit
[7294.95s -> 7304.25s]  to sounds and songs. I forgot because it changes everything. Yeah. I keep forgetting. I
[7304.25s -> 7326.95s]  can't treat this like final cut or premiere. This the song. It still works. No. It's still
[7326.95s -> 7336.09s]  fine. No. I don't like how that is. I think I want the close up one. Yeah. I want the
[7336.09s -> 7364.81s]  close up. Where's the close up when he gets right in his face? Right here. What is this
[7364.81s -> 7374.39s]  movie? This is a food store, a food, a restaurant that is in like trouble and
[7374.39s -> 7378.66s]  shit. And there's nothing to do with any restaurant you've already known about.
[7381.66s -> 7395.48s]  Well, I don't know. Where is it? Right here. There we go. All right. Let's see.
[7419.59s -> 7429.82s]  Oh yeah. These guys have to come in. I do want to have this one pop in somewhere too.
[7429.82s -> 7473.24s]  He's just constantly berating his employees. Let's cut it right there. Back to back.
[7490.90s -> 7494.54s]  I'm like doing it to the music and I shouldn't be. I don't know why this is
[7494.54s -> 7502.78s]  a music video. I don't know what I'm. I don't know why I'm doing that. It's just
[7502.78s -> 7539.86s]  becoming a music video. I don't know why I'm. I don't know why it just is. That's
[7539.86s -> 7563.66s]  where it's going. Okay. Now they come in. This has to be like right here. Looks good.
[7563.66s -> 7617.40s]  They walk in. It's not perfect. It's not perfect, but like it's hard to edit with this
[7617.40s -> 7623.80s]  timeline, but I think it's pretty good. I like this like West side story type intro.
[7623.80s -> 7642.04s]  By the way, he's serving him poison. Everybody catching that?
[7667.62s -> 7685.98s]  Everyone's like sits down and starts like eating and choking. Let's get rid of this.
[7685.98s -> 7716.95s]  Let's see. How does it be together so far? You can already start to hear people coughing.
[7731.40s -> 7742.94s]  Boom. Like food. I think this is wasted space here. I'm going to save it just in case. Well,
[7742.94s -> 7748.10s]  I'm going to actually save it. I don't think we need all this.
[7749.72s -> 7764.12s]  We definitely need this though. I need this over here.
[7767.70s -> 7816.10s]  Let's keep this clip for when we need it. I'm going to put so much like somebody fucking
[7816.10s -> 7825.88s]  sneezes and shit back here. Wait, she goes back to eating after that.
[7850.52s -> 7891.75s]  It matches perfectly. All right. Need another one. And cut to them ordering right here.
[7891.75s -> 7921.14s]  I will take this please. This is not even a central character. Why do we care?
[7936.92s -> 7958.89s]  What is going on on the left side of the screen? There we go. Right here. Right when it
[7958.89s -> 7973.45s]  goes in, like in the mouth, like right here. What the hell does he do back here?
[7973.45s -> 7979.94s]  Oh, he's just cleaning the bar. It goes here.
[7983.38s -> 7998.63s]  All right. I think that's, I don't think we need any more of that. Let's watch it from here.
[8031.03s -> 8072.30s]  Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait. I'm just tending bar. Is he in his pants? Is he daydreaming?
[8072.30s -> 8085.03s]  He's daydreaming. All right. Let's see how this looks over here. It was right here.
[8097.67s -> 8100.71s]  Sometimes the music feels like it doesn't line up the way it did previously.
[8101.75s -> 8104.87s]  You know what I'm saying? Because I have to cut more off the snow.
[8106.22s -> 8109.74s]  It's not going to be perfect, but it'll still be funny. Right? It'll still be fun.
[8156.55s -> 8167.98s]  And he's like, oh my God. He's self-serving. Okay. This is where he doesn't notice people
[8167.98s -> 8196.79s]  are coughing. And this is when they leave. That looks good. Because what's going to happen
[8196.79s -> 8209.74s]  here is it's going to be like bang. Like what the fuck is that? New music? Well,
[8209.74s -> 8216.89s]  this is not going to be a music video anymore as of like once the song is over. And we're almost
[8216.89s -> 8230.46s]  at, this is almost dead. Okay. Somebody gets like, okay, what's going on here?
[8231.18s -> 8235.50s]  Something else happens. Yeah. They go, they leave. Like, I don't like this place.
[8235.50s -> 8244.78s]  Oh, then there's like a fucking huge fight here. Everyone leaves. Why is he sleeping?
[8246.81s -> 8249.77s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I should probably put this.
[8250.57s -> 8284.76s]  Hold on. He can't be doing both things. He can't be doing both at the same time.
[8299.83s -> 8308.26s]  It's a dream? No, but he, okay, he's tending bar, but he wasn't actually, he's asleep here.
[8308.26s -> 8318.52s]  So these two things didn't happen. This is happening. So then why would he be daydreaming
[8318.52s -> 8328.12s]  about himself sleeping, dreaming about himself on the beach, which is a daydream of him tending bar?
[8328.12s -> 8359.32s]  Why would he be doing this? That doesn't make any sense. Why would he be daydreaming that?
[8359.32s -> 8386.65s]  Hold on. What do you do? Okay. That's about it. That's going to be quicker.
[8389.88s -> 8418.63s]  Right here. All right. I think that's better. Okay. So here's the cough.
[8419.51s -> 8437.77s]  Make sure I got it in the right spot. Yeah, I do. Somebody has to choke this.
[8437.77s -> 8443.45s]  Yeah, this one right here. So we don't need this guy anymore.
[8443.45s -> 8447.59s]  We got a great shot of him already. Just put a transition in for the dream.
[8448.66s -> 8455.29s]  Yeah, but which one is the dream? Yeah, we don't need that anymore.
[8455.93s -> 8479.58s]  So that brings us to here. So this is a daydream of, this is so fucking odd.
[8479.58s -> 8511.82s]  Okay. So fade out, fade in. So this is the daydream, but this is him sleeping.
[8511.82s -> 8521.18s]  But this is also a daydream at the end here. You understand?
[8522.62s -> 8559.74s]  Save it. Save it. Save it. I will. Let's flip these. No. All right. I like it.
[8559.74s -> 8564.02s]  This is like too much. I liked this better when it was just him sitting there
[8564.02s -> 8574.82s]  daydreaming about himself serving himself a drink. This gets too meta.
[8578.65s -> 8586.81s]  Yeah, it's out. It's out. But I'm not going to delete it though,
[8586.81s -> 8598.95s]  because what if I want it somewhere? Okay. So let's see what I got.
[8598.95s -> 8633.26s]  I'm taking off the fades too. So it needs to come in a little quicker here.
[8633.26s -> 8674.42s]  Okay. It's fine, but the king sleeping cannot be here. This is the argument.
[8674.42s -> 8700.30s]  So let's put this over here. Keep it. Keep it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[8700.30s -> 8706.70s]  Cough, cough, getting out, sleeping and getting out. Let's just see how it looks.
[8706.70s -> 8716.57s]  I want to give it a try and get these transitions off though. Okay.
[8735.86s -> 8739.30s]  Why? He goes. Oh, this part sucks.
[8740.18s -> 8749.19s]  All right. What else happens? There's the big fight and then the...
[8751.98s -> 8755.26s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. No, excuse me.
[8755.26s -> 8758.06s]  He's going to smoke just in the restaurant and more people are going to leave.
[8768.54s -> 8814.28s]  And then he gets confronted. Are the people still in the restaurant?
[8821.62s -> 8824.42s]  Oh yeah. The person that really likes the food. I forgot. Yeah. She likes...
[8824.42s -> 8828.70s]  Wolfs it down. All right. Yeah. That has to be intercut somewhere in between the fight.
[8829.26s -> 8834.26s]  No, we already have him drinking poison and dying. We don't need like another
[8834.26s -> 8840.06s]  death scene for the king. Yeah, I can get rid of this. This is a, this is a,
[8840.06s -> 8847.00s]  I got what I wanted from it. I don't need it. I have poison death.
[8851.66s -> 8860.17s]  Okay. So this is where we need to start to figure out how, let me just see how this looks.
[8870.60s -> 8882.07s]  Oh my God. That's, that looks just awful. It's just awful, but I don't think I want to change
[8882.07s -> 8891.22s]  it. All right. What else? Oh yeah. What else can I put here? Wait, they come back in?
[8892.84s -> 8902.31s]  Who comes in? Why do people come back in? Is it too cold outside? Are these the same people
[8902.31s -> 8932.07s]  that left? No. Are these the cops? I forgot about this shit. Okay. Then. All right. All
[8932.07s -> 8936.98s]  right. All right. All right. So let's do this one by one here. Argument. People come. Then
[8936.98s -> 8955.85s]  okay. That gives me a transitional piece. Here they come. And then we get the shove
[8960.42s -> 8971.16s]  right here. So I don't need this portion here. I got this and then they're going to fight.
[8971.16s -> 8998.95s]  Let's get rid of that. In come the people enter cold. That is not long enough at all.
[9000.07s -> 9018.20s]  We're almost at the end of the song. What the hell do I do now that the song is over?
[9025.42s -> 9039.37s]  All right. Now, right when the first punch is thrown, that's when we get the like action
[9039.37s -> 9055.45s]  song. So like, this is fine. Let's go like. You want it? Let's see if it fits.
[9063.67s -> 9065.19s]  No, it's got to come in when they're arguing.
[9065.19s -> 9106.26s]  Someone kicked to the jukebox. I don't think it fits. We need something quicker.
[9106.82s -> 9116.73s]  We need something that comes in quicker. Sorry, guys. I tried.
[9149.43s -> 9152.97s]  That's too quick. It would have to be something like this.
[9152.97s -> 9203.91s]  It escalates in a thousand percent. We need her eating, like eating the food like really,
[9203.91s -> 9214.28s]  really fast. This will match with this song too. I think her like, let's see.
[9223.48s -> 9261.62s]  Yeah, like cut it right here. So like you think that she throws up right into the camera.
[9312.73s -> 9314.71s]  This is this is a run.
[9314.71s -> 9367.59s]  I think it's just, oh, I hold on. Let me see how this looks.
[9384.22s -> 9390.74s]  Cyanide, zero with 10 community subs. Thank you. Thank you so much for the 10
[9390.74s -> 9400.58s]  fucking subs. A lot of community subs tonight. Today, should I say? All right,
[9400.58s -> 9407.32s]  get me in here. What does it need to be? I'm thinking like the wicked dumb run
[9408.04s -> 9411.64s]  and then instantly throw them out the window and then the eating and then like the puking.
[9420.74s -> 9444.38s]  I don't need this anymore then. Is that is it? How is that stupid?
[9463.72s -> 9466.60s]  Kick before out the window. That's true.
[9469.02s -> 9477.08s]  Yeah, it could do. Oh, I hold on.
[9477.56s -> 9484.62s]  I need to cut this in half. Bang, right here. That should be enough to make him go out the
[9484.62s -> 9499.66s]  window. How does he get in front of him like this? Actually, it kind of works because he's
[9499.66s -> 9520.34s]  behind him. What window is he going out of? This one? He's going out of one of these side
[9521.14s -> 9560.68s]  windows. Let's see. Let's move some stuff around. See if it looks better like this.
[9572.31s -> 9580.09s]  Oh, that's great.
[9593.86s -> 9613.80s]  Okay, now we have, how the hell am I going to do this? Yeah, new, I got to get new music
[9614.68s -> 9618.04s]  let's play this. Let me see how this plays out from like here.
[9693.13s -> 9713.59s]  Oh my god. All right, we are about, I'd say 40% of the way there. The best is yet to come,
[9713.59s -> 9719.00s]  if you could believe that. Delete the sleeping and messes with the sink.
[9722.34s -> 9729.34s]  Uh, here's the unfortunate thing. And I figured out how this game works. So when you play from
[9729.34s -> 9735.69s]  any part of the timeline, it has to load the music separately. All the sounds are loaded
[9735.69s -> 9743.85s]  separately. So sometimes it just puts itself out of sync. Unfortunately, no matter if you move
[9743.85s -> 9757.80s]  anything around, it's like rendering two things at the same time. It's weird. Because if I
[9757.80s -> 9768.20s]  delete this, the whole thing will squish down and the music too. It's really hard to actually
[9768.20s -> 9774.98s]  get anything in sync in the movies, especially if you have a lot of sounds. Yeah, I got it. I
[9774.98s -> 9781.48s]  saved it. I got it. I'm good. All right, let me, let me take this opportunity. It's been
[9781.48s -> 9787.08s]  about three hours. Let me go, I'm going to go pee. So I got it saved. We're about 40%
[9787.08s -> 9791.83s]  of the way. Maybe a little bit more. I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back and
[9791.83s -> 9977.30s]  we'll continue this, uh, absolute atrocity of cinema. See you in a minute. Hey, I'm back.
[9977.30s -> 9979.90s]  All right. So we've got
[9996.76s -> 10011.98s]  the music can now change to like, here comes a situation where a guy's coming in to sneak and
[10011.98s -> 10021.70s]  take pictures of the restaurant, right? Because that's what comes up next. But then
[10021.70s -> 10026.57s]  he immediately just falls down and then they hold him down and beat him up. And he's supposed to be
[10027.37s -> 10035.70s]  he's dead here, right? Oh, and then the, then they come in with the, the police come in
[10036.70s -> 10044.23s]  and he's sitting in a rocket. How am I going to do with this? Why does the ant go to heaven
[10044.23s -> 10062.12s]  again? Well, you'll see. You'll see very shortly. All right. So let's back it up.
[10062.12s -> 10067.37s]  Let's get this out of here because I don't think I need that. Wait, maybe just one quick.
[10068.33s -> 10103.70s]  Let's go like this. The guy with the Ghostbusters
[10104.26s -> 10123.96s]  ecto gun thing. All right. Let's go with, hmm, how about eerie house? See how that looks.
[10156.82s -> 10167.00s]  Well, we don't need all this. We just need this. Like what the fuck are you doing here?
[10174.28s -> 10202.30s]  Mom, I got to call you back. Uh, something just went down in the pizzeria.
[10203.90s -> 10218.10s]  In fact, can you like come fucking pick me up? All right. Let's, so first of all, he comes in,
[10223.75s -> 10227.11s]  maybe he should, it should like, he steps on it here. You know what I'm saying?
[10227.67s -> 10255.46s]  At this moment, this is like too much lead in room. I mean, do, do I just not give a shit
[10255.46s -> 10271.67s]  and have this happen like this? What if he just walks in and they grab him? Let me see what happens
[10271.67s -> 10290.62s]  if he just walks in with his health inspector radar gun and then they just grab him. This guy
[10290.62s -> 10335.90s]  didn't even do anything. He's the health inspector. Just having new music. This is
[10335.90s -> 10341.62s]  like, this is like not, not nice movie. This is like, this is bad. This is just mean and
[10342.02s -> 10396.76s]  Oh my God. Settle down. Oh, okay. This is back here. I need another song though. We need something.
[10398.82s -> 10412.14s]  Hmm. Fantasy battle. Femme fatale. Give me 24 hours. Haunted house. What's this one called
[10412.22s -> 10429.30s]  again? A lone fight. Haunted house. Let's give this one a try. Oh, not that far. Too far.
[10429.30s -> 10446.71s]  Like right here. Actually it's in the right spot. This, I already had this one on here.
[10447.43s -> 10450.47s]  No, this is not, this is eerie house, not haunted house.
[10450.79s -> 10525.69s]  Hold on. No, that doesn't, it keep going. That's, I kind of like, oh, stupid. That isn't a problem.
[10543.70s -> 10572.34s]  All right. I don't think we need the banana peel. Yeah. These two scenes can go,
[10573.14s -> 10580.63s]  but after that is the kind of the panic, right? Yeah. We just killed the guy.
[10580.63s -> 10623.72s]  Panic, right? It goes here. Nope. No, no, no. Wrong spot. Wrong spot. Here. Hold on,
[10623.72s -> 10625.96s]  hold on. I can, I'm going to, I'm just going to move these around.
[10643.30s -> 10672.94s]  Wait a second. Did they, the clothes switched? Oh well. Okay. We need, it needs to be on that
[10672.94s -> 10707.27s]  same beat. Come on, you little twig. See if that adds a little bit to it.
[10707.27s -> 10730.38s]  It's not long enough. Actually it might fit if I do this. This, just delete these. I'm not going
[10730.38s -> 10740.66s]  to use the banana peel. There's no reason to use it. It's just kind of wasted space here. Although
[10740.66s -> 10743.46s]  hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[10743.46s -> 10762.90s]  Wait just a second here. I like that reaction from the ant. I like that. That's motivation
[10762.90s -> 10796.12s]  there. I like it. Kill him. Bang. Right here. The ant is like, oh fuck, this is not good.
[10796.20s -> 10807.98s]  Right, right here. Although he switches sides, unfortunately. Let's see if it looks, let's see
[10807.98s -> 10851.48s]  how it looks. Hold on, let's see. No, no, no. Wait, wait, what? I shouldn't have done that.
[10856.31s -> 10876.07s]  I could put it, hold on, let me see. Yeah, maybe before, before the attack. That's not a bad
[10876.07s -> 10880.87s]  idea because he doesn't want to do it and he tried. Hold on, let's see. Let's just take
[10880.87s -> 10915.82s]  a look and see how it looks. It's perfect. He wants nothing to do with it. He has a conscience.
[10921.18s -> 10924.46s]  I like it both ways. I like it. He has it. He's like, I don't want to do that.
[10924.46s -> 10928.78s]  He's like, oh no, someone's here, but ready? Check this out. Like here comes a health inspector
[10928.78s -> 10934.76s]  and then you've got, he knows what's going to happen. Like, oh no. And he's, now I have to
[10934.76s -> 10943.27s]  go do this. The other way is we did it and then, oh no, we did that. We should not have
[10943.27s -> 10976.47s]  done that. Hmm. Hmm. It's tricky. Yeah, it's, it's, I like it this way. You can even see
[10977.35s -> 10990.55s]  shaking his head left and right. No. Oh, fuck. What if we don't, what if we don't know?
[10995.64s -> 11008.10s]  This is a little too long. Wait, wait, wait. Back, back, back, back, back.
[11013.51s -> 11018.23s]  Right there. It looks all right. No, but we get the, no, I like, I like the king
[11018.23s -> 11045.06s]  like doing like the, you're dead. We'll just come in here. It's like a tiny little piece
[11045.06s -> 11056.04s]  that's just sticking out here. Who the hell is it? The best part is how he says,
[11057.37s -> 11064.22s]  you're dead. And he like thinks it's great. And then instantly with his hand still going down,
[11064.22s -> 11072.52s]  goes, oh, whoops. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're dead. Hand still in the air. He
[11072.52s -> 11105.96s]  immediately comes down into, oh fuck. What have I done? It's gotta be right. It's gotta be
[11105.96s -> 11119.18s]  right here. Let's just see, make sure it's correct. Yeah. Killer beast. Yeah. Oh.
[11126.60s -> 11142.57s]  Perfect. What people say in voice acting. I don't think I want to voice act this one.
[11143.37s -> 11149.24s]  I think it's perfectly fine as a silent film. I think it speaks. The whole thing speaks
[11149.24s -> 11193.83s]  already. All right. We're, we're almost done. Pretty perfect. All right. Moving on. Save it.
[11193.83s -> 11207.48s]  You got it. Got to go in and get rid of this one. Where is it? Come here. There's another
[11207.48s -> 11215.21s]  little, just tiny little piece somewhere. Where is it? Oh no, it's just this. This
[11215.21s -> 11221.18s]  can get out of here. We don't need this anymore. He said now he's just waiting. Yeah,
[11221.18s -> 11251.51s]  he's waiting. Okay. We're going to do some intercutting here. He stands up. Ant is like
[11251.51s -> 11273.43s]  going out the back. I don't need this anymore. We got the ant sneaking out the back. Okay. I can
[11273.43s -> 11286.55s]  pull this back out. Um, we'll go two. Sounds good. There you go. So I need to bring this
[11287.94s -> 11293.99s]  here. Yeah. The ant's like on his way out. What are you doing? What the hell was that?
[11298.63s -> 11355.46s]  I gotta get out of here. Which way? Which way? Okay. Hold on. Hold on. This is the big,
[11355.46s -> 11358.26s]  this is the shot here. This is the shot that matters.
[11405.43s -> 11432.78s]  Why would you try to escape like this? He does it with his trash.
[11438.10s -> 11454.47s]  He does it with his like fall. That's so funny. He even looks back. Why would you
[11454.47s -> 11464.41s]  think it was full of stuff to break your fall? Doesn't make any sense.
[11465.54s -> 11475.08s]  Okay. Um, he already is dead. All right. Hold on. This is now, you gotta move this over here.
[11478.94s -> 11488.89s]  Oh, my fucking stomach. Okay. And then this is where the throw happens. So I gotta get this
[11488.89s -> 11505.86s]  right. So like right here. Let's go put this over there. Oh, this is gonna be, I'm gonna
[11505.86s -> 11529.86s]  fucking, is it gonna hurt? I already know it's gonna hurt. I already know. Okay. Hold on.
[11529.86s -> 11615.21s]  I gotta get in close for this. I think I need that. I'm gonna cut it. I'm just gonna see what
[11615.21s -> 11617.93s]  it looks like. I'm not gonna remove it, but I just need to move it to here.
[11646.87s -> 11670.12s]  It's so, it needs to be like right there. Okay. There it is. I think I got it. That's so
[11670.12s -> 11694.57s]  horrible. It's so fucking horrible. Wait, hold on. Let me pull this one back. Get over
[11694.57s -> 11716.89s]  here. Get over there. It's so small. I can't grab it. I just, I want that little piece
[11716.89s -> 11729.03s]  right there. Shit. Is it, I think it might be too small. It's alright. It's, it's perfect
[11729.03s -> 11749.21s]  the way it is, but I'm just trying to make it over perfect. Just move everything to the right.
[11749.21s -> 11764.52s]  Hold on. Let me see. I could just do that and then I need it to be here. This can,
[11764.52s -> 11768.71s]  are these too small to move? These might be too small to move too. I guess they are.
[11771.11s -> 11779.62s]  Too small to move. Now we gotta keep, we gotta keep it the way it was. Wait, hold on.
[11780.58s -> 11801.88s]  It's better the other way. Look at that, right? God, that's fucking so horrible.
[11802.92s -> 11806.30s]  That's just horrible. It's just, this is like you throwing something over about and into a
[11806.30s -> 11818.15s]  dumpster. Okay, then I can just delete these. Can I even delete these or is this just gonna
[11818.15s -> 11830.31s]  be at the end of the movie forever? No, I can delete them. Make sure this is actually
[11830.31s -> 11854.73s]  gonna delete this. Right? That's, I'm on that scene, right? Okay, good. Alright, we're good.
[11854.73s -> 11858.73s]  I love this one so much though. The original is always going to be my favorite because it's the
[11858.73s -> 11874.94s]  ant and he's trying to escape. He's so dumb. He just doesn't understand. Alright, now we need
[11874.94s -> 11884.87s]  hell. Let's zoom back out. Let's go with two pumps in there. Alright, hell. This is where
[11884.87s -> 11904.22s]  he wakes up. He wakes up in hell and then he gets chased by the monsters. Let's see how this
[11904.22s -> 11924.62s]  looks. That scene can be deleted. Yeah, I'm gonna use different music. I'm just trying
[11924.62s -> 11954.79s]  to get it in the right spot. It's done. Now we just have to make it, we just have to fine-tune it.
[11970.22s -> 12005.32s]  Alright, perfect. Post-credits scene. I can't do post-credits on foot. Yes, I can. Oh, why not?
[12005.32s -> 12026.44s]  No, he's dead. He's, he's very dead. It's, he's dead. No, no, no, no, he's dead. He's dead.
[12026.44s -> 12044.49s]  That cheapens, that cheapens the fall if he's alive. He's dead. That cheapens the fall.
[12044.49s -> 12052.62s]  Look, he can do, we can do an ant in heaven movie. Alright, it's done. Now we have to
[12052.62s -> 12058.26s]  change music, add some sound effects, and print the damn thing. This is almost, this is three
[12058.26s -> 12071.40s]  and a half minutes long. You just dropped it a whole letter grade. Alright, so let's go back to
[12071.40s -> 12104.17s]  here. This is fine. This is, right? This is like the music video, right? We get, we gotta
[12104.17s -> 12114.18s]  add some like, some song in here. No, song. Uh, some sound effects. I'm thinking just,
[12114.18s -> 12124.02s]  just like yells and shit and like anger. There's gonna be tons of coughing. Yeah,
[12124.02s -> 12138.34s]  this is gonna get, I'm not gonna overdo it. Breathe heavy. Let's put that over here.
[12139.06s -> 12142.02s]  Yeah, he gets right in his face and like breathes in his face.
[12150.38s -> 12175.00s]  Another breathe heavy? Or maybe like a, is it like an anger? Yawn? Slurps? No, no slurps.
[12175.72s -> 12186.76s]  We're gonna add those later. Scream. How about just like, just like a little like,
[12189.66s -> 12190.38s]  that's not really,
[12195.91s -> 12205.77s]  I always put scream one. What, I didn't know what scream two is. I don't think I've ever
[12205.77s -> 12231.64s]  touched it. Right. There's probably two because it has two chest bumps forward.
[12232.36s -> 12255.35s]  Let's do scream two. Scream three. No, I'm not adding that. Let's just see what it does.
[12271.93s -> 12276.41s]  All right, I gotta ask, does, does this ruin the music video portion?
[12279.77s -> 12296.62s]  Yes, it does. It does. So I don't need anything here. Yeah, we don't need anything here.
[12297.26s -> 12343.93s]  This is like good. Good. I'm gonna emphasize these though. Double cough.
[12352.62s -> 12390.42s]  I don't like this one. I'm not sure it needs it here. I don't think it needs it. So let's add,
[12390.42s -> 12477.51s]  let's add like a puke sound here. What was that? All right. Am I George Lucas-ing?
[12485.56s -> 12491.80s]  The puke would sound perfect with the music. Just hold on. Like,
[12493.56s -> 12516.79s]  hold on, I gotta get the right spot. This way. Come on. Damn it. Damn it.
[12516.87s -> 12645.43s]  Got it. Why'd it change? I had it right. I had it. Okay, hold on. Okay. I'll meet you. I'm gonna
[12645.43s -> 12652.81s]  meet you guys halfway here. I'm gonna meet you halfway. This shouldn't be here because
[12653.90s -> 12659.50s]  it, this is a big deal. This is like the everyone starts to leave and it doesn't match
[12659.50s -> 12665.00s]  up with the music. But this is like the, somebody pukes behind us and we're going to
[12665.08s -> 12719.66s]  leave. Let's see. It kind of like ruins the, I like that because, yeah, let's delete this one.
[12719.66s -> 12723.74s]  It ruins this whole music video. And it's like, well, hold on a minute. People are like,
[12723.74s -> 12735.26s]  something's wrong with somebody back there. This is not good. I don't think I'll ever,
[12736.25s -> 12740.33s]  I'm never going to grow up. This is never going to happen. I'm sorry. This is not going
[12740.33s -> 12758.39s]  to happen. I really don't think so. Change, change the music here. Like, oh wait. Oh,
[12758.39s -> 12764.23s]  okay. Hold on a minute. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is important
[12764.23s -> 12782.18s]  because I need a song that can be, I can't, I don't think I can because I have the music
[12782.18s -> 12799.88s]  all blocked out already. Imagine if you were sitting at a restaurant and you had just ordered.
[12799.88s -> 12808.86s]  You gave your order to the giant aunt. That's red flag number one. And then you hear that.
[12808.86s -> 12813.35s]  Apparently like whoever this is, they don't really mind. You look at this is just like,
[12813.35s -> 12821.00s]  excuse me. What is going on back there? All right. Let's play. Keep going.
[12827.85s -> 12853.18s]  We need like a big sniff here. You know what I mean? Like watch his eyes. It matches with
[12853.18s -> 12873.18s]  his eyes blinking. No, he doesn't. I don't think there's another one.
[12895.66s -> 12899.13s]  Okay. There's like, there's some changes that need to be made here
[12899.85s -> 12903.21s]  because this, this music just kind of, this music needs to come in sooner.
[12907.61s -> 12912.58s]  No, no, no, it doesn't. It can't. It matches up too perfectly here with her eating.
[12916.47s -> 12921.45s]  Is there like a sound I can make? Once I start fucking with George Lucas audio here
[12922.17s -> 12925.69s]  is when I've made a bunch of mistakes in the last one. I don't want to do that now.
[12926.25s -> 12933.46s]  Let me think. Hold on. What about just like horror sounds?
[12934.86s -> 12956.76s]  Is there like scary sounds you put in silence? Unfortunately, no. That is the one
[12958.46s -> 12964.38s]  large downfall to the movies is they were smart enough to put a timeline editor in here.
[12964.38s -> 12970.70s]  And it's really, really, really fun to use, but you can't individually edit audio files.
[12971.66s -> 12977.50s]  This is just for the whole track. You can't make it per audio clip. You have, there's
[12977.50s -> 12983.77s]  no muting. It's just, if you put a song in here, it does the whole thing.
[12983.77s -> 12989.96s]  And all importing silence would do is just layer on top because it just keeps whatever
[12989.96s -> 13006.15s]  is underneath it too. Unfortunately, add bone crunches, edit the song in audacity and then
[13006.15s -> 13017.42s]  import it. I mean, you know what? That could work, but I would need to do it to every
[13017.42s -> 13022.22s]  single song. And that would take, I mean, that would take a significant portion of time
[13022.22s -> 13030.02s]  for me. I mean, we're currently live right now. That's a lot of work for what is effectively
[13031.96s -> 13044.10s]  an ant falling into a dumpster. Just add a new song that's silence.
[13045.00s -> 13050.87s]  Well, it'll just layer on top. Put in a record scratch.
[13052.79s -> 13063.69s]  All right, let's see. Dirt falling, metal, pour, splash, phone ring, toilet flush?
[13066.06s -> 13075.58s]  Maybe this should be a toilet flush somewhere. Fire extinguisher. I don't know if there's a
[13075.58s -> 13096.06s]  phone ringing. He's George Lucas-ing. He's George Lucas-ing. Let's see. Human sounds.
[13104.66s -> 13107.94s]  I can click them. Yeah. Somebody told me I could double click them and it would play.
[13107.94s -> 13115.77s]  That person is a fucking saint. All right. Violent sounds.
[13116.17s -> 13143.75s]  Play some of those dialogues. No, I actually, I tried to bring in a, a song. I tried to bring
[13143.75s -> 13147.83s]  in a laugh track and it crashed the game. And we all know what happened the last time
[13147.83s -> 13153.30s]  this game crashed. It screwed up everything and I had to re-edit everything. So I am
[13153.30s -> 13161.54s]  not leaving this screen. Not again. Because even saving it, those of you that weren't here
[13161.54s -> 13166.90s]  last time, this doesn't save everything. It just saves this weird kind of configuration
[13167.30s -> 13175.27s]  file that keeps the audio and what clips you use. It does not keep all the edits to the clips.
[13175.83s -> 13181.59s]  So this is like a, if this is like a crash, it's literally like a landmine. I'm holding
[13181.59s -> 13192.60s]  on top. I'm holding a landmine right now. All right. But anyways, um, what the hell?
[13192.60s -> 13204.30s]  How am I going to, I need like an electrical sound. Okay. Alarm. ATM. Hey, that's,
[13207.78s -> 13212.98s]  that's like, uh, no, uh, uh, don't think so.
[13218.33s -> 13235.75s]  There's no record scratch. Let me just see.
[13247.00s -> 13251.11s]  Was it a metal detector? What is it detecting?
[13259.70s -> 13265.74s]  That's really loud. It's just letting you know somebody came in.
[13269.02s -> 13280.30s]  That's not going to work. Hold on.
[13306.57s -> 13316.04s]  Are they groceries?
[13330.17s -> 13332.09s]  Is that like a barcode on their leg of heads?
[13340.42s -> 13344.66s]  I need like a wham. I need something to do something violent. That's just
[13344.66s -> 13346.98s]  says shit is going down right now.
[13352.57s -> 13362.41s]  No, but that's like a, that's like a YouTuber thing. They put like that. Oh, look,
[13362.49s -> 13371.19s]  the camera zoomed in and two tenths of a second on my face. Hey, what? What? No,
[13371.19s -> 13384.78s]  I'm not doing that. Guys, can we hit 200,000 likes? Can you? I don't think we can.
[13385.80s -> 13411.70s]  Yes, we can. He shattered his rib cage. He's got like a bunch of expensive
[13412.02s -> 13421.27s]  glass and watches in his bag. Shattered his ribs.
[13476.44s -> 13479.48s]  No, no, no, too much, too much, too much, too much, too much.
[13480.12s -> 13485.64s]  Too much. Too much. No, don't. That's fine the way it is. I don't need anymore.
[13531.11s -> 13560.73s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13589.42s -> 13602.30s]  This is, this needs to come in sooner. I think I'm going to, I'm just going to put this here.
[13602.30s -> 13608.79s]  So everyone in chat quiets down. It's going to be removed, but I'll put it in there for one.
[13608.79s -> 13655.13s]  Just you get one shot. You get one take. You get one. Disgusting. Revolting. This is,
[13655.13s -> 13666.90s]  that's just a disgusting person. Shoveling food down your throat. Perfect.
[13676.86s -> 13689.02s]  Oh my God. The game is so loud. I know. I know. I can't turn it down. I have to go
[13689.02s -> 13693.35s]  like into the source and turn it down. Hold on. But I can't, I'm so, I'm just,
[13693.91s -> 13699.19s]  just, just turn me down. I'm so afraid to alt tab this game. I just am. I'm terrified
[13699.19s -> 13702.71s]  to because the last time I've been doing that I crashed it and then we lost everything.
[13702.71s -> 13706.79s]  So I'm sorry, but turn your volume down just a little. I'm sorry that I can't do anything for
[13706.79s -> 13728.02s]  it. Okay. Where am I? Here. Okay. Yeah. The volume sliders, but I have to remember to turn
[13728.02s -> 13734.49s]  these back up. Unfortunately, it's only for what is recorded here. As you'll see,
[13735.37s -> 13741.13s]  it doesn't affect any of the stuff in the actual scene. Only affects the music and the
[13741.13s -> 13748.10s]  sound effects I'm putting in. So for instance, like when, when they have,
[13748.10s -> 13751.06s]  when he gets pitted through the glass, it's not a sound effect I put in.
[13752.02s -> 13759.06s]  So I can't, I can't lower it. Unfortunately. Okay. We need a transition. We need something
[13759.06s -> 13786.31s]  to happen. I want to pull this, but it's the shift in music between the scene transition
[13786.31s -> 13792.87s]  sucks. Yeah. But the, I, I, if, if, if this were like premiere or final cut, you know,
[13792.87s -> 13799.11s]  I would put transitions and spread them out and crop them up, but you have to have music
[13799.11s -> 13807.61s]  on top of music unless I go into audacity and rerecord every single song. So I wish I could
[13807.61s -> 13814.71s]  do that, but yeah, you use the tools. A craftsman only blames his tools if they don't work
[13814.71s -> 13840.01s]  as intended out of the box. What was that? Oh shit. Is it like a little ant sound
[13840.57s -> 13847.11s]  this is like a little I'm concerned sound nature and animal sounds.
[13863.67s -> 13870.33s]  Just get a real animal. I don't know. I never understand this.
[13870.97s -> 13877.85s]  This is just a person going, Oh, just record an animal. Just pull it from like a nature website.
[13882.71s -> 13887.78s]  Oh, wait a minute. I think we found out transition.
[13887.78s -> 13953.59s]  I wish I could just shut this off right here. No, I think it's when they're panicking
[13972.26s -> 13974.42s]  thunder kick, thunder knee.
[14013.88s -> 14036.30s]  It's Zeus. Yes. That is who this is. That's who you that's who's on the screen right now.
[14036.30s -> 14041.21s]  That's who it's always been. And I'm talking even four hours ago. It's been Zeus.
[14043.94s -> 14052.38s]  Please just please keep that in mind. It has never been anybody else.
[14052.38s -> 14058.74s]  All right. Um, this is all right. I want to add some like creaking sounds
[14061.27s -> 14135.26s]  just like that. It wasn't for the beginning part. Jesus. Hey, why would you do that?
[14135.26s -> 14154.92s]  I, why would you do that? I want to click this. All right. Fine game.
[14154.92s -> 14190.33s]  No, it's not even necessary. I don't think it's necessary.
[14190.89s -> 14216.23s]  That's fine. The two is too much. Thunder knee. I know, I know, I know. I'm going,
[14216.23s -> 14238.26s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm getting it. We need a police siren. Lower your volume.
[14238.26s -> 14266.74s]  Hope you did. Damn it. Miscellaneous maybe. Is it no siren? No, I thought I saw one.
[14266.74s -> 14270.46s]  They're like, uh, no, that's, I thought that's a patrol car.
[14271.02s -> 14297.91s]  That is that as close as I'm going to get. All right. Stop.
[14297.91s -> 14299.99s]  I got one shot here because I can't move it anywhere else.
[14299.99s -> 14373.80s]  Another puke. Here we go. That's my favorite one.
[14387.66s -> 14399.61s]  Okay. We need music. So it needs to be, oh my God. Okay. So bang. Right when it changes,
[14399.69s -> 14428.34s]  new music. I can't come in. Why can I not add new music? I'm full. Oh, I can zoom out. Okay.
[14429.14s -> 14433.14s]  We need, we need where's the, what's it called? The one from when I did this like three years
[14433.14s -> 14463.51s]  ago, happy stride. That's the one. It has to be this in the perfect cut. Here we go. Let's
[14463.51s -> 14483.82s]  see. Shit. It's gotta be a little bit further because it transitions between them.
[14483.82s -> 14532.74s]  Okay. Now we cut to new music back to haunted house. That's so fucking funny.
[14539.64s -> 14555.05s]  Keep it. Hold on. Let me, let me just see what happens when I do this.
[14556.89s -> 14578.95s]  Well, okay. I'm going to, I'll play it out with it on. Let's see. No,
[14579.91s -> 14587.32s]  no, it's not going to have it like that. We need to cut back from happy stride again
[14587.32s -> 14590.92s]  at a good cut. And then hell is going to be like heavy metal music.
[14594.34s -> 14651.50s]  And then we're done and we can save it and we can watch it closer. It's close a little bit earlier.
[14652.06s -> 14693.14s]  It's going to have to be, yeah. All right. That's fine. We can go back to turning these
[14693.14s -> 14710.78s]  up again. All right. We're good. I don't know why I forgot that that happens.
[14717.61s -> 14729.72s]  I somehow forgot that's what, how this ends. Come on, pull it out.
[14733.62s -> 14779.99s]  Ah, no. Why? No, I need the music. I can't preview these. Oh, that's unfortunate.
[14783.88s -> 14798.25s]  Does anybody know off hand if there's a, like a heavy metal, the last stand,
[14799.75s -> 14814.89s]  the art of war, the last stand. We'll try it. Oh man. Once I get this one. Okay. I gotta,
[14814.89s -> 14825.08s]  I have to go back and redo these. That's perfect. I just got 10 more community subs
[14825.08s -> 14841.06s]  came in from cyanide. Thank you so much cyanide. 10 more subs from cyanide. You are too kind.
[14841.62s -> 14887.64s]  It's right here. Shit. It's not, it's fine. Oh, it really is not good, but I have to change
[14887.64s -> 14902.50s]  it all. I have to like go like this and then delete it. Okay. All right. All right. Here we
[14902.50s -> 14943.00s]  go. Another one, something else. Record doom off your phone. Doom OST. Just that first
[14943.08s -> 14957.69s]  song. Oh, that's not going to work because it has to be layered. That's not going to work.
[14957.69s -> 14964.52s]  It's not going to cut over the other music. Yeah. Sorry guys. I gave it a shot.
[14973.93s -> 15000.46s]  I'm going to do that one. Dark horizon. Pursuit. Action theme. The art. Try acid bass.
[15000.46s -> 15006.49s]  No, that's it. No, it's not that it's only going to play for like eight seconds. I'm going
[15006.49s -> 15013.35s]  to try the art of war. What did I do? But I didn't do the art of war last time. Did I?
[15013.35s -> 15030.44s]  I did the last stand. No, that was the last stand. Let's try it. Come on.
[15030.44s -> 15074.70s]  Good enough. Good enough to end it. Let's see what it sounds like. It's not very, it's not
[15074.70s -> 15159.35s]  good. Doesn't fit. It's like the end of a rocko's modern life episode. I think that stays.
[15159.35s -> 15168.22s]  There it is. It's done. It's done. There's only one thing that I need to do and that is
[15168.22s -> 15182.02s]  I need to scan the people when they come in. That needs to stay constant. Fix the heaven
[15182.02s -> 15224.26s]  music. What's wrong with it? Oh, I think this just hold on a minute here. I think the
[15224.26s -> 15264.31s]  Armageddon is just going to play. You know what? I think it's good. I think it's good.
[15264.31s -> 15298.70s]  I'm done fiddling. I'm done fiddling. I'm done fiddling. It's done. It's done. It's done.
[15298.70s -> 15314.92s]  Save it. Yes. Yes. We got it. No crashes. No bullshit. So here's what I'm going to do.
[15314.92s -> 15321.88s]  I am going to go pee while it all exports because we don't want to watch it like two,
[15321.88s -> 15326.84s]  three, four, five times in a row. Export it and then we'll watch it in all of its glory
[15326.84s -> 15333.24s]  when I come back. Custom scanning. Thank you very much. I would have just forgot that.
[15333.24s -> 15339.90s]  Thank you for reminding me. Let's do that first. When do people come in? Right here.
[15339.90s -> 15348.79s]  But is that, oh, that messes up the music video. I don't want to do that one. It's
[15348.79s -> 15371.94s]  supposed to be silent here. Here is where it can pick up. Did anybody come in? They do. No,
[15377.50s -> 15396.82s]  no, no. He needs one. No, he doesn't. No, I'm not going to George Lucas this. We're good.
[15396.82s -> 15403.06s]  All right. I'm going to export it. I will see you guys in a minute and we'll watch it.
[15403.06s -> 15524.44s]  See you soon. All right. I'm back. It's still exporting though. It's going to take like
[15524.44s -> 15531.35s]  another two, three minutes. Was there more community subs? We're not. Sign out. How
[15531.35s -> 15536.68s]  many community subs is this? Just 10 more and then 10 more before that like 10 minutes ago.
[15537.32s -> 15554.86s]  Holy shit. Thank you. Did I fix the audio levels? I brought them back up. They were back. They were
[15554.86s -> 15568.12s]  at like what? Like 40%, 40% each essentially. You left in the fart. That's great. I did. Of
[15568.12s -> 15596.12s]  course I would have. Oh well. We win. Yeah. The fart has a deeper meaning you plebs. And
[15596.12s -> 15599.00s]  then we'll see how much this movie makes. This was like four and a half hours for this.
[15599.94s -> 15614.55s]  A little bit less from setting up. Dude, I want this ant falling into the dumpster to be
[15617.24s -> 15623.06s]  like my phone background. I want to unlock my phone and see that every day.
[15633.54s -> 15637.30s]  I just saw it. I just saw it. You know it's worth seeing again. It's worth seeing like
[15637.30s -> 15654.18s]  five more times. All right. It's almost ready. Another like minute almost. Put the ant in your
[15654.18s -> 15662.52s]  Twitch description. Yeah. We could do an ant heaven sequel. It's possible. All right.
[15665.35s -> 15680.09s]  Movie is exporting. You have to play it through one whole time before you export it. But the
[15680.09s -> 15687.42s]  export takes a lot less time because it already played it through. It's finally finished.
[15689.69s -> 15695.13s]  Now the audio might not be perfect because when you export these it does a lot of
[15696.74s -> 15701.06s]  sometimes it moves stuff around. Sometimes it lags in the middle and moves a clip a little
[15701.06s -> 15705.30s]  bit forward. So it might not be perfect the way we've been seeing it in the actual editor.
[15706.46s -> 15710.38s]  But we'll see. It might actually play pretty well in like that viewing screen. We'll see.
[15724.26s -> 15737.38s]  Is this stream for kids? No. I would say no. I don't think so. I'm about to see it in fast
[15737.38s -> 15746.01s]  motion. It was perfect. It was awesome in fast motion too. All right. Let me just make
[15746.01s -> 15752.82s]  sure it's there. Let me make sure it actually exists in that folder before I close this window
[15752.82s -> 15763.03s]  and then we can watch it in the inside of here. Does it exist? But for this I have to
[15763.03s -> 15773.26s]  alt tab. So cross your fingers. I have to go into the movies folder. It's all in the
[15773.26s -> 15782.82s]  culmination to right now. Okay. Movies. I see food shop burgers available. I think that's the
[15782.82s -> 15788.38s]  one. I'm going to copy that. I'm being so careful. I'm going to paste that onto my
[15788.38s -> 15793.82s]  desktop and I'm just going to double click it just to see what it does. I think we're good.
[15793.82s -> 15808.07s]  And it was very loud. Yep. I got it. It worked. So let's release the movie and watch the movie
[15808.07s -> 15829.98s]  and see what it was worth. All right. That should be it. It's saved. It is ready. Exit.
[15832.87s -> 15840.87s]  Release the movie. Okay. A new competition. I'll award three healing crystals to anyone who can
[15840.87s -> 15848.71s]  tell me three colors of my aura today. It's not difficult. Down here. Where do I release the
[15848.71s -> 15868.54s]  movie? Lead role. Where is it? Canon. PR. Where the hell is the release the movie thing?
[15871.75s -> 15879.48s]  Because that's PR and then this is post production. Just do make a bunch of
[15879.48s -> 15881.80s]  ads for it. Okay. I'm going to spend like a hundred million dollars on it.
[15881.88s -> 15909.27s]  Okay. It's stuck in development. Hell. What? What is this snort? I didn't snort. Oh,
[15909.27s -> 15915.14s]  oh, I thought you talked about when I went like, Oh, right. Yeah.
[15922.34s -> 15936.33s]  All right. Movie's ready for release. All right. It's been, I don't want to do
[15936.33s -> 15951.42s]  any more post production on it. Where's this damn building? Shoot it. Okay. There we go.
[15951.42s -> 15954.54s]  Fine. Release. Budget. It's going to be as much as I can.
[15957.02s -> 15957.50s]  Here we go.
[15959.99s -> 15966.47s]  Crisp quality. Two out of five. This is loud as hell. This is so loud, but it's all right.
[15966.47s -> 15973.46s]  Just turn down a little. Repair of sets was superb. Average crew experience awful.
[15973.46s -> 15980.42s]  Final movie rating was two out of five stars. And are you ready to watch it?
[15981.14s -> 15987.59s]  The movie sucks, but it doesn't, the critics are always just mean.
[15988.74s -> 15991.78s]  All right. Turn down a little because it's going to be loud because I had to turn it up.
[15992.34s -> 15995.98s]  Are you ready? Let's go.
[16226.49s -> 16267.94s]  What did the critics say? Oh my God. One more. One more. Last one more. All right. One more.
[16267.94s -> 16272.02s]  One more. And that's it. This time I'm going to be silent for this one. I'm going to just mute.
[16275.16s -> 16287.43s]  If that ant seriously into the dumpster is, I love it so much. All right. First of all,
[16287.43s -> 16292.82s]  Phylactery Lich gave another $50. And they said I'm back. That was hilarious. I'm glad
[16292.82s -> 16299.42s]  you think so. This game's a lot of fun. All right. I'm going to mute. Here it comes. Encore.
[16299.42s -> 16301.82s]  Last one. Here we go.
[16460.70s -> 16557.34s]  There it is. All right. You've got a silent clip of it. Ant Encore. Yeah, that was a fire ant.
[16559.50s -> 16571.29s]  All right. Let's see. Success. Stunt rating. Difficulty. They were no success. Scene 26.
[16572.01s -> 16578.55s]  That's because they were doing their own stunts. Some of the extras did stunts better than the
[16578.55s -> 16594.97s]  actors. Uh, it was $266,000? Or is that $266? No, it can't be, right? This wasn't $2.84.
[16600.78s -> 16616.92s]  This was $266. Strange. Pee Pants Liquidated certainly shows some ability here and should
[16616.92s -> 16622.97s]  consider producing a third comedy flick. Jax really let this movie down. The crew
[16622.97s -> 16627.61s]  what a bunch of incompetent inexperienced cretins. Jax's stinking mood could well have
[16627.61s -> 16635.85s]  affected his performance here. Movie packed with originality. The acting was decidedly average.
[16636.65s -> 16642.86s]  The set scenes in this movie were clearly in superb condition. Why did I make it a comedy?
[16644.15s -> 16658.02s]  Because four hours ago, this was a different movie. Oh, there it is.
[16658.26s -> 16672.18s]  The president says he will not lose. Currently, the sand is making no comment.
[16672.90s -> 16678.74s]  I'm going to very quickly. I'm going to turn it down because it is loud. It's very loud.
[16679.94s -> 16686.58s]  And guys, I'm sorry to say that is going to conclude the stream because
[16687.54s -> 16698.09s]  I have to get on an airplane. I wanted to go for a good five hours before
[16699.05s -> 16707.26s]  leaving. I am going to be gone for a week. I've got a lot of work to do to work on this
[16707.26s -> 16714.07s]  Doug Tank carnival stream. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then just stay tuned.
[16716.38s -> 16719.34s]  I'm going to visit family and I'm going to do a bunch of work on this stream.
[16722.57s -> 16739.93s]  So I will see you guys in a week. Going back to Boston. Yep. Because on top of just seeing
[16739.93s -> 16746.41s]  family, I saw my mother, as you all know, a couple months ago. But some of my immediate
[16746.41s -> 16753.85s]  and extended family are coming in and some of my siblings are moving across the country,
[16753.85s -> 16760.09s]  kind of like I did. And this is the last time that we'll probably all see each other.
[16760.89s -> 16767.69s]  In a very, very, very long time. So I feel like I kind of took the opportunity to come back
[16768.41s -> 16779.82s]  because I obviously want to see some of these people for the last time in a while. So I will
[16779.82s -> 16789.42s]  see you all next week. Keep your eye on the sus. Don't do anything crazy without me. Behave.
[16791.98s -> 16795.74s]  I'm just gonna stick around for the 20 minutes and so we'll do the bits and the subs and
[16795.74s -> 16803.26s]  everything. Hope you enjoyed. The movies is always a ton of fun. I still have a bunch of
[16804.50s -> 16808.74s]  other characters and other things we could do. If you'd like to see it again,
[16809.38s -> 16823.99s]  we'll probably do it again because it is too much fun to play this. Anywho, I'm going to
[16823.99s -> 16832.07s]  turn this off. I'm going to transition to the outro. Take care, guys. I think
[16832.07s -> 16837.51s]  you're just taking off. Hopefully we see you again soon. See you next week. Those of you
[16837.51s -> 16847.91s]  sticking around, we've got some bits to do. Why don't we do them right now? Let's go back.
[16847.91s -> 16856.14s]  There was a lot of money today. A lot of high denomination bit donations and subs.
[16858.31s -> 16869.11s]  You guys are very, very, very kind to me. Thank you. Let's go back to earlier this afternoon.
[16870.07s -> 16877.21s]  7layerwario gave $10. Hey, my partner Wes has been a big fan of yours for a while.
[16877.21s -> 16883.40s]  Could you say hello? Thanks for everything. Hello, Wes. Hope you're having a good day, Wes.
[16883.96s -> 16895.05s]  How the heck are you? And then I put my hand out. Here we go. Hey, what's up, man?
[16895.69s -> 16908.42s]  Hey, what's up? But thank you for the $10. I really appreciate it. We also had
[16909.40s -> 16926.02s]  a ton of community subs. Herbert1234 gave $20. Deddo, Deddo, Deddo. $20. We had $50 from
[16926.02s -> 16936.33s]  Bakken. $50 from Phylactery. $450 total from Phylactery. Very, very generous. Thank you,
[16936.33s -> 16946.97s]  guys. We also had more community subs from campfkaren for $5. Waity, thanks for the $5.
[16946.97s -> 16955.58s]  Buxwaity or Waty, when is there going to be an auto stream? I don't think I'll ever have like
[16955.58s -> 16965.08s]  a just a purely auto stream. He shows up from time to time on camera. He'll poke his head in
[16965.08s -> 16975.14s]  every now and again. But thank you for the $5. Jerma lied and didn't draw sticks.
[16976.04s -> 16983.19s]  Thanks for the $2.50. Speaking of Burger King, play those three Burger King games
[16983.19s -> 16989.19s]  that are on the Xbox. Sneak King, Big Bumpin' and Pocket Bike. They were surprisingly fun.
[16992.06s -> 16998.46s]  Well, we didn't, there was no talk of Burger King today, but I mean, if we were to talk
[16998.46s -> 17006.81s]  about Burger King at some point, then yeah, I mean, maybe I would try them. I do remember
[17006.81s -> 17015.72s]  those games, though, especially Sneak King. Thank you, though. Thank you, Saturnian Ocean
[17016.28s -> 17021.99s]  for the $15. Last week, I got my wisdom teeth removed. They finished in about 30 minutes,
[17021.99s -> 17026.07s]  which was pretty cool. Too bad I woke up in the middle of them ripping out a tooth.
[17026.71s -> 17029.75s]  It wasn't great. Anyway, keep up the good work, Jerma Saturn.
[17030.71s -> 17041.56s]  Uh, yeah, that does not sound very fun. Did your face swell up? Did you look like a chipmunk?
[17043.13s -> 17048.81s]  That happened to me. It looked like I had, um, you know when a hamster stuffs like
[17048.81s -> 17057.37s]  seeds in his mouth. It's crazy how that works. You just have this inflated face.
[17059.37s -> 17066.06s]  How does the human body repair itself like that? That insane, intense amount of trauma
[17066.06s -> 17074.66s]  that we can have on our bodies and then be fine in less than a couple weeks. It's crazy.
[17081.24s -> 17085.48s]  The mouth is literally the fastest healing part of the body. It just seems so strange.
[17088.20s -> 17095.67s]  Human beings, man. Imagine living without any healing. Yeah, imagine if we just didn't
[17095.67s -> 17100.60s]  self-repair ourselves. If you got a cut on your finger and it's there for life,
[17100.60s -> 17110.74s]  what do you do? It's just wild. Well, you, you'd probably, yeah, we'd probably just die.
[17116.04s -> 17121.27s]  Well, that's not good. But anyways, now hopefully the procedure went well.
[17122.17s -> 17128.66s]  Thank you for the $15, uh, Saturnian. It was last week, but hopefully you're still in a
[17128.66s -> 17137.67s]  decent recovery here. Thank you for the $15. Gordon Burbman. Thank you, Gordon Burbman,
[17137.67s -> 17143.82s]  for the 20 bucks. $20. They say, hey, Jerma, I finally managed to catch you streaming.
[17143.82s -> 17147.90s]  Pretty hard to do over here in Europe. I've been watching your content for at least five
[17147.90s -> 17151.98s]  years. I just want to say thanks for all the laughs. Too many times I've been this close
[17151.98s -> 17159.75s]  to burger boy throwing up from the laughter. Here's to more years to come. Well, welcome
[17159.75s -> 17168.87s]  from the EU. I've had a couple of EU friendly streams this last two weeks, haven't I? I've
[17168.87s -> 17176.95s]  been getting up early is what's been happening. But yeah, um, five years is a long time. I've been
[17176.95s -> 17185.22s]  doing this for eight. Once it gets to 10, that's a, I mean, that's less than two years. Think
[17185.22s -> 17193.56s]  about that. A full 10 years of doing stuff on the internet. You don't have to have like a
[17193.56s -> 17208.92s]  party. Here comes the 10th sneeze. But thank you Gordon Burbman. Uh, I also from these
[17208.92s -> 17213.53s]  streams have almost burger boy thrown up because some of these games are just so funny.
[17213.53s -> 17217.37s]  They're just so odd and so interesting. So I think you can't help yourself sometimes.
[17219.72s -> 17227.21s]  Uh, Siroc, Sirockey Q. Thanks for the $12 and 50 cents. E-clown streamer Jerma is being
[17227.21s -> 17232.81s]  sued for defamation by Burger King. Jerma is also suspect of kidnapping, murdering,
[17232.81s -> 17236.65s]  money laundering, a clown car without a license, grand theft, ballooning,
[17236.65s -> 17241.05s]  cannibalism, uh, slavery, video game, privacy, tax evasion. I'm not accused of any
[17241.05s -> 17244.97s]  of those things. I don't know where you're getting the word burger and then the other
[17244.97s -> 17255.53s]  word that is also King. I don't know where you're getting those from. Those are two words
[17256.17s -> 17261.13s]  that back to back could mean something, but I did not make any references to those two words
[17261.13s -> 17266.01s]  that are connected together to form a potential corporate entity. I'd never talked about it.
[17267.96s -> 17274.42s]  On this stream today, we had old man with crown who was Zeus. That was Zeus.
[17275.53s -> 17280.01s]  I, and people in the chat were saying, is what is this supposed to be? Is this something about
[17280.01s -> 17283.21s]  the King? And I'm like, no, no, no, no, this is, this is old man with crown Zeus.
[17285.02s -> 17291.22s]  I corrected everybody in the chat at least a few times, but thank you for the 250.
[17291.78s -> 17296.86s]  Hey, Reapers Reviews. Thanks for $15, Reapers. Hey, Jerma, just want to say I love your
[17296.86s -> 17301.34s]  content and was introduced to you through a friend. Keep doing you also. When is your
[17301.34s -> 17309.16s]  memoir coming out? It already did come up. It was like the children's snake book thing.
[17309.80s -> 17318.38s]  I would just put my name on that and say this is the memoir. Otherwise,
[17319.10s -> 17332.84s]  that was such a fucked up stream. It's over. Did he ever revisit the E3 movie? I did. In fact,
[17332.84s -> 17336.36s]  at the very beginning of the stream, if you watch the VOD, if you open up that VOD,
[17336.92s -> 17344.17s]  the first thing we do is we watch the edited E3 presentation. I did that earlier. It was done
[17344.17s -> 17348.33s]  before the stream started. I hope you enjoy it because it is an absolute shit show,
[17349.05s -> 17355.77s]  but thank you. Reapers Reviews and thanks to your friend for introducing you to me.
[17358.52s -> 17365.83s]  Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $5. $5 from Freudian. Hey, Jerma, just wanted to wish you
[17365.83s -> 17369.59s]  well on your break. Hope the behind the scenes work on the dunk tank proves fruitful.
[17369.59s -> 17375.08s]  Have a good weekend, Jerma Hart. I'm gonna do my best. I'm gonna do my absolute best.
[17379.24s -> 17388.22s]  Hopefully it's worth it. It should be at least interesting. It's worth a try. Back in,
[17388.22s -> 17397.00s]  I missed this earlier, but Back in gave $100 and $50. So sorry I missed this earlier. I was
[17397.00s -> 17400.12s]  probably locked in doing something, but $100 from Back in. Thank you so much.
[17401.00s -> 17405.30s]  Been watching you for so long since early YouTube. My perception of time is degrading
[17405.30s -> 17409.06s]  more and more I feel, but I will never forget the amount of time you brought
[17409.06s -> 17414.02s]  joy to my life throughout the years. Keep doing you, Boomer, Jerma Hart. PS,
[17414.02s -> 17421.54s]  this Burger King conflict movie is too violent. It's not, it's not those things.
[17421.54s -> 17428.01s]  It is a restaurant. It was first of all, it's a pizzeria. I don't know any two words connected
[17428.01s -> 17432.25s]  to make a corporate entity with a medieval king involved. I don't know of any pizzeria
[17432.25s -> 17440.02s]  that has that on there named. So I first, that's the number one, but it wasn't,
[17440.02s -> 17449.46s]  that wasn't even that violent. It was just, I mean, it kind of was, but that's a lot of
[17449.46s -> 17455.38s]  money. $150 in one stream is a lot of money to give anybody. So thank you back in.
[17456.10s -> 17469.30s]  Hope you enjoy yourself. Hey, Freudian already got you, but $5. Thank you again.
[17470.10s -> 17483.96s]  We also had, it was a lot of community subs. My stream labs is just a fucking,
[17483.96s -> 17489.96s]  just huge, huge amount of them. You guys are fucking awesome. Thank you.
[17490.84s -> 17496.50s]  You guys are too much. Uh, smelly boy. Thanks for the 250. Please make a scrambled egg
[17496.50s -> 17505.54s]  breakfast on stream. I'll probably do a cooking stream eventually here. I got to be careful
[17505.54s -> 17510.26s]  though, cause I want to do some dumb joke and like, I'll like light the pot pan on fire or
[17510.26s -> 17524.58s]  something. It would be bad. It's like the one thing holding me back, but Keldo's thanks
[17524.58s -> 17529.34s]  for the $3. Uh, since you've listened to Red Vox, what songs are your favorite? Also,
[17529.34s -> 17537.85s]  what do you think about Jerma Fox? Uh, let me see Jerma Fox. Jerma Fox is from,
[17537.85s -> 17549.32s]  is Jerma Chomp, but a Fox. I think it's pretty cool. I think it's pretty awesome actually.
[17549.96s -> 17557.24s]  It's cute. It's cute. It's cute. What's cute. I see people writing in the chat. Why, uh,
[17558.04s -> 17564.04s]  me burning my house down would be, is like LOL quotes funny. I actually had a stream idea
[17564.04s -> 17570.01s]  where I was doing a cooking show and why would I even tell you this? Cause it could still
[17570.01s -> 17577.11s]  happen eventually. There's like a whole elaborate thing here. I don't like burn anything down,
[17577.91s -> 17588.86s]  but there was an elaborate scheme I was going to do. No, no, no, no, not scheme. That's the
[17588.86s -> 17597.03s]  wrong word. But anyways, Vinny is a very talented musician. He takes his music very
[17597.03s -> 17627.40s]  seriously and shows. Let me just show you. Blood bagels was blood bagel. Give Fox, give Fox,
[17627.40s -> 17650.18s]  give Fox. I'm not going to give Fox. Why did I say give Fox three times? Cause everyone's
[17650.18s -> 17696.30s]  screaming it. It's a good shit, ain't it? It's very good. Go get it, go listen to it,
[17696.30s -> 17709.72s]  go support it. I'm going to get content claimed by Vinny. What if he just like
[17709.72s -> 17715.11s]  dropped the fucking hammer on me and like ruined me and like took me to court and like took
[17715.11s -> 17730.66s]  every, everything. And I mean everything. I'm like, I ended up like the no house, no nothing.
[17730.66s -> 17732.82s]  And he's just, and he's just like laughing on stream afterwards,
[17742.12s -> 17751.91s]  but thank you. Kaldos for the $3. And that's probably the, this is probably two more songs
[17751.91s -> 17765.59s]  that I think are really good on that album, but are in that catalog, but thank you for
[17765.59s -> 17778.73s]  $3. Vinny's a good dude. You hate the rest of the album. No, I'm going to make sure this is like,
[17778.73s -> 17793.98s]  you can't like clip me out of context there. Like I know it's going to be like,
[17793.98s -> 17799.50s]  here's a few of eight seconds of a sentence you said. Let's get that last four seconds
[17799.50s -> 17803.18s]  and then get cut it right. Perfect. Fade it in a little. So it sounds more natural. Add
[17803.18s -> 17808.06s]  some more background music to background sounds and then fade the end out and then,
[17808.06s -> 17811.02s]  you know, change it a little. You guys, I know how talented some of you guys can be.
[17812.79s -> 17824.89s]  I'm not an idiot. What's this? What's this one? What happened? What's this? Oh, fuck. Oh,
[17824.89s -> 17830.57s]  what happened? What happened? Hey, RoboLamp, thanks for the 10 bucks. Germa Heart. Hey,
[17830.57s -> 17837.51s]  thank you. Germa Heart back to you as well. Thanks for the $10. We have a official Burger
[17837.51s -> 17843.24s]  King, $2.50. This is not a real account. I want to make sure that this is very clear.
[17844.68s -> 17853.77s]  This is not real. Okay, thank you, official Zeus Old Man Crown for the $2.50.
[17854.49s -> 17858.01s]  Good day, Mr. Albertson. We have received reports that you have been using the likeness

[17885.29s -> 17890.57s]  person that's a medieval crown has on their head in a pizza restaurant. Thank you.
[17893.19s -> 17900.30s]  I appreciate it. Thanks for the $2.50. Thank you C4G for the $2.50. Is this you? Is this you?
[17902.94s -> 17915.80s]  Um, no, no, it's not me. But thank you for the $2.50. Appreciate it. Cyanide gave so many subs.
[17915.80s -> 17923.62s]  How many subs did Cyanide Zero give today? It has to be more than 50 to 100. It has to be.
[17930.58s -> 17941.70s]  That's a lot. Thank you Cyanide. If you're still here. Oh, we also had a 0.9 for the $5.
[17943.67s -> 17946.95s]  Stop listening to the one guy in chat. This is pure gold.
[17949.46s -> 17953.78s]  No, I thought I was removing things and changing and checking that. Guys,
[17953.78s -> 17959.88s]  that's how I used to make videos. I would sit there meticulously for 10 straight hours
[17961.11s -> 17965.91s]  on the same thing. No, no, no, no, no. I don't like that. I gotta move that forward a little.
[17965.91s -> 17969.35s]  Look at this. No, I don't like it. Change discolete that whole to get rid of the whole
[17969.35s -> 17979.18s]  clip. I hate it. I used to do that all the time. I would just George Lucas the same video
[17979.18s -> 17995.43s]  like 10 times. Imagine editing. I know, really, right? But thank you, 0.9. Jack Raff, thanks for
[17995.43s -> 17998.55s]  the $2.50. Do you ever think you'll be able to play The Neverhood on stream? Any other games
[17998.55s -> 18004.07s]  you grew up with that you'd like to revisit? Maybe. The Neverhood's kind of odd though,
[18004.07s -> 18008.07s]  because from every time I've ever gone back and played it, because there's never been a
[18008.07s -> 18014.55s]  remaster. There's never been an updated version of that game. It's just the brick
[18014.55s -> 18021.98s]  Windows 95 version that I've tried to run on various machines over the years. And sometimes
[18021.98s -> 18025.18s]  you can get it to work for a little while. But there's a very specific point in that game
[18025.18s -> 18030.94s]  that's about 50 to 60% of the way through the game that you cannot physically get through.
[18030.94s -> 18035.98s]  You have to like go download a save file that goes past this one point to be able to continue
[18035.98s -> 18055.94s]  to play it. Or run it in a Windows 95 virtual machine. And another reason why, I've played
[18055.94s -> 18065.45s]  through that game more than 10 to 20 times. So I would really just, it's the same reason why
[18065.45s -> 18069.05s]  I haven't really played Bloodborne or anything, because it's just like, hey, remember this part?
[18069.05s -> 18071.45s]  Hey, remember this part? Hey, do you remember this part? I remember this part. You're gonna
[18071.45s -> 18076.10s]  like this part. Hey, I remember this part. But there's something to be said to have like a fun
[18076.10s -> 18085.77s]  nostalgic stream like that. I'm not sure I would do something like Bloodborne though,
[18085.77s -> 18098.90s]  because that would take a long time. I'm open to it though. Kalula Sniper, thanks for the
[18098.90s -> 18105.05s]  five dollars, Kalula Sniper. Hey, Jeremy, I just got my two-year sub badge. Thank you for that.
[18105.61s -> 18109.61s]  The movie streams are the first I ever watched live, so it's great seeing you come back to
[18109.61s -> 18116.38s]  this game. Thanks for staying awesome all these years. Much love. I'm just glad that I could
[18116.38s -> 18119.66s]  still have fun with it. One of the reasons why I don't like revisiting old things that
[18119.66s -> 18124.86s]  I've done or doing the same thing more than a few times is because I feel like the magic won't be
[18124.86s -> 18134.55s]  there. After I stream a certain stream or stream a certain thing three, four plus times, it's
[18134.55s -> 18138.47s]  almost like going back to it is like, hey, let me like go make that magic happen again.
[18142.97s -> 18149.48s]  So it's not necessarily that I don't want to. It's just it has to be organic. It has to
[18149.48s -> 18155.90s]  be something that I feel like doing and know that I want to go back to. The same kind of
[18155.90s -> 18160.87s]  thing happened with Sims 4, but enough time went by where that second time that I did it was
[18161.43s -> 18165.66s]  just as fun as the first time. But I wouldn't want to be one of those people that,
[18166.66s -> 18173.24s]  hey, how much fun have I had on these movie streams? All right, I'm going to do this like
[18173.24s -> 18178.28s]  I'm going to do this for the next like two months. I would never do it. I would just
[18178.28s -> 18192.70s]  lose it. Magic would be gone. So I guess that's that's the answer, right? The answer to
[18192.70s -> 18197.74s]  the question that you did not even ask that I you made a comment and then I asked a question.
[18199.13s -> 18202.25s]  But thank you. I do like going back to things if it's worth going back to.
[18205.53s -> 18210.89s]  Hey, pigeon. Thanks for the 250 pigeon. Hey, I don't know if anyone's asked this you
[18210.89s -> 18214.73s]  they asked you this yet. But are you coming to TwitchCon in San Diego?
[18214.73s -> 18217.69s]  You've always been my idol and I'd love to be able to meet you.
[18221.75s -> 18232.94s]  Um, let me think. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. But I don't like here's the thing about
[18232.94s -> 18239.16s]  TwitchCon. I kind of just like float around at TwitchCon. I don't do like any official
[18239.16s -> 18246.18s]  meeting greets or anything. You kind of have to like find me. I've done I tweet like kind of
[18246.18s -> 18250.81s]  like, hey, I'm in front of the convention center for a half an hour. So I don't really
[18251.53s -> 18256.81s]  do any of the big panels or anything. I'm not going to do. I've wanted to do like a panel
[18256.81s -> 18260.57s]  before maybe. But I don't know if they'd want me to do it because that would kind of ruin
[18260.57s -> 18267.51s]  everything. I was thinking about doing a or seeing if they'd let me do a panel where
[18267.51s -> 18273.54s]  I just put up like slides of like a vacation or something. And like the name of the stream
[18273.54s -> 18278.90s]  is like how to make your brand how to make your brand easier to consume with viewers.
[18279.46s -> 18289.56s]  And I just talk about where I went on Disney. I don't even mention the word Twitch. I don't
[18289.56s -> 18296.84s]  mention like engagements. Nothing. I just show slides. But I feel like they would probably
[18296.84s -> 18304.50s]  be like, yeah, so you lied to us. And I'd be like, yeah, well, I'm a fucking liar.
[18304.50s -> 18309.30s]  Have you seen the haven't you seen 38% of every username in my channel?
[18309.30s -> 18324.84s]  You should have known this. But this this, I probably will. I don't let's put it this way.
[18324.84s -> 18331.58s]  I don't have a reason not to go. I'm not moving. Although I've talked about it. You
[18331.58s -> 18338.15s]  know, I was thinking about it. But I probably won't not moving not really spending a bunch of
[18338.39s -> 18347.14s]  that's not true. That is completely incorrect. You know, I'm not spending a bunch of money
[18347.14s -> 18352.90s]  or anything. I'm just like, actively setting up a fucking carnival stream, you know,
[18354.26s -> 18363.59s]  I'm not spending any money. But there's really no reason for me not to go.
[18364.15s -> 18377.19s]  I probably will. Moving to where I'd stay in Vegas, just if the internet was still an issue.
[18378.90s -> 18392.86s]  I would just go somewhere else. But yeah, it's not really on the cards at the moment.
[18392.86s -> 18399.80s]  I will be on the west coast probably for at least the next 10 years. I'll probably be in
[18399.80s -> 18406.73s]  Vegas for at least three to five, I would assume maybe potentially, I don't think I want to live
[18406.73s -> 18425.61s]  in California. I want to stay in this probably Southwest area for a while. Yeah, I'll be in
[18425.61s -> 18434.06s]  Vegas for a while. Why not California? California is expensive. It is very expensive, especially
[18434.06s -> 18440.38s]  a lot of the places that I would want to live. Hey, let's move to Los Angeles. Oh, move to
[18440.38s -> 18446.78s]  wait a minute. How many thousands of dollars a month is it to live in like a one or two bedroom
[18446.78s -> 18460.50s]  like apartment in LA? What's that again? How much was that? No, I like Las Vegas.
[18463.16s -> 18469.85s]  It speaks to me. It just does. But Sara Bellis, thanks for the $11 Sara Bellis. No
[18469.85s -> 18476.92s]  message, just $11. Thank you. Let's get the credits rolling here. And we'll see all those
[18476.92s -> 18489.14s]  community subs gambling. No, it's nothing to do with gambling. That's do it. I'm saying
[18489.78s -> 18494.57s]  there's nothing to do with gambling. It has to do with I'm tapping my foot to
[18495.21s -> 18507.35s]  nothing. That's not gambling. Decide I just give another $100.
[18507.83s -> 18520.86s]  Yeah, they did cyanide with another $100. Holy shit. Hey, Gerber, been a fan for a long
[18520.86s -> 18524.86s]  while haven't been able to give back for all the joy you brought to my life. I'm at a point
[18524.86s -> 18528.22s]  in my life where I can donate and contribute back to the community. I love you'll be missed
[18528.22s -> 18533.26s]  this week. Yes, I might change my name to Gerber lied about level up lounge. If you
[18533.26s -> 18543.19s]  don't actually do it. Let's let me do the carnival first. Okay. And let me see how much
[18543.19s -> 18548.31s]  money is in my like literal Monopoly man open them and have like the bugs come out
[18548.31s -> 18551.83s]  because there's nothing in there. Let me let me get this done first and we'll see.
[18552.63s -> 18561.29s]  He was so drunk. No, I really did want to do that. I thought it was really fun idea.
[18571.40s -> 18577.27s]  Drunk promises. No, they're not drunk promises. They were drunk thoughts.
[18580.74s -> 18592.73s]  They were drunk thoughts. But if you want to throw this kind of money down sign, I'm
[18592.73s -> 18598.71s]  glad to take it. I just hope you get you're comfortable doing it. And always know that
[18598.71s -> 18606.26s]  there is no real monetary obligation to hang out here and kind of care about this channel
[18606.26s -> 18612.20s]  and stuff. I just hope everybody knows that. But I really do. That's a lot of money. I
[18612.20s -> 18624.84s]  really appreciate it. I will try to put it to good use. Thank you. We also had Oh,
[18624.84s -> 18628.76s]  the credits, right? I want to get those rolling because they're going to fly by
[18631.50s -> 18641.96s]  lots of community subs tonight. Thank you. All of you. The LUL boys. We also had
[18642.76s -> 18659.83s]  and we had Espada Escarlata. $2.50. Thank you, Espada. Just want to show some more love. I'm
[18659.83s -> 18664.15s]  starting a job with the census in a month. It's been really rough trying to find work. And
[18664.15s -> 18668.07s]  like a lot of people say, your streams are a huge mood lift for me. Oh, and I hope you
[18668.07s -> 18672.87s]  have a good visit home. This year will hopefully be my last at home before I head out to Colorado.
[18673.59s -> 18685.37s]  Having moved back here and hating it. Colorado is a great state. A lot of interesting things
[18685.37s -> 18694.23s]  going on. Colorado was actually one of the states that I was thinking of moving to as
[18694.23s -> 18702.31s]  well. This little section of the US, this like Colorado, Nevada, even parts of Arizona
[18702.31s -> 18716.78s]  into like, I like, I like this area. Oregon has the coast though. Yeah, it's always Washington,
[18718.17s -> 18723.93s]  California. But if you don't really care about the water, if you don't really care about beaches
[18723.93s -> 18729.82s]  and, you know, big bodies of water and being on the ocean or whatever, which I don't really
[18729.82s -> 18736.07s]  doesn't bother me that much. That's why I can tolerate the landlocked kind of desert that
[18736.07s -> 18742.17s]  is Vegas because there is its own charm. Vegas has a lot of awesome mountains. They
[18742.17s -> 18749.34s]  have a lot of great, great wildlife preserves and everything. The Grand Canyon is really not
[18749.34s -> 18758.97s]  that far away from here. You really like to gloat about Vegas an awful lot. I love this place.
[18760.10s -> 18767.48s]  Vegas is awesome. I will talk the shit up of this place. I will talk up Vegas every day.
[18773.61s -> 18777.29s]  Australia is better than Vegas. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not.
[18777.29s -> 18798.22s]  That's what I'm saying. Do I have any complaints? Yeah. Yeah, there is like one
[18798.22s -> 18806.12s]  major complaint about Vegas. People around here is the only complaint I really have.
[18806.84s -> 18813.16s]  I love everything about Las Vegas and this portion of Nevada especially. But people
[18813.16s -> 18823.32s]  drive around here like fucking lunatics, fucking lunatics. And that's not just like a rumor meme.
[18824.44s -> 18833.06s]  Unfortunately, like sad and horribly enough, I've seen more horrendous car crashes
[18833.06s -> 18837.06s]  on the roads out here than ever, ever, ever before in any place I've ever been.
[18837.62s -> 18844.74s]  There is a terrible fucking car wreck on the street in Vegas once a week it seems. Like
[18844.74s -> 18849.06s]  we'll just be driving around and it's like, oh, there's another like car fucking wreck over
[18849.06s -> 18860.79s]  there. It's horrible. And Massachusetts, that was like maybe once every year, once a year,
[18861.43s -> 18869.40s]  once every maybe couple years driving around every day would you see a really bad pile up.
[18869.40s -> 18877.08s]  It's a bi-weekly experience out here. So just got to be careful on the roads then. That's
[18877.08s -> 18881.88s]  why the insurance insurance is high out here. Just because it's people up fucking drive around
[18881.96s -> 18890.30s]  like crazy people out here. That's the entire west coast in general. Maybe. This is my first
[18890.30s -> 18904.46s]  experience with it. Just don't leave your house. And you've been on the New York,
[18904.46s -> 18914.47s]  New York roller coaster. I have. It's pretty awesome actually. Yeah, but we've been very
[18914.47s -> 18922.09s]  careful when we drive around out here just because it's wild. But no, no, that's probably
[18922.09s -> 18928.26s]  it. That's the only real complaint that I've really had since being here. Thank you, Jamie.
[18928.82s -> 18934.98s]  KW for five dollars. They say Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100. Hi,
[18934.98s -> 18953.29s]  Jerma. Love you. Thank you so much. What kind of car do I drive? I drive a Hummer. It's the
[18953.29s -> 18962.76s]  double XL version. And I put like the seat up really high and I like fucking, I love just
[18962.76s -> 18979.32s]  being like big on the road. No, I don't drive a Hummer. Hummers are the types of cars that
[18979.32s -> 18986.28s]  you fill that gas tank. And if you drive to the grocery store, you use half a tank of gas.
[18986.92s -> 19004.84s]  You probably drive a 2010 Toyota. I do not. I do not. What a little mystery what my car is.
[19004.84s -> 19010.28s]  What kind of car do I drive? What a mystery this is for you guys. Maybe one day you find out
[19012.31s -> 19029.35s]  what do I drive for a car? It's not a Tesla. A clown car. I bet it's a Honda.
[19032.49s -> 19046.22s]  No, I'll tell you what I drive. I drive. Are you ready? I'll tell you the brand. I drive a
[19046.22s -> 19074.42s]  Toyota Prius. That is also not true. I do not drive a Prius. That's a 100% lie. I drive a
[19075.83s -> 19093.21s]  Honda Civic. It's also not true. I'm just doing this thing where I think somebody already
[19093.21s -> 19099.56s]  said it. Whatever car I say, people are just going to be laughing. It doesn't matter what it
[19099.56s -> 19108.98s]  is. It doesn't matter what car it is. Okay, guys, I drive. I drive. I'll be honest. I drive.
[19109.78s -> 19129.64s]  I drive a BMW 3 Series. By the way, one of those is true. You never know which one it is.
[19142.71s -> 19146.79s]  Hey, tell me. Tell me two truths and a lie. Give me. Tell me two truths and a lie.
[19146.79s -> 19153.06s]  Tell me three truths. No, tell me. No, I don't have two cards. Tell me three lies
[19153.62s -> 19159.24s]  and the truth. Or tell me four lies and none of them are true. Damn, would you guys like to find
[19159.24s -> 19169.54s]  out? Three truths. You got a huge garage with like four cars. None of that. That could all
[19169.54s -> 19175.05s]  be bullshit and you would never know. I just want to know the truth. Maybe one day I'll
[19175.05s -> 19185.06s]  reveal it. I'll do a car reveal one day. But we're at the end here. No, we're not. That's a
[19185.06s -> 19194.44s]  lie. Five truths and a lie. Five lies. Thank you, official crown on the head for the 250.
[19195.32s -> 19200.14s]  If you continue to say that this account is not official, we will add a count of first degree
[19200.14s -> 19205.26s]  slander in addition to copyright infringement. Although if you publicly state how delicious the
[19205.26s -> 19211.02s]  last sandwich was, you ate from one of our fine establishments, we may be able to drop
[19211.02s -> 19217.98s]  that charge. Well, I'll tell you, the last time I ate a sandwich from a restaurant that you may or
[19217.98s -> 19222.38s]  may not be referring to, I cannot confirm or deny what you're asking. It was very good.
[19223.88s -> 19244.18s]  It tasted very, very good. Tell us the sandwich. All right. Okay, fine. Okay, but what? It was
[19245.94s -> 19265.34s]  the Baconator. No, it wasn't. That's not it. It was the Stacker. No, wouldn't you? You would
[19265.34s -> 19275.26s]  like to know what it was, wouldn't you? What kind of sandwich that I drive? You'd really love to
[19275.26s -> 19291.29s]  have that information. Could be a, could be Big Mac. What kind of car he eats. Thank you,
[19291.29s -> 19296.01s]  though. Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer. 250 from Garfield. Buckle yourselves in,
[19296.01s -> 19300.41s]  boys and girls. It's time for the final Garfagraph. Final, wait, final Garfagraph.
[19301.05s -> 19311.19s]  What is this? This can't be real. It's been quite a journey, Germ, with me
[19312.41s -> 19319.13s]  talking about Odie and other cartoon happenings. You getting bricked, fumed as you read every single
[19319.13s -> 19326.09s]  one. Me only paying you 25 cents to read a wall of text. You laughing one out of 10 of them.
[19326.09s -> 19334.25s]  Good times, good memories. I think it's about time Garfield buries this hatchet once and for
[19334.25s -> 19338.73s]  all. Garf will be but a memory to the Germs. Thanks for all the laps, Germ, and never stop
[19338.73s -> 19349.22s]  killing those Mondays. But who will you become? But who will you become? We need to know the,
[19349.22s -> 19356.76s]  the, the, take the, the veil off. We need to know who the, the, the, who's behind the mask.
[19358.52s -> 19362.84s]  Garfield. 250 from Garfield. Here we go. Let's see who the, who's behind the mask.
[19363.48s -> 19368.90s]  Thank you for the $2.50. Again. Hold on. I'm not back. I just dropped my pen on the floor.
[19369.99s -> 19376.01s]  Ha, you know us cats. No pockets and all that. Okay, this is the final Garfagraph. At least
[19376.01s -> 19382.12s]  giving constant Garfagraphs. I might like pop in every year or so. I don't know. Don't stop
[19382.12s -> 19387.78s]  believing all you Germs in chat. I might even come back one day. Who knows? Does any other
[19387.78s -> 19393.40s]  cartoon Germabit donators make yourself known? Remember that Robot Jones guy? He gave like two
[19393.40s -> 19402.23s]  bits that one time. Don't forget to update the Germo Wiki. Constant Garfagraphs. Constant
[19402.23s -> 19410.74s]  conflict. Well, if this is for real, Garfield, you've been a, you've been a hell of a
[19410.74s -> 19417.70s]  contributor to the community. If you're retiring the name, hopefully, hopefully you're not
[19418.74s -> 19427.37s]  leaving the community. But if you, if you have some things going on that make it so you can't
[19427.37s -> 19432.38s]  participate as often in streams, then whatever it is, I wish you the best of luck. Thank you
[19432.38s -> 19450.25s]  so much for your awesome, awesome contributions. Hell yeah, Garfield. Thank you. Hope you're
[19450.25s -> 19459.37s]  still here under another username. Yeah. Definitely. And that's my time. Have a good
[19459.37s -> 19468.73s]  week everybody. I will update the SUS early. Probably. I don't know exactly when I will be
[19468.73s -> 19478.81s]  back in this chair. It's going to be at least a week. Six days probably. One, two, three,
[19478.81s -> 19483.45s]  four. Maybe less than that. It depends. Keep an eye on the SUS. You will see. You'll know.
[19484.66s -> 19498.46s]  Thank you for participating in the movies streams. Have Kim stream. Kim is coming with me.
[19499.10s -> 19507.77s]  We are both going back. Talix is going to hold the fort down here. He's going to take
[19507.77s -> 19520.34s]  care of Otto for us while we go back. But yeah, I'll see you soon. Don't forget about me,
[19520.34s -> 19528.90s]  because I won't forget about you. Good night, guys. See you real soon. Have a great week.
[19528.90s -> 19532.50s]  Tata.
