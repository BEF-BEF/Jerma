[0.70s -> 9.78s]  All right, that was fucking weird. So apparently, I don't know why this is,
[11.14s -> 20.22s]  but I guess most of Twitch's servers are down. So let me explain why this is possible. I usually
[20.22s -> 28.38s]  stream to a server in Arizona, right? So I picked the Arizona server. That's the one I usually
[29.10s -> 37.82s]  stream to because Italics and I run from the same box. We both decided we shouldn't probably run
[37.82s -> 44.06s]  to the same server. So I was just like scrolling through picking new servers.
[46.58s -> 50.66s]  Which one of these is going to work? And then you guys saying this stream was fine. So I'm like,
[51.54s -> 55.54s]  well, let's just go to the same one. So we're both going to the same server and there's no
[55.54s -> 60.02s]  problems at all. So I was freaking out. I thought there was a major problem with like my computer
[60.02s -> 68.57s]  or something. No, it's just all the Twitch servers are all fucked up. I guess that's just
[68.57s -> 79.51s]  what's going on. So welcome. Sorry for that. I wish I was live 15, 20 minutes ago. Anyways,
[79.51s -> 92.46s]  I need a coaster here. I feel like I should retweet again, but it's all right. Let's just
[92.46s -> 101.67s]  get started here. What is happening on stream today? Well, let me give me a second to explain it.
[103.19s -> 106.95s]  I just turned it on. I just was able to be live for a minute. Just making sure it's going to
[106.95s -> 117.69s]  work now. Now, now, now, now, now. All right. Everybody relax. I just, I just like dodged a
[117.69s -> 124.73s]  major like computer bullet. Okay. And this is what we got here. Okay. Hi, by the way,
[124.73s -> 129.61s]  I'm a little flustered. I'm a little like fucking angry. I've just, I can't help that.
[130.17s -> 135.88s]  I got to come down off of like being upset because I was really upset. I was just very,
[135.88s -> 146.09s]  very irritated, but not anymore. I think I'm just making sure this is good. Nice table. Well,
[146.09s -> 150.57s]  this is a fuck you table. You don't know what a fuck you table is. It's a table that you
[150.57s -> 156.49s]  just do whatever you want on it. You don't really care. You paint on it. You play card
[156.49s -> 160.89s]  games on it. You like pick it up over your head and throw it down a flight of stairs.
[160.89s -> 167.13s]  Just because you felt like it. I got here three decks. This is the thing I was talking
[167.13s -> 171.77s]  about like last week. Probably like, why do you get a fucking iPad here? First of all,
[171.77s -> 175.69s]  I know people are going to talk about it, so let's just show it. Yes, this is broken.
[177.46s -> 181.54s]  I don't know if you can see this. All down there is a big crack down the middle.
[182.66s -> 191.10s]  I stepped on this out of bed one day and now there's a big giant lice down the middle
[191.10s -> 196.92s]  and it's cracked and the volume doesn't work anymore. I was lying in bed sleeping sometimes,
[196.92s -> 203.48s]  but I don't know why I do this. I'm just a fucking idiot. I have an end table to my left,
[204.28s -> 211.80s]  so instead of just putting it on the end table when I'm tired, I'm falling asleep and just go
[214.73s -> 220.34s]  hang it over the edge and let go. I don't know why. I'm just fucking crazy. I just get
[220.34s -> 225.38s]  so tired that I just like hang it over the edge and just and then fall asleep.
[226.34s -> 230.34s]  I forgot that I did that and I got out of bed one day and I just put the heel down
[230.34s -> 236.58s]  right in the middle and then stepped again. No, no, no, no. I'm not ready yet. I'm not
[236.58s -> 244.36s]  ready yet. Don't press this button. I've got to be so fucking mad right now. I was about
[244.36s -> 249.72s]  to elbow through the screen. I was going to WWE off the top rope through the middle of
[249.72s -> 256.04s]  ice cream. I was so fucking angry. I got to like, how do I, how do you, give me like an
[256.04s -> 261.78s]  exercise. Can I do something? How do I like make this right? How do I like change this attitude?
[262.34s -> 278.23s]  I've got such a fucking bad attitude right now. Give me a minute. I have such a bad attitude
[278.23s -> 285.10s]  right now. I can hear it. I sound different. I sound like an attitude boy. It's not like
[285.10s -> 292.79s]  let it go over the bed. Like whatever. I can feel it. But should I tweet again?
[295.18s -> 302.15s]  Everybody like, are we good? Or should I like tweet again? No, I think I'm all right. Anywho,
[302.95s -> 307.99s]  I don't know which one of these I want to play. This game is this like 20 of them,
[307.99s -> 314.31s]  right? So I got these three. I don't, maybe you guys could pick which one we want to do.
[314.31s -> 319.43s]  I don't, I don't know. I was going to just like randomize and like let my finger
[320.23s -> 327.83s]  stop on one of them. We've got the clown world, like clown in the town. We've got wild west world.
[328.79s -> 333.61s]  We've got dinosaur world. So I don't know which one of these three we want to do.
[337.59s -> 343.35s]  Let us click. Well, I think people want to do clown from my, from what it was before,
[343.35s -> 349.10s]  my understanding. Squeak and sausage. Now I have no idea how this is played. This might
[349.10s -> 353.98s]  be the worst spring you've ever been to, or it might be the best spring you've ever been to.
[353.98s -> 356.86s]  It's one of those like flip the coin. Which one of these is it going to be?
[359.03s -> 363.19s]  But each one of these has a deck, which I very specifically was yelled at
[363.91s -> 369.37s]  because look at this, ready? You open the box. Look at, oh, this is cool. Unlock. Important.
[370.01s -> 374.65s]  Do not look through the card decks. It's like, don't fucking touch this.
[374.65s -> 377.61s]  So I'm like, okay. So I haven't even opened them. They're just here.
[378.17s -> 383.16s]  It says, don't just don't touch it. So I just, so people look, I want people to know that I
[383.16s -> 388.86s]  didn't fuck with this. Sealed. Inside of the shrink. I haven't done anything to that. I want
[388.86s -> 393.26s]  to make sure you understand that. I'm not, I'm not trying to cheat here. The goal of these
[393.26s -> 402.55s]  decks is it is an escape game, which pairs itself with this. You pick one from here and
[402.55s -> 406.39s]  then you've got to escape the game. I don't know how the fuck. Yeah, I've got my
[406.39s -> 411.99s]  fingerprints on it now. All right. So you understand how it works. Well, I mean as much
[411.99s -> 416.94s]  as I do and I don't really just fingerprints all over this. Yeah. I mean, yeah. You want
[416.94s -> 420.46s]  to like dust this. You're going to find all kinds of fucking like fingerprints on this.
[420.46s -> 425.21s]  You'll find footprints on this too. You'll find nose prints. Okay. You know what a
[425.21s -> 429.45s]  dog when there's a sliding door at somebody's house and at the bottom of the glass with a
[429.45s -> 434.25s]  sliding door is there's like dog nose prints, like literally all over it. Like that's,
[434.25s -> 438.09s]  that's definitely on here. Like I've gotten close before and like my nose is streaked down
[438.09s -> 442.49s]  the middle. So this is my nose prints on here. All right. I think it was, let's just do the clown
[442.49s -> 450.06s]  one. That one sounds like the most fun. I think that's the one I want to do. And look,
[450.06s -> 454.30s]  these are supposed to take, you have your timed to do these. You have 60 minutes to
[454.30s -> 467.88s]  complete them. And I'm going to try just to do one. So how do I, let's see. Unlock ages
[467.96s -> 478.36s]  10 and up, 60 minutes, one to six players. So if they, if I had six, okay. I might go over a
[478.36s -> 484.12s]  little bit of time here because if it's 60 minutes and you can have six people working
[484.12s -> 488.47s]  together, I mean, I'm going to take the whole 60 minutes, right? It's going to take me like
[488.47s -> 494.28s]  a long time. All right. Hold on. Important. Do not look through the card decks before
[494.28s -> 501.72s]  starting to play. There's a 10 card tutorial deck and then a 60 card deck. Each deck is
[501.72s -> 507.48s]  a full independent scenario. Enter an immersive adventure and work together to complete your
[507.48s -> 516.79s]  mission. You have one hour in real time to overcome the many challenges. I got to go
[516.79s -> 553.22s]  like smell like a rose. I'm going to go get a flower. I'll be right back now. I was
[553.22s -> 556.98s]  about to leave. Nevermind. I'm not, I'm still here. No, get this off. I just,
[557.70s -> 562.42s]  God, I got to get this out of me. I'm going to scream. Okay. I think that'll work.
[565.18s -> 585.75s]  I need to like scream. Like I, I'm going to scream. I feel a little bit better. All
[585.75s -> 593.45s]  right. I think I'm good. Did that work? This is like a devil just sitting right here.
[593.45s -> 598.01s]  There's no angel here. There's two devils and they're both just like fucking throwing
[598.01s -> 605.06s]  darts into my neck. Just like, could you really go get like a drink? But it's like,
[605.06s -> 609.06s]  it's like fucking four o'clock in the afternoon. Oh, I got to just like relax.
[609.86s -> 615.58s]  I got to beat the clown game. Okay. It's over. I'm live. Everything's fine.
[615.58s -> 622.78s]  Everything's fixed. I got to like fucking get over it. Okay. So I'm like fucking happy
[622.78s -> 632.30s]  Gilmore Ray. I swear to God. All right. Welcome to unlock. I don't think I need this
[632.30s -> 642.73s]  anymore. Do I? Maybe I should put that up here. Feels nice. Get a better table.
[643.98s -> 647.50s]  Don't push me right now. I'm already fucking flustered. Don't push me.
[649.66s -> 654.81s]  Okay. So you guys are not going to be able to read these that well. So I just like
[654.81s -> 663.43s]  looked at the fuck. I just saw all the answers. I think the fact there's like a teacher's guide.
[663.43s -> 668.20s]  There's like a teacher's guide. No, I did not. I didn't. Right.
[670.87s -> 674.39s]  There's no, that's not what's on the back. Why did it? Why did it not say don't look at
[674.39s -> 681.67s]  the back? Oh, do I look at that either? Okay. I didn't see anything. I swear to God. How do I
[681.67s -> 689.74s]  get this open without seeing the answers? I swear to God. There is like a full on cheat
[689.74s -> 707.08s]  sheet back here. Do I, am I supposed to open the deck? I am right? The sick feels pretty nice.
[707.08s -> 713.34s]  These are high quality cards. I just, I don't know. I just want to see what it's not like.
[713.34s -> 719.24s]  All right. Tutorial. Welcome to Unlock. You will find all the sensations of an escape room game
[720.97s -> 726.73s]  in this game. You will be confronted with puzzles, codes to decipher, objects to put
[726.73s -> 733.82s]  together and tricks to discover. For this first adventure, you are in, you are at an interview
[733.82s -> 739.50s]  in the Unlocked Secret Society on the top floor of an office building. The manager who welcomes you
[739.50s -> 746.09s]  smirks and leaves you in a seemingly trivial room, locking the door behind him. Oh,
[746.09s -> 758.17s]  a secret society. All right. Here we go. All right. I'm ready. I got to get excited for
[758.17s -> 765.77s]  this shit. This is like in like 10 point font by the way. Hopefully they're not all like
[765.77s -> 775.30s]  this. All right. Launch the app, select the scenario tutorial. Okay. There's like all kinds
[775.30s -> 787.08s]  of weird shit on here. And then press start. You now have 10 minutes to get out of your first
[787.08s -> 793.77s]  unlock adventure. Are you stuck? You may ask for hints in the application by entering the
[793.77s -> 801.99s]  card number. Oh, okay. I gotta go. 10 minutes remaining. Turn this, turn over this card.
[807.74s -> 813.70s]  This is the office. Here is the room where you are locked in. Several elements are visible.
[813.70s -> 816.90s]  You may now search and reveal the five cards whose number you can see.
[821.18s -> 824.94s]  Okay. Search and reveal the five cards whose numbers you can see.
[825.74s -> 833.88s]  You guys get a good look at that. Make sure you can see that. Okay. Okay. Honestly like
[833.88s -> 838.04s]  I will tell you what's happening because I got 10 minutes. Okay. What is it? 20. What card?
[839.00s -> 847.02s]  Search and reveal the five cards whose number you can see. I need 11, 21. There's a fucking
[847.02s -> 853.59s]  million of these. All right. 21. 21. It's going to be 10 minutes to find these. 67.
[857.74s -> 861.58s]  Okay. I gotta put this out in a good area here because this 21 is down here. 67 is up here.
[863.96s -> 867.96s]  Do I have anything else in there that I need? I don't think so. Okay. Wait. Nothing else in
[867.96s -> 885.96s]  there? Okay. 21. 67 is a room up here. 35. 35. 42. Okay. Eight minutes and 33 seconds. Okay.
[885.96s -> 894.60s]  42. And then hold on. Let's get this in a better spot. And 11. All right. Here's the
[894.60s -> 898.52s]  room where you're locked in. Several elements are visible. Okay. I can see a trash can.
[899.00s -> 905.54s]  A desk. A window. A switch. All right. You may now search and reveal the cards. What's
[905.54s -> 917.74s]  over here? We got a key. We've got an exit door. We've got a grid with five centimeter
[917.74s -> 930.41s]  apart pins. Okay. We got a locked cabinet. And we also have a TV screen. Can you guys
[930.41s -> 936.71s]  see this shit? Do I have to like turn the brightness up on the sun? Okay. So we got
[937.27s -> 951.94s]  this is the office here. Key. No. Well, I'll play like this. You can combine this object with a
[951.94s -> 960.10s]  red object or the red number of a machine. To do so, add their numbers together. If the total
[960.10s -> 964.76s]  corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card. So I can combine this with
[964.76s -> 973.37s]  a red object or red number. I can do key and TV. Okay. So should I open the TV with the key?
[973.37s -> 983.24s]  Keys don't have TVs. Add their numbers together. To do so, add their numbers together. If the
[983.24s -> 992.36s]  total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card. 53. No, I can't. I cannot
[992.36s -> 1000.20s]  use the key on TV, guys. A locked cabinet. You can combine this object. Okay. Key on cabinet,
[1000.20s -> 1006.63s]  which means 45, 46. So 46. We're going to do key on. Yeah, there it is. 46. We could
[1006.63s -> 1021.45s]  open that cabinet with this key. So then here we go. Ready? Oh, sick. Very good. The
[1021.45s -> 1029.82s]  cabinet is open. Discard cards 11 and 35. Look closely at the picture. There are two
[1029.82s -> 1042.02s]  interesting elements. If you see a number, reveal the card. We opened it. We opened the
[1042.02s -> 1056.54s]  cabinet. 16. I see it. Okay. Boom. I gotta like turn the sun up. I'm turning up the sun.
[1060.42s -> 1065.26s]  And give me something like music too. No, that's for the dinosaur one. What's
[1065.26s -> 1077.99s]  up with the clown one, right? Let me turn up the sun. There we go. Okay. Now you guys
[1077.99s -> 1084.07s]  can like see what's going on here. Now you can see what's going on. Maybe a little too
[1084.07s -> 1097.29s]  bright. That's better. All right. There we go. So this is a... What is this? Did I
[1097.29s -> 1103.94s]  actually make it worse? Electrical wire. You can find it. Okay. Combine this with a red
[1103.94s -> 1112.18s]  number or... I'm running out of time here. Now it's too bright. So I got a red wire.
[1112.18s -> 1124.57s]  I can add it to a machine. If I have red wire on TV, I think that might be better.
[1125.21s -> 1131.64s]  All right. Red wire on TV. That's what I'm going to say. So that's 16 plus 42
[1132.60s -> 1142.55s]  is 52, 58. No. That can't... No. No wire on TV. Red wire on this weird grid over here,
[1142.55s -> 1151.93s]  possibly. This is a machine. Single... Your first... Your goal is to obtain a single red
[1151.93s -> 1164.30s]  number. Some of them... Then add that number to the blue object modifier. Single red
[1164.30s -> 1171.93s]  number. I don't have a single red number. Are you telling me I can't use that on here?
[1172.65s -> 1180.33s]  What about the exit? I need... There's a four digit... All right. I see a skull right now.
[1180.89s -> 1193.96s]  What am I supposed to do with this wire that ends in rings? I... No. I definitely have to
[1193.96s -> 1203.59s]  put it on here. That's definitely where that red wire goes. Obtain a single sum of one or
[1203.59s -> 1214.66s]  more black numbers. I don't know what the fuck that's even talking about. I can't like
[1214.66s -> 1219.86s]  just use that on here. I can use this on a machine. So that would... But there's no
[1219.86s -> 1235.42s]  cards in here for that. Just crawl under the door. TV is a red number. Yeah. That's... So I
[1235.42s -> 1246.04s]  could... But that... There's no card here that could make any sense. You add these two
[1246.04s -> 1252.31s]  numbers together. 16 and 42. There's no number in here that matches that. Should I just
[1252.31s -> 1263.34s]  flip these cards over and see what they are? I have two minutes left. It's definitely
[1263.34s -> 1284.71s]  this and this. Why would it not be? It's a single red number. I discard these. Should
[1284.71s -> 1297.88s]  I just get it a hint? Take the 16, add two of the numbers on the 67 card. I don't want
[1297.88s -> 1302.73s]  to just... 10 and up, man. I'm not old enough to play this, I don't think.
[1303.45s -> 1319.34s]  So I'll have to combine like two black numbers together? Not these. I don't even
[1319.42s -> 1330.58s]  have a hint. Oh, 16. No, I want a hint. Card number 16 could be inserted into the machine.
[1331.85s -> 1337.38s]  That's what I'm saying. So why... I just did that. So what the hell is going on here?
[1341.61s -> 1344.73s]  If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card. It doesn't.
[1348.33s -> 1360.68s]  Two black numbers plus 16. Like, didn't I discard these? It's a... Discard cards 11 and 35.
[1360.68s -> 1370.74s]  So I discard these. How do I combine two black cards if there's only one available here?
[1377.26s -> 1387.67s]  Use the app. Machine. What? Wait, what? Hold on. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1387.67s -> 1408.71s]  wait. This is the machine? I'm dead. Combine this with a red object or the red number of
[1408.71s -> 1431.05s]  a machine. I have to add two num... Oh, I thought they were talking about like cards.
[1436.14s -> 1441.02s]  Single red number. Sum of one or more of the black numbers. Okay, so I thought they
[1441.10s -> 1447.27s]  were talking about like this shit up here. That's all right. We've only been dead for
[1447.27s -> 1459.24s]  48 seconds. We can come back. Okay, so we need a single red number from four, five,
[1459.24s -> 1471.05s]  four plus two. So then add that. Okay, so what about six plus 16? So we've got to get
[1471.05s -> 1476.74s]  two of these and then it's going to correspond to a card in here. Okay, so 25 minus 16.
[1477.56s -> 1483.16s]  All right, I fucking get it. Don't worry. Everybody relax. It's okay. We're just
[1483.16s -> 1496.74s]  figuring... This is the tutorial. So it's going to be nine, right? Seven, eight, nine,
[1497.38s -> 1502.57s]  plus 16. Okay, I thought I had to like do something with this shit. Apparently not.
[1504.31s -> 1511.35s]  What? Nine. Wrong. I'm going to flip the table in a fucking second and I'm going
[1511.35s -> 1521.00s]  to play like fucking pee pants. I have to enter 67 into the app? No, I don't. No,
[1521.00s -> 1539.88s]  I do not. Oh my fucking God damn it, dude. Are you serious? You lose one minute per error. It is
[1539.88s -> 1545.08s]  best to first understand which are the right pins before using it. Okay. All right. Everybody
[1545.08s -> 1551.32s]  relax. I'm starting to understand here. When you have a machine card, you have to use the
[1551.32s -> 1554.84s]  machine, the actual machine that you have in your hand, which is the iPad device.
[1555.91s -> 1569.02s]  Should have gotten that rose. Okay. So we need to have 25 minus 16. And we've got this here.
[1570.81s -> 1577.22s]  We need nine. So you've got seven in the top left and two in the top right.
[1578.60s -> 1592.54s]  And there you go. Thank you. Okay. I lost a minute. What are you talking about?
[1600.33s -> 1617.67s]  25 minus 16 is nine. I don't understand what's going on. Can you, can you help me?
[1618.79s -> 1629.62s]  I don't fucking understand. A single red number, some or more of the black numbers, right?
[1631.03s -> 1635.27s]  Sum of one or more and then add that to the, to this blue object, which is the wire.
[1637.80s -> 1640.84s]  If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card.
[1645.34s -> 1651.94s]  So why did, why can't it just be, does it have to be a certain,
[1652.98s -> 1664.78s]  how was that? I don't understand. How is seven and two not nine? Why is six plus three,
[1664.78s -> 1689.42s]  nine and seven plus two, not nine. So why I did seven and two and it said wrong cabinet.
[1689.42s -> 1702.31s]  Look at the cabinet. I didn't know that was important information. I didn't know that I,
[1702.31s -> 1715.51s]  all right. I'm going to start to 25. Are you ready? Well done. You have restored the
[1715.59s -> 1725.51s]  electricity by placing the wire on the machine. Discard 16, 46 and 67. 16. Discard. 46. Discard.
[1725.51s -> 1737.37s]  I didn't know I still needed that. Where's 47? It's already discarded. 67 I mean. Got it. All
[1737.37s -> 1746.23s]  right. The power is back on. Plus six. Plus six is a modifier that you can add to a red object
[1746.23s -> 1750.63s]  or the red number of machine. Okay. If the total corresponds to a card in the deck,
[1750.63s -> 1760.86s]  you may reveal that card. 42 plus six. Well played. The screen lights up.
[1761.82s -> 1767.10s]  Seven, two, three, nine. Well played. The screen is on. This should help you out to get out.
[1767.10s -> 1776.30s]  Discards 25 and 42. There it goes. Hey, what you, you can enter a code into the application
[1776.30s -> 1782.41s]  thanks to these four digits. To get out and finish the tutorial, you must enter a four digit
[1782.41s -> 1790.49s]  code into the application. What's that? Code. Seven, two, three, nine. Seven, two, three, nine.
[1792.07s -> 1798.18s]  No. What? No, these are the correct numbers, but they aren't in the right order.
[1801.70s -> 1809.96s]  Oh, it's red. Red, yellow, blue, green. I got to pay attention to these cards.
[1810.52s -> 1823.24s]  It's color coded. Nine, three, nine, three, nine, three, seven, two. All right. All right, boys and
[1823.24s -> 1832.39s]  girls. I did it. I understand it now. I get it. I get it. Check your score. Your time and the
[1832.39s -> 1839.86s]  penalty is in court. 17 minutes. I used one hint. I lost a minute and I got two stars.
[1841.66s -> 1846.81s]  That's not bad. I've never even opened up these decks before. How the fuck am I supposed
[1846.81s -> 1853.45s]  to know? I'm ready. I think I'm ready for squeak sausage. I think I get it. All right.
[1855.38s -> 1868.76s]  All right, here we go. Can you guys see? It's all right. I'll read it to you. All you guys need
[1868.76s -> 1876.30s]  to know is that this is like the Simpsons. Now it is too bright. The sun's like going
[1876.30s -> 1889.94s]  up in a random. I'm going to zoom the fuck in. I got an idea. Is that, you guys can
[1889.94s -> 1899.13s]  probably read that a little bit better. I mean, not really, but that's better, right?
[1900.31s -> 1906.49s]  Enhanced. Now I got this right here for you to check that out. Yeah, there's no way anybody's
[1906.49s -> 1911.05s]  going to read this. So what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to have to like go like this,
[1911.85s -> 1917.67s]  but even still, no, you can't read that. Nobody can. Just trust me. I'm going to read
[1917.67s -> 1922.02s]  it to you and you'll get it. You'll get the gist of it from there. All right. I think
[1922.02s -> 1927.99s]  I'm ready. Are you guys ready? This is called squeak and sausage. This is the clown one.
[1928.63s -> 1935.98s]  So let's get some appropriate music. I need to go get like fucking drinks for this. Here we go.
[1939.34s -> 1946.02s]  I'm going to go get like drunk tonight for this. Not yet though. I'm going from like coffee to
[1946.02s -> 1962.23s]  alcohol. That's not, I'm going to slow down. Okay. Can you see? One, two, three, go. Blasted
[1962.23s -> 1968.39s]  Professor Nose-Side. Once again, your old enemy has stirred up an evil plan, but you have
[1968.39s -> 1974.07s]  courageously slipped into his headquarters to prevent it. While you wander in the corridors of
[1974.07s -> 1979.59s]  this old shack, a trap door opens beneath your feet and you fall into a dark and damp dungeon.
[1981.94s -> 1988.66s]  Your screams will not help you. You are prisoners of the professor. The world is lost forever.
[1988.66s -> 1992.42s]  Unless you can get out of here and sabotage the plans of Nose-Side,
[1993.14s -> 2000.18s]  you are our last hope. Launch the app. Use your iPad and launch the application to get
[2000.18s -> 2011.14s]  out of here. Kids, launch the app and select the scenario. Squeak and sausage. Then press
[2011.14s -> 2018.14s]  start. Oh, squeak and sausage. This is a hard one. This is like two, this is, look at it.
[2018.78s -> 2027.61s]  This is like two locks out of three. Okay, kids. Oh, look, it's got like its own theme too.
[2027.61s -> 2034.74s]  Cool. I'm not going to press the button. Can you see that? All right, here we go.
[2035.30s -> 2043.45s]  Press, what do I have to go to the bathroom? I might have to pee. Do I, can I, do you get to
[2043.45s -> 2050.58s]  pee in the dungeon? Is that, does this not work like that? All right, here we go. You
[2050.58s -> 2062.73s]  have 60 minutes to get out of this adventure. Turn over this card. I'm, you are plunged into
[2062.73s -> 2086.18s]  darkness. What? But what do I do? Is there a number? Anybody see a number? I see a J.
[2086.90s -> 2114.76s]  Is there a J? You guys can't even see. J, I see J. J. There's no J's. Is there, there's no number.
[2114.76s -> 2121.99s]  Here, I'll get you the better camera so you can help me. Does anybody see anything?
[2123.29s -> 2131.26s]  We're going to die down here. It's worse. Does anybody see, I don't see shit. I see a J.
[2142.74s -> 2160.70s]  G? I have no fucking idea. There's too much light in here. There's only a J. But what
[2160.78s -> 2168.30s]  about, wait, wait, what number is the alphabet? J, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, 10. Right? That's
[2168.30s -> 2182.07s]  the number that it's corresponds to. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, there are letters in here.
[2182.07s -> 2196.14s]  There are letters in here. There are letters. See, G, J, J, J, J, J. Look up a J, look up a
[2196.14s -> 2206.31s]  J. Come on. J, I'm going to fucking drop all these cards. Where's J? Where's the J?
[2209.03s -> 2232.71s]  Is T, does anybody see J? I can hear them. I can hear the aliens. Where is
[2232.71s -> 2267.98s]  J? No, pick them up one by one. A, 72, P, this is P, 4. I'm just looking for the flag
[2267.98s -> 2284.17s]  in Double Dare right now. I'm not even playing an escape game. Where is J? This is not even
[2284.17s -> 2324.55s]  in this deck. Am I fucking crazy? I must be crazy. There's no J. There's no J. It's a lie.
[2324.63s -> 2336.17s]  Okay, I take it. All right, I got it. J, you grope in the dark and end up finding. Yes,
[2336.17s -> 2352.79s]  it feels like a light switch. All right, I got it. So that's one. One. I couldn't
[2352.79s -> 2362.82s]  have just started at one. I don't, I don't see anything. Hidden object. What? I just
[2362.82s -> 2368.60s]  canceled something. I just got a hidden object. Wait, I just like pressed the X.
[2368.60s -> 2387.30s]  How do I get back to that? One. Okay, good. Whoa. All right. We can see now.
[2387.30s -> 2396.44s]  Get a good look. Okay, store room. Hallelujah. The room that you were locked in from the start
[2396.44s -> 2403.29s]  is a store room. Okay, we can look at all these other things. Finally, we can see.
[2403.29s -> 2412.74s]  So we got a fridge. We got a TV. We've got a cabinet. What is M? What the hell is M?
[2412.74s -> 2419.77s]  Yeah, you guys take a, okay, ready? Take a screenshot. Like put it up on your screen
[2419.77s -> 2424.34s]  like that. There you go. Okay, now you know where it is. I'm going to say there's a
[2424.34s -> 2428.74s]  little pouch over here. Let's go, let's go for M. I'm going to, what's this thing? M.
[2429.54s -> 2434.41s]  I don't know how much more of this clown music I could take. I'm not, I can't even hear it.
[2435.69s -> 2441.77s]  I can very faintly hear the clown music and it's like probably annoying a lot of people.
[2442.41s -> 2464.74s]  All right, do I discard these now? I feel like I need, I discard this. M. Can I just like
[2464.74s -> 2468.42s]  spread these out on the ground? I'm going to put these on the ground. All right, M.
[2469.14s -> 2481.66s]  Let's see what M is. What the hell does this mean? I'm appearing in, it's like a
[2485.80s -> 2502.62s]  25, 25, 79 and then plus one. They're all, they're all pluses. Strange. Okay,
[2504.90s -> 2509.22s]  so now I mean, I don't know what that means. 91? Let's check out 91.
[2509.86s -> 2525.46s]  It's 90. So I have to add those together somehow. I want to like make my own one of
[2525.46s -> 2540.14s]  these and have some of them like have like, never mind, 91. I'm putting them on the ground.
[2540.70s -> 2545.48s]  Did I already go buy it? No, it's of course the last one that I got here. All right,
[2545.48s -> 2551.59s]  91 is this cabinet over here. Let's see where it is. I'm going to get this in a right spot.
[2551.59s -> 2561.43s]  Let's move these out of the way. So 91 is like a radio, a dilapidated old VCR. So that's
[2561.43s -> 2567.82s]  here. That's what's over the cabinet. You're playing an escape room by yourself. Yeah,
[2567.82s -> 2573.74s]  I got locked down here by myself. I like fell down some weird hole. It's one to six players.
[2573.74s -> 2585.26s]  For those of us that are alone in a room. Okay, VCR. We also got 11. 11 is a TV.
[2587.53s -> 2591.61s]  I'm turning off, I'm turning that fucking music off. I keep hearing the same loop.
[2597.38s -> 2603.62s]  Yeah, I'm not having that play for like a fucking hour. 11. Come on, come on, come on.
[2603.62s -> 2617.34s]  I got 50 minutes. 11. Got it. This is the TV, an ancient TV VCR combo. And weirdly enough, guys,
[2617.34s -> 2623.62s]  what detective work can you see there? The rewind button is broken. It's popped off.
[2624.26s -> 2627.62s]  Why is that? I'm going to have to figure that out. I'm turning this fucking music off
[2628.98s -> 2642.26s]  and I'm going to put on, I'm not putting on doom. Has anybody uploaded like background
[2642.26s -> 2650.41s]  clown music? Here we go. This one, this is creepy circus clown music. Is that any worse?
[2658.60s -> 2666.01s]  Okay. I got, I got, I'm timed. All right. An ancient TV VCR. All right. Now we've got
[2666.01s -> 2672.55s]  avoidable. We got H. See, this is how, this is why you play with two people because like
[2672.55s -> 2679.94s]  somebody's the banker in monopoly. So this is the fridge. Make sure you guys can still see
[2679.94s -> 2684.66s]  everything we're looking at here. Here's the fridge. A high tech refrigerator. It makes ice
[2684.66s -> 2690.34s]  in different shapes. The instructions are simple. Add water. Choose the shape of your ice.
[2691.14s -> 2720.15s]  Enjoy. Okay. So we need what? So now let's see P. That's P, right? P is this door is locked
[2720.15s -> 2725.80s]  with a digital code. Here's the exit. And it's the weird doctor is looking at me. So this
[2725.80s -> 2734.86s]  is the door. And then we got 14, which is this little cabinet over here. That's pretty
[2734.86s -> 2742.60s]  creepy. Actually. He just like staring at the other window 14. There's a lot of little
[2742.60s -> 2750.65s]  scenarios in here. Why do they all have to have the alien sound? This is a different song.
[2751.45s -> 2759.27s]  This is a completely different video. Ooh, a bag containing little seeds. All right. Let's,
[2759.27s -> 2768.41s]  we got them all. Let's take a look. A bag containing seeds with this. I can combine this
[2769.37s -> 2777.94s]  seeds, high tech fridge, an ancient DVR combo to VCR. And then this thing over here with
[2777.94s -> 2800.02s]  pluses and pluses on it. 79 plus. Okay. Put seeds in the VCR seeds in VCR. No, that wouldn't
[2800.02s -> 2810.41s]  fucking do anything. Seeds into this here. So that's 14 plus 30 right now that I can drop
[2810.41s -> 2814.17s]  those in there. I can't drop them in the ice machine. That's like a little game. All right.
[2814.17s -> 2822.97s]  So 14 plus 38. So I need 48, 49, 50, 51, 52. 52. So we're going to combine these. We're
[2822.97s -> 2827.88s]  going to put the seeds into this little like weird machine. Oh, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait,
[2827.88s -> 2838.60s]  wait. No, I have to combine them, right? It's yeah, it's 52. How's your fucking Sunday
[2838.60s -> 2852.95s]  going by the way? What day is it? 52, 52. There it is. It's a machine. So, but yeah,
[2852.95s -> 2859.64s]  but don't I have to combine them? And then machine 38. This machine is special to access
[2859.64s -> 2869.72s]  it into the sum of the four pieces which form it. Some of the four pieces that form it.
[2876.68s -> 2893.29s]  There's one, two, three. Is it 52? The four pieces that form it. 38, one, 25, 79.
[2894.49s -> 2909.18s]  So just add them. Yeah, there's another piece of the maze. If there's another piece of the
[2909.18s -> 2913.74s]  maze, then how do I get from... I'm going to put the fucking seeds into the...
[2916.04s -> 2923.08s]  Makes ice. This is no water, right? These are just seeds. If I get one more of those alien
[2923.08s -> 2930.55s]  spaceships. What about that? 31. Let's try it. Let's do that. Let's try the ice machine.
[2930.55s -> 2951.66s]  31. Okay. 35, 30, 47. Which makes ice in different shapes. Do I need a shape? What about
[2953.54s -> 2971.50s]  this one? A star. 35. Add this result to a blue number. 35. 14. Can I put it in the bag?
[2971.50s -> 2974.70s]  Can I dump it up with the ice in the bag? I don't know. I don't have any water.
[2975.82s -> 2993.45s]  How do I get water? Can I turn the TV on? Put the seeds in the VHS. Yeah, but I don't
[2993.45s -> 3000.01s]  think that... Does a number correspond with that? I don't think it does. Melt the TV.
[3001.46s -> 3017.43s]  Pee into the ice machine. I don't think that's how it works. Pause it. All right. Hold on.
[3017.43s -> 3027.70s]  You can only combine... I'm just trying to think. I'm not cheating. I just had to take a sip.
[3027.70s -> 3039.67s]  When I sip, it doesn't count. A bag containing strange little seeds. An ancient TV VCR,
[3039.67s -> 3049.05s]  but these are... Can I put the seeds into the TV? I feel like I need to combine these two.
[3049.53s -> 3063.90s]  Ugh. 38 requires... I need the other piece of this. So where's the other piece of that?
[3064.54s -> 3073.29s]  Is it like... Hold on. Is there something I can do to find that? You know what I'm saying? Is
[3073.29s -> 3094.23s]  there something on this piece that will show me? Use the VCR. That's not a machine,
[3094.23s -> 3100.22s]  though. 91, that's not a machine. The machine is green. I can't use the VCR. I can't use the
[3100.22s -> 3110.65s]  TV. I can only... I can make ice, but I need water, or whatever. I can make ice cubes
[3111.45s -> 3117.69s]  in different shapes. But then when I have an ice cube, I have to combine that ice cube with a
[3117.69s -> 3141.88s]  blue number. But this is just a bag of seeds. Will it grow into a bush? Am I gonna do a hint
[3141.88s -> 3153.70s]  right now? Okay. I'm gonna... We're gonna do... Here's what I'm gonna do. 31, and I'm gonna
[3153.70s -> 3159.43s]  make... I'm gonna take the... I'm gonna make the... I'm gonna take... I don't know. How about the
[3159.43s -> 3168.23s]  skull? Add this to our tube. Okay, 30. 44. Let's just... What happens with 44? Is 44 in here?
[3169.46s -> 3178.98s]  Will it do anything? See, this is good, because you guys are part of the other people.
[3179.62s -> 3183.54s]  There'd be like four people all being like, hmm, where's the TV? And I'm just... I gotta
[3183.54s -> 3189.64s]  do it on my own. I'm the kind of guy that when somebody starts to say a good idea,
[3189.64s -> 3196.95s]  I finish their sentence with them, and act like I had the idea, too. So I can't do that right
[3196.95s -> 3206.04s]  now. It kind of sucks. So yeah, we take the seeds, and we put it into the... Yeah! That's
[3206.04s -> 3218.31s]  what I was gonna say. Exactly. Yeah, you and I are on the same page. There's no 44 in here.
[3218.31s -> 3234.87s]  So, uh, this 41, so that's not correct. What about one of the other ones? I'll go back.
[3234.87s -> 3244.87s]  Can I just put these two together? 38, 48, 49, 50, 50. I'm gonna look at 52. I'm looking at it.
[3244.87s -> 3250.10s]  That's what I would do. I would say that. That's not it. That's something else.
[3251.48s -> 3267.19s]  That's like a big rat. I don't know what that was. Uh, I don't know what to do.
[3267.83s -> 3286.06s]  The high tech refrigerator. 35 plus 14? 31. 35 plus 14. Ice to the seeds? I'm doing a hint.
[3286.70s -> 3297.86s]  I don't care. A hint for 14. You could always try to plant them, but without soil,
[3297.86s -> 3306.86s]  they're useless. Where am I supposed to get soil? I have 40 minutes to beat this whole
[3306.86s -> 3316.81s]  mission. I'm gonna just... I only have a few options here, and those options are
[3317.69s -> 3326.02s]  just combine these with these. So that's 35. So this is, yeah, so this would be 35
[3326.02s -> 3345.27s]  and 14. Let's just see if it's in here. That's 41. That's 55. 45. Is 45 in here? 41.
[3353.35s -> 3355.91s]  I don't think 40... I don't think there's any 40s in here, but that's 41.
[3357.93s -> 3370.23s]  46. Come on. What? That's not... What are you guys getting 49? 49?
[3372.73s -> 3387.99s]  Well, where are you combining 49 from? What's 49? 35 plus 14 is... Oh, all right. I'm a
[3387.99s -> 3397.83s]  fucking moron. Sorry. I forget sometimes. 49. I don't think it's even in here.
[3400.89s -> 3404.25s]  There's no 49. What's stuck here for... We're dead, and we're gonna die in here.
[3404.25s -> 3418.95s]  This is 46. We're literally going to die down here. Yeah, guys. We're dead. We're
[3418.95s -> 3431.82s]  dead down here. We're gonna starve to death. There's a fucking number on here. There's a
[3431.82s -> 3444.82s]  number. Do you see that? There's a number right there. It's tiny. It's 18. God damn
[3444.82s -> 3455.51s]  it. All right. There's 18 down there. Should I just grab 18? Do I have to combine it with
[3455.51s -> 3476.33s]  something? 18. No. The VCR has 18 down underneath. 49 and 18. No, no, no, no, no. Wait.
[3477.93s -> 3485.27s]  Why would we go water to seeds into the VCR? I just have to get 18. I see it. I'm like
[3485.27s -> 3501.85s]  looking at it, right? 18. I don't understand this at all. There's 18 on this VCR, but what
[3501.85s -> 3510.63s]  does that even mean? I'm gonna look at 18. If there's no 18 in here, I'm throwing the
[3510.63s -> 3537.75s]  deck in the air. 89, 39, C, 18. All right. Crisis averted. Got it. A VHS cassette comes
[3537.75s -> 3546.25s]  out of the video recorder with difficulty. All right. Now I got, now I got VCR into the,
[3546.25s -> 3566.38s]  uh, should I play it? Into the TV. 18 plus 11. Into the TV. That gives us 28, 29, 39. What?
[3566.38s -> 3575.86s]  It's 29. 29. It only took us, it only took me. I'll be honest with you. I'll be real.
[3575.86s -> 3581.43s]  It took me that much time. Gotta pay more attention to the random shit that's all over
[3581.43s -> 3589.30s]  these things. 29. There it is. What is it? Boom. The cassette is not rewound and the rewind
[3589.30s -> 3595.10s]  button on the old VCR combo is unfortunately damaged. It takes time to come out. Press
[3595.10s -> 3614.58s]  the penalty button. Three minutes at such precious time! What? What's the fucking point
[3614.90s -> 3626.09s]  of the VCR? So what do I do with the fucking, I discard this, right? That's what, that's what
[3626.09s -> 3638.33s]  that means. I think I throw this away. What is the point of the fucking, so I hurt myself
[3638.33s -> 3643.45s]  and now I have just a random tape and that don't work. Is there anything on the rewind
[3643.45s -> 3663.43s]  button? Use the, use the VCR back into here. 18 and 91. Machine 91. No, I've, what is it?
[3664.39s -> 3676.81s]  Is that going to work? 18 and 91 is... 90. 90. 90. 90. 19. Uh, 91. 99. 109. Okay,
[3677.53s -> 3690.46s]  there's definitely not a 109 in here. This is no way. They're all double digit numbers. No,
[3690.46s -> 3697.16s]  there's no triple digits in here. No, that's not going to work. I just spent all this time
[3697.16s -> 3703.32s]  for no reason. Putting a stupid cassette into a t, into a TV for no reason. No, there are
[3703.32s -> 3711.80s]  no triple digits guys and this is I 91 doesn't do anything so what the hell am
[3711.80s -> 3721.84s]  I supposed to do with this um I thought that was gonna be it too was the tape
[3721.84s -> 3730.98s]  the tape says please be kind rewind there's nothing else on it but I can't
[3730.98s -> 3735.30s]  rewind it I can't can I put it back in here and then hit the rewind button
[3735.30s -> 3742.74s]  no the rewind button is broken on here are there any more fucking like
[3742.74s -> 3750.51s]  numbers that are hidden in here I don't see any what about on the door
[3751.15s -> 3772.13s]  nothing on his face nothing in the pouch no this is still I need four of these
[3773.01s -> 3804.48s]  have we ever seen anything look at chat what are you talking about what's this my my kimasi
[3804.48s -> 3826.45s]  my kimasi 79 no but these are that's that's the artist fuck wait where is anything I'm
[3826.45s -> 3841.47s]  almost going to lose and we have like a thousand cards remaining 91 minus 18 what do
[3841.55s -> 3853.22s]  we mean minus 18 why would we mind that we don't minus from the cards yeah 91 is is
[3853.22s -> 3860.21s]  discarded at this point look see on the top 91 has an x through it once this came out
[3860.21s -> 3878.05s]  I had to get rid of 91 um I'm gonna uh I'm gonna get a hint for 31 I'm gonna get a hint
[3878.05s -> 3889.28s]  for 31 what shape might you actually need and most of all what for no a heart a skull or
[3889.28s -> 3900.53s]  star doesn't do anything for me at all zero what do you mean what shape do I need I don't
[3900.53s -> 3918.42s]  there are no shapes that I need there's a crack through the tv the rewind button is broken and
[3918.42s -> 3929.34s]  there's a light on the top left is it anything else I can't see anything else on here you've
[3929.34s -> 3949.12s]  made zero progress yeah I'm very well aware okay I'm gonna use a hint for 11 you must
[3949.20s -> 3966.30s]  rewind the tape manually what are you talking about rewind the tape manually this shit's 81
[3966.30s -> 3984.00s]  it's 81 are you kidding me are you fucking serious rewind the tape rewind the tape huh 18

[4015.36s -> 4041.23s]  discard 18 unbelievable okay 81 plus 11 a bunch of bullshit you gotta start thinking
[4041.23s -> 4050.45s]  outside the box here all right 81 plus 11 get it together bang put it in it was 92
[4052.98s -> 4072.03s]  you found out my diabolical puzzle there was no puzzle bang there comes hey the despicable
[4072.03s -> 4078.99s]  professor no sign appears you're at my mercy I will destroy this planet and no one not even
[4078.99s -> 4096.21s]  you can stop my evil plan oh that's it discard 11 and 81 uh what's on the tv anything I see
[4096.21s -> 4117.38s]  hee-hee so what was the point of this I see hee-hee hee-hee 34 34 34 is it 34 plus 34
[4119.74s -> 4130.38s]  what are these puzzles is it just 34 this guy like vaped and blew up like a riddler puzzle
[4130.38s -> 4154.26s]  like give me a break 34 is it in here either that or it's 34 plus 34 32 13 come on I only
[4154.26s -> 4163.95s]  have 20 minutes to beat this it's there's no 34 in here 34 right what's 34 and 34 34 30 68
[4170.85s -> 4202.75s]  68 come on 68 no that was correct 63 56 32 57 13 58 83 50 foot stop bingo 68 what do you mean

[4245.09s -> 4249.25s]  appears you're at my mercy I will destroy this planet I will destroy this planet
[4249.89s -> 4259.74s]  destroy this planet 34 34 what about the door that's what about the door
[4261.07s -> 4273.98s]  two wait what do you mean code 34 34 got it the door creaks open into a new room
[4274.85s -> 4300.02s]  take the card f I spent so much time like rifling through these f look at me okay
[4301.20s -> 4310.43s]  get rid of p and get rid of 92 I still have this fridge I still have the maze I still have
[4310.43s -> 4321.31s]  my pack of seeds so we've got a the hq the hq looks like we got a it's like a living room
[4322.11s -> 4328.75s]  a desk another piece of the maze a door and then seven is like a bunch of locks all over it
[4330.22s -> 4349.36s]  I gotta go all right see let's check the just the table first see I'm splitting them up we're
[4349.36s -> 4359.04s]  gonna have numbers and letters you might think that's cheating if it's not it's very much
[4359.04s -> 4369.25s]  not cheating z e c I need c c c c c c c c c c c there's c okay got it right here
[4370.43s -> 4383.38s]  okay great c bang it's a desk oh my fucking god we just another layer we just put another layer
[4383.38s -> 4393.12s]  on here um okay um a tidy desk it must be here that no side puts the finishing touches
[4393.12s -> 4408.14s]  on his evil plans look inside of z oh fuck I need like more don't drop these please
[4408.78s -> 4419.55s]  get this up here I can't handle this fucking music anymore give me something else oh my god
[4422.82s -> 4433.22s]  no thank god I thought it was not playing okay what is uh we got how about this one this one
[4433.22s -> 4439.68s]  seems fine this is scary uh creepy halloween clown music all right sounds good all right I
[4439.68s -> 4443.36s]  got 17 visit c c c c c let me look inside the maze there's a maze there I want to look
[4443.36s -> 4453.38s]  inside of it got it okay I got all these numbers now see there are one two three four
[4453.38s -> 4456.42s]  five of these numbers but wait a minute that's not this there's more there's another piece down
[4456.42s -> 4461.22s]  here this is not even the right one this is the wrong one that's that doesn't connect correctly
[4461.22s -> 4474.43s]  all right that was z t t is this like color-coded wheel down here no okay this draw is locked
[4474.43s -> 4478.91s]  with a digital code so that I gotta get inside the draw okay get inside I got that this is
[4478.91s -> 4488.70s]  like that's I got that's the ultimate goal here 24 24 is the glass of water it looks
[4488.70s -> 4492.86s]  like on the table here although good luck looking at seeing that good thing you got
[4492.86s -> 4511.92s]  me here to explain it 24 there's got a glass of water oh I just the water okay simple glass
[4511.92s -> 4516.48s]  of water this is one of my items it's going up here so I got my pouch of seeds my water
[4519.25s -> 4531.41s]  and then the fridge so I can do 24 plus 31 get the right hydrate you got it I gotta
[4531.41s -> 4545.58s]  all right hold on I gotta pull this out so you can see more oh don't I'll show them to
[4545.58s -> 4548.99s]  you but you guys you guys need to be able to see more because we're getting way too many
[4548.99s -> 4555.10s]  items there we go that's a little better okay I'm getting more items so you can know what we have
[4555.82s -> 4561.90s]  I'm expanding we're expanding okay so this is at 24 what wait don't go anywhere check this
[4561.90s -> 4569.41s]  before do you see anything on there I'm just waiting for somebody in chat to say something
[4569.41s -> 4581.62s]  I don't see anything no hidden numbers no hidden thing I don't see shit I think that's
[4581.62s -> 4587.38s]  it so that was c now we're gonna go to a a is the other puzzle piece I think on the side
[4587.38s -> 4597.66s]  of the wall there do you remember I told you how I kept on hearing the alien pause it
[4597.66s -> 4603.66s]  do you remember when I told you I was hearing the alien sound and I was like shut the fuck
[4603.66s -> 4609.41s]  up this fucking alien sound is pissing me off it's coming from here it's actually like
[4609.41s -> 4623.52s]  sounds on the ipad uh I'll show you how do I like turn the volume up all right
[4623.52s -> 4647.04s]  take I'm gonna take a pic of you guys you ready this is the maybe this music was just
[4647.12s -> 4665.49s]  playing that's enough of that all right what we're doing a right oh hey yeah here we go I have 14
[4665.49s -> 4681.28s]  minutes I turned off the music okay here we go oh music got it louder 46 minutes gone I know I
[4681.28s -> 4686.96s]  know we're just learning all right hey I need more space okay sorry I just fucking bumped into
[4688.08s -> 4692.56s]  a there's another one of these god damn it there's gonna be another one there's gonna
[4692.56s -> 4697.39s]  be four of these fucking things how the hell am I gonna figure this out there's like
[4697.39s -> 4707.41s]  10 numbers on here well that's the correct one there and this is not correct yes it is
[4710.77s -> 4720.67s]  fuck this fuck you table sucks okay that's a uh what about three four three or seven
[4721.23s -> 4742.38s]  let's go three there we go kitchen please do not enter so this is the kitchen can I like
[4742.38s -> 4750.10s]  skull on the fucking door get skull ice cube put it in the door got it uh before we go let's see
[4750.10s -> 4765.90s]  seven seven is an entrance and obviously an exit and there's also v there's another layer
[4765.90s -> 4771.36s]  here I gotta put these together I gotta fuck I'm this is starting to freak me out all right
[4772.00s -> 4780.80s]  let's move this so this is this door this code goes I'm gonna do like this because I'm
[4781.12s -> 4785.12s]  starting to get a lot of things here let's go like that so these are connected together
[4786.24s -> 4791.62s]  and then this is so I need v now which is another like a close-up of the door
[4797.18s -> 4808.22s]  v what did I just open the door the door opens onto a pretty garden in the middle of which
[4808.22s -> 4814.62s]  stands no sides shed laboratory you need to enter an aggressive guard dog stands in front
[4814.62s -> 4819.42s]  of it it's the impossible to get past it's impossible to get past while the monster is
[4819.42s -> 4834.42s]  still here okay so he has a guard dog that just sits out front all right um well shit now um
[4835.30s -> 4842.03s]  go back so this is the water I can do that I can get the cube so I have the water which
[4842.03s -> 4852.64s]  gives me number 31 which gives me 30 so machine we're gonna do 31 get the skull
[4855.49s -> 4869.62s]  add this result to a blue number 30 and 24 go back let me go back hold on one thing at a time
[4871.74s -> 4897.23s]  so this and this makes the ice cube which is 34 55 56 55 55 55 54 31 and 24 is 55 yes it is
[4898.03s -> 4905.65s]  is there no 55 shit what do you 54 31 41 oh it's the
[4906.70s -> 4916.30s]  ah it's not the number up here it's the number right there it's 54 no don't leave game
[4928.96s -> 4941.62s]  54 got it ice in the shape of a skull discard um what discard 11 h and 24
[4943.22s -> 4947.86s]  discard where's what is what number what is this h or 11 I don't have an 11
[4947.86s -> 4956.59s]  I don't see 11 what number is it is it h or 11 it's too blurry because this webcam sucks
[4957.90s -> 4972.27s]  and even though it's new it don't matter what did I not discard I h I don't have that all
[4972.27s -> 4982.30s]  right so now we're gonna do 54 into three which is the skull so we're gonna do 54 55
[4982.30s -> 4989.98s]  56 57 this is gonna get into the kit we're gonna have like a whole
[4989.98s -> 4992.70s]  another like thing to do I'm gonna have to get like another table
[4996.43s -> 5005.50s]  56 where's 57 57 opens the door fucking god damn it get rid of three and 54 you got it
[5005.50s -> 5027.14s]  the kitchen oh shit ah there you can see good good view this so we've got a stove
[5029.01s -> 5034.13s]  a microwave and then a weird thing over here next to the sink 40 we're gonna do let's go
[5034.13s -> 5049.70s]  to the stove first the stove is 89 89 I can do this shit in a minute 89 got it okay let's
[5049.70s -> 5057.76s]  open the stove it's an oven in which little cakes are baking a message is stuck on the
[5057.76s -> 5070.18s]  door and that's the message is 73 73 okay 73 is the I need to get 73 there's the stove
[5070.26s -> 5091.26s]  okay stove oven 73 is the note on the door 77 51 36 73 oh I can't read this fucking thing
[5091.26s -> 5103.65s]  it's so small dear the message left by the oven probably by the cook dear professor here are
[5103.65s -> 5108.77s]  the chalk cheddar cupcakes you asked for I've gone to do some shopping if you could just
[5108.77s -> 5115.25s]  add the cheese at the right time it would help me ps to stop the cheddar being eaten by you know
[5115.25s -> 5121.41s]  who I've locked it in the cupboard I won't give you the code I know you love deduction games
[5121.41s -> 5127.12s]  given your intelligence you shouldn't have any problems guessing it ps don't burn everything
[5127.12s -> 5134.75s]  like last time all right the cheddar if you just add the cheese at the right time would help me
[5136.11s -> 5140.67s]  stop the cheddar by being eaten by the mouse we already got spoiled on that unfortunately
[5140.67s -> 5145.57s]  it's locked in the cupboard I won't give you the code I know you love deduction so we gotta
[5145.57s -> 5154.34s]  get the code to the cupboard cupboard is 63 let's go go go I have to get another
[5154.34s -> 5161.68s]  fuck you table I think 63 bingo here it is a cupboard shut with a combination lock
[5161.68s -> 5171.28s]  contains cheese and flies so here's the lock to this so this is the lock it's a four digit
[5171.28s -> 5182.70s]  code we got E E is another one of these is the oh shit this looks like a sausage on it
[5182.70s -> 5194.40s]  okay so that's complete now but what the hell how do I get to the sausage okay hold on
[5195.36s -> 5204.50s]  I've got six minutes to beat this so hold on 41 is another I can get I look at something else
[5204.50s -> 5216.05s]  here 41 there's a little like a window to look through 41 is a window a poster of
[5216.05s -> 5226.77s]  questionable taste decorates the decrepit wall questionable taste uh purple red green
[5227.65s -> 5231.94s]  oh wait that that that that that that that hold on hold on hey look at this
[5239.04s -> 5252.50s]  how many purple all right I got it no I don't there are one two three there are one two three
[5253.14s -> 5265.84s]  four five six seven purple one two three four five green and then one two three four five six
[5267.57s -> 5278.32s]  orange but how does that correspond to this this four numbers is it just the same one two three
[5278.32s -> 5285.06s]  four five six so it's just gonna be six six we're gonna lose it's obvious very obvious
[5285.06s -> 5293.90s]  we're gonna lose this one but who cares this is fun okay so it's seven six seven six five six
[5295.23s -> 5302.29s]  you got it done seven six is gonna this is the desk over here so seven six five six
[5303.44s -> 5314.38s]  so I need to do a code into code seven six five six the drawer slides open it's overflowing
[5314.38s -> 5332.83s]  with papers and various documents what the fuck is wrong with me I forgot like where I was all
[5332.83s -> 5347.94s]  right pause it this doesn't count anymore what was it I don't even know what the card just told
[5347.94s -> 5357.34s]  me seven six shut up I don't want to hear you I want to hear my music the creepy one
[5359.63s -> 5363.95s]  and I already see people clipping it and that's great I'm pausing it no wait I need to
[5366.82s -> 5374.40s]  seven six five six draw opens I need card number nine card I'm pausing it I don't care card number
[5374.40s -> 5386.99s]  nine that's like I just got like a surprise birthday present number nine what's in it
[5386.99s -> 5395.46s]  all right what do you guys think's in here all right get rid of t and get rid of 41
[5396.42s -> 5404.21s]  finally I can start to actually discard this shit what that leaves us with these rooms the

[5797.55s -> 5811.14s]  no that's a lie you guys can hear this you don't hear this that's bullshit
[5817.06s -> 5827.60s]  ah countdown timer I thought I heard like an explosion
[5830.16s -> 5835.66s]  oh okay the countdown has finished but time continues you can finish the adventure all right
[5835.66s -> 5841.82s]  well at least you got the background music all right so I gotta start let's put that up here
[5843.26s -> 5846.54s]  I gotta find the right one now bear with me here because this is really little
[5849.81s -> 5860.43s]  sausage out this way um up here no this way around no it's hard to do this they're not
[5860.43s -> 5903.07s]  connected right fucking come on man okay I'm gonna draw on this I need to I have to
[5904.19s -> 5932.32s]  they all blend together like a magic eye wait hold on fuck god damn okay it's not nine
[5932.96s -> 5965.78s]  what about this one 18 18 plus that's not 18 plus has to come through this way
[5976.13s -> 5992.30s]  god damn it I'm gonna get a pen use the iPad what do you mean use the iPad wait hold on this
[5992.30s -> 6011.55s]  is a machine it's a machine so uh 38 enter the sum of the four pieces okay 26 plus 21
[6011.55s -> 6034.70s]  plus 38 plus 15 38 48 49 51 53 53 63 73 74 84 94 100 no that's not right 26 36 46 47
[6036.06s -> 6049.23s]  57 58 to 9 60 61 62 72 82 now it's 100 there's no 100 in here oh my fucking god damn it
[6060.86s -> 6080.96s]  all right so um can I draw what do you guys think no not that way it is it's gonna be over
[6080.96s -> 6095.23s]  here somewhere so down here around this thing up and down right here oh it's that's whatever
[6095.23s -> 6115.58s]  is this one right add this number to a blue number one plus 15 15 because the seeds no
[6116.30s -> 6133.44s]  I don't have a number I don't have them I need them I the pills no wouldn't be well I
[6133.44s -> 6155.10s]  I need the sausage what am I missing here I need like the mouse 63 63 is locked I gotta pee so bad
[6155.10s -> 6293.02s]  the oven I gotta pee so fucking bad I brought back I almost just knocked over all this shit
[6293.98s -> 6301.63s]  I was really close okay so how do I I need to get a mouse or a rat or something
[6302.35s -> 6315.76s]  we're back okay I need a mouse or a rat to get the cheese inside of this maze
[6316.32s -> 6325.66s]  how would you do that do you think a cupboard shut with a combination lock contains cheese and
[6325.66s -> 6331.02s]  flies I have the recipe for the cheese recipe is there anything else on here
[6331.74s -> 6337.15s]  there are the sleeping pills the recipe the instructions and then there's a book ah there's
[6337.15s -> 6345.30s]  a book in here take a look at that book you can't see it that well but there is a 37 on that
[6345.30s -> 6353.49s]  left book I am seriously like sometimes I think that like I'm the smartest fucking person in the
[6353.49s -> 6374.21s]  room yeah I am I'm the only person in the room 37 37 so I am technically the smartest person
[6374.21s -> 6379.52s]  in this room but I also might be I could you know I could be the dumbest person in the room
[6381.54s -> 6388.83s]  oh yeah I am the smartest and stupidest fucking person in this room there's nobody else in here
[6388.83s -> 6392.77s]  I'm also the most handsome person in the room I'm also the ugliest person in the room
[6392.77s -> 6423.14s]  okay uh this is notes music score three three three one three five is there a piano
[6423.78s -> 6434.56s]  I don't see like a piano or something three three three one three five I don't understand
[6434.56s -> 6446.62s]  how that plays into anything else but it is a musical score nothing else on here right
[6447.26s -> 6465.79s]  this is probably the code this could also be just added together but if it's 18 then
[6465.79s -> 6478.50s]  but what would that why would that matter is there 18 still in here I don't think 18
[6478.50s -> 6490.53s]  still in here 18 was already out yeah well 18 was the uh the cassette tape musical score
[6490.53s -> 6500.75s]  maybe the stove I can't like put that away for now let me see if there's anything else
[6501.39s -> 6507.98s]  there's the door with the dog there's nothing else on there there's a doggy door there's the
[6507.98s -> 6512.38s]  cage with the cheese in it there's the fridge with the ice in it that I think I'm supposed to
[6513.47s -> 6517.31s]  yeah I'm supposed to get rid of that okay I have seeds I have sleeping pills
[6518.27s -> 6525.76s]  there's the kitchen the maze which is already done but I need the mouse so I need to do
[6525.76s -> 6542.37s]  this shit in the kitchen I gotta do the stove okay cheese and all right let me see this
[6545.60s -> 6552.19s]  page torn this is the recipe book the start time of the oven is 1217 and it's 300 degrees
[6553.76s -> 6559.31s]  fill the molds with this delicious mixture and bake for 30 minutes at 300 so that started
[6559.31s -> 6566.78s]  at three 30 minutes and now it's at 12 minutes and 17 seconds which then bleeds into
[6569.31s -> 6582.99s]  is could that be is that four digits is it just this oven timer thing let's see code 1217
[6586.61s -> 6606.56s]  now it's not 1217 that's wrong is it whatever was before that it's not 8008 it's not that
[6610.56s -> 6622.16s]  I have no idea add the cheese at the right time the cheese is locked up it's locked up
[6622.16s -> 6631.39s]  because the mouse is going to eat it don't burn everything these are in the oven already
[6631.39s -> 6639.86s]  is it maybe it's the time that it already was cooking for I think it's the time it was
[6639.86s -> 6663.90s]  already in there for it's a 30 minus 12 seven that's what 17 minutes and 17 17 um 30 40 17
[6663.90s -> 6679.42s]  40 to 43 come on what what the fuck what is it then how do I get this mouse what is
[6679.42s -> 6698.96s]  this musical score for what are these the pouch of the seeds for uh sleeping pill sleeping
[6698.96s -> 6711.49s]  pill for I did wait did I do that wrong all right I'm gonna use a hint hint for 89
[6713.89s -> 6725.36s]  the cooking started at 12 17 p.m. therefore oh that's that's what time it is
[6727.66s -> 6744.24s]  30 minutes it's a 12 third it's gonna be 12 47 got it you open the cupboard and take the
[6744.24s -> 6753.92s]  cheese that's hidden behind a cloud of flies take the card 32 all right sometimes you gotta
[6753.92s -> 6764.30s]  use a hint and we're like 20 minutes over but it's okay 32 a small piece of cheddar
[6765.25s -> 6770.69s]  matured for 18 months all right I got a lot of things to discard here oh don't drop the whole
[6770.69s -> 6781.55s]  deck well I must drop a whole deck okay get rid of uh 68 or 63 which is the one we just
[6781.55s -> 6803.66s]  opened 63 get rid of 73 78 so get rid of 73 78 63 89 okay so 63 73 78 89 freeing up some
[6803.66s -> 6814.48s]  space here all right get that over here so now I have a piece of cheese cheese plus the maze
[6815.98s -> 6832.45s]  I think cheese because that would mean the mouse would come in no I need cheese plus um
[6833.49s -> 6844.43s]  the dog door cheese in the in the sleeping pill because that no no no hold on can I add
[6845.57s -> 6853.15s]  no no no no no okay hold wait wait wait so hold on go back to here this was 100
[6854.61s -> 6860.64s]  and it was which one this one right I don't I really just don't remember I think it is this one
[6861.68s -> 6876.13s]  there's a mouse in the kitchen just yelled at me there's a mouse in the kitchen oh god
[6876.13s -> 6888.26s]  damn it guys deep deep deep in that hole there is a tiny little faint 20 you can barely
[6888.26s -> 6914.96s]  see it 20 there is a mouse hole 20 plus 32 is going to give us the mouse 52 it's right here
[6914.96s -> 6927.34s]  bingo found him he looks so sad lord by the cheese a mouse comes out of the hole you have
[6927.34s -> 6933.81s]  difficulty catching it but you succeed in the end now we do this and the fucking maze
[6934.45s -> 6946.67s]  well I gotta clean this up move this over here looks pretty good all right I think I can get
[6946.67s -> 6951.82s]  rid of this shit I don't think I'm okay so now I which one was it it was up here right this
[6951.82s -> 6968.11s]  one so now 52 plus so 53 because that's we already got that one 53 I think it's in the
[6968.11s -> 6994.06s]  back I thought I saw it already 53 no no just no no all right so what what do you mean no
[7003.14s -> 7019.84s]  okay I have maze correct maze and mouse is not the right answer correct what was it the wrong
[7019.84s -> 7035.55s]  was it the wrong place to go was the wrong maze all right um I guess like let's try this
[7035.55s -> 7063.81s]  one over here it must be this one then no it's not no these are all wrong none of these are
[7063.81s -> 7089.20s]  none of these are even right this music sucks I don't even know what it is what's the Halloween
[7089.20s -> 7098.96s]  music how about um here I'll make everybody happy for like five seconds let's put on Yoshi's
[7098.96s -> 7117.98s]  Island everybody thought it was going to be doomed but you're wrong all right that's cute
[7119.87s -> 7124.86s]  I'm getting to the end here in like another three hours so what's my no that was correct
[7124.86s -> 7135.73s]  because look at all these other ones oh shit okay hold on 52 plus nine
[7145.58s -> 7168.91s]  60 60 61 all right this is it right no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[7169.79s -> 7189.98s]  I'm seeing a lot of resident sleepers I'm gonna have to wake you guys up oh no no that
[7189.98s -> 7198.54s]  was a bad idea because I'll just pretend I didn't do that I was trying to wake everybody up oh it's
[7198.54s -> 7205.65s]  because of the lullaby and here I am thinking I gotta like do something crazy to wake everybody
[7205.65s -> 7211.86s]  up and it's the fucking music that's playing and I'm I just added I just ruined the whole
[7211.86s -> 7218.30s]  playthrough for myself I thought everyone was like oh shit like this I'm bored and I'm just
[7218.30s -> 7226.18s]  like oh yeah fuck it's all right there's gonna be like 40 penalties but it's not real so
[7226.18s -> 7232.59s]  okay so what the hell is what do I do then so it's not that one's not this one maybe it's
[7232.59s -> 7261.65s]  this one the one that starts in the corner over here this is it that's not it got it 77
[7267.98s -> 7272.38s]  snossage all right I got it a sausage it was released when the mouse went over the opening
[7272.38s -> 7279.84s]  button of the maze's trap door big subs came you know fuck they did uh cyanide thank you
[7279.84s -> 7287.34s]  for the 10 community subs cyanide appreciate that thank you for the 10 community subs much
[7287.34s -> 7292.54s]  love to you thank you uh we got the sausage and that means I can get rid of all this
[7299.82s -> 7306.83s]  and I can get rid of c4 and 52 mouse is gone desk does not need to be used anymore
[7306.83s -> 7317.63s]  c4 and 52 okay all right we've cleaned up the space a little bit now I can take the
[7317.71s -> 7327.92s]  the sausage and the dog right so I can take 77 plus 49 that's not gonna do anything though
[7328.48s -> 7343.68s]  I have this sausage anything on the sausage sausage and the pill here all right yeah let's bingo
[7344.56s -> 7367.58s]  so that's 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 83 83 it's a sausage sleep but the sausage can send anybody
[7367.58s -> 7374.05s]  into the arms of Morpheus I don't know what Morpheus is supposed to be but now we have 83
[7375.55s -> 7386.42s]  which can be used on the monster right so 83 there's a little doggie door 83 and 7
[7387.14s -> 7395.46s]  put it like in front of the door that sounds about right I think that's a good idea so 83
[7395.46s -> 7406.99s]  and 7 let's get 90 maybe he'll come through the door there it is sausage on the door
[7407.87s -> 7413.50s]  you open the door slightly and carefully throw the sausage in the garden noises of something
[7413.50s -> 7418.94s]  being wolfed down can be heard immediately after a few seconds chewing noises are replaced by deep
[7418.94s -> 7424.70s]  snores the dog has fallen asleep he will finally be able to get out but no side's voice suddenly
[7424.70s -> 7432.21s]  comes from a loudspeaker did you really think it would work so easily and I let you go
[7432.21s -> 7437.57s]  like that click clack the door is now locked the evil professor really does not want you
[7437.57s -> 7459.79s]  to save the earth take card five 783 783 and v all right take card five this music doesn't
[7459.79s -> 7471.23s]  really fit but it's okay five what's the big secret here the door is now locked so there's
[7471.23s -> 7481.74s]  no reason to do any of that what which is back into the door is now locked there's just a big
[7481.74s -> 7510.40s]  key anything else on the door what the hell am I supposed to do now seeds on the door what's
[7510.40s -> 7518.70s]  that going to do a bag of magic seeds that's not going to do anything do I still do something
[7518.70s -> 7532.19s]  with this the musical note I can't climb through the doggy door it's not going to work can I do
[7532.19s -> 7550.45s]  seeds on but why would that work 19 no sprinkle the seeds in front of the door that's not going

[7782.02s -> 7793.09s]  didn't I need soil I need soil for the seeds okay hold on here this fucking
[7793.09s -> 7796.93s]  super Nintendo music I'm not sure if it's keeping people or driving people away
[7797.49s -> 7801.89s]  and thank you cyanide for the 10 more community I got it right away thank you for the 10
[7801.89s -> 7809.58s]  community sub sign I appreciate it 10 more on top of the ones you gave earlier too thank you
[7810.46s -> 7823.78s]  all right um R you need to get in this room contains a weapon of mass destruction
[7824.42s -> 7839.17s]  okay inside his shed is like a nuclear bomb of some sort okay so that's it so let's go
[7839.17s -> 7844.77s]  ahead and think about this we're going to do the soil and the seeds so that's 58 plus 14
[7844.77s -> 7861.25s]  is 58 69 61 62 64 5 6 7 7 7 7 172 tada the seeds are well planted in the nourishing
[7861.49s -> 7868.08s]  soil so now we've got seeds in the soil get rid of these two cards now we don't need them anymore
[7869.55s -> 7879.66s]  sick okay now we get the we got to do the water here so 50 machine 56 all right so I need to
[7880.38s -> 7884.80s]  the water inlet pipes have fallen down you must find the right ones to get water
[7885.44s -> 7904.02s]  but how do I which one goes first left find the right ones
[7904.02s -> 7915.66s]  once one okay hold on do I press this button and then hit okay no I'm trying but what do
[7915.66s -> 7924.18s]  you mean find the right ones I need one I need one two three I need like four of them
[7925.22s -> 7938.05s]  or three of them I can't like drag and drop though it's one connection two three maybe three
[7938.05s -> 7944.11s]  of them it looks like this one here so it needs to go like down down this one
[7944.83s -> 7952.22s]  do I have to press them all okay I'm an idiot all right so it's this one and then we need
[7952.22s -> 7960.38s]  like a little snake one so this one and then we need the this one how does that make any
[7960.38s -> 7974.35s]  sense we talk about lose one minute yeah because look it goes I need one that goes
[7974.43s -> 7981.39s]  down like this so it's this one here right that makes sense that's right there
[7982.27s -> 7990.75s]  and then anyone that goes bang bang bang which is bad it's this one here and then one that
[7990.75s -> 8004.91s]  goes bang bang straight down it's this one right here how's that wrong yes yes this is it
[8007.09s -> 8013.23s]  yes I did it right yes I did it everyone's five it's everyone's like dancing I must have
[8013.23s -> 8051.55s]  done it what so two three nine that's nine nine plus 72 wait wait wait it's not even it's not
[8051.55s -> 8067.86s]  showing the other side why is it not showing the bottom left hold on a minute this it's
[8067.86s -> 8081.12s]  not showing me the whole thing over here so it needs to go down down down down okay okay
[8081.12s -> 8091.97s]  I got it I got it so it's because this is not on here that's bullshit so it is this one
[8093.68s -> 8100.91s]  and then it goes this one and then it has to go to the other one down there so it's this one
[8110.69s -> 8117.07s]  I have no idea what the fuck is going on here because I don't know why it's missing these ones
[8117.07s -> 8130.85s]  on this wouldn't it just be all of them except for one because it would be this I don't even I
[8130.85s -> 8137.02s]  don't understand why you would even you got all these numbers here what are the numbers for
[8137.66s -> 8141.57s]  at least everyone's having a fucking fun time dancing I must be doing something right
[8142.85s -> 8158.83s]  all right so then 16 plus 72 because of obviously this 72 88 bingo was it growing
[8159.39s -> 8172.14s]  piranha plants massive subs just came in holy god 20 community subs atrox atrox give 20
[8172.14s -> 8184.66s]  community subs holy fuck that's thank you that's a lot thank you so much for the 20 subs
[8189.92s -> 8197.58s]  that's a lot of subs 56 can go 72 can go I can't wait till if I like Moran kids play this
[8198.30s -> 8205.95s]  oh the flowers grow instantly both a magical and beautiful show so what what did that even do
[8205.95s -> 8214.90s]  for us is there something wait a minute there's uh the different colors orange purple
[8214.90s -> 8221.60s]  orange purple orange purple purple orange what does that mean what is that for it's the musical
[8221.60s -> 8234.58s]  notes take a look at this shit look at this look at that three three three one three fuck
[8237.06s -> 8265.01s]  never mind there's an extra one three three one three five there's too many one two three four
[8265.01s -> 8271.20s]  five six one two three four five six seven eight so where are these this is that one
[8271.84s -> 8284.56s]  and this is that one so these two are both six or something son who's what the fuck is happening
[8284.56s -> 8295.15s]  right now flutters just gave 30 subs 30 community subs from fluttered 30 20 from match looks 30
[8295.15s -> 8303.44s]  from flutters that's a thank you for the huge amount of community subs you guys are way too
[8303.44s -> 8309.47s]  generous thank you I was just about to rip this in half but then how would my grandkids ever
[8309.47s -> 8315.39s]  be able to finish it that's a lot thank you for the fucking huge amount of subs
[8315.95s -> 8326.59s]  and I'm gonna turn the brightness up so you guys can see because it's getting a little darker
[8326.59s -> 8354.70s]  outside there we go okay um it's something to do with the notes the musical notes but what
[8357.31s -> 8396.96s]  it's really washed out now I got you hold on better no better better better okay we got
[8397.92s -> 8404.94s]  these the timer is broken no because I went like this that this this whole this is meaningless
[8404.94s -> 8413.07s]  we're just using this for the machine portion all right hidden numbers I don't see anything
[8413.07s -> 8431.28s]  on here that's a hidden number I'm gonna have a magnifying glass but when what do I need
[8431.28s -> 8459.94s]  to get in this room 98 what's what hold on machine no code fuck two three four
[8460.90s -> 8482.99s]  well they're three three three five three three three five is that it did I get it
[8488.46s -> 8503.28s]  incorrect are you lacking no I don't think so three three how about three one
[8504.24s -> 8539.70s]  three one five well three three three six three three three three one five three one six five
[8540.66s -> 8554.16s]  three one six five let's see if that does it god what does this have anything on it
[8554.80s -> 8560.08s]  it's five look it's this one this one's purple it's purple it's the purple ones
[8560.08s -> 8562.88s]  whatever the purple ones are there's a little purple face on it can you see that
[8564.83s -> 8571.52s]  you can't but I trust me it's purple right here it's a little purple guy all right so
[8571.52s -> 8582.93s]  then it's three one four five three one five four because those aren't on there three one five
[8582.93s -> 8594.58s]  four that's really washed out but it's okay uh the laboratory contains a huge screen showing
[8594.58s -> 8600.26s]  a satellite image of the earth towards which a hundred missiles are pointing how can you
[8600.26s -> 8606.86s]  stop it yes look at the ceiling take card 36 he has a bunch of missiles pointed at earth
[8607.74s -> 8616.58s]  yeah usually in like these saturday morning kids cartoon villains they like
[8619.41s -> 8622.77s]  they don't they don't do anything like this usually it's something like
[8623.74s -> 8629.17s]  I stole the ice cream maker and now you'll never make ice cream again and no one will ever
[8629.17s -> 8634.85s]  be happy or like oh my like rainbow machine is I stole it this guy is trying to destroy
[8634.85s -> 8644.70s]  the fucking earth with missiles this doesn't happen okay so get rid of pretty much everything
[8644.70s -> 8651.86s]  we got one more really clever puzzle to do to get rid of this one get rid of nine thirty seven
[8651.86s -> 8661.42s]  fifty one nine thirty seven fifty one eighty eight fifty one is already gone
[8662.54s -> 8667.50s]  now it's not okay that leaves us with this why do I still have the kitchen and shit out here
[8668.22s -> 8673.18s]  all right let's get these in the good view here so we got this machine
[8674.40s -> 8681.58s]  a cage is hanging by a chain from the ceiling choose the right maneuver to get down push the
[8681.58s -> 8688.14s]  lever to the left take card g to do that or push the lever to the right take card d this
[8688.14s -> 8697.86s]  might be a death scenario so push the lever to the left or the lever to the right so if
[8697.86s -> 8709.54s]  I push the lever to the right that would mean we would be going this way so this way which
[8709.54s -> 8720.53s]  would make this purple one go this way which would make you know it's the same amount of
[8720.53s -> 8726.29s]  it's the same chance as roulette so I mean just put it on black or red uh I'm gonna
[8726.29s -> 8745.31s]  say put it on red we're gonna push it over to the right this way means it'll go this way
[8745.39s -> 8756.13s]  which will spin this this way which will move this one this way which will move this one
[8758.27s -> 8768.62s]  this way which will move this one this way which will move this one this way and it'll go down
[8769.58s -> 8796.86s]  we're taking card d it's to the right d here we go nothing in my hand right
[8797.50s -> 8806.78s]  nothing in my hand at all got nothing the cage slowly descends creaking it is closed by a coded
[8806.78s -> 8810.46s]  lock hurry to open it and press the button that will stop the destruction of the planet
[8811.26s -> 8819.46s]  I think that already happened see I don't know I haven't been outside in like fucking probably
[8819.46s -> 8823.62s]  four hours so I might just be in the bunker and the earth is probably gone
[8824.34s -> 8832.40s]  hurry to open it and press the button what do you mean how do I hurry up hurry hurry hurry
[8832.40s -> 8844.99s]  okay the cage slowly what's what's the code I see okay I see uh dash you see that on the bottom
[8844.99s -> 8851.34s]  of the cage there's a dash star dash dash dash star dash star dash dash dash star dash is that
[8851.34s -> 8868.06s]  morse code I'll show it to you look these the it's so fine it's hard to see it so one
[8870.59s -> 8880.85s]  hurry up and do it before the before the bomb explodes one one three one three one one three
[8880.85s -> 8894.46s]  one three one um congrats what do you mean congrats why is everybody saying good job
[8898.10s -> 8919.07s]  congrats oh the music okay um I'm like we're getting like gross lips right now the cage
[8919.07s -> 8928.77s]  slowly hurry up or the planet will be destroyed dash star dash one three one three
[8928.77s -> 8943.78s]  one one three one one one three one one what's that mean one one two three four and two
[8947.07s -> 8963.17s]  I don't know read it upside down dash no that doesn't do anything uh code I'm gonna say
[8963.89s -> 8975.26s]  all right we got move this out of the way um it's four digits so I don't fucking have any idea
[8975.26s -> 8992.82s]  what this the star this is two different numbers one three one three one three one
[8997.36s -> 9018.08s]  one four three one one four fucking everyone's dead by this point this cage makes you think
[9018.08s -> 9028.74s]  of a code with bars where do we usually find bar codes how the hell does that help me I know
[9032.86s -> 9069.02s]  look for the answer on am I really getting that'll be solid right now this is not even
[9069.02s -> 9094.91s]  the right box where's the bottom of the box there's a there's the barcode uh it is you
[9094.91s -> 9101.06s]  gotta be fucking kidding me it's this barcode on the bottom that's the actual barcode on the
[9101.06s -> 9107.46s]  box that I would have never figured that out in a million years I would have gave up I would
[9107.46s -> 9110.34s]  have had to quit I would think that I would have just started I would have started flipping
[9110.34s -> 9124.59s]  cards over the code is three five eight three what no no no no no no no no the code is
[9127.52s -> 9147.25s]  five eight zero six that's that's some metal gear solid shit right there press the button
[9147.25s -> 9152.05s]  and no sides evil device stops after releasing a few electrical flashes well done you have saved
[9152.05s -> 9176.77s]  the world that's all folks what about these other cards now that was not 112 minutes I
[9176.77s -> 9181.01s]  pressed the button a million times 60 minutes of added stuff I would it would have been three
[9181.01s -> 9192.64s]  stars I would have been I would have had a nice three stars on this I would have I pressed
[9192.64s -> 9198.06s]  the penalty button like 30 times what's with what's with the other cards what should we
[9198.06s -> 9209.33s]  reveal these I'm not gonna play this again no no oh these are all damn it like you these
[9209.33s -> 9215.71s]  are all you lose cards no yes of course yeah these are all like you failed I didn't see very
[9215.71s -> 9224.75s]  many of these so all right that's well that one's done that was uh the sausage one so let
[9224.75s -> 9236.42s]  me ask you this uh for this I got two more of these there's a time to transition uh there's
[9236.42s -> 9252.27s]  a time to transition to um a little bit of wine or should we put this away this no more
[9254.37s -> 9262.35s]  what you didn't let squeak in sausage you didn't like this it was fun I thought it was good

[9511.36s -> 9522.77s]  want me to do another one and drink I thought I thought it was gonna be a lot different
[9529.23s -> 9538.14s]  he was still I thought I don't know I thought that was like kind of interesting was hopefully
[9538.14s -> 9542.62s]  I was just trying to play it just to see I thought people maybe thought it was just
[9542.62s -> 9549.20s]  fun to hang out but if you all right add drink to both of them well if I do something else I'm
[9549.20s -> 9560.67s]  not gonna drink it I'm not gonna be on camera thank you cyanide for the $50 fuck the poll
[9560.67s -> 9570.94s]  play salmon max thank you with the 50 bucks no no no no I've got my fuck you table here
[9570.94s -> 9578.83s]  all right I'm gonna I'm gonna if I don't how about this I'm gonna do on the people have spoken
[9578.83s -> 9583.71s]  I can't go back on this poll I'm gonna drink and I'm gonna try to beat this I'm gonna do if I
[9583.71s -> 9594.00s]  don't if I actually don't do this in an hour then that's it and I'm moving on like I'm gonna
[9594.00s -> 9600.86s]  if I do not beat this within the timer that's it and we have to move on I'm gonna go I'm
[9600.86s -> 9614.19s]  really gonna try get really drunk and then gamble with Mario I'm not gonna get that drunk
[9614.19s -> 9620.82s]  all right let me grab let me grab something to drink that was a little trial run I know
[9620.82s -> 9635.62s]  what I'm doing now I think what do we think dinosaur or Wild West plus I did the tutorial
[9635.62s -> 9641.58s]  was like 20 minutes for that I had no idea what the hell I was doing Wild West or dinosaurs
[9641.58s -> 9649.78s]  I'm gonna say dinosaur this one apparently is hard this is the hardest one that I have
[9650.74s -> 9658.94s]  so I gotta fucking get this shit done in exactly one hour and for every penalty I have
[9658.94s -> 9673.14s]  to drink I'm just kidding I'm not doing that is this one ages 12 and up this one is is
[9673.14s -> 9677.76s]  still 10 and up all right I'm not gonna reveal the deck yet and hold on you know what I'm gonna
[9677.76s -> 9684.24s]  make this faster I'm gonna make this quick hold on all right let me go let me go let me get
[9684.24s -> 9690.74s]  hold on let me go get a drink let's get started here and I'm gonna I'm gonna blow you all away
[9690.74s -> 9802.11s]  I'll be right back all right I got something a little different here this is not uh this is
[9802.11s -> 9814.38s]  not the usual wine unfortunately guys I'm sorry to say I got something else Kim was Kim was
[9815.10s -> 9821.97s]  telling me what are you doing where you going with that I was like no I'm not going anywhere
[9822.53s -> 9842.96s]  hold on I've got uh some sake and my company is out of fucking business shot glass look at
[9842.96s -> 9869.31s]  that and my liquidated company shot glass rip machinima you're drinking liquid evil
[9869.31s -> 9881.30s]  why do you say that to drink with every card poll I am not gonna fucking do that
[9881.30s -> 9884.26s]  pull for which deck all right that's the hour you know if this is gonna be the one
[9885.31s -> 9889.63s]  this is the one then this uh that's a good idea we'll pull with the dinosaurs or wild
[9889.63s -> 9902.00s]  wild west I am already messing up my words this is the reason why anybody voted for this
[9902.00s -> 9908.72s]  hey you want to do another fucking card game no no no anything but that do anything else
[9908.72s -> 9921.47s]  I don't want to see this again hey I'm gonna be drinking okay all right that sounds great do
[9921.47s -> 9933.23s]  that all right let's do uh dinosaur or wild west you all right give me another poll because
[9933.23s -> 9943.86s]  that makes sense we should do it like that you only do boring shit drunk would you rather
[9943.86s -> 9958.66s]  I do exciting shit drunk no I I make this what what can I do exciting well what can I play
[9958.66s -> 9966.06s]  right now that's exciting drunk we I might just transition to it whatever it is I got one hour
[9966.06s -> 9969.34s]  all right guys which one do you want to see which deck this is important this is the last
[9969.34s -> 9976.40s]  time you're gonna see this you should play just dance um why would I ever turn that game on
[9978.16s -> 9992.13s]  why would I I don't want this to be biased hold on there you go for our entertainment
[9993.84s -> 9996.56s]  oh but for those of you that I've got some news for everybody here
[9997.84s -> 10003.41s]  this is people are gonna like this there's something that I told you about that I was
[10003.41s -> 10015.49s]  working on that is gonna happen now probably got a good lead there is a very interesting
[10015.49s -> 10020.83s]  stream coming up here in the next I don't know I actually got like a good lead on it
[10023.46s -> 10029.78s]  you'll see talked about it a few times and it's gonna be more elaborate than I think you think
[10030.34s -> 10033.78s]  I don't I think people think this is gonna be a little one and done little thing but just
[10033.78s -> 10052.78s]  just wait there could be way more on top of this dino it is we're gonna unlock the dino deck
[10054.08s -> 10057.60s]  and just because I wanted to be completely prepared for this I am completely prepared
[10057.60s -> 10064.64s]  for this I've got super Mario dinosaur music and I'm not going to waste any fucking time
[10065.20s -> 10073.46s]  so here comes dinosaur music I think it should be at least I've got my uh my sake
[10074.26s -> 10092.83s]  I've got my fucking liquidated company glass what the fuck unbelievable all right here we go
[10094.10s -> 10108.94s]  survival guide this should not read this professor challenger very different like
[10108.94s -> 10116.74s]  dinosaurs in here okay that might is this a guide that might be like an answer guide

[10224.64s -> 10239.50s]  um like the inside of a plastic bag with a hint of uh burnt mango something like that all
[10239.50s -> 10246.02s]  right are we ready I don't need to do the tutorial but keep the box though in case you
[10246.02s -> 10249.62s]  want to sit for 20 fucking minutes on a puzzle and not know what to do here we go
[10249.62s -> 10254.10s]  sealed what's all up my hands sealed in the package I didn't open this beforehand
[10254.10s -> 10257.38s]  I just everyone's like well what if he knows the puzzles before take a look you look
[10259.78s -> 10326.32s]  I didn't reseal this opening the seal on camera opening the seal on camera so you know okay so
[10326.32s -> 10331.73s]  the first thing I'm going to do here is I'm going to draw overdraw don't need the tutorial
[10331.73s -> 10346.72s]  I already know how to do this got it tutorial done are we ready yeah it's the same thing
[10346.72s -> 10351.76s]  it's office with the wire remember I also need to move this camera because it's in a stupid dumb
[10351.76s -> 10362.46s]  idiot place and it's going to be a problem for me so that's that's better what do you mean I'm
[10362.46s -> 10380.10s]  cheating is this your fucking card all right get this out of the way I'm ready to start
[10381.06s -> 10391.54s]  you guys can't read this but don't worry I'll read it to you okay get excited for
[10391.54s -> 10399.12s]  this one because this one is going to be top notch here we go no more fucking around
[10399.12s -> 10407.36s]  expedition challenger is this one we're doing here we are new theme it is a new theme um don't
[10407.36s -> 10419.55s]  fuck this up here we go ready I'm gonna beat this in 60 60 minutes sort the cards are we talking
[10419.55s -> 10452.85s]  about good idea very good idea they are they're already sorted there's no um there's no
[10452.85s -> 10465.30s]  letters it's already sorted a fucking million of these okay you ready a young woman knocks
[10465.30s -> 10473.49s]  at the door of your agency your private investigating agency sort by number that's
[10473.49s -> 10479.89s]  you know how long that's gonna take to do that I have to I'm not you want me to put every
[10479.89s -> 10485.41s]  single one of these in order we that would take like fucking 30 minutes what do you mean do it
[10485.41s -> 10491.68s]  no I'm not gonna sort it no I can't that's the part of the game that's I have to go
[10491.68s -> 10499.07s]  one I have to go one to a hundred I'm gonna throw I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking throw
[10499.07s -> 10503.90s]  them if you keep this up don't fuck with me I'll do it I'm just gonna whip them to the
[10503.90s -> 10512.45s]  back of my door don't do it don't make me do that I'm fucking gonna do it I see it if I see
[10512.45s -> 10519.17s]  one more of these you won't do it no I won't you're right that person thanks for saving the
[10519.17s -> 10528.66s]  stream all right here we go my name is Gladys Ungerton my friend Ned Malone has gone missing
[10529.22s -> 10533.95s]  you've probably heard about him he's one of the members of Professor Challenger's expedition
[10534.75s -> 10537.87s]  they recently returned from the lost valley full of strange creatures
[10538.59s -> 10543.95s]  I just received this notebook and this odd message and I don't understand a word of any of it can you
[10543.95s -> 10550.77s]  please go to the offices of Professor Challenger if you are true to your reputation you will
[10550.77s -> 10558.80s]  bring Ned back to me should you accept to help Gladys take the survival guide and card 53
[10558.80s -> 10581.49s]  I need that thing what did I throw it okay I need 53 and then launch the app and hit start
[10581.49s -> 10589.76s]  and then flip this card over when you start it so I need card 53 don't start that you don't
[10589.76s -> 10598.67s]  start the timer yet by the way if I do this in one hour and I actually get to the end in one
[10598.67s -> 10617.62s]  hour I want five thousand subs if I don't get to the end in an hour I want negative five
[10617.62s -> 10634.59s]  thousand subs so just kill my whole channel 53 I'm going all in on this one my big bits
[10634.59s -> 10643.89s]  came in cyanide another 50 dollars do it coward what do you think I'm doing okay I got my
[10643.89s -> 10671.31s]  survival guide I've got my 53 I'm not taking I'm just getting I'm getting it ready so don't
[10671.31s -> 10678.14s]  waste any time how many pauses am I allowed go if I get uh there a desk if we get a desk I got
[10678.14s -> 10690.69s]  a uh little light 53 53 okay I got a rock of I don't know what that means okay 36 36
[10690.69s -> 10702.24s]  15 36 8 42 15 36 8 42 15 36 8 42 15 36 8 42 13 38 42 48 4 42 45 45 36 38 38 35

[10714.80s -> 10728.48s]  this is what you do this is what you do 36 42 2 36 46 18 99 and 95 5 26 32 32
[10729.44s -> 10734.05s]  24 13 28 29 29
[10735.33s -> 10740.67s]  24 36 39 29 40 42 36 42 42 42
[10744.90s -> 10758.27s]  cane candle okay cane cane candle 15 was a painting painting painting
[10759.07s -> 10762.91s]  a book 1588 is inside the cupboard there is a book it's right here that's the book I need
[10762.91s -> 10766.75s]  to get into uh an edition of Alice in Wonderland it's impossible to open the book
[10766.75s -> 10769.63s]  as long as it bears this combination padlock so there's a combination padlock on it's going
[10769.95s -> 10776.35s]  to get a uh F and a C on it and one of them is cold F and C to 36 down here this is a
[10776.35s -> 10781.15s]  candle a candle and we got uh 42 is down above here it's a high quality shoe horn
[10782.11s -> 10785.39s]  okay so we got uh let's take a look at it we see if there's any hidden numbers here
[10786.03s -> 10811.79s]  nothing on there hidden numbers anything hydrate okay and they know the candle this
[10811.79s -> 10820.30s]  has a new book okay it's a code it's a padlock F and C Fahrenheit and Celsius
[10820.86s -> 10831.95s]  Fahrenheit and Celsius Fahrenheit Celsius cold uh thought and cold hot and cold cold C cold
[10831.95s -> 10863.15s]  survival guy cold C Celsius I think I'm stupid Fahrenheit Celsius three lines 15 and 10
[10864.03s -> 10877.70s]  50 10 code 50 10 ah it's 50 and 10 on
[10886.21s -> 10893.33s]  why what is it what's that mean 50 and 10 10 and 50 no it's Fahrenheit 1050
[10897.34s -> 10909.79s]  no no no no it's not 1050 it would be it would be no it's 50 10 I don't want to
[10909.79s -> 10923.97s]  lose any more time five fucking thousand subs around the line oh my god I just lost
[10923.97s -> 10954.98s]  fucking 10 whole minutes what's the wiggly line what's this painting 14 14 14 14 I'm
[10954.98s -> 10962.88s]  fucking doing I'm trying so hard 14 I can see 14 in the corner for the painting 16 80 99 25
[10963.76s -> 10979.87s]  give me who is fucking 14 what it's a uh a coconut behind the painting you find a strange
[10979.87s -> 10987.84s]  coconut coconut smash the coconut with it with the with the horn 42 okay a high quality shoe
[10987.84s -> 11000.82s]  horn smashed the coconut 42 plus 14 is 42 52 56 it's right on top 56 is right on top
[11001.62s -> 11008.80s]  smash the coconut I am so fucking I'm on top of this right now I ain't gonna lose
[11010.14s -> 11015.86s]  I need to discard pile up here the coconut opens in the middle it holds a mysterious machine
[11017.60s -> 11028.19s]  latitude longitude what is that 56 machine 56 enter destination latitude no longitude no
[11028.19s -> 11040.43s]  I need a map a map that's uh I need latitude and longitude all right I gotta get a map I gotta
[11040.43s -> 11048.16s]  find a map okay okay got a candle this painting still okay I don't I don't have it I got
[11048.16s -> 11064.42s]  nothing for that what how do I get in this fucking book was it supposed to 36 15 thought
[11064.42s -> 11076.83s]  of getting a fucking book f and c f I don't know how to get in the book I don't know what this
[11076.83s -> 11090.56s]  even means I know it's Fahrenheit and Celsius but there's nothing no other information on
[11090.56s -> 11100.69s]  this book to give me any leads I it's like not 50 and 10 so what the hell is it Fahrenheit
[11100.69s -> 11108.34s]  Celsius I got no longitude I got no latitude I've got a painting but there's nothing on that
[11108.34s -> 11130.72s]  painting I got this weird scissors rock paper scissors lemons can I burn these two oh 50 60
[11130.72s -> 11171.87s]  70 80 86 87 89 burn the burn it now come on come on 89 89 89 89 89 89 80 88 87 89 what 36
[11176.16s -> 11182.48s]  all right what the fuck after just okay discard 36 and 53 get rid of these I just didn't okay
[11182.48s -> 11192.86s]  discard what the fuck does this even say woods in the form of our voyage and a few of natural
[11192.86s -> 11199.50s]  history and g-toe could of interest to the general public help enter both latitude and
[11199.50s -> 11210.10s]  longitude rates by teleporter to our the five of us we are in great danger ned each coordinate
[11210.10s -> 11221.70s]  is made of a car followed by two I will nobody can read that each there's more of this I'll
[11221.70s -> 11237.58s]  help you with the it is for minute uh each coordinate is made of a car followed by two
[11237.58s -> 11244.78s]  I will help you with the it is the four minutes and look on the lower right side for the other
[11244.78s -> 11271.41s]  row beat the and enter challengers initials lower right side of what of the car look on
[11271.41s -> 11282.32s]  the lower right side of the car I have to get into this book Fahrenheit Celsius it's 50 and
[11282.32s -> 11297.95s]  then this is 10 but then there's that weird little symbol that's flying around what is
[11297.95s -> 11341.15s]  that symbol is there like a squiggly latitude no that's not it it's his initials and then
[11341.15s -> 11359.22s]  something I'd have no idea enter both latitude and longitude rates be teleported to our
[11360.10s -> 11370.66s]  the five of us we are in great danger hey what the rock n rock e scissor w paper
[11371.30s -> 11413.33s]  fuck does this even mean dot dot dash dot dash dot dash dot is it f and c on here
[11413.33s -> 11424.59s]  yeah but that's just morse code but how but that I need to translate that into four digits
[11432.00s -> 11458.45s]  50 10 I tried 50 10 earlier it didn't do anything this is fucking bogus this painting
[11458.45s -> 11472.48s]  is Japanese but what I don't have that information in my book how the fuck you
[11472.48s -> 11481.52s]  supposed to do this in 60 seconds I mean very clearly f and c are right here why would it be
[11481.52s -> 11505.49s]  f and c with that the the squiggles around it these are just the dinosaurs as in there's no
[11505.49s -> 11524.82s]  squiggly lines you see squiggly lines on here I don't it seems g e challenger is his initials
[11524.82s -> 11538.08s]  so it's g e 50 10 wait there was there was squiggly where were that where were we talking
[11538.08s -> 11548.34s]  about where what are you talking about what do you see them I don't see them what I mean
[11548.34s -> 11564.72s]  right there where do you see these no you're lying to me there's nothing here I'm I there's
[11564.72s -> 11576.91s]  nothing on this map that has squiggly lines on it I can't even get the fuck out of this first puzzle
[11576.91s -> 11601.68s]  wait wait wait wait is there f and c here g e but then I need the longitude and latitude
[11601.68s -> 11611.62s]  but it's a rock and paper scissor f c but is the the wave the is this the wave the painting
[11611.62s -> 11641.06s]  14 c is 14 no what the fuck there's no and no there's no lettered cards c is in blue is
[11641.06s -> 11645.84s]  for celsius f is for fahrenheit so what the fuck are you talking about game
[11649.15s -> 11662.50s]  f is clearly on 50 c is very clearly on 10 50 10 how does this make no sense I tried that already
[11662.50s -> 11680.43s]  g e 50 10 on this on this dumb machine no but this is like latitude latitude north
[11681.47s -> 11686.93s]  look scissors this doesn't make any sense this makes no sense
[11689.54s -> 11699.20s]  you I've rock paper scissor and then 50 and 10 is this like element shit
[11702.94s -> 11751.39s]  rock is north but what is rock sees north rock east scissor no fucking idea like like zero
[11751.39s -> 11757.22s]  idea what the hell they want me to do there's no way I'm gonna do this I'm gonna okay minus
[11757.22s -> 11766.13s]  five fucking thousand subs this is the it's not possible what the fuck are you talking
[11766.13s -> 11776.11s]  about okay let me tell you how dumb this is okay the apparently the red number is for
[11776.11s -> 11791.18s]  boiling temperature why would I ever ever ever ever ever think that how would I what information
[11791.18s -> 11809.90s]  is here boiling temperature what I'm gonna boil the card so it's two oh but boiling in
[11809.90s -> 11817.94s]  fahrenheit is was what two two twelve so two twelve and then the celsius is just what for
[11817.94s -> 11826.00s]  freezing which is zero two one two zero what a dumb fucking thing well yeah by the way that
[11826.00s -> 11831.44s]  means it's boiling now if you didn't catch that this game owes me five thousand subs
[11832.24s -> 11852.37s]  it's not over five take the card five padlock opens five a number is at the bottom of the
[11852.37s -> 11855.97s]  book page oh there's a really there is yep thank you for that I just I didn't I didn't
[11855.97s -> 11863.71s]  press that it scared me okay there we go 36 minutes I can do it discard how am I supposed
[11863.71s -> 11868.88s]  to read the book is open it's a it's it says 34 and there's a I'm not supposed to read that
[11868.88s -> 11896.08s]  okay it's a bunny and a lady 34 come on come on please I'm fighting for my life here 34
[11896.08s -> 11906.61s]  look at how do you see how much text is on this this volume holds in the form of a diary
[11906.61s -> 11910.85s]  the account of our voyage and a few short remarks about natural history in geology
[11910.85s -> 11915.41s]  that I believe could be of interest to the general public we needed to study the lands
[11915.41s -> 11921.09s]  and follow the right coordinates left behind by the previous explorer so to confirm whether or
[11921.09s -> 11925.57s]  not there was a hidden valley in which huge animals hid and needed to be saved from the
[11925.57s -> 11933.12s]  desert people who killed them out of fear we also wanted to check on the coordinate pointing
[11933.12s -> 11940.22s]  to a bird called the red cardinal presumably living on the highest point we were missing
[11940.22s -> 11946.06s]  several of the digits and therefore we couldn't find the latitude we went as far this is a joke
[11946.78s -> 11956.77s]  the text gets smaller they couldn't fit it so they shrunk it we had planned to we went as
[11956.77s -> 11961.17s]  far as we could to the south we had planned to stay but after a few seconds we were attacked
[11961.17s -> 11984.61s]  by a very big dinosaur and chased by an even bigger rabbit there's like lines going through
[11984.61s -> 12011.84s]  this l c d g the line is what disaster there's clearly a line here going through
[12012.56s -> 12030.38s]  they're supposed to do this in an hour no way more like two or three i have to read
[12030.38s -> 12049.65s]  this whole essay again hold on does this even mean cardinals check on the coordinate
[12049.65s -> 12080.43s]  pointing to a bird the red cardinal i want to see a dinosaur i got no fucking idea
[12080.43s -> 12090.34s]  bird called the red cardinal presumably living on the highest point we were missing several of
[12090.34s -> 12098.77s]  the digits and therefore we couldn't find the latitude we went as far as we could to the south
[12098.77s -> 12102.21s]  we had planned to stay but after a few seconds we were attacked by a dinosaur
[12102.77s -> 12135.90s]  camp i'm gonna smash the table this is like so convoluted i need magnifying glasses to read
[12135.90s -> 12194.54s]  this camp for stream central lake there's no bird on here rapid and a lady none of this
[12194.54s -> 12202.70s]  makes any sense to me just give me a hint i don't i don't even understand the rabbit has a strange
[12202.70s -> 12228.88s]  posture what is it playing at what is supposed to be like a constellation rock he's doing rock
[12231.06s -> 12250.24s]  but but who cares he's doing rock north rabbit north north rock north is she doing paper
[12261.31s -> 12270.96s]  north but what does the rabbit even mean is it like a rabbit up north a rabbit named anything
[12271.60s -> 12302.00s]  i don't even have this still up here have i tried solving the puzzle i'm returning this one this
[12302.00s -> 12322.29s]  one doesn't count no this one don't count it's like it's like you got to find like this one
[12322.29s -> 12328.94s]  little thing how did you not know that the f was talking about boiling water you're supposed
[12328.94s -> 12332.54s]  to know that the rabbit was pointing to a rock which was the cardinal which the cardinal
[12333.50s -> 12349.09s]  oh give me a break but i dude your driving exam your driver's ed exam has text bigger than this
[12349.73s -> 12364.06s]  when you put your eyes in the fucking microscope thing when you do like the test to see if you
[12364.06s -> 12371.70s]  need glasses for like the driving exam they're bigger than this so thankfully i don't need
[12371.70s -> 12390.45s]  glasses to operate a car we went as far south as we i rock north rabbit i don't know rabbit
[12390.45s -> 12402.56s]  north rock but what is rock rock is rock on here coconut painting doesn't do anything
[12404.38s -> 12433.26s]  they've hidden numbers 34 we already have 34 34 anything on the cardinal how is this ages 10
[12433.26s -> 12444.11s]  plus no no you got helped by like four adults you're not doing this at 10 plus you can't even
[12444.11s -> 12452.56s]  fucking read at 10 you can't read at 10 years old age is 10 enough no that's like
[12452.56s -> 12469.90s]  the fucking esrb rating there's no blood in this game no idea i'm just give me the

[12597.68s -> 12601.68s]  will have the opportunity to find and save the other members of the expedition their health
[12601.68s -> 12609.18s]  deteriorates every night use the app to indicate your movements and take the shown cards to
[12609.18s -> 12618.45s]  reconstitute the map to interact with a card with an anchor you must be on its space
[12619.09s -> 12624.21s]  the other objects are transported with you good luck and be careful now take card 81 it's
[12624.21s -> 12649.01s]  the first part of the map 81 the air is humid and stuffy so we got the tent and then the ground
[12649.01s -> 12682.56s]  so 93 45 did i go by 93 already am i is the timer still on 93 and 45 you got an empty bottle

[12742.69s -> 12753.42s]  there's a pterodactyl here uh let's uh four i guess we're gonna see what the pterodactyl
[12753.42s -> 12758.62s]  does can we tame the pterodactyl this strange creature is playing with a rope
[12760.26s -> 12765.15s]  empty bottle and rope there's also an anchor though what's the anchor mean again
[12765.87s -> 12776.40s]  you must be on its space okay you have to be i have to be on the anchor space to use that
[12778.93s -> 12786.22s]  so i have to be here can i do rope and bottle what would that what would that even do
[12786.86s -> 12809.50s]  well let's do 26 a torch chalk bottle torch pterodactyl uh the torch is not
