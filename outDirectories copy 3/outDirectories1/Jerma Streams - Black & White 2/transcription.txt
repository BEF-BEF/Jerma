[0.70s -> 9.83s]  And the word milk. That's gonna be kind of hard considering that there will be a cow on stream
[9.83s -> 21.16s]  for the next... up to two hours I think. I'm just getting high guys. How you doing? Good afternoon.
[21.16s -> 32.90s]  I love doing the up to certain amount of time for streams because it could be anything. Yeah,
[32.90s -> 41.29s]  this one's gonna be up to eight hours. That could be 20 minutes. 20 minutes or eight hours. Pick one.
[41.29s -> 51.43s]  Yeah, we're gonna do black and white too today. It's running. It's in 1080p and it looks glorious.
[51.43s -> 62.25s]  I'm also trialing out a new brace. I've got Boomer Brace 2.0. It's a little different. I'm
[62.25s -> 71.10s]  just... you gotta get used to it. Might need to loosen it a little bit. It's been upgraded
[71.10s -> 79.83s]  and eventually we're gonna upgrade until I'm Dr. Octopus. But yeah, we're gonna... we can
[79.83s -> 83.43s]  get started here in a second. Let me just make sure the tweet went through. We can get started
[83.43s -> 159.50s]  in about a minute, two minutes. You're back. Okay. Are we ready? Are we ready to begin?
[160.46s -> 173.94s]  Black and white 2. There we go. Now spoilers. No, no, no spoilers. No spoilers. All right. Let's get
[173.94s -> 183.56s]  out of this. I don't want to know what's possible. I want to get in here blind. This is black and
[183.56s -> 189.08s]  white 2. I just loaded it to check out to make sure it could get captured well and that it was
[189.08s -> 196.30s]  in 1080 fucking pretty, dude. And it is. I got all the fan patches to make sure the game runs.
[197.10s -> 207.14s]  Let's hope we got a good case here. New game. Let's go. Are you guys ready for the Moo Crew?
[237.42s -> 246.57s]  I'm a meteor that's about to crash into Earth.
[256.47s -> 264.31s]  I'm coming. I've answered your prayers. We're back on God Island like last game.
[264.87s -> 271.11s]  We're your conscience. We're part of you. Looks way better than the last one. You'll be the God
[271.11s -> 278.23s]  you want to be. So we'll guide you as you make your godly way through whatever this world
[278.23s -> 284.47s]  throws. But before then, you'll want to learn the big. We'll help you with all that. But even more
[284.47s -> 291.03s]  importantly, you'll need a creature. Yes. Let's go and choose one. Who is it going to be? What do
[291.03s -> 301.62s]  you guys think? Who's it going to be? I wonder. There they are. Wonderful, aren't they? You have
[301.62s -> 308.66s]  four to choose from, but the one you choose will be with you throughout your whole time in this
[308.66s -> 315.62s]  world. So consider carefully. Monkey? No. Make your choice wisely. Absolutely not. We'll tell you
[315.62s -> 322.42s]  about these amazing beasts. All creatures can be trained to become lovable mischievous
[322.42s -> 329.78s]  pets. Or they can be the ultimate disciplined weapons of destruction and war. Look at Varian.
[331.22s -> 338.18s]  He's just so curious. Can become these things. That's the wonder of a god's creature.
[338.18s -> 340.90s]  Don't stop zooming in on the monkey. I want to see them. I want to see them.
[341.70s -> 347.70s]  All creatures will grow up to be huge and powerful. They can be cute,
[347.70s -> 354.58s]  quirky pets, inquisitive and fun. The graphics is so much better. They can be single-minded
[354.58s -> 358.50s]  war machines. Can I see what the other ones look like when they get older?
[359.14s -> 363.62s]  All creatures will be as good or evil as you teach them to be.
[364.42s -> 375.50s]  Now snooze. Boring. Snore. Snore. Yeah, right. I'd rather they spread love in
[375.50s -> 381.34s]  the form of a massacre or two. By going into battle, creatures can live for war,
[381.34s -> 389.26s]  domination and destruction. Such a shame if you ask me. No, I don't know. Now this is what I'm
[389.26s -> 399.58s]  talking about right here. I love them. Oh, he did it. They all have their own lives,
[399.58s -> 405.02s]  but you need to be a responsible parent and not overfeed them. Oh, he's barfed to the shit. Yep,
[405.02s -> 410.62s]  gotta be the cow. Cow's the best animal. Now it's time to choose. He did a book of eight. I
[410.62s -> 416.04s]  thought you'd know he's perfect. That might be a little loud. Let me turn it down. It's a little
[416.04s -> 425.90s]  too loud, isn't it? All right, so hold on. It's a little loud. Yeah, it's maxed out. Let's go like,
[427.27s -> 437.94s]  bring it down a tad. Okay. Yes. All right. Let's see. Let's give them all a chance,
[437.94s -> 445.86s]  but we already know what our vote is. What's wrong with this one? Why was this one just sad?
[445.86s -> 454.74s]  Oh, look at him. Wait, is he gonna pick me? Remember me from last game? I was so funny.
[455.30s -> 460.52s]  Oh, he looks unsure. I have never been so sure of anything in my whole life.
[475.72s -> 478.52s]  That was awesome. Why is everybody so sad?
[478.52s -> 495.58s]  It's a baby. What? What was that? You know, let's, let's just do it.
[507.58s -> 510.14s]  Yeah, it's different. There's like, there's different shit here.
[511.10s -> 516.06s]  Yeah, I'm gonna do it. This is different than last year for manipulating the world.
[516.06s -> 523.58s]  It's not just drag buttons. Your view around the world like this. And why is your frame rating
[523.58s -> 529.34s]  when you do it? Hold down. Yes. All right. So it's right. Click this time to the right.
[530.86s -> 535.22s]  Just carry on dragging. Hold right. Okay. That was gonna say that didn't work.
[536.18s -> 547.78s]  Great work. Now we must move to our right. To move right, hold down the movement button,
[547.78s -> 554.82s]  then drag the mouse to the left. Bad PC. Wonderful. Just follow the arrows.
[554.82s -> 557.46s]  It's a lot better looking than black and white one for sure.
[560.34s -> 566.74s]  One hop this time. One hop this time. Two hops this time. That's pretty good.
[566.74s -> 576.02s]  I don't have a bad PC. You have a bad PC. Let's keep going. Click and hold the ground.
[576.66s -> 583.22s]  Then move the mouse back to pull yourself forwards. Follow the arrows to get back to your
[583.22s -> 586.42s]  creature. Excuse me. Hold on. It's just taking. Wait, there were a couple of winks that came in.
[587.54s -> 594.44s]  What do you think about fucking boomer brace 2.0? This has got, this has got fucking titanium in
[594.44s -> 600.28s]  the middle. There's steel in here. What do you think about boomer brace fucking 2.0 guy?
[601.64s -> 613.86s]  He's pretty good. Oh yeah. He's bulletproof. He's bulletproof.
[617.50s -> 623.82s]  Super villain. I know. And whilst keeping the movement button down, drag the mouse back.
[625.66s -> 634.58s]  Isn't that? That's what I'm doing. Game. Hold. Pull. That's what I'm doing. Hold. Pull. Hold. Pull.
[635.22s -> 638.26s]  Hold. Right click. Pull. What? Why is this? It's kind of finicky.
[638.98s -> 646.58s]  Now why is it working now? Weird. My fucking whatever. The creature is moving behind us.
[646.58s -> 653.70s]  We must pan backwards to find him. All right. Pan. Yep. That's working fine now.
[654.66s -> 666.73s]  I love that run. Look at his legs. Well done. Evil German. Whatever. I know this looks like
[666.73s -> 671.85s]  an evil villain origin story. It's going to keep going until I have my whole head is made out of
[671.85s -> 682.02s]  metal. Now we shall learn to rotate your view. Hold the middle mouse button down and drag from
[682.10s -> 688.34s]  side to side to rotate your view. Yeah. Last time it wasn't that.
[690.02s -> 694.98s]  Click and hold in the highlighted area. Who cares? I'm doing it correct.
[696.57s -> 701.37s]  Now whilst keeping the middle mouse button down, drag the mouse left.
[701.69s -> 716.09s]  Click and hold the middle mouse button in the highlighted area.
[719.69s -> 723.61s]  I was in there. Click and hold in the highlighted area.
[723.61s -> 725.85s]  You didn't even click in the right spot.
[726.09s -> 730.57s]  Lovely. Keep the middle. This is going very well. Now.
[733.77s -> 738.09s]  Click the middle mouse button in the highlighted area and hold it down.
[739.69s -> 744.25s]  Now whilst keeping the middle mouse button down, push the mouse forward.
[744.25s -> 748.89s]  I just want to hug Murius. What's wrong with Murius?
[749.69s -> 754.73s]  There is one last thing, Leader. Learning to zoom in and out.
[755.69s -> 763.05s]  He's doing like a depressed dance. What? What's with the depressed dance?
[763.85s -> 764.89s]  Holy shit, that was bad.
[764.89s -> 772.34s]  Now try zooming towards the creature. Excellent work. Wonderful. You showed remarkable skill,
[772.34s -> 777.70s]  Leader. Way to go, boys. Sorry I couldn't help but you know places to be.
[778.26s -> 782.90s]  All the controls you just learned can be used to move around the world.
[783.86s -> 791.35s]  Can you please say it, Leader? Sure.
[791.35s -> 795.35s]  This is a gold scroll. These lead you through the story.
[799.82s -> 802.86s]  Silver scrolls lead the closest in the world.
[804.30s -> 805.74s]  Is this the wink? Fuck.
[806.38s -> 811.77s]  Bronze scrolls are tutorials which can teach you so much.
[811.77s -> 815.93s]  Double click the movement button on the ground there to zoom to it quickly.
[820.36s -> 821.96s]  That's actually a really good feature to know.
[821.96s -> 823.48s]  I've seen bronze tutorial scroll here, boys.
[823.48s -> 825.72s]  That's a good feature to know.
[828.34s -> 833.86s]  Move the hand over the rock and hold down the action button to pick it up.
[833.86s -> 836.50s]  Once you've got hold of it, release the button.
[837.86s -> 840.98s]  So let's move all these rocks out of the circle.
[840.98s -> 843.94s]  Was it in the original game? I don't remember.
[843.94s -> 847.30s]  Oh, that's it. You picked up the rock like an expert.
[847.30s -> 848.10s]  This is different though.
[848.10s -> 852.90s]  Now move it outside the circle and click the action button again to drop it on the ground.
[852.90s -> 854.90s]  It used to be you had to hold and then let go.
[854.90s -> 856.10s]  Now I have to let go.
[856.10s -> 858.66s]  You've fooled it beautifully. Well done.
[858.66s -> 860.90s]  Reminds me of my cricketing days.
[862.10s -> 862.98s]  Yeah, this is a little different.
[863.62s -> 865.82s]  Watch out!
[869.19s -> 874.07s]  You have received 1,000 tribute and you thoroughly deserve it.
[878.58s -> 879.38s]  Tribute is good.
[879.38s -> 883.94s]  Another bronze scroll. So much to learn and so little time.
[887.98s -> 891.58s]  You know, virgins are wonderfully versatile.
[891.58s -> 894.22s]  They can do so much in the world.
[894.22s -> 899.74s]  You can simply pick up a villager and put him or her next to something.
[899.74s -> 905.42s]  The villager will take this as divine inspiration and become a disciple.
[905.42s -> 906.22s]  Hype train game.
[907.50s -> 909.02s]  Hype train game. What's that? A hype train?
[910.14s -> 910.70s]  Holy shit.
[916.57s -> 917.93s]  Yeah, you used to have to click and hold.
[917.93s -> 919.05s]  Now you just click once.
[919.85s -> 921.21s]  Disciple farmer.
[922.17s -> 925.29s]  This person is safely working at the farm.
[928.89s -> 930.33s]  Don't look, leader.
[930.33s -> 934.41s]  The breeders are doing whatever it is such people do.
[934.41s -> 935.05s]  What does it look like?
[939.82s -> 941.18s]  Builder, breeders, farmers.
[941.18s -> 943.18s]  You see, we got a builder.
[947.72s -> 948.68s]  Well, you don't need that.
[948.68s -> 949.08s]  It's fine.
[949.08s -> 949.56s]  What about you?
[951.06s -> 951.62s]  Forrester.
[951.78s -> 953.86s]  Disciple forrester.
[953.86s -> 957.30s]  And this guy is chopping trees for wood.
[957.30s -> 958.98s]  You got all that, boss?
[958.98s -> 959.48s]  I do.
[960.26s -> 964.26s]  And to prove it, there's a thousand tributes waiting for you.
[965.22s -> 967.30s]  Why not explore the land?
[967.30s -> 970.02s]  Click on the silver scrolls when you see them.
[970.02s -> 972.98s]  Click on the gold scroll on the big mountain to leave.
[973.70s -> 974.98s]  All right. Tutorial done.
[976.71s -> 977.19s]  I get it.
[977.19s -> 979.43s]  Is there any new information that I need to know that's not in this?
[979.59s -> 982.87s]  Uh, no, that was like a little refresher course.
[983.43s -> 987.62s]  Oh, this is scrolling my chat.
[989.16s -> 990.76s]  Oh, that's not good.
[990.76s -> 992.79s]  That's not good at all.
[992.79s -> 997.66s]  Actually, uh, might have to, um, I can't see chat now.
[997.66s -> 998.46s]  Uh-oh, hold on.
[1000.46s -> 1005.10s]  Um, might have to open up the third party program here to see you guys.
[1006.39s -> 1007.27s]  Might have to open up.
[1007.27s -> 1008.39s]  What about another window?
[1009.11s -> 1010.55s]  I'm gonna have to open up on a phone.
[1011.11s -> 1013.16s]  Let's see.
[1018.10s -> 1018.58s]  Okay.
[1018.58s -> 1019.86s]  Yeah, I can do it like this.
[1019.86s -> 1020.42s]  This is fine.
[1020.82s -> 1021.06s]  All right.
[1021.06s -> 1021.38s]  We're good.
[1021.94s -> 1023.14s]  I got you in a new window.
[1025.78s -> 1026.02s]  All right.
[1026.02s -> 1028.10s]  So let's do, um, what's the side quest?
[1033.45s -> 1038.09s]  If there is a God up there and you can hear me, please help me out.
[1038.09s -> 1041.21s]  I mean, my life is in ruins.
[1041.85s -> 1044.57s]  A rock has rolled onto my lovely garden.
[1044.57s -> 1048.57s]  I've been trying to move it, but it's too big and heavy.
[1048.57s -> 1050.81s]  If ever a man needs a God, I'm him.
[1051.45s -> 1052.89s]  Please hear my prayer.
[1053.85s -> 1059.34s]  Who's he to ask us to move a rock for him?
[1060.30s -> 1062.14s]  Let's teach him a lesson.
[1062.14s -> 1064.06s]  No, no, that's wrong.
[1064.94s -> 1066.78s]  A knockdown is like laundry.
[1066.78s -> 1067.82s]  Nothing without them.
[1068.86s -> 1069.82s]  There's a lot.
[1069.82s -> 1070.14s]  All right.
[1070.14s -> 1070.86s]  You, all right.
[1070.86s -> 1072.62s]  You, you got lucky today.
[1072.62s -> 1075.10s]  I, you'll, I just, you got saved by the laundry.
[1077.85s -> 1078.89s]  The rock is gone.
[1079.53s -> 1081.05s]  My garden is rockless.
[1081.77s -> 1082.73s]  Marvelous.
[1082.73s -> 1083.93s]  You moved the rock.
[1084.49s -> 1086.97s]  The man is happy and all is well.
[1086.97s -> 1090.25s]  Oh, is this how it's going to be, boss?
[1090.25s -> 1093.05s]  Win in the hearts of this world's people.
[1096.81s -> 1098.33s]  You've just received.
[1098.33s -> 1099.37s]  Why is the tree bowing?
[1101.19s -> 1101.67s]  Oh, okay.
[1102.39s -> 1102.71s]  Nice.
[1102.71s -> 1102.95s]  All right.
[1102.95s -> 1104.47s]  So we got some tribute there.
[1104.47s -> 1105.91s]  Let's just keep, let's keep moving around.
[1107.45s -> 1108.73s]  Need some more side quests.
[1109.69s -> 1112.73s]  It's a lot smoother than the last game too.
[1112.73s -> 1113.69s]  Wait, is this, let me guess.
[1114.33s -> 1116.49s]  Is this going to be throw a rock over here?
[1117.21s -> 1118.57s]  A silver scroll.
[1121.99s -> 1123.59s]  The waterfall is blocked.
[1126.58s -> 1127.78s]  What will we do now?
[1128.58s -> 1129.94s]  This is awful.
[1129.94s -> 1130.58s]  Don't worry.
[1131.22s -> 1132.66s]  We'll think of something.
[1132.66s -> 1134.66s]  What about the animals that built this dam?
[1135.38s -> 1136.34s]  What about the beavers?
[1136.34s -> 1140.42s]  Objects can prove very useful in both defense and attack.
[1140.42s -> 1142.10s]  Tools through an object.
[1142.10s -> 1143.62s]  First, pick it up.
[1143.62s -> 1145.54s]  Then, whilst keeping the action.
[1145.54s -> 1147.94s]  What if I remove the rock beavers?
[1147.94s -> 1150.26s]  In the direction you want to throw.
[1150.26s -> 1152.90s]  Release the button when you want to let go of the object.
[1152.90s -> 1154.02s]  Same tutorial.
[1154.02s -> 1154.90s]  Oh, mega lull.
[1156.58s -> 1157.38s]  Rock beavers.
[1162.49s -> 1207.82s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, all right.
[1207.82s -> 1209.10s]  It's too much or too little.
[1209.10s -> 1209.82s]  What the fuck?
[1211.58s -> 1212.38s]  What the fuck?
[1215.54s -> 1216.90s]  Oh my, okay.
[1216.90s -> 1217.38s]  Come on.
[1227.00s -> 1227.72s]  Jesus.
[1227.72s -> 1228.04s]  What?
[1231.46s -> 1233.03s]  I don't even need to die.
[1233.03s -> 1233.83s]  That's hard.
[1233.83s -> 1234.63s]  That's really hard.
[1236.63s -> 1237.27s]  Well done.
[1237.27s -> 1239.80s]  Lockage has been cleared.
[1245.66s -> 1246.54s]  Try another.
[1246.54s -> 1247.18s]  Nice shooting.
[1248.06s -> 1248.62s]  Oh, fun.
[1253.50s -> 1254.62s]  I'm so excited.
[1254.62s -> 1256.14s]  I can't tell you how excited I am.
[1256.78s -> 1259.82s]  I can't wait for Murius to grow into a full grown cow.
[1260.70s -> 1262.78s]  And point to the point and go.
[1263.98s -> 1265.02s]  That's my favorite.
[1265.02s -> 1265.74s]  That's all I care about.
[1272.57s -> 1275.37s]  We could help their friends by moving them.
[1275.45s -> 1278.33s]  So they can be together in the main valley.
[1278.97s -> 1279.29s]  Okay.
[1282.87s -> 1284.15s]  Isn't that sweet?
[1284.71s -> 1286.79s]  A little lost valley of people.
[1288.97s -> 1290.81s]  Where do we put them?
[1290.81s -> 1292.62s]  You hold the nun.
[1292.62s -> 1293.02s]  We're here.
[1295.10s -> 1295.74s]  Great.
[1295.74s -> 1296.30s]  Welcome home.
[1296.30s -> 1298.54s]  The nomad is in the right valley.
[1303.53s -> 1304.03s]  Good.
[1315.54s -> 1317.99s]  This is unethical.
[1319.67s -> 1320.71s]  Oh, is this unethical?
[1321.59s -> 1323.75s]  I'm doing like a nice thing.
[1325.27s -> 1326.39s]  I'll show you unethical.
[1326.39s -> 1327.59s]  Would you like to see unethical?
[1338.39s -> 1339.75s]  Next time, walk on your own.
[1342.66s -> 1346.28s]  I mean, is that unethical?
[1346.28s -> 1348.92s]  Or is it mean?
[1348.92s -> 1350.60s]  You rescued everyone.
[1351.32s -> 1355.16s]  Look, you received 1,000 tribute.
[1355.16s -> 1356.36s]  Why are they punching each other?
[1358.07s -> 1358.57s]  You stink.
[1359.59s -> 1362.07s]  The land is complete, leader.
[1362.07s -> 1365.91s]  Click the gold scroll on top of the mountain to regress.
[1365.91s -> 1366.47s]  Here we go.
[1368.79s -> 1370.39s]  We're going to the top of the mountain.
[1370.95s -> 1372.74s]  It's time for Murius.
[1372.74s -> 1375.94s]  This is where Murius has to go do his fucking shaman quest.
[1375.94s -> 1378.02s]  To go get chain lightning.
[1378.02s -> 1380.98s]  Are you sure you wish to leave the land?
[1380.98s -> 1382.50s]  Click again to confirm.
[1391.91s -> 1393.11s]  We got a little refresher.
[1393.11s -> 1394.87s]  They didn't expect that.
[1394.87s -> 1396.55s]  Split one, villager.
[1398.42s -> 1400.66s]  Now you've had a taste of your powers.
[1400.74s -> 1403.38s]  We're ready to visit our mighty Greek capital.
[1403.38s -> 1404.02s]  Yeah.
[1404.02s -> 1406.58s]  Full of people that worship us.
[1410.39s -> 1410.89s]  What?
[1410.89s -> 1412.15s]  Please hear us.
[1412.15s -> 1412.79s]  Can you hear them?
[1412.79s -> 1413.75s]  Please help us.
[1413.75s -> 1415.43s]  That's a pure prayer.
[1416.55s -> 1417.19s]  That's weird.
[1417.19s -> 1419.11s]  It sounds like something terrible has happened.
[1419.11s -> 1419.75s]  Worship.
[1420.87s -> 1424.31s]  Mighty one, please heed up.
[1424.31s -> 1428.39s]  Our armies are crushed.
[1428.39s -> 1432.71s]  What's left of us hides in this city from the brutal Aztecs.
[1432.71s -> 1434.95s]  And now they are at our walls.
[1434.95s -> 1437.75s]  I implore you, please help us.
[1438.79s -> 1440.23s]  Oh, that's a lot of people.
[1440.23s -> 1440.79s]  Wait, what?
[1442.82s -> 1444.58s]  That's like 5,000 people.
[1445.54s -> 1450.96s]  Wait, damn.
[1450.96s -> 1452.70s]  Our city is under siege.
[1454.36s -> 1456.12s]  Killed nearly all our troops.
[1456.12s -> 1457.00s]  What am I supposed to do?
[1457.00s -> 1458.84s]  You're all going to die.
[1458.84s -> 1461.82s]  Look at the pig.
[1461.82s -> 1463.10s]  The pig just sitting there.
[1463.66s -> 1464.54s]  Save the villagers.
[1464.54s -> 1466.06s]  Save the village from the archers.
[1467.10s -> 1467.60s]  What?
[1470.57s -> 1473.77s]  Pick up the villagers and place them in the portal over here.
[1473.77s -> 1475.37s]  Where they'll be taken to safety.
[1476.09s -> 1476.59s]  Okay.
[1478.12s -> 1479.32s]  You've got a village report.
[1479.32s -> 1481.80s]  Yes, you put them down in the right place.
[1485.16s -> 1488.12s]  Am I just seeing that?
[1489.08s -> 1489.88s]  Do they have a god?
[1492.52s -> 1494.36s]  Oh my Jesus Christ.
[1495.16s -> 1496.04s]  Oh, those weren't people.
[1496.04s -> 1496.60s]  Okay, it's all right.
[1496.60s -> 1497.32s]  Those weren't people.
[1497.32s -> 1498.68s]  That was just a bunch of pots.
[1498.68s -> 1499.64s]  Those weren't people.
[1499.64s -> 1500.14s]  They were pots.
[1504.22s -> 1511.48s]  Okay, those are people.
[1512.12s -> 1513.32s]  Those were people at that time.
[1513.88s -> 1514.38s]  Those were people.
[1514.38s -> 1515.40s]  What's happening?
[1515.40s -> 1517.00s]  Watch that rumble.
[1517.00s -> 1520.76s]  That creature seems to be performing some strange ritual.
[1522.44s -> 1523.32s]  And he's huge.
[1525.78s -> 1526.82s]  We just have a baby.
[1527.38s -> 1528.82s]  We can't do anything about this.
[1530.74s -> 1531.78s]  Go get him, Murius.
[1531.78s -> 1545.83s]  Let's save as many villages as we can and get out of here.
[1545.83s -> 1546.39s]  I don't think we even...
[1546.39s -> 1548.47s]  I think Murius is still like in a crib somewhere.
[1549.19s -> 1557.19s]  What are these crazed ass tics doing?
[1558.41s -> 1558.91s]  Um...
[1559.55s -> 1561.85s]  Crushed down villages with barrels.
[1563.55s -> 1564.35s]  Oh my God.
[1564.35s -> 1565.31s]  This is horrible.
[1569.88s -> 1571.00s]  This huge fire...
[1571.00s -> 1572.04s]  There are some more barrels...
[1572.04s -> 1573.24s]  Wait, I can do that too.
[1573.24s -> 1574.84s]  Pull the god fence away.
[1574.84s -> 1577.66s]  Who's invading...
[1577.66s -> 1578.30s]  I've learned.
[1579.50s -> 1581.60s]  Why the hell...
[1581.60s -> 1582.24s]  They do like...
[1582.24s -> 1583.36s]  Were those jumps?
[1583.36s -> 1589.36s]  We can set these bales of hay on fire and rule them down to deal with the platoons down there.
[1589.36s -> 1592.96s]  Pick up the flaming stick and hold it over the hay bales.
[1594.48s -> 1595.71s]  Here we go.
[1596.27s -> 1596.77s]  Burn.
[1597.41s -> 1602.24s]  All right, that was a lot.
[1607.41s -> 1608.61s]  Another volcano.
[1609.49s -> 1614.45s]  You can make volcanoes in this game?
[1614.45s -> 1618.53s]  Before you could just like shoot lightning bolts out of your hands and throw fireballs.
[1618.53s -> 1620.13s]  You can make a fucking volcano.
[1626.67s -> 1629.07s]  Murius could just like water plants before.
[1644.32s -> 1651.68s]  Okay.
[1655.12s -> 1655.92s]  So we just...
[1655.92s -> 1658.88s]  All right, so the ass tics just destroyed everybody.
[1658.88s -> 1659.38s]  Okay.
[1661.60s -> 1662.10s]  Let's go.
[1663.20s -> 1664.16s]  Now we've got the story.
[1665.04s -> 1675.65s]  Once they save Murius, they're gonna instantly say,
[1675.65s -> 1677.01s]  You are now our best friend.
[1681.28s -> 1681.92s]  Let's go back.
[1682.48s -> 1683.12s]  The portal.
[1684.32s -> 1686.24s]  Yeah, these guys made it.
[1686.24s -> 1688.64s]  But think of how many got toasted.
[1689.76s -> 1691.44s]  Anyway, where are we?
[1691.44s -> 1694.56s]  This looks like an old Greek settlement.
[1694.56s -> 1697.04s]  We can reestablish ourselves here.
[1697.04s -> 1700.64s]  It looks so peaceful here with no Aztecs.
[1700.64s -> 1704.80s]  It's the perfect place to build up and get more followers.
[1704.80s -> 1705.68s]  There is already...
[1705.68s -> 1707.52s]  Who's the guy that you followed for two hours?
[1707.52s -> 1708.40s]  We don't talk about that.
[1708.40s -> 1710.24s]  A field which we can use.
[1710.24s -> 1711.44s]  That's deleted from the blog.
[1712.00s -> 1714.64s]  He is the extent of your influence.
[1714.64s -> 1717.76s]  You can only do things within this ring.
[1717.76s -> 1724.24s]  You can extend the green influence ring by placing more buildings and having more people.
[1724.24s -> 1724.74s]  Yeah.
[1727.33s -> 1730.69s]  When you're ready to learn how to feed your people,
[1730.69s -> 1733.81s]  click on the gold scroll over the field leader.
[1735.01s -> 1737.74s]  Oh, what's that?
[1737.74s -> 1738.38s]  What did it just do?
[1739.10s -> 1741.65s]  Let me take a look what we got.
[1741.65s -> 1742.61s]  What we got working with here?
[1752.51s -> 1753.71s]  Who sleeps like this?
[1753.95s -> 1758.98s]  It's just...
[1758.98s -> 1762.90s]  He's sleeping with one leg in the air crossed over
[1762.90s -> 1766.90s]  because he's farting so much that he has to sleep in this position.
[1766.90s -> 1769.62s]  He has to sleep in the constant I'm gonna fart position.
[1777.07s -> 1781.18s]  That's unbelievable.
[1781.18s -> 1782.06s]  It's still funny.
[1782.06s -> 1786.22s]  Your villagers are going to need food very soon, leader.
[1786.22s -> 1788.14s]  Move your hand over this field,
[1788.14s -> 1791.66s]  then click and hold the action button to pick up the grain.
[1791.66s -> 1795.26s]  When you've got 200 food in your hand,
[1795.26s -> 1797.74s]  drop all through it into the storehouse.
[1802.82s -> 1805.38s]  Enough food in there, boss.
[1805.38s -> 1806.02s]  How much do I need?
[1807.62s -> 1808.18s]  Can I hold?
[1808.18s -> 1808.50s]  And it goes...
[1809.38s -> 1811.54s]  We now have enough food.
[1811.54s -> 1813.46s]  We need to get our people working.
[1813.46s -> 1815.54s]  This is so much better than the last one.
[1815.54s -> 1816.58s]  It actually tells me...
[1816.58s -> 1820.74s]  Villagers can be turned into disciples who will work at the job you assign them.
[1820.74s -> 1823.94s]  Pick up a villager, then put them down on a field.
[1824.82s -> 1826.80s]  Yeah, that's so much better.
[1826.80s -> 1828.16s]  I can actually see who's working here.
[1830.46s -> 1833.18s]  Now place the villager down over the field.
[1833.90s -> 1837.02s]  You going for it?
[1837.66s -> 1838.86s]  One of the seven, two out of seven.
[1838.86s -> 1839.74s]  Okay, good.
[1839.74s -> 1841.18s]  Reestablish the village, yes.
[1842.91s -> 1843.63s]  Fill it up.
[1843.63s -> 1848.03s]  Those farmers can handle that small field with no problem, boss.
[1848.03s -> 1851.07s]  They actually knew what this game was supposed to be on the first one.
[1851.07s -> 1853.39s]  And our town expand.
[1853.39s -> 1857.87s]  Grab and pull a tree out of the ground and drop it into the storehouse.
[1857.87s -> 1858.43s]  You can still do that.
[1858.43s -> 1858.83s]  That's good.
[1859.55s -> 1860.43s]  When it gets desperate.
[1861.39s -> 1866.72s]  Owls and tribute.
[1866.72s -> 1867.92s]  Got some wood.
[1867.92s -> 1869.68s]  Do I have any choppers?
[1869.68s -> 1872.96s]  Some disciple foresters to collect wood for us.
[1872.96s -> 1878.72s]  Pick up a villager and drop them next to a tree to make them a disciple forester.
[1878.72s -> 1881.04s]  Make a total of three foresters.
[1881.76s -> 1884.64s]  Make two disciple foresters.
[1884.64s -> 1887.68s]  Now place the villager next to a tree.
[1889.04s -> 1892.40s]  We got some nifty foresting going on, boss.
[1893.60s -> 1897.82s]  No, I didn't.
[1898.06s -> 1898.62s]  All right, they're gone.
[1899.82s -> 1907.26s]  As of February 20th, 2022, links are gone.
[1907.26s -> 1907.98s]  Not links.
[1907.98s -> 1910.62s]  Well, that just shows how much, well, that's how I really feel.
[1911.18s -> 1911.90s]  What was I saying?
[1911.90s -> 1912.54s]  Winks are gone.
[1921.07s -> 1921.95s]  I was trying to drop it in here.
[1924.22s -> 1925.82s]  There's a wink right there.
[1925.82s -> 1931.62s]  It's changing.
[1931.62s -> 1933.22s]  It's changing this next week.
[1933.22s -> 1934.98s]  Click on the gold scroll.
[1935.62s -> 1944.96s]  April?
[1944.96s -> 1946.00s]  No, not April.
[1946.56s -> 1947.60s]  That's like two months from now.
[1947.60s -> 1952.08s]  The statues on your town center represent your town's desires.
[1954.56s -> 1957.92s]  This shows what your people would like to build next.
[1957.92s -> 1960.48s]  Keeping your people happy is important.
[1960.48s -> 1963.20s]  They will let you know if they desire a building type.
[1965.63s -> 1967.95s]  See how the statue is carrying grain?
[1967.95s -> 1969.15s]  That means you want food.
[1969.15s -> 1971.95s]  That represents the people's desires for food.
[1971.95s -> 1974.75s]  If they need ore or wood, they will let you know.
[1975.39s -> 1978.11s]  Keep an eye on the statue as it will change.
[1978.75s -> 1981.30s]  Why is he wearing a backpack?
[1981.30s -> 1984.02s]  This place's height represents how good or evil you are.
[1984.02s -> 1984.74s]  A fucking backpack.
[1984.74s -> 1990.90s]  From the top, a flame or a fountain will spring as you perform your good deeds.
[1990.90s -> 1995.38s]  The whole city will shift to show you if you are good or evil.
[1997.86s -> 2001.30s]  This statue lets you know your people's desires.
[2001.30s -> 2003.30s]  Watch the height of the statue.
[2003.30s -> 2007.06s]  The higher it is, the more they need their desire.
[2007.06s -> 2007.56s]  Okay.
[2007.64s -> 2012.84s]  This scroll shows the impressiveness of your city.
[2012.84s -> 2015.48s]  Its population and happiness.
[2015.48s -> 2020.04s]  There is plenty of other useful information about your growing metropolis.
[2020.04s -> 2021.40s]  Refer to it often.
[2023.24s -> 2024.52s]  So that's the need.
[2024.52s -> 2025.56s]  That's how evil I am.
[2025.56s -> 2029.16s]  Hold your hand over the statues and leave it there to get more detail.
[2029.16s -> 2029.66s]  Alright, that's good.
[2031.00s -> 2034.32s]  So right now we're doing great.
[2035.28s -> 2035.78s]  Ohms.
[2036.56s -> 2038.40s]  Oh, this is so much better.
[2039.04s -> 2040.00s]  Oh my god.
[2040.00s -> 2041.12s]  It's so much better.
[2041.68s -> 2042.32s]  Look at that.
[2042.32s -> 2044.40s]  If you get, it's wow.
[2044.40s -> 2046.32s]  They, what an improvement from the last game.
[2047.12s -> 2047.36s]  All right.
[2047.36s -> 2048.48s]  Why am I evil?
[2048.48s -> 2049.36s]  I didn't even do anything.
[2050.08s -> 2051.92s]  I'm 0.1% evil.
[2051.92s -> 2052.42s]  How?
[2053.04s -> 2053.76s]  I didn't do shit.
[2054.56s -> 2059.65s]  All right.
[2059.65s -> 2060.21s]  Let's keep going.
[2067.84s -> 2070.32s]  Your people desire houses.
[2070.32s -> 2072.88s]  Move your hand over the rotating building.
[2072.88s -> 2076.48s]  Then click and hold the action button to drag it off.
[2076.48s -> 2076.98s]  Wait, what?
[2076.98s -> 2081.30s]  We need the right buildings and food if we're going to support a powerful army.
[2081.86s -> 2082.90s]  So hold on.
[2082.90s -> 2086.46s]  This is how you make buildings now?
[2086.46s -> 2089.18s]  Click the action button again to place it down.
[2089.18s -> 2089.42s]  All right.
[2089.42s -> 2093.10s]  We got to, we got to put, I got to do this right because this is the first like actual mission.
[2093.66s -> 2095.10s]  Let's go back here.
[2096.06s -> 2097.10s]  That's right.
[2097.10s -> 2098.14s]  Keep going.
[2098.14s -> 2102.06s]  We can speed it up by picking up a tree and dropping it on the building.
[2106.63s -> 2108.63s]  How much wood does it need?
[2108.63s -> 2111.59s]  Your villagers will use that to build the house with.
[2112.71s -> 2114.55s]  Did I lost the tutorial?
[2114.55s -> 2115.67s]  No, this is the real game.
[2115.67s -> 2117.43s]  The tutorial, we were on tutorial island.
[2118.39s -> 2119.86s]  Now how much do you need?
[2120.74s -> 2122.10s]  320 wood, what do I have here?
[2124.02s -> 2126.50s]  609 wood, what the fuck?
[2126.50s -> 2128.66s]  I need a builder, right?
[2128.66s -> 2130.68s]  Come here.
[2130.68s -> 2131.24s]  You.
[2131.24s -> 2131.74s]  Builder.
[2133.70s -> 2134.98s]  Disciple builder.
[2137.86s -> 2139.62s]  He's going to corrupt the save again.
[2140.42s -> 2140.92s]  What?
[2146.62s -> 2148.30s]  Place 11 foundations.
[2149.50s -> 2150.14s]  Are you serious?
[2150.86s -> 2154.28s]  Oh, I got to place 11 houses?
[2156.60s -> 2157.72s]  That's a lot of houses.
[2158.60s -> 2159.24s]  Keep going.
[2165.72s -> 2167.00s]  How much, how much wood do I need?
[2173.05s -> 2174.25s]  Subtitles are riot.
[2174.81s -> 2176.33s]  What do you need subtitles for?
[2176.33s -> 2177.45s]  How do I rotate?
[2177.45s -> 2179.69s]  Is there like an altar?
[2179.69s -> 2180.57s]  How do I rotate?
[2180.57s -> 2181.21s]  R?
[2181.21s -> 2183.43s]  Middle mouse?
[2183.43s -> 2184.23s]  Right mouse?
[2184.23s -> 2185.03s]  How do I rotate?
[2185.67s -> 2191.83s]  I can't rotate.
[2192.39s -> 2193.27s]  Tell me how to rotate.
[2194.15s -> 2195.51s]  The house is finished.
[2195.51s -> 2196.15s]  Tell me how to rotate.
[2196.15s -> 2198.63s]  And look how delighted the villagers are.
[2201.29s -> 2203.37s]  Oh, okay, good.
[2206.34s -> 2210.50s]  You can also drag a building blueprint off an existing house.
[2210.50s -> 2210.82s]  Really?
[2210.82s -> 2213.62s]  Move your hand over the existing house.
[2213.62s -> 2217.70s]  Hold down the action button and drag to get the blueprint.
[2217.70s -> 2220.98s]  If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand,
[2220.98s -> 2223.22s]  simply shake it briskly left and right.
[2224.66s -> 2234.73s]  We need to have, these laws have to be good.
[2238.63s -> 2239.27s]  Photoshop.
[2241.35s -> 2243.43s]  That's not even accurate.
[2243.43s -> 2244.63s]  Why did you say that?
[2244.63s -> 2246.71s]  I'm, I'm, I can't.
[2246.71s -> 2247.35s]  Why?
[2247.35s -> 2252.09s]  It can also help to build buildings yourself.
[2252.09s -> 2253.29s]  Come on, I want to learn.
[2253.29s -> 2254.97s]  This is God building.
[2254.97s -> 2257.77s]  Yes, you do it by picking up resources the building needs.
[2257.77s -> 2259.21s]  What can sign in the way?
[2259.21s -> 2261.61s]  Then hold your hand over the building
[2261.61s -> 2264.25s]  and press and hold the action button.
[2264.25s -> 2266.25s]  This is very useful,
[2266.25s -> 2269.85s]  but you do lose some of the resource in the process.
[2269.85s -> 2270.65s]  So wait, I can build?
[2270.65s -> 2273.05s]  Make two disciple builders.
[2273.05s -> 2275.77s]  We can also create some disciple builders
[2275.77s -> 2277.85s]  to help with our city building.
[2277.85s -> 2279.29s]  Just drop a villager by house.
[2279.29s -> 2280.41s]  Then you drop them down by a house.
[2280.41s -> 2281.45s]  It's under construction to create one.
[2281.45s -> 2282.65s]  Hold the action button.
[2282.65s -> 2284.65s]  Make three disciple builders.
[2288.49s -> 2288.97s]  Okay, hold on.
[2290.89s -> 2293.45s]  Why am I using ray key to try to build a house?
[2293.45s -> 2294.41s]  That's not how this works.
[2295.85s -> 2298.52s]  What do I have to do with the tree in my hand?
[2300.36s -> 2301.00s]  Keep going.
[2302.68s -> 2307.11s]  Or drop the person by a building site.
[2307.11s -> 2309.03s]  I need four more foundations.
[2309.99s -> 2311.19s]  Wait, this is facing the wrong way.
[2316.58s -> 2318.42s]  Okay, well, all right.
[2318.42s -> 2320.10s]  We're going to expand this way anyways.
[2323.24s -> 2327.35s]  Let's go over here.
[2328.95s -> 2330.87s]  We'll have like the one community, one community.
[2331.51s -> 2332.79s]  Three more foundations.
[2336.41s -> 2338.81s]  You need to create a disciple builder.
[2339.45s -> 2353.48s]  This town sucks.
[2355.08s -> 2356.52s]  This wasn't even in the last game.
[2357.16s -> 2365.56s]  This will be the expensive house that's back here.
[2366.20s -> 2368.76s]  You need to create a disciple builder.
[2368.76s -> 2369.56s]  I know, hold on.
[2369.56s -> 2378.78s]  Excellent.
[2378.78s -> 2380.86s]  We've got a nice little troop of builders.
[2381.50s -> 2382.95s]  Can I get rid of the sign?
[2383.59s -> 2385.06s]  It's blocking me.
[2386.14s -> 2387.10s]  Fields within roads.
[2387.10s -> 2388.30s]  You may lay out roads.
[2388.30s -> 2390.94s]  You can fill inside them with a field by dragging out.
[2390.94s -> 2393.34s]  The field will make the road as its boundary.
[2395.59s -> 2395.83s]  What?
[2397.43s -> 2407.93s]  If you lay out roads, how do I lay out a road?
[2408.49s -> 2412.68s]  I didn't do that part yet.
[2412.68s -> 2413.64s]  That's not in the tutorial.
[2414.44s -> 2415.80s]  Drag from the road.
[2416.44s -> 2429.43s]  Oh, shit.
[2429.43s -> 2431.11s]  You can make roads in this one.
[2431.83s -> 2432.31s]  So we have to...
[2439.70s -> 2440.02s]  All right.
[2442.84s -> 2445.88s]  Should I go from here and just like this?
[2446.76s -> 2450.47s]  No, this is a bad road.
[2450.47s -> 2450.79s]  That's not right.
[2450.79s -> 2451.27s]  That's not right.
[2452.42s -> 2454.34s]  Building snap to the roads.
[2454.34s -> 2455.06s]  Oh, fuck.
[2455.06s -> 2455.70s]  This is wrong.
[2456.34s -> 2463.78s]  Oh, this is really bad because now these will never be on a road
[2463.78s -> 2464.90s]  unless I go in the middle here.
[2464.90s -> 2465.38s]  All right, here we go.
[2465.38s -> 2465.62s]  Ready?
[2466.74s -> 2473.82s]  Can I move the houses?
[2474.62s -> 2477.90s]  No, no, no, no.
[2477.90s -> 2478.94s]  That's making another house.
[2479.66s -> 2514.50s]  I didn't know this was possible.
[2514.50s -> 2515.78s]  Come on, give me a break.
[2515.78s -> 2517.40s]  That's all right.
[2517.40s -> 2517.96s]  It's okay.
[2517.96s -> 2518.28s]  Whatever.
[2518.28s -> 2519.08s]  It's the first level.
[2519.08s -> 2519.56s]  Who cares?
[2522.50s -> 2523.54s]  This is the problem, though.
[2523.54s -> 2523.70s]  All right.
[2523.70s -> 2524.90s]  So we need to go from here to here.
[2525.54s -> 2540.01s]  I can't go like...
[2549.67s -> 2551.67s]  What some roads are like this.
[2551.67s -> 2552.39s]  What am I supposed to do?
[2553.51s -> 2554.15s]  Delete them all?
[2565.22s -> 2565.70s]  Yes.
[2565.70s -> 2566.18s]  It was done.
[2566.98s -> 2569.14s]  It was done with a crayon by a five-year-old,
[2569.14s -> 2570.90s]  but I didn't know you could even do this shit.
[2571.70s -> 2572.26s]  That's fine.
[2572.26s -> 2572.82s]  It's fine.
[2572.82s -> 2573.22s]  It's fine.
[2573.22s -> 2573.70s]  It works.
[2574.34s -> 2578.23s]  Let's connect these.
[2578.23s -> 2579.91s]  But I'm gonna need to construct five villas.
[2579.91s -> 2580.71s]  Hold on.
[2580.71s -> 2585.27s]  Let's go out to here and then we're gonna...
[2585.27s -> 2585.51s]  Oh, fuck.
[2585.51s -> 2586.63s]  This is so wrong.
[2586.95s -> 2588.31s]  If I had known that roads existed,
[2588.31s -> 2589.35s]  I would have done this differently.
[2589.35s -> 2590.07s]  All right.
[2590.07s -> 2591.35s]  We're just gonna bucket.
[2591.35s -> 2592.07s]  This is the first level.
[2592.07s -> 2602.46s]  Ooh, it's the first level.
[2602.46s -> 2603.42s]  It doesn't matter.
[2603.42s -> 2605.37s]  All right.
[2605.37s -> 2607.21s]  Now I need to make five villas.
[2607.85s -> 2610.39s]  I have enough builders, right?
[2611.43s -> 2612.47s]  What do people need?
[2613.67s -> 2614.76s]  Free time.
[2615.40s -> 2619.59s]  Throw a villager.
[2619.59s -> 2621.59s]  No, I'm not throwing a villager right now.
[2627.53s -> 2628.09s]  Did you know?
[2628.65s -> 2629.61s]  With a villager in hand,
[2629.61s -> 2631.29s]  keep the hand still to get detailed information
[2631.29s -> 2632.41s]  about the person you're holding.
[2633.21s -> 2635.40s]  I need to make villas.
[2637.24s -> 2639.56s]  Uh, I was too busy looking at the roads.
[2639.56s -> 2640.68s]  What do I have to do for a villa?
[2644.55s -> 2646.47s]  Adult population, 34.
[2646.47s -> 2647.19s]  We need some...
[2647.19s -> 2648.23s]  We have a high brick road.
[2648.23s -> 2648.63s]  Good.
[2648.63s -> 2650.47s]  You've built enough houses for now.
[2650.47s -> 2651.67s]  Oh, that's a house as a villa.
[2651.67s -> 2654.71s]  We must get the people to multiply.
[2654.71s -> 2655.51s]  Oh, dear.
[2655.51s -> 2656.87s]  It's embarrassing talking.
[2656.87s -> 2657.59s]  Nowhere it ain't.
[2657.59s -> 2658.15s]  Where's the cow?
[2658.15s -> 2660.55s]  He's talking about breeding.
[2660.55s -> 2661.99s]  Breeding, boss.
[2661.99s -> 2663.19s]  You hear me, goody?
[2663.19s -> 2664.15s]  Just over here, fart sleeping.
[2664.15s -> 2665.51s]  We need three breeder disciples
[2665.51s -> 2667.91s]  to satisfy the village's needs.
[2667.91s -> 2670.15s]  Drop a man or woman from your hand
[2670.15s -> 2672.95s]  next to one of the opposite sex.
[2672.95s -> 2675.67s]  Disciple breeders will continue forever.
[2676.71s -> 2678.23s]  All right, you and you.
[2678.23s -> 2679.27s]  Excellent.
[2679.27s -> 2682.79s]  We need two more to satisfy the village's needs.
[2686.09s -> 2689.21s]  We need a breeder, breeder, breeder, breeder,
[2689.21s -> 2691.61s]  builder, builder, breeder, breed.
[2693.05s -> 2694.17s]  Oh, you are a breeder.
[2694.17s -> 2694.67s]  Okay.
[2696.41s -> 2696.97s]  Oh, we need...
[2697.69s -> 2698.73s]  All right, we got a male here.
[2700.20s -> 2700.84s]  Uh, you.
[2702.28s -> 2704.04s]  And you stop what you're doing?
[2704.60s -> 2705.40s]  Marvelous.
[2705.40s -> 2706.04s]  Do that instead.
[2706.04s -> 2708.04s]  You've now created enough breeders.
[2708.04s -> 2711.64s]  Any disciple will carry on doing that one job forever
[2711.64s -> 2713.56s]  unless you give them another job.
[2713.56s -> 2714.84s]  They want free time?
[2714.84s -> 2715.40s]  Do they have...
[2715.40s -> 2716.44s]  No, breeding...
[2716.44s -> 2717.48s]  No, they want free time.
[2717.48s -> 2718.76s]  They want to breed and they want to sleep.
[2719.48s -> 2722.60s]  Well, I just built the houses, so...
[2725.03s -> 2727.19s]  Forever, forever sex.
[2728.58s -> 2728.98s]  Sort of.
[2730.55s -> 2731.19s]  All right, now...
[2732.07s -> 2733.99s]  I'm gonna get some breeding here.
[2734.87s -> 2737.99s]  What we need to do is increase our population.
[2737.99s -> 2738.55s]  That's what we're doing.
[2738.55s -> 2739.99s]  Now we've got some breeders.
[2739.99s -> 2742.71s]  It should be easy to get 75 villages.
[2744.23s -> 2745.83s]  Increase population by 41.
[2745.83s -> 2746.31s]  All right, hold on.
[2746.31s -> 2747.11s]  What is this?
[2747.11s -> 2748.55s]  Ore desire?
[2748.55s -> 2750.98s]  This is ore right...
[2750.98s -> 2751.62s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[2751.62s -> 2752.26s]  We need some...
[2752.26s -> 2752.82s]  This is new.
[2754.42s -> 2754.82s]  Builder.
[2756.04s -> 2756.76s]  Mine worker.
[2758.12s -> 2760.65s]  This is a new resource.
[2765.75s -> 2769.99s]  Click the gold scroll when you are ready to learn about the toolbar.
[2770.95s -> 2771.83s]  Hold on.
[2771.83s -> 2772.23s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2772.23s -> 2773.59s]  I gotta get some people working in the mines.
[2774.55s -> 2775.59s]  Too young to be a...
[2776.63s -> 2776.87s]  What?
[2777.59s -> 2781.90s]  Who is it?
[2781.90s -> 2786.76s]  Karen Segal James.
[2786.76s -> 2787.56s]  Happiness.
[2787.56s -> 2789.08s]  Minus 0.84.
[2789.08s -> 2789.72s]  Depressed.
[2789.72s -> 2790.60s]  Health 100.
[2790.60s -> 2790.92s]  Breed.
[2791.56s -> 2793.06s]  Okay, well...
[2793.06s -> 2793.54s]  Whatever.
[2794.42s -> 2800.57s]  Right, let's open the toolbar.
[2800.57s -> 2801.05s]  See?
[2801.05s -> 2803.69s]  There is a flag at the bottom left of the screen.
[2803.69s -> 2804.01s]  Toolbar.
[2804.01s -> 2808.65s]  All you need to do to open it is click the action button on it once.
[2808.65s -> 2810.57s]  Okay, that's kind of in a weird spot.
[2810.57s -> 2811.85s]  It's like all the way down here.
[2813.86s -> 2815.30s]  Hey, what's that?
[2815.30s -> 2816.74s]  That is the toolbar.
[2816.74s -> 2818.02s]  There's gotta be a hotkey for this, right?
[2818.02s -> 2818.90s]  Good.
[2818.90s -> 2820.98s]  Now click again to close it.
[2821.86s -> 2823.14s]  There's gotta be a hotbar for this.
[2823.78s -> 2824.18s]  F1.
[2824.98s -> 2825.70s]  Oh, yeah.
[2825.70s -> 2828.73s]  That's much better.
[2828.73s -> 2829.61s]  So this is awesome.
[2831.21s -> 2832.09s]  So much easier.
[2832.09s -> 2836.01s]  These tabs are used to navigate the different menus.
[2836.01s -> 2839.53s]  The tab currently selected is the construction tab.
[2839.61s -> 2842.81s]  So the menu shown is the construction menu.
[2842.81s -> 2845.85s]  Each menu is divided into submenus.
[2845.85s -> 2850.01s]  We are going to show you how to access some advanced features.
[2850.97s -> 2852.09s]  Advanced, boys and girls.
[2852.09s -> 2853.93s]  Bring up the tribute menu.
[2853.93s -> 2855.13s]  Tribute menu, F4.
[2857.13s -> 2858.89s]  This is the coolest part of the menu.
[2858.89s -> 2859.85s]  Torture pit?
[2859.85s -> 2862.25s]  The tribute is like a form of currency.
[2862.25s -> 2863.45s]  Why is that the first thing there?
[2863.45s -> 2867.05s]  You can spend it on whatever you like, including new buildings.
[2867.05s -> 2869.29s]  You can improve your godly powers.
[2869.53s -> 2872.89s]  And add constructions or features to your town.
[2872.89s -> 2876.01s]  You earn tribute by finishing challenges
[2876.01s -> 2878.65s]  and doing other impressive things.
[2878.65s -> 2881.29s]  We have plenty of tribute at the moment.
[2881.29s -> 2883.21s]  Enough to buy a temple.
[2885.67s -> 2890.07s]  So the faithful will flock to this edifice erected in your glory.
[2890.07s -> 2893.43s]  Their earnest worship will be amplified in this holy place.
[2893.43s -> 2894.63s]  And not only will your people be happier,
[2894.63s -> 2897.03s]  but your entire town will be much more enhanced and impressiveness.
[2898.44s -> 2899.72s]  Okay, let's get it.
[2900.68s -> 2904.74s]  There it is.
[2904.74s -> 2907.14s]  You can now build a temple.
[2907.14s -> 2910.10s]  This is a good thing with a capital G.
[2910.82s -> 2914.02s]  Your town's impressiveness will increase.
[2914.02s -> 2917.22s]  Select the temple from the construction menu.
[2917.22s -> 2919.38s]  Then place it down in your town.
[2919.38s -> 2920.18s]  Torture pit.
[2920.98s -> 2921.86s]  But why would I?
[2921.86s -> 2923.22s]  I'm like afraid to do that.
[2924.26s -> 2924.74s]  All right.
[2924.74s -> 2925.86s]  Oh, this is huge.
[2925.86s -> 2926.10s]  All right.
[2926.10s -> 2926.74s]  We're going to put this...
[2928.84s -> 2930.28s]  That's not a bad spot for it.
[2930.28s -> 2931.40s]  Or should we have this for...
[2931.40s -> 2933.56s]  This is like our real estate community.
[2933.64s -> 2935.64s]  This would be our business section over here.
[2935.64s -> 2935.88s]  Right?
[2935.88s -> 2936.92s]  Like down here?
[2936.92s -> 2939.59s]  No, these are going to be houses over here.
[2940.15s -> 2946.54s]  I think like right here.
[2946.54s -> 2948.94s]  No, it's going to be connected to a road behind here.
[2950.49s -> 2951.93s]  The torture pit is going to go down here.
[2951.93s -> 2952.57s]  So it's all right.
[2955.83s -> 2957.67s]  I'm thinking like right here.
[2959.96s -> 2963.08s]  Select the temple from the construction menu.
[2963.08s -> 2965.24s]  Then place it down in your town.
[2965.24s -> 2965.64s]  Right here.
[2965.64s -> 2966.36s]  Right in the edge.
[2966.36s -> 2969.24s]  Some buildings require all to be built.
[2969.24s -> 2971.64s]  There are two sources of all.
[2971.64s -> 2976.52s]  The first is the ore mine and ore deposit in the ground
[2976.52s -> 2978.84s]  that can be mined by your villagers.
[2978.84s -> 2981.56s]  There are also all rocks.
[2981.56s -> 2984.60s]  The villagers can mine these but at the same time
[2984.60s -> 2986.92s]  you can add them to your storehouse yourself.
[2986.92s -> 2988.52s]  Oh, I just pick up the ore.
[2988.52s -> 2989.40s]  So they can't do this.
[2990.60s -> 2991.32s]  I can do this.
[2993.67s -> 2994.07s]  Here we go.
[2994.07s -> 2995.03s]  Ore is over here.
[2995.91s -> 2996.23s]  Boom.
[2997.03s -> 2997.91s]  Oh, boom.
[2998.55s -> 3001.53s]  I got to be careful I don't hit anybody with this.
[3001.53s -> 3002.49s]  I don't want to hit anybody with this.
[3003.13s -> 3006.10s]  Let's just pick them all up.
[3006.10s -> 3007.14s]  Get it over with and done.
[3008.02s -> 3010.90s]  And then conquer whatever we need to conquer.
[3010.90s -> 3011.78s]  Oh wait, 22.
[3011.78s -> 3012.58s]  All right, temple.
[3012.58s -> 3013.54s]  Temple's not built yet.
[3014.10s -> 3015.70s]  It's time for the torture pit.
[3018.14s -> 3020.22s]  No, I'm not a fucking monster.
[3020.22s -> 3022.22s]  That's not the second building I'm going to build.
[3039.61s -> 3040.09s]  Oh, right.
[3040.09s -> 3040.73s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3040.73s -> 3040.97s]  Okay.
[3040.97s -> 3041.45s]  I got it.
[3041.45s -> 3041.77s]  I got it.
[3041.77s -> 3042.09s]  I got it.
[3042.09s -> 3042.57s]  I got it.
[3044.41s -> 3053.13s]  Builder.
[3053.13s -> 3053.69s]  You.
[3053.69s -> 3056.20s]  Who are you?
[3056.20s -> 3056.60s]  You build.
[3058.44s -> 3058.84s]  I'll help.
[3064.34s -> 3065.30s]  You coming over here too?
[3065.30s -> 3066.10s]  You're going to help build?
[3069.29s -> 3069.53s]  No.
[3069.53s -> 3070.73s]  Why are you just following this person?
[3070.73s -> 3070.97s]  Okay.
[3071.77s -> 3075.54s]  Why have I run out of trees?
[3082.52s -> 3083.48s]  They need to breed.
[3084.28s -> 3085.72s]  My population's doing fine.
[3085.72s -> 3086.76s]  15, 14.
[3087.32s -> 3087.96s]  We're almost done.
[3095.70s -> 3096.18s]  Is that it?
[3096.98s -> 3098.92s]  Why am I holding like a dead tree?
[3106.06s -> 3108.30s]  Oh, I think I'm outside of the ring.
[3108.30s -> 3108.70s]  Wait, what?
[3109.82s -> 3111.29s]  What are you talking about?
[3114.18s -> 3115.54s]  I'm inside the ring.
[3116.18s -> 3119.88s]  Oh, it needs ore.
[3120.44s -> 3124.30s]  Oh, okay.
[3124.94s -> 3130.52s]  Oh, come here.
[3130.52s -> 3134.57s]  1,200 ore.
[3134.57s -> 3135.53s]  1,000 ore.
[3135.53s -> 3135.93s]  What?
[3135.93s -> 3136.57s]  Come on.
[3136.57s -> 3137.13s]  Is this ore?
[3138.33s -> 3143.03s]  What are you doing?
[3143.03s -> 3149.13s]  300 ore.
[3149.13s -> 3150.09s]  Almost there.
[3150.09s -> 3150.81s]  Where's the cow?
[3151.77s -> 3152.25s]  Resting.
[3152.97s -> 3154.73s]  Because the cow is not doing...
[3154.73s -> 3155.85s]  The cow can't do anything yet.
[3157.08s -> 3157.96s]  But we'll check in.
[3158.52s -> 3159.69s]  It's still sleeping.
[3159.69s -> 3160.81s]  It's been like seven days.
[3161.53s -> 3168.33s]  What a lazy bastard.
[3168.33s -> 3170.41s]  No, he's a baby.
[3174.02s -> 3176.26s]  And plus, wait, it's a cow.
[3181.70s -> 3182.34s]  It's a she.
[3183.14s -> 3184.65s]  It's a cow.
[3192.04s -> 3193.16s]  Cow, it's a cow.
[3210.49s -> 3215.40s]  How do people get so many channel points?
[3215.40s -> 3217.56s]  If you subscribe, you get double.
[3217.56s -> 3219.99s]  All right, we got the temple now.
[3219.99s -> 3220.95s]  We're very impressive.
[3220.95s -> 3224.55s]  Oops, I just dropped a rock on it.
[3224.55s -> 3226.63s]  I just smashed a window accidentally.
[3226.63s -> 3227.43s]  It says, is it okay?
[3229.00s -> 3232.06s]  All right, impressiveness went up.
[3234.07s -> 3235.27s]  I need one more population.
[3235.67s -> 3237.43s]  Very impressive city.
[3237.43s -> 3241.83s]  Then people will come from far and wide to live in it.
[3241.83s -> 3245.91s]  Civic buildings are a good way to increase impressiveness.
[3245.91s -> 3251.67s]  Nobody gets hurt and we get more followers making us more powerful.
[3251.67s -> 3254.46s]  Why'd you build the temple on an incline?
[3254.46s -> 3256.38s]  Look, those people are migrating.
[3256.38s -> 3258.70s]  They want to live in our town.
[3258.70s -> 3261.26s]  They're bringing all their worldly goods.
[3261.26s -> 3261.76s]  Hooray!
[3262.54s -> 3266.14s]  People of all tribes will be drawn from far and wide.
[3266.14s -> 3266.62s]  Here they come.
[3266.62s -> 3268.38s]  To live in a good city.
[3268.38s -> 3270.14s]  Come on, it's time to do something.
[3271.74s -> 3274.44s]  Here they come.
[3275.32s -> 3278.82s]  They're coming because they want to see the impressive city.
[3281.82s -> 3282.54s]  Come on over.
[3283.34s -> 3283.82s]  Take a look.
[3284.38s -> 3285.42s]  Have you seen the cow?
[3287.80s -> 3288.84s]  Take a look at the cow.
[3288.84s -> 3290.60s]  All right, it's time to do some work.
[3291.40s -> 3291.88s]  You got to go.
[3292.44s -> 3293.88s]  They'll make people laugh and stuff.
[3294.60s -> 3299.78s]  Let's not disturb him.
[3303.45s -> 3304.17s]  I can't even wait.
[3306.62s -> 3308.46s]  All right, I'm just waiting for them to come in.
[3308.46s -> 3314.71s]  All right, who's this?
[3314.71s -> 3317.62s]  What are these people doing?
[3318.50s -> 3320.74s]  I don't like the look of those fellows.
[3320.74s -> 3322.34s]  Why, they have swords?
[3322.34s -> 3328.92s]  Where are they going?
[3328.92s -> 3329.64s]  I can't grab them.
[3332.18s -> 3333.22s]  This is an RTS.
[3333.22s -> 3334.42s]  This person has patrols.
[3334.42s -> 3334.92s]  Okay.
[3336.07s -> 3337.51s]  Look at that town.
[3337.51s -> 3339.35s]  It's not dissimilar from ours.
[3340.15s -> 3341.34s]  Hi, guys.
[3345.02s -> 3346.30s]  All right, are they almost here?
[3346.30s -> 3347.02s]  Let's welcome them.
[3347.74s -> 3352.50s]  Let's welcome them by immediately grabbing the person with the flag
[3352.50s -> 3353.78s]  and throwing them as far as we can.
[3354.50s -> 3359.13s]  I don't like that, though.
[3359.13s -> 3361.05s]  They're going to come over here and kill us.
[3361.05s -> 3364.18s]  All right, anybody who's at the temple?
[3364.18s -> 3364.68s]  Anybody?
[3365.14s -> 3366.25s]  No worshipers?
[3366.97s -> 3369.59s]  Here, use it.
[3370.49s -> 3371.69s]  Do you worship at that building?
[3372.41s -> 3375.46s]  Oh, here they come.
[3378.70s -> 3381.74s]  These people have come to join our town.
[3381.74s -> 3387.02s]  Pick up their migration flag and drop it anywhere within our influence ring.
[3388.22s -> 3389.98s]  Wait, they have a migration flag?
[3391.10s -> 3391.60s]  Okay.
[3394.33s -> 3394.83s]  18,000.
[3400.34s -> 3402.18s]  Torture pit, torture pit, torture pit.
[3402.18s -> 3403.14s]  Oh, God.
[3403.14s -> 3403.94s]  All right, hold on.
[3406.34s -> 3407.54s]  Look at how many people are here now.
[3407.54s -> 3408.42s]  This is Breeder.
[3408.98s -> 3409.38s]  This is...
[3411.72s -> 3412.92s]  Wait, before anybody does anything.
[3419.14s -> 3420.02s]  Let's get some more people.
[3420.02s -> 3421.14s]  I need some workers.
[3421.78s -> 3423.00s]  All right, let's go.
[3423.00s -> 3424.04s]  How many people are in this field?
[3425.32s -> 3426.28s]  Zero to 17.
[3426.28s -> 3426.60s]  Hold on.
[3426.60s -> 3427.64s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3428.86s -> 3429.82s]  Guys, guys, guys, guys.
[3429.82s -> 3431.02s]  I know you just came in, but here.
[3433.66s -> 3434.16s]  Let's go.
[3437.54s -> 3438.04s]  I need more.
[3438.90s -> 3439.78s]  I need more buildings.
[3446.04s -> 3447.16s]  Okay, wait.
[3447.16s -> 3447.66s]  Breeder.
[3449.32s -> 3450.76s]  We want Breeder again.
[3452.39s -> 3453.91s]  We want Farmer.
[3455.35s -> 3455.99s]  What are the needs?
[3456.55s -> 3457.03s]  I'm looking.
[3457.03s -> 3457.51s]  I'm a good guy.
[3458.31s -> 3459.27s]  4.9% good.
[3459.27s -> 3460.87s]  Pick on the gold scroll.
[3464.84s -> 3469.08s]  Armories are where you can turn your people into warriors.
[3469.72s -> 3470.36s]  Really?
[3470.36s -> 3470.86s]  Holy shit.
[3470.86s -> 3474.20s]  Warriors who can take other towns and lands by force.
[3474.20s -> 3478.52s]  Buying the armory is the first step towards having an army.
[3478.92s -> 3481.88s]  Open the toolbar and click the tribute tab.
[3484.84s -> 3485.34s]  Armory.
[3485.96s -> 3489.00s]  Why build that when you can build an armory?
[3491.10s -> 3493.34s]  Why build the temple when you could build an armory?
[3496.12s -> 3496.68s]  It's burning.
[3497.50s -> 3499.90s]  It's just that every voice is burning, isn't it?
[3502.02s -> 3505.06s]  Recruit powerful armies made up of strong brave swordsmen.
[3505.06s -> 3507.62s]  Almost scarily eager to do battle in your name against your enemies.
[3509.06s -> 3509.87s]  Let's get it.
[3510.35s -> 3514.67s]  Select the armory from the construction menu.
[3514.67s -> 3517.15s]  Then place it down in your town.
[3518.43s -> 3521.23s]  All right, where should I put this?
[3521.95s -> 3524.04s]  How about over here?
[3525.00s -> 3525.96s]  Where's the nearest town?
[3527.04s -> 3527.28s]  Down?
[3527.28s -> 3528.96s]  All right, I want it down here.
[3528.96s -> 3532.20s]  Somewhere like over here on the edge.
[3532.20s -> 3534.80s]  Where's the entrance?
[3535.36s -> 3536.24s]  Right there?
[3536.24s -> 3537.36s]  Okay, so we're going to go like this.
[3537.36s -> 3538.88s]  We're going to have a road eventually connect here.
[3539.92s -> 3540.42s]  Right there.
[3540.96s -> 3544.12s]  Let's get some roads.
[3544.76s -> 3548.65s]  How about like this?
[3548.65s -> 3549.93s]  Split around the farm.
[3549.93s -> 3550.89s]  That looks nice.
[3550.89s -> 3552.09s]  Oh, that looks nice.
[3552.81s -> 3556.14s]  Oh, this way over here.
[3556.78s -> 3558.76s]  Oh, look, that looks nice.
[3561.76s -> 3564.00s]  Then from here, we're going to go this way.
[3571.08s -> 3572.52s]  God sucks at design.
[3573.08s -> 3574.28s]  Why am I evil for doing this?
[3576.33s -> 3578.89s]  Oh, because I'm building an evil building.
[3580.52s -> 3581.08s]  I get it.
[3581.64s -> 3582.92s]  It's an evil building.
[3597.15s -> 3600.86s]  Go.
[3600.86s -> 3601.50s]  Evil.
[3601.50s -> 3602.88s]  How much does it need?
[3602.88s -> 3605.37s]  810 wood, 500 ore.
[3607.72s -> 3610.04s]  Uneven.
[3610.04s -> 3611.08s]  Doesn't need to be even.
[3613.18s -> 3615.63s]  Marius, when are you going to wake up?
[3615.63s -> 3617.31s]  I want to play fun games with you.
[3617.95s -> 3619.79s]  Like kick the tree.
[3620.88s -> 3622.00s]  Do you remember kick the tree?
[3622.00s -> 3628.30s]  You love that game, Marius.
[3628.30s -> 3629.26s]  All right, let's get some ore.
[3633.28s -> 3635.28s]  No, that's not right.
[3635.28s -> 3640.92s]  The green ring you see is the extent of your influence.
[3640.92s -> 3641.48s]  Oh, shit.
[3641.48s -> 3642.76s]  I need miners.
[3645.80s -> 3647.23s]  How much ore do I have?
[3647.23s -> 3647.71s]  Is it?
[3647.71s -> 3648.35s]  How much ore do I have?
[3648.35s -> 3649.47s]  Let me go to my stockpile.
[3650.27s -> 3651.07s]  I got a lot.
[3651.07s -> 3652.67s]  How much do I get ore?
[3652.67s -> 3654.03s]  I'm full on wood.
[3654.91s -> 3656.48s]  Wait.
[3657.34s -> 3658.80s]  Okay, that's good.
[3660.08s -> 3664.00s]  Gee, the people can be slow at building, boys.
[3664.00s -> 3666.00s]  We should do some god building.
[3666.00s -> 3668.32s]  You know, they were speeding up.
[3668.32s -> 3669.36s]  That is sweet.
[3670.32s -> 3673.21s]  All right, now we can make warriors.
[3673.21s -> 3676.49s]  They're recruited via the flags on the top of the armory.
[3676.49s -> 3678.81s]  Pick up one of the flags on the armory.
[3678.81s -> 3681.05s]  Then place it in the highlighted area.
[3682.33s -> 3683.85s]  So I have to make war?
[3684.89s -> 3686.17s]  Make platoons?
[3686.17s -> 3688.25s]  Number of troops, number of melee.
[3688.25s -> 3689.37s]  It's melee.
[3689.37s -> 3690.89s]  God, I know how to say that word.
[3696.59s -> 3697.07s]  Oh, shit.
[3697.07s -> 3697.23s]  Okay.
[3697.23s -> 3700.83s]  Dropping the flag will make a standard size platoon.
[3700.83s -> 3704.51s]  To recruit a larger platoon, hold down the action button.
[3704.51s -> 3706.67s]  Then drag away from the flag.
[3706.67s -> 3710.11s]  You can make a huge army so you can just drag this gigantic area.
[3711.15s -> 3712.67s]  Wait, why are you coming over here?
[3712.67s -> 3713.63s]  I didn't tell you to come over here.
[3715.31s -> 3717.79s]  Boy, too many people want to be warriors.
[3717.79s -> 3720.83s]  Wait, don't I have to tell you to be a warrior?
[3720.83s -> 3723.31s]  All right, are you sure you guys don't want to be farmers?
[3728.49s -> 3729.53s]  Oh, God.
[3729.53s -> 3729.85s]  Okay.
[3734.86s -> 3735.82s]  I can't click it.
[3736.70s -> 3738.28s]  Where are they going?
[3738.84s -> 3742.25s]  These are the best thing ever.
[3742.25s -> 3744.89s]  But you're going to need to keep them under control.
[3744.89s -> 3748.89s]  So you need to know all about these here flags.
[3748.89s -> 3750.97s]  Every platoon has a flag.
[3750.97s -> 3753.69s]  You can see it held up high above the army.
[3753.69s -> 3756.89s]  And also in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
[3756.89s -> 3758.01s]  This is an armory tab.
[3758.01s -> 3761.37s]  Each platoon type has a different color and symbol on their flag.
[3761.37s -> 3763.69s]  To make them easy to identify.
[3763.77s -> 3766.17s]  This one is a swordsman platoon.
[3766.17s -> 3769.77s]  The flags also tell you what rank the platoon is.
[3769.77s -> 3775.85s]  Those pips along the top indicate the rank from raw recruits to seasoned veterans.
[3775.85s -> 3779.77s]  If you click on the flags in the bottom right with the action button,
[3779.77s -> 3783.21s]  you pick up the flag and gain control of the platoon.
[3783.21s -> 3783.61s]  Okay.
[3783.61s -> 3788.33s]  Click on the flag with the move button and you'll go directly to the platoon.
[3788.33s -> 3789.85s]  And there you have it.
[3789.85s -> 3792.25s]  The basics of army flags.
[3793.21s -> 3795.05s]  Pick up the platoon flag, boys.
[3795.85s -> 3797.45s]  Pick up the platoon flag.
[3797.45s -> 3799.53s]  Health 120 to 20.
[3799.53s -> 3804.64s]  That's kind of in a weird spot for a platoon here.
[3807.36s -> 3808.40s]  Let's go.
[3808.40s -> 3810.00s]  That's perfect.
[3810.00s -> 3813.44s]  Click on the highlighted area to tell them to go there.
[3813.44s -> 3816.80s]  If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand,
[3816.80s -> 3819.04s]  simply shake his brisket left and right.
[3819.04s -> 3820.80s]  So I don't have to have influence over here.
[3821.52s -> 3822.48s]  That's kind of a big deal.
[3823.84s -> 3832.92s]  I don't have to have influence?
[3836.16s -> 3838.64s]  So I can just make a ton of people and just go conquer towns.
[3839.37s -> 3840.57s]  They just go where I can't.
[3840.57s -> 3843.80s]  That's so awesome.
[3843.80s -> 3845.56s]  Actually having control over what they do.
[3846.20s -> 3853.80s]  Because remember last time it was if you were outside,
[3853.80s -> 3856.68s]  it was like I had to throw people to gain access to be able.
[3856.68s -> 3859.50s]  It was that's a much needed change.
[3861.12s -> 3863.68s]  I had to throw that one unkillable guy around the map.
[3876.70s -> 3878.30s]  Do I want to do this by force?
[3878.30s -> 3879.82s]  I guess it's just teaching me how this works.
[3883.68s -> 3884.88s]  All right, where are we going?
[3885.52s -> 3887.44s]  Didn't these people all just come over willingly?
[3888.32s -> 3890.96s]  Everyone just came over here.
[3891.76s -> 3894.88s]  This is an empty town.
[3903.24s -> 3903.80s]  They're coming?
[3907.20s -> 3908.48s]  Raise it to the ground.
[3908.48s -> 3909.44s]  There's nothing to raise.
[3909.44s -> 3912.16s]  It's just a few houses in a temple.
[3925.18s -> 3926.38s]  They eat twice the food?
[3930.65s -> 3931.69s]  Oh god, here they come.
[3932.49s -> 3943.93s]  How do I put the flag down like that?
[3943.93s -> 3946.08s]  All right guys, do what you do.
[3946.08s -> 3948.40s]  Diplomacy first, always.
[3962.64s -> 3963.84s]  Well, we're already doing this.
[3968.19s -> 3970.67s]  Take over town by impressing what?
[3970.67s -> 3971.79s]  Impressing the stones?
[3972.75s -> 3979.05s]  Impress them with how many soldiers you have.
[3983.64s -> 3985.40s]  I mean, that works, I guess.
[3987.58s -> 3988.54s]  How are we doing?
[3988.54s -> 3989.34s]  Do we need anything?
[3993.12s -> 3993.60s]  Homes?
[3995.39s -> 3996.35s]  We need some houses.
[3996.35s -> 3998.03s]  Okay, we're going to get some houses.
[3998.75s -> 4001.05s]  We need some villa.
[4006.80s -> 4007.84s]  I know this is terrible.
[4007.84s -> 4008.80s]  It sucks, but who cares?
[4011.36s -> 4012.24s]  We're going to do two more.
[4012.24s -> 4013.36s]  I know it's terrible.
[4013.36s -> 4014.48s]  I know, trust me.
[4014.48s -> 4015.20s]  I'm the one making it.
[4015.20s -> 4016.56s]  You don't think I know it's horrible?
[4017.20s -> 4019.40s]  We'll do like three more houses.
[4019.40s -> 4025.14s]  That's fine.
[4026.24s -> 4027.76s]  Do they get it?
[4039.04s -> 4039.92s]  Dermot the bomb.
[4039.92s -> 4041.28s]  Dermot, he has earpods in.
[4042.40s -> 4043.76s]  Oh shit, I can't hear you.
[4044.72s -> 4047.74s]  And so what?
[4047.74s -> 4049.50s]  Do I just gain influence?
[4049.50s -> 4054.52s]  I can't hear it.
[4055.24s -> 4056.84s]  Impressiveness required to capture.
[4059.85s -> 4061.53s]  There's 19 people still here.
[4061.53s -> 4062.09s]  That's weird.
[4062.89s -> 4069.40s]  Oh, and there we go.
[4069.40s -> 4069.90s]  We got it.
[4070.60s -> 4073.52s]  Hooray.
[4074.30s -> 4076.94s]  Now where are they going?
[4076.94s -> 4080.54s]  More followers for our glorious war machine.
[4080.54s -> 4082.86s]  Yeah, now you own this town.
[4083.26s -> 4085.98s]  You can do anything in the great influence ring,
[4085.98s -> 4087.42s]  just like in your town.
[4087.42s -> 4088.22s]  That's what I need.
[4088.22s -> 4090.54s]  Attack is the best form of defense.
[4090.54s -> 4092.30s]  Get your armies out there.
[4092.30s -> 4093.02s]  I adore it.
[4093.02s -> 4097.02s]  A newly created platoon starts at experience level one.
[4097.02s -> 4099.98s]  Unless they fight, they gain experience.
[4099.98s -> 4103.66s]  When the platoon's experience reaches a certain threshold,
[4103.66s -> 4105.90s]  they go up to the next experience level
[4105.90s -> 4110.46s]  and with it, their skills such as fighting and speed improve.
[4111.18s -> 4114.54s]  Lastly, if you want to disband the platoon,
[4114.54s -> 4117.42s]  drop the platoon's flag onto an armory
[4117.42s -> 4119.34s]  and let those weaklings off the hook.
[4119.98s -> 4120.38s]  Oh, that.
[4120.38s -> 4122.94s]  OK, so they can go back to being regular.
[4122.94s -> 4123.44s]  OK.
[4125.16s -> 4129.64s]  You see, you can win by taking over towns using force
[4129.64s -> 4132.92s]  or by impressing the people in those other towns.
[4132.92s -> 4133.80s]  Need a builder over here.
[4133.80s -> 4135.64s]  War solves everything.
[4135.64s -> 4136.76s]  How many of you guys are farmers?
[4136.76s -> 4137.26s]  Build.
[4137.26s -> 4140.84s]  You can win by a mixture of impressing and war.
[4140.84s -> 4141.56s]  They're all breeders.
[4142.12s -> 4146.36s]  Alas, the time of innocence draws to a close.
[4146.36s -> 4149.40s]  You must take a step down the road of good.
[4151.45s -> 4156.25s]  And by the way, war is evil and I'm evil.
[4156.25s -> 4158.09s]  You get where I'm coming from.
[4158.09s -> 4159.61s]  Time to choose, boys.
[4159.61s -> 4160.41s]  Time to choose?
[4161.93s -> 4164.01s]  Take over every town on the land.
[4167.37s -> 4168.09s]  Oh, shit.
[4168.09s -> 4169.21s]  I got to take these two over.
[4174.30s -> 4174.78s]  Be good.
[4174.78s -> 4175.26s]  Be evil.
[4175.26s -> 4175.66s]  Be good.
[4175.66s -> 4176.14s]  Be evil.
[4176.14s -> 4176.70s]  Be evil.
[4177.96s -> 4181.10s]  Um, well, hold on.
[4182.62s -> 4184.22s]  Oh, it's time to awaken.
[4184.94s -> 4186.94s]  It's time to, but not yet.
[4186.94s -> 4187.34s]  Not yet.
[4187.34s -> 4187.82s]  Not yet.
[4187.82s -> 4189.98s]  Let's let the fucking hype build a little more.
[4191.53s -> 4195.93s]  Another important part of the toolbar is the objectives menu.
[4195.93s -> 4198.73s]  Select the objectives tab to open it.
[4198.73s -> 4199.92s]  F2?
[4201.42s -> 4201.92s]  F1?
[4202.78s -> 4203.42s]  It's not F2.
[4203.42s -> 4203.82s]  What is it?
[4205.18s -> 4206.49s]  Objectives tab?
[4208.51s -> 4209.23s]  Right.
[4209.23s -> 4212.03s]  Here you can find all the important tasks
[4212.03s -> 4214.19s]  that will enable you to complete a land.
[4214.19s -> 4217.47s]  And also some less important tasks that are just interesting.
[4217.47s -> 4218.59s]  We're almost there.
[4218.59s -> 4222.75s]  The tabs at the bottom right control which objectives you are looking at.
[4222.75s -> 4223.31s]  Oh, that's cool.
[4223.31s -> 4226.03s]  Either all of them or a selection from the total.
[4226.03s -> 4230.75s]  The objectives window up in the top left also displays the objectives.
[4230.75s -> 4234.99s]  You only need to complete the gold scroll objective to complete the land.
[4234.99s -> 4235.23s]  Okay.
[4235.23s -> 4239.31s]  But you earn more tribute by undertaking some of the other ones.
[4239.31s -> 4239.63s]  Yeah.
[4239.63s -> 4240.27s]  Yes.
[4240.27s -> 4243.63s]  You earn tribute for every objective you complete.
[4243.63s -> 4244.59s]  Oh, the side quest?
[4244.59s -> 4245.63s]  They call it the gold scroll.
[4246.75s -> 4247.55s]  I'm not clicking on...
[4247.55s -> 4248.35s]  No, I don't want to do that yet.
[4248.35s -> 4249.47s]  There's like this...
[4249.47s -> 4250.03s]  All this stuff.
[4251.92s -> 4252.16s]  All right.
[4252.16s -> 4252.80s]  That's good to know.
[4253.60s -> 4258.72s]  As our city grows, the greater the distance our villagers will have to travel.
[4258.72s -> 4262.48s]  To aid their little feet, we can build roads.
[4262.48s -> 4268.16s]  To build a road, grab an existing road by holding down the action button.
[4268.16s -> 4271.20s]  Then drag out the shape of the road you want.
[4271.20s -> 4273.92s]  When you are happy with it, click the action button.
[4274.56s -> 4276.00s]  So you got to build roads first.
[4276.64s -> 4278.56s]  And then you block out the town.
[4278.56s -> 4278.96s]  Yeah.
[4278.96s -> 4279.28s]  Okay.
[4279.84s -> 4281.60s]  Have a go at building a road.
[4281.60s -> 4281.92s]  All right.
[4281.92s -> 4282.24s]  All right.
[4282.24s -> 4283.20s]  Well, I need to have...
[4283.20s -> 4286.00s]  We'll just have this connected here because it's tutorial.
[4286.64s -> 4291.52s]  Whatever.
[4291.52s -> 4292.24s]  Who cares?
[4298.19s -> 4299.84s]  Doesn't matter.
[4299.84s -> 4300.96s]  I had to do that just to keep...
[4300.96s -> 4302.64s]  Oh, that looks really bad.
[4304.08s -> 4306.48s]  From a satellite, that looks really bad.
[4306.48s -> 4307.60s]  It doesn't matter.
[4307.60s -> 4308.56s]  This is level one.
[4308.56s -> 4310.32s]  We'll block out the next complete village.
[4310.32s -> 4312.48s]  We haven't even woken up the creature yet, so we're good.
[4312.48s -> 4315.00s]  All right.
[4315.00s -> 4316.04s]  What's this side quest?
[4316.76s -> 4322.00s]  What does it do?
[4322.00s -> 4323.28s]  Drunk city builder.
[4327.44s -> 4328.32s]  Hey, you!
[4328.32s -> 4329.60s]  Great God!
[4329.60s -> 4332.08s]  If you exist, I know you can hear me.
[4332.08s -> 4334.40s]  My daughter's fallen pregnant.
[4334.40s -> 4336.48s]  She says no man has touched her.
[4336.48s -> 4338.56s]  It's an immaculate conception.
[4338.56s -> 4340.72s]  So it must be down to you.
[4340.72s -> 4343.20s]  You are responsible for the child.
[4343.20s -> 4346.00s]  Pay me a dowry of 1,000 wood.
[4346.80s -> 4351.12s]  I have no idea how this happened.
[4353.90s -> 4355.34s]  How does she get pregnant?
[4355.34s -> 4357.50s]  She's having sex to my left.
[4357.50s -> 4361.18s]  Whoever is responsible and clear your good name.
[4361.18s -> 4363.26s]  Something is amiss here, lead out.
[4363.26s -> 4363.90s]  That was ridiculous.
[4363.90s -> 4365.90s]  Maybe you should see where she's going.
[4366.94s -> 4372.33s]  Where is she going?
[4374.73s -> 4375.93s]  Something is amiss?
[4386.20s -> 4387.24s]  What are we doing?
[4387.96s -> 4391.77s]  Clean up those ants.
[4391.77s -> 4392.65s]  There's bugs everywhere.
[4393.45s -> 4394.81s]  Who left out like a can of food?
[4394.81s -> 4395.21s]  Come on.
[4396.01s -> 4412.04s]  I don't know.
[4412.04s -> 4414.20s]  I don't know if that was scripted enough, but that was fucking funny.
[4415.16s -> 4416.91s]  Who's playing the automaton?
[4420.48s -> 4420.88s]  All right.
[4420.88s -> 4421.12s]  How?
[4422.00s -> 4423.90s]  Watch out.
[4423.90s -> 4424.62s]  The person has an axe.
[4425.34s -> 4427.64s]  Click on the gold scroll.
[4428.36s -> 4429.72s]  No, I'm busy.
[4435.37s -> 4436.33s]  New follow quest.
[4436.33s -> 4437.53s]  I don't care if this is two hours.
[4438.41s -> 4443.52s]  At least I don't have to be behind her.
[4444.24s -> 4447.87s]  Where are you going?
[4448.59s -> 4449.23s]  All the way?
[4449.23s -> 4451.79s]  Are you walking all the way to one of these houses?
[4451.79s -> 4452.03s]  Okay.
[4452.75s -> 4468.08s]  Oh my God.
[4469.04s -> 4469.20s]  What?
[4478.64s -> 4479.84s]  She's going right over here.
[4480.48s -> 4490.80s]  Why do I feel like one of these random townspeople is going to just throw something at her?
[4490.80s -> 4491.84s]  Or like a attacker or something.
[4491.84s -> 4493.36s]  They keep walking over here menacingly.
[4495.29s -> 4496.09s]  Where are you going?
[4496.81s -> 4501.45s]  I don't know why there's so many bugs.
[4501.45s -> 4501.93s]  I don't know.
[4502.73s -> 4506.20s]  Here we go.
[4507.00s -> 4509.77s]  It's because the houses were so far away.
[4510.57s -> 4512.17s]  This is the home of the community.
[4512.17s -> 4516.03s]  You had to walk across the whole town pregnant.
[4516.83s -> 4519.85s]  This is like scale it back.
[4519.85s -> 4521.21s]  This is like probably 10 miles.
[4522.09s -> 4526.86s]  This is like at least four to five miles is scaled.
[4530.83s -> 4531.15s]  Okay.
[4531.71s -> 4534.97s]  So now what?
[4535.13s -> 4544.60s]  Is she going to be like you're the dad or something?
[4544.60s -> 4545.56s]  Hello handsome.
[4547.02s -> 4549.42s]  I know something was going on.
[4549.42s -> 4551.40s]  No such thing.
[4551.40s -> 4551.56s]  What?
[4551.56s -> 4553.88s]  Someone ought to let her father know about this.
[4555.84s -> 4556.64s]  I don't understand.
[4557.52s -> 4558.08s]  Hold on.
[4558.08s -> 4559.68s]  She's like she's pregnant.
[4568.59s -> 4569.31s]  How is she?
[4569.31s -> 4569.63s]  Okay.
[4569.63s -> 4574.67s]  She's having she's having sex while like nine months pregnant?
[4577.42s -> 4577.74s]  What?
[4579.34s -> 4582.94s]  Wait, what the fuck?
[4583.66s -> 4585.13s]  Where's the okay?
[4585.13s -> 4586.33s]  Where is this guy?
[4586.33s -> 4587.93s]  He was in the other community.
[4587.93s -> 4591.28s]  What community was he in?
[4591.28s -> 4591.68s]  This one?
[4607.96s -> 4608.52s]  Uh hey.
[4611.08s -> 4611.88s]  I got something for you.
[4612.44s -> 4612.68s]  You?
[4613.56s -> 4614.33s]  Hello?
[4615.29s -> 4615.93s]  Can I talk to you?
[4617.61s -> 4620.94s]  Uh I was gonna bring you over here.
[4621.58s -> 4635.88s]  No come here.
[4636.92s -> 4645.71s]  It took too long.
[4645.71s -> 4645.95s]  What?
[4646.67s -> 4651.82s]  No I didn't.
[4656.25s -> 4659.34s]  He's already gone.
[4660.22s -> 4662.81s]  You have to put him in the chimney.
[4669.20s -> 4670.24s]  She's walking away?
[4672.80s -> 4673.36s]  Oh shit.
[4673.36s -> 4673.92s]  There she is.
[4673.92s -> 4674.16s]  All right.
[4674.16s -> 4674.48s]  Hold on.
[4674.48s -> 4674.80s]  Wait, wait.
[4684.65s -> 4685.61s]  No look.
[4685.61s -> 4687.07s]  It's all right.
[4687.07s -> 4688.03s]  She'll do it again.
[4688.03s -> 4695.88s]  It's all right.
[4695.88s -> 4696.92s]  She'll go back.
[4696.92s -> 4698.17s]  It's all right.
[4698.17s -> 4701.74s]  Oh we need ore.
[4702.30s -> 4703.18s]  How many people are in the mine?
[4704.76s -> 4705.24s]  Zero.
[4705.24s -> 4705.48s]  What?
[4708.35s -> 4710.43s]  Disciple mine worker.
[4710.43s -> 4712.94s]  Disciple mine.
[4712.94s -> 4713.58s]  Oh no, no, no.
[4713.58s -> 4714.78s]  You you keep doing your thing.
[4715.50s -> 4722.11s]  Disciple mine.
[4722.11s -> 4722.83s]  All right.
[4722.83s -> 4723.95s]  We'll go back to that quest.
[4724.59s -> 4725.15s]  It's gonna happen.
[4725.15s -> 4727.07s]  Just remind me that it's happening and I will catch it.
[4728.24s -> 4730.08s]  Click on the gold scroll.
[4730.08s -> 4731.52s]  It's time to awaken Murius.
[4732.16s -> 4740.17s]  Creature's waking up.
[4743.16s -> 4746.92s]  And it was a long sleep but here we are.
[4750.76s -> 4754.68s]  Ah I'm over here.
[4765.16s -> 4766.36s]  He's scared.
[4766.36s -> 4767.88s]  He doesn't want to leave the pen.
[4768.84s -> 4769.48s]  Why are you scared?
[4770.44s -> 4773.00s]  Let's use the leash to get him to move.
[4773.00s -> 4773.32s]  Okay.
[4773.32s -> 4777.48s]  To grab the leash click on the creature with the action button
[4777.48s -> 4780.60s]  or you can just press the L key.
[4780.60s -> 4781.32s]  Okay.
[4781.32s -> 4783.00s]  Grab the creature's leash.
[4783.80s -> 4784.28s]  Here we go.
[4785.32s -> 4788.12s]  He's been in the pen for ages.
[4788.12s -> 4790.68s]  Make him come outside for a bit.
[4790.68s -> 4795.00s]  Move him outside by clicking the action button once on the ground.
[4796.12s -> 4797.08s]  Excellent.
[4797.08s -> 4801.72s]  With your creature on the leash you can move him or get him to do things.
[4801.72s -> 4804.76s]  And more importantly to do what you want him to do.
[4804.76s -> 4806.20s]  Oh my god.
[4806.20s -> 4807.72s]  Why are you so slow?
[4808.76s -> 4811.72s]  He slept like a hundred years?
[4813.93s -> 4814.17s]  Well.
[4815.58s -> 4816.62s]  Well done.
[4816.62s -> 4819.02s]  That's how you get the creature to move.
[4819.02s -> 4820.86s]  The creature's hungry.
[4820.86s -> 4821.74s]  Let's feed him.
[4822.78s -> 4823.18s]  Okay.
[4823.18s -> 4823.66s]  What do you want?
[4824.62s -> 4825.26s]  Food?
[4825.26s -> 4825.66s]  Grain?
[4825.66s -> 4827.98s]  With the leash in the hand click on the field.
[4829.80s -> 4830.52s]  Don't get grain.
[4831.08s -> 4831.72s]  Here it comes.
[4832.28s -> 4833.48s]  I'm going to get that grain.
[4836.30s -> 4836.62s]  Yes.
[4837.85s -> 4838.17s]  Eat it.
[4838.89s -> 4839.69s]  It's delicious.
[4841.40s -> 4842.36s]  That's better.
[4842.36s -> 4844.52s]  He doesn't look as hungry now.
[4844.52s -> 4848.96s]  When click the action button on something with the leash the creature will try.
[4848.96s -> 4850.32s]  He ate the entire field?
[4851.12s -> 4856.64s]  Double click the action button on that rock by the field and he will be leashed to it.
[4859.71s -> 4860.27s]  That's right.
[4860.91s -> 4861.47s]  Marvelous.
[4861.47s -> 4862.83s]  Does the leash actually work in this game?
[4864.11s -> 4869.77s]  You should now teach your creature whether what he does is good or bad.
[4869.77s -> 4871.05s]  Should I eat a villager?
[4871.05s -> 4871.93s]  Oh dear.
[4871.93s -> 4873.69s]  He's going to eat a villager.
[4873.69s -> 4876.17s]  You should teach him not to do that.
[4876.17s -> 4877.53s]  Nonsense.
[4877.53s -> 4880.49s]  Eating villagers will make him strong.
[4880.49s -> 4883.05s]  Click and hold the action button on him.
[4883.05s -> 4887.93s]  Move the mouse quickly from side to side to punish him for eating that person.
[4887.93s -> 4889.13s]  He didn't eat anybody yet.
[4889.13s -> 4890.97s]  Move the mouse slowly.
[4890.97s -> 4893.05s]  Pet him and reward him.
[4893.05s -> 4895.53s]  Eating people is fine by me you see.
[4895.53s -> 4896.49s]  He didn't eat anybody.
[4897.05s -> 4898.57s]  He has not eaten this person.
[4899.21s -> 4900.81s]  So he hasn't done anything wrong.
[4902.01s -> 4903.69s]  You haven't done anything wrong yet.
[4903.69s -> 4905.13s]  Why would I discipline you?
[4905.13s -> 4906.01s]  Just pick somebody up.
[4907.44s -> 4908.00s]  All right.
[4908.00s -> 4908.40s]  You're good.
[4909.36s -> 4912.92s]  I'll sometimes choose to eat a villager.
[4912.92s -> 4914.04s]  What do you mean sometimes?
[4917.98s -> 4919.74s]  It's sensitive.
[4919.74s -> 4919.98s]  Wait.
[4919.98s -> 4921.18s]  I'll often choose.
[4921.18s -> 4921.82s]  No, no, no, no.
[4921.82s -> 4923.74s]  Don't often choose to eat a villager.
[4924.86s -> 4925.34s]  How do I?
[4927.12s -> 4928.08s]  That was horrible.
[4929.20s -> 4930.00s]  Oh my god.
[4930.00s -> 4930.80s]  I knocked him down.
[4931.52s -> 4936.27s]  What is he doing?
[4936.99s -> 4938.67s]  Oh my god.
[4938.67s -> 4939.55s]  That's so bad.
[4940.43s -> 4943.95s]  You're on the road to making a nasty creature.
[4944.03s -> 4946.67s]  What a senseless waste of human life.
[4946.67s -> 4950.03s]  If you want to cancel an action and empty your hand,
[4950.03s -> 4952.59s]  simply shake it briskly left and right.
[4952.59s -> 4956.11s]  That is just about everything you need to know right now.
[4956.11s -> 4958.83s]  Why don't you try experimenting with your creature?
[4959.95s -> 4960.27s]  Okay.
[4960.27s -> 4961.71s]  Let's experiment.
[4961.71s -> 4962.67s]  What do you think is over here?
[4962.67s -> 4963.47s]  Can you pick this up?
[4964.27s -> 4964.59s]  Try.
[4965.69s -> 4966.89s]  I can't do that.
[4973.79s -> 4975.71s]  I'm going to eat snack on that grain.
[4975.71s -> 4976.91s]  No, stop eating the grain.
[4980.64s -> 4981.76s]  You eat too much grain.
[4982.48s -> 4984.38s]  Oh my god.
[4984.38s -> 4985.26s]  Can he eat bugs?
[4985.90s -> 4986.56s]  Wait.
[4986.56s -> 4987.04s]  Come over here.
[4987.04s -> 4987.84s]  Eat the bugs.
[4987.84s -> 4989.92s]  Can you play with the bugs or eat the bugs or something?
[4991.87s -> 4992.51s]  Wait.
[4992.51s -> 4996.22s]  Pick up this rock.
[4996.22s -> 4997.42s]  I have to teach you.
[4997.42s -> 5002.68s]  Pick up rock.
[5003.32s -> 5005.10s]  Okay.
[5005.66s -> 5005.90s]  Good.
[5006.46s -> 5007.52s]  Very good.
[5008.59s -> 5009.55s]  Do not eat rock.
[5009.55s -> 5010.67s]  He's learning.
[5010.67s -> 5012.59s]  He's getting inquisitive.
[5015.24s -> 5015.48s]  Okay.
[5016.73s -> 5018.41s]  Now you figure out what you want to do with it.
[5019.21s -> 5022.65s]  Okay.
[5022.65s -> 5023.21s]  Put it down.
[5024.25s -> 5025.05s]  Very good.
[5025.05s -> 5025.29s]  All right.
[5025.29s -> 5025.85s]  What about the?
[5026.65s -> 5032.84s]  I had enough for today.
[5036.46s -> 5036.78s]  Okay.
[5037.66s -> 5039.58s]  Well, that was a lot for one day.
[5040.22s -> 5041.18s]  This is a rock.
[5041.18s -> 5042.46s]  That's enough for one day.
[5042.46s -> 5043.26s]  Food coma.
[5044.14s -> 5045.50s]  All right.
[5045.50s -> 5046.06s]  How are we doing?
[5050.30s -> 5051.34s]  People want to sleep.
[5051.98s -> 5053.47s]  Do I not have enough houses?
[5056.80s -> 5057.60s]  So let them sleep.
[5058.96s -> 5061.72s]  All right.
[5061.72s -> 5062.52s]  What about the daughter?
[5064.51s -> 5065.07s]  There he is.
[5065.79s -> 5066.27s]  Where is she?
[5067.07s -> 5073.32s]  Because look for the pregnant lady going.
[5074.04s -> 5076.08s]  Okay.
[5076.08s -> 5076.88s]  We missed it.
[5076.88s -> 5077.68s]  We got to do it again.
[5080.46s -> 5082.16s]  Oh, he's up.
[5082.88s -> 5087.64s]  Where are you going?
[5088.44s -> 5089.56s]  I want you to learn.
[5089.56s -> 5090.60s]  I want you to do things.
[5091.32s -> 5092.04s]  I want you to.
[5092.04s -> 5092.76s]  Why are you so?
[5092.76s -> 5093.88s]  Why is his stomach so big?
[5094.76s -> 5101.95s]  Just kind of doing a perimeter.
[5103.23s -> 5106.12s]  Look at how fat the stomach is.
[5106.84s -> 5112.43s]  Is he blowing a kiss?
[5113.76s -> 5114.96s]  He's so wonderful.
[5115.92s -> 5116.80s]  I could enter.
[5116.80s -> 5118.16s]  I could entertain some villagers.
[5118.16s -> 5118.40s]  Yeah.
[5118.40s -> 5118.80s]  Do that.
[5120.56s -> 5121.68s]  Entertain the villagers.
[5129.44s -> 5131.20s]  How is this entertaining a villager?
[5135.29s -> 5136.73s]  He's like smelling them.
[5137.93s -> 5140.17s]  I am going to play with that villager.
[5140.17s -> 5140.65s]  Okay.
[5140.65s -> 5141.13s]  Cool.
[5141.13s -> 5145.10s]  You good work.
[5147.98s -> 5148.46s]  I did.
[5148.46s -> 5149.10s]  I had fun.
[5149.10s -> 5149.42s]  Bye.
[5151.10s -> 5152.14s]  He just wanted to smell him.
[5153.42s -> 5153.82s]  Bugs.
[5153.82s -> 5154.14s]  Yes.
[5154.70s -> 5155.18s]  Very good.
[5160.08s -> 5161.04s]  Everybody loves him.
[5161.60s -> 5163.48s]  Good job.
[5164.65s -> 5165.13s]  Yeah.
[5165.13s -> 5165.61s]  Very.
[5165.61s -> 5166.65s]  No, I'm trying to pet him.
[5168.92s -> 5169.56s]  Good job.
[5169.56s -> 5170.68s]  Entertain the villagers.
[5177.02s -> 5177.18s]  All right.
[5177.18s -> 5177.66s]  Let's do.
[5177.66s -> 5178.54s]  Now we have to take.
[5178.54s -> 5178.86s]  All right.
[5178.86s -> 5179.82s]  He he'll be fine.
[5179.82s -> 5180.38s]  He's going to learn.
[5181.10s -> 5182.75s]  I need more houses.
[5183.31s -> 5185.71s]  Let's see.
[5185.71s -> 5185.87s]  Right.
[5185.87s -> 5186.91s]  For creature.
[5186.91s -> 5188.70s]  I'm starving.
[5188.70s -> 5188.94s]  Fuck.
[5190.62s -> 5192.72s]  How much grain is here?
[5193.36s -> 5196.27s]  All right.
[5196.27s -> 5196.51s]  Here.
[5196.51s -> 5197.07s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5198.03s -> 5199.36s]  Take some of this.
[5200.08s -> 5203.08s]  What are you doing over here?
[5206.17s -> 5207.04s]  What are you doing?
[5215.21s -> 5215.69s]  What is he?
[5215.69s -> 5216.73s]  Is he bringing this?
[5216.73s -> 5217.93s]  Where are you bringing this tree?
[5230.24s -> 5231.44s]  So pointless.
[5231.44s -> 5233.20s]  Wait, what are you going to eat this?
[5233.20s -> 5233.76s]  No, no, no, no.
[5233.76s -> 5234.72s]  Eat this instead.
[5234.72s -> 5235.52s]  Eat that instead.
[5236.56s -> 5236.96s]  No, no, no.
[5236.96s -> 5237.84s]  Eat this instead.
[5237.84s -> 5239.28s]  Hey, hey, leash, leash, leash, leash.
[5239.28s -> 5239.68s]  Eat this.
[5240.32s -> 5241.26s]  Eat the grain.
[5243.90s -> 5244.38s]  Eat that.
[5245.02s -> 5248.24s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5248.24s -> 5248.72s]  Eat this.
[5251.32s -> 5252.60s]  Why did he pick up the tree?
[5253.48s -> 5256.36s]  He picked up the tree and gave the tree as a present
[5256.36s -> 5257.32s]  to one of the villagers.
[5258.12s -> 5258.44s]  Eat it.
[5259.56s -> 5259.96s]  Eat that.
[5260.60s -> 5261.08s]  Isn't it good?
[5263.42s -> 5264.46s]  Yeah, it is.
[5264.46s -> 5266.60s]  I'm going to...
[5266.60s -> 5267.16s]  What does it say?
[5268.20s -> 5269.88s]  I'm going to play with that villager.
[5269.88s -> 5270.36s]  All right.
[5270.36s -> 5271.48s]  What do I do with this tree?
[5271.48s -> 5272.44s]  Oh, somebody already picked it up.
[5272.44s -> 5272.92s]  Okay, good.
[5276.91s -> 5278.11s]  ADHD cow.
[5278.11s -> 5278.43s]  Yeah.
[5278.43s -> 5280.67s]  That's so much fun just to watch him grow.
[5281.55s -> 5284.91s]  He wants to play with...
[5288.27s -> 5289.63s]  This person's not interested at all.
[5290.27s -> 5292.11s]  All right.
[5293.15s -> 5294.03s]  The pregnant lady.
[5294.91s -> 5295.31s]  There she goes.
[5295.31s -> 5295.87s]  All right.
[5295.87s -> 5296.27s]  We're ready.
[5297.58s -> 5298.62s]  Now I'm going to...
[5298.62s -> 5299.18s]  Hold on.
[5299.18s -> 5299.74s]  What do I need to do?
[5299.74s -> 5300.30s]  I need to build...
[5301.26s -> 5303.39s]  I need to build something else.
[5303.39s -> 5306.81s]  Where's he going?
[5306.81s -> 5308.32s]  Why is he picking up trees?
[5309.60s -> 5310.40s]  Why is he doing this?
[5312.20s -> 5313.00s]  What's the logic here?
[5313.00s -> 5314.20s]  Is he trying to plant trees
[5314.20s -> 5316.12s]  or he's giving trees to people?
[5318.17s -> 5318.65s]  I'm going...
[5319.37s -> 5320.65s]  I'm dead.
[5320.65s -> 5320.89s]  What?
[5321.69s -> 5324.68s]  What is he doing?
[5325.32s -> 5330.62s]  That's the wrong store.
[5331.26s -> 5335.29s]  That's not...
[5335.29s -> 5336.01s]  That's incorrect.
[5337.02s -> 5338.46s]  I know he's trying to help, but...
[5339.10s -> 5340.86s]  He's locked himself in here.
[5344.43s -> 5345.95s]  That's not correct.
[5345.95s -> 5346.27s]  All right.
[5346.27s -> 5347.15s]  You tried though.
[5347.15s -> 5347.71s]  Good try.
[5347.71s -> 5348.19s]  You tried.
[5349.24s -> 5349.80s]  You tried.
[5352.28s -> 5352.84s]  Nice work.
[5353.80s -> 5355.56s]  Thank you for trying.
[5357.32s -> 5358.20s]  He's just a baby.
[5358.20s -> 5358.84s]  He doesn't know.
[5364.62s -> 5365.74s]  He didn't eat anybody.
[5370.72s -> 5370.96s]  Okay.
[5372.43s -> 5373.39s]  What was I doing?
[5373.39s -> 5374.19s]  I'm too distracted.
[5374.83s -> 5377.15s]  ADHD cow and ADHD streamer.
[5377.15s -> 5379.31s]  This is a horrible, horrible fucking combination.
[5379.95s -> 5381.90s]  All right.
[5382.62s -> 5383.71s]  All right.
[5383.71s -> 5384.99s]  Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady.
[5386.30s -> 5386.54s]  Come here.
[5392.91s -> 5393.39s]  Is she there?
[5393.87s -> 5394.43s]  Here she goes.
[5423.40s -> 5425.32s]  Entertain is equals eat.
[5425.32s -> 5425.96s]  What?
[5425.96s -> 5429.63s]  Here we go.
[5430.35s -> 5430.83s]  So now what?
[5430.83s -> 5431.87s]  Do I just put him down here
[5431.87s -> 5432.91s]  and knock on the door or...
[5433.79s -> 5436.96s]  I get 20,000 tribute for this.
[5441.69s -> 5442.81s]  Hello, handsome.
[5442.81s -> 5443.21s]  Here we go.
[5445.69s -> 5456.32s]  This way, that way.
[5456.32s -> 5456.96s]  This way, that way.
[5458.75s -> 5458.99s]  I...
[5459.71s -> 5461.79s]  I can't believe it.
[5461.79s -> 5462.83s]  I apologize.
[5463.79s -> 5466.99s]  I'm so sorry for accusing you wrongly.
[5466.99s -> 5470.27s]  I'll make sure the child is raised faithful and true to you.
[5472.76s -> 5473.24s]  So what...
[5474.20s -> 5475.00s]  That's all I had to do.
[5477.32s -> 5477.64s]  Okay.
[5478.52s -> 5479.48s]  That works.
[5486.43s -> 5489.23s]  That's 20,000 tribute.
[5489.23s -> 5489.71s]  What is he doing?
[5490.51s -> 5492.06s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[5492.06s -> 5492.46s]  What are you doing?
[5495.74s -> 5497.58s]  Shall I poo on that villager?
[5501.07s -> 5502.43s]  I don't think so.
[5503.23s -> 5503.71s]  Why?
[5507.47s -> 5510.75s]  Why would you do that?
[5510.75s -> 5512.75s]  Why would you even ask that question?
[5514.59s -> 5515.55s]  Should I...
[5515.55s -> 5517.47s]  I'm going to eat that villager.
[5517.47s -> 5518.99s]  First, you're going to shit on them,
[5518.99s -> 5521.15s]  but you decided you're going to eat them instead.
[5525.20s -> 5526.00s]  That's so rude.
[5526.00s -> 5526.24s]  Okay.
[5526.24s -> 5526.72s]  He doesn't know.
[5526.72s -> 5527.92s]  He's like fucked up.
[5528.72s -> 5529.82s]  Was he drunk?
[5535.60s -> 5536.24s]  Where are you going?
[5536.96s -> 5548.84s]  Gather from the fields?
[5548.84s -> 5549.08s]  Yes.
[5552.44s -> 5553.16s]  Get all...
[5553.16s -> 5553.56s]  Do that.
[5553.56s -> 5554.04s]  Yes.
[5554.04s -> 5555.16s]  Gather from the fields and put it in.
[5561.71s -> 5563.47s]  He can do it all in one go.
[5563.47s -> 5563.71s]  All right.
[5563.71s -> 5565.39s]  He's going to put it in the wood pile, isn't he?
[5567.50s -> 5567.98s]  Nope.
[5567.98s -> 5568.30s]  Good.
[5570.43s -> 5570.83s]  What's going on?
[5571.39s -> 5574.24s]  What's going on?
[5576.38s -> 5576.78s]  What do I hear?
[5576.78s -> 5577.10s]  Like a...
[5578.54s -> 5580.78s]  We're going to attack?
[5581.50s -> 5594.48s]  All right.
[5594.48s -> 5595.12s]  Go to bed.
[5595.12s -> 5595.84s]  Maybe he'll growl.
[5595.84s -> 5596.08s]  All right.
[5596.08s -> 5596.64s]  That's good.
[5596.64s -> 5597.12s]  I need to...
[5597.12s -> 5597.60s]  Wait a minute.
[5600.22s -> 5604.09s]  I'm just going to go kill these people.
[5604.09s -> 5604.81s]  What are we doing over here?
[5604.81s -> 5605.29s]  What do we need?
[5606.60s -> 5607.00s]  Sleep.
[5607.00s -> 5607.88s]  We need some more buildings.
[5609.53s -> 5610.41s]  Is the storeroom built?
[5610.41s -> 5611.13s]  The storeroom is built.
[5613.02s -> 5614.30s]  Everyone's just like kind of standing around.
[5616.27s -> 5617.79s]  Disciple farmer.
[5617.79s -> 5618.83s]  Guys, get some shit done.
[5619.79s -> 5621.07s]  Disciple farmer.
[5623.85s -> 5624.65s]  Oh, there's two more.
[5624.65s -> 5624.89s]  Okay.
[5624.89s -> 5625.45s]  We need wood.
[5626.41s -> 5633.64s]  Disciple forester.
[5633.64s -> 5634.67s]  Come here.
[5634.67s -> 5635.23s]  Pick this up.
[5635.23s -> 5635.55s]  Let's go.
[5636.73s -> 5638.33s]  For Valar.
[5638.33s -> 5639.69s]  What do we got over here?
[5639.69s -> 5640.33s]  We have...
[5640.33s -> 5640.89s]  Let me see.
[5641.69s -> 5644.78s]  Stay over here.
[5645.66s -> 5648.78s]  Because seriously, if they attack,
[5648.78s -> 5649.82s]  I want them to be right there.
[5650.62s -> 5654.75s]  I need trees.
[5655.55s -> 5657.60s]  Hold on.
[5657.60s -> 5657.92s]  Let me...
[5658.80s -> 5661.32s]  Let's build another house.
[5663.13s -> 5663.69s]  Forty...
[5663.69s -> 5664.57s]  How many people are here now?
[5665.13s -> 5665.69s]  A lot, right?
[5666.65s -> 5666.97s]  Yeah.
[5666.97s -> 5667.45s]  Let's do...
[5668.41s -> 5670.48s]  Just get another house here or whatever.
[5671.28s -> 5674.83s]  I have so much food.
[5674.83s -> 5675.07s]  You know what?
[5675.07s -> 5676.59s]  I'm going to take a bunch of this food.
[5676.59s -> 5680.76s]  I'm going to take like fucking 10,000.
[5681.40s -> 5682.57s]  They're not even eating it.
[5682.57s -> 5683.77s]  I'm bringing it over here.
[5683.77s -> 5690.86s]  That's evil?
[5690.86s -> 5691.58s]  I own the place.
[5692.14s -> 5695.28s]  What is he doing?
[5697.80s -> 5699.88s]  I'm going to have a dump on that villager's head.
[5704.16s -> 5705.60s]  Why do you keep saying this?
[5708.52s -> 5709.72s]  What is wrong with you?
[5710.84s -> 5712.52s]  He never does it though.
[5712.52s -> 5714.92s]  He always threatens to take a shit on somebody,
[5714.92s -> 5715.72s]  but he never does.
[5716.60s -> 5724.91s]  Should you poo on somebody?
[5725.87s -> 5726.83s]  Wait, we're going to scroll.
[5729.42s -> 5729.82s]  Come with me.
[5732.54s -> 5733.26s]  We're going to go...
[5733.26s -> 5733.98s]  I want you over here.
[5741.90s -> 5742.38s]  Can I...
[5742.38s -> 5743.50s]  Yeah, I want to take you...
[5743.50s -> 5744.30s]  Take a walk.
[5744.30s -> 5751.28s]  I want you to go impress these people over here.
[5751.28s -> 5752.24s]  You go explore.
[5753.63s -> 5754.59s]  Go learn some stuff.
[5756.78s -> 5757.90s]  Who needs homes?
[5757.90s -> 5761.12s]  My chat's all fucked up.
[5761.12s -> 5762.24s]  Hold on a second.
[5762.24s -> 5763.12s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5764.64s -> 5764.96s]  I want...
[5764.96s -> 5767.07s]  I need to save the goddamn game.
[5767.07s -> 5767.55s]  Holy shit.
[5767.55s -> 5768.59s]  That would have been a disaster.
[5768.59s -> 5771.07s]  Atma Starfish, thanks for the five community subs.
[5771.71s -> 5772.86s]  Create a new save.
[5773.42s -> 5782.24s]  Can you imagine two hours going by?
[5782.24s -> 5783.12s]  Take over the time.
[5783.12s -> 5785.29s]  All right, I'm ready.
[5785.29s -> 5785.77s]  Let's go.
[5792.30s -> 5793.34s]  How you doing?
[5793.34s -> 5800.59s]  It's nighttime, but there's no ore over here, though.
[5803.39s -> 5804.19s]  I need to get over...
[5804.19s -> 5804.59s]  All right.
[5804.59s -> 5805.55s]  Is it time to have a fight?
[5807.74s -> 5808.54s]  I got to fix my chat.
[5808.54s -> 5809.42s]  Hold on a second.
[5809.42s -> 5809.90s]  It's like...
[5809.90s -> 5810.62s]  It's all fucked up.
[5810.62s -> 5811.66s]  I can't see what anybody's saying.
[5812.88s -> 5814.32s]  Even in the other window.
[5814.32s -> 5816.86s]  Hold on.
[5816.86s -> 5817.66s]  Okay.
[5817.66s -> 5820.54s]  Yeah, you guys are like...
[5821.98s -> 5827.12s]  I'm full two or three minutes behind me.
[5827.12s -> 5827.44s]  All right.
[5827.44s -> 5833.71s]  How do I just make it so the scroll doesn't happen?
[5833.71s -> 5835.55s]  I can't, like, lock this.
[5835.55s -> 5839.72s]  Is there a way to remove the ability to scroll on,
[5839.72s -> 5841.00s]  like, chat window in Twitch?
[5841.00s -> 5843.80s]  Because it doesn't matter what I do.
[5843.80s -> 5845.00s]  I have to go get, like, uh...
[5845.00s -> 5848.91s]  I have to go get, like, my iPad or something.
[5848.91s -> 5849.63s]  Don't tell him.
[5849.63s -> 5850.75s]  No, tell me!
[5850.75s -> 5852.68s]  Remove the mouse wheel?
[5852.68s -> 5853.82s]  I don't think anything...
[5853.82s -> 5854.78s]  Can I lock it?
[5854.78s -> 5858.97s]  Make it so the program takes exclusive rights to the cursor.
[5858.97s -> 5862.49s]  I don't even know how the fuck to even do that.
[5862.49s -> 5864.28s]  I'll just deal with it.
[5864.28s -> 5866.60s]  I'll just deal with it.
[5866.60s -> 5872.33s]  I'm just gonna have to do this, like, every, like, few minutes.
[5872.33s -> 5875.32s]  Here we go.
[5875.32s -> 5875.88s]  Okay.
[5875.88s -> 5878.27s]  Full screen the game?
[5878.27s -> 5879.31s]  The game is full screen.
[5879.31s -> 5879.63s]  There...
[5879.63s -> 5880.51s]  I mean, there is no...
[5880.51s -> 5883.07s]  This game is, like, 12, 15 years old.
[5883.07s -> 5885.28s]  All right, here we go.
[5885.28s -> 5885.76s]  Let's fight.
[5885.76s -> 5886.64s]  Ready.
[5886.64s -> 5887.93s]  Go fight.
[5887.93s -> 5889.82s]  Go attack, go kill.
[5889.82s -> 5904.99s]  Where are they?
[5904.99s -> 5906.73s]  Why don't you guys go the long way?
[5907.37s -> 5915.68s]  Jerma, can you explain how you got this game to work?
[5915.68s -> 5916.72s]  Do you have the discs?
[5916.72s -> 5917.04s]  Yes.
[5918.35s -> 5921.55s]  Uh, so this game is currently running on the fan patch.
[5922.35s -> 5924.00s]  There is...
[5924.00s -> 5927.44s]  You have to get patch 1.1 and 1.2,
[5928.00s -> 5931.36s]  and then you have to get the 1.3 fan patch,
[5932.00s -> 5933.36s]  which fixes everything in the game.
[5934.08s -> 5939.05s]  Wait, actually, you know what?
[5939.05s -> 5939.53s]  Can I just...
[5941.00s -> 5941.72s]  Should I just attack?
[5948.19s -> 5948.51s]  Get it!
[5955.15s -> 5956.59s]  Just spy cap this fucking thing.
[5956.59s -> 5957.39s]  Who cares?
[5957.39s -> 5958.35s]  They're not even coming back.
[5958.35s -> 5959.31s]  They're not even paying attention.
[5966.46s -> 5967.26s]  They're too busy.
[5967.26s -> 5969.82s]  They're too busy fighting on the two-fort bridge
[5969.82s -> 5972.06s]  to realize I've taken the briefcase three times already.
[5974.32s -> 5974.72s]  We win.
[5975.44s -> 5976.64s]  Wait, they're not coming over here, are they?
[5982.12s -> 5982.76s]  No, I'm gonna get it.
[5989.53s -> 5990.17s]  This is gonna be it.
[5990.17s -> 5990.57s]  I got it.
[5990.57s -> 5993.12s]  I'm gonna own it.
[5993.12s -> 5995.12s]  And then there's only one more town to take.
[5995.12s -> 5996.16s]  Where's the creature?
[5996.16s -> 6001.69s]  I'm gonna eat that villager.
[6004.04s -> 6005.32s]  Why are you doing it so menacingly?
[6005.32s -> 6005.56s]  All right.
[6005.56s -> 6006.04s]  No, no, don't.
[6006.04s -> 6006.60s]  Don't.
[6006.60s -> 6006.84s]  Just...
[6008.01s -> 6008.97s]  No, no, no, no.
[6008.97s -> 6009.37s]  Do not...
[6014.62s -> 6014.94s]  It's...
[6014.94s -> 6015.34s]  You know what?
[6015.34s -> 6017.66s]  It's probably more efficient for him to eat villages
[6017.66s -> 6019.58s]  than to eat like 5,000 grain.
[6020.38s -> 6022.28s]  I'm gonna be honest.
[6023.00s -> 6026.40s]  Is it okay to destroy those trees?
[6028.03s -> 6030.59s]  I'm going to turn that tree into wood chippings.
[6030.59s -> 6030.99s]  All right, good.
[6030.99s -> 6032.43s]  We can take out some of his rage.
[6033.31s -> 6040.41s]  Take out some of your frustrations.
[6040.41s -> 6041.29s]  Like, do it.
[6044.20s -> 6044.52s]  Yeah!
[6046.65s -> 6047.21s]  You need this.
[6049.28s -> 6050.64s]  I'm going to play with that villager.
[6050.64s -> 6051.04s]  Good.
[6051.04s -> 6051.44s]  Okay.
[6051.44s -> 6052.00s]  Have fun.
[6052.00s -> 6052.40s]  We're actually...
[6052.40s -> 6053.28s]  We're gonna get it.
[6053.28s -> 6055.12s]  I can't believe I just took this village without anything.
[6056.00s -> 6064.78s]  No!
[6064.78s -> 6065.34s]  I can't.
[6065.34s -> 6067.42s]  Ugh, it's fucking scroll wheel bullshit.
[6070.73s -> 6072.17s]  I'm actually gonna have to get my iPad.
[6073.34s -> 6074.62s]  Like, I can't believe I got the village.
[6084.28s -> 6085.56s]  It's iPad time.
[6086.78s -> 6087.42s]  Punish him?
[6087.42s -> 6087.98s]  Oh, wait, wait.
[6087.98s -> 6088.30s]  We got...
[6088.30s -> 6088.62s]  Hold on.
[6090.30s -> 6092.22s]  Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[6092.22s -> 6093.50s]  We have your land.
[6093.50s -> 6094.54s]  Now what the fuck are you gonna do?
[6095.18s -> 6100.68s]  We're getting attacked, boys.
[6100.68s -> 6100.84s]  Where?
[6100.84s -> 6101.64s]  Kill them and drill them.
[6101.64s -> 6101.96s]  Oh, fuck.
[6101.96s -> 6102.60s]  Whoa, my God, dude.
[6108.52s -> 6108.84s]  Uh-oh.
[6110.91s -> 6111.55s]  Are we winning?
[6112.11s -> 6113.48s]  We're not winning this fight.
[6113.48s -> 6114.36s]  We're not winning the fight.
[6114.36s -> 6115.72s]  I just got fucking collapsed on...
[6117.18s -> 6118.22s]  Oh, my God.
[6118.22s -> 6119.74s]  They're here with their whole entire force.
[6119.74s -> 6122.81s]  Uh...
[6122.81s -> 6123.37s]  Murius!
[6124.01s -> 6124.88s]  Murius!
[6130.54s -> 6132.38s]  Stop playing with trees.
[6132.38s -> 6133.74s]  I need you over here for a little bit.
[6137.74s -> 6138.78s]  I'm out of breath.
[6138.78s -> 6140.70s]  Stop running with a tree in your hand.
[6142.62s -> 6143.58s]  What are you doing?
[6144.62s -> 6147.47s]  I'm gonna gather from the field.
[6149.23s -> 6150.03s]  Good job.
[6152.36s -> 6152.68s]  Okay.
[6153.56s -> 6154.36s]  Excellent work.
[6154.36s -> 6155.24s]  I need you over here.
[6155.96s -> 6156.92s]  It's time for you to start.
[6156.92s -> 6157.32s]  You have to...
[6157.32s -> 6158.20s]  It's time for you to have fun.
[6159.00s -> 6159.72s]  I need you over here.
[6160.44s -> 6164.43s]  I need you over here.
[6164.43s -> 6165.31s]  Over here, over here, over here.
[6176.00s -> 6177.60s]  You're being a bad parent.
[6177.60s -> 6179.52s]  Look, I'm just trying to defend the world here.
[6180.48s -> 6184.46s]  Coming.
[6184.46s -> 6184.78s]  See?
[6184.78s -> 6185.90s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[6185.90s -> 6187.42s]  Show them your fucking anger.
[6188.22s -> 6189.42s]  Show them your might.
[6190.14s -> 6200.19s]  Tell them they can't be in here.
[6201.08s -> 6201.72s]  You know what to do.
[6202.81s -> 6203.21s]  Eat them.
[6204.49s -> 6205.53s]  Leash to the army.
[6210.97s -> 6213.21s]  I'm going to stomp all over the platoon.
[6213.21s -> 6213.45s]  Good.
[6214.33s -> 6215.16s]  Do it.
[6217.87s -> 6218.59s]  Unleash it.
[6219.31s -> 6222.35s]  Is it faster than you?
[6222.35s -> 6222.59s]  Hold on.
[6222.59s -> 6223.95s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6223.95s -> 6224.19s]  All right.
[6224.19s -> 6224.59s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[6224.59s -> 6224.91s]  Get him.
[6228.38s -> 6228.78s]  Get him.
[6231.31s -> 6232.43s]  There you go, Murius.
[6234.35s -> 6235.55s]  Unleash your anger.
[6238.54s -> 6239.66s]  I'm out of breath.
[6239.66s -> 6240.38s]  It's all right.
[6240.38s -> 6241.34s]  Just kick another one.
[6241.34s -> 6241.74s]  Eat one.
[6242.54s -> 6243.74s]  They have no match.
[6244.46s -> 6245.96s]  Start eating people.
[6247.18s -> 6247.58s]  Eat them.
[6251.87s -> 6252.51s]  There we go.
[6256.97s -> 6257.53s]  Good job.
[6257.53s -> 6257.93s]  Come on.
[6259.23s -> 6260.11s]  I'm starving.
[6260.11s -> 6263.07s]  You'll have plenty of food in about five seconds, Murius.
[6263.07s -> 6264.35s]  Good fucking thunderclap.
[6265.15s -> 6265.71s]  There it is.
[6266.75s -> 6267.07s]  Yes.
[6268.03s -> 6275.12s]  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.
[6277.10s -> 6278.38s]  Murius, I love you.
[6279.10s -> 6280.70s]  You've done such a great job.
[6280.70s -> 6281.58s]  Unbelievable work.
[6282.97s -> 6284.01s]  Unbelievable.
[6285.61s -> 6286.17s]  Nice work.
[6286.17s -> 6286.97s]  Do you see that rage?
[6288.32s -> 6288.64s]  Okay.
[6290.38s -> 6316.44s]  Now literally eat as many of these people as you want.
[6316.44s -> 6318.20s]  He only eats live meat.
[6334.73s -> 6336.01s]  You're very good.
[6336.01s -> 6338.33s]  I'll munch on their villagers all the time.
[6338.33s -> 6341.95s]  They taste so strange.
[6341.95s -> 6343.23s]  He's going to get a dig.
[6343.23s -> 6344.51s]  Look what he did.
[6344.51s -> 6345.63s]  I'm so happy with him.
[6349.53s -> 6351.29s]  Taste for human flesh.
[6357.88s -> 6358.20s]  All right.
[6358.20s -> 6359.64s]  Time for you to go to bed.
[6359.64s -> 6360.04s]  You know what?
[6360.04s -> 6361.32s]  We wiped out their whole village.
[6361.32s -> 6361.80s]  Good job.
[6362.36s -> 6365.52s]  I actually need a...
[6365.52s -> 6366.16s]  What do we need here?
[6367.55s -> 6368.03s]  Inspect.
[6370.19s -> 6370.75s]  You can actually go...
[6370.75s -> 6371.87s]  You can go to bed.
[6371.87s -> 6372.35s]  You need to rest.
[6375.64s -> 6376.84s]  What do you think about that, Murius?
[6380.11s -> 6382.19s]  We need that storehouse built quicker.
[6382.19s -> 6385.95s]  I'm going to build the storehouse way more effective than he was in the last game.
[6387.92s -> 6389.84s]  He's just aiming to please.
[6389.84s -> 6391.20s]  He wants to please so much.
[6393.12s -> 6393.92s]  That's not the store...
[6393.92s -> 6394.56s]  Oh, it is.
[6397.58s -> 6398.22s]  So useful.
[6400.49s -> 6402.73s]  You deserve a week's rest after this.
[6404.75s -> 6405.47s]  Excellent job.
[6407.16s -> 6407.96s]  No, I didn't want to...
[6408.60s -> 6409.40s]  Very, very good.
[6410.83s -> 6411.87s]  You are so...
[6411.87s -> 6413.23s]  What a good cow.
[6414.59s -> 6415.15s]  Link?
[6415.15s -> 6415.87s]  Yeah.
[6415.87s -> 6422.96s]  In fact, I probably should bring him back to sleep.
[6422.96s -> 6423.28s]  Okay.
[6423.28s -> 6423.52s]  We need...
[6424.91s -> 6426.11s]  I have one more town to take over.
[6426.11s -> 6427.07s]  There's a scroll over here though.
[6432.36s -> 6434.60s]  What a beautiful sunset.
[6434.60s -> 6435.08s]  Yeah.
[6435.08s -> 6437.64s]  You gotta love a big ball of fire.
[6441.07s -> 6442.51s]  Let's see it again.
[6442.51s -> 6448.59s]  By clicking the action button on the sky, the hand will change to sundial mode.
[6448.59s -> 6452.59s]  When the action button is released, the sun will move in the heavens.
[6452.59s -> 6454.03s]  I can change the day-night cycle?
[6454.03s -> 6455.95s]  The power of the sun.
[6455.95s -> 6459.79s]  But with great power comes great responsibility.
[6459.79s -> 6461.79s]  Force, show us how it's done.
[6463.28s -> 6464.16s]  Change time to day.
[6477.84s -> 6480.32s]  But all light needs a shadow.
[6480.32s -> 6482.40s]  Change the time to night.
[6482.40s -> 6485.98s]  I feel like this is fucking with everybody's head.
[6487.50s -> 6489.42s]  Imagine you were outside when this happened.
[6489.42s -> 6489.98s]  Well done.
[6490.54s -> 6492.24s]  All right.
[6492.24s -> 6492.96s]  So you can chat in now.
[6492.96s -> 6493.68s]  That's cool.
[6493.68s -> 6514.04s]  Oh, rooster.
[6515.13s -> 6517.45s]  No, I need help.
[6517.45s -> 6520.73s]  This rooster wakes me up every single day.
[6520.73s -> 6522.81s]  I can't get enough sleep.
[6522.81s -> 6525.37s]  Please help me to silence it.
[6525.37s -> 6528.01s]  Maybe we can help him, leader.
[6528.01s -> 6528.97s]  Such tasks...
[6528.97s -> 6529.53s]  I don't understand.
[6529.53s -> 6531.37s]  ...really rewards, you know.
[6531.37s -> 6534.81s]  Roosters always crow when the sun comes up.
[6534.81s -> 6538.57s]  Perhaps if the sun came up a few times in a row,
[6538.57s -> 6541.45s]  the rooster would keep crowing until it gets hoarse.
[6546.73s -> 6549.45s]  But that's going to fuck up every country on earth.
[6553.69s -> 6556.65s]  Silence this rooster by making three days happen instantly.
[6556.65s -> 6557.37s]  And fuck up.
[6557.37s -> 6561.29s]  All of Wall Street will close and the Dow will drop 25 million points.
[6562.17s -> 6563.05s]  Is this smart?
[6590.04s -> 6590.76s]  He's still going.
[6595.61s -> 6596.89s]  You're rapidly moving the earth.
[6596.89s -> 6597.93s]  Everyone will just fly off.
[6599.90s -> 6600.94s]  We'd all be like, no!
[6601.18s -> 6602.30s]  Everyone would fly into space.
[6604.70s -> 6607.72s]  The rotating rooster has lost its voice.
[6610.75s -> 6611.31s]  10,000?
[6615.50s -> 6616.38s]  We'd be crushed?
[6616.94s -> 6618.86s]  Would we get crushed?
[6619.50s -> 6621.44s]  I'm thinking of crushed.
[6621.44s -> 6623.12s]  No, that's not right.
[6624.32s -> 6624.64s]  Come on.
[6624.64s -> 6627.36s]  I'm trying to satisfy the bloodlust of the people in chat.
[6630.38s -> 6630.62s]  All right.
[6630.62s -> 6635.42s]  So, Marius, what are you up to?
[6636.06s -> 6636.54s]  Hanging out?
[6637.26s -> 6638.70s]  In fact, come back and go to sleep.
[6638.70s -> 6639.34s]  I want you to grow.
[6640.14s -> 6643.85s]  I want you to go to sleep.
[6643.85s -> 6644.89s]  You've learned quite a lot.
[6645.61s -> 6646.73s]  I want you to stay in the pen.
[6647.69s -> 6649.45s]  And I want you to get some sleep.
[6649.45s -> 6652.52s]  How's everybody doing in this town?
[6652.52s -> 6656.60s]  We've got more homes.
[6656.60s -> 6656.92s]  Okay.
[6657.48s -> 6660.67s]  Let's get some new houses.
[6660.67s -> 6672.27s]  Population is booming in this town.
[6672.99s -> 6677.02s]  That'll be all right for now.
[6677.02s -> 6677.26s]  Yep.
[6677.26s -> 6678.30s]  I know I fucked it up.
[6678.30s -> 6679.10s]  It's okay, dude.
[6679.10s -> 6679.58s]  Don't worry.
[6680.38s -> 6683.80s]  Another wink?
[6683.80s -> 6684.52s]  What do you mean a wink?
[6690.44s -> 6691.24s]  That channel.
[6691.24s -> 6695.24s]  You guys are going to wake up at some point in the next four days.
[6695.24s -> 6698.44s]  And it's going to be like, oh, it's a popsicle stick joke now.
[6698.52s -> 6707.37s]  I'm going to tell you what it is.
[6707.37s -> 6712.33s]  All right.
[6712.33s -> 6713.05s]  How are we doing?
[6713.05s -> 6713.61s]  Is this good?
[6714.17s -> 6714.89s]  This has been built.
[6714.89s -> 6715.85s]  You have a storeroom now.
[6715.85s -> 6716.09s]  Good.
[6718.60s -> 6719.96s]  Is there any ore over here?
[6719.96s -> 6720.36s]  There is.
[6720.36s -> 6721.08s]  It's mine right here.
[6722.64s -> 6723.20s]  Armory?
[6724.08s -> 6724.40s]  Yeah.
[6724.40s -> 6724.64s]  Okay.
[6724.64s -> 6726.64s]  You guys can be like, we'll have another military here.
[6727.68s -> 6728.48s]  Get some roads.
[6731.34s -> 6733.10s]  I mean, how did you guys not even have any roads?
[6735.96s -> 6737.08s]  How did you not have roads?
[6754.01s -> 6754.57s]  That's fine.
[6754.57s -> 6755.13s]  Okay.
[6755.13s -> 6756.86s]  A little bit more.
[6756.86s -> 6759.50s]  I got to pee.
[6759.50s -> 6759.74s]  Fuck.
[6759.74s -> 6760.70s]  I got to pee.
[6760.70s -> 6760.94s]  All right.
[6760.94s -> 6761.42s]  I got to pee.
[6761.42s -> 6761.82s]  I got to pee.
[6761.82s -> 6764.22s]  And I'm going to figure out how to fix this chat scrolling.
[6764.62s -> 6765.02s]  I got to pee.
[6765.02s -> 6766.06s]  I'm going to pee my pants up your back.
[6766.62s -> 6767.68s]  Pause the game.
[6767.68s -> 6979.98s]  What's happening?
[6979.98s -> 6981.02s]  What is happening?
[6981.02s -> 6981.74s]  We're back.
[6981.74s -> 6981.98s]  All right.
[6981.98s -> 6985.74s]  Let's see if this worked.
[6985.74s -> 6985.98s]  Yeah.
[6985.98s -> 6988.54s]  I just did the fix you were talking about, Cad.
[6988.54s -> 6989.10s]  Thank you, Cad.
[6989.10s -> 6991.10s]  Let's see if this works.
[6991.10s -> 6992.94s]  And it might.
[6992.94s -> 6994.30s]  It may have fixed it.
[6994.30s -> 6995.42s]  It may have fixed it.
[7000.01s -> 7000.33s]  Okay.
[7000.89s -> 7002.33s]  All right.
[7002.33s -> 7004.65s]  Looks good.
[7004.65s -> 7010.19s]  All right.
[7010.19s -> 7011.23s]  Here we go.
[7011.23s -> 7011.79s]  We need to take off.
[7011.79s -> 7012.51s]  What's this?
[7012.51s -> 7017.45s]  Should I make something new?
[7017.45s -> 7021.60s]  What's this thing?
[7021.60s -> 7022.80s]  Ranged armory?
[7028.40s -> 7028.64s]  All right.
[7028.64s -> 7029.20s]  I can wait.
[7029.20s -> 7031.52s]  I can recruit ranks of archers.
[7032.35s -> 7033.07s]  Yeah.
[7033.07s -> 7035.48s]  Let's get it.
[7035.48s -> 7036.60s]  Lumber mill.
[7036.60s -> 7037.00s]  Yeah.
[7037.00s -> 7037.80s]  Let's get it.
[7037.80s -> 7039.15s]  I don't know.
[7039.15s -> 7039.31s]  Wait.
[7039.31s -> 7039.55s]  Hold on.
[7039.55s -> 7044.17s]  I need to close this.
[7044.17s -> 7044.97s]  This is done, right?
[7046.67s -> 7048.03s]  Ranged archery.
[7049.39s -> 7053.21s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[7053.21s -> 7053.93s]  Is this?
[7053.93s -> 7054.57s]  I'm confused.
[7055.13s -> 7058.59s]  Do I have to build a separate building for ranged?
[7059.31s -> 7064.64s]  I do.
[7064.64s -> 7065.28s]  Oh, shit.
[7065.28s -> 7065.52s]  Okay.
[7066.56s -> 7068.83s]  I need what?
[7068.83s -> 7068.99s]  All right.
[7068.99s -> 7069.87s]  We got some of you guys.
[7069.87s -> 7070.27s]  Let's go.
[7070.27s -> 7071.15s]  We need some breeders.
[7073.95s -> 7075.07s]  Is there any men?
[7080.76s -> 7082.14s]  All right.
[7082.14s -> 7082.54s]  Let's go.
[7083.66s -> 7084.22s]  Forester.
[7085.63s -> 7087.23s]  Disciple forester.
[7087.23s -> 7087.79s]  Forester.
[7089.07s -> 7089.55s]  Forester.
[7089.55s -> 7090.75s]  Disciple forester.
[7090.75s -> 7091.23s]  Forester.
[7091.95s -> 7092.67s]  More.
[7092.67s -> 7093.39s]  We need more wood.
[7093.39s -> 7095.07s]  Disciple forester.
[7095.07s -> 7095.39s]  Wood.
[7096.96s -> 7098.64s]  Disciple forester.
[7098.64s -> 7099.76s]  And we need miners too.
[7103.13s -> 7104.73s]  Subaru forester.
[7104.73s -> 7106.17s]  Disciple forester.
[7107.69s -> 7110.86s]  This is going to be the base of operations for military.
[7111.50s -> 7113.23s]  Can I put you here?
[7113.79s -> 7115.71s]  Disciple mine worker.
[7122.09s -> 7124.09s]  Disciple mine worker.
[7124.73s -> 7127.28s]  Disciple mine worker.
[7127.28s -> 7127.60s]  All right.
[7129.02s -> 7130.14s]  That sets that.
[7130.78s -> 7134.14s]  Now we have to deal with this one town here.
[7134.78s -> 7136.56s]  Where's Murius?
[7137.12s -> 7142.44s]  I think something's very funny.
[7144.40s -> 7145.20s]  What was so funny?
[7146.20s -> 7148.12s]  What are you laughing so hard at?
[7148.12s -> 7150.20s]  You like laughing at an old man?
[7151.16s -> 7154.62s]  I don't understand.
[7159.48s -> 7159.72s]  Why?
[7161.84s -> 7162.56s]  What a dick.
[7166.35s -> 7167.39s]  Haha, boomer.
[7168.11s -> 7172.11s]  I'm going to snack on that grain.
[7172.11s -> 7173.23s]  No, don't eat the grain.
[7173.23s -> 7174.35s]  You're supposed to eat people.
[7174.91s -> 7177.52s]  That's all right.
[7177.52s -> 7179.66s]  All right.
[7179.66s -> 7181.90s]  I want an army and we're going to take over the last village.
[7182.46s -> 7185.93s]  He's either going back to laugh at the fucking old guy again.
[7190.83s -> 7191.07s]  No.
[7191.63s -> 7205.24s]  Okay.
[7205.24s -> 7208.56s]  I don't know what his plan is, but you're rested.
[7208.56s -> 7209.20s]  I need you down here.
[7209.76s -> 7215.85s]  Come all the way over here because we're going to take over the next town with Murius.
[7216.57s -> 7219.08s]  And we're going to have some military here.
[7219.08s -> 7219.96s]  So come over here.
[7220.84s -> 7221.40s]  Go for it.
[7222.44s -> 7222.68s]  Let's...
[7223.96s -> 7224.62s]  Is this done?
[7225.34s -> 7226.46s]  Not built yet?
[7226.46s -> 7227.34s]  I want to build this.
[7227.34s -> 7228.46s]  We're doing a whole military.
[7229.10s -> 7233.66s]  Once we have enough wood.
[7233.66s -> 7234.78s]  How much wood do I need?
[7235.93s -> 7236.33s]  A lot.
[7237.58s -> 7238.54s]  I'm going to start helping out here.
[7239.92s -> 7241.28s]  That's not right.
[7241.28s -> 7245.36s]  The green ring you see is the extent of your influence.
[7245.36s -> 7246.00s]  I need ore.
[7246.72s -> 7247.04s]  All right.
[7247.04s -> 7249.88s]  Let's get a fucking army.
[7249.88s -> 7257.80s]  More ore.
[7257.80s -> 7264.44s]  Come on.
[7264.44s -> 7269.36s]  Come on.
[7269.36s -> 7275.10s]  Really?
[7275.10s -> 7275.58s]  Come on.
[7276.78s -> 7277.34s]  Ah, okay.
[7277.34s -> 7277.66s]  I got it.
[7278.30s -> 7285.05s]  Can I just break it?
[7285.05s -> 7285.45s]  What?
[7285.45s -> 7287.13s]  I thought I had to need more ore to build it.
[7287.93s -> 7290.57s]  All right, guys.
[7290.57s -> 7292.09s]  It's time to fucking end mission one.
[7301.55s -> 7302.27s]  I'm not picking the flag.
[7302.83s -> 7311.64s]  Is there...
[7311.64s -> 7312.60s]  Not enough men.
[7312.60s -> 7313.32s]  Oh, okay.
[7314.04s -> 7314.84s]  That's all right.
[7315.64s -> 7316.60s]  We only needed a few.
[7320.14s -> 7322.68s]  Look at that.
[7322.68s -> 7325.40s]  I can't click the link because I have to alt-tab the game.
[7325.40s -> 7326.28s]  And it might break.
[7327.08s -> 7337.56s]  And I'm scared to break the game unless I hit the pot.
[7337.56s -> 7337.80s]  Okay.
[7337.80s -> 7338.52s]  What the fuck was that?
[7339.16s -> 7339.32s]  All right.
[7339.32s -> 7339.72s]  You ready?
[7340.52s -> 7341.71s]  Let's go.
[7343.66s -> 7344.38s]  The last town.
[7344.38s -> 7345.10s]  Does it have military?
[7345.10s -> 7346.54s]  I think I already killed all the military.
[7347.71s -> 7348.51s]  I did.
[7348.51s -> 7349.39s]  Take it over.
[7349.39s -> 7349.87s]  Murius.
[7350.51s -> 7353.90s]  Get over there.
[7353.90s -> 7367.90s]  Just buy another computer.
[7368.62s -> 7373.72s]  You know, you mean like buy like an old...
[7373.72s -> 7376.04s]  You want me to capture a computer through a capture card?
[7377.08s -> 7381.85s]  Have an old computer and capture another with my other computer?
[7382.73s -> 7384.94s]  I mean, this game runs fine.
[7385.66s -> 7389.93s]  All right.
[7389.93s -> 7390.89s]  Murius, inspect it.
[7391.45s -> 7392.33s]  Just be a presence.
[7392.97s -> 7395.53s]  I'm gonna play with that building.
[7395.53s -> 7395.77s]  Yes.
[7396.73s -> 7397.29s]  Go for it.
[7398.73s -> 7399.29s]  Learn.
[7399.29s -> 7399.85s]  Think.
[7399.85s -> 7400.41s]  Touch.
[7400.41s -> 7400.97s]  Inspect.
[7403.47s -> 7404.43s]  Oh, you could eat somebody.
[7404.43s -> 7404.99s]  That works too.
[7405.63s -> 7423.08s]  Oh, screaming.
[7423.96s -> 7439.10s]  Did he step in it?
[7439.18s -> 7441.31s]  Oh, no.
[7441.31s -> 7442.19s]  Six flags.
[7446.60s -> 7448.44s]  He just shit in their food.
[7450.94s -> 7452.83s]  You did it.
[7452.83s -> 7454.51s]  No, don't pick up a person.
[7454.51s -> 7455.63s]  What are you doing?
[7455.63s -> 7456.51s]  They're capturing.
[7457.96s -> 7458.76s]  Put him down.
[7458.76s -> 7459.32s]  Put him down.
[7460.04s -> 7460.52s]  Put him down.
[7460.52s -> 7463.24s]  Wait, are you putting him into the...
[7463.24s -> 7463.80s]  What are you doing?
[7464.36s -> 7468.44s]  You're telling him to work in the field?
[7472.49s -> 7473.93s]  Sleep next to the building?
[7473.93s -> 7474.41s]  No, no, no.
[7475.05s -> 7479.93s]  We almost got it.
[7479.93s -> 7482.70s]  He's just a baby.
[7482.70s -> 7483.82s]  He doesn't really know what he's doing.
[7492.68s -> 7492.92s]  All right.
[7492.92s -> 7494.36s]  That was such a toddler run.
[7495.08s -> 7496.41s]  If I've ever seen one.
[7517.72s -> 7519.80s]  It's time for Murius to get a skill tree.
[7539.21s -> 7540.67s]  Oh, okay.
[7542.04s -> 7545.64s]  If you want to leave this land, click on the gold scroll.
[7548.48s -> 7548.88s]  Let's go.
[7551.02s -> 7555.74s]  Are you sure you wish to leave the land again to confirm?
[7555.74s -> 7556.38s]  Yeah, let's go.
[7557.26s -> 7562.88s]  I'm ready to rock and roll.
[7562.88s -> 7569.76s]  Don't be evil.
[7569.76s -> 7575.13s]  I thought that was a pop-up window talking about the game crashed.
[7575.13s -> 7577.05s]  And it was, do you want to force quit?
[7577.05s -> 7578.70s]  I thought that's what this was.
[7578.70s -> 7580.78s]  Look, I'm only 1% evil, guys.
[7582.72s -> 7584.32s]  Number of towns taken by force, three.
[7585.04s -> 7585.84s]  One for...
[7585.84s -> 7586.48s]  Okay.
[7586.48s -> 7586.88s]  Creature.
[7587.44s -> 7589.61s]  Creature is only 5% evil.
[7590.92s -> 7591.48s]  Fatness.
[7592.59s -> 7593.79s]  Fatness, fatness.
[7597.52s -> 7599.95s]  What does that even mean?
[7599.95s -> 7600.35s]  Fitness.
[7604.35s -> 7605.88s]  Height, four.
[7605.88s -> 7607.39s]  Final.
[7607.39s -> 7608.91s]  Hit points, 100.
[7608.91s -> 7610.83s]  Number of bowel movements, 11.
[7610.83s -> 7612.43s]  Killed 34 people.
[7612.43s -> 7615.53s]  It's eight, six villagers, okay.
[7620.72s -> 7621.28s]  World.
[7621.28s -> 7621.76s]  Happiness.
[7623.48s -> 7623.88s]  Vital.
[7623.88s -> 7624.28s]  Yeah, all right.
[7624.28s -> 7625.00s]  We're good.
[7625.00s -> 7625.80s]  Let's go.
[7625.80s -> 7630.70s]  34 people killed, only 4% evil.
[7630.70s -> 7632.46s]  Well, those were attacking people.
[7632.46s -> 7633.90s]  That was an attacking group.
[7634.54s -> 7640.04s]  Horse land.
[7640.04s -> 7643.61s]  I'm certain they'll join us against the Aztec hordes.
[7644.25s -> 7646.41s]  And they have a creature, too.
[7646.41s -> 7648.81s]  We need to build a town here, though.
[7648.81s -> 7650.65s]  We need to try to grow.
[7651.77s -> 7654.25s]  First, let's look at the Norse.
[7654.25s -> 7657.13s]  They seems they have a weak concentrate.
[7657.13s -> 7661.21s]  And your godly powers will often let you hear his thoughts.
[7661.21s -> 7662.25s]  I was the aggressor?
[7662.25s -> 7663.93s]  Greeks on my homeland?
[7664.49s -> 7668.17s]  I saw them all die at the hands of the Aztecs!
[7669.37s -> 7670.01s]  Who's talking?
[7670.81s -> 7674.86s]  Do they have a devil and an angel?
[7674.86s -> 7677.66s]  If we build up an impressive enough town,
[7677.66s -> 7680.54s]  these Norse will flock to join us.
[7680.54s -> 7682.94s]  Or if we build a big army,
[7682.94s -> 7685.84s]  we can hunt them down with a sword.
[7689.36s -> 7690.08s]  Norse leader?
[7690.08s -> 7691.76s]  Yeah, but who is the Norse leader?
[7692.96s -> 7698.22s]  Fucking Odin?
[7698.94s -> 7701.42s]  All right, here we go.
[7702.60s -> 7703.32s]  Where's Murius?
[7703.64s -> 7704.36s]  Still growing.
[7706.89s -> 7707.53s]  All right, here we go.
[7707.53s -> 7712.17s]  We need to start building.
[7712.17s -> 7714.49s]  We should start making houses.
[7714.49s -> 7715.85s]  Wait, wait, no, block out the town.
[7715.85s -> 7716.33s]  Here we go.
[7716.33s -> 7716.65s]  Ready?
[7716.65s -> 7719.87s]  Let's get a group this like out here.
[7719.87s -> 7721.95s]  This is going to be out to here.
[7721.95s -> 7725.23s]  This is going to be houses over this way.
[7725.23s -> 7729.53s]  We're going to have our temples going to go around here.
[7730.33s -> 7734.91s]  Whatever, something like that.
[7734.91s -> 7736.59s]  And that looks all right for now.
[7737.23s -> 7737.87s]  What is this?
[7737.87s -> 7741.13s]  Ah, yes, walls.
[7741.37s -> 7742.57s]  Walls.
[7742.57s -> 7745.85s]  These are vital to the defense of your city.
[7745.85s -> 7747.53s]  We need to build this wall
[7747.53s -> 7750.17s]  to ensure the Norse can't invade.
[7750.17s -> 7752.97s]  Click the action button on the turret once.
[7752.97s -> 7754.97s]  Drag and then click to place it.
[7756.17s -> 7765.71s]  Okay, that was so bad.
[7765.71s -> 7768.35s]  I do enjoy the safe, warm feeling.
[7768.35s -> 7769.71s]  There's no wall here.
[7769.71s -> 7771.23s]  It's foundation.
[7772.19s -> 7774.08s]  It's an ugly ass wall.
[7775.80s -> 7776.60s]  Drag wall from...
[7776.60s -> 7777.48s]  Wait, didn't I just...
[7778.36s -> 7786.54s]  Did I do this right?
[7788.25s -> 7789.69s]  Needs like ore or something?
[7789.69s -> 7790.57s]  I feel like this is wrong.
[7791.37s -> 7796.08s]  All right, whatever.
[7796.08s -> 7798.00s]  Let's get the process going here.
[7798.80s -> 7802.41s]  So we need houses.
[7802.97s -> 7804.25s]  We need a storeroom, first of all.
[7804.25s -> 7805.85s]  Let's get that over here.
[7808.17s -> 7809.69s]  Right there in a good spot.
[7809.69s -> 7810.65s]  Wait, where's like the most...
[7811.29s -> 7812.25s]  No, I want this over here.
[7814.14s -> 7815.80s]  Definitely put this over here.
[7815.80s -> 7816.76s]  Near all this other shit.
[7817.40s -> 7820.75s]  Can I build it like right here?
[7822.03s -> 7822.43s]  I can't.
[7822.43s -> 7823.95s]  All right, right next to trees and shit.
[7823.95s -> 7826.99s]  Look, the people have remembered all about altars.
[7826.99s -> 7830.43s]  Altars are where you can focus your godly miracles.
[7830.91s -> 7832.83s]  Let's build one as soon as possible.
[7832.83s -> 7834.64s]  Oh, as soon as possible.
[7834.64s -> 7836.08s]  What do you mean, as soon as possible?
[7840.14s -> 7840.70s]  Are you helping?
[7841.34s -> 7844.12s]  He's on a tree in your room?
[7844.68s -> 7848.94s]  I don't know what his obsession is
[7848.94s -> 7850.38s]  with picking up trees and just putting them down.
[7851.26s -> 7852.40s]  All right, what is this for?
[7852.96s -> 7854.73s]  I'm going to put this up here.
[7855.68s -> 7856.24s]  Out of the way.
[7856.88s -> 7858.56s]  Like over here or something?
[7859.12s -> 7859.92s]  I'm going to put this over here.
[7861.34s -> 7863.90s]  Such power can be wielded with an altar.
[7864.97s -> 7865.77s]  Oh, it's an altar.
[7866.65s -> 7871.44s]  All right, what about a mine?
[7871.44s -> 7872.56s]  Are there any mines over here?
[7874.43s -> 7875.79s]  This is not really a mine.
[7875.79s -> 7876.27s]  It's up here.
[7876.27s -> 7881.32s]  Okay, you're enabling him.
[7882.62s -> 7883.26s]  No, all right.
[7883.26s -> 7886.68s]  How about that was not?
[7886.68s -> 7887.80s]  All right, that was bad.
[7887.80s -> 7888.36s]  That was bad.
[7888.36s -> 7889.64s]  You just stepped on a village's head.
[7890.36s -> 7890.92s]  Don't do that.
[7891.64s -> 7895.55s]  All right, you just you literally just killed somebody for no reason,
[7895.55s -> 7898.24s]  but we don't waste shit around here.
[7898.88s -> 7903.12s]  Astonishing one.
[7903.12s -> 7906.97s]  We're protected against the Norse.
[7907.53s -> 7910.81s]  If you need a reminder of what your objectives are,
[7910.81s -> 7912.89s]  go to the objectives part of the menu.
[7912.89s -> 7913.53s]  What was I doing?
[7914.17s -> 7917.82s]  These crafty Greeks are building walls,
[7917.82s -> 7920.14s]  and so they should send a troop.
[7920.14s -> 7920.86s]  Did you just do it again?
[7921.90s -> 7923.10s]  Oh, well, that was a split.
[7926.89s -> 7928.09s]  That was really cool.
[7928.73s -> 7930.40s]  I'm going to play.
[7930.40s -> 7931.04s]  All right, clay.
[7931.04s -> 7931.84s]  Don't hurt anybody.
[7931.84s -> 7933.12s]  Don't stomp on people.
[7933.12s -> 7935.42s]  Okay, I need to build this.
[7935.42s -> 7937.90s]  Okay, we need to be foresters and builders.
[7942.70s -> 7943.90s]  Forrester, forrester.
[7944.78s -> 7946.30s]  For work, we need some breeders and houses.
[7947.82s -> 7949.42s]  All right, we're getting houses, houses, houses.
[7949.42s -> 7950.14s]  Let's go.
[7950.14s -> 7950.86s]  This is house.
[7955.58s -> 7956.54s]  You're not helping.
[7956.54s -> 7957.42s]  You're not doing anything.
[7966.24s -> 7966.96s]  Fucking idiot.
[7967.77s -> 7970.09s]  Like, you're actually being stupid now.
[7974.75s -> 7975.71s]  Get this out of the way.
[7983.34s -> 7984.06s]  He's trying.
[7985.02s -> 7985.90s]  He's not, oh, he's not.
[7985.90s -> 7987.26s]  He's just throwing stuff around.
[7992.60s -> 7996.62s]  He is still a baby.
[7996.62s -> 7997.42s]  Need a farm.
[7999.80s -> 8001.56s]  I need to poo fairly badly.
[8001.56s -> 8001.96s]  What do you mean?
[8001.96s -> 8003.48s]  What is fairly bad?
[8003.48s -> 8004.28s]  All right, wait, wait, wait.
[8004.28s -> 8004.84s]  I need fields.
[8006.25s -> 8008.57s]  Fields are going to go near the storeroom over here.
[8009.29s -> 8010.97s]  Because this is where all the forests are.
[8010.97s -> 8012.17s]  And then mine is right there too.
[8012.17s -> 8013.29s]  The fields are all going over here.
[8015.95s -> 8016.35s]  Right here.
[8017.47s -> 8018.43s]  I want another one.
[8019.15s -> 8026.67s]  I'm going to construct that building.
[8027.87s -> 8028.19s]  Good.
[8029.31s -> 8029.79s]  Please do.
[8036.09s -> 8037.61s]  Oh, you can make it bigger.
[8037.61s -> 8039.53s]  Oh, I wish I knew that.
[8039.53s -> 8042.08s]  Okay, nice job.
[8043.36s -> 8044.64s]  Should I gather rocks?
[8044.64s -> 8046.17s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[8051.00s -> 8051.96s]  Definitely, go get some rocks.
[8054.96s -> 8055.84s]  Very helpful.
[8055.84s -> 8062.96s]  Any more buildings?
[8063.68s -> 8064.64s]  What's the current need?
[8065.52s -> 8066.56s]  Ore, we need ore.
[8067.12s -> 8068.16s]  Let me get like another...
[8068.96s -> 8072.35s]  Put this over here.
[8075.71s -> 8078.32s]  I'm going to put one more of one for the influence.
[8079.60s -> 8081.10s]  All right, let's go, let's go.
[8081.98s -> 8082.62s]  How's this looking?
[8082.62s -> 8084.78s]  I need some more wood.
[8085.50s -> 8087.76s]  Give us a cow emote.
[8089.53s -> 8091.29s]  Actually, it wouldn't really be that bad, would it?
[8092.09s -> 8098.14s]  We're going to do a whole line of houses.
[8098.14s -> 8114.52s]  That house is a little ugly, but it's all right.
[8114.52s -> 8115.32s]  We need food too.
[8115.32s -> 8116.52s]  I know, I'm working on it.
[8116.52s -> 8117.08s]  I'm working on it.
[8121.61s -> 8124.41s]  All right, that's it, that's it.
[8124.41s -> 8125.37s]  That's it, that's it.
[8125.37s -> 8126.01s]  Enough houses.
[8126.57s -> 8129.20s]  Come over here, I'll help you build this.
[8131.12s -> 8137.60s]  I mean, he's not constructing the building.
[8137.60s -> 8139.20s]  He's just putting wood next to it.
[8140.16s -> 8146.59s]  Your village is starving.
[8148.49s -> 8150.49s]  Well, I have to get the necessities ready.
[8151.29s -> 8155.62s]  Most of them.
[8156.40s -> 8162.40s]  The whole town is a one road.
[8162.40s -> 8163.04s]  It's all right.
[8165.50s -> 8167.98s]  Okay, now we're going to...
[8168.94s -> 8169.98s]  I need farmers.
[8171.45s -> 8173.29s]  So some of you foresters come over here.
[8177.52s -> 8178.48s]  Let's get this shit rolling.
[8178.56s -> 8180.08s]  Can the Aztecs through?
[8180.08s -> 8182.40s]  This is Norse land.
[8182.40s -> 8184.32s]  No intruders must be allowed.
[8184.32s -> 8184.82s]  Eat this.
[8186.20s -> 8186.70s]  Eat this.
[8187.72s -> 8188.60s]  Stop shitting bull.
[8188.60s -> 8189.64s]  Like, is it fertilizer?
[8189.64s -> 8190.84s]  I mean, it could be.
[8191.88s -> 8194.16s]  I need breeders too.
[8196.08s -> 8196.72s]  I'm starving.
[8196.72s -> 8197.84s]  Eat. No, eat it.
[8198.96s -> 8199.46s]  Eat it.
[8200.08s -> 8201.58s]  You just had an opportunity to eat.
[8209.93s -> 8210.43s]  Breeders.
[8211.07s -> 8213.07s]  Disciple breeder.
[8213.07s -> 8214.61s]  I need a couple more breeders.
[8215.17s -> 8215.67s]  Good.
[8215.81s -> 8217.17s]  Disciple breeder.
[8217.17s -> 8218.37s]  What's my population look like?
[8219.17s -> 8220.45s]  Disciple breeder.
[8220.45s -> 8221.01s]  All right, good.
[8224.74s -> 8225.54s]  You actually did something.
[8225.54s -> 8226.34s]  Holy shit.
[8226.34s -> 8228.18s]  You have built an altar.
[8228.18s -> 8230.26s]  He actually did something.
[8230.26s -> 8231.70s]  He actually put it in the right spot too.
[8231.70s -> 8232.20s]  Nice work.
[8237.01s -> 8238.05s]  Sorry, you can have a snack.
[8238.61s -> 8244.14s]  Altars work on a power called man.
[8244.14s -> 8247.18s]  You can generate manna by creating worshipers.
[8247.18s -> 8248.94s]  Is he going to learn how to do the water spell again?
[8248.94s -> 8249.90s]  Create a worshiper.
[8249.90s -> 8250.86s]  Show us you can do it.
[8252.54s -> 8253.98s]  Okay, create a worshiper.
[8253.98s -> 8256.30s]  Create disciple worshiper to assist manna.
[8257.26s -> 8260.24s]  Nah, I gotta keep doing this.
[8260.24s -> 8261.20s]  You're not doing anything.
[8261.20s -> 8263.06s]  Come here.
[8263.06s -> 8263.62s]  Worship her.
[8267.07s -> 8268.59s]  Now I can start casting spells.
[8268.59s -> 8271.39s]  Of course, more worshipers mean more manna.
[8271.39s -> 8274.64s]  Of course, costs manna.
[8274.64s -> 8277.20s]  And you need worshipers to generate manna.
[8278.00s -> 8278.56s]  Simple.
[8278.56s -> 8279.92s]  And get this.
[8279.92s -> 8284.08s]  You can drop people straight into the altar to create manna too.
[8284.64s -> 8286.08s]  You won't ever see him again though.
[8286.08s -> 8287.28s]  I gotta harvest this shit myself.
[8287.28s -> 8287.84s]  Look at this.
[8287.84s -> 8292.96s]  I need more farmers.
[8292.96s -> 8293.44s]  Look at this shit.
[8293.44s -> 8294.24s]  It's not enough.
[8316.80s -> 8318.48s]  Still, give it a try, boss.
[8319.28s -> 8319.84s]  Miracle.
[8322.48s -> 8322.80s]  Okay.
[8323.60s -> 8324.80s]  I have a water miracle.
[8324.80s -> 8326.00s]  And drop it on the field.
[8326.80s -> 8329.28s]  Oh, fuck.
[8331.82s -> 8333.58s]  What field does he want me to drop it on?
[8334.46s -> 8336.53s]  Drop it on the field over there?
[8336.53s -> 8337.41s]  Like my field?
[8338.21s -> 8339.33s]  Does it matter?
[8347.04s -> 8349.04s]  I didn't know if there was one for the tutorial or something.
[8349.04s -> 8350.16s]  I had to do it in a specific place.
[8350.96s -> 8352.72s]  All right, lots of food.
[8353.36s -> 8355.34s]  There's also something new over here.
[8355.34s -> 8361.39s]  If you want your town to grow quickly, it'll need lots of food.
[8362.67s -> 8366.19s]  Our creature can help with this by gathering crops.
[8368.69s -> 8372.53s]  All you have to do is assign him the role of gatherer near a field.
[8373.66s -> 8377.58s]  To assign the creature a role, open the creature roles interface.
[8378.98s -> 8381.78s]  Select the green gatherer role button.
[8381.78s -> 8385.54s]  This changes the creature's role and puts the leash in your hand.
[8386.18s -> 8388.93s]  Okay, creature role.
[8389.49s -> 8389.97s]  Gatherer.
[8392.08s -> 8393.04s]  Excellent.
[8393.04s -> 8395.28s]  Now just double click the action button
[8395.28s -> 8397.44s]  where you want the creature to perform the role.
[8398.08s -> 8400.43s]  He's asleep.
[8401.07s -> 8402.59s]  I mean, over here.
[8402.59s -> 8404.51s]  That means the big one is probably the best one to do.
[8411.54s -> 8413.94s]  See the radius around the flag?
[8413.94s -> 8416.74s]  The creature will gather resources from within.
[8416.74s -> 8417.78s]  That's actually really cool.
[8417.78s -> 8420.58s]  Always carry out roles inside the radius.
[8420.58s -> 8421.38s]  Wake his ass up.
[8422.50s -> 8423.86s]  Hey, relax.
[8424.66s -> 8428.18s]  At the moment, your creature isn't a very good collector.
[8428.18s -> 8430.50s]  He's not gathering much grain each time.
[8431.86s -> 8435.62s]  This is because he's a level one gatherer.
[8435.62s -> 8439.46s]  You could improve his performance in roles by spending triple.
[8439.46s -> 8440.82s]  Free will.
[8440.82s -> 8442.34s]  Should we just give him free will?
[8442.34s -> 8443.06s]  Clever, hey?
[8444.26s -> 8445.94s]  Let's give him complete free will.
[8447.22s -> 8451.14s]  A builder or an entertainer to keep the people amused.
[8451.78s -> 8454.85s]  The creatures help with the construction.
[8454.93s -> 8456.69s]  Of anything in the town.
[8456.69s -> 8459.57s]  You're supposed to be gathering food.
[8459.57s -> 8461.73s]  We'll make him serve as an army.
[8461.73s -> 8463.33s]  He loves trees.
[8463.33s -> 8467.33s]  Our creature is still small and he's not a skilled warrior.
[8467.33s -> 8470.61s]  You can use tribute to upgrade his warrior role
[8470.61s -> 8472.77s]  and he'll get way more lethal.
[8474.53s -> 8479.65s]  Yes, or you can simply leave him in free will mode.
[8479.65s -> 8483.25s]  He'll do whatever he wants and whatever you've taught him.
[8483.25s -> 8484.53s]  He's a free spirit.
[8484.53s -> 8486.93s]  The last thing you need to know about roles
[8486.93s -> 8490.05s]  is that they affect your creature's free will.
[8490.05s -> 8493.33s]  Yes, the longer he remains in a role,
[8493.33s -> 8495.25s]  the less free will he'll have.
[8495.25s -> 8495.73s]  Oh, no.
[8496.77s -> 8499.01s]  Leave him in a role for too long.
[8499.01s -> 8501.84s]  Become more like a machine than a pet.
[8501.84s -> 8502.32s]  Oh, no.
[8502.32s -> 8504.80s]  Using him in roles for a while is fine.
[8505.76s -> 8507.04s]  I don't like that.
[8507.04s -> 8509.44s]  And you can see how much free will he has
[8509.44s -> 8512.56s]  by looking at this bar on the creature interface.
[8512.56s -> 8513.84s]  Okay, interesting.
[8514.64s -> 8517.04s]  To remove your creature from a role,
[8517.04s -> 8518.96s]  click on the free will button.
[8519.52s -> 8523.97s]  Now play around with roles and stuff, boss.
[8523.97s -> 8526.69s]  And see if you can get a bigger town out of it.
[8526.69s -> 8530.93s]  And remember, if you get attacked, make him a warrior.
[8530.93s -> 8532.53s]  We share the hatred.
[8532.53s -> 8535.73s]  Who do these creeps think they are?
[8535.73s -> 8537.65s]  All right, well, back to free will.
[8538.29s -> 8541.76s]  Free will.
[8545.04s -> 8545.76s]  You can do whatever you want.
[8545.76s -> 8546.72s]  You don't have to gather anymore.
[8546.72s -> 8547.20s]  Free will.
[8547.76s -> 8550.13s]  You are free.
[8550.13s -> 8552.37s]  I don't want you just gathering food all day.
[8553.33s -> 8555.87s]  All right, let me build.
[8555.87s -> 8559.63s]  I got to build a warrior's area.
[8562.27s -> 8567.81s]  We need a armory because, I mean, we have to have one.
[8567.81s -> 8568.53s]  Put it at the gate.
[8569.49s -> 8570.05s]  Right here.
[8571.63s -> 8574.35s]  I thought these Greeks were a peaceful race.
[8574.35s -> 8574.59s]  What?
[8574.59s -> 8575.39s]  You saw me build that.
[8575.39s -> 8576.35s]  I must watch closely.
[8578.11s -> 8578.67s]  Oh, shit.
[8580.03s -> 8581.60s]  Well, he's been, what?
[8581.60s -> 8583.36s]  He's been threatening me the whole fucking level.
[8584.16s -> 8585.44s]  Oh, these Greeks.
[8585.44s -> 8586.72s]  I thought they were destroyed.
[8586.72s -> 8588.80s]  And I'm going to kill them and destroy them.
[8588.80s -> 8590.24s]  I thought the Aztecs wiped them out.
[8590.24s -> 8591.76s]  Oh, I thought they were a peaceful people.
[8591.76s -> 8592.32s]  What the fuck?
[8592.88s -> 8596.18s]  How dare they encroach on my land?
[8596.74s -> 8601.55s]  Murius.
[8602.27s -> 8602.83s]  Might need you.
[8608.53s -> 8609.01s]  Murius.
[8611.54s -> 8612.42s]  No, don't eat this one.
[8613.06s -> 8613.70s]  Don't eat this one.
[8613.70s -> 8614.50s]  This one's important.
[8615.87s -> 8616.43s]  Put down.
[8617.87s -> 8618.11s]  Okay.
[8618.75s -> 8631.60s]  I'm not going to kill anybody yet.
[8631.60s -> 8632.00s]  Not yet.
[8632.88s -> 8637.78s]  Okay, let's see.
[8637.78s -> 8639.54s]  Let's water the mountain.
[8640.58s -> 8641.54s]  Here we go.
[8641.54s -> 8641.78s]  Ready?
[8641.78s -> 8642.74s]  Murius, take a look at this.
[8643.54s -> 8646.02s]  He's kicked a rock.
[8646.02s -> 8646.74s]  Come here, Murius.
[8646.74s -> 8647.54s]  Look.
[8647.54s -> 8648.10s]  Look what I have.
[8652.18s -> 8652.98s]  Isn't that interesting?
[8652.98s -> 8653.94s]  Don't you think that was interesting?
[8653.94s -> 8654.50s]  Wonderful.
[8656.24s -> 8656.72s]  Cool, huh?
[8657.52s -> 8659.90s]  Why are you so sad?
[8664.72s -> 8665.20s]  What's wrong?
[8665.84s -> 8668.78s]  You go do whatever you want.
[8669.50s -> 8674.05s]  It's all about the trees.
[8674.05s -> 8674.61s]  And that's fine.
[8675.57s -> 8677.49s]  As long as you gather it and put it in the right spot.
[8681.26s -> 8681.58s]  All right.
[8681.58s -> 8683.42s]  I need, how's the armory looking?
[8683.42s -> 8684.14s]  Not even close.
[8684.78s -> 8688.32s]  The Aztecs want to rule.
[8688.32s -> 8690.24s]  They need the Greeks destroyed.
[8690.88s -> 8700.82s]  I'm just preparing in case I get attacked.
[8701.86s -> 8705.81s]  What the hell was I doing here?
[8705.81s -> 8705.97s]  All right.
[8705.97s -> 8706.61s]  What do we need?
[8706.61s -> 8707.33s]  What are our needs?
[8708.64s -> 8709.76s]  Food, more food.
[8710.32s -> 8711.28s]  We have plenty of wood.
[8711.28s -> 8711.92s]  More food.
[8715.78s -> 8716.26s]  How can we?
[8718.69s -> 8720.77s]  We need more farmers.
[8721.65s -> 8723.25s]  How many people are actually farming right now?
[8724.88s -> 8725.68s]  Zero out of seven.
[8726.91s -> 8727.79s]  One out of five.
[8729.22s -> 8730.18s]  One out of eight.
[8730.18s -> 8730.90s]  How the fuck?
[8735.34s -> 8736.70s]  We need more farms.
[8737.74s -> 8738.30s]  Get over here.
[8747.41s -> 8748.29s]  Your cow is eating them.
[8748.29s -> 8749.57s]  No, he's fine.
[8749.57s -> 8750.45s]  He's just dancing.
[8756.40s -> 8757.60s]  Look, they're having a good time.
[8759.92s -> 8760.40s]  Is he growing?
[8761.52s -> 8764.99s]  All right.
[8764.99s -> 8766.43s]  Let this guy hang out and be happy.
[8768.10s -> 8768.50s]  Yeah.
[8768.50s -> 8769.14s]  This split.
[8769.14s -> 8770.26s]  I'm glad this splits back.
[8771.46s -> 8772.02s]  More farmers.
[8775.44s -> 8775.68s]  All right.
[8775.68s -> 8779.20s]  Now we got a lot of workers in the field.
[8780.78s -> 8780.94s]  All right.
[8780.94s -> 8782.78s]  We have at least 10 people doing this.
[8783.66s -> 8787.10s]  The Greeks mock us with their very existence.
[8788.42s -> 8789.46s]  You're going to deposit?
[8790.59s -> 8791.23s]  Deposit rock.
[8795.15s -> 8796.67s]  That was whatever.
[8797.39s -> 8800.11s]  Should I turn these rocks around with some poo?
[8803.44s -> 8803.76s]  Sure.
[8804.94s -> 8807.50s]  Poo on the rocks if that's really what you want to do.
[8808.22s -> 8811.97s]  In fact, it's better if you poo on the rocks and not on people
[8811.97s -> 8813.57s]  because people will be very upset by that.
[8813.57s -> 8815.57s]  So if you have to go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom behind a tree.
[8816.13s -> 8817.49s]  Should I poo on that villager?
[8818.64s -> 8820.72s]  No, don't poo on a villager.
[8821.68s -> 8823.95s]  You just asked it to poo on a rock.
[8824.51s -> 8826.03s]  Why are you asking this question now?
[8826.03s -> 8828.35s]  I just told you to poo on a rock.
[8839.65s -> 8840.13s]  I can't.
[8840.13s -> 8840.61s]  All right.
[8840.61s -> 8843.41s]  This curiosity is killing me right now.
[8844.21s -> 8845.17s]  What does this even mean?
[8846.29s -> 8848.85s]  He doesn't actually poop on them, right?
[8849.57s -> 8855.76s]  He's lying.
[8858.88s -> 8859.76s]  He can't get it.
[8882.29s -> 8883.17s]  Clean up the poo.
[8884.86s -> 8885.90s]  Oh, he just hit his head.
[8885.90s -> 8886.46s]  Are you all right?
[8887.46s -> 8887.70s]  All right.
[8888.42s -> 8889.22s]  Let's keep going.
[8889.86s -> 8891.26s]  I'm going to gather food.
[8891.26s -> 8891.90s]  Good work.
[8891.90s -> 8892.30s]  Yes.
[8892.30s -> 8892.70s]  Excellent.
[8893.42s -> 8894.64s]  How are we doing on food?
[8894.64s -> 8895.12s]  Doing okay?
[8897.47s -> 8898.59s]  My military is almost ready.
[8899.31s -> 8901.68s]  I need more food.
[8901.68s -> 8902.48s]  I need another farm.
[8903.12s -> 8904.00s]  I need more farms.
[8904.00s -> 8905.36s]  Like more people.
[8906.08s -> 8907.90s]  How are we doing on population?
[8907.90s -> 8911.57s]  Sleep.
[8911.57s -> 8912.05s]  Where's my?
[8912.69s -> 8913.09s]  Let's see.
[8914.85s -> 8916.05s]  Birth rate low.
[8916.05s -> 8916.29s]  All right.
[8916.29s -> 8917.25s]  We need more fucking.
[8917.25s -> 8919.73s]  They wish to wage war against me.
[8920.93s -> 8922.05s]  So be it.
[8926.85s -> 8931.89s]  The pitiful survivors of the Aztec attack will not last long here.
[8932.53s -> 8935.98s]  Stop eating people.
[8939.18s -> 8939.34s]  All right.
[8939.34s -> 8940.06s]  We got more breeders.
[8940.94s -> 8944.11s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8944.11s -> 8944.43s]  Stop.
[8945.86s -> 8946.50s]  No, I'm trying to.
[8947.55s -> 8949.23s]  Don't eat a villager.
[8951.74s -> 8952.06s]  Don't.
[8952.06s -> 8952.54s]  Okay.
[8952.54s -> 8953.34s]  No villagers.
[8953.98s -> 8958.59s]  I need a new temple.
[8958.59s -> 8959.23s]  What about water?
[8959.23s -> 8961.23s]  That's what you guys doing over here.
[8961.23s -> 8962.70s]  This is doing whole lot of nothing.
[8962.70s -> 8963.34s]  All right.
[8963.34s -> 8963.66s]  Farms?
[8964.22s -> 8965.81s]  Disciple farmer.
[8966.45s -> 8968.03s]  Let's get a military.
[8968.51s -> 8970.64s]  Disciple farmer.
[8970.64s -> 8973.15s]  How many people can I make here though?
[8973.15s -> 8974.99s]  I don't want to destroy the whole economy.
[8975.07s -> 8981.87s]  to build an army click and drag the army flag
[8981.87s -> 8984.88s]  available men 5
[8984.88s -> 8986.88s]  available men 25
[8986.88s -> 8989.63s]  alright I'm gonna do

[8993.09s -> 8995.09s]  10

[9007.22s -> 9010.74s]  breeder breeder breeder
[9010.74s -> 9012.74s]  are they waiting to go into the house to breed?
[9012.74s -> 9014.74s]  I don't understand what they're doing
[9019.41s -> 9021.41s]  the greeks have recruited a platoon
[9021.41s -> 9023.41s]  let's see how it
[9023.41s -> 9025.41s]  fares against
[9025.41s -> 9033.54s]  norse ire
[9033.54s -> 9035.54s]  you can make fields any size you like
[9035.54s -> 9037.54s]  yeah we learned that a few minutes ago we're good
[9037.54s -> 9039.95s]  what are we missing?
[9039.95s -> 9041.95s]  let's put this wood in the store where it belongs
[9041.95s -> 9052.64s]  stray wood everywhere

[9059.81s -> 9061.81s]  alright I got an army I should be okay
[9061.81s -> 9065.07s]  what is this grain?
[9065.07s -> 9073.50s]  watch it
[9073.50s -> 9076.00s]  I'm going to stomp all over that platoon
[9076.00s -> 9079.33s]  is that what you want?
[9079.33s -> 9081.33s]  is that what you want to do?
[9081.33s -> 9088.24s]  you're okay
[9088.24s -> 9090.24s]  no no no that's not worth it
[9090.24s -> 9092.24s]  don't start a war yet I'm not ready

[9104.27s -> 9106.27s]  there's no gate here
[9106.27s -> 9110.22s]  can I make a gate?
[9110.22s -> 9112.22s]  gate house
[9112.22s -> 9115.81s]  they just stuck back here
[9115.81s -> 9120.93s]  what the hell are they gonna do over here?
[9120.93s -> 9122.93s]  if they waste all that money they're not gonna get in
[9122.93s -> 9128.43s]  can't do anything
[9128.43s -> 9131.63s]  let me do this one more time
[9139.52s -> 9144.26s]  I think it's time to leave
[9144.26s -> 9147.58s]  we're gonna go together what do you have?
[9147.58s -> 9152.26s]  nothing really
[9152.26s -> 9154.26s]  there's one army running around that's it
[9154.26s -> 9160.14s]  what about over here?
[9160.14s -> 9162.14s]  I think I can take this

[10671.76s -> 10675.98s]  torture pit?
[10675.98s -> 10680.40s]  do I need like an altar or something?
[10680.40s -> 10682.40s]  I have all this stuff, don't I?
[10682.40s -> 10689.89s]  I guess I'll put an altar in here
[10689.89s -> 10693.65s]  they don't have one
[10697.65s -> 10703.66s]  you gotta buy it
[10703.66s -> 10710.00s]  and just getting some influence
[10710.00s -> 10716.02s]  they have wood in the store room
[10716.02s -> 10718.02s]  so I should probably use the wood in the store room
[10718.02s -> 10721.34s]  I'm going to have some fun
[10721.34s -> 10724.29s]  playing with that tree
[10724.29s -> 10730.18s]  good, you have to be evil to
[10730.18s -> 10732.18s]  get it
[10732.18s -> 10741.39s]  that makes sense
[10741.39s -> 10744.91s]  let me get some worshippers in here
[10744.91s -> 10746.91s]  I'm going to influence these two and I'm not going to have to do anything
[10746.91s -> 10754.08s]  I'm not going to have to fight anybody
[10754.08s -> 10757.79s]  who's available?
[10757.79s -> 10760.61s]  you are
[10760.61s -> 10762.61s]  you are available
[10762.61s -> 10766.64s]  ready?
[10776.24s -> 10778.24s]  are there any side quests that I missed?
[10778.24s -> 10781.76s]  I haven't seen any
[10781.76s -> 10783.76s]  should I work out using trees?
[10783.76s -> 10786.51s]  yeah, yeah, yeah
[10786.51s -> 10788.82s]  I'm going to, yeah, weight lift the tree
[10788.82s -> 10795.60s]  that's way better than a person
[10795.60s -> 10797.60s]  it weighs like 5,000 times more than a person
[10797.60s -> 10808.21s]  maybe he'll get big
[10808.21s -> 10810.21s]  muscles, alright, let's do another
[10810.21s -> 10816.42s]  more houses, put them down here
[10816.42s -> 10818.42s]  start our influence campaign this way
[10818.42s -> 10825.39s]  and then that way
[10825.39s -> 10836.98s]  get a shit load of wood, put it over here
[10836.98s -> 10840.94s]  why is this evil?
[10840.94s -> 10845.09s]  is he going to lift it?
[10845.09s -> 10847.09s]  do some exercises, you need to get bigger and stronger
[10847.09s -> 10856.80s]  he doesn't get it
[10856.80s -> 10861.02s]  should I eat rocks
[10861.02s -> 10863.02s]  or are they bad for my teeth?
[10863.02s -> 10865.02s]  no, no, no, don't eat rocks
[10865.02s -> 10867.02s]  I'm going to eat that rock, don't eat a rock
[10867.02s -> 10869.02s]  no
[10869.02s -> 10872.86s]  no, I'm trying to
[10872.86s -> 10875.17s]  I'm trying to tell you
[10875.17s -> 10877.17s]  don't eat rocks
[10879.17s -> 10887.17s]  oh my god
[10887.17s -> 10889.78s]  don't eat
[10889.78s -> 10891.78s]  rocks
[10891.78s -> 10893.78s]  don't eat rocks
[10893.78s -> 10896.34s]  don't eat rocks
[10896.34s -> 10898.34s]  don't eat rocks
[10898.34s -> 10900.34s]  don't eat rocks
[10900.34s -> 10903.86s]  I'm trying to be gentle
[10903.86s -> 10910.58s]  don't eat rocks
[10910.58s -> 10913.46s]  eat food
[10913.46s -> 10915.46s]  I wonder if I could fit that toy in my mouth
[10922.35s -> 10924.35s]  I wonder if I could fit the toy
[10924.35s -> 10926.35s]  in my mouth
[10926.35s -> 10928.35s]  sentences said before disaster
[10928.35s -> 10932.58s]  he lost track
[10932.58s -> 10940.38s]  of what he was doing
[10940.38s -> 10942.88s]  let him learn
[10942.88s -> 10945.82s]  we're going to be at the doctor
[10945.82s -> 10949.15s]  he's going to end up with a marble in his nose
[10951.15s -> 10957.55s]  even more
[10957.55s -> 10959.73s]  let's keep going
[10959.73s -> 10961.73s]  I don't know
[10961.73s -> 10970.54s]  armory, put it back a little
[10970.54s -> 10973.36s]  oh yes
[10973.36s -> 10975.36s]  armory's turned weedy men into
[10975.36s -> 10977.79s]  warriors
[10977.79s -> 10979.79s]  I need the wood
[10979.79s -> 10981.79s]  I need 500 ore
[10983.79s -> 10987.23s]  how's eat rocks
[10987.23s -> 10989.23s]  good for their digestion, I don't think that's real
[10989.23s -> 10992.75s]  I think what you're saying is inaccurate
[10992.75s -> 10998.77s]  keep it going
[10998.77s -> 11006.90s]  I'm slowly going to encroach
[11006.90s -> 11008.90s]  I'm just building power plants up into their base
[11008.90s -> 11028.22s]  do the quests
[11028.22s -> 11031.42s]  I was trying to look and see if there are any on the
[11031.42s -> 11034.24s]  oh you're talking about just like little tasks
[11034.24s -> 11036.24s]  at the top left
[11036.24s -> 11039.50s]  let's check it out, let's see what they are
[11039.50s -> 11042.13s]  what do they got for us
[11042.13s -> 11047.76s]  how do I see the tasks
[11047.76s -> 11057.87s]  dwellings
[11057.87s -> 11059.87s]  civic buildings
[11059.87s -> 11061.87s]  how do I see the
[11061.87s -> 11066.74s]  tasks
[11066.74s -> 11072.18s]  they pop up sometimes
[11072.18s -> 11075.70s]  oh shit
[11075.70s -> 11078.06s]  eat some food, you can have food
[11078.06s -> 11080.06s]  don't feel like you're stealing
[11080.06s -> 11083.33s]  you can have as much as you want
[11083.33s -> 11091.01s]  I need ore, is this ore
[11091.01s -> 11093.25s]  there's no ore over there
[11093.25s -> 11100.27s]  I have to take some from here
[11100.27s -> 11102.27s]  wait 500
[11102.27s -> 11106.94s]  that's enough
[11106.94s -> 11110.27s]  where's my mouse
[11117.20s -> 11119.20s]  keep that influence going
[11119.20s -> 11121.82s]  what do you guys think about me now
[11121.82s -> 11126.67s]  that's what you think
[11129.10s -> 11133.26s]  where's my army
[11133.26s -> 11135.26s]  I'm going to have two armies
[11135.26s -> 11142.24s]  do I not have enough men
[11142.24s -> 11150.94s]  I don't have enough men
[11150.94s -> 11155.09s]  shit
[11155.09s -> 11157.09s]  we need to do some breeding
[11162.91s -> 11165.47s]  peace through power
[11165.47s -> 11167.47s]  peace with power
[11167.47s -> 11169.47s]  I'm going to try
[11169.47s -> 11171.47s]  but
[11171.47s -> 11174.54s]  is it going to really do much
[11174.54s -> 11176.54s]  what are you doing
[11176.54s -> 11180.37s]  get out of there
[11180.37s -> 11182.37s]  eat some food, I'll give it to you
[11182.37s -> 11187.94s]  eat that
[11187.94s -> 11193.36s]  eat it
[11193.36s -> 11195.36s]  you know you want to, here
[11195.36s -> 11201.94s]  it's delicious
[11201.94s -> 11203.94s]  it smells good
[11203.94s -> 11205.94s]  eat it
[11205.94s -> 11207.94s]  should I beat up those animals
[11207.94s -> 11212.48s]  what animals
[11212.48s -> 11215.49s]  there are no animals here
[11215.49s -> 11218.24s]  beat up an animal, where's an animal
[11218.24s -> 11243.01s]  oh the rabbit
[11243.01s -> 11245.38s]  what a dick
[11245.38s -> 11247.38s]  if you're hungry eat
[11247.38s -> 11249.38s]  where are you putting wood over here
[11249.38s -> 11251.94s]  there's no reason for him to do this
[11251.94s -> 11255.07s]  I'm going to gather wood
[11255.07s -> 11258.66s]  good work
[11258.66s -> 11260.66s]  I'm going to play with the villager
[11260.66s -> 11262.66s]  he's just taking wood from the storehouse
[11262.66s -> 11268.99s]  I'm putting it outside the storehouse
[11268.99s -> 11275.39s]  he's alive
[11275.39s -> 11277.39s]  let's keep going
[11277.39s -> 11279.82s]  I was doing breeding
[11279.82s -> 11282.19s]  do I have enough
[11282.19s -> 11285.63s]  available men
[11285.63s -> 11287.63s]  let's go with
[11287.63s -> 11290.90s]  platoon size
[11290.90s -> 11296.70s]  10
[11296.70s -> 11298.70s]  they're right here
[11298.70s -> 11301.33s]  I don't think he even has a creature
[11301.33s -> 11304.40s]  does he have a creature
[11304.40s -> 11308.18s]  10 in here
[11308.18s -> 11310.18s]  he does, where is it
[11310.18s -> 11313.95s]  I haven't seen it once
[11313.95s -> 11318.82s]  curious I need you over here
[11318.82s -> 11320.82s]  what do you have, put it down
[11320.82s -> 11323.95s]  rabbit, wait what are you doing with this
[11323.95s -> 11325.95s]  I'm kind of curious actually
[11325.95s -> 11329.41s]  bringing it back to the house
[11339.12s -> 11341.12s]  there's just trees
[11341.12s -> 11344.64s]  there's just trees in here
[11344.64s -> 11346.64s]  I'm going to keep him in there
[11346.64s -> 11348.64s]  because he keeps putting them in
[11348.64s -> 11350.64s]  I'm just going to let him
[11350.64s -> 11352.64s]  I'm going to let him keep doing
[11352.64s -> 11354.64s]  what did he just do
[11354.64s -> 11356.64s]  he just screamed at him
[11356.64s -> 11360.86s]  he's so fucked up
[11360.86s -> 11365.41s]  okay watch
[11365.41s -> 11367.41s]  he's just
[11367.41s -> 11369.41s]  I'm going to let him keep fucking doing this
[11369.41s -> 11371.41s]  he's going to keep putting trees in his house
[11371.41s -> 11374.22s]  until it's impossible to walk
[11374.22s -> 11379.15s]  I'm going to just let him be a weirdo
[11379.15s -> 11387.34s]  but more importantly
[11387.34s -> 11390.67s]  come here
[11390.67s -> 11392.67s]  I need you to be a soldier
[11392.67s -> 11397.41s]  at level 2 now, good
[11397.41s -> 11399.41s]  alright
[11399.41s -> 11409.65s]  let's make a move
[11409.65s -> 11420.34s]  level 2, attach him to the arm, he's not going to attack them right
[11420.34s -> 11422.70s]  the morale has been increased
[11422.70s -> 11429.42s]  oh that was a
[11429.42s -> 11431.42s]  battle cry, let's get in there

[11521.07s -> 11523.44s]  put him down
[11523.44s -> 11525.44s]  he's petting him

[11527.74s -> 11532.99s]  alright let's take it over

[11555.38s -> 11558.06s]  help take it over, I need to make another
[11558.06s -> 11560.06s]  he's blowing a kiss
[11560.06s -> 11568.13s]  to the building
[11568.13s -> 11570.30s]  alright is he going to capture
[11570.30s -> 11573.31s]  I don't think he can
[11573.31s -> 11576.32s]  I don't even know what to say
[11576.32s -> 11578.32s]  I'm going to build that structure
[11578.32s -> 11580.32s]  wait he's going to go over here
[11580.32s -> 11582.32s]  and help build this

[11602.93s -> 11605.10s]  entertain them while we
[11605.10s -> 11614.32s]  conquer them
[11614.32s -> 11626.29s]  entertain them, this doesn't seem very
[11626.29s -> 11629.04s]  entertaining
[11629.04s -> 11637.68s]  who's he playing with
[11637.68s -> 11640.69s]  I'm going to go and gather that free

[11644.34s -> 11646.34s]  anymore, it's too
[11646.34s -> 11651.33s]  he's so all over the place
[11651.33s -> 11653.33s]  I hope he brings it all the way back to his house
[11653.33s -> 11655.33s]  please do that
[11655.33s -> 11659.10s]  no he's just an idiot

[11776.10s -> 11778.10s]  in the meantime I'm going to start building out this way
[11778.10s -> 11781.68s]  Murius can sleep for a little bit
[11781.68s -> 11783.86s]  let's continue building out here
[11783.86s -> 11788.85s]  and let's do a water spill
[11788.85s -> 11790.85s]  how's this town look
[11790.85s -> 11793.90s]  good, I think we're good
[11793.90s -> 11797.23s]  you go worship here
[11797.23s -> 11799.23s]  everyone worship here, that's not doing anything
[11799.23s -> 11802.82s]  alright, Murius is awake
[11805.89s -> 11807.89s]  nice trees, okay

[13035.58s -> 13037.58s]  oh my goodness, we're going from here
[13037.58s -> 13039.58s]  we have to throw it across the whole thing
[13039.58s -> 13042.66s]  oh, this is gonna actually
[13042.66s -> 13044.66s]  suck, okay, so
[13044.66s -> 13048.30s]  I hear
[13048.30s -> 13050.30s]  Murius is kicking shit
[13050.30s -> 13053.50s]  okay, so now let's go from
[13053.50s -> 13065.90s]  this is
[13065.90s -> 13076.72s]  what's up with the ticking?
[13076.72s -> 13079.92s]  I'm ticking over a town
[13079.92s -> 13082.10s]  currently ticking over a town
[13082.10s -> 13085.81s]  Murius is kicking shit
[13085.81s -> 13090.35s]  sweet
[13090.35s -> 13092.35s]  praise be, the brew is finished
[13092.35s -> 13094.35s]  let's drink it, lads
[13094.35s -> 13096.35s]  but first, a tribute
[13096.35s -> 13098.35s]  to our benefactor
[13098.35s -> 13104.16s]  hooray
[13104.16s -> 13106.16s]  yeah, I got one guy taking a town over
[13106.16s -> 13109.49s]  currently, wrong button
[13109.49s -> 13112.24s]  I was trying to press this button
[13112.24s -> 13114.67s]  I thought that was the camera button
[13114.67s -> 13119.26s]  to the same spot
[13119.26s -> 13128.42s]  where the camera button usually is
[13128.42s -> 13130.42s]  is this where I guess it was?
[13130.42s -> 13133.62s]  20,000 points
[13133.62s -> 13135.62s]  all right, now, Murius, where are you?
[13135.62s -> 13138.86s]  I'm soaking
[13138.86s -> 13140.86s]  good, and you need to take this place open, you need to hang out
[13140.86s -> 13145.47s]  oh, he's wrecking this place
[13145.47s -> 13147.47s]  all right, you don't need to wreck this place
[13147.47s -> 13149.47s]  just be an entertainer for a little while
[13149.47s -> 13154.21s]  entertain this person
[13154.21s -> 13156.21s]  that's the last person that you haven't killed
[13165.36s -> 13174.13s]  I'm so happy
[13174.13s -> 13176.13s]  evil, evil, evil
[13176.13s -> 13184.70s]  this is still working
[13184.70s -> 13186.70s]  boy, are they rebuilding the town as he destroys it?
[13186.70s -> 13188.70s]  that's kind of fucked up
[13188.70s -> 13191.58s]  well, he's on happy mode
[13191.58s -> 13196.70s]  so
[13196.70s -> 13198.70s]  yes, hi, I see you, hello
[13198.70s -> 13202.53s]  wait, what is that?
[13202.53s -> 13206.43s]  is that the pot?
[13206.43s -> 13209.38s]  I guess not, I almost have it
[13209.38s -> 13217.10s]  I think peekaboo
[13217.10s -> 13219.10s]  first thing that's getting built here is a creature town
[13219.10s -> 13226.91s]  well, it's a pot market
[13226.91s -> 13237.41s]  how come I can't build a pot market?
[13241.41s -> 13244.03s]  all right, you can hang, I need a creature
[13244.03s -> 13246.03s]  city, second, this is ready
[13246.03s -> 13249.04s]  no, no, don't, no
[13249.04s -> 13251.04s]  Murius, no, no, no, no, put him down, put him down
[13251.04s -> 13253.04s]  I need this guy, no, put him down, no, no, no
[13253.04s -> 13255.04s]  put him down, put him down, put him down
[13255.04s -> 13260.54s]  put him down, put him down, put him down
[13260.54s -> 13262.54s]  I got it, okay, I got it
[13262.54s -> 13264.54s]  put him down
[13264.54s -> 13266.54s]  put him down
[13266.54s -> 13268.54s]  put him down, put him down, put him down
[13268.54s -> 13270.54s]  I got the town, right? Okay
[13270.54s -> 13273.55s]  I was gonna say, that's the only guy capturing the city
[13273.55s -> 13275.55s]  no, you don't have to play with the villager, just relax
[13275.55s -> 13282.02s]  I need a creature den
[13282.02s -> 13289.82s]  put you anywhere
[13289.82s -> 13295.90s]  help me build this building, Murius
[13295.90s -> 13298.53s]  they don't have shit though, they have nothing
[13298.53s -> 13300.77s]  they have a little bit of wood
[13300.77s -> 13313.55s]  actually, they got quite a bit
[13313.55s -> 13315.55s]  good, gather
[13315.55s -> 13317.55s]  fields
[13317.55s -> 13320.30s]  good job, Murius, we need to maybe rebuild some of this stuff
[13320.30s -> 13322.30s]  how are the townspeople doing? breed
[13324.30s -> 13328.14s]  any forests around here?
[13328.14s -> 13330.14s]  I need a mine
[13330.14s -> 13332.14s]  you can get this
[13332.14s -> 13335.07s]  I'm kind of evil
[13335.07s -> 13337.07s]  only that? 7% is not bad
[13337.07s -> 13344.69s]  they're pooing on the rocks?
[13344.69s -> 13346.69s]  there are no rocks
[13351.23s -> 13353.23s]  uh, forester
[13353.23s -> 13355.23s]  disciple forester
[13355.23s -> 13357.23s]  forester
[13357.23s -> 13359.23s]  disciple forester
[13359.23s -> 13361.23s]  I need a farm, let's do a big
[13361.23s -> 13364.69s]  just one huge ass farm over here
[13364.69s -> 13368.34s]  this, just one, who cares
[13368.34s -> 13377.17s]  just one big ass farm
[13377.17s -> 13380.50s]  disciple farmer
[13380.50s -> 13382.50s]  disciple farmer
[13382.50s -> 13384.93s]  all people standing around, get in there
[13384.93s -> 13388.83s]  disciple farmer
[13388.83s -> 13391.33s]  disciple farmer
[13391.33s -> 13395.74s]  all right, now we should start to get some good shit
[13395.74s -> 13397.74s]  breeders are over there
[13397.74s -> 13399.74s]  there is, okay, there's ore over here, good
[13399.74s -> 13404.29s]  oh, you think you're gonna come in here, don't you?
[13404.29s -> 13406.72s]  well, I got a fix for that
[13406.72s -> 13413.38s]  you're quite happy?
[13413.38s -> 13415.38s]  good, you're about to be even more
[13415.38s -> 13418.13s]  happy, attack
[13418.13s -> 13423.49s]  what do you have in your hand?
[13423.49s -> 13426.30s]  what is that? he has
[13426.30s -> 13431.42s]  grain in his hands?
[13431.42s -> 13433.42s]  not much, but
[13433.42s -> 13435.42s]  you're doing fine
[13435.42s -> 13439.12s]  get him
[13441.12s -> 13443.12s]  all right, pick up tree, throw tree
[13450.24s -> 13453.18s]  are they hiding in the trees?
[13453.18s -> 13455.18s]  all right, throw, throw at them
[13455.18s -> 13466.82s]  crush them
[13466.82s -> 13472.00s]  can he reach from here?
[13474.43s -> 13476.74s]  attack, attack with your new melee weapon
[13476.74s -> 13486.78s]  tree
[13486.78s -> 13490.56s]  get him, attack
[13490.56s -> 13492.56s]  holy shit, he does use it
[13492.56s -> 13494.56s]  he uses it as a fucking weapon
[13494.56s -> 13509.84s]  run him out of town
[13509.84s -> 13511.84s]  holy shit, that's so dangerous
[13511.84s -> 13513.84s]  that's so dangerous, get him out of here
[13513.84s -> 13518.32s]  get him out, get him out
[13518.32s -> 13526.32s]  he's gonna kill everybody
[13530.88s -> 13532.88s]  go after them
[13532.88s -> 13534.88s]  what?
[13534.88s -> 13542.99s]  where?
[13542.99s -> 13544.99s]  where, what, I don't understand, where am I getting attacked?
[13544.99s -> 13549.28s]  all right, just throw it
[13549.28s -> 13555.94s]  here we go

[13563.20s -> 13571.97s]  where was this other attack going on?
[13571.97s -> 13576.19s]  I think it's only just right here
[13576.19s -> 13578.19s]  throw downhill, he wouldn't throw it
[13578.19s -> 13582.29s]  there was nothing to throw
[13582.29s -> 13584.29s]  they're just running away from it
[13584.29s -> 13592.10s]  Murius, Murius, Murius
[13592.10s -> 13594.10s]  Murius, Murius, please
[13598.10s -> 13601.30s]  all right, pick up a fucking tree
[13601.30s -> 13603.86s]  I'm gonna throw it
[13603.86s -> 13605.86s]  how do you throw something, throw
[13605.86s -> 13609.57s]  all right, throw it, throw

[13647.14s -> 13652.96s]  oh my god
[13652.96s -> 13654.96s]  Murius, what the fuck are you doing?
[13654.96s -> 13659.95s]  they're like dragging him
[13659.95s -> 13662.26s]  finally
[13662.26s -> 13664.26s]  you stepped on somebody
[13664.26s -> 13672.24s]  he'll kill them eventually
[13672.24s -> 13677.42s]  what was I doing?
[13677.42s -> 13679.42s]  the town is coming under attack
[13679.42s -> 13681.42s]  the Aztecs want to rule
[13681.42s -> 13683.42s]  they need the Greeks destroyed
[13683.42s -> 13688.21s]  how do I throw?
[13688.21s -> 13690.21s]  I can't change the throw
[13696.29s -> 13698.29s]  throw, this hurt somebody
[13698.29s -> 13700.29s]  do something Murius
[13700.29s -> 13710.46s]  you're fucking killing me
[13710.46s -> 13712.46s]  you gotta do something
[13712.46s -> 13714.46s]  don't I have an army?
[13714.46s -> 13717.02s]  do I have to make a new army?
[13717.02s -> 13719.02s]  attack, attack, attack
[13719.02s -> 13725.98s]  he killed somebody
[13725.98s -> 13727.98s]  he's just wrecking this town too
[13727.98s -> 13730.74s]  just defend this area
[13730.74s -> 13732.74s]  there's no reason for you to run around in circles
[13732.74s -> 13735.04s]  just defend, defend
[13735.04s -> 13737.79s]  I'm gonna go get my actual army
[13737.79s -> 13739.79s]  there's a home digger of a fight going on
[13739.79s -> 13743.12s]  no there's not
[13743.12s -> 13745.12s]  give me my actual fucking army and just defend over here

[13753.95s -> 13795.47s]  defend the town
[13795.47s -> 13798.74s]  defend the town
[13798.74s -> 13800.74s]  being a soldier, do something
[13800.74s -> 13807.39s]  they just run in and run out
[13807.39s -> 13810.02s]  Murius, get them
[13810.02s -> 13814.75s]  get them
[13814.75s -> 13820.58s]  alright, my actual team is here
[13820.58s -> 13825.63s]  this is like the stupidest army ever
[13825.63s -> 13827.63s]  they're just running in circles
[13827.63s -> 13831.02s]  absolutely decimated
[13831.02s -> 13839.54s]  just decimated
[13839.54s -> 13841.90s]  time for a counter attack
[13843.90s -> 13845.90s]  every time we do
[13845.90s -> 13847.90s]  Greeks are a strong force
[13847.90s -> 13851.30s]  I cannot tolerate these Greeks any longer
[13851.30s -> 13853.30s]  let's go
[13853.30s -> 13856.88s]  I will have to act
[13856.88s -> 13858.88s]  Murius
[13858.88s -> 13860.88s]  this is North's land
[13860.88s -> 13864.78s]  no intruders must be allowed
[13864.78s -> 13866.78s]  free will, he's alright
[13866.78s -> 13870.75s]  instead of wink it's turning into just like
[13870.75s -> 13883.92s]  stay together
[13883.92s -> 13885.92s]  it's time to go kill this motherfucker
[13885.92s -> 13891.04s]  he's streaming in a cave
[13891.04s -> 13893.04s]  yes, yes
[13893.04s -> 13908.45s]  you know what, sleep for now
[13908.45s -> 13913.95s]  you guys hang out here for a little bit
[13913.95s -> 13918.11s]  this should be enough to take the other city
[13918.11s -> 13921.38s]  what else do we got?
[13921.38s -> 13923.38s]  take a little rest
[13923.38s -> 13925.38s]  let's get some food for Murius
[13925.38s -> 13928.13s]  and then we're gonna go in
[13928.13s -> 13930.13s]  this is his stronghold here
[13930.13s -> 13934.35s]  he does have
[13934.35s -> 13936.35s]  look at how much of a little baby this is though
[13936.35s -> 13938.35s]  Murius is going to
[13938.35s -> 13940.35s]  karate chop this guy in the head
[13940.35s -> 13942.35s]  and instantly knock him out
[13942.35s -> 13954.13s]  this is gonna be awesome
[13954.13s -> 13956.13s]  he doesn't stand a chance
[13956.13s -> 13959.58s]  I got like 5 towns
[13959.58s -> 13966.43s]  get some rest
[13966.43s -> 13968.43s]  health 58
[13968.43s -> 13970.43s]  can I heal these guys?
[13970.43s -> 13972.99s]  can they like rest?
[13972.99s -> 13974.99s]  is there a way to like heal them
[13974.99s -> 13976.99s]  or feed them or something

[14080.22s -> 14082.22s]  Murius go in
[14082.22s -> 14084.85s]  we might get a creature fight here
[14084.85s -> 14086.85s]  which I have to be prepared for
[14086.85s -> 14098.43s]  let's get a morale boost

[14741.14s -> 14743.50s]  there's no attack door
[14743.50s -> 14745.50s]  I can't do it
[14745.50s -> 14748.83s]  I think only he can

[14752.86s -> 14754.86s]  oh my god
[14754.86s -> 14757.04s]  I didn't, I thought they could attack the fucking door
[14757.04s -> 14759.04s]  I didn't think only he could
[14759.04s -> 14761.04s]  everyone's dead
[14763.04s -> 14765.04s]  load the game, load the game

[15160.59s -> 15175.57s]  we need a lot of soldiers
[15175.57s -> 15179.73s]  even back here
[15179.73s -> 15181.73s]  it doesn't matter if it's ugly
[15181.73s -> 15185.82s]  it just has to work, this has to exist
[15185.82s -> 15187.82s]  I'll get a road back here eventually

[15241.17s -> 15244.30s]  I'll let this play out for a little bit
[15244.30s -> 15250.70s]  I just tried to breed this guy with a pig
[15250.70s -> 15252.70s]  okay, that's not gonna work

[15802.53s -> 15804.53s]  let's go in the front door

[15806.53s -> 15812.29s]  going in the door that's open
[15812.29s -> 15827.06s]  we're going in the door that's open
[15827.06s -> 15829.06s]  okay, there's tons of people up here now
[15829.06s -> 15833.02s]  let me make a torture pit
[15833.02s -> 15835.02s]  so we can literally just
[15835.02s -> 15837.02s]  when they come in, just pick them up and put them in here
[15837.02s -> 15840.21s]  and just torture them
[15840.21s -> 15855.06s]  I don't even need that much
[15855.06s -> 15857.06s]  I need ore
[15857.06s -> 15860.00s]  alright, so this is done
[15860.00s -> 15862.93s]  how does this work?
[15862.93s -> 15868.69s]  just pick somebody and put them in
[15868.69s -> 15870.86s]  so do I have to train this
[15870.86s -> 15872.86s]  or is Murius already leveled up
[15872.86s -> 15874.86s]  like the advanced soldier, or do I have to do something about that
[15874.86s -> 15881.71s]  do I have to put it somewhere
[15881.71s -> 15883.71s]  already upgraded, nice, okay, good
[15883.71s -> 15885.71s]  no, no, no, no, no
[15885.71s -> 15887.71s]  you can snack on the grain
[15887.71s -> 15889.71s]  snack on the grain, but don't run in
[15889.71s -> 15891.71s]  this door is open, we're going to go in the open door
[15891.71s -> 15895.81s]  army is here
[15895.81s -> 15898.62s]  now, do I
[15898.62s -> 15900.62s]  don't tear down those walls
[15900.62s -> 15905.81s]  stay here, let's get some archers
[15905.81s -> 15918.10s]  don't eat a villager
[15918.10s -> 15920.10s]  don't eat a villager
[15920.10s -> 15922.10s]  are they hitting them?
[15922.10s -> 15928.61s]  are they hitting them?
[15928.61s -> 15930.61s]  alright, do not eat a villager
[15930.61s -> 15932.85s]  here, eat this instead

[15999.18s -> 16001.18s]  we gotta get going, I need archers
[16001.18s -> 16007.20s]  once that's done, I'm just going
[16007.20s -> 16015.78s]  in the fucking back door
[16019.09s -> 16024.27s]  what, I just throw that
[16026.27s -> 16028.27s]  is that going to be seen as an attack, because I was not ready to attack
[16028.27s -> 16031.09s]  is that an attack
[16031.09s -> 16036.27s]  we share the hatred
[16036.27s -> 16038.27s]  for the Greeks that our Aztec
[16038.27s -> 16041.86s]  masters have
[16041.86s -> 16043.86s]  what in the name of fucking god are you guys

[16046.35s -> 16052.82s]  what the hell are you doing
[16052.82s -> 16054.82s]  this is like, this is just
[16054.82s -> 16056.82s]  nonsense
[16056.82s -> 16058.82s]  it's just absolute fucking nonsense
[16058.82s -> 16062.21s]  the town is getting
[16062.21s -> 16077.82s]  mashed up
[16077.82s -> 16086.02s]  you guys lost your damn minds
[16086.02s -> 16088.02s]  wait, wait, wait

[16099.23s -> 16102.88s]  up here
[16102.88s -> 16107.04s]  alright, well fucking settle down
[16107.04s -> 16109.34s]  you guys are making me anxious
[16109.34s -> 16113.12s]  what the hell is going on over here
[16113.12s -> 16115.12s]  this is not even like typical crack chat night
[16115.12s -> 16117.12s]  this is just like, writing random
[16117.12s -> 16120.38s]  words

[16140.00s -> 16142.00s]  not enough ore, what the fuck are you talking about
[16142.00s -> 16153.18s]  how do I not have ore for this
[16153.18s -> 16155.18s]  something is currently being taken
[16155.18s -> 16158.58s]  okay
[16158.58s -> 16184.69s]  what are you guys doing
[16184.69s -> 16190.56s]  alright, quell it

[16197.15s -> 16199.15s]  quell it, quell it, quell it, quell it, quell it
[16199.15s -> 16209.39s]  two minute slow mode at least
[16209.39s -> 16214.96s]  and keep it on, and keep that shit on

[16238.50s -> 16240.50s]  to play
[16240.50s -> 16243.31s]  I don't have
[16243.31s -> 16245.31s]  any soldiers here
[16245.31s -> 16247.31s]  is it any soldiers at all
[16247.31s -> 16251.15s]  how far away is that from Urius
[16251.15s -> 16253.15s]  I don't care about that town anymore
[16253.15s -> 16257.44s]  I have fucking a thousand people, let's go
[16257.44s -> 16259.44s]  I need archers, but I don't know what I need
[16259.44s -> 16261.44s]  or a number of troops
[16261.44s -> 16263.44s]  you can create fourteen troops
[16263.44s -> 16265.44s]  okay, let's go, I can do fourteen
[16265.44s -> 16268.00s]  fourteen archers
[16271.46s -> 16273.46s]  I need, we need to go, we gotta go in the front door over here
[16291.20s -> 16293.20s]  we gotta go in and take the whole thing
[16293.20s -> 16296.26s]  save the game here
[16302.19s -> 16304.19s]  what about the archers on the walls
[16304.19s -> 16307.01s]  there's only like three right there

[16393.02s -> 16402.74s]  get in the door
[16402.74s -> 16408.18s]  look at the range, they can't even shoot
[16408.18s -> 16410.18s]  alright, good, good, good, good
[16410.18s -> 16412.18s]  kill these ones too

[16423.98s -> 16428.21s]  what the hell
[16428.21s -> 16431.22s]  pick up flag, drop flag
[16431.22s -> 16433.22s]  oh fuck, come on
[16433.22s -> 16435.84s]  he's picking up a weapon
[16435.84s -> 16437.84s]  he's picking up a weapon
[16437.84s -> 16439.84s]  alright, the door is open, whatever, we're gonna win
[16439.84s -> 16445.09s]  actually, you stay away
[16445.09s -> 16449.81s]  get in
[16449.81s -> 16467.97s]  rage, attack
[16467.97s -> 16469.97s]  move, move, move, move, move, keep moving, new target
[16469.97s -> 16471.97s]  we have to capture, capture, capture
[16471.97s -> 16476.19s]  oh, here we go, this is it
[16476.19s -> 16482.77s]  fight him, fight him
[16482.77s -> 16489.30s]  Murius, get
[16489.30s -> 16491.54s]  Murius, get over there
[16491.54s -> 16493.54s]  throw it free
[16493.54s -> 16495.54s]  Kevin, he's killing everyone
[16495.54s -> 16498.16s]  everyone is dead
[16498.16s -> 16500.59s]  attack him
[16500.59s -> 16502.59s]  attack him, what are you doing
[16502.59s -> 16504.59s]  what are you doing
[16504.59s -> 16506.59s]  you're leashed
[16506.59s -> 16511.33s]  to him
[16511.33s -> 16513.33s]  oh, now you wanna fight
[16513.33s -> 16515.33s]  and now you decide it's time to attack
[16515.33s -> 16517.70s]  he's kicking
[16517.70s -> 16519.70s]  the shit out of me
[16519.70s -> 16521.70s]  fight him
[16521.70s -> 16523.70s]  his archers shoot me in the back too
[16523.70s -> 16525.70s]  god damn it man
[16525.70s -> 16527.70s]  I'm not even hitting the right direction
[16527.70s -> 16529.70s]  what the fuck
[16529.70s -> 16531.70s]  get up
[16531.70s -> 16533.70s]  and fight
[16533.70s -> 16539.46s]  oh my god
[16539.46s -> 16542.53s]  it was a disaster
[16542.53s -> 16544.53s]  reload the game, reload the game
[16544.53s -> 16550.22s]  reload the game
[16550.22s -> 16553.55s]  okay, so I
[16553.55s -> 16555.73s]  walked in
[16555.73s -> 16557.90s]  and he killed everyone
[16557.90s -> 16567.92s]  so
[16567.92s -> 16569.92s]  we're gonna have to rethink this strategy
[16569.92s -> 16580.22s]  so let's go back to where we were
[16580.22s -> 16583.17s]  come back here
[16583.17s -> 16589.63s]  Murius, come back over here
[16589.63s -> 16591.63s]  so
[16591.63s -> 16593.63s]  I'm still being shot with arrows
[16593.63s -> 16599.17s]  oh my god
[16599.17s -> 16601.17s]  why is it so hard
[16601.17s -> 16603.41s]  okay, get over here
[16603.41s -> 16605.41s]  so, the plan here
[16605.41s -> 16607.41s]  the pitiful survivors of the Aztec
[16607.41s -> 16609.41s]  I need to
[16609.41s -> 16611.41s]  stop whippin' fireballs and shit
[16611.41s -> 16613.78s]  we need spells
[16613.78s -> 16615.78s]  so
[16615.78s -> 16617.78s]  I need to build a
[16617.78s -> 16619.78s]  first of all, first of all, first of all, Murius, come with me
[16619.78s -> 16621.78s]  there's currently
[16621.78s -> 16623.78s]  they're taking over a city
[16623.78s -> 16626.08s]  we need you to go over here
[16626.08s -> 16628.08s]  on your soldier
[16630.08s -> 16632.08s]  come over here
[16632.08s -> 16634.08s]  and come
[16634.08s -> 16636.08s]  it's, it's, it's
[16636.08s -> 16638.08s]  one person, I'm kidding
[16638.08s -> 16640.08s]  is it actually just one god damn person
[16640.08s -> 16650.90s]  I don't even know
[16650.90s -> 16665.04s]  where are they
[16665.04s -> 16667.04s]  are they still, who is taking it
[16667.04s -> 16669.04s]  okay, good, okay, very good
[16669.04s -> 16672.62s]  let's go ahead and do that again on the other one
[16672.62s -> 16674.62s]  wherever, okay, good, right
[16674.62s -> 16685.81s]  um
[16685.81s -> 16692.53s]  okay, you know where this got all
[16692.53s -> 16694.53s]  fucked up is where I didn't realize that I had to buy
[16694.53s -> 16696.53s]  the new stuff with tribute
[16696.53s -> 16698.53s]  and it's been like, I did it the whole
[16698.53s -> 16701.22s]  game
[16701.22s -> 16705.25s]  game
[16705.25s -> 16707.25s]  why is chat so slow? uh, because they were
[16707.25s -> 16709.25s]  unruly
[16709.25s -> 16711.25s]  and they had to be quelled
[16711.25s -> 16713.25s]  they had to be stopped
[16713.25s -> 16716.38s]  alright, so
[16716.38s -> 16720.67s]  uh
[16720.67s -> 16722.91s]  what do I wanna do?
[16722.91s -> 16724.91s]  how do I wanna do this? I'm gonna have to
[16724.91s -> 16726.91s]  I pulled all the troops up here, fuck
[16726.91s -> 16731.65s]  alright, I want to
[16731.65s -> 16738.99s]  what are they doing?
[16738.99s -> 16740.99s]  oh, they're putting the fires out
[16740.99s -> 16742.99s]  these people still, you know what?
[16742.99s -> 16744.99s]  I have to, oh, yeah, yeah, I should have made like
[16744.99s -> 16749.47s]  three or four saves
[16749.47s -> 16751.47s]  I'm so far done at this point, like I'm
[16751.47s -> 16753.47s]  fucked
[16753.47s -> 16755.47s]  I need to have rewound like an hour and a half
[16755.47s -> 16758.74s]  and like build other buildings
[16758.74s -> 16760.74s]  I have to just hurt myself, I have to
[16760.74s -> 16763.17s]  and then just go back from
[16763.17s -> 16765.17s]  scratch and build buildings
[16765.17s -> 16767.17s]  I gotta take out a whole city, we gotta torch the city
[16767.17s -> 16772.42s]  it's gotta be done
[16772.42s -> 16788.42s]  alright, we're through from scratch
[16788.42s -> 16794.11s]  are we still getting attacked somewhere?
[16794.11s -> 16796.35s]  that top city is gonna be under attack
[16796.35s -> 16798.35s]  is he alive?
[16798.35s -> 16801.10s]  alright
[16803.10s -> 16805.10s]  so this is how to do fire
[16805.10s -> 16807.10s]  heal
[16807.10s -> 16809.10s]  and now can I just do them in the air like this?
[16809.10s -> 16811.10s]  do I have to press a certain button?
[16811.10s -> 16815.97s]  is there like an activation
[16815.97s -> 16829.73s]  thing that I need to do?
[16829.73s -> 16831.73s]  I was gonna say, can we get rid of the guy that just did all caps
[16831.73s -> 16833.73s]  for like the whole paragraph
[16833.73s -> 16835.73s]  like what the fuck are you doing?
[16835.73s -> 16846.66s]  like what the fuck
[16846.66s -> 16848.66s]  I gotta kill this guy, I gotta take this guy out
[16848.66s -> 16851.98s]  there has to be like an activation right?
[16851.98s -> 16853.98s]  69
[16853.98s -> 16857.89s]  as long as I keep those people up there
[16857.89s -> 16859.89s]  I'm going to
[16859.89s -> 16863.92s]  let's get some archers
[16863.92s -> 16866.10s]  but first let me build
[16866.10s -> 16868.10s]  I took all the able bodied men from
[16868.10s -> 16870.10s]  every community
[16870.10s -> 16872.46s]  oh I royally fucked this
[16872.46s -> 16874.46s]  all up
[16881.47s -> 16883.47s]  let's start some breeding
[16883.47s -> 16897.54s]  this game is a bit hard?
[16897.54s -> 16900.61s]  I mean from it's very nature
[16900.61s -> 16902.61s]  I think it probably is
[16902.61s -> 16904.61s]  what's going on in there?
[16904.61s -> 16906.85s]  can we pull all these people out?
[16906.85s -> 16908.85s]  there's a shit little people in there

[16932.45s -> 16934.45s]  I sent every man to war
[16940.34s -> 16945.01s]  there's no men
[16945.01s -> 16949.04s]  I fucked up all of earth

[17005.33s -> 17017.42s]  but whatever
[17017.42s -> 17019.98s]  that's just the way it is apparently
[17021.98s -> 17026.98s]  chat loves
[17026.98s -> 17028.98s]  slow mo they like to talk about how much
[17028.98s -> 17033.52s]  is their favorite thing
[17033.52s -> 17035.52s]  Dermot please turn up and ban that person
[17035.52s -> 17040.19s]  I'm not even kidding for like at least 10 minutes
[17040.19s -> 17042.88s]  where are they all going?
[17053.90s -> 17057.62s]  oh

[17061.79s -> 17063.79s]  wrong
[17063.79s -> 17065.79s]  and he's so much stronger
[17065.79s -> 17068.67s]  than me

[17075.58s -> 17077.89s]  wait I can spawn a man
[17077.89s -> 17093.82s]  give me like two
[17093.82s -> 17107.84s]  chat is very problematic
[17107.84s -> 17112.43s]  yeah what's going on today?
[17112.43s -> 17114.43s]  what is going on today?

[17149.14s -> 17159.18s]  anyways
[17159.18s -> 17161.18s]  I'm going to continue to pay attention to the video game
[17161.18s -> 17163.18s]  because that's what I'm doing
[17163.18s -> 17165.49s]  throwing rocks
[17165.49s -> 17169.26s]  did it work? alright we're gonna start throwing fireballs
[17169.26s -> 17171.26s]  that's the plan
[17171.26s -> 17176.77s]  Murius get up here
[17176.77s -> 17178.77s]  I need to build a
[17178.77s -> 17180.77s]  we're gonna close this out here
[17180.77s -> 17182.77s]  we're gonna close this one out good
[17182.77s -> 17185.01s]  I need a one of these things
[17185.01s -> 17189.62s]  an altar up here
[17189.62s -> 17191.62s]  with an altar I can just I'm gonna just whip bombs
[17191.62s -> 17204.74s]  across the gate and then we're going in
[17204.74s -> 17207.23s]  make it emote only
[17207.23s -> 17209.23s]  actually you know what
[17209.23s -> 17211.23s]  actually no don't do that
[17211.23s -> 17213.23s]  that's just when they come out of it
[17213.23s -> 17215.23s]  they're gonna be even worse
[17215.23s -> 17217.66s]  you know how that works?
[17217.66s -> 17219.66s]  it's like you're putting like a muzzle on somebody
[17219.66s -> 17221.66s]  and then they just go
[17221.66s -> 17223.66s]  I scream for when this muzzle comes up
[17223.66s -> 17226.10s]  and then the muzzle
[17226.10s -> 17234.16s]  yeah it's just not gonna work
[17234.16s -> 17236.16s]  just never take it off
[17236.16s -> 17238.85s]  that's so bad
[17238.85s -> 17242.50s]  we went better than this
[17242.50s -> 17244.50s]  we shouldn't have to do that
[17244.50s -> 17246.50s]  we shouldn't have to do that we're better than this
[17246.50s -> 17248.50s]  oh man
[17248.50s -> 17250.86s]  aw

[17259.52s -> 17261.52s]  against their puny forces
[17261.52s -> 17264.40s]  stay right here
[17264.40s -> 17266.40s]  stop stop stop stop
[17266.40s -> 17268.64s]  you're gonna get shot with arrows
[17268.64s -> 17273.74s]  first things first
[17273.74s -> 17276.05s]  get everyone ready
[17276.05s -> 17278.05s]  let's torch their whole city

[17315.28s -> 17317.28s]  killed everybody
[17319.28s -> 17323.50s]  slow mode on twitch has an upper limit

[17377.78s -> 17379.78s]  can I break the door down with this?
[17379.78s -> 17392.32s]  I wonder
[17392.32s -> 17409.09s]  it might be time to go in
[17409.09s -> 17413.06s]  it's an allegory for your power in black and white
[17413.06s -> 17415.55s]  what happened to all my friends?
[17415.55s -> 17420.35s]  perfect shot

[17440.99s -> 17442.99s]  to be on soldier mode
[17442.99s -> 17445.42s]  they don't have any more archers so that's good
[17445.42s -> 17449.52s]  break the fucking door down let's go
[17449.52s -> 17451.52s]  you're supposed to bring balance to the force
[17451.52s -> 17457.22s]  not destroy it
[17457.22s -> 17461.31s]  don't care lester

[17463.62s -> 17465.98s]  where do I capture?
[17465.98s -> 17469.44s]  where's the thing to capture?
[17469.44s -> 17472.51s]  attack? where is it?
[17472.51s -> 17480.06s]  right there
[17480.06s -> 17485.74s]  Murius why have you stopped hitting the door?

[17563.28s -> 17582.06s]  What? This is how he's destroying him.
[17587.23s -> 17588.67s]  Holy shit.
[17592.48s -> 17597.04s]  Take the town over. That was pure fucking rage.
[17600.59s -> 17604.83s]  That was rage. Total fucking rage.
[17609.60s -> 17621.55s]  Get it. Get it. Fight. Fight. Fight.
[17624.69s -> 17628.21s]  Mirrius, be careful in here. Mirrius. Mirrius, be careful in here.
[17629.17s -> 17636.29s]  Okay. All right. Mirrius, attack the archers. You're gonna be the block.
[17637.01s -> 17645.62s]  Can we get it? Fire.
[17645.62s -> 17647.22s]  The town is getting destroyed.
[17651.55s -> 17655.15s]  Where? Oh my fucking God. Where is the stupid building?
[17655.15s -> 17656.99s]  What are the gestures? For the love of God.
[17657.71s -> 17676.30s]  Where's the... We need you guys to stay alive.
[17676.94s -> 17681.36s]  Start killing. You can take it in a second.
[17681.36s -> 17688.18s]  You punched that guy to dust.
[17688.18s -> 17688.90s]  Take the town.
[17689.54s -> 17695.44s]  Oh God. How am I gonna capture this shit? They keep pouring people out.
[17696.16s -> 17700.70s]  All right. We're doing 55 fucking men.
[17701.26s -> 17702.85s]  Let's hope I can get them out there in time.
[17703.49s -> 17708.22s]  Mirrius, what are you doing?
[17714.24s -> 17717.44s]  Mirrius, stop fucking hitting that shit and go over and help them.
[17723.25s -> 17730.08s]  Oh fuck. Why are you hitting the wall, Mirrius, of all the things to hit?
[17730.08s -> 17731.20s]  Why would you do the wall?
[17732.08s -> 17734.62s]  There's a guy sitting right here.
[17735.34s -> 17737.74s]  Do it again. Get on top of him and beat his head into the ground.
[17737.74s -> 17740.21s]  Do it. Kick his ass. Kick his ass.
[17742.53s -> 17744.72s]  Get on top of him. Do it.
[17745.36s -> 17751.01s]  Good. Good. Good.
[17752.53s -> 17763.62s]  Good. Capture.
[17763.62s -> 17772.88s]  No, stop going to the wall, man.
[17772.88s -> 17774.88s]  He wants to destroy the wall so bad.
[17776.37s -> 17777.65s]  We're so close to winning.
[17778.29s -> 17792.42s]  Who's left? I don't see anybody.
[17793.46s -> 17794.98s]  Just get everybody on here and take it over.
[17795.70s -> 17801.49s]  Handing out some pocket signs.
[17801.49s -> 17802.77s]  Rats, stand up for the wrong.
[17802.77s -> 17804.45s]  German chat has proved unfair.
[17804.45s -> 17806.13s]  Now we infiltrate his lairs.
[17807.17s -> 17809.52s]  I think I win.
[17810.24s -> 17818.00s]  They're taking this, but that's not going to be enough.
[17818.00s -> 17819.20s]  I got their capital right here.
[17819.76s -> 17822.96s]  All right, Mirrius, go ahead and take the walls down if you really want to.
[17837.90s -> 17838.78s]  Maybe he should just go.
[17839.42s -> 17842.83s]  No, because he's going to wake up.
[17842.83s -> 17845.54s]  And I have to get back on top of him and punch his face until he's dead again.
[17846.50s -> 17848.61s]  Let's give morale.
[17849.33s -> 17860.83s]  Who's clipping their nails in the background?
[17861.87s -> 17862.99s]  Does kind of sound like that, right?
[17862.99s -> 17863.55s]  Raise morale.
[17865.01s -> 17865.81s]  Take this shit over.
[17866.53s -> 17873.31s]  I'm a little out of breath.
[17875.44s -> 17876.82s]  Here he comes.
[17877.46s -> 17880.83s]  All right, when he respawns, just do it again instantly.
[17881.55s -> 17882.03s]  Here he is.
[17889.09s -> 17895.90s]  No, you're getting stuck on a building.
[17895.90s -> 17896.86s]  You fucking idiot.
[17898.53s -> 17899.97s]  He's getting stuck on a building.
[17903.49s -> 17903.99s]  Get him.
[17905.30s -> 17906.74s]  Yep, got him.
[17906.74s -> 17908.10s]  Yep, yep, yep.
[17908.98s -> 17915.84s]  All right, he got a couple of shots and that's okay.
[17916.88s -> 17917.52s]  More than one.
[17917.52s -> 17918.88s]  All right, you're good.
[17918.88s -> 17923.12s]  Just, Mirrius, Mirrius, Mirrius, Mirrius.
[17924.08s -> 17926.72s]  Get on top of him.
[17926.72s -> 17928.48s]  Get on top of him and beat his fucking head in.
[17929.04s -> 17929.68s]  Get on top of him.
[17930.80s -> 17940.86s]  Elbow drop.
[17955.81s -> 17956.21s]  I win.
[17956.93s -> 17962.83s]  I thought he was going to elbow drop him.
[17964.27s -> 17964.67s]  Eat him.
[17965.31s -> 17966.16s]  That's fine.
[17979.87s -> 17981.79s]  Being a new viewer is a weird experience.
[17982.59s -> 17991.97s]  I was just like spam for like 30 minutes.
[17992.93s -> 18000.37s]  All right, my lights are on.
[18000.37s -> 18001.17s]  We already went over this.
[18002.05s -> 18003.17s]  My lights are turned on.
[18004.85s -> 18007.33s]  My exposure is lower because I start streaming during the day.
[18008.37s -> 18025.98s]  Eat this.
[18025.98s -> 18026.70s]  Kick it.
[18026.70s -> 18035.97s]  I'm going to use my two minutes on an omega low.
[18035.97s -> 18037.25s]  Now that's a good use.
[18037.25s -> 18038.21s]  That's a good use.
[18038.21s -> 18039.65s]  Pick this person up and just throw him.
[18078.42s -> 18079.14s]  Aztecs.
[18079.86s -> 18083.87s]  I wonder if the old prophecy is true.
[18083.87s -> 18087.87s]  If the Greeks are the weak race brought to strength by a god.
[18089.87s -> 18094.75s]  If so, will they fulfill the next chapter and go to Honshai
[18094.75s -> 18098.27s]  where their separated Greek brethren wait for them?
[18098.27s -> 18100.35s]  Did Mirrius get buff?
[18100.35s -> 18100.85s]  No.
[18100.85s -> 18101.55s]  We've done it.
[18101.55s -> 18102.19s]  Victory.
[18102.19s -> 18102.91s]  He got fat.
[18102.91s -> 18104.43s]  Your evilness knows no bounds.
[18104.43s -> 18105.15s]  He died.
[18105.15s -> 18109.07s]  Well, he got incapacitated twice and apparently had a bunch of food in his stomach.
[18110.03s -> 18118.21s]  Do I just have him build a few houses?
[18118.77s -> 18119.57s]  But I got to get the free.
[18119.57s -> 18120.53s]  We got to go back to free will.
[18120.53s -> 18121.57s]  I'm going to lose free will here.
[18122.21s -> 18128.45s]  Look at how bad that looks.
[18128.45s -> 18129.49s]  It's like a zipper.
[18130.13s -> 18132.21s]  All right.
[18132.21s -> 18132.93s]  Hell yeah, I did it.
[18134.37s -> 18137.17s]  Are you sure you wish to leave the land?
[18137.17s -> 18138.69s]  Click again to confirm.
[18144.22s -> 18150.78s]  Leader, I've been hearing rumors that some more of our people survived the Aztec volcanoes.
[18151.42s -> 18155.82s]  Some elite archers managed to fight their way clear after we left.
[18155.82s -> 18157.18s]  We need to find them.
[18157.18s -> 18160.22s]  We need all the elite troops we can get.
[18160.22s -> 18162.62s]  We need everyone we can get.
[18162.62s -> 18166.06s]  Archers or not, they're on another land.
[18166.06s -> 18168.22s]  We must go and find them.
[18168.22s -> 18169.50s]  Yeah, archers.
[18169.50s -> 18170.46s]  What are we waiting for?
[18171.50s -> 18180.26s]  All right.
[18180.26s -> 18180.74s]  Twenty.
[18180.74s -> 18183.30s]  Yeah, that was a little bit of an evil level.
[18183.30s -> 18189.55s]  Preacher, 32% evil.
[18189.55s -> 18190.51s]  Age three.
[18191.15s -> 18193.76s]  He's now seven feet tall.
[18195.38s -> 18196.10s]  Fatness.
[18196.10s -> 18202.22s]  The lightest he was today was 592 pounds and now he's 2400 pounds.
[18202.22s -> 18205.34s]  That's like a car.
[18209.30s -> 18210.74s]  Fitness is actually not bad.
[18211.38s -> 18214.18s]  Hit points.
[18214.18s -> 18217.22s]  Final 45 because the number of bowel movements, 54.
[18217.78s -> 18218.98s]  167 kills.
[18221.62s -> 18223.14s]  Grain and villagers.
[18223.94s -> 18229.02s]  All right, we can do some miracles next time.
[18230.14s -> 18232.45s]  A little evil.
[18232.45s -> 18232.85s]  It's okay.
[18233.49s -> 18234.85s]  It's not full-blown evil.
[18236.38s -> 18239.50s]  Water field, water forest, build a wall, use creature rolls.
[18240.38s -> 18242.38s]  Undead legion, nut oil.
[18242.38s -> 18243.34s]  What is nut oil?
[18243.90s -> 18245.34s]  Undead legion and win the land.
[18245.34s -> 18246.22s]  What's undead legion?
[18248.22s -> 18250.83s]  Impressiveness was okay.
[18251.47s -> 18252.51s]  My vitals.
[18252.51s -> 18253.15s]  All right, we're good.
[18254.43s -> 18255.23s]  We saved the game.
[18255.23s -> 18256.11s]  Real Link, you got it.
[18284.67s -> 18285.23s]  No.
[18285.23s -> 18285.87s]  Opposite.
[18288.75s -> 18291.33s]  There's a lot of people right here.
[18292.29s -> 18302.08s]  Mega Man 2 is better than Black and White King.
[18302.08s -> 18303.76s]  There's some juicy towns to ransack.
[18303.76s -> 18305.04s]  I'm gonna like this place.
[18312.40s -> 18313.12s]  What?
[18313.12s -> 18313.68s]  Watch this.
[18313.68s -> 18315.20s]  You're wearing a cast.
[18315.20s -> 18315.92s]  No, no, no.
[18315.92s -> 18317.20s]  This is...
[18317.20s -> 18320.32s]  The rumors of the Greeks return are true.
[18320.32s -> 18323.68s]  My brother has sent me to make this island safe.
[18323.68s -> 18324.80s]  This I will do.
[18326.08s -> 18329.46s]  Oh, sounds like a tribal commander, boys.
[18329.86s -> 18332.10s]  We'd better start building now.
[18332.10s -> 18335.86s]  These Japanese seem to be formidable builders themselves.
[18335.86s -> 18337.86s]  And get some armies, boys.
[18337.86s -> 18340.50s]  They look pretty handy at fighting as well.
[18341.78s -> 18345.79s]  That's a pretty sick Nerf combat vest.
[18347.31s -> 18349.79s]  That's probably the best boy I've seen described.
[18349.79s -> 18351.15s]  50 warriors.
[18351.15s -> 18353.55s]  Now that's nice, boys, real nice.
[18354.91s -> 18355.39s]  What?
[18355.39s -> 18355.89s]  What is it?
[18355.89s -> 18358.35s]  I'm going to play with that toy.
[18358.35s -> 18359.55s]  This will be full of them.
[18360.43s -> 18362.59s]  What do you think about the toy?
[18363.31s -> 18365.95s]  So, you like your armies, do you?
[18365.95s -> 18367.87s]  Bow to the might of my armies.
[18369.31s -> 18371.76s]  It's got a lot of armies.
[18373.76s -> 18374.72s]  You love me.
[18378.35s -> 18382.27s]  Leader, you must start building a wall inside your influence.
[18382.27s -> 18383.31s]  I have to build a wall?
[18383.31s -> 18387.23s]  You finish outside it, but not in an enemy's influence.
[18387.23s -> 18388.43s]  I don't even have a creature den.
[18388.43s -> 18392.75s]  All right, we gotta start with the most important part.
[18392.75s -> 18395.71s]  And these guys will eat twice the normal rate.
[18395.71s -> 18400.91s]  So, keep an eye out on your stores by forcing from the tribute menu.
[18402.27s -> 18402.77s]  Okay.
[18404.27s -> 18406.96s]  All right, let me do the test.
[18409.44s -> 18409.94s]  Hey!
[18412.94s -> 18413.44s]  Hey!
[18417.55s -> 18418.51s]  Oh, I can't.
[18418.51s -> 18420.11s]  I need to unlock forcing.
[18420.75s -> 18424.54s]  Get some sleep by the trees.
[18424.54s -> 18426.14s]  Yeah, I gotta build some shit first.
[18426.14s -> 18426.64s]  Let's build...
[18427.50s -> 18429.02s]  Let's get a storeroom back here.
[18429.58s -> 18430.64s]  Let's put it...
[18431.78s -> 18433.30s]  There's a bunch of trees over here.
[18433.30s -> 18434.26s]  Let's put it right here.
[18435.49s -> 18438.05s]  They're planning to store for the future.
[18438.05s -> 18440.77s]  This conflict will not have a speedy resolution.
[18441.57s -> 18444.38s]  Clear this out.
[18445.90s -> 18446.86s]  He just threw somebody.
[18452.38s -> 18457.10s]  Nation needs resources, and this storehouse will be full of them.
[18457.10s -> 18459.98s]  You're a little late, Murius, but you used a good try.
[18459.98s -> 18465.10s]  They will store enough to keep the form of this conflict alive for years to come.
[18466.06s -> 18468.86s]  Okay, let's get tons of...
[18468.86s -> 18469.42s]  Huge.
[18469.42s -> 18471.58s]  I mean, like, just a stupid amount.
[18471.58s -> 18475.50s]  Their land will soon yield them all they require.
[18476.70s -> 18477.76s]  Oops.
[18479.90s -> 18482.14s]  Okay, now let's get a...
[18483.42s -> 18484.78s]  71 people can work on there.
[18485.90s -> 18486.78s]  I taught him that.
[18486.78s -> 18487.42s]  I didn't mean to.
[18489.38s -> 18491.38s]  Let's drop this in here because it's ore.
[18491.38s -> 18492.10s]  Just re-ore.
[18496.00s -> 18496.88s]  Go play with your toy.
[18497.86s -> 18498.26s]  Stop.
[18498.26s -> 18498.74s]  Don't...
[18498.74s -> 18500.02s]  Stop doing, like, the...
[18500.02s -> 18501.30s]  Just stepping on people.
[18501.30s -> 18501.80s]  Stop!
[18502.18s -> 18503.30s]  He's doing it on purpose!
[18503.30s -> 18503.80s]  Get up!
[18504.58s -> 18515.88s]  What's up?
[18516.26s -> 18517.46s]  You can play with the toys, yes.
[18518.18s -> 18521.33s]  You can play with your toys, but just please move out of the way.
[18521.33s -> 18522.53s]  So I can pick up this boulder.
[18527.63s -> 18528.13s]  There we go.
[18531.98s -> 18533.10s]  So now we got...
[18533.10s -> 18534.86s]  Let's put some people in the woods.
[18535.98s -> 18537.82s]  People just doing their thing.
[18538.70s -> 18541.26s]  Let's get, like, 10, 20 people on the farm.
[18541.26s -> 18541.82s]  Disciple farmer.
[18541.82s -> 18548.46s]  Disciple farmer.
[18548.46s -> 18549.66s]  Disciple farmer.
[18550.54s -> 18551.50s]  10 people in the woods?
[18552.90s -> 18554.10s]  Disciple farmer.
[18555.94s -> 18556.66s]  How many are here now?
[18556.66s -> 18557.86s]  Disciple farmer.
[18561.54s -> 18562.26s]  Work isn't filled.
[18562.26s -> 18562.98s]  5, 10.
[18562.98s -> 18563.94s]  Let's do, like, another 5.
[18564.90s -> 18566.10s]  Disciple farmer.
[18567.84s -> 18568.34s]  Hey.
[18568.96s -> 18571.89s]  We need to build some roads and some houses.
[18571.89s -> 18573.09s]  We're gonna do the houses back here.
[18573.65s -> 18577.25s]  Let me get your toys out of the way.
[18577.25s -> 18579.92s]  There's gonna be a street this way.
[18580.88s -> 18582.16s]  There's gonna be a street this way.
[18582.80s -> 18588.10s]  Two streets.
[18588.74s -> 18591.07s]  Two streets that meet into the main road here.
[18591.07s -> 18591.57s]  Sure.
[18595.73s -> 18596.13s]  Oh, here?
[18596.13s -> 18596.63s]  What?
[18596.85s -> 18598.64s]  What the hell was that?
[18604.61s -> 18605.01s]  Why is it...
[18605.01s -> 18606.21s]  Oh, he threw that over here.
[18606.85s -> 18607.41s]  Thank you, Mary.
[18607.41s -> 18607.91s]  I appreciate it.
[18612.38s -> 18617.30s]  Okay, now I got a big farm.
[18618.02s -> 18619.98s]  I need to build some houses.
[18620.62s -> 18621.82s]  Actually, how much tribute do I have?
[18628.62s -> 18629.82s]  All right, I want...
[18633.47s -> 18634.19s]  Don't I...
[18634.19s -> 18634.83s]  I already did that.
[18635.55s -> 18640.43s]  What do I want to research?
[18641.23s -> 18647.36s]  Okay, armory.
[18647.36s -> 18648.48s]  Our advanced soldier.
[18649.12s -> 18650.08s]  One man, one ball.
[18650.08s -> 18650.64s]  Voodoo doll.
[18650.64s -> 18651.14s]  Lamp.
[18651.92s -> 18652.42s]  Meadow?
[18652.96s -> 18654.34s]  What does a meadow do?
[18655.30s -> 18657.06s]  Animals can graze and flourish here.
[18657.06s -> 18658.74s]  It's an enhancement to the town.
[18660.70s -> 18661.20s]  Well?
[18661.82s -> 18665.70s]  Positive effects on the...
[18666.66s -> 18668.50s]  The town ham...
[18668.50s -> 18670.10s]  All right, I got to do the force pickup, right?
[18671.36s -> 18672.56s]  And forcing.
[18672.56s -> 18673.12s]  20,000.
[18673.12s -> 18673.60s]  What do I have?
[18673.60s -> 18674.00s]  150.
[18674.00s -> 18674.48s]  Yeah, I do it.
[18675.20s -> 18676.24s]  All right, I can now do that.
[18677.20s -> 18678.00s]  Plant market.
[18678.72s -> 18681.79s]  Okay, let's do...
[18681.79s -> 18682.83s]  Let's get a plant market.
[18685.22s -> 18685.72s]  House.
[18686.34s -> 18693.23s]  Maybe a...
[18693.23s -> 18694.11s]  I don't want to hovel.
[18696.27s -> 18696.77s]  Tavern?
[18698.26s -> 18699.94s]  People need somewhere to relax and unwind.
[18700.74s -> 18701.54s]  Tavern?
[18702.48s -> 18703.12s]  A prison.
[18703.76s -> 18706.22s]  Draggs have sighted the corrupting criminal
[18706.22s -> 18707.34s]  that kept away from the populace
[18707.34s -> 18708.94s]  within these diank walls.
[18709.82s -> 18713.39s]  Maybe a nursery.
[18713.39s -> 18714.19s]  I need this so bad.
[18714.91s -> 18717.68s]  All right, let's settle down here.
[18719.89s -> 18720.93s]  Yeah, settle down, settle down.
[18720.93s -> 18722.21s]  Now I got a lot of opportunity.
[18722.21s -> 18723.57s]  We got a real link.
[18723.57s -> 18724.07s]  Cool.
[18724.61s -> 18729.00s]  Save it here.
[18729.54s -> 18736.54s]  All right, have we settled down?
[18736.54s -> 18738.14s]  Have we settled down, everybody?
[18738.14s -> 18741.57s]  Did you get it out of your system?
[18741.57s -> 18744.21s]  Did you like scream into the bag long enough?
[18744.21s -> 18748.61s]  Are we functioning again?
[18748.61s -> 18754.40s]  Get this.
[18755.18s -> 18758.83s]  Oh, I need a creature den.
[18759.39s -> 18763.06s]  Oh, look.
[18763.06s -> 18763.78s]  A town right here.
[18764.98s -> 18766.02s]  Let's influence this town.
[18766.02s -> 18767.54s]  I'm not going to destroy this one.
[18767.54s -> 18778.38s]  Magical shrine of some sort?
[18779.02s -> 18783.60s]  I'm just a creature.
[18784.86s -> 18785.36s]  You're okay.
[18795.44s -> 18796.32s]  Influencer.
[18796.32s -> 18797.68s]  E-clown influencer.
[18797.68s -> 18798.80s]  No, not really.
[18800.08s -> 18801.20s]  Considering I've said,
[18801.20s -> 18802.32s]  can you guys settle down?
[18803.04s -> 18804.24s]  Settle down, please.
[18805.46s -> 18807.46s]  I'm the fucking substitute teacher in the class
[18807.46s -> 18808.90s]  of all like the bad kids.
[18808.90s -> 18809.46s]  You know what I mean?
[18809.46s -> 18813.06s]  Like, guys, can we just like tone it down a little?
[18813.06s -> 18815.06s]  And they're like, shut the fuck up, loser.
[18815.94s -> 18818.90s]  Okay, can, okay.
[18818.98s -> 18821.78s]  Said everybody, I'm Mr. Elbertson,
[18821.78s -> 18823.14s]  and I'm here to teach you math.
[18823.70s -> 18828.54s]  I'm not going to teach that math.
[18828.54s -> 18830.85s]  I'm not going to teach that class math.
[18830.85s -> 18832.37s]  They're going to fucking be mean to you.
[18833.46s -> 18834.58s]  You're going to try to connect.
[18837.52s -> 18838.16s]  Hey, teach.
[18838.16s -> 18839.92s]  Shut the fuck up and play the game.
[18841.76s -> 18842.32s]  Hey, teach.
[18843.04s -> 18843.84s]  You're a loser.
[18844.91s -> 18845.47s]  You suck.
[18846.19s -> 18850.58s]  I ain't doing shit today.
[18850.58s -> 18851.30s]  Nobody does that.
[18851.94s -> 18861.49s]  Hey, that doesn't happen in classrooms.
[18861.49s -> 18863.81s]  I haven't been in a classroom in 25 years.
[18864.45s -> 18866.05s]  I have no idea what kids do these days.
[18866.53s -> 18877.18s]  He always hit that lady.
[18877.18s -> 18877.50s]  All right.
[18877.50s -> 18877.90s]  Keep going.
[18877.90s -> 18878.22s]  Keep going.
[18878.22s -> 18878.54s]  Keep going.
[18878.54s -> 18879.34s]  No more distractions.
[18879.34s -> 18880.38s]  No more distractions.
[18880.38s -> 18881.58s]  Wait, he did hit that lady.
[18882.14s -> 18884.70s]  He's playing peek-a-boo?
[18884.70s -> 18885.58s]  Why is he scared?
[18886.62s -> 18892.06s]  I'm going to play with that toy.
[18892.06s -> 18892.30s]  Good.
[18892.86s -> 18893.10s]  All right.
[18893.10s -> 18895.52s]  Let's focus, focus, focus, focus.
[18895.52s -> 18896.96s]  I need A.
[18897.84s -> 18905.17s]  Let's do a nursery for the new kids.
[18905.17s -> 18907.39s]  I'm going to go right over here.
[18907.39s -> 18908.11s]  That's fine.
[18908.11s -> 18911.47s]  Children are the future and need to be looked after.
[18912.11s -> 18914.27s]  So there are city builders.
[18914.27s -> 18915.55s]  They're not much my size.
[18915.55s -> 18916.59s]  Absolutely.
[18916.59s -> 18917.95s]  Please pull on the toy.
[18920.11s -> 18920.35s]  Yes.
[18920.91s -> 18921.15s]  Right.
[18922.03s -> 18922.67s]  Absolutely.
[18945.01s -> 18947.01s]  It was a false alarm.
[18950.00s -> 18951.44s]  I've been in that position before.
[18955.15s -> 18956.27s]  No, he didn't.
[18956.27s -> 18957.15s]  No, it's this.
[18957.15s -> 18958.67s]  I don't like to take spells.
[18959.55s -> 18961.17s]  Well, maybe you shouldn't shit on it.
[18963.04s -> 18963.36s]  Okay.
[18963.36s -> 18964.16s]  I need wood.
[18967.90s -> 18968.38s]  Yes.
[18968.38s -> 18969.90s]  Please help me construct the wood.
[18971.02s -> 18971.76s]  All right.
[18971.76s -> 18972.00s]  Yes.
[18972.00s -> 18972.48s]  Get out of the way.
[18972.48s -> 18974.40s]  You picked up like three twigs, dude.
[18975.20s -> 18983.55s]  Wait, what happened?
[18983.55s -> 18984.59s]  Did I get killed?
[18985.31s -> 18991.97s]  We good?
[18991.97s -> 18993.28s]  Are we good?
[18994.16s -> 18996.72s]  What happened?
[18998.08s -> 19004.62s]  All right.
[19004.62s -> 19005.58s]  Let's get some houses built.
[19007.14s -> 19008.50s]  We need some real houses.
[19008.50s -> 19012.10s]  Future generations of Greeks arrive in this land.
[19012.10s -> 19013.38s]  House, house, house, house.
[19013.38s -> 19014.34s]  Just a regular house.
[19014.34s -> 19015.22s]  Here we go.
[19015.22s -> 19015.46s]  Boom.
[19016.18s -> 19018.70s]  Are we good?
[19019.34s -> 19022.14s]  All right.
[19022.14s -> 19025.98s]  I want to do houses like this on either side.
[19027.62s -> 19027.94s]  Like that.
[19028.58s -> 19031.62s]  The Greeks wish to house their people.
[19031.62s -> 19033.22s]  This shows foresight.
[19034.82s -> 19037.34s]  We can now house our people.
[19038.06s -> 19038.62s]  Excellent.
[19039.50s -> 19041.57s]  Okay.
[19041.57s -> 19042.45s]  Same thing on the other side.
[19043.41s -> 19045.09s]  Jeremy, never leave us again.
[19045.09s -> 19045.41s]  I'm sorry.
[19045.41s -> 19045.73s]  I didn't.
[19045.73s -> 19046.37s]  I don't know what happened.
[19047.17s -> 19057.06s]  He's helping.
[19073.04s -> 19074.80s]  We're going to have a lot of kids.
[19075.52s -> 19085.76s]  One more.
[19085.76s -> 19086.08s]  All right.
[19086.08s -> 19087.20s]  We got a lot of houses here.
[19087.92s -> 19092.34s]  We need wood and lots of it.
[19092.34s -> 19092.74s]  Who's not?
[19092.74s -> 19093.30s]  Is anybody?
[19093.30s -> 19094.58s]  We need some foresters.
[19095.06s -> 19096.26s]  They're all foresters.
[19099.79s -> 19100.03s]  Shit.
[19100.03s -> 19101.47s]  Run out of wood here.
[19103.73s -> 19105.49s]  Let them settle in their houses.
[19106.13s -> 19106.77s]  Soon.
[19106.77s -> 19107.09s]  Wink.
[19107.09s -> 19122.34s]  I'm changing Wink to just like angry.
[19122.34s -> 19123.22s]  It's demonic.
[19131.50s -> 19133.60s]  Who was that?
[19133.60s -> 19134.80s]  Was that even you, dude?
[19145.33s -> 19146.29s]  We're going to run out of trees.
[19156.61s -> 19158.77s]  Greek holds seem uneasy for.
[19160.45s -> 19161.25s]  Stop hurting people.
[19161.25s -> 19161.89s]  You're hurting people.
[19161.89s -> 19162.39s]  Stop.
[19166.74s -> 19167.94s]  What if I just don't build any?
[19169.22s -> 19172.10s]  If I don't build any like war machines or factories,
[19172.10s -> 19173.38s]  won't that mean I'm not a threat?
[19174.26s -> 19176.10s]  We can be friends and stuff, right?
[19176.82s -> 19184.78s]  But it doesn't have to be violence like last time.
[19185.90s -> 19186.38s]  What if we?
[19187.42s -> 19189.42s]  We have homes for our warriors.
[19189.42s -> 19192.30s]  Although they choose to be on the battlefield.
[19194.14s -> 19195.50s]  Still need to build that wall.
[19197.10s -> 19199.90s]  I got a lot of houses.
[19199.90s -> 19200.78s]  Time to make some breeding.
[19201.90s -> 19206.77s]  Not being very helpful right now.
[19207.33s -> 19214.02s]  I estimated them.
[19214.10s -> 19215.78s]  Their tongue grows quickly.
[19218.61s -> 19219.81s]  Yeah, I got to start doing.
[19219.81s -> 19220.85s]  People have to start breeding.
[19234.69s -> 19236.05s]  How far into webcam?
[19236.85s -> 19240.82s]  I mean, it's going to start.
[19240.82s -> 19242.98s]  You're just going to start to make me fucking laugh out loud.
[19252.29s -> 19253.09s]  Water miracle.
[19254.21s -> 19255.89s]  Okay, let's do water miracle.
[19255.89s -> 19256.29s]  I can't.
[19256.29s -> 19257.33s]  I need to have a little worship.
[19259.09s -> 19260.29s]  You hate me.
[19260.29s -> 19261.41s]  You hate me.
[19261.41s -> 19262.29s]  You hate me.
[19262.85s -> 19264.13s]  That was depressing.
[19271.70s -> 19272.20s]  Look, see?
[19279.15s -> 19279.95s]  Breathe.
[19279.95s -> 19280.45s]  Let's go.
[19281.31s -> 19281.81s]  Breeding.
[19286.64s -> 19289.20s]  Start that population.
[19295.87s -> 19299.84s]  Breed, breed, breed, breed, breed.
[19300.80s -> 19301.30s]  Breeding.
[19303.76s -> 19304.26s]  More.
[19305.20s -> 19305.92s]  We need plenty.
[19305.92s -> 19307.20s]  We need people to live in these houses.
[19308.08s -> 19311.28s]  All right, that looks good for now.
[19314.37s -> 19314.87s]  Dancing?
[19317.12s -> 19321.33s]  All right, they all dropped it.
[19323.10s -> 19338.14s]  Okay, looking good.
[19338.14s -> 19338.86s]  We got a lot.
[19338.86s -> 19339.58s]  Let's do the.
[19339.58s -> 19341.58s]  Let's get some worshipers here.
[19342.46s -> 19345.14s]  At least this is how it merits is happy.
[19345.14s -> 19346.02s]  That's good.
[19346.02s -> 19347.06s]  All right, what else do I want?
[19347.86s -> 19349.30s]  I don't want to make an armory right now.
[19350.26s -> 19353.68s]  I need to make a temple.
[19354.24s -> 19362.48s]  I'm just going to go back here behind the altar.
[19363.12s -> 19363.62s]  Yep.
[19364.24s -> 19364.74s]  Yep.
[19367.58s -> 19369.98s]  Praise all the gods you wish, Greeks.
[19370.86s -> 19372.54s]  They will not aid you now.
[19373.34s -> 19379.15s]  Are we going to get a cringy mode?
[19381.33s -> 19381.83s]  Never.
[19382.45s -> 19383.25s]  That's never going to happen.
[19384.53s -> 19392.16s]  We need to influence over here.
[19393.09s -> 19394.37s]  Actually, I can do this now, right?
[19394.37s -> 19394.87s]  Yeah.
[19394.87s -> 19395.81s]  Let's do this little side quest.
[19396.37s -> 19410.46s]  Student one, it has time for your test.
[19412.86s -> 19421.06s]  Destroy the blocks using your chi.
[19421.06s -> 19421.62s]  I don't want to do that.
[19421.62s -> 19422.66s]  Focus, boy.
[19424.82s -> 19429.58s]  What do I have to do?
[19429.58s -> 19445.65s]  It's got to hurt.
[19445.65s -> 19446.53s]  Poor fellow.
[19446.53s -> 19449.65s]  Perhaps you could help by destroying the blocks for him, leader.
[19449.65s -> 19450.05s]  I could do that.
[19450.05s -> 19452.61s]  Usually, I wouldn't agree with being a thief.
[19452.61s -> 19456.61s]  But when it comes to destruction, I just can't say no.
[19459.36s -> 19459.86s]  All right.
[19460.66s -> 19462.12s]  I'll destroy it.
[19468.53s -> 19469.57s]  What do you want me to do?
[19469.57s -> 19470.29s]  Like, grab it?
[19471.09s -> 19477.46s]  You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[19478.18s -> 19480.98s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[19481.62s -> 19483.70s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[19484.98s -> 19485.48s]  Bash it?
[19486.34s -> 19487.62s]  How do I bash it?
[19496.02s -> 19497.43s]  I can't, like, move around?
[19497.43s -> 19497.93s]  No, no, no.
[19498.55s -> 19500.63s]  Focus your chi, student.
[19502.34s -> 19507.84s]  Uh, forcing brings your hand to the physics room.
[19507.84s -> 19508.48s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19508.48s -> 19511.52s]  Press and hold the action button in a clear area to engage forcing.
[19511.52s -> 19514.40s]  Gently, gentle movement will nudge things.
[19515.52s -> 19516.02s]  Wait.
[19516.48s -> 19532.58s]  Hold.
[19533.12s -> 19534.40s]  Okay, I'm holding the button down.
[19536.45s -> 19536.95s]  Nudge.
[19540.12s -> 19543.22s]  Is this what I'm supposed to be doing?
[19544.26s -> 19546.23s]  And then hit it when he...
[19547.27s -> 19550.52s]  Okay, well, let's try it again.
[19551.96s -> 19559.75s]  Okay, here we go.
[19569.43s -> 19573.75s]  You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[19574.23s -> 19577.03s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[19577.59s -> 19580.55s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[19580.55s -> 19589.83s]  Okay, he did that on his own.
[19589.83s -> 19590.33s]  I didn't do that.
[19598.08s -> 19598.88s]  He actually just did that.
[19598.88s -> 19599.84s]  I didn't do anything.
[19599.84s -> 19603.46s]  Excellent.
[19604.08s -> 19621.72s]  You must work harder, student.
[19622.52s -> 19623.32s]  I don't understand.
[19627.22s -> 19628.10s]  I don't, I don't get it.
[19628.74s -> 19632.39s]  Like, I hold the button down and then I'm trying to, like, nudge it.
[19633.92s -> 19635.04s]  The quantum moon.
[19636.00s -> 19637.65s]  Yeah, leave it.
[19637.65s -> 19638.93s]  I was trying to stay on the rock.
[19639.89s -> 19641.49s]  Let's try it one more time.
[19641.49s -> 19643.01s]  I don't really...
[19643.01s -> 19644.76s]  I was doing it right.
[19645.48s -> 19651.72s]  Okay, I'm just holding the button down here.
[19655.78s -> 19665.03s]  You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[19665.75s -> 19668.63s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[19669.27s -> 19670.63s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[19670.63s -> 19671.43s]  Just hold it down.
[19672.71s -> 19673.75s]  I'm just holding it down.
[19679.60s -> 19683.49s]  I'm getting lucky three times in a row.
[19683.49s -> 19684.21s]  There's got to be some...
[19684.77s -> 19687.01s]  There was a weird ring that came up from the bottom of it.
[19687.01s -> 19688.13s]  Focus your chi, student.
[19688.13s -> 19688.85s]  Just wiggle it.
[19688.85s -> 19699.60s]  Press and hold the action button in a clear area to engage forcing.
[19699.60s -> 19701.28s]  Gentle movement will nudge thing.
[19702.32s -> 19728.56s]  Good work.
[19729.28s -> 19739.99s]  Um, why is it not working now?
[19744.66s -> 19746.90s]  You must work harder, student.
[19751.52s -> 19752.00s]  Gentle?
[19752.00s -> 19753.04s]  How is this not gentle?
[19753.76s -> 19756.56s]  Like, how is this not gentle?
[19757.44s -> 19763.88s]  Stay away from the rock, then move the hand close.
[19793.54s -> 19794.58s]  You were following me.
[19794.58s -> 19798.34s]  You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[19798.98s -> 19802.42s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[19802.42s -> 19804.50s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[19818.13s -> 19819.52s]  No, no, no.
[19819.52s -> 19821.44s]  Focus your chi, student.
[19821.44s -> 19822.64s]  Pull up the YouTube video.
[19835.97s -> 19837.81s]  Try stroking the rock while holding...
[19839.17s -> 19843.01s]  All right, I'm going to do this one more time before I have to go back and build buildings.
[19843.01s -> 19843.89s]  It's been like three days.
[19851.99s -> 19853.59s]  I'm not affecting anything right now.
[19854.47s -> 19857.43s]  Like, I have a fist right now and I'm not touching anything.
[19858.47s -> 19862.79s]  You need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[19862.79s -> 19863.35s]  What is happening?
[19863.35s -> 19866.07s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[19866.63s -> 19868.71s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[19879.24s -> 19880.76s]  I have no idea what's happening.
[19895.48s -> 19897.64s]  You must work harder, student.
[19900.15s -> 19904.55s]  You may build cities, but nothing you can erect can match my cities.
[19905.59s -> 19909.64s]  Keep praying to your false gods.
[19911.64s -> 19913.40s]  Wait for him to strike and then do that.
[19915.01s -> 19918.53s]  A nursery to nurture the honorable warriors of tomorrow.
[19919.97s -> 19920.77s]  All right, it doesn't matter.
[19920.77s -> 19922.85s]  A magnificent temple.
[19922.85s -> 19923.81s]  Like my temple?
[19923.81s -> 19925.97s]  Respect from all outsiders.
[19926.93s -> 19928.93s]  Okay, I got some respect.
[19931.17s -> 19933.17s]  Let's do some worship.
[19933.57s -> 19934.77s]  Worship her.
[19934.77s -> 19935.27s]  Let's...
[19936.21s -> 19937.01s]  You, what are you up to?
[19938.13s -> 19938.69s]  Come over here.
[19939.65s -> 19942.05s]  Let's get you in the temple.
[19943.01s -> 19948.42s]  Okay, we got plenty of...
[19949.14s -> 19951.22s]  How's the nursery doing?
[19951.22s -> 19951.72s]  Good.
[19952.18s -> 19953.52s]  Plenty of room.
[19953.52s -> 19954.16s]  What do we need?
[19954.16s -> 19954.88s]  What do people need?
[19956.02s -> 19959.97s]  Food, desire, and homes are okay.
[19960.77s -> 19963.22s]  We need more food.
[19964.69s -> 19965.33s]  Water miracle.
[19965.33s -> 19967.01s]  Let's get this water like this.
[19967.01s -> 19967.81s]  Check this shit out.
[19967.81s -> 19968.31s]  Ready?
[19969.09s -> 19970.86s]  Are you sick?
[19971.48s -> 19974.28s]  There's more people on the farm.
[19977.24s -> 19978.44s]  Disciple farmer.
[19981.99s -> 19985.75s]  All right, all he's doing is throwing the bear back and forth.
[19987.67s -> 19988.55s]  What the hell is he doing?
[19990.98s -> 19991.94s]  Disband the army?
[19994.96s -> 19995.84s]  Can I?
[19995.84s -> 19996.34s]  I don't have a...
[19998.93s -> 20000.93s]  I think I need one of those war factories.
[20001.57s -> 20002.13s]  We'll do it.
[20002.69s -> 20006.96s]  Do some more watering.
[20007.84s -> 20012.84s]  More people in...
[20013.72s -> 20014.68s]  Oh, he's got a tree.
[20015.48s -> 20016.50s]  He's gotten big.
[20017.46s -> 20019.68s]  Disciple farmer.
[20024.44s -> 20025.48s]  Are these people foresting?
[20026.63s -> 20027.51s]  We almost have enough of them.
[20027.51s -> 20028.55s]  We're gonna take like two towns.
[20032.07s -> 20033.83s]  They're all going to bed?
[20036.32s -> 20038.64s]  We need a fucking road to go from here.
[20038.64s -> 20039.36s]  All right, what am I doing?
[20039.36s -> 20039.92s]  I need roads.
[20040.56s -> 20041.97s]  We get roads that come...
[20041.97s -> 20042.61s]  Okay, here we go.
[20043.33s -> 20047.64s]  Yeah, they might need roads.
[20048.28s -> 20053.01s]  I think they can actually walk.
[20056.42s -> 20057.70s]  We're going to gather that ore.
[20058.42s -> 20059.94s]  What is this?
[20060.74s -> 20064.96s]  Hey, will you fucking relax?
[20064.96s -> 20065.68s]  What is he doing?
[20070.20s -> 20071.08s]  Was the creature done?
[20071.72s -> 20076.56s]  Creature, creature, creature, creature pen.
[20076.56s -> 20077.52s]  There it is.
[20077.52s -> 20078.64s]  Let's put this one...
[20079.28s -> 20079.92s]  Let's put it up here.
[20080.64s -> 20083.96s]  Right on the edge.
[20085.49s -> 20088.29s]  They build a home for their creature.
[20088.29s -> 20089.97s]  I have never seen such a thing.
[20090.77s -> 20092.40s]  You don't have a creature?
[20093.28s -> 20094.00s]  How?
[20094.00s -> 20096.24s]  How is that possible?
[20105.36s -> 20107.60s]  Greeks have a formidable city.
[20107.60s -> 20109.52s]  My people must work harder.
[20111.32s -> 20112.04s]  Nah, I don't want to fight.
[20112.04s -> 20113.24s]  You've taken over the town.
[20113.24s -> 20113.64s]  We have?
[20113.64s -> 20118.04s]  Why would my people forfeit their honor and join the enemy?
[20118.04s -> 20119.16s]  How many people?
[20119.16s -> 20122.04s]  These people join us and take up our culture.
[20123.00s -> 20125.48s]  We will benefit from their strength.
[20125.48s -> 20126.52s]  It's five people.
[20127.16s -> 20129.00s]  There's five people there, man.
[20129.00s -> 20130.12s]  It's five people.
[20134.74s -> 20135.14s]  Thanks.
[20135.94s -> 20137.44s]  That's cool, I guess.
[20137.44s -> 20138.24s]  Thank you.
[20138.24s -> 20138.56s]  Welcome.
[20141.67s -> 20142.23s]  Good to see you.
[20143.03s -> 20143.67s]  Wait, hold on.
[20143.67s -> 20148.61s]  Their town is gone.
[20148.61s -> 20151.54s]  They're dismantling their entire town
[20152.92s -> 20155.59s]  and bringing five people over here.
[20156.15s -> 20158.20s]  I wanted to keep those buildings.
[20158.20s -> 20160.20s]  I would have kept those buildings.
[20164.68s -> 20165.24s]  Okay.
[20165.24s -> 20167.67s]  That's sure.
[20167.67s -> 20175.33s]  Whatever.
[20175.33s -> 20176.29s]  Come on in.
[20176.29s -> 20179.51s]  I see you taking the road.
[20180.23s -> 20182.63s]  Smart.
[20185.32s -> 20188.92s]  These Greeks are like any people I have met before.
[20189.80s -> 20193.19s]  Give me a flag.
[20197.11s -> 20202.40s]  Nah, I'm trying to accept you.
[20202.40s -> 20203.12s]  Give me the flag.
[20203.12s -> 20205.68s]  Our migration is waiting at our borders for you to accept.
[20205.68s -> 20206.16s]  Come on in.
[20207.52s -> 20208.32s]  Six people.
[20209.99s -> 20213.11s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[20213.11s -> 20213.67s]  Where are you going?
[20214.63s -> 20216.07s]  Come on in.
[20216.95s -> 20218.21s]  We've got plenty of room.
[20221.76s -> 20223.36s]  Now we build down here.
[20223.36s -> 20225.92s]  And then there's another place right here.
[20228.76s -> 20229.24s]  Look at this.
[20229.88s -> 20231.64s]  There's nine people in this town.
[20231.64s -> 20232.92s]  Let's influence this way.
[20232.92s -> 20234.52s]  We have a nursery.
[20234.52s -> 20237.99s]  The children grow and love us.
[20237.99s -> 20238.87s]  Great cities.
[20239.67s -> 20242.28s]  Where are you guys off to?
[20242.28s -> 20243.00s]  Let's get some water.
[20244.12s -> 20252.90s]  All right, Murius.
[20252.90s -> 20256.90s]  Can I give you a task or something?
[20257.78s -> 20259.30s]  He's just been whipping his...
[20259.30s -> 20260.50s]  Let's put you on gathering.
[20262.45s -> 20263.33s]  Here, gather.
[20264.79s -> 20265.67s]  Gather food.
[20270.24s -> 20271.84s]  You're so preoccupied with the toy.
[20281.91s -> 20282.47s]  All right.
[20282.47s -> 20285.60s]  Now, what do we need now?
[20285.60s -> 20286.16s]  Let's build...
[20286.80s -> 20287.92s]  What are we doing on population?
[20287.92s -> 20288.48s]  On houses?
[20289.28s -> 20293.52s]  Food.
[20294.08s -> 20295.12s]  Everything's doing fine.
[20296.55s -> 20297.83s]  No, why are people so unhappy?
[20298.39s -> 20299.99s]  Child population zero.
[20303.70s -> 20304.26s]  What?
[20304.26s -> 20305.06s]  What are you...
[20305.06s -> 20305.56s]  How?
[20306.34s -> 20309.89s]  I don't understand.
[20309.89s -> 20313.19s]  What's going on?
[20313.83s -> 20320.21s]  What are the kids?
[20330.56s -> 20331.36s]  Where are all the children?
[20332.64s -> 20334.88s]  A magnificent temple.
[20334.88s -> 20337.84s]  We'll learn respect from all outsiders.
[20339.68s -> 20340.72s]  They need beer.
[20344.00s -> 20344.32s]  Okay.
[20347.33s -> 20348.13s]  Tavern.
[20348.13s -> 20361.11s]  Let's put the tavern.
[20361.67s -> 20362.39s]  I want influence.
[20362.39s -> 20363.59s]  So let's put it down here.
[20364.15s -> 20365.25s]  Can I get it over here?
[20365.25s -> 20365.49s]  Come on.
[20365.49s -> 20366.69s]  There's a road right there too.
[20368.29s -> 20370.05s]  Murius, get your toys out of the way.
[20370.77s -> 20373.94s]  Right here.
[20373.94s -> 20381.56s]  What's this?
[20381.56s -> 20383.24s]  The population will be grateful.
[20383.24s -> 20385.00s]  Now you've built them a tavern.
[20385.00s -> 20386.12s]  I have to get rid of this shit.
[20386.12s -> 20387.24s]  Look at how annoying this is.
[20387.24s -> 20389.56s]  Allow our hardworking people to wax
[20389.56s -> 20392.20s]  and praise our culture through drink.
[20405.08s -> 20406.76s]  You'll need to work harder
[20406.76s -> 20409.08s]  to harness the awesome power of chi.
[20409.80s -> 20412.60s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[20413.24s -> 20415.72s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[20415.72s -> 20416.68s]  What, the smoke?
[20418.12s -> 20428.21s]  I mean, did the shit on the ring underneath it happen before?
[20429.01s -> 20429.89s]  No, no, no.
[20429.89s -> 20432.53s]  Hold the button and shake left and right until smoking.
[20437.06s -> 20438.42s]  Is this mission?
[20438.42s -> 20439.30s]  What is this thing?
[20441.03s -> 20443.19s]  Hold button down and shake left and right.
[20451.17s -> 20451.97s]  I saw the smoke.
[20456.45s -> 20461.25s]  You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[20461.25s -> 20464.05s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[20464.69s -> 20466.77s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[20467.97s -> 20483.78s]  Focus your chi, student.
[20484.66s -> 20486.82s]  I don't even know what this game is wanting me to do.
[20488.02s -> 20490.42s]  Like, oh, you can interact with the world,
[20490.42s -> 20492.50s]  but shake until there's smoke.
[20492.50s -> 20493.30s]  It doesn't say that.
[20503.32s -> 20504.60s]  Okay, I'm in it.
[20504.60s -> 20504.92s]  Touch.
[20508.12s -> 20509.00s]  Really shake it.
[20509.00s -> 20510.12s]  Really shake that thing.
[20511.00s -> 20513.46s]  Just do it at the same time.
[20526.88s -> 20528.16s]  Forwards and back.
[20528.16s -> 20532.16s]  You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[20532.88s -> 20535.68s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[20536.32s -> 20538.40s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[20538.40s -> 20539.76s]  Wrong at the same time.
[20541.28s -> 20544.23s]  Punch at the same time.
[20550.74s -> 20552.02s]  Just go up and down.
[20552.02s -> 20552.98s]  No, no, no.
[20552.98s -> 20554.02s]  In the name of god.
[20554.02s -> 20555.94s]  Focus your chi, student.
[20555.94s -> 20556.44s]  Tap?
[20558.58s -> 20559.08s]  Shake?
[20561.14s -> 20562.18s]  What the fuck?
[20562.18s -> 20563.92s]  No, put this down.
[20566.93s -> 20567.97s]  Read the other signs.
[20567.97s -> 20569.33s]  These other signs have nothing to do with this.
[20573.19s -> 20574.07s]  Dearly departed.
[20574.07s -> 20575.11s]  Dead people in the streets.
[20576.36s -> 20577.08s]  Empty towns.
[20577.08s -> 20583.12s]  Yeah, this has nothing to do with this.
[20583.12s -> 20585.12s]  Slide between all three rocks.
[20585.92s -> 20597.14s]  When I was sitting here going up and down like this,
[20597.14s -> 20599.94s]  there was a ring that was appearing underneath it.
[20599.94s -> 20604.34s]  You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[20604.74s -> 20607.54s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[20608.58s -> 20610.74s]  When I was doing this last time, it actually worked.
[20612.26s -> 20621.38s]  Good work.
[20621.38s -> 20635.76s]  I haven't changed anything.
[20637.12s -> 20639.28s]  You must work harder, student.
[20661.28s -> 20665.65s]  Do it in a circle.
[20666.29s -> 20670.29s]  You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[20671.09s -> 20674.45s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[20674.45s -> 20676.61s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[20679.09s -> 20679.59s]  What?
[20680.21s -> 20683.59s]  I- why is it working sometimes?
[20684.55s -> 20685.35s]  I saw the smoke.
[20690.13s -> 20690.77s]  No, no, no.
[20691.49s -> 20693.57s]  Focus your chi, student.
[20695.80s -> 20696.44s]  Up and down.
[20701.08s -> 20702.04s]  Shake harder.
[20702.76s -> 20715.60s]  Good work.
[20717.04s -> 20733.99s]  You must work harder, student.
[20734.79s -> 20740.90s]  Is there a YouTube video of somebody doing this?
[20740.90s -> 20744.07s]  This doesn't make any sense.
[20744.07s -> 20747.33s]  You basically can't stop shaking for a second or you fail.
[20748.13s -> 20764.93s]  You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[20765.73s -> 20768.53s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[20769.33s -> 20770.13s]  I'm not letting go.
[20770.13s -> 20771.09s]  The fist is closed.
[20771.09s -> 20771.89s]  What are you talking about?
[20772.53s -> 20775.41s]  Slightly larger- why would they make this like this?
[20776.69s -> 20782.58s]  This is the strangest video game mechanic I've ever seen.
[20783.14s -> 20835.46s]  You must work harder, student.
[20835.46s -> 20836.74s]  Just repeatedly punch.
[20836.74s -> 20840.66s]  You'll need to work harder to harness the awesome power of chi.
[20841.38s -> 20844.26s]  You may try again when you feel ready, student.
[20844.82s -> 20846.90s]  Yes, Grand Master Kai.
[20848.10s -> 20857.57s]  Good work.
[20869.17s -> 20871.73s]  This is- going in a circle?
[20871.73s -> 20875.33s]  No, this is- shake, punch the thing.
[20876.21s -> 20877.96s]  This one's not working.
[20883.03s -> 20885.99s]  All these people are like, dude, get in a circle and go up and down.
[20885.99s -> 20887.03s]  Move it in a circle.
[20896.00s -> 20897.76s]  Shake it as violently as you can.
[20898.48s -> 20913.19s]  Received tribute.
[20915.60s -> 20916.72s]  Well, I don't care about the tribute.
[20916.72s -> 20918.56s]  I'm just glad that I've got real estate now.
[20920.16s -> 20922.02s]  Imagine trusting me like that.
[20923.86s -> 20927.78s]  The tunnel will allow our hard-working people to relax and-
[20927.78s -> 20928.26s]  Save again.
[20929.22s -> 20934.98s]  Hold on, I need to-
[20934.98s -> 20937.38s]  Praise our culture through drink.
[20938.74s -> 20939.38s]  Okay, tavern.
[20939.38s -> 20940.34s]  More follower.
[20941.62s -> 20942.50s]  Is the game loud for you guys?
[20942.50s -> 20943.14s]  It's loud for me.
[20944.10s -> 20946.23s]  What happened?
[20946.23s -> 20946.79s]  Why is it loud?
[20948.23s -> 20949.51s]  We gain strength in such-
[20949.51s -> 20950.71s]  All right, temple is almost done.
[20951.59s -> 20952.79s]  We cannot fail.
[20954.15s -> 20954.79s]  Water the plants?
[20954.79s -> 20955.51s]  All right, how's he doing over here?
[20955.51s -> 20956.23s]  Are you still gathering?
[20957.52s -> 20959.20s]  All right, he's gonna hate me for this.
[20959.84s -> 20962.50s]  He doesn't want to gather forever.
[20964.05s -> 20968.45s]  Drinking weakens the senses of both builders and strategists.
[20968.45s -> 20968.93s]  How much-
[20968.93s -> 20969.73s]  Okay, we're good.
[20969.73s -> 20970.45s]  What do we need?
[20970.45s -> 20970.85s]  What do we need?
[20970.85s -> 20971.81s]  Do we have food?
[20972.45s -> 20973.25s]  More food.
[20974.21s -> 20975.30s]  I got-
[20975.30s -> 20977.38s]  Okay, am I gonna just fucking pull it up?
[20977.38s -> 20978.18s]  I'll do it myself.
[20982.93s -> 20986.56s]  That's fine.
[20986.56s -> 20986.88s]  Water.
[20987.52s -> 20996.10s]  What did I just do?
[20996.10s -> 20996.42s]  I got-
[20997.06s -> 21001.41s]  All right, food is now not an issue anymore.
[21001.41s -> 21001.97s]  Water again?
[21007.11s -> 21008.47s]  Buy myriads of spells.
[21008.47s -> 21009.35s]  Yeah, let's go.
[21009.91s -> 21012.48s]  It's time to buy some spells.
[21013.12s -> 21018.29s]  Advanced builder.
[21019.17s -> 21020.05s]  Heal miracle.
[21022.13s -> 21023.17s]  Lightning miracle.
[21023.17s -> 21024.21s]  75,000?
[21024.21s -> 21025.09s]  Should I give him lightning again?
[21025.09s -> 21025.57s]  Like he used to.
[21025.57s -> 21026.69s]  He loved lightning before.
[21027.65s -> 21033.64s]  He's getting it.
[21034.20s -> 21036.28s]  All right, what else can I do?
[21036.28s -> 21037.16s]  Rest home?
[21037.16s -> 21037.72s]  Lumber mill.
[21037.72s -> 21038.36s]  That's what I want.
[21039.00s -> 21046.63s]  Are we doing on crops?
[21049.27s -> 21049.83s]  More.
[21049.83s -> 21052.26s]  We need houses?
[21053.14s -> 21054.74s]  Are we actually having children born now?
[21055.54s -> 21060.74s]  Happiness bonus.
[21060.74s -> 21062.26s]  How are there no kids in the town?
[21065.51s -> 21068.15s]  There's 12 breeders.
[21068.15s -> 21069.03s]  How are there no kids?
[21069.75s -> 21075.25s]  177 adults.
[21075.97s -> 21078.95s]  Is it-
[21078.95s -> 21079.59s]  Are we foe?
[21080.39s -> 21087.70s]  Do we need more homes?
[21088.26s -> 21095.96s]  All right, I'm doing it, though.
[21095.96s -> 21096.28s]  I'm-
[21096.28s -> 21097.32s]  Okay, I'm gonna do them over here.
[21098.04s -> 21100.50s]  I'm gonna have another street over here.
[21101.30s -> 21122.24s]  You're in the boring suburbs?
[21123.44s -> 21129.43s]  Oh, we gotta make sure we hit all these.
[21129.99s -> 21148.21s]  All right, let's go.
[21152.07s -> 21154.87s]  These Greeks are expanding their territory.
[21154.87s -> 21156.79s]  We must remain vigilant.
[21159.56s -> 21161.78s]  This game's so much fun.
[21177.94s -> 21178.50s]  How are we doing on-
[21186.31s -> 21188.63s]  I want to take this mission very, very, very slow.
[21189.75s -> 21192.96s]  You know?
[21192.96s -> 21194.16s]  I want to make sure we're prepared.
[21194.72s -> 21196.16s]  And I'm gonna use diplomacy first.
[21196.98s -> 21197.86s]  Not fireballs.
[21197.86s -> 21201.70s]  Not mounting somebody and punching them in the face until they're dead.
[21202.34s -> 21202.98s]  Diplomacy.
[21206.72s -> 21207.84s]  All right, we need a-
[21207.84s -> 21209.67s]  We're here.
[21209.67s -> 21213.36s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[21213.36s -> 21213.92s]  Better, better, better.
[21213.92s -> 21214.80s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21214.80s -> 21215.30s]  Ah!
[21218.87s -> 21221.75s]  Start the construction of the Siren Wonder.
[21222.39s -> 21224.82s]  Oh, this is bad.
[21225.94s -> 21226.44s]  What?
[21228.84s -> 21231.56s]  Noooo!
[21232.12s -> 21232.92s]  Okay, connected.
[21233.88s -> 21237.72s]  A migration is waiting at our borders for you to accept them.
[21237.72s -> 21238.22s]  Who?
[21239.45s -> 21239.95s]  Oh.
[21240.25s -> 21240.75s]  Hi, guys.
[21245.75s -> 21247.11s]  Pretty cool area you got here.
[21247.83s -> 21251.58s]  I'll be taking it.
[21251.58s -> 21253.26s]  All right, finally, there's children playing.
[21254.06s -> 21258.66s]  All right, Murius is gonna get bored.
[21258.66s -> 21260.10s]  Uh, look at all this food.
[21260.10s -> 21260.82s]  Murius, you're done?
[21261.54s -> 21263.35s]  Please, just cease what you're doing.
[21264.07s -> 21264.87s]  Be an entertainer.
[21265.51s -> 21269.56s]  Just hang out in the middle of the town.

[25576.61s -> 25581.76s]  do something fun and I'll bring a cake well what a perfect opportunity to have
[25581.76s -> 25588.40s]  us announce the next community night the next community night is going to be you
[25588.40s -> 25594.42s]  ready let me make sure I get this right because I have a things plan let's see
[25594.42s -> 25606.01s]  going boing boing then the next community night is going to be Sunday
[25606.01s -> 25618.26s]  March 1st March 1st Sunday we're gonna do community night before it'd be pretty
[25618.26s -> 25629.72s]  fun that quick this yeah there's a ton of submissions is a lot of so but you
[25629.72s -> 25639.70s]  guys have been putting in so much stuff community crack night now that was that
[25639.70s -> 25644.40s]  wasn't even today and by the way let me what the hell was going on today what
[25644.40s -> 25652.55s]  was going on today I look over at the chat room and people just going crazy
[25652.55s -> 25669.46s]  people were going nuts it was just like just spam for like 30 minutes I understand
[25669.46s -> 25677.13s]  spam is fun spam can be fun but I'm not sure there was one comment but anything
[25677.13s -> 25683.12s]  that we were doing it was just like copy pastas and people screaming at each other
[25683.12s -> 25698.10s]  and we got we got a we got a hit way omega low cringe community who cares
[25698.10s -> 25709.21s]  game sucks the game what how could you say that some of you guys were fucking
[25709.21s -> 25720.83s]  seeing red it was a wink I'll get it don't worry don't it's just it was
[25720.83s -> 25726.13s]  messy and it was going so fast too that's the thing it's not even about oh
[25726.13s -> 25747.68s]  wow there's some spam oh it was a hundred miles per it was just crazy this
[25747.68s -> 25757.02s]  is what it's like for you now it's not a community it's chat it's alright though
[25757.02s -> 25767.96s]  I just we're stream 2020 what are you talking about I like had a ton of fun
[25767.96s -> 25773.87s]  playing but they were non subs I don't believe that for a second I saw some
[25773.87s -> 25782.09s]  subscribers in there throwing mud at each other this game's fucking hilarious
[25782.09s -> 25786.73s]  and fun and interesting we talked about oh where's chat experience I see well
[25786.73s -> 25798.84s]  put it on the list put on the list put on six months up mode as the channel
[25798.84s -> 25802.44s]  grows and this is I know this is a road that I have to figure out what I want to
[25802.44s -> 25809.69s]  do about it and I don't think we've really talked about it but when when
[25809.69s -> 25815.24s]  there are there's really two ways you can really moderate a community I know a
[25815.24s -> 25820.64s]  chat room it's like either just let it fly and fucking it's whatever and just
[25820.64s -> 25824.44s]  anything it's just people just writing anything besides obviously the pain of
[25824.44s -> 25829.40s]  shit that you don't want your chat room or you have to really really moderate
[25829.40s -> 25832.80s]  and have very strict rules and potentially even have it on permanent
[25832.80s -> 25844.07s]  like sub only mode it's it's really difficult to balance in the middle and I
[25844.07s -> 25849.32s]  really don't know which one of them I would rather have because it's it's
[25849.32s -> 25854.58s]  tough because on one hand I want there to be people just engaging and having
[25854.58s -> 25858.70s]  fun and you know just talking shit and having a good time and being able to
[25858.70s -> 25861.62s]  write whatever they want as long as it's you know relevant to what the fuck we're
[25861.62s -> 25866.16s]  doing and like in the community or whatever but then you know you get to
[25866.20s -> 25871.92s]  the point where is it just like people writing just spam that has nothing to do
[25871.92s -> 25875.52s]  with anything it's just I'm just gonna write this because I decided to and which
[25875.52s -> 25880.90s]  one of those roads do you want to take and as this channel gets to a point
[25880.90s -> 25885.74s]  with is but sometimes it's you know five plus thousand six thousand plus people
[25885.74s -> 25892.10s]  at the same time I figure out how I want to do I want to have a more strictly
[25892.10s -> 25898.02s]  moderated chat that's you know very very strict and people we can actually read
[25898.02s -> 25901.02s]  the chat and communicate or do I want like a let's get a fuck who fucking
[25901.02s -> 25917.04s]  cares it's hard to do something in the middle 30 minutes slow mode 12 month
[25917.04s -> 25925.36s]  only mode that would be so bad I don't think it's even about more mods it's
[25925.36s -> 25937.92s]  just how I want the community and the chat to be enforced but you you get to
[25937.92s -> 25942.56s]  that the end of the road where there's the cliff there and like there's two
[25942.56s -> 25949.27s]  where there's two ways to jump they increase the moderation and maybe have
[25949.27s -> 25953.27s]  sub only on sometimes because this is like a shitload of potential this shit
[25953.27s -> 25959.63s]  lot of people here or just whatever it just take out like the bad stuff but
[25959.63s -> 25964.88s]  just kind of let it ride and have people say kind of whatever they want it's it's
[25964.88s -> 25975.12s]  tricky I don't mind chaos I mind people posting in bad faith just to cause
[25975.12s -> 25981.56s]  trouble but that what that but that's what I'm saying this with a highly
[25981.56s -> 25989.64s]  moderated chat that is almost it's hard for that to happen moderate the off
[25989.64s -> 25996.28s]  topic stuff and I and I can be sort of guilty of this myself because I like to
[25996.28s -> 26000.48s]  just say shit that people you know you guys will look over be like oh hey
[26000.48s -> 26003.00s]  something about this what about that and then I know people are gonna fucking
[26003.00s -> 26014.47s]  just start spamming and you know I'm saying that's fun so how do you manage
[26014.47s -> 26030.86s]  that too it's a lot it's I'm thinking about I'm thinking about it and I know I
[26030.86s -> 26034.30s]  thought this this is not I don't like having these conversations because but
[26034.30s -> 26041.83s]  you kind of have to have them because it's I'm not gonna pretend like oh yeah
[26041.83s -> 26046.15s]  there's people are fucking like screaming in the chat and there's the
[26046.15s -> 26050.99s]  same copypasta thousand times and the same link has been posted a hundred
[26050.99s -> 26056.63s]  times and there I saw one guy say something about the cow and it is kind
[26056.63s -> 26070.77s]  of there beater only mode I actually brought it well it's not that I haven't
[26070.77s -> 26074.73s]  brought up we talked about this last week about I'm gonna put a separate
[26074.73s -> 26083.87s]  place for links for images and I like having a fun chat and don't get me
[26083.87s -> 26090.19s]  wrong I fucking love the chaos but we might have to do some controlled chaos
[26090.19s -> 26102.99s]  chaos control as Shadow the Hedgehog once said and he was on to something and
[26102.99s -> 26119.14s]  this is I'm not like mad I'm not upset about anything which is it's just
[26119.14s -> 26126.49s]  something we need to talk about we got to talk about it I'm not mad as obviously
[26126.49s -> 26136.68s]  if I was you would probably know it's just as we go forward you got to think
[26136.68s -> 26142.94s]  about some ways to control the chaos but also let the chaos through let's see
[26142.94s -> 26155.48s]  he's disappointed no no no no not at all I'm not disappointed I'm not angry now
[26155.48s -> 26158.04s]  if you excuse me I have to mute my mic for a minute
[26158.04s -> 26171.04s]  I swear fuck go fucking every single fucking time I'm not I there's nothing
[26171.04s -> 26178.14s]  wrong all right we'll move on that's all I want to say hey seven layer Wario

[26285.08s -> 26288.72s]  though like that I don't want to do that I don't want to like you can only write
[26288.72s -> 26295.13s]  one message every fucking 15 minutes every 5-10 minutes just like I don't
[26295.13s -> 26304.37s]  want to do that I like when people have fun if you're sitting in the chat and
[26304.37s -> 26307.65s]  you can only write like once every 10 minutes no that's not you're not
[26307.65s -> 26314.29s]  chatting you're posting your post there are people that tweet more than once
[26314.29s -> 26318.29s]  every 10 minutes and that's how long that's what I'm allowing you to fucking
[26318.29s -> 26342.64s]  chat in my stream Sam and Max 30-minute slow-mo was a fun joke yeah it was but

[27253.38s -> 27268.32s]  channel no that's not what I said oh they say it wrong what if we don't have
[27268.32s -> 27272.58s]  internet just no I'm not gonna that was a bad would've been weird if I just said
[27272.58s -> 27286.79s]  that but no we just have to be careful guys because and let's let's address it
[27286.79s -> 27291.83s]  now I've seen some of the fighting that happens in the chat it seems some of
[27291.83s -> 27296.71s]  this shit you know somebody will do like a trans pride emote for instance and all
[27296.71s -> 27301.28s]  of a sudden it's like okay well let's have a gigantic fight in the chat and
[27301.28s -> 27304.56s]  we're just let's just derail everything we're not even talking about the game
[27305.56s -> 27315.40s]  and people are just fucking screaming at each other that this this is this
[27315.40s -> 27328.09s]  stream is for us to have fun and hang out and have a good time people will do
[27328.09s -> 27336.24s]  that don't care about trans pride no I'm well aware I'm well aware of all look
[27336.24s -> 27342.40s]  there are people that see a trans pride emote and they just fucking say
[27342.40s -> 27347.44s]  something horrible and then that gets a reaction of people that are just like
[27347.44s -> 27350.12s]  it's an emote and then that starts a fight and then that starts a fight it's
[27350.12s -> 27354.61s]  like fuck you fuck you it's like whoa whoa whoa whoa that's this is not what
[27354.61s -> 27362.80s]  we're doing here this is not what we're doing here we are not gonna have fights
[27362.80s -> 27371.93s]  about people's identities and people's fucking preferences and and and gay
[27371.93s -> 27378.39s]  straight trans that doesn't matter to me it shouldn't matter to you but again I
[27378.39s -> 27383.44s]  would like I said previously we got to talk about spam we have to talk about
[27383.68s -> 27389.99s]  people just writing shit and writing whatever they want and then going forward
[27389.99s -> 27399.28s]  how I want to moderate the channel German nihilism no more messages and you
[27399.28s -> 27408.21s]  say this during a live stream as I'm doing it now can't ask for feet cam
[27408.21s -> 27417.60s]  anymore I just want everybody to fucking have a good time I don't like looking
[27417.60s -> 27424.94s]  over and seeing that this just people fighting in this community about this
[27424.94s -> 27432.64s]  shit and it's not even why is it people even fighting over this I think everybody
[27432.64s -> 27446.47s]  needs to fucking kind of internalize this in maybe pump the brakes a little you
[27446.47s -> 27450.15s]  should block trans pride if it's bothering you no no that that's not I
[27450.15s -> 27455.74s]  don't why would I I'm not gonna ban emotes that's just that's absurd I mean
[27455.74s -> 27474.08s]  no that's not feel like I joined at a bad time no what this we're just going
[27474.08s -> 27480.24s]  over and I've seen it I've seen it and I've tried to kind of change the
[27480.24s -> 27484.72s]  conversation a little bit try to get away from people arguing and chat about
[27484.72s -> 27491.60s]  this stuff but I do want to make it really clear that I would like us to
[27491.60s -> 27497.66s]  fucking be able to get along I don't want people to be down to each other's
[27497.66s -> 27504.49s]  throats when I'm like I'm like fucking throw like I said I'm gonna use this as
[27504.49s -> 27509.37s]  a perfect example because it's a great example if I'm throwing rocks at people
[27510.21s -> 27518.51s]  and like eating people on screen if I'm like surfing on a way I don't want to
[27518.51s -> 27521.79s]  it's it sucks to look over and see people fucking hate each other it's just
[27521.79s -> 27527.35s]  not it's it sucks it's not cool I don't like it that's not what this community
[27527.35s -> 27540.82s]  is for it's not why that's not what this community should stand for we're here to
[27540.82s -> 27556.63s]  have fun and enjoy each other's company full stop end of story now we're here to
[27556.63s -> 27565.22s]  make fun of you and there's a difference between banter and people
[27565.22s -> 27570.28s]  actually getting truly upset at each other us walking around back and forth
[27570.28s -> 27587.79s]  we do it all the time people that have problem with the emotes should be banned
[27587.79s -> 27593.92s]  because they bring negativity well also I mean there's I talked to some of the
[27593.92s -> 27598.93s]  mods about it and there's potential of people writing like for instance like
[27598.93s -> 27604.53s]  the trance pride emote a bunch of times specifically maybe to try to bait
[27604.57s -> 27614.04s]  somebody to be angry with them I think we've gotten there and that's what
[27614.04s -> 27618.94s]  that's what happens and then real people then start to get angry with each other
[27618.94s -> 27643.06s]  we do yeah we did discuss that yeah internet doesn't change that's what I'm
[27643.06s -> 27647.28s]  just saying we have to be careful because you don't you don't want to start
[27647.28s -> 27652.48s]  fucking screaming at somebody and the mods are we we haven't had we're
[27652.48s -> 27656.76s]  supposed to be doing another kind of state of the channel mod meeting I'm
[27656.80s -> 27663.64s]  sure if it's something guys the discord have seen us in the Archmages tower
[27663.64s -> 27667.16s]  sometimes you just see a bunch of names and I'm in there too we go over stuff we
[27667.16s -> 27672.84s]  talk about this stuff and we want to find out ways to make it so it's
[27672.84s -> 27695.06s]  enjoyable for everybody it's it is still called the Archmages tower I love how
[27695.06s -> 27703.80s]  much we still talk about so it's such a huge part of my entire life but
[27703.80s -> 27711.34s]  hopefully hopefully we can start to move on from that because I've made my stance
[27711.34s -> 27716.40s]  clear that I'm in full support I think over the years you guys have heard me
[27716.40s -> 27722.80s]  say it plenty of times don't want to see you guys fucking hating each other not
[27722.80s -> 27735.92s]  here not at all and not ever we got to get over this shit anyways kind of pack
[27735.92s -> 27756.84s]  that on to the conversation we had like 20 minutes ago acting like what movements
[27756.84s -> 27762.18s]  were a political well I'm not even talking about like it politics versus
[27762.18s -> 27766.38s]  not politics versus socially I'm just saying in general my main problem is
[27766.38s -> 27769.22s]  looking over here and see people actually really upset with each other
[27769.22s -> 27780.54s]  because this is new this is only within the last probably six months or so I've
[27780.54s -> 27796.76s]  been around for ten years this is new I've never really talked about this like
[27796.76s -> 27803.05s]  this in this kind of candid way so why I'm spending a little extra time on it
[27803.05s -> 27823.29s]  anyways we will continue the conversation that needed to happen yeah
[27823.33s -> 27830.91s]  it did it did and I'm actually glad that we could I could bring it up moving on

[27922.28s -> 27926.64s]  imagine I've been trying to make you read this on stream for like a month it's
[27926.64s -> 27933.10s]  okay you can't pronounce my username okay bye and this says German will never
[27933.10s -> 27936.46s]  move to Philadelphia and just happen to be not only in the same apartment
[27936.46s -> 27940.74s]  complex as mine but right next to door and I introduced myself by giving him
[27940.74s -> 27944.46s]  cookies and he's like the fuck are these I don't eat sugar all the time like you
[27944.46s -> 27952.71s]  do fatty and he slaps a plate out of my hands what what what was this so

[27959.28s -> 27966.04s]  important it just is all right well thank you for the five dollars it Kiko
[27966.04s -> 27972.64s]  second part of your name thank you though seriously sorry for fucking up
[27972.64s -> 27977.08s]  your name every time all the swag thanks for this five dollars if you
[27977.08s -> 27994.38s]  thought about doing a test stream with stricter rules to see how it feels it's
[27994.38s -> 28007.71s]  so tough for me I just want it's hard yes I have absolutely sure do a test
[28007.71s -> 28014.16s]  stream on master of comedy people are gonna be worse I think that initially
[28014.16s -> 28017.72s]  something like that would be bad for a while but then people would just get
[28017.72s -> 28023.11s]  used to it and that's just that's just your chat after a while but the problem
[28023.15s -> 28030.32s]  is and here's the real problem I've been doing this for so long with the same
[28030.32s -> 28039.16s]  kind of rules for six straight years that that's a big change because I've
[28039.16s -> 28045.42s]  been doing it for so long if I just started streaming six months ago that's
[28045.42s -> 28055.46s]  different but we've had the same kind of rules for a long time so has it been six
[28055.46s -> 28060.78s]  years I started streaming on twitch my channel got partnered in like 2014 or
[28060.82s -> 28067.48s]  2015 I've been streaming on twitch since like 2014 or so 2015 he's like
[28067.48s -> 28078.37s]  that's when I got partnered we need more mods maybe we'll do like a fucking big
[28078.37s -> 28084.19s]  mod maybe I was gonna do a lot of apocalypse before maybe we need to do a
[28084.19s -> 28102.00s]  mod knighting ceremony mod lottery thermostyle is to have mods snipe out
[28102.00s -> 28107.39s]  the trolls but it's hard with such a big audience yeah I do not take this lightly
[28107.39s -> 28110.51s]  at all and I know people going well man you stand you've been a real long
[28110.51s -> 28114.19s]  fucking time on this it means a lot to me because I want people to enjoy this
[28114.19s -> 28120.20s]  stream I want you to be able to shitpost I want you to be able to fucking say the
[28120.20s -> 28124.32s]  things you want to say and have fun but you know I got a fucking reel it in
[28124.32s -> 28133.96s]  that's just that's it but we have one more here well no two more actually
[28133.96s -> 28140.00s]  Avery drop dead thanks to the 250 German if you could read this privately it
[28140.00s -> 28155.42s]  appreciated okay we'll do thank you for the 250 thank you everything is being
[28155.42s -> 28161.00s]  looked at and talked about so don't worry thank you finally uber morph point
[28161.00s -> 28165.00s]  thanks for the $15 1500 bits I sincerely appreciate your will to stomp out
[28165.00s -> 28168.76s]  negativity in your community so many content creators let those parts fester
[28168.76s -> 28182.81s]  and become worse I think I think the word like stomp out negativity is I mean not
[28182.85s -> 28196.57s]  necessarily correct because I don't want look if you tell somebody that they're
[28196.57s -> 28201.38s]  stupid and they're wrong and they're an idiot you bet you that you'd make that
[28201.38s -> 28219.83s]  person fucking even more angry and hateful you know I'm saying it's hard
[28219.83s -> 28227.25s]  trying to you know push people in a more positive direction but without
[28227.25s -> 28234.16s]  telling them like wow you are sure are a fucking idiot like oh yeah I'm a
[28234.16s -> 28253.61s]  fucking idiot huh you're a fucking idiot it's tricky nice political debate some
[28253.61s -> 28257.85s]  people just some some people and some people are just playing out to cause
[28257.85s -> 28264.85s]  chaos yeah I know that's why it's so tricky because like stomping out
[28264.85s -> 28268.45s]  negativity is like what if the negativity is coming from a place of
[28268.45s -> 28273.41s]  somebody just trying to make a problem because they haven't but that's what
[28273.41s -> 28278.85s]  they're doing for fun then you have like two potential negativity sources that
[28278.85s -> 28289.02s]  are coming at each other it's just just riling shit up yeah haha who would do
[28289.02s -> 28314.82s]  that you can't act like both sides are equally at fault no absolutely not like
[28314.82s -> 28321.38s]  if you're like a bigot or like a racist and shit like like yeah you shouldn't
[28321.38s -> 28324.50s]  fucking be like that like don't you don't be like that that's not that's
[28324.50s -> 28340.39s]  not good that's really not fucking good but it's sometimes not that easy to
[28340.39s -> 28348.60s]  simply just say those things because the person listening might not give a shit
[28348.60s -> 28369.92s]  about anything you're saying it's actually really tricky you ended racism
[28370.08s -> 28389.58s]  CEO of racism oh my god I was here all right all right you did it all right we
[28389.58s -> 28405.84s]  did it god but this stuff is hard to talk about because when I turn my streams
[28405.84s -> 28410.88s]  on I don't I don't turn my stream on with the idea of well you know I'm gonna
[28410.88s -> 28416.65s]  talk about a bunch of issues today let me talk about all the bad shit in the
[28417.21s -> 28425.47s]  world I mean that's not what I'm doing here that's not the point of this stream
[28425.47s -> 28440.00s]  it never has and it never will be but sometimes we can you know somewhere when
[28440.00s -> 28442.76s]  I feel comfortable doing it you know we talk about it like we're doing right
[28442.76s -> 28459.76s]  now stop to talk about it I've lost somebody wink points trying to get him
[28459.76s -> 28472.57s]  to read please say it again when there isn't what's not the end of the stream
[28472.57s -> 28479.16s]  most people who need to hear this message already left he's bullying me
[28479.16s -> 28493.56s]  what I didn't what I just read it it really bothers me that no matter how
[28493.56s -> 28500.36s]  long this ending sequence is popcorns never cleaned I just want to watch funny
[28500.36s -> 28505.56s]  man play video game and not have to see you deal with spam we're working on it
[28505.56s -> 28514.16s]  and we're it's it's a hard to it's hard to do that's not don't think I don't
[28514.16s -> 28525.44s]  think about this all the time I do and I'm gonna be completely upfront and
[28525.88s -> 28533.49s]  this this is not something that has been really in the back of my mind it's this
[28533.49s -> 28538.05s]  is not like a we got a fucking talk chat it's just recently there's been some
[28538.05s -> 28547.40s]  fighting and I'd like to see it stop I turn on my stream and I just let's go
