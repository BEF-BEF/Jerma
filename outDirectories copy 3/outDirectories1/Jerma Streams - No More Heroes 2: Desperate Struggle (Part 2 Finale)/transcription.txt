[1.02s -> 18.22s]  Good afternoon, hi hello everybody. You know how much your turnips are? I know.
[18.22s -> 21.74s]  Okay, you know what? No, I do know. My turnips every day are worth
[23.83s -> 32.87s]  12, 10 bells for a stack. So you don't want to, my island sucks. You don't want to come to visit my,
[32.87s -> 38.81s]  they're worthless. See? And they're worthless every day. 12 bells a stack. Yeah, it's bad.
[39.61s -> 42.74s]  So now people don't need to know. Don't come to me.
[43.62s -> 56.57s]  Does that like shove the fucking gold bars under the bed? My turnips are worthless. He's got...
[57.98s -> 69.53s]  Yo, Jerma. Yo, hey. Is he playing No More Heroes? Yo. Yo. Yes, how are you? I played it yesterday.
[69.53s -> 79.32s]  Were you here yesterday? I'm probably at like the 40%, 30% point in the game.
[80.84s -> 87.66s]  The idea is to try to finish this today. And if I don't, then we'll finish it tomorrow
[88.30s -> 98.63s]  and do something else after it's done. I had to go early yesterday. Is the cat still a fat boy?
[99.85s -> 107.22s]  Uh, well, you'll see. So here's the plan. Here comes the remainder of the week. I'll give it to you.
[108.10s -> 114.49s]  No More Heroes 2 tonight. Trying to finish it tonight. If I finish it tonight, then I'm playing
[114.49s -> 122.58s]  Resident Evil 3 Remake tomorrow. Hopefully finishing that in one stream too. On Thursday,
[123.62s -> 129.45s]  if that's the case, I beat this today, beat Resident Evil 3 tomorrow. And on Thursday,
[129.45s -> 135.61s]  we're going to get a special treat of Tiny Toon's Wacky Sports and maybe one other Super Nintendo
[135.61s -> 145.67s]  game of my choosing. Now this plan falls apart if I do not beat this tonight. If I still have
[146.47s -> 151.27s]  another two, three, four plus hours of content in No More Heroes 2, then I'm going to play it
[151.27s -> 158.20s]  tomorrow. And then when it's done, gauge the environment and see if there's enough time for
[158.20s -> 166.07s]  me to do Tiny Toon's Wacky Sports and then do Resident Evil 3 on Thursday. Or potentially
[166.07s -> 172.63s]  the start of the next week. I'm not sure yet, but Resident Evil 3 will happen. We'll see.
[174.10s -> 180.52s]  Don't stall and start. That's been three minutes. We need every moment to make sure you can beat
[180.52s -> 191.11s]  this. Every single second counts today. Dude, every second counts today. All right. All right.
[194.58s -> 205.40s]  I'm ready. Oh, he's stalling. I'm not stalling. It's been four minutes. Don't make me put on the
[205.40s -> 212.87s]  anime. I will. All right. Let's go. He caught us. He hasn't been here since yesterday.
[214.31s -> 227.21s]  We're No More Heroes 2. This is the sequel. I tried that. Wait, didn't I? Oh, right. I opened
[227.21s -> 233.56s]  it once and said, no, I'm done. Okay. I remember. I'm going to do, how much money do I have?
[235.74s -> 245.00s]  I'm ready for the next mission. Love this series, bro. Yeah. I can't wait for the third one.
[246.44s -> 255.67s]  Oh, I forgot you can press B. Wait, who was that?
[258.23s -> 263.21s]  I read the tweet and thought it was Neo 2. No, not Neo 2.
[269.45s -> 274.01s]  Hey, that's true. The paper boy's a genius. Does anybody else feel like if you stood in
[274.01s -> 277.53s]  one of those, it would just make you shit? Anyway, I'd have to go to the bathroom in five
[277.53s -> 282.49s]  minutes after that happened. It's just shaking you and vibrating all your intestines and stuff.
[282.49s -> 287.37s]  Yes, the association resorts to this when there isn't much activity in the rankings
[287.37s -> 293.61s]  or when there are too many strong fighters or sometimes when we just get bored. If you're like,
[293.61s -> 299.77s]  Jerma, I'll give you $10,000 if you drink a full coffee and stand in one of those for 12 minutes
[299.77s -> 306.41s]  and not have to go to the bathroom. I'd probably lose. If you win, you'll jump to the 10th rank.
[307.45s -> 312.97s]  Damn, that's a twisted way to do things. You agents are becoming as fucked up as the killers
[312.97s -> 320.65s]  you rep. Oh, we've always been fucked up as you say. We just we like fortnight. You guys
[320.65s -> 326.33s]  fucked up assassins working with fucked up agents. Doesn't get any better than this.
[326.33s -> 333.30s]  Mature streamer. I'm just keeping it on permanently. No doubt. I'll kill them all in a flash.
[334.90s -> 339.03s]  I put that on for the drug stream and then I never took it off and I'm never going to take it off.
[339.91s -> 355.54s]  Okay, so we got ranking battle. Let's go. Oh, destroy man. Wait, is destroy man in this?
[356.18s -> 365.46s]  Is he? I don't remember. Is it actually destroy man?
[378.70s -> 383.50s]  I don't know why. In my brain, she's playing hand simulator. That's like a hand simulator setup
[384.46s -> 386.62s]  to dial the phone number. Why am I thinking that?
[392.76s -> 400.36s]  He's trying hard not to talk about. No, I'm fine.
[407.70s -> 416.94s]  Damn, is it my turn yet? Anybody work here? This is taken forever. Open the gate so I can kick some
[416.94s -> 436.87s]  ass. What's that meme? Did it work? Connect the legs. Somebody do it. The game is stalling.
[436.87s -> 446.60s]  What is your sense of suggest carnage? This guy who is my next victim? Question.
[447.40s -> 451.40s]  Surprise task. You are identified as Travis touchdown.
[452.04s -> 458.20s]  Luck is an irrational concept, but your presence defies probability. Do you remember me? Question.
[458.20s -> 463.67s]  I do. He died last game. I don't know who or what the fuck. Wait a second.
[463.67s -> 473.00s]  Oh, yeah, you're that fifth ranked freak Henry sliced up before I got the chance to.
[473.00s -> 478.12s]  It's going to happen again, right? It has to. Affirmative. After near fatal decimation,
[478.12s -> 484.36s]  I had no choice but to take this modified form. Looks to me like you just gained a few pounds.
[485.72s -> 492.76s]  Hardware was affected, but my pride was not. With determination levels maximum, I thought only of
[492.76s -> 500.20s]  winning. It was meaningless, futile, illogical. But such is the curse of being run by a human brain.
[503.99s -> 510.07s]  That brain also makes you talk about desert. Why is that always funny shit? But if you want to
[510.07s -> 520.07s]  take it out on me, go ahead. All I desire is a duel with you. Desire level 100%. Revenge on primary
[520.07s -> 529.83s]  target was previously accomplished. So Henry makes a cameo before fighting you. I elected to
[529.83s -> 537.35s]  defeat formally top ranked assassin as practice sequence. This was same individual on whom I
[537.35s -> 545.59s]  also desire vengeance. Efficient turn of events. Do you agree? Would you shut up? I just need to
[545.59s -> 550.23s]  make one thing clear. I'm not going to kill you because of Henry. I'm going to kill you
[550.23s -> 556.87s]  because your big metal ass is in my way. I love that saver. Activating main engine.
[556.87s -> 559.91s]  I already know this routine. We actually do have to fight it.
[562.39s -> 580.70s]  That was quick. Is it going to be a maze? I hope not. Pretty fast for a tin can. Now it's my turn.
[581.88s -> 584.28s]  Shit, we actually fight it. I thought it was going to be another joke.
[584.76s -> 601.96s]  Activating engine. Let's go. Half is the floor. Okay, that hurt a lot. That almost instantly
[601.96s -> 613.67s]  killed me. All right. Oh, this is safe. This is a safe spot. Okay, I get it. The ones that don't move.
[614.79s -> 639.58s]  Come here. Oh shit. I got to go get on that one. Where are we going? Oh shit, this is not going to
[639.58s -> 654.20s]  work out, is it? Holy shit, this thing is powerful. Okay, easy, easy, easy. Stop,
[654.20s -> 658.60s]  stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Find a good spot to stand. Where, where, where, where, where?
[661.62s -> 671.40s]  Oh, wait for him to move. Wait for him to move. What's this? What's that?
[673.80s -> 675.96s]  Jesus. Okay, I can dodge that, I think.
[676.68s -> 685.50s]  Oh, it says I don't like this. I don't like the extreme explosive noise that pops up.
[686.94s -> 703.30s]  Come here. I'm safe right next to him. Yes. All right, this ain't so bad. This ain't so bad.
[703.30s -> 728.92s]  Don't be an idiot. Okay, easy. Wait. Okay. Oh God. Oh God. It's not safe.
[729.40s -> 740.79s]  Oh, it hit me in the face. That wasn't safe. It got like the corner of my mouth.
[743.88s -> 757.34s]  Oh fuck, did I dodge it? I think so. I don't know. It sliced off my nose.
[760.12s -> 774.26s]  Just move. Just move. Where's he going? Oh God. Oh God. I know, I say it a lot. Okay.
[774.26s -> 791.10s]  Okay. This is safe here. I need that health. All right, where's the health? There's a health box.
[801.45s -> 818.95s]  Fine. Oh my God. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm not okay. Shake everything. Shake
[818.95s -> 840.66s]  everything, right? Okay. How are you missing? What? Okay. I'm fine. Oh, he tried to get me with a
[840.66s -> 852.28s]  dive. I can't make it. It's so hard to deter me, man. It's so scary. All right. Is he going to move?
[853.16s -> 870.06s]  All right. I'm good. Bang. Again. Nope. Easy.
[881.38s -> 892.02s]  I'm too scared. I'm terrified of that. All right. Is he going to fly forward?
[892.90s -> 899.10s]  Is he going? Nope. He's going to do it right there.
[905.54s -> 928.79s]  Again. Again. All right. One more time. Don't move. Is he going? This is it. I win.
[930.82s -> 954.54s]  Okay. I'm fine. Game over. Boss dead. This is a scary one. Scary one for those disgusting sounds.
[955.77s -> 967.61s]  That was just me opening my mouth and closing it to talk. I just didn't do it.
[981.96s -> 984.84s]  What is it? Okay. I don't even know the origin of this. I don't even know what this is,
[984.92s -> 1012.33s]  but I've seen it. Hey, it kind of worked, I guess. Master. It's been a long time.
[1013.21s -> 1021.22s]  Shinobu. How did, wait, what did you say? Did you call me master? I don't have time for apprentices.
[1021.22s -> 1027.27s]  You have any idea how much pro wrestling is backlogged on my VCR? I came to tell you I got
[1027.27s -> 1033.48s]  back safely from Asia. You should be happy. I didn't even know you left. It's the lore.
[1034.04s -> 1041.77s]  I'm not your master. My only desire was to become strong like you, master. So I trained hard
[1041.77s -> 1049.13s]  and I thought to become the champion of Asia. Here's my belt. No way. You won this? That's
[1049.13s -> 1055.93s]  pretty badass. When I get married, I'm not getting a ring. I'm getting a championship belt
[1055.93s -> 1062.82s]  that you have to wear forever. Me? Overburdened? Who told you that? Sylvia. She said I should come
[1062.82s -> 1070.55s]  back and help you. What? Who's that bitch think she is? My nanny? Listen up, Shinobu. This is my
[1070.55s -> 1076.71s]  war. I don't need help from anybody. Well, the thing is, it's kind of too late for that.
[1078.55s -> 1084.15s]  What are you talking about? But isn't her arm gone yet? I'll explain later, master. But you
[1084.15s -> 1089.99s]  should go to the bathroom first. Seriously, it's a long story. We're going to get a lore dump.
[1089.99s -> 1108.58s]  But I'm not your goddamn master. We're going to get a lore dump. Oh, we went from 23 to 10.
[1109.46s -> 1119.00s]  Looks like we skipped a few. Oh, yes. It's that time again. It's time to activate the one guy
[1119.00s -> 1126.63s]  squad and tell them to play God Hand. Did you pay attention? No. Not at all. Sorry. Somebody says
[1126.63s -> 1139.66s]  it about God Hand. Yeah, I'll play it. July 30th or something. Something, something. July 30th.
[1140.54s -> 1148.42s]  Sorry for interrupting your time abroad, but will you fight for Travis? Sure.
[1149.14s -> 1155.78s]  I'm eager to kill, so hurry with the details. Straight to the point. I like that. Can you handle
[1155.78s -> 1161.46s]  two of our top ten? Two? Only two? That's nothing. Why don't I just take them all?
[1162.50s -> 1170.34s]  You've grown confident. Yeah, but not overconfident. Unlike you, I can see myself
[1170.34s -> 1179.46s]  objectively. Easy, vague, never. Don't forget your promise. What are you talking about?
[1179.46s -> 1185.75s]  I already gave you a hard date for that. You're not worth the stain on my blade.
[1187.58s -> 1196.97s]  That's just bad steel. Staining your blade. You must not have a fucking Kathy Mitchell copper pot.
[1198.14s -> 1211.21s]  Wait, that play is her. Jump. Hold A then release. Long range. Press A while jumping.
[1211.21s -> 1217.66s]  Jump attack. Press B while jumping. Flying attack. Oh, they've added a jump. That's all it took.
[1218.46s -> 1228.50s]  Let's do a long range attack. Well, that was fucking awesome. Can I play with this character
[1228.50s -> 1258.50s]  the rest of the game? Whoa. I took cash from the toilet. Small F. Emulated. Small F, that's my fault.
[1259.46s -> 1261.86s]  Don't worry. It's always my fault. Blame me for everything.
[1271.22s -> 1280.49s]  These quick slashes. Oh, I mean, yeah, I got a VPN. Come on VPN. So
[1281.53s -> 1286.92s]  that's to make, you know, it makes sense. Don't worry. It ain't gonna, this, this stream ain't
[1286.92s -> 1292.04s]  gonna, it's not gonna like turn off and not gonna fucking lose like 10,000 frames. It's just,
[1292.04s -> 1303.46s]  I'm going through a, if you ever heard of the term called a VPN, B E E P I A N VPN.
[1306.34s -> 1320.57s]  Designed to help with like traffic flow and where's this other person? Where is this person? Oh,
[1320.57s -> 1336.54s]  there you are. Can't go through the window. Damn it. All right. Long range, right? Let's go.
[1336.54s -> 1345.66s]  I want to do it. I'll do it. I've, this move is cool.
[1363.80s -> 1377.51s]  What is she saying? You have no moe? Are you fucking with me? Moe. Oh, it's moe.
[1378.55s -> 1393.08s]  Where's the last guy? Oh, there's a chest over here. Apologize for saying moe. Is that a word
[1393.08s -> 1398.28s]  that nobody wants me to say? That added to the banned list of words that streamer can't say.
[1399.24s -> 1402.92s]  There you are. Wait, you just were here, but now you're not here.
[1406.17s -> 1430.73s]  You just were here, but now you're not here. There you are. Meester. You're not even close
[1430.73s -> 1447.02s]  to meester. Holy shit, that was loud. This is like every roommate scenario when they're playing
[1447.02s -> 1460.04s]  Counter-Strike and you can hear them through the wall. Like dude, settle down, man. Dude,
[1460.04s -> 1502.60s]  he's kicking my ass. Dude. God. Cano wins. This fucking screen. It's like, dude, just,
[1502.60s -> 1508.76s]  I know, input lag sucks. That's why I don't play online video games that have precise inputs,
[1508.76s -> 1531.82s]  because it's like a quarter of a second delay. That's why I don't play them. People just keep
[1531.82s -> 1555.02s]  spawning. I'm going to get some blocks in here. That was sick. Long range. Bingo. Here comes a
[1555.02s -> 1559.22s]  bingo. I was listening to your stream when you were playing No More Heroes 2 and you did this
[1559.22s -> 1562.58s]  thing where you said bingo, bingo, and I fucking hated it. I couldn't get out of my seat.
[1563.54s -> 1567.30s]  See you next week when somebody sends that as a message. What's going on with the voice here?
[1567.30s -> 1585.22s]  That was weird. Somebody was in the middle of typing it, I'm sure. Well, this looks fun.
[1586.02s -> 1607.66s]  Sneak through. That was easy. She had another weapon. Just one weapon. She got one weapon.
[1616.38s -> 1625.66s]  The one-time thing, so no. Fuck it. Fuck it.
[1627.74s -> 1646.12s]  Shiva. No, she sent some gifts. That was awesome. There's money in here? Holy shit. That's a lot of
[1646.12s -> 1660.95s]  money. All right. Watch it. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Good. Pizza. Oh, it's a chainsaw guy.
[1660.95s -> 1672.01s]  Don't even let him. Oh my god. I tried to dodge. All right. Back up. Stop taunting. She gets up
[1672.01s -> 1722.01s]  and goes, you have no moa and I can't control it. Attack. Whoa. She says that every time.
[1723.05s -> 1741.78s]  You have no moa. Kill. Apologize. What's it mean? What's it mean? What does that mean when I say that?
[1742.26s -> 1755.19s]  What is moe? What's the word mean? It means you're not, it's you're not cute?
[1757.66s -> 1770.89s]  The anime term for cuteness. I thought that was kawaii. I thought kawaii was anime cute word. Same
[1770.89s -> 1783.16s]  thing. Oh, so what would, what would make somebody say moe over kawaii? What does kawaii have that
[1783.16s -> 1798.78s]  moe doesn't or the other way around? I have no idea. Okay. Thanks for the help guys. I could
[1798.78s -> 1824.39s]  rely on you in anime terms. Come on, get it. No, this is a Reddit chat. Um, I don't think it is
[1824.39s -> 1839.64s]  unless you're all pretending to hate it. Unless you guys really actually love that site and
[1840.36s -> 1847.72s]  you're pretending to hate it. Okay. I can't lock onto that. Uh, what can I go over to there?
[1849.83s -> 1871.42s]  Oh, that sucked. Is there another way to get up there? Okay. Yeah, I just,
[1872.54s -> 1879.13s]  apparently just didn't do it good enough. Just didn't do a good enough job. Just don't,
[1879.13s -> 1883.69s]  please. Did somebody learn from Gotcha Force and have the camera be in the right place? Gotcha
[1883.69s -> 1897.96s]  Force did it. Why can't everybody else do it? Well, I've, how did you miss? Do I actually have
[1897.96s -> 1904.46s]  to make this jump? I'm not going to make it. I told you. Like I wasn't, it's weird. It's
[1904.46s -> 1912.52s]  fucking weird. That's like a fucked up weird. I told you it's odd. It does. It's okay. I feel
[1912.52s -> 1944.60s]  like I'm crouch jumping in the source engine. That's how this feels. God. Okay. Where's the
[1944.60s -> 1963.80s]  last one? Oh, I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I can't. Oh, this is going to be in the ass.
[1963.80s -> 1979.13s]  I already said anime sucks. Whatever. I'm not even going to address that.
[1981.96s -> 1993.48s]  Unbelievable. I'm not even going to fucking address that. If you're going to the bathroom
[1993.48s -> 2008.07s]  in the shower, this is like the go to the bathroom save point. Wait, he showers and he shits. How
[2008.07s -> 2016.70s]  come he never takes a bath? Hey, thanks Ben for the five community subs. Appreciate it. Five subs
[2016.70s -> 2026.70s]  from Ben Eldor. Ben, welcome to the German mites. No, actually I get that. I screw up the way that
[2026.70s -> 2039.94s]  I say that usually the first or second time I did it right that first time. I'm going to hate this
[2039.94s -> 2053.02s]  fight. Who's there? Sorry, but I got to make this quick. Golden gun. It's a young girl. If you kill
[2053.02s -> 2061.77s]  me, you can fight Travis, but that's a huge it. You talk a lot of trash for a child. Let's get to
[2061.77s -> 2096.76s]  the fun. Done. Okay. I'm not going to go easy on you just because I fuck you. I'm not going to fuck you.
[2097.24s -> 2097.80s]  Come to this.
[2099.00s -> 2110.17s]  Where did he go? There he is. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it.
[2110.17s -> 2149.13s]  Holy shit. Come here. All right. Spring it together. Walk it. Fuck you. Why does everybody say
[2149.13s -> 2165.82s]  fuck? Walk up. Walk it. Oh, fuck. Walk. Walk. Walk. How many did he shoot? He shoots one,
[2165.82s -> 2172.38s]  two, three, four, five. Why can't I walk up the stairs? Hey.
[2172.38s -> 2203.27s]  Hey. This guy's nuts. Oh, fucking platforming. Oh, it's not designed. This game wasn't made for
[2203.27s -> 2221.22s]  this. I knew I was going to not like this part. I'm not going to go easy on you. He's freaking me
[2221.22s -> 2231.50s]  out. How did I not make that jump? That's just so wary. All right. It's one, two, three, walk.
[2232.46s -> 2264.95s]  This fucking thing up, man. Where? I don't even know. Where's the camera? Did he say money? I love
[2264.95s -> 2280.76s]  money. Is he below me? Okay, block. I'm not blocking. Oh, that's right. She taunts after
[2280.76s -> 2335.45s]  every attack I've got. Good. What are you not going to do? Don't jump over him. Dodge better
[2335.45s -> 2344.76s]  than anybody. Why is it not blocking? I'm blocking up. What the fuck are you doing?
[2345.64s -> 2383.03s]  Block. Block. Drop him. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Fuck. Why did I not block the other ones?
[2384.07s -> 2410.73s]  Where is he? You don't have anything else but two voice lines. Where even is this dude?
[2411.29s -> 2426.06s]  He's down here. It's what? Seven shots? One, two, three, four, five, six. I'm down one, two, three,
[2426.06s -> 2447.94s]  four. I don't even have the 50% health, man. It's almost trouble. Try to get in front of it.
[2450.89s -> 2454.87s]  Don't even let him shoot. Don't let him shoot. Don't let him shoot. Don't let him shoot a gun.
[2456.17s -> 2475.34s]  All right. Don't even let him shoot the gun. Suplex him. But you don't have any moves. She doesn't
[2475.34s -> 2484.63s]  watch wrestling. Really? Okay. I know the strategy. It's just don't let him attack.
[2485.59s -> 2494.73s]  Yeah. What are you talking about? She won the championship belt. She should know.
[2494.73s -> 2510.47s]  Okay. We got this in the bag. Don't let him get any shots off. All right. Get up there quick so I
[2510.47s -> 2523.80s]  can... Okay. What? You have to fucking wonder. You have to wonder. You have to take into
[2523.80s -> 2539.91s]  consideration the fact that this... Why? No. Don't eat that pizza. I better not get hit.
[2540.71s -> 2561.85s]  Oh, my fucking God. You got to be kidding me. Don't let him shoot. Don't let him. Don't let
[2561.85s -> 2569.21s]  him. Don't let him. What are you going to do about it? What do you think you're going to do?
[2571.69s -> 2576.01s]  He's stuck. He's stuck. He wants to shoot me so bad, but he's not going to ever.
[2577.61s -> 2592.79s]  He's not going to... Don't let him shoot you. Don't let him do it. He's so confident.
[2593.75s -> 2602.55s]  He's not... I cheese. I cheese. Spread it. You don't know anything about wrestling, I guess.
[2603.51s -> 2641.26s]  I broke him out of his spell. Store up. Another Counter-Strike roommate. No more heroes, too.
[2642.62s -> 2658.07s]  Desperate Counter-Strike. That was way easier than it would have been. No Moe heroes.
[2672.95s -> 2713.72s]  I can't talk. Come on. Oh, he's speaking. That's not how that works. Laughing my ass off.
[2722.04s -> 2731.19s]  What? Yeah, that's what I asked. Wait, she doesn't even know what it means?
[2739.85s -> 2753.29s]  Says it every five seconds. She doesn't even know what it is. That's so funny.
[2753.29s -> 2762.84s]  It's this bishop's grave. Yeah. Who's this? Were you friends? Yes. We never met in person,
[2762.84s -> 2769.00s]  but we knew each other well. We exchanged many letters even though our countries and
[2769.00s -> 2774.60s]  languages were different. That's like a fucking knife on his back. That's a big, huge sword.
[2775.24s -> 2784.04s]  I am very much indebted to him. He gave me courage. Oh, I'm just rambling. Don't mind me.
[2784.76s -> 2792.04s]  By any chance... Do you know his best friend, Travis? Of course. Excellent. In that case,
[2792.60s -> 2800.44s]  would you please give this to him? It is from Bishop. This? It is a lot of things, I suppose.
[2801.24s -> 2805.16s]  Knowing it is your hands, I can have peace of mind.
[2805.16s -> 2809.16s]  That looks like a type of shitty luggage you'd buy on Sky Mall trying to save space.
[2809.80s -> 2813.72s]  Thanks. I promise to deliver it. It fits under the seat.
[2821.43s -> 2827.11s]  Yeah. Shinobu, the next match is ready. On my way. This better be good.
[2827.11s -> 2851.11s]  Wait, is this the match? The rocket launcher. I wonder what it is. Oh, outdoor. Outdoor zone.
[2851.91s -> 2873.08s]  What you got there? I didn't see the second guy. He thought it was just one guy. Wait.
[2873.08s -> 2879.86s]  Secret. Can I get up there? Or is it... Do I eventually get over there?
[2880.90s -> 2897.99s]  I think I eventually get over there. Okay. On the ground. Kill now.
[2900.82s -> 2906.89s]  Why did he walk like the heavy? What do you mean?
[2907.61s -> 2913.70s]  Both of us are having trouble.
[2937.67s -> 2942.92s]  Yes. This ridiculously high streamer can't even do a Tetris puzzle.
[2943.80s -> 2954.89s]  Fucking yesterday. Everything opened up Tetris. What are you talking about?
[2954.89s -> 2968.46s]  I thought I could tell before I got out of the car. Now that would have been epic.
[2980.22s -> 2986.55s]  Everybody's so vulgar. Everybody just screams fuck.
[2989.27s -> 2994.22s]  When are you going to do a cigarette smoking stream?
[2995.42s -> 3006.09s]  What? I just said they're in smoke? What the fuck would the point of that be?
[3006.89s -> 3022.86s]  I didn't even know you... There's no reason why he would smoke on stream. Let alone smoke
[3023.74s -> 3033.86s]  in real life. Another carload of people.
[3034.82s -> 3044.42s]  I'm going to smoke every brand of cigarettes and let us know what the best one is.
[3045.30s -> 3061.13s]  A guy that's never smoked cigarettes before in his life. You want to do a cigarette smoking
[3061.13s -> 3067.58s]  first time impressions channel. Like guys, I'm not going to... This is not opening Breath of
[3067.58s -> 3074.68s]  the Wild for 10 minutes and then writing a review about it. That's not how this is going to work.
[3077.88s -> 3084.12s]  Because then I hope I will... I'll get addicted to smoking cigarettes. I don't want to smoke
[3084.12s -> 3108.30s]  cigarettes. That's gross. Do it. You got to be cool. No, sorry. The only thing I think is
[3108.30s -> 3113.99s]  fucking cool is a McDLT dance. Nothing else is cool. I'm sorry. You're wrong.
[3116.98s -> 3129.35s]  Okay, boomer. Wouldn't the boomer be the one that had the cigarette in his mouth right now?
[3130.87s -> 3145.40s]  Me having a don't smoke stance. Guys, you would know I was a boomer if I would be smoking in my
[3145.40s -> 3159.02s]  house right now. Like cigarettes in the house. Not like, oh no, I'm going to step outside. No,
[3159.02s -> 3168.92s]  no, no. I smoke in my office. There's no face game to prove that you aren't smoking. I'm not.
[3171.26s -> 3185.32s]  Wait until he stands up. Make it embarrassing. I missed a lot of money.
[3186.92s -> 3195.77s]  Can I go over here? Is there the... Look at those chests. Do I eventually get up there?
[3196.65s -> 3208.62s]  I don't want to miss the chests. Oh, I think I wrap around in them.
[3219.78s -> 3233.64s]  All right, here we go. Over this way.
[3241.98s -> 3271.45s]  I'm wearing heels. Stupid. Okay, where are those... I got to go pick up all the junk over here.
[3276.94s -> 3295.16s]  Just on top? Where are these two? Where are these two? Oh. What are you going to do about it?
[3298.68s -> 3304.12s]  This guy's freaking me the fuck out. I'm just going to go. Wait, no, I got to go down every hall.
[3304.12s -> 3315.24s]  Oh, this is going to be a pain in the ass, but I have to do it. There's money in me.
[3315.24s -> 3327.58s]  Can't tell if that's faster or slower. It's probably slower. Charge is a... Charge is...
[3328.38s -> 3339.64s]  Oh, fuck. That's awesome. Thank God you told me that. Cash. Good.
[3341.88s -> 3351.70s]  Who snitched? That makes all of our lives easier because I don't sit here for more than like
[3353.16s -> 3361.24s]  more time than I need to. What do you mean who snitched? Can I get there from here?
[3373.93s -> 3377.96s]  Please don't have to kill those guys. Do I have to kill those guys?
[3378.44s -> 3389.40s]  Yeah, I got to kill those two guys that were standing. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do.
[3392.15s -> 3396.95s]  Don't smoke. Stop. Why would you smoke? Why smoke? Don't do that. What are you talking about? Don't
[3396.95s -> 3430.89s]  smoke. Oh, I can go. You smoked CBD oil. No, I didn't. Sorry. The proper use is a tincture.
[3430.89s -> 3451.88s]  A tincture? Tincture? Okay, this is where we go. It's getting so bad. Did anybody play this
[3452.84s -> 3470.02s]  when they were in the middle of making it? Wait, now I'm back. No, go over here.
[3475.66s -> 3482.17s]  Now I'm turned around. Wait, what? Is this the right way? It's all the same fucking car.
[3491.70s -> 3509.13s]  Oh my goodness gracious. This is the reason why Legend of Zelda never had a fucking jump.
[3509.85s -> 3522.58s]  It would be this awful. Dude, let me walk across the board. It's this camera.
[3524.89s -> 3550.38s]  Stuff changing. Holy shit. I can't do an attack because I'll fall off the fucking roof.
[3553.43s -> 3569.03s]  Shinobi levels are low key awful. I mean high key. Like, sing it as high to pitch as you can.
[3569.03s -> 3576.23s]  Like, see, like, I'm just trying to walk fucking straight. Like, what the fuck?
[3586.84s -> 3604.18s]  Where's the stupid trucker I can get up? Oh my fucking god. Like, this is like,
[3604.18s -> 3612.87s]  high pitch break the windows high key awful. Not low key. Low key would be, no, this is like,
[3615.35s -> 3641.10s]  where the fuck am I going? Why did I go this far? I can't wait till I get the jump deleted
[3641.10s -> 3646.44s]  from the game. That happens like immediately after this is over, right? And we never have to
[3646.44s -> 3653.48s]  do this again. Like, I mean like instantly. We don't get a jump, right? Ever again?
[3663.80s -> 3680.25s]  Okay, let's walk across the bridge. Okay, please. Don't like shift the camera.
[3706.94s -> 3728.98s]  Don't go off the edge. I'll be so mad. Don't, Jesus. Turn another bridge.
[3728.98s -> 3738.76s]  Don't fucking fall off. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's, it is, it is
[3740.28s -> 3758.41s]  fucking bearable. Holy shit. Oh my god. Can I jump up from here? Where do I go this way, right?
[3759.13s -> 3776.14s]  Is it over here? Where the hell is it? I'm on those. It's right fucking here.
[3777.38s -> 3806.44s]  Ugh. How do I forget? I'm not forget, I'm just insanely angry. Holy shit. You've got to be
[3806.44s -> 3827.05s]  fucking kidding me. This is harder than crouch jumping in the fucking source engine. Dude,
[3828.09s -> 3854.68s]  this has been, what a fucking journey to cross, to cross a bridge. Okay. I can't turn the camera
[3855.40s -> 3860.36s]  and even in the tiniest little movements make you fucking go frantic in this game.
[3861.32s -> 3865.64s]  Like, what the fuck are you doing? They're deliberately trying to make me fall.
[3866.28s -> 3887.78s]  Bakitu, get on it. What are you doing? Don't even go over there.
[3890.52s -> 3900.55s]  Can we fucking fight somewhere else? Because I see edge. I don't want to fight on the edge.
[3901.75s -> 3932.17s]  The edge is guaranteed to fall off the fucking edge. Don't move. Hit that chest. Wait, is that
[3932.17s -> 3939.62s]  bridge over here? No, no, no, no. Don't do this again. I got to just jump over here.
[3955.59s -> 3968.65s]  I almost didn't make it. I almost didn't make it. Oh my god. I don't want to be facing like this.
[3968.65s -> 3978.23s]  It's going to happen. I'm going to be so slow. You have no idea. Let's hug the fucking wall.
[3978.79s -> 4005.08s]  Hey, we're good. Holy shit, that sucked. Suda. What the hell was that? Suda. Suda wasn't in on
[4006.04s -> 4026.20s]  the Rectus one. Oh, so this is the Dark Souls 2 of the franchise. Oh, well, that's all right.
[4026.20s -> 4034.17s]  It's still fun. I still like it. I just don't like this part. I don't like the jump. I don't like it.
[4034.17s -> 4043.00s]  Send it back. Send it back. Return it. Dark Souls 2 is good. I didn't say it was bad.
[4043.00s -> 4045.96s]  I just said it was the Dark Souls 2 of the game.
[4046.52s -> 4056.81s]  The Dark Souls 2 also was not made by the same director, right? He kind of took a little hands
[4056.81s -> 4066.22s]  off approach, right? What do I remember? Why does he hate this? Am I supposed to be doing this right
[4066.22s -> 4085.06s]  now? I'd love to look down. Press the C button. Yeah, that just spins the camera. Yeah, if I was
[4085.06s -> 4089.70s]  doing that on the bridge, that'd be bad. It would rip the camera. Then I would walk the wrong direction
[4089.70s -> 4107.67s]  for a tenth of a second to fall off the bridge. Another one here? There's probably another one
[4107.67s -> 4121.14s]  right here somewhere. Wait, is this a truck stop bathroom? Why does it look like this?
[4121.86s -> 4152.01s]  It's like the nicest random warehouse bathroom ever. All right, let's go. Why doesn't she shit?
[4154.89s -> 4166.15s]  I don't know. Why do you want that to happen? Why do you want anybody to shit on a camera?
[4166.39s -> 4175.37s]  What do we have here? A young lady? You know, it's dangerous coming to a place like this alone.
[4176.31s -> 4181.91s]  You ought to be more careful. Seriously. Terrible things can happen. I see it on the news all the time.
[4185.00s -> 4191.72s]  Maybe that's why she came. It's what she wants. Two grown men to keep her company.
[4194.12s -> 4200.12s]  Horny slut. My master's got his hands full, so I'm taking his place. Not that it matters.
[4200.12s -> 4205.00s]  The results are going to be the same. I don't have time for this. You're taking Travis's place?
[4205.96s -> 4211.18s]  Wow. I got to say, I'm feeling pretty disrespected. Just shut up and fight. Listen to this
[4211.18s -> 4217.34s]  whore. Acting like she's some kind of femme fatale. Shut up and fight, she says. She's really
[4217.34s -> 4223.34s]  kissing me off. Seriously. And she's so rude. Reminds me of my complaining customers. Now,
[4223.34s -> 4229.58s]  Travis, he knew how to fight like a gentleman. Slice me in half, sure, but he did it with grace.
[4230.38s -> 4237.59s]  Come on. Put her there. Don't do it. You know, let's shake hands. Sportsmanship is paramount
[4237.59s -> 4248.15s]  to a fair and clean fight. Hurry up and shake. Dirty nympho. Whatever. But which one? It doesn't
[4248.15s -> 4259.90s]  matter. Your choice. The one that's throbbing. I kick, I kick, I kick. Destroy Spark. What the?
[4260.86s -> 4263.74s]  What? Was this supposed to spark?
[4267.58s -> 4270.62s]  I really have to fight two at the same time. This is going to be terrible.
[4273.42s -> 4281.83s]  Enough with your freak show. Now bring it. Oh, boy. And his jumping involved. Oh,
[4281.83s -> 4299.90s]  he's already mad about it. Your scoot is dead. Watch it. Watch it. Don't get greedy. Watch out.
[4299.90s -> 4310.46s]  What are you doing? Where's the other one? The other one. What's that thing? What's it floating?
[4314.02s -> 4319.46s]  I'm just going to focus on one.
[4331.82s -> 4346.46s]  Get me out. Destroy Spark. Go hide him. All right, go get the other one.
[4348.54s -> 4357.05s]  No, fight this one, I guess. The other guy's just raining hell on me.
[4365.03s -> 4367.83s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Oh, headshot.
[4370.63s -> 4384.84s]  Take it. All right, he's about halfway. I got to get out of this corner before I get killed.
[4390.87s -> 4410.86s]  Where's the health? There's a health box somewhere. Spark. Watch out. Where is it?
[4414.62s -> 4435.70s]  Leave me alone. I need health. Where is it? There's a box. Where is the box?
[4440.34s -> 4462.98s]  Where'd he go? What? The other guy can't hit me. Oh, that's unfair. He didn't even do it.
[4463.86s -> 4490.78s]  Hey, come on. What's with the fucking turn? All right, watch it. Watch. He's going to do moves.
[4491.82s -> 4526.34s]  Destroy Spark. Do it. Whoa. Where did he get me? Spin, spin, spin, spin. I'm doing it. What's
[4526.34s -> 4536.28s]  happening? He was shooting at me. I have no idea what happened. I guess I was behind the cardboard
[4536.28s -> 4575.66s]  boxes. All right, get back over here. I'll block that. Get behind the boxes. What are you doing?
[4576.38s -> 4604.65s]  Dude, it's making me fucking mad. It's making me mad. He's dead. Only one more asshole and I win.
[4636.79s -> 4651.54s]  Fuck. What's he doing? Hey, what is this? Did you just revive him? Wait a second.
[4655.43s -> 4664.98s]  They both have to die at the same time. Are you kidding me? They have to die at the same time,
[4665.70s -> 4697.91s]  but now I have to. That's so unfortunate. There's health up here. If only I could get it.
[4708.78s -> 4710.86s]  I'm not going to make it to the pizza.
[4710.86s -> 4734.78s]  No. Do I got anyone left in me? No. Oh, goodness. Okay. Well, I don't, I have to,
[4734.78s -> 4768.65s]  they both have to die within like the same time. Soybeans? That's not what he's saying.
[4769.61s -> 4803.78s]  That's what you deserve. You deserve that. Stop it. That was a wave. He dodged backwards.
[4804.82s -> 4829.10s]  I'm trying to get you to stay in the way of all his attacks. All right, hit him right in the fucking
[4829.10s -> 4846.89s]  head. What? You're just doing destroy beams the whole time. Get that shit. Get that smash
[4846.89s -> 4853.66s]  from this bullshit tactic out of here. Playing in a Hyrule castle. This fucking person playing
[4853.90s -> 4858.22s]  Samus just sits there and presses standard B across the map. Let him play the game.
[4859.18s -> 4895.88s]  You refresh Twitter more than you've played. Don't let him do it. Can I interrupt this?
[4895.88s -> 4898.20s]  Oh my God. Oh my God. I don't think I can. Can I interrupt it?
[4910.12s -> 4916.47s]  I need the health. I need health one. You seriously just spin around and hit me with that?
[4917.43s -> 4931.24s]  That's next level homing missile dude. Come on. Oh, come on.
[4940.76s -> 4944.36s]  I can't even get the fuck out of here. I'm going to die from this.
[4945.08s -> 4965.53s]  All right. Where's the, where's it? I don't even think about it. You fucking asshole.
[4965.53s -> 4998.17s]  All right. Oh my God. Is it safe back here? Is it safe right here? Hey,
[4998.97s -> 5019.02s]  holy shit. It hit him. It hit him. It hit this guy. All right. Kill this guy and then spawn camp his
[5019.02s -> 5038.20s]  body. Don't let him do it. All right. What are you going to do? Are you going to land?
[5039.69s -> 5052.38s]  I don't think so. Motherfucker. Hey, get out of here. You're not going to revive this guy.
[5053.10s -> 5072.41s]  No, you're not. I'm not going to let you do it. Not going to happen. What's that? Don't let him
[5072.41s -> 5082.25s]  revive him. No, no, don't do it. Please. No. That thing was homing for like 30 straight seconds.
[5082.97s -> 5089.22s]  You need more practice. How long can you have a device follow you the fuck around?
[5089.22s -> 5108.07s]  I've got to kill them before they get this off. Dude, I don't know. What the
[5108.07s -> 5125.26s]  fuck is happening in this fight? Holy shit. I'm going to fucking cry. This is horrible.
[5126.46s -> 5139.22s]  All right. Come here. You shoot a fucking homing bomb out. Why? Why does it take you so long to
[5139.30s -> 5144.98s]  finish that animation? Oh my God. I'm almost done with it. I'm almost done with it.
[5146.02s -> 5168.15s]  I'm almost done with it. He's directing the third one, right? Are we certain of that? Do we know
[5168.15s -> 5196.38s]  that? Do we know that for sure? Are we certain? God, I hope so. What is he doing? This guy's freaking
[5196.38s -> 5217.08s]  me the fuck out. Hey. I'm going to go up there to try to fight him. He's going to come revive
[5217.08s -> 5225.90s]  this motherfucker and I'm going to scream. Here he comes. That's my chance. Get out of here.
[5226.78s -> 5235.08s]  Get out of here. Go ahead. Fly away. I do need that fucking help though.
[5248.68s -> 5262.95s]  Where is he? Get out of here. I'm just scaring him away. Okay. I have to make a move.
[5267.10s -> 5271.88s]  He wants me to make a move so bad to come down and do this. I got to make a move.
[5285.03s -> 5296.17s]  Fuck out of here. This is stupid. This is stupid. Okay. This is stupid. This is stupid.
[5319.96s -> 5342.30s]  Don't do this. Don't even think about it. Get out of here. Where is he? Go off.
[5347.45s -> 5352.89s]  This is going to take forever. This is going to take forever. I have to get in there and fight
[5352.89s -> 5381.83s]  him. I can't just do this. This is dumb. I have to fight him. Holy shit. You let me heal. What a
[5381.83s -> 5418.68s]  fucking asshole. Go get him. Okay. I'm ready for him too. He's going. He's going. Go, go, go, go.
[5418.68s -> 5431.21s]  Go. Here he comes. Let him come over here and do that again.
[5431.21s -> 5474.90s]  Get the fuck out of here. Get away. Get out. All right. Now we play safe. I'm not fucking around.
[5476.68s -> 5496.15s]  He's going to hit his head right in the pole. All right. We're good. I'm going to follow him
[5496.15s -> 5528.63s]  this time. Oh, he's going to get it. He's going to get it. Settle down. It's all right. Settle
[5528.63s -> 5558.44s]  down. Which way is he going? I'm going to get up this way. I don't want to. Now we kill him.
[5568.62s -> 5594.28s]  Go this way. One last shot. I win. I don't win. I don't want to ever do this again.
[5594.28s -> 5674.31s]  Okay. Holy shit. I can do a better one than that. What do you think? Should I go a little
[5674.31s -> 5688.65s]  bit more with the throat? No. There it is. I'm going to get demonetized for saying
[5688.73s -> 5701.93s]  MonkaS. Well, that's a MonkaS scenario. And that's how I took them out. Destroy Man came back.
[5702.81s -> 5709.05s]  Didn't see that coming. He was an annoying prick though. I'm glad he's dead again. I can kill more
[5709.05s -> 5727.53s]  fighters for you. Whatever my master wants. I'll give me the game back. Master. Pesky little cub.
[5728.47s -> 5744.23s]  You can't kill me. Eat this. Must be having a nightmare. Hey, over here. I can't. That's how
[5744.23s -> 5763.98s]  close you can get with VR helmets on. I'm sorry. You can really count on her. The rest should be
[5763.98s -> 5781.13s]  easy now that she has done her part. Yeah. Wait. Something wrong? Nah, it's nothing. I like that
[5781.13s -> 5800.68s]  cactus. The next sucker's all mine. Oh, I'm about to be done with it. Let's go, Gene.
[5817.08s -> 5831.05s]  Holy shit. That was 171 centimeters. That was insane. What the what? You're so good now.
[5831.85s -> 5854.95s]  That's got to do it. Close. Not punching anything. I'm not punching the cat. We're doing squats.
[5865.26s -> 5881.29s]  Big junkers. Junkers. Junkers. It's not even like that funny, but it is. It just is.
[5888.04s -> 5914.82s]  Big. Oh my God. That's funny. Old record beaten. All right. 14 pounds. Let's play.
[5915.62s -> 5932.81s]  That was close. Come here. Nice. That was a whole pound from a bro. Travis Touchin was literally
[5932.81s -> 5938.01s]  me. Like LOL. We both have the same bleak nihilistic outlook. It was deleted. Probably
[5938.01s -> 5969.00s]  rightfully so. Now we feed the finest quality cat food. 13.9 pounds. Good. Oh, this is the present.
[5969.08s -> 5989.67s]  The beam katana is how much that beam katana rose nasty. I don't have to spend any money on it.
[5989.67s -> 6009.35s]  Let's go see if we can speak in a money. It's been a while. We did like two or three missions
[6009.35s -> 6016.20s]  in a row. Let's go check out what we can do. You know what I mean? Like three pog moment here.
[6022.42s -> 6030.87s]  No, no more mini games. Well, I mean, how am I supposed to make money? I need money for the gym
[6030.87s -> 6042.95s]  and money for the lab. Look, I'm just going to do some... This is playing. This is how you make money.
[6087.61s -> 6099.38s]  I fucked it up. This is going to go like this. Wait, where does this go?
[6102.42s -> 6140.66s]  No, don't go like that. I ain't about to sit there. CVD brain. Don't feel bad, son. You're
[6140.66s -> 6163.96s]  just bad at the game. I'm definitely older than you. I say, son. That was your fucking dad. What
[6163.96s -> 6187.61s]  the fuck? What's this? Sorry, dad. Why did I not go in? Soy cigarette brain. You guys come up with
[6187.61s -> 6205.06s]  just new terms every day. What's he today? I don't know. He's a Jolly Rancher horse manure
[6206.10s -> 6224.81s]  screamer. I'm glad I see. I see one true in there and it makes me fucking happy.
[6245.37s -> 6257.62s]  It is true though. Jolly Rancher Reddit brain.
[6257.62s -> 6292.50s]  I did that one pretty cleanly. I didn't get hit by any of the meatballs. Made air. I guess you
[6292.50s -> 6296.10s]  could bring them all up here and just let them go, but I don't know if I want to do that.
[6298.86s -> 6323.19s]  No, I'll try it. I don't even want to give this attention, but no, I'm not even going to.
[6326.33s -> 6343.70s]  What the fuck? Let me out. What was it? I don't know. Maybe you'll figure it out.
[6344.74s -> 6363.91s]  It was just a dumb comment. How much money is that? Let's see if I can do it. 28,000. All right.
[6364.47s -> 6395.53s]  Let's go see if we can upgrade. What do you got? Man with dumb comment. You have nothing?
[6396.25s -> 6407.02s]  Do you ever have anything else? Two items so far the whole game? Not even like parts or anything?
[6414.39s -> 6435.66s]  It was just one $300,000 purchase there. That's it. This one's going to be really hard.
[6435.66s -> 6444.44s]  This is going to be the second hardest. It's $10,000. I don't want to blow this.
[6497.48s -> 6551.38s]  Dude, the game can't even register you pressing it like that. I better have done it. Wait, I can
[6551.38s -> 6574.31s]  do a no. Oh no. Back to back. This one's $12,000. Oh, I didn't know that. He has a spam now.
[6575.27s -> 6615.74s]  Good enough, right? Come on. Yes. This one more isn't there. Good. Okay. Tell that Wendy's story.
[6615.74s -> 6621.14s]  One time I went to Wendy's and I got a fucking big chicken. It was good. The story's over. I
[6621.14s -> 6651.56s]  don't have any Wendy's story. Tell us the story. Tell us that story. That was a quick change. Come
[6651.56s -> 6668.94s]  on. Don't do that to me. That means it'd be another one for this, right? I'm almost a max. Oh yeah.
[6668.94s -> 6680.95s]  There's only is one more level of this. Both of them. At least I spent all my money.
[6681.99s -> 6689.54s]  Okay. Here we go. This one's not hard. It's probably going to get real hard soon here.
[6690.50s -> 6717.82s]  Whoa. Faster. Don't accidentally run off. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6717.82s -> 6728.42s]  Describe day one with Otto. It was a wonderful thing. Picked him up. He was sitting in my lap.
[6729.06s -> 6741.02s]  He put his head in my armpit and it was the cutest thing ever. He just stuffed his head in my armpit.
[6741.66s -> 6748.14s]  He was hiding. It was like safe for him. You know, it was so cute. Like, oh, okay. You can do that.
[6748.94s -> 6784.25s]  Okay. What about clothes? This is one of our new jacket. Nerd. How is this? Is it pens?
[6784.89s -> 6804.49s]  I'll take it. Okay. There's a nerd pants. Wait, why is this nerd? Do they have knee pads?
[6806.01s -> 6836.76s]  I need more money. I'll be back. Yeah. I'm going to do the other missions.
[6836.76s -> 6839.32s]  Elbow pads too. He's being protected. That's fine.
[6839.80s -> 6863.67s]  Kill all enemies within the time limit. This is not the new Sabre though. What's the new Sabre?
[6870.39s -> 6889.58s]  Dual Welding. It's a dual welder. Okay. Let's go. Pretty cool. Bam. This corner.
[6890.38s -> 6900.66s]  It's aggro everyone. Later. I'm going to be able to do the movement. I'm going to cut all their heads
[6900.66s -> 6937.34s]  up. Somebody's health go to zero? No, zero. Peony back out.
[6941.08s -> 6950.47s]  The range of this is too small. Let's take out, let's take out a real Sabre.
[6964.90s -> 6967.54s]  Maybe I shouldn't have aggroed every enemy.
[6975.96s -> 6981.32s]  Why these guys have so much health? He's just default enemies. Holy shit.
[6982.84s -> 7010.30s]  Bring it on. I'm going to need that health.
[7022.81s -> 7027.21s]  Who has the guns? Who's just spamming? Who has the spam?
[7033.11s -> 7055.58s]  Hopefully I do this in the time limit. I have 14 seconds to kill three people.
[7056.30s -> 7081.90s]  This is the last person. What? It was the final person. I was trying to target something.
[7082.62s -> 7100.14s]  There's nothing there. It was you. Okay. Well this time I'm going to use the actual weapon
[7100.14s -> 7111.45s]  I should be using. This is the good one. Three, two, one, zero. Hi.
[7111.45s -> 7168.60s]  It's too violent. Sorry.
[7173.03s -> 7174.95s]  What's the range? It's the best item in the whole game.
[7175.67s -> 7182.18s]  It's just, I saved up. That's what we did all scream yesterday. It was me doing minigames
[7182.18s -> 7215.88s]  to make $300,000. So we did yesterday. We went for a spawn or? Oh 15. Use Rose Nasty on the boss.
[7216.76s -> 7222.42s]  Yeah, I'll use it. Just for something like this. You got to kill them quick.
[7222.42s -> 7245.78s]  How much was that for? Rose Nasty does a lot of stagger, especially if you dark step.
[7245.86s -> 7249.64s]  I'll give it a try. I'm going to use it. I'm going to put it on.
[7250.36s -> 7273.86s]  The East had a brute strength or deadly weapons or gimmicks. It subdues all enemies with the
[7273.86s -> 7282.57s]  sheer force of its will. And fighters who wield this clash, the battle is epic. They see it in
[7282.57s -> 7291.00s]  each other and form it becomes test of their souls. Yeah, it's fine. Maybe someday we'll be
[7291.00s -> 7324.97s]  the spectators of such a battle. All right. Can I, uh, there's a motorcycle fight.
[7325.69s -> 7342.87s]  This, I, I'm going to, I want the whole nerd outfit. We actually are on the motorcycles.
[7343.43s -> 7349.51s]  No, we're not. Wait. Yes, we are. Accelerate. Brake. Nitro. Steer.
[7362.14s -> 7373.32s]  How far was this gulch? So far. Holy shit. You can see the water. They weren't this high up.
[7375.06s -> 7384.71s]  Let's do this. Of course. The obvious fall joke. That's going to happen.
[7384.71s -> 7393.32s]  Unironically, a thousand times. What are we supposed to be doing? Is this a race?
[7405.78s -> 7410.22s]  Wait, this is smart. It's Mario party. It's a Mario party game where you're going to be
[7410.22s -> 7413.98s]  Yoshi. You got to like bump into people until they fall off. Right. All right. I'm ready.
[7415.18s -> 7431.38s]  What? The trigger, the event is close. I'm going to fucking watch this. He's going to
[7431.38s -> 7439.51s]  go right off the edge. It's going to be perfect. Let's go. Ready? Oh yeah. I was the best at Mario
[7439.51s -> 7462.44s]  party. Okay. Follow me. Let's do this. What's wrong? I did the nitrous mixes. You can't turn
[7462.44s -> 7473.48s]  very well. It's not funny. You're right. That's not funny. It's not. Look at how huge of a turn
[7473.48s -> 7510.86s]  that is. Did I get him? Okay. Here we go. Almost. Hold on. Let's do this. You're making this fight
[7510.86s -> 7562.30s]  so lame. Back the fucking car up, dude. He's got a fucking wall. That's not fair. Wait.
[7563.58s -> 7577.93s]  Hey, that turn. What the fuck? They've made this in dreams.
[7581.30s -> 7590.55s]  You don't drift with a back tire and then fly forward. I'm going right in. Let me just go.
[7591.35s -> 7603.98s]  And then get him to turn this way. Oh, come on. I just road-runnered him and it didn't work.
[7604.78s -> 7626.52s]  Try to leave? Can you? Can I? Okay. Can I leave? Can I? Nope. I can't.
[7627.08s -> 7666.01s]  It's payback time. Okay.
[7701.48s -> 7719.72s]  You're not getting trouble from that. He's invulnerable. Don't drive off.
[7720.36s -> 7740.28s]  That's what I'm talking about. Back in the action. It feels like it should be at times two speed.
[7740.36s -> 7747.83s]  That's seven times. Let's get minus two. I'm not.
[7760.82s -> 7768.70s]  I'm using Nitro. I'm holding Z. Let's do this. Veto this game. No, I can't. No.
[7769.34s -> 7798.82s]  I can hit him when he's revving. No, I can't. Watch. Hey. Turn. Turn. Turn all the way. Turn.
[7798.98s -> 7819.83s]  Oh, okay. Not even fair. Not even fair. I can't. It's payback time.
[7822.10s -> 7836.42s]  Okay. How many? I don't know. Nine. I have to gift sub-server. No, that doesn't work. Come on.
[7837.30s -> 7867.06s]  Hey. It hurts a lot. I can't even do this. Let's go. It's hard to control. I could give you every
[7867.06s -> 7872.58s]  excuse in the book. It's fucking weird, man. I don't know what's going on. Half this game is
[7872.58s -> 7879.48s]  just weird shit that they threw it for some reason. This is it. I'm going to get it right here. I just
[7879.48s -> 7922.74s]  won. Oh, actual phase is real fire. That's fine. That's a cool saber. If I die, do I have to restart
[7922.74s -> 7962.50s]  at the... You see? Oh, I dodged it too. That was so much greed. Not even funny. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.
[7962.50s -> 7989.86s]  Charge. I'm almost out of battery. All right. Battery time. How far does it go?
[7992.18s -> 8009.98s]  Time out. We got him. I should try to dark step that, shouldn't I? That would be sick if I did.
[8010.70s -> 8061.78s]  Nope. Whoa. Do I run from that? It's still out. Shit. She's low. Oh, fuck. Here comes that snake
[8061.78s -> 8083.03s]  thing. He's just out of reach. Give me this weapon. Give me this thing. Thanks for letting me close.
[8085.29s -> 8122.95s]  I don't understand how dark step works. Jesus. Battery. Doing it twice in a row.
[8123.67s -> 8135.72s]  Damn it. Come on. Oh, my. You have to do this three times in a row. You mother fucker.
[8136.92s -> 8178.57s]  No. Bring back the peony. It's decisive. Look at the boxes. Just give me... Please pick it up.
[8195.51s -> 8201.10s]  Dude, I don't think the camera's been facing the right direction since like three days ago.
[8201.98s -> 8252.73s]  Do it. Easy. Don't stop. Stop. Stop. Come here. Oh, more. More. More. More. More. Give me more.
[8255.08s -> 8271.08s]  More. More. More. Oh, no. He's getting careless. Oh, shit. I'm getting so careless.
[8271.32s -> 8285.50s]  Damn it. Oh, I got so careless. This battery in this. Oh, god. This is bad.
[8299.32s -> 8308.10s]  Hey, we're good.
[8321.29s -> 8342.38s]  I win. I'm trying to skid. No more QTEs.
[8342.46s -> 8348.60s]  Oh, my.
[8361.90s -> 8370.07s]  Why you beat him? He had nothing left. I know that. Jesus. That was fucked up.
[8370.07s -> 8378.07s]  This is not some Pewee Karate tournament, Travis. You do not say bow and go home. You are an assassin.
[8378.07s -> 8384.07s]  And killing is how you win. But I thought what? He fought honorably so he'd work a little bit.
[8384.07s -> 8389.51s]  So he can come back stronger and cut you in half. You are developing a bad habit.
[8389.51s -> 8394.47s]  First, that dumb schoolgirl. Oh, yeah. I'm supposed to pee. Just finish the job,
[8394.47s -> 8411.05s]  or we will do it for you. These fights are not a sport. Shit. All right. It's pee time.
[8411.05s -> 8419.00s]  I'll be back in two minutes. Unless there's no cut scene. All right. I'll be back after you get
[8419.00s -> 8434.01s]  to see this part. I mean, this part. Start the clock. Yeah, that'll take me two minutes.
[8434.73s -> 8624.22s]  Get back. Flush first.
[8634.04s -> 8635.24s]  Is this guy still in the bed?
[8649.70s -> 8655.21s]  What the hell?
[8666.33s -> 8670.97s]  Your thoughts? Well, you gave them to me. That doesn't make any sense.
[8671.61s -> 8679.74s]  I was hoping you'd wander around some more. Explore. Yes, you. You did not want to go back.
[8679.74s -> 8684.62s]  So you reached out to my consciousness instead. Now we are one. Let's go.
[8684.62s -> 8691.90s]  Got you fourth. Away with you. I said be gone. You should stay here forever. No way.
[8692.62s -> 8702.81s]  We live together. I'll never leave. I'm going back. If you want to go, no choice.
[8702.81s -> 8707.29s]  Why don't you come with me? You like it. I have a weapon. I know you're trying to trick me.
[8708.33s -> 8725.30s]  Congrats, Jerma. You now have to fight Ayaya. Oh, yeah. He's got the Kylo Ren saber.
[8726.82s -> 8730.26s]  Attack. Dash. Hold A, then release for long range.
[8735.69s -> 8739.45s]  This is the Bloodborne character? That's a dash. I like it already.
[8740.73s -> 8753.62s]  If you don't... Oh, beam. Oh, I missed.
[8760.01s -> 8777.43s]  Whoa, I can't even... Where's the beam? I just got... Oh, I got slapped. Oh, come on.
[8779.67s -> 8819.98s]  Is there health in a dream? Get in there and slash. What happened? What, I have like a magician ball?
[8820.78s -> 8869.83s]  Wait, how many... Whoa, this move is good. He's Sony. I'm probably just scared so much.
[8872.28s -> 8877.08s]  That was like you just dropped food on the ground and like an animal went to go get it.
[8877.08s -> 8906.98s]  Like, no, no, no, hey, hey. Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop. No, I'm not. What am I chewing?
[8909.05s -> 8914.74s]  I'm not chewing anything. I'm getting way too greedy with this bullshit.
[8915.46s -> 8932.47s]  Go back to the tried and true arcade missile. Okay, now we have to fight. No, we don't.
[8932.47s -> 8965.08s]  All right, going for the kill. Don't chew tobacco. That was not a...
[8966.68s -> 8982.78s]  That was like a knight. Oh, that was a knight. That was very clearly a...
[8985.50s -> 8988.62s]  Like, I'm a knight and I have a big suit of armor on.
[8988.62s -> 8991.66s]  A tournament. That was not what you think it is.
[9003.62s -> 9007.94s]  Are you the one who rescued me? I had a fight to win. You were just collateral damage.
[9007.94s -> 9010.50s]  Watching the video. So get out when you can manage it.
[9012.31s -> 9015.03s]  Until then, I've got some good shit on video.
[9018.46s -> 9032.07s]  We'll see about that. I'm watching.
[9032.95s -> 9054.55s]  Close my door. I'm watching anime. That's when your mom walks in.
[9054.55s -> 9058.39s]  Forgive your big brother who's too much of a shitebag to thank you face to face.
[9059.03s -> 9062.07s]  You're the big brother? How do you know I didn't pop out first?
[9063.83s -> 9068.79s]  And the point is, there's no honor in getting rescued by my younger, big brother.
[9068.79s -> 9074.87s]  So I took it upon myself to proper kill Scott Gardner, Greg Cantrell, and Massimo Bellini.
[9075.51s -> 9079.83s]  You've gotta be kidding me. Would you fucking people stop stealing my kills?
[9079.83s -> 9084.95s]  This makes us even. As far as the rescue goes, you and I still have a score to box off.
[9084.95s -> 9086.47s]  That's another subject entirely.
[9087.11s -> 9088.31s]  K-K-S-ing.
[9092.81s -> 9097.37s]  Damn it. Irish ass. He could at least have told me more about those assassins.
[9097.37s -> 9101.21s]  And in case you were wondering, I took pictures of the three skankers as souvenirs.
[9101.21s -> 9102.65s]  How long is this message?
[9103.53s -> 9107.69s]  I feel like I could do it. When I do an accent like this, you guys scream at me.
[9109.29s -> 9110.98s]  Please come out and I'll sleep.
[9112.82s -> 9115.06s]  I'd probably make good wallpaper for you.
[9115.86s -> 9119.24s]  I'm fine. Well, I've got a lot of things to say. I'll hang up now.
[9119.80s -> 9120.68s]  Long message, isn't it?
[9121.24s -> 9122.36s]  Good boy.
[9129.40s -> 9130.28s]  You're Irish, though.
[9131.86s -> 9133.22s]  Um, gotcha.
[9133.22s -> 9140.38s]  Why would I speak with an Irish accent if my ancestors are from Ireland?
[9141.90s -> 9142.70s]  I'm not from there.
[9149.18s -> 9152.57s]  I was born, like, what?
[9153.21s -> 9157.43s]  Dude, this dude's Irish. He can't even do a fucking Irish accent.
[9158.31s -> 9160.07s]  Ha ha, is that even possible?
[9169.74s -> 9170.62s]  Freddie Dredd.
[9170.62s -> 9172.14s]  Freddie Dredd saved $200.
[9173.18s -> 9174.94s]  When did you do this? Like two minutes ago?
[9176.20s -> 9177.08s]  Holy shit.
[9178.22s -> 9180.62s]  That's $220,000 of this.
[9180.62s -> 9183.26s]  That's $200 bucks, Freddie.
[9184.06s -> 9188.97s]  Freddie, you showered me with money.
[9189.77s -> 9191.40s]  It's a lot. Thank you, dude.
[9193.46s -> 9195.54s]  And they say it was a very clear night.
[9195.54s -> 9196.82s]  Uh-huh. See? Thank you.
[9197.70s -> 9201.30s]  Just like how every time I go, ay-yai-yai.
[9202.18s -> 9203.94s]  Or like, ay-yai-yai-yai.
[9203.94s -> 9206.18s]  It's not like, oh, he's doing that thing. I hate him.
[9206.18s -> 9206.68s]  Burn him.
[9207.62s -> 9208.12s]  Punch him.
[9211.78s -> 9214.50s]  I go like, ay-yai-yai.
[9215.22s -> 9220.54s]  I don't have any money.
[9222.42s -> 9225.99s]  But Freddie, thanks for the ridiculous amount of money.
[9230.39s -> 9231.99s]  Cat, cat. I don't have any money for the cat either.
[9231.99s -> 9232.87s]  I need to do side jobs.
[9233.51s -> 9235.00s]  Which one is it going to be?
[9235.64s -> 9239.91s]  And which one do I want to do?
[9240.63s -> 9245.58s]  Coconut Grabber.
[9246.14s -> 9256.57s]  Don't play the minigames?
[9258.34s -> 9260.02s]  I'm not playing the minigames for fun.
[9260.02s -> 9263.06s]  I'm playing the minigames because I want to make money.
[9263.78s -> 9266.94s]  I'm not just, like, going to the arcade.
[9272.34s -> 9273.62s]  I thought about having fun right now.
[9273.62s -> 9275.06s]  It's about how much money can I make?
[9277.70s -> 9280.50s]  And look, the dollar signs are going up.
[9283.59s -> 9284.09s]  Four.
[9295.82s -> 9298.98s]  Oh, I didn't save it.
[9305.50s -> 9306.78s]  Oh, you motherfucker.
[9306.78s -> 9322.09s]  My fucking finger slipped.
[9322.73s -> 9323.53s]  It still worked.
[9324.33s -> 9338.20s]  Let's catch it.
[9338.20s -> 9339.32s]  And this one's going to explode.
[9351.48s -> 9352.12s]  I like this one, though.
[9352.12s -> 9352.68s]  This one's fun.
[9354.25s -> 9354.75s]  Really?
[9368.55s -> 9369.05s]  Got it!
[9369.11s -> 9380.22s]  How much time?
[9387.06s -> 9387.56s]  Pow.
[9391.67s -> 9392.17s]  Pow!
[9392.31s -> 9402.74s]  I'm trying to get...
[9402.74s -> 9409.53s]  I got 20,000.
[9409.53s -> 9415.14s]  I want to see the speedrun for this shit.
[9415.14s -> 9416.66s]  It's probably so ridiculous.
[9417.70s -> 9421.88s]  That didn't go in.
[9421.88s -> 9426.01s]  Come on.
[9429.53s -> 9430.81s]  Get in the basket.
[9434.58s -> 9434.98s]  I got it.
[9434.98s -> 9435.48s]  Okay.
[9435.86s -> 9437.14s]  The scorpion was freaking me out.
[9437.94s -> 9453.02s]  Faster.
[9469.29s -> 9469.93s]  Damn it!
[9469.93s -> 9471.53s]  I can't do it.
[9471.53s -> 9472.73s]  I tried to get it.
[9472.73s -> 9478.62s]  It's redeemed the German Wink.
[9478.62s -> 9479.18s]  Oh, shit.
[9479.18s -> 9480.86s]  They're almost at 15.
[9480.86s -> 9481.58s]  What do I do?
[9482.54s -> 9485.80s]  One more bullet.
[9491.53s -> 9492.41s]  They got it.
[9492.41s -> 9493.05s]  They got it.
[9497.66s -> 9499.02s]  15 out of 15.
[9499.02s -> 9499.82s]  Are you kidding me?
[9503.93s -> 9505.29s]  Oh, man.
[9505.29s -> 9505.79s]  Okay.
[9506.75s -> 9508.49s]  I didn't think you guys are going to do that.
[9510.24s -> 9511.20s]  You surprise me every day.
[9512.08s -> 9522.84s]  I've got to give you your reward.
[9528.44s -> 9529.08s]  See that shit?
[9546.17s -> 9546.97s]  And go.
[9554.51s -> 9555.07s]  Oh.
[9555.07s -> 9557.29s]  Out of my way.
[9563.39s -> 9563.89s]  Nice.
[9564.51s -> 9565.04s]  All right.
[9565.04s -> 9566.16s]  What did you guys want me to wink?
[9566.16s -> 9567.76s]  Oh, my webcam's not plugged in.
[9570.99s -> 9571.79s]  It's not plugged in.
[9571.79s -> 9572.67s]  And if I plug it in,
[9573.47s -> 9575.23s]  it might break the computer.
[9576.27s -> 9577.47s]  That sounds like a lie.
[9577.47s -> 9577.95s]  I know.
[9577.95s -> 9580.19s]  I know that sounds like the worst lie you've ever heard in your life.
[9580.83s -> 9581.71s]  If I can assure you,
[9582.67s -> 9584.43s]  if I will break my computer,
[9584.43s -> 9585.63s]  if I plug this in,
[9586.27s -> 9592.97s]  send a picture to us.
[9592.97s -> 9593.77s]  I could do that.
[9594.33s -> 9595.29s]  I think I might be able to do that.
[9599.66s -> 9603.08s]  I got to get this.
[9603.08s -> 9604.44s]  This is $14,000.
[9604.44s -> 9605.24s]  I got to get this right.
[9605.24s -> 9606.52s]  This is the hard one.
[9606.52s -> 9607.96s]  The hardest one in the game.
[9632.59s -> 9644.76s]  Got to be it.
[9644.76s -> 9645.40s]  It's got to be it.
[9645.40s -> 9646.28s]  That's got to be it.
[9646.28s -> 9649.15s]  Don't ever doubt me ever again.
[9649.15s -> 9661.47s]  That's the last attack power upgrade.
[9661.47s -> 9664.84s]  And then we've got the final stamina upgrade.
[9672.11s -> 9672.75s]  Wink.
[9672.75s -> 9673.25s]  Hold on.
[9679.07s -> 9680.75s]  You know, I'm going to be here for another couple hours.
[9680.75s -> 9681.31s]  You know that, right?
[9681.31s -> 9681.71s]  At least.
[9682.67s -> 9683.90s]  I'll be here.
[9683.90s -> 9684.62s]  I can do it soon.
[9685.50s -> 9688.03s]  You know, I could do it on July 30th.
[9690.12s -> 9692.44s]  The next wink will be on July 30th, probably.
[9693.56s -> 9694.68s]  Kind of plan this stuff out.
[9695.40s -> 9709.53s]  Good job.
[9714.14s -> 9715.42s]  Time for the mission to begin.
[9717.18s -> 9720.19s]  I did want to get the nerd pants, though, didn't I?
[9721.68s -> 9722.00s]  Cat.
[9722.00s -> 9722.56s]  Oh, yeah.
[9722.56s -> 9723.60s]  I'll get the cat.
[9723.60s -> 9733.55s]  What do you get for putting the cat back in shape?
[9744.59s -> 9745.47s]  A healthy cat.
[9746.81s -> 9747.31s]  Gene.
[9750.46s -> 9750.96s]  Good jump.
[9753.37s -> 9753.87s]  Let go.
[9754.33s -> 9765.02s]  I need a bigger one than that.
[9765.02s -> 9765.52s]  Gene.
[9768.08s -> 9768.40s]  Yeah.
[9768.40s -> 9769.20s]  That was a big one.
[9769.84s -> 9774.25s]  That's the biggest one so far.
[9780.28s -> 9781.08s]  0.4 pounds.
[9783.02s -> 9783.52s]  Stretch.
[9795.60s -> 9796.88s]  Enormous weight loss.
[9811.61s -> 9812.81s]  You're lifting with your back.
[9814.56s -> 9815.20s]  Looks like it.
[9816.16s -> 9819.76s]  And our big chunky.
[9821.12s -> 9821.84s]  12 pounds.
[9823.20s -> 9825.44s]  I'm going for record.
[9858.89s -> 9859.61s]  12 pounds.
[9862.67s -> 9871.02s]  The whistle sounds like someone's trying to stop me.
[9871.02s -> 9872.46s]  Like, get my attention.
[9876.01s -> 9877.37s]  Like I stepped out of bounds or something.
[9877.37s -> 9879.98s]  I'm like, come here.
[9882.68s -> 9884.36s]  There's a soccer ref back there.
[9884.36s -> 9885.48s]  Being like, that's a foul.
[9885.48s -> 9886.36s]  That's a foul.
[9886.36s -> 9887.00s]  That's a foul.
[9887.00s -> 9887.56s]  That's a foul.
[9887.56s -> 9888.20s]  That's a foul.
[9888.20s -> 9888.76s]  That's a foul.
[9888.76s -> 9890.84s]  You know, I don't have enough cards for this.
[9898.19s -> 9898.69s]  Premium.
[9899.39s -> 9903.98s]  All right.
[9903.98s -> 9905.26s]  11.6 pounds.
[9905.26s -> 9906.46s]  That's good, right?
[9907.42s -> 9912.09s]  I don't want the cat to be too thin.
[9922.96s -> 9925.92s]  Wait, I have to look at the shelf to learn these?
[9926.80s -> 9933.23s]  Belly to back waist.
[9933.23s -> 9942.65s]  Well, I got a lot of moves to learn.
[9944.00s -> 9944.96s]  Finally noticed.
[9954.30s -> 9956.06s]  Put the cat to negative 25.
[9957.26s -> 9958.54s]  I don't know if that makes any sense.
[9959.74s -> 9970.32s]  We got a whole game of moves here.
[9980.86s -> 9982.30s]  Damn, I really didn't do any of these.
[9983.02s -> 9988.22s]  Shown weight to the cat is extra weight that you need to remove,
[9988.22s -> 9989.58s]  not the weight of the actual cat.
[9992.40s -> 9992.64s]  What?
[9993.28s -> 9998.11s]  So you tell me this cat was supposed to be 40 pounds?
[9999.95s -> 10000.91s]  45 pounds?
[10001.71s -> 10005.13s]  I don't think that's true.
[10005.85s -> 10008.59s]  All right, let's save this.
[10008.59s -> 10016.97s]  You have to get the cat under 10 pounds.
[10017.69s -> 10022.84s]  Okay, do the mission.
[10022.84s -> 10035.29s]  8 to 10 pounds is average.
[10036.57s -> 10042.54s]  Cat should decide their lifestyle.
[10043.50s -> 10049.50s]  Rank four.
[10050.22s -> 10053.52s]  Herd pants?
[10053.52s -> 10055.04s]  I will after this mission.
[10055.04s -> 10062.36s]  Take a seat.
[10062.36s -> 10064.44s]  There's something I want to talk to you about.
[10065.47s -> 10066.43s]  Another rule change?
[10067.23s -> 10068.83s]  No, it's about Henry.
[10069.47s -> 10070.75s]  I want to clear the air.
[10071.31s -> 10071.63s]  Why?
[10072.96s -> 10074.48s]  We are divorced now, you know?
[10074.48s -> 10075.92s]  I don't remember Snake on those things.
[10076.56s -> 10078.08s]  I don't want to hear any of that shit.
[10079.12s -> 10082.32s]  The last time when you and Henry fought each other?
[10083.90s -> 10087.02s]  Snake was the only game that we could play on our old cell phones.
[10087.82s -> 10090.54s]  It was a huge deal who had the best Snake account.
[10113.15s -> 10113.55s]  Shoes.
[10117.63s -> 10117.87s]  Have.
[10120.40s -> 10121.12s]  So what?
[10121.84s -> 10123.28s]  You want revenge, right?
[10124.16s -> 10126.48s]  Your opponents could not care less about that.
[10130.17s -> 10134.41s]  Once I'm number one, these bullshit ranking fights are over.
[10134.41s -> 10134.81s]  Got it?
[10135.53s -> 10137.05s]  Assassins aren't tools.
[10137.05s -> 10138.73s]  As fucked up as we might be.
[10138.73s -> 10139.77s]  We're humans too.
[10148.76s -> 10150.20s]  Until No More Heroes 3.
[10154.57s -> 10155.53s]  Ranking battle.
[10156.25s -> 10161.05s]  It's time to go.
[10165.26s -> 10165.98s]  Need pants.
[10165.98s -> 10166.62s]  Need pants.
[10167.42s -> 10170.38s]  I don't deserve the nerd pants until I can be a nerd.
[10171.10s -> 10174.94s]  I can beat this without any problems and without any huffing and puffing.
[10176.30s -> 10177.18s]  What I mean by that is...
[10177.74s -> 10178.54s]  I don't even understand.
[10178.54s -> 10179.26s]  What is this?
[10180.06s -> 10180.62s]  What the fuck?
[10180.62s -> 10181.66s]  This is dumb.
[10181.66s -> 10182.78s]  This is stupid.
[10182.78s -> 10183.18s]  None of that.
[10183.82s -> 10184.78s]  No huffing and puffing.
[10186.52s -> 10187.64s]  I don't deserve the nerd pants.
[10187.72s -> 10188.28s]  Out of my way.
[10188.28s -> 10199.40s]  Get out of my way.
[10218.62s -> 10226.68s]  Coming out.
[10230.78s -> 10232.30s]  I wanna do a new wrestling move.

[13938.12s -> 13941.83s]  All right, anything else I can do

[15800.34s -> 15802.34s]  All toothpaste water-based toothpaste
[15829.77s -> 15831.77s]  Every time I see the word based based based on what
[15832.49s -> 15843.93s]  Why do you guys do that?
[15844.92s -> 15850.15s]  Do you swallow too much toothpaste? Well, the goal is not to swallow any toothpaste
[15853.96s -> 15855.96s]  How much toothpaste are you using
[15857.29s -> 15860.73s]  Imagine using half a tube of toothpaste every time you brush your teeth
[15862.89s -> 15877.45s]  How much toothpaste is in what is one serving?
[15878.41s -> 15880.57s]  Uh, it's a one pea-sized amount, right?
[15881.90s -> 15883.90s]  Do like a little a little dollop
[15887.50s -> 15890.64s]  That's not me trying to be funny that's actually supposed to use pea-sized
[15898.42s -> 15927.77s]  We're ready for the second rank battle now, this was a long one you're thinking of thermal paste
[15929.13s -> 15932.65s]  Do you chase your toothpaste?
[15934.58s -> 15936.66s]  um
[15936.66s -> 15939.43s]  I don't I spit it out
[15939.43s -> 15944.09s]  I hate using mouthwash. I really do
[15945.22s -> 15949.74s]  It sucks you put it in there and then you just want to get it out as soon as possible
[15952.57s -> 15955.69s]  Swish it around you're like I can take this it's not bad. It's been 10 seconds
[15955.69s -> 15956.41s]  I'm good
[15956.41s -> 15960.17s]  And then and then that's when it starts to really like your brain just starts to scream at you that it hurts
[15962.92s -> 15977.94s]  And then you just go now. I don't care spit it up. It hurts a good. It's not a good hurt
[15979.22s -> 15980.34s]  it's a

[15991.02s -> 15993.82s]  Yeah, that's me the no more hero
[15994.70s -> 15996.70s]  how unfortunate
[15996.70s -> 15999.98s]  Right when I am about to reach the top you have to find me
[16000.94s -> 16003.66s]  I was hoping we'd fight after I became number one
[16005.14s -> 16007.14s]  Sorry to crush your dreams
[16007.38s -> 16011.22s]  I hate to do it, but i've got business with that son of a bitch
[16011.86s -> 16013.86s]  And I can't let you get to him first
[16015.22s -> 16018.10s]  Please don't think of me as a nuisance
[16018.90s -> 16024.26s]  But I will make sure your victory isn't easy. It's me the no more heroes to desperate struggle
[16029.90s -> 16036.06s]  I've seen a lot in my journey up the ranks an endless cycle of violence now broadcast as a spectator
[16036.30s -> 16039.92s]  Everybody else get a shitload of anxiety when popcorn pops like this in the microwave
[16040.64s -> 16045.52s]  If we are all going to end up I feel like it's gonna explode every time does it really matter why
[16046.40s -> 16048.24s]  To me it does
[16048.24s -> 16050.24s]  It matters more than anything
[16050.94s -> 16052.94s]  We've all become trapped. Don't you see?
[16053.48s -> 16055.82s]  Addicted to the violence to a life in the shadows
[16056.62s -> 16058.94s]  Once we join the ranks we can never get out
[16059.74s -> 16063.26s]  Don't be stupid if you get tired of the battles just fucking quit
[16064.14s -> 16068.94s]  But that's why we all want to fight you to learn your secret. Don't you get it?
[16069.94s -> 16076.08s]  Three hundred thousand dollars at naomi. You are the crownless king. They only sell one product
[16076.56s -> 16081.82s]  You reach the top can't miss it walked away. Well, i'm back now aren't I?
[16085.40s -> 16092.60s]  You are no more heroes show me your passion release me from this cycle free us all in a crimson sea
[16096.32s -> 16098.32s]  You asked for it bring it on
[16105.68s -> 16130.58s]  And negotiate don't move shit he said the fucking thing
[16136.80s -> 16140.56s]  All right, the guy floating around his face was a little a guy floating around his face
[16140.64s -> 16142.96s]  It's gonna be better than a fighter lady
[16160.09s -> 16162.09s]  For you too
[16162.97s -> 16166.64s]  Wouldn't even be at a couple zeros
[16166.64s -> 16171.74s]  Those
[16172.06s -> 16178.06s]  Yeah, the guy's just looking to fucking get out of read receipts and one of the good cell phone signal is better than you
[16178.46s -> 16180.46s]  at full power
[16181.98s -> 16183.98s]  Ah shit shouldn't talk shit
[16204.96s -> 16206.96s]  Good parry here
[16207.60s -> 16222.62s]  I don't know. I think she's fell
[16224.54s -> 16234.06s]  All right, I need to charge
[16234.06s -> 16237.46s]  Oh
[16243.66s -> 16245.18s]  Get down from there
[16245.18s -> 16248.48s]  All right. Now she's just corner camping. She's just camping in the corner
[16249.20s -> 16252.16s]  She's got like a good item and she's just sitting there. Oh, I can't move
[16252.88s -> 16286.06s]  What are you doing stuck in the same move?
[16286.78s -> 16308.08s]  Holy shit lady
[16313.38s -> 16323.19s]  Your level was really long and this boss fight is just over
[16335.74s -> 16337.74s]  Oh, it's just going through the wall
[16338.54s -> 16341.02s]  Just going through the wall shit's going through the fuck
[16342.38s -> 16344.94s]  Okay, get the hell out of here frank too, by the way
[16348.64s -> 16351.04s]  You know nothing happened. We were in the middle of a big fight
[16351.76s -> 16353.84s]  And I she got hit in the head way too hard
[16354.88s -> 16358.96s]  Right off the bat and it was just slowing her down. It was just over if she couldn't she was all fucked up
[16360.56s -> 16363.31s]  Everything I hoped for
[16364.64s -> 16374.61s]  Don't matter how good you are you get like big fucking knock on the noggin was an assassin named alice. I won't forget
[16380.40s -> 16393.10s]  Number two boy number one
[16406.59s -> 16409.39s]  You are now officially ranked second
[16418.77s -> 16420.05s]  See that
[16420.05s -> 16422.05s]  Now that was a battle
[16422.13s -> 16427.09s]  Look at this blood. We humans are alive even if we are assassins
[16427.49s -> 16432.93s]  Doesn't matter if it's a video game movie drama anime manga. We're alive
[16433.65s -> 16435.65s]  People shed blood and die
[16436.13s -> 16437.73s]  This isn't a game
[16437.73s -> 16444.21s]  You can't just selfishly use death as your tool. Oh my god. Relax. Okay, you can have a han solo figurine
[16445.41s -> 16447.41s]  Sorry, I brought it up
[16455.10s -> 16459.52s]  Are you done bitching you could never shut down the association
[16460.48s -> 16464.40s]  Fighting to be the best is human nature. It's evolution
[16465.28s -> 16469.04s]  Who are we to try and stand in its way? Fuck that
[16469.60s -> 16476.32s]  I want to be a hero by my own standards. You need to wake up travis. Take your own goddamn advice
[16477.84s -> 16483.35s]  Alice moonlight
[16483.99s -> 16490.13s]  Who's number one?
[16490.13s -> 16513.16s]  10 hours and 20 minutes
[16513.16s -> 16515.16s]  Shave off about 25 of that though
[16515.40s -> 16517.01s]  That was spent
[16517.01s -> 16521.01s]  Um, that was spent doing the cvd tile game. It's me
[16521.73s -> 16525.24s]  Are you ready for your last battle to the death? Yeah
[16526.44s -> 16528.44s]  You know where to go

[16561.72s -> 16563.96s]  But there's a lot of things about you. I don't get
[16564.76s -> 16565.88s]  You lie
[16565.88s -> 16567.56s]  You're greedy
[16567.56s -> 16571.64s]  You're a fucking contradiction in heels. This always freaks me out. You hate me
[16572.28s -> 16577.00s]  Well, your personality kind of sucks like this is extra radiation. So you do hate me
[16578.64s -> 16580.64s]  I'm crazy about you
[16581.49s -> 16583.09s]  What do you mean?
[16583.09s -> 16593.19s]  Fuck if I know
[16593.19s -> 16609.30s]  You
[16609.30s -> 16615.75s]  Earthquake hang on to something
[16628.39s -> 16650.93s]  Okay

[16667.03s -> 16694.60s]  Do it anyways, you want to pretend to play with the cat anybody else feel like these these clothes smell like an attic?
[16695.89s -> 16697.89s]  That's a shirt you get out of the attic
[16698.47s -> 16710.34s]  And it stinks like mothballs and mildew and shit. It's very clearly an attic shirt
[16711.30s -> 16725.28s]  All right ranking battle number one, what about Naomi's lab are you gonna give me anything else to buy before the game ends?
[16725.92s -> 16737.64s]  It's only two weapons you can buy
[16738.12s -> 16757.91s]  No more gym legitimate business
[16758.63s -> 16761.20s]  I'm going for it. Let's go

[17873.69s -> 17877.72s]  Here's a game called, uh river city ransom
[17879.67s -> 17884.71s]  This just reminds me of river city ransom. You would go to this shop. There'd be like a bakery or like a coffee shop
[17885.19s -> 17887.19s]  And you'd sit down
[17887.27s -> 17889.67s]  And eat food for health and bonuses
[17890.23s -> 17894.55s]  You pick up the whole plate and eat the whole plate or you'd eat the cup too if you were buying a cup of tea
[17895.27s -> 17898.15s]  They would put the cup of tea in their mouth and crunch it down and eat it
[17905.86s -> 17907.86s]  I wonder if that game still holds up
[17907.86s -> 17909.86s]  Does that game hold up anybody? No
[17923.45s -> 17930.90s]  Jeremy you got good at the steak minigame, uh just to match the picture played on switch

[18165.43s -> 18178.42s]  Perfect take the pants off. Yeah
[18180.36s -> 18198.06s]  You can't
[18198.06s -> 18200.46s]  Like when you're at the convention and you have a big costume
[18201.48s -> 18205.80s]  And after two or three hours of walking around in the big top part that has a bunch of foam and shit
[18205.80s -> 18211.43s]  You probably get so this is like i'll walk around in the bottom half. That's fine in my t-shirt
[18217.58s -> 18219.58s]  I don't need anything spectacular up here
[18222.17s -> 18223.69s]  pursuit

[18820.38s -> 18826.01s]  There's nothing left to lose
[18826.71s -> 18829.75s]  Every day as joyless as the one before it
[18831.11s -> 18838.07s]  Eyes closed continue to endure. Why does the stream have the exact same camera angles when I come back?
[18838.87s -> 18840.87s]  after a while of not watching
[18841.93s -> 18845.69s]  Uh, because it's like a 20 chance. There's gonna be a close-up
[18846.89s -> 18870.10s]  Of a girl's chest on this game. Let me hear what you sound like as your dress

[19060.46s -> 19062.46s]  I feel like late july like july 29 30th
[19063.50s -> 19068.90s]  There's stuff going on, you know, like a new game might come out of it
[19082.22s -> 19087.50s]  Stake them with the easy bake up, uh, that will probably break and I don't want to break it
[19090.02s -> 19092.18s]  Cricket to the chainsaw guys before it runs up
[19108.36s -> 19111.74s]  This is very very painful
[19121.22s -> 19137.21s]  Wrestling I really hope the easy bake up and turns on
[19138.17s -> 19140.17s]  I really need to make sure the thing actually works
[19140.81s -> 19144.46s]  I gotta do a trial run to like heat it up a little bit before I even
[19145.10s -> 19147.72s]  Be bad
[19172.90s -> 19175.38s]  Why do I know exactly what you mean by toontown villains
[19194.95s -> 19196.79s]  Guys from the commercial
[19196.79s -> 19205.05s]  but these guys that uh
[19205.05s -> 19207.80s]  you guys have to have the um
[19209.61s -> 19212.30s]  You know, I'll just do the impression
[19212.30s -> 19215.26s]  And the goons are gonna take over toontown. They talk like that, right?
[19215.90s -> 19226.90s]  Something like that
[19226.90s -> 19232.79s]  Is it just one person back here?
[19233.11s -> 19238.02s]  There's no voice acting in toontown. I remember the commercial though. It was like a guy looked like goofy
[19238.50s -> 19241.70s]  And a pie was gone and he would like shoot pies at people's faces
[19243.38s -> 19247.22s]  The voiceover in the background talked like that. It was just like are we gonna save the toons?
[19247.78s -> 19250.44s]  You gotta get out there and make an account at toontown.org
[19251.62s -> 19253.62s]  Ask your parents permission first
[19254.41s -> 19256.01s]  I remember watching it
[19256.01s -> 19262.07s]  My mother didn't let me play it
[19262.07s -> 19269.75s]  I forgot to see what you guys were talking about. I didn't like how much how violent it was
[19283.45s -> 19285.45s]  Where's the last person?
[19294.68s -> 19296.68s]  old person
[19299.19s -> 19301.35s]  Stick to stick stick to sticks
[19302.15s -> 19306.23s]  What is that? What's that coming from?
[19313.11s -> 19319.37s]  What is that?
[19319.37s -> 19323.77s]  Game breaking bug delete the stream. No, it's just this one person hiding behind a wall
[19348.70s -> 19350.30s]  save the toons
[19350.30s -> 19356.09s]  Were there any disney characters in that game?
[19356.73s -> 19366.31s]  It was it was like goofy and donald duck and mickey and stuff
[19367.75s -> 19380.35s]  Okay, this is where we switch switch to your guy's favorite weapon
[19414.55s -> 19417.75s]  Go welding would be so bad
[19418.39s -> 19424.49s]  I feel like it would be a pain in the ass. You'd accidentally hit yourself and shit. It would be hard to
[19424.89s -> 19428.41s]  Oh, just give me a big heavy shield as in a small knife
[19430.87s -> 19433.11s]  I just want a huge steel shield that
[19433.99s -> 19435.27s]  blocks everything
[19435.27s -> 19437.51s]  and then like a paring knife like a cheese knife
[19438.39s -> 19440.70s]  and I get in close and just like
[19444.34s -> 19451.64s]  Step that step that step in the neck. I'm talking like small like a dagger little one
[19452.36s -> 19455.50s]  You mean a shield? That's what i'm saying. I just said shield
[19457.42s -> 19459.42s]  Shield with a small paring knife
[19460.22s -> 19468.68s]  You weren't always like I would do a two-handed broadsword. No, you wouldn't those things are like fucking 700 pounds. No, you wouldn't
[19469.48s -> 19474.79s]  I'd use a a double-sided katana. No, you wouldn't you'd cut your hole. You cut your legs off
[19475.91s -> 19479.11s]  No, you'd use a cheese knife with a big shield like the rest of them
[19479.91s -> 19486.81s]  You guys don't know it took it took four people to lift up a broadsword
[19490.55s -> 19492.55s]  one person to hold the the
[19492.63s -> 19494.44s]  shaft
[19494.44s -> 19497.80s]  Two people to hold that guy up by the shoulders and then a guy
[19498.36s -> 19500.84s]  And I kind of sit on in case you fall down
[19513.99s -> 19516.28s]  come here
[19516.28s -> 19519.03s]  spawn already
[19527.51s -> 19529.51s]  He's not spawned in come on
[19536.76s -> 19540.12s]  Yeah, but for most of us that are like man, I would love him. Uh, just like
[19540.68s -> 19544.84s]  It's like an old knight like king arthur. I would want a big sword like king arthur
[19545.72s -> 19550.44s]  You would pick that thing up do a huge swing with it and throw your back out and put it down and be like
[19550.52s -> 19552.52s]  Ah, never mind
[19553.48s -> 19560.97s]  You get like a muscle spasm on trying to hold it straight in the air
[19567.48s -> 19575.80s]  And then we get started on using a whip
[19576.04s -> 19584.38s]  You will swing that whip around and try to get practice it and that thing will come back and crack you in the face
[19585.58s -> 19588.14s]  And you're gonna lose the top half of your lip
[19601.35s -> 19606.07s]  What's the best weapon, uh, it's very easy take a small cheese knife
[19607.75s -> 19614.63s]  Or a spear just a long ass spear with a big pointy really light big pointy thing of the enemy
[19616.01s -> 19618.09s]  Walk and stick it for it
[19618.09s -> 19628.39s]  spear
[19628.39s -> 19630.39s]  big spear with a shield
[19630.47s -> 19640.41s]  or a big rock
[19640.41s -> 19645.37s]  No, I yeah, I know i could see that like a big stone like a big a big rock to throw at people
[19645.37s -> 19647.37s]  We'll like hit him with a headwind
[19649.67s -> 19652.68s]  Fear and shield. Yeah
[19652.68s -> 19655.40s]  That means people can't come near you and if they do they're gonna hit the shield
[19657.08s -> 19662.04s]  And this open the door, oh I have to open it
[19683.08s -> 19687.56s]  Yeah, and somebody's got it you do the thing where you you all have a shield and a spear
[19690.15s -> 19693.99s]  You stand back to back to back to back to back and you walk like a crab
[19695.61s -> 19697.61s]  Just no one will ever touch you
[19703.78s -> 19722.63s]  Phalanx phalanx formation. Yeah shit works. It was weak to fire bombs
[19725.24s -> 19726.12s]  um
[19726.12s -> 19728.28s]  We'll just update it and have like a powder guy
[19728.84s -> 19732.20s]  That has like a bunch of water and like powder and shit like jump on if there's a fire
[19733.88s -> 19739.51s]  You gotta have a weapon
[19743.80s -> 19745.56s]  Or just make a big umbrella
[19745.56s -> 19747.56s]  No, okay. Let me improve the balance
[19747.72s -> 19752.12s]  Just have a big umbrella made out of shield material that a guy in the middle holds up
[19752.36s -> 19755.88s]  So you got five you get six phalanxes that if they're out pacing out with their spears
[19756.60s -> 19762.30s]  And you've got a guy with an umbrella in the middle who walks with him who covers everybody with the steel shield umbrella
[19779.53s -> 19785.90s]  It don't matter you get arrows could hit the top of it it wouldn't matter you know walking
[19787.10s -> 19791.62s]  I mean you might not win any battles or anything. Yeah, eventually we'd have to advance and what are you gonna do?
[19792.66s -> 19795.40s]  Only one but for defensive purposes you know, we could touch it
[19803.91s -> 19807.91s]  Lose every battle. No, it's called only fight on your own home turf
[19809.94s -> 19817.59s]  Everybody does that
[19817.59s -> 19823.03s]  And everyone would be practicing the whole time and even like that like the waiters and waitresses and like the cook staff and stuff at restaurants
[19823.03s -> 19824.63s]  We're doing too
[19824.63s -> 19828.71s]  It's back to back walking backwards. We need to learn it's hard to do
[19842.73s -> 19852.26s]  What about tanks yeah, we're talking about not current we're talking about like medieval weapons stuff
[19858.87s -> 19866.09s]  Yeah, yes the solution if I had a phalanx right now, oh you what the fuck just snipe me from a mile away
[19873.02s -> 19875.34s]  Why are the shortest men the best generals
[19877.42s -> 19882.30s]  Uh, I think you're making a reference to napoleon napoleon lost 70 percent of every fighting with him
[19884.34s -> 19906.55s]  He's really good at chess
[19913.08s -> 19916.17s]  Wait wasn't uh, wouldn't napoleon like so good at what he did
[19916.25s -> 19919.61s]  They like shot him out of a cannon on an island or something and he wasn't allowed to come back
[19941.05s -> 19944.82s]  He came back and everybody was just cool with him
[19950.63s -> 19954.47s]  Why do I okay, hold on a minute i'm gonna be talking about potential
[19956.71s -> 19962.63s]  Potential spoilers for the marvel universe, especially a character that's very large and very green
[19963.11s -> 19967.19s]  So if you don't ever want to hear anybody like anything to do with the very large green person in marvel
[19968.07s -> 19972.95s]  Um, I I want to talk about some stuff that happened in the comic book and have a little comic book session
[19977.93s -> 19995.26s]  Uh, so i'm giving enough time for people to not want to listen to this
[19996.54s -> 19999.43s]  It's old but it's still you know, what if you're like in the middle of me?
[19999.43s -> 20002.95s]  I don't know what if you're in the middle of like reading marvel comics right now
[20002.95s -> 20006.23s]  I'm not about to you. You're on the i said the next page

[20023.94s -> 20025.94s]  On issue, whatever the fuck it is
[20026.10s -> 20029.22s]  For the uh series which was called the civil war series
[20033.35s -> 20039.03s]  Did they shoot hulk out of a cannon to like get rid of him like he's like napoleon they did the napoleon
[20048.14s -> 20050.14s]  They did this right so
[20050.70s -> 20052.70s]  Make sure I got that right
[20058.79s -> 20064.71s]  Fuck that was the next page is him getting shot out of the cannon with his hands all the way at his sides
[20065.85s -> 20068.41s]  Flying towards the camera with like a
[20069.30s -> 20074.26s]  Big speed lines behind him and the cannon in the distance with smoke. Sorry
[20074.98s -> 20083.77s]  I ruined it for you

[20094.54s -> 20105.74s]  About oh, sorry

[21719.16s -> 21721.48s]  That was the reason to play these this year was because I
[21722.28s -> 21724.28s]  Knew that the third one was coming out
[21724.28s -> 21726.28s]  I'll play the travis strikes again, too
[21726.76s -> 21732.09s]  Let's see how far I get in it. That's a long game though, isn't it? It's much longer than these first two, isn't it?
[21733.05s -> 21734.25s]  we'll see
[21734.25s -> 21742.38s]  When i'm playing it is the third game going to be on steam. I think it's going to be on switch
[21745.08s -> 21747.37s]  exclusively
[21747.37s -> 21756.65s]  Right. Yep
[21756.81s -> 21760.01s]  Switch is gonna overheat
[21760.25s -> 21765.63s]  Nintendo actually funded it
[21765.79s -> 21767.79s]  Well, that's good to hear
[21771.16s -> 21773.16s]  But uh, we did it. It's over
[21774.30s -> 21776.30s]  So that means you know what that means
[21776.70s -> 21782.06s]  That means tomorrow we're going to play president evil 3 remake. I'm gonna try to beat that tomorrow
[21783.31s -> 21785.42s]  then
[21785.42s -> 21787.52s]  Honey tunes wacky sports adventure on thursday

[21807.87s -> 21809.87s]  No, I think that's a good order
[21810.27s -> 21826.41s]  That's a good order. I want tiny tunes tomorrow. No, we're doing tiny things on thursday
[21827.45s -> 21829.95s]  and probably uh
[21829.95s -> 21831.95s]  Another secret game for the super nintendo

[21882.38s -> 21885.18s]  Died like seven or eight times and I was like nah fuck this game. I'm done
[21886.06s -> 21898.08s]  Oh, that's deep. That's deep in the game. That's level
[21898.72s -> 21900.72s]  That's level probably like 18
[21920.73s -> 21922.73s]  doom eventually to yeah

[22023.36s -> 22025.36s]  Rank one
[22026.83s -> 22031.31s]  11 hours and 52 minutes 11 hours and 10 minutes a lot of that was
[22032.20s -> 22033.32s]  ted talk
[22033.32s -> 22037.92s]  It's ted talk sound

[22074.86s -> 22078.17s]  i've heard
[22078.17s -> 22082.65s]  Things about it. I'm gonna make my own opinion on it. I've heard it's very short
[22083.21s -> 22086.65s]  I've heard it's not as good as the second one remake. I've heard it's
[22087.29s -> 22091.87s]  For the first time, you know, i'm going in with some muted, uh dialed back expectations
[22092.27s -> 22099.86s]  Raise yourself
[22099.86s -> 22106.02s]  Done took one hit not even the same dimension as the resident evil 2 remake

[22146.43s -> 22148.19s]  on my stream deck
[22148.19s -> 22150.19s]  Why is that connected to outro?
[22154.43s -> 22158.14s]  Oh because it was the first okay
[22162.70s -> 22166.22s]  That makes sense. Doesn't it? It was the image that was blown up

[22268.86s -> 22277.76s]  Hey germbo, do we still have plans for paper mario? I promise you'll like it eventually. It's not now other things going on first
[22279.58s -> 22281.58s]  Opster narwhal. Thanks for the 277
[22281.58s -> 22285.34s]  Will you play the remastered edition of spongebob battle for bikini bottom when it comes out?
[22285.74s -> 22287.42s]  Did you play the original?
[22287.42s -> 22292.06s]  It's a classic with a capital c i've never played battle for bikini bottom
[22292.30s -> 22295.26s]  I will play the remaster when it comes out. Yes, absolutely
[22295.90s -> 22297.92s]  I never played the original
[22297.92s -> 22306.29s]  Hey frito man. Thanks for the 15. Everyone asks. Where are the aliens but no one realizes they are all around us
[22306.61s -> 22311.75s]  We travel to other stars and even galaxies. We have to go beyond reaction based propulsion
[22312.29s -> 22314.29s]  and manipulate space time itself
[22314.69s -> 22317.57s]  The achievement of this feat will then allow us to travel beyond the fourth dimension
[22317.57s -> 22322.10s]  We inhibit as gravity the ultimate force in the universe travels through all dimensions
[22322.50s -> 22327.87s]  It is through reaching this that aliens will stop hiding and reveal extradimensional existence
[22330.43s -> 22333.87s]  Did you just copy and paste the top part of your paper you were doing for your project?
[22334.27s -> 22343.79s]  Because I mean it's pretty good writing so far everyone asks
[22344.27s -> 22351.26s]  Where are the aliens? That's a great opener for a school paper. Great. I would have done that. I would have done that
[22352.78s -> 22356.91s]  Open with a question open with a where the aliens i'm your teacher. I'm now you got my attention
[22357.15s -> 22364.50s]  Because then I say where are they? Yeah, they're right educate me school me nobody ever asks
[22364.98s -> 22366.74s]  How are the aliens?
[22366.74s -> 22374.96s]  No, they don't thanks to the 15 dollars. You're gonna get an a hey yoda 985. Thanks for the 260
[22375.04s -> 22393.60s]  Hey, mr. Germa, sir, if you have one, who is your favorite transformer bumblebee? See the next thing you should ask is
[22394.42s -> 22411.14s]  Name another transformer optimus prime is the only other one I can think of besides the decepticon
[22411.44s -> 22417.34s]  But I think that's a group of evil doing robots. I don't know who
[22418.54s -> 22422.58s]  The omega red is that the name of the bad one? What's the bet?
[22423.14s -> 22428.59s]  What's the bad guy's name omega lull red?
[22431.58s -> 22443.34s]  No, oh man. Hold on. No, that's a that's a x-men character. Never mind. Uh
[22445.21s -> 22452.61s]  Megatron that's right. Okay. There you go. That's my favorite. Hey bar broski. Thanks for the 300 bits
[22452.93s -> 22455.42s]  Germa, is it true you minored in art?
[22455.42s -> 22459.18s]  If so, do you have any work available for us to see i'd honestly love to watch a laid-back stream of you
[22459.18s -> 22461.98s]  Just drawing for a couple hours, even if it's just funny little doodles of your characters
[22464.03s -> 22468.38s]  Yeah, I idea and when I would go to i'm this bad
[22472.90s -> 22478.70s]  In my art classes, I didn't know the hell I was doing and every time there was a project to come in with something
[22478.94s -> 22484.93s]  This is not a joke one time. I actually did a full project in crayons
[22485.70s -> 22493.23s]  Because I was too lazy to go buy all the art supplies needed to actually do the project and actually do it for real and right
[22493.47s -> 22497.90s]  So I did it in crayons and I the best part about art
[22499.18s -> 22503.01s]  Anything can be anything anything can be anything
[22503.94s -> 22509.92s]  So I went in there after doing a full crayon picture and I I was like, yeah
[22510.24s -> 22516.37s]  I did the childlike way that I used the crayons for the medium and it was like, oh shit
[22519.50s -> 22530.83s]  What they didn't know is I just didn't buy the supplies yet because people would come up with like this really really awesome shit
[22531.46s -> 22537.90s]  Well, that's an amazing like actual detailed full person's face in charcoal. All right, mr
[22537.90s -> 22545.94s]  Elbertson, come on up. It's my picture of a house that I did in crayons. I did it on purpose
[22547.54s -> 22550.10s]  Oh, you did. Yes. Wow
[22550.90s -> 22559.60s]  Excellent work. Mr. Elbertson. Thanks. I did it hard. It was very hard people happy
[22563.28s -> 22566.14s]  But there were actually some I love forget about drawing
[22566.38s -> 22569.58s]  I can't draw and I've I've refused to try to learn because I've tried a million times
[22569.82s -> 22573.42s]  I don't have the patience for it. I have no patience for it. I'm never gonna learn and I it's okay
[22574.54s -> 22582.72s]  I like clay. I like molding. I like sculpting. I don't like to do it, but I like I I enjoy it. I enjoy
[22583.44s -> 22589.17s]  Clay because it can be mushed around and molded and you can make uh, like statues within stuff
[22589.98s -> 22601.01s]  It's cool. And yeah, the bugleberry pottery. Yes physical media crew unite just interesting to me
[22601.17s -> 22609.07s]  I like the way it feels. He's never gonna draw a manga probably not
[22616.10s -> 22618.50s]  I did I did do it and I learned a lot
[22618.58s -> 22620.58s]  There's a lot of things in art history that was interesting
[22620.74s -> 22631.44s]  I remember not enough to tell you what they were but that I remember how they interesting they were thanks to the three dollars though
[22634.34s -> 22643.44s]  Hey the dinkster, thanks for the five dollars. Haha. Jerma smells. I don't actually I smell pretty good lm man
[22643.52s -> 22646.00s]  Thanks for the 250 jerma since you like no more heroes
[22646.00s -> 22654.34s]  If you consider playing mad world a disc is right behind me that actually is is it gonna be kind of sad to say
[22655.95s -> 22663.06s]  That is one of only I think three or four more games for the wii that I have to play on this stream
[22663.30s -> 22672.61s]  The supply is running dry pickman two. No, that's for the game cube
[22672.61s -> 22681.50s]  But still I count them both because I play it in the wii mad world what else is back here?

[22736.35s -> 22739.39s]  A unpronounceable offspring. Thanks for the ten dollars
[22739.39s -> 22742.19s]  Just want to say i've been watching your streams for years through youtube clips

[22744.51s -> 22747.31s]  Have you thought about checking out war of the monsters?
[22748.11s -> 22750.11s]  Cheers. Well, thanks for the ten dollars
[22751.15s -> 22756.56s]  Uh, I think I think we've talked about this game before this is a fighting game, right?
[22757.28s -> 22763.07s]  We've yeah, we talked about this before just have to get it
[22763.63s -> 22769.78s]  Did they remake it or something? Why am I seeing stuff from 2015?
[22770.34s -> 22784.35s]  Did they put it on psn? They did right? Okay. We'll put it on the list where the monsters was a good ps2 game
[22784.83s -> 22790.51s]  I'll give it a try. Let's roll the credits

[23023.92s -> 23031.76s]  Um, hey just like measure just like uh, show it. Uh, hey like what what kind of sneakers do you have show them?
[23032.00s -> 23047.06s]  You know what somebody tells you show them, you know, you probably should know that it's like, uh, no, you know
[23047.30s -> 23050.58s]  Hey jeremy, can you please measure your foot and just prove that it's 10.2 inches?
[23050.66s -> 23055.70s]  I just want to know jeremy. Can you please measure your foot and show that? Oh, you want to show it?
[23055.94s -> 23069.97s]  Okay, see now I know hey, you're just mad at 10 point. What are you talking about rip alex rebec?
[23069.97s -> 23071.65s]  Thanks to the 500 bits jeremy great stream
[23071.65s -> 23076.85s]  Just want to update you on the status of the custom german 985 funko pops you commissioned from me last stream
[23077.42s -> 23082.40s]  Factories pumping them out at max speed and just the payment advance a couple weeks earlier
[23083.50s -> 23089.34s]  Also, they use a non-polar paint that causes birth defects. Can't wait to deliver them to you and all tax-free
[23093.76s -> 23097.20s]  I'm not reading the rest of this. I'm not reading the message anymore. That's what I actually believe
[23098.46s -> 23103.97s]  I actually yeah
[23103.97s -> 23108.16s]  I'm not saying that I don't want to say that like I don't want to say that
[23111.92s -> 23119.42s]  I don't want to say I like don't want to say those words. No, i'm not going to read it
[23119.82s -> 23126.82s]  They say something about them having they don't something about all right. It's the they say the irs they say
[23127.92s -> 23129.92s]  Gosh, darn it. I'm paying my taxes
[23130.46s -> 23136.96s]  And yeah, we all pay them. We all have to pay them. Welcome to life bug smoke. Thanks for the 250
[23138.56s -> 23141.84s]  A few days ago. I donated and talked about my first experiences watching your content
[23142.08s -> 23144.70s]  I wrote that I used to hate your videos before being a fan
[23145.02s -> 23146.86s]  That seemed to hit you the wrong way
[23146.86s -> 23150.78s]  I want to send this to clarify my wording before watching you
[23150.78s -> 23154.74s]  I just assume you were a typical tuber and that I would have hated your videos
[23154.74s -> 23157.38s]  Okay, that was obviously an incorrect judgment
[23157.54s -> 23162.54s]  I've liked all the content i've seen you do even the escape stream keep up the content
[23162.62s -> 23173.26s]  You mean the unlock stream? Well, that makes one of you one of us. He's a two. I'm a tuber at heart
[23174.58s -> 23181.42s]  All right, I am i'll always be a tuber, you know, yeah, that's not gonna grow out of me
[23181.50s -> 23194.62s]  I'll always be a tuber. I'm just a twitch tuber. Thanks to the 250. Glad you don't hate my videos a dream boom
[23194.70s -> 23196.70s]  Thanks for the five dollars. Thanks for streaming a series
[23196.70s -> 23200.19s]  I love did you check the extended trailer of no more heroes three?
[23200.27s -> 23206.26s]  I have by the way killer seven was also made by suda 51 and has a good remaster on steam check that out
[23206.26s -> 23209.14s]  Whenever you have the time, i'm sure the chat will love it. Keep up the great work
[23209.46s -> 23213.47s]  It's been on the list for a while
[23213.47s -> 23219.07s]  But I feel like no more heroes three will come out before I have the before I want to play
[23219.55s -> 23230.29s]  Killer seven I feel like that's gonna happen first killer seven's a stoner game. That's all right. Hey, it's boo
[23230.37s -> 23233.49s]  Thanks for the three dollars seeing you play some more suda 51 games
[23233.49s -> 23238.43s]  I'd like to see you play shadows of the damned for the playstation 3 his production team had a hand in it
[23238.98s -> 23241.78s]  Sadly, the sales weren't up to par but it was a very unique experience
[23242.18s -> 23249.04s]  And i'm sad to see not a lot of people have played what was the game that was a suda 51 game
[23251.34s -> 23258.46s]  Where at the very beginning there was this big frog boss we played it
[23259.58s -> 23268.38s]  What was the suda 51 game that we played with the weird frog thing in the beginning never dead. That's what it was
[23268.46s -> 23283.23s]  Okay, that was a marvelous entertainment game, right? That's not suda 51
[23284.66s -> 23293.25s]  Never dead is not suda 51. This is not never dead. Uh
[23296.01s -> 23306.40s]  Director no is no. Hold on. This had nothing to do with suda 51
[23314.22s -> 23320.30s]  Oh, I think I just thought it was a suda 51 game and it became fact in my brain. Oh, that's interesting
[23320.94s -> 23323.57s]  Well, yeah, i'll check it out
[23323.65s -> 23333.84s]  See you tomorrow. Have a good night. It's still two or three more bits. I just want to say good night to you right now
[23336.83s -> 23338.83s]  Convo breaker. Thanks to 250
[23339.60s -> 23346.32s]  Dear jeremiah, i'm sorry for causing you distress sometimes but I cannot hold back from jumping when all the chat is yelling at you blatant lies
[23346.80s -> 23348.80s]  And or misinformation at the same time
[23348.96s -> 23355.20s]  It's just too funny kind of like my addiction to picking food above the floor saying when in doubt radish it out and then eating it
[23355.44s -> 23359.36s]  I can't stop myself. Please help dear god. Also, I don't know how much people like jrpgs
[23359.92s -> 23361.92s]  Xenoblade chronicles is like chrono trigger
[23362.72s -> 23365.04s]  Like a chrono trigger tier jrpg in the decade
[23365.76s -> 23371.10s]  And I don't know what's real. It's hard to determine what's even real
[23374.83s -> 23378.24s]  Never played it. You know blade is a thousand hours long
[23379.20s -> 23382.66s]  You probably won't see it on this stream
[23382.82s -> 23384.82s]  There's a strong cutoff
[23385.86s -> 23390.74s]  On this channel where if a game is going to take more than 40 to 50 hours on paper
[23391.30s -> 23394.42s]  That means it's going to be one to two hundred hours on this stream
[23395.14s -> 23398.62s]  I don't think I have the
[23398.62s -> 23400.62s]  Brain to commit to that
[23400.70s -> 23409.79s]  But I will play chrono trigger because I know everything about it
[23410.51s -> 23412.51s]  Blueberry juice. Thanks for 250
[23413.09s -> 23415.57s]  No, you can't just use the peony for the entire game
[23416.83s -> 23417.87s]  uh
[23417.87s -> 23419.87s]  unga bunga orc
[23420.03s -> 23422.03s]  big pea sword oh
[23422.67s -> 23424.83s]  Boom, I respect your commitment to the strength build
[23425.39s -> 23429.63s]  Also, it's pronounced wielding not welding you illiterate stacom brained caveman
[23430.59s -> 23432.59s]  The other one that said the caveman thing
[23437.44s -> 23440.16s]  Stacom and it's fun to say too
[23440.88s -> 23445.12s]  Hey drumager. Thanks for the 250 what the fuck happened to resident evil 4 on wii. That was the stream
[23445.12s -> 23447.68s]  I was looking forward to the most july 30th
[23450.45s -> 23452.45s]  July 30th. I already said it
[23452.53s -> 23466.54s]  What happened to it july 30th? It's on my list for july 30th. I have a lot of things for july 30th
[23468.96s -> 23470.96s]  The ftk stream is also july 30th
[23475.30s -> 23477.30s]  july 30th
