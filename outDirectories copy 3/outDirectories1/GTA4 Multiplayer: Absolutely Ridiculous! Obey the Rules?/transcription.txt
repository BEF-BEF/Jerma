[0.31s -> 13.63s]  Yeah, I found a- oh my god, there's four, like, police helicopters here. There's so many RPGs.
[13.63s -> 15.81s]  Oh, Ster, what are you doing?
[15.81s -> 18.81s]  I, like, drove up there. You're already gone.
[18.81s -> 21.81s]  I'm climbing up the top of this, like, construction beam.
[21.81s -> 24.98s]  I'll fly this over to you so you can get the weapons.
[24.98s -> 28.38s]  I just gotta be able to fly without crashing into-
[28.38s -> 29.38s]  Oh, wow.
[29.38s -> 30.38s]  It's a long way up.
[30.38s -> 38.58s]  They're so confused, they, like, can't get over- they, like, don't know what to do.
[38.58s -> 41.58s]  They're just, like, all down there.
[41.58s -> 45.04s]  Some of these guys are just walking around in circles.
[45.04s -> 50.99s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[50.99s -> 51.99s]  What have I done?
[51.99s -> 53.23s]  What'd you do?
[53.23s -> 54.23s]  Run?
[54.23s -> 55.23s]  Oh!
[55.23s -> 56.41s]  Oh!
[56.41s -> 58.41s]  Oh, no!
[58.41s -> 59.97s]  Don't fall down the hole!
[59.97s -> 61.40s]  What?
[61.40s -> 64.54s]  What just happened there?
[64.54s -> 70.16s]  You dropped- you dropped, like, a bomb behind me and it blew me down the hole!
[73.16s -> 75.16s]  Oh, no!
[77.10s -> 79.10s]  What? What?
[79.10s -> 81.10s]  All I heard was, oops, that's not good.
[81.10s -> 86.10s]  And all of a sudden I just fly forward and my body rolls into the freaking hole.
[86.10s -> 89.10s]  It went down the tube?
[89.10s -> 94.10s]  Yeah, I rolled- like, I was, like, a piece of, like, hair going down a bathroom sink.
[94.10s -> 97.43s]  Oh, no!
[107.44s -> 111.64s]  Dude, some dealership just, like, made out, like, a bandit.
[111.64s -> 113.64s]  All these poor ladies do legs.
[113.64s -> 115.64s]  They really all are the same car.
[115.64s -> 117.64s]  Hey, look, everybody has, like, a Saturn.
[117.64s -> 122.25s]  Maybe run her over.
[122.25s -> 123.62s]  Holy cow.
[123.62s -> 125.62s]  Yeah, I need assault now. I'm one shot.
[125.62s -> 127.62s]  I'm out of ammo in my assault rifle.
[127.62s -> 129.62s]  I can't believe that helicopter- what is this helicopter doing?
[129.62s -> 131.62s]  What is this guy doing?
[131.62s -> 133.62s]  Wow, what an idiot.
[133.62s -> 135.62s]  There he is!
[135.62s -> 137.62s]  I just saw him.
[137.62s -> 139.62s]  I'm all by myself.
[139.62s -> 141.62s]  This is a helicopter graveyard.
[141.62s -> 143.62s]  This is, like, 30 helicopters here.
[143.62s -> 145.62s]  Whoa! Oh, my God!
[150.86s -> 155.02s]  Oh, my-
[155.02s -> 157.02s]  30 helicopters here.
[157.02s -> 159.02s]  Yeah!
[159.02s -> 167.73s]  Oh, my God!
[172.74s -> 174.98s]  I just, like, elbowed it.
[174.98s -> 176.98s]  Oh, it's still there on my screen.
[176.98s -> 180.69s]  I'm keeping this one.
[180.69s -> 182.69s]  Here we go.
[182.69s -> 184.69s]  It's time to obey the rules of the road.
[184.69s -> 187.06s]  Starting now.
[187.06s -> 189.06s]  We are now law-abiding citizens.
[189.06s -> 191.06s]  Is there, like, a speed limit button?
[191.06s -> 193.06s]  Yeah.
[193.06s -> 195.06s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[195.06s -> 197.06s]  Police officer.
[197.06s -> 199.06s]  Oh, that guy just passed us.
[199.06s -> 201.06s]  Yeah, what was that all about?
[201.06s -> 203.06s]  It was a police officer.
[203.06s -> 205.06s]  You're supposed to pull to the right.
[205.06s -> 207.06s]  Oh, excuse me!
[209.06s -> 211.06s]  All right, I'm going to be-
[211.06s -> 213.06s]  My right blinker is on.
[213.06s -> 215.06s]  I'm going to be taking a right-hand turn here.
[215.06s -> 217.06s]  I broke your right taillight by accident.
[217.06s -> 219.06s]  Hey, look at this guy.
[219.06s -> 221.06s]  Hey, you need to calm down, buddy.
[221.06s -> 223.06s]  He's taking a left-
[223.06s -> 225.06s]  His left blinker is on.
[225.06s -> 227.06s]  He's in the middle of the road.
[227.06s -> 229.06s]  Look at this guy's head.
[229.06s -> 231.06s]  Oh my god.
[231.06s -> 233.06s]  What is this cop doing?
[233.06s -> 235.74s]  Oh my god.
[235.74s -> 237.74s]  What?
[239.74s -> 241.74s]  I'm not absorbing this.
[241.74s -> 243.74s]  Does anybody have a star?
[243.74s -> 247.74s]  I may have three stars by accident.
[247.74s -> 249.74s]  You have three stars?
[249.74s -> 251.74s]  Oh, this cop is right next to me.
[251.74s -> 253.74s]  He's going to pull down.
[253.74s -> 255.74s]  I'm still obeying the rules, not my problem.
[255.74s -> 257.74s]  Drive safely.
[257.74s -> 259.74s]  He's in my car.
[259.74s -> 261.74s]  This guy's passing-
[261.74s -> 263.74s]  I'm trying to let him pass.
[263.74s -> 265.74s]  Oh, boo, it's in your car.
[265.74s -> 267.74s]  It's a red light.
[267.74s -> 269.74s]  It's a red light.
[269.74s -> 271.74s]  It's green, it's green.
[271.74s -> 273.74s]  We have to get them away from you.
[273.74s -> 275.74s]  It's a red light, boo. I don't think we can go yet.
[275.74s -> 277.74s]  It's green, it's green.
[277.74s -> 279.74s]  It's a shotgun!
[279.74s -> 281.74s]  Get out of here.
[281.74s -> 283.74s]  Get out of here.
[283.74s -> 285.74s]  Oh my god.
[285.74s -> 287.74s]  It's so bossy.
[287.74s -> 289.74s]  She's trying to drive safely.
[289.74s -> 291.74s]  Alright, Steph, I'm going to be taking a left-hand turn here.
[291.74s -> 293.74s]  I'm taking fire on my vehicle.
[297.98s -> 299.98s]  My car! Look how scratched it is.
[299.98s -> 301.98s]  Oh no.
[301.98s -> 303.98s]  The cop, man.
[303.98s -> 305.98s]  He's like pulling up alongside.
[309.98s -> 311.98s]  Oh, it's green.
[311.98s -> 313.98s]  Go left.
[315.98s -> 317.98s]  Oh no, there's a one-way.
[317.98s -> 319.98s]  There's a one-way back up.
[319.98s -> 321.98s]  There's a one-way.
[321.98s -> 323.98s]  They're pushing us sideways.
[323.98s -> 325.98s]  That's a one-way.
[325.98s -> 327.98s]  I think boo turned all the way around.
[327.98s -> 329.98s]  I saw that.
[329.98s -> 332.22s]  No, no, no. No one noticed.
[332.22s -> 334.22s]  Alright, actually, can we pull over for a second, guys?
[334.22s -> 336.78s]  I kind of want a hot dog.
[336.78s -> 338.78s]  I'm kind of hungry.
[338.78s -> 340.78s]  I kind of want a hot dog.
[340.78s -> 342.78s]  There's no vendor there.
[342.78s -> 344.78s]  Is it closed?
[344.78s -> 346.78s]  What?
[346.78s -> 348.78s]  What happened there?
[348.78s -> 351.92s]  Disconnected from live.
[351.92s -> 355.57s]  Too bad there's no vendor here.
[355.57s -> 357.57s]  My car!
[357.57s -> 359.81s]  My car!
