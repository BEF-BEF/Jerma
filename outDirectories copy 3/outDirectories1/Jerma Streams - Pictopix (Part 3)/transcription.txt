[6.07s -> 16.74s]  I scare you. Alright, let's begin a wind down here. I'm gonna play a few pick-cross levels,
[16.74s -> 30.15s]  we'll just chill. Gonna close out of Sekiro though. What's the total in-game time? Let's see,
[30.15s -> 37.64s]  I'm curious. Because I saw articles, reviewers, other streamers talk about their game time,
[37.64s -> 46.76s]  I'm just curious what the actual in-game time was. Let's see, how long did it take me to beat
[46.76s -> 51.80s]  Sekiro? Let's see, the last hour, the last two hours or so was not finishing the game.
[52.68s -> 66.50s]  Just wandering around, right? Let's see. I have 42 hours in Sekiro, so the last two hours or so
[66.50s -> 74.15s]  were spent kind of walking around doing optional stuff. So 40 hours. It took just about 40 hours
[74.15s -> 81.62s]  to beat the game. That sounds about right. And that's pretty much, most people have said, between
[81.62s -> 93.54s]  35 to 55 hours. 30 to 40 is average, yeah. Damn, it was fun. And that's the end of that.
[93.54s -> 105.26s]  Just finished my second playthrough at 45 hours. That sounds about right. Any thoughts on Borderlands
[105.26s -> 117.54s]  3? No, I'm not really a Borderlands fan, I never was. Dude, there's a PictoPix update from like a
[117.54s -> 124.36s]  week ago. Hello everybody, I'm very excited to announce that a new free update is available for
[124.36s -> 135.61s]  PictoPix. This update adds new content. We got new content, boys and girls. He hates Borderlands. I
[135.61s -> 143.02s]  just don't really like it. I don't hate it, but I don't really, I never really was a fan. Not that
[143.02s -> 166.23s]  I don't like the idea. Let's get it open here. It's not his cup of tea. Yeah, yeah. I watched
[166.23s -> 172.25s]  your first PictoPix stream and now I have 21 hours in the game. It's great. I'm so happy if you never
[172.25s -> 187.91s]  even knew what PictoPix was, if you're into it now. PictoPix, there it is. There we go. Play.
[192.09s -> 200.82s]  Let's go classic. This is where we're at here. This is, is it linked to Twitch again? So you guys
[200.82s -> 219.93s]  can guess. Should be. Maybe not. Let me make sure it's, oops. Enable to, ah there we go. Let's turn
[219.93s -> 231.70s]  it on. Should be on now. There we go. Now you guys can guess what it is. So this is 15 by 15.
[232.50s -> 243.16s]  So we start off here. We got 10, 11. Can't really do much there. 8, 9, 10. I could get the 8,
[243.88s -> 252.10s]  but I just go like this and pretend. So that's 1. We got how many? 1. That's 14, 13. So 1, 2,
[252.10s -> 261.18s]  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. I can probably go like this. So 8. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Maybe not,
[262.06s -> 270.01s]  because that would mean I'd have to go like kind of halfway through here. Let's see. 8,
[272.58s -> 290.98s]  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I guess maybe like a couple of these could be between here. 9, 2,
[290.98s -> 305.96s]  4, 6. Why is it telling like dad jokes? Why are there cat facts going on with Nightbot?
[307.00s -> 324.82s]  What? Let's see. 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, not 15. Not a whole lot to start with here.
[327.83s -> 335.45s]  I mean I guess you go 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. We know that. As long as this is correct, which it kind
[335.45s -> 350.55s]  of has to be. Now does that help anything else? Not really. I mean I guess here. Harder than Ishin.
[350.55s -> 356.39s]  Oh yeah, I can see 3. This has to be 1, 2, 3. It has to be here somewhere so there's no way it can
[356.39s -> 368.07s]  be any of these. This might be the 2. I can't really tell. The hardest decisions require the
[368.07s -> 377.03s]  strongest wills. I'm surprised I don't have anything here like at the bottom or down here.
[377.03s -> 395.50s]  Let me see. So that's 14, 13. Let me see here. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[396.54s -> 406.95s]  So actually I don't know that info. I do not know that info. This makes it kind of worse though.
[415.06s -> 428.54s]  Where am I getting the two x's on the bottom? Well with the larger, you've got to look for
[428.54s -> 432.86s]  large numbers because you can fill them in because it has to be somewhere in the middle. But the
[432.86s -> 435.98s]  reason why I'm doing the bottom x's here is because there has to be a 1 in a space.
[436.78s -> 443.69s]  So there has to be at least two spaces before 8 is here. You know what I mean? So it can help
[443.69s -> 451.56s]  sometimes. This one's kind of tricky because there's really not much to go on right now.
[451.56s -> 480.94s]  Because this is 14. So it's not 15 down. 7, 8, 9. I'm kind of stuck here. There's no way to tell
[480.94s -> 495.78s]  this is the 1 or the 2. What down here? Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's just say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[496.82s -> 507.03s]  Now there's too many. It's too much. Too much of a space. See this one on the other hand,
[507.03s -> 516.18s]  you could mean, let's just look at it. Two spaces. It could be anywhere. It could be like this,
[516.98s -> 538.01s]  right? It's too hard to tell. Because hold on. 3, 2, 2. This is part of the 8. Let's see. 1,
[538.01s -> 551.26s]  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This is not enough to go on. Because this could be here, right? 1, 2, 3, 2,
[551.90s -> 586.09s]  2, 3, or this could be 3, or this could be 2. I need more info. Fuck. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[586.89s -> 597.38s]  There's too many spaces. You've got five full spaces of space here that,
[598.86s -> 615.82s]  like, let's just say the overlap would have to be. That's too many. 4, 4, 3. It's just,
[618.38s -> 621.18s]  you really would have to just go like this. Yeah, I'm gonna have to go like this. So
[623.24s -> 626.20s]  this is probably close enough. So it's probably gonna be something like this.
[627.00s -> 636.98s]  At least these two. At least these two at least probably have to be filled in. Because if you do
[636.98s -> 650.39s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3. I don't know. Because it could be like this then, right? The outlier here is this
[650.39s -> 659.74s]  one's always filled in. So this one has to be filled in. Therefore 1, 2, 3. This is 1, 2, 3.
[660.62s -> 673.82s]  All right. A little bit more info. Which leaves... Let's go like that. Let's just clear these.
[674.62s -> 698.84s]  All right. Where the fuck are we now? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. If it was 4, I could fill in both of these.
[699.56s -> 711.96s]  It's not though. Oh, my brain is kind of on... I'm pretty slow right now. I'm not gonna lie.
[712.68s -> 717.06s]  I'm in like the post-securo fucking... I'm like about to fall asleep.
[720.47s -> 731.80s]  Uh, well there's no music playing right here. Let's put the jazz music on. There we go.
[735.98s -> 750.84s]  This is definitely part of the three at this point. Go to sleep. I'm all right for now.
[750.84s -> 767.29s]  I might just call it here in like 20 minutes. Uh, I gotta have something better than that.
[772.33s -> 791.24s]  Fuck this one. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Oh, fuck that one.
[791.80s -> 806.12s]  Okay, that's it for this. He died to Picross. We got 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Look at that.
[806.12s -> 826.20s]  Perfect. 13. Done. And so this is 1, 2, 3. Uh-huh. 1, 2, 3. Good. This... Let's see. Let's say it was
[826.20s -> 835.24s]  2 here. Let's just take a look. So we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let's just say it's either here or here.
[836.65s -> 842.41s]  No way for me to do to get that. Let's just do it from here. So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
[842.41s -> 855.46s]  9, 10, 11, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 4 on each side. That works. Died to gridwheel. So this is 3, 1, 2. That
[855.46s -> 864.87s]  means this is done. Nothing else underneath it. There's the 1. And 1, 2, 3 has to be up here somewhere
[864.87s -> 881.66s]  like that. Speaking of 11s. 12, 13, 14, 15. 12, 13, 14, 15. All right. What do we got up here? 2, 1, 2.
[886.86s -> 896.02s]  That's a lot there. Let's see. What about down here? 2, 1. So there's the 2, 1, 2. This might be the
[896.02s -> 906.87s]  same thing. This is... Yeah, that's probably... That's the 2. So then look down here. 2, 3, 4.
[906.87s -> 917.48s]  It's blocking itself out. This is probably the 3 right here. Also 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.
[918.12s -> 923.30s]  That makes this a little easier. There's your 1. 3. There's your 1 and your 2. This is 3.
[924.76s -> 931.13s]  3 in the middle, right? There you go. Bingo. There's your 2. There's your other 2. Part of the 7.
[931.69s -> 945.59s]  3, 3, 3. Looking good. 1, 1, 3. This is also that 1. It has to be a 3 here. So it could be
[945.59s -> 949.51s]  1, 2, 3. It could be 3 here. Either this side or this side. Can't really tell right now.
[950.47s -> 956.39s]  What about... What's going on over here? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. This is... This
[956.39s -> 965.37s]  might be already done here. Let's see. And then 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Not quite. 3 is definitely right
[965.37s -> 976.49s]  here in the middle though. Has to be. Same thing with the other one. That leaves us with... Let's
[976.49s -> 982.57s]  just take a second here. This is the... These are both... These are all 4s down here. So because
[982.57s -> 991.30s]  there's only 5 options, it's got to be all the ones in the bottom there. I would say the same
[991.30s -> 998.30s]  thing here. Unless we... Hold on. 1, 2, 3. Now it could be... It's possible. Although improbable,
[998.30s -> 1004.39s]  but still... It is still possible. Because up here is also a 3. But it could be there.
[1006.39s -> 1008.23s]  Somebody came in and said, what is happening?
[1012.87s -> 1024.58s]  What are you doing? What is happening? 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Same deal. Does that help us over this way?
[1024.58s -> 1038.76s]  2, 1. Here is the 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We know it's the two middle ones. Now is that the 2? This is
[1038.76s -> 1056.34s]  the 1. This is also part of a 4. 2, 4. So it's got to be these ones. That's a 1. A 1, 2, 3, 4 again.
[1057.22s -> 1069.08s]  What about here? 2, 1. I've got nothing here. 1, 2. There it is. Simple. Absolute simple. Making a
[1069.08s -> 1075.96s]  picture. Yeah. The way that Picross works is you build out with these logic puzzles a picture.
[1076.60s -> 1089.80s]  If you do exclamation point guess, you can guess to see what it is. 1, 1, 3. It could be this.
[1090.60s -> 1106.44s]  1, 3, 2. No, this might be the 3. If that's the case. What about up top? 2. Somewhere in here.
[1108.97s -> 1119.64s]  1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. I mean, it has to be the middle ones. This is definitely the 1.
[1120.36s -> 1134.25s]  There's 2. And there's the other 2. This is harder than Sekiro. Some of that can be really,
[1134.25s -> 1138.71s]  really just challenging. That's the last one. I couldn't even. Sometimes you just sit there
[1138.71s -> 1142.23s]  and look at it and it doesn't click. Nothing clicks on it. You just skip and go to another one. There's
[1142.23s -> 1158.50s]  like hundreds of them. Hmm. Plane. Yeah, that was a plane rumor. Crashing by. Just flying by.
[1158.50s -> 1166.73s]  1, 2, 3, 4. Nothing there. All right, so hold on. Wait, wait. This has to be 3.
[1167.53s -> 1177.50s]  So if that's the case, then it can't be any of these. Oh, shit. So this is definitely the 3.
[1178.30s -> 1185.94s]  I'm thinking the 3s. There's still one up here. So is that enough info to figure that out? This,
[1185.94s -> 1191.86s]  let's see. 1. Yeah, that has to be there. Unless I made a mistake, which I don't think I did.
[1194.66s -> 1209.82s]  And that's it for the 4. All three 4s. Somebody let me out of here. I'm in hell.
[1210.87s -> 1228.89s]  You're okay. Now let's see. Yeah, this is it. 1, 1, 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2, 1. Close. Close.
[1232.86s -> 1248.65s]  Could be either one. Still don't know about this side. Are they meant to be all white? Yeah,
[1248.65s -> 1259.05s]  you'll see when it's complete, it turns into a colored picture. Is the 1 here or is the 1 here?
[1259.05s -> 1272.54s]  Probably here. This is a 5 here. This is, okay, hold on. Let's just say 2, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[1273.50s -> 1282.95s]  No, the 5 is right here. There's the 2 and the 5. Here's the 1. Okay. These are all 1s, except
[1282.95s -> 1296.44s]  this one's a 2. Done. There's your 1. There's your 2. Oh, it feels good. Then we got 1. This is a 2.
[1298.78s -> 1308.01s]  And this is also a 2. That's part of the 11. 11's done. I think I can get some more of these in here.
[1308.01s -> 1314.49s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. No, I can't.
[1322.62s -> 1327.02s]  And it's just happening so quickly now. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Middle can go.
[1329.62s -> 1346.50s]  It's on its way. All right. What is it? I don't know. 2. Let's say 2, 1. It's apparently a building.
[1349.18s -> 1365.45s]  Where is this 4? Oh, there's a 5. Here it is. So 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1.
[1366.33s -> 1382.09s]  This is 11. Done. 3. Got it. That is done. This row's done. And then 7 here. So 7.
[1383.05s -> 1399.02s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Bingo. Done. The 1 has to be right there. 1, 2, 3, 11.
[1399.74s -> 1416.82s]  And that's it. It is a house. A hut. Who got it? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Have you got it?
[1417.46s -> 1428.55s]  A hut. Nice work. So this is 15 by 15, but that's a lie. It's actually, that's 10.
[1430.44s -> 1433.96s]  This should be fairly easy to get a lot of these, because 8, 9, 10. The middle one's here.
[1435.75s -> 1448.89s]  6 is 4 on the sides. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. 7, 3. Okay. What about 5? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[1448.89s -> 1459.51s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Sorry, sir. You can't do that. 11, though, is 4 on the sides.
[1460.15s -> 1472.68s]  We have to count up to 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[1472.68s -> 1478.68s]  I can't really do anything else. All right. What we got to work with here? Anything else? We got
[1478.68s -> 1493.51s]  6, 8, 4, 7. 1, 2, 3, 4. X that one. 1, 2, 3, 4. It has to be up somewhere here. It's 11. All right.
[1493.59s -> 1505.99s]  So 3, 8, 5, 1, 3. I wonder if this is the 5, probably. And then if that's the 1,
[1506.79s -> 1522.84s]  we got 1, 2, 3, maybe. Could go here. If this is 1, 2, 3, that has to be the same. This is definitely
[1522.84s -> 1536.89s]  the second 3, because there's not enough room for it there. So 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 3 is in here
[1536.89s -> 1548.34s]  somewhere. Yeah, this just kind of has to be the 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's just clean it up.
[1554.17s -> 1561.80s]  Any combinations here that I can do? I'm so mad that Jeremy plays this. This was my secret game.
[1561.80s -> 1569.05s]  Why are you mad that I enjoy a great, interesting, relaxing, fun game? Why does that make you mad?
[1572.44s -> 1579.80s]  I'm so mad that Jeremy likes this. This is my thing. This is my secret game.
[1580.36s -> 1598.49s]  I could get the 8 here. Let's see. Okay, so let's just say 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[1600.86s -> 1605.98s]  That's definitely the 4. I mean, that would be very odd. That would be really odd if it was
[1605.98s -> 1613.46s]  like this. You know what I mean? 1, 2, 3, 4, 1. I don't believe that for a second. This is definitely
[1613.46s -> 1629.10s]  the 4. If I'm wrong, that's fine. I'll be wrong. The 1 is up here somewhere. So if this is the 8,
[1629.82s -> 1654.14s]  3 is 1. Let's just say 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It could be that. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
[1654.14s -> 1672.58s]  8. But even if it's this, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It has to be right here. Right? You mean it's
[1672.58s -> 1689.94s]  right? That's wrong. Wait, hold on. If this is the 4, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Hold on a second.
[1689.94s -> 1709.40s]  I hope this is correct. Otherwise, this whole thing's fucked up. This is probably a 1. 1, 2,
[1709.40s -> 1718.74s]  3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. It could be over here. I need to get rid of this shit first. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[1719.70s -> 1727.16s]  Got more info to fill that. All right. Well, that's interesting because now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[1727.16s -> 1732.92s]  You have to assume here now this is the 1 and there's a 3. There's 5. Let's just make it.
[1732.92s -> 1738.68s]  Let's make it nice and simple on ourselves here. I either blew it or I didn't. It's pretty simple.
[1738.68s -> 1752.65s]  You know what I mean? This is probably wrong. But who knows? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[1754.10s -> 1760.52s]  I'm committing to have this being fucked up. We'll see. Yeah, it's all jacked up already.
[1762.81s -> 1773.74s]  Shit. No, I committed to it. I committed an initiative. Damn it. See how I screwed myself
[1773.74s -> 1787.85s]  here? This is the outlier right there. If that's the case, then this can't...
[1789.45s -> 1802.55s]  That's not the 5. No, the 5, man. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It's got to be a 1.
[1808.65s -> 1814.36s]  I blew it. It's all right. Sometimes you blow it. Damn it. I thought I had that one too.
[1815.08s -> 1835.24s]  Well, this is 13. I like when they give you a nice easy one. 2, 4, 7. Yeah, not enough spaces.
[1835.88s -> 1849.37s]  1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 2 somewhere up here. It all makes sense now. Thank you.
[1850.62s -> 1858.09s]  Now, wait a minute. This is... I can fill in a lot here because that's 15, 14, 13, 12.
[1858.97s -> 1867.18s]  Can I get at least... Let's just start with that. 10 is also... I can do a lot of these.
[1868.60s -> 1876.50s]  10, 10. Anything that's 10 can be filled in down to here and more than that. That was not a 10.
[1876.50s -> 1894.10s]  So this is a 10. Let's see. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3. Yoink. 1, 2, 3. Let's see. 9, 10, 11, 12.
[1897.93s -> 1912.52s]  Guess. Kim's Cookies. They're delicious. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 7, 8, 9. This is also part of the
[1912.52s -> 1930.65s]  9. Then 9. Speaking of 9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay. This is 6, 8. A lot of just big numbers
[1930.65s -> 1943.99s]  here. Well, there has to be a 2, so. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Space 2. There's the 2.
[1943.99s -> 1950.97s]  And then there it is. Let's hope that's correct. The 9. Part of the 2. There's the 2 again.
[1952.15s -> 1969.48s]  There's another 2. There's all the 3's. 1, 2, 3. Eh. Meh. 2, 3, 4, 5. That's gotta be
[1969.96s -> 1980.70s]  right there. What about down here? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Can't do anything with this.
[1981.42s -> 1988.89s]  Anyone know if I read the recommendations channel on Discord? I do. I do all the time.
[1989.53s -> 2005.00s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I do read it frequently. How many more left here? 1, 2, 3,
[2005.00s -> 2019.67s]  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I can do this. This is done now. 1, 2, 3. Get it out of here.
[2020.31s -> 2035.98s]  Ah. 3. 1, 2, 3, 9. That's it. 5. I think I know what this is. What do I? It's weird that this
[2035.98s -> 2050.92s]  is here. It looks like a heart. 7. Done. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This is done. Close that up.
[2056.50s -> 2060.82s]  I mean, there's no way it's there. That's like symmetrical, right? It has to be there.
[2061.38s -> 2069.22s]  That's it for that 10. Yeah, this is pretty much a done deal right now. So we've got that done.
[2075.48s -> 2085.02s]  I think I can just fill these both in. Yeah. There's the 6. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what?
[2085.66s -> 2092.17s]  What kind of heart is this though? Is it just a heart? What's with the top left?
[2095.40s -> 2109.37s]  Just a heart. Guess. Elephant. I feel nice and slowed down. I do like another a couple more.
[2109.37s -> 2117.30s]  Let's do like a few more. This is another one of those slightly harder ones, I think. 13, 14, 15.
[2117.78s -> 2124.38s]  Right down the middle there. Breathe, breathe. Let's see. Is this probably 1411 anymore?
[2125.02s -> 2137.94s]  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. A few more hours? No, I'm probably going to skedaddle here
[2137.94s -> 2148.15s]  in a little bit. I just wanted to wind down a little. Let's see. 8. You're already guessing
[2148.15s -> 2155.69s]  animals? How are you already guessing this? 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Nothing that's close to 15.
[2156.41s -> 2186.30s]  That's the only thing I can do is this one here. I think I can do that, right? Yeah, I can. 3,
[2187.77s -> 2198.55s]  2. No, this is definitely part of the 3. This is the 2, right? Yeah. Which then that makes this
[2198.55s -> 2213.38s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This is a 1. Part of the 8. Interesting. This game makes me irrationally angry.
[2214.10s -> 2222.07s]  I don't think that should be happening. I don't think that should be happening. I think you need
[2222.07s -> 2227.19s]  to calm down a little. I could probably pull this tooth out if I tried hard enough. Don't pull your
[2227.19s -> 2249.27s]  teeth out. Do not pull out your teeth, please. 2, 1. This is part of 3. This might be a 1.
[2250.58s -> 2262.44s]  If this is 1. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 1, 2. Okay. 1, 2,
[2262.44s -> 2268.44s]  3, 4. 1, 1. This could be the 4 here, although it's unlikely what it could be.
[2269.64s -> 2285.34s]  I'm gonna do it. Give me the pliers. No, sit down. Stop it. Give me the pliers.
[2285.98s -> 2316.81s]  Shit. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I don't know. I'm stuck. 7, 8, 9, 10. I'm stuck right now. 1, 2.
[2317.61s -> 2333.43s]  1, 2. Help me out here, guys. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[2334.15s -> 2355.45s]  I think I can get this. All right. I can get that. 2, 3. This is 3. 3, 3. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.
[2355.45s -> 2370.90s]  1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. This could be the 1. 1, and then 1, 2, 3. No, 1. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3. No,
[2370.90s -> 2380.66s]  it's not. This is definitely the 2. That one may cry 5 waiting room. We're not doing that tonight.
[2380.66s -> 2393.75s]  It sounds like I'm trying to count to 10, but I can't do it. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. I don't know.
[2396.74s -> 2413.16s]  Well, I can do something here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Something on the other side. 1, 2, 3, 4. 6, 7.
[2416.76s -> 2423.08s]  Holy shit, this is part of the 4. Really? 1, 2, 3, 4. Oh, I don't know. It could be any one of
[2423.08s -> 2442.10s]  those numbers after 8. This changes this up a little. So 6 is now able to be done a little
[2442.10s -> 2456.82s]  bit here. It's 8. Something like that. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. This is just counting. Yeah,
[2456.82s -> 2463.54s]  that freed up some space with 8 because look at this. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Look at
[2463.54s -> 2469.93s]  this. Okay, I'm just going to do it. I'm going to punch myself as hard as I can in the face.
[2481.46s -> 2492.33s]  Okay, this is meant to calm you down. That's right. It's supposed to just be chilling and
[2492.33s -> 2500.55s]  just shutting up and playing. I forgot. 1, 2, 3. Okay, I can get rid of this.
[2503.88s -> 2525.22s]  Doesn't help me for anything else though. Okay, that helps this though because if this is 3, then
[2525.86s -> 2534.97s]  I just figured that out. Smart guy. The question is, is this the 3? I don't know.
[2537.10s -> 2543.50s]  If this might be the 3, I think it is. I'm just going to say this. Now I can do the 4. 1, 2, 3.
[2544.38s -> 2553.82s]  Space. This has to be the 3 going up. Boing, boing. Please be right. I think it is.
[2564.52s -> 2586.07s]  It's a head scratcher at this point. 5, 2, 5, 6, 7. Can't do anything with that.
[2587.46s -> 2600.68s]  This 8 though. No. Remember to go to church this Sunday? If that's what you do, then yeah.
[2601.32s -> 2607.98s]  This is definitely part of that. That's it. Let's close that out of here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
[2607.98s -> 2636.63s]  8. Can I get 3 on both sides? I can. Nice. Yes. Oh, it feels great. 5, 3. This is awkward here.
[2636.63s -> 2648.74s]  So 1, 4, right? It's not 1, 2, 3, 4, 1. That's part of the 4. So that's the first
[2649.54s -> 2666.39s]  1. Okay, that looks good. There's the second 2. Okay, what else we got here?
[2669.93s -> 2680.15s]  Done. And then that makes... He's guessing? No, I don't know. That 4 had to be right there,
[2680.15s -> 2683.51s]  and then the ones had to place this way, and that gave me the 2, and that gave me the 4.
[2684.39s -> 2703.24s]  I'm not guessing on this one. 2, 1. That's definitely 1. That's also 1. Oh, fuck. Wait. Oh,
[2703.24s -> 2720.73s]  no. 3, 3. Whoa. I blew it. Oh, it was going so well. Oh, what did I do? I really wasn't
[2720.73s -> 2736.82s]  guessing though. This is not correct here. No. This is correct. I'm certain of that, but not here.
[2739.62s -> 2770.84s]  But there's no way this is correct. That's the 8, right? This is the 3. That's the only 3.
[2775.38s -> 2790.78s]  On this side at least, right? All right. Got it. Just uninstall it. No, wait. What do you mean? No.
[2790.78s -> 2815.43s]  No? Are you sure? Because that looks pretty close. That would make complete sense. Because before
[2815.43s -> 2828.02s]  I had it back here. Oh, wait. No, but what the fuck is going on here? Oh, no. Oh, this is the
[2828.02s -> 2834.82s]  worst when you... Oh, god damn it. No. The right 3 crosses, I guess? No, I didn't. I just... Because
[2834.90s -> 2867.08s]  this was empty. And I figured it had to be the 4. And it... Shit. No. No, this is supposed to
[2867.08s -> 2906.82s]  be making me happy. Let me see if I can fix this shit. How can I sleep with this pick-ross fail?
[2906.82s -> 2914.44s]  Well, there's no way it's these. Because this 4 can't fit in here. No, it's not down here either.
[2918.92s -> 2926.04s]  I might be too tired for this. And I do this while I'm tired. Oh, no. No, I had it too.
[2927.64s -> 2932.28s]  It's the same shit I was saying when I played Sekiro. No, no, I had it. I gotta restart. I gotta
[2932.28s -> 2951.32s]  redo it again from the beginning. Oh, fuck. I had it. This is correct. It is. Don't tell me it's
[2951.32s -> 2984.98s]  not. I know it is. It's wrong. Is this... This whole row can't... This can't be incorrect.
[2987.72s -> 3005.19s]  And looks like is... Is that what was just fucking me this whole time? No, but this is fucking wrong
[3005.19s -> 3017.38s]  though. You see, like 4, 1, 1 can't be here. It's... Something else is wrong. See what I'm saying?
[3017.38s -> 3037.45s]  Like, I think this whole thing is fucked up. Because this is supposed to be 2, 1, which...
[3039.42s -> 3050.65s]  Like, that's 2, 1, but... But then this 6, right? Like, there's no... How am I gonna get the 6 in
[3050.65s -> 3059.54s]  here? You know what I'm saying? There's no way. The 6 is not gonna fit in here. This whole thing is...
[3059.54s -> 3074.23s]  What is this? What nice animal. 3... Because look, see? Nope. Nope. This is 1. This is the only place
[3074.23s -> 3099.34s]  where it can start. 5 and then 2. 2 is already done here. This one's done. Or no, at least like
[3099.34s -> 3108.87s]  this part is. That's the 3, 5, 2. Where's the 1 go? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. See what's going on here?
[3109.67s -> 3163.96s]  This is all messed up. Look at this. We're gonna get a bigger problem down here. No. No.
[3163.96s -> 3186.18s]  Fuck. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I need one more. 6. But then this is fucking wrong. All these 5, these 2, 2,
[3186.18s -> 3190.02s]  2, 2. I got... This is all... I screwed up something like a couple times and it's just over.
[3198.31s -> 3201.43s]  Is it... I don't think there's something I can replace here to make this right.
[3201.43s -> 3209.54s]  Because the 13 has to... The 13 has to be here. You understand? The 5 is wrong then.
[3209.54s -> 3214.65s]  Because this has to be here. And then all this shit is wrong.
[3235.11s -> 3268.41s]  Get me out of here. Fuck it. Harder than Sekiro. I fucked it up. God damn it. I'm going to bed.
[3268.41s -> 3280.07s]  God damn it. I had it too. I was gonna relax. Yeah, this is relaxing me. My 40% capacity
[3280.07s -> 3312.39s]  brainpower right now is doing great. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Not enough to get a whole row.
[3312.39s -> 3333.21s]  I need to calm down from this stressful de-stress. Yeah. Hey, calm down and go play some Sekiro.
[3338.04s -> 3341.22s]  I actually probably should have just gone... I should have probably just ended the stream
[3341.22s -> 3355.88s]  an hour ago when I was already tired enough to go to bed. All right, let's see. 5 and then 1, 2,
[3361.77s -> 3376.18s]  3. That's... This is 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4. No, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay, that would... That makes sense.
[3388.06s -> 3396.42s]  He doesn't know how to count again. He's losing his mind. He beats Sekiro. Can't beat Picross.
[3397.91s -> 3412.10s]  No, I can. I can do it. I'm gonna like just go hold my head under water and then the bath
[3412.10s -> 3415.14s]  and like the bathtub that... No, no, no. Listen, listen. Like I'm talking about like
[3415.86s -> 3423.35s]  go take a bath. Go take a bath. Listen. I'm gonna go take a bath and just like relax and like put
[3423.35s -> 3426.95s]  my head under and then get the warmth and then come back out. You didn't let me finish.
[3427.67s -> 3435.93s]  That's not how you bathe. Yes, you do. You go back and like go under just for like two seconds
[3435.93s -> 3452.20s]  and then come out and you're... You baptize yourself. All right, we've got 8. So obviously
[3452.20s -> 3460.47s]  8 has to be here. So we got 1, 2, 3. Let's see. 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Pretty good.
[3462.52s -> 3470.22s]  That would make sense here. And then the 2 is down here somewhere because that's correct. Yeah,
[3470.22s -> 3485.35s]  it is. I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. 5, 5. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[3496.65s -> 3508.81s]  I can... It's probably the same thing. It's baptized. Yeah, I'm gonna go baptize myself
[3508.81s -> 3548.06s]  in like the warm cooling waters of the bathtub. Yeah, it's the cooling waters of the bath.
[3552.62s -> 3563.26s]  This is 4. In fact, I might just fucking flip the table over here in Monopoly and just go do it now.
[3563.26s -> 3587.18s]  I went into like the 15 by 15 P-Cross. Should have just did like the 10 by 10. Let me see.
[3590.89s -> 3615.72s]  3, 1. Do a 50 by 51 in a bath. I think... I honestly think Ishin might have dropped my IQ by like
[3615.72s -> 3633.86s]  8 points. I mean that permanently. To beat Sekiro, I had to drop my IQ by 10 points.
[3633.86s -> 3640.15s]  I used it all. You know how you have like... Okay, I used some life consumables.
[3640.15s -> 3646.55s]  Take 10 years or 10 points of IQ off life but gain 30 straight seconds of utter complete focus.
[3646.55s -> 3664.47s]  I used it. Perishables. He's activated checks too many times. Again, you guys know
[3665.03s -> 3670.15s]  in like fucking time travel movies and tv shows where they like their nose is bleeding and they
[3670.15s -> 3676.23s]  keep using the time travel and eventually they like they they go fucking like wacky. They've
[3676.23s -> 3681.80s]  lost their mind because they've done it too many times. I think I may have activated checks too
[3681.80s -> 3718.07s]  many times. This happens in click. Have fun. I'm gonna just relax. I use my back and time powers
[3718.07s -> 3730.81s]  too much. If you guys do this, I'll do another Minecraft VR stream. You have uh you have five
[3730.81s -> 3752.90s]  minutes. I don't know why that's making me laugh so hard. You have until uh 11 um you can't cheat
[3752.90s -> 3774.06s]  either. Yeah, I'm sorry. I've I got no brain power left. It's gone. I'm gonna admit when I,
[3774.06s -> 3787.30s]  you know, when I'm just gonna admit defeat when I have to. All of it's gone. Jeremy lied about
[3787.30s -> 3792.73s]  Minecraft VR. Five more community subs. You've been insane tonight with these community subs.
[3792.73s -> 3806.52s]  Thank you. You guys have to let's see eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen. I'll give you guys
[3806.52s -> 3822.76s]  until 15 minutes. No cheating. You have until the clock on the top right strikes 15. Restart the
[3822.76s -> 3837.18s]  board. That's not part of the deal. We ain't got no damn idea. No, some of you guys know what's
[3837.18s -> 3853.61s]  going on. Restart the board, fucker. Fine. Fine. I'll give that to you. But you just consumed uh
[3853.61s -> 3859.29s]  two of your brain cell minutes. So now you have five minutes to do it. You used your power.
[3859.85s -> 3888.71s]  Don't use it too many times. Alright, fine. You got until seven minutes. I'll give it back.
[3889.53s -> 3902.70s]  I cleared the board. You have seven minutes and then the stream's over. I gotta go take a break.
[3902.70s -> 3911.48s]  I gotta go take a shower. Eat some food. Good luck though guys. I really hope you hope you get it.
[3912.04s -> 3924.34s]  I promised Minecraft. Yeah, if you guys if you guys do this by the time it's seven minutes,
[3924.34s -> 3933.13s]  I will do another episode of Germacraft VR. I said seven minutes. I did make it six minutes.
[3933.13s -> 3953.29s]  I just gave you an extra minute. I'm not lying. Do it. Keep me honest. That's the thing. The 15
[3953.29s -> 3961.42s]  by 15s are like some some of them are very difficult. Most pit cross puzzles top out
[3962.06s -> 3968.30s]  at around 15 by 20, 20 by 20, 25 by 25 is really kind of pushing it for difficulty.
[3969.02s -> 3976.06s]  There are a lot, there are some pit cross puzzles that go more than 25 by 25 or 20 by 20 but they're
[3976.78s -> 3981.74s]  it's like doing a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle. At some point you're just like,
[3981.74s -> 3988.68s]  eh, I kind of wanted to do a quick one. 30 by 30s, yeah. They take a while though. They can take
[3988.68s -> 3998.92s]  upwards of like an hour. Especially some of the ones that are more than 30 to 40 or 40 by 40.
[3999.56s -> 4021.67s]  What are you all even trying to do? They're trying to make a full square and they do it every time.
[4023.64s -> 4041.11s]  40 by 40 is 1600 pieces. It's a lot, yeah. Takes a while. Is it 1600? No, it's not. Is it? How many
[4041.11s -> 4059.22s]  are here in 15 by 15? You guys have plenty of time to get this fixed but for those of you that are
[4059.22s -> 4062.66s]  sticking around, that's the end of the stream. Sekiro was really the only thing I wanted to
[4062.66s -> 4074.22s]  finish tonight. Yeah, it is 1600, yeah. You will see me again. We're gonna play Monster Rancher.
[4074.78s -> 4078.76s]  We're gonna start with Monster Rancher 4 and if it sucks we're gonna go back to Monster Rancher 2.
[4079.40s -> 4084.66s]  All the Sekiro people already left, yeah. I know. Thanks for sticking around, you guys.
[4084.66s -> 4097.72s]  Just sticking around in pit cross and watching me have another meltdown. Meltdown 2. Give us until
[4097.72s -> 4105.26s]  you finish reading bits. Okay, that's not like a fair assessment here. Let's see, how many bits
[4105.26s -> 4121.98s]  do we have? Okay, no, that's fair. I wish you luck. So, my journal lied about Minecraft VR. Five more
[4121.98s -> 4134.73s]  community subs. My god, thank you so much. So many community subs. Super seal, thanks for the 250.
[4134.73s -> 4139.21s]  Just letting you know there's going to be a temporary TF2 man versus machine update.
[4139.21s -> 4148.26s]  What do you mean temporary? Operation memes versus machines. Oh, nah.
[4149.06s -> 4152.66s]  All right, just the title alone is kind of like,
[4154.36s -> 4161.37s]  I don't know about that. That's on the official Team Fortress post, yeah. Memes versus machines.
[4164.20s -> 4172.41s]  Might be interesting, but maybe not. Who knows. But thank you super seal for the heads up there.
[4172.41s -> 4176.33s]  Sad Vega, thanks for the 250. Oh my god, Jeremy, you missed so much shit. No joke, you're gonna
[4176.33s -> 4180.09s]  have to play the whole game again. You should do as much as you can before you get to Junichiro
[4180.97s -> 4186.81s]  and fight him. Also, could you kill those poor castle grandmas? I did that parent
[4187.69s -> 4193.40s]  and didn't hurt a single one. I did that parent and didn't hurt a single one. They just cry
[4193.40s -> 4198.76s]  and curl into a ball if you look at them. You horrible monster. I feel like I did,
[4199.48s -> 4204.01s]  I missed a lot of shit, but yeah, but aren't there two or three different ways you can go through
[4204.01s -> 4211.08s]  the game? I was under the assumption that some of the choices I was making changed the whole game.
[4211.80s -> 4218.28s]  And you can't really go back and redo them, right? There's four, there's four endings.
[4219.00s -> 4230.07s]  And on a first playthrough, it's, you know, kind of just need to do it, you know. But thank you,
[4230.07s -> 4234.71s]  Sad Vega. Hole of one zombie, thanks for the five dolls. Kind of odd, but just wanted to say thanks
[4234.71s -> 4238.79s]  for reading my dumb comments. Before I watched your streams, I used to think up stupid shit to
[4238.79s -> 4244.73s]  make my friend laugh, but he passed from cancer. Your streams helped me laugh again and want to
[4244.81s -> 4249.29s]  make you laugh too, if that makes sense. Kind of depressing, but keep making people laugh.
[4252.07s -> 4264.68s]  I'm really, really fucking sorry to hear that. Making people laugh, telling jokes, and enjoying
[4264.68s -> 4271.21s]  experiences with people is one of my favorite things in the world. Having fun together is
[4272.33s -> 4281.98s]  my favorite thing on earth. I'm really, really terribly sorry to hear about that hole of one
[4281.98s -> 4298.01s]  zombie. I'm happy that you can hang out here and make jokes and give some joy to other people.
[4301.82s -> 4319.03s]  Thank you so much for the five dolls. How are you guys doing? Yeah, actually, I'm really doing
[4319.03s -> 4328.89s]  that bad. You're starting to get it. A Frodeon weapon, thanks to the five dolls, Frodeon. Superb
[4328.89s -> 4339.46s]  shinobi execution, term of checks. I think that was for the demon of hatred, but thank you,
[4339.46s -> 4342.90s]  Frodeon. And then say 250 from Frodeon again. You're doing a great job.
[4344.18s -> 4353.24s]  I'm trying, I'm trying. Sekiro was fun. Did you beat the final boss? Yes, I completed Sekiro.
[4353.24s -> 4358.50s]  It is done. Something or other, thanks to the 250. Hey Jerm, saw you at the bowling alley the
[4358.50s -> 4362.10s]  other day trying to get the bowling shoes over your regular clown shoes. I noticed that you
[4362.10s -> 4366.18s]  wouldn't, I noticed that you would let out a high-pitched scream whenever someone tried to
[4366.18s -> 4371.54s]  help, so I figured I'd offer a piece of advice now that I'm not with an earshot. Why not put the
[4371.54s -> 4376.74s]  bowling shoes on first, then put the clown shoes on over them, since the clown shoes are bigger?
[4376.74s -> 4383.08s]  Smiley face. That's a good tip. That's a really good tip. I'll probably check, I'll probably do
[4383.08s -> 4394.17s]  that next time in this imaginary scenario that you made up. $50, I missed this earlier. I was
[4394.17s -> 4399.53s]  really, really focused and intense and I missed a $50 donation. I don't know if you still hear fudge
[4399.69s -> 4407.27s]  44. It was 5,000 bits. I'm really sorry I didn't catch this when it first came through,
[4409.00s -> 4412.68s]  but I'm not sure if you still hear. Maybe not. I suppose it was about four hours ago, so
[4414.66s -> 4419.16s]  thank you regardless. They say, hey Jerm, I stumbled across your channel years ago when
[4419.16s -> 4427.64s]  you were playing Battlefield 3 with Pwnstar and have been a fan since. Now that is a long time ago.
[4427.64s -> 4431.59s]  Just want to say thanks for getting me into TF2 and volunteering at an elementary school.
[4432.31s -> 4436.47s]  Got inspired by your video on working at an animal shelter. About to finish university
[4436.47s -> 4440.39s]  and recently got my first job, so finally have the money to show my appreciation for all the
[4440.39s -> 4445.64s]  entertainment advice. Sorry it's taken so long for me to give something back. You already gave
[4445.64s -> 4454.34s]  something back by watching. The amount of people that watch these streams, collectively all of you,
[4454.34s -> 4459.27s]  have given me more than anything I could ever ask for in my life. Everything I've ever dreamed of.
[4460.82s -> 4469.42s]  Doing entertainment. Doing jokes and comedy and bits. That's the number one thing I've wanted in
[4469.42s -> 4477.46s]  my entire life and you've given it to me. That's worth way more than money. Thank you.
[4484.73s -> 4495.43s]  You guys just filled row A. Well you got a little bit more time. Hanging out and doing
[4495.43s -> 4500.82s]  broadcasting and doing videos and shit. Something I've always wanted to do. Thank you for letting
[4500.82s -> 4509.02s]  me fulfill my the goal of my whole entire existence. It's worth way more than a dollar.
[4512.26s -> 4517.94s]  Thank you. And when I say dollar I don't mean a dollar that you get 50. I'm talking about just
[4517.94s -> 4528.07s]  like the dollar. Thank you so much. Penguin thanks for the five dollars penguin. I would help you
[4528.07s -> 4536.47s]  Jerma but I have... this is like a thing with the streamer says the thing right? No is this? I don't
[4536.47s -> 4553.35s]  know. Lumbago? What is that? I've heard it. I would help you Jerma but I have Lumbago. Who says that?
[4553.43s -> 4566.31s]  Somebody says that. Oh it's from Red Dead. Right. I thought it was like the the other one.
[4566.87s -> 4569.83s]  Flank tank. Thanks for the three bucks flank tank. Are there going to be new emotes anytime
[4569.83s -> 4575.42s]  soon if you have any open slots or maybe a community emote vote part two? Yeah,
[4575.42s -> 4582.62s]  Sakura really has just taken up 100% of my time here. I haven't really had an opportunity and
[4582.62s -> 4589.02s]  I'm sick too. I spent a couple days last week sick so I haven't really been focusing on it
[4589.82s -> 4597.64s]  but yes there's gonna be a lot of new shit soon. Soon soon soon. But thank you flank tank.
[4600.86s -> 4608.70s]  D Jack thanks for the 250. Well done Sekiro. Well done. I got through it. Tingy thanks for the 250.
[4608.70s -> 4616.23s]  Is this the guy who beat Sekiro on stream? It is not. As of the end of this broadcast, yes it is.
[4616.23s -> 4625.94s]  It is not. We get to say that now. Thank you Tingy. Thank you Have Gun for the 250. I was there when
[4625.94s -> 4642.42s]  Jerma defeated grandpa and became his own man. You guys again with the A. Some people just want
[4642.42s -> 4651.26s]  to watch the world burn. That's the scenario there. Smelly Boy thanks for the 250. I hate that clip
[4651.26s -> 4663.78s]  it. I wonder what you were referring to. But thank you Iron Dude for the five dollars. Congrats Jerma.
[4663.78s -> 4671.70s]  Thank you. Thank you so much for the five dollars Iron Dude. Clueless Sniper thanks for 250. Hey
[4671.70s -> 4685.21s]  Jerma now that you've beaten Sekiro what are your favorite from bosses? Ludwig is number one
[4685.21s -> 4691.29s]  always. I don't think any boss in this game topped how I felt when I played Ludwig for the first time.
[4694.79s -> 4700.55s]  The fountainhead dragon was really really awesome. Scale wise probably the biggest boss they've done
[4700.55s -> 4707.56s]  which was just awesome to see. Really really interesting design. That's probably the up there
[4707.56s -> 4718.33s]  for like coolest looking and most interesting art direction wise. I'm trying to think if I would put
[4718.33s -> 4726.79s]  any I'm trying to think of before. It's hard to remember like every boss from the whole this
[4727.35s -> 4737.59s]  like 150 bosses across this whole company's lineup here. Who's my favorite? Let me just think about
[4737.59s -> 4743.62s]  my favorite bosses from the whole series in general. Dark Souls one. My favorite boss from
[4743.70s -> 4752.92s]  Dark Souls or my favorite boss from Demon's Souls was probably the last fight. That was a lot of fun.
[4755.38s -> 4758.98s]  Fighting against the guy with the sword that dashed around and he was really really cool.
[4758.98s -> 4771.85s]  I forget what his name was. I think in Sekiro the first fight against Genichiro was maybe my
[4771.85s -> 4784.39s]  favorite. Now that I have a chance to sit here and think about it. No no no not the not the
[4784.39s -> 4788.31s]  tutorial one. I'm talking about like the first when you beat him then he like falls over the
[4788.31s -> 4796.07s]  balcony. Just that fight was just really really fun. It felt very fluid. Old King Alant is that
[4796.07s -> 4805.66s]  boss from Demon's Souls. Yeah that was definitely one of my favorites. Dark Souls two. I feel like
[4805.66s -> 4814.44s]  there was a boss every 30 minutes in Dark Souls two so it's hard to remember. Who was my favorite
[4814.44s -> 4835.08s]  boss from Dark Souls two? I don't know. Maybe not necessarily favorite fight but the guy that the
[4835.08s -> 4839.56s]  two people that were back to back that were connected that would fold on top of each other
[4839.56s -> 4845.16s]  and you'd fight one and then they would do like a little cartwheel. I don't know if I liked that
[4845.16s -> 4853.98s]  fight but I liked that how that boss looked. They had the two scimitars. The sentry yeah.
[4855.42s -> 4866.01s]  That was just a really interesting mechanic in regards to just how it looks and how cool it was.
[4867.78s -> 4881.35s]  Dark Souls three is uh honestly probably Pontiff. I just love his animations. They're so cool.
[4881.35s -> 4893.82s]  He was just so fun to watch. His the two blades that he has were just and oh no Gale. Gale was
[4893.82s -> 4897.98s]  unbelievable. That oh man that's tricky. That might be one of my favorite. That's my favorite
[4897.98s -> 4910.14s]  fight like ever huh. Gale yeah Gale Ludwig I think are still higher than anything from Sekiro for me.
[4916.89s -> 4925.27s]  Sekiro was more about fighting other people for the most part. There wasn't there was a couple of
[4925.43s -> 4930.15s]  extravagant ridiculous enemies but for the most part the major enemies in Sekiro are
[4930.87s -> 4937.06s]  I'm also a guy and I've got a sword too. So it's hard to make the comparison between like Gale
[4937.94s -> 4950.09s]  or Ludwig versus something like Owl. It's kind of just your dad. Fight wise they were brilliant
[4950.89s -> 4958.18s]  but I guess it's it's hard to overcome the way that I felt when when you get to phase three of
[4958.18s -> 4966.47s]  Gale. It's just it's so everything it just clicks everything looks so interesting.
[4967.27s -> 4971.67s]  He has a really really cool move set. I don't know it would be tough between Gale and uh
[4971.67s -> 4987.05s]  and Ludwig. They're all good. Most of the Sekiro bosses were dudes with swords. Kind of had to be
[4987.05s -> 4993.37s]  like that though because in a game that's based around parrying deflecting and you know posture
[4993.37s -> 4999.10s]  and sword play you did they really then they tried you know they came like the ape the giant
[4999.10s -> 5006.50s]  ape was sword and he was stabbing and they did do a good job with that but you kind of have to
[5006.50s -> 5024.58s]  have it be a game about sword play and then you move on to Bloodborne and Bloodborne is just
[5024.58s -> 5032.86s]  is a perfect video game. There's so many bosses. I have such fond memories of a shitload of those
[5032.86s -> 5042.46s]  bosses. The research facility is one of my favorite zones in any video game. Drip drop drip drop like
[5042.46s -> 5048.58s]  that place was fucking crazy. I loved that place. I wish I could just play Bloodborne 2.
[5057.32s -> 5065.54s]  The DLC in Bloodborne was the best DLC that From Software has ever made. Regardless of a copy and
[5065.54s -> 5072.71s]  paste couple of boss fights the DLC was the best they've done ever. It was perfect. Well not perfect
[5072.71s -> 5080.76s]  because I just told you that they you know this they copy pasted a boss or two. We'll see if they
[5080.76s -> 5085.00s]  come up with some DLC for this game because they've been pretty on point with it so far the last like
[5085.00s -> 5093.78s]  five years. Lady Maria was just absolutely phenomenal. Ludwig absolutely fucking phenomenal.
[5097.05s -> 5108.39s]  Yeah I want to like go back and play it again. Orphan was next level almost like the yeah what
[5108.39s -> 5121.38s]  a great game. I still hold it to a higher regard than Sekiro. Sekiro is pretty close though. I
[5121.38s -> 5129.13s]  think Sekiro is better than Dark Souls 3 just as an entire the whole package. It's tough.
[5129.85s -> 5136.54s]  Ah the memories. But hopefully that answers your question.
[5138.07s -> 5142.71s]  Sad Vega thanks for the 250. Congratulations on getting the bad end. I hope you do better next
[5142.71s -> 5153.85s]  time. Oh man wait till you see the actual final boss. Congratulations on the bad end. Nioh is
[5153.85s -> 5159.61s]  better than all of them. I just okay I'm gonna be here's a confession here. Yes I play oh dude
[5159.61s -> 5167.16s]  go back to Nioh. You know you were just like shitfaced. You would like it. Offstream I like
[5167.16s -> 5178.49s]  a year ago or so I did try to just play Nioh off stream. I just I didn't like it. I was I just
[5178.49s -> 5192.26s]  didn't it didn't click. I don't know what it was about it. The gameplay is fun. The environment's
[5192.26s -> 5201.40s]  interesting. I just something about it was not clicking with me. Nioh looks lame compared to
[5201.40s -> 5210.87s]  Sekiro. They had a really uh the way your character moved around is I think what I had the biggest
[5210.87s -> 5219.32s]  problem with in Nioh. Like the way that the dodges worked and it was just it felt very
[5220.20s -> 5237.10s]  um it's hard to describe. You guys did it. Look you made a bow and arrow. But thank you sad
[5237.10s -> 5241.82s]  mega. Thank you Dubski dude for the 250. You are a gaming god. My heart was pounding during that
[5241.82s -> 5246.38s]  last stretch. Didn't think you were gonna make it. Neither did I. This game wasn't made for human
[5246.38s -> 5250.38s]  beings but you beat it. Have my bit so I can finally say that I gave a sweaty internet goblin
[5250.38s -> 5258.15s]  a hundred dollars in total. You deserve it. Thank you. Thank you Dubski dude. I didn't think I was
[5258.15s -> 5272.81s]  gonna make it either. I had so much self-doubt going into half of those attempts. 52 attempts.
[5273.75s -> 5281.08s]  Dear god. I guarantee I can tell you how like 38 of them went. Oh my god.
[5282.28s -> 5287.96s]  Fuck no. Just redo it. Ready? Let's let's turn let's turn the audio off. I want you to like
[5287.96s -> 5295.72s]  maybe somebody like just super they can pose me over. Ready? Here is absolutely at least
[5295.80s -> 5308.86s]  15 to 20 of those attempts. Now I'm just gonna go. I'm gonna try it. Okay. Fucking god damn it.
[5308.86s -> 5319.18s]  It's just fucking insane. It's it's just insane. I don't want to do this part. Oh my fucking god.
[5319.18s -> 5326.79s]  Jesus christ. Always hits me with that bullshit. Yeah that's a good one. Always hits me with that
[5326.79s -> 5337.91s]  bullshit. I forgot about that one. What a stupid fucking mechanic. Honestly why? Why? I'm so close
[5337.91s -> 5354.41s]  to the wall. There's nothing I could even do. Someone just said I came I just came back. What?
[5363.34s -> 5376.07s]  But impose me. Ready? Oh my god. No. No. No. Fucking my god. Oh my fucking god.
[5377.78s -> 5383.00s]  Give me a fucking break. I probably said that four or five hundred times in the last three hours of
[5383.00s -> 5394.22s]  the stream. He's raging at stuff that doesn't exist in Picross. Is this guy like on fucking drugs?
[5399.94s -> 5404.82s]  Hey PikaBanana thanks for 30 bucks. 30 dollars from PikaBanana. Congrats Jerma. I'm so glad I
[5404.82s -> 5409.85s]  could watch you beat the game live. It was so much fun to watch. Thanks for sticking around. Thanks
[5409.85s -> 5416.31s]  for hanging out. I know some of these new games that have a lot of hype behind them. A lot of
[5416.31s -> 5420.15s]  people maybe don't want to see just because they're playing on planet themselves. So those of you that
[5420.15s -> 5425.13s]  have really stuck around the whole time. I hope you enjoyed it. Thanks for hanging out the whole
[5425.13s -> 5430.17s]  time. Well for you know however long you were here. Thank you for the 30 dollars PikaBanana.
[5430.17s -> 5434.63s]  Appreciate it. Zero giblets thanks for three bucks. You did great Jerma. Thanks for the stream. I have
[5434.63s -> 5440.30s]  to ask what is your new scale of favorites for from games? You mentioned favorite bosses. Thanks
[5440.30s -> 5454.22s]  again. You ready? Here we go. Dark Souls 2 at the bottom. But this is going up right? I would say
[5454.22s -> 5466.78s]  Dark Souls 2. I'm not gonna make a lot of people upset about with this but Dark Souls 2. Dark
[5466.78s -> 5482.63s]  Souls 1. No no no no. Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 1. Sekiro. Demon's Souls. Bloodborne.
[5482.63s -> 5505.35s]  There you go. Done. In that like order going up. I loved that. I love Demon's Souls. Yeah Demon's
[5505.35s -> 5517.34s]  Souls is that high. I just I loved it. Do it again but this time coherent. Okay Dark Souls 2.
[5520.94s -> 5529.77s]  Then Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 1. Sekiro. Demon's Souls. Bloodborne. The thing about
[5530.25s -> 5537.85s]  you could probably. Sekiro could probably overtake Demon's Souls. I mean I just did play
[5537.85s -> 5551.38s]  Demon's Souls. I mean I did. Well actually I did like last year. Here look. Oh here you go. I'll
[5551.38s -> 5575.29s]  write it out. Here we go. I'll hear you. Official. I would probably say Demon's Souls and Sekiro
[5575.29s -> 5605.50s]  probably equal for me right now. What am I lagging for? Okay here we go. Ready? He's typing really
[5605.50s -> 5619.32s]  slow. You guys didn't even come close. Let me see. 29 minutes and this is shit you guys have.
[5621.94s -> 5627.64s]  There you go. I fixed it. 30 minutes are gone. That's it. Guess what? I'll give you a consolation
[5627.64s -> 5655.58s]  prize. I'll play Minecraft VR again. Not as long this time. Oh no you know I'll watch a Minecraft
[5655.58s -> 5672.68s]  video. I'll watch a Minecraft related video. Today? No not today. Thank you Tingy for the 250.

[5686.62s -> 5697.82s]  Look at this. Let's see how. Wow what happened on March 26th? Honest to god look at that. I was on
[5697.82s -> 5706.52s]  point on the 26th apparently. I must have had my fucking vitamins. What was what what bosses what
[5706.52s -> 5718.62s]  areas were the 26th? Was it the ape? I would expect that would be way less. I mean way more.
[5721.48s -> 5729.59s]  That's cool though. 63 52 of them were the final boss. German lied about Minecraft VR. Another
[5729.59s -> 5735.85s]  five community subs. You are uh what are you at now? 115 total in the channel. You've given 115
[5735.85s -> 5746.79s]  community subs. Thank you German lied about Minecraft VR. That's a lot. But thank you Tingy
[5747.91s -> 5755.58s]  for the 250 and for keeping track. You and Jess you got it. It's cool to see it. D Jack thanks for
[5755.58s -> 5762.31s]  the 250. So quick first impression. The game's not even fun. It's like the least amount of fun
[5762.31s -> 5774.42s]  I've ever had. Thank you though. Thank you Wavelet for the four dollars and 20 cents. Congrats on
[5774.42s -> 5778.26s]  beating the game. German the last boss fight. Stage three with no healing pots or Rez's left was
[5778.26s -> 5799.78s]  intense. Pog. Yeah oh I'm just I'm just remembering that fight. It's a lot. It's a lot of fun. Thank
[5799.78s -> 5808.89s]  you snooze and copter for the 250. Uh have I seen this video? This video. Yeah this is this is the
[5808.89s -> 5815.58s]  German Defoe one with the painting. You know some people say it looks like me. Yeah I watched it on
[5815.58s -> 5823.13s]  stream before here. We have seen this one. And then they said uh I was curious how you and Kim met.
[5825.10s -> 5835.98s]  How did you get to know each other? Uh we met at a Christmas party and then I we just started
[5835.98s -> 5844.90s]  texting. We like we hooked up at the Christmas party right. So it was already kind of like oh
[5844.90s -> 5851.38s]  okay like I will talk again. We started texting back and forth and then it was like hey come over
[5851.70s -> 5866.82s]  you want to come over? Yeah we watched like fucking Iron Chef for three hours and that was it. Boring
[5866.82s -> 5882.12s]  lore. What do you mean boring lore? Yeah you got everyone. Jeremiah I got like what you got any like
[5882.12s -> 5888.28s]  tips like relationship tips or you know how do I know what what what give me some tips give me
[5888.28s -> 5895.86s]  some secrets on how to get food network shows. Iron Chef. Hell's Kitchen. Kitchen Nightmares.
[5898.02s -> 5904.65s]  There is no better thing to watch when you're on a date. You want to know why? Because it never
[5904.65s -> 5910.30s]  fucking ends and you don't you don't have to think of the awkward moment where oh let's watch this
[5910.30s -> 5916.95s]  movie. An hour and 30 minutes went by it's over. Oh fuck now what the hell am I gonna do? What the
[5916.95s -> 5925.11s]  hell are we gonna talk about? There's like 6,000 episodes of Iron Chef across regions of the earth.
[5925.11s -> 5930.15s]  There's like 2,000 Japanese episodes and then they ported it to America and there's like 3,000
[5930.15s -> 5935.35s]  American episodes. You can just leave it on and just figure out what you're gonna how you're gonna
[5935.35s -> 5945.50s]  what you're gonna do. Well then she'll go I gotta go now it's getting late. Yeah but like you you
[5945.50s -> 5950.86s]  had you have so many opportunities to like talk and it's not just like the the movie ends or the
[5950.86s -> 5957.51s]  tv show ends. Everybody expects when you look when you go into it you turn on Iron Chef you're not
[5957.51s -> 5963.11s]  just gonna watch one episode. That's not how it works. You're gonna watch at least eight otherwise
[5963.11s -> 5974.49s]  you're not gonna watch it at all. So you know you know what you're getting into. Nobody goes
[5974.49s -> 5981.82s]  hey yeah like Iron Chef oh yeah that sounds like a cool idea one episode done. That's I'm done. No
[5981.82s -> 5990.68s]  it would be weird if you were to turn that off after two episodes telling you Iron Chef. And
[5990.68s -> 5994.52s]  there's plenty to talk about there's so many interesting things and food and and wow he
[5994.52s -> 6000.52s]  burnt the chicken oh my god he burnt hey Kim he burnt the chicken can you believe it? No I can't
[6000.52s -> 6005.40s]  he burnt I know it's unbelievable. He's gonna get points deducted from that you can't do that during
[6005.40s -> 6014.50s]  a movie. Try doing that during a movie. He just got shot in the chest Kim he got shot in the chest
[6014.50s -> 6019.46s]  Kim yeah he got shot yeah oh he just like John Wick just punched that guy did you see John Wick
[6019.46s -> 6024.10s]  yeah John Wick just like threw him across the bridge yeah. No you're gonna sit there quiet
[6024.10s -> 6033.30s]  awkward and silent. You can do full-on commentary during a Food Network show. This is an NPC
[6033.30s -> 6049.83s]  conversation. That's my biggest relationship tip Iron Chef that's all I gotta say. Hey we've got
[6049.83s -> 6054.47s]  your earlier rigid parallel thanks for the five dolls yeah the one that has 21 hours in
[6054.47s -> 6062.25s]  PictoPix is a fantastic little game there's so many different versions. Jerma goes on dates and
[6062.25s -> 6069.08s]  talks like an oblivion NPC. No I'll just give an example and look my brain is tired so they're
[6069.08s -> 6077.85s]  gonna be very very basic simple examples. All right we're almost done. Thank you to Garfield
[6077.85s -> 6082.33s]  the Monday Killer for the 250. Been a while since I've made a comic for you. Let's get this on here
[6082.89s -> 6088.47s]  There's more stuff. Been a while since I made a comic for you Jerma the Worm. I had a dream the
[6088.47s -> 6094.39s]  mammoth from Ice Age was trying to kill me inside an insane asylum. First of all don't eat before
[6094.39s -> 6098.31s]  you go to bed because that's why that happened. The only way out was to grab an egg spinning on
[6098.31s -> 6106.15s]  a metal saw blade. Have you ever had a dream like that? Ever had deja vu before? Hey I'm Garf I'm
[6106.15s -> 6110.95s]  not so Garf and where are the game Garfs? Yeah Jerma you said that yesterday you're losing your
[6110.95s -> 6118.57s]  marbles man. Odie called the doctor I don't think Jerma's feeling. Stop you violated the law you
[6118.57s -> 6130.42s]  burnt the chicken. I burnt the chicken you burnt the chicken. God damn it. Yeah don't eat like
[6130.42s -> 6134.18s]  fucking three slices of pepperoni pizza before you go to bed that's why you're having weird dreams.
[6134.18s -> 6155.11s]  I'm serious look it up. I just did that. Don't. I'm gonna do that now why? No don't eat eating
[6155.11s -> 6163.78s]  right before bed fucks with you. It does. Yes somebody just said it. But thank you Garfield
[6163.78s -> 6170.86s]  for the 250. Thank you Garfield the Monday killer. Bingo Sunshine thanks for the five bucks. The AI
[6171.74s -> 6177.34s]  the AL is a boring mess this year. Do you think the Brewers can win the most competitive division
[6177.34s -> 6184.47s]  in baseball and take it all? Fuck the Pats lol. Red Sox are gonna win again. The Red Sox are gonna
[6184.47s -> 6201.69s]  win 154 games. Hey Mast Herman thanks for the 10 dollars. Thank you so much. I've been hoping to
[6201.69s -> 6209.88s]  show you the movie I made inspired by Rat Movie. Oh it's Mast Hero Man not Mast Herman like the
[6209.88s -> 6222.41s]  Pee Wee Herman superhero. I'm sorry. There's no capitals on Streamlabs. I've tried to explain
[6222.41s -> 6230.01s]  this before but there are no capitals on Streamlabs so you M the H and the M they're
[6230.01s -> 6241.61s]  they're not capitalized so it's Mast Herman. I'm sorry. Yeah by the way why the fuck is there are
[6241.61s -> 6249.70s]  there no capitals on Streamlabs? I have no idea why that is. Why have I botched so many names?
[6254.26s -> 6263.22s]  That's so odd. I'm just thinking about this now. How odd that is. Mast Herman. But for real thank
[6263.22s -> 6268.63s]  you so much Hero Man for the 10 bucks. You made a rat movie and a movie inspired by a rat movie.
[6269.83s -> 6277.45s]  When you got it done give it a link. Why do I support Boston teams? It's I think it's this
[6277.45s -> 6284.33s]  weird scenario where I grew up on the east coast and grew up in Boston in the 30 years of my life.
[6284.33s -> 6288.33s]  Something like that. I don't know. It's weird how that you you know you rip the team that's closest
[6288.33s -> 6295.06s]  to you somehow. I'm I don't know. It's weird. How does that how that works? Vegas gets a baseball
[6295.06s -> 6305.72s]  team. I'll be a Vegas baseball fan and they win. That's what are you talking about? You're from
[6305.72s -> 6312.84s]  Massachusetts. You spent 30 plus years in Massachusetts and the Massachusetts based teams win all the
[6312.84s -> 6328.58s]  fucking time. Why are you a fan of the Boston area teams? Why wouldn't I be? You have to admit that
[6328.58s -> 6337.72s]  Boston fans are the worst in the country. Why would I do that? Red Sox Nation. Red Sox Nation
[6339.00s -> 6356.81s]  representing here. Duncan. Red Sox. Duncan. Red Sox. Duncan. Red Sox. I just had that's pretty
[6356.81s -> 6364.02s]  much five out of ten conversations you'll have in downtown Boston. Hey Duncan. Yeah yeah it's a
[6364.02s -> 6376.09s]  launch. Red Sox. Yeah. Hey Duncan. Duncan Sox. You got it. That's how fucking like deals are made
[6376.09s -> 6379.93s]  over here. When they're building buildings in Boston that's how they that's what they do. They
[6379.93s -> 6389.14s]  oops. Oh yeah I'm from out of town. I'm from Wisconsin. I'm here on a contract duty.
[6389.14s -> 6395.46s]  I was just wondering how tall we're going to be making the floors here. I heard maybe 15 or 16
[6395.46s -> 6406.20s]  stories high. Which one is it? Sox. 17. Okay. Now what about the uh how many doors are we going to
[6406.20s -> 6410.76s]  have? I heard we're going to have two doors double doors on the front and then single doors in the
[6410.76s -> 6417.54s]  back. Red Sox Nation. Okay so we're going to have two uh thank you for the clarification. Two double
[6417.54s -> 6435.45s]  doors in the front and one in the back. That's how it works. Hey Jack. Thank you Jack for the 250.
[6435.45s -> 6443.19s]  What's your favorite game you played in 2019? Resident Evil 2. Probably. We're talking about
[6443.19s -> 6454.71s]  games that released in 2019. Sekiro is definitely up there but Resident Evil 2 probably. It'd be
[6454.71s -> 6463.69s]  close because Sekiro was great. Hey have gone thanks for the 250. Hey Jeremy. It was fun
[6463.69s -> 6467.29s]  watching you play Sekiro but I was disappointed that you didn't take the Japanese voices
[6468.01s -> 6472.81s]  a spin. I saw Kraken play with the Japanese voices and it made the game feel like a Kurosawa film.
[6472.81s -> 6476.73s]  Plus the Japanese voice actors have more consistent pronunciations of the names.
[6476.73s -> 6480.01s]  My favorite boss fight to watch was Isshin. What was your favorite boss battle?
[6480.73s -> 6487.69s]  The first fight with Genichiro or the fight with Owl? Probably my favorites. Um I was supposed to
[6487.69s -> 6492.81s]  turn on the Japanese voice acting after the first like 40 minutes of the game. I'm just realizing
[6492.81s -> 6517.90s]  this now. Whoops. This. All right it's all right. The owl fight was pretty boring looking. I just
[6517.90s -> 6525.42s]  liked the the flow of that fight. The horse guy was fun too. The Genichiro fight was the best I
[6525.42s -> 6532.30s]  think. That second phase was just so interesting for the first time seeing that with the lightning.
[6532.30s -> 6540.07s]  Like that's he's the first person that you understand that with you know. And it's a really
[6540.07s -> 6546.14s]  interesting mechanic. Doesn't feel bad. It feels fun to do. But thank you have gone. Thank you
[6546.14s -> 6551.66s]  Gondor Lane for the 250. A few days ago Jerma I actually had a dream of you. More dreams about
[6551.66s -> 6555.26s]  hopefully this is not about like people like putting you in like a torture room or something
[6555.26s -> 6559.34s]  like the other one was. In the dream I was just browsing Twitch and I just saw you streaming and
[6559.34s -> 6564.46s]  saw that it said you were playing Sam and Max. I got so unbelievably excited then I woke up
[6565.26s -> 6571.02s]  and my heart sank. You were playing my favorite game. It's suggested often in the discord too.
[6571.02s -> 6574.46s]  Make us happy Jerma. It's a perfect wind down puzzle game although it's lengthy so you might
[6574.46s -> 6584.02s]  want to save it for a good weekend. All right I gotta I can tell you every time somebody brings
[6584.02s -> 6595.48s]  up Sam and Max at least a handful of people at least go don't do it. What's going on here?
[6595.48s -> 6603.40s]  What's going on here? You just said you don't Gondor Lane just said don't do it. You just told
[6603.40s -> 6614.94s]  me that you had a dream about me playing it. What do you and you want what? Why did you say don't do
[6614.94s -> 6625.61s]  it? Don't you want me to do this? It is on a list. It is just one of those games that's probably
[6625.61s -> 6633.94s]  gonna be chill on his hangout. It was his nightmare. Oh I see right but I can't give you any
[6634.58s -> 6641.30s]  reason why it's gonna start or what it would happen or when. Just know that it is it is on a list.
[6642.02s -> 6655.21s]  It's on a notepad. It's just the stars need to align but love of god don't do it. But thank you
[6655.21s -> 6661.05s]  I appreciate the enthusiasm and appreciate the dream. Why I mean you hated that dream. You got
[6661.05s -> 6668.98s]  like upset about that dream. I shouldn't be happy about that dream but thank you. George McCaw thanks
[6668.98s -> 6673.22s]  for the 250. You're really good at these games but it's still fun to make fun of you losing.
[6674.50s -> 6689.78s]  I love everything you do bud. Nice RP here by the way. What? Nice RP? Oh I gotta get like
[6689.78s -> 6698.28s]  PictoPix out of here. The PictoPix was playing over. All right this is nice RP. Let's see what
[6698.28s -> 6729.43s]  they mean by this. Where is it? Where is it? Come on say it. Say it. I didn't even. Here we go.
[6730.07s -> 6734.23s]  I didn't even have it. No he was gonna say it. He was gonna say it. He was gonna do it.
[6739.13s -> 6750.78s]  You are so dramatic. He was gonna say I wouldn't even ready or I didn't even have the right thing
[6750.78s -> 6762.63s]  equipped or I should have the hitbox was so big you're gonna hear at least one of them.
[6762.63s -> 6766.78s]  Fuck this guy. I'm gonna go watch German at A5. There's dirt in my controller. Yeah this is
[6766.78s -> 6770.94s]  disgusting. It really is. Get a list of all the things I've said and how many times I've said
[6770.94s -> 6778.52s]  them. It'd be embarrassing for me to see it. You want to like embarrass me on stream? Pick out all
[6778.52s -> 6783.40s]  the times that I said something like that and count them. It would probably be the same audio
[6783.40s -> 6797.32s]  clip like fucking 50 times and it would be an embarrassment. Hey Tingy thanks for the 250.
[6797.32s -> 6800.52s]  This is the best Iron Chef icebreaker. It's called beer.
[6807.02s -> 6808.62s]  This guy like does like flips and shit.
[6828.10s -> 6834.82s]  You gotta okay give give him credit to do a big elaborate like this is the thing that I'm revealing
[6834.90s -> 6846.60s]  right beer is one syllable beer beer it's got to be longer beer that's how I would do it I would
[6846.60s -> 6865.03s]  go beer today's secret ingredient is beer I do you know the line uh thank you masked hero man for
[6865.03s -> 6870.30s]  the ten dollars just a few minutes ago here's a link straight from Herman's mind Herman's mind
[6870.30s -> 6899.40s]  what the hell is this oh this is a 3d movie maker
[6901.61s -> 6913.51s]  I'm surprised people can even get this to run this up you guys there's a 21 minute video holy
[6913.51s -> 6924.25s]  shit how long did this take you to make I remember when I went through 3d movie maker
[6928.01s -> 6932.65s]  I would have to restart and do different clips and do and pull it different segments because after
[6932.65s -> 6946.82s]  like five minutes of actually in the editor the thing would break down you just don't need to
[6946.82s -> 6952.42s]  stream yourself making rat movie three oh no that would be no it just takes too long it takes me so
[6952.42s -> 6968.31s]  long to do that shit I don't think anyone would want to really see that but thank you masked hero
[6968.31s -> 6986.22s]  man it took four days that it all on stream well that would be fucking I can't imagine how crazy
[6986.22s -> 6994.66s]  that would be and do I have trans parents of my planets I don't I really don't it's just the
[6994.66s -> 7000.66s]  emotes it's the emotes that are just blown up I don't have like high quality uh trans parents of
[7000.66s -> 7016.17s]  them that would be your most popular stream what a bad practice but it's more authentic that way
[7018.82s -> 7026.82s]  when Ashley did the shirt she actually like re-drew it and used the emotes too as references and tried
[7026.82s -> 7038.09s]  to copy them and stuff there was like a couple of different versions she's very talented let's just
[7038.09s -> 7044.54s]  put it that way uh let's get the credits up here these are all the subs tonight there were a lot of
[7044.54s -> 7051.86s]  gifted subs thank you everybody for sticking around we got two or three more bits to get

[7123.43s -> 7128.81s]  the 250 I was just watching kitchen nightmares today and I realized I have a new respect for
[7128.81s -> 7134.41s]  Gordon because he just shoves his hand in the grossest food and kitchen grime and just says
[7134.49s -> 7142.04s]  what the fuck is this while his hand is coated in two-week-old oil and rotten chicken wild stuff
[7142.04s -> 7153.58s]  yeah that is kind of yeah that's crazy he eats this food too in kitchen nightmares he'll just
[7153.58s -> 7156.94s]  sit there at the beginning and be like oh like yeah what yeah give me the crab cakes and he'll
[7156.94s -> 7160.70s]  eat them even if he knows that the place is about to shut down because it's disgusting
[7164.54s -> 7169.18s]  didn't he quit kitchen nightmares because he kept getting sick from the food that would be crazy if
[7169.18s -> 7179.82s]  that was true I don't know if that's true that's ridiculous but thank you for the 250 Jess Garfield
[7179.82s -> 7184.86s]  the monday killer coming in right here 250 German what do you think you're doing man you skipped my
[7184.86s -> 7189.50s]  comic you know how much time I spend in the writing room developing this don't you remember my links
[7189.50s -> 7195.70s]  don't stink when Garf has ever when has Garf ever led you astray now read the comic where I'm unsubbing
[7195.70s -> 7206.06s]  can you even unsub on twitch I don't know let's take a look hey German if I were to die today how
[7206.06s -> 7212.65s]  would you feel he's dead we finally killed him I can live in peace reality is often disappointing
[7212.65s -> 7222.94s]  though is it can't get rid of me that easy that emote is so bad do you see what that looks like

[7300.66s -> 7306.50s]  composite yourself into the vr games really easily and looks awesome works best with a green screen
