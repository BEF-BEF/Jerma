[0.95s -> 6.07s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, but
[6.63s -> 12.57s]  this is not going to really be a commentary on the gameplay. I'll tell you what the game is though.
[12.57s -> 17.61s]  It's an engineer gameplay with the Frontier Justice and the Mini-Sentry with the pistol,
[17.61s -> 23.61s]  and it's a one-life gameplay, the best one-life gameplay I've ever recorded. It's also going to
[23.61s -> 28.97s]  be on Turbine, CTF Turbine. Capture the Flag, this is like the first Capture the Flag gameplay I've
[28.97s -> 36.22s]  ever had. But the reason why I made this video is, if you can tell by the title, this is my 100th
[36.22s -> 41.90s]  upload to YouTube. Kind of a monumental thing for me. It's a big deal in general, 100 uploads,
[41.90s -> 47.74s]  that's a lot of uploads. I know a lot of guys that have like a thousand uploads, but obviously
[47.74s -> 53.50s]  they had their 100 upload at some point as well. And mine, this is going to be kind of a personal,
[53.50s -> 58.78s]  very personal video, not only to thank the people that watch and support this channel,
[58.78s -> 67.30s]  but it's going to be a history of how I got here and why you should absolutely never give up on
[67.30s -> 74.38s]  something because you have no idea what's actually going to happen. So let me rewind for a minute or
[74.38s -> 79.82s]  two here and let's go back to, at least in my case, I graduated college with a bachelor's in
[79.82s -> 85.83s]  communications. I went to school for five years, I was on the five-year plan. I was kind of a slacker
[85.83s -> 91.43s]  in college, not really a slacker. I just, I've had this problem with authority my whole life,
[91.43s -> 96.07s]  not like police, not like, oh, I broke the law a lot of times. I've just had this problem with
[96.07s -> 101.11s]  doing work when I'm supposed to and getting things done on time. I've had a problem with that my whole
[101.11s -> 106.06s]  life. That video, I could talk about that for six years, but that's for another day.
[107.66s -> 117.40s]  So I graduated college in 09, I got back and I did absolutely nothing. I was one of those people
[117.56s -> 120.92s]  that, oh, I'm going to be a director, I want to be an editor, I want to be a filmmaker,
[121.56s -> 125.48s]  and I never did anything about it. I didn't do anything. The only thing I ever did is I did
[125.48s -> 131.88s]  wedding videos, I did freelance music videos and stuff like that, but I never really pushed for
[131.88s -> 138.68s]  anything. So fast forward a couple of years, it is now 2011, almost 2012 I know, but as of recording
[138.68s -> 145.50s]  this video, it is 2011 and I decided to make a YouTube channel. I had a YouTube channel before
[145.50s -> 150.78s]  this, but that was for just random stupid stuff, random little skits and stuff like that. Nothing
[150.78s -> 155.74s]  really important, nothing I really wanted to push for, but this channel, this German 985 channel,
[155.74s -> 161.43s]  is only about six, six and a half months old. In June of this past year, I made this channel
[161.43s -> 165.51s]  because I looked around, I watched, I was a big gaming guy anyways, I watched all these gaming
[165.51s -> 170.47s]  channels and I said, you know, I want to try that. I just wanted to see if I could do it.
[170.47s -> 174.87s]  That was the number one reason why I did this channel to begin with. I wanted to see if I could
[174.87s -> 179.83s]  even do it. If I had the equipment, if I had the capabilities, if I could actually talk for a few
[179.83s -> 184.86s]  minutes in a row without freaking out. So I made two videos, they're still on this channel, it's
[184.86s -> 191.32s]  the spy and the medic one. I made those in the same day and I uploaded them and after probably
[191.32s -> 197.96s]  three or four hours, I took them down and I deleted the channel. Because in my opinion, I said,
[199.00s -> 203.88s]  I'm 26 years old, why am I doing this? This is, this is like a waste of my time. I'm too old to
[203.88s -> 207.80s]  be doing this. I need to figure something else out. I got to do something. I can't spend my time
[207.80s -> 213.37s]  on this. I can't do it. I cannot do it. So a couple of days go by and I sat on it for a little while.
[213.37s -> 218.25s]  I said, okay, I'm not bringing it back. No reason to. It's just, I can't do it. Like I said before,
[218.25s -> 223.62s]  I cannot do it. I talked to a friend of mine and this is what I'm going to relay to you guys.
[223.62s -> 229.06s]  Because if I did not talk to this friend about this certain problem, this certain little issue,
[229.62s -> 233.70s]  this channel would not exist. This channel would never have existed and it's one of the
[233.78s -> 239.46s]  reasons why I made this video for my 100 uploads because I brought the channel back after talking
[239.46s -> 245.86s]  to a friend of mine because he told me, he said, look, if you're going to go for something,
[245.86s -> 251.06s]  you have to go for it. And that's something that really rang in my head because he's true.
[251.06s -> 257.40s]  What he said was true. If you want to do something, you have to do it. You can't just put like 5%
[257.40s -> 261.00s]  effort into it and say, you know, I'm whatever. I don't care. If you want to take something
[261.00s -> 266.36s]  seriously, you have to just go for it. You have to do it. And that was my problem for so long.
[266.36s -> 273.48s]  I never put effort into anything. I just did it to do it or I just talked about it or I just
[273.48s -> 277.56s]  told people about certain things that I wanted to do. I never really went for it. I never did it.
[277.56s -> 281.58s]  And now when you fast forward, after I reactivated, I put a lot of effort into it,
[281.58s -> 287.70s]  really tried to go as hard as I could at it. I'm a machinima director. I have 10,000 subscribers,
[287.70s -> 293.94s]  which is unbelievable to me. It's unbelievable, guys. It's really ridiculous. I can't even
[293.94s -> 300.44s]  imagine that there's 10,000 people that have wanted to listen to what I had to say. And every
[300.44s -> 308.30s]  day, every day I say this is unbelievable. And I appreciate and respect every single one of you.
[308.30s -> 314.30s]  And that's why I made this video because this is the 10,000 subscriber 100 upload video. I wanted
[314.30s -> 318.54s]  to give you guys a personal story. And what I have to say to you guys, if you ever want to
[318.54s -> 323.32s]  do anything, if you ever want to start anything, you want to get into something, whether that be
[323.32s -> 330.92s]  sports, whether that be YouTube, whether that be drama, music, go for it. Don't sit around like I
[330.92s -> 337.88s]  did for years contemplating what to do, how to start something. Just start it and really,
[337.88s -> 343.45s]  really go for it. So that's kind of the message of this video. Sorry if I rambled a little bit,
[343.45s -> 347.85s]  but I wanted this video to be at least special to the people that have followed this channel for
[347.85s -> 354.09s]  a while and even the new people. It's just an insight into, I guess, my life and where I've
[354.09s -> 359.37s]  come. I don't typically do videos like this, but every once in a while I will to give you guys a
[359.37s -> 365.37s]  little insight on at least my life and how I go about things and how I did things. And not a whole
[365.37s -> 369.69s]  lot of people knew about the whole channel deletion thing. And I wanted to get that out there because
[369.69s -> 375.86s]  it's been a hundred uploads now and I thank you guys every day for that and that's crazy.
[375.86s -> 379.46s]  But I'll get into the gameplay now. There's maybe another minute and a half. I just want to talk
[379.46s -> 384.87s]  about this one live gameplay and what actually is happening right now. So if you see where I keep
[384.87s -> 390.15s]  placing that sentry, this is on Turbine. Turbine is a unbelievable place to play Combat Engineer.
[390.15s -> 395.19s]  If you want to play Combat Engie, do it on Turbine because that little spot right back here,
[395.19s -> 399.43s]  that's a spy obviously, but right back here behind everybody, see I have my dispenser right
[399.43s -> 404.07s]  there, but right to the right. That is the best place for a mini sentry because there's only one
[404.07s -> 409.51s]  place they can come out. They can only come out of these two doors or up top. So your mini sentry is
[409.51s -> 414.17s]  guaranteed to shoot at somebody. And once that happens, you're pretty much going to get an
[414.17s -> 419.13s]  assist. At least once every couple minutes you'll get one assist, at least. So you can kind of just
[419.13s -> 424.09s]  hang out outside the door after you destroy the sentry and wait for some dude to come out and
[424.09s -> 429.19s]  then plow him in the face with a shotgun shot. Another great place for a mini sentry is right
[429.19s -> 434.07s]  where I just put it, right behind those big warehouse storage box things. Because what
[434.07s -> 437.43s]  that does, that allows you to hide it for long enough because someone's going to come out there
[437.43s -> 442.97s]  and not see a mini sentry, walk right by it and all of a sudden and they're going to be like,
[442.97s -> 448.33s]  oh my god, which is going to get you a kill or an assist. So that's going to be the end of this
[448.33s -> 452.25s]  gameplay. I come around the corner and I get myself killed by a pyro, but this is like one
[452.25s -> 456.50s]  of the best one live gameplays I ever recorded. So I wanted to make sure I got it out there.
[456.50s -> 460.74s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And thank you so much for
[460.74s -> 467.14s]  10,000 subscribers, guys. It's awesome. 100 uploads, let's shoot for 10 million uploads,
[467.14s -> 472.73s]  right? I will see you guys all next time and take care, everybody.
