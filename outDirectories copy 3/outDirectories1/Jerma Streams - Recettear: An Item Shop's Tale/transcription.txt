[15.48s -> 60.66s]  Uh, this is, uh, this is the game. It's not quite ready to start yet. Um, this is a game where you play, you run an item store, and you have to sell and trade products, and over the course of that time try to make as much money as possible to, um, I have no idea what this is.
[60.66s -> 70.14s]  I was told that this is a fun game. I can't skip this. Why can I no longer skip this?
[71.63s -> 103.09s]  Oh, hi, there we go. Hey everybody! Uh, hold on, I'm not ready yet. Just pretend I wasn't here. Okay, that's better. I actually did not mean to show you that, but I did.
[103.09s -> 110.97s]  Accident? No, I don't- why is this popping up? This is all- my stream deck is so wrong right now.
[110.97s -> 118.21s]  I better not fuck around with this, because if I turn the camera on, it's gonna be embarrassing. So, I'm just gonna do it by hand, manually.
[118.21s -> 130.34s]  Alright. Yeah, we're gonna play, uh, Recettear, and Item Shops Tales is something that people thought I would like.
[130.34s -> 139.79s]  It's about trading stocks, and, um, going on adventures with your friends, and you know how I love the markets.
[139.79s -> 159.66s]  Did I say it? Wait a minute, did I say it? What are you linking me? What is this?
[161.66s -> 168.26s]  What the fuck is this?
[169.26s -> 186.79s]  What- what is this? That's a real ad. No, it's not. Somebody- one of you, like, meme aficionados doctored that shit. That's real.
[186.79s -> 206.55s]  Let me say it again, hold on. I'm- no, stop- this is so loud! Where is it? Why do I have a porn ad?
[208.56s -> 214.15s]  Somebody link it.
[216.61s -> 221.61s]  What is this implying? Is this implying that I'm chatting with this girl, or is she watching me?
[222.61s -> 236.18s]  Am I the porn, or are they the porn? I don't understand. Why this clip? Where did you get this gift from?
[237.18s -> 244.95s]  I'm the chatter? Turn this off.
[250.03s -> 256.36s]  I gotta- hold on, this is important. Why? Where did you find this?
[256.36s -> 262.18s]  Acting like he doesn't know.
[267.20s -> 268.20s]  What?
[268.20s -> 276.63s]  Alright, well that's fucking weird. I don't know what webs- don't go to this website, because they're probably just gonna, like, take your data.
[276.63s -> 289.89s]  I would be careful of that, like, data bait, so I don't know what that is. I don't endorse that website. I'm not part of that website.
[289.89s -> 296.47s]  Make sure you don't have your credit card on a notepad on your computer if you click on that link, okay?
[297.47s -> 310.21s]  Anyways, that's fucking odd, but- and of all the things, that's like- why wouldn't you take- I'm laughing!
[311.21s -> 321.84s]  I'm, like, laughing at that person. You don't, like, laugh at porn. You don't know- what? Is it porn, or is it just, like, a chat with me thing?
[324.42s -> 330.03s]  What do you mean you don't? That's so fucking funny.
[331.03s -> 334.03s]  What do I even do about that, though? That's the thing, right?
[334.03s -> 340.00s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do about that? Go get a lawyer?
[340.00s -> 350.65s]  Oh, hey, yes, this is Dick and Dick Associates. Hey, yeah, it's me, German985. Just put a call in. Somebody's using my face in a porn ad.
[350.65s -> 354.66s]  Do you know what company it is? I have no idea. They might be overseas.
[354.66s -> 357.28s]  Do you have any idea who it is?
[357.28s -> 360.28s]  No, I have absolutely no clue. Somebody linked it to me in chat.
[360.28s -> 369.65s]  Okay, um, you know, you're probably better off just- I gotta take another call.
[369.65s -> 373.36s]  You wanna sue him? Yeah!
[373.36s -> 378.30s]  Give me the person's name, where they're located, and what the business or country is located in.
[378.30s -> 387.10s]  Can't give you any of that. They're using my likeness to sell chatting software.
[388.10s -> 399.18s]  Unbelievable. It's me, like, of all the videos to pull.
[399.18s -> 404.67s]  Why wouldn't you pull one of me talking as if I was talking to you guys?
[404.67s -> 408.81s]  You know, like we sit here with the face cam on and I just talk?
[410.05s -> 415.74s]  Why would you take the one of me laughing at a baby running into a wall over and over again?
[415.74s -> 419.74s]  I've talked to the camera like a thousand times before.
[419.74s -> 423.04s]  I don't- whatever. We sit here.
[423.04s -> 426.04s]  An item shop's tail. This is what we're doing today.
[426.04s -> 432.38s]  Hope you had a good Fourth of July. Those of you that celebrated.
[432.38s -> 434.38s]  We don't need to hear the theme song again.
[434.38s -> 438.38s]  Alright, so this should be fun. It's a game about buying stocks.
[438.38s -> 440.38s]  I'm like stuck on repeat right now.
[440.38s -> 449.44s]  New game. Here we go. Can I skip all this?
[449.44s -> 451.44s]  Are you guys gonna be mad if I skip the whole thing?
[451.44s -> 458.09s]  Oh, for the love of- she's still asleep. No. No, yes. Don't skip it. Skip it.
[459.58s -> 462.58s]  Why is this Sesame Street music?
[462.58s -> 471.74s]  Alright, I- I'm gonna just- we're gonna do it normally.
[471.74s -> 482.94s]  I'm not gonna skip. That was a pretty good fucking fat cloud.
[482.94s -> 486.50s]  Does she really not understand how important today is?
[486.50s -> 489.50s]  I'm in bed? Why am I under the covers like that?
[489.50s -> 494.76s]  Merple. Can't eat another bite. That's my name. My name is Resetti.
[494.76s -> 497.83s]  Resiti. Is it Reset?
[497.83s -> 505.30s]  But I can always find room for yummy candy.
[505.30s -> 507.30s]  Mimble-werble.
[509.75s -> 514.75s]  I've heard of like, mmm, or like, er, or, uh, Mimble-werble.
[516.95s -> 519.95s]  Oh, I'm so tired this morning. Mimble-werble.
[519.95s -> 528.74s]  Wake up, please. Is that me?
[530.88s -> 532.88s]  Whoa, whoa, what is it?
[532.88s -> 537.91s]  Oh, Tier. Good- good morning.
[537.91s -> 541.92s]  We do not have time for good morning, Resetti.
[541.92s -> 546.16s]  Are you planning on spending the rest of your life dreaming of sweets?
[546.16s -> 550.16s]  Today is the day we set for opening the store. I'm so- I'm way too excited for this.
[550.16s -> 554.30s]  Uh, we did? Oh, yeah, we did.
[554.30s -> 557.58s]  Merde.
[557.58s -> 560.40s]  Zero F all the-
[560.40s -> 563.40s]  Listen, go wash your face and make yourself presentable.
[563.40s -> 566.40s]  And then join me downstairs in the storefront.
[566.40s -> 573.87s]  Okay, I'll be right down.
[573.87s -> 575.87s]  Hey, sorry, I kept you waiting.
[575.87s -> 581.99s]  Okay, Tier, let's open the shop right now.
[581.99s -> 583.99s]  Capitalism ho.
[583.99s -> 587.74s]  Patience, Resetti. It is a virtue you will need.
[587.74s -> 592.46s]  We need to take care of a few matters before we open officially.
[592.46s -> 596.46s]  Everybody settle down for a second, because this game is like actually fun, I've heard.
[596.46s -> 603.23s]  Well, I somehow doubt that a store without anything to sell is going to attract all that much business.
[603.23s -> 609.27s]  Oh. Oh, yeah, we don't have anything to sell.
[609.27s -> 611.27s]  So, what do we do?
[611.27s -> 616.71s]  To start with, we need to establish a stock of items for the store.
[616.71s -> 621.72s]  If we have nothing to sell, we cannot claim to be much of a shop.
[621.72s -> 624.72s]  That's true. Hmm, so where should we go to get stocked up?
[624.72s -> 627.41s]  Let's go get like, liquor.
[627.41s -> 632.41s]  The best way, I think, would be to visit either the town market or the merchant's guild.
[632.41s -> 635.41s]  We need to give our regards to the head of the guild regardless.
[635.41s -> 637.41s]  So that should probably be our first stop.
[637.41s -> 640.80s]  Constant capitalism.
[640.80s -> 644.30s]  Oh, that's the place to run by that old guy, right?
[644.30s -> 648.30s]  We got an old guy. Can't let you do the old guy voice.
[648.30s -> 651.30s]  You know it's coming. I can't wait to do it.
[651.30s -> 654.30s]  The guild operates as a wholesaler for local merchants.
[654.30s -> 657.30s]  So if we stop by, we can purchase an initial stock.
[657.30s -> 660.30s]  It would not hurt Grover.
[660.30s -> 662.30s]  It would not hurt Grover.
[662.30s -> 666.86s]  Give up, give our polite regards to the guild chief either.
[666.86s -> 671.17s]  Especially since the guild is the organization that allows us to operate here in the first place.
[671.17s -> 673.17s]  Why does everybody have a guild?
[673.17s -> 676.30s]  Monster Ranch here, we gotta, there's a guild.
[676.30s -> 679.18s]  The rest of the tier, guild.
[679.18s -> 684.62s]  Who cares about the guild?
[684.62s -> 686.62s]  Okay, got it. Then let's go right now.
[686.62s -> 689.62s]  Hold on, that person's like, why is that person floating off the ground?
[689.62s -> 694.93s]  When you want to leave the shop, head to the front door currently located in the upper right hand corner of the store.
[694.93s -> 698.62s]  But I wanted to leave through the window like an action hero.
[698.62s -> 701.05s]  To infinity.
[701.05s -> 705.05s]  And beyond. They didn't want to get in trouble for that apparently.
[705.05s -> 706.05s]  Why?
[706.05s -> 707.93s]  Brassetti!
[707.93s -> 709.93s]  Okay, fine.
[709.93s -> 719.18s]  Oh, it's because it actually is, it's like a fairy or something.
[719.18s -> 721.18s]  Alright, so here's my store.
[721.18s -> 722.18s]  So we have to leave.
[722.18s -> 724.18s]  You didn't think there was going to be any action in this game.
[724.18s -> 728.13s]  You didn't think there was going to be any fucking running T-poses in this game, did you?
[728.13s -> 732.52s]  I know it's the easiest thing I could, alright, there's a lot to do here.
[732.52s -> 736.98s]  Alright, so we need to go to the merchant's guild.
[736.98s -> 738.98s]  This action will not take any time.
[738.98s -> 741.98s]  We have 1,000 picks.
[741.98s -> 744.50s]  Pictures of what?
[744.50s -> 751.19s]  Here comes the old guy.
[751.19s -> 760.86s]  A girl and a fairy, you two, yes, you're Brassetti and that Lone Shark.
[760.86s -> 764.49s]  I get to do an old person voice. I get to do an old man voice.
[764.49s -> 767.49s]  Well, that is not, well, an incorrect assessment.
[767.49s -> 770.49s]  Could I ask that you refrain from calling me Lone Shark?
[770.49s -> 773.69s]  That's right, mister.
[773.69s -> 776.31s]  She and I are partners, don't be mean.
[776.31s -> 781.92s]  Forgive me, forgive me, partners it is.
[781.92s -> 786.61s]  So, how are the preparations for running that shop coming along?
[786.61s -> 788.36s]  Quite well, thank you.
[788.36s -> 793.36s]  In fact, we plan on opening today, so we stopped by in order to show our gratitude for your help.
[793.36s -> 797.60s]  Very good, you two know what you want.
[797.60s -> 801.16s]  If you have any problems, let me know, I'll be glad to help.
[801.16s -> 803.16s]  We appreciate your kindness, thank you.
[803.16s -> 805.72s]  I wish you a starting monster.
[805.72s -> 808.02s]  He'll grow up to be big and strong.
[808.02s -> 810.02s]  We appreciate your kindness, thank you, bye.
[810.02s -> 815.14s]  Not a problem at all, what are we going to buy from here?
[815.14s -> 818.14s]  So you came straight here to pick up some merchandise, right?
[818.14s -> 821.96s]  Well, up to the counter then, let's get you two sorted.
[821.96s -> 824.33s]  Are those two cigars on him? What is that?
[824.33s -> 826.33s]  He's got two cigar holders?
[826.33s -> 829.51s]  What's on his chest there?
[829.51s -> 831.51s]  Are those clothespins? I'm not sure what those are.
[831.51s -> 835.39s]  Those are pens, those are fat fucking pens.
[835.39s -> 839.78s]  Those are extra large Sharpies.
[839.78s -> 841.78s]  Those are not pens.
[841.78s -> 846.71s]  Is that first time?
[846.71s -> 848.71s]  Alright, I gotta pay attention to this.
[848.71s -> 850.71s]  Our funds are limited, so do not go completely overboard.
[850.71s -> 852.71s]  I recommend purchasing no more than ten items.
[852.71s -> 858.45s]  Buy, sell, talk.
[858.45s -> 860.94s]  Alright, so we need to stock up.
[861.94s -> 864.76s]  A worn out dented chipped sword.
[864.76s -> 867.76s]  Still better than going into the wild bare handed though.
[867.76s -> 870.77s]  140.
[870.77s -> 872.77s]  A standard lightweight long sword.
[872.77s -> 874.77s]  Perfect for novices learning the art of swordplay.
[874.77s -> 876.77s]  It's 840 bucks.
[876.77s -> 887.65s]  Alright, I just gotta...
[887.65s -> 889.65s]  Oh shit, there's more.
[889.65s -> 891.65s]  We have one item.
[891.65s -> 893.65s]  I didn't know there was more bars.
[893.65s -> 895.65s]  Hold on, how much are these?
[895.65s -> 898.46s]  I recommend ten items.
[898.46s -> 902.11s]  Oh.
[902.11s -> 904.11s]  Why can't I just lie about what the sword is?
[904.11s -> 906.11s]  That's how capitalism works.
[906.11s -> 909.11s]  I'm just gonna make up a story about why this thing is worth so much money.
[909.11s -> 917.03s]  Rusty dagger.
[917.03s -> 920.10s]  I can't even...
[920.10s -> 922.41s]  We can have two items. Leather gloves.
[922.41s -> 938.71s]  Wait, hold on, clothes.
[938.71s -> 941.78s]  Can I sell anything?
[941.78s -> 943.78s]  Sell it back to him?
[943.78s -> 945.78s]  Hey, we're running our item store here.
[945.78s -> 950.46s]  360.
[950.46s -> 955.32s]  This guy probably thinks we're like fucking morons.
[955.32s -> 957.32s]  What is the guild? What can I do here?
[957.32s -> 959.56s]  About merchant levels.
[959.56s -> 961.56s]  Merchant level is, well, your ability as a merchant.
[961.56s -> 965.56s]  As it goes up, you'll figure out how to redecorate or even expand your store.
[965.56s -> 972.25s]  Heck, you might even be able to convince me to let you have a look at some of our more premium items.
[972.25s -> 974.25s]  So they got drugs behind the counter.
[974.25s -> 979.49s]  You don't put your hands up and say premium with your fingers like that.
[979.49s -> 981.49s]  Unless it's something fucking illegal.
[981.49s -> 983.49s]  So...
[983.49s -> 985.49s]  How do you raise your level? Simple. Buy, sell, trade.
[985.49s -> 987.49s]  This is an art and you learn by doing.
[987.49s -> 989.66s]  If there's anything you don't know, just ask.
[989.66s -> 992.42s]  Okay.
[992.42s -> 994.78s]  Let's go sell it.
[994.78s -> 1000.98s]  Let's go sell that sword.
[1000.98s -> 1002.98s]  Aw, but unknown items.
[1002.98s -> 1006.98s]  Now if you go dungeon diving, you'll find a lot of stuff which you won't be able to identify at first.
[1006.98s -> 1014.98s]  In particular, I'll bet my hat, you'll find a lot of what are commonly called mystery ingredients by the adventurers.
[1014.98s -> 1016.98s]  You can go dungeon diving.
[1016.98s -> 1023.15s]  At first you'll probably be tearing your hair out over all the junk you keep finding in those places.
[1023.15s -> 1030.15s]  But as your merchant level goes up, you'll be able to sort out the stuff you find and pick the best materials and whatnot from the lot.
[1030.15s -> 1035.15s]  Oh, and if you manage to get out of these death traps safely, you'll have time to identify everything safely.
[1035.15s -> 1038.15s]  That means you won't know what you're carrying till you leave.
[1038.15s -> 1040.15s]  Huh, that's interesting.
[1040.15s -> 1043.16s]  Alright, well let's go. Let's get out of here.
[1043.16s -> 1045.46s]  I got my merchandise.
[1045.46s -> 1047.77s]  Right then, will that be all?
[1047.77s -> 1050.26s]  Yep, this is perfect.
[1050.26s -> 1052.26s]  We shall return when our stocks run low again.
[1052.26s -> 1055.53s]  Haha, I'm looking forward to it.
[1055.53s -> 1058.53s]  Here, a little something extra as a start-up gift.
[1058.53s -> 1062.56s]  Bread from the ground.
[1062.56s -> 1065.56s]  Half of a donut. Walnut bread, thanks a bunch.
[1065.56s -> 1069.40s]  Alright little lady, give them your all.
[1069.40s -> 1072.86s]  Capitalism, ho.
[1072.86s -> 1076.48s]  Well, Adam Sandler would be proud of us at any rate.
[1076.48s -> 1081.02s]  Alright, we're gonna go back to recetteer.
[1081.02s -> 1090.34s]  Very well, it's time to give you a crash course on the basics of running an item shop.
[1090.34s -> 1092.34s]  I am so excited and I don't know why.
[1092.34s -> 1094.34s]  I was supposed to just relax today.
[1094.34s -> 1096.34s]  Okay, what do I do first?
[1096.34s -> 1098.34s]  First, we need to put some items on display.
[1098.34s -> 1101.34s]  We do not have our goods out for people to see.
[1101.34s -> 1104.34s]  We can hardly expect the customers to buy them after all.
[1104.34s -> 1107.98s]  Just need to get near these counters.
[1107.98s -> 1111.42s]  Just so, once you know where you wish to place something,
[1111.42s -> 1114.42s]  choose what you wish to place in that spot by pressing the primary button.
[1114.42s -> 1118.42s]  Primary button?
[1118.42s -> 1120.66s]  You will understand when you try it, trust me.
[1120.66s -> 1124.66s]  Now remember, what you place will affect how people perceive the store.
[1124.66s -> 1126.66s]  So think carefully before you place something.
[1126.66s -> 1132.80s]  Okay, why not line up what we purchased on one of the counters?
[1132.80s -> 1141.41s]  Okay, so I have longsword and clothes.
[1141.41s -> 1143.41s]  Longsword has to be right here.
[1143.41s -> 1147.29s]  Base price, 1200 bucks.
[1147.29s -> 1151.58s]  That's the item that people are gonna be coming in.
[1151.58s -> 1153.58s]  And that's the one that lags your game.
[1153.58s -> 1158.72s]  Alright, then how about maybe in the back wall here?
[1158.72s -> 1162.66s]  Do it by the window.
[1162.66s -> 1166.22s]  No, I don't want to sell the bread.
[1166.22s -> 1172.70s]  I'm already getting talked to.
[1172.70s -> 1176.20s]  May I speak with you a moment?
[1176.20s -> 1178.44s]  What is it? What?
[1178.44s -> 1183.44s]  Those counters by the window, items you place there are visible to anyone passing by on the street.
[1183.44s -> 1187.68s]  As such, putting eye-catching items, the sort of thing that makes you think,
[1187.68s -> 1192.68s]  I want to buy this more than anything, on those counters is a core principle of running a shop.
[1192.68s -> 1196.68s]  In a very real way, those counters are the face of the shop.
[1196.68s -> 1200.68s]  And what is placed there greatly affects interest in our business.
[1200.68s -> 1206.05s]  So choose what to place there very, very carefully.
[1206.05s -> 1209.05s]  Wow, I never thought about like that before.
[1209.05s -> 1211.05s]  Hokkai, I'll be careful.
[1211.05s -> 1224.37s]  So then, how do I pick it up?
[1224.37s -> 1226.37s]  I'm gonna put, oh, she likes the sword.
[1226.37s -> 1228.37s]  Look, you can use that sword to cut that bread.
[1228.37s -> 1232.77s]  I got it up here.
[1232.77s -> 1234.77s]  I'll put the clothes over here.
[1234.77s -> 1241.02s]  This is a window.
[1241.02s -> 1243.02s]  Can I talk to you for a minute?
[1243.02s -> 1247.46s]  You probably shouldn't cough near the bread.
[1247.46s -> 1251.46s]  I mean, you can, but we're gonna have to put a mask on you.
[1251.46s -> 1258.08s]  Are you sure it doesn't look dumb?
[1258.08s -> 1261.08s]  Do not worry, everything looks good. Enough for a first attack.
[1261.08s -> 1264.32s]  Now I need to teach you how to actually sell things.
[1264.32s -> 1266.32s]  Please go sit at the counter.
[1266.32s -> 1273.21s]  Oh, you're talking to me. You're talking about me.
[1273.21s -> 1276.05s]  Here they come.
[1276.05s -> 1282.42s]  Well, then the items are in place and now you need to learn how to actually sell things to people without embarrassing yourself.
[1282.42s -> 1286.42s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[1286.42s -> 1289.42s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[1289.42s -> 1294.54s]  Super Mario 3D World!
[1294.54s -> 1295.98s]  Alright, right.
[1295.98s -> 1297.98s]  Actually, sell things.
[1297.98s -> 1302.78s]  Hokkai, oh!
[1302.78s -> 1309.64s]  So to start with, I will lecture on the actual process of selling an item we have displayed.
[1309.64s -> 1315.64s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[1315.64s -> 1319.95s]  I can't pay attention.
[1319.95s -> 1321.32s]  Alright.
[1321.32s -> 1326.89s]  if the students do not listen they do not get any credit right right right now then when a customer
[1326.89s -> 1337.88s]  enters be sure to greet them with a nice big welcome uh welcome greeting the customer helps
[1337.88s -> 1342.84s]  them feel comfortable and relaxed while in the store their comfort is fundamental to our business
[1342.84s -> 1346.52s]  remember that as we continue now a typical customer will find an item they want on our
[1346.52s -> 1353.00s]  display and then they will come over to the counter to pay for it let me demonstrate could
[1353.00s -> 1365.19s]  i get this please um um um i don't know let me think about that i i i'm a store and i have things
[1365.19s -> 1370.95s]  that people pay me to give them i don't know what they want will be in the target window
[1373.13s -> 1379.10s]  you will also be able to see the name and the base price pay close attention to that base price
[1380.26s -> 1384.58s]  also if you press button three you can view expanded it well i don't what's that on
[1384.74s -> 1395.70s]  xbox consult the custom dot exe program included with resit here if you wish to check or alter
[1395.70s -> 1404.97s]  your button configuration wait button three custom dot exe focus your life is hard enough to
[1404.97s -> 1410.68s]  control as it is uh okay now the next you must decide what price you wish to offer
[1411.24s -> 1415.72s]  in general you want to try and name a price higher than the base try naming a price if
[1415.72s -> 1423.58s]  you will uh let's see you likely notice that the base price serves as your default
[1423.58s -> 1432.57s]  to raise your offer press up press up okay is this an android learning how to do things as a
[1432.57s -> 1447.86s]  pro i don't understand that's not gonna happen all right let's do uh 116 percent of base price
[1447.86s -> 1448.50s]  1500
[1468.04s -> 1490.04s]  is that gonna work a fair price oh what oh oh shit i get how do i get this off um
[1490.04s -> 1509.93s]  i can't put that on zero there we are i got i gotta get it i'll only need just one person
[1509.93s -> 1525.21s]  to buy that and i'll be good okay i'm gonna say uh 1350 very good that is how you adjust
[1525.21s -> 1532.89s]  your offer this might be obvious if a customer is satisfied with your offer it is a sale and
[1532.89s -> 1538.47s]  you get a little bit of experience along with the money if your price is too high however
[1538.47s -> 1543.11s]  a customer can simply walk out learning to determine the proper price there lies the
[1543.11s -> 1547.35s]  challenge now if a customer disagrees with the price but not so much that they want to
[1547.35s -> 1553.00s]  storm out then you can negotiate remember what i said about comfort earlier and that is the
[1553.00s -> 1557.32s]  key here offer price but do not make it so outrageous that the customer feels you were not
[1557.32s -> 1564.52s]  acting in good faith 112 is fine so if they disagree but stay offer them a new price
[1564.52s -> 1568.92s]  ideally you will lower your offer a little and they will take it and give you a sale
[1568.92s -> 1573.32s]  some customers may just be trying to sniff out a better price when they're really willing to
[1573.32s -> 1578.20s]  pay your initial price however whether or not you risk testing that possibility is up to you
[1578.20s -> 1583.72s]  how long can you well that depends on how long can you keep haggling depends
[1583.72s -> 1588.60s]  on how regular a customer the person in the question is as we're starting out you will not
[1588.60s -> 1593.08s]  be able to haggle for very long but after customers begin to trust us a little you
[1593.08s -> 1600.12s]  can haggle for a longer period of time well time to put the theory into practice um okay
[1602.12s -> 1609.66s]  why isn't why why aren't you the boss and you the fairy if i'm the manager i come in and
[1609.66s -> 1613.50s]  i switch them i say you put the wings on and you go stand behind that counter this is like
[1613.50s -> 1624.39s]  fucking stupid uh juno upset i'll just give 10 community subs thank you thanks with the 10
[1624.39s -> 1634.30s]  community subs much love to you uh could i get this please oh okay i pick a price right needs
[1634.30s -> 1647.98s]  to be higher than the base uh up button uh customer will likely buy immediately knife the
[1647.98s -> 1652.86s]  fine art of haggling theoretically what you wish to do is lower your price slowly but as
[1652.86s -> 1657.58s]  i mentioned there is a limit how long you can haggle the idea is to deduce a customer's
[1657.58s -> 1665.51s]  desired price and go from there you say deduce the desired price but how do i the large number
[1665.51s -> 1672.49s]  of stores sell at about 30 over base price 30 it is not a hard and fast rule but people
[1672.49s -> 1678.06s]  will usually accept that price level usually if you can manage to go over that you will make
[1678.06s -> 1683.59s]  a lot of money but you do not want to risk driving away a customer right then so as a
[1683.59s -> 1703.51s]  customer i am haggling could you make it a little bit cheaper okay oh shit you want it cheap by
[1703.51s -> 1710.71s]  one cent all right here we go if you can sell me an item you'll be ready for what lies ahead
[1710.71s -> 1716.31s]  this is the true mentor and student come here hey so what's what's what's uh what's that like
[1716.31s -> 1720.07s]  the famous one like sell me this he likes to sell me this uh sell me this pen right

[1786.68s -> 1792.90s]  to get these i had to go dungeon dumpster diving to find this all right all right you

[1810.10s -> 1816.41s]  sell me a product that is like what why do we have to do this did you do the shit when
[1816.41s -> 1821.85s]  you buy a car too how much is your car uh twenty thousand dollars no it isn't how much
[1821.85s -> 1828.25s]  is the car for real uh it's actually uh actually seventeen thousand dollars no it's not what's
[1828.25s -> 1832.25s]  the actual what do you what do you want from that car you know fifteen thousand is what
[1832.25s -> 1837.69s]  we want to sell this car for okay cool can i have the car for fifteen thousand
[1837.69s -> 1843.37s]  well i mean i mean well i don't think so you see because the car costs like nine
[1843.37s -> 1867.58s]  thousand dollars to make and why do we do this just sell it i lost why do we do this
[1867.58s -> 1881.70s]  to ourselves there's no reason to do this okay you know what i like you we're gonna start at 3800
[1886.46s -> 1893.61s]  so he's oh he's a ceasar communist no no i know i'm just saying i want to buy a product
[1893.61s -> 1897.61s]  if you want to sell me a product put a fucking price tag on it and sell it to me
[1898.41s -> 1902.25s]  why do we have to have like a like a three and a half hour long back and forth
[1902.25s -> 1907.37s]  where you tell me your life story so i pay more money for the car than it actually is
[1907.85s -> 1915.85s]  just put there's a price tag on the car there's a price tag on the car why not just have no price
[1915.85s -> 1928.55s]  tag and just say hey come on in and let's chat why is there a price on the car oh i did it
[1932.31s -> 1936.07s]  cut his mic no if a car is fifteen thousand dollars and you want to sell it for fifteen
[1936.07s -> 1939.75s]  thousand dollars and you have a price tag on the car for fifteen thousand dollars
[1940.63s -> 1946.17s]  that's what the car should be you shouldn't put a fake price tag on the car until the
[1946.17s -> 1950.17s]  customer comes in and says well that's fucked up i know i know i know it's wicked fucked up
[1951.03s -> 1962.60s]  it's actually 12 have a good day what oh we're gonna do it okay i would like this please all

[2000.70s -> 2003.82s]  and that is essentially how it goes you're quite good for someone who has
[2004.70s -> 2010.30s]  never done this before and has asked so many questions and was essentially just
[2010.30s -> 2018.60s]  parroting every sentence i said and not really learning anything we still have a
[2018.60s -> 2022.20s]  little bit of time left today so let us go ahead and open the store proper if anyone
[2022.20s -> 2028.07s]  comes in simply handle them in the same way that we just practice whoa are you sure it'll be okay
[2029.03s -> 2033.35s]  do not worry as the saying goes salesmanship is more of an art than it is a science
[2035.59s -> 2039.59s]  we're just fucking around all the time it's not about selling products it's just it's an
[2039.59s -> 2045.83s]  art now give me a paintbrush it looks like fucking make money now then i'll open us up

[2216.23s -> 2223.61s]  i'm not saying we gotta do this i'm just i'm just making statements it's been three months
[2223.61s -> 2243.83s]  since papa left i don't get why he suddenly said i'm gonna go be a hero and then took off
[2243.83s -> 2252.63s]  without saying when he'd be back i really hope he's okay i'm getting lonely what the
[2252.63s -> 2258.49s]  fuck is going on right now well i shouldn't worry too much about him the best thing about
[2258.49s -> 2272.23s]  him is how tough he is he'll be okay is it dad is that burp papa wouldn't knock who is that
[2274.36s -> 2288.73s]  who is it there's nobody there wait what's at my feet here good evening um you are mademoiselle
[2288.73s -> 2296.26s]  reset lemongrass uh miss fairy pardon me but i am the one asking the questions
[2297.22s -> 2305.62s]  again you are reseti lemongrass um yes i'm reset my name is tier i'm an agent of the
[2305.62s -> 2314.10s]  term finance company finance company i'm here to collect payment on the loan paid out to your
[2314.10s -> 2325.77s]  father here is the contract and my identification um loan repayment uh in plainter terms i'm here
[2325.77s -> 2331.29s]  to get our money back and another thing about loans let's talk about fucking loans and how
[2331.85s -> 2337.61s]  they if you are incapable of facilitating repayment this house will be seized as
[2337.61s -> 2351.21s]  collateral in order to pay the loan i tell you this this person doesn't even know anything
[2352.68s -> 2361.66s]  facilitating collateral huh seize what
[2370.49s -> 2381.77s]  papa is he's not here yes i see that now uh monsieur lemongrass disappeared following a
[2382.41s -> 2393.02s]  fracas atop the local volcano so we assumed he might have returned here even if he has not
[2393.02s -> 2400.36s]  however the contract covers this eventuality covers this quite as the some i'm not gonna
[2400.36s -> 2405.51s]  read her lines anymore quite as the sole remaining member of his household we shall
[2405.51s -> 2414.18s]  require that you pay his debts in his stead i barely have enough money to live by myself
[2414.18s -> 2418.82s]  naturally we're not demanding it all be repaid at once there's still a small amount of
[2418.82s -> 2426.04s]  time before any payment is due therefore am i gonna get sold off in parts to distant foreign
[2426.04s -> 2433.24s]  lands to repay papa's debts i wonder if i can survive with only two internal organs
[2436.54s -> 2439.18s]  maybe if i eat a lot of spinach that can replace my blood
[2446.30s -> 2454.66s]  all right i'm sorry guys but she's pretty dumb you know like we've seen a lot of
[2454.66s -> 2460.18s]  sentence repeating thinking if you eat spinach it's gonna replace blood like you i mean come on
[2466.62s -> 2470.70s]  ahem please listen to me for a moment i have no clue where you're getting these
[2470.70s -> 2475.34s]  ludicrous ideas from but i would never do such a thing quite the opposite in fact
[2475.34s -> 2479.26s]  i was sent here to ensure that you wouldn't have to resort to such well absurd methods
[2479.26s -> 2486.47s]  to pay us back instead let me give you a different solution work for us for the rest of
[2486.55s -> 2498.68s]  your life 10 to 12 hours a day paying slowly back until you're 80 i've been sent to support
[2498.68s -> 2507.93s]  you to the fullest of my ability so that you may repay the debt via labor wait what but i've
[2507.93s -> 2518.42s]  never worked a single day in my life experience is no bearing no no work experience all that
[2518.42s -> 2527.03s]  matters is whether or not you are willing to work uh that was not the kind of response
[2527.03s -> 2535.42s]  that i would have assumed would happen from that why would you just go oh if you do not wish
[2535.42s -> 2542.20s]  to work then that is that the house is mine and i will have to ask you to leave the premises
[2542.84s -> 2548.58s]  as the saying goes those who do not work do not eat so miss lemongrass which will it be
[2548.58s -> 2558.92s]  work or the house yes remember happy gilmore his grandfather built that fucking house with
[2558.92s -> 2567.75s]  his bare hands and then that dickhead comes along that golf pro trying to like buy it
[2568.31s -> 2584.90s]  spoilers by the way for happy gilmore what can i even do i already have an idea this is the
[2584.90s -> 2590.60s]  backstory the city is an adventuring hub in addition this house faces out onto one of the
[2590.60s -> 2596.44s]  main city lanes therefore i propose converting this house into a store i would be like take
[2596.44s -> 2605.18s]  the fucking house you like cold-hearted piece of shit so you already own the store it did
[2605.18s -> 2616.54s]  just take the house well we won't take your house we'll just turn it into our house but
[2616.54s -> 2633.22s]  you can still sleep here just just squish the fairy yeah dude like come on i can't turn the
[2633.22s -> 2640.54s]  webcam on but i kind of have to just listen to sasame street music for a second this is
[2640.54s -> 2672.87s]  important all right so yeah what what what's stopping you from going from doing something
[2672.87s -> 2677.51s]  like this you know she's saying all these things like oh yeah we're gonna like own your
[2677.51s -> 2685.53s]  house and oh yeah your father is a fucking adventurer just like yeah oh yeah go ahead
[2685.53s -> 2717.99s]  tell me follow us what got you she's not that small how do you know she'd survive
[2718.63s -> 2733.13s]  did i lose my why did i lose this i was only gone for a little while to do market research
[2738.58s -> 2748.68s]  where could she have gone i'm like sleeping under the covers like fucking sad all i did
[2748.68s -> 2752.36s]  was threaten to take away everything she ever knew and loved asking her to turn the house
[2752.36s -> 2758.98s]  into an item shop was foolish even if it was to repay the debt the poor girl must be terribly
[2758.98s -> 2766.46s]  confused and on top of that her father is probably uh oh wait what's going on why is
[2766.46s -> 2778.84s]  the house being filled with like yayness it's done hey tier look it's done what is that
[2779.48s -> 2786.12s]  oh it's our shop sign of course doesn't it look cool but but it's on the ground oh of
[2786.12s -> 2790.84s]  course it's on the ground isn't that interesting how it's on the ground what what would be under
[2790.84s -> 2807.34s]  the ground here what are you what are you doing oh you know it's your grave you can't be a shop
[2807.34s -> 2817.18s]  without one of these you know yes well it's quite made well made he he said oh by the way
[2817.18s -> 2823.35s]  before i started uh i need to make this really clear before the stream started i was in chat
[2823.35s -> 2827.99s]  we were just talking and like talking about stuff and having fun and chilling and stuff
[2827.99s -> 2836.09s]  i wrote ha ha ha and everybody mocked me for doing it and i realized that you i can no longer
[2836.09s -> 2844.84s]  write like he he or like ha ha in text anymore because it's seen as like weird ironic fake
[2845.48s -> 2857.85s]  like laughing i can't run you cannot write ha ha ha ever again you have to do an emote now
[2857.85s -> 2864.87s]  it's seen as like a kappa ha ha ha oh yeah funny right no no i actually thought that was
[2864.87s -> 2875.53s]  funny well do the right emote then be that as it may while the sign is nice i am is there a
[2875.53s -> 2884.26s]  problem well the name you're quite sure that you have thought that through well we're partners
[2884.26s -> 2897.19s]  right you said so so put reset and tear together and reset here isn't it neat well that is to
[2897.19s -> 2904.71s]  say the sentiment is commendable but it's the two of us opening the store so the name should
[2904.79s -> 2909.03s]  reflect that right you don't like it really it's not that but well
[2910.87s -> 2922.33s]  okay your risk of tear that's awful why would you put tear it you know there's no reason for
[2922.33s -> 2932.76s]  that mispronounced it even slightly and reket tear racket racketeer this job is going to be
[2932.76s -> 2941.85s]  even more absurdly difficult than i originally suspected i fear and so a fairy suddenly
[2941.85s -> 2959.05s]  entered my life one thing was for sure this sure wasn't going to be dull how is it possible
[2959.05s -> 2977.90s]  to sleep this much each day how tear let's do the very best we can reset wake up please
[2979.78s -> 2988.15s]  what who's on first that's a boomer joke that's a super boomer joke that's so boomer that's
[2988.15s -> 2994.98s]  such a boomer joke that shits in black and white that's how old that joke is i just think
[2994.98s -> 3001.05s]  it's funny the clock does not have a good morning hand wait didn't we already do this
[3002.17s -> 3007.54s]  you're the proprietor of an item shop you must learn to be responsible and not sleep the day
[3007.54s -> 3014.06s]  away right right right right okay well why in the name of heaven are you smiling so much the
[3014.06s -> 3018.94s]  smile you have while sleeping is just getting bigger no no reason i just think i saw something
[3018.94s -> 3024.46s]  nice in my dreams here let's give it our all well if you really are dedicated to making
[3024.46s -> 3032.89s]  this work wash yourself and meet me downstairs will do can i play can i fucking play
[3035.77s -> 3043.38s]  so i have an item shop and stuff and it's all cool and awesome so uh what do i do now
[3044.34s -> 3048.50s]  that's up to your judgment if you sit at the counter we can open immediately
[3048.50s -> 3051.94s]  or we can reorganize the shop or we could even go search for new stock
[3052.02s -> 3057.59s]  around town or elsewhere yikes that's a ton of options how do i choose
[3058.97s -> 3062.65s]  it is as i said earlier running a place like this is more of an art than it is something
[3062.65s -> 3066.97s]  you can simply follow a map through simply pick something we will deal with what comes
[3068.01s -> 3079.94s]  okay welcome to recetteer all right i have 130 bucks how long is the day day two
[3080.50s -> 3085.80s]  how much money do i have not enough i need to sell this thing i gotta sell the sword
[3087.38s -> 3102.09s]  let's do it open the store wait hold on town square pub chapel adventurers guild
[3104.28s -> 3114.65s]  i mean it's blinking this shit's blinking hey what's this place this is the adventurers
[3114.65s -> 3118.17s]  guild the guild manages expeditions to the various untamed wilderness areas there have
[3118.17s -> 3121.45s]  been ruins in the city the area is commonly referred to as dungeons without approval
[3121.45s -> 3125.05s]  adventurers cannot visit dungeons you have to get approved ah we can't just go into the
[3125.05s -> 3129.53s]  dungeon to pick up everything now why what the heck we could get a ton of profit and shit
[3129.53s -> 3132.49s]  it's still a very good idea great many people evade that you can go into the dungeon and
[3132.49s -> 3136.01s]  get stuff and collect it and sell it but you have to identify it we must first hire an
[3136.01s -> 3143.72s]  adventurer can i just pick anybody the truth of the matter is a bit more complicated even
[3143.72s -> 3147.88s]  if you pay them few adventures are willing to risk their lives simply for the benefit
[3147.88s -> 3152.52s]  of a complete stranger mostly they turn away people when they don't know but yes
[3153.82s -> 3157.02s]  get to know a few adventures and build up a certain level of trust with them
[3157.82s -> 3161.66s]  if all goes well they will give you a symbol of their guild membership this usually takes the
[3161.66s -> 3167.75s]  form of a card with that in hand we can bring an adventurer with us so it's like they're
[3167.75s -> 3175.00s]  inviting us to a dinner party no you're going into a dungeon where you might both die see
[3178.04s -> 3183.05s]  attempting to rip you limb for i said i said it first but the analogy does work somewhere
[3183.77s -> 3188.81s]  right so first i need to meet adventurer where do you meet adventurers at the bar
[3188.81s -> 3192.17s]  after all we run an item shop we should get a few coming in as clients on a fairly
[3192.17s -> 3198.73s]  regular basis all right we're gonna sell that sword to somebody let's go get a dinner invitation
[3198.73s -> 3206.98s]  indeed just be careful that reset is not on the menu huh is something wrong well that guy
[3206.98s -> 3216.92s]  over there listen to me if i can't work i can't get the money and if i can't get the money
[3216.92s -> 3220.84s]  i can't get the items and if i can't get the items apparently i can't work
[3223.08s -> 3226.60s]  heaven if i had a few things i could at least visit the hall of trials
[3229.66s -> 3234.76s]  oh i wonder what's going on he seems to be a rookie adventurer complaining about his inability
[3234.76s -> 3239.96s]  to complete the required guild test oh test it is guild test the guild hardly allows anyone
[3239.96s -> 3243.96s]  off the street you can only work officially with the guild after passing tears and items up
[3243.96s -> 3250.79s]  owners hardly the only every episode of every single one of these i've ever watched i have an
[3250.79s -> 3260.58s]  idea sorry i do believe we have found our first adventurer wait what do you mean by uh tier
[3260.58s -> 3270.63s]  weight oh son of a i burn what cash i had just getting to the city if i can't get into the
[3270.63s -> 3275.03s]  guild i don't know what i'll even do for dinner money now i'm hungry great
[3278.50s -> 3284.58s]  excuse me pardon me a moment are you there adventurer with the seedy look who you calling
[3284.58s -> 3293.85s]  seedy well you two would be uh we're a pair of merchants who happen to be passing
[3294.65s -> 3300.65s]  merchants oh you heard me talking sorry but i'm way too broke and seedy to buy anything
[3302.76s -> 3306.52s]  believe me i could tell about your seedy nature that you're attempting to sell you
[3306.52s -> 3312.86s]  anything would be a colossal waste of time now come on tier stop with the seedy already he
[3312.86s -> 3323.80s]  isn't a plant minus two by the way so are you two going to prune me or what here would
[3323.80s -> 3327.64s]  you like it if we came with you to the hall of trials if you require equipment or items
[3327.64s -> 3337.37s]  we can provide them i'd call you a pair of angels then but why business naturally we help you pass
[3337.37s -> 3343.62s]  the trial you provide us with your card oh i get it we help mr swordsman clear the dungeon
[3343.62s -> 3356.50s]  and then he gives us his card a sign of our eternal friendship very dumb uh eternal friendship
[3356.50s -> 3361.22s]  is rather irrelevant in this case but it does work out neatly for all of us what do you say
[3361.22s -> 3368.23s]  i see you guys are pretty new at all this too huh oh that was i i did that one pretty i
[3368.23s -> 3374.28s]  phoned that part that was a phoned in line i'll offer mr swordsman yes or no yes
[3377.85s -> 3384.78s]  that wasn't me i swear that was in the game all right then heck i got nothing to lose while
[3384.78s -> 3393.02s]  aside from my precious life anyway yayifications glad to meet you too uh i'm reset nice to meet
[3393.02s -> 3401.19s]  you what's your name um what's louis call me louis louis the swordsman good to meet you
[3402.44s -> 3405.64s]  yes yes now then we will begin all the preparations for a dungeon visit
[3406.36s -> 3410.20s]  is he gonna die including a visit to the central market to pick up food and other
[3410.20s -> 3417.69s]  restorative items we'll then return here for you when we are ready right i'll be waiting here
[3417.69s -> 3434.66s]  all right so now we have to go to the we have to go get food um the apple is a bit sour
[3434.66s -> 3443.19s]  so it's best used in jam or a pie um he's a too much money i can buy bread this town
[3443.19s -> 3449.14s]  staple snack walnuts soft dough and a bit of sugar make it perfect i guess i'm gonna buy
[3449.14s -> 3464.89s]  two breads one bread can i can i like chase down the lady i sold the bread to all right
[3464.89s -> 3475.86s]  will he live off of one bread he's got a worn sword leather armor wooden shield old muffler
[3475.86s -> 3487.69s]  why does he have a muffler on uses sore okay leave leave level one swordsman louis pick the
[3487.69s -> 3496.98s]  items you wish to bring with you and finish like the depart option you got one bread let's go the
[3496.98s -> 3507.58s]  hall of trials so this is the dungeon just so welcome to the jungle as they say and another
[3507.58s -> 3515.62s]  hour long tutorial on how to control in combat i'm not a monster slayer i'm scared the two of
[3515.62s -> 3519.62s]  us are perfectly safe there's a protective field around the two of us to the monsters
[3519.62s -> 3527.69s]  we may as well be invisible so why are you on screen you could have just not put them on screen
[3528.25s -> 3535.46s]  you could have just sent this guy down louis perfectly safe too then no no not quite actually
[3537.21s -> 3543.21s]  uh well louis is uh you know louis could see some problems in the next few minutes
[3543.85s -> 3546.42s]  we don't have to worry but this is accomplished by making us virtually
[3546.42s -> 3549.22s]  intangible to everything inside this place we can directly manipulate nothing
[3550.18s -> 3557.75s]  we can't collect things why are we in here that's why our adventurer remains outside the field
[3558.63s -> 3563.40s]  so this guy picks up stuff should i venture be injured we can place him in the field
[3564.28s -> 3569.16s]  and retreat since we must carry him back however we can take very little else with us
[3569.16s -> 3574.65s]  one item at most so even if we run into trouble we don't lose everything but wait
[3574.65s -> 3578.65s]  i thought you said we can't yes i will elaborate further if need be later i'm not
[3578.65s -> 3585.11s]  going to press that button we can bring as much as our bags will allow us to carry if we get out
[3585.11s -> 3594.18s]  safely cool wait as much as our bags will allow well you have bags too yep yep the adventurers
[3594.18s -> 3600.34s]  focus on adventuring while we keep track of what to loot you got it cool k o day let's get
[3600.42s -> 3604.26s]  karate equip items in bag
[3611.83s -> 3618.76s]  all right i just used sp slime
[3624.68s -> 3634.87s]  is this money where are these items this would be more tolerable if you muted
[3634.87s -> 3648.60s]  why would i mute this something in here oh crafter's knife that'll beat me a pretty penny i think
[3652.46s -> 3660.55s]  is it goo what is it can i pick it up slime fluid missed i got it i got it
[3664.92s -> 3673.24s]  oh he's dead is there a dodge roll if there's a dodge roll that's gonna be

[3710.17s -> 3721.69s]  term of the crits yes oh sure i don't know if i want to stand on this
[3722.58s -> 3726.74s]  not yet is there a run or a sprint or a dash

[4074.30s -> 4077.82s]  i might have to make the game full screen though because it's really kind of chugged down

[4506.17s -> 4514.15s]  a door you do have to restart okay that's good to know so if you find a door always use it
[4514.15s -> 4521.13s]  returning home takes time furthermore leaving ends the current contract with our companion
[4521.13s -> 4526.58s]  and we would have to rehire him or choose a new one if there is something specific in a
[4526.58s -> 4532.04s]  dungeon that you desire you can simply ignore the doors and press onward so it is stardew

[5140.07s -> 5147.86s]  bread probably not a good idea but we got slime we got bread here we go open it up
[5150.70s -> 5158.30s]  i have now a candy store oh slime fluid plus three oh i'll take this
[5161.58s -> 5168.90s]  write that i'd call that a fair deal thank you somebody buy the chocolate it's expensive
[5170.41s -> 5181.32s]  oh this will do souvenir charm can you sell it for just a little less all right there
[5181.32s -> 5188.76s]  i'm old and i think that 399 is the same thing as 400 because i've been conditioned to think that
[5188.76s -> 5195.24s]  for some reason 99 of some sense means it's way less thank you have a good day
[5204.30s -> 5209.98s]  oh it's me again you know how much for this piece of clothing it's a little too expensive
[5209.98s -> 5223.74s]  for me 99 cents that's a fair deal for me thank you oh it's me again i don't you have such
[5223.74s -> 5241.32s]  good prices at your store how much is this bread oh it's 99 cents i'll take it looking for
[5241.32s -> 5252.14s]  something i want this oh right i should have done 199 i was scamming myself uh well
[5252.78s -> 5270.47s]  well young lady that'll be um well could you make it a little cheaper this is getting dumb
[5275.03s -> 5279.43s]  that's getting like trouble because i was like selling like something too expensive to like
[5279.43s -> 5296.78s]  child wait she wasn't buying like a knife right what was she buying was that a plant
[5298.18s -> 5305.98s]  bread bread okay i know she wasn't buying like a sword or anything well then you seem to
[5305.98s -> 5309.10s]  have developed a basic understanding of how to sell things to people and not drive them
[5309.10s -> 5314.46s]  to burn the shop in anger yepperoni yepperoni
[5320.52s -> 5326.89s]  why does it what i feel like my mother just texted me back yes being a truly great store
[5326.89s -> 5330.25s]  owner involves more than selling things however there are there are times when people will want
[5330.25s -> 5337.30s]  to sell items to you really i suspect we'll begin to get such offers very soon
[5338.55s -> 5342.63s]  but i already buy stuff from the guild and the market so why should i worry about buying
[5342.79s -> 5347.43s]  stuff from the customers there's one major difference between a guild or a market purchase
[5347.43s -> 5353.99s]  and a purchase from an individual individuals do not have set prices in other words you can
[5353.99s -> 5361.72s]  scam them as you do while you're selling haggled down oh so i can get stuff really cheap but
[5361.72s -> 5366.60s]  that seems like it'd be pretty hard fundamentally buying and selling are not that different
[5366.60s -> 5370.84s]  the customer shows you an item they wish to sell and then you set a price and perhaps
[5370.84s -> 5377.98s]  negotiate obviously you wish to pay less than the base price of the item okay so buy
[5377.98s -> 5384.97s]  high and sell low that sounds like what i do on markets all the time just so that is the very
[5384.97s -> 5390.01s]  core of a successful business now then shall we practice the fundamental procedure is the same
[5390.01s -> 5401.00s]  as when selling okay welcome to recetteer uh would you buy this from me hmm let me
[5401.00s -> 5415.16s]  need to name a price 1096 at this level there will not be much profit when we resell
[5415.96s -> 5424.78s]  go somewhat lower really all right this this is like a knockoff at this point eight percent of
[5424.78s -> 5433.00s]  base price 826 excellent this is a good price level now then let us practice haggling over
[5433.00s -> 5437.46s]  the price it's the same now that you have offered a price you believe to be fair adjust
[5437.46s -> 5442.30s]  your offer until you agree to sell to you could you offer me a little more i think it's
[5442.30s -> 5451.88s]  worth a lot 50 and 70 percent of the base is a good target you will gain an item to sell without
[5451.88s -> 5466.71s]  giving up too much money let's go welcome uh what would you be willing to pay for this
[5467.99s -> 5487.38s]  i forgot everything you told me pay twice 150 thank you welcome two thousand dollars for a
[5487.38s -> 5496.31s]  baked yam uh bring that down 900 you're really easy to buy from i could say whatever i want
[5497.03s -> 5505.70s]  you just removed 65 percent of all value all right do i have what what items do i have
[5506.90s -> 5510.02s]  the apple on there i want this to be a food based restaurant all right and then
[5510.02s -> 5532.60s]  back scratch is going to go up here right here get rid of that get this other bullshit over
[5532.60s -> 5547.75s]  here all right let's do it again one two three open the store welcome can i help you with
[5547.75s -> 5560.30s]  anything i remember you this is a present from mommy it's a present you know it's a present for

[5668.41s -> 5672.81s]  see don't think didn't think i'd get that good price

[5725.82s -> 5731.02s]  shit i knew what you were doing and you know that i respect you for that i respect you for
[5731.02s -> 5740.84s]  doing that to me can i help you any chance i could get you to buy this little lady
[5741.80s -> 5759.22s]  oh it's a yam it's a really expensive yam oh you're old hold on give me one second let me pick this
[5759.22s -> 5765.70s]  up uh this is a rock it's a rock yes it's a rock this is only this is worth nothing oh sorry
[5766.58s -> 5788.71s]  thank you bye you can have it i'd like this 100 120 that seems fair holy cow it's late
[5788.71s -> 5793.35s]  times seem to fly by today speaking of time i plan on doing some mild schedule management
[5793.35s -> 5797.59s]  for you from now on to ensure you're working in an effective manner to pay back the debt
[5798.47s -> 5807.38s]  what are you talking about i've broken up the day into four time periods morning afternoon
[5807.38s -> 5814.12s]  evening and night what you can do and how much you can do depends on the time of day
[5814.92s -> 5821.70s]  hey yeah the clock's been broken up into four areas think of each part as a slice of time
[5822.87s -> 5829.51s]  a slice like pie yeah okay i thought i would be able to keep your attention if i made it
[5829.51s -> 5834.39s]  rather similar to some sort of sweet food so this is the morning slice the afternoon i'm
[5834.39s -> 5847.59s]  getting hungry so this four sections of the day you can only act between morning and night
[5847.59s -> 5851.83s]  yes when night ends you need to go to bed trying to run a shop while sleep deprived is
[5851.83s -> 5858.39s]  unpleasant so i'll close up when it gets late so you essentially have two options for each slice
[5858.39s -> 5864.15s]  you can open the store for a time or go about town on business you can't do both at once so
[5864.15s -> 5870.55s]  decide in advance what you need to do to be clear opening the shop will consume a slice
[5870.55s -> 5874.95s]  and returning to the store after going out regardless of what you actually did
[5874.95s -> 5880.52s]  will also consume a slice but what if i go to like the plaza and then the chapel
[5881.78s -> 5888.34s]  slice slice you can get around town easily enough to avoid consuming a slice with each move
[5888.34s -> 5892.98s]  only when you return to the store will the clock advance a slice so in that case i should do a
[5892.98s -> 5900.50s]  lot when i leave the shop yes that's a good attitude to take now there's another vital element
[5900.50s -> 5908.50s]  leaving town all together visiting a dungeon will consume two slices no matter what that takes
[5908.50s -> 5915.54s]  that long so if i go in the morning and i'll get back in the evening that's precisely how it works
[5915.54s -> 5920.66s]  thus you can only leave for a dungeon at an early point in the day if it is night or you
[5920.66s -> 5926.02s]  have done something else that evening you cannot go because if i did go i'd get back
[5926.02s -> 5931.78s]  real late right exactly not only would you annoy your adventurer companions with staying
[5931.78s -> 5935.78s]  out so late you would also be dead on your feet the next day after returning
[5936.74s -> 5944.47s]  man this is a lot to wrap my head around you guys ever watch uh training videos company training
[5944.47s -> 5952.82s]  videos i'm getting that vibe right now this is go watch go watch the pizza hut training video
[5952.82s -> 5958.34s]  i watch it all the time we're making it great i'm not kidding i like lie in bed and watch
[5958.34s -> 5973.21s]  training videos i don't know they're like soothing to me i don't know why that's sad
[5973.21s -> 5979.24s]  what do you mean that's sad i'll have my ipad and like kim will be next to me and will it be
[5979.24s -> 5984.20s]  like okay good but good night go to i'm going to bed we'll be like on our devices and i'll
[5984.20s -> 5998.41s]  load up the wendy's training video it's like 45 minutes long and i just watch it it's it's
[5998.41s -> 6008.06s]  like an infomercial before you know it you will be thinking about it naturally you guys yeah
[6008.06s -> 6011.74s]  don't you don't you put the sauce in the middle and you go out you leave about a half
[6011.74s -> 6014.30s]  an inch on the edge you don't put the sauce all the way to the edge of the pizza
[6015.26s -> 6019.82s]  and you want to line the toppings up with the sauce never to go over that edge of the pizza
[6019.82s -> 6030.94s]  especially when making a pan pizza well it helps that you will always be able to see how much
[6030.94s -> 6034.94s]  time a particular action will consume simply pay attention to the clock i want to make sure
[6034.94s -> 6040.60s]  weigh out all your cheese and stuff and you do a top cheese as well the dough master in
[6040.60s -> 6043.80s]  the morning will give you uh and if there's any bubbles or it doesn't look very good
[6043.80s -> 6054.54s]  report it to the dough master and use another one i will be glad to go over it as often as
[6054.54s -> 6066.66s]  you need i don't think i need to go over i'm actually a dough master so you know what i'm
[6066.66s -> 6075.40s]  talking about all right so i got like i can open the store one more time look at this shit baked
[6075.40s -> 6081.88s]  yam let's get the let's get our food here beef bowl uh let's put nothing here i'm gonna
[6081.88s -> 6084.92s]  back scratcher should go over this way put the sandals
[6084.92s -> 6088.60s]  is
[6092.01s -> 6093.74s]  and i want the fish up there too
[6098.98s -> 6103.08s]  back scratcher goes down here these are gonna sell for thousands of dollars
[6106.46s -> 6111.58s]  he's like old guy's gonna come in the store and buy the yam for three times as much as he

[6159.74s -> 6163.26s]  hmm
[6164.78s -> 6188.04s]  oh really thanks it's you again this is a present for daddy as long as i can get a little bit of
[6188.04s -> 6194.70s]  money come up with the yam old man looking for something special oh i've been thinking
[6194.70s -> 6201.96s]  about getting one of these for a while now one goldfish graham cracker now these are
[6201.96s -> 6216.04s]  expensive 1500 customer service seems to be a lost art these days that's fine thank you
[6216.60s -> 6226.09s]  now thank you anybody else you have one of these it's a lucky day for both of us didn't
[6226.09s -> 6243.16s]  you just sell this to me all right so you lost a hundred bucks you lost well you lost a full
[6243.16s -> 6261.61s]  dollar oh yeah excuse me miss i would like to ask you if i could buy this please sir would do
[6262.49s -> 6268.31s]  weren't you in here yesterday yesterday i don't know what you're talking about i don't i haven't
[6268.31s -> 6286.49s]  been here oh that'll do thank you what a scam all right i can't help but notice what you just
[6286.49s -> 6294.47s]  did to that old man i'm reporting you i'm reporting you to osha hey could i purchase
[6294.47s -> 6312.26s]  this yeah you sure can 350 gee i sold an apple so this do you think i could turn it into a bit
[6312.26s -> 6330.78s]  of coin so you're selling me this candy okay i mean like maybe got it i almost have ten thousand
[6330.78s -> 6338.65s]  dollars you seem more or less used to the basics of running a shop there's one of the
[6338.65s -> 6342.33s]  matter however you cannot always be certain that a customer will know what they want when
[6342.57s -> 6347.88s]  come in what are you talking about they may come in thinking oh what should i make for dinner
[6348.52s -> 6351.96s]  what would be a good weapon and so forth they will not be quite sure exactly what they wish
[6351.96s -> 6356.20s]  to purchase when they come through our door in such a case we must provide them with advice
[6356.20s -> 6363.21s]  to help them decide wait wait how could i do that many customers will simply give up if they
[6363.21s -> 6368.41s]  do not find something suitable for their needs on our counters others whoever will realize
[6368.41s -> 6372.41s]  that we may have reserved stock and we would require as to whether or not we have something
[6372.41s -> 6377.00s]  they seek that's when you may suggest an item you think they would like
[6383.29s -> 6388.20s]  okay you'll impress them if you know what they want and you'll cause them to return
[6389.16s -> 6402.82s]  no pressure then okay let's practice kk welcome i would like a sword please so anything is okay
[6402.82s -> 6407.70s]  as long as it's a sword ultimately you must pick something the person would like by the
[6407.70s -> 6412.26s]  way if i may give you a little advice if you sell weapons and armor to your adventurer friends
[6412.26s -> 6418.44s]  they will equip the items you sell them meaning of course that if you sell items to them then
[6418.44s -> 6424.17s]  we do not need to lend them any items at the start of a dungeon and we'll be able to bring
[6424.17s -> 6430.74s]  back more items for our own use even if an adventurer must retreat while in a dungeon
[6430.74s -> 6436.55s]  the equipment is not lost since it's in their possession so we're just going to
[6436.55s -> 6442.70s]  scam all the whole way we're doing like meta scamming so we want to sell to our
[6442.70s -> 6448.55s]  adventurer friends even if you must undersell it to them well we don't have to do that don't worry
[6449.54s -> 6452.90s]  accessories work the same way so think carefully about who you sell what to
[6453.46s -> 6459.37s]  and what effect it may have on their performance so that guy came in and he bought
[6459.37s -> 6465.05s]  the armband so if i get any cool armor or weapons only sell it to the adventurers
[6469.62s -> 6473.14s]  you can see what that person currently has and see if it's better than that's cool
[6474.76s -> 6481.38s]  all right let's go i'd like a sword please i got one for you here it's a steel sword yes excellent

[6668.55s -> 6675.40s]  yeah that guy doesn't know how to negotiate i don't some people don't like negotiating
[6675.40s -> 6680.47s]  i'm not i don't really like it some people you know if somebody says oh that's uh
[6681.35s -> 6687.24s]  but here's the problem with negotiating you this is why like that this world is so fucking
[6687.32s -> 6693.88s]  dumb okay you can't like go into a macy's and negotiate the price of a pair of pants
[6694.92s -> 6699.00s]  you can't walk up to the fucking counter at macy's with like a fair pair of fucking jeans
[6700.54s -> 6705.46s]  uh this this says 80 i want to pay 60 uh sir what the fuck are you talking about
[6706.84s -> 6711.78s]  security we have like a fucking weirdo at the front desk but you can do that with
[6711.78s -> 6721.51s]  other forms of property why you can negotiate some places but other places you
[6721.51s -> 6725.35s]  you'll get like arrested if you try to tell them you're gonna pay 50 dollars for the 80 dollar
[6725.35s -> 6741.11s]  jeans you can do that with a house but not a pair of sandals that's what i'm saying
[6744.50s -> 6749.86s]  negotiation is such a strange thing i can't like negotiate with the guy at the bar how
[6749.86s -> 6758.98s]  much the drink is all right i want to go buy some stuff i have a lot of money yeah that's
[6758.98s -> 6765.94s]  a 750 for the bud light uh i mean what you meant to say was five dollars uh can we get
[6765.94s -> 6769.78s]  this fucking guy out of here and then you like cut to you getting like thrown out onto
[6769.78s -> 6788.06s]  the street all right let's go to the market hmm tree seed necklace cloth cape wait hold on

[6874.12s -> 6881.26s]  you're employed by them right what's it like no that's not quite accurate i was contracted to
[6881.26s -> 6887.96s]  term me through another organization thus i'm not really an employee per se so you just
[6887.96s -> 6893.72s]  contracted i'm surprised you seem so it's not that surprising almost all fairies in human
[6893.72s -> 6899.88s]  society belong to a fairy specific contract agency there are of course a few free agent
[6899.88s -> 6909.35s]  fairies out there as well and so that's how it works oh yeah it's like a baseball team
[6909.35s -> 6913.03s]  yes i have to tell the truth it can be difficult for fairies to find employment in human
[6913.03s -> 6920.89s]  society so the agencies were founded an age ago in order to help facilitate fairy livelihoods
[6920.89s -> 6929.22s]  that's amazing quite we just had that conversation in the church what was the
[6929.22s -> 6936.46s]  point of doing that in the church all right what town square i love being able to relax

[8269.46s -> 8273.38s]  drink had a strong wooden smell and it was not dissimilar to attempting to drink a tree
[8273.38s -> 8286.46s]  that's not true okay that doesn't sound yummy at all to be honest the popularity
[8286.46s -> 8290.62s]  of the substance baffles me it always sells well so stalking it is always a good way to make some

[9301.83s -> 9305.91s]  would you mind selling me this weird fucked up item that i could just put on a shelf
[9306.79s -> 9327.16s]  in a bathroom somewhere thank you hey i'm back again i'm thinking about getting a shield too
[9327.80s -> 9332.82s]  i'm thinking of throwing the spear out the window you know the one i just bought from you
[9333.38s -> 9338.82s]  and then going down my elevator and running out the front door and blocking it with the
[9338.82s -> 9344.62s]  shield i mean i i've lived like 600 stories after i think it's possible and i'm gonna make
[9344.62s -> 9351.48s]  a youtube video on it and do a slow motion that sounds like a really cool video idea
[9352.90s -> 9371.66s]  now that's too expected oh that's fine this is a present from mommy this girl is hard to
[9371.66s -> 9382.78s]  sell to let's just go with like let's go with like 103 i'm seeing pretty good on money
[9387.18s -> 9391.58s]  i don't know i can do the one more run on the store here furball
[9393.67s -> 9403.29s]  um kind of running out items i have so many capes i'm never selling those capes i'm gonna hold
[9403.29s -> 9421.11s]  those capes to zero what the garbage wait hold on how are we doing like politically here
[9421.67s -> 9435.14s]  all right keep that there let's get the capes look okay here's here's the thing
[9436.10s -> 9445.05s]  you want to know my strategy right now here's the strategy there's only capes in the store so
[9446.23s -> 9464.82s]  you have to buy one if that's the only thing right i was walking by and i noticed
[9464.82s -> 9476.47s]  you had the wife asked me to get some food perfect bread seems about right
[9477.75s -> 9486.76s]  any capes um you don't have some food do you you need more food
[9488.73s -> 9496.54s]  uh did you eat it before you left oh i screwed it up again oh boy
[9498.20s -> 9502.76s]  i was supposed to bring that food back to the wife and i ate it before i left the store
[9503.80s -> 9521.66s]  i wouldn't have any food all right time to pay the debt i have enough
[9530.30s -> 9533.42s]  should i just like tie the capes together and sell it as a parachute
[9534.92s -> 9538.68s]  i mean look if you want to be a good entrepreneur and a good business man
[9538.68s -> 9546.22s]  business woman you you adapt those are all two thousand dollars each no capes are boring but
[9546.22s -> 9551.50s]  if you tie them together and you make a giant parachute for 10 grand all of a sudden it's
[9551.50s -> 9558.76s]  really interesting uh incidentally you are aware that today is the first day of collections
[9560.46s -> 9568.31s]  hey what as in pay up or we take your house let's see i have a calendar that i can check

[9597.19s -> 9607.27s]  scaling upwards interest rate what the fuck is up with that all right we got capes here
[9607.27s -> 9619.90s]  here got it i heard and there was potentially parachutes here is that possible to see them
[9622.81s -> 9629.86s]  thank you see my twin brother came in there told me that there were parachutes available

[9856.12s -> 9867.35s]  i hear me out on this guys she i sold she i i bought it for a one thousand five one
[9867.35s -> 9893.29s]  that take profits when you can i don't know what your goal here was okay
[9893.29s -> 9896.62s]  okay six hundred sounds good
[9899.62s -> 9907.06s]  thousand dollars in profit just have to sell to the old man you gotta sell to the old man that
[9907.06s -> 9916.63s]  has like 10 kilos of gold in his house he just takes a razor and just shaves the top every
[9916.63s -> 9931.78s]  day and buys it every once all right i think it's time for bed it's a plus four slime
[9931.78s -> 9943.32s]  i'm out of inventory so all we got is you know hold on let's go get a drink
[9945.48s -> 9950.60s]  what is it why are adventurers in the pub so often do they all like alcohol that much
[9951.32s -> 9956.20s]  well adventurers certainly do enjoy their liquid pleasure but a pub like this also handles
[9956.20s -> 9962.55s]  quests for adventures really many of the people here are looking for work isn't that kind of
[9962.55s -> 9967.19s]  stuff handled by the adventurers guild the guild does also handle some quests but remember you can
[9967.19s -> 9972.79s]  only hire a guild adventurer officially if you possess the guild card of that person assuming
[9972.79s -> 9977.74s]  they have one at all therefore places like this tend to offer a different kind of quest
[9977.74s -> 9983.26s]  more daily run-of-the-mill business if you will clients do not pay as much as guild
[9983.26s -> 9989.02s]  sponsored ones but this sort of place is also far friendlier to rookies however if the
[9989.02s -> 9994.06s]  request is too simple or moronic it is likely that no one will even attempt to do it
[9995.74s -> 9999.02s]  look the requests are posted up there on the wall let us have a look shall we
[10000.30s -> 10005.26s]  let's see please find my lost kitty can i hire someone to stand in a ticket line for me
[10005.26s -> 10011.90s]  please kill 10 crows around the garbage dump green item offered can one of you hot studs
[10013.77s -> 10019.13s]  wow there's quite a variety well it's true that they are often used as glorified handymen
[10019.21s -> 10023.94s]  in a way this sort of thing is a sign of how much adventurers have blended into daily city
[10023.94s -> 10031.58s]  life in this city that's true hey actually we should do this quest i mean i'd love to help
[10031.58s -> 10038.01s]  someone find their kitty uh no i'm afraid we cannot well anyone can post a request only those
[10038.01s -> 10043.85s]  registered with the adventurers guild can legally take on such requests so i'm afraid
[10043.85s -> 10049.66s]  we cannot do anything listed here that's a bummer so why do we keep coming here why not
[10049.66s -> 10056.04s]  even like old enough to go in here how do we keep getting in the front door
[10062.62s -> 10069.90s]  i heard the door open who is it oh it's two children two children well whatever i'm just
[10069.90s -> 10081.16s]  gonna go back to cleaning my glass save i'll save oh ten thousand dollars in profit

[10153.08s -> 10157.56s]  to show that little shrew and this whole city what a truly elegant shop is like

[10167.70s -> 10174.73s]  parents silence you insolent fairy it'll be mine eventually that's practically the same thing

[11320.74s -> 11328.65s]  i really don't want to sell this but i don't want to buy this oh we both can agree on that
[11329.21s -> 11344.57s]  oh that's pretty good deal 50 off the necklace
[11349.24s -> 11353.72s]  it's a bit expensive yeah you're right 125 1250
[11353.72s -> 11357.30s]  week
[11360.38s -> 11360.94s]  everybody else
[11363.59s -> 11387.96s]  cherries 1200 just a little bit less 1179 what am i saying chewy minus 60 it's all right i but
[11387.96s -> 11402.49s]  i have that i spent like 16 or 17 thousand dollars news the price of candy has increased
[11403.13s -> 11412.73s]  the price of candy do i have candy oh that was a news flash important events are reported for
[11412.73s -> 11425.26s]  everyone in the city it's the twix brothers their stunt was a success all right uh that one
[11425.26s -> 11430.04s]  was a sudden jump in candy prices you're buying or selling candy pay close attention
[11433.19s -> 11437.75s]  sudden scarcity has driven the price of candy up in general that means that prices will
[11437.75s -> 11444.92s]  roughly double because like all the twix guys did the stunt yeah and the guy with the magic
[11444.92s -> 11461.32s]  wand i'm telling you he deleted all their capes finally my friend candy that sell for 300 may
[11461.32s -> 11470.81s]  now sell for 600 i'll buy all the candy in the city and keep it for myself maybe i'll share
[11470.81s -> 11476.57s]  or sell a little but it is candy ahem no prices will stabilize after some time
[11477.83s -> 11483.64s]  nobody can say for how long for once however you have hit upon a good point while it can be hard
[11483.64s -> 11488.44s]  to predict price fluctuations if you keep a fairly wide variety of stock handy it's possible
[11488.44s -> 11494.26s]  to take advantage of a situation like this and make money you can also try to take the
[11494.26s -> 11499.06s]  advantage of the situation after news comes in of course but it's harder to really make
[11499.06s -> 11506.42s]  a profit that way it's complicated i'm hungry it's really not that hard of a concept to
[11506.42s -> 11518.10s]  understand ah the news again watch carefully this information could be vital louis the swordsman
[11518.66s -> 11534.52s]  bounced check at local cafe now on the lamb louis doesn't have any money that's vital news
[11542.42s -> 11545.38s]  imagine if you turned on the news and they just talked about how
[11546.26s -> 11554.39s]  some random person couldn't pay for something i'll tell you though if that's your news
[11556.01s -> 11567.88s]  things are probably going pretty well wherever you are free louis oh wait wait wait come here

[15493.18s -> 15496.94s]  have officially received your payment for this week let us continue to work hard next week
[15499.19s -> 15512.12s]  i did it all right 50 grand 60 grand probably maybe 70 grand total all right gonna work hard
[15512.12s -> 15523.72s]  today too capitalism ho what's that girl doing outside the shop she's out just kind
[15523.80s -> 15536.23s]  of staring into the shop and she has a tattoo on her head okay does she want to come inside maybe
[15536.23s -> 15548.54s]  or are windows that gripping well smile receipt come on smile look friendly i just imagine a
[15548.54s -> 15556.47s]  forced teeth smile okay what should i do here call police please tell me you have not reached
[15556.47s -> 15562.28s]  the point where your face is frozen in a vapid smile for all eternity there's a girl
[15562.92s -> 15570.62s]  curious about the inside and she's looking scanning the items yeah we got a neighborhood
[15570.62s -> 15578.84s]  watch down here i'll just come and arrest you the shop so i try to give her my best come in
[15578.84s -> 15601.80s]  and buy lots of stuff smile she's not there anymore citizens of rest so i am terrifying you
[15601.80s -> 15611.06s]  say really terrifying is that smile you think yeah you're a terror can we just stop staring
[15611.14s -> 15630.42s]  at each other what did i do wrong now given how well you're doing i think it's time i
[15630.42s -> 15638.09s]  explained how to take an order in advance customers have simply put purchasing items
[15638.09s -> 15641.61s]  from us immediately with an advanced order however a customer will let us know what they
[15641.61s -> 15650.28s]  want and return in a set number of days to pick up the items obviously not every customer
[15650.28s -> 15653.40s]  will want to do this but if a customer tells you that they want something in so many days
[15654.20s -> 15668.39s]  it's an advanced order okay so i have to make sure i have it here it's pre-orders if they
[15668.39s -> 15671.99s]  simply wanted the items now they would purchase the items now the date is based on what is
[15671.99s -> 15677.43s]  convenient for the customer not you so if they want an item and say three days you must give
[15677.43s -> 15683.83s]  it to them then and remember we must be open to actually sell an item to someone so make
[15683.83s -> 15693.06s]  sure the store is open that day or we cannot fill the order okay it's too complex no i get
[15693.06s -> 15697.30s]  i understand this works people use advanced orders to purchase multiple items at once
[15697.30s -> 15704.63s]  it is an excellent chance to sell many items in one go try to fill as many as you can see
[15705.27s -> 15723.11s]  she said it was complicated i said it was fun all right let's go let's get rid of this actually
[15723.11s -> 15728.95s]  no i'm gonna hold on to the food there's gonna be a food surge i just know it somebody will
[15728.95s -> 15745.88s]  buy this fucking dumb necklace eventually get it in the window so how much am i how much do i owe
[15746.81s -> 15749.85s]  80 000 next week i knew it was gonna be hovering around there somewhere
[15749.85s -> 15761.94s]  there's a lot that is a lot okay i'm gonna i think i'm gonna go adventure
[15765.72s -> 15785.53s]  i think it's time to go down steel sword anything else i can take here
[15787.54s -> 15790.90s]  uh i could take some just the bread just in case you need i need to eat it
[15797.02s -> 15808.26s]  that's good so now we're gonna go to floor 11 to 15 so what's other equip items yes
[15808.26s -> 15813.62s]  so i'm looking for the
[15814.74s -> 15821.96s]  play-doh snake things i need like five of those play-doh green play-doh snake thingies
[15836.26s -> 15844.73s]  what what all right i just noticed somebody linked the total and immediately a bunch of
[15844.73s -> 15851.13s]  manipulators just did i didn't even do anything see that manipulation in real time that's market
[15851.13s -> 15874.39s]  manipulation you motherfuckers can go into jail for that this game is pretty fun i like this game
[15885.24s -> 15901.56s]  do i get to have anybody else besides louis tell me if i miss any items no go back around
[15901.56s -> 15905.34s]  this way
[15907.50s -> 15911.10s]  i mean i guess you know i i could just go down as fast as i possibly can
[15912.54s -> 15915.34s]  to try boots leather boots
[15921.03s -> 15924.39s]  don't be so stupid here
[15930.95s -> 15932.15s]  okay i thought that was an npc
[15942.33s -> 15950.06s]  oops can i block is there a way to hold the shield up i guess not
[15958.71s -> 15966.94s]  you have to parry well that would be shocking oh you auto block from the front okay that's
[15966.94s -> 15970.62s]  good enough
[15979.26s -> 15980.38s]  stupid rocks
[15985.82s -> 15998.71s]  uh kind of an odd random encounter yeah that was that actually you're right that was a sharp
[15998.71s -> 16006.52s]  nato all right don't get sloppy here because i don't have a way to heal i have to level up
[16006.52s -> 16016.70s]  the heal or eat the bread and i brought one bread all right i'm gonna have to eat it
[16023.45s -> 16025.61s]  no i i think i could probably level up before that
[16032.44s -> 16041.75s]  more bread really no play-doh snake things
[16041.75s -> 16045.11s]  uh

[16067.86s -> 16080.65s]  fish wheel it's not fish wheel what is everything that i i get hit by or die to have to be a
[16080.65s -> 16089.99s]  wheel

[21902.38s -> 21905.77s]  too
[21911.00s -> 21929.78s]  slime livers right the liver only drops from the boss slime really seems kind of odd
[21935.94s -> 21944.02s]  mushroom just take it he literally explained this i mean if but if you think that i was
[21944.02s -> 21952.89s]  paying attention to 40 even if the dialogue on the screen i really just wasn't and i i'm
[21952.89s -> 21960.18s]  assuming the majority of everybody here can say the same cursor on the screen i don't where
[21960.82s -> 21977.11s]  where there's no cursor on the screen why it's not not it's not good to lie
[21983.37s -> 21992.34s]  where's my fucking mouse it's under the desk that was what fell down earlier i got it i got
[21996.41s -> 22009.53s]  i saw it just cover it with your own mouse that's you know that's a 500 iq play
[22016.14s -> 22016.62s]  get them all
[22023.82s -> 22029.74s]  bugs damn it they usually drop the um thing i'm looking for
[22031.26s -> 22034.65s]  now nobody wants a common wooden shield nobody wants that
[22037.13s -> 22042.49s]  yeah 16
[22049.27s -> 22050.15s]  those sell for a lot
[22059.30s -> 22066.01s]  so is it it's a percentage chance to just drop from the slime boss so i need to just
[22066.01s -> 22075.21s]  do the slime boss over and over again is this monster hunter
[22081.26s -> 22089.82s]  oh that's a nice helmet warrior's helmet

[22104.23s -> 22116.60s]  you'll see it i'm kind of addicted to this game it's such a simple concept but it's it's
[22116.60s -> 22117.40s]  fun
[22122.38s -> 22125.66s]  nice to get all the bugs yes all right i need one more of these
[22128.76s -> 22131.80s]  one more of those things and i can cry i confuse the uh
[22133.56s -> 22144.66s]  try moonlighter it's similar i gotta go to a surprise party you gotta stream it again
[22144.66s -> 22153.78s]  after tomorrow we'll see if i'm still addicted and i'm still having fun i don't know we'll
[22153.78s -> 22160.49s]  just do it again moonlighter is kind of bad says lucretius look what do you it's bad
[22161.29s -> 22176.14s]  oh did you just start fighting it's a good game what's wrong with it
[22177.90s -> 22186.95s]  this is the only thing we play now special inkwell i'm getting some treasures here
[22187.43s -> 22194.86s]  but that's just like your opinion man well it's not my opinion i haven't played it
[22195.90s -> 22199.18s]  it could be great could be bad could be awful could be fun i don't know
[22202.94s -> 22207.26s]  forget about the mushrooms although i don't know dude i might need them
[22207.26s -> 22210.06s]  eventually or something up to make a fusion i don't know
[22210.06s -> 22217.10s]  oh
[22218.54s -> 22227.13s]  in the top recedar stream worldwide it's probably because i'm the only
[22227.13s -> 22232.63s]  recedar stream worldwide that's probably what's going on
[22242.98s -> 22246.42s]  moonlighter has a much less impressive haggle system and the combat is a lot more repetitive
[22246.42s -> 22250.50s]  unfortunately i'd say the game is much more this game is much more fleshed out
[22252.10s -> 22256.82s]  really come on give me one more one more so we can see it ah come on
[22260.66s -> 22267.80s]  do the anime voice no it's too late like two or three hours ago when i was like

[23712.22s -> 23716.90s]  sardines by the way there's only one brand you should be purchasing and that's king oscar
[23718.25s -> 23727.13s]  king oscar boneless and seedless seed boneless and skinless sardines in oil boneless and
[23727.13s -> 23733.53s]  skinless sardines in oil king oscar they come in a tin you fold them back put them on smash
[23733.53s -> 23737.77s]  them up put them on a little bit of toast maybe add a little bit of mayonnaise to that
[23737.77s -> 23750.47s]  or a tomato on top you may have you may have not have eaten them correctly king oscar
[23750.47s -> 23756.28s]  they're the best i don't look i don't do sponsorships i just tell you the truth
[23756.28s -> 23765.40s]  about what i believe king oscar sardines are the best baskin robin's mom's cookies ice cream
[23765.40s -> 23769.00s]  is the best you don't have to pay me to say that i'm just i'm telling you a fact
[23773.45s -> 23777.45s]  king oscar doesn't have to come here and give me a thousand dollars to do an anime
[23777.45s -> 23793.14s]  voice i'm just gonna speak facts why would he sponsor after 2 000 people just left anyway
[23793.14s -> 23798.86s]  well this is the end of the spring if i had a sponsorship i would have been probably required
[23798.86s -> 23811.14s]  to do it peak viewership anyways sardines are really good another boomer food that you should
[23811.14s -> 23821.40s]  try uh let me think about this it's just food it's not boomer food canned fish is really
[23821.40s -> 23825.00s]  good for you and it's really tastes good as long as you do it right canned tuna canned
[23825.00s -> 23833.85s]  sardines anchovies they are good if you can just get over it how weird and strange and
[23833.85s -> 23851.14s]  gross television has told you they are you're gonna enjoy them canned tuna is great did it try
[23851.14s -> 23861.13s]  pasta with uh pasta casserole uh what uh pasta with tuna no tuna casserole and pasta casserole
[23861.13s -> 23873.45s]  i'm a fucking idiot tuna casserole is a really good boomer food look it up but thank you for
[23873.45s -> 23879.38s]  the 250 hope you can retry sardines when you get the right brand snooze and cough
[23879.46s -> 23882.34s]  thanks for the 250 hey germ i'm really looking forward to today's stream i haven't checked what
[23882.34s -> 23886.10s]  you're playing yet mainly because i can always trust you to choose a fun game and thanks to
[23886.10s -> 23891.54s]  your no anime game policy we don't have to watch stuff like that either i'm so proud of you
[23891.54s -> 23895.94s]  that you never break your policy that is what makes you so great and unique in my eyes
[23895.94s -> 23900.02s]  germa you're the best you never disappoint never that said i'm gonna open the stream
[23900.02s -> 23906.15s]  now i'm really excited you never fail us when did i ever say a no anime game policy
[23906.95s -> 23916.74s]  i've never had a no anime game policy before i said i watch one anime a year this is not an anime
[23921.90s -> 23926.22s]  i did not say that somebody can go find that if they really want to i never said there is a
[23926.22s -> 23937.61s]  no anime game policy on this stream was that some way for me to deflect not having to play
[23937.61s -> 23944.26s]  doki doki literature club because i got asked that every single day every moment of every
[23944.26s -> 23956.20s]  stream i think play doki doki literature club may have been in this chat more than germa moon
[23956.76s -> 23967.38s]  or more than half of my emotes for a period there i had to deflect it somehow you're an actual
[23967.38s -> 23974.82s]  liar i've already told everybody here that 90 80 to 90 percent of everything i say in this
[23974.82s -> 23980.34s]  stream is not real and i always clarify when things are real like for instance
[23980.42s -> 23986.66s]  baskin robbins ice cream is the best that ice cream mom's cookies i said before this is one
[23986.66s -> 24006.98s]  of the 10 things that i say on stream that's real and then i continue to say that sometimes
[24006.98s -> 24013.96s]  it's too easy sometimes it's too easy guys come on but thank you snooze and copter for the
[24013.96s -> 24018.36s]  five dollars they say dot dot dot dot after writing all that so i don't think they were
[24018.36s -> 24027.82s]  uh they may have been a little disappointed chocolate fudge brownie is the best ice cream
[24027.82s -> 24039.56s]  get wrecked jupiter face let's ban this guy real quick oh how do i turn off um
[24041.16s -> 24053.22s]  hold on actually just did that what was his name did i even do the right person
[24057.77s -> 24076.81s]  how do you untie about somebody all right there we go there we go i got they say wow
[24081.27s -> 24089.69s]  you banned someone from pointing out the truth i already i unbanned him i had banned
[24089.85s -> 24096.28s]  it wasn't even banned i do it was a small time out of 10 minutes but if you're going to say
[24096.28s -> 24102.92s]  something so so awful like chocolate fudge brownies better than moms making cookies
[24102.92s -> 24108.86s]  i feel like you've gotta go for at least enough for me to not have to look at it
[24119.06s -> 24125.34s]  anyways anyways anyways thank you to uh abomination zero for the five dollars thank
[24125.34s -> 24128.30s]  you for another great night jeremy you've done so much for me and i'd really like to start
[24128.30s -> 24133.98s]  streaming myself make it look like so much fun how the hell do you do it by having fun
[24134.70s -> 24145.48s]  it's important if you cannot reliably enjoy yourself on stream then it's kind of hard for
[24145.48s -> 24160.54s]  other people too as well except when you play mario maker it's one exception but uh good luck
[24160.54s -> 24174.54s]  to you i wish you the best i've been watching since 2011 so you've been doing something right
[24176.92s -> 24187.56s]  um i don't know if that's just up to you though you know if you've been watching for that long
[24188.12s -> 24193.21s]  then i hope you do think i'm doing something right but there i mean there are plenty of people
[24193.21s -> 24197.85s]  that have watched in come and gone and and that's fine too there may be people that
[24197.85s -> 24201.56s]  have come to this channel and said i don't really like this and left you kind of just
[24201.56s -> 24215.29s]  have to find the community that speaks to you you know i don't really like this
[24216.25s -> 24229.05s]  no i can't like time that i'm not going to do that this streamer only makes loud noises
[24230.73s -> 24236.81s]  it's been seven hours okay i probably made like 12 loud noises so it was like 18 to 20 seconds
[24236.81s -> 24242.25s]  of loud noises in seven hours that is less than like a quarter of a percent of loud noise time
[24242.25s -> 24255.91s]  on screen so come on give me a little bit of a slack here a wiki this thanks for the 15

[24344.23s -> 24350.12s]  touch on that and also speaking of subs here comes the credits by the way this should be a new
[24350.12s -> 24354.84s]  screen here and a couple of new things to listen to music wise while blordow continues to
[24355.80s -> 24359.96s]  chip away at all the new stuff i'll probably implementing that over the next couple of streams
[24360.92s -> 24369.85s]  it might take um like into next week but you should see it really soon and the credits
[24369.85s -> 24373.37s]  are gonna roll right now thank you to everybody that subs to this channel thanks everybody

[24387.50s -> 24391.98s]  subs than what you're seeing on screen right now but because the stream cut off in half
[24394.10s -> 24399.30s]  three two or three hours ago i believe we may have lost the first two or three hours of
[24399.30s -> 24406.78s]  people that have subscribed in the first couple hours so i'm sorry to say that because technically
[24406.78s -> 24412.30s]  a new stream had to start because i'm not even sure that was a cox thing i think that was a
[24412.30s -> 24429.51s]  twitch thing but regardless thank you everybody for something there's a lot of you old bits
[24429.51s -> 24440.49s]  got deleted uh they no they shouldn't they're here i got them here yeah they should be fine
