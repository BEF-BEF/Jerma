[1.46s -> 15.85s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Uh, Jerma here with a Terraria gameplay. Hi! Uh, we're gonna finish
[15.85s -> 25.08s]  Terraria tonight, today. Knew that was coming. Yeah, I'm pretty predictable. Uh, we're gonna finish
[25.08s -> 32.38s]  Terraria. At least the base game, Star and I. Uh, this is, might be a shorter stream. I wouldn't
[32.38s -> 37.50s]  lock yourself in like the last couple streams for eight hours or so. We're gonna finish the game,
[37.50s -> 44.58s]  chill, and see what happens after that. We'll see. I will give an update on the activity book,
[44.58s -> 48.90s]  which has been pushed because obviously I wanted more time people to do stuff. We'll talk about
[48.90s -> 58.25s]  that after Terraria. Gonna be a chill stream. I think he's trying to talk to me, but I told him
[58.25s -> 69.90s]  I do a full five minute broadcaster intro. I can see the thing lighting up on, uh, on Discord. He's
[69.90s -> 79.59s]  trying to talk to me. What is it? I saw your thing lighten up. I thought you were trying to
[79.59s -> 84.47s]  get a hold of me. Oh no, I was talking to the people and telling them that it feels like I
[84.47s -> 90.33s]  threw my left arm out, but I haven't used my left arm for like a year, so I don't know what's wrong.
[90.97s -> 95.29s]  Sleep on it wrong? And then you told me to take some glycycerols. That's not what I said.
[98.17s -> 105.22s]  Hypoglycerin? No, that's not correct. That's incorrect. What did you tell me? I told you.
[106.02s -> 113.18s]  Glucosamine and chondroitin. Oh, what does that do? Where do I get it? You get it anywhere.
[114.38s -> 120.26s]  It's good for your joints. It's good for your cartilage. Oh, it's not even that. My chat's
[120.26s -> 127.35s]  telling me it's cancer. I don't think I would just always take care of your health. It's important.
[129.40s -> 140.06s]  For your health. But we're going to beat this game. Are we? Yeah. Didn't you tell me this is
[140.06s -> 146.46s]  going to be like... Are you stuck in the room? No, I'm doing my intro. No, you're stuck in the room.
[146.46s -> 151.74s]  What do you mean stuck in the room? You're stuck in the room. You'll know when you get to the game.
[151.74s -> 162.49s]  I'm in the game. You're stuck in the room. How did I get in here? I don't know. Well, I know how to
[162.49s -> 169.42s]  get out. You would destroy that house for your own gain. You're free. You're free. Get out quick.
[170.06s -> 175.45s]  This is your chance to get out. He's a fucking monster. Get out quick.
[180.14s -> 187.82s]  Yeah, that's why I cut their ears off. You're a sick fuck. All right. So where do we go from here?
[188.54s -> 192.94s]  What was the last thing we did three years ago? Where are we? I don't know. Last thing I remember
[192.94s -> 199.82s]  is you built an entire teleporting around town tunnel system. Oh, yeah. Hey, welcome to episode
[199.82s -> 204.70s]  number 74 of Let's Play Terraria. I built these teleporter pads to give us a little bit of an
[204.70s -> 209.18s]  easier time getting around. You just stand on top of the teleporter and you right click the switch.
[209.18s -> 215.40s]  Hey, look, and we're at the dungeon. This is actually the next boss. Oh, nice. So I helped
[215.40s -> 222.52s]  with this if anyone's curious. Oh, yeah. Jerma did this one. He gets full credit. I was about
[222.52s -> 225.96s]  placement. I was saying, hey, we should probably put them in different places. I looked up some
[225.96s -> 229.32s]  stuff about Terraria. I wanted to be prepared for this stream. So I said some of the teleporters
[229.32s -> 235.00s]  should be in front of the new bosses. Some should be in other areas that are involved in the plot
[235.00s -> 240.68s]  of the game too. So we can see the story play out the plot. Yeah, the plot. What's the plot so far?
[240.68s -> 255.69s]  Just to catch everyone up. So you get dropped off outside. Are we going to fight it? We're going to
[256.89s -> 264.42s]  and when you dropped off outside, there's you have to use an island situation, I think.
[266.12s -> 273.08s]  Yeah, because this is an island, right? I mean, it could be. It could be. I mean, the whole goal is
[273.08s -> 277.16s]  we're just trying to figure out why we're here and how to get out. Yeah. And you have to build
[277.16s -> 282.74s]  the spaceship to get off. Yes. Because we're about halfway done with the spaceship. But first,
[282.74s -> 289.30s]  we need to kill the cultists while the Martians invade. OK. OK, that will make this harder.
[294.65s -> 297.53s]  Oh, I remember this. Remember when I went, whoa, what the fuck, dude,
[299.53s -> 309.93s]  something just happened, man. So it's been like three weeks since we last played.
[310.09s -> 312.89s]  How do you keep asking? Like, oh, my God, I clicked out of the window.
[314.09s -> 319.30s]  You keep asking, like, when are we done? OK, well, we kill this boss and then there's one
[319.30s -> 322.58s]  more and then we're done. So hopefully we can end this stream in 20 minutes because this.
[324.02s -> 333.58s]  What do you mean ended in 20 minutes? I think that's what the fans want. Oh, shit. Let's heal.
[333.58s -> 340.14s]  I got it. H. I mean, I've played this game before. Am I missing him?
[341.10s -> 350.73s]  I know you guys are your guys are all getting them. All right. He's almost at 28 percent. I see.
[350.73s -> 359.88s]  He's up. He's that one. Oh, I can feel the DPS. Three percent, one percent dots.
[360.52s -> 367.67s]  Game's over. We didn't do this. No, what's here? Here's what here's what you're going to look at.
[367.67s -> 372.87s]  You press anything on the map. Yeah. Uh huh. You see on the on the top of the map,
[372.87s -> 375.83s]  there's these icons for the nebula pillar. There's these different pillars.
[376.79s -> 380.79s]  Actually, there's one in our base. Everyone's dead again. Everyone's dead.
[380.79s -> 388.49s]  Huh? And we go home and everyone will be dead. That's just a fact because the pillar spawned
[388.49s -> 394.73s]  on our base. Once we destroy all four of those pillars, you immediately fight the final boss
[394.73s -> 406.36s]  and then we're done. It doesn't take like a while. It could take a very long time to do this.
[406.36s -> 411.91s]  You know, got any like side tracking stories and like what happened moments
[411.91s -> 415.83s]  we could do while we dig down for an hour and 25 minutes? Well, they're supposed. Oh,
[415.83s -> 420.39s]  actually the Martians are also at our base. Here's let's say let's take this teleporter
[422.06s -> 427.82s]  if you're ready for like pure chaos. Is it going to be pure chaos? Uh, if you fly higher than like
[427.82s -> 436.49s]  six feet, you'll die. What? Because of this pillar. Just on that. There's these things that fly around
[436.49s -> 448.92s]  in the sky that don't want you to fly. Oh, okay. Going good. So don't jump in the air.
[449.72s -> 457.61s]  You see like the worms in the sky? They like one shot you if you go too high. Oh, God. What if I
[462.33s -> 470.57s]  I don't know what fucking heal is. Turma. Turma. I tried Z. What if I rebounded like a month ago
[470.57s -> 478.76s]  and I don't even remember what the fuck I bound it to. Oh, God. That is over here, isn't it? That's
[478.76s -> 492.44s]  scary. So, oh, and the Martians. So what do we need to focus on here? After you kill like I think
[492.44s -> 500.15s]  it's 150 of the solar enemies, then you can destroy the pillar. You kill 150 enemies? Yeah.
[504.41s -> 507.77s]  Mage one trick the wizard. What the fuck?
[508.41s -> 518.81s]  Okay. Mage one trick the wizard. Is one trick their nickname? I don't know. Apparently,
[518.81s -> 525.29s]  he's only good at being a mage. I mean, that would be good enough for me. Get out of here. Get out
[525.29s -> 539.03s]  of our base. And as soon as we destroy the pillar, like a UFO is gonna show up.
[543.88s -> 550.30s]  I don't even know what's happening. Dude, I'm about to drive through today.
[550.30s -> 554.78s]  You never believe what happened. What happened at this drive? I had this dream.
[555.74s -> 572.54s]  I had this dream that I was at the drive through. Just so you get the full terraria experience.
[572.54s -> 578.15s]  I'll let you pick those up. Yeah. What is it? What is it? I'll allow it. Pick up what?
[578.79s -> 583.67s]  Where the pillar was, there's a whole bunch of solar fragments and they wow, dude. Wow. Do they
[583.67s -> 587.11s]  sure? Do they craft some stuff? Actually, can't we not do that yet? Because they don't have the
[587.11s -> 593.83s]  ancient manipulator. Well, I mean, to be fair, you did like delete a mod or two from the game,
[593.83s -> 604.55s]  so I don't even know some items don't exist anymore. I'm getting like chunk errors.
[605.75s -> 618.78s]  Are you though? Yeah, I am. No, I'm picking them up. You guys thought that was a joke. No,
[618.78s -> 627.98s]  I have like errors in my inventory. Well, German didn't summon all these Martians.
[628.62s -> 640.74s]  And some angels. Oh, yeah. Oh, he's playing the playing the fool. I see. What the hell is it?
[640.74s -> 653.61s]  What is this thing? Where does this teleporter go to? Which one? The one that's like underneath
[653.61s -> 663.00s]  the Marsha. All right. There's the saucer. OK, attention span for that teleporter gone.
[665.88s -> 669.80s]  One of them goes down to the midway point of all the shitty NPCs and the other one goes all the
[669.80s -> 677.74s]  way down to hell. Oh, you really did like do all of that, huh? Yeah. And then one of them goes to
[677.74s -> 688.94s]  the jungle and one of them goes to the dungeon. Game's over. Not yet. First, we have to kill
[688.94s -> 713.27s]  Naruto and then Bardo comes for revenge. Oh, a lot of help. Watch out for this UFO. I see it.
[714.23s -> 726.20s]  Watch out for the UFO. Close the door. Let my minions do it.
[729.05s -> 737.61s]  I want to fight. Was that with UFO? OK, by you. It's dead. Nice work. Dang.
[739.05s -> 744.82s]  Oh, there's a bunch in the background. You can shoot those for me.
[745.86s -> 755.43s]  All the UFOs in the background? Yeah. Dude, this is like just I'm burning so much
[755.43s -> 760.39s]  mana with this weapon. I need to get rid of this thing. It's good. But did you did you get the
[762.25s -> 765.93s]  the ice frost summon staff that I told you to get a good boy?
[767.13s -> 769.69s]  Before the screen started, I was like, hey, German, you're going to need to get this.
[769.69s -> 773.61s]  It's very good at this stage of the game. I've got the frost staff on right now.
[780.20s -> 780.52s]  Use it.
[780.52s -> 790.12s]  Oh, they're all dead. No, they're not. Oh, I thought it was going to drop by everybody.
[790.12s -> 794.84s]  What's not fighting me? What's it doing? It's over here trying to shoot me desperately.
[796.60s -> 801.32s]  It's dead. All right, we got it. Is there going to be another one? There's two.
[802.20s -> 805.64s]  This one is smarter. It's holding down left mouse button. They don't understand.
[805.88s -> 819.37s]  Get the car key. Yeah, get the car key. I got a swimmer. That guy, he knows what he's talking about.
[820.17s -> 829.82s]  I got a key. All right. Use the car key. Do I get to go? Wait, you tell me I get to fly
[831.05s -> 838.94s]  and get the fly in a car. You stole an UFO. Well, hold on. Once he's done,
[838.94s -> 867.14s]  he just spawned right on top of those. Oh, whoa. He just one hit killed me with that.
[867.86s -> 873.21s]  Yeah, that does a lot of damage. Now, you know, it's for next time. All right.
[874.01s -> 880.15s]  For next time. Yeah, because we're starting a new run, right? It's been a while since we last
[880.15s -> 884.15s]  played. I think it's just better off we start from the beginning. I already have 380 health.
[884.47s -> 893.37s]  Oh, yeah, there's in the storage, there's life fruits and you should be able to get to 400.
[894.73s -> 898.09s]  I don't remember because I took off the mod where we died.
[900.87s -> 902.95s]  How did I just click out of the window? Why is that possible?
[905.03s -> 911.34s]  I feel like I'm getting hit and it takes me like two hits to die here.
[915.43s -> 919.54s]  That shouldn't be happening, right? Well, you do have summoner armor, so maybe
[919.94s -> 928.12s]  that's that's kind of is what happens, but it's unfortunate, but my summons are so cool
[930.12s -> 938.18s]  that it's worth it. There's so much random shit on the ground. I don't know what any of
[938.18s -> 955.72s]  this does, but I'm going to get it. I guess the there's like, use, use your UFO. Okay. Well,
[955.72s -> 965.13s]  hold on. Are we safe or where's that car key? Okay. Cosmic car key summons a rideable UFO.
[966.09s -> 972.76s]  Yeah, use your UFO. I'm going to keep saying it until you laugh. So like just laugh and get it
[972.76s -> 986.74s]  over with. Oh, what a nice UFO. Wow. This is last forever? Yeah. Really? Yeah. So I just get to be
[986.74s -> 992.58s]  Bowser the rest of the game. This is great. All right. I'm never taking this off. You can't drop
[992.58s -> 1000.41s]  any Koopas though. That's all right. I'm never coming out of this seat. I'm going to be like
[1000.49s -> 1005.37s]  fucking crank for the remaining times we played this game. All right. What about your old
[1006.09s -> 1021.13s]  case? It's a mouth slot. What does it blessed apple unicorn? It's not a UFO. So who cares?
[1021.13s -> 1025.69s]  That's true. All right. This is important though. There's a lot of so many things that are
[1025.69s -> 1037.99s]  overwhelming my brain. All right. I'm going to get um, is the staff anti-gravity anti-gravity hook?
[1038.07s -> 1044.31s]  Does that ring a bell? Anti-gravity hook. I think it's just a hook. Is it a cool hook? Is it better
[1044.31s -> 1048.47s]  than what I think I have? It's the one I think I have. I don't know what I think you have.
[1053.30s -> 1064.38s]  Come on. I can't get in here. Bullshit. Let me, let me do this. Where's Mr. Craft?
[1064.38s -> 1068.22s]  The German has finished telling the dream. What dream? I don't even remember you saying
[1068.22s -> 1080.94s]  there was a dream. Alpha ray and two wingman, 15 dark sun fragments, a genesis and a galactica
[1080.94s -> 1092.14s]  singularity. Yeah. Damn it. I can't do that. I already told the dream story. I told the whole,
[1092.14s -> 1099.90s]  I had like three, I had a full dream thing like two days ago. I already told it. Oh, I was doing
[1099.90s -> 1104.62s]  a, I was like running like the previously on German nine eight five, like two or three streams
[1104.62s -> 1113.74s]  ago. All right. Let me do the thing that I always do. And that is just, I don't care.
[1115.98s -> 1120.78s]  Tell dream or riot. I'm sorry. I have to, I just, that's what I do. I deposit all.
[1122.44s -> 1127.08s]  I mean, at this point, at this point, who gives a shit doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. And I gotta
[1127.08s -> 1132.90s]  say, I played, I told you, I played through a game with Ashley and she really wasn't better than you
[1132.90s -> 1139.53s]  about sticking random shit right in the storage. I thought she knew better. And yet we had like
[1139.53s -> 1148.01s]  40 slots filled with banners. Look, we don't know what's good and not good. We just want to make
[1148.01s -> 1158.14s]  sure that we have everything we have at all. All right. Did anything, what was I trying to do?
[1159.96s -> 1164.92s]  I was trying to make something. I'm trying to make something for
[1164.92s -> 1171.22s]  someone's, the legendary valor for to assault enemies and blow them away.
[1172.81s -> 1175.85s]  Well, you're going to want the legendary valor for what the fuck is the valor for
[1176.97s -> 1181.94s]  what the fuck? I didn't know I had this guy. It's a Pokemon. I think I gave that to you.
[1183.14s -> 1186.42s]  Why can I, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a summoner. Why can I not have like five of these?
[1187.46s -> 1191.78s]  I think it's only one for that one item. I told you to get the, the ice frost thing from this guy.
[1192.58s -> 1205.54s]  Look from, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Get the ice frost. I'm not the cryogenic frost cryogenic staff.
[1205.54s -> 1215.16s]  I need some money. I got plenty of that. Like 20 platinum in there. Okay. Is this better than my,
[1215.96s -> 1223.27s]  is this better than my like Lovecraftian guys? Someone's an animated ice concert to protect you
[1223.27s -> 1232.66s]  fire and why do I know what, why do I want this annoying cryogenic staff? Yeah. So I have to
[1232.66s -> 1245.74s]  reroll this because it sucks. All right. Okay. So whenever you want to, whenever you want to beat
[1248.42s -> 1254.74s]  hurtful cryogenic staff, let's go. Fuck. I said, I wasn't going to make that a thing on the channel
[1254.74s -> 1263.50s]  and it's like too late. So what the fuck is this? This is, this is like, this is not a summon. It's
[1263.50s -> 1272.76s]  a century. I like all this stuff. This is cool. This thing takes too much mana. I don't like it.
[1274.10s -> 1279.24s]  I'll like have to switch to it randomly. I do like this thing though. All right.
[1279.96s -> 1293.00s]  Um, I'm ready to do whatever you want to do. I know. Let me get all my summons and let's replace
[1295.06s -> 1303.45s]  this. Then I could go, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. Okay. All right. What do I got for potions?
[1303.45s -> 1311.26s]  32, 14. Oh, where's the, uh, you said there was, um, something to heal me to give me more health or
[1311.26s -> 1324.22s]  something more max health. Is there something in the inventory? Oh, I pressed the letter L so I
[1324.22s -> 1332.33s]  muted. I'm sorry. Um, what's the, uh, in the inventory? What? Uh, you said there was something
[1332.33s -> 1338.52s]  in the inventory. I said there was something in the inventory for max health. Oh, life fruits,
[1340.04s -> 1349.19s]  life fruit. So I just take, take all this. I can just take all these you're saying I'm going to
[1349.19s -> 1360.55s]  take them all. I'm eating all the fruit. Is that all right with you? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Use them.
[1361.91s -> 1373.53s]  Oh, why is it not working? Don't throw it. Oh yeah. Good job. Way to go. Take one first.
[1374.41s -> 1379.77s]  You're looking healthier already, buddy. You muted again. How is that possible? I didn't press L.
[1380.65s -> 1384.17s]  Well, you know what? You know, if you don't want to talk to me, that's fine. I need to have 400
[1384.17s -> 1392.84s]  health to be able to eat these. Oh, you need life crystals? I think because I turned off the other
[1392.84s -> 1398.60s]  goofy thing. You turned off the mod. See? Okay. There's, there's 23 life crystals in here. You,
[1398.60s -> 1406.09s]  you've got it. Oh, it's cause I'm pressing L. Yeah. I'm pressing L for life crystal.
[1410.10s -> 1417.29s]  Oh, that's, that's funny. All right. So take these. Now I'm at 400. Can I? All right. Now take these.
[1420.26s -> 1425.94s]  There we go. That's better. That's what I'm talking about there. I'm good. I'm ready to go.
[1426.66s -> 1429.94s]  Ready to go beat the game. I'm ready. It's ready to go beat the game. That's it.
[1430.74s -> 1437.35s]  Okay. On the map, let's uh, hey, hey, let's use the new teleporter system. Wait, I want potions.
[1437.91s -> 1457.48s]  Where's the potion guy? Is the potion guy dead? Is it Howard? It's Howard, right? No.
[1462.15s -> 1467.14s]  I don't think the potion guy's alive. Hold on. I think there's a different one
[1467.94s -> 1472.58s]  because I got a better potion mod, but I think he's like way downstairs. Oh, did you move somebody?
[1473.46s -> 1488.31s]  Getting to the bottom of this. You made all these teleporters on my instructions, of course,
[1488.31s -> 1492.07s]  but you made these teleporters and I don't think you remember what you did.
[1497.19s -> 1504.86s]  You talking shit? Yeah. All right. I'll just delete the teleporter. He thinks he's at the end.
[1504.86s -> 1515.51s]  Oh, hello. You think we care for him or not? I didn't, I didn't talk about, but it's like funny.
[1516.63s -> 1520.55s]  So like a few weeks ago when we were trying to figure out like, hey, when do you want to do this
[1520.55s -> 1527.21s]  again? You had already played through like a full another time, like on expert. Yep. Me and me and
[1527.21s -> 1534.33s]  Ashley, we had a, we had a hankering for some more Terraria and we played on Revengeance Expert and
[1534.33s -> 1539.85s]  beat like the whole thing. And then it like that same week, he was supposed to play Terraria with
[1539.85s -> 1545.53s]  me on like baby mode. And you were like, do you still like want to do this? And I'm like, yeah.
[1545.53s -> 1548.65s]  You're like, you sure like, you don't want to like, you're not sick of that or anything. And I'm like,
[1548.65s -> 1565.77s]  no, I like this game. Fun. Well, you know what? Yeah. I don't know if the NPCs on didn't yet
[1565.77s -> 1571.19s]  with the potions. This is good because I can't die. I can no longer die from fall damage. So what?
[1571.19s -> 1581.18s]  I don't have potions, whatever. Screw it. Let's go. Have you played Super Mario RPG?
[1582.79s -> 1589.56s]  Uh, a long time ago. Stream it tomorrow. Oh, that teleporter goes right into the other one.
[1589.64s -> 1601.80s]  Dude, I planned this so well. Whoa. What a God. He knew. What is this thing here?
[1601.80s -> 1613.35s]  Isn't that a pillar? Yeah, there's four of them. I'll have you know throughout our entire
[1613.35s -> 1618.63s]  Terraria playthrough where me and Ashley beat the game together. Uh, most boss fights we quoted
[1618.63s -> 1626.87s]  a classic drama quote. Isn't building this platform cheating? What do you mean? What is that? What do
[1626.87s -> 1630.95s]  you mean classic? That's the one thing I took away from us playing together is that building
[1630.95s -> 1636.07s]  platforms to fight bosses is cheating. I didn't know. I think you would, I think you would really
[1636.07s -> 1640.47s]  think it was funny. The one thing that we built, there's a, you remember the giant mech head,
[1641.59s -> 1648.71s]  the skeleton head with the big arms swinging around. So we made a giant railroad in the sky
[1649.27s -> 1653.43s]  that goes on a diamond and it goes too fast. So he can't catch you and he just stays in the middle
[1653.43s -> 1660.41s]  spinning and actually had so much defense. We can only do one damage to him. So he AFKed
[1661.05s -> 1663.69s]  until it was dead for like 30 minutes.
[1670.50s -> 1676.97s]  That's so stupid. Why am I fighting ice with ice? Isn't that a mistake? I don't know. Yeah,
[1676.97s -> 1684.82s]  I think you're healing them. I love being Bowser. This is great. I would have died like three times
[1684.82s -> 1700.92s]  by now. Ow, don't kill me. Come on. Dude, heal. What's the heal button? Press L. I do. I just get
[1700.92s -> 1708.31s]  hurt. I get killed so I get hurt. When anything touches me, it does like six hearts. Maybe you
[1708.31s -> 1715.42s]  should get armor. This is your doing. You said be the summoner so I can have constant DPS because
[1715.42s -> 1722.78s]  I don't trust you. You can focus on dodging because you don't have to attack. David, I want to attack.
[1723.50s -> 1735.53s]  Just dodge. Just dodge. I died. Or you can just always use that teleporter to get right back.
[1736.25s -> 1762.71s]  Which teleporter was it? I forget. The one on the roof. Yeah, I get confused if my enemies are not
[1763.51s -> 1773.40s]  projectiles or if they're my projectiles. Whose projectiles are who? It's almost over. You can go
[1773.40s -> 1783.67s]  back to your Mario RPG. Don't even talk shit about Mario RPG. So how many times do you jump on an
[1783.67s -> 1789.30s]  enemy's head before they die? You do the chain combo jumps when you attack. You just sit there
[1789.30s -> 1797.46s]  and hit a 20 chain. Everyone else is doing the sleep phase. You turned the stream on for five
[1797.46s -> 1802.82s]  minutes when I was trying to do the ultra achievement. Why do you know that? Because
[1802.82s -> 1810.02s]  I said I played it a long time ago. Did you ever do the 100 super jumps in a row? I don't think so.
[1810.66s -> 1816.34s]  I think I actually didn't play it and I watched my brother play it if I had to guess. I almost
[1816.42s -> 1822.90s]  had a meltdown trying to get it. I got to like 38 without like save states. You ever play Vagrant
[1822.90s -> 1831.99s]  Story? No. Very good game. It's the Dark Souls of before Dark Souls was a thing. For the PS1,
[1831.99s -> 1838.31s]  I would recommend it. I mean, you like old games. I do. It also has the Super Mario RPG mechanic
[1838.31s -> 1846.20s]  where if you hit and you attack, you know, you can do another attack. Timed hits. Yeah. Very good.
[1846.36s -> 1851.96s]  Very, very good. Cool. You know, I'm just going to wait 30 more years for the roadmap and we can
[1851.96s -> 1859.80s]  all enjoy it because it's really awkward. There's like no sound in the game. There's no sound.
[1860.44s -> 1868.15s]  There's sound, but it's it's like PS1 era and everyone has a square face and there's no actual
[1868.15s -> 1875.93s]  voice dialogue. It just everything's really quiet and claustrophobic. Anyway,
[1876.89s -> 1882.70s]  we're going. We're going back to the base. We got to go the other direction for the other pillars.
[1883.66s -> 1892.89s]  How many more pillars are there? Two. And then after we do the two pillars, we then combine them
[1892.89s -> 1899.29s]  all. Your mind goes blank. You're not sure what's coming. But the stir told me it's the Moon Lord
[1899.29s -> 1906.22s]  and he then you got to fight him. So I teleported back within the thing and yeah, I can't get out
[1906.22s -> 1911.66s]  now. I'm stuck again. I need to rebuild this. Oh, don't worry. That person has a clone.
[1919.00s -> 1923.48s]  We just made them meet for the first time and look at this. They're like, oh my God, are you me?
[1923.48s -> 1926.68s]  What was in the prison cell next to you the whole time? How long have you been here for?
[1928.31s -> 1934.65s]  God, I've seen maybe two or three years. They got a lot to talk about. So that I'm okay with that.
[1935.53s -> 1939.69s]  No, unfortunately, they don't count as rooms anymore and they're both going to escape. Good.
[1939.69s -> 1945.75s]  Good. They'll have their own like fucking Nickelodeon TV show. All right. You ready?
[1945.75s -> 1959.66s]  They'll be on Cartoon Network. All right. I'm yes, I'm ready. How about for Moon Lord? Like I don't
[1959.66s -> 1975.46s]  attack him. I just like let you do it. No, that's not fair. Oh, easy. He jumped. Just I'll just
[1976.50s -> 1981.86s]  I'll play support. No, I'm going to do the technique where I just don't. I just run around. I
[1982.42s -> 1987.78s]  just don't try not to get hit. Actually, I think Moon Lord, I think you outrun him with the UFO
[1987.78s -> 1996.82s]  like very slightly. I can't remember. I can always build a railroad for space, but I think that's
[1996.82s -> 2021.18s]  cheating. Space railroad. That sounds kind of fun. Yeah, I'm just trying not to get hit. If I get hit
[2021.18s -> 2027.86s]  three or four times, I'm dead. What is that light steel? Is it life leech in this game?
[2028.74s -> 2033.94s]  Oh, there's one really dumb accessory that I'm using that for you, man. It's really easy to
[2033.94s -> 2041.54s]  get item and it's the best item in every mod I've played. You take you take like 50% more damage,
[2041.54s -> 2047.46s]  but when you take 25% more damage, but under 50% health, you have 25% light steel.
[2047.94s -> 2050.98s]  As long as you're shooting, you don't die. That's pretty awesome.
[2053.80s -> 2056.60s]  Yeah, it's like if you just want to like vegetate out. Whoa, whoa, get off me.
[2058.20s -> 2067.69s]  It's really the go-to. Somebody said fighting Moon Lord with ancient ice chunk and they said
[2067.69s -> 2085.02s]  not like this. What is that? Why is that a bad thing? They seem to think so, but it's normal.
[2093.72s -> 2107.11s]  Okay. Before we do the last pillar, we can actually go do a boss and we'll get you a better
[2107.11s -> 2126.60s]  summon. Oh, what? Watch out. Watch out. All right. I'm going to dodge. Am I like shut off? Why can
[2126.60s -> 2133.10s]  I not do anything? What's wrong with me? Some enemies have a debuff that'll disable your UFO.
[2133.10s -> 2145.42s]  This guy might have it. I have my summons. I'm just trying to avoid it. No. Oh, please. No,
[2145.42s -> 2155.82s]  don't kill me. They're like in the background. Thank you. They're in the background of my game.
[2156.38s -> 2171.45s]  It's funny. Like I'm pretending I can be hurt. It's for the stream. Wait, how did I end up this
[2171.45s -> 2180.44s]  far away from you? Oh God. Where's the closest teleporter? Uh, you can open the map and teleport
[2180.44s -> 2186.60s]  to me. I can be hurt. What just happened? Uh, and then you click on me if you have the potions.
[2186.60s -> 2201.88s]  Why did I end up here in funky town? How did I end up in funky town? I'm just going to fucking
[2201.88s -> 2225.18s]  fly to you. I'm coming home. Am I not gaining? Okay. So you press the M. I don't know. I don't
[2225.18s -> 2233.05s]  have a port to me. I don't have the potions. Are you teleport to funky town? I teleported to funky
[2233.13s -> 2239.21s]  town and that was like the checkpoint for me to get over to you. What is this? Another one.
[2239.21s -> 2244.25s]  Okay. There's another guy over here. There's a, I just, I think I just, I'm gonna, I got bad news
[2244.25s -> 2256.01s]  for you. Um, bringing over the last pillar. Uh, the part of the move. Oh, I don't kill it. I'll be
[2256.01s -> 2267.26s]  there in like 10 seconds. Just dodge, dodge, dodge. Don't kill it. 0.1. If I stop shooting,
[2267.26s -> 2277.08s]  I can take damage. Hold on. Hey, can you see my fire? Am I getting close? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2277.08s -> 2283.96s]  You got it, dude. That hit it. Did I get it? Yeah. What are you kidding me? Oh my God. I'm making a
[2283.96s -> 2290.95s]  montage just for that. I hit it from all the way back here. Dude. That's fucking awesome. Are you
[2290.95s -> 2298.73s]  serious? That's probably, I mean, has anyone ever done something like that before? Are we
[2298.73s -> 2310.12s]  summoning a boss here? Are we going to fight the, um, the teller? Hold on. Um, we can, we can also
[2310.12s -> 2323.78s]  make, hold, hold on. A lot of things are happening right now. Here. Okay. Here. Here. Now that guy
[2323.78s -> 2327.70s]  can stop laughing at you because you have a new summon staff. Say they left. They're gone. Oh,
[2327.70s -> 2333.06s]  that guy. They're going to, they're going to find themselves. Oh, that's great. No, not the guy in
[2333.06s -> 2338.82s]  chat. The two people. What two people? You don't even, how do you not remember that thing, that
[2338.82s -> 2343.14s]  really weird, fun thing that happened like less than five minutes ago? The thing you sent me?
[2345.83s -> 2353.21s]  Yes. Okay. So I started a cell staff, so I'm replacing this. Let's check this out. Oh, this is
[2353.21s -> 2359.34s]  the, uh, this thing that I gave the materials for last time, right? What? You have to unsummon your
[2359.34s -> 2379.37s]  other things. And where are they? All right. So I'm just a bubble guy now. Yeah. Now you're a bubble
[2379.37s -> 2387.13s]  guy. Yeah. Last time we played, I looked up some stuff on the Wikipedia and I said, like there was
[2387.13s -> 2389.85s]  some summons that I thought were cool. And I was like, what materials do we need? And I got some
[2389.85s -> 2394.09s]  off stream and then I just like, I'm just going to leave them in the box and next time we'll figure
[2394.09s -> 2398.41s]  it out. So you just, you just made it for me now just to kind of speed things up. So
[2408.06s -> 2417.22s]  all right. What else did I get? Astral Bulwark. $10 to kick Yerma from the server. It's not enough.
[2417.78s -> 2426.36s]  $10 to kick me from the server. You're going to have to add like five zeros. Yeah. How come
[2426.36s -> 2434.57s]  all of my donations are to ask Yerma things? That's what all mine are too. I don't even,
[2435.21s -> 2446.54s]  I don't even like this guy. Boy, that wasn't me. All right. So I want to, I want something
[2446.54s -> 2452.89s]  else besides the snowstorm staff. Maybe I should just put the zealous thing here and just use that.
[2453.77s -> 2461.69s]  I'm going to give that a try. That sounds like a lot of fun. Shut up. Shut up. What? It's in my
[2461.69s -> 2471.08s]  brain. What is in your brain? What are you talking about? Do you have any meld blobs?
[2472.04s -> 2481.48s]  Metal blobs? Meld blobs. What do they look like? Purple blobs. I should have way more of them.
[2481.48s -> 2489.06s]  Purple blobs. Oh wait, no, that's right. You have the thing that's like,
[2489.06s -> 2495.14s]  Hey Star, just wanted to ask you a question. You have one of those, don't you? I do. Star,
[2496.76s -> 2505.91s]  don't act like he doesn't have a name. Oh, you have one of those? That's very disrespectful.
[2506.87s -> 2517.48s]  I want to look, what can I make? I want to see what I can, can I turn this into something?
[2518.36s -> 2522.86s]  Yeah. What can I turn this into? All right. I can make Kevin's catalyst, which is
[2522.86s -> 2536.57s]  rogue damage. Now this is all melee damage and shit. There's actually a lot of things we can make
[2536.57s -> 2541.37s]  right before the end here because now we also get astral ore. You know what astral ore gets you?
[2542.33s -> 2548.23s]  What is that? Okay. Wait, first of all, I am going to get potions out of that inventory.
[2549.19s -> 2559.62s]  Inventory? Okay. I gave you $25, now kick Yerma. No, that's, he said like three zeros,
[2559.62s -> 2565.38s]  wasn't it? I mean, that's like, you're going to have to give Star like 10 grand to get rid of me.
[2567.24s -> 2579.51s]  Yeah. I mean, that's how much he's given me to play with him. So competing against a lot here.
[2579.51s -> 2596.30s]  Oh, here's $15. Okay. All right. So I want to do, what did I want to do? Potions.
[2596.38s -> 2601.22s]  Right. All right. Did you use the life fruit after you used the things you did, you know that?
[2601.22s -> 2616.87s]  I got 425. Yeah. One of these give me no mining potion. No, wouldn't have potion. No,
[2617.51s -> 2623.75s]  archery potion. Don't want it. Water walking, night owl, shine. All these potions suck. What
[2623.75s -> 2631.30s]  are you putting in here? Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, I wish we had a potion person so we could do
[2631.38s -> 2639.83s]  this. You told me that the guy was a new potion mod guy, but I don't think he showed up yet.
[2642.30s -> 2648.73s]  Excuse me for you adding and deleting mods. Fix those rooms. Actually, I think there's enough
[2648.73s -> 2679.90s]  empty ones. No, just fine. I'll fix it. Thank you. There's enough. Wait, don't be in it.
[2680.86s -> 2706.20s]  Shit. All right. Bubbles, get out of the way. All right. I fixed the room. Well, let's go here.
[2707.80s -> 2721.13s]  I've got my bubbles. I wish I had those potions. The potions really did help me so much. Um,
[2722.41s -> 2725.77s]  you know, we're just going to sit around and wait and tell some stories.
[2727.88s -> 2733.45s]  What stories do you have for me? All right. My arm, my shoulder really hurts. Well,
[2733.45s -> 2738.89s]  you have any recommend what I could have for this? Yes, I do. Well, I'm being dead serious now.
[2739.45s -> 2745.69s]  Is it like your like, like rotator cuff? Or I don't know what that means. Is it your shoulder?
[2745.69s -> 2749.45s]  Is it the like the joint inside your shoulder? Is it the muscle? Is it?
[2750.81s -> 2755.70s]  How did you sleep last night? If it helps, I can also dislocate the shoulder like on command.
[2756.66s -> 2760.10s]  You might have something. There might be something going. You might need to see. Um,
[2760.18s -> 2764.89s]  you might need to get, take, get that taken a look at. Oh, well, I've been able to do that
[2764.89s -> 2770.89s]  since I was like, like four years old. Oh, okay. But still, some, uh, the other kid,
[2770.89s -> 2775.45s]  he dragged me across my porch because we were playing a game and it pulled out of the socket
[2775.45s -> 2779.93s]  and it hurt a lot. But now I can just like pop it out and it's like whatever. You were playing a
[2779.93s -> 2789.27s]  game. Yeah. And it was what the fuck are you talking about? I was playing a game when I
[2789.27s -> 2794.39s]  was like four years old and the other kid was dragging me by my arm. What game requires you?
[2794.39s -> 2797.99s]  I can't remember. I was like four. I don't remember the game. It was some stupid game.
[2799.27s -> 2813.18s]  Okay. Checkers. Yeah. We're playing like checkers. Yeah. Yeah, it was checkers. I think actually.
[2817.54s -> 2829.62s]  All right. Oh, but anyways, um, now if you haven't like joint problems, joint pain,
[2829.62s -> 2833.78s]  I would, I would see a physician about it, but you might consider taking that. Then you might
[2833.78s -> 2841.74s]  consider taking some glucosamine, chondroitin compound. Should help a little bit. Okay. Yes,
[2841.74s -> 2851.05s]  I am not a doctor. Can you spell that for me? It's just like it sounds. Uh, try to spell that
[2851.05s -> 2867.32s]  for me. Okay. Okay. One more time. Glucosamine, chondroitin. What the hell is this? Strange plant.
[2871.26s -> 2878.62s]  Nice. What is the strange plant? That's like a, you turn the game on and you can find those
[2878.62s -> 2886.06s]  in the dirt like at minute one. Hey star, you should tell Jerma he don't need to pick up strange
[2886.06s -> 2895.83s]  plants. God, he's so dumb. No, they're not mean to you. Star. I don't think in your whole life,
[2895.83s -> 2909.43s]  no one's ever been mean to you. I don't know how you do it. How do you do it, man? What the heck is
[2910.39s -> 2918.60s]  that? That's just your Trump. No, it's not.
[2922.41s -> 2941.32s]  That's just, no, it's not. You guys need to get your ears cleaned. Yeah, guys. Come on. No,
[2941.32s -> 2950.09s]  I was wondering what's going on here. All right. You ready? Um, not yet. Cause I think it might be
[2950.09s -> 2959.93s]  a huge problem. Where is my, he's ready. I'm ready. No, I'm not. Where the fuck is my staff
[2959.93s -> 2972.84s]  that summons these things? Did you put it in? Did you auto-stash it? No, I got it. Here's a random
[2972.84s -> 2980.78s]  staff. Wait, no, where the fuck is it? Why is snowstorms staff here? I didn't do anything.
[2981.34s -> 2993.51s]  What the hell is this? No, what happened to my staff that summons the bubbles? What is going on
[2993.51s -> 2999.77s]  right now? What did I, did I do something? What did I do? You probably, okay. No, no, no. Yeah,
[2999.77s -> 3009.26s]  I did. I did. All right. We're good. Okay. We're going to, we're going to skip everything. Skip
[3009.26s -> 3012.38s]  everything. Why everything? We're going to, we're going to skip everything. Come up here.
[3014.22s -> 3018.46s]  Actually, I need potions for this. Don't you wish you could have potions for this?
[3018.46s -> 3034.49s]  Hello. Hello. What are you doing? Hello. Star is going to carry Jerma. I hope you guys understand
[3034.49s -> 3038.89s]  that this entire Terraria, Jerma, and Star play. Yeah, that's right. I'm on the front of the ticker.
[3039.45s -> 3049.13s]  This entire Jerma and Star play Terraria has been Star showing me this game while I sit behind him
[3049.13s -> 3055.77s]  in the chair and watch him play. Yeah. He just has an in-game point of view. And it's been great so
[3055.77s -> 3064.63s]  far. We should totally have this NPC by now. It's this, no, it's not this guy. This guy sells life.
[3071.02s -> 3086.52s]  Here, Carl. It's not Carl. I mean, you've been doing a whole lot of just interesting things.
[3087.40s -> 3091.45s]  No, get away. Get the fish. Wow. I just saved that goldfish's life.
[3093.45s -> 3102.42s]  Oh, this is Lucy. This is the person. She was here the whole time. You're the backseater while
[3102.42s -> 3108.42s]  Chad is the third guy across the room playing Fortnite. Jerma, get over here on Lucy. Lucy.
[3115.86s -> 3125.40s]  Time to get them all. Thorn's potion. Get two of them. Who cares? We got platinum.
[3126.04s -> 3130.44s]  There is a server crash if one of us is talking to her and you change which shop it is.
[3130.44s -> 3133.72s]  What? I'm not going to touch anything then. I'm just going to buy the things I know I want.
[3134.52s -> 3144.76s]  Okay. Okay. This is just, okay, here we go. Max number of minions. Get a few of those.
[3145.72s -> 3152.31s]  I need more money. Don't touch me. There's a bunch of platinum in there. Yeah. Yeah, there is.
[3153.83s -> 3163.53s]  Here comes the crash joke. Are you talking to Lucy right now?
[3164.41s -> 3173.30s]  Okay, you're not. Whoops. What? Are you? I just, I'm in, I am in Lucy's menu right now.
[3173.94s -> 3183.24s]  Don't do anything. This place is crazy with all this fungus. You know what I'm saying?
[3185.00s -> 3195.91s]  Hey Jerma, you know what I'm saying? City and skin. I want mana regeneration. More than that.
[3197.91s -> 3209.69s]  Titan. Battle? No. Hey Jerma. Max life? You're muted. I must have pressed L. I apologize
[3209.69s -> 3216.17s]  profusely. Do you know what I'm saying? Say it again. I don't know what you said. No.
[3220.65s -> 3231.54s]  Okay. I am ready to do whatever it is you want to do. I'm ready to see the end game.
[3234.31s -> 3251.93s]  One second. Okay, so this boss is from Thorium Mod and it's supposed to be fought after Moonlord,
[3251.93s -> 3257.58s]  but for some reason they decide it like, if you die they don't want it to despawn,
[3257.58s -> 3264.94s]  so it's really easy because it just never goes away. Okay. So it gives ridiculous absurd items
[3264.94s -> 3269.74s]  where you don't have to think anymore. You just put all the items on. Nice. So if you don't want
[3269.74s -> 3277.26s]  to think, all you got to do is beat like a three-stage boss. Okay. Was that it? The Simon says that
[3277.26s -> 3282.87s]  you just put down? Only usable at night. I think it's about to be night. How good are you at Simon
[3282.87s -> 3295.00s]  says? I'd say I'm Simon, right? How good am I at Simon? Yeah, the thing with like the five lights
[3295.00s -> 3300.44s]  and it goes, Oh, red light, green light. No, you have to like stop when the person says red light.
[3300.44s -> 3309.24s]  No, you have to listen. And then you put your thumb up. You have to match it.
[3310.20s -> 3315.16s]  I win. Okay. So I'm pretty good. Okay. Fine. You think you're so fucking hot. Here we go.
[3315.64s -> 3317.08s]  Okay.
[3339.43s -> 3340.07s]  It's getting harder.
[3342.89s -> 3344.28s]  It's getting harder.
[3346.78s -> 3347.58s]  Not bad. You got it.
[3353.66s -> 3355.58s]  Hmm. Somebody's a little smarter than I thought.
[3368.44s -> 3377.58s]  All right. Close. That was it. Let's go. I win. I messed him up. I win. No, you ripped the
[3377.58s -> 3383.10s]  batteries out of the machine. That doesn't count. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. He's broken. It's broken.
[3384.86s -> 3388.54s]  What's going on? I think it's broken. I told you, you broke it. You pulled the batteries.
[3388.54s -> 3398.58s]  You can't pull the batteries out. Where'd you go? Do you just have like a notepad full of like
[3398.58s -> 3405.54s]  time fillers that you can do in any game? Like just in case something goes awry. I got it.
[3405.54s -> 3418.04s]  I got to fill some time here. Yeah. Yeah. You're very good at it. I'll give you that. Okay.
[3418.76s -> 3422.44s]  What one's nighttime? Is it 6 PM guys? Is that when mom calls you in for dinner? I don't know.
[3422.44s -> 3427.03s]  That's not on my notepad. I only know what's written down on my second monitor. Okay. Well,
[3427.03s -> 3432.49s]  what's next on the script? Wouldn't you like to know? Magician never gives away his script.
[3437.51s -> 3448.49s]  Okay. Ma says we can stay out till 7 30. It's a five of 43 PM right now. You mean secrets.
[3448.49s -> 3464.36s]  That is that's a script. I'm going to just walk somebody here. What are we doing?
[3465.08s -> 3471.80s]  We're waiting for nighttime. It's almost nighttime. Is that another hour? Time goes by fast. But not a
[3471.80s -> 3479.10s]  real hour. There's a there's items to like switch it tonight, but I can't remember. What are your
[3479.10s -> 3489.96s]  computer specs? I don't know. I got a Dell. I have a gateway PC. You know, those like $245
[3492.20s -> 3498.68s]  cow machines. They didn't even come with a fucking CPU. I don't know what's up with our health. I
[3498.68s -> 3518.52s]  don't know why I have 540. I don't know what happened. It is now 7 PM. That's nighttime,
[3518.52s -> 3532.10s]  right? We need it to be 7 PM. TTS. When is sundown? Star. Sundown is at 7. Hey, how could you even get
[3532.10s -> 3538.23s]  in on the wow classic thing? You have like five seconds to answer before like an end game.
[3538.79s -> 3546.54s]  Okay. So I, okay. I already did it. Here's your answer. That's a really good answer. I'm glad that.
[3549.74s -> 3561.26s]  All right. Here we go. Oh my God. All right. Pay attention to this.
[3561.26s -> 3565.34s]  You're gonna have to do this back to me. It's Simon. You're gonna have to do it back to me.
[3565.34s -> 3578.33s]  Okay. Okay. Just do something. I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I'll try.
[3584.17s -> 3594.90s]  Was that good? Oh, I dropped 32 gold. I'm sorry. 32 gold is not a lot. It's a lot.
[3602.41s -> 3609.70s]  Well, that is not good against enemies that move quickly. Oh, these aren't moving fast.
[3610.74s -> 3621.14s]  Surely you're getting eaten alive down there. I know. I can't do it. I'm like, I'm just like,
[3621.14s -> 3627.75s]  who? I may as well just be walking into the towers. I'm surprised you're not writing in chat right
[3627.75s -> 3640.90s]  now. Oh, dude, I almost got my adrenaline meter. I've almost got revensions. I'm going to stay in
[3640.90s -> 3663.77s]  here. What are you doing over here? He's being useless. Ooh, that was a pretty good setup there.
[3673.45s -> 3679.03s]  I'm probably shouldn't, maybe I shouldn't go in the air. I'm like, they hit faster than me.
[3683.66s -> 3690.54s]  UFO has a little flow in some spots, but this is also, I think you and Ashley, I want to build
[3690.54s -> 3697.82s]  the thing just to show you the stupid circle mine cart that confuses every boss.
[3700.54s -> 3711.02s]  Get out of the fucking baby trolley. All right. Oh God.
[3719.45s -> 3723.05s]  This is the expert level. And you know, there's a YouTube video of a guy doing this
[3723.61s -> 3729.61s]  and his hands are just like around the whole Simon. Can they chase you for a second so I
[3729.61s -> 3750.10s]  can switch my arrows? Sure. I'll go like this. Thank you. I am very pleased. I'm very happy to be
[3750.74s -> 3757.93s]  the rock that you threw to distract the enemy. I don't know what you did, but it worked for a
[3757.93s -> 3764.92s]  second. I didn't think it would be possible. It's like a ghost in here. What is even fucking in here?
[3764.92s -> 3774.02s]  Stop, leave me alone. Get it again. I spawned, they spawned in here.
[3778.94s -> 3786.50s]  What was that? So that was like a car accident. Is it safe to come back? Don't worry,
[3786.50s -> 3794.97s]  Jerma. It's not much longer. There we go. There we go. There we go.
[3795.61s -> 3806.44s]  I love your one little Pokemon still blowing wind down there.
[3808.12s -> 3815.11s]  I just get hit and die. I can't avoid damage. I just get hit three times and explode.
[3821.00s -> 3827.99s]  This is really my fault. In the past, for like most other streams, I would have prepared you for
[3827.99s -> 3833.88s]  this. But it's like the finish line is right there and my little brother just tripped and it's like
[3833.88s -> 3841.91s]  I'm looking back, but I'm still running forward. Yeah. And I'm really hurt too. No, brother,
[3841.91s -> 3848.23s]  little brother, give me that back. Not only did I fall down, I got very seriously injured.
[3849.77s -> 3855.21s]  There's another phase. I don't think it happens. My leg is going the other way and you're all just
[3855.21s -> 3876.07s]  like, ah, okay. No, but seriously drop those. All of it? Yeah. This is a stick up. And then,
[3876.63s -> 3884.30s]  okay. I'll give you what you need. We're at the finish line and I just saw you trip,
[3884.30s -> 3887.42s]  but I don't care and I didn't prepare you. Hey, hey, hey, come here, come here, come here.
[3888.22s -> 3892.30s]  Didn't that- You're taking one of these. Didn't that happen like three streams ago, by the way?
[3892.30s -> 3898.70s]  I think I've had a broken leg just sitting there since like we fought the fucking plant boss.
[3900.54s -> 3907.90s]  A broken leg? Yeah. You know, I'm bringing up your like running the race joke. No, I agree.
[3907.90s -> 3914.31s]  This happened like two streams ago. We hit plantera and I was just like, okay. Like I have a-
[3915.35s -> 3918.79s]  Oh, fuck. I pressed B for backpack and I'd B for drink all potions.
[3919.59s -> 3921.43s]  Yeah. You did just drink all your potions.
[3923.83s -> 3930.71s]  Oh, my leg. Big butter. Big bit of my leg. You're going to have to pick me up.
[3931.69s -> 3936.57s]  And that's, that's for you too. What the fuck is this? This is like the best item I've ever seen.
[3937.53s -> 3945.03s]  Yeah. What is this stuff? It's like I said, that's supposed to be the final boss of thorium
[3945.99s -> 3952.41s]  and it's not that hard and it just keeps- It's like, here's the end of the game. Here,
[3952.41s -> 3957.05s]  have some goofy end game items that you can craft immediately. And-
[3957.85s -> 3962.65s]  What? I can have like 10 of these? Yeah. Now you turn into like a superhero.
[3963.69s -> 3973.50s]  Where are the armor? No. Okay. Where are the armor? I'm- I know.
[3975.32s -> 3980.12s]  I- I- It also makes you bind a special key that I don't think you have bound or you'll
[3980.12s -> 3988.31s]  have to check in the options if you have it. Molten banner. I'm holding this banner. What the
[3988.31s -> 3996.17s]  fuck? 25%. What do I get for this? Set bonus. Pressing the special ability key will unleash
[3996.17s -> 4003.03s]  an echo of slag fury's power. It's like a bonus stationary summon that shoots a million missiles.
[4003.83s -> 4026.31s]  Do I even have special bound? Keybinds. Special ability. Where is special ability?
[4027.35s -> 4034.47s]  Uh, it would be under thorium. Oh, it's like a mod. Yes. Uh, controls all the way down at the
[4034.47s -> 4042.31s]  bottom. Thorium special ability. Thorium special ability. Um, like, I'm gonna, I guess, just,
[4042.31s -> 4051.96s]  I'm just, jeez, is that okay? How long- What's the cooldown on this? Uh, it's like a minute.
[4051.96s -> 4055.40s]  I don't know. I don't know exactly. I just pressed it. It didn't do anything. It just like
[4055.48s -> 4060.92s]  looked like- No, that thing right there is- Oh. Well, there's nothing, there's no enemy,
[4060.92s -> 4069.51s]  so it's not shooting. Oh, I see. Cool. All right. Nice. Well, now we can just like sneeze on moon
[4069.51s -> 4077.35s]  lord. You want to just sneeze and kill moon lord? Yeah. Ooh, let's go get it. Right. Into the UFO.
[4078.23s -> 4082.23s]  Yeah, where's that guy? He's laughing at you for using astral chunks. Where's that guy now?
[4082.23s -> 4086.71s]  Yeah, where's that guy? Yeah, my big bro killed Ragnarok for me. Where'd that guy go?
[4091.75s -> 4098.87s]  What's your favorite 80s comedy movie? Ignore the pink blocks. 80s Ghostbusters.
[4100.36s -> 4106.68s]  That's not a comedy. Is it 80? Was that 88? 89? Was that 90? Might be 99. 91 maybe. You're debating
[4106.68s -> 4109.88s]  the wrong thing. It's not a comedy. Yes, it is. What are you talking about? There's not like a
[4109.88s -> 4113.72s]  single funny thing in that whole movie. Every single actor in that was a comedian. Wait,
[4113.72s -> 4122.39s]  wait, hold on. What did you just say? Quote one funny thing from Ghostbusters. What the hell are
[4122.39s -> 4139.10s]  you doing? Okay, I just did that. Anyone laugh? Were there any lulls in your chat? That's an actual
[4139.10s -> 4145.00s]  quote from that movie and it's a really funny part of the movie. Those who get it will know.
[4145.00s -> 4157.69s]  Are we talking the one where the Ghostbusters were all women or like classic? Dan Aykroyd,
[4157.69s -> 4166.18s]  Bill Murray. That died instantly. Yeah, we have really good items now.
[4166.82s -> 4177.18s]  Am I not using this? Somebody said use the fire staff. Isn't that the fire staff?
[4177.82s -> 4184.28s]  Superior ancient spark? Oh, there was a different like magic attack I could have gotten you. I don't
[4184.28s -> 4192.20s]  think I crafted one. Use the molten banner while holding this banner. Wait, that's not like a
[4192.20s -> 4199.69s]  Diablo 2 charm. I have to actually hold it out. Watch out, dude. Moon Lord's coming.
[4199.69s -> 4202.57s]  Is Moon Lord coming? This is going to be the hardest fight because this is like
[4202.57s -> 4216.25s]  end game content. This is Deathwing. That's end game content. Okay, I'm ready. Does he go...
[4220.33s -> 4223.51s]  Holy shit, that's actually way crazier than I thought it was going to be.
[4224.07s -> 4247.18s]  He's got me. Is he dead? I think so. Oh no, no, he's half. Now you're going to shoot his heart.
[4247.98s -> 4257.86s]  Go for the hot. I can't get in close enough. Oh no, he's dead. That was rough. Hey,
[4257.86s -> 4263.14s]  give me the freaking Luminite. What are you doing, little bro? Congratulations. You have just beaten
[4263.14s -> 4275.29s]  the base game of Terraria. See you guys later. That's it. What do you want? Luminite or Luminite.
[4275.85s -> 4283.69s]  Do you want one of my huge... Never mind. Luminite or Celestial Onion. What does it look like?
[4283.69s -> 4291.93s]  Shadow Diamond. Yeah, I'm going to give you a hundred beats. Where is it? Luminite or...
[4292.57s -> 4302.94s]  What does it look like? Is it portal gum? It's ore, so it looks like a little blob.
[4303.74s -> 4313.64s]  Yeah, there's a portal gum. I don't think I have any of this shit. Oh, Luminite. You keep
[4313.64s -> 4318.04s]  little brothering and picking it all up. This doesn't look like ore. This looks like trash.
[4320.25s -> 4324.89s]  Oh, thank you. Thank you for giving me the trash. Okay, so what's going to happen now, I guess,
[4324.89s -> 4329.77s]  is you can tell funny stories and I'm going to speed run the post-Moon Lord content.
[4330.89s -> 4341.83s]  What? This is cool. Quick, do the thing. Hold on, I got to do the thing. I got to do the thing.
[4342.63s -> 4367.16s]  Wait. No, hold on. Oh, shit. Is he doing something funny?
[4368.86s -> 4373.10s]  Yeah, I'm doing the thing that you do with the portal gun in the first 40 minutes of portal.
[4373.10s -> 4377.93s]  You figure out you can do that. All right, so you want to speed run the rest of the game?
[4378.65s -> 4380.81s]  Yeah, I'm like, I'm just, I'm not going to clue you in.
[4381.85s -> 4391.45s]  Well, I'm just going to teleport to you. I'm just going to buy wormhole potions and then teleport
[4391.45s -> 4410.25s]  to you. Oh, there's the, there's the original music. It's been a journey. Why are there snowmen with
[4410.25s -> 4418.73s]  guns up here? Snowmen, gangsters? It was in my inventory, so I had to get rid of it.
[4418.73s -> 4431.21s]  Oh, they're dead. Oh, did I? Oh, that's awesome. That's such a cool enemy. Okay, I'm going to buy
[4431.21s -> 4438.54s]  some, I'm going to buy some pots and then I'm coming to you. Did they sell wormhole potions
[4438.54s -> 4443.83s]  or do I just have to make them? Right. Do we have any? Well, you can buy them from Lucy,
[4443.83s -> 4453.62s]  but you have to send it to store one. So when you talk to her, she says, which shop?
[4454.26s -> 4457.85s]  You need it to be classic, like wild classic, you know what I'm saying?
[4463.62s -> 4469.62s]  Okay, that's weird, I guess. Strangely enough, I don't know what you mean by that. Reeses.
[4470.98s -> 4479.14s]  All right. How do you eat it? Who cares? You sound like someone, but who do you sound like?
[4479.78s -> 4488.47s]  Who was that? I should know that was Will Arnett, the Reese's commercial. I thought you guys would
[4488.47s -> 4500.82s]  have known what that was. I would make, I would make quasars flair. It's very good. But I gave my
[4500.82s -> 4506.02s]  Daedalus Stormbow to my other character. Where the fuck is this wormhole potion? Because I didn't
[4506.02s -> 4512.62s]  play for three weeks. I don't have one right now. $50 just came in right now. $50. Thanks for the
[4512.62s -> 4519.98s]  $50 AV Joe. And this is for Star. Hey, please tell, uh, hey Sturm, tell, please tell Jar that he's
[4519.98s -> 4523.02s]  doing a good job. Glad to see you playing one of my favorite games. Will you be playing it again
[4523.02s -> 4530.98s]  when they release mini golf? Is that real? Uh, I will. I don't know if I'll stream it, but I'll
[4530.98s -> 4536.95s]  probably play that. Oh yeah. Yeah. Now the answer for me is no. Make sure you catch Star Stream.
[4537.98s -> 4547.45s]  Are you said to? All right. Hold on. Shop changer. You said vanilla, right? Yeah.
[4548.73s -> 4558.54s]  On Lucy. And what color is the wormhole potion? Um, blue water walking feather fall. Why is there
[4558.86s -> 4585.32s]  like a triceratops in here? I'm looking for triceratops. Uh, is that me? I don't know what
[4585.32s -> 4601.13s]  that was. Okay. Invisibility, gills, flipper, hunter. I have no idea what that is. It sounds
[4601.13s -> 4610.95s]  like I live. I'll be right back. Is that thunder? It sounds like an airplane in my house. Yeah. Go
[4610.95s -> 4624.66s]  take a BRB. See what's going on. That sounded like there was like thunder. I don't think it's on
[4624.66s -> 4640.97s]  here. Yeah. I think it's, uh, AC one 30 inbound. Uh, excuse me. Yeah. You've got a UAV. All right.
[4640.97s -> 4647.37s]  This is way more important. Where is this potion? Oh my God. Am I going to have to like, it's not
[4647.37s -> 4654.06s]  on, it's not on vanilla wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, worm, worm, worm,
[4654.54s -> 4663.22s]  worm. Oh, you're right. Um, do you see in the underneath way at the bottom, bottom left,
[4663.22s -> 4686.36s]  the like bottom, bottom NPC Severus, the alchemist he has. Okay. All the way down there. You have to
[4686.36s -> 4693.58s]  make a full metal alchemist reference. I'm not sure. No, I was going to just that was funny for
[4693.58s -> 4698.63s]  20 episodes. I was going to scream out, but then I don't think I could do it. I could
[4699.75s -> 4717.02s]  What was this guy's name? Severus found an alchemist. Hey, there they are. Good here.
[4717.74s -> 4726.68s]  You can have this. All right. I'm ready. I'm not sure.
[4732.86s -> 4737.46s]  Very good. I'm hiring you. That was the test one.
[4746.38s -> 4751.58s]  That was an elbow chop. All right. So I'm ready. Let's go.
[4753.72s -> 4760.07s]  I'm going to be able to do this one more time. Deposit all. Yeah. Nice. All right. So what's the
[4760.07s -> 4769.91s]  next thing we're going to do? I teleport to you. Well, I bought 10 of these. So, oh, you must be
[4769.91s -> 4776.87s]  rich. You know, for 10 of those is at least five platinum in there, man. No, I didn't get rid of
[4776.87s -> 4784.95s]  this stupid thing. This thing's causing me an issue. Is it having an issue right now? That's
[4784.95s -> 4792.23s]  better. Now I can do one, two, three, four, five. I can do five of those. Damn. What was I doing?
[4795.78s -> 4809.53s]  I need to make the unholy shard. What am I doing? Can I turn this into anything? This staff?
[4810.68s -> 4819.48s]  No, this is the ultimate ability. And do something with this? No. So is there any
[4819.48s -> 4826.74s]  reason at all to even have a pickaxe at this point? Do we need any? I made the really good
[4826.74s -> 4829.86s]  one that we need because there's new or that one, but I'm not making you one.
[4832.95s -> 4836.73s]  Don't worry about it. Do I have to activate this or can I just hold it?
[4837.98s -> 4845.78s]  Hold what? The big ice cream. You have to hold it. It's very clearly states while held. Yeah,
[4845.78s -> 4853.32s]  but I don't know. You don't know what? When I click, it goes, you don't know what? When I click,
[4853.32s -> 4860.02s]  it goes, I didn't know if I had to turn it on or something. I don't know. Is there any reason for
[4860.02s -> 4866.04s]  at all to have German stars for area speedrun? I don't know. Is there any reason at all for you
[4866.04s -> 4869.80s]  to go on like a road trip with your friends or are you just going to go on that road trip by yourself?
[4877.59s -> 4884.89s]  Exactly. When you click on an enemy with a banner, it makes your minions target an enemy.
[4884.89s -> 4890.65s]  Okay. So there is a point to click. I mean, I didn't know. What am I supposed to know everything?
[4890.65s -> 4894.01s]  I don't know. You have, you're the one with like 200 days played in this game.
[4894.89s -> 4902.71s]  I didn't, I didn't make a summoner ever. What am I supposed to know these things?
[4903.43s -> 4911.74s]  What the fuck was that? That was maybe a real funny guy. So what's the next boss?
[4912.30s -> 4918.36s]  Profane guardians. And then we got to kill the profane goddess and we have to kill, um,
[4921.61s -> 4926.09s]  uh, the marshmallow man. If I see your sound is muted one more time in this chat, I will,
[4926.09s -> 4935.86s]  I'm going to swallow a whole egg. Me? No, mine. What? Oh, what am I doing?
[4939.16s -> 4941.56s]  Where's the thing I'm looking for? Tell me where it is.
[4941.88s -> 4957.19s]  Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, celestial hill bomber.
[4967.94s -> 4972.90s]  Didn't I make the fricking onk on this character? I did. Right?
[4972.90s -> 4976.90s]  Before we played the game, you did mention I have too many characters. I don't know who is who.
[4977.54s -> 4985.74s]  You did say I don't, but I swear I like farmed and made an onk the last time we stopped playing
[4985.74s -> 4993.16s]  and I know, and I just like, don't have it or is, or is this it? I don't know. No.
[4995.30s -> 5001.91s]  Why does the music keep getting funky? Oh, because of the mushroom biome that I made above us.
[5002.79s -> 5011.77s]  That's onk town wings. I don't feel like making all this stuff. Like I could,
[5011.77s -> 5015.37s]  but I've already done this with, I'm just going to, I'm going to go fight things.
[5015.85s -> 5021.59s]  So you're going to go fight, we're going, where are you going? To the teleporter?
[5023.24s -> 5034.76s]  Oh, he's during the daytime, dude. My God. Like now, now. Hey, I keep forgetting to sleep in the
[5034.76s -> 5043.94s]  bed. This is awful. I really am just a little kid in the car. I just have an ice cream in the car.
[5045.53s -> 5050.31s]  Don't get it on the seat. I'm getting ready to fight a boss. We got to fight it during the day.
[5050.31s -> 5053.03s]  So I'm going to craft the thing that lets me skip the time of day, but I don't remember what I need
[5053.03s -> 5058.95s]  to craft that thing. Let's go. Let's go. I'm assuming, I'm assuming souls of a night.
[5060.15s -> 5068.94s]  So let me ask you something. We, this is, we've done a, we've beaten Terraria, the base game.
[5068.94s -> 5076.14s]  No, yes. What has been your favorite moment from the Star and Jeremy Terraria playthrough?
[5076.14s -> 5081.34s]  I told you. What was it? It was when you said, isn't this cheating when we were making platforms
[5081.34s -> 5088.46s]  to fight a boss? That's easily my number one takeaway and favorite moment. Cool.
[5090.78s -> 5097.66s]  My favorite was learning how to alt click items to not deposit them after 16 hours.
[5098.86s -> 5110.60s]  Cool. Mine would be when like for some weird reason, you knew the recipe for the like day
[5110.60s -> 5116.82s]  changing item and you told me like how to do it. I did? No, like, no, like right now, if you told
[5116.82s -> 5120.50s]  me how to do it, that would be my favorite part. How do I do it guys? How do I do it? How do I do
[5120.50s -> 5122.74s]  it? How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it?
[5122.74s -> 5129.06s]  I'm muted. How do I do it? I'm looking at chat. Someone says it's called Cosmo light. Like how
[5129.06s -> 5135.62s]  the hell does that help? If it was me, I would say I'm going to take a guess here. It's a hell stones
[5135.62s -> 5145.30s]  and light souls. I don't know. That makes sense. I'm looking to be held by the hand here. I do
[5145.30s -> 5150.42s]  have to make moonlight and then I have to make daylight. Moonlight and sunlight, right? Three
[5150.42s -> 5155.06s]  sun stones and 22 of the fire spirits from the moon lord. I'm just taking a guess here.
[5156.50s -> 5176.25s]  You're wrong. You're wrong. You guys are supposed to get my back here. You're supposed to have my
[5176.25s -> 5202.95s]  back. 720 damage. Get you baited. So where are you off to now? I feel like the last like 12 minutes
[5202.95s -> 5209.03s]  of this playthrough has been star remembers how to summon things. There's a lot of things
[5209.03s -> 5214.15s]  to summon. You're going to fight a boss? Yeah. What the fuck have you not told me this for?
[5215.43s -> 5236.97s]  Alright, let's go. Holy shit. This is fun. I like being able to destroy things and then they drop
[5236.97s -> 5242.22s]  the profane core which I don't think you can make this like non consumable but I don't think we need
[5242.22s -> 5248.65s]  to do. Pretty sure it will be the first time. I'm feeling pretty good about that. So are we fighting
[5248.65s -> 5253.37s]  here? Yeah, we're going to fight here. The things that we just fought are adds for the next boss.
[5253.37s -> 5272.26s]  Oh jeez. Okay. It's a pretty rough one. Alright, I'm ready. He's fast. He's fast.
[5283.35s -> 5288.70s]  He's like flying around in the dirt and I can't shoot him because they're up that high.
[5289.66s -> 5292.81s]  What are you doing?
[5300.90s -> 5332.41s]  What happened? My little brother shot up and just made it harder. God damn it. I'm just
[5332.41s -> 5355.99s]  I don't know where I am. I've lost a dinghy world. Help. Watch you win.
[5360.98s -> 5364.66s]  I'm just like I die. So I just I spawn. Hey, I'm going to spawn to you.
[5364.66s -> 5373.75s]  How was it? Did you do anything fun? He's dead. Nice. Good job. Thank you.
[5374.71s -> 5380.89s]  That was a tough one, huh? That was a tough one. Now, what do we do? When you show up and like take
[5380.89s -> 5390.41s]  all of the items again, which is my favorite part and then and what happens next, you know, go on.
[5391.86s -> 5395.46s]  I'd like tell you to give it to me. He's going to do it.
[5395.86s -> 5403.46s]  Uh huh. I don't even remember what he dropped. I just remember it. It's it's important and you're
[5403.46s -> 5407.30s]  just going to like auto stash it and I'm not going to remember what it was. No, I'm going to throw
[5407.30s -> 5423.90s]  it to you right now. Oh, this one has summoned damage. Summoned it. Nice. Oh, poop. You're
[5423.90s -> 5429.35s]  supposed to fight him in the other area to get the other. There are two items up here. Oh,
[5429.35s -> 5438.18s]  shit. Then you get the rune of cost. Look at this. But some say cost them. Get those. I'll wait for
[5438.18s -> 5449.58s]  you to get it. Divine Geode. OK, I got a divine unholy essence and a divine. I keep forgetting
[5449.58s -> 5457.77s]  to sleep in the bed. And you make fun of me for making mistakes. Yeah, well, that's because you
[5457.77s -> 5466.36s]  are more. So is this any good? This Divine Geo. What can I do with this? Let me talk to the guy.
[5466.36s -> 5472.95s]  Uh, I think you can chop it up. Yeah. I don't remember. What did you just say?
[5473.83s -> 5481.78s]  I didn't say nothing. Hey, defense absorbs 25% damage on players on your team. Only active above
[5481.78s -> 5491.80s]  25% life. OK, so it's like you can make armor. 10% increased damage. Any summoning stuff?
[5496.38s -> 5500.01s]  What? I'm just thinking if there's anything for summoners here with this Geode.
[5500.73s -> 5508.06s]  Unholy Essence. Let's see if I can do that. Profaned Crucible. Oh, we never fought the
[5508.06s -> 5512.06s]  Ravager. And now he's buffed because we killed that boss. We had to do the Ravager.
[5512.70s -> 5523.24s]  How come you didn't remind me? I don't I don't know what that is. Did you did you get this stupid
[5523.24s -> 5532.82s]  snowman staff? Are you snowman? Hail bomber summons kamikaze snowmen that will blow up upon
[5532.82s -> 5539.72s]  hitting enemies. I mean, that sounds like I did. All right, I'll try it. Is it a sentry? Does it
[5539.72s -> 5550.60s]  replace my cool thing? No, I think I think they're just spells. What? Yeah, they have like a
[5550.60s -> 5559.69s]  duration. Oh, OK. That's kind of cool. All right. Where are you off to now? Going to the dungeon.
[5560.81s -> 5576.10s]  Going to the dungeon. Why are you going down here? There's a there's a boss down here. There's a lot
[5576.10s -> 5585.88s]  of new stuff in the dungeon. There's two bosses down here, actually. Are you snowman? I'm not
[5585.88s -> 5594.62s]  snowman. Never dig straight down. I didn't know that. What? You don't take fall damage
[5595.34s -> 5611.08s]  because of lava. Oh, I wouldn't see it. You are going so fast. Holy shit. Cool.
[5611.88s -> 5633.22s]  Oh, wow. Why are you going that way? I'm clearing space for in case one of the bosses show up.
[5633.22s -> 5645.22s]  Oh, hey, German. I need you to just stay here. Stay here. Yeah, I'll be right back for real.
[5654.68s -> 5668.54s]  He's never coming back. Is he? Well, how is that not working? OK, I guess this item is dumb.
[5673.86s -> 5690.86s]  Now I'm going to go. I'm now fully protected. Fuck. Just kill. OK, are you dying?
[5692.10s -> 5699.34s]  No, I just got almost insta killed. Why is this guy so bad? The guy playing, not the character.
[5699.34s -> 5705.03s]  That's what I mean. All right. I just almost died instantly by like a fireball. Should that be
[5705.03s -> 5736.76s]  happening? Oh, I mean, this this area is a little bit buff, but no. How is it? Yes. I mean, see,
[5736.76s -> 5744.39s]  that's understandable. There's a lot of things going on. I just get hit twice and die. That's
[5744.39s -> 5756.30s]  what I've been doing for the last like hour and a half. Oh, I died. Shit. That was a that was a big
[5756.30s -> 5760.78s]  oof. You know what they say? That was a big oof. That's what they say. You know what I'm saying?
[5760.78s -> 5773.08s]  They talk about it. Stop it. Where are you going to the dungeon? I got to pick up all the things.
[5773.64s -> 5789.02s]  Wait, how did you go fast? Shit, you're like, oh, I'm just teleporting to you at this point.
[5789.02s -> 5796.54s]  Why would I wait? I'm going to get down there. I'm going to get down there when I get here. Finally.
[5797.50s -> 5805.51s]  Hey, don't matter how you eat it. It's okay. Okay. Um,
[5809.88s -> 5823.93s]  this is scrumptious. What are you up to? No, I don't know. I did. I picked up. Look at all this crap.
[5824.73s -> 5832.23s]  I don't even want this stuff. They won't leave me. I don't want it. There's a boss that summons
[5832.23s -> 5836.95s]  here, but you have to get like 50 ectoplasms first. 50 ectoplasms. That sounds like a lot of
[5836.95s -> 5842.71s]  ectoplasms. Like pink skulls that fly at you. I think appear after you kill enemies sometimes.
[5843.99s -> 5847.27s]  And then it's kind of a tough boss and it might kill me, but I kind of want to fight it.
[5847.75s -> 5853.40s]  Either that or I can. Oh, hey, you got the portal gun? No, you don't have the portal gun.
[5853.40s -> 5861.96s]  I deposited that what seems like a decade ago. Um, go home right now, little bro, because
[5862.68s -> 5866.52s]  I need you to get that portal gun for me. Okay, I'm going to get the portal gun.
[5866.52s -> 5877.27s]  Make sure you heal up, you know, buy your buff potions. Okay. Okay. What did you need? You need
[5877.27s -> 5880.87s]  the portal gun. Anything else while I'm here? I need the portal gun while you're there, bro.
[5884.92s -> 5892.44s]  Some people consider using it during a boss fight cheating. Do you? I don't. Why is it? I don't
[5892.44s -> 5904.34s]  understand what you mean. How would that be cheating? You know, forget it. Did I already use all my
[5904.34s -> 5916.46s]  fucking potions? Well, I'm sorry. I'm coming. Hold on. Let me. I need more potions. Let's get some
[5917.50s -> 5930.60s]  magic power. I want some more of these. Okay, that's fine. I want to get. I think I'll put the four.
[5932.12s -> 5944.94s]  Whatever. All right. Yeah, I got what you need. Okay. Come give it to me. Portal gun incoming.
[5946.94s -> 5956.54s]  Thanks, bro. Here you go. Oh, okay. I was going to entrust the portal gun to you.
[5957.91s -> 5971.08s]  No, don't trust me. The damn thing. Okay. Now we find a boss right now. Uh, not yet.
[5981.21s -> 5986.17s]  Okay. So you, you go, you go on this side, come out that side. Okay. We might need to make this
[5986.17s -> 5991.77s]  wider. You can't go in the portal if you're on your UFO. Right. But what's that? What is it? What
[5991.77s -> 5996.57s]  are we doing this for? Why do we have a portal? Because we're going to fight a boss and it's
[5996.57s -> 6005.29s]  undodgeable. Undodgeable. It really helps to have. So what you mean just like go in portal and you
[6005.29s -> 6009.85s]  end up over here and then do it again. Just run around a circle. Uh, yeah. Like once it comes
[6009.85s -> 6013.29s]  towards you, you go in the portal and then when it comes back towards you again, you go to the
[6013.29s -> 6019.69s]  portal again. Uh, it's not foolproof. You're, you're going to die, but it'll help. What if I just stand
[6019.69s -> 6035.00s]  protected in a manmade house? No. What do you mean? No. I mean, they all go to the walls. Uh,
[6036.76s -> 6043.38s]  fantoplasm. No warning. Okay. A like three, two, one would have been slightly helpful.
[6064.41s -> 6081.58s]  You know, 2020 hindsight, you should have made it be the guy that has 50,000 HP. Not the guy that
[6081.58s -> 6086.70s]  died. It would be really easy to switch to it if you want to. The, um, the armor that we got after
[6086.70s -> 6095.42s]  killing Ragnaros, not Ragnarok. Uh, it gives you an armor set for melee and the special ability
[6095.42s -> 6101.78s]  button makes you immune for like a couple of seconds. And it also like gives you shields as
[6101.78s -> 6111.30s]  you attack. Uh, and also you should have made me blah, blah, blah. Like I didn't make you anything.
[6112.18s -> 6118.30s]  You said summoner, you should do it. It's so much fun. And you, you entice me with like fun,
[6118.30s -> 6126.87s]  cool little pets. Well, little bro, if you want the melee set, I can make that for you and get you
[6126.87s -> 6130.47s]  the life steal item so that you can just swing at things and press the immune button when you feel
[6130.47s -> 6136.06s]  scared. Just kidding. It's fine. I'm fine. You sure? That's very good. There's no shame. No,
[6136.06s -> 6156.84s]  no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. He said no. I lasted a lot longer that time during a blink
[6156.84s -> 6170.36s]  twice. Are you actually having fun? I think Terraria is a good game. Does illuminate? No,
[6170.36s -> 6177.74s]  illuminate is irrelevant. That was blinked twice. So having fun. So Yolo bloom. And I
[6177.74s -> 6198.98s]  forget the other one now. Um, I was rocking on chair. I want to get the other boss to someone.
[6200.10s -> 6214.50s]  I just got to kill things. Just kill stuff. Get down there. Get down there and attack that.
[6217.21s -> 6220.09s]  You guys are stupid, but when you get down and you finally do something,
[6220.89s -> 6241.35s]  imagine being called stupid and it's stupid. Why are you digging? Why can't you just go down?
[6243.93s -> 6251.56s]  Why are you doing that? I really like the sound digging mix in Terraria and you got to make
[6251.56s -> 6255.16s]  things like, like once you can dig this fast, you got to make things like symmetrical and even.
[6256.12s -> 6270.86s]  I just realized you're doing like 700 damage every quarter second. Yeah. No problem, bro.
[6271.42s -> 6283.56s]  Yeah, kind of. There's no water candles here. That's what's going on. There's no water cannons.
[6285.40s -> 6293.66s]  Also, I'm getting spikes off the walls. Stop touching. You do that per fireball per quarter
[6293.66s -> 6301.70s]  per second. You can equip the DPS meter and see what your DPS is. Let's compare it on the next
[6301.70s -> 6307.30s]  boss. Do you have one? You should have it showing up on the right hand side because I have one.
[6307.30s -> 6309.78s]  Yeah. What do you got? Well, you can also make
[6311.54s -> 6317.13s]  target dummies so you can shoot the target dummy. Let's find out. Read this. All right.
[6318.57s -> 6345.11s]  Looks like you're sticking around. Oh, no. The little ghosts can kill me. I am just such a little
[6345.11s -> 6353.75s]  shit wanker. What are you looking for exactly? Dungeon enemies. I think we got rid of all the
[6353.75s -> 6361.67s]  water candles though. Unless I use another zerg potion. Hey, bro. Hey, bro. Yes. Go back up to
[6361.67s -> 6366.31s]  the room we cleared out and I'll be right back. Go back up to the room we cleared out. Yeah. That
[6366.31s -> 6371.35s]  big square room where I was digging a lot, you know, where there's like not a room. The big square
[6371.35s -> 6384.65s]  room. Okay. Got it. There's an alien here. What are you doing? Attack this. Kill this thing.
[6385.13s -> 6395.70s]  Attack it. Oh, it's not real. An illusion. Okay. I'm back. You're not even back up at the room yet.
[6395.70s -> 6407.32s]  I thought I had an issue. All right. Come on, little bro. The thing is, the funny thing about
[6407.32s -> 6417.56s]  this is people don't even know. I'm like older than you. He doesn't know, Pepe. Die. He doesn't
[6417.56s -> 6432.04s]  know. Okay, don't die. What? What the fuck? You can't just do this to me. I said don't die.
[6433.00s -> 6448.79s]  Oh, that's some slow down. Okay, here it comes. Not plantara. Hey, but there's no,
[6450.09s -> 6467.32s]  no potions available. I can't believe this boss is not plantara. Okay, what's your GPS? I'm dead.
[6468.58s -> 6487.54s]  Oh, oh, you're still shooting at it. Why do I die so fast? I don't know. Star, why do I die in two
[6487.54s -> 6493.46s]  hits? Because the summoner armorers throughout the entire game provide the least amount of armor.
[6495.45s -> 6501.05s]  So you're taking more damage than any other class. Oh, and also you're just getting hit a lot.
[6502.07s -> 6505.99s]  It's a combination of those two things. How many times do you, how many times do you have to hit
[6505.99s -> 6522.94s]  before you die? You? I don't think I can. You can't die? Yeah. It's almost, it's like impossible
[6522.94s -> 6527.02s]  to avoid damage in this game though, because shit is just on every pixel of your screen.
[6527.98s -> 6540.38s]  Oh, that's not true. Not true. You literally can't die if you just go melee. You really should.
[6541.10s -> 6552.36s]  All right, I'm going melee. Let's go. I'll come back and buy this shit for you. I think I still
[6552.36s -> 6560.76s]  have it in my inventory. Melee is so boring though. Yeah, but I've been playing this the whole time.
[6562.89s -> 6574.33s]  And if I really am just going to go like, oh, dead. I'd like to play the game. Okay. You're
[6574.33s -> 6583.50s]  ready for me to hand things to you? Nope. Not yet. Uh-huh. No. Now I am. Take that. Wait,
[6583.50s -> 6592.63s]  was that the right one? What should it be? Yeah, that's the right one. Take that. Nice. Nice.
[6594.07s -> 6602.14s]  Take that. Nice. Take that. Ooh. Uh, and I'll go get you the, um, the, uh,
[6602.14s -> 6610.04s]  I don't care anymore life steal item. Hey, thanks for boosting me to 60.
[6611.40s -> 6616.42s]  No problem. Yeah. How come everyone in wild classic right now is like, oh, first to 60,
[6616.42s -> 6620.90s]  dude, just wait, wait until they add the buy a S level 60 account option.
[6620.90s -> 6625.30s]  Do you know what I used to do? And now I am, I'm, I'm, I'm not ashamed. I'll tell,
[6625.30s -> 6630.10s]  who cares? That was, this was years ago. I used to, this is back before you could
[6631.22s -> 6638.18s]  purchase any of that shit. I used to have like the three characters, right? Yeah. So I'd have
[6638.18s -> 6644.02s]  three or four characters, like accounts, and I would multi box those accounts. And what I would
[6644.02s -> 6649.86s]  do is I would bring like level tens into the front door of a dungeon that they could get into level,
[6649.86s -> 6654.50s]  like 10, 15, 20, depending on what the requirement was to get in. I would sit them at the door.
[6656.36s -> 6660.28s]  So three people in the dungeon would just be standing at the front door, going into the
[6660.28s -> 6666.20s]  instance. I would then have my main character aggro the entire instance, every single enemy.
[6666.76s -> 6672.04s]  You could not get hurt. And then I would do one move once the whole dungeon was aggroed
[6672.04s -> 6679.50s]  and they'd level up like 15 times. I think I told my chat was because I brought up
[6679.50s -> 6684.30s]  a few times the pressure. I told you, I used to multi box level accounts and sell them on
[6684.30s -> 6694.97s]  D2Legit.com in Diablo 2. It was a very short time of doing that. You'd have to like rush
[6694.97s -> 6699.93s]  like a whole multi box room full of characters to like level 80 and not use a single skill point.
[6702.62s -> 6709.88s]  We've all been there, Jerema. All right. Let me see what these things do. Very weak note.
[6709.88s -> 6719.13s]  Throws a hyper dense water malibut rains upon hit enemies. Holy shit. Okay. So the other one gives
[6719.13s -> 6723.69s]  you like bonus shields as you hit things. So you'll have bonus max health. You become
[6723.69s -> 6728.41s]  invulnerable to damage when you use your special key. You get like a bubble around you. Look at
[6728.41s -> 6736.26s]  this. This is so cool. Those all go homing as well. All right. So then and the accessory I gave you
[6736.26s -> 6742.58s]  is a is a big plus. Throws a hyper dense water malibut rains upon hit enemies. Raindrops shield
[6742.58s -> 6750.02s]  your life. Life regeneration by five produces a floating globule over five seconds. Pressing
[6750.02s -> 6754.50s]  the special ability will develop you within an impervious shield. While the bubble is active,
[6754.50s -> 6759.14s]  all damage taken is converted into healing. I feel like I'm going to need this stuff. All right. So
[6760.02s -> 6772.28s]  let's try this again. So now, did you give me an accessory too? Yeah, it's like a black glove.
[6772.28s -> 6790.20s]  Increases the damage you take by 25%. That's a lot. Yeah. All right. Let's try. It doesn't matter.
[6790.20s -> 6794.41s]  All right. Hold on. I'm going to try and make you some melee items because I think we have all the
[6794.41s -> 6799.48s]  stuff. I'm just going to do that really quick because I you still have like plus to summon
[6799.48s -> 6814.17s]  items on. Yeah. Accessories. Yes. Oh my God. I just realized I got a gift sub. Thanks a bunch.
[6814.17s -> 6821.98s]  Jerma sucks. Why am I wearing these boots and these old ass wings? I don't know. This is these
[6821.98s -> 6838.78s]  bad frozen. I never got different wings. These old ass wings. And he's right. Any wing and then
[6838.78s -> 6845.34s]  angel treads. Should we make this? We can make angel treads, but I just don't. I don't feel like
[6845.34s -> 6851.34s]  doing it. Oh, I know you don't even have. I have frozen wings. You have angel treads, right? Yeah,
[6851.34s -> 6858.44s]  you can upgrade them to serif tracers. I just do not feel like. I have frost spark boots. Oh,
[6858.44s -> 6863.00s]  and yeah, you're a step behind. Then you should like not even wear them. Also, did you use the
[6863.00s -> 6871.11s]  celestial onion? Did I use an onion? I don't. What do you mean? Do you have six accessory slots?
[6873.53s -> 6880.60s]  One. I have four and one of them is empty. Okay. You put this in the storage. Here, take this.
[6881.72s -> 6887.34s]  You put that in the storage. You use that item and it gives you an extra accessory slot
[6889.00s -> 6893.96s]  and you'd want it to store it for a better day. I'm going to hit you. You've been speed running.
[6895.16s -> 6902.52s]  It's going too fast. It's going too fast. It's going too fast. You know, to be fair, I didn't
[6902.52s -> 6908.89s]  explain to my little brother what he should be doing. That's my bad. It's, you're going too fast
[6908.89s -> 6914.97s]  for me. We, this is not just, I started playing Terraria. This is, we just got to Disneyland. I've
[6914.97s -> 6921.83s]  never been to Disneyland, right? And you are sprinting to fucking like space mountain and I
[6921.83s -> 6926.79s]  have a blindfold on. You're just like, let's go. And I'm like, I, I, wait a minute. I, oh, oh,
[6927.67s -> 6936.28s]  I want to get a corn dog. Fuck the corn dog. Get in line. I mean, that's, that's what's happening.
[6936.28s -> 6940.36s]  And then you re we get, we go on space mountain and we get up to the top of space mountain,
[6940.92s -> 6945.40s]  the big drop. And then you rip the blindfold off and go look down. And I'm like, what happened?
[6949.16s -> 6962.47s]  Yeah. That's what it's like playing Terraria. But it's really fun though. After I got off that
[6962.47s -> 6972.50s]  space mountain roller coaster, I'm just like, that was, that was really fun. So it's, I'm all right
[6972.50s -> 6977.30s]  with this. All right. So what are we doing? I mean, what do you want to do? Do you think
[6977.30s -> 6982.66s]  Jerma would play Terraria for like a hundred hours required to like learn it for the first time?
[6984.02s -> 6990.18s]  I'm, I'm, I'm doing the community a service of showing him this great game and like a bite
[6990.18s -> 6995.70s]  size, the family size pack that he can enjoy. And it's, I, it's great. See, like I, I wouldn't have
[6995.70s -> 7001.06s]  built it. I wouldn't have built like a big giant compound to have all these people. I don't even
[7001.06s -> 7005.70s]  know what have these people do. I don't even know what have these people do. I just know they're
[7005.70s -> 7013.54s]  here and it's all right. Cool. Okay. Okay. Hold on. I gotta remember how to build the ravager.
[7014.10s -> 7036.36s]  Replace the emblem, the guarding Avenger emblem, 12% increased damage to defense.
[7037.24s -> 7047.27s]  Is this sucks? I mean, this thing doesn't do anything. I have so many better options than
[7047.27s -> 7063.80s]  just 12% more damage. Let me see. What can I turn it into? Mechanical glove,
[7065.27s -> 7072.60s]  melee speed. So I need to take this, take this and figure out how to upgrade that.
[7072.60s -> 7081.59s]  Cause we should have all this stuff to upgrade it. I was working on that, but I'm getting sidetracked
[7081.59s -> 7086.23s]  by like 30 things. Mechanical glove increases melee knockback, 12% damage and melee speed.
[7087.35s -> 7112.94s]  That sounds pretty good to me. Let's make it. We do have to be like one of these special
[7113.90s -> 7121.43s]  crafting benches or something. Um, it should be right here. This anvil,
[7121.43s -> 7126.23s]  I think either that or it's way over here. The tinker is table instead. It's a tinker.
[7127.11s -> 7136.36s]  Actually, what am I doing? I know what I'm doing. Mechanical glove. There it is.
[7137.16s -> 7155.54s]  Okay. So now I can, I mean, that's a lot. That's very fast. Okay. Looking good. Now
[7156.50s -> 7164.14s]  people are still yelling at me for these wings. What are those? Is that what they're saying? Um,
[7165.26s -> 7171.00s]  a little meaner, a little meaner than that. Uh, the one comment in particular said, um,
[7171.00s -> 7176.52s]  you are the stupidest person I've ever seen play this game. And then their name is not in chat
[7176.52s -> 7182.04s]  anymore. And so they're gone, I think. So, I mean, that was kind of like really like unfortunate,
[7182.04s -> 7185.80s]  like, okay. Uh, Chris may well knock back and inflict fire damage and attack.
[7186.94s -> 7198.58s]  I need a magma stone. Do we have any magma stones? Yeah. Here you go. Nice. All right. So
[7198.58s -> 7202.66s]  I'm just going to make this like super thing. I think there's one more step after that.
[7202.66s -> 7213.59s]  All right. My major is another step. Holy shit. Okay. Fire and consider this item.
[7215.35s -> 7225.61s]  What the fuck is that? Okay. Let's go here. Fire gauntlet. Elemental gauntlet. Do we have a
[7225.61s -> 7237.94s]  Yharnam insignia? Uh, no, I think we're very close to having one. I forget how to make it.
[7243.83s -> 7249.78s]  I'm doing my own thing. Okay. So what you gave me this Aegis thing. Yeah. It's immunity to fire
[7249.78s -> 7256.70s]  blocks and knockback. 40% max life. Increase health. Supreme holy flame dash. Activate buffs
[7256.70s -> 7261.10s]  to all damage. Crit chance. Any fan activities. Your movement speed. Increase enemy aggro.
[7262.38s -> 7271.19s]  Okay. I forget this. What was that? Why did I just did that in a turn tonight? I did that.
[7271.99s -> 7276.70s]  I thought it'd be funny. It's my gauntlet. My gauntlet versus the giver to the wings,
[7276.70s -> 7280.86s]  right? Because I don't, what's the point of having this if I have the flying saucer, right? Oh yeah.
[7282.38s -> 7287.02s]  True. Do you have a melee? Which is broom, which is better.
[7287.02s -> 7297.64s]  I'm forgetting how to actually make the good wings. Oh, we need luminite bars.
[7297.64s -> 7301.08s]  It's pendant. I don't need this pendant anymore either. I have like a useless pendant.
[7302.12s -> 7311.93s]  I got a couple of useless things. Oh my God. Let's just see how it goes. I'm willing. Let's
[7311.93s -> 7314.97s]  just, let's give it a little attempt here. I got more health, like a better armor.
[7316.71s -> 7334.97s]  So let's do some, let's go attack something. God damn it. I had to do this the long way.
[7335.77s -> 7340.55s]  I mean the long way. I think I turned off that other mod. I'm not using minions,
[7340.55s -> 7344.87s]  so why are you using the amulet? Is it, do we have anything that's better than this in the stash?
[7345.83s -> 7348.71s]  Better than what? Just, I have a useless slot right now.
[7350.60s -> 7354.84s]  Just look through equipment and there's a couple things. There's an item that's 15% damage under
[7354.84s -> 7359.80s]  50% health, which you'll be at because the other item. There's, there's some other things in there.
[7360.60s -> 7369.78s]  Um, uh, there's a lot of toys in this toy box. What am I doing?
[7372.84s -> 7378.04s]  15% increased melee damage. Here it is right here. And more, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[7379.48s -> 7387.50s]  there's the fungal spore. Look at that item. It's like a mushroom head. Your weapons don't count,
[7387.50s -> 7393.14s]  but you'll, you will get a weapon that will count. True melee weapons emit mushrooms when swung,
[7393.14s -> 7401.90s]  boost true melee damage by 25%. So what, what do you mean? True melee is like when your melee
[7401.90s -> 7406.54s]  weapon actually hits something and not the projectiles that make, okay. All right.
[7407.50s -> 7413.75s]  Does that, that includes the axes too, right? Uh, no, I don't think the axes count.
[7418.78s -> 7424.76s]  How you doing? Need help? Uh, we got to do the pillars again really fast.
[7424.76s -> 7436.10s]  Yes. We have to do the pillars again? Huh? Yeah. There's a, the only way to get luminite bars is
[7436.10s -> 7441.46s]  to kill moon lord. And I had a mod where you could like buy moon lord packs, but I think I turned it
[7441.46s -> 7448.90s]  off and forgot about it. It's like the only way we can get luminite again to my knowledge is by
[7448.90s -> 7459.43s]  doing all of the pillars to summon moon lord. Okay. I guess. Unless there's some other way to do it
[7459.43s -> 7464.74s]  that my mods enabled that I don't know of, but now that we're big strong boys, it goes really
[7464.74s -> 7471.42s]  quickly. We are pretty strong. All right. Uh, the number one thing that that's going to need to
[7471.42s -> 7476.46s]  happen though, is it's going to need to actually swan the enemies. Uh, Hey, you wait here. You're
[7476.46s -> 7497.13s]  going to do another wait here, please. Jeremy. Oh my God. Bed. I got to pee so bad. My God. I'm
[7497.13s -> 7519.88s]  going to pee my pants. I'll be, I'll be right there, bro. Um, dead. Okay. I'm getting off the
[7519.88s -> 7531.72s]  fucking thing. I don't, I don't even know what hit me. He's dead. They look gone. The super boost
[7531.72s -> 7537.99s]  accessory. Well, how did we get that? Super boost. Yeah. There's an item that lets you like run
[7539.27s -> 7544.79s]  as fast as you can see. It's ridiculous. Oh, why is there sand elementals coming out here?
[7546.44s -> 7553.93s]  Oh, the Ragnarok boss dropped it. It might be expert only. Well, that was very easy. That was
[7553.93s -> 7563.59s]  a very easy boss. I got it. Forbidden. I got to forbid something forbidden. You can craft it. I'll
[7563.59s -> 7569.27s]  see if I, maybe I picked it up or I would have to kill Ragnarok again. Or apparently I can craft it.
[7569.27s -> 7572.15s]  You guys might be thinking of something else because there's a couple of mods that add
[7572.15s -> 7589.22s]  similar things. Forbidden fragments are outdated now. That's okay. Astral ore. I got like orange
[7589.22s -> 7599.74s]  shit. This thing's dead. So I'm coming back to town. Okay. All right. Um, I have to pee.
[7599.74s -> 7604.70s]  So I'm going to go pee for the first time in my whole life. Go take a pee pee. I'll be right back.
[7611.16s -> 7666.41s]  Um, I'm just going to kill Ragnarok again. I'm getting, I've got my adrenaline. It's a joke,
[7666.41s -> 7676.86s]  by the way. You're supposed to laugh when I say that. Oh no, that boss doesn't drop it. I'm thinking
[7676.86s -> 7682.26s]  of the second phase that drops that. Do you remember the name of it, Ashley? Because I would
[7682.26s -> 7690.79s]  just go to our other server and like grab it. Or you could do that and you could join me. You could
[7690.79s -> 7694.95s]  like bring it here so I don't have to shut the server down and explain to Jerma how to join again.
[7694.95s -> 7700.07s]  Joining. He like despises joining Terraria servers even though it's like a steam invite.
[7708.33s -> 7713.30s]  I don't. I'm sure you could find it though. I would appreciate it very much and then we could
[7713.30s -> 7718.02s]  do your, your joke and then we can give it to him and I could, I could play the rest of the game
[7718.02s -> 7751.32s]  with it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You'll get the fee. We don't need to tell him about that boss. Oh dude,
[7751.32s -> 7755.80s]  does this thing drop Luminite? Is that what it was? Does this thing give fragments you don't have to
[7755.80s -> 7775.82s]  do? I remember that now. I'm going, I'm going to. I know he doesn't drop Luminite. I got some water.
[7776.46s -> 7791.66s]  I'm back. Hey, here. Maybe if you have an extra slot, there's that. Extra slot. That's right. I
[7791.66s -> 7800.28s]  do not, but one of these I think is useless for me. Yes. He won't pick up the essence as will he?
[7800.28s -> 7809.21s]  We have like 80 of every essence. Don't, don't worry guy. He doesn't know. Is there something
[7809.21s -> 7818.55s]  I should know? Sorry, is there something I need to know? No, there's nothing you need to know.
[7818.55s -> 7824.36s]  All right. Uh, chat, congratulations. You have just made, you're now on cool down. I will not
[7824.36s -> 7832.60s]  look at chat for five straight minutes. I want like an on screen chat, cool down, read-o meter.
[7834.68s -> 7839.48s]  That would be awesome. We're like after five minutes to your stream would even say streamer
[7839.48s -> 7844.76s]  must look at chat now. And then everyone would get their thing in. No, that would be a terrible
[7844.76s -> 7848.28s]  idea. Cause once I get the countdown, it would be like streamer look at chat now. And it would be
[7848.28s -> 7854.60s]  like crazy spam and everyone would get out of their system. Then you could just like in good
[7854.60s -> 7859.80s]  conscious and look away again. Like, okay, that I'm right. I've read you. Do you really want the
[7859.80s -> 7867.13s]  only thing that you looked at ever to be like, Oh, W O or like streamer sucks or like a bunch
[7867.13s -> 7874.38s]  of coffee pasta? What else are they going to say? I see some really, really good shit in chat.
[7874.38s -> 7888.81s]  Sometimes. I don't know about you. Oh, well, it doesn't like, it would just like make you feel
[7888.81s -> 7897.38s]  good inside though. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you say that. I mean, like when a cute girl
[7897.38s -> 7909.54s]  looks at you and it's like, Oh, right. What are you saying? Uh, anyways, that's coming out of my
[7909.54s -> 7915.72s]  video. You can keep that in yours if you want. I make one video. So that's coming out of it.
[7915.80s -> 7921.48s]  That's not going in my video. You can put that in yours. I'm not. I've never made a video.
[7922.60s -> 7935.93s]  I get that clip. God, it's so easy with the challenge. By the way, while I was peeing,
[7935.93s -> 7939.85s]  I decided that during the course of the P I was going to have a rating for Terraria.
[7941.45s -> 7947.93s]  Didn't we do this though? We're done. This is the final Terraria stream. So I have to give my final
[7947.93s -> 7952.65s]  score. And I, yeah, but before you were saying that you couldn't do it properly because it was,
[7954.09s -> 7958.97s]  it was what you said, like you, you thought Terraria was like messy and like too chaotic.
[7958.97s -> 7963.69s]  But I said, it's because there's mods and you've never played like basic Terraria and it was skewing
[7963.69s -> 7968.49s]  your, your review. Yeah, that's fine. And you agreed, but now you're going to review it. Well,
[7968.49s -> 7973.77s]  I have to say like my final thoughts on the game. We just get up behind the podium. The floor is
[7973.77s -> 7978.65s]  yours. I'm going to give you some, uh, noise crowd noise here. Uh, sure.
[7986.01s -> 7988.81s]  I think that was fun. I think I deserve something for that one. I really do.
[7991.77s -> 8002.14s]  I think I deserve something for that. I don't know. Here, do it one more time.
[8002.54s -> 8012.46s]  Click, click, click, click, click. Okay. Yeah, that was spot on. Thank you. But I
[8012.46s -> 8017.02s]  have no preparation at all. And you just do that on me. I come on. I think I deserve at least
[8018.06s -> 8022.54s]  like an extra letter grade higher on my, um, test for that one. Uh, people who missed this
[8022.54s -> 8029.21s]  joke from before are really confused. That's all right. Uh, no, I worry about them because
[8029.21s -> 8038.71s]  when I have to look at my child, I worry about them. Why haven't you ever just worried about
[8038.71s -> 8056.76s]  the one before? So we have to, uh, defeat moon, uh, the moon. I have to defeat the moon. Uh,
[8056.76s -> 8062.44s]  oh, oh, who's down there? Who's down there? That was me. Well, they're dead now.
[8063.64s -> 8076.01s]  So what's going on? You, are we, are we, uh, summoning? Do your best. Like the S like
[8076.01s -> 8086.34s]  simplest thing. That is awful. No one wants to hear that. That was pretty good. That was really
[8086.34s -> 8096.39s]  good. That was so good. I've never been like happier that I've said something there. That
[8096.39s -> 8108.23s]  was perfect. I can't do that again, but just this time to say something, say like something, uh,
[8113.99s -> 8126.15s]  why he's following me. I'm too far in the sky. I can't help you. You're like leading him away.
[8130.47s -> 8140.47s]  Okay. Now I get to be the big brother. How do I hurt him? How do I hurt the moon guy?
[8141.19s -> 8161.54s]  The brain go for the brain. How do you hurt this guy? You had a chance to be the big bro.
[8162.26s -> 8167.96s]  What was that? Not hitting him in the right place. The brain, right? His right hand had a,
[8168.92s -> 8188.74s]  a little bit left on it. I need that. You don't even know what to do with it. Yeah, I don't.
[8189.22s -> 8199.38s]  Fair hurtful angels. And I need the Luma night moon Lord trophy, portal gun,
[8200.92s -> 8204.92s]  reckless terraria, which what is this? This is cool. This looks kind of cool.
[8205.48s -> 8210.39s]  Here. You want, should I take this other onion? No, you can't use them again.
[8211.27s -> 8216.07s]  Sorry. Invite me. I, you can just join Ashley. You don't need to be invited here. Uh,
[8216.39s -> 8233.03s]  what did you actually want? Luminate. I don't know. Is, is, is, is that a, uh,
[8235.13s -> 8241.64s]  I'll find it eventually. I'm never picking up anything ever again. Thank you. Did you get it?
[8244.39s -> 8250.04s]  No, I don't think so. You want to do all the pillars again because you picked this up and
[8250.12s -> 8258.25s]  like, you can't find it. I promise. I don't know where it is. Luminate, Luminate or I got there.
[8258.25s -> 8289.11s]  He did not drop it. Oh my God. He's a good, this is a cool house. Did I just do all that
[8289.11s -> 8308.49s]  for a pair of wings? Did you think so? Yeah, I think so. All right. So I've got this,
[8308.49s -> 8313.91s]  this can be upgraded. What should I upgrade that to? That's the question that I have.
[8315.91s -> 8336.42s]  The yo-yo. Oh, I want to see this insane knockback. Ruthless. This to thrower class
[8337.62s -> 8345.62s]  somebody who uses it. You'll have this like save file from like five years.
[8346.66s -> 8349.96s]  You'll have like some friend eventually that like it gets to this point and you're like,
[8349.96s -> 8356.84s]  oh, I remember this. Actually, you saved a frog leg and I have no idea where you got it from.
[8357.56s -> 8361.16s]  I had to like when me and Ash were playing come here and steal the frog leg because
[8362.12s -> 8368.44s]  I don't know what, where it's dropping in the mod, what's happening with it. You don't get those.
[8371.72s -> 8375.80s]  All right, I did something. I think it's from fishing, but no one was fishing. It's like a
[8375.80s -> 8380.12s]  mod added a different way to get a frog leg and he had it and it was in the storage and I don't
[8380.12s -> 8391.82s]  know why. I couldn't figure it out. I did something. All right, so what's happening now?
[8394.31s -> 8405.38s]  You tell me. What do you want to do? What's the next like milestone? You tell me. I mean,
[8405.38s -> 8417.14s]  this is all extra. We already beat the game. I mean, you tell me. I don't know where we go.
[8417.94s -> 8426.89s]  Can I talk to Lucy or are you in the, can I get in there? Can I get in there? Yeah, you can get
[8426.89s -> 8440.22s]  in there. She's all yours. Let's see. I like this. Just get five of everything. Fuck it.
[8441.18s -> 8457.13s]  Archery, summoning. I don't need that anymore. I need like damage. Is it like a melee damage
[8457.13s -> 8462.26s]  potion that I haven't been taking? There's a crumbling potion in the calamity mod
[8462.26s -> 8466.42s]  potions. That's really good lowers defense when you melee hit. Oh, that sounds cool.
[8466.98s -> 8484.01s]  I'll go do that. All right. Calamity mod pots. It's not going to let me connect.
[8485.27s -> 8497.16s]  Do you have the item, Ashley? What is it called? You wouldn't have it. Can you put it somewhere
[8497.16s -> 8503.58s]  that I can just like shut the server down for a second and go get it? Or what's the name of it?
[8510.79s -> 8520.82s]  Crumbling, crumbling. Right, right, right. Oh yeah. Ashley, what's the name of it?
[8523.78s -> 8534.07s]  I'll just look up how to get it. It's cool. Yeah, I'm just gonna get all this shit.
[8534.55s -> 8557.14s]  This stuff looks insane. Does Star have VR? Yes, we mean Star played VR before.
[8557.94s -> 8567.05s]  We've done a multiplayer virtual reality stream. We played tennis. That was that was a hoop.
[8569.70s -> 8572.74s]  Oh yeah, it has to be expert mode. So I'm going to change it to expert mode.
[8573.54s -> 8579.43s]  What? Why are you doing that? So I can get an item from Ragnarok.
[8579.43s -> 8603.19s]  An item from Ragnarok. Oh, we have the stuff for this. It's in one minute. He's going to read the
[8603.19s -> 8633.64s]  chat. Get your oo's ready. Get them ready. Yes. Where are we going? Hold on. I'm doing shit.
[8635.18s -> 8665.30s]  So guys, donuts next to me. What? Let's go fight stuff. I'm going to test my might.
[8665.30s -> 8669.94s]  I like really specifically need a thorium anvil. I'm going to like punch someone in the freaking
[8669.94s -> 8713.05s]  mouth. If I like a soul forge isn't good enough. Okay. It's the name of my mind. You gotta have it.
[8713.05s -> 8758.95s]  No. Jarrah's bored in his own stream. No, what? I love doing that. Like turn on friendly fire and
[8758.95s -> 8767.72s]  get him. Okay, here we go. Hey Star, turn on friendly fire for a second. I don't want to
[8767.72s -> 8790.04s]  just take to lose nothing. Wait till he turns it on. What the fuck was that?
[8790.84s -> 8806.38s]  Okay. Why is Chewbacca in this game? 30 years later. Okay. Jarrah, I'm tired. Can I go to
[8806.38s -> 8813.62s]  sleep please? Yeah. You can go to bed. And now I can't make the Ragnarok emblem. What am I missing?
[8821.61s -> 8828.90s]  And now I will do a series of voices while I drink water. Here we go.
[8834.50s -> 8864.44s]  I can't believe it. I know. Absolutely amazing. Start up. We don't have vortex fragments. What?
[8864.44s -> 8875.21s]  When did that happen? Everybody. Jarrah stole them all. Nobody likes that one. Well, that was a
[8875.21s -> 8879.21s]  board joke. That wasn't a real joke. You want a real job. Jarrah, did you steal all the vortex
[8879.21s -> 8887.43s]  fragments? Uh, yeah. I walked by them because they were on the ground. Oh, give it to me.
[8888.15s -> 8892.58s]  What the hell are you doing, little bro? I just picked them up. What just happened?
[8897.03s -> 8901.75s]  Yes. And here's the other ones he dropped. I promise I didn't just try to throw them down the
[8901.75s -> 8912.22s]  well. And for my next drink. Okay. Uh, you have not seen this boss before. Ooh, new material.
[8942.71s -> 8956.34s]  Oh, did you even make good wings, did you? You didn't get good wings. No. And here comes
[8956.34s -> 8974.39s]  dying reality. What's dying reality? Oh, the Ragnarok. Where is this enemy we're fighting?
[8975.19s -> 8978.79s]  It's the circle with the health bar that's right next to you. And because every enemy
[8978.79s -> 8989.38s]  follows you for some reason. Whoa. I insta died. Like I had full health. What happened? Holy shit.
[8990.82s -> 9004.73s]  When you say you had full health, you mean you had half health? No, I had like at least
[9004.73s -> 9015.10s]  like 80, 70% or 80%. I got really at least got to see the fireworks. Okay. I got the thing.
[9015.82s -> 9026.79s]  You got a thing that you were looking for? I got the thing that I was looking for. Nice. Now my
[9026.79s -> 9034.12s]  wife is happy. I got a Ragnarok treasure bag. Should I open it? Yeah. And then you're going
[9034.12s -> 9043.88s]  to want to put on the Omega core. Whoa. The Omega core raises movement speed beyond comprehension.
[9044.60s -> 9054.62s]  What do I replace? Are you wearing boots? Wait, it takes the place of boots. You don't need boots
[9054.62s -> 9065.61s]  anymore. Um, I don't, I don't like this. I can't use this. This is why I can't play Sonic the Hedgehog.
[9065.61s -> 9070.92s]  This is Sonic the Hedgehog levels of speed. Well, you have to play with it until the game's over
[9070.92s -> 9076.52s]  now. That's what Ashley says. And I mean, does this work in my spaceship? Who runs the world? Girls,
[9077.40s -> 9089.62s]  does this work in the spaceship? No, it doesn't. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, but it's
[9089.62s -> 9098.58s]  okay. I will deal with it. It's cool though. Nice. You sound like entranced. What about the
[9098.58s -> 9104.02s]  master tides? Here, I'm going to make you good wings. Do you even want wings? Are you going to
[9104.02s -> 9109.54s]  be in your like a dummy? I mean, the UFOs, these wings are faster than UFO. Just take this stuff
[9109.54s -> 9116.84s]  because I don't know what it does. Yes. Give me the wings. We're done with this horse shit.
[9118.28s -> 9126.98s]  Thanks for making me throw up. I'm sorry. I didn't want to do the Sonic the Hedgehog
[9126.98s -> 9140.71s]  super speed thing. Here's wings. Angry Stardust wings allows flight and snowfall. Great value.
[9140.71s -> 9158.47s]  Okay. What should this replace? What should this replace? I don't know, dude. True melee damage.
[9159.27s -> 9175.86s]  More. I'm exploring the world. I keep hitting planets. Place the shroom. No, I want to place
[9175.86s -> 9189.69s]  this Omega core. Is this faster than the spaceship? It is. Yeah, it is. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for trying
[9189.69s -> 9197.24s]  it before asking the question. Okay. You're ready. Um, hold on. I can take the shroom off.
[9198.20s -> 9209.91s]  Okay. Oh, I got to take off my dash. My dash like very randomly throws me
[9210.79s -> 9216.47s]  in a, this is, I would, I would quantify this. I would quantify this as not fun. I'm gonna take
[9216.47s -> 9225.93s]  them off. I'm dead. I just ran into the side. So did I. The dash is what's getting me.
[9226.81s -> 9235.83s]  I would quantify that is breaks the game to a point where it's, it's, it hurts me. It hurts me
[9235.91s -> 9248.57s]  to do this. I can't even pick up this stuff on the, can we take this off? I don't know.
[9249.75s -> 9262.65s]  I don't know what's giving me the dash, but now I'm really slow. This one. I'm so slow now though.
[9266.82s -> 9293.56s]  Man, I'm too fast. I'm too slow. Put the boots back on instead of this room. Baby rage, baby rage.
[9295.82s -> 9305.74s]  Make the angel threads. Star, can you make me the angel threads? Yeah. Thanks. You already made them.
[9306.38s -> 9318.22s]  I mean, yeah, I've been wearing them. I took them off for the Omega core. Oh, that was dumb.
[9323.18s -> 9327.90s]  I am the alpha and the Omega, right? Is that what you always used to say to me?
[9329.46s -> 9334.02s]  I don't think I've ever said those words. No, like whenever you're making a video and you want it,
[9334.02s -> 9338.18s]  something to be a certain way, you just say, I am the alpha and the Omega. And then you always got
[9338.18s -> 9346.23s]  what you want it in a mean voice or in like a, just like telling you that no, like a holier than bow
[9346.23s -> 9357.85s]  kind of thing. I am the alpha and the Omega. Okay, hello. There's more light. So what's next?
[9359.42s -> 9391.99s]  Ravager. Ravager. I love shooting the bubbles. So hard to control. It's funny. Like I, I,
[9391.99s -> 9401.27s]  I fly up so slowly and yet if I tap left or right, I'm gone. I almost just whacked it. No, no, no,
[9401.27s -> 9410.66s]  no, no, no, no, no, no. I was saying it and he crushed my God. And my next trick,
[9411.22s -> 9416.20s]  I am going to drink a glass of water while Star does voices. Be amazed.
[9418.92s -> 9420.68s]  Don't make mouth noises into the mic, Jerma.
[9423.50s -> 9446.39s]  Well, it was close. I added an extra one. I did the part after that. I was, that was the next part
[9446.39s -> 9457.14s]  of the, of the, I'm proud of you that you could admit that you did it wrong. Why is everybody
[9457.14s -> 9462.82s]  blaming me for the gross noise you made? I was just drinking water and you did the gross noise.
[9462.82s -> 9466.34s]  I didn't do that. No, you like prepared noises for your drink because you thought it would be
[9466.34s -> 9471.38s]  funny. And if it didn't go, like your joke didn't stick. I said you to do voices, not go like,
[9474.79s -> 9478.71s]  I said Star is going to do voices while I drink out of this cup. And then you just made a bunch
[9478.71s -> 9489.45s]  of mouth noises. That wasn't a voice. What? So it's my fault. No, it's both of our faults.
[9489.45s -> 9493.85s]  Yeah. You're really fun to work with. Hey, anyone want to do any like work with Jerma?
[9494.81s -> 9500.28s]  We'll throw you under the bus. Yeah. I've like read, I've read a bunch of shit about Jerma.
[9500.28s -> 9503.96s]  Like I like his streams and everything, but he's apparently really, really hard to work with.
[9504.68s -> 9509.48s]  He's like notorious, like throwing tantrums on before broadcasts and everything. He's really
[9509.48s -> 9513.00s]  hard to work with. You wouldn't believe the things you said to me before we started today.
[9513.72s -> 9518.28s]  Like even I bet I've met him at like events and parties and he's like a super dick.
[9519.24s -> 9530.36s]  Yeah. I know why we didn't play for three weeks. Broad, bro, mega low caster.
[9535.99s -> 9547.62s]  I swear to you, I made an onk. Did you? I think you did. I do remember that. No, you weren't here.
[9553.16s -> 9558.28s]  I'm just trying to, to seem like we're working together. I'm just trying to make it seem like
[9559.40s -> 9563.32s]  we're, Hey, we're doing this thing. I remember you made the onky. You weren't here for that.
[9563.40s -> 9568.60s]  He just threw me under the bus. Well, I'm not going to let you lie to everyone.
[9572.01s -> 9574.89s]  Here it is again. Jerma like wants to look good in front of everyone,
[9576.28s -> 9583.98s]  even if it means his friends have to lie for him. Okay. And we're going to kill the ravager.
[9584.78s -> 9591.58s]  Oh, again, that was fun when we died both together. Like we didn't do it. Dude, I can't,
[9591.58s -> 9600.41s]  I can't control. All right. I'm ready. All right. Come on. I'm getting, I'm getting
[9600.41s -> 9606.09s]  damage reduction. You just said to do it. And I activated my pots. It'll be like two seconds.
[9606.09s -> 9614.34s]  I only have three minutes. It takes longer than three minutes. I'm setting up my minds.
[9614.98s -> 9666.73s]  Okay. You ready? Who is that? Let's do it again. Oh my God. He just disappeared because I went
[9666.73s -> 9698.49s]  too far. God damn it. I can't not go that far. I can only hear this in my one ear. How far would
[9698.49s -> 9721.38s]  you go? I need to hear this. I'm right here. That wasn't that bad. That was nothing. Are you
[9721.38s -> 9746.44s]  fighting? Yeah. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I feel like a snail when I, when I fly up. Get the fuck away
[9746.44s -> 9755.86s]  from the guy. Get away from the guy. What's this guy? This guy following me. They come through the
[9755.86s -> 9797.37s]  fucking goddamn things. I'm too fast. Don't die. Don't run away. Nice. Nice. The ravager.
[9799.59s -> 9806.63s]  You do 20% more damage. Take 20% less damage. Do 20% more lifesteal. Take a hundred percent
[9806.63s -> 9822.57s]  more damage when you are not standing still. Fucking cool item. Gain an increase to all damage
[9822.57s -> 9827.37s]  reduce light wing time. All right. Whatever. Oh, he drops blood stones. That's what it was.
[9828.17s -> 9844.71s]  Blood ocean. Blood orb. And the phantom heart. Ravager is pinwheel. We don't have blood orbs?
[9845.69s -> 9855.16s]  How do we not have blood orbs, Jerma? I can't even get in this hole. Is this,
[9855.16s -> 9859.82s]  is this a joke where I have this in my inventory and I don't know? I don't think so.
[9860.78s -> 9872.46s]  Nah, I bought a bunch. Is stir going to fight the four celestial towers? Nope. I'm sorry. I'm gonna be,
[9873.34s -> 9879.10s]  I have to, I gotta butt in here and fix that. Is stir and then in parentheses after that
[9879.74s -> 9885.42s]  and watching Jerma and parentheses going to do, I just want to be, I want to clear up what you just
[9885.42s -> 9902.52s]  said. Okay. Stir and parentheses and Jerma's eyes and then, and parentheses. I mean, I am watching.
[9902.52s -> 9918.23s]  I am seeing it happen. Is stir and then parentheses and Jerma's respawn scream
[9918.23s -> 9924.89s]  and parentheses going to continue to do the celestial? That's so funny. That's a good one.
[9926.23s -> 9929.03s]  Typically I would fucking time you out for something like that and making fun of the
[9929.03s -> 9943.24s]  streamer. But I mean, come on, that's pretty good. Are you using that 25%
[9943.32s -> 9950.12s]  intramally thing? Uh, no. Would you like it? No, I'm just, you might want to.
[9951.48s -> 9958.30s]  I have the angel treads, the fire gauntlet. Here, take this weapon. Okay.
[9963.62s -> 9970.58s]  This thing is too, all right. I will have to reforge it. Seven,
[9970.66s -> 9978.71s]  17, was it 1770, 1662. Is that the year you were born?
[9981.05s -> 9987.80s]  Just give out your password on stream. I don't have 39 gold. What the hell?
[9989.50s -> 10000.57s]  I, I dropped a lot of my money. So did I. Do we have any platinum left in the bank? We don't,
[10000.57s -> 10010.71s]  we don't have any money. You know how to fix that. Sell, uh, something I have. Honestly, like sell
[10010.71s -> 10018.57s]  all that. No, I don't want you to do that. Nevermind. They just called this a pleb house.
[10020.17s -> 10033.90s]  We use a Zerg potion and just kill everything. Okay. They know it'll get in here.
[10035.48s -> 10050.39s]  Oh, it'll be able to get in here. I didn't know this was like a artillery thing. Doesn't,
[10050.39s -> 10055.19s]  I can't remember what bow I was using in the other game, where I got it from. Anyway, we got
[10055.19s -> 10065.19s]  to go to space. Space. That means I get to be in this. I think we need cosplay. So we'll just
[10065.19s -> 10074.87s]  hurry this up and, ah, okay. So the storm weaver has awoken. Hopefully he doesn't instantly run
[10074.87s -> 10084.54s]  away. But he's a two faced worm that comes up to space to fight you. Why am I, why am I still in
[10084.54s -> 10092.54s]  that? I, what am I, get out of the, um, I was trying to get out of the fucking UFO and like,
[10092.54s -> 10101.72s]  I got, uh, I was in the UFO, which was slow as shit. I'm, I'm throwing it in the trash
[10101.72s -> 10121.78s]  so I don't do that again. I heard that burp. Hey, did you come up here and pick up items?
[10121.78s -> 10129.53s]  I'm going to scream at you. I came up. Why, what did I do? What did you pick up? I don't know. I
[10129.53s -> 10135.05s]  just came back up here and I ended up coming. What did you pick up? Armored shell, storm dragon,
[10135.69s -> 10142.74s]  Mag, uh, Magnum rounds. Drop it off. Just drop it off. Do you think I'm not going to take care of
[10142.74s -> 10154.31s]  you? I think that's pretty much it. Is that what it is? I don't know if I got that now. I don't
[10154.31s -> 10179.22s]  know if I got that too. Okay. We've got to go to hell. Okay. What the hell was that? You can't hurt
[10179.22s -> 10214.95s]  them. What's that? Oh my boat does not even work here. You're gonna kill it. I'm trying. It's a
[10214.95s -> 10240.97s]  ghost. I thought you were like a fan of that movie. I'm not afraid to know ghosts. Remember
[10240.97s -> 10252.84s]  that one? Should I go, should I respond and pick everything up again? Did you? No. Okay. Okay. So
[10252.84s -> 10257.96s]  now where are we going? So that you can summon the other boss and then this is like the boss
[10260.52s -> 10276.10s]  before the boss. Hold on. Let me just, let me die again. Waiting for you to die. Okay. So what,
[10276.10s -> 10286.23s]  what are we doing now? I'm trying to remember how to summon the boss. You just made a pizza.
[10286.23s -> 10297.50s]  Want some? That just doesn't sound bad. Armored shell, twisting nether. Did I get twisting nether?
[10298.22s -> 10308.04s]  I should have it. I don't have the drops from the boss. What? I got a hellstone brick. Yeah,
[10308.04s -> 10316.78s]  I got an unholy essence. Twisting nether. I don't know where that is. Yeah, the boss we just fought
[10316.78s -> 10320.14s]  should have dropped twisting nether. Did you pick it up? I have it. Okay. You threw it to me.
[10320.70s -> 10330.76s]  I just did it. Thank you. Thank you, little bro. You're welcome. I need potions. We didn't get any
[10330.76s -> 10341.51s]  money, did we? Not really, no. We're gonna, we're gonna need them. This is a tough fight.
[10342.39s -> 10350.60s]  When I say before, like, oh, he's setting up. Listen to me. This is a tough fight. Sounds fun.
[10365.54s -> 10372.57s]  We do need money, though. I need potions. I don't have any. I have healing potions,
[10372.57s -> 10379.42s]  but not anything else. I mean, like, does it matter? I'm kind of, you said this is the hardest thing
[10379.42s -> 10386.14s]  we've done. Yeah. How am I supposed to do the hardest thing we've ever done without my, like,
[10386.14s -> 10395.70s]  15 potions I drink before each boss? The devourer of gods made me bite my desk, and there are several
[10395.70s -> 10412.28s]  bite marks. He's right. He's right. Insane chat. Let's get you some money. Insane chat. I just
[10412.28s -> 10417.16s]  imagine the front of your desk with just, like, teeth impressions from the dentist office,
[10417.16s -> 10426.01s]  just all over the front. How do you explain that to anybody, by the way? If anybody comes over
[10426.01s -> 10429.53s]  your house and goes in your room and goes to your desk, there are bite marks all over your desk. What
[10429.53s -> 10435.86s]  are you going to tell them? Come to me. That's what I'm going to tell them. That's what you can
[10435.86s -> 10460.82s]  earn some cash. You can tell them you have a flavored desk. I mean, that would be, you could
[10460.82s -> 10490.23s]  say that. But would they believe you? Then they'd want to try it. You getting money? Yeah, I think
[10490.23s -> 10499.16s]  so. I'll be honest. I have no idea. This is a better way to do this. All I know is there are,
[10500.12s -> 10505.08s]  my screen's full of things. I don't know what I think. Things are happening. That's all I know.
[10506.20s -> 10527.32s]  There's a better way to do this. Hold on. Get in there. Please don't spam the chat.
[10528.94s -> 10534.62s]  I think I have some money now. I've got 17 gold, which is not a whole lot, but it's something.
[10535.58s -> 10546.94s]  Murray, where did you go? How much do you have? 17 gold. 19 gold. Yeah, it's on the down.
[10550.39s -> 10560.04s]  Hold on. I've got a plan. Have you ever wanted to eat something non-edible, like nice smelling
[10560.04s -> 10572.50s]  soap? Yes. There is a store that sells soap. If you guys have ever heard of Lush, there's a
[10572.50s -> 10578.58s]  chain of, they've got all kinds of weird, like cheese soaps in there. And by cheese soap,
[10578.58s -> 10583.94s]  I mean, they have these gigantic wheels of soap cheese that sit on these mantles and they have
[10583.94s -> 10590.18s]  to carve off of these giant soap wheels. You know, just stuff for your shower, your bath,
[10590.18s -> 10597.46s]  or whatever. There is a lemon zest candy smelling soap cheese wheel thing in there.
[10599.94s -> 10603.38s]  I feel like if you ate it, it would be okay.
[10605.94s -> 10614.39s]  Probably. You'd probably get a really bad stomach ache, but that first bite would be like,
[10614.47s -> 10621.78s]  hmm. But then you, yeah, after about five seconds, you'd be like, wait, no, no, no, no.
[10622.82s -> 10628.95s]  But they have like a honey. They've got this like honey smelling soap. It looks like a honeycomb.
[10628.95s -> 10634.92s]  It looks so delicious. When's the last time you ate one of these?
[10635.72s -> 10639.16s]  I've never because that's a bad idea. You shouldn't do that. Nobody should do that.
[10639.16s -> 10643.00s]  How do you know that that's a bad idea? Because it's, oh, you had the electro
[10643.00s -> 10649.24s]  Roombas in here the whole time. You fucking god. It's chemicals and you don't eat chemicals.
[10649.24s -> 10655.88s]  It's a stupid idea. Don't do that. German doesn't even know that the electro Roombas
[10655.88s -> 10662.68s]  give you like 40 platinum. Add that to the list of things that I don't fucking know in this game.
[10664.04s -> 10675.62s]  12 platinum for selling these like, come on, dude. Come on. I got so mad at my apple. I gave it bite
[10675.62s -> 10691.29s]  marks. Biting my desk. I can't imagine. First of all, what kind of desk do you have?
[10693.30s -> 10696.42s]  If you don't have a wooden desk, that's even more concerning.
[10702.44s -> 10708.12s]  It's a grape desk. Oh, I know that. I know those. It's a cheesecake desk.
[10709.50s -> 10717.99s]  You know, there's some fucked up billionaire in the world that has like a food office.
[10722.20s -> 10726.20s]  This shit doesn't even work. He goes in there and pretends to go on his
[10727.40s -> 10735.75s]  like hamburger fucking mice, his cheesecake desk, his monitors. They're made out of like glass candy.
[10736.79s -> 10741.27s]  He doesn't do anything in there. He just goes in there and just goes, yeah, I could afford this.
[10741.35s -> 10744.63s]  And like it takes one bite and then somebody goes in there and replaces it.
[10745.83s -> 10759.27s]  Come on, dude. Come on. Oh, I can't believe you know the platinum thing.
[10765.72s -> 10773.21s]  Help, help them. These people, they mean nothing to me. Holy shit. That guy just shot that dude in
[10773.21s -> 10787.69s]  the face. Damn. I don't mean anything to me. What fucked up thing would I do if I was a billionaire?
[10788.78s -> 10793.50s]  Okay, get up here and then you can tell us all about German world. No, um,
[10794.14s -> 10802.81s]  it's all there. Wait, we don't have a money problem anymore. What? Why are you summoning
[10802.81s -> 10821.93s]  plant? I'm going in. There's a view somewhere. I don't, I don't know where. Why are you sending
[10821.93s -> 10829.37s]  plant arrow? Oh, they didn't drop anything. I was just summoning a bunch of them so that we could
[10829.37s -> 10835.37s]  sell everything they dropped for money. And then they didn't drop anything. I would put it into
[10835.37s -> 10846.81s]  like dragon egg research, try to like hatch a dragon. I know this doesn't even work like,
[10846.89s -> 10858.30s]  oh, that guy didn't even get a chance. What am I, what am I doing with myself?
[10858.30s -> 10866.06s]  This is all so that you could buy potions. Come here, son. Take six platinum. Wait.
[10874.95s -> 10881.53s]  Wait, that's not what I want. And then we're going to fight the God worm. God worm. Nice.
[10882.49s -> 10886.49s]  Uh, so what, what is the best, what's the best potions I should be buying and like having
[10886.49s -> 10893.29s]  actually, uh, the Yarnham stimulant, the crumbling potion, yarnings, titan, crumbling, invincibility,
[10893.29s -> 10913.24s]  wrath, endurance, Yarnham, Yarnham stimulus, calamity. What else? The photosynthesis,
[10914.04s -> 10925.54s]  soaring. Just get one each. One of each. Get one. I'm just going to buy one of each.
[10926.50s -> 10940.26s]  Nevermind. Um, what's going on with chat? I accidentally, oh, okay. What? That's not,
[10940.26s -> 10948.07s]  that's not going to happen here. All right. Uh, fortitude. No, non-calamity.
[10949.03s -> 10957.05s]  I want my regular potions now. Where's the old guy?
[10957.85s -> 10983.24s]  What's this? Wrath. Max life. You ready? Um, hold on. Titan. Okay. I'm gonna like see how many
[10983.24s -> 10987.48s]  laps I can do around the fucking planet. Cause I'm the flash before like my friends, right?
[10988.36s -> 11009.38s]  Who also mutes himself. I hit L. I hit L. All right. Okay. Now let's do it. I'm coming to you.
[11011.34s -> 11015.72s]  You're already here. Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Let's do this. So what are we doing? What's the,
[11015.72s -> 11021.24s]  what is this thing that we're currently doing? It's, it's a worm. The worm. All right. It's the
[11021.24s -> 11044.50s]  worm. I'm ready. Let's worm it up. Holy shit. It's fast. I'm scared. I drew, I brought it to
[11044.50s -> 11049.14s]  the other side of the world. What? By accident. It was fast enough to like go the whole way. It's
[11049.14s -> 11063.64s]  coming. I haven't, I haven't seen it. I have, I don't even know what it looks like. Oh, there it
[11063.64s -> 11090.02s]  is. Okay. This is phase one. Phase one. Yeah. This thing is long. It's too long. I'm trying,
[11090.02s -> 11095.70s]  I'm trying to let my little brother fight it. So I'm like staying still near this area. He was
[11095.70s -> 11107.70s]  covering the whole ground. That thing was long. Holy shit. My brother, I haven't even seen what
[11107.70s -> 11118.86s]  it looks like. Okay, boy. Oh, all the guys are dead. Oh, I kind of needed potions. Whatever.
[11118.86s -> 11132.71s]  Ready? Hold on a second. Okay. Does it like gain my speed or something? Cause it just suddenly
[11132.71s -> 11139.99s]  jumped like a million miles an hour when I flew up. Doesn't this thing match the speed of the
[11139.99s -> 11155.82s]  player? Yeah, I'm noticing that. Oh shit. Wow. I'm noticing it. I forgot to get to it.
[11155.82s -> 11162.31s]  I don't worry. German's muted again. You don't have to listen to him. How is that possible?
[11162.31s -> 11181.22s]  I didn't do anything. I didn't press L. It's head and tail take normal damage. Its body is
[11181.22s -> 11186.26s]  resistant. I mean, I still did all right damage, but he just kind of, he just did the snake thing.
[11186.26s -> 11191.98s]  He just wrapped around and went. Oh shit. Somebody just gave a fucking hundred bucks.
[11193.35s -> 11197.43s]  Uh, amnestic. Oh w thanks for the a hundred dollars. Turn up the music.
[11198.39s -> 11204.90s]  I know I'm thanking somebody, but thank you so much. Sorry. I'm sorry. Fucking bucks.
[11204.90s -> 11221.75s]  But I brought it up. Turn up the music. Do what? Turn up the music there. I like need the potions.
[11224.74s -> 11230.01s]  I have eight of each like decent one. You want some, you want me to split them with you?
[11231.59s -> 11236.47s]  No, actually I have good enough ones. All right. So I think low now.
[11238.15s -> 11244.70s]  So he matches the speed of the player. Is that what you're saying? He might.
[11245.50s -> 11246.90s]  Okay. Well,
[11253.93s -> 11255.53s]  wrapping around.
[11277.42s -> 11281.99s]  It's like my flight time is lower than it should be. I still have the ravager thing in my inventory.
[11282.95s -> 11317.56s]  He's coming. Oh no, please. No dear God. I ran out of juice. Stay alive. Now I'm mad.
[11320.92s -> 11330.90s]  Holy fuck. I just almost instantly died. Can we do it? Does he not have a phase two or is
[11330.90s -> 11338.78s]  this phase two garbage on normal? Or wait, no, he summons all of these guys and then you get phase
[11338.78s -> 11360.70s]  two. What do you mean then? Leave me the fuck alone. I'm trying to eat this thing. Zero point.
[11370.31s -> 11387.00s]  Jesus Christ, man. It's fucking this is like intensity. The video game storm weaver.
[11389.72s -> 11396.50s]  Okay. Now it's now it's this guy that we fought before and then it's the guy again.
[11397.46s -> 11427.98s]  Yeah, where's he going to do this again? Yeah, except this time more. Oh Lord. Holy shit. I
[11427.98s -> 11432.86s]  just got fucking air shot. I'm dead.
[11432.86s -> 11466.15s]  Yeah. I think I saw this ravager shit in my cotton inventory. I can fly for like a second.
[11466.15s -> 11485.29s]  I'm going to bite my desk. You were warned. You're going to I'm going for it. Hey,
[11485.29s -> 11510.87s]  don't worry. He's at 80%. Oh, boy. I've really done it now. I've really done it now. I've done
[11510.87s -> 11523.40s]  it. Oh, now you've done it. Clicked out of my window so many times. Let's play.
[11532.36s -> 11542.22s]  I did it too. Fuck. I did not want to go into space. Please don't die, Jerma. Oh, no. I just
[11542.22s -> 11545.50s]  clicked out of my fucking window. Don't give me this counter responsibility with the giant worm.
[11545.50s -> 11573.51s]  I summoned the ravager by accident because if you hold down your mouse and you shoot at the top
[11573.51s -> 11579.03s]  left of your screen, it will click the things in your inventory. All right. Explain to me why
[11579.03s -> 11583.27s]  I just clicked out of my window again. Why in the name of fucking God is that possible?
[11584.47s -> 11593.18s]  Just playing full screen dummy. I almost just turned off my VPN accidentally and would have
[11593.18s -> 11605.45s]  like my stream were turned off. Lock the hot bar. How? I can't believe I actually summoned
[11605.45s -> 11618.54s]  ravager. What do I do? Oh, I never know. At least ravagers like these ones.
[11626.81s -> 11649.35s]  Jesus, I'm dead. Oh, where are you? Oh, I thought it was following me. Are you good? Yeah.
[11653.10s -> 11656.30s]  You've managed to go that way. Are you? Are you? Are you guys going that way?
[11657.02s -> 11665.86s]  Yeah, we're going this way. Going that way. Okay. I mean, sometimes life gives you lemons
[11676.79s -> 11683.50s]  out of the fucking window again. I don't know how I pressed like a different. I didn't even.
[11683.50s -> 11699.06s]  I pressed like a different mouse button. Are you doing this way? Okay. Why is he in the background?
[11699.06s -> 11709.10s]  He's too good for you. Jesus, man. I'm going to die again here. You want to bite your desk?
[11711.32s -> 11725.50s]  Not yet. No. Don't die. Oh, duh. I'm okay. I really wish I had those boots I gave to
[11725.50s -> 11739.00s]  Jerma right now. Are you good? Are you coming? I'm respawning. You good? Are you good? You back?
[11739.80s -> 11799.86s]  My lord, I'm going to die. I'm dead. And I am. Spawned again. Oh, I almost had a holy fire or
[11799.86s -> 11807.61s]  whatever. Oh, my fingers just hitting so many buttons. It's too intense for me. Did we lose?
[11808.65s -> 11820.82s]  Yeah. This loss seems very not fun. It's fun. It's just too much health. And I couldn't have.
[11821.62s -> 11825.30s]  I think we could both have much better weapons and accessories by now, but I've skipped so much
[11825.30s -> 11843.18s]  stuff. It's too much for my brain. I'm down close though. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, our potions
[11843.18s -> 11848.22s]  probably ran out. I didn't even realize. That takes forever. I usually take another one after
[11848.22s -> 11860.04s]  I spawn back. You want to give up right there? Is that the I give up in Terraria? I mean,
[11861.00s -> 11864.68s]  or we sit here and wait for all the NPCs to respawn and do something else?
[11865.32s -> 11873.80s]  Oh, they're all dead. No, they're all dead. That was our one chance to kill the god.
[11874.36s -> 11880.28s]  Here, let me get my main. Go get your main. Do it. Go get my main. Go get, okay, go get your like,
[11880.28s -> 11899.42s]  your decked out in full raid gear character. Are you actually going to do that? Yeah. I don't
[11899.42s -> 11904.14s]  remember the items I had. I'm like curious. I lost connection to you. Yes, I had to leave.
[11904.14s -> 11913.05s]  You killed the moon lord. So technically you did it. Yeah. No, it was fun. Yeah. So that
[11913.05s -> 11922.78s]  was the guy who beat Dark Souls on stream that devour of gods. Right. Is that is that like one
[11922.78s -> 11929.69s]  of the last boss two more after him. So there's two more bosses to end the whole thing. Yeah.
[11929.69s -> 11936.90s]  Damn. One of them is a there's one hard boss after that. That's a dragon yarn.
[11938.10s -> 11942.90s]  And then after that is like that. I have fuck you. You put this way that I'd like I didn't even
[11942.90s -> 11947.70s]  feel like crafting shit for. I was just like, I don't I'm not interested. That's cool, though.
[11947.70s -> 11950.90s]  There's a lot of content in this game. There's a lot of stuff to do.
[11956.10s -> 11959.22s]  Are you actually going to get your man or is that it? Yeah, the server is up.
[11960.42s -> 11978.49s]  I should be able just to join you, right? Yeah. I'm using this. Oh, this. Oh, true. Oh, yeah. This
[11978.49s -> 11987.21s]  was like crashing my computer because I had to replace my way when I had to replace my power
[11987.21s -> 11992.89s]  supply, I lowered an underclocked all my hardware and shooting this bow was bringing the server
[11992.89s -> 12002.23s]  down to like 10. Yes. Let me see. Where are you? That's you. All of those are homing arrows.
[12002.23s -> 12008.71s]  So like the game just kind of freaks out one up. Also, you can have. I know you can't use that.
[12011.35s -> 12015.19s]  Yeah, you can't use that. It's too intense for me.
[12020.81s -> 12032.94s]  Well, your character looks really cool. You ready? I guess we have. I don't have any potions.
[12032.94s -> 12037.34s]  We need them. Are you just going to know? I do have them because they're in my piggy bank
[12037.34s -> 12046.04s]  and it uses my potions from a piggy bank. I'm remembering. All right. So we're going to we're
[12046.04s -> 12049.56s]  going to go for it. You're going to kill everything in a second. No, it's still a
[12049.56s -> 12064.65s]  really hard boss. Oh, all right. But what are you writing? I thought that was a unicorn.
[12064.65s -> 12069.69s]  Is it a you? Oh, I'm a brony. I'm going to tell you that. Oh,
[12081.74s -> 12085.42s]  I'm ready. I'm going to get I'm going to get in sticky. I swear it's going to happen.
[12086.14s -> 12092.46s]  All right. Show off. Show off. Show off. Show off. Show off. Show off. I mean, I can't hold on.
[12096.58s -> 12101.42s]  Oh, this is hard. The game's hard. I knew it was going to happen.
[12112.47s -> 12118.10s]  Only seems to happen on this boss because it goes to the edge of the screen and you like follow it.
[12118.10s -> 12124.34s]  Remember when you said that this was hard? It is phase one. Well, you just killed that without even
[12124.98s -> 12148.84s]  I think slowing down a little. No, I'm good. I'm kind of waiting for the next health bar to go down.
[12148.84s -> 12171.35s]  OK, next part. All right. Here comes the destroyer of worlds, the eater of the gods.
[12173.11s -> 12197.98s]  Oh, that's all right. I'll just be tails. Now you're definitely lagging bad.
[12197.98s -> 12202.30s]  Yep. That it's it's when all these homing projectiles start going off at once,
[12202.30s -> 12204.38s]  it slows the game down and makes it easier to dodge.
[12206.36s -> 12209.48s]  It's helping a lot. Holy shit. There's so many arrows.
[12218.60s -> 12222.20s]  Also, you can see the arrows staying inside of them because there's like a hit delay on the boss.
[12222.92s -> 12225.24s]  So not all the arrows can hit him at the same time.
[12228.76s -> 12250.73s]  That's so stupid. OK, is this part? Well, it's easy to dodge when it's like slow mo, right?
[12250.73s -> 12254.25s]  No, I don't have slow mo, though. You don't know. That's just you.
[12255.69s -> 12274.36s]  I got a fucking beast of a computer. I'm going to die.
[12274.36s -> 12275.88s]  I'm not going to get to see the end of the movie.
[12281.62s -> 12286.34s]  Jerma has left. What? What do you mean have left?
[12286.34s -> 12288.90s]  I think I deced you. Oh, no.
[12294.52s -> 12297.64s]  I was going to see it. I was going to get to see the end.
[12298.60s -> 12303.16s]  Damn it. Are you still in there? Yeah.
[12306.52s -> 12311.16s]  Is it dead? It's like it's frozen.
[12311.88s -> 12316.01s]  Is it killable? I don't think so.
[12320.38s -> 12321.66s]  It crashed. Yeah.
[12322.62s -> 12326.47s]  Where is it? Where is it?
[12327.19s -> 12331.03s]  You press M and open up the map. You can see it.
[12331.67s -> 12335.10s]  This is not crashed. Its head's running around.
[12337.34s -> 12340.54s]  Well, kill its head. This is my chance.
[12341.34s -> 12343.26s]  I'll use the other bow.
[12361.10s -> 12364.86s]  Where is its head? Zoom your map out. You can see it moving around.
[12365.58s -> 12370.18s]  Oh, it's over there. It's dead.
[12370.26s -> 12372.78s]  Did it. Did it.
[12372.78s -> 12375.80s]  Where did it die? Right here.
[12376.52s -> 12377.72s]  Oh, and that sword's really good.
[12382.65s -> 12383.93s]  The power of the gods.
[12386.06s -> 12387.10s]  Excelsis.
[12388.84s -> 12393.40s]  I'll confirm to Jerma beat a Terraria except for the other bosses.
[12396.25s -> 12404.26s]  Whoa. I haven't been this happy.
[12405.16s -> 12407.48s]  Oh, yeah. And you can boost your melee damage a lot.
[12407.48s -> 12410.20s]  And that weapon is super good. All right. I'll keep it.
[12411.08s -> 12418.70s]  I have to have an asterisk because Star had to go on his big, cool character.
[12419.42s -> 12421.58s]  Wow. I just wanted to see what happened when you died.
[12422.46s -> 12426.10s]  Let's go over to the jungle real fast.
[12426.10s -> 12430.74s]  I beat the moon. Moon skeleton. I was there for that.
[12431.54s -> 12436.39s]  All right. Where are you? You're just flying around here.
[12436.39s -> 12438.87s]  Where are you? Going to the jungle.
[12438.87s -> 12440.87s]  Actually, the teleporter just takes it. I'm going to do that.
[12441.83s -> 12447.02s]  Jerma has joined the red party.
[12447.10s -> 12448.86s]  Does the jungle teleporter?
[12452.58s -> 12457.11s]  It's on my roof. Here, I need to.
[12464.06s -> 12466.46s]  Hey, I want to show you something real quick.
[12466.46s -> 12468.46s]  Show me something else cool.
[12480.94s -> 12481.82s]  That was kind of cool.
[12486.76s -> 12488.52s]  You can always teleport back to me.
[12488.52s -> 12494.28s]  I will. I won't yet.
[12504.82s -> 12511.77s]  Jungle dragon Yaron. He's killing me in one hit.
[12512.49s -> 12513.13s]  He does that.
[12516.31s -> 12518.23s]  One hit. You're up.
[12518.87s -> 12521.67s]  We need actual platforms in the jungle if I'm going to do it.
[12530.28s -> 12533.80s]  Are you just flexing right now? Are you just trying to beat this hard boss?
[12538.62s -> 12540.46s]  What else are we going to do? What do you want to do?
[12540.46s -> 12545.02s]  I'm just curious. I'm all right if you want to do a big mirror flex.
[12554.41s -> 12557.21s]  Ask Star to make a drill containment unit for me to play with.
[12560.02s -> 12562.87s]  I forget how to do that.
[12563.91s -> 12568.10s]  What was that?
[12569.30s -> 12573.06s]  I feel like that would be the Christmas present where you give the kid the present.
[12573.06s -> 12576.18s]  He's like, oh, this is so cool. And he plays with it for like a day
[12576.18s -> 12579.46s]  or like 10 minutes. And then you never see him play with it again.
[12580.66s -> 12583.86s]  Like, wow, you went through all this work and you made him the drill containment unit.
[12583.86s -> 12586.55s]  And that's all right, though.
[12586.55s -> 12588.55s]  Yeah. And do you have an axe?
[12589.35s -> 12590.31s]  Oh, a pickaxe.
[12590.31s -> 12595.90s]  Hold on. Oh, everyone's dead.
[12595.90s -> 12604.90s]  That's why I remember when like cutting down trees.
[12606.50s -> 12608.82s]  I do remember when cutting down trees.
[12611.06s -> 12612.82s]  You help make a platform.
[12613.86s -> 12615.90s]  We need a flat little.
[12617.98s -> 12622.86s]  My my friend, I have not carried around platforms in probably two streams.
[12622.86s -> 12625.82s]  Well, yeah. What can you like mine some stuff, daddy?
[12630.04s -> 12630.28s]  Sure.
[12640.94s -> 12642.62s]  All right. What do you need? You want platforms?
[12642.62s -> 12644.54s]  I got platforms like dirt.
[12644.54s -> 12646.46s]  And I just need like a flat surface.
[12647.10s -> 12652.79s]  So when there's a dragon making giant firewalls and you land like in a puddle,
[12652.79s -> 12653.83s]  you don't instantly die.
[12655.03s -> 12677.61s]  This guy can reach you.
[12678.50s -> 12678.90s]  What?
[12678.90s -> 12680.10s]  This looks like it would be you.
[12680.90s -> 12682.26s]  What would what would be me?
[12682.26s -> 12684.02s]  I don't know. Like a guy was walking over here.
[12685.14s -> 12686.74s]  I'm not a guy and I'm not walking over there.
[12686.74s -> 12688.66s]  I'm the guy on the my little pony.
[12688.66s -> 12702.14s]  I hate these things.
[12702.86s -> 12708.52s]  All right. So how much do you need?
[12708.52s -> 12709.32s]  How much space do you need?
[12711.77s -> 12712.97s]  Oh, this is probably good enough.
[12712.97s -> 12713.45s]  Is that all right?
[12714.41s -> 12716.84s]  Are you Brad?
[12717.48s -> 12721.21s]  No, I'm not Brad.
[12721.21s -> 12725.82s]  No, that's okay.
[12725.82s -> 12726.94s]  Three, two, one.
[12728.31s -> 12729.27s]  Three, two, one.
[12730.39s -> 12739.53s]  I wasn't ready.
[12740.25s -> 12741.45s]  God damn it, man.
[12741.45s -> 12744.41s]  I swear this fucking click out of the screen.
[12744.41s -> 12744.97s]  Bullshit.
[12747.46s -> 12749.38s]  Get on my nerves just a little.
[12750.90s -> 12752.50s]  I need to go into full screen mode.
[12753.46s -> 12757.91s]  Dude, I don't even know.
[12757.91s -> 12760.22s]  I'm just going to sit here.
[12761.82s -> 12764.04s]  I'm just going to watch your stream.
[12764.84s -> 12767.50s]  I don't even know where you guys are.
[12768.38s -> 12771.42s]  You're throwing swords at them.
[12773.42s -> 12775.66s]  You're doing all the work and I'm just like, I'm happy too.
[12775.66s -> 12778.54s]  I was lagging because last time I was doing this, it wasn't.
[12779.82s -> 12795.83s]  We also don't have a party.
[12795.83s -> 12796.95s]  So like, I don't even know where you are.
[12812.74s -> 12813.38s]  Damn it.
[12813.38s -> 12814.18s]  Oh, he just went.
[12814.18s -> 12815.54s]  He just killed us both in one go.
[12816.74s -> 12818.02s]  He just went through you and through me.
[12819.30s -> 12820.58s]  Laggy dash phase.
[12821.62s -> 12824.02s]  That was a laggy dash phase for sure.
[12827.86s -> 12829.14s]  He's such an annoying boss.
[12829.70s -> 12840.42s]  So where is he on the scale of Terraria bosses?
[12843.22s -> 12845.46s]  There's one harder than him, I guess,
[12845.46s -> 12847.38s]  which was Supreme Kalamitas after that.
[12848.66s -> 12851.72s]  Can we see it?
[12855.45s -> 12856.97s]  I never made the summon item for it.
[12857.77s -> 12874.73s]  Oh, and the item is also annoying to me.
[12874.73s -> 12875.61s]  That's why I made it.
[12876.25s -> 12877.61s]  Yeah, I don't feel like it.
[12877.61s -> 12879.05s]  Well, I'll just look at a screenshot of him.
[12879.05s -> 12880.65s]  Oh, and you need Yaren's soul fragments.
[12881.69s -> 12884.17s]  It is Supreme Kalamitas.
[12885.05s -> 12892.39s]  Supreme Kalamitas.
[12893.03s -> 12898.70s]  Okay.
[12899.58s -> 12901.02s]  That's it right there.
[12901.02s -> 12901.42s]  All right.
[12901.42s -> 12904.30s]  Is Terraria stealing other people's content live on stream right now?
[12904.30s -> 12904.86s]  What?
[12904.86s -> 12907.02s]  I'm looking at an image of...
[12907.02s -> 12908.46s]  I want to see what it looks like.
[12908.46s -> 12909.50s]  You know what I need to do.
[12909.50s -> 12910.54s]  What are you talking about?
[12910.54s -> 12912.62s]  I'm looking at like an image of the boss.
[12912.62s -> 12915.58s]  This bow won't lag because it doesn't home anymore.
[12916.54s -> 12922.71s]  So are you going for this again?
[12925.80s -> 12927.64s]  You got like a bone to pick here, huh?
[12928.28s -> 12946.58s]  Also, I'm not sure how much harder I'm making this on myself for being on a pony
[12946.58s -> 12949.78s]  and not having a dash for when he turns into instant kill dash phase.
[12961.72s -> 12963.72s]  Is it a certain health that he gets to that he doesn't?
[12974.63s -> 12983.46s]  I like the part where he goes...
[12983.46s -> 12988.34s]  ...and he like teleports back and forth while he moves forward.
[12988.98s -> 12990.74s]  Those are my favorite parts about this boss.
[12991.54s -> 12995.78s]  I'm holding a piece of fucking wood.
[13003.00s -> 13005.64s]  We're not sure if he's trying to go forward or backwards.
[13005.64s -> 13006.28s]  I love that.
[13006.28s -> 13009.08s]  I fucking clicked out of the goddamn window again.
[13009.08s -> 13010.44s]  Why do I keep doing this to myself?
[13012.20s -> 13017.70s]  All right.
[13017.70s -> 13018.18s]  Here we go.
[13030.90s -> 13031.38s]  Did he get you?
[13032.74s -> 13036.90s]  Yeah, I don't have like a Crimson whatever chaos.
[13036.90s -> 13038.90s]  I can't remember the name of the rod that teleports you.
[13040.26s -> 13040.90s]  German muted?
[13040.90s -> 13041.38s]  Yeah, of course.
[13042.84s -> 13044.12s]  Uh, I accidentally did.
[13045.00s -> 13048.04s]  Yeah, and I tried it when we and Ashley are playing.
[13048.04s -> 13052.36s]  If you kill the slime god on expert, he gives you the stupid potions
[13052.36s -> 13057.32s]  that like actually make you immune for six seconds that we just swore off using.
[13059.32s -> 13060.04s]  Rod of Discord.
[13060.04s -> 13062.84s]  Yeah, there's something in Calamity that Rod of Discord upgrades into
[13062.84s -> 13064.44s]  that is better for teleporting.
[13064.44s -> 13065.24s]  I can't remember what it is.
[13067.64s -> 13068.84s]  The Rod of Discord.
[13070.04s -> 13072.10s]  That's cool.
[13075.11s -> 13079.51s]  Oh, do I have the thingy?
[13082.47s -> 13084.39s]  Is that what we call Terraria?
[13084.39s -> 13088.15s]  We got to seal all the stuff except for the last final boss, but that's all right.
[13089.11s -> 13097.21s]  Well, actually also you kill that boss, you get him to 10% health and then he runs away
[13097.21s -> 13099.45s]  and then you have to better chase him down.
[13100.25s -> 13105.21s]  No, no, like he actually leaves at 10% and then he's like, haha, you'll never beat me later.
[13105.21s -> 13107.45s]  And you do it again later and he's different ish.
[13107.45s -> 13108.01s]  Oh shit.
[13109.45s -> 13111.77s]  So technically there's two more bosses.
[13111.77s -> 13115.53s]  Yeah, and then after you beat that, you restart the whole game and play it on Revengeance.
[13118.33s -> 13126.17s]  Which actually, I hope it didn't like delete an item.
[13131.83s -> 13138.46s]  Well, I was absolutely thrilled to follow along and enjoy Terraria.
[13143.61s -> 13145.21s]  Did they already beat Moon Lord?
[13146.41s -> 13146.65s]  Yeah.
[13147.45s -> 13156.78s]  Yeah, well, that's it.
[13156.78s -> 13158.22s]  I don't know if you have anything else planned for today.
[13158.22s -> 13163.18s]  I didn't even expect to stream that long and yet here we were four hours ish.
[13163.18s -> 13163.98s]  Yeah, no, that's good.
[13165.10s -> 13166.46s]  I'll probably just hang out for a little bit.
[13167.42s -> 13167.74s]  Okay.
[13167.74s -> 13172.22s]  Maybe I'll do some random stuff for like an hour or so.
[13172.22s -> 13175.18s]  But yeah, you ready?
[13175.18s -> 13175.98s]  You want to do the outro?
[13178.82s -> 13181.22s]  Hey everybody, it's me OnlyUseMeBlade.
[13181.22s -> 13183.30s]  Check me out on OnlyUseMeBlade on YouTube
[13185.62s -> 13187.86s]  and fake hair everywhere.
[13191.94s -> 13198.47s]  Well, I would say to follow me, which is Jerma.
[13199.19s -> 13200.31s]  Oh, follow Jerma.
[13203.10s -> 13203.66s]  Okay, bye.
[13205.99s -> 13210.63s]  Follow Star too because he streams and that's it.
[13210.63s -> 13211.11s]  It's Terraria.
[13211.11s -> 13215.74s]  Thanks for watching Terraria, Star.
[13216.46s -> 13216.94s]  He's gone.
[13216.94s -> 13220.54s]  I was going to say, Terraria is Saturdays.
[13221.64s -> 13222.44s]  What do we do?
[13223.40s -> 13224.44s]  There's no other video games.
[13225.40s -> 13225.88s]  Never mind.
[13226.68s -> 13227.16s]  I forgot.
[13227.16s -> 13229.24s]  There's like no other video games to play.
[13236.46s -> 13238.30s]  I'm just imagining that guy as his Twitch streamer.
[13238.86s -> 13240.78s]  Well, okay, guys, I did it.
[13240.78s -> 13246.46s]  It's 2028 and there's no more video games.
[13246.46s -> 13247.02s]  I did them all.
[13247.82s -> 13248.54s]  Thanks for watching.
[13249.10s -> 13252.57s]  We did every console.
[13252.57s -> 13253.85s]  I've played every PC game.
[13254.65s -> 13256.92s]  I'll see you when the next game releases.
[13258.18s -> 13259.78s]  Hopefully one comes out on Tuesday.
[13268.66s -> 13269.38s]  Family Feud.
[13272.06s -> 13276.54s]  Yeah, you know, I could load up the Xbox Family Feud.
[13276.54s -> 13277.34s]  Not Kinect though.
[13278.98s -> 13280.18s]  All right, I'm going to give you guys a choice.
[13280.90s -> 13282.10s]  It's going to be up to you.
[13283.61s -> 13287.53s]  Either just Xbox, just Family Feud, no Kinect.
[13287.53s -> 13289.69s]  Just play it and hang out for like an hour or two.
[13290.57s -> 13299.27s]  Or, or we can do Talk to Transformer or Tier Lists
[13300.15s -> 13300.95s]  while we just hang out.
[13303.51s -> 13306.47s]  Those of you that are just out of here
[13306.47s -> 13307.51s]  or you're like, all right, that was it.
[13307.51s -> 13308.15s]  I'll see you later.
[13308.71s -> 13313.56s]  The next stream will be on Tuesday.
[13315.37s -> 13317.37s]  So I'll be off for a couple days here.
[13318.01s -> 13319.22s]  I'll be live on Tuesday.
[13326.46s -> 13329.26s]  But let me get a poll in the chat and I'm going to go P.
[13330.06s -> 13332.02s]  Come back and see what you guys want to do.
[13332.02s -> 13332.42s]  Let's see.
[13337.24s -> 13339.48s]  Talk to Transformer Tier Lists or we'll do Family Feud.
[13344.10s -> 13345.06s]  Again, thanks to Star.
[13345.06s -> 13348.90s]  That was glad that he got to show me all those things.
[13350.14s -> 13351.58s]  Terraria is a really, really fun game.
[13352.82s -> 13354.34s]  Got a little overwhelmed throughout it,
[13354.34s -> 13355.54s]  but that happens.
[13355.54s -> 13356.82s]  It's a lot of info to take in.
[13357.46s -> 13358.26s]  But no, it's cool.
[13358.90s -> 13359.70s]  I enjoyed it.
[13359.70s -> 13362.42s]  Otherwise, why would I have wanted to stream it all the way through?
[13365.29s -> 13365.93s]  8.6.
[13367.16s -> 13367.48s]  All right.
[13370.65s -> 13371.21s]  Strawpoll.
[13372.97s -> 13385.54s]  Talk to Transformer Family Feud, Xbox or Tier Lists.
[13386.18s -> 13388.07s]  I'll be right back.
[13389.90s -> 13390.22s]  Vote.
[13393.67s -> 13395.19s]  And I will see you guys in a minute.
