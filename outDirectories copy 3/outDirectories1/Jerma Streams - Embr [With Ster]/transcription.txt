[191.87s -> 199.33s]  jade cocoon is it a ps1 I believe so okay it's actually an amazing game and it's like you like
[199.33s -> 204.77s]  breed your pokemon and like based on what two types you choose they like gain traits of each
[204.77s -> 211.74s]  other and they like visually look that way I'll try also everyone in the world dies oh well it's
[211.82s -> 217.60s]  dark souls of pokemon don't spoil it we haven't even played it well I'm just I like I don't want
[217.60s -> 223.33s]  to see you cry on stream it's a real tearjerker yeah but every time we've ever seen a movie
[223.33s -> 228.94s]  together it doesn't matter what it is I cry at like every other scene sir say it's like monster
[228.94s -> 234.48s]  rancher with better combat is that a selling point have you played monster rancher I used to
[234.48s -> 239.36s]  play a ton of it okay I was gonna I was gonna reverse recommend you monster rancher if you
[239.36s -> 244.45s]  never played it no when I was a wee lad when like monster rancher 2 was new I remember going around
[244.45s -> 249.49s]  the house and like finding all the aol discs to try and get a good a good monster a good mon
[249.49s -> 255.65s]  but it's always the wolf yeah that that first scene and up I have to take a day off before
[255.65s -> 259.65s]  I come back to the movie I cry for about six hours and then the next day I can watch the
[259.65s -> 264.88s]  rest of the movie and I make sure that I don't watch that part I watch it from that part forward
[264.88s -> 270.42s]  okay so like close your eyes for like some parts of jade cocoon okay and like don't listen to the
[270.42s -> 280.03s]  soundtrack because it's like good and you'll like cry okay so you've done the tutorial yeah I
[280.03s -> 283.63s]  it seems like it's pretty easy to get in a game you just do like a join code and a password with
[283.63s -> 292.27s]  a private match and I I did kind of speed run the tutorial but it did take me about five minutes
[292.27s -> 301.52s]  and some change okay I'm very quick I'm gonna I'm gonna zoom yeah if I did it in five minutes
[301.52s -> 313.70s]  you could probably do it in three remember why do you sound like you're acting isn't he always
[313.70s -> 321.71s]  dude why do you sound like you're acting again what do you mean oh I have to say again no it's
[321.71s -> 326.67s]  the intro sir do you still do the intro voice kind of even even though it's been like more
[326.67s -> 334.37s]  than a decade the intro what is going on guys hey guys grimro here with another farming strategy
[334.37s -> 340.05s]  no no like yo guys what is up dude how do you start your stream like when you turn your stream
[340.05s -> 345.58s]  on are you like hey what's up what's up what's up have you done um I don't know I don't start
[345.58s -> 350.06s]  my stream very often it's a hard question to answer yeah but then you like kind of get over
[350.06s -> 355.52s]  it after like five minutes it's like okay this stream just turned on all right are you nervous
[355.52s -> 360.75s]  are you nervous right now I mean I didn't mean this legendary star is the call with me
[361.55s -> 371.09s]  you mean come on I didn't pay attention to hold on okay no I'm good I'm doing the tutorial it's
[371.09s -> 381.78s]  you know they're like throwing puzzles at me it's so easy he's acting like he's not acting
[389.25s -> 395.62s]  time zones are wild hey stars do you know that there is a spot on earth where it is
[396.62s -> 402.11s]  over the course of three days there's there there's a time zone where there is like it could be
[402.11s -> 409.95s]  January 5th 6th and 7th because of how the time zone works that's kind of messed up yeah did you
[409.95s -> 416.22s]  know that I I mean I didn't know that I did so I mean that was that's something that you know that
[416.22s -> 432.75s]  I did not know some knowledge to drop on you everyone's yelling at me you know oh you're not
[432.75s -> 448.94s]  smart I never said I was smart I just said I was dropping knowledge doesn't smart imply that I kind
[448.94s -> 455.23s]  of came up with that concept I watched somebody talk about it and then I did I forwarded the email
[455.23s -> 472.34s]  to stir is knowledge smartness I mean I guess it is yeah being able to deduce things I think I have
[472.34s -> 480.24s]  I have a general feeling that I'm going to be very bad at this game why because I'm in the tutorial
[480.24s -> 490.34s]  and I'm like really confused wait how the confusion per minute is too high for a tutorial
[491.07s -> 494.67s]  how wait you can no you're not confused about this you just have to like
[494.67s -> 499.07s]  break windows and put out the fires and run through the and turn off the electrical outlets
[499.71s -> 505.95s]  I've never been in a fire before when he said is knowledge smartness omega low
[505.95s -> 524.61s]  can you please be quiet I'm watching stir right now um I think I think I did it you know got us
[524.61s -> 532.83s]  both up in a fucking too modest scenario I believe I'm ready all right so I'm not ready I gotta do the
[532.83s -> 538.19s]  shop I gotta get my tools and upgrades I gotta buy my ladders it takes two seconds you'd be
[538.19s -> 547.47s]  ready in a minute okay now I'm ready are you making the game um I I could if you wanted me
[547.47s -> 556.11s]  to I think it's just yeah yeah you host I need a let's see so yeah yeah okay so let me see
[556.83s -> 584.32s]  okay I need a decent password see do I even need to okay does that work can you join me
[585.52s -> 589.52s]  I definitely don't want to show this on stream is this like a join code that's
[590.16s -> 597.34s]  just pasted at the top of the screen um I don't know okay I can type it to you hold on
[598.46s -> 602.46s]  there's a join code and a password did you set a password that's the password
[603.26s -> 612.80s]  and the join join code is this that is the join code hopefully when you do this I can just it
[612.80s -> 619.81s]  doesn't stay on the screen what's the Nintendo buddy code I think you may did you just join
[620.45s -> 630.56s]  yeah okay uh how do I get the join code off the screen all right what job do you want to
[630.56s -> 635.90s]  do you um imagine we're just gonna do this first one I don't I don't know where you are I don't
[635.90s -> 641.63s]  know what you're looking at do it easy or hard get as many clients out of the building as possible
[641.63s -> 649.04s]  it's just like a house stop spraying me I can't show the screen guys you guys are gonna get into
[649.04s -> 658.75s]  the game cover it with like your arm how do is there like can I do it in the settings

[1207.25s -> 1213.84s]  make like a hole somewhere right a hole because we can probably throw this stuff out a window
[1214.93s -> 1218.69s]  yeah okay right here so get stuff over here and then we'll throw it out the window this way
[1219.33s -> 1227.10s]  so find everything valuable and throw it out the window uh are the random things actually worth
[1227.10s -> 1234.38s]  money yeah I have 14.99 yeah like vases I found like an actual stack of money I thought that was
[1234.38s -> 1251.89s]  the only thing I've got Hamtaro it's too heavy oh holy you throw far you throw a bit too far

[1276.86s -> 1288.43s]  thinking all individually this is two dollars why would we save a like bottle of oil that cardboard
[1288.43s -> 1294.43s]  box make sure you save it that's why I love that one well inside that box is the family tree
[1299.58s -> 1305.98s]  people are screaming at us they're saying dude fight the fire no this whole room is like collapsing
[1305.98s -> 1315.95s]  actually this was a washing machine can we both pick it up I can't get it maybe you need like
[1315.95s -> 1323.06s]  equipment to pick up heavy stuff or something oh these explosive barrels are worth 30 bucks
[1323.94s -> 1332.82s]  I don't think we should have done that why did it blow up what did you do I don't think we rescued
[1332.82s -> 1344.99s]  two people I think we rescued one person what is this oh all right we should probably end it
[1344.99s -> 1353.14s]  can we just end it yeah let's go I like the mix of is this not where we go I don't know over here
[1355.26s -> 1363.01s]  I like the mix of being a firefighter and also like a criminal three stars that's not bad yes
[1363.01s -> 1373.70s]  that's pretty good so how much was the bonus cash for who knows job payout nine that's pretty good
[1373.70s -> 1382.10s]  anyway there were five people here oh you press next it gives you the the rundown saved items
[1382.10s -> 1391.34s]  how are there three of the people wait I thought it said five out of five I thought we had two
[1391.34s -> 1401.12s]  out of two people to rescue three of them died well well we still got a pretty good tip all
[1401.12s -> 1405.68s]  things considered that was like a 50% tip all right we just opened up a bunch of new stuff
[1409.15s -> 1415.71s]  we got this place here which is a rescue mission salvage we need low house damage
[1416.51s -> 1426.11s]  uh this place uh utica av seems like this uh it's pretty low on the danger
[1426.75s -> 1433.73s]  you want to do the higher danger or do you want to do the lower danger uh whatever I mean we're
[1433.73s -> 1439.90s]  gonna let them all die anyway okay so let's do this so they're okay I think there are six people
[1439.90s -> 1448.78s]  here did you unlock new stuff to use oh wait maybe we can buy some stuff maybe go to the shop
[1449.34s -> 1453.63s]  tools and upgrades oh okay this stuff here we don't have enough to do it though
[1458.37s -> 1462.13s]  you have a ladder right yeah oh yeah you can buy like new nozzles for your uh your thing

[2267.07s -> 2277.28s]  rare this is a medium rare mission I think we need to this mission we need to spend some time

[2298.02s -> 2303.46s]  fucking up the whole the stocks and that's funny but like that's that's negatively impacting my
[2303.46s -> 2309.38s]  stream there there is a deployable toilet which will make the people who have to pee
[2309.38s -> 2316.38s]  go to that toilet so you could put it outside and they'll come to the toilet we cannot use
[2316.38s -> 2324.75s]  light firefighters might have 85 percent of the North American market but you best not
[2324.75s -> 2330.19s]  forget about your Canadian competition at poser and crazy I'm gonna throw this fucking box at
[2330.19s -> 2340.35s]  him this construction site okay so what do we do uh oh make a trail from the electricity to us

[3497.44s -> 3527.41s]  reprimanding them where are you I'm on the roof because apparently there's one more okay we got
[3527.41s -> 3561.20s]  all the toxic barrels we got to burn the building we almost got this almost what all right we did it
[3561.28s -> 3572.96s]  it would do all we did it nice got it that was interesting it's like a you it's like a reverse
[3577.47s -> 3594.13s]  yeah that's like a reverse we only have one second to do that close uh yeah I was putting out every
[3594.13s -> 3601.65s]  single thing you were doing by the way I was fighting so hard to put to like to fix everything
[3601.65s -> 3610.10s]  that you were doing you're you're doing you're being me we cut it out we flipped I think we
[3610.10s -> 3619.38s]  flipped here I picked a game that normally you would play and you're being me all right let's
[3619.38s -> 3624.10s]  actually do this one this one seems pretty hard this is like a barrel factory let's do it
[3625.46s -> 3628.74s]  all right this game's I'm not I promise I'm having a good time I'm just messing around
[3628.74s -> 3649.34s]  you played the uno reverse card um I'm on edge dude I'm on edge oh it's an escape mission
[3649.34s -> 3655.18s]  I don't like these oh hello again we got your personal information off the ember database
[3655.18s -> 3659.34s]  it was pretty easy to hack into you've been making quite the kerfuffle for us
[3659.34s -> 3663.98s]  of the closer headquarters we had our government buy out this oil barrel factory
[3663.98s -> 3668.22s]  when we get you out of our toks we're gonna use this place to store 100%
[3669.90s -> 3680.16s]  during those classic videos now just stir is bad you're mad oh fuck all right how do we actually
[3680.16s -> 3685.73s]  get out of here wait what are we doing we have to we have to just get out I'd much prefer to have
[3685.73s -> 3690.05s]  you work at closer than go through all this trouble careful what your non-compete clause clearly
[3690.05s -> 3695.09s]  states ember responders are barred from working for any app-based firefighting companies or
[3695.09s -> 3701.25s]  Canadian corporations yeah I still think that would be so fun and funny to do to do the social
[3701.25s -> 3710.93s]  like the stir in germa video remastered series it it would we just we pick a video and we just
[3710.93s -> 3716.53s]  try to redo the whole video but like without watching it and then one of us makes the video
[3716.53s -> 3721.49s]  when we premiere and we watch it on screen and like how close did we come to the original
[3722.29s -> 3731.94s]  what was the name of that game that we were gonna do I think it was damn nation yeah I don't know
[3731.94s -> 3734.82s]  that game probably isn't even the server is probably I don't know if you can even play that
[3734.82s -> 3740.02s]  anymore to operate here instead of ember well why not our socialized after a long time 15
[3740.10s -> 3744.74s]  Canadian dollar per hour minimum wage and free K through 12 schooling for your kids

[5223.73s -> 5237.07s]  mathematical equations when I need to that sounds pretty good to me okay so I think we just unlocked
[5237.07s -> 5246.10s]  a new zone we did oh not quite yeah so there's a new zone but I like the sound of that
[5247.14s -> 5253.70s]  like new zones you want to do some new zones oh the the clothing actually has stats on it
[5254.34s -> 5260.62s]  really yeah like this helmet has reduced shock damage taken so wait I just bought oh this is

[5284.26s -> 5289.70s]  fun I mean we're just we're just it's just a little bit of he took that comment personally
[5292.56s -> 5306.69s]  and negatively it was a very positive comment and it like hurt you no it didn't I was just straight
[5306.69s -> 5319.47s]  I was just saying do the turtle where is the turtle head turtle mask thing where in the middle
[5324.50s -> 5340.50s]  oh you're talking about me okay never mind these clothes are expensive yeah they're very uh they're
[5340.50s -> 5360.82s]  helpful I'm ready when you are dead so what's your uh what's your game of the year for 2023 so far
[5360.82s -> 5369.02s]  vampire survivors I came out last year oh oh I misunderstood the question um I haven't played
[5369.02s -> 5373.63s]  anything this year you actually want to do the thing from last year so what was your game of
[5373.63s -> 5382.75s]  the year from last year um shoot I wrote something on on the twitter I forget I have like a I really
[5382.75s -> 5389.71s]  like a brain problem slice and dice you played slice and dice slice and dice yeah is that a
[5390.35s -> 5393.95s]  I think I've heard of it I think I was gonna play it eventually is that the a game that's on um
[5394.67s -> 5402.54s]  is that itch yo yeah yep and I think it's on like android I actually have had that since
[5403.26s -> 5412.66s]  that itch yo night from like a year ago it's very good but you have to like think so I don't know
[5412.66s -> 5425.10s]  if you'd be into it I mean I did you like vampire survivors I okay this is a very stir story so I uh
[5426.06s -> 5430.30s]  I I don't I got vampire survivors like this is kind of cool but I feel like the whole thing is
[5430.30s -> 5436.08s]  just like you don't actually do anything you can just stand still kind of that's so I got cheat
[5436.08s -> 5440.56s]  engine to give me all of the unlocks and then I did a run and then I stood still and realized
[5440.56s -> 5445.95s]  that you could beat it while standing still and was like okay I think I'm done wait hold on a
[5445.95s -> 5453.23s]  minute you we're not playing the mission yet because I'm gonna okay but but but but but but
[5453.23s -> 5457.07s]  have you played like any of the others like soul stone survivors you like you actually like move
[5457.07s -> 5466.27s]  in that game and dodge attacks you have this so wrong you cheated after the first time you played
[5466.27s -> 5472.75s]  it you're supposed to unlock stuff and slowly get more and more powerful the whole game is just like
[5472.75s -> 5476.91s]  like there's no skill expression you know what I'm saying like you don't get to just like
[5478.61s -> 5482.77s]  if what you do doesn't matter if you have the upgrades then it's not exciting to me because
[5482.77s -> 5488.21s]  you're just you're not doing anything like you you are gated by what the game has given you like
[5488.21s -> 5494.88s]  you're predetermined to have lost it's like you're playing the binding of Isaac but your tears don't
[5494.88s -> 5499.60s]  do damage but if you don't like I hate it Hades dude everyone in chat's gonna think I'm crazy
[5499.60s -> 5505.52s]  but Hades was just like if you want to deal plus 300% you're unmuted aren't I no no I'm
[5505.52s -> 5511.20s]  just letting you go if you want to deal 300% more damage then you have to die x amount of times
[5512.58s -> 5518.98s]  so you want the game to just when you turn it on just to go like I like just give you everything
[5518.98s -> 5525.14s]  no I like roguelikes where it's not about how much stuff you have unlocked it's about
[5525.22s -> 5532.53s]  how well you're playing yeah you can I correct me if I'm wrong here but I think you could beat
[5532.53s -> 5539.47s]  Hades on your first try if you were good enough do it then it's the same the same thing people
[5539.47s -> 5544.83s]  told me about loop hero oh yo the speed runners beat loop hero on their second run when they know
[5544.83s -> 5549.31s]  all of the optimal strats and have been playing the game for hundreds of hours so like it's not
[5549.31s -> 5554.67s]  it's not about hours of progression that they force you to do because you could beat it in four
[5554.67s -> 5560.19s]  hours if you actually like did like the reddit strategy stir people are dying in this building
[5560.83s -> 5565.23s]  you're the one that said let's take a minute and talk about this like you're in like a burning
[5565.23s -> 5569.87s]  building there's people arguing about vampire survivor the firefighters are arguing about
[5569.87s -> 5575.71s]  roguelikes in the have you played rotato I have it's like the same thing as vampire survivors
[5577.23s -> 5581.23s]  but like like like you actually get to dodge abilities and it's like quicker I like that a
[5581.23s -> 5592.58s]  lot more explosion um so you don't like when a game trickles you content after playing it for
[5592.58s -> 5600.10s]  a while I don't like when your chance of success is gated by how much time you've played and solely
[5600.10s -> 5606.32s]  how much time you've played well I mean what that so but you probably feel the same way about an
[5606.32s -> 5610.40s]  mmo then like mmos you got to play a lot to get anything from it would you ever play like an
[5610.48s -> 5615.36s]  I mean I don't really like mmos you know you know I play like path of exile in diablo like I like
[5615.36s -> 5621.12s]  grinding games right so what about diablo in diablo you start as a little shitty and you
[5621.12s -> 5626.16s]  give you a stick and it takes you hours and hours to level up and put skill points in
[5627.20s -> 5631.28s]  but you're still like doing an individual character build and it's like your journey
[5631.28s -> 5637.36s]  through and what items you find vampire survivors is there is you will eventually have 100 of these
[5637.36s -> 5644.93s]  things you know you can't equip every single item in all of diablo 2 all at once and be like
[5644.93s -> 5651.17s]  okay I wouldn't know the fun of vampire survivors is why you kind of roll dice to see what the game
[5651.17s -> 5657.97s]  is gonna let you choose from really oh really that's what it does it's like oh what am I gonna it's
[5657.97s -> 5664.21s]  an open box it's like what am I gonna get but then you unlock like rerolls yeah you get to choose
[5664.21s -> 5668.69s]  exactly the same things that you want every single run I am not going to tell you that there's no
[5668.69s -> 5675.81s]  power creep in vampire survivors there is I'm but I it's it's all right dollars I like it
[5677.18s -> 5681.42s]  but I think there's better alternatives at this point for it to be your game of the year is
[5681.42s -> 5686.22s]  is honestly name me something better start up what else I said bro I think bro tato is very similar
[5687.34s -> 5694.29s]  and I think it does it's it's better I don't think so what do you not like about bro tato I just
[5695.01s -> 5698.93s]  I just like I like vampire survivors more I think vampire survivors
[5699.49s -> 5704.61s]  has I like because abilities you like when you open the chest and it's like a casino and you
[5704.61s -> 5712.45s]  can hear all the noises yeah you know what yeah I like the kind of hey the game is going to throw
[5712.45s -> 5716.77s]  you some stuff what do you want to do and you got to make a decision and it gets stronger and
[5716.77s -> 5723.81s]  stronger I know but like I don't I it's not the same it's not the same it's the loot box noises
[5723.81s -> 5729.09s]  it's not the same there's something about this different I tried what was it soul survivors
[5729.09s -> 5734.26s]  one of the soul stone survivors yeah survivors I think I streamed that game and I was just like
[5734.26s -> 5741.23s]  it was like too it's it's like identical it was too much too quickly I don't like having all the
[5741.23s -> 5746.43s]  extremely powerful unlockables immediately I like to grow in power they there's tons of stuff you
[5746.43s -> 5755.81s]  can grow in power in that game it's too much it was too it's too much I honestly rare germa l rare
[5755.81s -> 5764.64s]  stir l oh stir wins what you're gonna have to put up a poll who wins this argument who all right
[5764.64s -> 5769.60s]  put a poll on who's the winner who wins the argument here I'll do it what do you mean you
[5769.60s -> 5776.08s]  don't have mod in my channel why wouldn't I I don't why don't I have mod in your channel I
[5776.08s -> 5786.10s]  removed like everybody okay what did I do what did I do that you were scared that like this
[5786.10s -> 5792.02s]  fucking psycho if you like to start banning people that you don't trust me but I I D wanted
[5792.02s -> 5800.00s]  like a dozen dozens of people and by the way you don't have VIP either I am aware that I see that
[5800.00s -> 5805.36s]  now you want to know what I do have I have a bit badge because uh you know I've given you some money
[5805.36s -> 5814.08s]  on your channel hey dude this looks pretty close but I think uh 54 to 46 all right now do it on
[5814.08s -> 5818.96s]  your channel and see if it's 54 46 in favorite view for streamer advantage someone actually did
[5818.96s -> 5830.40s]  do it on my channel I am at 78 78 yes yes yeah who wins stir 80 percent right now vampire survivors
[5830.40s -> 5836.48s]  got really popular and then here come all the haters here they come oh it's too I don't like
[5836.48s -> 5844.30s]  it I actually don't like it I hate it you just hate her I don't hate it I think there's better
[5844.30s -> 5850.80s]  alternatives when you're saying it's your game of the year what else did I say was my game of
[5850.80s -> 5856.98s]  the year that's all you've said so far to me I don't know anything else we've talked about it
[5856.98s -> 5866.74s]  before like in the chat I mean Elden Ring is Elden Ring oh no he chose vampire survivors over Elden
[5866.74s -> 5873.94s]  Ring and God of War you play God of War no I didn't play God of War well you don't have to
[5873.94s -> 5877.94s]  because vampire survivors was actually the best game last year Elden Ring was the best game that
[5877.94s -> 5883.54s]  came out last year but vampire survivors was like different and like indie and you like that you
[5883.54s -> 5889.22s]  like that stuff so I was like hey vampire survivors and then you just kind of you just like stomped
[5889.22s -> 5893.46s]  all over my sandcastle I thought we were going to have an agreement a friend time and all of a
[5893.46s -> 5901.46s]  sudden I'm wrong it's all progression no thought I need something I need something to interact
[5901.46s -> 5906.80s]  with I need like a button I can press every once in a while yeah but isn't it fun just to kind of
[5906.80s -> 5914.88s]  sit on the toilet and just do that it's like awesome when I sit on the toilet I shit that's
[5914.88s -> 5922.85s]  all I do you ever just take a moment out of your life where you don't have to be like on a device
[5930.34s -> 5934.42s]  wait you mean to tell me you just you go to the bathroom when you go to the bathroom what kind of
[5934.42s -> 5938.82s]  weirdo is this Ashley's the same way she can't go to the bathroom unless she like has her phone
[5938.82s -> 5945.06s]  and can read articles yeah because it's it's you know what it is dude if I could do that in the
[5945.06s -> 5950.22s]  shower I would if I could have like a thing where I could just be in the shower and like playing
[5950.22s -> 5954.14s]  like a game or something hanging out this reminds me of a story of someone who was a professional
[5954.14s -> 5958.62s]  clash of clans addict and they were like had like 10 accounts and they would like zip lock their
[5958.62s -> 5963.34s]  phone and play it in the shower you're so you're not on that level no because you could you could
[5963.34s -> 5968.46s]  zip lock your your phone no but that's I don't know that's weird I don't like that material feels
[5968.46s -> 5977.82s]  weird um okay the main problem is when you're that's like a very private enclosed space nobody
[5977.82s -> 5983.90s]  else it's just you get to be in there and it's super it's just you and you're just hanging out
[5983.90s -> 5989.42s]  in there and it's a super private little spot I it feels good to kind of like oh I'm in the bathroom
[5989.42s -> 5992.78s]  just like taking it you know what I mean like there's a lot of that is that because if you
[5992.78s -> 5997.26s]  weren't in the bathroom you would be like oh I need to be busy like I'm wasting time like I
[5997.26s -> 6001.98s]  got to be productive but in the bathroom it's like no it's acceptable because I need to poop
[6001.98s -> 6006.70s]  but you're taking extra time pooping you know playing vampire survivors when you could actually
[6006.70s -> 6010.78s]  just like judge yourself a little less and like go do it out in nature like out in nature you know
[6010.78s -> 6017.58s]  take a hike but when you are in the bathroom there are no worldly expectations of you like you said
[6017.58s -> 6022.30s]  well that's what I'm saying you need to like that's that's an issue that's a problem even dude even
[6022.86s -> 6028.22s]  even oh well what about like lying in bed dude you could be like you could be no there's like
[6028.22s -> 6034.78s]  a worldly expectation the only worldly expectation you have when you are in the bathroom is nope
[6034.78s -> 6039.42s]  private private this is you are you are shut off for at least however long you're in there
[6042.94s -> 6048.51s]  this is what you guys are getting that's rough that's rough man like dude because like if your
[6048.51s -> 6055.23s]  alarm goes off when you're asleep oh I gotta get up right there is no like your alarm doesn't go
[6055.23s -> 6060.19s]  off like when you're in the bathroom it's not like oh shit I gotta get off the toilet now it's but
[6060.19s -> 6064.99s]  yeah I gotta I got some I got some stuff no no you are in there what if you're late to go do
[6064.99s -> 6068.75s]  something and you tell them like I was late because like I had to go to the bathroom is that like
[6068.75s -> 6072.35s]  always acceptable if someone shows up or like doesn't give something to you on time and it's
[6072.35s -> 6077.71s]  like I was in the bathroom always oh sorry sorry I had to use the bathroom oh how dare you have to
[6077.71s -> 6082.75s]  go to the bathroom no no that you absolutely what if they're in the bathroom for two hours
[6082.91s -> 6089.15s]  what if like you're on set filming one of your like big big dramas like a stick of baseball up his
[6089.15s -> 6092.67s]  ass and like one of like the guy who's gonna stick it in your ass is in the bathroom for two
[6092.67s -> 6109.98s]  hours and holds everything up I don't know I'd be like you you the bathroom is a complete and
[6109.98s -> 6115.18s]  total fucking sanctuary if you well I don't know what if they're sick what if it's like I yeah I'm
[6115.18s -> 6122.48s]  sorry but like we have to do it's like okay I understand I I guess like oh sorry a bit but and
[6123.12s -> 6127.76s]  okay but if I disagree though completely again because like I would shit myself to win in a
[6127.76s -> 6132.24s]  quick play match in overwatch I would not let you down if I was on set so I would shit myself on
[6132.24s -> 6138.40s]  camera for you but you hold on so what was the last time that you took like anything into like
[6138.40s -> 6144.08s]  a newspaper or I have never in my life ever done that so what you just go in there sit down and
[6144.08s -> 6150.96s]  just like go and then get up is it like so painful to be alone with your thoughts no I'm telling you
[6150.96s -> 6156.08s]  I like being alone with my thoughts so I like that private time in the bathroom are you alone
[6156.08s -> 6160.32s]  with your thoughts if you're on vampire survivors or are you distracting yourself from your thoughts
[6160.32s -> 6164.40s]  no no I can just kind of sit there and just like all right let's go I can like hang out
[6165.12s -> 6169.86s]  and sometimes dude at the end of a vampire survivors run in the bathroom I pause it for
[6169.86s -> 6175.70s]  a second and just contemplate when you sit on the toilet do you like today do you cross your legs
[6175.70s -> 6182.34s]  like and meditate like that you are talking like style on the toilet dude I drink espresso
[6182.34s -> 6191.82s]  when I take a shit sometimes you are talking to the wrong person what makes that wrong why why
[6191.82s -> 6198.70s]  why are you the wrong person because I love my bathroom time and like I take baths I sip on
[6198.70s -> 6205.34s]  espresso while I shit okay I play vampire survivors I get my switch again to recap just to boil this
[6205.34s -> 6210.54s]  all down real quick for anyone who's confused vampire survivors is the game of the year because
[6210.54s -> 6222.27s]  you can't play elden ring on the toilet yeah all right okay just to tie a knot on that real quick
[6223.58s -> 6235.30s]  we killed another group of people by the way well that's too bad hey we can do it
[6236.02s -> 6239.86s]  yeah we got time uh but no elden ring was game did you you went through the whole thing right
[6240.58s -> 6248.80s]  yeah orphan a cough and all that so stir dark souls 2 is like the best dark souls
[6249.52s -> 6255.04s]  stir underscore right you what how do you feel about that I mean that that was years ago that
[6255.04s -> 6260.72s]  I would have said that okay I am a controversial dark souls 2 enjoyer and my reason always was
[6260.72s -> 6266.40s]  that because it had a lot of content and elden ring has a lot of content so I'm gonna have you
[6266.40s -> 6271.84s]  know elden rings is the tops so you think it's the best that they've made for sure do you think
[6271.84s -> 6279.55s]  it's better than uh bloodborne oh I forgot no no you don't think so no I really takes it would
[6279.55s -> 6286.37s]  take a masterpiece like an absolute above and beyond to be bloodborne for me I think a lot of
[6286.37s -> 6292.03s]  that is just the aesthetic in the world like if elden ring was the bloodborne setting but that
[6292.03s -> 6297.94s]  setting does a lot for me that's actually true if bloodborne was elden rings the kind of world the
[6297.94s -> 6305.68s]  size and the scope yeah but the problem with bloodborne is because it was 10 years ago now
[6305.68s -> 6314.05s]  right that's something like that it's been a while it's hard to say that oh elden rings better when
[6314.86s -> 6319.92s]  if you think about at the time that was just so unbelievable when it came out but like elden ring
[6319.92s -> 6325.84s]  was so unbelievable when it came out like dude I have not had that a lot of articles would argue
[6325.84s -> 6330.64s]  with you about how unbelievable elden ring was on pc when it came out yeah but I know they were
[6330.64s -> 6336.08s]  like the stuttering whatever I we everybody dealt with that the first week right that's
[6336.08s -> 6341.54s]  just gonna happen that's blocked out of my memory that just happens but whatever it's a new release
[6341.54s -> 6349.30s]  I know it was annoying uh but that first when you first opened up the map of elden ring and you
[6349.30s -> 6356.10s]  realized that it wasn't just limb grave oh wow cool this is a big map it's kind of like a wow
[6356.10s -> 6360.98s]  it's like as big as gta3 oh this is cool and you're in the back of your mind you're going oh cool
[6360.98s -> 6366.21s]  all right yeah I wish it was bigger I wish it was a little bigger yeah then you go down the elevator
[6366.21s -> 6370.93s]  and there's then the underground world yes and it and then it blows your mind just how big the
[6370.93s -> 6378.56s]  game actually is yeah it was a great game I don't think something will come out and now you play no
[6378.56s -> 6382.40s]  dude play god of war I don't think it would even come close to me it wouldn't even come close I
[6382.40s -> 6388.14s]  don't think the elden ring for me I played god of war of the but uh it's god of war one but it's
[6388.14s -> 6395.25s]  not it's like the new god of war from like 2016 whatever it was yeah um I played the first like
[6395.25s -> 6401.09s]  five to six hours of it and it was phenomenal it was phenomenal but I don't I don't know I
[6401.09s -> 6406.53s]  feel like I still I don't know I I hear let me tell you let me hear what listen to me
[6407.17s -> 6412.93s]  yeah I'm listening to you so I have my full attention god of war I was told stand out in

[6714.48s -> 6718.64s]  quarter or first half of the game whatever it was it was awesome and it just like I couldn't it just

[6838.48s -> 6843.92s]  to be clear it doesn't have to be a device it should be the back of a shampoo bottle
[6846.72s -> 6860.74s]  you're you're sitting on the toilet reading a shampoo bottle it depends I don't know why
[6861.73s -> 6869.47s]  just I don't know just because it's like just something to do I don't know you you don't think
[6869.63s -> 6877.73s]  I feel like it's kind of weird um I feel weird just sitting there what are you distracting
[6877.73s -> 6884.77s]  yourself from I just feel weird just sitting there I'm dead again hold on I'm going the floor
[6885.81s -> 6896.48s]  fell apart where where can you ping no ping restart the mission we have three people
[6896.48s -> 6907.39s]  rescued no restart the mission no restart okay no we're gonna win you just you're doing the stir
[6907.39s -> 6911.71s]  thing where you're gonna now find the optimal route you're gonna find everything you can get
[6911.71s -> 6918.74s]  everybody in like 10 seconds we have to rescue six people the building's burning I'm dead do you
[6918.74s -> 6933.89s]  have any of the key fobs to even get into the room that I'm in ow you're distracting me with
[6933.89s -> 6943.76s]  all of this reading shampoo bottles while pooping commentary okay see like this is the tutorial you
[6943.76s -> 6951.70s]  just pick this up you see the key oh yeah all right see that's why we restarted because
[6951.70s -> 6957.30s]  that seems very important to figure out and not go all there's all these key cards right here I
[6957.30s -> 6962.74s]  thought these were tennis rackets I thought that they were like like when the choo-choo train has
[6962.74s -> 6967.14s]  to change tracks and there's the thing in the ground and it goes left and right and that the
[6967.14s -> 6971.86s]  train would come through the door I thought these were frying pans tennis rackets I did not know
[6971.94s -> 6981.62s]  that's what this was all right I get it I get it let's go and there's red ones in there if you
[6981.62s -> 6986.26s]  weren't like interrupting this mission with all of your like oh like oh I'm gonna make like a crazy
[6986.26s -> 6998.05s]  take hey type stuff stupid stupid I just opened both doors okay good job stupid we need a blue
[6998.05s -> 7008.88s]  key all right there is nobody up they're all kind of this one little floor up here and that's it
[7009.60s -> 7017.78s]  you're actually lying not we need green look here last time we need green key yellow key
[7018.66s -> 7035.06s]  okay so what is your what besides elven ring and vampire survivors which we already kind of
[7035.06s -> 7042.94s]  concluded but what would you say are your top three games last year uh slice and dice and
[7042.94s -> 7048.93s]  gotta work oh so you did play gotta work I had watched someone play it which was enough for me
[7048.93s -> 7054.93s]  to say that that's a really good game I don't have a PlayStation 5 they actually don't exist
[7056.70s -> 7061.10s]  but I I would have played it so you are vicariously giving game of the year through
[7061.10s -> 7069.15s]  someone else ah yep okay uh because if I'm not allowed to do that then like the whole
[7069.15s -> 7074.67s]  industry of like having analysts and uh you know consultants is kind of bullshit right
[7075.63s -> 7080.16s]  what what does that mean I have to have like sports like they didn't actually play the sport
[7080.16s -> 7087.42s]  right like a sports commentator like how stupid is that so do you think that the sports commentator
[7087.42s -> 7095.76s]  should be on an nfl team I think they shouldn't like be playing the game yeah like how hard would
[7095.76s -> 7099.28s]  it be to like break the legs of one of the nfl guys like they get hurt all the time and then
[7099.28s -> 7104.56s]  they are the commentator so what should there be a different commentary league where it's just only
[7104.56s -> 7111.36s]  the sports commentators against no I'm saying the opposite I'm saying that it's totally fine
[7111.36s -> 7116.16s]  for a sports commentator to exist and I in this situation am the sports commentator who watched
[7116.16s -> 7121.44s]  someone play god of war and realized that that is worthy of game of the year so you were sitting
[7121.44s -> 7127.52s]  there circling with a pen with the that white pen on the glass you know how you can like watch a
[7127.52s -> 7132.64s]  movie and say like that's one of the best movies I've watched this year okay uh I did that but it
[7132.64s -> 7141.28s]  was a video game so god of war is your favorite movie of 2022 uh I'd have to think about what
[7141.28s -> 7150.02s]  movies actually came out because if we're judging by how you mean by that then that then god of war
[7150.02s -> 7160.66s]  was a movie to you uh it's it's still objectively a video game I'm pretty sure god of war is a video
[7160.74s -> 7171.90s]  game no matter if I watched it or played it get this out of here cut scenes are movies
[7177.28s -> 7184.06s]  yeah what other options are there play what other games what other games why are you sitting here
[7184.06s -> 7192.86s]  going like I don't know what else should I do about it what oh you know you I said I thought
[7192.86s -> 7197.02s]  you were saying like what options do I have I thought you meant like what options do you have
[7197.82s -> 7202.46s]  I mean what other games were there last year I beside like I'm not allowed my top three games
[7202.46s -> 7206.22s]  of the year I'm not allowed to choose one of them what are what are what are my other options
[7206.22s -> 7209.58s]  you've got vampire survivor and elder ring what's your number three you got no you don't even have
[7209.58s -> 7216.06s]  a number three excuse me yes you didn't ask all right resume believe oh but is that like a real
[7216.06s -> 7229.52s]  game or like a movie that's a game that's a real game what makes it real are video games art I think
[7229.52s -> 7239.97s]  so okay you're entitled to your opinion how did you get out of there
[7249.49s -> 7257.71s]  are you 2016 ass argument did you jump out the window as an evil eight came out in 2021
[7259.04s -> 7274.70s]  oh I don't laugh at me I did a top three what was it elden ring vampire survivors I was shouting
[7274.70s -> 7287.46s]  about it during the game awards what was it no it was not scoring no it wasn't it was not scoring
[7288.34s -> 7292.74s]  you guys just gave scorn game of the year because of the sound effect that played
[7293.70s -> 7298.50s]  during when you complete a puzzle when there's a big a big a new environment that
[7298.50s -> 7303.46s]  shows up and I agree that was it was cool uh my my oh multiverses multiverses yep
[7304.42s -> 7315.62s]  both diverses for sure really did you even play multiverses I know you probably don't
[7315.62s -> 7321.06s]  I didn't I think we talked about this you weren't you weren't like a platform fighter like smash
[7321.06s -> 7327.57s]  kind of fan I didn't realize you actually liked it I thought it was uh you know just one of those
[7327.57s -> 7333.97s]  things that you did that was good it's actually very good I can't get through this the floor is
[7333.97s -> 7353.52s]  electrified I don't I don't have any water stir you downstairs there's like a uh a water cooler
[7354.32s -> 7358.91s]  you know what I mean that you can uh you can juice up I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm dying
[7359.71s -> 7372.05s]  I'm dead because this one this mission is rough okay oh yeah that's that's valid that I uh
[7378.50s -> 7386.30s]  there's a guy in here a guy in the room full of electrified explosive barrels what are we
[7386.30s -> 7398.38s]  supposed to do I don't why am I getting hurt by that but you're not I am oh you are oh my water
[7400.90s -> 7410.11s]  water over there if you need it I think this is where we die uh or we could just get to the exit
[7410.11s -> 7416.98s]  because we already did the mission rescue all clients six we have four out of three oh yeah but
[7416.98s -> 7435.92s]  I think that's enough we're just okay let them die let's go let them die you got somebody what's
[7435.92s -> 7447.25s]  your favorite cereal top three of 2022 uh favorite cereal the cereals is very mood dependent you know
[7447.89s -> 7454.40s]  I feel that see we can play I need to get one of those mood rings and see the color before I
[7454.40s -> 7465.89s]  can decide what cereal I want uh all right this one we'll we're gonna do this one on easy
[7466.85s -> 7478.21s]  and can I ask you an opinion on cereal you can ask me I'm an open book I'll tell you anything
[7478.21s -> 7485.07s]  you want to know about me how do you feel about frosted mini wheats love them no I know why we
[7485.07s -> 7491.70s]  don't agree with vampire survivors what's wrong with frosted mini wheats frosted mini wheats
[7492.74s -> 7509.41s]  are great for exactly 10 seconds and then they are awful you don't how do you don't have a bowl
[7509.41s -> 7514.29s]  of frosted mini wheats you just like eat two like I like I like when they get a little bit more
[7514.29s -> 7521.82s]  goopy because they're too hard at first they like cut up your teeth they're like razor wire
[7525.10s -> 7531.94s]  you like when they get like like you're eating like oatmeal like like if you're it takes you
[7531.94s -> 7539.98s]  like two hours to eat them no it depends on if I'm in the bathroom god I thought we were I thought
[7539.98s -> 7543.34s]  we were out of the bathroom thought we were in the kitchen you know that complete American breakfast
[7543.34s -> 7553.01s]  thing like you know it's up there I got my eggs bacon uh french toast cereal orange juice um and
[7553.01s -> 7560.03s]  newspaper two newspapers from two different companies you know a full this 24 ounce glass
[7560.03s -> 7566.78s]  of milk like you know I'm a complete American breakfast I honestly have no idea what words
[7566.78s -> 7576.37s]  you're saying right now you didn't even take the money I thought you took it don't burn you're
[7576.37s -> 7589.39s]  like it's not about the money it's about the chanting I'm at I've actually lost it so never
[7589.39s -> 7600.45s]  mind I actually don't want to go get it really uh are you just following me yeah what do you want
[7600.77s -> 7614.46s]  to do that's cool check these bathroom stalls these people are all shitting I'll get this guy
[7615.02s -> 7623.28s]  anybody else uh you you can see through walls if there's anyone else there's a lot of people
[7623.28s -> 7640.51s]  live at home oh there's another key I need a blue key I got a red key in here you can see
[7640.51s -> 7658.59s]  the red door anywhere where there's a red door there must be a red key um I okay whoops I have
[7658.59s -> 7674.77s]  a red key it's not about the money actually yes it is there's money in here I want it it was
[7674.77s -> 7687.34s]  hidden in the plants it is about the money okay so now I haven't seen a red door do you remember
[7687.34s -> 7700.88s]  how to point at things uh are when I'm looking for a red door on this easy mission uh I have
[7700.88s -> 7707.17s]  a red key can you see the doors or anything through the that lens whatever it is I don't
[7707.17s -> 7718.29s]  think so but did someone freaking die yes somebody freaking died no way bro someone freaking died up

[7852.94s -> 7867.39s]  so much okay so how do we get out of here uh open up your radar by pressing q didn't do anything
[7868.78s -> 7877.87s]  I know I was making it up where's the actual way to get out of here what am I doing I'm stuck in
[7877.87s -> 7908.72s]  the wall all right I'm up um there's more human beings in here I I'm fucking dead you died
[7908.72s -> 7918.66s]  where can you ping where you are I don't know yeah this is a mess I don't get out of here
[7920.08s -> 7924.32s]  why is this place fucking peewees playhouse like how do we get out of here
[7925.50s -> 7937.39s]  that's it's like a maze they conveniently boarded up every single window just in case of a fire
[7938.03s -> 7948.48s]  zero door okay there's a door up here this person burnt to death in my arms they've been cooking
[7948.48s -> 7959.65s]  this whole time oh come on and I was right I just did a circle I was your favorite kind of cheese
[7959.65s -> 7976.18s]  there what oops is it like an emote can I do like the floss or something that would solve this whole
[7976.18s -> 7983.60s]  problem well you can get to the exit zone and we can accept that we saved four people you are
[7983.60s -> 7994.10s]  overestimating how much I know where I am right now all right go left okay left left again left
[7994.10s -> 8005.70s]  again okay go right all right it's I don't have a door I need a key open the door I don't have a
[8005.70s -> 8015.06s]  blue key uh I got the blue key okay go up the stairs up the stairs no I got a blue key okay
[8021.10s -> 8025.81s]  that there there that was all you had to do no it was the room I was down in that was the room
[8025.81s -> 8032.93s]  I was in and that's the main lobby where you can exit from I just this chlorine flooding my eyes
[8032.93s -> 8038.05s]  I just can't I can't see you can't see anything and then every door every chlorine yeah just like
[8038.05s -> 8044.29s]  that like you can't see anything it's like all washed out and this like that like like I'm on
[8044.29s -> 8049.25s]  the toilet playing vampire survivors like yeah that was a pretty good attempt for a callback joke
[8050.05s -> 8056.90s]  a little flat isn't vampire survivors isn't though isn't the round always 30 minutes no
[8057.62s -> 8065.46s]  or if you play in the speed mode it's 15 there is a 15 a couple of the places are 15 one of them's
[8065.46s -> 8070.42s]  few of them are 20 did you even unlock any of the stages or did you just go I don't like this I'm
[8070.42s -> 8075.38s]  unlocking and cheating I played it all I have like most of the stuff I beat it I beat it because
[8075.38s -> 8081.54s]  there's like 10 maps yeah okay so yeah you know then why are you asking me this question well I'm
[8081.54s -> 8084.98s]  asking you this question because I know like at a minimum it should be like 15 minutes and then
[8084.98s -> 8095.84s]  you're on the toilet that whole time not necessarily yeah depends all right let's do a
[8095.84s -> 8100.80s]  easier mission I thought that was easy it wasn't didn't you choose easy I did but we just wait if
[8100.80s -> 8106.80s]  I have no idea what the hell we're doing um that was I think this one I think we're missing some
[8106.80s -> 8122.29s]  gear you know what I'm saying let's go here this place we didn't do for some reason well okay but
[8122.29s -> 8126.93s]  I need to can we get a poll can one of the mods get a pull up oh shit I don't know I don't have
[8126.93s -> 8134.02s]  mod chat open they might have been trying to talk to me yeah I mean like I could I could help with
[8134.02s -> 8150.67s]  that but okay there we go uh can somebody put a poll up for what is it but what is like an
[8150.67s -> 8157.54s]  appropriate how do I word this what's an appropriate time where like that this time
[8157.54s -> 8162.45s]  period is like you've been it's you've been in the bathroom for too long I would like option one to
[8162.45s -> 8171.73s]  be more than 15 minutes option three more than 30 option four more than 45 I can for me can one
[8171.73s -> 8178.13s]  option be only as long as it takes to finish yeah okay like as long as it takes and and the other
[8178.13s -> 8183.81s]  option is as like finish as soon as possible I'm going in to do one task done get out no matter
[8183.81s -> 8190.06s]  what two minutes it could be less than 10 minutes what is that period that's like after this amount
[8190.06s -> 8203.12s]  of time it's it's okay this is a little bit you get what are you doing I'm trying to protect
[8203.12s -> 8212.24s]  the structural integrity of the building because I'll give you my opinion after we see what people
[8212.24s -> 8237.81s]  say and I'll get in here I can't get in that window they already know your opinion I actually
[8237.81s -> 8258.90s]  don't think they do I got the two wow really easy missions are saved two people uh I think it's
[8258.90s -> 8265.95s]  wow you're right the thing broke the wood broke as I walked across it they pranked me
[8266.75s -> 8277.78s]  somebody's still in there I gotta check this hole in a second yeah we got a fire on the fourth
[8277.78s -> 8291.09s]  floor coming down into the third uh we're gonna check this pole I just realized you're one of
[8291.09s -> 8296.61s]  these guys that is in the bathroom what do you mean while the building's on fire you're still
[8296.61s -> 8304.06s]  in the bathroom I would get out I would not stay but what if like you're in the middle of like
[8304.06s -> 8307.74s]  you're about to beat like a really hard vampire survivor's level you've been trying to like you
[8307.74s -> 8315.38s]  know unlock a character or something okay no I agree I agree okay 41 percent are saying that
[8315.38s -> 8323.36s]  like more than 30 minutes is like pretty much a maximum I agree 45 I think really well here's the
[8323.36s -> 8329.60s]  thing like I didn't like clarify this that well there are lots of times where I you know you take
[8329.60s -> 8335.04s]  a shower and you use the bathroom right like in this you don't leave the bathroom we're not
[8336.24s -> 8340.56s]  we are not talking about shower okay so we're talking about purely just going to the bathroom
[8340.56s -> 8347.92s]  okay you can't get an out on this situation of like no I was I think a shower I'd say between
[8347.92s -> 8365.92s]  30 and 45 is like all right get out like yeah shower shaving brushing your teeth
[8370.26s -> 8373.38s]  all right what about is there any try to find the money we have like a minute
[8374.26s -> 8387.04s]  half an hour well but in half an hour I would say is at that point it's too long
[8387.68s -> 8398.46s]  what do you do for 30 minutes well I I am shocked that 30 minutes was your pole winner yeah I just
[8398.46s -> 8403.44s]  fell into the goo I don't I really I don't know what's going on there we should I think we're
[8403.44s -> 8415.20s]  gonna leave before this stuff burns down yeah let's get out of here oh my god this is an exit
[8415.20s -> 8423.89s]  right should be yeah I got it in it yeah 30 minutes is probably a little too long like what
[8423.89s -> 8428.29s]  about like watching a stream or watching like a like something you've never watched a streamer
[8428.29s -> 8438.32s]  like no stream when you're on film no you've never like opened up like a youtube video
[8440.06s -> 8447.68s]  or like browsed something like oh I'm gonna check no I've no god no why are you so against this
[8448.40s -> 8459.63s]  no like what like can't you just go to the bathroom finish then like go back to your tv or
[8459.63s -> 8468.66s]  computer and finish watching something what why can't you do both all right we're gonna try the
[8468.66s -> 8476.80s]  office building all right after this mission I want to buy some new stuff okay then I will I
[8476.80s -> 8481.92s]  will wait to buy things have you watched a whole season of a show no actually I watched
[8482.64s -> 8487.12s]  um I the only time I've ever done anything like that well not like this but
[8487.76s -> 8495.86s]  I watched an entire season of Breaking Bad I believe it was in one day and I to maximize
[8495.86s -> 8500.74s]  the time that I was watching Breaking Bad I did watch like a full episode on the toilet
[8501.84s -> 8507.97s]  because it's like I have to I have to because I need to make sure that I have I'm getting the
[8507.97s -> 8512.96s]  most out of my day watching this so in mid-episode I had to go to the bathroom
[8512.96s -> 8520.11s]  and I just paused it went right in turn it back on here we go I while making breakfast while
[8520.11s -> 8528.59s]  making dinner eating and I remember lying in bed at the end of this day and this I was like nine
[8528.59s -> 8535.39s]  ten episode whatever it was like almost 10 episodes into the season and I my whole body hurt
[8536.35s -> 8542.77s]  I was lying there like my eyes hurt I was like oh like I had only been looking at this
[8543.33s -> 8550.53s]  screen for like 10 11 12 straight hours it was like almost a season plus and I remember just
[8550.53s -> 8557.25s]  being I was lying on my side and I had the lock on the iPad so it wouldn't tilt to go vertical
[8557.25s -> 8562.93s]  I was lying on my side holding it like this and so to make sure it was still horizontal and just
[8563.01s -> 8574.08s]  going now and I was like almost done hey hey hey hey hey hey I'm I'm I'm confused at the moral
[8574.08s -> 8584.70s]  of the story I mean there was none the moral of the story was I've somebody said have you ever
[8584.70s -> 8591.26s]  watched like a season of TV on the toilet and my answer was no but I've done something kind of in
[8591.26s -> 8598.74s]  that same world how do I open this door there's a bunch of pressure pads everywhere
[8606.54s -> 8610.38s]  I feel like I missed a part of it because all I really heard you say was I watched breaking
[8610.38s -> 8619.92s]  bad until it hurt you know we have okay that's isn't that just kind of it's funny how that's
[8619.92s -> 8627.36s]  sort of weird proof that like you know weekly episodes probably you know I it's spacing stuff
[8628.16s -> 8635.04s]  it's really not necessarily a bad thing because I'll tell you I binged breaking bad I didn't see
[8635.04s -> 8644.46s]  it when it was on the air I watched it years later in like 11 days the entire series and I
[8644.46s -> 8649.66s]  don't think I can tell you I don't remember anything it is just melded together into this
[8649.66s -> 8657.04s]  mush in my brain I don't even know what happened in the show and I think when you say out loud oh
[8657.04s -> 8662.00s]  yeah I watched a whole season of Breaking Bad until it hurt my head it's like maybe I should
[8662.00s -> 8671.01s]  have faced it out like once a week or something maybe not that much I'm speechless I wish I had
[8671.01s -> 8679.97s]  comments worried about you and I've been stuck in the same room for the last five minutes here
[8679.97s -> 8686.70s]  yeah I'm not saying anything about it these things need a face scanner but it's not working
[8687.26s -> 8693.50s]  do we have to bring somebody over here do you think that it needs your face the person who's
[8693.50s -> 8702.10s]  never been here before but I can't leave because I don't have somebody else's face
[8703.14s -> 8717.34s]  oh there you are hi hi what was that the Muppet movie ah general we have our new
[8717.34s -> 8736.59s]  retinal scanner and he like back the bear how classic Muppets oh oh we do need a face scanner
[8736.59s -> 8739.63s]  okay that's what I'm saying I haven't been able to leave this area
[8741.78s -> 8753.65s]  well just walk out you forgot to say forehead I think we've like already rescued everyone else
[8754.45s -> 8758.45s]  so we'll have to like go get one of the people we've already rescued so just walk out
[8761.57s -> 8779.97s]  go on just walk out okay just walk out okay all right all right all right I thought that
[8779.97s -> 8784.37s]  was gonna take you a little bit longer a little bit longer than directly to exactly where you
[8784.37s -> 8797.12s]  need to go okay I'm bringing in I'm bringing one of these four steps back into the fire
[8798.24s -> 8809.63s]  why are you so passive aggressive what we're not you can't where is this last person I think
[8809.63s -> 8814.67s]  they're behind that door where you need the face scanner but we we can't I think we kind of did
[8814.67s -> 8819.38s]  this wrong I do think we kind of did this wrong burning I'm burning I'm burning I'm burning
[8820.34s -> 8838.18s]  come on axe the top door can we feel like it was uh closed I can't axe that door
[8838.18s -> 8843.52s]  no I'm out of I'm out of juice I even have one of the breach charges to blow up doors but I
[8843.52s -> 8847.76s]  don't think they work on anything other than doors you can already blow up I do not understand this
[8847.76s -> 8854.67s]  item I'm out I'm out of water I'm in a fire he didn't do it either let me just make sure
[8854.67s -> 8859.07s]  that's very clear he didn't do it either he didn't do it either do what I got in the door
[8859.07s -> 8864.22s]  you just had to knock it down I was just at that door
[8866.29s -> 8871.09s]  not that no the one we walked by and we tried to go in with the button it didn't work
[8872.86s -> 8885.38s]  I get what we afford for okay I'm gonna die though yeah I'm fine I have a I have I had no water left

[8970.69s -> 8974.05s]  yeah that was I thought that was one of those missions where we had to burn the building down
[8974.77s -> 8985.90s]  all right so what's next what do you want to do next what do you mean what do you think we
[8985.90s -> 8992.38s]  should do next what's next I I'm down for more I like I'm I'm gaming I don't know like you're

[9015.57s -> 9027.38s]  what I have right now there's um what else we got do you want to try plate up you guys think
[9027.38s -> 9037.42s]  that'd be fun is played up fun plate up plate up plate up plate up plate up people are spamming
[9037.42s -> 9051.18s]  it right now dude plate up plate up plate up plate up okay you want to you want to keep doing
[9051.18s -> 9056.02s]  this but like how about like another mission or so and then we'll move to plate up okay okay you're
[9056.02s -> 9066.13s]  talking to me like I'm a three-year-old how oh uh by the way my uh my stream is gonna crash because
[9066.13s -> 9074.43s]  I'm about to download it so just be aware is that how that works kind of okay then I will also
[9074.51s -> 9091.12s]  download it okay I got it let's do a full uh playthrough of uh elgin ring co-op you know that
[9091.12s -> 9110.98s]  would that no well everyone's yelling at me now because I said no can you even do that I think
[9110.98s -> 9117.22s]  it's kind of a pain in the ass as they always are you you excited for this you do you play the old
[9117.22s -> 9122.58s]  armored core games I actually did not but I know a lot of people were really waiting for that so I am
[9123.30s -> 9132.38s]  vicariously happy for them I'm one of those people so yeah that's awesome I hope uh it's good
[9133.18s -> 9154.61s]  they do have a mod where you can do it how hard is the mod to set up is it pain or is it easy uh
[9154.61s -> 9160.61s]  I've I've modded stuff for before it's not very hard people do co-op with randomizer
[9162.21s -> 9170.26s]  actually that would be kind of funny sir do you want to do uh co-op elden ring with randomizer on
[9170.98s -> 9177.44s]  uh random enemies or random items or both I think just just randomize the whole thing so we like
[9177.44s -> 9183.44s]  like margaret can just like be in like a dungeon just walking around yeah I I played a little
[9183.44s -> 9190.22s]  bit with that early on when it was a lot less functional but it was fun there's also one that
[9190.22s -> 9194.38s]  randomizes like every item drop in the world I think it's part of the same thing feel like
[9194.38s -> 9198.30s]  you'll go like you don't like pre-plan like oh this is the spot where you get the sword like
[9198.30s -> 9205.34s]  you'll kill margaret and get like a pocketful of sand really okay yeah but also like the first
[9205.34s -> 9212.78s]  item you pick up could be like you know void forage drop from shaper yeah all right let's
[9212.78s -> 9222.46s]  do it soon what's your schedule like okay uh I'm myriad's returning on Thursday so I really need to
[9222.46s -> 9230.40s]  like be ready for that this week but after that what day next week what is myriad there is this
[9230.40s -> 9237.28s]  tabletop show that I run on my channel you know I got some known gamers from twitch streamers
[9237.28s -> 9242.56s]  you know just you know playing along interesting I'm the dungeon master and also I made the whole
[9242.56s -> 9250.37s]  thing and you know you ask me that every time and it's like uh one of these days you'll know
[9250.37s -> 9259.34s]  because you'll get to play and it definitely will happen one day yeah and where could they find you
[9264.96s -> 9271.90s]  not stir like a bowl stir like the Dutch word for star wait is that what that is it's not it's it is
[9271.90s -> 9278.14s]  star in a lot of different languages really yeah I didn't know that that's a little bit of lore
[9278.38s -> 9294.46s]  there now I don't hear the switches I got it I got it I got it oh my god we're getting electrified
[9298.86s -> 9318.45s]  uh now you're thinking with portals oh clever boy but yeah too long didn't read I could play next
[9318.45s -> 9331.82s]  week okay cool or after Thursday let's uh let's figure out how to set it up oh that hurts me
[9332.54s -> 9335.18s]  I'm surprised I'm surprised you're interested in doing it
[9336.06s -> 9340.94s]  well I mean you played elder ring but like normally I feel like we did switch personalities
[9340.94s -> 9344.38s]  because I'm the guy who will come to you like do you want to play this game also install all of
[9344.38s -> 9353.62s]  this random shit yeah I mean I'll be honest if this was any other from software game then
[9354.58s -> 9359.38s]  put down your summoning stone hold on wait no that's not you are we on the same password
[9359.38s -> 9364.10s]  um I don't know there's eight summoning stones here oh no I just I just uh sorry I just brought
[9364.10s -> 9370.18s]  in this guy a ball fondler oh yeah whoops I'm sorry we just got invaded five times oh whoops
[9370.98s -> 9374.66s]  that's why it's more fun all right yeah like we can actually potentially do it
[9380.67s -> 9385.71s]  oh wait you died oh shit time to spend 20 minutes resetting that whole thing up again
[9387.76s -> 9410.06s]  that that's why that was always never fun to do all true what a dogshit game okay there's people
[9410.06s -> 9418.62s]  in where are these people oh on the ground the seamless co-op mod is really easy to okay that's
[9418.62s -> 9428.21s]  encouraging it's good to know yeah souls modding stuff is always pretty simple we've got like
[9429.65s -> 9435.97s]  thousands of people on the job so do you want to make some rules here some rules because I imagine
[9435.97s -> 9444.08s]  in here get the money I imagine if we if we pull this off and we do this right do do we get okay
[9444.08s -> 9449.76s]  let's say we start and where you know when the first place you spawn where like the tree sentinel
[9449.76s -> 9457.98s]  is is like one of the dragons like do we have to beat that or do you like what are the rules like
[9457.98s -> 9465.44s]  can we reset and like redo a seed like what do we have the rules you can run away from things
[9465.44s -> 9471.76s]  but then chat's gonna spam but then like serious like if if the first boss in the direction we go
[9471.84s -> 9477.76s]  is like millennia right there is a degree of like why are we here like we just physically can't do
[9477.76s -> 9489.28s]  it the enemy scales the dragon is just as powerful as the tree sentinel really okay if that's the
[9489.28s -> 9495.52s]  case then that's kind of funny that sounds good it sounds good to me they scale all right okay
[9495.52s -> 9512.82s]  time to leave we got all the guys health and damage bowl skill I'm done I'm down all right
[9512.82s -> 9521.07s]  you ready to play it up sure you want to take a quick BRB uh sure I'll go you know drain the old
[9521.79s -> 9539.63s]  you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying hello why do you still have that hello I don't
