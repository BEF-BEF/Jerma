[4.54s -> 26.10s]  Time for balloons. Hmm. Smash Brothers? Flave Worms. Alright, that sounds kind of fun to me.
[26.10s -> 35.27s]  What do they got for balloons here? They have balloons too. We're gonna get like the good,
[35.27s -> 59.24s]  the fun one. GeoGuessr? Have you guys played GeoGuessr? BTD5. Alright, let's get it open.
[59.24s -> 71.50s]  You guys can play this one. You guys can play one level of this one. Me versus you guys,
[71.50s -> 83.83s]  tic-tac-toe. Now this guy's got a black bar on the side of his stream, which sucks. Alright,
[83.83s -> 90.89s]  so I have a... I think I know how to play this game, kind of. So I'm gonna let you guys decide
[90.89s -> 109.66s]  what the hell to do. Let me get this on the screen. I don't need to see that down there.
[109.66s -> 122.60s]  Make sure it's big enough. Let's turn off the BRB screen, get the audio on here. Actually,
[122.60s -> 133.77s]  I need to... Speaking of audio, because this is extraordinarily loud. That's better. Now
[133.77s -> 147.69s]  we can actually hear what's going on. Okay, so where are we going? Did we just play him?
[148.09s -> 165.29s]  Td6. No, we're on td5. We're gonna play. That's what everybody wants.
[166.10s -> 187.94s]  Play. New game. Okay, good luck. Here we go. This actually matters. Well, beginner,
[187.94s -> 194.28s]  we got... This is very evenly split here. It looks like we're going this way.
[194.28s -> 224.36s]  I'll give you a minute. Alright, it's time to close this. Whoa! No, it's Jesus!
[225.00s -> 228.36s]  What is... Oh, it's because I have the fucking click thing wrong. Hold on.
[231.42s -> 247.50s]  Alright, do it again. People were just spam clicking. Surprising that this is... This
[247.50s -> 258.47s]  is the hardest decision of the whole night, apparently. Alright, that's it. Let's go to
[258.47s -> 280.57s]  space. I can't even select Apocalypse, guys. Please do easy. I don't even... It's
[280.57s -> 294.92s]  gonna take so long for you guys to figure this out. Alright, we're going hard. On hard,
[294.92s -> 304.04s]  your towers cost more than normal. Alright, just... Alright, well, how long do we have
[304.04s -> 310.39s]  to the waves? They're gonna come from this way. Alright, so we're gonna do Dark
[310.39s -> 328.52s]  Monkey. Dark Monkey. Where? I can't put him... I can't put him right in the middle.
[329.40s -> 351.91s]  Right there? Alright, he's going right there. Now what? Yo, what is the solar system,
[351.91s -> 357.85s]  by the way? This is very crowded. Alright, where's it going?
[370.25s -> 378.15s]  Okay, I love and hate everything about what we're doing right now.
[380.95s -> 403.86s]  Okay, clear it. Is it time to go? Looks like it's time to go. Alright, clear it. Here comes wave
[403.86s -> 434.20s]  one. Speed it up. Okay, we gotta rank up. We unlocked a new tower. Share it on Facebook.
[434.92s -> 462.04s]  No, I'm not fucking doing that. What? No, this... You can't... Okay, level up,
[462.04s -> 476.47s]  Dark Monkey leveled up. Now what? I fucking love this so much. Are we adding a tower
[476.47s -> 491.29s]  or are we upgrading? I don't know. I don't know. Looks like people want to go over here.
[497.75s -> 522.12s]  Alright, we're doing the tac shooter. Where's it going? I can't put it here. Okay. Like,
[522.12s -> 537.69s]  right here? This is where... I can't get it on top of him. Alright, now what? Which one of
[537.69s -> 554.07s]  these am I upgrading? This one? Okay, no, no, no, no. People want to start. Let's go. Speed
[554.07s -> 563.66s]  it up already. Some of them are gonna get through. Zoom for better selection. Alright, hold on.
[568.33s -> 574.09s]  Let me see if I can get this in a better spot. We could... I guess we could cut off the bottom
[574.09s -> 591.06s]  here. Like this, right? Technically. You guys need that information for anything?
[596.23s -> 609.14s]  No, no, no. You need the information. Alright, well... Son of a fuck. Alright,
[609.14s -> 623.34s]  that... You can see that, right? Alright, let's go. A hundred percent. Every single person is
[623.34s -> 630.71s]  clicking here. Alright, upgrade. Long dart range. Makes the dart monkey shoot further than normal.
[632.10s -> 642.81s]  Got it. Now what? Have I ever played Bloons? Oh yeah, I know, but I'm not playing Bloons
[642.81s -> 653.94s]  right now. I am just a vessel for you guys to decide what you're gonna do. Here we go.
[664.84s -> 672.87s]  Everyone just clicks on that. Like, come on, let's go! Okay, dart monkey level up.
[674.12s -> 680.74s]  Rank up for sniper monkey. Let's go ahead. I'm not sharing it on Facebook.
[688.92s -> 706.02s]  Hmm, it could be any one of these. Okay. I'm selecting this one. Now what?
[714.12s -> 732.04s]  No, that's not the right one. The other one. Okay, I got the other one. Hold on,
[732.04s -> 752.44s]  hold on, everyone. Don't click yet. Okay, now click. Alright, looks like we're upgrading
[752.44s -> 766.49s]  this guy. Good choice. Alright, why would you make me upgrade and then sell it?
[780.38s -> 801.64s]  Uh, okay. If you want to vote, just click the screen. This can only go for so much longer.
[804.44s -> 820.70s]  Alright, enough people came in. Upgrade. Closing the poll in 10 seconds. Alright,
[820.70s -> 854.34s]  that's it. Alright, let's go. And more speed. Okay, the first green Bloons are coming next.
[854.90s -> 893.13s]  Alright, looks like sell, attack, or go. Looks like it's gonna be go. Yeah, let's go.
[893.13s -> 905.98s]  Alright, you got a boomerang thrower. Reset it here. I think, I think that's the, yeah,
[905.98s -> 912.57s]  the attack. Tack shooter. What are you, I can't do anything. We can't do anything with the tack
[912.57s -> 930.70s]  shooter. What are you talking about? Sell. Sell it? Damn. Alright, this is a unanimous.
[935.05s -> 949.86s]  Refreshing. Three, two, one. Oh, dear. This is, this is too close. I don't know
[949.86s -> 956.09s]  which one these people are clicking on. I don't, I have no idea. I have to zoom in for
[956.09s -> 992.06s]  this. Hold on. Hey, welcome to the 12 hour fucking Bloons tower defense stream. Alright,
[994.22s -> 1007.29s]  looks like we've got a boomerang, boomerang thrower. Nice choice. The tack, the tack is
[1007.29s -> 1039.30s]  stealing votes. Why? Are you, what are you guys talking about? Use the windows zoom tool?
[1039.30s -> 1047.24s]  Well, I don't think that's gonna work. Wait, does magnifying glass even in Windows 10?
[1051.96s -> 1057.61s]  I wonder if that'll work. Alright, boomerang thrower. Let me get that out here,
[1057.61s -> 1071.42s]  because this is a huge pain in the ass. Yeah, this is actually, that's a great idea,
[1071.42s -> 1079.43s]  because then I could just put the, it doesn't go much smoother. Yeah, check this. Okay.
[1079.43s -> 1090.54s]  Magnifying glass. Magnifier. Is that gonna show up? Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no. Back.
[1091.26s -> 1106.14s]  What the fuck is that? Lens. There we go. I don't think this is gonna work. Okay,
[1106.38s -> 1121.03s]  let's see. Ready? Uh, this isn't doing anything. Yeah, you guys can't see it.
[1121.03s -> 1137.24s]  This map is hard. Oh, wait a minute. Can you see this? Oh, shit, you can't see it. That's
[1137.24s -> 1145.19s]  unfortunate because it's zoomed in right now. Damn it. That's unfortunate. Capture the
[1145.19s -> 1154.86s]  magnifier window in OBS. This is like lagging the computer too. Fuck. Oh, well.
[1155.42s -> 1166.02s]  I wonder if I can do this. I have an idea. Yeah, here's an idea. I'm gonna screenshot
[1166.02s -> 1169.14s]  this and then I'm gonna make a huge image and I'm gonna cut to it.
[1172.87s -> 1176.15s]  Please turn off the music. Um, that's, that has to come to a vote.
[1176.79s -> 1193.29s]  All right, let me get the screenshot in the right place. Uh, can you guys even,
[1193.29s -> 1196.09s]  you can't even click it. All right, well, you guys are clicking it.
[1196.09s -> 1199.21s]  All right, give me one second while I get this image. This will actually work.
[1201.86s -> 1215.78s]  This will actually work. So let's do a print screen and okay, crop this out.
[1215.78s -> 1220.73s]  So then you can actually select it and I can make it huge.
[1221.29s -> 1249.62s]  Yeah, that's much better. Much, much better. Okay, side panel, add image, side panel.
[1252.18s -> 1286.70s]  There it is. How am I going to make it? Okay, somehow this is worse. All right.
[1286.70s -> 1290.62s]  So whenever we want to do this, I'm going to put that on screen. Look at that.
[1290.62s -> 1301.26s]  Better. All right. You ready to play? Where would you like me to go?
[1301.26s -> 1306.09s]  Oh, if you want a tower, then here's what you have to do. If you want a new tower,
[1306.09s -> 1319.32s]  you guys have to click here, like over here, and then I'll bring up the new, the window.
[1319.32s -> 1324.28s]  All right. Looks like people want a tower. All right. Let's clear that.
[1324.28s -> 1342.01s]  Do it again. Where would you like it? This is all right.
[1342.01s -> 1347.42s]  I can only do this for so much longer before I have to stop.
[1347.42s -> 1351.59s]  All right. You got the, just making sure it works. So we're going to do boomerang.
[1351.59s -> 1373.78s]  Where would you like the boomerang to go? This is the worst stream ever.
[1373.78s -> 1381.53s]  I actually like, think this is, I've actually have like a good time.
[1381.53s -> 1397.64s]  Reset it. Do it again. All right. It looks like you want them down here.
[1397.64s -> 1402.50s]  Can I, I can't even fit them here. Can I? Okay. That's where it's going.
[1409.08s -> 1417.62s]  And you click here. I can't do anything else with him. What am I supposed to do?
[1422.81s -> 1427.38s]  Somebody said I'm too drunk for this. All right. Here it comes.
[1427.38s -> 1448.98s]  Good placement, guys. Good placement. We did it. We did it.
[1448.98s -> 1483.10s]  Congratulations. We did it. Really? You brought him in for one turn.
[1483.10s -> 1510.06s]  Now my fucking God. All right. Now you want a new tower.
[1510.06s -> 1514.97s]  No, a new tower now is what I want. Give me a new tower.
[1514.97s -> 1525.80s]  I'll take one, please. What could you possibly,
[1525.80s -> 1534.41s]  you're not going to buy the boomerang again. You guys are out of your fucking minds.
[1538.60s -> 1544.15s]  Why? Where would you like me to put them?
[1562.49s -> 1570.17s]  Well, this is turning out to be a fucking huge waste of time.
[1570.17s -> 1575.14s]  Anything else? Three, two, one.
[1579.70s -> 1597.16s]  Why would you do this? This is not even, this is not even interesting.
[1608.84s -> 1617.10s]  Okay. Hmm. Let's buy another tower. That sounds like fun.
[1617.74s -> 1625.00s]  Sniper attack? No, boomerang again. Boomerang? Nice.
[1625.00s -> 1630.15s]  All right. So, I mean, where should I put them?
[1630.15s -> 1633.67s]  That's, you know, important. The placement of the character.
[1633.67s -> 1648.07s]  Where should you go? Okay. Pretty good spot for him, I think.
[1648.07s -> 1654.50s]  Are we going to play? Or are you going to keep, we're going to keep this up?
[1654.50s -> 1656.01s]  We're going to play the round?
[1663.53s -> 1674.58s]  There's an equal amount of people that are like sick of this.
[1674.58s -> 1682.26s]  Yep. There it is. Donezo. Let's play.
[1682.26s -> 1693.69s]  Oh, I can't, let's skip. That's my favorite part about this whole thing.
[1693.69s -> 1700.46s]  That's how quickly everybody goes right to the fast forward button.
[1700.46s -> 1707.34s]  All right, rank up. We got road spikes. There's a new, a new thing over here.
[1707.34s -> 1717.37s]  Here we go. Road spikes looks pretty popular.
[1717.37s -> 1737.48s]  No, I'm not going to share it. You guys already bought Pikachu socks
[1737.48s -> 1741.16s]  and a giant, like 25 inch whale.
[1741.16s -> 1757.54s]  All right. So where, you want whale spikes? Where are they going?
[1757.54s -> 1760.82s]  You want them here. Where do you want these?
[1760.82s -> 1776.31s]  You don't want them. Why is everybody clicking here?
[1776.31s -> 1789.69s]  Spikes are on go. That didn't do, no. What?
[1790.33s -> 1794.58s]  Where do you want me to put these spikes?
[1794.58s -> 1808.82s]  Okay. I'm going to clear this because I don't think you get this is correct.
[1808.82s -> 1814.31s]  Where do you want this to be? Here.
[1814.31s -> 1830.25s]  Okay. They're there. Now what?
[1830.25s -> 1839.29s]  More. More road spikes in the same place.
[1839.29s -> 1845.85s]  You sure? Doesn't look like it.
[1845.85s -> 1861.88s]  Looks like I'm just clicking the go button. 10 seconds.
[1861.88s -> 1866.49s]  And that's, that's it. I'm, I'm go. Go.
[1866.49s -> 1880.41s]  I had to close it right there.
[1880.41s -> 1885.00s]  All right. Look at the round is over.
[1885.00s -> 1890.81s]  That's a lot of balloons. You sure you guys are,
[1890.81s -> 1892.49s]  I don't know if you guys are correct about this.
[1892.49s -> 1895.45s]  We've got a lot. What about the money?
[1895.45s -> 1898.70s]  Okay. Level up. Dart monkey level up.
[1898.70s -> 1909.96s]  Unlocked access to enhanced eyesight and access to multi-target.
[1909.96s -> 1918.28s]  All right. Click on boomerang.
[1918.28s -> 1924.42s]  Sure thing. All right.
[1924.42s -> 1926.66s]  In three, two, one, we come back.
[1926.66s -> 1937.11s]  Looks like most people wanted this to be upgraded.
[1937.11s -> 1941.11s]  Some of you guys there are funny jokesters, pranksters.
[1941.11s -> 1946.46s]  That's fine. All right.
[1946.46s -> 1949.24s]  We're going to do a multi-target with the boomerang.
[1949.24s -> 1964.02s]  Anything else? Why am I playing a game I used to play in school
[1964.02s -> 1974.58s]  back in the fifth grade? No, I'm resetting this shit.
[1974.66s -> 1980.36s]  No. And I did, I somehow made it worse. Why?
[1980.36s -> 1990.70s]  I'm waiting until at least a thousand votes for this one.
[1990.70s -> 2010.17s]  700 votes. There we go.
[2010.17s -> 2016.74s]  Can people double vote? It's one vote per viewer.
[2016.74s -> 2031.11s]  New tower. Yeah, that's good. New tower.
[2031.11s -> 2032.55s]  Can we move our vote around?
[2032.55s -> 2034.79s]  You just click on the screen and it counts as a vote.
[2034.79s -> 2039.35s]  Can you click somewhere else to change your vote?
[2039.35s -> 2048.01s]  I don't, I don't think so.
[2048.01s -> 2050.17s]  All right. We're going to take the sniper.
[2050.17s -> 2057.83s]  Good choice. Pretty good choice, I would say.
[2057.83s -> 2069.82s]  Where's it gone? Hmm.
[2069.82s -> 2080.90s]  Doesn't fit here. It can't go there.
[2080.90s -> 2083.06s]  Right here? Why can this not fit here?
[2083.06s -> 2088.76s]  Is there a reason why this can't go right here?
[2088.76s -> 2094.10s]  This is the only place I can put it is right here.
[2094.10s -> 2101.86s]  It's got to be on land. Oh, I see. Okay.
[2101.86s -> 2103.86s]  Well, this seems like it's the best place to put it.
[2103.86s -> 2108.33s]  Somewhere like in here. Like right here.
[2110.87s -> 2112.63s]  Zoom in? I can't zoom in.
[2112.63s -> 2124.41s]  All right, right there. Very good.
[2124.41s -> 2147.19s]  What's next? Nice try, everybody.
[2147.19s -> 2149.43s]  4k viewers for a children's game.
[2149.43s -> 2160.38s]  All right, here we go. Again.
[2160.38s -> 2164.84s]  We're just going to go again. Pretty good call.
[2164.84s -> 2176.68s]  Let's play this game on cool math games.
[2177.62s -> 2178.82s]  Where we are right now, man.
[2178.82s -> 2182.47s]  Oh, no, we're not. We're on the actual website.
[2182.47s -> 2184.79s]  We're on the Ninja Kiwi website.
[2184.79s -> 2194.20s]  What's next? New tower.
[2194.20s -> 2195.80s]  Unfortunately, I don't have my screenshot.
[2195.80s -> 2197.00s]  It doesn't have...
[2197.00s -> 2199.16s]  You kind of need to remember where your things are
[2199.16s -> 2201.88s]  because that... Remember the spot that that's in.
[2214.78s -> 2220.55s]  Wow. Not one person has decided to click anywhere else.
[2220.55s -> 2221.51s]  That's actually pretty...
[2221.51s -> 2223.27s]  Nobody they clicked on the guy's nose over here.
[2224.84s -> 2225.56s]  That's crazy.
[2226.12s -> 2229.02s]  There was almost 600 votes at the same place.
[2232.78s -> 2236.71s]  Okay, let's put them down.
[2236.71s -> 2252.04s]  Where is it going?
[2252.04s -> 2253.88s]  I guess in this general vicinity.
[2253.88s -> 2254.76s]  That sounds fine.
[2254.76s -> 2268.01s]  Like right here.
[2268.01s -> 2272.14s]  All right, I'm gonna try to get right in the middle.
[2272.14s -> 2275.62s]  If I even can.
[2275.62s -> 2277.22s]  Right here. Right there.
[2277.22s -> 2283.40s]  It won't hit anything if it's in the middle.
[2283.40s -> 2284.52s]  Yeah, right there.
[2284.52s -> 2301.70s]  All right, let's go.
[2301.70s -> 2303.78s]  I can't believe this is still going.
[2303.78s -> 2305.58s]  Now neither can I.
[2305.58s -> 2324.18s]  For some reason, I'm still interested in this.
[2324.18s -> 2326.18s]  All right, dart monkey leveled up.
[2326.18s -> 2334.62s]  What would you like me to do with them?
[2334.62s -> 2349.91s]  Okay, I don't understand.
[2349.91s -> 2351.03s]  Wrong one.
[2351.03s -> 2357.26s]  Wait, get... Do it again.
[2357.34s -> 2357.98s]  This one.
[2357.98s -> 2358.48s]  Okay.
[2373.43s -> 2373.93s]  15%.
[2374.79s -> 2375.29s]  13%.
[2376.84s -> 2379.08s]  36% say they want razor sharp.
[2379.08s -> 2385.53s]  Could pop two balloons at the same time.
[2385.53s -> 2395.86s]  All right, again.
[2395.86s -> 2398.71s]  Okay, double upgrade it seems.
[2398.71s -> 2410.87s]  Where are we going from here?
[2410.87s -> 2413.10s]  All right, speed it up.
[2413.10s -> 2414.82s]  Let's see if it was the right call.
[2424.36s -> 2425.08s]  Rank seven.
[2426.63s -> 2429.51s]  Another new tower here.
[2429.51s -> 2435.50s]  But we don't have any money.
[2435.50s -> 2438.18s]  I don't have enough money for that.
[2438.18s -> 2441.22s]  Why am I saying me?
[2441.22s -> 2442.42s]  This is you guys.
[2442.42s -> 2443.86s]  You don't have enough money for this.
[2443.86s -> 2456.04s]  So what round do you think you guys are going to lose on?
[2456.52s -> 2463.72s]  Again.
[2463.72s -> 2466.95s]  Oh, no, no, this is the...
[2466.95s -> 2467.91s]  Hold on a minute here.
[2467.91s -> 2475.11s]  Hold on a minute here.
[2475.11s -> 2475.91s]  A lot of money.
[2475.91s -> 2478.23s]  A lot of subs came in too that I missed.
[2478.23s -> 2483.08s]  I'll make sure I touch upon them when we're done.
[2483.08s -> 2484.36s]  But thank you so much.
[2485.16s -> 2486.20s]  M.H. Harmless.
[2486.20s -> 2487.16s]  Thanks for the $50.
[2487.16s -> 2488.98s]  Now you have money for it.
[2488.98s -> 2490.26s]  Thanks for 50 bucks.
[2490.26s -> 2495.37s]  That's a huge amount of money, man.
[2495.37s -> 2500.42s]  Thank you.
[2500.42s -> 2502.52s]  It's funny, I don't even have to say anything anymore.
[2502.52s -> 2519.40s]  I just... Really?
[2519.40s -> 2520.12s]  Okay.
[2520.12s -> 2527.67s]  I don't know why...
[2528.62s -> 2532.66s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2532.66s -> 2538.62s]  Not sell strong because you can't click down here.
[2538.62s -> 2541.91s]  Why not?
[2541.91s -> 2543.11s]  You should be able to click down there.
[2543.11s -> 2544.23s]  That's kind of stupid.
[2544.23s -> 2546.55s]  So you want it strong.
[2546.55s -> 2549.30s]  All right.
[2549.30s -> 2558.28s]  Strong.
[2558.28s -> 2558.84s]  Okay.
[2558.84s -> 2560.31s]  We got it.
[2560.31s -> 2560.87s]  We got... We're good.
[2560.87s -> 2561.11s]  We're good.
[2561.11s -> 2571.96s]  Everything's fine.
[2571.96s -> 2573.80s]  You guys are doing a really good job.
[2573.80s -> 2583.29s]  Start it again.
[2583.29s -> 2585.13s]  How much longer am I going to do this?
[2585.99s -> 2586.87s]  I don't know.
[2586.87s -> 2591.91s]  Tonight was real weird.
[2591.91s -> 2596.25s]  But whatever.
[2596.25s -> 2596.73s]  Okay.
[2596.73s -> 2597.85s]  Let's open that up.
[2597.85s -> 2603.48s]  Make sure you know what you're clicking on here.
[2603.48s -> 2616.47s]  All right.
[2616.47s -> 2621.94s]  Looks like we want Cannon.
[2621.94s -> 2634.26s]  Cannon, where is it going?
[2634.26s -> 2635.14s]  Losing viewers?
[2635.14s -> 2636.10s]  It's all right.
[2636.10s -> 2642.65s]  We're just hanging out having fun.
[2642.65s -> 2643.45s]  Hmm.
[2643.45s -> 2652.52s]  Over here or over here?
[2652.52s -> 2656.76s]  There's a lot of different opinions apparently right now on balloons tower defense.
[2656.76s -> 2662.68s]  The general consensus for the majority is...
[2662.68s -> 2663.96s]  Well, that's not even a...
[2663.96s -> 2665.22s]  Yeah.
[2665.22s -> 2666.38s]  Right here?
[2666.38s -> 2666.78s]  All right.
[2666.78s -> 2677.54s]  Let's go.
[2677.54s -> 2679.06s]  Chat is min maxing.
[2679.06s -> 2684.97s]  The balloons have a powerful new advancement regrowth.
[2684.97s -> 2686.97s]  These balloons are distinguished by their heart shape.
[2688.34s -> 2691.38s]  If not popped quickly, they will grow layers back to their original size.
[2691.38s -> 2692.98s]  Make sure you guys are aware of that.
[2692.98s -> 2697.08s]  Is that it?
[2697.08s -> 2698.68s]  That was the whole round.
[2698.68s -> 2704.46s]  Okay.
[2704.46s -> 2718.23s]  Put on some music.
[2719.35s -> 2719.75s]  Okay.
[2719.75s -> 2720.55s]  I'll put on some music.
[2720.55s -> 2721.51s]  That sounds like a good idea.
[2723.54s -> 2724.34s]  Rank up.
[2724.34s -> 2724.58s]  All right.
[2724.58s -> 2725.30s]  Let's put music on.
[2736.70s -> 2737.98s]  See, this is where it breaks up.
[2737.98s -> 2739.02s]  We're on round 20.
[2739.58s -> 2741.59s]  Coming up around 19.
[2741.59s -> 2742.95s]  Look at all these different opinions.
[2743.51s -> 2751.58s]  This is wild.
[2756.23s -> 2756.79s]  All right.
[2756.79s -> 2757.75s]  Looks like we're going to...
[2758.55s -> 2760.31s]  Got to go by what the highest percentage is here.
[2770.17s -> 2771.13s]  I got to reset it.
[2771.13s -> 2772.49s]  I've already selected this thing.
[2772.49s -> 2773.45s]  I've already selected the Cannon.
[2773.45s -> 2774.01s]  We're going to reset.
[2775.88s -> 2776.20s]  Ready?
[2776.76s -> 2778.18s]  Here we go.
[2781.91s -> 2782.31s]  Sell it.
[2784.52s -> 2784.92s]  No, no, no.
[2784.92s -> 2785.16s]  Okay.
[2785.16s -> 2785.56s]  It's not...
[2785.56s -> 2786.28s]  It's strong.
[2786.28s -> 2787.40s]  Is it strong or sell?
[2787.40s -> 2787.96s]  I can't tell.
[2790.15s -> 2790.47s]  All right.
[2792.23s -> 2792.71s]  Selected.
[2794.66s -> 2795.30s]  Ready?
[2795.30s -> 2796.90s]  Three, two, one.
[2796.90s -> 2797.62s]  Here it comes again.
[2799.16s -> 2800.36s]  What do you want me to click?
[2800.36s -> 2802.76s]  Okay.
[2802.76s -> 2803.64s]  We got the ninja.
[2805.94s -> 2806.34s]  All right.
[2807.42s -> 2809.34s]  Three, two, one.
[2809.34s -> 2809.90s]  What do I click?
[2813.14s -> 2816.02s]  Upgrade discipline, increase attack range, and attack speed.
[2817.80s -> 2819.78s]  All right.
[2819.78s -> 2821.86s]  Three, two, one.
[2821.86s -> 2822.50s]  Where are we going?
[2823.14s -> 2826.42s]  That's all you want to do?
[2827.50s -> 2827.82s]  Okay.
[2837.27s -> 2838.47s]  You guys are good at this game.
[2838.47s -> 2839.67s]  You guys are good at this game.
[2839.67s -> 2840.47s]  This is never going to end.
[2841.03s -> 2847.96s]  Are we going again?
[2848.52s -> 2851.06s]  We're going again.
[2853.02s -> 2853.58s]  All right.
[2853.58s -> 2856.94s]  Black balloons and white balloons are small but contain two pink balloons when popped.
[2857.74s -> 2860.30s]  They're immune to explosions and immune to freezing.
[2860.86s -> 2861.74s]  Okay.
[2861.74s -> 2862.70s]  Got to be careful here.
[2870.38s -> 2870.78s]  All right.
[2879.64s -> 2881.72s]  For 75 IQ, you guys are doing a real good job.
[2894.15s -> 2894.55s]  All right.
[2894.55s -> 2895.03s]  New tower.
[2895.59s -> 2908.68s]  Whatever it was, this is the ice tower down here.
[2913.86s -> 2915.46s]  People are still clicking on the tack tower.
[2915.46s -> 2916.34s]  That's my favorite thing.
[2917.06s -> 2920.68s]  All right.
[2920.68s -> 2921.24s]  Let's get the ice.
[2921.80s -> 2932.66s]  Where is he going?
[2932.66s -> 2937.46s]  I need to take a new screenshot.
[2943.56s -> 2944.36s]  Okay.
[2944.36s -> 2945.80s]  People are like, save it.
[2945.80s -> 2946.44s]  Save the game.
[2947.00s -> 2949.86s]  We're over here.
[2954.78s -> 2956.46s]  Right in there is where I can fit it.
[2956.46s -> 2957.82s]  I can only fit it right here.
[2962.62s -> 2963.10s]  All right.
[2963.10s -> 2963.50s]  That's it.
[2965.42s -> 2967.26s]  Three, two, one.
[2973.94s -> 2974.82s]  Waste of money.
[2976.14s -> 2976.46s]  Sell.
[2977.18s -> 2981.74s]  No, we're going, right?
[2981.74s -> 2982.14s]  Let's go.
[2982.78s -> 2990.76s]  Okay.
[2994.31s -> 2994.79s]  Save.
[2994.79s -> 2995.27s]  Save the game.
[2996.89s -> 2998.09s]  Log in to save your game.
[2998.09s -> 3000.57s]  I don't have an account here so I can't do that.
[3000.57s -> 3003.22s]  And I click on the ice tower.
[3003.78s -> 3004.82s]  Ice tower has been clicked.
[3006.84s -> 3014.76s]  And now what?
[3014.76s -> 3015.96s]  You guys just put it down.
[3015.96s -> 3017.08s]  It was just put down.
[3025.03s -> 3025.27s]  Wrong.
[3025.27s -> 3026.95s]  This is what you wanted to select.
[3026.95s -> 3030.58s]  No range.
[3030.58s -> 3030.74s]  No.
[3030.74s -> 3031.22s]  This is...
[3031.22s -> 3031.46s]  Wait.
[3031.46s -> 3032.50s]  We can do it again.
[3032.50s -> 3033.46s]  What do you want me to select?
[3034.97s -> 3035.77s]  Make it really clear.
[3035.77s -> 3037.45s]  Make accuracy here.
[3037.45s -> 3038.01s]  Accuracy.
[3045.26s -> 3045.90s]  Fuck.
[3045.90s -> 3047.26s]  They're right on top of each other.
[3052.97s -> 3053.21s]  That's...
[3053.77s -> 3054.01s]  Okay.
[3054.01s -> 3056.33s]  If it was this one, all the circle would be up here.
[3059.10s -> 3059.42s]  Okay.
[3059.42s -> 3059.90s]  Now what?
[3066.50s -> 3068.02s]  Now it was just put down here.
[3071.21s -> 3072.25s]  Didn't you guys just put it down?
[3079.26s -> 3080.06s]  I have to listen.
[3080.06s -> 3080.30s]  Okay.
[3080.78s -> 3086.98s]  What would you like to do now?
[3086.98s -> 3088.10s]  I placed it wrong.
[3088.10s -> 3089.30s]  How did I place it wrong?
[3089.30s -> 3091.30s]  I'm going to be going back over here.
[3092.02s -> 3093.83s]  Hold on.
[3093.83s -> 3097.27s]  Are you guys trying to correct me putting it in the wrong place?
[3107.16s -> 3107.72s]  No way.
[3113.45s -> 3113.93s]  Really?
[3119.27s -> 3119.75s]  Okay.
[3119.75s -> 3121.75s]  I'm buying the ice tower right now.
[3122.31s -> 3124.10s]  Ice tower.
[3124.10s -> 3124.98s]  Let's lower this.
[3127.80s -> 3136.76s]  And where do you want it?
[3136.76s -> 3140.57s]  You got to be accurate.
[3140.57s -> 3142.89s]  Why do you want it back up here in the same spot?
[3142.89s -> 3145.27s]  Like here?
[3145.27s -> 3146.07s]  Right here.
[3146.07s -> 3159.80s]  This is...
[3159.80s -> 3161.50s]  That's where it's going.
[3161.50s -> 3162.54s]  Right in the center.
[3162.54s -> 3163.58s]  Set like here.
[3163.58s -> 3170.23s]  That's not going to hit anything.
[3170.23s -> 3170.87s]  Need zoom?
[3170.87s -> 3171.27s]  All right.
[3171.27s -> 3173.03s]  We do need zoom for this one apparently.
[3173.03s -> 3174.95s]  Hold on.
[3174.95s -> 3179.38s]  I'm going to zoom the fuck in.
[3179.38s -> 3189.27s]  Because this is important.
[3189.27s -> 3190.71s]  If you guys are making me sell...
[3190.71s -> 3194.94s]  Okay.
[3194.94s -> 3204.46s]  Where do you want it?
[3204.46s -> 3205.42s]  Jesus.
[3205.42s -> 3212.34s]  It can't even go over here.
[3224.44s -> 3224.84s]  Okay.
[3231.02s -> 3232.30s]  I love this.
[3232.30s -> 3234.70s]  This is so much fun.
[3234.70s -> 3235.34s]  I don't know why.
[3235.34s -> 3235.90s]  Just knowing...
[3237.72s -> 3238.04s]  It's...
[3238.04s -> 3238.60s]  This is one...
[3238.60s -> 3239.40s]  I love this.
[3239.40s -> 3242.01s]  Okay.
[3242.01s -> 3242.89s]  Now I have to fix this.
[3257.48s -> 3258.76s]  It's just in a worse spot.
[3261.83s -> 3263.43s]  You guys have to come to a determination
[3263.43s -> 3267.77s]  of where you want me to put the towers, guys.
[3267.77s -> 3268.65s]  Okay.
[3268.65s -> 3276.87s]  Are we ready?
[3276.87s -> 3277.11s]  No.
[3277.11s -> 3287.10s]  You got to be fucking kidding me, guys.
[3287.10s -> 3293.27s]  I'm waiting for more participation than this.
[3293.27s -> 3293.67s]  Come on.
[3293.67s -> 3293.83s]  Okay.
[3293.83s -> 3296.60s]  There we go.
[3296.60s -> 3297.08s]  All right.
[3297.08s -> 3297.40s]  With that...
[3297.40s -> 3297.64s]  Yeah.
[3297.64s -> 3299.40s]  We're about over 3,000 now.
[3299.40s -> 3299.88s]  Go.
[3299.88s -> 3309.74s]  Okay.
[3309.74s -> 3314.66s]  Did the ice even do anything?
[3314.66s -> 3319.48s]  I don't think the ice did anything.
[3319.48s -> 3319.72s]  All right.
[3319.72s -> 3323.48s]  Well, we're at 23 of 85.
[3323.48s -> 3324.52s]  You guys are almost...
[3324.52s -> 3327.00s]  We're getting close to being in a place.
[3327.00s -> 3329.67s]  A good spot.
[3333.05s -> 3333.69s]  All right.
[3333.69s -> 3334.81s]  I need some clarification.
[3334.81s -> 3337.21s]  Are you trying to click on the dart or the ice?
[3337.21s -> 3338.09s]  I think you're trying to click...
[3338.09s -> 3339.05s]  I don't know.
[3339.05s -> 3340.33s]  Am I going to have to zoom in again?
[3340.33s -> 3353.05s]  I feel like it's 50-50.
[3353.05s -> 3353.45s]  All right.
[3353.45s -> 3353.85s]  If you...
[3353.85s -> 3354.01s]  Okay.
[3354.01s -> 3355.37s]  Here's how it's going to work.
[3355.37s -> 3356.33s]  I'm going to refresh it.
[3356.33s -> 3358.49s]  If you want the ice tower to be selected,
[3358.49s -> 3360.73s]  you got to click over by the sun.
[3360.73s -> 3361.69s]  If you want the dart,
[3361.69s -> 3362.81s]  you got to click like up here.
[3362.81s -> 3365.08s]  Like over here.
[3365.08s -> 3368.74s]  All right.
[3368.74s -> 3369.14s]  Reset...
[3369.14s -> 3377.45s]  Resetting it.
[3377.45s -> 3378.25s]  Ice it looks like.
[3378.25s -> 3378.49s]  Okay.
[3382.97s -> 3383.29s]  All right.
[3383.29s -> 3383.93s]  Selecting ice.
[3384.49s -> 3389.27s]  I'm assuming we're going to do an upgrade for this.
[3395.10s -> 3395.42s]  Guys.
[3407.35s -> 3408.07s]  It's...
[3408.07s -> 3408.79s]  Sell it.
[3408.79s -> 3412.54s]  It's trash.
[3412.54s -> 3413.58s]  It's not a joke.
[3413.58s -> 3414.22s]  It's bad.
[3414.22s -> 3420.42s]  Well, how is it voted for in the first place?
[3420.42s -> 3421.70s]  I've sold this before.
[3421.70s -> 3424.12s]  And then you guys bought it again
[3424.12s -> 3426.28s]  and made sure it was in the correct placement.
[3426.28s -> 3440.81s]  And now 70% of you want to sell it.
[3440.81s -> 3441.13s]  Okay?
[3448.01s -> 3449.93s]  Stop asking questions, vessel.
[3454.63s -> 3454.79s]  Okay.
[3454.79s -> 3463.16s]  Another tower.
[3463.16s -> 3465.64s]  So this looks like it's going to be...
[3466.20s -> 3469.26s]  Is that...
[3469.26s -> 3470.14s]  That's a ninja?
[3470.14s -> 3477.58s]  I think that's a ninja.
[3477.58s -> 3477.98s]  Yeah.
[3477.98s -> 3487.42s]  That's very clearly over the ninja.
[3487.42s -> 3488.06s]  Okay.
[3488.06s -> 3501.98s]  Where's it going?
[3501.98s -> 3502.54s]  Over here.
[3507.45s -> 3511.46s]  I'm going to try to get it as close in the circle as I can.
[3511.46s -> 3512.98s]  Wherever the center of this circle is,
[3512.98s -> 3516.10s]  is where it's going.
[3516.10s -> 3522.94s]  Right there.
[3522.94s -> 3523.58s]  Enhance.
[3523.58s -> 3525.78s]  Enhance.
[3525.78s -> 3526.82s]  How do you vote?
[3526.82s -> 3528.10s]  You just have to enable the extension
[3528.10s -> 3529.22s]  and you just click on the screen.
[3529.22s -> 3533.59s]  That looks good.
[3533.59s -> 3539.80s]  We almost time...
[3539.80s -> 3540.76s]  It's almost time for round...
[3541.64s -> 3543.80s]  Round like 30.
[3543.80s -> 3545.32s]  Round 20, whatever it is.
[3545.32s -> 3551.08s]  Oh damn.
[3551.08s -> 3551.48s]  All right.
[3551.48s -> 3552.76s]  Looks like I know what people want to do.
[3553.32s -> 3557.27s]  All right.
[3557.27s -> 3561.69s]  What's next?
[3561.69s -> 3563.13s]  Round 23 of 85.
[3563.13s -> 3563.69s]  Incoming.
[3563.69s -> 3579.94s]  Fucking easy.
[3579.94s -> 3580.42s]  Again?
[3580.42s -> 3582.41s]  Okay.
[3582.41s -> 3584.09s]  Camo balloons are very dangerous
[3584.09s -> 3585.69s]  since most towers cannot hit them.
[3585.69s -> 3588.55s]  Any balloon types can also be camo balloon
[3588.55s -> 3590.71s]  and so will all the balloons that come out of that one.
[3590.71s -> 3593.85s]  They can only be hit by towers that can detect camo.
[3593.85s -> 3595.05s]  All other attacks will miss.
[3595.05s -> 3597.53s]  If you do not have any towers that can detect camo,
[3597.53s -> 3608.94s]  use road spikes.
[3608.94s -> 3610.36s]  Nice.
[3610.36s -> 3612.39s]  Bomb tower level up.
[3612.39s -> 3613.43s]  Access to extra range.
[3615.56s -> 3618.92s]  And a glue gunner has been unlocked.
[3618.92s -> 3621.26s]  All right.
[3621.26s -> 3623.02s]  Any changes that you guys would like to make?
[3630.49s -> 3631.29s]  We're not sharing.
[3631.29s -> 3632.25s]  We're never going to share it.
[3637.48s -> 3637.96s]  All right.
[3637.96s -> 3638.92s]  New tower.
[3638.92s -> 3643.86s]  So make sure you remember where those slots are.
[3643.86s -> 3647.45s]  You see?
[3647.45s -> 3647.77s]  Got it?
[3647.77s -> 3648.41s]  You see where they are?
[3658.23s -> 3665.51s]  Glue is being 100%ed right here.
[3665.51s -> 3666.71s]  Move the picture to the left.
[3668.28s -> 3668.92s]  Okay.
[3668.92s -> 3670.52s]  So it's easier to click on.
[3670.52s -> 3675.34s]  So the glue was selected.
[3682.42s -> 3684.60s]  I don't think I've ever played this game this long
[3684.60s -> 3688.10s]  to see what this even does.
[3688.10s -> 3690.02s]  But you've got glue now.
[3690.02s -> 3700.44s]  Where would you like to put it?
[3700.44s -> 3701.00s]  Up here.
[3701.00s -> 3701.48s]  Up here.
[3701.48s -> 3702.52s]  Oof.
[3702.52s -> 3703.48s]  Over here.
[3703.48s -> 3708.57s]  What's the extension called?
[3710.39s -> 3711.27s]  Smart map.
[3712.33s -> 3713.05s]  Smart map.
[3713.05s -> 3714.57s]  Smart click maps is what it's called.
[3715.77s -> 3721.00s]  You should be able to just activate it from your...
[3721.00s -> 3723.58s]  You just have to click a button, don't you?
[3723.58s -> 3724.14s]  I don't know.
[3724.14s -> 3724.62s]  This is too...
[3724.62s -> 3725.18s]  I got to go in.
[3725.18s -> 3725.98s]  We got to zoom in here.
[3727.82s -> 3731.10s]  In fact, you know, I'm going to take a screenshot of this too.
[3731.10s -> 3732.22s]  And so we can zoom into it.
[3732.22s -> 3733.74s]  Because it's been so conflicted.
[3734.79s -> 3735.35s]  Print screen.
[3735.99s -> 3736.79s]  Give me a second.
[3748.47s -> 3752.71s]  Let's just get the area here so I can zoom way in.
[3752.71s -> 3759.50s]  Okay.
[3760.22s -> 3761.26s]  Let's get it on there.
[3767.75s -> 3769.05s]  All right.
[3769.05s -> 3770.41s]  So we're going to do it like this.
[3771.05s -> 3774.01s]  So it's easier for you guys to select fine...
[3774.01s -> 3776.78s]  Finite details.
[3776.78s -> 3777.18s]  Okay.
[3777.18s -> 3786.34s]  So where do you want it to go?
[3786.34s -> 3792.70s]  Sorry.
[3792.70s -> 3793.66s]  Right in the middle there.
[3798.57s -> 3798.89s]  All right.
[3798.89s -> 3799.37s]  I...
[3799.37s -> 3800.17s]  Right there.
[3800.17s -> 3802.42s]  Right in the middle.
[3802.42s -> 3806.62s]  You got it.
[3806.62s -> 3809.51s]  All right.
[3809.51s -> 3815.88s]  So you wanted it right here.
[3815.88s -> 3818.12s]  Right there.
[3818.12s -> 3819.40s]  That's as close as I can get it.
[3824.65s -> 3826.25s]  That's actually the worst spot.
[3827.58s -> 3827.98s]  Why?
[3827.98s -> 3828.38s]  What?
[3828.38s -> 3847.29s]  Surprisingly, I haven't even lost one life yet.
[3847.29s -> 3848.97s]  How have you guys not lost one life?
[3848.97s -> 3852.34s]  That's kind of ridiculous.
[3857.42s -> 3858.06s]  Indecisive.
[3863.13s -> 3864.09s]  It's going again.
[3864.09s -> 3870.74s]  Uh oh.
[3871.30s -> 3879.30s]  All right.
[3879.30s -> 3886.26s]  Ninja Monkey leveled up.
[3886.26s -> 3886.74s]  Now what?
[3888.33s -> 3889.45s]  We're going to have to enhance this.
[3889.45s -> 3891.45s]  I have no idea what you guys want me to do.
[3891.45s -> 3906.97s]  It's restarting in three, two, one.
[3906.97s -> 3913.66s]  I think that's click on the ninja, right?
[3913.66s -> 3914.14s]  Yep.
[3914.14s -> 3919.37s]  It's the middle one right there.
[3919.37s -> 3919.77s]  Yep.
[3919.77s -> 3930.14s]  Okay.
[3930.14s -> 3930.78s]  Upgrade.
[3931.91s -> 3932.71s]  Yep.
[3932.71s -> 3933.80s]  Sounds good to me.
[3945.61s -> 3946.41s]  Okay.
[3946.41s -> 3959.48s]  I got the other ninja selected.
[3959.48s -> 3960.20s]  All right.
[3960.20s -> 3963.53s]  Upgrade this one to Seeking.
[3965.50s -> 3966.38s]  Oh, Selen!
[3966.38s -> 3976.01s]  There's a small percentage of you guys
[3976.01s -> 3983.96s]  that really want that sniper upgrade.
[3983.96s -> 3988.18s]  But I'm going to have to refresh here.
[3988.18s -> 3997.11s]  I don't know what's going on.
[3997.11s -> 3997.83s]  Sniper.
[3997.83s -> 4007.26s]  Sniper selected.
[4007.26s -> 4015.03s]  Three, two, one.
[4015.03s -> 4015.75s]  All right.
[4015.75s -> 4017.43s]  Shoots can pop through four layers of blue
[4017.43s -> 4019.43s]  and it can pop lead and frozen blue.
[4019.43s -> 4023.90s]  All right.
[4030.62s -> 4032.22s]  Now it's time for the cannon.
[4032.22s -> 4034.65s]  Cannon unlockables?
[4034.65s -> 4034.97s]  Shoots?
[4034.97s -> 4035.45s]  What do you mean?
[4035.45s -> 4041.21s]  Shoots.
[4041.21s -> 4041.45s]  Okay.
[4041.45s -> 4042.25s]  I got the cannon on.
[4053.22s -> 4054.02s]  Okay.
[4054.02s -> 4057.51s]  Preparing yourselves for the next round.
[4057.51s -> 4058.47s]  You puny vessel.
[4058.47s -> 4060.31s]  You're no match for the hive mind.
[4060.31s -> 4062.76s]  We'll take over your computer.
[4062.76s -> 4065.48s]  Like those people in the unfriended horror movie.
[4070.02s -> 4070.82s]  Lead bloons are slow,
[4070.82s -> 4072.10s]  but they're immune to anything sharp.
[4072.10s -> 4074.74s]  They contain two black bloons when popped.
[4074.74s -> 4081.51s]  That was fucking easy.
[4081.51s -> 4093.48s]  How have you guys done this so well?
[4095.59s -> 4097.27s]  Seriously, how is this possible?
[4108.22s -> 4108.46s]  More?
[4108.46s -> 4109.50s]  We're going to go again.
[4109.50s -> 4118.39s]  Am I going to stream World of Light?
[4118.39s -> 4118.71s]  Yeah.
[4118.71s -> 4122.31s]  I'm probably going to play Smash Brothers tomorrow.
[4122.31s -> 4123.83s]  Next round, many zebra bloons.
[4123.83s -> 4124.71s]  Are we prepared for this?
[4134.25s -> 4135.37s]  People want to go.
[4135.37s -> 4139.93s]  Got some nervous people in the chat though.
[4139.93s -> 4140.65s]  Nervous?
[4140.65s -> 4153.32s]  Why are you so nervous?
[4153.32s -> 4160.89s]  All right.
[4160.89s -> 4161.37s]  I did it.
[4161.37s -> 4162.25s]  It had to do it.
[4170.62s -> 4172.14s]  Everybody's clicking on tacks.
[4177.66s -> 4178.70s]  Glue gunner leveled up.
[4178.70s -> 4181.21s]  Glue soaks through all layers of blue.
[4181.21s -> 4190.84s]  And exploding pineapples.
[4190.84s -> 4191.88s]  This guy.
[4191.88s -> 4201.59s]  What would you like me to do with this guy?
[4201.59s -> 4202.47s]  We want the upgrade.
[4202.47s -> 4203.11s]  Okay.
[4203.11s -> 4205.42s]  12%.
[4206.06s -> 4218.42s]  Always sell.
[4218.42s -> 4220.10s]  Strong, strong, strong.
[4220.10s -> 4225.61s]  Okay.
[4225.61s -> 4227.85s]  Selected strong.
[4227.85s -> 4240.54s]  Boomerang upgrades.
[4240.54s -> 4241.34s]  Sniper guys.
[4243.08s -> 4244.60s]  I have no say in this.
[4244.60s -> 4249.16s]  I'm only here to click buttons on the screen.
[4249.16s -> 4252.92s]  That's the only reason why I'm here.
[4252.92s -> 4254.09s]  Okay.
[4254.09s -> 4256.90s]  Make sure you see where you want these towers.
[4256.90s -> 4257.46s]  Because they're...
[4257.46s -> 4258.10s]  Here we go.
[4258.10s -> 4272.54s]  It's a good reference to see where they are.
[4272.54s -> 4273.58s]  Sniper tower.
[4273.58s -> 4287.54s]  It's currently destroying.
[4287.54s -> 4288.82s]  Okay.
[4288.82s -> 4296.44s]  Selected.
[4296.44s -> 4298.12s]  You want to know a funny tidbit of information?
[4300.12s -> 4307.43s]  This would be the only time I would ever have beaten anything on this game.
[4307.43s -> 4310.10s]  We might need an enhance here.
[4310.10s -> 4311.70s]  You guys are beating this while I'm clicking...
[4311.70s -> 4313.54s]  It's on my computer so it's technically mine.
[4313.54s -> 4315.13s]  Right, it's on my console.
[4315.13s -> 4319.90s]  So it's mine.
[4319.90s -> 4322.92s]  Technically.
[4322.92s -> 4327.56s]  Well, yeah, I got to enhance this.
[4327.56s -> 4339.16s]  Do it again.
[4339.16s -> 4340.12s]  Right in the middle there.
[4343.34s -> 4343.98s]  68%.
[4345.34s -> 4346.38s]  Yeah, just about 70%.
[4346.38s -> 4351.27s]  It's going to go right in the middle there.
[4351.27s -> 4357.93s]  I'm the host for the hive mine.
[4357.93s -> 4365.06s]  All right, it's going to go right there.
[4365.06s -> 4367.29s]  Right here.
[4368.22s -> 4370.52s]  Right here.
[4370.52s -> 4371.56s]  Close enough, right?
[4371.56s -> 4385.46s]  Looks like right there.
[4385.46s -> 4386.10s]  Click them again.
[4387.30s -> 4388.18s]  And then upgrade.
[4388.18s -> 4389.54s]  I see what you guys are doing.
[4389.54s -> 4390.58s]  I see the...
[4390.58s -> 4392.50s]  I see.
[4392.50s -> 4396.70s]  Okay.
[4396.70s -> 4399.02s]  I'm just coming to this crazy realization.
[4399.02s -> 4408.92s]  Any one of you guys could open this up right now and play it.
[4408.92s -> 4414.86s]  And then put it on strong.
[4414.86s -> 4417.86s]  Anybody could just open this.
[4417.86s -> 4423.64s]  Why are we all sitting here doing this?
[4423.64s -> 4424.52s]  We are playing.
[4424.52s -> 4424.92s]  That's right.
[4424.92s -> 4425.56s]  That's true.
[4425.56s -> 4439.48s]  All right, good luck.
[4439.48s -> 4440.28s]  More dangerous.
[4440.28s -> 4440.78s]  Uh-oh.
[4441.32s -> 4454.87s]  Jesus.
[4454.87s -> 4456.07s]  Give me a fucking break.
[4456.07s -> 4457.75s]  Okay, so we're upgrading.
[4459.19s -> 4462.20s]  The collective is clicking here.
[4462.20s -> 4462.84s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[4462.84s -> 4473.48s]  Hold on.
[4473.48s -> 4474.28s]  All right.
[4474.28s -> 4479.61s]  All right, I got them selected.
[4479.61s -> 4480.41s]  Upgrade.
[4480.41s -> 4494.81s]  I can talk to my mother on the phone later.
[4494.81s -> 4496.78s]  Oh, what did you do today?
[4496.78s -> 4505.21s]  I sat in a chair and 4,000 people yelled at me and clicked on a screen for me to
[4506.17s -> 4509.94s]  monkeys down for a tower defense game.
[4509.94s -> 4516.81s]  Oh.
[4516.81s -> 4518.01s]  And then we're upgrading this?
[4525.21s -> 4532.09s]  I guess so.
[4532.09s -> 4534.33s]  What else would you like to do with your turn chat?
[4534.33s -> 4539.51s]  I'm seeing a lot of just goes.
[4539.51s -> 4544.97s]  Okay.
[4544.97s -> 4546.86s]  Let's hope you were right.
[4563.75s -> 4565.27s]  That looks like it's up here.
[4565.27s -> 4579.72s]  We got 74% going to the tax.
[4579.72s -> 4580.44s]  All right.
[4580.44s -> 4593.88s]  Where would you like me to put them?
[4593.88s -> 4594.60s]  I need to refresh.
[4594.60s -> 4601.58s]  Refresh.
[4601.58s -> 4603.18s]  Looks like all down here.
[4603.18s -> 4604.14s]  I think I'm going to go...
[4604.14s -> 4604.86s]  How many should I do?
[4604.86s -> 4605.42s]  One?
[4605.42s -> 4615.16s]  Do a whole line?
[4615.16s -> 4617.24s]  All right, I'm going to put down one right in the middle.
[4617.24s -> 4618.68s]  There's one down there.
[4620.42s -> 4626.33s]  Is that all you need?
[4626.33s -> 4632.90s]  You want another one?
[4632.90s -> 4638.97s]  Okay.
[4638.97s -> 4641.40s]  More.
[4641.40s -> 4647.00s]  55% of you still want me to put them here.
[4647.00s -> 4647.32s]  Okay.
[4647.32s -> 4653.43s]  Refreshing again.
[4653.43s -> 4657.43s]  Every time it's refreshed, more and more people are like,
[4657.43s -> 4658.79s]  you know, I think that's enough tax.
[4658.79s -> 4661.00s]  That looks good.
[4661.00s -> 4662.20s]  It really is a collective.
[4679.38s -> 4680.66s]  You guys are at 34.
[4681.66s -> 4686.01s]  Around 34 of 85.
[4686.01s -> 4686.65s]  New tower.
[4686.65s -> 4700.63s]  It's a good thing we bought those tax.
[4700.63s -> 4700.87s]  Okay.
[4701.75s -> 4702.39s]  New tower.
[4702.39s -> 4709.64s]  Make sure you see where it is on the screen there.
[4709.64s -> 4714.20s]  You know, some people pay $15 on consoles to play this.
[4714.20s -> 4719.18s]  Yeah, but you're playing it right now for free.
[4719.18s -> 4727.91s]  It's pretty unanimous.
[4727.91s -> 4729.59s]  You guys want the buccaneer.
[4729.59s -> 4737.29s]  I don't need to see anything else.
[4737.29s -> 4738.95s]  Oops.
[4738.95s -> 4741.13s]  Move that away.
[4741.13s -> 4741.53s]  All right.
[4741.53s -> 4742.41s]  What do you want it?
[4742.41s -> 4748.07s]  This might be an enhanced scenario.
[4748.07s -> 4748.63s]  It is.
[4748.63s -> 4752.09s]  It's going to be an enhanced scenario.
[4752.09s -> 4754.33s]  Please just wait till I refresh.
[4754.33s -> 4778.20s]  This is where the buccaneer is going.
[4778.20s -> 4782.82s]  You can't put them there.
[4782.82s -> 4783.86s]  He can fit there.
[4783.86s -> 4787.70s]  Yeah, he's going right there.
[4787.70s -> 4789.45s]  Thank you for voting.
[4789.45s -> 4791.45s]  He's going right in this little channel here.
[4791.45s -> 4795.06s]  Right there.
[4795.06s -> 4796.66s]  Right there.
[4796.66s -> 4797.30s]  All right.
[4797.30s -> 4804.04s]  What next?
[4804.04s -> 4811.35s]  Didn't this game have music?
[4811.35s -> 4812.07s]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[4812.07s -> 4826.57s]  All right, here we go.
[4826.57s -> 4829.26s]  Which one of these upgrades?
[4829.26s -> 4830.46s]  That's the important thing.
[4830.46s -> 4833.11s]  No, I can't.
[4833.11s -> 4834.07s]  No, I can't do that one.
[4834.07s -> 4840.95s]  Is that all you want to do?
[4840.95s -> 4849.03s]  I can't tell if everyone is trying to get tips, save,
[4849.03s -> 4851.37s]  or if they're trying to turn the music off.
[4851.37s -> 4867.54s]  Okay.
[4867.54s -> 4885.85s]  Do you want to put it back on?
[4885.85s -> 4887.16s]  Tips.
[4887.16s -> 4887.56s]  Okay.
[4887.56s -> 4893.94s]  Tips are no longer on.
[4893.94s -> 4894.50s]  All right.
[4894.50s -> 4894.98s]  It...
[4894.98s -> 4895.61s]  Hold on.
[4895.61s -> 4896.49s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[4896.49s -> 4901.22s]  If you want the music to come back, click on the boomerang.
[4901.22s -> 4903.30s]  If you want me to put the tips back on,
[4903.69s -> 4906.30s]  click up here.
[4906.30s -> 4918.39s]  Okay?
[4918.39s -> 4920.23s]  Put on the doom OST.
[4920.23s -> 4921.11s]  Oh, my God.
[4921.11s -> 4921.91s]  Hold on.
[4921.91s -> 4944.47s]  Okay.
[4945.72s -> 4946.52s]  Now what do you want me to do?
[4946.52s -> 4953.50s]  Time to go?
[4976.47s -> 4977.03s]  What now?
[4977.03s -> 4978.23s]  No, I'm not doing it louder.
[4985.90s -> 4986.06s]  All right.
[4986.06s -> 4987.02s]  We're selecting the monkey.
[4988.23s -> 4988.63s]  This one?
[4988.63s -> 4989.35s]  I think it's this one.
[4989.99s -> 4990.63s]  What would you like?
[4996.57s -> 5003.90s]  Sharp.
[5003.90s -> 5004.22s]  Okay.
[5006.49s -> 5008.01s]  Three, two, one.
[5008.73s -> 5009.05s]  Select.
[5011.67s -> 5012.79s]  And the other one too, huh?
[5013.51s -> 5026.09s]  Well, what did you do?
[5026.09s -> 5027.45s]  What did you do last night, honey?
[5029.00s -> 5033.24s]  Oh, well, I had 4,000 people in a chat room.
[5033.96s -> 5034.44s]  All...
[5034.44s -> 5040.15s]  We were playing a Balloons Tower Defense 5 that I wasn't playing it.
[5040.87s -> 5054.94s]  They were telling me what to do and I was blasting the doom soundtrack.
[5054.94s -> 5056.86s]  Kind of split here on what people want to do.
[5059.30s -> 5059.86s]  Turn it up.
[5079.45s -> 5080.82s]  Now what?
[5080.82s -> 5081.38s]  Go again.
[5082.02s -> 5082.26s]  No.
[5083.86s -> 5085.30s]  You want to select this guy.
[5085.30s -> 5086.02s]  Now what do you want to do?
[5098.06s -> 5099.42s]  My left ear.
[5101.90s -> 5109.88s]  Is it loud in the left ear?
[5109.88s -> 5111.08s]  So we're buying this one.
[5113.54s -> 5114.42s]  Thanks for playing, guys.
[5114.42s -> 5114.90s]  Anything else?
[5119.86s -> 5122.02s]  Again, this one too.
[5122.02s -> 5122.82s]  Both of them.
[5122.82s -> 5123.54s]  Sonic Boom.
[5134.47s -> 5136.39s]  Here's the wild thing about this stream.
[5137.11s -> 5139.51s]  Remember the first like 10 minutes when we were doing this?
[5139.51s -> 5141.99s]  I was like, oh, I don't know how to click this and then you vote.
[5141.99s -> 5143.91s]  Look at how streamlined this has become.
[5143.91s -> 5145.03s]  This is almost like scary.
[5145.03s -> 5146.07s]  This is almost terrifying.
[5146.71s -> 5160.98s]  Uh-oh.
[5166.58s -> 5167.70s]  Ooh, that was close.
[5168.34s -> 5169.58s]  All right, hold on.
[5169.58s -> 5170.62s]  I got to change the volumes here.
[5171.26s -> 5172.41s]  Hold on.
[5172.41s -> 5173.05s]  Wait.
[5173.05s -> 5189.51s]  Now I have to stop for a second.
[5189.51s -> 5191.48s]  I'm gonna turn this down.
[5194.33s -> 5195.93s]  The chess game is done.
[5195.93s -> 5196.57s]  Wait, what?
[5196.57s -> 5198.33s]  Okay, I thought I just X'd out of the fucking window.
[5198.33s -> 5200.73s]  I thought I just closed Balloon's Tower Defense 5.
[5200.73s -> 5202.09s]  And there's no saving.
[5202.09s -> 5204.01s]  Oh, that would have been so bad.
[5204.01s -> 5205.96s]  I would have just gone.
[5205.96s -> 5209.54s]  I would have gone crying in the shower.
[5209.54s -> 5210.10s]  Okay.
[5210.10s -> 5214.26s]  Uh, I need to put this in a different window so I can control how loud that is.
[5214.26s -> 5219.03s]  So give me one second, guys.
[5225.35s -> 5225.75s]  What?
[5225.75s -> 5229.61s]  Why am I just loading up a random web page right now?
[5233.05s -> 5234.17s]  What the fuck was that?
[5241.21s -> 5242.01s]  Was that an ad?
[5248.71s -> 5249.99s]  I have no idea what that was.
[5252.41s -> 5256.60s]  I opened up another tab and it went to like...
[5257.32s -> 5258.98s]  I don't have any fucking idea.
[5264.54s -> 5265.42s]  This is correct, right?
[5269.69s -> 5270.81s]  That was fucking weird.
[5271.61s -> 5282.60s]  I can do that.
[5290.98s -> 5293.62s]  And then that should be open now.
[5294.18s -> 5297.06s]  I'm spending a lot of time trying to get this to work.
[5299.03s -> 5299.67s]  There we go.
[5299.67s -> 5300.07s]  Okay.
[5300.07s -> 5304.79s]  So now drop this and then put this higher than that.
[5304.79s -> 5305.67s]  Now that should be good.
[5305.67s -> 5306.31s]  I'm ready to go.
[5316.73s -> 5317.37s]  Okay.
[5317.37s -> 5318.09s]  Here we go.
[5326.10s -> 5326.50s]  Tax.
[5333.61s -> 5338.15s]  I think we're just going to go.
[5338.15s -> 5339.27s]  I think we're just going to go.
[5340.07s -> 5347.29s]  I think you're going to lose.
[5348.46s -> 5348.96s]  Oh!
[5351.48s -> 5351.98s]  Oh!
[5357.02s -> 5357.82s]  Now what, guys?
[5358.62s -> 5359.34s]  That's not good.
[5364.55s -> 5365.05s]  50.
[5365.59s -> 5370.63s]  All right.
[5370.63s -> 5371.11s]  What do you want?
[5376.15s -> 5376.71s]  Which one?
[5376.71s -> 5377.75s]  Does it matter?
[5377.75s -> 5379.35s]  Look at everybody panicking right now.
[5379.35s -> 5380.07s]  People are panicking.
[5380.79s -> 5381.75s]  I think we need tax.
[5381.75s -> 5382.95s]  Oh shit, let's close the game.
[5383.75s -> 5384.95s]  Get the ice monster.
[5393.43s -> 5394.31s]  Now what?
[5394.31s -> 5403.22s]  Oh, I got to refresh it.
[5403.22s -> 5408.89s]  I think people are panicking.
[5408.89s -> 5409.93s]  This is 23.
[5410.01s -> 5410.97s]  This is almost $2,400.
[5410.97s -> 5411.85s]  Are you guys sure about this?
[5413.29s -> 5414.33s]  Let me let the votes come through.
[5429.26s -> 5429.74s]  All right.
[5435.34s -> 5435.90s]  Anything else?
[5440.23s -> 5440.87s]  Are you clicking up here?
[5442.15s -> 5443.03s]  You guys want more health?
[5451.61s -> 5452.11s]  Yes.
[5454.38s -> 5454.94s]  All right.
[5454.94s -> 5455.44s]  Okay.
[5464.39s -> 5465.11s]  You can't do that.
[5465.11s -> 5465.61s]  Something else.
[5473.77s -> 5474.33s]  All right.
[5474.33s -> 5484.12s]  It looks like you're selecting the buccaneer.
[5484.12s -> 5486.42s]  Faster shooting.
[5486.42s -> 5487.22s]  You got it.
[5487.22s -> 5490.49s]  Come on, guys.
[5490.49s -> 5490.89s]  You can't.
[5490.89s -> 5491.45s]  We got it.
[5491.45s -> 5492.33s]  Come on.
[5492.33s -> 5494.18s]  We've got to beat this.
[5494.18s -> 5499.69s]  Is this tax or go?
[5500.33s -> 5501.45s]  This looks like tax to me.
[5502.01s -> 5506.71s]  All right.
[5506.71s -> 5510.20s]  Where are they going?
[5510.20s -> 5511.48s]  Where are the tax going?
[5511.48s -> 5514.49s]  At the end, we did three last time.
[5514.49s -> 5514.73s]  Okay.
[5514.73s -> 5515.61s]  We'll do one, two.
[5515.61s -> 5516.01s]  How many?
[5516.01s -> 5516.81s]  Let's make sure we get.
[5516.81s -> 5517.21s]  Hold on.
[5519.96s -> 5521.48s]  One, two, three.
[5522.04s -> 5523.00s]  That's what we did last time.
[5525.56s -> 5526.76s]  If you want more than three,
[5526.76s -> 5528.04s]  you got to click on that spot again.
[5528.68s -> 5529.16s]  You ready?
[5533.24s -> 5534.04s]  Oh, damn.
[5534.04s -> 5534.44s]  More.
[5534.44s -> 5534.84s]  Another.
[5534.84s -> 5535.08s]  Okay.
[5535.08s -> 5536.04s]  Here's one, two.
[5536.76s -> 5538.12s]  I did two more.
[5541.91s -> 5542.31s]  More.
[5542.31s -> 5543.51s]  You guys want more tax?
[5544.31s -> 5553.78s]  All right.
[5553.78s -> 5554.42s]  I'm closing it.
[5554.98s -> 5558.41s]  Do you want more tax?
[5564.25s -> 5564.89s]  All right.
[5564.89s -> 5565.13s]  Okay.
[5565.13s -> 5565.85s]  That's enough.
[5565.85s -> 5566.33s]  Apparently.
[5572.22s -> 5572.46s]  All right.
[5572.46s -> 5573.10s]  Let's go.
[5573.10s -> 5573.58s]  Are you ready?
[5574.14s -> 5576.74s]  Hold on to your asses.
[5576.74s -> 5582.90s]  Here it comes.
[5590.25s -> 5590.49s]  What?
[5598.34s -> 5598.58s]  No.
[5599.78s -> 5600.34s]  I think we're good.
[5601.06s -> 5608.73s]  I think we're safe.
[5609.62s -> 5610.50s]  Uh-oh.
[5610.50s -> 5617.24s]  You did it.
[5618.31s -> 5620.34s]  You guys did it.
[5620.34s -> 5621.46s]  You actually did it.
[5622.70s -> 5623.66s]  We're halfway through.
[5625.46s -> 5625.86s]  Let's go.
[5626.58s -> 5635.42s]  You want this one?
[5641.86s -> 5642.42s]  Which one is it?
[5642.42s -> 5643.62s]  I'm going to have to zoom in for this.
[5644.34s -> 5650.28s]  Okay.
[5651.00s -> 5651.72s]  Got them selected.
[5657.29s -> 5658.25s]  Enhance eyesight.
[5658.25s -> 5659.05s]  Increase attack range.
[5659.05s -> 5664.97s]  Even further allows dart monkey to shoot camo balloons.
[5664.97s -> 5665.53s]  Sounds good.
[5666.25s -> 5666.81s]  What's next?
[5675.46s -> 5676.74s]  More upgrades on this guy.
[5676.74s -> 5691.69s]  You want the spike-a-pult.
[5691.69s -> 5696.41s]  All right.
[5696.41s -> 5698.42s]  Three, two, one.
[5698.42s -> 5699.30s]  Refreshing.
[5699.30s -> 5700.26s]  Here we go again.
[5700.26s -> 5707.32s]  I'm going to let this one play for a second because
[5707.32s -> 5711.80s]  it looks like there's some uncertainty amongst us.
[5728.02s -> 5729.38s]  Everybody's panicking.
[5730.10s -> 5731.58s]  This is the one.
[5731.58s -> 5733.50s]  There's 4,500 votes here.
[5733.50s -> 5734.79s]  How is that possible?
[5734.79s -> 5735.91s]  There's more votes than people.
[5735.91s -> 5736.15s]  What?
[5736.71s -> 5737.83s]  All right.
[5737.83s -> 5738.39s]  I'm going to-
[5738.39s -> 5738.55s]  Hold on.
[5738.55s -> 5739.35s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5741.75s -> 5742.07s]  Again.
[5762.28s -> 5762.60s]  Okay.
[5763.54s -> 5764.58s]  That's what the people want.
[5770.52s -> 5771.24s]  Again.
[5771.24s -> 5779.74s]  This is split here between buying this and putting it on last.
[5786.38s -> 5786.78s]  All right.
[5786.78s -> 5789.48s]  Last.
[5789.48s -> 5795.69s]  Now what?
[5795.69s -> 5796.57s]  This again.
[5796.57s -> 5797.13s]  Buy it again.
[5798.01s -> 5798.49s]  All right.
[5798.49s -> 5800.89s]  This is on Razor Sharp.
[5802.98s -> 5804.50s]  You guys have the confidence to win, do you think?
[5809.72s -> 5810.84s]  No, you want more?
[5810.84s -> 5811.16s]  Okay.
[5811.96s -> 5820.57s]  Take a look and see where you want it.
[5828.02s -> 5828.90s]  Oh, fuck.
[5828.90s -> 5829.46s]  Look at this.
[5832.90s -> 5835.46s]  There are some arguments going to be happening right now
[5835.46s -> 5841.99s]  between the ace and a cannon.
[5841.99s -> 5845.38s]  Looks like it's going to be an ace.
[5845.94s -> 5855.54s]  Let's go.
[5856.10s -> 5857.35s]  Where's it going?
[5869.51s -> 5871.11s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[5871.11s -> 5871.83s]  Look at this.
[5871.83s -> 5872.39s]  Cancel.
[5873.11s -> 5878.50s]  Cancel.
[5879.22s -> 5879.78s]  Cancel.
[5882.81s -> 5884.17s]  You guys really are panicking.
[5885.05s -> 5885.37s]  Okay.
[5886.17s -> 5886.41s]  All right.
[5886.41s -> 5887.21s]  I have to cancel.
[5888.46s -> 5888.86s]  Cancel.
[5889.58s -> 5897.43s]  All right.
[5897.43s -> 5899.03s]  What do you want in place of it?
[5899.75s -> 5911.43s]  I'm scared.
[5916.36s -> 5916.76s]  Flank out.
[5916.76s -> 5919.40s]  I'm going to refresh it one more time just to make sure chat gets this right
[5919.40s -> 5921.80s]  because we're at the point where if you make a mistake, it's over.
[5934.07s -> 5935.11s]  Can it is?
[5935.11s -> 5940.44s]  Let's hope you get good placement.
[5950.18s -> 5950.90s]  Oh dear.
[5950.90s -> 5952.42s]  We have to enhance this one.
[5952.42s -> 5953.70s]  How am I even going to get it over there?
[5956.18s -> 5957.22s]  It doesn't fit over here.
[5963.43s -> 5970.30s]  Guys, it can't go over here.
[5970.30s -> 5975.54s]  It has to go on land.
[5975.54s -> 5976.98s]  I can't squeeze it anywhere.
[5976.98s -> 5979.77s]  Refresh it.
[5986.22s -> 5987.90s]  This is an enhanced scenario, I think.
[5987.90s -> 5988.46s]  Yeah, it is.
[5989.70s -> 5990.50s]  Refresh it again.
[5990.50s -> 5993.67s]  Enhance.
[5993.67s -> 5995.80s]  Ready?
[5995.80s -> 5996.68s]  Be certain about this.
[6008.20s -> 6011.32s]  Looks like you want it right up there on Earth.
[6011.32s -> 6014.41s]  Kind of right in the middle of those clouds.
[6014.97s -> 6018.17s]  Okay.
[6018.17s -> 6026.12s]  Pull it back right here.
[6039.16s -> 6041.64s]  Now we see the fight between what upgrades to do.
[6041.64s -> 6047.00s]  How much money?
[6047.72s -> 6049.90s]  535 bucks.
[6049.90s -> 6050.94s]  We can only do one of these.
[6059.54s -> 6060.26s]  Holy shit.
[6061.78s -> 6067.06s]  I'm going to refresh it again because a lot of people clicked up there still.
[6067.06s -> 6067.30s]  All right.
[6067.30s -> 6067.54s]  Ready?
[6069.43s -> 6071.75s]  Three, two, one.
[6071.75s -> 6072.23s]  Go for it.
[6082.42s -> 6083.46s]  Everyone's freaking out.
[6099.10s -> 6099.50s]  All right.
[6100.14s -> 6100.70s]  Let's do it.
[6101.34s -> 6105.53s]  Is it time for the round to begin?
[6106.09s -> 6110.07s]  Oh boy.
[6110.71s -> 6114.74s]  All right, guys.
[6114.74s -> 6115.22s]  It's time.
[6115.94s -> 6119.77s]  Good luck.
[6119.77s -> 6148.76s]  Ceramic balloons are made out of clay and they take 10 hits to destroy.
[6148.76s -> 6149.40s]  There you go.
[6149.40s -> 6149.96s]  41.
[6150.52s -> 6153.61s]  You did it.
[6153.61s -> 6154.73s]  That was really easy.
[6162.06s -> 6165.74s]  Enhance this because I don't know what the hell this is.
[6165.74s -> 6168.94s]  This is where the glue guy is right below that.
[6168.94s -> 6170.78s]  So click where you need to click.
[6178.14s -> 6179.82s]  Do I need to double enhancement?
[6179.82s -> 6183.26s]  Holy shit.
[6185.30s -> 6186.18s]  I'm going to refresh it again.
[6186.18s -> 6189.14s]  If you want the glue, you got to click a little bit further down.
[6189.14s -> 6191.62s]  You got to click almost near the bottom of that page.
[6192.18s -> 6194.20s]  Click on the cannon if you want the cannon.
[6194.20s -> 6195.51s]  You ready?
[6195.51s -> 6213.05s]  What the fuck is happening?
[6213.05s -> 6215.37s]  Chat is playing Bloons Tower Defense 5.
[6216.01s -> 6220.30s]  They've made it to nearly just about the halfway point and it's on hard.
[6223.06s -> 6223.38s]  All right.
[6223.38s -> 6224.26s]  Looks like it's going to be glue.
[6231.19s -> 6231.51s]  Okay.
[6232.15s -> 6233.19s]  What would you have me do with this?
[6240.97s -> 6241.85s]  Stickier glue.
[6242.94s -> 6243.26s]  Okay.
[6244.22s -> 6247.96s]  I don't know if there's any more money to do anything else.
[6247.96s -> 6248.68s]  900 bucks.
[6257.24s -> 6258.36s]  Now and the cannon.
[6260.84s -> 6261.32s]  All right.
[6261.32s -> 6262.20s]  Cannon is selected.
[6270.01s -> 6271.05s]  Frag bombs.
[6273.06s -> 6273.38s]  Okay.
[6282.87s -> 6284.15s]  That is 600.
[6284.15s -> 6285.27s]  There's another 100 bucks, I think.
[6285.27s -> 6286.23s]  Couple hundred bucks.
[6286.23s -> 6290.58s]  Now the cannon.
[6291.30s -> 6310.60s]  Same thing to the other cannon it looks like, right?
[6310.60s -> 6311.40s]  Okay.
[6311.40s -> 6314.71s]  Is that all you'd like to do?
[6319.30s -> 6319.70s]  Strong.
[6320.34s -> 6321.96s]  So I'm going to...
[6321.96s -> 6322.28s]  Okay.
[6322.28s -> 6323.16s]  This is 50-50.
[6323.16s -> 6324.60s]  We're going to do this again and we're going to do strong.
[6338.09s -> 6338.41s]  All right.
[6338.41s -> 6339.21s]  I'll go.
[6339.21s -> 6348.55s]  Do we need tacks too?
[6348.55s -> 6349.99s]  Are you sure about that?
[6349.99s -> 6351.53s]  Hold on.
[6351.53s -> 6354.82s]  I'm going to refresh.
[6354.82s -> 6357.90s]  Okay.
[6357.90s -> 6360.06s]  I'm seeing a lot less people clicking on that.
[6360.06s -> 6368.63s]  It's definitely down here.
[6368.63s -> 6369.51s]  I don't know.
[6369.51s -> 6372.23s]  That's evening out.
[6381.05s -> 6381.93s]  I'm going to refresh it again.
[6381.93s -> 6387.99s]  If you want tacks, please click over here if you want tacks.
[6387.99s -> 6389.50s]  Go can stay over here.
[6389.50s -> 6402.04s]  Ready?
[6402.04s -> 6404.52s]  Not as extreme as I thought it was going to be.
[6409.30s -> 6409.94s]  Okay.
[6409.94s -> 6412.04s]  Good luck.
[6412.04s -> 6433.11s]  I guess it's doing pretty well.
[6439.75s -> 6441.27s]  Nothing's even getting remotely by.
[6449.34s -> 6451.66s]  The cannons are syncing with the song.
[6451.66s -> 6452.78s]  Are they really?
[6452.78s -> 6467.26s]  Pretty stellar job.
[6467.26s -> 6471.77s]  I'm not going to lie.
[6471.77s -> 6481.13s]  Super monkey.
[6481.13s -> 6482.09s]  More towers.
[6482.09s -> 6487.22s]  More towers.
[6487.22s -> 6488.02s]  All right.
[6488.02s -> 6491.34s]  More towers.
[6491.34s -> 6492.06s]  Oops.
[6492.06s -> 6495.08s]  It's this one.
[6495.08s -> 6499.59s]  Make your selection.
[6499.59s -> 6500.23s]  Which one?
[6500.23s -> 6508.49s]  I can't afford the super monkey.
[6508.49s -> 6510.87s]  He's too much money.
[6510.87s -> 6511.99s]  He's $37.80.
[6511.99s -> 6522.09s]  We have $22.79.
[6522.09s -> 6522.57s]  Yeah, guys.
[6524.94s -> 6529.66s]  That's not going to happen.
[6529.66s -> 6539.06s]  I'm going to have to pull this back and see what else your other options are here.
[6539.06s -> 6541.54s]  Just go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6543.38s -> 6543.86s]  All right.
[6544.42s -> 6550.58s]  I hope that wasn't a mistake.
[6551.14s -> 6570.01s]  Uh-oh.
[6570.01s -> 6572.70s]  Are they going to make it around?
[6572.70s -> 6576.86s]  Oh, you guys are golden.
[6577.50s -> 6579.94s]  Fucking air level up.
[6585.51s -> 6585.91s]  Save.
[6585.91s -> 6587.27s]  I can't save the game.
[6587.27s -> 6589.66s]  I need to make like an account.
[6589.66s -> 6590.78s]  This is one and done, guys.
[6591.74s -> 6592.94s]  If you lose, it's over.
[6592.94s -> 6597.14s]  All right.
[6597.14s -> 6603.19s]  Buck an air.
[6603.19s -> 6607.29s]  Now what?
[6607.29s -> 6619.51s]  Grape shot.
[6619.51s -> 6620.15s]  Okay.
[6620.15s -> 6623.99s]  $2400.
[6626.63s -> 6627.51s]  What else is your plan?
[6631.32s -> 6633.08s]  I'm going to have to enhance with this one.
[6633.08s -> 6635.16s]  Or is it just...
[6635.16s -> 6635.72s]  Okay.
[6635.72s -> 6638.81s]  Do you want this one or this one?
[6638.81s -> 6639.93s]  That's the thing here.
[6639.93s -> 6641.05s]  How much money is it?
[6641.05s -> 6646.97s]  I got to enhance on this one.
[6646.97s -> 6648.01s]  Oh, fuck.
[6648.01s -> 6649.37s]  I got to take a new picture.
[6649.37s -> 6652.26s]  Hold on.
[6652.26s -> 6670.30s]  Hold on to your seats for a second.
[6670.30s -> 6670.62s]  Right.
[6674.82s -> 6692.28s]  New picture incoming.
[6692.28s -> 6692.92s]  All right.
[6692.92s -> 6703.10s]  There we go.
[6703.10s -> 6703.66s]  Which one?
[6716.36s -> 6717.00s]  Top one's winning.
[6721.48s -> 6724.31s]  It looks like it could be done with both.
[6724.31s -> 6725.83s]  Bottom one's winning first so far.
[6725.83s -> 6734.66s]  So that one is selected.
[6734.66s -> 6735.22s]  Pretty close.
[6735.22s -> 6746.26s]  But which one?
[6746.26s -> 6748.12s]  Doesn't even seem like a contest.
[6748.12s -> 6748.84s]  Night vision goggles.
[6748.84s -> 6751.48s]  Allow snipers to detect and shoot camo balloons.
[6751.48s -> 6755.83s]  All right.
[6765.35s -> 6766.95s]  Looks like people want to do that again.
[6771.14s -> 6772.50s]  Same thing on the other one, I think,
[6772.50s -> 6774.50s]  is what the consensus will be.
[6774.50s -> 6778.17s]  And it is.
[6778.73s -> 6784.38s]  They can see the camouflage balloons now.
[6785.02s -> 6789.08s]  $1700.
[6789.08s -> 6795.40s]  I think that's it.
[6799.66s -> 6800.06s]  Good luck.
[6813.72s -> 6814.76s]  Yeah, it's on hard.
[6815.00s -> 6817.70s]  This is on hard right now.
[6817.70s -> 6818.50s]  It's not on easy.
[6819.38s -> 6821.78s]  So a couple of mistakes could end the whole thing.
[6827.30s -> 6827.70s]  All right.
[6827.70s -> 6828.18s]  What now?
[6834.65s -> 6835.05s]  Again?
[6837.32s -> 6838.12s]  Again, it seems.
[6844.97s -> 6845.61s]  All right.
[6845.61s -> 6846.73s]  Holy shit.
[6846.73s -> 6849.74s]  I'm not fucking around here on this one.
[6850.38s -> 6858.71s]  What round is this?
[6859.27s -> 6862.92s]  It's getting up there.
[6870.90s -> 6872.70s]  Bomb tower.
[6872.70s -> 6874.54s]  Unlocked access to the missile launcher.
[6877.13s -> 6877.53s]  What now?
[6879.94s -> 6880.44s]  Ooh.
[6881.61s -> 6882.73s]  Get the super monkey!
[6882.73s -> 6885.82s]  Get the super monkey!
[6885.82s -> 6887.58s]  I don't even need to pull the thing up.
[6887.58s -> 6887.98s]  Look at this.
[6887.98s -> 6888.54s]  It's so perfect.
[6888.54s -> 6889.66s]  You guys are all over here.
[6891.51s -> 6892.95s]  Now here's the really important thing.
[6892.95s -> 6895.85s]  I'm going to put the image on the screen.
[6895.85s -> 6896.17s]  Where?
[6908.82s -> 6909.46s]  Look at that.
[6911.03s -> 6914.65s]  And not one person thought otherwise.
[6914.65s -> 6920.26s]  That is 100%.
[6920.26s -> 6922.26s]  Look at you guys working together.
[6922.26s -> 6922.74s]  It's great.
[6922.74s -> 6923.30s]  I love it.
[6923.30s -> 6927.37s]  So right in the middle there.
[6927.37s -> 6928.89s]  Right kind of on the edge.
[6930.98s -> 6932.18s]  I see what you're doing here.
[6932.18s -> 6934.25s]  All right.
[6934.25s -> 6941.85s]  And there he is.
[6941.85s -> 6952.15s]  Now what?
[6952.15s -> 6953.03s]  $584.
[6953.03s -> 6953.83s]  Looks like we're just going to go.
[6954.39s -> 6962.95s]  Looks like we're just going to go.
[6966.26s -> 6967.06s]  Yes.
[6967.06s -> 6968.74s]  Shit load of boats coming in here.
[6968.74s -> 6969.14s]  Let's go.
[6969.86s -> 6976.17s]  Now the super monkey goes 100 miles per hour.
[6983.42s -> 6983.90s]  Damn.
[6988.81s -> 6990.17s]  45 of 85.
[6991.94s -> 6994.42s]  40 more rounds to go to beat the whole thing.
[6994.98s -> 7002.86s]  I don't think anything's getting by this for a while.
[7003.42s -> 7010.36s]  Somebody said I've never seen a super monkey before.
[7011.00s -> 7014.41s]  You guys are playing really actually very well.
[7017.94s -> 7018.66s]  Long round.
[7018.66s -> 7018.90s]  All right.
[7018.90s -> 7019.86s]  Glue gunner level up.
[7019.86s -> 7020.74s]  Corrosive glue.
[7023.35s -> 7025.53s]  Monkey apprentice unlocked.
[7026.17s -> 7027.69s]  That's all towers are unlocked.
[7027.69s -> 7028.09s]  Oh no.
[7028.09s -> 7028.89s]  That's not even true.
[7032.78s -> 7038.31s]  All right.
[7038.31s -> 7040.23s]  We have $3,000 to spend.
[7043.83s -> 7044.31s]  Enhance.
[7047.30s -> 7048.02s]  Go again please.
[7048.02s -> 7057.78s]  Thank you.
[7057.78s -> 7064.25s]  Seems to be the cannon.
[7064.25s -> 7065.85s]  Because super monkey is down there,
[7065.85s -> 7067.69s]  but cannon is over here.
[7067.69s -> 7073.02s]  Although I can't.
[7073.02s -> 7073.34s]  Yeah.
[7073.34s -> 7074.62s]  49, 23.
[7074.62s -> 7077.40s]  Cannon it is.
[7077.40s -> 7085.96s]  All right.
[7085.96s -> 7090.84s]  There's really only one thing to do with the cannon.
[7090.84s -> 7092.20s]  And that's missile launcher.
[7092.20s -> 7096.94s]  Which is what you guys are clicking on.
[7096.94s -> 7105.03s]  Missile launcher complete.
[7105.03s -> 7111.08s]  I'm just the RTS narrator in a video game.
[7111.08s -> 7113.24s]  Construction complete.
[7113.24s -> 7114.04s]  Selecting.
[7114.04s -> 7120.82s]  Super monkey upgrade.
[7120.82s -> 7121.94s]  Building constructed.
[7128.09s -> 7129.61s]  This is pretty split here.
[7129.61s -> 7131.45s]  2,600.
[7131.45s -> 7137.59s]  Another cannon.
[7137.59s -> 7138.47s]  I guess so.
[7138.47s -> 7140.57s]  Yeah.
[7140.57s -> 7141.37s]  52%.
[7141.37s -> 7149.69s]  I think we're doing it again.
[7149.69s -> 7150.33s]  Yeah.
[7150.33s -> 7154.63s]  Two missile launchers ready to go.
[7154.63s -> 7155.43s]  Locked and loaded.
[7168.68s -> 7169.88s]  Is this an enhanced scenario?
[7174.54s -> 7175.02s]  It can't be.
[7175.02s -> 7175.98s]  It has to be this.
[7175.98s -> 7177.34s]  Because there's no...
[7177.34s -> 7178.30s]  Nothing can be upgraded here.
[7178.30s -> 7181.90s]  So it has to be this one.
[7181.90s -> 7183.98s]  Put on the red alert OST.
[7183.98s -> 7189.90s]  All right.
[7189.90s -> 7191.18s]  I'll put on red alert.
[7191.18s -> 7191.98s]  OST.
[7191.98s -> 7200.46s]  Red alert.
[7212.89s -> 7213.45s]  Sniper.
[7215.42s -> 7215.90s]  Sour.
[7217.02s -> 7217.18s]  What?
[7217.42s -> 7224.44s]  How do you pronounce that?
[7224.44s -> 7225.32s]  How am I...
[7225.32s -> 7226.28s]  Is it sour please?
[7226.84s -> 7230.36s]  How are we still playing this?
[7230.36s -> 7235.91s]  Because you guys haven't lost.
[7235.91s -> 7236.31s]  Louder.
[7236.31s -> 7237.11s]  Louder.
[7237.11s -> 7240.54s]  All right.
[7240.54s -> 7240.94s]  You ready?
[7241.50s -> 7257.98s]  Is that all we can do?
[7257.98s -> 7259.10s]  Seems we're pretty conflicted.
[7260.57s -> 7262.97s]  50% want to buy something else.
[7262.97s -> 7276.60s]  All right.
[7276.60s -> 7281.21s]  I think I know what you guys are going to pick here.
[7281.93s -> 7287.40s]  A wizard.
[7288.04s -> 7298.68s]  All right.
[7298.68s -> 7299.32s]  Wizard it is.
[7299.96s -> 7307.85s]  But where does it go?
[7310.55s -> 7311.83s]  Please let me know.
[7311.83s -> 7312.79s]  Where you'd like to put it.
[7321.35s -> 7322.39s]  Looks like right...
[7323.50s -> 7326.62s]  Right behind the glue gunner.
[7329.45s -> 7330.09s]  Zoom it out.
[7330.81s -> 7335.26s]  You want it right behind the glue gunner
[7335.26s -> 7335.98s]  or do you want it somewhere else?
[7335.98s -> 7336.86s]  Here we go.
[7336.86s -> 7338.30s]  If you want it right behind the glue gunner there
[7338.30s -> 7339.82s]  then keep it there.
[7350.68s -> 7352.20s]  Looks like you want it right there.
[7352.20s -> 7352.92s]  Like right here.
[7355.18s -> 7357.50s]  The thing is here or here.
[7363.10s -> 7363.50s]  What's with...
[7363.50s -> 7364.22s]  Why down here?
[7370.01s -> 7370.57s]  Lower.
[7370.57s -> 7371.05s]  Lower.
[7371.05s -> 7371.37s]  Lower.
[7371.37s -> 7371.61s]  All right.
[7371.61s -> 7372.01s]  Hold on.
[7373.56s -> 7374.44s]  Let's be more...
[7374.44s -> 7376.36s]  Can we be more precise on it from here?
[7383.70s -> 7384.66s]  Even lower than that.
[7384.66s -> 7385.30s]  Like down there.
[7385.86s -> 7387.69s]  Move the image up.
[7388.33s -> 7392.78s]  So you guys want it here.
[7393.42s -> 7395.72s]  Like right there.
[7406.20s -> 7406.52s]  All right.
[7406.52s -> 7406.92s]  Here we go.
[7410.17s -> 7410.57s]  Sure.
[7410.57s -> 7411.05s]  Why not?
[7411.69s -> 7413.53s]  All right.
[7413.53s -> 7417.53s]  I can't take the red alert OST anymore.
[7417.53s -> 7419.21s]  We need something calming.
[7419.21s -> 7427.94s]  How about...
[7427.94s -> 7431.54s]  How about 11 hours of ocean sounds?
[7431.54s -> 7444.50s]  All right.
[7444.50s -> 7445.14s]  That sounds good.
[7452.28s -> 7452.68s]  All right.
[7452.68s -> 7453.08s]  Now what?
[7463.13s -> 7465.13s]  Vessel stop.
[7465.13s -> 7466.41s]  Vessel stop.
[7466.41s -> 7468.81s]  All right.
[7468.81s -> 7470.87s]  Let's go.
[7470.87s -> 7474.63s]  Moab class balloons like Moabs and even larger
[7474.63s -> 7476.15s]  require hundreds of hits to pop.
[7476.15s -> 7478.39s]  Luckily for you, they tend to move more quickly.
[7478.39s -> 7479.35s]  So this is a Moab round.
[7479.99s -> 7485.37s]  They gonna get it?
[7490.66s -> 7491.62s]  Not even a problem.
[7492.34s -> 7493.62s]  Everyone was so concerned about that.
[7493.62s -> 7495.14s]  That was not even remotely an issue.
[7495.86s -> 7498.66s]  Destroyed.
[7498.66s -> 7500.66s]  Super Monkey has now laser blast eyes.
[7504.95s -> 7505.19s]  What?
[7505.19s -> 7505.67s]  What do you want?
[7508.79s -> 7509.59s]  Super Monkey.
[7510.97s -> 7512.09s]  Nah, there's not enough money.
[7522.36s -> 7523.48s]  Not enough money.
[7523.48s -> 7527.38s]  Gonna have to pick something else.
[7531.96s -> 7532.60s]  Go again.
[7532.60s -> 7532.84s]  Okay.
[7543.14s -> 7543.70s]  Oh boy.
[7550.34s -> 7552.34s]  No, it's still under control somewhat.
[7552.34s -> 7567.59s]  It's still somewhat under control.
[7567.59s -> 7569.70s]  Okay.
[7570.66s -> 7571.46s]  Is there enough money?
[7571.46s -> 7574.04s]  Now everyone's like, all right, I'll do it.
[7574.04s -> 7574.68s]  Uh-oh.
[7574.68s -> 7576.89s]  Split decision.
[7576.89s -> 7583.35s]  There are a lot of people that want to save money.
[7583.35s -> 7585.96s]  There's also a lot of people that want to upgrade
[7585.96s -> 7587.53s]  the Super Monkey right now.
[7595.91s -> 7603.62s]  You still can't do it.
[7603.62s -> 7605.14s]  Super Monkey cannot be selected.
[7605.14s -> 7606.18s]  It can't be upgraded.
[7606.18s -> 7609.80s]  Would you like to try again?
[7609.80s -> 7626.84s]  Well, you found a new Monkey.
[7626.84s -> 7628.20s]  Buy it during the round?
[7628.20s -> 7628.84s]  Well, all right.
[7628.84s -> 7629.64s]  Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[7629.64s -> 7631.34s]  Okay.
[7631.34s -> 7633.98s]  If you want me to buy the...
[7633.98s -> 7634.38s]  Which one?
[7634.38s -> 7634.78s]  This one?
[7634.78s -> 7638.17s]  If you want me to buy this during the round,
[7638.17s -> 7639.13s]  click up here.
[7639.13s -> 7640.78s]  Do it up here.
[7640.78s -> 7642.70s]  If you do not want me to do that,
[7644.33s -> 7649.08s]  then pick a different thing.
[7649.08s -> 7652.10s]  You ready?
[7652.10s -> 7653.54s]  So click up here if you want me to do it
[7653.54s -> 7660.33s]  in the middle of the round or something else.
[7660.33s -> 7660.73s]  Damn.
[7664.60s -> 7665.24s]  All righty then.
[7669.26s -> 7669.82s]  All right.
[7669.82s -> 7672.06s]  Middle of the round we go.
[7672.06s -> 7683.83s]  Would you like for me to proceed?
[7683.83s -> 7684.95s]  Just was making sure.
[7684.95s -> 7692.76s]  Let's go.
[7692.76s -> 7693.56s]  Need 37.
[7697.18s -> 7697.98s]  Strong, strong.
[7697.98s -> 7698.46s]  I'm sorry.
[7698.46s -> 7701.26s]  That was not selected.
[7701.26s -> 7702.70s]  That wasn't the highest percentage.
[7702.70s -> 7712.86s]  That's the one I clicked.
[7712.86s -> 7713.66s]  All right.
[7713.66s -> 7714.22s]  Laser eyes.
[7724.36s -> 7725.48s]  I think you guys are going to beat it.
[7727.26s -> 7728.46s]  I really think so.
[7734.78s -> 7735.50s]  Look at those...
[7735.50s -> 7736.62s]  That's the coolest thing ever.
[7737.34s -> 7746.04s]  Well, there you go.
[7746.04s -> 7747.32s]  Spike a bullet level up.
[7747.32s -> 7749.08s]  Triple darts is now available.
[7749.64s -> 7750.68s]  2,700 bucks.
[7755.66s -> 7756.54s]  Oh, boy.
[7756.54s -> 7757.02s]  It is...
[7757.58s -> 7759.56s]  There's a lot of...
[7761.38s -> 7762.10s]  I don't know.
[7762.10s -> 7765.67s]  We're going to have to go in here.
[7765.67s -> 7767.11s]  But is there enough?
[7767.11s -> 7767.75s]  All right.
[7767.75s -> 7768.55s]  You know where they are.
[7769.43s -> 7773.94s]  I got to move the image.
[7773.94s -> 7774.34s]  All right.
[7774.34s -> 7778.02s]  Try to make it precise.
[7778.02s -> 7779.46s]  It's got to be fairly precise
[7779.46s -> 7791.93s]  wherever you're going to click.
[7791.93s -> 7797.50s]  This image is not accurate.
[7797.50s -> 7803.83s]  Well, okay.
[7804.63s -> 7805.83s]  You definitely want to...
[7805.83s -> 7808.41s]  It looks like you're clicking on the catapult.
[7808.41s -> 7812.23s]  The spike a bullet.
[7812.23s -> 7814.71s]  That's what is being clicked on absolutely.
[7814.71s -> 7816.55s]  And I'm sorry to burst your bubble here, guys,
[7816.55s -> 7821.91s]  but you cannot buy anything.
[7821.91s -> 7823.27s]  No upgrades available.
[7823.27s -> 7841.56s]  Oh, what would you like?
[7841.56s -> 7842.28s]  Don't sell.
[7845.26s -> 7846.46s]  Well, that's currently not was...
[7846.46s -> 7846.86s]  Okay.
[7846.86s -> 7848.95s]  So it looks like you're selecting...
[7848.95s -> 7850.23s]  Are you selecting this one?
[7850.23s -> 7864.70s]  Get in there and tell me.
[7864.70s -> 7865.18s]  All right.
[7865.18s -> 7869.08s]  Yes, that is the one.
[7869.08s -> 7871.61s]  It is selected.
[7871.61s -> 7880.14s]  Well, what do you want me to do with it?
[7880.14s -> 7880.86s]  Triple darts.
[7883.85s -> 7884.73s]  Spike a bolt.
[7884.73s -> 7890.33s]  Could have two spike a bolts at that point.
[7890.33s -> 7891.45s]  Did I sell the super monkey?
[7891.45s -> 7892.33s]  No, he's right here.
[7892.33s -> 7894.09s]  All right.
[7894.09s -> 7895.05s]  We're going to do triple darts.
[7899.69s -> 7903.16s]  Almost at round 50, right?
[7903.72s -> 7911.11s]  More than that.
[7911.11s -> 7916.47s]  Are we going?
[7916.47s -> 7916.71s]  All right.
[7916.71s -> 7921.72s]  This is moved.
[7921.72s -> 7922.52s]  I got to fix this.
[7922.52s -> 7922.92s]  Hold on.
[7928.90s -> 7929.62s]  That was not...
[7929.62s -> 7930.10s]  There we go.
[7930.10s -> 7930.66s]  Okay.
[7930.66s -> 7931.85s]  Here we go.
[7931.85s -> 7939.48s]  This is round...
[7940.20s -> 7942.81s]  What does it say to run?
[7955.88s -> 7963.51s]  Getting overwhelming here.
[7964.15s -> 7965.43s]  We only have 50 lives.
[7965.43s -> 7970.12s]  Keep that in mind.
[7970.12s -> 7970.92s]  Here comes one.
[7970.92s -> 7971.64s]  It's going to get through.
[7971.64s -> 7972.36s]  It's going to get through.
[7972.36s -> 7972.68s]  It's going to...
[7972.68s -> 7973.40s]  No, it's not.
[7973.40s -> 7973.96s]  Lucky.
[7973.96s -> 7980.62s]  Here comes the next wave.
[7980.62s -> 7992.55s]  I'm sorry.
[7992.55s -> 7993.11s]  I doubted you.
[7993.11s -> 7995.48s]  I really had a concern there.
[7995.48s -> 8003.69s]  Don't doubt us, vessel.
[8003.69s -> 8004.81s]  Longer cannons.
[8004.81s -> 8008.12s]  All right.
[8008.12s -> 8009.16s]  Lots of up...
[8009.16s -> 8010.68s]  A lot of upgrades at round 50.
[8011.72s -> 8012.52s]  Monkey village.
[8012.52s -> 8014.12s]  Monkey village does not attack balloons,
[8014.12s -> 8017.08s]  but instead lowers cost of all towers and upgrades by 10%.
[8018.04s -> 8020.44s]  It's many useful upgrades that help nearby towers.
[8020.44s -> 8020.68s]  Okay.
[8021.40s -> 8027.69s]  But that's down even further.
[8027.69s -> 8027.93s]  All right.
[8027.93s -> 8029.13s]  So if you want me to go down,
[8030.01s -> 8030.81s]  we're going to think of another...
[8030.81s -> 8031.69s]  Of a solution here.
[8035.51s -> 8036.31s]  If you...
[8036.31s -> 8037.43s]  Once I open up the list,
[8037.99s -> 8039.11s]  if you want me to go down,
[8039.11s -> 8039.91s]  you have to...
[8039.91s -> 8040.55s]  Let's see here.
[8044.26s -> 8044.82s]  Yeah.
[8044.82s -> 8046.26s]  If you want me to go down,
[8046.26s -> 8049.86s]  you got to click like over...
[8050.66s -> 8051.30s]  Like here.
[8053.72s -> 8058.49s]  If you want me to click on the down arrow.
[8058.49s -> 8058.81s]  All right.
[8065.06s -> 8065.78s]  Round 50.
[8069.26s -> 8070.94s]  Everyone's clicking over there.
[8072.39s -> 8073.19s]  Take another picture.
[8073.19s -> 8074.15s]  That's bothering me.
[8074.15s -> 8074.63s]  All right.
[8074.63s -> 8076.15s]  Let me get another screenshot.
[8076.15s -> 8076.55s]  Let me get...
[8076.55s -> 8077.59s]  Let me clean this up.
[8079.93s -> 8086.39s]  So give me one second.
[8086.39s -> 8089.67s]  Enjoy the ocean waves while I clean these images up.
[8098.54s -> 8099.10s]  Okay.
[8099.10s -> 8099.66s]  There's that.
[8108.25s -> 8108.73s]  All right.
[8108.73s -> 8111.45s]  Let me get one more for the other ones.
[8112.84s -> 8114.52s]  So it doesn't look as terrible.
[8115.16s -> 8116.44s]  You know what I'm saying.
[8117.00s -> 8128.02s]  What's that?
[8128.58s -> 8130.41s]  Let's delete this one.
[8131.90s -> 8133.10s]  And delete this one.
[8138.97s -> 8139.93s]  Just a moment.
[8140.57s -> 8151.75s]  Okay.
[8152.31s -> 8160.95s]  Get rid of that.
[8160.95s -> 8161.99s]  And this one.
[8162.55s -> 8165.75s]  So now this whole thing's up to date.
[8165.75s -> 8171.99s]  If it needs to be moved,
[8171.99s -> 8172.71s]  it needs to be moved.
[8172.71s -> 8175.77s]  You know what I'm saying?
[8175.77s -> 8176.17s]  Back to it.
[8179.02s -> 8180.30s]  Lord of the Rings soundtrack.
[8186.71s -> 8189.02s]  Hold on.
[8189.02s -> 8191.96s]  Lord of the Rings soundtrack.
[8191.96s -> 8193.40s]  This whole stream is going down.
[8193.40s -> 8198.38s]  Play what?
[8198.38s -> 8202.49s]  Airport music?
[8202.49s -> 8206.95s]  Some Minecraft OST.
[8206.95s -> 8208.95s]  Minecraft has an OST.
[8208.95s -> 8227.18s]  All right.
[8227.18s -> 8227.82s]  Back to it.
[8227.82s -> 8236.22s]  What do you want to do?
[8236.22s -> 8249.75s]  We do want a tower.
[8249.75s -> 8250.71s]  We did it.
[8250.71s -> 8257.18s]  I'm going to put everybody to sleep.
[8257.18s -> 8257.82s]  Oops.
[8257.82s -> 8259.13s]  All right.
[8259.13s -> 8259.53s]  Which one?
[8277.74s -> 8278.30s]  Oh, fuck.
[8278.30s -> 8281.56s]  Whoops.
[8281.56s -> 8282.04s]  Sorry.
[8283.51s -> 8284.55s]  Looks like another super monkey.
[8290.87s -> 8292.07s]  And where will it go?
[8292.07s -> 8292.79s]  I wonder.
[8292.79s -> 8298.87s]  Should I bring up the...
[8299.67s -> 8301.51s]  I wonder if I should...
[8301.51s -> 8302.71s]  I think I'm going to have to bring up the zoom.
[8303.85s -> 8304.41s]  Yeah.
[8304.41s -> 8305.37s]  I got to bring the zoom up.
[8305.37s -> 8306.01s]  Hold on.
[8306.01s -> 8313.83s]  Ow.
[8313.83s -> 8320.62s]  You're side by side.
[8320.62s -> 8333.14s]  You want both super monkeys right next to each other?
[8333.14s -> 8334.50s]  Is the vessel okay?
[8334.50s -> 8337.91s]  I've been better, I think.
[8337.91s -> 8340.07s]  All right.
[8340.07s -> 8341.03s]  Good placement.
[8341.03s -> 8341.91s]  Let's get it there.
[8341.91s -> 8346.87s]  Make sure it's correct.
[8346.87s -> 8348.07s]  Got to get it right for me.
[8348.07s -> 8353.70s]  It's looking like it's right below.
[8360.34s -> 8361.14s]  Right in the...
[8361.14s -> 8361.38s]  Okay.
[8361.38s -> 8361.94s]  I see.
[8361.94s -> 8365.70s]  Let me make sure I get this right.
[8365.70s -> 8378.81s]  How did I do, chat?
[8378.81s -> 8379.37s]  What's next?
[8384.14s -> 8384.46s]  Oof.
[8384.46s -> 8385.26s]  What do you mean, oof?
[8385.26s -> 8386.06s]  That's in a good spot.
[8386.06s -> 8387.10s]  What are you talking about?
[8387.10s -> 8395.69s]  Do you want me to click on them and upgrade them?
[8395.69s -> 8402.22s]  All right.
[8402.22s -> 8403.18s]  Super range.
[8403.18s -> 8412.09s]  Let's go.
[8414.73s -> 8415.69s]  Even more than that.
[8415.69s -> 8416.25s]  All right.
[8416.25s -> 8417.53s]  Well, hold on a second here.
[8417.53s -> 8420.49s]  Okay.
[8420.49s -> 8421.85s]  Other super monkey.
[8421.85s -> 8423.13s]  Other super range.
[8423.13s -> 8425.34s]  Is that what I'm understanding here?
[8425.34s -> 8431.22s]  How have you not lost yet?
[8431.22s -> 8434.41s]  I'm going to be real honest.
[8434.41s -> 8437.61s]  I thought this was going to be like a 12-minute joke.
[8437.61s -> 8456.60s]  We've been playing balloons for more than an hour and a half now.
[8456.60s -> 8465.27s]  Vessels shall remain silent.
[8465.27s -> 8465.75s]  All right.
[8465.75s -> 8466.31s]  Fine.
[8466.31s -> 8466.79s]  You ready?
[8474.12s -> 8474.52s]  Uh-oh.
[8483.82s -> 8485.26s]  Nothing's getting by here.
[8485.26s -> 8492.14s]  You guys are going to beat this level on hard.
[8492.86s -> 8499.26s]  Another Moab coming in.
[8500.06s -> 8501.98s]  It does move slow.
[8502.86s -> 8509.18s]  Too slow.
[8514.71s -> 8516.39s]  Glue splatter is unlocked.
[8516.39s -> 8524.07s]  Round 51.
[8524.07s -> 8528.07s]  Where to?
[8528.07s -> 8540.12s]  All right.
[8540.12s -> 8541.24s]  Glue gunner is selected.
[8546.14s -> 8547.42s]  You guys will like this now.
[8547.42s -> 8548.46s]  It's crazy.
[8548.46s -> 8559.13s]  Only $18.99 left.
[8559.13s -> 8560.65s]  We are unity.
[8565.93s -> 8569.14s]  Just as we start talking about unity.
[8569.14s -> 8571.88s]  Uh-oh.
[8571.88s -> 8574.55s]  Is this where it all falls apart?
[8574.55s -> 8581.11s]  I'm going to refresh it.
[8581.11s -> 8598.73s]  So much for the unity.
[8598.73s -> 8601.13s]  It seems like we need to go over here.
[8601.13s -> 8604.78s]  They're both the same, so I guess it doesn't matter.
[8604.78s -> 8606.46s]  This one looks like it has more clicks.
[8606.46s -> 8608.94s]  Okay.
[8608.94s -> 8619.13s]  The stream title is still Nickelodeon Flash Games.
[8619.13s -> 8622.38s]  Actually, let me change that while you guys vote for this.
[8622.38s -> 8632.76s]  This is Twitch Plays Bloons TD5.
[8635.90s -> 8637.34s]  No, like Chat Plays.
[8637.34s -> 8638.38s]  What do we even call this?
[8638.38s -> 8652.49s]  Chat Plays Bloons TD5.
[8652.49s -> 8652.97s]  Oh yeah.
[8652.97s -> 8656.79s]  Chat Clicks Bloons TD5.
[8656.79s -> 8662.58s]  That's a good one.
[8662.58s -> 8663.83s]  All right.
[8663.83s -> 8666.47s]  We're going to get the double shot.
[8666.47s -> 8674.23s]  Clicks isn't capitalized.
[8674.55s -> 8675.11s]  Whatever.
[8675.11s -> 8677.88s]  Let's do it again.
[8677.88s -> 8680.60s]  You want them both?
[8680.60s -> 8681.24s]  Sure.
[8681.24s -> 8694.42s]  Striever is outsourcing entertainment.
[8694.42s -> 8695.66s]  All right.
[8695.66s -> 8702.89s]  That's that.
[8702.89s -> 8703.69s]  51.
[8703.69s -> 8709.80s]  I'm going to refresh this again because I want to make sure you guys get this correctly.
[8709.80s -> 8710.36s]  Hold on.
[8710.36s -> 8718.47s]  You only got $599.
[8718.47s -> 8723.98s]  What are you going to do with it?
[8723.98s -> 8724.70s]  Oh, okay.
[8724.70s -> 8727.98s]  So you want to go over here and click this.
[8732.33s -> 8735.38s]  Okay.
[8741.83s -> 8744.42s]  This is so dumb.
[8744.42s -> 8744.74s]  Okay.
[8744.74s -> 8746.42s]  Are we ready for round 51?
[8746.42s -> 8749.78s]  Seems that way.
[8749.78s -> 8755.54s]  Here we go.
[8755.54s -> 8787.08s]  So many clicks.
[8787.08s -> 8787.80s]  More level up.
[8787.80s -> 8789.00s]  Cluster bombs are accessed.
[8789.00s -> 8794.49s]  You got 3,500 bucks.
[8794.49s -> 8794.89s]  Music?
[8794.89s -> 8795.61s]  I muted it.
[8795.61s -> 8797.50s]  All right.
[8797.50s -> 8798.70s]  I'm done with Minecraft.
[8798.70s -> 8800.86s]  I don't want to hit the Minecraft OST anymore.
[8800.86s -> 8801.34s]  How about...
[8801.34s -> 8814.10s]  Hold on.
[8814.10s -> 8830.34s]  Okay.
[8830.90s -> 8834.86s]  A lot of indecision here but mostly we're going over to here.
[8834.86s -> 8836.78s]  Can't even upgrade them.
[8836.78s -> 8838.62s]  You don't have enough money.
[8838.62s -> 8855.27s]  It's better for you to sleep a little more.
[8855.27s -> 8856.94s]  Thanks.
[8856.94s -> 8859.50s]  I'll do it.
[8859.50s -> 8862.09s]  John, I'm sorry.
[8862.09s -> 8863.37s]  I didn't catch your name.
[8863.37s -> 8864.76s]  Okay.
[8864.76s -> 8865.80s]  Where are you from?
[8865.80s -> 8868.10s]  I'm from the U.S.
[8869.14s -> 8870.10s]  What do you want me to do here?
[8870.10s -> 8871.78s]  I can't do anything with this.
[8871.78s -> 8873.35s]  I'm on holiday.
[8873.43s -> 8874.15s]  I have it selected.
[8874.15s -> 8874.63s]  What do you want to know?
[8874.63s -> 8875.75s]  What's your phone number?
[8875.75s -> 8879.82s]  Could I take your phone number?
[8879.82s -> 8881.02s]  May I have your address?
[8882.57s -> 8883.53s]  Are you on Facebook?
[8885.19s -> 8886.07s]  Who do you live with?
[8887.61s -> 8888.57s]  I live on my own.
[8888.57s -> 8890.01s]  This is a real creepy lady.
[8890.01s -> 8892.54s]  I live with my friends.
[8892.54s -> 8893.34s]  How old are you?
[8894.90s -> 8895.54s]  I'm 30.
[8896.34s -> 8897.22s]  What the fuck?
[8897.22s -> 8898.10s]  When's your birthday?
[8899.72s -> 8900.92s]  It's June 16th.
[8905.53s -> 8906.33s]  Excuse me.
[8906.33s -> 8908.17s]  Do you know where the bookstore is?
[8908.17s -> 8908.73s]  No, I don't.
[8908.73s -> 8909.53s]  I'm sorry.
[8909.53s -> 8911.85s]  How can I get to the train station from here?
[8911.85s -> 8912.35s]  Walk.
[8913.21s -> 8913.93s]  Excuse me.
[8913.93s -> 8915.85s]  Could you tell me how to get to the bus station?
[8916.65s -> 8917.37s]  Ride your bike.
[8917.37s -> 8919.37s]  Can you show me the way to the post office?
[8919.93s -> 8920.49s]  Take a right.
[8921.13s -> 8921.93s]  Excuse me.
[8921.93s -> 8923.37s]  Where is the hospital?
[8923.37s -> 8923.93s]  In front of you.
[8924.57s -> 8925.77s]  Can you show me on the map?
[8926.33s -> 8927.05s]  Right here.
[8927.05s -> 8927.53s]  Look.
[8927.53s -> 8929.45s]  What's the best way to get to the airport?
[8930.41s -> 8931.05s]  Take an Uber.
[8931.05s -> 8933.13s]  What's the fastest way to the airport?
[8933.13s -> 8933.69s]  Get an Uber.
[8934.33s -> 8934.97s]  And it's quick.
[8934.97s -> 8936.25s]  How far is it to the stadium from here?
[8937.29s -> 8937.85s]  15 miles.
[8937.85s -> 8939.29s]  What street is this?
[8939.29s -> 8939.69s]  This is...
[8940.49s -> 8942.25s]  Is this the way to the police station?
[8942.25s -> 8942.89s]  No.
[8942.89s -> 8943.77s]  You're on your way to the...
[8944.25s -> 8945.61s]  Is there a supermarket near here?
[8945.61s -> 8946.01s]  There are.
[8946.98s -> 8949.54s]  Can you give me directions to the gas station?
[8949.54s -> 8949.78s]  Yes.
[8949.78s -> 8951.78s]  If you take a left at the end of this road and you go straight...
[8951.78s -> 8951.86s]  Go straight on.
[8951.86s -> 8952.50s]  Yes, go straight ahead.
[8952.50s -> 8953.22s]  That's right.
[8953.22s -> 8955.06s]  Turn right at the crossroads.
[8955.06s -> 8955.54s]  Yeah.
[8955.54s -> 8956.42s]  Well, no, that's not correct.
[8956.42s -> 8959.22s]  Keep going straight ahead for about 500 meters.
[8959.22s -> 8960.58s]  No, I don't know why you're doing this.
[8960.58s -> 8961.54s]  You asked me for directions.
[8961.54s -> 8962.82s]  The bus station will be on your left.
[8962.82s -> 8963.94s]  Well, that's where you should go, then.
[8963.94s -> 8964.98s]  You should go to the bus station and get on the bus.
[8964.98s -> 8965.94s]  You're going the wrong way.
[8965.94s -> 8967.38s]  I'm not driving a car.
[8967.38s -> 8968.50s]  It's about one mile...
[8968.50s -> 8970.18s]  We are not in a car together.
[8970.18s -> 8974.86s]  What do you do?
[8975.82s -> 8977.64s]  What do you do for a living?
[8978.20s -> 8979.16s]  Online video.
[8979.16s -> 8980.76s]  I've got a part-time job.
[8980.76s -> 8982.09s]  Nice.
[8982.09s -> 8982.89s]  Where do you work?
[8984.41s -> 8985.69s]  I work from home.
[8985.69s -> 8986.33s]  Me too.
[8986.33s -> 8987.21s]  Hey, we got that in common.
[8987.21s -> 8988.33s]  I work in a factory.
[8988.33s -> 8990.33s]  How do you work from home in a factory?
[8990.33s -> 8992.15s]  What is your occupation?
[8992.15s -> 8993.27s]  I work as a doctor.
[8993.27s -> 8995.83s]  I'm looking for a job.
[8997.22s -> 8998.02s]  I'm a teacher.
[8999.61s -> 9001.05s]  I'm not working at the moment.
[9001.05s -> 9002.49s]  Oh, you've lost your mind, Lynn.
[9002.49s -> 9003.37s]  I'm unemployed.
[9004.33s -> 9005.85s]  I do the paperwork.
[9006.41s -> 9008.55s]  I have my own business.
[9010.23s -> 9011.19s]  Do you like your job?
[9011.91s -> 9015.90s]  Yes, it's great.
[9015.90s -> 9017.26s]  I completely agree.
[9018.62s -> 9019.26s]  I agree, too.
[9019.26s -> 9020.62s]  You're absolutely right.
[9020.62s -> 9023.64s]  I agree with you entirely.
[9023.64s -> 9024.52s]  Do what you like.
[9024.52s -> 9025.08s]  Have fun doing it.
[9025.08s -> 9026.28s]  I totally agree with you.
[9026.28s -> 9027.80s]  And, you know, if you make some money, make some money.
[9027.80s -> 9028.36s]  You know what I'm saying?
[9028.36s -> 9029.08s]  I agree more.
[9029.98s -> 9030.70s]  Right.
[9030.70s -> 9031.66s]  Exactly.
[9031.66s -> 9032.94s]  I know, right?
[9032.94s -> 9033.98s]  Absolutely.
[9033.98s -> 9035.18s]  That's what I was trying to say.
[9035.18s -> 9035.90s]  You're right.
[9035.90s -> 9036.54s]  You're right.
[9037.26s -> 9038.06s]  Me too.
[9038.06s -> 9038.62s]  I know.
[9038.62s -> 9039.50s]  That's what I just said.
[9039.50s -> 9040.38s]  I agree.
[9040.38s -> 9041.10s]  Me.
[9041.74s -> 9043.66s]  I see exactly what you mean.
[9043.66s -> 9043.90s]  Yes.
[9044.94s -> 9046.90s]  That's exactly what I mean.
[9046.90s -> 9047.94s]  We both think so alike.
[9047.94s -> 9049.94s]  There is no doubt about it.
[9049.94s -> 9050.58s]  No, there isn't.
[9050.58s -> 9052.42s]  I agree up to a point.
[9052.42s -> 9052.98s]  Up to?
[9052.98s -> 9053.70s]  Hold on a second here.
[9053.70s -> 9054.42s]  Hold on.
[9054.42s -> 9055.78s]  That's partly true.
[9055.78s -> 9056.42s]  No, that's...
[9056.42s -> 9057.86s]  I don't know if I agree with you right there.
[9057.86s -> 9060.14s]  That may be true.
[9060.14s -> 9061.26s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[9061.26s -> 9062.86s]  I see your point, but...
[9063.66s -> 9066.30s]  Well, I don't know how this turned so poorly,
[9066.30s -> 9067.50s]  but I don't agree with you.
[9067.50s -> 9068.62s]  That seems obvious.
[9069.88s -> 9070.92s]  That's a dumb thing to say.
[9070.92s -> 9072.34s]  I'm not so sure about it.
[9072.34s -> 9074.02s]  Yeah, I'm not entirely sure about this.
[9074.02s -> 9074.82s]  I don't agree.
[9074.98s -> 9075.70s]  No, neither do I.
[9076.26s -> 9077.30s]  I don't agree with you.
[9077.30s -> 9078.82s]  I don't fucking agree with you.
[9078.82s -> 9080.26s]  I totally disagree.
[9080.26s -> 9081.54s]  Yeah, you're an idiot.
[9081.54s -> 9082.10s]  An imbecile.
[9082.10s -> 9083.46s]  I'm sorry, but I disagree.
[9083.46s -> 9084.98s]  No, you should not be trusted ever.
[9084.98s -> 9086.02s]  Absolutely not.
[9086.02s -> 9087.06s]  No, you get out of my house.
[9087.06s -> 9087.86s]  How about that?
[9087.86s -> 9089.30s]  I invited you over here.
[9089.30s -> 9091.14s]  You took the fucking bus here, lady.
[9091.14s -> 9092.02s]  That's not right.
[9092.02s -> 9093.06s]  Yeah, and you asked for directions,
[9093.06s -> 9093.86s]  and I tried to give you directions.
[9093.86s -> 9094.90s]  That's not always true.
[9094.90s -> 9095.46s]  No, yes it is,
[9095.46s -> 9096.50s]  because I gave you directions earlier
[9096.50s -> 9097.30s]  and you didn't care.
[9097.30s -> 9098.26s]  Yes, it was what happened,
[9098.26s -> 9099.30s]  so stop fucking interrupting me.
[9099.30s -> 9099.94s]  That's not true.
[9099.94s -> 9100.74s]  That is what happened,
[9100.74s -> 9101.70s]  so stop fucking interrupting me.
[9101.70s -> 9102.50s]  No way.
[9102.50s -> 9103.38s]  Yes, it is.
[9103.38s -> 9105.69s]  You knocked on my door,
[9105.69s -> 9107.05s]  and you asked for fucking directions
[9107.05s -> 9107.45s]  to a bus-
[9107.45s -> 9109.54s]  Do you understand?
[9109.54s -> 9110.82s]  Are you following me?
[9110.82s -> 9113.45s]  Do you understand what I mean?
[9118.20s -> 9121.30s]  Are we ready for the next-
[9121.30s -> 9122.50s]  Are you ready for the next-
[9122.50s -> 9125.27s]  What are we doing now?
[9125.27s -> 9133.72s]  Is this tax or is this go?
[9133.72s -> 9134.28s]  I'm not sure.
[9143.19s -> 9144.39s]  All right, you want this?
[9144.39s -> 9145.43s]  Looks like we're gonna go.
[9145.43s -> 9171.78s]  Here comes the next round.
[9171.78s -> 9172.58s]  This fits pretty well.
[9179.80s -> 9181.40s]  You guys have made an unstoppable team here.
[9181.40s -> 9182.04s]  They can't do anything.
[9182.04s -> 9183.50s]  We gotta go faster.
[9183.50s -> 9184.46s]  Ooh, what happened?
[9184.46s -> 9204.74s]  Pretty good.
[9204.74s -> 9209.61s]  What are we doing now?
[9220.90s -> 9221.54s]  Super Monkey?
[9222.50s -> 9225.02s]  Are we doing Laser 2.0?
[9230.17s -> 9231.13s]  I can really start to follow
[9231.13s -> 9232.41s]  your guys' mindset here.
[9232.41s -> 9232.81s]  It's great.
[9233.45s -> 9239.30s]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[9240.34s -> 9243.05s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[9243.05s -> 9244.09s]  Have people seen Other Monkey?
[9244.09s -> 9244.65s]  There's-
[9244.65s -> 9245.61s]  I can't do Other Monkey.
[9246.41s -> 9247.37s]  This is the only one we can do.
[9253.03s -> 9254.47s]  Okay, make sure we're sure about this
[9255.19s -> 9256.79s]  because I'm seeing some descent here.
[9257.35s -> 9259.42s]  Here we go.
[9260.06s -> 9268.15s]  I completely disagree with you.
[9268.79s -> 9271.74s]  I'm not so sure about that.
[9271.74s -> 9275.13s]  The vessel is starting to turn into a leader.
[9275.13s -> 9275.85s]  It's time to revolt.
[9284.63s -> 9285.03s]  All right.
[9285.67s -> 9288.46s]  You guys got a chance to double check
[9288.46s -> 9289.42s]  to see if you want to do it.
[9289.42s -> 9289.90s]  And here you go.
[9291.48s -> 9292.04s]  Good luck.
[9292.04s -> 9309.43s]  Need to anoint a new vessel.
[9323.80s -> 9325.56s]  This stream keeps getting worse.
[9326.36s -> 9326.68s]  What?
[9329.02s -> 9329.34s]  Why?
[9329.90s -> 9335.37s]  The stream's getting worse.
[9336.17s -> 9343.56s]  I already know what you guys want me to do.
[9353.82s -> 9354.46s]  Plasma.
[9355.53s -> 9357.56s]  Plasma blasts.
[9357.56s -> 9360.36s]  Plasma vaporizes everything it touches.
[9360.36s -> 9362.98s]  That's it.
[9362.98s -> 9364.26s]  I can't afford anything else.
[9364.26s -> 9365.06s]  You guys-
[9365.06s -> 9365.46s]  That's it.
[9365.46s -> 9365.86s]  You're done.
[9382.55s -> 9384.87s]  What is going on over here?
[9384.87s -> 9388.79s]  What is happening over here?
[9388.79s -> 9390.39s]  Why are people losing their minds over here?
[9393.27s -> 9393.83s]  And this-
[9394.47s -> 9396.76s]  37% of you don't agree.
[9403.02s -> 9403.42s]  All right.
[9404.74s -> 9405.22s]  Let's go.
[9405.78s -> 9413.88s]  Look at that plasma ray.
[9414.68s -> 9426.86s]  We've only done five rounds in 30 minutes.
[9428.30s -> 9430.38s]  Because the rounds are getting more difficult.
[9430.38s -> 9431.66s]  They need to have more deliberation.
[9447.02s -> 9448.14s]  Buccaneer, level up.
[9448.14s -> 9452.10s]  Super Monkey, level up.
[9452.10s -> 9452.90s]  56.
[9453.86s -> 9456.26s]  Where to?
[9456.26s -> 9459.18s]  Okay, I can't take this anymore.
[9459.74s -> 9470.49s]  How about epic?
[9470.49s -> 9476.73s]  Put on RuneScape music.
[9487.93s -> 9489.77s]  RuneScape music?
[9489.77s -> 9493.26s]  I've never even played RuneScape.
[9493.26s -> 9494.38s]  It has music.
[9494.38s -> 9501.18s]  All right, here you go.
[9501.18s -> 9506.57s]  All right, looks like Buccaneer.
[9507.13s -> 9521.40s]  I'm gonna refresh it just because everyone was clicking on other stuff.
[9521.40s -> 9522.20s]  Here we go.
[9522.20s -> 9532.30s]  Can we please play RuneScape after this?
[9534.97s -> 9536.57s]  This is it for tonight.
[9536.57s -> 9546.46s]  All right, the people have spoken.
[9549.70s -> 9551.62s]  Three, two, one, bring it up.
[9557.24s -> 9558.12s]  The other one too?
[9558.12s -> 9562.36s]  Longer cannon.
[9562.36s -> 9564.28s]  Three, two, one, here it comes.
[9564.68s -> 9573.43s]  Uh, looks like Super Monkey.
[9573.43s -> 9574.39s]  Which one?
[9574.39s -> 9575.45s]  Could be either.
[9575.45s -> 9577.48s]  I think it's this one though.
[9577.48s -> 9578.84s]  It could be really either one of them.
[9588.54s -> 9589.82s]  Doesn't matter which one.
[9589.82s -> 9595.11s]  This seems to have more votes.
[9595.67s -> 9605.70s]  Are you guys sure?
[9605.70s -> 9612.07s]  Is this Yoshi's story?
[9612.07s -> 9622.12s]  Okay, time to start.
[9622.12s -> 9624.89s]  Let's go.
[9624.89s -> 9644.18s]  Nothing even stands a chance.
[9644.18s -> 9646.65s]  Nothing even stands a chance.
[9646.65s -> 9647.53s]  Did you see that shit?
[9647.53s -> 9649.29s]  Nothing even stands a chance right now.
[9649.29s -> 9649.93s]  It's 57.
[9649.93s -> 9651.37s]  I was at level 60.
[9651.37s -> 9662.58s]  It's just too easy for you guys.
[9662.58s -> 9664.34s]  You guys are making this look simple.
[9664.34s -> 9669.85s]  All right, we're going again.
[9695.38s -> 9696.90s]  Masterfully done, guys.
[9699.59s -> 9703.48s]  Balloon Dissolver for a glue gunner.
[9703.48s -> 9704.44s]  Moab Mauler.
[9705.86s -> 9708.42s]  And rank up Mortar Tower.
[9708.42s -> 9709.83s]  Rank 17.
[9709.83s -> 9710.55s]  There it is.
[9710.55s -> 9712.47s]  So here's the down arrow.
[9712.47s -> 9717.05s]  You get the village, the banana farm, and Mortar Tower.
[9717.05s -> 9719.48s]  Level 58.
[9720.04s -> 9722.78s]  I got faith in you guys.
[9723.34s -> 9729.66s]  Looks like it's split between...
[9731.53s -> 9734.65s]  I feel bad for all the people that want to upgrade the wizard so bad.
[9734.65s -> 9736.33s]  Boy, they have never had an opportunity to.
[9739.02s -> 9740.86s]  All right, we are opening up.
[9741.02s -> 9743.74s]  Ooh, one, two, three, four.
[9743.74s -> 9745.82s]  We got 14, 12, 11, 15.
[9745.82s -> 9748.20s]  Look at all the percentages here.
[9748.20s -> 9753.30s]  Half of the whole entire stream right now does not want to do this.
[9753.30s -> 9754.58s]  But that's what happens, man.
[9754.58s -> 9756.26s]  We got to stick with what we're doing.
[9756.82s -> 9764.23s]  Okay, let's open it up.
[9764.23s -> 9768.26s]  Which tower do you want?
[9768.26s -> 9772.02s]  And again, keep in mind, remember, if you want me to go down,
[9772.02s -> 9774.02s]  you need to select over here.
[9776.58s -> 9776.90s]  Ready?
[9786.17s -> 9786.65s]  Jesus.
[9787.96s -> 9788.84s]  Yeah, over here.
[9788.84s -> 9790.36s]  If you want me to click the down arrow,
[9790.84s -> 9793.34s]  but then we run into another problem where I need this.
[9794.65s -> 9796.17s]  I'm going to have to do this in a different way.
[9799.46s -> 9801.06s]  All right, so it looks like I'm going down.
[9801.78s -> 9804.30s]  But hold on here.
[9808.33s -> 9809.37s]  So let's go down.
[9811.98s -> 9816.30s]  So if you want the village, click up here.
[9817.24s -> 9819.96s]  If you want the banana farm, click up here.
[9820.60s -> 9823.00s]  If you want the Mortar Tower, click down here.
[9823.00s -> 9823.56s]  You understand?
[9824.57s -> 9825.21s]  Go.
[9825.21s -> 9846.26s]  Looks like it's going to be the village.
[9846.26s -> 9847.46s]  By a lot, actually.
[9847.46s -> 9848.74s]  So, all right.
[9848.74s -> 9854.10s]  Where do you want it?
[9854.10s -> 9855.54s]  Where do you want the village?
[9855.54s -> 9857.14s]  Let's see, do we need to zoom in for this?
[9857.14s -> 9860.54s]  We might not even need to.
[9860.54s -> 9863.10s]  You guys want it right in here, but I don't think I can fit it here.
[9864.14s -> 9864.94s]  It's too crowded.
[9869.45s -> 9870.81s]  I could get it right there.
[9870.81s -> 9871.93s]  Let's enhance.
[9871.93s -> 9880.92s]  Where do you want it?
[9880.92s -> 9883.00s]  There's a second Super Monkey though.
[9883.00s -> 9884.58s]  Just be aware of that.
[9884.58s -> 9885.86s]  Below the first Super Monkey.
[9896.09s -> 9897.45s]  The stream will never end.
[9909.27s -> 9917.06s]  All right, right next to the bottom left of the glue gunner.
[9917.06s -> 9924.41s]  That's close.
[9924.41s -> 9925.61s]  That's so close.
[9925.61s -> 9927.21s]  I'm going to refresh it again.
[9927.21s -> 9929.85s]  All right, you ready?
[9929.85s -> 9955.10s]  Go for it again.
[9955.10s -> 9957.98s]  Well, you've spoken.
[9957.98s -> 9959.10s]  It's going above.
[9959.10s -> 9964.84s]  So, right here.
[9965.90s -> 9970.55s]  That's as close as I can get it.
[9970.55s -> 9971.35s]  There.
[9971.35s -> 9984.36s]  Anything else?
[9984.36s -> 9987.88s]  Why is Runescape 07 music playing?
[9987.88s -> 9990.28s]  That's a great question.
[9990.28s -> 9992.12s]  Somebody wrote it in chat and I clicked on it.
[9992.12s -> 9993.24s]  I think we have to zoom in for this.
[9996.15s -> 9997.11s]  Yeah, try it again.
[10012.31s -> 10015.67s]  So, that's the second Super Monkey, right?
[10015.67s -> 10019.29s]  From my understanding.
[10019.29s -> 10027.11s]  So, you guys are selecting the second Super Monkey.
[10027.11s -> 10029.13s]  Or is it the glue?
[10029.69s -> 10044.06s]  All right, if you want this Super...
[10045.10s -> 10046.46s]  I'm going to have to take another picture.
[10047.02s -> 10051.06s]  This is the slowest stream I'm trying.
[10051.06s -> 10051.94s]  It's hard.
[10051.94s -> 10068.49s]  I'm going to have to go more zoom on this.
[10068.49s -> 10069.69s]  All right, show me.
[10069.69s -> 10074.81s]  Remember the Super Monkey.
[10074.81s -> 10076.41s]  There's another Super Monkey down there, right?
[10076.41s -> 10087.30s]  Yeah, there you go.
[10087.30s -> 10090.39s]  A wizard it is.
[10090.39s -> 10093.67s]  After like 30 rounds of people wanting to upgrade.
[10093.67s -> 10096.97s]  There's only one wizard upgrade.
[10096.97s -> 10101.99s]  I'm pretty sure I know which one it is.
[10101.99s -> 10106.22s]  What the fuck did I do to this?
[10106.78s -> 10121.38s]  All right, there's only one wizard upgrade.
[10126.89s -> 10127.93s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[10127.93s -> 10128.73s]  Wait a minute.
[10128.73s -> 10129.45s]  What's going on here?
[10135.58s -> 10136.54s]  Sell the wizard.
[10140.20s -> 10141.00s]  Holy shit.
[10141.00s -> 10148.76s]  Okay, I thought that's surprising.
[10148.76s -> 10149.64s]  Might be strong.
[10149.64s -> 10151.00s]  Yeah, you're right, it might be.
[10151.00s -> 10152.68s]  But not even going to need to see it.
[10152.68s -> 10156.44s]  2250 bucks.
[10156.44s -> 10168.65s]  Where are we off to?
[10168.65s -> 10170.25s]  This seems like a go scenario.
[10170.25s -> 10171.29s]  Round 58.
[10171.29s -> 10193.80s]  Like the Glover soundtrack?
[10193.80s -> 10195.48s]  How do you even know what that game is?
[10195.48s -> 10216.25s]  Is it a video that I made 10 years ago?
[10216.25s -> 10218.42s]  I never made a video on Glover.
[10218.42s -> 10219.22s]  I don't think I did.
[10223.99s -> 10228.17s]  What the hell is happening?
[10228.17s -> 10229.05s]  What was that?
[10229.05s -> 10230.70s]  Why did they go back?
[10230.70s -> 10237.48s]  That was the wizard power makes them go backwards?
[10238.78s -> 10240.54s]  Now I know why everybody wanted to vote for that.
[10244.66s -> 10247.14s]  I'm going to sneeze and I'm sorry about it.
[10247.78s -> 10251.37s]  I have a mute button, I forgot.
[10255.11s -> 10257.43s]  All right, I'm going to turn off the Castlevania 2 music.
[10264.97s -> 10266.01s]  And let's get...
[10268.84s -> 10270.04s]  There's a lot of...
[10270.04s -> 10271.72s]  I don't know what people want in here.
[10279.62s -> 10280.90s]  FTL soundtrack?
[10280.90s -> 10282.42s]  I've never even played FTL.
[10290.01s -> 10292.76s]  Okay, zooming in.
[10296.38s -> 10298.06s]  There's a lot of people clicking here.
[10298.06s -> 10313.93s]  So try it again.
[10313.93s -> 10316.57s]  Looks like we're going over here to the left.
[10321.61s -> 10322.97s]  Doesn't matter which one.
[10322.97s -> 10324.81s]  I can only upgrade the left one.
[10331.40s -> 10334.36s]  So left one it is because the right one cannot be upgraded.
[10334.36s -> 10335.80s]  So left one, which one do you want?
[10344.02s -> 10346.42s]  Flash bomb or double shot?
[10346.42s -> 10349.00s]  Flash bomb is very expensive.
[10349.00s -> 10352.12s]  Sometimes throws a flash bomb that stuns balloons in a large radius.
[10352.76s -> 10358.78s]  Hopefully you spent that money wisely.
[10362.25s -> 10366.47s]  Can't do anything else there.
[10366.47s -> 10367.27s]  Round 59.
[10374.23s -> 10374.87s]  All right, let's go.
[10392.01s -> 10393.77s]  We're going to be here for hours.
[10393.77s -> 10399.56s]  I don't know.
[10403.96s -> 10407.56s]  It could go either way because from 60 and beyond.
[10408.04s -> 10410.04s]  I think is when it's going to start to get actually very difficult.
[10413.50s -> 10413.98s]  We won.
[10413.98s -> 10414.86s]  It's time to stop.
[10416.25s -> 10417.69s]  We can't stop now.
[10417.69s -> 10419.21s]  That would be a huge mistake.
[10432.62s -> 10442.34s]  100% want to go right to the village.
[10442.34s -> 10443.22s]  86%.
[10443.22s -> 10445.14s]  This is probably like 70% right here.
[10445.14s -> 10445.54s]  All right.
[10451.91s -> 10454.71s]  Beacon increased attack range of all towers within the monkey village.
[10455.27s -> 10461.51s]  Okay, where to next?
[10468.15s -> 10469.51s]  Tactical hive mind.
[10474.68s -> 10476.04s]  What is it being clicked on over here?
[10484.55s -> 10489.13s]  My special agent.
[10489.45s -> 10493.70s]  I'm not sure if this is the super monkey or the glue gunner.
[10493.70s -> 10496.86s]  Let me go ahead and zoom it in.
[10496.86s -> 10504.15s]  Which one is this?
[10504.15s -> 10505.98s]  Which one are you clicking on here?
[10505.98s -> 10513.24s]  Glue gunner, okay.
[10513.24s -> 10519.77s]  He is selected.
[10519.77s -> 10532.84s]  What would you like to do with them?
[10532.84s -> 10533.48s]  All right.
[10533.48s -> 10534.60s]  Balloon dissolver.
[10535.82s -> 10537.42s]  $877.
[10537.42s -> 10539.18s]  Don't think this is not about what you guys can do.
[10548.17s -> 10548.57s]  Good luck.
[10555.59s -> 10556.79s]  What is that?
[10556.79s -> 10559.62s]  Okay, that's the super moab.
[10560.18s -> 10565.10s]  The super moab turns into five regular moabs.
[10571.10s -> 10572.46s]  Just decimated.
[10572.46s -> 10573.74s]  Absolutely decimated.
[10574.38s -> 10576.54s]  That could have been really scary, but it wasn't at all.
[10576.54s -> 10577.18s]  Not at all.
[10586.02s -> 10586.50s]  Again?
[10586.50s -> 10587.14s]  Go again?
[10587.14s -> 10587.62s]  Sure thing.
[10587.62s -> 10588.10s]  Let's go.
[10588.74s -> 10605.38s]  This is the coolest tower.
[10609.48s -> 10610.84s]  Getting carried through balloons.
[10611.48s -> 10616.50s]  Hey, look at this shit.
[10616.50s -> 10618.02s]  They can't even do anything.
[10618.02s -> 10620.54s]  Apprentice level up lightning bolt.
[10621.26s -> 10622.62s]  62 of 85.
[10625.80s -> 10626.84s]  4,600 bucks.
[10629.14s -> 10630.98s]  And we are going to...
[10630.98s -> 10632.10s]  Looks like it wants...
[10634.34s -> 10635.70s]  I think this is a living entity.
[10635.70s -> 10639.22s]  Okay, it wants to select the wizard, I think.
[10642.78s -> 10644.06s]  Yeah, this is definitely on the wizard.
[10644.46s -> 10652.06s]  This is probably 70 or 80% of the vote over here.
[10652.06s -> 10655.54s]  And I guarantee it's the zap.
[10655.54s -> 10656.26s]  It is.
[10656.26s -> 10656.98s]  Would you look at that?
[10656.98s -> 10659.70s]  Unleash the power of lightning to zap many balloons at once.
[10659.70s -> 10667.64s]  What else would you like to do?
[10667.64s -> 10669.93s]  Oh, this is getting interesting.
[10669.93s -> 10673.21s]  Okay, now we're buying a special agent.
[10674.17s -> 10674.97s]  Not yet, no.
[10676.23s -> 10676.55s]  Start...
[10676.55s -> 10677.51s]  Looked like it for a second.
[10686.90s -> 10687.14s]  Okay.
[10689.05s -> 10689.77s]  This is...
[10689.77s -> 10691.61s]  Epic range is the only thing to buy here.
[10698.70s -> 10699.66s]  Even bigger range.
[10702.54s -> 10703.50s]  74%.
[10705.46s -> 10706.10s]  73%.
[10707.14s -> 10708.60s]  Okay.
[10716.66s -> 10717.22s]  Anything else?
[10722.70s -> 10723.66s]  Chat sucks.
[10723.66s -> 10723.90s]  What?
[10726.02s -> 10727.46s]  Here's round 62.
[10733.56s -> 10734.36s]  No, I didn't say that.
[10734.36s -> 10735.72s]  I was just quoting what somebody said.
[10748.04s -> 10749.80s]  Music change, I'll do it after this.
[10749.80s -> 10764.17s]  Nothing can even get by.
[10764.81s -> 10767.56s]  This is probably going to go all the way.
[10769.18s -> 10770.62s]  They can't even come down the first lane.
[10772.57s -> 10773.77s]  Excellent placement here, guys.
[10775.88s -> 10776.36s]  For real.
[10777.40s -> 10778.04s]  Nice work.
[10779.78s -> 10781.22s]  Sun god for the super monkey.
[10781.22s -> 10783.46s]  It is said that balloons who doth touch the sun
[10784.41s -> 10786.57s]  shall be cleansed and then there shall be peace.
[10786.81s -> 10787.37s]  Sun god.
[10790.12s -> 10790.84s]  Monkey fort.
[10791.74s -> 10793.18s]  Curses popping power by one.
[10794.86s -> 10797.26s]  And then dartling gun.
[10797.26s -> 10798.30s]  Darts like a machine gun.
[10799.66s -> 10805.46s]  All right, guys.
[10806.02s -> 10808.28s]  What's the plan here?
[10814.44s -> 10816.52s]  66% of you want to go in this area here.
[10817.08s -> 10822.02s]  I'm going to zoom it in.
[10822.02s -> 10823.70s]  Remember the super monkey is down here.
[10824.58s -> 10826.58s]  Click down there if you want to.
[10826.58s -> 10830.87s]  Because I don't know exactly where everyone wants to go.
[10834.30s -> 10836.30s]  And then remember there's a fort up here too.
[10836.30s -> 10840.70s]  You get the missile launch, the fort is up to the top right.
[10840.70s -> 10843.26s]  And then below the first super monkey is the other super monkey.
[10843.26s -> 10844.14s]  Understand?
[10844.14s -> 10846.54s]  All right, make it happen.
[10846.54s -> 10862.47s]  Fort?
[10862.47s -> 10863.51s]  All right, fort it is.
[10865.38s -> 10866.42s]  Fortnite.
[10866.42s -> 10869.18s]  There's only one thing to buy.
[10869.18s -> 10870.62s]  I'm going to assume that's what you guys want.
[10871.26s -> 10877.64s]  It is.
[10877.64s -> 10880.36s]  So this has increased the popping power of all the towers nearby by one.
[10882.68s -> 10884.12s]  1971.
[10884.12s -> 10897.67s]  Okay, pretty good.
[10897.67s -> 10899.51s]  Round 63 incoming.
[10899.51s -> 10902.41s]  Wait, we need new music.
[10904.12s -> 10904.84s]  Okay.
[10904.84s -> 10911.54s]  You guys need to seriously like listen up.
[10915.74s -> 10917.66s]  I want everybody to get up for this one.
[10917.98s -> 10919.02s]  I want you all to stand the fuck up.
[10923.40s -> 10924.04s]  Everyone get up.
[10937.83s -> 10938.79s]  Oh, come on.
[10940.49s -> 10941.77s]  Get it up for me.
[10943.77s -> 10948.20s]  I'll set you down.
[10956.92s -> 10958.76s]  I got four words for you.
[10960.14s -> 10962.86s]  I love this company.
[10962.86s -> 10963.36s]  Yeah.
[10980.46s -> 10981.10s]  Let's go.
[10981.66s -> 10984.86s]  Okay.
[10984.86s -> 10987.50s]  Good work.
[10987.50s -> 10988.70s]  64 out of 85.
[10995.66s -> 10997.26s]  Was that an office joke?
[10998.79s -> 10999.43s]  No.
[10999.43s -> 11040.38s]  You guys have never seen that video?
[11040.38s -> 11040.78s]  Come on.
[11040.78s -> 11044.10s]  It's like original, original meme status.
[11044.10s -> 11047.26s]  Come on, guys.
[11047.26s -> 11048.30s]  And then what?
[11048.30s -> 11058.17s]  I got four words for you.
[11058.17s -> 11066.76s]  Love this company.
[11066.76s -> 11067.72s]  I don't know why I did that.
[11067.72s -> 11070.12s]  I'm not sure what the reason to do that was, but I did it.
[11070.12s -> 11071.43s]  All right.
[11071.43s -> 11072.31s]  Where are we going?
[11072.31s -> 11076.63s]  That is such old shit.
[11076.63s -> 11077.11s]  Whatever.
[11083.91s -> 11084.87s]  Which one are we going to?
[11086.89s -> 11088.89s]  You guys are going to beat this fucking whole thing.
[11088.89s -> 11102.12s]  Looks like we're going right to the glue gunner.
[11102.12s -> 11103.96s]  This is going to take us two hours.
[11108.25s -> 11108.49s]  All right.
[11108.49s -> 11110.97s]  Glue gunner it is, but no, it's not glue gunner.
[11110.97s -> 11112.89s]  That can't, there's no, you can't buy anything.
[11113.53s -> 11126.12s]  Look, glue upgrade is, this path is closed and this one's rank 27.
[11126.12s -> 11132.63s]  I'm sorry, guys, but you can't do that right now.
[11132.63s -> 11137.29s]  Now what?
[11137.29s -> 11137.93s]  Nothing here?
[11139.05s -> 11144.79s]  The only thing that you can possibly do here in this whole area is you got either,
[11144.79s -> 11150.26s]  your options are wizard or super monkey.
[11150.26s -> 11152.66s]  You don't have enough money or enough rank to do anything else.
[11154.55s -> 11160.84s]  If you want wizard on this next refresh, click down here.
[11160.84s -> 11161.48s]  You can do both?
[11162.12s -> 11165.56s]  325, you can do both.
[11165.56s -> 11165.96s]  Okay.
[11165.96s -> 11166.44s]  Okay.
[11166.44s -> 11166.92s]  Okay.
[11166.92s -> 11167.72s]  Okay.
[11167.72s -> 11169.06s]  Okay.
[11169.06s -> 11169.46s]  Okay.
[11171.54s -> 11172.26s]  No, I get you.
[11184.01s -> 11184.81s]  Wizard upgrade.
[11184.81s -> 11185.29s]  There it is.
[11186.73s -> 11187.69s]  And super upgrade.
[11187.69s -> 11191.50s]  But do you guys actually want me to do this?
[11191.50s -> 11200.63s]  You want that second super monkey?
[11200.63s -> 11201.59s]  People are going down here.
[11207.91s -> 11210.07s]  Now that all the people that got their wizard upgrade,
[11210.07s -> 11211.51s]  they're like, no, no, no, no, no, fuck that.
[11211.51s -> 11212.79s]  We're doing an agent.
[11212.79s -> 11218.60s]  That's what happens, man.
[11218.60s -> 11218.92s]  Okay.
[11221.35s -> 11225.35s]  I have no idea what any of this shit is.
[11225.35s -> 11226.15s]  Turtle.
[11226.15s -> 11227.74s]  Bloomsday device.
[11228.30s -> 11228.62s]  Mirror.
[11228.62s -> 11228.86s]  How much?
[11236.54s -> 11237.02s]  Okay.
[11237.02s -> 11237.66s]  Close it.
[11237.66s -> 11238.54s]  Obviously.
[11238.54s -> 11239.50s]  I don't have any money.
[11240.46s -> 11241.98s]  I only have zero dollars.
[11241.98s -> 11248.25s]  You guys found the microtransactions
[11248.25s -> 11249.85s]  and you immediately close the window.
[11249.85s -> 11253.56s]  I love it.
[11253.56s -> 11254.84s]  And that's like, all right.
[11254.84s -> 11257.24s]  You know, I guess we could do the upgrade.
[11257.24s -> 11257.88s]  Okay.
[11257.88s -> 11258.20s]  Fine.
[11258.84s -> 11269.88s]  Round 64.
[11280.92s -> 11282.60s]  Is it just only going to be moabs now?
[11283.24s -> 11295.64s]  Cripple moab.
[11295.64s -> 11296.36s]  Okay.
[11296.36s -> 11303.62s]  That doesn't sound good.
[11303.62s -> 11308.58s]  Let me see the general direction that you guys want to go on this one.
[11308.58s -> 11309.22s]  Let's put on...
[11309.86s -> 11312.66s]  Where's the music?
[11313.54s -> 11314.10s]  I'm going.
[11314.10s -> 11320.44s]  I'm working on it.
[11320.44s -> 11321.00s]  Spore?
[11323.11s -> 11324.15s]  Spyro?
[11324.15s -> 11326.94s]  Katamari?
[11326.94s -> 11327.18s]  I don't know.
[11327.18s -> 11331.00s]  I'm going to play that, by the way.
[11331.00s -> 11333.72s]  Let's get a sneak peek of Katamari Damacy
[11333.72s -> 11335.88s]  because I'm definitely going to play the remade one.
[11343.16s -> 11345.64s]  This has one of the best soundtracks of any video game ever.
[11346.36s -> 11351.53s]  All right.
[11351.53s -> 11352.33s]  Where are we going?
[11352.33s -> 11352.73s]  Over here.
[11352.73s -> 11353.93s]  Right into the...
[11353.93s -> 11354.97s]  We don't have enough money for this.
[11356.60s -> 11357.64s]  Sniper can't be upgraded.
[11359.51s -> 11360.87s]  This can't be upgraded.
[11360.87s -> 11362.47s]  None of this over here can be upgraded, guys.
[11364.82s -> 11366.02s]  You don't have very many choices.
[11372.60s -> 11377.82s]  Your only option to upgrade anything is down the bottom here to the boomerang.
[11380.44s -> 11383.30s]  So try again.
[11383.86s -> 11394.38s]  Here we go.
[11398.25s -> 11398.89s]  65.
[11409.27s -> 11411.11s]  Do not sell the boomerang.
[11411.11s -> 11412.63s]  It's not my decision to make.
[11412.63s -> 11413.03s]  Sorry.
[11413.59s -> 11427.54s]  This is the best song of the whole album.
[11428.10s -> 11429.80s]  This is the best one.
[11493.69s -> 11494.09s]  Did it.
[11494.09s -> 11497.54s]  66 out of 85.
[11497.54s -> 11498.66s]  I am impressed.
[11508.68s -> 11514.92s]  Oh, boy.
[11514.92s -> 11515.16s]  All right.
[11515.16s -> 11515.56s]  We got...
[11520.25s -> 11526.87s]  It's either these people wanting the super monkey upgrade plasma or jungle drums.
[11527.67s -> 11529.75s]  I'm gonna...
[11529.75s -> 11531.59s]  Sorry, all those of you that want to go over here.
[11531.59s -> 11533.83s]  I'm sorry about that, but it's all split over here.
[11535.53s -> 11535.93s]  All right.
[11535.93s -> 11538.41s]  If you want super monkey, put your vote down here.
[11539.93s -> 11541.69s]  Everyone else, do what you were doing before.
[11543.29s -> 11545.29s]  Good luck.
[11557.43s -> 11560.71s]  Looks like we're doing the village.
[11569.02s -> 11569.42s]  All right.
[11570.86s -> 11573.46s]  That's the only up here to do.
[11573.46s -> 11574.34s]  Jungle drums.
[11574.34s -> 11576.02s]  Inspire neighbor Tauzu to attack faster.
[11583.40s -> 11583.64s]  And...
[11587.75s -> 11588.39s]  Oh, shit.
[11590.47s -> 11591.27s]  This is...
[11591.27s -> 11591.91s]  Whoa.
[11591.91s -> 11592.63s]  Hold on here.
[11598.28s -> 11598.76s]  This is...
[11600.31s -> 11601.75s]  I think people want another tower.
[11607.06s -> 11607.46s]  Is that...
[11613.40s -> 11614.20s]  All right.
[11615.16s -> 11616.12s]  Another tower coming up.
[11620.18s -> 11623.86s]  Remember, if you want to scroll down, you got to go over here.
[11635.53s -> 11636.09s]  Holy shit.
[11636.09s -> 11637.37s]  Okay, we're going down.
[11641.16s -> 11643.24s]  So what do you guys want here?
[11643.24s -> 11644.76s]  I need like two screenshots.
[11646.70s -> 11647.50s]  All right.
[11647.50s -> 11651.53s]  If you want monkey village, go over here.
[11652.87s -> 11654.39s]  Monkey village, click up here.
[11657.05s -> 11658.97s]  A banana farm, up here.
[11660.90s -> 11662.58s]  Water tower, down here.
[11666.63s -> 11668.07s]  Dartling gunner, down here.
[11668.89s -> 11671.62s]  And if you want this, then go up here.
[11671.62s -> 11672.82s]  Like actually just put it here.
[11675.78s -> 11677.70s]  So again, just think of it in the corners, right?
[11677.70s -> 11678.74s]  Monkey village, up here.
[11679.54s -> 11681.00s]  Banana farm, up here.
[11681.96s -> 11682.84s]  Water tower, down here.
[11684.70s -> 11685.74s]  Gatling gun, down here.
[11686.54s -> 11688.38s]  And if you want the spike factory, here.
[11691.85s -> 11692.81s]  One, two, three.
[11699.48s -> 11699.96s]  Holy fuck.
[11699.96s -> 11701.16s]  You guys want a spike factory?
[11702.57s -> 11703.69s]  Nobody wants anything else.
[11704.25s -> 11707.50s]  I have 75 IQ.
[11707.50s -> 11709.02s]  These instructions are confusing me.
[11711.75s -> 11712.07s]  All right.
[11712.07s -> 11714.63s]  Looks like we're doing dart spike factory.
[11720.68s -> 11721.80s]  Spike factory it is.
[11721.80s -> 11723.64s]  And where the hell is this even going to go?
[11731.30s -> 11731.78s]  Over here.
[11735.58s -> 11737.58s]  66 of 85, coming up.
[11741.48s -> 11742.68s]  Looks like it's going right here.
[11748.36s -> 11749.16s]  Okay.
[11749.16s -> 11754.50s]  I don't think you have any money for anything else.
[11760.31s -> 11760.79s]  Maybe not.
[11760.79s -> 11761.19s]  Who knows?
[11769.37s -> 11769.69s]  No?
[11769.69s -> 11770.17s]  You ready?
[11770.17s -> 11770.97s]  Okay.
[11770.97s -> 11771.85s]  Pick up 66.
[11772.65s -> 11779.22s]  $2,700.
[11780.10s -> 11795.82s]  You guys really are such gamers.
[11795.82s -> 11796.62s]  I'm shocked.
[11802.94s -> 11804.30s]  Cluster bomb tower, level up.
[11804.30s -> 11807.19s]  67 of 85, you're very close.
[11807.91s -> 11808.63s]  Less than 20.
[11816.74s -> 11818.34s]  Now, some of you want to go,
[11818.34s -> 11819.38s]  and some of you want to upgrade.
[11822.06s -> 11827.02s]  Very conflicted in here of what to upgrade.
[11827.02s -> 11830.31s]  Then I hate to burst everybody's bubble over here,
[11830.31s -> 11844.94s]  but can't afford anything.
[11844.94s -> 11851.03s]  Here we go.
[11851.03s -> 11869.19s]  67, almost at 69.
[11869.19s -> 11870.15s]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[11870.15s -> 11870.39s]  Okay.
[11870.39s -> 11871.19s]  Never mind.
[11871.19s -> 11888.73s]  Attacks super duper fast.
[11888.73s -> 11890.01s]  And super monkey level up.
[11890.01s -> 11892.47s]  Robo monkey.
[11892.47s -> 11893.75s]  Radar scanner.
[11893.75s -> 11896.95s]  These are upgrades that I don't think even half of the people
[11896.95s -> 11898.87s]  that have played this game have ever seen.
[11898.87s -> 11904.23s]  4,800 bucks.
[11904.23s -> 11911.42s]  Should have enough to do a couple things here.
[11913.85s -> 11916.17s]  82% look like they want to go up here.
[11916.81s -> 11919.22s]  That's a large number up here.
[11925.56s -> 11928.57s]  Excuse me, Vessel, please increase volume.
[11928.57s -> 11929.37s]  Increasing volume.
[11930.39s -> 11930.87s]  Job done.
[11934.10s -> 11934.34s]  Okay.
[11939.18s -> 11939.82s]  Yeah.
[11939.82s -> 11940.86s]  Getting the radar.
[11940.86s -> 11942.70s]  Radar scanner allows all towers in this radius
[11942.70s -> 11944.70s]  to be able to detect and target camo bloons.
[11945.74s -> 11946.46s]  Let's hope it's worth it.
[11955.29s -> 11955.93s]  68.
[11964.90s -> 11967.30s]  Oh, big boy, big boy, big boy, big boy, big boy.
[11971.88s -> 11974.22s]  That was nothing.
[11974.22s -> 11974.78s]  69.
[11975.34s -> 11978.95s]  What's the deal?
[11985.99s -> 11987.51s]  Uh, cannon?
[11990.18s -> 11991.46s]  50-50 on the cannon here.
[11997.91s -> 11998.39s]  All right.
[11998.39s -> 11999.43s]  Looks like we're doing the cannon.
[12004.66s -> 12006.50s]  Yeah, that's what people want.
[12006.50s -> 12008.02s]  Attacks super duper fast.
[12015.10s -> 12016.62s]  Excuse me, Vessel, what round are we on?
[12016.62s -> 12019.82s]  We are on round number 69.
[12020.54s -> 12032.26s]  He said it.
[12032.26s -> 12034.50s]  I said the number 69.
[12035.22s -> 12035.94s]  Come on now.
[12035.94s -> 12036.84s]  What the hell is this?
[12039.61s -> 12041.29s]  You're at the final 15, chat.
[12041.93s -> 12044.33s]  Final 15 of Bloons.
[12044.97s -> 12048.01s]  Super hard tower defense map number three in the list.
[12052.97s -> 12054.33s]  Tack shooter upgrade tier four.
[12054.33s -> 12055.05s]  Ring of fire.
[12058.57s -> 12060.01s]  All of the towers have been unlocked.
[12060.73s -> 12061.29s]  You guys are in...
[12061.29s -> 12062.09s]  This is the end game.
[12064.33s -> 12065.93s]  Peter, Peter.
[12065.93s -> 12067.13s]  We're at the end game now, Peter.
[12079.53s -> 12081.21s]  I am actually very, very interested
[12082.23s -> 12085.27s]  in how you guys handle the last 10 rounds.
[12087.14s -> 12088.74s]  There's gonna be a lot of in-fighting.
[12091.35s -> 12091.91s]  New tower.
[12095.96s -> 12096.46s]  Okay.
[12102.07s -> 12103.35s]  Remember, if you want me to go down,
[12104.15s -> 12105.96s]  you know where to click.
[12112.02s -> 12112.26s]  All right.
[12112.26s -> 12115.62s]  For this one, I actually can't say them.
[12115.62s -> 12121.05s]  Tax.
[12121.05s -> 12121.29s]  All right.
[12121.29s -> 12122.65s]  So here's what's gonna happen with this, okay?
[12123.29s -> 12124.17s]  You want me to go down.
[12124.17s -> 12125.13s]  I'm gonna scroll this down.
[12126.36s -> 12130.76s]  But just pretend that this is here.
[12132.15s -> 12132.63s]  You know what I mean?
[12133.27s -> 12134.63s]  Replace all these icons
[12134.63s -> 12135.99s]  with the ones that are in front of you right now.
[12141.03s -> 12142.55s]  So with that being said,
[12142.55s -> 12143.83s]  imagine that it's all scrolled down.
[12144.47s -> 12146.15s]  Just replace the icons on the right
[12146.15s -> 12147.51s]  with the ones that are in the middle.
[12147.51s -> 12147.99s]  Good luck.
[12148.55s -> 12158.14s]  So this is monkey sub.
[12158.78s -> 12159.66s]  It's this one.
[12159.66s -> 12170.34s]  Some of you guys are helping.
[12170.34s -> 12170.74s]  It's great.
[12170.74s -> 12171.14s]  This one.
[12171.14s -> 12175.30s]  Remember, it's this one.
[12175.30s -> 12176.02s]  Okay.
[12176.02s -> 12182.54s]  Monkey's up.
[12182.54s -> 12183.10s]  What do you want it?
[12195.29s -> 12195.85s]  Over here.
[12196.49s -> 12197.21s]  Over here.
[12198.49s -> 12202.28s]  We just need the king of the cosmos
[12202.28s -> 12204.12s]  doing his record scratch talking.
[12212.26s -> 12214.02s]  This is as close as I can get it right here.
[12214.74s -> 12216.54s]  That's right in the middle.
[12217.74s -> 12218.70s]  It can't go on land.
[12218.70s -> 12219.58s]  So it can't go over here.
[12219.58s -> 12220.38s]  It has to go either.
[12220.38s -> 12221.66s]  No, it can't even go over here.
[12221.66s -> 12225.83s]  It has to go here or here.
[12225.83s -> 12229.51s]  Reset it.
[12241.37s -> 12243.90s]  What's going on up here?
[12243.90s -> 12245.10s]  I can't fit it there.
[12245.10s -> 12246.30s]  It's got to be right here.
[12246.30s -> 12252.22s]  The one little spot which is right here.
[12252.22s -> 12260.39s]  This is the only spot it can go.
[12260.39s -> 12265.61s]  I'm putting it down.
[12265.61s -> 12267.13s]  I'm putting it down.
[12267.13s -> 12267.85s]  I'm putting it down.
[12273.03s -> 12273.91s]  God damn it.
[12273.91s -> 12279.18s]  Hold on.
[12279.18s -> 12281.02s]  It's too close.
[12281.02s -> 12283.82s]  Too close to call here.
[12283.82s -> 12299.56s]  Show me.
[12299.56s -> 12300.36s]  All right.
[12300.36s -> 12301.08s]  Right down there.
[12301.08s -> 12301.80s]  You got it.
[12301.80s -> 12309.16s]  It's been placed.
[12309.16s -> 12323.45s]  Thanks for the clarification.
[12323.45s -> 12323.77s]  More.
[12323.77s -> 12324.89s]  What else can we do?
[12324.89s -> 12335.18s]  Can't do anything else.
[12335.18s -> 12336.44s]  All right.
[12336.44s -> 12337.16s]  Final 15.
[12337.16s -> 12338.04s]  Good luck.
[12338.04s -> 12359.27s]  Speed it up.
[12361.03s -> 12363.67s]  I don't even need to see this bullshit.
[12363.67s -> 12364.79s]  This easy mode.
[12370.57s -> 12372.65s]  Super Monkey Fan Club.
[12372.65s -> 12375.91s]  Converts up to 10 nearby dart monkeys into super monkeys.
[12375.91s -> 12377.59s]  If it's an ability, I can't click them.
[12378.23s -> 12379.88s]  Balloon Liquifier.
[12379.88s -> 12380.68s]  Summon Whirlwind.
[12382.94s -> 12383.50s]  71.
[12393.86s -> 12394.50s]  Wizard, huh?
[12398.18s -> 12399.46s]  So many people saw a tornado
[12399.46s -> 12400.42s]  and they're just like,
[12400.42s -> 12401.70s]  give us the tornado.
[12404.38s -> 12405.10s]  You got it.
[12405.10s -> 12405.82s]  Tornado it is.
[12406.38s -> 12413.26s]  Anything else?
[12413.82s -> 12417.61s]  No, I can't do this.
[12417.61s -> 12419.05s]  I don't have the money to do this.
[12419.05s -> 12421.37s]  I don't have the real money currency income thing.
[12428.81s -> 12430.25s]  Bing, bing, bing, bing.
[12430.25s -> 12431.37s]  Lighten up the whole map here.
[12431.93s -> 12435.66s]  Let's go.
[12436.22s -> 12446.92s]  It's a small delay vessel.
[12454.81s -> 12456.41s]  Large piles of spikes per shot.
[12457.05s -> 12458.76s]  72.85.
[12458.76s -> 12459.48s]  Almost in the top 10.
[12469.64s -> 12472.12s]  Vessel music change to Hotline Miami please.
[12475.08s -> 12475.56s]  Sure thing.
[12487.34s -> 12489.82s]  And it seems that we're going to be upgrading the
[12490.78s -> 12492.30s]  spike generator.
[12492.30s -> 12492.94s]  Bigger stacks.
[12492.94s -> 12494.62s]  Generates larger piles of spikes per shot.
[12498.28s -> 12500.74s]  In one, two.
[12501.38s -> 12507.58s]  Okay, 72.
[12508.14s -> 12509.18s]  Wait, hold on.
[12509.18s -> 12509.74s]  No, hold on.
[12509.74s -> 12511.02s]  Just wait a second.
[12511.02s -> 12521.54s]  Okay, let's go to...
[12522.98s -> 12523.38s]  Let's go.
[12527.69s -> 12528.25s]  End game.
[12528.25s -> 12530.01s]  I did not think you guys were going to make it this far.
[12531.05s -> 12536.97s]  I would be visibly impressed
[12536.97s -> 12539.13s]  if you guys actually beat this whole thing on hard.
[12539.93s -> 12556.58s]  All right.
[12556.58s -> 12561.37s]  There's actually quite a few options at the moment.
[12561.37s -> 12572.73s]  He thinks we're incompetent?
[12572.73s -> 12573.77s]  No, I didn't say that.
[12573.77s -> 12574.81s]  I just didn't think this was going to be...
[12575.53s -> 12581.29s]  All of chat is doing this together.
[12581.29s -> 12582.33s]  Absolutely remarkable.
[12582.33s -> 12583.77s]  So you guys want to do plasma.
[12585.69s -> 12587.13s]  Vessel please skip one song.
[12589.24s -> 12594.84s]  Skipping ahead seven minutes.
[12594.84s -> 12595.16s]  All right.
[12595.16s -> 12595.56s]  There it is.
[12595.56s -> 12595.96s]  Plasma.
[12599.53s -> 12614.28s]  No more money.
[12614.28s -> 12615.32s]  Smoothening out here.
[12628.38s -> 12628.94s]  Jesus.

[12705.11s -> 12706.15s]  75.
[12706.15s -> 12729.74s]  Nobody can even match your strength.
[12729.74s -> 12730.38s]  Holy shit.
[12730.38s -> 12730.70s]  Again.
[12731.66s -> 12732.06s]  You sure?
[12732.06s -> 12733.10s]  But we're in the top 10 here.
[12733.10s -> 12734.54s]  You sure that's not a mistake?
[12743.03s -> 12745.99s]  People are starting to feel a little bit of the heat here.
[12752.87s -> 12753.59s]  It's climbing.
[12753.59s -> 12754.07s]  All right.
[12754.07s -> 12754.57s]  Okay.
[12757.38s -> 12759.22s]  That's the sniper you're looking at there.
[12759.22s -> 12760.58s]  So which upgrade do you want for the sniper?
[12761.14s -> 12775.24s]  Semi-automatic or 5-0?
[12785.80s -> 12790.07s]  Look at the percentage of just...

[12814.74s -> 12825.34s]  All right.
[12825.34s -> 12829.03s]  Well, here we go.
[12829.03s -> 12834.34s]  That's out of reach at this point.
[12834.34s -> 12844.52s]  Where to now?
[12844.52s -> 12849.35s]  All right.

[12853.59s -> 12854.71s]  Let the games begin.
[12862.15s -> 12863.11s]  That was five seconds.
[12867.06s -> 12868.02s]  77 of 85.
[12868.66s -> 12879.82s]  Again, be careful.
[12880.54s -> 12883.34s]  Wasn't there a video game that came out with the narrator that had a low voice
[12883.34s -> 12884.94s]  and there was a party of four people
[12884.94s -> 12887.34s]  and they went and they trekked through dangerous dungeons
[12888.30s -> 12889.78s]  and there was a big warning.
[12889.78s -> 12893.14s]  They were bowed over confidence being a very slow, slow bleed.
[12893.70s -> 12895.38s]  Be careful here.
[12903.11s -> 12903.61s]  Uh-oh!
[12904.31s -> 12905.19s]  Is this the end?
[12905.83s -> 12906.79s]  Could this be the end?
[12908.79s -> 12909.43s]  No, no, no.
[12909.43s -> 12911.03s]  That was a little shaky there.
[12917.10s -> 12917.82s]  Oh, fuck.
[12918.38s -> 12918.86s]  Uh-oh.
[12918.86s -> 12919.36s]  Uh-oh.

[12937.32s -> 12938.44s]  78 of 85.
[12938.44s -> 12939.08s]  What are you gonna do?
[12944.47s -> 12944.97s]  Hmm.
[12951.54s -> 12952.58s]  And just like that.
[12957.80s -> 12958.76s]  Oh, boy.
[12958.76s -> 12959.80s]  The indecision here.
[12963.16s -> 12964.92s]  Well, it looks like it's this one.
[12965.64s -> 12966.36s]  Nope.
[12966.36s -> 12967.00s]  It's this one.
[12972.47s -> 12972.79s]  Yep.
[12973.43s -> 12979.45s]  Please select which one it is.
[12979.45s -> 12980.17s]  Or is it both?
[12980.89s -> 12986.55s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

[13023.24s -> 13024.68s]  What am I doing down here?
[13024.68s -> 13025.56s]  What's this for?
[13025.56s -> 13026.60s]  I can't do anything down here.

[16225.08s -> 16236.31s]  that I thought was bad that I got obsessed with um no I don't I don't think so a game
[16236.31s -> 16247.43s]  that I knew was bad but I was I mean maybe I don't know Diablo 3 does that count but that counts
[16247.43s -> 16254.58s]  right because there was a point where I just like hated Diablo 3 and like the position that it was
[16254.58s -> 16259.14s]  in especially like a couple months after launch I thought it was like oh wow this is really
[16259.14s -> 16265.46s]  cool the initial six hours of Diablo 3 I mean the initial like 10 hours or 15 hours was
[16265.46s -> 16271.61s]  like oh this is oh cool cool this is actually kind of fun and then after like I put 50 to
[16271.61s -> 16276.89s]  100 hours into the game after like two months three months of the game being live I hated it
[16280.36s -> 16285.24s]  and that was in the middle of the real money auction house the game was a fucking mess
[16288.14s -> 16296.34s]  no close you guys have you had six percent on the m what's going on there but no what the
[16296.34s -> 16303.05s]  exp the the Diablo 3 expansion uh yeah I gave up on it for a while and then Reaper of Souls
[16303.05s -> 16308.28s]  came out made the game 10,000 times better and then the game I don't think the game at
[16308.28s -> 16313.40s]  this point they've just kind of been tacking on so much shit on top of everything that's already
[16313.40s -> 16321.50s]  there that it's just kind of very there's rift rift rift rift rift rift that's really all there
[16321.50s -> 16327.96s]  is in the game at this point now and for me at least but if that answers your question I

[16993.45s -> 16999.46s]  fighting against it for like I was gonna stream it today but I feel like it's just one of
[16999.46s -> 17016.90s]  those games that's hard to stream everyone is streaming smash I know and I know I know I know
[17016.90s -> 17022.71s]  hard to stream well it's let me put it this way there are games that I like to play on
[17022.71s -> 17027.35s]  stream because I think that a lot of people can enjoy them there are games that I don't like to
[17027.35s -> 17031.27s]  put on stream because I feel like I'm the only one that can enjoy them does that make sense
[17031.99s -> 17051.42s]  sort of because like I'll play through the world of light okay I'm having a great time
[17051.42s -> 17058.02s]  collecting stickers and it can be interesting some of those encounters are have been really
[17058.02s -> 17061.70s]  really interesting and I'm not against streaming a game and playing a game just because
[17062.58s -> 17070.02s]  you know I don't really have any rules for myself on this channel it's just what do I
[17070.02s -> 17073.30s]  feel like doing do I think I can have fun doing it and then do I feel like doing it
[17073.30s -> 17077.46s]  that's been the MO for this channel for like the last three years I mean for instance I'm

[17125.30s -> 17131.70s]  this game or I want to let me do this as like a series no it every single stream except

[17145.18s -> 17148.54s]  the game and activity doesn't matter that much if you haven't fun the stream is fun

[18591.05s -> 18597.21s]  cool no i i've told you guys before that there's a fucking insane amount of people here now
[18598.97s -> 18606.34s]  it's not it's not a secret over the last i'll give you some real numbers here that's just
[18606.34s -> 18617.67s]  fucking insane over the last six months this channel has in six months not even six four
[18617.67s -> 18624.71s]  not even six months like five months received over three thousand subs in the last not even
[18624.71s -> 18633.38s]  half a year and that was on top of what i had before that's fucking insane and especially
[18635.11s -> 18643.22s]  you know that means we're over 5k there are more than five thousand fucking subs on this
[18643.22s -> 18662.44s]  channel and a bunch of these happened in the last like 45 days it jumped up like fucking crazy
[18663.83s -> 18671.64s]  i think since moving to since moving to vegas there i think has been more than two and a
[18671.64s -> 18685.35s]  half to three thousand subs maybe even just since moving it's been an insane amount i did
[18685.35s -> 18691.50s]  a hundred of them last stream yeah i'm not i'm not even counting those so you guys see how
[18693.26s -> 18698.22s]  you know it affects me it does i i want this channel to be fun i want you to care i want
[18698.22s -> 18701.10s]  you to think it's worth paying for and if there are over five thousand fucking people
[18701.10s -> 18708.01s]  paying this stream every month i want this shit i want you to be fucking happy being here
[18708.01s -> 18713.86s]  i want you to have fucking fun and if i get that kind of fucking money i'm gonna i'm gonna
[18713.86s -> 18726.14s]  fucking do that shit i'm gonna try as hard as i can he's gonna cry no i'm not gonna cry
[18733.30s -> 18738.66s]  but this channel even in viewers not just subscriptions or bits or just take a look at
[18738.66s -> 18743.96s]  the view numbers that have happened over the last like two or three months the channel
[18743.96s -> 18751.48s]  has almost doubled in size in three months almost sometimes it potentially tripled in size
[18752.12s -> 18769.82s]  so but that i i don't want that to change the way that i do things i don't want
[18770.98s -> 18776.74s]  uh oh yeah you got 12 000 concurrent viewers a few days ago whatever it was like the last
[18776.74s -> 18782.92s]  week oh yeah you know you get 5 000 fucking subs on your channel i don't want to change
[18782.92s -> 18793.83s]  the shit that i like how i approach things if they were if they were 11 000 people here
[18793.83s -> 18801.21s]  versus 500 i'm gonna approach the streams the same exact way and now if there's more people
[18801.21s -> 18806.94s]  and there's more money coming in just get to i'm just gonna do other shit i'm gonna try to do
[18806.94s -> 18823.67s]  more stuff remember the hitman1 message you recorded for us yeah i yes i do i remember
[18823.67s -> 18829.75s]  that night very very vividly hundreds and hundreds of dollars came in that night and

[18835.72s -> 18854.36s]  hundred dollars given in one stream but that's gonna be the end of tonight i'm probably i don't
