[6.14s -> 24.63s]  Hi. Good to see you. Hope you're having a good day. How are you? I was sleeping. Well, wake up.
[24.63s -> 44.92s]  What time is it? God is here. I am not God. No. You guys remember Bruce Almighty,
[45.56s -> 59.69s]  when he sits down to the prayer email thing, and he presses yes to everybody? I couldn't do it.
[66.90s -> 74.23s]  I love that movie. That's a good movie. You need to grant my wish.
[76.07s -> 84.95s]  What if I did a genie stream where I was a genie and I was granting wishes to people?
[91.88s -> 103.96s]  I feel like... I don't know if that would work. You would dare ignore my prayers? How's your day
[103.96s -> 115.62s]  going? It's going well. It's going really well. I feel like the only thing I would be able to do...
[115.62s -> 122.15s]  No, this wouldn't work because we would have to have people kind of pre-screen their genie wishes.
[122.87s -> 131.40s]  Because realistically, genie, can I have some money? Yes, absolutely. I could give you money.
[132.52s -> 135.72s]  That's the extent of what I can do. I can't really do anything else.
[136.52s -> 144.36s]  Genie, I really need my driveway paved. I guess I could try. What else would I be able to do?
[145.08s -> 154.46s]  I wouldn't be able to do anything else. I guess you could wish for someone to power wash your
[154.46s -> 170.41s]  driveway and I would come do it. I don't think this idea doesn't work. You have to
[170.41s -> 178.01s]  interpret the wishes like a genie does. Okay, so how I would interpret that one? Oh, great,
[178.01s -> 185.61s]  powerful genie, German985. I would love for you to power wash my driveway. Your wish is my command,
[186.76s -> 192.68s]  but then I send you an invoice. It's a service that you're paying for.
[193.48s -> 217.69s]  It's on Groupon. So you being a genie means you just become a contract labor worker.
[218.41s -> 225.62s]  I mean, what else would you do? Oh, great and powerful genie, I wish for you to go
[225.62s -> 233.70s]  down a hill, a big hill in the neighborhood on a sled. Okay, I could probably do that,
[233.70s -> 240.46s]  right? But I couldn't do much else. You could wish for me to... Oh, great and powerful genie,
[240.46s -> 246.39s]  I wish for you to go to David Buster's and have a fun two-hour evening. I guess I could do that.
[247.43s -> 256.89s]  There's not much I can really do. What are these wishes? I have to say, I wouldn't be able to fix
[256.89s -> 264.44s]  very many things. It's like, oh, I wish for this, I wish for that. Oh, Joe, great. You wouldn't be
[264.44s -> 269.00s]  able to wish for world peace or anything with me. I wouldn't be able to do it. I'm not a genie.
[272.86s -> 278.06s]  You can wish for me to power wash your driveway for the stream would be kind of fun, but I don't
[278.06s -> 292.23s]  think I could do anything else. Fake selfish genie. I just don't, I wouldn't be able to.
[296.33s -> 310.73s]  Okay, I wish for emote only mode. Yeah, I could do that. Oh, great powerful genie, I wish for you to
[310.73s -> 317.61s]  end the stream. These could be kind of fun, but that's not really, I mean, this could be fun for
[317.61s -> 324.46s]  like 10 minutes, not for like three hours. Anyways, here's the plan. We are going to be playing
[325.91s -> 330.12s]  House Flipper. Their pets update came out. I want to check it out for a little bit.
[330.84s -> 339.26s]  There's also the possibility to play multi-versus. I got access to the alpha. If I want to play that
[339.26s -> 343.10s]  for a little bit, I can. I don't, maybe I just play House Flipper and we'll play multi-versus
[343.82s -> 347.18s]  soon because I think that is the alpha. I don't think the alpha is permanent.
[355.82s -> 364.89s]  Yeah, the alpha ends in two days. Well, yeah, whatever. I'll figure it out. Alpha ends in two
[364.89s -> 372.95s]  hours. No, it doesn't. Wait, does the alpha actually end in two days? Does it? When does
[372.95s -> 380.36s]  the alpha end on Friday? It ends in two hours. No, it doesn't. Shut up. It does not end in two hours.
[383.67s -> 387.51s]  It's still the 20th. All right, somebody just had a helpful message and it got eaten by the automod.
[388.49s -> 397.35s]  It's on, okay, the 27th. When on the 27th? Why does your microphone sound so weird today? I like
[397.35s -> 401.83s]  it covered it in Vaseline and covered it in like oils and olive oil and stuff. I was trying to get
[401.83s -> 414.73s]  like a nice smoother sound. I don't think it worked. Automod removes all helpful messages.
[416.17s -> 421.69s]  May 27th at 5 p.m. Pacific. All right. So if I don't play it today, then on Friday,
[421.69s -> 436.14s]  I'll play it for like 40 minutes. So that's fine. It's going to be a good stream. I'll play it for
[436.14s -> 446.78s]  like 40 minutes. Whatever. I don't think you guys, nothing helpful was automoded. That's all right.
[446.78s -> 453.42s]  Yeah, we'll play Multi Versus on Friday for an hour and a half, maybe an hour, maybe 30 minutes,
[455.43s -> 467.93s]  or I'll play it tonight if I feel like it. It does look kind of cool though. May 27th. Yeah.
[470.71s -> 477.51s]  Can you do a Street Fighter KO combo? It seems like the game plays identically to Smash Brothers
[477.51s -> 486.07s]  with one kind of major change. It's more team-based, right? You have team recovery moves
[486.07s -> 494.04s]  and stuff, isn't it? Otherwise, it's essentially very much the same game, isn't it? It isn't. It's
[494.04s -> 502.97s]  balanced around 2v2. Oh, okay. I knew that they... No, it's not even close. There's no shields. Okay.
[502.97s -> 516.26s]  Multi Versus is going to be free to play. Oh, that's fine. General, please wish my best friend,
[516.90s -> 522.10s]  my silly fluffball, a happy birthday for the 27th. Please, they are your biggest fan,
[522.10s -> 529.34s]  and it's all they want for their birthday. Happy birthday, silly fluffball. It's me,
[529.34s -> 546.25s]  JerkBot985, Neil's birthday man. It's my birthday too. Happy birthday to everybody's birthday. I
[546.25s -> 553.61s]  can't do them all. Here, if you have a birthday within the next three to six business months,
[554.90s -> 559.30s]  happy birthday to all those May birthdays, happy birthday to all those June birthdays,
[559.30s -> 567.08s]  happy birthday to all those July and August and September and Donor and Vixen, and then we're
[567.08s -> 580.86s]  going to wrap back around and take back the White House. Yeah. There. Did I cover it all?
[580.86s -> 589.32s]  That's an old meme. Do any of you know what that is? Chat's way too young to know what that is.
[590.12s -> 597.99s]  You kind of are. Maybe you are. You are way... That's way too young for... Yeah. Does anybody
[597.99s -> 619.24s]  in the chat know who Howard Dean is? You have to, right? Who? Whatever. Is that the funny scream
[619.24s -> 626.12s]  guy? He didn't even... All right. He went like, yeah. Everybody fucking freaked out. Like what?
[628.31s -> 636.46s]  Really think about that. He became this meme joke guy because he literally said,
[637.42s -> 642.78s]  we're going to go to Michigan and Oregon and I'm doing a pump up speech and we're going to go and
[642.78s -> 649.02s]  we're going to win next time. Yeah. This guy's a fucking Looney Tune. This guy's fucked up.
[650.26s -> 669.80s]  Huh? All he did was cheer. It was absurd. What am I turning it to here? My mic. I know my mic's
[669.80s -> 679.06s]  fucked up right now, but I definitely had time to sit down and fix it. Compressor Andy. Are you like
[679.06s -> 701.16s]  40 years old or something? No, not yet. So what? Hold on. I haven't heard this in a long time.
[702.12s -> 709.05s]  You know something? You know something? We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona
[709.05s -> 714.65s]  and North Dakota and New Mexico. We're going to California and Texas and New York and we're
[714.65s -> 720.41s]  going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan. And then we're going to Washington
[720.41s -> 730.34s]  D.C. to take back the White House. Yeah! But what? Was that that big? Was that that bad?
[732.73s -> 738.73s]  What? Because he has he has like a really great like WWE promotion voice. What? He was just
[738.73s -> 751.66s]  yelling. Is that big of a deal? Boomer humor. All right. Fine. We'll get to the zoomer humor.
[751.66s -> 767.24s]  We'll get to the zoomer humor. Here we go. Hi guys. Hi. What's going on here? All right. So
[767.24s -> 777.62s]  the word this is pets DLC. It's time to flip some houses. I don't. So there's new shit here.
[778.18s -> 788.70s]  Here's my computer. Okay. So I have to do I have to do like the pets tutorial DLC. Okay. Because
[788.70s -> 795.59s]  I can't touch this yet. I also have. All right. I remember this is the house that me and Ludwig
[795.59s -> 802.01s]  when we competed. So I got I can sell a lot of this stuff. I can just sell all this and just
[802.01s -> 809.66s]  get a bunch of money. Are there new pet houses? I don't see any new pet houses. I thought there
[809.66s -> 819.00s]  were more houses. Maybe I do have to unlock them. I think I have to unlock them. It's easy money.
[819.00s -> 823.69s]  Okay. All right. So let's let's just go. Let's do this. This is pet house full of pets. Can you
[823.69s -> 830.18s]  guys hear it? Is it too low? I can't even hear it. Okay. I thought that was it. I thought that was
[830.18s -> 837.86s]  animals. So what is going? What? What? What? This is like one of those children's play mats.
[837.86s -> 846.86s]  Where am I? The training didn't make any sounds. All right. Alice Finbar always wanted to see the
[846.86s -> 849.58s]  world. After graduating from university, she decided to satisfy her one of us. Three years later,
[849.58s -> 854.06s]  while on a motor race, found a hungry and sick bunny. Eventually became her travel mate. Alice
[854.06s -> 858.78s]  has bought her first house recently. She wants to move in with Jesper the bunny as soon as possible.
[858.78s -> 865.29s]  Settling down will be something new for both of them. This is freaking me out. This is freaking
[865.29s -> 870.30s]  me out. I don't know why. Okay. So we have, we have to take care of the bunny rabbit. So what
[870.30s -> 884.66s]  do I have to do? Am I high right now? No. The voice acting. And driven a dog sled in Alaska,
[884.66s -> 890.82s]  but house renovation is not really my thing. This is funny. I've heard you can do wonders
[890.82s -> 896.66s]  and I want my home to be one right now. It's in a worse state than Machu Picchu.
[896.66s -> 901.70s]  What's that? Something more than just my base camp. What's that? A place I can work from,
[902.34s -> 909.14s]  live in, rest. How many animals are in this house? Wait, there's like, why are there tracks?
[909.14s -> 916.70s]  For me and my bunny. And to be happy here too. Let's go out with the old and in with the new.
[916.70s -> 927.40s]  Okay. So I need to do this job to unlock the pet stuff and watch out for that train. Okay. Get rid
[927.40s -> 942.90s]  of that trash. This is a nice house. Is that a, this is pets DLC. Look at this. They added animals.
[942.90s -> 957.08s]  Look at this pets DLC. Why am I still fucking Santa Claus? No, I don't have to do any of this.
[958.94s -> 968.06s]  I actually don't have to do any of this. No, I don't. Wait, remove weeds. Do I really have to
[968.06s -> 982.34s]  do this? All right. I guess I'll remove the weeds. Eat the bugs. Oh, look at that giraffe. This is
[982.34s -> 993.99s]  cool. All right. So just to clean up the trash. Oh, can you step in dog shit in this game? Oh,
[993.99s -> 998.62s]  that's too bad. It would've been kind of funny if it was like, and then you could just walk around
[998.62s -> 1005.42s]  and just track dog shit through the house. Again, I've said, this is a very relevant time for me to
[1005.42s -> 1013.66s]  bring this up. I have to say it again. When was the last time you stepped in dog shit? It hasn't. I
[1013.66s -> 1019.45s]  don't think it's happened since I was probably like 13. It's never happened to me. I don't think it's
[1019.45s -> 1026.98s]  maybe like ever, maybe once or twice ever. Never, right? It's always like such a trope, but I feel
[1026.98s -> 1036.95s]  like it never happens to anybody. Wait, where's my, what are my tools? Oh, I just smeared that
[1036.95s -> 1065.83s]  around. I wouldn't put this on the counter. Is that a fucking owl? Can you hear this? There's an
[1065.83s -> 1077.46s]  owl in here. That's all sounding like fucking toilet sounds. All right. This sounds way too fucking
[1077.46s -> 1097.56s]  high. That's freaky. I don't like that. What happened in here? Why are there bird feathers
[1097.56s -> 1116.15s]  everywhere? It's a pigeon. Well, where? Why did the, is this place, were there like animal parties
[1116.15s -> 1121.16s]  in here or something? Why, there's dog tracks, there's bird feathers everywhere. There's like
[1121.16s -> 1127.78s]  piss on the ground. Were they just hanging out in here? No, that's not, those aren't dog prints,
[1127.78s -> 1148.57s]  are they? What were they doing up here? Okay. I was going to pick up all the trash. What the fuck?
[1148.57s -> 1171.13s]  What's happening? Who's calling me? Why is there a dog up here? Why is there a dog up in the box in
[1171.13s -> 1199.14s]  the attic? Ah, this is going to be my puppy. But do I have, yes, of course. But yes. I can't do that.
[1199.14s -> 1216.33s]  Why does it have a weird hat on? What do I do with the dog now? Um, what am I supposed to do with
[1216.33s -> 1229.18s]  the dog? Uh, you want to sit down over here? Hey, um, you're kind of, you're kind of dirty. How do I
[1229.18s -> 1237.59s]  clean the dog? Do we have to like go to a dog like groomer or something? This, no, that's not how you
[1237.59s -> 1245.14s]  do it. Why is there blood up here? What is this? Use, what's this? Bunnies are very lively animals
[1245.14s -> 1255.83s]  and need a lot of space to have fun. The best option is a free roam room, but sometimes they
[1255.83s -> 1262.78s]  will be safer in a closed one, especially when we have other animals at home or unsecured stairs.
[1262.78s -> 1275.78s]  I don't know. Free roam room, I guess, is what I'm deciding on. Are you okay? Okay. That was just like
[1275.78s -> 1301.67s]  freaked me out for a second. I was like, what happened? Unsafe rabbit room. Unsafe. Really? Um,
[1301.67s -> 1311.34s]  what? This puppy's name is Lassie. Helper, energetic, and is a fussy eater. Okay. So let's,
[1311.34s -> 1327.70s]  um, you want some food? Oh, all right. I want a treat. You actually throw them. Okay. What about
[1327.70s -> 1341.30s]  clean? What is tug of war? Like pet is busy. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[1341.30s -> 1363.62s]  All right. Slow down. Fetch. Oh, go get it. Where'd it go? Will you catch it in the air? I got it. I
[1363.62s -> 1367.93s]  got it. I got it. I got it. Don't go up there. Please don't go up there. All right. All right.
[1367.93s -> 1390.25s]  Let me see it. All right. Fetch. Wait, how many things can I use? Will they catch it? You all
[1390.25s -> 1407.69s]  right? Are you okay? Now we're going to get rid of these. I need to give you a bath or something.
[1407.69s -> 1412.95s]  Don't, how do I remove these? Just remove it. I don't want to throw it over the fucking fence.
[1412.95s -> 1424.10s]  Okay. How are we doing up here with, uh, with the cleaning? It's good. Looks good. Looks good.
[1424.10s -> 1441.08s]  I clean these, uh, windows. It's good. I, I literally, I would look, watch. I thought,
[1441.08s -> 1448.47s]  okay. So when I went like this, he jumped in the air. He jumped in the air at one time,
[1448.47s -> 1452.55s]  didn't he? He went like this. I thought he was going to jump up and grab it. I don't know.
[1453.11s -> 1458.90s]  Don't be sad here. Just take another one. Look, this is there. They're all made out of like soft
[1458.90s -> 1471.51s]  rubber or something. Ready? See? Look, I thought that he was going to catch it. Do you want this?
[1471.51s -> 1481.72s]  And there we go. Okay. All right. You're good up here. Just be careful. Anything else to clean?
[1481.72s -> 1494.81s]  All right. It's clean, clean. It's going to be nice and clean. The dog can't understand you.
[1494.81s -> 1508.17s]  Come with me. Maybe you shouldn't come down here. It's probably kind of dangerous.
[1508.17s -> 1523.18s]  Look at all this. We're not playing thief simulator. What is it? What even is that then?
[1523.18s -> 1538.41s]  I thought this was a painting. I didn't think it was a rug. Okay. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty
[1538.41s -> 1546.92s]  good. That was an eagle. How many different animals are here? Did you hear that? That was a
[1546.92s -> 1560.95s]  literal eagle. Oh, wait. Where's the dog? How do I call the dog? Should I get the dog like a spray,
[1560.95s -> 1572.63s]  like a spray down or something? Come on down here. Is that, should I go take like a bath or
[1572.63s -> 1580.50s]  something? Go play with the water? I don't know. Follow me. Okay. Follow me. I wonder if this will
[1580.50s -> 1592.14s]  work. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. All right. Well, get over here. Let's go. We're going
[1592.14s -> 1596.68s]  to give you a little bath. What's the temperature outside? It's nice and hot. It's a nice hot day,
[1596.68s -> 1605.43s]  right? Okay. Here we go. Do you want to, do you want some of this? Do you want to play with them?
[1605.43s -> 1611.38s]  Okay. There's a fucking bald eagle in this neighborhood. Like this, this is freaking me
[1611.38s -> 1624.06s]  out. There's a bald eagle here. Okay. Should I do this? We think this is like fun. How do I
[1624.06s -> 1641.40s]  wash the dog? I don't think this works. I don't like the fact that you're over here. I don't,
[1641.40s -> 1648.12s]  I don't like this. I don't like the fact that there's a fucking train over here.
[1648.12s -> 1657.58s]  No, you're going to the house. Uh, uh, put them in the bathtub. All right. Well, first of all,
[1658.14s -> 1680.07s]  let me figure. All right. I'm almost done with the cleaning. Oh, come here. This way. No. What
[1680.07s -> 1693.61s]  am I? How do I? Okay. Well, just be careful. How are we looking? We look pretty clean. Is there
[1693.61s -> 1703.53s]  a basement? They're probably, this is pretty clean already. What else is dirty? Oh, you want
[1703.53s -> 1718.02s]  the other stuff. Okay. So you want a magna leather soft, magna leather left corner sofa, 1500 bucks.
[1720.65s -> 1742.44s]  Actually, this thing's huge. Okay. Jell-o coffee table and, uh, pom-pompa's grass. There you go.
[1742.44s -> 1760.52s]  Here, boy. Here, boy. All right. Let's go. The boring color. It's a girl. Oh shit. Here, girl.
[1760.52s -> 1781.75s]  Close the front door. All right. So now what do I unlock? What do I unlock? The eagle is going to
[1781.75s -> 1798.38s]  get her. Oh, this is our house. No, no, no, no. This can't be our house. Wait, you have a, you,
[1798.38s -> 1807.45s]  oh, food. This place is a fucking dump. I need to fix this place up. No, no,
[1807.45s -> 1814.44s]  filled with more food. No, stop. No, no, no. Don't eat that. Don't eat this. Get rid of this. How do
[1814.44s -> 1829.40s]  I get rid of this? All right. How you doing? You okay? How about with water? Does that look good?
[1829.40s -> 1838.09s]  You okay? I need a dog bed. Next to cement bags. This is fucked up. This is fucked up. Okay. This
[1838.09s -> 1846.76s]  is really not okay. This is not okay. Get rid of this shit. I can't have my precious puppy here.
[1854.76s -> 1865.54s]  Get rid of this. We'll get a, we'll get to a better house. This is dangerous. Okay. It's not,
[1865.54s -> 1873.02s]  it's not dangerous over here anymore. Okay. That looks fine. All right. All right. All right. I
[1873.02s -> 1883.98s]  just want to get all the immediate problems over here. Okay. All right. That's cool. Needs hygiene.
[1883.98s -> 1897.22s]  How do I do that? What, what do I, is there really like a dog hygiene thing? Dog, dog chew toy,

[1929.96s -> 1960.46s]  a little more gently? Wow. Look at the difference. Okay. Here, have a treat. Oh, I just threw it away.
[1962.49s -> 1981.35s]  Have a treat. No, come out of the, no, get out of there. Look at, she's so cute. Okay. Go right here

[1992.79s -> 2007.98s]  You want some water? Come on, please. I want to hear it. Nice. Okay. So you, are you okay? You just
[2007.98s -> 2014.57s]  sit here by yourself. These, all right. These birds are fucking annoying. I'm just going to be
[2014.57s -> 2025.42s]  honest. I feel like they're in my head and why are there, what kind of bird is that? Why are there
[2025.42s -> 2038.34s]  tropical birds here? All right. I'm going to, let's, where's the laptop? What birds? You know,
[2038.34s -> 2059.77s]  how do you not hear the birds? All right. Where's the laptop? Okay. Morgan's pet care. Bunnies,
[2059.77s -> 2067.85s]  rodents, reptiles. You mean to tell me that I could have just a house full of birds, reptiles,
[2067.85s -> 2083.58s]  snakes and spiders? Hold on. Can I just have like a hundred spiders? No, I can't. All right. But wait
[2083.58s -> 2102.42s]  a minute. Okay. Snakes. Should I make a snake house? How about a bird house? Does it have parrots
[2102.42s -> 2136.68s]  everywhere? Oh, look at the cats. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. A little Bengal. A Norwegian. Bragg doll.
[2136.68s -> 2148.12s]  How about a little Bengal? But wait, what's the pet hotel? Pets at home. Oh, find a new, move to
[2148.12s -> 2162.26s]  hotel. Pet hotel. What's the tutorial? I can't fucking think of the birds. Okay. Choose an
[2162.26s -> 2167.26s]  enclosure for small animals. You have a, there's a pet panel. You have pets and jobs. You can take
[2167.26s -> 2173.99s]  cats and dogs on a job with you. Okay. You'll pet, we'll get a hat, which will turn off its needs.
[2173.99s -> 2180.78s]  It's magic. That's cool. Different traits. Different. Okay. The helper traits. Oh, they can, they can
[2180.78s -> 2189.14s]  help. Don't put your mouth in that. It'll dig holes when needed and can carry the paint for you.
[2189.14s -> 2206.86s]  Okay. Playing, feeding, sleep, bath time, going potty. The pet hotel. All right. So they can,
[2206.86s -> 2215.94s]  I get it. I need a place to go first. So let's go back and let me see the browser for purchase.
[2215.94s -> 2226.42s]  All right. Here we go. There's this house here. I can buy this. The blue snuggery. This is the house
[2226.42s -> 2231.91s]  I was just at. All right. I'm going to go, I'm going to go sell some of these houses that I don't
[2231.91s -> 2241.24s]  really want. Fix up your house first. That can be my house. Watch. I'm just going to sell this. Watch
[2241.24s -> 2257.69s]  this. I'm literally, I'm going to sell this place right now. Yeah. Just we're selling this right now.
[2257.69s -> 2271.64s]  Sell. Sell as is. Nah, you can do better than that. I want at least what I paid for it. I want at
[2271.64s -> 2282.70s]  least what I paid for it. At least 150. That's fine. I can negotiate. Now that's all right. I'll
[2282.70s -> 2293.94s]  take it. I'll negotiate a little bit though. I want another five grand. All right. There we go.
[2293.94s -> 2302.46s]  Yeah. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Appreciate it. Accept the offer. I didn't do anything to
[2302.46s -> 2322.95s]  this house. I didn't even care. Holy shit. These are not the photos you want to put on the Realtor
[2322.95s -> 2340.02s]  website, but it's all right. I sold it. Art of the deal. Now let's, ah, this is like so, I hate this.
[2340.02s -> 2346.68s]  We're not staying here though. I'm moving to another house. The microphone shadow makes it
[2346.68s -> 2351.29s]  look like you have a black eye. Whatever. Okay. All right. Now we're going to go sell the other
[2351.29s -> 2361.18s]  house. Is there a stain on your webcam? No, it's a shadow and there's gunk in my ear or something
[2361.18s -> 2377.43s]  because it feels weird in there. What was that? Okay. Browse. Um, this is the man cave. I'm just
[2377.43s -> 2400.15s]  going to sell it. I don't even know what this is. Sell it. $268,000. I just want what I paid for it.
[2400.15s -> 2407.40s]  Turn the ambience down. I will. This person wants a sauna in their house. I should have
[2407.40s -> 2418.34s]  sold them the other ones. Okay. $184,000. All right. Let me negotiate a little bit here.
[2418.34s -> 2423.75s]  I'll lose like a thousand bucks. Whatever. Okay. All right. I lost a thousand. It doesn't matter.
[2423.75s -> 2435.05s]  Fine. I just need, I need capital. That's a handshake deal if I've ever seen one.
[2435.05s -> 2449.99s]  It just got a little darker. The time of day changed. That's the only difference.
[2452.17s -> 2471.67s]  Oh my God. What happened to the driveway? I got to sell the, uh, the versus Ludwig house.
[2471.67s -> 2482.71s]  I feel like I might get some good money for that one. I got $450,000 bucks. We're going to do
[2482.71s -> 2486.23s]  another couple of animal jobs because I want to unlock some, I want to unlock some animal houses.
[2486.23s -> 2493.02s]  Okay. Owned. This is where I am right now. So I'm going to sell this one and then I'll buy another
[2493.02s -> 2515.61s]  one eventually here. No more birds, please. I'll fix it in a minute. It's even like still too loud
[2515.61s -> 2535.35s]  at 0.08. We are down to one cent and I can still hear them. Okay. That's fine. That better. That's
[2535.35s -> 2548.68s]  fine right there. All right. So I saw I'm going to sell this house, put it on auction. Oh, this
[2548.68s -> 2563.59s]  is going to be a big profit. I forget what happened in this one. I'll take it. Not bad.
[2567.48s -> 2576.65s]  You took it from the bed, which is weird. Not much change there.
[2579.62s -> 2588.23s]  TV. All right. Good. I got like six or $700,000 now. I got a lot of money. I can take that and
[2588.23s -> 2594.79s]  I can buy a huge like half a million dollar house and I'm going to have snakes. I'm going to have
[2594.79s -> 2606.78s]  spiders. I'm going to have other animals. We're not going to stay here for very long. Oh no,
[2606.78s -> 2622.15s]  you puked. No, that's grass. What did you, what is going on here? What is all this? Oh my God. Watch
[2622.15s -> 2636.09s]  out. Watch out. Watch out. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. All right. We
[2636.09s -> 2641.22s]  got to get out of here. We got to find, we got to get a new place. We got to get a new place.
[2641.22s -> 2646.50s]  All right. What's the, I need to do one more. I need to do another animal job to unlock some
[2646.50s -> 2653.74s]  more animal stuff. Terrified of moles. I don't want the mole to attack my puppy. It looked like
[2653.74s -> 2664.01s]  they were, it looked like he was about to start fighting. Okay. Let's see. We did that one. I want
[2664.01s -> 2677.75s]  to unlock shit. What's this one? Animal caretaker. There is the only one I can do. All right. I can
[2677.75s -> 2694.97s]  do this one. Okay. So what do I have to do? Do I have to help with, oh, is this the animal hospital
[2694.97s -> 2711.18s]  area or something? There is this saying about changing the world. I'm sure you know it. When
[2711.34s -> 2717.02s]  started with myself, now it's time for my home. So what do you need? Structure and order. They
[2717.02s -> 2723.59s]  are crucial for my plans. This is how I see it. Cats and dogs will have their rooms downstairs.
[2723.59s -> 2732.20s]  Got it. The other pets in the attic. Okay. Yes. I know it's such a nice room, but it's worth it.
[2732.20s -> 2737.80s]  It's nothing compared to what they went through. Okay. What so many stray pets experience every
[2737.80s -> 2747.19s]  day? Can't save them all, but a few is more than none, right? Was that, that was a rubber chicken.
[2749.32s -> 2760.31s]  Okay. The animal caretaker. So what's the job? That eagle is going to freak me. I swear to God,
[2760.31s -> 2763.99s]  it's going to come attack me. All right. What do you need? What do you want me to do?
[2764.87s -> 2769.22s]  What are we looking for? This, your house is wonderful. This is a beautiful home.
[2769.86s -> 2777.45s]  What do you need me to do? I mean, you want me to pick up shit and rearrange it and,
[2781.35s -> 2786.54s]  okay. Upstairs, right? Look at all this. Where are all the animals?
[2786.54s -> 2799.11s]  All right. You want this new. Sell the drawers, sell this, sell the whole room, sell everything.
[2799.11s -> 2809.67s]  Okay. That can go. That can go. What else do you need? Picture birch. Yeah. Okay. I could see that.
[2809.67s -> 2819.13s]  Painting of a forest road. Yeah. Okay. So now you want a dog. Oh, this is where the dog
[2819.13s -> 2835.08s]  stuff is. All right. I got you. Dog bed. This is the one you want. Looks good. Right here. No,
[2835.08s -> 2846.70s]  that's too close to the radiator. How about in the corner? That looks good. Okay. We don't want them
[2846.70s -> 2852.25s]  to be too, okay. Like there, that looks all right right there. All right. You want a light under
[2852.25s -> 2861.05s]  bowl mat. That looks fine. Yep. Right there. It looks all right to me. Everybody's going to get
[2861.05s -> 2871.43s]  their own mats to eat and drink off of. Two automatic food dispensers. Yes. House flipper.
[2871.43s -> 2892.02s]  Yes. Okay. Two water dispensers. All right. I'm just doing this to unlock. Rubber chicken,
[2892.02s -> 2907.27s]  chew toy, tennis ball, a big cat tree. Put it right here so they can look out the window.
[2907.27s -> 2917.93s]  Cats really like looking out windows, right? That's all right. Okay. Mouse cat toy. You got it.
[2917.93s -> 2932.28s]  Okay. Okay. One of these over here. Okay. Litter box. All right. That can go right here. Looks
[2932.28s -> 2944.50s]  good. Now I need two of these. All right. That's fine. Right there. Okay. I need a pee pad. There's
[2944.50s -> 2950.68s]  a lot of shit going in this room. Pee pad. All right. I need a pee pants. Put it right. Let's
[2950.68s -> 2966.89s]  put it over. I don't like over here. No, not near the food. Like right here. This needs to move.
[2966.89s -> 2978.71s]  There's toys everywhere. You're messing with the feng shui. All right. Pee pad will go right here
[2978.71s -> 2987.30s]  and then this litter box will go right here. Okay. That's fine. All right. Now this is a dog carpet.
[2987.30s -> 2997.11s]  Really cool. Okay. And then we're going to do a double foot stool or what is this? What's this
[2997.11s -> 3012.12s]  for? What is this for? You can't fit all this shit in this room. Okay. Automatic cat water feeder.
[3012.92s -> 3030.15s]  There's too many. They're all going to be in this room at the same time. What? Dog enclosure.
[3042.76s -> 3088.58s]  Interior dog enclosure. Like this? Just little dividers. That's fine. Put it down. I can't put
[3088.58s -> 3106.22s]  this down. Why? There's so much shit in this room. Oh, okay. It doesn't matter. There's so much shit
[3106.22s -> 3117.51s]  in this room. Breed chat. What? He said the attic too. Use the other rooms. I thought it was...
[3121.42s -> 3128.41s]  The game usually is whatever room you're in, it tells you what to do. That's usually how the game
[3128.41s -> 3132.33s]  works, right? It's whatever room you're currently in. These are the objects that you need to put in
[3132.33s -> 3151.48s]  here. That's how it's been the whole time. Forever. For like five years. Floor tiles. I'll move it.
[3151.48s -> 3162.17s]  It's been like that forever. It's whatever room you're currently in. For the missions, at least.
[3162.17s -> 3173.40s]  Yeah, no. It is this room. See, room 37M2. It is this room. Yeah, I was right. Put the food
[3173.40s -> 3210.33s]  under the mats. All right. Bon appétit. Can I? He can rearrange this however much he wants. There we
[3210.33s -> 3216.73s]  go. Okay. See? That's better. Toys need to go in the corner. This is not even my house. I don't want
[3216.73s -> 3221.58s]  to put that much time into this because I want to do my own. This is not my house. I'm just trying
[3221.58s -> 3226.46s]  to make some money so I can buy my own animal house. If you want to come in here and rearrange
[3226.46s -> 3234.62s]  it, that's fine. You can come in and do it. This is a home designing game. Bro, House Flipper is my
[3234.62s -> 3239.34s]  number one most played game on stream. You don't think I know what I'm supposed... I'm just trying
[3239.34s -> 3257.05s]  to do the missions quickly to be able to buy the house, bro. Now we've got to go to the attic.
[3257.05s -> 3272.54s]  Where are the mats? I just want to do the mission so I can unlock the stuff because I want to make
[3272.54s -> 3285.05s]  my own. I didn't say sell. My awesome entertainment center, dude. Oh, you didn't? Oh, okay.
[3285.05s -> 3298.02s]  Oops. Actually, you did want me to do that. All right. Bunny enclosure. Yeah, it is the same room.
[3298.02s -> 3304.12s]  All right. So we should just go like in the corner over here. I'm thinking it doesn't matter. I'm
[3304.12s -> 3316.52s]  going to do my own. Okay. This is for a... this is for a guinea pig. Whoa. That's huge. Okay. Let's
[3316.52s -> 3326.87s]  put this one over here. Turtle aquarium. I want to do this so bad. I don't care about this other
[3326.87s -> 3333.24s]  person's house. I want a bunch of turtles. I want a bunch of... There's hamsters, too. Hamsters.
[3333.32s -> 3372.47s]  Look at how cool this is. Okay. Furry carpet. A big pantry. Sure thing. And poof. Poof over there.
[3372.47s -> 3377.19s]  Poof over here. And a poof over here. Sounds good. Awesome. All right. Cool. I'm gonna give
[3377.19s -> 3388.14s]  you that money so I can do my own. There was one more down here, right? This is... yeah,
[3388.14s -> 3398.94s]  the house is already pretty nice. What are the rooms? It was downstairs, right? Yeah,
[3398.94s -> 3412.30s]  this room looks like shit. I know. But I... I'm just trying... where do I need to go? The bathroom.
[3412.30s -> 3420.52s]  Bathroom. The upstairs bathroom or downstairs bathroom? Wasn't that the attic that I was just
[3420.52s -> 3431.96s]  in? Yeah, I did the attic already. It's whatever bathroom I just was in. I don't fucking know.
[3431.96s -> 3450.17s]  This is the bathroom. Bathroom? Where is there another bathroom on this floor? You have a
[3450.17s -> 3457.46s]  bathroom in the backyard? No. There's another bathroom. First floor bathroom. Yeah. But how
[3457.46s -> 3476.50s]  come this says 11 meters by second power, not 12? Where is it? Oh, okay. Here it is. All right.
[3476.50s -> 3488.73s]  Let's go. Bathtub plumbing system. I want to get rid of that. All right. Okay. All right.
[3488.73s -> 3500.90s]  Arrange the ceiling tiles. Oh, that's right. You can do ceilings now. Right. That's part of the
[3500.90s -> 3515.38s]  update. You can paint ceilings. You can tile ceilings now. Big update. Big deal. All right.
[3515.38s -> 3523.38s]  I did it. That's fine. I don't need to do anything else. Goodbye. I just... I'm just trying to unlock
[3523.38s -> 3542.89s]  the stuff. I didn't... all that trash. I didn't do that. This dude has no passion in his work.
[3542.89s -> 3548.06s]  I'm... you'll... you want to see passion, you'll see it. Just wait. I think I probably unlocked
[3548.06s -> 3569.03s]  another house. Okay. Browse for purchase. All right. I just unlocked that house. Should I try
[3569.03s -> 3576.33s]  to find another one that's bigger? I think I want a bigger house than that. I want a huge house.
[3576.33s -> 3589.06s]  That one looks all right. No. That one looks... this one looks pretty big. I want... okay. This
[3589.06s -> 3596.07s]  one's huge. This one's huge. And it's right on the water. Let's... let's... let's get this one.
[3596.07s -> 3607.05s]  I need a man-sized house. Actually, this is not that big.
[3607.05s -> 3614.14s]  The inspiration has been hitting me pretty hard lately. My creative spark feels kind of
[3614.14s -> 3623.03s]  damn great out. Colors, fluffy blankets, and lots of cozy furniture. This is what I truly need.
[3623.67s -> 3631.64s]  I always imagined myself in my skelly cutie in a lakeside house with a wooden terrace,
[3631.64s -> 3637.00s]  maybe even a small sauna. Somewhere I would be able to flourish as a writer.
[3637.00s -> 3645.51s]  But I don't... this is not big enough. I could have different houses for different animals.
[3648.15s -> 3664.34s]  And you need a man-sized dinosaur park. This is a huge yard though. Okay. This is a lot of work.
[3664.34s -> 3673.94s]  You can change the stairs. I think this is a lot of work. Oh, this is a... this is big though. Yeah,
[3673.94s -> 3680.25s]  this is big. This is huge. Look at how big this is. There's a lot of downstairs real estate there.
[3684.74s -> 3695.99s]  All right. All right. I think I want this one. I think I want this one. Is it available now,
[3695.99s -> 3703.69s]  or do I have to do the mission first? Build this house with spiders. What do you mean I can't have
[3703.69s -> 3713.98s]  it? Why not? I wonder if it's unlocked. If I have to do the mission first, that sucks. You have to
[3713.98s -> 3725.43s]  clean this whole house. I'm gonna have to clean the house twice. I'm gonna have to clean the whole...
[3725.43s -> 3739.99s]  Okay, I'm gonna do speed run it. I'll speed run it. Okay, I'm gonna speed run it. I'm just gonna do
[3739.99s -> 3754.90s]  the bare minimum. I want this house. I want this house. All right, here we go. Time to speed run.
[3754.90s -> 3805.67s]  Go. Fast. Very fast. Fuck that. I'm just gonna do the... this is gonna take too long. I'm going in.
[3805.67s -> 3820.22s]  There's just shit everywhere. I want to be... I'm gonna have a different enclosures for different
[3820.22s -> 3840.12s]  animals. Okay, looks good. Let's get the broom out here quick. And then I'm just gonna start
[3840.12s -> 3848.26s]  placing objects. Do you want to play the game? That's what I'm doing. I want to just do this
[3848.26s -> 3851.54s]  mission real quick. Because here's the thing. I'm gonna buy this house and I'm gonna have to
[3851.54s -> 3857.24s]  do this all over again. Don't you understand? I don't want to sit here and just waste time
[3857.24s -> 3869.53s]  if I'm gonna have to do the whole thing again anyways. You want this. I wouldn't pick this,
[3869.53s -> 3882.38s]  but that's your choice. I'm just trying to fill the progress meter. Uh-huh. Looks good. You want
[3882.38s -> 3895.16s]  it in the whole thing, right? All right, beautiful. I wouldn't... I don't know. I wouldn't do this.
[3895.16s -> 3902.09s]  Play breakcore. No, it's way too early to do that. It's way too early to start playing breakcore
[3902.09s -> 3916.66s]  during the stream. Just keep... you have to wait a few minutes. I need this. It does not matter
[3916.66s -> 3944.20s]  where the fuck it goes. I don't care. The dump sink that you want. That's fine. Okay. I'm just
[3944.20s -> 3948.76s]  going for completion. Trust me when I say I'm not. This is just to get... so I can get in the house.
[3948.76s -> 3964.94s]  I put the cabinets on the ceiling. I'm... trust me. I know people are like, dude, just fucking play,
[3964.94s -> 3992.33s]  but I have to do this all over again. I feel like I'm a moving company that just brought all the
[3992.33s -> 3997.37s]  shit in here, put it in there, and just left. Wait, I thought... wasn't part of the charge that you
[3997.37s -> 4010.22s]  were gonna help me assemble? Nope. It's like if an AI played the game. It does look like that.
[4012.66s -> 4025.46s]  It does. The AI just knows it has to do one specific task. That's fucking funny. Whatever.
[4025.46s -> 4031.22s]  That progress meter is gonna... this would take like six fucking hours if I were to do this legit.
[4031.22s -> 4037.06s]  Don't you want those six hours to be spent making our own house? Not somebody else's? Don't you get
[4037.06s -> 4049.06s]  it? What is this? Oh my god. Where... can this go in the other room? It can't go in another room.
[4049.06s -> 4076.82s]  Fucking iguana enclosure has to go in here. Oh my goodness. Whatever. I keep running out of room.
[4076.82s -> 4087.35s]  You want two of these? Where do you want me to put them? It doesn't matter. It does not matter.
[4087.35s -> 4102.17s]  Can I put it... this would have taken so fucking long and you all know it. It's sort of taken
[4103.42s -> 4111.50s]  four hours to do all this. You have to trust me on this. Just please trust me. Just please trust me.
[4111.50s -> 4137.61s]  Okay? And you want your TV... I don't care where your TV goes. I really don't. All right. Pretty
[4137.61s -> 4144.87s]  good. Now I should do the rest of the house. This would have taken me fucking six hours.
[4144.87s -> 4158.36s]  Okay. Where's the terrace? Garden. You want me to do all this shit out in the garden? This would have
[4158.36s -> 4183.22s]  taken forever. I will spend time on mine. Okay. This is going to get a lot of progress. Yep. That
[4183.22s -> 4203.10s]  progress meter is going up. Okay. Terrace. Clean the dirt. Do you sound like a Dr. Seuss book?
[4203.10s -> 4219.78s]  What? All right. I need to do... oh this is gonna be nice. Okay. You want these out here. I know
[4219.78s -> 4224.33s]  there's puke everywhere. It's fine. We're just going for progress. Again, I would reiterate a
[4224.33s -> 4246.07s]  million times if I have to. I want a nice hangout zone out here. Okay. Decorative puke. It kind of...
[4246.07s -> 4258.26s]  it does look like decorative puke. You're right. Can you imagine? I thought that cannon just shot
[4258.26s -> 4267.75s]  at me. So you hire somebody to come clean and rearrange your whole house and the whole time
[4267.75s -> 4272.74s]  they're going, I gotta hurry the fuck up. I gotta clean my house. I gotta take care of my house. I
[4272.74s -> 4279.61s]  gotta rearrange my furniture. So they do a half-assed job on your house. That's kind of unfair,
[4279.61s -> 4318.28s]  isn't it? Is this the terrace too? That progress needs to go up. Is this helping? Kind of. Okay.
[4318.28s -> 4334.39s]  Clean that up. I think we're almost halfway there. Get the spray. Close that up. Looks nice. Good,
[4334.39s -> 4341.83s]  good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Clean. How much is the progress of the windows
[4341.83s -> 4361.82s]  giving me, I wonder? That always feels so good. Nice. Okay. Remove weeds. Only 10%. This is really
[4361.82s -> 4377.69s]  dragging the progress down. Yeah, definitely. This shouldn't take too long to get all these.
[4377.69s -> 4401.27s]  Yeah, that's definitely filling up fast. Use the flamethrower? I don't even have it. I think this
[4401.27s -> 4437.91s]  is slower. This is slower. 70, 80%. Let's go. 97%. 98%. Dirt. Where? Okay. All right. We're good.
[4437.91s -> 4457.08s]  There's one here. 99. Just give me the fucking house already. There's a few more windows to clean.
[4461.40s -> 4472.87s]  Watch. New basement entrance. Oh, that went away. That's gone. Okay. Well, sorry. You have no access
[4472.87s -> 4494.90s]  to your house anymore. Very nice. Okay. Halfway there. Can I not climb in through the window?
[4494.90s -> 4521.19s]  You gotta be kidding me. Okay. Here we go. Buy this shit. It's already there. This, this, this
[4521.19s -> 4545.37s]  chair, light switch, three of these, six of these candles. Where's the passion? I don't have any
[4545.37s -> 4550.73s]  passion for this. I need to get to my house. I don't have, what do you mean? I don't have, why?
[4550.73s -> 4557.67s]  I don't have any passion. I have lots of passion for my own space. I'll show it to you. This is
[4557.67s -> 4578.94s]  just to get the money to fucking, he's, there's no passion. I will show it to you. You want to see,
[4578.94s -> 4583.70s]  I will show you passion. I promise. This is going to be a long stream. So don't worry. It's fine.
[4583.70s -> 4589.29s]  I don't know how many they wanted, but that's enough. And then cigars or something. All right.
[4589.29s -> 4594.54s]  Here we go. All right. Cool. Look at that progress. Almost done. There's still some trash that needs
[4594.54s -> 4605.38s]  to come out of this room. Clean that up. It doesn't matter. All right. Let's go in this room. What do
[4605.38s -> 4620.71s]  you want in here? Okay. Here we go. We're good. That's an ugly bed. I'm sorry that that actually,
[4620.71s -> 4643.10s]  I think is an ugly bed. See, I don't care about this shit. It's not my house. How are you supposed
[4643.10s -> 4647.24s]  to fit all this shit? People put way too much stuff in their bedrooms. You know what you need
[4647.24s -> 4657.11s]  in your bedroom? Here's what you need in your bedroom. You need a bed, an end table, a lamp,
[4657.11s -> 4670.70s]  and that's it. And maybe draw like this for your clothes. There's too much shit in their bedrooms.
[4670.70s -> 4677.37s]  You need maybe like a painting above the bed or something, right? Or like on the wall, like over
[4677.37s -> 4682.60s]  here. I don't know. People put way too much shit in their bedroom. Like I don't, I'm sorry. I don't
[4682.60s -> 4686.36s]  want this. I don't want a fucking gigantic tropical plant next to me when I sleep. I just don't want
[4686.36s -> 4691.02s]  one. I feel like I'm just going to get in the way. I'm going to get annoyed by it. Ceiling fans. I'm
[4691.02s -> 4695.51s]  scared of ceiling fans. I feel like I don't want to ceiling people. Oh man, ceiling fans are no.
[4695.51s -> 4698.31s]  Ceiling fans. I feel like they're going to spin and drop and kill me and they're going to chop
[4698.31s -> 4702.95s]  me up in a thousand pieces. I actually think that when I pull the lever and I see a ceiling fan
[4702.95s -> 4709.48s]  spinning, it always freaks me out. I don't like it. I, it's just, I don't know. Sometimes some
[4709.48s -> 4713.82s]  ceiling fans aren't really screwed on all the way and they kind of go like this while they spin
[4713.82s -> 4717.56s]  really fast. And it's just like, that doesn't look, I want that to be secured with a bolt.
[4717.56s -> 4739.13s]  I don't like it. Oh, these are pictures. I was like, what is it on these? That's supposed to
[4739.13s -> 4748.42s]  happen. That's not, no, I don't, I don't like it. I don't care if it's supposed to happen or not.
[4748.42s -> 4755.77s]  I don't want to be looking straight up at a thing that is going like this spinning really fast
[4755.77s -> 4764.17s]  because if I, I'm afraid to close my eyes under that. I don't like it. Something about it freaks
[4764.17s -> 4783.53s]  me out. What can I even put this on? What is this supposed to go on? A shelf or something?
[4784.17s -> 4801.08s]  Okay. There we go. Okay. Almost done. You want the same carpet everywhere. Two of them. Really?
[4801.08s -> 4811.14s]  Why do you want this in your room? This is a swing. You're putting way too much shit in
[4811.14s -> 4820.42s]  your bedroom. That your bedroom for me, I mean, that's a place to sleep. You go sleep. I don't
[4820.42s -> 4836.12s]  want a bunch of distractions and just shit everywhere. Okay. Almost done. And plus we're
[4836.12s -> 4841.35s]  taking down some walls as well. I'm not, this is not the way that I want my house to be. Okay.
[4841.35s -> 4872.90s]  What do you want? Paint the ceiling with lime cream. All right. Okay. Mountable oval bathtub.
[4872.98s -> 4885.45s]  You want these on the wall? Is that what I'm assuming? Yeah. Okay. Here we go. We're almost
[4885.45s -> 4900.12s]  there. Santa's got way more important shit to be doing right now. You guys understand? I think,
[4900.68s -> 4909.70s]  you know what's bullshit? We treat Santa like a Madden release. This motherfucker has to prepare
[4909.70s -> 4916.02s]  Christmas for just a one year. No, no, no. They should, it should be, Christmas should be every
[4916.02s -> 4923.08s]  two years. So Santa has more time to fucking deal with the presents. I think, I don't know. I feel
[4923.08s -> 4927.54s]  like he doesn't have enough time. It takes a whole, at least a fucking year to get the shit
[4927.54s -> 4946.74s]  ready. Santa's not real. Madden isn't real either. What are you talking about? Start, um, start
[4946.74s -> 4949.54s]  timing people off for that. Like, I don't know what the fuck they're talking about. That's annoying
[4949.54s -> 4974.57s]  though. Where does this go? Are you sponsored by Santa? No. How dare you say Madden isn't real?
[4979.37s -> 4982.97s]  Every new Madden game, is it? What are you talking about? All right. We're almost there.
[4982.97s -> 4999.00s]  There it is. Okay. Put it together. Like all the WWE games, all the NBA games, they come out once
[4999.00s -> 5023.06s]  a year and come on, Gwen. I'm sad that the court stream never happened. Me too. That joke is long,
[5023.06s -> 5040.63s]  long dead though. Unfortunately. Okay. What's going to put it over the edge here? One of the
[5040.63s -> 5069.90s]  showers, multiple sink. That's right here. Explain? Um, oh, there's probably a lot of you that don't
[5069.90s -> 5078.58s]  know what I'm talking about or what Chad is talking about either. Uh, years ago, um, I killed Santa on
[5078.58s -> 5088.26s]  stream. Like, I don't know, it was like 2016 or something, 2017. And the joke was I was going to go
[5088.26s -> 5096.71s]  to court for it and get tried for the murder of Santa. And Santa, we were going to have lawyers.
[5096.71s -> 5104.55s]  Santa's lawyer was going to sing all the prosecution. I was going to be up, he was going to be cross
[5104.55s -> 5110.98s]  examining witnesses and stuff and he was going to be singing the whole thing. Um, at the end,
[5111.62s -> 5117.26s]  it was going to be up to you guys if I was guilty or innocent. And the punishment was going to be
[5117.26s -> 5122.22s]  the judge was going to smash the gavel down and say, like, I sentenced you to three Minecraft
[5122.22s -> 5126.07s]  streams in a row. And he's going to smash the thing and everyone's going to freak out. Everyone's
[5126.07s -> 5129.88s]  going to be fucking screaming. Everyone's going to start crying and stuff. Um, and that was going
[5129.88s -> 5134.20s]  to be the joke. And I had to play Minecraft three times. There you go. There's the whole thing
[5134.20s -> 5143.75s]  because there's just no way it's happening. Like ever guilty. Yeah. Everyone would have said guilty.
[5143.75s -> 5154.42s]  There's no way you would have made me innocent. Not even remotely a chance though. Can you just
[5154.42s -> 5165.02s]  play Minecraft for real? No, I can't. I don't play. I can't play Minecraft. I can't. I, every time I
[5165.02s -> 5171.30s]  play Minecraft, especially if I make a video or stream Minecraft, I do the same thing every time.
[5171.30s -> 5177.88s]  I start to build a dirt house. I make a wooden floor. I make a cobblestone wall. The ceiling
[5177.88s -> 5183.70s]  is half cobblestone, half dirt with five to 10 holes in it. And then I go dig down and I make
[5183.70s -> 5187.99s]  what I'm going to say is I'm going to make a mine down here that connects to the bottom of the house
[5187.99s -> 5195.22s]  and then I die at the bottom and I uninstall the game. It happens every single time. I don't think
[5195.22s -> 5202.57s]  I've ever gotten past the making a fully cobblestone enclosed house. I don't think
[5202.57s -> 5211.45s]  I've ever gotten. I've gotten like iron in my inventory. Do you still consider yourself a
[5211.45s -> 5231.29s]  Bostonian? Of course I do, kid. We're so close. And then I can finally start playing. Are those
[5231.29s -> 5257.99s]  lights? I don't know. AI controlled placement. It's right there. Come on. One more. Okay. This is
[5257.99s -> 5269.37s]  almost done. Here we go. Look at that. One more little tick and that's it. I can probably just do
[5269.37s -> 5293.90s]  it by cleaning. Oh hell yeah. Yeah. I can do it by cleaning for sure. Come on. It's right there.
[5293.90s -> 5327.02s]  It's so close. Look at it. It's so dirty. It's definitely going to be it, right? Okay. Come on.
[5327.02s -> 5341.98s]  Finish. Just finish. Destroy the walls. I knew it was going to be so loud. I just, I barely prepared
[5341.98s -> 5353.54s]  for it. I realized what was happening before. There we go. Okay. Which wall do you want me to
[5353.54s -> 5399.26s]  break? Build the walls. Okay. I turned this house into a hidden object game. They didn't even want
[5399.26s -> 5411.45s]  to show you the living room. That's too bad. You should play a hidden object game. I have. Okay.
[5411.45s -> 5427.24s]  Are you ready? Let's go. Here it is. Our cozy haven. Let's buy it. And I want to go there
[5427.24s -> 5434.22s]  right now. Hey, remember all this shit that I just did? Hope you're ready to see it again.
[5437.46s -> 5475.30s]  Why does my camera lag every time? All right. Actually, this is going to go much faster. What?
[5475.30s -> 5530.57s]  I have to buy a new one? That was so much faster. That was so much faster. I'm so glad that I can
[5530.57s -> 5548.42s]  do that. He's looking for a spy. Where is he? And I fly fucking forward. He backstabs me after all
[5548.42s -> 5569.54s]  this bullshit. I finally like get fucking stabbed. Have you seen the save TF2 thing? A little bit.
[5570.10s -> 5581.13s]  A little bit. I'll give my take on it. I would love to see valve. The thing about TF2 is TF2
[5581.13s -> 5588.84s]  is an old game, right? But if there are official valve servers, if you're going to keep official
[5588.84s -> 5594.98s]  servers turned on, I think that they need to support the game somehow, right? And if there
[5594.98s -> 5602.54s]  are official valve servers, valve servers, that means that they're still officially technically
[5602.54s -> 5608.39s]  supporting the game. I would like to see some more updates to TF2. Forget about bug fixes or
[5608.39s -> 5612.95s]  problems with the game or whatever, right? But I would really like to see them at least sometimes
[5612.95s -> 5621.66s]  go in and just kind of fiddle with some knobs, right? That would be great. I don't know. I don't
[5621.66s -> 5629.48s]  know. What is valve doing now? What is valve up to? What's like in the pipeline for valve?
[5631.05s -> 5638.39s]  Steam Deck? The game's currently unplayable right now. Yeah, I just think they kind of need to do
[5638.39s -> 5647.02s]  something, right? So, I mean, I support anything to get and I love that game. I think the game's
[5647.02s -> 5653.24s]  as one as literally the reason why I'm sitting in this chair is because of that game. So absolutely,
[5653.24s -> 5658.97s]  I support them coming in and fixing some of the problems that the game has, especially if they're
[5658.97s -> 5663.19s]  going to officially support it. But on top of that, I would, like I said, I'd like to see at
[5663.19s -> 5669.50s]  least something else or even, I mean, it's so easy to sit here and be like, I would love to do this.
[5669.50s -> 5674.44s]  They should do this. I want the pirate to do this. I want the heavy to get this. But even just small
[5674.44s -> 5682.74s]  little fixes just to support the game. Will they do anything? I don't know. I don't know. I can't
[5682.74s -> 5689.90s]  say that I would expect them to do very much, but it would be nice if they tried to do something
[5689.90s -> 5701.67s]  with the game. But I don't think Valve is really in the business of video game making anymore.
[5701.67s -> 5707.75s]  Video game stuff. They're more hardware related and business related. Steam and their hardware
[5707.75s -> 5715.50s]  shit is, I think, when almost all their focus is completely 100%. I don't know if that's going to
[5715.50s -> 5721.26s]  change. I mean, obviously they're doing really, really well. Steam is the platform for pretty
[5721.26s -> 5726.38s]  much everything. So I don't know if they're ever going to get back into trying to do game stuff.
[5726.38s -> 5730.70s]  Will they actually come out with something besides? I mean, Alex came out a couple of years ago,
[5730.70s -> 5738.15s]  right? But I don't know. The games that they have currently that they kind of are operating as a
[5738.15s -> 5746.07s]  service in a way. I mean, like Counter, they still, what about like CSGO? Dota 2 still gets updates.
[5746.07s -> 5755.96s]  CSGO still gets updates, right? Doesn't, like, CSGO, yeah. Dota 2 is still really supported.
[5764.34s -> 5768.74s]  Yeah, I really do hope that they can at least support the games that they officially have,
[5768.74s -> 5777.45s]  especially official servers for. I guess that's take on it, I guess. I mean, I love that game.
[5777.45s -> 5782.97s]  I love everything about it. That's the huge reason why I am in the position I'm in today,
[5782.97s -> 5791.38s]  because I decided to make TF2 videos fucking 10 years ago. Without those games, I don't think I
[5791.38s -> 5797.82s]  would be sitting here. I really don't think so. Whatever happens, happens, I guess. And I guess
[5797.82s -> 5805.64s]  hopefully they can come up with some kind of solution as I burn this whole fucking place to
[5805.64s -> 5827.82s]  the ground. It should just let the game die. I mean, the hard part with that is if they want
[5827.82s -> 5839.18s]  to just turn it off, then okay, turn it off then, right? If you want to turn the game off,
[5839.18s -> 5845.38s]  and that's it, we're not supporting servers anymore, then at least give some closure to everybody.
[5845.38s -> 5849.46s]  As much as I don't want to see that happen, right? It's almost like, give us some closure.
[5849.46s -> 5854.81s]  Give everybody closure. And oh, hey, look, we're not doing official supported servers anymore.
[5854.81s -> 5858.49s]  We're our focus is in other places. But by all means, if you want to run community servers,
[5858.49s -> 5863.58s]  blah, blah, blah, right? But if you want to pull the plug officially on it, then you got to do it.
[5863.58s -> 5870.55s]  Like, well, closure for what? Closure just for, I think people expect, or not expect, but people
[5870.55s -> 5874.87s]  really want them to be involved, to help and do things and fix things and stuff. But if they
[5874.87s -> 5883.40s]  don't want to, and there's been no real, I guess, communication to do so, then I don't know, right?
[5883.40s -> 5895.74s]  Like, I don't know what their plans or goals are long term, but we'll see. TF2 is the blueprint.
[5895.74s -> 5901.90s]  You've been walking in circles for 10 minutes. Yeah, go watch my Minecraft video. My Minecraft
[5901.90s -> 5907.99s]  videos where I went like this and talked about like what happened at my house today. I literally
[5907.99s -> 5914.62s]  went like this before, I think three or four hours going like this. And when it was brought
[5914.62s -> 5918.26s]  to my attention, I was going to, I think I was going to delete the video because I was embarrassed.
[5918.26s -> 5926.49s]  I was like, holy fuck, what am I doing? I remember MLC Stealth told me long time ago, he said, dude,
[5926.49s -> 5934.46s]  I watched your Minecraft video and you built and took down the same wall for about 12 minutes
[5934.46s -> 5940.52s]  straight. It was, you did it like 15 times. So I just, my brain just gets, when I have talking,
[5940.52s -> 5951.00s]  I can't fucking do anything. All right, let's go. I don't want to buy any, I'm going to buy shit
[5951.00s -> 5966.63s]  little fuel, but I will leave you with this. I do not really play TF2 anymore. I don't, I'm not really,
[5966.63s -> 5973.80s]  I'm not into it anymore, but if you are, then I really hope that some kind of solution can happen
[5973.80s -> 5978.71s]  because it's a great game. It's a fucking fantastic game. It's one of the best FPSs to ever release.
[5978.71s -> 6012.73s]  So time for Smite Sundays. Time for Omega Lull Overwatch Wednesdays. No, I'm not, I'm, no.
[6013.53s -> 6042.12s]  Think of all the bugs in the grass you are killing right now. I'm just trying to get to square one.
[6077.10s -> 6107.59s]  Bug killer. Oh, stop. I'm not, I'm not killing bugs. I checked, I checked before I started
[6107.59s -> 6112.95s]  because there's going to be, it's going to be stuff out here, animal stuff. I got, it's got to be clean.
[6113.59s -> 6158.30s]  Holy shit. That hurt my chest. That's good enough for now. All right, let's clean. Hey, I, come on.
[6158.30s -> 6162.78s]  I was the, I was the master at being able to fake sick so I didn't have to go to school.
[6165.51s -> 6175.21s]  I feel, I just like feel terrible. Oh fuck. Oh, you don't feel good? No, I can't go to school.
[6186.49s -> 6200.81s]  You said fuck to your mom. No, I'm just saying I was, oh fuck. Oh fucking. So as you see here,
[6200.81s -> 6210.54s]  this theory of the triangle and the circle, the Pythagorean theorem is fucking, it's got the angle
[6210.54s -> 6215.11s]  in the middle here you had to solve for that is. Remember that joke? That was a good one.
[6225.54s -> 6234.66s]  I'm going to put new windows on. Don't worry. I need to clean. I remember that. Yeah. So I don't
[6234.66s -> 6255.06s]  have any more water. Where's the, where's my water? Where's, where's water? Excuse me. This,
[6255.06s -> 6262.02s]  I got to change this outside as well. You should play that. Play where's my water. What are you
[6262.02s -> 6292.47s]  fucking an iPad gamer from 2012? What are you talking about? Play iPad games. You know what
[6292.47s -> 6300.06s]  I wanted to do? I wanted to watch a shitload of mobile ads, but we're going to have to do that
[6300.06s -> 6307.75s]  in really small doses because they are insane. I don't think we could do that for three hours.
[6307.75s -> 6319.64s]  I think we would all have, it would make us sick as an avid iPad game connoisseur. Let me tell you
[6319.64s -> 6325.38s]  that some of the most ridiculous, insane bullshit that I've ever seen in my whole life happened
[6325.38s -> 6336.71s]  while I was watching an iPad game ad or a phone ad. You want to talk about a computer generating
[6336.71s -> 6346.09s]  random shit? This is it. But some of them are so goddamn funny. They're so funny that I think it
[6346.09s -> 6377.56s]  deserves a stream night. Okay. I always get it. What's that? Oh, that's a bugs. Didn't I just
[6377.56s -> 6400.66s]  burn this whole room? I thought I burnt this room. Why is there blood? I don't think it's blood.
[6402.14s -> 6412.90s]  I think it's rust or something. All right. This looks fine. I'm now look, I'd look at the passion
[6412.90s -> 6440.20s]  here. You see, see the passion here. There's no natural light. I'm going to put windows in.
[6440.76s -> 6457.13s]  First of all. Nope. Don't want one of those in the house. Front door. Okay. This is the front door.
[6457.13s -> 6468.95s]  Well, that's the side door. Yeah. All of this wood needs to change. Yeah. This all this looks
[6468.95s -> 6478.98s]  artable ceiling fan phobia. I really do with that. They're weird. I don't really don't like them.
[6478.98s -> 6503.90s]  They're weird. No, we're doing it from scratch. We're building this house from scratch. All right.
[6503.90s -> 6507.10s]  How do I want this to play out here? Let's pray. All right. Take all these walls down.
[6507.10s -> 6535.74s]  We're building the house from scratch. Where's the dog? I think at the other house.
[6535.74s -> 6542.15s]  Holy shit. That was inside of my head. This is a load bearing wall.
[6558.26s -> 6562.58s]  Jerry. These are load bearing walls. Whoa. Have you doing a Seinfeld thing where they build a
[6562.58s -> 6575.06s]  house or something? I feel like that. Wait, didn't this happen in Drake and Josh? No,
[6575.06s -> 6581.51s]  it's a load bearing wall, Josh. How was I supposed to? They really are Jerry and fucking George.
[6588.82s -> 6600.02s]  What the fuck? I'm just realizing this right now. How was I supposed to know that a door was
[6600.02s -> 6607.42s]  supposed to be there, Josh? No, other one. Other way around. There's supposed to be a door over
[6607.42s -> 6636.68s]  there. That's George. Holy shit. Damn. Okay. He knows too much. I want another Seinfeld episode.
[6640.07s -> 6647.88s]  You know what I was thinking? In a hundred years, will I know that, okay, like media has a tendency
[6647.88s -> 6654.20s]  to kind of repeat itself, right? Are we going to see in 50 to a hundred years, just Seinfeld,
[6654.20s -> 6663.08s]  but it's they just kind of redoing it. Will there be a Breaking Bad remake in 50 years?
[6663.08s -> 6682.06s]  Do you think so? I wonder. I'm actually genuinely curious about that. All the most popular media
[6682.06s -> 6689.43s]  right now, will they redo it? I mean, Seinfeld ended 20 years ago though. I think, I don't know.
[6690.68s -> 6698.47s]  Maybe like another 50 years, but would they call it Seinfeld and just have some guy that's not
[6698.47s -> 6715.21s]  Jerry Seinfeld just be pretending to be Jerry Seinfeld. They're just going to call it Jerry.
[6715.21s -> 6740.98s]  Okay. I want this. I want, trust me when I say, why are you taking all the rooms out? I'm not.
[6740.98s -> 6747.51s]  When are you going to get remade? See, I'm a, well, see I'm doing all of Jim Carrey's
[6747.51s -> 6765.69s]  sound effects. So like I already am a remake. You know what I mean? Like I am essentially a three
[6765.69s -> 6775.24s]  stoge stooges. Why can't I, I can't talk when loud sounds are exploding in my head. I mean,
[6775.24s -> 6781.08s]  I'm sort of, I am like one of the stooges or all of them combined maybe. Sometimes I feel like Moa.
[6781.08s -> 6791.82s]  Sometimes I feel like, like, not Gary, Curly. Sometimes I wake up and feel like one of the
[6791.82s -> 6822.95s]  stooges each day. Each day. I prefer, I prefer the remake. You're the fourth stooges. Okay. So
[6823.51s -> 6831.40s]  let's get rid of this. I need some light in here because this is what, where even am I?
[6831.40s -> 6842.89s]  Where's the door? Oh no. Drake, you forgot to put the door on. Where, actually, where's the door?
[6842.89s -> 6865.24s]  Oh, I fucking deleted it. Right. I forgot. Where are the stairs? Where is there a door? Okay. This
[6865.24s -> 6899.13s]  is temporary. Where did it go? Oh, what? What the fuck just happened? Oh my goodness. Somebody
[6899.13s -> 6908.14s]  punched me in the face. I got punched in the face. Why is it fucking Walgreens now?
[6908.14s -> 6921.11s]  All right. Just whatever. I am very, very stunned right now. That just stunned me. That was, that
[6921.11s -> 6931.48s]  actually stunned me. I hope everyone's all right. Let's get some lights in here. Jesus. What the
[6931.48s -> 6957.13s]  fuck? Why is caps lock on? Oh, okay. I just need a light. Pools? No. What the fuck is this? Stop.
[6957.13s -> 6968.01s]  I'm concussed. Here we go. Just temporary. Just to get light in here. Where's the light switch?
[6968.01s -> 6988.79s]  Turn it on. There we go. Now I can see. All right. Let's get, let's keep going. I don't know where I
[6988.79s -> 7006.42s]  want the bathrooms yet. We'll get that figured out. Relax. I am getting blocked by this, aren't I?
[7006.42s -> 7033.72s]  It's all right. All right. I hope this doesn't explode anymore. Okay. I cannot take this wall
[7033.72s -> 7040.30s]  down. This is, this is a load bearing wall. You're ruining your house. I am not even beginning it.
[7040.30s -> 7063.42s]  I have not even started. Okay. Good beginning. Um, clean. Let's get this situated. Clean this shit
[7063.42s -> 7078.70s]  up. Let's make this look like, uh, less of a haunted house and more of a animal sanctuary.
[7078.70s -> 7088.44s]  Animal, uh, foster home or something, right? Or to that. Okay. Get rid of that and get rid of this
[7088.44s -> 7097.94s]  and get rid of these. I don't want that. All right. What? This is down to the other floor. Okay.
[7097.94s -> 7105.16s]  We're going to keep, should we get the bugs downstairs? I want, where should the bugs be?
[7105.16s -> 7112.20s]  Where should I put all the bugs? All right. We'll do the bugs later. First of all, I need a bedroom.
[7112.20s -> 7118.52s]  So we're going to have the bedroom be, this is the front door. Is this the front door? Where the hell
[7118.52s -> 7129.83s]  am I? This is the, okay. This is where the front door is supposed to be. Right here. I'll take care
[7129.83s -> 7149.22s]  of that right now. Turn your, turn your sound down. Same shit's going to happen. Turn your sound down.
[7149.22s -> 7173.19s]  I mean it. Thank God I did that. Thank God. That was almost a disaster. There's the front door.
[7173.19s -> 7178.07s]  It's temporary. Don't worry. Everyone calling me a shitty front door Andy. I've seen those comments
[7178.07s -> 7214.87s]  and I, this is greasy. I can't fix it. That's really greasy. Is it still greasy? This shit is
[7214.87s -> 7232.65s]  greasy. All right. Let's clean. I know. Every time these steaks, they're not greasy. And just
[7232.65s -> 7249.75s]  right when you go to the pizza shop, be careful. The pizza's greasy. How fast can you do that?
[7249.75s -> 7275.14s]  Fuck out of here. No one can compare. Not one person. Dominate that market. Okay. Let's do it.
[7275.14s -> 7283.50s]  I need to figure out where I want to put my room. There's no upstairs. I think my, so this is the
[7283.50s -> 7290.17s]  front door. That's the, technically the back door. That could be like a little living room area. This
[7290.17s -> 7297.66s]  front door. You come in, maybe like right over here. I'm going to say I want my bedroom to be
[7298.30s -> 7307.48s]  right here. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, right here. Yeah. I think that's a good
[7307.48s -> 7315.94s]  idea. So let's say from here we can, I don't know, we can just put like a fucking weird clock here or
[7315.94s -> 7373.50s]  something, right? This is the front door. I don't, okay. This is the front door. Bedroom is going to
[7373.50s -> 7402.82s]  be right here. Right here. That looks good to me. Right there. Make a little hallway. Shut up. I'm
[7402.82s -> 7427.27s]  working on it. So you come in. This is a little hallway. There'll be a little, uh, maybe a closet
[7427.27s -> 7449.06s]  right here. Um, but should I have the bed, yeah, the bedroom entrance be here or right here? I feel
[7449.06s -> 7451.94s]  like the door being right there would be weird, wouldn't it? This is kind of a hallway. Then this
[7451.94s -> 7459.08s]  can be the entrance right here. Yeah. I think that makes more sense. Yeah, that makes more sense.
[7459.08s -> 7476.42s]  Looks good. Put a window in there. Yeah, I will. This is fine for a bedroom. Look, I didn't, I just
[7476.42s -> 7480.74s]  need to sleep and wake up and have a light and have like a painting and that's it. I don't care
[7480.74s -> 7494.95s]  about anything else. I need a bedroom door. Ooh. What's a decent door for the bedroom? These
[7494.95s -> 7516.70s]  refrigerators? Okay. This is fine. What color should the door be? Um, how about like a beige?
[7516.70s -> 7543.54s]  Maybe like a birch? These are front doors. Oh my God. Does it really matter though? Luxury? Pets.
[7543.54s -> 7552.60s]  These are the new ones. Let's get some new ones. Okay. Interior door. Here you go. This one looks
[7552.60s -> 7579.38s]  fine. Maybe like a nice, um, like a nice cedar. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Uh, please. Thank you.
[7579.38s -> 7593.78s]  Looks good. Now we have to build the little things up here. This game is so relaxing. Where's the
[7593.78s -> 7602.31s]  passion? I, you don't see the passion in my voice right here. I'm working on it. This is just,
[7602.31s -> 7609.96s]  I want a ton of room for the animals. No window. Yeah. God, I get it. I got to be at lightning
[7609.96s -> 7633.26s]  speed apparently. Where's the bed going to go? We'll do like one here and one. Okay. There's the
[7633.26s -> 7645.24s]  window. Put two windows in here. There it is. Nice. All right. That looks fine. The walls aren't
[7645.24s -> 7650.70s]  going to look like this. Don't worry. In fact, let's figure that out now. Let me get some good,
[7650.70s -> 7674.49s]  good, good lighting, lights. Although I should probably have some cool stuff in here. Why are
[7674.49s -> 7681.74s]  the walls two feet thick? Because that's the way they made the game. Okay. I didn't do that.
[7685.03s -> 7727.42s]  Should I have some weird shit? Oh, this thing look cool. That's fine. Get a dog. I need to
[7727.42s -> 7732.87s]  have this place be available. I need to be okay to have a dog or a cat or a rabbit or a horse
[7732.87s -> 7737.43s]  or a tarantula or an iguana. I'm not just going to bring them in here. It's dangerous.
[7737.43s -> 7743.24s]  It's really off center. I just need the light. All right. Floor. Carpet. Definitely carpets.
[7743.24s -> 7767.46s]  Ooh. How's this look? Looks nice. I like carpets. I like carpets up in a bedroom. I like carpets down
[7767.46s -> 7772.44s]  in the bedroom. I like in a bedroom. I don't know how many times I have to say that for you to get
[7772.44s -> 7783.10s]  it. It's comfortable. It feels nice on your feet. It gets really nice and warm and stuff. I don't
[7783.10s -> 7789.88s]  get this carpet hatred that everybody seems to have. All right. Walls. What do I want this to be?
[7789.88s -> 7806.23s]  I don't care. My bedroom is small. I want more room for the animals. Yeah. Really? I'm not going
[7806.23s -> 7833.86s]  to do that. Cool. But wait. Check this out. People are going to be very... No. I'm not going to burn
[7833.86s -> 7863.26s]  it down. He's making a pet sanctuary. That's what I'm doing. That's the pet DLC. Of course,
[7863.26s -> 7868.20s]  I'm going to make a big pet sanctuary. What do you got? Do you mind? Here's the design.
[7868.20s -> 7881.24s]  This is where the design comes in. Watch this. Check this out, everybody. Okay. Watch this.
[7881.24s -> 7911.74s]  Here we go. There we go. Now it looks like an old Nickelodeon ad. It doesn't work. Oh, I hate it.
[7911.74s -> 7919.21s]  Just an accent wall. Okay. I'll do... Yeah. Something else. I hate it. Let's do paint.
[7919.21s -> 7923.50s]  We'll keep that as the accent wall, though. What should I paint it? Crystal? The Milky Way?
[7923.50s -> 7954.02s]  Let's try the Milky Way. Is it ugly? Too plain? It's a little too plain. Yeah, too plain. I don't
[7954.02s -> 7965.00s]  want to go too crazy, though. How about morning celadon? Fresh morning. Fresh morning would
[7965.00s -> 7985.03s]  probably be good here. Let's test it. I like it. I think it goes with the accent. Oh, yeah,
[7985.03s -> 8009.91s]  this will work fine. Yeah, for sure. It's the same thing. It's not the same thing. That's not...
[8009.91s -> 8016.68s]  Look at it under the light. That's not the same thing. This is way nicer. I am a shadow in the
[8016.68s -> 8037.85s]  dark, okay? I need to... Hold on a second. Hi. You can see me again. This is different and it
[8037.85s -> 8066.84s]  looks much better. There we go. All right. Yeah. Much, much better. It's just gray. I'm going to
[8066.84s -> 8073.82s]  change the carpet, so it's not so boring, but I'm very boring. I swear to God. People think I
[8073.82s -> 8078.94s]  might be making this up. Like, oh man, I bet you he has really crazy taste. I bet you have wicked
[8078.94s -> 8084.12s]  expensive taste and shit. He probably has a chandelier in his house. Guys, I would be so
[8084.12s -> 8092.46s]  happy. At my most happiness. Just sitting in a bedroom that just has a bed, a table, and a lamp
[8092.46s -> 8100.86s]  on it. I don't care. That's at my most happy. I don't want a bunch of shit in the way. I don't
[8100.86s -> 8109.46s]  want a bunch of stuff everywhere. All I need is, yeah, I need my iPad sitting here on my chest,
[8109.46s -> 8133.14s]  a bed, a light, and good company. This door looks like shit. You're an iPad kid. No, I'm not an iPad
[8133.14s -> 8162.38s]  kid. Sometimes Holly will take a funny picture because I fall asleep a lot when I'm with my iPad
[8162.38s -> 8186.36s]  on my chest. In the pictures I'm about to show you, I am asleep. Asleep. One of these in particular
[8186.36s -> 8203.67s]  is really funny. This happens all the fucking time. I just sit there. I have this little thing
[8203.67s -> 8218.31s]  that sits on my chest. Let's go through a couple of these. Maybe one or two of them. Okay, hold on.
[8218.31s -> 8233.24s]  Let me make sure I can get this on the screen. So this is a picture of me. This is the kind,
[8233.24s -> 8245.64s]  I don't know what I was even watching. Auto play just takes over, guys. A lot of the time. Okay,
[8245.64s -> 8255.14s]  that's me asleep. Be aware of that. I am asleep. And apparently I'm watching free money to quit
[8255.14s -> 8270.01s]  your job. I don't know where this came from. Getting rich on government money. I was sleeping.
[8270.01s -> 8274.33s]  It gets better though. It does get better. I promise that this does get a little better,
[8274.33s -> 8288.70s]  and I'm going to show you another one. Don't be, don't, nobody freak out about this, okay?
[8288.70s -> 8310.09s]  But I just have, it's too funny to not show. It really is too funny to not show this. This is,
[8326.04s -> 8343.42s]  and I, I just fall asleep to stuff and I watch stuff. It could be anything. There's more.
[8344.07s -> 8360.28s]  There's more. There's more of these. There's one of, here's the other one. I think this is from the
[8360.28s -> 8371.27s]  same video, but it's just funny. Guys, I'm telling you, I will fall asleep to shit and just, it'll be
[8371.27s -> 8377.64s]  on for six hours and I'll, I will absorb it. I've fallen asleep to six hours. I, oh my God,
[8377.64s -> 8384.50s]  what a perfect opportunity to talk about this. So today, what I fell asleep to as an iPad kid Andy,
[8384.50s -> 8391.78s]  I fell asleep to, I don't know, was a food eating video? One of those videos of people eating food
[8391.86s -> 8399.21s]  and I, I guess I fell asleep and I woke, I kind of woke up because Otto was in the bed and I heard
[8399.21s -> 8405.58s]  like crunching shit and I'm like, Otto's eating something. What's he eating? No, he's not. What's
[8405.58s -> 8409.82s]  he getting into? And I open my eyes and look at the dog and he's fine. He's just sitting there sleeping
[8409.82s -> 8418.44s]  and the audio stopped. There were no more eating sounds. So I was like, what the fuck was that? I
[8418.44s -> 8425.62s]  must've been having like a weird dream. So I didn't care and I went back to bed and I heard it again.
[8425.62s -> 8429.62s]  I heard this crazy eating sounds and I'm like, Otto's getting into like the trash.
[8429.62s -> 8433.86s]  What's happening? And no, it was over here. The iPad was on the other end of the bed,
[8435.02s -> 8444.14s]  just Otto playing shit. And I kept thinking it was Otto eating food in the bed. It had to have been
[8444.14s -> 8448.70s]  going on for at least four or five hours because it was dark when it happened the first time and
[8448.70s -> 8454.54s]  the sun was shining the second time. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I don't know what
[8454.54s -> 8463.30s]  I, what's, I don't know why I keep doing this, but it doesn't matter. It could be anything.
[8463.30s -> 8473.53s]  The YouTube recommendation autoplay is terrible. Here's another one. We'll do this last one.
[8481.05s -> 8495.82s]  I think this is from the quit your job for money thing. By the way, if you want to know who that
[8495.82s -> 8502.42s]  is, that's, that's Matthew Lesko, who he's actually like a really, really nice guy. Really, really
[8502.42s -> 8507.22s]  like awesome, awesome dude. Really just wanted to like help people and shit. He is a great person.
[8507.22s -> 8511.62s]  That little documentary that Vice did is wonderful. I really recommend you watch it. I've seen it.
[8512.10s -> 8517.11s]  I didn't fall asleep to it. I've seen it. It's he's actually, it was actually a really,
[8517.11s -> 8530.18s]  really good guy. All right. You have broken neck. No, I don't. I'm propped up on a pillow.
[8534.95s -> 8549.38s]  I'm propped up on a pillow, man. I'm, that's not a TV. There's an iPad. You have streamer neck in
[8549.38s -> 8559.13s]  your sleep. Sometimes though that's dangerous because I will be like this and I'll move a
[8559.13s -> 8564.65s]  certain way and the iPad will go and start falling down and I'll feel it. And I'll be like,
[8566.01s -> 8572.42s]  I'll grab it and okay. And then I leave it there and I go back to bed. It's move it. Just move it
[8572.42s -> 8579.06s]  off of your fucking body. I do that three or four times a night. I almost get smashed in the mouth
[8579.06s -> 8586.70s]  by my iPad and I don't care. I put it right back where it was. One of these days it's going to
[8586.70s -> 8606.70s]  knock out one of my front teeth. Anyways, this is too funny. I could, I had to share it.
[8606.78s -> 8636.02s]  Ceiling is still wood. I'm working on it. Okay. So it's, is this real? Is this a,
[8636.02s -> 8646.74s]  Holly? Is this real? Is this a real one? Is this real? I don't think this is,
[8646.74s -> 8653.26s]  did I fall asleep to this? I might've. I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know.
[8654.79s -> 8674.38s]  I truly don't know. Why is this image so huge? What the fuck? Where is it? I'm so confused.
[8676.98s -> 8685.45s]  Oh, there we go. Okay. I may, I might've, I actually might've. This is, this could be a real
[8685.45s -> 8695.80s]  photo. I really probably did. Oh, it's not real. It could be. I, I, it actually could be. This is
[8695.80s -> 8700.30s]  no way. That's edited. It's fake. Okay. But it's definitely real because I've definitely
[8700.30s -> 8706.94s]  fallen asleep to watching that video. I'm not even kidding. Like I sometimes it was like eating
[8707.02s -> 8711.74s]  videos and he's like, watch one. I go, whoa, what this, whoa. And then I just,
[8712.70s -> 8730.23s]  and they all play. It's real. I'm serious. I don't know. I, I'm very weird when it comes to media
[8730.23s -> 8734.70s]  and consuming media. A lot of people probably like, dude, what the fuck? Why are you doing that?
[8734.70s -> 8741.16s]  What's wrong with you? I don't know. I like watching odd media, just like interesting stuff.
[8741.16s -> 8748.12s]  I don't watch TV shows. I watched four straight hours of ASMR eating videos. I don't, I just,
[8748.12s -> 8752.10s]  because, because it's interesting. It's very, it's fascinating. It's interesting to me.
[8752.10s -> 8759.62s]  It's interesting. I will watch like four hours of log cutting videos. It's just, it's fascinating
[8759.62s -> 8766.44s]  somehow. It's very interesting. You know what I'm saying? It's ADHD that's doing it. It probably,
[8766.44s -> 8780.14s]  it could be. It actually could be. All right. Can I paint the ceiling please? I think it can
[8780.14s -> 8792.76s]  just be this. This is fine. Now you could paint a wall. Good. Is this the wrong color? No. Is
[8792.76s -> 8802.39s]  this too weird looking? I can't tell. I love doing interior car cleaning videos. Yeah. You
[8802.39s -> 8810.92s]  don't have to watch, you know, oh, the new season of Breaking Bad or whatever. We're just,
[8810.92s -> 8820.73s]  I like watching random shit. I will watch old commercials. It's interesting. Really old
[8820.73s -> 8830.28s]  commercials. I'm happy with this room. I'm done with it. Okay. Now I need a bathroom,
[8830.28s -> 8847.13s]  which would be right here. You missed a spot. I can go to finishing touches later. Bathroom
[8847.13s -> 8855.69s]  can be here. Ooh, the door is going to be close, isn't it? It's fine. Change the weird door.
[8860.04s -> 8874.41s]  It is a fucking weird door. I know you're right. That is a weird door. Maybe I could just have
[8874.41s -> 8888.74s]  like an open concept here. It's probably, it's got to be here instead. Right there. There it is.
[8888.74s -> 8894.18s]  Okay. So the bathroom's right here. Open concept into a bedroom. I don't know. It's just going to
[8894.18s -> 8901.02s]  be, it's going to be me and all my dogs and lizards and shit. I think right, right there
[8901.02s -> 8909.05s]  should be fine. That should be fine right here, I think. What does your YouTube recommended look
[8909.05s -> 8918.38s]  like? It's a, it's crazy. I actually have to go in and delete all of my search history and watch
[8918.38s -> 8924.94s]  history because eventually it gets to be fucking nightmares. It's just crazy, the recommendations
[8924.94s -> 8936.44s]  I get. If I don't reset it, it's just all over the place. Just wild, wild shit from every genre.
[8936.44s -> 8945.46s]  YouTube is fundamentally broken. Show us your YouTube. I'm not, you want to see my YouTube
[8945.46s -> 8961.86s]  searches? Let me screen that first. I'll screen that first. Show us. I don't have to show you
[8961.86s -> 8972.18s]  anything. You need to show us right now. No, I don't have to show you. I don't, I don't know.
[8972.18s -> 8977.00s]  I don't know if you guys know what videos I've watched. It's freaking me out because I'm not
[8977.00s -> 8982.60s]  embarrassed by like something weird showing up. I'm embarrassed by the volume of eating videos
[8982.60s -> 8988.58s]  that are going to be there. And I, that's kind of, I don't, I don't know if I like that. The volume
[8988.58s -> 8994.71s]  of like people eating or like drinking liquids really fast. It's going to be, it's going to be
[8994.71s -> 9011.77s]  predominantly there. I'm done. I'm done. Thanks for participating. We're going to move on.
[9011.77s -> 9016.41s]  We won't judge you. Oh, please. That's, you guys are in the game. You guys are in the business
[9016.41s -> 9022.10s]  of judging me. You guys, that's what you are here for. That's, you are in the business of judging me,
[9022.10s -> 9031.82s]  especially with things like this. Maybe I'll do it. I'll go look and see if it's like weird.
[9031.82s -> 9039.83s]  Not today though. Maybe like on Friday. Nah, give me a new door because I have to get my
[9039.83s -> 9045.83s]  iPads like not fucking, no, my iPads are not even charged. It's no, not going to happen. You'll see
[9045.83s -> 9062.30s]  maybe on Friday. If I, you know, decided to do that. Nothing to hide, nothing to fear. We'll see
[9062.30s -> 9093.62s]  on Friday. We'll, we'll see if I do it. I'm watching this on my iPad. No, you're just going
[9093.62s -> 9100.42s]  to watch normal videos on Thursday. You will know if it's full of shit, if it's regular ass videos.
[9100.42s -> 9108.04s]  Okay. I just told you the, all the fucking stuff that I watch. And if on Friday I'm like, hey,
[9108.04s -> 9112.92s]  take a look at my YouTube recommended. Yeah, it's normal. See, it's like, oh, how to build a
[9112.92s -> 9119.88s]  birdhouse and, oh, top 10 Marvel characters who you could be like, you're going to be like full of
[9119.88s -> 9128.63s]  shit. You guys know what I was looking at. So I can't hide that. Yeah. If my recommended is like,
[9130.33s -> 9135.13s]  but I don't know why you'd even want this. Oh, the end of far from home explained.
[9136.50s -> 9154.15s]  You would know that I, I'm full of shit. There's going to be a lot of infomercials. Do liked videos.
[9154.15s -> 9162.39s]  I don't, I don't do that. I just let the automatic recommend to just throw up into my face. I don't
[9162.39s -> 9168.17s]  do, I don't like videos. I don't save them. I don't bookmark them. I just watch. I just pick
[9168.17s -> 9174.90s]  a random one and just go and just go for like four hours. I've never liked a video. I don't think
[9174.90s -> 9178.90s]  since like, maybe like, I don't know. God damn fucking decade ago. I have no idea. I don't think
[9178.90s -> 9188.52s]  I even did. He hates videos. I don't, I just don't. Okay. Please, we need to get a door in here.
[9188.52s -> 9198.52s]  You're fucking with me. It's going to be like Kathy Mitchell, Express 101, Kathy Mitchell,
[9198.52s -> 9206.22s]  the turbo cooker, Kathy Mitchell, the snack master, Kathy Mitchell, infomercial,
[9206.22s -> 9218.30s]  Kathy Murch Mitchell, infomercial, long version. I swear Kathy Mitchell, DVD turbo cooker,
[9218.30s -> 9223.42s]  because it was like three hours and it's her just doing recipes for the turbo cooker.
[9223.42s -> 9233.16s]  It's not the infomercial. They go, I just read you the last, I read you the last six. I'm never
[9233.16s -> 9239.37s]  going to get this house done. Thanks a lot. All right. These, these doors were too weird.
[9239.37s -> 9252.86s]  So give me a normal one. Just a regular interior door. Just a regular ass door. Just a regular
[9252.86s -> 9287.64s]  interior. There's a ton of stuff in mod chat right now. Oh God. I'm never going to finish
[9287.64s -> 9302.09s]  this house. I don't know. Why am I, what is this from? What the fuck is this? When did I do this?
[9302.09s -> 9315.43s]  Huh? Why am I naked? When did I do that? What the fuck is this? What is this from? Why am I nude?
[9315.43s -> 9349.61s]  Why would I be watching this? I don't know. Somebody said, why are your nipples so high?
[9349.61s -> 9359.80s]  I need to investigate. Hold on. I need to investigate this. I need this to be investigated.
[9359.80s -> 9375.74s]  This is so confusing. Yeah. What the fuck? Like up here. That doesn't look right. That doesn't look
[9375.74s -> 9400.68s]  right. Where's your mic? Dude, I, uh, look at how, oh my God. Why would I be watching this?
[9400.68s -> 9409.32s]  There's so many of these. I will never be able to get through them. No. All right. You, you know,
[9409.32s -> 9421.66s]  go to the, the, the sub stream is doing a whole lot of shit. Go check it out. It's funny. There's
[9421.66s -> 9426.62s]  going to be watching baby sensory videos. Me watching what I am that. I'm assuming it's like
[9426.70s -> 9437.98s]  porn or something. There's me watching this stream. Top 10 son. No, I don't, I don't know.
[9437.98s -> 9448.14s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's go. Let's go. I'm out.
[9448.14s -> 9466.15s]  That was a lot of fun. Thanks for participating. I don't care. It doesn't matter what this door is.
[9466.15s -> 9471.75s]  I don't care. Let me just finish the fucking house already. I knocked down five walls. Stop
[9471.75s -> 9476.73s]  you. Bring me back to my Minecraft days. It's been three hours. I'll fix it later. I need to
[9476.73s -> 9498.10s]  put animals in here. This is a mouth like you want. This is the one everyone's talking about.
[9498.10s -> 9525.51s]  I don't why would I be fucking watching this? You don't have to show it. Oh God. No. All right.
[9525.51s -> 9530.97s]  I'm knocking this wall down right now and nothing's going to stop me. Nothing's going to stop me.
[9530.97s -> 9537.96s]  I'm knocking this wall down. Nothing is going to stop me. I'm a 36 year old man. Let's relax.
[9537.96s -> 9552.76s]  I'm a 36 year old man. It's time for you to start acting like one. That was so loud. Why is it? Why
[9552.76s -> 9566.02s]  did this get louder? How did this get even louder? I don't know how that got so loud. Okay. So let's
[9566.02s -> 9579.26s]  continue. This is going to be the bathroom very quickly, very quickly. Let's get it done. Let's
[9579.26s -> 9596.57s]  get it done. Bathroom right here. It's fine. It doesn't need to be big. I just need it to exist.
[9596.57s -> 9622.47s]  I don't care. I'm not going to watch the video right now. Give it a rest. Okay. This goes to the
[9622.47s -> 9635.50s]  bedroom. This is going to go to the bathroom right here. There it is. Excellent. Looking good. It's
[9635.50s -> 9641.24s]  a small bathroom, but it doesn't need to be large. This needs to be small enough, big enough to
[9642.12s -> 9645.56s]  go in there and do whatever you need to do. And then here we go. This is where the iguana
[9645.56s -> 9657.00s]  is going to live. The doors can be replaced later. I don't care if they're ugly. They just have to
[9657.00s -> 9667.61s]  exist. I don't care. Oh, my eyes are so irritated. Why are my eyes so irritated? There's just a lot
[9667.61s -> 9677.59s]  of irritation right now. It's good. Yeah, it looks fine. All right. Speaking of in the bathroom,
[9677.59s -> 9690.44s]  my eyes are so itchy. All right. I need floors. We'll do the walls first. Well, it's a nice
[9690.44s -> 9696.52s]  bathroom one. How about, I don't know, green? Let's go. Let's get wild with it. Let's get wild
[9696.52s -> 9733.93s]  with it, right? Why not? Should we get wild with it? Green? Let's get wild with it. All right. This
[9733.93s -> 9750.54s]  is some Wizard of Oz munchkin land shit. Should I leave it? Oh, Emerald City. That's what I was
[9750.54s -> 9756.12s]  thinking of. Well, wasn't it munchkin land as well? It was all that green, wasn't it? Emerald City,
[9756.12s -> 9769.96s]  not munchkin land. It's a Yoda bathroom. I think it should be. If I put this, whatever,
[9769.96s -> 9789.82s]  I'm sticking with it. I second guess too much. Okay. We need some, you know what I'm saying?
[9789.82s -> 9801.98s]  We need, we need floors. Floor and ceiling tiles. How about this one? I've got to brighten it up a
[9801.98s -> 9814.78s]  little. Okay. Let's make this a little nicer looking. The ceiling should be, let's just make
[9814.78s -> 9843.69s]  it white. Put some nice lights in here too. Okay. Get rid of that. We need some nice bathroom
[9843.69s -> 9852.87s]  lights. It's a green screen room. Lights. Something nice. Something really nice. Really brighten it
[9852.87s -> 9865.58s]  up too. I need something to brighten it up. I actually, these would be all right. These are
[9865.58s -> 9901.16s]  nice and clean. Yeah. These are clean. Yeah. These are clean. Those are clean. There are no fire
[9901.16s -> 9917.59s]  escapes. Just wait. Why? What do you mean fire escape? Oh dude, our jacuzzi is definitely going
[9917.59s -> 9925.40s]  back there somewhere. I don't know. No windows in the bathroom. No. I don't want that. Zero. No
[9925.40s -> 9930.28s]  windows in my fucking bathroom. I don't want a window in the bathroom. What? So the window
[9930.28s -> 9935.96s]  in the curtains can be closed permanently and never ever opened ever for any reason ever.
[9936.52s -> 9942.04s]  Never opened. Why would I want a bathroom window? What are you talking about? Ever. You want me to
[9942.04s -> 9951.29s]  put a window here for it to permanently be closed and never have the curtains opened ever. I don't
[9951.29s -> 9960.39s]  like that. I don't like that. Maybe you'd get a frosted window. They have them. They don't have
[9960.39s -> 9986.41s]  frosted windows. Yeah. No. Fuck that. Fuck this. Yeah. Fuck this. Why would you want a window here?
[9986.41s -> 10017.18s]  I don't want a window in my bathroom. Loud. Careful. Yeah. I don't like that. I don't like
[10017.18s -> 10027.26s]  this shit, but whatever. Get some air in here. Why is my eye so itchy? It's fucking making me
[10027.26s -> 10041.43s]  mad. Am I like, I have allergies or something? What's going on here? This feels like a room on
[10041.43s -> 10045.53s]  a spaceship or something, but whatever. It's like an escape pod. All right. I got my window. I need
[10045.53s -> 10063.30s]  my installations for the bathroom. Okay. Bathroom. I want toilet plumbing system. Toilet is going to
[10063.30s -> 10090.42s]  go right. Okay. I also want a shower. Yeah. No bathtub. Shower plumbing system. Shower can be
[10090.42s -> 10104.02s]  in the corner over here. Can I not move it up? There we go. All right. That's fine. Let's go.
[10104.02s -> 10115.14s]  No bathtub. I don't need a bathtub. Did you actually put lemon juice in your eye?
[10115.14s -> 10133.80s]  Where'd I get the lemon juice from? This is kind of lemony. It's kind of lemony. Okay. Shower.
[10133.80s -> 10169.56s]  Say it with me now. Oh, none of you are fucking going to do it. That's surprising. Okay. There's
[10169.56s -> 10176.28s]  the shower. That looks fine. Let's watch out for the door. What is this? Oh, a toilet needs to go
[10176.28s -> 10196.30s]  here. Toilet. Okay. Suspended toilet. I was like, what? I was like, is this a toilet? Standing toilet
[10196.30s -> 10224.30s]  paper. All right. How about this one? Now I just need a sink. I need some toilet paper there. See?
[10224.30s -> 10232.68s]  Okay. Now I need to sink and a mirror and a painting. I need a weight. I need a mountable
[10232.68s -> 10259.64s]  sink. Right there. Why am I so itchy? Rotate the shower. You can do that in your game. All right.
[10259.64s -> 10278.74s]  I need a mountable sink. Oh, I like that. I like this one. I like that kind of basin style. The
[10278.74s -> 10283.58s]  water always comes out of these really cool. Let me see if I can describe. You know what I mean?
[10283.58s -> 10292.47s]  When it's like, it's this weird, there's no bubbles in the water. It's just this really see-through
[10293.27s -> 10297.45s]  stream. Do you know what I'm talking about? When you turn on a faucet and it goes,
[10298.17s -> 10310.50s]  it's called laminar flow. Yeah. What is that called? Cause I want it. Laminar flow. Okay.
[10310.50s -> 10322.63s]  I want that. I love that so much. It's like my favorite thing in the world.
[10322.63s -> 10342.06s]  There are microplastics in it. I don't have one. There are microplastics all over your body right
[10342.06s -> 10353.72s]  now. We'll get them off. I don't want them on me. Put a trash can in here. Yep. This looks fine.
[10353.72s -> 10377.66s]  There. Now I just need a painting. I need a bathroom painting. Like a lemon. I just need a lemon.
[10377.66s -> 10397.03s]  Something lemony. Something lemony. That's kind of lemony. That one was the most lemony, I think.
[10397.03s -> 10416.12s]  This one looks pretty lemony, I think. This one is way too fucking big. Why are these so huge?
[10416.12s -> 10431.93s]  Okay. Now I need a mirror. Just a basic one. Oh, all right. I like that. Bigger than that,
[10431.93s -> 10448.98s]  though. Is that too high? Is that too low? Okay. That's fine. Look at that. The bathroom is done
[10448.98s -> 10461.98s]  and it's a beautiful one. I need a little rug. This one's a lemony. Oh, and I don't know anything
[10461.98s -> 10470.60s]  about design. I don't know anything about how the world works. Look at that. Take a look. That's a
[10470.60s -> 10475.24s]  nice bathroom. It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it. Oh, but you need to rotate the shower
[10475.24s -> 10484.84s]  and start banning them. Okay. So that's cool. Now we can start to think about where I want
[10484.84s -> 10494.73s]  the animals to be. Here's the front door. Okay. Front door. Coming in here. What do I want the
[10494.73s -> 10500.02s]  painting on the walls to be? And is there going to be another room? I think so. All right. Yeah.
[10501.22s -> 10519.35s]  Watch. Let's get rid of this. That's the bathroom. This is the bedroom. And then I need, this will
[10519.35s -> 10528.38s]  be a nice enclosure here. Right here. I can maybe do some fish tanks and shit. I am so ready. This
[10528.38s -> 10531.90s]  is going to be so fun. Are you guys ready? It's going to be so fun. It's going to be so cool.
[10531.90s -> 10557.58s]  Okay. So the wall should be there. Just we'll go straight across from here to there. What's wrong?
[10557.58s -> 10566.10s]  And my axe and my bow. And my axe and my bow. Activate sleeper agent. Code onion ring.
[10570.54s -> 10591.19s]  Whatever. Okay. I need the walls again. Onion ring. It's actually kind of fun and funny that
[10591.19s -> 10601.86s]  I will, I will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on shows. And the biggest memes that come
[10601.86s -> 10608.41s]  out of these, this channel is like, I found an onion ring in my French fries. And I'm the guy
[10608.41s -> 10631.54s]  from the Among Us guy. I'm the serial killer AI guy. That's so funny. They're uneven. What do you,
[10631.54s -> 10637.30s]  I'm fixing it right now, but they have to be uneven because I want it to be flush to the door
[10637.30s -> 10644.22s]  here. It doesn't have to be flush to the door. Okay. That's actually annoying. It can be flush
[10644.22s -> 10667.93s]  with this. So whatever. So this now can go here because I want this to be the wall. This is going
[10667.93s -> 10678.89s]  to be our first enclosure. Here we go. Let's go. Here we go. Let's do it. All right. So what should
[10678.89s -> 10698.36s]  I put in here? I'm wondering, what do you guys think? I need lights. First of all, chickens.
[10699.99s -> 10715.83s]  What can you actually put in here? I just want a lamp. There's a cat treadmill. I just want lights,
[10715.83s -> 10721.74s]  ceiling lamps, just something basic for now. I can play with it later. Just basic, basic,
[10721.74s -> 10725.45s]  just to get light in here. It doesn't have to be exact. Everyone's going to be pissed that they're
[10725.45s -> 10738.73s]  not lined up correctly. It's just to get light in here. Okay. So this is animal room one. Let's
[10738.73s -> 10745.74s]  see what I want to do here. Pets. Wellen freshwater aquarium. Snake terrarium. Should
[10745.74s -> 10760.79s]  I do some snakes? What should be up here? Birds? Hamsters? Just do a bunch of reptiles. Spider
[10760.79s -> 10769.75s]  terrarium. Spiders will go downstairs. Okay. Let's do a bunch of iguanas and lizards. All right. Let's
[10769.75s -> 10784.10s]  do lizards. This thing is huge. This thing is actually too big. No, it's not. All right. Here's
[10784.10s -> 10798.82s]  our iguana terrarium. It fits perfectly in this spot. I can put some little decorations around it.
[10798.82s -> 10807.74s]  Nice. Okay. Buy two to fill the wall. I don't think two will fit. All right. Now we can do
[10807.74s -> 10815.88s]  like a snake and a snake. What are the small reptiles going to do? Do aquarium. What about,
[10815.88s -> 10827.75s]  yeah, snakes maybe. Oh yeah. We can do four. All right. Let me put this on a counter. Is it like
[10827.75s -> 10840.82s]  a table or a counter or something that I can build it on top of? Do a turtle. Well, let's do snakes
[10840.82s -> 10849.19s]  over here and then turtles over there. I don't even do I have access to a snake? Or am I access
[10849.19s -> 10861.46s]  to a turtle? Hamster? Where's turtle? Turtle's not here. Oh, there we go. Okay. How big is this?
[10861.46s -> 10868.55s]  All right. This is huge. It can just, I think, can it just sit on the ground, right? It can just
[10868.55s -> 10875.64s]  sit there, right? That's fine. Should I just do two turtles or should I do two snakes over here?
[10875.64s -> 10889.64s]  Turtle, iguana, and two snakes. You look like a fish. Yeah, whatever. I'll do two snakes,
[10889.64s -> 10897.16s]  but I need to be up off the ground. What is it? Because my mouth goes like this? Because my mouth
[10897.16s -> 10902.98s]  goes like that. My lips. I have like these, I have like a fish mouth. Yeah. You don't think I know
[10902.98s -> 10909.56s]  that? You don't think I know I have like a mouth that like goes like too far this way? You don't
[10909.64s -> 10915.46s]  think I've ever seen that before? You don't think I've never looked at that before? I can breathe
[10915.46s -> 10925.30s]  underwater. You can't. What if I just lifted up my like neck over here and it was just gills? Just
[10925.30s -> 10942.02s]  like bing bing bing bing bing. Okay, Jim Carrey, settle down. Okay, I need a counter. This is
[10942.02s -> 10959.80s]  probably big enough, right? I don't want it to be like that though. Here we go. I think that's fine.
[10959.80s -> 10979.66s]  Yeah, that's like kind of snake themed, isn't it? I need a longer than that. There's a shorter one,
[10979.66s -> 11009.91s]  right? Look at that. Perfect. Can I fit two? I can. No, I can't. Yes, I can. There we go.
[11009.99s -> 11021.14s]  Okay, we got two snakes. I got a turtle and an iguana. Pretty cool. All right. Now what?
[11021.14s -> 11028.23s]  Let's do this while I'm here. This room needs to be a little bit more inviting too. What should be
[11028.23s -> 11042.79s]  what should go on the ground? I don't know what to put on the ground. Put a snake skin rug on the
[11042.79s -> 11061.18s]  ground. Excuse me? All right, I need to do um the walls are just so awful looking. Oh, let's go back
[11061.18s -> 11091.86s]  to pets. What else is here? There's no bunnies in here. Don't do that. What is this? Holy shit.
[11091.86s -> 11125.64s]  How do I get out of here? I'm stuck here. That's going right here. Oh my god. That's so annoyingly
[11125.64s -> 11132.62s]  large. Where? How? What are you supposed to do with this? What are you actually supposed to do
[11132.62s -> 11152.41s]  with this? Why is this floating? Oh, it goes against the corner. Okay, what's what does this
[11152.41s -> 11161.21s]  go to? Oh, fuck it. Whatever. I don't care. What does this go to? It's the bathroom shit. Um,
[11161.21s -> 11190.42s]  we can go over here. That works. What is that? It is a cat aggro crag. It's the bedroom. I'll do
[11190.42s -> 11199.99s]  that later. Bathroom is fine. All right, here's the let's go back in here. Take care of this.
[11199.99s -> 11215.91s]  I need to do this. Where do you eat? I'll make a little kitchenette over here. Kitchenette can
[11215.91s -> 11248.76s]  exist over there. I think it should be fine. I got three hundred thirteen thousand bucks. I'm fine.
[11248.76s -> 11265.94s]  Get rid of this too. I don't want this. Here's the back entrance. We're going to do a little
[11265.94s -> 11270.42s]  we're going to do a huge patio here and there's going to be a ton of play areas for the dogs,
[11270.42s -> 11276.65s]  the cats. Just let me how much does it cost to buy like 40 animals? Is it more than three hundred
[11276.65s -> 11286.86s]  thousand dollars? It's probably a lot. Yeah, it's probably a lot. We're going to find out
[11286.86s -> 11297.85s]  if I need to go sell the other house. I will. Okay, back to this room is the reptile den.
[11297.85s -> 11303.88s]  I'm going to think of the night if the reptile den is going to be green. It's going to be green,
[11304.52s -> 11316.86s]  light green, dark green on the floor. Yeah. Oh, that's kind of cool. It could be green,
[11316.86s -> 11331.43s]  green and brown. Let's just do some paint. Yeah, something like this. Strong green maybe for the
[11331.43s -> 11339.58s]  see for the walls. Now that's too dark. Here we go. How about like spring grass or ripe hair?
[11339.58s -> 11345.42s]  We'll try spring grass. I feel like this is going to be it. My god, my eyeball is going to fall out
[11345.42s -> 11367.13s]  of my head. Let's do a sample. I mean, it's the reptile room. That's what's happening. This is
[11367.13s -> 11387.99s]  the reptile room. You spoke too much. No, I did not. I like that. That's cute. I can put some
[11387.99s -> 11392.79s]  paintings up. We will dress it up a little bit so it doesn't look so plain. It's too light. We'll
[11392.79s -> 11422.33s]  dress it up. Don't worry. No one's going to see this wall, so who cares? It's good. Paint it.
[11422.33s -> 11446.76s]  Landlord special. Don't paint behind the furniture. I don't know. I feel like if I was a landlord,
[11446.76s -> 11454.52s]  I feel like I would be constantly just, is everything okay over there? Things going good?
[11454.52s -> 11461.86s]  Something break? Does something need fixing? I would want it to be like really good over there.
[11461.86s -> 11479.54s]  I don't understand that concept. I would be so concerned that you can't tell if this doesn't
[11479.54s -> 11497.83s]  look good. If I was like, hey, my sink is broken and I need someone to come fix it. I'd be like,
[11497.83s -> 11503.45s]  you stay right there. I'll be over in five minutes and I get out of my pajamas and go over.
[11503.45s -> 11511.66s]  I don't know. That's because I want to make sure this shit's fucking taken care of. I own this
[11511.66s -> 11521.59s]  property. If I own this fucking place, what am I just going to hang up? Yeah, I don't care.
[11521.59s -> 11531.11s]  What the fuck are you talking about? I'll be over there in five minutes. Okay, so that's the green.
[11531.11s -> 11545.75s]  This is a nice green reptile room. They do do that. Could you fix it? I would get the appropriate
[11545.75s -> 11559.51s]  person that could or try. You need to be there. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I kind of like this
[11559.51s -> 11566.52s]  wood for the reptile room, don't you? I think it's kind of like the Jurassic Park kind of.
[11566.52s -> 11579.48s]  I kind of like it. I don't mind this. Okay, we're going to leave that for now. I'll come back to
[11579.48s -> 11587.54s]  this. Okay, so now I need to figure out where I'm going to have my leisure time. And I think
[11587.54s -> 11595.54s]  this is going to be an aquarium in here, by the way. That's going to be the aquarium room.
[11595.54s -> 11622.01s]  In fact, let's get this started right now. Okay, I need counters. Counter. Okay.
[11629.02s -> 11645.22s]  My fucking eye, it's fucked up. All right, I need this. I need a long counter. Are you allergic
[11645.22s -> 11654.73s]  to reptiles? No, I'm fine. This is way too short, like a shoe rack. Dude, you blink like a reptile.
[11654.73s -> 11668.12s]  I also go like this every 15 seconds. I probably am a reptile. That has to be a little bit higher.
[11668.12s -> 11700.49s]  I blink a lot. I go, I look my lips all the time. I don't know. This is going to be so sick coming
[11700.49s -> 11708.07s]  in. Oh, this is basic. This has been facing the wrong way the whole time, hasn't it? Has it? It
[11708.07s -> 11716.47s]  has been. Oops. I got to go. Shit. I got to fix that. The other ones in there are backwards.
[11716.47s -> 11734.58s]  It's okay. Light. They all have lights. Well, that's cool. Okay. Well, these have to flip.
[11734.58s -> 11758.76s]  Just leave them. At this point, I really don't care. Those are not flush fish tanks. Okay.
[11758.76s -> 11771.99s]  Fresh water. We'll do fresh water over here. Whoa, that's a lot. This is huge. I can't. All right.
[11771.99s -> 11794.70s]  I got to rethink this. Oh my god. This is too big. This is way too fucking big. Maybe not. It's not
[11794.70s -> 11836.68s]  going to be big if I have a smaller door. Nice. Is this facing the wrong way? I can't really tell.
[11836.68s -> 11852.41s]  Oh, this looks like a PetSmart. It kind of does. It does look like a PetSmart. Stack them. Can I do
[11852.41s -> 11862.68s]  that? I can't stack them. That's fine. I don't need more than that. That's a nice entryway.
[11862.68s -> 11880.68s]  It's the Rainforest Cafe. Where's the iguana? Oh, I didn't finish that. Something reptilian.
[11880.68s -> 11905.93s]  This is kind of reptilian. Oh, some of these are pretty reptilian. This feels like a really big
[11905.93s -> 11930.66s]  afterthought. This is fine. I like the kind of, yeah, these are like kind of leaves and shit.
[11930.66s -> 11943.59s]  I don't know. People do weird shit like that with paintings, don't they? All right, that's fine. I
[11943.59s -> 11971.14s]  don't put a little table here. Cat aviary? What's a cat aviary? Where's the dog? I haven't gotten
[11971.14s -> 11979.75s]  there yet. I just need like a, yeah, like one of these is fine. No, that's in the way. I don't care.
[11980.47s -> 11983.27s]  That's fine. This is as good as it's going to get because I need to get the animals in here.
[11983.99s -> 11995.53s]  All right. This is the front door. You got your cat tree thing here that can stay open. I need a
[11995.53s -> 12004.60s]  little kitchen. Kitchen's going to have to be right here. Just a little kitchenette because this goes
[12004.60s -> 12015.98s]  into the bathroom. This is the bedroom. We're going to move this to here because I need this
[12015.98s -> 12024.97s]  to be a kitchen. So that's what's going to happen. I need this to be, this has to be a little kitchen
[12024.97s -> 12046.09s]  area. Otherwise, how am I going to cook? That's better. Okay, so now this can be a little kitchen
[12046.09s -> 12078.31s]  corner. I'm thinking, I want tile. See how this looks. No passion. That looks stupid. If this was
[12078.31s -> 12104.42s]  a kitchen area, I didn't see the whole thing. It looks like a pizza parlor. Why do I know what
[12104.42s -> 12113.96s]  you mean? But it's, I don't secret room, secret room. Why do you keep saying secret room? What
[12113.96s -> 12156.44s]  do you mean secret room? There's a room on your map. Huh? What is this? What the fuck is this?
[12156.44s -> 12174.14s]  What is this? Um, oh, well, okay, I can take this down. So now this can be the little kitchenette
[12174.14s -> 12185.80s]  in here. That's okay. That's much better because then I can do a little kitchen in here.
[12185.80s -> 12195.34s]  Okay, I get it. Nice. That makes sense. Okay, so now let's do, uh, what do I, I don't like the way
[12195.34s -> 12210.57s]  that looked. Something nice and kitchen-y. This is kind of kitchen-y. That's kind of kitchen-y,
[12210.57s -> 12233.26s]  isn't it? It looks like a chocolate bar. It just looks like a new Hershey's chocolate s'more thing.
[12234.36s -> 12252.25s]  Maybe it works. I need to see the whole thing. Nah, I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like
[12252.25s -> 12274.71s]  it. I'm not a huge fan, so I'm taking it down. What about this one? It's grandma wallpaper. Let's
[12274.71s -> 12282.46s]  try this one. A little bit lighter though. Yeah, like a light biscuit. Let's try that. Light biscuits
[12282.46s -> 12311.00s]  should be good. That's better. That's fine. Yeah, that's, that looks cute. What's wrong with that?
[12311.00s -> 12327.91s]  This should, I have it go all the way out though. Yeah, probably like that. I'll change this. Okay,
[12327.91s -> 12344.14s]  that floor has got to go. Please add trim. I just want to get rid of these. So, I need a better
[12344.14s -> 12360.28s]  floor for here. What should I put in here? Tile? A nicer tile. A nice tile. I like tile. What's
[12360.28s -> 12386.65s]  wrong with tile? One of these looks good. I like that. Let's try this. What's wrong with that? I
[12386.65s -> 12399.74s]  need a stopping point for this though, and I don't like it being here. Oh, it's the same thing that's
[12399.74s -> 12413.85s]  in the bathroom. Is that fine? I think that's okay. Isn't this, I think that's fine. It's a
[12413.85s -> 12422.89s]  fucking ballroom. It's going too far into the living room. Well, I got to figure out what I want
[12422.89s -> 12442.17s]  in the living room. What the fuck happened? Why did this fall? Why did that fall? I was worried.
[12442.17s -> 12451.29s]  Okay, so I know the kitchen is going to be here, so we're going to do kitchen stuff. I need a fridge.
[12451.29s -> 12479.16s]  Uh, I like this. Fridge, and then a counter, an oven. Okay, let's do a fucking double oven.
[12479.16s -> 12498.01s]  Triple oven. Okay, triple oven. And then I'll do some cabinets with a washing machine. Dishwasher.
[12498.01s -> 12519.46s]  Just good old stainless, stainless steel. That right here. Part of that. We'll get some cabinets
[12519.46s -> 12550.26s]  here too. I need a sink. Why, I don't know, why are they so small? That's weird. Fucking horrible.
[12550.26s -> 12561.10s]  What kind of, I want just a kitchen sink. I just want a kitchen sink. Okay, here we go. Thank you.
[12561.10s -> 12575.16s]  Give me this one. Does this even match? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, we'll do a counter this way.
[12575.16s -> 12627.43s]  One counter, one counter. Whoa! Give me this thing. Oh my god, it's already done. I don't have to do
[12627.43s -> 12661.05s]  anything. It's already ready. That's so much better. Okay, cool. That sink is trash. It's fine. Okay,
[12661.05s -> 12687.66s]  looks fine. Let's make one of these over on the other side. I'll be honest, I don't care. I don't
[12687.66s -> 12707.90s]  give a shit. I tell you, I don't care. Zero passion. I'm passionate about the animals, not about what
[12707.90s -> 12716.82s]  the kitchen looks like. That doesn't even look that bad. All right, so now I can, let's clean this up.
[12716.82s -> 12725.38s]  Cat, tower, aquarium, and then the bugs and the bugs will be down here. Okay, cool. Let's get that
[12725.38s -> 12739.70s]  started. All right, I need some dog stuff and cat stuff. Here's the little kitchen, living room.
[12739.70s -> 12756.39s]  Oops. I'll put stairs somewhere else. Stairs will be, where the hell the stairs gonna go?
[12756.39s -> 12762.20s]  I think they need to be down like over here. Over here in this corner? Where am I gonna put the
[12762.20s -> 12780.17s]  stairs? Maybe they can, I thought maybe they can only be in that spot. This works. This actually
[12780.17s -> 12839.46s]  kind of works. Come on, really? Give me a break. Okay, this is scary. I need it there temporarily.
[12839.46s -> 12852.01s]  I can't even go down this. There's so many more. Okay, but it takes up so much less space.
[12852.01s -> 12868.52s]  This takes up so much less room. The other one is this big. It's so massive. Evil cellar. Not,
[12868.60s -> 12881.62s]  just wait. It's less cute. What do the other stairs look like? Garden stairs. Okay, wait,
[12881.62s -> 12895.10s]  stairs. All right, this is way better. Yeah, yep, yep, yep. We'll make it a little darker.
[12895.10s -> 12901.91s]  Okay, that's better. Oh my god, it's so, it's too huge. Look at how huge this fucking thing is.
[12901.91s -> 12909.96s]  It's the whole house. I'm keeping the attic stairs. Look at this. This is not gonna work.
[12909.96s -> 12947.02s]  Put it on the side. It's too big. The spiral takes up less space. I want a little one. Yeah,
[12947.02s -> 12977.90s]  less space. Really? This is the whole house. This is the entire house. All right, this is kind of
[12977.90s -> 12982.63s]  stupid, but whatever. Do I really need the cat thing? Are you trying to tell me to get rid of
[12982.63s -> 12990.20s]  the cat thing? I can't put it anywhere else. Maybe over here? There's no other corner where this can
[12990.20s -> 13000.79s]  go. No, this has to stay. I can't move that. I think that's fine, although the color is awful.
[13000.79s -> 13013.96s]  This just needs to be a little more unassuming. Okay, that's a little better. I think that's fine.
[13013.96s -> 13021.77s]  It doesn't matter. Look, it's not gonna be a TV. I'm putting the couch right here to watch the cats.
[13021.77s -> 13036.50s]  That's more interesting than television anyways. It looks like shit, but there's no other place I
[13036.50s -> 13048.74s]  can put this unless I get rid of this corner, but then I'd have to make the bathroom entrance here.
[13048.74s -> 13067.32s]  Let's try it. Bathroom right in front of the fridge. This shit is way too fucking big.
[13067.32s -> 13079.10s]  It's so enormous. It can't go anywhere. Build another room. I can't. You cannot build out.
[13079.10s -> 13084.84s]  You cannot build out. You can only build in. I can't build. Where am I supposed to put it?
[13084.84s -> 13094.17s]  The only thing I can think of is... Let's see if this does it. Ready? Let's try this. I have an idea.
[13094.17s -> 13151.05s]  I have an idea. Let's see if it works. This would be fine. Not big enough. I could do one here,
[13151.05s -> 13159.75s]  which that's fine. That's fine. That's okay. We don't need two snakes. I'll find a place for it,
[13159.75s -> 13166.07s]  but let me see if I can put the staircase here. Give me a small staircase. Is there a small one
[13166.07s -> 13172.23s]  I can put right here? Right there. Come on. Really? There's no place to go down the stairs?
[13172.23s -> 13198.63s]  I gotta go down there and I gotta break a bunch of shit. Hold on. Fucking dump down here. Yeah,
[13198.63s -> 13230.54s]  I want this here. Okay. I think that should do it. There's just stuff in the way. Is it construction
[13230.54s -> 13250.38s]  lights or something I can put down here? There's a bright ass construction light. I just want to
[13250.38s -> 13284.81s]  be able to see. Okay. Now I should theoretically be able to move this into this corner. At least
[13284.81s -> 13304.41s]  I hope so. Let's find out. Why is there a handprint down here? I don't know. I just bought this place.
[13304.41s -> 13314.66s]  Okay. Now can I move? Hopefully the lights aren't going to be in the way they might though.
[13314.66s -> 13332.30s]  Okay. It looks good. Can I move those over here? Here. Even if it has to be the attic, I don't care.
[13332.30s -> 13360.33s]  It just needs to fit there. I just need a way to get down the stairs. And really? Is this, is it a
[13360.33s -> 13367.02s]  wall there or something? I don't get it. It's a wall here. It's a wall, wall, wall, wall, wall.
[13367.02s -> 13379.93s]  Where's that fucking wall? Where? Oh, bullshit. Why is the house wider? That should be able to
[13379.93s -> 13411.00s]  go right there. Turn it around. I don't think that's going to work. I'll try it. No, no. Switch sides.
[13411.00s -> 13431.38s]  Oh shit. Is it going to fit? Yes. Okay. Can the regular staircase fit here though? No, not really.
[13433.50s -> 13492.78s]  Kind of. No, but it's messing up my view. I guess I could do this with something else over here
[13492.78s -> 13524.04s]  because now I can move this down. I'll do this wall. Will that fit over here? All the snakes can fit
[13524.04s -> 13537.59s]  now. Nice. Okay. Yes. All right. We're good. I want to be a little bit more unassuming though. I don't
[13537.59s -> 13555.64s]  like the light. That looks good. That's fine. Okay. The light switches above the stairs. I'll fix it
[13555.64s -> 13564.89s]  later. Okay. So now that does that. Reptile room is still fine. I can fix the green paint. I can
[13564.89s -> 13569.72s]  weigh down. Where does this end up? Actually, perfect. I'm actually really happy with that.
[13569.72s -> 13579.86s]  We're gonna keep it. Okay. Let's get some animals in here. Where do I get animals? Where do I get
[13579.86s -> 13598.28s]  animals? Where's my dog? Oh, I have to go to the menu. Okay. Okay. Let's get... Where's my dog?
[13598.28s -> 13619.08s]  Where's my dog? Come here. All right. There's dog. So now let's get some reptiles. Iguana. Whoa.
[13619.08s -> 13640.23s]  Turtle. We need a turtle. Okay. We need it. One turtle. Name. Crunch. Oh, there you are. Okay.
[13640.23s -> 13674.01s]  Where's crunch? There's crunch. Okay. Crunch looks good. You're gonna go eat? Very cool. All
[13674.01s -> 13687.83s]  right. I'm happy. Now I need... Here. How's the treat? Delicious. Okay. Now I need an iguana. How
[13687.83s -> 13712.46s]  many iguanas can I put in here? Just one, right? Iguana's name. I want... How many iguanas should I
[13712.46s -> 13738.79s]  get? Oh, it needs its own enclosure. Let's go look at Fred. Whoa. Hey, Fred. What do you eat?
[13738.79s -> 13762.52s]  Deviled eggs and lettuce? Okay. Very cool. Fred doesn't come out. What a dinosaur. I don't think
[13762.52s -> 13783.32s]  they come out. That's so cool. Okay. Well, have fun in there, Fred. What are you up to? Let's leave
[13783.32s -> 13790.22s]  it open. I'm not gonna leave the enclosure open. You guys want all the... You know, I'm sorry. No,
[13790.22s -> 13797.88s]  that's not happening. All right. Now we need some cats. Back to the laptop. I need like bunnies and
[13797.88s -> 13808.95s]  cats. Spiders. All right. What about rodents? All right. We need some... I need a cat. I think
[13808.95s -> 13837.40s]  the Bengal kitten. Scrumptious. Very scrumptious. How many cats should I get? This is a ragdoll. This
[13837.40s -> 13862.10s]  is chevious or mischievous. Chevious. Okay. This is chevious. Where are you going? Wait, do I need
[13862.10s -> 13869.48s]  to like make sure there's nothing dangerous in here? Don't go out the window, please. Oh my God.
[13869.48s -> 13885.69s]  You're so cute. Okay. Let's go get some more. Now go play. How's everybody doing? All right. Let's
[13885.69s -> 13908.73s]  get some more. This is a sphinx. Perfect. Little perfect. Except I should have spelled it with a
[13908.73s -> 13927.19s]  U. Okay. There's perfect. And then there's... This is a European. European? Okay. Eiffel. For the
[13927.19s -> 13941.56s]  Eiffel Tower. Okay. Okay. There's a lot of cats. I need cat food. I need a cat food thing. Let me
[13941.56s -> 13958.33s]  take care of this right now. I'm working on it. All this stuff is for rabbits. I don't want rabbit
[13958.33s -> 13970.30s]  shit. I want cat food stuff. All right. We need a dog bowl. Okay. Automatic dog food feeder. That
[13970.30s -> 13983.29s]  looks good. Now I need an automatic cat food feeder. Does one not exist? Automatic dog water?
[13983.29s -> 13987.29s]  Okay. I thought that was just cats eating the dog food. Make sure the dog doesn't eat the cat food.
[13987.29s -> 14002.78s]  Okay. Cats. Automatic cat food feeder. We'll put one here. We should probably do two and then we'll
[14002.78s -> 14022.38s]  do a cat water. Sounds good to me. Wait, this is for dogs. All right. How are you guys? How's
[14022.38s -> 14058.87s]  everybody doing? You guys having a good time? Another rag doll. Doll. You need a litter box.

[14101.82s -> 14114.17s]  There's going to be toys and shit everywhere. I need cat beds. Okay. How many cats do I have? Five?
[14114.17s -> 14127.40s]  Ooh. Look at these. These are nice. Yeah. These are perfect. One for everybody. That can be

[14164.54s -> 14173.70s]  over here. Just delete it. I don't want it. Okay. Now we need, I got, there's a couple of beds.

[14216.79s -> 14228.36s]  want to have too many pets. I don't want to have too many pets. I need to make sure that there's
[14228.36s -> 14232.52s]  enough. Okay. We need to go with the downstairs because I need to make sure there's enough room.
[14232.52s -> 14238.86s]  Where is it downstairs? Okay. This is going to be bugs, but okay. This would be the bug room.
[14238.86s -> 14256.06s]  I need more room. This would be the designated insect room. What was that? We need rodents too.
[14256.06s -> 14260.20s]  All right. One step at a time. This would be the rodent room. These would be the bug room. This
[14260.20s -> 14264.68s]  would be the rodent room. This will be more downstairs play area for the cats, dogs and
[14264.68s -> 14280.30s]  wherever. So let me get this. Let me do this first. How much should I feed? The downstairs is for
[14280.30s -> 14290.58s]  gross animals. That's not what I said. Where's the, where, where's, where's the turtle? Are you all
[14290.58s -> 14315.13s]  right? Oh, hello. Hello. Octavius. Oh, a little bit of a rascal. Come here. Come play. Now leave

[14328.33s -> 14336.71s]  out of here. Everybody come out of this room. You're my favorite, but don't tell anybody.
[14336.71s -> 14372.52s]  Okay. There are just birds. Flight. Nevermind. Ooh, look at this one. How about one of these
[14372.52s -> 14389.46s]  bunny houses right here? Bugs. All right. Bugs. You can be over. Where should I put bugs? Over
[14389.46s -> 14400.94s]  here in the corner. This is a fun spot. This is cute. Oh, there you are. What can you do with the
[14400.94s -> 14432.68s]  bunny? Oh, that's so cute. Here. Want a treat? Oh, I need a litter box. Okay. I got to feed the fish,
[14432.68s -> 14444.97s]  don't I? Are there any fish even in here? How do you, I got to feed the fish. Okay. They got a
[14444.97s -> 14454.38s]  little box now. Is it, is it pee on the ground? Oh, there's like a little, yeah, there's poop
[14454.38s -> 14465.56s]  right here. All right. I got, I have a little box now, so I'm fine. I don't have to pick it up.
[14465.56s -> 14482.22s]  Get rid of that. Okay. I need a new floor. The floor is shit colored. The floor. It's, I can't
[14482.22s -> 14495.18s]  tell. Okay. Will they, will they actually use the litter boxes? Do not go outside. No, no, no, no.
[14495.18s -> 14500.15s]  Nobody's going outside. Everyone's staying right here. And how come no one's used the fun cat
[14500.15s -> 14515.45s]  thing? There's a shit in the sink. There is not a shit in the sink. Uh, okay. Wait, maybe I should
[14515.45s -> 14521.61s]  let them go out. Yeah. You need to go out, right? It's a big yard. You guys want to go hang out?
[14521.61s -> 14537.48s]  Look, there's, just be careful. The eagle. Is there a fence? I don't think their programming
[14537.48s -> 14543.14s]  will make them, I don't, this is a invisible wall, I think. Yeah. It's an, it's not an invisible wall.
[14543.14s -> 14558.82s]  I don't think they can even come down here. I really, I really doubt it. This is my cat.
[14558.82s -> 14571.10s]  Oh, come here. Go get the yarn. They're having so much fun. Okay. Everyone's having such a good
[14571.10s -> 14596.95s]  time. Put a fence? I don't, it's a fence even exist? This is for a bunny enclosure. There. Now
[14596.95s -> 14618.07s]  they can't go over here. There. Okay. That's good. This looks like shit. It just needs to be
[14618.07s -> 14622.74s]  practical. It doesn't look all right. Very cool. All right. Uh, this one has, there's a fence around
[14622.74s -> 14634.01s]  here. They're good. I messed it up. Just wait. Look, it's fine. They can't get out this way.
[14634.01s -> 14659.90s]  They can't get out over here. They can get out over here though. Let me fix this. Watch out. Watch
[14660.38s -> 14666.34s]  out. Get over the other way. You're not supposed to be over here. Please go over there. Here. Look
[14666.34s -> 14686.82s]  what I got. The fucking bunny went to go get it and you didn't. I'm here. Get over here. I need to
[14686.82s -> 14701.35s]  pick you up. Stay here. Oh, you got the, nice. You got the ball. Good. There you go. All right. Go,
[14701.35s -> 14711.75s]  go, go, go, go, go, go. Now stay away from me for a minute. I cannot put a fence here. I actually
[14711.75s -> 14727.72s]  can't put a fence up. Um, I think it's fine. Okay. Well now I can't get over here. All right. I can
[14727.72s -> 14733.72s]  get through that. What's this? All right. Everyone's having a good time. We're all just hanging out.
[14733.72s -> 14751.62s]  Everyone's got put. What are you doing over here? Okay. Are we missing anybody? All right.
[14751.62s -> 14759.86s]  Everybody's in. We got a big yard now. We're ready to go. I need a dog bed. Oh, you look at you.
[14759.86s -> 14779.77s]  Here. Have some deviled eggs and carrots. You need to buy fish. Goldfish. Angel fish. Goldfish.
[14779.77s -> 14810.46s]  Guppy. Discus. Yeah. Get some more fish. Fishy. What about a guppy? Okay. All right. That's all
[14810.46s -> 14822.70s]  I can do. Um, I got a huge yard so I can still. All right. I should get some puppy golden retriever.
[14822.70s -> 14840.25s]  I already have a golden retriever. Labrador. Uh, doofus. Stop rubbing your eyes. I can't help it.
[14840.25s -> 14855.08s]  I need some beds. Um, let's put some new flooring in here. Look, everyone's having such a good time.
[14855.08s -> 14867.61s]  How's the iguana doing? All right. Build food. Get some eye drops. I'm currently streaming right
[14867.61s -> 14888.95s]  now. Is anybody even in here? There's nobody in. What's supposed to go in here? Don't go over there.
[14888.95s -> 14901.42s]  The snake got out. There's no snake. I didn't buy one. I didn't buy a snake. I didn't buy a snake.
[14901.42s -> 14940.55s]  Come get it. Come get it. Oh, they're all trying to get it. Who's gonna get it? Here. Have one of
[14940.55s -> 14956.89s]  these. Okay. Cool. How are you doing? Okay. I need, um, why is there so much shit over here?
[14956.89s -> 14968.55s]  What's happening? How come nobody's using their litter boxes? There's a shit directly
[14968.55s -> 14987.19s]  next to the litter box. All right. We're fine. Let's get the downstairs rolling because that's
[14987.19s -> 14994.68s]  where a lot of beds are going to go for the dogs. Oh, cool. Look at this. Oh my goodness.
[14994.68s -> 15026.87s]  Do I have to? How do I feed them? Yeah. Look, doofus. It's fishes. Good dog, doofus. He got it.
[15026.87s -> 15041.83s]  I love doofus. Oh no. What's wrong? Why do you look so sad? What's wrong? Yeah. Want a biscuit?
[15041.83s -> 15058.84s]  We need some more recreation down here. All right. We need recreation. Everybody watch out.
[15058.84s -> 15066.36s]  Careful. Not everybody come in here at the same time. All right. Let's just dog beds. I need some
[15066.36s -> 15072.46s]  beds. Let's make it a little more comfortable down here too. Carpets. I know people are going to go,
[15072.46s -> 15076.58s]  what are you talking about? I want to be nice and comfortable. I'll get steam cleaned once a fucking
[15076.58s -> 15100.33s]  week. There's going to be beds down here. There'd be toys. It's going to be awesome. This is where
[15100.97s -> 15120.23s]  there's going to be tons of space. Okay. Looks good so far. So this is going to be another
[15120.87s -> 15127.75s]  different animal room. Get it up to the wall here. There's so much room down here as well. All right.
[15127.75s -> 15135.11s]  So now we're going to do, please have the rats in the basement. Yeah. The rats are going to be in
[15135.11s -> 15142.79s]  here, but if I'm going to have like five dogs, I need a ton of space. So let's go ahead and get
[15142.79s -> 15158.60s]  some dog stuff. Okay. Sleeping mat. Here we go. Yeah. Everybody's going to have a little spot.
[15158.60s -> 15167.85s]  There we go. Right there. Everybody's going to get a little space. We'll go with a little smaller
[15167.85s -> 15176.34s]  one. Some dogs like the little beds. They don't want the huge ones. That was stereo. Yeah. Like
[15176.34s -> 15185.50s]  a little one. Yeah. Like this. Some dogs like just like the mat, right? Perfect. Okay. Sleeping
[15185.50s -> 15200.02s]  quarters here. That's good. He's clueless. What do we mean? They can't go down the stairs. Why not?
[15200.02s -> 15226.79s]  Follow me. Can you not go down the stairs? They can't go downstairs. What? So when it's time for
[15226.79s -> 15233.80s]  bed, I have to pick each one of them up individually and bring them down to bed? Swap the reptiles for
[15233.80s -> 15253.14s]  the dog beds. Okay. Maybe I should do that. Should I swap the dog beds? I didn't leave them down
[15253.14s -> 15269.62s]  there. I'm going to go get them. Yeah. I'm going to have to swap. Why are you a different color?
[15269.62s -> 15305.16s]  The iguana is a different color. All right. I'm going, I'm swapping. You dope. This is just
[15305.16s -> 15329.14s]  temporary until I get everything down here. Do not, don't go in there. What are you eating? Don't eat.
[15329.38s -> 15339.72s]  What are you eating? All right. Come with me. He's going to jump in. Doofus ate the iguana.
[15340.68s -> 15351.24s]  No, the iguana is up in there. Fine. Let's move the beds. I'm going to make this more comfortable
[15351.24s -> 15359.88s]  because it shouldn't be a wooden floor. Let's go with some carpet. Let me get nice and comfy.
[15367.37s -> 15382.46s]  I can stay with that gray. That's fine. I'm going to repaint this whole room. All right. Yeah. I'm
[15382.46s -> 15388.14s]  going to make this a little comfier. What do you mean? This is not carpet. Gray fitted carpet.
[15388.14s -> 15394.98s]  That's carpet. What are you talking about? This is ugly. Yeah. Well, it's, this doesn't, it's not
[15394.98s -> 15413.24s]  going to be this insanely. What is that? I can stay. Okay. Dog beds coming up. Perfect spot.
[15413.24s -> 15433.88s]  And the cat beds can come in here too, probably. Right there. All right. Bring a couple of cat
[15433.88s -> 15460.23s]  beds in here. Oh, okay. I'll come back. Change the color of the room. I will. I don't need this.
[15460.23s -> 15466.89s]  Okay. How are we doing? Plenty of food, plenty of water. Does anyone want to play with this?
[15466.89s -> 15476.92s]  Why won't anybody go up here? The house keeps getting worse. I'm in the middle of
[15476.92s -> 15487.72s]  handling it. I just didn't understand. Hidden room off the kitchen. Where is this hidden room?
[15487.72s -> 15494.22s]  There's no way. This is my fucking bedroom, dude. Do I even need a bedroom? What was the,
[15494.22s -> 15508.54s]  what's the point of the bedroom? Okay. And put some toys in here. That can stay there.
[15508.54s -> 15518.39s]  I should just sleep on the floor. Who cares? Where did you get this? You don't have any needs.
[15518.39s -> 15523.88s]  Somebody has needs over here. Who is it? Needs sleep. Oh, we'll go to bed. Go in the,
[15523.88s -> 15542.78s]  go lie down over here. Look, come here. In here. Get some sleep. Right there. That's just like Otto.
[15542.78s -> 15556.68s]  Otto does that too. Little Otto. Okay. Let's put a few toys in there. Is this rabbit shit or is
[15556.68s -> 15565.08s]  this cat shit? I don't know. This floor has to be a different color than shit brown. It's kind of,
[15565.08s -> 15621.99s]  it's changing right now. These? Okay. At least I can see the shit on the ground. The door doesn't
[15621.99s -> 15629.70s]  go anywhere. I know. I haven't fixed it yet. I'm in the process of getting this done. My game is
[15629.70s -> 15637.83s]  lagging. There's too many animals in this house. We have some comfortable living space now. Tons
[15637.83s -> 15650.55s]  of room over here. Did you just? Go in the dog bed. So now let's see. What else do I want?
[15650.55s -> 15660.10s]  You need more animals. I mean, I want, I need space to accommodate them. Okay. Rodents. Hamster.
[15660.10s -> 15673.45s]  There's no rats. I think the game is having trouble loading any more animals. The game does
[15673.45s -> 15683.45s]  not want to load any more animals. It doesn't like that I have 10 already. Fill the house with
[15683.45s -> 15694.12s]  spiders. All right. Let me move this out of the way. Can I not put any more? That's kind of annoying.
[15694.12s -> 15721.50s]  What's wrong with this? Excuse me. How is that not enough room? I don't, I don't get it. There's
[15721.50s -> 15753.13s]  plenty of room. Ceiling is too low. Light. Can I not put any more animals in? Dude, what is the
[15753.13s -> 15774.02s]  problem with nothing on the wall? Whatever. Can I go back to the, I want to get some, um, spiders
[15774.02s -> 15807.53s]  and rats and stuff. Oh, there we go. Okay. So let's see. Spiders. Spidey. So somebody said,
[15807.53s -> 15815.99s]  I love how you're putting the gross animals down here. Where? Ah, he's right there. I see him. Oh,
[15815.99s -> 15841.00s]  what the fuck? Oh, I don't like that. Don't let it out. Don't let it out. Why is it on the floor?
[15841.00s -> 15845.64s]  Cause I need to, I'm just temporarily, I just want to see if it did. All right. I have a snake
[15846.20s -> 15871.38s]  room. Okay. This one's fine. I have one already. Slimy. Morbius. Fine. It's the only time you're
[15871.38s -> 15882.95s]  going to get that. All right. Where's the, where is he? There's a snake. Oh, there you are. You eat
[15882.95s -> 15899.35s]  eggs. That's cool. All right. It's the turtle. I can probably put a few turtles down here if I
[15899.35s -> 15922.30s]  wanted to. Okay. There's the iguana. Spiders. I need the computer down here. You can go out there.
[15922.30s -> 15934.81s]  It's fine. You can go outside. Go for it. Stop shitting next to the food. It's not happy. Here.
[15934.81s -> 15955.37s]  Look, go get it. Come here. How do I, how about play with yarn? You want to play with yarn? Oh,
[15955.37s -> 15964.86s]  there you go. You're happy now. Okay. People are happy. Yeah, they have litter box. Somebody,
[15964.86s -> 15969.86s]  what's wrong with you? What's going on? You need, you're not happy and you just sleep. Well,
[15969.86s -> 15981.21s]  go lie down. Nice catch. Go lie down over here. There's a nice bed just waiting for you and you
[15981.69s -> 15995.00s]  go lie in it. Go to sleep. So cute. I know, I know that's your favorite bone, but you need to go lie
[15995.00s -> 16007.50s]  down. It doesn't want to go to sleep. All right. Who else is here? Who else needs something? No
[16007.50s -> 16017.24s]  needs. No needs. So then we'll, oh, they were hungry. Okay. You still need to go to sleep.
[16017.24s -> 16027.05s]  Go to bed. Everyone else is fine except for you. No, you're fine too. So what's wrong with you?
[16027.05s -> 16035.85s]  What's going on here? No needs. Okay. So you need to go to sleep. All right. Let's go. Um,
[16035.85s -> 16053.30s]  it's kind of dirty over here, isn't it? It's dirty as hell over here. I think it's outside the house.
[16053.30s -> 16068.01s]  The beds are backwards. I don't know how that's possible by the way. I don't know what you mean.
[16068.01s -> 16102.33s]  Like you were right. What? There is no backwards. It's a rectangle actually backwards. That's
[16102.33s -> 16107.19s]  ridiculous. Okay. Well, whatever. I'm going to move this temporarily out here. So there's an extra
[16107.19s -> 16123.35s]  bed back down here. You look good. I need to organize this area. So I want, let's put like,
[16123.35s -> 16140.68s]  I should go down there. I'm taking the computer downstairs. Be good. Okay. How much money do I
[16140.68s -> 16170.94s]  have? Birds. Should I have birds down here? No. How many more spiders should I have? 50? I don't
[16170.94s -> 16183.96s]  think I can have 50. There are no more spiders left to buy. Okay. What about rodents? Hamster? Yep.
[16183.96s -> 16209.98s]  Definitely going to have a hamster. Oh my God. That's big. Um, we'll put some hamsters in here.
[16209.98s -> 16217.50s]  Oh, all right. You need a light. I'm definitely going to not have the snake be in this room.
[16217.50s -> 16238.47s]  No, that's not happening. Are you in here? Okay. You're in here and you have an egg, right? Yep.
[16238.47s -> 16245.16s]  You're good. It's dark down here. I'm going to put some lights in here. There's the turtle. There's
[16245.16s -> 16249.37s]  the hamster. It's too dark in here. Let's get some light. Get a guinea pig. Yeah, I'll get a
[16249.37s -> 16260.10s]  guinea pig. Just something basic. Yeah, this is fine. Just basic shit. Just like Minecraft
[16260.10s -> 16298.78s]  fucking torches. It doesn't matter. There we go. Can I play with the hamster? I think I can just
[16298.78s -> 16312.79s]  watch. So cute. Okay. There are the three spiders. There is my snake, the iguana. All right. What
[16312.79s -> 16333.02s]  else can I buy? Okay. Let's guinea pig. Uh, this one looks good. Um, frumpy. Oh my God. This is way
[16333.02s -> 16354.09s]  too big. This is a children's playground. This is not an enclosure for a guinea pig. Cool. Well,
[16354.09s -> 16386.84s]  have fun in here. Oh, fucking alien. They need, they need way more space than people think.
[16386.84s -> 16405.64s]  Did they really? This is a huge enclosure. I hope, I hope they're very happy. Okay. What else? I don't
[16405.64s -> 16426.47s]  need any more turtles. Another hamster? No. How about another, how about a husky? Um, husko. No
[16426.47s -> 16447.19s]  rats? Yeah, there's no rats. How about some birds? I think I've, should I put birds? Okay. I'm going
[16447.19s -> 16455.19s]  to get some birds in here. Guys, I haven't slept in five days. I need to, I need to fix the bedroom.
[16455.19s -> 16482.26s]  Where can this even go? Holy shit. Guys, I, this can't go anywhere. Wait, do they actually want
[16482.26s -> 16516.46s]  to be outside though? Okay. Let's get some birds. What are you doing down here? Okay. Here's a parrot.
[16516.46s -> 16530.71s]  Tweety. Thanks to your good care, your pet David is growing up. Please remember that all pets,
[16530.71s -> 16551.86s]  regardless of age, need much attention. Who? Who's David? Oh, it's David. Hey, you look,
[16552.26s -> 16564.90s]  you're an adult cat. Oh, that was so fun. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[16564.90s -> 16572.66s]  right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I need to, I need to, I need to buy a few more
[16572.66s -> 16600.38s]  birds and then I got to take care of everybody. Um, they're all just parrots, flappy and slippy.
[16600.38s -> 16618.02s]  All right. I need you to come with me. What are you looking at? Okay. You're good. Come with me.
[16618.02s -> 16623.64s]  I thought that was a huge shit log. I was about to say, oh my God, are you okay? You've been in here
[16623.64s -> 16658.68s]  for a long time. You all right? What's going on? Why can't I, um, what's happening? What's
[16662.25s -> 16668.31s]  going on? Why do you just, do you don't want to treat? Oh no. What's happening? How do I fix this?
[16668.31s -> 16701.75s]  Come with me. Come with me. I can't pick the cat up. What do I do? Well, how do I fix this?
[16701.75s -> 16724.44s]  Too many pets of room is still walled off. Um, okay. They're fine. Did they actually, would they
[16724.44s -> 16739.66s]  want to come out? No, right? No, no, no. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's take care
[16739.66s -> 16749.50s]  of everybody. Everyone seems to be okay. What can I do for you? Uh, watch out. Okay. Come here.
[16749.50s -> 16763.26s]  There you go. Okay. You look like you're having a good time. Here, have some yarn. How are you
[16763.26s -> 16784.01s]  doing? You need to go to sleep. Get some sleep. There's tons of bed over here. Go check the beds
[16784.01s -> 16789.24s]  out over here. There's like three that are over here. Everybody's happy. They just, one of them
[16789.24s -> 16815.05s]  is a little tired. How are you doing? Everybody's relatively happy. Have some food. So now we'll go
[16815.05s -> 16823.30s]  get some sleep. Where are you going? What do you need? Come here. All right. Now we're going to
[16823.30s -> 16828.17s]  give four or five of them to the animal person, right? Cause he's like, you take care of them
[16828.17s -> 16838.47s]  for a while and then I can come get them, right? What's going on over here? They need to go to,
[16838.47s -> 16847.26s]  okay. Some of you need to go to sleep. How are you doing? You're doing good. You're holding so much
[16847.26s -> 16862.57s]  shit in your pocket. You got plenty of food. You do too. How are you guys doing? Oh, there you go.
[16862.57s -> 16870.73s]  Delicious water. Do I, I don't have to fill food on this one. How are you doing? You still have
[16870.73s -> 16886.63s]  food, right? Was the whole ground just food? No. Hay is food. Get another guinea pig. No,
[16886.63s -> 16894.46s]  I'm not, there's no, I'm not getting any more animals. I am at capacity. How are you doing?
[16894.46s -> 16903.22s]  Good. Snake is taking a little rest. No, I'm not getting any more. There's no, this is it.
[16903.22s -> 16911.93s]  You've got your salad there. Okay. How are you doing over here? I can't put food in here. I think
[16911.93s -> 16925.53s]  it's just automatic. How are you doing? Yeah. Everyone that has needs needs to sleep, but they
[16925.53s -> 16936.30s]  won't go in the bed. Okay. So now where's my laptop? The guinea pig needs a friend. No,
[16936.30s -> 16941.32s]  I'm not getting any more. No more animals. No, no more. This is it. This is what I can reliably
[16941.32s -> 16961.83s]  take care of. So now, so now what some of them can go. Cause I took them from his hotel, right?
[16961.83s -> 16972.47s]  I was like housing them for a little while. The doorways are too small. Adopt a child. Okay.
[16972.47s -> 16984.82s]  Where are my animals? Oh, here we go. Okay. So then somebody comes in and adopts them.
[16984.82s -> 16993.93s]  Who, where's David? Oh, this is kind of cool. All right. So David, you want to find a new
[16993.93s -> 17010.73s]  home for David? Yeah. Let's get David a nice home. Did I do it? I think Fred needs a nice home too.
[17010.73s -> 17020.70s]  Okay. Scrumptious is going to stick around. Who else needs like, I've been, I've been taking care
[17020.70s -> 17029.22s]  of them and I want them to have good homes. Perfect. I think perfect could get a new, a good home.
[17029.22s -> 17038.01s]  Bugs. Oh, I was like, what, why are they bugs? We'll get bugs should probably have a new home.
[17038.01s -> 17048.12s]  Yeah. I'm like an adoption place, right? I'm like helping the guy with like his adoption stuff.
[17048.12s -> 17057.35s]  Okay. Octavius, you've been a very, very good, good dog. Let's get you a new home. Who should
[17057.35s -> 17066.70s]  I stick around with? Fishy can stay. I think, I think doofus. Don't sell them. I'm not selling
[17066.70s -> 17076.39s]  them. What are you talking about? You're deleting them. I'm not, I'm not deleting them. They're
[17076.39s -> 17090.62s]  finding new homes. What are you talking about? Yeah. I want to make sure they have good homes.
[17090.62s -> 17096.60s]  I don't want to have too many that I can't take care of. I want them to have good homes.
[17096.60s -> 17105.67s]  Okay. Let's pick this up. They have plenty of food, right? All right. Let's take,
[17105.67s -> 17118.90s]  let's do some playtime. So I think somebody grew up. Yeah. All, all the needs are just sleep,
[17118.90s -> 17136.04s]  sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep. Come over here and play with the mouse. Go get it. Adopt. Yeah. I'm,
[17136.04s -> 17140.04s]  I thought I was like a foster house and then they would come and I would put them up for adoption.
[17140.04s -> 17146.55s]  That's what I'm doing. How are you doing? Sleep. Let me guess. They, okay. They, they don't sleep
[17146.55s -> 17160.01s]  and then they get unhappy because they're tired. Do I need more beds? I need more litter boxes.
[17160.01s -> 17164.20s]  Okay. I'm going to add two more litter boxes over here. The dogs don't, the dogs just go out,
[17164.20s -> 17177.54s]  right? You're happy. Everybody seems pretty happy over here. Hungry. Okay. You're really bored. I
[17177.54s -> 17189.91s]  keep, hold on. Come here. Come over here. Go get it. Go get it. Yeah. Who's going to get the ball?
[17189.91s -> 17208.81s]  Oh, the bunny, bunny got adopted, right? What's wrong? Do you want a treat? There we go. Okay.
[17208.81s -> 17217.45s]  Very good. You have the same eyes as the Among Us guy because we're the same person. Okay. Everyone
[17217.45s -> 17222.62s]  seems to be in pretty good spirits. I think you guys are just tired. Yes. Okay. You're tired and
[17222.62s -> 17232.55s]  I think you're tired too. Yes. All right. So let me clean up your area here. I think, I think it's
[17232.55s -> 17240.47s]  time for Doofus to get adopted. Doofus needs a little bit more room. Yeah. Doofus needs some
[17240.47s -> 17260.15s]  more room. You want a treat? No, please. No, no. Someone else. Oh, look. Lassie, uh, grew up. You
[17260.15s -> 17269.40s]  need to get some sleep. Please. Not Doofus. What about, um, what about Husko? I think Husko needs,
[17269.40s -> 17289.66s]  Husko needs a lot of room. Yep. All right, Husko. We're going to get you a good family. Okay.
[17289.66s -> 17307.00s]  Where's Husko? All right, everybody. Let's find Husko a home. Oh, let me go to the birds. Birds
[17307.00s -> 17318.70s]  need a little bit of, uh, a little bit of care, I think. Right. I want to get out of the, please
[17318.70s -> 17333.26s]  let me get out of the laptop. You monster. What? I'm getting them in better homes. Here you go. Have
[17333.26s -> 17349.29s]  some food. Copium. What do you mean? What? I'm taking care of them until we can find them. I'm
[17349.29s -> 17356.38s]  fostering them until we can find them better homes. I'm not deleting them. It does not say
[17356.38s -> 17369.93s]  delete this dog. It says find a home. I'm not, nobody, what are you talking about? Here, have
[17369.93s -> 17381.18s]  some. Oh, you already have, do you already have food? Yeah, you're tired. Are you tired too? Yeah,
[17381.18s -> 17403.37s]  they're both just tired. Home. Copium. Huh? It says have them find a better, a new home. Look,
[17403.37s -> 17412.47s]  that's what it says. Morgan's Pet Care. I'm currently fostering animals and it says, okay,
[17412.47s -> 17420.50s]  so here's who is at my house. Find a new home. It doesn't, I didn't, move to hotel. Move to hotel
[17420.50s -> 17432.65s]  would be, no, this is, they come in and they, that's not what it says. It's not a funeral home.
[17432.65s -> 17444.36s]  Stop. You guys are fucked. Show us the homes. I don't, there's not that much in this. What?
[17444.36s -> 17471.69s]  Oh shit, I just went to sleep. Ah, bugs. Do you actually see the people? This one's really cool
[17471.77s -> 17488.18s]  looking. It's blue and orange. That's crazy. You're good. You're happy. Fill up your hay again.
[17488.18s -> 17495.82s]  Give you some more food. You still have leaves there. Hello. What's this guy's name? Fred.
[17495.82s -> 17511.46s]  What's turtle's name? Hello. I like doofus more than I like lassie. Oh, that was crunch. Right.
[17511.46s -> 17520.15s]  I wish I could take you out and kind of let you run around a little in a safe enclosed space.
[17520.15s -> 17530.47s]  You're doing good. How are you doing in here? It's filled. Oh, right. Fred got adopted. That's
[17530.47s -> 17541.48s]  right. Fred got adopted. Hope you're having a good time, Fred, in your new home. Uh, I just fed you.
[17541.48s -> 17558.42s]  How are you doing? Tired? You want to play here? I love how the dogs want to play with the cat toys
[17558.42s -> 17571.00s]  too. Are you tired doofus? No needs. All right. I think it's time to send out some more. I think
[17571.00s -> 17581.51s]  you're just tired. Yeah. You doofus just won't go to bed. How come doofus won't sleep? He just won't
[17581.51s -> 17590.12s]  go to bed. Fish. Uh, I don't, you don't feed the fish. They just kind of hang out. There's no
[17590.12s -> 17598.54s]  mechanic to feed them. Yeah. These guys are all full up with food. They're all good. How are you?
[17598.54s -> 17607.34s]  Maybe we should get some adoptions going here. Uh, you were adopted so I can get rid of that.
[17618.79s -> 17631.61s]  I, I want to adopt crunch. I want crunch to be adopted from me and I want scrumptious and doofus.
[17631.61s -> 17644.47s]  The rest are going to have good homes. Crunch. I'm keeping crunch. Actually, I'll keep lassie too.
[17644.47s -> 17663.85s]  I'll keep doofus. Uh, it's kind of glitched out. Okay. So I'm going to, I want crunch. I could keep
[17663.85s -> 17672.15s]  scrumptious. Oh, chivius would be so wonderful. Let's get chivius a new home. Eiffel. Eiffel will
[17672.15s -> 17682.84s]  do so good in a new home. Come on in. Adopt. Well, sweetie, we'll keep sweetie. Oh, the fish.
[17682.84s -> 17695.74s]  That's cool. We'll keep doofus. I, we'll keep spidey. We'll adopt out. Uh, we'll keep morbius.
[17695.74s -> 17703.43s]  All right. We have some, anybody want to come in and get the spiders? Oh, that's a hamster. I
[17703.43s -> 17710.90s]  feel like somebody would have a lot of fun with this hamster. Frumpy would have a lot of fun with
[17710.90s -> 17718.79s]  the new owner too. Keep spider four. This is, this is all temporary. I wanted to make sure that I
[17718.79s -> 17725.54s]  could house them. All right. Flappy. I'm going to, I'll keep one of the parrots. I'm going to keep
[17725.54s -> 17735.22s]  tweety. Some of these spiders though, I'll keep the blue spider. We'll find a new home for you.
[17735.22s -> 17739.78s]  The fish can all stay. And I think, I think I'm good. I think, wait, what about peaches?
[17744.50s -> 17754.81s]  They're going to a new home. A new home. This doesn't say a new death. This doesn't say a new
[17754.81s -> 17764.44s]  shelter. They're going to a new home. Home. H-O-M-E. H-O-M-E. H-O-M-E. H-O-M-E. H-O-M-E.
[17764.44s -> 17774.92s]  It doesn't say heaven. It doesn't say, no, it'll find a new H-O-M-E. Home. It says home. How come
[17774.92s -> 17781.66s]  you're adopting animals to give them away? No, I'm working with the pet adoption center. I'm working
[17781.66s -> 17796.17s]  with the adoption center. The new, oh my God. Isn't that guy, that's not adoption center.
[17800.68s -> 17806.84s]  You're being so gaslit right now. I know. And they deserve to be fucking yelled at.
[17806.84s -> 17815.06s]  Okay. So I got rid of this. These are all adopted. Very cool. The only thing, yeah, there was just
[17815.06s -> 17826.76s]  this, you were the only one. Hi. This chat is fucked. He's role playing. Yeah, I'm just,
[17826.76s -> 17836.01s]  I'm role playing. I'm role playing as a person that's like fostering animals and adopting them.
[17836.01s -> 17848.63s]  You deleted them. Where are all the huge dogs? What is the title of this fucking stream? I mean,
[17848.63s -> 17859.75s]  technically this was a huge dog house. So here we go. We've got two dogs, two cats, and our bird
[17859.75s -> 17879.16s]  friend out here. Perfect. Hello. Everyone is happy. Don't need these because I just need one. I don't
[17879.16s -> 17893.14s]  think Doofus has slept since he got here. Okay. Do you want a bigger bed? I wonder if it's, is it
[17893.14s -> 17900.01s]  the size? Does he, do you want a bigger bed? You're kind of a big dog. Are they big beds?
[17900.01s -> 17922.01s]  Open the bedroom. Okay. There we go. I don't even need a bedroom. This can just be another, okay.
[17922.01s -> 17932.68s]  Will you sleep in here if I put a, like a big bed in here? I wanted to get some sleep. Light dog
[17932.68s -> 17948.49s]  sleeping mat. Dog sleeping mat. Dog bed. Dog bed with legs. One of these big ones. Dog, dark dog
[17948.49s -> 17958.28s]  couch woof. Okay. This is extra large. How is that extra large? This doesn't look like an extra large
[17958.28s -> 17988.41s]  bed. That looks like a small bed. Why are these all so small? Okay. Hi. Yeah. He's not on follow.
[17990.41s -> 17995.69s]  Yeah. Get some, go get some rest. How are you doing? You doing happy? Doing good? Hey, look,
[17995.69s -> 18021.50s]  look at this. Oh, oh, are you gonna get it? Are you gonna get it? A little scrumptious. Are you
[18021.50s -> 18044.34s]  gonna go to bed? Finally? Good cat. I think you grew up. No, he's not on follow. Oh, snoozing. Keep
[18044.34s -> 18056.18s]  it open for now. You're doing okay. You're doing all right, but you're probably hungry. Yeah, come
[18056.18s -> 18071.93s]  over here. Want to play some yarn? Get it. Yeah, I don't, he's not on follow. Come here. Come with me.
[18071.93s -> 18077.61s]  I know you're very excited. It's very exciting stuff, but come over here. We'll put you in. It's
[18077.61s -> 18082.76s]  gonna be a quiet little space right over here. I know it's very exciting, but you should go
[18082.76s -> 18094.14s]  lie right in here. It's very exciting. There you go. Go on, lie down. Oh, no, get out of here.
[18094.14s -> 18106.17s]  He's trying to sleep. He doesn't want to go to bed. He's not on follow. Look, you just turn the
[18106.17s -> 18120.65s]  lights off. He's just too excited. Okay. Come over here and go lie in bed. I'm telling you.
[18120.65s -> 18142.92s]  Follow me. Okay. Follow me. Have they all been on follow me the whole time? Every single one?
[18142.92s -> 18158.84s]  I thought it was, I thought I had to click the follow me or click this. Really? What? No,
[18159.48s -> 18174.71s]  I didn't know that. I thought it was, but their default set to follow me. Okay. So in my brain,
[18174.79s -> 18183.62s]  this is not follow me, right? It's, he's under stay. See? I thought it was just,
[18184.97s -> 18202.04s]  now he's following me. He's so happy. I'm so happy. Thank God. Okay. So there you go.
[18202.04s -> 18210.42s]  You may have been the light switch. I think this room was off for a while too though.
[18210.42s -> 18220.33s]  How's everybody doing? Good. Just checking on everybody down here. Looking good. You still
[18220.33s -> 18236.65s]  have your egg. How are you anyways? How are you doing? Good. Just chilling. Don't do any more
[18236.65s -> 18266.01s]  adoptions. What? What are you talking about? He is not. He's fine. I think he's, I don't think
[18266.01s -> 18284.89s]  he's dead. I don't think he's dead. No, I don't think so. No, right? I think he's just sitting
[18284.89s -> 18300.62s]  there. I've been coming down here and putting food in and stuff. No, I don't, I don't think
[18300.62s -> 18317.22s]  they can die like that. No, I don't think so. No, look, look. Ready? Watch this. Watch. Ready?
[18317.22s -> 18340.54s]  Crunch is fine. He's fine. Look, this is him right here. It says he's fine. That's just an image.
[18340.54s -> 18346.66s]  No, why would I be able to move him around if he was? I think he's just bugged. I really do.
[18346.66s -> 18362.15s]  I honestly think he's bugged. Watch. Ready? Here's what we'll do. I'll prove it. Check this out.
[18362.15s -> 18370.92s]  Move to the hotel, okay? Pets in the hotel, okay? Pick from the hotel. Go back into your aquarium.
[18370.92s -> 18380.01s]  All these motherfuckers telling me that Crunch was dead. All these motherfuckers telling me
[18380.01s -> 18390.36s]  Crunch was dead. Everybody telling me Crunch was dead. I've been coming down here and been,
[18391.32s -> 18400.50s]  it's fine. Crunch just was, AI just walked into a wall for a second. Dude, you posted Crunch.
[18400.50s -> 18413.69s]  I've been feeding them. I've been having, I was right. I've been hanging out with them. How are
[18413.69s -> 18426.79s]  you doing? Good. I think you're sleeping down here. I think you're asleep down here. Oh no,
[18426.79s -> 18442.44s]  they were adopted. Yeah, everyone trying to tell me that Crunch, Crunch is perfectly fine. In fact,
[18442.44s -> 18446.28s]  let's get, because I know I'm keeping you, I can, you know, I'm going to bring you into the bedroom.
[18446.28s -> 18463.13s]  I think that's, I mean, I don't, nevermind. No, I'm not. Okay. How you doing? Doing good.
[18463.13s -> 18475.30s]  Everyone's doing good. I did, this hamster got adopted. So I can put you back over here in this
[18475.30s -> 18491.35s]  spot right here. Very cool. All right. Look at how happy you are. Very cool. Wanna play? Doofus.
[18491.35s -> 18507.08s]  Why do you hate doofus? How are you? It looks like you both have grown up. Need some sleep.
[18507.08s -> 18513.34s]  Make sure you're not on like follow, wait, so when it says follow me, that means it,
[18513.34s -> 18533.56s]  that they're staying, right? That's correct. So I have to click that. Happy, happy. Here, you wanna
[18533.56s -> 18545.11s]  play? Come, let's come, come outside. Let's get some exercise. Go get it. No, not doofus. Dude,
[18545.11s -> 18554.04s]  of course doofus is going to go get it. All right, doofus. Let's get you some exercise.
[18554.04s -> 18570.90s]  Doofus. There we go. All right. Come on out. Good catch. They don't, they're not really dirty. Yeah,
[18570.90s -> 18575.70s]  they look really clean. I'll get a cleaning station there right here. And then I'm probably
[18575.70s -> 18591.11s]  going to end the stream soon. I feel like I've done everything I wanted to do. You want to,
[18591.11s -> 18604.18s]  oh, well, okay. Well, now you're dirty. That you did not look like this before. Here you go.
[18604.26s -> 18624.84s]  You ready? Let's get clean. Very good. Do you need to clean? I don't think, I don't think you
[18624.84s -> 18630.04s]  do anything with the cats. You want to play? All right, here we go. Ready? This is for you.
[18630.04s -> 18644.89s]  I know I joked about the house, but I hope you had fun making it and the animals are very cute. Yeah,
[18644.89s -> 18664.57s]  it was fun. That's definitely a cool addition to the game. Go get it. Nice patch of grass.
[18667.75s -> 18677.70s]  It's fine. Don't worry. Everybody seems happy. I think, is doofus clean? Do you need to be clean?
[18677.70s -> 18711.78s]  No, you're fine. Fish is doing good. Very good. You don't feed the fish though. Everyone's having
[18711.78s -> 18718.79s]  such a good time. The fish are starving. I can't feed them. They're just, I think there's like an
[18718.79s -> 18727.86s]  auto feeder or something. They never used the cat wall. Yeah, they didn't. How do you, I wonder how
[18727.86s -> 18741.37s]  you get them to use it? Can you put them on it? Um, let me see if anyone will think it's fun.
[18741.37s -> 18749.24s]  Well, you're too tired. I don't want to do that. Where's uh, where's scrumptious? Scrumptious?
[18749.24s -> 18761.86s]  Where's scrumptious? How are you doing out here? You need food? No, you got, they got plenty of food.
[18761.86s -> 18776.02s]  Um, you might be stuck somehow. I think the game maybe has you stuck. Okay, I don't know. How did
[18776.02s -> 18807.88s]  that happen? He's going insane. I'm, hold on. All right. Tweety, we'll, we'll get Tweety adopted.
[18807.88s -> 18817.37s]  I don't, I can't, I can't fix Tweety. Tweety was stuck in the, on the seat or whatever it is. What?
[18817.37s -> 18825.64s]  I'm finding them new homes. You guys are fucked. All right. I think that's probably it. That was
[18825.64s -> 18835.85s]  fun. I didn't want to go too overboard because there's no way I, that was the limit of the
[18835.85s -> 18840.46s]  amount of animals I was able to reliably even take care of in the game. So I didn't want to
[18840.46s -> 18854.94s]  keep adding animals. How could you? Get them all adopted? Well, I, I, I can, I can take care of all
[18854.94s -> 18863.96s]  these. Two dogs, two cats, a couple of lizards. I'm okay with this. I'm not, no, I'm keeping them.
[18863.96s -> 18871.88s]  No, these, these are, these are my best friends. All the other ones were my good friends too, but
[18871.88s -> 18879.11s]  we got them new homes. If you turn the game off, they die. That's not true. They continue to live
[18879.11s -> 18887.26s]  here and have fun. This is a substantial update. I did not think there was going to be this much
[18887.26s -> 18893.34s]  stuff in it. There's a lot. This is really cute. It is really, that was really funny. That was really
[18893.34s -> 18903.29s]  cute. Start a dog sanctuary. Well, that's why I wanted to make sure I had enough beds and enough
[18903.29s -> 18911.66s]  food bowls. Once we got to like three, four dogs in the house, it was like, no more, no more. I
[18911.66s -> 18922.57s]  cannot take care of any more. The cat wall. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who's, um, can I see you
[18922.57s -> 18944.20s]  for a second? Your fridge is so ugly. All right. Will you want to hang out on this? I don't think
[18944.20s -> 18963.00s]  so. No, I just don't think they want to use it. I just don't think they like it. No, they're on
[18963.00s -> 18978.90s]  follow. Are they? Well, these two were playing, so we were just playing. Can I go to bed? Okay.
[18978.90s -> 18988.47s]  It does look cool. All right. Goodbye, Doofus. It has been fun. Goodbye, Scrumptious. Goodbye,
[18988.47s -> 19001.77s]  Doofus. Goodbye, David. Goodbye, Husko. Goodbye, Disc. Goodbye, Flappy. Goodbye, Lassie. Goodbye,
[19001.77s -> 19011.45s]  Crunch. Goodbye, Peaches. Goodnight, Morbius. Goodnight, the other ones, all the other animals.
[19011.45s -> 19022.15s]  Perfect. Goodnight, Fred. Goodnight, Morbius. All right. Yeah, that's it. That's it. That was fun.
[19031.35s -> 19040.31s]  That was a back stretch. Oh yeah, multiverses. Okay. So on Friday, we're going to play multiverses
[19040.31s -> 19051.10s]  for like 40 minutes and then we'll move on to something else. Was that a good stretch? That was
[19051.10s -> 19058.31s]  a really good stretch, actually. I feel great. They're not going to leave the hard drive.
[19058.31s -> 19063.56s]  It's fine. I'll see you guys on Friday. We're going to start with multiverses. I'm going to stream
[19063.56s -> 19068.20s]  earlier than four because if the, if it actually turns off at five o'clock Pacific,
[19068.20s -> 19073.86s]  I want to play for at least a couple hours. We'll start at like three, at least three-ish,
[19073.86s -> 19080.04s]  because I want at least an hour or two. Your arms look really small. Get a little of that.
[19080.04s -> 19094.92s]  Do they? Yeah. What'd you say? Would you excuse, say that again if you could? All right. Goodbye.
[19094.92s -> 19101.70s]  I'll see you guys Friday. That was House Flipper Pets DLC. I didn't even pee for five and a half
[19101.70s -> 19124.31s]  hours. That's kind of weird. It's fun taking care of pets. Who was your favorite? My favorite was
[19124.31s -> 19131.58s]  probably Doofus and Crunch. Mainly Crunch because everybody said he was dead, but he wasn't. He's
[19131.58s -> 19157.66s]  alive and I proved it. So they're my favorites. Scrumptious? Yeah. David? Yeah. So everyone was
[19157.66s -> 19180.87s]  so convinced that Crunch was dead. Unanimous in the chat. Unanimous. Now, see you Friday. We'll
[19180.87s -> 19185.75s]  start with multiverses and then from there, because I'm not going to be able to play that
[19185.75s -> 19194.90s]  game for more than an hour or two, from there we'll probably do, I don't know. I'll take a look at
[19194.90s -> 19201.35s]  the recommended. There's a ton of stuff in there. We'll probably do a pre-stream poll if you're
[19201.35s -> 19215.83s]  around. But yeah, take care of yourselves. Thanks for watching. See you again, hopefully. This stream
[19215.83s -> 19223.24s]  started kind of absurd, but I think we chilled out a little bit halfway through, but it's fun.
[19223.24s -> 19238.38s]  It's fun just to hang out. You should play Ultrakill. Yeah, I mean, if it's not in the
[19238.38s -> 19244.60s]  recommended already, toss it in there. I'll go take a look. What about more infomercials? Yeah,
[19244.60s -> 19254.66s]  we'll do that too. You're in the hospital today. Thanks for cheering me up. Hopefully you're
[19254.66s -> 19265.83s]  all right. Hopefully there's nothing serious or anything. When's the green screen? Green screen
[19265.83s -> 19272.94s]  in front of the green screen night. I'll let you know early this coming week. It's not, I'm not
[19272.94s -> 19277.66s]  going to get in front of the green screen for at least a couple weeks because I want some time
[19277.66s -> 19283.98s]  for people to do actions and I want some time for me to figure out when I want to get in front of
[19283.98s -> 19295.48s]  it. So it'll be at least a week or two from right now at least. Where can we submit actions? So
[19296.44s -> 19311.10s]  in the discord right now we have a channel. It is imminently about to be used. We're going to set
[19311.10s -> 19315.98s]  up a discussion channel to talk about actions. What you want me to do in front of the screen.
[19316.62s -> 19328.39s]  I think it's going to open probably soon. It is a public discord with some sub only channels.
[19329.11s -> 19334.79s]  It is the submissions green screen channel. Go please read the rules. There are a lot of them.
[19336.54s -> 19346.71s]  There are a lot of rules. I will give some more info on this. Well actually we'll talk in detail
[19346.71s -> 19362.46s]  about the kind of what I'm expecting on Friday. Yeah and also check on the already done actions
[19362.46s -> 19367.10s]  before you submit. We've done this two times now. This is the third time. I'm not going to do,
[19368.06s -> 19375.06s]  for instance, I mean maybe I will for my own sake for my own amusement. But if something,
[19375.06s -> 19378.98s]  if it's if I've already done it in front of the screen I'm not going to do it again in a week or
[19378.98s -> 19385.50s]  two. If we already have that footage then if it's already been submitted then think of something
[19385.50s -> 19407.35s]  else. Is it sub only submissions? No it is not. Yeah take care of yourselves. Thanks for watching.
[19408.15s -> 19416.38s]  Take care of your pets. Give your dog and cat some love or if you have any other pets too.
[19416.94s -> 19423.30s]  And I'll see you guys on Friday. And always of course call your mother of course.
[19426.26s -> 19428.10s]  All right good night guys. See you soon.
