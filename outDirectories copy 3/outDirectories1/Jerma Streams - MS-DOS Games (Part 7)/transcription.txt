[1.72s -> 11.54s]  Hello. Is he live? It's not showing up for me. What up? I'm here. Refresh.
[12.34s -> 27.66s]  Hey, ready? Just see. Good afternoon, guys. How you doing? We have actually quite a few things to
[27.66s -> 35.50s]  talk about before we go forward with this, uh, this Tuesday. That's right. We're playing DOS today,
[36.46s -> 46.09s]  but stuff to discuss. Most important thing number one is a lot of people are gonna be
[46.09s -> 50.73s]  not happy about this, but I have to say it. You know, I'll wait. I'm gonna wait. I'll wait to
[50.73s -> 58.33s]  disappoint a shitload of people when we will lie for at least two or three minutes. I'm about to
[58.33s -> 67.58s]  disappoint everybody. Well, maybe not. No, maybe not. You got to tell us now. Just hold on. Hold
[67.66s -> 80.73s]  on. I'll tell you in a second. No, I'm not moving platforms. Why would I open up a stream like that?
[82.07s -> 86.71s]  Oh, hey guys. Uh, Gerber here. I just want to say I'm going to disappoint the fuck out of everybody
[86.71s -> 95.69s]  here. Wouldn't I do? I at least have to be like, Hey guys, move into X, move into Y, come on over.
[96.33s -> 99.37s]  I, why would I start with, Hey, you guys are going to be really disappointed in me.
[108.22s -> 116.17s]  So, um, all right. Well, it's been enough time. We've got like 6,000 people. That's fine. So, uh,
[117.50s -> 121.02s]  just say it, just get it out. I'm going to, I'm going to breathe in once and I'm going to say it.
[121.02s -> 130.73s]  The green screen stream is delayed. There you go. Okay. It's done. Uh, sorry. Uh, there's a reason
[130.73s -> 138.98s]  for it over the last like week and a half or so since this diagnosis, I've been doing stretches
[139.78s -> 146.66s]  and I've been doing some exercises to help target the issue that I have in my back and chest.
[147.70s -> 155.16s]  It has shrunk my mobility down pretty low. I'm very sore and I can't really move around
[156.04s -> 160.12s]  and like do a bunch of crazy shit, standing up and moving around and stuff.
[160.92s -> 168.68s]  So that's the reason why, uh, hopefully over the next few weeks that I could loosen up a little
[168.68s -> 178.86s]  and I'll get there. So it's still going to happen. I just need to loosen up a bit
[179.83s -> 184.39s]  because right now, uh, these exact exercises and stretches that I'm doing,
[185.59s -> 189.35s]  it like kind of hurts to breathe in all the way and like turn and look.
[190.23s -> 192.71s]  So there's no way I'm going to be like, here we go. Well, look at me,
[192.71s -> 197.40s]  here we get in front of the green screen. It's just not going to happen. But Hey, here,
[197.40s -> 201.24s]  babe, hold on. Let me immediately make you, make you happy again. Hold on here. Time to turn that
[201.24s -> 210.49s]  around. Uh, the Minecraft stream is still on pace for the 15th. So that's good. And that's
[210.49s -> 219.70s]  some good news. Actually, I'm going to be testing out the server either tonight or tomorrow. I'm
[219.70s -> 223.22s]  going to do some stress testing to it. We're going to fuck around with it. It's going to be
[223.22s -> 231.67s]  a fun experiment. Now that that's out of the way, that's a POG for me. Yeah. So that's out of the
[231.67s -> 238.82s]  way. Let's, uh, let's get to it. Those of you that are new to the channel, be like,
[239.85s -> 249.69s]  but like four months ago, four or five months ago, we used to play dos games once a week
[251.13s -> 257.29s]  lasted for three or four weeks in a row. And I'm going to do it again because a shitload
[257.29s -> 264.18s]  more games have been added to this archive list, like thousands of them. So I just went to sort
[264.18s -> 272.07s]  by newest additions and then we're just going to go take a look. Here's another little problem
[272.07s -> 279.67s]  with this stream today though. Um, there are, there are some pornography thumbnails, so just
[279.67s -> 289.40s]  got to be careful. I'm going to skim them first. Newest addition does not mean also censored,
[291.18s -> 297.90s]  but I actually, I already have a few queued up here. Uh, and by a few, I mean a lot because I
[297.90s -> 302.30s]  also went back and picked out some of the ones that we didn't do, but ones that I maybe should
[302.30s -> 308.14s]  have spent more time in some of the more popular ones. I know this is not one of them, but, uh,
[308.14s -> 314.30s]  let's just get to it. This first one, after we talk about turkeys, five community turkey subs,
[314.30s -> 320.65s]  happy Thanksgiving turkey and Zorro. Thank you for the five community subs, both of you
[321.21s -> 328.39s]  back to back. Let's go. This first one is, I don't know how long I'm going to play for,
[330.36s -> 338.68s]  but we'll see. Uh, the first one was called make a monster. This is the monster maker.
[341.66s -> 349.56s]  Make a monster, write a monster myth in your monster museum. So this one's going to be
[349.56s -> 353.85s]  fucking real exciting. All right, make a monster. Is there no sound in this one?
[357.54s -> 363.45s]  No background, background one, background two. We'll do background three. Use the right mouse
[363.45s -> 368.81s]  button or the space bar to view backgrounds. Use left mouse button or the enter key to choose a
[368.81s -> 377.94s]  background. I like that one. Oh, coming out of the spaceship. That's pretty good. Inside the
[377.94s -> 382.62s]  spaceship on the planet. Why is that? Why do they all have to be from a different planet? Why can
[382.62s -> 390.60s]  it be from earth? All right. I like this one. All right. How about bodies? Let's see. Bubbles, ears,
[391.40s -> 408.38s]  eyes, headgear, kids. What is, what is kids? Why would it be a kid? Is this, is this is clip art?
[409.50s -> 422.90s]  Okay. Here. How do I get away? How do I get out of kids? How do I get out of this menu? How do I
[422.90s -> 436.12s]  get out of here? Can you make it smaller? I, I don't think so. Oh shit. Make it bigger. You can't.
[437.46s -> 447.10s]  Is it escape tab? Oh, there we go. It's back, backspace. No, no, no. All right. We're learning
[447.10s -> 454.04s]  here. Ooh, I just accidentally space or right mouse, but view clip art. It actually is clip art.
[454.68s -> 464.34s]  View previous. Move clip art. One to nine. Change distance. Clip art is moved. Backspace removed.
[464.34s -> 471.88s]  V is flip. H is flip. S toggles shadow. C select clip art shadow. F1 help escape exit.
[472.70s -> 482.31s]  Oh, okay. So, uh, we're going to have to, we're going to have to lower it out. We have to lower
[482.31s -> 486.31s]  it up. And I, if I just leaked the rest of the fucking games, who cares? You didn't even look,
[486.31s -> 492.20s]  don't look up there. Don't peek at your presence. All right. Let's do, uh, legs one.
[492.92s -> 504.89s]  No, I need body. Actually, I kind of like this one.
[512.90s -> 522.49s]  All right. How about headgear? Lego hair. I'm just going to stay out of the menu. It doesn't
[522.49s -> 534.26s]  really matter. I got to bring this down. Is that a clown nose? Okay. That's like a clown horn.
[535.77s -> 553.78s]  Uh, okay. So you got a clown horn. Let's do, what about arms? Mouths? All right. Hold on. Arms too.
[562.20s -> 574.70s]  Okay. I'm not going to lie. I actually kind of like this game. All right. That one.
[576.97s -> 580.57s]  What was, what's this one? Hold on. No, no, no, no, no. Back, back, back, back, back.
[583.96s -> 590.87s]  Look at how easily entertained he is. Am I? Look, he's going up there to honk the nose.
[596.89s -> 606.14s]  This is so stupid. You're right. This sucks, but who cares? I'm having fun. The tabs,
[606.14s -> 613.08s]  Jerma, the tabs. It's, it's already leaked. What do you, you, what? I'm going to pretend it didn't
[613.08s -> 627.59s]  leak? Erasers. What does that mean? This is, what is it? A watermelon? What is this?
[629.54s -> 638.87s]  Big dog ears? Is that a mustache? I don't understand. Crop the browser. Well, here's the
[638.87s -> 644.06s]  thing. I can't. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You know what? I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. All right.
[644.06s -> 647.02s]  I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. All right. I can't, I can't,
[647.02s -> 672.10s]  I can't. Hold on. There. There we go. Okay. No, this doesn't work. All right. Yeah. He'll have
[672.10s -> 678.65s]  like a, he'll have a Polaroid camera. No, no. I don't like any of these. None of them. Don't
[678.65s -> 714.20s]  want any of them. Eyes. I like these. It's like sonic eyes. These are 10 new emotes coming up.
[715.46s -> 719.30s]  No, that's not true. Should I, what, what, the infected eyes? What do you think?
[725.30s -> 733.59s]  Hey, Jeff, thanks for the five community subs, Jeff. Thanks a lot, Jeff. These aren't bad.
[739.75s -> 743.11s]  There's a lot of eyes. I would have so much fun playing with this if I was a kid.
[743.83s -> 760.26s]  Okay. Done. Now what about, what is bubbles supposed to be? Well, like they were in like a bath.
[760.90s -> 773.19s]  I don't understand. Like, oh, thought bubbles. Okay. All right. How about what else is up here?
[773.83s -> 786.12s]  All right. We're good. Done. Okay. Done. Now say edit speech. What do you mean edit speech?
[786.84s -> 820.36s]  Press tab to switch between words. Say ASDF to hear your word. Add new word. Say as what?
[827.66s -> 838.01s]  Select text. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Change speech. Edit speech. Alt H. Turn on.
[838.57s -> 899.00s]  Spell the word. Say the word. Say the page. Okay. Whoa. What happened? What happened? Where do we go?
[899.00s -> 916.98s]  What? Did it open a new tab? Oh, no. Google. Google.com. Ouch. There's so much info on this
[916.98s -> 927.58s]  screen. Fuck. These are all the cards I sent out. We know you use Chrome. I have to use Chrome. It's
[927.58s -> 947.86s]  easily. Hold on. There we go. How do I get it to say the words? Say it. Alt W. Now Alt T is saved.
[947.86s -> 955.83s]  I'm not, I don't know how to press Alt W. What does Alt W do? What does Alt W do? Because I,
[955.83s -> 969.46s]  Ctrl T opens new random tab. Alt W does what now? All right. How do I? Where's help?
[972.86s -> 984.44s]  Alt W say the word. Alt S spell. Alt T. Change speech. Let's do change speech. Oh my God.
[990.58s -> 1009.16s]  Come on. Say it. Do something. We need to hear this. Do the roar. Do the roar.
[1012.90s -> 1026.38s]  It's Ctrl W? No, it's not. It's Alt W. Move the cursor over the word to. Okay. Hold on.
[1036.71s -> 1057.96s]  Type in, what does Alt W do in Chrome? What does Alt W do? It's Ctrl W? It depends on your add-ons.
[1058.92s -> 1060.92s]  It presses Alt W.
[1065.53s -> 1093.53s]  It closes the tab. It doesn't do anything. God damn it. Alt W. No. Oh well. We could have got a funny
[1093.53s -> 1109.70s]  voice out of this one. Alt T. I did Alt T. It opened up another Google tab. All right. Oh well.
[1115.45s -> 1121.29s]  Alt. Yeah. Well, what else? Yeah. All right. Let's get out of this one. All right. This one sucks.
[1239.24s -> 1260.39s]  When did I mute? Oh, it's this Mario. It's okay. This kind of hurts my ears. You unmuted the whole
[1260.39s -> 1274.62s]  stream. That would suck. Why would you need 80 lives? 80. Okay. Well, now we only have 79 lives
[1274.62s -> 1290.39s]  left. What are we going to do? The game is hard. Can I just get one enemy killed? Aren't they
[1290.39s -> 1309.46s]  lobsters? Well, no. They're lobsters or crabs in one of the games. That's not made up. Yes. Yes,
[1309.46s -> 1324.49s]  I'm correct. I know. That's a fucked up pixel. That was stupid. I hit it. I actually hit it.
[1325.21s -> 1345.02s]  You even saw the thing go up. You can't actually see it. All right. This is not like Mario Galaxy
[1345.98s -> 1351.69s]  that has the mini game that they've... You know what? I'm not even going to explain it. I just
[1351.69s -> 1361.30s]  got so angry that I couldn't even explain what I was trying to say. Long story short, it's fucking
[1361.30s -> 1365.94s]  hard to control. And I was about to go off on like a rant about how they've remade this like
[1365.94s -> 1376.07s]  10 times. This is the VGA version. I got stuck. I got mad stuck. I was just like...
[1378.87s -> 1406.66s]  I'm playing gold next. Uh, okay. EGA? CGA? Tandy! What is the Hercules graphics adapter? Should
[1406.66s -> 1420.90s]  I do the Hercules? Does that mean it's the best one? All right. Hercules. Uh, I can't do any of
[1420.90s -> 1440.49s]  these. Why can't I not do any of them? Click on the screen? Yeah. That doesn't... It's not doing
[1440.49s -> 1453.16s]  anything. Numpad? No. Numpad's not working either. All right. How do I do it? Golden Axe is a...
[1453.16s -> 1461.00s]  Golden Axe. Golden Axe. Golden Axe. Golden Axe. Golden Axe. One... First player use WASD. Great
[1461.00s -> 1469.62s]  job. Here are a few things. Important. Entering one. Command prompt. Faded color password controls.
[1469.86s -> 1478.15s]  Change the... That's probably why it has 200,000 views and only 400 favorites.
[1478.71s -> 1491.37s]  Okay. Yeah, the numpad doesn't do anything. I pressed every... I pressed every number on my
[1491.37s -> 1497.58s]  whole keyboard. It was archived a month ago. What the hell's going on? Hold on. Let me like... Let
[1497.58s -> 1519.30s]  me refresh the page. Got it. Oh, that looks horrible. What did I press? Please open your
[1519.30s -> 1529.13s]  manual to page four. Find the word in the lower right and type it below. God damn it! What is it?
[1529.13s -> 1545.54s]  Somebody has it down here. Type any word to get through the password request. Seriously? Okay.
[1546.57s -> 1558.39s]  Oh, we're going to do arcade. This looks like when Game Boy decided
[1559.11s -> 1587.83s]  they were going to put color on Game Boy. Okay. Okay. Every button on the keyboard doesn't work.
[1591.32s -> 1604.02s]  Only... How does left and right work but not anything else? What? What are the controls?
[1607.19s -> 1622.22s]  W... Up... W-X-A-D? S is attack. Q diagonal... Q-E-Z-C. Tab... Okay. So it's S. Tab is jump.
[1632.39s -> 1647.18s]  All right, dude. What the fuck is going on here? This one don't work.
[1648.84s -> 1655.72s]  RT Game Crowd just came in with a huge raid right now. What's up, dude? Thanks for the raid!
[1655.72s -> 1661.50s]  Welcome, everybody. We're currently reading the manual. It's an exciting stream here today.
[1661.98s -> 1670.10s]  Reading the manual for how to press enter in a 25-year-old video game. I'm not sure what you're
[1670.10s -> 1681.08s]  up to, but thanks for the raid. Welcome, everybody. Exciting shit today. Okay. Now, can we see some...
[1681.08s -> 1690.01s]  Can we see some fucking pogchamps with the chaplains? First play WASD. Great. Great job.
[1690.01s -> 1700.06s]  All right, but how do I... On the modern keyboard is a... Fuck it. We gotta go... We
[1700.78s -> 1711.77s]  just had a raid coming. We gotta go number munchers right now. Like, I can't fucking stall. Yeah.
[1714.79s -> 1720.33s]  Number munchers. All right. Play number munchers. Hall of Fame. Let's go to options.
[1721.29s -> 1728.82s]  Difficulty level. Third grade. There. It goes up to eighth grade. Wait. Wait. Hold on. How many
[1728.82s -> 1733.46s]  grades are there? Third, third, fourth, fourth, fifth, fifth, sixth, sixth. Oh, advanced and easy.
[1733.46s -> 1744.84s]  All right. Let's do third grade. Set content. Multiply. Multiples. Use... Challenge. Yeah,
[1744.84s -> 1754.39s]  whatever. It doesn't matter. We'll just go with the default. Okay. Erase Hall of Fame. All right.
[1754.39s -> 1761.80s]  We're good. Play number munchers. Do you want instructions? Yeah. Just to give you a quick
[1761.80s -> 1768.54s]  little refresher. Our hero number muncher. Munchies Digits. Munchi... Munchicus Digitus.
[1771.45s -> 1777.69s]  This is Regis, Smarties, Bashfuls, Workers, and Helpers. We have to be careful of these.
[1778.65s -> 1783.77s]  All right. To call timeout and freeze the game, press enter key. Press it again to resume play.
[1784.41s -> 1789.74s]  There. The squares. Okay. Playing number... Use the arrow keys to move them into muncher.
[1790.38s -> 1795.70s]  You must... You could also use... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Spacebar to eat a number. Yep. You may want to
[1795.70s -> 1799.62s]  quit in the middle of a game. If so, pressing the escape key will end the game. Imagine rage
[1799.62s -> 1813.83s]  quitting number munchers. Okay. Let's go. Equality. Two times... What does it want to do? E... What...
[1813.83s -> 1828.01s]  What... Equals one. This one equals one. This one equals one. This is really easy. Which one
[1828.01s -> 1840.58s]  of these equals one? I'm only in the third grade. All right. What am I missing? Equals one. Nine
[1840.58s -> 1850.89s]  divided by nine. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. That's it. That's it. That's it.
[1852.71s -> 1865.91s]  Oh. He's actually struggling. No, I'm not actually struggling. I'm actually just... I win. All right.
[1865.99s -> 1877.50s]  What... What equals two? Two times nothing. Two. One. Two. Two. Two. Two. Got it. Got it.
[1878.14s -> 1889.26s]  One times two is two. Why are you giving me the answer? I should know this. Oh, no. He's eating
[1889.26s -> 1895.35s]  them. All right. Equals two. Equals two. Two divided by one is... That doesn't... That's a... That's a
[1895.35s -> 1900.94s]  .5. That's not even right. Six divided by three. That's gonna be three divided by six. Doesn't make
[1900.94s -> 1909.90s]  any sense. No, that's one. Don't... It's trying to fool me. Four. Eight. Twelve. Six. That's six.
[1910.92s -> 1924.82s]  Three. One plus... There it is. I thought that was a times. Two divided by... Got it. Equals three. Yeah,
[1924.82s -> 1934.84s]  put me in the fucking third grade. I would destroy this. Well, yeah. That's... That's Mr. Albertson.
[1937.32s -> 1954.52s]  See, he stayed back 25 years. He's incredibly disruptive. We're in three minus zero. That's...
[1954.52s -> 1965.80s]  You can't do that. Hey, Teach, you can't do that. Mr. Albertson, please. Just play your video game.
[1965.80s -> 1981.93s]  Oh, a video game? Almost got killed. Almost got killed. All right. I'm gonna go to, like, the eighth
[1981.93s -> 1987.24s]  grade after this and see how it is. Three divided by one. Three minus zero. That's just... Right? I
[1987.24s -> 2000.92s]  thought it was... Why are we talking negative numbers here? What the fuck? Zero minus three is
[2000.92s -> 2027.88s]  negative three. Whatever it is. I don't know. Who cares? Mr. Albertson. Yeah. What is it?
[2028.82s -> 2042.12s]  You can't just open Doritos in class. Why not? Shit, what the fuck you teach? Oh, that's two.
[2047.90s -> 2064.71s]  Four A12. That's four. No, that's two. Damn it. There it is. I did it. What the fuck was that?
[2066.62s -> 2072.15s]  What just happened? Why was that happening? Did I skip the cut scene? No, I didn't.
[2080.73s -> 2086.65s]  I didn't skip the cut scene. Don't eat my shit. Get out of here.
[2093.53s -> 2099.05s]  Uh, this is actually going to get very, very embarrassing in about two more levels or so.
[2101.38s -> 2105.62s]  You're gonna see just how long I've been out of school for. And that's the thing. I know a
[2105.62s -> 2111.30s]  lot of you guys say, how does he fuck this up? I know all this. I have not been in a classroom
[2111.30s -> 2116.58s]  in almost in 20 years. You know what I mean? Like you, you may have been in a classroom like
[2116.58s -> 2124.09s]  yesterday. I haven't been in a classroom in like 15 fucking years. You know, I don't think about
[2124.09s -> 2134.20s]  this shit. I don't think about like what 36 divided by nine is. What do I care? Once we get,
[2134.20s -> 2142.55s]  once we get to the hard ones, I'm going to, it's going to be guessing. Four divided by four is one
[2144.09s -> 2159.83s]  three. No, three, six, nine, 12. There it is. Five. Okay. This five, 10, 20, 20. Okay. 25 is
[2159.83s -> 2164.63s]  the one that's okay. This is going to get ugly. It's going to get actually very ugly. What? Oh,
[2165.27s -> 2167.27s]  I pressed the wrong button. No, I didn't, I wanted to get,
[2170.01s -> 2179.05s]  I didn't make it out of the third grade. You got to,
[2183.00s -> 2194.17s]  no, I don't want that to be listed. No, I don't want to play that again. Let's do this one.
[2195.48s -> 2201.00s]  Okay. We're going to do, we'll do equality again. No, no, no. I know. I want to, I got to go harder.
[2202.02s -> 2219.61s]  Yeah. Hold on options. Difficulty third grade advanced this time. So this is, I'm, I'm sitting
[2219.61s -> 2222.89s]  at like the front of the classroom, paying attention to everything the teacher is doing.
[2223.53s -> 2231.98s]  Let's see what advanced third grade is. I think I could do this. I'm pretty, I think I'll be okay.
[2233.27s -> 2241.11s]  I think so. What's your superpower? I can fly. Cool. That's like a Superman thing. What's your
[2241.11s -> 2250.57s]  superpower? I can manipulate water. Nice. What's your superpower? Advanced third grade. Oh,
[2251.77s -> 2264.17s]  good, good, good, good, good, good. Multiples. Oh no. I don't even know what any of this is.
[2265.50s -> 2269.74s]  Oh, by the way, just to like give you guys some, some lore here. I don't know how to do
[2269.74s -> 2274.46s]  fractions. I pretended to the entire time I was in school, I got almost every math test, like
[2274.46s -> 2280.18s]  an F on every single fractions. I didn't even care to learn it. When there is a recipe that calls
[2280.18s -> 2287.22s]  for like one seventh of something or like two sixth or like tooth. I have no idea. I need a cup
[2287.22s -> 2294.15s]  to tell me. I, I got like zeros on every single test. That was a fraction. I don't even do them.
[2294.15s -> 2303.42s]  I don't even use them. I, I work in whole numbers. Okay. Let's just do multiples,
[2305.03s -> 2308.23s]  multiples of two. Oh, this is the fucking easiest thing you could have done all day.
[2308.23s -> 2318.36s]  Let me time out. That's not two. Oops. It's okay. The controls are a little weird. I
[2319.24s -> 2323.26s]  there's no, I'm not. Why would I do that? Why would I ever hit that number?
[2323.90s -> 2337.91s]  Multiples of three. Oh no, this is going to get so bad. No, I try to hit the 15.
[2340.34s -> 2343.70s]  I got to slow down because if you go too fast, it'll just fuck the whole thing up.
[2353.80s -> 2357.96s]  Multiples of four. This is, and I know some of you, I'm pausing it right now because I know
[2357.96s -> 2361.96s]  there's a shit load of people in this chat right now who are leaning back in their chair
[2361.96s -> 2368.20s]  and they're going fuck. Once you go five or six denominations high on the multiples,
[2368.20s -> 2375.08s]  I don't know what they are. And I know a shit load of you were doing that right now. You know,
[2375.08s -> 2387.32s]  like, oh yeah, I know my multiples like six, six, 12, 18, 24, 32, 38, 40, 41, 42. I know it.
[2387.32s -> 2409.16s]  You can't lie to me. Where are we? Four? Look at all these 20s. Four, eight, 12, 16, 20, four,
[2409.16s -> 2427.58s]  eight, 12, 16, 20, four, eight, 12, 16, 20, four, eight, 12, 16, 20. Get it. I got it. Does this kill
[2427.58s -> 2457.40s]  him? Holy fuck. That's graphic. His bones going through his head. Holy shit. Multiples of two.
[2457.40s -> 2469.27s]  Wait, wait, did I just level up? I leveled up. All right. Well, I want to get another cut scene
[2469.27s -> 2478.22s]  before I stop fifth grade. Oh, no, I'll do eighth grade. I will just to see if I'm even remotely
[2478.22s -> 2483.85s]  capable of doing eighth grade math. I'm app. I'm not. There's no way I am. I already know. I got
[2483.85s -> 2488.17s]  to let I have to like do some breathing exercises like for the next few minutes because I know
[2491.46s -> 2495.38s]  like I'm going to be looking over the chat and I'm going to be fucking like mad that people are
[2495.38s -> 2498.66s]  like making fun of my like sixth grade education. You know what I mean? I'm going to be like,
[2498.66s -> 2501.78s]  I got to be ready for it. I got to be ready because I know I'm not going to do well.
[2502.74s -> 2508.02s]  And I'm going to look over there and it's going to be like, oh, it's so stupid. How is this? No
[2508.02s -> 2512.50s]  way. He's this stupid. I can't. How did he, how does he drive a car? And I'm going to be like,
[2512.50s -> 2537.46s]  fuck, I can't. I'm goddamn it. Shut up. God, why would you be happy to see like the charred
[2537.46s -> 2541.62s]  remains of somebody that exploded? What the fuck is wrong with this person? What's wrong with this
[2541.62s -> 2556.66s]  guy? All right, let's go. Well, it's getting harder. Oh, they've introduced a new enemy type
[2557.38s -> 2570.86s]  four, eight, 12, 16, 20, four, eight, 12, 16, 20. Where is it? Move. Oh shit. I'm, he ate me.
[2570.86s -> 2589.72s]  I did it. Okay. Five. What a classic game by the way. I could sit here for the next six months
[2589.72s -> 2599.83s]  and do this multiples of two. This is actually really, really fucking easy. Like it's very easy.
[2600.63s -> 2610.87s]  Watch out. Wait, wait, they're getting faster though. All right. How does this person die?
[2611.43s -> 2618.12s]  He's going to go check on it and it's going to crush his skull.
[2627.22s -> 2635.94s]  All right. This is easy. Let's, let's, let's go to, let's go to the fifth grade, right?
[2635.94s -> 2641.32s]  We have to do fifth grade or should I stay? Well, I'm going to, I lost. It's fine. This is,
[2641.32s -> 2643.96s]  we're going to go to the fifth grade. We're going to skip a couple of grades. I'm, I'm good enough.
[2643.96s -> 2648.68s]  I know, I know my multiples of three, two and five. We're going to go to the fifth grade. We've
[2648.68s -> 2674.38s]  leveled up difficulty level fifth grade. Easy. Sounds good to me. Okay. How about, uh, equality
[2676.42s -> 2681.13s]  three. All right. This is the third grade. I don't know. This is the fifth grade.
[2685.21s -> 2704.94s]  Not bad. It's not bad. That's four. All right. This is not going as bad as I thought it was
[2704.94s -> 2715.42s]  going to go. I thought this is going to be way, way worse equals. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
[2716.30s -> 2728.14s]  20, five, five, 10. Yep. That's correct. No shit. That was RNG dog shit. Get out of here.
[2737.85s -> 2753.93s]  No, that's not it. That is what four times four is 16,400. Is it? No, it's fit. I don't think
[2753.93s -> 2773.50s]  that's accurate. What are they teaching our children? No, that's 21. You'd love to see that.
[2773.50s -> 2782.73s]  No, don't say it. I'm not even going to do it. That's 10. Thanks for the help. That's not even
[2782.73s -> 2815.40s]  right. Hold on here. 20. That's 24 16. Is that it? No, two, four, six, eight, 10, 12, two, four,
[2815.40s -> 2826.33s]  six, eight, 10, 12, 20. No, what? That wasn't, I didn't even see that. I would have got that
[2826.33s -> 2833.90s]  immediately equals four. No, I thought it was times. Okay. I can't lose in the fucking fifth
[2833.90s -> 2847.03s]  grade on easy. I actually have to be careful now. Seven, six, five, four, three, four, five, two,
[2847.03s -> 2858.23s]  four, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four. Don't go up. He's going to go up. Two, two, two, four,
[2859.88s -> 2867.37s]  eight. There you go. This is what I'm talking about. Eight, 16, 24, 32. Got it. What? No,
[2867.37s -> 2872.25s]  I thought it was five. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.
[2872.25s -> 2900.49s]  Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Dumber than a fifth grader.
[2902.66s -> 2909.35s]  This is 10. It's tricky though. It is. And look, let's give a little bit of credit to the children
[2909.35s -> 2914.79s]  that are doing these math problems. It's hard to do this. It is. Can we give some credit to
[2914.79s -> 2921.53s]  some fourth graders in this chat, please? Dude, I just lived in the wrong, in the wrong time.
[2921.53s -> 2927.29s]  You know what I mean? If I was like back in like the 1400s, we don't, I don't, we don't do math.
[2929.88s -> 2938.57s]  Math didn't exist. What would I have done in like the 1200s? I don't know. I would have been
[2938.57s -> 2950.81s]  like fucking, I would have had a farm or something. I'd be dead. Why would I be dead?
[2951.45s -> 2978.52s]  Plague. You have my, my colitis. Wait a minute. I wouldn't be dead because I have colitis. So I'd
[2978.52s -> 2984.25s]  be dead. You might be. Yeah, but I wouldn't, but I don't have to worry about numbers.
[2985.05s -> 2992.36s]  I would just live my life. There'd be no like iPhones. There'd be no computers.
[2998.84s -> 3003.24s]  You just, you just walked around town and talked to people. That's what you did.
[3005.59s -> 3010.87s]  You just like walked around. I'm really good at that. I would be great back at like the 12,
[3010.87s -> 3024.78s]  1300s. You just walked around. What is 14? NPC. Yes. That's what, that's what people did.
[3025.66s -> 3031.10s]  You worked like on the farm and then you just walked around town or you were like a guard
[3031.10s -> 3039.96s]  or you ran in or something. I would just be guy that sits at table in, in,
[3039.96s -> 3056.89s]  they needed tons of those people. What are we doing? 14. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I know
[3056.89s -> 3066.34s]  these ones. I don't, I don't know these ones. Is this it? It's 14 right there. 28. No, that's not
[3066.34s -> 3074.10s]  correct. 10, eight, 12, eight, 16, 24, 30. No, that's not even close. Seven, eight, nine, 10,
[3074.10s -> 3084.01s]  11, 12. That's 12. Six, 12, 18, 14. What is this one? Is this it? No. Five, 10, 15, 20, 20, 30,
[3084.01s -> 3090.25s]  30, 40, 40, 50, 50, 60, 70. You all had to do that. Once you get past 60, I don't, I will not hear
[3090.25s -> 3097.58s]  this bullshit that you guys can do that like over fucking like 70 or 80 decimals. Oops.
[3098.30s -> 3114.81s]  What's the last one? That's 16, 28 and two. Yeah, that's correct. 60, eight, six and 84.
[3115.61s -> 3130.01s]  Nobody can do that in their head. Six, 12, 18, six, 12, eight, 24, 32, 32, 10. That's not that hard.
[3131.27s -> 3133.91s]  Yeah, because you were just in math class like fucking four hours ago.
[3143.14s -> 3152.12s]  Fuck. I didn't even press that. You know the last time I was in math class?
[3153.08s -> 3166.97s]  2000. The year 2000 was the last time I saw numbers situated like this. I got, I got a farm to take
[3166.97s -> 3184.81s]  care of. I don't know if I, why do I need to know what equals 14? We're good. 14 rows of corn. I
[3184.81s -> 3190.81s]  don't count. I just dump all the seeds in there and wait six months and then pull them out of the
[3190.81s -> 3210.52s]  ground. Oh no, this is, it's over. Once we go higher than like 13, 14, 15, 16 is when, no way.
[3210.52s -> 3217.30s]  There's no way I'm going to do this. Okay, get the easy ones. I have no lives left either.
[3226.25s -> 3240.78s]  That's it. Hey guys, I, you know, that's like funny, I guess in a way. It's a kind of funny,
[3241.34s -> 3247.18s]  but like him pretending to not know how to do like fifth grade, like multiplying and stuff,
[3247.18s -> 3251.86s]  like that's, he's better than that, isn't he? Like, I don't know. I just feel like I'm,
[3252.74s -> 3264.12s]  like I caught the stream for like 10 minutes and I just like, he's, he's just doing this like I'm
[3264.12s -> 3273.43s]  fucking stupid act thing where I can't do fifth grade math. Has he really gotten that low in
[3273.43s -> 3285.45s]  regards to what he's pretending he can't do? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have world hunger to solve
[3287.30s -> 3294.82s]  and I have a line of microscopes I have to look into to see, to see how many fucking
[3294.82s -> 3298.66s]  microorganisms are inside of my piece of bread that I do every day.
[3299.40s -> 3317.90s]  I'm like a bread microscopic person. Yeah, I'm pretty smart. I don't know. Why would you ever
[3317.90s -> 3324.06s]  do that? You're like weird. You're fucking weird if you do that. Why would you put bread under a
[3324.06s -> 3327.82s]  microscope all the time? What's, why are you doing that? Stop doing that if you do.
[3335.80s -> 3340.76s]  No, it did clicked. It clicked. It clicked on it. Wait, that's correct. No, it's not.
[3353.99s -> 3363.46s]  Okay, six. All right, I gotta get out of this game. I gotta get out of this game before
[3363.46s -> 3380.58s]  people really start to become concerned. All right, all right, just, just lose, just lose,
[3380.58s -> 3385.56s]  just lose, just lose. I want to see, I want to see what the eighth grade looks like. Eighth
[3385.56s -> 3388.86s]  grade advanced. Let's see if I can get one question right and then we can move on.
[3391.24s -> 3407.21s]  Eighth grade and above. I wonder if I can get one question correct. Okay, primes, equality,
[3407.21s -> 3429.46s]  factors. Factors of 66. What? That's okay. I can do this one. Oh, that's not a factor.
[3434.94s -> 3447.24s]  Is 10 a factor of 66? Nope. Eight? One? Eleven, right? Yeah. It's just what, it's just what can
[3447.24s -> 3461.43s]  make 66 eventually. This is how that works. Is it eight or is it 26? 26, 46? I'm not just
[3461.43s -> 3493.75s]  guessing. Factors of 51. Okay, yeah. 51. Yeah, just one and 51. That's what I was thinking.
[3494.55s -> 3511.22s]  It's a lot more than that though. Seven? Seventeen? Doesn't know pee pants.
[3512.98s -> 3518.95s]  No, and, and I, I don't even care. I, you know, like some people would probably get really upset
[3518.95s -> 3526.39s]  about this. Factors of, like, oh, sorry. Sorry, scientists in the chat. I don't know what every
[3526.39s -> 3534.15s]  factor of 29 is. That's the thing that you say that you know and somebody goes, all right.
[3534.15s -> 3542.49s]  Anyways, so about the other reports that you owe tomorrow. Does that mean there's only two?
[3546.84s -> 3559.48s]  No, there's not. Any scientists in the chat? Hey, go ahead, go examine some bread while you're at it.
[3559.48s -> 3578.84s]  Check it for E. coli or whatever you're doing. Is there only two? Oh, it's a barbecue. We're eating
[3578.84s -> 3597.54s]  numbers. Um, that's incredibly dangerous. I could, I could have gotten hurt there. Factors of 67.
[3607.54s -> 3616.25s]  I know every factor of 67. Okay, cool. You're ruining our cruise. Can we just enjoy ourselves,
[3616.25s -> 3641.78s]  please? Um, 13? No. Two? Four? Who said four? You said four. You said four. I looked, somebody said
[3641.78s -> 3648.22s]  four. Some of you. I saw somebody said four. I'll, I'll, I got them. Yes, they did. Yes, they did.
[3648.22s -> 3662.65s]  Yes, they did. Yes, they did. Somebody said four. At least two people said four. I don't know what
[3662.65s -> 3675.72s]  a prime number is. Well, it was going to be, it's any number that can be like divided by itself,
[3675.72s -> 3680.92s]  right? Something like that. That can go into itself. Divided by, multiplied by itself. It's
[3681.00s -> 3685.32s]  something like that. I don't know. I don't know. Why, why do I need to know what a prime number is?
[3687.37s -> 3695.86s]  It doesn't even, that doesn't matter. Oh, cut, cut the camera to like a close-up of my mother's face
[3695.86s -> 3704.66s]  crying. He was supposed to be an accountant. He was supposed to know. I want him to, I want him to
[3704.66s -> 3733.99s]  know his number. He's mad. I'm not mad. Hey, don't, don't get mad. Get even. Eleven's not a prime
[3733.99s -> 3738.71s]  number of 91. No, this is, wait, this is not prime numbers anymore. This is not prime numbers
[3738.71s -> 3744.49s]  anymore. This is, this is, this is different. This is different. Oh shit. I thought, I didn't
[3744.49s -> 3752.52s]  know we were on a different thing. All right. Last try. Last try. Last try. Then I'm done. For
[3752.52s -> 3762.26s]  real. I swear to God. Eight. Okay. Prime numbers. It's two. The only reason why I know this is
[3762.26s -> 3765.62s]  because this is how many days it takes for that package to get there that you order from prime.
[3766.26s -> 3787.22s]  That's the only reason why I know that. Greater than 19. Because I said the word Amazon. What?
[3788.10s -> 3809.90s]  Amazon joke. Minus two. What? Because it said Amazon prime. Was that too easy? But if, but if,
[3809.90s -> 3829.94s]  but if I say, why don't you go ahead and sub with your Twitch Prime? But that's funny. Let's play
[3829.94s -> 3844.39s]  Star Wars. It would if you said it unironically. That's all right. I know that we're all on the
[3844.39s -> 3852.60s]  same page with our math abilities, so it don't matter. Now this is F1 to toggle mouse keyboard.
[3852.60s -> 3868.38s]  Let's do, I guess. Is this a flying game? Princess Leia's rebel force. Select a death star.
[3868.38s -> 3892.58s]  Fire laser at desired death star. What? Okay. Uh, mouse control. Good.
[3895.64s -> 3912.58s]  How many death stars do they have? Shoot the fighters. Shoot fireballs. Shoot,
[3913.46s -> 3928.34s]  shoot the death star. Did I get it? This is actually pretty good for a game that came out
[3929.30s -> 3954.31s]  in like 1983. Don't I shoot it inside of the hole? Where's the hole? Exha- Did I get it?
[3954.31s -> 3971.32s]  Exhaust port. What am I, what's shooting at me? I think I just have to dodge, right?
[3978.95s -> 3995.91s]  Shoot the- Got it. Death star destroyed. All right, this one I'm, I don't want to click this one yet
[3995.91s -> 4000.63s]  because it's probably gonna, I'm gonna get stuck here for a long time. So we're gonna play this one.
[4000.63s -> 4015.05s]  This one's called the Elf's Christmas. This is called the Elf's Christmas Adventure or Go-
[4042.10s -> 4042.50s]  Measures.
[4074.81s -> 4080.01s]  Confused. If you give it a word that it doesn't understand, it will tell you what word it doesn't
[4080.01s -> 4084.41s]  know. Try entering your command again using a different word in place of the one the game
[4084.41s -> 4092.09s]  you're objected to. Your commands should generally be in the format verb, the multiple noun phrase,
[4092.09s -> 4100.33s]  preposition noun phrase object, some hypothetical examples of valid commands. Place a red rock
[4100.41s -> 4105.83s]  in the small bowl. Put the green rock and the small pebble behind the oak tree.
[4106.63s -> 4112.63s]  Read my poetry book. Swim in the swimming pool. Examine the golden ring. Attack him.
[4114.14s -> 4126.60s]  Get all. Examine the keys. Push the button. Okay. Why is there attack him? All right,
[4126.60s -> 4132.04s]  turn the doorknob, then enter the cave. So you do like then and and and the- Okay, I get it.
[4132.68s -> 4139.38s]  So you can type help. Gives you a hint and then inventory will display a list of the items you're
[4139.38s -> 4146.54s]  currently carrying. Okay. Holy shit. This is elaborate. Save. Oops. Will allow you to edit
[4148.17s -> 4159.22s]  your previous input command. List exits. Look. Verbose. Causes output to go to both the screen
[4159.22s -> 4173.59s]  and a printer. The alt key and the up arrow causes a north command. Oh my god. I thought this was
[4173.59s -> 4184.57s]  going to be just a short little fun Christmas game. This is Dungeons and Dragons rules. Do not.
[4185.29s -> 4198.82s]  Oh. Do not what? I did it. Octagonal room. Remember that you can turn the sound on and
[4198.82s -> 4206.73s]  off by giving the command sound on and sound off respectively. All right. This is what I have.
[4206.73s -> 4219.37s]  This is what I'm listening to right now. Hold on a second. I need to like do this.
[4220.17s -> 4237.74s]  Let me put on like actual Christmas music. Okay. You are in an octagonal room filled with
[4237.74s -> 4242.46s]  hundreds of elves. Each of the elves is identical and all seem to move in unison.
[4243.26s -> 4249.19s]  You stare at the elf directly in front of you. He stares back. You feel an itching in your nose
[4249.19s -> 4256.95s]  which builds and builds until- Achoo! The entire room of elves sneezes simultaneously. Why?
[4257.67s -> 4272.90s]  Why would you? What now? The entire room of elves echoes your sneeze. Achoo! Sneeze again.
[4274.23s -> 4281.16s]  Sneeze again. Such behavior would be most unbecoming of a Christmas elf.
[4284.47s -> 4297.78s]  Cough. I don't understand cough as a verb. How about um get up? Um look. There's barely enough
[4297.78s -> 4301.54s]  room to turn around here. If there was anything to find here you'd surely be standing on it.
[4302.50s -> 4314.34s]  Octagonal room. There's an elf directly in front of me. Talk. Talk to elf. Sorry but you don't have
[4314.34s -> 4318.58s]  time to mess around with the elf. You have a very important mission to help Santa save Christmas
[4318.58s -> 4325.98s]  this year. Please try to devote your energies and your mind to the task at hand. Octagon. Okay.
[4328.07s -> 4349.48s]  Feel. Eat elf. Eat the elf? You must be kidding. Uh such behavior would be unbecoming of a Christmas
[4349.48s -> 4377.86s]  elf. Walk. Leave. Exiting doesn't seem appropriate right now. Damn being an elf sucks. Right. You
[4377.86s -> 4385.98s]  yell. Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Your voice echoes loudly through the area and the volume of
[4385.98s -> 4392.22s]  your shriek causes the very ground to vibrate. You feel much better having let out some steam.
[4393.18s -> 4406.38s]  But nothing has changed. You can't talk or leave. So what inventory? You aren't carrying anything.
[4407.40s -> 4424.57s]  Grab toy. Grab desk. Work. Make toy. You don't have time to be messing around. So what the what am I
[4424.57s -> 4446.55s]  supposed to do? That's right. You're here to help Santa. What a smart elf. I think it is work.
[4458.28s -> 4466.82s]  Everybody sneezes at the same time. That probably means something. Look down. I don't understand as
[4466.82s -> 4485.66s]  the object. Look up. Look at elf. He sneezes as you look at him. What is going on? What's his
[4485.66s -> 4504.76s]  sneeze back? Um is this how we communicate? Stand. Stand up. Stand. Grab tissue. All right I'm
[4505.40s -> 4512.54s]  10 seconds. Look at floor. You see nothing unusual. Look at elf. He sneezes at you. Look
[4513.18s -> 4523.77s]  at chair. What chair? There's no chair. We're standing? Look at ceiling. Look at desk.
[4524.41s -> 4537.90s]  There's no desk. What? We're just all standing in a room? Go to Santa. What Santa? There is no
[4537.90s -> 4568.84s]  Santa here. Look at mirrors. How do I have minus 50 points? Hint. Walk east.
[4587.22s -> 4595.69s]  Look west. Look in room. What room? There's no room. Where are we standing?
[4598.17s -> 4618.04s]  Are we outside? Look outside. Make toys. You don't have time to do that. You have very important
[4618.04s -> 4635.38s]  mission to help Santa save Christmas. Look at ground. If there's anything to find here,
[4635.38s -> 4657.10s]  you'd be standing on it. Where is Santa? Look at shoes. Mirror room. The elves are just you.
[4660.66s -> 4675.32s]  Move feet. You're in a mirror box. Yeah. What? No that's not what that is.
[4681.98s -> 4690.58s]  Okay I'm fucking out of here. Next. Next. Okay we've got what's up here?
[4695.43s -> 4705.70s]  Uh we have why do I have two SimCities? Which one is better? SimCity and then SimCity Classic.
[4710.50s -> 4718.14s]  Just play it twice. Which one's better? Just play them both and see which ones. Just do like a
[4718.14s -> 4737.29s]  review. All right we're doing we'll do SimCity Classic. Start new city. Uh I don't I don't I
[4737.29s -> 4746.55s]  never played SimCity. Medium? Medium. I have no idea what any of this is. This is such a mistake.
[4747.27s -> 4756.04s]  This is a mistake. I have no idea what any of these buttons do. Okay city. I don't even know
[4756.04s -> 4765.29s]  where we are. Okay so this is a zoom in. I'm assuming I gotta make roads. What does this do?
[4766.70s -> 4772.22s]  Bonds. Ten thousand dollars. More residential domes needed. Power grid city form. Okay who are we?
[4772.22s -> 4797.30s]  Residential. Can't build on that dust pool. Residential. That needs power. Does that work?
[4797.30s -> 4818.30s]  Does that work? Does that do it? Thank you Red Lemonade for the ten community subs. Thank you
[4818.30s -> 4837.26s]  Red Lemonade. I've never played SimCity. You this is a mistake. So how do I make a power plant?
[4839.30s -> 4848.65s]  Nuclear gravity? A nuclear plant? This is an old version. Yeah it is. Do I have to connect
[4848.65s -> 4863.10s]  the nuclear power over here or something? Does that oh is this turned on? I think I got it.
[4863.90s -> 4872.09s]  So you have to all right. What's going on here? What are these little dots mean?
[4872.73s -> 4885.83s]  Wait we need roads. All right hold on. What's going on? Well these people can't ever leave.
[4886.47s -> 4896.94s]  Okay hold on. What's going on? Why is this happening to my houses?
[4897.66s -> 4917.54s]  Fuck the roads they're overrated. Okay so I have your graphics card is dying. More houses?
[4918.26s -> 4933.45s]  I need to move this around. All right this is my city. Let's go this way. Commercial. So this is
[4933.45s -> 4952.39s]  where everyone will work. Shit near the power plant. Power plant. We'll do uh nuclear. Tax rate.
[4953.19s -> 4967.50s]  Seven percent. Whoa whoa whoa whoa what's this tax rate? No no no it's zero. Twelve percent.
[4967.50s -> 4977.83s]  Go with these figures. How do I get them to go from here to there?
[4977.83s -> 5000.55s]  Insane. You're insane. You're insane. Twelve percent is high? Twelve percent? What? Twelve
[5000.55s -> 5029.06s]  percent is a high is high tax rate? Am I doing this right? Kind of. Twelve percent's a high tax
[5029.06s -> 5049.10s]  rate. He doesn't know. What what do you mean? What do I not know? It's five percent in Massachusetts.

[5234.62s -> 5249.99s]  Traffic density. There's no cars. People are just committing crimes. Is that why there's just trash
[5249.99s -> 5259.11s]  everywhere? Oh is this just like a complete anarchy? So much crime at the power plant.

[6126.28s -> 6136.07s]  Time to get addicted. Oh shit my volume has been down this whole time. They may have been sounds
[6136.07s -> 6146.26s]  in that game. I have no idea. Miner is a game of rare earths mining. You mine platinum, gold, silver.
[6146.26s -> 6151.78s]  You may have your minerals assayed at the bank. Watch your health. Make frequent stops at the
[6151.78s -> 6161.99s]  hospital. Arrow keys. Move miner in four directions. T B that's elevator up to the top and elevator
[6161.99s -> 6172.50s]  down. H is help. Remember that. X is exit. Don't touch it. Q is quiet. S R pump water. You need at
[6172.50s -> 6177.22s]  least a bucket. Drill granite. You need at least a drill. Enter. Need used to enter buildings.

[6250.84s -> 6257.96s]  He died with his tool in his hand. For the love of sweet Miss Mimi. His bank account was $1130.
[6264.14s -> 6279.82s]  Imagine setting your bank account on your gravestone. That would be really fucked up. Okay,
[6279.82s -> 6294.25s]  I want to try that again. I want to try again. This is fun. VGA miner. All right pump water.
[6295.05s -> 6303.82s]  Pump water. This time if I find water don't stand in it. What's in here? Welcome. You can't fly dummy.
[6304.76s -> 6317.64s]  Try the elevator. All right let's go. We're gonna go down here. Granite's too hard to dig. Okay,
[6317.64s -> 6332.31s]  got some silver. The mine is caving in on you. You lost some silver. Oh fuck off. Sandstone. Easy
[6332.31s -> 6346.17s]  digging. Dumbass trying to dig granite. All right I haven't found anything. Okay this silver.

[6368.31s -> 6382.49s]  the elevator. Is the bank? Oh there's like a hospital over here too. All right go in the bank.
[6384.60s -> 6393.24s]  You can't fly. How do you go in a building? E? Enter. Okay E. Welcome to the community bank.
[6393.24s -> 6398.68s]  We're pleased to assay for you. Our rates are not only competitive. They're the only ones in town.
[6399.24s -> 6409.24s]  Press X to leave the bank. Okay so I have today's quotes. Silver 15.4. What do I have? AG. AG is
[6409.24s -> 6417.93s]  silver right? Okay let's get some silver. Cash in all your minerals. A. Well that's a net loss.
[6425.19s -> 6438.52s]  Okay cool. How do I leave? How do I get out of here? Exit. B. You lost money.
[6438.68s -> 6453.24s]  Yeah I gotta find gold or platinum. Isn't X quit to DOS? No that's not okay. So digging costs money
[6453.24s -> 6461.26s]  and I don't have any this is I'm just operating at a horrible loss. Here be dragons. Here be dragons.
[6461.26s -> 6489.74s]  Here be dragons. Oh shit. What the fuck? Give me some platinum. It costs. It costs $20 to dig

[7094.73s -> 7111.40s]  the direction. Oh okay P. Oh it just gets rid of the water. I get it. So what does the corkscrew do?
[7117.40s -> 7130.38s]  Pump drill granite. All right so it's D. D. Oh that's cost. Look at how much money that costs.
[7134.26s -> 7144.87s]  That's $200 to do that. That's not worth doing. At all. That's not worth it. Why would I even use
[7144.87s -> 7172.10s]  that? It's 200 per drill. That's horrible. All right let's do some water here. What? What happened?
[7172.10s -> 7185.13s]  What? What happened? What happened? What? Wait it's a hundred and it was a hundred and fifty dollars?
[7185.13s -> 7193.88s]  A pump? It costs money to use the bucket. To put your hands in water and throw what?
[7199.90s -> 7216.60s]  I. Oh god damn it. I'm so sad. Okay we're gonna play Dune 2 and then we're gonna open it up to the
[7216.60s -> 7230.12s]  to the people to vote here in a minute. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh.
[7234.30s -> 7247.21s]  We're good. And urgent games. This is Dune. D. U. N. E. Dune 2. Not doom 2. A lot of people just
[7247.21s -> 7278.68s]  went oh come on. I thought you were playing doom. What about it? He didn't read the book? No.
[7279.40s -> 7293.02s]  I didn't read the book. Is this the one with the big worms in the ground? No that's Tremors.
[7305.54s -> 7306.82s]  Is this how the book goes?
[7306.82s -> 7317.93s]  The house that produces the most spies. Set territories and no rules of engagement.
[7318.89s -> 7323.53s]  So it's the purge. Only you have to bring like cumin.
[7345.34s -> 7350.38s]  Those alive? That seems very impractical for a plane to do that. I've never seen this movie.
[7350.38s -> 7358.73s]  There's a seagull plane.
[7368.14s -> 7373.54s]  There is no movie. There's not this is a movie right?
[7376.10s -> 7379.46s]  Is it only a book? There are like yeah there's like three movies.
[7384.06s -> 7390.34s]  There's no movie. All right is this a click and point adventure game? Is this a shooter game?
[7390.58s -> 7410.01s]  What is this? Battle for Arrakis. Play a game. Select your house. All right we've got Gryffindor,
[7410.01s -> 7425.40s]  Slytherin, and the ram. I'm gonna be well isn't the way this works. If you say that you're
[7425.40s -> 7431.00s]  Slytherin you're actually Hufflepuff. And if you say that you're Gryffindor it means you're
[7431.00s -> 7438.70s]  actually Ravenclaw. That's how that works right? And if you say that you're Hufflepuff
[7438.86s -> 7449.30s]  you're actually Slytherin. This is the cool one to say that you are. I'm Slytherin. I don't play by
[7449.30s -> 7476.17s]  any fucking rules. Yes you do. I can't select? Let's go. All right where do we land? Home planet
[7476.17s -> 7486.55s]  of the Atreides has a warm calm climate and the lands are lush and green. Okay what about it? That
[7486.55s -> 7494.49s]  defines spices? The rich soils and mild weather supports an extensive variety of agricultural
[7494.49s -> 7500.38s]  activities. In recent centuries industrial and technological development has added to the
[7500.38s -> 7508.46s]  prosperity of the Caladanian people. Do you wish to join house Atreides? Not yet no no not yet.
[7509.34s -> 7517.64s]  I want to see the other intro. House Ordos. The home plant it's like icy and cool looking. The
[7517.64s -> 7522.76s]  home planet of Ordos is a frigid and ice covered world. We presume the Ordos import their agricultural
[7522.76s -> 7529.29s]  and technological goods from nearby star systems. Acting as traders and brokers the Ordos
[7529.29s -> 7534.57s]  produce no physical products of their own and rely upon their merchandising skills to survive.
[7535.77s -> 7539.85s]  That sounds pretty interesting. I might be as I might be an Ordos. All right what about the
[7539.85s -> 7549.66s]  Harkonnen? This is a big fireball. From the dark world of Ghedi Prime the savage house Harkonnen
[7549.66s -> 7555.18s]  has spread across the universe. Accrual people. The Harkonnen are ruthless towards both friend and
[7555.18s -> 7575.00s]  foe in their fanatical pursuit of power. I am Mentat Radnor. With my guidance you may be able
[7575.00s -> 7585.61s]  to assist us in conquering this dusty little planet. Okay for your first test you will be
[7585.61s -> 7593.13s]  expected to produce 1 000 credits and not a granular less. You may earn credits by harvesting
[7593.13s -> 7599.45s]  spice and will need to build a refinery to convert spice to credits. Okay harvest spice,
[7599.53s -> 7605.05s]  refinery convert spice. If any of our foolish enemies attempt to attack your base you will
[7605.05s -> 7615.78s]  have the pleasure of seeing the invincible Harkonnen troops in action. Oh it's an RTS.
[7618.65s -> 7628.90s]  Okay uh construction yard is that there? Build this. Build it. Mentat. Oh I have to add okay.
[7631.16s -> 7642.09s]  Small construction slab. Wind trap power center. There isn't enough open concrete to place the
[7642.09s -> 7645.29s]  structure. You may proceed but without enough concrete the building will need repairs.
[7646.01s -> 7657.27s]  No don't do that. Do I already have a construction yard? Um can I select a unit? There we go.
[7657.99s -> 7672.23s]  Okay move. Acknowledge. Go look over this way. This map is tiny. Okay build construction facilities.
[7672.23s -> 7677.51s]  All structures are built by the construction facility. Got it. All right let's do. No no no
[7677.67s -> 7691.98s]  I didn't want to do that. Oh shit. All right I want a slab. Small concrete slab.
[7694.38s -> 7703.40s]  Place the slab over here. Where should I put this? Cannot place the foundation here.
[7704.20s -> 7707.40s]  Concrete. Use concrete to make a sturdy foundation for your structures.
[7716.30s -> 7737.69s]  Where? This is one person? All right all right all right all right all right uh just
[7739.00s -> 7747.27s]  get over there. Construction yard. Okay so now I can do a power center. It takes all right.
[7747.27s -> 7750.55s]  No no no I get it. I get it. Stop stop stop. I gotta build four of these don't I?
[7751.91s -> 7768.54s]  I have to go like it has to sit on a slab right? All the zooms and chat hating this game.
[7771.72s -> 7780.73s]  Oh I see. He's getting it. He's getting it. He's so stupid. He's so stupid. He's so stupid.
[7794.07s -> 7796.79s]  I need a thousand credits right? You have to start harvesting stuff.
[7797.27s -> 7805.50s]  Oh stupid idiot. Dumb fucking idiot. Stupid fucking idiot.
[7812.30s -> 7816.71s]  The wind trap supplies power to your base without power your structures will decay.
[7817.59s -> 7826.79s]  My power info needed output is 100. All right why don't you go like over here?
[7831.85s -> 7839.78s]  Start like exploring. We need to find resources. Yes sir. You go up here.
[7840.18s -> 7851.96s]  All right I need to how do I? Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.
[7851.96s -> 7860.04s]  Shit. Shit. Shit. Attack. Attack. Attack. No don't shoot your own guy over here.
[7864.01s -> 7877.08s]  Get him. All right what do I get? Oh I got a new pink spice refinery. All right wait wait wait wait.
[7878.65s -> 7895.96s]  Slabs. Oh shit. Look at these fucking actions for a minute.
[7899.75s -> 7919.90s]  Seven. Can't place the foundation. Why? Good good good good. This is actually kind of fun.
[7922.90s -> 7928.09s]  I would love to play this online versus like six people. Try pressing M for move.
[7932.33s -> 7938.58s]  Well that's good. A for attack I'm assuming too. All right what do I need? I need like three. Six
[7938.58s -> 7957.03s]  right? That's six. All right keep on building this shit. The PSX version is cleaner. Yeah this is
[7957.03s -> 7975.16s]  this is old old old old old old. Very old. We got hotkeys boys. This is real RTS.
[7976.76s -> 7986.74s]  All right let's get the spice refinery on there. They improved a lot with red alert.
[7986.74s -> 7995.56s]  Yeah. You can feel the red alert. You can feel the command and conquer in this.
[7998.10s -> 8004.20s]  That like affirmative affirmative. I think it's the same voice just with a higher bit rate.
[8005.08s -> 8019.24s]  Come on hurry up hurry up hurry up. Red alert could be the best RTS I've ever played. It was such a
[8019.24s -> 8027.48s]  mess. I loved it. I might play that one day. That game is a fucking mess. It's crazy how nuts that
[8027.48s -> 8036.34s]  game can get. Convert spice into credits. What's that? Oh okay. All right we go. We're getting
[8036.34s -> 8045.69s]  spices going. Search for spice fields to harvest. All right what does the spice field look like?
[8046.41s -> 8053.35s]  All right move. Uh we need to find spice field. Damn I want to play red alert like right now.
[8054.92s -> 8060.68s]  It's like riding a bike too. I remember everything. I remember everything. Having like 10 construction
[8060.68s -> 8066.84s]  yards. Like 20 tonyas. Like a hundred power plants. I remember building power plants into
[8066.84s -> 8072.84s]  other people's bases to just put tesla coils all over this inside their fucking base. I'm playing
[8072.84s -> 8088.12s]  that like soon. Like real soon. That just scratched the itch in my brain. I can't wait to play that.
[8088.12s -> 8096.10s]  Do it now? No no no no. Can't do it now. Can't do it now. Oh I'm gonna though and it's gonna be
[8096.18s -> 8101.14s]  fucking awesome. You have no idea how much fun. I can't wait. I'm gonna be I'm gonna like destroy
[8101.14s -> 8112.04s]  that whole game. Acknowledge. We're doing it tomorrow. We're doing that tomorrow. I'm gonna
[8112.04s -> 8114.60s]  I'm gonna find a way to get it to work. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna buy it. I'm gonna get it. I'm
[8114.60s -> 8117.96s]  we're doing it tomorrow. That's what we're doing. I'm just gonna play fucking red alert all day.
[8117.96s -> 8131.18s]  I can't wait. It's gonna be incredible. Yeah I'm gonna have like like 50 mammoth tanks and shit.
[8131.18s -> 8136.14s]  Like all going in different directions. I I love that game. I'm so happy that I ended up playing
[8136.14s -> 8146.98s]  this because it reminded me of how just dumb fun that game is. Is multiplayer still working
[8146.98s -> 8154.60s]  that game? Does it? Anybody have any any idea? There's no way it does. Not even close. No way.
[8154.60s -> 8167.38s]  You have to do a lot of specific things. The original version doesn't work anymore.
[8167.38s -> 8171.86s]  I'm gonna do some research and figure this out because if we could like get like a
[8171.86s -> 8182.44s]  how many people could play in it? There's open red alert. All right this is not a virus.
[8182.44s -> 8188.28s]  They're effective. Oh I can't wait. I love that game so fucking much. I'm so excited.
[8188.28s -> 8197.13s]  You have no idea. I'm so excited. My whole teenage life has been building up to this
[8197.13s -> 8209.13s]  moment tomorrow. I return. I'm gonna have an impenetrable fort. I'm gonna be unstoppable.
[8211.16s -> 8215.48s]  The turrets. The little caps. Remember those things? The little like tuna cans
[8215.48s -> 8227.53s]  that like oh dude I love it can't wait the origin version works on windows 10
[8233.66s -> 8240.31s]  why aren't why aren't games as cool nowadays they are they are they are I mean I I would agree with

[21704.86s -> 21715.46s]  this it's just that kind of came out of nowhere from a video i mean like six years ago seven
[21715.46s -> 21729.59s]  years ago all right i need to get this i need to move this power lift power lift i can't get it
[21730.23s -> 21747.88s]  all right where we going oh i see where i have not explored that way what are you doing giant
[21747.88s -> 21755.16s]  enemy spider and i i do like a pokemon right i'm getting this right aren't i
[21767.53s -> 21803.99s]  open oh you're dumb where am i not going this way i have no idea
[21805.11s -> 21817.08s]  play the rest of the game like this um i don't think i can yes i can uh where do i need to go
[21818.04s -> 21851.10s]  oh shit i found it got it sword okay i have to turn the stream off like i have to get out of here
[21851.10s -> 21861.66s]  i have to turn the stream do you know why i have to turn the stream off somebody why why don't turn
[21861.66s -> 21880.74s]  the stream off for what because i have to i have to go and get uh red alert ready i can't wait
[21883.21s -> 21898.20s]  oh i'm gonna do a bunch of research this is not even the right way to go use the wall the wall
[21899.72s -> 21919.37s]  the wall wait what uh okay is this it's the that's the power lift you don't even turn it on it's
[21919.37s -> 21931.59s]  already on i figured out why i don't like these things because this is what a monster looks like
[21931.59s -> 21937.51s]  in your dream this is a nightmare monster you know when you have a dream about something
[21937.51s -> 21943.53s]  that that's not scary at all but it is because it's real in your dream this is what they look
[21943.53s -> 21960.90s]  like and it even looks like this in your dreams too well pixelated and strange and just doesn't
[21960.90s -> 21967.78s]  make any sense i've actually seen these green things probably in a nightmare before and they're
[21967.78s -> 21972.66s]  just so fucking weird and it doesn't make any sense and they're not scary but they're real
[21973.62s -> 21988.20s]  i don't like it yeah because you don't get a gun in your dream you you get like a dull pair
[21988.20s -> 22012.62s]  of scissors that you drop five times and you can't punch no it sucks all right what this is a secret
[22012.62s -> 22025.96s]  door what is this you guys have had the dream where somebody's outside your house and you know
[22025.96s -> 22033.54s]  they're going to come in and you know that the door is open or unlocked and you are rushing to
[22033.54s -> 22042.04s]  try to lock the door and you know that they're almost at the door and you have to close the door
[22042.04s -> 22048.50s]  not only does door have to close but lock too because they can just open it that's the worst
[22048.50s -> 22052.26s]  thing in the world so one of the worst feelings you're gonna have in a dream is here comes these
[22052.26s -> 22054.82s]  guys they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna come in and they're gonna kill me they're coming
[22054.82s -> 22059.69s]  in to kill me or do something terrible i gotta close the door i have to lock the door and you
[22059.69s -> 22065.64s]  get there and they're there and you don't turn the little thing or this also happens in your
[22065.64s -> 22070.89s]  dream your lock sucks and it doesn't hold them at all they just kind of put a shoulder into it
[22070.89s -> 22083.59s]  and it just opens you have this little baby lock oh that's the worst i can actually keep going
[22087.86s -> 22092.42s]  i didn't think i was going to end this stream getting lost in checks quest but it happened
[22101.30s -> 22104.02s]  yeah i hate dropping shit in streams this is the most annoying thing in the world
[22107.66s -> 22112.94s]  i wouldn't drop that that many times i would not fumble around that many times trying to like run
[22112.94s -> 22126.76s]  away your brain just can't do anything my blue door i've told you this before
[22128.26s -> 22133.77s]  but it is worth mentioning again another strange thing about dreams especially dreams that i have
[22133.77s -> 22138.01s]  sometimes is there'll be somebody in my dream that's supposed to be directly related to me
[22138.01s -> 22145.27s]  or a close friend of mine and it's not even them i'll be walking around in my in my house or
[22145.27s -> 22152.94s]  something and my dad will be walking around and it's like oh that's dad no it's my dad doesn't
[22152.94s -> 22161.30s]  have a mustache and black hair and that doesn't look anything like my dad but that's dad why is
[22161.30s -> 22177.51s]  that like that's just dead no it's not real dad and then you start thinking about like what are
[22177.51s -> 22182.87s]  dreams and am i like in somebody else's reality is this like a different life that i was in
[22184.14s -> 22196.95s]  and then you wake up and you go i gotta call dad it's past memories it's my past emotions coming
[22197.91s -> 22210.95s]  when i lived 400 years ago my father had a mustache i don't know where the fuck i'm going
[22210.95s -> 22230.26s]  i think i've had about enough of uh of doom checks i think i've had about enough there's a door over
[22230.26s -> 22249.27s]  here that i can't open well what what is it why is this listed here as a door see you're in my
[22249.27s -> 22252.95s]  dream yeah but how many times have you guys had a dream about me and i have a mustache and like

[22830.49s -> 22835.93s]  that your rant about ghosts and family members watching us from the afterlife was almost a
[22835.93s -> 22840.89s]  straight-up rip of george carlin's material i loved it and i think it is further proof that

[23570.06s -> 23576.14s]  that on christmas day is just like a 40 to 50 second video that repeats talking about how i'm
[23576.14s -> 23581.82s]  not here today and it's like a weird little ad like merry christmas i'll see you next week i'm
[23581.82s -> 23593.66s]  not here today i'm enjoying my christmas like how desperate are you to continue to hey hey guys i i

[23612.78s -> 23630.90s]  presents and i have a lot of them here take a look at this watch that i got it just loops for a whole
[23630.90s -> 23658.84s]  24 hours run ads i would stay to watch that after you see it two or three times it would just
[23659.48s -> 23668.50s]  it would get so horrible or like i'm not here right now here's a compilation of some of my
[23668.50s -> 23675.56s]  funniest streams and it's just like a 15 20 minute compilation of like funny moments that happened
[23676.87s -> 23688.44s]  and then it just repeats it and by the way the funniest moments are boring dog shit like for
[23688.44s -> 23696.57s]  instance like just just boring stuff that wasn't even interesting walking down halls and they're
[23696.57s -> 23703.90s]  picking up keys and stuff or like letting just dialogue play of a game like for instance when i
[23703.90s -> 23710.76s]  was playing outer outer worlds have one of those sequences just be one of the characters
[23710.76s -> 23726.57s]  speaking that's it and i'm not talking wow what a fucking moment on stream huh there was a thing
[23726.57s -> 23733.35s]  that i did last year that i kind of wish i did even more was the the year in review and when
[23733.35s -> 23739.59s]  none of the clips even happened i would love to do like a full 10 minute version of that but it's
[23739.59s -> 23746.36s]  so difficult to do that because you have to actually what you guys don't understand is that
[23746.36s -> 23752.20s]  those clips i actually had to go into the the wolf among us and get to that part in the game
[23752.84s -> 23763.03s]  so it looked like this was really like halfway through the game i've i didn't stream any of those
[23763.03s -> 23770.82s]  things i was sitting there in my chair after having like three four five of the games clipped and
[23770.82s -> 23777.91s]  edited and i'm just going what the fuck else am i gonna even play and get like an hour into so it
[23777.91s -> 23793.50s]  looks real create an entire fake stream and reference it yeah there's a lot of weird things
[23793.50s -> 23803.61s]  to do you played wolf among us i mean i did i i played wolf among us in like 2014
[23804.73s -> 23818.81s]  not on video or anything or have like and let's take a look at some of those moments from last
[23818.81s -> 23824.33s]  year and it's all moments where i'm just mad at the chat and shit and just talking shit and being
[23824.41s -> 23840.71s]  vicious and horrible like i don't have any good moments i'm just mean and terrible like i'm not
[23840.71s -> 23850.60s]  even i'm i'm awful like telling people like shut the fuck up and stuff like that you don't know
[23850.60s -> 23856.65s]  shit dumb motherfucker yeah that's right ban that guy ban him i don't want to see him ever
[23856.65s -> 23867.74s]  fucking again in my chat ever again it's just shit like that horrible like 10 times in a row
[23867.74s -> 23874.52s]  and maybe there's one clip in the middle that's like weird and having fun all right good egg
[23874.92s -> 23881.88s]  thanks guys appreciate it you guys i love you guys you guys are the best i'm you guys are so
[23881.88s -> 23887.56s]  awesome like get some hearts in the chat it's right in the middle of me being just like screaming and
[23887.56s -> 23890.84s]  and yelling about how awful the games are and how like i hate chat and everything
[23891.64s -> 23913.05s]  yeah next clip it's freaking offensive it might be funny anyways uh well there's still time before

[23980.92s -> 23987.64s]  they streamed this for like six hours plus that time just melted to me it was like 45 minutes in
[23987.64s -> 23995.67s]  my brain i didn't have to go to the bathroom i haven't peed in seven hours oh shit i probably
[23995.67s -> 24002.68s]  should do that uh yeah new york thanks for the five community subs this was a few hours ago but

[24014.47s -> 24027.40s]  strong like a 10 plus view streamer that was crazy you know it's normal when
[24029.83s -> 24036.07s]  views view fluctuations happen all the time and like i don't really care but i will be honest
[24036.07s -> 24044.82s]  with you it was a moment when we were playing that werewolf game and uh dropped like a thousand
[24044.82s -> 24049.38s]  viewers and it's just like oh whatever that's that's whatever that's fine that's all right
[24050.10s -> 24055.78s]  but once it went like enough a thousand and it was going slow too it was not just like oh
[24056.34s -> 24063.14s]  you're at zero viewers is a glitch no no no it slowly slowly was ticking down to like 1600 and
[24063.14s -> 24069.50s]  i'm sitting there going this is is this people just leaving oh this is okay maybe i should do

[24162.52s -> 24178.81s]  command and conquer oh it's great i can't wait for the fmv cutscenes that's the best part

[25253.66s -> 25259.80s]  nobody knows what's going on so if you play like the first day or two that it's out for the most
[25259.80s -> 25267.67s]  part people don't know where everything is and don't know how to do everything it's great so i
[25267.67s -> 25272.15s]  can't pick like the wrong weapon and i have everybody scream at me because i'm using the
[25272.15s -> 25284.62s]  wrong katana what are we doing tomorrow we're gonna play red alert and if that doesn't work

[25301.10s -> 25312.46s]  happen on that stream so as of the game awards stream in two days either before or after the
