[1.85s -> 9.26s]  Hello everybody, or I'm dropping a lot of frames in the very beginning here.
[9.26s -> 15.34s]  Uh oh, this is a bad sign. Hopefully it situates itself
[15.34s -> 28.17s]  so we can stream a video game. Oof. Oof. Come on, pull it through here, man.
[28.17s -> 40.31s]  Pull it through. You can do it. Well, at least I hope so.
[40.31s -> 47.83s]  But, hello. If we're able to stream today, which we should be, hopefully.
[47.83s -> 53.45s]  Sam and Max, hope you're having a good day. And you all as well. I mean, not
[53.45s -> 60.58s]  just Sam and Max. I hope they have a great time on stream today.
[60.58s -> 65.26s]  Why are all the planets orbiting the moon? Uh,
[65.26s -> 70.38s]  because that's what it looks like through a telescope.
[70.38s -> 77.27s]  I don't, this, oh by the way, probably gonna get this remade as well.
[77.27s -> 84.10s]  Gonna add some planets, change it up a little bit.
[84.10s -> 93.67s]  You thought the title said what? Why? It's not moon.
[93.67s -> 97.86s]  That is the moon. But, uh, as of tomorrow,
[98.55s -> 101.67s]  I'll give you an internet update here. I've been told that
[101.67s -> 106.39s]  they're going to try to fix it tomorrow. Somewhere in the plant, who knows what
[106.39s -> 111.35s]  they're gonna do. But hopefully this is situated as of
[111.35s -> 114.76s]  tomorrow, or the next day. I'm gonna give them a couple days to
[114.76s -> 121.61s]  figure it out. But, yep, we're gonna do Sam and Max. We are at
[121.61s -> 126.39s]  the point in Sam and Max, episode three, season two.
[126.39s -> 130.79s]  Episode four, maybe. We'll do the two episodes, see where we're at.
[130.79s -> 135.75s]  Starting early because I have to go get Kim later.
[135.75s -> 146.04s]  So I want to be able to do that. Starting an hour or two early.
[146.04s -> 218.23s]  Give me one second, and we'll get started. All right,
[218.23s -> 224.30s]  let me move this out of the way. Man, I've dropped 20% of every frame
[224.30s -> 229.69s]  in five minutes. Fuck, that's not good.
[229.69s -> 235.58s]  That's actually a very, very bad sign to start the stream.
[235.58s -> 253.46s]  Not good. Not good at all. Give me, let's just hang out for a
[253.46s -> 256.26s]  minute. Because if this continues like this, I
[256.26s -> 264.34s]  might have to change my plan on the fly here. It wasn't this bad
[264.34s -> 269.51s]  yesterday, not even close. Well the day before that. But this
[269.51s -> 282.38s]  is like actually unbearable.
[282.38s -> 288.26s]  What mouse and keyboard do I use? I use an Amazon Basics keyboard.
[288.26s -> 300.78s]  And, that's true, I actually do. And a Razer Deathadder.
[300.78s -> 309.08s]  What a gamer. Yeah, Razer Deathadder and an Amazon Basics.
[309.08s -> 314.52s]  Well we're gonna, we're gonna try. Hopefully this
[314.52s -> 318.95s]  kind of gets over it in the next like 20 minutes or so.
[318.95s -> 321.99s]  If not then I have to change plans. We're gonna do something else because I
[321.99s -> 325.51s]  don't want to be dropping 20% of all my frames and try to
[325.51s -> 328.23s]  play something. But we'll, let's go. Let's give it a
[328.23s -> 338.52s]  try. Hopefully it fixes itself. Anyways, let's get over here.
[338.52s -> 354.30s]  Ay, ay, ay. Just calm down Jeremy. You just have to just relax.
[354.30s -> 359.35s]  Just relax. You don't have to, don't get angry. Don't start off in a bad
[359.35s -> 362.47s]  mood. Just relax. Breathe in, breathe out.
[362.47s -> 371.99s]  Let's breathe in. Let's do it together. And then breathe in.
[371.99s -> 376.14s]  I think collectively if we all do this at the same time, then it'll be
[376.14s -> 380.34s]  maybe I'll get even more calm down, you know.
[380.34s -> 385.13s]  If there's like 1200 people all doing this at the same time,
[385.13s -> 390.71s]  it's gonna affect me. I'm gonna get all of your energies
[390.71s -> 393.59s]  and I won't elevate, I'm not gonna elevate my voice today. We're gonna
[393.59s -> 398.89s]  stay silent like this. All right, let me
[398.89s -> 402.25s]  restart because with this game, as you know, it
[402.25s -> 406.02s]  kind of just jumps right into it. Again, this is season two, episode
[406.02s -> 409.75s]  three. And I would like to start a new game.
[409.75s -> 413.78s]  Keep doing what you're doing, everybody. Keep like breathing in and
[413.78s -> 417.94s]  breathing out slowly because it like fixed the internet.
[417.94s -> 421.69s]  It definitely didn't, but you know. Here we go.
[421.69s -> 437.32s]  You have interfered with my plans for the last time, Sam and Ma.
[437.32s -> 441.24s]  Taking your- I did already see this. You'll satisfy my dark masters once
[441.24s -> 445.24s]  and for all. And then I will use my army of the undead to take
[445.24s -> 449.16s]  over the world.
[449.16s -> 455.48s]  Damn you, JÃ¼rgen! I never thought he'd go for the cheesy evil laugh.
[455.48s -> 460.28s]  Insolent to the last. No matter. Oh, we shall see how you make me
[460.28s -> 465.56s]  some ice cracks after you are dead. Oh, looks like this is it, little buddy.
[465.56s -> 470.60s]  My whole life is flashing before my eyes. I wondered why I left my wallet.
[470.60s -> 473.64s]  I can't even remember how we got here. Come on, Max.
[473.64s -> 477.88s]  Remember, we were back in the office just back from Easter Island.
[477.88s -> 481.16s]  Wait, wait. Do the whole thing with the music and all that.
[481.16s -> 488.34s]  Oh, please shoot in the intro. Yeah, don't worry. I will. I'm gonna
[488.34s -> 506.15s]  get them all. Here we go. We can't- Dude, I need
[506.15s -> 511.69s]  to play some more of these types of games.
[511.69s -> 516.30s]  I gotta get some more, like, mouse shooters. I feel like I'm pretty good at
[516.30s -> 523.48s]  them. Doesn't being High Priest of Easter Island
[523.48s -> 527.32s]  and President violate the separation of church and state?
[527.32s -> 539.67s]  Blasphemy! Hitler is giving me a religious vision!
[539.67s -> 550.22s]  He's turning into Beavis. He's turning into, like, a corn holio.
[550.22s -> 561.99s]  Hey, not bad. Hello, Commissioner?
[567.69s -> 572.09s]  Wait, what? Not making so much noise? Speak up, Commissioner. I can't hear you.
[572.09s -> 575.29s]  We're having a zombie attack. What's that, Commissioner?
[575.29s -> 579.45s]  Zombie attacks? Jen running George A. Romero in a baby doll t-shirt outside
[579.45s -> 582.01s]  the food court with a $43 gift certificate.
[582.01s -> 585.45s]  We're on the case. The Commissioner says zombie attacks are popping up all
[585.53s -> 588.89s]  over the world. Is he washing his armpits? Boils on the decaying flesh of,
[588.89s -> 594.33s]  well, a zombie. Wait, who's attacking? They're coming from some place called
[594.33s -> 600.73s]  the Zombie Factory. Ha ha, zombies! Zombie attacks! You wander around aimlessly
[600.73s -> 603.93s]  and see what you can turn up. Meanwhile, I'll actually figure out
[603.93s -> 607.61s]  where they're coming from. One step ahead of you!
[607.61s -> 614.17s]  All right, so, Salmon Max. Let's increase the volume a little bit
[614.17s -> 619.11s]  to get that authentic Salmon Max experience.
[619.11s -> 624.44s]  Welcome, everybody. That was the opening cut scene. Zombie apocalypse.
[624.44s -> 633.24s]  Incoming. See, I think the internet has settled.
[633.24s -> 636.52s]  It's still kind of not good, but this guy's still in here.
[636.52s -> 645.91s]  He's been in here for like three weeks. Hey, Leonard.
[645.91s -> 650.15s]  Is there any lore? Do we feed this guy? Does he eat?
[650.15s -> 657.35s]  Or does Jimmy? I think I hear a tiny tumbleweed blowing by your side. No, no, he's still
[657.35s -> 660.07s]  alive. Yeah, but like, we have to feed him. We can't just like
[660.07s -> 666.17s]  let him die in there. All right. I just want to look around
[666.17s -> 668.17s]  the office a little bit. It's been a while. We got
[668.17s -> 671.21s]  Melee Earhart sure screamed bloody blue murder when we yanked her chair out
[671.21s -> 676.34s]  from under her. She's a baby. He uses photosynthesis.
[676.34s -> 679.94s]  Someone's setting up thousands of dominoes across the street.
[679.94s -> 683.06s]  Talk about way too much time on your hands. Says the guy
[683.06s -> 686.90s]  watching someone set up thousands of dominoes.
[686.90s -> 690.10s]  Should I do that? I'm doing that one day. All right, I'm doing that like
[690.10s -> 696.50s]  soon. I'm doing that as soon as fucking possible.
[696.50s -> 699.46s]  I'm gonna do a full domino setup when I'm gonna like
[699.46s -> 711.69s]  set a ball up and knock him down somewhere. Yeah.
[711.69s -> 716.30s]  Yeah, we are. I'm doing a full domino. Okay, they're actually, this is a zombie
[716.30s -> 721.32s]  puzzle. All right. Well, what do you, Jimmy,
[721.32s -> 724.94s]  what's going on here? What do you think?
[724.94s -> 728.46s]  The rats have set up their own little casino.
[728.46s -> 732.70s]  I want to show them a new sleeper hole I learned. The boss is busy.
[732.70s -> 736.22s]  He can't be too busy for us. We're the ones who gave him his big break.
[736.22s -> 739.42s]  Not to mention various smaller fractures and sprains. That's legitimately
[739.42s -> 745.10s]  the only thing worse than another nintendo labo stream.
[745.10s -> 751.61s]  Not if I, not if I hire like five people to help me do it, you know?
[751.61s -> 758.30s]  Not if I hired like five people and we make a huge one.
[758.30s -> 763.34s]  Clowns. Is there anything about the zombie factory?
[763.34s -> 768.06s]  Nope. We're screwed, Sam. That rat was our only lead.
[768.06s -> 771.10s]  Next labo stream confirmed. All right, can we talk to the zombies? Beat it,
[771.10s -> 778.36s]  deadbeat. Roll again.
[778.76s -> 788.15s]  All right, what about this giant stein? So the zombies drink beer. Flu, perhaps?
[788.15s -> 791.93s]  Let's press on. All right, so they drink, so they're not actually zombies.
[791.93s -> 796.65s]  They're just like drunk? The zombies beer stein.
[796.65s -> 799.85s]  Are they, are these just like really drunk people?
[799.85s -> 805.18s]  All right, what do I think down here? Let's start all the way. Zombies eat for free
[805.18s -> 811.51s]  here. Let's check this out. He was the
[811.59s -> 816.31s]  only woman I ever loved. Make a Rube Goldberg machine.
[816.31s -> 819.99s]  Yeah, maybe you should talk about this with your therapist.
[819.99s -> 823.35s]  She was my therapist. I need to hire like an
[823.35s -> 826.79s]  engineer to be able to do that. Lamont and Wallace, you're here.
[826.79s -> 831.51s]  Sam and Max, actually. Whatever, your friend here is driving me crazy.
[831.51s -> 837.75s]  Take him off my hands, would you? What's wrong with Lincoln?
[837.75s -> 841.43s]  Lincoln, what's, what's going on? What's going on? I'm shaking, Abraham.
[841.43s -> 849.24s]  She's gone. Left me. Uh, you're talking about Sybil's gone?
[849.24s -> 852.84s]  Sybil! Yeah, yeah. Of course she left you.
[852.84s -> 855.72s]  She dumped you like yesterday's breakfast when she caught you macking
[855.72s -> 859.00s]  on the moai heads. I was sure it was just one of her
[859.00s -> 863.30s]  moods. Uh, have you heard anything about a
[863.30s -> 867.46s]  zombie factory? Do you mean like a factory that comes to life after it's
[867.46s -> 870.18s]  been shut down, cranking out products in a hideous
[870.18s -> 873.86s]  parody of actual production, destroying other factories it comes into contact
[873.86s -> 876.34s]  with? No, that's not what we're looking for.
[876.34s -> 881.13s]  But I wish we were. Uh, do you know anything about zombies? What do you know
[881.13s -> 885.69s]  about zombies? Pests, uligans, they always gather
[885.69s -> 891.21s]  outside the memorial with their million zombie rallies and groanings.
[891.21s -> 896.92s]  Always playing that awful music they listen to.
[896.92s -> 900.12s]  All right, well how do you stop a zombie? How do you stop a zombie?
[900.12s -> 904.04s]  Beats me. Just between the three of us. I'm pretty hopeless at anything
[904.04s -> 914.02s]  except making speeches. Okay. What? That doesn't sound right.
[914.02s -> 917.38s]  Let's do all dialogue options. Take it like a man. Think of all the
[917.38s -> 922.89s]  advantages of being single. Like what? Cox Jupiter. Yeah, this is
[922.89s -> 927.45s]  really bad. I'm so desperately trying to swallow
[927.45s -> 934.79s]  my rage right now. You have no idea. If the webcam was on, I keep looking
[934.79s -> 936.55s]  over here and seeing it go down to like
[936.55s -> 940.65s]  zero and I like if their webcam was on you would see like
[940.65s -> 953.69s]  like this. Ready? This is what I'm doing. Ready? Look at this. Every like
[953.69s -> 956.09s]  like minute or two uh this is what you this is what I do. Like I'm looking
[956.09s -> 965.11s]  over here I'm like trying to pay attention and I look over and I go
[965.11s -> 969.19s]  it happens like every 30 seconds. I gotta fucking like just
[969.19s -> 974.47s]  chill. I'm so fucking like tortured right now. I am
[974.47s -> 979.86s]  being dying tortured. I look like Abraham Lincoln.
[979.86s -> 998.55s]  What?
[999.99s -> 1007.94s]  That's fine. That's fine with me. Hey Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs.
[1007.94s -> 1013.50s]  He is a lot taller than I am but thank you Kazzy.
[1013.50s -> 1016.86s]  He's like seven feet tall. You can do what you want when you want.
[1016.86s -> 1022.42s]  You answer to nobody and nobody cares if you die.
[1022.42s -> 1025.78s]  Play the feeling. You can meet lots of new people and have a never-ending
[1025.78s -> 1028.98s]  string of shallow unfulfilling encounters. Grow a
[1028.98s -> 1039.61s]  Lincoln beard for next stream. I don't think I could do that.
[1039.61s -> 1042.89s]  I don't think this is helping. We seem to be working at cross purposes Max.
[1042.89s -> 1046.81s]  Maybe but this way I get to annoy two people at once.
[1046.81s -> 1050.95s]  Do it. I can't grow a beard. Don't you guys understand?
[1050.95s -> 1054.63s]  Keep a stiff hairless upper lip Abe. Soup store thanks to the five community
[1054.63s -> 1058.81s]  subs. Thank you soup store. Back to back five community sub drops
[1058.81s -> 1066.44s]  here. Thanks a lot guys. Any items in here? Dude you know what
[1066.44s -> 1071.35s]  actually might be causing this internet problem here? And that always
[1071.35s -> 1075.11s]  seems to correlate with it. Is when we get these crazy fucking
[1075.11s -> 1080.18s]  wins. That's definitely what it is. It's just
[1080.18s -> 1082.98s]  like doing damage to something and then they gotta fix it. There's like
[1082.98s -> 1090.38s]  crazy wins. You probably hear it. Yeah whatever. I'm not gonna let it
[1090.38s -> 1097.67s]  bother me. Let's just play. I turn on the webcam and I'm like
[1097.91s -> 1103.99s]  hanging onto a pole sideways. Help! Finally I have the wherewithal to
[1103.99s -> 1111.34s]  get that prepared. Hiya cops. Do you know?
[1111.34s -> 1114.78s]  Are you tired of paying a lot for your internet service?
[1114.78s -> 1118.78s]  What? Yeah actually I am. Well those days are over.
[1118.78s -> 1121.50s]  Welcome to a new type of internet access.
[1121.50s -> 1126.62s]  S.O.L. So simple even a zombie could use it.
[1126.62s -> 1133.16s]  Yeah it's pretty cool. Do you know anything about it?
[1133.96s -> 1140.44s]  Processing. We have gathered extensive marketing data on zombies.
[1140.44s -> 1144.92s]  Zombies need an easier less expensive way to access the internet.
[1144.92s -> 1149.32s]  That's why we developed Stuttgart online for the greatest concentration of
[1149.32s -> 1153.24s]  newly active zombies. Stuttgart Germany.
[1153.24s -> 1156.60s]  You've unlocked a new area. What'd he say that for?
[1156.60s -> 1161.96s]  We do not know. He has been like this ever since the accident.
[1161.96s -> 1165.40s]  Max when I'm done yammering remind me we gotta drive to Stuttgart.
[1165.40s -> 1170.36s]  Quick like a zombie. Drive to Stuttgart. Right forgot it already.
[1170.36s -> 1174.12s]  Okay so you're selling the internet to zombies.
[1174.12s -> 1178.28s]  Not just the internet but much much more.
[1178.28s -> 1181.56s]  From trivia to music, lifestyles to death styles,
[1181.56s -> 1186.20s]  and inventive new recipes for brains. Stuttgart online is the premier online.
[1186.20s -> 1189.40s]  Dude that's where the best internet is. What am I thinking? I gotta move to
[1189.40s -> 1194.94s]  Stuttgart. Everyone move to EU. Move to EU. I keep
[1194.94s -> 1201.02s]  hearing it. All right let's go. Stuttgart.
[1201.02s -> 1206.70s]  Didn't we destroy the internet? Luckily Elgor was able to recreate the
[1206.70s -> 1211.10s]  internet from his original plans. What's on the internet that would
[1211.10s -> 1214.22s]  interest a droning glassy eyed zombie anyway?
[1214.22s -> 1220.63s]  Elgor recreated the internet in his own image.
[1220.87s -> 1223.51s]  What is so great about Stuttgart online?
[1223.51s -> 1226.79s]  It's the fun easy to use online experience for
[1226.79s -> 1234.17s]  zombies and zombies at heart. Okay what about the car? We just want to
[1234.17s -> 1238.49s]  pimp our car. We no longer offer car upgrades.
[1238.49s -> 1242.09s]  Our income has been lower than previously forecast.
[1242.09s -> 1246.25s]  But this neighborhood has the highest accident rate in five states.
[1246.25s -> 1249.21s]  We have spent a lot of this year out of town Max.
[1249.29s -> 1254.17s]  So we've devoted our resources to developing the ultimate
[1254.17s -> 1259.13s]  online experience SOL. He finally wants to upgrade.
[1259.13s -> 1261.29s]  All right well what happened to the other thing? What happened to bluster
[1261.29s -> 1263.53s]  blaster? Where's bluster blaster? There was a
[1263.53s -> 1269.61s]  processing accident while developing our latest invention.
[1269.61s -> 1274.17s]  And finds him. Haddock is the best kind of fish. He's a different person.
[1274.17s -> 1279.37s]  And finds him. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused.
[1279.37s -> 1283.85s]  And finds him. Thanks for asking. And finds you.
[1283.85s -> 1289.27s]  And finds you. I like that one. That's a good one.
[1289.27s -> 1292.31s]  Can you guys fix it? Can you guys fix bluster blaster?
[1292.31s -> 1296.79s]  They had me fixed before they brought me home. He sounds like Homer.
[1296.79s -> 1301.48s]  It is Homer Simpson. After all this time
[1301.48s -> 1305.48s]  you're not offering any car upgrades? None at all.
[1305.56s -> 1313.16s]  We regret the invention. It is much too dangerous.
[1313.16s -> 1318.44s]  Intrigued? Go on. It's the super high-powered antenna for wireless
[1318.44s -> 1323.96s]  internet access while on the road. There are problems. Using it could
[1323.96s -> 1328.36s]  result in catastrophic electrical failure and spontaneous explosion of
[1328.36s -> 1331.32s]  your vehicle. Yeah it is. And what are the
[1331.40s -> 1336.60s]  problems? You're right. We want the antenna. Super high powered antenna.
[1336.60s -> 1341.00s]  We spent our entire savings on development.
[1341.00s -> 1344.68s]  We can only give it to you if you help us market SOL.
[1344.68s -> 1347.96s]  Take the provided CD launcher and use it to give
[1347.96s -> 1351.88s]  installation discs to zombies throughout the city.
[1351.88s -> 1354.92s]  We like marketing. And we love shooting things.
[1354.92s -> 1361.24s]  I like wearing short pants. Would you like to begin driving now?
[1361.40s -> 1370.06s]  Yes. Affirmative. Initiating augmented reality driving sequence.
[1370.06s -> 1375.10s]  Do the droopy boys. Wait wait wait. Is this pizza?
[1375.10s -> 1379.34s]  Not pizza. Pizza man? What's the newspaper one?
[1379.34s -> 1383.98s]  Newspaper throw? Paper boy. There it is.
[1383.98s -> 1387.98s]  I want to shoot things. Please deliver the magic of SOL
[1387.98s -> 1391.26s]  to the displayed number of zombies. 10 zombies.
[1391.26s -> 1396.46s]  We'll make that big. And you must do it in the allotted time.
[1396.46s -> 1403.14s]  Pizza man. Ready go. Do I have a cursor?
[1403.14s -> 1412.20s]  Um what's going on? Why is my cursor off the screen?
[1412.20s -> 1430.26s]  How do I? Okay it's right click. I'm sitting there driving into him.
[1430.26s -> 1436.86s]  This is newspaper man. Congratulations you won. He said that.
[1436.94s -> 1442.36s]  Well done. We've installed your new super high powered antenna.
[1442.36s -> 1447.80s]  We cannot be held liable for any injury or loss of life.
[1447.80s -> 1450.92s]  I'm liking the sound of this more and more.
[1450.92s -> 1455.24s]  Please demonstrate the operation of the antenna to our big winner.
[1455.24s -> 1459.00s]  Not too late. I don't want to see the bright light again.
[1459.00s -> 1465.22s]  Very well. Do the droopy boys. All right I will.
[1466.18s -> 1469.78s]  Oh boy. Oh no.
[1472.81s -> 1477.50s]  Got it. All right so we got the antenna. What does this do? So we can now
[1477.50s -> 1484.31s]  somebody say what the fuck is this? Wow. Salmon man. We installed something
[1484.31s -> 1487.67s]  well for once. I won't be able to just pull it off.
[1487.67s -> 1492.30s]  Okay so we got the antenna. Let's go. I didn't talk to Stinky.
[1492.30s -> 1513.69s]  I'll make sure I have a conversation with Stinky. Now do Garfield.
[1513.69s -> 1517.05s]  All right we want to. Ever heard of a zombie factory? You know anything about
[1517.05s -> 1522.09s]  a zombie factory? Oh sure. I was a foreman at a zombie
[1522.09s -> 1525.37s]  factory for a year while I was writing my opera.
[1525.37s -> 1529.69s]  They're good workers as long as you don't let them unionize.
[1529.69s -> 1533.69s]  No this isn't a factory that hires zombies. It's a factory that makes
[1533.69s -> 1538.81s]  zombies. Oh well then uh did you say zombies?
[1538.81s -> 1545.51s]  I thought you said elves. Elves? Zombies giving you much trouble Stinky?
[1545.51s -> 1549.19s]  If that is your real name. To the German boys. Oh no.
[1549.19s -> 1552.87s]  They're a nuisance but at least they eat quickly and leave.
[1552.87s -> 1558.54s]  Your friend Lincoln is the real horror.
[1558.54s -> 1562.30s]  Hey it's it's the voice that I do when I do somebody that's not me.
[1562.30s -> 1565.90s]  Literally almost 90 percent of people that I do a voice for it sounds
[1565.90s -> 1568.28s]  like this. Is that what you're looking for?
[1572.87s -> 1576.39s]  So have you heard from grandpa Stinky lately?
[1576.39s -> 1582.47s]  Like from beyond the grave? What are you talking about? Grandpa's still on his
[1582.47s -> 1589.93s]  Himalayan mountain climbing junket. I thought you said grandpa Stinky was
[1589.93s -> 1593.93s]  on an around the world cruise. Let's watch as the spider tries to
[1593.93s -> 1598.33s]  free herself from her own web of lies. Oh he sent me a
[1598.33s -> 1601.45s]  postcard. His cruise was hijacked by Sherpa
[1601.45s -> 1605.69s]  terrorists. They ended up making him their god and now they're following him
[1605.69s -> 1608.57s]  on a quest to scale the world's tallest peaks.
[1608.57s -> 1617.10s]  Well her story does seem to hold up. Do Kylo Ren?
[1617.10s -> 1621.18s]  Okay give Abe a break. Come on give Abe a break. He's on the rebound.
[1621.18s -> 1624.70s]  He keeps trying to pay me in confederate money. Who does that?
[1624.70s -> 1631.21s]  That doesn't even make sense. It was pretty nice of grandpa Stinky to
[1631.21s -> 1634.01s]  leave his entire restaurant empire to you.
[1634.01s -> 1638.09s]  Some empire? Zombies, deadbeat ex-presidents,
[1638.09s -> 1642.25s]  trivia cheaters. Makes me wonder if it was worth the effort.
[1642.25s -> 1646.42s]  If what was worth the effort? Oh nothing.
[1646.42s -> 1649.46s]  All right what's going on with the sun lamp? What's with a sun lamp woman
[1649.46s -> 1651.94s]  who will call Stinky for the sake of convenience?
[1651.94s -> 1656.58s]  So that's what that is. Oh I mean of course that's what that is.
[1656.58s -> 1661.14s]  Have to look my best you know. The magazine set such an unrealistic
[1661.14s -> 1664.42s]  standard of beauty for grandpa murderers.
[1664.42s -> 1668.71s]  Can we have the sun lamp? Can we have your sun lamp? What could you
[1668.71s -> 1671.67s]  possibly need it for? Does she just admit to killing her father? Max needs a UV bulb for his
[1671.67s -> 1675.59s]  teeth bleaching regimen. You think a smile this wife comes naturally?
[1675.59s -> 1681.35s]  Well go ahead. Teeth bleaching. I don't need I mean I'm done with it.
[1681.35s -> 1684.95s]  Why wait why do you she said some beauty doing in a restaurant?
[1684.95s -> 1687.35s]  Did you think the food wasn't hazardous enough without the threat of
[1687.35s -> 1690.39s]  melanoma? Oh that I was just going through some
[1690.47s -> 1693.83s]  of the old things Stinky grandpa had in storage.
[1693.83s -> 1697.19s]  I need a big box for packing things that need to be sent
[1697.19s -> 1703.34s]  away. Okay let's order some. We'd like to order something.
[1703.34s -> 1707.42s]  Supplies are low because of the zombie attacks so uh we're probably out.
[1707.42s -> 1710.62s]  You do realize that's not going to stop us right?
[1710.62s -> 1717.10s]  Go ahead. Do you have any enchiladas? Crab and salamander enchiladas in
[1717.10s -> 1720.06s]  green sauce. Sal I want new jobs in Greta
[1720.06s -> 1725.11s]  van Suster and doing double dutch on the back of a rogue elephant.
[1725.11s -> 1730.07s]  I'd like what's the special today? My special gooey molasses tar cake.
[1730.07s -> 1734.15s]  It's an ancient family recipe. Ancient? You've heard of the labrea
[1734.15s -> 1737.59s]  tar pits of course but have you ever tasted them?
[1737.59s -> 1742.23s]  So I'll take two slices. Sorry I used up the blowtorch on some
[1742.23s -> 1745.75s]  zombies who didn't tip. Are we ever going to meet the guy in the back?
[1745.75s -> 1749.43s]  You're welcome to look at it though just don't touch.
[1749.43s -> 1754.07s]  Okay so we can take the lamp. Let's just see what this is. Seared grouper in a
[1754.07s -> 1758.07s]  maple syrup reduction with bacon wrapped dates and toffee chips
[1758.07s -> 1761.43s]  served on a bed of Venezuelan newspaper clippings. Sal
[1761.43s -> 1767.85s]  number three. Chicken chow mein with chocolate covered raisins and a
[1767.85s -> 1770.97s]  caramel swirl. Sal give me a hyperactive spider
[1770.97s -> 1773.93s]  monkey and a powder blue cardigan and why don't we go ahead and wrestle
[1773.93s -> 1775.85s]  them to the ground and tickle them till they piece.
[1775.85s -> 1781.56s]  I have got to see what goes on in this kitchen.
[1781.64s -> 1786.04s]  Nothing for us thanks. Let's go get the sign.
[1786.04s -> 1795.86s]  Want to help me carry this thing around Max? I just want the bulb.
[1795.86s -> 1800.34s]  Get the bulb. Did you just get deja vu?
[1800.34s -> 1807.08s]  Just close your eyes and it'll pass. I'm looking over here with 12,000 drop
[1807.08s -> 1811.11s]  frames in 30 minutes. Usually I have like
[1811.11s -> 1815.91s]  ah that's so bad. 12,000 drop frames in 30 minutes is like
[1815.91s -> 1821.75s]  150,000 drop frames for the stream.
[1821.75s -> 1854.66s]  Fuck me. It's hard. I'm gonna just relax. No no no no no just
[1854.66s -> 1860.30s]  relax. It's gonna pass. It'll pass in like 30 20 minutes or
[1860.30s -> 1867.06s]  so. It's gonna pass and nothing will be fine.
[1867.06s -> 1874.58s]  Do you breathing? I'm trying to do my breathing. So we have a
[1874.90s -> 1884.01s]  light bulb. 2% calm.
[1884.01s -> 1889.10s]  Get lost. He's gonna start crying. It's just
[1889.10s -> 1905.27s]  very distracting.
[1906.07s -> 1911.42s]  Okay I'm fine. It's closed. Bosco went into hiding when we
[1911.42s -> 1915.74s]  convinced him T H E M were coming. Bosco's not
[1915.74s -> 1923.54s]  available anymore? Wait that's not true but I can't
[1923.54s -> 1930.18s]  talk to Bosco? It's closed.
[1930.34s -> 1947.24s]  It's getting worse. I need I need positive breathing.
[1947.24s -> 1956.81s]  Jerma call Jerma. He's crying. All right so what can I do with the bulb?
[1956.81s -> 1960.41s]  It's the UV bulb from stinky sun lamp. Can I
[1960.41s -> 1970.86s]  put that onto zombies? Six seconds in six seconds out six seconds in six
[1970.86s -> 1982.49s]  seconds out. I'm not sure quite where I'd stick it.
[1982.49s -> 1986.65s]  I thought like I thought starting early was supposed to
[1986.65s -> 1990.82s]  prevent the internet problems. It usually starts later. At least the last
[1990.82s -> 2005.08s]  like week it has. Okay let's go over to Sybil's.
[2005.08s -> 2009.40s]  Take a number and I'll be with you. Oh hey Sybil. Hi Sam and Max.
[2009.40s -> 2012.44s]  I'm uh out of applications right now so
[2012.44s -> 2017.16s]  uh let's just be friends. Sure. What happened to Abe?
[2017.16s -> 2020.36s]  I'm sure I don't know to whom you are referring.
[2020.36s -> 2027.72s]  So Mr. Mollman. Oh it's him. Sorry. He's back. Harry tell me more about
[2027.72s -> 2034.98s]  you. Well let me see interesting things about me.
[2034.98s -> 2050.71s]  You got nothing. That's it. He's got nothing.
[2050.71s -> 2056.38s]  Harry Mollman last time we saw you you were. Yeah yeah on the moon.
[2056.38s -> 2059.26s]  What's all this I keep hearing about zombie attacks?
[2059.26s -> 2065.02s]  They're everywhere. You boys have guns right? Are we just not getting through to
[2065.02s -> 2067.90s]  these people? Yeah we're really not that complicated
[2067.90s -> 2072.50s]  Harry. How's the suitor business? How are things
[2072.50s -> 2076.74s]  going with you and Sybil? Oh she's playing hard to get but
[2076.74s -> 2082.10s]  women have a hard time resisting my charms.
[2082.10s -> 2086.10s]  Oh she'll grope about me. High speed and have all the markets
[2086.10s -> 2089.30s]  started for me.
[2098.33s -> 2102.86s]  I'm sorry guys. There's nothing I can do.
[2102.86s -> 2106.86s]  Oh what do I do? What do I do about it? You know?
[2106.86s -> 2121.53s]  Oh it's all right. What do I do? Nice spam chat. Very cool. Coxy pasta.
[2121.53s -> 2125.69s]  I'm hoping that it just stops but right now it's
[2125.69s -> 2128.81s]  it's almost like I shouldn't play this until it does stop.
[2128.81s -> 2133.10s]  Like it's almost like I should just turn the webcam on and fucking smile at you
[2133.10s -> 2143.91s]  until like it's certain that I'm not gonna drop 20 fucking thousand frames.
[2143.91s -> 2146.71s]  We'll see if this goes on for like another 20 minutes or so I'm gonna
[2146.71s -> 2148.79s]  have to we'll have to do something else because it really is
[2148.79s -> 2153.35s]  this is getting to be just unbearable. I hate to break it to you Harry but
[2153.35s -> 2157.91s]  Sybil's not that into you. She's more into the whole hard rock scene.
[2157.91s -> 2161.43s]  Just wait till she gets a load of my oboe.
[2161.43s -> 2165.35s]  Was that clumsy innuendo or a pathetic attempt to sound cool?
[2165.35s -> 2171.19s]  Both. And you have no shot. You really think you have a chance with Sybil?
[2171.19s -> 2178.39s]  I'm in it to win it. All right do you know anything about the
[2178.39s -> 2180.95s]  zombie factory? Do you know anything about a zombie factory?
[2180.95s -> 2184.55s]  Zombies don't make things. They break them.
[2184.55s -> 2188.47s]  No it's a factory that makes zombies. Inconceivable.
[2188.47s -> 2192.23s]  That's like making hate and evil and awfulness.
[2192.23s -> 2197.21s]  So you're saying you don't like zombies?
[2197.21s -> 2200.65s]  Oh okay. What have you got against zombies?
[2200.65s -> 2204.25s]  Disgusting creatures. They're always breaking things.
[2204.25s -> 2210.09s]  Zombies are why we can't have nice things.
[2210.09s -> 2214.17s]  Zombies why zombies break things? Zombies is that they break things?
[2214.17s -> 2218.97s]  Yes stupid clumsy undead. And that bothers you more than the brain
[2218.97s -> 2223.54s]  eating? They're hell on knickknacks.
[2223.54s -> 2226.18s]  But oh he's still doing prismatology. Are you still into prismatology?
[2226.18s -> 2230.66s]  Oh no. Between the four of us I wasn't that into it in the first place.
[2230.66s -> 2233.86s]  You just relocated to the moon for it.
[2233.86s -> 2238.89s]  Well think how great docent looks on a resume.
[2238.89s -> 2243.67s]  You just relocated to the moon. What are you doing for work these days?
[2243.67s -> 2247.51s]  Well I'm hoping the stipend from this job holds me over.
[2247.51s -> 2250.79s]  Sybil's paying men to be her suitor? Of course not.
[2250.79s -> 2265.45s]  But they don't know that. That's Marge. See you later Harry. Zombie!
[2265.45s -> 2274.07s]  That was like a peaked Mike scream. All right anything in here besides talking
[2274.07s -> 2281.22s]  to Sybil. Let's see. Makes me feel like I'm in a deli. I am
[2281.22s -> 2287.45s]  not piece of meat. What gives Sybil? Did you start your
[2287.45s -> 2291.61s]  dating service again? Not quite. All my clients are applying
[2291.61s -> 2295.37s]  for dates with me. As kind of officers of the law we
[2295.37s -> 2297.61s]  have to point out that that's kind of illegal.
[2297.61s -> 2301.13s]  Does that mean we can shoot her to regain health points or something?
[2301.13s -> 2305.93s]  What? No. Get your heads out of the gutter. It's not like that.
[2305.93s -> 2312.54s]  I'm looking for my soul mate. How are you gonna do that? How are you
[2312.54s -> 2315.42s]  going to find your soul mate? Not by jumping in with the first
[2315.42s -> 2320.38s]  reanimated statue that comes along. That's for sure. I've got the
[2320.38s -> 2324.22s]  initial screening and then rigorous interviews and
[2324.22s -> 2332.01s]  finally the soul mater. I want it. The soul mater?
[2332.01s -> 2336.97s]  What does the soul mater do? Not sure. I want it in an online auction and the
[2336.97s -> 2341.61s]  instructions are all in Sanskrit. Something about ripping souls from
[2341.61s -> 2344.09s]  across the plains to reunite them with
[2344.09s -> 2349.13s]  corruptible mortal vessels. Doesn't that sound romantic? I could
[2349.13s -> 2351.93s]  just die. Sounds like a very real possibility.
[2352.01s -> 2358.07s]  What's going on with the picture? You can still clearly tell who that is.
[2358.07s -> 2361.59s]  All you did is you just you just gave like Abraham Lincoln
[2361.59s -> 2370.28s]  Batman eyes. You just made him Batman. All right do you know anything about
[2370.28s -> 2373.48s]  the zombies? Do you know anything about a place called the zombie factory?
[2373.48s -> 2380.28s]  Zombies? Where? Hmm. Irrational fear of zombies. I'll do a
[2380.28s -> 2383.96s]  Batman impression. Interesting. But yes I did get an email about
[2383.96s -> 2386.20s]  something like that from some friends in Europe
[2387.08s -> 2403.30s]  I'm sorry. That sucked. Sorry my mind is elsewhere right now.
[2403.30s -> 2410.04s]  That was pretty that was pretty that was pretty good Batman impression for
[2410.04s -> 2414.76s]  where my brain is at. Can we get the soul mater up with
[2414.76s -> 2417.88s]  that soul mater Sybil? If you're not married by now there's
[2417.88s -> 2421.88s]  not much time left. There's plenty of time. I still have a
[2421.88s -> 2426.04s]  lot of data to analyze while I figure out how the soul mater works.
[2428.22s -> 2433.50s]  Okay have you had a lot of applicants? A few. If you know anybody
[2433.50s -> 2439.34s]  anybody else of course send them my way. A lot of these guys have no chance
[2439.34s -> 2442.46s]  but I'm still interviewing them to be polite.
[2442.46s -> 2446.14s]  Speaking of which what kind of movies do you like Harry?
[2446.14s -> 2451.61s]  No I don't go to the movies that much because of my stigmatism.
[2451.61s -> 2463.72s]  Wait why couldn't you go to the movie?
[2463.72s -> 2466.76s]  Remember to lock up tonight so the zombies can't get in.
[2466.76s -> 2472.92s]  Get in? There are zombies right outside. I'm not going to lock my door.
[2472.92s -> 2476.68s]  This is a public place and they have the right to peacefully assemble
[2476.68s -> 2487.74s]  just like anyone else. It's nice knowing you chat. Wait what?
[2487.74s -> 2492.50s]  Oh man am I still live? That was a full-on zero.
[2492.50s -> 2507.13s]  Hello? I was at zero for like three straight seconds.
[2507.13s -> 2522.54s]  My blood is heating up. It's starting to get hot in here.
[2522.62s -> 2526.86s]  Six seconds in, six seconds out, six seconds in, six seconds out.
[2526.86s -> 2531.56s]  This is not like a walkie-talkie. It's like the fucking internet.
[2531.56s -> 2533.32s]  You know what I mean?
[2556.52s -> 2561.10s]  Sorry I didn't get that one. Over.
[2561.10s -> 2569.14s]  We have not much time.
[2569.14s -> 2571.30s]  Don't you want to give Abe another chance?
[2571.30s -> 2576.10s]  Abe who? You were telling me more about yourself Harry.
[2576.10s -> 2581.62s]  I was detailing my various prescriptions and inhalers if I remember correctly.
[2583.99s -> 2585.83s]  Yeah I'm just driving around through tunnels.
[2587.83s -> 2590.07s]  Streaming from my laptop. Just hold on guys.
[2590.63s -> 2592.39s]  Yeah I'm playing seven max.
[2593.42s -> 2597.02s]  I hired an uber driver to drive me through a tunnel back and forth.
[2611.46s -> 2612.42s]  We just went through one.
[2612.98s -> 2615.50s]  We just went through another tunnel. Hey we good?
[2617.42s -> 2618.06s]  How are you?
[2625.42s -> 2627.26s]  That seems like a waste of money.
[2627.26s -> 2630.79s]  Kind of like most North American internet.
[2649.70s -> 2652.18s]  LOL dude plus 40.
[2652.98s -> 2660.30s]  Good luck finding your soul mate.
[2660.30s -> 2662.78s]  This has nothing to do with blocks Sam.
[2662.78s -> 2672.34s]  I can't I can't guys I'm sorry.
[2673.06s -> 2674.82s]  We're gonna have to just hang out on camera.
[2676.52s -> 2680.49s]  This is 13 percent of the stream has been unwatchable.
[2682.09s -> 2687.82s]  It really is like every set it's just not I don't know I want to like enjoy it.
[2687.82s -> 2690.62s]  I don't want to have to keep because there's a lot of dialogue.
[2691.66s -> 2692.30s]  You know what I mean?
[2692.30s -> 2698.22s]  There's a shitload of dialogue that I don't want it to be like walkie talkie cutout drop down to zero.
[2698.22s -> 2704.07s]  So uh I'm sorry unfortunately that we have to change to do something else for a little while.
[2709.75s -> 2714.63s]  Uh this is this is the worst it's been since it started having problems again like last week.
[2714.63s -> 2717.03s]  So sorry everybody I really I really do apologize.
[2718.90s -> 2723.46s]  I'm not gonna let it get me annoyed or angry if for some reason we get green again in the next
[2724.26s -> 2726.10s]  20 minutes or so just hanging out.
[2726.90s -> 2737.27s]  Why is it always me and not other streamers?
[2737.27s -> 2741.03s]  What so many streamers deal with internet problems?
[2741.03s -> 2743.75s]  What do you mean I'm the only streamer you've ever seen with internet issues?
[2744.47s -> 2746.23s]  That's that's pretty rare.
[2747.03s -> 2752.14s]  All right let me just go like this.
[2752.86s -> 2763.61s]  You're the only streamer I've ever seen.
[2767.75s -> 2768.87s]  Nova's been fucked lately.
[2768.87s -> 2770.31s]  Yeah I've heard I heard about that too.
[2780.31s -> 2782.15s]  Call tech support on stream they don't do anything.
[2784.82s -> 2788.90s]  Me calling tech support on stream would be like funny for five seconds and then we would realize
[2789.62s -> 2791.54s]  oh they're just gonna tell me to turn my router off.
[2793.02s -> 2798.70s]  I'm just gonna ping your router and maybe that'll work.
[2799.82s -> 2803.90s]  It's gonna turn you off for a couple of minutes.
[2813.42s -> 2817.74s]  Well let's um well I don't know what am I gonna do now?
[2817.74s -> 2818.54s]  Let's go like this.
[2819.10s -> 2819.82s]  Hey!
[2819.82s -> 2834.49s]  That was gonna have a huge face cam right now.
[2834.49s -> 2835.53s]  Angry streamer?
[2835.53s -> 2837.13s]  No it's more defeated.
[2837.69s -> 2840.25s]  It's defeated streamer it's a little different.
[2840.25s -> 2844.92s]  He is ape Lincoln.
[2844.92s -> 2850.73s]  Let's talk about stream ideas.
[2854.09s -> 2855.69s]  Yeah I gotta change this.
[2855.69s -> 2858.97s]  If you if you're looking for Sam and Max and we'll do it again.
[2860.38s -> 2864.54s]  Maybe even later in like a little bit once we'll try to get this to go through here.
[2865.18s -> 2877.51s]  Let me just say what do I even title this stream right now?
[2880.14s -> 2884.66s]  Frames are depleting.
[2886.60s -> 2891.83s]  Frames are depleting.
[2891.83s -> 2895.00s]  Transformer?
[2895.00s -> 2899.03s]  Maybe I don't know I'm I'm kind of a little pissy right now.
[2899.03s -> 2901.27s]  I don't know if I would be like I don't think I could do it.
[2902.07s -> 2903.91s]  I'm like a little pissy right now.
[2903.91s -> 2906.31s]  I don't know if I could get in there be like okay let's have fun.
[2906.31s -> 2908.39s]  I'm like I'm kind of pissy.
