[1.34s -> 13.13s]  Okay, welcome to the stream. I hope you all had a good couple last days. My name's Jerma.
[13.69s -> 20.74s]  If you've never been here before, uh, welcome to the stream. Today we're gonna do some Dreamcast
[21.62s -> 28.25s]  and by do, I mean, probably finish the Dreamcast. I noticed my voice today, it's very low and
[28.25s -> 33.61s]  booming. I've been taking my booming voice supplements, I've been taking my vocal
[33.61s -> 47.67s]  supplements. So now I can do a radio commercial for a jewelry store. Ah, they give real bad diarrhea
[47.67s -> 53.06s]  though. I wouldn't recommend taking them. Anywho, we got a couple of announcements to make today.
[53.94s -> 59.67s]  Something that's been for a long time coming. Should have been here a long time ago,
[61.67s -> 74.73s]  but it's here now. And of course, what I mean is T-shirts! T-shirts! There's only one new one,
[74.73s -> 79.85s]  but these will be available forever. And I want to give just a quick little sneak peek of what
[79.85s -> 84.09s]  I am talking about here. So, uh, don't look at that! You're not supposed to see that yet.
[86.20s -> 90.28s]  So, uh, one of the ideas I had for a shirt, I thought it would be really, really cool,
[91.24s -> 98.86s]  uh, because I'm such a huge fan of Star Wars, right? So why not make my own Star
[98.86s -> 105.86s]  Wars shirt? I love Luke Skywalker, I love Darth Vader, so figured I was gonna have my own
[105.86s -> 114.22s]  version of a Star Wars shirt and here we are. This is the one. It's Darth Vader in front of a
[114.22s -> 121.22s]  fireplace for Christmas time. You know? Look, you understand? And I think you're gonna, I think
[121.22s -> 124.90s]  your friends are gonna laugh at this. I didn't make this though. This shirt has nothing to do
[124.90s -> 129.78s]  with me. I just think you should, like, get it. But this is what I meant by, like, T-shirt.
[129.78s -> 136.42s]  We're talking about, like, T-shirt day. See? I had nothing to do with any of this. But,
[136.42s -> 140.18s]  like, you and your friends might think it's funny, so you should, like, maybe get one.
[142.79s -> 154.28s]  Alright, let's show the real one! Here it is. So halfway through that, I just realized I could
[154.28s -> 158.76s]  have just been sued by Disney. So I kind of panicked and, uh, and stopped that immediately,
[159.48s -> 164.09s]  because that, that's not a lawsuit that I actually want. I realized that about halfway
[164.09s -> 184.36s]  through that joke. So here is what you can buy starting today and, uh, lasting forever.
[184.36s -> 194.81s]  Here it is. I think I just crashed my OBS. Holy shit. I just crashed OBS because I tried
[194.81s -> 206.55s]  to load this. Are we still here? Hello? I just overloaded OBS. Well, uh, alright. Anyway,
[207.72s -> 215.14s]  um, the whole stream just almost went down. I almost just broke my computer.
[216.79s -> 222.07s]  If you do exclamation point shirts, or if you just go to teespring.com slash store slash
[222.07s -> 230.65s]  germa985, uh, glue man is back in multiple colors, in multiple cuts, and the night sky is
[230.65s -> 237.82s]  the new shirt. I wish, I don't know why I just did this. Bear with me for a second while I try
[237.82s -> 257.30s]  to figure out what the hell that was. I just, uh, there we are, okay. Um, I think I have to,
[257.30s -> 260.18s]  alright, I'm gonna have to make this my, like, desktop background for some reason.
[260.74s -> 266.49s]  Why did this have to happen? The night sky is, uh, literally what happens when you look
[266.49s -> 281.37s]  through a telescope. Really? My computer. I actually can't, I'm just gonna make it my
[281.37s -> 285.21s]  fucking desktop because, like, this is, I don't know why this won't, this just won't work.
[288.38s -> 303.61s]  I can't open my file anymore. Oh, that's interesting. Anyways, restart computer. I can.
[304.57s -> 312.49s]  Where the fuck? Alright, I think my, like, computer just got electrocuted because, like,
[312.49s -> 319.32s]  I dropped, like, a thousand frames and it said overloading CPU and now I can't open files.
[320.60s -> 335.42s]  Why? Because I, what the fuck? Alright, well anyways, we're gonna play crazy taxi tonight.
[335.42s -> 340.55s]  Okay, I'm getting a lot of community subs here. Let me, this really just threw me off.
[340.55s -> 345.27s]  I have no fucking idea why this happened. I was gonna, like, show the image on screen
[345.27s -> 352.18s]  and it, my, my computer was electrocuted. Here. Let's just do, fucking, who cares? Fuck this.
[352.18s -> 362.46s]  Ready? Here we go. Uh, well, let me do this first because I want people to see what it
[362.46s -> 367.99s]  actually looks like. So this is an old one. This is the glue man shirt. This is what
[367.99s -> 372.73s]  you can expect. There are multiple colors now, though. There's, like, three or four colors,
[372.73s -> 379.61s]  so that's really cool. Uh, I don't think it's the exact same t-shirt, though. I believe
[379.93s -> 383.05s]  they no longer have these, like, American, American apparel doesn't exist anymore, right?
[384.31s -> 390.47s]  So I think it's next level tees. It's the highest goddamn quality I could possibly fucking
[390.47s -> 393.83s]  select and that's not even true either, but it was one, it was one of the highest quality
[393.83s -> 400.17s]  shirts I could buy to have them put on. It's like their premium t-shirt, whatever that
[400.17s -> 406.26s]  means. But, uh, that's what it looks like. I don't even know what color this is. This is,
[406.26s -> 412.42s]  like, that navy blue, maybe? All these were made, the, all the designs, both of them were
[412.42s -> 423.11s]  made by Ashley, so her link is in those descriptions. Name, name lag? Name lag? What's
[423.11s -> 443.96s]  name lag? Name lag? I didn't know! I didn't, we had it mirrored last time. That's what it
[443.96s -> 447.48s]  looks like. This is the shirt you're getting. This is, well, this is not the exact shirt,
[447.48s -> 452.81s]  but it's very close and they're available permanently. These are never, I'm not gonna,
[452.81s -> 456.57s]  I'm not gonna take these off. The Glueman shirt, the Night Sky shirt, they are both gonna be
[456.57s -> 462.58s]  available permanently, forever. That's a storefront. I can put other shit on that storefront.
[462.58s -> 466.26s]  Fucking Disney, don't even look at this shirt. You know, this is not even mine. That was a
[466.26s -> 471.30s]  joke I made. I want to reiterate that. That was just a comedy piece. Anyways, forever. I'm
[471.30s -> 475.38s]  not taking them down for any reason. They're always gonna be $20. Just, if you want one,
[475.94s -> 480.34s]  thank you. I hope you like the way it looks. And now we're gonna play Crazy Taxi and some
[480.34s -> 486.60s]  more Dreamcast shit. I want to fucking show this on, why can I not open files?
[491.22s -> 502.95s]  It worked like 35 minutes ago. Can you make hats? I can make a lot of shit in that store.
[505.43s -> 512.22s]  It's, there's a bunch of random storefronts and accessories and iPhone cases and there's a
[512.22s -> 521.70s]  lot of, you can do a lot. Please, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try one last fucking thing
[521.70s -> 525.30s]  because this is like a big deal. I haven't had a new shirt in like three or four years.
[525.30s -> 534.90s]  So let me just get this fucking situated because this is fucking dumb. I think I got it. Come on.
[538.02s -> 544.46s]  Come on. Yeah, I had to do a little bit of, I had to doctor a little bit of shit but I got it.
[546.18s -> 557.02s]  Okay, let's go over this shirt because I've seen a lot of people asking about what the
[557.02s -> 566.12s]  hell, what the heck is this? I haven't even seen it yet. There it is. Look at that, finally.
[567.00s -> 578.55s]  Hey, it only took up like fucking two years. Here is the night sky. This is the new shirt.
[578.55s -> 586.58s]  Just a father and son exploring the outdoors together, taking a look through the telescope.
[588.94s -> 596.50s]  Clear, beautiful. This is, at any point where you are right now, this is what you will see
[596.50s -> 607.66s]  when you look up. It's just, you know, me and my dad. Why can they see the earth?
[611.00s -> 631.70s]  What are you talking about? I mean, just, yeah. I mean, where are they in this scenario?
[631.70s -> 639.42s]  You know what I mean? That's the best part. Where are they? What fucking planet are you on?
[640.86s -> 644.14s]  No, this is father and son looking at the night sky through a telescope.
[645.14s -> 658.01s]  Okay, no Saturn. No, Saturn wasn't popular enough to be on the shirt. Sorry.
[658.01s -> 670.46s]  Only the popular planets get to fit on the t-shirt. If you understand, design choice wise,
[671.59s -> 680.76s]  unpopular planets can't fit on t-shirt. So that's how science works. If the planet's
[680.76s -> 689.24s]  not popular, they're just fucking delete it. They don't care. Yeah, that means that they're
[689.24s -> 696.10s]  on one of those planets. And guys, Saturn and Mercury, they could, they could be behind that.
[696.10s -> 699.48s]  They're behind there somewhere. See the moon? The moon's very large.
[700.28s -> 704.92s]  Bigger than the sun. So of course that, like, Mercury could probably be behind the moon.
[704.92s -> 708.82s]  This is just what's available from this National Geographic Photographer's angle.
[709.46s -> 724.76s]  Why do they need a telescope if the planet's that big? Because you want to make,
[724.84s -> 734.04s]  you want to see what's on the fucking surface. And how do you know that? We don't know where this
[734.04s -> 745.27s]  photo could be taken from. What do you want to see the crevices? You want to, like,
[745.27s -> 757.66s]  what's behind the moon? What's, where are the asteroids? But all jokes aside, this is,
[757.66s -> 765.03s]  I love this design. I think it's great. I think it'll look good on, on any chest.
[770.50s -> 778.49s]  It's a lovely, lovely, lovely t-shirt. Yeah, like you guys could be looking through
[778.49s -> 783.93s]  the telescope. Right? This is, this is potentially two or three different angles
[783.93s -> 794.04s]  melded together in a beautiful fucking incredible design. Don't you understand? That's you
[794.04s -> 807.14s]  looking through that scope. Don't you get it? But I have to thank, again, this is Ashley
[807.14s -> 815.69s]  for the incredible artwork and realizing half the dumb shit that I said to her. That's really,
[815.69s -> 820.41s]  really fantastic. Thank you so much. It looks great. And you all know what the Glooman
[820.41s -> 832.31s]  one looks like, but this is the new one. This shirt is only available in black for very obvious
[832.31s -> 837.03s]  reasons because it's supposed to, the father and son in the telescope are supposed to be
[837.03s -> 842.79s]  silhouettes. So putting, you know, that wouldn't really look okay on, like, a green shirt.
[843.67s -> 851.35s]  So black is the only available color here. The site says only available for three days.
[852.79s -> 857.45s]  Uh, that's, that's not, no way. That's not true. I don't know why it's saying that,
[857.45s -> 867.51s]  but I have it set to, I have it set to permanently be available. Only available for three days.
[867.51s -> 879.93s]  Now that's, I have like a storefront. Let me, let me just make sure. So they're printing
[881.03s -> 887.06s]  in three days. So what, how Teespring works is every three days orders get printed and
[887.06s -> 892.06s]  shipped out. So I don't know why it says available for three days, but that's just how
[892.06s -> 902.12s]  they print. So if you order your shirt today, you know, three days from now, all the ones that
[902.12s -> 906.98s]  were ordered in the last three days are going to print and then it'll start over again.
[908.04s -> 911.32s]  And it takes probably like a week or so, maybe a little bit more depending on where you live
[911.32s -> 916.84s]  to get there. But we'll see. Hopefully they turn out good. The last time I used Teespring,
[916.84s -> 921.19s]  the shirt came out good and I didn't change anything really. So let's hope that they look
[921.19s -> 927.30s]  as good and wear as good as the Glooman shirts did a few years ago. Anyways, uh,
[927.30s -> 935.27s]  we're going to move on. If you want to buy one, they're there. And, uh, we're going to move on
[935.27s -> 947.72s]  and play crazy taxi and move on to like Sega bass fishing and maybe a little bit of a jet
[947.72s -> 957.64s]  grind radio was the link to the store. If you just do, uh, exclamation point shirts,
[958.44s -> 961.64s]  it'll pop up. It's a Teespring storefront. You just kind of click on whatever you want.
[963.64s -> 969.08s]  Uh, I added, I can only make sure I said I added a cut. I added a, another cut for
[969.72s -> 975.78s]  the Glooman shirt. So there's like a women's tee. There's like a unisex tee. There's a couple of
[975.78s -> 982.82s]  them. I didn't do it yet for the night sky yet because I figured I'd just let just the t-shirt
[982.82s -> 991.10s]  be exist for what, like for now, I guess. Oh, this, the shirts have sold out and I'm like,
[991.10s -> 1000.76s]  God, make a dress. I can't do that. But anyways, thank you. It's been a long time coming.
[1002.38s -> 1007.18s]  Uh, I know a lot of people have been looking forward to that and so have I.
[1007.18s -> 1017.98s]  It's good that it's, uh, finally available. So let's start crazy taxi and, uh, kind of put
[1017.98s -> 1022.78s]  a cap on the Dreamcast stuff. Maybe not. I say that, but there's like still Shenmue
[1022.78s -> 1028.50s]  and like Shenmue. In my opinion, that's not Dreamcast stuff, though. Shenmue is not like
[1028.50s -> 1036.52s]  the Dreamcast stuff because, you know, it's not, it is Dreamcast, but it's not because
[1036.52s -> 1040.36s]  it's coming out on PC now. It's Shenmue 3 is coming out in like a few months or something.
[1040.36s -> 1051.35s]  Isn't it? Okay. Let me make sure this works. It does. I'm getting my controller.
[1053.82s -> 1058.62s]  Seaman. Yeah, I'm still, I know. And I still can play Seaman. I'm going to just load that
[1058.62s -> 1067.91s]  up one day for fun. You will see Seaman. I promise. I just kind of got fucked over
[1067.91s -> 1075.26s]  in the packaging. Somebody sent me the just disc and no microphone. So that sucked,
[1076.06s -> 1083.03s]  but let's go. Thank you for joining me. Joining me. I'm going to turn the lights on in here.
[1084.22s -> 1087.58s]  So crazy taxi is a game where you drive around in a taxi and it's fucking crazy.
[1088.54s -> 1103.37s]  Best description. I could probably get it. So how do you play this? You just drive people
[1103.37s -> 1117.37s]  around, right? They got arcade, original, uh, crazy box. What is crazy box? You can do arcade,
[1117.37s -> 1126.66s]  right? That makes the most sense. Arcade play by play, play by arcade rules. Work for three
[1126.66s -> 1134.38s]  minutes, work for five minutes. Just go arcade rules. The box, the box, the box. Let me just
[1134.38s -> 1143.35s]  remember how to play. Go ahead and pick a car and driver. All right. Let's see.
[1144.07s -> 1149.62s]  I'm going to be open shirt. Okay. Let's have some fun.
[1155.46s -> 1156.42s]  All right. So how do you drive?
[1159.99s -> 1168.70s]  Cable car stop top. It's probably kind of loud, but sorry. Whoa, the,
[1171.02s -> 1187.38s]  the analog, the analog is very sensitive. You know, it's also very loud. I'm in 99th place.
[1192.02s -> 1200.07s]  978 miles. Um, why did it reverse the controls? Um, right trigger. Why is it doing this?
[1200.95s -> 1210.70s]  I, what happened? Oh, right. Okay. I can, I have to set it. I have to set the gear.
[1213.58s -> 1239.86s]  Six bucks for the jump. I can't even fucking focus. All right. Get out. I can't drive on
[1239.86s -> 1252.81s]  the beach. Why? Hold on a minute. This is important. This shit is loud. I'm going to
[1252.81s -> 1270.78s]  turn the music up and the sounds down. This is hurting my brain. Let's go get in. I was
[1270.78s -> 1307.64s]  going to go very close, very close. Go get out. That was my practice. That was my practice.
[1312.15s -> 1315.83s]  692 bucks for two customers. Are you sure you don't want to register?
[1316.71s -> 1322.55s]  I don't want to register. No. Stop popping up every time I log into your website to ask
[1322.55s -> 1326.87s]  me if I want to register for updates. No, I don't want push notifications. I don't want you to
[1326.87s -> 1345.06s]  email me fucking flyers. No, I only do that again. Excellent. Now I'm ready to get this
[1345.06s -> 1349.86s]  going. Let's try to get like a thousand dollars at least. Yep. Same. I'm picking up
[1349.86s -> 1369.66s]  the same exact person that I picked up last time. Descent. Get out. Speedy. Speedy. All
[1369.66s -> 1377.58s]  right. All right. Go through the chain link fence. All right. This is big money right here.
[1378.76s -> 1390.44s]  Yacht harbors. This is 1.2 kilometers. All right. I got to get some air here.
[1391.08s -> 1411.19s]  250. Good tip. Four dollars. Good tip. Park. What are you guys doing? Just parking the
[1411.51s -> 1439.29s]  road. It's the same like SUV. Yo. Speedy. Who's next? Yellow. Get him. That was a pretty nice
[1439.29s -> 1464.42s]  maneuver. That's not a... Can we get out of the car? Whoa. What the fuck? Get out. Made it
[1464.42s -> 1475.64s]  over a thousand dollars, right? Good. PC Ford. Alexa. What? Can I pick up more than one
[1475.64s -> 1496.90s]  person? I forget. Excuse me. Excuse me. PC Ford. Yeah. Well, here's the thing, though,
[1496.90s -> 1504.15s]  guys. Right? This is available. Go. What the fuck are you doing? This is available on Dreamcast,
[1504.15s -> 1509.67s]  but the PC port was like six bucks or something, and the actual Dreamcast version
[1509.67s -> 1519.61s]  at lower resolution is, I believe, like at least 30 to 40 dollars. It's something like
[1519.61s -> 1531.00s]  that. Come on. Look at me. Look. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Over 1600. Come on. Last one. Come on.
[1533.13s -> 1545.77s]  Three, two, one. Get out. Ah, that's not gonna be bad. That's what I currently have.
[1551.77s -> 1564.12s]  Really? That wasn't good. I thought that was okay. No, what about original? play by
[1564.12s -> 1579.59s]  arcade rules in original. Let's do uh, I'm gonna try every person. Fuck off, I want the big money.
[1580.47s -> 1603.10s]  This is a $400 affair. $1.50. $2.00. $4.00. Ooh, near miss. A head-on crash got me 50 cents.
[1613.00s -> 1624.15s]  Get out! Watch out, out, out, out, out, out, out. All right, I gotta turn him around, right?
[1627.43s -> 1643.82s]  I'm thinking, I'm thinking of going down. Down or is it? I think it is this way. I was
[1643.82s -> 1650.78s]  thinking I could go up a few jumps to make some more money. Actually, it kind of worked.
[1652.22s -> 1678.30s]  I thought I could go off like a jump going down. Apparently not. There's too many sounds. There
[1678.30s -> 1688.34s]  are a lot of sounds, you're right. I need two grand. I just don't get in car accidents. I say
[1688.34s -> 1698.04s]  you get more tips. Like that. Oh, that would have been... What is under the car? What's
[1698.04s -> 1702.22s]  going on? Why am I popping up and down like this? What's wrong with my car?
[1703.02s -> 1741.10s]  Fuck you. Right here. All right, I got more than I had last time. This is a quick one. Near crash.
[1741.82s -> 1745.24s]  There it is. Gotta drive on the wrong side of the road to make this money.
[1750.12s -> 1767.06s]  Nice. That wasn't bad. I immediately picked one up. Okay, good. Turn around. Same deal.
[1768.02s -> 1779.96s]  Oncoming traffic. Weave. Ooh! Ooh! Oh, don't ever tell me I've never fucking played this
[1779.96s -> 1789.22s]  game before because I haven't. I did like once. There we go. I better get like a class
[1789.22s -> 1804.98s]  B license for this. All right, I need something. Come on, get in there. Landing here. I'm gonna
[1804.98s -> 1815.26s]  say bang of right. No, left. We park. Oh, look at this jump. Come on. Do I have enough
[1815.26s -> 1828.42s]  strength? Apparently. Apparently. All right, we're still fine. Everything's just good.
[1828.42s -> 1832.58s]  We're just... We got hit by a fucking train. I don't think this is the way to play through
[1832.58s -> 1865.61s]  that. Oh! That wasn't bad. God damn it. This game's too addicting. I might as well do
[1865.61s -> 1873.93s]  AAA. Is it too loud? Should I turn it down? Or is it just good enough? Original. I can
[1873.93s -> 1886.74s]  do this. Play off by arcade rules. Good. All right, let's do, uh, China. What was
[1886.74s -> 1895.24s]  it? 2600 was my best one? I need to get like over three grand. Clean. Let's go.
[1896.20s -> 1931.18s]  Stop. Ah! That was a lot of tips though. That was so many dips. That was so many dips.
[1933.82s -> 1943.72s]  All right, let's pull this one back. North camp station. Come on, Gina. What the
[1943.72s -> 1947.88s]  hell was that? I got plenty of time. Don't worry. I'm gonna get a class B license.
[1947.88s -> 1963.80s]  I'm gonna clean this up. We're gonna get it. Over the hill. Nice. Nice. Come on,
[1963.88s -> 1982.50s]  I need some more of that. Nice. Come on. More tips. Oh! It's right there. Go through. Go
[1982.50s -> 2009.67s]  through. No! Beat the train! At least it's not gonna be very good. Class E gamer. I'm
[2009.67s -> 2021.77s]  gonna get at least class B before I change to a different game. Watch this one. Holy shit,
[2021.77s -> 2033.16s]  Germ. I didn't think you could do that. Yeah. Dude, I played this game all day,
[2033.80s -> 2037.88s]  years ago, and I still play it. And I didn't even know that was a possible jump scenario.
[2040.46s -> 2077.54s]  Get in. In. Straight away. It's not straight away. It was that way. Oh! I got it! Anybody in
[2077.54s -> 2091.85s]  here? Is that somebody? This game's fucking fun. Still. That was not even good. I can do
[2091.85s -> 2111.66s]  better than that. Whoa. Don't crash on me. Don't crash on me. Class C streamer. Don't
[2111.66s -> 2119.00s]  worry. I'm not allowed. All right. So who did I like the most? Probably Beedie. I think I made
[2119.00s -> 2137.45s]  the most money with Beedie. Go expensive first. Wave Beach. I want at least $200 in tips.
[2138.25s -> 2155.94s]  Count it. That's not a tip? How? You really threw me off with that no tip, dude.
[2163.29s -> 2182.60s]  Air. Come on. Air. I need air. I did actually turn. How did I go the wrong way?
[2183.56s -> 2186.41s]  Are you serious? No. Do it again.
[2189.53s -> 2202.78s]  I thought I had the... I thought I cut it the right direction. What the fuck was the arrow doing?
[2202.78s -> 2225.35s]  What the hell was that? Come on, man. Jump to car. Good. Ten bucks. Come on. More. More tips.
[2226.07s -> 2238.25s]  That was the best I possibly could have done that. Right here. Pizza parlor. This is far
[2238.25s -> 2257.50s]  away. Drive. Nice. Good cut. Good cut. You've got a cut than that. Like that one. That was
[2257.50s -> 2277.86s]  still a pretty good cut. Right here. Got another person immediately. Big bits. $50.
[2278.74s -> 2284.28s]  Holy shit. Miniclips. Thanks for the 50 bucks. They say slow. Wait, wait, wait. Hey,
[2284.28s -> 2288.74s]  Jerma, keep up the good work and never stop being speedy. Thank you, Miniclips. Thank you
[2288.74s -> 2296.65s]  for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. It means a lot. Thank you so much. I'm going to be fast.
[2297.21s -> 2308.95s]  It's a shitload of money. All right, Miniclips. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta make at least $50 in tips.
[2313.43s -> 2329.66s]  Oh fuck. It's too ridiculous. Jesus. All right. I didn't make $50 in tips. It's okay. Anybody
[2329.66s -> 2342.06s]  around here that I can pick up? I need them right now. You. The Millennium Tower. I need
[2342.06s -> 2361.08s]  to make three grand at least. But I need to jump. Any jumps around here? Shit! It's all
[2361.08s -> 2369.26s]  right. It's okay. Just build up tips. Cut it. Okay. We're good. It's the Millennium Tower
[2369.26s -> 2388.57s]  right here. Let's go. Get in. Okay. This is going to take us out. Where the hell am I? How do
[2388.57s -> 2396.54s]  I get out of here? What was the last? The highest I've ever had was 26. I did the same
[2396.54s -> 2411.37s]  thing last time. Oh fuck. I made it. Okay. I need another fair. Where? There! This way.
[2412.01s -> 2429.96s]  All right. Grand Mercury Hotel. Don't do this to me, game. Come on. Get out of my fucking
[2429.96s -> 2451.86s]  way. Too many cars. Holy shit. Got it. Somebody else? Is there any other fair? Go! Yes!
[2456.38s -> 2465.80s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry. Back to the Millennium Tower. That guy just crashed into me. What a dick.
[2466.52s -> 2493.88s]  Millennium Tower. No. Oh fuck. No.
[2502.10s -> 2530.17s]  Crazy box. Crazy box. Jump past the K point. Stunt challenge mode.
[2542.23s -> 2545.83s]  How do you do this without? What did I do wrong?
[2546.63s -> 2553.43s]  Is there like a super mode?
[2566.50s -> 2574.34s]  There's a speed boost. How do you do that? Pushing in the sticks.
[2576.38s -> 2580.78s]  X, Y. That's the horn. That's going. That's reverse. That's.
[2585.86s -> 2594.65s]  Press the gas right when you shift. Okay. There we go. That would save so much time if I did
[2594.65s -> 2608.58s]  that in any of the actual game. That would save so much time. Okay. Cool. So that's. You have to
[2608.58s -> 2614.34s]  be in reverse and then go into gas. Go into front. Perform crazy drifts to earn a minimum 15 combo
[2614.34s -> 2619.62s]  within the time limit. Crazy. So we're learning. We're learning the ropes here. How do you do
[2619.62s -> 2628.02s]  a crazy drift? Just hold on the brake? Is there like another combination of buttons I don't know
[2628.02s -> 2650.12s]  how to do here? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. How am I doing that? This is so many more
[2650.20s -> 2661.75s]  ways to get tips that I wasn't doing. How did I just do that? I think it's hold. Okay. So
[2661.75s -> 2666.07s]  it looks like you go into reverse and then immediately into drive while you're turning.
[2667.19s -> 2676.74s]  No. No. So you hit both of them at the same time. Okay. So you have to do
[2677.46s -> 2685.38s]  reverse and drive at the same time. That's how you do it. All right. So I'll get it this time.
[2685.38s -> 2695.43s]  Press start. What do you mean? Like options? Like controls?
[2698.17s -> 2709.51s]  That doesn't. Brake horn. Confirm destination. Gear. Drive. Reverse. Yeah. So. I just got baited.
[2710.15s -> 2712.95s]  All right. Sorry. I got it. I figured it out. All right. We need.
[2714.31s -> 2740.81s]  So I need to get a 15 combo. Shouldn't be too hard. Press start. That was apparently too hard.
[2742.42s -> 2750.55s]  Let's give it another go. Ready? Try it again. I think. Let me go faster. Let me see. How long
[2750.55s -> 2756.82s]  can I hold it for? Can I like go across the hole? Can I just drift across the whole thing?
[2757.62s -> 2762.38s]  I guess it's like five or six that you can actually add it up to.
[2771.66s -> 2778.14s]  You can actually control it. Yeah, you can control it while you're turning.
[2785.75s -> 2788.23s]  Take all the customers to their destination within the time limit.
[2789.03s -> 2800.73s]  Let's go. 109 seconds. Advice is the start button.
[2801.69s -> 2819.34s]  You're talking about like at the menu. Not like in game. Why did I just lose time?
[2830.07s -> 2856.84s]  What? Oh, you're over here this time. Okay. I gotta get used to that.
[2858.36s -> 2865.54s]  It's weird to hit that brake like that. Have to hit both buttons at the same time.
[2866.50s -> 2871.77s]  I'm gonna have you. It's A and B together to do that. It's kind of awkward.
[2892.36s -> 2900.30s]  What the fuck? Why? 56 seconds. Am I insane? Did that just say 109 seconds?
[2909.74s -> 2919.69s]  Oh, it was a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. All right. I mean that's click.
[2919.69s -> 2923.93s]  Why not just say 60? So that's one minute and nine seconds.
[2931.99s -> 2950.71s]  Count up. 590. Well, I mean it doesn't say why in all three numbers the first one should be large
[2950.71s -> 2964.84s]  and the second two should be small. God damn it. I'm trying to. Why do I go faster when you
[2964.84s -> 2985.66s]  do a brake? E-brake like that. You like drift and go so fast. Welcome to crazy taxi.
[2985.66s -> 2995.22s]  I'm just gonna brake normally. I could get it if I did. I'm gonna do it again. Let's do it again.
[2996.18s -> 3017.99s]  It's time to get it. Go, go, go. What the fuck? Oh, why?
[3023.00s -> 3033.26s]  You have to. That's annoying. It is. All right. So let me explain something here. You have to
[3033.26s -> 3038.46s]  press reverse and drive at the same time. So when you do that, when you take your finger
[3038.46s -> 3060.82s]  off, sometimes you're just in reverse. He's making excuses. You can call whatever you want.
[3061.70s -> 3066.71s]  I'm just trying to get that down because it's hard to do that.
[3085.03s -> 3112.62s]  Oh my god. You have to start that drift to turn around in the middle of the road like 150 feet
[3112.62s -> 3135.66s]  away at least. Let me try that. I'm not even gonna do it. Just do it. Just like drop them off
[3136.38s -> 3195.16s]  because you got to complete stop. Turn. Shit. No, I'm not gonna get it. Doing it in the wrong
[3195.16s -> 3207.26s]  order. It's fucking crazy. That's ridiculous. How do you control that? That's insane. Wrong order?
[3209.46s -> 3221.72s]  Like aren't they the same distance away from each other? All right, isn't it all the same
[3221.72s -> 3243.19s]  distance? Oh my lord. Wrong order of missions. Let me try something. That's fucking crazy. Oh
[3243.19s -> 3276.49s]  my god. How would you ever time that correctly? Get me out of here. Wait, hold on. So you
[3276.49s -> 3285.32s]  tell me that I have to do this like Demon's Souls wise? If 3-1 is harder than 1-2. 3-1 is
[3285.32s -> 3297.50s]  harder than like 2-2. Oh, I thought this was just kind of... all right. So I like wasn't supposed
[3297.50s -> 3310.44s]  to do 3-1 until I knew how to do the other things. It goes down like this. I thought it
[3310.44s -> 3332.14s]  was 1-1-2. All right, can't you just call it 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9? What the hell was it supposed to do here?
[3333.02s -> 3345.94s]  Run over the flag behind the car within the time limit to execute it. So shift into reverse,
[3345.94s -> 3358.58s]  shift into drive to do a crazy drift. There's a flag behind me. Okay, so...
[3360.18s -> 3370.98s]  Okay, what? I didn't even need to... no, that was... you want me to drift and then...
[3370.98s -> 3394.50s]  I thought there was like a flag behind... All right, I got it. Why does it want me to do the
[3394.50s -> 3399.72s]  crazy drift here? Pop all the balloons within the... okay, pop the balloons.
[3401.08s -> 3410.18s]  You have to get a crazy dash right after a crazy drift. Crazy dash is... let off the...
[3410.18s -> 3427.86s]  let off the accelerator, shift into D, press the accelerator. Let's see. Oh boy, that's hard to
[3427.86s -> 3433.32s]  do that. What if I'm already... okay, hold on. What if I'm already in reverse... if I'm
[3433.32s -> 3445.64s]  already in drive? That's so confusing. So if you're in reverse, you have to be in reverse.
[3445.72s -> 3457.83s]  Totally learn how to do that. You're doing a drift, shift into drive, and then do...
[3459.59s -> 3476.57s]  accelerate. But what if I'm not in? That makes no sense to me. So hold on. A crazy dash
[3476.57s -> 3480.49s]  is you let off the accelerator and then you have to shift into drive and then press the
[3480.49s -> 3486.10s]  accelerator, right? To do a... to do a... no, god damn it. I want to look at the...
[3487.62s -> 3503.83s]  You have to shift into reversed and then shift into drive. So but you then... but you
[3503.83s -> 3533.18s]  have to shift. So is it just like a practice arena? So hold on. Just set up a macro. That seems
[3533.74s -> 3547.61s]  really hard to do, reliably. Shift back into drive after shifting from reverse to drive.
[3548.49s -> 3568.39s]  Let off the accelerator. Well, shift into reverse, drive, shift into drive. Okay, well,
[3568.39s -> 3581.54s]  I'm just gonna play. I'm just gonna try to do it. What is 2-2? Time limit. You gotta go
[3581.54s -> 3588.71s]  into reverse, turn, and then drive. Well, let me just try to do this with my new techniques
[3588.71s -> 3609.88s]  that I've learned. All right, that's good. Even that alone is gonna help. No, it's not.
[3617.18s -> 3623.19s]  Oh my god! That's not helping at all, actually. The drift just makes you go crazy.
[3631.82s -> 3675.06s]  Jesus! I'm just like killing people. Oh, A, B. Oh, that's annoying. Okay, I'm gonna
[3675.06s -> 3689.53s]  try for drift. The drift uphill. What a great idea. I mean, that was kind of cool. That should be.
[3689.53s -> 3707.58s]  Nope, but I'm in reverse. What the fuck is happening? I've done like exponentially worse
[3707.58s -> 3713.29s]  since involving the like advanced techniques. So now I'm in reverse. I don't like that
[3713.29s -> 3726.92s]  mechanic. The handbrake should not be reversed. It's completed! Only two dollars
[3726.92s -> 3743.30s]  can be driving into a train in the last second pulling away. Holy fuck, that was 20 dollars.
[3744.10s -> 3745.80s]  Hold on, I'm gonna try it again.
[3760.44s -> 3766.70s]  Somebody mentioned, it probably would be insane to see somebody do like a super expert,
[3766.70s -> 3779.85s]  like 3,000 hours in crazy taxi gameplay. That would be pretty insane. I'm only gonna
[3779.85s -> 3786.74s]  use the drift. I'm only gonna use those techniques when I need them. For instance,
[3786.74s -> 3792.76s]  right there and then be in reverse. I thought those were just tables, like
[3792.76s -> 3812.02s]  technique tables on the street. I can't go in that way. This is all wrong.
[3818.82s -> 3860.82s]  Really? Let's go. There it is! Come on, get out! 17 bucks! Lot of money, let's go!
[3881.59s -> 3885.77s]  That would have been clean if that asshole wasn't in the way. How many cars to do this?
[3889.38s -> 3925.72s]  Undrift, too many cars. No! Goddamn drift acceleration! Sorry. God, please.
[3932.44s -> 3970.30s]  Turn, turn around! Go for that jump. Get out of my way. It's right here. I need somebody right
[3970.30s -> 3982.79s]  now. Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, anybody, anyone, anyone, you! Get in! Why?
[3983.59s -> 3987.59s]  That's so hard to fucking do that reliably. Like, actually win a game without sitting there.
[4011.00s -> 4014.81s]  Jesus Christ. We're gonna see again.
[4024.42s -> 4032.62s]  I'll give it a few more attempts before we move on, because we got a lot of other shit to do.
[4033.58s -> 4046.09s]  He got worse after he trained. Yeah, because the techniques you have to do are actually
[4046.09s -> 4057.26s]  fairly difficult to pull off in a game scenario. Like, those drifts, you get tips,
[4057.26s -> 4063.88s]  but you don't complete. You're like, holy fuck, that was a lot of money, but like,
[4063.88s -> 4099.85s]  I screwed myself up. I lost like four seconds. Where'd it go? What? Okay, what the fuck is this?
[4105.83s -> 4117.86s]  No! Hello? What the fuck is happening? What? Oh my fucking, give me a break. Really?
[4125.85s -> 4134.95s]  That was annoying. Let's drop Xbox. He just decided to turn down, he just turned the
[4134.95s -> 4145.18s]  control off. That was great. That was really fun. Imagine if I was like at Gwyn in Dark Souls
[4145.18s -> 4177.10s]  when that happens. Get out! Get it! I'm gonna go, it's the same person that, where the fuck do
[4177.10s -> 4197.78s]  you want me to take you? Every way is the wrong way. Well, this is the right way. Get out!
[4197.78s -> 4229.83s]  I'm going, not bad. All right, I gotta just focus on the next couple and just actually
[4229.83s -> 4250.52s]  deliver people. Any time. I'm not doing, I'm not delivering nearly as many people
[4250.52s -> 4267.46s]  as I was before. That's like half. I don't get it. Let's see if I can get this delivered.
[4268.26s -> 4290.39s]  I don't know, unless it's somebody right here. A class D license!
[4298.81s -> 4312.46s]  This isn't the right soundtrack. All right, last try. Last try to get above C.
[4313.42s -> 4337.00s]  Last attempt. It's clean. Only drip when I need to. I mean, that, not right there. It's okay.
[4337.88s -> 4386.49s]  Get out of my car! Get out of my fucking car! Lots of fucking time now. Hit the jump, come on.
[4387.13s -> 4398.63s]  Christ. Where the fuck am I going? What the hell? This is far away.
[4399.59s -> 4436.15s]  You use car shop. What the fuck? What the hell? No! The fucking arrow just like freaked out.
[4436.87s -> 4445.06s]  Oh god damn it. What? I'm not going to make this jump. What the hell was that?
[4445.94s -> 4475.21s]  I still, it's okay. Just get, I can build time. Somebody right there. Get out. Whatever,
[4475.21s -> 4493.91s]  doesn't matter. Trying to pull off something there, but I couldn't. All right, just drive. Get
[4493.91s -> 4527.00s]  there. I fucking lowered that arrow. Just point over here. I gotta get it. This game is so hard.
[4527.72s -> 4534.81s]  It's so addicting, but it's so difficult. I can't imagine what a perfect gameplay of
[4534.81s -> 4540.95s]  this looks like. Holy shit, it's probably amazing. All right, one more time. Last try
[4540.95s -> 4562.94s]  to do this. I'm gonna go with you first. You've ruined it. Retry. Last try. Last retry.
[4562.94s -> 4566.54s]  One more retry after this if I fuck it up. One more retry after that. One more retry after this.
[4566.54s -> 4580.06s]  One final retry after the last retry. You understand? Go. All right, no fun, no funny
[4580.06s -> 4587.46s]  business. Just try to get above a C. I can do it. That's even a little bit funny business
[4587.46s -> 4607.78s]  there. It's good. It's okay. Fuck! Don't freak out. Easy. Okay, that's one retry.
[4608.66s -> 4633.16s]  That's a, that was a good start. Don't blow it. Good start. Very good.
[4634.87s -> 4648.22s]  Exceptional quality. My controller just ripped. I just got possessed. I didn't do that.
[4648.78s -> 4665.98s]  I'm gonna use car shop. I know what that is. It's literally right here.
[4669.94s -> 4688.30s]  Easiest one I've done all day. Get it. Big Hills Park. All right, get some money. Stupid
[4688.30s -> 4697.66s]  fucking Winnipeg. I'll get out of my way. No drifting. Just good driving. That still
[4697.66s -> 4724.76s]  qualifies as good driving. Still qualifies as good driving. Get in the car, dummy. Nice.
[4724.76s -> 4732.55s]  Just thread the needle. Just go, just go, go, go. Keep going down this way. You can

[7645.13s -> 7653.56s]  a little box that's floating in the middle of my screen i'm not sure i'm going to be able to load
[7654.20s -> 7669.59s]  a game let me see hold on no i guess i guess we're okay that's crazy taxi it's oh awesome
[7669.59s -> 7679.77s]  the game's a blast and now we're going to move on to space channel five somehow this is space
[7679.77s -> 7694.02s]  channel five uh part two let me just uh make sure it is correctly now that's 12 it's 1280

[7710.84s -> 7719.13s]  change this part two is very hard that's all right just see how long it takes me to fucking

[7724.18s -> 7730.31s]  that's like the older like 30 plus youtuber streamer that just is like this guy i'm not
[7730.31s -> 7737.46s]  good at this i don't like this i don't like this game i'm not sure is that happening in
[7737.46s -> 7750.70s]  real time here i'm gonna work on that i don't want to be i don't want to turn into like the
[7750.70s -> 7757.56s]  old boomer mutant guy i don't want to do that all right let me this is not capturing for
[7757.56s -> 7768.82s]  some reason this is very soft settings let me just stereo vibration off lyrics on screen mode
[7768.82s -> 7780.86s]  widescreen why is this so low this is very quiet i can't change the settings in here hold on
[7783.14s -> 7794.71s]  really i can't put the settings in hold on options play game there's no that's annoying
[7795.27s -> 7802.44s]  well at least let you see what i'm looking at uh i'm gonna have to reload the game and
[7802.44s -> 7811.94s]  put the audio up because there doesn't seem to be an option here there's like settings
[7811.94s -> 7817.38s]  but that doesn't sound stereo there's no volume slider the volume slider already hold on
[7817.38s -> 7832.26s]  i'm gonna do this hopefully this works otherwise i'm not sure what the fix it for that is so this
[7832.26s -> 7841.19s]  is a hard game isn't this like parapa the rapa audio sound effects that's not that low
[7843.85s -> 7863.51s]  that's normal see if that does anything presented by sega uh okay come on now it's very loud

[8135.56s -> 8146.46s]  so this is wait this is this is the sub this is not the dub is this gonna be in japanese
[8155.64s -> 8175.30s]  i think this might be in japanese report number one view rating it's just supposed to be invisible
[8184.20s -> 8185.48s]  yeah see this must be invisible
[8191.02s -> 8194.06s]  bad guys unknown dance troop where are the assets
[8201.48s -> 8210.33s]  if hearts run out rescue fails how am i supposed to do this without steam
[8220.82s -> 8248.49s]  what was it what the fuck okay can you not do that please is this supposed to look like this
[8250.10s -> 8252.90s]  i thought this was just hyper stylized it's not supposed to look like this
[8253.78s -> 8272.31s]  oh i thought this is like a cool stylistic okay well that's unfortunate let me just redo it
[8272.87s -> 8278.70s]  let me go to the configuration to make sure i didn't activate something weird you know this
[8279.66s -> 8291.74s]  it's just the graphics adapter no there's nothing abnormal here you can't you don't
[8291.74s -> 8300.34s]  understand japanese you can't see the assets this looks normal why would that's weird why
[8300.34s -> 8327.32s]  would some of the assets just not work uh should i like verify the game cache okay i'm
[8327.32s -> 8341.11s]  gonna verify integrity of game files because you're missing part one of the game the menu
[8341.11s -> 8344.39s]  is supposed to look like that all files successfully validated i think i'm just
[8344.39s -> 8353.14s]  it's just not rendering somehow turning off vsync works i just turned it off maybe i'll
[8353.14s -> 8357.78s]  check i'll choose like a different adapter maybe i'll choose like nvidia gtx number one or two
[8357.78s -> 8363.43s]  let's just try one because i don't know why there's three adapters here when i have one
[8364.47s -> 8369.93s]  let me try like 12 1920 by 1080 at 60 hertz maybe that are trying to do anything else
[8369.93s -> 8380.73s]  let's just try 60 hertz all right v sync is off everything's off see if it does it
[8380.73s -> 8388.78s]  on this adapter is this this yeah this is the steam version of this game hey one of the shirts
[8388.78s -> 8396.86s]  gonna be available they are available right now um i okay so i figured out this is putting it on
[8396.86s -> 8403.05s]  a different monitor but that's not gonna help that's just what that means zero one and two
[8403.05s -> 8415.05s]  okay i don't think this is gonna do anything oh it's still fucked up well uh that was space
[8415.05s -> 8421.90s]  channel five part two for some reason that i don't unless there's uh turn down the
[8421.90s -> 8436.94s]  resolution i will try doing that i'm gonna turn off uh fxaa the resolution is now at
[8436.94s -> 8449.43s]  let's just do i don't know 14 1600 by 900 see what that does the menu is supposed to
[8449.43s -> 8456.17s]  look like that oh well why does everybody tell me it wasn't the menu is supposed to
[8456.17s -> 8469.99s]  look like that uh a bunch of people told me that was let's try it again i dropped
[8469.99s -> 8477.91s]  the resolution turned off v sync i will fix this if it works okay i can just fix it right now who
[8477.91s -> 8505.35s]  cares uh hello did it work come on uh don't think of it hell so you're telling me that
[8505.35s -> 8509.27s]  the reason why i didn't buy space channel five on the dreamcast is because i know that they
[8509.27s -> 8523.75s]  ported it to pc and the port doesn't work well uh we'll maybe try that again later
[8524.55s -> 8527.43s]  but for the purposes i'm gonna move on to a different one maybe i'll
[8528.23s -> 8529.27s]  we'll come back and try it again
[8531.59s -> 8540.44s]  unfortunately that's just kind of how it is turn v-sync is off everything is off all right
[8540.44s -> 8545.75s]  let's do uh move on from that one that's too bad i wanted to play that for a while too
[8546.90s -> 8555.21s]  so we have uh we have knights what else is in the collection knights is in here sonic
[8555.29s -> 8564.18s]  adventure like dx whatever the hell that is sonic adventure dx this one i was told
[8564.18s -> 8570.09s]  to play the dreamcast one jet set radio sega bass fishing let's do sega bass fishing
[8570.81s -> 8582.17s]  we got all night guys don't worry hopefully that doesn't happen to more than one of these that
[8582.17s -> 8597.91s]  would be kind of sad because you know that would be really unfortunate if percentage wise
[8597.91s -> 8602.39s]  700 000 games had more working titles than the dreamcast collection on windows
[8602.39s -> 8617.10s]  that would be very very sad all right oh we're good with audio let's go i'm trying what do
[8617.10s -> 8634.66s]  you i what do you think i'm doing okay here's this see if it works do we have we have assets
[8634.66s -> 8647.42s]  oh that's vega that's uh the screen looks a little weird so let's fix that good sega
[8647.42s -> 8653.61s]  this is sega bass fishing this is the original best fishing game ever made

[11044.57s -> 11049.77s]  test flights alphonse and edward this thing's got unlimited power you know so i figured why
[11049.77s -> 11057.85s]  not use it to power my plane supercharge you gotta come over to my workshop sonic
[11057.85s -> 11064.57s]  i got something i've got that's not a toy it's in the mystic ruins the fastest way is by train

[11131.05s -> 11156.58s]  mystic ruins will be departing soon okay the train that goes into the casino what an awful
[11156.58s -> 11167.93s]  camera i mean i can't really think of a worse camera than this game tails workshop should be
[11168.01s -> 11169.13s]  around here somewhere
[11181.08s -> 11186.22s]  if it isn't sonic he's not wearing clothes i just realized that it's a giant talking egg
[11187.26s -> 11192.78s]  i thought sonic got shorts on the pants the greatest scientific genius in the world
[11194.38s -> 11199.50s]  whatever you say egg man actually running around naked 150 miles per hour
[11199.82s -> 11205.26s]  now i'm gonna put them to work you're always up to no good now what do you want
[11205.82s -> 11214.14s]  i want all of the chaos emeralds better not interfere or else or else what you big loser
[11215.58s -> 11232.73s]  or else i'll take them from you by force the hard way three times what about eggman
[11232.73s -> 11238.65s]  that's really weird he always uses this same ship every game he makes another one
[11238.73s -> 11247.19s]  oh eggman can you just make something else that's not the little circle spaceship thing
[11247.19s -> 11270.73s]  that i hit three times it worked i think i have to jump on the i'm assuming homing dash
[11270.73s -> 11283.80s]  on the missiles would be what i would do whole systems full power run real fast
[11284.28s -> 11294.63s]  yeah land on top whole systems full power
[11296.47s -> 11298.47s]  he's not gonna get away with this
[11312.09s -> 11319.82s]  this is kind of making me sick i'm sorry it is whole systems full power no you hit me three
[11319.82s -> 11328.38s]  times no i actually hit the sector motor takes to kill me hey i'll play with you some other
[11329.34s -> 11339.72s]  who's the engineer making these like you gotta have a conversation with whoever is on your dev
[11339.72s -> 11346.49s]  team and can we have a device that's not going to take three bumps and explode it has to be
[11346.49s -> 11349.61s]  away i don't know what you're using for materials but it has to be something well that
[11349.61s -> 11369.93s]  wasn't so hard nice job tail you brought that out there chaos why are you still holding
[11369.93s -> 11377.78s]  that you can't you're delivering that to oh no isn't that the same monster i saw the other day
[11386.39s -> 11390.55s]  oh yes it's just as the stone tablets predicted
[11393.67s -> 11399.94s]  this is the original infinity increases every time i feed him a chaos emerald that's really
[11399.94s -> 11404.82s]  true with all seven emeralds in him he'll be invincible and work for me
[11405.78s -> 11412.50s]  together dragon ball the original infinity stones though it's ruined i'll build robotnik
[11412.50s -> 11417.70s]  yeah no sonica hedgehog is just a wreck where i will rule it all dragon ball isn't that what
[11417.70s -> 11423.06s]  bonus let's find another emerald shall we isn't that what they did they made their own version
[11423.06s -> 11430.63s]  of dragon ball because they love dragon ball so much that's what he said right sonic you
[11430.63s -> 11440.31s]  can't let him get away with this can we no way tails so it's up to us to get the emeralds
[11440.31s -> 11446.57s]  before eggman does huh that's why he goes super saiyan he turns into like yellow hair
[11446.57s -> 11462.86s]  supersonic well you think they just made that up i mean yeah that is a perfect copy
[11463.42s -> 11482.25s]  a nice neva nice nevada theory i almost fucked it up i almost said it wrong can i go
[11482.81s -> 11506.02s]  here tails workshop nothing fun can be done in there i wasn't supposed to go that way okay

[11782.30s -> 11788.06s]  time on panel number one it will take you to panels two and three jump as soon as you
[11788.06s -> 11808.02s]  land on a panel or else you'll fall two more good wild all right where do i go from here

[11938.63s -> 11945.19s]  yeah i mean i think came out like 20 years ago it's hard to hate something that came out
[11945.19s -> 11949.75s]  this long ago even though maybe it's a little i don't know i can't i don't really have an
[11949.75s -> 11977.90s]  opinion i need to go to station square you may find something oh casino time i mean don't
[11977.90s -> 11981.42s]  worry right now i'm saying yeah this is kind of cool it's fun it's old but it's interesting
[11981.42s -> 11984.46s]  and like don't worry give it like another 30 minutes i'm gonna tell you how this is the worst
[11984.46s -> 11989.58s]  game i've ever played there's a place somewhere in the city where you can go down into the sewer
[11990.38s -> 12000.22s]  just give it like 30 you'll hear me all right this twinkle park no casino is over here

[12114.06s -> 12119.50s]  light speed press and hold the action button to store up power once you have enough power
[12119.50s -> 12123.98s]  release the button and you can do the light speed dash oh cool the light speed dash lets
[12123.98s -> 12128.70s]  you race toward rings at light speed as long as there's a trail of rings you can go just
[12128.70s -> 12140.73s]  about anyway you know that's all the thing i was just trying to do use the light dash
[12140.73s -> 12145.85s]  to run along the paths of rings hold the action button and let go when you have enough
[12145.85s -> 12154.97s]  power okay do i have enough power you have to actually hold it for a while
[12155.69s -> 12178.07s]  and now i can go back and go in that room egg what do i mean egg what i can pick i can pick
[12178.07s -> 12197.85s]  that up who the hell was that how did i get in that where was that room where was that

[12293.06s -> 12310.65s]  slot machine there's the poker table they have one casino ten casino casino casino
[12310.65s -> 12323.35s]  casinopolis is open so the only way in is the no it's a level right the music is way
[12323.35s -> 12334.01s]  too loud i wish there's no solution okay there's no casino open so i'm gonna go
[12334.01s -> 12345.50s]  into that room and dash across let me go back doesn't press the button press the button
[12346.38s -> 12363.08s]  i thought that they said i can't go in the front door all right this camera is seriously
[12363.08s -> 12379.77s]  starting to piss me off i can't even turn the fucking thing around all right let's go
[12390.39s -> 12399.75s]  i like this level slot pinball for us ahead these l1 and r1 remove the flipper and match
[12399.75s -> 12406.76s]  three pictures in a row and shoot the ball towards the arrow if it's dumped in the garage
[12406.76s -> 12421.62s]  you don't have a hundred rings shit i don't have any money pause it your rings i can't activate
[12421.62s -> 12433.02s]  any of these i guess okay all right well hold on if it's that well i can't blame sega for
[12433.02s -> 12439.98s]  having a 5000 decibel game that they didn't fix and it doesn't matter i just turned down
[12439.98s -> 12449.83s]  my audio on windows like my desktop windows audio to 15 listen to this listen to this shit
[12450.89s -> 12464.49s]  let's open up sonic all right i have to drop it in three different places now
[12464.49s -> 12482.06s]  because now i can't hear anything how's that turn the sound down in the game options well
[12482.06s -> 12485.66s]  the funny thing about that is i have to exit the game and restart the game to do that i did
[12485.66s -> 12490.22s]  three times pretty much already so i really don't want to exit the game to turn the sound
[12490.30s -> 12506.78s]  down all right so what do i go from here cards is card pinball so i can't do any of this
[12507.74s -> 12513.85s]  you missed three times however you have less than 100 rings you get dumped in the garage
[12517.75s -> 12522.49s]  so i don't know i'm just gonna get dumped in the garage this is like a stack of money
[12522.49s -> 12542.92s]  somewhere shower room well i'm robbing the casino apparently i'm just punching machines
[12543.64s -> 12588.84s]  that's not okay wash yourself up anymore there's not you know it's not the video game that's going
[12588.84s -> 12595.90s]  to make me turn this game off it's a camera i don't mind the game i just would love to see
[12595.90s -> 12624.87s]  it at the angle that i want to see that okay so what are you telling me i can just do this
[12625.59s -> 12633.99s]  you just go in i thought if you have less than 100 rings you just get dumped in the
[12633.99s -> 12649.40s]  garage don't have to use money to make money i'll just get free money what kind of
[12649.40s -> 12655.10s]  casino is this is he gonna play for free where are the stakes i can't play like this

[12776.81s -> 12782.49s]  like sonic pinball you're a little too the ball's a little too slow this is very easy
[12783.53s -> 12802.57s]  all right the bonus again i kind of don't want to see it though again resident sleeper again
[12802.57s -> 12822.25s]  oh i no don't do it again anything else give me a different bonus please stop this

[14012.57s -> 14038.42s]  how it works what happened to you all right i'm out there are other gardens all right so uh the
[14038.42s -> 14046.06s]  train station right i i go back where's that train i don't even know i ran like by like
[14046.06s -> 14069.19s]  three times i think get in what the hell okay so what is this
[14075.30s -> 14079.38s]  this is the crystal ring what do i get to do this reduces the time needed to store power
[14079.38s -> 14087.34s]  for the light speed dash nice so let's see how let's see what the timer is i can move
[14087.34s -> 14096.73s]  around with this on what does that activate is that just the door there's no other cool thing
[14096.73s -> 14107.42s]  to do there is he gonna play through the whole game uh no i don't think so we have a couple
[14107.42s -> 14112.94s]  other things to get through that i'd want to play this game's fun though it's not it's not a bad
[14112.94s -> 14118.73s]  game all right uh i have to go back to the casino alley to get the key even though because
[14118.73s -> 14133.98s]  i went into the dumb garden play the whole thing do you guys really want that don't play
[14133.98s -> 14147.21s]  the stupid idiot blue rat game i'm not gonna play the whole thing don't worry i just need
[14147.21s -> 14153.88s]  to know where the elevator is no not the elevator the train do i have to go out here
[14155.59s -> 14180.06s]  up where is the train it's up the stairs no not that way not that way but not that towards the
[14180.06s -> 14196.71s]  casino in the chow garden there is the train headed for the mystic ruins will be departing
[14196.71s -> 14216.79s]  soon so i have to bring this to the ice center wherever the hell that is in there
[14217.35s -> 14245.91s]  i'm assuming it's the giant wall that just broke open uh is it not okay didn't you see a
[14245.99s -> 14266.57s]  stone with an ice pattern on it i don't think i did the one guy who said it's not the right way
[14266.57s -> 14273.98s]  well i this is the thing i saw when i looked over that's what i saw i saw more than one guy
[14273.98s -> 14277.82s]  i saw like wrong way idiot like is he this bad and i'm like that has to be right because
[14277.82s -> 14308.14s]  he said that ice when does sonic use a ladder ice cap get the chaos emerald you got it
[14308.70s -> 14309.34s]  what is it
[14309.34s -> 14314.06s]  tutorial if you're frozen jump a couple of times and you should be able to crack through
[14314.78s -> 14330.44s]  okay what's that i don't know so i gotta continuously jump to the icicle and jump
[14330.44s -> 14335.16s]  you should be able to jump backwards but don't hold on too long you'll slip right off
[14336.60s -> 14356.79s]  uh that's very awkward that's awkward shoot the gun uh did i is that correct
[14359.43s -> 14363.99s]  i guess no i have the sonic run super thing don't i what the hell am i doing
[14365.11s -> 14384.49s]  i have the thing where i can just run across it these are not even on the same plane
[14385.85s -> 14413.70s]  fuck ah whatever let me see what this is an easy way to collect all the coins
[14418.55s -> 14438.20s]  easy easy easy wait wait wait wait to look down be careful not to fall off
[14438.20s -> 14450.65s]  i think i'm gonna fall off one

[14475.08s -> 14489.51s]  is there anything else can i just jump or just get away from it i guess this is totally
[14489.59s -> 14506.60s]  radical man now the real game starts this is by far the coolest thing in the game so far
[14517.05s -> 14542.31s]  jesus it's too fast i'm missing every ring it's okay oops am i closing in enemies
[14544.42s -> 14559.35s]  easy i think there's a secret right there i kind of just went right by
[14560.23s -> 14584.74s]  it's all right hurry up hurry up tricks i don't have any tricks i can do
[14585.54s -> 14600.39s]  did i just get the emerald not bad how many i don't have very many other emeralds to get

[14837.90s -> 14845.22s]  powerful artifacts in the universe don't put them in your back pocket store them in a safe
[14845.22s -> 14864.90s]  inside of a safe with a 25 keypad hash no i can't touch the water i can't touch the oh no
[14864.90s -> 14891.80s]  i can just keep doing that i'm gonna assume i'm not supposed to be able to see through this
[14891.80s -> 14899.64s]  water here am i correct in that assessment this should be a lot harder i'm not supposed to be
[14899.64s -> 14923.88s]  able to see him in the water you are oh i thought it was supposed to be you can see like
[14923.88s -> 14934.92s]  the surface level not he's a whole head yeah this is the standing in the water is weird
[14935.88s -> 14958.65s]  one more hit all right come together again come on come on i got other games to play

[15022.87s -> 15025.27s]  when is jet grind radio very soon
[15037.26s -> 15046.74s]  all right that's probably a good stopping point
[15046.74s -> 15051.66s]  we can't let him get away it's my workshop and we'll take the tornado
[15052.78s -> 15062.39s]  yeah you guys go i have some unfinished business to take this is terrible no problem
[15063.59s -> 15070.50s]  objectively this is awful but like the video game is not it's not terrible it's not that bad
[15070.50s -> 15088.23s]  it's pretty it's pretty decent the game is i think fun sonic's cool so there's nothing
[15088.23s -> 15092.87s]  wrong with sonic it's just those cutscenes are just there's not there's nothing to them
[15092.87s -> 15111.13s]  all right let's go see big the cat hey look for all the sonic is still around sonic is still
[15111.13s -> 15116.57s]  kicking he's still he's doing just fine go to the mystic ruins you might find something

[16491.24s -> 16496.04s]  claiming that it is their way of expressing themselves to the world however ever since the
[16496.04s -> 16500.44s]  metropolitan government and the financial conglomerate the ruca group combined their
[16500.44s -> 16505.56s]  efforts to co-found the 21st century project the streets of tokyo to have never been the

[18662.58s -> 18691.66s]  this man this game is very good but it's very very precise and very hard and there's a lot of
[18691.66s -> 18698.70s]  you know if you like characters admission fucking wood and you'll love it but no this game is
[18698.70s -> 18705.19s]  actually very cool it paved the way for a defining genre of bending genre creating
[18706.31s -> 18726.26s]  experience finish it how much more is this that's gonna be at least a million
[18731.83s -> 18738.66s]  like leave now you don't get to quit this one i have one who said i was gonna quit
[18762.49s -> 18779.93s]  stop sticking a real bad shot no that's not what i wanted to do
[18812.82s -> 18842.55s]  i got it you don't need to get the greens yeah but they're extra points
[18853.72s -> 18857.16s]  that's the end of the stream boys no it's not the end of the screen
[18857.88s -> 18860.70s]  we're not done we might be done with this game
[18885.64s -> 18891.19s]  i want to get off of the rail like you stop blowing me to rails
[18893.11s -> 18896.55s]  it's like a hat okay when i want to jump on a rail it's like no you know you didn't do

[18908.47s -> 18957.45s]  one here lady it's 15 year old me play this game no i've got it took five that was jet
[18957.45s -> 18974.73s]  set radio uh it's a good game it's just um it's just very very difficult very precise
[18975.69s -> 18979.37s]  and you can't play it like tony hawke you have to pretend you're made out of wood and that your
[18979.37s -> 18995.86s]  shoes have glue on them that's how you play it's a good game it's in it's very interesting
[18999.19s -> 19009.45s]  go back to floygan he's too salty i'm not salty i'm not it's just i think that has a
[19009.45s -> 19016.87s]  lot of learning curve and i don't want to sit there and play that all day it's i'm not mad
[19016.87s -> 19021.19s]  at that game it's just i i'm it's it's a it's i i've told you a thousand times it's a very
[19021.19s -> 19037.26s]  good game how do i get space channel five to work how did you survive crazy taxi learning
[19037.26s -> 19050.06s]  curve but not jet set radio because fast car go fast and there's money involved all right
[19050.06s -> 19055.26s]  let me give me a second i'm gonna take one last break we're gonna come back and i'm gonna
[19056.22s -> 19063.08s]  i'm gonna try space channel five i'm gonna google this in a minute so i'll figure it out if we can

[19282.68s -> 19287.56s]  it to work i'm missing character models i've restarted the game and it's fine like uh

[23364.68s -> 23389.83s]  It's another one in the bag I think I got this
[23394.73s -> 23399.78s]  Shut up
[23399.78s -> 23451.07s]  Rock, I don't know why I looked at chat to see what people were saying. You can't do that. Hey, what am I gonna?

[23516.98s -> 23533.71s]  Fuck oh my goodness gracious. That was just too many things. Oh
[23543.02s -> 23562.92s]  He needs a parry I
[23562.96s -> 23565.78s]  Guess maybe playing through them a couple of times
[23566.22s -> 23571.38s]  playing through more than twice you can start to memorize things, but
[23572.14s -> 23580.39s]  No secrets
[23581.23s -> 23588.75s]  What happens face Michael, yeah, that's a really good question
[23595.78s -> 23598.42s]  The achievement by the way for that was who
[23599.02s -> 23605.66s]  H o o o o for those of you gnomes in the chat that find that to be very interesting
[23625.99s -> 23634.03s]  I haven't hit the wall yet. So we're gonna keep going Michael's fine. He's right here
[23635.07s -> 23639.67s]  It's a weird level. Good evening, everybody. We heard it through pines broadcast
[23642.88s -> 23656.37s]  We see something ahead, what's that the reading on Persian the president points us in favor where level
[23656.97s -> 23662.06s]  The film grain is actually hurting my face. It's alright
[23662.74s -> 23666.32s]  We got them
[23667.32s -> 23672.00s]  The whole cruise here the entire Final Fantasy party memorize the poses
[23683.45s -> 23693.27s]  My fucking hands my fucking hands now do it again, I slipped off I slipped off the fucking controller
[23706.25s -> 23711.69s]  I've pressed it and it went and my grease covered finger flipped over
[23714.73s -> 23718.65s]  What's that the reading on Persian the president points us in this direction
[23719.53s -> 23724.22s]  That's not even a real problem. It's time to take a break what I
[23725.18s -> 23727.49s]  Just slipped off my controller
[23758.54s -> 23761.55s]  Yeah, that is Michael Jackson
[23775.04s -> 23785.39s]  Oh
[23838.02s -> 23849.55s]  It's the pattern that they come out in oh my fucking Jesus
[23849.71s -> 23851.71s]  Okay
[23864.98s -> 23871.14s]  The pauses take you out of the beat and make you have to like memorize what you just saw and heard
[23871.34s -> 23876.36s]  Five seconds later and it's hard for your brain to do that. That's why it's intentional
[23876.88s -> 23882.13s]  For them to put it like that
[23899.47s -> 23901.47s]  Michael
[23907.30s -> 23923.75s]  Oh
[23923.75s -> 23928.35s]  My god, I know I might need a break that person was right that person was right. I need a break
[23928.35s -> 23936.59s]  I have no idea what this is
[23943.04s -> 23945.84s]  What
[23947.56s -> 23958.36s]  That's I gotta do the whole thing good evening everybody we heard it through pines broadcast
[23962.58s -> 23973.24s]  Can't skip this either we see something ahead. What's that the reading on Persian the president?
[23973.52s -> 23975.44s]  points us in this direction
[23975.44s -> 23982.18s]  Come back another time to it. I probably you know, I probably will this game's a lot of fun. Let me try it one more time
[23987.84s -> 23990.78s]  This is very very fun game
[24012.45s -> 24018.34s]  Play it while you're drunk. That would be the worst mistake ever
[24019.98s -> 24047.27s]  No stars lost there. No stars have been lost. This is the hard one
[24048.59s -> 24073.74s]  Yeah, I missed it already fuck it up already. Oh, this is hell trying to memorize it in the rail. God damn it
[24073.74s -> 24075.62s]  I couldn't get it. I
[24075.62s -> 24078.64s]  Thought I was I was paying attention to the last three and then I blew it
[24084.78s -> 24098.38s]  Got that one I fucking missed it
[24102.46s -> 24104.82s]  Just give me the star I
[24106.26s -> 24110.38s]  Blinked and I missed the first one. I actually blinked and I fucking didn't catch the first one
[24138.58s -> 24142.18s]  All right, let me pay attention this one it's just all my eyes on screen we go
[24160.18s -> 24171.70s]  My fucking lord
[24172.06s -> 24177.59s]  No
[24177.59s -> 24181.60s]  My god, it's really not that big of a deal
[24181.60s -> 24186.96s]  It's just when they go past like an eight or nine sequence like more than seven or eight in a sequence
[24186.96s -> 24189.22s]  It's like god you have to like memorize
[24190.52s -> 24203.26s]  What?

[25126.17s -> 25135.88s]  It is a port of a dreamcast game and it's very good, but I want to come back fresh tomorrow
[25135.88s -> 25144.65s]  I'll play tomorrow. I'm gonna beat it tomorrow. It's gonna be fucking very fun. This game sucks. No
[25145.17s -> 25146.65s]  What are you talking about?
[25146.65s -> 25162.21s]  What how could you say that they get that game is so charming and fun and interesting
[25162.85s -> 25164.30s]  But anyways

[25194.98s -> 25199.50s]  Jet set radio it's hard to learn but with you if you sit down and give it the time necessary
[25199.98s -> 25204.82s]  About 10 to 20 hours, maybe 40 hours of time. You'll learn it and it's a very good game
[25204.82s -> 25207.64s]  I'm sure you'll enjoy it. These are all in the dreamcast collection
[25208.22s -> 25216.12s]  When I'm gonna play seaman when I get it reshipped
[25216.66s -> 25224.82s]  Because they got shipped to me with the microphone missing so I couldn't play it so I returned it
[25225.22s -> 25231.83s]  And I know another I have to get another one, but that's gonna wrap it up for tonight

[25295.80s -> 25300.78s]  I just simply quit the game and put the controller down very very hard and
[25302.77s -> 25305.73s]  Air exhaled out of my nose very fast
[25306.29s -> 25310.43s]  That's not a rage quit. That is I ended the session of the game
[25310.43s -> 25318.19s]  I was playing and I'm gonna come back and do it again tomorrow with a little bit of rage you might say no
[25318.19s -> 25326.69s]  No, I wouldn't say that I would say with a slight discomfort level. Hey, is it a rage quit?
[25326.69s -> 25329.33s]  That's not a rage quit because I'm gonna I just I'm coming back and playing it tomorrow
[25330.05s -> 25335.98s]  Wouldn't a proper rage quit be that I'm not gonna ever play it again and fuck this game
[25335.98s -> 25342.88s]  I didn't did you ever hear me say fuck this game. Mm-hmm. I just simply am stopping my session

[25414.89s -> 25416.49s]  2007 Blackberry
[25416.49s -> 25423.18s]  Crossed with an Apple 2. Well, this came out before iPhones even existed. So the iPhone has
[25424.18s -> 25425.90s]  Apple 2 has
[25425.90s -> 25431.42s]  The graphics of the Dreamcast, you know, they copy the Dreamcast 2007 Blackberry
[25431.86s -> 25439.04s]  We think they got the idea from but thank you yet went for the one dollar
[25440.10s -> 25443.54s]  Fun fact. I'm not actually a professional artist. I just like to draw my free time
[25444.14s -> 25447.02s]  This time I have drawn a portrait of you in Shito
[25448.93s -> 25452.41s]  Once again, I prefer you just keep the link to the high-res image

[25632.00s -> 25635.20s]  In fact, I don't even think it was my intent to post it once
[25635.84s -> 25638.21s]  But anyway, here's another video
[25638.49s -> 25640.49s]  Thank you for $15 and
[25641.29s -> 25643.57s]  Take a closer. Look at that snout
[25644.65s -> 25654.44s]  That's Phantom of the Opera again. It's a
[25656.69s -> 25659.98s]  Mouse rat thing. I don't know what this is
[25662.39s -> 25664.82s]  But it's very clearly Phantom of the Opera
[25666.36s -> 25674.56s]  So, thank you some guy for the $15 and the Phantom of the Opera. Hey father frogman. Thanks for the one dollar

[25682.24s -> 25685.58s]  So how's the comb stream talk to chat stream idea coming along?
[25685.88s -> 25690.96s]  The classic comb streams where you just sit in front of the camera and talk or some real comedy German moments
[25691.16s -> 25693.16s]  And I'd love to see it become more of a regular thing
[25693.52s -> 25701.22s]  Yeah, I've thought about it before but here's the thing about stuff like that, right?
[25701.42s -> 25702.95s]  Ah
[25702.95s -> 25705.03s]  It's
[25705.03s -> 25711.00s]  Everything you've ever seen me do like on like the IRL streams just kind of happened, right?
[25711.00s -> 25714.28s]  It wasn't like here I'm gonna plan this and I'm gonna do that and here we go
[25714.28s -> 25716.28s]  Yeah, this is the thing. I'm gonna do is a bit today
[25716.80s -> 25722.72s]  We kind of just sit there and it just happens. So, I don't know planning out IRL streams in particular
[25722.72s -> 25724.36s]  I don't know if I if it's a good idea anymore
[25724.36s -> 25729.24s]  I feel like they naturally will just happen when they need to and when they will I
[25729.66s -> 25739.71s]  Feel the same way about a lot of different other pieces of content, right?
[25740.27s -> 25749.19s]  Stuff just kind of naturally has to happen and putting myself on like a once a week or once every oh, it's the comb stream
[25749.19s -> 25752.43s]  Here we go. Here comes the comedy. Like here it comes
[25753.43s -> 25761.86s]  That's not gonna really work because that's not how I operate. So just stream yourself sleeping
[25765.12s -> 25768.55s]  You can't do that on Twitch you get banned
[25768.55s -> 25778.51s]  I mean some of the most fun moments I've ever had on this stream came from things that I didn't even know was
[25778.51s -> 25787.67s]  Gonna happen until 10 seconds before they happened. I mean take that as you will I guess but that's sort of how it works
[25788.27s -> 25796.01s]  Can't wait for the next funny Friday
[25796.41s -> 25812.24s]  Like accidentally being naked. Yeah, like that was a funny plan thing. I was pretend. Everybody knows that but thank you Timmy Tim tan

[26102.68s -> 26104.68s]  My sister got her license
[26104.92s -> 26110.66s]  punk singers
[26110.70s -> 26116.97s]  Anything is edible at least once. Well, I mean could you eat that shirt?
[26117.53s -> 26118.97s]  You could
[26118.97s -> 26121.52s]  It would be incredibly ill-advised
[26122.08s -> 26123.88s]  That would be a very bad idea
[26123.88s -> 26128.64s]  You would get sick something bad you did you get like a blockage in your attack that you can't you shouldn't do that
[26128.72s -> 26130.40s]  Do not do that
[26130.40s -> 26133.69s]  It technically is you could
[26134.33s -> 26147.85s]  But do not do it. I'm gonna eat it. I didn't tell you to I'm telling you right now. Do not do that
[26149.41s -> 26166.10s]  Absolutely, do not consume that shirt wear it run from it. Thank you door cube again for the $1
[26168.83s -> 26171.75s]  Fat fart master. Okay, never mind
[26173.39s -> 26175.63s]  Thank you Jebediah for the
[26176.35s -> 26186.64s]  $10 you ever gonna post on the main channel again. I have no plan to we've gone over it more than a
[26187.04s -> 26189.22s]  dozen times at this point
[26189.26s -> 26196.62s]  Probably not that channel is gonna stay there. It's never gonna come down but in the current landscape of how
[26198.74s -> 26202.96s]  Things work right now on twitch. I don't have time to make a video
[26203.42s -> 26205.97s]  I really don't
[26205.97s -> 26208.21s]  Streaming I used to make a video once a week
[26208.53s -> 26215.28s]  But now instead of making a video that takes me four days to make you know
[26215.38s -> 26222.13s]  Four or five days to make it or come up with an idea now. I just stream four days a week
[26224.22s -> 26237.72s]  Sometimes less sometimes more and I'm not going to just make a video because I have to if that makes any sense
[26238.16s -> 26241.09s]  I'm not going to just be like I got to make a video
[26241.09s -> 26244.61s]  I have to because then that's not why I wanted to make a video in the first place
[26244.65s -> 26253.82s]  I will never phone in a stream. I will never phone in a video. I just I don't want to that's not why I want to
[26253.82s -> 26258.70s]  Do it. So hey, well, you got to make a new video on the main channel. It's like I but I don't
[26260.69s -> 26261.93s]  because
[26261.93s -> 26267.14s]  Going back and trying to do a video just because I have to do a video
[26267.50s -> 26275.66s]  That's not gonna happen. The magic will not be there the it just won't feel fun
[26275.66s -> 26282.62s]  It won't be something I'm interested in currently all of my interests right now are on trying to make like live
[26283.42s -> 26287.08s]  Stuff and obviously since the move to Vegas
[26287.08s -> 26295.92s]  You've already seen a handful of streams that have taken a lot more time to make and like I said once every like 30 to 40
[26295.92s -> 26299.90s]  Days, you're gonna see something else. It just depends on exactly what I want to do
[26299.90s -> 26304.26s]  But that is the new interest in the new thing that I want to try
[26304.26s -> 26316.17s]  I don't know what you could upload that people won't be upset about at this point. Yeah, but there's
[26316.85s -> 26319.92s]  There are a million reasons why?
[26320.00s -> 26329.86s]  But I've I'm not gonna just do it if I get the urge and it's like something that I want to do and hey
[26330.46s -> 26333.10s]  This would be great as a YouTube video
[26333.10s -> 26336.36s]  Maybe I'll work on it and try to put it up and now obviously we'd talk about it
[26336.36s -> 26340.06s]  But I want to try to transition to more
[26341.34s -> 26358.83s]  Experience live experience based content because it's fun and it has to be it's a natural progression, right? Because
[26359.35s -> 26364.00s]  You we talked about it literally 20 minutes ago. Not even I
[26364.40s -> 26368.27s]  I
[26368.27s -> 26370.79s]  Need to be interested. I have to be
[26371.47s -> 26376.23s]  It's just not it's not something that I can do. I'm not capable of
[26376.95s -> 26385.62s]  Putting a face on and uploading a video because I want to but I'm sorry that a lot of people don't want to hear that
[26386.10s -> 26393.80s]  But I don't I'm not gonna like lie to everybody and be like just wait a six more months and there'll be
[26394.20s -> 26399.48s]  Jerma Rumble to Jerma Rumble live to is going what is gonna be a live broadcast
[26400.40s -> 26402.40s]  Actually on twitch, that's what I want to do
[26402.68s -> 26407.23s]  No one's ever done something like that before. No one's ever tried to do something like that. I don't think and
[26407.87s -> 26414.72s]  Neither have I that's something I've never tried to attempt before so I've slowly been trying to do more live
[26415.40s -> 26425.98s]  Showy type stuff to test the waters to see how possible I think it is the WWE
[26425.98s -> 26428.64s]  Yeah, I mean the WWE has like a thousand employee
[26428.64s -> 26442.24s]  I'm talking about like eight people with like 20 actors and people maybe with
[26442.88s -> 26448.24s]  something with extensions could like vote on who could get eliminated or
[26448.84s -> 26451.08s]  Maybe you could vote on who comes in next
[26451.52s -> 26465.30s]  stuff like that is what interests me right now and over the few months coming years that I want to try to
[26466.80s -> 26472.14s]  Level up to that and right now. It's a lot of meeting people checking out studios
[26473.00s -> 26477.85s]  Talking to the right people getting the right position where it's something I could do and so far
[26477.85s -> 26487.88s]  I think I'm on the right path. We'll see but hopefully that answers your question
[26488.52s -> 26496.55s]  Thank you Peter for the three dollars and 85 cents. I had your stream audio for crazy taxi playing during my drive home
[26496.55s -> 26503.69s]  I'll just say that the honking tire screeching and screaming made for a great 4d driving experience. Oh
[26505.54s -> 26510.01s]  Jesus I
[26510.01s -> 26513.97s]  Make sure the volume is at a level where you're not gonna get confused
[26514.57s -> 26525.31s]  Be careful take make sure you're driving safely and you can pay attention to all your surroundings. Oh my god
[26525.79s -> 26532.74s]  But thank you Peter
[26532.74s -> 26538.50s]  Smelly boy. Thanks for the one dollar. They've redid the entire let it go song from frozen in Kingdom Hearts 3
[26539.14s -> 26544.65s]  Only differences Sora Donald and goofy are sitting in the background and it's hilarious. I
[26545.25s -> 26562.29s]  Can't play this on stream. I'll go to jail. Oh, by the way
[26562.93s -> 26568.33s]  An idea that I had for German Rumble live. You guys might think this is funny because it's pretty relevant
[26568.33s -> 26570.01s]  I didn't want to go to jail though
[26570.01s -> 26574.49s]  It was gonna just start snowing and this was gonna play and it was Elsa was gonna come out
[26574.93s -> 26580.93s]  The snow was gonna just start falling under the ring and Elsa was gonna be like a contestant
[26581.65s -> 26586.54s]  Everyone's gonna stop and like look don't worry. I got fucking a million tricks up my sleeve
[26586.54s -> 26588.50s]  You don't even know about some of the other ones
[26588.50s -> 26593.87s]  That that was like a bad
[26593.91s -> 26598.15s]  Not funny version of like 30 other contestants. So don't worry
[26598.15s -> 26605.99s]  I got I got an entire German Rumble live two three and four upstairs
[26606.45s -> 26610.22s]  But I ain't going to jail so I can't play that whole video. Thank you
[26611.51s -> 26616.67s]  Brawler thanks for the five dollars. That is not how you drive a taxi. It is how you do it in crazy taxi
[26616.95s -> 26623.53s]  Hey demonic cucumber. Thanks for the one dollar
[26623.53s -> 26628.81s]  I'm starting to have serious doubts in my theory that italics is doing the streams now because only Jeremy could come up with
[26628.81s -> 26635.73s]  Something as batshit crazy as skin aliens and possession by gamer powers because it must have been in his mad ramblings before he died
[26636.49s -> 26643.18s]  There are a few different theories as to how people are so good at video games
[26643.84s -> 26647.98s]  theory one alien gamers possession spirits theory two
[26649.28s -> 26657.32s]  Highly skilled video game players see the world at point nine eight speed. We've already talked about that one
[26657.32s -> 26662.83s]  I'm convinced you just you have that edge
[26663.23s -> 26670.07s]  You see the world in like point nine seven not slow enough for it to really have it be a superpower
[26670.23s -> 26691.03s]  But slow enough where you have like an edge somebody should test it point now at nine eight is now point nine seven
[26691.41s -> 26693.87s]  Point nine seven ratio fighting game players. Yeah
[26694.41s -> 26698.50s]  It's like it's like trying to catch a fly
[26699.02s -> 26705.96s]  In the air you have to see the world at like point nine six
[26706.48s -> 26712.80s]  It's not your humans can't do that unless you have the superpower that lets you slow down time
[26713.04s -> 26718.49s]  Permanently by just a tiny bit and then they grab the fly and it's like, oh, you know people can't do that
[26718.49s -> 26730.26s]  You must have fucking powers you can train reflexes with practice. You could probably bring it down to like point nine nine
[26730.26s -> 26738.87s]  I don't know about point nine eight or nine seven though. Do you see the world at one point?
[26738.87s -> 26740.51s]  0.02 probably I
[26740.51s -> 26745.87s]  Bet I see the world like point I probably see the world at one point 14
[26745.87s -> 26757.45s]  I want to test this theory one day
[26757.45s -> 26761.93s]  I want to like clap at the same time or like try to grab something and send and see
[26762.45s -> 26765.53s]  What the aren't there apps and games that do this?
[26766.01s -> 26770.06s]  There's like a click when the there's a click when it's a green light, right?
[26770.06s -> 26778.92s]  Isn't that a game and you can see how fast your reaction is. I have to do that next dream
[26779.24s -> 26789.14s]  It's a reaction test. Yeah, we're gonna do that next dream. I can't do it now. Am I I've got gamer fatigue
[26789.56s -> 26793.83s]  It won't be an accurate representation of my skills
[26794.47s -> 26806.66s]  But anyways, thank you demonic cucumber
[26807.26s -> 26812.57s]  Thank you. Just for the one dollar. Hey, Jerem, you're not becoming a mutant boomer who hates everything not yet
[26812.57s -> 26823.07s]  At least here's my parting gift. Nobody actually likes this game. Do they?
[26823.67s -> 26847.64s]  Kidding. I'm kidding. I love Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2. I'm just kidding. It's a joke guys. It's just a joke
[26847.64s -> 26851.51s]  I've loved going to the movie theater and watching
[26852.15s -> 26859.64s]  Seven movies in a row and then swinging a sword around for five seconds and then going back in the theater and
[26860.12s -> 26870.61s]  Watching like six more movies was it like 16 hours of cutscenes in that game
[26880.06s -> 26884.48s]  Metal Gear Solid 4 I think Metal Gear has less cutscene which figure it out. Let's find out
[26885.12s -> 26892.08s]  What has more cutscenes across the whole franchise Metal Gear Solid or Kingdom Hearts?
[26892.08s -> 26902.71s]  I think Kingdom Hearts 2 has like 14 hours of cutscenes
[26903.39s -> 26907.15s]  Metal Gear
[26907.71s -> 26919.12s]  Has like a hundred hours of cutscenes Metal Gear Solid 4 has 74 71 minutes. Is that no, it's not real
[26919.52s -> 26931.78s]  It's got seven games and then you called me an idiot. How dare you?
[26932.38s -> 26946.44s]  Kingdom Hearts 3 actually has a fictional Square Enix anime bullshit game inside the universe of Toy Story
[26947.20s -> 26955.88s]  Yeah, but here's the thing like Kingdom Hearts, right?
[26956.92s -> 26959.80s]  Kingdom Hearts was a really great idea
[26960.40s -> 26966.60s]  Really great games there there there are very good games. They're incredibly detailed. There's a lot to do
[26966.60s -> 26972.60s]  There's a lot to see they brought together all the Disney worlds and it was but you could go to Jack Skellington
[26972.60s -> 26974.64s]  And then from there you could go to Winnie the Pooh
[26974.64s -> 26980.08s]  It was like the biggest Infinity War crossover event in history for video games
[26980.08s -> 26986.44s]  It just was and then they came up with the second one and they even added more there was more to do
[26986.44s -> 26987.90s]  There's more to see. Oh, that's awesome
[26987.90s -> 26992.26s]  Cool, and then the second one and even in the end of the first one they kind of just said hey
[26992.98s -> 26995.10s]  instead of it being about like Disney characters and and
[26995.62s -> 27004.19s]  You know being like a good person and Kingdom Hearts is a door they went so far off the rails to a point what?
[27005.27s -> 27007.95s]  There's so much random shit going on that
[27009.65s -> 27014.03s]  It's almost like they have nine movies playing at the same time
[27015.11s -> 27019.41s]  Pausing four of them halfway through letting the other five play
[27019.85s -> 27023.77s]  pausing those going back and letting the other four play for like two hours and
[27024.09s -> 27032.50s]  Then turning them all off the game came out like what 13 14 years later
[27032.90s -> 27036.60s]  They were like a bunch of other random games in the middle
[27036.60s -> 27039.92s]  There was like a DS like a Gameboy Advance games that were part of the story
[27040.44s -> 27051.23s]  They had to like catch people up. It's like there's a lot going on and they're all canon
[27051.59s -> 27060.04s]  Wow, but that's what I mean
[27060.04s -> 27063.24s]  They got like movies from a decade ago playing in the background for you
[27063.52s -> 27066.28s]  Well, you have the current movie playing in front of you
[27066.56s -> 27073.99s]  The problem with King of Hearts is they released a shit ton of games on handhelds
[27073.99s -> 27076.15s]  But didn't actually tell you they were part of the story
[27076.83s -> 27084.14s]  But jokes aside
[27084.14s -> 27088.62s]  If you if you like Kingdom Hearts and you were excited for it, then that's great
[27088.62s -> 27092.00s]  I'm not that's awesome because let's be real about it
[27092.54s -> 27096.16s]  Hey finished the day actually finished their fucking story
[27096.80s -> 27101.49s]  They actually did it took them a long time, but they did it they announced it and here it is and it's done
[27101.49s -> 27106.97s]  I can name you a couple of companies that have not done that that everybody really wishes they did
[27107.53s -> 27115.76s]  Let me know they didn't Kingdom Hearts 3 is not the end
[27116.28s -> 27128.32s]  Kingdom wait Kingdom Hearts 3 is not the end of Kingdom Hearts. Oh, don't spoil anything, but hold on wait what?
[27129.12s -> 27130.96s]  Well, whatever they
[27130.96s -> 27136.66s]  My whole point is completely moot here that just a bit
[27136.70s -> 27142.50s]  Yeah, but this done what that's like saying Half-Life 3 never came out, but it didn't but if Half-Life 3 came out
[27143.06s -> 27149.47s]  Maybe there would be more Half-Life games like offshoots and Kingdom Hearts 1 2 3 done
[27149.95s -> 27159.71s]  That storyline is done. They thought they did it but regardless
[27159.71s -> 27163.86s]  I don't want to like rain on anybody's parade for
[27165.03s -> 27170.25s]  Liking Kingdom Hearts because I do I thought I think it's good. I played this shit out of those games the first two
[27170.49s -> 27172.49s]  I'll probably end up playing the third one
[27172.85s -> 27182.16s]  But there's a lot of strange things going on in that series and it's kind of bounces all over the place
[27182.64s -> 27191.02s]  to a point where it has gotten to Metal Gear level of
[27191.54s -> 27198.23s]  What is that? Who is that? Why is that? And in my opinion, I don't know if you should be making I don't you're making those
[27198.99s -> 27204.62s]  Statements during a Disney game. Why is that? Who is that? Where is that?
[27205.18s -> 27225.86s]  Donald Duck is Donald Duck is just hanging out in the background. Why I got a Coca-Cola writer. I got a Pepsi
[27226.06s -> 27228.06s]  That's not even whatever I need to hydrate
[27228.58s -> 27232.50s]  That's not water
[27232.50s -> 27241.02s]  But I'll probably play it. I will probably play it
[27245.39s -> 27249.60s]  By the way, I just realized what happened there. So
[27250.64s -> 27256.33s]  I got a one dollar from Jess who said you're not becoming a mutant boomer who hates everything and you linked
[27256.73s -> 27264.44s]  The King that's then I went off on Kingdom Hearts. So you just played me like an absolute fiddle here
[27264.80s -> 27271.80s]  That was very well done. Very well done
[27274.74s -> 27277.75s]  Thank you
[27278.23s -> 27282.10s]  My can't my brain. Thank you phylactery
[27283.06s -> 27285.06s]  phylactery for the $15
[27285.70s -> 27290.46s]  Dermot, you're so handsome. I have to be careful not to watch your stream and my girlfriend's around take this money
[27290.46s -> 27292.62s]  Do you appease your rugged good looks?
[27293.38s -> 27306.37s]  Thank you. Appreciate it. Metal Gear story is just as bad. Don't kid yourself chat
[27307.09s -> 27313.41s]  Oh Kingdom Hearts story versus Metal Gear story
[27314.01s -> 27319.14s]  Which one did you quit halfway through because you went oh, please. Oh
[27320.62s -> 27332.24s]  Both of them
[27332.24s -> 27341.71s]  Metal Gear is fine until four
[27341.99s -> 27345.60s]  Metal Gear 3 is well
[27345.60s -> 27348.52s]  I mean you got it at three is then this is then five and then five isn't
[27348.76s -> 27354.44s]  the beginning of one and then one is then two and then two is then four and then two actually is
[27355.16s -> 27360.04s]  Not even in it's like it's based on a whole nother storyline
[27360.64s -> 27371.83s]  Then there's in the middle of five you got the the Michael Jackson
[27372.91s -> 27374.07s]  hee-hee
[27374.07s -> 27376.70s]  Except it's more of a ha ha
[27376.82s -> 27400.79s]  Right. Nah close enough. What a great sound effect by the way
[27401.35s -> 27408.70s]  When you smoke that cigar, it's that's I love that part of that game. I love that games a great game
[27409.22s -> 27412.02s]  We talk about good games
[27412.02s -> 27415.13s]  Look at solid five is good
[27415.13s -> 27425.09s]  Anyway, saran wrap. Thanks for the three bucks
[27425.09s -> 27428.09s]  It'd be great to see Evo search for Eden on a future stream
[27428.25s -> 27432.25s]  It's a childhood favorite of mine and kind of like seventh cross was good
[27432.73s -> 27441.14s]  Much love. Thank you saran wraps and I'll type it into Google and I'll see what the hell it is
[27441.34s -> 27446.96s]  You're playing Metal Gear Solid 3 for the first time. That is I think that's probably my favorite one
[27447.44s -> 27454.64s]  In fact, Metal Gear Solid 3 is probably the only one that I would go back and play again
[27454.92s -> 27467.77s]  Is that strange the first two were very
[27468.63s -> 27469.83s]  classic
[27469.83s -> 27471.35s]  classic pieces of
[27471.35s -> 27478.05s]  Cinema right video game cinema, but gameplay wise I think I'd rather go back and play three
[27478.53s -> 27489.02s]  More than any of them. Here's think about four. I have not played four
[27489.02s -> 27496.83s]  I tried to start for but I just ran out of time ran out of I just I couldn't grab me and I stopped playing it
[27497.27s -> 27505.78s]  Four is good, but it's too long for replays
[27506.30s -> 27515.25s]  Yeah, I think Metal Gear Solid 3 sits somewhere right in the perfect little place for length gameplay
[27516.47s -> 27523.77s]  Storyline cutscenes. I love the boss encounters. I love the but I'm not gonna spoil anything because I don't know who's played it
[27524.25s -> 27526.25s]  but the different the
[27526.81s -> 27528.73s]  the different does
[27528.73s -> 27535.04s]  There's a great. I love I just love that. It's it's got a I can't really say anything, but you know what I'm talking about
[27535.72s -> 27545.98s]  Maybe I will go back and play three again a great game
[27546.46s -> 27550.54s]  the
[27550.54s -> 27556.08s]  The existence of the Cobra unit isn't exactly a spoiler. No
[27556.74s -> 27563.70s]  But a couple of those characters you really if somebody was gonna play through to the further the first time ever
[27564.26s -> 27566.54s]  I'm not sure you'd want to start saying some of those names
[27567.06s -> 27569.62s]  Because you know
[27570.45s -> 27574.01s]  Thank you. Hero of trains is for the $1
[27574.57s -> 27575.93s]  Hey German longtime fan here
[27575.93s -> 27581.69s]  Just want to say that Sonic Adventure DX needs its own stream. It actually has a story as opposed to some of these arcade games
[27582.45s -> 27586.16s]  Space Channel 5 has a story and
[27588.94s -> 27602.66s]  Michael Jackson's in that one. So I we got to go back and beat that one. They scream their names throughout the game. Oh
[27606.42s -> 27610.82s]  I forgot about some of those characters. This is so good
[27611.38s -> 27625.22s]  Oh, I could I'm just gushing about Metal Gear Solid 3 but Sonic was a fun game. I didn't not like it
[27625.46s -> 27629.34s]  I'm just not into the whole story Sonic
[27629.98s -> 27631.38s]  world
[27631.38s -> 27638.50s]  Sonic the game I love Sonic the world and Sonic the characters. I really am not it doesn't it doesn't really do much for me
[27639.26s -> 27642.63s]  Sonic the video game is phenomenal
[27642.99s -> 27647.99s]  But in my opinion, I'm not a big like huge fan of the Sonic world
[27655.85s -> 27658.77s]  Dirty Margaret, thanks for the $10. This music is pleasing
[27659.21s -> 27663.24s]  I'm not sure what you're referring to but maybe you're talking about the music from crazy taxi
[27663.68s -> 27668.86s]  Dork cube. Thanks for the $1
[27668.86s -> 27673.58s]  How much of Sonic 06 have you seen because if you haven't seen much I would suggest you play it for a laugh
[27673.98s -> 27678.18s]  Well, actually the chat will be laughing. You'll be full of rage trying not to throw the controller at the screen
[27680.74s -> 27683.96s]  Sonic 06 I have seen it played I have
[27684.90s -> 27690.80s]  Played pieces of it. That's the one where there's the Elsa's in that game, right?
[27691.94s -> 27693.94s]  You're in like the weird human world and
[27695.34s -> 27697.34s]  There's all those weird cutscenes where you
[27697.94s -> 27708.62s]  Yes, so I'm thinking of the right game. I don't remember much. I didn't get very far and
[27711.93s -> 27719.52s]  I said I made a lot of people very angry at the beginning of this stream. Oh this game sucks, right Sonic adventure
[27719.52s -> 27725.05s]  This is this one is a terrible one and that was I was thinking of 06. So I apologize again for that one
[27731.61s -> 27737.92s]  Snoozing copter. Thanks for the $1. Hey pst. Jerma. Did you know that there's an actual casino in Godhand?
[27738.40s -> 27743.98s]  Slot machines and blackjack. I'm just the guy with the bits that reminds you to play Godhand until you do it
[27744.52s -> 27746.52s]  What have I become do it?
[27749.57s -> 27755.53s]  I think I bought Godhand digitally and gave my PlayStation 3 away
[27756.85s -> 27761.82s]  I think that's what happened. I have to get it again
[27762.42s -> 27768.25s]  Excuse me. Sorry
[27768.25s -> 27776.37s]  Mini clips. Thank you mini clips for the $14 and 35 cents. No message nearly $15
[27776.37s -> 27780.97s]  Thank you so much and on top of your other huge contributions. Thank you so much mini clips
[27784.16s -> 27787.92s]  Dragon zero hexa. Thanks for the $1 place some dirty overwatch League
[27789.50s -> 27792.38s]  Overwatch League 2000. I'm not gonna play overwatch
[27792.94s -> 27807.30s]  I'm not gonna play overwatch. That's I moved on. I'm glad that people can play that game and enjoy it
[27807.30s -> 27809.30s]  I'm glad people can play any game and enjoy it
[27809.34s -> 27816.19s]  But I got my time in overwatch. I had my fun in overwatch. I just I've moved on it's not something
[27816.19s -> 27817.71s]  I'm probably ever gonna play again
[27817.71s -> 27825.68s]  Unless they make me as a character if the next overwatch character is Jerma and it's me and I have a hook
[27826.12s -> 27831.80s]  that I can kind of stick it into walls and like throw myself and it's a movement ability and
[27832.32s -> 27838.76s]  In my right hand is a three burst shotgun. It goes boom boom boom
[27839.60s -> 27841.60s]  boom boom boom
[27841.88s -> 27851.07s]  And you have to be pretty close range and then my ultimate would be I turn into a top and other people can
[27851.71s -> 27854.51s]  You can these two other people on the team have to throw me
[27854.99s -> 27858.39s]  So it's a three-person ultimate kind of I can't use it unless there's two people around me
[27858.99s -> 27878.27s]  Boom boom top. There's a Beyblade. Yeah, and I would I would have to cost fifty fucking dollars and every cent
[27878.79s -> 27894.36s]  Goes directly to charity. It's the only way I would do it. But thank you to dork cube
[27894.80s -> 27899.73s]  For the $1 this just in local streamer expects real gambling games in children's Sonic game
[27900.21s -> 27902.64s]  They had a slot machine in there
[27903.10s -> 27913.38s]  Inside that pinball machine. There was a slot. It exists. Thank you, bro. Look for the $5, dude you by
[27914.00s -> 27922.27s]  Fucking brain, please stop the fever dream Sonic game. It wasn't that bad. It was okay
[27922.55s -> 27932.75s]  This is pretty good music in that game. Thank you. Errorless for the $1 Jerma Earth
[27933.11s -> 27937.02s]  I'm gonna be rocking that shirt when it comes in for sure
[27937.98s -> 27941.50s]  Thank you to no
[27942.34s -> 27949.98s]  No, one three four for the multiple bits here and they say go back to fucking Sonic fucking go back to Sonic
[27950.58s -> 27955.01s]  I can't and
[27955.01s -> 27958.83s]  crazy taxi space channel five those my top picks and
[27961.24s -> 27966.86s]  So much so that we're gonna go back and try to finish space channel five tomorrow. But thank you
[27967.30s -> 27973.44s]  Sonic was not a bad game. Hey Freudian weapon. Thanks for the $10 Freudian these past few streams have shown me
[27973.44s -> 27976.64s]  There's a lot of fun-looking games. I missed out on for Dreamcast
[27977.36s -> 27979.20s]  Somebody games a little time
[27979.20s -> 27991.79s]  There are a lot. There are too many some would argue which is why how do you have the time?
[27992.47s -> 27994.07s]  to watch
[27994.07s -> 27997.19s]  fucking 17 hours of cutscenes in Kingdom Hearts 3
[27997.75s -> 28003.11s]  That's a whole this the amount of cutscenes in Kingdom Hearts 3 is
[28003.83s -> 28009.33s]  The amount of time it takes to play through on an average playthrough of Resident Evil 2 campaign
[28009.73s -> 28028.22s]  Who's got the time for that anymore? I know I just slurred those words gamer fatigue. Thank you. Jack the back of the $5
[28028.70s -> 28036.94s]  Better watch that coming at you. They do giggle giggle giggle wizard rivet. Thanks for the $1
[28037.18s -> 28042.70s]  It's time for slime. Thanks for the $2. Yeah jet-set radio is so good looking and sounds great and is really cool
[28042.70s -> 28044.86s]  But is really not that fun to play
[28046.10s -> 28050.37s]  But I forgot though. I
[28051.25s -> 28057.52s]  My memory is not serving me correctly here. I remember having a ton of fun in jet-grind radio
[28058.12s -> 28077.00s]  Was I just young and just didn't care. It was just simpler. It just has a huge learning curve
[28077.00s -> 28079.40s]  You just have to get used to it again. Yeah, that's why I
[28080.48s -> 28083.12s]  Can't tell you that it was a bad game. I can't I
[28083.76s -> 28086.28s]  Made the wood comment, but that was just me being a dick
[28086.28s -> 28093.64s]  I hold true to the statement that I think that is a good game just requires a lot of attention
[28094.00s -> 28099.18s]  But thank you. Thank you anonymous for the $1. Hey Jerma, it's the animal shelter guy
[28099.66s -> 28101.58s]  By the time you read this it will be my birthday
[28101.58s -> 28106.68s]  I want to say thanks for having such a great community. I've got a lot of kind words from Chad on the duck stream
[28107.10s -> 28110.60s]  Hey, love you, Chad. Oh and for the peeing so often just be happy
[28110.60s -> 28121.52s]  It's all you have most people over 70 have had hip replacements. So cheer up. That's true. Sometimes I forget

[28141.71s -> 28143.71s]  Thank you as well
[28143.99s -> 28145.35s]  Welcome back

[28190.48s -> 28194.04s]  He also composed music for jet set radio future and sonic rush
[28195.80s -> 28202.89s]  Lethal League blaze ain't nothing like a funky beat is an absolute banger that feels like a jet set radio song
[28203.53s -> 28223.07s]  Hold on a minute. They did the music for lethal league this one song
[28223.75s -> 28229.10s]  Just the one track. That's really cool though. That's very very cool
[28229.76s -> 28234.91s]  Still going 25 years later

[28243.49s -> 28246.09s]  Unfortunately Garfield has had his bits stolen by swiper the Fox
[28246.53s -> 28251.89s]  So it took a while to track him down and take the golf bucks back the punishment has been dulled out properly
[28251.89s -> 28253.89s]  He got the Monday treatment
[28253.93s -> 28257.85s]  Anyway, that's a pretty wacky video game. You're playing over there Jerma. I remember that one time
[28257.85s -> 28261.65s]  I dated a news reporter for a while. That's not a joke. By the way, I dated one she was nice
[28261.65s -> 28263.65s]  But she had to move to space
[28264.09s -> 28271.10s]  That was a very long and space but I the legend returns Garfield. Thank you the $1 Garfield
[28272.26s -> 28274.18s]  Superman thanks for the $1
[28274.18s -> 28278.26s]  Hey, Jerma was just wondering if you played any ps2 itoi games because I had
[28278.94s -> 28281.46s]  Fun memories playing with them and my stepbrother
[28281.98s -> 28283.82s]  He's currently stationed in
[28283.82s -> 28287.54s]  Sicily with the Navy as a dental technician and I miss spending time with him
[28287.90s -> 28292.42s]  Also, how many siblings do you have and what kind of jobs if you don't mind me asking?
[28293.66s -> 28300.67s]  So I have a brother and a sister and for the joke response
[28300.67s -> 28312.69s]  I have two brothers and they're very very mean and I don't like them. That's the joke response. But for the real response
[28313.53s -> 28316.01s]  I
[28316.01s -> 28320.81s]  Mean, I don't know if I want to say I don't know if my I keep my siblings in my family kind of out
[28320.81s -> 28321.73s]  of
[28321.77s -> 28323.92s]  Everything to do with what I'm doing
[28323.92s -> 28327.93s]  So I don't really talk about my family too much
[28328.61s -> 28332.39s]  That was the fake dinner. Oh
[28332.71s -> 28343.17s]  He hates his family. No a lot of you guys already know this but I keep a lot of stuff in my private life
[28343.17s -> 28355.97s]  Just private and that's just kind of how it's gonna stay but I do appreciate the I appreciate the
[28356.61s -> 28369.34s]  Inquiry inquiry, right? But yeah, I do have a they're both older older brother older sister. Thank you so much Superman

[28422.90s -> 28428.62s]  I found the real reason why you didn't die on the 23rd. It's because your real death was determined during this stream
[28429.22s -> 28436.52s]  What if your life is gone, that's what I'm hearing. No, that would imply that I'm gonna live to be driven
[28436.52s -> 28439.80s]  I'm not going online and type it in that death that like what are you good?
[28439.80s -> 28444.56s]  What what date are you gonna die? I'm not doing that. I did that once and I never I'll never do it again
[28445.04s -> 28447.04s]  No way back when I was in high school or something
[28447.32s -> 28455.57s]  I'm not doing it. I wouldn't yeah, I wouldn't do it right now. Anyways, why did I do that?
[28459.05s -> 28466.77s]  Why would you do that Friday July 4th 2059, okay
[28467.33s -> 28470.60s]  What what's what's today's date right now? What year is it right now?

[28504.24s -> 28506.24s]  You know 40 years later
[28506.48s -> 28513.57s]  40 plus 30 equals 80. Well, I'm sir. I'm 33 right now and
[28515.21s -> 28519.53s]  That means I have like 40 how many more years from like 40 that would be of 73
[28520.21s -> 28529.22s]  That's all right

[28546.57s -> 28553.03s]  How many of you guys can reliably say that you could put up with my shit for like another 40 years
[28553.63s -> 28558.35s]  What is that for you could?
[28558.99s -> 28564.78s]  Can you imagine if I was streaming still 40 years later?
[28570.52s -> 28573.56s]  Imagine if you had a subscription to this channel and I'm like, oh, thanks for the subs
[28573.56s -> 28576.64s]  Oh you guys that thanks for the 37 year sub
[28577.20s -> 28585.73s]  Well, that's that's kind of wild. I'll have a bunch of tears

[28592.99s -> 28594.59s]  25-year sub badge
[28594.59s -> 28597.53s]  What the hell would that even be?
[28597.69s -> 28606.81s]  Imagine like other streamers I think I think about that
[28608.06s -> 28610.32s]  Imagine if like twitch is still going strong
[28611.22s -> 28614.54s]  20-30 years from now and some of your favorite streamers are still going
[28615.14s -> 28619.08s]  Hey, thank you ice pick 2 1 25 2 for the

[28674.35s -> 28682.85s]  2081 League of Legends world championship today. We have no what this is implying that no one else is ever gonna play video games
[28682.85s -> 28688.43s]  Ever again, why is that the implication here?
[28688.83s -> 28693.59s]  This people is still gonna be born and be playing games when they're younger
[28694.11s -> 28705.89s]  That is what it just won't or will will the old people be on twitch still and the new younger
[28706.49s -> 28708.80s]  What was generation Z?
[28709.52s -> 28717.17s]  Generation like I don't know XX for whenever they come out. They're gonna be in like holograms
[28717.29s -> 28722.73s]  So that will happen. It'll be twitch will just be well the old people are it'll be like reading a newspaper
[28723.37s -> 28728.22s]  The day we have and this corner we have
[28728.94s -> 28735.26s]  TSM and like all the TSM guys will still be there versus cloud nine
[28737.98s -> 28752.00s]  Coming from Sunnydale retirement home to yes. Yeah to yes
[28752.00s -> 28758.56s]  Yeah to yes. Yeah, there's like fights in the fucking crowd and the crowd is like 11 people
[28759.16s -> 28769.76s]  Four of them have like TSM hats on and fucking shirts. They're like throwing drinks at each other. You shut the fuck up
[28770.16s -> 28781.68s]  He's went toppy was supposed to go middle and that's the only reason why he lost the nurse will come over Dave David
[28781.68s -> 28789.44s]  What is it? Is your diaper full? Yes, but I'm not moving jealous matches over. Okay, that's okay
[28789.64s -> 28791.92s]  That's right. I know what's up water, too
[28791.92s -> 28809.25s]  Oh, but the kids will be laughing at us all 11 people are just over 80 all 11 people
[28809.53s -> 28816.73s]  You'll have to go to like the archive archive org whatever to go to twitch. There'll be a new thing
[28817.29s -> 28824.86s]  Though guys there's gonna you know understand like in in like 25 30 years twitch is not gonna exist. It's gonna be something else
[28825.38s -> 28835.25s]  It'll be like going on virtual. It'll be like going on a virtual rollercoasters with celebrities. There won't be any theme parks anymore
[28835.25s -> 28837.25s]  you'll just put on like this weird suit and
[28838.69s -> 28842.53s]  You'll like you you'll just be able to go to like Disney World online
[28843.05s -> 28847.35s]  And like George Clooney will just be there signing autographs on the ride and shit like that
[28847.35s -> 28855.99s]  You're gonna be able to walk around. It's gonna be like ready player one. We'll have VR streams
[28856.23s -> 28863.56s]  Yeah, but no that would be impossible because how would that ever work? I thought about that before too. It's like
[28863.56s -> 28868.52s]  Oh, hey, let's do this thing. We're gonna have everyone's gonna VR headsets on we're all gonna be in the same place
[28868.64s -> 28873.08s]  Hey guys, meet me on the Vegas strip. We're gonna go it's gonna be so much fun
[28873.08s -> 28877.36s]  I and there's gonna be like 5,000 ghosts just like people
[28877.96s -> 28880.70s]  That wouldn't work
[28880.70s -> 28885.64s]  What if you have like 10 streamers all streaming like in Hollywood at the same time and you just got like fucking?
[28886.12s -> 28888.40s]  40,000 just people like holograms walking around
[28889.08s -> 28897.84s]  It's gonna be like weird ghost hangout chat
[28898.40s -> 28904.67s]  Imagine trying to go get a coffee going in you with your like hologram IRL stream
[28905.19s -> 28916.21s]  Yeah, yeah, can I get a large latte? Um, what about anybody else? Oh, no, there's these 6,000 people in your
[28917.17s -> 28929.62s]  900 square foot business and they're all screaming. It's gonna be like private instances like wow dungeons
[28930.00s -> 28937.77s]  We have the infrastructure that needs to be there it Elon Musk wants to build underground tunnels
[28938.25s -> 28941.65s]  Where you drive your car into them and they like go really fast in a tube
[28942.21s -> 28951.32s]  That seems that seems very reasonable compared to like hologram VR chat in a coffee shop
[28951.60s -> 28973.66s]  There are already programs to allow VR viewers into your VR games. They just show up as little ghost headsets
[28974.54s -> 28978.12s]  they'd be looking like the Pied Piper walking down like
[28978.96s -> 28987.90s]  Walking down the street with like 4,000 little rats behind you headsets. Why does we get like a flute out and start dancing?
[28988.42s -> 29002.44s]  You could be the giant rat. That's true
[29002.72s -> 29007.85s]  But anyways, we're almost done. It's figured we talked about them
[29008.49s -> 29011.99s]  Virtual world the virtual reality and where it's going
[29012.51s -> 29016.60s]  These are serious topics to talk about on the podcast
[29017.24s -> 29022.04s]  What is gonna happen with AI?
[29022.76s -> 29038.86s]  That's gonna be weird. A lot of people just kind of you kind of look
[29039.62s -> 29046.37s]  Your parents my parents if there is the same type of exponential growth in technology
[29046.81s -> 29049.17s]  my parents saw
[29049.21s -> 29056.49s]  The invention of the television color TV and they're still alive and
[29059.88s -> 29065.74s]  We I'm on twitch right now you can open up your telephone that is in your hand
[29066.26s -> 29071.21s]  Press two buttons and somebody will deliver a pizza to your house
[29071.81s -> 29081.66s]  They've seen that they saw the Atari. What is gonna be our Atari if technology hasn't plateaued
[29081.70s -> 29085.18s]  Which it may have I don't know. That's weird to think about you just don't even know
[29085.62s -> 29096.41s]  And it's become so normal the Dreamcast was our Atari. Yeah, but when you're like 70
[29096.63s -> 29099.74s]  What are you gonna be saying about fortnight?
[29100.26s -> 29111.80s]  Above the opinion that we're gonna we're gonna go too far like think of just Wi-Fi
[29112.24s -> 29114.67s]  There are like wireless
[29116.43s -> 29120.09s]  There are wireless signals you can go on the internet without a cord
[29120.51s -> 29126.26s]  Is that that but we shouldn't be able to do that. That should not be possible, right?
[29129.98s -> 29131.98s]  No cords and
[29132.22s -> 29145.45s]  Wireless shit that has to be like mutating our DNA like 500 years from now. They're gonna go back
[29145.77s -> 29153.43s]  It's gonna be like, oh, yeah, they were doing the wireless. Yeah, they didn't have but they weren't in like the shells
[29153.91s -> 29157.82s]  Yeah, see nowadays we you know, you gotta be if you go outside you're in your house
[29157.82s -> 29168.42s]  You're gonna be wearing your you're like astronaut shell. How do you send something through a tube without a tube?
[29168.42s -> 29178.10s]  I did yeah, I don't get it. So right now they're right now. I'm holding my phone in my hand
[29178.42s -> 29180.42s]  I'm gonna type something into it and
[29181.57s -> 29190.10s]  An electric zapper shock electric data ray that we can't even see just went through the back of my head through my eyeballs and
[29191.94s -> 29195.14s]  mutated my DNA
[29195.38s -> 29207.25s]  400 years from now, we're gonna have fins. We're gonna have like fucking flippers on our asses. It's non ionizing
[29207.65s -> 29212.34s]  Yeah, and they and they bled George Washington because they thought he had fucking puke in his blood
[29212.66s -> 29226.21s]  That's not how electromagnetic waves work
[29233.93s -> 29238.93s]  German's ass flippers have not grown in yet. Oh, what the heck man?
[29242.22s -> 29245.30s]  What am I gonna get my fins
[29245.30s -> 29262.60s]  If only smarter people than you were in charge. I know
[29263.12s -> 29269.10s]  If only there were people that were way more capable of breaking any of this down than me
[29269.54s -> 29276.95s]  They just don't exist though. That's the problem. That's the that's the worst thing to have to think about
[29282.26s -> 29287.81s]  All right. All right. I'm done fucking around. There's too much puke in their blood
[29295.04s -> 29297.60s]  Hey, thank you, uh clue the sniper for the one dollar
[29298.42s -> 29304.26s]  Deep's one for the one dollar. Mr. Local streamer who has streamed for three plus years. Where are the three year sub badges?
[29305.47s -> 29310.91s]  I gotta make them. That's a long time three years in a row. I that's a long time
[29311.55s -> 29320.56s]  bless you, uh
[29320.72s -> 29322.88s]  Thank you to door cube for the one dollar
[29322.88s -> 29328.64s]  I like how you read someone's messages that said you weren't turning into an irritated old man and then immediately shout on kingdom hearts
[29328.96s -> 29331.20s]  And questioned whether anybody actually liked the game
[29331.84s -> 29337.44s]  But that was just a joke. Look I told you like 90% of everything I say is just like a
[29338.16s -> 29340.16s]  Poker it's just like a fire poker
[29342.03s -> 29344.11s]  And there's like a joke target that I
[29345.07s -> 29349.36s]  It's not i'm just kidding. It's not real
[29349.44s -> 29351.68s]  Thank you venus gothic for the ten dollars
[29352.32s -> 29355.63s]  No message. Thank you
[29355.63s -> 29358.91s]  Dr stein thanks for five dollars. Hey germa got a question for you. Why vegas?
[29359.55s -> 29364.11s]  Just curious as to why you chose to move there instead of anywhere else in the entire world such as anartica
[29364.59s -> 29366.59s]  Well anartica is too cold
[29367.50s -> 29368.94s]  You can't live there
[29368.94s -> 29375.98s]  Unless you're on some type of research base from or one of those kind of areas in anartica that are habitable
[29375.98s -> 29379.55s]  Some people do I think live there
[29379.55s -> 29381.79s]  Uh, but i've touched upon it a few times
[29382.69s -> 29386.13s]  Vegas is cheaper than la. I wanted to live in la
[29387.17s -> 29394.35s]  It's close to la. It's its own entertainment hub. It's got its own studios. It's got its own movie tv shows tv studio stuff
[29395.23s -> 29396.91s]  It's a 24 hour city
[29396.91s -> 29400.03s]  So, I mean it's 11 30 right now and i'm about to go get like food
[29400.67s -> 29402.32s]  It's late
[29402.32s -> 29409.55s]  Late, it's a late person's town. I love kind of the the lights. I think I love I love the town
[29409.55s -> 29412.11s]  I love the city in general been here quite a few times in the past
[29414.75s -> 29421.67s]  Uh, and and circus circus casino is here. It's one of the lowest reviewed
[29422.13s -> 29428.03s]  Casinos on the strip and it's my favorite one. I actually had a conversation with one of my close friends
[29428.59s -> 29430.59s]  When we went to vegas together
[29430.67s -> 29434.83s]  And we talked about we went to circus circus and we were like, oh this is amazing. I love it here
[29434.91s -> 29436.51s]  This is so cool
[29436.51s -> 29441.57s]  And then we read all the reviews online how it was like everyone but you know, it's a bit different thought it was a piece of shit
[29442.88s -> 29444.02s]  and
[29444.02s -> 29449.38s]  We had this long kind of internal conversation with and with each other about like are we the fucking weirdos?
[29450.78s -> 29458.54s]  Are we like the people that these reviews are talking about and it was a really real like existential kind of conversation
[29464.61s -> 29466.85s]  Like we loved this place. Oh, this is great
[29467.25s -> 29472.19s]  And you go read the reviews like I cannot believe how bad this place was
[29472.27s -> 29474.27s]  It's like why did we like this place?
[29474.35s -> 29485.26s]  But now that those are all the reasons it's 24 hour city. There's a lot to do
[29485.34s -> 29489.26s]  There's a lot of entertainment stuff here. It's way cheaper than la by a long shot
[29493.18s -> 29506.37s]  It's uh, it's great. I've been absolutely adoring it so far. You shouldn't base your enjoyment on other people's opinions
[29506.53s -> 29509.09s]  Oh, I know no, absolutely not
[29509.09s -> 29512.69s]  But I guess I I mean this is coming from a guy that liked the venom movie
[29513.60s -> 29530.43s]  Right, does that make me a bad guy? Am I a bad guy? I might be no. Yes
[29533.22s -> 29535.70s]  Everyone liked the venom movie. No, they didn't
[29537.73s -> 29541.33s]  You know, I mean like twitters were like unbelievable. I'm fucking believable
[29545.36s -> 29551.20s]  I can't imagine anybody enjoying the venom movie. You have to imagine that they would also be gambling at circus circus
[29551.20s -> 29571.28s]  What are these reviews? It said that I was like what the fuck felt personally attacked by it, but thank you
[29572.43s -> 29575.26s]  to
[29575.26s -> 29578.94s]  Dr. Steen
[29578.94s -> 29581.90s]  Vegas is a great place. Vegas is one of those places everybody loves to visit
[29581.90s -> 29584.78s]  But people just kind of forget that it exists and they don't want to live there
[29586.80s -> 29588.88s]  and the unfortunate truth around it, I guess is that
[29589.82s -> 29591.82s]  If you're if you don't want to be
[29591.98s -> 29595.66s]  You know for employment opportunities, there's the casinos. There's a lot of restaurants. There's a lot of
[29596.60s -> 29599.06s]  entertainment stuff here
[29599.06s -> 29600.82s]  and hospitality stuff
[29600.82s -> 29602.90s]  hotels restaurants casinos
[29603.54s -> 29607.14s]  But other than that that's not at the moment, you know, it's it's it's a growing city
[29613.55s -> 29615.42s]  But I love it
[29615.42s -> 29619.01s]  I think it was the right call
[29619.01s -> 29621.87s]  And those are the end of the bits
[29621.87s -> 29624.82s]  Can you imagine enjoying things?
[29624.82s -> 29630.42s]  I can't imagine it
[29630.42s -> 29634.43s]  See like I remember when I just told you kingdom hearts is a great series
[29634.83s -> 29638.43s]  All right, but I hope you love it and I hope you enjoy it. Hope you get a lot out of it
[29638.99s -> 29643.50s]  I really mean that
[29643.50s -> 29655.12s]  But make another fucking chrono trigger. You should be ashamed of yourselves for not doing that. I'm sorry. All right
[29655.12s -> 29657.42s]  I'm sorry, but that's it
[29657.42s -> 29665.36s]  We're gonna roll the credits
[29665.52s -> 29670.43s]  I got like the weird bug tonight for some reason they made chrono cross
[29670.43s -> 29672.91s]  Yes, they did and then they were gonna make a third one and they gave up on it
[29674.21s -> 29676.37s]  But thank you all the subs of the resubs. You guys are amazing
[29678.91s -> 29682.24s]  Sorry, i'll get to work
[29686.96s -> 29691.76s]  Thank you venus gothic for the five dollars germa everything you say on stream is the equivalent of watching someone swing a bat at a
[29691.76s -> 29694.30s]  Hornet's nest
[29694.30s -> 29699.52s]  No, it's I don't think that's true
[29699.52s -> 29705.14s]  That's not true
[29705.14s -> 29717.84s]  What did I say this stream that was hitting the hornet's nest? I'm just messing around
[29718.40s -> 29729.31s]  I really am just just fucking around. Hope you guys know that sonic adventure. I didn't say that
[29730.11s -> 29737.41s]  Liking surface circus. That's a that's a bit true. It's just a prank
[29737.97s -> 29748.14s]  Hey dork cube. Thanks for the one dollar
[29748.38s -> 29752.06s]  I've come to the realization in the last few years that happiness is sometimes hard to come by
[29752.62s -> 29758.46s]  So why bother making fun of someone's tastes if you like venom good? I'm so glad that film added to your happiness
[29760.99s -> 29762.99s]  Yeah, I mean look i'm of the opinion that
[29765.18s -> 29767.18s]  There is true criticism
[29768.27s -> 29770.46s]  There's true
[29770.46s -> 29774.14s]  You know if you think this is something I mean at the end of the day stuff costs money
[29774.22s -> 29776.22s]  And if you don't think it was worth paying for then of course
[29776.76s -> 29778.94s]  Criticism is important very important
[29780.22s -> 29782.54s]  but also i'm one of those people that I like to kind of just
[29783.26s -> 29785.82s]  Poke fun at even some of my own shit that I think is
[29786.62s -> 29789.50s]  You know that I like or that I don't like I think you have to kind of
[29792.26s -> 29794.90s]  The mood doesn't have to go as as negative
[29796.45s -> 29799.65s]  As a lot of I think a lot of critiques can be
[29801.31s -> 29804.99s]  As long as people know that for the most part you're just trying to have a good time
[29806.30s -> 29807.42s]  then
[29807.42s -> 29808.62s]  All is great
[29808.62s -> 29819.66s]  But I agree
[29819.66s -> 29823.74s]  There's plenty of things that I think are great that people think are bad or dumb or
[29824.38s -> 29826.64s]  And that's fine. That's what makes us different
[29827.65s -> 29833.33s]  You know everybody doesn't have to like
[29833.97s -> 29846.72s]  The same things fuck I could go for some gravy
[29847.36s -> 29857.09s]  The world the world would be a weird place without personal interests and opinions
[29859.36s -> 29861.36s]  I agree. It would be uh
[29861.76s -> 29866.82s]  Look if everyone didn't have different opinions and different tastes and different points of views and thinking
[29867.46s -> 29871.94s]  We would all end up just like squidward in that episode where he gets the can of bread with all the other squid words
[29872.02s -> 29874.50s]  Walking in line and going to the squidward grocery store
[29875.14s -> 29887.49s]  And it seems great for a little while
[29888.13s -> 29899.74s]  But watch that episode and tell me how it goes at the end
[29906.06s -> 29911.36s]  canned bread
[29911.36s -> 29914.96s]  Wasn't the point of that episode that he was the odd squidward and wasn't like them
[29916.11s -> 29916.99s]  and
[29916.99s -> 29923.79s]  That is much as he doesn't like spongebob and spongebob causes so many problems. It's still it's it's an interesting person interesting thing
[29932.53s -> 29934.53s]  Canned burgers exist. That's really strange
[29938.42s -> 29939.81s]  but
[29939.81s -> 29942.85s]  Uh, we had one final bit come in from dr. Steen 15 dollars
[29948.61s -> 29951.01s]  Thanks for answering the question. I'm going to go to school in new york city
[29951.49s -> 29953.97s]  And I love the fact that I can do stuff at night as well
[29954.69s -> 29956.22s]  Have a great night
[29956.22s -> 29959.58s]  Uh germa enjoy your food spend a hundred dollars on it
[29960.14s -> 29964.62s]  You deserve a feast after all the work you do for us keep on doing what you do and we will be there the whole time
[29965.10s -> 29967.10s]  Riding every ride you throw us onto
[29967.58s -> 29975.22s]  Go get your vr headsets ready and close them because we're going on that roller coaster. Let's go
[29975.76s -> 29977.89s]  hundred dollar meal
[29977.89s -> 29982.61s]  Uh, i'm not sure i'm gonna do that right now, but thank you so much. Dr. Steen
[29983.17s -> 29986.53s]  And finally ike turtle with one dollar. I missed the tony hawk stream a few days ago
[29986.53s -> 29988.53s]  But watch the vod and it was good
[29988.53s -> 29989.89s]  Have you considered trying out?
[29989.89s -> 29993.41s]  Uh, tony hawk underground or thug pro
[29993.97s -> 29998.05s]  I thought that's not underground. It's a mod. Oh it is it's a mod for tony hawk's underground, too
[29998.05s -> 30001.25s]  It allows you to play pretty much any tony hawk level that's ever been made
[30004.93s -> 30006.93s]  Yeah, that's an interesting idea
[30007.17s -> 30010.83s]  Because tony hawk 2 is great tony hawk 3 is great
[30011.47s -> 30021.07s]  I'm gonna have to type that into google. How often has germa gambled? Is that what he does in between streams?
[30023.06s -> 30025.15s]  um
[30025.15s -> 30026.99s]  That this is what I do
[30027.07s -> 30031.31s]  I just turn all right. See you guys later. I'll see you tomorrow and the stream turns off and I get my code on
[30031.31s -> 30034.02s]  And I go to the casino
[30034.02s -> 30037.30s]  I don't think I I would run out of money really really quick
[30037.94s -> 30040.03s]  If that happened
[30040.03s -> 30042.03s]  No, like all things
[30042.59s -> 30044.59s]  As long as you control yourself
[30044.91s -> 30047.15s]  Moderate yourself every all things in moderation
[30050.18s -> 30052.18s]  And you don't do anything insane
[30053.71s -> 30058.35s]  then you know if you go to the casino once in a while you can have some fun without being crazy and
[30058.83s -> 30060.67s]  have a couple of drinks and
[30060.67s -> 30068.70s]  But no, I I do not go to the casino every day
[30074.19s -> 30078.35s]  If you go to the casino trying to win money, that's that's not what you're doing. You're doing it. That's not correct
[30080.00s -> 30082.00s]  If you go to the casino, you should be going to the casino
[30082.72s -> 30085.02s]  to have fun to play
[30086.13s -> 30088.13s]  You can go play without doing
[30088.67s -> 30092.93s]  $500 blackjack hands it's you can play and have fun. You don't have to do that
[30093.49s -> 30099.41s]  But having said that
[30099.41s -> 30101.97s]  Uh, I am about 60 to 70 thousand dollars down
[30103.31s -> 30104.56s]  So
[30104.56s -> 30113.94s]  And I go, uh, I go like five days a week. I'm just kidding. I'm not i'm kidding. That's a joke
[30114.42s -> 30121.26s]  so should I start doing five thousand dollar blackjack hands if you have
[30122.96s -> 30130.58s]  50 million dollars in your checking account then it don't whatever. I can't tell you what to do
[30135.94s -> 30139.14s]  Streamer is encouraging chat to gamble. No, that's not what I said
[30139.62s -> 30141.62s]  Don't first of all don't do it unless you're old enough
[30142.74s -> 30146.10s]  And only gamble if you know that you're you can control
[30147.63s -> 30149.95s]  Potential urges that you'll have in the casino
[30150.59s -> 30155.01s]  All casinos are designed in a way to keep you there. They don't have any windows
[30155.41s -> 30158.85s]  They're all a mess of of a layout to make sure you get lost
[30163.76s -> 30166.48s]  Don't go in there alone going there with a few friends
[30168.64s -> 30172.64s]  Because then you get to keep each other honest so you can't just say you can't just sit there and be like
[30172.72s -> 30179.33s]  Ah, this is a new slot machine that I want to play just keep going keep going keep going. No, keep going
[30180.82s -> 30184.18s]  Somebody can like be like hey man. What are you doing? Ah another
[30192.14s -> 30194.94s]  In nine years of vegas. I literally never played a single table game
[30195.02s -> 30200.14s]  I went to movies buffets arcades tons of stuff. It had nothing to do with gambling. That's another thing about las vegas
[30200.86s -> 30202.86s]  It's not just gambling
[30203.18s -> 30219.90s]  There's so much stuff here. There's so many shows. There's some insane movie theaters. They are life lessons
[30220.30s -> 30227.17s]  Just don't go overboard with anything that would I would say that about anything
[30230.67s -> 30232.67s]  You know just because your car
[30232.91s -> 30234.43s]  can drive
[30234.43s -> 30238.91s]  Technically over 120 miles per hour on the highway. You're not going to do it
[30239.47s -> 30241.78s]  You're gonna go 60
[30241.78s -> 30247.81s]  65 whatever the speed you're gonna go like 60 to 70, right just because you can doesn't mean you will or should
[30261.04s -> 30264.16s]  Speed limits 80 in nevada. No, it's not nevada
[30269.41s -> 30272.43s]  All right. Good night everybody
[30272.43s -> 30275.39s]  Last one john horns for one dollar. Just want to let you know how much you mean to us
[30275.39s -> 30279.47s]  We genuinely give a fuck about you and hope you have continued success in the future. You earned it
[30281.84s -> 30285.60s]  It's it's incredible to hear that that there's that many people that are kind of rooting for me
[30287.90s -> 30293.50s]  uh, it floors me every time and
[30295.01s -> 30298.93s]  That kind of support pushes me to want to achieve the things that I want to achieve
[30301.04s -> 30303.89s]  So thank you so much everybody
[30303.89s -> 30307.49s]  Cheers to that. I'll see you guys tomorrow same time around three o'clock pacific
[30307.97s -> 30310.53s]  We will finish space channel five part two
[30311.81s -> 30316.98s]  And maybe just maybe just a little bit of crazy taxi for old times sake. Don't you know what I mean?
[30317.30s -> 30322.46s]  Have a great night guys. See you tomorrow. Take care
