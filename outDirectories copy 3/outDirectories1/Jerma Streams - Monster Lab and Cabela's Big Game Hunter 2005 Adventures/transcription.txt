[11.32s -> 73.35s]  Oops. Okay, hi, hi. There, I'm here now. I gave, there was a spoiler there, but it's okay.
[74.31s -> 82.65s]  That happens when you have the wrong scene selected when you start your live stream. But hi guys,
[82.65s -> 92.07s]  how are you? Welcome back. We're gonna go back to the Wii today. We're gonna play a game called
[92.07s -> 100.31s]  Monster Lab. Will you create the ultimate monster? Perform outrageous experiments. Build your very
[100.31s -> 106.07s]  own mad monsters. Face creepy quests and challenges in the eerie, uncanny valley.
[106.71s -> 111.67s]  And pitch your ultimate creations in fierce combat against the super evil Baron and his
[111.67s -> 124.06s]  grotesque army of monsters. To the back of the box says, he's finally playing Spore.
[125.62s -> 135.05s]  Oh, this is kind of like Spore, but probably really, really, really dumbed down. The voice
[135.69s -> 148.94s]  today? What the? I didn't do it. I didn't, whatever. Wait, it's because I, are you, wait,
[148.94s -> 154.46s]  do you think that this is normal? Hey, the voice is normal today. This is why, this is how I talk
[154.46s -> 164.87s]  for real. Wait, the fake voice is the real voice. Confused. Just confused the shit out of me.
[165.51s -> 178.10s]  It's a podcast voice. Podcast voice, tuber voice. You call it whatever you want. It is what it is.
[178.10s -> 190.57s]  It is. Podcast. How has nobody done that yet? How is it possible that no one on Twitch
[191.99s -> 202.68s]  has done a podcast? Why, it's so easy. Somebody has done that. Oh, welcome to the podcast?
[202.68s -> 205.72s]  Like, how the fuck is that not like one of the most popular podcasts on Twitch?
[207.56s -> 219.40s]  Oh, it does exist. It does exist. All right. Well, whatever. Anyways, let's go. Hope you're
[219.40s -> 226.92s]  having a good Saturday afternoon. I know I am. This is Monster Lab for the Nintendo
[226.92s -> 237.66s]  Wiimote. Monster Lab. Hurry up. Hurry up and go. We have to go. Where do you have to go right now?
[238.30s -> 250.26s]  Where are you going? Hurry up. Go, go. I have to go. Where are you going? All right, here we go.
[250.26s -> 254.58s]  This game is like, look at the title of the stream. It's like Battling Mr. Potato Heads.
[255.38s -> 260.18s]  This was a requested video game from the Discord channel. The requested,
[260.18s -> 265.13s]  recommended Discord channel. I recommend if you have anything that you'd like to see.
[265.93s -> 270.49s]  I always give it a look. TM. And if it's something that I think would be fun,
[270.49s -> 276.15s]  I play it on stream to cure the strap. No, I don't need this. I don't have a strap.
[276.15s -> 290.81s]  This doesn't have a strap. Nunchuck. One of the only games ever that needs it that I've played.
[290.81s -> 312.73s]  All right, plug it in. Sick. Oh, I thought it was a real place. Who made this game?
[315.10s -> 430.74s]  What company? Who made this fucking game? Eidos. Hello? What the fuck happened? All right.
[430.74s -> 447.61s]  That was weird. I, uh, I just went to zero for no reason. Hooray. I'll give this one second to make
[447.61s -> 460.15s]  sure it's actually going to work. Reset stream for VOD chat, please. I just did. I just turned off the
[460.15s -> 467.69s]  stream and I turned it back on. So this is, this is technically a new stream. Technically, this is
[467.69s -> 472.41s]  a, I, this is a new live stream to make sure it doesn't fuck everything up to the bottom.
[473.30s -> 479.10s]  All right, let's go. Uh, welcome to the stream. Hey, what's going on? This is, uh, Professor
[479.10s -> 487.02s]  Fuseless. This is, uh, the Wii. Playing the Wii. Welcome to the VOD, everybody. Hi. This is the
[487.02s -> 493.90s]  monster Wii game. Take control of my monster Gorbok and go help the mayor. There are two streams in
[493.90s -> 498.86s]  one fucking day. All right. We got to take, this is a monster fighting game. You make your own
[498.86s -> 508.36s]  fucking monster. You missed the intro. Okay. I'll give you the intro. Uh, think of every
[508.36s -> 518.95s]  Saturday morning cartoon from 1988 to 1992. That's not very much time. 1988 to like 2010.
[519.51s -> 523.59s]  That's not very much time. That was like three years. Actually, you know what? That's probably
[523.59s -> 536.63s]  accurate. This guy's face looks like one of the many photo shops you guys make every fucking
[536.63s -> 543.59s]  stream of my face. In fact, I'm, I'm, I may in fact believe that somebody made this out. This is me.
[544.63s -> 548.81s]  This is what you guys do. You like drag my nose up and like pull my mouth down every stream.
[549.29s -> 559.06s]  Oh, did you send you, I'm glad you're here. Yeah, here it comes. I know. I know. I know.
[561.05s -> 566.79s]  They are blocking my path to reelection. All right, let's go. I can't wait to make my own fucking
[566.79s -> 572.31s]  monster. This is the tutorial. Defeat the monsters, blocking the path. You got it.
[573.11s -> 578.36s]  I'm using somebody else's monster. This is like Mario party, right?
[578.36s -> 587.93s]  All right. Is this knack? No, this is not knack. This is monster lab.
[591.74s -> 597.64s]  Warbark versus Mongor. How do you play?
[606.92s -> 610.84s]  Okay. Yep.
[611.00s -> 618.60s]  The monster icon in the top left corner displays the health of monster parts. They have parts. Okay.
[622.15s -> 626.47s]  Okay. All right. All your limbs can get knocked off.
[632.95s -> 636.04s]  Okay. Why are the robots monsters? That's, is that accurate?
[636.36s -> 649.58s]  Oh shit. This is just the surge. It's the surge too. If you want a torso is do not move the stick.
[649.58s -> 662.92s]  Okay. So, uh, select an action. Okay. I want to make my own monster. I want to make,
[662.92s -> 665.48s]  I'm going to have like a lizard head. I'm going to have fucking pirate legs.
[665.48s -> 677.56s]  Why would I skip the tutorial? I have no idea how to play. I'm not skipping the fucking tutorial.
[678.28s -> 683.37s]  And battery number tells you how much energy your monster needs to perform an action.
[683.37s -> 691.13s]  Okay. That's, that's your mana. Oh, you actually have to point at shit with the
[691.13s -> 703.69s]  Wii mode. This is their motion control. Okay. It's like an attack action. All right. So
[703.77s -> 710.09s]  low squeeze hook hunt. Oh, I'm selecting the arm. Okay. The head I can do chomp or roar
[711.32s -> 719.37s]  left arm is auto fire legs. We're going with leg sweep. All right. This is pretty cool.
[723.99s -> 729.67s]  He looks like your opponent has a strong face. Why don't you, why don't you face him?
[731.03s -> 737.03s]  Why? You don't need to face him. When you select an action, the parts it targets on the opponent
[737.03s -> 748.14s]  are highlighted. Okay. Find an action that targets the right arm. So this is low squeeze.
[748.14s -> 753.42s]  It's just going for his legs. I squeeze his legs. That's not what I want. Don't wait his right arm.
[754.06s -> 761.16s]  So that means his right, right? His right arm. Oh, auto fire. It does. Can I bite his arm?
[767.29s -> 777.42s]  Face cam or his left arm. I was going to bite him. All right. I'm going to bite him. I'm going to
[777.42s -> 786.47s]  bite him. It does everything bite. All right. I just bit his arm off. Good. But you can grow it.
[786.47s -> 804.15s]  Can you grow arms back? It's actually pretty cool. Oh shit. So your legs become useless.
[805.99s -> 813.83s]  You can't run. Face cam. What can face cam for? What fucking reason do you want to face cam?
[813.83s -> 827.74s]  Why does everything have to be face cam? Yeah. You want a face cam? Fine. Everything's got to
[827.74s -> 837.30s]  have a face cam these days. You get it. You get it for like 20 minutes. All right. Let's go.
[840.54s -> 847.90s]  At the back of the delay. To gain more energy, select the dodge or recharge.
[848.94s -> 852.52s]  All right. So you have to, you have to actually, you have to spend a turn recharging. This is just
[852.52s -> 865.50s]  like magic the fucking gatherer. All right. Let me, uh, that is like magic the gatherer.
[865.50s -> 872.78s]  Don't you dare minus two that. If you select dodge, your monster gains. All right. We can avoid
[872.78s -> 879.18s]  attacks and attempts to avoid attacks. If you select recharge, you get all energy, but you
[879.18s -> 883.50s]  don't avoid anything. Ooh. All right. This is pretty deep. Select either dodge or recharge.
[883.50s -> 891.02s]  This shit's deep. Some energy. All right. Let's do, dodge is 33 and you can dodge or read. Just
[891.02s -> 903.98s]  yeah, let's dodge. What was that? We both did it. All right. That's it. Oh wait. Now you just need
[903.98s -> 918.41s]  to know how to win. You're going to destroy the opponent's torso. How's it still delayed? It can't
[918.41s -> 925.85s]  be. You will be victorious. Now defeat the monster. All right. Let's kill it. All right. Here we go.
[925.85s -> 931.46s]  Uh, just going to bite, bite him in his, just bite him. Bite is the best move in the whole game so
[931.46s -> 938.63s]  far. He's got no arms. What are you going to do? Oh shit. He could spit. He can still spit. All
[938.63s -> 954.79s]  right. Just bite him again. Put your face on the monster's face. There's a half second sound delay.
[954.79s -> 965.27s]  It's not even how my mic is being delayed by a thousand milliseconds and my cam is being delayed
[965.27s -> 977.78s]  by a thousand milliseconds. It doesn't make any sense. There isn't. It's not. One guy. Oh,
[978.34s -> 988.76s]  fucking one guy. Of course it's one guy. All right. Let's go. Gorbok wins. They tell it.
[991.29s -> 997.30s]  We got a metal plate. You get currency and money and shit.
[997.30s -> 1004.89s]  You're monster has suffered some damage. Use field repair to heal your monster.
[1004.89s -> 1010.01s]  This is pretty cool. Field repair restores some lost health. And you can restore. Okay. Field
[1010.01s -> 1016.65s]  repair. This is, this is pretty good. Begin field repair by selecting the wrench icon.
[1017.69s -> 1022.65s]  All right. Well, I got some, I got some stuff. It is actually delayed. What do you want to do?
[1023.61s -> 1051.10s]  This guy's an overbite. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You are freaking me
[1051.10s -> 1059.86s]  out, man. All right. Select a damaged part with the control stick. Swing the wheel in circles
[1059.86s -> 1068.20s]  to spin the wheel and repair damage. Of course. Okay. What do I want to, what do I want to repair?
[1069.16s -> 1078.90s]  Three, two. All right. So nothing. Just the torso, right? And the head. That's going to be so annoying
[1078.90s -> 1097.38s]  after a while. Why are you wearing a Kevlar vest? I, whatever. Let's keep going. I'm interested.
[1102.71s -> 1106.15s]  Bingo. I can't wait to make my own monster. What are we going to name it? You guys get to think
[1106.15s -> 1112.26s]  some good names. You guys get on here. It's a backpack. Yeah. It's a backpack. I'm getting
[1112.26s -> 1116.02s]  ready for school early. I have to go to school in like 12 hours, but I'm ready. My backpack's
[1116.02s -> 1123.14s]  fucking ready. I can sleep with this on. All right. Here we go. We got below bog versus gore bog.
[1124.10s -> 1130.34s]  I'm thinking about that fucking right arm here. Low squeeze. Now let's, let's, let's low squeeze
[1130.34s -> 1141.58s]  his legs. Good call. He just kicked me in the fucking head. Okay. I got 71. That was a big move
[1141.58s -> 1151.94s]  from him. All right. Low squeeze again. All right. I broke his legs. I'm all right. Look at his,
[1151.94s -> 1168.06s]  look at his energy. It's terrible. And then we automatically goes to the torso. Okay. So you
[1168.06s -> 1173.48s]  don't want to be, you really don't want to do that. Okay. Should I just go for it? Hook punch. Let's
[1173.48s -> 1182.06s]  hook punch him. Take off that arm. See you later. Do I have a mailbox on my arm? All right. What
[1182.06s -> 1191.16s]  are you going to do with no legs in one arm? Nothing. I need energy. Why am I getting
[1191.16s -> 1204.47s]  gears of war vibes from this? Twist him. Yes. You can block. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.
[1205.90s -> 1209.50s]  All right. Inward block. I don't want to do that. He looked at me. I got, I already got him.
[1211.19s -> 1215.93s]  Upward block. Roar. I don't have enough energy. All right. We're going to dodge.
[1216.89s -> 1225.06s]  Why do we both have the same idea every time? Oh, right. This is like sorcery, like stamina smash,
[1225.06s -> 1232.38s]  smash, smash. Hold on. All right. We're going to auto fire. This came out of the wiimote.
[1232.38s -> 1243.82s]  All right. It was done. Uh, I have no energy. All right. We're going to, I can leg sweep,
[1243.82s -> 1252.71s]  leg sweep him right in the chest. Optical beam. Oh fuck. I'm almost dead. All right. Uh, dodge.
[1256.46s -> 1264.74s]  You're going to love, he's a low energy streamer. Chomp. Dead. Holy shit. Wait, whatever. Harold
[1264.82s -> 1273.93s]  Elbertson. Thank you. Harold Elbertson. Nine eight five for the 10 community subs.
[1274.90s -> 1281.40s]  Fight him. Uh, Harold Elbertson, nine eight five, 10 community subs. Thanks a lot for those subs.
[1281.40s -> 1285.96s]  Also Kazzy gave five community subs. Thanks both of you for the subs. You guys are fucking awesome.
[1285.96s -> 1293.02s]  Thank you. That's a fucking 15 sub drop from two people. You guys fucking rock. Thank you.
[1293.02s -> 1306.76s]  Wake up Harold. Oh, you get items. This game rules. I remember playing it on the Nintendo DS.
[1306.76s -> 1349.40s]  Thank you. You could call it a hidden gem. That's not funny. That's not funny. Except my thanks.
[1349.40s -> 1355.96s]  Prefer to return and explore a beautiful village. Oh God. That's disgusting. Oh my God.
[1356.52s -> 1370.17s]  Return to the castle immediately. No, you're the one laughing because that's insane. Return to the
[1370.17s -> 1384.28s]  castle. All right, I'm back. Thanks. Your help was most appreciated. I am Professor Fuseless.
[1387.75s -> 1399.16s]  It's like, it's like segmented. It's like separated. Oh fuck you. It's coffee. I can't even drink it.
[1399.16s -> 1425.45s]  It's coffee. Relax. Master of mechanical mad science. Stop. Mad scientist. Oh, here we go.
[1425.45s -> 1442.38s]  What's my name? Oh, this is important. Make it poop wine. No. Oh my God. How old are we? How old
[1442.38s -> 1447.82s]  are we? How old are you? How old am I? That's more important. Forget about you. Forget about
[1447.82s -> 1455.50s]  fucking how old you are. How old am I? This is like, this is my stream and a 30 fucking plus
[1455.50s -> 1462.78s]  year old man is going to make his character name poop wine. Just be clear about this. This is my
[1462.78s -> 1486.14s]  responsibility. Me showing this. Oh my God. No, I can't. That's like, I'm 30 plus. I'm over 30.
[1486.78s -> 1491.02s]  You can't make these jokes anymore when you turn 35, but I'm not that yet. I'm 30 plus.
[1491.82s -> 1526.89s]  Okay. I don't care. Welcome to the mad science alliance apprentice. Poop wine. I was speaking,
[1527.69s -> 1543.77s]  I was speaking, what's, what's pig Latin? Poop wine pay. Hey, hey. This is a fucking 15,
[1543.77s -> 1552.70s]  this is like a 13 year old's stream. Seriously. Seriously say, is say, uh ay,
[1554.06s -> 1570.28s]  13 pay, ear yay, full day, frame say. I know he's not speaking in tongues. It's pig Latin.
[1570.28s -> 1574.12s]  That's like a 12 year old thing. How many of you guys are 12? You don't know how to speak pig Latin?
[1574.76s -> 1587.70s]  That was like a 12 year old thing. Remember those ingredients you received in tongues.
[1591.99s -> 1598.23s]  You can view them in your new Igor. Igor is your own personal data management system.
[1598.95s -> 1622.87s]  I can't, I can't get over this. You fucked me up for life. You fucked me up for life.
[1623.67s -> 1627.59s]  Every time I drink a coffee that gets separated like this, but no ice in it,
[1628.79s -> 1633.98s]  of all I'm going to hear is your, your screaming. You fucked me up for life.
[1634.46s -> 1643.11s]  Igor tracks your progress as well. Okay. So I got a skull, horn skull,
[1643.11s -> 1650.50s]  metal platter and thick pipe. Cool. Wait. We can use the ingredients you just saw
[1650.50s -> 1657.74s]  to make a mechanical part to flatten your opponents. When you want to open Igor,
[1657.74s -> 1665.42s]  use the minus button. Okay. He drew the workshop. Let me see ingredient received. Thick pipe.
[1665.58s -> 1675.29s]  Okay. So quest log, go to the workshop. We also got a scientist data, monsters. You have no monsters
[1675.29s -> 1680.97s]  in your inventory. Parts. No parts. Ingredients though. We can make it like a skull pipe person.
[1681.85s -> 1693.10s]  All right. This is cool. Let's go to the workshop. Make a royal flush. To save your game,
[1693.10s -> 1700.54s]  select the cat or saver. Right. Save, save the game. Save the game right now, actually, immediately.
[1700.54s -> 1726.42s]  Save it. Why am I desync? It's off. The audio is early. Oh, we've got to do something here. Okay.
[1727.78s -> 1742.82s]  Ready? Hey, one, two, one, two. Hey, hey. So my audio, me saying a is early. It's literally perfect.
[1743.78s -> 1758.57s]  My audio is early. You fucking with me? It's, this is not one guy. This is like fucking half the chat.
[1759.05s -> 1767.03s]  It's, this is not one guy. This is like fucking half the chat. This is a lot of one guy. I'm tripping.
[1774.57s -> 1791.05s]  My audio is early. Do you hear me first? How's this? How does this sound? Are we good to go?
[1792.01s -> 1812.49s]  How does this sound? Are you seeing this sync up? Okay. Good. Yo, shut the fuck up, chat.
[1813.45s -> 1818.18s]  You're still ugly.
[1821.94s -> 1830.28s]  Blame God. Okay. That's not my fault. You may use my equipment to perform experience, but be careful.
[1835.88s -> 1839.27s]  Oh, you can make it do experiments?
[1843.11s -> 1845.11s]  Holy shit, I've really seen that tiny arm.
[1850.31s -> 1880.52s]  Experiment and your ingredients will be destroyed. I got to keep this together. I can't.
[1899.98s -> 1907.34s]  Okay. Ingredients. Key ingredient. We can do, all right, we're going to do a bedpan
[1908.22s -> 1923.38s]  and a spool of wire. What do we get? Point the Wii mode and hold the B button to weld.
[1923.38s -> 1930.60s]  Fill the entire seam for the highest quality. What? A gun, if the gun overheats, you weld
[1930.60s -> 1935.66s]  outside the seam. A gun overheats if you weld outside the seam. Shake the nunchuck to fix the
[1935.66s -> 1974.12s]  gun. What am I welding? This is an operation. This shit's tiny. Oh my God. Why do they have
[1974.12s -> 1983.78s]  to make it like a tracing game? The worst thing you could possibly do for me is make this be a
[1983.78s -> 1994.42s]  tracing game. You guys know how much I fucking hate this shit. Wait, in here. This is pretty
[1994.42s -> 2017.40s]  high quality. It's good, right? Is this the game? I don't think so. Wait, we got a buckler shield.
[2019.61s -> 2027.43s]  I get it. Okay. Slow. It's 100% quality. Hit points. 39. So it's a block. It's a shield.
[2028.47s -> 2033.14s]  That's not bad. Put that shit on.
[2033.22s -> 2069.21s]  Hey D ward, thanks for the 10 community subs. How do you attach?
[2081.02s -> 2085.58s]  In the lightning tower. Okay. So buckler shield. Let's put it on, right?
[2086.46s -> 2094.38s]  Speak with useless in the lightning tower. The weldatron. There's a lot in this game. This is
[2094.38s -> 2115.00s]  very, very deep. Lightning tower. You have to make your own monster. No, it's not a pog moment.
[2115.00s -> 2116.92s]  No, I was thinking about it. It was close.
[2125.80s -> 2130.28s]  No doubt there are scrap parts around here for you. I can't. This is going to be so good.
[2131.40s -> 2138.60s]  Let's make a monster. Monster constructor in the middle of the room. All right. Make a new monster.
[2143.50s -> 2151.74s]  Okay. This is the monster constructor screen. The panel's on the left. Should I make it all wizard?
[2156.84s -> 2160.60s]  Let's just build a monster. Like different areas of your monster.
[2161.32s -> 2168.95s]  Just like you do in combat. Okay. Right now. All right. Let's do head and legs. Not bad.
[2168.95s -> 2175.59s]  Notice how those arrows move when you select a different area. I do. You can use those arrows
[2175.59s -> 2181.99s]  to choose what parts your monster is using. Make your fursona. Right now your monster isn't using
[2181.99s -> 2189.67s]  any part. Push up on the control stick. Point the weave remote at an arrow and press the A button.
[2189.67s -> 2196.82s]  Okay. We only have two choices for head right now? Push up on the control stick. All right.
[2196.82s -> 2208.60s]  Get out of the way. See you'll make a monster. I don't want that. I only have two options.
[2209.40s -> 2216.76s]  You can use that arm you just made. As a test I want to choose the rest. All right. What can I do?
[2217.72s -> 2233.08s]  Plated jaw, leopard skull, or none? I think I only have two so far. All right. Leopard skull,
[2233.96s -> 2257.02s]  buckler shield, flub arm, stone hacker, ogre arm. Yep. Ogre arm and uh buckler shield. No.
[2258.57s -> 2269.26s]  And stone hacker. And scale male body.
[2270.14s -> 2283.64s]  When you are ready, select the jaw. With wooden legs? All right. No. We're gonna do tree legs.
[2284.20s -> 2291.16s]  Do I want the shield? I mean this is the first tutorial monster.
[2293.35s -> 2303.38s]  Yeah. All right. This is good. Best thing to do. Monster in name. Every monster needs a good name.
[2303.38s -> 2308.62s]  Like mongor. I'm not gonna name it mongor. All right. I'm not gonna keep this one.
[2309.42s -> 2320.10s]  This is this this is this shitty tutorial monster. How do I how do I delete? Oh okay.
[2321.40s -> 2330.86s]  How about how about um how about Mr. Recycle? Because he's just I'm just gonna recycle him
[2330.86s -> 2341.90s]  and I'm gonna take all those parts and stuff. Like I'm just gonna recycle him. Mr. Poopster.
[2341.90s -> 2346.54s]  But he's not getting a poop. Not no. Why would I name everything a poop related thing in this
[2346.54s -> 2362.42s]  frame? Doesn't even matter. I can name him just like Tim. Or like I don't know like Paul. Or like
[2366.63s -> 2393.02s]  Tim. Paul. It doesn't none of those matters. None of those matters. How about David? David? Good
[2393.02s -> 2411.59s]  enough. All right. Let's take our first monster into combat. Open Igor. Yes.
[2411.99s -> 2417.83s]  You want to go to corner shop and get stuff. Now head down to the command room. Deploy the new
[2417.83s -> 2426.66s]  creation. This is gonna be pretty fun. I got a saw blade. Let's go look at him. There he is.
[2426.66s -> 2431.35s]  There's David. Actually pretty intimidating looking. Look at his health, his uh mana,
[2431.35s -> 2437.24s]  his attack, and his defense. Not bad. It's pretty good for a monster that this is what
[2437.24s -> 2451.10s]  there's only like five combinations. Let's go. Command room deploy him. Shitty. He's shitty.
[2452.46s -> 2460.66s]  All right. All right. Command room. I can't wait to make the most boring fucking monster ever.
[2460.66s -> 2472.62s]  This is the command room. Use the trouble scope to see. Trouble scope? When it's out doing well
[2472.62s -> 2484.81s]  monster. Other side of the room is the interlab link. You can use the interlab link to challenge
[2484.81s -> 2490.01s]  other scientists. There was internet on this. You could actually fight over the internet.
[2490.65s -> 2494.47s]  Well that's too bad that Nintendo shut literally all servers down permanently.
[2496.39s -> 2507.83s]  That would be fun. Now let's pick a region. We had internet. Yeah it did. Oh my god this is huge.
[2507.83s -> 2519.11s]  All right. Cobbleshire. Let's go fight in Cobbleshire. We're taking David. Deploy David.
[2519.11s -> 2533.24s]  I'm not wearing a tactical rig. Just fire him out of a cannon. All right. We're gonna get parts
[2533.24s -> 2540.81s]  because I want to make another monster. There he is. All right. Cool. Oh can I like collect
[2540.81s -> 2546.73s]  items or something? What's the actual end goal here? Just explore? It doesn't take resources
[2546.73s -> 2560.12s]  to walk around right? Tourism. We're getting an interesting new visitor. All right. Northeast.
[2565.56s -> 2574.30s]  All right. Northeast. Let's move. All right. That was like a loud cat noise. This is a cat?
[2575.62s -> 2579.22s]  I walked past everything. What am I supposed to just walk into the town?
[2580.10s -> 2591.53s]  Uh oh. It's David versus the insane. Shit. Okay. All right. What do I have? What do I do? What can
[2591.53s -> 2598.95s]  my twigs do? It's just Pokemon.
[2598.95s -> 2607.59s]  Okay.
[2612.39s -> 2627.11s]  Sure. Cool. So what does he got? What does he what does he got? I got scale male body.
[2628.07s -> 2637.69s]  All right. Let's do side kick. It hits his his right arm. I could do diagonal chop. This move
[2637.69s -> 2648.95s]  sucks. Ground pound or block or I could do no optical beam. Optical beam. Well that was that
[2648.95s -> 2657.56s]  was destruction. Oh fuck. I took it all right. All right. Hammer fists. What should I try to do?
[2657.64s -> 2664.76s]  So his legs are in trouble. His head's in trouble too. Hold on. Can I bite his head? Optical beam
[2664.76s -> 2672.47s]  again. I knocked his head off. Now what are you gonna do about that? All right. Now we're gonna
[2672.47s -> 2682.86s]  dodge. It's only plus two. Dodge. All right. He's going for the legs. I gotta stop this.
[2684.28s -> 2697.64s]  Uh right in the center of his chest. Diagonal chop. Shit. That's not good. That's not good.
[2697.64s -> 2708.95s]  Uh I'm not gonna flee. Dodge. Nice. Good work. All right. This is where we end it.
[2708.95s -> 2717.53s]  Uh bite him. It doesn't matter. He's dead. Fully recharged. Bite him. He's not dead yet.
[2717.53s -> 2735.08s]  This is arm. Fuck. Okay. Uh run away. Just recharge fully. The new monster rancher sucks.
[2735.96s -> 2741.24s]  This isn't even monster rancher. All right. Die. Let's see if I can end it with a hammer fist.
[2753.16s -> 2760.54s]  Wins three. Losses zero. This is the first fight. I got a bent screw. So I skipped the fucking
[2760.54s -> 2771.48s]  rewards. Whoops. This is the first fight. How do I repair myself? Don't I have to repair?
[2775.56s -> 2786.39s]  How do I? Where's like the repair shop thing? How do you repair? Go back and get the stuff.
[2789.86s -> 2805.16s]  What's? How much stuff did I miss? There's nothing even here. I didn't miss anything. This has all
[2805.16s -> 2815.61s]  the this is a mobile game before it's time. Yeah like the circles. Yeah. Get it. There's nothing
[2815.61s -> 2826.74s]  there. How do I how do I repair myself? I'm gonna die. What's like the repair? What's that
[2826.74s -> 2846.06s]  repair mini game? Remember? You missed a tinted rock. There he is. I'm not fighting any of this
[2846.06s -> 2856.39s]  stuff.
[2862.84s -> 2864.36s]  You gotta repair the home day so.
[2864.84s -> 2870.52s]  The ingredients you discover in a challenge will help you to make new and better monster parts.
[2871.16s -> 2879.38s]  But I can't seem to remember where I put any of them. Okay complete buried treasure challenge.
[2880.84s -> 2888.92s]  Electro trace challenge. Buried treasure. How the fuck am I supposed to find that?
[2889.64s -> 2912.70s]  Wait what is that down there? Why is that lit up? Is this it? Oh I got it. I modified the
[2912.70s -> 2918.86s]  telescope to allow you to see. It allows you to control your monster directly.
[2919.98s -> 2923.74s]  What? Point at the line. Wait electro trace. Not another fucking trace.
[2924.70s -> 2932.66s]  Stay as close as you can. Point at the line with the Wii remote and hold down A and B. A or B to
[2932.66s -> 2955.70s]  trace. Oh no. Why? No! What the fuck? No! They did it. Okay. Fuck why? It's like almost like
[2956.50s -> 2963.18s]  they're mocking me. Okay. Electro trace. Don't get don't get any fights. I'm gonna die if I do.
[2965.40s -> 2978.54s]  Buried treasure is the next one? Oh fuck. Leave me alone. He's playing webkinned. Buried treasure.
[2978.54s -> 3001.11s]  No? Let me repair first. He needs to repair. This game is... I'm not even gonna read what you said.
[3002.07s -> 3009.78s]  All right it's the workshop right? You barely took any damage. Did I? I thought I did.
[3010.66s -> 3021.82s]  It's the weldotron right? Wait key ingredient. Saw blade and worn spindle.
[3023.70s -> 3086.66s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's make a new arm. I can't. I'm sorry. Why does it have to be a tracing game?
[3086.66s -> 3097.99s]  I thought I was supposed to make monster parts and shit. It's good enough right? Have you ever
[3097.99s -> 3103.43s]  welded something before? No I've never welded something before. Why would I have ever welded
[3103.43s -> 3114.50s]  something? Oh I got a... what is it? A muffler? What is it? It's a circular saw. It's supercharged.
[3116.25s -> 3135.34s]  Increase energy capacity. That's pretty good. How do I repair? Turbocharged backpack. Where's
[3135.34s -> 3156.36s]  it repair? Lightning tower? How do I actually do this? You probably don't need to. It's done
[3156.36s -> 3162.44s]  in the field. Well how can I go and see it? All right we need one more. We need one more treasure.
[3165.37s -> 3172.57s]  It's the shield and the pause menu. Okay. There goes the rest of the poop wine.
[3179.86s -> 3197.32s]  Oh I got... I'm good. All right one more uh one more of these quests. This is why I don't have
[3197.32s -> 3203.08s]  the face game August. Every 15 minutes every like 10 minutes there's gonna be another 20 comments
[3203.08s -> 3209.13s]  about why is this guy wearing a backpack? Because I'm preventing it from happening.
[3209.85s -> 3220.06s]  All right what about over here? Secret! Swing the weed mode left and right to dig.
[3221.26s -> 3246.01s]  Shake the nunchuck to break the skulls. There we go. That's the gig. Got it. I found a flood light.
[3247.83s -> 3251.35s]  All right I did you... I did your missions now. Give me your resources.
[3266.66s -> 3268.98s]  Hurry back with what you found. You got it.
[3269.70s -> 3284.15s]  Uh oh. Battle time. Bubbles versus David. Looks like a mirror.
[3286.23s -> 3297.69s]  All right. What are we going for? Uh diagonal chop. Side kick. Knock that arm off.
[3299.05s -> 3313.34s]  Do that again. Foster strap. There goes the arm. Laughing my ass off. What the fuck is this?
[3314.30s -> 3342.23s]  Do I not bite him? Why is this music from Battlefield? Is it actually from what?
[3343.11s -> 3357.58s]  You're gonna lose? I'm not gonna lose. I'm gonna optical beam him right in his sternum. Oh my god.
[3357.58s -> 3369.32s]  I'm gonna lose. I'm actually gonna lose. I'm gonna lose. Uh all right. Here we go. All right we're
[3369.32s -> 3376.78s]  good. I'm gonna lose to a kids game. This is not even a kids game. This is a fucking rated M.
[3376.78s -> 3394.98s]  All right here we go. Knock his head off. How did that not do more damage than that?
[3395.54s -> 3403.98s]  Dodge again. Fuck. He recharged and I didn't. The crickets and dog barking sounds. I know. I don't
[3403.98s -> 3410.22s]  understand it either. Try block. I'm gonna pull. Okay I gotta go for a block. I'll go for a block.
[3411.32s -> 3418.79s]  Block it. Yep. That was the right call. Got him. Fucking so smart. All right now we dodge.
[3419.83s -> 3426.97s]  Dodge it. Dodge. Nice. All right. This is where we end it. Right here. I'm gonna hammer fist him.
[3427.61s -> 3442.30s]  Fuck. He's still. Dodge again. I'm not gonna lose. If I lose in the tutorial I'm taking the disc out
[3442.30s -> 3458.76s]  and playing something else. Dodge again. All right now bite him. Look at this. Why is this guy? Is
[3458.76s -> 3474.42s]  this guy like three levels higher than me? I don't understand. He's taking the shit out of me. Do I
[3474.42s -> 3483.48s]  beam him? Don't put the bite again. What is he like organic? It's like organic right? Alchemy
[3483.48s -> 3489.90s]  versus organic. You gotta step it up. I am stepping it up. All right cut his arm off.
[3489.90s -> 3502.55s]  This is bad. This is actually really bad. Recharge. His chest is alchemical. Is it?
[3507.13s -> 3519.42s]  All right I win. We're good. It's not over but it will be in a second. All right.
[3520.46s -> 3532.57s]  Losing to bubbles. Did I? Because I had just won. All right. Metal platter. Horned skull.
[3532.73s -> 3539.18s]  Mud bucket. All right. We got a mud. I'm thinking mud bucket and horned skull will be all right.
[3539.74s -> 3551.69s]  Prepare now. Poop bucket. All right. So where is this? Are you saying it's in the menu?
[3551.69s -> 3569.53s]  Isn't like the field menu? Field repair kit. I don't see it anywhere. Is it the victory screen? Oh.
[3570.57s -> 3580.81s]  Well we have to go back and deposit this anyways. So I'm playing this shitty game.
[3581.77s -> 3596.01s]  It's looked interesting. This game is pretty fun actually. You don't know until you try. I don't
[3596.97s -> 3604.31s]  know how many how many games that were shitty games have we played that turned out to be
[3604.31s -> 3608.79s]  fucking phenomenal. We gotta give him a chance. You can't just write him off immediately.
[3610.49s -> 3626.55s]  You can't just write him off. At least one. You gotta give it like at least 45 minutes
[3626.55s -> 3633.59s]  till it's been an hour. Okay. You gotta give it at least like you gotta give it at least like an
[3633.59s -> 3641.69s]  hour and a half before I put in elebits. All right. Will I talk to this guy? You'll want to learn how
[3641.69s -> 3652.97s]  to make a new monster part. Yes. Go on. I'll meet you in my workshop. You have one life until I have
[3652.97s -> 3664.12s]  to change games. That's not fair. At least say something funny. I'm not a fucking woody doll.
[3664.76s -> 3667.43s]  You don't pull the back of the string and expect it.
[3667.59s -> 3671.82s]  Uh
[3677.66s -> 3689.70s]  Let's see how this fucking works. There's a string on the back of me. That was terrifying.
[3692.66s -> 3699.54s]  That was scary. Good. Why does he have that pro? It's just an easy button to press.
[3705.54s -> 3708.66s]  I'm going to the workshop and I'm gonna make a new fucking robot part. All right.
[3709.38s -> 3721.83s]  We can make the reverb. The reverb was so high on that. The difficulty level of experiments
[3721.83s -> 3732.14s]  depends on the ingredient. That was all almost all the way. That was very very very insane. I
[3732.14s -> 3739.40s]  didn't even know. Oh well. All right. So don't get ahead of yourself. All right. Here we go.
[3739.56s -> 3758.84s]  Fortunately. We are aware. All right. Let's do head end and scrap. No no no no no no.
[3758.84s -> 3766.78s]  Oh you can evolve? This really is a fucking mobile game. Shit. Floodlight and bent screw.
[3769.93s -> 3775.78s]  This is bumped you. Sorry. Shit. This is a fucking mobile game. It's like robots with the control
[3775.78s -> 3785.82s]  stick swing the remote to smash. Smash all the robots that show the wrong symbol. Complete as
[3785.82s -> 3801.67s]  many rounds as possible to earn quality. Give me the wrong symbol. Move over. Why can I not move
[3801.67s -> 3812.33s]  it? No. Move. I moved to the left. I'm trying to. The guys are the wrong symbols. Okay. I gotta. I
[3812.33s -> 3819.32s]  gotta smash this guy and the guy over there and the guy over there. How do I move it? Why can I
[3819.32s -> 3835.29s]  move it? How do I move the fucking thing? You're killing them. I'm trying to fucking use the stick.
[3837.06s -> 3860.36s]  I'm pressing everything. Okay here we go. Oops. I'm gonna kill you. This thing's gonna be very low
[3860.36s -> 3894.87s]  quality. Woody doll. Oh sick. A new helmet. Watch the clip. Hold on. Let me see what the
[3894.87s -> 3904.44s]  fuck this looks like. Never welded before. Hold on. Look at a lot of new materials.
[3909.64s -> 3915.90s]  It's fucked up. Is it that fucked up? Hold on. Let me see how fucking bad this sounds.
[3915.98s -> 3927.94s]  What a fucking woody doll. You don't pull the back of the string and expect.
[3945.86s -> 3948.50s]  That's pretty accurate to what they actually sound like. So
[3949.22s -> 3967.74s]  they're not that cursed. Yes they are. Hey butt sniffing George. Thanks to the $50 butt sniffing
[3967.74s -> 3974.70s]  George. It's 5,000 bits for Mr. Butt Sniffing Gorge. It's my 21st birthday today. Could you
[3974.70s -> 3979.82s]  please get me in contact with Bugleberry so I can ask him to wish. So I can ask him to wish
[3979.82s -> 4012.14s]  a happy birthday to George. There he was. He just ran in here. All right do I want to continue
[4012.14s -> 4018.52s]  playing this or I want to put in like elements or like raving rabbits. You gotta give these games
[4018.52s -> 4034.26s]  a chance. You can't just fucking. We're going raving rabbits. All right I'm pulling the plug.
[4035.38s -> 4049.56s]  I'm selling it. All right I'll pull the plug on it. It's fun. It's fun. I like it. I don't hate it
[4050.36s -> 4054.63s]  but it's a little too slow. I thought we were going to be able to make a robot. It's a little
[4054.63s -> 4060.10s]  too slow. It's going to take us probably six hours to get to the point where it's like the
[4060.10s -> 4064.42s]  things that I want to do. We're going to pivot. We're going to play raving rabbits because that's
[4064.42s -> 4079.37s]  going to be a pog experience. Give me one sec. I don't even own it. I don't even own that game.
[4080.17s -> 4092.20s]  Don't own raving rabbits. Fuck. No no I just I just I just I just own the raving rabbits fucking
[4092.20s -> 4139.32s]  ultimate party collection which is every single video game they made. Come on. What. That's not
[4139.32s -> 4148.15s]  even. That's not even remotely accurate. This is for a different system. It doesn't even fit in the
[4148.23s -> 4156.68s]  same tray. Why did you fuck this up? How did you fuck that up? How did you fuck this up?
[4156.68s -> 4159.96s]  It's impossible. It's not even the same size of the right fucking tray.
[4183.14s -> 4190.23s]  Big game hunter 2005. Oh fucking god damn it. Put it in. Let's I want to see what I want to see
[4190.23s -> 4221.13s]  this game's all about. What is this fucking game? Put it in. Put this shit in. Let's have a look.
[4222.15s -> 4226.63s]  Un-fucking-believable. I can't even believe it. That's like that's impossible to make that mistake.
[4232.44s -> 4242.94s]  2004. Oh my god. It wasn't a mistake. It was deliberate. They deliberately put that fucking
[4242.94s -> 4250.39s]  game in there. Like what I'm not going to know. It's not even close. I can understand. Okay maybe
[4250.39s -> 4256.71s]  if it was like if that was loud if it was like raving rabbits the first one or something right
[4256.71s -> 4262.07s]  or like raving rabbits two you think okay like you fucked up it's a game cube game for a fucking
[4262.95s -> 4270.70s]  big game hunter 2005 oh this i don't even want i'm gonna play this game for fucking 10 minutes
[4270.70s -> 4290.01s]  not even this is gonna be this game's gonna suck oh my god male 18 male 30
