[1.08s -> 10.02s]  Hey, what's going on? Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I was like ready to start like 25
[10.02s -> 15.38s]  minutes ago, but I couldn't find my fucking brace. And after last night, I was like, I have to have,
[15.38s -> 22.10s]  I gotta find it. So I was going through all the laundry trying to find where it was. Did I wash
[22.10s -> 33.13s]  it? Where is it? And I, uh, I got it. I found it. Thank God. I was here like 40 minutes ago.
[33.21s -> 38.58s]  When you lose something in your house, you just can never find it. It's the worst. I hate losing
[38.58s -> 46.54s]  stuff. Everybody does though. Anyways, uh, today, I hope you're having a good day today. We're going
[46.54s -> 53.34s]  to be playing Mega Man Legends finally. Not pushing it back anymore. It's happening today.
[55.26s -> 59.74s]  Not going to say, yeah, then we'll do Mega Man Legends tomorrow. That doesn't happen.
[61.90s -> 68.70s]  Next week. And it doesn't happen. It's been delayed like five times. So here it is.
[71.58s -> 86.94s]  He's actually playing it. I can't fucking Pog. Pog. Black and White 2 is, no, I'm not going to
[86.94s -> 93.46s]  enable Pog. I'd like to read it. It makes, it has more meaning for me if I read it out loud.
[94.10s -> 103.78s]  There's already PogChamp. Pog is, it needs to be, I want to read it. Uh, but what did somebody just
[103.78s -> 114.62s]  ask? Somebody ask something? Paperclip game? Oh, we, I beat that whole thing yesterday. Black and
[114.62s -> 120.54s]  White 2. There it is. Okay. Right. So Black and White 2, uh, I had technical issues with it,
[121.66s -> 134.82s]  but now I, it, it should be good to go after a few more tweaks. So that is on the table
[135.62s -> 144.44s]  after this stream. So Mega Man Legends tonight, I think I can do this in one stream, right?
[145.08s -> 148.68s]  Because Mega Man Legends is only like, like a six, seven hour long game, isn't it?
[151.30s -> 161.67s]  No, it's not. How long is it? Okay. According to howlongtobeat.com, it's a seven hour game,
[162.23s -> 170.15s]  but you have to add on the three or four hours of ADHD. So we're looking at probably like
[170.15s -> 180.54s]  eight to 12 hours, seven hours. Well, we'll see. We'll see how far we get. I could do it another
[180.54s -> 185.96s]  time. The goal is to try to get it done today. I'm not going to be live over the next couple
[185.96s -> 190.52s]  days. I have physical therapy, so we'll do, we'll try to get another long one tonight. I've got my
[190.52s -> 198.97s]  boomer brace on. I'm good to go. The Sonic movie was good. That's what I heard that week, but that's
[198.97s -> 207.03s]  what I said the other day, yesterday. Prove that you have your boomer brace on. Okay. Hold on.
[207.83s -> 215.46s]  Remember these guys? Nah, what if I just was lying? No, no, I don't need to put it. Nah,
[216.02s -> 219.54s]  my camera's not working. I can't, like, it doesn't work. My fucking, the plug doesn't work.
[220.10s -> 231.29s]  Hold on here. You want proof? I've got my, I've got my backpack on. So you can't see down here,
[231.29s -> 237.35s]  but what this does. Villain. Yeah, I know. What this does is that it's not just this.
[238.15s -> 245.13s]  It's here too. You're like, it goes all, I don't want to, I'm not going to like stand up on my
[245.13s -> 248.57s]  chair, but it goes all the way down and wraps around my bottom of my ribs and like pulls them
[248.57s -> 262.30s]  together. And it feels pretty good actually. Wesker? I could probably pull off a Wesker if
[262.30s -> 271.91s]  I had the glasses. Do you think so? All right. I'm ready to play. If I had the glasses and,
[272.87s -> 282.90s]  what's the buzz? I hear a buzz. What's the buzz? Hold on. If you guys hear a buzz,
[284.28s -> 298.18s]  you will. Why is it buzzing? What the fuck is going on? Hold on. What the fuck? Why is there a buzz?
[299.06s -> 305.05s]  It's getting louder. Why is it like somebody turned on the microwave
[306.02s -> 325.43s]  next to my PlayStation? Oh, hold on. Give me a second. Let me fix this. Is it gone? It's gone.
[325.51s -> 345.96s]  All right. Hold on. I got to like, somebody move. Is it gone? It's there a little. It's all right.
[345.96s -> 360.18s]  It's fine. Okay. It's there a little, but why is this happening right now? The cable is fucked up.
[360.18s -> 369.93s]  All right. All right. Here we go. We get big bits. Where? It's not as loud. It's not as loud
[369.93s -> 373.53s]  as it was before. It's something to do with this cable, I think. Cable's fucked up. I don't know
[373.53s -> 377.86s]  what I did to it. Maybe it has something to do with turning the console upside down to play
[377.86s -> 382.74s]  Jeremy Lammy and like breaking it. All right. Everything's fine. Everything's going to be fine.
[387.51s -> 391.11s]  All right. Welcome to the stream. Let's start a new game. Mega Man Legends. I had a big bit.
[392.23s -> 420.01s]  I like the voice acting already. So where does this sit in the timeline for Mega Man?
[425.99s -> 427.51s]  He's like 20. How old is he?
[443.91s -> 444.71s]  Be careful.
[451.83s -> 454.95s]  You got the crystal? We had big bits. I'll go over in a second. Hold on.
[462.49s -> 476.79s]  I remember this game being fucking awesome. Am I wrong? Am I right here? Is this a running
[476.79s -> 480.95s]  sequence? It looks pretty good still. It's it's whole it's hell. This is PlayStation 1.
[485.11s -> 499.08s]  This is PS1, guys. This is not emulation. This is not. This is all original hardware. Well,
[499.08s -> 504.92s]  PlayStation 2. But still it looks pretty good for PS1. Oh shit. All right. Hold on. So that's
[506.04s -> 511.10s]  oh wow. It's it's full 3D. One of the first ever full 3D games.
[514.71s -> 529.35s]  Okay. Reaverbot. Reaverbot. Okay. You square to fire. Press the R2 button to automatically
[529.35s -> 542.25s]  lock onto the nearest target. All right. Yeah. These things. Oh, there it is.
[543.48s -> 555.72s]  Oh shit. That's awesome. All right. Let's go. All right. I already love it. I already love it.
[563.26s -> 568.30s]  This is janky. No, it's not. This is mega. Hey, this is the fucking this is the most legendary
[568.30s -> 580.78s]  Mega Man game that's ever been released. I do. It's right here. It's right in front of me.
[586.23s -> 589.75s]  Dude, I can't wait just to do the fucking stock market midi game that's in this one, too.
[591.10s -> 608.57s]  That's it. Yeah. Always open stuff. Oh shit. Is there a zoom out the camera button?
[609.29s -> 622.90s]  I can't watch like it upgrades. I don't know. No, I don't like this. This is not. This is I want
[622.90s -> 634.02s]  to pull the camera out a little bit. No, I don't like it. Increase FOV. No, actually, it's pretty
[634.02s -> 646.98s]  good. One thing I wish I could do is make. All right, I can jump, right? A, B, X. Use X jump.
[646.98s -> 651.54s]  If you can't make it in one jump, you can sometimes grab onto the edge and pull yourself up.
[654.73s -> 667.10s]  Cool. There is a jump here. I want to make, uh, can I free look law map now? Wait, directional
[667.10s -> 674.23s]  button turn. So wait a minute. So I can do what the hell does that mean? Because I want to make
[674.23s -> 677.99s]  it so I wish I could do my right stick, but the right stick didn't exist for PlayStation one,
[677.99s -> 686.34s]  right? The voices are quiet. I mean, I don't think there's anything I can do about that.
[687.86s -> 692.18s]  Did it? No, it didn't. It did. It had the left stick, right? No. What? Did it have two sticks?
[692.18s -> 701.74s]  Did a PlayStation one originally? No, it didn't have any. Oh, that's way better. Yeah. I don't
[701.74s -> 710.95s]  want L1, R1 to turn. That's so much better. Yeah, that's a thousand times better. I can actually
[710.95s -> 732.92s]  turn. It's kind of like tank controls when you do this, but it's all right. It's much better than
[732.92s -> 744.70s]  it was before. What is that? Oh, it's alive. Wait, should I jump on it? Okay. Can I not grab this
[744.70s -> 755.86s]  ledge? Oh, it's a ton of money. Oh, nice. Explanation. Quantum refractors are large
[755.86s -> 760.50s]  crystals that provide energy for machines. They can also be used as currency. Not a big deal.
[760.50s -> 764.74s]  If you're finally lucky, if you're really lucky, you might find an orange energy cube.
[767.64s -> 782.06s]  Grab it to recharge your life gauge. Oh my God, it disappeared. What? Oh, that was so much money
[782.78s -> 801.80s]  that I don't have now. Holy shit. I was too slow. How could I have been? What was that?
[801.80s -> 812.17s]  Oh, it's an energy field. Wait, Mega Man. Wait. Okay. Fuck you game. I thought Mega Man was two
[812.17s -> 817.40s]  words. Do I have to change everything? Do I have to change my title? Use R2 to track enemies above
[817.40s -> 825.66s]  and below you that are out of your field of sight. Oh look, you're up there, aren't you?
[826.54s -> 837.86s]  Oh shit. Maybe I actually want to keep it on L1, R1. I feel like it's a part of the... Yeah,
[838.02s -> 854.97s]  maybe I do. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll get used to it. I'll get used to it.
[855.61s -> 864.50s]  Because then I can actually keep enemies in frame. Yeah, I'll get used to it. L1, R1. Say the line.
[864.50s -> 869.54s]  That wasn't even a giant. That was not even a... No. I don't say the line for things that aren't
[869.54s -> 881.13s]  even the line. Come on, get it. Just like the original Mega Man. You jump and jump, jump,
[881.93s -> 906.97s]  jump and shoot, jump and shoot. Yeah. Oh, you found 560 zenny. Hold on. There's a Kingdom Hearts
[906.97s -> 914.57s]  currency? You got Power Razor. You said 10... We had... Hold on. Wait. We had $50 come in too.
[915.29s -> 919.58s]  We had 10 community subs from Wosse. 10 community subs from Vertible Giant.
[920.47s -> 924.15s]  Thanks, both of you. And then we had 5,000 bits from Bitslave. They say, hey, German, thanks to
[924.15s -> 933.19s]  you. I got Johnny Walker. Check out the review. What Johnny Walker... Wait, what Johnny Walker
[933.19s -> 943.59s]  did you get? That's important. Got Black Label. It's all right. I said that's pretty good. I mean,
[943.59s -> 958.50s]  I'm a Johnny Walker blue guy myself, but... Let's see what you think. Don't smell it. Just drink it.
[958.50s -> 964.74s]  Look at Mr. Fancy Pants. You buy a blue label and you drink it over the course of like five years.
[966.38s -> 969.26s]  I'm going to defend that in just a second here. Hold on. What do you think?
[971.80s -> 992.31s]  Pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good. I think he liked it. 895? What? 895.
[998.17s -> 1008.10s]  German 895. Oh, that's fucking funny. Liquid. All right. I quote, first of all,
[1008.10s -> 1015.45s]  thanks for the 5,000 bits. Glad you like it. Also, Plane Dad says hi. Tell Plane Dad I said hello.
[1017.69s -> 1022.78s]  Thank you. Oh, I'm glad you liked it. It's good shit. Explanation. Hold on. We'll talk about this
[1022.78s -> 1027.42s]  in a second. Power Razor is a Mega Man Buster part. Attaching Buster parts allows you to power up
[1027.42s -> 1031.82s]  your Buster gun. You can attach Buster parts by pressing the start button to go to the menu
[1031.82s -> 1050.74s]  and select equip from the Buster. Buster parts. Why is there nothing here? Oh, attack plus one
[1050.74s -> 1062.14s]  attack. Sick. Oh, I love it already. I love it already. It's already equipped. Let's go.
[1062.14s -> 1073.00s]  Look at it. It's a little bigger too. Nice. I haven't even found that if I didn't go down
[1073.00s -> 1078.09s]  the right hallway. All right. Anything else? No. How do I get a big view of the map?
[1079.43s -> 1086.65s]  Select. And they thought, look at how far. Look at fucking Capcom. You know what I mean?
[1086.65s -> 1098.38s]  Is there a door over here that I could've gone in? No. Just didn't explore it. Oh, Capcom does it
[1098.38s -> 1106.78s]  again. There's a blue door over here. Oh, no. I got it right in the plasma.
[1112.31s -> 1119.24s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[1127.50s -> 1130.54s]  That's not a bad Mega Man. That's not a bad Mega Man at all.
[1135.46s -> 1166.57s]  Boss battle. How do I do the dodge? There's no dodge roll. Yeah, there is. I did it a few times
[1166.57s -> 1190.28s]  already. Shit, I'm just going nuts. Do I have to be locked on first? I'm gonna need it. Yeah,
[1190.28s -> 1196.14s]  you can lock on. You don't have to lock on though. It goes in the direction that you're aiming
[1196.14s -> 1217.70s]  whatever enemy is there. Buy no helmet. He's protecting everything on his whole body except
[1217.70s -> 1235.96s]  for his head. The most important part. You can get one later? All right, cool. All right. Anyways,
[1235.96s -> 1241.96s]  if you buy an expensive bottle of alcohol like whiskey or like an expensive tequila or something,
[1244.12s -> 1246.60s]  you're not supposed to drink it all in one, two, three days.
[1248.28s -> 1252.09s]  You don't buy like a $300 bottle of whiskey and drink it in one day.
[1252.73s -> 1271.62s]  No, you drink. That's a special occasion alcohol. Again? Okay, if you buy a bottle of
[1273.18s -> 1280.18s]  um, Jack Daniels, what like, who cares?
[1304.58s -> 1308.10s]  Sponsored content. There's actually people that think that Johnny Walker Blue is disgusting and
[1308.10s -> 1315.94s]  that I'm disgusting for liking it because it's a blend. You are gross. You should be drinking
[1315.94s -> 1338.52s]  right out of the barrel from one source. What's going on? I thought the game froze. Why does
[1338.52s -> 1364.92s]  this ship look like it's flying upside down? It is. Oh, we're not at work anymore. You can
[1364.92s -> 1373.56s]  call me. You can call me Dave. We should be able to get by with that for a while.
[1375.51s -> 1379.27s]  We're as easy to find as this. Don't worry. We'll find it someday.
[1379.99s -> 1382.87s]  And your parents too. Thanks. I know we will.
[1395.99s -> 1404.49s]  Who is this guy? I can tell he's going to be shady because he's got one of these
[1404.49s -> 1408.81s]  voices that they have in every single cartoon. He's going to be a little weird.
[1441.21s -> 1461.14s]  Mega Man, go help the guy. That's why you wear a fucking helmet.
[1461.14s -> 1463.62s]  Both of you. Hope this is a lesson for all three of you actually.
[1485.05s -> 1494.63s]  I can't wait for the upgrades. I'm so excited to upgrade. Who cares about the game? I just
[1494.63s -> 1496.79s]  care about the numbers going up.
[1497.27s -> 1506.30s]  soon. We'll be here for a while, I guess. This island. What do you call it, Mega Man?
[1506.86s -> 1530.79s]  Catalocks. I think you could go take a look around. Sure. There's a kick. Who's this?
[1532.04s -> 1537.56s]  Hi, my name's Data. But you already knew that, didn't you? I mean, we've been friends for years,
[1537.56s -> 1543.61s]  right? Right. Yeah, of course I do that. Come talk to me if you want to. Oh, save. All right.
[1543.69s -> 1558.63s]  What do you want to do? Recharge energy. Save the game. Remember card one. Yes, I want to save.
[1560.01s -> 1562.97s]  Do auto voice. You got it. For this character, I will. I promise.
[1566.57s -> 1575.94s]  Tell me. Tell me. What can I help? What can I help you with? Uh, no, I don't need. This is like
[1575.94s -> 1584.60s]  tutorial info. Okay, so, uh, I got a map here. This is a big place. Let's go to the, let's go
[1584.60s -> 1593.90s]  to the market. Let's just go this way. To town. That's a pretty good Minecraft sign.
[1604.28s -> 1619.72s]  What's going on? The police are here. Um, can I? Police? Oh, there they are. What's the matter?
[1622.82s -> 1626.82s]  Well, you certainly put on quite a show. And it looks like everyone's all right.
[1627.46s -> 1645.45s]  Glad to see you're all right after the crash. Okay, bye. Secret. Always check for secrets so
[1645.45s -> 1653.80s]  I can kick trees or something. Do a Trump voice instead. You know, I love how the court of, of,
[1653.80s -> 1661.08s]  of chat's opinion on the Trump voice has increased. Remember when I first did the Trump voice and
[1661.08s -> 1666.70s]  everyone was like, Oh, it's don't, no, no, no. Stephen Colbert does a better job. Did it like
[1666.70s -> 1678.15s]  five or six more times. And now it gets, it gets requested. I want to go down inside the ruins
[1678.15s -> 1686.14s]  to look for some part. Am I too loud? Why do I feel like I'm loud right now? Am I, am I loud?
[1687.64s -> 1697.48s]  No, I'm good. Okay. Fine. Okay. Look for some parts and other stuff. I'm afraid of reaver bots and
[1697.48s -> 1701.48s]  whatever else might be down there. But if I don't find something to sell in my shop,
[1702.04s -> 1712.46s]  I'll be in trouble. Go in it. And why just looking inside? What do you have to say?
[1713.48s -> 1724.14s]  Is this your ship? It shouldn't be here. This is a no parking zone. It ain't mine. This gate's
[1724.14s -> 1735.37s]  malfunctioning. We can't get it to lock. We'd better fix it soon. Were you in the flying machine
[1735.37s -> 1740.09s]  that just crash landed? If so, could you wait until you've spoken with the inspector before
[1740.09s -> 1745.37s]  entering the city? I believe the inspector's gone to investigate the crash site. Didn't I already,
[1745.37s -> 1752.65s]  I don't, I tried. He didn't say anything. What? Oh, here's the little Lego guys.
[1782.07s -> 1796.73s]  Hold on. Why is it so much reverb? That one's loud. Those are tuber voices.
[1799.06s -> 1803.62s]  Come on. If I have, if I have access to it, do you think I'm not going to use it? It sometimes,
[1807.29s -> 1813.13s]  if I have access to, I know, I know that everybody that has one of these does this shit,
[1813.13s -> 1817.85s]  but if it can put a little bit of a robotic tune to my voice, whether there's a robot on the screen,
[1817.85s -> 1822.65s]  like I, I'm going to enhance my volume and my data that I'm putting through to the street.
[1823.45s -> 1830.82s]  Oh, you certainly put on quite a show, but it looks like everyone's on.
[1830.82s -> 1840.97s]  No, how would they do this? All right. Well, talk to me. Isn't this the inspector?
[1840.97s -> 1852.42s]  Talk to the inspector. What the heck? The police saw us crash land and came to check up on us.
[1852.42s -> 1858.10s]  Ramps is the, you certainly put on quite a show. That was close. I was in the same ballpark.
[1859.06s -> 1869.10s]  Let me welcome you to catalogs Island. I'd like to ask one of you to come with me to the station.
[1869.82s -> 1873.13s]  We need you to fill out some Bernie voice for the Bernie voice.
[1874.89s -> 1878.41s]  Can you do anything besides a Bernie voice? You can't enter the city without me.
[1879.37s -> 1888.41s]  Don't worry. It won't take very long while you're waiting. You can spend your time
[1888.41s -> 1894.25s]  in the shopping arcade next to the city. You don't need an ID card to get in there.
[1895.82s -> 1907.58s]  Are you ready to go professor? Go to the arcade? Are you fucking kidding me? How much is the arcade?
[1908.22s -> 1931.82s]  And why is this the best game ever? Ditched. Wait, did they? So wait, me and Roll were left behind.
[1931.82s -> 1948.70s]  So they deemed the save game little monkey character more important than me. I can understand,
[1948.70s -> 1952.78s]  like grandpa, he's the guy, he's the one that has to repair the ship and has to give a police
[1952.78s -> 1969.34s]  report. What's the save monkey doing there? What's this? Oh, that was cool. All right,
[1969.34s -> 1986.74s]  hold on. This is kind of bright. Failure. Taylor. Oh, let's go in. I can put new clothes.
[1987.46s -> 1992.07s]  That customer there spends all his time staring at the mirror and never buys anything.
[1995.93s -> 2002.49s]  Look at me. Am I cool or what? Yes, you are. Yep. Yes. So far the coolest character in the game so
[2002.49s -> 2005.69s]  far. I don't know what this guy's problem is. You should let him stay as long as he wants.
[2006.33s -> 2025.85s]  This is Apple Market, the biggest shopping center on Catalox Island. Why is it called Apple Market?
[2026.57s -> 2032.65s]  See those banners up there? When you want to look up or down, push the directional button while
[2032.65s -> 2043.75s]  holding down the R2 button. It's called the Apple Market because you decided to have banners that
[2043.75s -> 2051.74s]  say apple on them with an apple. Not like this town is known for its apples and farming market.
[2051.74s -> 2059.53s]  No, we just decided it was going to be an apple on a banner. That's interesting. Oh,
[2059.53s -> 2064.18s]  are you one of the people who just crash landed? Want some fruit? How about some fresh vegetables?
[2064.18s -> 2069.38s]  All right, now here we go. Yeah, I do. I want them. Cabbage, mushrooms, carrots. There's a
[2069.38s -> 2076.97s]  lot of vegetables lined up. There are tomatoes, cucumbers, and other vegetables lined up. Where's
[2076.97s -> 2093.80s]  the fucking meat? Where's the meat and cheese? Dressmaker hip bone. There's no apples there.
[2096.33s -> 2102.28s]  Say, you're kind of cute. Your name's Mega Man, isn't it? Well, you're my type of man. I don't
[2102.28s -> 2108.81s]  know if you like looking at women's clothing, but come back and see me anytime. That was a little
[2109.93s -> 2119.99s]  forward. A high welcome to town would have been nice at first. I really like this dress.
[2120.55s -> 2131.18s]  Do you think it would look good on me? Yeah, I mean, sure. Really? Will you buy it for me then?
[2134.86s -> 2140.06s]  Who are these people? Who are you fucking people? No. Oh, don't worry. I was just
[2140.06s -> 2149.54s]  kidding. Hi, Mega Man. Welcome to town. I love you. Okay. Mega Man, do you think this looks good?
[2149.54s -> 2156.44s]  Buy it for me. What the fuck? Who are these two people? Get out of here. They must know I'm famous.
[2157.00s -> 2165.53s]  Like, they think I'm like loaded. Is Mega Man loaded? Probably. Caprica.
[2167.37s -> 2174.22s]  I mean, this is like late Mega Man, right? He's like 22 or 25 or something. Isn't he in this game?
[2174.22s -> 2182.52s]  He's probably got like 10 million in the bank. Have you heard about the ruins just outside the
[2182.52s -> 2189.70s]  gate? You can go inside even if you don't have a digger's license. I hear the junk shop owner
[2189.70s -> 2194.34s]  next door is always going in. They're looking for parts. We have our grind missions. That's pretty
[2194.34s -> 2199.82s]  cool. What do you got here for me? Anybody give any fucking cheddar cheese? My favorite cheese.
[2199.82s -> 2214.09s]  This is my dog, Paprika. He's cute, isn't he? Yeah, he is. That reminds me. I fucking love dogs.
[2215.11s -> 2221.19s]  It's a box. Is there anything inside? There's a refractor shard inside. You found 100 zenny.
[2221.19s -> 2230.23s]  I'm gonna just throw $100 away. Why? It's a garbage pill. There's a refractor shard inside.
[2230.23s -> 2243.56s]  You found 20 zenny. Excuse me. This is my dumpster. Anything inside? It's empty. All right. Um, cool.
[2243.56s -> 2249.62s]  This is a nice little area. Did I not do anything? Wait, there's like, oh, toys. Wait, hold on.
[2250.52s -> 2257.10s]  Yeah, of course. I didn't do the entire right side of the mall. They're trying to fix inflation.
[2257.10s -> 2270.78s]  Leave that shit in the trash. Broken cleaner? What? I think I find items. Who are these people?
[2270.78s -> 2276.14s]  You're looking for the treasure too, aren't you? Just like that girl was here a minute ago.
[2276.14s -> 2283.19s]  Well, I don't know nothing about it. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell a stranger like you.
[2283.19s -> 2289.21s]  By the way, do you think that this vest looks good in these sneakers? Yeah, they do.
[2290.41s -> 2297.29s]  I hear you're loaded. Can you buy them for me? There's been a lot of strangers coming here lately.
[2298.17s -> 2308.31s]  I don't like strangers. Yeah, you don't look like you're from around here either. Go away.
[2308.31s -> 2322.58s]  What if I wasn't here? Record shop? What is this? There's a listening station where you can listen
[2322.58s -> 2330.87s]  to CDs. Can I find CDs and play them? Boy, this song is really good. What OST are you listening to?
[2330.87s -> 2350.15s]  What OST is he listening to? There's a jazz CD on the player. Remember we talked about jazz
[2350.15s -> 2366.66s]  yesterday? In German, not all music is OST, but all music in a video game is an OST because it's
[2366.66s -> 2372.10s]  part of the game's OST. For instance, this song we're listening to right now is on the Mega Man
[2372.10s -> 2386.02s]  Legends OST. I wanted to get a CD, but I didn't have enough money. So I'm just going to listen
[2386.02s -> 2391.53s]  to the samples. Oh my God. I remember this. Holy shit. You guys. All right. Some of you guys that
[2391.53s -> 2395.69s]  are old enough. Do you remember going into the record store, the CD store and being able to
[2395.69s -> 2402.89s]  listen to like an eight second sample of the CD? Wow. They had these headphones that were lined up
[2403.85s -> 2408.25s]  on the cases of the CDs and you could listen to samples. I forgot about that.
[2409.93s -> 2415.21s]  And it was always so stupid. I fucking hated it so much because every time you scanned one to play
[2415.21s -> 2420.97s]  a sample from the album or from a single, it would pick a random spot. It wouldn't play the
[2420.97s -> 2427.51s]  bridge or the chorus, but you'd have an insanely famous song and it would play like in the middle
[2427.51s -> 2434.31s]  of the second verse. It's like, I want to fucking give me the chorus. Not that
[2434.39s -> 2442.10s]  what are you doing? You caught me right in the middle of your second verse. That's not what I
[2442.10s -> 2450.44s]  wanted to hear. That's a bad sample. Be sure to listen to our sample CDs before you leave.
[2450.44s -> 2464.78s]  All right. Where's the arcade? I'll spend an hour walking around here. I don't care. I love this.
[2465.42s -> 2470.78s]  Electronic goods store. It's an electronic shop, but the junk store probably has a better selection
[2470.78s -> 2485.03s]  of parts. Yeah, but what's in it though? 50% off a TV. Can I buy this stuff? It's a TV, but it's too
[2485.03s -> 2495.11s]  big to carry home. That's not too big to carry home. What? You can definitely. All right. If you
[2495.11s -> 2500.89s]  can carry a 24 pack of water to your car, you can carry that to your car. Mega Man, please.
[2501.53s -> 2514.78s]  What else is in here? It's a VCR, but you don't need one. I already got one. Oh, it's a Tesla
[2514.78s -> 2526.47s]  fridge. It's a refrigerator. What do you do? Parts for a flying ship. You're better off looking at
[2526.47s -> 2536.04s]  the junk store. All this stuff in here is junk. Everything's 50% off. You got nothing full priced
[2536.04s -> 2543.21s]  in here, man. You're selling an old fridge for like 30% off. Here you break. Toy store. Yep.
[2543.21s -> 2548.28s]  This is that new game called Mega Man Legends. It looks pretty interesting.
[2549.90s -> 2569.99s]  Can I play the game within the game? All right. Junk shop. Where's the arcade? Ego Mania Mania. Oh,
[2569.99s -> 2576.12s]  man. This is not even. All right. This is a lost and found. This is not even a junk shop.
[2579.38s -> 2584.66s]  Junk shop lady. Parts for your ship. I'm sorry, but my husband's out on a dig right now.
[2584.66s -> 2589.32s]  You know what a dig is, right? It's where you go underground looking for old machine parts.
[2590.20s -> 2596.36s]  That's condescending. I wonder what's taking him so long. Hey, little blue boy. Would you be willing
[2596.36s -> 2602.36s]  to go find him for me? Yeah, sure. You will? Oh, thank you so much. You'll probably find him
[2602.36s -> 2607.62s]  somewhere near the entrance. He's really just a big coward, you see. So I don't think he's gone too
[2607.62s -> 2617.90s]  far in. What do you have here? He's 100% dead. It's a stuffed re-robot. It's an old family heirloom.
[2617.90s -> 2635.13s]  We call it Rover. Let's go find the junk guy. All right. No arcade? Where's the arcade? Look at
[2635.13s -> 2642.97s]  how happy the dog is. Oh, I know somebody that like just got out of the bath. You just took a bath.
[2644.09s -> 2648.26s]  Yep. The only difference is you're not like rolling around on your back and going.
[2648.82s -> 2666.60s]  All right. So we need to go to the. All right. Let's get out of here. Can I throw this away?
[2673.27s -> 2681.77s]  Can I open the garbage and throw it away? Wait, there's 50 dollars in here. All right. Kick it in
[2681.77s -> 2698.68s]  in the basket. No, whatever. I love the way this is. Look at this. Bang! Bang! I love it. I just saw
[2698.68s -> 2703.24s]  an older man go inside those ruins over there. I wonder if he'll be all right. If you want to
[2703.24s -> 2710.17s]  go check on him, you should probably save first. If you want to save, just talk to me, okay? Okay.
[2710.97s -> 2728.82s]  I forgot. I know I forgot. The man of five voices. He can go like this. He can go like this.
[2729.88s -> 2740.54s]  He can go like this. He can go like this. The man of five voices. All right. The ruins. Let's go
[2740.54s -> 2758.74s]  in the ruins. Where are the ruins? The ruins over there. Over here? This isn't the guy's store.
[2759.46s -> 2782.22s]  I thought this was the guy's store. Oh, man's voice. Help. Somebody help. Dungeon time. Look
[2782.22s -> 2805.86s]  at the parts too. I need junk parts. Oh, easy. Can I move when I'm locked on? I can't move when
[2805.86s -> 2824.33s]  I'm locked on, huh? All right. Let's get this money. All right. So if I move... Okay. I can't
[2824.33s -> 2833.05s]  move left and right. Is it like a dodge or like a... That's kick. Part two. Left, up, down. No. No.
[2833.05s -> 2860.50s]  How do I do that dodge? Why am I playing the worst Mega Man? What? What? What? Hold on. Dude,
[2860.50s -> 2867.67s]  that's like I'm eating my favorite spaghetti dish in my favorite restaurant. And you walk up
[2867.67s -> 2872.31s]  as somebody that's never been to the restaurant before. Or maybe you have and you don't like it,
[2872.31s -> 2875.67s]  but you tap me on the shoulder and go, hey, the spaghetti here sucks. It's the worst. The meat
[2875.67s -> 2879.19s]  sauce is terrible. In fact, I think there's rats in the kitchen and then you leave.
[2880.39s -> 2893.82s]  What? Help me. Where is this guy? There's got to be a way I can do that dodge.
[2901.86s -> 2927.26s]  Yikes. I'll take the range. Oh, fuck. Can I only get that dodge roll if I do the other control
[2927.26s -> 2962.49s]  scheme? R1 plus X. Ah, yes. Yes. Yes. Look at how much better this is. Does that help? Oh my.
[2965.05s -> 2983.16s]  Apologize for what? I just airstropped that guy. What? What am I apologizing for? What did I do?
[2983.16s -> 2997.94s]  I didn't do anything. There is just a secret. Don't worry. I ain't going anywhere.
[3004.46s -> 3014.94s]  Thanks. You saved my life. Phew. Thank you. Ah, Mr. Blue boy. Come on by my junk shop.
[3014.94s -> 3019.85s]  I'll give you some thing as a token of my appreciation. If you don't know what you did,
[3019.85s -> 3026.68s]  it's worse. Is this about the like, yes thing? Don't worry about me. If nothing else, I'm a
[3026.68s -> 3040.07s]  fast runner and I'll make it out okay. I ain't saying sorry. I ain't saying sorry for that one.
[3040.95s -> 3049.80s]  Not going to happen. Let's go get secrets. He didn't do anything wrong. Yeah. What did I do
[3049.80s -> 3070.33s]  that was wrong? Oh no. Minus two. Unbased streamer. Unbased. I got to find, let's look,
[3070.33s -> 3093.16s]  I got to look for some secrets. Any secrets? Secret. There's a hole in the wall. Is there
[3093.16s -> 3097.80s]  anything inside? You found a refractor shard. You got 20. That's a lot of money.
[3098.44s -> 3114.18s]  It looks like a binding of an Isaac. I got to get up there. How do I get up there? Like is there like
[3115.14s -> 3118.98s]  zoom shoes? Zoomer shoes or something? Like jump shoes?
[3121.62s -> 3130.58s]  I don't think I can get up there. All right. Well, let's go with the actual exit.
[3132.10s -> 3154.58s]  I got money now. Boss? Oh, wait, hold on. Easy. Oh, it's the classic Mega Man villain. I'm not
[3154.58s -> 3157.94s]  going to do anything until you get too close and then I'm going to come up and I'm going to have
[3158.74s -> 3172.20s]  Oh my god. Did I get the money?
[3183.21s -> 3191.05s]  Nice. Wait, what's that? Nothing. The sound design is dope. Yeah, it actually is pretty good.
[3192.57s -> 3214.33s]  Is it going to blow stuff up? Ow. That hurt. Hitbox fucking hitbox reddit, whatever it is.
[3215.61s -> 3235.83s]  Is there only one guy in here? No, there's two. Be careful. This is a tough room. Does that guy
[3235.83s -> 3251.67s]  move? All right, let's let's get this cheesed. Okay, that's done. Now just get in. Let's fight.
[3261.91s -> 3286.60s]  Don't stop saying reddit shit. Unbased. Oh, that was a good chest move he predicted. He just
[3286.60s -> 3313.51s]  walked into the wall though. Big money. Zero out of ten. Unbased. Oh yeah. Rapid fire. Rapid
[3313.51s -> 3317.51s]  fire is a Mega Man buster part. Attaching buster parts allows you to power up your weapons.
[3318.15s -> 3321.99s]  You can attach buster parts by pressing the start button to go to the menu screen and selecting
[3321.99s -> 3329.30s]  equip from the buster parts menu. I think I stayed in here. So I'm gonna have two on. Equip
[3329.30s -> 3335.86s]  up. Rapid fire increases rapid. They can have two parts on at the same time. So I have.
[3336.90s -> 3352.04s]  Let's take a look. How much better is it? A little better. Oh, we'll test it on you.
[3353.08s -> 3366.26s]  You can get at least three. Yeah, eventually probably. I don't remember much from the game.
[3367.46s -> 3371.62s]  Besides, that was good that I got. All right, anything else in here? No. Leave the ruins.
[3372.58s -> 3378.86s]  You can strafe while locked on. You cannot. You cannot. I believe that is somebody said that is
[3378.86s -> 3393.80s]  only in Mega Man Legends 2. Yes, you can. Are you sure that's not a suit upgrade or something I get
[3393.80s -> 3424.06s]  later? It was. It was. They were. They're jaking you. Did you bait? Oh, big door. There's a wall
[3424.06s -> 3434.49s]  in the way. Maybe if you had something to break through it with. Worth a shot. All right, I got
[3434.49s -> 3440.26s]  money and I just rescued the guy. So what else is it? Nothing. Nothing. I can't get up there.
[3442.82s -> 3466.76s]  Come on. No. Mega small. Is German in a space cam is on? What the fuck, dude? Use the ladder?
[3466.76s -> 3493.93s]  We would ladder. In the other room? Wait, what am I getting lied to? Ladder in the first room.
[3494.65s -> 3511.64s]  Oh, that's a ladder. Oh, that's a ladder. I thought that was just cool artwork on that. I didn't know
[3511.64s -> 3519.32s]  that was a ladder. It was like, all right, here we go. I'm back. Hey, look at this. It looks like
[3519.32s -> 3529.98s]  Spotter's car. I wonder if it would run if we would fix it up. Probably. I hear you helped out
[3529.98s -> 3534.54s]  with the junk store owner. He says he wants to thank you. So you should stop by his store later.
[3535.42s -> 3553.00s]  Good job. This dude is just vibing. Yeah. He hates the auto voice. No, I will. I just keep forgetting.
[3553.80s -> 3590.71s]  Back to the junk store. Wait, another person here? Where do I kick this? Somebody said behind the
[3590.71s -> 3599.42s]  counter. Behind the bakery counter? Is that real? All right, I'm gonna go for it. Get it behind the
[3599.42s -> 3626.31s]  bakery counter. Well, you must really hate this place. You look like a Slytherin. Yes, I know.
[3627.03s -> 3631.27s]  I know. I look like a Slytherin. And if I tell you I'm Slytherin, that means I'm actually Hufflepuff.
[3631.99s -> 3635.91s]  And if I get Hufflepuff on a test, it means I'm actually Slytherin in real life.
[3636.71s -> 3649.24s]  That's how this works. Got it. Nice shot. Thousands, any. Keep our streets clean. Put
[3649.24s -> 3668.95s]  trash in its proper place. All right. Junk store. I mean, in the bakery. Wait, what? Bakery is
[3669.51s -> 3675.59s]  behind the bakery counter. Our trash belongs in the bakery. What the fuck? Fuck the bakery. What
[3675.59s -> 3688.89s]  are you guys doing? Oh, you came back. The bakery has aggressive energy. Were you surprised I came
[3688.89s -> 3694.68s]  back? I'm here for my reward actually. Oh shit, I didn't think you'd be back. Thank you so much. I
[3694.68s -> 3700.97s]  don't know what I would have happened if you hadn't gone looking for junk store man. Ha ha ha ha ha.
[3701.69s -> 3707.38s]  Thanks for helping me out back there. Here, take this as a reward. You got mine parts kit.
[3708.26s -> 3714.52s]  Did you see that old beat up car outside the city walls? That's the car we used as our support car
[3715.66s -> 3721.03s]  when we were younger. Anyway, you can have it if you want. It doesn't run anymore, but you should
[3721.03s -> 3728.79s]  be able to use it to exchange buster parts and stuff. Like storage. It's a stash. You're looking
[3728.79s -> 3733.59s]  for parts for your ship, right? No, I don't have anything like that here, but I've got weapons and
[3733.59s -> 3738.39s]  upgrades and other stuff I can sell you. Why? Why are you the store that has all this stuff?
[3740.26s -> 3748.30s]  What did you say your name was? My name is Hippopotamus. Hippopotamus? What kind of name is
[3748.30s -> 3766.15s]  that? Well, anyway, come back soon, Mr. Hippopotamus. Only you guys know. Oh, I was the
[3766.15s -> 3779.67s]  digger and he was my spotter. I'm back to buy something. Parts for a flying ship. I want to
[3779.67s -> 3788.92s]  buy. Do you want me to come back and buy something? If you got a Class B digger's license, you can get
[3788.92s -> 3796.50s]  into the ruins in the southern forest or the one up the north in the closer woods. All right. Well,
[3796.50s -> 3808.94s]  thanks for nothing. They were just being polite. Hey, slow. No running. No running. You're going to
[3808.94s -> 3813.10s]  slip and fall in the pool. You know, what it is around the edges. God, people just don't ever
[3813.10s -> 3822.70s]  fucking understand that rule. Who are you? Are you a digger? I'm here going doing research on the
[3822.70s -> 3830.94s]  ruins of this island here. Sure. A lot of them aren't there. That's what I used to go. They were
[3830.94s -> 3849.05s]  just being polite. They usually don't have any stuff here. Well, OK. Come on up north. Thanks
[3849.05s -> 3861.26s]  for nothing. Drunk shop. That's the stuff. Yeah. OK, goodbye. We sell parts and upgrades and armor.
[3861.26s -> 3885.94s]  Come back. Whatever. All right. Now let's go turn that car on. I've got parts. Do you need to do it?
[3886.58s -> 3896.07s]  Mega man, were you able to find anything? Voice acting. If you can't find any parts in town,
[3896.97s -> 3902.10s]  I guess we'll have to try digging for them ourselves. That's what the man at the junk
[3902.10s -> 3912.65s]  store said. That might take a while, which means. I don't know if. Mega man, what's that? That's
[3912.65s -> 3918.81s]  what the man at the junk store told me. His info you should really go off of for much. Yeah. The
[3918.81s -> 3926.41s]  junk store man gave it to me. He said we could use this car to hook it up. Mega man. You mean
[3926.41s -> 3933.05s]  we can use this car? Well, come on then. Junk store man. He's really putting a lot of weight on
[3933.05s -> 3938.97s]  the junk store man's stuff in the things he says. Have you talked to the mayor yet? It's ready.
[3938.97s -> 3948.46s]  This weapon lets you use landmines. Just drop them in front of an oncoming enemy. And just remember,
[3948.46s -> 3952.62s]  there's a limited number of mines, so make sure you use them sparingly.
[3953.26s -> 3959.70s]  Do you want me to explain what this weapon does again? I'll get to work on fixing this car up.
[3960.66s -> 3964.58s]  I'll be able to help you out and maybe spot for you if I can get it running again.
[3968.22s -> 3974.22s]  Item development. Once the support car is fixed, I'll be able to use it to make all sorts of new
[3974.22s -> 3978.70s]  things. If you find something interesting, bring it here. You never know what I might be able to
[3978.70s -> 3981.74s]  make for you. All right. That's it. Yeah. We get like a mobile development.
[3991.99s -> 3998.50s]  More stuff to give. Wow. I only had to walk around for 10 minutes.
[4007.91s -> 4008.63s]  Citizenship.
[4018.34s -> 4025.94s]  And locking the gates evacuating. Our grandfather is still inside the city.
[4026.66s -> 4033.10s]  Will he be all right? Well, I'm sure he's heard the announcements about the pirates.
[4033.10s -> 4045.05s]  Oh, that's that's not. Yes. That's not. Yes. If you'll excuse me, I'm worried about grants.
[4046.20s -> 4052.86s]  I hope he'll be OK. I'll go look for him. You wait here. We're evacuating the city.
[4060.73s -> 4066.97s]  Pirates, eh? Well, they shouldn't give you any trouble. But be careful anyway, OK? I did it.
[4068.89s -> 4091.32s]  I did it. I did it. That was perfect. I thought this was a Canadian forest. Let's go. So I have
[4091.88s -> 4096.12s]  my citizen's key card now. It doesn't look like much of an evacuation.
[4104.76s -> 4106.84s]  Hey, we're having a secret meeting. Get out of here.
[4108.73s -> 4115.30s]  If I'm careful, I should be able to get close without them noticing. You can move slowly by
[4115.30s -> 4129.61s]  pressing circle and the directional button at the same time. Is this sneaking or is this
[4130.25s -> 4138.06s]  more pronounced than what I was just doing? That's like the get the fuck out of my way walk.
[4138.06s -> 4141.26s]  Whisper, whisper. That girl looks suspicious, I tell you.
[4144.82s -> 4148.95s]  She has to be a pirate. She said she was looking for treasure.
[4151.32s -> 4155.82s]  No one believes us. We're going to have to get her ourselves. Hey, someone's spying on us.
[4156.46s -> 4179.94s]  It's that blue guy again. Come on, everybody. Let's go. OK, got it. Once the decision's made,
[4179.94s -> 4186.42s]  there's no turning back. The pirate. Nothing less than 100 percent. And remember, it's more than
[4186.42s -> 4192.50s]  just guns and ships. Holy shit. It's whoever has the most information that wins, right?
[4192.50s -> 4201.35s]  That's what they got the entire idea from. We understand. Keep your costs as low as possible
[4201.35s -> 4208.33s]  and stay on schedule. And they just scrambled all the dialogue so they can just localize it
[4208.33s -> 4224.95s]  for free everywhere. Holy shit. Genius. Wait, that's me? I thought I was a camera.
[4230.94s -> 4245.72s]  Wait, you just drew. Hey, pay attention. I was in a fucking crosswalk. There's nobody driving
[4245.72s -> 4255.91s]  these cars. Kick mailbox. Kick mailbox. It's a mailbox, but you don't need to send any letters.
[4256.55s -> 4266.82s]  I bet you the cop does it too. Do they crash into each other? Uh oh, big school bus. Haven't you
[4266.82s -> 4272.34s]  heard about the pirates? Everyone in town's evacuating. You'd be small. OK, that's why
[4273.14s -> 4288.86s]  everyone's getting fucked up. I get it. I know everyone's afraid and wants to get away,
[4288.86s -> 4293.50s]  but they should be more careful when they drive. You better watch out too and make
[4293.50s -> 4308.09s]  sure you don't get run over. I know. Oh my god. It's a fire hydrant. You could probably jump on
[4308.09s -> 4330.73s]  top of it. OK, and why did I do that? Garbage pail. Is there anything inside? No. Achievement.
[4330.73s -> 4344.33s]  In the back of the guest truck. Yes. Nice. Ice cream. Vending machine. Do you want to put a
[4344.33s -> 4361.00s]  hundred zenny in? Yes. You got a soft drink. Pretty good cat puke sound. Nice. You got a soft drink
[4361.00s -> 4385.27s]  for free. One more. Hey guys. I love it. Thief. It's quiet inside. Looks like everyone's evacuated.
[4385.27s -> 4403.30s]  All right, let's go. This is a plant. Nice bitrate, idiot. What? Oh, that's all right. Nice. Cool.
[4414.49s -> 4423.53s]  Um, wait, no. Mega Man, look out for that car. Mega Man, watch out for the car. The audio is
[4423.53s -> 4429.22s]  desynced on me or on the game? Because I could probably fix it. What are you? Is it me desynced?
[4429.22s -> 4450.97s]  We'll do a test. Ready? Ready? Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. It's fine. The bus stops, actually.
[4452.09s -> 4460.98s]  Really good driver. Thank you. Smartest person in the game. Look at that. What about you? Test
[4460.98s -> 4477.48s]  number two. No. He just saw. He just saw the bus stop. What? I just went down to the sewer?
[4477.48s -> 4482.04s]  Oh, nice. All right. Like dungeon. Let's go. Why didn't it just say it like that? Dungeon.
[4497.08s -> 4510.52s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is just. Oh, okay. This is where it was before. It's all
[4510.52s -> 4525.48s]  connected. Can I do anything in here? This game's kind of like Doxels. Yeah, kind of, kid.
[4539.80s -> 4554.39s]  Oh, enemy. I can't fire right now. Police. Fire it. Huh? What do you want? You've been following
[4554.55s -> 4558.55s]  me all around all day, haven't you? Sorry, but I don't have time to play with you.
[4559.19s -> 4572.07s]  Just stay out of my way. Okay. Oh, don't you know that all civilians are supposed to be evacuated?
[4572.63s -> 4576.95s]  You just like that girl over there. Don't you know you're supposed to do what adults tell you to do?
[4577.67s -> 4593.91s]  I thought he was going to walk into the road and get like clipped. This is really bright.
[4598.09s -> 4600.57s]  It's a fountain. Watching it makes you feel very relaxed.
[4602.74s -> 4611.16s]  Unanimated electricity. Wouldn't this kill me? I've got like 400 pounds of electricity on me.
[4613.45s -> 4627.16s]  The bank. There's a bank. The pirates aren't coming, are they? Please say they're not. ATM?
[4627.96s -> 4632.12s]  It's an automated teller machine, but you can't use it. You don't have any money in the bank.
[4632.76s -> 4637.22s]  Well, let's go. Let's open up an account. It's getting too dangerous here.
[4637.22s -> 4641.80s]  I'm thinking that maybe we should shut down temporarily. This is the bank.
[4641.80s -> 4645.08s]  Completing on evacuating. Please be sure to withdraw money first.
[4646.04s -> 4649.88s]  No, don't tell everyone to withdraw their money first. That's how you crash the whole economy.
[4650.60s -> 4656.31s]  The desk filling up forms. Pens are attached to the desk by a chain.
[4657.03s -> 4666.82s]  It's a comfortable looking sofa. I figured that since I was evacuating,
[4666.82s -> 4672.34s]  I should withdraw my money from my account, but I forgot I only have 980 zenny in the bank.
[4673.14s -> 4684.07s]  Why are you telling me how much money you have? Wait, you can't take it out?
[4684.71s -> 4693.53s]  All right. At that point, I'm going to be like, all right, hey, dude, here's a 20.
[4694.09s -> 4708.04s]  Just put it in and then take it out. Have a nice day. What? Knock, knock. Looks like nobody's home.
[4708.60s -> 4731.14s]  The legendary mega... Yeah. No, what's on the other side of this gate? The Yas Plains. The Yas
[4731.70s -> 4737.62s]  Plains. That's what. Right now, it's full of people who've evacuated from the city,
[4737.62s -> 4760.46s]  so it's a little crowded. Oh, chat, chat. What are you going to say about that one? I wonder.
[4761.50s -> 4772.28s]  Dermot, this fucking music never ends. It's just standard default background. You're in town music.
[4774.20s -> 4789.74s]  All right. City hall. Let's go to city hall. Is there anything else up here that I need to do
[4789.74s -> 4816.41s]  that I didn't do? That's my favorite part. It's coming up right now. We got city hall, downtown.
[4816.41s -> 4825.69s]  So where should I be going? Pirates are attacking. Where are the pirates attacking from?
[4829.05s -> 4850.62s]  You're such a fucking elf. Big building. Police. Let's go to police station. Holy shit, this game
[4850.62s -> 4859.24s]  looks like shit. This game came out before you were born, probably. This game came out before you were
[4859.24s -> 4875.05s]  even alive. It looks different from the ones in the downtown area. This game came out in like 1998.
[4875.05s -> 4888.42s]  You were born in 1999. It looks pretty good if we're coming out in 1999. I'm not here to
[4889.62s -> 4900.82s]  spy. No, not me. With these pirates running around, I'm glad we have such a well-trained
[4900.82s -> 4907.22s]  police force. To the news. It's a newspaper. Let's see what it says. Flying ship crashes in
[4907.22s -> 4914.09s]  forest. No injuries reported. That's the last article. Not much happens here. No matter how
[4914.09s -> 4921.30s]  brave those pirates might be, they wouldn't attack the police station. Would they? I don't know.
[4921.30s -> 4926.44s]  Turns out your grandfather, Professor Barrell, is an old friend of the mayor's. I didn't know
[4926.44s -> 4934.17s]  he was such a renowned archaeologist. The cat is getting toxic and we have sub-only mode. Turn it on.
[4934.89s -> 4945.78s]  Turn it on. Our job as police officers is to serve and protect the people of Catalogues Island.
[4956.10s -> 4961.66s]  Only authorized personnel are allowed inside the office. Don't I have a citizen card for this shit?
[4962.46s -> 4980.09s]  Oh, they're cheating. They're using only authorized chat only. Or you gotta pay channel points.
[4981.82s -> 4995.43s]  Oh man. City hall? Is this a church or is this city hall? This is a church. Uh oh. Sorry, no
[4995.43s -> 5004.74s]  unauthorized entry allowed. Do you have a business here? Sub-only mode is meaningless. He's in a
[5004.74s -> 5010.89s]  meeting with the mayor. Please wait one minute. All right, turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.
[5010.89s -> 5015.05s]  Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. No, no, keep it on. Keep it on.
[5015.05s -> 5018.57s]  Keep it on. Make him waste all their points so I don't have to wink. Keep it on. Keep it on. Make
[5018.57s -> 5032.25s]  him waste all their points so I don't have to wink ever again. Hey, Mega Man! Yes. Here, let me
[5032.25s -> 5041.80s]  introduce you to the mayor of this island, Amelia. Amelia, nice to meet you. I'm an old friend of
[5041.80s -> 5051.22s]  Professor Barrell's. I worked as his assistant for a while. While I was in school. I don't have a
[5051.22s -> 5056.90s]  fucking backpack on. To tell you the truth, we've gotten reports that-
[5056.90s -> 5060.50s]  Keep it on. Keep it on. Make him waste all their fucking points. I was asking the professor if he
[5060.50s -> 5069.56s]  might have any idea what they're after. Anything thereafter the legend supposedly buried on this
[5069.56s -> 5078.12s]  island. There are a lot of stories about the treasure. Knows exactly what it is. I thought
[5078.12s -> 5083.96s]  maybe you might know something about it, professor. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. That's a pretty sick
[5083.96s -> 5090.04s]  creamsicle hair. But I haven't been able to find out anything about this island. I strive for that
[5090.04s -> 5096.54s]  every day. Except legends and myths. Fuck, Mega Man. I'll be here for a while talking with Amelia.
[5097.34s -> 5103.66s]  So why don't you go back and keep an eye on her? Tell her not to worry about me, okay?
[5103.66s -> 5108.46s]  Thanks to the five community subs at the Starfish. Congratulations to the winners.
[5108.46s -> 5117.21s]  What do you have to say? Sub only is useless. I know. Or, I mean, is it? This is a-
[5117.77s -> 5125.24s]  This is my equivalent to World of Warcraft letting you level up to 60 for like $5 or $10,
[5125.24s -> 5131.75s]  whatever it was. Wow, that ruined the whole game, didn't it? Holy shit. You could- You can buy-
[5132.47s -> 5138.23s]  You can pay like $10 and just level the fuck up to max level with a new character.
[5140.55s -> 5144.95s]  Holy shit. I forgot about that. What did they want me to do? I was- I was paying attention to the
[5145.75s -> 5152.47s]  tyrant that I am. Very Treasured is the legend that says it- that says if the seals are broken,
[5152.47s -> 5157.03s]  a terrible disaster will occur. Even if it's only a legend as mayor of this island,
[5157.03s -> 5165.80s]  I can't ignore anything that might threaten it. I'm going to stay here and talk with Amelia.
[5165.80s -> 5172.74s]  You take care of Role in case those pirates show up. All right, is it like any money in the desk?
[5174.10s -> 5182.06s]  Why is the chat sub only? It's a 9- 100 million IQ play to make people waste all their fucking
[5182.06s -> 5189.99s]  points and it's working. You're from out of town, aren't you? Are you a digger? Don't worry,
[5189.99s -> 5195.19s]  everyone here is very friendly. You may not know your way around yet, but you'll find that you'll
[5195.19s -> 5201.64s]  get along just fine. I don't have any problem. All right, I'm probably gonna get- I'm gonna get
[5201.64s -> 5215.00s]  cutscenes here in a second, aren't I? Yeah, here comes a cutscene. I'm like, what do you mean it's
[5215.00s -> 5243.51s]  a dog? Who is- am I pretending to be them or are they pretending to be me with the kind of
[5243.51s -> 5247.99s]  stretching up on the toes thing? Do I see the adults doing that? And I'm like, yeah, I did that
[5247.99s -> 5269.59s]  too. I don't know. Wow, he was trying to hit me. All right, um, let's go back. He went around.
[5269.59s -> 5275.69s]  He circled back. Hey, Frank, we didn't hit that fucking kid, did we? No, no, no, no, we didn't.
[5276.49s -> 5284.74s]  Turn around and fucking drill them. But it's true, officer. My paprika found a suspicious
[5284.74s -> 5293.90s]  looking girl. She must be a pirate. Please come here to check things out. I'm sure of it.
[5293.90s -> 5314.20s]  Okay, bye. We sell stuff only on- nice, keep it on. What's going on over here? What did you do to
[5314.20s -> 5330.89s]  upset my dog? What? What do you got? You got like- what are you- what are you- well, what are you
[5330.89s -> 5344.98s]  doing? I need to get like a bone or something. All right, well, should I say stop? Did I give
[5344.98s -> 5359.46s]  food to dog? You don't understand. I'll translate.
[5379.85s -> 5382.81s]  No, he didn't say anything after that. That was it. He just wanted to tell Megaman that he was hungry.
[5394.44s -> 5400.46s]  Holy shit. That was one of the worms from like a worm's armageddon. That's what they- that's what
[5400.46s -> 5403.74s]  they look like. I was trying to figure it out for the longest time. I haven't said anything yet.
[5405.59s -> 5410.65s]  But they have- they have worms faces. I was like, what the fuck do they look like?
[5411.29s -> 5421.98s]  I'm like the worms franchise. Sub chat is worse. All right, turn it off. Turn it off.
[5421.98s -> 5433.26s]  Break- like sub chat is worse. Turn it off. It's a junk store. No, I want to talk to this person.
[5433.26s -> 5440.87s]  Hey hippopotamus, what's up? We're always open for business no matter what. If we can do anything
[5440.87s -> 5451.06s]  for you, just ask. All right, now does that mean I can buy something? Yep. Ooh, 8,480
[5452.02s -> 5460.90s]  time currency. Whatever that is. All right, buy parts. Power razor. Ooh, range booster. Turbo
[5460.90s -> 5470.18s]  charger. Dude, I could get double power booster. Double power booster, I think I want to do.
[5472.65s -> 5490.65s]  Real wink. Why does it do that? All right, I'm doing double power booster. Give it to me. Power
[5490.65s -> 5501.78s]  booster. What about items? Life gauge. Adds one point to life gauge. What? Yeah. Ooh, I could do
[5501.78s -> 5509.16s]  that. Another one? Repairs damage- repairs damage to life shield. Used to restore life gauge. Can
[5509.16s -> 5519.91s]  be refilled. All right, no, the energy canteen. Extra pack adds points to the canteen. All right,
[5519.91s -> 5528.71s]  I don't want to use all my money. I'll get one more point to the life gauge though. Fuck. Shield
[5528.79s -> 5536.76s]  repairs damage to life shield. Adds points to get another canteen. Oh, god damn it. Another one.
[5539.22s -> 5548.49s]  God damn it. One more. And another one. Shield repair. Life gauge. Done. All right, let's get
[5548.49s -> 5558.95s]  up. Refill the canteen. All right, what about sell? Parts. All right, so. All right, hold on a minute
[5558.95s -> 5570.66s]  here. Sell this shitty power razor and equip the new one and keep the rapid fire on. Life gauge is
[5570.66s -> 5577.40s]  goodbye. Yeah. You get money so easily, don't sell it. No point in selling. It's not even any- oh.
[5580.73s -> 5587.54s]  Cool. Look at that. Look at that life. Nice. All right, let me, uh. Bust the parts. Equip.
[5588.18s -> 5594.10s]  Should I- all right. Power razor. Double power razor and just have a ton of attack? Or should I
[5594.10s -> 5602.36s]  cap- I think I'm going to keep that on for now. Double power. The rapid fire is not that fast.
[5608.30s -> 5611.10s]  Each person that says this game sucks, I'd like for you to delete their account.
[5611.82s -> 5638.33s]  You guys have dedicated mods. Can you do that? Mods. Mods. Mods. Mods. What do they sound like?
[5638.33s -> 5644.01s]  Omega. Omega man. Omega lol.
[5648.25s -> 5655.61s]  What? He's talking with the mayor at city hall. I hope he'll be okay. Did you see those weird
[5655.61s -> 5663.00s]  looking ships that just flew past here? I've never seen ones like that before. I wonder whose they are.
[5670.44s -> 5674.60s]  There goes one. No. Roll. That's just- that was just a projection.
[5675.56s -> 5691.62s]  Oh, there goes one. Uh. The fence is still in there.
[5694.01s -> 5696.49s]  Mega man, I'm going to go make sure he's all right.
[5701.26s -> 5715.21s]  I haven't eaten all day. You want the carrots in here? I'm useless unless I fucking eat. All right,
[5715.21s -> 5728.50s]  let's go. There's birds that are louder than the war going on in the city. Roll, hold on. Oh shit.
[5728.50s -> 5747.91s]  I'm sorry. I'm obsessive. Holy shit. This song. Oh my god. I- okay. This is where that song is from.
[5747.99s -> 5756.84s]  I- I tried to remember what this was and I'm not even talking about recently. I'm talking about
[5756.84s -> 5763.03s]  like two or three years ago. This. I was like what the fuck is that from? I hum it all the time.
[5763.83s -> 5772.18s]  You know when something just like snaps into your brain like that and you realize how much you cared
[5772.90s -> 5776.98s]  two or three years ago and now you just don't at all and you're like wow why did I care that much?
[5776.98s -> 5793.24s]  But cool. Now that I'm glad I know this. Yeah, this is the before the boss.
[5799.66s -> 5803.10s]  Oh my god. This is night. This is my I've had nightmares with this music in it and I've tried
[5803.10s -> 5809.83s]  to figure out what the fuck it was. That's what I know. That's what's going on. I've had nightmares
[5810.55s -> 5818.44s]  like we could fucked up dreams with this song was play in the background slower and like the
[5818.44s -> 5837.61s]  tempo was just decreased. Holy shit. This is fucking messed up like slower like oh my god.
[5837.61s -> 5843.05s]  This is insane. I forgot. This is kind of like I'm gonna have to like go.
[5854.58s -> 5865.14s]  Hold it right there. You can't go in there. This area is closed off. Please officer let us through.
[5865.14s -> 5875.05s]  And father's in there. You can't go in either. It's dangerous. How about this? We arm wrestle
[5875.05s -> 5880.26s]  and if I win in less than a tenth of a second I get to go in. Those pirates have attacked the
[5880.26s -> 5886.14s]  island. We'll find out. Just like they said they would. They're after the treasure that's supposed
[5886.14s -> 5897.06s]  to be buried here. Enough talk. You have to leave here now. Pirates. They've occupied the gate over
[5897.06s -> 5904.70s]  there. I'll take care of it. They're too heavily armed. We can't even get close to them. I can.
[5904.70s -> 5914.86s]  Maybe I can do something. Mega man I'm going with you. No role is too dangerous. Let me handle this.
[5918.89s -> 5928.02s]  All right you look out for gramps okay. Wait are you crazy? Wait where do you think you're going?
[5928.02s -> 5936.34s]  He didn't hear that. He was gone. The two different cops there. One cared one didn't at all.
[5937.46s -> 5954.38s]  But had to make it sound like he did in case he was somebody was around to witness it. I thought
[5954.38s -> 5974.01s]  it was bone. It's not trombone. It's tron bon. Why would it be bon? Why wouldn't it be trombone?
[5974.25s -> 5982.74s]  That is way more tron bon. No tron bon. Like a tron bon. Get the key to the gate. One of the three
[5982.74s -> 5986.10s]  serp bots has the key. They can pass it back and forth between them so you'll have to figure out
[5986.10s -> 5992.22s]  which one of them has it. Each of the three serp bots robots is unique and has different capabilities.
[5992.22s -> 5996.54s]  Red is built for combat. Blue is built for speed. And yellow is built for endurance.
[5997.50s -> 6002.97s]  Mission start. Oh that hurt.
[6010.07s -> 6019.78s]  Dodge. Where's the key? All right let's go for yellow. I'll go I'll go for blue.
[6020.98s -> 6053.08s]  Kill blue first. Blue's got speed. All right key. Thanks for the key. Mission complete.
[6053.08s -> 6057.61s]  Let me hook it. That was a first try. Easy. Okay I want to pick up the money.
[6063.21s -> 6075.30s]  Time. I can't take my eyes off you for a second can I? Just you wait till we get back. You're
[6075.30s -> 6086.20s]  in a lot of trouble. Oh no. What was that? Wasn't that the same boy as before?
[6086.76s -> 6096.58s]  He disabled the bloom bears by himself. I don't understand. Whenever I think about him I get this
[6096.58s -> 6106.54s]  funny feeling. Oh forget it. Who cares what this feeling is? It's all his fault. His fault.
[6107.02s -> 6112.06s]  How dare he? Does she like me? I'll teach him not to mess with me or my kids.
[6112.94s -> 6120.36s]  Here we go. Those are your kids? I thought you built them in a factory or something.
[6120.36s -> 6138.60s]  Thanks to you everything's a mess now isn't it? Aren't you the girl who's being chased by that dog?
[6139.56s -> 6144.36s]  Shut up. I don't want to hear about that. Do you know what you've done?
[6144.36s -> 6149.56s]  We do have a pretty good boy song in the background. You should have known better than
[6149.56s -> 6155.37s]  to pick a fight with the bums. Of course if you agree to become one of my servants I suppose
[6155.37s -> 6167.70s]  I could forgive you. What do you say? Think so. All right then forget you. Fine see if I care.
[6167.70s -> 6171.70s]  I gave you a chance and you turned it down. Don't come back crying to me later.
[6181.80s -> 6222.12s]  Oh now you've done it. Now you've done it. Now I'm fucking mad. Ooh I got no range. Go for the
[6222.12s -> 6229.80s]  legs first. No I got this. This is not it. No no I'm not saying it. This is that's not a correct
[6229.80s -> 6263.94s]  line. This is this is this is a giant enemy squid. Ooh that hurt. Cover the bombs. Giant
[6263.94s -> 6291.14s]  enemy squid. I like to run and shoot. Very useful. The Mario gal. Whoa that was violent.
[6291.14s -> 6297.80s]  No it's okay she just got daffy ducked. She'll be fine. I mean you're stronger than I thought.
[6297.80s -> 6318.86s]  Give you credit for that. Get in quick right. It's not over yet. Don't think you've won.
[6318.86s -> 6325.26s]  Next time I won't be so easy on you. I'll make sure you pay for this. Let's go.
[6328.38s -> 6333.42s]  See what would have been really funny would have been door closed and they cut inside and she goes
[6333.42s -> 6353.38s]  how are we gonna pay for this? I could have wrote this. No come on that's that's a perfect
[6353.38s -> 6360.46s]  kids show for the bad guy to be like next time we see each other you'll pay for this. Oh wow
[6360.46s -> 6368.50s]  scary. Door closed. Turn to the minions. Oh are we gonna pay for this? Really? You don't think
[6368.50s -> 6372.02s]  that like your 10 year old little brother would have laughed or little sister would laugh at that?
[6372.02s -> 6380.30s]  Of course they would. You don't have to think it's funny. Your your eight year old kid did.
[6380.30s -> 6395.26s]  That wasn't that's not for you. That's not for you. Indications are that the mysterious group
[6395.26s -> 6400.98s]  of pirates will continue its offensive for the foreseeable future. Recapping our top story of
[6400.98s -> 6406.98s]  the day at two o'clock this afternoon the city center was attacked by a group of unknown pirates
[6406.98s -> 6412.02s]  who demanded they be given the keys to the caves and tunnels underneath. Is that one behind you? The
[6412.02s -> 6417.06s]  mayor has refused to give in to their demands and is currently under siege alone in city hall.
[6417.70s -> 6423.30s]  Local police are helpless in front of the power of the pirates weapons. It may be only a matter
[6423.30s -> 6432.42s]  of time before city hall is destroyed. Hopes are rapidly fading as I've just been handed this update
[6432.42s -> 6438.02s]  viewers. It appears that the robots and machines being used to lay siege to the city have been
[6438.02s -> 6448.17s]  destroyed by a single young boy and now that same boy has come through the gate and is heading
[6448.17s -> 6458.25s]  towards city hall wait there he is interview i can see him he really is alone can this lone
[6458.25s -> 6465.53s]  hero save the mayor defend city hall the red robots will attack city hall while the yellow
[6465.53s -> 6473.64s]  robots will attack the nearest building protect the city the police station and the bank get this
[6473.64s -> 6499.26s]  on camera is this an enemy give that money shit hold on it appears the boy is is a little confused
[6499.26s -> 6507.35s]  he thinks the local trash compactor is one of the robots attacking the city
[6507.99s -> 6521.06s]  ladies and gentlemen the john deere tractor over there seems to be getting a lot of attention
[6537.34s -> 6548.82s]  you there all right i gotta fucking bombs all right you uh oh can i aim up that far

[7028.90s -> 7042.94s]  let them take care of it themselves hey look at the clock it's almost time for my favorite show
[7042.94s -> 7049.66s]  i almost missed it next story city hall was attacked by a mysterious group of assailants
[7049.66s -> 7055.58s]  this afternoon but their offensive was beaten back by an equally mysterious young boy pictured
[7055.58s -> 7072.82s]  here on screen favorite show the news who the heck is that blue boy so bond was defeated but
[7072.82s -> 7078.18s]  what about drawn this is a potential disaster we could end up losing a lot of money on this one
[7085.85s -> 7091.85s]  all right it's obvious that i diesel bond will have to assume command who needs that key anyway
[7091.85s -> 7097.13s]  it might take some time and it might take some money but who cares i'll use my ultimate digging
[7097.13s -> 7102.57s]  machine the moral wolf to dig up the treasure myself and i won't let any little blue boy get
[7102.57s -> 7114.38s]  in my way either that was a great laugh wait a second bond's probably okay but what about
[7114.38s -> 7123.98s]  drawn i feel like it's talking about the same person tron is okay not bond is fine but bond
[7123.98s -> 7142.81s]  is tron tron is tron megaman you did it megaman let's go look for gramps tron and bond bond why
[7142.81s -> 7154.38s]  is it not bone tron bone on bone megaman roll sorry to give you a scare like that don't you
[7154.38s -> 7165.06s]  worry though i'm as healthy as i ever was that's a relief we were worried about you graham looks
[7165.06s -> 7170.66s]  like he's a statue actually with your help we were able to keep those pirates from getting the key
[7170.66s -> 7178.18s]  to the ruins thank you Amelia says she'll give us a digger's license as thanks for helping her
[7179.54s -> 7186.76s]  now we'll be able to look for parts to fix the flutter i know it's not much but it's the least i
[7186.76s -> 7199.08s]  can do for you you got a class a class be like excuse me your honor we got a new problem those
[7199.16s -> 7206.79s]  pirates have started digging up the northern forest what they weren't able to get the key
[7207.67s -> 7215.74s]  so they must be going after the treasure directly i'm amazed they'd go to that much trouble
[7215.74s -> 7222.92s]  even if they are criminals you've got to admire their persistence who knows what will happen if
[7222.92s -> 7230.41s]  they get their hands on the treasure inspector i want you to arrest them immediately yes ma'am
[7230.97s -> 7241.80s]  did we do it did we arrest them we'll have to make sure we get to the ruins
[7241.80s -> 7246.12s]  before the pirates do i'm sure they won't leave much by the time they're done
[7246.92s -> 7252.92s]  they're going to go to the ruins with a class b digger's license you can get into the ruins in
[7252.92s -> 7261.14s]  the cardan forest to the south and the ruins up north in the closer woods where the pirates are
[7261.14s -> 7277.91s]  now closer woods by role wait a minute oh you didn't talk to me i'm going with you look mega
[7277.91s -> 7284.66s]  man i fixed the car the junk shop owner gave us i may not have been able to get it fixed in
[7284.66s -> 7289.72s]  time to help you before but next time you can count on me car that you've said you're going
[7289.72s -> 7299.78s]  to fix up nice there goes the inspector color man off to get the pirates i wonder if he'll be
[7299.78s -> 7309.82s]  all right if they're using weapons like they did before the inspector might have some trouble
[7311.05s -> 7318.23s]  not to mention not to mention that the pirates are likely to steal everything if they get there first
[7319.27s -> 7326.87s]  well i think i better go help them be careful mega man i'll wait for you in the car we don't
[7326.87s -> 7332.95s]  get it i do is all the parts that you think might be useful bring them back to me i'll get them
[7332.95s -> 7346.71s]  fixed up and attach them for you right see you later what's wrong with your face nothing
[7364.38s -> 7368.22s]  the inspector is left to arrest the pirates i wanted to go too but it's just
[7368.78s -> 7379.48s]  as important that someone stays to guard the mayor you why are you parked like this that's
[7379.48s -> 7387.10s]  not a backpack he's buckled into his gamer chair so it doesn't look like a ride at universal studios
[7387.98s -> 7396.92s]  hey we'll show him just like we showed that officer we ain't gonna lose this time

[9279.38s -> 9289.43s]  that doesn't sound like a radio that sounded like she was talking to a pillow
[9290.07s -> 9297.85s]  or like through a wall if only we'd known there was someone like him here in the first place
[9297.85s -> 9304.97s]  we won't fail next time we'll ambush concentrate our firepower on him we won't cut him any slack
[9304.97s -> 9312.01s]  just because we outnumber him that kid's going down just wait till you see diesel i've got a new
[9312.01s -> 9317.93s]  robot i've been wanting to build that'll do the trick that'll teach him this time
[9317.93s -> 9331.83s]  we get rid of blue boy for sure and get that treasure did they make a cartoon about this
[9333.75s -> 9340.55s]  mega man good going you showed those pirates who's boss it looks like a screen name doesn't
[9340.55s -> 9345.03s]  look like i'm mega man that looks like my screen name is mega man you've done so much for us
[9345.99s -> 9351.70s]  i hope this will convince those pirates to give up i'm afraid to think what might happen if
[9351.70s -> 9357.59s]  they get their hands on the treasure the legends say a horrible disaster will occur if it's ever
[9357.59s -> 9367.32s]  unearthed even if that's just a myth lately we've been detecting increased activity underground
[9368.44s -> 9375.72s]  the reaver bots are apparently activating of their own accord it has me concerned maybe there's
[9375.88s -> 9379.40s]  talk about we gotta talk about the images about a horrible disaster let's talk about the images
[9380.38s -> 9387.00s]  i wonder mega man would you be willing to explore the caves and dungeons on the island
[9388.09s -> 9407.34s]  and see if you can find anything why why does it say no to this that's pretty good
[9409.59s -> 9415.75s]  you will oh thank you so well this is back when video games had a no response to everything
[9416.71s -> 9424.87s]  and it always was no you won't how could you say something like that will you and then you just say
[9424.87s -> 9428.31s]  yes right like they used to do this i don't know why why would what was the point of that
[9429.11s -> 9434.04s]  old games did this all the time it was always they give you a yes or no question and then you
[9434.04s -> 9438.20s]  just said you would answer no and it would be like a one sentence joke and they would go back to yes
[9439.40s -> 9450.63s]  only the best diggers are able to get a class a license the best of the best with that license
[9450.87s -> 9456.47s]  you'll be able to get into the sealed off sites sealed off sites the ones those pirates have been
[9456.47s -> 9463.45s]  trying to break into i give you my permission to dig in the island's sub gates just let me know if
[9463.45s -> 9467.61s]  you find anything that can tell us about the treasure or that disaster that's supposed to
[9467.61s -> 9479.69s]  happen and i hate to mention this but if while you're digging you find anything of value it would
[9479.69s -> 9483.77s]  mean a lot to us if you could donate it to help with the restoration of the city
[9484.89s -> 9497.53s]  thank you again be careful can somebody give me a health potion i am i was stubbed toe away from
[9497.53s -> 9507.99s]  dying three different ways underground ruins called sub gates one is in the garden forest
[9507.99s -> 9513.83s]  where we crashed another is in a lake in the uptown area which is to the west of the city and the last
[9513.83s -> 9520.31s]  one is to the north in the closer woods which is where pirates just were i wonder which one you
[9520.31s -> 9530.41s]  should check out first um we'll go to the crash site where we actually crashed oh i want a bank
[9530.41s -> 9558.74s]  account too uh let's save save i smell a car joke um i mean that would have been bad it would have
[9558.74s -> 9563.94s]  been funny for a sec but then i would have had to do the entire boss over again and i'm i'm not i
[9563.94s -> 9568.18s]  don't want to no that's that's too far back we got all the dialogue to go through the cut scenes
[9569.30s -> 9578.57s]  no no no no not gonna happen all right talk to roll i have some equipment let me tell you about
[9578.57s -> 9582.65s]  what i can do for you yeah i look at first of all you can change your special weapons here
[9583.37s -> 9587.29s]  you can only use one special weapon at a time let me know when you want to switch
[9588.25s -> 9591.77s]  also it costs a little money but we can enhance your special weapons here
[9592.73s -> 9597.05s]  is item development i might be able to make something new out of things you find
[9597.05s -> 9603.98s]  in the ruins find something interesting we should bring it back here last we can use the support
[9603.98s -> 9609.42s]  car to move around the island nice fast travel capcom thought of everything here i made a walkie
[9609.42s -> 9614.38s]  talkie for you can use to call me anytime use it when you want me to pick you up in the support car
[9615.82s -> 9622.39s]  i can now give the walkie talkie back and make it into a weapon there's a few places i can't get
[9622.39s -> 9631.83s]  the car won't be able to pick you up even if you call me sorry okay uh item development okay i'll
[9631.83s -> 9644.34s]  take a look the cannon kit was used to make powered buster special weapon this weapon has
[9644.34s -> 9649.62s]  a really long range in a pretty good punch but it's great a fire isn't that great don't forget
[9649.62s -> 9656.15s]  that when you get into a fight don't forget what oh don't forget that all right any more item

[10060.47s -> 10068.78s]  with those pirates running around these are some loud ass birds somebody said it when we first
[10068.78s -> 10087.88s]  started playing new it's seriously it's looking for a sub gate what does a sub gate look like
[10088.76s -> 10097.37s]  it's not bad right i mean it looks like it could be a sub gate but haven't we gone in here before
[10098.81s -> 10104.06s]  i was looking for mushrooms on the other side of the passage when a tank rolled up out of nowhere
[10105.18s -> 10113.14s]  i'm getting out of here that was quick holy shit that was fast

[10172.02s -> 10180.97s]  if you're in trouble use the car as a shield roll use the car as a shit was a payload
[10184.38s -> 10209.88s]  all right we're almost out to this first checkpoint this i'll get too much damage
[10210.68s -> 10224.87s]  i want rapid fire i feel like it'd be more useful to me the cart has almost reached the final

[10364.38s -> 10370.55s]  is the refractor shielded most high level refractors are protected in some kind of shield
[10371.51s -> 10375.51s]  you'll have to look for the control console and deactivate the shield
[10375.51s -> 10385.21s]  thank you for the info hamster in my front pocket nothing it looks like the starter is missing
[10386.17s -> 10389.61s]  it's probably hidden somewhere nearby you'll have to find it
[10391.26s -> 10399.30s]  remember there might be more than one starter key too more than one key all right we're gonna
[10399.30s -> 10408.49s]  activate the refractor they got super powered super charged up fighting abilities
[10409.85s -> 10416.81s]  and look at this range i don't think that ai doesn't start and i win oh my god that's a lot

[14222.44s -> 14235.82s]  talking about the family size the one that looks like a joke gold bar from the old movies more
[14235.82s -> 14246.90s]  items not this shit more to explore
[14260.94s -> 14266.30s]  eat velveta on screen you know i'll give you a quick little story all right so
[14268.58s -> 14272.98s]  kim and i made macaroni and cheese one night in quotes from scratch right we didn't get out of
[14272.98s -> 14280.98s]  a box we got a bunch of velveta we got some other cheeses we got elbow macaroni and we got some
[14280.98s -> 14284.26s]  spices we're gonna make it was like a little date let's make our own mac and cheese great
[14285.38s -> 14291.80s]  and you guys don't know about velveta i'm that's gonna kill me well it will if you eat too much
[14291.80s -> 14300.50s]  but i'm talking about the game um velveta is so heavy and so thick that when you're hungry
[14300.50s -> 14305.37s]  and you make macaroni and cheese with velveta you always are like you know what fuck it let's
[14305.37s -> 14314.49s]  put half the brick in yeah yep that's what i want to do don't do that don't put in oh my god
[14314.49s -> 14355.77s]  oh my god oh my god oh my god dead oh he's killing everything he's coming back he's coming back he's

[14450.65s -> 14458.17s]  it's really tempting because you just plump it in there and it's melts but that shit turns
[14459.05s -> 14468.65s]  into cement wait and when you start to mix it up and it starts to lose some of its liquid content
[14469.77s -> 14476.89s]  it turns into this thick cement like substance it's it's crazy how just too much it is

[14909.16s -> 14917.56s]  to be fixed i have this right there i have a brace on that means no i was already up there
[14918.52s -> 14926.49s]  and definitely i'm wearing a brace that makes it so i can't now i'm lost in here
[14929.13s -> 14949.03s]  it wasn't this way this is i gotta get out of this over here uh yeah the brace that i'm wearing
[14949.03s -> 14955.03s]  it means i can't physically put my shoulders forward i can't it'll be tension on my back and
[14955.03s -> 14956.07s]  chest and stuff and stomach
[14960.79s -> 14963.27s]  and it also puts a little bit of pressure underneath my rib cage which
[14964.17s -> 14981.06s]  makes me feel a bit better roller board you're just strapped into your boomer seat
[14990.97s -> 14998.57s]  so we can go we went this way let's pack it back up and go up let's go
[15000.34s -> 15007.86s]  all right so when i did this because remember i this my ps2 is going through a capture card
[15007.86s -> 15014.34s]  which is then upscaling it to 1080p right i have a device that does that for that operation to
[15014.34s -> 15022.01s]  happen it takes about one full second so i just got terrified because on my left monitor there's
[15022.01s -> 15025.69s]  a small pre there's a preview window over here at the stream so when i went like this
[15026.25s -> 15030.57s]  i almost two full seconds later i thought my other monitor blue screen
[15031.45s -> 15034.49s]  i was like what the fuck is going on it was very very scary
[15037.61s -> 15048.12s]  that happens a lot that shit happens all the time
[15048.12s -> 15051.62s]  especially when i'm playing uh an old console that has to go through the capture cards
[15052.50s -> 15055.86s]  so
[15059.22s -> 15065.77s]  i slenderman myself yeah all right what have we got chest here

[20403.08s -> 20414.46s]  does it cost energy to use it no it doesn't all right maybe i'll try it
[20415.18s -> 20429.29s]  and upgrade it pretty cheap too all right so remind me to look at the vacuum when i get out
[20429.29s -> 20435.42s]  of the game but when i get it into the boat it's a car whatever the thing is it holds

[21451.66s -> 21456.78s]  these you'll be able to move a lot faster than you can by running just be careful you don't get a hit
[21457.74s -> 21463.82s]  like cars if you use them in the city all right activate hold down the circle button
[21464.54s -> 21468.70s]  the jet skates will turn off if you release the circle button but when you take damage from an
[21468.70s -> 21477.34s]  enemy attack you can slide while using the skates to use the directional button all right cool
[21477.66s -> 21485.08s]  the joint plug was used to make adapter plug attached to your mega man buster until now you've
[21485.08s -> 21490.60s]  only been able to use two parts simultaneously right well with this you'll be able to use three
[21491.86s -> 21496.90s]  different parts at the same time fuck yeah what do you think about that i think it's pretty great
[21496.90s -> 21514.60s]  actually all right let me take uh change weapon grenade arm it's a vacuum flash mime normal arm

[21583.26s -> 21590.47s]  jet set radio because it's it's it's very uh it's a very precise game i the jumping and the landing
[21590.47s -> 21599.86s]  and grinding and i got upset by it all right sniper unit laser do we do some just mega power
[21600.50s -> 21611.53s]  or do i do rapid fire machine gun and i think machine gun will be pretty good or just

[21945.38s -> 21979.43s]  developing it's been five minutes without a joke streaming career over machine buster
[21979.99s -> 21986.09s]  unfortunately it's not that great in terms of power so you might have to put some thought into
[21986.09s -> 22003.19s]  how you use it vacuum arm special weapon yep here is gonna be over okay let's see it change weapon
[22003.19s -> 22017.21s]  so here we are grenade arm vacuum arm enhance it the vacuum arm no i want to do the vacuum arm
[22017.77s -> 22029.10s]  increase weapon use time like yeah holy shit this is maxed out what about the range 500 that's cheap
[22030.30s -> 22045.80s]  more that's pretty cheap one more range is maxed out increases suction speed most expensive part
[22045.80s -> 22052.15s]  more suction speed level three the highest amount of suction you could possibly have
[22053.11s -> 22063.42s]  maxed out maxed out maxed out but what was the new thing i got too it's not splash i don't like
[22063.42s -> 22071.66s]  the mice normal arm machine buster machine buster here it is firepower special what is this

[22204.49s -> 22214.78s]  about way is one of my favorite usernames just because it's so it's so specific and never used
[22214.78s -> 22235.77s]  and that use case is just at as close to zero as you can get i have two starter keys need one more
[22236.49s -> 22247.03s]  let's start skiing how much energy does this use infinite energy yeah i say yeah should be
[22248.97s -> 22261.98s]  why is it using the bat i'm just testing it well it's pretty good pretty useful
[22263.66s -> 22272.17s]  look at how much more damage i'm doing too this is great it's such a huge range too
[22283.34s -> 22296.14s]  it's a speed run gun is it actually i feel like that's not lies i feel like that could be pretty
[22296.14s -> 22322.97s]  accurate just a hole i got that hole before pretty satisfying to use too where are we going i need
[22322.97s -> 22346.46s]  one more key wait two holes what time is it your bedtime yet not yet how do you sleep when you're
[22346.46s -> 22354.60s]  sick um it depends on how you stuffed up i always like to put a couple of pillows underneath my
[22354.60s -> 22359.88s]  head and shoulders because then when you lie back if you have a stuffy nose and a sore throat
[22360.76s -> 22370.12s]  it it starts closing you up so sit making lying down and having your head propped up a little bit
[22370.12s -> 22374.44s]  help uh somebody said humidifier that was like the next thing i was gonna say was uh
[22374.44s -> 22387.54s]  humidifier potentially and don't don't abuse it because it's really not great for you

[22392.50s -> 22401.34s]  like nyquil is is in very very small moderation is good i think make sure you stay make sure you
[22401.34s -> 22418.70s]  can play in water one of the things about nyquil is nyquil uh uh has a cedaminophen in it and it's
[22418.70s -> 22422.30s]  i got a full dose of a cedaminophen and people just go oh i'm just gonna drink some more nyquil
[22422.30s -> 22427.02s]  have like double triple the dose you're taking like a two to three times a dose of cedaminophen
[22427.02s -> 22430.22s]  that you should be taking and it's really not good for you at all it's actually very bad for
[22430.22s -> 22446.31s]  you so you shouldn't be doing that it's really really bad for your liver it can make you pretty
[22446.31s -> 22453.61s]  it can actually make you sick really sick you take too much cedaminophen in one day more than
[22453.61s -> 22464.94s]  the recommended amount actually you can get actually very sick all right let's go where

[25029.72s -> 25034.12s]  milia asked me to find out what i could about that treasure that's supposed to be right here
[25034.76s -> 25038.20s]  this island just got so many mysteries i just don't know where to start looking
[25039.16s -> 25046.46s]  it have you ever heard of the main gate yes yes i said oh you have hey and you probably already
[25046.46s -> 25052.30s]  know this but the largest ruin on the island it's called the main gate and can be found near the old
[25052.30s -> 25059.94s]  city what's unusual about it is as far as anyone knows there's no way to get inside i have a theory
[25059.94s -> 25066.66s]  that's connected to some it's connected in some way with the sub gates tell me mega man you found
[25066.66s -> 25073.06s]  a passage in the sub gate that connects to the main gate no if i'm right sub gate in the closer
[25073.06s -> 25077.94s]  woods there's some kind of key for the main gate and i'm willing to bet anything it's treasuring
[25077.94s -> 25083.26s]  those pirates a little after it's inside the main gate they probably realized how close and they are
[25083.26s -> 25092.47s]  and the treasurer don't let your guard down thank you elderly fuck hey all right time the person up

[25242.49s -> 25254.66s]  wasn't i already there there you go bomb schematic was used to make the grand grenade special weapon
[25255.46s -> 25263.02s]  allows you to shoot out even stronger grenade bomb they're really powerful you might even be able
[25263.02s -> 25272.84s]  used to blow up walls inside the ruins well would you look at that that's how you break open the walls
[25272.84s -> 25283.66s]  okay grand grenade and now we're gonna enhance the grand grenade we're gonna make it that's
[25283.66s -> 25303.48s]  a hundred thousand dollars this is all very expensive damn if you compliment her every

[25415.67s -> 25439.08s]  sub gates or the closer woods go to the r&d room oh go to the sub gate yes
[25446.92s -> 25453.75s]  remember what are those three wacky numbers in the back of your credit card

[25562.66s -> 25568.97s]  tell your daughter that i would talk to my daughter that's like just are you okay
[25568.97s -> 25593.05s]  no can you see a door somewhere there are many doors this is a big place
[25593.77s -> 25600.86s]  we got it's my guess the computers out in that room can you see a switch anywhere i don't see
[25600.86s -> 25609.51s]  any switches but there's some writing here let's see it says operations room two
[25610.55s -> 25620.23s]  emergency system activation requires direct password input from eden or the insertion of
[25620.23s -> 25631.67s]  three level two or three id cards prototype and throw unit id cards what's the prototype
[25631.67s -> 25642.26s]  and throw unit stop it's supposed to be like 10 well whatever that is you need if we're lucky
[25642.26s -> 25654.94s]  you'll be able to find them inside there it's ancient writing yeah well guys he's not reading
[25654.94s -> 25671.48s]  off of a dinner menu this is ancient alien text you think he can read that well there's a door back

[26486.25s -> 26491.93s]  behind me if i turn around then it pops in and it gets actually rendered into the game's engine
[26491.93s -> 26519.64s]  so don't turn around it's probably a hole in here test their id card i need one more and then
[26519.64s -> 26524.84s]  where's the last boss that's what um one person told me they said dude you're at the last boss
[26524.84s -> 26535.10s]  with these id cards and i'm like fucking nice i am gonna leave and save so and refill my canteen
[26536.06s -> 26551.48s]  this is dangerous coward i want to live i don't want to lose 40 minutes of progress again
[26552.04s -> 26562.46s]  straight down
[26565.98s -> 26588.57s]  uh oh are we getting a wait this is i know where this is

[26651.98s -> 26653.98s]  i need to go down this way
[26667.69s -> 26674.49s]  at least it's health i have items to give to roll as well i yeah i don't want to stay down here
[26675.45s -> 26683.75s]  target sensor front clips front clips are superior well front clips are actually harder
[26683.75s -> 26707.43s]  to do i think than backflips in some regard i definitely can't do it anymore and i really hope
[26707.43s -> 26713.19s]  that there's some recording of me doing it but i used to actually be able to do a full backflip
[26713.19s -> 26718.78s]  from standing on the ground i could not do a front flip though no matter how hard i tried i could
[26718.78s -> 26735.19s]  never do it front flips always were impossible for me can i get out of here from this i think
[26735.19s -> 26749.14s]  i can right if i go this way ancient book well that's cool nice
[26751.62s -> 26773.48s]  i can't leave though i just want to get out of this all right is it straight ahead i think it's
[26773.48s -> 26795.50s]  straight ahead and not destroy those walls i don't think i can destroy those walls i'm so
[26795.50s -> 26804.20s]  turned around right now this is the generator room i gotta go back to the room with the chest
[26804.20s -> 26812.39s]  center and then i forget after that we're gonna go this way
[26819.59s -> 26828.60s]  germa do it i it's the debated song that's okay i got it
[26830.76s -> 26835.94s]  now is the secret room

[26871.24s -> 26879.67s]  what's over here i can't tell if you hate this game or if you hate streaming in general
[26880.47s -> 26884.23s]  i can't tell if you're really mr comcaster if you stole that name and it's identity if you're
[26884.23s -> 26893.45s]  stealing a company i say identity that's right i can't tell we're both on the same page
[26897.83s -> 26926.62s]  i have power holy shit i got power wait a minute we have you on camera all right i gotta stop reading
[26926.62s -> 26938.09s]  chat and then figure out how to get the fuck out of here here we go germa doesn't pay taxes
[26941.96s -> 26963.99s]  yeah i i do actually i'm back all right roll come here what is that reaction
[26965.51s -> 26991.88s]  yes i do yes i do okay let's make him make an item he's probably painfully aware of how much
[26991.88s -> 27007.43s]  he pays active buster fires a homing missile that will track the nearest enemy okay so homing
[27008.15s -> 27013.88s]  still a lot of enhancements that could make i'm enhancing this one i'm gonna spend a ton of money
[27013.88s -> 27032.22s]  on it buster sniper scope it increases your firing range as far as it will go so i max out
[27032.22s -> 27039.34s]  my range hold on let's take a look i keep the grand grenade on though i feel like i need it
[27039.34s -> 27063.51s]  if there's a level arm machine buster uh what should i put on maybe the machine buster i want
[27063.51s -> 27080.10s]  to try it for active buster powered buster grenade arm vacuum arm active buster it's
[27080.10s -> 27093.19s]  an answer active buster attack it's also expensive homing capability i have a lot of money but do i
[27093.19s -> 27116.94s]  want to spend it on here upgrades its homing capability let's go i want it more spiring speed
[27121.05s -> 27154.17s]  more range that's 20 000 dollars um ammo i think better be good talk to data energy charge okay
[27154.17s -> 27191.06s]  save again this is a boss wrecker cool go back in uh we want to talk to roll this is my first time
[27191.06s -> 27197.34s]  playing this it'll go back to the far away that's where i want to go wait because that's where i
[27197.34s -> 27203.30s]  want to go right no no i want to go to the sub gate no no i'm already at the sub gate right
[27203.30s -> 27208.74s]  just leave uh this is my first time playing through this game yes i've played it before a
[27208.74s -> 27220.23s]  long time ago i never got past a certain point i actually think the first two hours three hours
[27220.23s -> 27228.70s]  of the game they get the energy canteen nah all right now we can go to the elevator
[27229.34s -> 27244.39s]  so that other elevator was where was it i don't remember over here i remember where the other
[27244.39s -> 27259.96s]  elevator was i don't have any idea what else is lost as i am it might be time for food real food
[27260.76s -> 27269.48s]  because people are writing hash house a gogo in the chat and i mean you're you're you're trying
[27269.56s -> 27276.65s]  to get me to turn the stream off like that's actively oh my god hash house a gogo is so
[27276.65s -> 27282.81s]  fucking delicious current i'm turning off the stream and that's what's happening with what you

[27388.20s -> 27395.29s]  remembering where doors go yeah it's time for food that's that's that's how you quantify if it's time

[29578.25s -> 29586.42s]  incredibly well we also had 250 from jewels
[29586.42s -> 29590.71s]  jewels say hey germa after watching the end of the stream from yesterday my
[29590.71s -> 29593.43s]  brother has been making fun of me relentlessly
[29593.43s -> 29597.11s]  all day today that my favorite streamer doesn't wash his hands
[29597.11s -> 29601.75s]  after using the toilet he said the origins of your name is probably not
[29601.75s -> 29604.57s]  related but he also said that you did not deny
[29604.57s -> 29607.93s]  not washing your hands after touching the toilet handle and your
[29607.93s -> 29611.77s]  privates please tell him the truth otherwise i'll have to suplex my brother
[29611.77s -> 29619.56s]  to the next dimension and i'm half his weight what i
[29619.56s -> 29623.77s]  yes i wash my hands after going to the bathroom
[29623.77s -> 29626.89s]  in fact let me go over this with some of you guys
[29626.89s -> 29630.33s]  um i pre-wash before going to the bathroom
[29630.33s -> 29634.39s]  you get people going into the bathroom i'm just talking like
[29634.39s -> 29642.14s]  going to the urinal and they just pull up down their pants and pee
[29642.14s -> 29645.96s]  and like grab their you know private and pee
[29645.96s -> 29650.94s]  without washing their hands first so that's
[29650.94s -> 29654.06s]  all the stuff that you've been touching throughout the course of that day why
[29654.06s -> 29659.91s]  not wash your hands first before you touch your bear you know
[29660.92s -> 29665.10s]  and then wash again there's a pre-wash to get the germs off your hands before
[29665.10s -> 29669.59s]  you touch your and then there's a sec second wash after
[29669.59s -> 29679.35s]  you're done think about that imagine like grabbing
[29679.35s -> 29682.63s]  like the door handle to even the like pushing the bathroom door open that's
[29682.63s -> 29687.19s]  been touched 500 million times and probably cleaned once a week and
[29687.19s -> 29697.64s]  then you grab your penis i just spit everywhere but i'm
[29697.64s -> 29706.65s]  being dead serious can you imagine not doing a small pre-wash
[29706.81s -> 29710.01s]  a pre-wash is not the same as post wash a pre-wash
[29710.01s -> 29714.25s]  is just a little bit of soap and just a little bit under the water
[29714.25s -> 29717.62s]  just a little and then the post wash is a little bit is to
[29717.62s -> 29723.19s]  really clean it up i don't know how this is such a strange concept to some of you
[29723.19s -> 29733.00s]  guys say a pre-washing your hands before you
[29733.00s -> 29745.70s]  touch down there is apparently weird do you pre-wash before a shower
[29745.70s -> 29749.78s]  when i'm taking what do you what the shower is the wash
[29749.78s -> 29752.66s]  the pre-wash of your hands before touching your
[29752.66s -> 29757.94s]  penis is because that's saying that word people are gonna fucking clip this and
[29757.94s -> 29763.78s]  take it and put it somewhere um before i go in the shower guys i
[29763.78s -> 29769.90s]  don't like just start grabbing and like what you know what that's a good idea
[29769.90s -> 29773.34s]  right now before i get in the shower i'm just gonna like mush my hands down
[29773.34s -> 29779.61s]  here and what are you talking about so you
[29779.61s -> 29782.49s]  open the door or open the curtain to the shower and you
[29782.49s -> 29791.53s]  get it and turn the water on next time you go to the doctor
[29791.53s -> 29794.57s]  i'm say i'm next time you go to the doctor listen to me next time you go to
[29794.57s -> 29798.57s]  the doctor i want you to ask the doctor say hey um
[29798.57s -> 29803.06s]  as a medical professional do you think it's a good idea
[29803.06s -> 29807.70s]  to wash your hands before you pee into a urinal
[29807.70s -> 29811.46s]  and i'll bet you the doctor is gonna go yeah that sounds like a good way to
[29811.46s -> 29813.78s]  avoid getting sick and germs and touching
[29813.78s -> 29817.62s]  touching your dick with your hands that you've been grabbing all over stuff and
[29817.62s -> 29820.66s]  grabbing it on escalator rails and then you pee
[29820.66s -> 29830.44s]  actually yeah i think that's a good idea that's what would happen anyways thanks
[29830.44s -> 29833.45s]  for the uh thanks for the 250 i wash my hands
[29833.45s -> 29843.77s]  multiple times potion toilet thanks for the 250
