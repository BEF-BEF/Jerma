[0.31s -> 16.34s]  My friends are kind of shy, press button 1 to talk to them. Stick around, they may have a lot to say.
[16.34s -> 24.34s]  Well that's good. Button 11 is jump. Button 2, what are those? Oh. Why am I taking advice from rats?
[24.34s -> 32.59s]  Why, and why are they, why can they talk? It's all about the speed, dude. See, look at that. Just don't, just gotta move.
[32.59s -> 38.77s]  Same exact thing I would say about Super Meat Boy. These like super crazy, like hard, like unforgiving platformers.
[38.77s -> 46.77s]  You just gotta go. You just gotta move, man. Take a look at that. That's how we do it. 22 seconds, almost flat.
[46.77s -> 57.01s]  Best time in the world, 22 seconds, look. So I'm gonna push this rock over to the right side of the rocks.
[57.01s -> 65.01s]  Rock's gonna get hit by the dart coming out of the statue's mouth. Statue's gonna bounce over, off the McDonald's, off Grimace's head, nothing but net.
[65.01s -> 73.78s]  You got it? Let's do it. You're supposed to wait, huh? Go on. Come on. Come on out.
[81.91s -> 87.28s]  Oh, I have to get this, I gotta get this crystal skull. Come on, I'm Indiana Jones. The worst movie he made.
[87.28s -> 94.35s]  Fuck! I've gotta get that skull. It's very important. I need to get like the super points. I have to.
[94.35s -> 104.02s]  If I don't get the extra points, then what's the point? That was a pretty good pun, wasn't it? If I can't get, I gotta write that down.
[104.02s -> 116.46s]  Hold on. If I can't get the points, then what's the point? Give me an Emmy. Give me a fucking Emmy!
[116.46s -> 128.94s]  So this is where the actual game starts, huh? Things have fallen already. Unforgiving. We're not gonna get our hands holed anymore.
[128.94s -> 135.11s]  There's no mice. None of our mice friends are here to tell us super secret strategies. So we're on our own.
[136.99s -> 145.59s]  No. No. I guess we gotta go this way then. I guess so.
[147.96s -> 159.43s]  Oh, I can push this. Just need to use a little bit of science. Once you've deduced the problem with the scientific method, that's when you win the game.
[159.43s -> 166.51s]  Good old science! She planted me with science!
[166.51s -> 174.53s]  I'm not gonna last. If you guys think you're gonna get a series out of this, I ain't gonna last, dude.
[174.53s -> 183.06s]  I'm gonna last like 20 minutes and I'm gonna go get like a fucking sandwich. That sounds like a better idea.
[183.06s -> 186.06s]  You know what? What kind of sandwich do I want? Now that I'm thinking about it.
[186.06s -> 191.87s]  Because that's like more important to me right now than this like game that's really hard.
[191.87s -> 199.01s]  I think maybe I'd get a large like steak and cheese with some onions. Mmm. That sounds pretty good.
[199.01s -> 206.45s]  Maybe a buffalo chicken sub with extra blue cheese on it. That sounds pretty damn good.
[206.45s -> 213.45s]  Yeah, stop talking about sandwiches and play the game. Like focus. Focus on the game, not buffalo subs.
[213.45s -> 218.78s]  Not messing around. I need to be level one. Level one needs to be completed.
[218.78s -> 224.78s]  Fucking god damn. We're gonna cut that out. We're gonna edit. See, we just edited.
[224.78s -> 230.78s]  Hey, what's going on? Jerma here. We're just gonna play some Thousand and One Spikes level one. It's fucking easy.
[230.78s -> 240.70s]  This is my first try. You know what I mean? So is it weird to lose like almost like 50 lives before the first level?
[240.70s -> 245.07s]  Is that considered? Am I good? Am I good at this game?
[245.07s -> 252.27s]  Okay, assess the situation here. When I jump up, I'm gonna get shot. So I don't want to go that way. I want to go across.
[252.27s -> 264.22s]  I knew it. Yeah, you can't trick me. Spikes. You always have to look out for spikes. There's spikes everywhere in this game.
[264.22s -> 272.08s]  I know the game's called Thousand and One Spikes, but there's spikes just everywhere. There's spikes everywhere and there's scorpions.
[272.08s -> 280.02s]  Isn't that like a Pokemon? That looks like a Pokemon. Is that like Scorpezoid? Isn't that a Pokemon?
[280.02s -> 284.02s]  When is my Scorpezoid gonna evolve into like a fucking Scorpezio?
[284.02s -> 294.00s]  Whoa! I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I'm freaking out.
[294.00s -> 299.43s]  Alright, just stay right there. Okay, we just got a bunch of Scorpezoids just dropped. Good to know.
[299.43s -> 304.67s]  Drop down here. No, not yet. Not yet. We're gonna wait. We have to wait till he goes the other way.
[304.67s -> 309.49s]  Get out of the way. Here we go.
[309.49s -> 318.29s]  Spike? Yep. I know your game now. I know your stupid game, Spike. Spike? No.
[318.29s -> 329.42s]  Shit. What do I do here? What do I do here? I can't do anything here. I can't make that jump either, can I? Can I?
[329.42s -> 341.50s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think I can. I can.
[344.64s -> 351.64s]  Button. Press. Jump. Long jump. Long jump.
[351.64s -> 358.38s]  So what happens if I die 946 more times and the game's over? Is that how this works? That's definitely gonna happen.
[358.38s -> 369.38s]  I'll burn through like 700 of these by World 3. Well, I should probably be careful then.
[370.38s -> 378.14s]  Excuse me. I said excuse me. You're supposed to get out of the way. This is like World 1.
[378.14s -> 386.52s]  Jump. Drop down here. Jump. Shoot. Jump. Shoot. Jump. Shoot. Got it.
[386.52s -> 395.97s]  Scorpezoid. Get out of my face. Do I risk it? This is a bad idea. This is a really bad idea.
[395.97s -> 405.58s]  I knew it was a bad idea. That's exactly what I needed. Okay. We're gonna drop this one down too.
[405.58s -> 412.52s]  Go. Go for it. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Just don't screw it up now.
[412.52s -> 422.35s]  Don't you dare. I don't even know. I think. I swear. I'm good. Yay.
[422.35s -> 430.20s]  So what do I do here? Do I drop down here? I don't know. I'm confused.
[430.20s -> 442.09s]  So I must have to break that? I don't know. Don't do that. You're gonna get burnt. Now do it.
[442.09s -> 452.86s]  Okay. It's broken now. One more time. Go. Spikes. Yeah. See? You didn't think I knew that was gonna happen?
[452.86s -> 461.98s]  You think what? You think I'm an idiot right now? Dude, I'm so scared right now.
[461.98s -> 467.66s]  Where do I even go? When I get over here, there's gonna be like spikes and shit.
[467.66s -> 472.22s]  And there's gonna be like a face shooting at me. Darts. And you know it's gonna happen.
[472.22s -> 477.84s]  And I'm probably not gonna survive this because I have not been down here yet. Oh, God.
[477.84s -> 486.35s]  Make it. Make it. No. I turned and I shot. I turned and I shot. I did.
[486.35s -> 492.30s]  And you all saw it. I turned with total precision. That's it. That's it. No.
[492.30s -> 496.30s]  We're done here. We're done with this. I'm just gonna go for it and I'm gonna get it right now.
[496.30s -> 502.79s]  No stopping. No bullshit. This is the Super Meat Boy strategy. I've said this before. Just go.
[502.79s -> 506.79s]  Just go. Don't even stop for anything except for the things that you have to stop for.
[506.79s -> 512.85s]  Go. Like, for instance, just go. Right now. Turn. I'm shooting. Just go.
[512.85s -> 518.35s]  After this, we're just gonna go. We're gonna go the whole way. Whole way. Yeah.
[518.35s -> 524.10s]  Yeah. Come on. Shoot it again. Go. Shoot it again.
[524.10s -> 528.10s]  I'm beating this right now. Wait for the stupid piss fire to come out.
[528.10s -> 533.94s]  No. No. Just wait. Hold on. Not yet.
[533.94s -> 538.39s]  Now do it. I'm just so concerned about the leftover here.
[538.39s -> 544.36s]  And even though it's coming out so slowly. God. Seriously. Go.
[544.36s -> 549.67s]  Grab this. Watch the spike. Watch the spike. Nothing's right here. But I can go.
[549.67s -> 555.28s]  Time to go. It's time just to go. Just go. After this, you're going. You're gone.
[555.28s -> 562.75s]  You're already gone. And... Holy shit! Oh my god!
[562.75s -> 568.75s]  Yes! Oh. Ooh. Ooh.
[568.75s -> 574.64s]  Is that the end? Is that the end of stage two? I hope so.
