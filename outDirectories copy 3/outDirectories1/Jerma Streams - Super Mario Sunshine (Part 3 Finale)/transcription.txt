[72.38s -> 75.98s]  Wink blink and then turn the camera off. That's a god. It's gone on sunday
[76.70s -> 78.06s]  They're gonna be
[78.06s -> 80.06s]  Very significantly reduced in price
[81.10s -> 82.70s]  It's gonna be a whole thing
[82.70s -> 84.70s]  That's sunday. It's the last day
[88.73s -> 91.10s]  Your voice is high pitched
[91.18s -> 95.37s]  What are you talking about?
[95.37s -> 99.28s]  It it shouldn't be
[99.36s -> 103.52s]  My thing has turned off. How is it? What do you mean high pitch? What are you talking about?
[105.72s -> 110.28s]  Turn the compressor. There's no compressor. That's the same settings from you literally yesterday. What are you talking about?
[112.46s -> 120.62s]  I haven't changed shit
[120.62s -> 122.30s]  We have 58
[122.30s -> 128.24s]  Shines in mario sunshine. I'm gonna finish it today. I could have finished it yesterday, but I was like
[130.00s -> 134.48s]  I didn't want to just rush through it. I know I probably could have finished the game in like an hour or two
[135.77s -> 141.05s]  But i'd like to take my time with the game. I've never played it so we're gonna go
[145.79s -> 146.83s]  Erase
[146.83s -> 152.20s]  Do a new game start new game
[155.80s -> 162.12s]  All shines and blue coins or else hold on. I gotta mute these things. Uh, I gotta move my microphone. I don't want to like
[170.49s -> 174.22s]  All right. There we go. Okay
[174.22s -> 175.26s]  so
[175.26s -> 177.26s]  With the last thing I did
[178.22s -> 180.22s]  What is left to do?
[180.54s -> 182.89s]  But I could very slowly
[182.89s -> 185.63s]  Very cautiously do
[185.63s -> 186.67s]  We have
[186.67s -> 192.14s]  Deontah village
[192.14s -> 195.74s]  I think I have seven stars in every single one of these the only ones I don't have are the coins
[198.25s -> 202.19s]  Oh, what about here?
[202.19s -> 205.55s]  Airstrip there's only one on the air. How do I get to the airstrip though?
[206.19s -> 213.32s]  Didn't somebody say that the airstrip that this was like the weird yoshi thing, right?
[213.96s -> 218.73s]  Like what's over there?
[218.73s -> 220.73s]  somebody else's game footage
[223.34s -> 224.78s]  That'd be so
[224.78s -> 228.94s]  Mad about well, no, there's you know how you could tell if this was somebody else's game footage
[229.58s -> 234.32s]  As if I was back here and just fucking hanging up
[235.45s -> 240.28s]  Oh look out. I gotta get that
[240.28s -> 242.28s]  Oh, I guess I can go this way
[242.60s -> 244.43s]  All right, that's kind of cool
[244.43s -> 249.55s]  So no like i'm i'm in i'm leaning i'm forward. We're not leaning but i'm microphones up here
[250.35s -> 251.71s]  What's over here?
[251.71s -> 260.22s]  This is the thing with the yoshi, right?
[261.18s -> 264.78s]  I need to get yoshi over here and somebody linked me a video
[264.78s -> 268.22s]  They said this was horrible and they linked me a video. I didn't watch the video
[269.10s -> 274.51s]  Put out his fire
[274.51s -> 283.58s]  I was shipwrecked and washed up here three years ago. I have to think about the far shore, but I can't swim
[284.06s -> 286.46s]  I've never left this island. Isn't that just awful?
[287.18s -> 292.43s]  I mean that is pretty awful
[292.43s -> 294.59s]  All right for what?
[294.59s -> 295.55s]  Okay
[295.55s -> 300.35s]  There's a boat right there
[300.35s -> 302.35s]  Should I get the egg?

[329.87s -> 343.74s]  Why did I fall off?
[343.74s -> 350.65s]  Where's this go?
[350.65s -> 352.41s]  Oh shit, there's a banana
[352.41s -> 353.77s]  Should I get the banana?
[353.85s -> 357.74s]  Should I get should I get the banana? I think i'm gonna try to get this banana
[358.80s -> 360.80s]  Why is there a banana up here? Makes no sense
[361.82s -> 366.89s]  Why would there be banana here? What's this? Oh shit

[374.16s -> 376.16s]  All right. I have I got the banana

[413.40s -> 421.02s]  But there are bananas at the market
[421.80s -> 423.80s]  This is this is there's no reason for me to do this
[436.48s -> 439.80s]  Does that despawn?
[439.80s -> 443.32s]  All right. I gotta let me get a yoshi. Let me figure this out. There's a yoshi of egg up here, right?
[447.63s -> 449.63s]  Buy local bananas
[449.79s -> 453.90s]  All right. What do you want? Okay, you want one of those?
[455.13s -> 457.47s]  I can get you one of those
[457.47s -> 459.15s]  Can I not pick you up?
[459.15s -> 461.90s]  You can't pick the egg up. All right

[519.90s -> 521.18s]  All right. So

[533.93s -> 535.77s]  No, I can't reach that boat
[535.77s -> 539.12s]  Should I get on the okay? Wait, I can get on that boat

[1521.55s -> 1546.46s]  I can't believe it. There's a lot of winks going on right now. I thought I fell off the boat. Sorry. That was a double
[1546.86s -> 1560.30s]  Okay, get
[1560.30s -> 1562.30s]  Jesus dude. I'm not doing that
[1562.78s -> 1589.28s]  This is stupid. I have to jump from the roof
[1590.56s -> 1600.12s]  I last time I tried that I I couldn't I can't get on the roof from here press y please
[1600.76s -> 1611.20s]  Why?
[1611.20s -> 1628.91s]  I I don't care. I'm not doing this. I didn't want to be on the roof because the roof fight
[1628.99s -> 1632.35s]  That threw me off the fucking roof. Give me the exploit. What's the exploit?
[1632.67s -> 1642.92s]  Where's that? I'm going to the donations from yesterday. Where's where's the exploit to beat this? Let's watch it
[1647.93s -> 1652.60s]  Okay, get the yoshi. All right, get on yoshi
[1655.45s -> 1658.33s]  Go to uh dancing dancing. There's a dancing guy
[1658.89s -> 1662.54s]  I don't know what they're doing. You're jumping over
[1663.10s -> 1664.70s]  Uh, what was the point of that?
[1664.70s -> 1666.94s]  Where are we? We're over here. We're we're getting red
[1667.58s -> 1669.92s]  Wait, what is going on?
[1669.92s -> 1679.88s]  Okay, he just fell through the earth
[1679.88s -> 1685.80s]  So you eat a hot pepper and you jump off. It's this is immediately when the hot pepper goes towards you
[1688.00s -> 1691.60s]  And it floats in the air and then you run into this guy a couple times
[1692.81s -> 1696.01s]  And then you you run into the wall in the back
[1697.42s -> 1698.30s]  What?
[1698.30s -> 1717.45s]  Okay, i'm ready. This is you doing your chores, but you're putting your laundry under your bed
[1721.93s -> 1723.29s]  No, that's not true
[1723.29s -> 1726.73s]  That's not true because this would be way way less than 30 minutes already
[1727.61s -> 1729.61s]  It would be like two
[1729.77s -> 1747.39s]  Okay, give me
[1747.39s -> 1749.55s]  Uh, well i'm gonna go to the market
[1753.42s -> 1755.82s]  Okay, yoshi come here. There's the hot pepper
[1756.54s -> 1761.31s]  Can we see this?
[1761.31s -> 1765.07s]  Cheater cheater cheater. I'm writing this in caps because i'm angry yelling but what?
[1768.36s -> 1774.84s]  Wait, hold on. I'm writing this in caps because i'm angry or yelling
[1775.48s -> 1779.00s]  I'm not angry or yelling but merely because I think it increases the chances of you reading it
[1779.24s -> 1784.36s]  There in one of the islands there's a mountainside with a secret pipe or the secret stage that you need the rocket nozzle to reach
[1785.32s -> 1789.74s]  I mean it worked but I that's
[1790.78s -> 1795.02s]  Just hold on
[1795.02s -> 1800.12s]  It did increase the chances
[1800.12s -> 1803.72s]  Well, I thought I was gonna say like dude, you can't do this unless you have a different nozzle
[1804.36s -> 1808.04s]  I was concerned that it was it was it had to be a different nozzle
[1808.76s -> 1813.72s]  Like dude, dude, don't waste your time man
[1813.72s -> 1817.56s]  Like you you need the rocket nozzle after you jump off yoshi and you fall down to that pit
[1817.80s -> 1821.64s]  No, I don't know. Okay, here we go. Let's try it. Here we go. Let's do it. So here we go
[1885.04s -> 1892.60s]  Let me watch it again. All right floating floating pepper is there he then runs
[1893.34s -> 1895.82s]  He knocks into the fruits and it makes the guy go. Oh
[1896.86s -> 1898.22s]  And then he turns
[1898.22s -> 1901.08s]  And he just goes
[1901.08s -> 1903.96s]  It's this little spot right? Okay right here
[1919.60s -> 1921.60s]  You guys have freaked
[1921.76s -> 1940.43s]  I did it. I did it. I did it. What did I do wrong?
[1941.80s -> 1944.17s]  I did
[1945.92s -> 1949.52s]  Wait, you have to keep jumping you have to keep jumping
[1954.00s -> 1957.26s]  Okay
[1958.62s -> 1960.78s]  I just spit everywhere. All right, let's do it again
[1965.98s -> 1973.24s]  Now I got now i'm interested. What does he want for a fruit? Yeah, you want the expensive shit, don't you?
[1983.24s -> 1985.24s]  I can't believe it. Whatever
[1995.18s -> 1997.18s]  It passed they patched it yesterday
[1998.27s -> 2000.67s]  Well, at least I know where it is I don't think it's gonna be that hard to do this again
[2003.23s -> 2005.71s]  I said I didn't know how to keep jumping see what happened was
[2006.19s -> 2008.19s]  Uh, I stopped the video
[2008.96s -> 2012.16s]  Because I saw him jump a couple times and I thought he was just kind of bored jumping
[2012.96s -> 2014.72s]  You know what i'm talking about?
[2014.72s -> 2016.96s]  bored jumping where you just do this because
[2017.92s -> 2022.64s]  If you're just you don't want to walk walking is boring but going like this is fun
[2026.60s -> 2037.18s]  Okay, here we go. No, stop eating that one. What are you dumb?
[2075.13s -> 2082.09s]  Get in there. Where am I? What where did I do it? Okay. I did it. I got I got I got it. All right
[2085.68s -> 2088.00s]  Where where am I what?
[2091.95s -> 2094.38s]  Where is this?
[2100.22s -> 2102.22s]  Am I actually in the sewer
[2111.95s -> 2119.44s]  How do I get out of here? I clipped into the sewer
[2124.68s -> 2131.61s]  Get me the fuck out of here. I went too high
[2132.97s -> 2152.68s]  Let me watch this video again. There's this part. All right, so he's down he's going left
[2154.12s -> 2156.12s]  Just little short hops left
[2157.15s -> 2159.79s]  There's a little island. He's going over towards that green island
[2160.35s -> 2163.85s]  Okay, then he goes under the boat
[2163.85s -> 2194.81s]  Okay
[2194.81s -> 2202.46s]  There it is right there right there going going going going. Ah cheat harder. I'm trying to cheat as hard as I can
[2202.78s -> 2215.56s]  I'm trying to get in there. Well, there's no shame. No, there is no shame right now
[2226.70s -> 2232.84s]  Do it normally you normie wouldn't the normie way be to do it normally?
[2237.96s -> 2240.52s]  Isn't that what isn't that what normal is?
[2245.37s -> 2247.37s]  Come on get in there. I did it twice already
[2247.77s -> 2258.38s]  That's literally what he said but he was calling me a normie
[2258.38s -> 2261.98s]  So he said I should do it because that's what i'm a normie. So I should do it the normie way
[2262.62s -> 2281.98s]  Is it normal?
[2281.98s -> 2286.84s]  No, what the god why did it did the jump the second jump?
[2289.16s -> 2292.84s]  It did like the second bigger jump. I was trying to just time it so I wasn't doing it
[2293.48s -> 2308.00s]  If you bunny hop you end up doing the ha
[2309.76s -> 2311.76s]  And jump wicked high you can't bunny hop
[2316.04s -> 2318.56s]  Yoshi's dead
[2318.56s -> 2329.64s]  He's not how much time do I have before?
[2330.20s -> 2333.53s]  I'm doing this one more time. Then i'm playing again
[2333.53s -> 2338.27s]  Is it his last try final try?
[2338.43s -> 2384.70s]  And you got you can't I cannot have him do the second jump guys. Um, you hit the kill plane
[2397.52s -> 2410.78s]  The red coins of the lake invisible laser wall
[2411.98s -> 2413.98s]  Was I not doing jumping fast enough?
[2420.25s -> 2427.56s]  Do it normally no, I I don't know. I don't know either i'm not sure
[2428.28s -> 2429.88s]  Wait, I need a banana
[2429.88s -> 2436.22s]  Are there bananas over here? Are the bananas where's there a good banana?
[2442.78s -> 2446.75s]  We have bananas at home
[2446.75s -> 2448.75s]  Yeah, that that's the the grocery store shuffle
[2450.46s -> 2452.64s]  Oh, these bananas look good
[2452.64s -> 2459.04s]  Jeremy there there are seven bananas that are getting to be overripe at the house right fucking now
[2460.97s -> 2462.97s]  Oh, oh right, right, right
[2464.59s -> 2491.16s]  Banana spotted guys. He's not a chat anymore. He cannot lift nor can he play a kid's game
[2491.80s -> 2494.44s]  What did you just say?
[2494.44s -> 2502.57s]  What did he say?
[2502.57s -> 2505.32s]  Didn't think I could play a kid's game
[2505.88s -> 2508.81s]  How to get proven wrong
[2508.81s -> 2523.93s]  Mr
[2523.93s -> 2530.04s]  Jump jump. Okay, let's go. I'm just jumped off the edge
[2530.68s -> 2533.96s]  All right red coins of the lake red coins of the lake
[2534.68s -> 2540.03s]  The thing you have shoes on yoshi or you would instantly disintegrate
[2540.91s -> 2562.26s]  You can't walk on you can't walk on ropes of the yoshi. I think that's the first time i've ever tried to do that
[2567.39s -> 2575.65s]  It's not a banana. Is it you tried that? Did I try that already when did I?
[2577.76s -> 2582.16s]  Because that was like two days ago. That may that may have been like that should have that's like 10 years
[2583.42s -> 2585.18s]  In fucking streamer time
[2585.18s -> 2591.73s]  Do I even need yoshi for this? I I just saw yoshi and it was like oh
[2592.13s -> 2597.09s]  Immediately do because I just go go get fruit bring back warcraft fetch quest to get yoshi
[2597.97s -> 2609.54s]  I don't even need yoshi for this
[2609.54s -> 2639.73s]  He's gonna go to the lake. How's that not hitting them all mario broke his foot
[2640.45s -> 2643.55s]  He's all right
[2643.55s -> 2645.55s]  Okay, red coins of the lake
[2645.87s -> 2647.87s]  It's it's it's not poisonous, right?
[2648.11s -> 2654.19s]  No, this what what the why would I get what? All right, i'm i'm mad at me not at anything else
[2654.75s -> 2657.39s]  The name of this mission is called coins in the lake
[2658.03s -> 2661.55s]  Let me go get the guy that melts like fucking candy bar
[2662.96s -> 2670.18s]  When he touches water I got the wrong fucking nozzle for this, too
[2670.98s -> 2685.31s]  I gotta get the fucking other nozzle. Maybe I can just jump on the bug but that's I could just
[2685.95s -> 2710.67s]  What was that? That's a fucking illusion. Oh, it's right. It's a it's not in the water. It's above
[2711.07s -> 2725.23s]  I just got i'm the guy that would jump head first into the water. That's the mirage there it is
[2726.19s -> 2740.61s]  Clean crystal cliff fiji water bottles. Oh my god. I can't even no germa. Those are rocks
[2741.25s -> 2752.06s]  But they're not okay. There's
[2753.46s -> 2759.04s]  Probably up higher probably if I was there i'd be higher
[2776.61s -> 2777.65s]  Okay
[2777.65s -> 2794.56s]  They're definitely all the way up could they be in the line is definitely in right here. No
[2795.12s -> 2802.59s]  None of them are up here though. They must all just be down in the lake
[2802.67s -> 2821.04s]  Do I know about the infinite rocket launcher glitch? I don't uh, but as you've seen for the last 25 straight minutes
[2821.76s -> 2826.02s]  I i'm not going to just try to do an exploit. That's hard to do
[2826.74s -> 2850.32s]  I've not seen a single other red coin in this lake coins in the lake coins of the lake
[2850.88s -> 2870.78s]  This is I see two
[2870.78s -> 2877.14s]  Got a super coin. This is so frustrating. Just push the buttons
[2878.26s -> 2881.73s]  All right, fine
[2881.73s -> 2883.09s]  It didn't work
[2883.09s -> 2884.29s]  Ban that guy
[2884.29s -> 2900.78s]  Is there any shit down here? No, it's all
[2901.42s -> 2908.56s]  Where the fuck are all these things? Oh, there's a couple over here
[2910.32s -> 2912.48s]  Oh god, there's no one down in the lake
[2913.36s -> 2925.54s]  I got lied to it didn't say in the lake. Yes, it did. That's what that's what the facebook post said
[2958.62s -> 2982.43s]  Or where they don't sum up in the windmill over there. No nothing in the lake. Let's head back that way
[2997.10s -> 3003.14s]  Get the flower is there gonna flower in this one? There's no fire in this is there
[3017.42s -> 3021.65s]  corn
[3021.65s -> 3023.49s]  Watch out, dude, dude, dude
[3041.86s -> 3057.84s]  John, holy shit. What was that? We got one over there. Leave me the fuck alone. Leave me the fuck alone
[3058.16s -> 3069.98s]  I don't even want those. I just want the red ones. Excuse me. Excuse me. Get your head out of the way
[3070.38s -> 3077.30s]  What do I do with this guy? That's what you do about that guy
[3079.10s -> 3081.10s]  Crush his skull with your legs
[3081.42s -> 3092.94s]  Well, this sucks
[3092.94s -> 3095.34s]  Jesus come on get it before I get hit again
[3096.06s -> 3103.18s]  All right
[3103.18s -> 3105.18s]  Come on. Oh

[3113.46s -> 3124.86s]  It's a blue one, too
[3124.86s -> 3129.86s]  That was it's moving around. It's like it's a it's a different speed. It's a weird speed
[3134.29s -> 3138.29s]  I said I didn't see it. I didn't see it. The camera made me see it. Where was that?
[3138.93s -> 3148.14s]  Where the fuck was that? I just saw it. It's right there. Okay, come here get it
[3158.26s -> 3160.64s]  nice

[3176.64s -> 3178.64s]  Over there and go holy shit. He made it
[3179.58s -> 3181.58s]  How long streamed it up 54 minutes?
[3182.06s -> 3184.40s]  Hopefully I didn't miss anything. You didn't don't look don't watch
[3193.06s -> 3198.10s]  Bounced
[3198.10s -> 3212.16s]  Fucking bounced off the goddamn thing. Why does mario have bounced physics yodel laugh?
[3212.80s -> 3214.80s]  Stop
[3224.21s -> 3243.78s]  Give me the coin wait, is that I clean that is this cleanable? What the fuck is this?
[3248.72s -> 3267.94s]  All right, where's that coin? I'm just gonna run into it. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Come on. Where is it?
[3268.74s -> 3273.81s]  I don't know
[3273.81s -> 3284.16s]  Oh
[3285.12s -> 3286.50s]  Uh
[3286.50s -> 3319.98s]  The fuck he got all eight coins. Yep. Yeah, I gave up on the blue coin. Yeah, I did I have to move on
[3320.46s -> 3322.46s]  I can't just keep failing at something
[3327.57s -> 3352.99s]  That being said let's try the yoshi skip one more time banana. I can get you one of those blue
[3353.55s -> 3378.82s]  Blue coin over there
[3378.82s -> 3387.66s]  You know what to do. See that's what I have to be careful of is it one one two one two three
[3388.30s -> 3391.44s]  So what if I do one two one two?
[3392.16s -> 3394.16s]  One two one
[3394.64s -> 3399.52s]  Two one two one two. I think that's the way I think that's the way it is
[3400.24s -> 3401.76s]  I think that's the way you do it
[3401.76s -> 3418.48s]  Here we go. One two pause one two pause
[3434.93s -> 3439.25s]  God, you know, i've got to give some I gotta hand it to you're a speed runner of a game
[3440.85s -> 3445.26s]  And you have to do this the first time you go over here and do this
[3446.14s -> 3451.68s]  And if you do what I just did right there you turn off the whole thing
[3469.36s -> 3472.88s]  One two pause one two pause one two never do a third
[3491.63s -> 3503.89s]  One two pause one two pause. What the fuck is he doing? Oh, sorry guys. I i'm back

[3506.83s -> 3510.91s]  And I dropped my controller on the ground and it was accidentally holding right stick
[3511.87s -> 3534.85s]  Sorry
[3534.85s -> 3537.15s]  Come on didn't take this long
[3538.69s -> 3548.35s]  Never takes this long never takes this long
[3550.19s -> 3561.86s]  Oh shit, you lost your touch kid
[3582.90s -> 3614.02s]  He's dying. He's dying. I was like, I thought I was doing it like oh nice i'm doing it one two one two

[3616.26s -> 3617.70s]  one two
[3617.70s -> 3618.50s]  What?
[3618.50s -> 3630.40s]  Fuck you what?
[3630.64s -> 3634.74s]  It's the kill plane
[3634.98s -> 3639.70s]  In the movie he's doing in the movie he's jumping one
[3641.17s -> 3644.03s]  jump
[3644.03s -> 3646.43s]  He's but he's jumping high and but he's not hitting the
[3647.65s -> 3649.73s]  He's trying to I don't know what the fuck he's doing
[3650.29s -> 3653.65s]  He gets over here and he spins but yoshi's in the water. He's not dead
[3654.98s -> 3658.32s]  Oh, this is gonna be bad
[3658.32s -> 3660.32s]  Movies aren't real jeremy
[3669.30s -> 3671.54s]  Okay. Yes. Oh, okay fine
[3672.80s -> 3675.68s]  I'm going to do that. I'm going okay. I'm going to play the game
[3676.32s -> 3683.79s]  Or first let me turn my coins in
[3683.79s -> 3686.59s]  Shit, I thought I was I thought I was doing pretty well right there, too
[3687.62s -> 3690.30s]  Uh, oh well

[7014.98s -> 7016.98s]  Why did you tell him that what?
[7020.39s -> 7022.39s]  Sewer goes to the first island

[7144.07s -> 7146.26s]  It just dropped my brightness and contrast
[7169.41s -> 7170.61s]  Hmm
[7170.61s -> 7197.22s]  I can't make that jump
[7197.22s -> 7210.84s]  You missed the bus. I'm not trying to get on the bus. I'm trying to skip the first bus entirely missed a wink
[7211.16s -> 7225.11s]  Did it just throw? No, okay
[7228.55s -> 7232.07s]  Okay, that's the one right there, right? This is the one that's the one this is the one right here
[7233.22s -> 7235.62s]  I didn't get on the roof. I didn't get around do it again. Do it again, right do it again
[7235.70s -> 7237.94s]  I didn't get on the roof. Yeah, I can't get on the road. I do it again
[7245.22s -> 7249.62s]  Why why are you spending your winks? Oh because they're gonna be useless in one one day. Yeah, you're right
[7250.02s -> 7255.68s]  I think you guys would want to hold on to them too, but they're gonna be gone. Yeah, they disappear in one day
[7256.40s -> 7258.55s]  I guess that's right. That's true
[7258.55s -> 7260.07s]  I would probably do it too
[7260.07s -> 7264.07s]  And again, you could probably do it two or three times for your money on sunday
[7264.79s -> 7274.45s]  I thought you just called me wink you stalker. I was like, why am I a stalker?
[7275.57s -> 7294.98s]  All right, here we go. Gotta get on the roof on the roof. That's not even right. It's coming over here

[7376.96s -> 7378.96s]  That's a dumb question
[7378.96s -> 7381.92s]  And then on the second boat i'm gonna get in the boat not on the roof
[7386.98s -> 7390.26s]  Um when I change boats up here after I get up to the banana
[7390.90s -> 7392.82s]  Do not get on the roof
[7392.82s -> 7397.44s]  You know what I mean?
[7397.44s -> 7401.11s]  What I mean, this is the wrong boat
[7401.11s -> 7405.40s]  How could this be the wrong boat? Don't get on the roof
[7416.64s -> 7418.00s]  Stop texting me
[7418.00s -> 7422.39s]  Isn't that the problem?
[7422.39s -> 7426.95s]  How could this even be the wrong boat? What are you talking about? This is it's going the exact way I want it to go
[7427.83s -> 7438.55s]  Just get on here and then we get on the other boat and just be cautious
[7439.75s -> 7441.03s]  Be ready
[7441.03s -> 7443.11s]  Not yet
[7443.11s -> 7451.04s]  Okay, just get on this other boat

[7535.32s -> 7537.32s]  I'm just walking off the edge
[7538.40s -> 7540.80s]  I'm not jumping. I'm walking off the edge
[7546.53s -> 7548.53s]  This sucks such an ass
[7551.89s -> 7553.89s]  What do you want for a treat? Yoshi?

[7633.99s -> 7645.19s]  Calm down. It's all right
[7645.19s -> 7650.39s]  No, it's not a big deal. I'm don't be very upset by that. Yoshi's been pretending this whole time
[7653.99s -> 7660.55s]  He's not dying guys, he's just disconnecting he's ripping his fucking wi-fi cable out. It's there's a difference
[7673.28s -> 7688.42s]  Damn it, man. Get over there. I hope you make it but miss the last jumps. Don't say that
[7689.32s -> 7691.86s]  It's such a small jump
[7691.86s -> 7694.18s]  It's so small. It's just like a little
[7695.65s -> 7699.65s]  I'm trying i'm jumping a little too much and i'm just overshooting the fuck out of it. Let's take a look

[7704.77s -> 7712.84s]  You didn't have to like
[7712.84s -> 7715.48s]  This is the wrong boat. Fuck. It's the wrong boat
[7717.65s -> 7718.77s]  wrong boat
[7718.77s -> 7722.76s]  I mean everyone's saying that it has to be real if it's the wrong boat
[7724.05s -> 7726.61s]  It's just a little hop just a little pop
[7728.74s -> 7730.90s]  Just a little pop that's it
[7745.30s -> 7752.55s]  Okay, just a little pop from here. Just a little like pop just pop just a little pop

[7818.90s -> 7820.34s]  No, I already did that
[7820.34s -> 7822.47s]  But I don't know what to jump off
[7822.47s -> 7824.47s]  What what's the correct time to jump off?
[7827.36s -> 7829.36s]  And I have a better idea
[7829.70s -> 7835.54s]  Why not just put some of yoshi's spit in a bottle and dump it on there when I just take the fucking fairy
[7836.26s -> 7839.78s]  Why do we have to do all this? I just can you just spit in a bottle for me and I can dump it on there
[7840.50s -> 7845.68s]  Okay, when do I go off?

[7893.57s -> 7894.69s]  What?
[7894.69s -> 7896.93s]  Wait, it's just a water slide
[7897.73s -> 7916.28s]  I have six
[7916.28s -> 7918.28s]  This is gonna be fun
[7918.28s -> 7924.05s]  Wait back back back back it back. No, no, no back back back back back it up back it up back it up back it up
[7924.05s -> 7926.05s]  Back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up
[7926.61s -> 7942.68s]  There's a current I can salvage it. I can salvage this just
[7945.76s -> 7947.76s]  It bumped into the fucking wall
[7948.61s -> 7952.21s]  It bumped it like it did this like extreme spin
[7953.97s -> 7961.81s]  Digimon no, what's the that's the spinning tops the spinning top to our cartoon with tops spinning to each other and fucking break
[7962.37s -> 7963.73s]  What is it called?
[7963.73s -> 7966.21s]  Did what's what's it called beyblade?
[7966.85s -> 7985.99s]  This is extreme
[7986.95s -> 7988.95s]  Grab the edge grab the edge
[7989.27s -> 7994.63s]  Okay, all I care. Okay, I can just I think like some delight and I think I still do this. Does it respawn?
[7996.79s -> 7998.07s]  It's gonna respawn
[7998.07s -> 8004.15s]  It's the lily pad comes back
[8004.47s -> 8017.11s]  I it definitely does
[8017.11s -> 8018.53s]  Is it there?
[8018.53s -> 8024.88s]  There's some there's a pipe at the end of the level
[8027.01s -> 8034.31s]  Oh, I think I can get that coin
[8035.14s -> 8038.32s]  I think I can get that coin
[8038.32s -> 8051.76s]  I think I can get that coin
[8053.86s -> 8059.86s]  I can get that but I can retry. There's no reason to do that
[8060.34s -> 8064.10s]  What uh, just get the one off at least there's no reason to do what i'm doing right now
[8064.82s -> 8067.78s]  If I if I can retry it by going in the pipe then just do it
[8068.50s -> 8083.73s]  Go in the pipe what i'm going
[8088.60s -> 8094.28s]  Stop don't pipe is don't stop don't go in the pipe. No, what don't don't one guy one guy
[8094.92s -> 8096.76s]  What do you mean one guy?
[8096.76s -> 8100.08s]  Cat is lying about the pipe
[8102.26s -> 8103.94s]  That's a trap
[8103.94s -> 8108.10s]  I'm going in it. I'm fucking whatever. Okay, I i'm gonna ride it the whole time
[8108.26s -> 8113.70s]  I was looking at the chat room and I pressed the wrong tilt. I tilted a little bit extra looking at the fucking chat
[8114.10s -> 8117.70s]  And I come back and it's a little bit too far. All right, i'm just gonna go in the pipe
[8120.52s -> 8122.52s]  Just get me in the pipe
[8215.17s -> 8217.89s]  Wave of people that said go in the pipe
[8218.53s -> 8223.01s]  Brings you to the start
[8223.01s -> 8225.01s]  And then a show of people said don't
[8225.41s -> 8230.61s]  So I thought those people were just trying to be like stomp like pepe left. Don't fucking tell him to do that
[8232.58s -> 8234.76s]  Oh my god
[8235.48s -> 8237.80s]  But there were green pipes at the beginning of the level
[8238.64s -> 8244.64s]  There were there was like three green pipes that were right at the beginning and I believe the first 500 people
[8249.12s -> 8251.12s]  dude
[8251.68s -> 8253.68s]  I got actually
[8253.74s -> 8256.24s]  Extreme one guide did I
[8257.04s -> 8261.44s]  No, I didn't did I did that happen? Is that the only one I've read?
[8261.84s -> 8265.36s]  It can't be no it was more than that. It was like a thousand people
[8265.92s -> 8267.92s]  It was like a thousand people
[8271.68s -> 8274.56s]  Uh, no, it was at least at least a few hundred
[8275.94s -> 8278.50s]  It was no it wasn't one person. It can't be
[8285.94s -> 8287.94s]  Everyone was saying don't do it
[8288.34s -> 8289.78s]  Yeah
[8289.78s -> 8296.20s]  It's like the boy who cried wolf with this chat man. I'm telling you
[8298.37s -> 8301.11s]  Some people say shit. That's just fucking inaccurate
[8301.97s -> 8305.57s]  And then I go no, no, no, they're fucking with me and there's a wolf eating us
[8305.97s -> 8310.21s]  We're all being eaten. The the the chickens are all gone. The house is getting knocked. There's a
[8311.25s -> 8313.25s]  There's a the wolf is here
[8318.21s -> 8320.21s]  And now I have to do that all over again
[8320.53s -> 8322.53s]  To go back there. I'm not doing that again
[8323.41s -> 8332.20s]  Why the one guy the no the the 201 guys that were responsible for what just happened are sitting there just like
[8332.84s -> 8336.36s]  Fucking they're just rubbing their fucking hands right now. They're like, oh
[8337.96s -> 8339.92s]  We got him
[8339.92s -> 8340.88s]  so
[8340.88s -> 8360.32s]  You don't have wait what?
[8360.32s -> 8362.48s]  Oh, I don't have to use yoshi again. Oh
[8363.60s -> 8366.23s]  What?
[8366.23s -> 8368.23s]  It's I don't have to spray the thing anymore
[8369.59s -> 8371.11s]  Oh, let's go
[8371.11s -> 8376.23s]  I thought I was gonna have to spray the thing again
[8385.22s -> 8387.56s]  Going I can't I I'm seriously
[8406.66s -> 8408.66s]  Year of the bait

[8412.10s -> 8414.18s]  Is that okay? Is there anything cool I can do?
[8414.98s -> 8420.50s]  Besides the regular levels. Well, is there something else cool to check out before I stop my rest on time?
[8421.30s -> 8428.76s]  There's another this other secret another secret level. Oh the ground pound mini game. Yeah, I want to do that. Where is it?
[8436.31s -> 8440.04s]  Go to the airport go to the airport air strip
[8442.48s -> 8444.48s]  Where is the airport from here?
[8446.34s -> 8448.74s]  I haven't been back there all game. I don't even know where it is
[8449.46s -> 8479.68s]  Wait, what's that? But behind where yoshi is?
[8486.10s -> 8488.90s]  Wait, is there's more to do here smash time
[8491.44s -> 8497.60s]  Smash time. Oh fuck. Whoa, look over there. Look over there. I need a different nozzle
[8508.69s -> 8511.43s]  Eel boss. Oh, let me do this first
[8512.90s -> 8514.90s]  That's the air strip. Oh what?
[8515.62s -> 8518.07s]  nice, dude
[8518.07s -> 8520.13s]  nice
[8520.13s -> 8523.25s]  I'm just pretending to know what you're saying. What oh that's okay
[8528.50s -> 8529.94s]  Spray the beach
[8529.94s -> 8549.60s]  Okay, that's not I mean, that's kind of cool. I guess
[8550.56s -> 8554.29s]  There's more of these
[8554.29s -> 8575.40s]  Okay, cool. Okay, dude. I just found uh, I just found that star. That's like a secret star. Can we get a hype train?
[8576.04s -> 8579.86s]  I just found something that like everybody finds in when they play a game
[8580.66s -> 8583.43s]  Uh, let's start a hype
[8583.43s -> 8584.39s]  cool
[8584.39s -> 8600.58s]  scams scams
[8602.50s -> 8613.89s]  Local streamer runs scam on his audience and it's just me
[8614.53s -> 8617.33s]  It's just it's just like the
[8617.73s -> 8619.65s]  I'm completely silhouette it out
[8619.65s -> 8653.88s]  Just like this
[8655.09s -> 8656.45s]  so why
[8656.45s -> 8660.85s]  Why why did you do that? Why did you continue to try to bait people into giving you money?
[8662.29s -> 8664.02s]  well, you know, it's
[8664.02s -> 8665.70s]  honestly, it just uh
[8665.70s -> 8667.86s]  It seemed like the easiest way to just make money
[8668.74s -> 8669.62s]  I
[8669.62s -> 8673.01s]  Know if I said hey, yo, we're doing a hype train of this get hype
[8673.57s -> 8677.57s]  People who did that for hundreds of dollars would just come in so I just figured why not
[8679.96s -> 8681.96s]  What did you spend that money on?
[8683.12s -> 8686.00s]  Uh drugs a lot of it, uh, mostly drugs
[8686.98s -> 8691.06s]  I'd say 92 of all the money that came in went into drugs. I just did drugs all day
[8691.78s -> 8695.14s]  and then maybe five percent to mcdonald's and
[8696.50s -> 8702.98s]  Seven or eight percent to bills. I guess I paid some bills. I lost a lot of it too. Actually I got out of the bed and
[8703.86s -> 8705.86s]  Just kind of didn't know where it went
[8706.18s -> 8708.18s]  At least five to ten twenty percent of it
[8709.06s -> 8712.93s]  Okay, that that comes out to uh to to a hundred and twenty eight percent
[8714.45s -> 8716.85s]  Yeah, let's uh
[8716.85s -> 8718.85s]  Yeah, I would say that's accurate
[8725.17s -> 8727.14s]  and I mean
[8727.14s -> 8729.54s]  It's not like I uh, but you got you're not like showing my face, right?
[8733.48s -> 8749.70s]  I whoops. I fucked it up
[8749.70s -> 8751.70s]  There's the crack head
[8767.97s -> 8769.81s]  Why am I biting my lip?
[8769.81s -> 8772.61s]  Because I always bite my lip. I'm a constant lip biter
[8774.00s -> 8777.36s]  And I put like vaseline on it to prevent myself from doing it
[8785.99s -> 8792.20s]  What the hell is this? This is not the airstrip. This is not the airstrip
[8824.40s -> 8831.09s]  Um, let's try again, what even is this a picture of
[8862.07s -> 8870.95s]  This is not the airstrip though. It's a surf map. It kind of was a surf map
[8874.37s -> 8882.32s]  behind you
[8882.32s -> 8894.93s]  Talk to the guy behind yoshi
[8894.93s -> 8897.41s]  This guy behind yoshi, this is behind yoshi
[8899.88s -> 8902.44s]  Shall I take you out to the airstrip? It's only ten coins
[8903.16s -> 8921.04s]  We'll get ten coins
[8921.04s -> 8938.80s]  Something something and a aim. I know whatever nine really nine
[8940.71s -> 8970.90s]  Nine points because you can't put ten there. Remember reacts to only finding nine coins
[8971.46s -> 8974.21s]  That would be a slow youtube day
[8974.21s -> 8979.57s]  That would be like I have extra footage that I haven't had a video go up in like two or three weeks
[8979.89s -> 8981.89s]  And i'm just like fuck. Um
[8985.86s -> 8988.34s]  Uh auto's dog farts messing up my game
[8989.44s -> 8990.16s]  All right
[8990.16s -> 9000.45s]  What's this was it been like six days since the video went up shit? Okay, how about like a yeah, that's that sounds good
[9002.48s -> 9004.42s]  real video by the way
[9004.42s -> 9007.62s]  If some of you new reviewers real video this is real
[9008.26s -> 9024.68s]  All right back in the airstrip now what it's it's been the whole game since i've been here
[9030.90s -> 9035.54s]  Oh, no, should I come here with the nozzle the nozzle's here
[9037.51s -> 9042.28s]  Oh, thank goodness
[9042.28s -> 9055.81s]  uncensored germa
[9055.81s -> 9058.45s]  Red button. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, i'm just taking a look
[9059.25s -> 9064.82s]  What's what are these?
[9067.73s -> 9072.37s]  You can melt them. Where do I get I can get fire. Oh, you just know you just melt them
[9079.89s -> 9081.88s]  Dark matter
[9081.88s -> 9083.88s]  All right, let's do uh, i'm assuming these are coins
[9084.36s -> 9087.56s]  You might my dog my dog just farted
[9089.59s -> 9091.75s]  Stop we don't watch videos from 10 years ago
[9092.39s -> 9136.42s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on
[9160.32s -> 9184.88s]  Yes, 68 where do I want to get one more one more baby one more
[9186.00s -> 9188.24s]  one more
[9189.46s -> 9197.60s]  No, whatever anything ground pound minigame ground pound sound delay again, why does it keep happening with this game?
[9198.40s -> 9200.44s]  Where's the ground palm minigame?
[9200.44s -> 9221.76s]  It's in a building. I already got this one
[9224.68s -> 9226.92s]  house to the left of the big shine thing
[9227.96s -> 9233.48s]  It's very ella. I like your description. That's I very easy for me to understand
[9235.91s -> 9240.07s]  This thing probably has a name
[9240.15s -> 9240.95s]  like
[9240.95s -> 9245.75s]  Shiny mount stadium or something but like a big shine star thing. I know what that is
[9246.23s -> 9255.28s]  Now it's building over there. Okay, actually I might have the wrong thing for this
[9283.44s -> 9294.72s]  Oh wait, can I go through this? I hear one. Why do I hear one? Okay
[9295.91s -> 9300.98s]  Uh building here it is
[9300.98s -> 9304.82s]  Break all the crates within 30 seconds to win a prize. You want to try? Yeah, sure
[9305.70s -> 9336.16s]  That was great. You're the best three misses and I died. It's fine
[9338.60s -> 9340.60s]  69 shines
[9345.00s -> 9347.32s]  We did it. Yeah, we did it. Hooray
[9348.04s -> 9355.38s]  Ha ha ha ha
[9355.38s -> 9358.34s]  This crap everybody laughed really hard
[9359.14s -> 9361.83s]  Come on, let me make it even funnier
[9369.68s -> 9371.68s]  Why did I spend any of these blue coins?
[9381.16s -> 9387.24s]  I mean too bad. It wasn't
[9387.46s -> 9389.46s]  69 three times
[9390.12s -> 9392.52s]  Right. That would have been pretty funny
[9395.27s -> 9399.99s]  Actually, that kind of would have been pretty funny considering it would have taken me so much longer to beat the game
[9400.31s -> 9406.95s]  Because at least seven or eight of these stars or ten of them are blue coin stars. I hear this thing
[9408.26s -> 9409.46s]  Where is it?
[9409.46s -> 9447.72s]  Can I not how do I get in here? All right this guy?
[9449.00s -> 9453.38s]  This guy's a chuckster
[9453.38s -> 9494.24s]  Oh, howdy throw me a coin. I'll throw you for a loop. Ah, anyway, here you go. Okay
[9495.62s -> 9497.30s]  We are gonna
[9497.30s -> 9499.30s]  Take a quick little break. I'm gonna go pee
[9499.38s -> 9501.14s]  We're gonna change
[9501.14s -> 9503.14s]  To something what do I what do I want to do?
[9505.06s -> 9507.78s]  The we the game cube shit's already hooked up and it's already set
[9508.50s -> 9511.62s]  So I might just maybe play a Wii game or something play another game cube game
[9511.94s -> 9516.98s]  Because it would be i'd have to switch out a bunch of cables
[9517.54s -> 9526.37s]  And recalibrate some stuff to change anything else. Uh, let me take a look. See what I got. I'll be right back
