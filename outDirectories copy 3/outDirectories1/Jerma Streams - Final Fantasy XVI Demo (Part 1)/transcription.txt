[11.77s -> 29.32s]  All right, I am back. I need to go this way. Grab this. How are you? You guys ready?
[29.32s -> 35.02s]  Final Fantasy 16. We're gonna watch a trailer. I think this is a live action trailer. This was
[35.02s -> 45.78s]  uploaded yesterday. Let me just tweet my tweet. Hey, there's a new sponsor tweet incoming. New
[45.78s -> 64.63s]  sponsor tweet. Are you serious? Okay. Wait, hold on. What is this one? Hotel fridges are just
[64.71s -> 69.27s]  freezers. Don't fuck around. That sandwich you put in there. Is it going to turn into a Jimmy
[69.27s -> 83.30s]  Dean's breakfast sandwich? That's pretty good. I'm just looking at my drafts right now. That's
[83.30s -> 94.62s]  actually a pretty good one. He's always dry. He's dumping the drafts right now. No, these,
[94.62s -> 105.59s]  no, they're not drunk tweets. Oh, this one's actually for, I will go over this after the sponsor.
[106.15s -> 119.19s]  Because this one, I got, I got a story to tell you after this. All right. Let me tweet this. Make
[119.19s -> 124.25s]  sure it looks right. You tell me if it looks good on Twitter. Look at how active my Twitter
[124.25s -> 133.88s]  is today. You've seen this activity. This is two, this is two or three tweets in one day. Look at
[133.88s -> 140.86s]  me now. Look at what I'm doing. Look at me. Look at what I'm doing now. Actually using Twitter.
[141.42s -> 162.97s]  Look at me. Okay. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty good. I'm just somebody shut up.
[166.23s -> 185.46s]  Everything work the 34 seconds ago. Shut up. Hi. Okay. All right. Let's watch the trailer. This is
[185.46s -> 194.26s]  the final fantasy 16 Requiem live action trim. Actually, I've not seen this. So let's see the
[194.26s -> 206.97s]  music off. Let's get comfortable. Let's get this. I'm going to turn the lights off. Everything seems
[206.97s -> 222.63s]  pretty solid. Uh, oh, there we go. I had to quit the game. Speak up. This is not it. I was still
[222.63s -> 237.77s]  in the other game. Get out of this. All right. It is time to watch the final fantasy 16 live
[237.77s -> 247.51s]  action trailer. Thank you by the way, Square Enix and final fantasy 16, sponsoring the segment of
[247.51s -> 268.57s]  the stream. You ready? I wonder how this, I wonder how this is. Here we go. Oh my God. Violence, blood,
[269.13s -> 279.43s]  sexual themes, nudity, strong language. All right. Okay. Are you guys ready to watch? Make
[279.43s -> 327.90s]  sure the audio is in a good spot. Here we go. Dog. Of course you walked by the blacksmith.
[327.90s -> 442.74s]  Everybody's playing music. Okay.
[474.46s -> 511.45s]  Shit. Oh my God. He went flying. He flew in there. There it was. Final fantasy 16. I've got a PS5
[511.45s -> 524.57s]  right now. Very excited. You ready to check out the demo? Let's fucking go. All right.
[524.57s -> 530.15s]  Bear with me for a second. I've never used a PlayStation. Hope I did all this right.
[531.08s -> 537.30s]  I've never used a PlayStation 5. I've played it one time with italics because he showed me that
[537.30s -> 557.29s]  the trigger buttons are cool. All right. Let's go see if I did this right. I think I did. Can
[557.29s -> 575.03s]  you guys hear it? Wait, it's coming through my TV. Hold on. I got to fix this. All right.
[575.03s -> 578.79s]  Give me one second. It's coming through my TV. It's not coming through my headphones.
[579.43s -> 589.08s]  Can you hear this, the music? It's like playing the intro. All right. Hold on. I got to move this.
[590.34s -> 618.95s]  Why is it going through my TV? There we go. Now I can hear it. Noise? What do you mean worse noise?
[618.95s -> 644.70s]  All right. Here we go. It's time. Square Enix. I do have to do this though. All right. Progress
[644.70s -> 649.50s]  is saved automatically. This demo features several chapters of Final Fantasy 16's first act. All
[649.50s -> 656.41s]  saved progress can be carried over to the main game. We hope you enjoy your time in Valisthia.
[656.41s -> 661.43s]  That's actually pretty good. That's cool. I'm glad you can actually save your progress.
[662.63s -> 669.27s]  Also, if you don't know, Final Fantasy 16, you don't need to know 15 games worth of story.
[670.79s -> 676.79s]  I think that's pretty obvious at this point. Otherwise, I don't know if I would have wanted
[676.79s -> 684.44s]  to play every single story for Final Fantasy, with the exception of a few, is different. This
[684.44s -> 690.02s]  one is no different. All right. Subtitles are going to stay on. Vibrations are going to keep
[690.02s -> 700.89s]  it on. What about brightness? Does this look good? A bit more? What do you guys think? I think it's
[700.89s -> 706.06s]  good right where it was. Game performance. Graphics or frame rate? I don't know. I don't
[706.06s -> 713.70s]  know really what this means. I have a PS5. Should I do graphics or frame rate? Maybe graphics.
[713.70s -> 728.33s]  Frame rate? This is probably fine. Story focused or action focused? Gameplay focused does not affect
[728.33s -> 732.33s]  story content. Mode can be changed after starting game. All right. So we're doing action, of course.
[732.33s -> 744.04s]  Screen brightness five. This is all sounds pretty good. Subtitles are on. Okay.
[755.80s -> 761.53s]  Is blessed in the light of the mother crystals and that it was this light
[762.62s -> 768.86s]  which finally led our forebears out of the darkness. Creative business unit. Great. What
[768.86s -> 779.08s]  they saw in the light gave rise to temptation. Temptation that ever lures us back into the
[779.08s -> 786.92s]  crystal shadow. And thus did our journey begin. Oh, that final fantasy. That final fantasy
[786.92s -> 833.74s]  soundtrack is already bumping. What just happened? Fireball? Wait, I have to evade. I'm playing the
[833.74s -> 856.55s]  game now. Spam fireball. Evade. Did I do it? Yeah, there's bird mode. I think I have to time it.
[857.19s -> 902.74s]  There it is. PS5 looks pretty good. It's a three year old console. Yeah, I mean,
[902.74s -> 938.58s]  I have never seen it before. Year of the realm 873 nicer. So what? What character am I? Do I
[938.58s -> 952.50s]  choose one or am I? You all know the target. She was dominant and only the dominant. No one else.
[953.46s -> 962.49s]  Where's the fun in that? That's me, right? The girl will be among them. Our kind do not question
[962.49s -> 978.30s]  orders. We follow them. Try to keep that in mind. Let's get this done. Yeah, I can't wait. I hope
[978.86s -> 1004.62s]  that makes an appearance. True. Yeah, true. Yeah. So from my understanding, this game is different
[1004.62s -> 1018.33s]  than the other ones. It's not turn based. It's like action based, right? I'm very curious what
[1018.33s -> 1033.58s]  that means. Focus Wyvern. You are key to this mission success. Okay. Yes, sir. Final fantasy
[1033.58s -> 1051.48s]  hasn't been turned based in like a decade. I said focus Wyvern. All right. Fly. Wait, the main menu.
[1051.48s -> 1055.80s]  Press whatever that button is at any time outside a cut scene to open the main menu.
[1056.89s -> 1062.09s]  Gameplay configuration settings, including camera inversion can also be adjusted on the system tab.
[1062.09s -> 1067.45s]  We don't have time for this. All hell is about to break loose. I want to look at the scenery.
[1068.09s -> 1096.54s]  It's pretty good. Is there a run? All right. Tilt gently to walk. Here we go. Jump faster if you do
[1096.54s -> 1112.73s]  this. We're just in time. Do it gently. Do we have to fight all that? Look in army frontline.
[1116.62s -> 1160.46s]  Turn it up. Am I going to fight in a big fucking battle? Turn it up now. Now it's too quiet.
[1160.86s -> 1171.43s]  They won't need this new dominant of theirs. I can't wait to go.
[1171.43s -> 1196.34s]  Stronghold. What do you mean you refuse? We refuse. Did you not pledge your swords for our cause?
[1197.54s -> 1205.93s]  Oh, new characters. Come now, Marshal. The king of Walud is our guest.
[1216.95s -> 1231.53s]  And you have his majesty's answer. Oh, damn it. There's a huge ass table.
[1232.49s -> 1253.74s]  You can't do much at a table like that. What was that? I wonder that you summoned us at all.
[1253.74s -> 1265.00s]  Cigarette stream. Vape. It was the Dalmex who drove back the crusaders in the Battle of the Twin
[1265.00s -> 1279.45s]  Realms, was it not? Or am I mistaken? Besides, your dominant has yet to take the field.
[1283.29s -> 1287.13s]  And when he does, our knights would only get in the way.
[1289.00s -> 1293.00s]  Perhaps you have not heard, but the Ironblood now have their own dominant.
[1293.96s -> 1298.68s]  We would be fools to underestimate them. Bugger their knights. What did you say?
[1299.32s -> 1304.07s]  Oh, yeah. Should this citadel be allowed to fall?
[1305.70s -> 1311.86s]  Holy shit, this guy's fucking huge. The capital will lie exposed. He's like eight people. I,
[1311.86s -> 1315.94s]  okay, I did not know how big this guy was. The crusaders will wait for the good king's
[1315.94s -> 1334.14s]  pawns to line up before taking to the board. Why? Which just leaves me. That's so rude.
[1336.36s -> 1345.22s]  The Ironblood will rule the day they set foot on Storm. This game is over.
[1348.66s -> 1365.30s]  All right, so who's ass do I have to kick? You cock.
[1371.70s -> 1385.72s]  Benedict. Take care. Does the lion take care when he chases the hare?
[1386.44s -> 1394.81s]  Or do you think me one of the latter? No, my love. You are a lion. You're my lion.
[1397.29s -> 1402.57s]  I'm not afraid of a little frost, Benedicta. This guy is so, he's just...
[1410.30s -> 1421.96s]  Do I have to kick, do I have to kick that guy's ass? The front lines are gone.
[1421.96s -> 1457.43s]  18 plus and smoking. All right, cool. Okay, what's the first thing I got? You gotta give me like a
[1457.43s -> 1465.86s]  skeleton to kill, right? One skeleton is going to be like... Clive, be careful. That skeleton will
[1465.86s -> 1484.31s]  take you down in one swing. There's always a singular skeleton. As always, take the van.
[1484.31s -> 1496.38s]  Everyone we talked about what it would sound like if I had everyone, if I could hear everybody on
[1496.38s -> 1513.78s]  the stream. Okay, look at what it sounds like. Well, not like that. Oh shit. What was that?
[1516.86s -> 1523.58s]  There's the one skeleton. Oh no, that's quite the one skeleton for the tutorial.
[1537.98s -> 1544.73s]  All right, it's, I turned it up. So it's going to be loud. We're enjoying it. Just be aware. The
[1544.81s -> 1567.80s]  volume, you should adjust your volume. I turned it up. Oh, wait, are those chocobos?
[1601.06s -> 1606.33s]  I thought he was making that sound with his mouth. I think he was.
[1635.72s -> 1661.59s]  Let's go. Move. Oh, God. Wait, is this a, is that person bad? Okay, I think that person's bad.
[1662.47s -> 1669.91s]  Who's on, what team am I on? I don't know what team I'm on. Am I on team ice or team big gigantic
[1669.91s -> 1683.61s]  guy? It's hard to tell. Okay. All right. I'm liking this more and more as we go.
[1703.48s -> 1720.47s]  That's what I would say in that situation. Oh, a hundred percent. I'm glad that they're,
[1720.47s -> 1726.07s]  they're doing that instead of being like, Oh, whoa, better look out. No, you'd be like, fuck,
[1726.39s -> 1743.78s]  please help me. Please. God help me. What the, Oh, that guy got crushed. Oh, that's not good.
[1746.01s -> 1772.42s]  Wyvern, I told you before you do not get to die here. That's pretty awful. Oh,
[1791.90s -> 1810.10s]  now we're probably going to see some 13 summers earlier. There's always work for you in the
[1810.10s -> 1815.46s]  stables. Unless of course you think you can defend your master while sat on your ass in a puddle of
[1815.54s -> 1821.62s]  pigs. Well, I'm sure he'd find a way. My brother always looks after me. Right.
[1822.74s -> 1837.30s]  Go on. You're sure to hit him eventually. Don't give up now. I was going to say it's definitely
[1837.30s -> 1853.19s]  a wooden sword. All right. Wooden sword training. Here we go. All right. Start again from the
[1853.19s -> 1863.59s]  beginning. Show me your form. Attack the Lord commander. So square to perform melee attack
[1863.59s -> 1871.00s]  up to four attacks can be chained together. So don't don't don't don't. Okay. There is a lock on
[1872.36s -> 1888.20s]  again. Is there a dodge roll? Very good. Such swordsmanship will serve you well in the field,
[1888.76s -> 1894.12s]  but can the same be said of your spell craft? The flames of the phoenix burn within you.
[1894.92s -> 1902.12s]  Now let them burn without. You're an eye frame crackhead. Green fire down upon me.
[1903.26s -> 1911.64s]  Yeah, I kind of am. Okay. Triangle to cast fire. A range spell that can strike enemies from great
[1911.64s -> 1933.45s]  distances. Okay. I wonder if you can be like a mage. Well done. You wield the firebird's flames
[1933.45s -> 1940.25s]  just as a first shield should. You flatter me, my lord. Or would you rather I flattened you?
[1941.21s -> 1947.29s]  It can be arranged. Let's see if you can elude my blade. Plus one foe letter grade incoming.
[1947.29s -> 1951.37s]  Your attacking prowess will count for naught if you don't live long enough to use it.
[1952.01s -> 1963.13s]  On your toes, Lord Rossfield. Hmm. Stay quick on your feet. Evade four times. R1 to evade an
[1963.13s -> 1969.13s]  enemy's attack. Evading an attack at the precise moment it is dealt will temporarily slow the enemy,
[1969.13s -> 1980.87s]  making it more susceptible to a counter. All right. Cool. Come on. Dodge that. Because I'm a gamer.
[1984.41s -> 1999.66s]  Nice try. Good. Remember, Clive, your blade is not your only weapon.
[2000.38s -> 2006.54s]  Use your thought and flitness of foot are indispensable arms in any shield. Use your
[2006.54s -> 2011.98s]  voice and your intelligence to get out of issues. Show me what sets you apart from the rest.
[2012.94s -> 2020.06s]  You have been blessed by the phoenix. Granted the use of its power. Call upon that power now
[2020.06s -> 2032.58s]  to close on me. Well, I'm waiting. Close the gap. The blessing of the phoenix grants Clive
[2032.58s -> 2040.49s]  the ability to perform feats of inhuman strength and dexterity. Phoenix Shift is one such iconic
[2040.49s -> 2048.52s]  feat. Press circle to swiftly close in on a distant target. Both melee and ranged attacks
[2048.52s -> 2069.19s]  can be used while executing a phoenix shift. So it's like a super dodge. Impressive. But even
[2069.19s -> 2075.93s]  the most agile shield cannot hope to escape every blow. And death may come by a handful of cuts as
[2076.01s -> 2082.63s]  easily as it comes by a thousand. There is only one way to ensure that you do not fall.
[2083.43s -> 2091.18s]  Give your wounds mended and your energies replenished. Okay. Speaking of which, my lord,
[2091.74s -> 2100.84s]  you seem a little worse for wear. Now that won't do at all. Healing menu I'm imagining use potions.
[2101.48s -> 2107.27s]  Consumable items such as potions and tonics can be used to restore Clive's HP or temporarily
[2107.27s -> 2115.50s]  boost attributes. Consumables can be assigned to up right down via the items tab in the main menu
[2115.50s -> 2122.10s]  for a quick and convenient use. These items can be also used directly from the menu. Okay. So I'm
[2122.10s -> 2131.02s]  imagining this probably I'm just trying not to burp it. I'm trying to keep it in. Okay. So you can
[2131.02s -> 2139.40s]  assign stuff but I already have potion. There it is. You can really spam it too. Okay. That's better.
[2140.28s -> 2147.83s]  Battle is a succession of pivotal moments where in life and death can be decided at a single
[2147.83s -> 2155.67s]  stroke funny voice every tool at your disposal. If you are to navigate can be both to victory
[2156.31s -> 2164.78s]  or at the very least to ensure that you live to fight another day. Enough practice. It's time for
[2164.78s -> 2167.98s]  the test. I'm going to stop this guy. You recovered from your soaking I trust.
[2168.86s -> 2175.82s]  You wouldn't want to kick a man while he's drowned. I thought you'd never ask. Come then Lord Rosfield.
[2176.70s -> 2182.30s]  Spar with me. If you believe yourself worthy to be called shield of the flame then prove it
[2184.04s -> 2188.04s]  as you wish my lord. I'm so much stronger than you. So much better than you and so much older than
[2188.04s -> 2193.32s]  you and so much more wise. Well done boy. Well done.
[2195.48s -> 2203.90s]  Oh music. The will gauge indicates an opponent's will to fight back.
[2203.90s -> 2207.02s]  Break their spirit by landing attacks and strike them when they are vulnerable.
[2209.16s -> 2220.94s]  Okay. All right. Back it up.
[2221.34s -> 2249.62s]  You're serious. Okay. Jump. This is oh staggering your enemies. Lord Murdoch's will has been broken
[2249.62s -> 2253.38s]  leaving him staggered. Try dealing as much damage as you can before he regains his senses.
[2253.38s -> 2260.26s]  Use R2 plus squared execute rising flames a powerful iconic ability. Okay. So when they're down go.
[2260.42s -> 2273.51s]  When I used all the tools at my disposal.
[2290.68s -> 2299.34s]  Cool. Oh let's go. Yeah.
[2312.26s -> 2318.18s]  I probably would rebind. I'm going to rebind circle to dodge and R1 to be that move.
[2319.16s -> 2321.64s]  Just burned in my brain. That circle is always just dodge.
[2325.29s -> 2330.47s]  It's taken me long enough. That was a display worthy of your father.
[2330.47s -> 2334.95s]  There's already enough option for that. Okay. You are a true shield of the flame and let no one
[2334.95s -> 2357.02s]  tell you otherwise. Including me. What are you? Back to your drills. I was watching the vaude.
[2357.02s -> 2374.84s]  Meanwhile you're live. We're live right now. Final fantasy 16. Good demo. Do you think that hurt?
[2374.84s -> 2382.97s]  I was just tired. Phoenix's flames are a gift. You mustn't waste them. It isn't a waste. My
[2382.97s -> 2390.57s]  shields look after me. Why shouldn't I? That's why you were coughing this morning too.
[2391.53s -> 2398.25s]  You shouldn't be outdoors. It's just a cold. Don't push yourself. I wonder how the party
[2398.25s -> 2404.01s]  system will be in this game. Will it be party based? Do you swap between characters or just
[2404.01s -> 2417.22s]  play as one character? I wonder. I'm curious. Your grace. I would gladly brave hell itself
[2417.22s -> 2427.32s]  to see my darling boy. Okay. Gentlemen, Rosaria thanks you for your indefatigable loyalty.
[2427.32s -> 2442.55s]  Thank you, your grace. We live to serve. Joshua, you should not be out of doors.
[2443.35s -> 2461.56s]  We have discussed this. I'm sorry. Good day to you, mother. Come, Joshua.
[2462.38s -> 2468.22s]  Your father will be expecting us. Leather noise. Yeah, the leather noise.
[2470.22s -> 2487.35s]  Lord Murdock. Your grace. That was way worse. What a way to treat your own flesh and blood.
[2487.91s -> 2493.08s]  I know. It's not his fault. Not everyone can be born the phoenix.
[2493.96s -> 2498.92s]  You should just wear a big leather coat one day. I don't think I want to do that
[2499.88s -> 2518.22s]  in Las Vegas. That does not sound fun. Yeah, I've got a great idea. What is it? 120 degrees outside?
[2518.22s -> 2541.02s]  Yeah, give me a big leather coat. A regal, a regal chocobo. Look at how regal that chocobo is walking.
[2553.45s -> 2565.75s]  Rise, my friends. Welcome home, father. Thank you, Joshua. Would I look good in red? You are well
[2565.83s -> 2570.63s]  adressed. What do you guys think? Yes, father. Much better. I don't know. I don't think I could pull
[2570.63s -> 2585.72s]  red off. Is that so? Yeah, I'm definitely more of a blue gray. You'll make a fine purple. I like
[2585.72s -> 2601.91s]  purple too. Lift up your head, girl. Thank you, your grace. You were in red for that show you were in
[2602.07s -> 2616.46s]  the week. That was a puzzler, though. War is coming, my boy. You must make ready. Is the situation
[2616.46s -> 2630.74s]  truly so grave? Come to the throne room. We will top there. Yes, father. Your grace. Shields dismissed.
[2631.62s -> 2646.04s]  That didn't even hurt. Your grace. What does your grace mean? Your grace. Does that mean like
[2646.92s -> 2657.67s]  I find you to be your very like your bright and your grace, your honor? Like it's my honor to be
[2657.67s -> 2672.25s]  in your presence or something. What does it mean? Your grace, your honor. It's like bowing. Okay,
[2672.25s -> 2681.93s]  yeah. They were considered holy. God's grace. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, should you
[2681.93s -> 2688.26s]  find yourself lost, do not fret. Hold down L3 and trust in your animal instinct to point you in the
[2688.26s -> 2692.34s]  right direction. Your current destination will be displayed. All right, yeah, don't worry. I know
[2692.34s -> 2699.51s]  where we're going. I will tell you, though, if me and Holly were ever lost and I looked over and I
[2699.51s -> 2705.69s]  said, hey, don't worry, honey. We'll just trust my animal instinct. We'll get there. I don't know if
[2705.69s -> 2716.90s]  we'll get there or not. I just start like sniffing. Wait, where are we going? Okay, cool. So, let's see.
[2718.90s -> 2721.30s]  I'm not sure. I need to speak with father.
[2727.22s -> 2733.54s]  All right, what's this? Secret useful items can be found across the realm by those who know where
[2733.54s -> 2748.42s]  to look. Okay, what is this? A potion. Should I walk? We should probably RP walk, right? Make
[2748.42s -> 2766.02s]  for the throne room. Just skipping to the throne room. Close the gates. Let's hope the side entrance
[2766.02s -> 2779.62s]  is still open. I actually kind of like moving around like this. All right, would anybody feel
[2779.62s -> 2793.72s]  like, hey, stop doing that. That's skipping. Stop having so much fun Clive. What do you think you're
[2793.72s -> 2816.58s]  doing? Good as new. Forgive me. Your grace, you just put more bacteria on it and kind of dirty too.
[2817.62s -> 2828.25s]  Why do people keep doing that? It doesn't do anything. It was no trouble. Really? Oh, do not
[2828.25s -> 2835.05s]  indulge him. To be allowed to stand in your lordship's presence is more than his kind deserves.
[2835.05s -> 2840.81s]  Why? Neither the empire nor the republic treat their bearers half so well. He was lucky to be
[2840.81s -> 2852.58s]  born in your father's dominion. Very lucky as I remind him every day. Imagine seeing your lord
[2852.58s -> 2859.14s]  just skipping around through town. It'd be like, oh, I'd be like, all right, at least he's happy. At
[2859.14s -> 2867.16s]  least the lord is happy. I trust his good fortune will continue. Of course, if that is your lordship's
[2867.16s -> 2875.48s]  wish. Don't work too hard. Remember, it is for the good of the dodgy that you serve. It goes the
[2875.48s -> 2890.49s]  baker with the tray up. As do we all, my lord. As do we all. Come along now to your duties.
[2905.11s -> 2926.49s]  Yeah, get back to what you were doing. And by the way, it's always lord. Good day.
[2927.05s -> 2938.95s]  Looks like they're getting ready for supper. I think someone's hungry. I see a lot of minus
[2938.95s -> 2947.03s]  dudes. It's always lord. What kind of dialogue was that? By the way, it's always lord. Yeah, no,
[2947.03s -> 2950.31s]  that's what they called him. That's literally what they said. Both said it. Why am I acting like they
[2950.31s -> 2965.93s]  didn't say that? The optimal way to travel. Nice and quiet in here, isn't it? Oh, I just love the flower.
[2967.05s -> 2974.66s]  There's Joshua. Does anybody else feel like they can skip faster than they can run?
[2976.71s -> 2980.31s]  I really think I can. I think if I was in a full sprint versus a full skip,
[2980.31s -> 2985.43s]  I would be able to do, I would go faster skipping. That child is the future of our nation.
[2988.73s -> 2999.50s]  Oh no, am I? Some large gates and stiff levers require extra effort to operate.
[2999.50s -> 3009.40s]  Use X to access them and then hold R2 to push. Oh, whoops. Dude, this, oh, this is weird. The
[3009.40s -> 3019.82s]  PlayStation 5 has this, it's giving me, it's like feedback. I actually have to press this kind of
[3019.82s -> 3062.22s]  like hard. Whoa, cool. Whoa, whoa. Good luck. What's going on here? You commanded my presence,
[3062.22s -> 3069.40s]  your grace. How may I serve you? All right, you can stop licking my boots.
[3070.04s -> 3076.36s]  Your mother isn't here. Do the territories fare any better?
[3080.82s -> 3087.83s]  Most lie under a pall of black. In just these few moons, the blight has taken lie on all of
[3087.83s -> 3094.12s]  the northern reaches. It is only a matter of time before it crosses the border.
[3098.12s -> 3101.56s]  Nearly every available bed in the capital is already occupied by those fleeing the
[3101.56s -> 3108.79s]  deadlands. Even if we were to send themself to Port Isolde, more would only follow in their wake.
[3110.76s -> 3114.28s]  Every day we delay brings us closer to disaster.
[3114.28s -> 3117.80s]  Every throne I've seen looks really uncomfortable to sit in.
[3117.80s -> 3120.92s]  Against the Iron Kingdom. Did anybody ever have like a comfortable
[3120.92s -> 3124.20s]  fucking throne? They made like soft pillows and shit.
[3124.20s -> 3127.86s]  We have traded blows with them for too long. It is time to end it.
[3129.62s -> 3135.91s]  At the very least, we must secure Drake's breath. Without the blessing of the Mother Crystal,
[3135.91s -> 3138.47s]  we cannot defend our realm from the spread of the blight.
[3139.19s -> 3146.60s]  The Iron Blood will not relinquish it easily. This will be a bitter fight.
[3148.34s -> 3153.29s]  We ride for Phoenix Gate tomorrow. There we will listen to the words of our ancestors.
[3153.29s -> 3154.73s]  Horse mechanic? As tradition dictates.
[3155.37s -> 3158.28s]  Am I to go with you as Joshua Shield?
[3158.84s -> 3161.19s]  There was no ergonomics back then.
[3166.68s -> 3168.68s]  And I feel like the first order of business for me would be
[3168.68s -> 3170.60s]  get me a pillow to put under my ass to sit on.
[3170.60s -> 3172.28s]  You will have heard the reports, I am sure,
[3172.28s -> 3175.24s]  of beast men from the north being sighted within our borders.
[3175.96s -> 3179.72s]  Goblins in the Stillwind Marshes. I know of the rumors, yes.
[3180.52s -> 3184.55s]  Then you know what must be done. I will give you two good men.
[3185.75s -> 3186.63s]  Royal ass pillow.
[3186.63s -> 3189.35s]  While we ride north tomorrow, you will journey to Stillwind.
[3189.35s -> 3193.83s]  Search it and clear it. Then you will join us at Phoenix Gate.
[3194.87s -> 3207.70s]  It is time to prove your strength and shut your mother up for good.
[3212.06s -> 3219.03s]  I will do my duty, Your Grace.
[3219.75s -> 3224.47s]  Okay, good. I'm so ready.
[3227.69s -> 3231.45s]  That will be all. Rest well. We ride at dawn.
[3233.98s -> 3235.34s]  Yes, Your Grace.
[3237.11s -> 3240.57s]  Again, this is the demo. Get it right now.
[3240.57s -> 3241.07s]  PS5.
[3244.81s -> 3251.94s]  Active Time Lore. Hold that to access the Active Time Lore feature,
[3251.94s -> 3255.22s]  a compilation of important information relevant to Clive's current story progression.
[3256.87s -> 3260.07s]  ATL can even be viewed during most cutscenes.
[3260.07s -> 3262.79s]  What does that mean?
[3264.33s -> 3265.05s]  Oh, okay.
[3265.69s -> 3269.70s]  So it's important people and this is actually good
[3269.70s -> 3274.81s]  because I forget literally every single person's name.
[3274.81s -> 3280.68s]  Okay, cool.
[3280.68s -> 3286.23s]  Wait, did they actually add the caveman mode I was talking about?
[3286.23s -> 3287.64s]  Is this in the game?
[3287.64s -> 3290.36s]  Didn't I talk about how much I fucking wanted this so bad?
[3290.36s -> 3292.34s]  How badly I wanted this?
[3292.34s -> 3296.23s]  It's a paragraph to explain just here it is.
[3296.23s -> 3298.55s]  Hey, look. Look, there's like three sentences.
[3298.55s -> 3304.98s]  There's a lore button where you can just read like one small paragraph.
[3305.62s -> 3309.35s]  Okay, I'm happy about that.
[3309.99s -> 3317.19s]  Okay, retire to your chambers.
[3317.75s -> 3325.72s]  Hey, Dodd. What do you think of my training?
[3326.28s -> 3355.53s]  How do I get out of here? How do I get up there?
[3356.17s -> 3372.41s]  Oh, this way. The castle's nice.
[3376.17s -> 3380.25s]  Will you still be skipping as him 15 years later?
[3380.25s -> 3383.93s]  That's a core part of my character's personality right now.
[3383.93s -> 3385.13s]  Do you think I'm going to stop doing that?
[3385.77s -> 3413.83s]  How long will you be away this time?
[3415.61s -> 3419.77s]  Not long. Four days. Maybe five.
[3422.49s -> 3424.09s]  And you will be taking Joshua?
[3425.29s -> 3427.69s]  Well, I can't exactly leave him behind, can I?
[3428.33s -> 3431.80s]  The blood of the Rosfields runs in his veins.
[3432.60s -> 3436.12s]  Let me ask, does the demo have a lot of cutscene stuff?
[3436.12s -> 3438.60s]  Yeah, I think it's starting to build up the story.
[3438.60s -> 3442.36s]  Only the dominant can enter the apothecary, so yes, I'm taking Joshua.
[3444.36s -> 3448.44s]  Your demo progress does carry on to the main game when it releases itself.
[3448.44s -> 3458.34s]  I don't know that. The boy is also the phoenix, the heir to the throne.
[3458.34s -> 3461.06s]  You can't keep him in swaddling clothes all of his life.
[3463.46s -> 3466.42s]  Don't worry. Clive will watch over him.
[3467.70s -> 3468.74s]  Can you skip in the full game?
[3468.74s -> 3472.34s]  As a youth of but 15 years, he's already a fine soldier.
[3472.98s -> 3474.34s]  He will make a splendid shield.
[3474.98s -> 3475.94s]  Yes, you can.
[3475.94s -> 3478.90s]  You see more in him than the phoenix did.
[3478.90s -> 3480.66s]  He was rejected, Elwyn.
[3481.93s -> 3484.33s]  Our household has no place for such a failure.
[3484.33s -> 3486.57s]  He is worthless, a man like any other.
[3488.95s -> 3491.03s]  As am I, my dear.
[3492.81s -> 3496.73s]  Nonsense. You are the archduke of Rosaria.
[3496.73s -> 3497.53s]  Not this again.
[3498.49s -> 3502.36s]  You know, as well as I do, that I only sit upon the throne
[3502.36s -> 3504.52s]  because my father was taken before his time.
[3505.16s -> 3510.42s]  I am merely warming the seat till Joshua comes of age.
[3512.95s -> 3515.59s]  You are your father's firstborn son.
[3516.71s -> 3518.31s]  And you sit upon the throne.
[3520.12s -> 3521.72s]  All is in its right place.
[3522.52s -> 3527.02s]  And my son, you have not disgraced our noble blood.
[3527.74s -> 3533.66s]  Without men like Clive to keep us safe, your precious noble.
[3536.06s -> 3536.86s]  Who are these people?
[3538.86s -> 3539.36s]  Okay.
[3541.10s -> 3544.54s]  Look at how fucking perfect that thing really is.
[3545.27s -> 3546.23s]  This is great.
[3546.23s -> 3548.84s]  In the middle of the cutscene, I can be like, wait.
[3548.84s -> 3551.08s]  Okay, this is Annabelle of Rossfield.
[3551.08s -> 3552.76s]  Duchess of Rosaria.
[3552.76s -> 3556.20s]  Wife of Archduke Elwyn and mother to Clive and Joshua.
[3556.20s -> 3557.07s]  Perfect.
[3559.05s -> 3560.49s]  I know who this is now.
[3560.49s -> 3561.69s]  Joshua of Rossfield.
[3562.65s -> 3565.05s]  Second son of the Archduke of Rosaria,
[3565.05s -> 3568.89s]  Joshua was appointed heir to the Ducal throne by virtue of his awakening
[3568.89s -> 3571.29s]  as the dominant of the phoenix.
[3571.29s -> 3574.49s]  His love, actually, that's actually really cool.
[3575.29s -> 3576.17s]  Let's go back to it now.
[3577.21s -> 3578.09s]  Hold on a second.
[3578.09s -> 3580.86s]  Pause it one more time.
[3580.86s -> 3588.58s]  Don't let me be in charge of pausing anything.
[3588.58s -> 3591.62s]  I'm imagining, and I know I'm just kind of messing around here,
[3591.62s -> 3594.68s]  but I'm imagining if you hear somebody say something
[3595.24s -> 3598.44s]  or talk about something, you could just pause it and be like, wait.
[3598.44s -> 3600.28s]  They said Rosalith Castle was out, right?
[3600.28s -> 3601.00s]  Okay, that's this one.
[3602.18s -> 3602.74s]  That's cool.
[3603.30s -> 3608.58s]  That's cool.
[3608.58s -> 3609.38s]  I like that.
[3609.38s -> 3610.66s]  We have an early start.
[3610.66s -> 3612.26s]  I'm going to sleep.
[3612.90s -> 3624.06s]  Go back and read the queen's profile.
[3624.06s -> 3628.36s]  Wait.
[3628.36s -> 3631.32s]  Oh, it's whatever is currently in the frame.
[3631.32s -> 3632.12s]  Is that how it works?
[3632.68s -> 3635.51s]  I suppose, let me see.
[3636.07s -> 3637.90s]  I think that's how it works.
[3638.46s -> 3640.25s]  This is it then.
[3640.25s -> 3644.28s]  Prove yourself.
[3644.28s -> 3645.48s]  Wishing on a star.
[3645.48s -> 3647.45s]  I'll talk about a couple things after this too,
[3647.45s -> 3648.65s]  because somebody brought this up,
[3648.65s -> 3651.13s]  but I want to make sure I tell people this
[3651.13s -> 3654.57s]  because I feel like people that know this would go, oh, okay.
[3654.57s -> 3655.07s]  Right.
[3660.31s -> 3661.11s]  Yeah, that's cool.
[3661.11s -> 3664.17s]  All right, so you're born a princess of the Northern Territories.
[3664.17s -> 3668.41s]  Jill was made a ward of Rosaria after her homeland's incessant raids
[3668.41s -> 3671.99s]  were quelled by the Duchy.
[3673.56s -> 3678.28s]  She was raised in Rosalith Castle alongside Clive and Joshua
[3678.28s -> 3686.15s]  who came to love her as a sister.
[3686.15s -> 3687.27s]  That's so helpful for me.
[3687.91s -> 3695.70s]  You're going with them tomorrow, aren't you?
[3695.70s -> 3700.81s]  I am Joshua's shield.
[3700.81s -> 3705.66s]  I'm sworn to protect him.
[3705.66s -> 3707.18s]  He takes too many risks.
[3707.18s -> 3708.30s]  Jerma mode.
[3708.30s -> 3710.38s]  I only wish I could save him from himself.
[3710.38s -> 3711.82s]  You mean a good mode.
[3712.39s -> 3716.66s]  Clive, you...
[3716.66s -> 3717.86s]  I have another mission too.
[3719.21s -> 3721.13s]  Father has given me my first command.
[3724.33s -> 3724.89s]  Well...
[3724.89s -> 3725.61s]  What does command mean?
[3725.61s -> 3728.09s]  If you're not going to pray to Meteor for your safety...
[3728.09s -> 3729.21s]  He said a word I don't understand.
[3729.21s -> 3729.69s]  Command?
[3730.42s -> 3733.32s]  It's not here.
[3733.32s -> 3734.04s]  Command?
[3734.04s -> 3734.84s]  What's that mean?
[3734.84s -> 3737.21s]  I shall just have to do it for you.
[3755.64s -> 3757.88s]  Dude's gonna pull this off every cutscene now.
[3757.88s -> 3759.16s]  I promise I'm not gonna.
[3759.16s -> 3761.48s]  There's going to be another war, isn't there?
[3765.96s -> 3768.92s]  Since coming here, I've begun to take peace for granted.
[3770.44s -> 3772.92s]  I assume the war between our nations would be the last.
[3773.48s -> 3779.00s]  But it never really ends, does it?
[3783.61s -> 3784.17s]  No.
[3784.17s -> 3791.82s]  The next war will be bigger than before.
[3793.99s -> 3795.75s]  But you'll be all right, won't you, Clive?
[3796.39s -> 3798.39s]  You're a shield of Rosaria, after all.
[3798.39s -> 3799.67s]  I'm blessed by the phoenix.
[3801.11s -> 3817.69s]  It's getting cold.
[3818.41s -> 3819.80s]  We should go in.
[3820.60s -> 3822.17s]  Bye, lady.
[3827.40s -> 3828.28s]  Good night, Clive.
[3828.92s -> 3831.67s]  And you press the lower button to find out why it's cold.
[3832.31s -> 3833.64s]  It just...
[3833.64s -> 3834.20s]  All right, you press...
[3834.20s -> 3834.84s]  You go like this.
[3835.48s -> 3838.89s]  And it has like the forecast in the top right.
[3838.89s -> 3839.69s]  It's chilly.
[3839.69s -> 3841.53s]  65 degrees at Rosalith Castle.
[3843.14s -> 3847.37s]  Northwest winds blowing at 15 miles per hour.
[3847.37s -> 3847.93s]  That'd be cool.
[3848.57s -> 3861.99s]  You broke your promise already?
[3861.99s -> 3863.11s]  Well, that was the end of the cutscene.
[3865.22s -> 3866.02s]  Also, do I have a second?
[3866.02s -> 3866.52s]  Let's see.
[3867.46s -> 3869.38s]  People were saying Devil May Cry.
[3870.10s -> 3871.94s]  So the combat director of this game,
[3873.22s -> 3875.22s]  Ryota Suzuki?
[3875.22s -> 3878.58s]  Ryota Suzuki worked on Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma.
[3879.22s -> 3882.70s]  So that's the combat director of the game.
[3891.37s -> 3903.67s]  Also, the director and producer of Final Fantasy XIV.
[3904.31s -> 3907.91s]  And the composer and sound director of Final Fantasy XIV also worked on this.
[3916.90s -> 3921.22s]  If that is perking your ears up a little, if you liked those games,
[3921.78s -> 3922.26s]  I don't know.
[3922.26s -> 3922.58s]  We'll see.
[3937.85s -> 3938.73s]  Yeah, that's Yoshido.
[3939.69s -> 3946.70s]  And Masayoshi Soken, composer of the game.
[3962.62s -> 3964.46s]  The combat director is interesting, though.
[3966.84s -> 3972.62s]  I'm very curious how it actually plays out fighting and battle scenarios.
[3976.36s -> 3979.16s]  It's actually a dream team to make a Final Fantasy game.
[3981.45s -> 3982.17s]  It sounds like it.
[3992.34s -> 3996.17s]  The Beastmen are a fierce foe.
[3996.89s -> 3998.73s]  We underestimate them at our peril.
[3998.73s -> 3999.45s]  We need some lore?
[4000.49s -> 4002.09s]  Not today, we won't.
[4002.09s -> 4003.21s]  Wait, we need to know who these people are.
[4004.01s -> 4015.51s]  One of the stables of Rosalith Castle,
[4015.51s -> 4020.71s]  Rosio was chosen by the young Clive Rosfield to be his personal steed and raised by him from a chick.
[4021.35s -> 4024.55s]  She's a proud bird and deeply loyal to her master,
[4024.55s -> 4032.23s]  quickly turning her beak upon any but he who should attempt to pet her.
[4032.23s -> 4036.54s]  So wait, Sir Tyler, let us do our duty.
[4036.54s -> 4039.66s]  They don't have lore because somebody said,
[4039.66s -> 4042.14s]  I don't think they have lore because they're probably dead soon.
[4042.14s -> 4043.02s]  To the marshes then.
[4043.02s -> 4043.98s]  Well, you don't know that.
[4044.78s -> 4046.46s]  That's not why they don't have a lore card.
[4047.18s -> 4057.19s]  Blessing of the crystals go with us.
[4057.19s -> 4058.39s]  Over world map.
[4058.39s -> 4065.82s]  The world map displays all the locations indicated by glowing pins currently available
[4065.82s -> 4067.50s]  to Clive via fast travel.
[4068.14s -> 4072.22s]  OK, so we're going here.
[4072.22s -> 4073.26s]  So this is still wind.
[4075.54s -> 4076.66s]  Make for still wind.
[4076.66s -> 4092.71s]  Those guys weren't as important as a bird.
[4093.27s -> 4095.13s]  I think that bird's probably really important.
[4106.18s -> 4107.54s]  No, I'm not going to lore check.
[4107.54s -> 4109.30s]  These guys don't have a lore card.
[4110.31s -> 4110.71s]  Watch.
[4113.32s -> 4115.53s]  Whoa, shit.
[4115.53s -> 4116.09s]  Sir Wade.
[4116.81s -> 4120.73s]  A loyal shield of Rosaria chosen by Lord Commander Rodney Murdock
[4120.73s -> 4124.02s]  to accompany Clive on his expedition to still wind.
[4124.02s -> 4130.82s]  Once, but a lowborn page, Wade was inspired to join the ranks after a woodpile fell on him
[4130.82s -> 4134.15s]  and his life was saved by a young Joshua.
[4134.15s -> 4134.79s]  OK, cool.
[4134.79s -> 4135.99s]  What about you?
[4136.63s -> 4140.34s]  A little bit more for Tyler here.
[4140.34s -> 4145.14s]  A loyal shield of Rosaria and Sion of a noble family.
[4145.14s -> 4149.56s]  Tyler followed in his father's footsteps in entering the service of the duchy,
[4149.56s -> 4154.17s]  rising to the position of right-hand man to the Lord Commander.
[4154.17s -> 4158.01s]  He was chosen by Lord Murdock to accompany Clive on his expedition to still wind.
[4158.01s -> 4164.31s]  A level head who could be trusted not only to obey the young lord's orders and keep him safe,
[4164.31s -> 4169.10s]  but to help keep the fiery sir Wade in line.
[4169.10s -> 4169.90s]  Goblins.
[4169.90s -> 4173.61s]  We don't know anything, but I don't want to see that yet.
[4173.61s -> 4175.29s]  Keep your eyes open for those goblins.
[4175.29s -> 4177.56s]  Ports placed them in this area.
[4177.56s -> 4179.72s]  It's all swamps from here.
[4180.28s -> 4181.80s]  Watch your step, my lord.
[4181.80s -> 4184.20s]  And everything else.
[4185.85s -> 4191.67s]  OK, lost in a fog.
[4196.22s -> 4197.58s]  Feeling overwhelmed?
[4197.58s -> 4202.36s]  Try equipping one or more of the five timely accessories.
[4202.36s -> 4207.16s]  For example, the ring of timely strikes allows its wearer to chain complex attack combos
[4207.88s -> 4209.40s]  only using square.
[4209.40s -> 4213.48s]  The ring of timely focus slows time before an incoming attack.
[4214.82s -> 4218.10s]  As with all items, timely accessories can be equipped or not equipped on the gear tab.
[4218.10s -> 4220.12s]  Oh, I think I'm all right.
[4220.12s -> 4221.69s]  We'll be fine.
[4222.57s -> 4229.48s]  I said to check.
[4230.04s -> 4236.38s]  Not exactly the most well-maintained path.
[4237.02s -> 4238.94s]  But who do you imagine would maintain it?
[4239.66s -> 4240.70s]  Oh no, I lost my touch.
[4240.70s -> 4242.14s]  All fled from the blight.
[4242.14s -> 4243.02s]  No more skipping.
[4249.02s -> 4253.27s]  The music is preparing me for something.
[4253.27s -> 4253.75s]  I like this.
[4253.75s -> 4265.48s]  The old village of still wind is ahead.
[4266.20s -> 4268.89s]  Not that there's a lot left of it.
[4268.89s -> 4270.84s]  Get the item.
[4271.56s -> 4273.61s]  Two gil.
[4274.33s -> 4276.02s]  Two bucks.
[4278.87s -> 4280.23s]  Wait, I gotta check over here.
[4280.87s -> 4288.58s]  I didn't try to jump over that.
[4288.58s -> 4290.74s]  I was trying to touch the butterflies that are above it.
[4310.31s -> 4311.11s]  What are they doing?
[4318.30s -> 4320.46s]  Oh, you fucked up so bad.
[4321.34s -> 4325.86s]  How could you have stepped on one of the sticks?
[4334.07s -> 4338.17s]  Oh, first time, first combat.
[4338.17s -> 4341.34s]  OK.
[4348.26s -> 4350.74s]  Oh, shit.
[4350.74s -> 4351.30s]  All right, cool.
[4362.38s -> 4363.98s]  So the reports were true.
[4363.98s -> 4365.02s]  We should press on.
[4365.58s -> 4366.70s]  There may be more ahead.
[4368.81s -> 4369.37s]  Floor check.
[4373.46s -> 4374.58s]  All right, we have pictures now.
[4375.14s -> 4383.53s]  Did I miss any items or anything?
[4383.53s -> 4384.09s]  I don't think so.
[4396.36s -> 4397.24s]  I see a shiny.
[4397.80s -> 4402.04s]  Can I get in here?
[4402.04s -> 4406.14s]  Yep.
[4406.14s -> 4407.02s]  Strength tonic.
[4411.26s -> 4412.78s]  Keep slaying those goblins.
[4414.41s -> 4417.96s]  All right.
[4417.96s -> 4420.01s]  Welcome to still wind.
[4420.01s -> 4425.40s]  Have care, my lord.
[4425.40s -> 4426.52s]  Oh, more goblins.
[4437.90s -> 4440.38s]  Some enemies will drop gil or items upon the defeat.
[4440.38s -> 4441.82s]  Loot is gathered automatically.
[4441.82s -> 4466.87s]  OK, gold loot on the ground.
[4466.87s -> 4469.75s]  I do appreciate the small denomination of currency,
[4470.39s -> 4474.38s]  but I don't want 10,000 gil in my pocket.
[4474.38s -> 4475.26s]  I'd want like 10.
[4478.12s -> 4479.99s]  Can't break it.
[4479.99s -> 4490.30s]  Oh, ocean.
[4490.30s -> 4491.18s]  Should I heal now?
[4491.90s -> 4502.47s]  Strength tonic.
[4502.47s -> 4503.43s]  I should probably put these on the bar.
[4504.23s -> 4509.35s]  Yeah, the music is wonderful.
[4512.84s -> 4517.64s]  This should be a master class on how to do background music that feels engaging.
[4520.25s -> 4521.93s]  But it's not it's not so much.
[4521.93s -> 4522.73s]  It's not offensive.
[4546.20s -> 4547.72s]  Oh, they are spell slingers.
[4547.72s -> 4548.68s]  New enemies approach.
[4549.40s -> 4566.01s]  OK, I'm going to.
[4566.65s -> 4571.14s]  OK, I was going to say I can just do that whenever I want.
[4586.47s -> 4588.70s]  If only you could speak goblin.
[4589.50s -> 4595.26s]  Wait, lore check the spell slinger.
[4595.26s -> 4598.86s]  There's not going to be individual lore cards for every enemy type.
[4599.74s -> 4606.04s]  Can I do anything else with the fire?
[4606.04s -> 4611.56s]  I wonder there actually might be maybe.
[4623.69s -> 4627.61s]  Haven't pressing R2 like that is definitely feels different for me.
[4628.25s -> 4632.14s]  This is the next generation of controllers in my hand.
[4641.48s -> 4647.40s]  I've barely experienced that and this is a PlayStation thing.
[4647.40s -> 4650.20s]  This is a I have to I have to squeeze it.
[4650.20s -> 4651.96s]  You have to squeeze that shit.
[4651.96s -> 4653.24s]  You have to squeeze it.
[4653.24s -> 4655.96s]  We should be nearing the old village square.
[4657.00s -> 4659.08s]  It might not be a nest of goblins.
[4660.04s -> 4667.69s]  Oh, he's the ad guy.
[4667.69s -> 4670.09s]  No, I've I have never experienced this before.
[4670.97s -> 4674.97s]  I've never pressed the right trigger before and had to like squeeze it a little.
[4674.97s -> 4675.77s]  I just tell it.
[4675.77s -> 4678.49s]  This is my first experience playing with a piece station five.
[4695.75s -> 4696.63s]  We're trapped.
[4697.19s -> 4700.07s]  My lord, I'm working on it.
[4700.87s -> 4702.79s]  Well, bring it on.
[4702.79s -> 4703.29s]  Let's go.
[4705.91s -> 4713.58s]  He's the leader to take care of his followers first.
[4714.54s -> 4718.81s]  Oh, can't have been the hurt.
[4719.85s -> 4720.33s]  Let's go.
[4720.33s -> 4721.21s]  You have to ask.
[4722.65s -> 4748.49s]  What do you got?
[4748.49s -> 4748.81s]  What do you got?
[4748.81s -> 4749.13s]  What do you got?
[4749.13s -> 4749.53s]  What do you got?
[4755.56s -> 4756.44s]  Coming.
[4756.44s -> 4768.71s]  There was one.
[4768.71s -> 4769.51s]  Holy shit.
[4769.51s -> 4774.20s]  OK, let's do it.
[4775.88s -> 4782.20s]  So wait on three larger enemies must be faced with caution.
[4782.20s -> 4785.24s]  If farmer HP than their smaller counterparts will often use devastating
[4785.24s -> 4787.24s]  abilities to overwhelm opponents.
[4787.32s -> 4790.60s]  Use the blessing of the phoenix to not only deal considerable damage
[4790.60s -> 4793.08s]  to these enemies, but also break their wills.
[4794.50s -> 4797.54s]  Breaking an enemy's will can stagger it, leaving it unable to act invulnerable.
[4797.54s -> 4798.18s]  Let's go.
[4810.52s -> 4820.70s]  This is fun.
[4820.70s -> 4821.02s]  All right.
[4821.02s -> 4823.82s]  Enemies will become partially staggered when their will gauge is reduced to 50%.
[4825.74s -> 4827.26s]  I don't want to check the lore right now.
[4827.90s -> 4829.18s]  Creating a short opening.
[4829.98s -> 4833.66s]  Hold on.
[4833.66s -> 4834.70s]  Let me look at the lore book.
[4837.53s -> 4838.09s]  I know.
[4839.56s -> 4841.24s]  I can't look at the lore book right now.
[4841.96s -> 4857.86s]  Oh, shit.
[4857.86s -> 4859.78s]  OK, I got to time it better than that field.
[4860.58s -> 4865.38s]  All right, let's go.
[4866.92s -> 4867.80s]  Co-op, let's do it.
[4868.36s -> 4872.42s]  Completely reducing an enemy's will gauge will stagger it.
[4873.80s -> 4876.12s]  Extra damage is dealt when an enemy is fully staggered,
[4876.12s -> 4878.92s]  increasing with each strike landed up to a maximum of 150%.
[4879.64s -> 4882.84s]  The total amount of damage dealt during this time is displayed
[4882.84s -> 4884.76s]  upon the enemy regaining its senses.
[4885.40s -> 4885.88s]  That's cool.
[4887.00s -> 4887.24s]  OK.
[4888.12s -> 4891.10s]  So it just counts it all up.
[4891.82s -> 4892.95s]  All right, let's start counting.
[4914.04s -> 4916.12s]  Oh, quadruple dodge.
[4919.78s -> 4920.34s]  Dude.
[4920.34s -> 4921.06s]  All right.
[4921.06s -> 4922.10s]  You got any more?
[4922.10s -> 4923.06s]  You got any more in there?
[4924.26s -> 4948.20s]  All right, let's end it.
[4962.34s -> 4962.58s]  Go.
[4963.38s -> 4963.86s]  Who is it?
[4964.66s -> 4967.02s]  Giga Chad.
[4970.34s -> 4971.22s]  Level up.
[4971.22s -> 4974.01s]  Do I have to put any points in or anything?
[4977.03s -> 4977.91s]  Hard leather.
[4981.32s -> 4983.32s]  Following important battles, a separate results screen
[4983.32s -> 4985.96s]  will appear displaying battle performance and rewards.
[4986.04s -> 4989.21s]  Rewards are based on performance and may include items, gear,
[4989.21s -> 4994.87s]  ability points, and experience points.
[4994.87s -> 4995.19s]  OK.
[4996.15s -> 4996.79s]  There's gear.
[4998.39s -> 5010.50s]  I'm going to get stopped this dude.
[5010.50s -> 5013.74s]  Come back and fight, you coward.
[5013.74s -> 5014.62s]  After him.
[5014.62s -> 5015.82s]  Before he summons the rest.
[5016.54s -> 5017.34s]  But I-
[5017.34s -> 5018.38s]  Hold on, let me get an item first.
[5022.30s -> 5022.62s]  OK.
[5023.50s -> 5024.62s]  So I got to go to the gear tab.
[5029.35s -> 5032.07s]  Learning new ones require ability points.
[5032.07s -> 5038.94s]  OK, here we are.
[5038.94s -> 5041.51s]  The attributes tab provides a comprehensive overview
[5041.51s -> 5044.63s]  of Clive's current level status, abilities, and gear.
[5045.43s -> 5047.56s]  All right, what does the gear look like?
[5051.26s -> 5054.14s]  The gear and icons tab is used for equipping weapons and armor
[5054.14s -> 5055.90s]  as well as assigning iconic abilities.
[5056.70s -> 5060.52s]  All right, so this is 10 defense.
[5061.69s -> 5062.65s]  Oh, I like that.
[5063.61s -> 5064.01s]  Like that.
[5065.08s -> 5065.32s]  OK.
[5065.96s -> 5066.76s]  Do I need new belts?
[5069.82s -> 5071.90s]  No, I don't need to put on them.
[5071.90s -> 5072.70s]  Put any of those on.
[5074.60s -> 5075.16s]  Abilities.
[5076.44s -> 5078.20s]  Ability points can be spent in the abilities tab
[5078.20s -> 5081.64s]  to acquire new abilities as well as upgrade existing ones.
[5081.64s -> 5084.84s]  If you are unsatisfied with Clive's current build,
[5085.48s -> 5087.80s]  reset all abilities and try again.
[5087.80s -> 5089.48s]  There's no penalty for doing so.
[5090.12s -> 5093.83s]  OK, this indicates an ability's capacity for dealing damage
[5093.83s -> 5095.11s]  and for breaking a target's will.
[5100.18s -> 5103.70s]  Melee attack, skill points too.
[5106.34s -> 5107.62s]  OK, this is-
[5107.62s -> 5108.42s]  This is going to be-
[5109.14s -> 5111.37s]  All right, I'm excited.
[5112.18s -> 5113.22s]  All right, so should I-
[5113.22s -> 5113.94s]  What should I upgrade?
[5116.15s -> 5116.87s]  Can I upgrade this?
[5117.51s -> 5118.55s]  Just the melee ability?
[5119.19s -> 5122.55s]  I have 152 ability points.
[5125.56s -> 5126.52s]  Do magic instead?
[5127.16s -> 5128.70s]  Magic burst?
[5129.34s -> 5133.18s]  Oh, you can do that in between every single swing.
[5133.18s -> 5144.74s]  Charred magic?
[5144.74s -> 5146.10s]  Hold to increase potency.
[5147.91s -> 5148.31s]  Stomp?
[5151.03s -> 5152.15s]  Upgrade skipping.
[5153.94s -> 5156.73s]  Phoenix shift, which makes that-
[5156.73s -> 5157.29s]  I don't have enough.
[5159.45s -> 5160.81s]  Let's go with one of these.
[5160.81s -> 5162.17s]  OK, swift recovery.
[5162.73s -> 5163.91s]  That's probably pretty good.
[5165.83s -> 5166.15s]  Taunt?
[5169.78s -> 5170.58s]  Burning blade?
[5172.52s -> 5173.40s]  Yeah, I want that.
[5176.94s -> 5177.98s]  I want this even stronger.
[5177.98s -> 5178.54s]  Do I have enough?
[5183.27s -> 5183.99s]  Down thrust?
[5185.48s -> 5185.88s]  Lunge?
[5186.44s -> 5187.08s]  I like that too.
[5187.64s -> 5189.67s]  All right, I'm going to do lunge.
[5191.06s -> 5193.61s]  And burning blade.
[5194.25s -> 5195.70s]  So this is hold square,
[5195.70s -> 5198.58s]  and this one is square and X at the same time.
[5202.63s -> 5204.15s]  All right, I don't want to spend too money though.
[5204.15s -> 5208.14s]  This is holding triangle, OK?
[5208.14s -> 5209.10s]  I want to save my points.
[5210.98s -> 5211.38s]  All right, let's go.
[5211.38s -> 5211.86s]  So let me see.
[5214.46s -> 5214.78s]  Nice.
[5215.34s -> 5216.54s]  And then lunge.
[5217.34s -> 5220.14s]  And then if I hold, I can get a fire sword.
[5221.37s -> 5225.54s]  And then saving in the demo.
[5227.06s -> 5228.58s]  All of your progress carries over, by the way.
[5229.22s -> 5233.98s]  Whatever you do in the demo,
[5234.54s -> 5235.74s]  carries over to the real game.
[5236.38s -> 5240.15s]  Stomp is going to be essential with how cheap it is, probably.
[5240.79s -> 5243.94s]  Well, we'll see.
[5249.66s -> 5250.94s]  Come on, I could have hit him.
[5250.94s -> 5251.74s]  I could have hit him.
[5252.46s -> 5256.41s]  Please.
[5257.13s -> 5262.81s]  It didn't really cause a problem.
[5263.61s -> 5281.03s]  Is this the precursor to the real big scary boss, I wonder?
[5281.67s -> 5288.02s]  Uh-oh, yeah.
[5288.98s -> 5290.10s]  It's never going to be that easy.
[5303.30s -> 5304.90s]  Oh my goodness gracious, OK.
[5304.90s -> 5310.25s]  I'm awful.
[5311.59s -> 5312.15s]  Quick climb.
[5312.15s -> 5312.63s]  Look at the box.
[5318.07s -> 5328.02s]  I'm standing that.
[5351.59s -> 5352.47s]  Oh, I missed the lunge.
[5352.47s -> 5352.79s]  Sorry.
[5362.62s -> 5364.38s]  Chip damage, chip damage, chip damage.
[5365.10s -> 5381.64s]  Swing, swing, swing, swing.
[5381.64s -> 5390.60s]  You're good.
[5390.60s -> 5391.64s]  This is as good as mine.
[5395.32s -> 5395.96s]  Oh, shit.
[5404.84s -> 5405.72s]  Oh, no.
[5405.72s -> 5405.96s]  All right.
[5405.96s -> 5408.12s]  There's a cinematic strike mode.
[5408.12s -> 5412.09s]  When the screen flashes blue like this during a pivotal moment in battle,
[5412.89s -> 5414.89s]  a square before time runs out.
[5414.89s -> 5415.21s]  All right.
[5415.21s -> 5416.49s]  There's a QTE.
[5416.49s -> 5418.01s]  There's a cinematic QTE.
[5418.97s -> 5419.37s]  Let's go.
[5423.51s -> 5424.07s]  1,100.
[5424.07s -> 5424.71s]  That's pretty good.
[5425.27s -> 5428.31s]  I wonder if there's a cinematic upgrade tree.
[5429.03s -> 5430.82s]  Before it recovers.
[5442.01s -> 5442.73s]  And one more.
[5461.21s -> 5464.09s]  Oh, there's a parry in the game, too.
[5464.09s -> 5466.41s]  Oh, I'm fucking playing this for sure.
[5467.59s -> 5471.43s]  Use square just as a permanent attack, but it temporarily slows time and shit.
[5471.43s -> 5471.59s]  All right.
[5471.59s -> 5472.23s]  What do I do?
[5472.23s -> 5472.63s]  Press.
[5472.63s -> 5473.19s]  What is it?
[5473.19s -> 5473.59s]  Square.
[5474.55s -> 5477.88s]  There's a parry in the game.
[5477.88s -> 5478.92s]  You've got me now.
[5478.92s -> 5479.56s]  You've got me.
[5479.56s -> 5480.04s]  I'm here.
[5483.51s -> 5485.51s]  So it's right when it...
[5485.51s -> 5485.91s]  Wait, I...
[5485.91s -> 5486.55s]  Oh, I did it.
[5487.35s -> 5490.14s]  Let me try it again.
[5490.70s -> 5502.73s]  Oh, shit.
[5502.73s -> 5503.37s]  Sorry.
[5503.37s -> 5512.49s]  Oh, did it work?
[5513.05s -> 5513.77s]  Oh, no.
[5513.77s -> 5514.17s]  Hold on.
[5514.17s -> 5514.97s]  I'll get it.
[5514.97s -> 5516.57s]  It's a square right when you're about to get hit.
[5517.29s -> 5521.35s]  I'm just going to practice it.
[5521.99s -> 5523.58s]  Ow.
[5524.14s -> 5529.30s]  Am I doing it wrong?
[5529.86s -> 5530.66s]  I think I'm doing it wrong.
[5531.46s -> 5532.87s]  Square.
[5533.43s -> 5557.45s]  Stick to dodge roll.
[5566.20s -> 5566.76s]  Something else.
[5566.76s -> 5567.96s]  Cinematic evasion.
[5568.60s -> 5570.10s]  Okay.
[5578.58s -> 5581.59s]  I'm a caster.
[5581.59s -> 5582.31s]  I'm going to stay back here.
[5582.87s -> 5597.94s]  Oh, I'm good.
[5597.94s -> 5609.26s]  Oh, wow.
[5613.22s -> 5613.62s]  True.
[5614.58s -> 5626.39s]  I kind of like these two guys, too.
[5626.39s -> 5629.83s]  I didn't care at all until 10 seconds ago about these two.
[5630.39s -> 5651.86s]  That should be it.
[5651.86s -> 5662.28s]  I got to do the thrust more often.
[5674.94s -> 5698.10s]  Whoops.
[5698.10s -> 5698.98s]  Don't do it.
[5698.98s -> 5701.48s]  I don't have any heals left.
[5701.48s -> 5702.20s]  I got to be careful.
[5702.20s -> 5702.68s]  I don't want to...
[5702.68s -> 5703.16s]  Oh, fuck.
[5703.16s -> 5704.20s]  I'm going to die right now.
[5712.81s -> 5721.30s]  All right.
[5721.30s -> 5722.74s]  Time to play like a coward.
[5724.66s -> 5725.54s]  Are those guys okay?
[5726.58s -> 5728.76s]  Here we go.
[5728.76s -> 5729.32s]  I'm going to dodge it.
[5730.04s -> 5738.81s]  There it is.
[5738.81s -> 5739.13s]  Get him!
[5741.75s -> 5746.25s]  Almost through there.
[5746.25s -> 5747.05s]  That's true.
[5747.05s -> 5757.22s]  Almost died to the tutorial boss.
[5757.22s -> 5759.61s]  Well, the tutorial boss is there for you to learn.
[5759.77s -> 5761.21s]  How the game functions.
[5761.21s -> 5763.58s]  I think I did a pretty good job.
[5773.67s -> 5780.02s]  Oh, my lord.
[5780.02s -> 5781.10s]  Thanks.
[5783.94s -> 5785.14s]  Never thought I'd see it.
[5786.44s -> 5790.12s]  Not just goblins in Rosaria, but more balls, too.
[5790.92s -> 5793.08s]  I'll petition his grace to send a detachment.
[5796.47s -> 5799.27s]  If we don't stop them here, they'll be at our gates before long.
[5803.37s -> 5804.25s]  We should get moving.
[5804.89s -> 5807.21s]  We don't want to be caught out here after dark.
[5807.21s -> 5810.57s]  If we set off now, we can still reach Phoenix Gate before nightfall.
[5820.92s -> 5823.72s]  Third boss lands.
[5823.72s -> 5831.19s]  Is it still alive?
[5831.19s -> 5831.59s]  It might be.
[5849.02s -> 5852.62s]  This is the Phoenix Gate.
[5860.17s -> 5869.61s]  Check it out.
[5869.61s -> 5870.97s]  Some time later.
[5901.98s -> 5907.27s]  The lord check.
[5908.71s -> 5913.72s]  Oh, imagine there was like 40 circles.
[5913.72s -> 5917.59s]  Is there updated info, though?
[5917.59s -> 5924.02s]  There's a little indicator on here.
[5924.02s -> 5925.88s]  Oh, maybe it means he just showed up.
[5925.88s -> 5926.36s]  Okay.
[5926.36s -> 5931.74s]  The young lord has a bright future ahead of him.
[5931.74s -> 5935.69s]  In one of these nights, he may even deign to join us.
[5943.29s -> 5946.97s]  It does have updated info.
[5947.53s -> 5951.85s]  I really do appreciate that, though,
[5951.85s -> 5954.41s]  because I have said many, many times how I just kind of...
[5955.05s -> 5957.66s]  Sometimes I just need to open up like a thing
[5957.66s -> 5959.90s]  and give me like two sentences of who the fuck these people are.
[5974.55s -> 5975.67s]  Makes it easy to jump back in.
[5977.99s -> 5979.67s]  Potentially days or weeks later, too.
[6015.29s -> 6018.17s]  We cannot live without the blessing of the crystals.
[6019.06s -> 6021.30s]  And the crystals work their magic through us.
[6023.94s -> 6024.82s]  Eat that bread so badly.
[6024.82s -> 6026.90s]  You have been blessed, Joshua.
[6027.64s -> 6029.48s]  Blessed to be a dominant.
[6029.48s -> 6031.56s]  To wield the power of an icon.
[6032.82s -> 6035.94s]  Our family has been chosen to share that power with the people.
[6038.81s -> 6040.17s]  So that is what we must do.
[6059.59s -> 6063.11s]  Brunk.
[6064.07s -> 6066.07s]  Singing, eating a shitload of bread.
[6067.27s -> 6071.56s]  That sounds like a great time, doesn't it?
[6071.56s -> 6072.52s]  That sounds great.
[6083.30s -> 6084.98s]  A room full of carbs, yeah.
[6084.98s -> 6099.59s]  It's an off-brand meeting.
[6107.50s -> 6108.78s]  I don't think we would get very much done.
[6131.00s -> 6131.80s]  Lore check the dog.
[6138.36s -> 6141.16s]  Torgal, Clive's faithful friend,
[6141.16s -> 6145.56s]  brought back from one of Archduke Elwynn's expeditions to the frozen Northern Territories,
[6146.12s -> 6149.32s]  where he was found half-starved and shivering in a snowfield,
[6149.32s -> 6151.96s]  having presumably been separated from his pack.
[6151.96s -> 6154.87s]  Elwynn gifted the puppy to Clive upon his return,
[6154.87s -> 6157.27s]  and the two became nigh inseparable.
[6161.91s -> 6162.95s]  What are you doing out here?
[6163.51s -> 6165.16s]  I didn't see you at the feast.
[6166.54s -> 6169.74s]  Feasts are the only time shields are allowed to take their ease,
[6169.74s -> 6174.02s]  and I've never really been one for cakes and ale.
[6174.58s -> 6176.68s]  It's the vegetables I don't like.
[6181.10s -> 6187.43s]  That was cool.
[6194.71s -> 6196.15s]  I hear you slew a mawble.
[6196.87s -> 6200.63s]  All the men were singing your praises.
[6200.63s -> 6202.70s]  They never used to.
[6203.50s -> 6207.98s]  When I joined the ranks, everyone thought I was a spoiled little lordling.
[6209.48s -> 6212.20s]  If I didn't know how to handle a sword, I'd be a laughingstock.
[6213.24s -> 6215.40s]  The Archduke's first-born failure.
[6215.96s -> 6218.15s]  Why have I-
[6218.15s -> 6219.75s]  You're the one they really believe in.
[6219.75s -> 6221.83s]  Why have I heard this voice actor before?
[6221.83s -> 6222.33s]  I'm jealous.
[6224.42s -> 6225.38s]  That's not true.
[6226.42s -> 6228.18s]  They don't believe in me.
[6228.18s -> 6230.02s]  They believe in the power of the Dominant.
[6230.58s -> 6233.32s]  I heard this.
[6234.28s -> 6238.12s]  My brother the phoenix, ruler of a life and death.
[6238.76s -> 6240.33s]  It isn't fair.
[6241.05s -> 6242.09s]  It should have been you.
[6244.30s -> 6246.62s]  I don't have what it takes to lead our people.
[6247.50s -> 6250.70s]  I don't have the strength, but you do.
[6251.50s -> 6252.76s]  Let me see, hold on.
[6259.05s -> 6260.41s]  Every man has his duty.
[6261.05s -> 6264.46s]  Ours was decided long ago,
[6265.10s -> 6269.18s]  when our ancestors chose to instate the Dominant as the Archduke of Rosaria.
[6270.14s -> 6271.32s]  Hold on, I'll find a-
[6271.32s -> 6275.08s]  You need to ensure that whenever our nation stood on a precipice,
[6275.80s -> 6279.88s]  the phoenix would rise from the flames to drag us back from the brink.
[6280.44s -> 6285.24s]  The fate of Rosaria sits on the Dominant shoulders.
[6285.80s -> 6289.80s]  It is your duty to bear that burden.
[6290.52s -> 6291.24s]  Holy shit.
[6291.24s -> 6292.04s]  What about you?
[6292.04s -> 6293.56s]  This guy's done so much work.
[6294.44s -> 6297.86s]  This is like an unbelievable catalog of work.
[6297.86s -> 6300.57s]  That is why I was given the phoenix's blessing.
[6301.64s -> 6303.48s]  To keep our future rulers safe.
[6304.68s -> 6305.48s]  No matter what.
[6307.88s -> 6308.76s]  Wait, I got the wrong person.
[6308.76s -> 6313.85s]  However hard it gets.
[6313.85s -> 6315.13s]  Thank you, Tive.
[6315.13s -> 6316.81s]  I know you'll always take care of me.
[6319.74s -> 6320.94s]  I think I- do I have the wrong person?
[6322.30s -> 6325.54s]  Where I can do that, you need to take care of yourself.
[6325.54s -> 6326.34s]  No, no, no, I do.
[6326.34s -> 6327.46s]  I have the right person.
[6327.46s -> 6333.50s]  Right?
[6333.50s -> 6334.86s]  I should go inside.
[6334.86s -> 6336.22s]  It's past my bedtime.
[6337.58s -> 6338.46s]  Good night, Toggle.
[6339.18s -> 6344.52s]  Where have I heard this voice before?
[6353.24s -> 6353.96s]  Ben Starr.
[6353.96s -> 6355.40s]  Yeah, where have I heard this voice though?
[6355.96s -> 6356.44s]  Recently.
[6357.16s -> 6380.36s]  The trailer?
[6380.36s -> 6381.56s]  Supplies from the capital.
[6386.17s -> 6389.13s]  It's got a familiar voice or a familiar way of speaking.
[6397.67s -> 6399.83s]  You took your time sampling the wearers, were you?
[6407.37s -> 6409.53s]  Yeah, I had the first person I looked up at.
[6409.53s -> 6411.77s]  I thought it was the same person, but it wasn't.
[6415.29s -> 6415.77s]  Sounds good.
[6415.77s -> 6417.05s]  I like it.
[6420.76s -> 6439.13s]  You're missing lore pauses?
[6442.73s -> 6444.17s]  It's not going to give me lore right now.
[6445.05s -> 6446.65s]  No, no, no, it's not.
[6446.65s -> 6448.33s]  Guys, it doesn't give you spoilers.
[6448.33s -> 6450.73s]  It just tells you what you should know by that point.
[6460.47s -> 6463.43s]  You don't get to look and see what this guy does two chapters from now.
[6464.62s -> 6465.58s]  It doesn't work like that.
[6499.74s -> 6500.24s]  Uh-oh.
[6507.22s -> 6508.50s]  Oh, magical spells.
[6508.50s -> 6509.78s]  All right, get out there and just like...
[6512.73s -> 6516.71s]  Joshua has a four-hit combo with ice spells.
[6516.71s -> 6529.48s]  I only knew his name was Joshua because I did the thing.
[6529.48s -> 6530.04s]  I looked at it.
[6534.70s -> 6535.66s]  They're under attack.
[6535.66s -> 6539.50s]  I don't know who they are, but they've set light to half the castle.
[6539.50s -> 6541.34s]  I must get you to safety, Your Highness.
[6542.30s -> 6542.86s]  Very well.
[6543.98s -> 6544.62s]  I'm ready.
[6546.22s -> 6547.26s]  Follow me, Your Highness.
[6547.90s -> 6548.62s]  Wait, I actually...
[6548.62s -> 6549.02s]  It is.
[6549.02s -> 6549.90s]  It's true.
[6549.90s -> 6551.82s]  I actually am going to play as this character now.
[6551.82s -> 6553.02s]  You guys thought I was full of shit.
[6553.02s -> 6554.62s]  I'm going to have like ice moves getting out of my hands.
[6555.58s -> 6556.90s]  You thought I was full of shit?
[6558.33s -> 6558.83s]  Yeah.
[6559.69s -> 6560.19s]  Really?
[6562.81s -> 6564.97s]  I think I used all of his fucking power.
[6564.97s -> 6565.47s]  All right.
[6566.03s -> 6571.88s]  I just did 999, 999.
[6571.88s -> 6572.38s]  Damn it.
[6573.39s -> 6573.89s]  I'm ready.
[6592.44s -> 6595.88s]  So they are caster characters.
[6595.88s -> 6596.38s]  Okay.
[6596.92s -> 6601.07s]  The kid just cast fucking starlight.
[6604.11s -> 6605.15s]  Oh, starlight kid.
[6606.27s -> 6608.19s]  All right, let's do it.
[6616.24s -> 6616.74s]  Oh, yeah?
[6618.00s -> 6618.72s]  Do my duty.
[6621.76s -> 6626.16s]  Did I get in there?
[6627.44s -> 6630.11s]  This kid is strong.
[6638.48s -> 6639.20s]  Nice whiff.
[6639.20s -> 6640.48s]  I thought it was a range.
[6640.48s -> 6641.28s]  I thought it was range.
[6658.04s -> 6659.08s]  Garaga is a heal.
[6660.44s -> 6661.24s]  I think I remember that.
[6663.08s -> 6664.84s]  9999 heal.
[6665.48s -> 6670.90s]  Let's move.
[6686.17s -> 6692.72s]  All right, so I got that.
[6693.36s -> 6694.16s]  I can only do one.
[6694.16s -> 6695.36s]  I don't have a chain with it though.
[6695.36s -> 6696.88s]  Maybe I do if I don't land two.
[6706.62s -> 6707.74s]  This is bullshit.
[6709.48s -> 6720.60s]  Anything going on down here?
[6729.37s -> 6730.25s]  Is there a stealth kill?
[6738.65s -> 6740.49s]  Ha ha ha ha, idiot.
[6740.49s -> 6741.29s]  Stupid idiot.
[6758.65s -> 6759.15s]  Uh oh.
[6760.57s -> 6761.53s]  That's not good.
[6761.53s -> 6762.03s]  Tyler.
[6763.32s -> 6766.28s]  We just started to care about Tyler.
[6766.28s -> 6767.08s]  This is not good.
[6771.76s -> 6773.64s]  I can save him.
[6781.45s -> 6788.08s]  Sorry, you're going to be all right.
[6792.32s -> 6794.72s]  I'll hold them off.
[6810.25s -> 6810.75s]  Oh.
[6812.09s -> 6812.59s]  Oh.
[6812.89s -> 6814.00s]  It's you.
[6814.00s -> 6814.50s]  Why?
[6814.72s -> 6815.22s]  Joshua.
[6816.00s -> 6816.74s]  Come here.
[6820.80s -> 6821.30s]  Tyler.
[6822.01s -> 6822.51s]  You're hurt.
[6823.13s -> 6824.81s]  You'll survive.
[6825.87s -> 6827.07s]  Thanks to his highness.
[6827.07s -> 6828.35s]  It's all right, my lord.
[6828.35s -> 6830.11s]  I can only be three party members anyways.
[6830.91s -> 6832.11s]  You guys go on ahead.
[6832.67s -> 6833.47s]  Figure it out later.
[6842.12s -> 6843.56s]  Rescue the young prince.
[6843.56s -> 6845.74s]  Well done, Sir Wade.
[6845.74s -> 6848.65s]  Your debt, soldier.
[6851.95s -> 6852.83s]  Thank you.
[6852.83s -> 6853.33s]  Your grace.
[6854.03s -> 6862.24s]  How come there's never a fantasy character with a Boston accent?
[6862.24s -> 6863.92s]  That would be just wouldn't make any sense.
[6864.64s -> 6867.60s]  All right, you stay fucking here, kid.
[6867.60s -> 6868.48s]  You just chill out.
[6868.48s -> 6870.40s]  Do that cure shit on that guy.
[6870.40s -> 6871.44s]  Heal his fucking wounds.
[6872.88s -> 6873.68s]  I'll take everybody out.
[6873.68s -> 6876.80s]  We'll go out front and we'll just fuck these motherfuckers up.
[6877.52s -> 6880.76s]  Hey, can I get your car keys?
[6880.76s -> 6882.38s]  I just want to park it somewhere else
[6882.38s -> 6883.58s]  because there's like three people behind you.
[6884.22s -> 6885.04s]  Or in front of you.
[6885.84s -> 6886.96s]  I don't want you to trap anybody.
[6886.96s -> 6888.24s]  Do something, Elif.
[6888.24s -> 6891.71s]  May the winds speed you to Rosaleth.
[6892.51s -> 6906.20s]  The north gate's up ahead.
[6906.76s -> 6908.20s]  There are chocobos in the stables.
[6909.00s -> 6912.04s]  Father, take Joshua and get to safety.
[6912.04s -> 6915.13s]  No, I'm not going without you.
[6915.13s -> 6916.81s]  You're supposed to be my shield.
[6916.81s -> 6917.13s]  Remember?
[6917.13s -> 6920.97s]  It'd be great to have that 9999 heal.
[6920.97s -> 6922.49s]  I would love to take this kid.
[6922.49s -> 6925.61s]  Which is why I'm going to hold the enemy here while you make your escape.
[6926.41s -> 6928.89s]  I will order our remaining forces to rally at the gate.
[6929.53s -> 6930.17s]  Now go.
[6930.17s -> 6939.10s]  Do my duty.
[6940.04s -> 6941.32s]  You must do your duty too.
[6946.96s -> 6947.44s]  I know.
[6951.32s -> 6952.68s]  You have to keep father safe.
[6953.40s -> 6955.24s]  If I like this, would I like 15 as well?
[6956.04s -> 6964.32s]  Somebody just said you would like 15 if you like this.
[6964.32s -> 6964.64s]  Maybe.
[6965.20s -> 6970.88s]  You would like 14.
[6971.44s -> 6989.93s]  Are we going for it?
[6994.03s -> 6994.91s]  14 is pretty good.
[6998.56s -> 7000.80s]  Well, I don't have to know anything, right?
[7003.12s -> 7004.56s]  It's just its own video game.
[7005.28s -> 7007.84s]  I don't need to know everything that happened in the last 15 games
[7007.84s -> 7009.12s]  or the last 12 games or anything.
[7013.00s -> 7013.96s]  I should...
[7013.96s -> 7015.24s]  Okay, I got potions on there already.
[7020.81s -> 7021.53s]  All right, here we go.
[7027.00s -> 7027.32s]  All right.
[7028.20s -> 7035.61s]  Oh, dodge.
[7035.61s -> 7036.09s]  Wrong dodge.
[7036.89s -> 7053.44s]  Stuck on the table.
[7056.40s -> 7057.20s]  Everyone's dead.
[7057.20s -> 7058.00s]  Don't forget to parry.
[7058.80s -> 7061.23s]  I should probably learn how to parry on these guys.
[7061.95s -> 7065.34s]  I think he's trying to get away from me.
[7069.31s -> 7070.51s]  I'll try parry.
[7070.51s -> 7074.04s]  He said parry is hard.
[7074.04s -> 7074.68s]  Well, that's good.
[7075.40s -> 7080.22s]  It means insufficient inventory space.
[7080.22s -> 7081.42s]  High potion used.
[7083.79s -> 7090.44s]  Do I have to get a bigger stash or bigger inventory eventually or something?
[7108.64s -> 7114.30s]  This way you can't hold 99 potions and trivialize the game.
[7119.28s -> 7120.38s]  Here's a big fight.
[7122.56s -> 7123.12s]  Focus up.
[7133.92s -> 7134.40s]  You got it.
[7136.00s -> 7140.11s]  You try it.
[7140.11s -> 7140.43s]  Hold on.
[7141.15s -> 7142.62s]  Let's see.
[7142.62s -> 7143.02s]  Let's see.
[7145.87s -> 7146.35s]  Right when you...
[7147.07s -> 7147.31s]  No, no.
[7148.19s -> 7148.67s]  Too early.
[7149.31s -> 7154.84s]  Too early.
[7168.35s -> 7169.87s]  I was practicing, dad.
[7172.03s -> 7173.55s]  No, wait, wait.
[7173.55s -> 7174.35s]  Who is this?
[7174.35s -> 7174.91s]  Who is this?
[7175.55s -> 7176.67s]  I have the wrong character.
[7176.67s -> 7177.71s]  I need my lore book.
[7178.43s -> 7178.99s]  Uh-oh.
[7178.99s -> 7179.95s]  Fuck, who is this?
[7185.56s -> 7186.12s]  Oh, shit.
[7192.52s -> 7193.00s]  Let's get him.
[7197.72s -> 7204.75s]  Oh, that hurt a lot.
[7208.70s -> 7210.14s]  Oh, that hurts a lot too.
[7211.10s -> 7215.55s]  Oh, that hurt real bad.
[7216.51s -> 7221.10s]  All right, I gotta get better.
[7221.10s -> 7221.66s]  I gotta get better.
[7221.66s -> 7222.30s]  I gotta get better.
[7223.34s -> 7225.60s]  I gotta get way better than this.
[7225.60s -> 7226.48s]  I gotta be better than this.
[7241.58s -> 7249.21s]  That's fine.
[7249.21s -> 7249.53s]  Back up.
[7252.14s -> 7257.15s]  I gotta parry that.
[7257.79s -> 7261.85s]  That didn't work.
[7276.57s -> 7277.37s]  Parry.
[7277.37s -> 7279.37s]  Is that right?
[7279.37s -> 7280.09s]  I don't think it was right.
[7281.71s -> 7300.99s]  Oh, shit.
[7300.99s -> 7302.67s]  He's open.
[7302.67s -> 7303.07s]  Is he?
[7305.07s -> 7305.95s]  I love that.
[7305.95s -> 7306.43s]  It's so...
[7307.23s -> 7309.55s]  It's just like dialing up to 100.
[7309.55s -> 7310.35s]  Now, Clive.
[7310.35s -> 7310.99s]  How about it?
[7329.37s -> 7330.65s]  I think he's spitting up.
[7340.08s -> 7340.40s]  Whoa.
[7347.15s -> 7356.92s]  Oh, he's got a combo.
[7356.92s -> 7368.40s]  Send it.
[7372.40s -> 7375.44s]  I forgot my cool combo.
[7375.44s -> 7376.40s]  It was cool, I promise.
[7377.20s -> 7406.00s]  Oh, dude, I'm so glad this game
[7406.00s -> 7407.68s]  isn't coming out like next year.
[7408.24s -> 7409.04s]  Do you know what I mean?
[7409.12s -> 7409.60s]  Look at it.
[7421.60s -> 7423.90s]  Night of the blinding dawn slain.
[7434.92s -> 7438.17s]  That music is just...
[7438.73s -> 7439.77s]  All right, you know when you play a game
[7439.77s -> 7441.13s]  and it's just, you know,
[7441.13s -> 7443.45s]  the music is kind of going
[7443.45s -> 7444.81s]  and it fits and you're just like, yep.
[7446.19s -> 7447.79s]  I almost play to the beat.
[7447.79s -> 7448.67s]  Do you guys do that too?
[7448.67s -> 7460.09s]  I'm fine.
[7466.35s -> 7468.51s]  So they sent in the Dragoons.
[7469.15s -> 7470.72s]  Imperial vipers.
[7471.82s -> 7473.66s]  Do they really mean to invade us?
[7474.30s -> 7476.38s]  Yeah, June 22nd.
[7476.38s -> 7476.86s]  Not yet.
[7476.86s -> 7478.06s]  For PS5, yeah.
[7478.06s -> 7479.10s]  Their numbers were too few.
[7480.41s -> 7481.93s]  They were not here to take the castle.
[7483.28s -> 7484.48s]  They were here to take heads.
[7486.72s -> 7487.52s]  Our work is done.
[7488.24s -> 7489.44s]  We should return to my father.
[7490.48s -> 7491.68s]  My lord, look.
[7493.34s -> 7495.42s]  We issued these sashes, but yesterday...
[7495.42s -> 7497.50s]  You're saying I wonder how deep the skill system gets
[7497.50s -> 7498.06s]  in the full game?
[7499.10s -> 7499.50s]  I don't know.
[7499.50s -> 7500.14s]  That's a good question.
[7501.02s -> 7502.62s]  Father and Joshua are in danger.
[7502.62s -> 7503.74s]  We must hurry.
[7503.74s -> 7504.54s]  Take your steed.
[7505.34s -> 7513.21s]  What is that?
[7528.67s -> 7529.95s]  You just mouth fuck you to me?
[7530.75s -> 7545.31s]  I read lips.
[7550.17s -> 7551.05s]  The dog is fine.
[7551.05s -> 7553.37s]  Everybody was freaking out about that.
[7557.40s -> 7559.08s]  Your grace, is everyone safe?
[7559.64s -> 7564.43s]  For the moment, we ride for Rosalith to rally our forces.
[7564.43s -> 7567.39s]  I will need your help to see Joshua safely back to the capital.
[7569.61s -> 7570.57s]  On you get, Joshua.
[7576.92s -> 7577.56s]  What the hell?
[7580.68s -> 7581.56s]  What the fuck was that?
[7582.20s -> 7585.24s]  I'm sorry, your grace, but that won't be possible.
[7587.23s -> 7587.73s]  Hey.
[7588.43s -> 7588.93s]  Oh.
[7591.37s -> 7591.87s]  Snakes!
[7591.87s -> 7592.57s]  Stay back!
[7592.57s -> 7593.21s]  I'm warning you!
[7593.21s -> 7593.93s]  Run, Joshua!
[7593.93s -> 7594.43s]  Run!
[7594.57s -> 7595.07s]  No!
[7595.45s -> 7595.95s]  Hey!
[7610.43s -> 7611.07s]  Oh, no.
[7611.87s -> 7613.31s]  I think we're gonna lose...
[7613.31s -> 7615.92s]  I think we're gonna lose another one.
[7616.72s -> 7625.84s]  You must do your duty, too.
[7627.28s -> 7631.10s]  Father safe.
[7631.90s -> 7632.62s]  I have to.
[7633.50s -> 7636.38s]  I had to.
[7637.42s -> 7646.99s]  No!
[7647.37s -> 7647.87s]  I...
[7648.33s -> 7650.65s]  On you, Joshua.
[7652.17s -> 7653.53s]  Oh, he...
[7653.53s -> 7654.03s]  Okay.
[7654.57s -> 7655.61s]  He's the phoenix.
[7656.49s -> 7659.07s]  He's the phoenix.
[7690.46s -> 7690.96s]  He's...
[7692.94s -> 7693.44s]  Phoenix?
[7695.42s -> 7700.09s]  Joshua!
[7700.09s -> 7701.85s]  Oh, this is where we start here.
[7702.65s -> 7710.76s]  He's lost control.
[7711.48s -> 7712.84s]  I have to do something.
[7713.48s -> 7714.36s]  I have to save him.
[7714.36s -> 7714.86s]  No!
[7714.86s -> 7715.72s]  My lord.
[7715.72s -> 7716.22s]  Fall back!
[7723.93s -> 7724.43s]  Oh.
[7725.29s -> 7727.53s]  Ow.
[7727.53s -> 7731.41s]  Oh, no.
[7731.41s -> 7731.91s]  Chocobo!
[7732.51s -> 7736.36s]  Thank you, God.
[7736.36s -> 7737.16s]  You saved my life.
[7739.04s -> 7744.72s]  I'm gonna fit and run.
[7746.12s -> 7746.62s]  Please.
[7748.91s -> 7753.87s]  Joshua.
[7754.25s -> 7755.05s]  Are you in pain?
[7756.25s -> 7763.76s]  You're his shield.
[7764.64s -> 7766.62s]  Do your duty.
[7767.66s -> 7769.30s]  What?
[7771.10s -> 7771.60s]  Save him.
[7775.87s -> 7776.37s]  My lord.
[7801.48s -> 7802.84s]  Second icon of fire.
[7803.88s -> 7805.28s]  That's impossible.
[7808.06s -> 7808.62s]  Whoa!
[7808.62s -> 7809.42s]  Wait, did I...
[7809.42s -> 7810.14s]  Wait, what?
[7810.94s -> 7812.06s]  Oh, my God.
[7813.18s -> 7814.46s]  I need to check the lore.
[7814.46s -> 7815.50s]  I have to check the lore.
[7815.90s -> 7816.40s]  Who?
[7816.54s -> 7817.04s]  Who?
[7817.26s -> 7817.82s]  What happened?
[7819.10s -> 7822.30s]  Firstborn son of Archduke Elwyn, ruler of Rosaria,
[7822.30s -> 7826.62s]  through all expected him to inherit the phoenix's flames and awaken as its dominant,
[7826.62s -> 7829.74s]  destiny instead chose his younger brother Joshua to bear that burden.
[7829.74s -> 7831.82s]  In search of a role of his own,
[7831.82s -> 7834.62s]  Clive dedicated himself to mastering the blade
[7834.62s -> 7837.82s]  and his practice paid off when he was appointed first shield of Rosaria.
[7837.82s -> 7839.04s]  Okay.
[7839.04s -> 7846.57s]  Tasked to guard the phoenix and blessed with the ability to wield a part of his fire.
[7846.57s -> 7847.07s]  Okay.
[7847.69s -> 7861.68s]  Do I actually get to walk around
[7861.68s -> 7863.12s]  and play as this character?
[7876.86s -> 7877.36s]  And this is...
[7892.73s -> 7893.69s]  What the fuck?
[7894.41s -> 7894.91s]  Okay.
[7896.17s -> 7897.93s]  So, we're do...
[7897.93s -> 7898.43s]  We are...
[7904.48s -> 7905.84s]  Embodying the phoenix.
[7905.84s -> 7908.16s]  The following commands are available when playing as the phoenix.
[7908.16s -> 7909.84s]  Fire, aim, and evade.
[7909.84s -> 7912.48s]  When your opponent is directly within your sights,
[7912.48s -> 7913.68s]  the targeting circle will expand.
[7913.68s -> 7914.96s]  That is the time to fire.
[7915.76s -> 7916.26s]  Okay.
[7922.41s -> 7923.77s]  Wait, I have to actually aim.
[7936.51s -> 7950.82s]  Here we go.
[7963.56s -> 7966.28s]  We both go horizontal on a 2D plane.
[7966.28s -> 7967.24s]  It just goes...
[7967.24s -> 7969.24s]  3, 2, 1, fight!
[7977.82s -> 7978.54s]  Uh oh.
[7978.54s -> 7979.04s]  Okay.
[7987.56s -> 7995.08s]  All right, I think I'm gonna get...
[7995.08s -> 7995.88s]  Here we go.
[7998.43s -> 7998.93s]  Oh!
[7999.96s -> 8001.80s]  All right, when he glows like that's when I have to dodge.
[8002.52s -> 8011.32s]  Here it comes.
[8012.20s -> 8013.00s]  No, not yet.
[8013.88s -> 8024.70s]  Well, I'm shooting a lot of fireballs too.
[8024.70s -> 8025.74s]  It's not just him.
[8055.74s -> 8056.24s]  Shoot him!
[8056.78s -> 8073.04s]  All right, I gotta be ready to evade.
[8073.04s -> 8073.60s]  Here it comes.
[8074.32s -> 8077.39s]  Oh, that was actually pretty close.
[8077.39s -> 8090.80s]  Stop jumping around!
[8091.36s -> 8093.82s]  Do I have to dodge that?
[8098.44s -> 8099.40s]  Where is he?
[8100.28s -> 8100.78s]  Jesus.
[8101.48s -> 8105.07s]  Oh my god, dude.
[8105.07s -> 8127.95s]  Now we're on the offensive.
[8127.95s -> 8128.45s]  All right.
[8130.35s -> 8135.95s]  I love the icons.
[8136.75s -> 8139.93s]  The top left and top right.
[8140.65s -> 8154.19s]  Oh, I am shooting a million fireballs right now.
[8159.93s -> 8160.43s]  Sorry.
[8160.89s -> 8163.15s]  I don't think I'm getting away from this.
[8164.03s -> 8175.63s]  Oh my god, I was so paying no attention.
[8175.63s -> 8176.91s]  I was just spamming and I wasn't...
[8176.91s -> 8185.60s]  I forgot I had to actually dodge.
[8185.60s -> 8186.40s]  Damnation?
[8187.88s -> 8188.38s]  In...
[8188.92s -> 8189.80s]  How many seconds?
[8199.66s -> 8200.46s]  Hellfire?
[8201.02s -> 8208.83s]  Uh oh.
[8208.91s -> 8209.47s]  Dude, he just...
[8210.11s -> 8210.51s]  He just...
[8212.43s -> 8212.93s]  Wait.
[8216.01s -> 8217.37s]  What is going on right now?
[8217.37s -> 8218.73s]  I mean, it's fucking awesome.
[8218.73s -> 8219.93s]  But what is happening?
[8220.65s -> 8228.40s]  Okay.
[8228.40s -> 8231.23s]  I should have done a lore check.
[8231.23s -> 8235.76s]  Like, that was kind of like
[8235.76s -> 8237.84s]  when a company does an E3 presentation
[8238.91s -> 8240.59s]  and it's like, look at this game that we've got!
[8241.15s -> 8242.67s]  Our E3 presentation!
[8244.32s -> 8245.52s]  That actually happened in the game.
[8246.08s -> 8247.61s]  That happened in the game.
[8248.41s -> 8248.91s]  Here.
[8251.40s -> 8254.12s]  We got to see like an E3 presentation
[8254.12s -> 8262.03s]  that actually made it through into the video game.
[8262.03s -> 8262.83s]  That was fucking cool.
[8272.40s -> 8273.12s]  Hashtag ad?
[8273.12s -> 8274.40s]  Yes, of course hashtag ad.
[8274.40s -> 8275.92s]  But the game is fucking phenomenal.
[8275.92s -> 8276.42s]  Okay.
[8284.72s -> 8286.32s]  I'm having a ton of fun.
[8286.32s -> 8287.44s]  I want to play way more of this.
[8288.24s -> 8292.08s]  Combat was really fun.
[8294.97s -> 8295.77s]  I think I could get in...
[8295.77s -> 8296.89s]  I think I could actually get into it.
[8309.66s -> 8312.06s]  Just the fighting is just so much different
[8312.06s -> 8314.38s]  than what I've ever played with Final Fantasy.
[8316.65s -> 8317.15s]  Round two?
[8329.05s -> 8330.01s]  What the fuck?
[8330.73s -> 8331.69s]  This is awful.
[8333.90s -> 8334.70s]  This is awful.
[8352.14s -> 8352.86s]  What is going on?
[8356.24s -> 8356.74s]  Stop it!
[8357.98s -> 8360.35s]  Stop it!
[8360.35s -> 8361.31s]  I swore!
[8362.03s -> 8368.03s]  I will beat you!
[8368.03s -> 8370.56s]  Beat you!
[8390.75s -> 8391.55s]  Wait, what?
[8394.48s -> 8395.36s]  Is the dog?
[8396.32s -> 8408.88s]  Holy shit!
[8418.14s -> 8419.58s]  I'll kill you!
[8419.58s -> 8440.96s]  I can't kill you!
[8440.96s -> 8444.67s]  Damn.
[8444.67s -> 8448.25s]  Please do a lore check, please.
[8448.25s -> 8449.13s]  Oh, we...
[8449.13s -> 8462.16s]  Sorry, I missed it.
[8462.16s -> 8463.04s]  When we started here,
[8464.32s -> 8465.04s]  I was like, all right,
[8465.04s -> 8466.40s]  I'm not sure where we're going with it.
[8467.12s -> 8473.79s]  But I was not expecting any of that.
[8473.79s -> 8476.73s]  That we're just going to be as a band of
[8477.93s -> 8478.43s]  adventurers.
[8502.25s -> 8503.05s]  Can't believe it.
[8514.32s -> 8518.92s]  Make sure to walk over very
[8519.00s -> 8520.44s]  evilly, too, while you're at it.
[8534.20s -> 8534.76s]  Kill him?
[8558.86s -> 8559.82s]  What the fuck?
[8559.82s -> 8562.06s]  Oh my god, dude.
[8562.06s -> 8562.86s]  What the hell?
[8564.44s -> 8566.12s]  You all didn't think we were going here.
[8566.12s -> 8567.00s]  None of you did.
[8567.00s -> 8568.12s]  None of you did.
[8568.12s -> 8569.08s]  Chin up, lad.
[8569.08s -> 8569.88s]  None of you did.
[8570.76s -> 8572.76s]  You're going to be a soldier.
[8573.88s -> 8574.38s]  Why?
[8574.92s -> 8575.42s]  What?
[8575.96s -> 8586.65s]  My goodness.
[8586.65s -> 8587.15s]  Okay.
[8588.03s -> 8591.61s]  Well, I'm very interested.
[8592.86s -> 8595.10s]  Thank you for watching this.
[8595.10s -> 8595.66s]  Yeah.
[8595.66s -> 8597.87s]  Thank you for playing.
[8597.87s -> 8599.63s]  You've completed the Final Fantasy XVI demo,
[8599.63s -> 8602.64s]  but there's still much more story to tell.
[8602.64s -> 8605.76s]  You'd like to learn more of Clive and the dominance.
[8605.76s -> 8607.68s]  Please consider purchasing the main game.
[8607.68s -> 8613.31s]  Consider me considering.
[8613.31s -> 8614.27s]  You know what I mean?
[8614.27s -> 8619.21s]  That was great.
[8619.21s -> 8621.37s]  So I will absolutely be playing this again.
[8621.37s -> 8623.23s]  You'll see it again.
[8625.44s -> 8628.72s]  I wish I could kind of keep playing right now.
[8631.68s -> 8642.94s]  When does this come out?
[8642.94s -> 8643.90s]  Playthrough data saved.
[8643.90s -> 8645.98s]  Playthrough data can be carried over to the main game,
[8645.98s -> 8648.86s]  allowing you to continue from where you left off in the demo.
[8648.86s -> 8652.14s]  Demo playthrough data cannot be loaded in the demo version.
[8652.14s -> 8653.34s]  To play the demo again,
[8653.34s -> 8660.76s]  you must select new game from the title screen.
[8660.76s -> 8662.36s]  I have to pee so bad.
[8662.36s -> 8663.56s]  I will be right back.
[8664.12s -> 8666.24s]  But that's great.
[8666.24s -> 8668.40s]  Again, yes, this is a sponsored segment of the stream.
[8668.40s -> 8670.56s]  Square Enix, thanks for sponsoring the stream.
[8670.56s -> 8672.24s]  And obviously Final Fantasy XVI.
[8674.60s -> 8676.60s]  Demo, you can go get it right now.
[8676.60s -> 8680.60s]  It's a free demo on the PS5 store.
[8680.60s -> 8684.62s]  If you want to check it out for yourself, you can.
[8684.62s -> 8685.42s]  That was great.
[8685.42s -> 8687.21s]  I liked it a lot.
[8687.21s -> 8688.33s]  Don't save the game.
[8688.33s -> 8688.97s]  Don't save.
[8688.97s -> 8689.69s]  Don't save.
[8689.69s -> 8695.12s]  Don't save.
[8695.12s -> 8695.84s]  Should I save?
[8695.84s -> 8697.20s]  No, no, I should save, right?
[8697.20s -> 8697.68s]  I will.
[8697.68s -> 8698.08s]  I gotta pee.
[8698.08s -> 8698.56s]  I'll be right back.
[8698.56s -> 8699.36s]  Give me one second.
[8699.36s -> 8822.36s]  Okay, I am back.
[8822.36s -> 8824.25s]  So there's more to the demo.
[8824.89s -> 8827.02s]  What more is there to do?
[8835.21s -> 8836.33s]  More to do.
[8836.33s -> 8840.12s]  Okay, so I got it saved.
[8840.12s -> 8843.04s]  Just kind of back up.
[8843.04s -> 8846.22s]  Purchase from PlayStation Store.
[8846.22s -> 8848.22s]  Digital Deluxe or the base game.
[8849.26s -> 8856.54s]  Okay, well, there's another mid-game mission.
[8856.54s -> 8857.18s]  Really?
[8857.18s -> 8862.00s]  Go back to the title screen?
[8862.00s -> 8863.04s]  Wait, are people...
[8863.04s -> 8863.76s]  I think that's the end.
[8864.40s -> 8865.52s]  I don't think there's anything else.
[8866.24s -> 8868.73s]  I'll go back to the title screen.
[8868.73s -> 8870.41s]  Ah, there is.
[8870.41s -> 8871.13s]  There is.
[8871.13s -> 8872.65s]  Okay, there is more to look at.
[8873.29s -> 8874.89s]  The iconic challenge has been unlocked
[8874.89s -> 8876.33s]  and is now available from the title menu.
[8876.33s -> 8878.65s]  In this special mode set later in the game.
[8878.65s -> 8881.00s]  Clive has been equipped with the feats and abilities
[8881.00s -> 8882.68s]  of three unique icons.
[8882.68s -> 8885.26s]  The Phoenix, Garuda, and Titan.
[8885.26s -> 8886.68s]  To allow you to get a better feel
[8886.68s -> 8889.72s]  of Final Fantasy XVI's exciting battle system.
[8889.72s -> 8892.19s]  Well, we're doing that.
[8892.83s -> 8895.66s]  Okay, note.
[8897.18s -> 8899.90s]  This challenge was created specifically for this demo
[8899.90s -> 8901.34s]  and its features differ slightly
[8901.34s -> 8902.86s]  from what appears in the final game.
[8903.42s -> 8905.26s]  Gear, items, abilities are not representative
[8905.26s -> 8906.30s]  of what normally...
[8906.86s -> 8908.38s]  What are normally available to Clive
[8908.38s -> 8910.38s]  during this part of the story.
[8910.38s -> 8911.63s]  Makes sense.
[8914.49s -> 8916.09s]  The world map and journal have been removed
[8916.09s -> 8916.97s]  from the main menu.
[8916.97s -> 8919.21s]  Save, autosave, and load functionality is unavailable.
[8919.93s -> 8922.65s]  So, this is exclusive for the demo
[8922.65s -> 8923.93s]  and it's not going to spoil anything.
[8923.93s -> 8924.41s]  That's cool.
[8924.97s -> 8927.16s]  I think we already know this, right?
[8927.72s -> 8930.64s]  Do we know this?
[8931.20s -> 8934.52s]  We know this, right?
[8935.40s -> 8936.28s]  Is there spoilers here?
[8936.84s -> 8939.58s]  This is new.
[8939.58s -> 8941.50s]  It will spoil, but just a small section.
[8942.14s -> 8946.57s]  There's some story, but we don't know broader context.
[8946.57s -> 8947.37s]  There's spoilers?
[8947.37s -> 8948.49s]  Very mild spoilers?
[8948.49s -> 8948.99s]  Okay.
[8949.37s -> 8953.77s]  Well, it said they made it specifically for the demo.
[8953.77s -> 8956.46s]  I'm imagining it's an early part of the game.
[8957.02s -> 8958.14s]  Yeah, okay.
[8958.14s -> 8959.74s]  All right, we join the two as they begin
[8959.74s -> 8962.70s]  their infiltration of Chyre Norvent,
[8962.70s -> 8964.22s]  an ancient stronghold wherein his brother
[8964.22s -> 8966.46s]  is supposed to kill her, a second dominant of fire.
[8966.46s -> 8968.30s]  He's said to be held by an elite party of
[8968.86s -> 8973.02s]  Weloder Knights, commanded by Benedicta Harmon.
[8973.02s -> 8976.81s]  Okay, so 13 years have passed since their tragic events
[8976.81s -> 8978.17s]  which saw Clive robbed of his brother,
[8978.17s -> 8979.13s]  his father, and his home.
[8979.85s -> 8981.12s]  Okay.
[8981.12s -> 8983.80s]  He runs his freedom in the hands of a man named Sid
[8983.80s -> 8986.12s]  who agrees to aid our hero in his search for answers.
[8986.12s -> 8986.84s]  Okay.
[8986.84s -> 8989.07s]  I think it's spoiling what we just saw
[8989.07s -> 8992.03s]  and maybe like a little tiny little snippet.
[8992.03s -> 8997.66s]  I would be surprised if they would spoil something in a demo.
[8997.66s -> 9000.30s]  And we're probably gonna get some pretty out of context things.
[9017.15s -> 9017.63s]  Lore check?
[9017.63s -> 9018.83s]  No, I'm not doing a lore check.
[9018.83s -> 9019.33s]  Not now.
[9024.91s -> 9026.67s]  They've also said this won't be exactly the same
[9026.75s -> 9027.31s]  as the game.
[9027.31s -> 9028.43s]  It'll be changed.
[9028.43s -> 9029.55s]  That's actually really smart.
[9030.19s -> 9031.47s]  That's a smart thing.
[9031.47s -> 9032.91s]  Like, oh, hey, yeah, we're just making it.
[9032.91s -> 9034.51s]  The cut scenes just different
[9034.51s -> 9036.91s]  and the characters are not even the fucking same probably.
[9036.91s -> 9038.27s]  We just, we just made this up.
[9039.31s -> 9057.02s]  Okay.
[9057.02s -> 9057.98s]  Well, that's fucking awesome.
[9058.78s -> 9064.04s]  I don't know the context, but I now know context
[9064.04s -> 9066.68s]  that dog is playable character in game.
[9066.68s -> 9069.16s]  Now, now we're really cooking.
[9069.16s -> 9073.31s]  As L to the cycle between currently attuned icons
[9073.31s -> 9077.12s]  in real time, cool down times for iconic abilities
[9077.12s -> 9078.64s]  are displayed around the corresponding icon.
[9078.64s -> 9079.14s]  Okay.
[9079.78s -> 9081.81s]  So everything has to cool down so you can switch.
[9086.19s -> 9087.07s]  He's everywhere.
[9087.07s -> 9088.59s]  That actor is everywhere now.
[9089.15s -> 9096.98s]  I hear him every fucking day, but he's got a,
[9096.98s -> 9099.06s]  he's got a great voice, right?
[9099.86s -> 9100.10s]  All right.
[9100.10s -> 9108.88s]  So what I can change to, how do I swap?
[9112.53s -> 9114.29s]  Oh, I see what's going on.
[9115.01s -> 9116.02s]  All right.
[9116.02s -> 9117.46s]  Let's do deadly embrace.
[9137.62s -> 9139.14s]  He's gonna be great in this game
[9139.14s -> 9144.75s]  to I can already tell they're all empty.
[9148.66s -> 9154.56s]  They're all empty.
[9154.56s -> 9161.17s]  Sid, this gate needs some help.
[9161.73s -> 9165.87s]  You can still skip as an adult.
[9165.87s -> 9166.37s]  Yes.
[9173.84s -> 9183.68s]  Oh, wait, there's more to the demo.
[9183.68s -> 9184.18s]  Yeah.
[9184.64s -> 9186.96s]  So there is a, we didn't know this until the very end,
[9186.96s -> 9190.24s]  but there's like a little snippet from the middle of the game
[9190.24s -> 9191.28s]  that they tried to make sure
[9191.28s -> 9192.80s]  there wasn't very many spoilers in it.
[9192.80s -> 9194.56s]  And it's just, Hey, take a look at some more
[9194.56s -> 9196.24s]  of the combat shit for like a minute or two
[9196.24s -> 9197.04s]  while you have a minute.
[9228.53s -> 9230.05s]  What about these other moves?
[9230.05s -> 9235.65s]  Let's just do a limit break.
[9235.65s -> 9236.15s]  Fuck it.
[9253.66s -> 9255.66s]  I thought he just burped really loud.
[9255.66s -> 9256.78s]  That was a dog growling.
[9266.86s -> 9269.02s]  Devil May Cry designers chops are showing here.
[9270.98s -> 9273.30s]  Yeah, it's going to be fun.
[9273.30s -> 9275.14s]  This tour only leads to more royalists.
[9275.94s -> 9277.14s]  We'd better find another one.
[9279.30s -> 9280.02s]  Read the abilities.
[9282.13s -> 9284.13s]  Rising flames, scarlet cyclone.
[9285.89s -> 9288.13s]  Oh, it's been quickly creating a ring of fire.
[9289.26s -> 9290.06s]  Look at that.
[9291.92s -> 9292.42s]  What?
[9292.96s -> 9295.76s]  Oh, I am pogging in real life.
[9302.70s -> 9303.18s]  Gouge.
[9303.18s -> 9305.50s]  Some twin claws that relentlessly tear at a target
[9305.50s -> 9306.54s]  can be used in midair.
[9308.74s -> 9310.50s]  Rising attacks, breaking all enemies within range.
[9311.14s -> 9315.66s]  Punch forward, hold button to wind up attack,
[9315.66s -> 9316.94s]  further increasing potency.
[9316.94s -> 9317.58s]  Oh, okay.
[9317.58s -> 9317.98s]  So you do it.
[9317.98s -> 9319.34s]  Let it go in the red, probably.
[9319.34s -> 9334.26s]  Where are we going?
[9334.26s -> 9337.22s]  I'm just not that one, obviously.
[9338.58s -> 9341.78s]  Am I going the right way?
[9342.34s -> 9347.06s]  Am I going the wrong way?
[9347.06s -> 9350.42s]  Okay.
[9356.46s -> 9357.66s]  Just not that way.
[9364.82s -> 9365.86s]  It runs pretty well.
[9367.50s -> 9369.02s]  I have the framerate mode turned on,
[9369.02s -> 9372.26s]  but it seems to be pretty clean.
[9373.14s -> 9375.25s]  Where am I going?
[9375.89s -> 9381.41s]  How come my screen is darker than the stream screen?
[9381.41s -> 9381.91s]  I don't know why.
[9382.61s -> 9383.26s]  Hold up.
[9383.26s -> 9383.74s]  Oh, right.
[9383.74s -> 9385.82s]  If I have the mode where I can see things.
[9386.46s -> 9391.81s]  Oh, it is right here.
[9392.77s -> 9399.31s]  Use the animal instinct.
[9406.61s -> 9407.65s]  Can you please pet the dog?
[9408.45s -> 9409.81s]  Find out.
[9412.54s -> 9416.03s]  Probably not in a combat scenario.
[9431.20s -> 9435.31s]  Holy shit.
[9435.31s -> 9436.99s]  Whoa, there's more to the, there's a second part.
[9437.71s -> 9439.71s]  They all were like flying in like, they like,
[9440.35s -> 9440.99s]  I can't even talk.
[9443.31s -> 9453.94s]  I'm gonna try the phoenix move.
[9456.22s -> 9456.62s]  Distance.
[9461.26s -> 9461.76s]  Cool.
[9466.03s -> 9468.43s]  Why bright and magic ash?
[9469.07s -> 9473.30s]  Did I miss any items or anything?
[9473.86s -> 9479.41s]  Can we get a bald cam, please?
[9480.45s -> 9481.25s]  Maybe on your birthday.
[9481.81s -> 9501.22s]  Oh, you can really chain stuff together.
[9502.02s -> 9504.19s]  That's enough.
[9507.18s -> 9507.50s]  All right.
[9507.50s -> 9508.86s]  The chains are going to be fun.
[9511.23s -> 9513.62s]  I think I got to turn my brightness up a little.
[9514.90s -> 9518.78s]  Let's see.
[9518.78s -> 9520.13s]  Can I do it from here?
[9529.10s -> 9531.02s]  Camera settings, graphic settings.
[9531.02s -> 9531.66s]  Screen brightness.
[9532.38s -> 9539.52s]  All right.
[9539.52s -> 9542.38s]  That's better.
[9542.38s -> 9542.86s]  There we go.
[9546.54s -> 9547.98s]  What about you have a light?
[9547.98s -> 9548.86s]  You have a light.
[9548.86s -> 9549.34s]  I can wait.
[9549.90s -> 9550.86s]  Can I turn the light on?
[9550.86s -> 9551.82s]  I have a light move.
[9552.38s -> 9552.88s]  Do I?
[9553.50s -> 9558.80s]  How do I do the light move?
[9559.36s -> 9566.00s]  I don't think so.
[9571.66s -> 9572.78s]  It's on the phoenix.
[9572.78s -> 9573.28s]  Oh, okay.
[9578.90s -> 9579.86s]  Wait, that's a block.
[9580.74s -> 9582.56s]  I wonder how much it blocks.
[9595.23s -> 9595.73s]  Damn.
[9604.64s -> 9605.04s]  Shit.
[9605.04s -> 9605.54s]  I missed it.
[9620.93s -> 9622.21s]  Just 5,000 damage.
[9622.21s -> 9622.71s]  All right.
[9624.42s -> 9624.92s]  There, boy.
[9625.94s -> 9626.82s]  Sicko Togo.
[9627.94s -> 9635.33s]  That was a good parry.
[9638.90s -> 9640.42s]  Sicko Togo.
[9640.42s -> 9646.92s]  Wait.
[9647.22s -> 9655.59s]  Oh, it's turning.
[9655.59s -> 9656.09s]  Woo.
[9663.48s -> 9664.63s]  This guy.
[9664.63s -> 9665.99s]  Yeah, this guy does not stand a chance.
[9667.11s -> 9670.92s]  Crush him.
[9671.54s -> 9682.52s]  Any item?
[9682.52s -> 9684.80s]  This map feels nostalgic.
[9686.79s -> 9690.87s]  There are probably some nods to the previous games or previous things.
[9690.87s -> 9691.99s]  There usually is, isn't there?
[9691.99s -> 9696.52s]  I don't know what hit them.
[9696.52s -> 9697.40s]  Aver of fire.
[9698.04s -> 9711.89s]  All is after them.
[9711.97s -> 9716.16s]  My birthday is on August 2nd.
[9716.16s -> 9717.36s]  Please do a bald cam.
[9717.36s -> 9718.40s]  I swear I'll...
[9718.40s -> 9718.90s]  Okay.
[9722.05s -> 9725.17s]  Attacking an opponent from the front while it is guarding will deal no damage.
[9725.17s -> 9727.01s]  Circle to the rear to penetrate its defenses.
[9727.73s -> 9731.97s]  Certain basic abilities such as Burning Blade and Charged Magic,
[9731.97s -> 9735.17s]  as well as iconic abilities such as the Phoenix Rising Flames,
[9735.17s -> 9737.81s]  can instantly break an opponent's guard when delivered from the front.
[9737.81s -> 9738.31s]  Okay.
[9738.85s -> 9739.98s]  Good to know.
[9750.55s -> 9753.91s]  Back it up.
[9767.75s -> 9768.71s]  New enemies coming up?
[9768.71s -> 9769.21s]  Whatever.
[9779.21s -> 9779.93s]  Let me try this.
[9786.74s -> 9787.38s]  All right, I can't...
[9788.26s -> 9791.30s]  When the game comes out, I think I'm doing the titanic stuff.
[9792.18s -> 9793.99s]  Feels really strong.
[9794.55s -> 9809.24s]  Anybody else?
[9816.10s -> 9823.27s]  I don't know who to swing at, but...
[9827.61s -> 9835.13s]  Jesus.
[9846.14s -> 9848.70s]  So what are the two bars under my health?
[9849.42s -> 9857.45s]  I wonder.
[9857.45s -> 9863.13s]  Oops.
[9863.13s -> 9864.17s]  That's Limit Break.
[9864.17s -> 9864.67s]  Ah.
[9868.97s -> 9879.14s]  All right, time for a Limit Break.
[9879.14s -> 9886.17s]  I gotta get used to that.
[9886.17s -> 9890.01s]  You're playing the game on easy right now?
[9890.01s -> 9891.37s]  You have the rings on?
[9891.37s -> 9891.85s]  It's okay.
[9891.85s -> 9895.85s]  I think they put them on to make it so you can see just how wild some of the combos can get.
[9938.06s -> 9940.06s]  Where are the men and women you took from Lostwing?
[9940.87s -> 9942.15s]  You mean where's the dominant?
[9942.87s -> 9945.75s]  Well, he shall be requiring his services indefinitely.
[9945.75s -> 9948.15s]  I don't know who this is, but I'm sure we'll find out.
[9948.15s -> 9949.27s]  Come back to me, Sedolphus.
[9949.27s -> 9949.99s]  I need you.
[9950.55s -> 9952.87s]  Think of all the things we can create together.
[9954.47s -> 9956.23s]  The world that we can build.
[9956.95s -> 9958.07s]  You need me.
[9959.99s -> 9961.75s]  Your king needs me.
[9961.75s -> 9963.51s]  I'm all for building a new world.
[9964.63s -> 9965.59s]  Just not his.
[9965.59s -> 9967.19s]  Oh, the dog is also agreeing.
[9967.19s -> 9969.91s]  His dreams are as twisted as his promises are false.
[9970.71s -> 9970.87s]  Yeah.
[9970.87s -> 9972.31s]  I want no part of him.
[9972.31s -> 9973.51s]  We don't want anything to do with you.
[9973.51s -> 9976.71s]  He's the one who saved you, and this is how you speak of him.
[9976.71s -> 9978.39s]  Have you no shred of loyalty?
[9980.95s -> 9984.89s]  To a leader who'd use me like he uses you.
[9985.85s -> 9988.25s]  You know nothing of me, Sedolphus.
[9988.25s -> 9988.81s]  You're right.
[9989.94s -> 9993.48s]  I don't know who you are anymore or what you want.
[9994.04s -> 9997.70s]  I only know what you used to say.
[9999.42s -> 10000.94s]  That you were tired of running.
[10001.50s -> 10005.19s]  That you just wanted to be free.
[10005.27s -> 10005.99s]  Free of it all.
[10005.99s -> 10006.71s]  Yeah, the demo is over.
[10006.71s -> 10010.79s]  This is just like extra little content.
[10010.79s -> 10014.79s]  What made you think you had to sacrifice who you were to get what you wanted?
[10016.22s -> 10017.02s]  Sacrifice?
[10017.66s -> 10021.74s]  I use my talents to my advantage, and you would tell me there is shame in that?
[10021.74s -> 10025.98s]  If there's no shame, then why do you feel so sorry for yourself?
[10025.98s -> 10027.98s]  Arousing speech, Lord Commander.
[10028.86s -> 10031.42s]  I was a fool to believe you might have changed.
[10032.42s -> 10035.38s]  The only person I feel sorry for is you.
[10037.74s -> 10039.66s]  I can't do this anymore.
[10046.41s -> 10052.46s]  If you would stand between our liege and his dream, then you leave me no choice.
[10054.94s -> 10056.22s]  Goodbye, Sedolphus.
[10068.97s -> 10077.58s]  No, he's getting in.
[10077.58s -> 10079.82s]  He's going to stand like a magical electricity.
[10080.78s -> 10096.71s]  They all have like superpowers in this game.
[10096.71s -> 10099.69s]  It's just wild.
[10133.37s -> 10134.25s]  Is it my turn?
[10135.13s -> 10139.00s]  I think it's my turn.
[10146.31s -> 10146.95s]  Finish them.
[10149.93s -> 10156.42s]  Well, Sid.
[10157.70s -> 10158.20s]  Okay.
[10171.75s -> 10172.71s]  Super move incoming.
[10173.43s -> 10185.78s]  I'm going for a limit break right after this.
[10192.42s -> 10199.95s]  Jesus.
[10206.20s -> 10207.48s]  6,300 damage.
[10211.85s -> 10212.35s]  That hurt.
[10218.46s -> 10219.58s]  I'm getting combo'd.
[10233.98s -> 10234.48s]  Again.
[10247.56s -> 10248.52s]  Sickom Torgal.
[10249.48s -> 10258.57s]  Those actually aren't...
[10258.57s -> 10259.77s]  Those are not easy to hit.
[10260.49s -> 10281.29s]  Do not stand in that.
[10281.85s -> 10285.72s]  I got...
[10286.18s -> 10295.46s]  There's one down.
[10296.26s -> 10307.86s]  She doesn't look happy, Torgal.
[10308.42s -> 10308.92s]  Come on.
[10309.86s -> 10310.60s]  Oh my goodness.
[10314.01s -> 10316.60s]  I got hit by that.
[10317.16s -> 10323.18s]  This has got to be the end right here.
[10327.48s -> 10327.98s]  This time.
[10336.82s -> 10337.62s]  All right, die!
[10337.62s -> 10338.42s]  You're finished.
[10341.08s -> 10341.58s]  Okay.
[10342.20s -> 10347.45s]  I had the rings on.
[10347.45s -> 10348.33s]  It's fine.
[10348.33s -> 10349.05s]  That was still fun.
[10351.37s -> 10351.93s]  Level 13.
[10351.93s -> 10353.45s]  So that's not that much further.
[10354.10s -> 10354.58s]  What are we?
[10354.58s -> 10355.94s]  Level six or seven or something?
[10361.32s -> 10361.82s]  Crafting.
[10362.52s -> 10373.88s]  Is this the full version?
[10374.44s -> 10375.64s]  This is not the full version.
[10375.64s -> 10376.92s]  This is part of the demo.
[10376.92s -> 10380.44s]  When you beat the demo, you can come back and do this little dungeon area.
[10380.44s -> 10382.76s]  It's like a little snippet of the game.
[10391.66s -> 10392.94s]  Why are you doing this to us?
[10392.94s -> 10395.90s]  What, like showing you a fucking cool ass game?
[10395.90s -> 10397.82s]  You have to wait a little bit longer?
[10418.09s -> 10419.85s]  You can't afford to let them leave.
[10420.41s -> 10422.49s]  Remember, she has wings, you don't.
[10423.13s -> 10424.14s]  What about you?
[10425.61s -> 10427.05s]  Before or after I catch my breath.
[10427.05s -> 10427.61s]  I'll be fine.
[10428.17s -> 10429.45s]  It's the demo, for God's sake.
[10430.25s -> 10432.46s]  I'm not gonna do a main character death in the demo.
[10433.42s -> 10434.70s]  What, are you out of your mind?
[10434.70s -> 10435.50s]  Come on, Torgal.
[10436.14s -> 10442.07s]  It's just the demo.
[10442.07s -> 10443.51s]  Can't die in the demo, you know?
[10444.15s -> 10446.89s]  We've already seen the main game.
[10446.89s -> 10449.13s]  He actually has a death scene right here, but they replaced it.
[10471.19s -> 10472.39s]  She must be here somewhere.
[10473.27s -> 10475.83s]  Dude, they've killed like 50 people in the demo.
[10476.15s -> 10478.42s]  Yeah, that's true.
[10490.66s -> 10492.98s]  But were they lore characters?
[10495.26s -> 10496.14s]  They kind of were.
[10502.71s -> 10509.30s]  So some opponents will cast cure spells to heal their allies.
[10509.30s -> 10511.91s]  Defeat these spellcasters first to prevent drawn out battles.
[10513.43s -> 10518.70s]  Or I could just smush everybody.
[10526.54s -> 10527.58s]  Ooh, okay.
[10527.58s -> 10530.52s]  I killed the caster last.
[10531.40s -> 10548.63s]  Take the rings off?
[10550.66s -> 10551.22s]  It's all right.
[10551.22s -> 10551.78s]  It's all right.
[10553.54s -> 10555.54s]  When I play this, I'm not gonna play with the rings.
[10555.94s -> 10557.30s]  But we're just checking it out.
[10558.66s -> 10560.18s]  I didn't play the demo with the rings on.
[10560.18s -> 10561.62s]  Wow, beautiful sky.
[10565.37s -> 10566.57s]  All right, that's cool though.
[10566.57s -> 10568.01s]  You know, that's kind of cool.
[10569.53s -> 10573.86s]  There's a feature in the game where if you just want to kind of relax,
[10575.14s -> 10578.34s]  chill out, watch the story, and just kill stuff.
[10579.22s -> 10579.86s]  That's cool.
[10579.86s -> 10581.54s]  You just put the ring on if you want to do that.
[10582.34s -> 10586.90s]  There's no pressure to do or not to do it.
[10587.46s -> 10597.82s]  Actually, let me do.
[10598.78s -> 10607.42s]  Okay.
[10607.42s -> 10613.08s]  Is there a food mode?
[10614.02s -> 10614.66s]  That?
[10615.54s -> 10617.06s]  I don't know if I would call that food mode.
[10622.26s -> 10624.98s]  Somebody said,
[10624.98s -> 10628.26s]  I don't know if I'm going to spend all the money on the console and the game,
[10629.06s -> 10632.68s]  which is hundreds of dollars to just turn on food mode.
[10637.77s -> 10639.21s]  Yeah, I mean, if you.
[10641.59s -> 10645.78s]  But food mode is available.
[10648.49s -> 10664.34s]  I wonder how much longer this is.
[10668.25s -> 10669.72s]  I am supposed to be dead.
[10672.17s -> 10673.29s]  Wait, where's like the healer?
[10674.25s -> 10675.29s]  No, just group them all up.
[10678.50s -> 10710.10s]  Oh, don't hurt me.
[10710.10s -> 10711.38s]  There's a lot of people in this room.
[10717.21s -> 10729.56s]  Oh, I just blew his head up.
[10732.09s -> 10734.17s]  You still haven't killed the fucking healer.
[10734.17s -> 10735.13s]  Where's the healer?
[10735.13s -> 10735.85s]  All right, you.
[10737.67s -> 10738.63s]  Sorry about that.
[10739.43s -> 10747.82s]  That's a good way to juggle.
[10749.62s -> 10761.05s]  What if I charge this?
[10761.05s -> 10778.97s]  Oh, no, you still sculpting off and on.
[10780.42s -> 10781.38s]  I've been kind of busy lately.
[10781.38s -> 10822.42s]  So let it break staggered.
[10827.83s -> 10828.23s]  Oh, my God.
[10828.23s -> 10828.95s]  These are not charged.
[10830.15s -> 10858.14s]  Let's go string it all together now.
[10858.86s -> 10880.97s]  Smash out.
[10891.62s -> 10897.16s]  This is pretty beefy demo.
[10901.77s -> 10916.34s]  Now we're probably a long game.
[10916.90s -> 10920.86s]  I think most of the Final Fantasies are pretty long.
[10920.86s -> 10922.73s]  There's a lot of content in them usually.
[10923.45s -> 10924.55s]  How long was the last one?
[10924.55s -> 10925.67s]  I'm like Final Fantasy 15.
[10925.67s -> 10928.63s]  Like how if you just did the main campaign and just kind of went through it.
[10929.35s -> 10952.26s]  Give or take how many hours you say it would take to do like 70, 50.
[10953.06s -> 10954.42s]  Yeah, it's probably pretty similar.
[10955.30s -> 10959.70s]  They're like 40 or so.
[10960.26s -> 10968.66s]  I don't know if it's 14 is like 80 hours.
[10968.66s -> 10978.52s]  Finally, I would see one of the boss fights in the game.
[10979.32s -> 10980.76s]  If you don't want to see the boss,
[10980.76s -> 10983.80s]  if you don't want to see what this boss looks like when you fight this,
[10983.80s -> 10988.49s]  but imagine we're about to fight this boss would clock out.
[10991.19s -> 10994.71s]  I confess I expected more from the old man.
[10994.71s -> 10998.71s]  Final Fantasy 14 is like 400 hours.
[10998.71s -> 10999.99s]  And less from you.
[11000.63s -> 11003.43s]  This is the second time you've bested my sisters.
[11005.19s -> 11007.83s]  Men of your talents are rare indeed.
[11007.83s -> 11008.87s]  400.
[11008.87s -> 11010.71s]  Oh, it's an MMO.
[11010.71s -> 11011.35s]  All right, yeah, yeah.
[11011.35s -> 11016.15s]  If there's a hearth you long for, you will find more than enough warmth under my wings.
[11017.11s -> 11019.50s]  You know exactly what I want.
[11020.22s -> 11024.02s]  Hand over the dominant and I'll leave you in peace.
[11024.98s -> 11027.38s]  You would dare to make demands of me?
[11028.82s -> 11031.66s]  Know your place, little lamb.
[11032.62s -> 11036.92s]  Fool is a shepherd who eats every bleat of the flock.
[11038.49s -> 11041.61s]  And I will suffer yours no longer.
[11043.69s -> 11044.33s]  All right, here we go.
[11044.33s -> 11046.49s]  Must I spell it out for you, branded?
[11046.49s -> 11047.45s]  Let's see.
[11047.45s -> 11048.25s]  I'm ready.
[11048.25s -> 11049.05s]  I'm ready to see it.
[11049.05s -> 11050.25s]  No one is listening.
[11050.25s -> 11051.13s]  No one at all.
[11053.05s -> 11058.54s]  Little lamb, to the slaughter with you.
[11062.47s -> 11063.43s]  Okay, okay.
[11065.03s -> 11080.62s]  Come on, quit.
[11106.81s -> 11107.61s]  Oh, what does that mean?
[11108.73s -> 11109.53s]  Okay.
[11119.48s -> 11120.36s]  This is gonna kill her.
[11120.36s -> 11121.64s]  This is gonna literally kill her.
[11126.55s -> 11127.03s]  In the air.
[11137.93s -> 11138.81s]  Oh, shit, that hurt.
[11139.69s -> 11147.91s]  Okay, scripted.
[11169.02s -> 11170.78s]  Uh-oh, now it's for the real fight.
[11187.27s -> 11187.51s]  Wait.
[11189.18s -> 11189.98s]  Oh, we're good.
[11200.54s -> 11200.94s]  Toggle.
[11207.03s -> 11207.27s]  Hey.
[11210.42s -> 11212.89s]  Cry all you like.
[11214.28s -> 11216.44s]  There's no one to save you now.
[11217.08s -> 11218.98s]  Okay.
[11232.18s -> 11235.61s]  I'll take a precise dodge any day.
[11252.39s -> 11252.87s]  Oh, shit.
[11265.83s -> 11269.85s]  Whoa.
[11274.33s -> 11274.65s]  Again.
[11281.48s -> 11282.28s]  Get down from there.
[11283.24s -> 11286.89s]  I gotta charge it up.
[11288.89s -> 11294.36s]  Toast the hurt.
[11294.36s -> 11296.36s]  You land, I'm gonna limit break, and you're dead.
[11296.36s -> 11297.16s]  Toast the hurt.
[11302.60s -> 11303.88s]  Right on top of my okay.
[11304.76s -> 11315.82s]  Oh, there it is.
[11316.46s -> 11332.42s]  Almost 10k.
[11352.31s -> 11353.03s]  Bramble fall.
[11354.87s -> 11364.12s]  If you failed that quick time event, then you just died.
[11376.17s -> 11377.69s]  I love the music changes.
[11378.49s -> 11389.96s]  I gotta get over 10,000 right there.
[11403.14s -> 11403.54s]  Shit.
[11405.62s -> 11411.82s]  Torval is definitely coming back.
[11417.98s -> 11426.57s]  Oh, fuck.
[11426.57s -> 11427.29s]  I'm all right.
[11427.29s -> 11429.77s]  I just legs are broken.
[11437.91s -> 11438.39s]  Jesus.
[11439.75s -> 11445.27s]  Oh, my God.
[11455.30s -> 11467.94s]  It's gonna be like 15,000.
[11468.66s -> 11480.68s]  Whoa.
[11481.72s -> 11494.15s]  Dude, I'm fucking dodging every single thing.
[11494.15s -> 11495.35s]  I don't care if I get the rings on.
[11495.35s -> 11495.83s]  This is fun.
[11496.79s -> 11514.36s]  You know, that hurt a lot.
[11515.16s -> 11537.51s]  This is it.
[11538.47s -> 11538.71s]  Right.
[11539.43s -> 11540.39s]  Crush her head.
[11550.52s -> 11550.92s]  All right.
[11552.89s -> 11554.73s]  That's definitely I want to look at anything else.
[11560.07s -> 11561.11s]  Based easy mode.
[11561.75s -> 11562.47s]  Just for the demo.
[11563.11s -> 11563.59s]  It's all right.
[11564.71s -> 11569.21s]  We just want to see what was possible.
[11574.04s -> 11576.04s]  The answer is simple, Benedicta.
[11577.19s -> 11579.75s]  He was fighting for something he believed in.
[11585.66s -> 11586.94s]  We've played your games.
[11588.49s -> 11590.57s]  Now tell me where he is.
[11591.21s -> 11594.30s]  Who are you?
[11597.21s -> 11598.89s]  Curious to find out who he's talking about.
[11601.13s -> 11604.25s]  The full game comes out on June 22nd.
[11606.89s -> 11612.57s]  Uncover the mysteries of Final Fantasy 16, Clive, Sid, and Torval.
[11614.15s -> 11620.90s]  Their journey does not end here on the PlayStation 5 home entertainment console.
[11636.58s -> 11638.18s]  When it actually is doing that.
[11651.54s -> 11652.02s]  Cool.
[11652.02s -> 11652.34s]  All right.
[11653.22s -> 11653.78s]  I'm down.
[11660.23s -> 11661.59s]  All right, guys, that's going to be it.
[11662.86s -> 11664.46s]  That was Final Fantasy 16's demo.
[11664.46s -> 11665.42s]  It is available right now.
[11665.42s -> 11667.90s]  You can go grab it if you want on the PlayStation 5 store.
[11667.90s -> 11672.70s]  Thank you Square Enix for sponsoring the segment of the stream.
[11672.70s -> 11674.02s]  Had a lot of fun.
[11674.02s -> 11678.73s]  Just a little taste before the launch.
[11678.73s -> 11685.67s]  It's a good place to start too, I would imagine.
[11685.67s -> 11690.49s]  Because honestly, I'm kind of starting with Final Fantasy 16.
[11690.49s -> 11695.35s]  It's been a very long time since I've cared about the franchise at all.
[11695.35s -> 11696.78s]  Very long time.
[11696.78s -> 11702.28s]  The last time I really played a Final Fantasy game, honestly, it has to be back in the Super Nintendo.
[11703.24s -> 11705.00s]  And then a little bit maybe.
[11706.18s -> 11709.37s]  I want to say like a little of seven.
[11709.37s -> 11710.33s]  A little bit.
[11710.33s -> 11711.53s]  A little bit of ten.
[11711.53s -> 11715.42s]  But not really.
[11715.42s -> 11717.94s]  So it's a good place to start.
[11717.94s -> 11721.94s]  But yeah, that concludes the stream tonight.
[11721.94s -> 11727.03s]  Besides the sponsor, obviously the big news about me joining Offbrand.
[11727.03s -> 11727.99s]  I'm really excited, guys.
[11727.99s -> 11729.03s]  I just, I truly am.
[11729.91s -> 11733.29s]  I know we fuck around a lot on this stream, but I hope I can put some,
[11733.93s -> 11740.14s]  I hope I can just put some effort, try to make some good stuff.
[11740.14s -> 11742.73s]  Joining what?
[11743.13s -> 11752.46s]  Okay, for those of you just joining, I have been appointed as chief creative officer of Offbrand.
[11752.46s -> 11756.15s]  Which is Ludwig's company, his media company.
[11756.15s -> 11757.91s]  So I'll be working a lot with Ludwig.
[11757.91s -> 11759.43s]  And obviously the rest of those guys.
[11759.43s -> 11762.60s]  I think we're going to do a lot of really cool stuff.
[11762.60s -> 11765.11s]  I hope so.
[11765.11s -> 11767.77s]  I'm going to try.
[11767.77s -> 11769.93s]  But thanks for watching.
[11769.93s -> 11770.73s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[11771.80s -> 11775.72s]  There will be way more information on this as I get started, as I keep going.
[11775.72s -> 11779.58s]  I know a lot of people were like, holy shit, he's retiring.
[11779.58s -> 11782.01s]  The answer is no, I'm not.
[11782.01s -> 11782.73s]  I'm still streaming.
[11782.73s -> 11783.53s]  I'm still going to be here.
[11783.53s -> 11785.08s]  I'm still hanging out.
[11785.08s -> 11788.98s]  But I will have other duties that I have to do in between streaming.
[11788.98s -> 11792.98s]  So there will be times when I tell you, hey, I got a lot going on with Offbrand.
[11792.98s -> 11794.18s]  I'll see you in like a week or two.
[11794.18s -> 11795.46s]  Do you know what I mean?
[11795.46s -> 11799.48s]  Like it's not, I'm not going anywhere.
[11799.48s -> 11801.16s]  And I do that shit anyways.
[11801.16s -> 11802.92s]  Like I do it all the time anyways.
[11802.92s -> 11815.34s]  Kind of the whole thing's coming together as the big picture of the future of my life, I guess.
[11815.34s -> 11819.58s]  But thanks everybody.
[11819.58s -> 11828.62s]  It's impossible to be in a position like this without having all of you kind of hold up the earth.
[11828.62s -> 11829.58s]  So I really appreciate it.
[11829.58s -> 11835.40s]  Anybody, if you've watched this channel for a minute, an hour, 10 years, came to the channel.
[11835.40s -> 11838.68s]  If you just came to the channel and you said this guy sucks, fuck this guy, you still here.
[11838.68s -> 11839.48s]  So thanks.
[11839.48s -> 11843.24s]  Thanks for hanging out, regardless of how you feel.
[11843.24s -> 11849.03s]  I did not ever think that I would be looking at announcements like this.
[11849.03s -> 11850.07s]  But I'm going to step up.
[11850.07s -> 11850.71s]  I'm going to try to.
[11850.71s -> 11851.35s]  We'll see what happens.
[11852.07s -> 11853.11s]  I'm going to put my effort into it.
[11853.11s -> 11855.08s]  So let's go.
[11855.08s -> 11856.76s]  The German employed arc.
[11857.32s -> 11857.96s]  That's right.
[11857.96s -> 11860.70s]  That's true.
[11860.70s -> 11869.62s]  Actually employed now.
[11869.62s -> 11871.62s]  But yeah, thanks a lot, everybody.
[11871.62s -> 11872.86s]  I'll see you guys soon.
[11872.86s -> 11881.74s]  Next stream will probably be I want to say maybe like Wednesday or Thursday.
[11881.74s -> 11883.26s]  Let's shoot for Wednesday.
[11883.26s -> 11889.10s]  I do want to play the zoom beanies.
[11889.10s -> 11890.46s]  No, you're not Thursday.
[11890.46s -> 11891.50s]  Make it Thursday.
[11891.50s -> 11894.71s]  We'll do Thursday and like Saturday this week.
[11894.71s -> 11899.66s]  Same time.
[11899.66s -> 11904.41s]  Yeah, like four o'clock, four Pacific.
[11904.41s -> 11908.47s]  We are definitely going to get sick of the zoom beanies in probably an hour and a half.
[11908.47s -> 11909.91s]  So there'll be something else to do too.
[11909.91s -> 11914.97s]  The draft tweet.
[11914.97s -> 11916.01s]  I'll go over the draft tweet.
[11916.57s -> 11920.58s]  When we stream next, tell me to go over the draft tweet.
[11920.58s -> 11922.42s]  And then sorceries will be right after that.
[11922.42s -> 11928.20s]  Thank you again, Square Enix.
[11928.20s -> 11929.40s]  Thanks for watching.
[11929.40s -> 11931.18s]  I had a really great time.
[11931.18s -> 11938.87s]  Looking forward to playing it.
[11938.87s -> 11939.83s]  Have a great night.
[11939.83s -> 11947.93s]  He's choking up.
[11947.93s -> 11948.97s]  No, I'm just burping.
[11948.97s -> 11950.94s]  It's a small difference.
[11962.38s -> 11967.80s]  When are you going to do the tuba stream?
[11967.80s -> 11973.56s]  I probably said I probably said that at some point.
[11973.56s -> 11982.79s]  So burping is choking up.
[11982.79s -> 11983.27s]  Yeah.
[11983.27s -> 11993.03s]  What about infomercial streams?
[11993.03s -> 11998.22s]  Well, the follow up to the off brand stuff obviously is I made this comment a few times
[11998.22s -> 12007.06s]  back in January, February, but we're going to be just doing whatever.
[12007.06s -> 12011.66s]  I'm not going to have essentially I kind of want to take some of the pressure away.
[12014.15s -> 12018.15s]  I got to figure out something to stream every day or every other day, whatever.
[12019.78s -> 12025.45s]  And I think it's probably more fun to just like load up infomercials
[12025.45s -> 12028.73s]  and just watch for a couple hours and hang out.
[12028.73s -> 12033.13s]  Play something like Final Fantasy 16 and not be like, okay, well, I'm not going to do that again.
[12034.95s -> 12039.69s]  You're going to see you will see a lot more of that like you already have.
[12039.69s -> 12041.29s]  Yeah, I'm not stressing it.
[12041.29s -> 12055.46s]  Can we do a Street Fighter 6 training arc stream?
[12055.46s -> 12057.02s]  Maybe.
[12057.02s -> 12058.92s]  Just do what you want.
[12058.92s -> 12062.26s]  Yeah, don't worry.
[12064.14s -> 12064.94s]  I'm still in.
[12064.94s -> 12065.50s]  I'm still in.
[12068.55s -> 12071.48s]  Don't take the off brand announcement that I'm out.
[12071.48s -> 12082.06s]  I'm still in.
[12082.06s -> 12082.94s]  You do you.
[12085.67s -> 12087.67s]  He hates streaming.
[12087.67s -> 12099.90s]  But yeah, will there be less streams over the course of the next however long period?
[12099.90s -> 12102.55s]  Yeah, I got to be honest with you.
[12102.55s -> 12104.33s]  Probably.
[12104.33s -> 12107.45s]  I imagine there probably would be periods where there's a lot going on
[12107.45s -> 12109.93s]  and there's a lot of stuff that I'm trying to do that I'm working on.
[12109.93s -> 12114.82s]  But I'll come back.
[12114.82s -> 12116.18s]  He's not denying it.
[12116.18s -> 12119.53s]  Well, it's not going to be zero streams.
[12119.53s -> 12124.47s]  I'm just saying that when a project is being worked on,
[12124.47s -> 12129.67s]  I'll probably just be back in a couple weeks just like it always is.
[12129.67s -> 12134.01s]  It's a big change.
[12134.01s -> 12134.65s]  You'll get used to it.
[12134.65s -> 12136.17s]  Yeah, I mean, it is a big change.
[12136.17s -> 12141.40s]  This is probably the biggest change in my personal life and work life.
[12141.40s -> 12144.50s]  For it's been 12 years.
[12144.50s -> 12145.46s]  Started doing YouTube.
[12145.46s -> 12148.55s]  I just kind of got a following on YouTube and I was like,
[12148.55s -> 12151.14s]  oh, wait, I can make money doing this.
[12151.14s -> 12152.10s]  That's weird.
[12152.10s -> 12154.94s]  That seems like fucking impossible.
[12154.94s -> 12159.40s]  And then I just kind of honestly the Twitch moving to Twitch
[12159.40s -> 12160.84s]  was probably the other one.
[12160.84s -> 12165.14s]  It's going to be a lot to get used to.
[12165.14s -> 12171.19s]  I know it will be, but we'll just take it as it comes.
[12171.19s -> 12172.47s]  I'm not going anywhere.
[12172.47s -> 12175.77s]  See you guys later.
[12175.77s -> 12176.73s]  See you on Thursday.
[12176.73s -> 12177.45s]  Have a great night.
[12177.45s -> 12178.09s]  Thanks for watching.
[12178.09s -> 12179.77s]  Thanks for sticking around during the sponsor segment.
[12183.16s -> 12184.12s]  See you on Thursday.
[12184.76s -> 12191.77s]  The future is bright.
[12192.89s -> 12194.33s]  I'll see you really soon.
[12194.33s -> 12218.86s]  Call your mother.
