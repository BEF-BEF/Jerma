[0.31s -> 15.38s]  Hey, what's going on guys? It's Jerma. I want to show you something. I want to show you something.
[15.38s -> 18.38s]  We can't do this at the same time. This is a walk-in bath.
[18.38s -> 22.38s]  Alright, so you just film. This is all I want. I just want the walk-in bath button.
[22.38s -> 26.38s]  Hey, what's going on guys? It's Jerma here. We're in the hotel room right now. Orbe's behind the camera.
[26.38s -> 29.38s]  Hello. I just want to show you something.
[29.38s -> 33.38s]  You ever had a goddamn walk-in bath before?
[33.38s -> 36.38s]  This is a walk-in bath. This place is fancy.
[36.38s -> 37.38s]  It's fancy.
[37.38s -> 41.38s]  I've never stayed in a hotel where there was a walk-in bath. Ever.
[41.38s -> 43.38s]  Have you ever stayed in a hotel where there was a walk-in bath?
[43.38s -> 44.38s]  Actually, I have.
[44.38s -> 48.38s]  This is awesome. I feel like I'm in like heaven.
[48.38s -> 56.38s]  One thing that's really important about my channel, we got to show the coffee maker that's in the hotel room. Look at this, baby.
[56.38s -> 64.38s]  Oh yeah. That's like single cup coffee. I don't know if this is like gross. Wait, if I touch this, is it going to charge to my account?
[66.69s -> 68.69s]  Picked up in room 600.
[68.69s -> 77.50s]  Look at this. This is Boston. Look at all these cars. People are going places. People are coming places. Where are these people going?
[77.50s -> 81.74s]  Well, that's a delivery truck, so he's delivering something, apparently.
[81.74s -> 84.74s]  When you're seeing this, it'll probably be Saturday, I'm thinking, I'm assuming.
[84.74s -> 91.74s]  Or if you're coming to my channel and you just like got here like yesterday and you just subscribed, this is when we were at PAX East.
[91.74s -> 93.74s]  That really is true. Hold on, I got to get this.
[93.74s -> 94.74s]  It's snowing badly.
[94.74s -> 95.74s]  This is, all right, hold on.
[95.74s -> 96.74s]  They're huge.
[96.74s -> 101.74s]  All right, guys, right now it's snowing. The snowflakes are so huge, it looks like paper.
[101.74s -> 105.74s]  Like, ready, look at this. It looks like pieces of paper. Can we get like a good shot of this?
[105.74s -> 111.50s]  Come on, come on. Give me a good one. Give me a good one. They're like pieces of paper. Look at that. Look at that. Look at how big that is.
[111.50s -> 115.50s]  Do you see that? Can you believe it? I can't believe it.
[115.50s -> 123.80s]  What time is it right now? Saturday morning, day two, PAX.
[123.80s -> 125.80s]  Solo POV.
[125.80s -> 135.87s]  I'm stretching with my leg. I forgot I was wearing these. Look at these. I look like I'm 75 years old.
[135.87s -> 143.87s]  Oh, it's just grandpa. Grandpa decided to come to PAX today and I go, oh baby, that's a tough walk right there.
[143.87s -> 149.25s]  What the fuck?
[149.25s -> 151.25s]  Oh my God, star pass out from all the drinking.
[151.25s -> 154.38s]  I haven't been in a minute.
[154.38s -> 156.38s]  We found him at Four Prostitutes.
[156.38s -> 157.38s]  He's running in his dream.
[157.38s -> 160.38s]  Oh wow, he's looking. Don't wake him up. He's like running.
[160.38s -> 165.25s]  It looks like you don't have any arms.
[165.25s -> 168.25s]  Yeah, it looks like you.
[168.25s -> 170.25s]  You're a fish.
[170.25s -> 174.56s]  Oh shit.
[174.56s -> 177.80s]  Oh my God. He's going to die.
[177.80s -> 183.54s]  Don't forget arms shut up.
[183.54s -> 186.54s]  And work in it, eh?
[186.54s -> 188.54s]  Don't forget arms.
[188.54s -> 191.03s]  Let me show you the time right now, guys.
[191.03s -> 195.34s]  Right now, it is five after ten.
[195.34s -> 198.34s]  Hey, I'm doing a Facebook update.
[198.34s -> 203.34s]  It's five after ten and Orb is still sitting here like talking to people.
[203.34s -> 207.34s]  So, wait, doesn't Facebook deserve an update on what's going on?
[207.34s -> 211.34s]  You could just do it on your telephone. Oh, that's right, you're from Schweden.
[211.34s -> 216.34s]  You can't like do that up here. You're from friggin' Schweden.
[216.34s -> 219.34s]  Don't forget our meat app.
[219.34s -> 223.34s]  He's also in his underwear, look.
[223.34s -> 227.34s]  I want to see the blizzard conference. We only got like 20 minutes.
[227.34s -> 229.34s]  Let's go.
[229.34s -> 232.34s]  Oh, real life argument on camera.
[232.34s -> 284.59s]  So right now, we are en route to Dave's Bar and Grill and get smashed into like a telephone pole.
[284.59s -> 287.59s]  We're going to Dave's Cheetos Bar and Grill.
[287.59s -> 302.70s]  Get on my level.
[302.70s -> 305.70s]  There's the other person who's recording. It's like, screw you for recording.
[305.70s -> 306.70s]  It really is true.
[306.70s -> 308.70s]  Let's ruin it.
[308.70s -> 312.70s]  We're really going. We're going to Burger Boy's having a party.
[312.70s -> 315.70s]  We're actually walking down the street to his house.
[315.70s -> 319.70s]  And Chicken Fingers actually said that we get free VIP beers.
[319.70s -> 329.74s]  We only get one and it's like the cheapest dog shit beer you can drink.
[329.74s -> 331.74s]  Can you hold this?
[331.74s -> 333.74s]  Can you hold this?
[333.74s -> 367.72s]  This is my love for dream running.
[367.72s -> 369.72s]  I'm playing copyright infringement.
