[4.02s -> 17.94s]  Relax. What? No, I don't want you to see, like, I don't want you to see my, like, pores. Yeah, I know, I know.
[18.50s -> 47.94s]  Screen cam, screen cam, he's gonna sit. I'm a per- I'm a human being, okay? I'm just a fucking emote. How did I even do this?
[49.30s -> 51.30s]  Let's get it stretched out.
[51.78s -> 62.41s]  Is it still stre- it is a little stretched out.
[63.29s -> 74.02s]  Right there, right?
[74.02s -> 75.54s]  Right there? That-
[75.54s -> 83.66s]  That works. Okay. Look like fucking Adam Driver. Yeah, well, he's a handsome guy, so we do that guy give a shit.
[84.78s -> 86.95s]  That's like a handsome- that's a handsome guy.
[90.15s -> 97.18s]  All right. Uh, this is community- I gotta change. Hold on, get off. I don't want to be on camera. I'm never going on camera again.
[97.98s -> 99.98s]  Let me change the, uh, title.
[101.18s -> 102.46s]  To...
[102.46s -> 109.32s]  Uh, this is not gonna take that long because it's a lot less than it was last time. We're just catching up to...
[110.04s -> 112.04s]  This is as of...
[112.60s -> 115.96s]  Of last week? So as of, like, this past week.
[118.07s -> 120.23s]  So from, like, the 18th or something.
[121.19s -> 123.19s]  Or, like, the 19th, whatever it was.
[123.91s -> 128.22s]  Just for us to catch up on all the stuff that we missed. Adam Driver is ugly.
[129.18s -> 139.54s]  Okay, and- and- oh, and- and- and- and- and now you're gonna tell me- and- and Brad Pitt is fucking ugly, too, apparently, huh?
[140.90s -> 148.12s]  You know, I can- I could have an opinion about somebody's that I- that- that's completely an unpopular opinion.
[149.32s -> 153.96s]  Except I actually- I do think that Brad Pitt is very handsome.
[154.92s -> 161.50s]  Uh, community.
[161.50s -> 163.10s]  Content.
[163.10s -> 167.90s]  Uh, snippets. Because this is not gonna be as long. Community content snippets.
[168.54s -> 181.45s]  It's a bad name. Community content snacks.
[182.17s -> 184.17s]  Oh, that doesn't make any sense.
[184.33s -> 189.40s]  Community con- just community content. Nah, you- whatever. Who cares?
[190.28s -> 194.06s]  That's what we're doing.
[194.06s -> 200.33s]  So as you see, we're- we're on the art section.
[201.90s -> 206.31s]  Art. There is a ton of art.
[209.27s -> 213.27s]  Art is actually one of the things that is the most, uh, submitted.
[214.23s -> 221.02s]  That's why we- we have so many- we have so many talented artists here that put up a ton of awesome shit.
[221.74s -> 224.38s]  But there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of art submissions.
[226.23s -> 227.51s]  There's a lot.
[227.51s -> 229.51s]  You guys- you guys do
[229.91s -> 232.14s]  a lot of this shit, and it's great.
[232.14s -> 233.42s]  I'm back.
[233.42s -> 235.50s]  All right, we got a giant rat.
[235.50s -> 239.50s]  Uh, no watermark though, but I don't know whoever it was. I'm too big. I gotta- cause I'm like, huge.
[240.54s -> 248.07s]  Put on some music?
[248.07s -> 255.70s]  Yeah, what we got? Uh, we have Skype hang up sound. That's not really good OST. Skype OST.
[257.06s -> 263.30s]  Oh, yeah, let's take a break. Right. We didn't- we can take a pee break. Right. That's probably gonna-
[263.30s -> 265.30s]  Yeah, I have to go to the bathroom. You're right.
[265.86s -> 425.08s]  I'll get some songs. We'll go take a piss break. Be right back. Hi guys.
[426.12s -> 431.30s]  All right, what about- what should we do for music?
[432.34s -> 434.78s]  How about
[436.26s -> 439.75s]  something chill?
[439.75s -> 441.75s]  Not doom, not doom, not doom.
[442.31s -> 444.55s]  Do I like okra? A vegetable?
[445.27s -> 447.27s]  The fried okra is awesome. Yeah.
[448.90s -> 453.96s]  Odd question, but yeah.
[453.96s -> 455.96s]  Uh, Animal Crossing. Yeah, that's a good-
[459.90s -> 461.26s]  Which one though?
[461.26s -> 464.46s]  Three hours of relaxing and beautiful Animal Crossing music.
[467.34s -> 479.61s]  When's a new one coming out? Isn't there one coming up with Switch? Eventually? March? Holy shit, really?
[482.78s -> 484.78s]  All right, let's do some artwork.
[486.22s -> 488.46s]  So we have- it's a giant rat we saw for a little bit.
[489.34s -> 491.02s]  Thank you, whoever this was.
[491.02s -> 493.30s]  Good shit.
[493.30s -> 495.06s]  We have, uh,
[495.06s -> 496.82s]  me as the king.
[496.82s -> 501.62s]  LOL boomer king.
[501.62s -> 504.57s]  Thanks for the watermark. This is really well done.
[506.73s -> 509.21s]  Hey, we both rule. We both rule together.
[510.09s -> 514.04s]  It's important.
[514.04s -> 517.08s]  Boomer king. What's boomer king? I don't get it.
[522.63s -> 527.83s]  Me. Yeah, but I don't get it. What is a boomer king? Am I the king of all old people? I don't understand.
[528.87s -> 534.92s]  That's a restaurant.
[534.92s -> 536.36s]  Oh, okay. I get it.
[536.36s -> 538.76s]  I mean, I- I still don't. I'm 34.
[539.70s -> 541.70s]  I still am trying to catch on to that.
[546.30s -> 549.98s]  If you don't get it, then that means you're a boomer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is awesome. Thank you.
[551.26s -> 552.62s]  Good shit.
[552.62s -> 555.98s]  This one's wild.
[555.98s -> 557.98s]  This one is fireman here.
[558.62s -> 562.50s]  I like this down here.
[562.50s -> 563.70s]  Hey!
[563.70s -> 570.57s]  My- my- one of my seven shirts I wear.
[573.08s -> 580.15s]  Cute little fireman in the middle. You're gonna be flashed.
[580.87s -> 586.82s]  Not in that way that you're thinking.
[586.82s -> 588.60s]  You got the teeth right.
[588.60s -> 593.37s]  Got the teeth right.
[593.37s -> 595.96s]  I love it.
[595.96s -> 597.96s]  SCP-985.
[599.08s -> 602.20s]  Very- very toothy. He's a very toothy guy.
[604.95s -> 606.95s]  Rat down here, too. That's cool.
[607.70s -> 611.38s]  Is there a watermark that I'm missing? Ooh, this is fucking high fidelity.
[614.20s -> 617.27s]  Oh, right here. There it is. Good shit.
[619.13s -> 620.97s]  This one's really cute. Yeah.
[620.97s -> 622.44s]  It is.
[622.44s -> 624.44s]  This one on the other hand, uh,
[628.79s -> 631.26s]  referencing jump king.
[631.26s -> 641.24s]  But I don't- I'm never gonna get this shit. I'm never gonna understand what this is.
[643.59s -> 650.10s]  This is horrible.
[650.10s -> 653.46s]  Fuck the king FTK. That's coming back fairly soon, by the way.
[655.05s -> 657.05s]  We have some new rules implemented.
[658.01s -> 660.01s]  And the new FTK server
[660.81s -> 662.33s]  is gonna be-
[662.33s -> 669.54s]  Uh, it's not ready yet, but we took all that data from the last mess of a stream with the thousands of people connecting.
[670.34s -> 672.18s]  And we got it down for real.
[672.26s -> 674.42s]  Uh, there's gonna be a lot of fun stuff to do on that server.
[675.38s -> 677.48s]  Soon.
[677.48s -> 679.61s]  Soon, soon, soon.
[679.61s -> 681.45s]  Fuck the king.
[681.45s -> 685.61s]  Uh, this is a pretty good, uh, and this is a pretty good depiction of what happened on that stream.
[687.30s -> 692.50s]  Uh, chat was just freaking the fuck out because nobody could do anything and nobody could eat and I was just killing people.
[694.06s -> 696.36s]  Um, surrounded by
[696.44s -> 698.44s]  mods and devs that can fly around.
[701.18s -> 702.86s]  So yeah, I-
[702.86s -> 706.14s]  We took the criticism. Don't worry. We're implementing a lot of changes.
[706.94s -> 709.18s]  That's a Spongebob movie?
[712.39s -> 717.51s]  This is great. FTK will be coming back soon.
[718.23s -> 721.29s]  Soon, soon, soon.
[721.29s -> 723.29s]  Oh, right. We have, um,
[723.53s -> 725.53s]  we have these uh, the new
[727.05s -> 730.65s]  Soul Calibur VI created characters. Let's actually get close to this.
[731.77s -> 744.92s]  I can just do that. So these are new Soul Calibur characters.
[746.38s -> 750.14s]  Here's, uh, by the resident Soul Calibur VI character creator.
[750.94s -> 755.96s]  Dick Dastardly Richard. This is good. Uh, here's Bugleberry.
[758.66s -> 760.66s]  Everybody's favorite character.
[762.23s -> 764.23s]  Some of these are really fucking good, by the way.
[764.79s -> 766.79s]  Look at this one. This is the J.
[766.87s -> 772.95s]  The J. Janitor. I don't even know how you do this.
[775.74s -> 777.10s]  It's perfect, though.
[777.10s -> 785.34s]  Here's, uh, Dr. Schmeichsen. A good doctor.
[787.11s -> 789.11s]  Is this music not loud enough?
[790.15s -> 794.62s]  You guys know? Oh, there you go. It's Ivy.
[795.50s -> 798.63s]  Look at this one. This is a Jupiter.
[802.58s -> 804.58s]  This one's scary because
[804.90s -> 809.58s]  it's just, it's the same idea with making characters in the wrestling games.
[810.60s -> 816.57s]  You just have to make this gigantic torso human and it's scary.
[818.47s -> 821.19s]  Uh, here's King Germa from the FTK stream.
[821.91s -> 829.13s]  Pretty accurate. I don't know who any of these fighters are, but still.
[830.02s -> 831.78s]  Uh, here's the Joker.
[831.78s -> 838.41s]  Or the, the Germa Joker. Everybody always makes me the Joker. I don't get it.
[838.41s -> 840.41s]  I told you I'm more of a Riddler than I am Joker.
[841.72s -> 844.52s]  Make me as the Riddler and stuff. That's like what I want. That's what I like.
[845.24s -> 848.62s]  Oh, there's Grill Master. Why is he huge?
[849.18s -> 857.06s]  Why is he like seven feet tall? He's stacked. Does it? That's not accurate.
[857.62s -> 865.14s]  There's the Grady Grinner. He's got those barbecue shoes on.
[867.80s -> 868.84s]  Huge Santa.
[869.56s -> 880.26s]  Germario? What is, who's, what is Germario?
[880.26s -> 881.86s]  Just me, but Mario.
[884.44s -> 887.24s]  Dr. Germario? Why, what?
[887.96s -> 891.48s]  Oh, it's the mustache hair. Okay, I get it.
[896.10s -> 898.74s]  I didn't know what this was until right now.
[899.61s -> 901.93s]  This character is, wait, what?
[903.67s -> 905.99s]  The subsound from the Hearthstone card.
[912.63s -> 914.23s]  Holy shit, that's, that's a reference.
[916.98s -> 919.14s]  It's Monk, Monka S.
[924.70s -> 926.22s]  Oh, here's the wine guy.
[928.86s -> 935.19s]  Here is the Trine Wizard. Trine Wizard?
[937.86s -> 940.42s]  He killed my, what is this?
[943.90s -> 945.58s]  Character name, he killed my what?
[946.22s -> 949.86s]  He killed my mom.
[951.35s -> 954.39s]  My father was fairly well. Oh, that, right.
[954.39s -> 956.15s]  Here's Parappa the Rapper.
[958.41s -> 959.29s]  This one's awesome.
[960.94s -> 963.42s]  You gotta take this in and like fight with Parappa.
[964.06s -> 966.14s]  People would be so like impressed by this one.
[968.33s -> 969.53s]  Here's Gino.
[975.43s -> 976.23s]  How the fuck?
[976.95s -> 978.07s]  Oh, in the name of God.
[979.58s -> 981.26s]  Look, he's in Soul Calibur.
[981.26s -> 982.78s]  Look, he finally got to do something.
[983.42s -> 988.81s]  Instead of collect dust in a box at Square Enix.
[995.62s -> 996.34s]  Frank West.
[997.45s -> 998.89s]  Holy shit, here's the dentist.
[999.61s -> 1001.91s]  Here's the Outer Worlds dentist.
[1002.47s -> 1007.94s]  That's so, it's surprising every time we get a batch of these
[1007.94s -> 1012.89s]  because I would, I wish you could have like 10 people
[1012.89s -> 1014.41s]  fight at the same time in Soul Calibur.
[1014.41s -> 1016.33s]  We would just do one of Rumble there somehow.
[1017.37s -> 1017.93s]  But you can't.
[1019.53s -> 1020.57s]  Here's the Jump King.
[1022.15s -> 1023.75s]  These are, this is awesome. Perfect.
[1024.55s -> 1027.46s]  And he's got the boots, he's got the boots on.
[1029.40s -> 1030.84s]  Soul Calibur Rumble.
[1032.50s -> 1035.14s]  Character name, Brian Johnson.
[1036.34s -> 1044.90s]  Is that, that's the ace, the lead singer from ACDC.
[1047.61s -> 1059.59s]  And here's me, Gnarly62.
[1060.15s -> 1061.43s]  Hope you enjoyed the third batch.
[1061.43s -> 1062.71s]  This may be the final batch
[1062.71s -> 1065.19s]  because a hundred character slots is not enough, I guess.
[1065.91s -> 1066.95s]  This community's wonderful.
[1066.95s -> 1068.39s]  They cook up some seriously amazing stuff.
[1068.39s -> 1070.47s]  Have a great community content night.
[1070.47s -> 1072.25s]  Thank you, Gnarly.
[1072.25s -> 1075.64s]  Again, you, you make some great characters.
[1076.36s -> 1077.50s]  These are great.
[1078.14s -> 1079.18s]  Even if we don't get another one,
[1080.22s -> 1083.42s]  you've done three batches of very, very accurate,
[1083.42s -> 1084.70s]  detailed character stuff.
[1084.70s -> 1085.58s]  So thank you.
[1086.30s -> 1087.02s]  You're awesome.
[1087.02s -> 1094.86s]  I'll get this back to normal.
[1094.86s -> 1098.06s]  Scary, pretty scary stuff.
[1098.06s -> 1106.94s]  Germagreed, Money Machine Germa, yep.
[1107.66s -> 1108.22s]  Looking good.
[1108.86s -> 1111.94s]  The duality of, of Germa, maybe.
[1111.94s -> 1113.14s]  Greed changes a man.
[1115.75s -> 1121.00s]  This one is the Blockbuster 1995 store champion.
[1121.00s -> 1121.40s]  That's me.
[1122.36s -> 1123.40s]  I actually own that.
[1124.04s -> 1127.16s]  I've shown it on stream before.
[1129.45s -> 1131.29s]  That is a legitimate document.
[1131.85s -> 1141.03s]  Is the ornaments on the tree for, for Grill Master?
[1143.67s -> 1145.03s]  There's Grandpa appearing in.
[1146.84s -> 1148.68s]  That's a, that's a very, that's one of those videos
[1148.68s -> 1151.96s]  that's on my main channel from like almost a decade ago now.
[1153.08s -> 1154.68s]  I don't think very many of you guys have watched.
[1156.01s -> 1158.65s]  There's a full Grandpa poetry animation
[1159.21s -> 1160.57s]  on that main channel for Christmas.
[1164.18s -> 1165.94s]  I think, I think a lot of people may have missed that one.
[1168.49s -> 1169.61s]  Main channel.
[1171.06s -> 1172.26s]  Archive channel.
[1172.26s -> 1173.22s]  There you go.
[1173.22s -> 1173.86s]  I fixed it.
[1174.50s -> 1176.34s]  This is good stuff though.
[1177.14s -> 1177.62s]  Down here.
[1178.42s -> 1179.78s]  You can't see because I'm in the way.
[1180.68s -> 1181.48s]  Let's fix that.
[1182.04s -> 1185.38s]  Can you see now?
[1186.18s -> 1188.58s]  No, you can't.
[1189.14s -> 1189.94s]  Can you see it now?
[1190.82s -> 1193.53s]  There you go.
[1193.53s -> 1195.54s]  Thanks a lot for the image.
[1196.26s -> 1197.22s]  It's very, very good work.
[1198.02s -> 1198.58s]  As always.
[1199.46s -> 1201.72s]  Keep moving.
[1202.87s -> 1204.47s]  The incredible frogman.
[1204.47s -> 1207.19s]  Live for one night only in Viva Las Vegas.
[1208.07s -> 1209.27s]  Presto Majesto.
[1212.17s -> 1214.54s]  7 p.m. Friday.
[1215.26s -> 1218.31s]  Wait, isn't today Friday?
[1218.31s -> 1219.91s]  Well, I don't even know what day it is.
[1220.71s -> 1221.80s]  No, it's Sunday.
[1224.57s -> 1225.69s]  Do you mean live?
[1225.69s -> 1227.05s]  Oh, live for one.
[1227.05s -> 1230.01s]  No, live for one night only.
[1230.01s -> 1231.93s]  Live for one night only.
[1232.97s -> 1234.41s]  Let's correct that record there.
[1235.21s -> 1236.78s]  This is cute though.
[1237.50s -> 1239.82s]  Good shit.
[1242.23s -> 1242.63s]  Flip it.
[1243.19s -> 1246.63s]  Oh yeah, this is cool.
[1246.63s -> 1247.51s]  We have some cookies.
[1248.23s -> 1249.93s]  This is cookie number one.
[1250.89s -> 1252.89s]  And then here's cookie number two.
[1253.69s -> 1257.05s]  Here they are.
[1257.61s -> 1265.03s]  You know how hard it is to make cookies that are custom?
[1266.60s -> 1267.80s]  It's actually hard to do.
[1268.52s -> 1270.84s]  It's such a pain in the ass.
[1273.58s -> 1275.26s]  Real human teeth on this?
[1275.26s -> 1276.22s]  I didn't even see that.
[1276.78s -> 1278.65s]  Looks like...
[1279.85s -> 1282.73s]  No, those are cranberry crunchies.
[1284.17s -> 1284.73s]  What are they called?
[1285.37s -> 1287.05s]  Candy cane crunchies.
[1287.05s -> 1289.30s]  This is good though.
[1289.30s -> 1290.76s]  Thank you for these.
[1292.70s -> 1293.26s]  This is Dura.
[1293.26s -> 1294.22s]  This is Thunder.
[1294.86s -> 1297.80s]  I don't know who I'm supposed to be here, but I'm trying.
[1297.80s -> 1303.00s]  Cranberry crunchies.
[1303.00s -> 1303.40s]  Pog.
[1304.46s -> 1304.86s]  Pog?
[1305.90s -> 1306.30s]  I don't know.
[1306.30s -> 1306.62s]  Pog?
[1306.62s -> 1307.02s]  I don't know.
[1307.02s -> 1308.54s]  Should I be Pog into that?
[1309.10s -> 1310.14s]  Is this a legitimate...
[1310.14s -> 1311.02s]  I don't know.
[1311.02s -> 1311.50s]  Let me see.
[1311.50s -> 1312.46s]  Let me see what you guys think.
[1313.82s -> 1314.62s]  Enable Pog.
[1314.62s -> 1314.86s]  No.
[1315.82s -> 1317.18s]  I like seeing it spelled out.
[1317.18s -> 1318.06s]  I don't like seeing.
[1318.06s -> 1319.10s]  I want to see it spelled out.
[1319.98s -> 1321.91s]  To me, it's spelled out.
[1321.91s -> 1323.19s]  It's not an emote.
[1323.19s -> 1324.15s]  It's just you saying it.
[1326.94s -> 1327.42s]  Thunder.
[1328.70s -> 1329.66s]  I'm fine, guys.
[1329.66s -> 1330.06s]  I was.
[1330.06s -> 1330.70s]  I was fine.
[1331.26s -> 1335.46s]  We got a GIF of the planets, which looks good.
[1342.10s -> 1345.27s]  You know, Earth still has a hat on.
[1345.27s -> 1350.34s]  Am I ever going to take the hat off?
[1353.46s -> 1355.06s]  This is really good, Delia.
[1355.06s -> 1359.00s]  I wonder if I should ever take the hat off.
[1360.39s -> 1361.19s]  No, please.
[1361.19s -> 1361.83s]  You better not.
[1361.83s -> 1366.95s]  He went on vacation three years ago, and he's still wearing his vacation hat.
[1367.51s -> 1369.64s]  You know what?
[1369.64s -> 1376.04s]  I got into this idea that my emotes were going to be sentient things that did stuff.
[1376.94s -> 1380.30s]  And every six months or so, they would all change because they all did something.
[1380.86s -> 1384.94s]  And then I did it once with Earth and never did it ever again, and he never took it off.
[1385.50s -> 1391.30s]  Like, the sun would go somewhere cold and it would get, like, chilly or something.
[1391.94s -> 1392.82s]  I don't know.
[1392.82s -> 1395.21s]  And then I got lazy and never did it ever again.
[1396.25s -> 1398.18s]  But at least one of them did something fun.
[1401.56s -> 1402.84s]  This is during the Jump King stream.
[1402.84s -> 1404.84s]  This is supposed to be you guys, I don't know, comforting me.
[1405.72s -> 1406.97s]  That was a hard game.
[1407.69s -> 1411.59s]  Earth had a really good time.
[1412.31s -> 1416.26s]  I love it's on this old-ass TV, too.
[1416.90s -> 1429.66s]  Put a scarf on Venus.
[1431.69s -> 1436.38s]  Look at this dude.
[1436.38s -> 1437.10s]  Let's get up close.
[1438.58s -> 1438.98s]  Dermba.
[1438.98s -> 1440.74s]  It's Alex, Kim, Otto.
[1440.74s -> 1443.98s]  Who loves Fireman?
[1446.02s -> 1452.26s]  Fireman is just, it's just everything, it's just the energy that Fireman gives off.
[1452.90s -> 1455.59s]  It's just what, it's how I want to live every day.
[1456.23s -> 1457.40s]  You know what I mean?
[1458.28s -> 1462.33s]  Oh, no PP.
[1463.05s -> 1466.02s]  It's Alex and Otto don't have a PP.
[1466.90s -> 1467.62s]  What?
[1467.62s -> 1472.15s]  Paul Don.
[1472.95s -> 1476.15s]  PP like the fucking mana, I know.
[1477.58s -> 1478.46s]  Nancy Drew.
[1478.46s -> 1479.66s]  Drew Crew, where you at?
[1479.66s -> 1480.70s]  I know you're in here somewhere.
[1481.69s -> 1482.65s]  No, no, no, don't worry.
[1482.65s -> 1485.61s]  I don't have to say, they'll make themselves known very quickly.
[1485.61s -> 1487.37s]  I don't have to, do I really have to say anything?
[1491.34s -> 1493.42s]  Hey, how can you tell if somebody's in the Drew Crew?
[1494.47s -> 1496.15s]  Oh, don't worry, they'll tell you.
[1496.15s -> 1505.19s]  That was long and loud.
[1505.19s -> 1508.04s]  There are dozens of us.
[1515.74s -> 1517.34s]  All 30 of them.
[1517.34s -> 1523.18s]  This is funny though, thank you.
[1524.14s -> 1526.70s]  We got this boomer, let us handle it.
[1526.70s -> 1527.90s]  Twitch plays Dermba.
[1534.84s -> 1536.68s]  I thought these were sweat stains for a second.
[1536.68s -> 1537.32s]  I was like, yep.
[1542.23s -> 1542.79s]  Wait, they are.
[1543.74s -> 1544.38s]  Oh, they are.
[1545.50s -> 1547.58s]  They are actually, it's sweat.
[1547.58s -> 1549.42s]  It's just these gross, sweaty stains.
[1549.42s -> 1549.90s]  All right, cool.
[1550.54s -> 1552.22s]  Nice work.
[1553.59s -> 1554.39s]  That's very clever.
[1556.82s -> 1557.78s]  False start.
[1558.90s -> 1559.70s]  Look at this dude.
[1563.37s -> 1564.33s]  We're gross.
[1565.37s -> 1567.64s]  You belong to us, old man.
[1568.68s -> 1573.02s]  Happy New Year 2020.
[1573.02s -> 1573.74s]  This guy's fucked.
[1575.98s -> 1577.74s]  There's the one guy having some drinks.
[1577.74s -> 1578.62s]  That's good, that's all right.
[1578.62s -> 1579.50s]  Just don't go too far.
[1580.14s -> 1580.94s]  Don't drink too much.
[1582.09s -> 1584.17s]  You're in the legal age of alcohol,
[1584.17s -> 1586.09s]  able to divide into your county,
[1586.09s -> 1588.89s]  and you're legally of age to do it.
[1588.89s -> 1590.25s]  Then have some, don't have too much,
[1590.25s -> 1591.77s]  and just be safe and take care of yourself.
[1591.77s -> 1592.65s]  That's it.
[1592.65s -> 1593.53s]  How old is one guy?
[1596.54s -> 1597.10s]  30.
[1597.10s -> 1612.38s]  We have to show them.
[1612.38s -> 1613.50s]  We showed these on stream already.
[1613.50s -> 1614.30s]  What was that?
[1614.30s -> 1615.66s]  We showed these already on stream.
[1615.66s -> 1620.97s]  But this, they're too good to not just have up
[1620.97s -> 1621.77s]  for like a minute.
[1622.57s -> 1624.36s]  And there are a few of these.
[1632.31s -> 1633.51s]  I love these so much.
[1633.51s -> 1634.79s]  This is so fucking stupid.
[1635.75s -> 1645.00s]  This one actually is scary
[1645.00s -> 1648.04s]  because they didn't do any doctoring.
[1648.76s -> 1652.44s]  They just kind of, it looked like a parrot.
[1652.44s -> 1653.72s]  It looked like a parakeet.
[1654.60s -> 1657.77s]  Some kind of fucking bird.
[1663.46s -> 1664.18s]  Silent Hill.
[1665.14s -> 1669.78s]  There's Dr. Schmeichsen.
[1669.78s -> 1670.90s]  I think we've shown this already,
[1670.90s -> 1672.34s]  but it was good enough to show again.
[1672.98s -> 1673.78s]  This was edited.
[1673.78s -> 1675.06s]  I mean, it was.
[1675.78s -> 1678.34s]  That's such a great image.
[1678.34s -> 1683.27s]  That like, what a great guy.
[1684.15s -> 1686.49s]  Everybody loves the doc.
[1686.49s -> 1687.37s]  Dr. Schmeichsen.
[1689.45s -> 1692.25s]  What about clown lady fan art?
[1692.25s -> 1692.89s]  Excuse me.
[1693.78s -> 1695.78s]  You mean Miss Polly Polite?
[1695.78s -> 1699.40s]  Doesn't sound like you're a real fan.
[1699.96s -> 1709.86s]  Happy birthday to whoever's birthday it is.
[1710.42s -> 1713.00s]  This is really cute.
[1713.00s -> 1713.32s]  I like this.
[1714.20s -> 1721.93s]  What kind of cake is that though?
[1721.93s -> 1722.41s]  I wonder.
[1722.41s -> 1729.62s]  I love this one.
[1729.62s -> 1730.68s]  I love it.
[1730.68s -> 1731.64s]  I just love the teeth.
[1732.20s -> 1734.52s]  The little like, the little teeth sticking out.
[1735.74s -> 1736.78s]  It's adorable.
[1736.78s -> 1737.58s]  I love it.
[1737.58s -> 1739.43s]  Fuck you Joel.
[1740.23s -> 1742.55s]  Yeah, this is when I was going to leave without paying.
[1744.74s -> 1745.70s]  Fuck you Joel again.
[1745.70s -> 1747.30s]  Hope you have enough money lol.
[1747.38s -> 1753.99s]  This looks like a movie poster for a Zoomer horror movie.
[1760.52s -> 1761.80s]  The Great Canadian FK Club.
[1761.80s -> 1762.76s]  20 community subs.
[1764.14s -> 1765.50s]  20 community subs.
[1765.50s -> 1765.74s]  You what?
[1765.74s -> 1766.78s]  You gave six earlier too.
[1766.78s -> 1769.08s]  26 community subs, Canadian.
[1769.08s -> 1770.04s]  That's a lot of money.
[1770.04s -> 1770.36s]  Thank you.
[1772.34s -> 1773.70s]  20 community subs.
[1774.65s -> 1778.04s]  From fucking Great Canadian.
[1778.04s -> 1781.30s]  Thanks a lot man.
[1781.30s -> 1784.34s]  Yeah, this would be like a movie called like,
[1784.34s -> 1785.94s]  Don't Download This or something, right?
[1787.08s -> 1789.08s]  I get like infected through like a virus in my computer
[1789.08s -> 1790.28s]  and I turn into a murderer or something.
[1790.28s -> 1790.60s]  I don't know.
[1797.37s -> 1798.73s]  Dude, hype train.
[1798.73s -> 1800.66s]  Jerm, stop talking.
[1807.11s -> 1807.35s]  No!
[1810.58s -> 1812.55s]  Sorry, I couldn't look at that one.
[1812.55s -> 1813.51s]  Teeth posing.
[1814.31s -> 1815.19s]  Teeth posing.
[1815.99s -> 1820.15s]  This is a, this is a real curtain, right?
[1820.15s -> 1823.43s]  From that fucking website that I'm not going to say the name of anymore.
[1823.43s -> 1829.83s]  This would scare the shit out of me all the time.
[1829.83s -> 1832.31s]  I would be, I'd wake up a couple times a week,
[1832.31s -> 1834.87s]  really groggy, open the door to my bathroom and go,
[1834.87s -> 1835.37s]  Ah!
[1836.01s -> 1836.65s]  Gonna kill me?
[1836.65s -> 1837.37s]  No, it's okay.
[1837.37s -> 1844.41s]  It's just that fucking dumb thing I wasted money on.
[1844.57s -> 1846.17s]  The Jerm Lane.
[1846.17s -> 1849.21s]  Oh yeah, this is like a character in some RPG or something.
[1849.21s -> 1849.61s]  I don't know.
[1849.61s -> 1851.61s]  That has like a rat and it looks like me.
[1851.61s -> 1852.49s]  This is real.
[1852.49s -> 1856.71s]  Frequency on common.
[1856.71s -> 1857.43s]  Armor class.
[1857.43s -> 1857.93s]  Move.
[1858.47s -> 1858.95s]  Hip dice.
[1858.95s -> 1859.75s]  One to four points.
[1860.47s -> 1863.11s]  Occasionally getting visions of games to good boys and girls.
[1863.11s -> 1864.47s]  Jerm Lane or Jermy.
[1864.47s -> 1867.11s]  Something that's known as Bain Mejiz.
[1867.67s -> 1869.43s]  Well and elaborate tunnel and den.
[1869.43s -> 1869.91s]  Is this real?
[1869.91s -> 1870.79s]  Somebody fuck this up.
[1870.79s -> 1871.91s]  This is like a joke, right?
[1878.73s -> 1879.69s]  I don't understand.
[1879.69s -> 1882.31s]  Like yeah, somebody, yeah, this has to be fake.
[1882.55s -> 1884.71s]  This is like, it's that fucking, it's that face.
[1884.71s -> 1886.74s]  This is not real.
[1888.15s -> 1889.51s]  There's like a lore with it.
[1889.51s -> 1890.73s]  I don't know.
[1890.73s -> 1892.57s]  I can't tell from the pixelization.
[1892.57s -> 1893.07s]  Hold on.
[1895.45s -> 1898.30s]  This is a lot of info for it to be fake.
[1899.18s -> 1901.91s]  This is a ton, this is like a ton of info for it to be fake.
[1901.91s -> 1907.78s]  Jerm Lane are very fast, moving with scuttling, gay, very quiet.
[1907.78s -> 1909.62s]  And a master's remaining unseen.
[1909.62s -> 1911.78s]  Now where's like the one line that says like,
[1911.78s -> 1913.78s]  Oh and he's like compact and look at me, right?
[1913.78s -> 1914.74s]  This has to be somewhere.
[1915.70s -> 1917.59s]  Can I speak their own tongue?
[1917.59s -> 1920.86s]  And your fans are dedicated.
[1920.86s -> 1922.54s]  No, this is, this is definitely not real.
[1922.54s -> 1923.58s]  They like, look at this.
[1924.14s -> 1924.94s]  I see the editing.
[1925.66s -> 1927.02s]  Look at that.
[1928.30s -> 1928.80s]  Busted.
[1931.46s -> 1932.02s]  Yep.
[1932.02s -> 1933.30s]  Oh, get absolutely busted.
[1935.77s -> 1937.54s]  Look at how different that looks.
[1937.54s -> 1938.26s]  Look at it.
[1938.26s -> 1939.22s]  You didn't smooth it out.
[1940.26s -> 1940.76s]  Busted.
[1944.73s -> 1945.29s]  It is real.
[1948.14s -> 1949.42s]  J-E-P-G artifacts.
[1950.78s -> 1953.34s]  Oh, this is, this is a real character in a game.
[1953.34s -> 1954.70s]  Or in a Dungeons and Dragons thing.
[1955.58s -> 1960.81s]  All right, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1971.48s -> 1973.08s]  They, this, this is not, this is fake.
[1973.56s -> 1977.27s]  This is that, this is the, that's the face has to be edited.
[1980.10s -> 1980.98s]  You know, look at the floor.
[1980.98s -> 1982.02s]  It's not, it doesn't match up.
[1982.92s -> 1983.80s]  It's compression.
[1984.36s -> 1988.90s]  Oh, the face is shopped.
[1989.77s -> 1990.57s]  Yeah, whatever.
[1990.57s -> 1991.69s]  Is that, that's real though?
[1991.69s -> 1993.13s]  That's strange.
[1993.13s -> 2001.78s]  Oh, in motion for 3,000 minutes?
[2006.41s -> 2007.77s]  How is this a book?
[2007.77s -> 2012.01s]  I don't understand the book.
[2012.73s -> 2017.34s]  This is, this, I think the tagline was this,
[2017.34s -> 2019.10s]  fireman got into the makeup cabinet.
[2026.74s -> 2028.18s]  Wink got redeemed.
[2028.18s -> 2028.68s]  All right.
[2038.62s -> 2040.06s]  Look at that, look at that.
[2040.06s -> 2042.44s]  Don't wink over the image.
[2042.44s -> 2045.64s]  Well, I, I, I'm, I'm, I can only be in here.
[2045.64s -> 2047.08s]  I can't be outside of this box.
[2047.80s -> 2049.08s]  I can't go over here.
[2049.08s -> 2049.80s]  I'm stuck in here.
[2051.14s -> 2051.94s]  Full screen?
[2051.94s -> 2052.42s]  I just did.
[2055.03s -> 2056.07s]  Full screen the camera.
[2057.38s -> 2059.06s]  No, that's not part of the deal.
[2059.06s -> 2060.34s]  If you get a wink, you get a wink.
[2060.34s -> 2062.26s]  It doesn't say full screen wink.
[2062.82s -> 2063.62s]  How's it?
[2063.62s -> 2064.12s]  It doesn't.
[2064.74s -> 2075.66s]  Plus like, subscribe for more.
[2075.66s -> 2077.02s]  Plus like if you did.
[2082.28s -> 2083.72s]  All right, these fucking hurt my head.
[2083.72s -> 2084.76s]  I don't want to look at this.
[2085.56s -> 2095.64s]  Is it the smile that does it?
[2096.44s -> 2098.84s]  Is it my like, it has to be right?
[2100.20s -> 2102.84s]  Did people paint my hair green and do the makeup on me?
[2102.84s -> 2103.72s]  Because I go like this.
[2105.72s -> 2107.88s]  And then I got a fucking long ass chin.
[2107.88s -> 2108.38s]  I get it.
[2109.08s -> 2109.56s]  I get it.
[2109.56s -> 2111.00s]  I'm, I'm the Riddler though.
[2111.00s -> 2112.04s]  I'm not the Joker.
[2112.04s -> 2112.84s]  I am the Riddler.
[2114.04s -> 2116.28s]  No, I'm the, I'm not going to say that.
[2116.28s -> 2118.84s]  I'm, I was going to say I was a combination of the penguin and the Riddler.
[2119.40s -> 2121.32s]  That doesn't, I don't want to say those words together.
[2126.14s -> 2128.22s]  But I, I like the peng, like, I don't know.
[2128.22s -> 2129.74s]  Danny DeVito is fucking crazy.
[2131.13s -> 2131.63s]  Too late.
[2144.06s -> 2144.56s]  Scary.
[2145.26s -> 2146.54s]  That's a scary image.
[2146.54s -> 2147.04s]  Otto.
[2149.30s -> 2151.86s]  We've shown this image before, but it's so nice.
[2153.70s -> 2155.54s]  He's so, look at how cute he is.
[2159.99s -> 2161.43s]  Wearing his little jacket too.
[2161.43s -> 2162.31s]  He has this jacket.
[2163.51s -> 2169.58s]  It was exactly what he looks like.
[2172.49s -> 2175.93s]  Uh, the lovely classic sensible haircut germa.
[2177.11s -> 2179.27s]  Whatever this is versus whatever this is.
[2187.67s -> 2189.91s]  Eyes aren't that fucking close together.
[2189.91s -> 2190.41s]  Okay.
[2190.41s -> 2193.45s]  Like, my nose might be that big, but I'm not.
[2194.33s -> 2199.48s]  This is, this is like the kind of shit like I get.
[2199.48s -> 2199.98s]  Okay.
[2200.52s -> 2204.49s]  This is like a, I opened up like, this is a caricature artist did this.
[2205.47s -> 2208.67s]  And I feel like I'm like, I'm some like a politician or something.
[2208.67s -> 2209.23s]  You know what I mean?
[2209.87s -> 2212.11s]  Like I'm like, this is like a politician caricature.
[2217.79s -> 2245.08s]  That's like, I got fucking more hair than that.
[2246.04s -> 2248.35s]  I got more hair than that.
[2248.99s -> 2250.03s]  I got more hair than that.
[2250.83s -> 2252.57s]  That's funny though.
[2252.57s -> 2253.85s]  That's actually pretty good work too.
[2254.65s -> 2255.61s]  Who is this supposed to be?
[2256.33s -> 2257.13s]  Is this supposed to be me?
[2260.92s -> 2262.84s]  No, I'll tell you what this is.
[2263.56s -> 2272.68s]  The lovely classic sensible 26 year old Jeremy versus what happens when you get to 35.
[2274.04s -> 2275.64s]  There's aging.
[2275.64s -> 2278.76s]  People get older and they look a little different.
[2282.04s -> 2284.28s]  You get older and things change.
[2291.02s -> 2291.74s]  35.
[2291.74s -> 2294.14s]  Yeah, I, you guys already know this shit.
[2294.14s -> 2295.58s]  Do I have to say this out loud over and over?
[2295.58s -> 2297.42s]  I'm turning 35 this year.
[2299.10s -> 2299.90s]  That sucks.
[2301.68s -> 2302.80s]  35.
[2302.80s -> 2305.04s]  It's so, I'm like a hundred.
[2305.84s -> 2310.32s]  I'm not, if you think I'm turning 35, you're fucking crazy.
[2320.48s -> 2326.24s]  This is a German noir and I'm being haunted apparently from my old self.
[2327.04s -> 2334.44s]  I fucking hate this image.
[2334.44s -> 2336.46s]  I hate this image so much.
[2337.26s -> 2341.55s]  Oh, I hate it.
[2341.55s -> 2342.99s]  This is like the worst image ever.
[2343.63s -> 2353.32s]  It just like, it just looks so bad and shitty.
[2353.32s -> 2354.68s]  Not even like funny shitty.
[2354.68s -> 2356.04s]  It just looks bad.
[2356.84s -> 2359.82s]  Sour please broken for anybody else.
[2359.82s -> 2360.38s]  Let's find out.
[2366.52s -> 2367.08s]  No, it works.
[2371.48s -> 2372.76s]  Thank you, Germa.
[2372.76s -> 2379.53s]  Cares makes me happy.
[2379.53s -> 2385.02s]  It's very sweet.
[2387.05s -> 2388.57s]  He's farming sour please.
[2389.45s -> 2392.51s]  How do you farm sour please?
[2392.51s -> 2394.11s]  Just put any, put any song on.
[2394.75s -> 2395.80s]  You'll get it forever.
[2396.44s -> 2403.02s]  He's no friend of mine.
[2403.58s -> 2415.10s]  No, no, I'm talking about that person that's, no, no.
[2415.74s -> 2418.38s]  No, I'm talking about the person that just said that.
[2418.38s -> 2420.46s]  I'm saying, I'm not your friend now.
[2421.18s -> 2423.48s]  Well, you're not invited to my fucking birthday party.
[2423.48s -> 2425.32s]  There's going to be 50,000 people there.
[2430.09s -> 2431.61s]  I love the sleepy rat.
[2431.61s -> 2434.65s]  Relationship with Germa over.
[2436.86s -> 2438.14s]  Who the fuck is your new best friend?
[2439.12s -> 2439.92s]  Who?
[2439.92s -> 2441.42s]  You got to finish that.
[2441.42s -> 2442.62s]  You can't just say the first part.
[2442.62s -> 2443.12s]  Who?
[2445.05s -> 2445.55s]  Joel.
[2449.90s -> 2452.57s]  This is really nice though.
[2452.57s -> 2465.82s]  I'm in 50 years.
[2465.82s -> 2466.94s]  That doesn't even look that bad.
[2467.66s -> 2470.62s]  If I look like this when I'm 60.
[2471.18s -> 2472.30s]  Am I really going to care?
[2472.30s -> 2473.02s]  That looks okay.
[2474.14s -> 2475.26s]  I'll be, that's fine.
[2475.98s -> 2477.50s]  Nice eye.
[2478.22s -> 2482.43s]  This is not a real image.
[2483.23s -> 2484.75s]  People, oh wow, dude.
[2484.75s -> 2485.31s]  Look at your eye.
[2485.31s -> 2486.67s]  Your eye looks like it's fucked up.
[2488.11s -> 2489.47s]  Yeah, this is not a real image.
[2490.43s -> 2491.39s]  What are we, are we dead?
[2495.72s -> 2500.22s]  We're good.
[2500.22s -> 2501.50s]  Just hang tight.
[2501.50s -> 2504.83s]  2020 year of the rat.
[2504.83s -> 2506.14s]  This is true.
[2506.14s -> 2507.18s]  Actually is year of the rat.
[2512.41s -> 2512.97s]  A lot of them.
[2515.34s -> 2516.38s]  I like the eyes on this one.
[2517.50s -> 2519.10s]  They're very sheeny, shiny.
[2519.82s -> 2522.70s]  Looks really good.
[2526.52s -> 2528.44s]  We better get a new rat emote this year.
[2529.08s -> 2530.27s]  I mean you kind of have to.
[2531.63s -> 2532.19s]  Eventually.
[2532.19s -> 2533.31s]  Whenever I decide to do it.
[2536.03s -> 2536.75s]  Hopefully soon.
[2537.95s -> 2538.99s]  I'd put this on the wall.
[2539.79s -> 2541.71s]  I gotta have some cool shit on the wall.
[2541.71s -> 2542.35s]  Don't I?
[2542.35s -> 2543.23s]  I gotta have like, I gotta,
[2543.23s -> 2544.75s]  I gotta make like a streamer room.
[2544.75s -> 2545.25s]  Don't I?
[2547.58s -> 2548.30s]  Right?
[2548.30s -> 2549.50s]  I gotta have a streamer room.
[2550.06s -> 2554.25s]  Yeah, I want, I want,
[2554.25s -> 2556.33s]  I want a blue light.
[2556.33s -> 2557.37s]  And a pink light.
[2558.09s -> 2559.29s]  And a red light.
[2559.29s -> 2560.17s]  And they just,
[2560.17s -> 2561.53s]  that's how you can tell it's a streamer room.
[2562.81s -> 2565.37s]  I need like a blue light back here.
[2566.17s -> 2571.29s]  Streamer cave, yeah.
[2571.29s -> 2576.54s]  That actually would hurt my head.
[2577.58s -> 2580.30s]  You know, I see a lot of people have lights.
[2581.10s -> 2585.34s]  Like bright orange, purple, pink lights back here.
[2585.34s -> 2586.22s]  Like in their room.
[2586.22s -> 2589.50s]  I feel like it'd be like, it would hurt me.
[2589.50s -> 2591.82s]  It would be like UV raised in my head.
[2591.82s -> 2592.70s]  I wouldn't want to do that.
[2596.14s -> 2596.64s]  What is this?
[2603.10s -> 2603.82s]  Did you go too fast?
[2603.82s -> 2604.38s]  I can't clear it.
[2605.10s -> 2609.40s]  This is actually pretty funny.
[2610.28s -> 2613.21s]  This is pretty funny.
[2614.09s -> 2615.29s]  Yeah, this is funny.
[2615.29s -> 2616.49s]  It's funny.
[2616.49s -> 2618.73s]  Oh, okay, I will, I will allow this one.
[2620.17s -> 2621.05s]  I allow this one.
[2622.09s -> 2630.14s]  It's like, it's, it could be real.
[2630.14s -> 2642.04s]  It's, I feel like, this is like,
[2644.76s -> 2647.90s]  I feel like this is the type of image that you actually have
[2648.46s -> 2650.62s]  when you go so overboard
[2650.62s -> 2652.54s]  and you're trying so hard to like,
[2652.54s -> 2655.26s]  have a good Tinder profile picture
[2655.26s -> 2657.02s]  that it ends up looking like this
[2657.02s -> 2659.58s]  because you've taken a hundred fucking pictures.
[2659.58s -> 2662.36s]  And finally you get this one.
[2662.36s -> 2665.88s]  You're like, you've seen the same image of you
[2665.88s -> 2669.24s]  trying to do a good picture a thousand times.
[2669.24s -> 2672.04s]  And it's like, I guess that's that one.
[2672.04s -> 2675.04s]  And then people scroll through this and like, holy shit.
[2675.04s -> 2685.02s]  Like, why, why is Jerma using Tinder?
[2685.02s -> 2686.14s]  I used to use Tinder.
[2687.02s -> 2689.48s]  I used to use Tinder before Kim.
[2690.12s -> 2690.84s]  You guys knew that.
[2690.84s -> 2692.12s]  I used to talk about it all the time.
[2692.12s -> 2695.00s]  He's talking about like all the fucked up shit that happened.
[2695.64s -> 2696.84s]  You guys don't remember that?
[2696.84s -> 2700.94s]  What do the old viewers do?
[2700.94s -> 2704.06s]  That's how he met Kim.
[2704.06s -> 2705.34s]  I did not meet Kim on Tinder.
[2705.34s -> 2706.30s]  That's not what happened.
[2708.00s -> 2709.76s]  No, I don't have like a story like,
[2709.76s -> 2711.44s]  oh, I super liked her.
[2711.44s -> 2712.64s]  She super liked me back.
[2718.72s -> 2719.76s]  Rats, we're rats.
[2719.76s -> 2720.48s]  We're the rats.
[2720.48s -> 2721.12s]  We pray at night.
[2721.12s -> 2721.76s]  We stalk at night.
[2721.76s -> 2722.32s]  We're the rats.
[2723.04s -> 2724.80s]  I'm the giant rat who makes all the rules.
[2724.80s -> 2726.16s]  These are not even rats.
[2726.16s -> 2727.36s]  These are dogs or something.
[2727.36s -> 2727.84s]  What is this?
[2728.32s -> 2732.32s]  What the fuck is this?
[2732.96s -> 2736.12s]  These are dogs.
[2738.08s -> 2740.16s]  Although I do like this one so much.
[2741.76s -> 2743.20s]  Why can't this animal exist?
[2743.20s -> 2744.24s]  I want one.
[2744.24s -> 2745.20s]  Don't you want one of these?
[2745.84s -> 2753.12s]  10 seconds.
[2753.12s -> 2754.00s]  I want one of those.
[2755.28s -> 2757.04s]  It's a doge.
[2757.04s -> 2760.08s]  I know what it is, but this is not, that's not a doge.
[2760.08s -> 2763.36s]  That's, this is a rat dog gerbil thing.
[2764.08s -> 2768.43s]  The wizard in the boulder.
[2768.43s -> 2769.23s]  What's on the ATM?
[2770.03s -> 2770.99s]  It's me, the wizard.
[2770.99s -> 2773.87s]  I telepathically downloaded my soul into this ATM.
[2773.87s -> 2775.39s]  From AI dungeon.
[2775.39s -> 2779.15s]  Otto is literally a rat dog.
[2779.15s -> 2779.55s]  Yes, I know.
[2779.55s -> 2780.59s]  He's a rat terrier.
[2781.15s -> 2782.03s]  Noxon.
[2782.03s -> 2784.99s]  We've confirmed that with genetic DNA.
[2786.19s -> 2790.49s]  This is good shit though, thank you.
[2792.03s -> 2794.43s]  Oh, the banana milk in the bag.
[2795.47s -> 2797.79s]  What is this?
[2800.52s -> 2801.40s]  What is this?
[2801.40s -> 2808.06s]  Oh, I thought this was liquid.
[2808.62s -> 2810.43s]  I thought this was like Gatorade.
[2810.43s -> 2811.15s]  Oh, that's the bread.
[2811.15s -> 2811.71s]  That's the bread.
[2811.71s -> 2812.19s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2812.19s -> 2815.71s]  You always gotta bring enough bread and cheese and oatmeal and shit.
[2830.78s -> 2832.86s]  This is another picture that I like wish I could delete.
[2834.14s -> 2836.01s]  It's just fucking scary.
[2836.73s -> 2842.72s]  You look like you have encouraged the cowardly dog.
[2843.52s -> 2845.95s]  Was this your Tinder pic?
[2846.83s -> 2847.95s]  No, it wasn't.
[2848.92s -> 2849.16s]  No.
[2853.50s -> 2856.78s]  Okay, I just like laugh internally a little bit.
[2856.78s -> 2858.54s]  Like my chest just kind of popped.
[2860.80s -> 2863.52s]  Imagine this was your profile picture on Tinder.
[2864.57s -> 2865.85s]  You get reported.
[2868.00s -> 2868.72s]  Hey, look at that.
[2870.84s -> 2873.72s]  Okay, add a five and then add a one and then add another one.
[2874.28s -> 2875.08s]  Then you'd be correct.
[2875.96s -> 2879.32s]  Add a five, turn this into a five and then make this, turn this into an eight.
[2882.11s -> 2886.11s]  Now you're basing that on that one image of that white thing and it was a joke.
[2886.99s -> 2888.51s]  Come on, you guys can't take a joke.
[2894.89s -> 2897.45s]  Four, five, four, what?
[2897.45s -> 2901.29s]  Six, and then five, eight, five, eight, whatever.
[2902.33s -> 2904.59s]  Good shit.
[2905.39s -> 2906.19s]  Say the line.
[2906.19s -> 2906.75s]  What line?
[2907.47s -> 2909.79s]  What do you mean line?
[2910.59s -> 2913.08s]  Got the coffee right though.
[2913.64s -> 2916.51s]  I love coffee.
[2916.51s -> 2917.96s]  I'm a big coffee fan.
[2920.32s -> 2921.52s]  I get it from my mother.
[2921.52s -> 2927.18s]  My mother drinks coffee a lot and I drink coffee a lot now too.
[2929.74s -> 2930.30s]  Chicken.
[2930.30s -> 2933.45s]  I actually did buy chicken and I bought Cheetos.
[2934.51s -> 2935.39s]  Yes, say the line.
[2936.03s -> 2937.63s]  Say the line, say the line.
[2937.63s -> 2940.11s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken, everybody.
[2941.63s -> 2943.15s]  This is from PeacefulHaley.
[2943.15s -> 2945.15s]  I was during the FTK stream.
[2945.15s -> 2946.59s]  How did you get it up there?
[2946.59s -> 2947.47s]  How did you even do this?
[2948.35s -> 2949.55s]  How did you get that up there?
[2952.76s -> 2955.80s]  Wait, did you build this and then jump off?
[2959.23s -> 2959.87s]  Afterwards.
[2959.87s -> 2964.14s]  Oh, this is like the crowning achievement.
[2964.14s -> 2965.34s]  And then it was like, I got to get down.
[2967.68s -> 2968.56s]  The scaffolding.
[2968.56s -> 2969.76s]  There's no scaffolding though.
[2969.76s -> 2970.48s]  How did you do this?
[2971.04s -> 2971.84s]  How did you get down?
[2972.48s -> 2974.72s]  You're bad at Minecraft.
[2974.72s -> 2977.58s]  You can't be bad at Minecraft.
[2977.58s -> 2979.84s]  You can't.
[2980.72s -> 2982.00s]  It doesn't, there's no such thing.
[2982.96s -> 2984.48s]  No, you cannot be bad at Minecraft.
[2985.28s -> 2985.68s]  You can't.
[2989.21s -> 2990.65s]  You cannot be bad at Minecraft.
[2992.49s -> 2992.97s]  You can't.
[2993.61s -> 2998.27s]  How can you be bad at Minecraft?
[3002.94s -> 3004.14s]  You forgot to wear armor.
[3004.78s -> 3007.55s]  But that's like saying you're bad at LEGOs.
[3007.55s -> 3009.23s]  You can't, can you be bad at LEGOs?
[3010.03s -> 3013.18s]  Oh, actually, it's like, hold on.
[3013.18s -> 3014.30s]  That's a little different.
[3014.30s -> 3015.74s]  It's like if you were making LEGOs
[3015.74s -> 3017.58s]  and people were trying to like break your door down
[3017.58s -> 3018.62s]  and like kill you.
[3019.66s -> 3020.78s]  Actually, you never mind.
[3021.66s -> 3025.88s]  Like while you're doing LEGOs,
[3025.88s -> 3027.72s]  there's just like monsters outside.
[3028.36s -> 3029.87s]  Oh, yeah.
[3031.07s -> 3032.41s]  Yeah, that's true.
[3032.41s -> 3032.81s]  That's right.
[3033.77s -> 3035.45s]  You can be bad at Minecraft.
[3035.45s -> 3039.05s]  You can't be bad at creative mode.
[3039.45s -> 3040.97s]  You can't die with LEGOs.
[3042.01s -> 3045.13s]  I'm saying Minecraft is sort of just like digital LEGOs,
[3045.69s -> 3047.69s]  but there's monsters trying to kill you.
[3048.33s -> 3049.13s]  So I was wrong.
[3049.13s -> 3050.89s]  I misspoke when I said that LEGOs,
[3050.89s -> 3053.77s]  if you went, if you had, you know, I misspoke.
[3055.29s -> 3056.01s]  It's not.
[3056.01s -> 3056.57s]  How is it not?
[3058.73s -> 3059.29s]  What?
[3059.29s -> 3061.13s]  How is Minecraft not like digital LEGOs?
[3063.02s -> 3064.38s]  You can absolutely die with LEGOs.
[3064.38s -> 3065.34s]  You ever stepped on one?
[3067.76s -> 3068.72s]  Stop stalling.
[3068.72s -> 3069.20s]  You can't.
[3069.20s -> 3069.76s]  You can't.
[3070.32s -> 3078.43s]  You're backtracking now.
[3078.43s -> 3078.93s]  What?
[3081.07s -> 3082.03s]  Hey, look at this dude.
[3083.55s -> 3085.15s]  Literally, my grandpa has said that.
[3086.11s -> 3087.15s]  What did somebody just say?
[3087.15s -> 3090.03s]  Minus two funny Facebook, Instagram humor.
[3092.03s -> 3094.75s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[3096.59s -> 3097.23s]  Oh, really?
[3097.87s -> 3101.28s]  Funny Facebook, Instagram humor.
[3101.92s -> 3103.20s]  I don't have an Instagram,
[3103.20s -> 3108.91s]  and I don't have a Facebook, Instagram humor.
[3108.91s -> 3110.68s]  I don't have a Facebook, Instagram humor.
[3110.68s -> 3112.28s]  I don't have a Facebook, Instagram humor.
[3112.28s -> 3113.96s]  I don't have a Facebook, Instagram humor.
[3113.96s -> 3115.24s]  And I don't have a Facebook.
[3116.44s -> 3119.18s]  So I would just call that shitty humor.
[3119.18s -> 3119.82s]  Get it right.
[3122.88s -> 3123.76s]  Oh, really?
[3128.17s -> 3129.61s]  We struck a nerve on that one.
[3129.61s -> 3130.57s]  I already have a Facebook.
[3131.69s -> 3133.80s]  I don't have a Facebook account.
[3134.84s -> 3137.40s]  I don't have an, well, there is an Instagram account.
[3137.40s -> 3138.04s]  It's not mine.
[3138.60s -> 3140.76s]  Somebody made a fucking fake Instagram account,
[3140.76s -> 3142.60s]  and it's just been there for like 10 years.
[3142.60s -> 3143.48s]  I don't fucking even know.
[3143.48s -> 3144.44s]  I'm not connected to it at all.
[3145.64s -> 3146.44s]  Oh, Cheeto.
[3147.16s -> 3149.71s]  I really like these ones, actually.
[3150.43s -> 3161.93s]  You're licking my, yeah, I posted on there like in 2012.
[3165.13s -> 3166.88s]  Is this paint?
[3166.88s -> 3167.68s]  This is on a canvas.
[3167.68s -> 3172.78s]  This is actually on a canvas, right?
[3172.78s -> 3174.30s]  I mean, it looks, this looks great.
[3175.42s -> 3176.30s]  I love that smile.
[3181.87s -> 3182.83s]  Canvas effect.
[3185.87s -> 3186.43s]  This again?
[3186.43s -> 3187.39s]  What do you mean this again?
[3187.95s -> 3192.08s]  Click the link, click the link, click the link.
[3192.72s -> 3204.88s]  This is when, when chat hears Jerma go on a rant.
[3255.36s -> 3255.84s]  Damn it.
[3257.28s -> 3258.48s]  No, no.
[3260.40s -> 3261.84s]  I'm just going to start talking in like
[3261.84s -> 3263.60s]  fucking nutritional labels.
[3263.60s -> 3264.48s]  I'm not going to talk about,
[3264.48s -> 3266.56s]  I'm not going off on any more like weird,
[3266.56s -> 3268.40s]  like reaching and talking about rant.
[3268.40s -> 3270.48s]  No, I'm just going to read like the nutritional facts
[3270.48s -> 3271.60s]  and that's it.
[3271.60s -> 3272.56s]  No more talking.
[3274.65s -> 3277.88s]  God damn it.
[3277.88s -> 3281.23s]  Oh, dude, Royal Rumble.
[3281.23s -> 3281.87s]  It's tonight?
[3287.84s -> 3288.48s]  Oh my God.
[3288.48s -> 3292.70s]  I'm going to, I'm going to only tell you guys
[3292.70s -> 3295.02s]  fucking jokes like from popsicle sticks from now on.
[3295.66s -> 3297.64s]  This is great though.
[3297.64s -> 3298.12s]  It's beautiful.
[3298.68s -> 3317.26s]  You're a cartoon character.
[3317.26s -> 3322.88s]  I've been called worse.
[3328.75s -> 3330.67s]  Yo dude, I noticed that you're alone.
[3330.67s -> 3331.79s]  Do you need a spot or anything?
[3331.79s -> 3333.23s]  Just talk to me if you need anything.
[3334.11s -> 3342.08s]  This guy's fucking huge.
[3342.72s -> 3346.32s]  The farting is screaming.
[3346.32s -> 3346.82s]  Yeah.
[3347.84s -> 3348.72s]  This dude's focused.
[3349.28s -> 3358.16s]  This is really funny.
[3358.16s -> 3358.66s]  Good work.
[3360.88s -> 3367.16s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[3367.80s -> 3369.24s]  There's nothing wrong with me.
[3369.24s -> 3371.52s]  Okay.
[3378.19s -> 3379.87s]  This is in the background.
[3381.04s -> 3383.44s]  I can't say what this one's called.
[3383.44s -> 3385.04s]  I can't say what this one's called.
[3385.84s -> 3386.80s]  Apologize.
[3386.80s -> 3391.56s]  Doesn't count.
[3391.56s -> 3393.00s]  I don't have to apologize unless I say it.
[3394.65s -> 3401.48s]  This is a fucking E3 awards.
[3401.48s -> 3402.68s]  Nice sound.
[3402.68s -> 3403.24s]  Very good.
[3403.24s -> 3403.72s]  Hmm.
[3403.72s -> 3404.12s]  Yeah.
[3404.12s -> 3404.62s]  Cool.
[3414.62s -> 3415.26s]  Excellent art.
[3415.26s -> 3416.22s]  Yeah, this is good.
[3416.22s -> 3416.94s]  This is really good.
[3417.66s -> 3427.68s]  The streams are always so strange.
[3428.32s -> 3432.96s]  Those E3 streams.
[3433.60s -> 3436.11s]  There's always something wrong with them.
[3439.07s -> 3439.87s]  Look at this.
[3440.83s -> 3443.23s]  Can you fucking even imagine?
[3443.23s -> 3444.43s]  This is a photo.
[3444.43s -> 3445.39s]  This is a photograph.
[3450.48s -> 3451.52s]  Picture of my face.
[3452.08s -> 3460.04s]  Like this.
[3460.04s -> 3461.08s]  That's so well done.
[3461.80s -> 3462.60s]  It's incredible.
[3463.80s -> 3464.60s]  Incredible.
[3471.96s -> 3473.16s]  Nice fucking work.
[3476.70s -> 3479.02s]  Nice Arthus Menethil hair.
[3481.08s -> 3481.58s]  Nice.
[3482.04s -> 3482.76s]  That's a new one.
[3483.32s -> 3486.28s]  That's a new-
[3486.28s -> 3486.84s]  I like that one.
[3486.84s -> 3487.88s]  That's a new one.
[3487.88s -> 3488.38s]  That's cool.
[3489.24s -> 3491.21s]  You guys should say that now.
[3491.93s -> 3492.89s]  Instead of goblin.
[3493.77s -> 3494.89s]  Or peasant hair.
[3495.69s -> 3496.49s]  Or Farquaad.
[3496.49s -> 3497.05s]  I like that one.
[3497.05s -> 3497.85s]  Arthus Menethil.
[3498.57s -> 3499.53s]  That's what it is in canon.
[3500.25s -> 3508.36s]  A fantastic work.
[3508.36s -> 3510.12s]  Let's get in real close.
[3513.95s -> 3515.39s]  You can get like the bump too.
[3515.39s -> 3516.51s]  You got the bump correct.
[3517.15s -> 3519.23s]  Let's look at this.
[3519.87s -> 3521.52s]  It's crazy.
[3522.86s -> 3524.38s]  Some of you guys are so fucking talented.
[3524.38s -> 3525.02s]  It's ridiculous.
[3525.90s -> 3530.40s]  Awesome job.
[3530.40s -> 3537.16s]  I love it.
[3537.16s -> 3538.52s]  There is Drew Carey.
[3540.22s -> 3541.90s]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[3541.90s -> 3542.86s]  Sorry, what I meant to say was
[3542.86s -> 3543.98s]  it's a picture of Nightwing.
[3544.62s -> 3546.33s]  Could be anybody.
[3546.33s -> 3562.19s]  He said some, not all.
[3562.19s -> 3563.15s]  He hates us.
[3563.15s -> 3564.03s]  You're all right.
[3564.03s -> 3566.12s]  What song is playing?
[3566.12s -> 3567.08s]  I have no idea.
[3567.40s -> 3570.48s]  Uh, this is our number.
[3570.48s -> 3572.88s]  This is 51 minutes into the three hours
[3572.88s -> 3574.08s]  of Animal Crossing music.
[3574.08s -> 3574.64s]  I don't know if there's a...
[3576.64s -> 3577.20s]  All right, hold on.
[3578.41s -> 3580.01s]  Uh, this, that song was just called
[3583.00s -> 3583.96s]  New Leaf.
[3583.96s -> 3584.46s]  Wait.
[3586.36s -> 3588.44s]  Okay, that's New Leaf, 7 p.m.
[3589.08s -> 3592.40s]  Yeah, let's hear it twice.
[3592.40s -> 3599.05s]  Look at how just fucked up this is too.
[3599.05s -> 3600.17s]  Look at this image.
[3600.17s -> 3603.00s]  It's like, all right, you started here.
[3603.00s -> 3604.04s]  You're like, all right, let me get
[3604.04s -> 3605.08s]  like a nice clean line.
[3605.08s -> 3607.16s]  And then you're like, at some point
[3607.16s -> 3608.12s]  you're like, fuck it.
[3608.12s -> 3609.32s]  I'm putting the Nightwing symbol
[3609.32s -> 3609.96s]  on Drew Carey.
[3616.09s -> 3616.97s]  Fuck it, Friday.
[3617.53s -> 3619.36s]  I love this though.
[3619.36s -> 3619.84s]  Thank you.
[3619.84s -> 3620.72s]  It's fucking hilarious.
[3621.36s -> 3624.59s]  Uh, is that Omega symbol?
[3624.59s -> 3625.07s]  I don't get it.
[3625.63s -> 3628.49s]  Omega.
[3628.49s -> 3631.61s]  Click this link.
[3631.61s -> 3632.73s]  I will in a minute.
[3632.73s -> 3634.49s]  We're doing community content part two night.
[3635.05s -> 3635.55s]  What is it?
[3643.16s -> 3644.68s]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, we showed
[3644.68s -> 3646.44s]  the credit card already a couple times.
[3647.24s -> 3648.76s]  We already showed the credit card.
[3650.80s -> 3652.48s]  We've shown, we've shown the credit card.
[3653.60s -> 3655.12s]  And it's weird to say that I've shown
[3655.12s -> 3656.80s]  a viewer's credit card on camera.
[3656.80s -> 3658.00s]  You know, that's weird to say that.
[3662.20s -> 3662.76s]  Wrong link.
[3663.77s -> 3664.65s]  Oh shit.
[3664.65s -> 3665.45s]  Oh my God.
[3665.45s -> 3666.25s]  This is all right.
[3666.25s -> 3667.13s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3671.24s -> 3671.88s]  Ready?
[3671.88s -> 3672.44s]  Check this out.
[3673.37s -> 3674.41s]  No, no, spoiler.
[3675.13s -> 3692.28s]  That's insane.
[3693.08s -> 3701.37s]  How long did this take?
[3701.93s -> 3706.01s]  Oh, I didn't even realize it was digital.
[3709.45s -> 3711.77s]  That's even more impressive, right?
[3711.77s -> 3714.38s]  That's insanity.
[3714.38s -> 3717.42s]  I wonder how long that took.
[3717.42s -> 3717.92s]  You here?
[3718.62s -> 3719.34s]  You still here?
[3719.34s -> 3719.82s]  You here?
[3719.82s -> 3720.32s]  Are you here?
[3721.02s -> 3721.98s]  12 hours?
[3722.70s -> 3726.64s]  Flowers.
[3727.10s -> 3731.74s]  Is Apple shift here?
[3733.90s -> 3737.18s]  Oh, that's a Omega fireman.
[3737.18s -> 3738.06s]  Omega fireman.
[3738.70s -> 3739.90s]  Observe the individual.
[3745.15s -> 3746.51s]  Yeah, I didn't know what this was.
[3746.51s -> 3747.79s]  And what do you want me to say?
[3750.11s -> 3751.55s]  I also, you know what?
[3751.55s -> 3752.67s]  It's more embarrassing to not know
[3752.67s -> 3753.55s]  the half-life symbol.
[3754.35s -> 3756.96s]  When you're locked in
[3756.96s -> 3758.88s]  and someone's yelling instructions at you,
[3758.88s -> 3762.14s]  you just forget, forget.
[3762.78s -> 3767.23s]  Another rap?
[3769.39s -> 3770.19s]  Lambda, I know.
[3770.91s -> 3772.65s]  He doesn't know.
[3772.65s -> 3773.53s]  Omega low.
[3773.53s -> 3774.41s]  Blaming Joel.
[3775.37s -> 3777.21s]  No, Joel had really great instructions.
[3778.17s -> 3781.40s]  Those instructions were actually very, very good.
[3781.40s -> 3783.80s]  I think we turned into a solid team there
[3783.80s -> 3785.24s]  and halfway through into the end.
[3785.24s -> 3788.16s]  Cute rap?
[3788.16s -> 3789.60s]  Little tail?
[3790.24s -> 3791.90s]  Speaking of which,
[3792.70s -> 3801.74s]  here's one of the times we played it.
[3804.41s -> 3804.91s]  Think.
[3805.37s -> 3810.57s]  How does Joel get armor?
[3810.57s -> 3812.17s]  I don't have armor.
[3812.17s -> 3818.54s]  I guess I do have armor.
[3818.54s -> 3819.58s]  He's got like, he's got like,
[3820.62s -> 3822.64s]  because he's diffusing.
[3822.64s -> 3823.60s]  I need armor too.
[3826.81s -> 3828.09s]  I want to be in armor.
[3828.09s -> 3828.65s]  Where am I?
[3829.53s -> 3831.23s]  All right, from the way that I see this,
[3831.87s -> 3833.16s]  I guess no, never mind.
[3834.56s -> 3836.16s]  I'm not in the same room, is it?
[3836.16s -> 3837.28s]  Well, I guess I could be sitting there.
[3837.28s -> 3838.48s]  We could both be looking at the bomb.
[3839.20s -> 3840.99s]  So I'm definitely not in the same room.
[3840.99s -> 3841.79s]  So why would I be?
[3841.79s -> 3842.91s]  Yeah, I wouldn't be in armor.
[3842.91s -> 3843.31s]  You're right.
[3844.43s -> 3845.31s]  Leon Kennedy.
[3847.88s -> 3849.64s]  Not strong enough to wear clothes.
[3849.64s -> 3850.14s]  All right.
[3858.04s -> 3859.72s]  I don't know what, I don't know what that means,
[3859.72s -> 3861.40s]  but I'm kind of scared that I just said,
[3861.40s -> 3862.84s]  uh, I don't know what that is.
[3865.29s -> 3866.01s]  Get good.
[3866.01s -> 3866.49s]  Here we go.
[3866.49s -> 3867.61s]  Here's another one.
[3867.61s -> 3869.13s]  Two plus two equals what?
[3869.77s -> 3870.49s]  With the bomb.
[3871.69s -> 3872.65s]  This is really cute.
[3875.76s -> 3877.44s]  It means you eat poop.
[3877.44s -> 3879.47s]  Well, that's hysterical.
[3879.47s -> 3883.45s]  Why doesn't this work?
[3884.25s -> 3885.21s]  I'm going to get that to work.
[3886.83s -> 3889.71s]  The ninja get good ultimate guide to gaming.
[3890.59s -> 3894.22s]  Doesn't he have one of those?
[3895.18s -> 3897.50s]  Does ninja actually have like a game manual?
[3897.50s -> 3898.62s]  How do we go to video games?
[3903.18s -> 3903.68s]  Yes.
[3904.38s -> 3908.09s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[3908.09s -> 3908.59s]  Yes.
[3913.55s -> 3914.05s]  Really?
[3914.59s -> 3920.59s]  I should probably read this.
[3920.59s -> 3921.71s]  Ultra gaming one.
[3922.68s -> 3924.68s]  Ninja get good ultimate gaming.
[3925.40s -> 3928.17s]  This is real.
[3928.17s -> 3932.62s]  Wait a minute.
[3932.62s -> 3938.88s]  What does he say in the book?
[3938.88s -> 3939.96s]  Hold on.
[3939.96s -> 3942.54s]  Get good ultimate.
[3942.54s -> 3948.68s]  Okay.
[3948.68s -> 3949.72s]  How many pages is this?
[3950.28s -> 3952.09s]  Is this more than 20 pages?
[3952.73s -> 3962.08s]  Get good.
[3962.08s -> 3963.60s]  Invest in a gaming mouse.
[3963.60s -> 3965.12s]  What makes a good mouse?
[3965.68s -> 3969.50s]  Get a good mouse.
[3970.22s -> 3974.57s]  Developing game sense.
[3976.96s -> 3978.08s]  My biggest win.
[3980.97s -> 3982.41s]  My biggest win ever?
[3983.37s -> 3988.80s]  Like money?
[3989.76s -> 3996.99s]  Pillars, the four pillars of improvement.
[3996.99s -> 3998.19s]  I can't believe this is real.
[3998.19s -> 3999.07s]  This is wild.
[4005.34s -> 4006.94s]  Imagine a regular win.
[4006.94s -> 4008.06s]  My biggest win ever.
[4012.44s -> 4013.40s]  Read it on stream.
[4014.20s -> 4015.08s]  Make your own book.
[4015.64s -> 4016.58s]  I can't.
[4019.95s -> 4020.75s]  How to lead.
[4021.63s -> 4023.23s]  There's like leadership skills in here.
[4026.27s -> 4028.11s]  Suppressing and covering fire.
[4029.15s -> 4031.47s]  Suppressive fire, sometimes called covering fire,
[4031.47s -> 4033.71s]  is both tactical and psychological.
[4033.71s -> 4035.95s]  Not only does it scare opponents and potentially...
[4036.59s -> 4037.95s]  Is this like a military handbook?
[4041.04s -> 4042.56s]  Team Tactics 101.
[4045.02s -> 4045.98s]  I'm going to read this book.
[4045.98s -> 4047.80s]  I have to.
[4047.96s -> 4049.16s]  It probably won't take me very long.
[4049.16s -> 4050.36s]  I'm going to read that book.
[4050.36s -> 4052.27s]  Remember, you don't need that.
[4052.27s -> 4054.03s]  You beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[4054.03s -> 4055.87s]  Yeah, but I didn't know about suppressing fire.
[4055.87s -> 4056.67s]  I didn't know what that was.
[4059.64s -> 4060.28s]  Covering fire?
[4060.28s -> 4060.92s]  What the fuck is that?
[4066.30s -> 4066.78s]  You beat...
[4067.50s -> 4068.30s]  I can't believe that's real.
[4068.30s -> 4069.50s]  That's fucking crazy.
[4069.50s -> 4070.70s]  Well, good for you, Ninja.
[4072.06s -> 4073.64s]  Got a fucking book.
[4073.64s -> 4075.12s]  I tried to do that once.
[4075.92s -> 4077.88s]  And I wrote like seven pages
[4077.88s -> 4079.48s]  and then gave up because it was too hard.
[4079.48s -> 4081.95s]  So, good on you.
[4082.67s -> 4092.08s]  You beat the Sekiro final boss.
[4097.40s -> 4097.96s]  What is this?
[4097.96s -> 4099.00s]  This is not an ammo crossing.
[4099.56s -> 4099.88s]  Is it?
[4100.52s -> 4104.22s]  facade.
[4110.48s -> 4111.84s]  I don't want to show this on stream
[4111.84s -> 4113.04s]  for more than five seconds.
[4113.04s -> 4113.60s]  All right.
[4113.60s -> 4115.20s]  This is weird and scary and creepy
[4115.20s -> 4116.08s]  and it's a scary face.
[4116.96s -> 4135.90s]  For these, this person posted...
[4135.90s -> 4137.26s]  At first, I wasn't going to include these
[4137.26s -> 4137.66s]  because I was like,
[4137.66s -> 4139.18s]  what the fuck is this person doing?
[4139.18s -> 4140.22s]  There's like three of these.
[4140.22s -> 4141.10s]  They just put this.
[4141.98s -> 4143.50s]  And they say, oh, there was some weird images
[4143.50s -> 4144.22s]  during the green screen.
[4144.22s -> 4146.78s]  But I'm like, all right, what does that have to do with anything?
[4148.32s -> 4149.52s]  And then they did this.
[4150.16s -> 4159.15s]  So I was like, okay, I guess I understand.
[4159.79s -> 4167.96s]  That's a person's face.
[4167.96s -> 4168.68s]  I don't know.
[4175.82s -> 4176.70s]  Don't get too close.
[4177.26s -> 4178.14s]  Don't get too close.
[4179.79s -> 4180.11s]  All right.
[4180.11s -> 4182.59s]  I feel like I've woken up a bunch of times
[4183.39s -> 4186.19s]  and like that's where Otto's face is.
[4186.19s -> 4187.55s]  This is like if you have a dog
[4187.55s -> 4190.43s]  that's like ever been in bed with you
[4190.43s -> 4192.27s]  and you're like snuggling your dog.
[4192.27s -> 4194.35s]  It's just like, oh, there you are.
[4199.16s -> 4200.04s]  I don't know what this is,
[4200.04s -> 4208.17s]  but it's pretty detailed, whatever it is.
[4210.81s -> 4211.61s]  Zoom back out.
[4212.57s -> 4214.03s]  10K.
[4215.23s -> 4216.61s]  10K.
[4217.93s -> 4220.09s]  I don't know if you're referring to.
[4220.09s -> 4220.97s]  Look at that fireman.
[4220.97s -> 4221.85s]  It's a beautiful fireman.
[4221.85s -> 4222.57s]  Beautiful Shido.
[4224.17s -> 4226.25s]  This channel is over 10,000 subs.
[4226.25s -> 4229.56s]  I can tell you the exact number right now.

[4268.84s -> 4270.20s]  And speaking of subs,
[4270.20s -> 4271.72s]  I said the word subs.
[4271.72s -> 4272.52s]  So here we go.
[4273.32s -> 4276.22s]  Thank you, fly for shy for the 10 community subs.
[4276.94s -> 4278.36s]  Appreciate it.
[4278.36s -> 4278.76s]  Thank you.

[4281.55s -> 4283.95s]  There's like 5,000 community subs on the channel.
[4283.95s -> 4284.43s]  Something like that.
[4284.43s -> 4285.31s]  Something fucking crazy.
[4287.80s -> 4288.68s]  Thanks guys.
[4288.68s -> 4291.26s]  Keep going.

[4311.95s -> 4313.39s]  Forced subs.
[4313.39s -> 4315.13s]  What?
[4315.13s -> 4317.29s]  No, community sub means you just get a sub.
[4317.29s -> 4322.25s]  Oh, that's actually...
[4322.25s -> 4322.49s]  Wait a minute.
[4322.49s -> 4322.89s]  Hold on.
[4324.86s -> 4326.54s]  Are these stickers on the notepad?
[4327.50s -> 4327.98s]  Oh, all right.
[4327.98s -> 4328.86s]  That's cool.
[4328.86s -> 4332.67s]  I always have to be...
[4332.67s -> 4333.63s]  I'm always crying.
[4333.63s -> 4334.27s]  I cry a lot.
[4334.27s -> 4336.11s]  If you're a new viewer, I fucking cry all the time.
[4336.67s -> 4341.93s]  I was a for...
[4341.93s -> 4342.41s]  I was...
[4342.41s -> 4343.77s]  I was forced into subbing.
[4344.99s -> 4345.47s]  No, what?
[4345.47s -> 4347.87s]  A community sub just means you got a sub for free.
[4351.00s -> 4351.88s]  Every other stream.
[4351.88s -> 4353.08s]  I don't cry every other stream.
[4353.08s -> 4356.04s]  Only if there's like fucking loud sounds in my ears.
[4356.68s -> 4368.44s]  This is really good art.
[4369.08s -> 4374.44s]  All right.
[4374.44s -> 4377.08s]  We need to talk about like images that will come back to haunt me.
[4378.97s -> 4379.61s]  This is like...
[4379.61s -> 4380.41s]  This is one of them, right?
[4381.95s -> 4382.83s]  This is always here.
[4382.83s -> 4384.27s]  And even when like 10 years from now,
[4384.27s -> 4387.07s]  people will be making like photoshops of this image, right?
[4387.07s -> 4388.43s]  That's kind of how that works.
[4389.07s -> 4392.67s]  You need to make that an emote.
[4394.32s -> 4395.12s]  VenomGermo.

[4398.30s -> 4398.86s]  The hand?
[4399.66s -> 4401.31s]  The hand...
[4401.31s -> 4402.75s]  Wait, the hand is not art?
[4402.75s -> 4403.87s]  It's not like drawn art?
[4405.47s -> 4405.95s]  Wait, is it...
[4405.95s -> 4406.83s]  It's like pumped in?
[4415.39s -> 4416.35s]  Oh, it's still cool though.
[4417.98s -> 4418.54s]  I like this.
[4418.54s -> 4419.98s]  I don't know how you do this type of stuff,
[4421.13s -> 4424.17s]  but like you're watching this on like a TV.
[4424.73s -> 4425.69s]  Like an old...

[4426.25s -> 4426.65s]  Like these...
[4426.65s -> 4427.13s]  The weird...
[4427.93s -> 4430.09s]  Like kind of chroma...
[4430.09s -> 4430.65s]  Whatever it is.
[4430.65s -> 4431.21s]  You know what I'm saying?
[4431.93s -> 4433.21s]  It looks like electricity.
[4433.21s -> 4435.93s]  Like it's like a chromatic abrasion.
[4435.93s -> 4437.21s]  Yeah, chromatic abrasion filter.
[4439.26s -> 4440.14s]  I said half of it.
[4440.14s -> 4440.86s]  I said cro...
[4441.82s -> 4443.95s]  This is really nice.
[4443.95s -> 4444.35s]  Thank you.
[4446.35s -> 4447.23s]  This one's gonna take a minute.

[4647.87s -> 4650.28s]  Black and White 2 has Murius as a cow.
[4651.00s -> 4651.80s]  That's all I needed to hear.
[4654.72s -> 4655.76s]  That was so much fun.
[4660.99s -> 4662.27s]  This makes me happy.
[4662.27s -> 4662.83s]  It just does.
[4664.41s -> 4664.81s]  Thank you.
[4668.43s -> 4672.35s]  Oh, this is a depiction of the transitions.
[4679.88s -> 4680.12s]  Okay.
[4683.93s -> 4685.13s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4685.77s -> 4686.57s]  This is important.
[4687.61s -> 4692.17s]  You watch this stream on a cell phone vertical.
[4692.97s -> 4701.45s]  That's not enough room.
[4702.65s -> 4704.88s]  Sometimes the chat...
[4705.68s -> 4706.88s]  Yeah, that's not enough room though.
[4707.76s -> 4708.56s]  Is that enough room?
[4710.68s -> 4711.24s]  I'd do that.
[4711.80s -> 4713.92s]  I feel like I wouldn't be able to see anything.
[4714.56s -> 4718.20s]  That's what I'm doing right now.
[4718.84s -> 4719.48s]  Oh, shit.
[4721.39s -> 4722.59s]  You have to have chat on...
[4723.47s -> 4724.11s]  Oh, all right.
[4725.07s -> 4726.59s]  Don't they have a thing where you can touch the thing
[4726.59s -> 4728.59s]  and it transparently comes out as chat?
[4728.59s -> 4729.63s]  But I guess that's kind of annoying.
[4730.43s -> 4732.27s]  If you can see then, yeah.
[4733.15s -> 4735.63s]  I can imagine if I'm at the gym or if I'm on the toilet.
[4736.89s -> 4737.45s]  Yeah.
[4737.45s -> 4740.49s]  I don't think this person's at the gym or on the toilet though.
[4744.14s -> 4747.32s]  We already saw this.
[4747.32s -> 4749.32s]  Fox office record-breaking director.
[4755.84s -> 4757.04s]  Is this a joke from something?
[4757.04s -> 4758.56s]  I don't know this is from exactly.
[4759.28s -> 4762.84s]  Somebody cropped my meme.
[4762.84s -> 4767.72s]  That way somebody cropped this image from your submission
[4768.28s -> 4770.44s]  and then blew it up and then submitted it.
[4774.11s -> 4774.75s]  That's what happened?
[4777.10s -> 4781.24s]  Well, this is nice.
[4781.88s -> 4782.60s]  This is very nice.
[4783.24s -> 4790.49s]  But they didn't watermark it.
[4790.49s -> 4791.77s]  Well, we don't know who it was.
[4791.77s -> 4792.73s]  It could be anybody.
[4792.73s -> 4797.04s]  It's little Jeremy.
[4799.84s -> 4800.80s]  Plant Jeremy.
[4801.36s -> 4803.77s]  What's with the bottom right?
[4805.45s -> 4805.69s]  What?
[4805.69s -> 4806.89s]  Oh, it's just...
[4806.89s -> 4808.25s]  It's the signature.
[4809.80s -> 4810.44s]  The signature.
[4810.44s -> 4810.92s]  Signature.
[4811.64s -> 4814.35s]  Signature.
[4819.77s -> 4820.73s]  What do you mean that link?
[4823.37s -> 4824.65s]  What are you linking me right now?
[4832.35s -> 4835.13s]  This is not even real.
[4840.70s -> 4841.66s]  Wait, wait.
[4841.66s -> 4842.38s]  What happened?
[4843.26s -> 4844.38s]  Wait, what?
[4844.38s -> 4847.98s]  Hold on.
[4847.98s -> 4854.54s]  Wait, this is a dextero article about when I fell back in the chair on New Year's Eve.
[4860.91s -> 4863.15s]  There's an entire article written about this.
[4863.15s -> 4867.80s]  Hold on a second.
[4873.76s -> 4877.00s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4877.00s -> 4878.04s]  I want to read this.
[4878.04s -> 4892.11s]  Let's read this.
[4892.83s -> 4894.16s]  Let's read this article.
[4897.66s -> 4898.30s]  Okay, here we go.
[4901.82s -> 4902.30s]  This says,
[4902.86s -> 4907.31s]  Twitch streamer forgets how chairs work with a musing fall.
[4907.31s -> 4911.98s]  Twitch streamer Jeremy, Jerma985Elbertson,
[4911.98s -> 4916.86s]  struggled with his chair during his last broadcast of 2019 resulting in an amusing fall.
[4917.82s -> 4924.54s]  I don't get it.
[4924.54s -> 4926.51s]  God!
[4926.51s -> 4930.84s]  Wait, did I just...
[4931.88s -> 4933.64s]  This is the ad.
[4933.64s -> 4935.08s]  This is an ad.
[4935.08s -> 4935.48s]  This is...
[4935.48s -> 4935.80s]  Okay.
[4938.03s -> 4938.43s]  All right.
[4938.43s -> 4942.35s]  Jerma is a popular variety streamer that covers just about any category of game
[4942.35s -> 4945.39s]  and occasionally dips into IRL in real life content.
[4945.47s -> 4949.72s]  He was streaming a personal best and worst of 2019 on New Year's Eve
[4949.72s -> 4952.12s]  when one moment left him retreating into his chair
[4952.12s -> 4954.20s]  and then hilariously tumbling into the floor.
[4955.29s -> 4956.73s]  Why this image?
[4959.56s -> 4962.12s]  This is like the Jeremy loves money image.
[4963.00s -> 4965.16s]  Jerma is a variety Twitch streamer known for his entertaining...
[4965.16s -> 4966.36s]  God, dang, that's a nice thing to say.
[4967.96s -> 4969.00s]  The American.
[4970.20s -> 4970.92s]  The American.
[4972.36s -> 4975.36s]  I just reached the worst sound of 2009.
[4975.36s -> 4976.64s]  Am I getting to...
[4976.64s -> 4977.92s]  This is a real article.
[4977.92s -> 4979.28s]  I didn't get like fucking edited.
[4979.28s -> 4981.36s]  Somebody fucked me up and gave me a fake website, right?
[4991.58s -> 4995.02s]  Hey guys, I'm not seeing enough movement.
[4995.58s -> 4998.09s]  Why did it go over here?
[4998.81s -> 4999.77s]  Why did it go over here?
[5000.57s -> 5003.69s]  They want me to watch this video so bad.
[5005.66s -> 5006.54s]  Why did it go over here?
[5007.87s -> 5008.11s]  All right.
[5008.11s -> 5010.91s]  The American just reached the worst sound of 2019 category
[5010.91s -> 5012.51s]  and was not enjoying the winner,
[5012.51s -> 5016.27s]  which was the popular anime Ayaya's song,
[5016.27s -> 5019.79s]  something he claims he apologized about for over an hour.
[5020.35s -> 5025.45s]  Jeremy tried to get as far away from the song as possible,
[5025.45s -> 5026.41s]  sinking into his chair.
[5026.41s -> 5028.89s]  However, he quickly realized he'd gone a little too far
[5028.89s -> 5030.73s]  as the chair slid away from him
[5030.73s -> 5032.57s]  and he hilariously tumbled to the floor.
[5032.57s -> 5033.77s]  Oh shit, he screamed,
[5033.77s -> 5035.85s]  which was followed by a loud thud and a short silence
[5035.85s -> 5037.37s]  as he picked himself up off the floor.
[5048.19s -> 5048.59s]  Muted.
[5054.27s -> 5054.51s]  Okay.
[5055.23s -> 5056.89s]  Jeremy tried to be cool about it
[5056.89s -> 5059.21s]  and played it off as a real life fall joke,
[5059.85s -> 5062.59s]  but his chat was saw right through him,
[5062.59s -> 5063.71s]  enjoying the hilarious moment
[5063.71s -> 5065.63s]  while poking a little bit of fun at him.
[5065.71s -> 5067.95s]  And of course, spamming the classic L-U-L-E mode.
[5069.61s -> 5070.89s]  Fall joke.
[5070.89s -> 5072.41s]  However, he recovered after a short break
[5072.41s -> 5073.29s]  to regain his composure
[5073.29s -> 5075.05s]  and continued with his personal awards,
[5075.05s -> 5076.97s]  finally moving on to best noise,
[5076.97s -> 5081.29s]  which very well may have been his scream as he fell.
[5082.25s -> 5083.85s]  At least this happened at the end of the year
[5083.85s -> 5085.77s]  so he might be able to forget about it
[5085.77s -> 5087.13s]  and get a fresh start in 2020
[5087.13s -> 5088.89s]  as long as he remembers to be more careful.
[5096.49s -> 5098.17s]  What the fuck happened?
[5098.17s -> 5099.21s]  Classic Surgeon says,
[5099.21s -> 5101.93s]  doing this every morning can snap sagging skin back.
[5102.89s -> 5104.73s]  Or plastic surgeon takes picture
[5104.73s -> 5106.65s]  of two different people's hands.
[5106.65s -> 5116.67s]  I can't, this is fucking crazy.
[5118.51s -> 5119.39s]  This is crazy.
[5121.71s -> 5124.99s]  The best part is this Jeremy Albertson.
[5124.99s -> 5126.27s]  That's, I love it.
[5127.47s -> 5130.03s]  And this part, a real life fall joke.
[5130.91s -> 5132.83s]  Imagine writing this article and going,
[5132.83s -> 5147.76s]  they use the word hilariously six times.
[5148.72s -> 5150.64s]  It wouldn't be a bathwater of one.
[5151.28s -> 5153.20s]  No, no, I'm not reading any more articles.
[5157.36s -> 5158.40s]  What the fuck?
[5159.12s -> 5167.50s]  Hold on, this is all news to me.
[5168.14s -> 5170.62s]  Twitch streamer discovers a surprising true origin
[5170.62s -> 5172.70s]  of gamer girl bathwater.
[5180.43s -> 5181.15s]  What?
[5181.15s -> 5184.17s]  Hold on.
[5184.17s -> 5185.31s]  Wait, wait, wait, let's look.
[5185.31s -> 5186.11s]  I want to look at this first.
[5186.67s -> 5190.40s]  I want to look at this first.
[5190.40s -> 5191.12s]  Hold on.
[5191.12s -> 5192.32s]  This is a great image.
[5192.32s -> 5194.24s]  This is of the black and white.
[5194.24s -> 5201.13s]  This is black and white.
[5201.69s -> 5205.71s]  There's a not safe for worst picture in the article.
[5208.43s -> 5211.10s]  Yeah, it's all right.
[5211.10s -> 5212.06s]  We just need the first part.
[5212.62s -> 5216.48s]  All right, hold on.
[5216.48s -> 5221.12s]  This is so funny.
[5222.43s -> 5223.55s]  This is really funny.
[5223.55s -> 5225.23s]  It's really funny for one reason.
[5225.87s -> 5233.69s]  Twitch streamer discovers surprising true origin
[5233.69s -> 5234.97s]  of gamer girl bathwater.
[5237.29s -> 5240.57s]  While the bathwater trend went viral thanks to Belfdelphine,
[5241.13s -> 5244.89s]  Twitch streamer Jeremy German985 Harrington.
[5249.23s -> 5251.95s]  Okay, we've got different last names now.
[5252.83s -> 5254.91s]  May have found the first reference to the stunt
[5254.91s -> 5255.95s]  in popular culture.
[5256.91s -> 5257.47s]  All right.
[5257.47s -> 5258.27s]  What was it?
[5258.27s -> 5258.75s]  What was it?
[5267.61s -> 5268.57s]  Oh, I am fine.
[5274.09s -> 5274.65s]  I'm fine.
[5285.29s -> 5286.97s]  It's not the most flattering statement.
[5286.97s -> 5288.41s]  And it was, oh, yeah.
[5288.41s -> 5293.18s]  We didn't, didn't, didn't you say the Coke gaming?
[5293.90s -> 5299.52s]  Tyler one roast loser donator.
[5299.52s -> 5300.02s]  What?
[5300.81s -> 5301.31s]  What is this?
[5302.17s -> 5304.49s]  I can't do ads on websites.
[5304.49s -> 5305.85s]  I fucking, they get me.
[5308.57s -> 5309.29s]  All right.
[5309.29s -> 5310.81s]  It's not the most flattering statement.
[5310.81s -> 5311.21s]  It didn't work.
[5311.21s -> 5312.17s]  What's her with girl?
[5312.17s -> 5314.57s]  And the German was cackling in the background.
[5329.72s -> 5332.60s]  Twitch chat instantly exploded with references to Belfdelphine
[5332.60s -> 5335.32s]  in the gamer girl bathwater stunt too.
[5335.32s -> 5337.64s]  With many saying how topical and relevant this rent.
[5338.52s -> 5339.96s]  This is fucking freaking me out.
[5342.01s -> 5344.33s]  What took most people by surprise is now there's...
[5344.33s -> 5345.37s]  How many of these exist?
[5357.15s -> 5358.03s]  They're studying you.
[5360.27s -> 5361.71s]  MonkaS, they're studying you.
[5372.94s -> 5376.14s]  Well, Jerma Elbertson.
[5376.14s -> 5378.62s]  Jerma, I gotta have like, you know what?
[5378.62s -> 5380.62s]  That's how you can tell when somebody fucking doesn't even know
[5380.62s -> 5381.82s]  who the fuck you are.
[5382.20s -> 5385.64s]  It's like, you know, but let's throw out some more last names.
[5385.64s -> 5387.80s]  See if anybody actually fucking can even get it right.
[5387.80s -> 5388.28s]  You know what I mean?
[5388.28s -> 5391.24s]  Like, let's have like, Elbertson obviously is like my real name.
[5391.24s -> 5398.24s]  But let's give some other fake ones like Smith or something, right?
[5399.04s -> 5399.54s]  Smith.
[5400.24s -> 5403.88s]  I'm going to start referring to myself as like, as like Jeremy Smith.
[5404.60s -> 5416.86s]  Or like Jeremy O'Leary.
[5416.86s -> 5418.78s]  Jeremy O'Leary is another one.
[5418.78s -> 5419.66s]  Jeremy O'Leary.
[5420.22s -> 5422.86s]  That's my actual last name is actually O'Leary.
[5422.86s -> 5424.38s]  So I just fucking...
[5424.38s -> 5425.10s]  Whoopsie.
[5426.06s -> 5429.82s]  Dick Dastley Richard.
[5430.38s -> 5445.13s]  I've seen the Kotaku one.
[5445.13s -> 5446.30s]  I've already seen it.
[5446.86s -> 5449.64s]  This is great.
[5449.64s -> 5452.78s]  I have like, I have like the images over here.
[5452.78s -> 5453.58s]  I gotta get rid of these.
[5454.46s -> 5461.16s]  Dick Dastley Richard.
[5461.80s -> 5463.55s]  Looks good.
[5464.35s -> 5468.46s]  I love the finger smoke.
[5470.75s -> 5471.95s]  Gregory Hamilton.
[5472.83s -> 5475.96s]  Ooh, you got the treasure.
[5476.52s -> 5477.80s]  That's the best part about this image.
[5477.80s -> 5478.92s]  You actually got it.
[5478.92s -> 5485.48s]  I love that shirt.
[5485.48s -> 5486.28s]  I love that shirt.
[5486.28s -> 5486.84s]  I love that shirt.
[5486.84s -> 5487.80s]  This art's really good too.
[5492.22s -> 5492.62s]  Good shit.
[5493.26s -> 5496.35s]  The gamer?
[5496.35s -> 5497.95s]  Yeah, I saw the carnival one too.
[5498.67s -> 5504.04s]  Look at the glossiness of the eye.
[5505.98s -> 5506.62s]  Oh, I saw...
[5506.62s -> 5507.98s]  Somebody said something about me.
[5507.98s -> 5511.02s]  And I looked at it and I got self-conscious for a minute.
[5511.02s -> 5514.83s]  Somebody said that I look like just sweaty all the time.
[5515.47s -> 5517.13s]  They said I look like...
[5517.13s -> 5520.17s]  They said specifically that I look like the girl from Get Out.
[5520.17s -> 5521.13s]  They said he looks just...
[5521.13s -> 5523.05s]  He looks really like shiny and sweaty all the time.
[5523.05s -> 5524.25s]  He looks like the girl from Get Out.
[5524.25s -> 5532.76s]  And I was like, okay.
[5532.76s -> 5535.02s]  But I'm just like, do I have like...
[5540.48s -> 5541.44s]  Sludge coating.
[5541.44s -> 5541.76s]  Yeah.
[5542.32s -> 5545.84s]  I just dumped Dewey who said that it was a fucking thread.
[5546.40s -> 5546.96s]  I read it.
[5552.84s -> 5554.84s]  Your head is constantly rim-lit.
[5554.84s -> 5556.76s]  It's because I got a huge ass eyebrow bone.
[5558.30s -> 5562.20s]  Look, I have a big fucking eyebrow bone.
[5562.20s -> 5563.56s]  It comes out like this wide.
[5565.84s -> 5566.72s]  But this is fantastic.
[5566.72s -> 5568.08s]  This is very, very, very well done.
[5570.96s -> 5573.20s]  Which concludes the art portion.
[5573.84s -> 5575.52s]  We're going to move on to the video portion now.
[5576.83s -> 5577.95s]  It's Brow Ridge.
[5578.59s -> 5581.84s]  Get your eyebrows threaded.
[5581.84s -> 5583.20s]  No, Kim does my eyebrows.
[5583.92s -> 5584.40s]  She helps.
[5584.40s -> 5586.32s]  She does like the middle and she cleans up a little bit.
[5586.32s -> 5587.92s]  But I don't want to do too much craziness.
[5590.01s -> 5591.21s]  It's video time.
[5591.21s -> 5594.49s]  We're going to move on to videos.
[5594.49s -> 5603.85s]  Which now we have to turn off the relaxing Animal Crossing music.
[5604.89s -> 5614.46s]  So this first one is titled Jerma's True Shortness Revealed.
[5614.46s -> 5616.22s]  We're going to go off cam for these like always.
[5617.26s -> 5619.50s]  Jerma's True Shortness has been revealed.
[5620.46s -> 5624.12s]  He is exactly like you in every way.
[5628.60s -> 5630.75s]  Except one-eighth your size.
[5630.75s -> 5631.71s]  Oh my god.
[5632.83s -> 5633.87s]  Hi guys.
[5634.51s -> 5636.35s]  My spirit is leaving my body.
[5641.37s -> 5642.73s]  He is exactly like you.
[5644.81s -> 5646.51s]  Except one-eighth your size.
[5646.51s -> 5647.39s]  Oh my god.
[5648.67s -> 5649.64s]  Hi guys.
[5650.28s -> 5652.12s]  My spirit is leaving my body.
[5655.00s -> 5656.20s]  That right there.
[5656.20s -> 5657.72s]  It's so stupid.
[5658.84s -> 5660.46s]  It's so fucking dumb.
[5663.26s -> 5665.80s]  All right.
[5665.80s -> 5666.68s]  No spoilers.
[5666.68s -> 5668.12s]  Well, I change the next one.
[5669.16s -> 5673.74s]  This next one is called World of Warcraft.
[5673.74s -> 5675.90s]  World of JermaCraft episode one.
[5676.70s -> 5693.45s]  My son.
[5695.05s -> 5696.33s]  The day you were born.
[5704.68s -> 5705.88s]  What am I doing up here?
[5706.28s -> 5740.94s]  Is this just the please help I'm lost.
[5742.06s -> 5742.86s]  My child.
[5743.50s -> 5755.79s]  I watched with pride as you grew into a weapon.
[5755.79s -> 5761.21s]  Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, please don't do it, please don't do it.
[5762.49s -> 5763.98s]  What?
[5763.98s -> 5764.46s]  Hey.
[5764.46s -> 5780.67s]  You will show.
[5780.67s -> 5782.03s]  Was I getting an ad?
[5782.03s -> 5787.04s]  Who has ruled wisdom and strength.
[5787.04s -> 5789.18s]  It's time for you to pay.
[5789.18s -> 5796.36s]  Exercising your great power.
[5796.36s -> 5797.24s]  You're going down.
[5797.80s -> 5798.52s]  You're going down.
[5801.96s -> 5813.72s]  What?
[5813.72s -> 5830.99s]  The whole trailer.
[5830.99s -> 5831.49s]  What?
[5852.76s -> 5854.04s]  Absolutely terrible.
[5855.88s -> 5856.60s]  Nothing about this.
[5860.12s -> 5866.17s]  I tell you this.
[5867.61s -> 5870.09s]  For when my days have come to an end.
[5872.24s -> 5873.68s]  You shall be.
[5876.16s -> 5877.20s]  What the fuck?
[5879.55s -> 5880.51s]  He was hearthing.
[5881.95s -> 5883.15s]  Wait, was I actually hearthing?
[5885.39s -> 5887.82s]  What was victory, my son?
[5887.82s -> 5889.18s]  Absolutely terrible.
[5890.92s -> 5892.68s]  Nothing about this is good.
[5892.68s -> 5893.48s]  Not one thing.
[5895.00s -> 5901.02s]  I don't understand what I was doing.
[5901.02s -> 5903.12s]  I don't know what that was.
[5904.52s -> 5905.64s]  Oh, that was fucking good.
[5908.99s -> 5909.79s]  Teleporting.
[5910.99s -> 5913.08s]  It was an electro dealt.
[5916.16s -> 5918.96s]  This next one is called Stand Eye Catch.
[5920.08s -> 5920.88s]  Whatever that means.
[5920.88s -> 5921.38s]  Here it is.
[5927.23s -> 5940.22s]  I'm pissing cat off.
[5940.22s -> 5941.58s]  What? I didn't even do anything.
[5942.14s -> 5943.48s]  This is cool art.
[5953.82s -> 5954.46s]  Oh, it's Joe.
[5954.46s -> 5955.10s]  It's Jojo.
[5955.10s -> 5955.66s]  It's Jojo.
[5956.54s -> 5957.69s]  I see.
[5957.69s -> 5957.93s]  All right.
[5957.93s -> 5958.81s]  Well, this is fucking cool.
[5958.81s -> 5960.33s]  It still looks good.
[5960.33s -> 5962.25s]  I got like power in some of these categories.
[5963.29s -> 5965.61s]  Really cool.
[5966.41s -> 5974.73s]  Coming up next is I'm something of a scientist myself.
[5978.32s -> 5978.82s]  Can't wait.
[5982.24s -> 5983.52s]  Hi, Harry.
[5984.72s -> 5985.22s]  Harry.
[5985.84s -> 5987.24s]  Been needing this?
[5987.96s -> 5988.46s]  Yes, sir.
[5989.48s -> 5992.04s]  Peter, may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn.
[5992.04s -> 5993.64s]  Heard so much about you.
[5993.64s -> 5995.08s]  Great honor to meet you, sir.
[5995.08s -> 5997.32s]  Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.
[5997.32s -> 6000.36s]  You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.
[6000.36s -> 6002.68s]  I read all your research on nanotechnology.
[6002.68s -> 6003.56s]  Really brilliant.
[6003.56s -> 6004.76s]  And you understood it.
[6004.76s -> 6006.36s]  Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
[6006.92s -> 6008.12s]  Impressive.
[6008.12s -> 6010.04s]  Your parents must be very proud.
[6010.04s -> 6011.24s]  I live with my animals.
[6011.24s -> 6012.12s]  They are proud.
[6012.12s -> 6012.84s]  Hey, you two.
[6013.88s -> 6014.52s]  Let's move.
[6015.24s -> 6015.88s]  Nice to meet you.
[6015.88s -> 6016.52s]  Yeah.
[6016.52s -> 6017.48s]  Hope to see you again.
[6017.48s -> 6017.98s]  Yeah.
[6018.68s -> 6022.62s]  You don't seem so bad.
[6022.62s -> 6023.98s]  Yeah, not if you're a genius.
[6023.98s -> 6025.98s]  I think he wants to adopt you.
[6027.98s -> 6029.74s]  Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
[6029.74s -> 6035.69s]  Deepfaking is so crazy because it even gets the emotion correct.
[6037.69s -> 6040.01s]  Eventually, this technology is going to get so fucked up.
[6041.21s -> 6042.09s]  Look at the guys.
[6042.97s -> 6046.57s]  That's somebody actually focusing their eyes in different directions.
[6046.57s -> 6047.21s]  But I didn't do.
[6048.41s -> 6049.53s]  I live with my aunt and uncle.
[6049.53s -> 6050.41s]  They are proud.
[6050.41s -> 6051.13s]  Hey, you two.
[6051.93s -> 6052.57s]  Right there.
[6052.57s -> 6053.13s]  Even look at that.
[6053.85s -> 6054.81s]  Let's move.
[6054.81s -> 6056.17s]  That's a real emotion somebody's having.
[6056.17s -> 6057.29s]  Nice to meet you.
[6057.29s -> 6058.73s]  See you again.
[6058.73s -> 6061.31s]  This is going to be scary in like 30 fucking years.
[6063.93s -> 6065.61s]  We got another one of those coming up.
[6065.61s -> 6068.33s]  It's from the same movie, if you could guess.
[6068.33s -> 6070.73s]  It's called Out Am I.
[6071.77s -> 6073.72s]  Out Am I.
[6077.76s -> 6087.13s]  As of today, Oscorp Industries has surpassed Quest Aerospace.
[6087.13s -> 6088.25s]  That's a little Voldemorty.
[6088.25s -> 6092.81s]  As the principal supplier to the United States military.
[6092.81s -> 6098.43s]  In short, ladies and gentlemen of the board, costs are down, revenues are up,
[6099.15s -> 6101.47s]  and our stock has never been higher.
[6102.19s -> 6103.47s]  Wonderful news, Norman.
[6103.47s -> 6104.67s]  Lost it for a second.
[6104.67s -> 6106.43s]  Matter of fact, it's the reason we're selling the company.
[6107.74s -> 6108.22s]  What?
[6108.22s -> 6111.50s]  Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing.
[6112.22s -> 6112.78s]  Expanding.
[6114.16s -> 6116.32s]  They made a tender offer we can't ignore.
[6117.12s -> 6118.48s]  Why wasn't I told?
[6118.48s -> 6122.40s]  The last thing they want is a power struggle with entrenched management.
[6122.96s -> 6125.36s]  The deal is off if you come with it.
[6125.36s -> 6128.08s]  The board expects your resignation in 30 days.
[6128.96s -> 6130.56s]  But you can't do this to me.
[6134.08s -> 6135.60s]  I started this company.
[6137.45s -> 6139.21s]  You know how much I sacrificed?
[6144.73s -> 6146.01s]  Please, Norman.
[6146.01s -> 6148.22s]  The board is unanimous.
[6149.18s -> 6152.70s]  We're announcing the sale after the World Unity Festival.
[6153.42s -> 6154.65s]  I'm sorry.
[6154.65s -> 6157.50s]  You're out, Norman.
[6157.50s -> 6163.63s]  This is actually scary.
[6168.46s -> 6168.96s]  Am I?
[6173.95s -> 6174.75s]  Welcome to O-
[6177.56s -> 6178.20s]  Come with it.
[6179.48s -> 6181.32s]  Scariest part is for this, right?
[6181.32s -> 6184.60s]  Like, when it gets close, you can kind of see through the cracks a little.
[6185.40s -> 6189.36s]  But right here, it's-
[6190.16s -> 6191.15s]  Please.
[6191.15s -> 6192.83s]  That guy could be standing there doing this.
[6192.83s -> 6193.33s]  Norman.
[6194.03s -> 6196.44s]  It's still a little fucked up.
[6196.44s -> 6197.24s]  The board is-
[6197.88s -> 6200.00s]  The unanimous.
[6200.00s -> 6200.72s]  We're an out.
[6200.72s -> 6201.84s]  Oh, Max.
[6201.84s -> 6203.44s]  Please, Norman.
[6203.44s -> 6204.64s]  How long does it take to render this shit?
[6205.92s -> 6207.12s]  The anger part is good, too.
[6209.76s -> 6213.04s]  It takes like 50 hours to render this, doesn't it?
[6213.04s -> 6214.32s]  It takes like a week to render this.
[6216.24s -> 6217.36s]  About weeks to render.
[6218.57s -> 6219.05s]  Jesus.
[6219.05s -> 6221.96s]  That's insane.
[6221.96s -> 6223.40s]  I started this company.
[6225.21s -> 6226.97s]  You know how much I sacrificed?
[6230.43s -> 6231.15s]  Pretty good work.
[6231.15s -> 6231.63s]  Pretty good-
[6231.63s -> 6232.03s]  Actually, no.
[6232.03s -> 6232.91s]  Pretty good computer.
[6233.79s -> 6234.91s]  Pretty good computer.
[6235.39s -> 6240.80s]  I don't know what you're running this on.
[6240.80s -> 6244.00s]  Coming up next is when you show your friend your favorite streamer.
[6282.54s -> 6302.65s]  Dude, get that crap off my computer, bro.
[6321.96s -> 6326.20s]  I wonder how many of you guys have gone through the same scenario here.
[6327.96s -> 6329.32s]  That's so fucking funny.
[6332.48s -> 6335.44s]  Even the look on his face, too, is like, oh, fuck.
[6335.44s -> 6336.80s]  He doesn't think this is funny.
[6336.80s -> 6338.00s]  He thinks this guy sucks.
[6339.20s -> 6339.92s]  And I can tell.
[6340.56s -> 6341.20s]  Oh, look.
[6341.20s -> 6342.24s]  Hey, what do you know?
[6343.44s -> 6343.94s]  More.
[6345.68s -> 6346.80s]  I'm not even going to introduce it.
[6346.80s -> 6347.30s]  Just here.
[6361.04s -> 6366.48s]  Except one eighth your size.
[6367.04s -> 6368.08s]  You motherfucker.
[6369.20s -> 6370.40s]  Breathtaking.
[6370.40s -> 6374.46s]  I shall call him Mini-Me.
[6379.96s -> 6381.24s]  Come, Mr. Bigglesworth.
[6384.12s -> 6385.88s]  Mini-Me, are you hungry?
[6386.76s -> 6387.96s]  Something to eat.
[6387.96s -> 6390.72s]  Not even a hot pocket.
[6390.72s -> 6392.08s]  Jesus, that's too good.
[6392.88s -> 6395.76s]  No, no, we don't gnaw on our kitty.
[6395.76s -> 6396.40s]  Leave Mi-
[6396.40s -> 6396.90s]  No.
[6397.62s -> 6399.62s]  Leave Mini-Mr. Bigglesworth alone.
[6399.62s -> 6400.42s]  Just love him.
[6400.42s -> 6401.06s]  Stroke him.
[6403.39s -> 6410.27s]  As you know, every diabolical scheme that I've hatched has been thwarted by Austin Powers.
[6410.99s -> 6412.51s]  And why is that, ladies and gentlemen?
[6412.51s -> 6413.79s]  My mother watches this stream.
[6413.79s -> 6415.71s]  She's probably like freaking out right now.
[6415.71s -> 6419.46s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[6423.87s -> 6424.98s]  Down.
[6424.98s -> 6425.78s]  Down, Mini-Me.
[6430.59s -> 6431.47s]  Good computer.
[6431.47s -> 6432.59s]  You got a great computer.
[6433.55s -> 6436.93s]  The part that slayed me right here is this part where he takes like the bite.
[6437.97s -> 6439.90s]  It's just so fucking stupid.
[6439.90s -> 6440.46s]  Mini-Me, are you hungry?
[6441.34s -> 6442.46s]  Something to eat.
[6442.46s -> 6443.58s]  Not even a hot pocket.
[6445.70s -> 6446.26s]  An Eggo.
[6446.98s -> 6450.05s]  No, no, we don't gnaw on our kitty.
[6450.05s -> 6450.77s]  This face.
[6451.41s -> 6453.62s]  No, no, no, no.
[6456.45s -> 6464.11s]  Well, good thing we haven't done a community content night in a while,
[6464.11s -> 6466.35s]  considering that it took you two months to make these.
[6467.47s -> 6472.51s]  This movie's fucking hilarious, too.
[6473.47s -> 6481.28s]  This one's called Kira985.
[6484.06s -> 6491.62s]  This is Jojo.
[6491.62s -> 6494.13s]  This is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
[6494.13s -> 6495.54s]  Is Jojo reference?
[6496.74s -> 6514.90s]  This is called Howling at the Moon.
[6528.99s -> 6542.85s]  We don't need to see that one again.
[6543.65s -> 6545.39s]  We don't need to see that one anymore.
[6548.48s -> 6552.16s]  This is just a quick little two second video, but I thought the rats were cute, so.
[6557.22s -> 6559.06s]  Rats, rats, we are the rats.
[6559.06s -> 6560.26s]  It's infinitely loopable.
[6561.30s -> 6563.30s]  Rats, rats, we are the rats.
[6563.30s -> 6565.38s]  Rats, rats, we are the rats.
[6565.38s -> 6567.14s]  Rats, rats, we are the rats.
[6567.94s -> 6569.84s]  I thought it was cute.
[6569.84s -> 6572.16s]  It's a draft, I guess, of coming up with some stuff.
[6572.16s -> 6573.52s]  Maybe an animation or something.
[6574.64s -> 6577.15s]  You look suspiciously like a furry.
[6577.95s -> 6580.00s]  What are you talking about?
[6581.04s -> 6584.46s]  Now, this is a Who's That Shitty Germa character.
[6587.22s -> 6589.07s]  Who's that Pokemon?
[6589.23s -> 6595.87s]  It's the giant spider that tries to eat and kill you.
[6597.07s -> 6597.63s]  Tricked you.
[6597.63s -> 6601.23s]  It's Germacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[6601.23s -> 6601.63s]  Hold on.
[6601.63s -> 6603.55s]  This is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[6604.75s -> 6606.86s]  What's going on?
[6606.86s -> 6608.30s]  Did you hear what they just said?
[6608.30s -> 6609.66s]  I like the anime.
[6632.48s -> 6633.04s]  Oh, God.
[6638.62s -> 6644.59s]  All right, honest opinions.
[6644.59s -> 6645.47s]  What did you guys think?
[6646.03s -> 6646.59s]  Why is that?
[6649.39s -> 6650.67s]  Wait, why did this happen twice?
[6659.86s -> 6660.90s]  That was all over the place.
[6662.61s -> 6663.73s]  All right, honest opinions.
[6663.73s -> 6664.53s]  What did you guys think?
[6666.00s -> 6666.72s]  Minus two.
[6668.70s -> 6671.76s]  I mean, that's for you guys to decide, not for me.
[6672.56s -> 6673.20s]  Link, link.
[6673.20s -> 6675.04s]  I need this link, link, link, link, link.
[6675.04s -> 6675.92s]  All right, all right, all right.
[6680.16s -> 6680.72s]  Holy shit.
[6681.60s -> 6690.18s]  This one is called Patrick Warburton reviews Germa's impressions of his voice.
[6692.83s -> 6695.47s]  I don't want to watch this one.
[6695.47s -> 6697.15s]  I don't want to watch this one.
[6697.15s -> 6699.15s]  Hello, my name is Patrick Warburton.
[6699.15s -> 6701.23s]  I do cartoon voices.
[6701.23s -> 6702.27s]  I do voiceover.
[6702.27s -> 6703.95s]  I do cartoon characters.
[6703.95s -> 6707.31s]  Yo, I'm Family Guy Joe's, you know, he's a professional.
[6707.31s -> 6708.67s]  Peter, I'm a cop.
[6708.67s -> 6710.67s]  So people like to do impressions.
[6711.55s -> 6712.43s]  What the fuck?
[6712.43s -> 6713.63s]  Why does this keep happening?
[6713.63s -> 6715.23s]  Peter, I'm a cop.
[6715.23s -> 6717.71s]  So people like to do impressions.
[6717.71s -> 6720.83s]  And so we're going to look at some today and critique them.
[6722.91s -> 6729.81s]  Hello, Peter.
[6729.81s -> 6730.53s]  Peter.
[6730.53s -> 6731.57s]  Hey, Peter.
[6731.57s -> 6732.21s]  Hello, Peter.
[6733.09s -> 6735.23s]  Or should I say, Peter?
[6739.60s -> 6746.16s]  His approach there, I think, is right in tune because he is physicalizing.
[6746.16s -> 6749.20s]  He knows that it's his face that's informing his voice.
[6749.44s -> 6751.28s]  I feel so fancy.
[6752.88s -> 6754.32s]  This is my wheelchair.
[6754.32s -> 6756.32s]  There are many like it, but this one is mine.
[6756.32s -> 6758.08s]  I hate this video.
[6758.08s -> 6758.72s]  You guys are in.
[6758.72s -> 6759.44s]  This is the end game.
[6761.68s -> 6763.28s]  Peter, Peter.
[6763.28s -> 6764.40s]  We're at the end game now, Peter.
[6767.25s -> 6768.37s]  But we're in the end game, Peter.
[6771.31s -> 6772.67s]  My kids always make fun of me.
[6772.67s -> 6773.95s]  I think he does a very good job.
[6773.95s -> 6775.31s]  He's got the timber.
[6775.31s -> 6776.35s]  He brings it down.
[6776.35s -> 6779.15s]  Joe is, Joe's very officious.
[6779.71s -> 6780.91s]  That's where Joe comes from.
[6780.91s -> 6782.51s]  Because he's a police officer.
[6782.51s -> 6785.71s]  So, you know, everything that he says, he's got a little bit of that attitude.
[6785.71s -> 6786.99s]  There's so much more in this video.
[6786.99s -> 6788.03s]  I know what I'm talking about.
[6788.03s -> 6792.83s]  I'm a cop, a good cop, but very fine.
[6792.83s -> 6793.71s]  What the fuck was that?
[6793.71s -> 6795.07s]  Oh, I can't do it.
[6795.07s -> 6796.35s]  What just happened?
[6796.35s -> 6797.55s]  I'm so full.
[6797.55s -> 6798.51s]  What was that?
[6798.51s -> 6799.39s]  No facial hair.
[6801.15s -> 6802.51s]  Peter, it's Stewie Griffin.
[6803.71s -> 6814.06s]  Okay, I like what he does there with the physicality.
[6814.06s -> 6817.10s]  When you do that, that instructs your voice.
[6817.10s -> 6818.30s]  Guys have their tricks.
[6819.10s -> 6822.54s]  You know, my friend Tom Kenny does this thing.
[6824.56s -> 6826.32s]  Ah, it's me, SpongeBob.
[6827.52s -> 6828.72s]  You know how to do the SpongeBob laugh?
[6828.72s -> 6832.56s]  Take your finger, put it on like the bottom of your throat and shake up and down.
[6833.20s -> 6835.44s]  And go, ah, the hand technique.
[6835.44s -> 6837.92s]  Ah, ow, ow, fuck, that hurt.
[6837.92s -> 6838.40s]  Don't do that.
[6838.40s -> 6838.96s]  Nobody do that.
[6839.52s -> 6840.96s]  Don't do, I just hurt myself.
[6840.96s -> 6842.08s]  This poor fella.
[6842.64s -> 6849.73s]  Dr. Schmoinson?
[6849.73s -> 6855.60s]  I believe that is Beater.
[6855.60s -> 6856.32s]  Who is Beater?
[6857.89s -> 6859.01s]  What is Beater?
[6859.01s -> 6861.17s]  That's Joe on acid right there.
[6862.13s -> 6863.41s]  Can I poison him?
[6863.41s -> 6863.97s]  I'm sorry.
[6865.25s -> 6869.71s]  Smooth it out a little bit, but he's got a really nice style and tone there.
[6869.71s -> 6871.07s]  I think he's doing a very fine job.
[6871.79s -> 6873.63s]  That's the only critique I give him.
[6873.63s -> 6875.79s]  And here are some impressions of me.
[6876.67s -> 6877.17s]  What?
[6877.87s -> 6879.95s]  Hey, it's me, Patrick Warburton.
[6879.95s -> 6884.67s]  Cronk, you know, I'm Joe from Family Guy 2 and Beater.
[6884.67s -> 6887.55s]  Hey, Beater, let me tell you something, Beater.
[6887.55s -> 6889.07s]  Is that what we're talking about?
[6889.07s -> 6889.57s]  Cronk?
[6892.38s -> 6893.26s]  Beater.
[6893.26s -> 6893.90s]  That's what he does.
[6896.56s -> 6899.12s]  Problem is when you look at impressions of yourself, you're like,
[6899.12s -> 6900.80s]  oh my god, am I really like that?
[6900.80s -> 6903.04s]  I mean, I don't know who I look like anymore.
[6903.04s -> 6905.20s]  So that could be me right there.
[6906.83s -> 6912.75s]  Well, I'm Patrick Warburton and that was my critique of some fantastic work.
[6912.75s -> 6914.59s]  I'm so appreciating that.
[6914.59s -> 6915.23s]  God damn it.
[6915.23s -> 6916.59s]  That was fucking disgusting.
[6916.59s -> 6919.55s]  And the next time you see me, you can just kick me right in the nards.
[6919.55s -> 6920.05s]  Peter.
[6920.05s -> 6920.55s]  What?
[6920.55s -> 6921.05s]  Beater.
[6922.67s -> 6923.17s]  Hello?
[6928.16s -> 6931.20s]  And the next time you see me, you can just kick me right in the nards.
[6931.20s -> 6931.70s]  Peter.
[6933.60s -> 6934.24s]  Hello?
[6934.24s -> 6938.18s]  I'm losing my mind tonight.
[6939.38s -> 6941.62s]  All right, we got like the real meme ones today.
[6943.54s -> 6951.07s]  This is ultimate trickery.
[6951.79s -> 6953.23s]  Why is it a fucking Egypt?
[6953.23s -> 6954.27s]  What? No, no, no.
[6954.27s -> 6955.15s]  Trick you, it's-
[6955.15s -> 6956.11s]  Super frog.
[6956.11s -> 6957.15s]  Perhaps you don't like it.
[6957.15s -> 6957.63s]  It's got games.
[6957.63s -> 6958.51s]  So much better.
[6958.51s -> 6961.07s]  Well, you have like editing capabilities.
[6961.07s -> 6962.51s]  You know, you can do it if you want.
[6962.51s -> 6964.35s]  Well, I guess I could edit anything there.
[6965.95s -> 6970.45s]  Classic game of jewel wizardry.
[6971.84s -> 6974.88s]  If you think you're powerful enough to take on my challenge,
[6975.44s -> 6981.12s]  I'm wearing a fucking red dress and a bathrobe with a Diablo 2 Paladin Scepter.
[6981.12s -> 6982.56s]  Hey, you guys talked about this today.
[6983.92s -> 6984.56s]  Are you kidding me?
[6985.12s -> 6986.48s]  That isn't what happened.
[6986.48s -> 6987.20s]  That is not what happened.
[6987.20s -> 6988.08s]  That's exactly what happened.
[6988.08s -> 6988.72s]  What are you talking about?
[6988.72s -> 6989.76s]  No, it's not.
[6989.76s -> 6991.36s]  You- that was bullshit.
[6991.36s -> 6992.56s]  This is what really happened.
[6993.12s -> 6993.84s]  Oh, hold on a minute.
[6993.84s -> 6994.80s]  I'm wearing a super frog.
[6995.36s -> 6996.16s]  Let's quick zoom in.
[6996.88s -> 6997.68s]  Okay, you're not-
[6997.68s -> 6998.72s]  I didn't- hold on.
[6998.72s -> 6999.68s]  Okay, you're not liking it.
[6999.68s -> 7000.40s]  It's got candy.
[7000.40s -> 7001.52s]  I'm losing my mind tonight.
[7001.52s -> 7002.16s]  Reference.
[7002.16s -> 7002.96s]  That's the line that-
[7002.96s -> 7004.40s]  That made me famous.
[7004.40s -> 7005.52s]  That's not what happened.
[7005.52s -> 7006.96s]  That's not even close to what happened.
[7008.67s -> 7009.63s]  Every little dog fight.
[7010.59s -> 7018.03s]  What a beautiful working day.
[7018.03s -> 7020.27s]  Your first mission is to destroy a nearby factory.
[7020.99s -> 7021.49s]  Okay.
[7026.80s -> 7027.92s]  No, no, no.
[7027.92s -> 7028.64s]  There was no truck.
[7028.64s -> 7029.36s]  There was no- look.
[7029.92s -> 7033.44s]  The one thing that's been in common of this whole thing is
[7033.44s -> 7034.08s]  it's over.
[7034.08s -> 7034.40s]  Yeah.
[7034.40s -> 7037.04s]  That's been a part of all of our flashbacks.
[7037.04s -> 7039.04s]  It has to do with something about it's over.
[7039.04s -> 7039.60s]  I don't know what.
[7040.40s -> 7042.18s]  I'll tell you right now.
[7042.18s -> 7043.70s]  No, I'm gonna put my foot down.
[7043.70s -> 7044.20s]  It's-
[7045.07s -> 7046.19s]  Why is it a fucking Egypt?
[7046.19s -> 7046.43s]  What?
[7046.43s -> 7047.23s]  No, no, no.
[7047.23s -> 7047.79s]  I tricked you.
[7047.79s -> 7048.43s]  It's over.
[7048.43s -> 7050.83s]  What drugs are you on today?
[7051.79s -> 7053.02s]  I can't.
[7053.02s -> 7054.86s]  I can't with these today.
[7055.98s -> 7059.65s]  This is the crack stream.
[7059.65s -> 7061.97s]  This is like the community crack night.
[7062.93s -> 7069.90s]  A fresh slap meets an old classic.
[7070.94s -> 7073.92s]  Oh, you want to fight?
[7073.92s -> 7074.72s]  You want to fight?
[7074.72s -> 7076.00s]  Don't fucking come at me.
[7076.00s -> 7076.64s]  Don't-
[7076.64s -> 7077.76s]  Ow, my butthole.
[7078.48s -> 7080.37s]  For what?
[7081.41s -> 7087.15s]  I've said a lot of words in my life.
[7087.71s -> 7088.51s]  Oh, spoilers.
[7089.07s -> 7092.66s]  This one's called a real statement.
[7092.66s -> 7094.10s]  A real statement.
[7094.10s -> 7095.30s]  It's a statement.
[7095.30s -> 7097.98s]  And if you want to hear what I'm talking about here,
[7098.78s -> 7100.94s]  I'm talking about a real statement.
[7100.94s -> 7103.73s]  A see-through gold play-
[7104.85s -> 7106.29s]  Why is it a fucking Egypt?
[7106.29s -> 7106.53s]  What?
[7106.53s -> 7107.25s]  No, no, no.
[7107.25s -> 7107.81s]  I tricked you.
[7107.81s -> 7109.97s]  It's Egypt and we're both flog pyros.
[7114.98s -> 7116.42s]  These are all different videos, by the way.
[7118.66s -> 7121.86s]  Derma slap best quality 2020 edition.
[7122.50s -> 7126.42s]  I can do that better.
[7126.90s -> 7130.29s]  Oh, you want to fight?
[7130.29s -> 7131.25s]  You want to fight?
[7131.25s -> 7132.53s]  Don't fucking come at me.
[7132.53s -> 7133.33s]  Don't-
[7133.33s -> 7133.57s]  No.
[7133.57s -> 7134.13s]  I tricked you.
[7134.13s -> 7136.29s]  It's Egypt and we're both flog pyros.
[7137.01s -> 7148.22s]  Okay, this one's called flash bang out.
[7149.26s -> 7150.54s]  Fucking goddamn spoilers.
[7150.54s -> 7151.02s]  Whatever.
[7151.02s -> 7151.50s]  I don't care.
[7154.22s -> 7155.26s]  On the ground now!
[7155.26s -> 7157.20s]  We're in trouble now, asshole!
[7157.20s -> 7157.92s]  Flash out!
[7159.60s -> 7172.46s]  Derma fights against the secret undertale boss.
[7175.54s -> 7176.90s]  Secret undertale boss.
[7177.62s -> 7178.66s]  I wonder what it's going to be.
[7186.83s -> 7187.31s]  Not true.
[7190.46s -> 7190.94s]  Is true.
[7191.82s -> 7195.78s]  Two out of three.
[7195.78s -> 7199.84s]  Three out of four.
[7200.80s -> 7209.65s]  The giant enemy spider.
[7212.53s -> 7226.96s]  This whole thing, the whole-
[7227.76s -> 7243.54s]  Three donations until the end of the stream.
[7245.30s -> 7261.62s]  Okay, okay.
[7266.96s -> 7268.16s]  Video games suck.
[7268.16s -> 7269.28s]  Video games suck.
[7269.28s -> 7270.40s]  Video games suck.
[7270.40s -> 7271.68s]  Video games suck.
[7271.68s -> 7272.56s]  All video games.
[7272.56s -> 7273.36s]  None of them were fun.
[7273.36s -> 7274.16s]  All of them suck.
[7274.16s -> 7275.36s]  All video games suck.
[7275.36s -> 7277.36s]  I'm never playing a video game ever again.
[7280.30s -> 7283.30s]  That was really good.
[7284.26s -> 7286.88s]  That was very, very well done.
[7287.68s -> 7289.20s]  Even have the actual fight too.
[7294.50s -> 7294.82s]  No.
[7294.82s -> 7295.38s]  My turn.
[7295.38s -> 7296.10s]  My turn.
[7296.10s -> 7296.82s]  My turn.
[7296.82s -> 7297.22s]  My turn.
[7298.18s -> 7300.34s]  Oh, get Matador!
[7300.34s -> 7301.54s]  Did you really just get him?
[7302.34s -> 7307.58s]  Community crack night going strong.
[7307.58s -> 7308.14s]  Spoilers.
[7308.14s -> 7308.54s]  Whatever.
[7313.20s -> 7314.88s]  Yoda got a message from Derma.
[7318.58s -> 7319.14s]  Fuck you.
[7322.27s -> 7328.19s]  That's the whole message.
[7329.28s -> 7329.84s]  Fuck you.
[7329.84s -> 7345.84s]  Crazy J.
[7345.84s -> 7346.64s]  Crazy J.
[7347.68s -> 7348.40s]  What's going on?
[7350.16s -> 7351.04s]  What's going on?
[7355.20s -> 7361.54s]  360 feet.
[7363.86s -> 7368.11s]  There's a quick little-
[7368.11s -> 7370.19s]  I told you we should have named it like Bites.
[7370.19s -> 7370.75s]  Or Snacks.
[7370.75s -> 7372.19s]  Community content snacks.
[7372.19s -> 7372.91s]  What's going on?
[7374.67s -> 7375.55s]  What's going on?
[7376.67s -> 7380.54s]  These are snacks.
[7381.02s -> 7381.58s]  Oh, this is-
[7381.58s -> 7383.18s]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[7383.18s -> 7386.14s]  A snake in the clouds, read by the actual author.
[7387.34s -> 7389.22s]  Look at this.
[7389.70s -> 7400.16s]  A snake in the clouds, written by Jeremy Albertson.
[7400.64s -> 7413.89s]  There once was a snake that did not care.
[7419.10s -> 7420.37s]  Got up on a cloud.
[7420.37s -> 7421.01s]  Who's that?
[7421.01s -> 7422.21s]  How did he get there?
[7427.12s -> 7431.84s]  To his friends and family, he did say goodbye.
[7431.84s -> 7437.47s]  On a whim, he wanted to try for the sky.
[7439.23s -> 7444.85s]  Soaring and slithering, how high can he go?
[7446.99s -> 7448.03s]  Oh, it was empty.
[7448.03s -> 7448.53s]  Yeah.
[7457.84s -> 7460.48s]  This is the point where the streamer gave up.
[7462.00s -> 7463.12s]  Turns out you can't-
[7463.12s -> 7470.27s]  But you can do it if you want to, otherwise just fly to the sky.
[7471.86s -> 7473.14s]  Was this the whole story?
[7473.94s -> 7474.42s]  Is it?
[7474.42s -> 7476.67s]  No, there was more story, wasn't there?
[7476.67s -> 7481.82s]  I swear to God, there was like a-
[7481.82s -> 7482.94s]  There was a whole story.
[7483.50s -> 7490.42s]  I swear to God, there was like a-
[7490.42s -> 7491.06s]  About how he-
[7491.70s -> 7494.10s]  As friends, he like left all his friends and family and stuff,
[7494.10s -> 7495.54s]  and he became like a-
[7495.54s -> 7497.30s]  Like a super capitalist or something,
[7497.30s -> 7498.50s]  but it was something crazy, right?
[7498.50s -> 7498.98s]  What happened?
[7499.94s -> 7503.54s]  Remember when there was like-
[7503.54s -> 7504.26s]  He like-
[7504.26s -> 7506.02s]  Remember when we were talking about how he had made like
[7506.02s -> 7507.70s]  fucking 500 trillion dollars or something?
[7511.55s -> 7512.51s]  No, I swear to God.
[7513.23s -> 7515.86s]  He's on crack tonight.
[7515.86s -> 7517.62s]  No, no, no, it was like-
[7517.62s -> 7518.82s]  Yeah, look at the key.
[7518.82s -> 7520.42s]  It was all like a gold bar and shit.
[7520.42s -> 7521.54s]  Yeah, no, no, no, they got it.
[7522.42s -> 7524.42s]  Was this like friends looking for him and stuff?
[7528.96s -> 7530.40s]  Go, go, go read that stream.
[7531.04s -> 7531.44s]  You'll see.
[7532.24s -> 7533.44s]  I'm not, I'm not on crack tonight.
[7533.44s -> 7534.80s]  This is community crack snacks.
[7534.80s -> 7536.80s]  Not, not streamer does crack on stream.
[7539.62s -> 7541.30s]  Giant enemy Muffet.
[7541.30s -> 7552.48s]  The giant enemy spider.
[7563.63s -> 7564.83s]  All right, you guys gotta film me in.
[7565.39s -> 7567.07s]  What happened with the giant enemy spider?
[7567.07s -> 7567.95s]  Why, why does everybody-
[7567.95s -> 7568.51s]  What happened?
[7568.51s -> 7569.23s]  Why did it come back?
[7570.35s -> 7572.64s]  It came back so strong.
[7573.44s -> 7576.40s]  It was just a random thing I did in a video from like 2013.
[7577.36s -> 7580.16s]  And it's been around for a long time.
[7580.16s -> 7581.20s]  It just kind of happened, I guess.
[7582.00s -> 7583.52s]  You are trending on Instagram.
[7584.56s -> 7587.20s]  How do you trend on Instagram?
[7588.32s -> 7589.76s]  You can, you can, that's a thing?
[7589.76s -> 7590.40s]  You can do that?
[7594.05s -> 7594.93s]  That's not right.
[7595.49s -> 7596.53s]  It's not right at all.
[7597.09s -> 7598.29s]  Giant enemy tree.
[7606.32s -> 7622.27s]  Activate windows?
[7623.31s -> 7623.71s]  What do you mean?
[7623.71s -> 7625.79s]  Do I not have an activated copy of windows?
[7627.79s -> 7628.59s]  What are you talking about?
[7628.59s -> 7629.63s]  Why did somebody just say that?
[7638.74s -> 7647.10s]  Well, activate windows.
[7648.14s -> 7653.42s]  Dudes run on a, dudes run on a fucking pirated windows copy.
[7654.30s -> 7657.63s]  All right, what's next?
[7658.67s -> 7663.65s]  All right, this is McDonald, McDerma?
[7663.73s -> 7666.69s]  McDerma, do I eat ass?
[7666.69s -> 7667.33s]  Of course I do.
[7669.57s -> 7670.37s]  Piss in my face.
[7671.25s -> 7672.21s]  Immunity crack night.
[7672.21s -> 7674.05s]  Community, community smoke crack snacks.
[7675.60s -> 7676.72s]  Do I eat ass?
[7677.28s -> 7677.92s]  Of course I do.
[7680.16s -> 7680.96s]  Piss in my face.
[7681.84s -> 7685.44s]  I mean, this is just, this is the, this is the drug stream.
[7686.24s -> 7701.04s]  Shut the fuck up, I'm listening to I Feel Fine.
[7703.79s -> 7705.07s]  Didn't we see this already?
[7715.92s -> 7726.32s]  It's sped up or something?
[7740.42s -> 7743.86s]  That's one of those streams where I, when I watch that back, eventually if I ever do,
[7744.66s -> 7747.62s]  there's going to be a lot of weird clips of me fucking moving around with my eyes closed
[7747.62s -> 7748.26s]  and shit.
[7748.26s -> 7749.38s]  I'm certain of it.
[7749.94s -> 7751.38s]  I'm absolutely certain of it.
[7751.38s -> 7753.52s]  What do you care about spoilers?
[7754.08s -> 7760.53s]  This one's called Morbus, Morbius, It's Your Birthday Today.
[7764.96s -> 7765.36s]  Michael.
[7769.36s -> 7769.68s]  Michael.
[7773.36s -> 7792.70s]  This one's called, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[7792.70s -> 7793.58s]  That's actually the title.
[7795.31s -> 7811.65s]  Oh, smoke crack, smoke crack, crack stream.
[7811.65s -> 7812.37s]  Why is it not here?
[7816.86s -> 7817.74s]  What the fuck?
[7817.74s -> 7826.64s]  Don't smoke crack, it's fucking bad for you.
[7827.76s -> 7829.12s]  Okay, all right, all right.
[7829.12s -> 7830.96s]  I got to get on cam for this because I have to do this.
[7830.96s -> 7834.96s]  I have to do this because I made sure that these were going to be together.
[7834.96s -> 7838.96s]  I know I make, when I saw the titles, I'm like, I got to put them in the right spot.
[7839.60s -> 7842.80s]  There's only ones that I really looked at beforehand to know what the fuck they were.
[7844.08s -> 7847.68s]  I am sorry about the next four to five videos.
[7847.68s -> 7850.96s]  I'm sorry I'm apologizing because people are going to make me do it anyways.
[7850.96s -> 7853.12s]  I'm sorry and I'm not going to say it again.
[7853.84s -> 7854.32s]  I'm sorry.
[7867.95s -> 7894.85s]  Oh shit.
[7894.85s -> 7895.73s]  Ow, my butthole.
[7898.03s -> 7898.75s]  What?
[7898.75s -> 7899.87s]  Okay, that was funny.
[7901.63s -> 7902.67s]  All right, that was good, too.
[7902.67s -> 7903.23s]  What's the next?
[7914.67s -> 7923.98s]  Why is it a fucking Egypt?
[7923.98s -> 7924.22s]  What?
[7924.22s -> 7924.94s]  No, no, no.
[7924.94s -> 7925.50s]  I tricked you.
[7925.50s -> 7927.34s]  It's Egypt and we're both flog.
[7927.34s -> 7939.46s]  Jerma's guilty pleasure.
[7946.18s -> 7950.64s]  I think that's it.
[7950.64s -> 7951.52s]  I think that's over.
[7951.52s -> 7953.04s]  I think I don't think this anymore.
[7953.04s -> 7954.64s]  I think we just had to get through them.
[7955.44s -> 7956.40s]  We had to get through them.
[7958.05s -> 7959.46s]  All right.
[7959.46s -> 7960.98s]  I already apologized already.
[7960.98s -> 7962.10s]  I said I'm sorry.
[7962.10s -> 7965.73s]  This one is the giant enemy spider, but on Mario Paint.
[7967.97s -> 7971.52s]  I think we've seen this before.
[7992.93s -> 7993.81s]  This is remade.
[7995.65s -> 7998.14s]  It's just Pokemon.
[7998.14s -> 7999.50s]  Yeah, I know, right?
[7999.50s -> 7999.82s]  It is.
[8001.10s -> 8002.38s]  It is just Pokemon.
[8002.38s -> 8003.50s]  So what's what?
[8003.50s -> 8011.20s]  Okay, so it's not the giant enemy spider theme song.
[8011.20s -> 8014.08s]  It's just one of the Pokemon battle themes.
[8014.08s -> 8014.40s]  Yeah.
[8014.40s -> 8015.68s]  So what what's going on?
[8016.64s -> 8022.32s]  Don't talk about me.
[8022.32s -> 8024.32s]  I thought I'm just doing the Pokemon song.
[8032.24s -> 8034.16s]  That's not the giant enemy spider theme song.
[8037.12s -> 8038.80s]  I stole that from Pokemon.
[8038.80s -> 8039.76s]  I stole it.
[8042.30s -> 8052.37s]  This actually is really good, though.
[8053.17s -> 8056.75s]  Make an original right now.
[8056.75s -> 8057.07s]  I did.
[8057.07s -> 8058.35s]  It was the giant enemy tree.
[8062.70s -> 8063.50s]  I did that already.
[8077.84s -> 8079.04s]  Second one is never as good.
[8079.04s -> 8080.16s]  This is really good, though.
[8080.16s -> 8080.64s]  Nice work.
[8080.64s -> 8081.36s]  Let's link this one.
[8082.56s -> 8085.30s]  How do I remember it?
[8085.30s -> 8086.82s]  Because it's three notes.
[8087.78s -> 8090.26s]  It's not hard for me to remember the three notes.
[8091.30s -> 8092.22s]  All right.
[8092.22s -> 8094.94s]  This one's called, you know, I'm just going to let you figure it out.
[8106.91s -> 8108.91s]  Yes, we sense.
[8113.63s -> 8115.31s]  The giant enemy spider.
[8117.79s -> 8126.18s]  We must stop him now.
[8126.18s -> 8128.02s]  Yes, now we have no choice.
[8129.78s -> 8132.59s]  Okay, for a second, the reason why I scrolled over here
[8132.59s -> 8134.99s]  is because I thought it was another unactivated windows.
[8135.79s -> 8137.79s]  I was like, damn, you guys don't have windows.
[8138.75s -> 8150.61s]  This one's called waste of 14 seconds.
[8152.93s -> 8154.37s]  At least they're honest about it, I guess.
[8155.25s -> 8155.75s]  Yeah.
[8156.85s -> 8162.86s]  See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle in this.
[8164.03s -> 8164.83s]  The giant.
[8164.83s -> 8166.27s]  Oh, oh, farting monkey.
[8170.03s -> 8171.63s]  Oh, I hate dog.
[8171.63s -> 8172.19s]  All right.
[8172.19s -> 8172.51s]  All right.
[8172.51s -> 8172.99s]  You wait.
[8172.99s -> 8174.11s]  Well, that was a waste of time.
[8174.11s -> 8175.07s]  That was a waste of time.
[8175.07s -> 8176.35s]  That was a waste.
[8176.35s -> 8177.49s]  All right.
[8177.49s -> 8178.21s]  Get it off.
[8178.21s -> 8182.78s]  I mean, Nintendo is here.
[8184.06s -> 8184.38s]  What do you mean?
[8184.38s -> 8185.18s]  Nintendo is here.
[8192.27s -> 8192.99s]  Nintendo is in.
[8192.99s -> 8194.67s]  Nintendo is hanging out in the stream.
[8194.67s -> 8195.31s]  No, they're not.
[8196.27s -> 8198.61s]  Where's the viewer list?
[8209.90s -> 8210.94s]  That's a lie.
[8210.94s -> 8211.90s]  Nintendo is not here.
[8213.02s -> 8217.89s]  Give me the link now.
[8217.89s -> 8218.13s]  All right.
[8219.65s -> 8221.58s]  They actually were.
[8221.58s -> 8223.10s]  No, they were not.
[8223.10s -> 8223.98s]  They were not.
[8225.34s -> 8230.70s]  The official at Nintendo Twitch channel guys only logs in to stream directs.
[8230.70s -> 8233.90s]  They don't hang out and people stream and like gift a thousand subs.
[8234.54s -> 8235.76s]  You know what I mean?
[8235.76s -> 8238.24s]  It's not like here comes Nintendo with like a huge.
[8238.24s -> 8239.60s]  I got like millions of dollars.
[8240.56s -> 8241.74s]  They were not.
[8241.74s -> 8242.14s]  They were.
[8242.14s -> 8242.70s]  They were not here.
[8242.70s -> 8243.18s]  No way.
[8243.18s -> 8244.06s]  I don't believe it.
[8244.06s -> 8246.94s]  When were they here?
[8247.50s -> 8249.89s]  What did you say?
[8249.89s -> 8250.29s]  You idiot.
[8250.29s -> 8250.93s]  What are you talking about?
[8250.93s -> 8251.57s]  They were here.
[8251.57s -> 8252.45s]  They were actually here.
[8252.45s -> 8259.90s]  Somebody prove it like three minutes ago.
[8260.54s -> 8261.25s]  Hold on.
[8262.37s -> 8265.33s]  You mean to tell me that Nintendo actually Nintendo account was here.
[8266.14s -> 8268.22s]  And when I write, when I clicked this button.
[8268.22s -> 8272.27s]  See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle of this.
[8273.47s -> 8275.71s]  The giant farting monkey.
[8277.55s -> 8279.79s]  They left because of that.
[8280.43s -> 8281.71s]  Oh my fucking God.
[8282.35s -> 8282.83s]  What do you mean?
[8282.83s -> 8283.31s]  His proof.
[8283.31s -> 8284.03s]  This could be doctored.
[8284.03s -> 8285.71s]  You could have you could have doctored this up.
[8286.75s -> 8296.24s]  It could be doctored.
[8297.04s -> 8300.14s]  It's real.
[8306.91s -> 8307.63s]  Hi, Nintendo.
[8309.15s -> 8309.95s]  Hi, Nintendo.
[8310.83s -> 8312.03s]  German985 here.
[8313.15s -> 8315.71s]  Hope you're not browsing around channels to sue.
[8319.49s -> 8320.69s]  Why else would you be here?
[8322.22s -> 8336.08s]  He stole the team that the.
[8336.08s -> 8337.44s]  Oh, actually, this is kind of fucking cool.
[8338.48s -> 8340.26s]  Take a look at this.
[8342.80s -> 8344.48s]  The giant enemy spider.
[8346.78s -> 8354.99s]  That's pretty sick.
[8355.47s -> 8356.83s]  That was really good.
[8356.83s -> 8358.51s]  The giant enemy spider.
[8360.91s -> 8364.32s]  Just want to make this really clear.
[8365.20s -> 8366.42s]  Huge Nintendo fan.
[8366.42s -> 8367.78s]  Like absolutely massive Nintendo.
[8367.78s -> 8369.78s]  I'm the only person that streamed the Nintendo Labo.
[8369.78s -> 8370.82s]  All of them.
[8370.82s -> 8373.38s]  I'm the number one Nintendo Labo streamer on Twitch.
[8373.38s -> 8374.02s]  That's naughty.
[8374.02s -> 8374.58s]  That's not a joke.
[8374.58s -> 8375.54s]  That is a fact.
[8375.54s -> 8376.66s]  That is an actual fact.
[8377.94s -> 8379.54s]  So I mean, I love this company.
[8380.34s -> 8391.14s]  That was awesome.
[8391.14s -> 8393.41s]  All right.
[8393.41s -> 8394.45s]  We're getting close to the end here.
[8394.45s -> 8396.69s]  We have more.
[8396.69s -> 8397.81s]  I knew we were going to get these.
[8397.81s -> 8398.61s]  So here we go.
[8399.09s -> 8400.77s]  This is called German when nobody's looking.
[8400.77s -> 8402.29s]  We saw a couple of these already during the.
[8403.09s -> 8403.97s]  You look pissed off.
[8403.97s -> 8404.21s]  What?
[8405.33s -> 8423.92s]  We already saw this one.
[8423.92s -> 8425.52s]  Yeah, it's worth a second look.
[8433.84s -> 8434.32s]  Psycho.
[8435.60s -> 8436.88s]  What a fucking psycho.
[8436.88s -> 8438.40s]  It's like that's murderer vibes.
[8438.40s -> 8438.88s]  You know what I mean?
[8439.84s -> 8444.78s]  This one's called German encounters.
[8444.78s -> 8448.91s]  A something, something, something.
[8448.91s -> 8450.59s]  The giant enemy spider.
[8453.90s -> 8454.78s]  Enemy spider.
[8473.98s -> 8474.54s]  Fricked you.
[8474.54s -> 8475.18s]  It's Egypt.
[8475.18s -> 8476.62s]  We're both flogged pyros.
[8476.62s -> 8477.34s]  I'm waiting for it.
[8478.30s -> 8484.51s]  I think it's just a good song.
[8484.51s -> 8484.91s]  What a way.
[8484.91s -> 8485.87s]  I think it's just a good song.
[8486.59s -> 8515.84s]  But here I'm saying dude, John Nintendo.
[8517.02s -> 8517.58s]  No way.
[8518.22s -> 8533.54s]  Really good.
[8533.54s -> 8538.43s]  Check the gifted subs.
[8538.43s -> 8540.43s]  Yeah, but you can give you can give some anybody.
[8540.43s -> 8542.75s]  Anything I can give some anybody right now.
[8542.75s -> 8543.71s]  They just type in their name.
[8543.71s -> 8544.27s]  Can I?
[8544.27s -> 8550.53s]  This one's called German and star symphony.

[9199.47s -> 9207.63s]  And that just opened up the floodgates, but just just dump in and now it's we're gonna hear
[9207.63s -> 9215.92s]  I'm gonna have to apologize every day. You're gonna get apology every single day a bigger. There we go
[9216.92s -> 9221.14s]  This one's called giant enemy spider
[9222.14s -> 9227.27s]  That there was a boss battle of this the giant enemy spider
[9229.87s -> 9238.45s]  Stop apologizing fuck them
[9266.88s -> 9273.70s]  At Nintendo copyright, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on. I don't talk over this part

[9319.22s -> 9323.30s]  Not a real lawyer. It was good. And
[9325.29s -> 9327.29s]  finally finally
[9327.97s -> 9329.97s]  last thing of the night we have
[9330.93s -> 9333.93s]  Jermis spider undertale joke dot wave
[9334.45s -> 9344.67s]  Question these kind of I guess they go they go together, right like giant enemy spider and
[9345.43s -> 9352.51s]  Spider boss from undertale because this is this is like undertale crossover number like four or five with giant enemy spider. Thanks
[9352.51s -> 9354.51s]  That makes sense
[9406.69s -> 9410.34s]  Fuck yeah, fuck. Yeah
[9410.54s -> 9413.34s]  Good stuff good stuff
[9415.05s -> 9417.29s]  All right, there we go
[9426.62s -> 9434.54s]  Good cider give us the link you want the link to that one. Yeah, they're all available in the in that discord channel
[9435.38s -> 9442.61s]  What's what people what's going on?
[9443.13s -> 9444.65s]  year of the rat
[9444.65s -> 9447.18s]  What did I not?
[9447.18s -> 9453.35s]  When was this uploaded? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's why. Yeah, so
[9454.59s -> 9458.47s]  The reason why I didn't put this one in is because this is as of last week
[9458.47s -> 9464.17s]  And I figured that we can have obviously we'll do this again in February
[9464.89s -> 9467.29s]  Watch it now. Well that this is not fair skipping
[9469.05s -> 9479.96s]  30 other videos. That's not fair now now now now now now now now now now
[9480.44s -> 9487.90s]  Now the next community content night is not gonna be three months from now. Don't worry
[9488.46s -> 9495.72s]  The really the reasoning to do this up until about like the sick 15 16 to 18th or so
[9496.12s -> 9500.20s]  Is in the first or second week of February, I can actually do another one on time
[9501.24s -> 9508.90s]  Make an exception. It's the year of the rat. I think an exception is the year of the rat. It's a year of the rat
[9509.70s -> 9518.15s]  All right. All right. Fine. Fine. If ever ever. All right. All right. All right
[9518.95s -> 9521.51s]  All right, you're gonna be shut down buddy
[9522.23s -> 9528.33s]  There's also another video that I want to show too that we'll put in the next one as well
[9529.37s -> 9533.99s]  That was longer than five minutes, but
[9533.99s -> 9536.23s]  We're gonna make an exception for it. So
[9537.11s -> 9546.54s]  But yeah, remember that if people are like, whoa, what happened? What about I uploaded something to january 23rd?
[9547.50s -> 9553.66s]  That's because it's as of like a week ago or so. So all these things are as of like the weekend of the 18th

[9573.18s -> 9577.30s]  He's like a million miles per hour. What are you doing? What are you with you?
[9578.42s -> 9580.42s]  Are you hungry? I think he's hungry
[9580.98s -> 9584.57s]  You just went outside and now you're hungry
[9585.69s -> 9587.69s]  Hold on. I gotta feed him
[9587.69s -> 9593.58s]  We're pretty much at the end of the stream. So

[9613.10s -> 9614.86s]  Hold on. I'll be right back
[9614.86s -> 9901.05s]  Hopefully shit. He's back and he started playing the video without us
[9901.85s -> 9918.51s]  No, here we go. This is year of the rat and this will be the end of the stream

[10222.36s -> 10226.28s]  This fucking nice for a community to do to somebody I don't just want to blow through this
[10228.74s -> 10230.74s]  So what we're gonna do
[10230.82s -> 10232.82s]  Is I have a plan to finish

[10274.73s -> 10278.41s]  But one of those nights over the five days in a row that i'm going to stream we will do this
[10279.69s -> 10281.69s]  I just want to give it um

[10574.70s -> 10577.98s]  Well, uh in relationship well relationship wise
[10579.18s -> 10581.18s]  I don't have very much good advice to be honest
[10581.82s -> 10586.26s]  Because I I didn't I haven't really been part of too many relationships
[10586.90s -> 10591.45s]  And my tinder was kind of a joke. So I don't really have very many
[10592.01s -> 10594.33s]  much in good relationship advice to be honest with you
[10595.45s -> 10596.73s]  but
[10596.73s -> 10601.72s]  I'm, not sure how young you are. But if you're taking your act i'm assuming that you're fairly young
[10604.02s -> 10607.24s]  So don't worry. There's still plenty of people to meet
[10608.04s -> 10611.10s]  how many people to talk to
[10611.10s -> 10611.98s]  and
[10611.98s -> 10614.95s]  Hope you do well on that test

[10706.89s -> 10713.05s]  I met them in a stream. I was moderating when this game sequel came out and it's an all ages game. Not a baby game
[10714.57s -> 10718.89s]  I don't I I thought it was very good too. It was very charming. It was really fun. The characters are really cute
[10719.53s -> 10724.89s]  It's good. I just was asking in the very beginning if it was like a putt putt game. I didn't know
[10724.97s -> 10726.97s]  I just was asking the question. That's it
[10727.61s -> 10734.70s]  I just wanted to know
[10734.70s -> 10736.86s]  But it wasn't it was just fun. It was cute

[10754.62s -> 10759.74s]  I found out I have costochondritis and heard from a friend that you do too. Hope you feel better
[10761.27s -> 10763.27s]  That's the theory we have not
[10763.35s -> 10764.39s]  stamped
[10764.39s -> 10767.11s]  The actual diagnosis on that we'll probably figure that out tomorrow
[10767.75s -> 10770.71s]  Tomorrow is the day when I find out if that's what really is going on
[10771.35s -> 10775.77s]  But it seems like that's probably what it is and it's a pain in the ass
[10776.57s -> 10780.87s]  Thanks for the 300 bits. Thanks for watching frogs are the best

[10807.58s -> 10814.06s]  a world serving positive projections wherein you use your own personal mental and spiritual abilities to believe
[10814.54s -> 10818.06s]  And subsequently make true the things that you want to happen for yourself

[10837.38s -> 10839.14s]  What's wrong with it?
[10839.14s -> 10842.10s]  Just because it's in a crystal skull doesn't mean it's not good
[10842.74s -> 10849.18s]  I've heard it's good vodka. It I mean it tastes good. It tastes fine. It's okay

[11868.28s -> 11872.36s]  Okay, but like at least 20 at least 24 people bought a labo because of me
[11873.16s -> 11875.16s]  Come on, they're not gonna come out
[11882.56s -> 11884.56s]  They have to pay me to buy a labo
[11884.64s -> 11887.36s]  Don't don't say that say I bought one and it was fucking fun
[11890.84s -> 11893.00s]  Hey moo means moo. Thanks for another 500 bits
[11893.72s -> 11897.00s]  Those wipe effects you be you have between the different screens look clean as hell
[11897.48s -> 11900.84s]  Which is surprising is the concept of a clean wipe must be foreign to you
[11901.64s -> 11903.64s]  This joke wasn't worth 10
[11904.20s -> 11905.56s]  bucks
[11905.56s -> 11915.05s]  I don't know. What is that? What's that saying? I don't wipe my ass. I don't get it

[11936.16s -> 11939.36s]  I've had him too and it sucks. This is this is round two. It's really annoying
[11940.16s -> 11946.59s]  Back when I first had the colitis and Crohn's you've Crohn's you've colitis you have proctitis
[11947.13s -> 11950.09s]  When all that bullshit that went on five six seven straight years
[11951.13s -> 11954.97s]  And I finally figured it out and I've been all right with that. Here we go again round two
[11955.61s -> 11958.17s]  Oh now you have like chest and back pain like it's like
[11958.89s -> 11963.61s]  Internal pain. All right, who fucking knows what the hell it is. Good luck. See in three years when you find out
[11963.93s -> 11965.45s]  It's a pain in the ass
[11965.45s -> 11969.55s]  But you do what you gotta do
[11969.55s -> 11972.67s]  You do what you gotta do and you just try to figure it out. That's all you can do
[11973.55s -> 11983.29s]  I didn't realize you were having medical problems recently when I donated that no, it's all good. Don't worry
[11983.85s -> 11987.85s]  I'm fine. I'm doing just fine. If I wasn't fine, I wouldn't stream
[11988.97s -> 11994.17s]  If I was seriously in pain or if I was uncomfortable right now, I would not be live and you guys all know that
[11995.05s -> 11997.05s]  I hope that I've made that really clear
[11998.44s -> 12005.00s]  If I was not in if I was not having a good time and I'm not like forcing myself to turn a stream on trust me
[12006.12s -> 12011.24s]  Absolutely, not if it ever got there
[12012.04s -> 12016.28s]  I would take time off and you know, I would so don't worry about me. I'm gonna be just fine
[12023.93s -> 12026.41s]  I was under the impression that you shit your pants every single stream
[12027.13s -> 12029.88s]  Yeah, but that's completely unrelated
[12030.20s -> 12034.60s]  E word toward E word toward thanks for the 250. You better play halo 1 when it's released or you're getting banned
[12042.84s -> 12047.74s]  Halo. All right. All right. I'm gonna I have to play halo just by myself silently
[12049.12s -> 12055.69s]  Like maybe with on stream. I'm not gonna play it on legendary. I'm just gonna be silent and play it
[12056.49s -> 12062.99s]  I'm gonna bump you for a second here. Sorry about that. You all right
[12064.35s -> 12066.59s]  Let's see the credits going to come all the subs

[12070.91s -> 12075.47s]  There are almost 11 000 subs on the channel 11 fucking thousand subs, right?
[12076.59s -> 12077.55s]  that's

[12105.52s -> 12107.52s]  Hold on. I have to get this has to be corrected
[12108.08s -> 12114.16s]  I promised a halo reach stream and I played halo 2. I played halo reach with joe
[12114.64s -> 12119.84s]  It was one of the worst streams I ever did. I did I did play it and that was on one of the worst streams of 2019
[12120.96s -> 12129.02s]  That's what was voted. It was voted as one of the worst streams 2019. I liked that stream
[12129.66s -> 12137.77s]  But i'm sure the ceo of burger king thinks the chicken fries are good
[12138.70s -> 12140.22s]  So, I mean
