[1.02s -> 8.30s]  It was a little odd. For some reason my steam wouldn't connect. I had to like force quit it and then open it again.
[9.34s -> 10.78s]  Weird.
[10.78s -> 12.22s]  Anyways, hello.
[12.22s -> 26.18s]  Welcome back. I'm doing all right. I can't say I'm at 100% right now.
[26.82s -> 29.34s]  Because that would be a lie.
[29.34s -> 32.46s]  And you go ahead and make a new one. Dermal lied about being at 100%.
[33.26s -> 37.19s]  Because as the days progress here on this medication,
[37.99s -> 40.15s]  I feel like it's probably gonna get worse.
[43.83s -> 47.75s]  As we as we go forward over the next another five or six days.
[52.28s -> 61.37s]  Oh, end of the life. No, I'm fine. It's just
[64.28s -> 66.20s]  I'm I'm all right.
[66.20s -> 70.04s]  I can't this is one of those things you just can't talk about on stream and you just can't
[73.98s -> 76.65s]  just know
[76.65s -> 77.69s]  that
[77.69s -> 80.49s]  Like what the fuck? That's all you need to know.
[81.21s -> 86.81s]  But we're gonna continue our fear playthrough from yesterday.
[87.98s -> 90.30s]  I think we probably have an equal amount of time.
[92.20s -> 98.54s]  Left so I've been told this probably about four hours five hours maybe left in the game. We're just gonna do it today.
[106.26s -> 108.26s]  What happened? I missed it.
[108.26s -> 110.82s]  Uh, I guess i'll just talk about all right. Well
[111.86s -> 113.86s]  the nature of live broadcasting
[114.26s -> 116.26s]  and the nature of twitch and
[117.26s -> 122.86s]  Live stuff is people that were there yesterday may not be there tomorrow.
[123.34s -> 125.90s]  And the people that weren't there yesterday may be here today.
[128.07s -> 129.83s]  So it's um
[129.83s -> 133.83s]  That's people wonder why well, well you you've already talked about this like three times
[134.55s -> 136.15s]  well, it's because
[136.15s -> 141.19s]  You may not have been here two days ago. And if you were maybe your friend right there sitting at the table
[141.99s -> 145.64s]  May not have been here yesterday either
[145.72s -> 148.25s]  but um
[148.25s -> 150.25s]  Yeah, i'm on a couple of new medicines
[150.57s -> 153.05s]  i'm having some stomach issues that uh
[153.77s -> 156.17s]  I we think are completely unrelated
[156.81s -> 157.85s]  to
[157.85s -> 160.52s]  Uh, like colitis and stuff
[161.48s -> 165.56s]  So i'm trying some new stuff and what it does is it's causing me some discomfort
[166.52s -> 168.52s]  It discomfort in quotes
[170.89s -> 176.49s]  And I have to do it for a while. So the streams over the next week or so up until probably around halloween
[177.74s -> 179.58s]  Are gonna be shorter
[179.58s -> 181.58s]  But i'm gonna do more streams
[181.58s -> 187.42s]  That's pretty much the way it's gonna work. You're gonna get less time on stream, but you're gonna get more days streamed
[188.22s -> 192.09s]  There you go spread it around pass that around the lunchroom
[194.84s -> 197.08s]  And I don't really even need an intro here
[197.80s -> 206.60s]  Because we already know what's going on, but I do need to tweet something. So let me do that real quick
[211.37s -> 214.57s]  Spread the word
[214.65s -> 216.97s]  Well, don't spread don't spread it too much
[218.07s -> 220.39s]  Because it's not gonna be a it's not gonna be permanent
[221.11s -> 225.91s]  It's only gonna be for like a week or two
[227.62s -> 228.58s]  finishing
[228.58s -> 233.93s]  fear
[233.93s -> 235.93s]  I'm having a good time with this game though
[239.96s -> 241.96s]  If you didn't catch the stream yesterday
[243.80s -> 245.80s]  This is uh, this is a good one
[247.26s -> 253.18s]  And it really makes me want to play the other ones even though I know that i'm gonna be disappointed but still
[253.74s -> 257.90s]  It's the same company. It's the same franchise. Could it really be
[259.10s -> 260.30s]  worse
[260.30s -> 265.19s]  by that much
[265.19s -> 267.75s]  Two is all right. The three is the bad one
[269.67s -> 275.11s]  Fear two is all right fear two is fine. Okay, so fear three is not the same company monolith didn't do fear three
[275.67s -> 280.97s]  Okay. All right. All right
[280.97s -> 283.22s]  Fear two is good
[283.22s -> 287.18s]  All right, that's bad
[287.34s -> 289.02s]  I think I want to do them
[289.02s -> 292.70s]  Even if fear three sucks, you don't think we should do the three we don't believe we shouldn't do the trio
[295.00s -> 299.80s]  Well, I hate that game to a point where there's a meltdown on stream and I like quit the game halfway through. What do you think?
[300.52s -> 302.60s]  Is it not worth doing?
[302.60s -> 312.10s]  it may be
[312.10s -> 315.94s]  Never mind. You should play it. All right. Now we see where now we see where you're uh
[317.83s -> 319.99s]  Now we see where your true intentions lie
[322.17s -> 323.53s]  All right, let's go
[323.53s -> 325.11s]  Hi
[325.11s -> 327.85s]  Hi, it's me
[327.85s -> 329.93s]  So the last thing that happened
[329.93s -> 332.10s]  Let's break down the story here
[332.26s -> 334.10s]  scary girl
[334.10s -> 336.26s]  Find this guy
[336.26s -> 342.95s]  Kill that guy pretty fun game
[345.70s -> 349.30s]  Pretty much that's that's that's pretty much the plot of every horror game
[350.66s -> 352.26s]  All right, i'm going in
[352.26s -> 357.38s]  I I can't see anything you guys are saying. No fear three isn't a bad game. It's just not a good fear game
[357.46s -> 359.46s]  It's worth playing if you like fear one
[361.00s -> 362.70s]  We'll see
[362.70s -> 364.70s]  I should probably at least do fear two
[365.11s -> 367.11s]  But this I got all this stuff to do
[367.75s -> 369.75s]  There's a lot of games to play
[370.65s -> 372.81s]  All right, I apparently saved it
[373.45s -> 379.45s]  Where was I? Okay. Let me just check the audio level boom. That's really really loud for me, but it's probably all right for you
[380.49s -> 385.29s]  I can't tell is it really bad? All right play the expansions to fear one. All right
[386.42s -> 388.10s]  Maybe we'll do that too
[388.10s -> 392.33s]  Oh, I know why it's loud for me
[392.33s -> 399.42s]  Because I had to turn this up last night. Oh, it should be good for you
[400.30s -> 402.30s]  Check this out ready
[403.42s -> 405.42s]  That may have been too loud for you
[408.07s -> 411.32s]  Ow
[411.32s -> 413.32s]  Oh, i'm wasting ammo
[413.32s -> 418.26s]  Am I running?
[418.26s -> 421.40s]  Why am I not wait? Why am I going slow?
[422.12s -> 425.19s]  Oh, it's because i'm crouching. All right
[425.35s -> 429.67s]  Or how am I doing on health? Okay. I got how many health packs do I have?
[431.99s -> 435.75s]  The last thing I did. All right, right. Okay. I turned off the gas
[437.96s -> 439.96s]  from what I remember and then I
[440.12s -> 443.64s]  Yeah, no, I have to turn off the gas and then go up there
[444.68s -> 448.70s]  So the gas was over here
[448.70s -> 450.70s]  He didn't notice he was crouching
[452.44s -> 453.88s]  Yeah
[453.88s -> 459.74s]  Yeah, okay
[459.74s -> 461.82s]  All right. So this I went down but
[462.54s -> 464.54s]  No, this is why I came around
[466.65s -> 468.65s]  I didn't really pick the best place to stop
[472.25s -> 473.29s]  because
[473.29s -> 475.53s]  I kind of it's like i'm turned around here
[476.41s -> 480.57s]  I should have gotten the end of this section last night, but I just couldn't I couldn't do it
[485.06s -> 488.58s]  Does this take place after I didn't I turn it off already?
[489.30s -> 491.06s]  Did I pick the wrong save?
[491.06s -> 495.16s]  I may have picked the wrong save
[495.24s -> 504.09s]  What a chad
[504.09s -> 515.78s]  Really? I already got scared by this. Yeah. Yeah, I picked the wrong save
[517.85s -> 522.25s]  Like it's the wrong save that happened to me. Let me and do you remember what I said yesterday?
[522.25s -> 530.62s]  And I still feel the same way that ended the stream last night. That hurt me again
[531.50s -> 533.37s]  That was the one
[533.37s -> 535.37s]  Why did I pick this save?
[540.63s -> 542.63s]  No, I can't turn it off now
[546.97s -> 554.97s]  All right, where i'm fine. So that's turned off now. I'm gonna go up here. It hurt me it did
[560.50s -> 561.62s]  Keep out
[561.62s -> 566.15s]  I don't think it will
[566.15s -> 571.11s]  What the fuck is in here health facts health upgrade? All right. No, I don't want to go down
[574.47s -> 576.47s]  Wait charge up the flashlight
[582.04s -> 584.04s]  This is no, I need something with actual
[584.36s -> 586.60s]  What there's no I know no ammo in any of my guns
[592.44s -> 595.62s]  None of my weapons have ammo
[595.62s -> 598.34s]  Okay, so then now I can climb up the
[600.07s -> 603.35s]  Is this thing over here I can go through there or yeah, let's go through here
[604.15s -> 606.82s]  Because that's that
[606.82s -> 608.82s]  All right. Now I can go up the ladder
[609.56s -> 610.36s]  Oh
[610.36s -> 611.56s]  nice
[611.56s -> 616.86s]  Save it
[616.86s -> 619.16s]  Yeah, okay
[619.16s -> 627.08s]  This is where we stop
[627.08s -> 629.32s]  Yeah, I loaded the wrong safe. That's my bad. That's on me
[632.34s -> 633.86s]  This is the wrong safe
[633.86s -> 637.32s]  It's okay though. Don't worry because this is where this I remember
[638.44s -> 639.72s]  Stopping here
[639.72s -> 650.58s]  Let's go up
[650.58s -> 652.58s]  Uh, I guess we're gonna go over here
[653.83s -> 655.34s]  water
[655.34s -> 657.42s]  This is a water valve or is this a steam valve?
[658.14s -> 664.12s]  And I don't mean that I really don't mean that as a reference to any video game companies I actually mean like a
[664.76s -> 674.81s]  like a steamer
[674.89s -> 679.61s]  I I honestly did not mean that as like a that's this is a funny valve like valve joke
[680.17s -> 682.17s]  Like a company valve what is going on over here?
[683.37s -> 693.93s]  Okay, well the water's up
[693.93s -> 695.93s]  Am I killing somebody right now?
[701.74s -> 703.70s]  Yes
[703.70s -> 705.70s]  Oh, that was a good joke
[705.94s -> 708.86s]  Gay Ben
[708.86s -> 710.86s]  No, that's not what I was doing
[715.13s -> 716.25s]  Gay Ben
[716.25s -> 719.11s]  Remember when that was like the funniest thing you could possibly say
[719.91s -> 725.00s]  You might it still might be I don't know. Did I get everything in here?
[726.41s -> 730.63s]  Wait, hold on
[730.63s -> 732.95s]  Okay, what what year do you guys think?
[734.36s -> 735.88s]  had the best
[735.88s -> 737.45s]  memes
[737.45s -> 741.23s]  Do you think it was like 2011 2012 2013?
[742.01s -> 746.09s]  I think i'm missing something here
[746.79s -> 749.45s]  2012 started a lot of fucking weird stuff
[750.33s -> 753.54s]  Can I swim?
[753.54s -> 757.83s]  Okay, i'm just gonna swim
[757.89s -> 760.07s]  2010 to 2015 I would even say probably
[761.35s -> 765.35s]  I'm, not sure I would put I don't know if I'd go as far as 2015. That's a little too far. I think
[766.47s -> 777.43s]  Turn it on turn it off. Oh shit. I just turned it on
[779.42s -> 782.86s]  What like shitty design that is down is not on down is off
[783.96s -> 789.80s]  Up is on like a light switch. That's universal. That's like go that's driving on the right side of the road in
[790.36s -> 793.00s]  America or on the left side of the road in europe like come on
[795.78s -> 798.92s]  Up is on down is off
[802.06s -> 804.06s]  Well that I did that now I'm just gonna go back
[805.56s -> 808.81s]  They are hard to turn on
[808.81s -> 810.71s]  Oh, that's why
[810.71s -> 815.59s]  Because you need to like put weight down to turn it on. All right. I just thought it was right. Whatever you're right
[818.01s -> 825.45s]  Up is off loser
[825.45s -> 827.45s]  Here we go checkpoint
[828.42s -> 831.38s]  There's probably gonna be fucking monsters and shit here now so I could be ready
[839.29s -> 841.29s]  I can now go through the door the elevator
[843.80s -> 851.72s]  Oh
[851.72s -> 853.16s]  Somebody else
[853.16s -> 856.62s]  Who the fuck is here?
[861.43s -> 864.33s]  Oh
[864.33s -> 866.33s]  What is happening to this guy's head?
[876.15s -> 878.17s]  Save him
[878.17s -> 881.56s]  There is no saving that one
[881.56s -> 883.77s]  Okay. Now I can go
[883.77s -> 891.42s]  Uh, wait, I can actually I can use this right? What if I want to go two one?
[892.06s -> 894.42s]  Can I use? Oh, all right
[898.10s -> 899.54s]  Stop
[899.62s -> 910.14s]  Okay, just how do I all right they're gone
[919.74s -> 929.38s]  Okay, intercept
[929.38s -> 934.95s]  Uh, did the elevator did the elevator just open behind us? I don't know. I don't care. I
[938.18s -> 940.18s]  I just you exploded
[940.34s -> 942.34s]  Wait, did he what did he say?
[943.54s -> 945.54s]  You exploded
[945.62s -> 952.60s]  Oh shit, you exploded
[952.84s -> 955.02s]  Oh, no
[963.66s -> 966.87s]  Oh shit
[966.87s -> 968.87s]  This game is fucking so fun
[969.27s -> 972.07s]  Okay, here we go shotgun. I like the shotgun the best
[974.07s -> 980.54s]  Although this thing sucks. It really does. It's just not very good
[981.42s -> 983.22s]  The hell are you doing?
[983.22s -> 986.04s]  Pick it up
[986.04s -> 987.16s]  What are you?
[987.16s -> 988.44s]  Hey
[988.44s -> 993.86s]  Okay, 65. What do I have the heels might as well use one
[996.38s -> 1002.38s]  I feel like i've been completely just totally neglecting the pistols. I think I used it once in the first five minutes of the game
[1004.46s -> 1006.14s]  I feel kind of bad
[1007.03s -> 1012.33s]  You know what I mean? I feel like I wanted is it just bad
[1013.75s -> 1025.91s]  There's a lot of ammo and
[1026.15s -> 1027.59s]  That just scared me
[1027.59s -> 1029.11s]  All right, what's in here?
[1029.11s -> 1033.03s]  Anybody in here?
[1033.03s -> 1035.99s]  Okay, I don't know why my brain decided that this is what it was going to do
[1035.99s -> 1041.35s]  But I was going to hit control to see a hitman boom and look at points of interest
[1043.56s -> 1048.92s]  You know, it's it's the way that this looks this room is a hitman room. You know, you know, does that make any sense to anybody?
[1051.80s -> 1053.80s]  This is a hitman room
[1056.42s -> 1070.18s]  It it is that's why I wanted to do it it makes sense somebody's gonna be in here no computer computer
[1074.60s -> 1080.10s]  I was gonna close all the one but
[1080.18s -> 1082.18s]  I decided that was not worth my time
[1083.22s -> 1085.22s]  Look out. It's getting it's high voltage
[1085.46s -> 1094.23s]  Should I
[1094.23s -> 1100.73s]  That's new music
[1100.73s -> 1102.58s]  Oh
[1102.58s -> 1104.66s]  It's the human garfield. I forgot. All right
[1109.74s -> 1113.74s]  I love how human garfield has his own jokey like fairy tale music
[1120.38s -> 1131.21s]  Christ I thought I was a goner to you guys. The elevators are offline and those soldiers are everywhere
[1131.35s -> 1134.63s]  Feed him should I feed him security office and override the lockdown?
[1136.01s -> 1141.32s]  All right, let's feed him
[1141.56s -> 1144.76s]  That didn't feed him
[1145.24s -> 1147.24s]  He eats
[1152.01s -> 1164.12s]  Nobody move he usually eats him remember oops. Oh my god, he's just wearing a hat
[1178.81s -> 1182.09s]  Dude the whole the whole building just went up
[1190.38s -> 1192.38s]  Okay. Well, that was fun
[1195.54s -> 1199.06s]  override the security lockdown
[1199.14s -> 1201.14s]  You created a black hole
[1201.78s -> 1204.34s]  Somehow accidentally. All right, I got my shotgun
[1205.72s -> 1207.72s]  Yes, I did think that was a person for a second
[1208.90s -> 1212.34s]  It's a horror game. Come on. It's hard to not think the shadow is a monster
[1217.03s -> 1222.95s]  imagine getting hit right in the face by a absolutely more than eight to ten pound weight and just
[1223.99s -> 1226.07s]  Going like this
[1226.07s -> 1228.07s]  without even flinching
[1236.07s -> 1238.07s]  What a true chad
[1239.72s -> 1241.88s]  Uh, no guys, no
[1249.69s -> 1250.41s]  Oh
[1250.41s -> 1284.06s]  What's in there? Wait
[1285.82s -> 1287.90s]  I fucked up his toaster. Sorry
[1290.76s -> 1296.14s]  What somebody open the door?
[1296.14s -> 1298.30s]  No, that's a waste of a grenade. Come back
[1309.34s -> 1364.06s]  Saves come. Yeah. Let's try and see if it was good could contain the blast
[1364.06s -> 1366.86s]  Just
[1378.55s -> 1388.49s]  Okay, we already heard it so
[1389.37s -> 1392.41s]  Where is this security room then through here?
[1398.26s -> 1403.94s]  Somebody's gonna that guy getting eaten eaten in one of these he's gonna come somebody's gonna fall out of one of these
[1404.42s -> 1406.42s]  A monster or something a new enemy type
[1406.90s -> 1410.18s]  It's just completely and totally absolute
[1410.74s -> 1420.22s]  Oh shit
[1420.22s -> 1422.78s]  Good work
[1422.78s -> 1424.78s]  That guy was very unsure
[1452.70s -> 1453.58s]  What?
[1453.58s -> 1455.58s]  Wait, what is going on?
[1457.86s -> 1460.10s]  So I threw
[1461.91s -> 1476.20s]  I frisbeed in to the room. They couldn't see me. I they didn't they didn't know where I was quick
[1510.63s -> 1512.94s]  All right, I need uh
[1512.94s -> 1556.26s]  Where is he stop talk sit all clear. I didn't where was he? I don't even hear it
[1556.82s -> 1562.50s]  I want to stick this on one of his like butt cheeks
[1563.78s -> 1573.86s]  It's so important the music the music is
[1578.14s -> 1583.08s]  What
[1583.08s -> 1584.57s]  Okay
[1584.57s -> 1599.43s]  Uh, all right. I got him was he uh, that's cool. All right, but who cares?
[1600.23s -> 1610.34s]  I had to reload the fucking gun
[1619.83s -> 1623.35s]  That thing actually is not very good
[1623.35s -> 1626.31s]  It's not not very good. You have to shoot him like three times in the head
[1627.21s -> 1629.69s]  Just only use the shotgun. It's the best weapon in the whole game
[1654.62s -> 1656.70s]  Was that guy shooting at him?
[1657.86s -> 1663.88s]  I think he was shooting at him. I have no idea
[1664.44s -> 1671.61s]  That guy was on my team
[1673.02s -> 1674.30s]  He could have been
[1674.30s -> 1685.99s]  I'm stuck
[1685.99s -> 1687.99s]  How do they not see me that whole time?
[1696.65s -> 1698.65s]  He's trying to flank
[1698.89s -> 1701.45s]  He's running straight at me. He's flanking us
[1704.49s -> 1707.30s]  shit
[1707.30s -> 1709.22s]  I'm never gonna be able to
[1709.22s -> 1711.22s]  Hear them say that and not laugh at it
[1712.76s -> 1714.50s]  That's shit
[1714.50s -> 1720.42s]  What i'm looking for is i'm looking for three people in the same room four people and it's oh shit. Oh shit
[1720.90s -> 1722.42s]  Oh shit
[1722.42s -> 1724.42s]  I want to hear it four times in a row
[1724.82s -> 1727.88s]  That's the only thing I want what the fuck is that
[1728.52s -> 1738.22s]  There's a rocket launcher
[1738.22s -> 1744.06s]  I want to have five people in a room rocket launch explode. Oh shit explode. Oh shit
[1744.46s -> 1746.46s]  I want the pitch to keep going down
[1747.26s -> 1750.62s]  That'd be the ultimate video game laugh out loud moment for me
[1751.58s -> 1756.34s]  All right, let's go
[1756.34s -> 1762.55s]  Save it
[1762.55s -> 1764.55s]  We got two in a row
[1764.55s -> 1766.55s]  Can we get like four in a row?
[1768.65s -> 1771.45s]  Oh, uh, it's gonna take just dice thrown in the air
[1772.25s -> 1780.23s]  it's
[1780.23s -> 1782.97s]  What it's
[1782.97s -> 1794.33s]  You shoot three
[1794.33s -> 1796.33s]  Okay, this is too good to use right now
[1806.28s -> 1808.68s]  It's just it's I don't want to use this. It's too good
[1809.64s -> 1819.29s]  I wasted it. I know that's all right, though
[1820.81s -> 1825.30s]  I'll get more ammo for it and I will only use it. I thought it was a one shot. That's why
[1826.02s -> 1835.02s]  It's still open
[1835.02s -> 1840.81s]  What the fuck? Hello? Oh you
[1841.69s -> 1859.82s]  You're down there
[1859.82s -> 1861.18s]  No, no
[1861.18s -> 1867.06s]  Oh shit, nice throw. Oh shit
[1875.51s -> 1877.51s]  Why are you holding the gun like that?
[1896.52s -> 1899.02s]  Okay, I guess i'll take it
[1899.26s -> 1906.81s]  I know I can get in there. I'll get this way
[1910.68s -> 1925.00s]  Security room. Here we go. He performed final acrobatics before he died
[1937.37s -> 1945.86s]  Yes, i'm still on hard. Okay. Here we go. Who's coming in?
[1950.81s -> 1954.25s]  It's gonna why would you have the monitor here? It's gonna be a scary thing that runs by
[1956.89s -> 1959.18s]  Apparently not
[1959.18s -> 1969.15s]  All right, everything is been activated now we have to go back you can leave through here. All right, it's done
[1974.68s -> 1986.80s]  Nope, that is not gonna fucking happen 14 35 43
[2006.22s -> 2013.90s]  Dammit
[2026.42s -> 2028.42s]  It's got to be the detonate one
[2036.73s -> 2039.40s]  No
[2039.40s -> 2046.70s]  I have to do this once
[2047.82s -> 2057.03s]  It didn't I didn't even get it in
[2061.56s -> 2063.56s]  You motherfucker, I swear to god
[2069.75s -> 2092.86s]  There it's in
[2093.66s -> 2095.10s]  No
[2095.10s -> 2107.34s]  Quick run around to every floor and hit quick sprint up press every button on every floor on the way down running down the stairs
[2108.86s -> 2125.11s]  That'll fuck him. Why do I keep trusting that guy? That guy just disappears. He doesn't do anything else
[2125.19s -> 2128.26s]  He just runs away. All right
[2128.26s -> 2137.69s]  I was already in here. This is the way to go to where I just was so didn't know the door open
[2139.19s -> 2143.42s]  I'm certain that another door opened and then he turned off
[2143.98s -> 2149.06s]  That's so annoying
[2149.06s -> 2152.04s]  Can I even go over here? Oh shit
[2152.60s -> 2155.99s]  I do I have to meet him upstairs
[2162.66s -> 2172.84s]  Oh god. Dammit. I do
[2172.84s -> 2181.32s]  This come on. There's not a health upgrade here. Why would you have this here if there wasn't an upgrade? That's total
[2182.02s -> 2183.16s]  bullshit
[2183.16s -> 2189.83s]  What just happened? There's no cool music right now
[2190.63s -> 2208.20s]  I know what the fuck is a great
[2216.62s -> 2217.98s]  Seeing what happened
[2217.98s -> 2227.72s]  All right, we made it
[2227.72s -> 2237.03s]  Game saved. What's next? Sayonara sucker
[2244.10s -> 2251.61s]  It's very very quiet. That means something's gonna jump out. That's audio editing 101
[2255.99s -> 2257.99s]  Make the audience have to focus
[2258.47s -> 2263.19s]  On the fact that there's no audio go. Wait, why is it no then loud noise?
[2263.75s -> 2272.70s]  It doesn't open this looks like it's on
[2282.98s -> 2284.98s]  Perfect you again
[2285.38s -> 2288.58s]  Yeah
[2295.50s -> 2299.50s]  You almost didn't fit through the door you almost didn't fit through the door I get the last lap
[2300.22s -> 2319.93s]  Can I destroy it? Let's just hide
[2321.83s -> 2341.35s]  Why is that in here? Why does that exist?
[2344.41s -> 2351.42s]  Yo, you left you cactus. I don't think he cares. All right, so let's uh go in here
[2354.15s -> 2358.36s]  No, no
[2358.36s -> 2367.24s]  Jesus
[2367.24s -> 2371.96s]  So I can't go this way now. There's no make sure don't miss this like no what the fuck's happening
[2372.84s -> 2384.73s]  Okay, go back. Okay. Well
[2385.45s -> 2389.29s]  uh
[2389.29s -> 2391.29s]  It's a retro stream
[2394.76s -> 2399.14s]  Uh-oh
[2399.14s -> 2404.98s]  Why why yeah, why is my why is my bit rate so low right now? These graphics suck
[2409.93s -> 2413.11s]  Why is this happening?
[2413.11s -> 2415.29s]  Oh, I think I have a setting
[2415.29s -> 2418.01s]  I think there's a new setting on like on obs now
[2418.81s -> 2433.08s]  Where if you if your internet sucks, it doesn't drop frames it drops your bit rate. I wonder this that's interesting
[2437.00s -> 2439.32s]  It's 2007 all over again
[2442.74s -> 2447.46s]  That's better. Yeah, it was like a it was like a pretty revolutionary thing that they were working on
[2447.62s -> 2449.94s]  I remember I talked to somebody at twitchcon about it
[2452.22s -> 2454.62s]  But the real question is how long I wonder
[2455.26s -> 2457.26s]  Do we just kind of slowly come back?
[2459.80s -> 2463.64s]  Um, let me just do one thing. Let me just look at this real quick. I want to see if this is actually
[2464.44s -> 2468.54s]  If that's what's actually happening. I saved it. Hold on. Let me just check something
[2472.49s -> 2477.88s]  That's very very cool
[2477.88s -> 2479.88s]  Let me just see if that's what it's doing
[2482.63s -> 2490.01s]  maybe
[2490.01s -> 2492.01s]  Because this is for as happening in like real time
[2492.65s -> 2507.32s]  This is so strange
[2507.32s -> 2509.88s]  I didn't think this was on any of the other obs's though
[2515.10s -> 2517.10s]  Because I don't think this is enabled
[2517.34s -> 2522.07s]  What what's this link you guys are spamming?
[2523.27s -> 2525.27s]  That's what this looked like
[2527.22s -> 2529.38s]  Oh my god
[2529.46s -> 2531.46s]  That looked like I made it a clay
[2536.47s -> 2540.25s]  I think that is what's happening though
[2540.25s -> 2542.25s]  You know, i'm just gonna say that's what's happening
[2542.57s -> 2547.61s]  And we're just gonna go back to playing the game because it looks like it's climbing back to like four or five six thousand now
[2550.07s -> 2554.97s]  interesting
[2554.97s -> 2562.52s]  What did it hit?
[2562.52s -> 2565.88s]  Dude, that is a that is an amazing feature that they came up with though. That's that's
[2566.50s -> 2568.50s]  insanely awesome
[2568.50s -> 2572.34s]  Because like you won't your stream won't turn the fuck off anymore
[2579.00s -> 2582.76s]  That's so awesome
[2582.76s -> 2586.04s]  Thank god for smart people making smart things in technology
[2586.92s -> 2588.12s]  all right
[2588.12s -> 2593.32s]  This is actually the the the bit rate that I used to stream at I used to stream at this exact bit rate at like
[2593.78s -> 2594.84s]  4,800
[2594.84s -> 2600.62s]  So this is like this is actually uh, twitch.tv slash germa985 from like 2016
[2601.08s -> 2604.23s]  2015
[2604.23s -> 2608.07s]  Can I activate it?
[2608.07s -> 2610.94s]  Why can I not turn that on?
[2610.94s -> 2613.98s]  Warning video cameras are operating on these premises good
[2614.62s -> 2617.30s]  Automatic
[2621.38s -> 2627.43s]  How could you tell
[2627.43s -> 2629.43s]  All right. I'm going for this is what these are for
[2642.12s -> 2644.12s]  Excuse me, excuse me
[2644.94s -> 2650.01s]  I
[2650.01s -> 2661.91s]  Huh? What?
[2661.91s -> 2664.47s]  Never mind. Those things suck
[2664.47s -> 2667.19s]  I can't even see where this thing is now. Where did it blow up?
[2679.64s -> 2682.65s]  That was that was
[2682.97s -> 2684.97s]  I can't I can't save scum. Just go
[2686.46s -> 2695.86s]  There's too many health packs
[2695.86s -> 2698.81s]  Okay, so
[2698.81s -> 2703.85s]  See what we do here on germa985 was we make sure that we show everybody our best and our worst
[2703.85s -> 2706.79s]  This is the mario tennis stream
[2706.79s -> 2707.03s]  All right
[2707.03s -> 2708.07s]  We started out all right
[2708.07s -> 2713.51s]  And then I started like swearing at people and making fun of people on mario tennis and everybody really hated it and it went right
[2713.51s -> 2716.39s]  Down, but I want to make sure everyone knows that we don't do that shit
[2716.87s -> 2720.71s]  We show the worst that we have but we also show the fucking big recoveries that we have too
[2722.94s -> 2725.02s]  This is from the tony hawk pro skater 2 stream
[2725.74s -> 2729.58s]  Where I was playing really poorly and everybody was like making fun of me and everyone made fun of me
[2729.74s -> 2733.82s]  And then I pulled off a one million point trick and made a ton of great jokes in a row
[2734.38s -> 2736.46s]  You can always salvage it. Don't throw it away
[2737.26s -> 2742.55s]  and then this one is uh
[2742.55s -> 2745.91s]  That that one's tesla. I just I just always want to keep track of it because I trade it
[2746.79s -> 2761.56s]  Okay, so
[2761.56s -> 2764.52s]  No, i'm not doing any chin faces anymore because I know how bad I look
[2768.36s -> 2779.11s]  Don't die
[2794.01s -> 2796.89s]  I'm doing curve at the frog. Why won't these explode?
[2797.61s -> 2812.41s]  Pull them next to it. Well, what the what it shouldn't explode
[2812.97s -> 2815.34s]  I need more health now
[2815.34s -> 2831.99s]  I have a click saved about five minutes. I'm supposed to make a macro for that
[2833.10s -> 2836.06s]  I'm supposed to make a macro for every time I throw a grenade. It saves the game
[2836.70s -> 2842.01s]  Okay, uh, let's go that way
[2848.22s -> 2853.19s]  Right electricity off. There we go. Oh, no, I don't like that
[2854.34s -> 2856.34s]  No more turrets
[2857.11s -> 2858.47s]  That's a good thing
[2858.47s -> 2866.60s]  Does that let me open the doors? No
[2871.86s -> 2873.86s]  Okay, I think what three hours have gone by
[2874.42s -> 2875.70s]  in-game
[2875.70s -> 2880.87s]  No, none of these open
[2880.87s -> 2885.70s]  That just turned off the turrets. That's it didn't do anything else
[2887.67s -> 2890.47s]  That's that nothing else here. All right, i'm gonna go this way
[2894.82s -> 2896.82s]  Maybe now I can keep going
[2896.90s -> 2899.38s]  further through uh, what's this way
[2899.94s -> 2903.32s]  Could go that way. I'll go up
[2903.32s -> 2904.92s]  We're down. No, i'll go down
[2904.92s -> 2912.70s]  I haven't been over here yet
[2912.70s -> 2915.34s]  health upgrade
[2915.34s -> 2920.23s]  No, germ is so smart. He can see time
[2923.32s -> 2925.32s]  Um, I can't see time
[2925.48s -> 2928.92s]  I can see the system that we have created as humans
[2930.04s -> 2932.04s]  To be aware of its passing
[2933.48s -> 2935.24s]  There's a difference
[2935.24s -> 2937.24s]  I turned it off. I turned it off
[2937.72s -> 2945.46s]  Am I missing? Oh god, i'm in trouble
[2947.14s -> 2948.98s]  I'm just
[2948.98s -> 2960.94s]  Did I get it? I thought I turned this shit off
[2962.09s -> 2963.69s]  Just throw a grenade
[2963.69s -> 2968.43s]  What do you mean just throw a grenade? The last two times i've thrown a grenade into it. They've magically disappeared
[2969.74s -> 2973.02s]  A regular grenade would bounce off of it and come back and kill me
[2974.57s -> 2977.85s]  I can't use the rockets because I I might need it for something
[2980.28s -> 2982.40s]  like this
[2982.40s -> 2985.79s]  Like this scenario. This is the scenario
[2996.17s -> 2998.09s]  Is this what hackers do?
[2998.09s -> 3003.42s]  When they put like this is like pulling up to a red light next to a guy in a Lamborghini. Is it like
[3005.85s -> 3008.78s]  All right. You ready? Let's go fine
[3015.93s -> 3018.49s]  What's he doing? Is he in yet?
[3026.43s -> 3030.83s]  I hope I I hope I can just push this guy off like an edge. You know what I mean?
[3031.80s -> 3034.84s]  I don't want to like kill this guy. I just want to push him over like a cliff
[3035.64s -> 3042.17s]  Maybe kill him probably maybe
[3044.88s -> 3046.96s]  I can't activate that. So let's just go
[3048.36s -> 3050.84s]  Wait one two secrets
[3051.48s -> 3058.33s]  Remember that kills people
[3058.89s -> 3060.89s]  Well, it depends. I don't know
[3061.05s -> 3062.65s]  There's a difference
[3062.65s -> 3066.17s]  A click guys a kind of pushing somebody over an edge off a cliff
[3066.73s -> 3068.09s]  could mean
[3068.09s -> 3070.89s]  like on the top of a playground slide or
[3071.37s -> 3074.25s]  Like grand canyon, you know what I mean? It's off the edge
[3074.89s -> 3077.05s]  I just want to push him off a slide. That's what I meant
[3083.84s -> 3089.40s]  That's a slide not a cliff. Oh, we could argue semantics here
[3089.96s -> 3095.93s]  What is a cliff? What could it be? Like what is an edge? What is like a pushing somebody off of off an edge mean?
[3096.89s -> 3099.29s]  Cliff is a well cliff is not a man-made
[3105.28s -> 3107.28s]  Why is he running around?
[3108.72s -> 3111.76s]  I don't understand what this guy's game is. There's people
[3112.32s -> 3119.36s]  There's like a whole agency of of weird super soldiers that are killing us and trying to kill everybody and there's
[3119.92s -> 3123.36s]  All this awful shit going on. There's a little scary girl
[3123.92s -> 3126.24s]  and
[3126.24s -> 3132.00s]  Why is he running away from me?
[3132.16s -> 3135.68s]  Let me ask a question. It's been like six hours in the game. Can you cook grenades?
[3141.58s -> 3143.00s]  Yes
[3143.00s -> 3145.66s]  No
[3145.66s -> 3158.32s]  We're about to find out
[3158.32s -> 3159.60s]  You cannot
[3159.60s -> 3161.60s]  Otherwise this would have exploded
[3165.13s -> 3173.45s]  So we're just gonna have to use this thing
[3173.85s -> 3185.52s]  Here we go
[3185.52s -> 3186.88s]  Still there
[3186.88s -> 3196.49s]  Is it gone? Oh my god, and he's six rockets
[3200.17s -> 3202.17s]  Well, that's unfortunate. I can't open this
[3211.58s -> 3221.82s]  No, no easter egg to get a soda. I get to I get to push him over an edge
[3221.82s -> 3223.66s]  I get to push him down the cliff
[3223.66s -> 3225.47s]  I get to do that
[3225.47s -> 3230.99s]  I am gonna he's gonna say his last line and i'm gonna push him down the laundry chute. I get to do what i've wanted
[3231.95s -> 3233.63s]  I get to do it
[3233.63s -> 3249.08s]  I can't wait
[3249.08s -> 3263.90s]  Oh, come on. He made it in wonderful. I don't get to do my fun thing that I wanted to do so bad
[3268.70s -> 3280.72s]  That's very disappointing. Let's take a look over here anything that's over here that I need to do
[3282.44s -> 3303.93s]  Oh shit, just hold on. Yeah, he's stuck in that vent
[3306.88s -> 3311.76s]  Just fill that thing with chocolate syrup and you got the first half of the Willy Wonka movie
[3312.40s -> 3320.67s]  All right, that's good
[3320.67s -> 3322.67s]  Just open the fucking vent
[3330.72s -> 3331.68s]  Wait
[3331.68s -> 3340.04s]  Why are these here?
[3341.24s -> 3345.00s]  Okay
[3345.00s -> 3387.82s]  All right, that's gone
[3387.82s -> 3395.37s]  I think i'm by it by this point
[3395.93s -> 3399.48s]  How are you still aiming down here? What?
[3400.20s -> 3403.53s]  Well, that's a that's a crock of shit
[3409.36s -> 3411.60s]  No
[3411.60s -> 3413.68s]  Here comes a jupiter storm
[3413.68s -> 3431.93s]  Watch out left or right. Uh, let's go right first right looked shorter. Good call
[3435.08s -> 3436.19s]  Uh-oh
[3436.19s -> 3439.00s]  Um, is it one of those things?
[3451.23s -> 3453.95s]  You love cocaine
[3453.95s -> 3456.35s]  I would advise on not doing that anymore
[3459.21s -> 3461.93s]  I don't think it's not very good for you. I would not do that anymore
[3467.26s -> 3472.76s]  Clip that yeah
[3472.76s -> 3474.76s]  I would advise on not doing any
[3475.16s -> 3478.28s]  Thing like that. It's not good for you. It's not good for you
[3479.28s -> 3481.76s]  Eat a fucking banana. Okay, eat a banana
[3500.60s -> 3502.60s]  What did he just jump out of the ceiling?
[3512.46s -> 3514.92s]  He did
[3514.92s -> 3516.92s]  Roger. Oh, no, that was roger
[3517.32s -> 3521.21s]  That was one of his friends
[3541.18s -> 3544.46s]  I have one bullet left in this thing. Um, I need a new gun
[3545.58s -> 3552.24s]  I'm in trouble here
[3557.36s -> 3562.46s]  What all right, I'm I have one health pack left
[3563.02s -> 3577.00s]  Where'd it go? Good
[3577.00s -> 3579.40s]  Uh any other ammo or anything? I need a new gun
[3585.93s -> 3591.85s]  Ooh, perfect a boost to my reaction speed thing
[3592.57s -> 3613.10s]  Turn the flashlight off. There's probably more
[3613.10s -> 3633.37s]  Um, was he destroying one of those turrets? Got him
[3650.88s -> 3656.30s]  Any more kill that light?
[3656.30s -> 3662.04s]  All right. I have to replace the I gotta replace the no this thing replace this
[3662.28s -> 3666.52s]  I don't the nail gun isn't really that good. It takes too much
[3666.52s -> 3669.08s]  Even if you headshot it takes like three headshots sometimes
[3669.72s -> 3671.29s]  That's too much
[3671.29s -> 3672.97s]  It should be two one
[3672.97s -> 3691.10s]  So this is now I can use this not yet. I will be using it though to go up or down
[3705.87s -> 3716.73s]  Wait a minute. He can shoot through the glass. Okay. Give me some weapons here
[3717.21s -> 3719.96s]  This thing doesn't come into this room, right?
[3727.34s -> 3740.40s]  Where is he?
[3740.40s -> 3743.76s]  Holy
[3743.76s -> 3764.11s]  Oh
[3785.96s -> 3787.96s]  Come on get in here
[3787.96s -> 3791.29s]  I can pick him up. I can pick him up. I can pick him up
[3797.16s -> 3799.18s]  Here's the plan
[3799.18s -> 3808.32s]  You ready for the plan? Okay, pull him over here put a gigantic trap for him
[3808.88s -> 3811.64s]  He i'm gonna pull him into this room
[3811.64s -> 3814.56s]  He's gonna be all the way back here
[3814.56s -> 3818.40s]  Get this out a gigantic trap. This guy is fucking dead
[3819.20s -> 3822.32s]  There he is. Okay. How are you? Good to see you
[3823.47s -> 3833.18s]  Now you're dead
[3833.18s -> 3834.38s]  See you in hell
[3834.38s -> 3862.54s]  Now why is the music still going?
[3882.40s -> 3884.16s]  All right, I guess i'm out of here
[3884.16s -> 3891.88s]  It wasn't even hard. It just took all of my stuff. Wait this ammo
[3892.52s -> 3908.04s]  I mean, I'm going this is the last the final boss is up here. That's where i'm going. That's a specific noise
[3909.00s -> 3911.00s]  that little like
[3912.06s -> 3925.55s]  What is that from? I don't know. It's
[3926.19s -> 3928.03s]  Oh, it's gonna kill me
[3928.03s -> 3932.19s]  It's from mario 64
[3932.35s -> 3934.19s]  No, it's not is it really?
[3934.19s -> 3945.63s]  Okay
[3945.63s -> 3947.87s]  Good. I have a hundred now
[3947.95s -> 3949.95s]  100 armor save it
[3950.59s -> 3964.22s]  What's in here another one of those things?
[3964.22s -> 3970.81s]  That's you're probably gonna have to fight like a few of them. Wait. All right. I haven't been in here yet
[3971.82s -> 3972.78s]  Right
[3972.78s -> 3979.77s]  There it is
[3979.77s -> 3986.84s]  No
[3986.84s -> 3988.92s]  Why did I not break that? I should have fucking known
[3990.54s -> 3992.99s]  Really?
[3992.99s -> 3995.47s]  That's the point. That's why i'm doing this see
[3996.65s -> 3998.65s]  Because I know that I was there
[4008.22s -> 4015.45s]  All right, we got water. Let's go given the game is too scary. Please change it
[4016.51s -> 4020.51s]  Nah, this is nah, it's not it's not that bad. It's scary but
[4021.07s -> 4034.64s]  Nah ready? It's gonna go
[4037.98s -> 4040.86s]  Do it do it
[4042.97s -> 4044.97s]  Come on. I'm really off with these predictions today
[4049.21s -> 4053.63s]  Amnesia is better than this. Well, I mean this is not like a it's not supposed
[4060.86s -> 4062.27s]  Okay
[4062.27s -> 4067.31s]  This is like a shooter game though. That's I mean, it's it. Hey, you don't you can't talk smack about fear
[4069.77s -> 4072.65s]  I'm this is like a really cool game. I really like this game
[4074.46s -> 4076.46s]  And it's like scary, but this is
[4077.02s -> 4079.10s]  This old it's not like brand new
[4091.12s -> 4094.64s]  See omega lull omega lull l cool
[4098.17s -> 4102.17s]  I actually really like this game. I think it's really good. I think it still holds up
[4103.53s -> 4105.29s]  This many years later
[4105.29s -> 4107.29s]  Is it toxic gas in here too?
[4115.55s -> 4117.55s]  Why would you have a button to press that does that
[4122.38s -> 4160.06s]  Is bill back down there? Okay, you might be getting a call from bill. He's a fucking asshole
[4161.26s -> 4177.98s]  Ask you guys a serious question
[4177.98s -> 4184.70s]  What was the last time you left or listened to a voice mail?
[4185.26s -> 4197.76s]  What's the last time you left a voicemail? It's been a while. I think
[4199.58s -> 4203.58s]  Everybody knows that nobody checks their voicemails. So nobody leaves voicemails
[4204.38s -> 4209.50s]  Every time I get to a point where I really need to tell somebody something. I got to talk to this person
[4211.29s -> 4214.49s]  By the time I leave a voicemail for you if you're not available right now
[4214.89s -> 4220.01s]  I'm just gonna text you and i'll i'll you'll see that first before you'll listen to a voicemail
[4221.58s -> 4223.58s]  voicemail is is really just
[4224.83s -> 4226.83s]  As you know, I don't have a reason to do it
[4227.61s -> 4233.21s]  I think like maybe if you like call the doctor or something to like leave but even still you just call again
[4233.29s -> 4237.05s]  You call like at 8 a.m. The next morning and y'all you get through to somebody
[4237.61s -> 4245.80s]  I don't really leave them anymore
[4245.80s -> 4252.01s]  And I don't listen to them either
[4252.09s -> 4254.67s]  Somebody could literally leave me a voicemail
[4255.53s -> 4257.31s]  that says
[4257.31s -> 4259.31s]  Uh, mr. Albertson, this is
[4259.47s -> 4264.62s]  Uh free money giveaway incorporated. We have a check with your name on it. There's no quit
[4264.70s -> 4269.26s]  Literally, this is no questions asked you get a million dollars if you just call me back
[4269.90s -> 4271.02s]  This I that's it
[4271.02s -> 4273.98s]  It's just a full taxed one lump set payment
[4274.38s -> 4279.82s]  And it's there's three doctors and two scientists in the room to make sure it's legit and a police officer and a tax attorney
[4280.06s -> 4283.52s]  Police call me back within seven days and you'll get it and I I wouldn't get it
[4289.26s -> 4293.26s]  I would get that voicemail if that voicemail was left, uh, like yesterday
[4293.82s -> 4295.82s]  I would listen to that voicemail
[4296.57s -> 4297.45s]  in
[4297.45s -> 4299.45s]  July of 2020
[4299.45s -> 4303.45s]  When I go through and delete every voicemail that's saved in my iphone
[4310.92s -> 4312.92s]  Check now what if it's there?
[4313.61s -> 4316.41s]  Well, it's too late. Anyways, if it's there. No, it's too late. Anyways
[4320.33s -> 4322.41s]  Check now. No, I definitely don't have one
[4324.14s -> 4327.90s]  See now a great joke for this stream if I had thought about that beforehand
[4328.38s -> 4334.54s]  Was to have a voicemail on my phone of that what I just told you and it's like at the end it says
[4334.94s -> 4336.94s]  end of message received on
[4337.74s -> 4338.78s]  may
[4338.78s -> 4340.12s]  12
[4340.12s -> 4343.64s]  2018
[4343.64s -> 4354.00s]  Oh, well, all right. Let me let me make sure I got everything that I need here. I've full everything
[4354.56s -> 4359.56s]  I don't think there's anything else in here. So i'm going to go the way that I'm supposed to go this way
[4372.14s -> 4374.22s]  And here this would be an even funnier thing to do
[4374.70s -> 4380.62s]  Is have that voicemail a different version of it like six or seven different times over the course of like a full year
[4385.37s -> 4387.37s]  Like I had a really good chance
[4389.10s -> 4393.53s]  Stop stop what missed lore?
[4396.96s -> 4400.35s]  This is scary girl and you're in the facility there
[4402.25s -> 4410.60s]  Pitch that around
[4410.60s -> 4412.20s]  Look, I won't miss this
[4412.20s -> 4415.66s]  It's not even in there. I don't want that
[4416.62s -> 4419.96s]  Uh, is this where the here we go. Where are they?
[4422.17s -> 4423.69s]  Wait, am I gonna
[4423.69s -> 4425.69s]  I'm not gonna like poison them. Am I?
[4426.67s -> 4441.31s]  Oh, I
[4441.31s -> 4451.80s]  Do they know where it is?
[4451.80s -> 4455.07s]  Who are these people?
[4455.07s -> 4457.71s]  It's a turret. Don't come in the room with the
[4463.04s -> 4465.44s]  Why would you go in the room with the turret?
[4468.70s -> 4470.70s]  Oh shoot. It's a turret in there
[4471.58s -> 4474.86s]  Everybody go in everybody running at the same time
[4490.83s -> 4501.71s]  No, you won't
[4509.44s -> 4512.67s]  Yeah, yeah
[4512.67s -> 4524.48s]  Who where?
[4524.48s -> 4526.17s]  It's a turret
[4526.17s -> 4528.17s]  There's a turret in there
[4528.17s -> 4533.37s]  What's with the cactus? I feel like this isn't a cactus theme
[4533.93s -> 4544.27s]  In this uh game. Okay, what about down here? What?
[4566.51s -> 4573.98s]  All right, but who was this did somebody fall off
[4574.94s -> 4577.34s]  And they're just like oh, oh well resume patrol
[4579.34s -> 4583.18s]  These guys know these guys aren't on the same team. Okay, that's good to know
[4583.90s -> 4591.07s]  Any secrets?
[4591.07s -> 4602.84s]  What the hell is the atc doing? Okay. Let's sneak around up here
[4602.84s -> 4606.28s]  A lot of ammo gonna be up there definitely put up the shotgun again. It's best weapons
[4607.48s -> 4609.53s]  You heard my gun
[4609.53s -> 4615.36s]  You didn't just hear my gun. Did you?
[4620.99s -> 4622.99s]  Okay
[4626.17s -> 4629.15s]  Uh, look at how many people are up here. This is ridiculous
[4631.66s -> 4632.94s]  Find him
[4632.94s -> 4635.82s]  Well, you did you found me?
[4638.49s -> 4640.73s]  A lot of blood a lot of blood here
[4641.61s -> 4652.27s]  A lot of blood missed lore missed lore
[4652.91s -> 4673.69s]  What I got five? I don't know what's over here. Is that this the way that I have to go?
[4674.49s -> 4678.94s]  I guess
[4678.94s -> 4680.94s]  Tell us the lore to mist
[4681.79s -> 4682.59s]  I
[4682.59s -> 4683.87s]  Couldn't do that
[4683.87s -> 4690.40s]  I couldn't do that
[4690.40s -> 4694.00s]  I don't know mist as you wake up on an island and you have to figure out why you woke up on the island and then
[4694.32s -> 4696.68s]  I guess leave the island
[4696.68s -> 4698.68s]  Is that somewhat accurate?
[4698.68s -> 4699.72s]  at least
[4699.72s -> 4708.75s]  slightly accurate
[4712.88s -> 4715.90s]  I couldn't stop
[4715.90s -> 4735.98s]  That may have just ended the stream. I sneezed the shit my pants. Kidding
[4737.13s -> 4742.81s]  Where is he? Oh health. I want that
[4751.84s -> 4753.52s]  nice health
[4753.52s -> 4756.03s]  upgrade
[4756.03s -> 4761.42s]  lore
[4761.42s -> 4763.42s]  He's no, i'm not
[4794.20s -> 4799.52s]  Sure, don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore
[4801.20s -> 4805.52s]  Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore
[4806.56s -> 4829.95s]  Instead of their doom a war is coming. I've seen it in my dreams
[4830.51s -> 4835.55s]  Fire sweeping over the earth bodies in the streets cities turn to dust
[4836.97s -> 4838.97s]  retaliation
[4839.55s -> 4844.03s]  This guy's doing a really great job of doing the random voice lines that play
[4844.75s -> 4849.79s]  When you spawn for the first time in a league of legends game as a champion
[4851.07s -> 4873.48s]  It's kind of all he does
[4873.48s -> 4876.04s]  fucked up medical stuff fucked up medical stuff
[4882.36s -> 4886.36s]  Who you know, the game starts to get hairy when there's a bunch of fucked up medical stuff
[4887.48s -> 4890.04s]  Like what are they? What are they doing in here?
[4890.44s -> 4924.43s]  All right, I got the upgrade. Wait, is this something else? I just ruined this gear
[4955.20s -> 4976.19s]  Stop stop it. What is that?
[4994.70s -> 4998.03s]  Wait, what?
[5002.06s -> 5005.18s]  I have to slow down
[5006.06s -> 5008.49s]  He did like a push-up
[5016.24s -> 5032.53s]  What how would you know it's me what if I was one of your colleagues what i'm trying to hide
[5074.14s -> 5077.26s]  That was not even slowed down but it sounded like it was
[5078.76s -> 5081.00s]  They all of them have been so far the whole game. They've been
[5083.40s -> 5087.64s]  That one was not slowed down. It was not during a slow down period. It was just
[5088.42s -> 5095.85s]  shit
[5095.85s -> 5099.05s]  God damn it. This is I love this game. What a fun game
[5119.36s -> 5121.52s]  Looks like we missed the party
[5123.02s -> 5125.58s]  If anything has taught me anything in my whole life
[5126.30s -> 5129.02s]  Ever since the talkback came out from home alone
[5129.58s -> 5134.14s]  If you slow anybody's voice down by 30 or 40 percent, it's funny every time
[5139.71s -> 5142.11s]  The talk boy the talk back. Yeah, the talk boy
[5151.10s -> 5153.42s]  Everybody had everybody had a talk boy
[5156.70s -> 5159.26s]  What what do you mean heads?
[5162.75s -> 5165.79s]  He dropped it on the how did you
[5166.83s -> 5168.83s]  How did you do that?
[5168.91s -> 5173.64s]  That's impossible

[5283.93s -> 5288.17s]  Instead of like like sliding backwards turn and sprint

[6083.15s -> 6085.55s]  There's probably one secret health pack that I didn't get
[6086.27s -> 6088.51s]  And I need it bad

[6666.57s -> 6671.85s]  No, he's just watching your life. Oh, this is not good. Oh shit
[6674.12s -> 6679.56s]  That's my line
[6679.64s -> 6683.36s]  Okay, don't use this that's for emergencies only
[6699.13s -> 6705.05s]  Uh, okay. I thought this was like a google satellite image of like a warehouse and roads and stuff. I was like, where is that?

[6732.70s -> 6745.60s]  I get more
[6745.60s -> 6747.60s]  Wait, kill the lights
[6751.32s -> 6754.11s]  Why would you kill the lights?
[6754.11s -> 6757.15s]  How can you see me in the dark? Do you have night vision?
[6761.24s -> 6764.57s]  No, he can't see me
[6764.57s -> 6772.56s]  I just like proved that he

[6803.20s -> 6806.24s]  Skill so I don't keep losing
[6807.04s -> 6809.12s]  I'll turn the lights back on for god's sake
[6812.67s -> 6820.68s]  They were sitting in the dark now, that's embarrassing they were huddled together terrified god
[6829.36s -> 6832.08s]  Nothing else
[6832.08s -> 6839.52s]  No, we should turn it off again. Is that the guy standing?
[6842.56s -> 6859.76s]  He uh, you think I have attention problems
[6884.51s -> 6889.32s]  I have to stop laughing at this. I have to like
[6905.53s -> 6907.53s]  You throw a grenade in a dark room
[6907.69s -> 6908.89s]  Oh
[6908.89s -> 6985.40s]  Pretty awful. Okay health. It's strange. There's a piece of shit. That's all the health that's here. Let's go
[6989.40s -> 6991.18s]  75 hp
[6991.18s -> 6994.54s]  Is not enough hp, especially when you're playing on hard mode
[6995.18s -> 7000.86s]  It's dangerous. That's where I just was
[7002.11s -> 7004.52s]  Hey, look at this
[7004.52s -> 7007.71s]  ooh
[7007.71s -> 7018.81s]  Nothing here. Well
[7018.89s -> 7026.01s]  Um, there's nothing I can interact with in here. That seems a little strange. It's like the only place I can go
[7029.47s -> 7036.46s]  Out the window because I was just down there wasn't I or was I not down there?
[7038.68s -> 7048.94s]  Maybe I wasn't down here. I guess I wasn't down here
[7057.69s -> 7060.87s]  interval seven
[7060.87s -> 7078.96s]  Redirection nothing. Okay, cool locate alice's office. I believe it's probably here somewhere. Look at a computer
[7079.12s -> 7092.17s]  There it is. I'm not skipping it
[7092.17s -> 7096.51s]  Except for me because i'm the third or i'm the first. No first is the girl
[7097.23s -> 7099.23s]  Second is fetal third is me
[7099.39s -> 7101.36s]  I mean
[7101.36s -> 7103.36s]  Come on, do I do I need to spell it out for you?
[7103.68s -> 7119.53s]  Okay
[7119.53s -> 7121.53s]  No health packs. That's not good
[7122.78s -> 7129.80s]  Why?
[7129.80s -> 7131.08s]  scary
[7131.08s -> 7141.64s]  scary thing
[7141.64s -> 7145.98s]  There we go handsome minds good
[7157.71s -> 7163.04s]  Uh, oh, okay. That was kind of creepy
[7171.16s -> 7184.92s]  Oops, looks like we're getting in
[7189.37s -> 7213.50s]  Is human garfield dead? I don't think I don't think so. It's possible. I would assume we'll see
[7214.14s -> 7246.08s]  That character again. All right, here's some lore. This sounds real important
[7251.31s -> 7253.76s]  received on
[7253.76s -> 7254.72s]  june
[7254.72s -> 7256.71s]  3rd
[7256.71s -> 7270.62s]  1991 no, I think if you if you work in a in like a corporate environment, you have to listen to your voicemails every morning
[7270.62s -> 7271.66s]  Don't you?
[7271.66s -> 7274.24s]  That's how it works
[7274.24s -> 7288.64s]  I want to get that. What is it? Where's this ringing phone?
[7289.20s -> 7293.24s]  Was it not even in this room?
[7293.24s -> 7320.67s]  I would have loved to have seen whatever scary thing was in here, but the venetian blinds prevented me from going in
[7323.42s -> 7325.42s]  Are you serious? Really?
[7330.09s -> 7339.93s]  I could just go into the door. Where's this phone?
[7341.05s -> 7343.13s]  This is fucking driving me crazy
[7343.93s -> 7409.90s]  Proteus i'm gonna find the other guy's office. It's not it break room. I mean we'll get in apparently, right?
[7409.98s -> 7423.74s]  No, not yet. We could do that later. I need to get health. Where's this fucking phone?
[7426.20s -> 7448.22s]  Oh, well, maybe in another lifetime. I'll get it. Oh it fell crap
[7449.18s -> 7460.89s]  Wow, it fell this way
[7461.85s -> 7471.66s]  Uh
[7471.66s -> 7489.98s]  Efficiency is not more important than safety. How much further do I have to go?
[7491.34s -> 7510.09s]  Hey, okay. There's a supernatural force blocking the door. Nice supply room health
[7511.72s -> 7524.01s]  Give me something else something more than that. No, no, no, there's nowhere else. I can go up here
[7525.58s -> 7531.20s]  Fine, I could go up. Let me just see what happens if I go up
[7537.53s -> 7543.98s]  Good thing I went up
[7543.98s -> 7550.43s]  Surprised there's no uh upgrade up here. That definitely is
[7552.32s -> 7555.95s]  somewhere, right
[7555.95s -> 7571.69s]  Nope climb it climb it down
[7578.51s -> 7582.12s]  All right, let's find what was this guy's name to find the other this other guy's office
[7584.81s -> 7592.49s]  All right. Well, we're at a checkpoint good and then pick up the phone in his office
[7603.05s -> 7605.05s]  Wait, these soldiers are eating people
[7607.40s -> 7611.47s]  I don't think that's what's going on
[7611.47s -> 7613.79s]  Why would somebody those guys are not eating people are they?
[7614.43s -> 7621.87s]  Was that ever implied?
[7621.87s -> 7625.90s]  I'm not sure that's the case
[7626.70s -> 7628.70s]  Oh, what the fucking hell
[7629.50s -> 7654.41s]  I'm not going over there
[7654.41s -> 7656.73s]  Doesn't read the lore starts asking what's happening
[7657.29s -> 7662.16s]  What I mean, I I know what's happening
[7667.16s -> 7685.90s]  We've listened to all the lore. I missed one lore. We listened to you
[7686.70s -> 7709.05s]  Not really. It was that one time when the guy was talking about um
[7711.05s -> 7713.29s]  Uh, like why are you not?
[7713.98s -> 7715.98s]  Talking to me. I'm trying to call you
[7716.70s -> 7732.36s]  What anybody left? I think that's it

[8054.48s -> 8059.84s]  There we go
[8059.84s -> 8062.00s]  It doesn't really do anything for me. Just kind of wraps back around
[8065.05s -> 8068.49s]  Uh, uh, yeah, I know i've wanted to go in that other room though
[8069.90s -> 8073.64s]  I got the health pack

[8106.75s -> 8108.75s]  I don't I shouldn't go down
[8110.11s -> 8112.11s]  Was there a room that I didn't go in up here?
[8114.00s -> 8116.00s]  He's just walking over dead bodies
[8116.40s -> 8128.92s]  You should have read the lore
[8128.92s -> 8130.60s]  Was I in the red area?
[8130.60s -> 8132.84s]  I just didn't go in the right spot
[8132.92s -> 8135.66s]  Well, we'll try it again
[8135.66s -> 8137.66s]  So this is where I was before
[8138.57s -> 8142.73s]  So this is like the middle room that goes through here's like a little break room
[8147.34s -> 8149.90s]  I guess I mean have I gone through here?
[8152.46s -> 8154.46s]  Yeah, because this is a circle
[8154.54s -> 8162.48s]  Yeah, this this whole this whole corner is just a circle
[8164.48s -> 8170.43s]  Is there a door here?
[8170.43s -> 8173.88s]  Or do I have to go down?
[8173.88s -> 8175.88s]  Because this is actually just a circle
[8176.12s -> 8180.03s]  Oh, here we go. There's still a spot here
[8180.43s -> 8184.32s]  I feel like I need to get in there
[8184.32s -> 8197.31s]  All right
[8197.31s -> 8199.31s]  Where is your phone?
[8199.55s -> 8222.00s]  Okay. Am I in your office?
[8223.50s -> 8234.20s]  I don't think I am
[8234.20s -> 8255.96s]  What why did you do that? Jesus?
[8275.26s -> 8278.73s]  What's your status?
[8278.73s -> 8283.85s]  Uh, well, I don't know somebody made a mistake is the status whatever that is

[8305.45s -> 8307.53s]  Oh that goes into that other room. Okay. I know what that is
[8308.01s -> 8318.24s]  Okay, I want to explore a little
[8318.96s -> 8321.44s]  A little bit see if I can get some more stuff
[8323.32s -> 8324.28s]  Like this
[8324.28s -> 8329.47s]  Okay, I got the full one. I'm gonna actually use that for a little while
[8329.95s -> 8335.13s]  What about this?
[8335.13s -> 8336.49s]  Ooh
[8336.49s -> 8381.80s]  It's turret time. I think I did it. How do I get out? So that takes care of that
[8383.55s -> 8398.17s]  Now I just to go back there and go in that room easy. Yeah. Well, just get a checkpoint anyways
[8398.57s -> 8404.84s]  Okay, this is back this way
[8405.56s -> 8407.80s]  There's one of the first doors back here
[8409.60s -> 8410.72s]  All right
[8410.72s -> 8418.97s]  What is this?
[8418.97s -> 8422.81s]  There it is and everybody's gone
[8423.79s -> 8426.43s]  I get the place to myself for the first time ever
[8437.29s -> 8452.03s]  That's hurry up music. I guess we're just gonna go
[8462.38s -> 8465.42s]  Why does it want me to go so fast? What does it want from me?
[8480.59s -> 8483.85s]  um
[8483.85s -> 8485.93s]  Faster, but why did it start here?
[8487.04s -> 8490.68s]  Um move move move, but there's nowhere to go
[8492.57s -> 8494.57s]  It wants you to slide kick the bodies
[8500.27s -> 8502.35s]  Oh, come on. Who heard that?
[8502.83s -> 8515.61s]  Is somebody up here? This has to be opened. Yeah, I think I can't do shit up here
[8515.61s -> 8535.02s]  I gotta go the other way. Holy fuck
[8536.04s -> 8540.08s]  You lived
[8553.23s -> 8584.99s]  Wait, I thought he was a chair. Okay. Uh, nothing nothing nothing
[8586.03s -> 8593.45s]  I don't hate anxiety music in games. It makes me feel like I I have to rush
[8619.47s -> 8629.42s]  Good not bad. Let's go now. We got new music
[8629.82s -> 8635.84s]  Why is the soundtrack just kicking in for the first time ever right now?
[8655.32s -> 8657.77s]  What?
[8657.77s -> 8658.89s]  Why
[8658.89s -> 8660.89s]  Why did he say that?
[8664.28s -> 8667.79s]  Oh shit
[8668.75s -> 8677.53s]  Wait, why is he why why did he move all this stuff?
[8678.65s -> 8683.13s]  The squad check it. That's some there's some problems in that troop
[8686.88s -> 8688.88s]  Shut your fucking mouth
[8702.30s -> 8704.44s]  Wait
[8704.44s -> 8708.62s]  Where are they?
[8708.62s -> 8712.38s]  What the fuck are they using for a weapon? It's inside my head
[8712.78s -> 8716.46s]  I it's inside my brain when they fire it. It's firing in my head
[8764.09s -> 8765.85s]  I'm trying
[8765.85s -> 8767.85s]  What was that noise?
[8768.57s -> 8774.94s]  That was the
[8774.94s -> 8777.10s]  That was an arcade, you know when you walk by the arcade
[8778.17s -> 8783.37s]  Do you want to know that sound that's the most the most quintessential arcade sound effect?
[8783.93s -> 8785.53s]  I'm gonna see if I can do it
[8785.53s -> 8790.81s]  You'll know exactly what I mean when I do this when you're walking by an arcade or there's an arcade near you or you're in an
[8790.81s -> 8792.81s]  Arcade and you hear this sound
[8804.57s -> 8807.37s]  That's the only sound that's the number one thing you pull from an arcade
[8811.48s -> 8813.48s]  And I don't even know what machine that is
[8813.96s -> 8821.92s]  I it's at every I don't know what it is. You just never know what that sound is
[8821.92s -> 8823.92s]  But you know what it's there every time
[8828.11s -> 8830.91s]  It's funny because i've never played a game of the arcade that made that sound
[8832.49s -> 8835.13s]  But i've heard it every time
[8835.13s -> 8836.97s]  Why?
[8836.97s -> 8838.97s]  Where should I go?
[8838.97s -> 8842.41s]  I wish I we just gotta I wish we just gotta shut the fuck up right there
[8849.92s -> 8851.68s]  There's nobody here
[8851.68s -> 8854.24s]  This this blood did he hit his head?
[8855.04s -> 8857.04s]  Oh, he's over here now
[8862.92s -> 8866.00s]  Oh shit
[8866.00s -> 8867.98s]  He's
[8867.98s -> 8875.02s]  No, that's I want to do better than that the blind boomer
[8879.74s -> 8885.69s]  Why was there blood here?
[8885.85s -> 8887.85s]  You understand there's blood
[8888.17s -> 8891.50s]  I want whatever the gun they have I want it
[8891.82s -> 8894.51s]  What the fuck is this? It's a shotgun
[8894.59s -> 8896.83s]  That's not that doesn't make any sense. That's impossible
[8897.79s -> 8908.22s]  What do you have for a gun?
[8908.22s -> 8910.22s]  So they were shooting from back here
[8910.96s -> 8912.40s]  like this
[8912.40s -> 8915.36s]  With a shotgun and it was like I was being sniped in the head
[8917.53s -> 8920.83s]  Cactus. Yep
[8920.83s -> 8922.27s]  Good call. Thanks

[8979.92s -> 8981.92s]  Somebody come on
[8982.16s -> 8984.16s]  You gotta go through this
[8984.24s -> 8986.64s]  through the hole
[8986.64s -> 8992.24s]  without slo-mo
[8992.24s -> 8994.24s]  Just bang through the hole

[8999.79s -> 9044.75s]  Why are they getting so defensive now? They weren't they weren't doing this before
[9055.58s -> 9056.86s]  He's
[9056.86s -> 9058.54s]  It's not gonna help you
[9058.54s -> 9060.54s]  It's it's a couch
[9065.71s -> 9067.71s]  Somebody back here does not want to take orders
[9094.88s -> 9096.88s]  These guys are fucked
[9099.21s -> 9121.98s]  They hate each other now. What happened? They hate each other. How do you win three?

[10223.02s -> 10225.02s]  I
[10225.98s -> 10228.94s]  I'm laughing. I'm not laughing at the explosion. I'm laughing at the
[10229.98s -> 10231.02s]  shit
[10231.02s -> 10233.34s]  Just okay. I need to I want to look this time
[10243.90s -> 10245.90s]  Well
[10247.58s -> 10249.58s]  What I thought it just exploded
[10280.94s -> 10291.02s]  No, right
[10291.02s -> 10302.09s]  All right. Hold on that guy's so bloody
[10302.73s -> 10334.01s]  Where's the other guy?
[10338.97s -> 10357.30s]  What an idiot what a moron, all right, let's go i'm supposed to cut her off
[10369.58s -> 10373.73s]  Whatever flashlight
[10386.75s -> 10389.39s]  How did we have the same idea every time
[10390.35s -> 10409.42s]  He fucking made it
[10410.14s -> 10411.50s]  Whoa
[10411.50s -> 10468.52s]  Pretty good. I have to cut her off. So I have to go down there. I think but there could be a health pack
[10469.48s -> 10471.48s]  And that's much more important to me
[10474.12s -> 10484.92s]  than game progress
[10484.92s -> 10486.68s]  Absolutely ridiculous
[10486.68s -> 10494.11s]  Which elevator this one? No. Oh, come on. I can't get in there
[10494.75s -> 10500.38s]  Let's just have to go down
[10520.91s -> 10523.87s]  This guy's voice change he's not he doesn't have the accent
[10527.48s -> 10530.36s]  He used to talk like this and he's like that's it not anymore
[10531.16s -> 10544.24s]  He just happens to have an accent
[10544.24s -> 10548.46s]  You you could have said something
[10548.46s -> 10551.34s]  Oh look another character that is unarmed
[10552.36s -> 10554.54s]  unarmored and surrounded by lanister swords
[10558.43s -> 10566.03s]  Come with me
[10566.03s -> 10569.71s]  I don't care as long as one person as long as one person gets that. I don't care
[10580.12s -> 10591.92s]  Like two people will know what that is. I don't that's good for me. I don't care. It wasn't
[10610.60s -> 10618.17s]  Well, I thought you guys I thought better of you guys you didn't get it you didn't get it
[10621.13s -> 10632.44s]  Just didn't get it
[10632.44s -> 10658.25s]  Don't you know there are two ways to make everybody angry in chat make a rick and morty reference or say the word game of thrones
[10658.81s -> 10661.53s]  I think it's a guaranteed way to make everybody angry
[10662.33s -> 10672.25s]  Do a do a game of thrones reference and everybody will start screaming
[10673.42s -> 10675.60s]  It's like the new rick and morty
[10675.60s -> 10679.20s]  Remember like season one rick and morty everybody loved it and thought it was like a funny show
[10680.62s -> 10685.18s]  And then they the show kept going and everyone was like, I hate that show game of thrones season one and two
[10685.26s -> 10688.06s]  Oh everybody, that's the best show on tv now. Everybody hates that show
[10692.38s -> 10695.58s]  It's weird. Yeah, that's it's very simple very simple process
[10703.45s -> 10728.81s]  Fucking master manipulator. Sorry. All right. I'm going over here master manipulator, but
[10729.61s -> 10732.09s]  Can't fucking follow simple directions
[10733.88s -> 10749.50s]  You know, we have our weaknesses
[10750.54s -> 10752.86s]  master manipulator as a
[10752.86s -> 10754.14s]  Fairly
[10754.14s -> 10757.74s]  Sore sense of direction as you see very clearly
[10760.14s -> 10763.98s]  Oh, but once I get out of here, I will put you in a scenario that
[10765.24s -> 10772.33s]  You'll be very upset that you got it and make you angry and maybe eventually if I could figure it out
[10772.33s -> 10775.37s]  I don't know how I even got in here in the first place. I don't fucking remember
[10778.20s -> 10780.20s]  I actually don't remember how I got in here
[10788.08s -> 10799.80s]  Found it. What's another one? What's another show or movie or something that everyone like really liked
[10801.39s -> 10806.73s]  And then everybody hates now. I'm trying to think
[10810.92s -> 10812.59s]  Dexter
[10812.59s -> 10814.81s]  Yeah, maybe
[10814.81s -> 10818.73s]  I guess the real moral of that story is if you don't want the word
[10819.05s -> 10823.85s]  Or if reference to your show to make everybody like puke in their mouths and hate everything about your show
[10824.49s -> 10827.69s]  Is to just only have five seasons ever of a television show
[10829.16s -> 10830.76s]  I think that's what it is
[10830.76s -> 10837.63s]  Think of every tv show that had that had like less than five seasons people remember it very fondly
[10838.19s -> 10852.49s]  Okay, let's go
[10852.49s -> 10854.92s]  Five is too many
[10863.31s -> 10865.71s]  House had eight seasons house did
[10866.35s -> 10870.52s]  Get a little weird at the last like two or three seasons though. You know what I mean?
[10871.98s -> 10875.18s]  I if house was five four or five seasons, I think it would have been fine
[10875.82s -> 10888.36s]  But then you were you run into a family guy scenario where family guy had like three or four seasons and everybody loves that
[10888.44s -> 10893.40s]  Fucking those seasons best. Wow. That's the most that's the most funny the most hysterical show on television
[10894.65s -> 10899.29s]  Oh my god, I wish they would bring it back bring back family guy. It was so good everybody
[10899.37s -> 10904.49s]  Oh, it's my favorite fucking tv show. Please bring it back fox, please god
[10904.57s -> 10907.05s]  It's on adult swim now. Everybody loves this fucking show
[10908.16s -> 10916.80s]  And then they do 10 more seasons and now here we are everybody that everyone hates that show. It's it's weird how that happens
[10920.33s -> 10923.13s]  Because they went too long. They did it too long. They went too long
[10930.72s -> 10933.60s]  Simpsons was only good bad. Yeah, but here's the thing
[10935.28s -> 10937.28s]  Like south park is still good
[10946.20s -> 10948.94s]  What about that inch?
[10948.94s -> 10950.94s]  Now we're fighting robots. Okay
[10956.04s -> 10963.77s]  No, it isn't what?
[10963.77s -> 10967.85s]  I think south park is still doing like still making fun funny shit
[10973.87s -> 10978.35s]  Chat thinks nothing is good. Is that that's another thing too. Do you guys like anything?
[10981.29s -> 10984.25s]  Does anybody does anybody on twitch like anything?
[10988.73s -> 10991.85s]  I mean, I have a lot of things that I don't like but I feel like
[10992.49s -> 10994.65s]  Does anybody enjoy anything anymore?
[10999.58s -> 11006.84s]  Hold show that I already have that what's your favorite? What's your favorite tv show?
[11009.61s -> 11026.94s]  And don't say dream of that night five because we already know that one. Should I go in here? He took my answer
[11027.02s -> 11029.18s]  Wait, let me let me let me pay attention for one second
[11029.90s -> 11033.36s]  I want to make sure I don't miss any like heels or something
[11037.28s -> 11039.23s]  mash
[11039.23s -> 11047.55s]  All right. Yeah, it's
[11047.55s -> 11049.55s]  It's probably actually your stream
[11050.36s -> 11052.20s]  Well, thanks
[11052.20s -> 11056.35s]  uh
[11056.35s -> 11059.55s]  You know, i'm of the opinion we've got we've got like too much media now
[11060.62s -> 11061.98s]  It's like it's
[11061.98s -> 11063.98s]  With you could just open up netflix
[11064.46s -> 11066.78s]  And watch every television show ever
[11070.96s -> 11072.96s]  You got like netflix hulu
[11073.77s -> 11076.41s]  hbo now
[11076.41s -> 11079.69s]  You've got so many shows and so many movies
[11082.16s -> 11086.08s]  It used to be you had to wait until that shit was on cable television
[11086.72s -> 11089.04s]  once a week
[11089.04s -> 11093.76s]  Now it's just every every two weeks. There's like five new netflix movies
[11094.73s -> 11096.73s]  Where the fuck do these come from?
[11103.04s -> 11108.44s]  And they're all bad
[11108.44s -> 11110.60s]  This is a 75 year old opinion
[11111.96s -> 11116.36s]  I don't think so. I it's just like there's this a lot. Hold on aliens
[11117.32s -> 11133.66s]  Can I turn those into a skeleton? That'd be cool
[11136.04s -> 11138.04s]  Everything's in color nowadays
[11140.76s -> 11148.22s]  No, there's a lot of options
[11148.22s -> 11150.22s]  Oh, yeah, do you see me?
[11153.76s -> 11160.92s]  He's too fast
[11162.12s -> 11173.29s]  A minute it's making the arcade sound
[11175.55s -> 11179.39s]  Oh i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead in that scenario I gotta pull out the other gun
[11180.11s -> 11187.48s]  What was the last time I saved it?
[11187.48s -> 11189.24s]  Why am I all the way back here?
[11189.24s -> 11193.02s]  Are you serious?
[11193.02s -> 11204.73s]  Why are they aliens? No, it's not it's this way. I think they're just robot drone attack
[11205.90s -> 11207.50s]  things
[11207.50s -> 11213.13s]  I didn't save

[11230.75s -> 11232.25s]  You know what I mean?
[11232.25s -> 11236.68s]  It really does feel like if if everybody loves your show
[11239.66s -> 11243.26s]  More than five to eight years later. Everybody doesn't like your show
[11243.82s -> 11249.63s]  All right, here we go

[12218.30s -> 12232.36s]  turn the corner
[12232.36s -> 12245.84s]  g2
[12245.84s -> 12247.28s]  How do I
[12247.28s -> 12249.28s]  That's not gonna do anything man
[12251.10s -> 12253.50s]  Holy shit. Is that how you stop getting hurt from a grenade?
[12271.77s -> 12273.77s]  I do not have any
[12274.17s -> 12276.67s]  I'm gonna have to use the electric gun
[12277.31s -> 12295.21s]  See ya
[12295.21s -> 12304.81s]  That electric gun is pretty good
[12304.89s -> 12306.65s]  What did you have?
[12306.65s -> 12314.17s]  Don't want it
[12314.17s -> 12316.56s]  Dude, don't
[12316.56s -> 12318.56s]  Don't do that people
[12324.52s -> 12329.20s]  Good. I think i've made it to the top
[12331.64s -> 12339.32s]  Right. Damn it. No secret
[12339.90s -> 12340.62s]  I have to look at that
[12340.62s -> 12345.02s]  Well, hold on. I can't alt tab when I alt tab the game will crash if I don't do it in a very specific way
[12345.18s -> 12347.18s]  this way
[12353.93s -> 12359.77s]  Oh, I did it I did it
[12371.69s -> 12373.69s]  Why there
[12374.43s -> 12376.43s]  No car bus
[12382.54s -> 12405.40s]  I really thought we were that was we were gonna get out of there
[12408.41s -> 12409.53s]  You know what I mean?
[12409.53s -> 12412.73s]  It looks okay, but the pilot's dead and jen's banged up pretty bad
[12414.44s -> 12418.76s]  I'll live we're fine. It'll be a while before I can ice skate again. Yeah, we're fine. We have dialogue
[12419.32s -> 12425.00s]  You sure you want to send him alone? These guys ain't fucking around
[12429.66s -> 12435.36s]  By the time backup reaches you we're still a couple of clicks away from the ramama compound
[12435.52s -> 12437.52s]  So you're gonna have to get there on foot
[12437.68s -> 12452.40s]  Hope it's true. Oh, it's true
[12452.40s -> 12463.12s]  It's true
[12463.12s -> 12465.12s]  She'll be okay. It's you i'm worried about
[12472.70s -> 12474.70s]  Okay, let's go
[12475.29s -> 12476.73s]  Can't go in there
[12476.73s -> 12496.56s]  Can't go in here kind of a creepy place though. I thought that was a person folded in half
[12497.96s -> 12502.52s]  I looked over. I thought that was their legs in the shoes and that was their body like folded up
[12503.56s -> 12515.52s]  Okay, i'm getting condemned vibes from this place
[12516.96s -> 12518.96s]  That game is great
[12518.96s -> 12521.20s]  What a great game that was
[12521.44s -> 12535.71s]  You didn't finish the second one. I didn't I never finished the second one. Are you sure?
[12539.00s -> 12541.00s]  Uh, yeah, I did
[12542.04s -> 12553.77s]  Yeah, I did
[12553.77s -> 12555.77s]  I think he threw
[12555.85s -> 12585.26s]  Okay, I think the guy just stepped on his friend. All right, let's get the shotgun going
[12588.83s -> 12590.83s]  Stuff in this room probably
[12601.32s -> 12603.87s]  Both of them
[12603.87s -> 12605.55s]  Oh, I got them both
[12605.55s -> 12619.93s]  Is he dead? I think so
[12620.09s -> 12632.16s]  What am I looking for in here the enemy patrols?
[12633.04s -> 12637.95s]  I'm just walking
[12637.95s -> 12654.63s]  What is going on?
[12654.63s -> 12655.61s]  uninhabitable
[12655.61s -> 12664.62s]  Hello, is this guy dead?
[12665.02s -> 12701.58s]  No, okay itchy face itchy face. Not good lethal shoulder injury go through here this way
[12703.51s -> 12711.05s]  Uninhabitable, I can't get in. Come on. Really? So how do I get through here? I gotta go all the way around
[12715.00s -> 12717.00s]  Can I make it through here?
[12717.08s -> 12719.21s]  I mean I can
[12719.21s -> 12720.49s]  Not really
[12720.49s -> 12730.14s]  Should maybe go down the hole
[12730.14s -> 12732.94s]  Because I can go
[12732.94s -> 12734.94s]  What is that fucking explosion?
[12738.96s -> 12740.96s]  Oh, I do have to go down there. Okay
[12741.53s -> 12752.32s]  All right, I see the health pack
[12752.32s -> 12774.44s]  You idiot that might soft lock me. Oh my god. What are these guys? Seriously you motherfuckers?
[12788.75s -> 12790.81s]  great, all right
[12790.81s -> 12804.30s]  I could be
[12804.30s -> 12836.30s]  Guy was right here. Don't throw a grenade, please. He was good. He was gonna say it
[12836.78s -> 12841.02s]  He was gonna say it. I stopped him from saying it. He was supposed to say
[12842.75s -> 12861.00s]  Uh-oh
[12861.00s -> 12873.79s]  Whatever it is. It's big
[12873.79s -> 12884.83s]  Oh dear
[12884.83s -> 12890.57s]  You all right. Oh my god, he can run through we can break through all the walls
[12892.52s -> 12937.63s]  Holy shit. I i'm gonna use this whole damn thing
[12944.09s -> 12946.97s]  Holy god. Oh
[12947.13s -> 12955.92s]  I only have five more shots out of this thing. It's like the most powerful gun in the game and that took so long
[12957.31s -> 12962.41s]  Holy shit. Okay
[12962.41s -> 12969.87s]  Well, maybe I can get out of here now. What did he destroy?
[12970.89s -> 12976.38s]  Wait a minute
[12976.38s -> 12978.62s]  Where is this? Okay. Now this is the right way
[12979.26s -> 12990.01s]  Watch there be two of those things. There's gonna be two of those things
[13026.56s -> 13040.83s]  What happened it's that motherfucker right there
[13041.63s -> 13054.62s]  I
[13054.62s -> 13056.62s]  Don't know what they were looking at there, but
[13057.58s -> 13058.94s]  It wasn't me
[13058.94s -> 13080.64s]  Where is he right there? Is that is that him? Is that the guy who the fuck it is?
[13097.00s -> 13107.04s]  Well, they all have one
[13107.04s -> 13110.08s]  I want I wish I'd be going that room and get all that ammo. That'd be great. All right
[13110.08s -> 13116.38s]  We have to make a jump here. Is that not where you go?
[13125.80s -> 13132.35s]  Um, is there a little thing maybe thing on the right because of that I think that's what I have to do
[13135.02s -> 13144.91s]  Just yeah, it's right there in the nova you got to stand on like the brick part sticking out
[13157.82s -> 13160.14s]  Oh fuck, whoa, he went the other way
[13162.36s -> 13165.72s]  God damn it. That sucks. Do I really have to restart this again?
[13166.36s -> 13176.56s]  I don't think I can't cross over here. So is it really just that simple?
[13178.06s -> 13180.06s]  No, it's not is it? I don't think I can do this
[13182.65s -> 13184.65s]  That looks like you stand there and jump to there
[13187.32s -> 13189.64s]  Is that don't admit that's maybe not what you're supposed to do
[13193.63s -> 13200.16s]  I don't think you're supposed to do that
[13200.16s -> 13210.96s]  But I did it. I got a lot of ammo for this thing
[13220.72s -> 13223.52s]  Okay, um, I need to start using that
[13226.12s -> 13232.96s]  I'm just target practice
[13232.96s -> 13234.08s]  Let's go
[13234.08s -> 13238.92s]  Who else is here?
[13238.92s -> 13240.70s]  Anybody else?
[13240.70s -> 13242.70s]  Oh, wow. Look at you
[13242.70s -> 13246.38s]  That's what I get for talking shit. I don't why am I talking?
[13258.12s -> 13278.56s]  Helpax no
[13278.56s -> 13279.60s]  All right, here we go
[13279.60s -> 13314.14s]  Where's the southern guy? There's three of them and then there's another guy over here somewhere up on the roof. I think okay
[13314.78s -> 13326.25s]  Anybody else? Oh
[13326.25s -> 13352.04s]  Okay, that was a bad place to save the game, but it's okay save it right here. Nobody else, right?
[13353.23s -> 13355.39s]  Don't just pop out of the window and shoot me in the head, please
[13361.53s -> 13372.88s]  Yeah, what's one person? Oh, no, how scary? Why is this so scary?
[13378.49s -> 13384.56s]  That was they had they played specific music to be
[13385.72s -> 13400.33s]  Scared of that guy. He's what he's playing this on easy. This is on hard
[13403.13s -> 13425.20s]  What's with all the meat? I can't see shit in here. He flew up so fast
[13425.92s -> 13454.70s]  That the top of the door guillotined his head. That was fucked up. These are oh, give me that
[13455.02s -> 13457.42s]  These are the guys with the lightning the electric guns
[13459.93s -> 13462.41s]  That's pretty great. How much do I have now?
[13463.03s -> 13464.49s]  28
[13464.49s -> 13466.09s]  Nice, that's awesome
[13466.09s -> 13481.05s]  Where is he the fuck is he? Where is he?
[13486.64s -> 13488.64s]  I heard check it out. So where is he?
[13498.41s -> 13517.80s]  I'm gonna run right into him accidentally over here. He's over there. What what is he talking?
[13521.29s -> 13523.29s]  I thought he was talking
[13524.25s -> 13527.69s]  I was trying to listen to him. I thought he was having that conversation with the guy
[13528.17s -> 13530.81s]  He was a blackhawk helicopter crashed
[13569.00s -> 13571.00s]  There's a health thing in there
[13571.08s -> 13573.08s]  Is he alive?
[13605.26s -> 13623.58s]  Found him. He was outside on the side. This place sucks. All right, give me the uh upgrade
[13626.98s -> 13658.09s]  170 health seems pretty good. Doesn't it? Okay, let's go get in there. All right
[13658.33s -> 13668.99s]  Oh this she is the girl that drive drove off in her car. I should liquidate you right now
[13669.07s -> 13713.95s]  Wait, somebody behind you no flashlight somebody in here
[13714.59s -> 13716.59s]  What what happened? What happened?
[13718.03s -> 13731.79s]  What?
[13737.76s -> 13745.80s]  Dead
[13745.80s -> 13757.13s]  No, that was just a pot and a piece of cardboard no, not this
[13766.84s -> 13802.83s]  I took damage in my dream. That's bullshit. That does not that's not how it works damn. Yeah, I took damage in my dream
[13803.07s -> 13813.44s]  That's not how that you can't get hurt in your dreams. Yes, you can
[13816.06s -> 13820.86s]  Yeah, maybe if you like are having a dream about something and you like punch yourself in the face in the dream, maybe
[13823.77s -> 13828.81s]  If you like roll around and like roll out of bed and hit your head on your night table next to you then yeah
[13835.69s -> 13838.65s]  If you like sleepwalk making eggs and you put your hand in the pan
[13840.22s -> 13850.06s]  Yeah
[13850.06s -> 13851.58s]  I don't want to go that way
[13851.58s -> 13868.03s]  Wait, there might be a health back in here. What the hell was that?
[13868.83s -> 13870.51s]  Give him back
[13870.51s -> 13877.79s]  That is the exact tv that I used to hide under my blanket and watch wwf wrestling when I was younger
[13878.35s -> 13880.11s]  the exact television
[13880.11s -> 13908.56s]  That's not the right gun. All right, let's move now
[13917.63s -> 13925.24s]  Why do they do that every time
[13925.40s -> 13928.52s]  It's almost like they the game knows when I press the grenade button
[13945.55s -> 13947.55s]  Not this time
[13953.31s -> 13955.31s]  That's fucking ridiculous
[13956.24s -> 13961.29s]  Oh
[13961.29s -> 13964.88s]  Okay, let me slow down
[13964.96s -> 13968.11s]  this in my brain
[13968.11s -> 13971.12s]  There was no
[13971.18s -> 13975.20s]  Possible fucking way that there was going to be another person inside of that truck
[13982.70s -> 13989.48s]  Impossible. Oh, no, I can't get in
[13998.16s -> 14005.85s]  Checkpoint good two health packs. What are you preparing me for?
[14006.81s -> 14009.56s]  What are you preparing me for?
[14027.15s -> 14033.02s]  It's important, let's I just want to see if it's possible to get hit by
[14035.66s -> 14051.92s]  Okay, so I needed to make sure I didn't want to see if it was possible did I just drop that
[14052.56s -> 14073.34s]  Does anybody know what happened?
[14074.94s -> 14076.94s]  I'm camping
[14077.66s -> 14080.86s]  Spawn camping of spawn camp
[14081.42s -> 14083.42s]  Uh
[14093.15s -> 14096.13s]  Who the fuck are you oh that's so funny
[14106.17s -> 14115.66s]  What the fuck hello idiot
[14119.04s -> 14121.04s]  Uh-oh, it's like a it's one of those
[14123.23s -> 14129.88s]  Okay
[14132.22s -> 14136.46s]  Spawn killing. Oh, it's gonna make me laugh every fucking time
[14151.05s -> 14168.00s]  Oh, okay, I would laugh if they just kept spawning
[14172.17s -> 14174.57s]  Like why wouldn't they be able to get out
[14180.20s -> 14184.52s]  To just hold just hold down left mouse button one of you will kill me
[14187.87s -> 14191.97s]  Even when there's a hacker. Oh, you can just hold left mouse button out the door
[14196.89s -> 14210.76s]  Uh
[14210.76s -> 14212.76s]  There's more in there now
[14219.74s -> 14229.66s]  Were there four in there last time?
[14251.16s -> 14257.90s]  Okay, that's that I want to be like in that perspective
[14258.99s -> 14261.79s]  I've been in that perspective before that perspective is just a guy
[14262.43s -> 14263.71s]  going
[14263.71s -> 14268.99s]  Speed hacking back and forth and just holding down the mouse button that auto aims to your head
[14269.79s -> 14271.79s]  And all of us just like oh, no
[14272.51s -> 14279.07s]  Hold on wait, wait, just pocket medic me uber me uber me. We'll get out. We'll get out just just everybody took five medics
[14279.87s -> 14285.10s]  I know what that's like
[14285.10s -> 14331.60s]  It was bullshit. All right, I got full armor. I don't want it something's about to happen here. So i'm gonna
[14332.24s -> 14336.46s]  I don't know. So i'm just gonna bust through
[14337.18s -> 14341.10s]  Yeah, look at all these health packs. They're giving me this is gonna be fight against something
[14342.46s -> 14343.90s]  through here
[14343.90s -> 14346.33s]  No, really?
[14346.33s -> 14349.44s]  i'm surprised
[14349.44s -> 14372.19s]  Oh, right. Okay, we're going over the fence. You can't jump it
[14373.34s -> 14377.55s]  There's a door right here
[14377.55s -> 14379.55s]  It's the revenge of the
[14390.09s -> 14392.12s]  Where is it going?
[14392.12s -> 14393.48s]  Where is it going?
[14393.48s -> 14405.63s]  backing up
[14405.63s -> 14409.10s]  You still alive
[14409.10s -> 14411.10s]  I think that guy fell in the window
[14413.96s -> 14415.96s]  Yeah, I think I didn't know what the fuck he was doing
[14416.44s -> 14447.58s]  Checked the back of that car. I was too focused on that guy
[14464.44s -> 14474.72s]  Anything else? No
[14474.72s -> 14478.08s]  Largest concentration. This is gonna be fun. Now, isn't it?
[14489.84s -> 14491.28s]  scaffoldings
[14491.28s -> 14515.74s]  Okay, nothing down here. It's not I don't get to be a badass like I was told
[14516.54s -> 14520.65s]  Save it here
[14520.65s -> 14524.49s]  Uh, I need to use the bathroom. I've got to use the bathroom. I gotta pee
[14525.74s -> 14528.22s]  So let me say let me get in a spot on the corner here
[14529.34s -> 14535.24s]  I'll be right back. I have to use the bathroom in game. No, like in real life
[14535.96s -> 14689.74s]  I'll be right back
[14689.74s -> 14694.48s]  All right
[14694.56s -> 14697.60s]  I have returned
[14705.21s -> 14713.88s]  Hello, so I feel like we're getting to the uh
[14715.69s -> 14719.85s]  The last leg of a game if I were to take a guess I would say this is probably it
[14724.04s -> 14726.04s]  Eliminate enemy patrols
[14726.46s -> 14739.24s]  This is another sniper section
[14739.24s -> 14742.41s]  Oh, no another fucking car
[14760.96s -> 14769.24s]  It was a whole squad in there. They were ready. They're sitting in the back. Let's go. We're gonna do it
[14769.56s -> 14771.56s]  We're gonna kill this motherfucker
[14773.66s -> 14775.58s]  I don't know what the driver
[14775.58s -> 14777.47s]  Is doing
[14777.47s -> 14778.43s]  Why?
[14778.43s -> 14785.42s]  Would you do that?
[14785.42s -> 14787.42s]  It's like hey, uh
[14787.42s -> 14789.90s]  That tom tom he's right there
[14790.91s -> 14794.99s]  Tom you're still going tom. You're going over the cliff
[14820.46s -> 14830.09s]  Okay, he knows we're fighting. You know what? I've noticed a lot more in this part of the game here
[14830.97s -> 14832.97s]  Not a whole lot of enemy talking
[14834.41s -> 14835.85s]  I think they're
[14835.85s -> 14839.72s]  I think they're trying to focus
[14839.72s -> 14843.93s]  Well, two can play at that game. I just won't talk either
[14855.98s -> 14867.53s]  Uh, never mind they're talking
[14867.53s -> 14869.19s]  That is
[14869.19s -> 14872.25s]  Unbelievable that he still was able to get that off
[14872.57s -> 14874.73s]  He got 10
[14874.73s -> 14882.65s]  Seven or eight bullets in his arm and his body and he still pulled it off his angle even changed
[14883.05s -> 14933.98s]  What happened? Oh, there was a tank right there. Nice. He's still left by the legs
[14934.62s -> 14939.90s]  All right. I gotta get up. Hold on check check check check check check
[14940.62s -> 14942.60s]  Check we're good
[14942.60s -> 14943.56s]  check
[14943.64s -> 14947.48s]  Get up one health back
[14960.51s -> 14962.51s]  Did he just dodge it
[14963.16s -> 14968.22s]  He went like this
[14968.22s -> 14976.86s]  Holy shit, man
[14976.86s -> 14980.30s]  I can't what I go from here. I gotta jump from here to there
[14981.96s -> 14984.76s]  Okay, I have to jump. No, I don't it's right here
[14992.57s -> 14994.57s]  The health upgrade. Yeah, I know i'll get it
[14994.73s -> 14999.21s]  I think I have to go around for the health upgrade like this
[14999.93s -> 15003.44s]  Can I see?
[15003.44s -> 15005.44s]  Well, it's not a health upgrade but
[15005.96s -> 15011.29s]  still good
[15011.37s -> 15023.90s]  Uh, I do want to go up here and see if there's anything over here though. We'll check there is
[15026.80s -> 15029.92s]  Body armor is nice, but I don't really this doesn't open right now
[15035.90s -> 15039.74s]  Nothing no fall damage, right?
[15044.67s -> 15057.36s]  Let's go
[15057.36s -> 15059.36s]  Down or around probably around first
[15059.44s -> 15067.87s]  Spawn camp are they just sitting in there waiting for me to do something?
[15074.96s -> 15076.96s]  All right. I'm gonna surround
[15076.96s -> 15079.52s]  I'm gonna surround the uh outside with stickies
[15080.16s -> 15082.16s]  And the second I see the door open to right click
[15083.98s -> 15087.98s]  And then watch the chat room and watch everybody in that spawn
[15088.70s -> 15090.70s]  Talk about how much of a piece of shit I am
[15091.42s -> 15098.01s]  That's gonna open right?
[15098.01s -> 15103.37s]  All right. I'm taking a gamble that this is going to open. That's just a gamble. I'm just i'm playing the odds
[15104.09s -> 15114.60s]  Okay, i'm just playing odds. I can pick them up if it doesn't happen. There's also a health upgrade over there. I think
[15115.32s -> 15130.25s]  Okay, so you can open
[15130.25s -> 15135.45s]  It might it actually might they might have to turn something on and all of a sudden boom it opens
[15140.80s -> 15147.88s]  Doesn't look like it that happens though. Just
[15150.30s -> 15160.72s]  Know that I was thinking about it. Let's make this smart
[15188.51s -> 15214.49s]  Wait, wait, don't do it yet. He's almost here. You're not gonna. Why do you guys always do this? Oh
[15219.69s -> 15246.56s]  You all right. You're actually pretty smart. Everyone else is stupid. Never mind. You're all idiots. You're idiots. So
[15254.92s -> 15256.92s]  No, not you guys. I'm no
[15258.20s -> 15263.42s]  I'll put words in my mouth. That's not what I said
[15264.06s -> 15269.52s]  It's not what I said. I mean it is what I said but I wasn't referring I was referring to these
[15270.40s -> 15271.60s]  These idiots
[15271.60s -> 15275.32s]  Okay, let's save it here
[15275.32s -> 15280.24s]  Somebody's mad in that room
[15280.24s -> 15293.21s]  Can I get him to come out?
[15304.40s -> 15330.30s]  Is he stuck? I think he's stuck in the wall. Um, I can't open the door
[15331.02s -> 15340.11s]  Well, I don't think I have to worry about that guy anymore
[15343.63s -> 15349.56s]  Okay, I heard a grunt and that
[15350.52s -> 15359.69s]  There was a loud grunt and then he stopped moving and his leg was sticking out of the wall
[15369.85s -> 15372.35s]  Wait, that's not you, is it?
[15390.76s -> 15401.92s]  You guys are the worst all right back to the shotgun
[15405.84s -> 15414.60s]  Mama. Oh, he didn't get stuck. He just walked back behind this way
[15416.44s -> 15418.44s]  And he walked the whole time
[15424.24s -> 15431.26s]  He walked a long way a very long way
[15432.06s -> 15435.39s]  It was actually in my favor though
[15442.36s -> 15443.64s]  I'm gonna use it
[15443.64s -> 15448.57s]  I need some big heavy weapons
[15448.65s -> 15451.92s]  There's a lot of those big guys now
[15452.40s -> 15454.16s]  So i'm gonna use it
[15454.16s -> 15455.68s]  on the big guys
[15455.68s -> 15462.59s]  Okay, this is
[15464.54s -> 15467.07s]  She's close now
[15467.07s -> 15470.67s]  Presence is strong here. Thanks for the info
[15471.31s -> 15483.87s]  nothing down
[15483.87s -> 15487.47s]  Who touched wait a heavy? No, i'm i'm just talking like straight up
[15488.19s -> 15489.71s]  like heavy
[15489.71s -> 15491.71s]  like a heavy gun
[15491.71s -> 15496.27s]  Like heavy weapons not the heavy weapons guy. Well, I mean a heavy weapons guy uses heavy weapons
[15506.25s -> 15508.56s]  Really?
[15509.61s -> 15512.81s]  What the fuck that guy's not it's so accurate with these
[15513.61s -> 15528.97s]  How is that guy not dead?
[15528.97s -> 15530.09s]  Okay
[15530.09s -> 15532.81s]  I need someone to explain how that guy's alive
[15533.85s -> 15538.25s]  I need someone to tell me what happened and why uh, where is he now?
[15544.94s -> 15546.94s]  He didn't but I shot him with
[15547.58s -> 15564.28s]  I killed him. What the fuck does he have for a gun?
[15565.08s -> 15568.20s]  Hold on. Okay. He has a repeating cannon
[15571.02s -> 15575.50s]  So these guys are much they're they're much harder. All right, I gotta bring out the real thing here
[15578.48s -> 15583.28s]  He's that's not gonna hit me. It's not gonna hit me. You're in a room by yourself
[15592.65s -> 15594.33s]  Oh, no your leg
[15594.33s -> 15599.29s]  Your leg is hurt
[15599.29s -> 15612.86s]  All right this thing look at this. I love what we dove out of the way too. Okay, let's check it
[15612.94s -> 15617.26s]  Is this thing gonna be good?
[15617.26s -> 15619.08s]  We'll try it
[15619.08s -> 15624.27s]  Repeating cannon nice. Okay, that gave me a lot of ammo for this
[15627.63s -> 15643.00s]  Very cool. Let's let's shoot somebody with this and see what happens good
[15643.96s -> 15649.50s]  Good up the ladder. This is the best weapon in the game
[15651.80s -> 15653.72s]  Uh, I wonder what it does
[15653.72s -> 15657.77s]  I'm looking forward to shooting my first person directly at the chest
[15658.41s -> 15667.20s]  This is where uh the little door that I couldn't go through earlier
[15667.84s -> 15681.22s]  Patrol
[15685.30s -> 15687.30s]  In more ways than one I think
[15687.94s -> 15691.58s]  Okay, I need that bad
[15691.66s -> 15696.72s]  Uh, do I have shark? Yeah, I got plenty of shark
[15700.48s -> 15704.11s]  It's very funny
[15704.11s -> 15707.31s]  I mean i'm just i'm just i'm just saying
[15707.95s -> 15711.41s]  I mean i'm just saying
[15711.41s -> 15723.09s]  Do I have any regular? Okay. I got a lot of regular grenades
[15723.97s -> 15739.41s]  It's a little too quiet
[15739.41s -> 15741.41s]  I knew it was quiet
[15749.71s -> 15770.03s]  I don't like that outcome. That's better
[15790.29s -> 15793.92s]  Okay, I actually like the shotgun for this better
[15794.88s -> 15807.87s]  Where is he?
[15807.87s -> 15815.10s]  There he is
[15815.10s -> 15817.74s]  Default shotgun is just the best weapon
[15819.02s -> 15821.65s]  No matter what scenario
[15821.73s -> 15833.06s]  It's just the best
[15833.54s -> 15840.00s]  That was a good face plant on the corner
[15840.32s -> 15856.45s]  All right. All right. All right
[15857.76s -> 15861.04s]  Where is he?
[15861.04s -> 15862.72s]  No, I think that's it
[15862.72s -> 15953.57s]  Nice work get banned for grenade spam. Keep at it. Keep at it. Keep at it. I'm coming. I'm coming
[15953.97s -> 15996.74s]  Is
[15996.74s -> 16005.63s]  Why did he go back? Come on. Come on. Come on
[16007.23s -> 16009.23s]  Come on, come on. Come on. Come on this way
[16011.30s -> 16013.94s]  Don't de aggro to your original spot. Yeah
[16017.42s -> 16020.54s]  I need that. I need you to step on that. I need this
[16023.74s -> 16037.70s]  Okay, i'm getting high ground here
[16039.81s -> 16065.33s]  Oh fuck
[16065.33s -> 16087.33s]  God damn it hit me right in the face. Now what you cheesed him?
[16087.89s -> 16091.41s]  How else are you supposed to kill those guys without cheesing them? That's the whole point
[16092.50s -> 16097.46s]  The entire point is to cheese that because it that it's impossible you you have to have to cheese that
[16133.28s -> 16138.14s]  Got it. That's probably a third one, too
[16138.62s -> 16143.62s]  I thought that was a gun. It's an arm
[16145.71s -> 16147.71s]  And I thought that was a frying pan
[16147.71s -> 16151.87s]  But it's a tire with a thing sticking out of it. I wasn't even gonna say anything, but I guess I just did
[16159.41s -> 16161.41s]  No healing sticks
[16162.51s -> 16164.51s]  This is the guy that beat yeah
[16166.61s -> 16169.57s]  I beat dark souls 3 on stream and i'm incredibly proud of it
[16170.61s -> 16172.29s]  and the dlc
[16172.29s -> 16183.76s]  That's not even an achievement anymore. He's here
[16185.28s -> 16187.28s]  Like I want to hear that conversation
[16190.40s -> 16198.85s]  I didn't know they were behind me at this point. It's okay. I want to hear that whole conversation
[16212.78s -> 16214.94s]  That's unbelievable how the fuck
[16216.29s -> 16218.29s]  Would you even rip around?
[16226.40s -> 16236.02s]  Yeah, okay. Yep. Come on out. Everything's fine. We got him that fucker's dead
[16236.58s -> 16255.57s]  Shoot him this way. Okay, it's time to just use my tried and true
[16272.72s -> 16274.72s]  He's here
[16274.80s -> 16293.36s]  He's talking to me like actually me or
[16309.84s -> 16312.32s]  I mean if i'm in that scenario and this super like
[16313.60s -> 16316.88s]  He's like sprinting around speed hacking and then just i'm gonna be like hey man
[16317.84s -> 16320.98s]  nice
[16320.98s -> 16322.98s]  What are you doing later? You want to like hang out?
[16323.47s -> 16326.59s]  I I guess I don't uh, no you did it good work
[16327.15s -> 16328.51s]  We're gonna do
[16328.51s -> 16332.88s]  And then when he and then be like, yeah, nice job when he's not looking
[16335.30s -> 16351.82s]  And then be like I did it. Where do I go? Oh if I have to touch what the hell is that what?
[16356.83s -> 16361.57s]  Okay
[16361.57s -> 16363.57s]  I guess you have this
[16363.97s -> 16408.00s]  Whole area back here. I don't have any at full health. So that's good. What is this attached to?
[16408.56s -> 16421.28s]  I get um
[16428.22s -> 16430.50s]  Kick some ass. Okay
[16430.50s -> 16432.58s]  Uh, so we can go down here
[16433.30s -> 16438.03s]  I was just in here. Oh, wait
[16438.67s -> 16443.94s]  I didn't look at this
[16443.94s -> 16448.02s]  No
[16448.02s -> 16452.66s]  I guess I don't need to do anything there. What about through here? It's like an elevator up there or something
[16457.36s -> 16459.36s]  Is this two skylights?
[16459.84s -> 16462.59s]  That just leads to this one
[16462.59s -> 16467.33s]  I'm getting nerd neck. Am I?
[16467.49s -> 16473.38s]  I feel like I have to do something with this
[16478.21s -> 16483.31s]  Can't like drop it
[16483.31s -> 16485.31s]  Obviously I have to get up there
[16486.66s -> 16488.66s]  Question is how?
[16489.06s -> 16492.59s]  Why can't I open?
[16492.59s -> 16494.59s]  This door didn't open last time
[16495.62s -> 16498.38s]  Why is it open now?
[16498.38s -> 16503.42s]  I I hope I tried to open it. I pressed I did you can go back and look. I really did. I promise
[16506.21s -> 16508.21s]  I did I really did
[16515.04s -> 16520.66s]  All right, let's go left
[16520.66s -> 16522.50s]  health upgrade
[16522.50s -> 16524.02s]  Yeah
[16524.02s -> 16525.54s]  175
[16525.54s -> 16534.98s]  What do I sound scared?
[16534.98s -> 16537.14s]  Um, i'm not scared. Um
[16539.22s -> 16542.90s]  Well, i'm a little i'm a little flush and queasy
[16543.62s -> 16545.46s]  But that's for other reasons
[16545.46s -> 16549.36s]  Did I just fall?
[16549.36s -> 16564.02s]  Who was that?
[16564.02s -> 16564.90s]  Uh
[16564.90s -> 16566.26s]  Here we go again
[16566.26s -> 16604.82s]  Hey, okay. I'm alive
[16606.61s -> 16609.01s]  And did I I didn't even go anywhere
[16609.73s -> 16620.72s]  Cool. You wasted ammo
[16620.72s -> 16622.72s]  Well, I they would have killed me
[16633.60s -> 16647.63s]  Thank you
[16647.63s -> 16655.89s]  incursion
[16655.89s -> 16657.89s]  locate ah
[16660.11s -> 16661.31s]  locate
[16661.31s -> 16664.70s]  wait
[16664.70s -> 16680.90s]  That didn't do anything
[16680.90s -> 16684.61s]  Dead dead
[16684.61s -> 16697.41s]  I'm glad you regenerate
[16697.41s -> 16701.34s]  To at least 25 that would be so
[16702.93s -> 16705.73s]  Awful if you didn't buy this on hard. It really doesn't matter
[16707.60s -> 16710.56s]  Because if you get shot like two or three times on hard you just die
[16711.28s -> 16716.90s]  So maybe that doesn't matter. That's no that's not an alarm, right?
[16733.15s -> 16735.15s]  Wait, just check the like health packs
[16736.08s -> 16738.32s]  I don't I I am in
[16738.96s -> 16740.96s]  The market for them. Here we are
[16742.24s -> 16745.36s]  And go that way
[16745.36s -> 16746.96s]  And go up here
[16746.96s -> 16752.58s]  Nothing. Okay
[16752.58s -> 16765.73s]  Let's check over this way
[16765.73s -> 16767.25s]  Multiple ways to go
[16767.25s -> 16774.21s]  I'm just gonna go through the vent
[16774.21s -> 16777.09s]  Oh, what are the oh nice. I haven't had these in a long time
[16777.81s -> 16783.57s]  I can't all right. Can I break this one?
[16784.69s -> 16787.60s]  I can't go through this
[16787.60s -> 16797.76s]  All right, let's just two grenades fine
[16797.76s -> 16803.84s]  Okay, let's go down
[16804.32s -> 16810.59s]  I don't think there's much else for me to do here
[16820.37s -> 16829.97s]  Still no health
[16829.97s -> 16845.90s]  Wait hidden. Nope. Hi guys
[16848.70s -> 16850.70s]  It's the last thing you're ever gonna say
[16882.54s -> 16889.74s]  Are you it's it's uh, it's garfield's human garfield
[16900.16s -> 16902.16s]  Do I get to kill human garfield now?
[16902.82s -> 16905.25s]  I really hope I do
[16905.25s -> 16906.29s]  Hey
[16906.29s -> 16908.50s]  Remember me
[16908.50s -> 16910.50s]  I'm coming for you
[16911.06s -> 16913.22s]  You don't have very much time remaining
[16913.78s -> 16950.42s]  That sucks. Let's go. I'm gonna pull out. What am I gonna do? Yeah. No. Yeah
[16951.14s -> 16955.92s]  It's part of the best. Let's do it
[16974.10s -> 16985.87s]  Best gun in the game that I do under the power of one guy
[16987.41s -> 16990.06s]  One guy
[16990.06s -> 17002.18s]  Can seriously change everything that's right attack me during a cutscene fucking coward
[17002.90s -> 17009.38s]  Coward attacks me during war coward. He's peeking around the side
[17014.72s -> 17019.73s]  Yeah, and now i'm gonna i'm gonna make your life a living hell. I'm killing you with the scary gun
[17063.10s -> 17066.22s]  Yeah, that is that is I was gonna say the same thing. He took the words right out of my mouth
[17066.94s -> 17068.94s]  That's really fucked up. Okay
[17069.18s -> 17074.06s]  Let's go up
[17074.06s -> 17093.14s]  Go up and can I crawl over?
[17093.38s -> 17096.00s]  I think I can crawl over the whole thing
[17098.27s -> 17100.27s]  Oh, that's sick. Nice
[17100.35s -> 17105.02s]  All right
[17105.02s -> 17110.58s]  I'm gonna drop in on him
[17110.64s -> 17130.11s]  Spider-man meets fear. Why would it be spider-man? He's not in here again
[17132.14s -> 17134.54s]  When is the final confrontation gonna be with this guy?
[17135.62s -> 17137.78s]  He keeps just barely getting away
[17139.68s -> 17165.63s]  Come on. I mean i'm gonna do what i'm gonna do. It's me. It's my life
[17166.35s -> 17168.35s]  so i'm gonna decide what I
[17169.15s -> 17173.79s]  I decided to shoot that guy because he was he was dangerous to me
[17174.43s -> 17190.99s]  These are all explosive
[17204.34s -> 17207.15s]  Yes
[17207.15s -> 17209.15s]  All right full health pretty much
[17209.39s -> 17211.33s]  That's all I need
[17211.33s -> 17215.49s]  Just like my father when we used to play
[17215.97s -> 17217.74s]  mario brothers
[17217.74s -> 17219.34s]  see my dad
[17219.34s -> 17223.90s]  was not like necessarily really great at video games, but we had the regular nintendo
[17225.41s -> 17226.53s]  and
[17226.53s -> 17230.69s]  What he would tell us to do we had regular just super mario brothers, right?
[17231.33s -> 17234.29s]  And he would tell us if we got him to the last level
[17235.01s -> 17237.01s]  with five lives
[17237.17s -> 17239.41s]  That he would beat the game for us because we couldn't do it
[17240.56s -> 17246.08s]  So we would always just try to get to the end and get have five lives and hand and be like dad
[17246.48s -> 17249.92s]  Dad, you have to beat the game. We got five lives at bowser's castle
[17250.80s -> 17255.41s]  And he'd come over be like, all right, excuse me. Let me sit down and he would do it every time
[17256.29s -> 17261.09s]  But we had to have five lives though because there was a couple places where he knew he was gonna die like three or four times
[17262.05s -> 17269.04s]  Uh, how do I I guess we're going this way
[17272.67s -> 17275.55s]  Gamer dad it was only with that though. It was only with mario brothers
[17276.35s -> 17279.49s]  He didn't really play anything else
[17279.49s -> 17283.65s]  It was it was pretty wonderful
[17286.91s -> 17289.31s]  But he wouldn't beat the game for us
[17290.43s -> 17291.47s]  What?
[17291.47s -> 17294.86s]  I had nothing to do with that one
[17299.73s -> 17302.74s]  Uh-oh
[17302.74s -> 17305.31s]  Uh-oh
[17305.31s -> 17307.31s]  Okay, we're gonna have to do this strategically
[17307.95s -> 17355.22s]  One more I could use the force to find out what the fuck this thing is back in the regular shotgun, please
[17355.94s -> 17376.40s]  Gentlemen not a very good hiding
[17382.88s -> 17384.88s]  Oh, it's not explosive. Come on
[17418.67s -> 17422.03s]  He saw it was a silent under the breath of shit
[17423.63s -> 17430.59s]  You did there you're the one that killed me. You're the one that finally got rid of me. You finally killed me
[17431.39s -> 17433.39s]  Outplayed me completely
[17434.90s -> 17438.54s]  Shit I love this game so much
[17439.60s -> 17441.04s]  It's so
[17441.04s -> 17443.04s]  That's so stupid
[17453.31s -> 17467.44s]  Which way oh my god, what a fucking fun game
[17477.74s -> 17479.74s]  Uh, these guys are
[17481.74s -> 17487.57s]  I feel bad
[17487.73s -> 17495.52s]  What the fuck
[17495.76s -> 17508.96s]  Why is he not skeleton? Oh, no, no, no, no
[17512.32s -> 17518.59s]  Panicking I panicked like a lot a lot
[17531.73s -> 17534.74s]  Whoa
[17535.06s -> 17557.36s]  More health, right? That's not a terrible place to be in
[17558.16s -> 17560.85s]  I'm gonna die down here
[17560.85s -> 17562.37s]  Turn off the light
[17562.37s -> 17563.97s]  Reload the gun
[17563.97s -> 17567.09s]  And get ready for that and we're gonna do a wall bounce here
[17570.66s -> 17574.05s]  No, I don't think I need to
[17575.76s -> 17578.24s]  He backed into it. He stepped. Uh, you idiot
[17584.66s -> 17587.54s]  Did you kill everybody too? You did nice work
[17593.36s -> 17602.21s]  He's over here. Did I overthrow that?
[17617.06s -> 17619.70s]  I got him. I got that guy. I really did
[17620.50s -> 17636.54s]  What's over here?
[17636.54s -> 17639.44s]  Nothing. Okay
[17639.44s -> 17644.24s]  What in here? No
[17645.44s -> 17648.29s]  You're locking me in
[17648.29s -> 17653.41s]  They're locking me in
[17653.41s -> 17655.41s]  Fine. I'll just go down the sewer
[17665.60s -> 17667.60s]  I'm your favorite centipede streamer
[17683.60s -> 17709.55s]  Okay down we go, okay, I did that on purpose because I did I took a lot of damage for no reason
[17731.34s -> 17733.34s]  That was pretty brutal
[17734.54s -> 17736.54s]  Sorry about that. All right
[17745.41s -> 17772.72s]  Oh shit, he's coming down here. Goodbye. What was that? All right, there's the little shortcut
[17773.28s -> 17776.98s]  Get out of here
[17776.98s -> 17778.98s]  Up and under let's go
[17779.06s -> 17798.13s]  All right, there's traps everywhere just activate them
[17800.83s -> 17803.15s]  Shit, I may have fucked that up. It's all right
[17806.83s -> 17808.83s]  Well, whatever. I'm just gonna walk this way. Anyways
[17821.86s -> 17823.86s]  You check it out. I don't want to go over there
[17825.46s -> 17846.27s]  Couple of dopes
[17846.27s -> 17849.07s]  Somebody needs to make a fire extinguisher smash super cut
[17852.29s -> 17863.34s]  It's just available for me. So I do it and then turn this
[17866.56s -> 17870.48s]  No, i'm not exactly sure what that did, but it did something. So let's go up
[17878.16s -> 17879.44s]  It's just a
[17879.44s -> 17881.44s]  It's just a thing that I know
[17881.60s -> 17883.60s]  You know what I mean? It's routine
[17884.48s -> 17891.04s]  In a game with scary jump scares and all kinds of weird fucked up enemies. This is routine for me. It's comfortable
[17891.52s -> 17899.84s]  Okay, I can't go anywhere
[17915.58s -> 17916.94s]  Is it kill me
[17916.94s -> 17927.38s]  Unless I don't fuck it up. I'll be fine
[17927.70s -> 17935.06s]  Here we go. Costco is garbage tier pizza
[17935.78s -> 17940.19s]  Why would you eat Costco pizza?
[17944.16s -> 17945.44s]  Is it good?
[17945.44s -> 17947.06s]  I don't know
[17947.06s -> 17951.12s]  Because it's good
[17951.12s -> 17953.44s]  It's pizza tier list. It's good and cheap
[17955.78s -> 17960.50s]  I thought Costco is where you go buy like 40 tubes of toothpaste
[17972.86s -> 17975.10s]  No, hey, I wanted to do that
[17976.93s -> 17980.72s]  Why is it on tv?
[17980.72s -> 17982.72s]  That was so anticlimactic
[17996.10s -> 17997.62s]  He just like
[17997.62s -> 18007.90s]  I just wanted to do I want to do what needs to be done. Come on like that guy can't like get thrown into like a
[18008.62s -> 18010.62s]  One of like the silos or something
[18011.62s -> 18014.66s]  Well, yes, we're gonna slide kick his corpse off. Yes, that's don't worry
[18019.50s -> 18025.71s]  You think i'm not going to do that
[18025.71s -> 18028.05s]  Those things open every time
[18028.05s -> 18031.01s]  Those notebooks just go like that when you go near them
[18031.73s -> 18033.73s]  It's actually really strange
[18041.70s -> 18043.70s]  He's gonna be like hero
[18044.10s -> 18046.58s]  Come over here
[18046.58s -> 18051.25s]  There's one last thing I need to tell you right? Why is he like happy?
[18051.81s -> 18060.86s]  The only way in
[18060.86s -> 18070.37s]  Is to divert power to the door. Divert power to the vault door
[18073.04s -> 18074.24s]  I can't
[18074.24s -> 18075.76s]  You can't slide him off
[18075.76s -> 18083.57s]  One last meal for you
[18083.57s -> 18099.22s]  Still hungry
[18099.22s -> 18107.54s]  Why did I die from that? All right, tell me again
[18108.18s -> 18115.95s]  The only way in
[18115.95s -> 18117.95s]  Is to divert power to the door
[18118.11s -> 18131.25s]  Okay, i'll see if I can divert some power
[18133.92s -> 18139.28s]  You hang tight guy that'll be dead when I get back lying down further on his back and not breathing
[18140.16s -> 18148.96s]  see
[18148.96s -> 18160.91s]  Oh, i'm gonna go down this way
[18160.99s -> 18170.66s]  nothing
[18170.66s -> 18176.50s]  What the fuck do you keep doing that so well?
[18177.14s -> 18180.86s]  I'm gonna die
[18180.86s -> 18183.18s]  He's throwing another one. He's trying to throw another one
[18187.63s -> 18205.98s]  Turn off the flashlight
[18205.98s -> 18210.43s]  What is that? Oh, I guess I got health
[18212.85s -> 18213.89s]  Okay
[18213.89s -> 18217.82s]  Here we go
[18217.82s -> 18219.82s]  I'm taking this out. This thing is
[18221.18s -> 18225.02s]  You fucker
[18242.72s -> 18264.93s]  Really? All right. I need to start using the other gun. Did you drop one of these two? Didn't you? I guess not
[18264.93s -> 18267.42s]  All right. This thing's gotta be used
[18267.42s -> 18269.42s]  Get the fire extinguishers. No, i'm over that. No
[18269.98s -> 18280.10s]  I don't do that anymore
[18280.10s -> 18288.93s]  Say right
[18288.93s -> 18290.56s]  nice
[18290.56s -> 18294.08s]  Yeah, i'm over that i'm more into the magic notebook's opening though
[18294.64s -> 18296.48s]  I want to open those
[18296.48s -> 18297.68s]  fucking
[18297.68s -> 18299.68s]  Fire extinguishers are old news guys
[18300.24s -> 18317.10s]  Do we have power?
[18317.10s -> 18318.94s]  Is that what that means?
[18318.94s -> 18320.54s]  We're connected
[18320.54s -> 18327.95s]  We have a signal
[18327.95s -> 18334.83s]  Maybe I can't believe I used to do that shit
[18336.60s -> 18372.94s]  Embarrassing. Oh, let's just go check it. I thought that was damn it
[18374.06s -> 18376.62s]  Do I have to do both sides?
[18376.94s -> 18380.27s]  I mean that was a pretty elaborate
[18380.35s -> 18387.81s]  Thing that happened. Is it open? This does not look like it's open
[18389.38s -> 18391.38s]  It is not I have to do them both
[18391.78s -> 18424.08s]  So let's go this side. Did I go down here already? Did I was there on this side?
[18427.34s -> 18436.45s]  Yeah, it's already are they connected is both both sides the same thing
[18437.01s -> 18446.75s]  Do I have that right? Do I just have to do something else down there?
[18447.31s -> 18450.75s]  Or do I have to actually go to the other side and this is the side that I was on before
[18451.47s -> 18454.00s]  This went the wrong way. Yeah, that's what i'm figuring
[18467.14s -> 18467.94s]  so
[18467.94s -> 18469.94s]  Theoretically now i'm on the other side
[18471.09s -> 18473.23s]  No, i'm not
[18473.23s -> 18475.55s]  Am I? I'm fucking confused
[18476.27s -> 18483.10s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[18483.18s -> 18484.75s]  uh
[18484.75s -> 18490.46s]  Okay, so
[18490.46s -> 18492.34s]  They are connected
[18492.42s -> 18494.42s]  They're they're they are connected
[18495.22s -> 18497.81s]  so
[18497.81s -> 18499.97s]  I have to go back down to where I was before
[18505.15s -> 18510.38s]  Because they would that that device was down there. So
[18511.74s -> 18515.82s]  I don't it's not about two different sides. It's just going back down there and
[18516.62s -> 18518.22s]  pressing more buttons
[18518.22s -> 18524.11s]  Because I went right last time
[18524.19s -> 18528.19s]  Okay. Yeah, I thought I had to go like on the other side and there was another one of these
[18528.99s -> 18541.47s]  All right. This is double yellow
[18546.91s -> 18548.91s]  We have both the yellow switches in
[18552.26s -> 18553.54s]  Whatever the
[18553.54s -> 18562.82s]  Whatever that means
[18562.82s -> 18564.10s]  so now
[18564.10s -> 18571.65s]  Is that enough? Does that open another door to do the blue ones now?
[18573.98s -> 18574.94s]  I don't know
[18574.94s -> 18584.72s]  Or is that just power?
[18584.72s -> 18590.06s]  Well, this door is the two yellow now. I gotta find the two blue. All right, that's what you gotta do
[18618.80s -> 18630.80s]  All right, is he alive? Anybody else alive up here? I don't believe so
[18632.54s -> 18634.90s]  No, you're dead
[18634.90s -> 18636.90s]  Just making sure you're actually dead
[18637.22s -> 18655.63s]  Does that say caution no, this guy used to be my favorite fire extinguisher smasher
[18656.35s -> 18678.96s]  Sure, whatever you say. Let's get up there if I can
[18679.92s -> 18691.70s]  So I need to get up there. But what's secret? Is it great right there?
[18693.54s -> 18695.38s]  oh
[18695.38s -> 18696.58s]  Nice
[18696.58s -> 18699.30s]  I didn't know there's a magic notebook up there fucking sick
[18707.81s -> 18714.18s]  He's over this game. No, no, I'm not. I really am not i'm just a little drained
[18716.11s -> 18719.47s]  But that has nothing to do with the game it has to do with me
[18722.37s -> 18724.67s]  oh
[18724.67s -> 18726.83s]  Every fucking time it's awesome
[18730.08s -> 18736.42s]  Oh, there's other magic books
[18736.42s -> 18738.19s]  All right. So now
[18738.19s -> 18740.56s]  This is two yellow so I can open it
[18740.56s -> 18742.14s]  Nice
[18742.14s -> 18744.14s]  Hey, look at me. I'm up here
[18744.22s -> 18755.41s]  I hear something. Finally. I have two health. I haven't had two health packs in probably an
[18763.09s -> 18775.97s]  What is in the wall? All right long range think I can get it. No
[18776.37s -> 18778.37s]  I don't like it matters
[18778.37s -> 18780.80s]  Somebody somebody threw a grenade
[18780.80s -> 18784.64s]  And it hit me right in the head
[18784.64s -> 18786.64s]  I'm stuck in i'm stuck right now
[18789.65s -> 18797.07s]  I don't like that outcome
[18824.56s -> 18835.84s]  Fucking the grenades the grenades I got double tapped. I'm just going in fuck it
[18839.22s -> 18841.22s]  out of my way
[18841.22s -> 18878.08s]  What does he have for a weapon?
[18882.59s -> 18886.75s]  No, I don't want the outcome here. All right, let's go. Um, i'm actually done fucking around
[18887.95s -> 18947.94s]  That's fun. Where's the guy with the rocket launcher? He got I think it's serious there for a second even though I took two health packs
[18948.74s -> 18956.91s]  Streamer dies to grenade and goes bald
[18960.14s -> 18961.66s]  one of these days
[18961.66s -> 18965.84s]  Here's the real here. Listen, this is important one of these days
[18966.48s -> 18970.88s]  You know, let's say I stream for like another let's say I keep streaming for like another five to ten years
[18971.52s -> 18972.82s]  right
[18972.82s -> 18976.74s]  There's going to be a scenario where i'm going to actually be truly bald
[18977.38s -> 18979.78s]  Like an m on the top of my head back here
[18982.02s -> 18984.34s]  And you guys are gonna have so much fun
[18984.98s -> 18994.18s]  I want this up. Isn't that too yellow?
[19005.54s -> 19016.29s]  Um, i'm gonna go up. Can I even go up anymore?
[19017.41s -> 19022.03s]  nice
[19022.03s -> 19029.50s]  confused
[19029.50s -> 19031.50s]  Glitch it out and get up there
[19036.18s -> 19046.96s]  Because this door doesn't open I get up here. So why can't I get this door open?
[19047.68s -> 19065.09s]  Is there a problem with this? Why can't I open the toilet room? That means I have to go back through
[19065.97s -> 19093.57s]  Where do I go? No one tell him. Wait, maybe no one tell him
[19101.34s -> 19104.77s]  All right, is this blue?
[19104.77s -> 19106.21s]  Blue blue
[19106.21s -> 19135.95s]  She's not in there. Line like round, right? Here blue is not ready. Where is it?
[19143.06s -> 19179.62s]  Wait, wait, wait, what's going on there? What is this in the way? What do you mean? We'll fucking get rid of it. Okay
[19181.06s -> 19213.09s]  There we go. We got dated upload get it uploaded. Get over here. That's it. Now plug the damn thing in
[19221.20s -> 19222.88s]  Be on shoulder
[19222.88s -> 19238.10s]  Will you guys relax and then I gotta go through that door
[19241.17s -> 19243.17s]  Blue blue, right? There it is
[19248.59s -> 19252.46s]  Cool. Let's go
[19252.46s -> 19254.46s]  Now I need red
[19258.70s -> 19270.94s]  Red and red and that's it. You have bees all over your skin
[19272.18s -> 19274.18s]  Shit, I should probably go to the doctor
[19283.90s -> 19289.23s]  Cool. All right. So that leads me to now. I need to go back to the door
[19290.03s -> 19292.91s]  That I just was at because that won't open
[19293.63s -> 19301.52s]  But now it should open now. I wonder if my hypothesis is going to be correct
[19302.00s -> 19322.46s]  It is okay. Well
[19331.12s -> 19369.23s]  Hey, hey, why is it why is it just dust out of here? All right, i've had enough of this
[19370.05s -> 19371.89s]  I hate these things
[19371.89s -> 19374.61s]  How the fuck you rely you're supposed to kill these things without them

[19384.02s -> 19396.82s]  I remember when I thought that was fun
[19400.88s -> 19402.08s]  memories
[19402.08s -> 19405.47s]  It's like looking at an old photo
[19405.55s -> 19435.68s]  No, I don't where are the items?
[19435.68s -> 19437.76s]  That's new
[19437.76s -> 19441.02s]  What's in there? Who knows?
[19441.62s -> 19445.23s]  We'll never know till I go this way

[19480.69s -> 19482.69s]  No, fuck that thing. Okay
[19483.78s -> 19485.46s]  So what is this for
[19485.46s -> 19487.06s]  Something to do with this
[19487.06s -> 19489.74s]  What do I need to do with this thing?
[19491.20s -> 19492.96s]  I tried shooting it
[19492.96s -> 19497.49s]  Is something else here wouldn't grab if I put some barrels in here?
[19500.53s -> 19510.80s]  Shoot the ones that explode
[19510.80s -> 19514.05s]  Get inside
[19514.05s -> 19516.05s]  Okay, get inside
[19524.70s -> 19527.42s]  That's a lot but whatever I hear those
[19528.62s -> 19540.21s]  stupid robots
[19540.61s -> 19542.61s]  They're in like the ceiling
[19542.93s -> 19553.15s]  Did I go in
[19553.15s -> 19569.95s]  Maybe I should go in I need to get up there. Can I just walk over there? I sure can

[20238.30s -> 20242.74s]  20 minutes of the game to realize it's a fun weapon. It's not as good as the super shotgun
[20248.19s -> 20258.90s]  Which way this way

[20626.66s -> 20628.66s]  I've been able to punch the whole game
[20631.30s -> 20635.04s]  No
[20635.04s -> 20638.00s]  Oh, but there's so much fun things I could have done

[20646.82s -> 20653.55s]  The other one what I don't even know where it is. It exploded and flew away. That's great

[20767.47s -> 20772.27s]  Now this is a way scarier game than the last
[20773.41s -> 20799.87s]  Seven to eight straight hours of this game. I've tried so hard to forget
[20833.47s -> 20836.74s]  You were born in this place
[20839.39s -> 20841.39s]  Place I was there
[20841.95s -> 20843.39s]  This place
[20843.39s -> 20845.39s]  That's me
[20845.39s -> 20847.23s]  That's me
[20847.23s -> 20849.23s]  Making those noises

[20939.25s -> 20950.22s]  Rick did I do it? That doesn't seem right
[20955.97s -> 20964.43s]  That's not right that's incorrect that doesn't seem like the right uh, can I get back in the room go back in this room?
[20965.98s -> 20967.98s]  Go quick. Go get in the bathtub
[20968.54s -> 20972.22s]  Go get in the bathtub. That's what you're supposed to do. Go get in the bathtub

[20991.26s -> 20995.74s]  Silly moments before signal was lost efforts to reestablish link on successful status of fear operative unknown
[21019.02s -> 21021.02s]  I'm
[21024.86s -> 21026.86s]  Since the explosion
[21029.57s -> 21032.26s]  What happened to us?
[21038.10s -> 21040.53s]  What how is that epilogue
[21044.59s -> 21046.03s]  epilogue
[21046.03s -> 21049.74s]  We just we just watched it
[21050.30s -> 21052.64s]  mushroom cloud and then
[21052.64s -> 21054.88s]  The ring lady went in the end of the helicopter
[21055.60s -> 21066.02s]  It's got to set us up for fear, too
[21066.02s -> 21068.10s]  The helicopter you're on got attacked again
[21068.90s -> 21071.74s]  attacked again
[21071.74s -> 21072.70s]  Yeah
[21072.70s -> 21077.65s]  Either the how long are the expansions?
[21082.11s -> 21084.83s]  Are they a couple hours each or how do they play out?
[21088.54s -> 21090.54s]  Four hours. That's not bad
[21091.74s -> 21093.02s]  well
[21093.02s -> 21095.02s]  So here's here's what we're going to do for the next
[21095.02s -> 21097.02s]  Uh a few days
[21097.34s -> 21099.34s]  I'm not going to be streaming tomorrow
[21100.94s -> 21102.70s]  But we are going to go
[21102.70s -> 21109.15s]  Stop falling over. We are going to do uh, I originally was going to do today yesterday
[21109.71s -> 21113.07s]  And then saturday sunday, but we're going to do saturday sunday monday
[21117.73s -> 21118.77s]  so
[21118.77s -> 21123.01s]  We'll instead of doing four days. We'll do like five for the last six days
[21125.60s -> 21127.60s]  And what's on the list?
[21128.34s -> 21133.70s]  There are a few things actually there's rhythm games, which i'm probably going to break up the horror stuff
[21135.41s -> 21138.91s]  But we are eventually going to make our way to this
[21139.63s -> 21145.26s]  This is siren for the playstation 2
[21148.38s -> 21150.03s]  and
[21150.03s -> 21154.24s]  and
[21154.24s -> 21159.36s]  Last of the probably the horror games that i'm going to put at least some significant time in
[21160.32s -> 21164.85s]  Is this one?
[21164.85s -> 21166.85s]  We've got some interesting stuff for sure
[21170.93s -> 21174.13s]  The thing in siren are probably the how we're going to round out and then the halloween stream
[21175.87s -> 21179.23s]  Now that's a yeah, i've heard i've never played this
[21183.23s -> 21185.47s]  That game is hard as sin. Well, it's all right
[21186.93s -> 21189.01s]  You guys can help me
[21189.01s -> 21194.59s]  You guys can help me out in these ones. So don't worry, but i'm not streaming tomorrow
[21195.31s -> 21197.47s]  i'm just gonna try to gain some energy
[21199.25s -> 21200.77s]  and hopefully
[21200.77s -> 21202.21s]  by
[21202.21s -> 21204.21s]  The end of this week. I'll be a little bit more
[21205.33s -> 21208.05s]  Used to me having to use this medication
[21208.85s -> 21212.45s]  Because i'm really only going to be on it for another probably four or five days
[21214.18s -> 21215.54s]  so
[21215.54s -> 21217.62s]  Yeah, do less cocaine
[21218.91s -> 21222.51s]  Yes, and by less i mean you mean zero and by zero you mean never
[21227.46s -> 21232.34s]  Yeah, i'm really i'm just doing less cocaine over the last of the next few weeks
[21233.44s -> 21245.68s]  Jesus christ
[21245.68s -> 21247.68s]  Jerma strikes me as an e guy
[21248.40s -> 21251.92s]  No, jerma should strike you as a guy that likes salad and bananas
[21252.40s -> 21256.48s]  He likes eating salads and bananas and sometimes he has like captain crunch sometimes
[21260.64s -> 21264.26s]  What?
[21264.26s -> 21268.58s]  I like I don't do drugs. That's what i'm saying. I don't do drugs
[21270.26s -> 21272.26s]  I don't do drugs
[21273.55s -> 21276.13s]  I don't do drugs
[21280.24s -> 21282.24s]  That's not true. I'm on them right now
[21284.82s -> 21286.50s]  Oh
[21286.58s -> 21288.58s]  I mean like prescription
[21289.14s -> 21291.57s]  for prescription
[21291.57s -> 21293.57s]  Hey, thanks for watching everybody
[21304.32s -> 21306.32s]  I'll see you. Uh on the next one
[21307.79s -> 21311.55s]  Not tomorrow, but the next day and the next day and then we'll do three days in a row after tomorrow
[21313.79s -> 21315.79s]  i'm gonna spend most of tomorrow just
[21318.10s -> 21320.10s]  Trying to energize again
[21320.10s -> 21322.98s]  I've just been so tired. This
[21323.06s -> 21327.94s]  It's definitely the med this medicine is making me so fucking exhausted. I don't even know why it shouldn't
[21328.90s -> 21331.71s]  I just broke all my bones
[21335.33s -> 21337.33s]  But you do what you gotta do, right?
[21337.57s -> 21342.16s]  Someone just wrote good
[21342.16s -> 21345.74s]  What's wrong with some of you guys?
[21347.31s -> 21349.07s]  Why?
[21349.07s -> 21350.11s]  All right
[21350.11s -> 21352.11s]  Uh, i'll see you guys on
[21352.19s -> 21355.55s]  No, what's today? Hold on. Let me look at the let me look at the actual what I want to do
[21355.63s -> 21358.35s]  Yeah, so tuesday wednesday friday saturday sunday
[21360.94s -> 21363.63s]  Yeah, that sounds good to me
[21363.71s -> 21364.99s]  and then
[21364.99s -> 21367.25s]  I gotta hold on. I gotta really plan this out because
[21369.66s -> 21371.66s]  If I do saturday sunday monday
[21371.90s -> 21374.59s]  And then maybe
[21374.59s -> 21377.71s]  Because the halloween stream is going to take a few days to set up
[21381.76s -> 21383.76s]  So now that there'll be plenty of time to do at least
[21384.48s -> 21388.16s]  Because before how the halloween stream i'll be live how many more times
[21390.21s -> 21392.21s]  See one two three
[21392.61s -> 21394.61s]  We'll get some rhythm games done
[21395.14s -> 21397.14s]  And then it'd be like one or two
[21397.14s -> 21399.14s]  Or one day there two days off there
[21399.94s -> 21404.58s]  And then like one two, three four. Yeah, there's definitely plenty of time to do at least one. All right. Let me ask you then
[21405.22s -> 21406.66s]  So I can plan this
[21406.66s -> 21409.62s]  What would you rather see over the course of a couple of streams?
[21410.67s -> 21412.51s]  the thing or siren
[21412.51s -> 21414.16s]  because
[21414.16s -> 21416.48s]  There's only really one of them that I could do and get it done
[21417.12s -> 21418.86s]  I would assume
[21418.86s -> 21421.02s]  I'm gonna do a straw poll right now where there's still people here
[21427.82s -> 21431.82s]  If I can do them both I will if I can if I can make that happen
[21431.82s -> 21436.06s]  But i'm pretty sure both these games are at least 12 to 15 plus hours long
[21439.20s -> 21441.92s]  And look if if it's not interesting I could you know
[21442.56s -> 21448.88s]  And move on
[21448.88s -> 21450.88s]  They both are gonna be interesting
[21451.70s -> 21456.10s]  just because I you know, I did a little bit of research to see
[21456.98s -> 21458.98s]  What's the thing the thing?
[21459.06s -> 21461.94s]  Is the sequel to the movie?
[21463.25s -> 21465.49s]  It's actually I believe it is actual canon
[21466.30s -> 21469.02s]  This is like what they did for a sequel
[21470.37s -> 21481.42s]  The thing is a sequel to the actual the thing movie and this is still very close
[21485.28s -> 21488.96s]  Yeah, you have like a squad in this game and you have to control everybody's emotions
[21490.78s -> 21494.86s]  People sometimes don't trust you. They think that you're the thing instead. It just seems like a
[21495.58s -> 21498.06s]  fun experience at least for a couple of streams
[21506.18s -> 21508.18s]  And siren from my understanding
[21508.66s -> 21510.82s]  Is a game where you control multiple?
[21512.16s -> 21513.94s]  protagonists
[21513.94s -> 21516.10s]  You choose a protagonist that you want to play
[21517.14s -> 21519.22s]  For that particular chapter or something, right?
[21522.38s -> 21524.38s]  They both seem pretty interesting
[21526.14s -> 21531.10s]  And siren siren is going to be probably much scarier than the thing. The thing is going to be more
[21532.30s -> 21534.46s]  third person creepy gross
[21535.58s -> 21539.34s]  Action game whereas siren is I believe an actual horror scary game
[21543.01s -> 21548.91s]  But uh, i'm i'm gonna call this here in a second if you have not decided if you've not picked
[21549.63s -> 21551.63s]  I suggest you do because it is very close
[21557.95s -> 21559.95s]  They're both horror games
[21559.95s -> 21562.19s]  They both are technically horror games
[21562.83s -> 21565.86s]  But I think siren is just a
[21567.22s -> 21568.74s]  scarier game
[21568.74s -> 21570.74s]  And the thing is more actiony
[21571.68s -> 21574.00s]  The thing is probably more like fear was
[21586.42s -> 21590.05s]  All right. Can you re-vote? What do you mean re-vote?
[21594.46s -> 21596.46s]  re-vote
[21602.94s -> 21604.94s]  You didn't know what the games were
[21606.82s -> 21609.70s]  Wait, so if you didn't know what they were, why did you pick one?
[21611.79s -> 21616.59s]  I said, what would you rather see me play this or this? It's like, ah this one, but it's like, all right. Well
[21624.21s -> 21626.21s]  Shut up, just let me re-vote
[21629.74s -> 21632.86s]  They're both very good apparently so don't worry and i'm gonna play
[21633.50s -> 21637.82s]  I didn't get them to not play them. I just which one would you which one would you rather see first?
[21641.44s -> 21644.94s]  All right. All right. That's it. That's it. We're doing the thing
[21645.50s -> 21660.67s]  That's the one we're gonna be doing the thing
[21663.20s -> 21665.70s]  And the siren will happen
[21665.70s -> 21671.97s]  Probably immediately after it. Let me change my vote
[21672.77s -> 21674.45s]  mad face
[21674.45s -> 21676.45s]  No, wait, you'll see them both. Don't worry
[21680.38s -> 21682.38s]  What is this
[21683.58s -> 21685.09s]  All right
[21685.09s -> 21689.01s]  I love this game. All right, I'll give my my final thoughts on the urgent of the fear
[21690.19s -> 21693.39s]  No, not the the it's not the thing. It's it's not the fear on fear
[21695.18s -> 21699.28s]  That was very good. It was just fun
[21700.42s -> 21706.02s]  And that's all you want out of a video game. Yeah, I just it's it was just fun
[21707.31s -> 21711.55s]  They got a little repetitive in a couple places, but it was still fun. I still liked it
[21713.68s -> 21717.55s]  Good stuff. All right. Let's do the
[21718.51s -> 21721.06s]  Let's do the bits
[21721.06s -> 21723.68s]  Have them open here from earlier
[21723.92s -> 21729.95s]  And if you take it off, we'll see you again this weekend
[21732.59s -> 21734.19s]  for a
[21734.19s -> 21738.67s]  Saturday Sunday and then monday extravaganza three days in a row will do
[21746.64s -> 21751.20s]  But I thought no, it was great. I loved in nearly every second of playing fear
[21751.84s -> 21754.80s]  It was great
[21754.80s -> 21758.16s]  And the oh shit stuff is is it gonna be stuck there forever in my brain?
[21758.96s -> 21762.74s]  All right. We'll see you on uh on Saturday if you're leaving
[21763.92s -> 21765.20s]  Thanks for joining us
[21765.20s -> 21770.88s]  And for the rest of you, we've got a few things to talk about we've got some bits to do
[21771.36s -> 21781.09s]  Let's go back to earlier today
[21782.88s -> 21784.72s]  We had 300 bits from
[21784.72s -> 21786.16s]  kore
[21786.16s -> 21788.40s]  Who says hello, mr streamer. Hope you're feeling good today
[21789.20s -> 21793.84s]  Uh, it's cool. You're doing eu friendly streams now. Also, do you think you'll play planet zoo when it comes out?
[21794.94s -> 21796.32s]  Uh, absolutely
[21796.32s -> 21799.82s]  I just didn't want to play the beta because I wanted to do the complete game
[21800.70s -> 21803.18s]  I didn't want to be limited by anything and that that's not I
[21803.82s -> 21807.18s]  Hold on this top sub gifter thing is just all fucked up. I'm gonna change it
[21807.74s -> 21816.18s]  Okay, here we go. Let's try it again. If it's still me. All right, if this is still me i'm going to uninstall stream labs. OBS
[21818.26s -> 21827.10s]  All right, it's gone
[21827.10s -> 21833.89s]  Okay, it's gone. All right. Uh, but anyways
[21834.53s -> 21837.15s]  Yeah, planet zoo. I just
[21837.31s -> 21841.95s]  Limited in the sense that I it's not like oh i'm so good at these games and i'm so talented
[21841.95s -> 21845.79s]  And so creative with all of my my I look at my habitats. I've no
[21846.59s -> 21850.19s]  But I just want all the animals. I just want to I just want access to everything
[21855.57s -> 21857.57s]  And that's coming out soon, isn't it?
[21858.05s -> 21868.99s]  What are the rhythm games gonna be? They've got a parapher the rapper parapher the rapper too. I'm jammer lamby buster groove
[21869.39s -> 21870.83s]  guitaro man
[21870.83s -> 21872.83s]  and uh
[21872.83s -> 21876.40s]  What's the other one? It's like one more
[21880.08s -> 21882.08s]  Is at least uh one more that I have?
[21882.16s -> 21888.19s]  Yeah, all great games. Yeah guitaro man is god tier. Oh, yeah
[21889.15s -> 21891.65s]  And guess what?
[21891.65s -> 21893.81s]  I've never played it
[21893.81s -> 21899.41s]  I saw it in stores. I've seen people play it. I've never held the controller in my hand and played guitaro man
[21900.13s -> 21907.07s]  So it's gonna be blind
[21907.07s -> 21912.80s]  Can't wait, but yeah, i've dialed the streams back a couple hours just because I know
[21913.87s -> 21915.87s]  that living in pacific
[21915.95s -> 21917.95s]  Daylight time still whatever it is
[21918.35s -> 21923.71s]  Streams get late for everybody. So I don't want to start at like four o'clock anymore starting around one or two is much better
[21924.43s -> 21926.91s]  For everybody me included
[21926.91s -> 21929.71s]  So yeah, i'm happy that people think it's a good start
[21930.94s -> 21932.94s]  Sad vega. Thanks for the 250
[21934.05s -> 21938.45s]  Your voicemail question is nonsense. I left one about 10 minutes ago and got a call back
[21939.09s -> 21943.33s]  I do it for a living we have people like you you make our lives hell
[21943.97s -> 21947.73s]  We have our tickets open sitting there forever because they never pick up and they never reply
[21948.37s -> 21951.41s]  You wanted our help. Why won't you return our calls you monster?
[21957.98s -> 21964.80s]  But here's the thing
[21964.80s -> 21968.08s]  I got no, I have no excuse. You're right. It's it's not nice. You're right
[21968.48s -> 21975.42s]  Uh, but I it's everybody. It's everybody. It's everyone. It's not just me
[21976.53s -> 21982.05s]  When I brought that up, I I I think 3 000 people all said that they do the same thing
[21983.60s -> 21985.84s]  So it's a it's a whole it's an us problem
[21987.23s -> 21988.88s]  You know
[21988.88s -> 21991.12s]  Until we find out a way to have
[21991.66s -> 21995.28s]  Voicemails be you know what voicemails will be gone in 10 years. Anyways, doesn't matter
[21996.99s -> 21999.87s]  You'll be able to get a text message and it'll just be read in your brain
[22000.67s -> 22002.67s]  You'll get like tts text messages
[22003.31s -> 22005.23s]  You can just turn them on
[22005.23s -> 22008.99s]  So yeah, the voicemails will won't exist in like another probably 10 20 years
[22010.48s -> 22012.48s]  So your job will get way easier
[22015.25s -> 22021.31s]  Hey, just a sad boy. Thanks for 300 bits. No message. Just
[22022.03s -> 22030.26s]  300 bits. Thank you. Uh, thank you. Emmanuel depressed. Thanks for the 500 bits
[22032.91s -> 22034.91s]  German, I know the stock trading joke is a thing
[22035.39s -> 22041.39s]  But do you still dabble in stocks and if so, what kind of stocks do you buy and any stock trading tips from the richest streamer on earth?
[22042.43s -> 22043.71s]  Okay, thanks
[22043.71s -> 22052.45s]  I'm of the opinion that you should never take trading advice from anyone because everybody's guessing
[22055.55s -> 22058.11s]  You just have to try to use your best judgment on what you think
[22058.67s -> 22062.43s]  If you're gonna just kind of play around with like a little bit of money and don't ever use
[22064.59s -> 22067.39s]  That much money when you play when you like trade
[22068.03s -> 22071.87s]  Is not don't do that. If you want to have like a little robin hood account or something where you
[22072.53s -> 22077.09s]  Mess around with like 30 40 50 bucks or something, but don't don't like all right
[22077.73s -> 22079.97s]  I guess i'll buy 10 grand worth of
[22080.77s -> 22084.24s]  Apple and then it's just it's gonna maybe it'll go up tomorrow
[22090.38s -> 22096.08s]  Uh, but if anyone ever tells you let me let me tell you something. I got so many let me tell you
[22096.08s -> 22099.76s]  I know everything about the stock market. I got this I got that I I you know, I got this chart
[22099.76s -> 22105.95s]  I've got this let me tell you that's you gotta buy this one. No, just go just eat a banana
[22106.35s -> 22114.86s]  He's talking to his past self
[22122.51s -> 22124.51s]  Banana stocks
[22125.15s -> 22129.15s]  And maybe you'll calm down
[22129.15s -> 22131.39s]  And maybe you'll get the right amount of potassium
[22133.14s -> 22135.14s]  I don't think you guys realize just how
[22136.40s -> 22138.08s]  many problems
[22138.08s -> 22139.52s]  are solvable
[22139.52s -> 22142.16s]  With a banana just by consuming a banana
[22145.09s -> 22146.69s]  That is the world's
[22146.69s -> 22163.58s]  Most versatile fruit it does everything he's saying invest in no i'm not saying to invest in but no, why would you do that?
[22166.17s -> 22167.15s]  oh
[22167.15s -> 22168.82s]  w
[22168.82s -> 22170.82s]  Oh, why did I read that?
[22172.56s -> 22174.88s]  I hate bananas. I used to too
[22175.76s -> 22178.90s]  I did
[22181.30s -> 22183.30s]  I don't know why I read that but
[22183.94s -> 22188.82s]  No, here's the one thing that you need that i've realized over the last five to ten years
[22191.73s -> 22195.04s]  you can't
[22195.04s -> 22200.80s]  You can't tell people what to do with their money like because then you almost become responsible
[22201.36s -> 22203.36s]  For if that something goes wrong
[22203.52s -> 22209.30s]  You know what I mean? Let's just say for instance and i'm gonna put a huge gigantic asterisk on here
[22211.14s -> 22214.66s]  This is a joke scenario. This is not real
[22215.30s -> 22218.52s]  And the following sentences are are fabricated
[22222.46s -> 22228.46s]  If I told you to go right now hey, yeah, yeah, I got some tips for you jack open up um
[22229.10s -> 22235.98s]  Yeah, you really should get into I mean honestly seriously like whole foods is starting to really take off amazon
[22236.06s -> 22238.46s]  Like you really probably should start to buy a little bit of the amazon stock
[22238.78s -> 22242.78s]  So, uh, once like the big whole foods earnings call happens, uh, you know go up
[22242.94s -> 22245.42s]  Maybe for probably like five ten percent sell it on the next day
[22247.07s -> 22249.65s]  If that doesn't happen
[22249.65s -> 22250.69s]  I
[22250.69s -> 22258.74s]  I've just made an enemy, you know, what if that doesn't happen?
[22260.38s -> 22265.36s]  I did that so I will never tell anybody what they should buy
[22266.54s -> 22268.08s]  investment wise
[22268.08s -> 22280.03s]  Except you know if you were talking about that bitcoin and I still wouldn't
[22290.12s -> 22292.40s]  bitcoin
[22292.40s -> 22294.40s]  Invest in vault going no. Yeah, I
[22296.05s -> 22302.61s]  But long story short, yeah, yeah, I can't I don't want to tell you what to do with your investments. Just do your research
[22303.78s -> 22305.78s]  If you think a company is worth investing in
[22306.90s -> 22312.34s]  Really look into it and see what their plans are on the future see what you what you think they're going to do
[22312.34s -> 22314.10s]  And if you think it's worth it
[22314.10s -> 22317.30s]  Don't let anybody else try to tell you that unless this person
[22318.66s -> 22323.78s]  No, you just can't you can't if you have a financial advisor then you have a stock portfolio then yeah
[22323.86s -> 22325.86s]  Then trust what that person does
[22326.34s -> 22329.78s]  Because you're it's you're that's your financial advisor
[22330.58s -> 22332.58s]  Not the guy on the subway
[22333.30s -> 22343.38s]  You understand?
[22343.38s -> 22346.11s]  anyways

[22376.98s -> 22380.98s]  But it's also bittersweet since I have to miss most streams from now on
[22381.46s -> 22383.46s]  Depending on what my work schedule will look like
[22383.78s -> 22386.26s]  Maybe they'll let me listen to them while I stack boxes
[22386.82s -> 22388.42s]  Let's cross our fingers
[22388.42s -> 22390.66s]  But in the meantime, let's go vaude gang

[22474.26s -> 22478.98s]  Where the where the fuck am I? Oh, this is another hallway. I'm in a circle. Fuck
[22481.12s -> 22484.48s]  And everybody laughs wicked hard and then I look in the camera and I go
[22485.12s -> 22486.64s]  And I wink
[22486.64s -> 22498.11s]  And then the stream turns off
[22498.11s -> 22503.14s]  And I lie in bed and I look at the ceiling
[22503.86s -> 22506.67s]  and I go how

[22512.32s -> 22513.97s]  fucking
[22513.97s -> 22515.33s]  times
[22515.33s -> 22526.42s]  And I squeeze my eyes for like to squeeze my eyes real tight to try to like block out the memory. I'm just like, yeah

[22587.73s -> 22589.73s]  That reminds me. I need to go back and watch
[22592.16s -> 22595.68s]  The old ren and stimpies they tried to bring it back and it was just a disaster
[22598.38s -> 22600.38s]  The original ren and stimpy
[22600.38s -> 22602.38s]  Is just so bizarre
[22602.62s -> 22611.01s]  and interesting
[22611.01s -> 22613.49s]  Billy west is in the chat. Holy are you serious?

[22735.74s -> 22739.50s]  That reminded me of the time. I had to drink steroids from my leg stuff was disgusting
[22740.06s -> 22743.50s]  I lost my appetite for a few days, but I couldn't get over the taste out of my mouth
[22744.30s -> 22746.38s]  Yeah, it's it's it's kind of similar
[22748.61s -> 22753.17s]  Uh, I two two two times a day morning and night. I have to drink
[22754.37s -> 22755.41s]  this
[22755.41s -> 22757.01s]  gross thick
[22757.01s -> 22759.01s]  Dick sugary liquid
[22759.55s -> 22762.16s]  It's disgusting
[22762.16s -> 22764.48s]  It is not appealing at all
[22765.52s -> 22767.12s]  it's just
[22767.12s -> 22768.64s]  the word is just
[22768.64s -> 22774.75s]  vile
[22774.75s -> 22776.32s]  and it's
[22776.32s -> 22778.32s]  Kind of just like fucking me all up
[22778.80s -> 22782.64s]  prescribed maple syrup
[22783.10s -> 22786.13s]  Yeah, weirdly
[22786.13s -> 22796.21s]  Dunkin donuts coffee, but yeah, it's it's it's annoying but
[22797.01s -> 22799.01s]  You know like you gotta do what you gotta do
[22801.18s -> 22803.34s]  Hold, you know as well drinking it that makes it worse for me
[22804.06s -> 22805.98s]  because my brain
[22805.98s -> 22807.98s]  dials up a thousand percent
[22808.46s -> 22811.18s]  You know what this tastes like you know what that tastes like, you know what that tastes like
[22811.18s -> 22814.06s]  It's disgusting. You know what that's it. You know what this tastes like and i'm just like, I know
[22814.14s -> 22816.30s]  I know what it tastes like. I know I know. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do
[22816.62s -> 22821.78s]  You know what I tell you know what it tastes like and it makes it worse
[22828.54s -> 22830.78s]  Especially because it's like it's consistency too
[22832.32s -> 22843.66s]  Uh-uh, I just have to do it get a turkey baster and shoot his tongue on your throat
[22844.38s -> 22849.90s]  No, it's two at number one. It's very thick and number two. I don't really want like gag and puke
[22853.10s -> 22855.10s]  I can't oh i've got bananas
[22855.66s -> 22859.66s]  I can't you know what i'm gonna do listen to this shit. I'm about to blow your mind right now
[22859.66s -> 22861.66s]  Let me tell you something. Let me tell you a secret
[22862.53s -> 22864.80s]  Take six bananas
[22864.80s -> 22866.80s]  Chop them up peel them make sure they're ripe
[22867.81s -> 22871.81s]  Chop them up into little you know, maybe half inch circles
[22872.69s -> 22876.05s]  Put them in the freezer a few hours later when they're frozen
[22877.07s -> 22878.27s]  Take them out
[22878.27s -> 22879.71s]  Put them into a blender
[22879.71s -> 22882.16s]  blend them up
[22882.16s -> 22884.72s]  smooth
[22884.72s -> 22886.72s]  Take them out of the blender now that they are
[22887.68s -> 22889.20s]  banana ice cream
[22889.20s -> 22890.72s]  Scoop it up
[22890.72s -> 22892.62s]  Put it into a bowl
[22892.62s -> 22898.94s]  And eat it if you want to add a little bit you maybe you know, sometimes if you want to get a little
[22899.90s -> 22903.34s]  A little fun with it. You can add like a scoop of vanilla ice cream
[22904.58s -> 22906.58s]  You could add a scoop of chocolate ice cream
[22906.90s -> 22908.90s]  You could add a
[22909.06s -> 22911.14s]  little bit of your favorite
[22912.10s -> 22915.06s]  Other like strawberries, maybe you could add like a couple of strawberries
[22915.70s -> 22923.46s]  Maybe some yogurt somebody said that sounds disgusting. It's really difficult for me not not to ban you permanently from the channel
[22924.69s -> 22928.53s]  I mean like i'm hovering and I it's i've never done that before but that's
[22930.24s -> 22933.12s]  It's close
[22933.12s -> 22939.82s]  Saved you. Okay, just make banana bread if you've never had it before
[22940.54s -> 22942.64s]  I would like you to not
[22942.64s -> 22945.26s]  Talk smack about it until you eat it
[22945.92s -> 22951.68s]  It is the most intensely delicious banana ice cream and it's not even ice cream
[22955.30s -> 22957.30s]  It's so much better for you, too
[22957.54s -> 22964.05s]  Can you repeat repeat the instructions? I wasn't listening. Well, that's unfortunate because
[22965.01s -> 22972.24s]  You should have listened to the tutorial germa. Why didn't you why didn't you know that f was open door?
[22977.60s -> 22983.30s]  Why weren't you paying attention germa?
[22983.62s -> 22985.62s]  He hates us
[22988.05s -> 22993.55s]  Okay
[22994.11s -> 22996.11s]  Let's keep going. We only got a little bit more to do
[22997.15s -> 22998.51s]  but anyways, uh
[22998.51s -> 23002.11s]  Six bananas chop chop chop chop chop make sure they're ripe freeze them
[23003.71s -> 23005.55s]  Take them out of the freezer when they're done about
[23005.55s -> 23008.83s]  Three to two to four of some with three or four hours depending on your freezer
[23008.83s -> 23012.43s]  I don't know how powerful it is. You might have like a blast chiller. I don't know that
[23013.39s -> 23015.23s]  I don't even have one of those
[23015.23s -> 23018.88s]  Don't put it in there. Uh, but if you I don't know why I even brought that up
[23019.28s -> 23023.28s]  Three or four hours in the freezer take them out put them in the blender blend it up until completely smooth
[23023.28s -> 23026.48s]  No chunky bullshit wait till it's smooth. It might take a little while
[23028.05s -> 23031.57s]  Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream if you feel like it you don't have to this is on you
[23032.05s -> 23034.85s]  Add a scoop of chocolate ice cream if you feel like it that's on you not on me
[23035.57s -> 23037.57s]  add whoa
[23038.03s -> 23040.91s]  Add two or three full tablespoon like
[23042.11s -> 23044.75s]  Of peanut butter
[23044.75s -> 23052.05s]  Blend it up. There you go. Done. I want that's that's your homework for the next day
[23053.50s -> 23055.50s]  I want all of you to have a banana
[23055.90s -> 23059.90s]  a whipped up frozen banana with maybe a little bit of peanut butter in it
[23060.72s -> 23063.44s]  or a little bit of uh, like vanilla or chocolate ice cream or just
[23064.24s -> 23067.84s]  Just straight up and I want you to come back and we want to I want to discuss this. It's your homework
[23073.14s -> 23078.90s]  Eat six. No, not you don't eat six bananas in one sitting. That's just to make enough to eat it a few times
[23082.14s -> 23085.42s]  I'm gonna make it and i'm gonna show it to you on stream and I want us all to show it
[23085.98s -> 23090.45s]  at the same time
[23090.45s -> 23091.97s]  but anyways
[23091.97s -> 23095.17s]  Uh s10w update. Thank you slow update for the 250
[23095.81s -> 23100.58s]  Hey germa back again to wish you a happy halloween. Unfortunately last stream I caught was the carnival
[23101.06s -> 23105.30s]  Which by the way is my favorite stream ever now, but I couldn't watch it because of work and stuff
[23105.62s -> 23107.70s]  But i'm happy to say i'm back to donating and supporting you
[23108.34s -> 23111.38s]  Peace and love peace and love ps. What's your favorite horror game?
[23112.02s -> 23113.46s]  Just asking
[23113.46s -> 23122.21s]  Probably outlast or resident evil 2 or the first six hours of resident evil 7
[23124.86s -> 23132.11s]  Something like that
[23132.11s -> 23134.50s]  resident evil 4
[23134.50s -> 23137.86s]  Didn't scare me as much as resident evil 2
[23138.83s -> 23148.14s]  Did especially the remake and we're talking straight up scary how what's my favorite horror like how what there's a couple of criteria there?
[23148.70s -> 23158.08s]  Yeah, resident evil is not that scary. There's a few times in resident evil the the regenerator the regenerators
[23159.50s -> 23161.74s]  Were terrifying the first few times you see them
[23164.37s -> 23166.37s]  In fact, I would put the regenerators up
[23166.85s -> 23170.77s]  As some of the scariest enemies I think i've played that were in a game
[23174.61s -> 23179.49s]  Number one the number one scariest enemy the most intensely terrifying
[23180.53s -> 23182.86s]  enemy experience
[23182.86s -> 23186.69s]  Has to be misdirected. It has to be at this point
[23189.90s -> 23193.22s]  it just was
[23193.22s -> 23195.22s]  just the stress
[23197.06s -> 23200.58s]  and the the walking around and the fact that
[23201.54s -> 23203.54s]  Because a lot of scenarios like that
[23204.19s -> 23208.59s]  It happens for a little bit and then you don't see them anymore. It doesn't happen anymore
[23210.82s -> 23216.18s]  It's a thing that happens for a 30 minute period during the course of the game
[23218.21s -> 23223.90s]  That motherfucker
[23223.90s -> 23226.58s]  does not
[23226.58s -> 23231.66s]  Leave you the fuck alone
[23231.66s -> 23234.42s]  It's horrible
[23234.42s -> 23243.62s]  It's so stressful and so scary and just design wise. He's just a really interesting designed character
[23244.02s -> 23247.30s]  I mean just like it's just a huge guy. It's just a huge guy
[23248.26s -> 23249.30s]  with a
[23249.30s -> 23253.10s]  little top hat on and an overcoat so
[23253.82s -> 23258.78s]  It's cool. But yeah
[23258.78s -> 23262.22s]  I actually think that resident evil 2 we're getting close here to the end of the year
[23263.20s -> 23265.20s]  Resident evil 2 might be the best game of the year
[23268.53s -> 23270.77s]  Yeah, I think so. It's gonna be close
[23273.87s -> 23275.87s]  Sekiro, I wouldn't put sekiro there
[23279.66s -> 23282.66s]  At least for me
[23282.66s -> 23284.96s]  I would put sekiro somewhere
[23284.96s -> 23289.89s]  Probably in the top like five
[23289.89s -> 23296.61s]  But I think uh, I think resident evil 2 is the best game i've played this year in regards to just total like the whole thing
[23302.64s -> 23303.92s]  goose game
[23303.92s -> 23307.52s]  That's funny you say that because I probably would put that somewhere in the top like five or top ten
[23310.18s -> 23311.78s]  What came out this year?
[23311.78s -> 23317.10s]  Let me think what like came out this year like actual games that released this year
[23317.82s -> 23329.71s]  Came out this year
[23329.71s -> 23332.11s]  Smash came out, but I wouldn't put that up
[23333.47s -> 23337.79s]  It was cool. It was good, but I don't kingdom hearts 3 I didn't even play it like I don't want to
[23338.67s -> 23345.28s]  Let's see
[23345.28s -> 23349.12s]  Kingdom hearts 3
[23350.86s -> 23352.86s]  Crackdown to 3
[23354.13s -> 23360.21s]  Anthem which I know metro exodus. I didn't play it devil may cry 5. I want to play it
[23364.53s -> 23366.53s]  Sekiro mortal kombat 11
[23366.85s -> 23370.11s]  Didn't play it
[23370.11s -> 23378.37s]  Control didn't play it
[23378.37s -> 23380.37s]  It's it's it's resident evil 2
[23381.09s -> 23383.09s]  And unless something else comes out, I think
[23383.65s -> 23388.06s]  What came out for nintendo?
[23389.46s -> 23398.94s]  Mario maker 2
[23398.94s -> 23400.94s]  Death stranding is coming out. Yeah
[23401.90s -> 23413.23s]  Let's see what else even really even like indie wise let me think of what I
[23414.27s -> 23416.03s]  You know what I have what I do
[23416.03s -> 23417.47s]  I have to go
[23417.47s -> 23419.31s]  Anytime that there's like an end of the year scenario
[23419.31s -> 23421.87s]  It's like what what did I actually really like at the end of the year?
[23422.27s -> 23425.55s]  I go back to my steam purchase history and go to the year
[23426.43s -> 23428.43s]  And then look at what what I played
[23434.82s -> 23437.34s]  Yeah, it's resident evil 2
[23437.34s -> 23444.88s]  at least now
[23444.88s -> 23447.23s]  big spender
[23447.23s -> 23451.33s]  No, it's that I just want to I just need to remind myself what I bought in 2019
[23454.61s -> 23460.53s]  And please do hey do do not criticize my steam spending habits all of us
[23461.79s -> 23465.71s]  Almost everybody in this channel right now is like addicted to steam
[23466.43s -> 23472.16s]  And buying steam games is everybody here. Maybe some of you don't
[23473.87s -> 23476.83s]  I've been I have like I think I have
[23477.39s -> 23480.08s]  I don't even know how many games I have i've had
[23481.09s -> 23483.17s]  I'm trying to think I maybe okay. I could look
[23485.57s -> 23488.69s]  Every steam sale that happens people just buy them
[23489.49s -> 23491.26s]  You just do
[23491.26s -> 23500.18s]  That's how it was and that's how it will be when they even now but they used to do
[23501.47s -> 23505.23s]  Five years ago. It was a big deal when a game was 75% off
[23505.79s -> 23510.78s]  Oh there. There's a bundle. Here's the entire ubisoft bundle. It's
[23511.40s -> 23513.40s]  75% off. It's normally like
[23514.44s -> 23516.74s]  165 dollars
[23516.74s -> 23522.24s]  Okay, I guess i'll own every single ubisoft game
[23524.24s -> 23529.89s]  I guess
[23529.89s -> 23533.89s]  You buy games. You don't even play them that I have not done that for very very many ago
[23540.61s -> 23545.65s]  most of the I would say almost all of the games that i've purchased they're games that i've wanted to play
[23546.29s -> 23547.97s]  and even if they weren't
[23547.97s -> 23553.49s]  They're games that I eventually did for at least enough time to understand if I really cared about it
[23558.02s -> 23560.74s]  I get bored of games like halfway through that happens to me all the time, too
[23561.22s -> 23568.30s]  You know a lot of you guys will ask like oh, how come you won't stream a game more than three four or five times
[23569.63s -> 23572.99s]  It's because that I don't really play very very many games
[23573.79s -> 23576.75s]  For more than like three four or five sessions
[23577.78s -> 23582.02s]  It's not really necessarily a stream thing like well, I don't want the view counts to drop
[23582.91s -> 23585.06s]  No, it's more of
[23585.06s -> 23589.09s]  It's I lose attention on stuff more than halfway through
[23595.74s -> 23599.10s]  That's why playing games like uh back in the day like playing tf2
[23599.58s -> 23602.86s]  And playing diablo 2 and some of these other games that I was obsessed with
[23603.92s -> 23608.24s]  It didn't matter how much time you spent you could play it for an hour or you could play it for 10
[23608.64s -> 23610.64s]  It didn't matter you're gonna play it regardless
[23616.05s -> 23618.13s]  And they had a game has not really come along
[23619.01s -> 23621.25s]  That has done that to me
[23621.81s -> 23627.01s]  Where oh i'm just gonna turn it on for like two hours and that's I just that's what I want to do today
[23627.65s -> 23638.24s]  That's not really happening. And I think that one of the reasons why is because a lot of that
[23639.04s -> 23642.64s]  Has a lot of those markets have kind of turned into
[23644.42s -> 23648.34s]  Like br markets like a lot like fortnite apex and I just don't
[23649.57s -> 23653.01s]  I don't really care about those games. They don't do it for me at all
[23664.10s -> 23669.78s]  I can understand why br is an interesting experience. I just cannot stomach it. I just can't do it
[23672.74s -> 23675.14s]  German won't even give a no to stalker
[23676.70s -> 23678.70s]  What is with the stalker thing?
[23682.16s -> 23685.44s]  I played like I played stalker what a call of prep yet
[23685.44s -> 23688.88s]  I played it for like a stream or two and then I like it was like three years ago
[23692.51s -> 23694.99s]  God damn it. Like is he ever gonna finish stalker?
[23696.08s -> 23699.04s]  We haven't seen a stalker episode in three years
[23701.30s -> 23703.38s]  It's been a long time. That's even that's back
[23704.02s -> 23706.26s]  Like I've been I was living in massachusetts still
[23711.42s -> 23713.58s]  He's not gonna play tony hawks pro skater
[23714.14s -> 23718.86s]  Yeah, but that's just kind of how I play games anyways, too
[23719.66s -> 23725.34s]  I'll get it when I play a game
[23726.06s -> 23732.03s]  This is how you guys know that I actually like something like really like a game
[23733.55s -> 23734.74s]  Really?
[23734.74s -> 23737.38s]  I oh that was kind of fun. Oh, this is kind of interesting
[23737.94s -> 23741.78s]  No, no, no, like truly enjoy and fully appreciate a video game
[23743.81s -> 23751.42s]  If I want to finish it on stream because that means I really just want to play it
[23752.22s -> 23753.89s]  and
[23753.89s -> 23757.57s]  I want to I have I live stream don't I?
[23765.14s -> 23767.14s]  lifeline clock tower three
[23768.53s -> 23771.73s]  Yeah, all right. Hold on. There's a couple of variables here though
[23773.39s -> 23775.55s]  Sometimes you just have to get to the end
[23776.11s -> 23783.17s]  Because you have to
[23783.17s -> 23788.80s]  There's no other reason I was not going to see
[23790.08s -> 23793.60s]  After the first six seven eight hours of clock tower three
[23795.70s -> 23797.70s]  I was not going to turn that stream off
[23799.12s -> 23806.50s]  And then turn on clock tower three again. I knew it so we had to see it through that night
[23806.90s -> 23814.38s]  He's playing it out of obligation
[23814.86s -> 23817.90s]  Well obligation to knee I want needing to see
[23818.62s -> 23822.78s]  How it ends because I know that I will not go back to it. It'll come out of the playstation 2
[23823.34s -> 23827.42s]  It'll go in a box and then it'll turn into one of those scenarios where oh, yeah, I guess um
[23828.14s -> 23831.66s]  Yeah, I did finish clock tower three and sometimes maybe sometime. I don't know
[23832.46s -> 23834.91s]  I'm gonna clock tower three and uh find a way
[23835.63s -> 23837.79s]  You know scary monsters and try to get away from it
[23840.46s -> 23842.46s]  I mean, maybe maybe one day
[23843.41s -> 23848.21s]  Get scared of them. Maybe
[23848.21s -> 23855.58s]  No, I i'm not gonna go back to it. So I had to do you have to do it sometimes but
[23856.77s -> 23858.29s]  Let's finish the bits
[23858.29s -> 23861.41s]  We're getting we're getting into some tangents here that
[23862.13s -> 23867.09s]  I love getting I love getting on tangents. I do
[23867.65s -> 23869.33s]  It's like one of my favorite things
[23869.33s -> 23874.45s]  You just got your andy marco in the mail
[23874.85s -> 23876.85s]  And you're watching the stream
[23876.93s -> 23879.01s]  With the andy marco. Oh, fuck. Yeah
[23880.22s -> 23884.50s]  Hell, yeah, they're very cute. They're very great
[23885.06s -> 23886.82s]  That company is amazing
[23886.82s -> 23889.76s]  If you guys ever have
[23889.76s -> 23891.76s]  anything that you need
[23891.84s -> 23894.21s]  For anything to do with robotics

[23914.59s -> 23916.59s]  That helped produce the carnival stream
[23916.91s -> 23918.59s]  They made the robots
[23918.59s -> 23930.29s]  They're awesome read bits, please. I'm i'm doing it. I'm doing it. Look you guys what you gotta go to bed
[23931.01s -> 23944.16s]  Wait, you gotta go to sleep
[23944.16s -> 23950.06s]  Imagine sleeping
[23950.06s -> 23952.06s]  Sleepy chat. It's late

[23963.04s -> 23965.04s]  s l omega l

[23978.82s -> 23986.88s]  I plan to I plan to read the bits. My mom is screaming
[23987.76s -> 23992.19s]  Well, then you probably you probably should get off the computer
[23993.81s -> 23995.81s]  And go find out what that's about
[24000.40s -> 24002.24s]  Lovely carver. Thanks for the
[24002.24s -> 24005.22s]  2500 bits
[24005.22s -> 24011.92s]  25 dollars. Thank you. Hey germa been watching you for about six years or so. I just recently took a big exam
[24012.72s -> 24014.88s]  Think uh, like cpa exams
[24016.74s -> 24019.78s]  And in the middle of the testing area, which is dead silent
[24019.86s -> 24025.30s]  I started thinking of the greedy grinner and your no emotion bit and burst into laughter
[24026.18s -> 24028.74s]  They kicked me out and I failed the exam
[24029.46s -> 24035.57s]  No, they say unsubscribed that's not good
[24041.22s -> 24045.30s]  That kind of reminds me that reminds me of a story
[24046.37s -> 24051.57s]  That reminds me of a nice long winded story that i'm gonna go on up on here
[24054.06s -> 24060.34s]  One time I took a picture. No, no, just listen to me one time. I took a picture
[24061.79s -> 24065.79s]  Of my friend. We were he was in the back seat. We were on a road trip
[24066.83s -> 24069.71s]  And he was sleeping
[24069.71s -> 24073.07s]  and I just took a picture of his sleeping face because
[24073.63s -> 24075.63s]  He was snoring really loudly
[24076.51s -> 24082.54s]  and it was like, oh my god, why is he sleeping so loudly and
[24083.95s -> 24086.43s]  I just took he was just like his mouth
[24087.78s -> 24089.78s]  His mouth was just open
[24090.02s -> 24094.26s]  and his like eyes it looked just like insane so
[24096.46s -> 24100.64s]  Eventually, he he woke up and we looked he was I was like look at how he was sleeping
[24100.64s -> 24102.64s]  He was like, oh shit like what the fuck
[24103.90s -> 24111.07s]  And seriously for the next week for the next week. I was at the grocery store
[24112.16s -> 24113.52s]  I was
[24113.52s -> 24115.12s]  Driving around
[24115.12s -> 24118.40s]  And I would just see the image of him his face
[24119.12s -> 24123.36s]  And I would start laughing hysterically. I remember being at the checkout at a grocery store
[24124.16s -> 24125.90s]  and just
[24125.90s -> 24133.84s]  Do decide there's there's no reason for me to think about this image and this is absolutely absolutely like seven or eight days later
[24134.00s -> 24136.38s]  Had to be
[24136.38s -> 24138.38s]  and started laughing
[24139.39s -> 24142.54s]  uncontrollably in the checkout and just kept going
[24144.14s -> 24147.74s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just i'm definitely really funny happened
[24149.12s -> 24153.36s]  And I remember the lady just being like, yeah, she was kind of laughing too
[24155.10s -> 24158.70s]  But this photo I don't I don't have it anymore, but it's
[24159.34s -> 24166.00s]  It's fucking funny
[24166.00s -> 24168.00s]  Patrick Bateman what?
[24173.26s -> 24176.14s]  No, not it wasn't she was like she thought she thought it was funny
[24176.46s -> 24180.14s]  I wasn't guys. I wasn't being like a fucking weirdo. I wasn't like
[24183.50s -> 24190.14s]  No, I was just laughing going i'm sorry that something really funny happened and i'm just trying to just trying to get through it
[24190.14s -> 24192.38s]  You know, it's sometimes it pops in your head. She's like
[24193.82s -> 24198.18s]  It's contagious. This is funny
[24198.18s -> 24200.90s]  Actually crazy. No, it's it was funny
[24206.24s -> 24211.76s]  Her friends told no her friends told her told me she told her friends later that there was a serial killer in the store
[24211.92s -> 24213.92s]  No, that's not what happened
[24222.06s -> 24223.50s]  Okay

[24254.74s -> 24257.78s]  I can't look at chat right now you guys being too funny. Okay
[24259.33s -> 24263.09s]  Uh, hey germa, it's the animal rescue guy who used to stream the ducks
[24264.32s -> 24266.32s]  Until his computer broke
[24266.56s -> 24270.40s]  Just want to say i've gotten so many nice messages from your community even after the computer broke
[24271.12s -> 24273.84s]  Oh also, remember you chose a duckling and named it bilbo
[24274.48s -> 24277.28s]  Well, that ducks the tamest duck out of the hundreds
[24277.92s -> 24280.96s]  He follows any person through the yard and loves to cuddle
[24281.52s -> 24283.12s]  Here's a real
[24283.12s -> 24284.16s]  real
[24284.24s -> 24292.27s]  Short bit of him if you want to see thanks for all you do that isn't that just fucking adorable
[24293.09s -> 24294.13s]  Let's see
[24294.13s -> 24304.16s]  Let's take a look. How can I it's on instagram. So this is what happens
[24305.04s -> 24312.53s]  Can I pull this right now into here? Come on

[24324.72s -> 24328.32s]  Uh, I should be able to get it
[24329.47s -> 24332.59s]  Let's go like this and we can actually go over to here now
[24342.78s -> 24356.88s]  Why none of these working why is this playing was this the last thing that I put on my browser source
[24357.84s -> 24362.70s]  It has to be
[24379.04s -> 24381.04s]  Oh, I gotta get an update I have an update
[24382.00s -> 24392.03s]  Uh, all right, let's watch this video
[24393.47s -> 24396.61s]  This one there it is
[24404.19s -> 24418.32s]  Not that one this one this one these are apparently this is the ducks
[24420.99s -> 24423.87s]  So this is what happens every time I walk through the yard
[24430.38s -> 24438.66s]  There it is
[24438.66s -> 24440.72s]  It's me
[24440.72s -> 24442.90s]  Hello
[24444.02s -> 24446.88s]  Why are you not paying attention to me what are you doing bilbo?
[24452.72s -> 24457.86s]  That's so cute
[24457.86s -> 24460.99s]  Bilbo, that's awesome
[24461.81s -> 24463.81s]  Thank you for sharing that that was great
[24464.80s -> 24469.36s]  And that's the that's the duck that I named it out of all the ducks out of the hundreds of ducks
[24471.39s -> 24476.03s]  That's the best one. This is what you said. That's the the most well-behaved the most lovable the most interesting
[24478.70s -> 24480.70s]  That's pretty good pick. I think
[24480.78s -> 24482.62s]  of millions of ducks
[24482.62s -> 24495.36s]  Keep telling yourself that hey, I don't have to tell myself that somebody else told me that I don't have to tell myself that
[24496.78s -> 24512.63s]  But I will continue to do that in the mirror later on this evening, but thank you though. Seriously. That was uh, anonilous
[24516.08s -> 24521.01s]  Bring back the duck stream
[24521.01s -> 24527.02s]  Hey potato chief. Thanks for the 700 bits derma. Just turned 26 today. Here's your cut of the birthday money. Happy birthday
[24527.50s -> 24529.74s]  It's hard to imagine. You're almost 30 years older than me
[24532.18s -> 24537.38s]  Anyways, love the streams and I hope you're feeling better soon. Okay for a second. I thought you were four
[24537.86s -> 24542.91s]  That's like that's that's very advanced

[24621.47s -> 24625.20s]  But is there a set date for the next green screen stream? No
[24626.66s -> 24629.22s]  There's not going to be a set date for it until I start to pull
[24630.00s -> 24631.20s]  um
[24631.20s -> 24635.70s]  Suggestions in a new discord channel and that will happen after halloween
[24639.31s -> 24643.63s]  So after halloween because we already have two channels open right now that people are doing stuff in so
[24645.28s -> 24652.00s]  At some point after halloween, you'll see that channel pop up and that stream is going to happen in november. So
[24652.48s -> 24655.61s]  It'll probably be early
[24655.61s -> 24661.64s]  One of the first or second weeks of november, I would assume but thank you so much
[24662.78s -> 24665.26s]  See 4g. Thanks for the 250 rhythm games means

[24708.01s -> 24713.18s]  Hey jerma, thanks for playing fear. It's one of my favorite games and you butchered it to near perfection
[24714.83s -> 24717.47s]  I did. All right. I got I walked in a alright. Hold on
[24718.54s -> 24721.34s]  I've walked in a circle like a few times
[24722.32s -> 24725.96s]  And that was it. I did. All right. I did. I did. All right
[24726.60s -> 24734.38s]  It was fun. I didn't come on. Come on. I did fine. I did
[24734.86s -> 24743.12s]  Fun, would you consider getting a perm so you'd be curly? No curly didn't have hair. That's not even what you said
[24744.86s -> 24748.38s]  Uh, thank you. You need there's no bits here. You just wrote that in chat. Thank you
[24752.19s -> 24758.84s]  Why would you read a perm comment, I don't know but no I uh
[24760.72s -> 24765.31s]  It was great. I can see why it's a lot of people's favorite games from
[24766.49s -> 24768.28s]  a while back
[24768.28s -> 24772.52s]  Hey, I it probably would be one of mine too if I played it 10 15 years ago
[24773.66s -> 24776.38s]  I hope your stomach gets an order and your energy can be restored
[24776.94s -> 24783.34s]  So we can get more chunky delicious 15 hour play the whole game. Not a joke clock tower three type streams
[24785.42s -> 24789.63s]  Tell stir to get well soon, too
[24789.63s -> 24791.21s]  Thank you
[24791.21s -> 24792.92s]  um
[24792.92s -> 24796.92s]  I mean dark wood the last dark wood stream was almost 12 hours
[24798.75s -> 24816.11s]  I started to lose my fucking mind at the end of that one doing more this
[24817.07s -> 24824.19s]  Doing more than 12 15 hour streams. I they they they kill me. I can't do them
[24826.57s -> 24828.57s]  I can't
[24828.57s -> 24830.57s]  Sometimes you can do
[24830.89s -> 24832.89s]  I don't know how people do it. I really don't
[24835.63s -> 24839.63s]  Trap joke grenade joke fall joke dying joke pretending joke
[24843.58s -> 24846.70s]  Uh, why is why do people think that I'm pretending?
[24850.01s -> 24855.37s]  I'm for days pretending like, you know how difficult it would be to pretend to do all that shit
[24856.17s -> 24861.02s]  It would take like three times the amount of work
[24861.58s -> 24864.14s]  to pretend
[24864.20s -> 24866.20s]  Pretending not to pretend
[24866.22s -> 24875.26s]  Can you imagine setting up elaborate ways for you to step in like bear traps and that's what you're doing
[24877.95s -> 24879.95s]  imagine like falling off a cliff like
[24880.59s -> 24882.99s]  And pretending to do that more than like five times
[24883.71s -> 24895.52s]  Can you imagine lul? Yeah, this is phil jokes. No
[24896.78s -> 24901.12s]  No, it's it's called not paying attention to my surroundings
[24904.06s -> 24906.43s]  I should I should get
[24906.51s -> 24917.10s]  like my old guidance counselor from like the fucking ninth grade on the phone and ask them a few questions
[24926.91s -> 24928.91s]  Do you think it would be odd if I were to?
[24929.63s -> 24931.63s]  Put down something and then forget I put it down
[24933.36s -> 24939.74s]  No, no, in fact, uh, we had to give you a pen every day because you would bring a pen to school
[24941.18s -> 24943.18s]  And you would not leave the
[24943.18s -> 24945.18s]  You would not leave school with a with a pen
[24947.40s -> 24950.78s]  I've lost books before guys. I've lost textbooks
[24951.40s -> 24961.85s]  Teachers would give me stuff and I just wouldn't it would never come back. Oh, yeah
[24961.85s -> 24964.81s]  I'm gonna get along. I'm gonna loan you this pen. I want this one back. Okay
[24965.61s -> 24970.80s]  I don't have it. Where'd it go? I don't know
[24972.12s -> 24975.08s]  Where where is the pen? I don't know
[24976.06s -> 24979.10s]  I don't have
[24979.10s -> 24984.11s]  Okay. Well, here's another one. Don't lose this one
[24984.75s -> 24995.34s]  Thanks. I don't have it anymore. I just handed you the pen. I don't know. I just gave it to you
[24996.35s -> 24999.84s]  Did you eat it?
[24999.84s -> 25006.43s]  Maybe and then I like smile
[25006.91s -> 25008.91s]  And I got a bunch of like wood in my teeth
[25011.00s -> 25012.68s]  And then we got to commercial
[25012.68s -> 25014.68s]  Oh, well, that would be a funny show
[25014.76s -> 25016.86s]  if you call like
[25016.86s -> 25030.24s]  Jerma just doesn't get it
[25030.24s -> 25032.24s]  Everybody hates jerma
[25035.23s -> 25037.13s]  bad pilot
[25037.13s -> 25044.73s]  Bad pilot he said did you say bad pilot? Did you guys know that young sheldon exists as a television show?
[25050.59s -> 25052.67s]  That makes 500 fucking million dollars
[25064.51s -> 25067.31s]  Wait, wait, wait a minute. It's not it's not about making a good show
[25072.44s -> 25074.44s]  It would be about making as much money
[25075.32s -> 25084.80s]  as possible
[25084.88s -> 25087.84s]  Yeah, you should see you should see the huge
[25088.40s -> 25099.53s]  Grin I got right now. Did he just call out big bang theory?
[25102.11s -> 25105.76s]  No, no, I called out
[25106.43s -> 25124.30s]  Almost all network television at the same time cut his mic. How original
[25124.86s -> 25130.51s]  Jerma is big bang tier comedy
[25132.68s -> 25137.56s]  Here's the difference though. Uh, I don't I don't pump in audience members
[25141.93s -> 25143.93s]  Okay, if you want to go that far
[25144.78s -> 25149.02s]  That means that you that means that you've left at the big bang theory then
[25150.01s -> 25152.81s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, we can't have that. We can't have that
[25156.30s -> 25169.20s]  Oh, oh
[25169.20s -> 25172.60s]  Big bang theory sucks. You know, actually
[25173.40s -> 25175.40s]  An old college professor told me one time
[25176.04s -> 25178.28s]  That saying that something sucks
[25178.28s -> 25179.00s]  is
[25179.00s -> 25181.00s]  You can't ever say something sucks
[25183.08s -> 25185.08s]  If it if it makes
[25185.56s -> 25187.40s]  that much money
[25187.40s -> 25189.40s]  Because that means that more people
[25190.12s -> 25192.64s]  Think it does not
[25192.64s -> 25194.64s]  But then think it does
[25196.97s -> 25198.97s]  Your professor sucks
[25198.97s -> 25203.58s]  Yeah
[25210.86s -> 25214.38s]  Popularity does not equal quality. No, it doesn't but uh, but I mean
[25216.83s -> 25218.83s]  Yeah, now that I think about it that guy
[25219.85s -> 25223.93s]  Yeah, that guy that guy was only my professor for like six months and he had replaced
[25226.44s -> 25236.70s]  shit
[25236.70s -> 25239.58s]  I'm kidding. All right. All right. No, i'm not i'm not fucking around
[25241.52s -> 25244.88s]  I love fucking around but we've got a job to do
[25254.68s -> 25256.92s]  Play fear 2 right now. Why would I do that?
[25257.93s -> 25259.93s]  All right, that's it. Let's get the credits on
[25261.58s -> 25263.58s]  I'll see you guys on uh
[25265.44s -> 25267.82s]  saturday

[25276.57s -> 25279.04s]  The stream gets a lot of it. So thank you. Seriously
[25280.46s -> 25282.94s]  We fuck around a lot. I talk a lot of
[25283.48s -> 25285.48s]  bullshit all the time
[25285.90s -> 25286.86s]  but
[25286.86s -> 25290.12s]  real real real
[25290.12s -> 25292.68s]  Thank you for continuing to
[25293.87s -> 25295.87s]  Uh, let me live this fucking life
[25296.11s -> 25299.50s]  Each and every one of you. Thank you so much. Seriously
[25299.82s -> 25310.25s]  It means a lot, but while we see that we still have a handful of bits to do
[25312.24s -> 25318.64s]  We had creamy sensation gave 500 bits planning to do anything on halloween. Hope we get to see a lot of monka s moments
[25319.58s -> 25321.82s]  Yes, there's going to be an elaborate halloween stream
[25322.88s -> 25326.04s]  uh
[25326.04s -> 25328.04s]  Probably on halloween day, I would assume
[25328.99s -> 25330.99s]  They will be a halloween stream. Yes
[25331.31s -> 25333.15s]  It's gonna be a lot going on there
[25333.15s -> 25335.55s]  It's gonna be a secret slime action part of that stream
[25335.87s -> 25340.35s]  Go check out the discord go to the secret slime discussion stream so you can see exactly what is going to happen there
[25342.92s -> 25348.27s]  Should be fun, but thank you for the 500 bits. Thank you grump clump for the 300 bits grump clump
[25348.91s -> 25350.83s]  One of my mods
[25350.83s -> 25353.15s]  Can you tell my friend he did a great job on his video?
[25355.15s -> 25356.19s]  Teehee
[25356.19s -> 25358.17s]  Thanks
[25358.17s -> 25360.08s]  That video was
[25360.08s -> 25361.44s]  incredible
[25361.44s -> 25366.92s]  Oh, they forgot to link it. Oh
[25376.83s -> 25378.73s]  He just lied
[25378.73s -> 25380.73s]  Well, I didn't say it just
[25383.31s -> 25386.67s]  The message just said hey, can you say that he did a good job on this video?
[25387.92s -> 25395.98s]  Sure, I what video I was like, all right, you did a great job on this video was great

[25484.28s -> 25486.28s]  Stream will be popping soon
[25501.53s -> 25505.05s]  Did I lie about that video or was it as a great video? So
[25505.77s -> 25508.80s]  What are you guys talking about?
[25508.80s -> 25521.00s]  What do you mean? I'm not watching the frog compilation. No, everyone was just yelling at me to go to bed
[25521.98s -> 25523.98s]  And hey hurry up and finish the bits
[25526.14s -> 25528.14s]  But let's watch a frog compilation
[25537.08s -> 25540.24s]  Why not? Thank you grump clump. Thanks for the 300 bits
[25541.18s -> 25544.14s]  Slow update. Thanks for the 250. Hey jerma just quick update on my last donation
[25544.14s -> 25549.34s]  I was going to donate a lot more until I saw jerma sour and now i'm not only i'm not donating
[25549.66s -> 25551.98s]  But i'm suing for emotional damages
[25553.15s -> 25558.40s]  Uh happy to watch you again. See you next time. You know why that emotes there, right?
[25559.71s -> 25565.23s]  Because I said out loud if that emote was not there within 24 hours, I would do a 24 hour stream
[25565.63s -> 25569.39s]  That emote is only there so I would not have to do a 24 hour stream
[25575.71s -> 25578.91s]  Came pretty close. Yeah, it was about an hour and a half before the stream started that it was there
[25581.85s -> 25585.77s]  Smelly boy. Thanks for the 250. Hi jerma been loving your content so far this spooky season
[25585.77s -> 25591.77s]  My question is you ever been in the shower looked up towards the nozzle and just let a bunch of water fill your mouth for no
[25591.85s -> 25599.32s]  Reason and spit it out all the time. Yeah
[25599.80s -> 25607.12s]  I mean that that happens at least two or three times
[25607.84s -> 25611.90s]  I was gonna say a stream that happens two or three times a shower without a doubt
[25616.40s -> 25620.56s]  And my favorite part is you know, you do that and then you piss in the shower. That's like the best part
[25623.23s -> 25628.49s]  Thanks for the 250
[25628.49s -> 25629.93s]  Thank you water

[25674.94s -> 25675.98s]  that
[25675.98s -> 25677.42s]  peeing in the shower
[25677.42s -> 25679.74s]  Is one of those weird things that everybody says
[25680.22s -> 25687.42s]  It talks shit about and says that's ridiculous unbelievable what the fucking god disgusting what a psycho
[25688.14s -> 25690.14s]  And you do it every single day
[25690.62s -> 25692.86s]  I don't know why people are like this
[25694.24s -> 25696.24s]  Is there a reason why people?
[25696.38s -> 25697.69s]  pretend
[25697.69s -> 25701.13s]  that they do not pee in the shower is it's one of those things that people just
[25704.81s -> 25711.77s]  You're disgusting. You're gross and then you're like groggy in the morning and you just look down and you're just like pee into the drain
[25712.68s -> 25734.27s]  Nobody knows I did that but me it's just pipes. What's the difference? What do you mean? How does it smell?
[25735.84s -> 25737.68s]  You don't look
[25737.68s -> 25742.11s]  You don't you don't pee into a hot shower
[25743.61s -> 25745.61s]  You open up the door
[25746.81s -> 25748.81s]  You turn the shower on
[25749.15s -> 25751.39s]  And you pee into the shower
[25763.32s -> 25769.07s]  Okay, my stomach hurts there's a perfectly good toilet right behind you
[25770.03s -> 25774.51s]  But you don't give a shit for some reason
[25787.42s -> 25790.11s]  Oh
[25790.11s -> 25792.11s]  No, i'm fucking kidding, but i'm just
[25793.50s -> 25795.42s]  I'm seeing it in my head
[25795.42s -> 25798.62s]  I'm watching the thing i'm saying that i'm conveying is real
[25799.10s -> 25803.18s]  And i'm imagining what you're seeing in your head and it's making me laugh fucking hard
[25804.17s -> 25806.81s]  Because the second I start talking about it, you just people just start
[25807.61s -> 25809.29s]  It's it's I
[25809.29s -> 25814.67s]  What if i'm kidding no, I
[25815.47s -> 25824.04s]  No, I do not pee into the shower from outside the shower. I do it while i'm in there like a normal person
[25834.01s -> 25838.17s]  Define in like i'm talking in you're standing in. All right, we're not gonna even go over this
[25838.65s -> 25844.89s]  Everybody does this shit and everybody pretends like they don't do it and the and like the and like the three of you that actually
[25844.89s -> 25848.30s]  Don't do this
[25848.30s -> 25864.28s]  Good work because you're you're amongst a sea of liars right now. What about the sink? No, no, no, excuse me
[25865.84s -> 25875.88s]  There are lines you didn't know absolutely not why do people pretend that they don't take their shirts off to poo
[25876.20s -> 25894.91s]  That's another mystery. Do you guys okay? No, we're not gonna go here
[25894.91s -> 25900.43s]  But just know that for the longest time I was I used to actually I still kind of do it sometimes
[25901.15s -> 25906.38s]  I completely naked to take a shit like i'm talking not even socks
[25915.23s -> 25917.95s]  You know how difficult it is to go to the bathroom in a public bathroom
[25919.32s -> 25923.32s]  When you have to take off every single article of clothing including your shoes and socks
[25924.76s -> 25944.75s]  It's impossible
[25944.75s -> 25948.59s]  I'm saying I i've never done that. That's too hard
[25950.35s -> 25966.16s]  Uh, what the fuck is happening? Why is the credits?
[25969.42s -> 25970.75s]  Okay
[25970.75s -> 25973.56s]  uh
[25973.56s -> 25977.72s]  Can you imagine walking into like a public bathroom and you go into like wash your hands?
[25978.04s -> 25982.04s]  And you see like draped over the top of the stall like a shirt
[25982.60s -> 25987.00s]  Pants underwear socks and the shit and the guy's shoes are out in front of the stall
[25990.00s -> 25992.00s]  What the fuck is going on in here
[26010.17s -> 26016.03s]  God, all right. Let's get out of here. Thanks everybody
[26017.02s -> 26019.02s]  Oh fuck. I closed the website
[26019.92s -> 26022.64s]  I closed the website because do people still call them websites?
[26023.28s -> 26027.82s]  But you just say like I closed my tab or my site. Do you say website still?
[26034.38s -> 26035.82s]  There's no cool
[26035.82s -> 26038.60s]  New way to say that
[26038.60s -> 26043.45s]  Window. Yeah, there you go. You close the window. You don't close the website. You close the window
[26050.24s -> 26056.62s]  All right, let's finish this
[26056.62s -> 26058.57s]  Thanks for sticking around
[26058.57s -> 26060.65s]  We have
[26060.65s -> 26066.06s]  Uh, just a couple more to do. Thank you. Havegun for the 250. Hey germa
[26066.06s -> 26069.74s]  If you ever if you enjoyed sphere you might want to give a shogo
[26070.70s -> 26075.42s]  Mobile armor division a look. It's pretty fun 90s shooter by monolith monolith made a lot of great games
[26075.90s -> 26084.73s]  I wonder what they're doing now after shadow war. Thank you. Vilemi for the
[26085.83s -> 26093.24s]  2000 bits. Thank you 20 bucks here total. I'm not addicted to buying games. I'm just addicted to giving germa bits
[26095.69s -> 26097.29s]  You don't have to do that
[26097.29s -> 26104.46s]  But thank you regardless and then they say at this point we really need the germa psycho emote fine
[26110.48s -> 26114.00s]  I don't know the germa psycho emote has has to be that image
[26116.28s -> 26118.28s]  On something. I don't know. I have to find one
[26121.12s -> 26123.12s]  Which face is it going to be? I don't know
[26125.26s -> 26127.74s]  If it's not ready by saturday we get no i'm not doing that again
[26128.99s -> 26132.11s]  But it'll probably be there on saturday, but i'm not giving up. No i'm not doing that
[26132.67s -> 26135.55s]  I could not do a 24-hour stream right now, even if I lost that bet
[26136.11s -> 26138.57s]  I'm too screwed up right now
[26138.57s -> 26141.69s]  On this medication, so i'm actually surprised i'm able to be here for this long
[26143.88s -> 26146.44s]  It's actually because I i've been eating very light today
[26146.92s -> 26152.51s]  That's probably why so this stream was really not supposed to be more than like four or five hours long
[26153.13s -> 26156.67s]  But i've been okay. I felt alright, so i'm cool to hang out
[26160.03s -> 26162.76s]  But they will be one soon
[26162.84s -> 26167.00s]  Finally stefunky chicken. Thanks for the 400 bits. Did you get my other bit message?
[26167.00s -> 26173.32s]  If not, I just said the thing was a tricky game where if you don't manage it correctly, you can soft lock yourself
[26174.14s -> 26179.28s]  It's fun when you know what you're doing, uh plan on two or three save files where
[26179.92s -> 26185.72s]  Two of them get soft locked. I would assume this is the one right here. Let's see
[26190.09s -> 26192.09s]  Yeah, i'll find one some of these are good
[26198.49s -> 26201.87s]  I'll get a good one. I'll get a i'll get a damn good one
[26208.70s -> 26211.90s]  Wait, no now it sounds like I don't think kim is funny
[26213.26s -> 26215.04s]  I like this one
[26215.04s -> 26219.23s]  It'll probably be this one
[26219.23s -> 26222.51s]  Yeah, but that's not this is not even germa psycho
[26223.61s -> 26225.61s]  Look, that's not germa psycho
[26226.35s -> 26228.99s]  That's fucking that's like germa deranged
[26230.03s -> 26247.88s]  That's germa scary. That's not the same thing. I'll find one
[26252.49s -> 26254.57s]  Use the deep fake we'll see
[26260.52s -> 26263.10s]  But that is gonna be it. I'll see you guys later
[26267.63s -> 26270.70s]  Have a fantastic
[26270.78s -> 26272.78s]  Next day. I'll see you guys
[26272.86s -> 26280.51s]  Very soon. What do you mean? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[26281.31s -> 26282.67s]  What are you waiting for?
[26282.67s -> 26290.67s]  What's the matter? What are we waiting for?
[26296.16s -> 26298.60s]  Okay, you can go. Oh, thanks
[26298.60s -> 26301.00s]  What did kim what's the first thing kim said to me?
[26303.71s -> 26305.42s]  um
[26305.42s -> 26311.00s]  I don't know like
[26311.00s -> 26311.96s]  uh
[26311.96s -> 26314.43s]  She said I was a she said I was a c minus
[26327.13s -> 26330.65s]  Yeah, I remember I was like, oh what would what would you give me for like that? That's not the first thing though. That's like
[26331.84s -> 26333.20s]  and after like a
[26333.20s -> 26337.13s]  maybe like five days four or five days of uh
[26338.43s -> 26341.39s]  Of like hanging out. I was like, what would you give me for like a letter grade?
[26341.95s -> 26346.19s]  And i'm like I I would give you an a like I give you an a
[26346.75s -> 26352.52s]  She's like you get a c minus
[26352.52s -> 26356.92s]  And then wait, whoa, whoa, whoa this story. There's a small little hold on interestingly enough
[26358.11s -> 26360.43s]  After another I mean it was a joke
[26360.43s -> 26363.95s]  It was she was making a joke and I laughed at it because she knows that I think the things are funny
[26364.59s -> 26366.11s]  You know, we laughed
[26366.11s -> 26371.71s]  And then a few weeks later. I asked again. Hey, what was what was that? What that did I increase?
[26371.71s -> 26373.71s]  Mike would my was still beta c minus
[26373.87s -> 26375.87s]  Nope, I went up to a b plus
[26378.48s -> 26381.10s]  and now
[26381.10s -> 26382.94s]  What is it now?
[26382.94s -> 26389.40s]  Kim's here now kim's in the chat. What does it know? I mean like it's it's been three. It's been like almost three years
[26389.40s -> 26403.36s]  What does it know?
[26408.94s -> 26417.05s]  What no
[26417.05s -> 26419.87s]  Come on, you're supposed to say
[26419.87s -> 26423.39s]  You get an a
[26423.39s -> 26425.39s]  You get an a plus
[26426.51s -> 26428.51s]  And then everybody goes oh
[26430.06s -> 26434.22s]  And I go, oh
[26434.30s -> 26442.48s]  I just got dunked on a b a b plus is great
[26443.28s -> 26445.28s]  That means solid
[26445.52s -> 26448.27s]  very good
[26448.27s -> 26454.35s]  Not too good where you're like trying too hard, you know, like a b plus is perfect
[26454.43s -> 26456.43s]  I think b plus is the best grade you could possibly get
[26463.80s -> 26477.24s]  It'd be an a if you weren't bald
[26479.45s -> 26482.30s]  Oh my god
[26482.30s -> 26485.82s]  There's context for what kim just said. Okay, she
[26487.63s -> 26494.11s]  I don't okay. Listen, I gotta I have to I gotta explain this one because I can't leave after that
[26494.19s -> 26500.75s]  Like a bombshell like that one. I don't have any tattoos kim has a lot so
[26503.15s -> 26513.69s]  She was referring to I don't have any tattoos. I want you to get a tattoo and uh, no that's not gonna happen
[26514.01s -> 26519.87s]  The only tattoo I'd ever get would be the fucking venom symbol on my shoulder. I almost got that tattoo by the way
[26520.81s -> 26526.25s]  I was potentially hours from getting the venom symbol across my entire left shoulder
[26526.33s -> 26538.68s]  Thank god, I didn't do that because now i'm gonna get it on my chest where it belongs
[26543.39s -> 26545.95s]  Hey anonymous skifter. Thanks for the five community subs
[26546.43s -> 26562.76s]  Appreciate that and that's it. I will see you guys on saturday. It's over. It is over

[26600.35s -> 26609.50s]  Where is it? Where is it? This should have everything
[26614.14s -> 26616.86s]  So, oh, yeah, so yeah, you it was right at the beginning
[26618.57s -> 26620.57s]  So I I saw kore was here
[26621.52s -> 26625.36s]  I wonder why that didn't get picked up because kore's is the first one
[26627.53s -> 26629.37s]  Well, i'm sorry about that
[26629.37s -> 26630.96s]  uh, I

[26664.83s -> 26669.76s]  My birthday was last saturday and I missed your stream, but I wanted to say my girlfriend got me a super cool gift
[26670.16s -> 26675.31s]  She printed all your twitch emotes as stickers and they're so cool. That's awesome
[26675.55s -> 26681.96s]  My favorites are germa boomer and germa chomp. Thanks for all the entertainment. That's lovely

[26734.08s -> 26735.84s]  a good
[26735.84s -> 26738.80s]  Two plus days to have it really get into your system apparently
[26739.68s -> 26741.68s]  So, I don't know. We'll find out
