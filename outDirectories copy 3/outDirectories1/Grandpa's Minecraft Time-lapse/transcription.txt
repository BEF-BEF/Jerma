[3.45s -> 16.98s]  Hello everyone, it's Jeremy's grandfather here again. Time to do an epic time-lapse
[16.98s -> 24.06s]  of Minecraft proportions. Today I'm gonna be doing a time-lapse of the Taj Mahal
[24.06s -> 30.83s]  and it's a place that's in India and it's a big building and it's gonna be so
[30.83s -> 36.39s]  much fun. So I hope everyone's ready to go on a magical journey. Let's do it
[36.39s -> 116.03s]  together. Here we go. That's uh, that's it. But don't even fucking look at me like that.
[116.03s -> 121.26s]  This game is hard, okay? This is one of the hardest games I've ever played. So what?
[121.26s -> 125.26s]  So what if it doesn't look like the Taj Mahal? You don't even know what the fuck
[125.26s -> 129.18s]  the Taj Mahal even looks like, you shithead. You're talking to somebody that
[129.18s -> 135.54s]  fought in the World War IIs. I fought in the Dinosaur-Human War of 1966 and I
[135.54s -> 139.38s]  fought in World War II as a fighter pilot. So if you want to fuck with me,
[139.38s -> 146.32s]  buddy, you got something coming and I will stick a knife into your face. And another thing, if you...
[146.32s -> 152.79s]  Rampart! What? Rampart, hey, Family Feud is on. Wait, what's going on? Family Feud is on. It's Monday, man.
[152.79s -> 161.32s]  Holy shit. It's Monday already? Yeah, let's go. That's the best show on TV. Holy shit. Fuck you.
[161.32s -> 166.32s]  Stop it, dude. Give me some food.
