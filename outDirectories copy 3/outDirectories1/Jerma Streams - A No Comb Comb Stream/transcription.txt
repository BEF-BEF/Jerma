[6.52s -> 15.22s]  Hey, how are you? This is your first stream you've ever been to? Wait, what's wrong? Oh, there's no music, hold on.
[15.22s -> 24.41s]  There, I got you, I got you, I got you. Sorry. What's up? How are you? Good to see you. The music is too quiet.
[24.41s -> 29.37s]  I got it, I got you, I got you, I got you. New, that way, this new person in the community? Hey, what's happening?
[29.85s -> 38.78s]  Ah, welcome. Gonna be a very short stream today. Very, very busy. We're gonna do, we're gonna hang out,
[38.78s -> 45.02s]  we'll talk about the chess boxing event. That was crazy, that was a lot of fun. I want to talk about
[45.02s -> 51.53s]  the Christmas stream coming up this weekend. That's gonna be a lot of fun too. It's not gonna be
[51.53s -> 59.70s]  15 minutes. No, I don't know, like, maybe like an hour? Couple hours? Whatever. Maybe like an hour and a half?
[59.70s -> 68.60s]  I don't know. Yeah, I want, I was trying to figure out an opportunity to be live because of all this
[68.60s -> 74.12s]  stuff going on. So, like, I got, there's a point right now where I could be live and just chill for
[74.12s -> 91.30s]  an hour or two. Have I taken a shower? Yes. Yes. I did take a shower. Did you? I have something very
[91.30s -> 100.31s]  important to go over. It's, it's how we're gonna open this. I've seen, I've seen some fake information
[100.87s -> 107.21s]  on the internet about how I take photos. And I'm gonna prove to everybody today exactly what's,
[107.21s -> 113.22s]  because I've seen it and it's making me a little irritated. You will go over it. I, it's gonna be
[113.22s -> 121.78s]  fine. And I'll be able to prove to everybody that no, I in fact am not standing on my tippy toes
[121.78s -> 127.14s]  in every photo to make sure that I'm 5'9 standing next to somebody that's 5'10.
[127.94s -> 134.90s]  That is not what is happening. And I keep seeing it. I keep seeing people go into the background
[134.90s -> 139.78s]  and go to where my feet are and they zoom in and they sharpen it and they sharpen it and they go,
[139.78s -> 144.98s]  look at his foot, look at his foot's off the ground. And I'm like, hey, that's not what's happening.
[144.98s -> 152.04s]  And I'm gonna prove it today. I want, I have to prove this because I was gonna like say something
[152.12s -> 157.24s]  I was like, what the hell would he, what's he talking about? I was gonna write, no,
[157.24s -> 161.88s]  just a tweet. I don't tweet ever, right? And imagine getting a tweet that's just me with no
[161.88s -> 167.56s]  context. No, I don't stand on my tippy toes in photos. Stop saying that about me. It's just like,
[167.56s -> 174.23s]  that's kind of weird. A post, like a really fun event. It'd be very strange to say. I just didn't.
[176.90s -> 181.54s]  But yeah, I, it's funny. I get it. But I'm gonna prove everybody today. And you need to see this
[181.54s -> 189.19s]  because there's no chance I'm gonna let that continue to stand. He doesn't have feet. Yes,
[189.19s -> 194.30s]  I do. We'll get, I'll prove it. But I want to wait. I want to wait till people get here
[194.30s -> 199.16s]  because it's, I want to wait for people trickling in. How come there's no comb today?
[200.04s -> 208.10s]  Guys, I lost it. I don't know. I don't know where it is for free. We're going to get a feed cam.
[209.51s -> 215.56s]  I mean, kind of, I guess it's, I mean, it's the focus of the first few minutes of the stream
[215.64s -> 222.06s]  are going to be me, how I stand in a photo. So I guess technically, technically, I guess
[222.78s -> 249.14s]  you ate the comb. Finally. He's looking sus today. I'm not even on camera. Skyrim, bro. Play it
[249.14s -> 254.25s]  already. I don't have time to play Skyrim today. I'm sorry. I'm not, I'm not playing Skyrim.
[255.18s -> 264.20s]  Get on cam right now. I'm just wait. It's the intro. Okay. How five minutes, what is the
[264.28s -> 269.16s]  percentage of five minutes to an hour? 60 minutes. What's five minutes of 60 minutes? What percentage
[269.16s -> 286.65s]  is that? How much percentage is that? 5% 6%. So 6% of this whole stream is already over. Oh shit.
[291.10s -> 297.43s]  That's actually kind of sad to think like that. Uh, that's a glass half empty mentality. I don't
[297.43s -> 308.12s]  like that. 8.3% of the stream is already over. What the hell? Show us the feet already then.
[311.02s -> 313.26s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[313.98s -> 320.34s]  Before we go over anything, obviously I've got, I've got to look, I've got a big event to hype.
[321.14s -> 333.67s]  I got a big event to hype this weekend. Stop wasting percentages. Okay. All right. All right.
[333.67s -> 337.27s]  All right. All right. All right. It's time. You guys ready? It's going to be jarring to a lot
[337.27s -> 341.98s]  of people because they're not used to seeing me like in a big, like full cam like this. And yeah.
[341.98s -> 346.09s]  Oh, it looks weird today. I don't care. What happened? Why does it look like you say computer
[346.09s -> 353.61s]  generator? It's because I am. All right. Fine. Whatever. How are you guys doing? Are you ready
[353.61s -> 359.37s]  for me to prove this? I'm going to go put like fucking shoes on. No, I don't even care. All
[359.37s -> 365.91s]  right. Here we go. There are, there are photos circulating of me staying. I took a lot of photos.
[365.91s -> 370.39s]  First of all, I took a lot of pictures at the chest boxing event, which was an unbelievable
[370.39s -> 374.23s]  event. That was a ton of fun. I've never done something like that, but there's a dick on the
[377.29s -> 408.07s]  what? Why is this drive? What the fuck? Hold on a second. Where is it coming? Where's that coming
[408.07s -> 416.79s]  from? I don't even, I don't know. I don't know what's even making that. Why is that there?
[418.33s -> 425.77s]  I, what's, I don't, I have no idea what could be doing that. Anyways, let's go for it. Here we go.
[425.77s -> 431.02s]  You ready? I've got to prove. Look, let me explain what's going on first. The dog hair all over me.
[431.02s -> 433.98s]  All right. Here we go. I got to do this because you're not going to be able to see me standing.
[436.63s -> 441.99s]  All right. So there's a lot of people that say he goes on his tippy toes. Look, just watch,
[441.99s -> 447.35s]  watch what he does. All those people are going to all have a fit at the same time. You ready? Watch
[447.35s -> 452.70s]  this. So I'm, I have to get the whole thing because there's no way people are going to
[452.70s -> 459.00s]  fucking clip it. They're going to like shrink me and hold on. We're not doing anything else
[459.00s -> 468.73s]  today until I do this. It's actually very important. Okay. So here we go. Can you hear me?
[469.29s -> 475.80s]  When I take photos, right? I stand, you know, sometimes you stand like this. Sometimes like a
[475.80s -> 482.68s]  photo. Sometimes you go like this. I took probably 200 photos with a crew and, and, and fans and,
[482.68s -> 485.16s]  and what have people came, the people that went to the event. It was awesome. It was like one of
[485.16s -> 489.24s]  the best experiences I've ever had in my whole life. So anyways, some of these photos, they,
[489.24s -> 499.99s]  they show my feet and people go, Oh bro, bro, LOL. Because my foot is like this. Are you ready for
[499.99s -> 505.83s]  this? So I pose. I pose when I take photos like this, you know, like, okay, here we go. Let's,
[505.83s -> 512.22s]  let's go ahead and see what happens. Let's pose. Hey, I'm posing right now. Let's put it down.
[514.76s -> 519.64s]  Nothing changed. It's just my knee coming out. It's just like, all right, let's go for it.
[520.97s -> 532.62s]  And people are saying, it's me going like this. I, no, it's not. It's this or this.
[533.26s -> 540.98s]  Sometimes it's back here. I didn't just grow in size, did I? I'm leaning on my left leg.
[542.55s -> 560.98s]  Look, nothing changed. I've been the exact same height. Ready? If you walk, bro, there you go.
[562.86s -> 579.67s]  Get this dick out of my room. How do I get rid of it? I don't know what's causing it. I'm not
[579.67s -> 583.21s]  touching it. I'm not going to touch it because people, hold on. Wait, I'm getting in front of it.
[583.21s -> 592.66s]  What is it? Okay. I'm blocking whatever it is right now. What is it? Tell me if it changes.
[598.49s -> 629.11s]  Changing this. I don't, I, I don't know why that's there. I, whatever. Okay. Hi, dude. I have to get
[629.11s -> 641.80s]  rid of people. That's so fucking stupid. What if, hold on, let me refresh the camera. No, it's just
[641.80s -> 647.90s]  there. It's probably, all right. It's going to change over time. Look, it's already moved.
[647.90s -> 667.75s]  This is actually insane. It's, it's, it's like shape shifting. It's going to, it's just going to
[667.75s -> 675.43s]  go, it's just going to go. All right. Anyways, so the chest boxing event was awesome, right? I,
[675.43s -> 683.98s]  I have never gone into a ring and done anything like that before. And I have to say being in front
[683.98s -> 693.10s]  of a huge audience, a huge crowd, it was like electric. It was so electric, in fact, that in
[693.10s -> 701.59s]  the intro, I got shown a lot of pictures. There's a point in the intro where my hair is standing up
[701.59s -> 709.70s]  like I'm being electrocuted. I got to find a photo and put up here. My hair was standing up as if I
[709.70s -> 718.02s]  was touching one of those, one of those electric kind of science balls. I have no idea why, because
[718.02s -> 722.57s]  it didn't happen during the rest of the event. There was so much that I think it was just the
[722.57s -> 727.21s]  arena was just so electric and maybe, I don't know, maybe there was some static in the air,
[727.21s -> 733.74s]  but it was, it was embarrassing because every major photo that I keep seeing from this is
[734.87s -> 744.70s]  that intro where I'm pointing into the crowd and my hair is like crazy looking. Is the dry air?
[745.26s -> 752.63s]  I don't know. You look like you, you look like you grocery shop at 6 a.m.
[754.36s -> 764.31s]  Uh dude, I don't, I don't, I haven't woken up at 6 a.m. since I was probably like fucking 10 years
[764.31s -> 774.33s]  old. You think I get up that early to go grocery shopping? You think, you think I've woken up
[774.33s -> 783.43s]  at 6 a.m. at any point in the last 15 years? No. Well, now you, it's no longer, it's no longer
[783.43s -> 793.61s]  a penis now. Now it's a just a series of three balls. Somebody said, is it culled in there?
[799.48s -> 803.40s]  6 a.m. comb stream. All right, but no, no, no. Okay, all right, all right, let's get on track.
[803.40s -> 810.41s]  Let's get on track. So a couple important things to know. One, the, there it is. All right,
[810.41s -> 815.24s]  I have to show this. Hold on. Wait, I'm going to go away for a second. I just want to make sure
[815.24s -> 827.94s]  this isn't, I have this in the right spot. Okay, so hold on. I'm just going to call it this. That's
[827.94s -> 839.56s]  fine. Okay, hold on. I don't use computers. And there we go. Okay, can you see it? No, you can't,
[839.56s -> 850.25s]  but you can in a, you will in a second. All right, so take a look. That's, this, that's kind of
[850.25s -> 862.06s]  insane. But it's weird because this didn't, it wasn't like that for the rest of the night.
[862.06s -> 868.39s]  You look like a mad scientist. Yeah, I don't know why it was happening, but it was funny nonetheless.
[868.39s -> 875.51s]  It's in all the professional photos. It's in all the, it's every, all the pro photos, the professional
[875.51s -> 881.59s]  photography that was taken, it looks way worse because it's so high definition, it's so HD.
[881.59s -> 888.74s]  But anyways, yeah, that's that. I've never done that before. It was really fun, but we have to
[888.74s -> 895.54s]  make, wait, let's, let's move on because we are, what's 15 minutes out of an hour? What is it?
[895.54s -> 906.01s]  15 minutes out of an hour is how, what percentage? 25% of this stream is over already. And all that
[906.01s -> 914.98s]  happened was a, a dick was on the wall. I mean, that's actually kind of, that's a kind of a major
[914.98s -> 921.06s]  event, wouldn't you say? That's kind of, that's a major event. All right, whatever. That's weird,
[921.06s -> 931.59s]  but we got to, all right. Anyways, so the haul, the, the holiday, I said how the holiday show
[932.60s -> 936.57s]  is this weekend. What you're going to want to do if you haven't, I haven't, because I haven't been
[936.57s -> 944.10s]  live, the poll, you have only a couple days left to vote on the poll. If you haven't do it,
[944.10s -> 953.21s]  you have only a few days. It's a huge poll. It's going to take you like all day. Somebody said
[953.21s -> 959.38s]  there are too many nominees, too many options. There were so many, you guys have no idea.
[959.38s -> 966.20s]  The mods got it first. All the nominees, they brought it down on a first pass. There were
[966.20s -> 974.44s]  thousands of thousands of nominations. When it went down for the first mod pass, me and Holly
[974.44s -> 978.28s]  took a look at it. Okay, we got to narrow some more of this stuff down. This is way too much.
[978.92s -> 987.83s]  You are seeing three passes of removing nominees from that list. And it's still that much. There
[987.83s -> 994.33s]  were 50 nominees in every category. It was crazy. It took me one and a half hours to go through it.
[994.33s -> 998.49s]  You can skip questions, by the way, if you don't care about what the worst cat puke was, which
[998.49s -> 1002.17s]  is I think probably the most skipped question on the whole poll, which is understandable.
[1002.89s -> 1007.45s]  You don't have to. You can just do the ones that you want to do. If like worst joke of the year,
[1007.45s -> 1011.37s]  you're just like, nah, I don't need to vote for that. Like, I mean, they were all like pretty good.
[1011.37s -> 1015.77s]  So just skip that one if you want to. That one, you should be skipping it and then go to the best
[1015.77s -> 1020.01s]  stuff, right? This worst face, worst joke, worst impression, you just skip those. You don't need
[1020.01s -> 1025.61s]  to do them. You can just do the best ones. Those are the ones that are the better ones, right? Yeah.
[1025.61s -> 1035.05s]  I almost just puked on my own spit. Oh, it's a panel, right? Below here, there's a panel that has
[1035.05s -> 1040.01s]  that link. If you don't feel like clicking on the link that showed up in the chat a thousand times.
[1040.01s -> 1044.97s]  Down here, there's a chat panel. New cat puke. You can't vote for it because in the gray period,
[1044.97s -> 1059.11s]  it's in the gray area. You can't do it. Dude, wait, what did you just say? Hold on. Remember,
[1059.11s -> 1080.39s]  you look like the yellow Eminem today. Yeah, I kind of do. What are you talking about? Why
[1080.39s -> 1117.48s]  did you know that? Why are you talking about that? Hold on a sec. Let's freak some people out that
[1117.48s -> 1131.53s]  just show up for the stream randomly. Oh, the yellow Eminem looks like he's trying to go on
[1131.53s -> 1138.23s]  his tippy toes, isn't he? With this picture. No, it's called a pose actually. What's going on down
[1138.23s -> 1173.46s]  here? Why are you doing that? Oh, it's called a pose. Give me a break. I don't look anything
[1173.46s -> 1194.04s]  like this guy. You have the same hair. That's not hair. Those are eyebrows. That's a dude. Wait,
[1194.04s -> 1209.10s]  you think this is his hair? That's not his hair. Those are eyebrows. That's actually kind of funny
[1209.10s -> 1235.74s]  because now I'm going to see that as his hair forever. You have the same eyebrows. Do I? I don't
[1235.74s -> 1256.12s]  have the same visor. Hey, uh, hey, uh, red Eminem. I think I, uh, oh, does Santa exist? No, he doesn't.
[1256.12s -> 1274.31s]  Don't worry. Is that close? Guys, I think they sell this hat. I could probably, they probably sell
[1274.31s -> 1288.36s]  this. Bernie Sanders. No, that's, hey, uh, hey, um, I think that, uh, we're Eminems. It's like that.
[1288.36s -> 1296.07s]  Yeah, he does exist. I do exist. Oh, I was doing Santa from that commercial. Hey, oh, yeah. Uh,
[1296.07s -> 1306.18s]  whoops. That's my bad. All right. Anyways, well, let's try the other way. I think this is actually
[1306.18s -> 1350.36s]  closer. This is not, oh, that's not right. No, I'm trying to just get it to be, you get the idea.
[1350.36s -> 1357.50s]  Who cares? All right. Anyways, what were we just talking about? Oops. All right. What were we
[1357.50s -> 1366.97s]  talking about? He's got a green, he's green mouth. All right. So yeah, there's nothing on the wall
[1366.97s -> 1370.89s]  anymore. We can move on. That just, we, that derailed 25% of the whole stream, by the way,
[1370.89s -> 1377.86s]  just in case you were wondering. So if you want to vote, the vote is open still. It's a big poll.
[1377.86s -> 1383.02s]  You don't have to vote on every single question if you don't want to. If it's there, if you want,
[1383.02s -> 1389.10s]  we're tallying it soon. It's going to be a really fun show. A lot of stuff planned for that show.
[1389.74s -> 1397.27s]  That is the 17th, starting at 4 p.m. Pacific time. You are going to see, I'm going to tweet about it.
[1397.27s -> 1401.83s]  There's going to be a big tweet. It's going to be tons of fun. I really hope that you show up there
[1401.83s -> 1414.41s]  because it's going to be a great time. Twizzler here. Do you do all your clothes shopping at the
[1414.41s -> 1422.90s]  kids section at Target? No. I actually do all my clothes shopping eight or nine years ago
[1422.90s -> 1429.45s]  and have never updated my wardrobe because it still fits. Should I be ashamed about that?
[1430.39s -> 1440.63s]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Back when I was 25, 24. Oh, my clothes still fit and I still feel just as
[1441.35s -> 1453.72s]  I fill out the clothes just like I did when I was in my mid-20s. Oh, no. Look at that. That's
[1453.72s -> 1465.42s]  pretty sustainable. I just, is this one backwards? No, I just, I can't buy new clothes. I always
[1465.42s -> 1471.37s]  forget everything about my body shape. Anytime you go get real clothes, you have to know stuff like
[1471.37s -> 1475.93s]  what's the diameter of your diaphragm? And like, you know, what's the, how long around your neck
[1475.93s -> 1482.33s]  is it? Yeah. How many inches? Well, you know, it's, I have a 30, 38, R slash, you know, slim fit.
[1482.33s -> 1492.06s]  It's too much to know. I don't care. I just, if it says M on it, I buy it. How long are these pants,
[1492.06s -> 1498.62s]  by the way? Oh, I, you see, I'm a 30, 30 waist, 32 waist and I have like a 30, 31. No, it's too much.
[1498.62s -> 1508.71s]  I don't care. Just give me a medium. Just give me a medium. And I like pants that like you can just
[1508.71s -> 1516.66s]  go like stretch. You know what I mean? Surprise, it's not extra small. I'm not, I, are you serious?
[1516.66s -> 1525.34s]  Do I have to stand up again? Is this extra small? That's extra small. That's extra small. But you
[1525.34s -> 1532.73s]  know what I mean? I don't, this arm is not extra small. I could lift, you know, if you, if you were
[1532.73s -> 1546.07s]  like right here, I could lift, I could lift you up. I'm not extra small. I'm just, I'm five, eight.
[1546.07s -> 1552.01s]  I don't, I fill out a medium shirt, by the way. I fill out a, what's, I'm not going to answer that.
[1555.16s -> 1559.72s]  No, you could not. Are you telling me that I don't fill out a medium shirt? Well, what is this? No,
[1559.72s -> 1570.97s]  I like this. Don't rip it. Would you consider this not being filled out? I want it. Tell me the truth.
[1570.97s -> 1577.90s]  I'm directly looking at you. Am I not filling this shirt out? This is a long sleeve shirt. You know,
[1577.90s -> 1594.84s]  I'm not filling this out nicely. This is a medium. And I got, hey, no further questions.
[1597.00s -> 1605.30s]  Looks a bit, it looks a bit tight. Dude, you couldn't lift a TV. That TV was 200 pounds, dude.
[1605.30s -> 1610.58s]  We weighed it on stream. Do you not remember that? Or were you not here for it? We weighed that TV
[1610.58s -> 1627.54s]  on stream and it was almost 200 pounds. Anyways, he's very feisty because I'm excited. It's going
[1627.54s -> 1638.38s]  to be a really fun weekend this weekend. I'm looking forward to it. Show us the tag because
[1638.38s -> 1645.70s]  if this is small, then I have to backtrack every single thing I said for the last 10 minutes.
[1645.70s -> 1654.04s]  This is the first comb stream for me. This is the first comb stream and it's found you through the
[1654.04s -> 1660.20s]  Hassan collab. I've been watching you ever since. What's the baseball stream? Oh, well,
[1661.48s -> 1672.30s]  the last part you made that up. What's a comb stream? A comb stream is, I used to comb my hair
[1672.30s -> 1682.38s]  and sit here for an hour and that's what it was. Do a fashion brand tier list? No, no, I don't think
[1682.38s -> 1694.98s]  so. All right. Well, actually I could. Hold on. Let me think. No, I couldn't. I would low key like
[1694.98s -> 1706.25s]  to see that. But what if I don't know? What if I don't know anything about clothes? And that's the
[1706.25s -> 1713.21s]  thing. Look, I know a lot of people really, people love fashion. They get into clothing and that's
[1713.21s -> 1716.89s]  awesome. That's cool. You can really express yourself with all kinds of clothes and different
[1716.89s -> 1725.08s]  styles and stuff, but I'm a gray sweatshirt Andy. I just, that's it. Gray sweatshirt Andy. I didn't
[1725.08s -> 1730.49s]  even need to be a name brand. I don't even care what it is. And running pants or jeans, just like
[1730.49s -> 1735.93s]  a standard, like gray sweatshirt, gray shirt Andy and jeans. I do like nice jeans though. A nice
[1735.93s -> 1748.87s]  pair of jeans is good. I will spend money on jeans. That's Mark Zuckerberg. You're wearing designer
[1748.87s -> 1757.66s]  brand right now? These are Nike pants. Are these, is Nike designer? Is Nike, no, Nike's not designer
[1757.66s -> 1774.01s]  brand. Is it? Are they? You have the Brett Favre outfits? Wait, Brett Favre wears gray shirts and
[1774.01s -> 1789.77s]  jeans? Yeah, but I mean, but it's, but they're comfortable. They're comfortable. I, I get so
[1789.77s -> 1794.81s]  sweat. Okay, so that suit, that was a pretty nice suit. I got it. I got it. It was a nice suit.
[1794.81s -> 1800.57s]  It fit pretty well, but I just feel, I just don't, I'd rather just be in a gray shirt and a
[1800.57s -> 1806.94s]  pair of jeans. Play Minesweeper. No, I'm not playing Minesweeper. I'd rather play Picross.
[1806.94s -> 1820.79s]  Do you remember wear it 50% right now? Well, that's not necessarily the case. Does Zuckerberg fit?
[1820.79s -> 1826.66s]  Is it? No, not really. Is it? Maybe a little. Is that the same suit from the Streamer Awards?
[1826.66s -> 1832.95s]  Nope, that one's different because I wanted to be in a black suit because announcer, right? I don't
[1832.95s -> 1838.17s]  know. I don't know the announcer fit that well. So that suit was blue. It was like kind of a bright
[1838.17s -> 1858.20s]  blue suit. You can do the Vampire Survivors DLC. You better believe it. Can you do a wood cutting
[1858.20s -> 1865.19s]  stream? No, compare your height to the door. I just did it. You know, all these height obsessed
[1865.19s -> 1889.22s]  handies in this chat. Who cares? If you're five, five, six feet, five, seven, five, eight, who cares?
[1889.22s -> 1896.92s]  It doesn't matter. Everybody gets on there like binoculars. How tall is he next to that person?
[1898.04s -> 1913.72s]  Hey, who cares? Considering you're like sorcery so much. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What'd you say?
[1913.72s -> 1919.94s]  Did you ever play the other Steve Jackson games like Warlock of Firetop Mountain? I did. I played
[1919.94s -> 1930.23s]  Warlock of Firetop Mountain on stream. It was the digital version of it though. It was pretty good.
[1930.23s -> 1935.82s]  Elden Ring update. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff. I don't know. We'll see. Can you please change your
[1935.82s -> 1947.48s]  pinned tweet? Maybe that's my New Year's resolution. My New Year's resolution. That's what it is.
[1947.48s -> 1958.52s]  Change my pinned tweet. Not, oh, I want to, you know, do this this year. I want to get in shape
[1958.52s -> 1963.64s]  this year. Oh, I'd like to do, I'm going to go to, I'm going to travel Europe this, maybe this year.
[1963.64s -> 1976.25s]  No, I'm going to change my pinned tweet. What a lazy fucking asshole. What a lazy asshole. Really?
[1976.25s -> 1985.34s]  I could do it right now. I could, it's right there. I could pick it up and I could change
[1985.34s -> 1995.69s]  my pinned tweet right now. I'm looking at it. My phone is right there. I'm, it's right here.
[1995.69s -> 1998.81s]  I could pick it up and I could change it to anything, but I'm not going to.
[1998.81s -> 2014.38s]  Try what's your six pack? All right, sure. No, no, we're not doing that. What's the plan today?
[2014.38s -> 2022.12s]  This is the plan. Christmas stream, holiday stream is coming up. There's going to be a tweet
[2022.12s -> 2031.64s]  about it. It's going to be a big show. I'm very, very excited for it. 17th, 4 p.m. Pacific. You
[2031.64s -> 2043.13s]  should be there. Take the wig off. No, I just got it on the right way. It's going to get delayed?
[2043.13s -> 2056.28s]  What? No, it's not. How's my health been? It's been all right. I don't talk about it anymore
[2056.28s -> 2061.96s]  because I think it's a downer for the streams, but it's still there. It's still something I
[2061.96s -> 2067.46s]  have to deal with. I have to figure out how I'm going to exactly do it, but I don't talk
[2067.46s -> 2073.53s]  about it anymore because I don't want it to be every, to get real for a second and not mess
[2073.53s -> 2080.89s]  around. To be able to talk about medical issues that I'm having, as long as I'm all right and
[2080.89s -> 2087.27s]  it's not going to take away from the actual streams and stuff, I'm not going to bring it
[2087.27s -> 2096.52s]  up every day. I did that for a while. I did. Back, I want to say back in early, in mid-2020
[2096.52s -> 2103.70s]  into 2021, it was something I talked about every day and I felt like it was kind of a downer. So
[2103.70s -> 2115.80s]  I just kind of kept at it. Still keeping at it. It was June 2020. Yeah. Give us updates. I will
[2116.44s -> 2124.42s]  if they come up. It didn't come off that way. Yeah, I know, but still. I'd rather this channel
[2124.42s -> 2132.10s]  be more about having a good time and just messing around and having fun than, I don't know, talking
[2132.10s -> 2144.76s]  about personal shit. But you know, that's the way it is. What do you say? You're going to add more
[2144.76s -> 2148.20s]  channel point rewards. Oh yeah, I forgot about that. I was supposed to add a bunch of channel
[2148.20s -> 2169.96s]  point stuff. What do you got? Let's see. Are there any more winks? No, not anymore. Can you do a VR
[2169.96s -> 2178.23s]  welding stream? Wait, you mean like get in the in the VR helmet and weld in VR? VR is something
[2178.23s -> 2190.57s]  that just really just destroys me every time. It really does. Do you like your car seat? I don't
[2190.57s -> 2198.65s]  have a car seat. Oh, you were saying, do you like your car seat headrest? I thought you were saying,
[2198.65s -> 2207.50s]  do you like your car seat? And I'm like, you're you're being kind of a dick. I don't even think
[2207.50s -> 2218.38s]  about that. I don't think about my whatever. When I'm driving, I don't sit there and go,
[2218.38s -> 2230.63s]  how does it feel? I don't I think it's it's fine. That's a band. Oh, it's a band. Oh, please,
[2230.63s -> 2243.77s]  Jerma. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. That went all over the
[2243.77s -> 2247.77s]  place. First, I thought you were making fun of me. Then I thought you actually wanted to ask a real
[2247.77s -> 2251.69s]  question about my how comfortable I was sitting in my car while I'm driving. And then I realized
[2251.69s -> 2260.97s]  that was wrong. That was almost strike three. Guys, he's like 38. Why would he listen to car
[2260.97s -> 2277.69s]  seat headrest? I don't know. I don't know. Hope they're good. Cool. It's a cool band, I guess.
[2277.69s -> 2299.61s]  I don't know. When are you gonna do modded Skyrim? Dude, you're the same age as my dad. I still fit
[2299.61s -> 2316.02s]  into my medium. All right. I still fit into my medium shirt. OK, I've still a medium. What does
[2316.02s -> 2324.63s]  that mean? I don't even know. I don't know what that's supposed to mean. But you're almost 40.
[2324.63s -> 2341.00s]  That chatter is 10. Is it mature content wording? You got to click that shit. Excuse me. I thought
[2341.00s -> 2346.36s]  you were 45. No, I just want everybody to think I'm 45. So when they actually figure out that I'm
[2346.36s -> 2352.78s]  37, they go, Whoa, he's oh, that's not 45. Oh, that's a lot younger than I thought. And yeah,
[2352.78s -> 2364.65s]  and I get and I went with 67% of the way through the stream. Oh, don't pass Jerma the aux cord.
[2371.08s -> 2380.47s]  Everybody was listening to me. Yeah, give it to me, actually. Give me the aux cord. You know why?
[2380.47s -> 2387.99s]  Because I would play like Halloween music through it and everyone would be at the party like,
[2387.99s -> 2390.66s]  yes, sick. And then all of a sudden they'd hear like,
[2393.78s -> 2400.26s]  and people would be like, who fucking did that? Who has the aux cord? Where are my jams?
[2400.26s -> 2410.17s]  Put on the monster bash. Actually, I think I think any party would like to hear that.
[2414.84s -> 2421.56s]  Honestly, tell me the truth. And I want ones in chat if you agree. If you were at a get together
[2421.56s -> 2425.66s]  or a party or some like nice event or an event or something that you went to,
[2425.66s -> 2432.04s]  if the monster mash came on loud, you would go like this, wouldn't you? And I know this is what
[2432.04s -> 2441.30s]  I would do. I'd go, yeah, yes. Oh, yeah. It was the monster mash. The monster. Everyone would just
[2441.30s -> 2447.51s]  start doing it. Nobody would be annoyed at that. No, it's not a Halloween party. This is at any
[2447.51s -> 2456.30s]  moment of any party you've ever gone to. I think I don't think I would trust the person that would
[2456.30s -> 2462.60s]  be upset that the monster mash was playing at the party. If somebody were there like,
[2462.60s -> 2472.46s]  this is stupid. What a dumb song. This is a fucking dumb song. You'd be like, well,
[2472.46s -> 2490.92s]  lose my number. The monster mash at Christmas. I hate the monster mash. Why? It's this,
[2490.92s -> 2494.60s]  I'm changing this because I don't want people to go like, oh, look at his hair over his eye.
[2507.64s -> 2510.92s]  You wouldn't play it at a funeral. No, you wouldn't. But what do you, what?
[2510.92s -> 2517.56s]  Okay, but hold on a minute. You wouldn't, oh, you wouldn't play that at a funeral. What,
[2517.56s -> 2526.38s]  what is appropriate for you to play at a funeral? That's not, you're going to play other, what other
[2526.38s -> 2531.40s]  music are you playing at the funeral? That's not monster mash. I don't think very much music fits
[2531.40s -> 2540.22s]  at a funeral, besides something, you know, unless it was a special request from somebody, right?
[2540.22s -> 2546.06s]  Their favorites. Yeah, that's what I mean. But okay, if the monster mash was their favorite song,
[2546.14s -> 2555.03s]  that's actually, all right, that gets everybody happy, I think. If it was like, yes, and now we're
[2555.03s -> 2562.31s]  going to thank you for those very good words, those kind words. Now, as we lower the casket,
[2562.31s -> 2576.17s]  we are going to be listening to his favorite song, monster mash. And it's just like, hold on,
[2576.17s -> 2582.90s]  how does it go? I need to hear it. I think that would be actually pretty, I don't know,
[2582.90s -> 2635.00s]  if they wanted to be there, then whatever. Monster mash. Is it going down? Okay, that's going off.
[2635.00s -> 2641.56s]  DMCA. Now, I mean, honestly, if I think about some of the all-time greatest pieces of music
[2641.56s -> 2648.55s]  to ever release, this has to be somewhere in the top 500, right? This is, would you put this in the
[2648.55s -> 2654.71s]  top 500 songs ever made? And I'm talking even Mozart and shit. Every piece of music ever,
[2654.71s -> 2663.11s]  ever invented, ever created, any Mozart, anybody. I think this fits in the top five, I think this
[2663.11s -> 2671.58s]  is in the top 500. What do you mean no? Yes, how would it not be? You don't think that this would be
[2671.58s -> 2675.66s]  in the same realm as Beethoven's like, fifth symphony.
[2724.76s -> 2740.42s]  Yeah, top 500. Do we do a Beethoven listening party? That would be strange. Would it be that
[2740.42s -> 2761.53s]  strange? I'd do a full Beethoven listening party. Is Beethoven DMCA? No, is it? Does anybody own
[2761.53s -> 2771.21s]  Beethoven's rights or something? What's the most famous Beethoven symphony? Beethoven famous song.
[2771.21s -> 2774.33s]  And don't tell me that that was weird for me to write because that was literally people were
[2774.33s -> 2782.60s]  writing that. That's like a huge, everyone's like typing that. Here we go, the best of Beethoven.
[2782.60s -> 2785.56s]  Wait, okay, does, is Beethoven the one that goes...
[2795.94s -> 2804.97s]  Is that Beethoven? That's Mozart, okay. Wait, is Beethoven the one that goes...
[2816.47s -> 2827.05s]  No, who's that? Not Star Wars, that's the Bumblebee song. That's not Star Wars. That wasn't Star
[2827.05s -> 2856.57s]  Wars, that was the Flight of the Bumblebee. What? Hold on, is it Star? No, it's not. What did I do?
[2856.57s -> 2863.54s]  This sounds like somebody desperately tried to get around, tried to make it so this wasn't that song,
[2863.54s -> 2869.85s]  but that's what they're doing. It sounds like the royalty-free version of that song that you're
[2869.85s -> 2876.22s]  talking about the... Dula Fates. This is the kind of shit that people would do, and I'm not saying
[2876.70s -> 2882.62s]  this is an unbelievably classic, unbelievable song. Huge music history, right? I'm just saying that
[2882.62s -> 2886.94s]  you think that I was doing Star Wars when I was just doing one of the most in the top 500 songs
[2886.94s -> 2895.43s]  ever made. I don't think Dula Fates is top 500 songs ever made. This should be there. Dula Fates
[2895.43s -> 2905.05s]  is not in there. This is in there. That's a bad take. I thought you hated classical music. What?
[2905.05s -> 2914.95s]  I mean, I don't like listen... All right, that was me saying I don't like listen to... Not like I
[2914.95s -> 2925.56s]  don't like classical music. I don't like listen to it. Get a comb. No, I don't have one. Wait,
[2925.56s -> 2940.34s]  Beethoven. So wait, what about... Wait. That's Beethoven. All right. What's the number one
[2940.34s -> 2952.42s]  most important song ever made? I don't know. What's the most important song ever made? Happy
[2952.42s -> 2957.42s]  birthday. Happy birthday. I've got it already. Happy birthday. It's the most important. It's
[2957.42s -> 2961.02s]  the number one. It's the number one most important song. It's the number one song.
[2961.02s -> 2970.57s]  Can you imagine a world without happy birthday? Happy birthday is the most important piece of
[2970.57s -> 2987.38s]  music ever released. Actually, think about it. That song sucks. But it... Even if you think it
[2987.38s -> 2996.54s]  sucks, it's still... It's probably the most important song to ever have been made. It's...
[2997.34s -> 3003.32s]  What other piece of media... Oh, yeah. Hold on a minute. You're telling me that happy birthday is
[3003.32s -> 3010.82s]  not the number one single most important piece of media ever released musically. Let's talk about
[3010.82s -> 3021.50s]  this. Right now. Right now. Listen to me. Right now. There are probably... This is being sung
[3021.50s -> 3027.69s]  right now in probably hundreds of thousands of locations. At this very second right now,
[3027.69s -> 3030.92s]  right now, someone's singing it right now. There's a birthday party going on right now
[3030.92s -> 3038.31s]  somewhere in the world, and it's being sung right now. Probably thousands of them.
[3041.19s -> 3047.43s]  How many places right now is Beethoven's Fifth Symphony playing? Maybe in a dentist office
[3047.43s -> 3058.66s]  somewhere. How many dentist offices are open right now? I think there's more birthdays right
[3058.66s -> 3085.98s]  now than dentist office currently in operating hours. I think a happy birthday has a beat.
[3085.98s -> 3091.53s]  I'm telling you, this is being played in like a million locations. Let's think about this.
[3091.53s -> 3097.58s]  Honestly, I'm fucking a little hyped up about this, but seriously, it's Christmas time right now.
[3099.66s -> 3105.66s]  I still think happy birthday is being sung in more locations right now than Christmas music
[3105.66s -> 3114.02s]  being played in malls right now. I think so. All right. Do a poll. I want one of the malls to do a
[3114.02s -> 3120.95s]  poll. Is it your birthday today? Is it... There's 20,000 people here. How many people's birthdays?
[3120.95s -> 3127.40s]  Be honest, please. Or I'll ban you. Is it your birthday right now? I've seen every single... Are
[3127.40s -> 3133.24s]  you kidding me? Every single stream I look over here, and every 10 seconds, hey dude, it's my
[3133.24s -> 3142.58s]  birthday today. How many... Is it your birthday right now? Whose birthday is it today? All right.
[3143.46s -> 3149.14s]  Let's assume that even half these people are lying. Let's assume that even 90% of these people are
[3149.14s -> 3161.77s]  lying. If it's even 1%. And then follow up question to this. Did you sing happy birthday today
[3161.77s -> 3166.60s]  at some point? And how many people were in the room? Because you got probably five different
[3166.60s -> 3172.41s]  locations where it was coming out. So that is an audio equipment. That's a piece of audio equipment.
[3172.41s -> 3177.69s]  If there's 50 people in a room, that is 50 pieces of 50 different places it's coming out from.
[3177.69s -> 3187.61s]  It's in the millions every day. It's the most important piece of music ever released.
[3187.61s -> 3198.41s]  Okay, yeah. So it's a lot of people. It's at least 100 people here every day. There's other
[3198.41s -> 3210.38s]  songs in non-English countries. It's probably A, B, C, D. Wait, hold on. There's other songs?
[3210.38s -> 3224.41s]  That's right. But wait, hold on. But hold on. We're just talking in like North America.
[3224.41s -> 3230.78s]  It's important. Just wait. It's not important. It's prevalent. I don't know. I think at some point
[3230.78s -> 3236.25s]  extreme prevalence gets to importance, right? If there are a million people right now singing
[3236.25s -> 3245.29s]  Happy Birthday, it's a fairly important song. A, B, C's. Okay, how many people right now? Who cares?
[3245.29s -> 3255.11s]  We're wasting valuable percentage time on this. It's literally the same song.
[3257.91s -> 3263.99s]  What point is he trying to make? The point is that I think Happy Birthday is number one most
[3263.99s -> 3269.94s]  important piece of music ever. And I'm being yelled at because people are saying it's A, B, C.
[3269.94s -> 3274.68s]  But then we're also talking about not North America. I mean just in North America.
[3274.68s -> 3284.39s]  Is A, B, C the same song? No, it's not. A, B, C, D. Is it Happy Birthday?
[3288.98s -> 3300.98s]  This is not even the right- what? This is it. A, B, C. This is not it.
[3305.13s -> 3321.00s]  Birthday. It's Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. You had it wrong. Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star
[3321.00s -> 3328.30s]  could be up there too because a lot of, you know, oh, it's nap time. Twinkle, Twi- Is that happening
[3328.30s -> 3334.33s]  more than Happy Birthday? You know the point I'm making and it's in a weird way but you get it.
[3334.33s -> 3338.49s]  You all know what is happening right now. Don't give me the question marks. You all get it. You
[3338.49s -> 3342.73s]  all know what's happening right now. I'm not hearing the question marks. I can't hear them.
[3342.73s -> 3352.65s]  I'm not- I'm not gonna listen to them. They're all the same song. We don't live in the fucking
[3352.65s -> 3364.98s]  40s. This is so many chatters first comb stream and it shows. I haven't done one of these in a
[3364.98s -> 3369.06s]  long time where I just put the cam up and just do nothing and just talk at nothing. That's what
[3369.06s -> 3381.08s]  these are. Just because waiters are forced to sing it at an outback doesn't mean it's important.
[3381.08s -> 3387.24s]  Dude, come on. It- But what about the person's birthday that's at the outback right now? That's
[3387.24s -> 3391.40s]  not important to you? Well, I mean, I know you probably don't give a shit because you don't know
[3391.40s -> 3397.18s]  this person but that- you don't think that's important in the- in the social scheme of the
[3397.18s -> 3406.82s]  world? That it's not important to that person? No. Fuck them. Fuck that guy. Holy shit, you guys
[3406.82s -> 3423.77s]  are mean. No, fuck that guy. Birthdays happen without the song. I'm- I hate getting sung to
[3423.77s -> 3436.62s]  at restaurants. It's so embarrassing. Who cares about birthday Bob? Well, guess what? When it's
[3436.62s -> 3441.66s]  your birthday and you're at a restaurant and somebody comes over and is singing to you and
[3441.66s -> 3447.37s]  all of a sudden you hear, fuck that guy. Who gives a shit about that guy? Why is that guy so important?
[3447.37s -> 3455.38s]  Fuck him. Like, sorry, it's not your birthday today other guy here. Like, relax. Why would you
[3455.38s -> 3460.70s]  get mad at somebody else having a birthday? Can I be really honest with this chat right now?
[3460.70s -> 3463.98s]  Are you upset at somebody else having a birthday? You're gonna get one too.
[3467.05s -> 3473.16s]  Fuck that guy. Fuck his birthday. What? He's having a birthday party. You don't- you- what are you-
[3473.16s -> 3483.40s]  you mad at a guy having a birthday party? I'm not a negative Nancy. Okay, everybody does the same
[3483.40s -> 3487.75s]  thing at when this happens. Okay, you're at a restaurant. You're sitting across or you're
[3487.75s -> 3491.99s]  with some group and you're talking, oh yeah, and this is what everybody does. And it's fine. And
[3491.99s -> 3496.55s]  whatever. Your camera quality is ass. It's never changing. I don't care. I'm gonna actually make it
[3496.55s -> 3504.44s]  worse the more that I hear complaints. So, um, you just messed up my train of thought. What was it?
[3504.44s -> 3512.71s]  Twinkle, twinkle little star, happy birthday to you. Number one song. It's 500- top 500 songs.
[3512.71s -> 3516.39s]  What's the top 500? Number one. We're at a restaurant now. Okay, the restaurant. Oh, okay.
[3516.39s -> 3520.55s]  So, we're sitting at the restaurant and there's only one minute left. We're still live. Don't
[3520.55s -> 3525.51s]  worry. So, we're sitting at the restaurant and I'm sitting across. Everybody does the same exact
[3525.51s -> 3532.89s]  thing. You start going, yeah, yeah, I mean, the DLC is going to be kind of fun. What's, um, what,
[3532.89s -> 3537.69s]  you have, uh, you have a couple kids now, don't you? And then, happy birthday to you. And everyone
[3537.69s -> 3556.25s]  goes. And then you just go, hey. So, I mean, the DLC is going to be kind of fun. What a big deal.
[3556.98s -> 3564.97s]  Oh, no. You had interrupted for 10 seconds. They get to have a birthday party. It's time. It's not
[3564.97s -> 3574.01s]  time. It's time when I, I'll leave when I want to leave. Why did you grunt it instead of singing it?
[3574.01s -> 3580.76s]  Because I had to show you the emotional impact of when you're sitting there and it happens.
[3580.76s -> 3587.29s]  Bye, Jerma. Before everybody leaves, because I know some of you, I know, but I know this community
[3587.29s -> 3590.49s]  very well. Three or four thousand of you are going to leave for a joke and it's funny.
[3592.65s -> 3598.12s]  The top 500 jokes ever made, I think. I don't think it makes the top 500.
[3598.52s -> 3606.73s]  But, yeah. So, very important stuff. 17th, 4 p.m. The Holiday Extravaganza. I'm actually
[3606.73s -> 3610.65s]  very excited for it. A lot of work has gone into this. It's going to be a big, fun fucking event.
[3610.65s -> 3615.05s]  The awards are going to happen there. Got a ton of fun activities planned.
[3615.05s -> 3624.38s]  You'll see when you see it. I'm so excited for it. 17th. 17th. The 17th is a Saturday. This
[3624.38s -> 3631.35s]  Saturday, 4 p.m. Pacific. Also, vote on the poll if you haven't, if you really want to. And you're
[3631.43s -> 3636.15s]  like, wait, there's a poll? There is. There's like a million questions to answer. If you don't want
[3636.15s -> 3639.27s]  to do it, you don't have to, but if you want to, go ahead and vote for your favorite and least
[3639.27s -> 3644.58s]  favorite things of the year. That's what we do every year here. No, we're not doing it on New
[3644.58s -> 3658.71s]  Year's Eve anymore. When does the poll close? The poll is going to close in the next 48 hours.
[3658.71s -> 3667.03s]  You understand? Does that mean Battleaxe is delayed? I just made that up, but somebody
[3667.03s -> 3672.55s]  said something similar to that and I just changed it. Battleaxe is going to happen
[3672.55s -> 3684.87s]  a little bit later on next year. Early next year. Fog is coming. No, I'm good. We're good.
[3684.87s -> 3697.40s]  I told you one to two hours. I didn't say one hour even. Nice bong hit voice. Exclamation point
[3697.40s -> 3704.10s]  awards if you want to see it pop up in the chat. Also, make sure that you type in exclamation point
[3704.10s -> 3710.26s]  awards to find yourself going up against a cool poll. It's there and it's exciting and it's ready
[3710.26s -> 3717.78s]  to go. Also, make sure to tune in on the 17th at 4 p.m. Tons of activities, potential things that
[3717.78s -> 3735.96s]  are fun and let's get to it. All right, let's go. Scripted Sally. Yeah, you got another couple days.
[3735.96s -> 3751.27s]  That's my favorite news broadcast. Hey, thanks. We got a lot of, no, I'm not going to say anything
[3751.27s -> 3761.59s]  because I know what happens if I say something. I'm just kind of reading now. I'm just reading
[3761.59s -> 3768.41s]  the chat. I'm just sitting here going, add a laugh track to your streams. I think we did that a while
[3768.41s -> 3783.29s]  back. It was funny for a little bit. When are you going to do more Breath of the Wild? I don't know.
[3783.29s -> 3789.34s]  At some point after the holidays. There's been a lot of stuff going on. Tons of, I feel like I've
[3789.34s -> 3794.44s]  been, the last few months especially, I've just kind of been like back and forth, back and forth,
[3794.44s -> 3800.52s]  doing all kinds of stuff, moving all over the place. Tons of meetings and, oh meeting Andy,
[3800.52s -> 3807.00s]  business Andy. I know, but still like it's been, there's been a lot going on. So after the holidays,
[3807.00s -> 3817.75s]  we'll get back to it. What did you say? Are you going to play Frog Detective 3?
[3817.75s -> 3821.83s]  I was going to play Frog Detective 3 last week, but I just didn't have time for it.
[3821.83s -> 3826.65s]  Something else had to take its place. He's very sassy today. I think I'm just excited.
[3829.43s -> 3838.23s]  Every time we do the awards, it's exciting. I don't know. It's just fun. It's just, it's just,
[3838.23s -> 3841.59s]  it's going to be like a fun time. I just, that's what I know because it always is.
[3841.59s -> 3850.07s]  So it's fun to get excited about stuff. Sorry, I'm getting excited about stuff.
[3850.07s -> 3854.92s]  Your hair looks weird. I mean, oh, that's probably why.
[3857.67s -> 3868.49s]  Can you please punch the hole through your drywall? Why would I do that? I would like,
[3869.13s -> 3877.11s]  I want to know one reason for me to do that. Like why would I do that? Because it'd be funny.
[3877.11s -> 3881.53s]  Would it though? Like would that, would that be funny to you? I mean maybe, but then there's
[3881.53s -> 3889.24s]  just a hole in my wall and I have to deal with it. I don't want a hole in my wall. Find out what's
[3889.24s -> 3911.96s]  behind it. It's dust and insulation. Go wash your hair. My hair is clean. It's just this,
[3911.96s -> 3919.67s]  hold on, let me see. It's this piece here that people get so upset about. It's this thing right
[3919.67s -> 3928.33s]  here. What if I just turn this room on next and this was just shaved off, gone? No, I like it and
[3928.33s -> 3942.71s]  it's staying. So that's what's staying. Shave your head. I, you know what? I'm actually terrified.
[3943.58s -> 3950.74s]  I am terrified of eventually when I have to have a bald head if it ever happens,
[3950.74s -> 3956.82s]  I try to get enough sleep. I try to drink, you know, green tea. Green tea is really good for your
[3956.82s -> 3963.38s]  hair. If you didn't know, green tea is a, it has a compound in it that's really, it's good for your
[3963.38s -> 3971.06s]  scalp and it's good for your hair growing and maintaining. It's good for you. And when this
[3971.06s -> 3978.74s]  goes, I'm going to look fucking weird. I'm going to look strange with a bald head if I ever have
[3978.74s -> 3993.98s]  to have a bald head. I hope it never happens. Herbal remedy, Andy. Green tea is good for you.
[3993.98s -> 4006.47s]  I'm pretty sure that that's been the case for the last few thousand years. I think,
[4008.60s -> 4015.58s]  what do you mean herbal remedy, Andy? Green, I didn't tell you. I just said green tea is good
[4015.58s -> 4022.82s]  for you, which it is. If I told you to eat an apple today, would you go, oh yeah,
[4023.54s -> 4029.96s]  apple remedy, Andy. Apples are good for you. They're just, they're, they're a fruit and they
[4029.96s -> 4041.06s]  are a good part of a diet that, a balanced diet. He's selling us essential oils. I've said Andy
[4041.06s -> 4053.02s]  a lot today. You notice that? I would do anything you tell me. Okay. All right. All right. Okay.
[4053.02s -> 4063.75s]  Okay. Really? Okay. Make sure you drink enough water. Make sure you drink enough water. Make
[4063.75s -> 4071.86s]  sure you get enough sleep. Try to incorporate some more, um, active activities in your life.
[4071.86s -> 4076.18s]  I'm not talking like, you know, go work out of the gym every single day. You know,
[4076.18s -> 4079.62s]  every so often take a walk, right? Just take a walk, get yourself active, drink a little bit
[4079.62s -> 4093.77s]  more water. Um, try to get more sleep if you can. There you go. Yeah. Let's do it. I'll do
[4093.77s -> 4101.40s]  anything except those things specifically. Okay. Fine. Um, hey, here you go. If you haven't been in
[4101.40s -> 4106.12s]  a while, go get a, go get a checkup with the doctor, right? Just go check, just go get physical.
[4106.12s -> 4112.97s]  How am I doing? How, how's it going here? How's my body doing? Go, go get a physical. Go to the
[4112.97s -> 4119.37s]  dentist. Go check on your, maybe go check and see how things are going up there, right? No, I can't
[4119.37s -> 4136.38s]  do that. No, I won't do that either. Okay. Um, start moisturizing your face. Start moisturizing
[4136.38s -> 4141.24s]  your face. Just a little bit out of the shower and just like here. Let me show you where we do
[4141.24s -> 4146.36s]  it. Nothing, nothing with a bunch of junk in it, right? Just a nice quality. You don't have to
[4146.36s -> 4151.98s]  spend that much money on this stuff. And it's just face moisturizer, especially with those people in
[4151.98s -> 4157.82s]  a dry environment. It's just a little bit. You don't need much. Nice circles here, here, down the
[4157.82s -> 4174.46s]  nose, on the chin, down the neck. Moisturize. Okay. No, I'm not doing that either. I'm not, I don't do
[4174.46s -> 4186.20s]  that. I'll do anything but that too. What's my morning routine? It's actually pretty simple.
[4187.93s -> 4197.24s]  Are you ready? This is not medical advice. This is very, just what I personally do. But what I'm
[4197.24s -> 4205.02s]  going to tell you is not medical advice anyways. I get up in the morning, whatever that is, and I
[4206.36s -> 4212.66s]  grab my phone. It's usually kind of, it's usually next to me here. I grab my phone with one eye open
[4212.66s -> 4219.38s]  and I go, I just kind of scroll for about 10 minutes. Eventually I open the other eye and
[4219.38s -> 4225.08s]  everything is blurry and it sucks. It's like I'm seeing double vision because I had this eye closed
[4225.08s -> 4230.28s]  for too long because I'm kind of just like still half asleep. So I let that, you know, you don't
[4230.28s -> 4237.13s]  don't do that shit. It's like kind of sucks. Eventually I get awake. I get out of bed. I go
[4237.13s -> 4248.65s]  downstairs. I get my robe on. I tie it down. I then get in my elevator and I go up four or five
[4248.65s -> 4257.05s]  floors and I go to my coffee station. And then once I get up there, I obviously thank the other
[4257.93s -> 4268.04s]  people that are, I couldn't keep going with it. I couldn't, I tried. It was just too much.
[4268.04s -> 4271.16s]  Anyway, I was going to talk about like, I have like, yeah, like a Scrooge McDuck house.
[4278.18s -> 4286.66s]  No, I wake up, I drink coffee. After I drink coffee, I have to, I always try to drink,
[4286.66s -> 4293.34s]  I drink coffee. Listen, I, you go to the bathroom room every morning. If I don't drink my morning
[4293.34s -> 4301.14s]  coffee, I, it's over. The whole day is ruined. Everything is ruined. Not because, oh, I need my
[4301.14s -> 4307.11s]  morning coffee because I don't, I need to wake up. No, that's not what it's for. My morning coffee
[4307.11s -> 4317.94s]  has nothing to do with caffeine. Nothing. Zero. It's only to make sure that I can take a shit
[4317.94s -> 4324.82s]  because it's nothing worse than starting your day and you get halfway through the day and you still
[4324.82s -> 4333.66s]  haven't, it hasn't happened yet and it ruins the entire day. I cannot operate until I have my
[4333.66s -> 4343.21s]  morning coffee shit. It's every day. If I do not have that routine, the day is ruined. Ruined. I
[4343.21s -> 4350.06s]  have gone to places before, some events, some things, some, you know, family get togethers where,
[4350.06s -> 4355.16s]  all right, we're meeting up at this place. So we're doing this at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m.
[4355.16s -> 4363.56s]  and where's my coffee? I need coffee. I need my coffee in the morning and I have to wait until it
[4363.56s -> 4373.66s]  happens. So, oh, it's a big deal. So you, I drink my morning coffee. I go to the bathroom and then
[4373.66s -> 4378.94s]  I'm ready to start the day. Then I take, I take a shower, you know, quick shower. Doesn't need to be
[4378.94s -> 4385.50s]  too long. Just enough to, you know, wash my hair, put a little conditioner in, clean off. And then
[4385.50s -> 4390.12s]  after, it's because you're addicted to caffeine. I don't, I don't care whatever you're saying. I'm
[4390.12s -> 4397.38s]  just telling you, it's, this has been like 20 straight years, okay? People, the viewers are
[4397.38s -> 4406.30s]  leaving. I don't, whatever. So I end up, after I have my coffee, after I have my morning coffee
[4406.30s -> 4416.47s]  shit, I take a shower. I get out, dry off. I moisturize after it's dry. After my armpits are dry, I
[4417.11s -> 4439.62s]  put on some deodorant and then I put some clothes on and let's go. End the stream now. Shut off.
[4439.62s -> 4459.61s]  How's that sound? How's that sound? You do a cheese tier list. That's the highlight. I'm sassy. I am
[4459.61s -> 4473.29s]  not sassy. You, okay. Nope. I ain't taking this today. You can't say, you, all right, if you,
[4473.37s -> 4480.81s]  if you just, hey, end the stream. End the stream, loser. Hey, how about you shut up?
[4483.91s -> 4489.46s]  What did you, hey, what did you say to me? Hey, that's not a lot. Hey, that's not fair.
[4490.58s -> 4498.14s]  Everybody get him. That's not how it works. You can't yell at me and then I, and I respond to
[4498.14s -> 4506.15s]  you yelling and it's like, hey, you, what did you say to me? It's like, oh, hey, I'm just walking
[4506.15s -> 4514.36s]  down the street and somebody like, oh, what the? And they go, yeah. And then I grab them and they
[4514.36s -> 4519.40s]  go, hey, hey, what's happening? Look over me. Hey, don't, no, hey, I don't want any trouble with you.
[4520.66s -> 4538.70s]  Excuse me? Uh-huh. What are you talking about? GTA NPC? What do you mean 1950s NPC? What does
[4538.70s -> 4560.01s]  that even mean? GTA NPC? NPC interaction. What do these mean? He's inventing scenarios. No,
[4560.01s -> 4565.54s]  I'm just telling you, I'm making a point that if somebody, he likes, if somebody screams at you,
[4566.42s -> 4569.94s]  okay, let me, well, you didn't scream, but he's still like, you said a comment then I'm replying
[4569.94s -> 4578.70s]  to it. All right. So it's like, you ready? Here we go. This is, this is what you like me to do.
[4578.70s -> 4592.70s]  Fuck you. Dork. Eat shit. Loser. Fuck you. Dork. Eat shit. Fuck you. Loser. Dork. Eat shit. Loser.
[4592.70s -> 4613.82s]  Dork. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Hip squeak is better. Hit dork one more time. Okay. Eat shit.
[4613.82s -> 4619.48s]  That's not it. Loser. Fuck you. The one that I deleted. I don't have it anymore. Hold on.
[4619.48s -> 4625.61s]  This is what? This guy's going off the deep end. I'm, I'm proving a point. You never even
[4625.61s -> 4631.88s]  do a column stream before, whatever. In GTA, the NPCs will sometimes randomly insult you.
[4631.88s -> 4636.28s]  And in the newer games, you can insult back, but it just makes the NPCs fight you.
[4639.86s -> 4647.46s]  That's true. I forgot about that. That's actually funny. Yeah. It's like, hey, get away from me,
[4647.46s -> 4664.07s]  you fucking loser. Hey, fuck you. What's that? You should stop swearing. I actually had this
[4664.07s -> 4669.59s]  conversation with myself recently. I'm not kidding. I, I, I want to stop. I want to bring my
[4669.67s -> 4677.29s]  swear words down. I say too many swear words, I think. I'm a, I swear and I want to do a little
[4677.29s -> 4681.05s]  less swearing, but it's never going to happen. I say this every year. It's my new year's resolution.
[4681.05s -> 4706.09s]  You have a potty mouth. It's your only redeeming quality that I swear. Weird. I remember in GTA 5,
[4706.09s -> 4710.41s]  I would just be standing and for some reason that made an NPC get pissed off and fight me.
[4710.41s -> 4717.14s]  Oh yeah. If there's like a, an NPC just standing there and you stand like here, sometimes they'll
[4717.14s -> 4738.26s]  just go and they'll just come after you. What did you say? You look what? Your room looks like
[4738.26s -> 4760.97s]  a liminal space. Your room looks like a Gmod map. What are you talking about? You look like you're
[4760.97s -> 4766.12s]  in front of a green screen. I can't believe there was a dick over here earlier. I cannot believe
[4766.12s -> 4782.89s]  that. It was bad. That was, that was something. Well, not, it was, it was your first commentary.
[4782.89s -> 4788.92s]  I'm okay. No, that doesn't mean nothing. It's just that over, you weren't here earlier is what I
[4788.92s -> 4795.13s]  should have said. You weren't here earlier, which is what I should have just said, but it's not what
[4795.13s -> 4802.28s]  I said. There was a dick over here. A fake one and not, no, there was a, somebody explain it please
[4802.28s -> 4808.23s]  before I look, I'm going crazy. Can somebody help me please? Somebody help me here. I need,
[4808.23s -> 4812.07s]  somebody help me in a mod or somebody in chat. Clear the chat. Clear the chat and somebody
[4812.07s -> 4818.49s]  explain it. A light was on there up here and it was in the shape of a whatever. Somebody help me.
[4824.92s -> 4851.08s]  No hell. Look into liminal spaces. So, I think that's it. It looks like you're in front of a
[4851.08s -> 4861.40s]  green screen. It's just cause, I don't know, it's like a shitty lit room. Can you raise an eyebrow
[4861.40s -> 4868.18s]  and stare into the camera? No, I don't feel like it. All right. We are at, and this is only going
[4868.18s -> 4872.10s]  to be a show. I just wanted to come in, come over here and just hype up the holiday stream.
[4872.97s -> 4876.65s]  This weekend, again, vote on the poll. And wait, wait, there's other important stuff that I forgot
[4876.65s -> 4888.74s]  to talk about. Hold on. How quickly can I get through some of these? I'll talk about it later
[4888.74s -> 4900.87s]  because I got some stuff I have to take care of. Please sing the Family Guy theme before you leave.
[4900.87s -> 4913.34s]  No. Oh, okay. Grotto Beasts. Grotto Beasts. If we can get a link, it's coming soon. It's coming
[4913.34s -> 4923.03s]  very soon. Grotto Beasts is almost upon us. Keep an eye on the Twitter. Grotto Beasts are being
[4923.03s -> 4929.22s]  teased on Twitter every so often. If you want to see some of the characters that are in this game,
[4929.22s -> 4937.08s]  it's a full trading card game, by the way. Go check it out. Grotto Beasts. Grotto Beasts. What
[4937.08s -> 4943.08s]  else should I do? Because I know I'm not going to be around for a while before the stream. What
[4943.08s -> 4945.72s]  else? Something else. There's got to be something else I can talk about for the next two seconds.
[4945.72s -> 4954.54s]  Oh, vote on the poll. The end of the year awards. It's not, a lot of people think it's just,
[4958.02s -> 4965.69s]  dude, the yonkies plonky. Holy shit. What does this mean? What is this? What is this?
[4965.69s -> 5002.90s]  That's so sweet. I loved that every second of it. Wow. Oh my goodness. I don't even know what to
[5002.90s -> 5014.20s]  say. That was like really cool. I'm going to cry. No. That's Tom Kenny, by the way. Voice of Spongebob.
[5014.20s -> 5018.68s]  Probably. All right. You want to do like, you want to do top 500 of voice actors to ever live?
[5019.48s -> 5026.41s]  Uh, that's close to one. Very close. Very close to number one. That's in the top 10 at least.
[5026.41s -> 5049.61s]  Tom Kenny. Absolute legend. What else? I wonder what that list would look like.
[5050.41s -> 5062.39s]  There's a lot of people that could be on that list. All right. All right. Well, okay. The awards.
[5062.39s -> 5067.11s]  December 17th. Keep an eye on the Twitter. There's going to be a big tweet. There's going to be a big
[5067.11s -> 5076.65s]  tweet. Marketing Andy coming through here. Big tweet coming in this afternoon, this evening.
[5076.65s -> 5083.82s]  Awards this weekend. Vote on the poll if you haven't. 27 categories. Tons of activities.
[5083.82s -> 5096.50s]  An entire extravaganza. All evening. 4 p.m. Pacific. This weekend. Right here. Right here.
[5096.50s -> 5100.55s]  All right. Bye. See you this weekend, guys. Seriously, thanks for watching. I didn't even
[5100.55s -> 5104.87s]  talk about the chest. What happened? I didn't talk about chest boxing. That was one of the
[5105.43s -> 5110.23s]  most unbelievable experiences of my entire life. I didn't even talk about it. I said one comment
[5110.23s -> 5118.38s]  about how my hair was electrified. Shit. Oh my god. I was going to talk about a whole thing.
[5120.66s -> 5123.78s]  All right. Let me do it. I got a little bit of time. Let me go through this really quickly.
[5125.50s -> 5132.86s]  There was a period. The event was unbelievable, first of all, right? Ludwig. Just absolutely
[5132.86s -> 5137.67s]  legendary status. When he's like, hey, do you want to do this? Do you want to come on and do
[5137.67s -> 5143.59s]  that? It's just like, of course I do. Dude, of course I fucking do. So much fun. The air in that
[5143.59s -> 5148.39s]  arena was just so... The energy was awesome. It was an unbelievable time. But something else
[5148.39s -> 5155.10s]  that happened that it was... I don't know. I just want to say it very quickly. After the event,
[5155.10s -> 5158.86s]  it was over and people were kind of leaving. There was a lot of people that came up to me
[5158.86s -> 5164.41s]  after the event and were like, hey, can you sign this? Can we take a picture or whatever?
[5164.41s -> 5170.09s]  And it was a lot of people. And there may have been some people that I missed just because
[5170.09s -> 5174.41s]  people had to get kind of trickled out and everything. And there were lots and lots of
[5174.41s -> 5177.77s]  people. So I just want to say to those of you that came up to me and saying like, hey,
[5177.77s -> 5183.75s]  thanks for the streams and stuff. I don't even know what to say. It was an incredible experience.
[5184.95s -> 5190.09s]  I just hope that you enjoyed it, which it seems like a lot of people did, which is that makes me
[5190.09s -> 5195.88s]  feel good because that means that people liked the show because that's really all I care about
[5195.88s -> 5202.57s]  at the end of the day is, did people enjoy what I did? I hope they do. That goes through my mind
[5202.57s -> 5207.78s]  every single time. Whenever I'm sitting there, and I told you this before the baseball show too,
[5208.34s -> 5211.62s]  when the first strike call came in, I was like, I fucking hope this is fun. I really do.
[5211.62s -> 5216.89s]  Hope the Christmas stream is really fun too, which I think it would be. So for those of you
[5216.89s -> 5220.57s]  that didn't, there was a lot of people that they were making leave because they were like,
[5220.57s -> 5226.02s]  everyone's got to go, everyone's got to go. I appreciate it. Hopefully I could wave to some
[5226.02s -> 5232.20s]  of you. There were hundreds and hundreds of people there in the audience. So I don't know,
[5232.20s -> 5237.98s]  I think there was a few thousand because of the seats. So thanks for showing up. Ludwig obviously
[5237.98s -> 5245.14s]  appreciates it. He put on an unbelievable hell of an event. And then obviously JK Productions,
[5245.14s -> 5257.78s]  which, hey, look at that. Community Jake. It's really just cool to see that just shit that me
[5257.78s -> 5266.65s]  and Jake five years ago doing the carnival shit and fucking around and look at the space now.
[5266.65s -> 5271.99s]  Look at what Jake is doing now. He's done so many cool fucking things with so many awesome streamers
[5271.99s -> 5277.22s]  and not just Jake, not just Jake's company, the other companies too. There's other production
[5277.22s -> 5283.67s]  companies that are coming up here and doing all kinds of awesome stuff. It's awesome. I love to
[5283.67s -> 5293.67s]  see it and I am happy to participate. Seriously. And you'll see this weekend some other fun stuff.
[5296.47s -> 5301.42s]  Okay. All right. I said, there you go. There's like in a nutshell, it was an unbelievable
[5301.42s -> 5319.85s]  experience. I'll never forget it. Okay. I'll see you on Saturday. Saturday, 4 PM. Can I get a quick
[5319.85s -> 5333.08s]  let's go before I go? Before I go. All right. There you go. I don't think I'm really going to
[5333.08s -> 5338.25s]  do an outro. Actually, why not? We're here. Thanks for sticking around. This is a quick one
[5339.05s -> 5353.29s]  before we do the big holiday stream. 4 PM Pacific time. There'll be a tweet too. You'll see it. I
[5353.29s -> 5376.23s]  think people are going to like the image that goes with it. Stop demanding stuff from us.
[5376.23s -> 5381.26s]  And then I will say, cause I don't know if I'll have time to say it at the end of that stream,
[5381.34s -> 5384.86s]  but after the Christmas stream, after the big holiday extravaganza,
[5387.40s -> 5393.70s]  I will be taking a break for the holidays. So you'll see me again into the new year.
[5396.04s -> 5404.89s]  There will probably be an opportunity at some point the week after before Christmas time for
[5404.89s -> 5412.49s]  me to do a couple of streams possibly. So we'll see. We'll come back in the new year if not,
[5412.49s -> 5420.66s]  but I imagine there'll be another couple of streams before the end of the year.
[5420.66s -> 5432.47s]  Holiday break Andy. Will you please play God of War Ragnarok?
[5432.47s -> 5452.78s]  Um, I don't know. Maybe, but I, I, let me end on this. Uh, stuff like the chest boxing thing
[5452.78s -> 5459.48s]  makes me realize a lot of times that I'm in a position that's incredibly fortunate and
[5459.48s -> 5467.74s]  sometimes a little overwhelming. And I'm just, I just really hope that you guys can continue
[5467.74s -> 5472.66s]  to have fun here. That's all I care about. And sometimes it can be a little overwhelming, but
[5475.70s -> 5479.14s]  thanks for being here and thanks for watching. Thanks for being around as long as a lot of you
[5479.14s -> 5488.70s]  have. Um, I, that's pretty much, I, it's hard for me to kind of put into words some of this stuff,
[5488.70s -> 5496.18s]  but especially after that event, it was just like, holy shit, that was fun. And that was cool.
[5496.18s -> 5504.41s]  But it makes me think a lot like that to be in that spot, to actually be able to do that.
[5504.41s -> 5509.34s]  I'm very lucky. I have a lot of fucking people over the course of my life here that have supported
[5509.34s -> 5515.14s]  me and a lot of other streamers that have shown a lot of support and a lot of everybody here too.
[5515.14s -> 5521.91s]  And I just, I just don't know what to say besides thank you. It's, it's been a, it's been a ride.
[5521.91s -> 5533.00s]  Um, and I don't know how to put it into words besides that. So I appreciate it.
[5533.00s -> 5548.07s]  I'll see you guys on Saturday. Goodbye. See you soon. Saturday at 4 p.m. Pacific.
[5548.07s -> 5564.49s]  All right. Bye. Yeah. And call your mother.
