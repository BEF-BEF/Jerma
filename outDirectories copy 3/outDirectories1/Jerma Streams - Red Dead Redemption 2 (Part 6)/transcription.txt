[2.30s -> 18.52s]  All right, so let me... yeah, we can hop in Red Dead. We'll jump in Red Dead for like an hour or two,
[18.52s -> 20.87s]  so I can kind of prepare myself for tomorrow.
[24.09s -> 35.80s]  Tomorrow being the multiplayer that I'm going to try. It seems any fun. Red Dead 2
[43.70s -> 47.54s]  incoming. What do you mean incoming? Red Dead 2, here it comes! Red Ted 2, Red Ted...
[48.50s -> 64.14s]  Red... why can I not say words? I need to like eat something. Holy shit. If you stuck around
[64.14s -> 72.66s]  just for... I was gonna say insane aquarium. For... I really do need to like eat something,
[72.66s -> 78.90s]  holy shit. I'm like floating by right now for some reason. If you're there for Zoo Tycoon 2,
[79.46s -> 85.19s]  thanks for coming out. Hopefully you stop by tomorrow when we play Red Dead online.
[86.92s -> 90.04s]  I'll see you soon. If not, when... I'll see you whenever you come back.
[93.00s -> 99.83s]  Make the entire map of Red Dead 2 in Zoo Tycoon. Well that is... that is just... that just ain't
[99.83s -> 108.22s]  gonna happen. Let me boot up my PlayStation 4 here. Shouldn't take me more than a minute
[108.22s -> 124.26s]  or so to get this ready. Red Dead Redemption. Jesus, what a lazy guy.
[125.22s -> 130.36s]  Do you know how long it takes to do stuff like that? It would take me like a year to do
[130.36s -> 148.14s]  that. Let me get this going. Yeah, we'll go... we'll try to get like another couple story missions
[148.14s -> 169.19s]  done just so I can kind of familiarize myself with it again. Am I gonna do any conventions
[169.19s -> 185.16s]  this year? Oh, no. Not for the... you mean 2019? Yeah, but I'm... what? What is this?
[185.16s -> 191.21s]  Why is this here? What's this for? I just turned on the PlayStation and this is what was
[191.29s -> 209.98s]  here. I don't know why. Is this the last thing that you saw from two nights ago? Play it.
[220.10s -> 248.82s]  I just put it on Red Dead. One more match. Just make Red Dead characters.
[248.82s -> 274.22s]  That's gonna take me like seven hours. I kind of want to... no, I'm not gonna make
[274.22s -> 289.14s]  Red Dead characters. I'm gonna press the wrong button. No, no, no. It's gonna take... wait,
[289.14s -> 294.79s]  like, I... let's play... we're gonna play Red Dead. Don't worry. You'll see this again sooner
[294.79s -> 305.86s]  than you did the last time. One match. Maybe I might... okay, we'll end on one match. How's that
[305.86s -> 327.22s]  sound? I do want to get some Red Dead in though. Yeah. We'll do that. Okay. Because
[327.22s -> 338.49s]  that's gonna take me to make characters now that's up here. Organize community rumbles.
[339.51s -> 346.60s]  Um, the reason why I don't really do them that often is because it kind of loses its...
[347.32s -> 355.74s]  the reason why it's so special to me and to the community in general is because I put a
[355.74s -> 360.30s]  shitload of time into making a ton of characters and the kinds of... there needs to be enough...
[361.18s -> 375.46s]  Can I just play it now? No. There needs to be enough time as to pass for there to be new
[375.46s -> 381.46s]  characters to make. Because sure, I could just make a bunch of people from before, from older
[381.46s -> 389.16s]  games and throw them in or older rumbles, but I like the idea of each one having a
[389.80s -> 395.00s]  significant amount of people that were, you know, new ideas, new characters, new interesting
[395.00s -> 410.20s]  things over the course of six to 12 months. And eventually transitioning away from the video
[410.20s -> 417.59s]  game. Because as a lot of you guys know, I desperately want to make another live one,
[417.59s -> 426.18s]  and but this time actually do it live. I've hinted at it, talked about it a little bit.
[432.95s -> 437.11s]  Like do a live rumble, like for real, like an actual live German Rumble 2 live
[438.15s -> 454.92s]  stream. Live CGI rumble? No, it would be... the resources that are available
[455.64s -> 459.32s]  on this side of the country, it wouldn't be that hard of a thing to do.
[463.67s -> 468.49s]  All right, what was the last thing I did? I don't know if it's been so long.
[469.21s -> 480.38s]  Who's gonna be on the... he's gonna be at that rumble? I mean that's... I'm not gonna...
[480.38s -> 482.78s]  why would I tell you that? I can't like tell you all the secrets,
[482.78s -> 484.46s]  you keep on... am I gonna tell you every single secret?
[485.18s -> 491.99s]  All right, let's open up the map and see where the hell we are. So I gotta go...
[495.19s -> 501.80s]  here's Micah, which I've not done. Still have not completed that mission,
[501.80s -> 506.44s]  and I don't think I'm gonna. This is where we left off.
[507.08s -> 515.69s]  Oh, should I just do it? No, I don't want to do that.
[516.94s -> 525.13s]  Let's go... is there stagecoach over here? Trapper post office stagecoach.
[525.69s -> 530.02s]  Let's ride the stagecoach, Bill. Yeah, this is single player.
[530.02s -> 532.74s]  I don't have access to the multiplayer until tomorrow,
[534.28s -> 542.90s]  so I just wanted to familiarize myself with the game again,
[543.70s -> 548.78s]  because then tomorrow I'm gonna stream the multiplayer.
[552.94s -> 556.52s]  Is it familiar yet? You could say that, yeah.
[557.16s -> 567.85s]  It only took 10 seconds to get there, so now we could go across this way.
[568.87s -> 572.55s]  My horse is in desperate need of yummy cakes.
[579.85s -> 585.86s]  All right, let's go. The story gets real good, it's worth finishing.
[585.86s -> 592.39s]  Yeah, that's what I've heard. I think when we stopped that was 40-50% of the way done.
[593.27s -> 604.47s]  Is that just about the 40% mark? You gonna finish LA?
[604.47s -> 612.01s]  Nah, I'm not gonna finish LA Noir. We talked about LA Noir, but it's not.
[613.05s -> 618.79s]  LA Noir is a really, really great game, but I could...
[627.40s -> 631.13s]  Did I do that? I didn't do that, did I? I didn't do anything.
[631.77s -> 638.25s]  What did I do? I didn't do anything. Do you want to overwrite the data?
[638.25s -> 653.43s]  I guess. Is that horse better than this horse?
[655.75s -> 675.64s]  Wait, what? Well, this is a good horse, apparently.
[677.29s -> 682.33s]  I mean, that is... It's not stealing if the guy's dead.
[684.54s -> 689.62s]  In the Wild West, that is. You gonna let me on?
[695.62s -> 701.88s]  Yeah, this is gonna work. It's also a murderer, where the horse is a murderer.
[705.96s -> 708.54s]  I'm not a murderer. Not yet, at least. Not now.
[709.26s -> 713.83s]  You're gonna let me... Okay.
[715.77s -> 717.61s]  I kind of need to take this horse somewhere, though, don't I?
[723.46s -> 727.11s]  Follow me. Is there a stable here?
[727.83s -> 736.01s]  Because if there is, then I could at least stable this one.
[742.20s -> 749.26s]  Hey there, mister. Can you only have four?
[749.26s -> 753.02s]  I think you can only have three or four horses here. Something like that.
[760.57s -> 765.99s]  This thing is fast. All right, cool.
[765.99s -> 767.91s]  Uh, how much money do I have? Because I can pay my bounty.
[768.71s -> 776.23s]  But is there a stable? What did I just do?
[779.24s -> 782.79s]  What did I do? Oh, I ran a guy over!
[782.79s -> 785.59s]  I ran that guy over! What?
[789.94s -> 793.38s]  Oh, come on. No, no! Get away from me!
[794.10s -> 798.22s]  I forgot how to fucking melee fight.
[799.10s -> 814.97s]  Don't always check your blind spots. I just slid into that dude.
[815.61s -> 832.65s]  He slid into that guy's DMs.
[834.01s -> 838.54s]  I'm gonna pay the bounty.
[845.21s -> 847.93s]  I don't even know what happened. That guy was like a squirrel.
[850.06s -> 852.54s]  I road killed a guy and I didn't even know he was there.
[852.54s -> 860.41s]  Was he sleeping on the ground? Look at that.
[860.41s -> 866.70s]  That's what every criminal says.
[867.34s -> 871.66s]  Well, I'm not a criminal. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[872.38s -> 874.26s]  I wasn't even going that fast either.
[875.06s -> 883.35s]  All right, here we go. I'm gonna go pay the bounty.
[883.35s -> 887.27s]  I'm gonna go take care of everything. Go to the story mission.
[889.98s -> 898.41s]  Cool. Would you like you to stable this horse?
[900.09s -> 901.21s]  There we go. All right, I gotta name it.
[901.21s -> 904.89s]  So I got horsebag sonic, whisper thunder, and then...
[906.09s -> 911.72s]  Actually, this horse is way better. This horse is fucking 10 times better.
[912.98s -> 921.99s]  All right. Who am I taking out?
[921.99s -> 926.26s]  This is... No, actually, I want to...
[926.26s -> 927.06s]  Give me a whisper.
[927.86s -> 932.42s]  Wow. Name him skateboard. For what?
[933.14s -> 939.51s]  Is that a lot?
[939.51s -> 944.41s]  All right, let's do services.
[945.53s -> 946.57s]  Horse care package.
[950.54s -> 952.94s]  Name him something. Epic gamer. What do I mean?
[954.62s -> 957.21s]  All right, let's pay the bounty. Take the stagecoach.
[959.64s -> 963.00s]  And to get the absolute hell out of here.
[963.72s -> 975.08s]  How many bits do you have to spend to name him skateboard?
[976.04s -> 977.96s]  Get out of my fucking way.
[978.94s -> 980.46s]  Everyone just gets in my way.
[986.55s -> 988.23s]  No, I'm about...
[988.23s -> 990.87s]  How do I say please take me and take me to the jail?
[994.28s -> 996.20s]  Where's the please take me to jail?
[996.20s -> 1004.12s]  That guy just spun around in a circle on the bridge.
[1004.12s -> 1007.16s]  Look, I'm here. I'm ready to take everything.
[1007.16s -> 1008.52s]  I'll be held accountable for all of it.
[1033.72s -> 1038.34s]  Did I just die? What?
[1042.28s -> 1044.60s]  No, okay. I was gonna say how the fuck.
[1049.40s -> 1051.40s]  I thought he instantly killed me.
[1051.96s -> 1063.61s]  So did I pay? You don't lose anything by going to jail, do you?
[1064.49s -> 1075.61s]  Does that not include my bounty? Did my bounty paid?
[1085.34s -> 1086.62s]  My guns are gone or not?
[1092.66s -> 1094.90s]  No, I'm good. I got all my weapons.
[1095.62s -> 1099.06s]  Springfield rifle. Bolt action rifle.
[1101.03s -> 1103.03s]  Yeah, please don't scare me like that.
[1105.99s -> 1107.19s]  If I run another person over.
[1109.24s -> 1110.84s]  All right, I need to go to the stagecoach.
[1116.42s -> 1117.94s]  Stagecoach, let's go.
[1118.66s -> 1123.61s]  And then I need to go from here to here.
[1123.61s -> 1124.81s]  So we gotta go to Rhodes.
[1126.17s -> 1126.89s]  Rhodes Ranch.
[1127.61s -> 1136.78s]  I probably could... I need to turn it up a little bit.
[1137.58s -> 1138.22s]  There we are.
[1138.78s -> 1140.58s]  That probably sounds a little better.
[1158.98s -> 1164.33s]  So don't steal it.
[1177.21s -> 1179.93s]  I haven't played the game in like almost two weeks.
[1180.97s -> 1183.77s]  So I'm sorry. I like bumped into a guy.
[1183.77s -> 1184.97s]  I bumped into another guy.
[1185.85s -> 1197.19s]  For the love of God, just go there yourself.
[1197.75s -> 1198.97s]  Where's the fence?
[1199.61s -> 1205.66s]  He's up here.
[1205.66s -> 1209.51s]  Is there another wagon fence?
[1210.60s -> 1211.64s]  This is so far away.
[1212.28s -> 1219.27s]  This is so fucking far away.
[1225.45s -> 1228.22s]  You just spend the whole time breaking laws.
[1229.02s -> 1234.79s]  I need to wait till this is gone.
[1235.59s -> 1243.18s]  What the hell was that?
[1244.06s -> 1244.70s]  Coyotes?
[1245.34s -> 1246.30s]  Going after a rabbit?
[1249.24s -> 1250.44s]  Yeah, that is what it is.
[1257.03s -> 1258.55s]  No, what if I bring this back?
[1259.82s -> 1261.74s]  I'm gonna bring this back to the guy that I just took it from.
[1275.62s -> 1276.42s]  I found it.
[1276.42s -> 1277.46s]  Look, it's right here.
[1287.05s -> 1290.49s]  I just wanted to say good morning.
[1291.05s -> 1298.22s]  All right.
[1298.22s -> 1301.50s]  Your stagecoach is back.
[1302.06s -> 1307.11s]  Let's go ahead and take a ride.
[1307.67s -> 1308.31s]  Rhodes Ranch.
[1312.33s -> 1317.96s]  See, where's the...
[1317.96s -> 1319.72s]  I crashed into a tree joke.
[1319.72s -> 1320.60s]  There... I didn't...
[1320.60s -> 1322.20s]  There is no crash into tree joke.
[1322.20s -> 1323.40s]  I already fell down a cliff.
[1330.84s -> 1337.61s]  Does that count?
[1337.61s -> 1338.17s]  I'm not sure.
[1338.81s -> 1351.46s]  All right, let's do it.
[1352.02s -> 1352.82s]  Time for a mission.
[1353.70s -> 1355.38s]  It only took us 25 minutes.
[1355.94s -> 1357.22s]  A little less than that.
[1357.22s -> 1358.02s]  Not very much.
[1359.54s -> 1363.56s]  Talk to Bill.
[1363.56s -> 1367.67s]  Come on, that's classic.
[1368.95s -> 1370.47s]  I didn't do it this time.
[1370.47s -> 1371.11s]  The horse did.
[1375.02s -> 1377.02s]  Cartoon Jerma crashes into a tree.
[1386.79s -> 1388.63s]  Well, it's a really good thing somebody said that.
[1393.10s -> 1394.70s]  Thank you for saying that because
[1399.40s -> 1401.56s]  my microphone was not correctly synced up.
[1403.27s -> 1403.75s]  Now it is.
[1404.39s -> 1406.70s]  It was almost a full millisecond behind.
[1407.26s -> 1410.57s]  Or ahead, actually.
[1414.65s -> 1415.37s]  How's it now? Let's see.
[1416.26s -> 1418.26s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[1418.26s -> 1420.74s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[1420.74s -> 1421.38s]  Should be good.
[1435.75s -> 1436.95s]  What is that guy?
[1443.21s -> 1444.49s]  I couldn't watch with the delay.
[1444.49s -> 1445.21s]  I'm so sorry.
[1445.21s -> 1445.85s]  I didn't realize it.
[1445.85s -> 1447.93s]  We just came from a PC game, so...
[1449.30s -> 1452.42s]  For my capture card, it's a 650 millisecond delay.
[1453.77s -> 1455.29s]  So I have to offset the mic, so...
[1455.29s -> 1455.85s]  Sorry about that.
[1467.75s -> 1468.31s]  Hey, Bill!
[1475.10s -> 1476.14s]  What can I do for you?
[1476.14s -> 1478.54s]  What is it?
[1478.54s -> 1479.90s]  We got something cooking.
[1479.90s -> 1481.26s]  You might be interested in.
[1481.26s -> 1483.26s]  Am I gonna like the sound of this?
[1483.26s -> 1485.02s]  Been cooking since Horseshoe.
[1485.02s -> 1488.14s]  But you went and kicked up all that commotion in Valentine.
[1488.14s -> 1490.06s]  Now we was preparing to rob the bank there
[1490.06s -> 1493.34s]  until you got involved in all that nonsense and...
[1493.34s -> 1493.82s]  I don't know.
[1493.82s -> 1495.90s]  I just feel like it's unfinished business.
[1495.90s -> 1497.18s]  That wasn't my fault.
[1497.18s -> 1498.94s]  It was just one of them things.
[1498.94s -> 1501.26s]  How come every time I get in trouble,
[1501.26s -> 1503.18s]  I'm called a fool and an idiot?
[1503.18s -> 1504.54s]  But when you get in trouble,
[1504.54s -> 1506.78s]  oh, it's just one of them things.
[1506.78s -> 1507.90s]  It's a good point, Arthur.
[1508.46s -> 1509.42s]  A very good point.
[1510.38s -> 1513.35s]  Well, what do y'all want me to do?
[1513.35s -> 1515.11s]  Hit the goddamn bank with us.
[1515.11s -> 1516.07s]  I love my Nerf bullet.
[1516.71s -> 1517.99s]  My backup Nerf bullets.
[1517.99s -> 1520.63s]  You really think it's worth going back there?
[1520.63s -> 1522.39s]  Four of us can hit the bank easy.
[1522.39s -> 1523.83s]  Did I make that joke two weeks ago?
[1523.83s -> 1524.39s]  I might have.
[1524.39s -> 1525.19s]  We linger.
[1526.07s -> 1527.35s]  Did I say that two weeks ago?
[1527.35s -> 1529.91s]  Just local boys get rounded up and pressed into action.
[1529.91s -> 1530.87s]  Two weeks ago.
[1530.87s -> 1532.63s]  If we go in quick and quiet,
[1532.63s -> 1534.23s]  we can hit it just fine.
[1534.23s -> 1535.91s]  If there's four of us, I mean.
[1536.95s -> 1538.87s]  Y'all think it's worth the risk.
[1538.87s -> 1540.79s]  It's a bank, Arthur.
[1540.79s -> 1545.43s]  So is the take good, according to the fella I met?
[1545.43s -> 1546.07s]  Yes.
[1546.07s -> 1547.83s]  It's the end of the stock sales.
[1547.83s -> 1550.39s]  Plenty of money and plenty of people milling about.
[1551.67s -> 1557.59s]  OK, I suppose we're taking a look at least.
[1557.59s -> 1558.55s]  I'm going to be performing.
[1558.55s -> 1560.79s]  I better go get old material as usual.
[1561.75s -> 1565.43s]  OK, so Bill, this better be good.
[1565.43s -> 1566.63s]  It is good.
[1566.63s -> 1568.63s]  We put a lot of research into this one.
[1568.63s -> 1573.21s]  I hope so, Mr. Morgan.
[1574.09s -> 1574.81s]  Her stress?
[1574.81s -> 1575.61s]  That man.
[1575.61s -> 1576.41s]  The daughter?
[1576.41s -> 1577.13s]  Thomas Downs?
[1577.13s -> 1578.49s]  Apparently, he's dead.
[1578.49s -> 1579.13s]  Dead?
[1579.13s -> 1580.01s]  Remember my clothes.
[1580.01s -> 1581.13s]  Oh, he didn't seem very well.
[1581.13s -> 1582.01s]  His wife.
[1582.01s -> 1583.53s]  I believe he has a wife and child.
[1583.53s -> 1584.01s]  We all change?
[1584.01s -> 1585.61s]  She will assume the debt, of course.
[1585.61s -> 1586.49s]  Of course.
[1586.49s -> 1588.57s]  Then you can head up there and collect.
[1588.57s -> 1589.93s]  We lent them a lot of money.
[1589.93s -> 1590.49s]  OK.
[1590.49s -> 1593.05s]  Gentlemen, let's go rob ourselves a bank.
[1593.05s -> 1594.17s]  What's the plan there?
[1594.17s -> 1595.05s]  I remember my clothes.
[1595.05s -> 1598.17s]  We're going to send Karen on in ahead as a distraction.
[1598.17s -> 1600.33s]  Then we're just going to rush on in afterwards.
[1600.33s -> 1602.17s]  Just a small bank in a little town.
[1602.25s -> 1603.93s]  Nothing that big in way of security.
[1605.05s -> 1608.01s]  We just need to bring you along as an insurance policy.
[1608.73s -> 1610.25s]  He's read the evidential to a sequel.
[1612.49s -> 1615.45s]  It is a prequel.
[1620.36s -> 1621.80s]  You ever see Star Wars the Phantom Menace?
[1622.95s -> 1623.59s]  It's like that.
[1624.15s -> 1628.30s]  There's only one difference though.
[1628.30s -> 1630.06s]  It does not take place in Star Wars.
[1630.06s -> 1634.06s]  Tell me again about this big can't go wrong family horse.
[1634.06s -> 1636.46s]  Oh, it can go wrong.
[1636.46s -> 1637.82s]  Anything can.
[1637.90s -> 1639.26s]  Once the shooting starts.
[1640.06s -> 1642.22s]  Well, that's reassuring.
[1643.66s -> 1647.34s]  Like I said, we'll see how it looks.
[1647.34s -> 1652.38s]  If we can get in all right, we'll send this Jones into the bank.
[1652.38s -> 1652.78s]  Yep.
[1652.78s -> 1654.46s]  They won't recognize her.
[1655.18s -> 1657.18s]  I'll show you boys how it's done.
[1657.90s -> 1659.34s]  What are you thinking this time?
[1659.98s -> 1660.62s]  I don't know.
[1660.62s -> 1661.42s]  That wasn't even my fault.
[1661.42s -> 1663.66s]  Fellers always like a lost little girl.
[1663.66s -> 1666.06s]  But nobody plays a drunken harlot boy like me.
[1666.78s -> 1668.78s]  It should work.
[1668.78s -> 1671.66s]  Once he's got them distracted, we'll move in.
[1672.62s -> 1674.86s]  When I was scouting the place the other day.
[1674.86s -> 1676.54s]  There was only a couple of guards.
[1677.42s -> 1682.46s]  We deal with them and any customers who are feeling brave.
[1682.46s -> 1685.74s]  And you always fancy yourself as the Bolt Man, right Arthur?
[1685.74s -> 1686.54s]  It was inconsiderate.
[1686.54s -> 1687.02s]  It was rude.
[1687.02s -> 1688.38s]  I see why you brought me.
[1688.38s -> 1689.18s]  It was untrue.
[1689.18s -> 1691.26s]  Hey, I'm more than willing.
[1691.26s -> 1692.14s]  It was very rude.
[1693.42s -> 1694.38s]  Best I do it.
[1694.94s -> 1699.58s]  Oh, and did Doug tell you I've also been cooking up some deals with them gray boys?
[1700.46s -> 1701.10s]  What?
[1701.10s -> 1701.58s]  No.
[1701.58s -> 1702.30s]  Banned that guy.
[1702.30s -> 1707.10s]  Nobody gets banned for making a reference to Star Wars.
[1707.10s -> 1709.34s]  I'm out there putting in the work same as you.
[1710.06s -> 1712.38s]  I've been drinking with them a couple of times now.
[1712.38s -> 1713.58s]  Let's turn and run me off the road.
[1713.58s -> 1716.22s]  It seems you're looking for some extra security.
[1716.22s -> 1718.54s]  Yeah, I'm sure they are.
[1718.54s -> 1720.06s]  Could be something in it for us.
[1720.70s -> 1723.66s]  Well, just be smart about it.
[1723.82s -> 1725.90s]  Got a lot of irons in that fire right now.
[1725.90s -> 1726.94s]  You mean Star Trek?
[1726.94s -> 1727.42s]  Yes.
[1727.42s -> 1728.46s]  I know, Morgan.
[1730.68s -> 1731.48s]  Well, Star Trek.
[1735.14s -> 1739.22s]  Can't believe if you got me going back to Valentine.
[1739.22s -> 1742.02s]  Don't tell me it ain't hurt you leaving that bank behind.
[1742.02s -> 1743.06s]  What do I think about sand?
[1743.06s -> 1743.70s]  Not really.
[1743.70s -> 1745.62s]  Work in town and not hit the bank?
[1745.62s -> 1746.66s]  The desert?
[1746.66s -> 1747.06s]  The beach?
[1747.06s -> 1748.10s]  That's counter empathetic.
[1749.06s -> 1752.26s]  I guess we went a bit beyond working it.
[1752.26s -> 1754.10s]  We shot the place to hell.
[1754.74s -> 1755.94s]  You did, Morgan.
[1756.42s -> 1757.06s]  Not me.
[1757.86s -> 1759.30s]  I played it cool up there.
[1759.86s -> 1761.06s]  A couple of punch-ups.
[1761.62s -> 1763.54s]  Dealt with some old Driscolls.
[1763.54s -> 1766.26s]  What do I think about sands from Undertale?
[1766.26s -> 1768.74s]  Like I said, you mess up.
[1768.74s -> 1770.50s]  It's just one of them things.
[1771.14s -> 1774.98s]  I mean, it's a character in the game.
[1774.98s -> 1779.34s]  Well, Bill, I don't know what to tell you.
[1779.98s -> 1781.98s]  Surprised you ain't already ripped me about that dynamite yet.
[1781.98s -> 1783.26s]  This is a pretty great loading screen.
[1783.26s -> 1783.74s]  Yeah, it is.
[1784.30s -> 1785.18s]  One mistake.
[1785.82s -> 1786.86s]  And I'll never live it down.
[1786.86s -> 1787.90s]  That looks really, really cool.
[1787.90s -> 1788.38s]  Look at that.
[1788.38s -> 1789.34s]  What do you think?
[1789.34s -> 1790.22s]  Pet on the back?
[1790.22s -> 1791.10s]  It's beautiful.
[1791.10s -> 1791.98s]  A medal?
[1791.98s -> 1795.34s]  Just know, I got the lead on this one.
[1795.34s -> 1798.86s]  We'll see about that once things get going.
[1800.38s -> 1802.54s]  Not paying attention is a bingo for me.
[1802.54s -> 1803.98s]  So, thinking this through?
[1803.98s -> 1805.02s]  Are you paying attention?
[1805.02s -> 1807.02s]  You rob Cornwall's train?
[1807.66s -> 1810.41s]  Or shoot a heap of his men in Valentine?
[1811.05s -> 1813.13s]  I'm his stage coach.
[1813.13s -> 1815.45s]  This is just dawning on you now.
[1815.45s -> 1820.73s]  And now, we're going back to the one place he knew where to find us.
[1820.73s -> 1822.33s]  That's the genius of it.
[1823.29s -> 1826.01s]  Folk never look at what's right under their nose.
[1826.01s -> 1826.81s]  I know what's going to happen here.
[1826.81s -> 1829.21s]  I ain't sure that's always true.
[1830.01s -> 1831.29s]  What's happened to you?
[1832.17s -> 1834.57s]  You're getting real nervy in your old age.
[1835.21s -> 1836.81s]  Last few weeks happened.
[1837.53s -> 1839.53s]  Forget about Cornwall.
[1839.53s -> 1840.09s]  Forget about Bill.
[1840.09s -> 1842.49s]  He can't have many men left at this point.
[1843.37s -> 1845.21s]  Got a bit hairy in that barn.
[1845.69s -> 1848.25s]  But we all walked away fine from that.
[1848.25s -> 1850.65s]  You don't walk away much.
[1850.65s -> 1854.09s]  If four of us could deal with them in Valentine.
[1854.09s -> 1857.53s]  And four of us could deal with them after the coach robbery.
[1857.53s -> 1858.89s]  I ain't too worried.
[1860.01s -> 1861.05s]  If you say so.
[1862.41s -> 1863.61s]  Quit messing with the cord.
[1871.58s -> 1873.42s]  Running into a rough patch here for some reason.
[1881.53s -> 1882.89s]  Don't celebrate too early.
[1882.89s -> 1883.77s]  Yeah, I don't really.
[1884.81s -> 1900.38s]  This music is very appropriate for the tension.
[1901.34s -> 1912.47s]  Maybe if your camera was off it would work a little more smoothly.
[1912.47s -> 1913.35s]  I don't have my camera.
[1913.35s -> 1914.23s]  What do you mean camera?
[1915.35s -> 1922.34s]  Up the contrast a little bit.
[1923.96s -> 1929.19s]  I don't think the stream is going to die.
[1929.99s -> 1932.87s]  I think we may have just hit a little bit of a rough patch.
[1933.67s -> 1953.27s]  Famous, famous last words.
[1954.07s -> 1965.94s]  How come they're not talking anymore?
[1973.48s -> 1974.68s]  Next frame please.
[1983.62s -> 1985.38s]  Gentlemen, here we are.
[1986.10s -> 1988.42s]  Okay, get ready.
[1992.65s -> 1993.45s]  All right, you ready?
[1994.09s -> 1994.65s]  Let's do it.
[1995.45s -> 1996.09s]  I am prepared.
[1997.90s -> 2000.12s]  Okay, go to work.
[2000.12s -> 2000.62s]  Of course.
[2004.38s -> 2006.94s]  All right, keep it cool and follow me, fellas.
[2008.28s -> 2009.56s]  Powerpoint Red Dead.
[2014.42s -> 2020.38s]  Oh, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[2020.38s -> 2021.42s]  We never decided.
[2022.30s -> 2029.11s]  Is it lost little girl you want or the drunk in Harlem?
[2029.19s -> 2032.14s]  I think the drunk in Harlem.
[2032.14s -> 2034.22s]  Of course, you know I like the Harlem.
[2034.22s -> 2037.40s]  You're the only one.
[2037.40s -> 2038.92s]  No, it must have been the green screen man.
[2038.92s -> 2041.88s]  You're a bunch of filthy sinners and the heartbreakers.
[2043.32s -> 2044.52s]  Now where is he?
[2045.64s -> 2046.60s]  That's pretty good.
[2046.60s -> 2047.88s]  He's pretty good.
[2047.88s -> 2048.84s]  Good luck, gentlemen.
[2049.40s -> 2050.28s]  We got this.
[2052.15s -> 2054.07s]  I've never seen anyone not pick the Harlem.
[2055.43s -> 2055.83s]  I know.
[2056.98s -> 2059.86s]  I'm 100% certain that every stream you've ever seen do this.
[2061.06s -> 2062.34s]  It was okay.
[2062.34s -> 2063.14s]  We're going.
[2063.14s -> 2065.30s]  Huh, hold on.
[2065.30s -> 2066.98s]  Wait till she's gone real dead.
[2066.98s -> 2067.70s]  Until he lands.
[2070.42s -> 2070.92s]  Okay.
[2076.65s -> 2077.85s]  Am I ready to burst through here?
[2080.97s -> 2081.53s]  There we go.
[2082.73s -> 2084.81s]  Nobody move.
[2086.87s -> 2087.51s]  Get on the ground.
[2087.51s -> 2088.01s]  Good.
[2090.71s -> 2091.51s]  Nice toss.
[2092.07s -> 2092.57s]  Elizabeth.
[2093.67s -> 2094.17s]  Ammo.
[2102.06s -> 2105.99s]  Open that vault right now.
[2114.52s -> 2115.02s]  Open it.
[2121.50s -> 2122.38s]  Is he pretending?
[2135.77s -> 2137.85s]  I'm just fucking with his concentration.
[2137.85s -> 2139.45s]  I'm making him start over again.
[2141.62s -> 2143.93s]  He's got it, right?
[2150.39s -> 2151.27s]  Open the safe.
[2154.31s -> 2155.67s]  Am I actually resetting him?
[2156.15s -> 2160.68s]  That was...
[2160.68s -> 2161.32s]  I didn't do that.
[2161.32s -> 2161.82s]  He did.
[2162.88s -> 2163.12s]  All right.
[2163.12s -> 2163.52s]  Here we go.
[2163.52s -> 2164.02s]  I'm in.
[2164.86s -> 2167.98s]  Someone come make sure the chute behaves himself in here.
[2168.62s -> 2169.02s]  What do we need?
[2169.02s -> 2169.58s]  What are we looking for?
[2170.86s -> 2173.10s]  Open the lock boxes now.
[2177.26s -> 2179.26s]  Wait, if he doesn't know, we can't hold this against him.
[2179.26s -> 2182.91s]  This guy's been hitting the head so many times he's gonna forget who he is.
[2182.91s -> 2184.20s]  Crack them or blow them.
[2184.20s -> 2184.92s]  Keep an eye out.
[2184.92s -> 2188.00s]  I'll be as quick as I can.
[2188.00s -> 2188.72s]  Crack?
[2188.72s -> 2189.60s]  Crack the safes.
[2189.60s -> 2191.92s]  Yeah, I think I should be able to crack these.
[2191.92s -> 2192.40s]  Why did I do that?
[2192.40s -> 2193.12s]  I should have blown one.
[2193.12s -> 2194.88s]  But you better be quick.
[2194.88s -> 2196.16s]  I should have blown him up.
[2196.24s -> 2197.04s]  I should have blown the...
[2198.88s -> 2199.52s]  Oh, no.
[2199.52s -> 2200.32s]  I should have blown him up.
[2200.32s -> 2201.12s]  I should have blown him up.
[2232.35s -> 2234.91s]  I almost got one.
[2234.91s -> 2238.46s]  I almost got one.
[2238.46s -> 2239.50s]  I almost have one.
[2240.72s -> 2241.52s]  Okay, I got one.
[2247.32s -> 2248.44s]  Only five more to go.
[2249.56s -> 2250.36s]  That's so much money.
[2250.36s -> 2251.08s]  Okay, hold on.
[2251.08s -> 2252.36s]  I gotta actually pay attention.
[2256.92s -> 2263.52s]  Come on.
[2263.52s -> 2264.88s]  Find it, Arthur.
[2264.88s -> 2268.76s]  That was quick.
[2268.76s -> 2277.55s]  That was three grand.
[2277.55s -> 2278.35s]  How much is in this one?
[2278.35s -> 2279.39s]  Three grand in every one of them?
[2280.91s -> 2281.63s]  Four thousand.
[2281.63s -> 2282.27s]  Holy shit.
[2291.56s -> 2292.04s]  I had it.
[2292.60s -> 2296.44s]  I'm trying to go too fast.
[2306.06s -> 2307.82s]  You motherfucker open.
[2313.40s -> 2314.84s]  Right here, right here, right here, right here, right here.
[2314.84s -> 2315.48s]  Right here.
[2315.48s -> 2315.88s]  Right here.
[2328.03s -> 2328.67s]  Come on.
[2329.87s -> 2331.07s]  I only have two more to get.
[2331.07s -> 2338.83s]  I got the first one quick.
[2340.41s -> 2341.71s]  Here it comes.
[2341.71s -> 2342.03s]  Come on.
[2342.03s -> 2342.43s]  Right here.
[2345.47s -> 2346.75s]  I went through the whole thing.
[2346.75s -> 2347.07s]  Fuck.
[2347.71s -> 2351.21s]  Two.
[2351.21s -> 2351.77s]  Here's three.
[2351.77s -> 2352.01s]  Right here.
[2352.01s -> 2352.49s]  I just had it.
[2352.49s -> 2353.13s]  It was 60.
[2353.85s -> 2354.94s]  Was it 60?
[2355.50s -> 2355.74s]  Yep.
[2356.38s -> 2370.14s]  Blow up the last two.
[2370.70s -> 2371.26s]  No, I got it.
[2371.26s -> 2371.58s]  I got it.
[2371.58s -> 2372.46s]  I got it.
[2372.46s -> 2374.06s]  I don't need to explode anything.
[2374.62s -> 2375.18s]  I just missed it.
[2375.18s -> 2375.66s]  It was right there.
[2376.22s -> 2383.26s]  It's right here.
[2383.90s -> 2384.54s]  Right here.
[2387.58s -> 2388.62s]  It's right here.
[2388.62s -> 2389.74s]  It's right here.
[2389.74s -> 2390.30s]  Got it.
[2390.30s -> 2390.62s]  Told you.
[2391.34s -> 2404.38s]  Got them all.
[2404.38s -> 2405.50s]  That's it, right?
[2405.50s -> 2410.03s]  Is it as simple as it seems?
[2410.91s -> 2411.31s]  Fairly.
[2411.95s -> 2413.84s]  Fairly simple.
[2413.84s -> 2419.07s]  How are we doing on frames?
[2419.63s -> 2421.37s]  Did you kill the bank teller?
[2422.60s -> 2423.48s]  You did.
[2423.48s -> 2428.17s]  You got hit in the head one too many times.
[2428.17s -> 2429.21s]  You didn't have anything on him either.
[2429.85s -> 2434.91s]  I bet you shouldn't have hit him three or four times.
[2446.11s -> 2446.67s]  Frames are good.
[2446.67s -> 2446.83s]  Yeah.
[2446.83s -> 2451.31s]  I think we just ran into a rough patch.
[2451.31s -> 2452.75s]  I don't think it's an actual issue.
[2453.55s -> 2457.07s]  Speaking very, very cautiously on that.
[2457.07s -> 2464.17s]  But are we just calmly walking out of here?
[2464.17s -> 2470.30s]  Someone's robbed the bank.
[2470.30s -> 2471.10s]  All right, we've got to go.
[2475.42s -> 2475.90s]  Lawmen.
[2476.70s -> 2479.79s]  My horse just got shot.
[2480.51s -> 2481.45s]  That's not good.
[2485.44s -> 2486.16s]  Dead or alive.
[2486.16s -> 2486.80s]  Out, out, out.
[2486.80s -> 2487.12s]  Let's go.
[2489.23s -> 2490.43s]  Everybody has to live.
[2490.43s -> 2492.99s]  I'm going to take a different weapon out here.
[2494.19s -> 2497.96s]  Yeah, repeater.
[2499.64s -> 2501.79s]  Maybe I won't need to shoot anybody.
[2502.27s -> 2503.39s]  It might be a good idea to get out of here.
[2504.27s -> 2505.90s]  Pretty swell, actually.
[2505.90s -> 2506.46s]  That's pretty great.
[2507.34s -> 2510.56s]  Maybe I'll have to get out though.
[2510.56s -> 2512.48s]  Because I don't want to go too far ahead of everybody.
[2516.00s -> 2521.64s]  I forgot how to use that on.
[2522.28s -> 2523.16s]  I forgot how it worked.
[2523.88s -> 2525.26s]  I had to hit R1.
[2526.46s -> 2535.23s]  Remember now.
[2535.23s -> 2542.30s]  I can't wait to play this online.
[2542.30s -> 2543.50s]  This is probably something fun.
[2549.21s -> 2550.57s]  Has anybody watched any of the online?
[2551.61s -> 2553.21s]  How does it...
[2553.21s -> 2556.80s]  Is it fun or is it dumb?
[2556.80s -> 2574.41s]  Good shot.
[2575.05s -> 2577.21s]  I hope I can get it.
[2584.59s -> 2586.11s]  It looks okay from what's there now.
[2587.15s -> 2588.19s]  It actually has a story.
[2588.19s -> 2588.67s]  That's cool.
[2589.39s -> 2592.40s]  It still is the beta.
[2592.40s -> 2592.72s]  That's...
[2592.72s -> 2593.44s]  Yeah, that's great.
[2597.60s -> 2599.60s]  Very interested in how it's doing right now.
[2599.60s -> 2603.40s]  Because GTA Online was cool, but...
[2629.07s -> 2629.39s]  Thanks.
[2629.39s -> 2630.27s]  I think we lost him.
[2630.27s -> 2631.55s]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[2632.35s -> 2633.95s]  I'm so glad that didn't happen.
[2633.95s -> 2635.55s]  Because I would have had to do the whole thing over again.
[2638.35s -> 2639.95s]  And I would have been really upset.
[2639.95s -> 2640.51s]  I would have gone...
[2640.51s -> 2641.31s]  What? Oh, no!
[2641.31s -> 2642.51s]  I had to do the whole thing again?
[2642.51s -> 2643.31s]  What the fuck?
[2643.31s -> 2643.79s]  Do you know what?
[2643.79s -> 2644.67s]  I was just messing around.
[2655.63s -> 2656.03s]  Holy shit.
[2656.03s -> 2659.23s]  It's taking this guy two weeks to get through chapter two.
[2660.67s -> 2661.39s]  I haven't played it.
[2662.43s -> 2664.03s]  I haven't really put any time into it.
[2664.03s -> 2665.23s]  I've been too busy with other stuff.
[2666.27s -> 2667.63s]  Too many other things going on.
[2673.05s -> 2674.57s]  Ride to the ranch.
[2674.57s -> 2687.56s]  It's still in Anor Londo, I see.
[2688.60s -> 2690.00s]  God, I miss that game.
[2691.53s -> 2693.13s]  I miss souls.
[2694.17s -> 2698.56s]  I really do.
[2699.28s -> 2704.94s]  Sekiro is going to be so much fun.
[2704.94s -> 2705.74s]  It looks great.
[2706.70s -> 2712.67s]  Have I played Bloodborne before?
[2714.94s -> 2720.22s]  You are referencing probably my favorite single player video game ever made.
[2721.10s -> 2724.35s]  Did somebody say Bloodborne?
[2724.35s -> 2725.95s]  Oh, now you're going to get him started.
[2726.67s -> 2728.28s]  Now he's not going to stop talking about it.
[2729.08s -> 2734.68s]  Here we go.
[2734.68s -> 2736.12s]  Now it starts.
[2736.68s -> 2737.56s]  He's not going to stop.
[2738.52s -> 2743.24s]  Yeah, I have not beaten it on stream.
[2743.88s -> 2744.76s]  That is true.
[2747.39s -> 2750.99s]  But I'm excited for a lot of things, actually.
[2751.79s -> 2756.89s]  Like I told you guys earlier in the stream,
[2759.28s -> 2763.44s]  I want pretty much every other weekend or so,
[2763.44s -> 2764.24s]  or once a month,
[2765.20s -> 2768.33s]  to not only do new games that are coming out,
[2768.33s -> 2771.29s]  but more stuff that you've never seen before.
[2772.01s -> 2772.73s]  From me, at least.
[2773.69s -> 2777.18s]  There's another thing coming up at the end of December.
[2777.18s -> 2778.30s]  That should be a lot of fun.
[2778.94s -> 2780.62s]  Tons of games coming out at the beginning of the year.
[2781.74s -> 2783.02s]  I'm fucking, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[2783.02s -> 2783.58s]  I can't wait.
[2795.82s -> 2797.66s]  Hey, my fault about the way the world is.
[2797.66s -> 2799.02s]  He didn't have a choice.
[2799.02s -> 2800.22s]  You're playing the Lego games?
[2800.22s -> 2801.26s]  He was good and he did good.
[2802.06s -> 2803.34s]  There wasn't no choice in that.
[2804.22s -> 2805.82s]  And you was good as killed him yourself.
[2805.82s -> 2807.58s]  And don't kid yourself.
[2807.58s -> 2808.54s]  You had a choice.
[2808.54s -> 2811.02s]  You speak as if killing were something I cared about.
[2811.02s -> 2812.94s]  You ever wonder about eternity?
[2812.94s -> 2813.42s]  You should.
[2813.42s -> 2815.82s]  I hope it's hot and terrible, Mrs. Downs.
[2815.82s -> 2818.14s]  Otherwise, I'll feel I've been sold a false bill of goods.
[2818.14s -> 2820.70s]  Now, please give me that money.
[2821.26s -> 2822.30s]  Stop hogging the internet.
[2822.38s -> 2827.10s]  Well, we just dropped like two or three thousand frames five minutes ago.
[2827.10s -> 2833.50s]  So I'm not sure why we're having internet issues at the moment.
[2834.46s -> 2837.34s]  Well, maybe when your mother's finished mourning your father,
[2838.22s -> 2840.46s]  I'll keep her in black on your behalf.
[2841.18s -> 2842.62s]  You think on that point.
[2842.62s -> 2844.14s]  Well, maybe you shall, sir.
[2844.14s -> 2845.74s]  And maybe other events will transpire.
[2846.94s -> 2850.46s]  You best stick to them books because mark my words on this.
[2850.46s -> 2852.38s]  Vengeance is an idiot's game.
[2852.38s -> 2855.66s]  Ah, Mrs. Downs, thank you for your punctuality.
[2855.66s -> 2857.18s]  It's next to godliness, isn't it?
[2857.90s -> 2858.54s]  That's clean.
[2858.54s -> 2859.34s]  Lego Island.
[2859.34s -> 2860.78s]  I'll have to take your word on that.
[2862.60s -> 2863.08s]  Good day.
[2867.90s -> 2869.42s]  Yeah, I told you I was going to play Lego Island.
[2869.42s -> 2872.22s]  I was going to build a computer to play Lego Island.
[2875.12s -> 2879.34s]  I got a Raspberry Pi that you can't even install it on there.
[2879.34s -> 2881.66s]  I was going to just build a fucking computer.
[2887.05s -> 2888.01s]  You don't like my Arthur?
[2888.89s -> 2890.92s]  I think I just put random clothes on him.
[2891.40s -> 2915.47s]  Christmas dinner cooking stream.
[2916.99s -> 2918.03s]  Uh, no.
[2921.24s -> 2921.80s]  Ten.
[2921.80s -> 2924.72s]  Did I just get three grand?
[2925.28s -> 2929.72s]  Holy shit.
[2929.72s -> 2931.80s]  The camp just took ten thousand dollars from that.
[2933.05s -> 2936.25s]  I've been donating hundreds of dollars a week to the camp.
[2937.05s -> 2943.04s]  About you playing that zoo game.
[2943.04s -> 2943.60s]  I was.
[2944.76s -> 2946.84s]  And then after like four hours or so, it was.
[2948.64s -> 2950.72s]  We kind of saw the things that we wanted to see.
[2951.68s -> 2956.01s]  So I have to go do Mike and now, don't I?
[2956.01s -> 2957.37s]  I actually have to do this.
[2965.12s -> 2966.16s]  All right, let me see.
[2966.16s -> 2967.92s]  I think I have all the upgrades though, don't I?
[2970.91s -> 2973.23s]  I'm 95% certain that I have the upgrades.
[2974.03s -> 2981.50s]  Everyone's calling my name.
[2981.50s -> 2981.98s]  I'm busy.
[2981.98s -> 2983.02s]  I got places to be, man.
[2986.60s -> 2988.44s]  I'm going to eat some food.
[2995.36s -> 2997.52s]  This is a sexy Santa cosplay.
[3006.06s -> 3006.86s]  I didn't say that.
[3006.86s -> 3007.98s]  Somebody, I didn't say that.
[3007.98s -> 3008.70s]  Somebody said that.
[3008.70s -> 3009.50s]  Somebody else said that.
[3010.14s -> 3012.38s]  I was just responding to somebody in chat.
[3013.18s -> 3020.09s]  How are we all doing?
[3020.09s -> 3021.13s]  No, I don't play dominoes.
[3021.13s -> 3022.17s]  I don't know how to play dominoes.
[3029.72s -> 3033.28s]  So let's do some cleaning here.
[3034.83s -> 3035.87s]  Shave my face.
[3037.58s -> 3037.98s]  Maybe.
[3038.72s -> 3039.68s]  Just a little.
[3039.68s -> 3040.48s]  Maybe just a tad.
[3045.93s -> 3052.24s]  No, no, no.
[3054.73s -> 3055.93s]  Just give him a long chin.
[3064.04s -> 3065.16s]  No, I want to keep the whole thing.
[3066.96s -> 3068.32s]  How do I grow more hair?
[3068.32s -> 3068.88s]  Is there a way?
[3069.76s -> 3077.92s]  Is there a way for me just to have the beard go all the way to 10?
[3080.00s -> 3080.64s]  Hair tonic?
[3080.64s -> 3081.68s]  Just drink hair tonic?
[3082.73s -> 3084.09s]  No, you put hair tonic on.
[3084.09s -> 3085.29s]  You don't consume it.
[3091.61s -> 3092.33s]  Take some ammo.
[3094.24s -> 3096.96s]  You drink, yeah, I drink the tonic.
[3100.62s -> 3102.70s]  It stops you from getting hairy insides.
[3105.53s -> 3107.37s]  I've been doing it so wrong this whole time.
[3112.64s -> 3113.04s]  All right.
[3114.60s -> 3116.68s]  Micah, are you the last mission?
[3116.68s -> 3117.80s]  No, you know what?
[3117.80s -> 3118.68s]  No, fuck Micah.
[3123.58s -> 3127.18s]  Let's go do the other side mission thing.
[3133.42s -> 3141.87s]  Let's do it.
[3145.95s -> 3146.75s]  Let's go do this.
[3147.55s -> 3150.65s]  Where is it on the map here?
[3150.65s -> 3156.86s]  What the hell is it?
[3157.50s -> 3161.07s]  Was it even on the map?
[3161.07s -> 3161.71s]  Maybe it wasn't.
[3162.51s -> 3163.71s]  And I can donate this.
[3164.99s -> 3169.48s]  I thought I had another mission to do.
[3169.48s -> 3169.96s]  I guess not.
[3177.32s -> 3177.88s]  I'll do it.
[3180.92s -> 3182.12s]  How long is the stream going to be?
[3182.12s -> 3183.16s]  Uh, maybe like another...
[3184.20s -> 3186.36s]  I'll do like one more mission and then we'll probably call it a night.
[3188.60s -> 3191.00s]  I'm going to start fairly early, I think, tomorrow.
[3193.00s -> 3198.73s]  Because I want to get started with the online.
[3203.69s -> 3205.05s]  WWE, yeah, we'll do one match.
[3205.85s -> 3212.44s]  We'll do one match.
[3213.98s -> 3215.02s]  Dad lied to us.
[3215.02s -> 3216.22s]  No, I told you I'm going to do one.
[3216.22s -> 3216.94s]  I'll do one match.
[3221.98s -> 3222.54s]  Upgrade?
[3222.54s -> 3224.14s]  I have all the upgrades already.
[3224.94s -> 3226.08s]  Unless they changed.
[3226.64s -> 3232.91s]  Let me take a look.
[3238.33s -> 3239.85s]  Make Arthur Morgan in WWE.
[3246.81s -> 3248.81s]  Yeah, I usually kill old dress schools too.
[3254.09s -> 3256.17s]  We ain't in the revenge business.
[3256.17s -> 3257.53s]  It don't keep you fed.
[3258.97s -> 3259.93s]  Just watch me.
[3260.73s -> 3262.41s]  Buy the mech suit upgrade.
[3269.55s -> 3270.99s]  $32 returned.
[3271.71s -> 3273.20s]  All right, let's take a look at the ledger.
[3273.20s -> 3274.24s]  I don't know if I...
[3275.04s -> 3283.18s]  Yeah, I can restock.
[3283.18s -> 3284.62s]  I'll restock.
[3287.84s -> 3288.32s]  Why not?
[3290.56s -> 3292.32s]  Uh, bought everything else.
[3296.40s -> 3296.96s]  Buy that.
[3298.51s -> 3298.99s]  Buy that.
[3301.55s -> 3302.43s]  I bought everything else.
[3303.39s -> 3304.35s]  I have the boat too.
[3305.15s -> 3309.90s]  I really needed that, didn't I?
[3316.04s -> 3317.00s]  Upgrade everything?
[3317.00s -> 3317.56s]  I already did.
[3318.28s -> 3320.14s]  Did you buy fast travel?
[3320.14s -> 3322.86s]  Uh, I think I do because I upgraded his tent, right?
[3325.58s -> 3326.54s]  Shave his head.
[3327.34s -> 3346.51s]  All right, let's go.
[3348.94s -> 3350.62s]  I'm gonna go do the mica mission
[3351.58s -> 3353.90s]  because it's there and I have to do it at some point.
[3354.54s -> 3360.67s]  Might as well just get it done.
[3361.31s -> 3366.81s]  We'll do the mica mission and then we'll do a...
[3367.93s -> 3369.13s]  We'll do a match.
[3370.83s -> 3374.35s]  We'll do another, like, backstage brawl in WWE.
[3375.07s -> 3377.29s]  I'm thinking about who I'd want to be.
[3381.26s -> 3382.06s]  Fast travel.
[3382.06s -> 3383.82s]  Do I have to go to his tent to fast travel?
[3388.32s -> 3388.56s]  What?
[3388.56s -> 3390.16s]  I didn't even pay attention to how to do that
[3390.16s -> 3391.84s]  because I didn't want to use it originally, so...
[3395.28s -> 3396.24s]  Let's see, where am I going here?
[3398.36s -> 3399.16s]  We're going to...
[3400.60s -> 3401.40s]  Strawberry.
[3405.96s -> 3407.80s]  It's behind his tent.
[3409.24s -> 3411.16s]  Okay.
[3412.43s -> 3414.03s]  Well, where the hell is Dutch's...
[3414.03s -> 3416.51s]  This is the new area we've moved away, so...
[3417.23s -> 3420.60s]  Is it behind my tent or is it behind Dutch's tent?
[3420.60s -> 3428.94s]  In my tent.
[3429.50s -> 3442.11s]  Hmm, on the side?
[3442.11s -> 3443.47s]  It's the map on the side.
[3444.43s -> 3457.47s]  It's shaving kit, clothing change, fast travel.
[3457.47s -> 3457.87s]  There it is.
[3458.91s -> 3461.20s]  Well, apparently not anymore.
[3461.20s -> 3461.70s]  There we go.
[3462.48s -> 3463.28s]  All right, strawberry.
[3463.92s -> 3465.40s]  Does this cost money?
[3466.36s -> 3473.56s]  No, it doesn't.
[3474.12s -> 3474.91s]  That's cool.
[3476.03s -> 3480.54s]  Goodbye.
[3497.04s -> 3499.84s]  That just costed me some sweet vista views.
[3508.19s -> 3509.79s]  Favorite member of Dutch's gang.
[3509.79s -> 3510.99s]  Uh, Jose is cool.
[3511.79s -> 3521.29s]  Fast travel, more like...
[3521.93s -> 3525.16s]  You know what I'm saying?
[3537.76s -> 3539.04s]  All right, Micah, let's go.
[3542.20s -> 3543.40s]  Don't make me regret this.
[3550.35s -> 3552.19s]  Every time you do a mission with Micah,
[3552.19s -> 3554.97s]  you get a $300 bounty somewhere.
[3554.97s -> 3557.26s]  That's why I've avoided it for so long.
[3559.31s -> 3560.83s]  I don't want to go do a bunch of shit and
[3562.30s -> 3564.62s]  get in a lot of trouble and have to pay somebody $300.
[3575.55s -> 3578.75s]  It's like down here.
[3579.31s -> 3587.16s]  Oh, there he is.
[3600.73s -> 3602.33s]  Arthur, what the fuck was that?
[3602.89s -> 3620.03s]  All right, I need to refill one of these cubes.
[3620.03s -> 3623.71s]  Have another one.
[3629.12s -> 3632.51s]  All right, see?
[3632.51s -> 3633.15s]  Everything's fine.
[3633.79s -> 3635.64s]  All right, Micah, what do you want?
[3635.64s -> 3636.12s]  What do you need?
[3636.12s -> 3636.76s]  What do you want me to do?
[3639.50s -> 3640.22s]  Let us begin.
[3644.76s -> 3646.04s]  Hey, Arthur.
[3646.04s -> 3647.24s]  Good to see you.
[3647.24s -> 3650.22s]  Why, you want rescuing again, do you?
[3651.66s -> 3651.98s]  No.
[3651.98s -> 3655.02s]  Why, is Arthur apologizing to the horse for feeding it to you?
[3655.02s -> 3658.94s]  I think he's apologizing for running the horse off the cliff and killing it.
[3658.94s -> 3662.78s]  Like you going off scouting and handing up in jail?
[3662.78s -> 3666.70s]  Dutch said you was a big shadow cast by a tiny tree.
[3666.70s -> 3668.22s]  I don't even know what that means.
[3668.86s -> 3670.46s]  I thought you was a tough boy.
[3671.50s -> 3675.90s]  Not one of those gentlemen trying to protect his riding clothes.
[3675.90s -> 3678.22s]  I just know whenever things get real,
[3678.22s -> 3680.14s]  you turn yellow and lose your head.
[3680.14s -> 3680.70s]  Yellow?
[3680.70s -> 3681.82s]  Sure seems that way.
[3681.82s -> 3685.02s]  So I guess you won't be riding with me to rob the banking coach.
[3687.58s -> 3691.82s]  I heard one of the old Driscoll boys yapping about it while I was inside.
[3691.82s -> 3692.94s]  You and me?
[3692.94s -> 3693.90s]  Do robbery?
[3693.90s -> 3695.66s]  That's what I said, didn't I?
[3695.66s -> 3697.02s]  Am I a tough boy?
[3697.02s -> 3697.26s]  No.
[3699.50s -> 3700.70s]  I'm a solid boy.
[3701.34s -> 3701.74s]  Come on.
[3713.76s -> 3714.88s]  Robbing another bank.
[3715.68s -> 3718.24s]  Can't exactly stay in town now, can I?
[3718.88s -> 3721.60s]  Like I told you, I ain't going back to Dutch
[3721.60s -> 3723.60s]  without a peace offering.
[3723.60s -> 3725.92s]  So what's the deal with this coach?
[3725.92s -> 3726.48s]  What do you mean?
[3727.20s -> 3729.60s]  Comes through about this time every day.
[3729.60s -> 3731.68s]  Like I said, if we were robbing a bank,
[3731.68s -> 3733.76s]  we'd be really far away from it right now.
[3733.76s -> 3734.56s]  How many men?
[3734.56s -> 3735.60s]  Guns.
[3735.60s -> 3735.84s]  Right.
[3735.84s -> 3738.48s]  I've been serious.
[3738.48s -> 3740.00s]  You'll be fine.
[3740.00s -> 3745.36s]  Banks been hiring every trigger man they can get of late.
[3745.36s -> 3746.64s]  The meaner, the better.
[3746.64s -> 3748.52s]  I'm afraid too much.
[3748.52s -> 3749.48s]  Compact and solid.
[3749.48s -> 3754.44s]  Forgive me if I ain't wholly faithful in something an old Driscoll told you.
[3754.44s -> 3756.76s]  When you was half drunk in a jail cell.
[3756.76s -> 3757.80s]  No, I'm not dense.
[3757.80s -> 3761.00s]  He kept yapping about it, saying how they've been hitting it on the regular.
[3761.72s -> 3763.56s]  That's a good lead in my book.
[3763.56s -> 3764.60s]  It is a bank.
[3764.60s -> 3767.00s]  Damn old Trisculls are everywhere.
[3767.00s -> 3768.20s]  We're going to ride to a bank?
[3768.20s -> 3770.84s]  These bastards got ahold of most of Big Valley.
[3770.84s -> 3773.72s]  Heard they took over some big ranch north of here.
[3774.60s -> 3776.20s]  I'm going to play Just Cause 4 when it comes out.
[3776.20s -> 3778.04s]  How the hell do you know how many end up down here anyway?
[3778.04s -> 3778.60s]  I never played Just Cause 3.
[3778.60s -> 3780.20s]  Do you know how it is?
[3780.20s -> 3781.24s]  Do you lose sense?
[3781.24s -> 3781.72s]  No, did I?
[3781.72s -> 3783.48s]  Drink there?
[3783.48s -> 3786.84s]  I think I played, maybe I did play Just Cause 3 for like a day on the multiplayer.
[3786.84s -> 3788.20s]  Nothing that needs to concern you.
[3788.20s -> 3789.48s]  I always pay my share.
[3790.12s -> 3795.48s]  It concerns me when you put us in danger and we don't realize till it's too late.
[3796.28s -> 3798.20s]  Like that move you pulled at Strawberry.
[3799.08s -> 3799.96s]  Just dance.
[3800.84s -> 3802.76s]  Just for your precious guns.
[3802.76s -> 3805.00s]  No, you'll never see a Just Dance stream for me.
[3805.00s -> 3806.84s]  You need to roll a little looser, Morgan.
[3806.84s -> 3808.12s]  Looser?
[3808.12s -> 3812.91s]  I've seen you come full on more than once now.
[3812.91s -> 3814.83s]  The only way you'd ever get a Just Dance stream for me?
[3815.63s -> 3820.99s]  Is if I hired like 30 dancers to dance behind me while we were all in the same costumes.
[3830.56s -> 3831.36s]  Do it.
[3831.36s -> 3842.33s]  Do it one day.
[3842.97s -> 3844.04s]  Just do it now.
[3845.00s -> 3845.56s]  Be right back.
[3846.36s -> 3851.66s]  See you guys in like 15 minutes.
[3858.43s -> 3859.47s]  Here's the spot.
[3859.47s -> 3860.35s]  Hold up on the bridge.
[3860.35s -> 3860.91s]  You got it.
[3870.38s -> 3871.74s]  Should be from over there.
[3871.74s -> 3877.98s]  Doesn't Micah look like he's wearing a rubber mask and over the rubber mask?
[3879.10s -> 3880.06s]  Fake hair.
[3880.06s -> 3881.98s]  Fake mustache, fake beard, fake hair.
[3895.18s -> 3896.22s]  Let's go.
[3897.34s -> 3901.52s]  There's that music.
[3901.52s -> 3903.12s]  Attack the guards and stop the stagecoach.
[3906.99s -> 3920.17s]  Bingo.
[3925.00s -> 3925.88s]  Oh, did I get them all?
[3926.60s -> 3934.24s]  Just leave one guy left, right?
[3935.04s -> 3936.94s]  More.
[3936.94s -> 3937.50s]  See you later.
[3941.68s -> 3944.48s]  Oh, sedazy.
[3949.20s -> 3949.60s]  Got him.
[3949.60s -> 3951.68s]  I shot him right in the tailbone.
[3953.92s -> 3958.01s]  Are you playing Red Dead Online?
[3962.01s -> 3962.89s]  You'll see it tomorrow.
[3963.61s -> 3966.38s]  I feel like it's gonna be wild.
[3969.98s -> 3970.86s]  Wait, I don't get to drive?
[3971.66s -> 3975.64s]  I gotta keep the horses with us.
[3975.64s -> 3976.12s]  Come on, horse.
[3976.12s -> 3976.44s]  Let's go.
[3979.34s -> 3980.06s]  Hat in the wagon.
[3987.16s -> 3990.08s]  Yeah, the hat's fine.
[3999.04s -> 3999.76s]  Maybe it'll fall off.
[4009.31s -> 4009.87s]  Take the hat.
[4009.87s -> 4010.51s]  Take the hat.
[4010.51s -> 4010.99s]  I'll get the hat.
[4019.90s -> 4023.74s]  It's too tense.
[4023.74s -> 4024.54s]  I can't stand it.
[4026.38s -> 4027.42s]  What if the hat falls?
[4046.88s -> 4050.00s]  I'm gonna get that hat.
[4052.68s -> 4053.64s]  No, the mission's gonna fail.
[4053.64s -> 4055.88s]  The mission's gonna fail.
[4055.88s -> 4056.76s]  I don't want to sit through that.
[4056.76s -> 4057.56s]  I don't want to hear him talk.
[4058.36s -> 4059.24s]  I hate this character.
[4064.52s -> 4065.32s]  Forget about the hat.
[4065.80s -> 4066.44s]  It's gone.
[4066.44s -> 4066.92s]  Forever.
[4085.48s -> 4086.76s]  Garbage stream.
[4086.76s -> 4088.20s]  He lost the hat on purpose.
[4089.56s -> 4093.20s]  How much did you pay for Red Dead?
[4093.20s -> 4094.48s]  I did the wrong thing.
[4098.06s -> 4100.14s]  I paid the middle of the road
[4100.14s -> 4101.58s]  special edition, which is
[4102.54s -> 4104.22s]  you just get a cool horse.
[4104.22s -> 4105.34s]  You don't get to participate
[4105.34s -> 4106.78s]  in the beta that happened today.
[4106.78s -> 4107.98s]  Well, I will tomorrow.
[4108.70s -> 4110.62s]  But I bought the one
[4110.62s -> 4111.58s]  that you shouldn't have bought.
[4116.30s -> 4118.11s]  Where's the QTE?
[4119.39s -> 4124.06s]  When is movie night?
[4124.06s -> 4124.94s]  Movie night is Sunday.
[4125.58s -> 4126.06s]  This weekend.
[4126.94s -> 4138.01s]  There we go.
[4138.01s -> 4138.49s]  Watch this.
[4140.22s -> 4142.14s]  One, two, three.
[4142.94s -> 4143.44s]  Activate!
[4146.22s -> 4147.26s]  Oh, I didn't have enough deadeye.
[4147.26s -> 4147.82s]  Oh my god.
[4147.82s -> 4148.62s]  That's a mistake.
[4149.82s -> 4158.62s]  I need deadeye.
[4158.62s -> 4159.82s]  Let's bring Tom.
[4159.82s -> 4174.22s]  No, that's not the guy.
[4176.38s -> 4181.69s]  Banjo-Kazooie music.
[4190.76s -> 4192.44s]  Why is that making me laugh so much?
[4196.36s -> 4209.36s]  When is movie night happening?
[4209.36s -> 4209.92s]  Give it a...
[4209.92s -> 4210.40s]  Oh, Sunday.
[4210.40s -> 4210.90s]  This Sunday.
[4212.56s -> 4213.28s]  It's Sunday night.
[4214.24s -> 4216.72s]  Did I...
[4216.72s -> 4217.22s]  Did I not?
[4218.24s -> 4222.62s]  Maybe I didn't finish my sentence.
[4224.22s -> 4224.62s]  All right.
[4224.62s -> 4225.18s]  Okay.
[4225.18s -> 4225.98s]  Well, we got more.
[4229.39s -> 4233.52s]  People are here.
[4234.56s -> 4235.36s]  So, how many...
[4238.65s -> 4240.44s]  Is it deadeye or not?
[4241.24s -> 4246.60s]  Um, no idea.
[4253.18s -> 4254.30s]  Dark Souls are the light, though.
[4254.30s -> 4254.80s]  Tom.
[4260.22s -> 4261.50s]  What day of the week is Sunday?
[4261.50s -> 4263.98s]  It's the one that comes after Saturday and before Monday.
[4271.02s -> 4271.82s]  Sunday p.m.
[4273.98s -> 4275.58s]  Yeah, Sunday raspberry p.m.
[4282.62s -> 4283.12s]  Got it!
[4289.08s -> 4289.80s]  Do online?
[4289.80s -> 4290.68s]  I can't do online.
[4291.40s -> 4293.16s]  I did not buy the Ultimate Edition.
[4294.36s -> 4295.48s]  I have to wait till tomorrow.
[4295.48s -> 4297.96s]  So, I'm just kind of getting familiar with the video game again.
[4298.92s -> 4301.56s]  So, then I'm prepared tomorrow and I know what I'm doing.
[4311.00s -> 4312.28s]  And like I said.
[4312.28s -> 4313.32s]  Fucking mask.
[4313.32s -> 4314.68s]  Rubber mask.
[4314.68s -> 4317.00s]  With a goddamn fake mustache on it.
[4318.12s -> 4320.60s]  I'll pull that off sooner or later, Micah.
[4320.60s -> 4321.88s]  We'll see who you really are.
[4324.43s -> 4325.15s]  Six hundred bucks.
[4325.15s -> 4325.55s]  Three hundred.
[4325.55s -> 4326.11s]  That's pretty good.
[4326.11s -> 4327.07s]  Three hundred and thirty dollars.
[4338.28s -> 4339.64s]  Ultimate Edition.
[4339.64s -> 4343.24s]  No, the only Ultimate Edition I bought was Zoo Tycoon 2.
[4346.75s -> 4346.99s]  All right.
[4346.99s -> 4347.55s]  Well, there you go.
[4350.56s -> 4351.28s]  Hey, there you go.
[4353.68s -> 4354.08s]  Where...
[4354.80s -> 4358.36s]  I think I was gonna go like this.
[4360.88s -> 4362.32s]  And it was with the money, too.
[4362.32s -> 4363.04s]  What do you mean the money?
[4364.24s -> 4370.33s]  I was trying to...
[4370.33s -> 4371.53s]  I'm trying to launch myself.
[4375.98s -> 4377.50s]  I'm trying to do a springboard.
[4377.50s -> 4379.10s]  Shoot out of the cannon into the water and move.
[4385.82s -> 4387.02s]  It's not gonna happen, is it?
[4387.50s -> 4391.82s]  If it was online, you'd get four dollars and four cents.
[4398.48s -> 4399.68s]  You need to be going faster, though.
[4400.48s -> 4400.80s]  All right.
[4400.80s -> 4401.68s]  So, I'm good with...
[4409.15s -> 4415.63s]  Did you just shoot me off?
[4428.09s -> 4430.17s]  You have mere seconds to live.
[4436.17s -> 4436.57s]  Whoa.
[4436.57s -> 4438.57s]  Crazy Red Dead 2 moments.
[4439.53s -> 4445.63s]  Okay.
[4445.63s -> 4447.15s]  So, we're gonna not all save here.
[4447.15s -> 4447.71s]  So, we're good.
[4449.02s -> 4453.34s]  Let's go do Adam Sandler versus Adam Sandler in a backstage brawl.
[4453.34s -> 4458.78s]  That's not what I'm doing, by the way.
[4458.78s -> 4468.22s]  So many games tonight.
[4468.22s -> 4469.74s]  Yeah, I'm just kind of dicking around.
[4469.74s -> 4472.06s]  I was hoping I could play the online.
[4472.06s -> 4473.42s]  That was the plan that I found out
[4474.06s -> 4475.26s]  that I wasn't gonna be able to play it.
[4475.26s -> 4478.84s]  So, just hanging out tonight.
[4478.84s -> 4480.92s]  And we're gonna be going tomorrow, too.
[4480.92s -> 4481.48s]  So, don't worry.
[4482.20s -> 4483.92s]  I had fun tonight, though.
[4485.24s -> 4488.44s]  Zoo Tycoon was really interesting for the first like, you know, three or four hours.
[4495.16s -> 4498.20s]  So, let's get this changed.
[4498.92s -> 4500.17s]  We don't really...
[4500.17s -> 4502.17s]  I don't even really change the title.
[4502.17s -> 4502.81s]  I don't think...
[4510.91s -> 4511.47s]  Wait, what?
[4512.19s -> 4519.88s]  Wait a minute.
[4519.88s -> 4536.52s]  What the fuck is happening?
[4547.98s -> 4553.12s]  I have this on PC.
[4553.12s -> 4554.56s]  That's why it's like that.
[4559.13s -> 4560.73s]  Why do I have this on PS4?
[4560.73s -> 4561.37s]  What happened?
[4561.37s -> 4561.61s]  What?
[4563.08s -> 4564.28s]  Oh, fuck.
[4564.28s -> 4565.96s]  Okay, I know what happened.
[4565.96s -> 4570.09s]  I bought the game twice.
[4578.91s -> 4580.27s]  Like, between...
[4580.99s -> 4582.35s]  From probably a while ago.
[4582.35s -> 4583.23s]  When did I buy this?
[4584.56s -> 4585.20s]  How long?
[4585.20s -> 4586.00s]  Am I crazy?
[4592.01s -> 4594.01s]  That's why there was a random...
[4594.01s -> 4602.14s]  That was gonna be Beanbag Sonic from whenever the fuck I started it.
[4602.14s -> 4602.86s]  I must have gone...
[4602.86s -> 4604.06s]  Oh, wait, there's a PC version.
[4604.06s -> 4605.10s]  Fuck, isn't there?
[4605.10s -> 4605.58s]  And I bought...
[4605.58s -> 4605.82s]  Yeah.
[4606.83s -> 4607.47s]  Well, okay.
[4613.76s -> 4614.24s]  All right.
[4615.87s -> 4616.99s]  I bought it twice.
[4617.71s -> 4623.52s]  Now, let's open the real one.
[4623.52s -> 4626.08s]  The one that has the fucking 40 characters on it.
[4626.08s -> 4627.20s]  I can't believe I didn't like...
[4629.44s -> 4634.36s]  It did not deserve to be bought twice.
[4634.36s -> 4634.92s]  I was just...
[4635.88s -> 4638.52s]  My brain just did not comprehend what was just going on right there.
[4645.37s -> 4646.01s]  Yeah.
[4646.01s -> 4647.37s]  So, like six...
[4647.37s -> 4648.89s]  Yeah, like probably seven days ago.
[4648.89s -> 4649.61s]  Eight days ago.
[4650.97s -> 4653.29s]  I bought it on PS4 because I didn't think it was on PC.
[4655.39s -> 4657.39s]  And then I realized it was on PC.
[4657.39s -> 4658.83s]  I started making somebody.
[4659.55s -> 4668.60s]  Yeah, I'll take off the delay thing.
[4669.16s -> 4675.08s]  You don't remember eight days ago?
[4675.08s -> 4676.12s]  Well, no, I do.
[4676.12s -> 4677.80s]  I remember buying it, but I don't remember when.
[4679.00s -> 4681.00s]  The timeline is not in my brain
[4681.00s -> 4683.08s]  because I spent so much time in the PC one.
[4684.12s -> 4687.48s]  This guy buys games and forgets.
[4688.36s -> 4693.74s]  I forgot to like fucking...
[4693.74s -> 4694.22s]  I don't think you can...
[4694.22s -> 4696.54s]  You can't even refund a game on PS4, can you?
[4698.19s -> 4699.31s]  If you download it digitally?
[4699.87s -> 4710.89s]  All right, let's open up the real one.
[4710.89s -> 4711.85s]  Here it is.
[4711.85s -> 4717.77s]  I was wondering why that was fucking stupid.
[4718.49s -> 4718.81s]  All right.
[4722.36s -> 4723.32s]  Here it comes.
[4727.08s -> 4727.80s]  And I...
[4727.80s -> 4730.84s]  And this one was like 50% off on Steam.
[4731.64s -> 4736.64s]  That's the worst part.
[4736.64s -> 4738.56s]  And I just hurt myself in my ears.
[4739.60s -> 4757.07s]  I'm really sorry that happened, everybody.
[4767.20s -> 4769.20s]  The outro is playing.
[4769.84s -> 4771.58s]  Hey, look, that guy's dabbing.
[4772.22s -> 4777.28s]  Okay, let's go to play here.
[4777.92s -> 4779.23s]  Here you go.
[4779.23s -> 4782.59s]  Let's do backstage brawl.
[4783.31s -> 4784.91s]  Here's the match we're going to do.
[4798.92s -> 4799.48s]  Really, game?
[4799.48s -> 4799.88s]  You can't...
[4810.20s -> 4811.16s]  No duplicates.
[4816.32s -> 4816.88s]  I got an idea.
[4816.88s -> 4817.36s]  How about we do...
[4818.16s -> 4821.40s]  Oh, that's right.
[4821.40s -> 4822.44s]  I forgot we made him too.
[4822.44s -> 4823.00s]  All right, let's do...
[4823.96s -> 4827.20s]  Let's do the two actors.
[4828.16s -> 4832.57s]  Oh, no.
[4832.57s -> 4835.39s]  Willem Dafoe versus the Nintendo Labo.
[4835.39s -> 4836.51s]  Sounds right to me.
[4836.51s -> 4837.07s]  Let's do it.
[4842.59s -> 4843.31s]  He's really good.
[4843.31s -> 4843.63s]  He is.
[4844.19s -> 4856.83s]  Not even going to wait.
[4856.83s -> 4857.55s]  Spun him around.
[4857.55s -> 4857.95s]  I've yet...
[4857.95s -> 4858.67s]  Where's the punch?
[4860.19s -> 4861.23s]  Talking shit in his face.
[4862.11s -> 4865.42s]  At least it's even.
[4866.06s -> 4870.06s]  The Labo is just a Minecraft character.
[4875.32s -> 4876.28s]  Kick his ass, Dafoe.
[4883.76s -> 4884.96s]  Everybody ends it instantly.
[4884.96s -> 4886.40s]  I would laugh by myself.
[4886.40s -> 4891.12s]  But I've been Red Dead.
[4891.76s -> 4892.96s]  The stream is pretty much over.
[4892.96s -> 4894.16s]  I'm just doing this for fun.
[4894.88s -> 4900.56s]  Dude, even me versus the Labo.
[4901.92s -> 4905.37s]  Come on, bend him.
[4905.37s -> 4906.33s]  Fold him.
[4906.33s -> 4911.44s]  This is how I treat my Labo creations.
[4911.44s -> 4912.72s]  I mean, not completely...
[4913.52s -> 4914.56s]  Not completely untrue.
[4915.28s -> 4920.36s]  You can't lift him.
[4921.32s -> 4926.86s]  The stock sound effects really are so stupid.
[4927.58s -> 4932.59s]  So how does this end?
[4938.46s -> 4940.30s]  I'm thinking Labo is going to go through a table.
[4940.94s -> 4943.66s]  Going to the locker room.
[4943.66s -> 4946.62s]  Don't just fight out here next to the sound equipment.
[4958.86s -> 4961.18s]  They keep doing the throw him into the wall thing.
[4963.31s -> 4963.95s]  There we go.
[4963.95s -> 4964.99s]  Into the locker room.
[4964.99s -> 4965.95s]  Make something happen here.
[4979.04s -> 4979.60s]  Jesus.
[4980.24s -> 4983.56s]  That could end really quickly.
[4984.20s -> 4989.28s]  I love how that's just a big giant...
[4989.28s -> 4990.70s]  He's going to kill him.
[4991.34s -> 4994.64s]  There's just a cartoon trash can in here.
[5002.20s -> 5005.50s]  Get back in there.
[5006.78s -> 5008.51s]  His head's too big.
[5009.15s -> 5010.11s]  His head is too big.
[5010.67s -> 5015.87s]  Just let him go.
[5015.87s -> 5016.43s]  That's it?
[5017.23s -> 5018.35s]  You just let him go.
[5022.12s -> 5023.72s]  He picked him up and dropped him.
[5032.38s -> 5038.28s]  That's going to be it.
[5038.92s -> 5040.81s]  That was fucking stupid.
[5045.00s -> 5046.20s]  No, I don't want to...
[5046.20s -> 5047.40s]  If I'm going to do wrestling stuff,
[5047.40s -> 5051.23s]  I want it to be something that I think about
[5051.23s -> 5052.19s]  and well thought out.
[5052.19s -> 5053.31s]  Not just random matches.
[5053.95s -> 5054.75s]  Maybe someday.
[5057.15s -> 5058.35s]  Create Super Sandler.
[5058.35s -> 5061.00s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5061.00s -> 5061.56s]  Not tonight.
[5062.12s -> 5068.49s]  I might increase the frequency that we do stuff like this,
[5069.77s -> 5072.89s]  but not so much where it happens all the time.
[5073.45s -> 5081.71s]  But anyways, that's going to be it for tonight.
[5082.43s -> 5083.39s]  Thank you for sticking around.
[5084.27s -> 5086.99s]  A little bit of a just chill stream.
[5086.99s -> 5087.23s]  We...
[5088.70s -> 5088.94s]  We...
[5089.82s -> 5090.54s]  Something in my throat.
[5092.96s -> 5093.84s]  Played a couple of games.
[5094.56s -> 5096.67s]  Thanks for joining me.
[5097.23s -> 5098.97s]  And we'll do the bits
[5098.97s -> 5100.81s]  and we'll do the credits at the end.
[5101.61s -> 5104.17s]  See you guys tomorrow for Red Dead Multiplayer.
[5104.89s -> 5108.57s]  I'm not going to start as late as I did today.
[5109.63s -> 5111.07s]  I will be starting at probably...
[5114.27s -> 5115.55s]  An hour or two before.
[5116.35s -> 5117.31s]  So somewhere around...
[5120.04s -> 5122.28s]  Probably like five or six Eastern.
[5123.00s -> 5124.09s]  I'd like to start.
[5126.86s -> 5129.66s]  I'm not going to finish the main story in Red Dead tomorrow.
[5130.46s -> 5131.18s]  Oh, I don't know.
[5131.18s -> 5132.70s]  Maybe if Multiplayer...
[5133.58s -> 5135.02s]  Do Multiplayer for a few hours.
[5135.02s -> 5135.74s]  See how it goes.
[5135.74s -> 5136.54s]  If I'm still having fun,
[5136.54s -> 5137.50s]  maybe I'll just transition
[5137.50s -> 5138.62s]  and just keep going in Red Dead.
[5138.62s -> 5139.18s]  I don't know.
[5139.18s -> 5139.58s]  We'll see.
[5140.54s -> 5143.71s]  Did you miss the green screen movie night?
[5143.71s -> 5144.19s]  You did not.
[5144.19s -> 5144.83s]  That is Sunday.
[5146.00s -> 5146.80s]  Sunday night.
[5147.36s -> 5153.96s]  So with that, let's go back.
[5157.39s -> 5158.83s]  Just about six hours ago now.
[5161.76s -> 5163.36s]  It's really a six hour stream.
[5164.00s -> 5167.95s]  I thought it was a little shorter than that,
[5167.95s -> 5170.94s]  but I guess not.
[5170.94s -> 5174.22s]  So starting here with Peter.
[5174.22s -> 5176.06s]  Thank you, Peter, for the $3.33.
[5176.06s -> 5176.70s]  Cool guy.
[5176.70s -> 5177.26s]  Thank you, Peter.
[5178.65s -> 5179.13s]  Do test.
[5179.13s -> 5179.85s]  Thanks for the $1.
[5180.49s -> 5180.81s]  Parts.
[5181.37s -> 5182.62s]  Appreciate it.
[5183.92s -> 5184.88s]  Nostalgic Nerd.
[5184.88s -> 5185.76s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[5185.76s -> 5187.12s]  Hey, Durban, wanted to sincerely thank you
[5187.12s -> 5189.28s]  for all the hard and amazing work you do on these streams.
[5189.28s -> 5191.84s]  You helped me get through some rough times in high school
[5192.48s -> 5194.08s]  and the death of my great uncle.
[5194.08s -> 5195.68s]  I can never fully repay you for what you've done
[5196.32s -> 5198.41s]  for me, but this is a start.
[5198.41s -> 5199.85s]  Thanks, fellow New Englander.
[5201.48s -> 5202.92s]  Thank you, Nostalgic Nerd.
[5205.44s -> 5207.12s]  Yeah, the music is not on.
[5207.12s -> 5207.84s]  That's correct.
[5209.69s -> 5211.69s]  I'm sorry to hear about your loss.
[5215.55s -> 5216.99s]  There is no repaying me,
[5217.55s -> 5218.83s]  so don't worry about that.
[5219.47s -> 5222.54s]  Thank you for the $10 regardless,
[5222.54s -> 5226.01s]  but you don't have to pay me money
[5226.01s -> 5228.08s]  because you think that you owe it.
[5228.08s -> 5229.04s]  You don't.
[5229.04s -> 5230.16s]  So thank you, though.
[5230.16s -> 5231.28s]  And fellow New Englander.
[5232.91s -> 5234.35s]  Yeah, New England's great.
[5234.91s -> 5236.84s]  I'm in Las Vegas at the moment, though.
[5238.78s -> 5243.44s]  Not sure where I'll be in the next couple of years.
[5243.44s -> 5243.92s]  I don't know.
[5243.92s -> 5245.28s]  Depends on how much I like it here.
[5247.56s -> 5249.16s]  I'm up in the air right now,
[5249.16s -> 5253.16s]  but thank you, Nostalgic Nerd, for the $10
[5253.16s -> 5254.12s]  and that wonderful message.
[5254.12s -> 5254.62s]  Thank you.
[5256.90s -> 5259.30s]  Thank you, Spartanese, for the $1.
[5260.30s -> 5261.50s]  Thank you, Enamelint.
[5262.54s -> 5264.22s]  Enamelint for the $10.
[5265.10s -> 5266.46s]  Thanks to the stream, German.
[5266.46s -> 5267.18s]  It's been a rough day,
[5267.18s -> 5269.02s]  but your streams never fail to cheer me up.
[5269.02s -> 5270.06s]  Cheer my heart.
[5270.06s -> 5273.86s]  Thank you so much, Enamelint.
[5273.86s -> 5278.66s]  Thank you for the $10.
[5279.54s -> 5281.28s]  Sorry to hear about your days
[5281.28s -> 5282.32s]  and how it's been going so well.
[5282.88s -> 5284.99s]  Hopefully tomorrow's better.
[5284.99s -> 5286.76s]  Thank you.
[5287.30s -> 5289.92s]  Kumutosen.
[5289.92s -> 5293.38s]  Thanks for the $10, Kumutosen.
[5293.38s -> 5294.18s]  10 bucks.
[5294.18s -> 5295.54s]  $10 three times in a row here, guys.
[5295.54s -> 5296.34s]  Thank you.
[5296.34s -> 5297.70s]  Hey, German, it's my birthday today.
[5298.66s -> 5299.46s]  Thank you for all the laughs.
[5299.46s -> 5300.42s]  I've been incredibly depressed
[5300.42s -> 5301.54s]  for the past while,
[5301.54s -> 5302.42s]  and your videos and streams
[5302.42s -> 5303.38s]  have helped cheer me up.
[5303.38s -> 5305.22s]  There's a small token of my appreciation.
[5305.22s -> 5306.75s]  Keep up the good work.
[5306.75s -> 5310.40s]  You're really doing a lot of good.
[5310.40s -> 5312.00s]  Well, happy birthday.
[5312.00s -> 5313.12s]  Hopefully it's still your birthday
[5313.12s -> 5314.24s]  because that was a while ago,
[5314.24s -> 5315.84s]  and if it's past your birthday,
[5316.77s -> 5318.53s]  happy second birthday,
[5318.53s -> 5320.16s]  which is tomorrow,
[5320.16s -> 5322.08s]  which is today for you, potentially,
[5322.08s -> 5325.18s]  depending on where you are in the world.
[5325.18s -> 5326.06s]  But thank you so much.
[5326.06s -> 5326.78s]  Happy birthday.
[5329.04s -> 5330.32s]  Sorry to hear about
[5330.32s -> 5334.80s]  that you've been feeling bad.
[5334.80s -> 5335.52s]  If you're having fun,
[5335.52s -> 5336.24s]  that makes me happy.
[5336.24s -> 5337.28s]  So thank you.
[5341.63s -> 5343.39s]  It's a double birthday.
[5346.46s -> 5348.46s]  Thank you, Spartanis, again for the $1.
[5348.46s -> 5349.57s]  Spartanis again.
[5349.57s -> 5352.05s]  Spartanis gave one, two, three, four, five.
[5352.05s -> 5353.49s]  Five dollars here.
[5353.49s -> 5355.55s]  We're almost six dollars here.
[5355.55s -> 5358.58s]  No message, just dropping bits.
[5358.58s -> 5358.98s]  Thank you.
[5361.33s -> 5362.13s]  Dog memes.
[5362.13s -> 5364.24s]  Thanks for the $10.
[5364.24s -> 5365.36s]  Dog memes.
[5365.36s -> 5367.54s]  Hey, German, memes aside,
[5367.54s -> 5369.22s]  I've been watching you since the TF2 days.
[5372.05s -> 5373.49s]  Six years later,
[5373.49s -> 5374.86s]  and you're still going strong.
[5374.86s -> 5375.58s]  Here's some money.
[5375.58s -> 5376.62s]  Spend it on whatever you want.
[5376.62s -> 5377.74s]  Thanks for being a cool guy.
[5381.79s -> 5382.11s]  Thank you.
[5383.63s -> 5384.83s]  Thank you for being nice enough to
[5385.92s -> 5389.18s]  pay money to somebody on the internet.
[5389.18s -> 5391.39s]  You know what I mean?
[5393.22s -> 5393.70s]  All of you.
[5396.38s -> 5398.86s]  Six years ago.
[5398.86s -> 5399.66s]  That's so long.
[5401.44s -> 5402.08s]  Can you imagine?
[5403.28s -> 5404.48s]  Fast forward like a few years.
[5405.36s -> 5406.64s]  Like, oh yeah, I've been watching you
[5406.64s -> 5407.12s]  for 10 years.
[5407.12s -> 5408.64s]  Oh, 10 years ago when I started.
[5409.28s -> 5411.30s]  Who knows?
[5415.89s -> 5419.14s]  I can't even fathom saying those words.
[5421.34s -> 5423.90s]  Because right now it's about six and a half to seven.
[5423.90s -> 5425.54s]  Yeah.
[5425.54s -> 5426.50s]  Another few years,
[5426.50s -> 5427.54s]  and it's going to be a decade.
[5431.23s -> 5431.95s]  That's crazy.
[5435.39s -> 5436.11s]  At that point,
[5436.11s -> 5438.11s]  that's a significant portion of my entire life.
[5439.71s -> 5441.63s]  Will have been doing this.
[5442.43s -> 5443.71s]  On YouTube, on Twitch,
[5443.71s -> 5445.47s]  or wherever and whatever I end up doing.
[5447.82s -> 5448.30s]  We'll see.
[5448.30s -> 5449.74s]  I don't give myself a time limit,
[5449.74s -> 5450.94s]  but I don't give myself a
[5451.66s -> 5453.66s]  amount of time that I have to do it.
[5453.66s -> 5456.98s]  It's not like, oh yeah,
[5456.98s -> 5458.34s]  well, you know, in 20 years
[5458.34s -> 5462.18s]  when I'm still streaming on German 985 Twitch.
[5462.18s -> 5462.82s]  I don't know.
[5462.82s -> 5466.32s]  It's very significant already, though.
[5466.32s -> 5466.64s]  It's true.
[5472.29s -> 5473.17s]  But thank you, Dom.
[5473.89s -> 5474.53s]  Dog memes.
[5475.25s -> 5476.24s]  Appreciate it.
[5477.82s -> 5478.78s]  Gentle ghosts.
[5478.78s -> 5479.66s]  Thanks for the five dollars.
[5479.66s -> 5482.06s]  Hey, German, my friend Warren,
[5482.06s -> 5483.63s]  who is also a big fan of yours,
[5483.63s -> 5485.23s]  is turning 18 this week.
[5485.79s -> 5487.87s]  I was wondering if you could wish him a happy birthday.
[5487.87s -> 5489.55s]  You've been watching your content with me
[5489.55s -> 5490.27s]  for the past few years,
[5490.27s -> 5491.47s]  and I'm sure you'll mean a lot to him.
[5491.47s -> 5491.79s]  Thanks.
[5492.90s -> 5493.14s]  Yeah.
[5493.78s -> 5494.74s]  Happy birthday, Warren.
[5497.41s -> 5498.29s]  18.
[5498.29s -> 5503.33s]  Significant milestone.
[5503.33s -> 5504.93s]  That's the, you're an adult.
[5505.49s -> 5510.34s]  Except I didn't really become an adult
[5510.34s -> 5512.18s]  until I was probably like 26.
[5514.70s -> 5519.92s]  So sing him the rat song.
[5520.56s -> 5522.62s]  A lot of birthdays, huh?
[5523.34s -> 5524.22s]  This week?
[5524.22s -> 5524.70s]  Today?
[5524.70s -> 5525.18s]  Tomorrow?
[5525.82s -> 5533.71s]  Thank you, gentle ghosts.
[5533.71s -> 5535.87s]  And again, happy birthday to Warren.
[5535.87s -> 5536.59s]  Thanks for watching.
[5537.31s -> 5544.34s]  You guys rock.
[5544.34s -> 5544.74s]  Thank you.
[5544.74s -> 5546.02s]  Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar.
[5546.02s -> 5547.62s]  I was rewatching you play Mario Tennis
[5547.62s -> 5548.90s]  and you mentioned a music stream.
[5549.54s -> 5550.66s]  Has that been canceled?
[5551.30s -> 5552.66s]  Looking forward to the green screen.
[5552.66s -> 5553.06s]  Movie night.
[5553.06s -> 5554.26s]  I'm currently working on a submission.
[5554.26s -> 5555.38s]  Hopefully it will be done in time.
[5555.38s -> 5555.86s]  Take care.
[5561.18s -> 5562.78s]  I haven't, like, I don't cancel.
[5564.24s -> 5564.64s]  Ideas.
[5565.90s -> 5566.70s]  It took a long time.
[5566.70s -> 5568.22s]  Think about this, right?
[5568.22s -> 5569.66s]  The detective stream.
[5569.66s -> 5572.62s]  The green screen stream.
[5572.62s -> 5575.73s]  Think of how long it took to actually get that done.
[5577.87s -> 5580.35s]  So it's not like it ever goes away completely.
[5582.58s -> 5584.18s]  That green screen stream was mentioned
[5585.46s -> 5587.38s]  more than three or four months ago.
[5590.75s -> 5593.39s]  And then, you know, when they happen, they happen.
[5595.31s -> 5596.91s]  Kind of have to be in the right mindset.
[5596.91s -> 5597.71s]  Time has to be right.
[5597.71s -> 5599.15s]  I have to get the right resources ready
[5601.70s -> 5602.98s]  and try to get it done, you know?
[5606.61s -> 5607.89s]  The detective stream was also,
[5607.89s -> 5609.09s]  that took a while to do as well.
[5609.73s -> 5612.54s]  God, I want to do that again.
[5612.54s -> 5614.06s]  But, like, more elaborate.
[5614.06s -> 5617.18s]  I have no idea.
[5617.18s -> 5619.26s]  I got to think of some stupid ideas for that one.
[5620.22s -> 5621.98s]  But thank you, Dr. Clay.
[5621.98s -> 5624.98s]  No, nothing is ever, ever canceled.
[5625.54s -> 5627.39s]  They just get moved around.
[5629.34s -> 5631.98s]  Hey, DivUSP.
[5631.98s -> 5633.10s]  I'm just kidding.
[5633.10s -> 5636.03s]  Thank you, Divus, for the three dollars.
[5636.03s -> 5637.71s]  DivusP for the three bucks.
[5637.71s -> 5643.17s]  Appreciate it.
[5643.17s -> 5643.57s]  No message.
[5643.57s -> 5647.02s]  Thank you for the three dollars.
[5647.02s -> 5648.62s]  Fisherman friend zone.
[5648.62s -> 5650.78s]  Thanks for the one dollar.
[5650.78s -> 5652.30s]  My first experience.
[5653.26s -> 5655.26s]  My first Jerma experience was in the video
[5655.26s -> 5657.79s]  Ruiner of Fun, a.k.a.
[5657.79s -> 5658.83s]  Jerma's Mad Part 1.
[5658.83s -> 5661.36s]  I've been a fan ever since.
[5661.36s -> 5663.52s]  Also, can you do the Neelix voice, please?
[5665.26s -> 5665.58s]  Why?
[5666.90s -> 5668.74s]  I just can't believe.
[5668.74s -> 5672.58s]  I'm dressing up as Neelix for Halloween next year.
[5673.14s -> 5674.82s]  And everyone's going to hate my guts.
[5675.38s -> 5678.56s]  Hey, Elizabeth.
[5678.56s -> 5679.52s]  Thanks for the one dollar.
[5679.52s -> 5680.88s]  Show this on stream.
[5683.58s -> 5686.00s]  Well, first of all, let me see what it is.
[5686.64s -> 5701.33s]  Wait, what?
[5716.19s -> 5717.31s]  Don't get into that shit.
[5718.43s -> 5719.31s]  Don't do that shit.
[5720.51s -> 5726.18s]  What?
[5726.18s -> 5726.90s]  What's wrong with that?
[5727.62s -> 5729.41s]  What's wrong with that?
[5734.80s -> 5735.76s]  Go to bed.
[5735.76s -> 5737.52s]  Yeah, like go to bed.
[5737.52s -> 5740.08s]  Like you don't have to do anything crazy.
[5740.80s -> 5750.67s]  Streamer promoting the use of drugs.
[5750.67s -> 5751.15s]  No, I didn't.
[5752.45s -> 5754.05s]  I said, if you want to do that,
[5754.61s -> 5756.13s]  if you want to do that,
[5756.13s -> 5758.61s]  then this is what I wouldn't be doing that.
[5758.61s -> 5760.53s]  And I would never condone.
[5760.53s -> 5761.33s]  Actually, I would.
[5761.97s -> 5767.25s]  I don't smoke marijuana,
[5768.05s -> 5769.94s]  but I don't smoke weed or anything.
[5771.86s -> 5773.70s]  But I do recognize its benefits.
[5774.34s -> 5778.22s]  You probably think I'm just,
[5778.22s -> 5779.98s]  oh, he's probably like high every stream.
[5779.98s -> 5780.86s]  Did you hear what he said?
[5780.86s -> 5781.82s]  What the fuck?
[5782.54s -> 5783.90s]  She's definitely high.
[5785.46s -> 5785.78s]  Really?
[5785.78s -> 5788.74s]  You ever like see somebody high on fucking marijuana before?
[5789.30s -> 5790.67s]  They don't talk about like,
[5791.23s -> 5792.85s]  they don't talk about like their,
[5792.85s -> 5793.89s]  like their dreams.
[5793.89s -> 5794.37s]  Yeah, they do.
[5795.01s -> 5799.17s]  They don't talk about like checking asses.
[5799.17s -> 5799.65s]  Yeah, they do.
[5800.85s -> 5801.49s]  Point stands.
[5810.99s -> 5812.80s]  They don't talk about Garfield.
[5812.80s -> 5813.44s]  Yes, they do.
[5814.08s -> 5816.98s]  Doesn't matter.
[5816.98s -> 5820.74s]  If whatever you're doing is legal,
[5820.74s -> 5821.70s]  and you're all right,
[5821.70s -> 5822.42s]  and you're safe,
[5822.42s -> 5823.46s]  and you're being responsible,
[5824.26s -> 5825.57s]  whatever.
[5825.57s -> 5826.93s]  Think I got a problem with it?
[5827.49s -> 5839.50s]  But thank you, Elizabeth, for the $1.
[5839.50s -> 5840.94s]  Thank you, sly161 for the $1.
[5840.94s -> 5842.06s]  Hey, Jerma, I'm in the middle of class.
[5842.06s -> 5843.74s]  Can you please pause the stream for two hours?
[5844.96s -> 5846.32s]  I can't do that.
[5846.32s -> 5847.36s]  I can't do that.
[5851.58s -> 5854.94s]  Thank you, Yeetee, in Yeetee,
[5855.74s -> 5858.22s]  tweet in Deetee for the $2.
[5859.70s -> 5860.10s]  Thank you.
[5860.74s -> 5867.60s]  Uh, is it cut tag or Q cut tag?
[5867.60s -> 5868.96s]  Thanks for the $4.
[5868.96s -> 5871.63s]  How'd, how do you donate?
[5872.19s -> 5877.14s]  You figured it out, I think.
[5877.70s -> 5881.07s]  Looks like you got it.
[5881.07s -> 5884.27s]  Thank you for the $4.
[5884.27s -> 5886.32s]  Appreciate it.
[5886.32s -> 5889.20s]  Uh, Dorosophilia, thanks for the $1.
[5889.20s -> 5891.20s]  Hey, man, I couldn't find the donate button.
[5891.20s -> 5893.28s]  This streamer doesn't have any on-screen text
[5893.28s -> 5894.72s]  or information in the stream title
[5894.72s -> 5895.60s]  telling me how to donate.
[5896.24s -> 5897.44s]  So I didn't know what else to do.
[5897.44s -> 5898.88s]  Pretty unprofessional, if you ask me.
[5898.88s -> 5901.20s]  Would you kindly pass along my money to him?
[5901.20s -> 5901.68s]  Yeah, sure.
[5902.24s -> 5903.52s]  Oh, that's from what it was, okay.
[5911.46s -> 5913.49s]  Thank you, Dorosophilia.
[5913.49s -> 5918.67s]  Thank you, uh, thank you, Dylan C for $3.
[5920.10s -> 5922.34s]  Thank you for $5.
[5922.34s -> 5924.42s]  I've been a fan of yours since the seventh grade.
[5924.98s -> 5927.46s]  Your YouTube videos and streams
[5927.46s -> 5928.50s]  always give me a good laugh.
[5929.14s -> 5932.91s]  They have also helped me through rough times
[5932.91s -> 5934.51s]  such as stressful days at college
[5935.23s -> 5939.23s]  for after I run a,
[5940.50s -> 5944.34s]  after there was a fire call to the fire department.
[5944.34s -> 5945.14s]  I volunteer.
[5946.75s -> 5947.87s]  Uh, I know it's not much,
[5947.87s -> 5949.63s]  but thanks for the fun times.
[5950.50s -> 5952.58s]  Or after I run a nasty fire call.
[5952.58s -> 5956.70s]  I see.
[5956.70s -> 5957.34s]  It's not much,
[5957.34s -> 5958.78s]  but thank you for all the fun times.
[5960.61s -> 5961.33s]  Don't worry about it.
[5961.33s -> 5962.61s]  Thank you for the $5.
[5969.97s -> 5973.17s]  Doesn't matter if you give $1, $5, $10.
[5973.89s -> 5976.05s]  Don't ever, ever feel like it's something
[5976.05s -> 5980.61s]  that you need to be sorry about.
[5981.25s -> 5982.45s]  Oh, sorry, sorry.
[5982.45s -> 5983.73s]  I'm only going to give you $5.
[5983.73s -> 5984.45s]  It's not much.
[5984.45s -> 5985.01s]  Yes, it is.
[5987.54s -> 5987.94s]  It is.
[5988.50s -> 5991.41s]  Just the fact that you decided to
[5991.41s -> 5991.97s]  in the first place.
[5991.97s -> 5992.85s]  Don't worry.
[5992.85s -> 5999.12s]  I don't want anyone to ever have to apologize
[5999.12s -> 6004.35s]  for giving me your money.
[6004.35s -> 6005.57s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6006.78s -> 6008.86s]  Thank you for even considering.
[6016.06s -> 6016.62s]  Much love to you.
[6016.62s -> 6017.50s]  Thanks for the $5.
[6019.04s -> 6019.68s]  Super seal.
[6019.68s -> 6020.72s]  Thanks for the $1.
[6020.72s -> 6022.00s]  There's an image.
[6022.00s -> 6022.88s]  Let's see what it is.
[6023.52s -> 6034.51s]  It is of, uh, what the fuck?
[6043.30s -> 6044.98s]  Well, that's not terrifying at all.
[6045.94s -> 6046.34s]  Thank you.
[6046.34s -> 6047.86s]  Super seal for the ice cream.
[6049.46s -> 6049.86s]  I guess.
[6052.00s -> 6052.40s]  Thank you.
[6053.74s -> 6054.38s]  Frody and weapon.
[6054.38s -> 6055.50s]  Thanks for the $1.
[6055.50s -> 6055.98s]  No message.
[6055.98s -> 6056.38s]  Thank you.

[6057.18s -> 6058.62s]  Thanks for the $15.
[6058.62s -> 6060.88s]  Palette of produce.
[6060.88s -> 6063.06s]  No message from Palette here,
[6063.06s -> 6064.02s]  but thank you so much.
[6064.74s -> 6065.86s]  For you 15 bucks.
[6067.78s -> 6068.74s]  That's a new emote.
[6068.74s -> 6069.22s]  Oh, God.
[6072.16s -> 6072.80s]  Extra cheesy.
[6072.80s -> 6073.36s]  Thanks for the $1.
[6074.24s -> 6076.86s]  Why are the beavers living in raw sewage?
[6076.86s -> 6077.98s]  No, that was a habitat that was
[6077.98s -> 6079.50s]  created with craft and care.
[6080.38s -> 6082.62s]  And I made sure to make it as comfortable as I could.
[6086.02s -> 6087.46s]  They had, they had a good life.
[6089.92s -> 6090.64s]  Snooze and copter.
[6090.64s -> 6091.52s]  Thanks for the $1.
[6091.52s -> 6098.56s]  It is a, I've actually seen a couple pieces of art for this.
[6098.56s -> 6099.12s]  This is awesome.
[6100.08s -> 6101.12s]  Thank you, snoozing copter.
[6103.30s -> 6105.30s]  Super Jax and the blue screen of death.
[6109.86s -> 6110.42s]  That's great.
[6114.70s -> 6117.42s]  Snooze and copter says for another dollar here.
[6117.42s -> 6117.66s]  Whoops.
[6117.66s -> 6119.34s]  I didn't attach a message.
[6119.34s -> 6121.52s]  It's all good, man.
[6124.18s -> 6127.46s]  Yeah, I've seen a couple pieces of art.
[6128.10s -> 6129.78s]  The rumble a couple nights ago.
[6129.78s -> 6130.82s]  It's great.
[6130.82s -> 6131.22s]  I love it.
[6132.64s -> 6133.04s]  Thank you.
[6134.58s -> 6135.30s]  Extra cheesy.
[6135.30s -> 6136.10s]  Thanks for the $1.
[6136.10s -> 6136.58s]  Beaver.
[6138.46s -> 6141.90s]  No, there was, there was, the beaver habitat
[6143.12s -> 6144.56s]  was a well taken care of.
[6145.76s -> 6147.68s]  Established zoologist.
[6150.06s -> 6154.62s]  They were auto-emote incoming.
[6157.52s -> 6160.00s]  The beavers were taken care of just fine.
[6160.00s -> 6161.44s]  And there, there was no issues.
[6161.44s -> 6162.48s]  There were no problems.
[6162.48s -> 6166.19s]  Appreciate the a dollar.
[6166.19s -> 6167.95s]  Appreciate the a dollar though.
[6167.95s -> 6171.52s]  That was really, really, really worded.
[6171.52s -> 6172.90s]  But thanks.
[6174.38s -> 6176.14s]  Dr. Froman.
[6176.14s -> 6177.10s]  Thanks for the $1.
[6177.10s -> 6178.14s]  Thanks for being an awesome streamer.
[6178.14s -> 6179.26s]  Looking forward to the movie night.
[6179.26s -> 6180.22s]  Me too.
[6180.22s -> 6182.67s]  It's coming up really quick.
[6182.67s -> 6184.19s]  Again, I got to reiterate this.
[6184.19s -> 6185.47s]  Make sure that if you have a submission,
[6185.47s -> 6187.23s]  you get it in by Thursday at midnight.
[6187.87s -> 6190.27s]  That is not even, that's two days from now.
[6192.42s -> 6193.22s]  Thursday at midnight.
[6194.29s -> 6197.49s]  And then make sure it is a YouTube link.
[6198.83s -> 6201.31s]  Check the rules and the pinned message there.
[6201.31s -> 6202.19s]  And follow them all.
[6203.20s -> 6204.88s]  Because if you do not follow those rules,
[6204.88s -> 6207.04s]  then your submission is not going to be
[6207.04s -> 6208.24s]  put in or considered.
[6209.74s -> 6211.26s]  Please follow the rules.
[6211.90s -> 6215.42s]  Thank you.
[6217.57s -> 6218.21s]  Asian Turtle.
[6218.21s -> 6219.01s]  Thanks for the $1.
[6219.01s -> 6220.13s]  I made this while I was waiting
[6220.13s -> 6220.85s]  for the stream to start.
[6220.85s -> 6222.05s]  And while you spent the next hour
[6222.05s -> 6223.97s]  building an enclosure for your beavers.
[6229.23s -> 6230.11s]  From the...
[6234.35s -> 6239.44s]  Oh man.
[6239.44s -> 6240.32s]  They bought a zoo.
[6240.96s -> 6242.43s]  Thank you for the $1.
[6248.42s -> 6249.30s]  Major Bluetooth.
[6249.30s -> 6249.94s]  Thanks for the $5.
[6251.62s -> 6252.18s]  Hey Jerma.
[6252.18s -> 6253.30s]  Really enjoyed the latest installment
[6253.30s -> 6254.26s]  into the rumble cannon.
[6254.34s -> 6256.26s]  And wanted to leave a cheer in its honor.
[6256.82s -> 6257.54s]  Brought the great laugh.
[6257.54s -> 6259.78s]  Since the rumble did not have a U.S. president,
[6259.78s -> 6261.38s]  I took your advice and imagined
[6261.38s -> 6264.58s]  the green screen to be William H. Taft.
[6264.58s -> 6265.78s]  Our 27th.
[6265.78s -> 6268.98s]  What a treat it was for our first U.S. president.
[6268.98s -> 6270.66s]  To get our first U.S. president victory
[6270.66s -> 6271.70s]  after such an epic struggle.
[6272.26s -> 6274.50s]  And then watch him honor his own legacy
[6274.50s -> 6277.38s]  by getting stuck on the rope.
[6278.02s -> 6278.82s]  Also juicy.
[6279.46s -> 6284.77s]  Thank you Major Bluetooth for the $5.
[6284.77s -> 6286.77s]  For that juicy five bucks.
[6287.41s -> 6294.22s]  Juicy fruit.
[6294.22s -> 6297.62s]  But yeah, it could have been anybody.
[6298.18s -> 6299.14s]  That's why he's too powerful.
[6299.78s -> 6301.92s]  He will never return.
[6302.72s -> 6305.68s]  Until I do a champion's brawl.
[6306.24s -> 6308.66s]  Which you could probably imagine what that means.
[6310.32s -> 6310.96s]  Swiggity dank.
[6310.96s -> 6312.24s]  Thanks for the $20.
[6312.24s -> 6313.36s]  Swiggity dank.
[6313.36s -> 6316.82s]  Hey Jerma just got out of the hospital
[6316.82s -> 6321.12s]  from getting surgery on my nuts.
[6322.53s -> 6324.53s]  It doesn't feel too great as you can imagine.
[6324.53s -> 6325.33s]  But I'm all right.
[6325.33s -> 6327.33s]  And this stream is helping me keep my mind off of it.
[6327.33s -> 6327.89s]  Thanks man.
[6329.76s -> 6334.03s]  Um, yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
[6334.03s -> 6334.91s]  Dude, hope you're okay.
[6337.81s -> 6338.53s]  Thanks for the $20.
[6339.33s -> 6344.54s]  Hopefully you recover quickly
[6344.54s -> 6345.98s]  and hopefully it's nothing serious.
[6346.62s -> 6349.47s]  Take care of yourself.
[6349.47s -> 6353.57s]  Thanks for the $20.
[6354.45s -> 6357.12s]  Hey dragon breath, thanks for the $1.
[6357.12s -> 6359.34s]  Hey Jerma, in case you haven't seen,
[6359.34s -> 6362.46s]  Joel addressed that thing about the dog smell question
[6362.46s -> 6364.06s]  that happened during the Labo stream.
[6364.62s -> 6366.78s]  You should listen to this with chat for a few minutes.
[6366.78s -> 6368.14s]  This is a VOD link.
[6368.70s -> 6373.22s]  It's fucking dog smell.
[6373.78s -> 6374.82s]  Hey, thanks a lot.
[6375.70s -> 6377.22s]  By the way, by the way,
[6377.22s -> 6379.06s]  that's a rare kind of anecdote here.
[6382.11s -> 6385.25s]  Now, I don't know if this is the right place
[6385.25s -> 6386.13s]  to talk about this.
[6388.21s -> 6391.01s]  But I know that Jerma hosted me.
[6391.65s -> 6392.53s]  Oh, he didn't host me.
[6392.53s -> 6395.01s]  He was doing like a little joke on stream.
[6395.73s -> 6397.25s]  And I want to say I was,
[6397.25s -> 6398.85s]  I was being a bit of an asshole,
[6398.85s -> 6400.61s]  a no fun asshole because like.
[6400.61s -> 6401.09s]  Wait, what?
[6401.09s -> 6402.37s]  No, he wasn't, was he?
[6402.37s -> 6403.17s]  I don't remember that.
[6404.13s -> 6406.94s]  No, that didn't.
[6407.34s -> 6410.43s]  Here's the, here's the deal.
[6410.43s -> 6412.59s]  What happened last Gregory horror show stream.
[6413.39s -> 6416.27s]  Jerma was going around and I don't fully like
[6416.27s -> 6417.95s]  get the, the, the brunt of this joke, right?
[6418.51s -> 6421.15s]  But he was going around and he was like
[6421.15s -> 6422.43s]  having a little bit of fun, right?
[6423.07s -> 6426.59s]  And, uh, he was, he was having fun with,
[6426.59s -> 6428.03s]  uh, all these streamers, right?
[6428.67s -> 6431.31s]  And then, uh, somebody suggested
[6431.31s -> 6432.75s]  he should like do the thing for me.
[6432.75s -> 6435.07s]  And it was like some, some sort of like weird
[6436.03s -> 6438.75s]  raid question about dogs or something like that.
[6439.47s -> 6441.23s]  And he did it to several people,
[6441.23s -> 6452.82s]  but when it came to me, I was like,
[6453.30s -> 6464.38s]  like technical issues at the same time.
[6465.02s -> 6466.70s]  And I was like getting back and forth
[6466.70s -> 6468.38s]  support from chat or something like that.
[6468.38s -> 6469.58s]  I can't fully remember what happened,
[6469.58s -> 6471.42s]  but, uh, and in the midst of this,
[6472.14s -> 6474.78s]  a bunch of like Jerma viewers bled onto
[6474.78s -> 6476.30s]  my stream and started asking questions.
[6476.94s -> 6479.18s]  And I kind of was like a bit of an asshole about it.
[6479.18s -> 6480.46s]  I started saying like,
[6480.46s -> 6482.54s]  hey, I really appreciate you guys like Beeman,
[6482.54s -> 6484.38s]  but like I'm trying to figure shit out here.
[6485.02s -> 6487.66s]  And Jerma felt so fucking bad.
[6487.66s -> 6488.16s]  I did.
[6488.70s -> 6489.42s]  I really did.
[6489.42s -> 6490.54s]  For like a good solid hour.
[6492.06s -> 6495.82s]  Basically saying, hey guys, like be chill.
[6495.82s -> 6498.62s]  And like, I really did feel so bad for like
[6499.26s -> 6500.06s]  not playing along.
[6501.58s -> 6503.18s]  Just to like make sure here,
[6503.18s -> 6505.58s]  like I have no absolute, no bad fucking
[6506.54s -> 6510.30s]  blog between Jerma and I is a super cool guy.
[6510.30s -> 6511.50s]  And I got to say this too,
[6511.50s -> 6515.10s]  the fact that he apologized and he was like,
[6515.10s -> 6517.58s]  guys, just chill out that that shows respect.
[6518.38s -> 6521.02s]  And, uh, I'm fine with playing along with stuff like that,
[6521.02s -> 6522.70s]  but just the fact that he did apologize for it,
[6522.70s -> 6524.22s]  because there's a lot of people that are like,
[6524.22s -> 6526.54s]  they don't give a shit what their audience does
[6526.54s -> 6527.42s]  or this chat does.
[6527.42s -> 6528.62s]  And the fact that he stepped out of the way
[6528.62s -> 6530.54s]  to like kind of not police his chat,
[6530.54s -> 6533.42s]  but you say, you know, calm down, you know,
[6533.42s -> 6534.70s]  I appreciate that, you know,
[6534.70s -> 6538.06s]  so, uh, you know, call me, call me,
[6538.14s -> 6542.22s]  Jerma, we can get into all kinds of weird,
[6542.22s -> 6543.98s]  uh, stinky role play if you want.
[6549.38s -> 6550.26s]  Nah, that's all good.
[6552.62s -> 6553.34s]  He's a good dude.
[6560.53s -> 6562.53s]  I wasn't under the impression that there was any
[6563.33s -> 6563.89s]  problem at all.
[6563.89s -> 6565.25s]  I just want to, you know, I mean,
[6565.25s -> 6566.53s]  because sometimes the people,
[6568.61s -> 6570.45s]  I was kind of losing my mind on stream
[6570.45s -> 6571.97s]  and we were going like, he's right.
[6571.97s -> 6574.13s]  We were bouncing around to different places
[6574.13s -> 6576.61s]  and critical started throwing cards at me
[6577.41s -> 6579.65s]  and ran into italics's stream and, you know,
[6579.65s -> 6582.27s]  we were just having fun and, uh,
[6582.27s -> 6584.11s]  but I think if you like trying to get shit done,
[6585.23s -> 6586.43s]  if you have something going on
[6586.43s -> 6587.63s]  and you're trying to figure out something
[6587.63s -> 6588.51s]  and all of a sudden it's like,
[6589.31s -> 6590.75s]  you kind of like what the hell
[6590.75s -> 6592.11s]  he's supposed to do it at that point, right?
[6596.77s -> 6602.02s]  But no, there's, it's all good.
[6602.58s -> 6604.51s]  He's a great dude.
[6608.27s -> 6611.07s]  Drunk Labo stream like strikes again.
[6622.21s -> 6624.21s]  You drank 400 glasses of wine.
[6625.47s -> 6632.77s]  Hey, but anyways, uh, yeah, that's that.
[6632.77s -> 6639.86s]  And, uh, did I, yeah, extra cheesy gave $13
[6641.28s -> 6643.44s]  to ask about my favorite animal.
[6643.44s -> 6645.68s]  And I said, I wanted a laptop or something.
[6645.68s -> 6647.36s]  I don't remember, but thank you so much.
[6647.36s -> 6648.72s]  Extra cheesy for the 13 bucks.
[6649.68s -> 6651.12s]  Armadillo was the correct answer,
[6653.55s -> 6654.19s]  but thank you.
[6655.17s -> 6657.33s]  Extra cheesy again came in with $3
[6657.33s -> 6658.85s]  on your next German craft playthrough.
[6658.85s -> 6660.21s]  You need to make a creeper zoo.
[6660.93s -> 6668.50s]  Thank you.
[6668.50s -> 6670.02s]  Thank you, Dr. Garbage and friends
[6670.02s -> 6670.58s]  for the $1.
[6670.58s -> 6671.86s]  Hey Jeremy, you should play the
[6671.86s -> 6674.50s]  re-release Spyro and ruin my childhood.
[6675.22s -> 6678.22s]  I don't want to ruin your child.
[6678.22s -> 6678.78s]  What's wrong with it?
[6678.78s -> 6679.82s]  Is the new Spyro not good?
[6680.46s -> 6681.42s]  I heard, I thought it was good,
[6682.14s -> 6685.84s]  but thank you.
[6686.66s -> 6690.18s]  Thank you, uh, 9e for the $1.
[6691.49s -> 6693.33s]  Name the restrooms after chat.
[6697.23s -> 6698.83s]  Smelly boy, thanks for $1.
[6698.83s -> 6707.63s]  Please say zoo-we-mama three times fast.
[6707.63s -> 6708.43s]  I bet you can't.
[6712.51s -> 6713.23s]  I'm not going to do that.
[6713.79s -> 6718.34s]  Hold on.
[6718.34s -> 6719.70s]  I'm mute my microphone for a second.
[6729.41s -> 6729.97s]  I don't get it.
[6730.69s -> 6734.80s]  I don't understand.
[6734.80s -> 6747.89s]  This is, this is a meme.
[6747.89s -> 6748.37s]  Don't worry.
[6748.37s -> 6749.01s]  Okay, fine.
[6749.73s -> 6750.77s]  We don't do memes here.
[6751.57s -> 6753.01s]  Hey Garfield, the Monday killer.
[6753.01s -> 6753.89s]  Thanks for the $1.
[6753.89s -> 6754.37s]  Ho, ho, ho.
[6754.37s -> 6755.41s]  It's almost that time of year again.
[6755.41s -> 6757.17s]  Wonder what you want for Christmas.
[6757.17s -> 6758.29s]  I can't finish a movie.
[6759.25s -> 6761.65s]  I can't finish a movie in for the stream.
[6762.37s -> 6763.97s]  The movie stream since I got finals soon,
[6763.97s -> 6765.33s]  but the German cinematic universe
[6766.05s -> 6767.65s]  has not yet halted production.
[6768.21s -> 6769.89s]  Odie, watch what you're doing.
[6769.89s -> 6771.97s]  That boom mic cost a whole $30.
[6771.97s -> 6773.41s]  What a crazy dog.
[6773.41s -> 6775.09s]  I bet Otto doesn't do stuff like that.
[6775.09s -> 6776.05s]  Don't drop that.
[6776.05s -> 6777.33s]  You're fired.
[6777.33s -> 6778.93s]  Congratulations on another awesome Germania.
[6778.93s -> 6780.29s]  You always put so much work.
[6780.29s -> 6781.49s]  Did you just drop it, Odie?
[6789.22s -> 6790.58s]  Thank you for the $1 Garfield.
[6791.30s -> 6792.37s]  Appreciate it.
[6793.49s -> 6794.13s]  Barfield.
[6794.13s -> 6794.93s]  I'm going to, you know,
[6794.93s -> 6796.93s]  your name now is Barfield.
[6798.19s -> 6798.75s]  Barfield.
[6804.86s -> 6806.78s]  I just quantum died.
[6814.46s -> 6815.90s]  I'm going to remember Barfield.
[6816.54s -> 6818.80s]  Barfield is going to have like
[6818.80s -> 6820.16s]  puke on his face and be green.
[6821.42s -> 6823.42s]  All right, quantum dead.
[6826.19s -> 6827.55s]  Thank you, Garfield, for the $1.
[6831.68s -> 6832.80s]  Hey, Pilot Guy.
[6832.80s -> 6835.36s]  Thank you, Pilot Guy, for the $20, Pilot Guy.
[6835.92s -> 6837.33s]  Hey, German, just want to say thank you
[6837.33s -> 6838.85s]  for all the laughs through my times of stress.
[6838.85s -> 6840.29s]  You've always been here and helped me smile.
[6840.29s -> 6840.77s]  Thank you.
[6840.77s -> 6841.25s]  Thank you.
[6842.29s -> 6844.21s]  Thank you, Pilot Guy, for your $20
[6844.93s -> 6847.17s]  and for being here.
[6848.29s -> 6854.18s]  More importantly, thank you so much.
[6855.62s -> 6857.70s]  Bake Me Home, thanks for $13.
[6857.70s -> 6859.54s]  It's a good thing you're streaming
[6859.54s -> 6861.94s]  because I dread to live in a world
[6861.94s -> 6863.70s]  where you actually ran an amusement park.
[6864.42s -> 6865.46s]  German land.
[6865.46s -> 6868.80s]  It's a good thing it's just a stream.
[6868.80s -> 6871.66s]  I think I would do a pretty good job.
[6882.22s -> 6883.02s]  You laugh now.
[6884.42s -> 6886.10s]  But thank you.
[6886.10s -> 6886.98s]  Thank you, Bake Me Home.
[6886.98s -> 6888.42s]  Thank you, Pilot Guy.
[6888.42s -> 6889.70s]  $20, $13.
[6891.33s -> 6893.81s]  Flabjack, thanks for the $2, Flabjack.
[6894.37s -> 6895.97s]  When are you going to give us comedy lessons?
[6895.97s -> 6897.41s]  I'm looking forward to that stream,
[6897.41s -> 6898.21s]  funny streamer.
[6898.77s -> 6902.51s]  Comedy lessons.
[6904.77s -> 6905.98s]  I don't know.
[6906.46s -> 6907.26s]  When is that going to happen?
[6907.26s -> 6910.90s]  Who knows?
[6910.90s -> 6911.38s]  Thank you.
[6912.64s -> 6919.20s]  Thank you, Bunny Butt, for the $1, $2, $3, $4, $5 here.
[6919.76s -> 6920.32s]  Bunny Butt.
[6921.26s -> 6924.22s]  How does one go about making stupid camera jokes?
[6924.22s -> 6926.46s]  I'm hoping for advice from my own streams.
[6929.47s -> 6930.59s]  Stupid camera jokes.
[6931.23s -> 6934.34s]  How many bits do I have to spend to name him Skateboard?
[6938.18s -> 6941.38s]  Well, I didn't make him have any name.
[6944.70s -> 6945.90s]  But stupid camera jokes.
[6945.90s -> 6946.38s]  I don't...
[6947.47s -> 6952.94s]  Get a camera and do the default Fortnite dance in front of it.
[6952.94s -> 6954.62s]  And then have a green screen behind you
[6954.62s -> 6961.68s]  and like key yourself into like a genie bottle or something.
[6961.68s -> 6967.20s]  And then when the person rubs you out of the bottle,
[6967.20s -> 6969.92s]  of the bottle, of the bottle, of the genie bottle,
[6969.92s -> 6972.48s]  when you come out of the genie bottle,
[6972.48s -> 6974.80s]  you can like give them like a hundred,
[6974.80s -> 6977.20s]  never mind, moving on, a hundred wee bucks.
[6977.60s -> 6980.32s]  Not wee, like Nintendo wee.
[6980.32s -> 6980.96s]  Vee bucks.
[6981.60s -> 6990.37s]  That threw me off so bad because of the stupid shit that I just said.
[6990.37s -> 6991.33s]  But thank you, Bunny Butt.
[6993.07s -> 6994.27s]  Sorry, I didn't name him Skateboard.
[6996.32s -> 6997.60s]  Severian, the great.
[6997.60s -> 6999.92s]  Thanks for your $11, Severian.
[6999.92s -> 7003.20s]  Thank you so much.
[7003.20s -> 7004.08s]  No message.
[7004.08s -> 7006.32s]  Just $11 fucking dollars.
[7006.32s -> 7006.64s]  Thank you.
[7007.36s -> 7009.49s]  Thank you so much.
[7009.49s -> 7011.65s]  Hater the Tater for the $5.
[7011.65s -> 7017.14s]  Actually, more like $11 here from Hater the Tater.
[7018.66s -> 7020.98s]  Jar Jar with fun size is Jerjer.
[7021.62s -> 7022.58s]  Jerjer.
[7022.58s -> 7025.98s]  That gets an e-heave from me.
[7025.98s -> 7027.26s]  That gets an e-heave from me.
[7028.53s -> 7030.85s]  Also, stream is now middle-aged, rocky, and unstable,
[7030.85s -> 7032.53s]  but still going like Jerma.
[7032.53s -> 7034.93s]  You're not middle-aged until you're like 45 or 50 years old.
[7034.93s -> 7035.33s]  I'm fine.
[7035.33s -> 7036.37s]  I'm doing just good enough.
[7037.76s -> 7038.96s]  Thank you for your $11.
[7038.96s -> 7040.70s]  Appreciate it.
[7040.70s -> 7042.38s]  That gets a little bit of an e-heave from me.
[7042.38s -> 7043.26s]  You know what I'm saying?
[7043.26s -> 7045.17s]  Mostly lost.
[7045.17s -> 7047.09s]  Thanks for the $2 here.
[7047.09s -> 7048.61s]  I liked Just Cause 3 a lot.
[7048.61s -> 7051.57s]  I think it would be a great game to play.
[7051.57s -> 7052.75s]  Jerma game.
[7055.17s -> 7057.41s]  Yeah, I mean, I'm going to give it a try.
[7057.97s -> 7063.63s]  Just Cause 4 comes out in like 6.
[7068.29s -> 7073.26s]  EDF 5 comes out in less than a week and a half.
[7077.04s -> 7078.24s]  Oh, shit.
[7083.34s -> 7084.38s]  Wow, I forgot about that.
[7085.52s -> 7088.56s]  Earth Defense Force 5 comes out on PlayStation 4.
[7089.28s -> 7090.16s]  December 10th?
[7090.16s -> 7090.80s]  December 11th?
[7093.41s -> 7096.13s]  Well, you bet your ass you know what we're doing
[7096.13s -> 7098.29s]  on the 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[7098.29s -> 7104.62s]  It's going to be that.
[7110.37s -> 7110.93s]  But thank you.
[7110.93s -> 7112.05s]  Again, mostly lost.
[7112.05s -> 7113.49s]  And it's got the right balance of fun,
[7113.49s -> 7115.97s]  gameplay, and mechanics with a laughably bad story.
[7115.97s -> 7117.09s]  That's Just Cause 3.
[7120.26s -> 7123.78s]  I remember Star made a video on Just Cause 3.
[7125.60s -> 7126.80s]  Looked pretty ridiculous.
[7126.80s -> 7129.90s]  So definitely kind of up my alley.
[7133.17s -> 7133.81s]  Sputa.
[7133.81s -> 7134.53s]  Thanks for the $1.
[7134.53s -> 7137.25s]  I'm sorry I can only go for small bits this time.
[7137.25s -> 7138.85s]  But considering you get so many bit messages,
[7138.85s -> 7140.85s]  I'm sure it gets difficult to remember them all.
[7140.85s -> 7143.09s]  But do you ever think back to messages from long ago,
[7143.81s -> 7145.97s]  rather as a pick-me-up or just in general?
[7147.94s -> 7150.02s]  Um, stuff sticks with me.
[7150.02s -> 7150.42s]  It does.
[7151.68s -> 7154.00s]  It can be, like you said, it can be very difficult though.
[7154.80s -> 7159.28s]  Trying to bring back the memories of donation messages
[7159.28s -> 7160.24s]  or bit messages.
[7160.24s -> 7164.50s]  And I try my best to keep, you know,
[7165.62s -> 7167.06s]  as many as I can fit up there.
[7170.58s -> 7172.42s]  But that's, it gets hard.
[7173.63s -> 7175.79s]  It's just that I never want to be one of those people
[7175.79s -> 7176.83s]  that's just like, thanks for the dollar.
[7176.83s -> 7177.63s]  Thanks for five bucks.
[7177.63s -> 7178.03s]  Bye bye.
[7178.03s -> 7178.35s]  Thank you.
[7178.35s -> 7178.67s]  Thank bye.
[7178.67s -> 7179.31s]  Thanks for the money.
[7180.96s -> 7182.40s]  But it is a challenge.
[7182.40s -> 7185.66s]  Do you talk to yourself while playing games offline too?
[7185.66s -> 7190.18s]  Yes, I do.
[7190.18s -> 7196.32s]  Like the one where I made you cry.
[7197.12s -> 7204.69s]  Yeah, I mean, you guys, it's,
[7206.45s -> 7207.89s]  I don't just take it lightly, you know?
[7209.25s -> 7211.89s]  Some of you guys have given a lot of fucking money.
[7211.89s -> 7213.73s]  A lot of money, a lot of time,
[7213.73s -> 7214.77s]  a lot of your free time.
[7216.34s -> 7218.18s]  And there are lots of, here's the thing, right?
[7218.82s -> 7221.78s]  The reason why I want to care so much about this
[7221.86s -> 7227.06s]  and take it as, try as hard as I can on certain scenarios
[7227.06s -> 7228.34s]  and try to come up with things to do
[7228.34s -> 7230.42s]  is because there are so many other avenues
[7230.42s -> 7231.54s]  for you to use your free time.
[7233.55s -> 7236.99s]  Thousands of people, hundreds of shows,
[7236.99s -> 7239.63s]  thousands and thousands of avenues for entertainment.
[7241.74s -> 7244.86s]  It means an absolute metric shitload
[7245.82s -> 7248.22s]  that out of all the possible places, you're here.
[7249.68s -> 7252.24s]  So I have to take it fucking seriously
[7252.24s -> 7256.24s]  because that's a huge, huge, huge thing.
[7266.83s -> 7268.27s]  And I'm going to do it for as long as I can,
[7271.78s -> 7272.74s]  as long as I'm having fun
[7273.30s -> 7275.06s]  and can keep coming up with stuff I'd like to do.
[7275.78s -> 7278.74s]  I don't want to get to that position where it's like,
[7279.38s -> 7282.66s]  I'm just doing it just to do it because I,
[7282.66s -> 7284.50s]  because I'm going to because that's what I do
[7284.50s -> 7285.30s]  and I'm just going to do it.
[7286.82s -> 7287.86s]  No, I don't want to do that.
[7290.48s -> 7292.56s]  Until 40, when I can't say swears anymore.
[7292.56s -> 7293.04s]  That's, yeah.
[7300.78s -> 7307.06s]  It's true, you can't, but thank you.
[7307.54s -> 7308.66s]  Thank you, Sputa.
[7309.92s -> 7311.76s]  Thank you, Pancakes for the $1.
[7311.76s -> 7313.20s]  Just want to say you smell like a shoe.
[7313.20s -> 7314.48s]  I really appreciate all your content.
[7314.48s -> 7314.96s]  Keep it up.
[7314.96s -> 7315.92s]  Let me see.
[7315.92s -> 7318.42s]  Now that's Dove Men Plus Care.
[7322.62s -> 7324.30s]  Fucking Walmart brand.
[7326.00s -> 7326.64s]  Thank you, Pancakes.
[7326.64s -> 7328.24s]  Thank you, Twitchy Pyro for the $1.
[7328.24s -> 7329.60s]  Jerma, thanks for providing a good laugh
[7329.60s -> 7330.32s]  while I try to figure out
[7330.32s -> 7333.12s]  how to get out of this walk-in oven.
[7333.12s -> 7333.84s]  I'll keep at it.
[7334.72s -> 7336.72s]  Try banging on the door and saying, hey,
[7337.52s -> 7339.52s]  somebody will go up the fuck and open it probably.
[7341.82s -> 7342.46s]  Thank you.
[7342.46s -> 7344.37s]  Thank you, DubskiDude for the $1.
[7344.37s -> 7345.49s]  Hey, Jerma, I've been a fan of your content
[7345.49s -> 7348.53s]  since kindergarten how time flies.
[7348.53s -> 7351.65s]  I'm already a great grandfather and on my deathbed.
[7351.65s -> 7353.33s]  I remember the smoke signal streams
[7353.33s -> 7355.01s]  you used to do with the pilgrims.
[7355.01s -> 7355.89s]  Good times, man.
[7355.89s -> 7357.73s]  And let's not forget how you goofed
[7357.73s -> 7359.17s]  on the Mesopotamians.
[7359.17s -> 7361.17s]  Their civilization wasn't the same after that one.
[7362.21s -> 7364.85s]  Can't wait for another 6.7 million years
[7365.41s -> 7366.61s]  of quality streams.
[7366.61s -> 7368.85s]  Keep it up, you timeless streamer boy.
[7389.65s -> 7390.53s]  Thank you, DubskiDude.
[7392.22s -> 7393.10s]  Thank you for the $1.
[7394.06s -> 7396.14s]  And we're going for another 7 million years.
[7397.02s -> 7398.06s]  They're going to figure it out.
[7398.06s -> 7399.26s]  They'll figure out like robotics
[7399.26s -> 7401.58s]  and I'll be able to put like an implant in my chest.
[7409.54s -> 7412.02s]  Thank you, SpicyMexicanTaco for the $1.
[7412.66s -> 7415.70s]  Thank you, $5.
[7416.83s -> 7418.27s]  Dr. Clay for the $1.
[7418.99s -> 7421.87s]  Just want to say I hate the menu in WWE2K19.
[7422.59s -> 7424.51s]  It's just white background with gray text
[7424.51s -> 7426.03s]  that says the menu selection.
[7426.03s -> 7428.27s]  The UI literally looks like a placeholder.
[7431.94s -> 7432.34s]  I know.
[7433.06s -> 7434.02s]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[7435.63s -> 7438.19s]  All the menus in these WWE games lately.
[7441.15s -> 7442.83s]  Just awful.
[7445.25s -> 7446.85s]  Even the character creator,
[7446.85s -> 7450.29s]  there's a menu for a menu inside of a menu to get to,
[7450.29s -> 7452.29s]  okay, you want to change somebody's hair.
[7452.29s -> 7455.49s]  Click on, okay, you got to go to body,
[7455.49s -> 7458.29s]  a lot of appearance, facial appearances,
[7458.29s -> 7459.57s]  and then the hair and then it's just,
[7459.57s -> 7461.41s]  there's like four menus.
[7462.13s -> 7464.56s]  There's so many menus that just stacked
[7464.56s -> 7465.84s]  on top of each other.
[7465.84s -> 7471.41s]  I would really much rather,
[7471.41s -> 7473.73s]  and I don't know why they don't do this.
[7473.73s -> 7474.45s]  I don't understand.
[7475.78s -> 7480.18s]  Wrestling is not like baseball or football or...
[7483.30s -> 7483.86s]  Don't worry.
[7484.50s -> 7487.38s]  Sheamus is still going to exist in 2020.
[7487.38s -> 7487.94s]  You know what I mean?
[7490.69s -> 7492.69s]  They're turning it into this roster update
[7492.69s -> 7494.61s]  where they add a handful of features.
[7496.13s -> 7498.05s]  It's not like, oh, every single year,
[7499.09s -> 7501.25s]  hundreds and hundreds of people change teams.
[7504.03s -> 7505.71s]  And you could argue that that could just be done
[7505.71s -> 7507.95s]  with something as simple as a patch, right?
[7515.84s -> 7517.36s]  Wrestling isn't real, so...
[7518.32s -> 7519.92s]  Well, I mean, there's the aspect of like
[7519.92s -> 7522.32s]  the fantasy kind of fiction aspect to it, yeah.
[7524.06s -> 7528.72s]  But I don't know why they have to come up
[7528.72s -> 7529.76s]  with one every single year.
[7532.66s -> 7533.78s]  It doesn't need to happen.
[7533.78s -> 7535.38s]  That didn't happen before.
[7536.50s -> 7537.86s]  That's a fairly recent thing,
[7537.86s -> 7538.90s]  the last probably 10 years.
[7539.70s -> 7542.18s]  A wrestling game would come out
[7542.18s -> 7544.58s]  when a wrestling game decided it was going to come out.
[7547.68s -> 7550.56s]  And turning the WWE franchise
[7550.64s -> 7554.08s]  into a Madden-like simulation sports game
[7554.08s -> 7557.81s]  that has to come out on a yearly schedule
[7557.81s -> 7560.69s]  is, in my opinion, is killing the whole thing.
[7560.69s -> 7561.81s]  It's killing the whole franchise.
[7565.78s -> 7567.94s]  And I would not be somebody that's...
[7567.94s -> 7569.70s]  My opinion is that's not an unpopular opinion.
[7571.44s -> 7574.88s]  All of these games over the last five, six, or seven years
[7576.16s -> 7577.44s]  is at least the last six.
[7578.16s -> 7580.40s]  With the exception of maybe one or two of them
[7580.40s -> 7585.90s]  have been pretty, I would say, very mediocre ratings and reviews.
[7585.90s -> 7587.18s]  Just like, eh, it's not special.
[7587.90s -> 7589.98s]  It's just bad and it's not very good.
[7598.16s -> 7599.60s]  It's... I don't understand.
[7606.24s -> 7608.24s]  After 2006 is when they started doing it every year,
[7608.24s -> 7610.48s]  but those early ones were still good.
[7611.28s -> 7612.08s]  So you don't know what happened.
[7612.08s -> 7614.32s]  Well, what happened is THQ was liquidated
[7615.52s -> 7618.72s]  and 2K ended up taking on the franchise.
[7618.72s -> 7625.54s]  And they turned it into the NBA, you know, NBA 2K,
[7626.34s -> 7628.18s]  WWE 2K, and, you know,
[7628.18s -> 7630.26s]  they had the teams at 2K that do sports
[7631.28s -> 7633.92s]  start to contribute to the games that, you know,
[7633.92s -> 7635.60s]  they took on the license from the WWE.
[7636.32s -> 7642.64s]  That's kind of what happened.
[7646.05s -> 7652.82s]  To be honest, like, for real, THQ may be one of the...
[7654.50s -> 7655.78s]  People, like, talked about it for a little while,
[7655.78s -> 7657.30s]  but you don't even realize just how...
[7658.18s -> 7661.15s]  That's like a pretty devastating loss to gaming.
[7661.71s -> 7665.30s]  There were some really great fucking titles
[7665.30s -> 7666.90s]  that were underneath THQ.
[7666.98s -> 7678.03s]  You can think about, oh, yeah, THQ got, like,
[7678.03s -> 7680.27s]  wiped out and liquidated and gone.
[7681.07s -> 7682.03s]  Oh, wow, that sucks.
[7682.03s -> 7682.91s]  Oh, that's too bad.
[7682.91s -> 7684.19s]  But then you realize, like,
[7684.19s -> 7685.87s]  the rippling effects that that has.
[7686.67s -> 7696.08s]  They made some pretty great games,
[7696.08s -> 7698.00s]  or at least they had enough to do with them.
[7704.77s -> 7707.65s]  But I could sit here and be sad about...
[7708.94s -> 7709.58s]  And I don't know.
[7709.58s -> 7710.70s]  Maybe I am one of those people
[7710.70s -> 7716.10s]  that's speaking from a small audience.
[7716.10s -> 7716.74s]  You know what I mean?
[7717.46s -> 7719.06s]  Because I don't know.
[7719.06s -> 7720.90s]  The reasons why I like the WWE games
[7720.90s -> 7722.42s]  is because I like to make stuff.
[7723.14s -> 7724.74s]  I like to make scenarios.
[7724.74s -> 7728.18s]  And, oh, remember in WWE 2K14,
[7728.18s -> 7729.94s]  you could actually put your characters
[7729.94s -> 7731.22s]  into, like, cutscenes?
[7733.60s -> 7735.60s]  That shit was fucking awesome.
[7735.60s -> 7739.04s]  There was like 40 or 50 different scenarios
[7739.04s -> 7740.40s]  you could put the characters in
[7740.40s -> 7741.52s]  to play out on screen.
[7744.38s -> 7746.06s]  Just to use that game, I can't,
[7747.36s -> 7749.12s]  because it just does not hold up well at all.
[7751.07s -> 7753.07s]  That game is only for PlayStation 3.
[7753.87s -> 7759.20s]  And it takes, like, 15 seconds sometimes.
[7760.22s -> 7761.34s]  20, 30 seconds.
[7762.22s -> 7764.30s]  Once you have an elaborate character designed,
[7764.30s -> 7764.78s]  it can take...
[7765.94s -> 7767.22s]  It's just so long.
[7767.22s -> 7768.42s]  It's so slow.
[7768.42s -> 7770.02s]  The menus are slow.
[7770.02s -> 7771.62s]  The creation is so slow.
[7771.62s -> 7772.90s]  It's just very outdated.
[7784.64s -> 7786.24s]  So it would take, essentially,
[7786.24s -> 7787.36s]  probably two or three times
[7787.36s -> 7791.52s]  the amount of time to make a character
[7791.52s -> 7793.36s]  than use the current-gen version.
[7800.02s -> 7801.06s]  And maybe it would be worth it,
[7801.06s -> 7802.67s]  but I don't know.
[7802.67s -> 7804.83s]  I just wish that they would...
[7805.63s -> 7808.24s]  I mean, who knows?
[7808.24s -> 7809.52s]  I don't know what the data is,
[7809.52s -> 7810.24s]  what they have,
[7810.24s -> 7812.88s]  or what people want out of a wrestling game.
[7812.88s -> 7817.49s]  But I like the crazy league aspect of it,
[7817.49s -> 7818.93s]  where people get to make their own leagues
[7818.93s -> 7820.93s]  and make their own interesting storylines.
[7820.93s -> 7824.02s]  And that's what I did
[7824.02s -> 7826.42s]  when I was 14, 15, 16.
[7827.14s -> 7828.69s]  We would make entire...
[7828.69s -> 7829.89s]  We would make entire...
[7829.89s -> 7831.01s]  Me and my friends would just sit there
[7831.01s -> 7832.77s]  and just make whole scenarios.
[7832.77s -> 7833.65s]  Make whole leagues.
[7834.37s -> 7839.34s]  We used to make our dads,
[7839.34s -> 7841.10s]  and our dads would fight each other in the ring.
[7842.43s -> 7843.95s]  And it was like all storylines
[7843.95s -> 7846.43s]  attached to each other's dads.
[7853.70s -> 7854.42s]  That's what I want.
[7863.41s -> 7864.53s]  I could care less if...
[7866.30s -> 7866.86s]  Oh, you know,
[7868.21s -> 7871.68s]  the Hulk Hogan's in this one.
[7872.32s -> 7873.89s]  That's cool.
[7873.89s -> 7874.53s]  Okay.
[7874.53s -> 7876.61s]  I can make Hulk Hogan.
[7876.61s -> 7877.81s]  I can just make him.
[7877.81s -> 7882.32s]  But I'll get off that rant.
[7887.31s -> 7888.03s]  Dad voice.
[7890.53s -> 7892.45s]  But anyways, let's wrap it up here.
[7893.73s -> 7894.61s]  Mandragor root.
[7895.25s -> 7896.21s]  Thanks for the $1.
[7897.38s -> 7898.90s]  Mazekit, thanks for the $1.
[7901.18s -> 7902.54s]  Is the new home treating you well?
[7903.26s -> 7903.50s]  Yeah.
[7904.70s -> 7907.50s]  I'd say settling in pretty nicely.
[7907.50s -> 7912.62s]  Las Vegas is an awesome place.
[7912.62s -> 7914.06s]  There's tons to do, tons to see.
[7914.86s -> 7917.46s]  So yeah, I'm loving it.
[7917.46s -> 7918.22s]  For sure.
[7920.64s -> 7922.48s]  Thank you, Burger B for the $5.
[7924.54s -> 7925.74s]  Me and a few of the Discord boys
[7925.74s -> 7927.18s]  have been trying to find the most effective way
[7927.18s -> 7928.14s]  to thaw bread.
[7928.14s -> 7929.42s]  What are your thoughts?
[7929.42s -> 7929.98s]  Keep it real.
[7931.95s -> 7933.09s]  How to thaw bread.
[7936.38s -> 7937.18s]  How frozen is it?
[7939.39s -> 7942.13s]  Is it like rock solid
[7942.13s -> 7949.68s]  or is it just slightly crystalline on the inside?
[7949.68s -> 7950.64s]  It's like an ice cube.
[7954.22s -> 7954.94s]  Well, you could.
[7957.87s -> 7959.87s]  I mean, you could just sit on it for a little while.
[7962.61s -> 7963.73s]  Just take it out.
[7963.73s -> 7966.21s]  Just sit on it like a penguin.
[7971.63s -> 7973.79s]  But make sure you have like jeans on
[7973.79s -> 7975.31s]  so it doesn't like get too cold.
[7979.10s -> 7981.18s]  My best thought was to light it on fire in a toilet.
[7981.18s -> 7982.62s]  Now that is a terrible idea.
[7984.08s -> 7986.08s]  No, put it in the microwave on thaw.
[7986.08s -> 7988.24s]  Every microwave has a thaw setting.
[7988.24s -> 7989.84s]  You just have to look at the manual.
[7989.84s -> 7992.72s]  Look at the instructional manual of your microwave
[7992.72s -> 7994.48s]  and it'll be a thaw setting.
[7994.48s -> 7996.16s]  Thaw it maybe a minute or two.
[7996.16s -> 7996.96s]  Check it.
[7996.96s -> 7997.68s]  Is it spongy?
[7997.68s -> 7999.28s]  No, put it back in the other thaw setting.
[8001.66s -> 8003.74s]  Why would you sit naked on bread?
[8003.74s -> 8004.46s]  I didn't say that.
[8004.46s -> 8006.54s]  That's why I said wear a pair of jeans.
[8011.57s -> 8014.29s]  Microwaving bread sounds like the saddest thing in the world.
[8023.81s -> 8024.93s]  There's no reason to do that.
[8025.33s -> 8026.37s]  If you get a piece of bread.
[8026.37s -> 8027.65s]  Oh, I'm gonna make like a sandwich.
[8029.14s -> 8031.22s]  Just stick it in there and just put for 30 seconds.
[8031.22s -> 8032.02s]  That'd be awful.
[8038.86s -> 8040.62s]  It would turn into shit.
[8040.62s -> 8042.46s]  It would be so sloppy.
[8042.46s -> 8043.58s]  It would just pull apart.
[8048.46s -> 8049.50s]  Set it to defrost.
[8049.50s -> 8050.22s]  Yeah.
[8050.22s -> 8058.98s]  Am I gonna play Kingdom Hearts 3 when it comes out?
[8060.30s -> 8061.02s]  I don't know.
[8061.66s -> 8062.22s]  I don't know.
[8063.50s -> 8064.70s]  Probably not on stream.
[8066.40s -> 8067.36s]  I don't think so.
[8068.00s -> 8070.42s]  I feel like there's really only one way.
[8071.30s -> 8073.62s]  Here's how I decide if it's something I want to stream.
[8074.42s -> 8078.64s]  When there's really only one way to complete and play through a game,
[8080.69s -> 8082.85s]  I'm not like that interested in streaming it.
[8083.49s -> 8085.25s]  And I say that for one reason because
[8086.21s -> 8089.23s]  I don't know if you watch a Kingdom Hearts stream that's,
[8089.87s -> 8091.39s]  you know, pointed every direction.
[8091.39s -> 8094.11s]  If you're, oh, I'm in the Kingdom Hearts 3 directory.
[8094.11s -> 8094.43s]  Okay.
[8095.23s -> 8098.50s]  All of us here are doing the same thing.
[8098.50s -> 8100.10s]  We're seeing the same cutscenes.
[8100.10s -> 8101.78s]  We're seeing the same story.
[8101.78s -> 8103.30s]  And I got the same keyblade.
[8104.32s -> 8106.00s]  There's not very much difference between them.
[8110.61s -> 8112.77s]  You want to reenact Kingdom Hearts on stream.
[8115.65s -> 8116.37s]  I can't do that either.
[8116.37s -> 8117.09s]  I don't know the script.
[8119.89s -> 8121.25s]  But that's just not, I don't,
[8121.25s -> 8123.09s]  that's how I determine if it's something I want to stream.
[8126.03s -> 8128.59s]  How different is my experience going to be from the person
[8128.59s -> 8130.59s]  that's potentially right next to me?
[8132.91s -> 8136.43s]  Is there enough there that makes it fun enough, different enough?
[8137.15s -> 8142.54s]  I'm sure it's going to be a great game.
[8151.63s -> 8152.35s]  I don't know.
[8152.35s -> 8156.54s]  But with that, thank you, Elizabeth, for the $1.
[8156.54s -> 8157.26s]  Germa Defoe.
[8157.90s -> 8160.13s]  And here come the credits.
[8160.99s -> 8163.63s]  Thank you for joining me on this just hang out,
[8163.63s -> 8164.83s]  relaxed, chill stream.
[8167.49s -> 8168.61s]  I had a good time.
[8168.61s -> 8171.17s]  You know, I was like really chill tonight.
[8171.17s -> 8171.89s]  Don't you think?
[8171.89s -> 8172.53s]  Don't you think so?
[8178.51s -> 8179.87s]  You guys, were you guys relaxed?
[8182.43s -> 8184.59s]  Making like dinosaurs and shit, walking around.
[8187.42s -> 8189.34s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[8189.34s -> 8192.56s]  Should check out Zoo Tycoon 1.
[8192.56s -> 8194.16s]  Actually, that's what I'm going to do when the stream turns off.
[8194.88s -> 8204.50s]  But thank you to all the subs, everyone that just came in.
[8206.99s -> 8208.67s]  New subs, old subs.
[8210.38s -> 8211.26s]  There are a lot of you now.
[8214.40s -> 8216.24s]  There are a lot of subs.
[8221.60s -> 8222.88s]  Chat keeps trying to make you cry,
[8222.88s -> 8225.04s]  but maybe you should make chat cry.
[8225.04s -> 8226.56s]  No, why would I want to do that?
[8226.56s -> 8227.44s]  I don't want to do that.
[8232.50s -> 8234.34s]  Possibility of a game show week?
[8234.34s -> 8239.60s]  Well, let's see what I haven't played.
[8247.39s -> 8248.35s]  You broke your nail.
[8249.07s -> 8249.79s]  That's not good.
[8254.03s -> 8255.71s]  Grump broke a nail.
[8256.72s -> 8260.03s]  Which one?
[8260.03s -> 8261.07s]  Germa May Cry.
[8264.64s -> 8265.28s]  Good night, pal.
[8266.00s -> 8266.88s]  I'll sub when I can.
[8266.88s -> 8269.68s]  I've been a ghost viewer for a while until I finally made my account today.
[8270.16s -> 8271.76s]  So good to interact with chat.
[8271.76s -> 8274.58s]  Well, welcome to chat.
[8275.14s -> 8281.23s]  And there's another one that just came in.
[8281.23s -> 8282.19s]  14 months there.
[8287.18s -> 8288.22s]  A hand nail.
[8289.94s -> 8291.14s]  There's one of them on the hands.
[8291.78s -> 8296.35s]  Now you got to go to the nail blacksmith.
[8298.59s -> 8301.07s]  You put your finger out and he just takes a hammer and he's just
[8307.25s -> 8309.01s]  Welcome to my Twitch chat room.
[8309.57s -> 8313.90s]  So I will see you guys tomorrow.
[8315.86s -> 8317.14s]  Red Dead Online.
[8317.78s -> 8318.90s]  Let's see if it's any good.
[8319.62s -> 8321.46s]  Otherwise, we're going to transition to like
[8322.78s -> 8324.78s]  me fucking raiding cereal boxes.
[8334.11s -> 8334.59s]  Yee-haw.
[8339.10s -> 8340.78s]  Play Jackbox with us?
[8340.78s -> 8342.22s]  Oh yeah, that's true.
[8342.22s -> 8342.94s]  All right, here's the thing.
[8342.94s -> 8345.10s]  If Red Dead Online is just like, oh, okay.
[8345.10s -> 8346.86s]  I'm like riding around and running into trees.
[8347.66s -> 8350.86s]  The random guy threw a grenade at me and it's that for like three hours or something.
[8350.86s -> 8352.30s]  We'll play Jackbox tomorrow.
[8353.10s -> 8354.22s]  That would be fun.
[8354.94s -> 8356.88s]  Yeah, why the fuck not?
[8356.88s -> 8357.28s]  Let's do it.
[8358.88s -> 8361.12s]  Or if Red Dead is good, then hold on to that.
[8361.12s -> 8362.16s]  We'll probably do that on Friday.
[8363.89s -> 8365.01s]  Yeah, fuck yeah.
[8365.01s -> 8365.57s]  Let's do that.
[8365.57s -> 8367.09s]  Let's do that like in the next couple of days.
[8370.21s -> 8371.01s]  Yeah, yeah.
[8374.54s -> 8375.66s]  No, fuck yeah.
[8375.66s -> 8376.62s]  Yeah, fuck yeah.
[8377.26s -> 8384.54s]  All right, guys.
[8385.36s -> 8385.84s]  Take care.
[8385.84s -> 8388.05s]  See you tomorrow.
[8388.05s -> 8389.82s]  Get some sleep.
[8389.82s -> 8390.86s]  Talk to you soon.
[8390.86s -> 8393.15s]  Ta-ta for now.
