[10.74s -> 15.13s]  Okay, that's better. I've been talking this whole time, by the way. I've been muted the whole time.
[17.16s -> 23.24s]  My GoXLR was not activated for some reason. Let me, let me restart that. Let me do the whole thing.
[23.24s -> 26.36s]  Let me do that entire, like, four- I was wondering what he was reacting to what I was saying.
[27.90s -> 34.70s]  What I was saying was, hi, how are you? I need a better title. Like, I was freaking out about the
[34.70s -> 39.88s]  title because the title was awful. It was like a placeholder for when I got here. But anyways,
[39.88s -> 45.32s]  people saying 420, 420. Listen, I don't, I don't let the calendar dictate when I'm gonna fucking
[45.32s -> 54.17s]  smoke, okay? I, I don't, I don't pick when I'm gonna get high based on what calendar day it is.
[54.81s -> 61.27s]  But frankly, I don't even know how to type on the keyboard right now. I have absolutely no idea
[61.27s -> 70.30s]  where I am. I'm, I'm sober as a fucking stone right now, okay? Relax. I'm not high. I'm completely
[70.30s -> 75.90s]  fine. I haven't, guys, I know that's a meme on the channel at this point. No, I'm not.
[76.54s -> 89.77s]  I don't know. This music doesn't help, by the way. Not the one you're hearing now,
[89.77s -> 99.64s]  this one. Bro, I promise, it's 420, but I haven't done anything. And yes, this is admissible in
[99.64s -> 107.86s]  whatever court you want to hold this up. Yeah. This is the background music from Monbizo.
[108.34s -> 114.98s]  Monbozo. How do you say this? Monbonzo? Bonzow? Let me pronounce, give it to me so I don't fuck
[114.98s -> 126.81s]  it up the rest of the screen. How do I say it? Monbozu. Monbozo. Monbozu. Monbozu. Monbozu.
[126.81s -> 140.95s]  Okay. I got it. Uh, but yeah. No, I'm not high on 420. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. I do think I
[140.95s -> 144.63s]  may have come up with a really cool, no, no, I need a title. Stop making, I don't want to go off
[144.63s -> 150.50s]  on a tangent or what, a title. Monbozu? What's a good title? What's, what's going to grab people?
[150.50s -> 160.02s]  What's going to grab them? How do I feel today? I feel okay. We'll see as we go on. I honestly
[160.02s -> 167.88s]  think it might've been like a seasonal thing. Over the last couple of weeks here in Vegas,
[167.88s -> 175.64s]  it's been ridiculously windy. Three or four, five days a week over the last like two and a half
[175.64s -> 181.58s]  weeks. It's been like 30, 40 plus mile per hour winds every, like every other day. I'm imagining
[181.58s -> 184.86s]  with the seasonal change and all the crazy wind, maybe it's kicked up a bunch of bullshit.
[185.50s -> 198.84s]  I don't know. Okay. How about, uh, let's drive. Does anybody really care about my titles at this
[198.84s -> 208.28s]  point? You know, like almost, almost like almost 12 years later. Imagine needing to come up with
[208.28s -> 221.61s]  like a title for your book 4,000 times. You know what I mean? I have, I have a thousand videos I've
[221.61s -> 225.93s]  uploaded on YouTube of like five plus years ago, right? Like 10, 12, 11, 12 years ago or whatever.
[226.49s -> 234.97s]  I've streamed like fucking a thousand, 2000 times. I'm talking about two to 3000 book titles.
[235.69s -> 240.04s]  They can't all be good. In fact, half of them weren't. So whatever. How about let's drive.
[242.30s -> 256.02s]  That's fine. Doesn't matter. My titles are awful anyways. Let's make it car. No, let's drive is
[256.02s -> 263.80s]  fine. Let me tweet too. Oh, also I think I've, I got something interesting. So I didn't want to be
[263.80s -> 270.01s]  late today and I had to go to the bathroom. So I think I came up with a really cool thing.
[271.42s -> 276.46s]  You can call me a weirdo if you want, but that's fine. So I, I like to have a coffee before I
[276.46s -> 280.06s]  stream. Just like a little, like an espresso or like one, just, just a coffee to get me kind of
[280.06s -> 289.91s]  going. Um, and I had to go to the bathroom really bad. So I drank an espresso while I took a shit
[289.91s -> 303.64s]  today. It was kind of cool. I kind of liked it. I don't know why. Is that like weird? I mean,
[303.64s -> 309.38s]  that's kind of weird, but like what there was, there wasn't anything wrong with it. Like one
[309.38s -> 315.67s]  of my mods just, I think freaked out. You cannot tell chat certain details of your life. It's okay.
[320.54s -> 330.92s]  You know, over the years, like I've got these great mods, right? That help out a ton.
[331.56s -> 336.04s]  There's lots of people in this community that help out that and a ton of their time, you know,
[336.04s -> 339.26s]  hitting me up about stuff and helping me do things and all this, right? They're awesome.
[340.06s -> 344.57s]  I have a, I have a manager, right? I've got a production manager. I'm starting to realize
[344.65s -> 349.05s]  that like a lot of people try like, Hey, hey, dude, dude, dude, hey, tone it down because like
[349.05s -> 356.68s]  what you just said is fucking weird. I never had this kind of feedback. I just kind of was weird
[356.68s -> 364.66s]  to you guys and everyone was, I just thought like it was normal. Community Jake will kind of give
[364.66s -> 377.14s]  me some like, Hey, did you happen to say this the other day? Yeah, don't say that. Okay. It doesn't
[377.14s -> 381.78s]  happen that often, but it happens like enough for me to realize that like, Hey, should I have told
[381.78s -> 388.84s]  everybody that I drink an espresso while I take a shit? But I'm okay. I fuck around a lot on stream.
[388.84s -> 393.40s]  I do. I tell fucking stories. We make up jokes. We make a bunch of shit up. We just have fun.
[393.40s -> 398.04s]  That's the whole point of this stream. But in between the nonsense, like I'm telling you some
[398.04s -> 405.00s]  some truths and this is true. This is not like, Oh, he's making that up for like a funny bit on
[405.00s -> 409.00s]  stream, right? A lot of times it is that you'll hear me. We go over all kinds of weird shit, right?
[409.80s -> 416.82s]  I brewed an espresso today and I shit while I drank the espresso. And I felt like I couldn't,
[416.82s -> 420.18s]  I had to tell somebody that I had couldn't lie about that. I couldn't like pretend that didn't
[420.18s -> 427.46s]  happen. I could not pretend it didn't happen. You know, I like have to confess to somebody.
[427.46s -> 431.14s]  And you guys are some of the first people that I've seen or talked to today.
[437.19s -> 447.08s]  Holly doesn't even know this. I didn't have like time to explain it. I didn't have time to tell
[447.08s -> 461.54s]  Holly this stuff. But you know, all right, so we're going to do mon bison, mon bazoo.
[464.95s -> 468.15s]  And the whole time I was doing it, I'm just waiting, just relax. I'm here all day.
[469.46s -> 475.43s]  The entire time I was doing it, I kept saying to myself, I don't know, it was almost like I was,
[475.43s -> 481.10s]  I was doing it. I was like, Oh, this is weird. But I'm doing, but I kind of, I think it's that cool.
[485.51s -> 492.47s]  I was holding the espresso cup. Cool. Cool. I had it like tilted in my left hand. I'm just
[492.47s -> 497.69s]  sitting there like acting cool. There's nobody who cares. I don't know why I was doing it.
[501.90s -> 514.79s]  Okay. Mon, I was gonna say car game, car driving game. How do you spell it? B, A, zoom. What about
[514.79s -> 534.14s]  a cigarette? B, how do you spell it? B, B what? Cigarettes on the toilet. No, I wouldn't. Okay.
[534.14s -> 539.22s]  Even if I did smoke, I would never smoke in my house or in my apartment or anything. That
[539.22s -> 543.06s]  shit. No, that builds up. And then, no, that's gross. I was smoking in a house. No, thank you.
[547.40s -> 555.18s]  Okay. Mon, nobody has told me how to spell this yet. I guess I could just look over here,
[555.18s -> 562.65s]  couldn't I? There it is. People asking, enough like fucking around. People are asking how I'm
[562.65s -> 569.43s]  doing. I'm okay. I just figured I could stream. I didn't want to, if I got up today and spent the
[569.43s -> 573.51s]  day kind of figuring out how I felt and I feel fine, then I'm not just going to be like, Oh guys,
[575.75s -> 581.10s]  I can't stream today. It would be, it would be bullshit. So, cause I told you I wanted to stream
[581.10s -> 604.41s]  today. Okay. Let's do it. All right. Real voice. Yeah. Good to go. I think we're good to go. I
[604.41s -> 612.66s]  opened the game just to see if it worked. And by the way, you get a face cam if you've done your
[612.66s -> 629.42s]  homework, which I can't, I don't, I can't confirm that you have. All right. This is Mon Bazoo.
[630.14s -> 641.56s]  So, those of you wondering what this game is, is a game where you have to fix and build a car
[641.56s -> 650.66s]  and then race the car. It's kind of like, I don't know. We'll see. What kind of shirt should I have?
[651.22s -> 663.37s]  I don't know. What color? Okay. I'm kind of a gray Andy. 80% of my wardrobe is gray and dark blue.
[663.37s -> 672.81s]  Is that okay? Let's see. How do I, is there a punch? I can go to sleep, but I don't think
[672.81s -> 679.42s]  I should probably, I shouldn't do that right now. No, I mean, unless we can confirm,
[680.71s -> 683.43s]  unless we can confirm that chat has done their homework for tomorrow,
[684.15s -> 693.27s]  I'm not turning the face cam on. I don't have any electricity. What? No water. There's no water
[693.27s -> 701.82s]  and no electricity in the house. Mods, can you do a quick poll that says, did you finish your
[701.82s -> 705.99s]  homework? And if it's more than, I'm not going to tell you the percentage that I have in my head,
[705.99s -> 713.21s]  but just run it. Cannabis packager? Calm yourself. You need to sit down to use the pack. Wait,
[713.21s -> 718.65s]  weed grinder? Oh, it's this Easter. I forgot it's a happy Easter. Isn't, was it yesterday, the day
[718.65s -> 732.78s]  before? There's E to use. There's a total of zero pack of joint close by. There's no harvest basket.
[732.78s -> 745.43s]  You want to try to roll air? Okay. Should I do the Easter stuff first? How do I stand up?
[745.43s -> 753.67s]  Should I get the Easter stuff first? Okay, so mouse scroll is to move it around.
[753.67s -> 766.38s]  Can I open the fridge? Oh shit. What's in here? I thought this was ground beef. Yeah, don't lie.
[766.38s -> 779.27s]  Seriously. Poutine and maple syrup. Maple syrup, poutine, energy, anxiety. All right. Well, let's,
[779.27s -> 799.35s]  I'm not doing that yet. Is this a Canadian game? I guess it is. Judging by that. Okay. Let's go out
[799.35s -> 814.81s]  here. This item can't be recycled. So I have a truck. Can I go in the car? What am I supposed to
[814.81s -> 842.38s]  do? Okay. Is it in drive? Where's drive? I don't, I don't know. Manual transmission guys.
[843.66s -> 849.66s]  Where's drive? This is four wheel and two wheel. Is this in drive? What is drive?
[849.66s -> 855.69s]  It's a manual. I don't know how to drive a manual. Is it the park? Oh, the parking brake was on.
[855.69s -> 882.41s]  The parking brake was on. Okay. Wait, what am I supposed to do? Okay. Um, do I have a map? You're
[882.41s -> 891.02s]  a 15 year old. I did not, I guys, I drive, I drive a car every day. All right. You, I'm turning the
[891.02s -> 904.14s]  cam on for this. If you give a video game to your parents and you say, Hey mom, dad, I want you to
[904.14s -> 910.94s]  drive around in this car game. Okay. Your parents, even though they drive fucking like 80 hours a
[910.94s -> 917.30s]  week, whatever it is, I drive like a hundred fucking hours a week, a hundred, probably like,
[917.30s -> 922.33s]  no, way less than that. How many, okay. Like if you put like a couple of thousand miles a month
[922.33s -> 926.33s]  on a car, which is like probably like a hundred hours a month, I don't know, whatever it is,
[927.59s -> 931.90s]  you, your parents are going to sit there and go like, I don't, I don't, this just doesn't make
[931.90s -> 939.75s]  any sense to me. Uh, uh, junior, junior, how do I do this? And your fucking mother drives you
[939.75s -> 943.51s]  wherever you want, right? She, she has for years. You're my, my parents did for years.
[943.51s -> 946.55s]  They're not going to know what the fuck they're doing. They're going to have absolutely no idea
[946.55s -> 954.36s]  what to do. My dad used to, we would, when GTA three or GTA four, whatever it was, GTA three,
[955.16s -> 959.24s]  I would watch him play it and he would be sitting there going like this with the controller in his
[959.24s -> 967.35s]  hand. Like tap, tap, tap, tap. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What did I, I just hit that person and he would
[967.35s -> 973.42s]  just drive into walls and shit. And this guy, this guy like commuted every day. So come on.
[974.06s -> 994.33s]  You can't give me that much shit about this. What does a four wheel drive and get out of here?
[994.33s -> 1006.26s]  Okay. For the love of God, I don't, I don't even need this truck anyways. I don't care.
[1006.26s -> 1012.25s]  Need to reverse. I've, what does this take place in fucking Europe or something? Like,
[1012.25s -> 1019.32s]  hold on, let me see what this car is. Okay. All right. There we go. All right. Here we go.
[1019.80s -> 1035.58s]  A car reverse neutral drive. What the hell's going on in that truck? How do I not have electricity?
[1035.58s -> 1063.59s]  Hey, what does this mean? I don't know. I've never driven one of these before. So let me,
[1063.59s -> 1069.77s]  can I even, God damn it. I think I have to restart the game. Why would this, why is there a ditch
[1069.77s -> 1084.54s]  right here? I can't. Okay. What is reverse in a truck like this? Four wheel drive. This, this one,
[1085.34s -> 1096.04s]  three, two, three, four. What's, what's reverse? Three, two, one. Where is the shift?
[1096.68s -> 1113.32s]  He's a city boy. I'm honest to God. Where's reverse? Is that pedal right there? Reverse?
[1116.38s -> 1125.64s]  Oh my fucking God. Okay. I don't, what are you? It's not clearly labeled. All right. I'm just
[1125.64s -> 1141.11s]  going to go. What am I looking for? All right. Where am I right now? I have a hundred bucks.
[1143.08s -> 1159.10s]  Where am I? He's driving with his knees, crash incoming. I just don't know where I am. Do I
[1159.10s -> 1167.85s]  have an indicator on the map of where I am? Where's my house? Okay. I see the wind turbines.
[1167.85s -> 1202.15s]  How much gas do I have? Half tank. This is not even possible. What? Put it in four wheel drive.
[1202.15s -> 1226.39s]  Quick. My anxiety went up. Come on, go. All right. I'm fine. Um, sigh, another fall joke.
[1226.95s -> 1234.09s]  Okay. So that's the river. Hold on. I need to get like a better view. Should I have it in four wheel
[1234.09s -> 1261.00s]  drive and four? Well, I'm off roading right now. That's fine. This is an old German. I got,
[1261.00s -> 1269.59s]  I don't fucking know what to do. I don't know where I am in the game and I don't have any
[1269.59s -> 1289.53s]  instructions. Okay. Here's the wind and this is a road, right? All right. So this road has to be.
[1289.53s -> 1308.70s]  All right. Just stop the fucking car. Turn the fucking car off. It didn't break. Dude,
[1308.70s -> 1316.55s]  why do I have to play like fucking ping pong to put the car in park? Does this car even have a
[1316.55s -> 1337.88s]  park? Okay. I see the wind turbines. So I need, do I have like a compass? I don't know what
[1337.88s -> 1341.88s]  direction I'm facing. I'm on this road that's on that kind of right side there where the wind
[1341.88s -> 1352.63s]  turbines are. I guess I could follow the road down to go to this parfait. I'll try that. I'm
[1352.63s -> 1366.74s]  just going to follow the road. He's an automatic Andy. Okay. How many people here? There are 13,000
[1366.74s -> 1373.50s]  people here. I guarantee you. I guarantee you only like eight of you know how to drive a manual.
[1373.50s -> 1399.22s]  I'm serious. What is wrong with the car? Yeah. How many of you guys know how to drive a manual?
[1399.22s -> 1412.22s]  Fucking none of you. The parking brake is on. Oh, I didn't, did they do their homework? I didn't
[1412.22s -> 1421.94s]  even look. Did they do their homework? Okay. Here's the split. I need to go to the right or
[1421.94s -> 1448.87s]  left. I think to the left. Okay. You need to shift up, please. I got it. It's Monday at 1230.
[1453.59s -> 1470.36s]  You're going to stall out the engine. I don't drive trucks. Shift to second. Shift. I don't
[1470.36s -> 1478.71s]  want to go that fast on this road. Don't you understand? Oh shit. What's this? The brake,
[1478.71s -> 1494.02s]  please. What's going on here? Is this on the map? I need to call them. Where's my phone?
[1494.58s -> 1506.97s]  Do I have an inventory? Do I have a phone? Do I have a telephone?
[1511.08s -> 1518.20s]  What? I just spit? What the hell was that? All right. Let me look at the controls for a second
[1518.20s -> 1529.16s]  because I, there's no, I don't know what anything does. Smoke. Say sorry. Say a French slur. Spit.
[1529.16s -> 1557.30s]  I don't think I have a telephone. Can I get around this? I don't think I have a phone here.
[1557.30s -> 1565.22s]  All right. One, two. Oh, there we go. Dash is reverse. And then I have all the gears. There
[1565.22s -> 1569.22s]  we go. I don't have to look down off the road. All right. So I have, I can't go here for a while.
[1572.28s -> 1586.90s]  So let's put it in reverse. Let's get out of here. What the fuck is happening?
[1590.33s -> 1596.41s]  God damn it. I, who uses that? I guys, I haven't, I'm sorry. I'm not in a Ford commercial.
[1596.41s -> 1602.41s]  I haven't used my parking brake to park on a hill in the entire time I've ever owned an
[1602.41s -> 1617.40s]  operated vehicle. Can we get face cam back? Okay. You can. All right. So I can't go that way.
[1617.96s -> 1623.08s]  I wish there was a little blip where I was. I'm going to go back and go left.
[1623.64s -> 1629.22s]  I'm going to run out of gas too. This is going to be a disaster. Oh, what's this?
[1636.15s -> 1652.46s]  Jim's You Pull. How do I get in here? Can I get in? Is this on the map? Jim's You Pull.
[1656.14s -> 1676.92s]  It's not on the map. You're not friend enough with Jacques to get here. Oh,
[1677.08s -> 1693.53s]  well don't Jacques. Am I up there? Top right. Hit Y. I think I'm up in the top right. So if I go
[1693.53s -> 1707.18s]  this way, I should hit Parfait. I don't even know how to go home. So this is all right. So if I go,
[1707.18s -> 1712.26s]  if I just keep going this way, I'll end up at Parfait, right? I think that's what's going to
[1712.26s -> 1735.45s]  happen. Let's find out. We're in the webcam one. Okay. Do I have like an objective list?
[1739.83s -> 1747.58s]  Fucking God. I am never going to get over that. I'm going to have the parking brake on every time.
[1747.58s -> 1756.89s]  So let's keep going this way. What does the maple syrup indicator mean?
[1760.82s -> 1777.11s]  How do you look like that? Because I turn 40. Probably before you are like 25. Okay. I'm hungry.
[1777.11s -> 1796.62s]  Oh shit. Okay. There's no damage. It doesn't matter. All right. We're at a split here.
[1796.62s -> 1804.60s]  So what does this look like on the road? All right. So if I go right, I'm going to go over to
[1805.32s -> 1811.82s]  Jeve. If I go left, I'm going to go down till I hit another split and then I want to go right.
[1811.82s -> 1826.26s]  Where do I want to go? I don't even know how to get back to the house. Go to the city. Okay. So
[1826.26s -> 1835.61s]  to go to the city, I want to go left and then drive until I hit another kind of fork. And I want to
[1835.61s -> 1849.86s]  go right at the fork, right? I want to go left here, right? Please help me. You should go home
[1849.86s -> 1861.32s]  and eat. Yeah. You left here and then keep making rights. Yeah. That's what I figured. Hopefully I
[1861.32s -> 1874.60s]  have enough gas to get there. Go left and drive past two rights, then right. All right. Here it is.
[1874.60s -> 1892.42s]  Here it is. Here it is. So go keep going on. It's not on the map. Left is right. Left. And then
[1892.42s -> 1906.33s]  I can't read this map. Turn right. I think you lost, bro. I am. I just, I don't know how I even
[1906.33s -> 1928.15s]  got over here. Is that, okay. Ariette. Oh shit. It's the town right there. All right. I got it.
[1928.15s -> 1949.24s]  I got to, I got to the road. I got to the road. Right. Oh, okay. Don't be fucking idiot. It's not
[1949.24s -> 1955.22s]  a driving game. I mean it is, but you know what I mean? All right. So I made it to the town. What's
[1955.22s -> 1975.56s]  what is here? Is this where I came from? What's here? We work on the farm. Serve yourself. I got
[1975.56s -> 1989.35s]  a potato. I have a to-do. What did I get? What do you mean to-do list? How did I get a to-do list?
[1989.35s -> 2012.58s]  Curds cheese pack. Okay. Remember to pay. I think I am. I spent 20 bucks. I need gas too for my
[2012.58s -> 2027.77s]  truck. This is going to fall out. What is that thing? I think I'm good. I need a gas station.
[2027.77s -> 2053.34s]  They're still in there. All right. Gas station. What does that sign say? The cam is blocking.
[2053.34s -> 2065.77s]  Oh, where should I put it? I don't see a gas station in this town. And let me see it on the
[2065.77s -> 2081.11s]  map. I am like in that upper left quadrant, right? Oh, what's this? Can somebody like fuck the car?
[2082.44s -> 2096.70s]  Oh, post box. Do I have a mailbox? I don't think I have a mailbox. How do I get to my like to-do
[2096.70s -> 2114.39s]  list? I don't even know what that was. I quest friendships. Okay. Brother gas owner and mom. How
[2114.39s -> 2122.14s]  do I pull up-is why? How do I pull up the quest menu? Every time you clear your throat,
[2122.14s -> 2143.40s]  I'm going to play one game of Hearthstone. Snack delivery. Oh, I need to figure out how to get
[2143.40s -> 2150.44s]  back to the fucking house. You know, I'm just going to walk around because what's the point
[2150.44s -> 2166.33s]  of wasting gas? Okay. Snack delivery. Five dollars for poutine. Oh, I just ate it. All right. Cool.
[2166.33s -> 2172.87s]  So I just ate. I wish I could like fucking mark on the map where this is. I think it's the one
[2172.87s -> 2184.74s]  that's circled 10 out of 10, right? So if I'm right there, I wish I had just knew where I was,
[2184.74s -> 2193.61s]  what direction I was facing. Okay. Let's get in here. So I now need to eat or drink maple syrup.
[2193.61s -> 2215.06s]  Is that how that works? You have an, had an egg snack. Other car located. Is this a gas station?
[2215.78s -> 2223.48s]  Ooh. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I found something. How much is gas?
[2229.22s -> 2231.62s]  Weather we have today. Yes. Well, anyways, thanks for stopping by. Have a nice one.
[2232.34s -> 2243.77s]  This is also expensive. What am I supposed to do with this? Um, coffee cup, eyelashes.
[2246.78s -> 2264.71s]  Hold on. I can put a car eyelashes on. All right. Wait, I want this. Okay. What do you, what?
[2265.51s -> 2278.02s]  Normand, leave me alone with the racetrack. There's nothing. What else do I need here? Okay.
[2278.74s -> 2286.86s]  So this is where you get the equipment. Window tint or green windows. What do you think?
[2289.02s -> 2291.26s]  I probably shouldn't spend any more money to be honest.
[2296.12s -> 2310.38s]  Next one. This is unique. How do I store this stuff? I don't know what this is. I'm taking this,
[2310.38s -> 2325.67s]  whatever it is though. I don't know what any of this stuff does, but I'm just going to take
[2325.67s -> 2329.40s]  as much, as much free stuff as I can fit in the trunk. Cause I don't know what this stuff does.
[2329.40s -> 2335.67s]  And I need to put gas in the car too. What about over here? What's this mixing paint?
[2335.67s -> 2357.48s]  $30 per can. What the fuck? This is stealing. I'm, I mean, this should be fine. Can I take anything
[2357.48s -> 2364.09s]  else? All right. I got to remember where this is. I need to start to put this into long-term
[2364.09s -> 2369.22s]  memory. Cause I'm going to drive around in a gosh darn circle or almost 45 minutes in without a funny
[2369.22s -> 2373.78s]  joke. You missed when I flipped the truck 400 times and went in the ocean. Sorry. Sorry. You
[2373.78s -> 2390.46s]  came late to the stream. All right. So now let me close this and put some gas in the car. I
[2390.46s -> 2399.06s]  probably shouldn't be on four wheel drive either. Right. I get $36. What side is the gas tank on?
[2399.86s -> 2434.41s]  Left side. What? What do you mean the store is closed? What are you talking about? Can I sleep
[2434.41s -> 2452.68s]  in the trunk? Do I even have enough gas to get back? How do I get, how do I get home? Okay.
[2455.34s -> 2464.15s]  Where's my house? I, from here. Can you guys please direct me? You actually, I actually don't know,
[2464.15s -> 2478.97s]  Wald. So if I'm on that top left kind of quadrant over here and my house is across the kind of lake
[2478.97s -> 2488.76s]  down, right? Just go right. Just take rights. Okay. I don't, I don't have enough gas to fucking
[2488.76s -> 2524.74s]  get out of here. I'm just going to sit here. Just sit at the window. Can you get hit by a car?
[2524.74s -> 2531.11s]  How long does it take to get to the morning? Go to the church. I don't have enough gas to go.
[2531.11s -> 2536.87s]  This is going to be a fucking disaster because you understand I am, I look at my gas tank.
[2536.87s -> 2547.51s]  How do I zoom in? I'm not going to get anywhere. Walk to the church. Oh God. I'm going to forget
[2547.51s -> 2566.41s]  where the fuck this is. All right. I'm going to church. That's gross. I can't, I don't even
[2566.49s -> 2576.14s]  think there's a run. This is making me think of the hot dog guy. I'm just saying I can do,
[2576.14s -> 2585.62s]  I can do it quick. It's in the air and it comes back down. Fastest hot dog shooter.
[2585.62s -> 2588.66s]  Hey, I don't know. I've never seen anybody do it like this in the Northwest. I don't know.
[2588.66s -> 2600.94s]  This is closed. I'm actually just going to be walking around until it's dawn. I've seen,
[2600.94s -> 2606.09s]  oh, I thought you said you've never seen that video. You know what's really wild thinking
[2606.09s -> 2613.75s]  about that? There's not, I think a person on earth that has not seen the fastest hot dog
[2613.75s -> 2622.97s]  shooter video. Imagine knowing that every single person on earth has seen that video and you're
[2622.97s -> 2637.59s]  that guy. Every single person on earth has seen that video. That's kind of crazy. All right. I
[2637.59s -> 2643.26s]  need to get out of here. Even I, should I just restart the game? Go back to your truck. You're
[2643.26s -> 2654.49s]  going to get robbed. You can wait, you can get robbed. Are you serious? Yes. Oh my goodness.
[2654.57s -> 2673.10s]  Don't even tell me. Do I have a weapon? I have a flashlight. How do I run? Slender man. All right.
[2673.10s -> 2698.33s]  I went this way. Can I do AMPM? I don't, I don't, I don't like the 19. I, I like to see AMPM. I have
[2698.33s -> 2707.50s]  to burn into memory how to get back here. Where the fuck am I going? Where's my truck? It was the
[2707.50s -> 2722.60s]  other way. It was, wasn't it right down this way from the church or was it that way? Gas station.
[2723.32s -> 2729.50s]  It was this way. I'm so useless without a fucking map indicator. I swear to God.
[2730.22s -> 2737.85s]  Where's the gas station from here? There's something behind you. There's nothing behind me. I'm
[2737.85s -> 2754.44s]  fine. It was, it was this way, wasn't it? Watch out. We literally saw it. There's no sprint either.
[2757.11s -> 2770.60s]  I just missed it. How could I, I don't see it. Where is it? This is the snack place. Okay. So
[2770.60s -> 2783.74s]  it's over here. Remember I go, I got a snack. Ah ha ha. And then I kept going. There it is.
[2783.74s -> 2811.66s]  What do you mean? Did you not hear that? I don't hear anything. Holy fuck. What? What? What? What?
[2811.82s -> 2827.53s]  I'm in the car. I'm safe. Drive, drive, drive. All right. All right. All right.
[2827.53s -> 2864.26s]  All right. How do I get out of here? I don't, I can't, I don't know. I can't read that.
[2864.26s -> 2874.04s]  Take the bus. It's almost midnight. Get out of here. I don't, you guys are fucking with me.
[2874.04s -> 2887.48s]  I'm hearing like sound. Okay. Should I just go this way? How do I turn my headlights on?
[2887.48s -> 2892.84s]  How do I turn the headlights on? Okay. It's a flashlight. I don't know. How do you turn on
[2892.84s -> 2947.77s]  headlights? Can you fucking imagine holding a flashlight to drive? What's that say? Guys,
[2947.77s -> 2974.65s]  there's no car light. Oh, there we go. I got it. Okay. If I follow this road, am I going to end up?
[2975.21s -> 2991.26s]  Okay. This is residential. Do the German nine eight five here a bit. I can't do that right now.
[2991.26s -> 3013.62s]  Don't stop at the barn. Run. Am I on the right track? I can't, this lights are terrible.
[3013.62s -> 3030.89s]  I can't take a left because this stupid ditch. I have to find the road where there's no ditch
[3030.89s -> 3050.87s]  right here. I'd be honest. Am I actually going on the right? All my shit just fell out. I'm
[3050.87s -> 3057.43s]  restarting the game. I'm re I'm going to restart the whole game. I'm restarting the whole game.
[3057.43s -> 3061.48s]  Now I get it. Now I understand what's going on. I'm restarting the game. I'm just going to restart.
[3061.48s -> 3073.18s]  Just redo the game. Let's restart. I'm restarting. Yes. I quit. New game. Okay. Now I get it.
[3073.18s -> 3093.64s]  Okay. Where's my. All right. Am I on the map? So this is my truck. This is the car. I have to
[3093.64s -> 3102.34s]  like do work to this car, right? I need a tire. How do I get to the task menu? Does it even exist?
[3102.34s -> 3127.58s]  There's a map. I don't think there is. Go to the shed bro. Build the sugar shack. Buy a roll of
[3127.58s -> 3140.07s]  tubing. Connect 10 maple trees to the shack. Okay. Build a sugar shack. Very. All right. Here we go.
[3140.07s -> 3150.31s]  All right. Okay. All right. What the fuck was I driving around for no reason? Look. Okay. To do.
[3152.79s -> 3165.64s]  Use the tool adjustable spanner to screw bolt. Okay. Screw bolt. I do that on the car like down
[3165.64s -> 3191.85s]  here, right? Yep. Okay. Very nice. Happy 420. Hey, happy 420 man. Yeah. One of those days. Can I
[3191.85s -> 3219.03s]  store stuff? Make this easier. These are so rusty. I put this here. Is this done? Yeah. I was going
[3219.03s -> 3222.66s]  to place all the screws first and then maybe I can actually drive this fucking thing and actually
[3222.66s -> 3232.44s]  drive an automatic car. My God. Those things are the same color as the ground. The screws.
[3233.08s -> 3260.81s]  Whatever. I'm not going to. Why would I restart? I'm fine. I need one more. There we go. Okay. So
[3260.81s -> 3269.46s]  now that I have the tire on, does this thing have an engine? Very cool. All right. So this is to do
[3269.46s -> 3291.62s]  right now. Install the intake back on the engine. Intake. How do I open the hood? I need the wrench
[3291.62s -> 3324.73s]  to do that. Inside the car. Oh, there it is. Open the fucking hood. What happened to my wrench?
[3324.73s -> 3347.88s]  How do I open the hood? You need to use the hoist. Hoist puller. Place it on the ground.
[3347.88s -> 3370.66s]  Patch it to vehicle. It was just a button. You fucking whackers. Whatever. Okay. Do I have to screw
[3370.66s -> 3386.78s]  it in? Oh, it's a generator. All right. So what happened to the wrench that I had? Install the
[3386.86s -> 3402.58s]  intake. Torque the wheels. Dude, I had a wrench and it's just fucking gone. Where is my wrench?
[3402.58s -> 3424.94s]  Is it right there? Where? Dude. Okay. I don't know where the wrench is. I have absolutely no idea.
[3424.94s -> 3457.59s]  Do I not have an inventory? Look down. Guys, it's not here. It's by the car?
[3468.18s -> 3479.66s]  Ha! Bruh, I can't. It's not on the screen right now. I'm being dead serious. It's not on the
[3479.66s -> 3487.05s]  screen. It's not on the screen. I dropped it somehow. Is it like in my hand? Is it like a wrench
[3487.05s -> 3499.37s]  button that I took? I stored it? Look down. Dude, we are at a bird's eye view. The wrench is not
[3499.37s -> 3535.35s]  on the ground. I'm, I think it's fucking bugged. I don't think it's in the, I don't think it's here.
[3535.35s -> 3544.42s]  I'm going to sit right here and I want everybody just to fucking tell me exactly where to go from
[3544.42s -> 3562.12s]  right here. I'm going to wait 10 seconds every time I ask. Behind the shed. You motherfucker.
[3562.12s -> 3568.04s]  You got to be kidding me. It's, uh, yeah. I, I never stepped, I never went over there.
[3568.60s -> 3573.88s]  I was never behind the shed. I, it bugged through the wall or something. Whatever. Who cares? Let's
[3573.88s -> 3595.56s]  go. All right. I need screws. I gotta screw this in, right? Short-term memory loss. I didn't even
[3595.56s -> 3603.64s]  go back there, dude. All right. How do I, um, is it 12? Is it, or is it just, okay, there we go.
[3603.64s -> 3634.68s]  Right there. That's in. I think I need like two or three. Bingo. What? One more. There. Okay.
[3634.68s -> 3642.86s]  Need more? When are you going to play Strawberry Magic 2? Okay. The people that are disrespecting
[3642.86s -> 3653.08s]  the streamer on telling me to play Strawberry Magic 2, I want them timed out. Um, is it, is it in?
[3653.08s -> 3682.70s]  I think it's in. Should I just close the hood? Are we good? Um, how do I, how do I say like,
[3682.70s -> 3685.58s]  uh, what else should I do? I screwed it in and do I have to do anything else?
[3686.06s -> 3695.32s]  Uggy part. Screws. Um, I don't know how to, like, solidify this. I need more screws. Really?
[3699.00s -> 3712.04s]  Oh, I don't know. It's right below you. Yeah. It looks like there's no more screws I can put in.
[3725.26s -> 3728.30s]  I don't think there's any more room for screws. How can I fit in here?
[3728.86s -> 3744.55s]  It screwed in. Are you mad at me? Look towards the black box? Oh, there we go. Okay. There it is.
[3744.55s -> 3755.11s]  There's my, there's my mon-bizow. Okay. Engine's in. Torque the wheels. I don't know what that
[3755.11s -> 3780.54s]  means. I think that's what it wants me to do, right? City boy. None of you guys here know any
[3780.54s -> 3789.70s]  of this shit either. Please. Some of you probably, some of you that do are sitting there going, I do.
[3790.58s -> 3797.30s]  You fucking bozo, right? But most of us have no idea what's going on here. Buy a tire pump at,
[3797.38s -> 3809.59s]  okay. Buy a tire pump at Cali Gas in town. Build the sugar shack. Let's go ahead and
[3809.59s -> 3819.46s]  just do this part first. I need a tire pump at Cali, Cali Gas in town. Does this car drive now?
[3819.46s -> 3835.98s]  Or do I have to take the truck? This has got no gas, so never mind. Don't take the chain,
[3835.98s -> 3847.77s]  so I'll put it in the shed. Why is he so mean today? I'm not being mean. I am handling a toxic
[3847.77s -> 3870.82s]  community. Take the gas can. Good call. I'm kidding. You guys are fine. Relax. Somebody said,
[3870.82s -> 3878.58s]  damn right. Get out of here. Relax. Okay. So, so where I am right now, I need to go to the gas
[3878.58s -> 3882.26s]  station. So to go into the gas station, don't go that way. It's just go to the main road,
[3882.26s -> 3888.36s]  which is that way over there. I have plenty of gas. I got my gas tank. I've got plenty of money.
[3888.36s -> 3894.04s]  I'm going to eat and drink something. That was a hard day's work on the car. I'm going to drink
[3894.04s -> 3906.30s]  this coffee. I'm going to spit into the toilet and miss and hit the ground and not clean it up.
[3906.30s -> 3916.26s]  We're going to go with our gray shirt today. Let me make sure I'm fully okay. I'm good. All right.
[3916.26s -> 3944.74s]  Good to go. We move. Remember this road. Burn it into your memory right now. This is loud,
[3944.74s -> 3950.66s]  isn't it? Day nine of German not reading my messages. I just read it. Sorry. You're going
[3950.66s -> 3976.33s]  to reset it. Okay. So this is now the main road. So this is a left. By the way, that's not a very
[3976.33s -> 3992.26s]  long counter. That's not that long. Do you understand? I said I was going to play paper
[3992.26s -> 3998.30s]  Mario like three years ago and somebody's been waiting for paper Mario every day. Do you
[3998.30s -> 4008.81s]  understand? It's just that like there are people that were waiting like two years for me to play
[4008.81s -> 4013.16s]  Cheeto, which understandable. I said I was going to play Cheeto like a year and a half ago and I
[4013.16s -> 4034.98s]  never did. What the fuck? I'm waiting for paper Mario. I don't think it's ever going to happen.
[4034.98s -> 4042.63s]  I just don't think so. We're fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Just don't freak out. Just let it go to
[4042.63s -> 4078.65s]  four wheel. The fuck is the road? You literally own the switch online. Just play it. Okay. I lost
[4078.65s -> 4107.46s]  my gas can. Was there anything else in the back of the car? Dude, where is the gas can? My God.
[4107.46s -> 4114.38s]  Is it the other way? No, I took this. I took the chance out. We're good. Other way. Oh my fucking
[4114.38s -> 4136.58s]  God. Disrespect me again and see why I'm on that today. Where is it? It's not. Hey, there it is.
[4136.58s -> 4153.46s]  I got it. And right now that person right now is going like I like go over I go and you can see
[4153.46s -> 4160.50s]  them through the windshield like and then they turn to the person in the passenger side and they're
[4160.50s -> 4170.65s]  like fucking idiot. Piece of fucking shit. What a dumb fuck that guy is. Fuck that guy. And then
[4170.65s -> 4187.32s]  as they as they're pulling away, it's like, yeah, good job, man. And then like, oh, and then and
[4187.32s -> 4197.78s]  then I go on like a 25 minute rant about like society and like humanity. The person writer.
[4197.78s -> 4216.06s]  Wrong way. This is the right way. This is the right way.
[4223.30s -> 4241.77s]  Um, am I I'm going the right way, right? I don't know. Oh, shit. Sorry. Hey, I go down. I grab my
[4241.77s -> 4263.86s]  phone. Oh, my phone. Hey, I think no, this is the right way. Isn't the church over there? I actually
[4263.86s -> 4275.54s]  think I might have turned around. I don't know. No, it's not. Can I drive by this? How do I hit?
[4287.06s -> 4308.38s]  No, please. No, please. I was going the wrong way. Gas. It's in the trunk. It's right there.
[4308.94s -> 4331.56s]  Stop distracting me. Oh, my God. I can't fucking play this. Did you lose the gas can?
[4333.48s -> 4346.36s]  I can't fucking play this game. If the game does not have a map indicator, I can't play it.
[4346.36s -> 4352.76s]  I have to be honest with you. If I can't see a blip on the map right now, I can't play the game.
[4352.76s -> 4371.98s]  It's not possible. There it is. I got it in the cab. Yeah, there's no map indicator. I can't play
[4371.98s -> 4378.17s]  the game because I'll get distracted and look over here and like, look at you while I'm still
[4378.17s -> 4384.18s]  holding W turn like this and then look back this way. And I think I'm on the same road that I was
[4384.18s -> 4402.18s]  when I looked over at you. So it's not happening. You should just do paper Mario. You wouldn't
[4402.18s -> 4406.98s]  survive 23 hours in the wilderness. Yes, I would because I would just eat fucking bugs and dirt
[4406.98s -> 4414.09s]  and I'd be fine. You don't need a map to eat bugs on the ground. Excuse me. I would be just
[4414.09s -> 4425.30s]  fine. Did you never survive like in the wilderness 24 hours? I would eat bugs on the ground and I
[4425.30s -> 4433.67s]  would live. Okay. Next question, please. I don't need a map to figure out how to eat fucking like
[4434.63s -> 4457.80s]  stuff on the grubs on the ground. Sorry about that. I wish there was a horn. Yep. Still funny,
[4457.80s -> 4470.17s]  I guess. This is not even remotely where the town is, though, by the way. Like, do I even have a
[4470.17s -> 4477.06s]  compass? I don't even know. How do I get to the fucking town? The gas station is going to close.
[4477.06s -> 4510.42s]  Hurry up. This person thinks I'm fucking chasing them. I'm driving in a giant circle. I don't
[4510.42s -> 4529.77s]  think this is how you get to the fucking town. I've been. Oh my fucking God. I've been driving
[4529.77s -> 4545.34s]  around in a circle, the bottom left. Okay. So where the fuck even am I? There's three of those
[4545.98s -> 4561.11s]  silo places. Am I driving straight now? Just keep going straight. You actually need waypoints.
[4564.68s -> 4569.72s]  I'm sorry. There's one road to get to the town and there's no compass and there's no. The map is
[4569.72s -> 4576.52s]  just like a map that I. It's like Elden Ring. It's like the Elden Ring map. And to get to Lunaria,
[4576.52s -> 4583.29s]  I have to. Whatever. North, south, east, west. They've had that since the fucking stone age.
[4583.29s -> 4608.90s]  Where is it? There we go. Take a right? What the fuck? I just wish I had a compass.
[4614.49s -> 4629.69s]  Cavemen were looking at the sun like burning their eyes and going like, oh, that way. You need to use
[4629.69s -> 4655.72s]  the sun. Okay. Oh, there we go. Hey, I don't. I found it. All right. All right. All right. All
[4655.72s -> 4689.40s]  right. I need, I need to go to the store. The store was over here. I remember the school. Hey.
[4689.40s -> 4693.77s]  Okay. What did I need to do? I needed to buy something from here. What did I need to buy?
[4693.77s -> 4702.49s]  It was something from here. Don't you don't close yet. It was some kind of a torque thing, right?
[4702.49s -> 4768.02s]  Pire pump. Thank you. Why not? I don't want to buy super. How do I fill the tank? Take the cap off?
[4768.02s -> 4793.45s]  How made the wrench? Uh, it's, they're going to close in fucking one second. You just get gas in
[4793.45s -> 4844.17s]  the car. Okay. Take this off. I got the tire pump at least. Okay. Um, how do you fill the gap? Do I
[4844.17s -> 4851.98s]  have to actually go in here and say, can I fill this? They're not closed yet. Do I have to like,
[4851.98s -> 4867.58s]  how do I, I wanted to fill this open the cap. I, there's some special fucking like sit around
[4867.58s -> 4883.98s]  and do a seance to get the cap to open, steal the gas. I can't. And guys, where did it take the
[4883.98s -> 4924.31s]  nozzle off the can? How do you, but how do you do that? The other one? God damn it. What is this?
[4924.31s -> 4938.89s]  What the hell is that? What, what is this? What is the item? I'll be back tomorrow motherfucker.
[4938.89s -> 4959.94s]  And I'm going to fill this. I'm out of gas. Yeah, I know. Take the, but I thought I could just go
[4959.94s -> 4966.62s]  over there and like press E. It says like E to U. I don't, I don't, I'm trying. I, I don't know.
[4966.62s -> 4971.98s]  I had to like unscrew the cap. I, I come over to this fucking thing and I'm pressing it. First of
[4971.98s -> 4981.59s]  all, it says, sorry, you don't use that, that like pleb gas. I got the tire pump. Who cares?
[4981.59s -> 5013.24s]  Where's the, okay. Okay. So what's the fastest way to get back to the house? That way, the,
[5013.24s -> 5019.74s]  this way, right? There's the church, but bro, I don't even know what direction I'm fucking facing.
[5019.74s -> 5054.97s]  Absolutely not. You have a map. I don't know what road I'm on. I don't know what road I'm even on.
[5054.97s -> 5073.40s]  I'm like in the town up here somewhere. Okay. Is the church on the map? I can't look closer.
[5073.40s -> 5092.60s]  I'm going to growl in a second. Snack bar. Okay. The snack bar is circled at like, as like 10 out
[5092.60s -> 5100.70s]  of 10. So I'm on, I can't even point at it. I can't even show you. I think I'm on the road.
[5100.70s -> 5108.31s]  That's like to the bottom right of 10 out of 10, right? So I need to go straight left, right,
[5108.31s -> 5126.39s]  straight left, right. Let's see if that works. Straight left, right. That not right. This is
[5126.39s -> 5140.89s]  the school bus straight, right, left. I think I'm going the right way is now. Wait, is it that road
[5140.89s -> 5159.61s]  right there? Cause this is now, bro, I have no idea. You pass the bus to get in, but then I'm
[5159.61s -> 5170.79s]  going to be on this. This is really far away, isn't it? This is the wrong bridge. Yeah. Now I'm all
[5170.79s -> 5197.93s]  the fucking way left. Okay. So I passed this, but I drove around in a huge circle. I'm not going to
[5197.93s -> 5212.79s]  have enough gas to get home, let alone come back here and fill the tank. Left was a shortcut.
[5212.79s -> 5227.40s]  I'm not going to be able to drive the car back here. Why do you have Fulbright on your webcam?
[5227.40s -> 5251.43s]  I have auto exposure on. I don't know. Am I in four wheel drive? You need to take, I'm literally
[5251.43s -> 5322.07s]  driving the worst possible way to get back here. Oh God. I'm just, okay. First of all, where am I
[5322.07s -> 5329.43s]  on this map right now? Where, where is, where is my fucking house? Where is my house on this map?
[5329.43s -> 5354.92s]  Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? What is it called? It's called roulette. Okay. Roulette
[5354.92s -> 5364.10s]  means my house. Okay. That's all I need to know. So if I go left on this road and then go right
[5364.10s -> 5373.99s]  and then go left, I'll be in town. It means trailer. So I go left, just bang right. Don't
[5373.99s -> 5384.76s]  go down this stupid ass highway. Left, stay right and then left and then get into town. I got it.
[5384.76s -> 5398.17s]  Okay. Get me the fuck out of here before I freak out the fucking goddamn door. Put the stupid gas
[5398.17s -> 5403.22s]  tank in here. I'm ready. I'll fix the car up in a minute. I'll fix the car up in just a moment.
[5403.62s -> 5407.62s]  I'm not going to get angry. I'm just going to relax. We're just going to go and it's, it's,
[5407.62s -> 5415.83s]  it's literally left on this road. Hang a right and then hang my first left. I can take, I'll be in
[5415.83s -> 5423.32s]  town. Left, hang a right. Let's go. Let's go. Everybody relax. Everything's fine. This is,
[5423.32s -> 5427.42s]  this is it right now. We're going to go. Nobody yell. Nobody freak out. We're going to, everything's
[5427.42s -> 5441.66s]  going to be just fine. Okay. Everything. We're good. Hey, see, see, I'm happy. Fucking
[5444.26s -> 5448.98s]  I'm 36. We don't fucking freak out. It's a video game. I turn, I'm 36 years old.
[5449.70s -> 5453.22s]  We don't have fucking temper tantrums over like not being able to know where the parking break
[5453.22s -> 5457.62s]  is. We relax and we're an adult now. We're an adult and we've been an adult for a long time.
[5464.07s -> 5472.76s]  Don't run into the school bus. Okay. So no, no, no, no, no. Go this way.
[5482.17s -> 5488.54s]  I am now on this road. We're going to go left. Remember this. This is like the little, like the
[5488.54s -> 5501.51s]  Moses split the fucking ocean. We're going to go here. Here we are. Okay. We are now at this
[5501.51s -> 5506.63s]  intersection where we're going to go left. Stay, don't go that way. Stay left. Stay straight over
[5506.63s -> 5521.96s]  here. Left, right. Stay this way and go. Okay. Left and go. Very easy. Simple. We're good.
[5521.96s -> 5531.83s]  We're good. Don't freak it out. No, like dry out of a clips. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[5531.83s -> 5536.63s]  Everything's fine. Now we're fine. It was easy. It was just simple. I just didn't know where my
[5536.63s -> 5542.55s]  house was. I didn't know that roulette meant house in fucking French. I got my compass. Now
[5542.55s -> 5546.87s]  that's all I needed. Remember this. I do. All right, everybody. We're good. We're good. We're
[5546.87s -> 5551.48s]  good. We're good. We're good. We're good. No, fuck. Just don't fuck.
[5554.82s -> 5577.85s]  Okay. Can I put this in the glove box? So now I need to pay attention because take a look at this.
[5577.85s -> 5586.42s]  Ready? I am right now. I wish I could point with my mouse. I, I am right now right at the little
[5586.42s -> 5592.82s]  tip of the bottom of the top Island. Right? So if I drive straight on this road and then
[5593.46s -> 5597.58s]  I got to remember, let me burn this into my memory right now. That mountain right there,
[5597.58s -> 5602.14s]  this one right here, drive towards that mountain and have that mountain be on your left here on the
[5602.14s -> 5610.33s]  right spot. The church needs to be on my right. Going out mountain right there. There it is.
[5610.33s -> 5640.94s]  Got it. Abstinence Andy. Mountain peak, mountain peak, mountain peak left. Mountain peak, mountain
[5640.94s -> 5644.94s]  peak, mountain peak left. Mountain peak, mountain peak, mountain peak left. Mountain peak, mountain
[5644.94s -> 5649.42s]  peak, mountain peak left. I will never forget it now. I made it a stupid fucking song and let me
[5649.42s -> 5679.90s]  like make it so I'm not like a fucking red Andy here. That's better. All right. All right. We can
[5679.90s -> 5683.34s]  now play the game now. I apologize to everybody that came here and said I'm fucking leaving this
[5683.34s -> 5687.80s]  stream. This guy sucks. If you came back to check, you probably didn't, but I'm, I'm now playing the
[5687.80s -> 5709.74s]  game now. Question is from the church. Who's that? It's not going anywhere. What's up? Some cars make
[5709.74s -> 5717.00s]  so much noise. Ew. Can you find something for me, please? I take a walk this afternoon. I can look
[5717.00s -> 5734.92s]  for your object. I didn't lose anything. Did I? You only have $80. That's interesting. All right.
[5735.00s -> 5741.56s]  I gotta hurry up before the sun goes down because I'm restarting a third time. That would be an
[5741.56s -> 5759.43s]  embarrassment. I'm not going to run somebody over for fun. Okay. The gas station is now down here.
[5759.43s -> 5765.29s]  So it's just straight to the gas station. Don't look at the snack bullshit. Don't go over there.
[5766.26s -> 5794.81s]  Right here. It's just straight. No, it's not. Okay. It's a left at the snack shack. We go straight
[5794.89s -> 5808.07s]  and then it's a left at the end of the snack shack road. He's so mad. Um, I am. I am. I'm trying to
[5808.07s -> 5817.18s]  calm down. I really am. I'm trying to relax, but I'm so fucking heated. Okay. Where's the gas station?
[5833.16s -> 5840.31s]  School bus was there and then it says snack shack, but this, the gas station is all on here.
[5840.95s -> 5845.11s]  What do you mean? Ludwig's coming. What do you mean? All Ludwig for directions. What do you mean?
[5845.11s -> 5917.90s]  What's Ludwig coming? I got it. Give me fucking gas. Stop. Stop the car. Stop the car. So what
[5917.90s -> 5973.24s]  do I do now? Okay. Please screw this back on. It took him two hours to do this. Dude, give me a
[5973.24s -> 5987.27s]  little bit of a slack here. Okay. This is confusing. Okay. I have gas. I want more gas in this car.
[5987.27s -> 6005.13s]  Give me this. Open that up. I want more gas. Get out of the fucking car. Is this actually working?
[6005.13s -> 6032.78s]  Turn the car off. How much is the bike pump? How much is the bike pump? All right. Okay. I only have
[6032.78s -> 6073.10s]  $6 left. Is that bad? Broke ass. I made it before they closed. Hey, it drove into a house. All right.
[6073.10s -> 6085.54s]  Do I have everything I need? Okay. What was that fun song that we sang? Mountain peak left. Just
[6085.54s -> 6109.93s]  find the mountain peak. Save the game. Uh, how? It's not that one. It's over here. There it is.
[6110.57s -> 6131.58s]  Got it. Okay. Mountain peak. It's be on our left. So now we just drive on this road. We go through
[6132.68s -> 6152.62s]  the, the Moses pass, which is right here. Well, no, no, no, not quite. So now we are at this
[6152.62s -> 6167.42s]  intersection. We stay to the right. Wait. No, we don't. We go. Yes, we stay right. Yes, we do.
[6167.42s -> 6173.43s]  Stay to the stop lying to me because I'm at that. We stay right. And then I drive on this road
[6173.43s -> 6178.73s]  forever. Wait. Yep. And then here we go. Done. Done. Done. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[6178.73s -> 6180.81s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[6180.81s -> 6183.61s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. I'm not going to let you guys gaslight the fuck out of me right
[6183.61s -> 6209.78s]  now. Not when I'm this upset. Here we go. Here's the Moses split. Get it. Finally got it. Everything's
[6209.78s -> 6224.28s]  fine. Right? Yeah. This is worse than the unlocked stream. Oh, it's not. You're out of your mind.
[6225.74s -> 6242.17s]  You've, you've gone, you've gone hollow. If you think that. Thank God. Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
[6245.59s -> 6267.93s]  Let's go. Where's the gas tank? Oh my God. Finally. There's a gas tank. Let's do it. Oh my God. I
[6267.93s -> 6290.25s]  finally can drive the car. This is working. I'm not fucking doing that till I'm certain that's
[6290.25s -> 6297.32s]  happening. Okay. I know it's on. Yeah. I'm not doing that till I'm 100% certain. Where'd the
[6297.32s -> 6309.54s]  cat, where'd the gas go? I'm not certain that that's actually working. So I'm just going to
[6309.54s -> 6317.64s]  sit this down. Okay. I don't know if that's working or not. So I'm afraid to do that until
[6317.64s -> 6335.35s]  I'm certain. So let's, let's do, let's fix the goddamn car. Good. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[6335.35s -> 6344.89s]  Very good. Very good. Very good. The wrench, the wrench out here. Let's go. This is big progress.
[6344.89s -> 6351.34s]  It kind of, it is. It really is. I wish I could pick up more than one thing at a time though.
[6357.11s -> 6362.87s]  Every screw is going over here. This is worse than the unlocked stream. No, it's not. And you know
[6362.87s -> 6368.63s]  why it's not? Because you couldn't even read the text in the unlocked stream. It was not even
[6368.63s -> 6372.79s]  visible. You couldn't read it. And that was the whole stream was you being able to read the text
[6372.79s -> 6381.16s]  on the cards. There's no way this is worse. Not a chance. Not a chance in fucking hell.
[6381.80s -> 6407.62s]  All right. Let's go. All right. Bingo. This dude's hair makes him look like he got back from a parent
[6407.62s -> 6427.72s]  teacher conference. Oh, what is it? Parent teacher conference hair. I don't, I wish I knew. I, I'm
[6427.72s -> 6432.55s]  too old to understand what that means. What's that supposed to mean? You're, oh, parent teacher
[6432.55s -> 6446.09s]  conference Andy. Why do I like just picture like a bunch of kids laughing at me right now?
[6446.09s -> 6452.41s]  Doing the loud kid point laugh thing where they go ha ha ha ha like loud.
[6454.31s -> 6467.06s]  Really? Parent teacher conference. And I'm just sitting there with like suspenders on.
[6467.06s -> 6491.80s]  Look at this guy's hair. I don't even, what do you even mean? What are you, who, who,
[6491.80s -> 6512.60s]  what are you on about? Wrong screws. I'm going to fix this car and I'm going to play this game.
[6513.32s -> 6533.75s]  And I'm telling you right now, it's going to be epic. Um, you just, I need to put the car up so
[6533.75s -> 6585.53s]  I can get underneath, jack the shit up right now. Where does it go? I don't, I fucking don't
[6585.53s -> 6625.69s]  understand what's going on with this goddamn thing. Give me the, is that bad? That in? Okay.
[6625.69s -> 6638.79s]  That's in. I think there's one more that I have not tightened. Here we go. Okay. The engines in
[6638.79s -> 6646.42s]  there. What the hell do you want me to do now? Pork the wheels with this thing, right? I got it.
[6646.42s -> 6672.73s]  I got it. I got it. We're good. Do power generator and save the game. I don't think this has any gas.
[6672.73s -> 6698.73s]  Does this have gas? I can't tell. I don't know. Uh, is that halfway? So I have to start it. I think
[6698.73s -> 6748.01s]  it's on. All right. Power the computer. Chill the computers. I want to save. Hurry up. Okay.
[6748.09s -> 6756.68s]  Save the game. Thank God. It took two hours to save the game and be at a place where I'm good.
[6756.68s -> 6805.27s]  Oh my God. Thank God. We're playing age of empires. Okay. So now there's a good bed. Okay.
[6805.27s -> 6820.49s]  It's Monday. Still raining. I have potatoes and shit in the car. Right. Deep fryer. Okay. All
[6820.49s -> 6844.70s]  right. All right. Right. Let me do this too. Put it in the fridge too. It's 12 AM. What I'm bringing
[6844.70s -> 6857.69s]  my groceries in. Oh, I put 50 curry. Oh, I didn't want to do that. Okay. We're good. Should I have
[6857.69s -> 6880.78s]  not put those in? Should go back to bed. Hold on. Listen to shed. All right. I think everything's
[6880.78s -> 6885.02s]  out of the truck. There's only one more. That's it. Yeah. Okay. Everything's out of the truck.
[6885.02s -> 6897.99s]  Do a trampoline stream. Okay. Close this up. Should I put the cheese in here? 100 curds cheese in
[6897.99s -> 6905.26s]  there. 0% French fries. All right. Here's the French fry cutter. You're missing a frying basket
[6905.26s -> 6922.44s]  in the deep fryer. Do I have a frying basket? I probably should put these in here because the
[6922.44s -> 6942.84s]  won't they go bad? Um, all right. So do I have to don't lose that potato? I only have one potato
[6942.84s -> 6972.58s]  for the love of God. Is it in the sink? It's not in the sink. Do I need to buy a fry basket?
[6976.26s -> 6989.14s]  But do I have one here somewhere? I don't think I have one. Well, I'll just put it in the fridge.
[6990.22s -> 6999.37s]  Figure that out later. Is it in the sink? I mean, if that's it, I can't. No, that's like a sink
[6999.37s -> 7018.68s]  thing. Frying basket. I don't think I have one. Turn the light on. No, I don't have one. If I do,
[7018.68s -> 7023.91s]  it's in a place. I don't know where it is. Okay. All right. Uh, that car is almost ready to go.
[7025.74s -> 7032.90s]  I don't know where it could be anywhere. It's the square basket in the. No, I don't have one.
[7032.90s -> 7051.91s]  I'm just gonna go back to bed. Okay. It's almost time to get up. Can I turn the computer off? Yeah,
[7051.91s -> 7072.71s]  turn that off. Lift on Martin. Ask Martin for a lift. Martin is sleeping. Try later. Wait,
[7072.71s -> 7075.51s]  you'd mean to tell me that I could have just gotten in somebody else's car the whole time?
[7076.15s -> 7100.33s]  It's 3 a.m. Hold on. Can I change this to? I don't think I can. Oh, dude. 144. Ow, my ears.
[7101.29s -> 7108.22s]  We're almost there. All right. Let me just. I can work on the car a little bit more now.
[7108.78s -> 7114.41s]  All right. So that was the wheels. What's now? I have to pump the tires up, right?
[7115.74s -> 7126.52s]  Talk to your brother, Francis. Um, plant a tree, find some seeds, harvest a plant, make a cannabis.
[7126.52s -> 7139.18s]  Wait, I got seeds. Where's my brother? Is he on the map? Okay. Do I know where Francis is?
[7145.24s -> 7155.29s]  Potato is gone. No, it's not. Right there. Brother's name is Francis. I don't see Francis on here.
[7157.27s -> 7180.01s]  Parfait. Does this mean like one of these mean brother? Brother is top right. Top right. Okay.
[7180.01s -> 7188.81s]  So I need to go right on this road and then bang a right and then bang a right and stay on the road.
[7188.81s -> 7200.68s]  I got it. I don't think it's actually top. But don't lie to me. Where is it? That was a lie. Oh.
[7200.68s -> 7212.97s]  Brother is French is, uh, ask your brother. What does the fridge note say? Oh,
[7212.97s -> 7223.45s]  that's a let's find out. Mammon mother. Can I call my mom and ask what my brother's phone number is?
[7223.45s -> 7234.42s]  Or is there like a note with my brother's phone number on it? Martin. I'm just gonna call mom.
[7234.42s -> 7262.04s]  Maybe mom will know. Snack delivery. Need driver. Okay. 2109 room cleaning will be done.
[7263.00s -> 7280.97s]  I'm just coming to clean my room. Okay. Uh, plant the potato. Where can I plant the potato?
[7280.97s -> 7307.59s]  All right. What's this? Stick it in the ground. Coupler. I probably put, I gotta put gas in there,
[7307.59s -> 7335.29s]  but not yet. So how am I supposed to know where my brother is? A potato seeds. So where should
[7335.29s -> 7344.18s]  I put these? Can I put them anywhere? I'm back here, right? All right. I'm going to put my potatoes
[7344.18s -> 7376.44s]  like over here. I need the shovel right here. Holy shit. Let's go. Got water too. We've rains coming
[7376.44s -> 7393.93s]  in. All right. Hell yeah. So that's infinite food now. Okay. So now I need to find the brother.
[7393.93s -> 7416.06s]  I'm gonna drink something first. Pass bow. Is that brother? Where? This one's low left.
[7416.06s -> 7422.82s]  All right. So does he just take, go left here? That's where he is. I should have enough gas.
[7422.82s -> 7451.90s]  So he's right here on this road. That's not brother. All right. Hold on. Let me take a look.
[7451.90s -> 7472.50s]  So right now I'm about to pass pass bow. Uh, let's keep driving. It's there. They're lying to you.
[7472.50s -> 7485.56s]  Okay. All right. Looking in town. Well, this is a house right here. Let's see. Let's see if he's
[7485.56s -> 7510.94s]  here. That's probably him right there. All right. Who the fuck are you? How's your day going? Can't
[7510.94s -> 7530.52s]  wait for summer. Each weekend I will go out camping for sure. Okay. You can sell firewood here. All
[7530.52s -> 7542.94s]  right. All right. So now can I drive that other car? If I put gas in that car, can I drive it now?
[7542.94s -> 7567.72s]  Place firewood here to sell. How do I get firewood? Uh, do I have to buy like an axe,
[7567.72s -> 7573.66s]  chainsaw? Can I cut down any tree or do I have to cut down specific ones?
[7573.66s -> 7589.10s]  Just hit a tree with your truck. I'm going to go get the chainsaw because I need money. I don't
[7589.10s -> 7614.23s]  need. I have $0 man. Am I on gas on this car? I'm okay. So I'm going to load this truck up with a
[7614.23s -> 7627.51s]  shitload of firewood. That sounds good. The parking brake is not on. All right. I got to stop looking
[7627.51s -> 7636.38s]  at the chat room when I'm driving a vehicle. That would be fucking swell. Oh my God. Don't even
[7636.38s -> 7672.90s]  fucking tell me we're good. Okay. Chainsaw please. Now does this thing have gas too? Like does this
[7672.90s -> 7697.10s]  thing have gas or is it just going to work? I can't cut this. Uh, okay. Well, what about over here?
[7697.10s -> 7710.49s]  Gas too. It's only the dead trees. This is a birch tree. All right. So that counts. Okay. So now
[7711.61s -> 7718.14s]  I'll load this up. I'm good. This is going to be sick. Let's go. I'm just going to pull it over
[7718.14s -> 7734.92s]  here. No, I'm not. Just walk it. I have to cut it again. Cut it until it's okay. All right. All
[7734.92s -> 7755.54s]  right. Let's go. How much do you get per, uh, per thing of wood? I need to use the log splitter.
[7755.54s -> 7759.46s]  Well, I got to, I'm going to load the truck up and then I'll take it from here.
[7759.46s -> 7768.17s]  Right. I'm assuming the green circle is how you turn it into firewood, right? Nobody here knows.
[7768.17s -> 7791.80s]  It's behind the house. I don't think so. Let me just check something real quick.
[7791.80s -> 7805.29s]  No, okay. I can't cut it anymore. It's the red thing. Guys, this is like a trailer. This is a
[7805.29s -> 7817.50s]  trailer. What are you talking about? Am I high? Are you high? This is not a log splitter. This is
[7817.50s -> 7829.78s]  a coupler. You attach it to the back of a truck. It's not, I think, what are you? Oh my goodness.
[7834.07s -> 7843.06s]  It's not a wood cutter. This is the thing you attached a trailer to a truck. That's not a wood
[7843.06s -> 7852.06s]  cutter. What do you mean look at it? I'm not looking at it. Bro, fellas, ladies and gentlemen,
[7852.14s -> 7868.49s]  that is not a wood cutter. This is not a wood cutter. It is. Yeah, it isn't. Look, I'm not,
[7868.49s -> 7873.13s]  I'm not, I don't need to prove this anymore. You guys are losing your minds. You guys are
[7873.13s -> 7879.34s]  losing your fucking minds. It's not a log splitter. What the, what is happening in this chat room?
[7880.30s -> 7886.76s]  This is a trailer. What is happening here? Oh, you guys are fucked up. I'm leaving.
[7904.86s -> 7911.10s]  Look up a Google image of a log splitter. I'm fucking freaking out right now. Log splitter.
[7925.18s -> 7931.18s]  This is a trailer. This is, I don't know, I don't, huh? You gotta be kidding me, man.
[7931.74s -> 7943.53s]  No, it's not. This is not. I tried to use it. What? You can't be serious, man.
[7945.94s -> 7949.78s]  No, I thought it was people just fucking with me and just making up random shit.
[7949.78s -> 7969.77s]  This is a log splitter. I thought this is something you attach to the back of a truck.
[7973.72s -> 7993.54s]  Dude, no way. No way. I thought every, wow. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. How do you turn
[7993.54s -> 8008.54s]  it on then? It does both? I've never seen one of these in my entire life. Is there enough fuel in
[8008.54s -> 8023.61s]  it? City boy. I'm sorry, but I don't know how many of us here have never seen a wood splitting
[8023.61s -> 8049.03s]  machine in their entire life. I haven't. Come on, dude. Apologize. No.
[8059.82s -> 8064.46s]  Is he high? I'm sitting there freaking out about this. How do I turn this on?
[8068.49s -> 8092.54s]  Do you see how soft my hands are? Look at how soft they are. I've never seen this before in
[8092.54s -> 8099.91s]  my whole life. I always just, it's always the guy that's, okay. It's always, anytime I think of
[8099.91s -> 8108.22s]  wood cutting or log cutting, it's this jacked guy with like huge pecs and a fucking like just abs.
[8108.22s -> 8113.58s]  And he's wicked sweating and he's like smashing through wicked hard with an axe. I've never seen
[8113.58s -> 8128.38s]  somebody do it with a machine ever. It's always a jacked guy with no shirt on. I've never seen a
[8128.38s -> 8151.42s]  machine. That's so funny. That's actually really funny. I can't believe it. Okay, turn this off.
[8151.42s -> 8163.88s]  Don't waste gas. How much can I put in the truck? Probably a lot, right? Apology. Okay. I'm sorry
[8164.68s -> 8171.80s]  that I told you guys that you were stupid because I thought that the trailer that you attached to
[8171.80s -> 8177.56s]  the back of the truck was apparently like a piston operated electronic gas operated log cutting
[8177.56s -> 8211.67s]  machine. I'm sorry that, but come on, you guys have been messing with me all day though. How am
[8211.67s -> 8219.19s]  I supposed to know when you guys are not? All right. Give me, I need to make a ton of money.
[8219.19s -> 8229.72s]  He's a city slicker. The only, guys, people are doing like, I'm the kind of person that, oh hey,
[8229.72s -> 8234.60s]  oh yeah, we're going to go up back and we're going to, we're going to build a fucking shed.
[8235.16s -> 8238.87s]  I'm like, okay, does anybody need their taxes done? Like I can, I'll help you do that.
[8241.16s -> 8249.21s]  I can, you know, I can help with something else. I'm not, I'm not the kind of person that knows
[8249.21s -> 8255.32s]  what this is. Like, oh, do you want, I can actually like, you want me to run, what do you need?
[8256.33s -> 8261.90s]  You need oil and you need, you need like this like kind of like special kind of like grease or
[8261.90s -> 8266.65s]  something that I can go get or you need like, I'll run, I'll run Home Depot. Yeah, I'll be right back.
[8266.65s -> 8271.99s]  I'll be back in like 10 minutes. Anybody need coffee or anything? Like I'm, that's me. I'm that
[8271.99s -> 8295.22s]  kind of person. That's, I'm that guy. I gotta pull the truck down. Yeah, I'm that guy. You don't want
[8295.22s -> 8302.25s]  me to cut the wood. You really don't. I'm telling you right now. I promise you. I, I don't even know
[8302.25s -> 8309.35s]  how it would happen. I would go to cut the wood and like the axe would come out of my hand and
[8309.35s -> 8315.27s]  like go flying. Like the handle would break off somehow. Like a fucking, like a comic, like cartoon
[8315.27s -> 8344.28s]  style. I don't know how it would happen, but it would. The wood and the meat grinder. You were a
[8344.28s -> 8350.82s]  gym bro. Like 10 years ago, I, and I wouldn't, I wouldn't have cut wood back then either. I still
[8350.82s -> 8355.32s]  would have been the guy that goes and gets the coffee. Just because I was in the gym does not
[8355.32s -> 8360.12s]  mean I would be comfortable swinging an axe or touching heavy machinery. That doesn't change.
[8364.18s -> 8367.38s]  I would go like to pour your coffee, you know, and it'd be like this. It'd be kind of hard.
[8367.94s -> 8401.75s]  I don't know what I mean, but I'd still do it. Please don't even give me a break. Did you ever
[8401.75s -> 8405.83s]  skip leg day? I never did legs once. That's a lie. I'm kidding. Don't fucking be an idiot.
[8410.50s -> 8425.03s]  Goddamn parking brake is going to make me lose my mind. Okay. I am doing this. I know this is
[8425.03s -> 8429.75s]  people are going to like, oh, snooze fastism, snoozing. I can't, I wake me up when he's doing
[8429.75s -> 8436.66s]  so I'm, I'm one try to like, I need money. I'm going to fill this car with this shit.
[8436.66s -> 8440.34s]  It's going to be to the brim and I'm going to make like $150 at least.
[8441.06s -> 8455.90s]  Three trees is enough. We'll see. Maybe one, one more tree. I promise. That's it.
[8462.46s -> 8470.49s]  I can't, I, that was visible, audible and mental shock that this was actually a real thing.
[8474.07s -> 8476.79s]  Please be okay. Everybody here. Be honest with me though. Be honest with me.
[8477.35s -> 8483.32s]  Did you actually know what this was? Like how many of you knew what this, this, this was actually
[8483.32s -> 8496.66s]  that, what that is? I've been to Home Depot. I've been to Home Depot a shitload of times too. And
[8496.66s -> 8500.42s]  I've never gone to the wood cutting machines and gone and wow, that's interesting. How does that
[8500.42s -> 8506.55s]  work? No, I go to Home Depot and I walk around in a circle looking for a light bulb and I don't know
[8506.55s -> 8510.63s]  where the fuck they are until I find the one person that points me to the other end of the entire like
[8510.63s -> 8516.39s]  three mile long store. That's like, oh, the light bulbs are at aisle 400 and then I go to aisle 400
[8516.39s -> 8534.58s]  and then I leave. All right. Well, last one, one more and that's it. I promise. This is it. Okay.
[8534.58s -> 8557.58s]  We're good. This is not efficient, but it's okay. What about Ikea? Well, the great thing about Ikea
[8557.58s -> 8565.06s]  is Ikea makes it so you cannot screw it up. You have to walk through the whole store and the store
[8565.06s -> 8568.18s]  is like, Hey, by the way, just letting you know, you're walking through this part of like Disney
[8568.18s -> 8574.90s]  world. You have to walk through everything in Ikea. And there are like Dark Souls shortcuts in Ikea
[8574.90s -> 8580.54s]  if you feel like skipping to something else, but you don't have to do that. Like I know that I'm
[8580.54s -> 8586.23s]  just going to eventually walk into the kitchen appliance section in Ikea. I'm just eventually
[8586.23s -> 8612.78s]  going to, it's going to happen eventually. I love that place by the way. Oh dude, all the meatballs,
[8612.78s -> 8629.98s]  right? All right. That's enough. They're actually really good. And I know everyone's like batch
[8629.98s -> 8633.50s]  testing right now, but they're actually really good. Well, pretty much all the food from there
[8633.50s -> 8638.63s]  is really good. They have like salmons. They have sauces. They have all kinds of meatballs.
[8638.63s -> 8659.78s]  It's cool. It's really cool. It's a nice place. It's fine. What's what? It's good stuff. I love
[8659.78s -> 8669.56s]  Ikea meatballs, Bat Chest. And then when you go to Ikea and you eat them and then you fucking
[8669.56s -> 8686.66s]  literally delete all of your like the chat logs. I don't want to even know I said that. They're not
[8686.66s -> 8703.14s]  bad. They're not bad. All right. There's a lot. Okay. I understand now when people say, okay,
[8703.14s -> 8709.35s]  I'll tell you right now, if I drive on the road and I flipped this car over and it's ruined and
[8709.35s -> 8716.28s]  this was like the last like half an hour was a waste of time. I'm going to do everything in my
[8716.28s -> 8724.73s]  power to make that not possible. Cause this is probably like a few hundred bucks worth of wood.
[8725.29s -> 8737.59s]  Put a tarp over it. Can you do that? And this off wasted gas. Stop wasting gas. Bat Chest.
[8748.54s -> 8756.82s]  Almost there. Everybody hold on. You can wake up in a minute. You know what's really ridiculous?
[8758.94s -> 8765.98s]  I'm so glad that I was not in a call with somebody. I would have bet money that this
[8765.98s -> 8776.30s]  was not a woodcutter. If I was in a call with somebody and they were like, dude, that's a
[8776.30s -> 8780.86s]  woodcutter. Like pep and they were saying like Pepe laugh. And you guys were saying Pepe laugh
[8780.86s -> 8785.54s]  and shit. I would have, I would have been like, fine, put a thousand bucks up and I would have
[8785.54s -> 8817.61s]  lost. I need to eat something. Save the game. Good call. That's a very good call. Is the rest
[8817.61s -> 8822.39s]  of the stream going to be about, can you recognize a woodcutter? No, we'll move on probably pretty
[8822.39s -> 8842.87s]  shortly here. Probably like now I'll give you $10,000 to flip the truck. No, no, I'm serious.
[8843.43s -> 8859.35s]  There are 15,500 people here and that would like annoy and like irritate 15,000 people.
[8859.91s -> 8863.96s]  So essentially what that would be would be, I would be getting a dollar like per person
[8863.96s -> 8869.30s]  to like irritate the fuck out of everybody. And I don't, I don't, I kind of don't want to do that.
[8876.31s -> 8893.00s]  All right. Well, this is fine. I got to sleep. I need to eat something. I don't think I have any
[8893.00s -> 8902.33s]  food. Oh, I have this. Yeah. We're good. All right. Let's go see. Should I turn the power off and go
[8902.33s -> 8930.41s]  to bed? Maybe you should. I'll give you a thousand dollars. No one's giving me a thousand. No one's.
[8930.41s -> 8943.18s]  Okay. Don't even joke. What time is it? Is it really 1 AM? What is the sleep schedule I'm on?
[8943.18s -> 8949.86s]  Fuck. Well, I'm cutting another. Okay. I'm cutting another tree down then. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to
[8949.86s -> 8958.81s]  cut another tree down because it won't fit. Actually it really might not. You're right.
[8960.89s -> 8973.24s]  Let me spread this out because this will be a disaster. I'm going to go very slow.
[8973.24s -> 8980.74s]  I'm going to bring the chainsaw too. There might be stuff at his property I can cut down.
[8980.74s -> 8993.30s]  It's not going to be a disaster. It'll be fine. All right. Oh, let's bring the chainsaw
[8993.30s -> 9021.16s]  that in the car. I'm not trying to cut this. Go back to bed. I've watched this video on
[9021.16s -> 9039.18s]  fail army a hundred times. What does that mean? All right. This is empty. So I have to fill that
[9039.18s -> 9043.85s]  back up if I have any. All right. Here's the plan. I'm going to go make a bunch of money.
[9043.85s -> 9068.58s]  How am I on gas? I could use some. Fail army? I saw the stream five days ago. That's weird.
[9068.58s -> 9097.24s]  Can I see how much is in there? Empty. Okay. All right. I got a full tank of gas. Okay. We're good.
[9097.24s -> 9102.82s]  Full tank of gas. Bring the gas can because after I do this, I'm going to town to get more gas.
[9102.82s -> 9114.60s]  Car is almost ready. I can just need to fill it with gas and I can drive it. Do not flip the car
[9114.60s -> 9122.78s]  under any circumstance. Do not flip the car under any circumstance. Don't do it. It's not funny.
[9122.78s -> 9128.78s]  It's not a joke. It would be annoying because you just wasted like 35 straight minutes cutting
[9128.78s -> 9136.02s]  wood. Jeremy, I know you think you're quite the comedian, but this is not the time to do that.
[9136.02s -> 9146.60s]  And a lot of people are going to think that that was on purpose, but it was not. And I,
[9147.64s -> 9151.80s]  you gotta be fucking kidding me, man. I'm going to quit the game. Honest to God,
[9152.68s -> 9159.56s]  you don't even tell me that like this is, that's unfucking believable. And it looks so stupid.
[9160.36s -> 9166.62s]  It's so stupid because it looks like I have fucking meant to do that. I'm fine. It's fine.
[9166.62s -> 9177.82s]  I can just reverse. That looks so shit and so planned. That looked so fucking fake and
[9177.82s -> 9201.90s]  it's annoying that it did. I can't fucking believe it, man. I can't believe it. I can't,
[9202.54s -> 9211.90s]  I cannot believe it. Scripted fucking bullshit. I can't believe how fucking fake that looked.
[9211.90s -> 9234.95s]  In fact, I can't, I really thought that this did not drop off like this. I thought it
[9234.95s -> 9239.86s]  was just here and that I could just go left. Because remember, I was up in the truck like this
[9239.86s -> 9243.78s]  and I'm driving this way and it's like, take the left. I didn't think there was a divot right there
[9243.78s -> 9249.83s]  and it doesn't matter what I say. I'm like a try hard funny Andy that like thought that was funny
[9249.83s -> 9267.93s]  and there's nothing I can do about that. I used a lever. Dude, come on. I, my life is a, I can't.
[9269.93s -> 9277.94s]  So scripted and so just fake. He's doing the thing. Look at, he's like talking about like,
[9278.34s -> 9293.85s]  don't mess it up, Jeremy. I fell down guys. I'm so mad right now. You have no idea. Load the save.
[9296.17s -> 9328.47s]  Quiet. Not you, me. Just put it like under here. Would that work? I don't think that's doing
[9328.47s -> 9410.36s]  anything. I'm just going to reload the save. Far away. What if I just used it? I can't use it again.
[9410.36s -> 9435.11s]  Guys, I'm fucked I think. Put it in neutral. How do I do neutral? All right, all right, all right.
[9435.11s -> 9480.74s]  I swear to God, this wasn't on purpose. I promise. I pull it like from here. There it goes. It's
[9480.74s -> 9499.61s]  fucked. The back side. There it goes. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[9499.61s -> 9548.47s]  I can't believe it. Can I get out now? I might be able to get out now. I have to reload the save.
[9548.47s -> 9568.14s]  Pull the front right. Front right side. No, it's wedged in here. This shit ain't going anywhere,
[9568.14s -> 9595.02s]  guys. It's like just stuck here forever. Yeah, this is copium. It really is. Ram it with the ATV.
[9595.02s -> 9623.37s]  Now, this is absolute copium and I, this is copium. It's copium. I need to reload the save,
[9623.37s -> 9676.15s]  which is, it's this one here, right? Turn off, turn this off. Turn everything off. Go to bed.
[9676.15s -> 9693.67s]  I'm not going to get stuck again. I, I will, this is the worst stream ever. That sucks so bad that
[9693.67s -> 9712.01s]  like I really did not mean to do that. It's like one o'clock in the morning. Just sleep until
[9712.01s -> 9733.06s]  six a.m. This was my first stream. Fuck it. I'm done. I'm out. Get in the fucking car.
[9734.02s -> 9746.31s]  Turn the fucking car on. Put it in one. And this is what I saw before. That looks like a level
[9746.31s -> 9827.34s]  fucking plane. What about the gas can? Check that rear view. No, no chainsaw. No, no, no, no, no.
[9827.34s -> 9843.29s]  No, I don't have time for that right now. It's the worst stream. Fuck. No, it can't be. No,
[9843.29s -> 9860.09s]  I'll fix it. I'll fix it. It can't be. It can't be. I'll fix it. Don't go down that way. I'll fix
[9860.09s -> 9882.82s]  it. I'll fix it. Let's go. I get five bucks for every log. This is going to be a fucking
[9882.82s -> 9906.12s]  millionaire at the end of this. Pull it closer. Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer. Oh my
[9906.12s -> 9933.66s]  God. Thank goodness. Just drive over it. That work. I'm not, no, no, no, no, I'm not. I'm not
[9933.66s -> 9974.07s]  fucking around. Does work. All right. I thought you were lying. I have 265 bucks. All right. We're
[9974.07s -> 9981.16s]  in business now. Let's fucking go. All right. Plan. Here comes a plan. We're going to get the
[9981.16s -> 9993.53s]  plan going. Plan. Load up the car with gas. You're going to come out of the birth canal.
[9993.53s -> 10010.94s]  I'm not coming out of the birth canal. Full tank of gas. Let's go. I got 300 bucks. I'm ready to
[10010.94s -> 10023.80s]  do it. Let's go. Stream just started. You just got here. Okay. This shit's empty. I need to fill
[10023.80s -> 10032.92s]  that back up. I've got a full tank of gas of almost 300 bucks. I can go into town, which led me.
[10032.92s -> 10039.59s]  Let's take a look here. If I keep going just to the left straight, go through the Moses tunnel
[10039.59s -> 10050.70s]  and we'll go back into town. It's the worst stream ever. It's not the worst. No, it's not.
[10050.70s -> 10081.21s]  I refuse to believe it. Nope. Sorry. Nope. Okay. Here we go. Stay left. Bang a left here.
[10082.46s -> 10093.54s]  We're going to go buy some equipment for that car. It can't possibly be the worst stream. He made a
[10093.54s -> 10121.85s]  silly cats being mean. It's okay. We don't have to listen to them. You and me, we get it. I can.
[10122.49s -> 10130.84s]  Is that another potato? No, I do have to. I'm going to buy some snacks. I think because I'm
[10130.84s -> 10152.18s]  going to run out of food zero as soon here. Snack shack was down here, right? Isn't the snack shack
[10152.18s -> 10170.73s]  over here? I don't know, dude. Every fucking house is identical and every road is identical.
[10174.09s -> 10207.11s]  One of these houses is the snack shack. Okay. Turn this off. Let's go. Let me just got a damn thing.
[10207.11s -> 10223.85s]  Fill this up. I got cash. I'm good. I can buy another gas tank. Okay. So it's 17 bucks to fill
[10223.85s -> 10236.25s]  this can full can. Very nice. All right, let's go. Now we're working. Now we're working. Let's go.
[10236.25s -> 10242.94s]  All right. What do I want from here? Oh shit. No, I don't have that kind of money.
[10242.94s -> 10253.27s]  Um, summer tire. A muffler. I could buy, I could afford one of these mufflers.
[10253.27s -> 10266.68s]  Should I get a new muffler? I have a torch. Dent repair kit. Rust repair. Something useful. Yeah.
[10266.68s -> 10275.14s]  Wouldn't a muffler be useful? What about a shock? Sport shock. Like that would be pretty,
[10275.14s -> 10288.31s]  pretty sick, right? Rust repair. Rust repair kit. Okay. Oh yeah. The car is rusted. You're right.
[10288.31s -> 10307.35s]  Good idea. What else should I get? I'm thinking maybe suspension. Dent repair. Yeah. I don't want
[10307.35s -> 10317.16s]  to buy too much shit though. Another gas can. I don't think I have, do they sell it? It's in paint.
[10318.87s -> 10323.27s]  Gray paint. All right. What kind of, what color do I want the car to be? Uh, Robin's egg blue.
[10330.26s -> 10337.67s]  Now how long does that last? Or do I have to buy like a shitload of them? Does it last forever?
[10346.79s -> 10353.35s]  Ooh, a steering wheel. Cool. What's that? I'm, I probably should get like some shock or something,
[10353.35s -> 10378.42s]  right? I shouldn't I? No, get food. Oh, you're right. Okay. I can't get that. All right. I'm
[10378.42s -> 10382.26s]  going to buy a bunch of poutine because I need to buy it. I don't, I can't afford it. I can't
[10382.26s -> 10388.14s]  afford it. All right. Okay. Okay. I have enough to, that engine is going to be pretty cool. One of
[10388.14s -> 10403.34s]  it. Oh, no eyelashes. Yep. Buy a lottery ticket. All right. I got a full tank of gas, a full gas
[10403.34s -> 10421.42s]  can, a under glow kit. No shifter. Oh, this is kind of classic. This is kind of classic. No, no,
[10421.42s -> 10425.91s]  not this one. The other one is all right. All right. All right. All right. I have 50 bucks.
[10425.91s -> 10429.35s]  I don't want to waste it because I need gas. I want to be able to afford gas. Okay.
[10430.66s -> 10438.57s]  So Snack Shack is right here, right? That's Snack Shack. Yep. Okay. They're right next to each
[10438.57s -> 10468.04s]  other. Drive carefully, please. We're good. Vroom, vroom, crappy car mods. Reddit. What the fuck did
[10468.04s -> 10481.38s]  you say? I'm sorry. I got like really angry. Calm down. Woof, woof, woof, woof. What do I mean
[10481.38s -> 10504.52s]  locked? Are they closed? Come on. Are they open in 20 minutes? Worse than Skate 3. Everybody that's
[10504.52s -> 10509.77s]  saying that this is the worst stream I've ever done. You are going to be timed out for five
[10509.77s -> 10515.11s]  minutes for each offense on your. Okay. For your first offense, it's five minutes. Your second
[10515.11s -> 10529.02s]  offense, it's 20 minutes. Your third offense is permanent. Deal with that one. Deal with that one.
[10540.95s -> 10553.27s]  Imagine waiting 50 minutes in front of a restaurant to go in. I've done it before,
[10553.27s -> 10560.87s]  not 50 minutes, but like it probably 20. So maybe some of you guys can relate to this. We'll find
[10560.87s -> 10568.78s]  out. Being on a reverse sleep schedule and having, and like, let's say you, let's say you're getting
[10568.78s -> 10575.11s]  up a long time. I haven't been like this in a long time, but for a while, especially when I was in
[10575.11s -> 10582.57s]  Massachusetts and I lived in Massachusetts, I was sleeping at, I mean, I would start my stream at
[10582.57s -> 10588.70s]  seven or eight o'clock at night Eastern. And I, my stream would stop around like 12, one, two
[10588.70s -> 10594.36s]  o'clock in the morning a lot of times. Right. Every, almost every stream was like that. So I
[10594.36s -> 10600.36s]  would be ending my stream at like two, three AM sometimes. And like, I would maybe take a shower
[10600.36s -> 10605.45s]  after streaming and relax. Very good. What am I going to do for food? And there were breakfast
[10605.45s -> 10613.74s]  places that opened at like five AM. So, I mean, I was, I was essentially on a complete reverse
[10613.74s -> 10621.91s]  schedule. I was going to bed at, I want to say I was sleeping a lot of times at like eight, nine,
[10621.91s -> 10624.39s]  10 o'clock in the morning and waking up at like four or five o'clock in the afternoon.
[10626.17s -> 10630.89s]  So I would, sometimes you, I'm really hungry and it's like, fuck, I can't go, I haven't gone to the
[10630.89s -> 10637.77s]  grocery store in a few days. I don't have anything in the fridge. So like four 30 would roll around
[10637.77s -> 10646.31s]  and I'd be like, fuck, I'm, fuck, man, I'm ready to go. And I would go and kind of, I wanted to like
[10646.31s -> 10652.07s]  eat and I want to beat all the old people to the restaurant because they all showed up at like five
[10652.07s -> 10659.66s]  36 AM. So I would get in the car at like four 30, get there at like four 45 and just be like,
[10659.66s -> 10666.09s]  I'm ready. And they would open and be like, like, oh, hey, how are you doing? Oh yeah. Good morning.
[10666.09s -> 10671.75s]  Good morning. It's sunny out there. I don't know. I don't know what the people maybe thought I did,
[10673.16s -> 10677.64s]  but like I was always not always. And I didn't do this that often, by the way, this happened
[10677.64s -> 10682.50s]  to make maybe like a total of five to 10 times my whole life. I would be there like at the crack of
[10682.50s -> 10688.87s]  the door opening and I didn't want coffee, right? Because I was going to be going to sleep. So it'd
[10688.87s -> 10695.67s]  be like, no, no, no, no coffee, no coffee. Uh, but I would love the extra large, uh, corned beef hash
[10695.67s -> 10713.43s]  and three eggs breakfast place and a big orange juice. I would love it. Oh, it's open. These are
[10713.43s -> 10728.09s]  expensive corned beef hash and eggs is my favorite breakfast in the world and nothing compares. So
[10728.09s -> 10734.70s]  there you go. I got here right when they opened, I cleaned them out and now I'm leaving. Do they
[10734.70s -> 10749.50s]  have anything else? Is there a drive through fry basket? I don't think they have a fry basket in
[10749.50s -> 10766.52s]  here, man. Okay. I got everything I need. Let's go. Let's go work on the car. Corned beef is
[10766.52s -> 10788.06s]  terrible for you. It's so good though. But I mean, everything is terrible for you. As long as you're
[10788.06s -> 10793.91s]  not eating corned beef for every meal, every day of your life. We have the same conversation. We
[10793.91s -> 10800.73s]  talked about like fast food, right? That you eat McDonald's. Fucking piece of shit. You're disgusting.
[10801.61s -> 10806.09s]  If you eat McDonald's like a few times a month, you're fine. It's you're going to be fine.
[10807.56s -> 10827.21s]  All right. I got to find the exit. This is not the exit. That's copium. That's not copium.
[10830.15s -> 10834.63s]  Did I drive on somebody's fucking front deck? What the hell is going on? I didn't lose anything,
[10834.63s -> 10857.48s]  right? That's not copium. It really isn't or McChickens. Just do if you feel like having
[10857.48s -> 10861.88s]  like a brisket sandwich, eat it, but don't eat a brisket sandwich every single day.
[10862.52s -> 10866.54s]  If you like chicken nuggets from McDonald's or Wendy's or Burger King, whatever, that's great.
[10866.54s -> 10880.58s]  They're awesome. Don't eat it every day. There. That's it. Done. Done. That's it. And like taking
[10880.58s -> 10899.24s]  some more good stuff too. To, you know, to even out the bad stuff. I don't want to. I want. Well,
[10899.24s -> 10906.74s]  I mean, here. You could like incorporate. You just incorporate some more greens and shit.
[10907.38s -> 10924.68s]  You maybe cook with some like better oil, right? Just keep an eye on your cholesterol. Like whenever
[10924.68s -> 10936.46s]  you get like a blood test from the doctor, just go right. Make sure you like your, you know,
[10936.46s -> 10949.70s]  all your levels are okay and be going, be healthy and be happy. You'll be fine. Or don't eat like
[10949.70s -> 10956.25s]  shit. Nobody cares. Yeah, but you will though. Let me tell you, as somebody that's old man,
[10958.31s -> 10965.43s]  you're going to want to treat your body at least all right in your teens and twenties. Trust me.
[10967.43s -> 10983.61s]  You really are. Dad, shut up. I'm serious. Let me be the one to tell you that I said the same stuff
[10983.61s -> 10991.82s]  when I was like 20, 25, whatever. I don't give a shit when I'm older. Who fucking cares? I'm going
[10991.82s -> 11011.74s]  to be old. I'm not that old. 20. Yeah, whatever. You're a wise elder now. Oh, somebody what happened?
[11011.74s -> 11017.02s]  Sorry. What happened to my house? Honestly though, did I leave the door open the whole time?
[11020.92s -> 11026.26s]  You're like 50. Oh, we're going to turn this. We're going to make this a beauty.
[11028.38s -> 11064.74s]  All right. Rust repair kit. How do I use it? I only get to use it once. I use it one time. Nice.
[11064.74s -> 11075.27s]  Very nice. Okay. Dent repair kit. All right. Is there any major dents to take care of?
[11075.27s -> 11087.70s]  Probably. Should I just use it on this car? Like right here? Is this working?
[11087.70s -> 11107.53s]  Am I making dents in the car? Oh, whatever. Oh, I'm just going to burp. What do we have on
[11107.53s -> 11121.66s]  the to-do list? All right. That's all done. Oh, my potatoes. 36%. Do I have to water them?
[11121.66s -> 11152.76s]  What the fuck? That's my car. Should I not do this yet? And is this infinite? It runs out.
[11152.76s -> 11187.27s]  It's infinite. It's no, it's not. Test it out. I think it might be infinite. I think so. I think
[11187.27s -> 11191.42s]  yeah, it's infinite. It is. All right. Well, let's, I know we could do the rust and everything first,
[11191.42s -> 11211.66s]  but whatever. This is looking all right. Leave some parts while it's cool. No, I want it to be
[11211.66s -> 11226.02s]  blue. So I have to buy a shitload of those rust repair kits. We have to do way more wood. Yeah,
[11226.02s -> 11231.54s]  just eat all right. Don't, you know, if you can, sometimes it can be hard. Trust me. I get it.
[11232.10s -> 11256.10s]  It's empty. You actually can run out. Did it go in? That looks way better than it did before.
[11256.10s -> 11263.29s]  And whatever, who cares? Okay. So now, oh, I got this blue. I'll save that. Can I drive this thing?
[11263.29s -> 11276.25s]  Does this thing actually drive? Can I actually drive the car? I can. Oh, hell yeah. All right.
[11276.25s -> 11313.02s]  Let's get gas in this thing. Very nice. Pop the trunk. Let's put this in here. Okay. Nice.
[11313.58s -> 11322.86s]  Everything will be secure in here. That's so much better than the trunk. How do I get it off this
[11322.86s -> 11345.62s]  thing here? I just pull this out. I have to jack it up. Um, how do I, I don't, how do you do that?
[11345.62s -> 11360.82s]  I really kind of don't understand. That's not a jack. Oh, do I have a jack? Oh, can I just
[11360.82s -> 11372.81s]  drive off of it? It's in the trunk. Um, it is not in the trunk. The jack on the front,
[11373.45s -> 11383.43s]  it's a log splitter. That's a tire pump. It's a watering can. Wait, there's no water in it.
[11383.99s -> 11391.24s]  That's a tire pump. It's in the truck bed. That's another hoist puller. It's not a jack.
[11391.96s -> 11406.82s]  I mean, can I just pull it off though? I don't see it. I think that's just going to have to,
[11407.46s -> 11418.57s]  I think I have to buy it. Oh, put the food in the fridge. Yep. That's true. I got to piss.
[11419.21s -> 11435.50s]  Did you take a fat dump in bed today? Kind of a weird question. A very strange question.
[11435.50s -> 11449.34s]  Use the hoist on the front to lift the front. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I'm going to
[11449.34s -> 11471.66s]  run out of this stuff soon too. What's in the freezer? Okay. We're good. We're good. Wait,
[11471.66s -> 11482.76s]  if there's no electricity, how's the fridge work? Right. I got to pee. We'll be right back.
[11483.32s -> 11487.72s]  I'm not even close to being done. I'll be right back. Give me like two, three minutes.
[11487.72s -> 11513.16s]  All my songs got moved. Going to the folder and they're not synced up here. Sorry about that.
[11513.16s -> 11771.08s]  I'll fix it. Here, pee. I'm back. I didn't, I wanted to speak really softly so I didn't
[11771.08s -> 11807.37s]  scare the shit out of people. The hot boxed his house. Ready? That was a long piss. I refilled
[11807.37s -> 11815.37s]  my water and tea. Water and tea together. It's a water. It's a tea. I can hear your hot box.
[11820.47s -> 11827.67s]  Okay. So I need to sleep. What time is it? What time is that in? That's six o'clock at night,
[11828.31s -> 11835.85s]  five o'clock at night. What is it? So I'm not going to bed yet. What can I do? Let me see if
[11835.85s -> 11857.40s]  I can get this off the thing here because I don't really want it on there. How do I get this off?
[11857.40s -> 11898.76s]  They like bolt it in. Inflate the tires. Oh, that's a smart idea. Keep pumping them.
[11898.76s -> 11906.49s]  I don't want it past like 32, 30. What do you mean? 30? You out of your mind? You don't want
[11906.49s -> 11921.66s]  a hundred PSI in your fucking tire? What are you talking about? No, like 32, 30. Not, you out of
[11921.66s -> 11939.08s]  your mind? 35, 32. Herman has only ridden a bike. All right. I might've gotten the log cutting thing
[11939.08s -> 11946.04s]  wrong, but like 30 and 35 PSI on your tires is like safe. It's not, you're not supposed to have,
[11946.04s -> 11959.37s]  fucking, are you crazy? I know, I know this. If I know one thing is, is this 70 PSI. I would not
[11959.37s -> 11968.25s]  do that. Yeah. Come on. Okay. So now that's good. I need to go. I know what I'm doing before I go to
[11968.25s -> 11979.45s]  bed. All right. This game's fun. I am going to cut down some trees and I'm going to make a shitload
[11979.45s -> 11990.50s]  more money. How's that sound? Punk. That's right. Yeah. I'm talking to you. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11990.50s -> 11998.66s]  On the second seat in the couch. You with the brown hair. Talking to you. Yeah. Put the spaghetti
[11998.66s -> 12006.42s]  down and let's talk. Somebody was just like, what the fuck? Somebody's eating spaghetti with
[12006.42s -> 12014.22s]  brown hair on the second seat of a couch. This 15 plus thousand people here. The person that was
[12014.22s -> 12023.90s]  just eating spaghetti on the second seat in their couch with brown hair. Me? Wait, what?
[12028.82s -> 12035.54s]  Do you guys, I don't know. Do you remember when I think of one, didn't one day I like look right
[12035.54s -> 12043.26s]  in the camera and go like, like, Hey, Hey, Michael Anderson, what's going on, man? I used to do that
[12043.26s -> 12052.54s]  a lot, didn't I? And also it's just like, what the fuck? Oh, like how did he, what is he talking
[12052.54s -> 12085.93s]  about? Like, Hey, Dave Smith. Oh, I can cut a pine tree. Okay. These are chunky. I thought I
[12085.93s -> 12108.54s]  couldn't cut these. Okay. I'm just going to load the truck. All right. That should be good. Let's
[12108.54s -> 12115.54s]  load the truck up and then I'm going to sleep and then we're going to turn this in all chat
[12115.54s -> 12140.22s]  individually. Yeah. Oh, well I can deliver pizza, right? Or something. Okay. Let's park it right
[12140.22s -> 12159.90s]  here. Oh, I'm going to get dark. I got to hurry up. Hopefully I have enough gas to cut this.
[12159.90s -> 12182.54s]  This is less efficient, but then just wait. I just got to get it over here. So what is the next thing
[12182.54s -> 12189.10s]  that I actually really do need? Like no messing around. Like, what do I need actually? I need
[12189.18s -> 12203.77s]  something, right? Sugar shack. How do I build a sugar shack? These are massive. These logs are
[12203.77s -> 12219.74s]  so much bigger than I thought they were. Shit. It's going to be difficult. Um, okay. I'll go get
[12219.74s -> 12238.42s]  these. I wish I could sprint. Do pizza stuff. Hold on. Did you cut down a rubber tree? I don't
[12238.42s -> 12272.57s]  think so. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Everything's fine. All right. Let's see if these,
[12272.57s -> 12279.14s]  if I cut this up, if it, if it fits, hopefully this gas, please tell me this gas. Come on.
[12279.14s -> 12293.43s]  How come this is so spooky? Um, I think it's just a flashlight outside in a game. I think it's just
[12293.43s -> 12311.96s]  at night is scary. So a sugar shack will do it. I'm almost time for me to sleep.
[12313.83s -> 12330.71s]  Spider-man is going to get you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
[12330.71s -> 12336.94s]  hey, what, what, what, what, what? Hey, hey, who's doing this? Who has my car? What the fuck? What
[12336.94s -> 12354.49s]  the fuck? Who's driving my car? I put the brake on, didn't I? Oh shit. Brake is on, isn't it?
[12355.13s -> 12371.19s]  I could have sworn the parking brake was on. I, it's on. What? Hey, I actually thought you guys
[12371.19s -> 12398.42s]  weren't kidding around. Out of gas. How do I turn the lights off? I don't want the battery to run
[12398.42s -> 12413.11s]  out. Turn the lights off. How the fuck is this thing out of gas? I might be in trouble here.
[12413.11s -> 12427.43s]  I was here two hours ago doing, doing the same exact thing, but somebody just asked for it.
[12428.07s -> 12433.94s]  So they were asking, how's my TikTok voice? And I'll tell you, it's really doing pretty well.
[12434.02s -> 12437.91s]  Although I'm trying hard not to make it sound like that. So it's still there,
[12438.63s -> 12441.82s]  but it's not as bad. I think it's a seasonal thing.
[12443.26s -> 12448.33s]  Now I started talking like that and now it's there. This is empty, huh?
[12449.37s -> 12465.03s]  Fuck. Um, this is bad. This thing has a full tank, but I can't drive it. Can I, can I just drive off
[12465.03s -> 12476.17s]  this thing? It's got a ton of gas. See if I can get to town. Call Martin. Oh my God, you're right.
[12476.73s -> 12535.72s]  High five five. It's what? 8 a.m.? Martin's on a reverse schedule. He's at the local diner right
[12535.72s -> 12555.18s]  now. The first person there. No, he wouldn't be actually. 7 a.m.? Old people central. He's
[12555.18s -> 12591.70s]  still sleeping. How are the potatoes? 44%. Hell yeah. This is kind of cool too. I haven't even
[12591.70s -> 12624.18s]  used this. Ooh, really? How much should I do this? This'll work, right? No energy first thing in the
[12624.18s -> 12646.39s]  morning. I have that. No, the meters are backwards. I don't want to use that. I have two eggs. Let's
[12646.39s -> 12652.86s]  save the game here. Oh my God. No electricity. All right, Martin, will you get up? Wake up, please.
[12652.86s -> 12662.68s]  What time? It's 8 30. I'm stranded here. I don't have any gas in my car and I need to ride to town.
[12662.68s -> 12702.84s]  How long? When does Martin get up? I have to save. It's 4 p.m. Right before he streams. That's so bad.
[12703.32s -> 12713.34s]  Okay, I will tell you that moving to the west coast was really, really good for me because instead
[12713.34s -> 12720.44s]  of starting streams at like 7 p.m., 7 to 8 p.m. my local time, I couldn't really do that anymore.
[12722.39s -> 12729.29s]  That was just not going to be really efficient at all because being three hours behind eastern time,
[12731.46s -> 12738.07s]  I couldn't start my streams at 7 p.m. local time. There's no way. I just wouldn't be able to do that.
[12738.07s -> 12743.11s]  That would be so late for everybody. And even starting at like four, like three, four-ish,
[12744.12s -> 12748.44s]  is still really late for people. That's still 7 p.m. eastern, but it's 4 p.m. local.
[12749.24s -> 12752.76s]  So it actually, I've been on like a better schedule since I've moved.
[12753.32s -> 12763.29s]  So moving across the whole country made me get up better. It's crazy. All right, turn the generator
[12763.29s -> 12769.26s]  off. I'm calling this guy again. It was just enough to save the game, thank God. All right,
[12769.74s -> 12793.13s]  it's like noon. Hang up. Yeah, dude, I'm on my way to pick you up. All right,
[12793.13s -> 12824.14s]  I need the gas can. Where is it? Is he actually coming or is he, is it not real?
[12824.94s -> 12841.69s]  Taking like an hour or something? Will he drive me back? I don't have to walk back, right?
[12851.02s -> 12874.18s]  He crashed. That's like not, right? Click the jack stands. What? How did I not know that?
[12874.18s -> 12892.87s]  What's up, man? Hey, what's up, man? Cars running just fine. Turns out I don't actually need you.
[12895.35s -> 12910.95s]  Thanks, dude. Appreciate it. You got a cool tire in there. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's mine.
[12911.51s -> 12948.82s]  That's mine. What the fuck? No, where's the, why do I, who puts a parking brake on right here?
[12948.82s -> 12967.72s]  Close the parking brake? Why is the parking, where's the parking brake on this car?
[12967.72s -> 12979.99s]  Damn it. How do I get a gas can back? What do I, do I have to, I have to call him back?
[12979.99s -> 13006.82s]  Don't even tell me that, seriously. Martin's already on the road. I have to go fucking hunt
[13006.82s -> 13035.90s]  him down. You gotta be shitting me. How do I get out of, he went this way. I don't know where,
[13035.90s -> 13058.50s]  I don't know where he went. He's in town. Go to the town. Oh, the lost items guy. That's right.
[13058.50s -> 13067.27s]  Okay. Where's the lost items guy? What a pain in the ass. I gotta go the other way then.
[13067.27s -> 13075.82s]  This is the wrong way. Is there a faster way to shift? Cause it's not one, two, three, four,
[13075.82s -> 13086.04s]  five anymore. How do I shift? I don't, I don't want to like look down here. Oh my God. This is
[13086.04s -> 13095.64s]  such a pain in the ass. What the hell? Um, I'm just going to go to town. How am I going to get gas?
[13099.85s -> 13107.54s]  I'm talking about to go to reverse, not like gear shift. I don't know how I'm going to,
[13107.54s -> 13111.62s]  I gotta go talk to the guy. Whatever. Let's go to town. I could restart the save.
[13115.51s -> 13124.30s]  I think I'm just going to restart the save. Yeah. Fuck this. That was like, yeah, that was like
[13124.30s -> 13140.92s]  five minutes ago. Okay. Same thing applies here. This time I'm actually going to get in the car,
[13140.92s -> 13144.20s]  which is so, I don't know what happened. He just, I maybe got annoyed that I wasn't there.
[13144.84s -> 13167.75s]  Okay. He's on his way. I hear something's running. All right. Okay. All right. Gas can pick it up.
[13167.75s -> 13173.34s]  In the meantime, I actually can do this because it's going to take a minute to get here stuff.
[13173.34s -> 13180.30s]  That's cut up. Just put it in the trunk because I know I'm going to use it. I might as well just
[13180.30s -> 13203.67s]  get this out of the way. Is this cut? No, I don't think so. It does not look cut. Are you
[13203.67s -> 13209.70s]  torturing yourself with this game? No, I'm, if I wasn't enjoying it, at least it's fun to play
[13209.70s -> 13214.18s]  just to fuck around. I would not be playing it if I didn't enjoy it at least enough to play it.
[13214.18s -> 13239.34s]  So don't worry. I'm having fun. Rewater the plants. That's a good call. Yep. I don't know
[13239.34s -> 13264.10s]  where the fuck it went. I got to go. What's up? Let's go. You are adorable today, Jason.
[13287.90s -> 13318.31s]  Let's go. Oh, wait. He actually, what? What the fuck? I'm not drinking or smelling the gas.
[13319.29s -> 13324.49s]  I'm just holding it over here. Oh my God. Damn it. I'm not driving with Martin anymore.
[13325.29s -> 13339.85s]  I'm not, I'm not getting in the car with Martin. So how do I get back?
[13340.41s -> 13368.66s]  How am I supposed to get back to my house? Bro, where are you going? Martin? Martin? Hey,
[13368.66s -> 13400.70s]  are you going to wait here? Thanks, Martin. Wait, did we just lock ourselves out of here?
[13406.44s -> 13428.82s]  Please remember where this is because I don't. Right near the big Christmas tree. Where's the,
[13428.82s -> 13440.30s]  what do I do? Go in his house. That's Martin's house? Okay. That's Martin's house right there.
[13440.30s -> 13462.57s]  I got to try to burn that into memory somehow. It's like to the right of the church. Okay. So
[13462.57s -> 13468.63s]  from the church's front entrance, it's like to the right and straight. All right, guys. So
[13469.59s -> 13486.79s]  how am I doing? Can I actually get back to the house from here? This is Snack Shack.
[13488.10s -> 13495.18s]  I think the gas station is over here. I look like such a fucking weirdo. I'm just walking
[13495.18s -> 13509.32s]  around the streets holding a gas canister. What am I doing with this over there? Person? Okay.
[13510.34s -> 13532.31s]  I only have $26. I got to be careful. All right, let's do it. I just need to gas. I can fill this
[13532.31s -> 13548.18s]  whole tank here and then I can bring the, I can fill the truck. Okay. So I got to go find Martin.
[13548.18s -> 13559.45s]  Okay. So this, I got what I needed. The church is over here and it's over this way. Okay. All right.
[13559.45s -> 13585.16s]  Let's go. How do you get your maple syrup bar to go down? You have to drink maple syrup. So Martin's
[13585.16s -> 13592.84s]  house is over here. Okay. As long as I can have landmarks burnt in, I'll be able to know where I
[13592.84s -> 13607.88s]  am. Okay. Cool. That's what I wanted for free. So is he in the house? It was a look behind the
[13607.88s -> 13636.33s]  house. Wood spoiler. Why would you want, I don't, a wood spoiler? This is a shelf. All right, dude,
[13636.33s -> 13685.46s]  let's go. I don't know what you mean by this, but I somehow get it somehow. Somebody said this is
[13685.46s -> 13693.14s]  like when I bring my TV to my friend's house. What do you, you mean like you're holding a fucking big
[13693.14s -> 13703.30s]  ass TV? What do you mean? Like you sit there with it on your lap, bringing a big TV to my friend's
[13703.30s -> 13729.74s]  house. Well, so you guys can play like smash brothers at like zero milliseconds. All right.
[13729.74s -> 13736.55s]  Thanks a lot, man. Give me out, give me out this fucking car right now. Give me the fuck out of
[13736.55s -> 13756.07s]  this car. Get me out of this car and give me my shelf. All right, let's go. We're good. That looks
[13756.07s -> 13767.83s]  great. I promise that one day I will drive this car. I can spray paint it. I can spray paint it.
[13767.83s -> 13774.20s]  All right. Yeah. All right. We're going all night. I'm fucking, I'm ready. I'm into this now.
[13789.50s -> 13811.88s]  No, dude, we got to play in my CRT TV. Otherwise I can't do my chic 50 hit combo. I'm going to
[13811.88s -> 13819.13s]  chop up so much more wood. You have no idea. Yeah. You guys don't even have any idea how much more
[13819.13s -> 13825.21s]  wood is going to get chopped in this thing. Get ready to snooze. I'll be ready to go to sleep.
[13826.07s -> 13848.70s]  This is not going to be an exciting one. We'll get to the truck. Oh yeah. What happened here?
[13848.70s -> 13863.75s]  Oh, when it backed up. Right, right, right. Okay. That's a lot. Um, this is going to make me some
[13863.75s -> 13869.13s]  money. I'm going to bring, this is probably stupid what I'm doing. I'm going to bring the truck and
[13869.13s -> 13876.14s]  the chainsaw and the cutting machine to that guy's house. And then we're going to just cut a shit
[13876.14s -> 13880.70s]  little wood. I'm going to make like a thousand dollars. I'm going to put a $1,000 engine in that
[13880.70s -> 13907.13s]  car and beautiful. Let's just take what I have now. I fill it with gas. You can't cut the trees
[13907.13s -> 13917.24s]  around his place. Oh shit. Well, nevermind. Don't use the whole thing. Don't dump it either. All
[13917.24s -> 13926.09s]  right. What's the, how much is in here? I need enough for this. How much is in the actual tank
[13926.09s -> 13936.68s]  here now? All right. That's good. That's good. There's plenty of gas now in this car. It was
[13936.68s -> 13941.56s]  moving. The car was moving. The car was moving. Did you see the car move? I did. The parking
[13941.56s -> 13950.63s]  brake is on. Why is it moving like this? Why is it moving? I have the parking brake on. What?
[13958.23s -> 13997.96s]  It's too up. It's what? Dude, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[14005.85s -> 14029.98s]  Can I suck it out of here? Can I suck it out? Wait, excuse me. I thought there was no nothing
[14029.98s -> 14049.26s]  left in there. What? I thought there was nothing left. What is going on here? I want to tell me
[14049.26s -> 14079.02s]  how much is left in the tank. What happened? Why is the HUD turned off? Okay. Very good. I'm very
[14079.02s -> 14090.49s]  happy about this. Let's close that up. Let's cut some more wood. I'm ready. I have a bunch of logs
[14090.49s -> 14101.98s]  here. I don't think I can fit very much more than this. So he's happy. I'm very happy. I'm doing
[14101.98s -> 14111.88s]  great. Hopefully you're doing great too. I hope so. Smoke on stream. I'm not going to smoke. It's
[14111.88s -> 14118.12s]  not even 420 anymore in England. So whatever. What's wrong? Oh, I need to drink maple syrup.
[14118.12s -> 14143.21s]  I'm going to die. Go. I might only be able to do one more little batch of this. Can we,
[14143.21s -> 14157.74s]  Jerma, can we do a race before the five hour mark? What do you mean? I don't know what that means.
[14159.46s -> 14165.78s]  I've raced in the game, right? There's races. Yeah. My car's a piece of shit. How am I supposed
[14165.78s -> 14172.98s]  to do that? That car is, where's my car? Okay. Look, do you think I'm going to race with that?
[14172.98s -> 14189.18s]  Okay. Let's put this, I think that's all I can do. Maybe, maybe one more, but that's going to be it.
[14189.18s -> 14202.63s]  I think I don't think I can do much more than that. Maybe one more. What was it? Like 300 bucks?
[14203.35s -> 14215.45s]  Do the racing. I guys, the game, the map is in French and I don't even know where to go.
[14215.77s -> 14234.14s]  What do you want me to say? Well, I'll go do a race. Oh, I'm not mad. I'm fine.
[14242.89s -> 14250.68s]  I think I can get one more tree in here as long as I'm very safe about it. Dr. Thunder is good.
[14250.68s -> 14259.26s]  I have not had Dr. Thunder in a very long time. I think one more tree can fit in here and I'll
[14259.26s -> 14266.41s]  just drive over the thing. Nah, fuck it. I want money now. Let's go. I'll cut this last one.
[14266.97s -> 14301.98s]  That's enough. Can I turn this in at night or not? Any of you lore masters in here? All right. Good
[14301.98s -> 14329.29s]  night. Save the game. He's faking it. He knows how to speak French. Check out episode four of his
[14329.29s -> 14353.22s]  TF2 series with Sir He Literally Fluently Speaks French. Okay. I showed my sister one of your old
[14353.22s -> 14359.29s]  VODs and she said, she said he's good with it. What does that mean? I don't know. I have absolutely
[14359.29s -> 14378.84s]  no idea what that means. Okay. Now turn off the generator. How do I turn the lights off in the
[14378.84s -> 14391.24s]  car? I can't. Lights. Like I can't turn it off. It's right mouse bumper. All right. Tomorrow is
[14391.24s -> 14404.81s]  when I make the money and then I can finally drive that dumb ass car off the lot. I can finally get
[14404.81s -> 14422.42s]  that dumb ass car out of here. It's 5 30 in the morning. Plenty of time to eat something,
[14423.22s -> 14433.38s]  drink some syrup. My reserves are kind of going low though. Every night at the abandoned grocery
[14433.38s -> 14444.95s]  store. Car meat. Okay. We'll do that tomorrow night. I got to get this thing nice and souped up.
[14448.10s -> 14452.66s]  I need to rust repair kit, some more blue paint. So I need how many? I have one, two,
[14453.46s -> 14464.65s]  three, one, two, three, or five. I need like five or six rust repair kits and I need blue,
[14464.65s -> 14471.75s]  that light, I need like two cans of that light blue paint. So the spoiler be, I'm going to make
[14471.75s -> 14495.94s]  the spoiler clean. Okay. Sounds good. I need money though. So let's go. I swear to God,
[14495.94s -> 14520.92s]  I'm going to do that every fucking time. All right. So let me think here. All right. I,
[14533.64s -> 14543.54s]  one more tree. I want like three or $400. One more. I promise. Just whatever's right here.
[14543.54s -> 14570.36s]  You can't drive for shit. I'm using W. See me in with real car. Okay. Don't drive a real car with
[14570.36s -> 14577.46s]  WASD. I know that like they did it in a James Bond movie, but that's not how it works. He sat
[14577.46s -> 14588.25s]  down with his fucking Nintendo DS and drove the car around. True. Sure. All right. That's enough.
[14588.25s -> 14607.35s]  Fill it up. Cause it looks like there's a lot of room at the back of the yeah, right here.
[14607.35s -> 14615.98s]  There's tons of room. Can you parallel park? No, but you don't need to parallel park to be like
[14615.98s -> 14626.10s]  a good driver. I could, I could probably do it pretty well. I just don't really need to
[14628.98s -> 14641.21s]  parallel park these. I'm not going to say the rest of it, but a good one. That's copious.
[14641.21s -> 14650.23s]  What's with the copium comments today? That's not copium. I can't remember the last time that I
[14650.23s -> 14656.94s]  needed to parallel park. I just can't think of the last time I really had to do it where it was like,
[14656.94s -> 14667.82s]  Oh shit, I have to parallel park. All right. That's good. No more. I'm going to take this
[14667.82s -> 14681.16s]  came with me because I'm going to keep going to town and I'll fill it up. Wait, I can't do either
[14683.02s -> 14691.93s]  driving is stressful. It really is. If you driving can be pretty stressful. So no, I don't,
[14691.93s -> 14698.26s]  I wouldn't worry about that. Especially driving a big city or something. No,
[14698.26s -> 14714.70s]  no, don't let anybody tell you. It's not the one thing I will say that. I mean like Las Vegas is
[14714.70s -> 14724.73s]  seriously goaded Las Vegas. It's highway system is just a square. Is it? It's just a
[14725.21s -> 14730.63s]  it is so easy to drive in Las Vegas. It's unbelievable.
[14731.19s -> 14737.00s]  Driving around Boston was something I, I hated doing because it was, it was just,
[14737.00s -> 14747.59s]  it was terrifying. All the roads are like four inches wide in Vegas. Like there's so many
[14747.59s -> 14755.22s]  turning lanes. It's tons of like rotaries and it's just so much better. So much better.
[14757.30s -> 14760.82s]  I think Vegas is one of the best cities to drive in. It's one of the easiest to drive in,
[14760.82s -> 14767.54s]  in the country. I think now the drivers in Vegas, that's a little different story.
[14768.55s -> 14777.19s]  The roads are great. The drivers on the other hand would be way fucking better. It's actually
[14777.19s -> 14785.59s]  insane. How bad the drivers in Vegas actually are, which is crazy because I'm sitting there
[14785.59s -> 14789.75s]  going like, man, we have this huge, amazing, like it's everything's so easy to navigate.
[14790.47s -> 14805.67s]  Why are people driving around like fucking psychos? They're like you. No, I, no way, man.
[14810.65s -> 14816.17s]  I'm the person that in the car, when some crazy driver like blows by,
[14818.17s -> 14823.93s]  I'm the one that's going like, I'm going like 65 and I'm just like, my goodness, my goodness,
[14825.02s -> 14835.48s]  but be you be careful. That's me. That's what I do. I just shake my head. I'm just like,
[14836.28s -> 14839.88s]  unbelievable. I'm, you're going to fucking hurt someone. That's what I do.
[14840.60s -> 14866.82s]  Come on. 400 bucks. You've seen this. Hey, $400. You've seen this. All right. Let's keep going to
[14866.82s -> 14881.27s]  town and I'm going to keep going. All right. I got to go back, right? Because hold on. No,
[14881.27s -> 14895.98s]  no, no, just keep going this way. Don't lose the chainsaw. I won't. Yeah. I'm the person that
[14896.54s -> 14901.02s]  gasps when somebody drives by going like crazy. And look, I get like, oh,
[14902.71s -> 14909.19s]  60. You're just going to go 60, 65, 60, 60, 60 Andy. Don't be a fucking idiot in a car. Seriously.
[14909.99s -> 14917.51s]  Don't drive that fast. There's no reason to go like five to 10 miles per hour over the speed
[14917.51s -> 14921.03s]  limit. Like there really just kind of isn't like, just fucking be careful. Seriously guys,
[14921.03s -> 14939.50s]  don't be stupid. Like if you're on a road that's like 60, 65 and you're like, I'm going to go 90,
[14940.14s -> 14975.64s]  man, come on, just fucking chill. My car won't do 90. 90 is not five to, I'm just saying what is
[14975.64s -> 14988.98s]  this? Whoa. What's this? What's going on here? I already have a spoiler, but that's kind of cool.
[14988.98s -> 15008.86s]  Wheel spacer shifter. Hey, what's up Roger? What do you got in here? Ooh, metallic. I want that.
[15008.86s -> 15027.53s]  He's a hoods. Okay. Do I, can I afford any of these nitrous bottle blue bolts? These are way
[15027.53s -> 15034.14s]  too expensive. I can't afford any of these better trunk. I can't afford any of this. I need to just
[15034.14s -> 15065.58s]  do the basic shit first. Well, thanks for the metallic spray paint. I'm kidding. Relax. All
[15065.58s -> 15070.38s]  right. So now I just got to go to the gas station and get some more gas, get some more spray paint
[15070.38s -> 15081.90s]  and some more repair kits. It doesn't have to look good. It can look bad and go fast. Yeah.
[15081.90s -> 15089.77s]  That's true. But all right. Where's this guy? I always like, yeah, it's right there next to the
[15089.77s -> 15109.37s]  truck. Let me fill all this shit. I have plenty of money. So are these, are these both these the same?
[15109.37s -> 15134.73s]  Say Aaron, please. Aaron. He's the same thing, right? Yeah. That for the car that's on my lot.
[15134.73s -> 15140.12s]  We'll have a full tank. I wish I could, I buy another gas can somewhere. I feel like I need to.
[15140.76s -> 15148.36s]  All right. Hello. I'm here. I'm here to get a rust repair kit.
[15148.36s -> 15171.93s]  Oh, I need like four of these. This car is so beat up. 240 bucks. I could, should I get shocks?
[15171.93s -> 15195.35s]  Two of them? Can I afford to get these and put them in? Don't do it yet. Okay. I can't afford
[15195.35s -> 15212.63s]  these. Ooh, tires. Window tint. Oh yeah. Let's do, um, I don't know. What should I do? Green?
[15213.19s -> 15228.89s]  I need another repair kit, right? It doesn't have any left. Window film remover? Pruning?
[15229.53s -> 15270.55s]  Pruning loppers? What's a pruning lopper? What should I do? Get the under glow kit. All right.
[15270.55s -> 15278.54s]  I'm done. I bought all their, uh, repair kits. Let me see what I got. I have two repair kits,
[15279.34s -> 15296.52s]  green tint, the paint, gas. Let me fill the tank here. I don't have to worry about this. Do I need
[15296.52s -> 15311.86s]  to buy the loppers? Go to the maple syrup center. I will once I can actually drive this car
[15311.86s -> 15325.00s]  because it's so much better than the truck. Should I actually buy these loppers? I'm going
[15325.00s -> 15328.44s]  to buy them because if I'm, I don't know, I'm probably going to need them for some random
[15328.44s -> 15343.43s]  stupid thing. Do it now. Where's the maple syrup center? Is it one that says hmm? All right. So
[15343.43s -> 15361.78s]  where am I right now? I don't know how to get that from here. So how do I get that from here?
[15366.02s -> 15388.42s]  Right? Or it's right on the edge of town. Drop it off at your shit house. Jesus. This is it right
[15388.42s -> 15408.58s]  here then. Yeah. Federation syrup de-edible. Barrel. Place barrel of syrup here to sell.
[15408.58s -> 15418.84s]  Sap. Ooh. Hand sealer? Wait. Okay. Do I need to buy a bunch of this stuff? Okay. Sap spouts.
[15418.84s -> 15429.90s]  Okay. I'm going to get some of these. Should I buy more than one? Tubing roll? I'm just going
[15429.90s -> 15439.38s]  to get everything. I have 50 bucks. I probably should be careful. Tubing post? I need cans too.
[15440.02s -> 15464.10s]  Can crate? I'm going to run out of money. And then cans. How many cans should I get? A few? I don't
[15464.10s -> 15472.07s]  have enough for a post. I don't have enough money. Okay. I don't want to run out of money. So I'll
[15472.07s -> 15479.53s]  just take those. I'll just get this started. Kind of. I got to fix the car up still. So let's go.
[15479.53s -> 15494.92s]  I'm okay. I'm not going this way. This is going to take me forever to get home. Turn around. I need
[15494.92s -> 15503.74s]  lids for the cans. You don't have a canner or a barrel. Well, I'll get this later. All right. So
[15503.74s -> 15514.97s]  now I'm just going to drive straight and then take a right. Let's go. Grow weed. I've got potatoes
[15514.97s -> 15541.26s]  growing. Okay. What is that? Is that free? My God. It's a thousand. Okay. That's way too much.
[15541.26s -> 15566.06s]  Decorations. You're going to think for five dollars. I guess not. A wheelbarrow. All right.
[15566.14s -> 15595.80s]  Whatever. Let's go. Out of my way. All right. So now it's straight, right? No. Where am I going?
[15595.80s -> 15623.05s]  This way? Oh, rear end that guy. I got the map now. I got it. I have no idea what he's doing,
[15623.05s -> 15633.51s]  but I can't look away. I have all my shit here still, right? Yeah. Okay. We're good.
[15633.51s -> 15651.16s]  And then at night tonight, I'm going to go take my car. Fucking be an idiot. Turn the radio on.
[15656.46s -> 15717.34s]  There's nothing on radio. It's DMCA. This is one log in the road. All right. Let's go. Repair kit.
[15717.82s -> 15724.26s]  Repair kit again. This is starting to look like a nice car now. All right. What should I do it to?
[15724.26s -> 15754.22s]  One of the tires? Yeah. I'm going to do to one of the tires. Hell yeah. Where's my nice. Very cool.
[15754.22s -> 15768.92s]  All right. Hell yeah. Now I want the spoiler. Look at that. It's looking good. Looking much better.
[15768.92s -> 15806.73s]  Are you serious? Can I not paint the spoiler? How do I use this under glow kit? How do I use it?
[15806.73s -> 15831.54s]  How do I put that on? Put it under the hood. This is a remover, right? Crouching and lift up the car.
[15831.54s -> 15850.78s]  I don't have, how do I, I don't have a jack. I don't like have a jack, right? I mean, I can't
[15850.78s -> 15864.62s]  really. Where's my, where is it? If I have it, where is it? Is it for the interior? Oh, yep. It is.
[15864.62s -> 15907.66s]  Okay. It's for the interior. Whoa. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It's, it's a fucking stick of Ram. Okay. All
[15907.66s -> 15912.28s]  right. All right. All right. All right. We're ready. I'm ready to, I think I'm ready to race
[15912.28s -> 15927.32s]  this thing tonight, right? Good friendship with Francis. Complete the garage. Gain access to the
[15927.32s -> 15939.90s]  scrap yard. Install a manual transmission. I'm not doing that. Okay. So let's go race. How do I,
[15939.90s -> 15950.50s]  I get it. I can take this off. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. What happened? That ear was itchy. I'm so
[15950.50s -> 15966.81s]  sorry. This thing's ready to rock and roll. What time is it? It's okay. Let me, um, I have energy.
[15966.81s -> 15977.35s]  Let me check it out. Why does the spoiler keep falling off? Do I have to screw it on? Oh, green
[15977.35s -> 15992.92s]  tint. That's right. Holy shit. You're right. How could I forget? Wait, am I gonna, am I gonna be
[15993.00s -> 16024.47s]  supposed to put it on? The tires are deflated. No, they're not night vision. Oh yeah. The tires
[16024.47s -> 16035.08s]  are not deflated. They're fine. What the fuck happened? This tire, something wrong with this
[16035.08s -> 16072.62s]  tire. Dude, what the fuck? How do I keep it on there to tape it? This is my wrench. I don't,
[16072.62s -> 16086.31s]  I have no idea what the wrench is. So whatever. All right. It's time. It is almost six o'clock.
[16086.31s -> 16101.75s]  Almost make sure I have gas to do this shit. I want a full tank of gas. I can finally drive
[16101.75s -> 16123.24s]  this thing. I don't want to use the whole thing because I need this over here. Someone here,
[16132.31s -> 16153.69s]  someone here. All right. Save your game. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[16153.69s -> 16161.80s]  Save it and then it'll be really late at night and I can go do the race. How old are you?
[16163.24s -> 16195.64s]  I turned 19 a week ago. I was graduation. Are you 19 in dog years?
[16199.26s -> 16213.37s]  You look younger than ever. Moisturize. If anybody asked me for any actual advice,
[16213.37s -> 16220.10s]  the advice is actually moisturize your face. That's the only, that's the advice I'm going
[16220.10s -> 16261.74s]  to give you for anything. Wait, I can boost the seat up? How do I turn the fucking lights on?
[16273.26s -> 16305.93s]  Oh, look at this car. I need the radio. This car doesn't have a radio. What do you mean?
[16305.93s -> 16317.93s]  Doesn't have no way. There's no radio. All right. Into town and I'm going to do,
[16318.65s -> 16351.64s]  I don't know where I'm going, but I'm going somewhere in town. What? The spoiler came off.
[16351.64s -> 16381.82s]  It is. It's so dark. It's so dark. I can't see anything. Did I go the wrong way? I feel like
[16381.82s -> 16404.23s]  I went the wrong way. No, I didn't. It's right here. Can you play this game in third person
[16404.23s -> 16421.59s]  does it have to be a first person? Oh shit. Okay. I got it. Hey yo, what's up? What's up?
[16421.59s -> 16449.03s]  What's up, fellas? All right. All right. What do you think? What's up, dude? What's up, bro?
[16449.03s -> 16452.31s]  Yo man, even though it's kind of cold tonight, it's nothing compared to how I stoned I am.
[16452.31s -> 16460.46s]  You have some for that. You have some for that. You have some for sell. Don't bring him in that.
[16462.44s -> 16471.27s]  I would probably wait. I would like to race. Good to see you. So boring racing here in almost straight
[16471.27s -> 16483.29s]  line. I like tore up the road. You look good today. My twin cam engine is so fast. Imagine
[16483.29s -> 16494.15s]  when I turned it more. How's everything? You look good today. Thank you. Pretty cool. Are we ready
[16494.15s -> 16506.78s]  to go race to the sawmill? I don't know where any of this stuff is. I don't, I don't have $50.
[16530.63s -> 16538.86s]  I'll see you in two days, man. By the way, call the fucking Kellogg's box. You got that
[16538.86s -> 16575.98s]  fucking piece of shit out of good one. Easy run. It's just going to chase me. Oh shit. I need to
[16575.98s -> 16596.79s]  eat something. Where am I? What's the point of that if I'm just wasting gas? There's no point.
[16596.79s -> 16610.07s]  I just literally used a half a tank of gas for no reason. I need $50. So you know what we're doing.
[16612.86s -> 16625.40s]  Wood cutting stream. How is it? I need to go to sleep. Burn this off. I don't want to waste the
[16625.40s -> 16647.48s]  gas. This dude's going to end up at level 99 wood cutting. You got to sell weed. Go climb the
[16647.48s -> 16653.10s]  wind turbines and you'll get weed seeds. I might buy potatoes over here too. I need to check on
[16653.10s -> 16669.08s]  them. How are they doing? Getting there. 88%. Probably tomorrow. All right. Here we go. I'm
[16669.08s -> 16673.32s]  taking my truck down here and I'm going to fill it. I'm going to try to get like five or six hundred
[16673.32s -> 16698.25s]  bucks. Chainsaw's in there. Let's get this stuff out. Everything's empty. Good. Chainsaw in there.
[16698.89s -> 16710.47s]  Okay. Time to cut some wood. Everybody's favorite part of the stream. Weed is a crop that's been
[16710.47s -> 16720.90s]  grown and harvested. You don't need to copy and paste the entire paragraph to get me to
[16720.90s -> 16741.86s]  do the weed thing. Let's move. Okay. Fill the car. Wood right here should be fine.
[16742.74s -> 16749.45s]  Parking brake. I'm going to keep the lights on because I think it illuminates the area a little
[16749.45s -> 16765.96s]  bit if I had it the right fucking way. Great. Good job. Good work. We want weed. I'll do it.
[16765.96s -> 16784.98s]  I'll do it tomorrow. Let me at least get some cash so I can keep playing. You can find weed at the
[16784.98s -> 16789.91s]  top of one of the windmills. That seems like so out of the way. Why would they? That seems like
[16789.91s -> 16831.45s]  really far away. Let's do two more trees. Chainsaw. Okay. Dude, what am I thinking? Am I like stupid?
[16831.45s -> 16845.29s]  Look at this. I can just put this shit in the car like this. It should stay in there, right?
[16845.29s -> 16869.40s]  I'm looking for at least a thousand bucks. This is enough. This will get me to at least 500.
[16870.12s -> 16943.43s]  That's fine. It's all right. I'm not going far. Quickly and efficiently. I'll grow weed. I promise
[16943.43s -> 16958.65s]  I'll grow weed. His cheeks are the same color as his shirt. It's because my white balance is fucked
[16958.65s -> 16978.06s]  up. That means I have a lot of like blood in my face which is like, you know, healthy. They call
[16978.06s -> 16995.50s]  it a glow, guys. Come on. That's all I got for now. Is there a... It's probably a better way to load
[16995.50s -> 17012.30s]  the truck, right? Whatever. A healthy 70% total blood level in your cheeks. I don't know what's
[17012.70s -> 17020.17s]  supposed to be healthy or whatever, but I feel okay. I feel fine. What time is it? It's not too
[17020.17s -> 17034.10s]  late. I can keep going. I actually probably can put another couple of trees in here. We'll see.
[17045.11s -> 17057.42s]  Maybe not. I'm getting hung. I'm getting... What did you just say? Do you sleep like a bat? Is that
[17057.42s -> 17070.17s]  why? I don't know how they do that. How do bats do that shit? It isn't hanging upside down. How
[17070.17s -> 17079.98s]  do they sleep upside down? Wouldn't that be just bad? How does a bat sleep upside down and have it
[17079.98s -> 17095.64s]  be like, okay? They evolved to do that. But what, like, mechanically, how is that functioning?
[17101.58s -> 17111.93s]  I can definitely put more than another tree in here. Probably two more. Oh my god, fine.
[17124.34s -> 17142.65s]  Okay, I'm good. I'll go get the weed. I will. Wait. These are done. 88%. These have been
[17142.65s -> 17149.66s]  done tomorrow. Probably have a different... I feel like if I read that, that's me saying something
[17149.66s -> 17156.71s]  weird. Different system in the brain? I feel like that's like a ligma, like ligma nuts or something,
[17156.71s -> 17169.14s]  right? What are you saying? Everybody wants to say that so I don't look like an idiot.
[17169.14s -> 17175.74s]  The limbic system. Yeah, but I don't know. I just was reading it for a second. I'm just like, wait,
[17175.74s -> 17195.29s]  is that like a ligma, like ligma balls? I don't know. You said it though. If I was just saying,
[17195.29s -> 17201.32s]  is it one of those? Because, I don't know, I can't trust any of you. I can't trust you guys.
[17201.32s -> 17216.52s]  Sometimes it's, you guys go... I don't know. Vinny just hosted. What's going on guys? Thanks Vinny.
[17217.74s -> 17224.04s]  Welcome, welcome, welcome. We are in the process of cutting wood and we are creating
[17225.38s -> 17234.42s]  an environment where I can make some money in this game. Hope you had a good stream. Thanks a lot.
[17235.06s -> 17239.51s]  Stick around, we're gonna be here for a little while. You caught us at a great time because
[17239.51s -> 17247.58s]  we're about to make about five to six hundred dollars here and then I'm gonna go do a street
[17247.58s -> 17256.30s]  race. So we are, it's gonna be Pog. I'm afraid that there's not enough gas to cut all this but
[17256.30s -> 17280.84s]  let's find out. Welcome to the cutting wood for five hours stream. I've done other stuff
[17280.84s -> 17285.72s]  like get lost and complain about the map for a long time. I mean that was a while.
[17285.72s -> 17303.51s]  Are we doing one more? One more batch? All right, that's it. Enough, enough, enough, enough. No more.
[17303.51s -> 17314.62s]  Take this, sell it. Go to the windmill, get the weed. From there we'll go from at the weed.
[17314.62s -> 17330.46s]  Potatoes will be done by then. I feel like I'm making a Thanksgiving dinner. What was Vinny doing
[17330.46s -> 17341.06s]  today? Anything interesting? Something cool? Waiting, one more. What's, ah come on, what's one more?
[17341.06s -> 17353.88s]  Kirby? Is that new Kirby game any good? Is it the new Kirby game? Should I play the new Kirby game?
[17353.88s -> 17378.39s]  I wish this was strawberry magic. Yeah, it's good. Interesting. Lego Star Wars 2? Yeah, there's a lot
[17378.39s -> 17386.52s]  of things I could play. What should I do next time? You want to do like a full-on viewer's choice
[17386.52s -> 17390.28s]  right now? There's like 20,000 people here. Are you ready to have, you want to go for it?
[17390.28s -> 17410.76s]  What do you guys want to do? I'm open to suggestions. All right, that's it. No more. Do M&M's Beach Party?
[17410.76s -> 17423.98s]  Ah, I played that game. It was all right. Elden Ring Part 35. Did you do Breath of the Wild?
[17430.26s -> 17444.90s]  Not now, not yet. I need to be really in the mood for that. Ace Attorney? I can't play Ace Attorney.
[17444.90s -> 17449.83s]  We, all right, let me go over this real quick for a lot of the new viewers that don't know.
[17449.83s -> 17454.97s]  I would, I want to play Ace Attorney. I want to play it. But Ace Attorney does this thing
[17454.97s -> 17465.37s]  where every minute to like two minutes, the screen goes and it's a white flash in your face.
[17467.22s -> 17477.40s]  It actually happens like every 15 to 30 seconds. It goes. I wish I could turn it off.
[17481.66s -> 17492.26s]  The next time you play Ace Attorney, just watch. It flashes the screen every 15 seconds. This is
[17492.26s -> 17504.15s]  a lot of wood. We're good. All right, let's go turn this in. If I could mod it out as an option to turn
[17504.15s -> 17507.99s]  the flash off in the newest Ace Attorney game. Yeah, the newest one, but not the old ones. Then
[17507.99s -> 17514.54s]  everyone wants to see the old ones played on this stream, right? I get requests all the time to play
[17514.54s -> 17547.10s]  Ace Attorney. Oh! I'm fine. We're good. Didn't lose one brick. Do the remade one? Switch version.
[17547.10s -> 17565.88s]  You can turn it off. Huh. Wear shades. Just wear sunglasses while I play. That would be so stupid,
[17565.88s -> 17586.20s]  but it would work. All right. Who's going to be the closest? How much am I going to get for this?
[17586.20s -> 17599.27s]  Or like 50 or 25. All right. I'm ready to fucking race. Can I do it? It says become friends with
[17599.27s -> 17606.17s]  Francis. Can I say anything to him or do anything with him? Can we hang out? I don't. We just
[17606.17s -> 17617.46s]  completed the second floor in the garage. So much room for activities. Okay, cool. I don't think I
[17617.46s -> 17626.36s]  can go in there, but sure. Okay. $125. I have gas. I'm going to go bet and I'm going to go race and
[17626.36s -> 17630.28s]  I'm going to go sleep and I'm going to come back. I'm going to race. Sounds fun. Let's do it.
[17631.00s -> 17683.86s]  This is wasting gas. Is it? It takes more gas to back up. Oh, my spoiler's back. That's actually
[17683.86s -> 17691.06s]  cool. Didn't I lose it? Oh, I've reloaded the game. That's right. So that means I have to do the
[17691.06s -> 17700.09s]  tires again then. This one especially. No. Maybe I did. Did I save it after doing that? Yeah, I did.
[17700.09s -> 17716.65s]  Okay. All right. I'm ready to do it. Let's go. Rest up. I'll save the game when I get up.
[17716.65s -> 17734.92s]  Bolt the spoiler down. How do I bolt the spoiler down? Do I have a thing to do that?
[17734.92s -> 17753.69s]  It doesn't look like there's a slot for it. Is there a slot for this? I don't see one. I need
[17753.69s -> 17775.45s]  the wrench. Okay. What do I do with the wrench? Where's the wrench? Dude, where's the wrench?
[17775.45s -> 17826.25s]  Thank you. Is it on there now? Do I need two? I'm ready. Turning this on. Save the game and
[17826.25s -> 17851.83s]  let's go race. Very cool. Almost time. Night night night, right? Night time. Stanley Parable Ultra
[17851.83s -> 17874.62s]  Deluxe. It'll be night time when I'm done with this. Don't yawn. We didn't decide what game.
[17876.65s -> 17881.46s]  I don't know. I'm down for whatever. What's something that I haven't done that you guys
[17881.46s -> 17910.22s]  would like to see? Do Ape Escape? How about Paper Mario? No. I've heard of that game,
[17910.22s -> 17918.58s]  Iron Lung. Should we do Iron Lung? That game's only like an hour and a half long though, right?
[17920.81s -> 17925.56s]  We'd have to do something else. All right. Well, next stream, we're going to do Iron Lung.
[17927.35s -> 17944.62s]  And no, I'm not stopping the stream right now. I have to win. I have to do at least race one time.
[17944.62s -> 17965.10s]  I've got plenty of gas, right? I can't find the lights every time. They're in such a weird
[17965.10s -> 18004.20s]  spot. Where are they? Right here. All right. Both? Okay. Yeah. Yes. Let's do it. B for third
[18004.20s -> 18024.79s]  person. Holy shit. I cannot fucking believe it's taking me five hours to press B. Oh, I don't know.
[18024.79s -> 18073.88s]  How am I supposed to know? This is so much better. You should do a drift. Medium left. Just play
[18073.88s -> 18081.75s]  Baldi's Basics. No. I'll do Iron Lung and something else. We need like two or three games next time.
[18081.75s -> 18100.86s]  I have a list of stuff that I haven't played yet. That might be fun. I could jump out of the car.
[18100.86s -> 18114.28s]  All right. I'm back. Race to the sawmill. I don't know what the sawmill is and I don't know where
[18114.28s -> 18180.44s]  it is. So let's go. Go beside. All right. Let's go. Here we go. I'm ready. What? That's it? That's it?
[18180.44s -> 18196.12s]  How am I ever going to beat anybody? How am I supposed to do this? I need to cheat. All right.
[18196.12s -> 18202.50s]  Does somebody else have a car that I can beat? I feel like the truck is faster. The truck is
[18202.50s -> 18207.77s]  probably faster. I feel like it actually is faster. I don't know why I'm using this thing.
[18207.77s -> 18224.49s]  Let's go again. Okay. Race to the... Okay. Race to the Federation. This is just $200. All right.
[18224.49s -> 18263.54s]  This car didn't look as fast. How do you reverse? I don't know. Oh, come on. Jesus Christ. Actually,
[18263.54s -> 18290.46s]  like actually stuck. Where is everybody? Did that motherfucker take $200 from me and leave?
[18290.46s -> 18304.22s]  Because it's morning or something? What the fuck is going on? What? I drove off? I didn't drive off.
[18304.22s -> 18309.50s]  I was trying to turn around and then everybody leaves? Like the geek in the fucking wooden
[18309.50s -> 18319.91s]  spoiler car? You take my money and leave? All right. I'm going to the windmills. We're doing
[18319.91s -> 18351.18s]  the weed. Fine. Reload the save. Yeah. Sure. I'll give you $200 and I'll race you. Okay. Good.
[18351.18s -> 18356.46s]  Thanks, man. Okay. Let me just like turn around real quick. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. This
[18356.46s -> 18363.30s]  is a new car. I don't know how to reverse it. Don't leave. Why is everybody leaving? Don't leave.
[18363.30s -> 18385.42s]  This motherfucker tinted his windshield. We got to go. We got to get the fuck out of here.
[18385.42s -> 18406.38s]  Cartoon geek. Oh, you can use your blinkers. How do I turn my blinker off? I don't know.
[18406.38s -> 18429.59s]  Where is it? How do I turn the blinker off? All right. One, I want to let me do the $200 one.
[18429.59s -> 18440.12s]  That's it. I feel like that's going to be longer and there's more opportunity for them to make
[18440.12s -> 18461.90s]  mistake. Well, I take the more expensive track because I feel like the more expensive one is
[18461.90s -> 18470.14s]  longer. So I probably have a chance to take a turn or something. It's probably harder,
[18470.14s -> 18473.18s]  but if there are turns involved, then I might actually be able to get an advantage.
[18480.06s -> 18485.02s]  Whatever happens here, no matter what, I'm going to get over to the windmill
[18486.14s -> 18497.08s]  and climb the wind. Let's just do it now. No, I will go to the windmill and see if I can get up
[18497.08s -> 18526.14s]  there and get the weed. Oh shit. It's the fucking green geek again. It's the fucking green geek.
[18526.14s -> 18596.54s]  Don't do that. God damn it. Come on. God. Okay. We're good. It doesn't count. It doesn't count
[18596.54s -> 18604.36s]  because you have to touch it. Oh my God. He's blazing. I'm in the fucking dust. This is late
[18604.36s -> 18612.90s]  game shit. How am I ever going to do this? Look at this. Look at how much loser my grandma does
[18612.90s -> 18653.64s]  her shopping faster than that. No, it's in the ocean. This geek didn't, he didn't belong.
[18653.64s -> 18681.86s]  Oh shit. The car's smoking. I got to get out. What the fuck? All right. I obviously can't do that. So
[18682.74s -> 18686.98s]  my car is way too shitty. So I'm just going to go get the marijuana.
[18713.18s -> 18763.00s]  I don't even fucking care if the hood's up. Let's go. We're going to get the marijuana.
[18763.00s -> 18771.18s]  Some fucking geek comes over to the street race in like a fucking, in like a 2000 fucking,
[18771.18s -> 18782.73s]  like 13 camera or something puts lights on it, has a wooden spoiler, goes 70 miles per hour
[18782.73s -> 18798.95s]  and misses the first turn and goes into the ocean. All right. So you're telling me I climb up one of
[18798.95s -> 18804.55s]  these things and there's marijuana on top of one of the windmills. This feels like horse shit,
[18804.55s -> 18810.31s]  by the way. This feels like absolute horse shit. Like you made this up.
[18811.48s -> 18845.96s]  How am I going to climb the windmill? You made it up. You made it up. It's on the game's Wiki.
[18845.96s -> 18870.54s]  Oh shit. You didn't make it up. You've accused Chad of lying like five times now.
[18872.17s -> 18894.60s]  I would have bet, I would have bet $10,000 that that wasn't a log cutter. Cannabis seeds. Oh yeah.
[18901.05s -> 18916.41s]  Did they fall damage? I got weed seeds now. Who cares if I don't know how to drive?
[18916.41s -> 18952.36s]  I can just sell weed. All right. Get me out of here. Back to the road, which is over here,
[18952.36s -> 18966.73s]  right? The road over here. Okay. How do I go? How do I get out of here? I gotta get back into the
[18966.73s -> 18977.43s]  main road. Where's the main road? Am I on the road right now? I think I have to turn around.
[18977.43s -> 18996.84s]  It's so dark. I don't know where I am. Okay. This is it right here. Right. Am I going the right way?
[18996.84s -> 19025.56s]  I can't fucking read this map. It's too dark. I think it's this way, right? Right. That's right.
[19025.56s -> 19063.05s]  Right. I think this is, this is, this is, this is, this is, I don't know where I am. Windmills are
[19063.13s -> 19091.40s]  down here. Um, I actually don't know. I think this is correct. Am I just going in a circle?
[19093.51s -> 19097.35s]  I might just actually be going in a circle. Nope. Okay. I have, this is the garage,
[19099.59s -> 19110.04s]  which was, uh, I think I'm up. Okay. I just keep on this road.
[19125.75s -> 19130.70s]  This should take me all the way around, right? I can't read the scrap. Uh, yark. I don't know.
[19130.70s -> 19138.97s]  I can't get in. Yeah. Okay. I remember this. This is the next road to go this way. You can go down
[19138.97s -> 19147.90s]  here, which should take me, wrap me around past the windmills again, which will put me down at
[19147.90s -> 19162.55s]  the bottom part of that map. Think, right? Your car's on fire. It's not, it's just a little smoky.
[19162.55s -> 19177.98s]  Okay. Now I'm going the right way. Is the windmills are right next to me?
[19177.98s -> 19185.08s]  Like I go down and then I take a right. I think. No idea. Actually, I think it's,
[19185.08s -> 19187.48s]  I think it's the next time I can take a right, I can take a right.
[19187.48s -> 19202.84s]  Remember, it's your father. We need to change your oil. I think that's correct.
[19202.84s -> 19219.50s]  Think. Uh, you gotta change your oil every 3000 miles. This is, I just went in a circle.
[19219.50s -> 19228.89s]  I just wish I knew what direction I was even facing. The three windmills are over there on
[19228.89s -> 19234.28s]  the right. So I need to turn around and go that way and then take a right on that road.
[19240.31s -> 19253.05s]  I think we lost. Block the enemy race car with your truck or something.
[19253.05s -> 19256.89s]  Hold on. I need to get back to my house first. This is way more important.
[19256.89s -> 19268.70s]  I just went in a circle again. Go this way back this way. And then I take a right
[19274.57s -> 19279.46s]  this dirt road. All right. Thank God it's becoming daytime.
[19279.46s -> 19283.43s]  I can actually see what I'm doing. Here we go. All right. Let's go get out.
[19288.60s -> 19308.41s]  Okay. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. I feel like I'm in a world of Warcraft
[19308.41s -> 19312.33s]  zone and I'm like, I hacked the game and I modded it and I'm in a car. I've done,
[19312.33s -> 19327.90s]  I feel like I'm not supposed to be driving a car here. I don't know where I'm going.
[19335.19s -> 19352.26s]  Oh my fucking God. I'm back at this. Please God help me. What do I keep doing wrong?
[19352.26s -> 19359.06s]  What do I keep doing? Just go back. Is the thing on the right,
[19359.70s -> 19364.17s]  that French word in the top right, is the thing on the top right,
[19364.17s -> 19370.60s]  is am I at a Wille Donk Jacks right now? Is that where I am? Is that where I am?
[19372.63s -> 19383.10s]  So if I turn around and just stay on this fucking road, then why does this thing say like
[19383.10s -> 19390.62s]  Jim's Automotive? What happened? A rock just hit me. All right. Slow down. I'm going to fucking
[19390.62s -> 19413.21s]  relax. So now if I just stay on this road and just stay left and then stay left again and just go
[19413.21s -> 19429.50s]  around, I don't fucking know, man, whatever. So just stay left, stay left both times that way.
[19429.50s -> 19443.59s]  Can I just get on the Griffin and fucking get out of here? 15 K people are watching you lost
[19443.59s -> 19463.85s]  in Westfall. I'm telling you, man, it's confusing. Not here. Okay. Take a left. Okay. Left. Stay left
[19463.85s -> 19467.45s]  and then stay left again. If I turn around another circle, I'm going to eat the monitor. I'm going to
[19467.45s -> 19480.42s]  just eat it one by one. I'm going to break the monitor over my knee and eat it. I'm so, my
[19480.42s -> 19497.78s]  character is so tired. Okay. Stay left again. And that should be, and then just go, I think, right?
[19497.78s -> 19540.82s]  Yeah. I got it. And then my house should be on my right. Please. Please. We're so close to Disneyland.
[19556.94s -> 19564.28s]  I tell you, I don't know where it is, honey. We already went down that road. That says Epcot.
[19564.36s -> 19570.28s]  Maybe if this place wasn't as big as fucking like four cities in Texas, we'd be able to figure out
[19570.28s -> 19575.38s]  where we were going. I don't know what the fuck happened. I swear to fucking God, man, I'm about
[19575.38s -> 19580.63s]  to just walk home and just use the truck and fuck this thing. Chop this thing up and throw it in the
[19580.63s -> 19629.16s]  trash. Who cares? I'm not a truck. Okay. I'm going the right way now, right? And just stay through
[19629.16s -> 19653.21s]  here. This is correct. No. Give me a goddamn blip on the map. Like honest to God. Just give me a
[19653.21s -> 19657.85s]  blip. Like there's so many weird twisty turns. Give me a blip on the map. Even if it, okay.
[19657.85s -> 19662.97s]  Even if it was like, this was your last known location 30 seconds ago, it would be better.
[19662.97s -> 19674.79s]  I would at least be able to know where the fuck I was going. Where am I now? The weed seeds are
[19674.79s -> 19678.23s]  fine. They're right there. All right. Now, now we're okay. Now I'm just straight here. Straight.
[19685.24s -> 19703.67s]  Straight again. Right? Yes. I'm about to drive into the fucking ocean. Buy a GPS.
[19704.31s -> 19721.46s]  The seeds are fine. They haven't moved. I promise. Go back. This is the wrong way.
[19721.46s -> 19734.38s]  Oh, it's the wrong way. Is it? Get me the fuck out of here. Oh, dad. Um, isn't it like already four
[19734.38s -> 19742.31s]  o'clock? It is. Yes, it is. Doesn't do. I think we missed the Donald Duck breakfast. It's all right.
[19742.31s -> 19751.11s]  It's okay. We're fine. We can't, son, son. Oh, son. Dad. Dad. Son, I'm coming.
[19753.43s -> 19771.43s]  Son. Get me out of the car now before I freak out. Give me these. It's all I care about. I don't care
[19771.43s -> 19777.51s]  if that thing fucking explodes. I don't care if this car explodes. I don't fucking care. Explode
[19777.51s -> 19782.07s]  for all I care. All I, I don't, the truck is way better. Why would you not have a truck? Let's go
[19782.07s -> 19787.51s]  over what trucks have. Versatility, four-wheel drive, space, speed. Don't overdrive a little
[19787.51s -> 19791.51s]  shit sedan like that. Why would you overdrive a sedan like that? The truck is 5,000 times better.
[19791.51s -> 19795.38s]  I wish I could put a better engine in this fucking bad boy. You know what I'm saying?
[19795.38s -> 19839.70s]  Where's the weed? I need to dig. We missed the Donald Duck breakfast. I have two seeds, right?
[19839.70s -> 19854.06s]  You need a harvest basket? Fuck off. I don't need a harvest basket. It's called use your hands like
[19854.06s -> 19867.83s]  a man and just rip them up. Dad, why are you planting seeds in the ground in our hotel?
[19868.79s -> 19877.26s]  Son, it's everything to be fine. Dad, the only thing we rode was it's a small world and that ride
[19877.26s -> 19883.61s]  sucks. That's right. I like that ride actually. I rode that three times in a row because nobody
[19883.61s -> 19890.87s]  fast passes that piece of shit. We can ride that as many times as you want, son. But I wanted to
[19890.87s -> 19897.21s]  ride Space Mountain. Space Mountain sucks. It's, you can't even see it. It's just dark. Who cares?
[19897.85s -> 19901.45s]  You don't even know you're on a roller coaster, son. Trust me, it's a small world. It's just
[19901.45s -> 19916.86s]  paying for your buck. Dad, don't you understand that it's going to take like four weeks for the
[19916.86s -> 19926.47s]  marijuana to grow? Son, I got fertilizer. It'll happen much faster. Are we planning on being
[19926.47s -> 19932.55s]  at Disney World for four weeks? I have to go to school. You don't have to go to school.
[19935.35s -> 19963.51s]  I'm not huffing that. He was spray painting the wall. Put it away. Put it away and get on with it.
[19963.51s -> 19976.81s]  Turn the car off. Water the plants and I'm going to sleep for a week and I'm just going to eat
[19976.81s -> 19981.29s]  food and sleep for a week and then I'm going to go back to that meet and greet at where all the
[19981.29s -> 19986.73s]  cars are and I'm going to sell weed to everybody and then it doesn't matter if I drive my car into
[19986.73s -> 19991.77s]  the ocean. It doesn't matter because I'm the guy that sells the weed. Precisely what we talked
[19991.77s -> 19996.01s]  about in the first like three hours of the stream. I'm not the guy that cuts the wood. I'm the guy
[19996.01s -> 20005.27s]  that I don't I'm not the guy that sells the weed. I don't do that. I'm just saying that like I don't
[20005.27s -> 20011.74s]  need to that was came out weird that came out very wrong. My point is it's like I don't have to drive
[20011.74s -> 20034.10s]  the car. I can do another activity and it's fine. Where did it go? Breaking bad. Marijuana is not
[20034.90s -> 20037.78s]  oh yeah I got marijuana in my possession.
[20041.86s -> 20043.78s]  He's got weed in his glove box.
[20047.32s -> 20054.74s]  Please it's just illegal in fucking all every county in America almost.
[20054.74s -> 20077.93s]  Dad why are you doing that? Why? Put it back. Breaking bad. I've got like a gram of marijuana
[20077.93s -> 20086.94s]  in my possession. Oh breaking bad. All right how does it look? How many days to take? How do I
[20086.94s -> 20092.66s]  harvest this? A harvesting basket. So let me go get a harvest. I'm gonna sleep 10 days in a row.
[20093.22s -> 20098.10s]  Harvesting basket. Would you get it from the store? Which just I'm gonna go to sleep again.
[20098.10s -> 20115.00s]  Who cares? Chill. You just slept. No. Go to bed now. Dad why do you keep humming that song?
[20119.58s -> 20132.63s]  Why are you doing air guitar? It's just marijuana. I can't sleep. So what am I supposed to do?
[20133.27s -> 20154.41s]  I guess I got wood. Car is still running. Why is this fucking seat? Dude okay
[20155.05s -> 20174.06s]  relax. Why is it so far up? Car is off. The lights are just on. Okay all right I'm going to use the
[20174.06s -> 20189.18s]  ATV. Should I? Is there gas in here? I haven't drove this yet. This sounds like fun. How do you
[20189.18s -> 20208.70s]  where's the ignition on an ATV? Does it even have one? Where is it in the middle? How do I think it
[20208.70s -> 20234.76s]  turns on? I mean I thought this thing here. How do I drive it? Parking brake. It obviously has gas.
[20235.40s -> 20270.17s]  Put it in gear? How do you put it in? I've never driven one of these before. R and F? That was fun.
[20282.33s -> 20305.86s]  All right go back to sleep. All right is R and F on the car too? I'm just so awake. Do I have
[20305.86s -> 20336.36s]  enough to turn it on and save? Oh shit. I'm out of gas too. Fuck me. Really? I'm just going into town
[20336.36s -> 20368.39s]  and waiting till it opens. Excuse me? Wait I already have a harvesting basket? Are you kidding

[20505.08s -> 20512.22s]  blink my eyes without having it like mess with the lights. Have it be like transparent or something.

[21797.35s -> 21812.39s]  that does um and then the stream is ending that's the last thing I'm gonna do everything is so
[21812.39s -> 21845.70s]  bright 25 probably car running no it's fine we said do george saying a little bit of spi
[21849.96s -> 21869.10s]  no that's too that's dumb a little bit of spi jerry a bit of spi you know it's kind of sad that
[21869.10s -> 21876.10s]  Seinfeld I kind of wish that they was like Seinfeld existed now imagine like the george is
[21876.10s -> 21885.30s]  a streamer episode he would accidentally walk in like naked or something right they get banned it
[21885.30s -> 21894.44s]  would be about how how george got like a like a 30-day twitch ban you didn't turn off the stream
[21894.44s -> 21902.55s]  you didn't hit this end stream button I thought I did I stuff and the kramer comes in yeah I stream
[21902.55s -> 21910.63s]  too another website it's called like chatterbait or something right he's like doing porn and and
[21910.63s -> 21934.90s]  kramer thinks that george is also doing like chatterbait that's too specific oh but go back
[21934.90s -> 21950.79s]  to bed I want those things just to grow by chatterbait I don't know it'd be like if I
[21951.51s -> 21964.82s]  kramer has like been doing that I guess for a long time and okay and george is talking about
[21964.82s -> 21969.86s]  streaming on twitch but kramer's talking about streaming on like chatterbait so but they don't
[21970.42s -> 21977.22s]  you know what I mean like they don't understand that they're different places until the very end
[21977.22s -> 21983.24s]  where kramer is like oh I'm gonna go live on george's computer and he's like taking his clothes
[21983.24s -> 21988.46s]  off and he's on twitch and that's when it's like the ding ding ding ding that's where it stops
[21988.46s -> 22021.16s]  and to get the ending 34 we're almost there this is just outside what am I doing you look very
[22021.16s -> 22045.70s]  handsome today thanks newman is a vtuber and and the whole time like jerry doesn't get it jerry
[22045.70s -> 22056.18s]  doesn't understand like he he doesn't get what how it works or why it works he sees like newman
[22056.18s -> 22065.88s]  walking down the street with like a wad of hundreds hello jerry newman oh you're probably
[22065.96s -> 22076.38s]  wondering where I got all the money not really and then jerry incorporates that into a stand-up
[22076.38s -> 22106.14s]  it'd be oh it'd be great episode what's the deal with vtubers what are they at I'm telling
[22106.14s -> 22113.35s]  you I'm just like sleeping and eating until this is done 36 god damn it I still have so much more
[22115.32s -> 22129.10s]  keep the episode going I don't know just it's a thought which is a fun thought and then george's
[22129.10s -> 22137.32s]  dad like wants to get into it too who's that George I'm gonna do this vtuber thing I'm gonna
[22146.87s -> 22150.63s]  where are we going how's life what no I don't want to go to school where am I going
[22156.26s -> 22162.02s]  I heard new I heard newman did it for a million bucks he's a millionaire jerry he's a millionaire
[22162.02s -> 22180.65s]  george a million bucks I don't I have no idea where I'm going no no don't actually don't stop
[22180.65s -> 22214.62s]  I'm gonna all right Ernie Sanders oh to get the truck holy shit that's awesome everyone's doing
[22214.62s -> 22218.30s]  this thing with a weird thing where they find everything you say funny and is omega lulling
[22218.30s -> 22239.74s]  everything you say they're so nice oh we're going up omega lol true they are kind of nice
[22239.74s -> 22276.63s]  it is pretty fun we want him to feel good about himself so we do that I would love a Seinfeld in
[22276.63s -> 22291.02s]  current times I guess that's kind of Larry David that's Kirby enthusiasm right now right he hasn't
[22291.02s -> 22298.18s]  been actually funny since the sorcery streams you're seeing the first streams that I really
[22298.18s -> 22302.98s]  kind of really went in hard on on twitch seven years ago were the only things I ever did that
[22302.98s -> 22316.66s]  you liked interesting where's the truck can you go a little bit further a little bit further up
[22316.66s -> 22340.50s]  here it's my stop you're all nasty stop it all right get up get up get up how do I get up thank
[22340.50s -> 22359.16s]  you I've been watching you for 10 years that's that's ridiculous I can't believe I've been doing
[22359.16s -> 22366.14s]  this for that long you know sometimes like you just think in my brain like three or four years ago
[22366.14s -> 22379.26s]  it was like it was it was like 10 years ago it's weird it's ridiculous I did not expect it to be
[22379.26s -> 22394.71s]  going this fast because it's carbon on the whole time no god I do it every time it three years ago
[22394.71s -> 22404.39s]  feels like 10 years ago the other way around right yes I meant to say the other way around
[22404.39s -> 22421.40s]  all right let's go back home that should be enough time for the weed to grow I need to go
[22421.40s -> 22430.44s]  that way it makes me think now I know we've kind of been messing around this whole time just
[22430.44s -> 22442.41s]  fucking around but real talk if 10 years went by that fast another 10 years is that's kind of
[22442.41s -> 22452.20s]  ridiculous that's insane to think about that like 10 years from now I hope it doesn't go that fast
[22452.92s -> 22506.86s]  are you gonna stream in your 40s I'm not even 40 yet relax he's gonna do something even cooler
[22506.86s -> 22514.66s]  you know here's the wild thing oh eventually eventually you're gonna stop doing this right
[22514.66s -> 22528.02s]  eventually what when I think of the things that I want to do and there's a lot of things that
[22528.02s -> 22536.90s]  I'd like to do like going forward right uh but it's gonna be hard to match like how I feel about
[22536.90s -> 22542.58s]  this forget about like money forget about anything I'm just talking like to be able to match how I
[22542.58s -> 22551.10s]  feel about this doing this I have other things that I'm equally passionate about right but
[22551.82s -> 22557.56s]  I don't know it's gonna be weird it's gonna be hard but we're not talking about that right now
[22557.56s -> 22563.27s]  because that's not happening right now we're not talking about that right now because that's not
[22563.27s -> 22566.63s]  happening right now everyone relax what we're doing is we're eating poutine and we're making
[22566.63s -> 22577.08s]  we're growing weed in our backyard retirement randy not yet 38 all right let's go some more
[22577.16s -> 22585.98s]  water on there I did not say eating poop see we're eating poop and growing weed in our
[22585.98s -> 22614.33s]  backyards son save the game go to sleep I'm gonna turn this on no no go to sleep then save the game
[22614.33s -> 22648.15s]  that makes more sense to me become a cod streamer no no I don't think so I don't think so you're
[22648.15s -> 22669.69s]  gonna become a family man because maybe I'll become Peter Griffin Peter Griffin in real life
[22669.69s -> 22692.79s]  you're gonna go back to making tf2 tutorials become a game show host that's kind of a good
[22692.79s -> 22700.81s]  gig isn't it right if I if I just like was I hosted real fortune I don't know one's gonna
[22700.81s -> 22720.14s]  give me that job I would watch it if it was you I'd watch the hell out of that what is that for
[22720.14s -> 22734.50s]  almost halfway there we're there come on how can I make time pass very quickly I could cut some more
[22734.50s -> 22749.37s]  wood sleep I can't my energy is full build the sugar shack I don't even know how to do that
[22753.50s -> 22770.44s]  build the sugar shack but I don't buggy pack installed oh buggy part this thing I need more
[22770.44s -> 22792.38s]  buggy parts that's annoying that the muffler is gone that would have been fun oh I know why it's
[22792.38s -> 22801.02s]  so bright because I'm shining the headlights into the house high beams actual high beams into the
[22801.02s -> 22826.23s]  house we were trying to figure that out for so long what time is it were you a teacher or was
[22826.23s -> 22838.70s]  that a bit I was never a teacher I did substitute but any you don't need a teaching degree to
[22838.70s -> 22858.22s]  substitute teach let's go take a stroll with this thing why not why is this dead there's plenty of
[22858.22s -> 22871.53s]  gas in here why is this dead no you don't you don't need a teaching degree you do not need a
[22871.53s -> 22879.56s]  teaching degree to be a substitute unless that has changed in the last 10 to 15 years which maybe
[22879.56s -> 22893.69s]  it has I don't think so oh you still don't know it's probably per state that does not seem right
[22893.69s -> 22902.52s]  to be honest um I mean the issue is if you had to require like a masters in education to sub
[22902.52s -> 22906.82s]  it might be really hard to find a substitute because if you had masters in education
[22907.85s -> 22912.57s]  you'd be a teacher you'd be you'd do like teachers aid and then you become a teacher you wouldn't do
[22912.57s -> 22925.14s]  subbing really maybe you would for a little while different states probably have different criteria
[22928.79s -> 22932.47s]  I'm sure there's plenty of teachers that start doing substitute teaching for a while
[22933.03s -> 22941.45s]  and then you move on to like teachers aid stuff and then again do teaching it would be nice if
[22942.09s -> 22951.16s]  hold on hold on hold on it'd be nice if teachers made way more money
[22951.16s -> 22967.22s]  hold on you know we you know that we pay teachers like such a shit amount of money and the incentive
[22967.22s -> 22974.74s]  to be a teacher is like not that fucking great really and these are the people that are like
[22974.74s -> 22984.79s]  developing our children's brains I don't I don't understand how that makes any sense
[22984.79s -> 22993.45s]  arguably one of the most important jobs in the world and they make fucking nothing why that's
[22993.45s -> 23004.25s]  so strange that's such an that's such an important job it's so important it really is I forgot let's
[23004.25s -> 23030.30s]  go I didn't just sleep most of them can't so what was it they get the summer off yeah but that's
[23030.30s -> 23041.80s]  I mean trust me when I say that having to teach students is like you need that time you need that
[23041.80s -> 23047.02s]  time and teachers aren't just kind of lounging around in a fucking lounge chair for the summer
[23047.02s -> 23052.87s]  a lot of them are planning their lesson plans they you they might not be in the classroom for
[23052.87s -> 23060.49s]  three or four months but they have to get ready they have to get prepared when you go to your
[23060.49s -> 23067.08s]  class right you're not necessarily oh I'm just here and the teachers just got a whole lesson
[23067.08s -> 23073.03s]  plan ready to go now there are a lot of shit teachers I had teachers that I thought were
[23073.03s -> 23078.86s]  fucking terrible but maybe if we incentivized being a fucking teacher and they didn't make
[23078.86s -> 23084.54s]  like fucking like like nine dollars an hour or whatever the fuck it is like on the average
[23084.54s -> 23091.22s]  like 12 dollars an hour or something maybe people will be way more incentivized to be a teacher and
[23091.22s -> 23105.61s]  take it fucking seriously earn his mic up all right honestly I don't I don't care how you
[23105.61s -> 23111.10s]  feel about the world forget about political leanings anything doesn't matter I think we
[23111.10s -> 23119.98s]  can all agree that just like spitted by bed well we could all agree on that we could all agree on
[23119.98s -> 23127.58s]  that uh I think that we really need to make teaching way more incentivized and the lesson
[23127.58s -> 23133.86s]  plan's got to get updated too yeah we I can talk for an hour about this we need to talk about like
[23133.86s -> 23140.31s]  credit and fucking taxes and how to take care of yourself and shit and because I didn't fucking
[23140.31s -> 23147.05s]  learn that stuff till I was like in my mid-20s it's fuck it sucks my parents helped a lot right
[23147.05s -> 23153.51s]  my parents like told me some of these things but man I don't give a fuck about like geometry too
[23154.94s -> 23159.34s]  help me help fucking help these goddamn people help these goddamn kids learn some shit that
[23159.34s -> 23171.78s]  actually helped their life help out their future and shit I didn't give a fuck about geometry too
[23172.50s -> 23176.90s]  geometry is important I fucking hated geometry there's too many fucking lines I didn't like it
[23182.54s -> 23191.45s]  insurance yeah there's like so much shit to know and dude you know what a lot of people don't
[23191.45s -> 23198.49s]  really know what they're doing or what they want to do or what they want to be when they're 16 17
[23198.49s -> 23206.10s]  18 19 and we tell everybody oh hey uh by the way when you're like 17 18 you better know what the
[23206.10s -> 23213.29s]  fuck you want to do with your life go to college immediately go um go to trade school go um I don't
[23213.29s -> 23220.44s]  kind of know what the fuck I want to do I have this opinion that after high school there should
[23220.44s -> 23227.99s]  be a period where like of a year or two maybe even a year it's just a program for you to figure out
[23227.99s -> 23232.63s]  kind of without the anxiety of like oh my god I gotta fucking figure out how I'm gonna pay for
[23232.63s -> 23237.35s]  college I gotta figure out what I want to do with my life a gap year a gap a two-year gap year to
[23237.35s -> 23242.70s]  your two years in a gap for you to be able to figure out what you want to do even if you don't
[23242.70s -> 23246.22s]  get it completely right even if you're not completely exactly correct you'll be closer
[23246.22s -> 23257.38s]  than you were two years ago we we just push kids out of high school directly into another
[23257.38s -> 23263.34s]  thing that they're forced that they feel like they're forced to do and I was one of those
[23263.34s -> 23268.23s]  people I was one of those kids when I was like 17 18 19 I was I didn't know what the fuck I
[23268.23s -> 23274.20s]  wanted to do I thought I did but there is a lot of pressure to be like all right I guess I'm gonna
[23274.20s -> 23278.94s]  go to college or I kind of have to do something right because I gotta do something with my I
[23278.94s -> 23286.74s]  gotta do something with my life like I gotta hurry up I think we should kind of reevaluate that
[23286.74s -> 23310.55s]  people will be way better prepared if programs like that existed 52 we're almost ready to smoke weed
[23310.55s -> 23315.99s]  and this is not like some kind of wow what what a genius topic you're bringing up you're so
[23315.99s -> 23321.03s]  tons of people have thought about this and talked about this right I think it's it would be so
[23321.03s -> 23328.98s]  important because I think of me when I was younger and if I had some time and I could kind of do like
[23328.98s -> 23335.77s]  a pre-college or like a post high school kind of year where it wasn't a bunch of pressure it was
[23335.77s -> 23354.90s]  just all right let's figure it out almost ready and not a big financial burden a bunch bunch of
[23354.90s -> 23364.34s]  money you got to spend because I'm getting heated here when you start to spend a shitload of money
[23364.34s -> 23372.62s]  in the years where you're not sure exactly what you want to do a lot of people kind of get trapped
[23372.62s -> 23377.35s]  and you end up a couple of years in college or even doing like trade school and going into like
[23377.91s -> 23383.56s]  one of like the trade unions or something and if you don't have it right you have thrown a
[23383.56s -> 23392.86s]  shitload of money into the fucking trash I don't think I don't think that's okay I think that sucks
[23392.86s -> 23399.29s]  changing your major tons of people did that tons of people were doing that when I was in college
[23399.29s -> 23403.05s]  and it's like man imagine if you were able to figure that out and then you didn't have to
[23403.05s -> 23419.05s]  have the insane loans for the two or three years or a year or two and you're ready to go tell them
[23419.05s -> 23436.15s]  sis you're explaining how wow we we we we that's not what happened compare it with the rest of the
[23436.15s -> 23447.27s]  world I just think that we we could be doing things a lot better you should do a podcast about this
[23447.27s -> 23453.19s]  no no I'm not smart enough to trust me I am not fucking smart enough I am not the person you want
[23453.19s -> 23459.27s]  to be listening to with this kind of shit I'm just telling you how I feel you do trust me I don't
[23459.27s -> 23465.50s]  have the resources I don't have the brain to handle this kind of stuff I can speak on a couple of
[23465.50s -> 23477.67s]  small things I can that's it come on hurry up and weed hurry up you should be prime minister no I
[23477.67s -> 23496.87s]  should not why is the truck in the ground I probably rolled it's fine and also hmm I think
[23496.87s -> 23505.59s]  that people are inefficient the more that they're doing something excuse me I think that a four-day
[23505.59s -> 23513.19s]  work week increases efficiency excuse me I'm just I'm telling you I think the more that you like
[23513.19s -> 23522.41s]  have to stay and do something in a row you get exhausted and you don't want to do it I'm not
[23522.41s -> 23528.17s]  even a four-day work and look people a lot of people like to kind of really hunker down I know
[23528.17s -> 23535.53s]  people that like no dude I kind of like doing like two fucking 13 12 to 13 hour days in a row
[23535.53s -> 23548.18s]  and then just give me fucking four straight five days off right everyone's kind of different like
[23548.18s -> 23554.58s]  that no man I actually kind of like work I like fucking just bang give me like a big like 24 ounce
[23554.58s -> 23562.74s]  coffee and just I'm going for 14 hours let's fucking go I want to go somebody somebody just

[23577.10s -> 23582.46s]  into my head I just saw it and I was like that's a bad chest that motherfucker got me and I just got
[23582.46s -> 23590.71s]  like bad no I thought I did not excuse me I hold on let me be really clear to some there are people
[23590.71s -> 23597.35s]  that saying oh so you're a socialist that is absolutely not what just happened that is not
[23597.43s -> 23604.70s]  what just happened let's be very clear I want to be incredibly clear that's not what that just was
[23604.70s -> 23614.71s]  okay how is a how is a four-day work week and like a two-day work week where you do like two
[23614.71s -> 23631.56s]  14-hour days in a row that's what are you talking about so you hate socialism I'm gonna sit here

[23673.05s -> 23681.66s]  getting up till you stop listen all I'm saying is we do things we could change it and we'll be
[23681.66s -> 23688.70s]  better we could do we could make some good changes we could make some good changes get me a podium
[23688.70s -> 23710.04s]  put me in front of it let's go I'm telling you right now he's a million I think that we could
