[5.88s -> 28.04s]  Let me just check and see. I should have it ready to go. Alright, so this is, like I said, a compilation of videos that have been submitted, and they have been viewed, and they have been not bought by me.
[28.04s -> 42.57s]  So it's still a surprise, so don't worry. There are 55 videos. We're gonna watch them all. I'm gonna change the title to just green screen.
[43.57s -> 64.28s]  Hopefully Cox behaves, because it looks like it's trying to not behave. Let me go like this. Alright, I believe we are ready. Here comes a Windows sound.
[64.28s -> 85.31s]  Alright, so are you ready? 55 downloads. Welcome to the green screen Encore movie experience. It should take us about an hour to an hour and a half maybe plus to get through all these.
[85.31s -> 104.42s]  Go to like the just chatting section, because that's kind of just what we're doing. We're just hanging out. And here we go. This first one is called Slap Tales. Slap Tales.
[104.42s -> 126.61s]  Let me make sure you can hear it. Yes, you can. Let's turn this shit up though. Slap Tales. How's that sound? Good volume? Sounds like it's pretty good.
[126.61s -> 136.51s]  Oh boy, it is. Here we go. Slap Tales. Oh, you want to fight? You want to fucking fight? Don't fucking come at me. Don't.
[136.51s -> 183.00s]  Okay, hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. That was fucking crazy. This one clip that I like was so scared that this people were gonna like continue to watch this.
[183.00s -> 195.86s]  Put on a face cam? No, no, no. Not for this. I want to see this one again. I'm sorry.
[205.50s -> 229.81s]  Turn it up. Okay. Here comes the next one. It's called Bathroom Battles.
[229.81s -> 246.63s]  Chef Ramsay went into the men's bathroom. Can't believe it. He saw something he would never see in his entire life. You have bleach inside of the sink.
[246.63s -> 253.63s]  How will the blue team be able to recover from this? Will the red team capitalize in the women's bathroom?
[253.63s -> 264.13s]  I just, I couldn't believe it. She actually was trying to hurt me. There's a shotgun in the fucking bathroom. Let's tune in next time.
[264.13s -> 269.89s]  What the fuck is happening? Bathroom battle with Gordon Ramsay.
[269.89s -> 321.00s]  Activate windows. You're using like a bootleg copy of windows? At least 10.
[345.65s -> 355.84s]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall. It's a second dream.
[360.84s -> 364.87s]  What the fuck?
[404.45s -> 407.88s]  What do I have to say about this? See, this is bullshit.
[407.88s -> 415.86s]  Guys, I don't think pineapple belongs on pizza.
[427.80s -> 432.80s]  Tiny Dancer.
[445.64s -> 488.26s]  Okay, I need a second after that. That was fucking crazy. You elongated my chin and my nose. New emote? I'm cross-eyed. What's going on here?
[488.26s -> 491.75s]  Did you do this to me or did I actually look like this?
[491.75s -> 504.61s]  One eye is going this way, the other eye is going the complete opposite direction. Oh man, that was fucking hilarious.
[504.61s -> 517.06s]  Alright, moving on. Here comes the next one. Harder, better, faster German.
[563.63s -> 565.63s]  It's just a song.
[569.63s -> 600.83s]  Harder, better, faster, stronger. Never, ever, after, work is over. Make it, do it, make sense.
[601.83s -> 608.71s]  Harder, better, faster, stronger.
[609.71s -> 615.74s]  Harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.
[615.74s -> 617.74s]  Stronger, make sense.
[617.74s -> 635.11s]  Stronger, never, ever, work is never over.
[635.11s -> 639.11s]  Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.
[639.11s -> 643.11s]  Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.
[643.11s -> 646.11s]  Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.
[646.11s -> 650.11s]  Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.
[650.11s -> 654.11s]  Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.
[654.11s -> 658.11s]  Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.
[658.11s -> 662.11s]  Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.
[662.11s -> 666.11s]  Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.
[666.11s -> 670.11s]  Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.
[670.11s -> 674.11s]  Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.
[677.11s -> 679.11s]  Never over, but it is.
[679.11s -> 705.18s]  It's gonna be burned in my brain.
[710.18s -> 736.94s]  I'm gonna see these images in my head.
[736.94s -> 742.04s]  That's a great song.
[745.46s -> 748.46s]  It's easy for you to say, you're an evil sith.
[748.46s -> 753.27s]  It's hard, but you're not.
[754.90s -> 761.64s]  You are my brother, Anakin. I love you.
[761.64s -> 763.64s]  I fucking hate you.
[776.06s -> 788.44s]  Okay, that was German Wars Episode 3.
[788.44s -> 790.44s]  I wanna see that.
[790.44s -> 797.43s]  It's easy for you to say, you're an evil sith.
[797.43s -> 801.86s]  It's hard, but you're not.
[801.86s -> 811.00s]  You are my brother, Anakin. I love you.
[811.00s -> 813.00s]  I fucking hate you.
[813.00s -> 818.14s]  This is called It Streams.
[818.14s -> 827.68s]  I didn't wanna move here.
[827.68s -> 829.68s]  We couldn't afford to live in the old house anymore.
[829.68s -> 831.68s]  Plus the new story I'm writing is here.
[831.68s -> 833.68s]  Is the story a good one this time?
[833.68s -> 835.68s]  I'm gonna write the best book that anybody's ever read.
[835.68s -> 838.37s]  I got a really good feeling about this.
[838.37s -> 847.78s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[847.78s -> 849.78s]  Family hanging out.
[849.78s -> 851.78s]  Barbecue 79.
[851.78s -> 867.39s]  You think these are serial murders?
[867.39s -> 868.39s]  I don't know.
[868.39s -> 872.45s]  The first one I found dates back to the 60s.
[872.45s -> 876.46s]  The link between all these cases is the symbol.
[876.46s -> 880.46s]  The symbol is associated with a pagan deity named Baguul.
[880.46s -> 887.23s]  He consumes the souls of human children.
[887.23s -> 892.71s]  What does something this big before?
[892.71s -> 898.00s]  Christians believe that Baguul actually lived in the images themselves,
[898.00s -> 901.00s]  and that they were gateways into his realm.
[907.52s -> 909.52s]  What's the matter? What's happened?
[909.52s -> 911.52s]  Get the kids. Pack the car.
[911.52s -> 913.52s]  We have to leave here now.
[915.52s -> 937.22s]  This is fucking...
[937.22s -> 943.02s]  That was great.
[943.02s -> 948.02s]  They're all waiting for the stream to start.
[948.02s -> 952.37s]  That's my favorite part.
[952.37s -> 956.37s]  This next one is called PlayerUnknown's Casino Royale Battle Royale.
[956.37s -> 959.87s]  Okay? Okay.
[983.60s -> 1000.05s]  I didn't even fit it.
[1021.29s -> 1023.29s]  Just get the shit out of me.
[1025.29s -> 1027.59s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1027.59s -> 1033.33s]  Auto with the bonk helmet on.
[1033.33s -> 1041.06s]  That was pretty good.
[1041.06s -> 1043.30s]  That was pretty good.
[1043.30s -> 1045.30s]  This one's called Jerma's Got That.
[1045.30s -> 1048.43s]  Jerma's Got That.
[1083.70s -> 1085.70s]  Fuck!
[1130.31s -> 1133.31s]  Hold on. I want to see that one.
[1134.31s -> 1140.81s]  Hands up, man. I hear a boom.
[1140.81s -> 1160.58s]  It's that easy.
[1162.58s -> 1178.97s]  Space Channel 985.
[1178.97s -> 1215.64s]  Walking around.
[1230.49s -> 1232.49s]  The walk. You got the walk.
[1257.38s -> 1266.34s]  Meow.
[1274.06s -> 1281.68s]  That was fucking awesome.
[1281.68s -> 1296.43s]  Meow.
[1296.43s -> 1298.43s]  How long did it take you to find...
[1298.43s -> 1301.67s]  How long did it take you to find me saying meow?
[1301.67s -> 1312.22s]  I wonder. I don't remember the last time I even said that word.
[1312.22s -> 1314.22s]  That was fucking great. Thank you.
[1314.22s -> 1320.08s]  Well, I just said it right now.
[1320.08s -> 1322.77s]  All right. Coming up next, we have...
[1322.77s -> 1325.65s]  I'm not sure. The Germanator.
[1365.63s -> 1368.63s]  I'm fucking killing both of you motherfuckers right now.
[1404.10s -> 1408.58s]  Surprise, motherfucker!
[1408.58s -> 1435.84s]  Oh, look it.
[1435.84s -> 1444.85s]  Give me that.
[1444.85s -> 1448.37s]  Come here.
[1448.37s -> 1463.25s]  Get out of the way.
[1468.06s -> 1472.74s]  That was just so fun.
[1472.74s -> 1477.09s]  That was fucking great.
[1477.09s -> 1483.13s]  This one's called Rat Groove.
[1483.13s -> 1486.71s]  Rat Groove.
[1505.52s -> 1524.08s]  This is pretty good.
[1524.08s -> 1526.38s]  Hold on.
[1526.38s -> 1528.38s]  Everyone talk shit.
[1528.38s -> 1530.82s]  This is pretty fucking good.
[1530.82s -> 1533.18s]  This is legit good shit.
[1533.18s -> 1535.18s]  Take a look at this.
[1535.18s -> 1537.18s]  No, not that.
[1537.18s -> 1539.55s]  Not that. This.
[1542.24s -> 1545.57s]  This one right here.
[1545.57s -> 1551.58s]  That right there.
[1551.58s -> 1553.58s]  I took dance class.
[1553.58s -> 1555.58s]  And I was like, I don't know, 12.
[1555.58s -> 1563.44s]  Oh, fuck.
[1563.44s -> 1565.44s]  God damn it.
[1565.44s -> 1572.10s]  No, no, no. Stop.
[1572.10s -> 1576.40s]  All right. This one is called Rat Heaven Karate German.
[1614.95s -> 1637.35s]  Ow, my butthole.
[1654.42s -> 1656.66s]  Okay.
[1656.66s -> 1658.84s]  Next one.
[1658.84s -> 1660.84s]  It's called Jerma Goes to the Museum.
[1660.84s -> 1675.18s]  Going to the museum today.
[1675.18s -> 1678.82s]  This is terrible.
[1678.82s -> 1681.77s]  Absolutely terrible.
[1681.77s -> 1683.77s]  Nothing about this is good.
[1683.77s -> 1687.66s]  Not one thing.
[1687.66s -> 1690.84s]  This is the thing I'm talking about right here.
[1690.84s -> 1693.72s]  I've told you guys this before.
[1693.72s -> 1695.72s]  Absolute perfection.
[1695.72s -> 1697.72s]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[1697.72s -> 1699.72s]  This right here.
[1699.72s -> 1701.72s]  Is absolute perfection.
[1701.72s -> 1711.26s]  This is what it looks like up close.
[1713.26s -> 1718.94s]  From back there, this is perfect.
[1718.94s -> 1720.94s]  It's exactly what I was talking about.
[1720.94s -> 1724.14s]  Oh, no.
[1724.14s -> 1726.50s]  Oh, my God.
[1726.50s -> 1733.66s]  Fucking, what a gamer.
[1733.66s -> 1738.18s]  God, seriously.
[1740.49s -> 1742.49s]  Why would you walk around a museum like this?
[1742.49s -> 1745.24s]  You're like the weirdo.
[1745.24s -> 1758.62s]  Turn it up.
[1758.62s -> 1761.30s]  You have to shut this off. Shut them all off.
[1761.30s -> 1763.30s]  Turn your lights in your house off too.
[1763.30s -> 1781.08s]  Yes.
[1781.08s -> 1784.47s]  That's it.
[1784.47s -> 1798.87s]  What did you say?
[1811.98s -> 1813.98s]  Toilet water.
[1813.98s -> 1815.98s]  Why do I have an ad for the second channel?
[1819.30s -> 1826.47s]  Oh, my God.
[1826.47s -> 1829.74s]  Coming up next is Jerma
[1829.74s -> 1831.74s]  versus Jerma.
[1831.74s -> 1839.61s]  Looks like in Smash Brothers.
[1839.61s -> 1846.07s]  I don't want to bite you.
[1846.07s -> 1861.93s]  I don't want to.
[1867.90s -> 1869.90s]  What the fuck is that?
[1869.90s -> 1871.90s]  It's time for you to pay.
[1909.53s -> 1911.90s]  That was fucking hilarious.
[1911.90s -> 1913.90s]  I just want to see one.
[1913.90s -> 1915.90s]  Hold on.
[1915.90s -> 1917.90s]  I just want to see this right here.
[1917.90s -> 1919.90s]  What the fuck is that?
[1921.90s -> 1923.90s]  It's a recovery move.
[1923.90s -> 1925.90s]  It's fucking brilliant.
[1938.89s -> 1941.38s]  What the fuck is that?
[1941.38s -> 1943.38s]  It's time for you to pay.
[1945.38s -> 1947.38s]  Everybody uses
[1947.38s -> 1949.38s]  the end of the stomach
[1949.38s -> 1951.38s]  puke sound thing.
[1951.38s -> 1954.52s]  Jerma Theft Auto
[1954.52s -> 1990.10s]  is coming up next.
[2033.42s -> 2035.59s]  This is my house.
[2037.59s -> 2056.86s]  This is what he's here for.
[2056.86s -> 2058.86s]  He's here for money.
[2058.86s -> 2060.86s]  And he knows.
[2060.86s -> 2062.86s]  I got fucking 700 million bits.
[2062.86s -> 2064.86s]  He knows I have it.
[2079.64s -> 2087.32s]  What the fuck was that?
[2087.32s -> 2089.69s]  Hold on.
[2089.69s -> 2091.69s]  Wait a second.
[2091.69s -> 2104.79s]  Jerma and Odd Michael
[2104.79s -> 2106.79s]  at the water park.
[2106.79s -> 2108.79s]  Why did you do this?
[2118.07s -> 2120.31s]  I can't.
[2120.31s -> 2129.53s]  I'm not trying to replay it.
[2129.53s -> 2131.53s]  I'm trying to pause.
[2131.53s -> 2137.67s]  I'm trying to pause.
[2144.31s -> 2146.74s]  Coming up next.
[2146.74s -> 2148.74s]  I gave special
[2148.74s -> 2151.05s]  permission
[2151.05s -> 2153.05s]  to somebody to make
[2153.05s -> 2155.99s]  a longer video.
[2158.81s -> 2160.81s]  One person has special permission.
[2163.75s -> 2165.75s]  You've known a lot of their videos.
[2165.75s -> 2167.75s]  They do a lot of great content.
[2167.75s -> 2169.75s]  Special permission for this next coming up.
[2169.75s -> 2173.14s]  I have no idea what this is.
[2173.14s -> 2175.14s]  This is nine minutes.
[2175.14s -> 2177.14s]  It's called compact.
[2177.14s -> 2184.18s]  It's a short film.
[2184.18s -> 2187.06s]  If you want to know
[2187.06s -> 2189.37s]  who this is, it is
[2189.37s -> 2191.99s]  Trust No One.
[2191.99s -> 2195.64s]  Trust No One. We've seen at least
[2195.64s -> 2197.64s]  a half dozen hilarious videos
[2197.64s -> 2199.64s]  from Trust No One.
[2199.64s -> 2203.99s]  You guys get the popcorn ready.
[2203.99s -> 2206.30s]  Here we go.
[2206.30s -> 2208.30s]  We'll probably take a pee break after this.
[2208.30s -> 2210.79s]  We'll see where we are.
[2210.79s -> 2231.38s]  That was me.
[2231.38s -> 2267.80s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[2278.02s -> 2280.02s]  I killed like ten birds with one stone.
[2282.02s -> 2284.02s]  My pants almost ripped in half.
[2311.05s -> 2340.09s]  Fucking idiot.
[2387.50s -> 2392.15s]  You want to fight?
[2392.15s -> 2394.46s]  Don't come at me.
[2394.46s -> 2436.36s]  I hate it.
[2443.93s -> 2473.05s]  It doesn't even work.
[2475.05s -> 2477.86s]  Oh my god.
[2477.86s -> 2520.22s]  Made it to the top.
[2520.22s -> 2533.13s]  Fuck you.
[2533.13s -> 2540.94s]  What?
[2540.94s -> 2550.60s]  Come on, you can do it.
[2550.60s -> 2575.05s]  You can do it.
[2575.05s -> 2584.58s]  Oh shit.
[2584.58s -> 2586.58s]  Who's your daddy?
[2586.58s -> 2601.24s]  Constant conflict.
[2601.24s -> 2608.28s]  Constant conflict.
[2608.28s -> 2610.28s]  Nobody use that.
[2610.28s -> 2625.30s]  You'll be in big trouble.
[2625.30s -> 2637.32s]  Holy shit.
[2640.65s -> 2647.11s]  Nobody use that.
[2653.62s -> 2658.68s]  What the fuck is that?
[2658.68s -> 2683.05s]  Really?
[2683.05s -> 2690.33s]  Did I make it?
[2766.02s -> 2768.02s]  I'm 30.
[2768.02s -> 2770.02s]  You don't get any taller?
[2770.02s -> 2773.16s]  Alright, first of all
[2773.16s -> 2775.16s]  that was fucking insane.
[2775.16s -> 2777.16s]  That was absolutely fucking unbelievable.
[2777.16s -> 2783.43s]  Thank you, trust no one
[2783.43s -> 2785.43s]  for your full on
[2785.43s -> 2787.43s]  ten minute short film.
[2787.43s -> 2799.26s]  That was so good.
[2799.26s -> 2801.26s]  Academy Award nominee for short film
[2801.26s -> 2806.76s]  in 2019.
[2806.76s -> 2808.76s]  In the literal sense too.
[2813.93s -> 2815.93s]  Alright, let me see something real quick.
[2815.93s -> 2818.17s]  I want to see where we are in the
[2818.17s -> 2820.17s]  playlist.
[2820.17s -> 2822.92s]  I don't want any spoilers here.
[2822.92s -> 2824.92s]  We're almost
[2824.92s -> 2827.29s]  at halfway.
[2827.29s -> 2829.29s]  We'll do another five or six more and
[2829.29s -> 2832.30s]  we'll go pee.
[2832.30s -> 2834.30s]  There's probably a couple more.
[2834.30s -> 2836.47s]  We'll be almost at the halfway mark.
[2836.47s -> 2840.94s]  This next one is called
[2840.94s -> 2842.94s]  Germ of the Celery Man.
[2842.94s -> 2854.06s]  Good morning, Paul.
[2854.06s -> 2856.06s]  What will your first sequence of the day be?
[2856.06s -> 2858.06s]  Computer load up Celery Man, please.
[2858.06s -> 2860.06s]  Yes, Paul.
[2860.06s -> 2873.24s]  Could you
[2873.24s -> 2875.24s]  kick up the 43...
[2875.24s -> 2877.24s]  D3...
[2887.03s -> 2890.04s]  Alright.
[2890.04s -> 2892.04s]  Here comes the Germba 95 anime
[2892.04s -> 2894.28s]  opening?
[2894.28s -> 2918.46s]  Here we go.
[2918.46s -> 2988.50s]  Not even my real name.
[3010.78s -> 3013.27s]  Why do we...
[3013.27s -> 3015.27s]  What is this?
[3015.27s -> 3017.27s]  You still don't seem to get it, so maybe I just need to spell it out for you more clearly.
[3017.27s -> 3019.27s]  See, you have no chances
[3019.27s -> 3021.27s]  of beating me. None whatsoever.
[3021.27s -> 3023.27s]  Zip, zilch, serum.
[3023.27s -> 3025.27s]  No matter how hard you try, there's simply no
[3025.27s -> 3027.27s]  version of this fight where you come out on top.
[3027.27s -> 3029.27s]  Sorry, no dice.
[3029.27s -> 3031.27s]  You sure are talking a lot. Oh, look at me.
[3031.27s -> 3033.27s]  You know that? No, I didn't do it right.
[3033.27s -> 3049.40s]  Who would have ever thought
[3049.40s -> 3051.40s]  it'd be this ridiculously easy
[3051.40s -> 3053.40s]  for me to make a fool out of myself?
[3082.12s -> 3084.12s]  What?
[3084.12s -> 3086.12s]  Did you really think something like that was going to work on me?
[3086.12s -> 3088.12s]  This is a move made up by a little kid.
[3088.12s -> 3090.12s]  You're getting pretty desperate if that's the best you've got.
[3090.12s -> 3092.12s]  I just shit my pants.
[3092.12s -> 3094.12s]  I can't do it anymore.
[3094.12s -> 3096.12s]  So what to do now?
[3096.12s -> 3106.54s]  Hmm.
[3106.54s -> 3108.54s]  What are you waiting for? Get your act together already.
[3108.54s -> 3110.54s]  Ten seconds.
[3110.54s -> 3112.54s]  I'll give you that long to say your prayers.
[3112.54s -> 3114.54s]  Or whatever it is you need to do, then I'll blast you to hell.
[3114.54s -> 3116.54s]  Okay.
[3116.54s -> 3119.16s]  Here I go.
[3119.16s -> 3125.37s]  I can't just do it.
[3125.37s -> 3127.37s]  I can't just do it.
[3127.37s -> 3129.37s]  You are into a corner, there's only one thing to do.
[3129.37s -> 3131.37s]  So just do it.
[3131.37s -> 3133.37s]  Interesting thought process.
[3137.37s -> 3139.37s]  Not my head!
[3160.52s -> 3162.52s]  You're the one who should be saved.
[3170.22s -> 3172.22s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[3172.22s -> 3174.22s]  This is really important.
[3174.22s -> 3176.22s]  You need to understand something.
[3176.22s -> 3178.22s]  This is a doctored image.
[3178.22s -> 3180.46s]  This is not even my head.
[3180.46s -> 3187.16s]  This is not my head.
[3187.16s -> 3189.16s]  Where is it?
[3189.16s -> 3192.68s]  Interesting thought process.
[3192.68s -> 3194.98s]  That's not my head.
[3194.98s -> 3198.44s]  That's not the top of my head.
[3198.44s -> 3200.81s]  That's a Photoshop job.
[3200.81s -> 3206.70s]  Look.
[3206.70s -> 3215.58s]  Where am I?
[3215.58s -> 3219.22s]  That's not the top of my head.
[3219.22s -> 3222.81s]  You understand?
[3222.81s -> 3234.65s]  Don't believe the lies.
[3234.65s -> 3238.04s]  Nice wig.
[3238.04s -> 3240.54s]  Okay, break.
[3240.54s -> 3243.80s]  Coming up next is...
[3243.80s -> 3245.80s]  Bizarre Adventure.
[3248.79s -> 3255.32s]  Here we go!
[3298.49s -> 3300.49s]  No!
[3332.15s -> 3334.46s]  That was really good.
[3334.46s -> 3367.61s]  That was really good.
[3367.61s -> 3369.61s]  Hold on.
[3369.61s -> 3371.61s]  We don't want to get any spoilers.
[3371.61s -> 3373.61s]  I keep fucking going to this.
[3373.61s -> 3376.42s]  I don't want any spoilers.
[3376.42s -> 3379.69s]  Alright.
[3379.69s -> 3382.82s]  Let's take a quick pee break.
[3382.82s -> 3388.44s]  I'll see you guys in like two minutes.
[3388.44s -> 3390.44s]  We're at pretty much the halfway point.
[3390.44s -> 3392.44s]  There is more to see.
[3392.44s -> 3396.54s]  I gotta get some water or something.
[3396.54s -> 3399.54s]  My face is starting to hurt.
[3399.54s -> 3401.54s]  See you guys in like two minutes, three minutes.
[3404.04s -> 3586.62s]  I'm back.
[3586.62s -> 3588.62s]  So far these have been fucking fantastic.
[3588.62s -> 3597.96s]  He's back, he's back.
[3597.96s -> 3603.96s]  Yeah, I'm back.
[3603.96s -> 3605.96s]  Alright, so coming up next, this one is called
[3605.96s -> 3610.50s]  Hyperdimension Germania.
[3610.50s -> 3614.66s]  Elbertson Breaker.
[3614.66s -> 3618.95s]  Sounds good to me.
[3618.95s -> 3621.64s]  Already got an interesting start.
[3621.64s -> 3625.86s]  You ready?
[3625.86s -> 3631.18s]  Three, two, one, here we go.
[3631.18s -> 3633.18s]  Life is paint.
[3633.18s -> 3640.66s]  You're dead.
[3640.66s -> 3662.04s]  I hate...
[3662.04s -> 3672.09s]  Jesus!
[3672.09s -> 3675.16s]  Oh no!
[3675.16s -> 3677.16s]  Please! Oh my god!
[3677.16s -> 3685.08s]  Yes!
[3685.08s -> 3687.08s]  Dry thunder for clean machine.
[3687.08s -> 3689.08s]  Vroom vroom!
[3689.08s -> 3691.08s]  Where's your teeth going?
[3706.06s -> 3709.26s]  Who the fuck is that guy?
[3709.26s -> 3716.47s]  What?
[3716.47s -> 3726.97s]  I gotta say this one again.
[3726.97s -> 3731.90s]  Who the fuck is that guy?
[3731.90s -> 3735.93s]  This is...
[3735.93s -> 3742.31s]  I love this one.
[3742.31s -> 3744.31s]  This one is called
[3744.31s -> 3746.31s]  Images of German 985
[3746.31s -> 3748.31s]  Real.
[3748.31s -> 3751.00s]  Do not watch at night.
[3751.00s -> 3753.00s]  Hopefully it's not night, wherever any of you are.
[3792.79s -> 3809.22s]  Which?
[3809.22s -> 3811.22s]  German Beat Undertale.
[3811.22s -> 3844.44s]  Come here.
[3844.44s -> 3846.44s]  Come here.
[3846.44s -> 3848.44s]  Come here.
[3848.44s -> 3850.44s]  I'm gonna push you and you all
[3850.44s -> 3852.44s]  watch this dog shit.
[3852.44s -> 3854.44s]  Just get in there.
[3854.44s -> 3860.26s]  Oh Jesus!
[3860.26s -> 3862.26s]  Oh no!
[3862.26s -> 3866.30s]  I don't know!
[3878.30s -> 3880.30s]  What?
[3880.30s -> 3882.30s]  Okay.
[3882.30s -> 3891.75s]  Wait, is this a new video?
[3891.75s -> 3893.75s]  What?
[3897.75s -> 3908.76s]  I saved the world right here.
[3908.76s -> 3916.25s]  I just saved the world.
[3916.25s -> 3918.25s]  What?
[3918.25s -> 3920.25s]  Why was I in Minecraft?
[3920.25s -> 3927.42s]  Oh by the way,
[3927.42s -> 3929.42s]  in any of these videos
[3929.42s -> 3931.42s]  there could be some television show
[3931.42s -> 3933.42s]  or animated show
[3933.42s -> 3935.42s]  or cartoon
[3935.42s -> 3937.42s]  or they might just yell out
[3937.42s -> 3939.42s]  a spoiler for your favorite show.
[3939.42s -> 3941.42s]  Somebody may have been watching that
[3941.42s -> 3943.42s]  in the middle of that game.
[3943.42s -> 3945.42s]  Just be aware that if you see a show
[3945.42s -> 3947.42s]  that you've been watching or that you will watch
[3947.42s -> 3949.72s]  just go to the bathroom or something
[3949.72s -> 3955.46s]  and come back.
[3955.46s -> 3957.46s]  Germando.
[3957.46s -> 3970.33s]  This is a 2018 trailer for Germando.
[3979.77s -> 3981.77s]  I want your kid back.
[3981.77s -> 3983.77s]  Then you gotta cooperate.
[3983.77s -> 3985.77s]  Right? Wrong.
[3985.77s -> 3987.77s]  Now
[3987.77s -> 3989.77s]  somewhere
[3989.77s -> 3991.77s]  somehow
[3991.77s -> 3993.77s]  someone's gonna pay.
[3993.77s -> 4003.03s]  Do you think that he is going
[4003.03s -> 4005.03s]  to give us any problems?
[4005.03s -> 4007.03s]  Move up in smoke!
[4007.03s -> 4009.03s]  Do exactly as he's told.
[4009.03s -> 4011.03s]  Hasta luego, fellas.
[4011.03s -> 4013.03s]  You're free, guys.
[4013.03s -> 4015.03s]  I'm going to kill you last.
[4015.03s -> 4017.03s]  Are you going to tell me what's going on or what?
[4017.03s -> 4019.03s]  No.
[4019.03s -> 4021.03s]  He's dead. He's gone.
[4021.03s -> 4023.03s]  But it was not informed about this.
[4023.03s -> 4025.34s]  Are you trying to do this all by yourself?
[4025.34s -> 4027.34s]  I think you know what I'm going to do probably.
[4029.34s -> 4034.01s]  Do you eat ass?
[4034.01s -> 4036.01s]  The answer is no.
[4036.01s -> 4038.01s]  I do not eat ass.
[4038.01s -> 4047.61s]  Why?
[4047.61s -> 4055.93s]  It's a mission
[4055.93s -> 4057.93s]  no man can survive.
[4057.93s -> 4059.93s]  I'm sorry.
[4059.93s -> 4064.34s]  Schwarzenegger here with a Team Fortress 2
[4064.34s -> 4066.34s]  gameplay commentary.
[4099.19s -> 4101.37s]  I'm the captain now.
[4101.37s -> 4103.67s]  Interesting thought process.
[4103.67s -> 4105.67s]  Look at me! Look at me!
[4105.67s -> 4109.51s]  That's what you sound like.
[4109.51s -> 4111.51s]  Roger, stop the tow.
[4111.51s -> 4115.35s]  Loot get!
[4117.35s -> 4119.35s]  He's blind to the watch!
[4119.35s -> 4121.35s]  What?
[4147.85s -> 4152.14s]  I'm seeing stars.
[4152.14s -> 4154.44s]  Hold on.
[4154.44s -> 4157.58s]  If you've never seen
[4157.58s -> 4159.58s]  that movie
[4159.58s -> 4161.58s]  just be aware
[4161.58s -> 4163.58s]  that you might
[4163.58s -> 4165.58s]  have seen the whole thing.
[4165.58s -> 4169.93s]  God damn it.
[4169.93s -> 4179.91s]  What the fuck?
[4179.91s -> 4181.91s]  There was so much going on there.
[4181.91s -> 4183.91s]  There was so much stupid shit
[4183.91s -> 4189.29s]  that he'd put...
[4189.29s -> 4191.29s]  I need a minute.
[4191.29s -> 4193.29s]  I was literally seeing white specks
[4193.29s -> 4195.78s]  in my vision.
[4195.78s -> 4206.98s]  That was fucked.
[4206.98s -> 4208.98s]  No, it's because I was out of air.
[4208.98s -> 4210.98s]  I was laughing
[4210.98s -> 4212.98s]  a lot.
[4212.98s -> 4214.98s]  The face with my...
[4214.98s -> 4216.98s]  It was too much for my brain.
[4224.26s -> 4226.26s]  German is the captain now
[4226.26s -> 4228.76s]  and now we're gonna move on to
[4230.76s -> 4233.06s]  Sonic the Hedgehog
[4233.06s -> 4235.37s]  live action Sonic the Hedgehog
[4235.37s -> 4237.37s]  official reveal or something.
[4239.37s -> 4249.34s]  That's what you sound like.
[4262.39s -> 4264.39s]  Ow.
[4265.39s -> 4272.67s]  That's what you sound like.
[4272.67s -> 4294.50s]  Ooh, up in smoke.
[4303.60s -> 4317.09s]  Oh shit, another witness.
[4317.09s -> 4319.09s]  This is a pretty good beach party.
[4319.09s -> 4321.09s]  What's that guy doing?
[4341.70s -> 4376.00s]  Oh no, they're killing each other.
[4376.00s -> 4388.03s]  Give me that shotgun.
[4388.03s -> 4390.03s]  Shoot him with the shotgun.
[4396.14s -> 4398.14s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[4398.14s -> 4408.44s]  That's a new subject.
[4408.44s -> 4411.51s]  We need to take up the back.
[4411.51s -> 4413.51s]  We need to send in our music first.
[4413.51s -> 4415.51s]  We need to send in the pipes first.
[4485.56s -> 4488.12s]  This is the best part right here.
[4491.12s -> 4493.12s]  Okay, we are clear.
[4493.12s -> 4497.47s]  Houston, we have list off.
[4497.47s -> 4530.82s]  Watch out for that asshole.
[4530.82s -> 4535.87s]  I knew it was coming too and it scared me.
[4535.87s -> 4541.38s]  That was fucking awesome.
[4541.38s -> 4546.05s]  That was fucking great.
[4546.05s -> 4551.96s]  You guys are fucking awesome.
[4551.96s -> 4553.96s]  Alright, Jerva gets into a fight.
[4553.96s -> 4557.22s]  Let's see how this one plays out.
[4601.94s -> 4618.26s]  My favorite part is
[4618.26s -> 4620.26s]  like I said before
[4620.26s -> 4622.26s]  into the stomach puke.
[4622.26s -> 4624.26s]  I got hit during
[4624.26s -> 4626.26s]  that green screen when I was
[4626.26s -> 4628.82s]  in front of it. I took like
[4628.82s -> 4630.82s]  in the shoulder, in the back
[4630.82s -> 4632.82s]  the ten different injuries into the stomach.
[4632.82s -> 4635.96s]  But everybody
[4635.96s -> 4637.96s]  just uses the puke and I think that's
[4637.96s -> 4640.20s]  I love that because there's so many other
[4640.20s -> 4643.34s]  options. Do we always
[4643.34s -> 4645.34s]  see this one? I don't remember.
[4645.34s -> 4647.34s]  This Jerva's in the kitchen.
[4650.34s -> 4667.18s]  Well, I'm something of a scientist myself.
[4669.42s -> 4673.06s]  What?
[4673.06s -> 4675.06s]  Wait, hold on.
[4675.06s -> 4683.94s]  Got faded.
[4683.94s -> 4685.94s]  That was not one we have seen.
[4685.94s -> 4688.70s]  This is called Late Night Weatherman
[4688.70s -> 4690.70s]  Jerva 985 Green Screen Movie Night.
[4690.70s -> 4695.05s]  Here we go.
[4713.58s -> 4715.58s]  That's just a big old soap
[4715.58s -> 4718.07s]  if you know what I'm saying.
[4718.07s -> 4720.07s]  Fuck this Jerva.
[4720.07s -> 4722.07s]  You know typically I bring you the weather
[4722.07s -> 4724.07s]  but today I want to show you something
[4724.07s -> 4726.07s]  different. I want to show you
[4726.07s -> 4728.07s]  something that I care about.
[4728.07s -> 4730.07s]  Something that I want to show.
[4730.07s -> 4732.07s]  That I haven't been having on. I had no opportunity to do it till now.
[4732.07s -> 4738.90s]  Diane
[4738.90s -> 4740.90s]  that's my son. I just wanted to show
[4740.90s -> 4744.62s]  her. I don't know.
[4744.62s -> 4757.40s]  And Diane go fuck show business.
[4757.40s -> 4760.22s]  That was fucking awesome.
[4766.04s -> 4778.01s]  This is part one
[4778.01s -> 4793.50s]  coming up. Wait,
[4793.50s -> 4795.50s]  hold on. Did you guys hear me? Was I muted?
[4795.50s -> 4797.86s]  Oh, I'm sorry. I was muted.
[4797.86s -> 4799.86s]  I said this might be a, if you've never
[4799.86s -> 4802.36s]  seen a television show, just, I don't know.
[4802.36s -> 4811.05s]  Get spoiled.
[4821.93s -> 4823.93s]  Go fuck yourself.
[4833.93s -> 4840.52s]  Now that's funny.
[4840.52s -> 4842.52s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[4842.52s -> 4844.52s]  It's funny because it's Jero-Jero.
[4856.23s -> 4865.83s]  I don't have very much to say
[4865.83s -> 4867.83s]  right now. Besides, here comes
[4867.83s -> 4870.71s]  Jerva Blanca.
[4870.71s -> 4879.61s]  Fuck you.
[4879.61s -> 4902.78s]  Fuck you.
[4902.78s -> 4924.46s]  What?
[4924.46s -> 4927.21s]  What is that? What just happened?
[4927.21s -> 4932.46s]  Why?
[4932.46s -> 4934.46s]  Why? What?
[4934.46s -> 4936.46s]  Don't forget about me. The newest turtle.
[4936.46s -> 4938.46s]  Socrates. I may be small
[4938.46s -> 4940.46s]  but I sure got lots of power.
[4940.46s -> 4943.40s]  I trust you correctly. I slash
[4943.40s -> 4945.40s]  those buddies like nobody's business.
[4945.40s -> 4947.40s]  Check me out.
[4947.40s -> 4949.40s]  You'll see a little bit of footage right here.
[4968.02s -> 4972.12s]  Don't touch it.
[4972.12s -> 4977.43s]  Don't touch it.
[4977.43s -> 4982.94s]  Don't touch it.
[4982.94s -> 4991.90s]  Spoilers
[4991.90s -> 4993.90s]  for every movie
[4993.90s -> 4997.16s]  ever made.
[4997.16s -> 4999.16s]  The climax of every movie.
[4999.16s -> 5005.37s]  In case you were wondering.
[5005.37s -> 5023.14s]  What a god
[5023.14s -> 5025.14s]  of a gamer, seriously.
[5025.14s -> 5029.62s]  Slow go-
[5029.62s -> 5031.93s]  Knock, knock. Who's there?
[5031.93s -> 5036.15s]  Hi. Hi. Hi.
[5036.15s -> 5039.74s]  Hi.
[5039.74s -> 5063.98s]  You're a scientist.
[5063.98s -> 5100.46s]  Relaxing or like I'm being
[5100.46s -> 5102.46s]  tortured in a dungeon.
[5102.46s -> 5108.09s]  It could be both. I think it works
[5108.09s -> 5128.38s]  for both.
[5128.38s -> 5138.55s]  That was pretty good though.
[5138.55s -> 5141.11s]  Next meme.
[5141.11s -> 5144.18s]  That's true.
[5144.18s -> 5146.18s]  Jerva plays- Jerva plays
[5146.18s -> 5150.34s]  Lobotomy Corporation.
[5150.34s -> 5152.90s]  I never did this.
[5152.90s -> 5155.27s]  This is the chat. Jerva went
[5155.27s -> 5157.90s]  and he actually went live.
[5157.90s -> 5162.18s]  What? I'm actually
[5162.18s -> 5164.18s]  really, really, really curious about this one.
[5164.18s -> 5201.10s]  Let's go.
[5201.10s -> 5203.10s]  I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it.
[5231.80s -> 5233.80s]  What a reference. What a
[5233.80s -> 5236.42s]  callback.
[5236.42s -> 5239.18s]  Here's the Nintendo Direct.
[5239.18s -> 5249.02s]  Did you make this?
[5249.02s -> 5256.12s]  Why is this here? Fortnite.
[5256.12s -> 5264.25s]  The gates to the burning
[5264.25s -> 5266.25s]  walls will open on Nintendo Switch.
[5266.25s -> 5268.74s]  Of course, we're talking
[5268.74s -> 5270.74s]  about Diablo 3.
[5270.74s -> 5272.74s]  The dark fantasy adventure that may just
[5272.74s -> 5274.74s]  consume your life both inside and
[5274.74s -> 5276.74s]  outside the game world.
[5276.74s -> 5278.74s]  Play as a demon hunter, barbarian,
[5278.74s -> 5280.74s]  crusader, necromancer,
[5280.74s -> 5282.74s]  witch doctor, monk
[5282.74s -> 5284.74s]  or wizard. Diablo 3
[5284.74s -> 5286.74s]  Eternal Collection invades
[5286.74s -> 5288.74s]  Nintendo Switch on November 2.
[5288.74s -> 5292.65s]  We're making this
[5292.65s -> 5298.28s]  party super.
[5298.28s -> 5300.28s]  Wait, I can catch that in midair? Are you kidding me?
[5300.28s -> 5302.28s]  That's going to be a fucking highlight reel. Watch this.
[5302.28s -> 5305.48s]  Alright. I'm ready.
[5305.48s -> 5307.48s]  Okay. I'm going to catch
[5307.48s -> 5316.25s]  it in my mouth. What is that?
[5320.84s -> 5335.03s]  Here it comes.
[5335.03s -> 5339.37s]  You got me. You got me.
[5339.37s -> 5341.37s]  You got me.
[5345.08s -> 5347.08s]  We have to be getting... No, don't sleep on the
[5347.08s -> 5349.08s]  turnbuckle again.
[5349.08s -> 5352.01s]  No.
[5352.01s -> 5354.01s]  I fucking hated this so much.
[5354.01s -> 5357.08s]  When that crashed...
[5357.08s -> 5359.08s]  That was the worst thing ever when it happened.
[5359.08s -> 5361.77s]  Official Blu-ray 2019
[5361.77s -> 5363.77s]  trailer HD2108P
[5363.77s -> 5365.77s]  IMDB... What's the title of this?
[5365.77s -> 5382.39s]  Does this have a title?
[5382.39s -> 5384.39s]  I died like 25 years
[5384.39s -> 5391.03s]  ago and I'm just in the house.
[5391.03s -> 5393.03s]  I wish I had the time and money to be able to go
[5393.03s -> 5395.03s]  anywhere I wanted to go.
[5404.36s -> 5406.36s]  And I've been going crazy, guys.
[5406.36s -> 5409.24s]  I've been losing my mind.
[5409.24s -> 5427.48s]  What the hell is going on?
[5427.48s -> 5430.74s]  We don't fucking choose sides.
[5430.74s -> 5432.74s]  25 non-smoker. When am I going to...
[5432.74s -> 5434.74s]  What's my death clock here?
[5434.74s -> 5436.74s]  Friday, July 4th, 2019.
[5436.74s -> 5460.94s]  Is this what you fucking
[5460.94s -> 5464.58s]  wanted?
[5464.58s -> 5467.14s]  The best thing
[5467.14s -> 5469.70s]  about this is
[5469.70s -> 5472.46s]  that could seriously have been
[5472.46s -> 5474.89s]  any trailer
[5474.89s -> 5476.89s]  in the last 5 to 10 years.
[5476.89s -> 5483.03s]  It was perfect. Comes out today.
[5483.03s -> 5485.27s]  Well, there you go.
[5485.27s -> 5490.65s]  Hope it's good.
[5490.65s -> 5494.04s]  The best thing about
[5494.04s -> 5496.04s]  going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[5496.04s -> 5500.84s]  Wait till he lands.
[5500.84s -> 5503.21s]  Interesting
[5503.21s -> 5505.21s]  thought process. Look at me!
[5505.21s -> 5507.21s]  Look at me! That's what you sound like.
[5507.21s -> 5514.30s]  Look at me!
[5514.30s -> 5516.30s]  What does that say?
[5516.30s -> 5518.30s]  This stream sucks.
[5518.30s -> 5520.30s]  Hey, fellas!
[5520.30s -> 5525.99s]  Ooh, up in smoke!
[5525.99s -> 5532.01s]  You're right on time, detectives.
[5532.01s -> 5534.01s]  It appears that the victim
[5534.01s -> 5536.01s]  was burned alive after
[5536.01s -> 5538.01s]  flying into the suspect's office
[5538.01s -> 5540.01s]  last night. We haven't located
[5540.01s -> 5542.01s]  any witnesses and there doesn't seem
[5542.01s -> 5544.01s]  to be any source coin for the fire.
[5544.01s -> 5546.01s]  Almost as if they suddenly
[5546.01s -> 5548.01s]  combusted it.
[5548.01s -> 5550.01s]  Well, you know what they say.
[5550.01s -> 5552.01s]  Smoke him if he got him.
[5560.65s -> 5563.98s]  Why? There's been two of those.
[5563.98s -> 5571.59s]  I love this.
[5571.59s -> 5574.02s]  Alright, coming up next.
[5574.02s -> 5576.02s]  We have Jerma's fantastic
[5576.02s -> 5581.00s]  journey.
[5581.00s -> 5583.00s]  Looks like we've got a potential balloon
[5583.00s -> 5586.84s]  video here.
[5588.84s -> 5632.94s]  That was
[5632.94s -> 5634.94s]  cute. That was cute.
[5634.94s -> 5636.94s]  That was really cute. I like that one.
[5636.94s -> 5638.94s]  This is the best TV news
[5638.94s -> 5640.94s]  blooper fails. I think
[5640.94s -> 5642.94s]  this is an encore of an encore
[5642.94s -> 5644.94s]  just in case people didn't see this one because
[5644.94s -> 5646.94s]  this is great. I believe
[5646.94s -> 5648.94s]  this is another one that we have seen before, maybe?
[5648.94s -> 5653.40s]  Here we go.
[5655.40s -> 5657.40s]  An occupational hazard while shooting a story can be
[5657.40s -> 5659.40s]  he was standing beside a skate ramp
[5659.40s -> 5661.40s]  when this happened.
[5667.40s -> 5669.40s]  Just take eight double
[5669.40s -> 5671.40s]  stuffed Oreos and put them in a glass.
[5671.40s -> 5673.40s]  Fill it up with milk and eat it with a spoon.
[5673.40s -> 5675.40s]  The Ninja Turtle, Michelangelo,
[5675.40s -> 5677.40s]  made an appearance
[5677.40s -> 5679.40s]  in July.
[5679.40s -> 5681.40s]  To draw attention
[5681.40s -> 5683.40s]  to our collection of Burke
[5683.40s -> 5686.60s]  Oreos.
[5686.60s -> 5688.60s]  Come on now.
[5698.47s -> 5700.47s]  I mean, come on.
[5700.47s -> 5702.47s]  Look at him.
[5702.47s -> 5705.16s]  He looks
[5705.16s -> 5707.16s]  really pleased to be there.
[5707.16s -> 5709.16s]  Wow, that was really dramatic.
[5709.16s -> 5711.16s]  There's a reason they call these people
[5711.16s -> 5713.16s]  heroes. I mean,
[5713.16s -> 5715.16s]  they were going at a really good clip there.
[5715.16s -> 5717.16s]  We've had some hot weather, I guess.
[5717.16s -> 5719.16s]  Yes.
[5719.16s -> 5721.16s]  That's right.
[5721.16s -> 5723.16s]  Send something, please.
[5723.16s -> 5725.16s]  Baltimore Ravens running back.
[5725.16s -> 5727.16s]  Ray Rice breaks his silence today, apologizing
[5727.16s -> 5729.16s]  to his wife and his fans for the allegations
[5729.16s -> 5731.16s]  that he attacked his wife, knocking her
[5731.16s -> 5733.16s]  unconscious in a casino
[5733.16s -> 5735.53s]  elevator this last February.
[5735.53s -> 5737.53s]  They're trading back and forth. Blue
[5737.53s -> 5739.53s]  men and German. Blue men and German.
[5739.53s -> 5741.53s]  Wait a minute. That is not the right
[5741.53s -> 5743.53s]  video, but Rice has been
[5743.53s -> 5745.53s]  suspended.
[5747.53s -> 5749.53s]  Scandals happen all the time.
[5749.53s -> 5751.53s]  The question is how do democracies respond
[5751.53s -> 5753.53s]  to those scandals?
[5753.53s -> 5755.53s]  And what will it mean for
[5755.53s -> 5757.53s]  the wider region? I think one of your
[5757.53s -> 5759.53s]  children has just walked in. I mean, shifting
[5759.53s -> 5761.53s]  sands in the region. Do you think
[5761.53s -> 5763.53s]  relations with the north may change?
[5763.53s -> 5765.53s]  I would be surprised if they do.
[5768.60s -> 5770.60s]  Pardon me.
[5770.60s -> 5772.60s]  I love this one.
[5772.60s -> 5774.60s]  My apologies.
[5774.60s -> 5776.97s]  My apologies.
[5799.64s -> 5801.64s]  Derva opens the door.
[5824.66s -> 5826.66s]  That was sick.
[5843.80s -> 5849.43s]  Here's what I have to say about
[5849.43s -> 5851.43s]  this. Don't do it.
[5851.43s -> 5853.67s]  Don't do it.
[5855.85s -> 5858.79s]  Holy shit.
[5867.67s -> 5873.54s]  How it feels to chew
[5873.54s -> 5875.54s]  five gum.
[5875.54s -> 5878.36s]  Stimulate your
[5878.36s -> 5882.84s]  senses.
[5882.84s -> 5887.96s]  You want to fight?
[5887.96s -> 5889.96s]  Don't come at me.
[5889.96s -> 5892.84s]  You did it.
[5892.84s -> 5894.84s]  You did it.
[5894.84s -> 5896.84s]  I got a bucket of chicken.
[5896.84s -> 5906.55s]  Don't come at me.
[5906.55s -> 5908.55s]  Don't come at me.
[5918.25s -> 5924.14s]  That's three.
[5924.14s -> 5930.52s]  That's strike three.
[5930.52s -> 5932.52s]  This is called
[5932.52s -> 5934.52s]  unfinished
[5934.52s -> 5936.52s]  bad coffee Cheetos chicken.
[5936.52s -> 5941.06s]  Looks pretty cool.
[5941.06s -> 6021.51s]  Here we go.
[6043.61s -> 6047.83s]  Let's go.
[6047.83s -> 6079.13s]  Hey, man! Welcome to the stream!
[6079.13s -> 6084.49s]  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. So that was pretty well done. That was pretty well done.
[6085.13s -> 6090.81s]  This is also 8 minutes and 41 seconds, you're noticing. This is Kewo's. I believe these are
[6090.81s -> 6097.88s]  Kewo's edits. For those of you that don't know Kewo, she's hilarious, really talented, really
[6097.88s -> 6103.75s]  funny person, and obviously wanted to show these. We did watch them before,
[6105.38s -> 6108.26s]  like maybe a couple months back. I'm not sure we watched them all, though.
[6110.15s -> 6119.70s]  So a couple people get some extra time, but I did want to show these, so here we go.
[6121.56s -> 6125.56s]  My name's Jerma, nice to meet you. Right there, bingo! Right there, that's the follow button.
[6125.56s -> 6128.98s]  If you click that, every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming.
[6129.62s -> 6132.98s]  And I do lots of fun things on this stream, like...
[6135.03s -> 6139.11s]  Wait, what? I just get like an ad. That's the first ad I see.
[6143.59s -> 6146.55s]  I thought that was in the video for a second. I was like, I don't remember that being in
[6146.55s -> 6153.61s]  the video. All right, let's go again. Welcome to the stream. My name's Jerma,
[6153.61s -> 6157.05s]  nice to meet you. Right there, bingo! Right there, that's the follow button. If you click that,
[6157.77s -> 6162.81s]  every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming. And I do lots of fun things on this
[6162.81s -> 6171.48s]  stream, like playing Hitman. We played that last night. That's it, it's right there.
[6173.88s -> 6192.78s]  You should have acted. They're already here. The Elder Scrolls told of their return.
[6195.70s -> 6203.13s]  Their defeat was merely a delay for the time after Oblivion opened,
[6206.50s -> 6209.78s]  when the Sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.
[6216.68s -> 6225.74s]  No one wanted to believe, believe they even existed. And when the truth finally dawned,
[6226.30s -> 6244.15s]  it dawned in fire. But one that in their tongue is Dovahkiin, Dragonborn.
[6245.99s -> 6252.41s]  What's happening to our city, Yuri? I don't know.
[6252.41s -> 6255.40s]  Feels like the end of the world. Maybe it is.
[6258.30s -> 6263.56s]  Peter Parker, how the hell are- Absolutely terrible.
[6263.56s -> 6268.44s]  The city is in danger. We need our help. All of our help.
[6268.44s -> 6275.00s]  Fuck you. Gang of costume nutjobs is taking the city apart piece by piece.
[6275.56s -> 6277.16s]  Eat your vegetables and fruits too.
[6280.60s -> 6287.90s]  This is opportunity knocking. You know the closer you get to them, the more you become a-
[6289.66s -> 6292.36s]  Closer I get, the better chance we have to stop them.
[6292.36s -> 6293.72s]  You're a scientist.
[6293.72s -> 6297.16s]  I've ordered Silver Sable and her team to shoot you on sight.
[6298.04s -> 6301.03s]  Hey, Yuri!
[6301.03s -> 6303.03s]  This city's had enough of your vigilante-
[6306.07s -> 6306.57s]  Cool.
[6313.46s -> 6325.10s]  I'm something of a scientist myself.
[6326.06s -> 6327.18s]  It's time for you to pay!
[6327.90s -> 6328.78s]  Oh my god.
[6334.01s -> 6347.34s]  So why do you question for a real honest me?
[6371.64s -> 6372.14s]  Yeah!
[6374.50s -> 6375.00s]  Yeah!
[6375.80s -> 6382.78s]  Mom, I see it!
[6385.52s -> 6386.16s]  I'm gonna die.
[6398.54s -> 6406.54s]  Me getting killed.
[6427.95s -> 6431.15s]  It's like not being that bad of a lightsaber, you die instantly.
[6431.71s -> 6433.23s]  You wouldn't even get out of the academy.
[6449.74s -> 6450.24s]  Oh no.
[6474.22s -> 6475.42s]  Shit screams hack.
[6475.42s -> 6475.92s]  Yeah!
[6519.79s -> 6520.75s]  Kingdom Hearts.
[6562.52s -> 6564.04s]  With the steering wheel.
[6581.34s -> 6581.84s]  Fire?
[6588.51s -> 6589.01s]  Water.
[6592.80s -> 6593.30s]  Fire.
[6597.21s -> 6600.41s]  Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
[6601.37s -> 6604.41s]  Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
[6636.17s -> 6638.65s]  What? What the fuck is that?
[6641.69s -> 6642.69s]  Great.
[6644.73s -> 6654.04s]  Oh, the emotes!
[6654.04s -> 6666.62s]  That's cool.
[6673.55s -> 6677.23s]  So, that was all QWO, by the way.
[6678.27s -> 6679.55s]  Until we just got to the next one here.
[6683.79s -> 6688.27s]  I'm trying not to just like be a cackling psycho over these, so muting sometimes.
[6690.78s -> 6691.50s]  Oh man.
[6692.14s -> 6693.74s]  I think we're getting close to the end though.
[6698.89s -> 6700.17s]  Don't mute. Don't mute.
[6700.17s -> 6701.37s]  Well, I haven't been muting that much.
[6704.14s -> 6709.00s]  But yeah, that was all QWO.
[6709.00s -> 6711.64s]  So, I think we only have maybe a handful more.
[6711.64s -> 6713.16s]  Like five or six more, maybe?
[6713.16s -> 6713.64s]  I'm not sure.
[6716.14s -> 6717.02s]  But here we go.
[6717.02s -> 6719.50s]  This is Ultra Compact Dream Streamer.
[6744.01s -> 6744.89s]  This is really good.
[6745.61s -> 6746.49s]  This is really good.
[6758.06s -> 6759.02s]  This is New York.
[6759.02s -> 6763.18s]  Peter in New York City, but 50% of its population is germos.
[6764.59s -> 6765.23s]  Oh god.
[6768.80s -> 6772.48s]  Peter, I hear you.
[6772.48s -> 6773.20s]  Why designs it?
[6774.00s -> 6775.20s]  Well, I have something in the socks.
[6780.08s -> 6783.10s]  I got it right there.
[6784.38s -> 6799.02s]  Crying.
[6821.76s -> 6822.26s]  Asshole.
[6827.63s -> 6828.35s]  My face!
[6830.40s -> 6831.76s]  Why are we all psychos?
[6831.76s -> 6836.48s]  Why are we all like fucking NPCs with like our aggression turned up to 100?
[6840.60s -> 6845.15s]  Oh, I need to see this one again.
[6846.11s -> 6849.07s]  Why? Like there's one of them hiding behind the taxi?
[6849.95s -> 6850.67s]  Holy shit.
[6850.67s -> 6851.63s]  That was fucking funny.
[6852.96s -> 6853.28s]  Again.
[6857.53s -> 6860.88s]  Peter, I hear you.
[6860.88s -> 6861.68s]  Why designs it?
[6862.48s -> 6863.68s]  Well, I have something in the socks.
[6869.15s -> 6871.55s]  I got it right there.
[6872.35s -> 6873.55s]  That's my guy right there.
[6874.35s -> 6874.85s]  Yeah.
[6886.12s -> 6887.80s]  We're all so like fucked up.
[6906.57s -> 6908.01s]  I didn't want to knock you up.
[6913.52s -> 6915.44s]  Why would they be in a fight?
[6915.44s -> 6916.64s]  There's no reason.
[6916.64s -> 6917.76s]  They didn't do anything.
[6931.34s -> 6931.84s]  Hold on.
[6942.80s -> 6944.08s]  Jesus Christ.
[6945.84s -> 6947.68s]  My fucking head is killing me right now.
[6948.24s -> 6948.64s]  Hold on.
[6949.92s -> 6950.80s]  Give me one second.
[6974.97s -> 6975.77s]  Okay.
[6975.77s -> 6976.17s]  I'm back.
[6978.09s -> 6978.81s]  Holy shit.
[6981.82s -> 6982.22s]  It's just...
[6985.58s -> 6986.30s]  This is perfect.
[6987.77s -> 6988.49s]  I think we're at the end.
[6991.12s -> 6992.32s]  Here comes the...
[6992.32s -> 6995.60s]  I think this is the last video on the list.
[6999.87s -> 7001.23s]  End of the movie night voice.
[7003.93s -> 7009.60s]  Oh, this is number 56 or 57, I think.
[7010.16s -> 7012.83s]  So here we go.
[7016.86s -> 7019.40s]  Happy eighth anniversary.
[7020.52s -> 7023.05s]  It's been eight years.
[7089.31s -> 7090.59s]  What Evo is that?
[7090.59s -> 7091.23s]  Oh, that's...
[7091.23s -> 7091.95s]  Is that Mars?
[7091.95s -> 7092.11s]  No.
[7102.52s -> 7118.30s]  Oh, look.
[7118.30s -> 7119.18s]  Viva Los Reyes.
[7133.48s -> 7136.27s]  Thank you for that.
[7136.27s -> 7136.99s]  Oh my god.
[7137.79s -> 7142.33s]  It's my pleasure.
[7142.33s -> 7145.28s]  It's been an eventful eight years.
[7149.18s -> 7152.51s]  And that is going to take us to the end.
[7153.07s -> 7156.28s]  We're getting a shitload of community subs are coming in.
[7157.50s -> 7158.86s]  Bingo Sunshine, thanks for five.
[7158.86s -> 7161.42s]  Great Canadian Frick Club, thanks for ten.
[7161.42s -> 7162.46s]  Gnarly, thanks for five.
[7165.61s -> 7166.81s]  Oh, man.
[7173.88s -> 7178.84s]  That was the encore presentation of green screen footage.
[7182.86s -> 7183.42s]  Oh, man.
[7184.92s -> 7186.04s]  I'm like a broken record now.
[7186.04s -> 7186.60s]  Oh, man.
[7186.60s -> 7187.32s]  Oh, jeez.
[7187.32s -> 7187.72s]  Oh, man.
[7189.05s -> 7191.77s]  My head is fucking flying around in circles right now.
[7195.02s -> 7197.77s]  Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs.
[7197.77s -> 7201.21s]  And yeah, it actually, like last week or something,
[7201.21s -> 7204.25s]  was eight years on Twitch and YouTube combined.
[7204.25s -> 7206.52s]  It's been a long time.
[7206.52s -> 7210.04s]  I want to just thank everybody for all the awesome shit that they made.
[7210.04s -> 7211.56s]  If your video didn't make it through,
[7211.56s -> 7213.76s]  that doesn't mean it wasn't any good.
[7213.76s -> 7216.72s]  I just wanted to condense this down to like a couple hours.
[7216.72s -> 7218.24s]  Like one to two hours.
[7221.64s -> 7225.08s]  So the playlist, I think, let me make sure there's that.
[7225.08s -> 7225.80s]  There might be one.
[7225.80s -> 7226.76s]  There might be another one.
[7226.76s -> 7227.64s]  Let me see.
[7227.64s -> 7232.64s]  Let's just check the playlist to see just in case something was added.
[7232.64s -> 7233.20s]  No, that's it.
[7235.55s -> 7236.75s]  So I got the playlist.
[7238.49s -> 7239.77s]  It will be publiced.
[7239.77s -> 7241.21s]  It's not going to be unlisted.
[7241.21s -> 7245.23s]  Grump is publishing this right now.
[7245.23s -> 7248.51s]  Here is the playlist if you'd like to watch everything that was there.
[7248.51s -> 7255.20s]  You guys surprise me every single day with your creativity
[7255.20s -> 7258.24s]  and how fucking funny and interesting the shit you put together is.
[7261.37s -> 7264.65s]  All I could do this stream is just enjoy it.
[7264.65s -> 7269.50s]  So thank you for all these awesome videos and thanks for participating.
[7269.50s -> 7271.02s]  Here is a link to the playlist.
[7274.25s -> 7277.55s]  That is the current playlist.
[7277.55s -> 7278.51s]  55 videos.
[7278.51s -> 7280.11s]  It's about an hour and 20 minutes.
[7280.11s -> 7281.47s]  Hour and 10 minutes or so.
[7287.56s -> 7292.09s]  So I am going to, I'm probably going to call it early
[7292.09s -> 7294.89s]  because I have seriously like slapped myself
[7294.89s -> 7299.77s]  into like an even worse headache than I had like an hour ago.
[7301.12s -> 7303.76s]  So I'm probably going to have to call it early.
[7303.76s -> 7308.72s]  But what's today?
[7308.72s -> 7312.22s]  Today is Saturday that I will see you guys.
[7314.12s -> 7315.32s]  Let me see here.
[7315.32s -> 7319.69s]  Today is Saturday.
[7320.57s -> 7322.17s]  I got some work to do on the carnival.
[7322.17s -> 7323.61s]  So I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[7323.61s -> 7324.41s]  We'll do Tuesday.
[7327.07s -> 7330.11s]  I am like, my like sensory overload here is
[7332.00s -> 7334.49s]  that last New York City one.
[7334.49s -> 7335.05s]  Holy shit.
[7335.05s -> 7337.85s]  I almost died.
[7337.85s -> 7338.25s]  The what?
[7338.25s -> 7341.60s]  Oh, if you don't know, I'll be talking about it a lot more
[7341.60s -> 7342.88s]  over the next few weeks.
[7342.88s -> 7346.17s]  But there's going to be a Twitch controlled robot carnival stream
[7346.17s -> 7349.87s]  that is going to be on the stream within the next couple of months.
[7349.87s -> 7352.27s]  And I kind of have to dial back streams to work on it.
[7352.27s -> 7355.82s]  So it should be a lot of fun.
[7355.82s -> 7357.40s]  So I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[7357.40s -> 7358.44s]  I'm going to just take a quick break.
[7358.44s -> 7361.16s]  I'm going to grab a water and we'll come back
[7361.16s -> 7363.16s]  and do the bits and the subs and everything.
[7363.16s -> 7367.39s]  But thank you so much for being part of this community.
[7367.39s -> 7371.47s]  And if you just watch, if you make this kind of shit, thank you.
[7371.47s -> 7372.67s]  I love every second of it.
[7372.67s -> 7376.96s]  So I will be right back.
[7376.96s -> 7380.33s]  I'm going to like throw some water in my face
[7380.33s -> 7383.21s]  and we'll continue for another like probably 20, 30 minutes.
[7383.21s -> 7491.90s]  I'll be right back.
[7491.90s -> 7493.66s]  Okay, I am back.
[7499.60s -> 7500.96s]  Let us get to the end here.
[7505.10s -> 7507.10s]  Stream is over.
[7507.10s -> 7508.54s]  Well, kind of.
[7508.54s -> 7511.18s]  Let's do the bits.
[7511.18s -> 7512.70s]  I also want to do the credits too.
[7513.87s -> 7516.03s]  We had a shitload of community subs tonight.
[7516.03s -> 7517.95s]  Oh, like so many.
[7517.95s -> 7519.55s]  Like more than at least a few hundred probably.
[7520.91s -> 7522.59s]  At least two to three hundred subs tonight.
[7522.59s -> 7528.27s]  So that's a fucking entire like baseball stadium full of people.
[7529.31s -> 7530.43s]  Well, I mean, not really.
[7530.99s -> 7532.99s]  If there was 200 people at a baseball game, it'd probably be.
[7534.03s -> 7534.51s]  Well, whatever.
[7534.51s -> 7535.79s]  It's our baseball stadium.
[7541.93s -> 7543.61s]  It's a little league stadium.
[7543.61s -> 7547.05s]  Yeah, 250 people showed up to a little league game.
[7547.69s -> 7548.01s]  Wow.
[7548.01s -> 7549.05s]  That's a, that's huge.
[7553.02s -> 7555.66s]  But thanks again, regardless, everybody.
[7555.66s -> 7556.54s]  All the community subs.
[7556.54s -> 7559.10s]  Let's go back to earlier today.
[7560.97s -> 7565.15s]  We had trust no one gave two dollars and fifty cents.
[7568.89s -> 7569.93s]  Awesome, awesome job.
[7569.93s -> 7570.49s]  Trust no one.
[7571.13s -> 7574.17s]  It was a hell of a job.
[7574.81s -> 7576.65s]  They say the movie night is finally over.
[7576.73s -> 7580.09s]  But my green screen videos playlist is not.
[7580.09s -> 7583.37s]  After a rich dinner, let's have some sweet desserts.
[7583.37s -> 7585.21s]  It will last less than 10 minutes.
[7585.21s -> 7585.85s]  Don't worry.
[7586.65s -> 7587.85s]  Love to you, dad.
[7587.85s -> 7588.57s]  Love to chat.
[7590.24s -> 7593.52s]  Green screen movie encore night desserts.
[7599.98s -> 7601.02s]  We got desserts.
[7607.05s -> 7608.65s]  Oh man, we've got some desserts.
[7612.20s -> 7612.52s]  Okay.
[7613.24s -> 7624.73s]  This is trust no one.
[7626.03s -> 7630.83s]  Made of that insanely awesome nine minute full short movie.
[7634.51s -> 7636.27s]  We're going to get the after credit scene here then.
[7640.89s -> 7641.29s]  Why not?
[7641.29s -> 7641.53s]  Right?
[7643.12s -> 7644.08s]  I'm going to get it on the screen.
[7646.14s -> 7646.94s]  Here are the desserts.
[7647.74s -> 7651.72s]  These are all by trust no one.
[7651.72s -> 7653.00s]  Less than 10 minutes or so here.
[7655.53s -> 7658.73s]  We will continue with the bits after this, but this is truly like me.
[7658.73s -> 7660.17s]  If we're here, let's do it.
[7660.81s -> 7671.58s]  I just need to make this bigger.
[7672.30s -> 7676.22s]  Here we go.
[7677.08s -> 7678.12s]  This is chat.
[7678.12s -> 7679.64s]  Jermis chat during a stream.
[7680.28s -> 7684.59s]  I will link this playlist as well.
[7702.86s -> 7704.46s]  These were the final levels.
[7708.11s -> 7708.59s]  Oh, what?
[7711.92s -> 7712.32s]  Good.
[7712.88s -> 7715.93s]  Kill him.
[7715.93s -> 7719.12s]  Kill him now.
[7719.12s -> 7722.30s]  What the fuck?
[7722.30s -> 7723.18s]  Do it.
[7723.18s -> 7735.00s]  Please welcome the guy who will finally be Team 71 on screen.
[7736.04s -> 7749.68s]  That's true.
[7749.68s -> 7750.72s]  Life is pain.
[7752.96s -> 7755.50s]  Jermis tie issue.
[7756.30s -> 7760.28s]  I don't fucking care about this tie.
[7761.08s -> 7776.78s]  You are Superman, aren't you?
[7776.78s -> 7778.14s]  And now you have to go fuck yourself.
[7780.76s -> 7782.04s]  Oh, my head.
[7822.52s -> 7822.84s]  Zap.
[7837.92s -> 7841.07s]  Wait, this is spoiler.
[7841.07s -> 7842.67s]  This is spoiler incoming.
[7843.23s -> 7845.56s]  This possible spoiler alert.
[7846.20s -> 7848.41s]  For I don't know what movie.
[7848.41s -> 7850.49s]  They've made like 16 of these.
[7850.49s -> 7852.48s]  I don't know which one.
[7852.48s -> 7853.52s]  Just be ready.
[7881.60s -> 7883.44s]  Bugs Bungie Special.
[7884.24s -> 7887.92s]  You really fucking watching this shit?
[7888.64s -> 7894.20s]  Oh, please.
[7895.90s -> 7897.26s]  Oh, my God.
[7906.91s -> 7907.47s]  Fuck you.
[7934.56s -> 7935.84s]  Wait, this is interview.
[7935.84s -> 7936.08s]  German.
[7936.80s -> 7939.76s]  German 2019 interviewing German 2017.
[7943.45s -> 7944.01s]  What is this?
[7951.90s -> 7952.38s]  Excuse me.
[7952.38s -> 7954.30s]  I'll excuse me like Walgreens.
[7954.30s -> 7958.03s]  Are you here for the interview?
[7958.03s -> 7958.83s]  No, just sit down.
[7958.83s -> 7959.31s]  Sit down.
[7959.31s -> 7959.87s]  Sit down.
[7959.87s -> 7960.75s]  Absolutely.
[7960.75s -> 7962.14s]  What's your name?
[7962.14s -> 7963.39s]  German 985.
[7964.11s -> 7965.55s]  Oh, I was looking at your resume.
[7966.11s -> 7967.47s]  I have a good resume.
[7968.11s -> 7970.03s]  It looks like you've got some.
[7970.03s -> 7971.79s]  Content creator on YouTube dot com
[7971.79s -> 7974.35s]  with over six, seven hundred thousand subscribers
[7974.35s -> 7976.19s]  and over a thousand videos made.
[7977.31s -> 7978.11s]  Unbelievable.
[7978.11s -> 7979.23s]  That's really, really great.
[7979.23s -> 7979.79s]  Well, you know.
[7981.32s -> 7981.72s]  Okay.
[7981.72s -> 7982.04s]  All right.
[7982.76s -> 7984.84s]  So what is it about this company
[7984.84s -> 7986.04s]  that you think that you can add,
[7987.08s -> 7989.47s]  you know, some worth to?
[7990.54s -> 7991.26s]  I can do this.
[7993.66s -> 7994.22s]  I can do this.
[7996.96s -> 7997.36s]  Do this.
[7998.00s -> 8007.28s]  Okay.
[8007.28s -> 8008.00s]  Okay.
[8008.00s -> 8009.28s]  Well, we're going to need a lot of that.
[8009.28s -> 8011.92s]  So it's really, really important that you understand.
[8013.13s -> 8015.61s]  I need valuable team members and.
[8015.61s -> 8016.89s]  Well, I can do this.
[8016.89s -> 8017.37s]  What's that?
[8017.93s -> 8019.13s]  I can count to ten.
[8023.12s -> 8025.12s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[8029.69s -> 8030.41s]  Okay.
[8030.41s -> 8032.97s]  Well, I don't think the position is for you.
[8032.97s -> 8034.81s]  The position already has been filled.
[8034.81s -> 8036.81s]  So what can you do?
[8037.85s -> 8039.21s]  Just so you know who you're dealing with.
[8045.39s -> 8046.91s]  Nobody used any of that.
[8048.24s -> 8050.88s]  That's the only one that used guy at desk.
[8051.84s -> 8052.80s]  Interviewing somebody.
[8057.87s -> 8062.27s]  I sat there in January 1st and I did like five of those.
[8066.72s -> 8068.32s]  This is back to formula.
[8068.32s -> 8085.77s]  Who is this?
[8086.57s -> 8087.05s]  Is this me?
[8090.25s -> 8107.96s]  This out.
[8107.96s -> 8110.60s]  Why don't you do the other filming for us while I run the brand?
[8111.32s -> 8112.36s]  I'm going to give you this camera.
[8112.36s -> 8113.16s]  But first, let me just say.
[8114.68s -> 8116.04s]  Number one, don't talk.
[8117.00s -> 8117.88s]  I'm getting the hang of it.
[8121.36s -> 8122.56s]  Like this guy sucks.
[8130.36s -> 8132.68s]  Hey, it's time to play Dark Souls Remastered.
[8133.16s -> 8133.96s]  What do you guys say?
[8134.52s -> 8135.16s]  You ready?
[8140.92s -> 8141.96s]  No, no, no, no.
[8142.84s -> 8143.64s]  Damn it.
[8143.64s -> 8144.12s]  There it is.
[8145.24s -> 8146.60s]  Oh, I'm fucking dead.
[8146.60s -> 8147.40s]  Oh, my God.
[8147.40s -> 8148.68s]  This guy is horrible.
[8154.86s -> 8158.11s]  What about peppers and cheese?
[8158.91s -> 8161.07s]  Is that going to work?
[8164.36s -> 8165.72s]  Absolutely terrible.
[8167.10s -> 8168.46s]  Nothing about this is good.
[8168.46s -> 8169.18s]  Not one thing.
[8170.41s -> 8171.45s]  God, I hate this.
[8171.45s -> 8172.33s]  I hate this.
[8172.33s -> 8173.05s]  This is terrible.
[8173.05s -> 8216.41s]  I'm going to beat this little shit.
[8217.05s -> 8218.49s]  Oh, fuck.
[8221.05s -> 8221.69s]  Now that's a.
[8223.44s -> 8224.88s]  Oh, oh, boy.
[8224.88s -> 8227.36s]  It is time to say those eight magic words.
[8227.92s -> 8234.11s]  I am not smarter than a fifth grader.
[8234.11s -> 8243.56s]  Hey, it's Jerma from Jerma.85 and you're watching.
[8261.64s -> 8267.79s]  Wait, is this a point that like my channel sucks?
[8268.35s -> 8274.75s]  Hi, squash.
[8275.31s -> 8275.71s]  Oh, hi.
[8277.24s -> 8278.04s]  What are you playing as?
[8278.68s -> 8279.72s]  I'm playing as.
[8279.72s -> 8280.36s]  What are you playing?
[8280.92s -> 8283.16s]  I'm going to be playing Team Fortress 2 as.
[8286.19s -> 8294.96s]  Oh, but I like that.
[8299.32s -> 8299.64s]  What?
[8312.17s -> 8312.89s]  I don't what?
[8313.53s -> 8323.69s]  Why do I have to delete system 32?
[8324.33s -> 8330.33s]  Well, that was trust no one's playlist of desserts.
[8331.05s -> 8333.18s]  Those are fucking great.
[8333.18s -> 8339.64s]  No, I know that that was a watcher watching me.
[8339.64s -> 8340.36s]  That was a chatter.
[8340.92s -> 8343.79s]  But like, I'm pretending to be that channel.
[8343.79s -> 8344.59s]  Like, why would I delete?
[8344.59s -> 8345.71s]  Why would I need to do that?
[8345.71s -> 8347.95s]  It's my motivation of being a chatter in the channel.
[8351.55s -> 8354.44s]  But let's go back to saying good night.
[8355.40s -> 8356.12s]  Trust no one.
[8356.12s -> 8357.88s]  Again, great shit.
[8357.88s -> 8358.28s]  Awesome.
[8360.03s -> 8361.07s]  You knocked it out of the park.
[8363.28s -> 8367.02s]  Oh, I feel like I've exhaled.
[8367.02s -> 8373.40s]  Like 30 to 40 times tonight.
[8380.56s -> 8382.00s]  I've done the get.
[8382.00s -> 8386.48s]  I've been seated for so long as a 75 year old man.
[8387.53s -> 8391.21s]  And that's the noise that you make when you get up after about an hour of sitting done.
[8392.97s -> 8396.64s]  Ah, that was fucking awesome.
[8397.36s -> 8402.04s]  But let's get back to the bits.
[8403.98s -> 8405.34s]  Good shit as always.
[8408.25s -> 8412.62s]  We also had too many community subs to even count.
[8413.18s -> 8414.43s]  Like I said earlier.
[8415.71s -> 8416.59s]  Thank you, everybody.
[8417.88s -> 8420.36s]  Marvash Magali, thanks for the 250.
[8420.36s -> 8423.56s]  I swear, Jeremy, if there's a single Jojo dance meme in the playlist,
[8423.56s -> 8425.56s]  I will unsub and sue you.
[8425.56s -> 8426.76s]  Also, can you show Otto?
[8427.40s -> 8428.60s]  Otto is currently downstairs.
[8431.71s -> 8434.67s]  But they're I'm sorry that you have to unsubscribe.
[8435.31s -> 8436.75s]  I'm really sorry about that.
[8436.75s -> 8439.87s]  But there was at least one Jojo dance clip.
[8447.69s -> 8449.61s]  Thank you, peaceful Haley for the 250.
[8450.41s -> 8453.77s]  Hey, Jeremy, I don't really watch your streams that much anymore.
[8453.77s -> 8454.73s]  I'm sorry.
[8454.73s -> 8456.97s]  I'd like to stop in from time to time to donate.
[8456.97s -> 8459.21s]  And finally, I got some voice over gigs.
[8459.85s -> 8463.13s]  It's nothing fancy just reading articles and something for e-learning.
[8463.13s -> 8465.37s]  But I'm so happy I finally got something.
[8465.37s -> 8467.37s]  And there's even more gigs to come.
[8467.45s -> 8468.73s]  Can't wait for whatever is in store.
[8469.61s -> 8471.85s]  Anyways, hope you enjoy playing this baby game.
[8471.85s -> 8473.05s]  Mario, is it not a baby game?
[8473.05s -> 8474.01s]  Is it a game for adults?
[8474.01s -> 8474.89s]  It's a game for an adult.
[8477.44s -> 8478.16s]  But that's good to hear.
[8478.16s -> 8478.48s]  Awesome.
[8481.26s -> 8482.06s]  Keep chipping at it.
[8482.62s -> 8485.72s]  Thank you so much for the 250s.
[8485.72s -> 8486.92s]  And I think thanks for stopping by.
[8487.64s -> 8493.50s]  Happy to have you whenever you end up dropping by to say hello.
[8494.59s -> 8495.23s]  And good luck.
[8495.79s -> 8497.24s]  Hopefully you get some more stuff going on.
[8501.55s -> 8503.87s]  Mr. Comcast gave $5 earlier.
[8503.87s -> 8505.63s]  Hey, Jeremy, John, Comcast here.
[8506.27s -> 8508.99s]  I've been sitting alone in my shitty ripoff version of the Batcave.
[8508.99s -> 8512.19s]  The calm cave, you know, because I'm rich.
[8512.91s -> 8514.67s]  But I've been very lonely without you.
[8514.67s -> 8515.63s]  Going away for a week.
[8515.63s -> 8516.35s]  Disgraceful.
[8516.91s -> 8520.99s]  Anyway, I filled that time with writing short stories about you.
[8521.87s -> 8523.68s]  I hope you enjoy.
[8530.11s -> 8531.79s]  This is like three pages long.
[8532.43s -> 8535.16s]  Yeah, I used to know German on 8-5.
[8535.16s -> 8537.32s]  We go way back further than I can remember.
[8537.32s -> 8540.76s]  Back in those days, he was a somewhat normal functioning member of society.
[8540.84s -> 8544.92s]  We'd hang around bingo halls, giving high fives to old ladies as they left.
[8544.92s -> 8547.88s]  We'd go to see movies and eat food at places that sell food.
[8547.88s -> 8550.28s]  Sometimes we'd even go and eat food at the movies.
[8550.28s -> 8551.96s]  Life was great, tranquil, perfect.
[8552.76s -> 8553.40s]  It didn't last.
[8553.40s -> 8554.60s]  Nothing good lasts forever.
[8556.04s -> 8558.28s]  I noticed the change somewhere around 2010.
[8559.48s -> 8562.33s]  Instead of hanging out, he'd want to stay in.
[8562.33s -> 8563.85s]  We grew distant around that time.
[8564.41s -> 8567.05s]  If I only knew back then what I know now,
[8567.05s -> 8570.41s]  I'd have to try harder to get him to talk to save him.
[8570.41s -> 8571.69s]  But I was foolish.
[8571.69s -> 8573.77s]  Hanging out with Jerma became stranger.
[8573.77s -> 8575.53s]  It started somewhat innocent.
[8575.53s -> 8578.41s]  He'd go up to people, put on dumb voices, say dumb things.
[8578.41s -> 8580.41s]  But that was mostly the extent of it.
[8580.41s -> 8582.01s]  It got worse as time went on, though.
[8582.01s -> 8585.85s]  He went from putting on voices to actually being the characters of the voices he did.
[8587.13s -> 8591.05s]  He'd hide in my closet, pretending to be a crazy old grandpa,
[8591.05s -> 8593.61s]  mocking me for being bad at Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
[8595.31s -> 8597.79s]  His words hurt, but not long after his fist did.
[8598.75s -> 8616.17s]  Thank you for the five dollars, Mr. Comcast,
[8616.17s -> 8621.13s]  and thanks for the story, this creative writing assignment that you've given yourself.
[8622.01s -> 8638.00s]  Okay, if you'd like to read more, you can read more at your own pace.
[8638.80s -> 8643.13s]  Did I cut off my own mic?
[8643.13s -> 8644.81s]  No, I cut off my own throat.
[8645.37s -> 8646.41s]  I mean, I cut off my own...
[8647.77s -> 8649.05s]  I silenced myself.
[8649.69s -> 8657.76s]  I stopped talking is what I...
[8665.05s -> 8668.01s]  Thank you, oh my god, Teyon, for the 250.
[8668.01s -> 8669.21s]  Great stream today, Jerma.
[8669.21s -> 8672.57s]  Can't wait for the 20-second Switch Block Blast stream tomorrow.
[8675.80s -> 8677.96s]  Fourth consecutive line, thanks for the five bucks.
[8677.96s -> 8680.52s]  It's okay, Jerma, you're the world record holder in our hearts.
[8681.40s -> 8682.44s]  Oh, hey, thank you.
[8684.14s -> 8684.62s]  Thank you.
[8685.34s -> 8689.69s]  That means a lot.
[8691.53s -> 8692.65s]  Sirok, thanks for the 250.
[8692.65s -> 8694.17s]  Hey, Jerma, it's me, your agent.
[8694.17s -> 8696.89s]  After that embarrassing series of losses for the world record,
[8696.89s -> 8698.25s]  you're done as a gamer.
[8698.25s -> 8700.65s]  But don't worry, I have another gig lined up for you.
[8700.65s -> 8703.21s]  They're in the Las Vegas area and they even have a website.
[8703.21s -> 8703.85s]  You can check it out.
[8704.81s -> 8705.85s]  Las Vegas...
[8705.85s -> 8707.05s]  I'm not even gonna read that out loud.
[8709.87s -> 8710.99s]  But thank you for the 250.
[8712.72s -> 8713.44s]  We appreciate it.
[8714.91s -> 8715.71s]  Thank you, Sirok.
[8717.90s -> 8720.78s]  Also, Drew Word, thanks for the three dollars and ten cents.
[8721.74s -> 8724.30s]  Nice driving world record in my book.
[8728.30s -> 8728.70s]  Thank you.
[8732.78s -> 8735.85s]  Thank you, Drew.
[8735.85s -> 8737.37s]  We also had...
[8737.37s -> 8742.01s]  Not that long ago, we had Twitch Chat Main gave five dollars.
[8742.81s -> 8746.25s]  Pogchamped all over my pants.
[8746.97s -> 8751.15s]  You shit your pants?
[8751.15s -> 8751.79s]  What's that mean?
[8752.51s -> 8757.80s]  But thank you.
[8758.44s -> 8761.24s]  I hope he cleaned up.
[8764.04s -> 8765.88s]  Seize of the Roman, thanks to the five dollars.
[8766.52s -> 8768.28s]  Any gifters in chat?
[8768.28s -> 8769.32s]  Any oil princes?
[8769.32s -> 8770.68s]  Any hedge fund managers?
[8771.24s -> 8772.36s]  Any tiger owners?
[8773.16s -> 8775.23s]  Any oil princes?
[8775.87s -> 8779.92s]  Oh, this is during the insane sub blast that we got.
[8780.96s -> 8781.84s]  Me, me, me.
[8782.72s -> 8790.22s]  Thank you to AveryDroppedDead for the ten dollars.
[8790.94s -> 8794.24s]  Drew, I've been watching you for years and I've finally been able to donate.
[8794.24s -> 8797.52s]  I know it's not much, but I just want to show support to my favorite streamer.
[8797.52s -> 8797.92s]  Thank you.
[8798.48s -> 8801.31s]  You got me out of a rough place a couple years ago in the laughs.
[8801.31s -> 8802.35s]  You gave me a priceless...
[8803.23s -> 8805.63s]  Thank you for being your wonderful self.
[8806.51s -> 8808.27s]  I love you and trans rights.
[8809.07s -> 8809.87s]  Transgender pride.
[8810.43s -> 8812.06s]  Thank you so much, Avery.
[8812.70s -> 8813.66s]  Thank you for ten bucks.
[8814.38s -> 8819.26s]  And I am more than happy to be your favorite streamer.
[8819.82s -> 8824.46s]  I...
[8825.34s -> 8827.66s]  PeacefulHaley just came in with five community subs right now.
[8833.55s -> 8838.64s]  Thank you, PeacefulHaley, on top of your donation from earlier.
[8838.64s -> 8839.12s]  Thanks a lot.
[8841.34s -> 8842.86s]  You're my favorite streamer.
[8844.67s -> 8845.63s]  Thanks, guys.
[8845.63s -> 8847.87s]  Hey, Drew, I'm a hedge fund manager here.
[8847.87s -> 8849.95s]  I'd like to donate a hundred thousand dollars to you,
[8849.95s -> 8852.35s]  but I can only do so if you give me your Twitch username and password
[8852.35s -> 8854.59s]  so I can deposit it in your account directly.
[8854.59s -> 8855.55s]  I await your response.
[8856.75s -> 8856.99s]  Oh.
[8857.71s -> 8858.19s]  Yeah, okay.
[8859.39s -> 8863.85s]  I mean, that makes sense because, I mean, how else would you be able to...
[8863.85s -> 8864.97s]  How much would you do that, right?
[8865.85s -> 8867.16s]  I think I get it.
[8867.72s -> 8872.43s]  Because that's like a large amount of money I get.
[8872.43s -> 8873.07s]  No, that makes sense.
[8875.29s -> 8877.93s]  My username is obviously German985.
[8877.93s -> 8879.29s]  That's my username is what it is.
[8880.83s -> 8895.00s]  And my password is 24.
[8895.00s -> 8897.40s]  So did my stream cut out?
[8897.40s -> 8898.44s]  I got a long password.
[8898.44s -> 8899.48s]  It's like 600 characters.
[8899.48s -> 8899.80s]  I did that.
[8899.80s -> 8900.44s]  I think I got it all.
[8901.96s -> 8903.58s]  What happened to the internet?
[8904.30s -> 8905.15s]  No, I'm here.
[8905.87s -> 8906.43s]  Did you get it?
[8907.23s -> 8914.72s]  Yeah, it's like a 600 character password.
[8915.28s -> 8916.24s]  I'll just, I'll send it to you.
[8919.39s -> 8919.95s]  Thanks though.
[8920.75s -> 8921.95s]  When should I expect the money?
[8932.14s -> 8936.06s]  Just German98524.
[8936.06s -> 8937.58s]  224.
[8938.46s -> 8940.38s]  German98524?
[8941.60s -> 8943.04s]  I can't believe it.
[8951.45s -> 8952.65s]  Hey, thank you too.
[8953.53s -> 8955.60s]  Honey chain for the three bucks.
[8955.60s -> 8956.72s]  German, you have beautiful hair.
[8956.72s -> 8957.20s]  Thank you.
[8957.20s -> 8958.40s]  I take very good care of it.
[8958.96s -> 8965.00s]  I wash it and I condition it and I comb it and I brush it
[8965.64s -> 8967.24s]  and I eat lots of vitamin E
[8967.24s -> 8970.68s]  and I eat lots of high fatty omega threes
[8970.68s -> 8971.88s]  to make sure it's luscious.
[8972.84s -> 8973.64s]  I take care of it.
[8974.28s -> 8975.40s]  I don't want to lose it.
[8975.40s -> 8984.33s]  But thank you for the three dollars.
[8986.14s -> 8987.50s]  Another hungry hedgehog.
[8987.50s -> 8988.38s]  Thanks for the three dollars.
[8988.38s -> 8990.22s]  I can't stress enough how much I needed this tonight.
[8990.22s -> 8990.54s]  Thanks.
[8991.18s -> 8995.95s]  I'm glad you enjoyed it because it's always a blast.
[8995.95s -> 8996.51s]  It's always awesome.
[8996.51s -> 8999.07s]  I just wanted to make sure, you know, months ago
[8999.07s -> 9000.27s]  when I talked about doing this,
[9003.92s -> 9005.60s]  I wanted to have like enough time to go by
[9006.24s -> 9008.80s]  because this kind of shit is really overstimulating.
[9010.57s -> 9015.40s]  So I don't usually like to do the same thing twice.
[9018.32s -> 9020.08s]  And if it's something that a lot of people really want
[9020.08s -> 9021.04s]  and enough time goes by,
[9021.04s -> 9022.40s]  then we can kind of do it again.
[9024.92s -> 9026.44s]  So definitely worth doing for sure.
[9027.16s -> 9029.96s]  Cyanide Zero coming in with 10 community subs.
[9029.96s -> 9030.76s]  Thank you Cyanide.
[9031.56s -> 9032.92s]  Lots of subs tonight.
[9032.92s -> 9034.44s]  Wait till you see the credits roll by.
[9038.49s -> 9039.45s]  It's like 300.
[9043.28s -> 9043.84s]  But thank you.
[9045.16s -> 9045.96s]  Really appreciate that.
[9048.20s -> 9048.84s]  There was so...
[9048.84s -> 9050.28s]  I think I missed community substitute
[9050.28s -> 9051.64s]  just because there was so many in a row.
[9052.28s -> 9055.48s]  But whoever you are, however much you gave.
[9057.21s -> 9057.93s]  Thanks.
[9057.93s -> 9058.25s]  Really.
[9063.47s -> 9064.35s]  Eee half note.
[9064.35s -> 9065.47s]  Thanks for the five dollars.
[9065.47s -> 9065.95s]  Feel better.
[9065.95s -> 9066.75s]  Thanks for the laughs.
[9067.85s -> 9068.57s]  Yeah, I'll be all right.
[9068.57s -> 9069.93s]  I just, I had a headache last night
[9070.57s -> 9071.77s]  and woke up with a migraine.
[9073.98s -> 9075.50s]  And I knew that this was going to happen tonight.
[9075.50s -> 9077.82s]  So I kind of was preparing for this to be a thing.
[9078.54s -> 9084.30s]  But for sure.
[9084.30s -> 9085.18s]  Yeah.
[9085.18s -> 9089.37s]  Also, I missed from earlier.
[9089.37s -> 9091.05s]  Never Trust a Purple gave 50 dollars.
[9093.37s -> 9094.57s]  Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[9094.57s -> 9096.57s]  There was a huge amount of big donations
[9096.57s -> 9097.93s]  that came in about 20 minutes ago.
[9102.51s -> 9104.19s]  But Never Trust a Purple gave 50 bucks.
[9104.19s -> 9105.71s]  Thank you so much, Purple.
[9105.71s -> 9107.39s]  Been here for longer than I can remember, man.
[9107.95s -> 9110.27s]  You've always had such a positive impact on my life
[9110.27s -> 9111.55s]  and so many others.
[9111.55s -> 9113.31s]  Eight years of laughs and positivity.
[9113.31s -> 9114.27s]  Keep it on, keep it on.
[9116.88s -> 9117.44s]  I'm gonna try.
[9119.37s -> 9121.21s]  There's lots of stuff that I still want to do
[9121.21s -> 9123.29s]  and I'm still trying to keep myself interested.
[9123.29s -> 9127.47s]  So we'll see at 10 years.
[9129.53s -> 9130.81s]  That's gonna be so weird.
[9137.53s -> 9141.84s]  10 straight years is coming up.
[9141.84s -> 9143.76s]  I mean, it's gonna take like two years to do it,
[9143.76s -> 9147.07s]  but still never thought I would be doing
[9147.07s -> 9148.03s]  something like this for that long.
[9149.00s -> 9150.12s]  So thank you guys.
[9150.12s -> 9150.84s]  Thanks for watching.
[9151.64s -> 9155.10s]  But thank you, Purple, for the 50 bucks.
[9155.10s -> 9156.78s]  Thank you, Snooze and Cofter, for the 250.
[9157.50s -> 9158.86s]  Wonderful second movie night.
[9158.86s -> 9161.02s]  Love the talent and creativity this community offers.
[9161.66s -> 9163.74s]  Even though it's a bunch of bad jokes sometimes.
[9164.30s -> 9165.26s]  I always think about all the things
[9165.26s -> 9166.78s]  I want to write in a bit message,
[9166.78s -> 9168.94s]  but I end up not saying or asking any of the things
[9168.94s -> 9169.58s]  I thought about.
[9170.22s -> 9173.74s]  Anyway, do you plan on playing viewer levels
[9173.74s -> 9175.10s]  in Mario Maker?
[9175.10s -> 9175.90s]  Because I made some.
[9176.54s -> 9183.47s]  Yes, I will actually do a proper Mario Maker stream.
[9184.57s -> 9185.93s]  I just wanted to give some time
[9185.93s -> 9188.81s]  a couple hours before the movie night.
[9189.53s -> 9191.87s]  So we will do one.
[9192.51s -> 9197.12s]  It'll be proper.
[9197.76s -> 9199.85s]  Hopefully he didn't burn out
[9199.85s -> 9201.13s]  by playing the expert levels.
[9201.13s -> 9202.01s]  No, no, I was just,
[9202.65s -> 9204.17s]  I was just tilting myself.
[9204.89s -> 9205.85s]  So don't worry.
[9206.65s -> 9208.01s]  We will return to Mario Maker 2.
[9209.66s -> 9210.78s]  Let's go, actually, let's think about,
[9210.78s -> 9211.74s]  let's think about next week here.
[9211.74s -> 9216.81s]  So Tuesday, I probably, you know what?
[9216.81s -> 9218.25s]  Tuesday is probably a good day to do it
[9218.25s -> 9219.85s]  because Wednesday and Thursday
[9220.49s -> 9222.09s]  I want to do Dark Souls Randomizer.
[9222.81s -> 9224.33s]  At least on Wednesday.
[9224.33s -> 9226.65s]  So Tuesday will be Mario Maker 2.
[9228.64s -> 9231.12s]  Actual online levels, viewer levels.
[9232.84s -> 9234.52s]  Wednesday will be Dark Souls Randomizer.
[9236.09s -> 9238.25s]  Thursday, depending on how much fun
[9238.25s -> 9240.09s]  I'm having in either one of those things,
[9240.81s -> 9243.37s]  we might return to Cook, Serve, Delicious,
[9244.01s -> 9245.61s]  or that item shop game.
[9246.57s -> 9248.97s]  That's kind of the plan
[9248.97s -> 9250.41s]  for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[9251.21s -> 9251.61s]  We'll see.
[9257.84s -> 9259.20s]  That item shop game.
[9259.20s -> 9260.80s]  Yeah, I don't, I can't say it.
[9260.80s -> 9264.36s]  It's like recetteer or something.
[9264.36s -> 9266.51s]  We'll see.
[9270.16s -> 9272.56s]  Thank you Cripple Crusader for the $5.
[9272.56s -> 9273.52s]  It's been eight years.
[9273.52s -> 9275.12s]  The time really flies when you're having fun.
[9275.68s -> 9277.12s]  You've helped me in more ways than you know.
[9277.12s -> 9278.40s]  Thanks for the years of content.
[9279.28s -> 9282.25s]  Thanks for the five bucks.
[9282.81s -> 9284.75s]  That is how you say it.
[9284.75s -> 9285.87s]  Oh, that's good.
[9285.87s -> 9288.35s]  I got it right.
[9290.51s -> 9291.47s]  Yeah, time does fly.
[9292.11s -> 9292.99s]  As I get older,
[9293.87s -> 9295.87s]  the clock seems to be in times two speed.
[9296.59s -> 9303.50s]  But I'm having a great time.
[9306.57s -> 9309.21s]  So cherish, I cherish every moment here.
[9311.53s -> 9315.53s]  Great Canadian Frick Club gave $100.
[9318.52s -> 9320.28s]  It was a ton of money dropped tonight.
[9321.95s -> 9324.43s]  100 bucks from Great Canadian Frick Club.
[9324.43s -> 9325.87s]  I did a big laugh tonight.
[9325.87s -> 9326.59s]  Thanks, Jerma.
[9334.01s -> 9337.45s]  Well, thank all the people that made the great videos that you watched.
[9338.09s -> 9343.16s]  Thanks to all of you.
[9345.55s -> 9347.23s]  Thank you for the 100 bucks.
[9349.95s -> 9351.55s]  DeusMorte, thanks for the $250.
[9351.55s -> 9352.75s]  I don't know who leaked this video,
[9352.75s -> 9354.43s]  but I'm looking forward to the Carnival stream.
[9354.43s -> 9355.55s]  Who leaked this video?
[9361.32s -> 9361.80s]  Leaked what?
[9369.64s -> 9371.32s]  Well, I mean, we kind of have to watch this.
[9404.56s -> 9405.92s]  It's going to be fucking crazy.
[9408.51s -> 9412.43s]  That much I can at least promise you is it's going to be wild.
[9412.43s -> 9416.30s]  Prepare yourself for that stream.
[9417.26s -> 9420.36s]  But thank you DeusMorte for the $250.
[9430.44s -> 9431.80s]  Chat's going to be impossible.
[9432.68s -> 9433.96s]  No, there's a lot.
[9434.52s -> 9436.27s]  There's a lot of stuff we can do.
[9443.71s -> 9450.09s]  But thank you DeusMorte.
[9450.09s -> 9452.97s]  Feroidian weapon, thanks for the 10 bucks, Feroidian.
[9453.61s -> 9456.19s]  Can't really think of anything I haven't said already.
[9456.91s -> 9458.11s]  Jerma Hart, love all that you do
[9458.11s -> 9459.79s]  and glad you could get some laughs tonight.
[9460.35s -> 9461.39s]  I got a lot of them.
[9463.96s -> 9466.44s]  At least 10 to 20 of those videos, at least,
[9467.08s -> 9470.04s]  had me absolutely rolling.
[9470.04s -> 9471.50s]  So it was great.
[9472.06s -> 9477.53s]  Thank you Feroidian weapon for the 10 bucks.
[9478.89s -> 9485.82s]  I also want to get the subs rolling here.
[9487.82s -> 9489.90s]  This is going to be crazy.
[9489.90s -> 9490.70s]  Watch this, ready?
[9491.42s -> 9493.88s]  Here are all the subs and resubs tonight.
[9494.52s -> 9497.07s]  Here it goes.
[9497.63s -> 9512.19s]  It's going to be 200 or so people, 300.
[9513.71s -> 9516.38s]  Much love to y'all.
[9516.38s -> 9519.44s]  Try reading the names for old times sake.
[9521.12s -> 9523.68s]  16824810765.
[9523.68s -> 9524.64s]  Nope, not going to happen.
[9524.64s -> 9533.23s]  What name is that?
[9543.92s -> 9546.96s]  But thank you to Razlik Corgan for the five dollars.
[9546.96s -> 9548.16s]  Thank you for the amazing eight years
[9548.16s -> 9549.36s]  of wonderful videos and stream.
[9551.36s -> 9552.48s]  Hope for many more to come.
[9552.48s -> 9552.96s]  Much love.
[9554.00s -> 9555.68s]  Thank you Razlik for your five dollars.
[9557.04s -> 9559.77s]  And the really nice, nice words.
[9560.33s -> 9562.75s]  Look at that image, what image.
[9563.39s -> 9569.18s]  That's scary.
[9572.22s -> 9573.50s]  That is a creepy face.
[9583.61s -> 9584.57s]  Jerma Grin.
[9586.80s -> 9588.08s]  That is a shit-eating grin.
[9599.07s -> 9600.19s]  Maybe we'll add it to the list.
[9604.22s -> 9605.74s]  Hey Tingy, thanks for the 250.
[9606.38s -> 9607.66s]  Streams like these are so much fun.
[9607.66s -> 9609.02s]  There are so many talented people in chat.
[9609.02s -> 9609.90s]  It's incredible.
[9609.90s -> 9610.86s]  Cheers to you, chat.
[9612.09s -> 9612.97s]  Cheers to chat.
[9615.10s -> 9615.82s]  Cheers to chat.
[9615.82s -> 9616.54s]  Cheers to everybody.
[9616.54s -> 9617.34s]  Cheers to the viewers.
[9617.34s -> 9618.46s]  Cheers to you.
[9619.90s -> 9624.86s]  That's right, you, for making this possible.
[9624.86s -> 9625.98s]  Never Trust a Purple.
[9625.98s -> 9627.34s]  15 more dollars.
[9627.34s -> 9628.06s]  Thank you, Purple.
[9629.98s -> 9631.42s]  Three years here with you, man.
[9631.42s -> 9632.22s]  Three years.
[9632.78s -> 9634.86s]  You've changed my life more than I could ever describe.
[9634.86s -> 9635.66s]  Three years.
[9635.66s -> 9636.62s]  I'll be here for 30.
[9637.50s -> 9638.56s]  Never stop.
[9638.56s -> 9641.76s]  Best content creator on the internet in modern history.
[9642.64s -> 9646.64s]  That's incredibly flattering that you think that
[9649.92s -> 9651.36s]  you've been around for a long time, Purple.
[9651.36s -> 9653.52s]  So thank you.
[9656.88s -> 9658.00s]  Let's keep going, right?
[9658.56s -> 9659.76s]  Let's keep trying new things.
[9660.40s -> 9663.44s]  A couple more.
[9663.44s -> 9665.76s]  Here we have Nickname Jack for the 250.
[9665.76s -> 9666.64s]  Amazing encore.
[9666.64s -> 9667.60s]  Thanks for the laughs tonight.
[9668.40s -> 9670.16s]  So many talents in chat.
[9670.16s -> 9670.64s]  Love you all.
[9677.24s -> 9678.76s]  Thank you, Nickname Jack.
[9681.88s -> 9682.68s]  Really appreciate it.
[9683.24s -> 9686.19s]  Thank you Sir Black Mage for the 250.
[9686.51s -> 9688.19s]  Jermbo, EU pleb here.
[9688.19s -> 9691.79s]  It's 4 a.m. in Austria and I'm falling asleep at my desk.
[9692.35s -> 9694.83s]  But it was worth staying up for this hysterical stream.
[9694.83s -> 9698.19s]  Also been watching you since 2004 or something.
[9700.99s -> 9703.82s]  That's a long fucking time.
[9707.02s -> 9708.86s]  Back in 20... 2004.
[9711.95s -> 9713.47s]  I don't think you noticed.
[9713.47s -> 9716.62s]  Well, however long...
[9716.62s -> 9717.50s]  That's a long time.
[9720.72s -> 9722.00s]  Back in 1985.
[9724.64s -> 9727.44s]  But hopefully you didn't have to stay up too late for this.
[9728.24s -> 9729.84s]  Sir Black Mage, thanks for the 250.
[9730.56s -> 9731.60s]  Glad you enjoyed it.
[9731.60s -> 9733.76s]  And thanks for watching for so damn long.
[9733.76s -> 9734.64s]  That's a long time.
[9737.47s -> 9737.87s]  Thank you.
[9738.43s -> 9744.92s]  And then at the very end here, Nico Cat gave 10 bucks right at the very end.
[9745.64s -> 9747.63s]  Hey Jerma, always enjoyed your stream.
[9747.63s -> 9750.03s]  You're one of the best most genuine streamers on the site.
[9750.03s -> 9751.31s]  Gotta ask though.
[9751.31s -> 9753.87s]  Did you ever think you'd play Cave Story on stream?
[9754.91s -> 9755.87s]  Interestingly enough.
[9755.87s -> 9756.67s]  First of all, thank you.
[9757.63s -> 9761.45s]  And secondly, I did.
[9762.73s -> 9768.01s]  Anyone remember the old YouTube streams from 2012?
[9768.01s -> 9768.81s]  2013?
[9769.69s -> 9773.07s]  I streamed Cave Story a few times.
[9778.36s -> 9780.60s]  Those old YouTube streams from 2004.
[9781.24s -> 9785.21s]  You did YouTube streams?
[9785.21s -> 9786.57s]  Yeah, I did YouTube streams.
[9787.90s -> 9789.90s]  But this is before YouTube gaming.
[9789.90s -> 9791.42s]  This is years before that.
[9793.53s -> 9793.93s]  YouTube...
[9793.93s -> 9798.65s]  Yeah, I streamed like Diablo 3 and a few other things.
[9798.65s -> 9799.37s]  10 million.
[9799.37s -> 9800.17s]  I remember those streams.
[9800.17s -> 9801.37s]  I remember my power going up.
[9802.09s -> 9806.25s]  I remember the lightning struck a mile away from my house and turned off like my entire
[9806.25s -> 9806.97s]  street's power.
[9807.85s -> 9815.80s]  I remember I didn't watch the TF2 streams because I was like gross live.
[9816.60s -> 9819.34s]  Well, streaming wasn't really that popular back then either.
[9820.22s -> 9826.16s]  Didn't really catch on until somewhere in 2013?
[9826.16s -> 9826.96s]  2012?
[9830.48s -> 9832.40s]  But that's my time.
[9832.40s -> 9833.52s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[9834.24s -> 9836.35s]  We will do some fun stuff.
[9837.71s -> 9839.47s]  Have a wonderful rest of your weekend.
[9839.47s -> 9841.07s]  Hope you enjoyed the encore.
[9841.07s -> 9844.51s]  Thank you again to all the incredibly talented fucking people that made great shit.
[9845.23s -> 9846.83s]  And thanks for sticking around and watching it.
[9847.55s -> 9851.93s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[9857.85s -> 9859.29s]  Good evening.
[9859.29s -> 9860.01s]  Good evening.
[9860.65s -> 9874.09s]  Why is my stuff broken?
[9876.22s -> 9883.31s]  Nova, we got talent.
[9883.31s -> 9884.03s]  What's Nova doing?
[9885.90s -> 9887.66s]  All right, Nova's playing Mario Maker 2.
[9889.96s -> 9890.52s]  Go see.
[9894.52s -> 9896.84s]  I want you guys to prepare for my stream for Mario Maker 2.
[9897.48s -> 9905.95s]  It's been a long time since we've said hello to James.
[9908.91s -> 9910.35s]  Like more than a few months.
[9911.07s -> 9916.16s]  And he's playing Mario Maker 2 so it's pretty relevant right now.
[9916.16s -> 9925.98s]  Go say hello.
[9938.06s -> 9939.18s]  What's our battle cry?
[9941.84s -> 9943.26s]  Um sup.
[9945.76s -> 9946.88s]  Say sup.
[9947.68s -> 9951.36s]  And I want you to pay attention to how good Nova is at this game
[9951.36s -> 9952.64s]  because you need to be ready to watch me.
[9954.92s -> 9956.68s]  He ain't going to get a world record on a speedrun.
[9957.32s -> 9960.12s]  Here we go.
[9960.12s -> 9973.12s]  Are we ready?
[9973.12s -> 9976.44s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[9976.44s -> 9976.84s]  Take care.
[9979.28s -> 10001.98s]  Much love to you.
