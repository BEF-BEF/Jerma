[5.05s -> 13.77s]  Oh, there's no sound. Oops. Hey. That was awkward. Hey, hi guys. Welcome to the stream.
[14.33s -> 23.88s]  You guys could just hear my mouth open. That's what it sounds like when there's no
[23.88s -> 41.61s]  background sounds or audio. This is what you hear. That's, no, like, you can't hear that now,
[41.61s -> 49.74s]  that this is on. Like, I just did it and you didn't hear it. Fucking magic of audio mixing.
[49.74s -> 52.86s]  Anyways, uh, how you guys doing? Hope you had a good couple of days there,
[52.86s -> 63.02s]  after the green screen movie night. Hope all is well. My camera's on. Oh, better turn it off.
[63.66s -> 71.82s]  Tonight we're gonna play Just Cause 4 and then tomorrow, uh, if it's allowed, we're going to
[71.82s -> 80.02s]  re-stream the game awards and, you know, maybe give a little j- couple of jabs every now and again.
[80.58s -> 93.93s]  And then after that, the plan is for, uh, potentially this weekend, Saturday and Sunday,
[93.93s -> 102.98s]  to be Dreamcast. I'm gonna get that ready to go if I can. So that is the plan for this week.
[103.54s -> 116.38s]  Okay, but what about Lego Island? All things, all things will happen eventually. It can't be
[116.38s -> 126.66s]  Lego Island every single stream, you know? I would love nothing more than to have it be Lego Island
[126.66s -> 134.28s]  every stream. But I'm sorry, guys. It's just not the way it works. So let's move over here.
[135.83s -> 142.31s]  Uh, Just Cause 4, it's just, I heard it was interesting. That's what I heard.
[143.35s -> 149.03s]  You know, might not be true. It's currently sitting at a very great, mostly negative on
[149.03s -> 161.06s]  Steam. I don't know why. But it is. And here it is right now. That's because it sucks.
[161.62s -> 179.82s]  All right, well, let's, well, just how much does it suck? Just Cause you can doesn't mean that you
[179.82s -> 191.54s]  should. But I mean, look, we have to try stuff. Okay? This stream is a fucking first impressions
[192.34s -> 195.94s]  journalistic approach to most video games, right? Like, we have to get, we have to do it.
[207.26s -> 208.30s]  Oh, the game is starting.
[208.54s -> 212.14s]  Up to this point, his whereabouts have been unknown since our withdrawal from Medici.
[212.14s -> 215.34s]  I thought that was actually responsible for deposing half a dozen heads of state.
[216.46s -> 219.42s]  The black hands have encountered them before. Anybody give a shit about any of this? Like,
[219.42s -> 225.10s]  I could just skip this whole thing, right? I'll give you our own backstory here. Okay. So
[225.10s -> 228.62s]  we fought him again in Medici where he overthrew Sebastiano Di Ravello,
[230.46s -> 234.54s]  real journalist. He had some involvement. This is his handler, Tom Sheldon.
[234.54s -> 243.27s]  Well, we can't skip it. There is no skipping it. We have to sit here.
[246.95s -> 252.95s]  So first impressions of that cut scene was, um, those animations in there. Hold on. This is so
[252.95s -> 261.00s]  loud. I actually just skipped that. But how am I supposed to know what happens in this one?
[261.72s -> 271.26s]  That's too loud. Yeah. You know, you got that right, chat. From my understanding, it's back
[271.26s -> 278.78s]  and forth here between two forces. Uh, one red, one blue. I'm going to monitor your progress from
[278.78s -> 287.30s]  a safety point. What kind of fucking system is this? Hold shift to aim down sights? What does run?
[290.70s -> 293.34s]  You get the grapple. Wait, the grapple is immediately in the game.
[296.81s -> 306.74s]  How do I suck to that? The road is walled off. Can you get over it? Come on. This is how the
[306.74s -> 318.41s]  rock used to get strong. Attach me to like four cars. What do I have to do? Okay. Where to now?
[318.41s -> 322.81s]  By the way, his new show. Those lights across the valley head towards them. Like here come the
[322.81s -> 330.09s]  Titans, whatever it's called. Jump off and pull the parachute. That's a big tower. Espinosa promises
[330.09s -> 337.05s]  it will change the world. No more tornadoes or hurricanes. And most of Solis believes him.
[337.77s -> 340.49s]  Project Diablo won't be a problem after today, Mira.
[341.69s -> 344.65s]  If your plan works. I don't want to fucking wait for this.
[349.03s -> 352.15s]  Reach the landing zone. What? Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up.
[353.59s -> 364.71s]  Just like in Mario when you're in Mario world. Wait, I lost the momentum. No, I didn't. I'm good.
[368.15s -> 377.26s]  I got it. Okay. I made it under the dish. That's what they wanted me. Face to face with a black hand.
[377.98s -> 384.30s]  We've come face to face before. Heading up. Okay. So I need to go follow the waypoint
[384.30s -> 389.56s]  to the outpost. Why do I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to do this?
[390.28s -> 395.64s]  Is this just cheating? I'm cheating in the game. I don't feel like I've been playing a video game.
[402.54s -> 409.34s]  All right. We're going up here now. I'm so tilted. Wait, why?
[410.06s -> 418.71s]  Does anybody else feel like they accidentally put me in a save file that was halfway through the game?
[418.71s -> 441.96s]  Are these bad guys? Okay. It's fucking easy. Yeah. God, I feel just like the Punisher in this game.
[453.43s -> 458.57s]  How do I, can I grab? Is there a grab button besides that?
[461.11s -> 469.42s]  So I gotta, I gotta get a juggle here, right? Oh, all right. So, uh, alternate fire, release all tethers.
[470.06s -> 478.44s]  Fire weapon, alternate fire, tap. Oh, well that's an explosive. Okay. This game sucks.
[480.18s -> 484.02s]  We haven't even gotten through the halfway into the game tutorial. Come on guys.
[484.90s -> 488.10s]  What's going to, this is what's going to, I know, listen to me. I know exactly what's going to happen
[488.10s -> 493.74s]  with this game. This is, we skipped the cut scene. We're in the middle of the game, right? It's going
[493.74s -> 498.14s]  to do this. This is like the, the flash forward. We're going to go back. We're going to have like
[498.14s -> 500.78s]  a melee weapon. We're going to have a baseball bat and like brass knuckles.
[502.47s -> 505.75s]  This is going to take us all the way back. We're playing a mission like in the future.
[512.28s -> 514.28s]  And I just took that out. That was so mean.
[516.76s -> 523.40s]  Put a reef on timer on the screen. Not good enough. Why would I do that? Okay. Grapple and open
[523.40s -> 537.59s]  parachute. You can fly around. I need to land there? Every bone in your body breaks right there.
[537.59s -> 549.74s]  All right. Made it to the giant speakers. I made it to my show. I can't just pull it out here.
[552.63s -> 557.03s]  It really is the fucking Mario reference I made. You guys all thought that was
[557.03s -> 577.69s]  nonsense. All right. Get up there. Okay. I've made it. All right. We're fine. We did it. Wait,
[577.69s -> 582.33s]  I was supposed to go up there and then jump. Okay. I know what I have to do. Bingo and then
[582.33s -> 590.46s]  fly over here. This is stupid. There we go. Just use the momentum of the ground.
[602.74s -> 604.18s]  Are you sure this isn't modded?
[610.34s -> 614.26s]  No guys, I'm sorry. I downloaded goofy gravity mod. That's my own fault.
[620.94s -> 623.74s]  Structure. I'll figure it out.
[629.53s -> 638.42s]  I don't even know what I'm doing. Was that a person? Oh, you can drive? This car,
[638.42s -> 656.36s]  this car still work? Can I grapple the car? Use nitrous. I've almost made it. Come on.
[671.26s -> 677.27s]  I feel like I'm playing Spider-Man. This is just the Spider-Man gameplay.
[678.07s -> 707.29s]  I don't have any grenades left. I don't even know if I'm progressing. Oh, shit.
[715.64s -> 729.46s]  He just turned into the cookie monster. It's all right. I'll get up. Oh, cookies.
[740.38s -> 746.10s]  Oh, I don't belong in this part of the game yet.
[746.98s -> 753.22s]  I'm at project the upper. This physics and the gravity just don't make any sense.
[754.74s -> 774.01s]  I'll figure it out. How do I get that? Oh, fuck. I have to fight. I mean, the conflict really is
[774.01s -> 798.28s]  just there. You know what I'm saying? It just is. There's too much going on right now. I need like
[798.28s -> 811.24s]  a slow beginning. We're never going to get out of the tutorial. We might not. I'm at project the upper.
[812.47s -> 820.55s]  Okay. There's a console up there. I'll figure it out. What? I just go to the structure, right?
[825.62s -> 835.82s]  What did I just do to that person? All right. I made it. Okay. That's what I had to do.
[837.50s -> 840.78s]  Could use this vent to get me up there. And then jump off the edge.
[841.66s -> 856.18s]  Go down and link the portal level. Come on. What the fuck are you doing, man? Why would I?
[868.04s -> 873.32s]  Get up there. Release the tethers. Get up here. And then I have to parachute because
[874.28s -> 880.89s]  I just did that shit. I just did that. You can't tell me I didn't. That's what I'm trying to do.
[893.58s -> 901.03s]  Oh, fuck. No, we're fine. All right. We're good. Melee attack is Q. Just for anyone that's curious.
[902.07s -> 907.46s]  This way we got to jump. Okay. This is just like Mario. Another Mario reference. This is
[907.46s -> 915.16s]  from Mario 64. That's all we do in this channel is make Mario references. Nothing else. We don't
[915.16s -> 931.82s]  ever do anything else. When you land. That went too far, man. Then get. All right. Reach the console.
[935.21s -> 948.71s]  I'm going to get behind cover. Is there a cover system? Look, it does explode.
[952.70s -> 963.61s]  All right. I got it. What did you say? What was that? All right. Shoot the explosives. That's
[963.61s -> 973.21s]  what I just did. See? Who just gave a hundred dollars? Lorag just gave a hundred bucks.
[974.01s -> 981.88s]  I don't have any more bullets left. What do you do if you don't have any more bullets?
[992.26s -> 1006.41s]  All right. Ammo. Get it. Shoot the giant exploding Disney balls. All right. I did it.
[1006.41s -> 1015.72s]  Anybody else? I think I'm safe. Hold on. Let me get to a safe place so I can talk about it. I
[1015.72s -> 1027.91s]  just got a hundred fucking dollars. Hold on. Up there. Watch this one. Can I get some pipe in the
[1027.91s -> 1042.10s]  chat, please? Wait, I'm on this. I'm on the structure. I think I got to get off. You know,
[1042.10s -> 1054.06s]  I always wondered why. Why do you have to ask for hype? All right. So we reached the console.
[1054.94s -> 1065.32s]  All right. Did I make it? No, it's over here. Okay. All right. Weapon case.
[1069.27s -> 1076.49s]  A grenade launcher. What should I do with this? Do buildings fall down?
[1076.49s -> 1090.23s]  I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going on. I have to hack this. Okay.
[1097.48s -> 1102.52s]  Oh no. Not one of these. Make sure I jump before shooting.
[1106.86s -> 1110.22s]  Now you're sure that I don't have mods and stuff. Are we sure about this?
[1114.14s -> 1120.46s]  I didn't get like the deluxe edition, right?
[1126.22s -> 1136.92s]  They're trying, lady. This person's freaking me out. Can I?
[1147.64s -> 1148.12s]  It worked.
[1157.78s -> 1162.90s]  All right. Remote hacking progress. Oh, they're on a stupid machine over there.
[1164.84s -> 1169.00s]  Take your time. Don't take your time. I severely... Whoa, that was a grenade launcher. I severely
[1169.00s -> 1182.33s]  overestimated how far that was going to go. Or underestimated. This is, um,
[1186.09s -> 1193.88s]  this is... I can't even tell you what I have to say. I did it. I made it. He's unlikely he has
[1193.88s -> 1200.23s]  survived this long. This is not an ordinary mine, Senor Espinosa. See, now we're going to go back
[1200.79s -> 1204.63s]  to like 1982 or something.
[1205.51s -> 1210.95s]  Let's see what Project Yappa can do, shall we? Uh, lower. Thanks for the hundred dollars,
[1210.95s -> 1214.07s]  by the way. I had a cold and wasn't feeling too great, then I watched the green screen movie
[1214.07s -> 1219.75s]  stream and I know only do I feel absurdly healthy. I can see perfectly at night and do long division
[1219.75s -> 1225.96s]  without a calculator. Thanks, Jeff. You're very welcome. You're incredibly welcome.
[1230.60s -> 1239.56s]  All artillery towers. PS2 cutscene. I'm getting, am I getting hit with the explosions?
[1243.11s -> 1256.63s]  So do I think it was? See. Deal with that, please. He looks like, uh, he looks like the mask and the
[1256.63s -> 1285.74s]  bad guy gets the mask on. What's that guy's name? What's that actor's name? Bogdano. Quick rundown,
[1285.74s -> 1302.76s]  quick rundown on the game? It's fucking stupid. Look, the ground, look at the ground is even
[1302.76s -> 1316.42s]  like moving around. That cement ain't fucking holding me. Please respond.
[1320.17s -> 1326.97s]  See, now I have to start from zero again. See, I told you guys.
[1326.97s -> 1332.17s]  Maybe a few reaps. I'll need to make repairs. You guys thought it was going to be a situation where
[1332.89s -> 1341.96s]  we weren't halfway through the game. I'm sending you my coordinates. Hope it works.
[1341.96s -> 1348.95s]  All right, so that's all we need to know. Skip this fucking whole thing. I'm stuck. Visible cursor.
[1348.95s -> 1355.30s]  Yeah, well that's okay. So all you need to know is. Not having my grappling hook is like missing a limb.
[1355.70s -> 1378.74s]  Okay, so now we have to go to meet Mira. Pigs. I can't do anything with the pigs. Why?
[1380.86s -> 1393.98s]  I can't ride the pig. This could have been a full letter grade. Okay, well, what the hell are you
[1393.98s -> 1413.51s]  talking about? Connect, is that, okay. What is that? Thanks for telling me. That looks like the place.
[1414.39s -> 1419.69s]  I'm no longer connected to the servers. I've never seen anything like Iapo before.
[1421.21s -> 1432.20s]  Mira might be right. All right, everyone's dressed like a Pokemon trainer.
[1434.47s -> 1451.13s]  Don't have your graphics on low. The graphics aren't on low. What are you talking about? Two double
[1451.21s -> 1458.25s]  anti-scopic filtering. 1080. Fixa. High, high, yes. Medium and medium.
[1466.18s -> 1470.02s]  What the hell is this thing? Is this like a bridge?
[1471.58s -> 1485.29s]  Okay. All right, let's go meet Mira. Zero percent. Zero percent what? What's on the phone?
[1486.01s -> 1495.91s]  What's up? I wanted to see the phone. All right, let's go.
[1496.79s -> 1505.83s]  Glowing hair. Oh, this whole game feels like it was made in second life.
[1509.22s -> 1512.42s]  Are you sure this isn't a modded version of the game? Are you certain of that?
[1524.98s -> 1525.54s]  That would hurt.
[1526.10s -> 1543.29s]  What happened? Everything okay? Yeah, fine. It's all over. Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just fine.
[1547.22s -> 1552.87s]  Things are going great over here. If you fall from that high and you land, you're going to disintegrate.
[1561.38s -> 1581.62s]  Just fine for, yep. I almost didn't make it again. Okay, easy now. Refund and get, yeah,
[1581.62s -> 1586.82s]  so this is second life. Where are the people with the elaborate like $400 animated dancing?
[1590.31s -> 1591.27s]  That's what I'm worried about.
[1596.15s -> 1602.87s]  Is that dog? That dog, that dog is very small. Doesn't look to undersize like it wasn't scaled
[1602.87s -> 1631.38s]  properly. Can you pick up dog? It's kind of leaning to the left here. It's leaning to the left.
[1632.66s -> 1638.38s]  I don't know. I don't think it's going to make it. I don't think this dog is going to make it.
[1640.86s -> 1658.76s]  Oh, well, okay. It's smart. No, maybe it's not. Come on over here. I got something to show you.
[1662.94s -> 1702.84s]  Let's find out just how smart you really are. Come on. Come on. Are you peeing over here?
[1715.61s -> 1717.85s]  That's really cute of you. Good job, dog.
[1718.57s -> 1726.62s]  Is there something else you want to do? You sure? No, all right, fine.
[1729.18s -> 1745.02s]  Well, you're very good at handstands. That's for sure. Oh, fuck. All right, meet Mira. The dog was
[1745.02s -> 1768.66s]  doing a dog T-pose. That is pretty accurate. Up here. All right, I'm going to bother. Here comes
[1768.66s -> 1791.70s]  cutscene in three, two, 30 FPS cutscene. Yes. You look awful. Yeah, so does this game. The black
[1791.70s -> 1798.33s]  hand are casing the village. Does that happen often? I'm being unfair. I think I'm being unfair.
[1798.33s -> 1800.57s]  It's only been like fucking 20 minutes. Maybe somebody attacked their weather base.
[1803.34s -> 1814.84s]  Tools? Jesus fucking Christ. You could just hand it to me. Why would you boot the toolbox over here?
[1815.40s -> 1818.68s]  I don't think I can take project the apple alone. We're in the same room. I agree.
[1819.56s -> 1829.96s]  I'm saying I was wrong. You were right. Is that a distress signal? I didn't think you were with
[1829.96s -> 1837.29s]  the agency anymore. Help me with this. Don't let him fool you. That's just an elaborate fucking
[1837.29s -> 1842.50s]  Yu-Gi-Oh toy. What do we do about Yappa? Between the blizzard and those artillery towers?
[1842.50s -> 1854.98s]  I can't get close. I have a couple of ideas. Tell me. Wait. Listen. What do we- a helicopter?
[1854.98s -> 1858.02s]  Your actions in the next few minutes may determine the fate of this community.
[1858.02s -> 1863.67s]  Choices matter? I am Commander Morales. I have tolerated El Abismo for years.
[1864.63s -> 1870.47s]  To maintain order and justice in Solis. This game is using the McDonald's happy meal engine.
[1870.47s -> 1875.51s]  For the criminal and the disenfranchised. That's what somebody just said. Last night a terrorist
[1875.51s -> 1881.35s]  attack was launched against the project Yappa facility. The culprit was abetted by a conspirator
[1881.35s -> 1888.15s]  from this village. Who is that? Gabriela. She killed my uncle when I was a girl. Is it my settings?
[1888.15s -> 1892.79s]  Maybe I should turn some settings to up or down or something. If Mira Morales is not surrendered
[1892.87s -> 1899.59s]  to me immediately, I'll be forced to conduct an exhaustive investigation. Every home will be
[1899.59s -> 1906.15s]  searched. Every citizen's identity will be checked. And all transgressions will be harshly prosecuted.
[1906.79s -> 1911.59s]  One guy had the gun to the left. You. You know what I mean? Like that guy's not in- that guy on the
[1911.59s -> 1916.95s]  right. See that? Everybody had that gun pointing down to our left. He had it pointed to our right.
[1917.59s -> 1921.03s]  Where is Mira? That's the fucking hitman right there. That's the guy that's in disguise.
[1921.83s -> 1924.73s]  I don't even need to look at the back of the box to find, uh,
[1925.69s -> 1939.14s]  Meryl's codec. I already know. Let him go, cousin. At least you aren't a coward.
[1940.49s -> 1944.41s]  Your father would be disgusted with the monster you've become.
[1944.41s -> 1947.61s]  All right, take the guns away and give him ski poles.
[1948.41s -> 1965.50s]  In prison. Why are they in this gear here? Wouldn't it be too hot to be in- that was a jump scare for
[1965.50s -> 1975.69s]  them. This is sad. Can we hit two likes? I freeze. Oh, here comes the first decision,
[1975.69s -> 1980.17s]  first quick time decision of the game. All right, well, I did- he just- he's dead. He shot- all
[1980.17s -> 2000.92s]  right, that's where he's at. So I'm the cause of this. All right, forget about Pokemon. What the
[2000.92s -> 2019.67s]  hell? I did that. Okay, I did that. I can't skip this cutscene, you know, we're too far into it.
[2020.31s -> 2020.81s]  We need re-
[2023.64s -> 2044.44s]  Get over here! Come here! I could have done that, right? You'd like pitch shift me like 5% and let
[2044.44s -> 2048.76s]  me fucking scream. I would be a great scorpion. You know, uh, if anyone's watching right now,
[2048.76s -> 2052.60s]  that's part of the scorpion dev team. I do consulting work, you know. I think we just
[2052.60s -> 2057.88s]  started a rebellion. We didn't have to drag these people into this. They are what we need to put
[2057.88s -> 2065.26s]  down, Project Yappa. Well, they'll need more guns. Eso. There's a factory down the road from here.
[2065.26s -> 2071.98s]  Abandoned. Cascillos vacios. Fix the graphics. You can't, what? Put every setting to low.
[2073.50s -> 2077.82s]  No, not yet. We can't give up yet. Anyone who wants to fight the Black Hand gets to fight.
[2078.79s -> 2087.03s]  Sure for it? I promise. Before the stream is over, we will do the Best Buy computer all the way to
[2087.03s -> 2106.87s]  the left on the shelf settings. I promise. I promise. Hope everything works. We've already
[2106.87s -> 2111.91s]  given up. What? What have I given up yet? We just got started. Look, I can like throw this over here.
[2112.55s -> 2120.28s]  He's fine. Just jump. See? See, look at this. I cars out. It already gets a letter grade.
[2121.16s -> 2125.32s]  Do you guys understand? There's a letter grade. Holy fuck. Why are you psycho?
[2126.12s -> 2135.74s]  What? What? Why is it? What's wrong with their car? Wait, what? Their car was just like eating
[2135.74s -> 2141.10s]  somebody. Their car was just chewing on someone. All right. Wingsuit. Oh, it's because I went over
[2141.10s -> 2154.41s]  here. God damn it. Hold on. He's fine. Just jump. You can't let me. But you just opened up cars.
[2156.73s -> 2163.70s]  Oh, bah. I can't do it yet. All right. Well, we have to wingsuit over here.
[2164.95s -> 2168.81s]  Hope everything works. Oh, battle bus.
[2197.66s -> 2200.66s]  All right. That's the factory. Oh,
[2206.25s -> 2211.77s]  when we drop right here. Oh, there's a guy at the cube. There's a guy at the cube.
[2211.85s -> 2215.21s]  That's what you've got. Your AR lens mirror told me already done.
[2220.50s -> 2231.86s]  Something like that. Let's get started. I feel like this shouldn't be happening.
[2237.88s -> 2243.88s]  Where am I getting the momentum to do this? Do you understand this is not physically fucking
[2243.88s -> 2262.58s]  possible? That's not how these work. That's the end.
[2262.58s -> 2296.41s]  I'm the hacker. That's what you've got.
[2299.77s -> 2304.81s]  You have an AR lens, like a little computer on your eyeball. Can I like shit something like
[2304.81s -> 2310.04s]  bird shit on people? Can I like throw rocks? You know what I meant by that. Can I like throw rocks
[2310.04s -> 2326.52s]  down at people? Okay, Sargento, you're up. Use the AR scan to find generators. The factory needs to
[2326.52s -> 2330.52s]  be powered on, but the doors to the electrical room are being held shut by backup generators.
[2330.52s -> 2333.80s]  How many times are you going to make the Fortnite joke? Will it be every time you jump from a
[2334.04s -> 2336.36s]  little bit? Or will it? Because that would be funny if you did that.
[2345.80s -> 2349.64s]  Okay, so we just gotta find the generators. Well, there's one over here. There's one over there.
[2351.54s -> 2354.58s]  This one was the closest one. What the fuck is that thing?
[2358.50s -> 2364.06s]  That's somebody's little toy helicopter. What? All right. Well, this one's over here. Let's go
[2364.06s -> 2377.38s]  this one first. One, two. I couldn't do it. I was going to do the Yahoo. So here's the generator
[2377.38s -> 2393.03s]  right here. I can't have this much power. I'm trying to do like this. All right, we're good.
[2393.03s -> 2401.19s]  Use AR scanner. Here's your mission. The factory needs to be powered on. The electrical room are
[2401.19s -> 2405.27s]  being held shut by backup generators. We shouldn't accept it.
[2424.30s -> 2436.84s]  I need to get on this guy's motorcycle. It's important. No, don't slow down. Oh shit,
[2436.84s -> 2453.05s]  I gotta turn around. No, before I lose. Okay, I gotta stop. Let's play.
[2460.47s -> 2464.31s]  Here's your mission. The factory needs to be powered on, but the doors to the electrical
[2464.31s -> 2471.64s]  room are being held shut by backup generators. Mission accepted, Sergeant. Your AR lens will
[2471.64s -> 2476.60s]  show you where to look. It's only a matter of time before Gabriela sends more black
[2476.76s -> 2486.70s]  to stop us. Oh my body. This game has got way better, by the way. All right, this is this one
[2486.70s -> 2493.40s]  right here. Use it to scan the building. There it is. Okay, there's a generator building.
[2495.40s -> 2502.49s]  Very good. Let's go over to it. Fuel barrels. Aim at the barrel and hold to start tether.
[2503.13s -> 2532.95s]  Oh, I can do that? Generators well shielded. Oh my god. Can you turn it off? To rip the plating
[2532.95s -> 2536.71s]  off. Oh, I can use my grappling hook, but I can't use a fucking rocket launcher.
[2540.86s -> 2552.49s]  Oh, I guess I shoot it in the guts. Build, build, build. One generator down. All right, I get it.
[2552.49s -> 2554.82s]  Okay, two more to go. You know where to look.
[2557.18s -> 2567.48s]  All right, so there's one over here. Am I gonna, am I gonna get minus for that one? Why?
[2568.52s -> 2575.48s]  Do you think that was fun? What's closer? 177 to 171. They're both right next to each other.
[2581.83s -> 2585.74s]  I won't do that again. I'm fine. Somebody's shooting.
[2586.14s -> 2611.03s]  What was that? Zip. Is he alive? Zip. What the fuck? What the fuck is that thing?
[2618.41s -> 2643.34s]  Why is this here? Wait. Okay. Okay, Sargento. You're up. Listo. Here's your mission. Wait,
[2643.34s -> 2646.78s]  hold on. What about the little school bus? But the doors to the electrical room are being held
[2646.78s -> 2651.74s]  shut by backup generators. Mission accepted. I gotta get on the battle bus. Hold on.
[2654.70s -> 2659.18s]  It's only a matter of time before Gabriela saves more black man to stop us.
[2659.18s -> 2661.74s]  All right, I'm gonna do this quick. We need to get these people guns fast.
[2664.01s -> 2673.03s]  There's one here. Just go. I know how to do this. Let's go to this one first.
[2677.24s -> 2688.26s]  Fuel barrels. That hurt. Really? Okay, pull this off. Generators well shielded. What the hell are
[2688.26s -> 2692.74s]  you doing? I think I can use my grappling hook to rip the plating off.
[2693.94s -> 2703.99s]  Destroy the generator. Good. One generator down. What's in here? What is that? Okay, two more to
[2703.99s -> 2708.90s]  go. What is this thing? You know where to look. Oh god, don't make me say like another Fortnite
[2708.90s -> 2726.22s]  reference. Another Fortnite gun. What? I don't know. Does this thing shoot blades? Toaster gun.
[2728.47s -> 2731.69s]  No, this is the halo promotion. Oh, the other one was right there.
[2740.39s -> 2755.14s]  Oh. And boink. No, hold it.
[2757.94s -> 2764.58s]  And let's use the Fortnite gun. Pretty good actually. I don't want to get rid of this.
[2764.58s -> 2772.06s]  I'll get rid of this stupid one. What do you got in this box? Oh, nice double Fortnite gun.
[2772.22s -> 2784.20s]  Oh, come on. Seriously, how am I alive? I don't know how I...
[2791.30s -> 2802.78s]  Helicopter? No, it didn't. Go for the brain. Got it. Got the brain. Shoot the fucking brain,
[2802.78s -> 2819.94s]  guys. Every time. All right, we're good. I think that's it. We have one more to do,
[2819.94s -> 2828.15s]  which is down here. Are we still alive in here? No, no one's alive in there. You're behind me.
[2829.03s -> 2843.37s]  That was so fucking loud. All right, let's go quickly. This thing is you get to skip so
[2843.37s -> 2848.09s]  much nonsense doing this. Okay, I'm gonna kill... I'm gonna die if I keep doing that. I keep thinking
[2848.09s -> 2861.83s]  I'm gonna... I keep hitting my fucking head on the wall. That's not good. Almost done. Here's the last
[2861.83s -> 2877.46s]  one. Generators are all off. Let's take this and I'm gonna replace this with this. Choppers and troops
[2877.46s -> 2882.02s]  headed this way. Choppers heading this way. I'll take him out with one hit. Oh, what about this
[2882.02s -> 2914.31s]  thing? Yep. Those are birds. All right. Where they at? Come on. All right, they're not coming.
[2914.31s -> 2946.87s]  Time to go. Really? Fuck. Don't do that! No! All right, I gotta slow down. Where is it?
[2959.32s -> 2965.96s]  No, that was just... Little Mikey got a fucking toy for Christmas and that just went into the
[2965.96s -> 2971.86s]  coffee table and broke. That's what that was. On the first day of Christmas day, really?
[2980.33s -> 2987.13s]  Oh, whoops. Sorry, guy. All right, let's go. I was laughing at the stream.
[2993.05s -> 2997.29s]  Controller aim. What are you talking about? I gotta flip the switch.
[3000.04s -> 3022.55s]  I'll put up the Ghostbusters ghost thing. All right, come on. How do I get rid of these?
[3023.75s -> 3046.92s]  Eventually, I'll get it. Yeah! Here's the other one. I swear to God, I'm never gonna be able to get over it.
[3049.93s -> 3056.31s]  Breakers are on. And the Black Hand are almost here. Just hit the master override.
[3063.82s -> 3067.02s]  I can't. I have to do it every time. It's too much fun.
[3070.36s -> 3078.76s]  We're in business. Let's call everyone in. Uh oh, I'm closed in. Just give the order. Open the map.
[3078.76s -> 3083.48s]  The front lines... The front line is represented by these lines on your map.
[3084.12s -> 3090.39s]  This is where the Army of Chaos is holding back the Black Hand. Okay. The Zykan represents a
[3090.39s -> 3099.82s]  deployed squad. Secure regions by advancing or deploying squads. Select the Wachikuni region.
[3100.38s -> 3109.27s]  The Wachikuni. Okay. Can I like move the map? I think I just put... I put one in the wrong place,
[3109.35s -> 3114.34s]  apparently. I want to move the map. Okay. Well.
[3117.62s -> 3131.78s]  Should I just hide in here? Is this my safe bunker here? 60 FPS in-game cutscene.
[3133.54s -> 3152.98s]  All right. Is that mine? How long was I in there for?
[3154.66s -> 3159.78s]  It's been a few days. There's a bunch of canned soup in there. I felt like I could just stay.
[3162.66s -> 3186.02s]  This reminds me of those Kingdom Hearts III cutscene trailers they were showing at E3.
[3196.26s -> 3205.77s]  Is that gun gonna be any good? Come on, man. You opened that skin in a basic crate.
[3207.21s -> 3225.51s]  Did you see my weapon skin? I bought it on the Steam store. What happened here? I thought that
[3225.51s -> 3230.76s]  was music playing for a second. I thought that was a big party going on over there and that was just
[3230.76s -> 3239.80s]  music. To advance your front line, you need new squads for your army. To inspire people to join
[3239.80s -> 3244.28s]  you, destroy black hand infrastructure and vehicles. This creates chaos. You can notify
[3244.28s -> 3263.16s]  when you have enough chaos to recruit new people into squads. I'm part of the party.
[3266.28s -> 3268.52s]  All right. We got coordinates. What is going on over here though?
[3269.24s -> 3276.14s]  I need to investigate. He's playing the music over here.
[3278.22s -> 3295.69s]  What weapon is this? That guy's getting lit up. Where are you going? Oh my god. Watch it. I'm
[3295.69s -> 3315.90s]  the leader. Don't shoot me. Oh my lord. This person is destroying the whole bunker. What? I
[3315.90s -> 3324.55s]  could fly this? Where the fuck did I go? I'm in space. I'm in space. It put me into space.
[3326.87s -> 3345.35s]  Oh no, it didn't. I'm underwater. What's this thing? The blade is still spinning. It's a rare
[3345.35s -> 3352.44s]  weapon down here. Look at it. Are they still shooting this thing in the fucking ground?
[3353.32s -> 3366.30s]  Is there another helicopter? I don't know what's over here. I'm fucking so confused.
[3366.94s -> 3381.67s]  I need to get over here. Okay, so this is an enemy outpost.
[3405.14s -> 3414.74s]  They just let me go on here. I'm making so much chaos though, guys. Uh-oh. Speaking of chaos,
[3418.97s -> 3435.85s]  they're using the laser gun to burn me. That guy sounded like he's in my bedroom. I gotta get out
[3435.85s -> 3442.58s]  of here. I gotta do like something. I gotta do like a mission or something. There's a whole new
[3442.58s -> 3461.35s]  game environment over here. Who did that? Who even did that? All right, let's go. Where's my
[3461.35s -> 3510.01s]  scanner? I did that. Hostile still active. Hold on. No, hold on. I gotta go to the mission marker.
[3512.47s -> 3518.79s]  Lower the settings. This looks too real. They're just gonna do this forever. It's never gonna end.
[3518.79s -> 3532.62s]  So, why would I even? Oh, you can. Okay, hold on. Oh, nice. I got the skin. That was a teammate.
[3534.22s -> 3560.26s]  Is it a washing machine? This really is fucking Fortnite. Are you fucking serious?
[3562.66s -> 3574.81s]  You idiot. Don't do it. Don't do it. I know you want to, but don't do it. I forgot even
[3574.81s -> 3579.54s]  what I'm supposed to be doing. All right, we need to go to the mission marker. Weapon crate.
[3580.18s -> 3588.55s]  Turn the graphics down. No, not yet. I'm not turning the graphics off yet. Okay, release all
[3588.55s -> 3602.60s]  tethers. Where is the mission? I just have to cause chaos for like a little while. It's a chaos meter
[3602.60s -> 3625.93s]  up the top, right? How do I get to the map? Okay, there's the chaos meter. This is too much happening.
[3626.73s -> 3645.08s]  All right, I'm gonna go over here. M is not bringing up the map. It's not M.
[3648.66s -> 3661.80s]  We both shot each other. I win. One? Why is the map one? Okay, so we got this one here.
[3662.36s -> 3668.86s]  Sargento says he's got a surprise. Go to the coordinates and see what's going on. All right,
[3669.58s -> 3685.32s]  that's it's S. It's right here. I made it. Stupid fucking wingsuit, man.
[3686.20s -> 3701.10s]  All right, we're good. Get off this. This is so stupid.
[3703.34s -> 3707.96s]  This would be a lot of fun though if this was real life. All right, there's the
[3707.96s -> 3717.02s]  where I gotta go. All right, let's wingsuit in. Nice and careful. Air brake is control.
[3721.29s -> 3741.13s]  Okay, that's how it works. I'm ready. It feels like GTA with cheats. Yeah, that's exactly what it
[3741.13s -> 3751.22s]  feels like. It feels like you shouldn't be able to do this. Load up the truck. We're leaving in 60
[3751.22s -> 3756.58s]  seconds. Did you organize the ambush? See, most of the stuff we recovered is standard black
[3756.58s -> 3764.95s]  ammunition. But I also found some of these. We're not sure what they do. We didn't want to mess with
[3765.11s -> 3766.07s]  this. It's very bright.
[3768.79s -> 3771.35s]  There's a bunch more left in the truck. Metal Gear Solid 5.
[3772.63s -> 3779.99s]  This could be useful. They won't have a screwdriver. Somebody's had one.
[3782.95s -> 3787.19s]  You have to make do with whatever you find. So we didn't metal gear solid 5 people.
[3790.31s -> 3797.43s]  You actually can. I mean, that's just like a straight one. They thought that was cool
[3797.43s -> 3801.11s]  from Metal Gear Solid. They were like, yeah, I guess we're going here too. Sounds like a fun
[3801.11s -> 3818.94s]  mechanic to put in our game. All right, here we go. Grapple onto the truck.
[3821.42s -> 3824.78s]  Who's coming? I'm not even on the truck right now. This didn't work.
[3826.74s -> 3830.95s]  That balloon thing is pretty cool, huh? I think it'll come in handy.
[3831.77s -> 3833.21s]  Where'd you learn to plan an ambush?
[3840.84s -> 3846.20s]  I want the cow. I want the cow over here. I don't care about the mission.
[3850.01s -> 3851.45s]  Oh yeah, just one.
[3851.45s -> 3863.83s]  All right, you're fine.
[3868.58s -> 3878.09s]  One, open grappling hook menu. One, three. Okay, air lifter. This is where you can edit your
[3878.09s -> 3883.83s]  grappling hook. Currently you have loadout A equipped. You can have multiple loadouts
[3883.83s -> 3892.10s]  you can edit independently. Okay, so currently you have loadout A selected. Switch to loadout B.
[3893.88s -> 3902.07s]  Edit the empty loadout. This is your loadout edit screen. Columns define what your button presses
[3902.07s -> 3909.21s]  do. The auto column will activate mods. I knew it. Automatically when the tether is deployed.
[3910.33s -> 3913.77s]  Actions on the tap and hold columns will only activate when you tap or hold F.
[3914.65s -> 3920.38s]  Oh, that was a huge amount of money that came in. You're right. Did we even address the last one?
[3920.38s -> 3930.20s]  We did, right? Okay, I'm just making sure like I didn't just fucking skip it like an idiot.
[3932.82s -> 3936.90s]  Add a medium force air lifter to the auto column. The air lifter will automatically deploy to be
[3936.90s -> 3951.21s]  left up to be medium. Okay, it's right click to go back. This is so odd. Now the air lifter is
[3951.21s -> 3974.74s]  equipped in this loadout. Use the air lifter to clear the road. Holy shit. Wait, what am I doing?
[3976.34s -> 3986.79s]  I can actually stand on this? Oops. That's bad. Okay, hold on. 200 fucking dollars just came in.
[3990.82s -> 4000.12s]  100 dollars from D three four D dead C four T. Who fucking died here?
[4002.20s -> 4028.38s]  Oops. That guy's alive. Aim at the wreck. Hold on. Okay, aim at the wreck. Who is doing this?
[4029.50s -> 4038.18s]  And release. Oh my god, people are giving so much money. Hold on. Give me a second. I need to I need
[4038.18s -> 4045.83s]  to address these. Dead C four T just gave 100 dollars. 100 fucking bucks. Who even is Jerma?
[4045.83s -> 4057.93s]  Also love the YouTube. YouTube. Thank you. That's me. I am currently Jerma. And I think I will be
[4057.93s -> 4063.53s]  for a while. I don't know if I'll have any plans on being anybody else. But thank you so much.
[4065.78s -> 4071.77s]  Dead C four T for the 100 fucking dollars. And then right after that, I'm pink gave 100 dollars
[4071.77s -> 4083.05s]  to 100. 100. No message. Just 100 bucks. 100 dollars. And then right after that, 50 dollars
[4083.77s -> 4088.68s]  from Juno. And they say there's a lovely Easter egg in this game with a link.
[4090.94s -> 4101.32s]  Is this a spoiler? I don't understand what it is. I don't know if that's like a spoiler.
[4101.32s -> 4109.75s]  Might be a spoiler. It's a gnome. No, it's not. Somebody just drew that on their map and pretended.
[4110.39s -> 4116.86s]  But thank you to all three you guys. That's a fucking lot of money.
[4116.86s -> 4120.46s]  That's like 300 bucks in fucking an hour. Not even. See, that's what I mean.
[4120.46s -> 4129.88s]  Stuff like that. All right. Now escort him to the extraction point. You think I'd make a good agent
[4129.88s -> 4135.40s]  like you? Let me get on here. Keep your eyes on the road, Sargento. What the fuck? Because I think I
[4135.40s -> 4142.18s]  could do it. I always wanted to do something important. He's complicated, Sargento. He put
[4142.58s -> 4155.06s]  cake topper on. All right. What do I need to do? Escort him? That's what I'm doing. See you later.
[4159.69s -> 4172.98s]  Why are you not driving? Maybe that's why. Extracted. Oh, that guy was an S-rank. Holy shit,
[4172.98s -> 4200.49s]  guys. What else? That it? Who's shooting at us? Where are you? What the fuck are you doing here,
[4200.49s -> 4212.86s]  man? What? How are you even holding on to this? I don't have any bullets left.
[4238.52s -> 4247.78s]  I attached it? I don't understand. That thing is so heavy. Thanks for spawning me in a great
[4247.78s -> 4266.81s]  place with no fucking ammo. Whatever. Fuck it. Okay. Start the tether. Let's go. Get it up.
[4267.91s -> 4279.91s]  What have I created? All right, we're good. Is that a grenade?
[4289.27s -> 4293.75s]  This is what works for me, Sargento. You'll find what works for you. Get out of here.
[4296.55s -> 4299.43s]  For now, just worry about getting us to the extraction point.
[4300.71s -> 4306.95s]  On the head. Perfect. All right, I get to have a different weapon. This is the only weapon I have.
[4312.18s -> 4320.97s]  I can't even do anything. I don't have any bullets in this gun. And I have no other weapon.
[4323.21s -> 4324.57s]  All right, here we go. Here it comes again.
[4327.37s -> 4331.29s]  This time, I gotta be at the different... Don't. Don't.
[4331.77s -> 4341.38s]  At Bravo Station. We talked about this. Okay, there it is. There it goes. Here comes a helicopter,
[4341.38s -> 4352.22s]  right? CC, we'll be waiting. Over and out. What the fuck are you doing? Wait, I have to... Wait,
[4352.22s -> 4361.32s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What the hell? How do I let go? I have to let go
[4361.32s -> 4372.97s]  of this. Just focus, Sargento. Drive. They're still coming. All right, I'm going, I'm going.
[4377.67s -> 4383.90s]  These people just don't give a fuck. At all. Look at how many people are here.
[4384.54s -> 4386.94s]  That guy on the motorcycle just definitely died.
[4394.44s -> 4402.68s]  I can't... They just have a balloon on their car. That doesn't do... That didn't do anything.
[4405.96s -> 4407.96s]  How have we not ran this guy over?
[4417.29s -> 4431.88s]  What am I doing on top of the car? Get out of here. Oh, shit. Give me this. No, get on it.
[4434.74s -> 4438.02s]  Oh, I don't know how to drive this. I don't know how to drive this going too fast.
[4440.76s -> 4444.55s]  All right, we're fine. Oh, fuck.
[4444.71s -> 4449.27s]  You work out those hiccups, Sargento, and you could be a real operations master for the army.
[4450.39s -> 4458.17s]  No, I can't. I gotta get out of here. I gotta go, gotta go. I'm almost there.
[4460.81s -> 4469.54s]  All right, don't run into them. Watch this. Ready? And somehow that does not kill them.
[4471.21s -> 4492.81s]  What? Go, go, go. Hide away. Inflate, inflate. All right, that's gonna take them away, right?
[4493.53s -> 4509.19s]  How heavy is this thing? You are so heavy. Grapple them to the ground.
[4518.47s -> 4531.05s]  They can't move. Oh, shit. Get the blimp. It's too far away, I think.
[4535.42s -> 4539.10s]  Oh, no, he's alive. He's fine.
[4548.63s -> 4552.71s]  Lock and load, people. The Black Hand want their supplies back. Everything's fine.
[4555.86s -> 4561.27s]  How do we stop this guy from doing this? I don't have any guns.
[4562.15s -> 4569.91s]  I need a gun. I need to get like a gun or something. Give me a gun. Give me a gun.
[4571.50s -> 4578.44s]  Where's that weapon? Is it a weapon box? Weapon box. Weapon box is everywhere, in every direction.
[4579.24s -> 4590.95s]  Who is that? Okay, we're good. It's a shotgun.
[4602.18s -> 4617.48s]  This is live. Oh, you guys are alive. These people are fucking insane. I'm in a multiplayer
[4617.48s -> 4637.54s]  GTA lobby right now. Come on, secondary fire. Don't ever blow it up. Helicopter. Where is it?
[4643.42s -> 4648.54s]  Down there. What is it carrying? Time until extraction.
[4658.52s -> 4661.56s]  I'll work behind the lines. Make sure the armies stay stocked and safe.
[4664.60s -> 4669.96s]  You need an army. You stick together. Am I this bad? Yeah. Hey, sure.
[4671.56s -> 4691.78s]  Why can I not hit this? Oh, wait. Holy fuck, thank god. Help Sargento train the army.
[4691.78s -> 4698.34s]  Search the map for training and counterintelligence operations. Help Sargento and the army of chaos
[4698.34s -> 4716.46s]  will earn mod points that can unlock airlifter mods. All right, I don't want the stupid sniper
[4716.46s -> 4736.44s]  rifle anymore. All right, let's go. Squads received. So this is Garland King's new star. American
[4736.44s -> 4741.88s]  filmmaker Garland King has an offer that can't be refused. Meet him, meet with her, and hear what
[4741.96s -> 4754.42s]  she has to say. Yeah, let's do that. Close notifications. Oh, this is like the friends list.
[4756.65s -> 4764.66s]  One, two, three bullshit. What the hell? Make it M, man. Who's lost the target?
[4766.47s -> 4776.41s]  All right, we gotta go to G. I have a stun grenade. So we have to get from here over to there
[4776.49s -> 4781.21s]  in one jump. One, two, three.
[4797.85s -> 4804.81s]  Almost there. What the fuck was that? That just exploded.
[4811.11s -> 4813.19s]  Open the self-reeducation center.
[4813.75s -> 4815.43s]  There should be a control panel you can use.
[4817.35s -> 4821.46s]  I'm never gonna get that. No, I want to do the G. I had G.
[4825.59s -> 4852.34s]  Whatever. I'll just do this one. Open the south center. Fire stun grenade.
[4858.68s -> 4868.07s]  So satisfying. Is he stunned? What the hell was that? Oh, it's a grenade launcher.
[4868.95s -> 4889.14s]  I didn't kill anyone. Not one fucking person died. Not one person died. I find that hard
[4889.14s -> 4913.30s]  to believe. Weapon. Can create? No. What the? What was that? Who are these people?
[4914.98s -> 4919.38s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. These are okay. The army of chaos is breaking you free,
[4919.38s -> 4920.58s]  but we'll have to fight our way out.
[4920.58s -> 4935.37s]  I don't. Just let him go for a fly.
[4941.30s -> 4954.82s]  Drop his gun. What an idiot. What an idiot. He let go of the gun. Ow. Oh, fuck. He's gonna kill me.
[4972.07s -> 4993.96s]  All right. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Nice. Did you see that? Somebody saw that. You guys saw that,
[4993.96s -> 4999.70s]  right? Did my computer turn off? Or did you see it? I got a rifle now.
[5023.35s -> 5027.72s]  I've got a group to the entrance. Send someone to extract him.
[5029.64s -> 5044.31s]  Extraction inbound. Objective locked. What? Thanks, Jerm. Very cool. You are so welcome,
[5044.31s -> 5049.72s]  man. You're so gosh darn welcome. All right. Now take it back to the instruction point.
[5051.38s -> 5055.45s]  That's not the right way. Back it up. Can I get in the car with you?
[5058.74s -> 5069.11s]  Oh, I'm the leader of your crew. Get out of the fucking car.
[5071.48s -> 5081.50s]  Like, let me drive. Why would you turn this music on?
[5100.22s -> 5110.49s]  I'm what? Is this a radio station that's playing right now? This guy's gonna have a really bad day.
[5116.23s -> 5130.36s]  Why would you turn into me? All right. Let me drive. Get out of the way.
[5140.87s -> 5161.61s]  How do I turn the fucking radio off? Thank God. I don't understand music, man. Let me complain
[5161.61s -> 5167.77s]  about something. What is with music now? Where the whole song is just I'm building up a fucking
[5167.77s -> 5171.61s]  power level. That's the whole it's just like, here we go. Here we go. It's getting a little
[5171.61s -> 5175.13s]  bit bigger. It's getting stronger. Here we go. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.
[5175.13s -> 5178.49s]  This is the sound. This is the sound. Here it comes. Here it comes. That's every song.
[5187.34s -> 5189.34s]  How many songs does it have to come out that are just
[5217.59s -> 5221.67s]  he's an out of touch mover? No, it's just everybody's everybody builds music.
[5222.71s -> 5226.07s]  Instead of making a song, they build up to a song and then the song ends.
[5238.81s -> 5242.89s]  All right, people. It's time to free yourselves. Come on. I can't. How am I going to get them?
[5244.57s -> 5250.26s]  We owe you so much. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Let's listen to it.
[5257.50s -> 5258.94s]  Isn't it amazing that we are using?
[5259.02s -> 5288.58s]  Instead of. Well, you know what I mean, though? It's you know what I mean.
[5311.05s -> 5319.58s]  No, no, no, no. I'm trying to get the helicopter over here.
[5324.17s -> 5338.17s]  It worked. It worked. Make sure he's dead. All right. Let's go. Where are my friends?
[5338.81s -> 5352.12s]  Forgetting this is not a shotgun. Who? What is it? There's a person right here.
[5357.46s -> 5362.57s]  All right, let's do it. OK. Can I see a little bit of hype in the chat?
[5383.50s -> 5406.65s]  I'll take this. All right, we get it. No, we didn't cover their escape. Oh, look at that. Hold on.
[5407.29s -> 5415.22s]  I got it. I got to turn on the fucking music. This doesn't have a radio. OK, that's fun. That's fun.
[5415.22s -> 5435.21s]  That was a fucking bit of Legos, apparently. Push it over. Ideas. What do we do?
[5453.77s -> 5460.17s]  I was hoping I could see if we could fall this way. Crush everyone. Yell about.
[5471.96s -> 5473.08s]  Now we're going to go like this.
[5475.08s -> 5480.65s]  Come on, use a grapple and pull the bridge down.
[5504.25s -> 5504.65s]  Nice.
[5512.09s -> 5512.81s]  Bridge is open.
[5517.59s -> 5524.30s]  Imagine how sick this would make you.
[5524.30s -> 5549.67s]  You didn't do that. All right, we're going to we're going to go on the tractor.
[5550.23s -> 5557.53s]  Can I fit everybody in the in the tractor here? This is just got to fall out of grade, by the way.
[5568.79s -> 5569.83s]  How do I pick somebody up?
[5581.22s -> 5581.86s]  Wait, hold on.
[5581.86s -> 5602.09s]  Oh, no. Battle bots. God damn it.
[5605.61s -> 5613.45s]  Oh, thank God it started to be over here. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[5613.45s -> 5635.96s]  Here we go. Thank God I can do it again. What? Really? I can't pick them up?
[5658.87s -> 5666.31s]  It's just toys. It really is. They just it's just bouncing toys. Just Cause 2 was the same way,
[5666.31s -> 5676.94s]  man. It was just fucking toys. Where is everybody? Toy Chest 2. What are you shooting at? I don't
[5676.94s -> 5685.54s]  even know. Fine. Take them down. Blow them up. Whatever. Who cares? Nothing even matters.
[5686.18s -> 5688.50s]  All right, I can put my face in this.
[5688.50s -> 5703.83s]  What? What?
[5712.26s -> 5727.27s]  Get out of here. Weapon chest. Oh, long scope. All right. Destroy the infrastructure. There's one
[5727.27s -> 5733.74s]  more. Where is it? Up there. Oh, this is going to be an epic moment.
[5733.74s -> 5781.86s]  No, I didn't get it. Okay, let's get out of here. Not even fucking close. All right,
[5781.86s -> 5793.83s]  cover the escape. All right, you're good. I got all three of us, right?
[5795.19s -> 5798.47s]  It's like I got hit in the face with an explosion. I think we lost one.
[5801.53s -> 5807.74s]  Lower the bridge. Who is dropping grenades on us? Where are these coming from? Who the
[5807.74s -> 5811.35s]  fuck is throwing these? They're disappearing out of the sky.
[5817.58s -> 5828.18s]  Where is he? Where is he? Is he on the boat? His face is fucking up the direction.
[5828.18s -> 5850.20s]  He comes down. All right, here we go. Okay, one of these guys, I'm going to turn on the fucking
[5850.20s -> 5876.10s]  jacks here, guys. Sorry. I had to turn it on for a minute. He's on my ammo, but I would have jacked
[5876.10s -> 5884.92s]  him. Oh no, you're going to die. I need something. How much health do you have? Stay okay. No,
[5884.92s -> 5887.24s]  no, no. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. No, no, no. Get out of the way. Out of the way.
[5888.28s -> 5911.62s]  You idiot. You're almost out. Who's left? I got to make sure at least one guy gets out.
[5927.10s -> 5940.63s]  Why are you walking up there? What are you doing? At least get in the car, dude. Get in the car. Can
[5940.63s -> 5956.07s]  you get in the car? Get in. That's the last group, Sargento.
[5966.01s -> 5976.34s]  He did it. That's the idea. Good work, people. We got one person. All right, so now we can open
[5976.34s -> 5980.82s]  the map and we were doing what was the mission we were doing. What the hell? We were doing
[5980.82s -> 5985.46s]  something. By clearing 1A extraction, you made it safe for the army to advance and secure the
[5985.46s -> 5991.88s]  Tierra del Cuapec region. And by causing chaos, you earned more squads which are now awaiting
[5991.88s -> 5999.86s]  your orders in the reserves. Ready to secure. This number indicates how many squads you need
[5999.86s -> 6006.73s]  from your reserves to secure the area. One. Two. Lower this cost by securing adjacent regions
[6006.73s -> 6010.09s]  and advancing already deployed squads instead of deploying new ones from your reserves.
[6011.34s -> 6018.07s]  Okay, let's get it. I win. This is what I was trying to do in the first place, but what is this?
[6018.55s -> 6023.54s]  The army of chaos is getting ready to retrieve intel from a black hand radar outpost, but before
[6023.54s -> 6035.94s]  they move, Amira needs a favor. All right, hold on a second here. Unlock mods. Gas. Choose different
[6035.94s -> 6042.30s]  gases for explosive effects. Helium, explosive, hydrogen. So I can make a balloon and explode it.
[6043.45s -> 6048.49s]  Fragile. Change the armor used on the airlifter. Fragile, invulnerable player, invulnerable enemies.
[6048.49s -> 6062.87s]  Okay. Float. Change how the airlifter moves. Float. Guided follow. Peak altitude. Change the
[6062.87s -> 6074.73s]  maximum altitude of the airlifter. Holy shit. I don't even need to see the other ones. Set what
[6074.73s -> 6082.79s]  the lifter will do at its peak altitude. You can hover it or pop. Okay, well, let's try this. Gas,
[6082.79s -> 6089.94s]  gas. Step on the gas. We got something new over here. Splash damage. Oh man. Oh, I only got one
[6089.94s -> 6122.84s]  kill. Let's go. Your support is on route. What happened? Did I, what did I do? Um, okay.
[6129.78s -> 6135.29s]  Got him. You actually made it over there? How the fuck did you do that, man?
[6136.09s -> 6157.14s]  I don't believe it. How many of these balloons is it going to take? It's pulling in every direction.
[6161.42s -> 6169.43s]  You're still fine up there. How is that even possible? Still just floating around.
[6170.07s -> 6182.90s]  Get over there. Still hasn't crashed. All right, it's my turn. I want to see how hard this is.
[6183.70s -> 6188.68s]  It's not even fucking hard. You're overreacting.
[6194.82s -> 6203.46s]  All right, where am I going? All right, get rid of the tethers. I just have a helicopter. All right,
[6203.46s -> 6209.74s]  so I can fire a missile or switch vehicle position. All right, I have 91 missiles.
[6210.38s -> 6213.45s]  I should probably call this chaos, right?
[6224.70s -> 6231.98s]  Why did that hurt me? You understand? I shot that thing and it blew me up. What's this fucking
[6231.98s -> 6248.38s]  thorns damage? I was supposed to do that. All right, cool. Somebody's got on a SAM site, aren't they?
[6249.34s -> 6256.12s]  Where?
[6258.52s -> 6260.12s]  Holy fuck.
[6278.26s -> 6296.60s]  Well, I just was playing around. All right, where am I going? Here, right here. Track it. Right here.
[6296.60s -> 6321.35s]  Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.
[6329.51s -> 6335.27s]  If you're sitting down, get up. Dance now. Unless you're driving. In that case, just move your head.
[6363.43s -> 6365.75s]  Oh, sorry, cow.
[6370.09s -> 6394.47s]  I'm a monster. I'm not. I don't even know how I hit my head on the ground. That didn't make any
[6394.47s -> 6405.21s]  sense. Action. Action. Okay, start it. Just seems to happen every single time. You're right.
[6407.05s -> 6410.49s]  Hey, go sober up, Charlie. Get him working on some new pages with the frogs.
[6412.15s -> 6418.39s]  Hey, look at you, you handsome devil. Garland King, you've heard of me. No, but I've heard you can
[6418.39s -> 6425.27s]  help the army of chaos. Let's not worry about that now. Come on, walk with me. Rico. I love everything
[6425.27s -> 6433.35s]  about you, man. The look, the swagger, the leather. You're an artist. The Da Vinci of violence,
[6434.07s -> 6438.63s]  which is why I need you for this picture. I get to be in the movie. We'll work out the details.
[6438.63s -> 6441.83s]  This seems like it's going to be kind of fun. You see that barely floating rust bucket there?
[6441.83s -> 6447.11s]  See, I need it to careen through the water. My stuntmen bless their square jaws. They can take
[6447.11s -> 6454.23s]  a left hook, but they lack the touch of a true artiste. So here you take these and I want you.
[6455.35s -> 6460.39s]  Details. Just plant them on the rust bucket and blow it up, baby. Straight to the great dry dock
[6460.39s -> 6470.66s]  in the sky. Turn off motion blur? I don't think you can. Are you in? I suppose I could. Perfect.
[6470.66s -> 6475.06s]  We'll get your agent a copy of the contract. You don't have an agent. We'll get you an agent.
[6475.70s -> 6481.62s]  We're going to do amazing things together, doll. Okay. Hey, Charlie, fuck your story, all right?
[6481.62s -> 6488.94s]  Whoa. All right, I'm ready. I'll try to turn it off in this setting. Let's go to settings. I
[6488.94s -> 6493.80s]  thought I didn't see it there. Army of Chaos pilots. We'll pick... that was not long enough.
[6493.80s -> 6522.10s]  All right, so hold on. Let me hold on a second here. Edge fade. Is that doing it? That looks awful.
[6524.98s -> 6544.26s]  That looks three times worse. Put it on low? What if I do this?
[6544.50s -> 6564.54s]  Why is it always... all of it looks bad. Hold on. Global... maybe it's a global illumination.
[6565.10s -> 6573.72s]  I don't think it's that. Because everything looks just so ugly. Oh, whatever. All right,
[6573.72s -> 6583.59s]  grappling hook menu. Uh-huh. You now have a new loadout. Select loadout number C. Edit the loadout.
[6584.66s -> 6590.30s]  Add boosters to the tap column so that it activates when tapping F. Equip a booster with
[6590.30s -> 6603.24s]  high boost force. Tap here. Okay. Okay, we're looking for high force. Now the booster is
[6603.24s -> 6612.31s]  equipped. He's not reading our suggestions. What are you talking about? Shadow and motion blur is
[6612.31s -> 6620.65s]  the biggest FPS hog. No, we're not doing potato mode yet. Tell the boosters to... okay. So...
[6622.25s -> 6627.30s]  and then release. Aim at the marked area on the rust bucket and hope... but wait, are these
[6627.30s -> 6639.80s]  boosters though? Do I have to tap like F? Oh, okay. There it is. So that's it. Okay.
[6653.80s -> 6658.20s]  And that's our cue. Climb aboard, Rico. Out of here, people. Let's move.
[6667.70s -> 6692.54s]  Time for Gary's mod. Not even... Stunt on... what? Stunt on the van?
[6700.14s -> 6721.83s]  Cover Garland's escape. Wait, what do you mean their escape? What's wrong with you?
[6731.51s -> 6735.99s]  Oh, you're so high. I gotta catch you. I can catch you. I'll get you. I'll get you. I'll get you.
[6737.29s -> 6752.25s]  I'm gonna catch her. I'll catch her with my hands. I have to get her back over here.
[6752.25s -> 6778.92s]  Oh, now we're getting fired at. Where do these people come from? All right, let's go.
[6779.48s -> 6792.15s]  Don't let them wreck us. Don't... I won't let them wreck us. Don't worry.
[6793.75s -> 6797.27s]  I came here to shoot my next picture. My magnum opus.
[6801.45s -> 6804.81s]  It looks like a paradise, but everywhere you go, it's permits.
[6804.81s -> 6807.61s]  They only give you permits if you're Espinosa Telecom.
[6808.33s -> 6817.11s]  Espinosa Telecom. They got this place locked down tighter than a clam's ass and high tide.
[6817.11s -> 6821.18s]  What does that even mean? All right, we're fine.
[6821.18s -> 6824.30s]  Wish I had a DP in the car. You're doing beautiful work.
[6825.82s -> 6830.46s]  You close stuff up for a living. Most guys just pretend to do it. Let the effects department
[6830.46s -> 6836.70s]  handle the rest. Not you and me, Rico. We're a pair. Stick with me, kid.
[6836.78s -> 6839.34s]  Starring in my picture. And I get run over by the car.
[6841.70s -> 6845.70s]  Solis will love you. The world will love you.
[6849.75s -> 6856.55s]  Damn it. Where are we going? I'm gonna go. This game hurts my brain. I'm so sorry.
[6857.19s -> 6863.51s]  We just met and I'm already faking your death. Be a sport, sport. You're almost ready for the day.
[6864.15s -> 6868.78s]  Oh, no. Let go of that.
[6870.78s -> 6873.98s]  Get the black hand's attention. Damn it.
[6875.18s -> 6881.74s]  Guess I better find a black hand outpost. Holy shit. All right, I gotta.
[6889.53s -> 6897.59s]  That's how I always wanted to go. Are you kidding? I would get about my own death. Make it dramatic.
[6899.27s -> 6903.59s]  Should buy me a few hours. Is this far enough away? Is this far enough away?
[6910.46s -> 6928.54s]  Actual. Actually Garry's mod. Actually fucking Garry's mod. All right, let's go.
[6930.79s -> 6936.81s]  Lure them away. Make it look like they died in a big explosion. That's how I always wanted to go.
[6937.85s -> 6955.32s]  I can't talk what I just did, lady. All right, here we are. Make it look bad. All right, lure
[6955.32s -> 6970.52s]  them away. Watch it. Watch it. I have to. She's going off into the water. I'm so much cooler.
[6971.24s -> 6978.34s]  Well, you somehow with even with nitrous attached, you are faster than.
[6979.14s -> 6992.01s]  Now to wreck this van, I guess. Okay, wreck the van. That wasn't enough to wreck the van.
[6996.10s -> 7011.30s]  The van is still fine. Not good enough. Get the fuck out of my way. I'm trying to destroy myself.
[7012.02s -> 7032.95s]  Oh, I'm supposed to get out of the van. Get out of the van. I did it. I wrecked. I did it.
[7034.82s -> 7076.57s]  No, get back there quick. It's me, Dutch Vanderland. Move. Move. Move. That guy was
[7076.57s -> 7084.66s]  aiming his wrist completely backwards. All right, I gotta tap it. I'm ready to go over the jump
[7085.77s -> 7089.61s]  and then I'm gonna get out. I'm not gonna be inside. Why don't I just skip that? I'm gonna
[7089.61s -> 7096.94s]  skip the whole fucking thing. Now to wreck this van, I guess. See, like I just skipped all that
[7096.94s -> 7119.56s]  bullshit. It's driving around the mountain. Add thrusters to it. I can't get in the van.
[7120.36s -> 7143.66s]  It's gonna land. I'm gonna die. We're good.
[7153.26s -> 7153.82s]  All right, it worked.
[7154.78s -> 7164.71s]  I want to get on the bus. Help Garland shoot her opus. Search the map for stunts and scene shots.
[7164.71s -> 7177.70s]  Pretty cool feature. That's what I was looking for. This bike is fast.
[7183.70s -> 7192.57s]  What are you doing? Why are you like this? Why are you like this? I don't even care.
[7193.53s -> 7214.98s]  Damn it. Tornado. What do you mean tornado? Tornado. Tornado. Tornado. Oh, there's a tornado over
[7214.98s -> 7248.54s]  there. There is a. Cool. Let's take a look. Thanks for the boost. I appreciate it. All right,
[7248.54s -> 7260.09s]  let's go to the tornado. I lost control of the bike. Oh, fuck. That is a suicide drive. That
[7260.09s -> 7267.69s]  guy still has a fucking... I can't even pay attention. Do you see that bird explosion?
[7268.65s -> 7282.95s]  My tire is fucked up. Hold on. I gotta spray it now. I wish you would just get out of the fucking
[7282.95s -> 7296.44s]  way. Fine. You want to go to the tornado too? That's fine with me. New bike. This is a fast one.
[7297.32s -> 7318.25s]  How far away is the tornado? Looks pretty far away. Oh shit. Okay, it worked. It actually worked.
[7322.62s -> 7337.83s]  How do I lose the police? Oh, this is not the way that I want to be going. This way.
[7338.79s -> 7363.99s]  No, no, no. Put that away. It's safer to be this way and somehow you are right next to me. Don't
[7363.99s -> 7387.29s]  ask me how. Here's the tornado. This guy's still right behind me. I was gonna say. No way. I can
[7387.29s -> 7397.03s]  take a second here to make sure I get the right spot. No, he is right behind me. I'm not even
[7397.03s -> 7415.70s]  stuck on here. I'm taking them on. Here there's a helicopter. It's still chasing me. I am surprised
[7415.70s -> 7432.14s]  you can even get over here. Okay. We're almost at the tornado. It's right here. There it is.
[7433.48s -> 7454.63s]  Oh, easy though. I'm safe, right? This is so far away. You actually made it. Well,
[7455.35s -> 7468.62s]  all right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We're so close.
[7469.34s -> 7488.46s]  What can you even do here? Can I be like a storm chaser? All right. Here it is. Holy shit.
[7489.42s -> 7496.14s]  Do these people know there's a tornado on the road? I don't, nobody seems to really give a shit.
[7496.78s -> 7508.09s]  If I live, if I go in here. Oh my goodness. This is huge. Okay. I'm in it. I made it.
[7540.42s -> 7550.98s]  That's a wingsuit in there. What the fuck was that? Is that a blimp?
[7555.48s -> 7560.84s]  Helicopters. Why would you even fly over here? What the hell are you thinking?
[7563.83s -> 7566.71s]  Look at all these cars.
[7571.96s -> 7575.72s]  Oh no, no, no. Don't die again. All right. I'm going to be flying for this.
[7576.36s -> 7594.70s]  All right. Wingsuit activated. Oh, all your organs flying out of your body right now.
[7598.63s -> 7607.99s]  No. Shit. Activate the wingsuit again. Quick. Whoa. I just scraped the ground.
[7609.75s -> 7630.55s]  Holy shit. I'm going all the way up. How high can I go? Is that it? How high am I?
[7633.29s -> 7647.56s]  I'm not even sure where I am. Holy fuck. That's crazy. I'm going up even higher. All right. This
[7647.56s -> 7677.45s]  is where we Spider-Man Empire State Building. That's fun. Look at this. All right. Let me do
[7677.45s -> 7688.84s]  one more thing. I just want to be all the way at the top. I want to lose control. I don't have a
[7688.84s -> 7700.25s]  wingsuit on. I just want to get off this and be flailing around. Like that. I guess it doesn't
[7700.25s -> 7720.41s]  matter. Hold on. Can I not get back in like this? I guess not. I'm trying to stay in the ragdoll,
[7720.97s -> 7747.42s]  but it looks like you just float. Where do we end up? I'm not sure. This is chaos though,
[7747.42s -> 7762.31s]  apparently. I'm causing chaos. Did I get out of the eye of the storm? No. I'm going around again.
[7762.31s -> 7780.18s]  There's a helicopter in here now. Where's the helicopter? Where'd the helicopter go?
[7780.82s -> 7787.40s]  I have to get a plane into the tornado. Oh, there's a helicopter.
[7799.70s -> 7815.64s]  Plane. Plane. We have a problem. We have a big problem. I can't do anything. Control. E. Space.
[7816.28s -> 7830.95s]  Alt. Click. Q. I can't do anything. Can I pull a gun out or something? Stay in ragdoll. Hold control.
[7834.54s -> 7844.55s]  Hold control. I can't do anything. Can I like eat a grenade or something?
[7845.19s -> 7857.82s]  Oye Rico, you meet that guy yet? He might be able to help. No, I didn't meet that guy yet.
[7857.82s -> 7871.59s]  I will. All right, I need to get out of this. How do I get... I don't want to like exit the game.
[7874.25s -> 7886.20s]  I will. Fish gave me a few minutes. I need to grab onto something. Is this just a table flying
[7886.20s -> 7895.48s]  around? Just wait for it to blow over. Will this disappear? Oh wait, here comes a blimp.
[7896.20s -> 7900.44s]  The blimp is going to get sucked in. And then I'm going to grapple onto the blimp. It seems
[7900.44s -> 7911.80s]  like the only thing I'm able to do. Come on, pull it in close enough. Or even another helicopter.
[7911.80s -> 7921.80s]  I gotta... No, it's flying around too erratically. Table. Can I grab the table? Okay, I'm going to go
[7921.80s -> 7929.80s]  to... I'm going to try to grapple the table. I can get it. It's going to be close. I just had the
[7929.80s -> 7947.26s]  indicator. Okay, hold on. Fuck. I can't grab it. I need to grab that. Fucking god damn it.
[7947.74s -> 7962.86s]  I need another table. I need to grapple a table. Or a tree? I had the indicator on the fucking table.
[7963.58s -> 7977.02s]  Don't worry, in like another couple minutes a table will come out. Come on, up higher.
[7978.87s -> 7986.23s]  I can use the grapple hook though. That's really important. I just need something that I can grab
[7986.23s -> 8010.87s]  to fly up here. Like that. That hunk of metal right there. Come on. Go up. Can't grab the tree. This
[8010.95s -> 8015.67s]  should be the loading screen of the game. I'm so mad that I couldn't grab that table when I had a
[8015.67s -> 8024.71s]  chance. The tornado is moving, so maybe we'll get another opportunity. The tornado is moving. Am I
[8024.71s -> 8032.42s]  going towards the direction of this? Pass through the ring faster than 70 miles per hour. I think
[8032.42s -> 8056.66s]  I'm going that fast. I hear a noise. Can I grab that? I'm not low enough. That sounds like a table.
[8057.46s -> 8073.80s]  Can I booster myself? No, I can't. I wish I could. Debris? Here comes debris. Might have a chance
[8073.80s -> 8083.94s]  here in a second. Debris on the way up. You can see a table? Any tables in there? Order a boat?
[8087.27s -> 8103.53s]  Can I order something? I'm getting lower to the ground. Get it? I can't grapple it. No, I'm too
[8103.53s -> 8120.90s]  high. Almost. I was so close. Press E? I can't do anything. Can't you scrape? I can't do anything.
[8120.90s -> 8130.89s]  All I can do is spin around in a circle. Yeah, there is one way to escape this. That's a table
[8131.77s -> 8152.74s]  coming up through the vent here. Did I miss the table? Did I really? No, I didn't. What a great
[8152.74s -> 8170.04s]  stream. All right, I'm just going to fast travel. Wait, did I just get up? Table right there?
[8176.95s -> 8190.92s]  All right, I'm gonna go here. How do I fast travel? I don't think I even can. What the fuck am I?
[8191.48s -> 8200.68s]  What's happening? No, I'm not. I have to get out on my own. I can't use voice commands.
[8200.68s -> 8204.04s]  What do you mean you can't use voice commands? I just read somebody's chat room message.
[8204.92s -> 8210.74s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a
[8210.74s -> 8224.12s]  minute. I just saw something right here. Somebody wrote that. We're going over water right now.
[8224.12s -> 8240.15s]  There's nothing here. I missed my opportunity like twice. Can't do it to trees. Go into the
[8240.15s -> 8254.02s]  tornado. I can't really control where I'm going. I can't. I have to stop this. I have to stop this
[8254.02s -> 8259.46s]  right now. Somebody just wrote I'm getting sick to my stomach and that's where I have to. I gotta
[8259.46s -> 8282.68s]  like make sure I don't make somebody throw up. I'm making people sick. Wait. I have to get out of
[8282.68s -> 8289.05s]  here. I have to get out of here guys. There's no more. This is not fun anymore. This is just
[8289.05s -> 8297.19s]  bad. This is not fun. There's no tables to grab onto. We're going over a couple of houses.
[8297.75s -> 8311.59s]  There's an opportunity right here when we go over this house. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[8311.59s -> 8320.60s]  Right there. Come on. Turn this way. Come on. See it? You see it right? You see it. You see it. You
[8320.60s -> 8338.81s]  see it. Come on. You see it. I do. Come on. There comes another blimp. Get to the top.
[8342.06s -> 8362.23s]  Give me ins... It didn't get it. What? How did it not get that? I... I'm out. I got out. All right.
[8362.23s -> 8381.06s]  We're good. I feel better. Time to respawn in the tornado. Now I need to get a plane
[8382.33s -> 8392.92s]  fly into it. That's a really good idea. So let me track down a plane. Are you telling me that guy
[8392.92s -> 8398.76s]  gets away? That guy gets away? The guy on the motorcycle gets the fuck away? But not the guy
[8398.76s -> 8413.38s]  in the 3000 pound car? I need a plane. How do I get a plane? Is there like an airfield or something
[8413.38s -> 8430.70s]  around here? Wingsuit stunt. Car stunt. Speed stunt. You can order it. Get one from your airdrop.
[8430.70s -> 8454.82s]  That doesn't exist. There's a plane in the airport. Where's an airport? Airport. That was a plane
[8454.82s -> 8466.68s]  just crashing. I feel like if I wait long enough, a plane will just... It's me. I just have to go
[8466.68s -> 8479.05s]  somewhere and just look in the sky. All right. What about over here? I just heard a plane. What
[8479.05s -> 8501.98s]  if I get up here? Right there. Come here. Come on. Pinpoint fucking accuracy. And was it worth it?
[8501.98s -> 8520.58s]  Was it worth it in the end? Give me a fucking plane. He actually got out of that. What a bunch
[8520.58s -> 8540.55s]  of dog shit. Get me up here. Will you get up there, dude? What are you doing? You're driving me nuts.
[8540.55s -> 8551.99s]  That's really fucking funny. I'm ready for a plane.
[8572.71s -> 8576.47s]  Apparently not ready for the plane to drive by me.
[8587.34s -> 8596.41s]  Oh, I'm so upset right now. Another one's gonna just drive by, right? This is like the plane drive
[8596.41s -> 8604.74s]  by zone. The tornado's gone. There's no more tornado. There's no point to do this right now.
[8613.00s -> 8653.88s]  Okay. Come here, you motherfucker. What the fuck? Here's my chance. Get over here. Fly over here.
[8653.88s -> 8674.63s]  Do I have... I'm gonna have to... I got a drastic... I'm right here, man. I'm right here.
[8679.94s -> 8742.63s]  I did it too, man. I right-clicked. I was gonna drive right into the fucking rock.
[8755.26s -> 8762.33s]  What? Did they crash into each other? Why are you driving that close to the water?
[8762.97s -> 8771.27s]  What's wrong with you? You're skimming the water right now. There's no reason to be doing what
[8771.27s -> 8806.62s]  you're doing. It's gonna go in the water. It's gonna fall in the water. All right, let's go.
[8811.06s -> 8830.87s]  Airport. No, it's too far. Just drop. Just respawn. Move on. Okay, let's take a look at the minimap
[8830.87s -> 8837.18s]  for a second and see what we got. I need... Okay, so we got some stunt missions.
[8840.25s -> 8849.27s]  Cantos. That looks like an airport. Found one. Okay, I just gotta go this way to Cantos.
[8849.83s -> 8854.97s]  I need to make a waypoint. That's a really strange waypoint marker that I have to make.
[8855.99s -> 8863.06s]  What even button is that? Toggle waypoint. Tap... What is that? It's space. Okay, I was like,
[8863.06s -> 8868.14s]  what is that on the keyboard? I thought it was an underscore.
[8883.13s -> 8886.92s]  Okay, wait. That guy's a bike. No, forget the bike.
[8897.26s -> 8905.72s]  Okay, here we go.
[8905.72s -> 8911.94s]  You suck.
[8924.74s -> 8935.00s]  There we go. I can't do it. I'm trying to go too fast. There we go.
[8948.62s -> 8954.15s]  Straight ahead. Every time he says, here we go, is when he hits the ground.
[8955.11s -> 8985.43s]  I was looking at chat. That didn't count. That didn't do anything.
[8995.26s -> 9022.90s]  All right, we're almost there. That sounded like an elephant.
[9036.57s -> 9042.34s]  Do something cool. I can't. I can't do anything. I fucking swear to God.
[9051.74s -> 9077.53s]  What the fuck? All right, so where's the airport? Over here. Almost there. Airport.
[9087.75s -> 9088.95s]  I fucking hate myself.
[9101.10s -> 9105.02s]  So where the fuck is the airport? It's like right over the bridge here.
[9105.98s -> 9118.63s]  So like over here. Behind the hill. All right, let's get a plane.
[9124.79s -> 9127.99s]  Is this... Do these things work? Could you actually do this?
[9130.65s -> 9140.94s]  All right, plane. There's a plane right there. Can I get in... Can I get... Is that a plane I can get?
[9141.58s -> 9158.26s]  What happened to you? It really is just... Oh look, a little guy. Let's take it.
[9159.30s -> 9184.10s]  How do you fly planes? I have no idea. Hold C or Z to turn. C or Z? I'm holding E.
[9184.82s -> 9191.13s]  Control. Okay, it's control. Off we go. Why am I going backwards?
[9193.50s -> 9196.06s]  That doesn't make any logical sense. Why am I going backwards?
[9213.91s -> 9224.34s]  Okay, control is reverse. If you were curious. Shift is drive plane. Z is turn.
[9224.98s -> 9235.59s]  No, it's not. I know. I'm going to clear it. I'll clear it. Okay, here we go.
[9236.15s -> 9249.54s]  So how do I pull up? What's pull up? Oh wow. Apparently that.
[9276.70s -> 9277.66s]  Get big plane.
[9278.38s -> 9291.86s]  Hey, Rico. Are you talking to me? Okay, so W. Why am I not pulling up? Why is it not working?
[9309.70s -> 9314.44s]  That did the complete opposite last time. Can I ding my head? Can I ding my head?
[9317.50s -> 9328.26s]  I sure can. I sure can. Let's try it again.
[9336.41s -> 9348.68s]  I'm running out of planes. It's okay. Just... So S. Is it S or W? It is W.
[9349.40s -> 9356.49s]  Or is it S? Okay, it's S. And then W is...
[9358.14s -> 9362.86s]  How in the name of fucking God are you supposed to control? Okay, Z and C is just tilt. Okay,
[9362.86s -> 9382.39s]  I got it. All right, we're gonna find a tornado. Switch vehicle position. What does that do for me?
[9383.91s -> 9419.00s]  Oh, it puts... Okay, it's still going. Don't worry, it'll come back. It'll come back and I'll get it.
[9419.00s -> 9440.39s]  Wait a second. Hold on. All right, fine. Never mind. It just exploded. I don't know where it
[9440.39s -> 9458.46s]  exploded, but it did. I'm going very fast. All right. You thought I was gonna bump on the ground,
[9458.46s -> 9478.02s]  didn't you? Nope. You can't take the big one. What the fuck was that? What? No, I can take a big,
[9478.02s -> 9497.48s]  huge plane. All right, I'm gonna do this in line. Oh, I'm not doing anything. I'm waiting for this
[9497.48s -> 9515.29s]  other plane to take off before I do anything. I can't turn the fucking plane. Earth. I'm almost
[9515.29s -> 9540.82s]  there. Okay, here we go. Let's go. How do I take this? This thing is so huge. I don't even know
[9540.82s -> 9556.76s]  how to go with this. How can I go? I'm losing control. I don't know if I'm... Am I upside down?
[9556.76s -> 9568.82s]  Am I up or down? Does anybody know if I'm up or down? I think I'm up. I can't tell which way the
[9568.82s -> 9576.70s]  plane is going. I don't know. I think we're on... Which plane are we on? Are we upside down?
[9577.58s -> 9599.13s]  I don't know. I am. All right, let's go this way. I am upside down.
[9605.74s -> 9616.87s]  Oh, it's still going. Why does it keep zooming out? Do you see what that's doing? Am I at an
[9616.87s -> 9631.78s]  unreachable place? I can't even tell. Am I getting closer or further away from this object?
[9652.30s -> 9671.88s]  Oh, the world's coming in too quick. Oh, holy shit. Okay, I'm starting to be able to see the
[9671.88s -> 9676.12s]  world in a 3D plane. All right, now I get it. Now I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[9681.22s -> 9701.34s]  Oh, give me this fucking thing. All right, well, you got blocked by the sneeze guard.
[9704.36s -> 9713.42s]  One thrust. It's hot. All right, I'm ready.
[9737.74s -> 9740.46s]  No, wait, wait, wait, wait. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
[9742.94s -> 9747.06s]  Why is this tipping over? It's got to be on the edges like here.
[9748.02s -> 9758.10s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[9795.78s -> 9796.50s]  That's better, right?
[9802.49s -> 9807.35s]  Balloons. What do you mean? What are you talking about balloons?
[9809.72s -> 9815.00s]  No, no, no. Dude, I want to fly, man. I want to get going. Okay, here we go.
[9816.97s -> 9834.92s]  In three, two, one. Let's take it off. Okay, well,
[9838.55s -> 9842.39s]  didn't really do what I thought it was going to do. At least I flew.
[9850.79s -> 9865.51s]  Jet ski. Thank you. I'll take it. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[9866.47s -> 9887.38s]  Okay, come here. Oh, fuck. That was mean. Kind of a mean guy though. How can I? Never mind. I thought
[9887.38s -> 9925.40s]  it was a... What? Is somebody in that boat? Oh, what the fuck is this person doing? What's wrong
[9925.40s -> 9943.46s]  with you? Why would you drive like this? I need to stay on here. You're still going. Okay. At what
[9943.46s -> 9947.29s]  point are you going to be done with this? I should be asking myself the same question.
[9948.01s -> 9966.25s]  And I didn't get her. Didn't get her. Nope, sorry. You just turned her boat into wood.
[9975.35s -> 9986.74s]  Where's the panel? I want the balloon. Okay, booster. Oh, let's see. So what can I do here for
[9986.74s -> 9997.34s]  airlifter? Low, medium, or high airlift? Let's try it. Let's tap. Okay, is this equipped?
[10011.64s -> 10025.91s]  Kidding me. We're gonna let that stop you. Let's go, lady. You and me. On a grand adventure.
[10033.66s -> 10040.22s]  Oh, there we go. There we go. I need more up here. No, I need him in the back. I mean,
[10040.22s -> 10046.78s]  in the back, in the back, in the back. Where is she? Is she still in the... Is she still here? I
[10046.78s -> 10059.06s]  can't see her. I gotta get some in the back. She's still here with me. The boat is smoking,
[10059.06s -> 10071.53s]  but she's still in here. All right, that levels it up. Why are we falling? There we go.
[10077.13s -> 10092.02s]  Look at that. Get some back here. Oh, that hit her in the head. How do I take this off?
[10092.82s -> 10102.63s]  How do I take that one off? How do I take this one off her back? Oh, there's two. There are two
[10102.63s -> 10120.73s]  inside of her. Is she trying to drive? How do I get that off? Oh, wait, she's attached.
[10120.73s -> 10143.91s]  She's attached. I forgot. I can't just... Oh, how do I get out of here? Can I... I gotta,
[10143.91s -> 10153.54s]  I gotta like pick her up. I need to get on the bottom of the boat. I want on the bottom of the
[10153.54s -> 10173.67s]  boat, please. Oops. Oh, fuck. I gotta... Bring it down. No, bring it down.
[10183.51s -> 10193.90s]  Okay, everything's good. All right, just... You just drive the boat again. You were doing
[10193.90s -> 10211.16s]  a good job driving. Why are the three helicopters just hanging on over here?
[10211.80s -> 10216.84s]  I feel like I need to see this. I need to get over there. I need to understand why they're there.
[10223.00s -> 10247.05s]  Ow. What the fuck are they doing? It's so bright, but I need to see. Ah, I can't even look at it.
[10247.05s -> 10256.66s]  I need to get over there though. They're shooting at each other. What are they? Why are they firing
[10256.66s -> 10298.79s]  at each other? Turn off bloom. Hold on. What is it? Which... Where's bloom? I don't see bloom. That's
[10298.79s -> 10309.62s]  the only... All right. Global illumination? Well, that didn't do anything. I need to see how this
[10309.62s -> 10317.83s]  plays out. Just don't look at the screen for like five minutes. Somebody got a hit on someone.
[10317.83s -> 10332.25s]  The middle one took a little damage. Aren't these all on the same team? Why would they be doing this?
[10344.47s -> 10375.42s]  They're invincible somehow. What if I take them down? Well, I was allowed to destroy it somehow.
[10376.06s -> 10399.10s]  Fucking idiots. I don't know how to fly this. Dammit! No! Fly it! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[10399.74s -> 10425.61s]  Is it spent? It's shipped! Yeah! All right, back to civilization. Switch the camera a little bit. Is
[10425.61s -> 10435.02s]  it like a cinematic camera? No. Propeller isn't moving too slow, but that's a scientific reason
[10435.02s -> 10450.90s]  for that. Tornado. You got it. What was the last time we did a mission? I don't remember a mission.
[10450.90s -> 10456.65s]  I need to pitch this a little bit so we can start to get some traction here.
[10457.77s -> 10490.30s]  Are there no more bullets in anything? What? Don't do the awuga. Go. Oh my fucking god! Why am I
[10490.30s -> 10539.66s]  so stupid? Get there. No! Get there, get there. It's still savable. I pressed fucking E and I've
[10539.66s -> 10562.70s]  j- oh my god. I hate- I hate it when I do things like that. There's another cover-up. All right,
[10562.70s -> 10568.28s]  hijacked vehicle. This one. Okay, let's get it. Grappled to the bottom of the ocean on it. I won't
[10568.28s -> 10582.20s]  be able to swim back up, man. We didn't get to fly into this one. Well, to be fair, we probably saved
[10582.20s -> 10595.14s]  ourselves at least 45 minutes of nothing. Mm-hmm. I was gonna get all the way there.
[10603.13s -> 10605.37s]  Who's the guy that I need to hijack?
[10624.15s -> 10633.85s]  Oh fuck. You're good. All right, that was a fun little thing. Now we're all safe.
[10634.57s -> 10649.06s]  I got jumped out of the car. Why would you jump out of the car?
[10657.45s -> 10663.13s]  Why are you jumping out of the car? Wait a second. Are you gonna jump off the motorcycle?
[10668.90s -> 10710.63s]  You idiot. Nice bike. Did he do a wheelie? I was trying to fucking crush that guy.
[10723.67s -> 10749.77s]  Ah, just get in the car. I can't take this button. Okay. I'm not looking at chat ever again for the
[10749.77s -> 10786.17s]  rest of my life. Never. For the rest of my whole life. That's fair. Airport nearby. No,
[10786.17s -> 10790.81s]  I gotta do a mission. I have to do something. We've been doing dog shit for the last like two
[10790.81s -> 10797.46s]  straight hours. I don't even know what the first mission of the game is. Is this traversable?
[10798.42s -> 10833.48s]  Yep. That's the point of the game. Well, yeah, right? I mean, this road. Have the lady got up?
[10834.12s -> 10846.54s]  Whatever. He did so many spins. She didn't even get a hit. She just pretended to get hit.
[10862.02s -> 10883.32s]  What exploded? Why was there an explosion? All right, make our way this way. Start the Lapa project.
[10884.04s -> 10908.60s]  Why is it telling me to go the other way? I'm going the right way, right? I don't think a Subaru
[10908.60s -> 10932.52s]  Outback is gonna make it over here. What? I'm trying to get in the car.
[10945.72s -> 10954.52s]  I'm trying to just die. All right, I want the car back. Give it to me. Give me the car back. There's
[10954.52s -> 10959.90s]  one balloon popped. Two balloons popped. How many is it gonna take? Last one coming in.
[10961.56s -> 10993.45s]  I'm trying to... I don't even know where this is trying to tell me to go. Scripted. Well, yeah,
[10993.45s -> 11017.88s]  that one was. It's so much safer to do this. This is all the way across the map. Holy shit. Thank God.
[11020.84s -> 11029.46s]  This is really that far away. Oh my fucking God. Why am I going here? Why did I decide that this
[11029.46s -> 11044.30s]  was a good idea? Okay. Anyways, I think that instead of that, get there by a plane? Now you're
[11044.30s -> 11066.04s]  thinking. Now you're thinking. End of stream voice? What are you talking about? Wait, what the hell
[11066.04s -> 11081.48s]  are you guys talking about? I heard it? What do you mean you heard it? I'm not stopping the stream
[11081.48s -> 11102.66s]  right now. All right, this time we're gonna get there quick with a plane. All right, plane. Not a
[11102.66s -> 11107.98s]  big one. Just a little one. Just one big enough to get us where we want to go. One right here.
[11109.66s -> 11124.12s]  No, the stream's not ending. There we go. Let's move. This will get us there very quickly.
[11138.18s -> 11147.77s]  There we go. Straight it out. Don't go upside down. Just get there and be fine. No, I'm not gonna fly
[11147.77s -> 11156.36s]  upside down again. Press E for turbo. You know, that would be very interesting if that existed,
[11157.08s -> 11166.01s]  but it just doesn't. I'm sorry. Fly upside down into the tornado. I know it's a tornado,
[11166.01s -> 11184.28s]  but don't get me distracted. Hold E and get on the roof. I'm only gonna try this. No.
[11190.58s -> 11209.34s]  Hold E and get on the roof. What does L mean? What do you mean L? L? L. Oh, I had to press up.
[11210.14s -> 11224.58s]  All right, that's kind of cool. That's cool. All right. Can I make it through? Do you think I can
[11224.58s -> 11240.41s]  get through the tornado? What do you think? Oh, already a struggle. I made it. I'm good. I'm
[11240.41s -> 11253.99s]  currently... am I out running it? Yeah, I got through. Pretty good nausea stream. All right,
[11253.99s -> 11268.46s]  that was a good stream. All right, time to go home. Just kidding. Okay, almost there. Start
[11269.26s -> 11284.92s]  the Elapa project. How come this doesn't have a horn? I'm gonna pee my pants. I should probably
[11284.92s -> 11296.54s]  do something about that, right? Press E for horn. E? Can I walk on this? Yeah, you can. Okay,
[11296.54s -> 11306.60s]  I can't like walk around out here. Can I go on the wing? This is so dumb. Wow, don't do that.
[11316.74s -> 11329.96s]  I gotta go there. See, if this is a real plane, this would just hit me right in the face.
[11336.95s -> 11352.58s]  Okay, see you later. We're gonna go... end of the plane voice. Yeah, end of the plane voice.
[11354.17s -> 11374.44s]  What did you do? Oh my goodness. Okay, here we are. All right. Okay, so I think... okay.
[11376.66s -> 11385.32s]  I... okay, so looks like... I'm just gonna piss. I'll be right back.
[11573.18s -> 11591.40s]  All right, back. All right, so that brings us to... that brings us, unfortunately, here
[11591.40s -> 11602.42s]  to the... I can't... people are gonna actually leave. A bunch of people are probably gonna leave.
[11606.26s -> 11607.94s]  People just see that in the image and they just leave.
[11613.51s -> 11616.47s]  I probably shouldn't do that. That's like not even like... okay, so...
[11617.27s -> 11628.10s]  how do I do this? Oh, it's over there.
[11633.18s -> 11640.90s]  Right here. 40 people just left. Oh, damn it. Whatever. It's all right.
[11645.30s -> 11646.10s]  It's all right.
[11662.62s -> 11665.98s]  Pilots. You guys... I thought you guys were giving me shit.
[11670.36s -> 11678.28s]  Request... home to the free spirit of breathing people have... Request travel. Select an available
[11678.28s -> 11690.04s]  pilot. Each pilot will need to refuel after their flight, making them unavailable. Oh.
[11696.87s -> 11702.20s]  Really? Okay. Do you know what would be funny right now? If Jerm was like...
[11702.20s -> 11704.28s]  didn't open his parachute and he just landed on the ground.
[11710.23s -> 11734.52s]  Where the fuck do you want me to go? Oh, no. It need to be Izzy.
[11769.98s -> 11771.66s]  I'll get there eventually. Don't worry.
[11788.57s -> 11794.17s]  All right. I need a chopper. Open... there really is a supply drop. I can't fucking believe it.
[11797.26s -> 11803.50s]  Edit... open the supply drop menu with three. Pick an available pilot and edit their loadout.
[11807.78s -> 11815.08s]  Oh my god. Civilian vehicles. Okay. R, please.
[11842.81s -> 11845.37s]  Sending you coordinates. I forgot it was...
[11846.41s -> 11856.76s]  shipped. Why Izzy? Nice city. Poor city. Always been that way.
[11857.80s -> 11863.24s]  Do you think... okay. Do you think I can jump out and then grab and come back in?
[11863.24s -> 11871.18s]  All the money is there. So, people in Kuya get by other ways. Like selling... what? I can't fly
[11871.26s -> 11885.64s]  this thing. Oh, you turn on the radio. Need music. Read my mind. Who is driving this?
[11888.97s -> 11943.96s]  Uh, I can't get back in. I made it. I don't know who was flying that before, but that was weird.
[11944.60s -> 11953.16s]  I can't fly it. Can she fly this thing? No. Radio, right?
[11957.98s -> 11966.87s]  What does she want for a station? Oh, here it comes. Oh, what does every song ever made in 2010
[11966.87s -> 12043.24s]  Beyond? We're dropping fast. Listen. Here it comes. All right, let's go. Nice.
[12056.90s -> 12073.83s]  Oh, shit. Can she die? I thought she was immune. This is taking us a long time.
[12080.90s -> 12089.56s]  Boosters? No, but that'll ruin everything. Now she's not gonna move. Why have you guys told me
[12089.56s -> 12134.65s]  to do this? She'll make it eventually. How's it going, Izzy? Look at all these hackers.
[12134.65s -> 12139.13s]  But none of that matters unless we can disable Yappa's defenses. Izzy and I have been working
[12139.13s -> 12146.90s]  on that. All of these facilities house prototype weather cores, and each core is connected to
[12146.90s -> 12153.61s]  Yappa's defense network. Towers with artillery? Si. If we can plant a virus in those weather cores,
[12153.61s -> 12157.85s]  we can send a message up the network causing malfunctions in the tower's machinery.
[12158.09s -> 12163.53s]  Inside the server room. You don't have to be in there. You could be like in your bedroom.
[12166.01s -> 12172.65s]  It's so hot in there. You know how hot one server gets? They have server farms in fucking
[12172.65s -> 12176.89s]  Antarctica because it gets so hot in there. You can't physically be inside this room.
[12180.33s -> 12185.29s]  What's that? Information on a place called La Masmora. It's a prison hidden in the desert.
[12186.62s -> 12193.94s]  Yeah, that's true. I think my uncle Lanza might still be alive. If he is, he's being held there.
[12195.00s -> 12200.81s]  And he can help us get into Zora Uno. He helped your father build project Yappa.
[12202.34s -> 12207.62s]  Get out. If he's still alive, I'll find him. Just lower the temperature of the room. Good luck.
[12208.34s -> 12214.82s]  Here is Sona 3. According to Izzy, it's not on the network, but I have an old friend Cesar.
[12214.82s -> 12221.45s]  He has a theory that might help us. Then let's hear what he has to say. And this is Sona 2.
[12222.17s -> 12227.00s]  We don't know much about that facility. Are you ever going to answer this?
[12227.00s -> 12232.36s]  I'm not an agency man anymore. Rico, those coordinates are close. Look.
[12233.99s -> 12238.90s]  Nice. That can't be a coincidence. Like I was just on a normal NPC room. Check it out.
[12239.78s -> 12242.50s]  Just carrying a box. I'm sending you all the data you'll need to your AR lens.
[12243.38s -> 12250.01s]  Good. Let's start hitting Oskar when it hurts. I skipped that at the end of the cutscene,
[12250.01s -> 12265.90s]  but that's okay. Okay, here we go. Bingo. I accomplished it. Let's take out their satellite.
[12269.08s -> 12271.96s]  In fact, that might even be our satellite, but take it out anyways.
[12272.60s -> 12283.14s]  Not hacking in that room anymore, are you? All right, so now there's a wingsuit mission right
[12283.14s -> 12298.52s]  here. What do I have to do about that? What is this? Wingsuit stunt. How do I do that?
[12299.48s -> 12323.10s]  Do I fly through that in the wingsuit? I did it. Oh my leg. I gotta go through the whole thing.
[12323.10s -> 12334.54s]  Okay, hold on. So how am I supposed to be able to see that? You know what I mean?
[12335.34s -> 12354.30s]  I gotta start from all the way back here then. So turn this way. Here we go. One, two, nope.
[12358.34s -> 12365.11s]  I have to activate it up there. I'm not even doing it right. I have to actually be in a
[12365.11s -> 12389.21s]  helicopter and activate it up there. Give me five seconds. How the hell?
[12394.89s -> 12398.41s]  Wait, what? Chat? No, chat. No, what do you mean chat? No, what happened?
[12399.37s -> 12404.89s]  I need to be going way faster than that. What about like this? Can I just...
[12408.86s -> 12415.22s]  I have to be up in the air. I just locked myself in a fucking prison.
[12415.22s -> 12444.02s]  Can I grab that from here? Don't take your rage out on that guy. Rage? Oh fuck it. I don't even
[12444.02s -> 12457.78s]  care. I'm gonna get like 15 points. Where the hell am I going now? I feel like it's something else
[12457.78s -> 12479.90s]  I need to do. Request travel. No, wait. What? I can just go there? I gotta get this waypoint marker
[12479.90s -> 12508.18s]  off. Go back to the tornado? No. Okay, here we go. Track this one. Fly time. Wing suit. If I crash,
[12508.18s -> 12523.03s]  I'll turn the stream off. That's how you know I'm not going to. You guys don't have that much
[12523.03s -> 12530.17s]  confidence in my ability at all, huh? Ah, good night everybody. No. Thought I was gonna crash
[12530.17s -> 12541.75s]  right there, didn't you? I'm gonna go through this weird valley here. What's this? Oh shit,
[12541.75s -> 12544.25s]  he's gonna turn the stream off.
[12564.41s -> 12575.64s]  Escape? Who am I being chased by? Oh, here it comes! Here comes the beat!
[12575.64s -> 12594.33s]  Who am I escaping from? Who am I chasing?
[12616.31s -> 12634.06s]  No, wait! Hey! No! Oh! Fucking E! E! E! E! Oh, I'm so annoyed right now.
[12634.14s -> 12646.23s]  Has this whole country lost its mind? Oh, my goodness gracious. Just get over here.
[12653.72s -> 12668.95s]  Where the fuck is that J? Get off! Get off! Wait, why is there...
[12672.95s -> 12687.38s]  All right, I am gonna press E here because I want to go across.
[12711.50s -> 12725.37s]  That's not a crash. Wing suit in the water. I'm just gonna get close enough I can grab the edge.
[12725.85s -> 12738.12s]  Okay, we are getting close.
[12747.45s -> 12761.29s]  I'm keep trying to just go as fast as I can. How far away is this for real? It's... I'm so fucking
[12761.29s -> 12764.17s]  far away. I really might supposed to get in a car and drive there, seriously.
[12768.17s -> 12786.18s]  How am I ever gonna traverse this? What the fuck? Jesus! Why? What the fuck are you doing?
[12786.18s -> 12836.87s]  What was that? I'm almost there.
[12846.92s -> 12856.84s]  There it is! Something exploded. Is this on low settings? No, not yet.
[12866.10s -> 12900.65s]  We're so close. This isn't low settings? No, it's not. Made it to your house. I hope that wasn't an NPC
[12900.65s -> 12903.93s]  giver. Whatever the fucking quest giver.
[12922.94s -> 12925.90s]  All right, so what's the mission here? Reach the waterfall cave.
[12929.61s -> 12933.21s]  No, I can't just shoot everybody. It's not funny. All right, I need to get up there.
[12933.21s -> 12935.29s]  Reach the waterfall cave. You got it.
[12955.46s -> 12974.57s]  What? Oh, I get the stuff down here, right? Nice. Take the retract motor.
[12975.29s -> 12991.67s]  What do I get for this? A new unlockable? Do I get to... Is this a tracking device?
[12994.30s -> 12995.18s]  Both cave doors.
[12995.42s -> 13001.10s]  This is Avi Huerta. I'm sorry we weren't able to meet. Please, better be worthy than you go.
[13002.14s -> 13009.35s]  Retract it. I promise you. What the fuck does this do?
[13009.91s -> 13019.18s]  Set the retract force to high in the auto column, okay? It'll work automatically after releasing.
[13020.33s -> 13040.81s]  All right, open the door. Am I supposed to just pull this? Hold? I don't get it. Aim at the door
[13040.81s -> 13044.73s]  and hold to start tether, okay? Aim at the wall and release tether, like this wall.
[13046.33s -> 13050.95s]  Oh, it just pulls the... All right, I thought it was gonna do something else.
[13051.83s -> 13056.92s]  I was expecting it to be something else. That's just a regular tether.
[13059.00s -> 13060.84s]  Aim at the other door. Do I really have to do that?
[13064.02s -> 13073.11s]  This is some place, Avi. At least six centuries old. Oh shit, I gotta fly this little go-kart.
[13074.07s -> 13081.06s]  Uh-huh. I promise. Ain't everything. There's a map inside the plane. You can get my coordinates
[13081.06s -> 13086.66s]  from there. Got your map. Where am I going? This thing's kind of cool, actually.
[13087.54s -> 13092.04s]  I'd like to begin with where you're coming from. Back without the hidden behind those doors for a
[13092.04s -> 13099.96s]  reason. I had to open both doors to get this little thing out of there. The Espinozas didn't
[13099.96s -> 13104.60s]  like anyone challenging their narrative. I was imprisoned. My wife won't speak to me.
[13105.32s -> 13109.48s]  My reputation is ruined. Stop blowing things up over there, you dummies.
[13110.84s -> 13118.79s]  I made allies in prison, both seen the cracks in the facade. Now they help me uncover the truth.
[13118.79s -> 13125.78s]  And what do you need me for? I believe I have discovered the path to the tomb last ruler of
[13125.78s -> 13129.86s]  the Prius-Pinoza people of Solís. I wonder what's in there. According to the history books,
[13130.42s -> 13135.70s]  Patrongo was executed for countless murders, but I believe the reality is more complex.
[13135.70s -> 13142.10s]  Did I just GTA spawn the same car like four times? To who? What the hell was that? The Espinozas.
[13142.90s -> 13148.14s]  Their monopoly. If this part of history is not true. All right, should I make it all low settings
[13148.14s -> 13154.54s]  and then put the title, everything on ultra? But just cause for gameplay. Ultra settings. PC,
[13154.54s -> 13162.41s]  1080p, 60fps. Do I have to land this? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Do I have to land this?
[13162.41s -> 13169.11s]  How do I land this? How do I land this? Do I have to land this there? Excuse me.
[13169.99s -> 13175.54s]  How do I land my hovercraft? Oh fuck, I have to land this there.
[13182.04s -> 13190.68s]  Um, I don't know how am I supposed to land this there. I'll try. This fucking Peewee Herman did
[13190.68s -> 13222.54s]  this in one of his movies. I'm certain of it. Oh boy. I thought I just failed the mission.
[13239.70s -> 13252.18s]  It was a landing strip? Oh, your stash is safe. Anything else that you'd like to say? Sweat stains.
[13252.98s -> 13274.25s]  It's a relic. A figure of Otorongo. Mid 16th century. Wait, is that? There was a
[13277.21s -> 13286.12s]  mission here. Okay. Retract the ancient lever. Ancient lever is down here. Okay.
[13295.99s -> 13303.40s]  Put the giant cartoon lever down. That sounded like something. I see it.
[13304.20s -> 13309.96s]  A giant head. Rico, follow it. I can tell what kind of day this is going to be.
[13310.52s -> 13317.53s]  Oh, okay. Can I get on top of it? Can I just run with this thing?
[13319.45s -> 13328.25s]  Come on, let me do like the cartoon log thing. Um, I don't- I'm on it. I was.
[13330.01s -> 13335.42s]  That wuma is an ancient sculpture of an honored person. This one may be Sumac's visage.
[13336.38s -> 13340.14s]  Avi, big guy and I are at the floor of the cave.
[13341.26s -> 13347.80s]  What do you see? There's a mechanism in the ground. Looks about the same size as the head.
[13349.00s -> 13355.00s]  It's a giant lock, Rico. The wuma is the key. Can you use the retract to get the wuma to the mechanism?
[13356.36s -> 13365.74s]  Why not? I'll try.
[13369.34s -> 13373.61s]  Rico, use the retract motor to get the wuma to the lock.
[13374.57s -> 13388.68s]  I'll get it. It'll get in there. Perfectly fine. Just small injuries.
[13391.88s -> 13394.02s]  That hit me right in the fucking head, too.
[13404.50s -> 13408.10s]  Fine, I'll do it the dumb way. I'll do it the way that you want me to do it,
[13408.10s -> 13420.01s]  video game. Come on over here. Get in there.
[13420.89s -> 13426.82s]  If something happened, a door opened up. This is a Nickelodeon game show.
[13427.38s -> 13431.37s]  Where Sumac sleeps eternal. Rico, please.
[13439.42s -> 13446.70s]  Where he sleeps eternal. There's a human skull with a candle inside. Light it and be ready for anything.
[13451.34s -> 13456.38s]  There's text on the wall. What the fuck happened? I'm buried. Only five beds remain.
[13457.34s -> 13460.78s]  That mean anything to you? Get this thing open.
[13461.26s -> 13469.34s]  It sounds like a single line from a longer text. Get it open. If it's gonna screw over Espanosa, count me in.
[13470.70s -> 13476.46s]  Bueno, others close to Otorongo will likely have the other lines. The tombs of his family, his advisors.
[13477.26s -> 13483.30s]  I'll keep my eyes open. Help him uncover the truth.
[13484.10s -> 13490.74s]  Seek out the hidden tombs of Otorongo's family and advisors helping him, and associates will earn you mod points.
[13491.22s -> 13507.99s]  That's good. Everyone thought I was stuck. Sorry, I'm not stuck. I'm absolutely fine, but
[13508.87s -> 13511.59s]  you don't think I'm gonna take this thing for a balloon ride. You're out of your mind.
[13520.81s -> 13533.22s]  I'd say we probably make sure it's balanced, otherwise this whole thing's gonna start turning around.
[13534.31s -> 13540.73s]  I need to just make a circle.
[13546.39s -> 13548.39s]  Fire it up with a slingshot.
[13550.15s -> 13552.15s]  How many D's can I have? Ten? It's ten maximum.
[13554.55s -> 13563.82s]  Away we go. My goodness.
[13575.50s -> 13588.94s]  I can't. It's not gonna go. Put boosters underneath it.
[13592.07s -> 13600.22s]  I mean, it's gonna fly all over the place, but I'll try it. Can I move it with my hands? No.
[13602.30s -> 13605.10s]  All right, so here's what's gonna have to happen. I'm gonna put- let's get up there.
[13607.37s -> 13609.53s]  Let's put balloons. Stay up there, dude.
[13613.29s -> 13615.29s]  Okay, let's balloon it to get it off the ground.
[13620.18s -> 13622.18s]  And then once it's off the ground,
[13623.62s -> 13625.62s]  we'll put the crusters underneath.
[13625.86s -> 13629.62s]  Okay.
[13629.62s -> 13631.62s]  Crusters are A.
[13633.58s -> 13635.50s]  Don't hit me, please.
[13635.50s -> 13639.42s]  God, this is- this is gonna be hard to do this without getting crushed.
[13647.30s -> 13664.71s]  It's reaching the height limit. With these on it, it would- it definitely will not. It'll go flying through fucking air.
[13665.51s -> 13667.75s]  What am I doing? Hold on to my spine.
[13674.94s -> 13679.67s]  What? I don't get it. What the hell?
[13680.15s -> 13692.81s]  Is it not on anymore?
[13692.89s -> 13700.79s]  Hold on. Was it- the wrong fucking thing was on. God damn it, really. I thought it was A.
[13715.99s -> 13719.83s]  Let's go.
[13727.38s -> 13731.88s]  All right, here we go.
[13736.55s -> 13739.83s]  Change the height limit? Change height limit?
[13742.28s -> 13744.52s]  Does it have- is it on the balloons?
[13745.16s -> 13750.10s]  Yeah, but I mean, I have to- I have these things on right now. Shouldn't that not even matter anymore?
[13754.50s -> 13757.22s]  Air height limit.
[13757.22s -> 13758.58s]  Air lifter.
[13758.58s -> 13760.18s]  I mean, it's-
[13760.18s -> 13766.58s]  Where do I do that? This is the tractor.
[13770.10s -> 13773.46s]  Loadout B controlled. How the fuck do I edit mods, right? Okay.
[13774.65s -> 13776.65s]  Peak altitude is at medium.
[13778.12s -> 13785.14s]  No limit. Okay.
[13787.51s -> 13790.07s]  So then I should just get on top of it then.
[13801.03s -> 13804.09s]  No, fuck. I just got hit by the ball.
[13808.86s -> 13813.21s]  Whoa.
[13813.21s -> 13821.26s]  All right, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down. Let's just try to do it with balloons now.
[13823.06s -> 13825.54s]  Because if the height limit is off, then maybe I can just fly out.
[13829.46s -> 13841.54s]  Right? Wouldn't that make sense? Oh fuck. Jesus, I don't know it's gonna happen this quickly. Fuck.
[13844.71s -> 13854.92s]  Oh, no!
[13854.92s -> 13857.08s]  How high went so high so quickly?
[13859.58s -> 13861.42s]  All right, where is it?
[13861.42s -> 13870.14s]  Where's the ball? Okay, I deleted all the- there it comes. Okay.
[13874.89s -> 13878.73s]  Am I- am I out of the way? I don't know if I'm in the way or not. Nope. I'm good.
[13882.14s -> 13884.14s]  It's a fucking asteroid.
[13884.46s -> 13887.02s]  All right, let's
[13887.02s -> 13890.70s]  settle down, settle down. I didn't know it was gonna happen that quickly. I gotta do it in the right place.
[13891.34s -> 13898.57s]  Gonna find like the center of the ball. This is fine right here.
[13899.21s -> 13902.22s]  Right in the nose.
[13906.65s -> 13911.75s]  Okay, now wait a second before I do anything else. Oh no, right here.
[13913.11s -> 13936.12s]  Oh shit.
[13936.12s -> 13939.75s]  What?
[13939.75s -> 13941.59s]  We're still going up.
[13941.59s -> 13953.94s]  We're still going through the clouds. I don't think we've even started a descent. I don't think there is a descent.
[13955.43s -> 13957.43s]  No, yes, there is. Oh fuck, it's descending.
[13957.91s -> 13960.65s]  It's going fast. Ah, I got another balloon. Another balloon?
[13965.14s -> 13967.14s]  We're going really fast.
[13968.90s -> 13971.78s]  I don't- we're going so fast. I can't even fucking do anything.
[13972.82s -> 13974.02s]  Whoa!
[13974.02s -> 13979.02s]  What?
[13979.02s -> 13981.34s]  That just went a thousand miles per hour.
[13984.06s -> 13992.54s]  Oh my god.
[13992.54s -> 13994.62s]  That speed was just increasing the whole time.
[13997.00s -> 14006.78s]  Where is it though? Let me see it. Is it- did it fall back down?
[14007.66s -> 14019.67s]  No, it's gone. Did it land in the jungle? Fuck, really?
[14030.12s -> 14032.42s]  I don't see it anywhere. It's gone.
[14033.06s -> 14038.23s]  Oh well, that was fun.
[14039.11s -> 14043.27s]  That thing did not have a terminal velocity. It just kept going faster and faster. It's in the hole.
[14045.14s -> 14046.34s]  No, it's not.
[14046.34s -> 14062.55s]  That's not- that's not it.
[14062.55s -> 14066.38s]  It's not in the hole.
[14066.38s -> 14068.94s]  Really? I went all the fucking way back down here.
[14087.88s -> 14096.36s]  What the fuck? Where did you guys even come from? Why did a fucking hundred animals just spawn?
[14099.70s -> 14102.10s]  What are you people doing? What are you doing?
[14114.76s -> 14121.98s]  Save him. Oh shit, save- I can save him. You're right. Hold on. I can save him. Where's the balloon? All right, save.
[14126.74s -> 14131.16s]  Are you telling me the water is too strong for this?
[14135.32s -> 14139.40s]  What's it gonna take to pull you out of here, man? Why are you connected to the-
[14141.64s -> 14143.64s]  Get him out! Get him out!
[14158.52s -> 14160.52s]  Hold on, is he gonna fall back down?
[14166.74s -> 14168.98s]  The theory would be he would be falling back down, right?
[14192.46s -> 14195.50s]  Okay, I'm fucking being a psycho. I gotta get out of this cave.
[14196.22s -> 14204.60s]  Like, what the fuck am I doing?
[14210.36s -> 14224.52s]  What the hell do I even have to do now? Okay, we've got a helicopter stunt.
[14226.12s -> 14233.54s]  Speed stunt. Find the rock or riot. All right, hold on. Let me do this first.
[14243.90s -> 14279.03s]  This is gonna be un-fucking-bearable, you guys understand that, right? I can't even fit it on here.
[14282.15s -> 14301.67s]  Oh my fucking god, it really looks like a Nintendo 64 game. Well, I need to change- hold on, I gotta change the title.
[14302.39s -> 14311.21s]  I gotta change the title to, like,
[14311.77s -> 14314.84s]  Just Cause 4.
[14317.80s -> 14323.18s]  Just Cause 4.
[14325.04s -> 14327.54s]  3DS.
[14328.20s -> 14332.49s]  3DS.
[14335.61s -> 14340.17s]  This is a lie, though. How long can I keep this up? But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14341.98s -> 14350.95s]  We're gonna take this a little bit further. Hold on. I'm gonna put a- I'm gonna put a 3DS on the screen.
[14351.35s -> 14372.23s]  Okay, I need just, like, a nice open 3DS image. All right, that looks pretty good. Yeah, this one looks pretty good.
[14372.79s -> 14376.52s]  See if we can get it on there. Yeah, okay.
[14380.26s -> 14381.70s]  Save image.
[14381.70s -> 14389.69s]  Okay.
[14389.69s -> 14391.13s]  Did it work?
[14391.13s -> 14398.42s]  Can you see it?
[14398.58s -> 14404.86s]  Okay.
[14404.86s -> 14431.67s]  Just give me a moment.
[14431.67s -> 14433.91s]  It needs to be a little bit bigger. It needs to be a little bigger.
[14438.10s -> 14441.30s]  You know what I mean? Like, I can't just be that. Like, anyway, like, that's a little bit better.
[14458.12s -> 14461.48s]  All right, that looks pretty good. Maybe a little bit lower to get the edge there.
[14477.86s -> 14493.98s]  Facecam on the bottom. I don't have my facecam plugged in. Do it. I- I can't.
[14495.74s -> 14497.74s]  No, we need, like, a picture of Super Mario.
[14498.14s -> 14504.54s]  Man, this actually feels really good on the 3DS. Something I was, uh,
[14505.18s -> 14506.86s]  kind of shocked to see.
[14506.86s -> 14512.54s]  You know, I've been in games journalism for a long time, but man, the 3DS version, this does hold up.
[14513.50s -> 14515.98s]  This is a clean, uh, 60 fps.
[14516.70s -> 14529.24s]  Put a one minute delayed video of Just Cause on the bottom.
[14530.89s -> 14533.53s]  No, no, no, no. Guys, what are you- what are you talking about here? Hold on.
[14534.33s -> 14538.01s]  Why you just- excuse me. If this was- if this was not a fucking bullshit joke.
[14539.90s -> 14541.42s]  Print screen, please.
[14541.42s -> 14552.01s]  This is- the map is down there. If you- if this is gonna be legitimate, I mean, it's gotta be legitimate then.
[14552.49s -> 14566.01s]  Okay, let me just open up paint.
[14566.01s -> 14566.97s]  All right.
[14566.97s -> 14573.05s]  Too bad. I can't just, like, record.
[14575.42s -> 14582.17s]  Me. No, that's gonna- that would take so long. Okay, save as PNG. That looks fine.
[14588.60s -> 14601.38s]  We're gonna have to shrink this a little more. Okay, how does that look?
[14609.50s -> 14632.17s]  It's a little skewed. It's because this is tilted, so it doesn't fit that well. I need to angle it. I can't.
[14640.15s -> 14643.18s]  Tilt it in paint?
[14643.18s -> 14648.58s]  You- I can tilt that in paint. What? How the fuck do you do that?
[14659.21s -> 14661.61s]  Free transform it into a trapezoid.
[14667.90s -> 14672.04s]  The skew tool?
[14672.04s -> 14684.28s]  Skew? I see rotate, resize, crop, resize.
[14684.98s -> 14688.10s]  Skew? What?
[14688.12s -> 14707.21s]  Skew it- how many degrees? Like 10? No, minus five. Vertical? We should go vertical, right? So we need a
[14708.01s -> 14718.63s]  vertical skew of, like, five. That kind of fucks it all up, though. What about this at five?
[14718.95s -> 14725.66s]  No, that's kind of fucked up looking.
[14729.48s -> 14743.88s]  Uh, no, that doesn't work. Can I skew an OBS? Let's see. I don't think I can.
[14744.44s -> 14760.12s]  Maybe filter?
[14760.12s -> 14768.95s]  No. No, that's just the way it is. Just gonna have to be like this. Just use the 2DS.
[14769.19s -> 14785.62s]  Oops-a-daisy. Well, it's just gonna have to be like this. Shift and grab. No, shift grab just does that. It's all right.
[14786.02s -> 14812.78s]  Close enough. Wait, oh, I need hands, too, though. What the fuck? Okay, hold on. Save image.
[14815.11s -> 14817.85s]  Hand.
[14817.85s -> 14820.41s]  Run the desktop. That's fine. Okay, hold on.
[14821.13s -> 14824.97s]  Oh fuck, it's not keyed out, though. No, it's not gonna work. Never mind.
[14832.46s -> 14834.46s]  Never mind. It's too much.
[14837.53s -> 14847.72s]  What did I just do? Oh, did I just delete it? Did I just, like, exit the game?
[14857.22s -> 14860.42s]  Uh, this is very hard to play this, but let's play. Here we go.
[14864.33s -> 14882.55s]  Holy fuck, I actually got it. He play looking at OBS? No, I'm playing on the big screen that looks like
[14884.17s -> 14886.81s]  it's this so much aliasing. It's unbelievable.
[14887.53s -> 14898.82s]  Now, let's go do a mission. Is it so hard to point this? I don't even know what the cursor is.
[14917.13s -> 14923.91s]  Watch it. 160p for the authentic experience. I need to pick a mission.
[14926.41s -> 14928.89s]  Uh, here's one. I can't read that.
[14929.85s -> 14931.85s]  Let me try as hard as I can.
[14931.93s -> 14938.09s]  Agency distress beacon. An agency distress signal has pinged
[14938.73s -> 14941.61s]  who grappling hook over since
[14942.41s -> 14945.14s]  the
[14945.14s -> 14946.92s]  stufafone at
[14946.92s -> 14948.78s]  Ilapa
[14948.78s -> 14951.59s]  That can't be
[14951.89s -> 14953.11s]  evidence
[14953.11s -> 14955.30s]  loves
[14955.30s -> 14957.86s]  When the source of the beacon
[14958.58s -> 14968.73s]  All right, you got it. Why am I? What happened to my momentum? Oh
[14969.90s -> 14973.34s]  Where's my fucking momentum? Whatever
[14976.49s -> 14984.63s]  Okay, that was odd. Can I get on your car or is it not gonna let me do this?
[14986.47s -> 14990.79s]  Right, okay that you know, sure i'll take this one that sounds like a fun place that sounds good
[14991.59s -> 14995.43s]  Like the real the 3ds port really is like just a little too buggy for me. I think
[14996.15s -> 15013.58s]  Gotta go this way
[15013.58s -> 15015.58s]  Turn on music
[15018.62s -> 15026.50s]  The game honestly looks better like this, uh, I'm gonna I'm gonna send a disagree here
[15031.51s -> 15046.39s]  That's not authentic though. Hold on. Give me one more second because that's not authentic. It's about to be though
[15047.91s -> 15053.32s]  Okay, um
[15053.32s -> 15055.94s]  We need
[15055.94s -> 15063.11s]  one of these
[15063.35s -> 15079.19s]  Hold on a second. Let's see how that sounds
[15080.89s -> 15083.29s]  Another a little bit here. Hold on
[15086.02s -> 15087.75s]  Okay
[15087.75s -> 15089.75s]  Tell me how that changes things
[15089.83s -> 15125.27s]  Wow
[15125.27s -> 15131.69s]  Go worse. I need I need to know what that sounds like man. Hold on. What did that sound like?
[15134.63s -> 15141.88s]  See how that sounds. I'm not gonna put this loud. I just need to know what it sounded like
[15142.44s -> 15154.46s]  Okay
[15155.18s -> 15156.86s]  It was just
[15156.86s -> 15158.86s]  It didn't change anything
[15159.94s -> 15161.94s]  It didn't change fucking anything. It just made it
[15162.96s -> 15175.96s]  Extremely loud. Hold on. That's why
[15183.94s -> 15194.30s]  Okay, let's see what that does. Is that different? Does that sound different?
[15204.68s -> 15210.50s]  The link what do you mean the link? What do you want for the link? What are you guys linking me?
[15214.31s -> 15217.11s]  Somebody just did it somebody made it
[15219.51s -> 15221.51s]  Why
[15224.31s -> 15229.30s]  Uh
[15230.26s -> 15241.03s]  Well, hold on
[15241.03s -> 15244.31s]  All right. Well, let's get rid of everything else but this
[15261.03s -> 15262.78s]  Oh my god
[15262.78s -> 15265.02s]  How's that a little bit more down?
[15269.61s -> 15275.05s]  That looks pretty good. Maybe a little bit up and to the right
[15281.69s -> 15287.16s]  How does this sound?
[15287.16s -> 15291.00s]  Cap it to 30 frames a second. Oh my god. I don't think I can
[15293.21s -> 15301.08s]  I don't think I can do that
[15301.08s -> 15305.43s]  Scale resolution. Hold on. I don't think I can do that
[15306.07s -> 15310.01s]  filters
[15310.01s -> 15318.10s]  Scaling aspect ratio. I can do it in obs but i'm gonna have to turn the stream off
[15319.42s -> 15328.41s]  Set my monitor's refresh rate to 30 do it in the game
[15329.85s -> 15334.78s]  Do it turn i'm not gonna turn the bit rate down on the stream
[15339.54s -> 15341.54s]  No, let me just wait
[15355.50s -> 15359.26s]  I think you seriously underestimate how I how much I cannot see what's going on on the screen
[15367.56s -> 15370.68s]  Now if this is authentic though, I have to play a little differently. You know what i'm saying?
[15381.45s -> 15383.45s]  Oh fucking jesus. Let me do this
[15389.78s -> 15391.78s]  Oh my god
[15392.87s -> 15431.22s]  Fuck this i'm out of here. I have to use the actual controller. I don't know the controls
[15432.04s -> 15440.66s]  What are the controls? Oh use tilt controls
[15442.68s -> 15449.00s]  One of the crazy things about this is uh that i'm what is that? Oh, I don't have any more bullets
[15457.06s -> 15463.08s]  All right. I figured out how to use the uh, okay hold
[15463.64s -> 15469.62s]  Hold what I can't even see what that says left trigger. I don't know what that even says right trigger
[15469.94s -> 15476.82s]  How's the battery battery low?
[15509.88s -> 15530.52s]  Really, come on. I thought it was already keyed out. It that they already had the channel gone. Whatever keep it
[15530.60s -> 15536.02s]  No, it has to be authentic. All right
[15536.10s -> 15538.98s]  I don't know how much more longer I can take this before my eyes actually start to hurt
[15539.14s -> 15563.93s]  All right, I'm gonna go back to the the controls. I know how to use okay comes the end of the joke voice
[15564.33s -> 15577.05s]  I'll do something at back before though. I promise i'm gonna do something fucking epic read chat
[15577.77s -> 15581.85s]  No, I
[15581.85s -> 15589.99s]  Another link chats going too fast. I can't click. What is this?
[15592.22s -> 15594.46s]  Is this supposed to be in my office?
[15596.20s -> 15602.42s]  This is my office. How many more layers is gonna are we gonna add to this?

[15674.31s -> 15678.07s]  No
[15678.07s -> 15685.74s]  Take a picture of your desk have to make the screen dirty
[15689.30s -> 15696.50s]  I like that idea. All right, i'm gonna get like a transparency of like dirty screen dirty dirty window a dirty screen
[15696.98s -> 15711.62s]  Does it add like smears on it? All right, I think I can do I can work with this
[15713.83s -> 15725.74s]  Add a crack in it too. It's gonna be broken. Oh, here we go. This is perfect
[15727.93s -> 15734.42s]  But how am I I gotta i'm gonna have to do like transparency with this. Let me see if I can get this to work
[15734.98s -> 15741.16s]  Okay, did that work? Let's see if I can get this screen dirty
[15754.52s -> 15758.74s]  Hold on. I didn't need to
[15761.06s -> 15763.69s]  I need to turn the opacity down
[15770.89s -> 15778.04s]  Opacity
[15778.04s -> 15793.70s]  Hold on. It's that's really dirty. What the fuck did I just put it right here properties?
[15794.26s -> 15801.18s]  I gotta go into like

[15825.82s -> 15831.69s]  Um
[15838.18s -> 15839.70s]  It's so dirty
[15839.70s -> 15856.58s]  It's really really too dirty. I think is that too dirty capacity is at like 75
[15861.37s -> 15870.22s]  That's like fucking puke man. That's that is so dirty. Somebody just dropped it in the mud and put a reflection of my face
[15870.86s -> 15872.86s]  Oh for the love of god

[15920.38s -> 15922.36s]  Okay, hold on
[15922.36s -> 15924.36s]  I gotta add that as a source now
[15937.77s -> 15985.96s]  Okay, this will be worth it when it's done right like right here. Okay. Okay
[15986.52s -> 16036.87s]  Let me get I need to key this out now. Jesus. This is gonna be fucking so hard. How's that?

[16317.11s -> 16322.95s]  This is I don't even know what the fuck is down here. We're almost close to perfect
[16327.32s -> 16329.32s]  Okay, here's the game

[16940.38s -> 16941.42s]  3d
[16941.42s -> 16952.25s]  All right. I'm out. That was fun. I'm done with this. It's impossible. I can't play like this
[16962.92s -> 16972.87s]  My 3ds is off. My 3ds is broken though. Sorry guys. It's the webcam mic. It shouldn't be

[16982.20s -> 16984.20s]  Son take better care
[16984.44s -> 16987.18s]  Can I have your 3ds, please? I'm sorry
[16988.14s -> 17009.11s]  Broke my 3ds
[17009.19s -> 17025.74s]  Two 3ds's are you serious? What's in there? Oh my god
[17026.62s -> 17048.23s]  It's just cause it's too far. There's like four 3ds's in this house. How do I go back to normal?
[17048.92s -> 17057.88s]  Is it even possible takes the resolution so you can play but please keep the 3ds overlay
[17058.12s -> 17062.44s]  Why do you want the 3ds overlay? It's the it's impossible to watch
[17073.67s -> 17076.23s]  It's just a lie. It's not even real
[17077.82s -> 17080.31s]  Hold on. I let
[17080.31s -> 17083.19s]  The dirt on the screen. Let me at least be able to see what i'm doing
[17093.02s -> 17095.02s]  Wait, we're on the webcam
[17095.82s -> 17101.06s]  Why are we on the webcam mic? That's not the webcam
[17101.62s -> 17105.77s]  Oh, you want to be on the webcam mic. I see what you're saying
[17106.65s -> 17115.48s]  I get it
[17125.72s -> 17129.26s]  Okay, i'm a secret agent
[17129.98s -> 17147.76s]  Oh
[17151.16s -> 17153.32s]  This game's actually really really good though
[17155.56s -> 17159.82s]  It's got mostly negative on steam. I don't I don't know
[17160.80s -> 17170.52s]  Maybe it's because it's not on 3ds like this is I mean, that's probably why
[17171.77s -> 17173.77s]  Because it's not in the 3ds
[17181.66s -> 17187.15s]  keyboard
[17187.15s -> 17189.07s]  And that and that's it
[17189.07s -> 17196.72s]  And that's it
[17196.72s -> 17200.48s]  Immersion is we're done. We're done with this. That was a lot of fun
[17203.50s -> 17205.82s]  Now i'm gonna go back to playing just cause 4
[17207.69s -> 17212.89s]  I mean, we how this has been like a fucking hour. We've been doing this for an hour
[17222.97s -> 17224.97s]  No, i'm not turning the stream off
[17229.56s -> 17231.80s]  Don't let the photoshop go to waste
[17237.13s -> 17242.09s]  Some guy gave hands to you and you're whose hands are those though? I don't know whose those are
[17248.72s -> 17250.16s]  What happened?
[17250.16s -> 17254.06s]  Why did that happen?
[17254.06s -> 17256.06s]  They're yours
[17260.59s -> 17269.72s]  All right, I need to go back to normal that was fucking that was a lot of fun
[17270.20s -> 17273.34s]  But I need to put this back into 1080
[17275.36s -> 17276.48s]  before I
[17276.48s -> 17283.04s]  Literally lose my mind
[17283.04s -> 17286.16s]  So tomorrow we're gonna be streaming the game awards if you didn't know
[17286.72s -> 17298.49s]  Should be fun. I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. Why does everybody think i'm leaving?
[17299.80s -> 17307.47s]  I can't say well, okay, but until people just think i'm gonna leave the stream. Well, that doesn't look right
[17308.03s -> 17312.33s]  This looks completely wrong
[17312.33s -> 17315.13s]  Okay, well, let's try maybe this will fix it
[17315.85s -> 17320.54s]  Hey, look at that. Wow. This feels very strange
[17321.10s -> 17323.10s]  This is this feels incorrect
[17324.30s -> 17336.60s]  I really feel like this feels wrong. Okay. Yeah game awards are gonna be streaming it. We're gonna. Oh, we're gonna talk about it
[17338.06s -> 17340.06s]  All right, let me give me this car
[17340.14s -> 17350.94s]  Actually, I want a bike. Well, I missed the bike like an idiot
[17354.56s -> 17356.88s]  All right, how far away is that start agency district?
[17360.78s -> 17363.74s]  What the fuck? Why is there a tank here?
[17366.96s -> 17372.73s]  Why am I still alive?
[17372.73s -> 17374.81s]  Who's playing a fucking rts right now?
[17378.88s -> 17387.26s]  Do they think that's me? I guess still alive. He's still trying to drive the car
[17393.50s -> 17394.46s]  Okay
[17394.46s -> 17396.46s]  Well, not anymore. It seems
[17401.15s -> 17403.15s]  Oh my god with the cycles
[17407.60s -> 17409.60s]  Destroy the bridge. Okay. Fine. Watch this
[17410.84s -> 17414.72s]  You can you can do that. You actually can I thought you kidding
[17420.54s -> 17433.07s]  Okay, I gotta get down there this way. How far away is this place?
[17433.87s -> 17442.91s]  Actually, not that far you can get there a little lickety split. All right, let me try not to
[17443.90s -> 17448.99s]  I said that and I almost did it
[17448.99s -> 17451.95s]  I'm so used to playing this on the 3ds that I forget how to play control the game
[17469.79s -> 17472.75s]  No, we're pretty far away. I can I like a guy can get some speed here
[17475.08s -> 17477.52s]  There we go. I finally figured it out
[17481.92s -> 17483.92s]  Now i'm moving fast now i'll move it fast
[17488.72s -> 17490.72s]  Yeah
[17494.25s -> 17496.01s]  Yeah
[17496.01s -> 17504.88s]  Yeah
[17504.88s -> 17506.88s]  Very fast. Hooray
[17510.14s -> 17513.50s]  You just it's transitioning between the two of them that makes it easier like that
[17529.21s -> 17532.33s]  What what do you get why is everybody making the I made this face
[17536.20s -> 17539.32s]  Everything I love this stream. Why is I made this?
[17542.94s -> 17544.94s]  Oh for the love of god, okay
[17555.12s -> 17566.19s]  Well, that was uh, okay that looks a little better right? Yeah. Okay. We're fine. Hey, hi i'm back
[17571.98s -> 17579.08s]  How long that must have been on there the whole time. It's all right. Did I go buy it? No, it's right here
[17582.38s -> 17586.30s]  Go back to the webcam the mic the webcam mic is not still on
[17586.70s -> 17604.65s]  I just want to get up to the top of the mountain. Oh the game audio too. Fuck
[17606.27s -> 17610.27s]  I forgot there's a shit little filters on this. There's so many the game
[17610.75s -> 17613.31s]  Okay now you should it shouldn't be insane
[17619.00s -> 17630.97s]  What a terrible fucking stream that would have been webcam mic and a bunch of filters on the audio stream is now ruined
[17631.21s -> 17636.28s]  And
[17636.28s -> 17643.45s]  Why would you do something like that? Thank god. I didn't kick the goat in the head
[17644.80s -> 17647.20s]  Okay, we're gonna do a mission. Hey, would you look at that?
[17647.84s -> 17651.74s]  Hey look a mission guys
[17651.74s -> 17659.72s]  Can you believe it?
[17659.72s -> 17662.51s]  Tom sheldon
[17662.51s -> 17664.91s]  Well, I guess you got my message. Yeah
[17665.55s -> 17669.76s]  He's all cleared me up. I'm on my way. Who's that?
[17671.79s -> 17673.79s]  Why are you here sheldon?
[17673.79s -> 17679.47s]  When you went dark after medici, I figured i'd look through some of your old files see where you might end up
[17680.43s -> 17686.51s]  It turns out your dad is working with us. He has a really really great something called project
[17690.35s -> 17692.35s]  That's like tinsel
[17694.43s -> 17696.43s]  Talk of weather modification technology
[17699.31s -> 17705.55s]  Did I turn the graphics back right looking at those eopah files I ended up on administrative leave
[17707.32s -> 17710.28s]  I guess i'm not the only one who doesn't trust tom sheldon
[17710.84s -> 17713.40s]  Maybe I didn't know you're looking to take out eopah rico
[17714.12s -> 17716.44s]  I've already done some of the legwork fake snow
[17717.95s -> 17719.95s]  You screwed me over more than once in medici
[17720.97s -> 17725.69s]  I don't want your help sheldon. Well, you're gonna need man. This looks much better on the 3ds. I agree
[17728.56s -> 17732.40s]  Turns out that place is constantly surrounded by a nasty lightning storm
[17733.36s -> 17735.36s]  Uh fried poor annabelle here
[17736.08s -> 17741.31s]  That seems pretty suspicious to have a standing lightning storm like that. Don't you think?
[17745.42s -> 17747.42s]  Is a friend of yours rico?
[17747.82s -> 17749.52s]  Not exactly
[17749.52s -> 17755.44s]  Nira malales, she's tom sheldon. I'm sorry for the mouth. There's nothing I can do about it. He cannot be trusted
[17756.68s -> 17761.00s]  Buenos don't listen to this guy senorita pleased to meet you
[17761.96s -> 17765.72s]  Rico and I were just discussing the situation with zona dose and you know
[17767.00s -> 17770.20s]  Like a mouse in my coffee for a second. It's an ice cube. I did
[17772.68s -> 17776.20s]  Okay, this is a very cool, I can't wait to understand the story
[17784.36s -> 17791.88s]  All right, hold on is the water is a beard made out of water
[17807.37s -> 17812.75s]  Look better. That looks kind of all right
[17818.16s -> 17820.16s]  Apply the 3ds settings
[17820.56s -> 17821.52s]  Yeah
[17821.52s -> 17822.96s]  I need
[17822.96s -> 17824.96s]  I need sasau
[17825.60s -> 17827.60s]  I don't think I don't need to turn on sasau
[17833.15s -> 17834.99s]  Now do max settings
[17834.99s -> 17836.99s]  No, I don't like the way games look with max settings
[17837.98s -> 17839.98s]  They look overproduced
[17845.77s -> 17848.65s]  You know why there's a lot of your favorite first person shooter?
[17849.43s -> 17854.25s]  Streamers play on low settings because of all the lights and graphics and illuminations
[17854.33s -> 17857.55s]  No, it's easier to play a game and see when it's not on like maximum settings
[17866.78s -> 17881.21s]  Yes, it is type in professional counter-strike player low graphics and you tell me what you find come on
[17881.21s -> 17883.21s]  On
[17883.21s -> 17896.76s]  Damn it. I didn't get it
[17896.76s -> 17901.56s]  Yes, you need to type in professional counter-strike player graphics settings
[17907.40s -> 17916.73s]  Why did that guy do it like that? It's rolling. He's right
[17917.53s -> 17920.57s]  I know that people play on low graphics so they can see the game better
[17922.19s -> 17925.47s]  Just type in computer professional counter-strike graphics
[17926.27s -> 17927.45s]  commands
[17927.45s -> 17929.45s]  professional csgo player
[17929.47s -> 17938.36s]  All right, what a mission am I gonna do before I like turn off the stream? How about that one?
[17941.55s -> 17944.67s]  Now just go open with the google search and type in your computer type in
[17947.23s -> 17954.03s]  What should I put my graphic settings on if i'm going to play professional counter-strike? What is a pro player's setup?
[17954.11s -> 17956.59s]  Do they use low settings type that in your computer?
[17957.63s -> 17978.12s]  How do you use turbo jump turbo jump? Oh, no jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
[17982.16s -> 17983.84s]  Did it bounce
[17983.84s -> 17986.40s]  No, it's turned to shit. Okay, whatever
[17986.56s -> 17987.76s]  Oh
[17987.76s -> 17991.60s]  He's my grenade launcher sick
[17992.32s -> 17994.32s]  Dude, thanks for the fucking heads up man
[17994.88s -> 18008.08s]  I need this
[18008.08s -> 18021.88s]  Keep at it people
[18022.12s -> 18061.98s]  Am I still alive?
[18063.42s -> 18077.00s]  Hey, did you hear the song that's why we're next to a bad guy
[18078.81s -> 18080.81s]  What the heck is spawning right to a bad guy?
[18081.61s -> 18083.61s]  What the heck?
[18084.60s -> 18086.92s]  Get out of here. You're gonna hear a bad guy
[18088.04s -> 18114.22s]  All right, let's go
[18127.76s -> 18130.40s]  I want to do one more thing before I

[18216.83s -> 18219.84s]  Damn it. Just put on the damn suit
[18225.29s -> 18227.77s]  It's a friendly jet. None of them are friendly
[18237.36s -> 18240.36s]  I gotta get up there
[18246.48s -> 18250.06s]  And oh not quite
[18253.98s -> 18258.76s]  I can't get there
[18261.16s -> 18263.16s]  Okay, so let's get up here
[18266.38s -> 18268.59s]  into the ship
[18268.59s -> 18270.43s]  Destroy the airship
[18270.43s -> 18272.43s]  Now that's gonna be very easy enough
[18274.48s -> 18279.76s]  Okay, so guys, thanks for uh coming to stream and away we go
[18283.42s -> 18285.79s]  No, shoot the

[18310.96s -> 18314.60s]  I want to get on that. How do I get
[18316.57s -> 18332.57s]  Get inside of it. What the fuck is happening to my character right now?
[18372.89s -> 18375.58s]  All right, where's the blimp it's all the way up there
[18382.08s -> 18384.08s]  It's so high up at this point
[18384.89s -> 18391.60s]  How am I supposed to get up there?
[18392.56s -> 18395.69s]  Just go really hot. How am I supposed to get up there?

[18415.24s -> 18417.24s]  I'm gonna do the floaty
[18423.74s -> 18425.74s]  Okay, now here's the theory can I
[18426.70s -> 18428.30s]  Get on top of this

[19300.80s -> 19307.13s]  I don't know. Maybe i'll play it again
[19311.34s -> 19313.58s]  I want the 3ds version. It's probably pretty good
[19316.80s -> 19319.10s]  so tomorrow

[19355.84s -> 19357.44s]  But thanks for sticking around
[19357.44s -> 19360.40s]  Just wanted to check out just cause for which i've had fun
[19361.66s -> 19366.68s]  I had fun. It was a fun game, but a little on the uh, a little on the weird side
[19368.28s -> 19370.30s]  Wait 12. What do you mean?
[19370.30s -> 19374.54s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait 12. Hold on a second. Hold on. Let me make sure we get this right before I get out of here
[19378.81s -> 19380.57s]  I I don't think that's correct
[19380.57s -> 19383.05s]  12 pst. No, it's got to be later than that
[19388.54s -> 19390.30s]  game awards
[19390.30s -> 19397.13s]  The game awards are
[19397.27s -> 19398.97s]  5 30 pst
[19398.97s -> 19402.00s]  Okay
[19402.00s -> 19408.84s]  So at 5 30 pst is when the stream's gonna be tomorrow and we're just gonna have fun
[19409.85s -> 19412.41s]  There'll be a face cam there, you know
[19412.57s -> 19422.94s]  Maybe if I feel like turning it on but yeah, uh, let's get to the bits
[19423.42s -> 19426.72s]  Let's put the outro on the screen. Thanks for sticking around
[19427.52s -> 19430.33s]  Hope you had a good time. I did
[19430.33s -> 19433.05s]  And I I did burp a few times on stream, but it's okay
[19435.95s -> 19442.03s]  And let's bring ourselves back to just under five and a half hours ago
[19444.44s -> 19447.16s]  We had three dollars from divas. Thank you divas with three bucks
[19447.80s -> 19454.25s]  Mostly lost gave one dollar. The reason I was tilted earlier is because you always go live five minutes before I need to leave
[19454.81s -> 19463.42s]  I'm sorry about that. You know, I'm sorry about that
[19466.35s -> 19468.35s]  That's the real end of the stream voice. Yeah, that is
[19468.99s -> 19477.71s]  But thank you mostly lost but the two dollars total here obviously you need to operate on my schedule and you can't go live until I say
[19477.71s -> 19482.24s]  So it's very difficult. I will tell you
[19482.88s -> 19485.18s]  Especially being on pacific time now. It's
[19485.82s -> 19488.44s]  When you're on pst, you have to remember
[19489.24s -> 19491.24s]  You're essentially back in time
[19491.98s -> 19493.02s]  because
[19493.02s -> 19495.37s]  noon pacific
[19495.37s -> 19497.37s]  Or even like 10 a.m pacific
[19498.17s -> 19500.17s]  Is 10 11 12 1
[19500.89s -> 19503.77s]  2 3 4 5 6 it's like 6 or 7 o'clock eu
[19504.75s -> 19508.91s]  If I got up at like 9 in the morning and streamed at 9 in the morning it'd be like 5 o'clock in the afternoon
[19510.49s -> 19517.23s]  That's kind of insane
[19517.23s -> 19519.92s]  Sorry if time zones
[19520.00s -> 19523.92s]  Uh screw up your viewing habits. I'm sorry that it's like that

[19559.79s -> 19563.07s]  I think we got fun out of this. Maybe we didn't get 60 dollars worth of fun
[19563.15s -> 19566.83s]  No, maybe I don't know we got like we got like at least 17 dollars worth of fun
[19568.80s -> 19573.28s]  If I had you know, if I keep playing it the next couple days and maybe i'll get like 41 dollars of fun
[19573.92s -> 19580.97s]  I'm, not sure
[19580.97s -> 19582.97s]  60 dollars for a 3ds game
[19585.05s -> 19587.23s]  It's kind of ridiculous, isn't it?
[19588.32s -> 19591.28s]  Uh, thank you freddy c for the two bucks. They just say beautiful. Thank you
[19592.24s -> 19596.00s]  Sly 161. Thanks for the one dollar. Hey germa. I know chat didn't really like watching it

[19607.52s -> 19609.10s]  and
[19609.10s -> 19612.78s]  A lot of you guys were acting as if I was just blowing a fire alarm through your speakers
[19613.50s -> 19619.60s]  Like I had to turn that off. It was a bullhorn next to a fire alarm
[19620.08s -> 19629.10s]  It was bad. I don't know
[19629.10s -> 19635.34s]  Okay, the only I I have like at least three times where i've looked over and been like why is everybody so fucking angry?

[19652.38s -> 19655.13s]  Everybody's very mad right now
[19662.91s -> 19664.91s]  Yeah, I did two octogen streams
[19664.99s -> 19676.36s]  That's the only two times I think I could really pinpoint when I would it was just like well people are very angry with me

[19698.16s -> 19700.40s]  But I just spent the last of my grocery money on these bits
[19700.96s -> 19704.64s]  And i'm gonna starve to the winter if I don't hear you say the magic words, please please
[19705.28s -> 19707.37s]  uh

[19742.86s -> 19745.90s]  No, this is not even at the 3ds bit. This is before that
[19747.74s -> 19751.18s]  I don't know. I that looked okay except for christmas beard
[19751.90s -> 19757.60s]  It was a little janky and ugly
[19758.32s -> 19760.88s]  There was a lot of aliasing and it was very bright
[19761.60s -> 19768.97s]  Actually, it did look pretty bad. You're right. Never mind, but thank you though
[19769.69s -> 19772.33s]  Uh, thank you freudian weapon for these six dollars

[19854.68s -> 19862.96s]  I would say how much I love your content for your four years ago is when I started though. It's a long time
[19865.04s -> 19869.82s]  Thank you for being here for this long. It's weird because
[19870.46s -> 19874.57s]  The 10 year is going to be coming up here in a couple of years
[19875.82s -> 19879.10s]  Just over two and a half years, right?
[19879.10s -> 19881.10s]  Once we hit 2020
[19881.84s -> 19883.84s]  That would be because I started in 2011
[19884.48s -> 19892.06s]  So we're talking about only another two to three years before that's that's a full decade that i've been doing youtube and twitch
[19892.78s -> 19896.43s]  What am I going to do for the 10 year anniversary?

[19939.79s -> 19943.87s]  I have to say that the other night is some of the most fun i've had on your stream not only watching but just interacting
[19944.43s -> 19950.43s]  Nearly 12 000 viewers. I've never seen a better group of chatters on this site. I love being here. It's always a great experience
[19952.94s -> 19954.30s]  Yeah that
[19954.30s -> 19957.50s]  That was wild
[19957.50s -> 19959.98s]  Never never before have I ever had that many people here
[19961.40s -> 19965.88s]  The last germa wrestling thing was just about 10 000 and then that was about 12 000
[19966.60s -> 19967.48s]  like
[19967.48s -> 19971.00s]  In the last week i've never seen anything like that before

[20274.88s -> 20277.12s]  Thank you flug boy for the one dollar
[20277.12s -> 20280.24s]  I hope you're doing all right germ just want to say the green screen movie night by my entire rest of the year
[20280.64s -> 20285.36s]  It was great. I also hope we didn't ruin any chances of you wanting to watch jojo

[20290.17s -> 20292.81s]  I told you 2019 the one anime is gonna be jojo

[20307.15s -> 20311.28s]  Uh, but thank you garfield the monday killer for the one dollar
[20312.00s -> 20315.20s]  Garfield thought of a strange scenario if there was a week-long purge
[20315.84s -> 20318.40s]  Who are two guys you would trust to protect you?
[20319.62s -> 20325.08s]  Stipulation you can pick fictional characters. They can't have any superpowers. So batman would be allowed
[20325.56s -> 20327.56s]  But he can only use gadgets
[20329.00s -> 20331.00s]  They're not capable of turning against you
[20331.56s -> 20333.96s]  So if you hire the joker, he can only protect you
[20335.44s -> 20338.56s]  Garfield would choose mr. Rogers and pooh bear
[20339.20s -> 20342.01s]  Okay
[20342.01s -> 20343.55s]  Um
[20343.55s -> 20346.84s]  And that's very easy
[20346.84s -> 20347.80s]  God
[20347.80s -> 20352.03s]  Wait, is god of super be a good hold on. Wait. No that no, I don't know. Um
[20352.99s -> 20363.98s]  What I picked to protect me, you know, I would I would pick garfield i'd pick garfield
[20365.23s -> 20369.33s]  And man would we get ourselves in some real dangerous situations?
[20385.60s -> 20391.84s]  You know, I picked garfield and like garfield it's like a fucking 100 people coming to get me get out there
[20393.44s -> 20395.44s]  Yeah, go get them
[20395.52s -> 20397.52s]  There's a hundred of them go get them
[20397.85s -> 20403.98s]  You gotta protect me
[20403.98s -> 20407.82s]  And the second person I would pick because garfield would it would would just be destroyed in a second
[20408.38s -> 20410.38s]  Uh, the second person would be
[20411.18s -> 20418.83s]  um
[20418.83s -> 20422.60s]  hmm
[20428.44s -> 20432.80s]  Doesn't have superpowers
[20435.39s -> 20437.39s]  It'd have to be somebody huge
[20437.47s -> 20440.11s]  That's really fast. That's really strong
[20440.75s -> 20444.22s]  All right. Can I pick can I pick like the mountain from game of thrones?
[20444.78s -> 20455.13s]  Does it mean that's like
[20455.45s -> 20457.45s]  Okay, so it'd be garfield and then the mountain
[20461.80s -> 20467.24s]  Somebody would just shoot him. But this is a world with no guns, right? It's just who do you whatever?
[20468.12s -> 20470.12s]  That okay. I would pick a guy that had a gun
[20471.66s -> 20477.08s]  And it was very good at it. I'd pick like 47 or something
[20480.73s -> 20482.73s]  A gun is not a superpower
[20486.88s -> 20489.20s]  Thank you garfield. Thank you captain worgen for the one dollar

[20548.70s -> 20552.14s]  Which is nearly fucking 100 percent impossible
[20553.58s -> 20555.15s]  so
[20555.15s -> 20557.77s]  Take that with what you will I guess

[20632.96s -> 20637.13s]  I think it might be broken
[20637.13s -> 20639.13s]  Is it just in a constant never-ending loop?

[20843.96s -> 20846.52s]  I must have done something real stupid
[20847.32s -> 20852.12s]  There was a point there in the middle of that
[20852.44s -> 20854.94s]  before the ds bit
[20856.30s -> 20859.26s]  I I think i've ran into the ground like seven times in a row
[20861.72s -> 20865.88s]  Thank you springfield for the two dollars fifty cents. Hey germa. I've been wondering for my entire life
[20866.52s -> 20871.32s]  What happened to the gift of flight video? It's my favorite video of all time and it's gone missing what gives
[20872.60s -> 20874.60s]  I've explained it a few times before
[20874.84s -> 20877.32s]  But there was a point when I was trying to clean up the channel
[20878.28s -> 20879.24s]  of
[20879.24s -> 20880.74s]  terrible
[20880.74s -> 20883.72s]  13 and seven fucking call of duty kill confirm videos
[20884.52s -> 20888.60s]  That I just hated I was like, I don't want this on the chin and I went through and I was checking boxes
[20889.08s -> 20891.08s]  And I was like wait, what's this?
[20891.48s -> 20893.72s]  And some of them just got checked that I shouldn't have checked
[20895.45s -> 20898.25s]  There was a period where I don't know man. Like I got they get to a point where
[20899.13s -> 20901.53s]  There was somebody like videos that I wanted the channel to be more
[20902.15s -> 20906.83s]  Focused and I was like embarrassed that people could go back and watch
[20907.39s -> 20911.79s]  Some of those terrible fucking videos where I literally just played call of duty for like eight minutes
[20912.67s -> 20914.67s]  And uploaded whatever fucking happened
[20914.99s -> 20921.63s]  And I only did that like five times so ten times maybe total of the nearly thousand videos that I uploaded on that channel
[20922.67s -> 20924.43s]  so
[20924.43s -> 20927.55s]  You know, I I mean I was starting to get a little bit more viewership
[20927.95s -> 20933.15s]  I was making content that I like to make more than something like that and people were going to go back at the beginning
[20933.23s -> 20936.19s]  Of the channel and oh no, here's like what's what are these videos?
[20936.27s -> 20940.11s]  I'm going to watch these and be like, well, never mind. Let me unsubscribe this guy. I don't like this
[20941.07s -> 20952.72s]  So it would get caught in the crossfires of me trying to clean the channel up
[20953.44s -> 20955.44s]  Of like stuff that I thought was bad
[20956.24s -> 20958.43s]  bad as in
[20958.43s -> 20960.43s]  Like not good to watch
[20960.97s -> 20963.61s]  But sorry that some of those videos were removed
[20967.61s -> 20973.08s]  But thank you springfield for the 250. Hopefully that is a that is an explanation
[20974.16s -> 20978.54s]  That you will be okay with hey kairatobi. Thanks for the

[21023.45s -> 21027.13s]  Savior of the dreaming dead. Thanks for the one dollar. How exactly did we get here?
[21028.52s -> 21030.52s]  Um, I turned the graphics down
[21031.07s -> 21032.27s]  all the way
[21032.27s -> 21035.81s]  In just cause and it looked like nintendo 64 or 3ds
[21036.67s -> 21041.47s]  So then it was like this is a 3ds game. Oh, okay. Hold on a second and then it just spiraled out of control
[21041.95s -> 21045.93s]  That's what happened. It's kind of how it went down
[21048.64s -> 21054.96s]  Uh carrot, thank you carrot for the one dollar the fucking 3ds. I can't even type i'm laughing too hard
[21057.82s -> 21060.54s]  Glad you thought it was funny. Thanks for the one dollar, dude
[21061.88s -> 21063.80s]  Hey shoot man. Thank you shoot me for the one dollar
[21063.80s -> 21068.52s]  I feel the need to admit that I watched the green screen movie night for an hour before realizing i'd already seen it
[21069.08s -> 21070.68s]  And it wasn't live
[21070.68s -> 21072.68s]  Thanks for the free content you smooth
[21073.32s -> 21075.39s]  brain stallion
[21075.39s -> 21088.68s]  What thank you
[21088.68s -> 21096.04s]  Thank you to mostly lost for the one dollar. You're the top just cause four streamer on twitch
[21096.84s -> 21104.01s]  By a large margin doesn't I mean that doesn't really surprise me because i'm playing it like three days late
[21105.34s -> 21107.74s]  You know what I mean? Didn't this come out like on monday or something?
[21108.99s -> 21110.99s]  So anyone that was gonna stream it?
[21115.68s -> 21122.70s]  Anyone that was gonna stream it probably already did it right? It came out yesterday. Oh, well
[21126.64s -> 21129.30s]  Three three days yesterday ago
[21129.30s -> 21132.11s]  Oh
[21136.13s -> 21139.44s]  No, that's cool I that's
[21139.84s -> 21141.04s]  Really really?
[21141.04s -> 21149.47s]  I mean, that's a I don't really know what to say, you know being in the top position on any given game is
[21151.34s -> 21154.30s]  This is an honor right because it's like oh, wow. Okay
[21156.02s -> 21157.86s]  That's really cool
[21157.86s -> 21159.86s]  Hopefully people like the stream
[21163.36s -> 21165.36s]  top 3ds streamer
[21165.84s -> 21171.57s]  Maybe thank you mostly lost for the one dollar. You're the top. Whoa. Whoa. I already did that. Just did it
[21171.73s -> 21172.85s]  Just did it
[21172.85s -> 21177.22s]  But thank you mostly lost. Thank you meaty mate for the five dollars meaty matey
[21178.11s -> 21180.11s]  Five bucks here. Thank you so much
[21180.11s -> 21182.75s]  Blue comet. Thanks for the ten dollars. No message
[21183.47s -> 21186.80s]  Just ten bucks. Thanks a lot, dude
[21186.80s -> 21188.80s]  Ten bucks. Thank you
[21193.12s -> 21195.12s]  Pre-recorded stream skip what?
[21196.10s -> 21199.22s]  Uh danda dump. Thanks for the one dollar. I just spent money to tell you
[21199.22s -> 21202.42s]  This is the dumbest joke I think you've ever done keep up the good work
[21203.06s -> 21205.06s]  Just you fucking wait
[21205.98s -> 21208.08s]  Just wait
[21208.08s -> 21214.86s]  I would I would just wait before you say that okay
[21216.00s -> 21219.49s]  That's all I need to say
[21219.49s -> 21220.53s]  but
[21220.53s -> 21222.74s]  I thought it was really fun
[21222.74s -> 21228.34s]  Uh ren, thank you ren for the five dollars. They just say pogchamp pogchamp pogchamp
[21228.98s -> 21234.45s]  Thank you
[21234.45s -> 21236.45s]  Uh, thank you there
[21237.09s -> 21241.57s]  Or there nor there nor for the one dollar top 3ds gamer
[21244.62s -> 21247.90s]  You can you I remember a long time ago. I wanted to capture the 3ds
[21248.78s -> 21250.56s]  and it was
[21250.56s -> 21254.96s]  Nearly impossible you have don't you have to get a separate device from a third party?
[21256.66s -> 21261.14s]  That lets you hook into the hooks in the back of the 3ds and let's you plug it into hdmi or something
[21265.22s -> 21267.48s]  You have to actually mod your 3ds
[21270.34s -> 21276.59s]  I don't think there's anything I really would want to stream on 3ds. Anyways, maybe the warriorware game
[21277.87s -> 21284.03s]  But we already played all the warriorwares a long time ago. That's probably that's really the only thing i'd want to play
[21285.89s -> 21288.56s]  Just use the webcam
[21288.56s -> 21290.56s]  Go back to like 2007 youtube
[21291.55s -> 21294.11s]  Hey dan with wings. Thanks for the ten dollars dan
[21295.82s -> 21299.26s]  Hey, germa just want to let you know that the 3ds bit was the hardest i've laughed in a live stream
[21300.11s -> 21303.95s]  Uh stuff like this is why you're the only streamer I still watch keep it up slugger
[21307.73s -> 21309.90s]  Thank you
[21309.90s -> 21312.94s]  I hope you still think that in another week
[21313.50s -> 21316.14s]  Another day another month another year
[21318.42s -> 21324.18s]  Hope you still have fun. Thank you. Thank you smacklesmore for the one dollar germy
[21324.18s -> 21329.14s]  You're the funniest and most creative streamer and also very handsome. I mean
[21329.78s -> 21331.46s]  Those are those are like three
[21331.46s -> 21334.42s]  Three like super nice adjectives, you know what I mean?
[21339.07s -> 21340.59s]  All I can say is thank you
[21340.59s -> 21348.11s]  Appreciate it. Kyratopia. Thanks for the one dollar. Uh from snowy again in the discord in case the joke ever comes back
[21354.02s -> 21356.02s]  Yeah, it's just like a blank slate
[21356.42s -> 21362.74s]  That's so funny. I'm gonna have to hold on to this because if in case that ever comes back I have a perfect image
[21363.63s -> 21366.91s]  Thank you
[21366.91s -> 21369.71s]  Uh, mr. Wink. Thanks for the dollar 50. They just say
[21370.51s -> 21375.98s]  Who who I think that's the that's like the point two second gnome video, right?
[21376.94s -> 21380.06s]  Uh mostly lost. Thanks for the one dollar. If you went back and looked at all my bit messages
[21380.06s -> 21383.02s]  They probably amount to abuse what?
[21385.06s -> 21388.13s]  No, you're fine. Don't worry
[21392.11s -> 21395.79s]  Uh, thank you jess for the one dollar smash comes out this week any plans on that?
[21397.12s -> 21398.96s]  Um, I think so
[21398.96s -> 21401.86s]  But I don't want I don't want to turn on smash on launch day
[21402.88s -> 21404.16s]  because
[21404.24s -> 21409.04s]  I'd like to unlock the characters and at least get familiar with it before I try to do anything with it
[21413.49s -> 21414.77s]  We'll see
[21414.77s -> 21417.41s]  There is a possibility that you will see smash brothers
[21420.51s -> 21422.51s]  on the channel maybe
[21423.49s -> 21426.93s]  Uh stream the story mode. I don't know if that would be I don't know if that's that interesting though
[21428.53s -> 21430.53s]  It's just kind of fighting against bots
[21431.25s -> 21435.14s]  I'd rather get familiar and then do an actual
[21436.00s -> 21439.86s]  Multiplayer stream where I fucking decimate everybody as pac-man
[21440.58s -> 21454.99s]  We'll see but yeah, that is exciting does come out soon. Thank you though
[21455.63s -> 21460.11s]  Uh maxie kaspersky. Thanks for the one dollar. I'm something of a community sub myself
[21460.67s -> 21463.20s]  Well, they sure have given a lot. So
[21463.20s -> 21468.13s]  Thank you. Jerk tc gave 15 bucks 15 from jerk tc
[21468.21s -> 21471.97s]  I'm here cuddling a kitten and having goosebumps because I like your videos so much
[21472.69s -> 21477.49s]  I'm a huge fan of goosebumps, too
[21478.29s -> 21481.09s]  I especially love the abominable snowman one
[21481.81s -> 21482.93s]  I love
[21482.93s -> 21484.93s]  the um
[21485.17s -> 21487.17s]  Attack of the dummy in the in the attic
[21487.57s -> 21491.70s]  Whatever that one's called
[21491.70s -> 21493.70s]  But in all seriousness, thank you
[21496.27s -> 21499.87s]  I'm very happy that you think that this is worth watching
[21502.59s -> 21504.35s]  I hope I can continue to
[21504.35s -> 21510.00s]  Have you feel that way? Thank you for the 15 dollars. Thank you. Timmy tim tan for the one dollar
[21510.72s -> 21513.39s]  I didn't show up to the date
[21516.11s -> 21520.22s]  A date
[21520.22s -> 21523.60s]  to hello
[21523.60s -> 21529.12s]  Sandy is that you? Yes. Uh-huh. Who's this? It's gil gil gil who
[21529.60s -> 21534.80s]  What do you mean gil who gil dixon, of course? Oh gil dixon. I'm sorry
[21535.28s -> 21539.92s]  Yes, we had a date last night. Where were you? I waited for one hour
[21540.48s -> 21542.64s]  Oh, i'm sorry gil
[21543.28s -> 21545.28s]  I couldn't come
[21545.52s -> 21547.52s]  Couldn't come
[21547.68s -> 21549.36s]  Why not?
[21549.36s -> 21553.28s]  Well, I had to pack my stuff for my trip
[21554.56s -> 21560.96s]  Why didn't you call me? I wanted to call you but um
[21562.08s -> 21567.12s]  I couldn't remember your phone number my trip and now
[21567.84s -> 21570.34s]  I'm going to forget yours
[21573.97s -> 21575.97s]  A date
[21578.66s -> 21584.26s]  What do you mean gil who gil dixon of course
[21585.06s -> 21587.06s]  For one hour
[21587.22s -> 21589.22s]  I waited for one hour
[21590.74s -> 21592.74s]  I just lost yours
[21593.54s -> 21598.58s]  If you want to learn english
[21598.58s -> 21603.97s]  Go check it out
[21603.97s -> 21608.21s]  Thank you timmy tim tan. Thank you up quark for the one dollar. If you had to bring back one old meme
[21608.21s -> 21610.99s]  What would you bring back?
[21610.99s -> 21616.16s]  um
[21616.16s -> 21620.96s]  None of them. I don't think no i'd rather i'd rather see
[21621.84s -> 21623.84s]  And do new stuff
[21625.06s -> 21628.98s]  You know, we can always remember the old ones
[21629.62s -> 21632.29s]  But there's new ones to make
[21632.29s -> 21642.11s]  You understand all your bass are belong to us. No, I don't mean like in in history
[21647.89s -> 21650.61s]  Thank you though clueless sniper. Thanks for the one dollar. Hey germa
[21650.61s -> 21652.77s]  I was wondering if you plan on doing another movie night
[21652.77s -> 21656.53s]  I had a lot of fun making my weather channel video and I hope I have a couple more ideas
[21658.51s -> 21660.51s]  I don't really have a plan
[21660.59s -> 21663.95s]  to do a second one
[21663.95s -> 21664.91s]  but
[21664.91s -> 21666.43s]  I might
[21666.43s -> 21668.91s]  There's a possibility where we could figure out something fun
[21669.97s -> 21673.57s]  Where you have to make something very specific, you know what I mean?
[21674.61s -> 21676.61s]  So instead of just literally anything
[21677.63s -> 21680.91s]  There's maybe like a few different categories you could put it into
[21682.53s -> 21691.98s]  But I don't know this I don't really have like a plan for it certain categories maybe
[21694.24s -> 21698.48s]  But i'm very very happy with what happened and how it turned out and i've seen um
[21699.68s -> 21704.94s]  A lot of people discussing it and i've seen all the people had a lot of fun
[21704.94s -> 21708.30s]  I'm really happy about that. I've also seen a little bit of criticism and I can understand that
[21709.26s -> 21711.12s]  uh
[21711.12s -> 21713.12s]  It was very very difficult
[21714.03s -> 21716.75s]  To because this was never supposed to be a contest, right?
[21718.13s -> 21721.17s]  I wanted to try to include as many people as possible
[21725.46s -> 21727.79s]  because
[21727.79s -> 21729.79s]  If okay, let's say for instance, okay
[21729.79s -> 21734.75s]  Uh, oh there was like seven or eight jojo videos, right? That's and then okay
[21734.75s -> 21737.47s]  Yeah, that's it's a lot. Well, maybe I think there's actually 15
[21738.48s -> 21740.38s]  but
[21740.38s -> 21742.38s]  There were people spent a lot of time on them
[21742.86s -> 21746.94s]  And I didn't want to have it because at that point it's okay this all these submissions
[21747.66s -> 21752.54s]  Well, i've got to get rid of all these and uh, only one of these videos can make it in you know
[21752.54s -> 21754.54s]  What I mean at that point it becomes a contest
[21754.86s -> 21758.06s]  rather than just like a night of just putting up as much as we possibly can
[21758.94s -> 21760.06s]  which is
[21760.06s -> 21761.58s]  That was the purpose of
[21761.58s -> 21763.58s]  The this last sunday, you know
[21765.63s -> 21770.19s]  I didn't want to really exclude very many submissions. It was hard to exclude a bunch of them
[21770.19s -> 21773.47s]  But some of them really couldn't be used for various reasons
[21774.19s -> 21786.88s]  But it was more of a community night than like a video contest
[21787.60s -> 21790.88s]  There is plenty of potential to do a video contest
[21791.68s -> 21805.81s]  We'll see but I had a lot of fun
[21806.29s -> 21808.29s]  And I said this on the stream before
[21808.94s -> 21810.94s]  At the end and at the beginning and midway through
[21811.87s -> 21815.71s]  I was absolutely blown away by how just how fucking creative
[21817.50s -> 21819.50s]  So many of you guys are so
[21820.90s -> 21828.27s]  I loved every second of it. Thank you asha for the five dollars asha 108
[21828.27s -> 21836.82s]  You're still the number one pub g streamer on ipad and I will keep my number one chicken dinner slot
[21837.46s -> 21842.62s]  As the number one mobile ipad pub g streamer
[21844.78s -> 21847.74s]  Thank you though for the five dollars. Thank you. Errol is for the one dollar germa earth. Thank you
[21848.38s -> 21851.92s]  Honey chain. Thanks for the one dollar. Thank you all the great videos and streams over the years
[21854.10s -> 21856.10s]  Thank you for watching the videos in the streams
[21856.66s -> 21859.54s]  Honey chain, thank you
[21859.54s -> 21865.14s]  And then finally dubsky dude for one dollar when you were in that pit with the boulder and those random animals spawned
[21865.70s -> 21870.42s]  That was very eerily similar to your old space master video. It kind of freaked me out
[21871.06s -> 21875.64s]  All you new people need to look that video up you can find it on an ancient website called youtube.com
[21881.10s -> 21888.43s]  Animals I just remember the bird flying upside down and around the circle
[21889.07s -> 21891.07s]  It was like a parakeet or something
[21895.23s -> 21897.23s]  and then the
[21900.54s -> 21904.96s]  What a weird fucking game
[21905.52s -> 21907.60s]  Uh, that is it for the bits
[21907.60s -> 21915.22s]  Let's show the sub credits while we make our way out of here. Let's put them up on the screen. What do you say?
[21918.43s -> 21922.85s]  Here they come. I got a feeling there's gonna be a lot of these
[21923.49s -> 21925.73s]  Considering the amount of gifted subs that were tonight
[21927.09s -> 21930.85s]  Oh, yeah
[21930.85s -> 21932.37s]  Holy shit
[21932.37s -> 21939.52s]  That's going fast
[21939.52s -> 21941.76s]  That type of video is why you started watching in the first place
[21944.90s -> 21946.90s]  Yeah, I mean I I always tried
[21947.28s -> 21949.28s]  I don't know. I get bored really easily guys
[21949.76s -> 21952.27s]  I know that
[21952.27s -> 21956.43s]  Uh a lot of people ask. Well, what's your process when you go to make a video or a stream?
[21957.31s -> 21959.71s]  It's pretty it's very easy. I I get very bored
[21960.82s -> 21967.46s]  And I like to try to do new things every time or play something different or try a different video or try a different idea
[21967.86s -> 21970.90s]  Because if I do the same thing for too long, I it'll bore me. I just get bored
[21981.65s -> 21983.65s]  Ever put something that you know is fun
[21984.21s -> 21986.19s]  off
[21986.19s -> 21988.24s]  um
[21988.24s -> 21990.24s]  You mean like I was having a good time and then
[21991.31s -> 21993.31s]  I know I was having fun, but I turned it off
[21995.74s -> 21997.74s]  I don't think so. Maybe um
[22000.06s -> 22001.74s]  Like red dead two
[22001.74s -> 22002.62s]  No
[22002.62s -> 22015.68s]  What the hell does this explain this image?
[22015.92s -> 22018.99s]  It's four feet tall
[22018.99s -> 22020.99s]  44 54 inches
[22022.69s -> 22025.81s]  What are you what are you talking about? You don't know how tall the ceilings in my room are
[22031.46s -> 22033.46s]  You don't know how tall my ceilings are
[22033.86s -> 22037.89s]  I'm not 54 inches tall
[22038.37s -> 22040.80s]  I'm like 68 or something
[22043.79s -> 22049.92s]  Don't make me get a stick and stand next to it. Hold on a second here
[22056.11s -> 22060.75s]  I i'm like 65. Oh, no, no, no 68 or 69 inches tall
[22064.59s -> 22066.59s]  Yeah, i'm 69 inches tall
[22066.67s -> 22077.15s]  Look at look at all these subs
[22077.31s -> 22078.94s]  That's so many
[22078.94s -> 22080.94s]  That's so many in one day
[22086.43s -> 22088.43s]  That's the that's the funny number
[22089.30s -> 22092.42s]  That's fine
[22092.42s -> 22094.66s]  Just because it's the funny number doesn't mean it's the real one
[22095.22s -> 22102.80s]  Four and a half feet tall
[22102.80s -> 22104.96s]  You know, i'm gonna let you guys have this one. Okay?

[22114.78s -> 22116.78s]  Oh bob bob champ we could have it
[22120.24s -> 22126.83s]  Don't let them have it. All right guys, i'll see you tomorrow for the game awards
[22127.39s -> 22134.24s]  It should be fun
[22134.24s -> 22135.68s]  Right at the very end
[22135.68s -> 22137.68s]  We had garfield the monday killer with the dollar
[22138.32s -> 22140.88s]  Garfield coming into the last second with one question
[22141.86s -> 22146.74s]  Uh, do you think the green screen streams and movie night streams would be a good thing to do as a yearly basis?
[22147.22s -> 22152.42s]  It felt appropriate to use the green screen stream and movie night to sandwich the rumble because all three streams seemed like a trinity of the
[22152.42s -> 22153.86s]  best of all
[22153.86s -> 22157.38s]  That i've ever offered
[22158.91s -> 22160.91s]  I told I talked about this once
[22161.63s -> 22165.47s]  Maybe a little bit more but I I want every since moving to las vegas
[22166.35s -> 22168.53s]  The whole point of coming out here
[22168.85s -> 22171.57s]  Was to try to dial it up to try to do more
[22172.80s -> 22173.60s]  to
[22173.60s -> 22175.60s]  every 30 to 45 days
[22176.00s -> 22178.00s]  Have something else going on
[22178.58s -> 22181.22s]  That was one of the number one reasons for being here
[22181.94s -> 22185.36s]  You know what I mean?
[22185.36s -> 22190.40s]  So a green screen it doesn't need to be a green screen. There's I have plans to do all kinds of shit
[22193.02s -> 22197.10s]  And the next thing that I plan on doing is probably going to be on christmas eve
[22197.74s -> 22200.06s]  That's a plan. I have a plan to do something on christmas eve
[22204.16s -> 22208.80s]  So they if you have been enjoying the last couple of weeks of the green screen stuff and then
[22209.76s -> 22210.64s]  um
[22210.64s -> 22215.28s]  The germa wrestling i'm trying to try i'm i'm going to dial it up to like 11, man
[22221.20s -> 22230.70s]  I start expecting that once a month 11 out of two
[22231.58s -> 22233.58s]  Oh, yeah, here it comes
[22233.58s -> 22236.13s]  Turn it up
[22236.13s -> 22237.78s]  one
[22237.78s -> 22239.14s]  one
[22239.14s -> 22243.70s]  Ah, let's just stay at one one. Let's stay at one. So pretty much i'm dialing it up to a one
[22244.34s -> 22251.71s]  At a 10
[22251.71s -> 22253.71s]  But that's my time
