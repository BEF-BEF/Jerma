[0.31s -> 19.07s]  You can't change anything, dude. Hey! Don't you stab me. Did you just kill that guy and I killed you at the same time?
[19.07s -> 22.43s]  Yeah, I had to make sure that all- Alright, boo, what are you doing?
[22.43s -> 29.23s]  I'm being stealthy. There's a cop there. Oh god. Oh boy.
[29.23s -> 36.18s]  Alright, get all these people out of their cars. We're gonna make a barricade.
[36.18s -> 42.06s]  Hold on, am I wedged in between these two things?
[42.06s -> 47.06s]  Okay, never mind, get out of the car and go get another one.
[47.06s -> 51.06s]  So, hold on, is there already a police barricade right here?
[51.06s -> 53.36s]  Hold on, what are you-
[53.36s -> 57.05s]  I'm having a hard time figuring out how this works.
[57.05s -> 61.05s]  Alright, get out of the car, get out of your cars. We're gonna get behind- Oh my god.
[61.05s -> 64.05s]  Get behind- Everyone get behind the cars.
[64.05s -> 66.05s]  We don't have guns, we have pistols.
[66.05s -> 68.05s]  Attack. I have a saw knife.
[68.05s -> 70.05s]  I just got the saw knife.
[70.05s -> 75.05s]  Make a barricade with the cars so the police can't get to us. So, light them up.
[75.05s -> 77.05s]  Light them up like dominoes.
[77.05s -> 80.05s]  Okay. See where I am, see on the mini ramp where I am.
[80.05s -> 82.05s]  I have car. Who's this dead guy?
[82.05s -> 86.05s]  I just shot that guy in his face, he was being annoying.
[86.05s -> 90.05s]  Alright, well get out of the way, I'm gonna- You didn't shoot this person.
[90.05s -> 94.05s]  Dude. Hey!
[94.05s -> 98.22s]  Alright, so line them up like an army of cars. There we go.
[98.22s -> 100.22s]  Yeah, alright, we're good, good.
[100.22s -> 103.22s]  And instant three stars for shooting a cop in the head.
[103.22s -> 105.22s]  She was head punching.
[105.22s -> 109.22s]  Alright, we just need- Once we get in the middle here, we can really start to-
[109.22s -> 111.22s]  This is where it gets crazy.
[111.22s -> 115.22s]  Oh my god, I just found a fucking striker shotgun. Not even kidding.
[115.22s -> 117.46s]  Let's keep it, because we're gonna need it.
[117.46s -> 119.77s]  Alright. It's like a- Oh my god.
[119.77s -> 121.77s]  Ow.
[121.77s -> 125.77s]  Alright, alright, everyone get in between. Get in between, so we don't get in trouble here.
[125.77s -> 127.77s]  What kind of parking was that?
[127.77s -> 130.77s]  Oh hey, by the way, how do you get next to the car?
[130.77s -> 132.77s]  Hey, what are you doing? I'm trying to use that.
[132.77s -> 134.01s]  Q, Q, Q, Q.
[134.01s -> 136.01s]  I'm trying to use that, you idiot!
[136.01s -> 138.31s]  Oh my god, there's so many enemies.
[138.31s -> 139.31s]  Alright, let's do it.
[139.31s -> 141.31s]  Oh my gosh.
[141.31s -> 143.31s]  I got shot in the grenade.
[143.31s -> 145.31s]  What? How did I die?
[145.31s -> 149.58s]  Wait, the bullets went through the car?
[149.58s -> 152.58s]  Look at all these freaking cops.
[152.58s -> 156.42s]  Oh, no, it's this guy with the shotgun.
[156.42s -> 158.42s]  The guy with the shotgun.
[158.42s -> 162.42s]  That asshole with the shotgun is dead.
[162.42s -> 164.42s]  There's like five cops right here.
[164.42s -> 170.68s]  Are you serious?
[170.68s -> 174.01s]  They're killing me so quickly.
[174.01s -> 177.01s]  No, we gotta get like in an alleyway.
[177.01s -> 178.01s]  Can you auto-aim?
[178.01s -> 179.01s]  I'm like kicking their ass.
[179.01s -> 181.01s]  Can you auto-aim? How do you get behind cover?
[181.01s -> 182.01s]  Pro-sniper.
[182.01s -> 184.01s]  Hey, baby.
[184.01s -> 187.01s]  You looking to go for a ride, sweetheart?
[187.01s -> 188.01s]  Dude, don't shoot the...
[188.01s -> 191.01s]  Oh my god.
[191.01s -> 195.01s]  Look at this mess of cops.
[195.01s -> 197.01s]  Get in. Get in the car.
[197.01s -> 202.19s]  Get in. Calm down.
[202.19s -> 203.19s]  Oh, this guy is not happy.
[203.19s -> 206.19s]  Look at that mess. Oh my god.
[206.19s -> 208.43s]  Oh, the music. Oh my god.
[208.43s -> 209.43s]  Hey, thanks for blowing out the tires.
[209.43s -> 211.43s]  That like really helped.
[211.43s -> 213.43s]  That really helped our escape.
[213.43s -> 215.43s]  Alright, boo, get in.
[215.43s -> 216.43s]  You want me to get...
[216.43s -> 217.43s]  It's two-seater.
[217.43s -> 218.43s]  Oh, is it?
[218.43s -> 220.43s]  No, you get in the back.
[220.43s -> 221.43s]  How do I turn the radio off?
[221.43s -> 222.43s]  There's no off.
[222.43s -> 223.43s]  Alright, let's go.
[223.43s -> 227.43s]  Oh, so we're gonna do drive-bys in this piece of shit.
[227.43s -> 231.43s]  Oh, by the way, you can thank MLC Stealth for shooting out the tires for fun.
[231.43s -> 233.43s]  I can't even drive this damn car.
[233.43s -> 236.43s]  Hey guys, I have like a story to tell you.
[236.43s -> 238.43s]  You ever hear the one about the guy that...
[238.43s -> 243.67s]  Oh my god.
[243.67s -> 245.67s]  I jumped out too.
[245.67s -> 248.67s]  Yeah, thanks. Ditch that stupid cop.
[248.67s -> 254.42s]  That's like playing Battlefield where they just ditch a helicopter mid-air.
[254.42s -> 256.42s]  We can get six to...
[256.42s -> 258.42s]  Stealth, did you shoot the damn tire out?
[258.42s -> 259.42s]  Yeah.
[259.42s -> 261.42s]  You son of a...
[261.42s -> 264.42s]  I did that the second you were about to get in that car.
[264.42s -> 265.42s]  Oh my god.
[265.42s -> 268.42s]  What is with you? Don't shoot the tires. We need them.
[268.42s -> 270.42s]  I thought I shot both of them. Only that one.
[270.42s -> 271.42s]  Alright, new plan.
[271.42s -> 273.42s]  Can I shoot the tire from right here?
[273.42s -> 274.42s]  I don't know.
[274.42s -> 276.42s]  Oh, that poor guy.
[276.42s -> 278.42s]  Oh, grandma cleaners.
[278.42s -> 281.42s]  Alright, well Stealth, you brought this on yourself.
[281.42s -> 283.60s]  Oh no.
[283.60s -> 286.10s]  Oh, I landed in the water.
[286.10s -> 288.10s]  It didn't even work.
[288.10s -> 291.10s]  My guy jumped out the car and landed over the fence.
[291.10s -> 294.10s]  Why did that not even work? That was stupid.
[294.10s -> 296.10s]  Oh jeez.
[296.10s -> 299.10s]  Alright, that's your punishment for shooting the tires out.
[299.10s -> 301.10s]  That is shotgun.
[301.10s -> 303.10s]  Alright, what have we learned today?
[303.10s -> 309.10s]  We've learned that it's impossible to get six stars when you play with MLZ stealth.
[309.10s -> 311.10s]  Oh fuck, here comes...
[311.10s -> 314.10s]  The coppers are coming again, I'm sniping them.
[314.10s -> 316.10s]  Oh, you're back there, alright.
[316.10s -> 318.10s]  Alright, good, this is actually a great spot.
[318.10s -> 319.10s]  This is a great spot.
[319.10s -> 323.96s]  This is a fantastic spot.
[323.96s -> 326.52s]  This thing's automatic, my god.
[326.52s -> 327.52s]  I hear a helicopter.
[327.52s -> 329.52s]  Yeah, that thing shoots really fast.
[329.52s -> 331.89s]  Oh, there's a lot of them.
[331.89s -> 333.89s]  That's the SWAT team right there.
[333.89s -> 335.89s]  Wow, I'm not even near you guys.
[335.89s -> 336.89s]  I'm running.
[336.89s -> 337.89s]  This thing's gonna explode.
[337.89s -> 338.89s]  Run! Get off!
[338.89s -> 340.89s]  No, why am I jumping on top of the car?
[340.89s -> 342.89s]  No!
[342.89s -> 345.32s]  Make a run for it.
[345.32s -> 347.32s]  Oh, I just barely got away from that.
[347.32s -> 350.65s]  Holy crap.
[350.65s -> 352.65s]  I've had a grenade launcher.
[352.65s -> 354.65s]  There's gonna be plenty of guys for you to snipe here in a second.
[354.65s -> 356.65s]  Hey, can you see those choppers up there?
[356.65s -> 357.65s]  I can.
[357.65s -> 359.65s]  Okay, just wait for me to...
[359.65s -> 362.78s]  Oh, I just got sniped.
[362.78s -> 365.78s]  Oh wait, let me get in that SWAT car too.
[365.78s -> 366.78s]  Oh wait, that's you.
[366.78s -> 367.78s]  Oh, wrong button.
[367.78s -> 370.78s]  Let's get in the SWAT car.
[370.78s -> 372.78s]  Yeah, as you climb in, you get body armor.
[372.78s -> 373.78s]  I got full body armor.
[373.78s -> 374.78s]  I can protect you guys.
[374.78s -> 376.78s]  I can't, there's choppers around me.
[376.78s -> 378.78s]  I have to shoot them.
[378.78s -> 380.78s]  This guy's like sandwiched.
[380.78s -> 381.78s]  This thing's gonna blow.
[381.78s -> 384.78s]  Hey, that thing right next to it's gonna blow.
[384.78s -> 386.78s]  That thing's gonna explode.
[386.78s -> 388.78s]  Run away!
[388.78s -> 391.02s]  Oh, it's intact.
[391.02s -> 393.02s]  It's intact.
[393.02s -> 395.02s]  Oh, my god.
[395.02s -> 398.61s]  There's so many people here.
[398.61s -> 400.61s]  Wanna see something cool?
[400.61s -> 401.61s]  Yeah, I do.
[401.61s -> 402.61s]  Okay.
[402.61s -> 403.61s]  Feast your eyes.
[403.61s -> 404.61s]  In three, two, one.
[404.61s -> 405.61s]  What did you just do?
[405.61s -> 407.61s]  Oh, my god!
[407.61s -> 409.61s]  You just blew them all up.
[409.61s -> 411.61s]  They're on the left.
[411.61s -> 414.61s]  Look at that guy flying.
[414.61s -> 418.61s]  Look at that guy flying.
[418.61s -> 419.61s]  Hold on, German, let me in.
[419.61s -> 420.61s]  Alright, get in.
[420.61s -> 422.61s]  I think you have to get in the back, Will.
[422.61s -> 424.61s]  Oh, is it still intact?
[424.61s -> 426.61s]  Yeah, this thing's ready to go, I think.
[426.61s -> 427.61s]  Can you get in?
[427.61s -> 429.61s]  Oh, yeah, hell yeah.
[429.61s -> 433.61s]  Now we are unstoppable, baby.
[433.61s -> 435.61s]  How are we gonna kill those melee godfors above us?
[435.61s -> 437.61s]  How do you switch weapons while on this thing?
[437.61s -> 439.78s]  I don't know.
[439.78s -> 440.78s]  I don't wanna press buttons.
[440.78s -> 444.34s]  You ram into them head on.
[444.34s -> 445.34s]  Oh, this guy.
[445.34s -> 447.34s]  Bad day for you, buddy.
[447.34s -> 449.34s]  Oh, that was epic.
[449.34s -> 451.78s]  Oh, you shoot out of the back?
[451.78s -> 454.78s]  Yeah, you cut right through, and I shot him up, and he kind of flipped the car.
[454.78s -> 456.78s]  Now he's on his back.
[456.78s -> 458.78s]  That's unfortunate.
[458.78s -> 460.78s]  Now, this thing is slow as shit.
[460.78s -> 464.91s]  I hope we see, like, I hope we railroad somebody straight ahead.
[464.91s -> 466.91s]  This would be so funny.
[466.91s -> 468.91s]  Oh, too bad we didn't get that guy.
[468.91s -> 470.60s]  Alright, so ready?
[470.60s -> 471.60s]  Here's what we're gonna do.
[471.60s -> 472.60s]  Break!
[472.60s -> 473.60s]  He's gonna ram right into the back of us.
[473.60s -> 475.60s]  Oh, god, he's gonna hit me.
[475.60s -> 480.76s]  Oh, come on, you can't take all of the tech.
[480.76s -> 483.19s]  Yeah, I can't shoot these guys.
[483.19s -> 485.19s]  I can only shoot if they're, like, right to my right.
[485.19s -> 487.56s]  I wish we had, like, an ice cream truck.
[487.56s -> 490.89s]  Yee!
[490.89s -> 493.13s]  Oh, my god.
[493.13s -> 497.75s]  Um, you have to really piss them off for six stars, don't you?
[497.75s -> 499.75s]  Uh, yeah, I know, really.
[499.75s -> 500.75s]  Oh, my god, we've been at five stars lately.
[500.75s -> 502.93s]  Do you have, like, grenades or any Molotovs or anything?
[502.93s -> 503.93s]  I don't know how to change guns.
[503.93s -> 504.93s]  I have, like, a grenade launcher.
[504.93s -> 506.68s]  Cute.
[506.68s -> 507.68s]  How do you change guns?
[507.68s -> 508.68s]  Oh, I have Molotovs.
[508.68s -> 509.68s]  What?
[509.68s -> 510.68s]  What just happened?
[510.68s -> 511.68s]  I got shot out.
[511.68s -> 512.68s]  You got shot out of the car?
[512.68s -> 513.86s]  Yeah, they shot me out.
[513.86s -> 514.86s]  Oh, no.
[514.86s -> 515.86s]  Oh, no.
[515.86s -> 517.86s]  I've lost my Molotovs.
[517.86s -> 519.86s]  Oh, I spawned next to you.
[519.86s -> 520.86s]  I left you for dead.
[520.86s -> 521.86s]  What?
[521.86s -> 522.86s]  You left you for dead.
[522.86s -> 523.86s]  That's what you did.
[523.86s -> 525.48s]  No, I didn't.
[525.48s -> 526.48s]  I got this cruiser now.
[526.48s -> 527.48s]  I'm in the cruiser.
[527.48s -> 530.77s]  Oh, no, I'm not.
[530.77s -> 531.77s]  I'm flipping over.
[531.77s -> 532.77s]  Oh.
[532.77s -> 533.77s]  All right, so we're good human beings.
[533.77s -> 534.77s]  What the hell is going on?
[534.77s -> 535.77s]  Why is this helicopter, like, disembodied?
[535.77s -> 536.77s]  Oh, my god.
[536.77s -> 537.77s]  Wow.
[537.77s -> 538.77s]  Oh, he can't get in there.
[538.77s -> 539.77s]  Oh, the pilot still is.
[539.77s -> 540.77s]  Can we get inside and do nothing with it?
[540.77s -> 541.77s]  Wait, the pilot's still in there?
[541.77s -> 542.77s]  Yeah.
[542.77s -> 543.77s]  Oh, the passenger.
[543.77s -> 544.77s]  Oh, come on.
[544.77s -> 545.77s]  Um, he's...
[545.77s -> 546.77s]  I don't think it's glitched out.
[546.77s -> 547.77s]  Hey, let me on.
[547.77s -> 548.77s]  Let me on.
[548.77s -> 551.29s]  Yes.
[551.29s -> 552.29s]  All right, let's go.
[553.29s -> 556.45s]  How do you do a wheeling?
[556.45s -> 558.65s]  Um, I don't know.
[558.65s -> 559.82s]  Just drive really fast into a car.
[559.82s -> 560.82s]  Oh, yeah.
[560.82s -> 561.82s]  Wow.
[561.82s -> 562.82s]  Everybody's working for the weekend.
[562.82s -> 563.82s]  Oh.
[563.82s -> 564.82s]  Oh.
[564.82s -> 568.05s]  Oh.
[568.05s -> 569.05s]  Oh.
[569.05s -> 570.05s]  Oh.
[570.05s -> 571.05s]  Oh.
[571.05s -> 572.05s]  Oh.
[572.05s -> 573.05s]  Oh.
[573.05s -> 574.99s]  Oh.
[574.99s -> 576.42s]  Oh.
[576.42s -> 577.42s]  Oh.
[577.42s -> 580.14s]  Oh.
[580.14s -> 581.14s]  Oh.
[581.14s -> 582.14s]  Oh.
[582.14s -> 583.14s]  Oh.
[583.14s -> 586.17s]  Oh.
[587.54s -> 598.70s]  Broke my back across like one of these telephone spots.
[598.70s -> 599.70s]  I didn't even get like hurt.
