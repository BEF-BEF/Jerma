[0.00s -> 4.16s]  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"]
[82.93s -> 84.93s]  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"]
[112.93s -> 114.93s]  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"]
[573.78s -> 575.78s]  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"]
[669.57s -> 671.57s]  No, I'm not sure. This one right here. How are you?
[671.57s -> 673.57s]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to TheGerber985
[673.57s -> 678.13s]  and partnership with Andy Mark Carnival.
[678.13s -> 680.13s]  Now, I know a lot of you are probably wondering
[680.13s -> 682.13s]  what's going on here.
[682.13s -> 684.13s]  I'll give you a brief description.
[684.13s -> 686.13s]  I'm so excited for this. I literally...
[686.13s -> 688.13s]  This has been a long time coming.
[688.13s -> 690.13s]  And I do have to just really
[690.13s -> 692.13s]  shout out a few people here.
[692.13s -> 694.13s]  You're going to have a lot of fun.
[694.13s -> 696.13s]  First of all, I want to thank Andy Mark
[696.13s -> 698.13s]  for their contracting of the robots.
[698.13s -> 700.13s]  They did an insane job.
[700.13s -> 702.13s]  You have no idea
[702.13s -> 704.13s]  what you're talking about.
[704.13s -> 706.13s]  Listen to me. You have no idea.
[706.13s -> 708.13s]  We're going to go to this camera too because
[708.13s -> 710.13s]  I can't see chat. That's my problem.
[710.13s -> 712.88s]  We're going to this one.
[712.88s -> 719.28s]  I have power. I have real power.
[719.28s -> 721.46s]  Now I can see chat.
[721.46s -> 723.46s]  Yeah, that's my fault. I'm an idiot.
[723.46s -> 725.46s]  I want to thank Andy Mark
[725.46s -> 727.46s]  especially. You don't see them
[727.46s -> 729.46s]  but they're back here.
[729.46s -> 731.46s]  And they did a hell of a job making these robots.
[731.46s -> 733.46s]  But what are you talking about?
[733.46s -> 735.46s]  We're going to be playing games on this stream.
[735.46s -> 737.46s]  This is a carnival. So what do you do
[737.46s -> 739.46s]  at a carnival? You play games. And there is not
[739.46s -> 741.46s]  one game.
[741.46s -> 743.46s]  There are not two games.
[743.46s -> 745.95s]  There are not three games on
[745.95s -> 747.95s]  this stream. Not four, not five, not six!
[747.95s -> 751.54s]  Hopefully this doesn't
[751.54s -> 753.54s]  blow away. I really hope it doesn't.
[753.54s -> 755.54s]  Because we've got strong winds in the forecast.
[755.54s -> 757.54s]  That thing goes...
[757.54s -> 759.54s]  Fuck it.
[759.54s -> 761.54s]  You know, whatever.
[761.54s -> 763.54s]  There are seven
[763.54s -> 765.54s]  seven games that are going to be
[765.54s -> 767.97s]  played. That's right.
[767.97s -> 769.97s]  And they range from all kinds of different things.
[769.97s -> 771.97s]  These games are going to be
[771.97s -> 773.97s]  played by you.
[773.97s -> 775.97s]  Not me. They're going to be played by you.
[775.97s -> 777.97s]  By you. Yeah, so I'm seeing
[777.97s -> 779.97s]  some Jerva Venuses over here.
[779.97s -> 782.64s]  What are you saying?
[782.64s -> 784.64s]  Seven hundred thousand... No, no, no.
[784.64s -> 787.14s]  I know. I know. Listen.
[787.14s -> 789.14s]  I know I look like a group of soccer
[789.14s -> 791.14s]  coaches banged a bunch of
[791.14s -> 793.14s]  red lobster employees. But that's beyond
[793.14s -> 795.50s]  the point, okay?
[795.50s -> 797.50s]  We are going to move to different games today.
[797.50s -> 799.50s]  And some other
[799.50s -> 801.50s]  special surprises as well.
[801.50s -> 803.50s]  So stay tuned. I hope you enjoy this.
[803.50s -> 805.50s]  A lot of time went into this.
[805.50s -> 807.50s]  So, I mean,
[807.50s -> 809.50s]  if we can really decide
[809.50s -> 811.50s]  when we're going to move to the first
[811.50s -> 813.50s]  game. I have the power here. Remember, this is my
[813.50s -> 815.50s]  controller. I press this three or four times.
[815.50s -> 817.50s]  And we move to the next game.
[817.50s -> 819.94s]  So, I am just going
[819.94s -> 823.39s]  to be going like this. Somebody gift that.
[823.39s -> 825.57s]  Put it on the fucking
[825.57s -> 830.43s]  Reddit. What are you saying?
[830.43s -> 834.40s]  No stop. No stop.
[834.40s -> 836.40s]  What do you mean stop? Why am I stopping? Get it
[836.40s -> 838.90s]  quick. He's a Redditor.
[838.90s -> 842.35s]  So I use Reddit.
[842.35s -> 844.35s]  I've been on Reddit like twice.
[844.35s -> 847.74s]  Is it a problem?
[847.74s -> 849.74s]  There's a bug on the camera?
[849.74s -> 853.84s]  Which one?
[853.84s -> 855.84s]  Which one
[855.84s -> 857.84s]  on the camera has the bug on it?
[857.84s -> 864.29s]  Top right. I don't know which one
[864.29s -> 866.29s]  is my right. This up here?
[866.29s -> 869.04s]  No, that's a German 985 logo.
[869.04s -> 871.04s]  To make sure that you know where this
[871.04s -> 874.69s]  fucking came from. All right.
[874.69s -> 876.69s]  So first up,
[876.69s -> 879.76s]  you're going to have a series of controls
[879.76s -> 881.76s]  on your screen.
[881.76s -> 883.76s]  Series of controls. They're going to be
[883.76s -> 885.76s]  W, A, S, D.
[885.76s -> 887.76s]  Up, down, left, right.
[887.76s -> 889.76s]  Power. Decrease power. Increase power.
[889.76s -> 891.76s]  You're going to see them on the screen.
[891.76s -> 893.76s]  The first game that we're going to do
[893.76s -> 896.69s]  is ring toss.
[896.69s -> 899.57s]  That's right. I'll demonstrate
[899.57s -> 901.57s]  before we go. You know, I'm going to demonstrate
[901.57s -> 903.74s]  the ring toss for you. Ring toss
[903.74s -> 905.74s]  is the first one. And we got
[905.74s -> 907.74s]  ring toss. We got a pitching
[907.74s -> 909.74s]  machine that we've got.
[909.74s -> 911.74s]  You guys have no idea. This is like
[911.74s -> 913.74s]  literally, I...
[913.74s -> 915.74s]  Can you hear the wind?
[915.74s -> 918.29s]  This is going to be crazy.
[918.29s -> 922.06s]  So, are
[922.06s -> 924.06s]  we ready for the first game?
[924.06s -> 926.75s]  We're ready for the first game.
[926.75s -> 928.75s]  You know, I'm getting worried about having a secret service.
[928.75s -> 930.93s]  Do you see this? You didn't think I was going to have a fucking
[930.93s -> 932.93s]  secret service thing in my ear. I do.
[932.93s -> 934.93s]  First game. Let's go. Ring toss.
[934.93s -> 952.02s]  Cue it up. Hey.
[952.02s -> 954.02s]  How are ya?
[954.02s -> 956.58s]  You see on the screen right now, you have a series of
[956.58s -> 958.58s]  commands and graphics.
[958.58s -> 960.58s]  And those commands are going to directly
[960.58s -> 962.58s]  connotate to the movements
[962.58s -> 964.58s]  of the robot that you will see on the screen here
[964.58s -> 966.58s]  very shortly. Right now.
[966.58s -> 968.82s]  I will prove that
[968.82s -> 970.82s]  this game is winnable, by the way.
[970.82s -> 972.82s]  If I can get a ring over here.
[972.82s -> 976.90s]  As we see.
[976.90s -> 978.90s]  Exhibit A.
[978.90s -> 983.81s]  I heard a balloon pop.
[983.81s -> 986.11s]  Get down. Get out of here.
[986.11s -> 993.79s]  I'm the Carney. I gotta prove
[993.79s -> 1000.13s]  you can do it first. Give me another couple.
[1000.13s -> 1007.81s]  Okay.
[1007.81s -> 1015.23s]  Three more tries and I'll get it. Fuck.
[1015.23s -> 1017.98s]  I practiced this for like an hour.
[1017.98s -> 1024.32s]  Yes!
[1024.32s -> 1026.32s]  So it's possible. You see, I gotta prove it's possible
[1026.32s -> 1028.32s]  first. As you see
[1028.32s -> 1030.62s]  here, this is the first
[1030.62s -> 1032.62s]  of the three
[1032.62s -> 1034.62s]  Andy Mark created
[1034.62s -> 1036.62s]  robots.
[1036.62s -> 1038.62s]  Get a shot of this robot, please.
[1038.62s -> 1040.62s]  I want to get this thing in the camera.
[1040.62s -> 1042.62s]  Look at this thing. It's absolutely stunning.
[1042.62s -> 1045.31s]  This is a launcher.
[1045.31s -> 1047.74s]  You have to go
[1047.74s -> 1049.74s]  where you want it to go to launch.
[1049.74s -> 1051.74s]  By the way, very important.
[1051.74s -> 1054.30s]  This thing is going to have a timer on the screen.
[1054.30s -> 1056.54s]  There's a rumor
[1056.54s -> 1058.54s]  here. I don't know if you heard that.
[1058.54s -> 1060.54s]  There's a rumor here.
[1060.54s -> 1062.54s]  They fucking follow me everywhere.
[1062.54s -> 1064.54s]  They literally flew across the country.
[1064.54s -> 1066.54s]  I can hear that.
[1066.54s -> 1068.54s]  Literally.
[1068.54s -> 1070.54s]  That's unfucking believable.
[1070.54s -> 1072.54s]  There's going to be a series of commands on the screen.
[1072.54s -> 1074.54s]  They're right there.
[1074.54s -> 1076.54s]  You have to control this.
[1076.54s -> 1078.54s]  It will only accept inputs
[1078.54s -> 1080.54s]  when there's the green light on the bottom of the screen.
[1080.54s -> 1082.54s]  When the timer reaches zero, it
[1082.54s -> 1084.54s]  fires.
[1084.54s -> 1086.54s]  Make sure you get it in the right spot.
[1086.54s -> 1088.54s]  I'm seeing people spam it already.
[1088.54s -> 1090.54s]  That's not how it works. You have to wait.
[1090.54s -> 1092.54s]  Wait until it's ready.
[1092.54s -> 1094.72s]  Green light means go.
[1094.72s -> 1098.69s]  Can we get a demonstration of what it looks like?
[1098.69s -> 1100.69s]  Interesting stuff. Let's see what it looks like.
[1100.69s -> 1107.58s]  Oh!
[1107.58s -> 1109.58s]  I was a little overshot, but you get the idea.
[1109.58s -> 1113.55s]  I thought I could do it without looking.
[1113.55s -> 1116.82s]  So,
[1116.82s -> 1118.82s]  when the command is green,
[1118.82s -> 1121.38s]  please control the robot
[1121.38s -> 1124.64s]  if you will.
[1124.64s -> 1126.64s]  Let's see if we can get it loaded for you.
[1126.64s -> 1128.64s]  I actually have to make sure I collect these.
[1128.64s -> 1130.64s]  I have to make sure I collect them because
[1130.64s -> 1133.14s]  they're going to be gone.
[1133.14s -> 1135.14s]  When the timer is on the screen and you see the green light,
[1135.14s -> 1141.22s]  that means you can control it.
[1141.22s -> 1150.75s]  I see green light go!
[1150.75s -> 1152.75s]  It's actually working!
[1152.75s -> 1154.93s]  It works!
[1154.93s -> 1156.93s]  It's phenomenal!
[1156.93s -> 1158.93s]  When that timer reaches zero,
[1158.93s -> 1172.16s]  it's going to fire that ring.
[1172.16s -> 1174.16s]  Don't shoot at the guy.
[1174.16s -> 1176.16s]  I just want to make that really clear.
[1176.16s -> 1178.16s]  Don't shoot at the guy. You've got to get three of these.
[1178.16s -> 1180.53s]  We're not going to move on until you get all three.
[1180.53s -> 1182.53s]  Shoot at the streamer.
[1182.53s -> 1184.53s]  Shoot at the streamer. You've got to get three.
[1184.53s -> 1187.66s]  I've got a drink around here somewhere.
[1187.66s -> 1192.59s]  I don't know what the hell it is.
[1192.59s -> 1197.14s]  Zero? Nice try.
[1197.14s -> 1199.50s]  Disabled commands, by the way.
[1199.50s -> 1201.50s]  Do not write commands when it's at red.
[1201.50s -> 1203.50s]  Because when it's at red,
[1203.50s -> 1205.50s]  your commands are not going to be taken
[1205.50s -> 1207.50s]  because we're doing it on a timer.
[1207.50s -> 1209.50s]  That's wonderful.
[1209.50s -> 1211.50s]  Nice to see you. Aiming directly at my face.
[1211.50s -> 1214.70s]  You have to win the game!
[1214.70s -> 1217.26s]  You have to play the game.
[1217.26s -> 1225.90s]  When it's green, that's when you do it!
[1225.90s -> 1227.90s]  Win the game! Forget about shooting it at me.
[1227.90s -> 1235.12s]  What have we got?
[1235.12s -> 1237.12s]  You think that's a good spot?
[1237.12s -> 1239.49s]  You think that's a good place for it?
[1239.49s -> 1241.49s]  It might be a little too high, I think.
[1241.49s -> 1243.49s]  Alright, that was close.
[1243.49s -> 1245.49s]  That was close.
[1245.49s -> 1249.33s]  It was a little too far this way.
[1249.33s -> 1251.33s]  But you get the idea.
[1251.33s -> 1253.33s]  This is a warm-up, guys.
[1253.33s -> 1255.33s]  You are getting warmed up
[1255.33s -> 1257.33s]  for the inevitable, incredibly complicated
[1257.33s -> 1259.33s]  events that are going to take place here soon.
[1259.33s -> 1261.50s]  Seeing some pog jams, that's good.
[1261.50s -> 1264.77s]  What have we got? Timer on the screen.
[1264.77s -> 1266.77s]  Let's see it. Chat commands have been accepted.
[1266.77s -> 1270.61s]  Anybody going for the back row?
[1270.61s -> 1276.18s]  No, they're going this way.
[1276.18s -> 1281.04s]  Where are you going?
[1281.04s -> 1284.80s]  You're going right in the middle?
[1284.80s -> 1288.13s]  This is insane to see this,
[1288.13s -> 1290.13s]  by the way, live happening.
[1290.13s -> 1294.48s]  The wind is picking up.
[1294.48s -> 1296.48s]  You guys might get lucky from the wind.
[1296.48s -> 1300.45s]  Oh, shit. Strong winds.
[1300.45s -> 1303.71s]  It's going to knock all the bottles over.
[1303.71s -> 1307.87s]  Oh!
[1307.87s -> 1309.87s]  No, that's not a point. Not a point.
[1309.87s -> 1312.37s]  You're in the middle. Sorry.
[1312.37s -> 1314.37s]  I should probably show you the prize that you're playing for,
[1314.37s -> 1316.54s]  but that'll be a surprise, too.
[1316.54s -> 1323.26s]  That was actually pretty close.
[1323.26s -> 1325.26s]  That was as close as you're probably going to come.
[1325.26s -> 1327.26s]  This is hard. It's not easy.
[1327.26s -> 1332.90s]  Look at that. You can see your movements on screen.
[1332.90s -> 1335.52s]  Remember, there's power as well.
[1335.52s -> 1337.52s]  You're not just controlling left and right.
[1337.52s -> 1339.52s]  You're talking about power level.
[1339.52s -> 1342.58s]  Control your power.
[1342.58s -> 1344.58s]  You've seen Dragon Ball Z.
[1344.58s -> 1346.58s]  I haven't. I mean, I'm never going to watch it,
[1346.58s -> 1348.58s]  but you've seen it. At least a hundred of you.
[1348.58s -> 1350.58s]  Maybe. Possibly.
[1350.58s -> 1353.46s]  I've got to get you a better view.
[1353.46s -> 1359.86s]  That looks good.
[1359.86s -> 1368.80s]  Nope. That one wasn't even close.
[1368.80s -> 1370.80s]  That was not even close.
[1374.19s -> 1377.25s]  That's so funny.
[1377.25s -> 1379.25s]  So how many did we get? One, two, three, four, five, six.
[1379.25s -> 1381.25s]  Oh, like six.
[1381.25s -> 1383.25s]  A hundred? Were there a hundred bottles?
[1383.25s -> 1386.00s]  I think there's a hundred bottles
[1386.00s -> 1388.62s]  for you to choose from.
[1388.62s -> 1390.62s]  I'm going to give you a tactic here as the person
[1390.62s -> 1392.62s]  that's the carny here.
[1392.62s -> 1394.62s]  I'm going to go right in the middle because
[1394.62s -> 1396.62s]  then it can bounce around.
[1396.62s -> 1398.62s]  You've got to do these tactics. Get the fuck out of here.
[1398.62s -> 1400.62s]  What a wasted throw.
[1400.62s -> 1403.31s]  Thank you for listening.
[1403.31s -> 1406.00s]  Are you going to listen? I don't think you are.
[1406.00s -> 1408.62s]  Are you not going to listen to me?
[1408.62s -> 1410.62s]  You're just going to fire it at my face.
[1410.62s -> 1413.18s]  You're going to just aim it this way? Good. Let's go.
[1413.18s -> 1415.18s]  Let's go. Yeah.
[1415.18s -> 1419.26s]  Delete it. Delete it.
[1419.26s -> 1421.26s]  I just did it with my mind.
[1421.26s -> 1423.26s]  I looked at it and just snapped it out of existence.
[1423.26s -> 1425.70s]  Just like Big Bird.
[1425.70s -> 1427.70s]  I got a purple guy.
[1427.70s -> 1429.70s]  Have you never seen Infinity War, by the way?
[1429.70s -> 1431.70s]  It's a great movie.
[1431.70s -> 1433.70s]  I would recommend it.
[1433.70s -> 1435.70s]  I just out of nowhere just wanted to say
[1435.70s -> 1437.70s]  that that's a good movie. You should watch it
[1437.70s -> 1439.70s]  if you have a chance. No spoilers or anything.
[1439.70s -> 1441.70s]  I don't have a spoiler here. It's just a good movie.
[1441.70s -> 1445.73s]  Remember, it's when it's at
[1445.73s -> 1447.73s]  zero is when it fires.
[1447.73s -> 1449.73s]  You guys are never going to win this game.
[1449.73s -> 1451.73s]  I'm starting to come to the realization that it's just not going to happen.
[1451.73s -> 1454.80s]  It's just not going to happen.
[1454.80s -> 1456.80s]  It's unwinnable. Snap that one
[1456.80s -> 1461.15s]  out of existence, too.
[1461.15s -> 1464.86s]  Like Elmo.
[1464.86s -> 1470.56s]  No, no. We got it. We got it. We got it.
[1470.56s -> 1473.63s]  You didn't give enough power.
[1473.63s -> 1475.63s]  You didn't give enough power
[1475.63s -> 1477.63s]  on that one. That was like zero.
[1477.63s -> 1479.63s]  You have to put more
[1479.63s -> 1481.63s]  power. You have to put more
[1481.63s -> 1483.94s]  power. It's got to be at least
[1483.94s -> 1485.94s]  like, come on.
[1485.94s -> 1487.94s]  You're raising the hammer.
[1487.94s -> 1489.94s]  It's a hammer. So you
[1489.94s -> 1491.94s]  raise it high enough to launch
[1491.94s -> 1493.94s]  the ring over here.
[1493.94s -> 1496.11s]  It's simple instructions.
[1496.11s -> 1498.42s]  It's very easy. You saw me
[1498.42s -> 1500.42s]  do it. I'm surprised that you
[1500.42s -> 1502.42s]  can't. And now you're going all the way down.
[1502.42s -> 1506.88s]  Now you're going all
[1506.88s -> 1510.02s]  the way down. You guys
[1510.02s -> 1512.02s]  are breaking this thing. You guys are going too far down.
[1512.02s -> 1514.02s]  Pull it up a little bit.
[1514.02s -> 1516.02s]  Up higher. That's not going to do
[1516.02s -> 1518.02s]  anything. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher.
[1518.02s -> 1520.02s]  I'm just trying to help you here.
[1520.02s -> 1522.32s]  Because you've got to pull it up
[1522.32s -> 1524.32s]  a little bit like 10, 20 percent higher.
[1524.32s -> 1526.32s]  Because seriously, let me show you.
[1526.32s -> 1528.32s]  I'll give you a quick little look.
[1528.32s -> 1530.56s]  That's just not going to happen.
[1530.56s -> 1539.63s]  Shit.
[1539.63s -> 1541.63s]  I think the wind like shot that one.
[1541.63s -> 1543.87s]  The wind just like shot it down.
[1547.78s -> 1549.78s]  I don't want these to fall.
[1549.78s -> 1553.62s]  We've got some extreme winds.
[1553.62s -> 1556.69s]  These fall.
[1556.69s -> 1558.69s]  This took like 67 minutes
[1558.69s -> 1560.69s]  to put all these in the right place.
[1560.69s -> 1563.76s]  You understand? If the wind
[1563.76s -> 1565.76s]  picks up high enough, these are going to fly.
[1565.76s -> 1567.76s]  And then we're going to have to move on
[1567.76s -> 1574.67s]  to the next game.
[1574.67s -> 1576.85s]  I'm scared. Let me show you how it works.
[1576.85s -> 1584.13s]  Damn it.
[1584.13s -> 1586.13s]  We're waiting for the wind to settle for a second here.
[1586.13s -> 1588.13s]  If you can believe it, let's go.
[1588.13s -> 1590.50s]  So,
[1590.50s -> 1593.94s]  let's do it. Pull it in.
[1593.94s -> 1601.87s]  I'm not very good at this.
[1601.87s -> 1603.87s]  So the wind is
[1603.87s -> 1605.87s]  kind of causing a few problems here.
[1605.87s -> 1607.87s]  That's what happens when you have
[1607.87s -> 1609.87s]  15
[1609.87s -> 1611.87s]  million people
[1611.87s -> 1613.87s]  all at the same time putting commands in
[1613.87s -> 1615.87s]  with torrential 60 mph winds.
[1615.87s -> 1617.87s]  As you can see,
[1617.87s -> 1619.87s]  we're trying
[1619.87s -> 1621.87s]  to accommodate for it.
[1621.87s -> 1623.87s]  But it's pretty difficult.
[1623.87s -> 1633.86s]  There's no way you guys
[1633.86s -> 1635.86s]  would even get one anyways.
[1635.86s -> 1639.89s]  Not like it was going to work.
[1639.89s -> 1645.58s]  Chat inputs are now disabled.
[1645.58s -> 1648.78s]  Get a good look. Get a great look.
[1648.78s -> 1650.78s]  Because that's what you're looking at.
[1650.78s -> 1656.16s]  I'm going to make a prediction for you.
[1656.16s -> 1658.16s]  At some point
[1658.16s -> 1660.16s]  during the stream,
[1660.16s -> 1662.16s]  there's going to be a scenario
[1662.16s -> 1664.16s]  where the wind takes something.
[1664.16s -> 1666.16s]  Don't worry.
[1666.16s -> 1668.16s]  We've got plenty of trained staff on board.
[1668.16s -> 1670.16s]  And it looks like you've figured it out.
[1670.16s -> 1672.16s]  You've got the machine moving in the right direction.
[1672.16s -> 1674.16s]  There you go. There you go.
[1674.16s -> 1679.02s]  There you go.
[1679.02s -> 1681.02s]  Come on. You can get one. Please get one.
[1681.02s -> 1684.72s]  This is so insane.
[1684.72s -> 1686.72s]  Two. One.
[1686.72s -> 1692.67s]  Fire!
[1692.67s -> 1696.83s]  That almost went on.
[1696.83s -> 1700.80s]  That's so funny.
[1700.80s -> 1703.30s]  Oh.
[1703.30s -> 1705.98s]  I've got to clear these out.
[1705.98s -> 1711.36s]  I want to make it easy for you.
[1711.36s -> 1716.67s]  Are we ready for commands?
[1716.67s -> 1719.62s]  Are you ready?
[1719.62s -> 1722.05s]  I'm not sure.
[1722.05s -> 1725.57s]  Let's see what happens.
[1725.57s -> 1728.00s]  I just want to see if you get one.
[1728.00s -> 1733.50s]  I want to see if you can get at least two.
[1733.50s -> 1739.97s]  Power. Change the power.
[1739.97s -> 1742.46s]  Come on.
[1742.46s -> 1744.46s]  Don't wait. Don't wait.
[1744.46s -> 1746.83s]  Move it this way.
[1746.83s -> 1748.83s]  This way. Please.
[1748.83s -> 1751.07s]  Make it worth it.
[1751.07s -> 1767.78s]  I have nothing to say.
[1767.78s -> 1775.01s]  This is just fucking hilarious.
[1775.01s -> 1781.66s]  I just like to watch.
[1781.66s -> 1783.66s]  Going for the back left row.
[1783.66s -> 1785.66s]  Interesting choice.
[1785.66s -> 1790.46s]  Let's see if you can do it.
[1790.46s -> 1793.98s]  No. Changing your minds. Collectively.
[1793.98s -> 1795.98s]  I wonder how many of you are actually trying to...
[1795.98s -> 1803.33s]  Nice shot.
[1803.33s -> 1805.33s]  I can't even do it from fucking two feet away.
[1808.58s -> 1810.58s]  People popping balloons.
[1810.58s -> 1812.58s]  The wind is like taking balloons.
[1812.58s -> 1816.10s]  This is going to get ugly.
[1816.10s -> 1818.10s]  I don't know if you can just hear that.
[1818.10s -> 1824.30s]  But there was a very loud crack.
[1824.30s -> 1826.30s]  Right there. Right here.
[1826.30s -> 1837.68s]  Try to get in the middle. Less power.
[1837.68s -> 1840.56s]  I don't want to break it before we're done with it.
[1840.56s -> 1843.18s]  Too high.
[1843.18s -> 1845.68s]  Less power.
[1845.68s -> 1850.22s]  Is more utility.
[1850.22s -> 1852.22s]  This game is really hard at the actual carnival.
[1852.22s -> 1854.22s]  Let alone one that's controlled by
[1854.22s -> 1856.22s]  600 million people right now.
[1856.22s -> 1861.97s]  I don't think you're going to do it.
[1861.97s -> 1866.51s]  I don't think so.
[1866.51s -> 1872.98s]  You know, I probably shouldn't be standing here.
[1872.98s -> 1874.98s]  That's giving like 60% of the people a target.
[1883.04s -> 1886.37s]  The last one was here.
[1886.37s -> 1888.37s]  That next one was here.
[1888.37s -> 1890.37s]  You got to pull it in a little.
[1890.37s -> 1892.37s]  Just a hair tighter.
[1892.37s -> 1894.37s]  You want it like here.
[1894.37s -> 1896.37s]  Right there. Right here.
[1896.37s -> 1898.37s]  You want it right here.
[1898.37s -> 1900.37s]  You want it right here.
[1900.37s -> 1907.98s]  This game is not complete.
[1907.98s -> 1910.67s]  Welcome to the carnival.
[1910.67s -> 1913.42s]  Nothing is winnable.
[1913.42s -> 1919.82s]  I want to see one.
[1919.82s -> 1929.09s]  Get the fuck off me.
[1929.09s -> 1932.93s]  Now you overdid it.
[1932.93s -> 1934.93s]  You overdid it by like
[1934.93s -> 1936.93s]  100%.
[1936.93s -> 1938.93s]  Now you under did it by like
[1938.93s -> 1942.83s]  100%.
[1942.83s -> 1944.83s]  Remember your commands are only accepted when it's a green light.
[1944.83s -> 1948.54s]  I ain't going to touch anything.
[1948.54s -> 1955.20s]  I'm going to hold this thing down.
[1955.20s -> 1957.20s]  Look, I'll aim for my fucking face.
[1957.20s -> 1959.20s]  We'll make it easy for you.
[1959.20s -> 1961.20s]  Just aim right for my teeth.
[1961.20s -> 1963.70s]  And then you'll get it.
[1963.70s -> 1965.70s]  60% of people that want to hit the streamer in the face with a rock.
[1965.70s -> 1967.70s]  Just go ahead. Right here.
[1967.70s -> 1970.90s]  Right in my face.
[1970.90s -> 1972.90s]  You can do it. You can do it.
[1972.90s -> 1979.23s]  I know you can.
[1979.23s -> 1981.23s]  Damn it. You had a chance.
[1981.23s -> 1985.89s]  You had a chance.
[1985.89s -> 1989.92s]  Oh shit.
[1989.92s -> 1992.80s]  It's coming this way.
[1992.80s -> 2002.59s]  It's going to be like a tornado in the background.
[2002.59s -> 2005.15s]  Get away from me.
[2005.15s -> 2013.26s]  You're ruining my carnival.
[2013.26s -> 2015.26s]  Right here. I like it.
[2015.26s -> 2017.26s]  I like the idea.
[2017.26s -> 2022.38s]  I can even body if I have to.
[2022.38s -> 2025.20s]  Unwinnable.
[2025.20s -> 2031.79s]  Good luck.
[2031.79s -> 2033.79s]  This is going to fly forward and it's going to take up the whole table.
[2033.79s -> 2035.79s]  So I am only here.
[2035.79s -> 2037.79s]  I'm just going to T-pose over here to make sure this doesn't happen.
[2037.79s -> 2051.09s]  There you go.
[2051.09s -> 2053.09s]  No, no, no. A little more. A little more. A little more.
[2053.09s -> 2057.42s]  You're going too far.
[2057.42s -> 2059.42s]  I think that's good.
[2059.42s -> 2061.42s]  Don't listen to me though.
[2061.42s -> 2065.78s]  I'm a liar.
[2065.78s -> 2068.91s]  I like collecting rings.
[2068.91s -> 2083.63s]  By the way, you win this.
[2083.63s -> 2085.63s]  You win.
[2085.63s -> 2087.63s]  It's kind of rolled all over the ground.
[2087.63s -> 2089.63s]  It's a goat. It's a prize. That's what you're looking for.
[2089.63s -> 2093.22s]  You just got to get one.
[2093.22s -> 2095.84s]  I would laugh so hard if it's not even one.
[2095.84s -> 2097.84s]  It would be great.
[2097.84s -> 2102.19s]  It would prove just my total superiority.
[2102.19s -> 2112.74s]  Let's try it again.
[2112.74s -> 2115.81s]  Too much.
[2115.81s -> 2117.81s]  You guys go too far or too little.
[2117.81s -> 2119.81s]  You got to go like that sweet spot.
[2119.81s -> 2121.81s]  And you got to try to hit it right in the middle.
[2121.81s -> 2123.81s]  So bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, land.
[2123.81s -> 2125.81s]  And even if it doesn't, it's hard to do.
[2125.81s -> 2128.69s]  It's hard to do.
[2128.69s -> 2130.69s]  Pay no attention to the guy that's putting his hand in here.
[2130.69s -> 2133.44s]  Remember, this is just to teach you how this works.
[2133.44s -> 2135.44s]  What did I do?
[2135.44s -> 2137.44s]  I think I fucked up.
[2137.44s -> 2139.94s]  This is a lesson because there are six more games
[2139.94s -> 2141.94s]  coming up here after this.
[2141.94s -> 2144.50s]  This is the tutorial.
[2144.50s -> 2146.50s]  And you failed the tutorial.
[2146.50s -> 2148.50s]  You know how you guys give me shit all the time from messing up tutorials?
[2148.50s -> 2151.70s]  You guys failed it.
[2151.70s -> 2154.51s]  I was really thinking you were going to get at least one.
[2154.51s -> 2157.33s]  Go back and redo the tutorial.
[2157.33s -> 2162.32s]  See?
[2162.32s -> 2164.56s]  See?
[2164.56s -> 2166.93s]  I just did it.
[2166.93s -> 2168.93s]  It's really not that hard.
[2168.93s -> 2170.93s]  You have to do it like 60 or 70 times in a row
[2170.93s -> 2175.41s]  with varying degrees and angles.
[2175.41s -> 2178.80s]  I think this will be the one.
[2178.80s -> 2180.80s]  I think you're going to go harder than that.
[2180.80s -> 2182.80s]  Remember, it's a mallet that is dropping.
[2182.80s -> 2184.80s]  You're pulling the mallet back to land on the platform
[2184.80s -> 2186.80s]  to launch the ring.
[2186.80s -> 2188.80s]  So use the force that is there, Luke.
[2188.80s -> 2195.07s]  God damn it.
[2195.07s -> 2197.07s]  Unfortunately, you still can't get it.
[2197.07s -> 2199.07s]  By this point, you guys have already spent
[2199.07s -> 2201.07s]  probably like $400 or $500 on this.
[2201.07s -> 2203.07s]  And that goes directly to me.
[2203.07s -> 2205.31s]  That goes directly to me.
[2205.31s -> 2211.18s]  So I'm going to give you guys
[2211.18s -> 2213.42s]  I'm going to give you guys a shotgun here.
[2213.42s -> 2215.60s]  Can you shotgun blast this and land on one?
[2215.60s -> 2217.60s]  We've got like five rings loaded up.
[2217.60s -> 2219.60s]  And then you're going to have to move on.
[2219.60s -> 2221.60s]  It's just you guys can't do it.
[2221.60s -> 2223.60s]  It's very imminent.
[2223.60s -> 2225.60s]  Come on.
[2225.60s -> 2227.60s]  We'll see if we can shot.
[2227.60s -> 2229.90s]  This is going to hit me.
[2229.90s -> 2235.92s]  I should probably back up.
[2235.92s -> 2237.92s]  I don't think I should be over here.
[2237.92s -> 2243.23s]  I'm going to get it in the eye.
[2243.23s -> 2248.99s]  Can you get one?
[2248.99s -> 2255.44s]  Why am I squinting?
[2255.44s -> 2257.44s]  Honestly, it doesn't matter where you put it.
[2257.44s -> 2259.44s]  It's just going to go.
[2259.44s -> 2265.89s]  Oh, shit.
[2265.89s -> 2267.89s]  Not even fucking close.
[2267.89s -> 2269.89s]  Not even close.
[2269.89s -> 2272.19s]  You failed the first game.
[2272.19s -> 2274.19s]  You can't even do the first game.
[2274.19s -> 2276.19s]  Well, all right.
[2276.19s -> 2278.19s]  So what's going to happen here
[2278.19s -> 2280.19s]  is I'm sorry you don't win this.
[2280.19s -> 2282.50s]  I don't even know where that went.
[2282.50s -> 2284.50s]  Who cares?
[2284.50s -> 2286.50s]  What we're going to do now is I'm going to give you guys
[2286.50s -> 2288.80s]  a special little treat here.
[2288.80s -> 2291.10s]  I'm going to give you guys a little treat.
[2291.10s -> 2298.21s]  We're going to move on.
[2298.21s -> 2301.15s]  What kind of carnival exists
[2301.15s -> 2303.97s]  without, of course,
[2303.97s -> 2306.72s]  some delicious,
[2306.72s -> 2309.60s]  nutritious,
[2309.60s -> 2312.16s]  potentially illness-causing,
[2312.16s -> 2314.16s]  bacteria-infested
[2314.16s -> 2316.16s]  cotton candy?
[2316.16s -> 2318.16s]  That's right.
[2318.16s -> 2320.16s]  I'm going to need somebody, one of you guys,
[2320.16s -> 2322.16s]  one of the people in the chat are going to have to come up here.
[2322.16s -> 2324.16s]  Does anybody,
[2324.16s -> 2327.23s]  does anybody want any cotton candy?
[2327.23s -> 2329.73s]  You'd like some?
[2329.73s -> 2331.73s]  Son, you over there? Why don't you come on over here, son?
[2331.73s -> 2333.73s]  I am going to make you a special treat.
[2333.73s -> 2336.99s]  I have trained
[2336.99s -> 2338.99s]  in this, son.
[2338.99s -> 2340.99s]  Is this your brother?
[2340.99s -> 2342.99s]  Daniel? Daniel, good to see you.
[2342.99s -> 2345.23s]  So I have trained
[2345.23s -> 2347.73s]  in the art of making
[2347.73s -> 2349.73s]  cotton candy.
[2349.73s -> 2351.73s]  I can't.
[2351.73s -> 2355.94s]  I can't.
[2355.94s -> 2357.94s]  I hope it's just fucking
[2357.94s -> 2359.94s]  shattered. Oh, shit.
[2359.94s -> 2363.07s]  Okay, so,
[2363.07s -> 2365.07s]  alright, so everything is good to go.
[2365.07s -> 2368.53s]  How big do you want it, son?
[2368.53s -> 2370.53s]  How big? You want it big?
[2370.53s -> 2372.53s]  I can do that for you.
[2372.53s -> 2375.60s]  All you can hear is probably a loud noise.
[2375.60s -> 2378.67s]  Does mom want
[2378.67s -> 2384.18s]  one too?
[2384.18s -> 2386.18s]  Alright, I have actually been trained in this.
[2386.18s -> 2388.35s]  Let's get a good, nice, big
[2388.35s -> 2390.35s]  surprise for you.
[2390.35s -> 2396.62s]  This is not
[2396.62s -> 2398.62s]  what I thought was going to happen.
[2398.62s -> 2401.12s]  Alright, I'm not very good.
[2401.12s -> 2407.97s]  I'll get a big one for you and your brother.
[2407.97s -> 2409.97s]  I have no fucking idea how to do this.
[2409.97s -> 2411.97s]  I read the instructions.
[2411.97s -> 2413.97s]  Very, very quickly.
[2413.97s -> 2418.75s]  This thing's going to
[2418.75s -> 2420.75s]  fly off.
[2420.75s -> 2422.75s]  Okay.
[2422.75s -> 2424.75s]  Well, hey.
[2424.75s -> 2426.75s]  There you go.
[2426.75s -> 2428.75s]  There you go.
[2428.75s -> 2430.75s]  Son, this one's for you.
[2430.75s -> 2432.75s]  There you go. Take it. There you go.
[2435.63s -> 2437.63s]  So, oh, Jesus Christ.
[2437.63s -> 2439.63s]  Alright, go home.
[2439.63s -> 2441.63s]  Do you want one too?
[2441.63s -> 2445.47s]  Would you like one too?
[2445.47s -> 2448.67s]  I'm going to get like burnt.
[2448.67s -> 2450.67s]  No, no, no, no.
[2450.67s -> 2459.89s]  Don't do that.
[2459.89s -> 2462.06s]  Just like
[2462.06s -> 2464.06s]  mom used to make.
[2464.06s -> 2466.50s]  Alright. Just like mom
[2466.50s -> 2473.86s]  used to make. I taste soap.
[2473.86s -> 2475.86s]  I don't know why. I don't know why.
[2475.86s -> 2483.71s]  It tastes soapy to me.
[2483.71s -> 2487.55s]  I can't believe you fucking.
[2487.55s -> 2490.05s]  It's delicious.
[2490.05s -> 2492.86s]  Oh, let me get some more.
[2492.86s -> 2501.23s]  Here we go. Okay.
[2501.23s -> 2503.23s]  Well, I'm going to give you
[2503.23s -> 2505.23s]  a double there, son.
[2505.23s -> 2510.35s]  If you would like to take that.
[2510.35s -> 2515.09s]  That's like a bug
[2515.09s -> 2521.09s]  zapper.
[2521.09s -> 2523.71s]  Alright. Look at that.
[2523.71s -> 2527.17s]  Imagine you
[2527.17s -> 2529.60s]  got this at the carnival.
[2529.60s -> 2531.60s]  I'd be like, I would fucking return it.
[2531.60s -> 2533.60s]  Can you return cotton candy?
[2533.60s -> 2537.63s]  That's like
[2537.63s -> 2539.63s]  so shitty. That's so bad.
[2544.37s -> 2546.37s]  Oh, God. This is bad.
[2546.37s -> 2548.37s]  This is bad. No, this is not an injury.
[2548.37s -> 2550.37s]  Come here. Come here.
[2550.37s -> 2552.37s]  Bring your brother too. Come here. This is not an injury.
[2552.37s -> 2554.37s]  People think
[2554.37s -> 2556.37s]  I got like a cut. No, it's cotton candy.
[2556.37s -> 2558.67s]  Relax.
[2558.67s -> 2563.60s]  It's going to be fine. Alright.
[2563.60s -> 2566.80s]  That looks good.
[2566.80s -> 2568.80s]  I'm going to need a shower after this, I think.
[2568.80s -> 2575.07s]  That probably looks disgusting.
[2575.07s -> 2577.31s]  I don't know if you can hear anything I'm saying right now
[2577.31s -> 2579.74s]  because there's a loud machine over here.
[2579.74s -> 2582.18s]  So coming up next.
[2582.18s -> 2584.18s]  Oh, there's more. There's more. This ain't it.
[2584.18s -> 2586.61s]  Sprint $645
[2586.61s -> 2588.61s]  million on this fucking project.
[2588.61s -> 2591.42s]  I don't know
[2591.42s -> 2593.42s]  if I should turn it off.
[2593.42s -> 2595.92s]  Coming up next is
[2595.92s -> 2598.29s]  what do we got next? That's a good question.
[2598.29s -> 2601.36s]  I'm going to have to take this off.
[2601.36s -> 2603.36s]  What a great like fucking joke.
[2603.36s -> 2605.86s]  I made shitty cotton candy for five minutes.
[2605.86s -> 2608.22s]  Wonderful.
[2608.22s -> 2610.85s]  Don't put your hand in here by the way. That's dangerous.
[2610.85s -> 2613.15s]  Like I'm doing.
[2613.15s -> 2615.15s]  I'm a professional. There's like 15
[2615.15s -> 2617.15s]  people on staff here.
[2617.15s -> 2620.35s]  They've taught me how to do this. Don't worry.
[2620.35s -> 2626.94s]  Actually pretty good. Where are we going next?
[2626.94s -> 2629.31s]  We are going
[2629.31s -> 2631.31s]  to another game.
[2631.31s -> 2633.31s]  That game is
[2633.31s -> 2635.31s]  I've forgotten the game. Tell me what it is in my ear
[2635.31s -> 2637.31s]  because I don't fucking remember. I sweat.
[2637.31s -> 2642.05s]  We're going to frog launch.
[2642.05s -> 2644.42s]  Launching frogs.
[2644.42s -> 2655.22s]  I'll see you over there.
[2655.22s -> 2662.56s]  So
[2662.56s -> 2664.93s]  in this game, this is another
[2664.93s -> 2666.93s]  hard one.
[2666.93s -> 2668.93s]  We've updated the graphics because they were
[2668.93s -> 2671.10s]  incorrect on the last one. So the
[2671.10s -> 2673.10s]  graphics have been updated.
[2673.10s -> 2675.10s]  I'm going to need like a cup of water
[2675.10s -> 2677.10s]  if it's possible.
[2677.10s -> 2679.10s]  Actually it'll probably help you because these things
[2679.10s -> 2682.24s]  are probably going to stick. So we have
[2686.06s -> 2688.06s]  Hold on. I'm just going to put it over here.
[2688.06s -> 2691.71s]  We have these frogs as you know.
[2691.71s -> 2693.71s]  Frogs are here.
[2693.71s -> 2695.71s]  Your goal is to land
[2695.71s -> 2697.71s]  these on the lily pads.
[2697.71s -> 2699.71s]  You remember this one from when you were a kid?
[2699.71s -> 2701.71s]  I do. So if you
[2701.71s -> 2703.71s]  land on a lily pad,
[2703.71s -> 2706.45s]  you win. If not,
[2706.45s -> 2708.45s]  then you lose.
[2708.45s -> 2710.45s]  So this one is probably going to be
[2710.45s -> 2712.45s]  like five times harder
[2712.45s -> 2714.45s]  than the last one. So I would be surprised
[2714.45s -> 2716.45s]  again if anybody
[2716.45s -> 2718.45s]  got this at all. I mean
[2718.45s -> 2720.45s]  it's the first couple of just like impossible.
[2720.45s -> 2722.45s]  And I thought it would be kind of funny
[2722.45s -> 2724.45s]  if we made the games like just fucking
[2724.45s -> 2726.45s]  uncompletable. But then out of
[2726.45s -> 2728.45s]  thank you sir. Thank you. If you could just
[2728.45s -> 2730.45s]  dump that on my hands. That would be wonderful.
[2730.45s -> 2732.45s]  Alright. There we go. Just a little bit
[2732.45s -> 2734.45s]  of you taping that. Okay.
[2734.45s -> 2736.45s]  Not sure why you filmed that.
[2736.45s -> 2738.45s]  Not sure why you had to get that on camera.
[2738.45s -> 2740.45s]  But I had to have that happen.
[2740.45s -> 2742.45s]  Anyway, so you got to land the frogs on the
[2742.45s -> 2744.45s]  lily pads. The controls have been updated.
[2744.45s -> 2746.45s]  They may have been incorrect before.
[2746.45s -> 2748.45s]  But it's a live goddamn show. Okay.
[2748.45s -> 2750.45s]  This is all happening live right now.
[2750.45s -> 2752.45s]  And you haven't seen anything like this before.
[2752.45s -> 2757.38s]  I've never seen...
[2757.38s -> 2759.38s]  Okay. We're good. We're good. The ground
[2759.38s -> 2761.38s]  just moved. So
[2761.38s -> 2763.38s]  again, you have the controls on the screen.
[2763.38s -> 2765.38s]  You launch on the frogs, land on a lily pad. If you land
[2765.38s -> 2767.38s]  on a lily pad, the game ends. By the way.
[2767.38s -> 2769.81s]  You win the game. Good luck.
[2769.81s -> 2772.05s]  You're going to need it. Because we've actually
[2772.05s -> 2774.05s]  tested this like a
[2774.05s -> 2776.05s]  dozen times and I don't think anyone has been able to do this once.
[2776.05s -> 2778.05s]  Back to back we're giving you hard ones.
[2778.05s -> 2780.05s]  This is the new one of the hard mode.
[2780.05s -> 2782.05s]  You've got it. Watch the timer
[2782.05s -> 2784.05s]  on the screen. Chat. Commands are only accepted
[2784.05s -> 2788.27s]  in the green light. You've got to get that
[2788.27s -> 2790.27s]  frog on a lily pad.
[2790.27s -> 2792.70s]  Hopefully in the
[2792.70s -> 2797.89s]  air too. Fucking cotton candy.
[2797.89s -> 2799.89s]  That was such a
[2799.89s -> 2803.02s]  waste of time. It actually was not that
[2803.02s -> 2805.02s]  bad. It did taste a little bit like soap. Of course, hit the streamer.
[2805.02s -> 2808.22s]  I won't move.
[2808.22s -> 2810.22s]  It'll hit me right in the face. It'll hit me directly in the face.
[2810.22s -> 2812.85s]  I don't care. Do it.
[2812.85s -> 2817.12s]  Come on. Come on. Do it.
[2817.12s -> 2819.62s]  You want to make that joke so bad.
[2819.62s -> 2821.79s]  You actually did it.
[2821.79s -> 2823.97s]  I actually can't fucking believe
[2823.97s -> 2825.97s]  you did that.
[2840.10s -> 2842.10s]  I mean, did it hurt? Yeah.
[2842.10s -> 2844.10s]  Am I going to cry about it? No.
[2844.10s -> 2849.66s]  Maybe not.
[2849.66s -> 2853.89s]  That was a direct fucking hit.
[2853.89s -> 2855.89s]  Unfucking believable. Anyways, now
[2855.89s -> 2857.89s]  could you play the actual game?
[2857.89s -> 2859.89s]  That would be fantastic.
[2859.89s -> 2863.84s]  Come on.
[2863.84s -> 2865.84s]  You've got to land on a lily pad.
[2865.84s -> 2870.06s]  Ooh.
[2870.06s -> 2872.24s]  Too much.
[2872.24s -> 2874.24s]  Too much. I got some for you
[2874.24s -> 2876.48s]  if you need them. You got enough back there?
[2876.48s -> 2878.78s]  I'll just toss them in the box. I'll toss them in the box
[2878.78s -> 2880.78s]  so they get them. Oh, God.
[2880.78s -> 2885.07s]  Wind, you're ruining my whole show.
[2885.07s -> 2888.02s]  Hey, let me show you how easy this is.
[2888.02s -> 2895.62s]  Pretty easy.
[2895.62s -> 2897.62s]  We thought it was going to rain. You understand?
[2897.62s -> 2899.62s]  So, like, I'm not sure what's worse.
[2899.62s -> 2901.62s]  If it rains, then the whole thing
[2901.62s -> 2903.62s]  has to be canceled. But if it's wind,
[2903.62s -> 2905.62s]  then you have to compensate for the wind like a
[2905.62s -> 2907.62s]  golfer. You ever play golf? You go to the
[2907.62s -> 2909.62s]  driving range, you have to compensate for the wind?
[2909.62s -> 2911.62s]  You have to do that here. I'll give you a good
[2911.62s -> 2913.62s]  example, right? I'll throw it in the air so you can see.
[2913.62s -> 2915.62s]  See, there you go. Wind's going that way.
[2915.62s -> 2917.62s]  Just so you know. Wind's going that way. And it's on the bot now.
[2917.62s -> 2921.26s]  You have...
[2921.26s -> 2923.26s]  That scared me.
[2923.26s -> 2926.21s]  I got actually startled.
[2926.21s -> 2928.21s]  I actually just got scared by that, so
[2928.21s -> 2935.82s]  it's coming up all over the place.
[2935.82s -> 2938.26s]  Oh, we got rings, we got frogs.
[2938.26s -> 2942.03s]  It is possible, as you see.
[2942.03s -> 2944.03s]  Fuck, I forgot to prove that.
[2944.03s -> 2946.40s]  I'm supposed to prove that it's a possible game.
[2946.40s -> 2948.40s]  This is, by the way, it's too hot out here.
[2948.40s -> 2950.64s]  It's time for me to de-robe. And just be in
[2950.64s -> 2952.64s]  my fucked up train
[2952.64s -> 2957.57s]  conductor outfit. Okay, that's not
[2957.57s -> 2959.57s]  going to be in the... Okay, that's good. I don't want to be shown
[2959.57s -> 2961.57s]  the whole fucking blue man shirt. Wait, oh,
[2961.57s -> 2963.74s]  I think I just ripped out my mic.
[2963.74s -> 2966.75s]  Can production staff still hear me?
[2966.75s -> 2969.44s]  Can you still hear me? I think I may have ripped the mic up.
[2969.44s -> 2971.44s]  Okay, good. You guys can hear me. Okay, let me
[2971.44s -> 2976.35s]  help you. Too high.
[2976.35s -> 2978.35s]  You gotta find that spot. If you guys find
[2978.35s -> 2980.35s]  a spot that lands on the table,
[2980.35s -> 2982.91s]  if you find
[2982.91s -> 2984.91s]  a spot on the table, you want to try to keep it there.
[2984.91s -> 2986.91s]  You guys are moving it too much.
[2986.91s -> 2994.64s]  I should put my head down there. I should put
[2994.64s -> 2996.64s]  my face down there so you guys actually do it.
[2996.64s -> 3002.46s]  Oh, shit. I forgot.
[3002.46s -> 3008.67s]  That's too easy.
[3008.67s -> 3015.97s]  Right in the middle. Good, good, good.
[3015.97s -> 3019.47s]  Good. Good.
[3019.47s -> 3021.47s]  More, more, more power.
[3021.47s -> 3023.90s]  More power. Oh!
[3023.90s -> 3028.26s]  If I were you,
[3028.26s -> 3030.82s]  I would aim for the bigger ones.
[3030.82s -> 3033.12s]  Because, I mean, these are
[3033.12s -> 3035.12s]  smaller. If you go to the carnival,
[3035.12s -> 3037.12s]  they're gonna try to get you to throw it on the smaller ones.
[3037.12s -> 3039.12s]  Use your thinking phases. Use your
[3039.12s -> 3041.12s]  6000 IQ. Put it on the big one.
[3041.12s -> 3047.26s]  These don't count, by the way. These frogs.
[3047.26s -> 3049.26s]  They're just there for fun.
[3049.26s -> 3051.63s]  And to squeak when I need to.
[3051.63s -> 3053.63s]  Like that. See?
[3053.63s -> 3055.63s]  You want to get them all? I'll do them all.
[3055.63s -> 3059.54s]  One more? This one sucks.
[3059.54s -> 3064.96s]  Replace them. It's not good enough
[3064.96s -> 3069.63s]  on camera. Alright.
[3069.63s -> 3082.10s]  Is it gonna be enough?
[3082.10s -> 3084.72s]  Almost at it. That was right
[3084.72s -> 3087.73s]  there. Almost there.
[3087.73s -> 3090.80s]  You had an opportunity.
[3090.80s -> 3094.51s]  I wonder if you guys are gonna be able
[3094.51s -> 3096.88s]  to do any of these. I bet you
[3096.88s -> 3099.25s]  I bet you you don't do one.
[3099.25s -> 3101.25s]  And by the way, the dunk tank
[3101.25s -> 3103.25s]  is coming up. So, good luck with that one.
[3103.25s -> 3105.25s]  I don't think you're gonna be able to do that one either.
[3105.25s -> 3107.74s]  I hope you proved me wrong today.
[3107.74s -> 3116.88s]  I can't believe it. Ah!
[3116.88s -> 3118.88s]  By the way, if it bounces and lands,
[3118.88s -> 3120.88s]  it counts. That does count.
[3120.88s -> 3122.88s]  If we go from here to here,
[3122.88s -> 3124.88s]  you just have to land on it. It counts.
[3124.88s -> 3132.43s]  It is really hard though.
[3132.43s -> 3134.80s]  When we were thinking about these games,
[3134.80s -> 3136.80s]  when we were designing them, when we were going back and forth
[3136.80s -> 3138.80s]  with Andy Mark, we were trying to figure out
[3138.80s -> 3140.80s]  like, hey, what can we do? We don't want them just to win.
[3140.80s -> 3142.80s]  Immediately.
[3142.80s -> 3146.96s]  Hi, I see. Yeah, I know.
[3146.96s -> 3148.96s]  I know. You're gonna go for it again? I won't move.
[3148.96s -> 3150.96s]  You think I'm scared? No.
[3150.96s -> 3154.93s]  Have you realized that you can't win?
[3154.93s -> 3160.69s]  Okay. I may have just
[3160.69s -> 3167.15s]  cheated.
[3167.15s -> 3169.15s]  That was getting close.
[3169.15s -> 3171.15s]  But I may have just influenced that a little.
[3171.15s -> 3173.15s]  Now that was right here.
[3173.15s -> 3175.15s]  It was going right here.
[3175.15s -> 3178.35s]  Don't give me that bullshit.
[3178.35s -> 3180.35s]  Can I take this hat off yet?
[3180.35s -> 3184.90s]  It makes me look like a dickhead.
[3184.90s -> 3188.03s]  No, that's worse.
[3188.03s -> 3191.94s]  I think it might be worse.
[3191.94s -> 3193.94s]  Don't invite me anywhere.
[3193.94s -> 3195.94s]  I'm a scary person.
[3195.94s -> 3201.12s]  What's worse?
[3201.12s -> 3203.12s]  I'm using the production monitor as a mirror.
[3203.12s -> 3205.12s]  That's how much of a vain fuck I am.
[3205.12s -> 3209.22s]  Oh.
[3209.22s -> 3211.22s]  I'm paying attention to the game.
[3211.22s -> 3213.97s]  What do I look like right now?
[3213.97s -> 3215.97s]  Do I look okay?
[3215.97s -> 3218.53s]  Let me see. Okay, nice.
[3218.53s -> 3220.53s]  What's that? What's that? Yeah?
[3220.53s -> 3222.53s]  Yeah, okay. I got you. Roger that.
[3222.53s -> 3228.54s]  I'm not fucking bald.
[3228.54s -> 3230.54s]  I see it. I can see the emotes right now.
[3230.54s -> 3232.54s]  Cut that out or I'll fucking ban you.
[3232.54s -> 3234.54s]  You wanna get banned from the carnival?
[3234.54s -> 3236.54s]  There's two ways to get banned from a carnival.
[3236.54s -> 3238.54s]  One is to puke on a ride.
[3238.54s -> 3240.54s]  And two is by
[3240.54s -> 3242.54s]  riding the ride too many times in a row.
[3242.54s -> 3244.54s]  Because they get sick of you.
[3244.54s -> 3246.54s]  I know this because I did it.
[3246.54s -> 3248.54s]  I didn't puke on a ride.
[3248.54s -> 3253.09s]  I rode a ride too many times in a row.
[3253.09s -> 3255.09s]  Because I bought like 150 tickets
[3255.09s -> 3257.09s]  and they just like, you can't do this like
[3257.09s -> 3260.35s]  fucking 20 times in a row. So I was like alright fine.
[3260.35s -> 3263.74s]  So I left.
[3263.74s -> 3265.74s]  I was just getting back and they were sick of seeing me.
[3265.74s -> 3268.75s]  They thought I like stole them.
[3268.75s -> 3270.75s]  All the tickets. And I'm like I didn't fucking do that.
[3270.75s -> 3272.75s]  I paid good money for this.
[3272.75s -> 3275.82s]  I don't wanna influence that. I'll take it off.
[3275.82s -> 3280.88s]  Something going on
[3280.88s -> 3286.77s]  that way. You guys have
[3286.77s -> 3289.01s]  You seem to have figured out the controls though.
[3289.01s -> 3292.85s]  I like that.
[3292.85s -> 3294.85s]  You gotta go for the middle ones.
[3294.85s -> 3297.41s]  Have you done?
[3297.41s -> 3299.41s]  No. No.
[3299.41s -> 3302.53s]  No. That's safe in baseball.
[3302.53s -> 3305.22s]  You're out. You can get a photo of it
[3305.22s -> 3307.22s]  if you want. Get a photo of it. Cause that's no.
[3307.22s -> 3311.89s]  The foot don't count. No you gotta get the whole thing on.
[3311.89s -> 3314.70s]  That doesn't count.
[3314.70s -> 3316.70s]  It's gotta be on the actual pad itself.
[3316.70s -> 3321.63s]  That doesn't count. That doesn't get you anything.
[3321.63s -> 3324.32s]  That gets you a
[3324.32s -> 3327.07s]  nice try. Not a hole.
[3327.07s -> 3331.62s]  It's not rigged. It's not.
[3331.62s -> 3333.62s]  It's not rigged.
[3333.62s -> 3335.62s]  Where have you ever been to a carnival before?
[3335.62s -> 3337.62s]  I know you've been to a carnival.
[3337.62s -> 3339.62s]  I know you've never been to a carnival but I have.
[3339.62s -> 3341.62s]  Everyone's been to a carnival.
[3341.62s -> 3343.62s]  How have you not been to a carnival?
[3343.62s -> 3345.62s]  I'm projecting on you. I don't know why.
[3345.62s -> 3347.62s]  Everybody that's been to a carnival knows
[3347.62s -> 3349.62s]  you have to get it.
[3349.62s -> 3351.62s]  There's a very specific area you have to get it on.
[3351.62s -> 3357.70s]  That don't count.
[3357.70s -> 3360.96s]  You didn't win shit.
[3360.96s -> 3362.96s]  Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[3362.96s -> 3364.96s]  What are you guys pretending?
[3364.96s -> 3366.96s]  Are you guys pretending?
[3366.96s -> 3368.96s]  Stop. Stop pretending chat.
[3368.96s -> 3370.96s]  Right?
[3370.96s -> 3372.96s]  Stop pretending.
[3372.96s -> 3374.96s]  You doing this hard thing
[3374.96s -> 3376.96s]  that's really hard to do
[3376.96s -> 3378.96s]  and you can't do it?
[3378.96s -> 3380.96s]  Stop fucking pretending chat.
[3380.96s -> 3383.65s]  You know what I'm saying? Quit pretending.
[3383.65s -> 3387.62s]  Let's go.
[3387.62s -> 3389.62s]  Get it done now.
[3389.62s -> 3412.37s]  Oops. Double.
[3412.37s -> 3423.23s]  Not enough. Didn't count.
[3423.23s -> 3425.23s]  I love this so much.
[3425.23s -> 3427.23s]  This is amazing.
[3427.23s -> 3429.73s]  I love watching you guys try to do something
[3429.73s -> 3431.73s]  and you can't do it.
[3431.73s -> 3433.73s]  And I just get to sit here. I get to be the backseat gamer
[3433.73s -> 3435.97s]  because I know how to do this.
[3435.97s -> 3437.97s]  And I just get to watch you guys fail
[3437.97s -> 3439.97s]  over and over again.
[3439.97s -> 3441.97s]  I get to watch you guys suffer through Dark Souls 3
[3441.97s -> 3443.97s]  which I beat on stream.
[3443.97s -> 3445.97s]  I did the DLC too if you weren't curious.
[3445.97s -> 3447.97s]  I know some of the new viewers that don't know that I beat it on stream.
[3447.97s -> 3449.97s]  I play Demon's Souls.
[3449.97s -> 3451.97s]  I beat it on stream.
[3451.97s -> 3453.97s]  Beat Demon's Souls on stream for me.
[3453.97s -> 3463.12s]  Come on. Let's go.
[3463.12s -> 3465.12s]  That jumped up
[3465.12s -> 3471.52s]  and then fell.
[3471.52s -> 3473.52s]  We're going to leave that there.
[3473.52s -> 3476.72s]  We'll get a referee to verify that.
[3476.72s -> 3478.72s]  By the way, completely independent
[3478.72s -> 3480.72s]  of anything going on here that I have hired
[3480.72s -> 3482.72s]  to bring on.
[3482.72s -> 3484.72s]  Completely independent
[3484.72s -> 3486.72s]  third party reviewer that I have brought on.
[3486.72s -> 3488.72s]  I have hired.
[3488.72s -> 3495.10s]  By the way, it's me.
[3495.10s -> 3499.70s]  Do it.
[3499.70s -> 3503.47s]  I know you can.
[3503.47s -> 3506.35s]  I'm certain you guys can.
[3506.35s -> 3508.35s]  Right in the middle. Right in the middle.
[3508.35s -> 3510.35s]  You gotta up, down. Pull it back a little bit.
[3510.35s -> 3512.35s]  Work together on this shit.
[3512.35s -> 3514.35s]  Work together on this.
[3514.35s -> 3516.35s]  You were right here. You were literally right here.
[3516.35s -> 3518.35s]  Now just pull it back.
[3518.35s -> 3520.35s]  Don't even move the fucking thing.
[3520.35s -> 3522.35s]  Just pull it back like a little bit of power.
[3522.35s -> 3524.35s]  Don't go forward.
[3524.35s -> 3526.59s]  You got it.
[3526.59s -> 3530.56s]  Work together.
[3530.56s -> 3532.99s]  There you go. There you go.
[3532.99s -> 3536.51s]  Don't turn it. Don't turn it.
[3536.51s -> 3538.94s]  Somebody fucked it up. Who did it?
[3538.94s -> 3544.70s]  Who screwed that up?
[3544.70s -> 3553.41s]  It was me. It was me.
[3553.41s -> 3555.41s]  Too much. Way too much.
[3555.41s -> 3557.41s]  You had it right there. You just had to pull it back a little bit.
[3557.41s -> 3559.41s]  I think there might be some pranksters in the chat.
[3559.41s -> 3561.90s]  There might be some people joking around too much.
[3561.90s -> 3564.40s]  No, it was right here.
[3564.40s -> 3566.70s]  You had it.
[3566.70s -> 3568.70s]  Blame the people in chat that didn't follow along.
[3568.70s -> 3572.99s]  That's what I blame.
[3572.99s -> 3575.74s]  No, that's just extra cotton candy.
[3575.74s -> 3578.75s]  I don't have a cut on my arm. Don't worry.
[3578.75s -> 3580.75s]  I just saw it over here and I was like
[3580.75s -> 3583.18s]  get that fucking thing off my head.
[3583.18s -> 3585.18s]  I look like one of those guys
[3585.18s -> 3587.18s]  that goes on surveys.
[3587.18s -> 3589.18s]  This is seriously like a traffic cough shirt.
[3589.18s -> 3591.18s]  I can't take it off though
[3591.18s -> 3593.18s]  because my mic is hooked into it so I can't take it off.
[3593.18s -> 3595.18s]  I have to look like this
[3595.18s -> 3597.18s]  for at least another 30 minutes.
[3597.18s -> 3599.74s]  By the way, look at the glue man shirt. That's available.
[3599.74s -> 3601.74s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3601.74s -> 3603.74s]  It doesn't count.
[3603.74s -> 3605.74s]  You guys got the feet. You got two feet.
[3605.74s -> 3608.30s]  No.
[3608.30s -> 3612.08s]  It does not count.
[3612.08s -> 3616.24s]  No, it doesn't count.
[3616.24s -> 3619.63s]  It needs to land.
[3619.63s -> 3622.45s]  It has to be on the pad.
[3622.45s -> 3624.45s]  Not kind of on the pad. You guys get it together.
[3624.45s -> 3629.12s]  I'll leave it.
[3629.12s -> 3631.12s]  But I'm not going to count it. Why would I do that?
[3631.12s -> 3634.96s]  And now the juggling
[3634.96s -> 3640.66s]  of Terminator 5.
[3640.66s -> 3645.39s]  I have no idea how to do that.
[3645.39s -> 3648.14s]  You guys got to go higher than that. It's too low.
[3648.14s -> 3650.14s]  Although it's not my game so that's not me playing.
[3650.14s -> 3661.84s]  Come on.
[3661.84s -> 3663.84s]  I want you guys to win. I do.
[3663.84s -> 3667.04s]  That's so bad. I am so desperate
[3667.04s -> 3669.54s]  for you to win.
[3669.54s -> 3672.29s]  Because if you don't win any, there's no fun.
[3672.29s -> 3675.23s]  Just keep going until you just do it.
[3675.23s -> 3677.86s]  You have it in the right area.
[3677.86s -> 3680.48s]  I know you're completely capable of it.
[3680.48s -> 3684.00s]  So do it.
[3684.00s -> 3686.62s]  Look.
[3686.62s -> 3693.02s]  The wind is going this way. Do it.
[3693.02s -> 3697.30s]  I have complete faith.
[3697.30s -> 3699.30s]  No, more. Pull it back.
[3699.30s -> 3702.30s]  I'm just trying to help you. That's it.
[3702.30s -> 3705.25s]  Because I'm seeing this the complete desperate.
[3705.25s -> 3707.62s]  Close. That actually was pretty close.
[3707.62s -> 3710.94s]  That was close.
[3710.94s -> 3712.94s]  All of these are so close but so far.
[3712.94s -> 3718.83s]  To a point where
[3718.83s -> 3720.83s]  I don't think it's going to happen.
[3720.83s -> 3722.83s]  I'm pretty sure you guys can't do the first.
[3722.83s -> 3724.83s]  These launching games are the hardest ones probably.
[3724.83s -> 3726.83s]  That's why they're first.
[3726.83s -> 3728.83s]  It's like a training thing.
[3728.83s -> 3730.83s]  I'm the only one holding this.
[3730.83s -> 3732.83s]  I'm trying to train you
[3732.83s -> 3734.83s]  to win the fucking
[3734.83s -> 3736.83s]  carnival game.
[3736.83s -> 3738.83s]  And at the same time, I'm training
[3738.83s -> 3740.83s]  to hold this before it falls down and crushes me.
[3740.83s -> 3743.39s]  Whichever one of those two things happens first,
[3743.39s -> 3750.69s]  we'll find out, won't we?
[3750.69s -> 3752.93s]  Same spot. Same spot
[3752.93s -> 3761.95s]  as the yellow one.
[3761.95s -> 3764.26s]  How much is it usually to do this?
[3764.26s -> 3766.56s]  Five bucks?
[3766.56s -> 3768.56s]  You get three tosses for three or four dollars?
[3768.56s -> 3771.57s]  I think it's something like that.
[3771.57s -> 3773.74s]  What is it? Five dollars for three tosses?
[3773.74s -> 3775.74s]  Three bucks for two tosses?
[3775.74s -> 3779.52s]  Usually?
[3779.52s -> 3781.52s]  This is a different style here. You guys are going for a different style.
[3781.52s -> 3787.09s]  This is the one.
[3787.09s -> 3790.22s]  I'm calling it right now.
[3790.22s -> 3792.78s]  If I hit zero, what's going on?
[3792.78s -> 3797.95s]  I'm certain of it.
[3797.95s -> 3799.95s]  Don't let me down. Don't let me down.
[3799.95s -> 3813.70s]  Right now. You had a chance.
[3813.70s -> 3816.70s]  We are going to do this
[3816.70s -> 3818.70s]  only a few more times
[3818.70s -> 3820.70s]  before you guys have to get thrown out
[3820.70s -> 3822.70s]  of the carnival here.
[3822.70s -> 3824.88s]  There's a line behind you.
[3824.88s -> 3826.88s]  Only a couple more times.
[3826.88s -> 3828.88s]  You guys have a line forming behind you.
[3828.88s -> 3835.60s]  You can't just hog it.
[3835.60s -> 3837.60s]  It is not completable, rigged
[3837.60s -> 3839.90s]  just like a real carnival.
[3839.90s -> 3843.62s]  If you hit it, you get something great.
[3843.62s -> 3845.92s]  I'm going to put that out there.
[3845.92s -> 3851.74s]  They did it!
[3851.74s -> 3854.11s]  They got one!
[3854.11s -> 3856.11s]  You actually did it!
[3856.11s -> 3858.54s]  And of course,
[3858.54s -> 3861.17s]  if you win,
[3861.17s -> 3863.79s]  you get a prize.
[3863.79s -> 3868.13s]  And hey,
[3868.13s -> 3870.62s]  how's this for a prize?
[3870.62s -> 3872.62s]  How's that for a fucking prize?
[3872.62s -> 3876.06s]  You like that one?
[3876.06s -> 3878.06s]  What I have here is some kind of animal.
[3878.06s -> 3881.33s]  Some kind of teeth animal.
[3881.33s -> 3883.82s]  Big grinner.
[3883.82s -> 3887.02s]  I think it's a Pokemon character.
[3887.02s -> 3894.26s]  You'll get it later.
[3894.26s -> 3897.06s]  You did it!
[3897.06s -> 3899.06s]  Actually, that's going to get dirty.
[3899.06s -> 3901.06s]  Do you want to know something funny about that prize?
[3901.06s -> 3903.06s]  By the way, that's for you.
[3903.06s -> 3905.06s]  But it's for me.
[3905.06s -> 3907.81s]  That thing's like a hundred bucks.
[3907.81s -> 3910.74s]  Why? Why the fuck is that thing?
[3910.74s -> 3913.04s]  I can't believe you did it.
[3913.04s -> 3915.98s]  I was getting kind of concerned though.
[3915.98s -> 3917.98s]  After the first one and the wind and everything,
[3917.98s -> 3919.98s]  I'm just sitting here going,
[3919.98s -> 3921.98s]  I'm not going to do this.
[3921.98s -> 3923.98s]  This is going to be impossible.
[3923.98s -> 3925.98s]  But you actually did it.
[3925.98s -> 3929.18s]  And in fact, I have to inspect this because,
[3929.18s -> 3931.62s]  wait a minute, it's not on there all the way.
[3931.62s -> 3933.62s]  I don't think that actually counts.
[3933.62s -> 3935.62s]  I'm not going to touch it.
[3935.62s -> 3937.62s]  No, it does.
[3937.62s -> 3939.62s]  I'll count it.
[3939.62s -> 3941.62s]  I don't want to kind of stifle your victory here.
[3941.62s -> 3943.62s]  So, whale lord is your prize.
[3943.62s -> 3945.62s]  It's going in my office.
[3945.62s -> 3947.62s]  I'm going to hang it up behind a door or something.
[3947.62s -> 3949.62s]  I don't know.
[3949.62s -> 3953.46s]  What we should have done is we should have said,
[3953.46s -> 3955.46s]  if you got four feet,
[3955.46s -> 3957.82s]  then you get a prize.
[3957.82s -> 3959.82s]  Good work. You actually, actually did it.
[3959.82s -> 3961.82s]  I'm so happy about that.
[3961.82s -> 3963.82s]  Can I touch this now?
[3963.82s -> 3965.82s]  Can I put my hands on this?
[3965.82s -> 3967.82s]  Get your photo!
[3967.82s -> 3971.97s]  Give me this thing.
[3971.97s -> 3974.46s]  I got those.
[3974.46s -> 3976.46s]  I'll leave that.
[3976.46s -> 3978.46s]  Should I not touch it? What are you saying?
[3978.46s -> 3981.60s]  Oh, you're taking photos.
[3981.60s -> 3983.60s]  That's a good idea.
[3983.60s -> 3985.60s]  You took a picture.
[3985.60s -> 3987.60s]  JPEGs, whatever they are.
[3987.60s -> 3989.60s]  But,
[3989.60s -> 3991.84s]  I have something here
[3991.84s -> 3993.84s]  for you guys that's incredibly special.
[3993.84s -> 3996.27s]  We're going to move on
[3996.27s -> 3998.83s]  to something else. This is not a game.
[3998.83s -> 4000.83s]  Please, please give an incredibly
[4000.83s -> 4002.83s]  warm welcome
[4002.83s -> 4005.07s]  to the amusings
[4005.07s -> 4007.07s]  of Cuddles
[4007.07s -> 4014.24s]  and Pauly Polite!
[4014.24s -> 4016.86s]  Cuddles! Cuddles!
[4016.86s -> 4020.06s]  Cuddles!
[4020.06s -> 4022.06s]  Oh, yeah.
[4022.06s -> 4024.50s]  Sit down.
[4024.50s -> 4026.50s]  Sit down.
[4026.50s -> 4030.14s]  Sit down.
[4030.14s -> 4032.14s]  Sit down there.
[4032.14s -> 4037.17s]  I'm making balloons.
[4037.17s -> 4039.17s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4039.17s -> 4042.75s]  I want a dog.
[4042.75s -> 4044.75s]  Can I have a dog?
[4044.75s -> 4051.86s]  I can do that.
[4051.86s -> 4053.86s]  I make front legs and back legs.
[4057.76s -> 4060.45s]  Here we go.
[4065.30s -> 4067.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[4067.66s -> 4069.66s]  Whoa.
[4069.66s -> 4071.66s]  I'm going to fix it.
[4071.66s -> 4073.66s]  I can fix it. I can fix it.
[4073.66s -> 4075.66s]  I'm watching. I'm watching.
[4075.66s -> 4079.95s]  Boop.
[4079.95s -> 4081.95s]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[4081.95s -> 4088.14s]  Ah!
[4088.14s -> 4090.14s]  Oh, boy, yes.
[4090.14s -> 4092.14s]  I know what I want.
[4092.14s -> 4095.52s]  What? A dog.
[4095.52s -> 4097.52s]  We can make a dog, aren't we?
[4097.52s -> 4100.27s]  I want a dog.
[4100.27s -> 4102.27s]  Oh, my goodness. I'm coming undone.
[4102.27s -> 4104.27s]  Can I have a dog?
[4104.27s -> 4107.54s]  How about a dog?
[4107.54s -> 4109.54s]  A blue dog. A blue dog to go with my pink dog.
[4109.54s -> 4111.54s]  Okay. Hang on there.
[4111.54s -> 4113.54s]  Wooshy, wooshy, wooshy, wooshy!
[4113.54s -> 4115.54s]  Oh, I can do this really fast
[4115.54s -> 4117.54s]  because I'm good at this.
[4119.54s -> 4122.10s]  Yeah, uh-huh.
[4122.10s -> 4124.10s]  What's he doing?
[4124.10s -> 4130.42s]  He needs a friend.
[4130.42s -> 4132.42s]  He needs a friend.
[4132.42s -> 4134.42s]  Yeah, uh-huh. See?
[4134.42s -> 4142.34s]  I want a friend.
[4142.34s -> 4144.90s]  I forgot my nose.
[4144.90s -> 4146.90s]  I know what I want.
[4146.90s -> 4154.32s]  Oh, yeah.
[4154.32s -> 4156.82s]  Uh-oh, yeah, I can make a dog.
[4156.82s -> 4160.59s]  Yeah, I can.
[4160.59s -> 4163.41s]  You're all right.
[4163.41s -> 4166.66s]  What you doing?
[4166.66s -> 4168.66s]  Sit right on there.
[4168.66s -> 4173.76s]  I'll make a dog.
[4173.76s -> 4176.51s]  Woosh.
[4176.51s -> 4178.51s]  Let's try the other way.
[4178.51s -> 4180.51s]  Ooh, a purple one.
[4180.51s -> 4182.51s]  Yeah, I like purple.
[4182.51s -> 4184.51s]  Purple.
[4184.51s -> 4188.16s]  Yeah, I think they're really brittles.
[4188.16s -> 4193.46s]  Yeah.
[4193.46s -> 4195.95s]  See my nose?
[4216.37s -> 4218.37s]  Oh, yeah, you got a little wrong with that.
[4218.37s -> 4220.37s]  A purple dog cuddle.
[4220.37s -> 4223.82s]  I love the purple dog cuddles.
[4223.82s -> 4225.82s]  Yeah, yeah, what now?
[4225.82s -> 4228.83s]  I know what I want.
[4228.83s -> 4230.83s]  What?
[4230.83s -> 4237.66s]  I want a dog.
[4237.66s -> 4245.09s]  Please, can I have a dog, please?
[4245.09s -> 4247.09s]  Let me think.
[4247.09s -> 4249.09s]  That one.
[4249.09s -> 4252.03s]  That one.
[4252.03s -> 4254.03s]  That could be a weenie dog.
[4254.03s -> 4256.03s]  That could be a weenie dog.
[4256.03s -> 4258.03s]  He's a cute one.
[4258.03s -> 4264.94s]  That's a hound dog.
[4264.94s -> 4266.94s]  Maybe a Yorkie hound.
[4266.94s -> 4268.94s]  Yorkies are popular.
[4268.94s -> 4282.00s]  Stay right there.
[4282.00s -> 4296.27s]  Patiently.
[4296.27s -> 4298.96s]  You're not waiting patiently enough.
[4298.96s -> 4312.00s]  You're a big yellow.
[4312.00s -> 4315.07s]  Whoop, whoop, whoop.
[4315.07s -> 4317.07s]  That one almost fell away.
[4317.07s -> 4319.07s]  I know.
[4319.07s -> 4321.95s]  Whoa.
[4321.95s -> 4327.95s]  Whoa.
[4327.95s -> 4330.58s]  I'll hold it for you.
[4345.74s -> 4347.74s]  And dogs like me
[4347.74s -> 4375.38s]  can be
[4375.38s -> 4406.78s]  We'll see.
[4406.78s -> 4408.78s]  That is a leg, right?
[4408.78s -> 4417.62s]  Yes.
[4417.62s -> 4419.92s]  That's a leg.
[4419.92s -> 4424.46s]  I think he's pretty.
[4426.46s -> 4431.78s]  You want that one back?
[4431.78s -> 4434.34s]  Okay.
[4434.34s -> 4436.34s]  Can I have my yellow dog now?
[4436.34s -> 4439.15s]  Thank you very much.
[4439.15s -> 4441.15s]  My god.
[4441.15s -> 4445.68s]  You're not all done.
[4445.68s -> 4447.68s]  I'm going to take my dogs out.
[4447.68s -> 4449.68s]  Thank you, cuddles.
[4449.68s -> 4454.80s]  Bye.
[4454.80s -> 4458.06s]  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.
[4458.06s -> 4460.06s]  Yeah, okay. Bye.
[4462.06s -> 4471.07s]  Polly polite.
[4471.07s -> 4473.07s]  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful clowns.
[4473.07s -> 4475.07s]  We got them. Oh, you didn't think they were going to be
[4475.07s -> 4477.07s]  off course they were. You didn't think I was going to have something without clowns?
[4477.07s -> 4479.07s]  Are you out of your mind?
[4479.07s -> 4481.07s]  Anyways, this is it.
[4481.07s -> 4483.07s]  Right here behind me.
[4483.07s -> 4485.07s]  I know I've got my hair in front of my face.
[4485.07s -> 4487.44s]  This is a dunk tank.
[4487.44s -> 4489.62s]  So what's going to happen here
[4489.62s -> 4491.62s]  very important.
[4491.62s -> 4494.30s]  You have to shoot
[4494.30s -> 4496.30s]  this thing here while I'm
[4496.30s -> 4498.30s]  sitting up there.
[4498.30s -> 4500.30s]  And maybe you dunk me, maybe you dunk. I don't know. We'll see.
[4500.30s -> 4502.30s]  This is the idea that I had
[4502.30s -> 4504.99s]  two or three years ago.
[4504.99s -> 4506.99s]  And I'm ecstatic.
[4506.99s -> 4508.99s]  I'm so excited to get up there.
[4508.99s -> 4510.99s]  Because I
[4510.99s -> 4512.99s]  this is the main event here.
[4512.99s -> 4514.99s]  This is what I did this for.
[4514.99s -> 4516.99s]  And we've got a new robot in play here.
[4516.99s -> 4518.99s]  This is the pitching machine robot.
[4518.99s -> 4520.99s]  It is loaded.
[4520.99s -> 4523.42s]  It is dangerous.
[4523.42s -> 4525.42s]  Do not, under any circumstance
[4525.42s -> 4527.42s]  and I'm going to make this very clear.
[4527.42s -> 4529.42s]  Do not fire at me.
[4529.42s -> 4531.42s]  That's no, okay. Do not.
[4531.42s -> 4533.42s]  Not okay.
[4533.42s -> 4535.42s]  Do not fire at anything besides the
[4535.42s -> 4537.42s]  red circle over there on the right side.
[4537.42s -> 4539.42s]  Okay. You have my understanding?
[4539.42s -> 4541.42s]  Good. Great. Can't wait for you to break that rule in about
[4541.42s -> 4543.42s]  fifteen seconds. Anyways
[4543.42s -> 4545.60s]  I'm going to get up there.
[4545.60s -> 4547.60s]  Good luck. Because I don't think you got
[4547.60s -> 4549.60s]  what it takes. You bastards.
[4549.60s -> 4551.90s]  Was that good? Did I call them
[4551.90s -> 4553.90s]  bastards? Was that good? Okay.
[4553.90s -> 4574.88s]  So if you've ever been to
[4574.88s -> 4576.88s]  the carnival before
[4576.88s -> 4578.88s]  I'm not sure which camera I'm looking at here.
[4578.88s -> 4581.31s]  You got one chance
[4581.31s -> 4583.31s]  the same exact rules are in place.
[4583.31s -> 4585.31s]  Wait
[4585.31s -> 4587.31s]  for the timer
[4587.31s -> 4589.31s]  to get down to zero.
[4589.31s -> 4591.31s]  And then it's going to fire wherever it fires.
[4591.31s -> 4593.31s]  I'm actually a little bit nervous about this
[4593.31s -> 4595.31s]  because I'm excited. And yes I am wearing
[4595.31s -> 4597.31s]  jeans. That's to cover
[4597.31s -> 4599.31s]  an area that it may have been
[4599.31s -> 4601.31s]  that I don't want you to see.
[4601.31s -> 4603.31s]  You know what I'm saying? I got shorts on too.
[4603.31s -> 4605.31s]  So anybody that's typing OWO in chat right now
[4605.31s -> 4607.31s]  it's not going to work. Because
[4607.31s -> 4609.31s]  I've got like four pairs of underwear on
[4609.31s -> 4611.31s]  and now I'm going to leave it at that.
[4611.31s -> 4613.31s]  So
[4613.31s -> 4615.87s]  are we ready
[4615.87s -> 4617.87s]  to do this?
[4617.87s -> 4619.87s]  And mom if you're watching
[4619.87s -> 4621.87s]  mom. I know you thought I was
[4621.87s -> 4623.87s]  probably going to be a doctor but
[4623.87s -> 4626.50s]  not today.
[4626.50s -> 4630.02s]  Am I in the right spot?
[4630.02s -> 4632.02s]  I gotta make sure I'm sitting in the right place.
[4632.02s -> 4634.26s]  You have to do the wind.
[4634.26s -> 4636.26s]  You have to go for the wind too.
[4636.26s -> 4638.75s]  This is steel
[4638.75s -> 4640.75s]  by the way. I am protected completely.
[4640.75s -> 4642.75s]  No one
[4642.75s -> 4644.75s]  can get through much steel.
[4644.75s -> 4646.75s]  250 HP
[4646.75s -> 4648.75s]  per
[4648.75s -> 4650.75s]  softball that goes in.
[4650.75s -> 4652.75s]  25 HP reduction.
[4652.75s -> 4654.75s]  Gate. This is cold as shit.
[4654.75s -> 4656.75s]  Can I ask you a quick question?
[4656.75s -> 4658.75s]  Can I get a quick question into the crew?
[4658.75s -> 4660.75s]  Did anybody piss in here?
[4660.75s -> 4663.10s]  Nobody pissed in here, right?
[4663.10s -> 4665.79s]  You didn't piss in here, right?
[4665.79s -> 4668.29s]  Did you piss in here? You're nodding yes.
[4668.29s -> 4670.29s]  But I know you didn't.
[4670.29s -> 4672.29s]  Did somebody put ice cubes
[4672.29s -> 4674.29s]  in this too?
[4674.29s -> 4676.29s]  This is disgusting.
[4676.29s -> 4678.29s]  This is absolutely revolting.
[4678.29s -> 4680.98s]  I'm just
[4680.98s -> 4682.98s]  singing in the rain.
[4682.98s -> 4686.43s]  Ready to get dunked.
[4686.43s -> 4688.43s]  Those of you that don't think this is real,
[4688.43s -> 4694.13s]  there's real water in here. You can hear it swirling.
[4694.13s -> 4696.13s]  I don't want to pop this because it's going to make a loud noise.
[4699.58s -> 4701.58s]  This wind is scaring the shit out of me.
[4701.58s -> 4710.91s]  Best of luck.
[4710.91s -> 4712.91s]  Why am I nervous up here?
[4712.91s -> 4714.91s]  I should be completely
[4714.91s -> 4716.91s]  into this, but I'm just like, oh fuck, I have to get dunked.
[4716.91s -> 4719.22s]  That sucks.
[4719.22s -> 4721.22s]  That's not fun. I don't like that.
[4721.22s -> 4723.22s]  I don't want to go through with that.
[4723.22s -> 4725.22s]  And yes, I'm stalling.
[4725.22s -> 4727.22s]  That's what I'm doing right now. You figured it out.
[4727.22s -> 4729.22s]  The 15, 16,
[4729.22s -> 4731.22s]  20, whatever thousand people are here.
[4731.22s -> 4733.22s]  Yes, you figured it out.
[4733.22s -> 4735.58s]  Good for you. You want a balloon?
[4735.58s -> 4738.08s]  This is an elaborate
[4738.08s -> 4740.08s]  setup we got going on here.
[4740.08s -> 4746.80s]  Oh shit, okay.
[4746.80s -> 4750.00s]  I can hear it.
[4750.00s -> 4752.00s]  I can hear it now.
[4752.00s -> 4757.06s]  Where the fuck is it?
[4757.06s -> 4760.90s]  Where is it going?
[4760.90s -> 4762.90s]  You're aiming for there.
[4762.90s -> 4764.90s]  You're aiming at the
[4764.90s -> 4766.90s]  circle.
[4766.90s -> 4771.06s]  At the circle.
[4771.06s -> 4773.06s]  Oh, not even fucking close.
[4773.06s -> 4775.06s]  My voice cracked.
[4775.06s -> 4777.06s]  Don't delete that, rewind it and fucking remove it and edit it.
[4777.06s -> 4779.06s]  Not even close.
[4779.06s -> 4781.06s]  That was so awful like that.
[4781.06s -> 4783.06s]  What the hell are you aiming at here?
[4783.06s -> 4785.06s]  You're aiming out of a cereal box?
[4785.06s -> 4787.06s]  Guys,
[4787.06s -> 4789.06s]  you got one frog on a lily pad.
[4789.06s -> 4791.06s]  You think I'm supposed to be impressed by that?
[4791.06s -> 4793.06s]  No, I am dry as a
[4793.06s -> 4795.06s]  coat on a
[4795.06s -> 4797.06s]  rack, if that makes any sense.
[4797.06s -> 4799.06s]  Oh, hi there.
[4799.06s -> 4801.06s]  How are you? Yeah.
[4801.06s -> 4803.06s]  You gotta try it at least once, right?
[4803.06s -> 4805.68s]  They're going
[4805.68s -> 4807.68s]  for my head.
[4807.68s -> 4810.24s]  Can this go over?
[4810.24s -> 4812.24s]  Is this enough?
[4812.24s -> 4816.02s]  They're gonna be right in the face.
[4816.02s -> 4822.99s]  Same place, come on.
[4822.99s -> 4825.30s]  You're better than this.
[4825.30s -> 4827.30s]  You can do better than that, I know you can.
[4827.30s -> 4829.60s]  I'm actually concerned that
[4829.60s -> 4831.60s]  if you aim high enough, you're gonna be right in
[4831.60s -> 4833.60s]  fucking eyes.
[4833.60s -> 4838.21s]  I'm gonna have to duck.
[4838.21s -> 4840.21s]  This should be enough protection here.
[4840.21s -> 4844.50s]  Make sure I have the right plate.
[4844.50s -> 4848.14s]  Don't you fucking Jesus
[4848.14s -> 4853.39s]  Christ.
[4853.39s -> 4855.39s]  Oh my God.
[4855.39s -> 4857.39s]  You don't know how scary this is, okay?
[4857.39s -> 4859.39s]  This is a real machine.
[4859.39s -> 4861.89s]  They're trying to kill me.
[4861.89s -> 4866.62s]  I'm doing gamer neck.
[4866.62s -> 4875.38s]  You guys are so
[4875.38s -> 4877.38s]  bad. What are you
[4877.38s -> 4879.38s]  doing?
[4879.38s -> 4881.74s]  I'm going up there.
[4881.74s -> 4887.10s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[4887.10s -> 4889.66s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4889.66s -> 4891.66s]  Let me help you out here. Can I help you out here?
[4891.66s -> 4893.66s]  Let me give you guys a little bit of a hand,
[4893.66s -> 4908.13s]  because you guys are having way too much trouble.
[4908.13s -> 4910.13s]  Laptop, because I figured you guys were gonna have trouble with this shit.
[4910.13s -> 4912.13s]  This is a Dell Inspiron 4100.
[4912.13s -> 4914.62s]  This is, you don't know, this is the
[4914.62s -> 4916.62s]  computer that is all the way to the left
[4916.62s -> 4918.62s]  of Best Buy.
[4918.62s -> 4920.62s]  I almost fell in. This is my
[4920.62s -> 4922.62s]  brand new computer. Let me go and see if I can help you guys out here.
[4922.62s -> 4924.62s]  You guys are fucking
[4924.62s -> 4926.62s]  this whole thing up. What are the controls?
[4926.62s -> 4928.62s]  What are the controls?
[4928.62s -> 4930.62s]  W, A, S, D?
[4930.62s -> 4933.18s]  Let's see if I can help you.
[4933.18s -> 4935.18s]  I gotta log in though. Just give me a minute, I'm just gonna log in.
[4935.18s -> 4940.82s]  I don't know my password.
[4940.82s -> 4942.82s]  What the fuck is my password?
[4942.82s -> 4944.82s]  I have no idea what my Twitch password
[4944.82s -> 4946.82s]  is.
[4946.82s -> 4949.44s]  I think it's like Ballsack21.
[4951.94s -> 4953.94s]  Oh shit, I shouldn't have said that.
[4953.94s -> 4955.94s]  I lied!
[4955.94s -> 4960.03s]  Ballsack21 got me.
[4960.03s -> 4965.02s]  I gotta help you, because you guys are fucking
[4965.02s -> 4970.46s]  this whole thing up. Test here.
[4970.46s -> 4972.46s]  Let me do a test here, because this is...
[4972.46s -> 4974.46s]  See that?
[4974.46s -> 4978.11s]  You guys, you guys, let's go.
[4978.11s -> 4980.11s]  Let's do it.
[4980.11s -> 4982.11s]  Go down. Pull it down with me here.
[4982.11s -> 4986.14s]  Down, down here.
[4986.14s -> 4989.28s]  Yeah, looks like that makes sense.
[4989.28s -> 4991.28s]  A little further.
[4991.28s -> 4994.91s]  Come with me here.
[4994.91s -> 4996.91s]  No, go to the left.
[4996.91s -> 4998.91s]  Just listen to me, go to the left.
[4998.91s -> 5000.91s]  You know what, listen, you guys just don't get it.
[5000.91s -> 5008.64s]  That should be it, right?
[5008.64s -> 5012.42s]  I think I lied it up.
[5012.42s -> 5014.42s]  I should say fuck you streamer, that makes sense.
[5014.42s -> 5017.68s]  You guys know I love paying attention, you know, listen.
[5017.68s -> 5024.21s]  This thing, by the way, this thing
[5024.21s -> 5026.21s]  feels real new!
[5026.21s -> 5028.21s]  Can I just tell you? This is a new
[5028.21s -> 5030.21s]  laptop. Got it.
[5030.21s -> 5032.21s]  Left most spot at Best Buy. Make sure I
[5032.21s -> 5034.21s]  reiterate that. That's at least $215.
[5034.21s -> 5036.21s]  It's got a
[5036.21s -> 5038.21s]  Celeron. Intel Celeron
[5038.21s -> 5040.21s]  whatever
[5040.21s -> 5042.21s]  fucking denomination they have.
[5042.21s -> 5044.21s]  22? 2 GHz?
[5044.21s -> 5047.79s]  I don't know. How bad
[5047.79s -> 5049.79s]  would it be if for some
[5049.79s -> 5051.97s]  fucking reason
[5051.97s -> 5053.97s]  I was on the computer
[5053.97s -> 5055.97s]  and we were somehow
[5055.97s -> 5058.46s]  what an expensive piece of
[5058.46s -> 5060.46s]  technology the streamers use.
[5060.46s -> 5064.30s]  Let me help you get the dunk.
[5064.30s -> 5068.27s]  Oh, how bad would it be?
[5068.27s -> 5071.66s]  I don't know what it was.
[5071.66s -> 5073.66s]  I have no idea what it was.
[5073.66s -> 5078.85s]  I can't even.
[5078.85s -> 5081.15s]  Whoa!
[5081.15s -> 5083.15s]  You know what I love to do? I love to just like
[5083.15s -> 5085.15s]  toss stuff that's expensive.
[5085.15s -> 5087.15s]  I love to just go like this. Oh, that's fucking expensive shit.
[5087.15s -> 5089.39s]  No, I
[5089.39s -> 5091.39s]  didn't get this from, it's not a Vtech!
[5091.39s -> 5093.39s]  It's not a
[5093.39s -> 5097.94s]  Vtech. How long is that
[5097.94s -> 5099.94s]  joke gonna go on for? Let's find out.
[5099.94s -> 5102.24s]  What, 20 more seconds? 30 more seconds?
[5102.24s -> 5106.64s]  The fire, buddy.
[5106.64s -> 5108.82s]  Make it real easy for ya.
[5114.37s -> 5117.82s]  It's gone.
[5117.82s -> 5119.82s]  It's gone.
[5119.82s -> 5124.24s]  I can't even.
[5124.24s -> 5129.34s]  Well!
[5129.34s -> 5131.34s]  Ooh!
[5131.34s -> 5137.62s]  He's got some skills with that thing.
[5137.62s -> 5142.16s]  Let me get it on the computer.
[5142.16s -> 5144.16s]  Use mics!
[5144.16s -> 5146.16s]  Did I mention how expensive this laptop was?
[5146.16s -> 5148.16s]  Did I explain that?
[5148.16s -> 5158.08s]  Did I explain?
[5158.08s -> 5161.02s]  Ow!
[5161.02s -> 5163.02s]  Shit!
[5163.02s -> 5165.02s]  That got me.
[5165.02s -> 5167.02s]  That just got me, Odell.
[5167.02s -> 5169.02s]  Oh, it actually did.
[5169.02s -> 5171.02s]  Of all, honestly,
[5171.02s -> 5173.02s]  of all the fucking things that
[5173.02s -> 5175.02s]  injure me on this stream,
[5175.02s -> 5178.67s]  that actually
[5178.67s -> 5183.28s]  cut my hand.
[5183.28s -> 5185.28s]  Of all the things,
[5185.28s -> 5188.86s]  this like hurt me.
[5188.86s -> 5190.86s]  The tiny umbrella
[5190.86s -> 5192.86s]  is the thing that gives me like a welt on my hand.
[5197.60s -> 5199.60s]  Bring it back on the computer.
[5205.10s -> 5209.46s]  This has been tested, right?
[5209.46s -> 5211.46s]  I think so.
[5211.46s -> 5213.70s]  Down, bring it down,
[5213.70s -> 5215.70s]  bring it down.
[5215.70s -> 5226.88s]  Oh, god damn it. Oh, please.
[5226.88s -> 5228.88s]  You
[5228.88s -> 5230.88s]  killed the broadcast
[5230.88s -> 5236.83s]  and the stream.
[5236.83s -> 5238.83s]  They aimed at the gate.
[5238.83s -> 5240.83s]  That is not alright.
[5240.83s -> 5248.88s]  Get back up, I can't believe that little umbrella.
[5248.88s -> 5250.88s]  We have machines here
[5250.88s -> 5252.88s]  that are firing at me.
[5252.88s -> 5254.88s]  And I get my hand pinched
[5254.88s -> 5256.88s]  by a fucking baby umbrella.
[5256.88s -> 5258.88s]  That hurts me.
[5258.88s -> 5260.88s]  That's unbelievable. What a joke.
[5260.88s -> 5266.05s]  Get it!
[5266.05s -> 5268.05s]  Get it so I can put the laptop down.
[5268.05s -> 5275.54s]  Don't you understand the joke?
[5275.54s -> 5277.54s]  They're not going to get it. They're not going to get it.
[5277.54s -> 5279.97s]  It's too hard. It's too hard.
[5279.97s -> 5283.10s]  It's too hard. You're not going to get it.
[5283.10s -> 5290.78s]  You guys, you're not going to get it.
[5290.78s -> 5294.43s]  That was pretty close.
[5294.43s -> 5299.42s]  If this goes in, that's my whole
[5299.42s -> 5304.61s]  life liquid.
[5304.61s -> 5306.61s]  So anyways, you are not capable.
[5306.61s -> 5309.42s]  This is the easiest
[5309.42s -> 5311.42s]  game of the day.
[5311.42s -> 5313.42s]  I want to be very clear on that.
[5313.42s -> 5315.42s]  This is the easiest game of the whole day.
[5315.42s -> 5317.42s]  You did the frog launcher.
[5317.42s -> 5319.42s]  You can't do something as simple as hit the target.
[5319.42s -> 5324.93s]  Hey,
[5324.93s -> 5326.93s]  do I have nerd neck
[5326.93s -> 5328.93s]  to say yes or no?
[5328.93s -> 5332.51s]  Do I? Do I have a bad nerd neck right now?
[5332.51s -> 5334.51s]  Should I stand up? Should I stand up straight?
[5334.51s -> 5337.07s]  Okay, on a scale of one to ten, how bad
[5337.07s -> 5346.03s]  is my nerd neck?
[5346.03s -> 5349.42s]  I might as well just drop it.
[5349.42s -> 5351.42s]  They're not going to do it.
[5351.42s -> 5353.42s]  No, way too high, way too high.
[5353.42s -> 5355.42s]  You've got to go lower.
[5355.42s -> 5359.89s]  It's not going to fucking happen.
[5359.89s -> 5361.89s]  I am as safe as you could possibly be.
[5361.89s -> 5363.89s]  It's never going to happen.
[5363.89s -> 5365.89s]  You'll never dump me, you
[5365.89s -> 5368.13s]  fuckers.
[5368.13s -> 5370.13s]  Fuck all of you. It's not going to happen.
[5370.13s -> 5376.34s]  Oh no.
[5376.34s -> 5378.34s]  Oh no.
[5378.34s -> 5380.34s]  I can't believe it. Not my Dell Inspiron
[5380.34s -> 5385.01s]  100.
[5385.01s -> 5387.25s]  Oh shit.
[5387.25s -> 5389.25s]  Not my Dell Inspiron.
[5391.74s -> 5396.91s]  I said fuck you.
[5396.91s -> 5401.71s]  I said fuck you. That's what happened.
[5401.71s -> 5409.01s]  I didn't think they were going to do it.
[5409.01s -> 5414.13s]  I really didn't. I really didn't think they were going to do it.
[5414.13s -> 5416.56s]  Are we good?
[5416.56s -> 5429.42s]  I'm so embarrassed.
[5429.42s -> 5431.42s]  I can't believe. It didn't take
[5431.42s -> 5433.42s]  that long. It didn't take that long.
[5433.42s -> 5436.05s]  Nice job. I'll accept it.
[5436.05s -> 5438.80s]  What I really can't believe
[5438.80s -> 5440.80s]  is the fact that
[5440.80s -> 5442.80s]  I have an injury
[5442.80s -> 5445.42s]  from hiding it from you guys.
[5445.42s -> 5448.11s]  Stupid fucking umbrella.
[5448.11s -> 5450.11s]  I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
[5450.11s -> 5452.11s]  I was getting tiny umbrellas.
[5452.11s -> 5454.11s]  I literally pinched my fucking finger
[5454.11s -> 5456.11s]  and it hurts. I hurt myself.
[5456.11s -> 5458.74s]  All the fucking things.
[5458.74s -> 5460.74s]  How disappointing.
[5460.74s -> 5462.74s]  You could have taken my skull cap off of the ball.
[5462.74s -> 5464.74s]  No, I pinched my hand on a poly
[5464.74s -> 5466.74s]  fucking
[5466.74s -> 5471.28s]  whatever it is.
[5471.28s -> 5473.28s]  How fucked up is my hair?
[5473.28s -> 5475.28s]  I probably look so bad. This is like
[5475.28s -> 5477.28s]  real Jeremy. You know what I'm saying?
[5477.28s -> 5479.28s]  Jeremy Albertson is in front of you right now.
[5479.28s -> 5481.28s]  I can't pretend. I can't fucking. What are they saying?
[5481.28s -> 5483.28s]  I can see the chat, but I can't sit too far away.
[5483.28s -> 5485.28s]  Just yell out a fucking word.
[5485.28s -> 5487.28s]  Whatever they're saying.
[5487.28s -> 5489.65s]  You said balding.
[5491.65s -> 5493.65s]  You guys have hit my eye on you.
[5493.65s -> 5495.65s]  I hope you accept that. Any boogers coming out of my nose?
[5495.65s -> 5497.65s]  Just nod yes or no. Yeah? Are there?
[5497.65s -> 5499.65s]  That's great.
[5499.65s -> 5501.65s]  I thought it was going to take longer than that.
[5501.65s -> 5505.36s]  They're making it harder.
[5505.36s -> 5510.93s]  He's like
[5510.93s -> 5519.82s]  Just for the next few minutes, I'm just going to take a nap.
[5519.82s -> 5521.82s]  It's been a long fucking couple days.
[5525.28s -> 5527.28s]  Somebody grabbed his blanket
[5527.28s -> 5529.28s]  that's down there and I can't
[5529.28s -> 5531.28s]  reach it. He can't reach it!
[5531.28s -> 5533.28s]  I actually can't reach this blanket that's over there.
[5533.28s -> 5535.28s]  I'm going to go to bed
[5535.28s -> 5537.28s]  and good luck.
[5537.28s -> 5540.48s]  People that come to this stream that don't know what's going on
[5540.48s -> 5542.48s]  I can imagine if you see a guy
[5542.48s -> 5544.48s]  sleeping on stream
[5544.48s -> 5546.48s]  in a clown
[5546.48s -> 5548.48s]  like parade thing
[5548.48s -> 5550.48s]  with a donk tank underneath him, you're probably going to be like
[5550.48s -> 5552.48s]  this guy sucks.
[5554.48s -> 5556.48s]  No you won't. No you won't!
[5556.48s -> 5558.48s]  You're going to be like this guy's awesome!
[5558.48s -> 5560.48s]  And this stream has been awesome!
[5560.48s -> 5562.48s]  And it's been a fucking awesome day so far!
[5562.48s -> 5564.48s]  And we've got way more to do!
[5564.48s -> 5566.98s]  Can somebody get that blanket underneath me?
[5568.98s -> 5570.98s]  Let's go!
[5570.98s -> 5572.98s]  Get out of my face! You're fucking blocking the view!
[5578.74s -> 5588.46s]  This thing is so heavy!
[5590.46s -> 5592.46s]  What a bad idea!
[5592.46s -> 5594.46s]  Alright, I'm ready to go to bed! Let's go!
[5596.46s -> 5616.05s]  Don't do it again right off the bat!
[5616.05s -> 5618.05s]  Not immediately!
[5618.05s -> 5620.42s]  Can I get some resident sleepers in the chat please?
[5620.42s -> 5648.77s]  You guys are just so
[5648.77s -> 5650.77s]  bad at this!
[5650.77s -> 5652.77s]  I can fucking sleep!
[5658.72s -> 5663.38s]  Oh!
[5679.12s -> 5682.19s]  I can feel it every time!
[5682.19s -> 5685.58s]  It sucks!
[5685.58s -> 5687.58s]  This joke is funny
[5687.58s -> 5689.58s]  but I actually have to close my eyes and I don't like that.
[5689.58s -> 5691.58s]  I don't like closing my eyes
[5691.58s -> 5693.58s]  for this.
[5693.58s -> 5695.58s]  Does my hair look like a fucking rabbit animal?
[5695.58s -> 5701.39s]  It probably does.
[5701.39s -> 5703.39s]  Hey, remember how funny it was?
[5703.39s -> 5705.39s]  Remember how funny it was when you aimed at the cage?
[5705.39s -> 5707.39s]  We should do that like 5 or 6 more times.
[5712.30s -> 5718.32s]  Hey, remember how funny that was?
[5748.30s -> 5750.30s]  Hey, that was really funny!
[5750.30s -> 5752.30s]  That was incredibly funny.
[5752.30s -> 5763.18s]  Why is it a package in a package?
[5763.18s -> 5768.37s]  Get out of here!
[5768.37s -> 5787.25s]  Go over there!
[5787.25s -> 5793.95s]  My phone in my pocket?
[5793.95s -> 5797.15s]  I hope my phone is not
[5797.15s -> 5799.15s]  in my pocket.
[5799.15s -> 5801.15s]  That would not be very good at all.
[5801.15s -> 5804.93s]  Hey, don't worry over there,
[5804.93s -> 5808.90s]  sir. You got it once,
[5808.90s -> 5814.78s]  I don't think you'll get it again.
[5814.78s -> 5821.89s]  That's part of the act!
[5821.89s -> 5823.89s]  Hey, why don't I go back to bed?
[5823.89s -> 5828.37s]  Why would I smoke in bed?
[5835.86s -> 5837.86s]  I have to like swear at you more
[5837.86s -> 5839.86s]  because that's the only way you're going to do it.
[5839.86s -> 5841.86s]  What's wrong with you? A bug?
[5841.86s -> 5844.99s]  Alright, you guys.
[5844.99s -> 5850.24s]  You got it once.
[5850.24s -> 5852.24s]  I don't know if you'll get it again.
[5852.24s -> 5854.24s]  That was a fluke. It was just a fluke,
[5854.24s -> 5856.24s]  that's all it was. You broke my fucking computer too.
[5856.24s -> 5858.24s]  You know where I got that?
[5865.47s -> 5867.47s]  This thing weighs like fucking
[5867.47s -> 5869.47s]  100 pounds right now.
[5869.47s -> 5871.47s]  Do you like this? Do you want to see it
[5871.47s -> 5873.47s]  go under water? Well then play better.
[5873.47s -> 5875.47s]  It's not that hard. Play better, and you'll see
[5875.47s -> 5877.47s]  this go under water. How long do I have to do
[5877.47s -> 5879.47s]  the resident sleeper? I'm sleeping on stream joke.
[5879.47s -> 5881.47s]  Do better, play better.
[5881.47s -> 5883.47s]  That's the power of doing.
[5883.47s -> 5885.47s]  Home, whatever the
[5885.47s -> 5888.93s]  company is.
[5888.93s -> 5899.49s]  I don't need the cigar.
[5899.49s -> 5901.49s]  Get the fucking cigar away from me.
[5906.98s -> 5908.98s]  You're not going to do it. It's not going to happen.
[5912.94s -> 5917.17s]  You guys can't
[5917.17s -> 5919.17s]  do it twice. Did I think you'd be
[5919.17s -> 5921.17s]  able to do it two times? Absolutely not.
[5921.17s -> 5923.17s]  You only did it once accidentally.
[5923.17s -> 5925.92s]  Accidentally the first time.
[5925.92s -> 5927.92s]  No fucking way
[5927.92s -> 5931.57s]  you'll do it twice.
[5931.57s -> 5933.57s]  How many people are
[5933.57s -> 5935.57s]  watching right now? How many people are there?
[5935.57s -> 5937.57s]  With a count of how many people are watching?
[5939.87s -> 5941.87s]  Like 200 of you can't do this?
[5941.87s -> 5943.87s]  How many? 200?
[5943.87s -> 5945.87s]  I can't see the chat from here.
[5945.87s -> 5948.37s]  There's at least 125
[5948.37s -> 5950.37s]  people here. You guys can't figure this out?
[5950.37s -> 5953.50s]  Did it already? What do you want?
[5953.50s -> 5956.64s]  You guys, there's enough people
[5956.64s -> 5958.64s]  here to do this. And I'm shocked that you
[5958.64s -> 5960.64s]  can't do it. It's kind of
[5960.64s -> 5962.64s]  embarrassing at this point.
[5962.64s -> 5964.64s]  I had this joke where I was going to ball
[5964.64s -> 5966.64s]  in the dunk tank with a fucking pillow and blanket
[5966.64s -> 5968.64s]  and you're not even capable of doing that.
[5968.64s -> 5974.85s]  Don't show my feet. Don't show feet.
[5974.85s -> 5976.85s]  That's not good.
[5976.85s -> 5978.85s]  I don't want my feet on camera.
[5978.85s -> 5980.85s]  That's a thing.
[5980.85s -> 5982.85s]  Trust me when I say that. Don't show my feet on camera.
[5982.85s -> 5984.85s]  People will fucking scream about it.
[5984.85s -> 5986.85s]  Anyways, I mean seriously,
[5986.85s -> 5989.09s]  we're looking for
[5989.09s -> 5991.09s]  skill here.
[5991.09s -> 5993.09s]  I know you. I know you very well.
[5993.09s -> 5995.09s]  How bad's the hair?
[5995.09s -> 5997.09s]  Give me like a scale of 1 to 10.
[5997.09s -> 6000.03s]  Hey, whoa, I'm going to
[6000.03s -> 6002.03s]  bed on stream again.
[6002.03s -> 6008.05s]  Come on. Come on.
[6008.05s -> 6010.99s]  Do it. I'll catch it in the air.
[6030.62s -> 6032.62s]  You got lucky that first time.
[6032.62s -> 6034.62s]  I don't think it's going to happen again.
[6034.62s -> 6036.62s]  There's a smell emanating from this tank.
[6036.62s -> 6038.80s]  And it's
[6038.80s -> 6040.80s]  very much like, it's
[6040.80s -> 6042.80s]  an ammonia smell.
[6042.80s -> 6045.62s]  I didn't piss in it. I promise.
[6045.62s -> 6050.48s]  I'm going to keep doing this routine
[6050.48s -> 6052.48s]  until it works.
[6052.48s -> 6060.03s]  You're not going to get it. It's not going to happen.
[6060.03s -> 6064.88s]  I really don't think so.
[6064.88s -> 6067.38s]  Close. It's not going to work.
[6067.38s -> 6074.08s]  Oh, wow.
[6074.08s -> 6076.08s]  You can't hit a target that's sitting in the middle
[6076.08s -> 6078.08s]  of the canvas.
[6078.08s -> 6080.08s]  It's right there.
[6080.08s -> 6082.08s]  It's so easy. It's right
[6082.08s -> 6084.08s]  there. It doesn't move.
[6084.08s -> 6086.08s]  It doesn't go anywhere. It's right
[6086.08s -> 6088.08s]  fucking here. It's a circle.
[6088.08s -> 6090.08s]  You can't even hit a circle.
[6092.08s -> 6094.08s]  That's unbelievable.
[6094.08s -> 6096.08s]  I will
[6096.08s -> 6098.08s]  hold this against you
[6098.08s -> 6100.08s]  for the next ten fucking
[6100.08s -> 6102.08s]  years. You want to...
[6102.08s -> 6104.08s]  I almost fell off. I'm slipping.
[6106.08s -> 6110.30s]  I'm going to fall off.
[6110.30s -> 6113.31s]  You're not going to get it.
[6113.31s -> 6115.31s]  You guys...
[6123.76s -> 6125.76s]  It wasn't enough power.
[6125.76s -> 6129.14s]  No, no, no.
[6129.14s -> 6140.08s]  Wait, wait, wait. You got to get it
[6140.08s -> 6145.01s]  in the circle. That was me
[6145.01s -> 6147.01s]  falling, not you winning, by the way.
[6147.01s -> 6149.01s]  Because I'm wet and I'm
[6149.01s -> 6152.08s]  sliding off the seat.
[6152.08s -> 6154.32s]  I'm just doing
[6154.32s -> 6156.32s]  weightlifting.
[6158.32s -> 6161.26s]  Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[6161.26s -> 6165.42s]  You guys...
[6165.42s -> 6167.42s]  You guys suck.
[6167.42s -> 6173.38s]  I'll be real honest.
[6173.38s -> 6176.00s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6176.00s -> 6183.28s]  This thing is...
[6183.28s -> 6185.28s]  It's that way, blind streamer.
[6185.28s -> 6187.28s]  It's that way. Are you blind?
[6187.28s -> 6189.28s]  Are you guys blind?
[6189.28s -> 6191.28s]  Are you blind?
[6191.28s -> 6193.28s]  You're looking for that.
[6195.28s -> 6197.28s]  Can you see that?
[6197.28s -> 6199.28s]  Can they see the circle?
[6199.28s -> 6201.28s]  I just want to confirm they can see the circle.
[6201.28s -> 6203.28s]  Okay, they can.
[6203.28s -> 6209.30s]  Oh, right here. Come on.
[6209.30s -> 6211.30s]  Come on.
[6211.30s -> 6213.30s]  Oh, this is technically a circle
[6213.30s -> 6215.30s]  but not the right one.
[6215.30s -> 6217.30s]  Some of you wanted so badly to hit me in the face.
[6217.30s -> 6219.30s]  It's not going to happen. Good luck.
[6240.88s -> 6248.29s]  I'm real tired.
[6248.29s -> 6250.78s]  I just swallowed one of those.
[6250.78s -> 6252.78s]  And I'm not going to freak out about it because
[6252.78s -> 6256.18s]  it sort of slid down my throat.
[6256.18s -> 6259.18s]  This is not on screen.
[6259.18s -> 6261.18s]  I swallowed a lock that was this big.
[6263.18s -> 6265.18s]  You got two. Congratulations.
[6265.18s -> 6286.29s]  Fucking animals.
[6286.29s -> 6290.32s]  This is heavy.
[6290.32s -> 6292.32s]  Actually, it's pretty great that you can do it at all.
[6292.32s -> 6297.89s]  I got jeans on.
[6297.89s -> 6299.89s]  Don't fucking panic.
[6299.89s -> 6303.90s]  Is the GoPro in the right spot?
[6306.59s -> 6316.26s]  Only operate these things
[6316.26s -> 6318.26s]  if you're a professional, which I am.
[6318.26s -> 6329.06s]  Fucking laptop.
[6329.06s -> 6334.56s]  What happened?
[6334.56s -> 6341.47s]  What do you mean chat got me?
[6341.47s -> 6343.47s]  Chat got you?
[6343.47s -> 6345.47s]  How did chat get me? I don't understand.
[6345.47s -> 6351.73s]  Alright, so...
[6351.73s -> 6354.10s]  Are we doing another one?
[6354.10s -> 6356.27s]  Let's go. Line it up.
[6356.27s -> 6358.27s]  Come on. Give me everything you got.
[6358.27s -> 6360.90s]  No, no, no.
[6360.90s -> 6362.90s]  We're not pulling me again.
[6362.90s -> 6364.90s]  We're going to shoot the robot.
[6364.90s -> 6366.90s]  Chat has to shoot the robot at the circle.
[6366.90s -> 6368.90s]  Don't pull him again. I heard that over production.
[6368.90s -> 6370.90s]  I heard that over production.
[6370.90s -> 6372.90s]  They said pull him again.
[6372.90s -> 6374.90s]  I don't want to do that.
[6374.90s -> 6376.90s]  We're going to fire the bot.
[6376.90s -> 6380.99s]  Over here.
[6380.99s -> 6383.23s]  Pull him again.
[6383.23s -> 6386.24s]  No, don't pull him again.
[6386.24s -> 6391.04s]  There's much more today.
[6391.04s -> 6393.04s]  This is not it.
[6393.04s -> 6396.37s]  I'm happy that you can at least get me once.
[6396.37s -> 6398.37s]  The second time was bullshit.
[6398.37s -> 6402.14s]  Let's go.
[6402.14s -> 6405.54s]  I want you to give me everything you have.
[6405.54s -> 6407.54s]  Everything you have.
[6407.54s -> 6410.42s]  First try.
[6410.42s -> 6412.72s]  Get it first try.
[6412.72s -> 6414.72s]  Get it first try or I'm done.
[6414.72s -> 6417.41s]  First try or I'm done.
[6417.41s -> 6421.38s]  First try or I'm done.
[6421.38s -> 6423.38s]  I'll say it five times.
[6423.38s -> 6439.70s]  This is so wet.
[6439.70s -> 6441.70s]  It's so uncomfortable.
[6441.70s -> 6443.94s]  I'm just going to scream.
[6445.94s -> 6451.63s]  You guys don't got what it takes.
[6451.63s -> 6453.63s]  And that's fine.
[6453.63s -> 6455.63s]  You did get it.
[6455.63s -> 6457.63s]  You beat this more than any other game though.
[6457.63s -> 6459.63s]  That's good on you.
[6459.63s -> 6462.06s]  I'm going to scream the whole time.
[6462.06s -> 6464.06s]  Just be ready.
[6464.06s -> 6466.06s]  This mic is going to be loud.
[6466.06s -> 6470.53s]  I'm spelling.
[6470.53s -> 6473.02s]  No, that didn't work.
[6473.02s -> 6475.02s]  I thought it happened.
[6475.02s -> 6484.50s]  You know when you have like a flash
[6484.50s -> 6486.50s]  of something that's going on
[6486.50s -> 6488.50s]  and you kind of process it in your brain
[6488.50s -> 6490.50s]  you know what I'm talking about.
[6490.50s -> 6492.50s]  When you have a flash in your mind and you know what's happening
[6492.50s -> 6494.80s]  right this second.
[6494.80s -> 6496.80s]  That's like, what the fuck is happening right now?
[6496.80s -> 6499.36s]  Is this a dream?
[6499.36s -> 6501.54s]  Is this actually
[6501.54s -> 6505.31s]  happening?
[6505.31s -> 6507.49s]  I guess it is.
[6507.49s -> 6509.49s]  This was a dream that I had.
[6509.49s -> 6511.49s]  I didn't do a live stream.
[6511.49s -> 6513.49s]  So technically it is a dream.
[6513.49s -> 6515.49s]  You're coming up here and I'm wondering why.
[6515.49s -> 6517.49s]  So you have something to ask?
[6517.49s -> 6519.49s]  You? You have something to ask me?
[6519.49s -> 6522.11s]  What is it?
[6522.11s -> 6524.11s]  You're just coming up here.
[6524.11s -> 6526.11s]  You're just getting in my way for some reason.
[6526.11s -> 6528.61s]  Well, I can tell you a quick little story
[6528.61s -> 6530.61s]  while we try to have a little bit of a production
[6530.61s -> 6533.04s]  issue.
[6533.04s -> 6535.04s]  I don't have anything for you.
[6535.04s -> 6537.04s]  Literally there is like
[6537.04s -> 6539.04s]  I'm telling you don't do that.
[6539.04s -> 6541.04s]  I told you that like five times.
[6541.04s -> 6543.04s]  You should have listened to me the first time.
[6543.04s -> 6546.50s]  Get this guy out of here.
[6546.50s -> 6548.50s]  You understand like Twitch TV has
[6548.50s -> 6550.50s]  this thing where they fucking just
[6550.50s -> 6552.50s]  scream the word. It's an F word.
[6552.50s -> 6554.50s]  It's not F-U-C
[6554.50s -> 6556.50s]  No.
[6556.50s -> 6558.50s]  Get the fuck
[6558.50s -> 6560.50s]  I'm dead
[6562.50s -> 6569.15s]  That was intentional.
[6571.46s -> 6579.38s]  This is so disorienting.
[6579.38s -> 6589.73s]  I'll get like arrested.
[6589.73s -> 6592.10s]  So what do you think so far? You having fun?
[6592.10s -> 6594.10s]  We still got four more games to play and more.
[6594.10s -> 6596.10s]  By the way, I just want to make
[6596.10s -> 6598.10s]  it very clear. How fucking
[6598.10s -> 6600.10s]  incredible was
[6600.10s -> 6602.10s]  Cuddles
[6602.10s -> 6604.10s]  and Polite Bully.
[6604.10s -> 6606.10s]  That was unbelievable.
[6606.10s -> 6608.10s]  That's like the best show I think I've seen all year.
[6608.10s -> 6610.10s]  I saw Far From Home and that was a better
[6610.10s -> 6612.10s]  movie than Far From Home. I mean Far From Home
[6612.10s -> 6614.10s]  was a great movie though so I don't know.
[6614.10s -> 6616.10s]  Has there been any
[6616.10s -> 6618.10s]  Has there been any
[6618.10s -> 6620.59s]  No, not really.
[6620.59s -> 6622.59s]  But I think for time
[6622.59s -> 6624.59s]  purposes you guys have already
[6624.59s -> 6626.59s]  done it. And plus I think I'm
[6626.59s -> 6628.59s]  going to get like a disease if I stand here for like
[6628.59s -> 6630.59s]  more than another ten minutes. Like I really think that
[6630.59s -> 6632.59s]  there's like, look, just look at the water.
[6632.59s -> 6634.59s]  This is disgusting.
[6634.59s -> 6636.59s]  I have to like breathe this in. Do you understand
[6636.59s -> 6638.59s]  that this is like green at this point?
[6638.59s -> 6640.59s]  I have to get the fuck out of this.
[6640.59s -> 6642.59s]  I'm going to go take a shower and I'm going to
[6642.59s -> 6644.59s]  go dry off. We're going to move on.
[6644.59s -> 6646.59s]  And what is next?
[6646.59s -> 6648.59s]  We are going to something very important.
[6655.70s -> 6657.70s]  So when you go to a carnival there's very
[6657.70s -> 6659.70s]  some things you do at a carnival. What do you do at a carnival?
[6659.70s -> 6662.06s]  Let's see it in the chat. What do you do?
[6662.06s -> 6664.06s]  Just look I can see a stick. That's not what you do at a carnival.
[6664.06s -> 6666.06s]  I mean like funny but
[6666.06s -> 6668.06s]  you play games
[6668.06s -> 6670.30s]  you see clowns
[6670.30s -> 6677.28s]  and you ride rides. Enjoy
[6677.28s -> 6680.46s]  getting onto one of those rides at a carnival.
[6680.46s -> 6682.46s]  Have fun. I'll see you in a few moments.
[6682.46s -> 6686.43s]  Go ride the ride.
[6686.43s -> 6688.43s]  And don't show my fucking feet on camera.
[7050.83s -> 7052.83s]  Music playing
[7073.58s -> 7075.58s]  Music playing
[7075.58s -> 7077.58s]  Music playing
[7079.58s -> 7419.86s]  Music playing
[7442.56s -> 7445.25s]  Music playing
[7460.18s -> 7465.63s]  I'm the biggest fuckin' fucker you've ever seen in your life!
[7465.63s -> 7473.10s]  What the fuck can we own it for?
[7473.10s -> 7478.31s]  Go check it out! Have fun! Have fun in the filler segment!
[7478.31s -> 7482.31s]  Take a look outside your screen, I know you've seen Las Vegas, beautiful Las Vegas.
[7482.31s -> 7485.31s]  But, there's something else, there's other stuff here.
[7485.31s -> 7489.06s]  That was cool too, I don't know what that was.
[7489.06s -> 7494.03s]  Was that a, um, the sandcastle? Castle?
[7494.03s -> 7498.42s]  I can give you, I'll give you a reality of what happened here.
[7498.42s -> 7500.42s]  I can break it down for you real easy.
[7500.42s -> 7505.37s]  Uh, you broke it. You broke it. It's okay.
[7505.37s -> 7512.37s]  Too many people were typing at the same time, and you ripped the, uh, you ripped the belt off of the pitching machine.
[7512.37s -> 7516.45s]  So, good work.
[7516.45s -> 7519.45s]  So, uh, don't worry, it's gonna get fixed.
[7519.45s -> 7521.45s]  We're working on it right now.
[7521.45s -> 7524.45s]  There are many more things that are gonna happen here.
[7524.45s -> 7528.45s]  So, but you have, you have put too many inputs in,
[7528.45s -> 7531.45s]  and you've crushed the robot that was gonna be the pitching machine.
[7531.45s -> 7534.45s]  Well, but thank God we did the tongue-deck first, by the way.
[7534.45s -> 7536.45s]  Because that would have been bad if we didn't.
[7536.45s -> 7544.07s]  Uh, but yeah, we are almost at the, uh, point of the show where we're gonna do something else very special.
[7544.07s -> 7547.07s]  We're gonna, what do you think, we're gonna do something for you?
[7547.07s -> 7553.07s]  When you go to a carnival, you tend to, like I said, check out the rides, check out the, shut this fucking thing off.
[7553.07s -> 7556.07s]  I can hear it, and it's irritating me.
[7556.07s -> 7561.07s]  Uh, when you go to a carnival, you typically ride rides, like I just did.
[7561.07s -> 7565.07s]  When you go to the midway games, you lose over and over again.
[7565.07s -> 7569.50s]  But you also get this thing taken care of, if you know what I mean.
[7569.50s -> 7572.50s]  So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna paint a picture of you.
[7572.50s -> 7575.06s]  That's right, you.
[7575.06s -> 7578.06s]  You. I'm talking about you in the chat right now.
[7578.06s -> 7580.06s]  You're gonna get a painting of yourself.
[7580.06s -> 7582.06s]  Do what you want with it, but it's gonna take a while.
[7582.06s -> 7585.06s]  Because obviously the artist has to actually draw you.
[7585.06s -> 7587.06s]  So, they're gonna do that.
[7587.06s -> 7590.20s]  They'll take care of that.
[7590.20s -> 7592.20s]  I want you to sit down.
[7592.20s -> 7593.20s]  Have a seat over there.
[7593.20s -> 7595.63s]  And I know I said that a little weirdly.
[7595.63s -> 7597.63s]  I said that, like, as if you're in trouble.
[7597.63s -> 7598.63s]  You're not in trouble.
[7598.63s -> 7600.63s]  You're not, I promise you are not in trouble.
[7600.63s -> 7612.40s]  We are gonna go, again, to the amusings of, again, Cuddles and Polly Polite.
[7612.40s -> 7615.40s]  Uh, and they are gonna draw a picture of you.
[7615.40s -> 7626.22s]  Hey Pollyanna, you're supposed to wake up.
[7626.22s -> 7628.22s]  You've got work to do, you know that?
[7628.22s -> 7629.22s]  Oh, yes you do.
[7629.22s -> 7630.22s]  Oh my.
[7630.22s -> 7631.22s]  Yes you have.
[7631.22s -> 7633.29s]  Oh my.
[7633.29s -> 7634.29s]  Yeah, well you better not forget anymore.
[7634.29s -> 7637.29s]  Because you've got to pick out somebody and you've got to draw a picture of them.
[7637.29s -> 7640.29s]  There are one of the people in the home in the audience that are watching the show.
[7640.29s -> 7641.29s]  Oh.
[7641.29s -> 7642.29s]  Yeah, and you've got to do...
[7642.29s -> 7646.04s]  I know what I can do.
[7646.04s -> 7649.04s]  Well, you just wait a minute because I'm gonna give you your tickle feather.
[7649.04s -> 7651.04s]  Because that's gonna make it easier for you.
[7651.04s -> 7652.04s]  Yes, I am.
[7652.04s -> 7654.04s]  I'm gonna help you with the tickle feather.
[7654.04s -> 7656.04s]  Because then you'll be a real artist.
[7656.04s -> 7658.04s]  And yeah, that would be good.
[7658.04s -> 7660.04s]  And then you'll do a good job, okay?
[7660.04s -> 7662.04s]  Okay, let me see.
[7662.04s -> 7663.04s]  Oh, you're looking fine.
[7663.04s -> 7664.04s]  Oh, pretty dolly.
[7665.04s -> 7667.04s]  Yeah, you're looking good.
[7668.04s -> 7670.04s]  I'll see you later and don't go asleep.
[7670.04s -> 7671.04s]  Yeah, okay?
[7671.04s -> 7673.04s]  Stick off your sleepiness and draw a nice picture, will you?
[7673.04s -> 7674.04s]  I will.
[7674.04s -> 7675.04s]  They're waiting.
[7675.04s -> 7676.04s]  They're waiting.
[7676.04s -> 7677.04s]  All right.
[7677.04s -> 7678.04s]  Thank you so much, cuddles.
[7678.04s -> 7679.04s]  Bye-bye.
[7679.04s -> 7680.04s]  Bye.
[7692.27s -> 7694.27s]  She said I look nice.
[7697.54s -> 7699.54s]  Oh, I do look nice.
[7699.54s -> 7701.54s]  Oh, I look so nice.
[7701.54s -> 7704.80s]  Oh nice! I look like a real artist!
[7704.80s -> 7711.17s]  Yes, I do!
[7711.17s -> 7718.40s]  The kids must be trying to advise him.
[7718.40s -> 7727.32s]  Oh, they're too fuzzy! They're too fuzzy!
[7727.32s -> 7736.49s]  Oh! Oh, I can find somebody!
[7736.49s -> 7743.49s]  I can look, I can look deep into the homes of my viewers!
[7743.49s -> 7746.49s]  Oh, I gotta find someone! Oh!
[7746.49s -> 7760.19s]  Oh!
[7760.19s -> 7765.80s]  I found someone!
[7765.80s -> 7768.80s]  Oh! They'll do nicely!
[7768.80s -> 7773.80s]  Very, very cute!
[7773.80s -> 7781.37s]  What? No, I must pee!
[7781.37s -> 7783.37s]  Eenie meenie minie moe!
[7783.37s -> 7786.32s]  Eenie meenie minie moe!
[7786.32s -> 7791.28s]  What do I want to do? Okay.
[7791.28s -> 7800.76s]  Oh, he is!
[7800.76s -> 7815.27s]  Four minutes.
[7815.27s -> 7818.27s]  I'm so tired. I'm just so tired.
[7818.27s -> 7824.96s]  You wait till you see you!
[7824.96s -> 7835.69s]  You're doing such a good job and you're working so hard.
[7835.69s -> 7838.69s]  I thought I would give you a present.
[7838.69s -> 7839.69s]  I brought you something.
[7839.69s -> 7840.69s]  For me?
[7840.69s -> 7843.69s]  Maybe you're a little tired, yeah, because you haven't had a whole lot to eat today.
[7843.69s -> 7846.69s]  So I thought I'd give you a little something for you. Is that okay?
[7846.69s -> 7849.69s]  Oh, is that for me?
[7849.69s -> 7852.69s]  Oh, cuddles stink so very much!
[7852.69s -> 7854.69s]  Check it out! I know you're gonna like it!
[7854.69s -> 7856.69s]  I'm so hungry!
[7856.69s -> 7858.69s]  Oh, you'll like it!
[7858.69s -> 7860.69s]  Oh, boy!
[7860.69s -> 7864.69s]  Oh my God! We have a quarter pounder!
[7864.69s -> 7867.69s]  Oh, thank you so much!
[7867.69s -> 7869.69s]  Yeah, check it out!
[7869.69s -> 7871.69s]  Thank you so much! I'm so hungry!
[7871.69s -> 7872.69s]  I know!
[7872.69s -> 7875.69s]  I'm very, very hungry.
[7875.69s -> 7877.69s]  See? There it is!
[7877.69s -> 7880.69s]  Open it up! Yeah, that's a quarter pounder.
[7880.69s -> 7882.69s]  Okay!
[7882.69s -> 7885.06s]  That's a quarter pounder!
[7885.06s -> 7887.06s]  That's a quarter pounder!
[7887.06s -> 7890.77s]  That's a quarter pounder!
[7890.77s -> 7892.77s]  I got it, I got it, see?
[7892.77s -> 7897.38s]  Oh, well, cuddles, I need that!
[7897.38s -> 7900.20s]  Well, so what?
[7900.20s -> 7921.57s]  That's nice.
[7921.57s -> 7926.57s]  Beautifully beautiful. We'll see what they come up with at the end of the show.
[7926.57s -> 7928.57s]  Maybe they're painting you.
[7928.57s -> 7930.57s]  Well, they are painting you. Of course they are.
[7930.57s -> 7936.57s]  So what we have here is we have a series of images on the backdrop here.
[7936.57s -> 7938.88s]  You've played Down the Clown before.
[7938.88s -> 7942.44s]  You're about to play it on stream, motherfucker!
[7942.44s -> 7944.44s]  That was rude. That was really rude.
[7944.44s -> 7946.44s]  But you just dunked me in the tank and I just had to change.
[7946.44s -> 7948.44s]  I had to change my clothes, for God's sake!
[7948.44s -> 7951.12s]  That was rude. Was that too rude?
[7951.12s -> 7953.12s]  Should I have been a little bit nicer? Was that too rude?
[7953.12s -> 7955.12s]  Was that fine? Was that too rude? Okay.
[7955.12s -> 7957.12s]  I feel like I was a little rude.
[7957.12s -> 7960.12s]  So, you need to aim this machine.
[7960.12s -> 7963.12s]  It's the same machine that was at the dunk tank, by the way.
[7963.12s -> 7968.12s]  You need to aim this machine at the various images on the screen.
[7968.12s -> 7970.49s]  And there are quite a few, as you see.
[7970.49s -> 7973.56s]  Knock them down. Down the Clown.
[7973.56s -> 7974.56s]  You're in control.
[7974.56s -> 7976.80s]  The controls will be on the screen.
[7976.80s -> 7978.80s]  They're pretty similar to what they were at the dunk tank.
[7978.80s -> 7980.98s]  So, obviously, right?
[7980.98s -> 7984.28s]  We've got German Dupe 1, German Dupe 2.
[7984.28s -> 7986.28s]  Can we see some of the chat, please, by the way?
[7986.28s -> 7988.28s]  We are. We can see them.
[7988.28s -> 7990.28s]  I have to get out of the way.
[7990.28s -> 7994.28s]  Because I've been told that this will hit me from any point inside of the cube.
[7994.28s -> 7997.28s]  So, I kind of have to get the hell out of here.
[7997.28s -> 7999.28s]  Because you guys will seriously injure me.
[7999.28s -> 8003.28s]  And the only injury I've had all day was from the little umbrella.
[8003.28s -> 8005.28s]  This is true, by the way. All the production people.
[8005.28s -> 8008.28s]  I actually got injured by the little umbrella.
[8008.28s -> 8010.28s]  Like, seriously.
[8010.28s -> 8012.28s]  And we had to wrap it up.
[8012.28s -> 8014.28s]  There was blood everywhere back there.
[8014.28s -> 8016.28s]  But, do your worst.
[8016.28s -> 8017.28s]  Knock them all down.
[8017.28s -> 8019.28s]  Try to get as many as you can.
[8019.28s -> 8020.28s]  Good luck.
[8020.28s -> 8022.52s]  I will be commenting, and I can see the chat this time.
[8022.52s -> 8024.52s]  I don't trip over this.
[8024.52s -> 8027.11s]  Good luck.
[8027.11s -> 8029.11s]  Make it work.
[8029.11s -> 8034.50s]  Your inputs are disabled at the moment, but they will be active very soon.
[8034.50s -> 8041.35s]  Any food in this carnival? Yes, there is.
[8041.35s -> 8043.35s]  There is plenty of food.
[8043.35s -> 8055.08s]  What happened to audio?
[8055.08s -> 8057.08s]  I'm still here. I'm fine.
[8057.08s -> 8064.55s]  I just have to get away from the machine.
[8064.55s -> 8066.55s]  Wow, that was close.
[8066.55s -> 8069.79s]  That was close.
[8069.79s -> 8071.79s]  Right off the bat, almost right there.
[8071.79s -> 8073.79s]  Nice feet, man.
[8073.79s -> 8074.79s]  Give me a break.
[8074.79s -> 8082.25s]  We've got a guy here that wasn't aware of the feet thing.
[8082.25s -> 8084.25s]  Take down the Jupiter first.
[8084.25s -> 8086.43s]  There's no feet on camera.
[8086.43s -> 8088.43s]  There's no feet on camera.
[8088.43s -> 8089.43s]  Stop talking about feet.
[8089.43s -> 8095.38s]  There's no feet on camera.
[8095.38s -> 8097.38s]  Jerma Jupiter first.
[8097.38s -> 8103.97s]  Take it down.
[8103.97s -> 8107.71s]  It's clogged.
[8107.71s -> 8112.56s]  Oh, you got it.
[8112.56s -> 8114.56s]  Jerma Jup 4 has been knocked down.
[8114.56s -> 8115.56s]  Congratulations. Good job.
[8115.56s -> 8116.56s]  I did it.
[8116.56s -> 8117.56s]  No, you collectively did it.
[8117.56s -> 8122.29s]  Together you did.
[8122.29s -> 8123.29s]  Can you get them all?
[8123.29s -> 8126.56s]  Can you get all four?
[8126.56s -> 8127.56s]  No, that was me.
[8127.56s -> 8128.56s]  It was me.
[8128.56s -> 8130.37s]  It was all of you.
[8130.37s -> 8132.37s]  You all did it.
[8132.37s -> 8137.92s]  Can't you just give yourself some credit, all of you, together?
[8137.92s -> 8142.72s]  Let's go.
[8142.72s -> 8143.72s]  Go for Jerma Jupiter 1.
[8143.72s -> 8144.72s]  Jerma Jup 1.
[8144.72s -> 8145.72s]  Jerma Jup 1.
[8145.72s -> 8150.35s]  Jerma Jup 1.
[8150.35s -> 8151.35s]  Let's go.
[8151.35s -> 8154.97s]  By the way, these robots are all provided by AniMark.
[8154.97s -> 8156.97s]  That was a fucking terrible display.
[8156.97s -> 8159.15s]  Absolutely disgusting.
[8159.15s -> 8162.35s]  Were you guys even trying?
[8162.35s -> 8163.35s]  What the hell was that?
[8163.35s -> 8166.35s]  See, right now I get to be right over here.
[8166.35s -> 8167.35s]  I can see the cameras.
[8167.35s -> 8169.35s]  I can see the chat.
[8169.35s -> 8172.80s]  That was disgusting.
[8172.80s -> 8173.80s]  That was so bad.
[8173.80s -> 8174.80s]  Let's do better than that.
[8174.80s -> 8176.80s]  Like, seriously, I'm watching right now.
[8176.80s -> 8179.88s]  This is the first time I've been able to watch.
[8179.88s -> 8180.88s]  I suck.
[8180.88s -> 8181.88s]  You suck.
[8181.88s -> 8182.88s]  What are you talking about?
[8182.88s -> 8185.87s]  You guys saying I suck?
[8185.87s -> 8187.87s]  I have nothing to do with this.
[8187.87s -> 8189.87s]  I'm an observer of what you guys are doing.
[8189.87s -> 8192.30s]  I didn't do anything.
[8192.30s -> 8197.20s]  You have to control this.
[8197.20s -> 8198.20s]  Tilt up.
[8198.20s -> 8199.20s]  Tilt down.
[8199.20s -> 8200.20s]  Aim left.
[8200.20s -> 8201.20s]  Aim right.
[8201.20s -> 8203.85s]  W-A-S-D.
[8203.85s -> 8207.27s]  Get it.
[8207.27s -> 8209.40s]  Oh.
[8209.40s -> 8213.60s]  Oh, it went down.
[8213.60s -> 8215.60s]  It went down.
[8215.60s -> 8221.11s]  That technically counts.
[8221.11s -> 8230.13s]  That counts, I guess.
[8230.13s -> 8232.31s]  200 IQ chat.
[8232.31s -> 8233.31s]  Something like that.
[8233.31s -> 8241.84s]  By the way, if you get all four Jerma Jupiters down, I will dab in front of the camera.
[8241.84s -> 8244.84s]  I ain't doing it unless you get all four.
[8244.84s -> 8252.93s]  I will dab on camera if you get all four Jerma Jupiters.
[8252.93s -> 8255.30s]  How's that for incentive?
[8255.30s -> 8258.91s]  Come on.
[8258.91s -> 8259.91s]  Do it.
[8259.91s -> 8260.91s]  You want to dab?
[8260.91s -> 8264.77s]  No.
[8264.77s -> 8265.77s]  No.
[8265.77s -> 8266.77s]  You got it in the same spot.
[8266.77s -> 8270.10s]  Right in the same spot as before.
[8270.10s -> 8272.04s]  Come on.
[8272.04s -> 8274.63s]  Come on.
[8274.63s -> 8275.63s]  More to the left.
[8275.63s -> 8276.63s]  Pull it over.
[8276.63s -> 8281.28s]  A is left.
[8281.28s -> 8286.79s]  D is right.
[8286.79s -> 8287.79s]  You have to tilt it.
[8287.79s -> 8288.79s]  W is tilt up.
[8288.79s -> 8289.79s]  S is tilt down.
[8289.79s -> 8294.48s]  Play by the rules, god damn it, before I cancel it.
[8294.48s -> 8295.48s]  Where are you going?
[8295.48s -> 8297.74s]  Where are you going?
[8297.74s -> 8303.50s]  Where are you going with this?
[8303.50s -> 8304.50s]  There you go.
[8304.50s -> 8305.50s]  There you go.
[8305.50s -> 8306.50s]  Come on.
[8306.50s -> 8307.50s]  Do it.
[8307.50s -> 8308.50s]  Do it.
[8308.50s -> 8309.50s]  Do it.
[8309.50s -> 8310.50s]  Do it.
[8310.50s -> 8311.50s]  You got one second.
[8311.50s -> 8313.38s]  Oh.
[8313.38s -> 8314.38s]  Too far.
[8314.38s -> 8315.38s]  Too far.
[8315.38s -> 8316.38s]  Too far.
[8316.38s -> 8317.38s]  Let me get back there.
[8317.38s -> 8318.38s]  Let me coach you guys a little bit here.
[8318.38s -> 8321.38s]  I feel like if I was on camera and I was back there, aim at the streamer's face.
[8321.38s -> 8324.38s]  You know what I'm saying?
[8324.38s -> 8329.12s]  It's like, let's go.
[8329.12s -> 8330.12s]  Come on.
[8330.12s -> 8331.12s]  Right here.
[8331.12s -> 8335.55s]  The streamer is now ready to get hit in the face by a fucking ball.
[8335.55s -> 8337.55s]  You actually did it already.
[8337.55s -> 8339.55s]  I mean, surprising.
[8339.55s -> 8340.55s]  Yes.
[8340.55s -> 8342.55s]  Hit the streamer in the face.
[8342.55s -> 8343.55s]  Hit the streamer in the face.
[8343.55s -> 8344.55s]  You can do it.
[8344.55s -> 8345.55s]  I know you can.
[8345.55s -> 8347.55s]  I know you have it in you.
[8347.55s -> 8352.55s]  Once there's real danger involved, real danger, I could get hurt here.
[8352.55s -> 8353.55s]  Do it.
[8353.55s -> 8354.55s]  Right here.
[8354.55s -> 8355.55s]  Jerva Joop 3.
[8355.55s -> 8356.55s]  That's not in the right spot.
[8356.55s -> 8357.55s]  Turn it.
[8357.55s -> 8360.77s]  Turn.
[8360.77s -> 8361.77s]  Turn.
[8361.77s -> 8368.71s]  Turn.
[8368.71s -> 8369.71s]  Turn.
[8369.71s -> 8375.04s]  Turn.
[8375.04s -> 8376.35s]  Turn.
[8376.35s -> 8377.35s]  Get it.
[8377.35s -> 8378.35s]  You've got to go left.
[8378.35s -> 8379.78s]  Pull it this way.
[8379.78s -> 8380.78s]  Pull it this way.
[8380.78s -> 8382.02s]  I think the ball got stuck.
[8382.02s -> 8383.02s]  The ball was lodged.
[8383.02s -> 8387.71s]  You see, you guys are going, and I feel like somebody is spying on me.
[8387.71s -> 8388.71s]  It's you.
[8388.71s -> 8390.14s]  You're the spy.
[8390.14s -> 8391.14s]  It's always you.
[8391.14s -> 8393.14s]  You're coming and you're showing my feet and shit.
[8393.14s -> 8398.14s]  You know how long it's going to take to get over, it's going to take like three years for
[8398.14s -> 8402.79s]  this community to get over the fact that you show up my feet on camera.
[8402.79s -> 8409.37s]  You show up my feet on camera and all of a sudden, literally, I've got to shuck the balls
[8409.37s -> 8411.55s]  because we're running out.
[8411.55s -> 8418.88s]  It's going to take like two or three years because to get over that.
[8418.88s -> 8423.62s]  You know when you do something that you regret, that's one of those things.
[8423.62s -> 8426.62s]  I regret showing my feet on camera.
[8426.62s -> 8430.88s]  Can I ask you a question seriously?
[8430.88s -> 8433.88s]  I can't see the chat from here, but what the fuck is the feet thing?
[8433.88s -> 8434.88s]  What are you talking about?
[8434.88s -> 8436.25s]  It's just hands.
[8436.25s -> 8439.25s]  They're bigger and they're longer and they're on the bottom of your body.
[8439.25s -> 8440.25s]  Get over it.
[8440.25s -> 8443.41s]  Wait a minute.
[8443.41s -> 8445.41s]  Have you got it?
[8445.41s -> 8447.41s]  Are you going to get it?
[8447.41s -> 8450.89s]  Come on.
[8450.89s -> 8452.07s]  Come on.
[8452.07s -> 8454.40s]  Get it.
[8454.40s -> 8455.40s]  You got to get the full Jupiter.
[8455.40s -> 8457.40s]  It's not even worth it.
[8457.40s -> 8458.40s]  The whole Jupiter.
[8458.40s -> 8459.40s]  You can do it.
[8459.40s -> 8460.40s]  No.
[8460.40s -> 8461.40s]  More to the left.
[8461.40s -> 8464.24s]  More.
[8464.24s -> 8465.24s]  Too much.
[8465.24s -> 8466.24s]  Way too much.
[8466.24s -> 8472.48s]  Let me get some balls for you.
[8474.30s -> 8475.86s]  Guys, I know.
[8475.86s -> 8477.86s]  I mean, not here.
[8477.86s -> 8479.10s]  Here.
[8479.10s -> 8480.10s]  Here.
[8480.10s -> 8481.10s]  Here.
[8481.10s -> 8482.10s]  Can I demonstrate?
[8482.10s -> 8483.66s]  Can I demonstrate for them?
[8483.66s -> 8490.03s]  Guys, you're aiming so far to the other side.
[8490.03s -> 8491.03s]  Oh, sorry.
[8491.03s -> 8492.03s]  I'm going to knock you.
[8492.03s -> 8493.03s]  What are the others?
[8493.03s -> 8494.03s]  Any others?
[8494.03s -> 8495.03s]  Let me show you.
[8495.03s -> 8497.29s]  I'll show it to you.
[8497.29s -> 8499.29s]  You guys, you're going so far this way.
[8499.29s -> 8502.29s]  Collectively try to get it in the right spot.
[8502.29s -> 8503.29s]  Look.
[8503.29s -> 8506.07s]  Easy.
[8506.07s -> 8507.07s]  Go ahead.
[8509.78s -> 8513.32s]  Come on.
[8513.32s -> 8514.32s]  Hit the streamer in the face.
[8514.32s -> 8517.32s]  Remember what you did with the fucking frog game?
[8517.32s -> 8522.70s]  Wasn't that funny?
[8522.70s -> 8526.70s]  That's how we shuck balls to get them so we can continue to play the game.
[8526.70s -> 8528.13s]  Down.
[8528.13s -> 8530.13s]  Further down.
[8530.13s -> 8535.52s]  Get German Jupiter or I'll delete the emote.
[8535.52s -> 8537.52s]  You guys have like 10 minutes.
[8537.52s -> 8541.52s]  I will delete this emote if you do not knock it down.
[8541.52s -> 8543.02s]  You don't want that.
[8543.02s -> 8544.02s]  Nobody does.
[8544.02s -> 8550.51s]  The timer.
[8550.51s -> 8551.51s]  Get it.
[8551.51s -> 8557.59s]  Where the fuck are you going?
[8557.59s -> 8562.60s]  Where are you going?
[8562.60s -> 8564.91s]  I've got to have a talk with chat.
[8564.91s -> 8565.91s]  I'll be back.
[8565.91s -> 8566.91s]  I've got to go see the chat.
[8566.91s -> 8573.44s]  This is unbelievable.
[8573.44s -> 8576.57s]  I can see what you're saying.
[8576.57s -> 8577.57s]  Predicted aim.
[8577.57s -> 8579.57s]  I'm going to delete the emote.
[8579.57s -> 8581.26s]  It's hard.
[8581.26s -> 8586.01s]  We're trying.
[8586.01s -> 8587.01s]  I'm rubbing my hands.
[8587.01s -> 8588.01s]  Of course it's hard.
[8588.01s -> 8590.01s]  It's really hard.
[8590.01s -> 8592.25s]  Please, we need a crosshair.
[8592.25s -> 8593.25s]  We need a crosshair.
[8593.25s -> 8594.25s]  I'm just sitting here rubbing my hands.
[8594.25s -> 8597.25s]  This is exactly what I wanted.
[8597.25s -> 8599.25s]  Somebody give 10 community subs.
[8599.25s -> 8600.25s]  Holy shit.
[8600.25s -> 8601.25s]  Evil crucifix.
[8601.25s -> 8603.25s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[8603.25s -> 8606.20s]  Maybe you'll get it.
[8606.20s -> 8608.50s]  Chat needs food.
[8608.50s -> 8609.50s]  I ain't making any more food.
[8609.50s -> 8611.50s]  I almost hurt myself making cotton candy.
[8611.50s -> 8613.50s]  That's not a joke.
[8613.50s -> 8615.50s]  I truly almost hurt my hand.
[8615.50s -> 8617.50s]  That thing spins at like 400 miles per hour.
[8617.50s -> 8621.50s]  I didn't know that and I almost like fucking burnt my hand off.
[8621.50s -> 8624.51s]  Get it.
[8624.51s -> 8625.51s]  That was really close.
[8625.51s -> 8626.51s]  You had a chance.
[8626.51s -> 8633.10s]  We hunger.
[8633.10s -> 8637.86s]  Hold.
[8637.86s -> 8638.86s]  Shift it left.
[8638.86s -> 8639.86s]  I know.
[8639.86s -> 8642.06s]  That's what I'm saying.
[8642.06s -> 8645.06s]  Every time you go left and right, it's one step.
[8645.06s -> 8648.28s]  That's not bad.
[8648.28s -> 8649.28s]  That's not bad.
[8649.28s -> 8650.28s]  Bring it down.
[8650.28s -> 8651.28s]  Bring it down.
[8651.28s -> 8652.28s]  Bring it down.
[8652.28s -> 8655.44s]  Too high.
[8655.44s -> 8656.44s]  Too high.
[8656.44s -> 8657.44s]  Too high.
[8657.44s -> 8658.81s]  Too high.
[8658.81s -> 8667.28s]  Come on.
[8667.28s -> 8674.28s]  It's not.
[8674.28s -> 8675.28s]  What do you mean rigged?
[8675.28s -> 8677.28s]  How is it rigged?
[8677.28s -> 8678.46s]  You guys are in total control.
[8678.46s -> 8679.46s]  I'm not controlling this shit.
[8679.46s -> 8681.46s]  I'm all the way back here.
[8690.44s -> 8692.44s]  Look at where it is.
[8692.44s -> 8694.44s]  It's rigged.
[8694.44s -> 8696.44s]  It's only rigged if you think it is.
[8696.44s -> 8703.19s]  Let us hit you again.
[8703.19s -> 8704.19s]  I didn't let you hit me.
[8704.19s -> 8706.56s]  You actually did.
[8706.56s -> 8709.99s]  If you delete Jupiter, we'll do only feet clips.
[8709.99s -> 8710.99s]  I'm all right with that.
[8710.99s -> 8711.99s]  That's not bad.
[8711.99s -> 8712.99s]  To the right.
[8712.99s -> 8713.99s]  To the right.
[8713.99s -> 8715.48s]  Come on.
[8715.48s -> 8716.48s]  One second.
[8716.48s -> 8718.36s]  To the right.
[8718.36s -> 8719.36s]  Oh, come on.
[8719.36s -> 8722.36s]  You guys got one so quickly and then you've got two so quickly.
[8722.36s -> 8723.36s]  Come on.
[8723.36s -> 8725.36s]  You guys can do it.
[8725.36s -> 8730.57s]  Feed chat.
[8730.57s -> 8731.57s]  All right.
[8731.57s -> 8734.57s]  Somebody gave 50 community subs.
[8734.57s -> 8736.57s]  Holy shit.
[8736.57s -> 8740.07s]  AB Joe, you just gave 50 community subs.
[8740.07s -> 8741.07s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[8741.07s -> 8744.01s]  Thank you so much, AB Joe.
[8744.01s -> 8745.01s]  I might have missed a lot.
[8745.01s -> 8749.01s]  I've been up in tanks and over in the corner, but seriously, that's a lot of subs.
[8749.01s -> 8750.01s]  Thank you so much.
[8750.01s -> 8751.01s]  Really appreciate it.
[8751.01s -> 8754.57s]  You guys have to at least get some of these.
[8754.57s -> 8755.57s]  What about Jerma Payne?
[8755.57s -> 8758.67s]  Come on.
[8758.67s -> 8761.16s]  Work together.
[8761.16s -> 8764.40s]  You guys beat Dark Souls, for God's sakes.
[8764.40s -> 8766.73s]  No.
[8766.73s -> 8767.73s]  Almost there.
[8767.73s -> 8769.73s]  Close, but not really close enough.
[8769.73s -> 8775.36s]  What do you get for Jerma Payne?
[8775.36s -> 8778.18s]  What do you get for Jerma Payne?
[8778.18s -> 8784.18s]  Well, what will happen is if you get Jerma Payne or all four Jupiters, I'll dab on camera.
[8784.18s -> 8785.18s]  You're talking about those?
[8785.18s -> 8787.18s]  Because it's easy to get the top four.
[8787.18s -> 8789.18s]  Jerma Jup 1, Jerma Jup 2, Jerma Jup 3.
[8789.18s -> 8790.18s]  I can't even talk.
[8790.18s -> 8794.51s]  If you get Jerma Payne, I will dab on camera, I swear to God.
[8794.51s -> 8795.51s]  I promise.
[8795.51s -> 8799.58s]  I'm going to stand behind the net so I don't die.
[8799.58s -> 8801.58s]  Sounds like a good idea.
[8802.58s -> 8806.20s]  See, now I fucked it all up because everyone's going to freak out.
[8806.20s -> 8810.85s]  People are going to be like, well, now we have to do that.
[8810.85s -> 8813.41s]  I thought an incentive would help.
[8813.41s -> 8815.41s]  Oh, now you're going down there.
[8815.41s -> 8816.41s]  Good, good.
[8816.41s -> 8817.41s]  I'm going to get some balls here.
[8817.41s -> 8819.41s]  Let me help out here.
[8819.41s -> 8821.72s]  I've got to get a few balls.
[8821.72s -> 8824.28s]  I have faith that you guys might be...
[8824.28s -> 8825.28s]  I don't know.
[8825.28s -> 8826.28s]  Depends.
[8826.28s -> 8827.28s]  How bad do you want me to dab on camera?
[8827.28s -> 8832.65s]  This one is stuck there forever.
[8832.65s -> 8836.65s]  If you guys want me to dab on camera, you're going to have to get Jerma Payne or all four Jupiters.
[8836.65s -> 8837.83s]  That's the only fucking way.
[8837.83s -> 8840.83s]  That's happened in no chance any other way.
[8840.83s -> 8846.51s]  Let me try to get this one.
[8846.51s -> 8848.13s]  That's wedged.
[8848.13s -> 8850.13s]  That ain't coming up.
[8850.13s -> 8853.01s]  I hope I don't break this.
[8853.01s -> 8855.53s]  Get out of here.
[8855.53s -> 8861.65s]  I promise I'll do it right in the middle.
[8861.65s -> 8868.64s]  Remember, you can only do it when it's the green light.
[8868.64s -> 8874.68s]  If you are doing commands with a red light, it's not going to work.
[8874.68s -> 8878.60s]  Jerma Payne, there it is.
[8878.60s -> 8880.60s]  That's not even a real emote.
[8880.60s -> 8884.70s]  I put that up there for you guys.
[8884.70s -> 8887.84s]  That's a community place.
[8887.84s -> 8891.60s]  Oh, they're close.
[8891.60s -> 8893.60s]  Oh, you got to go up a little higher.
[8893.60s -> 8899.54s]  If you go up even 5%, 10%, I will literally dab on camera and do it.
[8899.54s -> 8903.48s]  We suck.
[8905.48s -> 8907.48s]  We suck.
[8912.31s -> 8916.66s]  No, you dunked me twice.
[8916.66s -> 8918.66s]  That's pretty damn good, I will say.
[8918.66s -> 8922.56s]  Get Jerma Payne.
[8922.56s -> 8923.56s]  Get it.
[8923.56s -> 8925.00s]  I know you can.
[8925.00s -> 8926.00s]  A little bit more to the left.
[8926.00s -> 8928.00s]  Maybe to the right.
[8928.00s -> 8933.14s]  Is that it?
[8933.14s -> 8934.83s]  No.
[8934.83s -> 8936.83s]  More.
[8936.83s -> 8942.68s]  You got to go more.
[8942.68s -> 8944.68s]  It's the wind.
[8944.68s -> 8948.84s]  The wind.
[8948.84s -> 8951.84s]  It's getting caught in the wind and flying forward.
[8951.84s -> 8952.84s]  There is a lot of wind.
[8952.84s -> 8954.84s]  You got to remember that.
[8954.84s -> 8956.84s]  More to the left.
[8956.84s -> 8961.64s]  That's too much.
[8961.64s -> 8964.71s]  Don't overcompensate.
[8964.71s -> 8965.71s]  That's not going to help.
[8965.71s -> 8967.84s]  That's not going to help.
[8967.84s -> 8972.09s]  That's not going to help.
[8972.09s -> 8973.09s]  I wonder.
[8973.09s -> 8974.09s]  That looks all right.
[8974.09s -> 8976.09s]  That's not bad.
[8976.09s -> 8979.29s]  That could be it.
[8979.29s -> 8980.29s]  Did they get it?
[8980.29s -> 8985.24s]  Oh, that was so close.
[8985.24s -> 8986.24s]  Don't move.
[8986.24s -> 8988.24s]  Nobody touch anything.
[8988.24s -> 8989.24s]  Do not move.
[8989.24s -> 8990.24s]  Just don't move.
[8990.24s -> 8991.24s]  Don't move.
[8991.24s -> 8992.24s]  Don't move.
[8992.24s -> 8993.24s]  Don't touch.
[8993.24s -> 8994.24s]  Nobody touch any buttons.
[8994.24s -> 8997.68s]  Just put, somebody press W once.
[8997.68s -> 9001.68s]  If someone presses W one time, it will stop.
[9001.68s -> 9002.68s]  Just W once.
[9002.68s -> 9003.68s]  Don't move.
[9003.68s -> 9005.11s]  Don't move.
[9005.11s -> 9006.11s]  No.
[9006.11s -> 9008.24s]  Stop it.
[9008.24s -> 9009.24s]  No.
[9009.24s -> 9012.40s]  Stop pressing S.
[9012.40s -> 9013.58s]  W.
[9013.58s -> 9014.58s]  It's going to go up.
[9014.58s -> 9018.06s]  Up.
[9018.06s -> 9019.06s]  Right, right, right.
[9019.06s -> 9020.06s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[9020.06s -> 9021.06s]  Don't.
[9021.06s -> 9022.06s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[9022.06s -> 9023.06s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[9023.06s -> 9024.06s]  Too much, too much, too much, too much.
[9024.06s -> 9025.06s]  That's too high.
[9025.06s -> 9026.06s]  That is too high.
[9026.06s -> 9027.88s]  Down, down, down, down, down.
[9027.88s -> 9028.88s]  Oh, God.
[9028.88s -> 9031.52s]  I love this.
[9031.52s -> 9036.73s]  This is fantastic.
[9036.73s -> 9037.73s]  I was wrong.
[9037.73s -> 9038.73s]  All right.
[9038.73s -> 9039.73s]  I'm not going to say anything.
[9039.73s -> 9040.73s]  You guys just do it.
[9040.73s -> 9047.51s]  I'm not going to say anything.
[9047.51s -> 9048.51s]  I won't.
[9048.51s -> 9049.51s]  I'm not going to talk.
[9049.51s -> 9050.51s]  I'm going to watch.
[9050.51s -> 9051.51s]  Okay, don't listen to me.
[9051.51s -> 9052.51s]  I'm wrong every time.
[9052.51s -> 9059.32s]  I'm coming over here.
[9059.32s -> 9060.32s]  I'm coming to you.
[9060.32s -> 9061.32s]  I'm coming around.
[9061.32s -> 9062.32s]  Is the wind causing problems?
[9062.32s -> 9071.96s]  We have to have people hold this.
[9071.96s -> 9076.31s]  That's pretty good.
[9076.31s -> 9079.02s]  Oh, man.
[9079.02s -> 9080.14s]  All right.
[9080.14s -> 9081.14s]  Listen.
[9081.14s -> 9082.38s]  Listen to me.
[9082.38s -> 9085.71s]  This is, bring it down once.
[9085.71s -> 9089.17s]  All the people that are fighting going up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down.
[9089.17s -> 9091.35s]  Just bring it down once.
[9091.35s -> 9094.23s]  You have to, people, there's gonna be overcompensation.
[9094.23s -> 9096.07s]  If you're gonna go down, somebody press up
[9096.07s -> 9097.99s]  because some people are spamming it.
[9097.99s -> 9101.75s]  Go, keep it there, bring it up, down a little bit.
[9101.75s -> 9105.61s]  That's all you gotta do.
[9105.61s -> 9107.94s]  Down a little bit.
[9107.94s -> 9112.38s]  You wanna dab on camera, that's how you're gonna get it.
[9112.38s -> 9117.38s]  That's the only way you're gonna get it.
[9117.38s -> 9120.30s]  You can see that like, which way do we go?
[9120.30s -> 9121.14s]  I think it's up.
[9123.54s -> 9124.70s]  I love it.
[9124.70s -> 9125.78s]  That's so funny.
[9125.78s -> 9128.04s]  Look at this wind.
[9128.08s -> 9131.34s]  What the fuck?
[9131.34s -> 9133.82s]  The wind just instantly stopped it.
[9133.82s -> 9135.74s]  That's so funny.
[9135.74s -> 9136.58s]  It's never gonna happen.
[9136.58s -> 9137.90s]  A good thing I don't have to ever dab.
[9137.90s -> 9139.14s]  That like hit the front.
[9143.13s -> 9148.13s]  It's crazy because you got this one in five seconds
[9148.57s -> 9151.13s]  and then none for like 20 straight minutes.
[9153.96s -> 9155.80s]  There's so much in-fighting, I love it.
[9155.80s -> 9158.48s]  I love it.
[9158.48s -> 9162.60s]  Get, oh no, you're changing tactics, I think.
[9162.60s -> 9164.00s]  Going up.
[9164.04s -> 9171.16s]  I don't know, going up it seems, maybe down.
[9171.16s -> 9179.52s]  You can do it.
[9179.52s -> 9185.04s]  Oh, up.
[9185.04s -> 9187.80s]  All right, hold on, let me get a few.
[9187.80s -> 9191.84s]  Let me get some, let me get some.
[9191.84s -> 9194.31s]  Can I get some balls?
[9194.31s -> 9201.22s]  Look, I'm the shucker, so.
[9201.22s -> 9204.02s]  You guys have to do this, I mean, come on.
[9204.02s -> 9208.61s]  We got all this stuff here, you're gonna get shown up.
[9208.61s -> 9210.05s]  Down the clown.
[9210.05s -> 9213.42s]  You guys can't do this.
[9213.42s -> 9215.18s]  This one is stuck here forever.
[9215.18s -> 9220.37s]  Hold on, let me get it out.
[9220.41s -> 9221.77s]  Yeah, let me throw a few.
[9223.19s -> 9224.88s]  Let me see.
[9224.88s -> 9227.44s]  I have to, look, I have to prove it's winnable.
[9227.44s -> 9230.24s]  With the wind, I know it's hard to prove, let me get two.
[9230.24s -> 9234.96s]  All right, the robot's right here, right?
[9234.96s -> 9243.66s]  It's a twister!
[9243.66s -> 9249.24s]  All right, I tried, I tried, let me, hold on.
[9249.24s -> 9256.24s]  If I can get one of these and just prove it, all right.
[9256.24s -> 9258.52s]  My own game doesn't work, it's rigged.
[9262.07s -> 9263.67s]  Surprise.
[9263.67s -> 9265.39s]  All right, I'll give you one.
[9270.63s -> 9284.56s]  Okay, I got you one.
[9284.56s -> 9287.24s]  It's rigged, it comes back up.
[9291.56s -> 9294.68s]  Here we go, here it comes.
[9294.68s -> 9298.12s]  It's actually rigged, well, that's what happens.
[9298.12s -> 9300.32s]  Let's go, accept it, let's do it.
[9313.45s -> 9316.73s]  10 seconds, come on guys, I know you can do it.
[9316.73s -> 9320.37s]  That's too low, you gotta pull it up a hair.
[9320.37s -> 9321.33s]  Pull it up a hair.
[9324.32s -> 9329.24s]  There, oh, oh, so close.
[9336.56s -> 9339.98s]  Reloading the robot.
[9339.98s -> 9344.64s]  All right, we're gonna give you guys two more attempts.
[9344.64s -> 9347.60s]  Two attempts, I know you can do it.
[9347.60s -> 9352.76s]  Do it, I know you can, please.
[9352.76s -> 9356.20s]  You've only got a hair, it's very possible.
[9356.20s -> 9359.94s]  I know it's completable, I know you've seen me do it.
[9359.94s -> 9365.38s]  From the same distance as the robot, come on.
[9365.42s -> 9368.68s]  You need to win the prize, which is a dab,
[9368.68s -> 9370.36s]  which I'm gonna regret for the rest of my life.
[9370.36s -> 9373.76s]  That's not a bad spot, not bad.
[9373.76s -> 9377.86s]  And that's pretty bad, and that's pretty bad.
[9377.86s -> 9387.28s]  We'll get one more shot, you got one more fire.
[9387.28s -> 9393.16s]  One more shot, you got one right off the bat.
[9401.47s -> 9404.83s]  You got one, and 25 minutes later, we can't get any others.
[9405.79s -> 9411.49s]  That's surprising.
[9411.49s -> 9418.19s]  Make this be the one, come on.
[9418.19s -> 9423.99s]  Do it, oh, oh my God, unbelievable.
[9426.84s -> 9428.80s]  I can't believe they actually did it.
[9428.80s -> 9433.28s]  That was your last shot, that was the final shot.
[9433.28s -> 9435.99s]  Oh, wait, that means, hold on.
[9435.99s -> 9440.75s]  That means I have to dab on camera.
[9440.75s -> 9442.32s]  Well, that's not good.
[9442.32s -> 9444.98s]  I fucking can't believe it.
[9444.98s -> 9449.29s]  It deserves some claps, it does.
[9449.29s -> 9453.86s]  Two of us will give you some round of applause for that one.
[9453.86s -> 9455.86s]  All right, time to dab, we're gonna move on.
[9455.90s -> 9460.00s]  You did it, I actually can't believe it.
[9460.00s -> 9466.99s]  Oh, I have to dab on camera.
[9466.99s -> 9469.52s]  Which camera am I on?
[9469.52s -> 9471.96s]  Can I just pretend to do it?
[9471.96s -> 9474.32s]  Do I have to actually do a full dab on camera?
[9475.36s -> 9486.12s]  I have to?
[9486.12s -> 9486.96s]  Why did I say that?
[9486.96s -> 9489.24s]  I should've just said you have to get all four.
[9489.24s -> 9491.24s]  My own worst enemy here.
[9491.24s -> 9494.93s]  So which way, which way, left or right?
[9494.93s -> 9495.77s]  That way, okay.
[9501.69s -> 9503.89s]  34 years old, by the way, tomorrow,
[9503.89s -> 9505.41s]  in case anyone's curious.
[9505.41s -> 9507.25s]  That's not a lie, that's real.
[9507.65s -> 9508.49s]  Oh, that hurt.
[9513.66s -> 9516.14s]  You can tell how many times I've done that
[9516.14s -> 9521.54s]  by me hurting myself on a dab.
[9521.54s -> 9525.11s]  Okay, so we're gonna move on, thank you.
[9525.11s -> 9528.75s]  I'm like afraid this is gonna shoot me in the chest.
[9528.75s -> 9531.64s]  Imagine that, it was just like, ugh.
[9531.64s -> 9534.24s]  We actually had a joke that we were gonna do,
[9534.24s -> 9536.52s]  but we couldn't, because it was too dangerous.
[9536.52s -> 9540.56s]  We were gonna load in a little dummy ball,
[9540.56s -> 9542.20s]  a little like foam ball,
[9542.20s -> 9543.52s]  and they were gonna shoot me right in the chest
[9543.52s -> 9544.60s]  with it right in the beginning.
[9544.64s -> 9546.04s]  I was like, oh yeah, I'm introducing the games,
[9546.04s -> 9548.44s]  and I get hit right in the chest by a fucking ball.
[9548.44s -> 9550.32s]  But there was just the legal shit,
[9550.32s -> 9551.96s]  it was just that we couldn't do it.
[9551.96s -> 9553.64s]  We could not do that.
[9553.64s -> 9556.40s]  Because if there was a chance that a regular softball
[9556.40s -> 9557.96s]  got in there and I would get hit in the chest,
[9557.96s -> 9559.56s]  it would be like Happy Gilmore.
[9560.88s -> 9563.00s]  That's not all right, that's not okay.
[9563.00s -> 9565.48s]  And medical staff speaking,
[9567.84s -> 9569.12s]  we've got plenty of people that are over there
[9569.12s -> 9572.76s]  that are ready to wait in case I get hurt by an umbrella.
[9572.76s -> 9575.44s]  But medically speaking, we didn't have the staff.
[9575.84s -> 9577.16s]  To be prepared for me to get hit in the face
[9577.16s -> 9578.12s]  by a real softball.
[9578.12s -> 9580.28s]  So, we didn't do it.
[9580.28s -> 9584.28s]  But we are at the point in the show where,
[9584.28s -> 9585.36s]  and I know there's gonna be a lot,
[9585.36s -> 9586.20s]  you know what, I can already see it.
[9586.20s -> 9588.04s]  This is like, there's already 100 images.
[9588.04s -> 9589.08s]  I can see them on the subreddit.
[9589.08s -> 9590.12s]  And that's at the German N95.
[9590.12s -> 9592.88s]  So by the way, it's still September.
[9595.25s -> 9596.57s]  What day is it?
[9596.57s -> 9597.69s]  Is it 22nd?
[9597.69s -> 9599.09s]  When does September stop?
[9599.09s -> 9601.45s]  21st.
[9601.45s -> 9603.97s]  Okay, so September stops at the end of September.
[9603.97s -> 9605.97s]  If you feel like subscribing to the channel,
[9605.97s -> 9606.81s]  then don't, don't.
[9606.81s -> 9607.65s]  It's not worth it.
[9607.65s -> 9608.49s]  This channel sucks.
[9610.34s -> 9611.22s]  You're better off fucking buying
[9611.22s -> 9612.50s]  like a pack of bubblegum or something,
[9612.50s -> 9613.94s]  but just don't either.
[9613.94s -> 9616.90s]  Anyways, we have way more to do.
[9617.94s -> 9619.54s]  Let's talk about these.
[9619.54s -> 9622.85s]  So over the course of the stream,
[9622.85s -> 9625.25s]  how did I hurt myself again
[9625.25s -> 9628.57s]  with this little shit I don't understand?
[9628.57s -> 9630.17s]  I'm hurt.
[9630.17s -> 9632.01s]  I actually hurt myself again.
[9632.01s -> 9634.13s]  How the fuck is this possible?
[9634.13s -> 9636.85s]  The tiny umbrella, the paper.
[9636.89s -> 9640.08s]  I just paper cut my hand.
[9640.08s -> 9641.64s]  I just wipe it up my ass.
[9641.64s -> 9644.24s]  On my ass, not up, you know, you get it.
[9644.24s -> 9646.20s]  We have been tracking how many bits have come in
[9646.20s -> 9648.32s]  through the course of the stream.
[9648.32s -> 9652.70s]  And over the course of the stream,
[9652.70s -> 9655.86s]  there has been quite a few bits that have come in.
[9655.86s -> 9657.14s]  So what we're going to do
[9658.02s -> 9661.70s]  is I'm gonna try to collect as many as I possibly can.
[9661.70s -> 9664.38s]  And we're gonna do that with a very, very important task
[9664.38s -> 9666.38s]  that I will have to do
[9666.38s -> 9670.81s]  and any bits that I do not collect through this machine,
[9670.81s -> 9671.77s]  we're going right to charity.
[9671.77s -> 9673.33s]  You heard it here first.
[9673.33s -> 9678.33s]  So why don't we, you can take this from me.
[9678.57s -> 9685.08s]  Why don't we cut to the money machine?
[9685.08s -> 9687.36s]  And welcome by the German 95 arcade.
[9688.20s -> 9689.36s]  This is the arcade.
[9689.36s -> 9691.32s]  We have some cool stuff here.
[9691.32s -> 9694.12s]  Got an authentic Pac-Man stand-up cabinet,
[9694.12s -> 9696.32s]  which is, you know, that was,
[9696.32s -> 9698.36s]  you can get it at Walmart, it's not that much.
[9698.36s -> 9701.12s]  Money machine, I have to collect as much of this as I can
[9701.12s -> 9704.20s]  otherwise it's going right to charity, you understand?
[9704.20s -> 9707.24s]  We also have, I forget about that, that's not real.
[9707.24s -> 9710.04s]  I am going to get eye protection first
[9712.09s -> 9713.97s]  because if one of them's right there,
[9713.97s -> 9715.53s]  you know what I'm saying?
[9715.53s -> 9717.41s]  Let's see how much of this I can actually get.
[9717.41s -> 9719.97s]  By the way, thank you to anybody that has given any bits
[9719.97s -> 9720.89s]  during the stream.
[9723.03s -> 9726.79s]  I am ready to collect as much as I can.
[9726.79s -> 9728.67s]  And what have we got here?
[9728.67s -> 9731.34s]  Somebody gave two, wait, there was, wait, there was a,
[9732.26s -> 9736.38s]  there was $200 donation, a bit donation?
[9736.38s -> 9739.46s]  Two fifties, a 10?
[9739.46s -> 9741.64s]  All right, so we've got a lot of money here.
[9741.64s -> 9744.64s]  And there was a lot of money that was given so far.
[9744.64s -> 9745.84s]  It's all in here already.
[9745.84s -> 9748.52s]  And just total transparency.
[9748.52s -> 9749.96s]  There it goes, it's in there.
[9749.96s -> 9751.84s]  I cannot see it.
[9751.84s -> 9755.70s]  I can't touch it until, of course, this is closed,
[9755.70s -> 9758.30s]  which, and then I got 60 seconds to figure it out.
[9763.70s -> 9765.86s]  Let's see how much I can get from me,
[9765.86s -> 9767.46s]  how much money I can collect.
[9770.07s -> 9772.11s]  Are we ready to turn this fucking thing on
[9772.11s -> 9774.87s]  so I can embarrass myself in front of my parents some more?
[9774.87s -> 9776.19s]  Because I heard they were watching.
[9776.19s -> 9779.87s]  Mom, I'll take you out to dinner tomorrow night.
[9779.87s -> 9782.41s]  Probably like next week.
[9782.41s -> 9791.44s]  I'm ready, begin!
[9791.44s -> 9796.72s]  I got a dollar, I got one cent!
[9796.72s -> 9799.92s]  I got a dollar, I got one dollar, two dollars!
[9799.92s -> 9800.76s]  I got a 10!
[9802.22s -> 9808.25s]  Always going to the corner.
[9808.25s -> 9812.09s]  I'm just gonna try to scoot.
[9812.09s -> 9813.33s]  Where's the 100?
[9813.33s -> 9815.82s]  Where's the 100?
[9815.98s -> 9820.57s]  I need that 100.
[9820.57s -> 9823.82s]  I got a 100!
[9823.82s -> 9829.01s]  No, don't put it in your pants, that's bad.
[9829.01s -> 9837.28s]  It's way harder than it looks.
[9837.28s -> 9840.69s]  I can't see!
[9840.69s -> 9848.12s]  They're all wedged in here!
[9848.12s -> 9849.40s]  Is that it?
[9849.40s -> 9853.12s]  That's it?
[9853.12s -> 9856.72s]  So, that's it, okay.
[9856.72s -> 9858.00s]  That counts, that counts, that counts, that counts.
[9858.00s -> 9859.80s]  This one counts.
[9859.80s -> 9861.82s]  So what'd I get?
[9861.82s -> 9866.91s]  A dollar.
[9866.91s -> 9868.15s]  Did I lose the 100?
[9868.15s -> 9871.40s]  I have one cent.
[9871.40s -> 9873.60s]  One, okay, a dollar and one cent.
[9873.60s -> 9875.48s]  Can we keep track of these so long?
[9875.48s -> 9876.60s]  Okay, all right, that's gone.
[9876.60s -> 9879.06s]  A dollar and one cent?
[9879.82s -> 9882.40s]  So that's $11 and one cent.
[9882.40s -> 9884.00s]  $11 and two cents.
[9887.21s -> 9892.48s]  $12 and two cents.
[9892.48s -> 9895.63s]  $13 and two cents.
[9895.63s -> 9897.27s]  $13 and two cents.
[9897.27s -> 9902.16s]  $14 and three cents.
[9902.16s -> 9907.27s]  $15 and three cents is a big one.
[9907.27s -> 9910.84s]  That's $24 and three cents.
[9910.84s -> 9914.00s]  Oh, you didn't think I got a fucking big one?
[9914.00s -> 9918.33s]  That's $73 and three cents.
[9918.37s -> 9921.40s]  $84 and three cents.
[9921.40s -> 9924.56s]  $84 and four cents.
[9924.56s -> 9927.76s]  There you go, that's what I get to keep.
[9927.76s -> 9929.69s]  You want me to go again?
[9929.69s -> 9930.93s]  I get to get more money?
[9930.93s -> 9933.52s]  All right, let's do it again.
[9933.52s -> 9935.26s]  Did more come in?
[9935.26s -> 9939.53s]  Oh, more money came in.
[9939.53s -> 9941.41s]  More money came in.
[9941.41s -> 9942.25s]  Fucking thing up again.
[9942.25s -> 9946.90s]  Let's see if I can get out of here with the fakers.
[9946.90s -> 9948.10s]  By the way, this doesn't work.
[9948.10s -> 9950.04s]  Let's sit here for show.
[9950.04s -> 9952.20s]  I'm sorry, I had to put something here.
[9959.52s -> 9960.36s]  How much was that?
[9960.36s -> 9961.20s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[9961.20s -> 9962.68s]  Did you just put in like nine cents?
[9962.68s -> 9963.52s]  It was like, yeah.
[9966.23s -> 9976.08s]  So if we're going again for nine cents.
[9976.08s -> 9976.92s]  Here we go.
[9976.92s -> 9980.73s]  You want to lock it?
[9980.73s -> 9982.45s]  I'm ready.
[9982.45s -> 9984.35s]  I'm looking for that hundred.
[9984.35s -> 9987.28s]  I'm only going for hundreds.
[9987.28s -> 9988.76s]  What if I just pick them up now?
[9988.76s -> 9990.23s]  Is that legal?
[9990.23s -> 9991.07s]  No?
[9991.07s -> 9995.80s]  Okay, can I?
[9995.80s -> 9996.64s]  Got it.
[9996.64s -> 10002.00s]  $200, $220,000 bits.
[10002.00s -> 10003.80s]  20,000 of them.
[10027.20s -> 10057.35s]  I got enough tactics.
[10057.35s -> 10058.79s]  Oh my God.
[10058.79s -> 10069.08s]  Okay, I need help.
[10071.08s -> 10072.66s]  You don't help me?
[10072.66s -> 10074.30s]  Son, you need to get out of here.
[10074.30s -> 10080.33s]  That one counts.
[10080.33s -> 10086.29s]  Hey, I need somebody to take these.
[10086.29s -> 10091.63s]  I did it.
[10091.63s -> 10106.25s]  10, $10 and one cent, $12 and one cent.
[10106.25s -> 10108.05s]  I need somebody to count.
[10108.05s -> 10110.03s]  What is it?
[10110.03s -> 10112.55s]  $12 and two cents.
[10112.55s -> 10114.55s]  Oh my God, $12 and three cents.
[10118.80s -> 10120.44s]  $12 and four cents.
[10124.65s -> 10130.42s]  That can't be it.
[10130.42s -> 10134.60s]  $12 and five cents.
[10134.72s -> 10136.88s]  That tactic was not good, apparently.
[10137.80s -> 10141.01s]  How did I not end up with a hundred?
[10141.01s -> 10142.49s]  I was like doing the vacuum.
[10145.88s -> 10149.54s]  This is gonna, hold on.
[10149.54s -> 10150.78s]  No, there's nothing else in here.
[10150.78s -> 10154.29s]  That was it.
[10154.29s -> 10155.49s]  Okay.
[10155.49s -> 10160.62s]  Well, that's going to charity.
[10160.62s -> 10162.30s]  We are gonna move on to the next game.
[10162.30s -> 10164.26s]  And why am I, I don't need to still wear these.
[10164.26s -> 10165.10s]  We're going on to the next game.
[10165.10s -> 10169.74s]  The next game is going to be the cheese game.
[10169.74s -> 10171.86s]  Get the fucking ball with the cheese.
[10171.86s -> 10173.99s]  See you over there.
[10173.99s -> 10197.91s]  Let's go.
[10197.91s -> 10200.39s]  This is back in the launcher machine.
[10200.39s -> 10203.19s]  We are going to do, get the ball and the cheese,
[10203.19s -> 10204.31s]  switch cheese game.
[10206.11s -> 10208.27s]  I feel like you guys can do this one pretty well.
[10208.27s -> 10213.27s]  Because if you take a good look, you will see we have,
[10214.71s -> 10218.51s]  there's a lot of holes, but we do have one, two, three,
[10218.51s -> 10222.99s]  four, five, six green holes and some wiffle balls.
[10223.03s -> 10227.87s]  You have to get the wiffle balls into the green holes.
[10227.87s -> 10229.47s]  That's the only way it counts.
[10229.47s -> 10230.71s]  Nothing else counts.
[10231.67s -> 10236.21s]  You have the launcher at your disposal, make it work.
[10236.21s -> 10237.33s]  You'll be launching wiffle balls.
[10237.33s -> 10240.05s]  Let's go ahead and show how it works.
[10240.05s -> 10245.99s]  As you see, we got to take a look from here.
[10245.99s -> 10247.75s]  I lost.
[10247.75s -> 10250.95s]  Into the green holes, the only way to get points.
[10250.95s -> 10252.38s]  That's it.
[10252.38s -> 10253.42s]  That's the game.
[10253.42s -> 10257.02s]  If you can get, all these are worth one point, by the way.
[10257.02s -> 10264.12s]  If you get to five points, I'll fucking,
[10264.12s -> 10266.60s]  I'll tap on street, I don't know, what do you want?
[10266.60s -> 10269.95s]  What do you guys want from me?
[10269.95s -> 10272.03s]  Five points, then you get to live with it
[10272.03s -> 10273.19s]  for the rest of your life.
[10273.19s -> 10275.15s]  And you collectively, I don't even know how many people
[10275.15s -> 10278.44s]  are watching, there could be 100, there could be 100,000.
[10278.44s -> 10280.08s]  How many people are watching, you get to live with that
[10280.08s -> 10281.40s]  for the rest of your life and you won a game
[10281.40s -> 10283.24s]  with a bunch of people.
[10283.24s -> 10286.48s]  So if you could, work together.
[10286.48s -> 10288.24s]  Make it happen and have fun.
[10289.98s -> 10295.70s]  Good luck.
[10295.70s -> 10299.38s]  We're setting up the bot, making it work.
[10299.62s -> 10300.62s]  I actually, I still can't believe
[10300.62s -> 10302.92s]  they only got like $11.
[10302.92s -> 10305.61s]  What, like 300 bucks to come in?
[10305.61s -> 10308.69s]  That kind of sucks.
[10308.69s -> 10310.89s]  I gotta say, this room is very expensive.
[10310.89s -> 10312.59s]  I'm gonna have to hit them.
[10312.59s -> 10317.00s]  I'm gonna have to try, I'm gonna have to take it alone.
[10317.00s -> 10319.28s]  All right, let's go.
[10319.28s -> 10322.08s]  Whiffle balls, they travel differently than the frogs.
[10322.08s -> 10323.68s]  The same machine, different game.
[10323.68s -> 10327.90s]  Keep that in mind, the controls are on the screen.
[10327.90s -> 10331.56s]  You're looking for the green holes.
[10331.56s -> 10333.40s]  Not the yellow ones, the green ones.
[10333.40s -> 10337.84s]  Get them in the green ones, only, please.
[10337.88s -> 10340.49s]  Otherwise, I'll be very upset with you
[10340.49s -> 10342.73s]  and I'll start fucking talking shit.
[10342.73s -> 10344.27s]  You don't wanna hear that.
[10344.27s -> 10346.52s]  But hey, you probably don't wanna hear me.
[10346.52s -> 10349.81s]  Maybe better off if I stopped talking at all.
[10349.81s -> 10351.37s]  Oh my goodness, guys.
[10351.37s -> 10356.50s]  Holy shit, not even on the board?
[10356.50s -> 10359.15s]  That's not good.
[10359.15s -> 10362.02s]  Get your whole family here, maybe they'll help you.
[10362.02s -> 10366.24s]  Call your siblings, your grandfather, your grandmother.
[10366.24s -> 10367.96s]  That was pathetic.
[10367.96s -> 10370.24s]  I'm just gonna call it like I see it.
[10370.24s -> 10371.64s]  You fell off an edge in Dark Souls,
[10371.64s -> 10372.48s]  that's what you did.
[10372.48s -> 10374.64s]  That's kinda how I can tell you how that was.
[10375.94s -> 10377.82s]  Green holes, I know you can do it.
[10379.04s -> 10381.12s]  Sun is shining, you're here.
[10383.03s -> 10385.43s]  You got a little bit more control, I think.
[10385.43s -> 10386.47s]  That's not bad.
[10388.19s -> 10393.01s]  Not bad.
[10393.01s -> 10394.92s]  More.
[10394.92s -> 10398.28s]  You gotta get it in the game board, at least.
[10398.28s -> 10403.51s]  Not just, you gotta get the right spot.
[10403.51s -> 10409.57s]  Here it comes, zero, all the way in the corner.
[10409.57s -> 10413.30s]  That is not any points.
[10414.22s -> 10416.58s]  You're kinda close, but not really.
[10416.58s -> 10423.75s]  Kinda close, but not really.
[10423.75s -> 10427.83s]  You have quite a few chances here.
[10427.83s -> 10430.71s]  Going for green.
[10430.71s -> 10432.72s]  Green only.
[10432.72s -> 10435.60s]  Here, here, here, here.
[10435.60s -> 10438.76s]  There, there, they're random.
[10438.76s -> 10441.68s]  So it's not, they're all in one spot.
[10441.68s -> 10446.40s]  15 seconds, come on.
[10446.40s -> 10450.10s]  Cue it up.
[10450.10s -> 10450.94s]  Do it.
[10457.08s -> 10466.47s]  Fuck off, come on.
[10466.47s -> 10469.59s]  I'm walking around doing a presentation
[10469.59s -> 10473.23s]  and everybody wants to fire at the presenter.
[10473.23s -> 10474.43s]  Hey, that guy walking around,
[10474.43s -> 10477.68s]  why don't we take fire at that guy's face?
[10477.68s -> 10480.61s]  Like we did last time.
[10480.61s -> 10482.97s]  You got 20 seconds to do this.
[10482.97s -> 10492.56s]  Line it up.
[10492.56s -> 10501.32s]  Two in the corner, don't aim in the corner.
[10501.32s -> 10508.39s]  Oh, they're not close enough.
[10508.39s -> 10511.27s]  Now the balls stay, so that helps.
[10511.27s -> 10514.46s]  But you do gotta get three points.
[10514.46s -> 10517.57s]  Otherwise you lose.
[10517.57s -> 10523.50s]  You'll lose if you don't get three points.
[10523.50s -> 10532.52s]  Wink.
[10532.52s -> 10540.48s]  I'll leave it, I'm not gonna fuck around, I'll leave it.
[10540.48s -> 10543.04s]  I would try to go short, not go long,
[10543.04s -> 10549.72s]  because then it'll roll.
[10549.72s -> 10553.97s]  Oh, almost, not quite.
[10553.97s -> 10561.17s]  So close, so close, so far.
[10561.17s -> 10563.73s]  You don't win unless you get it in the green.
[10563.73s -> 10567.28s]  I'm sorry to say, I hate to crush your dreams here.
[10567.28s -> 10572.03s]  And you gotta get three of these.
[10572.03s -> 10574.03s]  You want a shotgun blast at one of these?
[10574.03s -> 10578.08s]  Maybe, for fun?
[10578.08s -> 10579.40s]  Because remember, you gotta go,
[10579.40s -> 10582.04s]  once they fill in a little, you have a chance here.
[10582.04s -> 10585.68s]  I would go for the left side, but that's me.
[10585.68s -> 10603.10s]  I'm not you.
[10603.10s -> 10604.86s]  It got stuck.
[10604.86s -> 10607.72s]  But you aimed it wrong anyways.
[10607.72s -> 10610.09s]  The wind is like pushing it.
[10610.09s -> 10611.77s]  I'll give you a wind denominator, ready?
[10611.77s -> 10613.63s]  Watch this, ready?
[10613.63s -> 10616.33s]  See?
[10616.33s -> 10622.08s]  Wind's going this way.
[10622.08s -> 10628.36s]  I mean, these balls sure are bouncy.
[10628.36s -> 10632.72s]  Hey, I can't believe how bouncy these balls are.
[10632.72s -> 10635.14s]  Jeez, I can't believe it.
[10635.14s -> 10637.71s]  What the heck is going on here?
[10637.71s -> 10640.99s]  This is a bouncy grass.
[10640.99s -> 10647.57s]  I'm a trained magician, at least they're pretending.
[10647.57s -> 10661.20s]  Right here, they'll get it right now.
[10661.20s -> 10663.30s]  Too high.
[10663.30s -> 10669.34s]  Pull it down.
[10669.34s -> 10673.95s]  Let me help you.
[10673.95s -> 10675.95s]  See, normally Akani would not do that for you,
[10675.95s -> 10677.91s]  but I just filled in a few more slots.
[10681.62s -> 10686.62s]  The hammer is like trying to come down so bad.
[10686.62s -> 10687.82s]  And this is the real deal, by the way.
[10687.82s -> 10688.66s]  Take a look at that.
[10688.66s -> 10689.50s]  Look at that engineering.
[10689.50s -> 10694.52s]  This thing is the actual real deal.
[10694.52s -> 10699.23s]  Not a bad spot.
[10699.23s -> 10711.19s]  You gotta get one point, otherwise what a waste of time.
[10711.19s -> 10719.62s]  Zero.
[10719.62s -> 10721.90s]  You don't get points for getting almost there.
[10721.90s -> 10728.12s]  You only get points for getting there.
[10728.12s -> 10732.15s]  One point is worth a pretend sneeze on camera.
[10732.15s -> 10734.73s]  Just in case you're curious.
[10734.73s -> 10736.57s]  I'll do like a funny, I love how I laugh out loud.
[10736.57s -> 10738.01s]  Sneeze on camera.
[10738.01s -> 10741.28s]  That's what that's worth.
[10741.28s -> 10748.60s]  That's what that's worth.
[10748.60s -> 10750.96s]  I love watching it just fight.
[10750.96s -> 10752.56s]  I love watching the little like.
[10764.48s -> 10767.80s]  Judging, that's not even in a hole.
[10767.80s -> 10771.00s]  You got four in the same corner.
[10771.96s -> 10773.72s]  Judging by how much is in here,
[10773.72s -> 10775.72s]  I would probably pull it out a little.
[10775.72s -> 10780.77s]  You gotta come out just like a full foot this way.
[10780.77s -> 10784.20s]  You guys are going way too far into this corner.
[10784.20s -> 10794.33s]  Pull it back a little.
[10794.33s -> 10804.64s]  Hi, okay, sure.
[10804.64s -> 10811.59s]  Let's see what you do.
[10811.59s -> 10817.66s]  Let's try.
[10817.66s -> 10825.39s]  There, I'm just, I'm filling holes for you guys.
[10825.39s -> 10831.40s]  These don't hurt like the frogs do, the frog hurt.
[10831.40s -> 10834.24s]  Green means go, red means stop.
[10834.24s -> 10842.00s]  You know the controls by now.
[10842.00s -> 10844.93s]  Right here, this way, this way.
[10844.93s -> 10846.37s]  Pull it right there.
[10846.41s -> 10851.67s]  You can do it right here.
[10851.67s -> 10855.70s]  Yes, yes, more.
[10855.70s -> 10856.58s]  That's gonna be the one.
[10856.58s -> 10857.42s]  That's it right there.
[10857.42s -> 10858.34s]  That's a point, I think.
[10858.34s -> 10859.18s]  That's a point.
[10874.68s -> 10876.45s]  I thought you guys were gonna do it.
[10876.45s -> 10878.29s]  You tried though, almost.
[10878.29s -> 10881.20s]  Look at all these, look at this.
[10881.20s -> 10885.08s]  One over, one over, two over, one over.
[10902.71s -> 10905.58s]  Do it.
[10905.58s -> 10906.86s]  There you go.
[10906.86s -> 10908.55s]  Bingo.
[10908.55s -> 10910.11s]  That's one.
[10910.11s -> 10910.93s]  What did I say?
[10910.93s -> 10911.77s]  Oh, right, sorry.
[10911.77s -> 10918.48s]  Let me switch to this camera over here.
[10918.48s -> 10919.80s]  Get to this camera here.
[10919.80s -> 10921.24s]  Please, get to this camera.
[10921.24s -> 10924.41s]  This one over here, if you can for a second.
[10924.41s -> 10926.45s]  I wanted to clear.
[10926.45s -> 10928.49s]  Switch this one here.
[10928.49s -> 10930.86s]  Yeah, switch this one over here.
[10930.86s -> 10932.28s]  You good?
[10932.28s -> 10939.56s]  Thank you.
[10939.56s -> 10941.04s]  What a stupid fucking shitty prize.
[10941.04s -> 10946.74s]  Whatever, keep going.
[10946.74s -> 10949.62s]  Imagine you go to a carnival and the guy's like,
[10949.62s -> 10952.26s]  hey, it's $5 for two balls.
[10952.26s -> 10953.18s]  If you get one point,
[10953.18s -> 10956.42s]  I'll sneeze in front of your girlfriend.
[10956.42s -> 10961.04s]  Okay, see you later.
[10961.04s -> 10966.25s]  It was nice to meet you.
[10966.25s -> 10968.01s]  What's your boyfriend's name?
[10968.01s -> 10968.85s]  Greg?
[10968.85s -> 10969.67s]  Hey Greg, how are you?
[10969.67s -> 10971.78s]  My name's Steve.
[10971.78s -> 10978.11s]  Thanks.
[10978.11s -> 10984.79s]  You got one though, three is worth something else.
[10984.79s -> 10987.58s]  No, I thought I was gonna keep rolling.
[10987.58s -> 10990.20s]  Good, you got one.
[10990.20s -> 10996.61s]  You got one, that's all it takes to get a sneeze.
[10996.61s -> 11001.79s]  Top 192 variety streamer on Twitch.
[11004.86s -> 11008.26s]  I've been the top 500 variety sneeze streamers
[11008.26s -> 11009.82s]  on Twitch TV.
[11009.82s -> 11016.08s]  Very proud of that.
[11016.08s -> 11020.17s]  What did he say?
[11020.17s -> 11021.73s]  Have I dropped down a few spots?
[11032.84s -> 11038.28s]  No, look at that.
[11038.28s -> 11041.96s]  Look at, you guys are so close to the connect four.
[11041.96s -> 11048.42s]  Look, you need one, look at how good that is.
[11048.42s -> 11049.68s]  It's just not good enough.
[11052.45s -> 11058.52s]  So close.
[11058.52s -> 11060.36s]  You think the ball standing would help?
[11060.36s -> 11070.25s]  Apparently not.
[11070.25s -> 11072.27s]  Good, I like the angle.
[11072.27s -> 11078.17s]  I like the angle being used here.
[11078.17s -> 11082.64s]  What happens if I get three points, what do I do?
[11082.64s -> 11084.24s]  Should I elbow drop the table?
[11086.26s -> 11091.76s]  Come on, shit.
[11091.76s -> 11094.28s]  Should I just elbow drop right in the middle?
[11094.28s -> 11095.92s]  You guys win.
[11095.92s -> 11101.66s]  Probably break my elbow.
[11101.66s -> 11103.62s]  Let me, I wanna see what you guys are saying.
[11103.62s -> 11107.56s]  I wanna go see the chat.
[11107.56s -> 11109.60s]  How's it going?
[11109.60s -> 11110.94s]  You guys capable of this shit?
[11110.94s -> 11113.13s]  I know you are, come on.
[11113.13s -> 11113.95s]  Give us the goat.
[11113.95s -> 11116.54s]  You don't get the goat unless you get two.
[11116.54s -> 11121.48s]  If you get two, you get the goat.
[11121.48s -> 11123.28s]  We get your feet if there's three balls.
[11123.28s -> 11125.54s]  That's not gonna happen.
[11125.54s -> 11128.04s]  I can't, I'm so sad that that turned into a thing.
[11129.06s -> 11131.02s]  Say Peter for the next point.
[11131.02s -> 11136.00s]  No.
[11136.00s -> 11138.85s]  No, too low.
[11138.85s -> 11140.19s]  That was such a miss.
[11144.10s -> 11146.96s]  I wanna see the goat's feet.
[11146.96s -> 11149.03s]  Why?
[11149.03s -> 11153.08s]  Why do you wanna see that?
[11153.08s -> 11159.20s]  That was too low and too high, yeah.
[11159.20s -> 11163.72s]  You guys are crazy.
[11163.72s -> 11166.31s]  Come on, turn it.
[11166.31s -> 11167.91s]  We're not making it easy for you.
[11177.17s -> 11181.31s]  That's not bad.
[11181.31s -> 11183.03s]  No, it's over.
[11183.03s -> 11190.08s]  Way over.
[11190.08s -> 11191.20s]  Way over.
[11192.75s -> 11194.43s]  Not bad.
[11194.43s -> 11202.07s]  You're not gonna do it.
[11202.07s -> 11203.79s]  You're going too low.
[11216.26s -> 11217.70s]  Two is for the goat.
[11217.70s -> 11220.93s]  Yeah, if you get two points, you get a goat.
[11220.93s -> 11223.57s]  And I'll hold it up so you can see it on screen.
[11223.57s -> 11225.13s]  You can screenshot it.
[11225.13s -> 11226.93s]  Cause I ain't sending everybody goats.
[11228.17s -> 11230.05s]  That whole corner is now taken up.
[11230.05s -> 11231.37s]  Here, ready?
[11231.37s -> 11232.53s]  Give me your hand here.
[11233.92s -> 11241.62s]  There it is.
[11241.62s -> 11246.09s]  Two, get two.
[11246.09s -> 11248.03s]  You know what, I'll help you out even more.
[11248.03s -> 11252.39s]  How much help do you guys need?
[11252.39s -> 11256.35s]  How much do you think?
[11256.35s -> 11262.81s]  Shit.
[11266.14s -> 11266.98s]  Right there.
[11266.98s -> 11268.90s]  Do it.
[11268.90s -> 11275.84s]  How much coaching do you need?
[11275.84s -> 11280.13s]  No score.
[11280.13s -> 11281.93s]  You're running out of space to put these,
[11281.93s -> 11287.46s]  but I can see where you're going with them, right?
[11287.46s -> 11289.91s]  You can see where you're going with these.
[11289.91s -> 11293.96s]  Mostly on the right side is where you're going.
[11293.96s -> 11294.92s]  Not a whole lot on the left.
[11294.92s -> 11297.48s]  Take one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[11297.48s -> 11299.40s]  More than 10 shots on the right.
[11299.40s -> 11301.75s]  Less than six on the left.
[11301.75s -> 11304.62s]  You might wanna go for the left here.
[11304.62s -> 11306.35s]  That would probably help.
[11306.35s -> 11307.39s]  Cause remember, it bounces around.
[11307.39s -> 11310.31s]  So it would bounce into the corner back over here,
[11310.31s -> 11317.89s]  but you're going too far.
[11317.89s -> 11321.51s]  Damn.
[11321.51s -> 11325.67s]  At least you got a sneeze.
[11325.67s -> 11327.27s]  At least you got a sneeze.
[11327.27s -> 11343.87s]  Hey, let me help.
[11343.87s -> 11351.56s]  Come on.
[11351.56s -> 11362.73s]  Do it for Wailord.
[11362.73s -> 11363.57s]  Okay.
[11363.57s -> 11364.39s]  All right.
[11364.39s -> 11366.08s]  Hold on.
[11366.08s -> 11367.08s]  Keep playing, guys.
[11367.08s -> 11368.20s]  I mean, like, for real.
[11368.20s -> 11370.28s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[11370.28s -> 11384.18s]  I mean, like, give me a break.
[11384.18s -> 11385.02s]  Guys.
[11385.02s -> 11386.98s]  I mean, if you can't do it, you can't do it.
[11401.00s -> 11401.84s]  I'm trying to help you.
[11401.84s -> 11406.51s]  I really am.
[11406.55s -> 11409.18s]  What the hell was that?
[11409.18s -> 11410.02s]  Okay.
[11410.02s -> 11410.84s]  Go on, go on.
[11410.84s -> 11411.68s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[11411.68s -> 11412.50s]  Let's go.
[11412.50s -> 11413.34s]  You got like six extra spots.
[11413.34s -> 11414.18s]  Come on.
[11414.18s -> 11415.02s]  I know you can just do it.
[11415.02s -> 11422.22s]  Two points.
[11422.22s -> 11430.04s]  You got like a three or four extra spots now.
[11430.04s -> 11430.96s]  Come on.
[11430.96s -> 11431.80s]  Look at, look at that.
[11431.80s -> 11437.58s]  Look, look, look.
[11437.58s -> 11438.70s]  Look at how many spots you got there.
[11438.70s -> 11440.50s]  You need two points for a go.
[11440.50s -> 11444.91s]  Do it.
[11444.91s -> 11446.03s]  Come on.
[11446.03s -> 11454.44s]  At this point, it's impossible to lose.
[11454.44s -> 11456.44s]  Oh, come on, come on.
[11456.44s -> 11457.28s]  Wait a minute.
[11457.28s -> 11470.24s]  Just shoot it in this fucking corner.
[11475.25s -> 11476.93s]  Get it in that corner.
[11476.93s -> 11479.85s]  Just get it in the corner and you can win the game.
[11483.16s -> 11485.24s]  Oh shit.
[11485.24s -> 11487.24s]  Hey, can we get that water jug back over here?
[11487.24s -> 11488.08s]  Oh, it's.
[11495.78s -> 11496.62s]  All right.
[11496.62s -> 11498.38s]  That's not coming off.
[11498.38s -> 11502.81s]  It's green forever.
[11502.81s -> 11508.56s]  Just get it in the corner and just please win the game.
[11508.56s -> 11527.43s]  All you have to do is get it in that quadrant.
[11527.43s -> 11540.48s]  That's two points.
[11540.48s -> 11542.46s]  Get three, please.
[11542.46s -> 11543.62s]  Just get three.
[11543.62s -> 11546.79s]  Just get three so we can move on.
[11546.79s -> 11547.99s]  Just get three points so we can move on, please.
[11547.99s -> 11549.51s]  Thank you.
[11549.51s -> 11551.79s]  If you aim over here, you're an idiot.
[11551.79s -> 11554.35s]  I just want to make sure we're clear.
[11554.35s -> 11557.07s]  If you aim to the right, you might be an imbecile.
[11557.07s -> 11563.00s]  I just want to make sure that we got to be very good.
[11563.00s -> 11563.84s]  Go on.
[11563.84s -> 11565.00s]  Let's go.
[11565.00s -> 11566.08s]  Do it.
[11566.08s -> 11566.92s]  Do it.
[11566.92s -> 11567.76s]  Come on.
[11567.76s -> 11568.96s]  Right in the teeth.
[11568.96s -> 11571.08s]  Hey, but break all my front row.
[11571.08s -> 11573.64s]  Break the whole front row of teeth.
[11573.64s -> 11574.56s]  Right there.
[11574.56s -> 11575.40s]  Come on.
[11590.81s -> 11591.77s]  Damn.
[11591.77s -> 11592.69s]  Do another one.
[11592.69s -> 11593.69s]  Do another one.
[11593.69s -> 11594.69s]  Do another one.
[11594.69s -> 11596.33s]  I can't touch my face.
[11596.33s -> 11598.05s]  I can't touch my face.
[11598.05s -> 11599.49s]  If I touch my face, it's pain on my face
[11599.49s -> 11601.15s]  for the rest of the day.
[11601.15s -> 11601.99s]  That way.
[11601.99s -> 11602.81s]  That way.
[11602.81s -> 11608.14s]  I'll pick it up and put it over there.
[11608.14s -> 11611.08s]  Go for it.
[11613.29s -> 11615.82s]  In there.
[11615.82s -> 11617.60s]  In there.
[11617.60s -> 11618.44s]  There you go.
[11618.44s -> 11619.26s]  There you go.
[11619.26s -> 11620.88s]  There you go.
[11620.88s -> 11622.36s]  You're way off.
[11622.36s -> 11623.36s]  You are so way off.
[11623.36s -> 11624.20s]  It's not even funny.
[11624.20s -> 11625.04s]  More to this way.
[11625.04s -> 11628.61s]  There's like, there's like a pain over here.
[11628.61s -> 11629.61s]  Good.
[11629.61s -> 11630.45s]  More power.
[11630.45s -> 11631.27s]  No, no, no, no.
[11631.27s -> 11632.11s]  More power.
[11632.11s -> 11632.95s]  More, more, more, more, more, more, more power.
[11632.95s -> 11633.77s]  More power.
[11633.77s -> 11635.04s]  That's not enough.
[11635.04s -> 11636.67s]  That's not enough.
[11636.67s -> 11639.46s]  More.
[11639.46s -> 11640.92s]  More.
[11640.92s -> 11643.83s]  More.
[11643.83s -> 11649.58s]  Give me the ball.
[11649.58s -> 11650.42s]  Hey, wow.
[11650.42s -> 11651.26s]  Would you look at that?
[11651.26s -> 11652.46s]  I can't believe you got swans.
[11652.46s -> 11654.06s]  You actually did it.
[11654.06s -> 11655.06s]  Holy crap.
[11655.06s -> 11656.90s]  Holy heck.
[11656.90s -> 11657.74s]  You got a point.
[11657.74s -> 11658.70s]  You got three points there.
[11658.70s -> 11660.18s]  Holy heck-a-rito.
[11660.18s -> 11662.84s]  I can't believe it.
[11662.84s -> 11672.08s]  So, coming up next is a group of clowns.
[11672.28s -> 11673.84s]  We've got cuddles.
[11673.84s -> 11676.76s]  We've got Miss Polly Polite.
[11676.76s -> 11678.14s]  There they go.
[11678.14s -> 11689.23s]  Bring them out.
[11689.23s -> 11691.24s]  Wait, am I on camera?
[11691.24s -> 11692.24s]  Oh, shit.
[11692.24s -> 11693.08s]  I'm on camera.
[11694.04s -> 11697.12s]  Hey, we got cuddles and Polly Polite.
[11702.88s -> 11704.68s]  We've got to go to those two.
[11709.36s -> 11710.20s]  Oh.
[11710.20s -> 11711.02s]  I'm awesome.
[11711.02s -> 11711.86s]  What do you have?
[11711.86s -> 11712.96s]  I am not having.
[11712.96s -> 11713.80s]  Cuddles, easy.
[11713.80s -> 11714.64s]  You came.
[11714.64s -> 11716.44s]  You unpack it, put it on the tray,
[11716.44s -> 11717.28s]  and bring it over to me.
[11717.28s -> 11718.84s]  I'm gonna get ready.
[11718.84s -> 11719.68s]  All right.
[11719.68s -> 11724.50s]  All right, all right.
[11724.50s -> 11725.34s]  I'm coming back.
[11725.34s -> 11726.16s]  Just leave it out there.
[11726.16s -> 11727.00s]  I'm gonna need a bag.
[11727.00s -> 11768.40s]  A bag, a bag, a bag.
[11768.40s -> 11782.92s]  A bag, a bag.
[11782.92s -> 11784.44s]  Okay, cuddles.
[11784.44s -> 11785.84s]  Put it on the tray and bring it over to me.
[11785.84s -> 11788.84s]  I've got it all ready for you now.
[11788.84s -> 11790.48s]  I got the bandana and everything.
[11790.48s -> 11798.31s]  All right, all right, all right.
[11798.31s -> 11811.60s]  Just because you want to be there.
[11811.60s -> 11814.62s]  Magic in a box.
[11814.62s -> 11820.56s]  This is the magic bandana trick.
[11820.56s -> 11823.28s]  The Acme Company wants to thank you
[11823.28s -> 11827.19s]  for purchasing this month's trick in a box.
[11827.19s -> 11829.79s]  Empty the contents onto a tray
[11829.79s -> 11831.55s]  and place it in front of you.
[11834.00s -> 11837.52s]  Now, we're going to learn some magic.
[11840.69s -> 11847.04s]  We're going to make bandana disappear.
[11847.04s -> 11849.92s]  First, pick up the bandana.
[11853.49s -> 11858.36s]  Now, fold it in half.
[11858.36s -> 11859.34s]  That's right.
[11859.34s -> 11868.52s]  Fold it in half.
[11868.52s -> 11878.12s]  Fold it one more time.
[11878.12s -> 11880.94s]  Take the folded bandana
[11880.94s -> 11884.48s]  and secretly hide it in your left hand.
[11887.58s -> 11890.96s]  Keep your hand in a natural position.
[11890.96s -> 11893.90s]  This is known as palming.
[11896.89s -> 11898.45s]  Open up the folded bandana.
[11901.89s -> 11904.69s]  Greet the audience by waving it up and down.
[11911.02s -> 11915.81s]  Hey, to prove it's a real bandana,
[11917.38s -> 11921.41s]  why don't you wipe your face with it
[11921.41s -> 11925.74s]  or use it to blow your nose?
[11931.77s -> 11945.04s]  Pick up the red scarf.
[11945.04s -> 11958.90s]  Now, gather the four corners together and make a pouch.
[11958.90s -> 11959.74s]  Doing okay?
[11973.62s -> 11976.06s]  Fold the bandana on the same line
[11976.06s -> 11977.66s]  that you previously folded it.
[11981.16s -> 11986.16s]  When you have done that, place the bandana in the pouch.
[11987.08s -> 11993.09s]  Squeeze it tightly.
[11993.09s -> 12005.09s]  What the audience doesn't know
[12006.01s -> 12011.01s]  is that you never really put the bandana in the pouch.
[12011.21s -> 12014.87s]  You kept it in your left hand, right?
[12014.87s -> 12016.29s]  Remember, palming.
[12028.20s -> 12031.16s]  Make a magical gesture over the bag
[12031.16s -> 12035.00s]  and fling it open and await your just applause.
[12041.28s -> 12044.16s]  Finneum, tell me about that.
[12044.16s -> 12045.64s]  I don't remember.
[12045.64s -> 12046.48s]  Where's the bandana?
[12046.48s -> 12047.72s]  It's all gone.
[12047.72s -> 12048.56s]  The bandana's gone?
[12048.56s -> 12049.82s]  I ate it.
[12049.82s -> 12051.24s]  You ate your bandana?
[12051.24s -> 12052.08s]  Yeah.
[12052.08s -> 12054.88s]  Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you why, why, why.
[12054.88s -> 12056.36s]  No, why, I'll tell you why.
[12056.36s -> 12057.20s]  Why I meant to, why I meant to.
[12057.20s -> 12058.68s]  I was like, that was really great.
[12058.68s -> 12060.92s]  Yeah, I, I, I, you look over there
[12060.92s -> 12062.72s]  because I've got something over here that I want to show you.
[12062.72s -> 12064.80s]  Come on, you can turn around and look at me, see?
[12064.80s -> 12066.88s]  Because I want to show you something that I've got.
[12066.88s -> 12068.28s]  You see, can you see that right there?
[12068.28s -> 12069.44s]  Oh, I can see that.
[12069.44s -> 12070.28s]  I can see that.
[12070.28s -> 12074.64s]  Well, basically, there's just all of these cards here.
[12074.64s -> 12076.88s]  Now, I want you to concentrate on one of the cards.
[12076.88s -> 12079.12s]  Now, I don't care which card it is, but just concentrate.
[12079.12s -> 12080.40s]  Don't tell me, don't tell me.
[12080.40s -> 12082.16s]  All right, I'm gonna pick a card.
[12082.16s -> 12083.00s]  I'm gonna pick, I'm gonna pick.
[12083.00s -> 12088.78s]  Yeah, you don't need to spin around, just pick the card.
[12088.78s -> 12092.44s]  Nevermind, don't tell me.
[12092.44s -> 12093.40s]  You're pointing at it.
[12093.40s -> 12095.28s]  That's not good because, you know,
[12095.28s -> 12098.72s]  see what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make that card disappear
[12098.72s -> 12099.80s]  because you're gonna look at me.
[12099.80s -> 12100.64s]  Yes, you are.
[12100.64s -> 12102.88s]  You're gonna look up right there at me.
[12102.88s -> 12105.40s]  Yeah, and you're gonna concentrate
[12105.40s -> 12106.68s]  on the card that you picked.
[12106.68s -> 12107.56s]  Right, just stop.
[12107.56s -> 12108.88s]  Not so close.
[12108.88s -> 12110.16s]  I don't trust you.
[12110.16s -> 12112.40s]  Just concentrate on the card, yeah.
[12113.36s -> 12116.08s]  Poly, poly, yeah, you'll be a very poly, yes, you will.
[12116.08s -> 12119.13s]  All right, concentrate, you're concentrating on it.
[12119.17s -> 12121.09s]  All right, I'm gonna make it disappear.
[12127.57s -> 12128.57s]  Is your card there?
[12128.57s -> 12133.94s]  Oh, oh, somebody stole my card cuddles, it's gone.
[12133.94s -> 12136.74s]  No, it's because I'm smart, you know, I'm very smart.
[12136.74s -> 12138.58s]  My card is gone.
[12138.58s -> 12141.46s]  I'm a very, very, very good magician.
[12141.46s -> 12144.18s]  You're pretty smart up here.
[12144.18s -> 12145.02s]  Yeah, you know that?
[12145.02s -> 12145.86s]  You respect your elders.
[12145.86s -> 12147.30s]  Pretty smart.
[12147.30s -> 12148.26s]  You respect your elders.
[12148.26s -> 12149.34s]  Right.
[12149.34s -> 12151.66s]  Okay, well, that's all for right now
[12151.66s -> 12153.94s]  because I think I'm gonna have to get rid of some of that.
[12153.94s -> 12155.34s]  I'm gonna take that banana.
[12155.34s -> 12158.30s]  Yeah, yeah, okay, see ya, bye.
[12158.30s -> 12159.14s]  That trick.
[12163.82s -> 12165.92s]  Okay.
[12179.20s -> 12180.04s]  What is this?
[12182.93s -> 12184.81s]  Hehehehehehehehehe.
[12184.81s -> 12188.87s]  I think those used the wrong one.
[12192.97s -> 12195.13s]  Used the wrong one.
[12195.13s -> 12196.43s]  Oh, hi, cuddles.
[12199.05s -> 12204.93s]  I'm not a private with my Nana.
[12204.93s -> 12206.89s]  You can wipe.
[12206.89s -> 12208.77s]  I gotta go get some water.
[12208.77s -> 12210.13s]  I want some water.
[12210.13s -> 12211.65s]  Go get your own water.
[12211.65s -> 12213.15s]  Okay, I can get my own water.
[12213.15s -> 12214.99s]  All right, thank you very much.
[12214.99s -> 12216.23s]  Thank you very much.
[12216.23s -> 12218.31s]  You're so nice to me.
[12218.31s -> 12223.31s]  Okay, oh food, you know, I gotta tell you,
[12223.55s -> 12225.99s]  I don't think she's got it yet.
[12225.99s -> 12228.71s]  She did pretty good on that trip though.
[12228.71s -> 12232.75s]  The secret is, is I never gave her the pan.
[12232.75s -> 12233.75s]  Oh, I didn't.
[12235.07s -> 12240.16s]  It's the tray and she didn't even.
[12240.16s -> 12243.96s]  I gotta tell you, I took a banana.
[12243.96s -> 12245.63s]  I was gonna eat it.
[12246.21s -> 12252.06s]  It's been a long day and I'm really tired.
[12252.06s -> 12256.26s]  I took the banana and she went like this.
[12256.26s -> 12262.60s]  She folded it like that and I can't eat it
[12262.60s -> 12265.32s]  because now it's a folded banana.
[12267.35s -> 12270.31s]  And I don't know what happened to the yellow banana.
[12270.31s -> 12276.56s]  It disappeared.
[12276.56s -> 12278.36s]  Thank you very much.
[12278.36s -> 12280.96s]  If I can bring you back over here to the carnival section,
[12280.96s -> 12283.44s]  the arcade section of the stream.
[12283.44s -> 12284.28s]  Thank you again.
[12284.82s -> 12286.82s]  Cuddles and Polyphilite.
[12286.82s -> 12290.38s]  Doing great work over there as the two best clowns,
[12290.38s -> 12291.22s]  probably in the universe.
[12291.22s -> 12293.62s]  I still got pain all over me still.
[12293.62s -> 12296.50s]  Anyways, what kind of, we're gonna be playing Pac-Man
[12296.50s -> 12298.30s]  for a little bit because we're in the arcade now.
[12298.30s -> 12300.66s]  Welcome back to the German 95 arcade experience.
[12301.58s -> 12303.54s]  As you see, we got Pac-Man and Pac-Man Plus.
[12303.54s -> 12306.42s]  We're gonna play, this is a video game stream, right?
[12306.42s -> 12308.42s]  Sometimes has to be for a little bit.
[12309.70s -> 12310.98s]  Do we have audio on this thing?
[12310.98s -> 12311.82s]  Let's find out.
[12314.34s -> 12315.90s]  Does it have audio?
[12315.96s -> 12316.80s]  Can you hear it?
[12320.39s -> 12321.23s]  Oh!
[12335.04s -> 12340.88s]  Don't go for it just yet.
[12340.88s -> 12341.76s]  Bait him around the corner.
[12341.76s -> 12343.00s]  Oh, did you see that fucking play?
[12343.00s -> 12346.70s]  That was the best play I've done all day.
[12346.70s -> 12348.66s]  Remember I told you this didn't work?
[12348.66s -> 12349.66s]  Oh, that was a lie.
[12352.01s -> 12354.17s]  I have one of the top 50 times.
[12354.17s -> 12355.61s]  This is so fucking loud.
[12355.61s -> 12356.89s]  I have one of the top 50.
[12356.89s -> 12360.36s]  Okay, I lost, but that's okay because, you know,
[12360.36s -> 12361.86s]  I have one of the top, I don't have any high score.
[12361.86s -> 12362.70s]  I'm just lying.
[12362.70s -> 12363.52s]  Let's go.
[12364.84s -> 12367.76s]  We're doing this for a little bit just so.
[12367.76s -> 12369.02s]  There we go, that's better.
[12369.02s -> 12371.82s]  Just so we have an opportunity to set up the next event,
[12372.76s -> 12374.90s]  which the clowns are.
[12375.98s -> 12377.78s]  The clowns are fucking hot right there.
[12377.78s -> 12379.02s]  I'm gonna give it a break.
[12383.92s -> 12385.56s]  Come in a little tighter.
[12385.56s -> 12386.76s]  I want them to see this.
[12391.46s -> 12393.66s]  You know, they actually sell these.
[12393.66s -> 12397.10s]  They sell these machines at Walmart now.
[12399.10s -> 12400.82s]  They're really not that expensive.
[12404.93s -> 12407.65s]  You can get one of these for 300 bucks,
[12407.65s -> 12411.24s]  which is what we did.
[12411.24s -> 12412.48s]  Holy shit, that was good.
[12417.73s -> 12422.55s]  Doesn't even require quarters.
[12422.55s -> 12424.15s]  Come on, level one, level one, level one.
[12424.15s -> 12433.45s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[12433.45s -> 12438.82s]  Level one done.
[12438.82s -> 12440.86s]  I've actually never gotten to level two in Pac-Man.
[12440.86s -> 12442.54s]  I don't know what it looks like.
[12442.54s -> 12452.61s]  I guess it looks like this.
[12452.61s -> 12456.54s]  Louder.
[12456.54s -> 12462.08s]  Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[12462.08s -> 12464.12s]  I would never do that on screen,
[12464.12s -> 12465.62s]  or off screen for that matter.
[12465.62s -> 12466.92s]  I lost.
[12466.92s -> 12467.76s]  All right, I lost.
[12467.76s -> 12468.60s]  I don't know.
[12472.32s -> 12473.28s]  Come on, Pac-Man.
[12473.28s -> 12477.67s]  Let's see what you got.
[12477.67s -> 12479.31s]  Don't ever go for the balls first.
[12489.66s -> 12503.50s]  I don't, I don't, this, it came off.
[12503.50s -> 12504.78s]  How many things are gonna go wrong?
[12504.78s -> 12509.11s]  I don't know.
[12509.11s -> 12512.51s]  One, two, three, four.
[12512.51s -> 12513.75s]  God damn it, get it.
[12515.83s -> 12520.75s]  Yes.
[12520.75s -> 12522.95s]  Enki is faster than, Enki's faster.
[12522.95s -> 12527.02s]  Enki's faster than everybody.
[12527.02s -> 12536.24s]  I don't need that shit.
[12537.96s -> 12539.96s]  Up, down, right, left, down, up, go.
[12541.40s -> 12542.96s]  No, you guys don't get to play this one.
[12542.96s -> 12543.80s]  This is just me.
[12544.68s -> 12547.56s]  We didn't have the time to set that up.
[12547.56s -> 12551.40s]  So unfortunately, this is just a me thing, not a you thing.
[12551.40s -> 12552.24s]  Sorry.
[12566.61s -> 12577.92s]  The smallest things are hurting me.
[12577.92s -> 12582.57s]  Got it.
[12582.57s -> 12584.25s]  Two, three, get it.
[12584.25s -> 12585.09s]  What happened?
[12585.09s -> 12586.81s]  What's that, what, what, what, what does that mean?
[12587.03s -> 12588.66s]  What does that mean?
[12588.66s -> 12590.30s]  What's the ding, ding, ding, ding mean?
[12590.30s -> 12591.14s]  Did I win something?
[12591.14s -> 12595.20s]  What does it mean?
[12595.20s -> 12597.44s]  I've never seen level three before in Pac-Man.
[12597.44s -> 12598.64s]  I don't know what it looks like.
[12603.30s -> 12604.14s]  Don't get angry.
[12604.14s -> 12605.90s]  This is a fucking important screen.
[12612.22s -> 12615.53s]  All the way to the left, up.
[12615.53s -> 12616.73s]  Just go for it, just wait, wait, wait, just go.
[12616.73s -> 12624.06s]  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
[12628.78s -> 12630.66s]  Get it, get the, get the cutscene, quick.
[12630.66s -> 12634.17s]  Get in there quick, get, I want the whole thing.
[12634.17s -> 12635.33s]  Why are you not moving?
[12639.70s -> 12646.58s]  I did it, I won.
[12646.58s -> 12648.72s]  Why is it so loose?
[12648.72s -> 12650.64s]  This thing is so, this thing's gonna fall off
[12650.64s -> 12653.08s]  at any moment, seriously, even if I screw it in.
[12657.30s -> 12659.88s]  What an idiot.
[12659.88s -> 12662.08s]  Now it's, there's paint on this now, I've ruined it.
[12662.08s -> 12669.52s]  That's game over.
[12669.52s -> 12671.99s]  Nah, fuck it, I ain't playing again.
[12671.99s -> 12675.49s]  So what's gonna happen now is I am gonna do something
[12675.49s -> 12678.11s]  that has never been done before on the platform,
[12678.11s -> 12680.33s]  on Twitch, I'm talking total on Twitch.
[12680.33s -> 12683.75s]  What we're gonna do this time is we are going to do
[12684.31s -> 12687.37s]  Twitch play Pokemon, you've seen Twitch play
[12687.37s -> 12690.91s]  complete Dark Souls, Twitch control robots.
[12690.91s -> 12695.91s]  But, but, very important, have you ever seen,
[12696.86s -> 12700.18s]  have you ever in your life, and I mean in your entire
[12700.18s -> 12706.04s]  existence, seen Twitch versus the fucking broadcaster?
[12708.22s -> 12709.36s]  You have not.
[12709.36s -> 12712.82s]  Twitch fights broadcaster with controlled inputs,
[12712.82s -> 12716.12s]  put it on the screen please, come on, bring it in.
[12716.12s -> 12719.27s]  Get the commands on screen.
[12719.27s -> 12723.62s]  Twitch fights the guy in real life.
[12723.62s -> 12726.36s]  I'm going to wait for the commands.
[12726.36s -> 12727.24s]  You've got a left punch.
[12727.24s -> 12729.86s]  You've got a right punch.
[12729.86s -> 12731.18s]  Are we ready?
[12731.18s -> 12732.50s]  Tell me when to go.
[12732.50s -> 12734.04s]  Do we have action?
[12734.04s -> 12737.58s]  Are we doing inputs?
[12737.58s -> 12740.49s]  Jesus.
[12740.49s -> 12740.97s]  Ah, shit.
[12740.97s -> 12747.12s]  Ow, my elbow.
[12747.12s -> 12748.52s]  Don't go for the face.
[12748.52s -> 12751.61s]  Don't go for my face.
[12751.61s -> 12752.97s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[12752.97s -> 12754.29s]  stop, stop, stop, stop inputs.
[12754.29s -> 12756.53s]  Stop inputs.
[12756.53s -> 12758.21s]  We didn't even shake hands.
[12758.21s -> 12759.71s]  Please raise your hands.
[12759.79s -> 12763.28s]  We didn't even shake hands.
[12763.28s -> 12764.52s]  Please raise the right.
[12764.52s -> 12767.54s]  Thank you.
[12767.54s -> 12770.24s]  Don't trick me here.
[12770.24s -> 12771.40s]  There it is.
[12771.40s -> 12772.00s]  Ow, ow.
[12772.00s -> 12773.24s]  OK, all right.
[12773.24s -> 12774.56s]  Let's go.
[12774.56s -> 12775.44s]  Inputs are taking.
[12775.44s -> 12778.88s]  Let's go.
[12778.88s -> 12783.72s]  Eat that, huh?
[12783.72s -> 12784.76s]  Get in the hand.
[12784.76s -> 12785.32s]  Eat this.
[12785.32s -> 12785.92s]  Eat that.
[12785.92s -> 12786.84s]  Eat this.
[12786.84s -> 12788.08s]  Come on, what do you got?
[12788.08s -> 12788.56s]  Right in the face.
[12788.56s -> 12790.96s]  I'll give you a free shot.
[12790.96s -> 12798.25s]  Oh, he lost his head.
[12798.25s -> 12799.97s]  Well, he regenerated.
[12799.97s -> 12802.25s]  He has regeneration powers.
[12802.25s -> 12803.65s]  Wow, that's unbelievable.
[12803.65s -> 12804.93s]  Come on, right in the face.
[12804.93s -> 12810.70s]  Do A on your keyboard.
[12810.70s -> 12813.50s]  You're going to have 100,000 of you hit A at the same time.
[12813.50s -> 12814.90s]  All right, that was pretty close.
[12814.90s -> 12816.26s]  Pretty good.
[12816.26s -> 12817.34s]  Almost.
[12817.34s -> 12818.66s]  All right, you know what?
[12818.66s -> 12820.02s]  How about this, chat?
[12820.02s -> 12830.18s]  How about this one for you?
[12830.18s -> 12846.19s]  Yeah.
[12846.19s -> 12849.05s]  That means I win.
[12849.05s -> 12850.73s]  You thought you could fight the fucking streamer?
[12850.73s -> 12851.69s]  You thought you could beat him?
[12851.69s -> 12865.04s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12865.04s -> 12865.52s]  Give me this.
[12865.52s -> 12868.23s]  Give me this.
[12868.23s -> 12871.10s]  Ah.
[12871.10s -> 12874.55s]  What is this?
[12874.55s -> 12882.51s]  Oh, this looks like some kind of mechanism.
[12882.51s -> 12884.05s]  I always win.
[12884.05s -> 12887.07s]  Don't let anybody fool you.
[12887.07s -> 12888.27s]  You got one shot in the face.
[12888.27s -> 12890.14s]  That's all that mattered.
[12890.14s -> 12892.97s]  You lost your head twice.
[12892.97s -> 12895.90s]  And I really, really hurt my hand.
[12900.71s -> 12903.11s]  Do I need to use my right hand anymore?
[12903.11s -> 12907.29s]  Because it seriously hurts.
[12907.29s -> 12915.46s]  God, I got you loot.
[12915.46s -> 12917.86s]  Plus one to fucking damage hands.
[12917.86s -> 12920.10s]  I'm going to keep this one on, because I really did.
[12920.10s -> 12923.88s]  I may have sprained my wrist, because that was a hard punch.
[12923.88s -> 12926.41s]  Somebody fucking sell that on eBay.
[12926.41s -> 12934.34s]  All right, so now we have another game for you to play.
[12934.34s -> 12935.70s]  Oh, god.
[12935.70s -> 12936.62s]  Stay there, please.
[12936.62s -> 12937.94s]  Don't fall down.
[12937.94s -> 12943.21s]  The next game is a classic.
[12943.21s -> 12949.04s]  We're going to move on to the milk bottles, the milk bottle
[12949.04s -> 12949.64s]  game.
[12949.64s -> 12953.52s]  See you over there.
[12953.52s -> 12959.53s]  So this one, all you have to do, ladies and gentlemen,
[12959.53s -> 12965.99s]  you just have to knock the bottles down right in the middle.
[12965.99s -> 12968.99s]  If you can do that, you win.
[12968.99s -> 12971.46s]  Take them all down.
[12971.46s -> 12974.83s]  The controls are on the screen.
[12974.83s -> 12980.14s]  Can you do it?
[12980.14s -> 12981.14s]  Let me get back.
[12981.14s -> 12983.94s]  There it goes.
[12983.94s -> 12994.67s]  Right in the middle, right in the center.
[12994.67s -> 12997.40s]  Looks a lot easier than it is.
[12997.40s -> 13000.61s]  I can assure you.
[13000.61s -> 13005.12s]  It's aiming directly at me.
[13005.12s -> 13007.12s]  Right in the center.
[13007.12s -> 13009.21s]  You can do it.
[13009.21s -> 13013.05s]  You just have to take them down.
[13013.05s -> 13020.09s]  Probably shouldn't be standing there.
[13020.09s -> 13022.21s]  That's way too far.
[13022.21s -> 13030.15s]  Where are you going?
[13030.15s -> 13032.31s]  Are you going into the sky?
[13032.31s -> 13038.14s]  What the hell are you guys doing?
[13038.14s -> 13039.94s]  I got a net here.
[13039.94s -> 13042.02s]  I am in complete control.
[13042.02s -> 13044.00s]  No, there's a net here.
[13044.00s -> 13045.28s]  Funny, though.
[13045.28s -> 13047.00s]  Would have been funny.
[13047.00s -> 13048.04s]  No, I'm protective.
[13048.77s -> 13050.93s]  I just want to see your reaction when you hit it.
[13050.93s -> 13056.37s]  Because I want to see it fly back.
[13056.37s -> 13063.69s]  Get it in the middle.
[13063.69s -> 13078.36s]  Remember, only when it's green.
[13078.36s -> 13080.77s]  Come on.
[13080.77s -> 13084.72s]  No.
[13084.72s -> 13086.56s]  Pull it in tighter.
[13086.56s -> 13088.32s]  You've got to go much tighter than that.
[13088.32s -> 13091.01s]  Otherwise, it's never going to happen.
[13091.01s -> 13092.37s]  But the target's so much bigger.
[13092.37s -> 13095.93s]  OK, but the last one like this, the down the clown,
[13095.93s -> 13098.25s]  there was a small little section.
[13098.25s -> 13100.77s]  You can hit anywhere on these cans.
[13100.77s -> 13103.42s]  Just hit a can.
[13103.42s -> 13105.14s]  Anywhere.
[13105.14s -> 13108.59s]  Anywhere, right in the middle, preferably.
[13108.59s -> 13113.19s]  Should do it.
[13113.19s -> 13114.79s]  Look, right in my face.
[13114.79s -> 13118.36s]  Come on.
[13118.36s -> 13121.54s]  Right in the center.
[13121.54s -> 13122.94s]  That looks good.
[13122.94s -> 13127.44s]  That looks good.
[13127.44s -> 13131.36s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, too high.
[13131.36s -> 13134.20s]  Down, bring it down.
[13134.20s -> 13137.67s]  Oh, darn it.
[13137.67s -> 13140.24s]  Darn it.
[13140.24s -> 13141.56s]  Darn it.
[13141.56s -> 13143.08s]  I almost had it.
[13143.08s -> 13144.08s]  That was close.
[13144.08s -> 13145.60s]  Very close.
[13145.64s -> 13146.68s]  Very close.
[13146.68s -> 13149.15s]  Let me help you out here.
[13149.15s -> 13150.43s]  You did manage to get one, though.
[13150.43s -> 13151.83s]  That's good.
[13151.83s -> 13154.80s]  You did manage to get that one.
[13154.80s -> 13156.80s]  Let me help you get it back stacked up here.
[13156.80s -> 13159.11s]  Nice try.
[13159.11s -> 13160.76s]  Darn it.
[13160.76s -> 13162.41s]  That's unfortunate.
[13162.41s -> 13163.45s]  Too bad.
[13163.45s -> 13166.98s]  Try it again.
[13166.98s -> 13169.10s]  That was close.
[13169.10s -> 13177.99s]  Closer than I got last time I tried this.
[13177.99s -> 13179.07s]  You got the top one, though.
[13179.07s -> 13180.47s]  That's still good.
[13180.47s -> 13189.00s]  It's not bad.
[13189.00s -> 13191.08s]  Still doesn't count.
[13191.08s -> 13195.00s]  Still does not count, unfortunately.
[13195.96s -> 13198.84s]  Oh, I'm getting stuck.
[13198.84s -> 13201.04s]  I'll leave it off.
[13201.04s -> 13202.08s]  I'll leave that can off.
[13202.08s -> 13203.32s]  I mean, you just hit the top of it.
[13203.32s -> 13205.34s]  You got to get the whole thing.
[13205.34s -> 13209.16s]  You can't just hit it right at the top.
[13209.16s -> 13210.72s]  You've got a look.
[13210.72s -> 13211.68s]  Let me show you something here.
[13211.68s -> 13212.92s]  It's important.
[13212.92s -> 13216.76s]  Look at this.
[13216.76s -> 13219.72s]  So if you hit this thing here,
[13219.72s -> 13221.32s]  now people think this game is rigged, right?
[13221.32s -> 13223.24s]  Which, I mean, obviously you would think that
[13223.24s -> 13226.41s]  if you were a, you know,
[13226.41s -> 13228.97s]  your mind was a lot slower than mine was.
[13228.97s -> 13230.97s]  If you don't hit it directly in the center,
[13231.33s -> 13235.45s]  these things weigh like 45 pounds, right?
[13235.45s -> 13237.01s]  So this whole thing is like about 50 pounds.
[13237.01s -> 13242.32s]  So you got like four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32,
[13243.88s -> 13245.93s]  and then a higher one, like 40.
[13245.93s -> 13246.77s]  They're very heavy.
[13246.77s -> 13249.41s]  So you can't just hit one at the top,
[13249.41s -> 13251.29s]  and then you got to get it right in the center mass,
[13251.29s -> 13252.79s]  like right here.
[13252.79s -> 13255.73s]  If you don't do that, it's not going to fall over.
[13255.73s -> 13257.21s]  Somebody probably says, prove it, prove it,
[13257.21s -> 13258.13s]  but I want you to do it.
[13258.13s -> 13259.86s]  I don't want to do it.
[13259.86s -> 13260.70s]  You've dented them.
[13260.70s -> 13261.90s]  They're very heavy.
[13261.90s -> 13264.54s]  Look, see?
[13264.58s -> 13268.02s]  You see how fucking heavy this is?
[13268.02s -> 13272.71s]  You got to go from straight on directly in the middle.
[13272.71s -> 13274.39s]  Not going to work unless you do it that way.
[13274.39s -> 13281.33s]  I'll leave the top one off.
[13281.33s -> 13283.02s]  And you broke it.
[13283.02s -> 13285.46s]  Second time today.
[13285.46s -> 13287.99s]  You guys are going too hard.
[13287.99s -> 13293.03s]  You popped out the, you popped out the sphincter.
[13293.03s -> 13297.73s]  Just realizing live the word I just used.
[13297.73s -> 13299.41s]  But that's kind of what happened.
[13299.41s -> 13301.68s]  I saw it come up.
[13301.68s -> 13304.69s]  You popped out the sphincter.
[13304.69s -> 13305.97s]  That's what, I think that's actually,
[13305.97s -> 13309.25s]  that's the technical term for the whole thing.
[13309.29s -> 13312.10s]  Maybe, I'm not sure.
[13312.10s -> 13314.04s]  Hey, want to see this?
[13314.04s -> 13321.83s]  How about this?
[13321.83s -> 13323.39s]  I, can I not do that, really?
[13326.11s -> 13334.35s]  Let's kill some time.
[13334.35s -> 13336.47s]  How the fuck do people learn how to do this?
[13336.47s -> 13338.62s]  I don't know.
[13338.62s -> 13343.09s]  Can I do three?
[13343.09s -> 13345.25s]  No, no, not a chance in hell.
[13345.25s -> 13355.20s]  I'll try to do three.
[13355.20s -> 13356.56s]  From my understanding, you have to do,
[13356.56s -> 13360.85s]  no, that's not going to happen.
[13360.85s -> 13362.81s]  Oh wait, I put you guys to chat.
[13362.81s -> 13366.39s]  What are they saying?
[13366.39s -> 13367.71s]  What are they saying right now?
[13367.71s -> 13369.27s]  I wonder.
[13369.27s -> 13372.08s]  I wonder what things they're screaming at me.
[13372.08s -> 13374.32s]  Jeremy, what the fuck is happening?
[13374.32s -> 13376.64s]  Why can't we play the damn game?
[13376.64s -> 13377.60s]  And I'll just very quickly,
[13377.60s -> 13379.72s]  there's another balloon popped off camera.
[13379.72s -> 13381.72s]  We've had like a balloon pop like every 15 seconds.
[13381.72s -> 13385.15s]  I'm not sure if you can fix it on the microphones or not.
[13385.15s -> 13387.95s]  Jeremy, I want to throw the ball at the can.
[13387.95s -> 13388.79s]  And I know you do.
[13388.79s -> 13389.67s]  Trust me, I do too.
[13391.19s -> 13392.03s]  Here's me.
[13392.03s -> 13393.71s]  Look, those of you that say that I'm bald,
[13393.71s -> 13395.63s]  if you want to take a look at the,
[13395.63s -> 13396.59s]  sure, take a look.
[13397.99s -> 13399.55s]  That's as far back as it goes.
[13401.34s -> 13402.66s]  You're getting real Jeremy Yelbertson.
[13402.66s -> 13410.01s]  There's no substitute right now.
[13410.01s -> 13414.15s]  If it wasn't so windy, oh well.
[13414.15s -> 13415.43s]  What are you going to do?
[13415.43s -> 13416.27s]  So why are you getting,
[13416.27s -> 13419.38s]  I can see you getting that close.
[13419.38s -> 13420.38s]  Pull it back.
[13420.38s -> 13422.24s]  Get the whole image.
[13422.24s -> 13428.36s]  Let me go like this.
[13428.36s -> 13432.42s]  We're trying to fix it.
[13432.42s -> 13435.34s]  This robot has seen hell.
[13435.34s -> 13437.70s]  It's gotten a ton of inputs.
[13437.70s -> 13439.78s]  The server crashed like three times,
[13439.78s -> 13441.38s]  but it still worked.
[13441.38s -> 13443.38s]  And it still works very well.
[13443.38s -> 13446.90s]  This thing is a modern marvel of engineering.
[13446.90s -> 13449.94s]  It's just taking thousands of inputs at the same exact time.
[13449.94s -> 13451.70s]  So one of the things gets busted,
[13451.70s -> 13453.74s]  they fix it, and we keep going.
[13453.74s -> 13454.90s]  Not a problem.
[13454.90s -> 13459.24s]  And I think, ladies and gentlemen,
[13459.24s -> 13460.36s]  I think we're going to be,
[13460.36s -> 13474.64s]  we are going to be close soon.
[13474.64s -> 13483.37s]  Let's go.
[13483.37s -> 13484.65s]  Oh shit.
[13484.65s -> 13485.61s]  I hear it moving.
[13490.13s -> 13492.76s]  I'm getting the fuck out of the way.
[13492.76s -> 13494.08s]  When I hear that noise, it's just like,
[13494.08s -> 13500.70s]  all right, time to get, I'm trying to move.
[13500.70s -> 13515.39s]  Please don't hit me.
[13515.39s -> 13518.96s]  Boom.
[13518.96s -> 13521.13s]  Knock it down.
[13521.13s -> 13522.45s]  You had plenty of downtime there.
[13522.45s -> 13525.37s]  You had like at least a two minute, three minute downtime.
[13525.37s -> 13527.23s]  Maybe five minutes.
[13527.23s -> 13528.75s]  Knock it down.
[13528.75s -> 13530.35s]  Get those bottles.
[13530.35s -> 13533.87s]  Get those 45 pound cans.
[13533.87s -> 13536.27s]  Wind's picking up.
[13536.27s -> 13547.50s]  Can you compensate for the wind, I wonder.
[13547.50s -> 13548.34s]  Oh.
[13548.34s -> 13549.18s]  Oh.
[13564.12s -> 13566.90s]  You can see them.
[13566.90s -> 13571.66s]  Oh, those 45, 45 pound cans are really,
[13572.80s -> 13575.67s]  really taking a beating.
[13575.67s -> 13578.96s]  As you can very reliably tell.
[13578.96s -> 13580.56s]  I don't think you guys are capable
[13580.56s -> 13582.99s]  of knocking the cans down.
[13582.99s -> 13595.57s]  It's very hard.
[13595.57s -> 13597.15s]  Three seconds.
[13597.15s -> 13610.01s]  Can you do it?
[13610.01s -> 13612.28s]  Look at this thing.
[13612.28s -> 13613.64s]  Oh, too bad.
[13613.64s -> 13616.40s]  You guys don't get the Wailord prize.
[13616.40s -> 13617.24s]  Oh shit, I'm stuck.
[13617.24s -> 13618.56s]  It's a spider web.
[13618.56s -> 13626.96s]  Oh, they're going to kill me.
[13626.96s -> 13629.52s]  Just like the real thing.
[13629.52s -> 13632.28s]  You can't fucking do it.
[13632.28s -> 13633.52s]  I win.
[13634.79s -> 13639.52s]  I win.
[13639.52s -> 13641.20s]  Don't ever play this game at the carnival
[13641.20s -> 13643.24s]  because it's impossible.
[13643.24s -> 13644.96s]  You cannot win this game.
[13644.96s -> 13646.80s]  It's not completable.
[13646.80s -> 13648.36s]  It isn't.
[13648.36s -> 13650.83s]  They weigh them down.
[13650.83s -> 13652.67s]  We don't do that here.
[13652.67s -> 13653.51s]  Absolutely not.
[13670.56s -> 13672.99s]  Does that technically count as a win?
[13687.11s -> 13689.34s]  That doesn't count.
[13689.34s -> 13691.30s]  I don't know if that's a count or not.
[13691.30s -> 13692.14s]  Should it be?
[13696.66s -> 13697.50s]  All right.
[13697.50s -> 13698.50s]  No, okay.
[13698.50s -> 13699.34s]  That counts.
[13699.34s -> 13701.06s]  That counts.
[13701.06s -> 13701.90s]  That's a count.
[13707.91s -> 13709.92s]  What the fuck?
[13714.33s -> 13717.55s]  Hey, welcome to the carnival.
[13717.55s -> 13719.51s]  Well, even when you rig the game,
[13719.51s -> 13721.15s]  it don't matter because
[13724.36s -> 13725.36s]  they'll find a way.
[13729.08s -> 13729.92s]  All right.
[13729.92s -> 13735.87s]  So we are moving towards another game.
[13735.87s -> 13737.31s]  But before we do,
[13737.31s -> 13742.31s]  we are going to complete this whole arc here.
[13742.75s -> 13745.27s]  We're going to go back to,
[13745.27s -> 13746.79s]  who do you think?
[13746.79s -> 13748.64s]  Where are we going?
[13748.64s -> 13751.96s]  I want to see it spammed in chat before I go anywhere.
[13751.96s -> 13753.24s]  Who's coming back out here?
[13754.65s -> 13757.40s]  What do you think?
[13757.40s -> 13759.44s]  Dog?
[13759.44s -> 13760.28s]  Is it a cat?
[13760.28s -> 13762.00s]  No.
[13762.00s -> 13765.56s]  Who could possibly be coming out onto the main stage
[13765.56s -> 13768.56s]  to perform for you guys?
[13768.56s -> 13773.87s]  That's fucking awesome.
[13773.87s -> 13779.62s]  So let's move it over once again
[13779.62s -> 13784.32s]  to Cuddles and Poli-Polite.
[13784.32s -> 13814.36s]  I'm taking him out.
[13814.36s -> 13815.20s]  I'm taking him out.
[13815.20s -> 13833.37s]  Whoa!
[13833.37s -> 13836.05s]  We'll play a game.
[13836.05s -> 13836.89s]  I promise.
[13836.89s -> 13849.49s]  We'll play a game.
[13849.49s -> 13851.15s]  We'll play a game.
[13851.15s -> 13856.93s]  And we'll play a game, okay?
[13856.93s -> 13860.87s]  Any time now.
[13860.87s -> 13861.71s]  Okay.
[13861.71s -> 13862.55s]  I'm ready to play.
[13862.55s -> 13863.76s]  All right.
[13863.76s -> 13864.60s]  Stop the game.
[13864.60s -> 13865.44s]  I'm ready to play a game.
[13865.44s -> 13866.28s]  All right.
[13866.28s -> 13873.29s]  Now.
[13873.29s -> 13874.13s]  All right.
[13874.13s -> 13874.95s]  Hold the bag up like this.
[13874.95s -> 13875.79s]  You know what?
[13875.79s -> 13889.20s]  All the colors of all the ones.
[13889.20s -> 13890.12s]  What you're going to have to do
[13890.12s -> 13897.64s]  is I'm going to hold the bag up here just like this.
[13897.64s -> 13898.72s]  There it is.
[13898.72s -> 13899.56s]  Nevermind.
[13899.64s -> 13900.48s]  Can I look?
[13908.16s -> 13910.01s]  Let it go.
[13910.01s -> 13911.61s]  I'm going to hold the bag up just like this.
[13911.61s -> 13913.69s]  I'm going to reach right in there just like this
[13913.69s -> 13915.17s]  and I'm going to get a ball.
[13915.17s -> 13918.19s]  I've got one in my hand.
[13918.19s -> 13919.03s]  Are you ready?
[13919.03s -> 13924.11s]  One, two, three.
[13924.11s -> 13925.07s]  So smart.
[13925.07s -> 13925.91s]  I'm so smart.
[13925.91s -> 13926.75s]  Hey.
[13926.75s -> 13928.51s]  That was pretty smart.
[13939.80s -> 13942.22s]  Careful.
[13942.22s -> 13943.34s]  I saw what that was.
[13943.34s -> 13944.18s]  Put it back in there.
[13944.18s -> 13945.62s]  Okay.
[13945.62s -> 13949.28s]  Pick out a ball.
[13949.28s -> 13950.12s]  All right.
[13950.12s -> 13950.94s]  You got a ball.
[13950.94s -> 13951.78s]  I got a ball.
[13951.78s -> 13952.62s]  I got one.
[13952.62s -> 13953.44s]  So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold the bag up
[13953.44s -> 13954.28s]  just like this.
[13954.28s -> 13956.36s]  And I'm going to reach right inside there
[13956.36s -> 13957.52s]  and I'm going to get a ball.
[13957.52s -> 13958.36s]  All right.
[13958.36s -> 13959.18s]  Turn around.
[13959.18s -> 13961.54s]  So you can't see.
[13961.54s -> 13963.38s]  I'm ready.
[13963.38s -> 13964.20s]  You ready?
[13964.20s -> 13965.04s]  One, two, three.
[13965.04s -> 13968.86s]  See, I told you I was smart.
[13970.00s -> 13970.84s]  Oh yeah.
[13970.84s -> 13971.76s]  You did.
[13971.76s -> 13972.60s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13972.60s -> 13973.42s]  So all right.
[13973.42s -> 13974.26s]  Put it down inside of there.
[13974.26s -> 13975.10s]  Okay.
[13975.10s -> 13975.92s]  Okay.
[13975.92s -> 13977.45s]  One more time.
[13977.45s -> 13980.52s]  One more.
[13980.52s -> 13981.34s]  Hold my bag.
[13981.34s -> 13987.72s]  Hey, come on.
[13987.72s -> 13989.44s]  You took a ball.
[13989.44s -> 13992.75s]  Now I'm going to take a ball.
[13992.75s -> 13994.75s]  I got my ball.
[13994.75s -> 13995.71s]  You got your ball?
[13995.71s -> 13996.55s]  Yeah.
[13996.55s -> 13997.39s]  I got my ball.
[13998.03s -> 13999.43s]  You ready to show your ball?
[13999.43s -> 14000.27s]  Yeah.
[14000.27s -> 14001.35s]  I'm ready to show mine.
[14005.28s -> 14006.12s]  Oh boy.
[14009.94s -> 14012.42s]  I can't get over that that I'm so smart.
[14012.42s -> 14014.70s]  I can't believe that I did that.
[14014.70s -> 14016.54s]  Oh boy, that's good.
[14016.54s -> 14018.90s]  Now I'll show you something else if you'd be alive.
[14018.90s -> 14019.74s]  Okay.
[14019.74s -> 14020.56s]  All right.
[14020.56s -> 14021.40s]  Show me.
[14021.40s -> 14022.24s]  All right.
[14022.24s -> 14023.06s]  I want to see.
[14023.06s -> 14023.90s]  I'm sure.
[14023.90s -> 14025.02s]  You need to turn this right here.
[14025.02s -> 14027.50s]  See, these are my little doggies.
[14027.50s -> 14028.34s]  Yeah.
[14028.34s -> 14030.58s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[14030.58s -> 14032.62s]  If you can count, I'm glad of that.
[14032.62s -> 14036.06s]  Now what I want you to do is I'm going to make a prediction.
[14036.06s -> 14038.14s]  When I make this prediction,
[14038.14s -> 14041.38s]  I know which ducky you're going to choose.
[14041.38s -> 14042.58s]  You think you do.
[14042.58s -> 14043.42s]  Yes, I do.
[14043.42s -> 14045.82s]  So I'm going to take my prediction.
[14045.82s -> 14047.30s]  There's my prediction.
[14047.30s -> 14049.54s]  And I'm going to put it right down there inside the box.
[14049.54s -> 14050.38s]  Okay.
[14050.38s -> 14051.20s]  All right.
[14051.20s -> 14052.04s]  I'm going to pick.
[14052.04s -> 14054.40s]  Yes, you can do that.
[14054.40s -> 14061.84s]  Come on.
[14061.84s -> 14062.68s]  The ducky.
[14064.40s -> 14069.08s]  No, you have to come over here and pick up the ducky.
[14069.12s -> 14074.73s]  Which ducky you're going to pick up?
[14074.73s -> 14076.46s]  Pick it up that way.
[14076.46s -> 14077.30s]  So you pick it up.
[14077.30s -> 14082.51s]  Now, would you look at the ducky's bottom?
[14082.51s -> 14084.15s]  What's on the ducky's bottom, please?
[14084.15s -> 14085.15s]  It's a number.
[14085.15s -> 14086.11s]  Yeah, there's a number.
[14086.11s -> 14087.31s]  And what's that number?
[14091.13s -> 14092.13s]  They don't care.
[14092.13s -> 14093.49s]  I care.
[14093.49s -> 14096.17s]  See, we got one, two, three, four, five, six.
[14096.17s -> 14097.01s]  But look at that.
[14097.01s -> 14098.09s]  Number three is missing.
[14098.09s -> 14100.65s]  You got a number three on your bottom of your ducky?
[14105.82s -> 14107.18s]  Because I need a prediction.
[14107.18s -> 14108.02s]  I do.
[14108.02s -> 14109.66s]  Where's my prediction?
[14109.82s -> 14111.46s]  Yeah, I got a prediction.
[14111.46s -> 14113.38s]  Hey, it says right here.
[14117.05s -> 14118.55s]  It's a three.
[14118.55s -> 14119.87s]  Hey, it says a three.
[14119.87s -> 14120.71s]  What's it say?
[14120.71s -> 14123.43s]  It says, this was the ducky that would be wearing
[14123.43s -> 14125.99s]  the pink sweater with the pink and blue hat.
[14131.12s -> 14131.96s]  I got it.
[14131.96s -> 14133.74s]  Yeah.
[14133.74s -> 14136.31s]  And if you hadn't found it, you know what?
[14136.31s -> 14138.23s]  I was going to stick a $20 bill in there
[14138.23s -> 14139.91s]  just to get you going.
[14139.91s -> 14142.39s]  But you see, you were just, no,
[14142.39s -> 14145.19s]  you were just jumping up and down and you made me forget.
[14145.19s -> 14146.99s]  So yeah, now forget it.
[14146.99s -> 14147.83s]  Forget it.
[14149.94s -> 14155.32s]  Yeah, very much.
[14155.32s -> 14157.12s]  Well, take him on my way.
[14157.12s -> 14159.80s]  I can't tell you how smart I am now.
[14159.80s -> 14160.64s]  Do you want to play the ball?
[14160.64s -> 14161.96s]  Do you want to play the ball?
[14161.96s -> 14163.20s]  I'm the polite one.
[14163.20s -> 14164.04s]  I'm the polite one.
[14164.04s -> 14164.88s]  I like to play ball.
[14164.88s -> 14165.72s]  Let's go.
[14184.98s -> 14204.25s]  That was fun, right?
[14204.25s -> 14206.77s]  Hey, well, can you believe it?
[14206.77s -> 14208.67s]  Thank you again.
[14208.67s -> 14210.19s]  Thank you.
[14210.19s -> 14211.57s]  Thank you.
[14211.57s -> 14214.17s]  We have a very special, special treat for you here.
[14214.17s -> 14216.37s]  This is the final game of the evening.
[14216.37s -> 14217.93s]  If you were curious.
[14217.93s -> 14218.77s]  Watch that.
[14218.77s -> 14219.81s]  Watch that final game.
[14219.81s -> 14220.65s]  Final game.
[14220.65s -> 14222.81s]  The final game is going to be the crane.
[14222.81s -> 14223.93s]  We have a crane here.
[14226.07s -> 14227.99s]  We have a crane here.
[14227.99s -> 14232.19s]  And the crane is going to be controlled
[14232.19s -> 14236.51s]  by you guys in chat.
[14236.51s -> 14239.87s]  And I hope you can get prizes.
[14239.87s -> 14242.99s]  There are various prizes in here for you to collect.
[14242.99s -> 14244.71s]  You are in control of the game.
[14244.71s -> 14246.43s]  It is you.
[14246.43s -> 14247.51s]  You got the claw.
[14247.51s -> 14248.43s]  You've got the button.
[14248.87s -> 14249.71s]  You've got the timer.
[14249.71s -> 14252.23s]  Try to grab whatever prizes you possibly can
[14252.23s -> 14253.99s]  in the time limit.
[14253.99s -> 14255.27s]  This is the last game of the evening.
[14255.27s -> 14258.05s]  But that's not true.
[14258.05s -> 14259.21s]  I'm a liar.
[14259.21s -> 14260.37s]  I'm a pretty bad liar.
[14260.37s -> 14262.25s]  So enjoy the crane game.
[14262.25s -> 14263.09s]  Have fun with it.
[14263.09s -> 14264.65s]  Try to get a good prize.
[14264.65s -> 14275.67s]  I will see you guys in a moment.
[14275.67s -> 14279.20s]  Let's see if we can get something.
[14279.20s -> 14280.48s]  Camera back.
[14280.48s -> 14281.32s]  Crane back.
[14281.32s -> 14282.60s]  Crane back.
[14282.60s -> 14285.08s]  Crane toward, crane left, crane right.
[14285.08s -> 14287.48s]  Got a bunch of various prizes in here that look good.
[14287.48s -> 14288.64s]  Did you just get one?
[14289.24s -> 14291.32s]  No, you didn't really just get one right off the bat, did you?
[14291.32s -> 14292.16s]  Did you get a panda right?
[14292.16s -> 14293.36s]  No, you didn't.
[14293.36s -> 14296.56s]  They didn't just really get it right off the bat.
[14296.56s -> 14297.64s]  No, they didn't.
[14297.64s -> 14304.80s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[14304.80s -> 14305.64s]  They won.
[14305.64s -> 14306.46s]  The first try.
[14306.46s -> 14307.30s]  They got it first try.
[14307.30s -> 14308.76s]  You did it first try.
[14308.76s -> 14310.27s]  Really?
[14310.27s -> 14311.27s]  Well, do it again.
[14312.19s -> 14313.03s]  Okay.
[14314.39s -> 14315.23s]  Wait, is it a pant?
[14315.23s -> 14316.07s]  No, it's a cat.
[14320.88s -> 14322.28s]  Wait, wait, what?
[14322.28s -> 14323.12s]  Hold on.
[14324.49s -> 14327.32s]  There was a prize in here.
[14327.32s -> 14331.11s]  What are you going for, the goat?
[14332.07s -> 14334.64s]  I picked up the wrong prize.
[14334.64s -> 14335.76s]  Oh!
[14335.76s -> 14338.06s]  No, you did it again.
[14338.06s -> 14342.81s]  You did it, you got it again.
[14342.81s -> 14343.93s]  Holy shit.
[14344.77s -> 14345.61s]  Wow.
[14350.09s -> 14353.07s]  There are a bunch, you didn't get this.
[14354.09s -> 14355.05s]  Where's the panda?
[14357.39s -> 14359.94s]  What the fuck is this?
[14359.94s -> 14361.38s]  Oh, there it is.
[14361.38s -> 14363.36s]  You guys are good at this shit, apparently.
[14363.36s -> 14372.20s]  Nice work.
[14372.20s -> 14378.21s]  Going for another goat?
[14378.21s -> 14380.17s]  You guys aren't gonna be four for four.
[14382.37s -> 14384.15s]  Is this too easy?
[14384.15s -> 14385.35s]  No, nothing.
[14385.35s -> 14386.31s]  Sorry.
[14386.31s -> 14387.35s]  Not that time.
[14389.20s -> 14390.04s]  Not that time.
[14393.68s -> 14395.28s]  You can see me.
[14395.28s -> 14402.27s]  You can see, oh, look at you.
[14402.27s -> 14407.72s]  There are some rare prizes in here, as there always are.
[14407.72s -> 14409.64s]  You got some orange and blue stuff.
[14409.64s -> 14412.32s]  I think that's a Fortnite pinata.
[14412.32s -> 14415.12s]  I know a lot of you guys like that game.
[14415.12s -> 14416.72s]  I mean, I would be going for the Fortnite pinata
[14416.72s -> 14419.47s]  on the right side.
[14419.47s -> 14420.83s]  It's dropping, where's it going?
[14420.83s -> 14423.48s]  No, it's gonna get caught.
[14424.24s -> 14426.52s]  No, it didn't.
[14426.52s -> 14435.28s]  Do you guys like Fortnite?
[14435.28s -> 14440.93s]  Oh, I was trying to get it, nevermind.
[14440.93s -> 14442.69s]  No, you didn't get it, unfortunately.
[14442.69s -> 14444.09s]  But you guys have a few prizes here.
[14444.09s -> 14446.73s]  You got a wheel, a cat, a panda, a goat.
[14447.61s -> 14451.12s]  I'm gonna put these down.
[14451.12s -> 14453.00s]  Only do the commands when it's green.
[14460.13s -> 14463.80s]  Zero.
[14463.80s -> 14468.57s]  Oh, they're going for Fortnite.
[14468.57s -> 14473.87s]  Are they gonna get in there?
[14473.87s -> 14476.60s]  Oh shit.
[14476.60s -> 14480.74s]  Another goat.
[14480.74s -> 14481.58s]  Really?
[14482.58s -> 14491.68s]  Winner.
[14491.68s -> 14493.40s]  I'm keeping all these, by the way.
[14497.07s -> 14498.51s]  Goated.
[14498.51s -> 14501.52s]  The controls are inverted.
[14501.52s -> 14507.41s]  Good, extra hard.
[14507.41s -> 14511.33s]  Remember, toward is toward the screen.
[14511.33s -> 14516.98s]  Back is back towards the mirror.
[14516.98s -> 14519.90s]  Thank you Invader Lurr for the five community subs.
[14519.90s -> 14520.90s]  Appreciate that.
[14520.90s -> 14521.86s]  You almost got something there.
[14521.86s -> 14522.70s]  What are those?
[14524.28s -> 14527.35s]  Close.
[14527.35s -> 14529.64s]  Those are socks.
[14529.64s -> 14532.36s]  Some type of video game that has an RPG.
[14533.16s -> 14535.00s]  From the video game Nintendo.
[14539.64s -> 14544.28s]  That's a Nintendo sock game.
[14544.28s -> 14545.20s]  It's all right, though.
[14545.20s -> 14547.97s]  I don't know if you'll get it or not.
[14547.97s -> 14550.20s]  I don't know if it's worth it.
[14550.20s -> 14553.67s]  Going for Fortnite.
[14553.67s -> 14559.36s]  Drop it.
[14559.36s -> 14562.51s]  Oh, is it gonna happen?
[14567.34s -> 14572.35s]  People are saying the controls are inverted.
[14572.35s -> 14576.74s]  Why inverted?
[14576.74s -> 14580.18s]  Yeah, guys, remember, S is towards the screen.
[14580.18s -> 14584.86s]  W is back towards the back of the machine.
[14584.86s -> 14590.84s]  When you press S, it's coming forward, like toward you.
[14590.84s -> 14594.63s]  A should be left, D should be right.
[14594.63s -> 14596.79s]  And thank you 8BitZig for the five community subs.
[14596.79s -> 14601.08s]  Appreciate that.
[14601.08s -> 14603.36s]  I love how you guys like the pretend Fortnite thing
[14603.36s -> 14604.68s]  rather than the Pikachu socks
[14604.68s -> 14608.33s]  that I've been lying about for a year and a half.
[14608.33s -> 14609.29s]  It's kind of surprising to me.
[14609.29s -> 14610.25s]  I said the word Fortnite.
[14610.25s -> 14611.29s]  Really, another goat.
[14614.05s -> 14614.89s]  Okay.
[14623.03s -> 14626.74s]  They're saying A and D is inverted.
[14626.74s -> 14629.19s]  Is A and D inverted?
[14629.19s -> 14630.91s]  It shouldn't be.
[14630.91s -> 14633.19s]  There's no way to change that.
[14633.19s -> 14636.11s]  D is left, A is right, apparently.
[14641.86s -> 14645.47s]  A for Pikachu.
[14645.47s -> 14647.07s]  It's not inverted, I'm being lied to.
[14647.07s -> 14652.92s]  Okay, well, that's fine.
[14656.27s -> 14657.55s]  What's that?
[14657.55s -> 14666.04s]  Oh, you've got Jake from Adventure Time.
[14666.04s -> 14669.00s]  Another balloon just popped.
[14669.00s -> 14669.84s]  Nice work.
[14669.84s -> 14674.33s]  This is the best, you guys are, seriously.
[14674.33s -> 14676.34s]  Oh, there's the panda.
[14676.34s -> 14679.92s]  Take a look at this shit.
[14679.92s -> 14681.20s]  That's the first thing you won.
[14681.20s -> 14686.20s]  I know I'm in the way, but whatever, you got two goats.
[14686.20s -> 14691.79s]  Wait, what happened to the thing you just won?
[14691.79s -> 14693.27s]  It's not even in here.
[14693.27s -> 14695.23s]  Where the fuck is it?
[14695.23s -> 14697.72s]  I don't see it in here.
[14697.72s -> 14699.12s]  Uh-oh.
[14699.12s -> 14700.79s]  No!
[14700.79s -> 14704.15s]  Are you gonna get it?
[14704.15s -> 14704.99s]  Oh!
[14706.98s -> 14710.37s]  They got it!
[14710.37s -> 14711.45s]  No, drop it!
[14711.45s -> 14714.69s]  Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop!
[14714.69s -> 14715.53s]  Oh!
[14722.71s -> 14724.72s]  You did it!
[14724.72s -> 14727.12s]  Congratulations.
[14727.12s -> 14729.24s]  I'll put them on.
[14729.24s -> 14730.96s]  You got the Pikachu socks.
[14730.96s -> 14732.00s]  Congratulations, guys.
[14732.00s -> 14733.60s]  Excellent work.
[14733.60s -> 14736.97s]  Nice job.
[14736.97s -> 14737.81s]  I can't.
[14737.81s -> 14741.25s]  I have to show them.
[14742.55s -> 14745.36s]  Get the Fortnite thing.
[14745.36s -> 14746.20s]  Come on!
[14754.37s -> 14758.12s]  Get the Fortnite goat, whatever that video game is.
[14758.12s -> 14760.52s]  No, nice try.
[14760.52s -> 14761.64s]  Get more goats.
[14767.04s -> 14769.64s]  Turns out out of the four plus hours we've been doing this,
[14769.64s -> 14771.72s]  you guys have been better at the crayon game
[14771.72s -> 14773.80s]  than anything else and you got the Pikachu socks.
[14773.80s -> 14775.08s]  Congratulations.
[14775.08s -> 14777.05s]  Nice work.
[14777.05s -> 14781.61s]  But can you get the not licensed bottom of the shelf
[14781.61s -> 14784.69s]  at the grocery store cereal non-branded
[14784.69s -> 14786.65s]  Captain Crunch character that is Fortnite?
[14786.65s -> 14787.49s]  Can you get it?
[14787.49s -> 14790.75s]  I wonder.
[14790.75s -> 14792.19s]  Can you get the off-brand Fortnite?
[14792.19s -> 14793.07s]  This is not Fortnite.
[14793.07s -> 14793.91s]  Don't sue me.
[14794.88s -> 14795.72s]  Thing.
[14795.72s -> 14798.64s]  I don't know.
[14798.64s -> 14799.96s]  I don't know.
[14800.04s -> 14800.88s]  Can they get it?
[14806.54s -> 14810.02s]  The suspense is killing me.
[14810.02s -> 14811.14s]  Another goat.
[14813.96s -> 14816.40s]  You got to get the orange Fortnite character.
[14822.04s -> 14822.96s]  Just wait a second.
[14822.96s -> 14838.34s]  Hold on.
[14838.34s -> 14841.00s]  Get Fortnite.
[14841.00s -> 14843.95s]  I love that game.
[14843.95s -> 14850.82s]  I love building and jumping and firing my shotgun.
[14850.82s -> 14852.90s]  Is this the one?
[14852.90s -> 14854.62s]  No, it's another goat.
[14859.46s -> 14860.30s]  No way.
[14863.16s -> 14864.00s]  No.
[14865.24s -> 14867.64s]  No.
[14867.64s -> 14869.86s]  No.
[14869.86s -> 14872.53s]  Remember, three goats get you a dab.
[14872.53s -> 14873.53s]  Oh, five.
[14873.53s -> 14874.89s]  Sorry.
[14874.89s -> 14876.05s]  We already have three.
[14884.36s -> 14890.51s]  Oh, this is fucking, this is so fun.
[14890.51s -> 14892.36s]  Come on.
[14892.36s -> 14896.54s]  Get a good prize.
[14896.54s -> 14903.16s]  What are you really, you guys are going for the goats.
[14903.16s -> 14906.86s]  Are you going to get every goat that's in here?
[14906.86s -> 14908.26s]  No, sorry.
[14909.18s -> 14914.55s]  Goat spotted is one of the things we're seeing here.
[14914.55s -> 14916.64s]  Sorry.
[14916.64s -> 14919.24s]  Now, when less are available to grab,
[14919.24s -> 14920.40s]  they get harder to get.
[14924.86s -> 14925.70s]  What do you mean rigged?
[14925.70s -> 14926.90s]  It's not rigged.
[14926.90s -> 14929.46s]  You guys, you got like seven prizes.
[14929.46s -> 14932.10s]  How is this rigged?
[14932.10s -> 14933.26s]  Oh, it's rigged.
[14933.26s -> 14940.52s]  You pulled out like eight things.
[14940.52s -> 14941.36s]  All right, come on.
[14941.36s -> 14942.84s]  Let's see it.
[14942.84s -> 14948.02s]  Get the off-brand cereal Fortnite.
[14948.02s -> 14951.77s]  No, you went for the goat.
[14951.77s -> 14952.98s]  You didn't.
[14956.12s -> 14958.16s]  Okay, another one.
[14958.16s -> 14959.68s]  Good job.
[14959.68s -> 14960.52s]  It's going to drop.
[14960.52s -> 14961.36s]  It's going to drop.
[14961.36s -> 14962.65s]  It's going to drop.
[14962.65s -> 14963.49s]  Shit.
[14966.63s -> 14967.47s]  All right, we got it.
[14967.47s -> 14968.87s]  Here we go.
[14968.87s -> 14969.71s]  There you go.
[14969.71s -> 14970.55s]  You won it.
[14970.55s -> 14971.39s]  Nice job.
[14971.39s -> 14973.63s]  And there's Jake from, Finn and Jake,
[14973.63s -> 14975.43s]  fucking throw swords at monsters,
[14975.43s -> 14981.14s]  whatever that show is called.
[14981.14s -> 14982.98s]  Better than anything else today.
[14982.98s -> 14985.58s]  Funnily enough,
[14985.58s -> 14989.94s]  chat is very good at grabbing stuff out of a box.
[14989.98s -> 14991.78s]  Not so good at firing a ball
[14992.78s -> 14996.42s]  or flipping a ball into a hole.
[14996.42s -> 15001.76s]  But very, very good at putting a crane down.
[15001.76s -> 15003.22s]  Did they get it?
[15003.22s -> 15007.32s]  Oh, no.
[15007.32s -> 15009.00s]  Almost.
[15009.00s -> 15013.86s]  We had a chance.
[15013.86s -> 15015.18s]  We're not, guys, I'm telling you right now,
[15015.18s -> 15019.40s]  I'm not stopping this till you get me a Fortnite.
[15019.40s -> 15022.08s]  We're not moving on till I get a Fortnite.
[15022.08s -> 15024.92s]  I got to stop saying that before I get in trouble.
[15024.92s -> 15031.15s]  A neon orange Jolly Rancher.
[15031.15s -> 15032.31s]  But that's a brand too.
[15032.31s -> 15034.09s]  I can't say that.
[15034.09s -> 15037.63s]  What's a non-branded orange thing?
[15037.63s -> 15039.47s]  Orange.
[15039.47s -> 15040.95s]  It's just orange, okay.
[15040.95s -> 15042.83s]  An orange dog.
[15042.83s -> 15044.83s]  I can just say that, apparently.
[15046.15s -> 15048.58s]  What do you got?
[15048.58s -> 15051.51s]  Pull it up.
[15051.51s -> 15053.15s]  Oh, they got another cat.
[15055.44s -> 15057.04s]  You guys are pretty good at this.
[15061.43s -> 15063.00s]  Cute.
[15063.00s -> 15066.64s]  By the way, all these are going to my office.
[15066.64s -> 15068.48s]  There you go.
[15068.48s -> 15071.14s]  Nice job, nice work.
[15071.14s -> 15074.51s]  All these are going up in my office.
[15074.51s -> 15078.47s]  Whatever you guys pull out of here, anything.
[15078.47s -> 15080.87s]  It's going to be a goat office at this point.
[15084.71s -> 15085.91s]  There's like a zebra in the back.
[15085.91s -> 15087.88s]  You haven't gone for the zebra?
[15087.88s -> 15094.33s]  Come on.
[15094.33s -> 15096.57s]  They want it, but I don't know if they're going to get it.
[15096.57s -> 15099.21s]  They want it, but they're not going to get it.
[15099.21s -> 15101.25s]  Is that a double prize?
[15101.25s -> 15103.61s]  That's a PogChamp right there.
[15103.61s -> 15105.41s]  That's a Garfield.
[15105.41s -> 15107.89s]  That's an orange Garfield and a unicorn.
[15107.89s -> 15109.45s]  I think they got a double prize.
[15109.45s -> 15110.69s]  Are they going to do it?
[15110.69s -> 15114.58s]  Oh, you got to be kidding me.
[15114.58s -> 15116.78s]  You got the orange fucking Fortnite Garfield
[15116.78s -> 15119.34s]  and you got the unicorn.
[15119.34s -> 15120.78s]  Unbelievable.
[15120.78s -> 15124.88s]  That's a double.
[15124.88s -> 15133.63s]  That deserves a dab.
[15133.63s -> 15134.47s]  I give it to you.
[15134.47s -> 15136.27s]  You get one.
[15136.27s -> 15142.70s]  What's all over me?
[15142.70s -> 15144.38s]  Fortnite Garfield.
[15150.16s -> 15151.24s]  Don't worry, guys.
[15151.24s -> 15153.64s]  That fucking dumb game will add Garfield probably next.
[15153.64s -> 15156.05s]  You got to double twice.
[15156.65s -> 15159.42s]  That's a quadruple.
[15159.42s -> 15164.36s]  Holy shit.
[15164.36s -> 15168.26s]  No way.
[15168.26s -> 15169.10s]  Wow.
[15169.10s -> 15171.70s]  You got two shitty dumb, that game sucks,
[15171.70s -> 15181.08s]  Fortnite characters.
[15181.08s -> 15182.24s]  That's twice in a row.
[15182.24s -> 15187.55s]  Are you kidding me?
[15187.55s -> 15189.39s]  That's two dabs.
[15189.39s -> 15190.23s]  No, you get one.
[15190.23s -> 15191.07s]  You only get one.
[15191.07s -> 15191.91s]  I'm not doing another one.
[15191.91s -> 15195.95s]  Stop saying Fortnite.
[15195.95s -> 15198.25s]  Say whatever I want.
[15198.25s -> 15201.49s]  This is my carnival.
[15201.49s -> 15202.73s]  Zebra, zebra.
[15202.73s -> 15208.14s]  Oh, almost.
[15208.14s -> 15209.66s]  Can you get the zebra?
[15209.66s -> 15211.78s]  Can you get the zebra before we move on?
[15211.78s -> 15213.08s]  Can you?
[15213.08s -> 15218.70s]  Can you get the zebra before we move on?
[15218.70s -> 15222.40s]  Come on.
[15222.40s -> 15223.60s]  Shroy it.
[15223.60s -> 15224.52s]  Shroly it.
[15224.52s -> 15225.60s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[15225.60s -> 15228.89s]  Appreciate that.
[15228.89s -> 15231.94s]  Do it for Shroly it, please.
[15231.94s -> 15232.94s]  Get Fortnite.
[15232.94s -> 15234.14s]  I stopped saying that.
[15234.14s -> 15236.06s]  Get orange Garfield.
[15236.06s -> 15237.70s]  Or the zebra, please.
[15237.70s -> 15242.35s]  Make it happen.
[15242.35s -> 15243.19s]  He wants another goat.
[15243.19s -> 15244.71s]  No, we got plenty of goats.
[15244.71s -> 15247.19s]  We don't need any more goats.
[15247.19s -> 15250.03s]  But that looks like maybe what you're going for here.
[15254.93s -> 15256.33s]  This is a lot of prizes, though.
[15282.73s -> 15284.87s]  This is fucking awesome.
[15284.87s -> 15286.31s]  I love every second of this.
[15286.31s -> 15287.47s]  I'm so happy about this.
[15287.47s -> 15289.98s]  I hope you guys had fun.
[15289.98s -> 15296.13s]  I want another goat.
[15296.13s -> 15298.88s]  Get me another goat.
[15298.88s -> 15299.72s]  No, no, no.
[15299.72s -> 15300.56s]  Oh, the seal.
[15300.56s -> 15305.43s]  The seal is important to me.
[15305.43s -> 15306.63s]  This is the last one.
[15306.63s -> 15307.47s]  One more.
[15307.47s -> 15309.35s]  Get either the zebra or the seal.
[15309.35s -> 15310.27s]  That's what I require.
[15310.27s -> 15312.57s]  That's what I demand.
[15312.57s -> 15313.49s]  Get the seal.
[15313.49s -> 15321.24s]  Last chance.
[15321.28s -> 15323.33s]  I demand the seal.
[15323.33s -> 15328.04s]  Get it for me.
[15328.04s -> 15328.88s]  What, Jerma, old?
[15328.88s -> 15329.72s]  What?
[15329.72s -> 15332.80s]  Why?
[15332.80s -> 15333.64s]  Get it.
[15333.64s -> 15334.68s]  I know.
[15334.68s -> 15336.44s]  You guys got Jerma pain last second.
[15336.44s -> 15338.52s]  You can do this.
[15338.52s -> 15339.72s]  I think they got it.
[15339.72s -> 15340.56s]  Just get the tail.
[15340.56s -> 15341.78s]  That's all you need.
[15341.78s -> 15342.58s]  Get the tail.
[15342.58s -> 15343.54s]  That's all you need.
[15343.54s -> 15344.38s]  Get the tail.
[15344.38s -> 15348.16s]  I know you got it.
[15348.16s -> 15349.44s]  Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
[15349.44s -> 15352.68s]  They went double time on this one.
[15352.68s -> 15354.61s]  You got, is that three?
[15354.61s -> 15355.85s]  There's no way that's three.
[15355.85s -> 15357.01s]  Is it three?
[15357.01s -> 15358.53s]  Holy shit, you went out with a bang.
[15358.53s -> 15360.42s]  No way.
[15360.42s -> 15361.30s]  No way.
[15361.30s -> 15363.87s]  It's three.
[15363.87s -> 15369.43s]  One.
[15369.43s -> 15372.23s]  Where is it?
[15372.23s -> 15373.73s]  Wait, what?
[15373.73s -> 15374.93s]  No, wait.
[15374.93s -> 15377.06s]  This is all you got?
[15377.06s -> 15378.34s]  No.
[15378.34s -> 15380.46s]  What?
[15380.46s -> 15383.40s]  This is it?
[15383.40s -> 15385.24s]  No.
[15385.24s -> 15387.29s]  Shit.
[15387.29s -> 15388.90s]  All right.
[15388.90s -> 15390.57s]  That's it.
[15390.57s -> 15391.73s]  Calling it there.
[15391.73s -> 15395.26s]  Nice work.
[15395.26s -> 15396.14s]  No, we're not going,
[15396.14s -> 15398.30s]  this thing's saying go over in my ear.
[15398.30s -> 15399.70s]  All right.
[15399.70s -> 15401.99s]  We are going to do,
[15401.99s -> 15403.11s]  we've had some more bits come in.
[15403.11s -> 15405.81s]  Let's maybe go ahead and turn on the money machine
[15405.81s -> 15406.65s]  one more time.
[15413.08s -> 15415.60s]  See, you guys can't hear this.
[15415.60s -> 15416.44s]  Maybe.
[15416.44s -> 15417.28s]  Maybe you can.
[15417.28s -> 15418.28s]  But every,
[15420.23s -> 15423.15s]  every like 30 or 40 seconds,
[15423.15s -> 15424.91s]  a balloon pops.
[15424.91s -> 15426.43s]  It's just like,
[15426.43s -> 15427.27s]  it's just,
[15427.27s -> 15428.59s]  everyone just kind of freezes and goes,
[15428.59s -> 15431.81s]  what the fuck was that over there?
[15431.81s -> 15433.85s]  But we're going to do the money machine one more time
[15433.85s -> 15436.30s]  to get the bits from the stream.
[15436.30s -> 15439.48s]  And then we're going to move over to something else.
[15439.48s -> 15440.32s]  Just stay there.
[15440.32s -> 15441.52s]  Don't move.
[15441.52s -> 15442.36s]  Hey, there it goes.
[15442.36s -> 15443.80s]  There's the money.
[15443.84s -> 15446.00s]  How much, how much money was it this time?
[15446.00s -> 15447.66s]  I don't know.
[15447.66s -> 15449.89s]  40 bucks.
[15449.89s -> 15450.73s]  40 bucks.
[15450.73s -> 15451.69s]  That's it.
[15451.69s -> 15455.88s]  Why is it not 4,000?
[15455.88s -> 15459.84s]  I need eye protection.
[15459.84s -> 15468.38s]  So I don't get my eye like slit.
[15468.38s -> 15470.68s]  40 bucks.
[15470.68s -> 15471.72s]  No, don't lock me.
[15471.72s -> 15474.37s]  Like you make it so scary.
[15474.37s -> 15478.83s]  Oh no, that's another balloon.
[15478.83s -> 15527.16s]  I'm ready to get the money.
[15527.16s -> 15528.74s]  Come on.
[15528.74s -> 15529.58s]  What's that?
[15529.58s -> 15545.18s]  It's all of the sealant.
[15545.18s -> 15561.58s]  Okay.
[15561.58s -> 15566.50s]  Later.
[15566.50s -> 15576.72s]  We got at least a dollar and one cent.
[15577.72s -> 15581.36s]  You know at least for a couple of cameras.
[15581.36s -> 15583.40s]  Hold on, just wait a minute.
[15583.40s -> 15585.40s]  I've got, no, don't put this on camera.
[15594.59s -> 15595.87s]  No, they can see it over there.
[15595.87s -> 15597.47s]  They can see it in the mirror.
[15597.47s -> 15601.44s]  Just cut to the, it's like 15 bucks.
[15601.44s -> 15602.28s]  All right.
[15602.28s -> 15608.26s]  So it's like, we got, we got 15.
[15608.26s -> 15609.22s]  We got, which one is it?
[15609.22s -> 15610.06s]  This one?
[15610.06s -> 15613.11s]  We got $15 and two cents.
[15613.11s -> 15618.36s]  Congratulations.
[15618.36s -> 15620.24s]  No way, I got a 10.
[15620.24s -> 15623.39s]  I got a 10 here.
[15623.91s -> 15625.43s]  Seal, seal, seal, seal.
[15625.43s -> 15628.72s]  Where?
[15628.72s -> 15629.56s]  Where?
[15629.56s -> 15630.83s]  What?
[15630.83s -> 15632.28s]  What are you talking about?
[15632.28s -> 15633.12s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[15633.12s -> 15635.13s]  It was seal, where, where?
[15635.13s -> 15637.80s]  Trapped.
[15637.80s -> 15640.96s]  Where's the seal trapped?
[15640.96s -> 15643.73s]  Where's the, what are you talking about?
[15643.73s -> 15645.69s]  Get the seal, get the seal, foot cam.
[15645.69s -> 15648.36s]  No, where's the seal?
[15648.36s -> 15651.53s]  Free the seal.
[15651.53s -> 15653.89s]  You are on top of that today.
[15653.89s -> 15659.53s]  You are literally like making my life trouble.
[15659.53s -> 15664.88s]  He's just like aiming down.
[15664.88s -> 15668.07s]  It's in the claw machine?
[15668.11s -> 15668.95s]  No, you guys lost.
[15668.95s -> 15669.79s]  I'm sorry.
[15669.79s -> 15670.63s]  You didn't win.
[15670.63s -> 15673.96s]  So what we're gonna do now is
[15673.96s -> 15677.66s]  we are going to show you
[15677.66s -> 15678.82s]  somewhere in the beginning of the stream,
[15678.82s -> 15681.98s]  you were getting a caricature done of yourself.
[15681.98s -> 15683.62s]  We're gonna reveal that and show you
[15683.62s -> 15685.86s]  what the artist has created.
[15685.86s -> 15688.66s]  If we're gonna cut back to,
[15688.66s -> 15690.94s]  who do you think we're cutting back to?
[15690.94s -> 15697.84s]  Cuddles and Polly polite right now.
[15699.49s -> 15700.57s]  What's on that screen?
[15700.57s -> 15701.41s]  Who is the,
[15703.60s -> 15716.71s]  it's a view.
[15716.71s -> 15718.15s]  I can't wait to see this.
[15718.15s -> 15719.15s]  I did it.
[15719.15s -> 15719.99s]  You did it?
[15719.99s -> 15720.83s]  I did it.
[15720.83s -> 15721.65s]  You finished.
[15721.65s -> 15722.73s]  I finished.
[15722.73s -> 15724.47s]  So you've painted, who have you painted here?
[15724.47s -> 15728.27s]  I have painted a very special audience member.
[15728.27s -> 15730.47s]  Okay, so you got a special audience member.
[15730.47s -> 15732.35s]  I did, I found one.
[15732.35s -> 15733.19s]  You got one?
[15733.19s -> 15734.03s]  I did.
[15734.03s -> 15734.87s]  Okay, well why don't we show,
[15734.87s -> 15736.07s]  there's a special audience member here
[15736.07s -> 15737.79s]  that we're gonna be showing.
[15737.79s -> 15739.03s]  Let's see who it is.
[15739.03s -> 15740.79s]  Are you ready?
[15740.79s -> 15742.39s]  Who did you paint?
[15742.39s -> 15748.37s]  Here we go.
[15748.37s -> 15750.89s]  Oh, she got you.
[15750.89s -> 15752.37s]  That's you.
[15752.37s -> 15753.21s]  Wow.
[15753.21s -> 15754.05s]  That's you.
[15754.05s -> 15754.87s]  Is that me?
[15754.87s -> 15755.71s]  That's you.
[15755.71s -> 15756.97s]  No, I think that might be me.
[15756.97s -> 15758.25s]  Is that me?
[15758.25s -> 15759.25s]  Is that you?
[15759.25s -> 15760.09s]  No, that's you.
[15760.09s -> 15760.91s]  That's you.
[15760.91s -> 15761.75s]  That's you.
[15761.75s -> 15762.57s]  Wow.
[15762.57s -> 15764.67s]  Unbelievable.
[15764.67s -> 15766.87s]  That looks just like you.
[15766.87s -> 15767.71s]  It does.
[15767.71s -> 15768.71s]  It looks like you too.
[15768.71s -> 15769.63s]  Yeah, it really does.
[15769.63s -> 15770.83s]  It looks just like you.
[15770.83s -> 15771.84s]  Yeah.
[15771.84s -> 15776.84s]  Well, thank you so much to Cuddles and Polly polite
[15777.04s -> 15779.36s]  for their wonderful job and a great painting too.
[15779.36s -> 15782.26s]  Watch out, she's gonna steal my socks.
[15782.26s -> 15784.10s]  No, these are mine.
[15784.10s -> 15784.94s]  These are mine.
[15784.94s -> 15786.26s]  These are mine.
[15786.26s -> 15787.22s]  These are my socks.
[15787.22s -> 15790.19s]  Okay.
[15790.19s -> 15794.29s]  So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna do something.
[15794.29s -> 15796.93s]  That was a pretty good caricature of you.
[15796.93s -> 15797.93s]  I think so, of me.
[15797.93s -> 15799.37s]  And there's like a dollar bill
[15799.37s -> 15801.33s]  like going down my underwear right now.
[15802.57s -> 15804.85s]  There is a dollar bill going down my underwear
[15804.85s -> 15806.23s]  at the moment.
[15806.23s -> 15809.47s]  And it's currently causing me some discomfort.
[15809.47s -> 15811.43s]  So I'm gonna go ahead and try to fix that
[15811.43s -> 15814.76s]  while we move on.
[15814.76s -> 15816.96s]  What we're gonna do now,
[15816.96s -> 15820.05s]  we're gonna go back to the fan favorite machine
[15820.05s -> 15821.53s]  because I know a lot of you are probably saying,
[15821.53s -> 15823.25s]  Jeremy, yeah, Jeremy, Jeremy sucks.
[15823.25s -> 15825.19s]  And I know it's fine.
[15825.19s -> 15826.51s]  But what we're gonna do is we're gonna do
[15826.51s -> 15830.27s]  one more segment with the dunk tank
[15830.27s -> 15832.79s]  because I know a lot of you wanted to see that again
[15832.79s -> 15834.64s]  and try to dunk me again.
[15834.64s -> 15835.76s]  So that is what we're going to do
[15835.76s -> 15841.07s]  when we come back from potentially a few minute break.
[15841.07s -> 15841.91s]  We're gonna come back
[15841.91s -> 15844.80s]  and we're going to do the dunk tank one more time.
[15844.80s -> 15849.56s]  So if we will cut to a be right back screen,
[15849.56s -> 15851.10s]  we'll be back in just a moment
[15851.10s -> 15992.87s]  for one more dunk tank extraordinaire.
[15992.87s -> 15994.07s]  This is the main event.
[15994.07s -> 15998.73s]  So I figured we'd do it for a little bit longer.
[15998.73s -> 15999.93s]  Try to dunk me.
[15999.93s -> 16002.29s]  We're gonna do this until we break the machine.
[16002.29s -> 16005.33s]  So what I think I would like to do
[16005.33s -> 16007.89s]  is if the folks over at Andy Mark,
[16007.89s -> 16009.21s]  the supplier of the robots,
[16009.21s -> 16010.61s]  they did, first of all, let me just say,
[16010.61s -> 16015.09s]  they did a fantastic, a fantastic fucking job
[16015.09s -> 16017.77s]  this whole day with the robots and everything.
[16018.65s -> 16020.86s]  It's been an absolute delight.
[16020.86s -> 16023.46s]  Incredibly talented, fucking awesome people there.
[16024.34s -> 16026.34s]  We're gonna try to break this bot.
[16026.34s -> 16029.42s]  So if you could, whoever is in control,
[16030.30s -> 16032.08s]  drop the slow mode to zero.
[16032.08s -> 16033.30s]  Let's try to break this fucking thing.
[16033.30s -> 16034.54s]  Let's make it happen.
[16034.54s -> 16035.82s]  Drop the slow mode to zero.
[16035.82s -> 16039.50s]  Let's try to kill this bot and try to drop me down.
[16041.73s -> 16043.42s]  If you could.
[16043.42s -> 16044.68s]  Let's see what we can do
[16044.68s -> 16047.92s]  with one more dunk tank appearance.
[16047.92s -> 16050.11s]  I'm ready.
[16050.95s -> 16051.79s]  I don't know if this is a test or not,
[16051.79s -> 16056.14s]  but we're gonna find out.
[16056.14s -> 16057.42s]  Get rid of slow mode.
[16057.42s -> 16060.38s]  It's been on five, 10 seconds the whole night.
[16060.38s -> 16065.21s]  Get rid of it.
[16065.21s -> 16066.05s]  It's like,
[16067.81s -> 16071.88s]  holy shit.
[16071.88s -> 16076.29s]  No, that's not gonna do anything.
[16076.29s -> 16078.76s]  You're gonna set it to space.
[16078.76s -> 16080.32s]  Seven seconds, come on.
[16084.72s -> 16085.64s]  There it goes.
[16085.64s -> 16089.92s]  See you later, come on.
[16089.92s -> 16090.76s]  Where is it?
[16091.64s -> 16093.64s]  Where are you going?
[16093.64s -> 16094.84s]  I think they broke it.
[16097.32s -> 16101.32s]  All it took was one time.
[16101.32s -> 16102.52s]  It's still going.
[16102.52s -> 16104.32s]  All right, this is freaking me out.
[16104.32s -> 16113.33s]  I'm kind of scared of this too much.
[16113.33s -> 16114.53s]  Okay, you broke it.
[16114.53s -> 16116.41s]  You already broke it.
[16116.41s -> 16119.57s]  So we're gonna go back to the five to 10 second slow mode
[16119.57s -> 16122.19s]  because you've already broke it.
[16122.19s -> 16123.73s]  This thing is seeing so much.
[16123.73s -> 16124.57s]  It's been hit.
[16124.57s -> 16126.69s]  It's been run through the ringer so many times.
[16126.69s -> 16129.05s]  I can't believe it still works.
[16129.05s -> 16132.53s]  That just shows how well-made this thing is.
[16132.53s -> 16135.49s]  It's taking thousands of commands at the same time.
[16135.49s -> 16136.45s]  So you broke it.
[16136.45s -> 16138.77s]  So congratulations, you didn't even fire it.
[16140.05s -> 16142.41s]  So we're gonna go back to the way it was.
[16142.41s -> 16143.45s]  Dunk me.
[16143.45s -> 16146.72s]  Let's do it.
[16146.72s -> 16152.03s]  I have no monitor so I don't know what's happening.
[16152.03s -> 16153.87s]  Why are my nails painted?
[16153.87s -> 16155.07s]  Oh, that's paint.
[16155.07s -> 16155.91s]  You know what I mean.
[16155.91s -> 16157.61s]  It was paint from earlier.
[16157.61s -> 16159.13s]  Did you piss on this?
[16159.13s -> 16160.81s]  Remember I made that joke like three hours ago?
[16160.81s -> 16168.21s]  Yeah, you did.
[16168.21s -> 16175.56s]  Dunk me, let's go.
[16175.56s -> 16177.52s]  Uh-oh, that's close, close, close.
[16177.52s -> 16184.00s]  A little more to the left, pull it in.
[16184.00s -> 16185.32s]  Oh, Jesus.
[16186.28s -> 16187.64s]  Oh, God.
[16187.64s -> 16192.68s]  You might as well.
[16192.68s -> 16195.17s]  You know, all the toys,
[16195.17s -> 16198.05s]  everything you guys collected is right here.
[16198.05s -> 16199.65s]  So remember, if you dunk me,
[16202.52s -> 16203.72s]  and the Fortnite Garfield,
[16204.68s -> 16205.86s]  and the Zebra,
[16207.16s -> 16208.88s]  and the, I don't know.
[16210.20s -> 16211.04s]  Wait a minute.
[16213.40s -> 16215.40s]  I can feel this and I gotta figure it out.
[16217.53s -> 16222.48s]  This two cents in my underwear.
[16226.07s -> 16226.91s]  Hold on, hold on.
[16226.91s -> 16229.11s]  There's like this money in my pants.
[16229.11s -> 16232.35s]  I have like, that's a dollar.
[16232.35s -> 16233.87s]  That's one dollar.
[16234.75s -> 16237.35s]  I feel like incredible.
[16237.35s -> 16243.96s]  One dollar.
[16243.96s -> 16251.80s]  If you dunk me, you get rid of all the goats too.
[16251.80s -> 16253.64s]  I'm scared.
[16253.64s -> 16255.48s]  I'm scared.
[16255.48s -> 16258.27s]  I think I've removed all the money from my underwear.
[16258.27s -> 16260.24s]  Have I?
[16260.24s -> 16261.96s]  One more.
[16261.96s -> 16262.80s]  You know when you go to the beach
[16262.80s -> 16265.48s]  and you just feel the sand just all over you.
[16265.48s -> 16268.00s]  There's like this like one cent bit donations
[16268.00s -> 16270.28s]  all over my like underwear right now.
[16270.28s -> 16271.80s]  I think I'm all right.
[16271.80s -> 16273.00s]  We lost somebody though.
[16276.78s -> 16277.62s]  Did it die?
[16279.92s -> 16280.76s]  It killed it.
[16280.76s -> 16281.60s]  We're dying.
[16283.98s -> 16286.10s]  For every minute that it's not ready,
[16286.10s -> 16293.24s]  another Garfield goes in the fucking tank.
[16293.24s -> 16304.21s]  No, I want that in my office.
[16304.21s -> 16308.01s]  Why is it not coming towards me?
[16308.01s -> 16311.38s]  Get the fuck over here.
[16311.42s -> 16312.82s]  These are actually pretty nice.
[16312.82s -> 16313.66s]  These are nice.
[16318.85s -> 16319.69s]  He's in there.
[16319.69s -> 16320.53s]  He's just in there.
[16320.53s -> 16321.37s]  I can't get him up.
[16323.84s -> 16325.20s]  There goes another one.
[16325.20s -> 16326.32s]  No, I want to save these.
[16326.32s -> 16327.16s]  I don't want them.
[16327.16s -> 16328.68s]  I don't want.
[16328.68s -> 16330.20s]  I got to save Fortnite Garfield.
[16330.20s -> 16331.64s]  That's the most important one.
[16337.37s -> 16338.21s]  All right.
[16338.21s -> 16340.23s]  We're good.
[16340.23s -> 16341.07s]  I got him.
[16341.07s -> 16343.00s]  He's saved.
[16343.00s -> 16344.52s]  I feel like Steve Urkel.
[16344.52s -> 16346.44s]  My pants are riding so far up.
[16346.68s -> 16347.52s]  Oh.
[16349.95s -> 16354.63s]  Oh.
[16354.63s -> 16358.23s]  Get a hang.
[16358.23s -> 16359.23s]  Oh, you like Garfield?
[16359.23s -> 16360.23s]  You like Fortnite Garfield?
[16360.23s -> 16361.07s]  Oh, do you like him?
[16361.07s -> 16361.91s]  Do you like him?
[16370.53s -> 16374.17s]  Wait, hold on.
[16374.17s -> 16387.15s]  He's fine.
[16387.15s -> 16388.31s]  Only done it twice.
[16388.31s -> 16389.91s]  Can you do it a third time?
[16389.91s -> 16391.82s]  I don't know.
[16391.82s -> 16393.70s]  I'm just the fucking idiot in a tank
[16394.92s -> 16397.12s]  that has to accept whatever happens.
[16397.12s -> 16398.52s]  Oh, I felt that one.
[16398.52s -> 16399.68s]  That was pretty close.
[16403.11s -> 16405.35s]  Hey, fucking fucking Fortnite.
[16405.35s -> 16406.35s]  Fortnite sucks.
[16411.02s -> 16427.12s]  I hate this Fortnite.
[16427.12s -> 16428.56s]  I can't do it.
[16428.56s -> 16429.40s]  I'm trying.
[16430.28s -> 16431.60s]  I'm doing what I can.
[16442.73s -> 16446.87s]  I'm still dry.
[16446.87s -> 16447.71s]  Should I pop a balloon?
[16447.71s -> 16448.55s]  What do you think?
[16448.55s -> 16449.39s]  It'll scare me.
[16454.96s -> 16457.40s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[16457.40s -> 16458.44s]  Let me get this out.
[16469.08s -> 16478.37s]  Is it going to pop if I put it?
[16478.37s -> 16479.21s]  Don't use your teeth.
[16479.21s -> 16480.05s]  Oh, I'm okay.
[16480.73s -> 16482.94s]  Gross.
[16482.94s -> 16502.04s]  I don't want this to pop.
[16502.04s -> 16504.46s]  Why is there still the air in it?
[16504.46s -> 16505.54s]  All right, get it away from me.
[16505.54s -> 16506.58s]  Oh, whoops.
[16506.58s -> 16507.66s]  No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16507.66s -> 16512.18s]  Oh, there it goes.
[16512.18s -> 16513.02s]  The machine broke.
[16515.30s -> 16517.14s]  I can't believe it took this much anyways.
[16517.14s -> 16518.42s]  Look at this hair.
[16518.42s -> 16520.38s]  I gotta get a haircut.
[16520.38s -> 16521.22s]  Get it.
[16529.30s -> 16534.25s]  What camera are we on?
[16534.25s -> 16538.20s]  Over here?
[16538.20s -> 16539.44s]  Eat shit.
[16539.44s -> 16541.80s]  I got goats for days, motherfucker.
[16548.04s -> 16568.32s]  Oh, shit.
[16568.32s -> 16569.16s]  It's never gonna happen.
[16569.16s -> 16570.12s]  Hey, go to the GoPro.
[16570.76s -> 16571.60s]  No, don't do that.
[16571.60s -> 16573.71s]  I zoomed in gross face.
[16576.31s -> 16577.31s]  You can do it.
[16577.31s -> 16578.15s]  I know you can.
[16578.15s -> 16579.95s]  We got two more shots before the robot
[16579.95s -> 16582.23s]  is no longer functional.
[16591.88s -> 16595.51s]  Didn't work.
[16595.51s -> 16598.97s]  The bot is grinding.
[16598.97s -> 16603.63s]  We got one more shot.
[16603.63s -> 16605.84s]  Last shot.
[16605.84s -> 16607.64s]  Oh, God.
[16607.64s -> 16609.16s]  We've grinded it to a halt.
[16611.13s -> 16611.97s]  Oh, shit.
[16622.48s -> 16624.64s]  That robot actually was done.
[16624.64s -> 16627.48s]  The grinding part of it is done.
[16628.44s -> 16629.28s]  Oh, my God.
[16629.28s -> 16630.12s]  That's funny.
[16630.12s -> 16632.50s]  Why did you guys do this shit on the last time?
[16632.50s -> 16635.10s]  The last time, every time.
[16635.10s -> 16636.50s]  You get the pressure involved,
[16636.50s -> 16638.46s]  and then all of a sudden you do it.
[16638.46s -> 16640.80s]  Oh, my God.
[16640.80s -> 16647.32s]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's gonna be it.
[16647.32s -> 16649.80s]  Thank you so much, everybody, for joining.
[16649.80s -> 16650.88s]  You might have thought that was rigged.
[16650.88s -> 16651.72s]  It's not.
[16651.72s -> 16652.56s]  That was the last shot.
[16652.56s -> 16654.16s]  That robot could possibly be fucking done.
[16654.32s -> 16655.16s]  It's broken.
[16655.16s -> 16656.00s]  It's fucked up.
[16656.00s -> 16658.00s]  It's been through hell, this whole stream.
[16659.57s -> 16663.25s]  Why am I like, oh, they splash around in this disgusting water.
[16663.25s -> 16666.45s]  By the way, this has been here for probably 48 hours.
[16666.45s -> 16667.41s]  And somebody pissed in it.
[16667.41s -> 16668.25s]  At least two people did.
[16668.25s -> 16669.09s]  I know they did.
[16669.09s -> 16669.93s]  I can smell it.
[16669.93s -> 16671.49s]  It's been filled with ice.
[16671.49s -> 16672.33s]  You know what?
[16672.33s -> 16673.17s]  Let's accept it.
[16674.41s -> 16678.18s]  That's the end of the stream, everybody.
[16678.18s -> 16679.86s]  Thank you so much.
[16679.86s -> 16681.50s]  I really can't even express how much
[16681.50s -> 16683.46s]  I can fucking thank everybody for participating.
[16683.46s -> 16685.14s]  Even trying.
[16685.98s -> 16688.10s]  You did very well considering the circumstances,
[16688.10s -> 16691.10s]  so thank you so much to everybody that participated.
[16691.10s -> 16694.50s]  Special, huge thank you to Andy Mark.
[16694.50s -> 16695.94s]  They've made all these bots,
[16695.94s -> 16697.58s]  they made this whole thing possible.
[16697.58s -> 16699.46s]  Without them, this does not happen.
[16699.46s -> 16701.62s]  So Andy Mark absolutely killed it.
[16701.62s -> 16704.30s]  Thank you so much for even giving the robots
[16704.30s -> 16706.46s]  and putting the technology in place
[16706.46s -> 16708.42s]  and making it happen to control the chat.
[16708.42s -> 16711.26s]  JK Productions, another company that came in
[16711.26s -> 16712.58s]  and just knocked this out of the park
[16712.58s -> 16716.58s]  with location and media services
[16716.58s -> 16719.10s]  and just fucking unbelievable work.
[16719.10s -> 16721.42s]  And then, thank you to you.
[16721.42s -> 16723.22s]  I said that already, but thank you so much.
[16723.22s -> 16726.46s]  I am going to take a shower.
[16726.46s -> 16727.50s]  I hope you enjoyed this.
[16727.50s -> 16729.18s]  It's been a wild ride.
[16730.06s -> 16732.62s]  I'll see you in a few days when I come back.
[16732.62s -> 16735.54s]  And we play, I don't know, fucking like Mario Kart
[16735.54s -> 16737.62s]  for like fucking four hours.
[16737.62s -> 16738.98s]  See you next time.
[16738.98s -> 16740.42s]  Take care.
[16740.42s -> 16741.26s]  Good luck.
[16741.26s -> 16742.08s]  Good night.
[16742.08s -> 16743.28s]  See you when I get back.
[16745.99s -> 16747.63s]  This fucking tank.
[16747.63s -> 16748.91s]  I'm gonna puke on stream.
[16891.17s -> 16905.24s]  I did too.
[16905.24s -> 16907.15s]  Who gives a shit?
[16907.15s -> 16907.99s]  It's my motto from now on.
[16907.99s -> 16915.32s]  Who gives a shit?
[16915.32s -> 16917.12s]  I feel like a fucking game show host.
[16917.12s -> 16920.44s]  Hey, who gives a shit?
[16920.44s -> 16922.80s]  Can I knock?
[16922.80s -> 16924.44s]  You know, that took like an hour and a half to set up.
[16924.44s -> 16931.15s]  Don't even knock it over.
[16931.15s -> 16933.90s]  No, no, it went away.
[16933.90s -> 16935.02s]  Hey, my motto from now on.
[16935.02s -> 16936.59s]  Who gives a shit?
[16936.59s -> 16937.59s]  Sure, my nine eight five.
[16937.59s -> 16942.62s]  Don't step on any nails in like four or five days.
[16942.62s -> 16959.86s]  Who gives a shit?
