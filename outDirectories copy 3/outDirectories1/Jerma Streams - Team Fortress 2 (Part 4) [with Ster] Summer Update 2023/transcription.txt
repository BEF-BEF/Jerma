[23.61s -> 31.99s]  Hello, hey man. Hey, what's up? I didn't do my tweet yet. Oh, you said hi there. I
[31.99s -> 36.29s]  thought that was an invitation. Well I see I said hi there because you said you
[36.29s -> 41.33s]  had me say hello so I was responding to myself before you. What are you talking
[41.33s -> 46.69s]  about? What do you mean? You just you have like a soundboard that says hello?
[46.69s -> 53.78s]  Can I at least give you a new one? A new hello? Yeah. That one's old. I don't like it. I don't
[53.82s -> 62.39s]  know if I have it set up correctly right now. Say something. Hello. I don't have it
[62.39s -> 67.01s]  set up right. Do you really want me to take the moment and get the new hello?
[67.01s -> 80.98s]  No, no. God no. Oh, God no. Why not? Why do you do a folder on your computer
[80.98s -> 87.50s]  that's just Jerma saying hello? Wow, ego on this guy. It's also Ashley and Ronnie
[87.50s -> 93.61s]  and I think someone else. It's just a randomized hello from multiple people. Oh
[93.61s -> 101.90s]  it's randomized. Okay. All right. Let me tweet in as a TF2 with stirliftsfood 2014
[101.90s -> 112.90s]  time machine active. That looks good. Looks good to me. It does. Okay. Hi stir.
[112.90s -> 118.26s]  How are you? I'm good. How the heck are you? Headshots. I'm going crazy with the
[118.26s -> 123.58s]  headshots in my chat still saying lol aim for the head. So good luck today pal.
[123.58s -> 127.26s]  All right. So are we gonna be on a team together and we're gonna queue for team
[127.30s -> 138.54s]  Fortress 2. Are we? Yeah. Can we please God? All right. You want to just do I have to
[138.54s -> 142.78s]  wait for you to be done? No, I can leave. Are you ready? Like now? Or are you ready?
[142.78s -> 147.50s]  Like already? I'm hold on. I didn't say I didn't do my like intro. Shut up. Shut
[147.50s -> 156.13s]  up. Shut up. I'm ready. Can you invite me? Yeah. I should be able to be invited to a
[156.17s -> 165.28s]  game. You just have to be appearing online. I mean, uh, my God, there's there.
[165.28s -> 171.12s]  There. There throw a tantrum there. I'm on. Is your name like it's a break the
[171.12s -> 188.42s]  fish. You'll find it. You have to be in the game. I'm in the game. Well, it
[188.42s -> 196.60s]  didn't work. Why not? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Are you me? Yes. All right. I think
[196.60s -> 206.98s]  it's gonna happen. I said I said yes. I said I clicked on play game. Sure. What's
[206.98s -> 221.49s]  happening after rejoin? Maybe let me try inviting you. You have to do it from the
[221.49s -> 235.45s]  main menu, not the steam invite. Oh shit. I disabled my entire friend panel in the
[235.45s -> 247.90s]  config file. Hold on. Okay. How come I have this thing next to my name? You know
[248.02s -> 252.78s]  you carry on. I'll get this figured out. I'll get this figured out. I downloaded a
[252.78s -> 258.50s]  custom HUD and shit and I fucking deleted the whole friend panel. You need
[258.50s -> 267.06s]  the friend panel. Hold on. Here's the bigger question though. Why? How come on
[267.06s -> 272.10s]  my steam is permanently broken? What do you mean permanently broken? I can't
[272.10s -> 278.14s]  ever be invited to what's going on with my voice. Why did you do this? I can't
[278.14s -> 283.26s]  get invited to any games. Nobody can ever invite me. This is I'm like
[283.26s -> 287.26s]  permanently blocked forever. You might be shadow banned, but this one again is
[287.26s -> 291.18s]  not like technically steam invites don't work. This is from the main menu. All
[291.18s -> 296.81s]  right. Give me a second. I can invite you in two seconds. Yeah. Maybe you have your
[296.81s -> 301.13s]  privacy on no friends. I'm ashamed of my friends and I didn't want their names to
[301.13s -> 307.10s]  wait a minute. Wait a minute. You don't want your friends like furry avatars to
[307.58s -> 312.10s]  No, it's just like you get like 7,000 friend requests that you steam did this
[312.10s -> 315.74s]  thing where you could never like stop that from happening. You remember that?
[315.74s -> 323.10s]  No, no. I remember having so many friend requests that you actually couldn't send
[323.10s -> 326.80s]  anymore and I left it that way so that I wouldn't get anymore and every time I
[326.80s -> 331.26s]  wanted to actually let someone on my friends list I had to like ignore and
[331.26s -> 335.06s]  deny one person. Otherwise they couldn't send a friend request because steam
[335.06s -> 340.94s]  couldn't handle it. Going through the console command? No, we have to be in a
[340.94s -> 347.51s]  party as we queuing up casual. Let me take one second and see if there's like
[347.51s -> 351.75s]  something fucked up in my steam because I got a problem. If your chat tells you
[351.75s -> 355.15s]  to do something they're telling you how to do it from the perspective of it's
[355.15s -> 360.99s]  2010. That's true. Hold on. So when they tell you like oh do the Sandman canteen
[360.99s -> 373.03s]  combo, it'll be fun. Don't listen to them. Yeah, like friends. I'm just gonna turn
[373.03s -> 377.83s]  the panel back on just to add you. I don't care. Yeah. I don't know why
[377.83s -> 383.51s]  like I just can't ever be invited anywhere. My steam profile is private but
[383.51s -> 391.72s]  yours is too, isn't it? No. Oh, maybe that's why. Yeah, friends only. My basic
[391.72s -> 398.13s]  details are public. That's fine. Profile friends. Do you remember one and a half
[398.13s -> 401.61s]  hours ago when I asked if you wanted to like test anything or anything else we
[401.61s -> 405.13s]  could do before? Well I didn't know that this was gonna be an issue. First time I
[405.13s -> 420.24s]  opened this game in like 10 years. What if I do this? All right, let me try that.
[420.24s -> 431.57s]  If that helps. That could fix it. If this doesn't work then just join a game and
[431.57s -> 436.01s]  I'm gonna change a few options in my. It actually says you're playing TF2 now
[436.01s -> 443.66s]  which is a step up. Oh it does. I don't think it was before. Oh, I fixed it. Do you like that we
[443.66s -> 453.62s]  both have default medic icons? Oh we do. We do both have default
[453.66s -> 462.96s]  medic icons. That's kind of funny. Great minds think alike. Yeah they do. Okay, you
[462.96s -> 470.30s]  joined a community server is what it's saying. Okay, well it's the thing for the
[470.30s -> 481.52s]  decal thing. Oh, okay. I thought okay. All right, we good? Yes. So you should be
[481.52s -> 486.43s]  able to invite me now. I sent you to the invite to the party and it instantly
[486.43s -> 491.23s]  disappears and it does not show you as inviteable. It like instantly just
[491.23s -> 498.51s]  closes. Why? Why the fuck is this happening? All right. You invite me.
[498.51s -> 503.11s]  You just go. Let me figure this out. I don't know. You invite me. I know but I
[503.11s -> 507.91s]  have to like re-enable my friends panel. Okay, well can we talk about like
[507.91s -> 514.12s]  sausages or something? Well, if you want. What do you want to talk about? Um, I
[514.12s -> 518.56s]  don't know. Like when do you think civilization started? I think that is a
[518.56s -> 522.68s]  lot of things during the pyramid times and maybe even before the pyramids. Where
[522.68s -> 526.08s]  there is, we already talked about this. You didn't just immediately say sauce.
[526.08s -> 537.62s]  Has your opinion changed? Um, hold on. I can't do two things at once. Give me a
[537.62s -> 541.14s]  little bit of slack. Hey, when you first opened TF2 after like eight years, you
[541.14s -> 545.38s]  probably spent like a long time figuring this out. And that's why I offered to
[545.38s -> 548.14s]  help. Yeah, but then you all but you offered to help but then you set up
[548.14s -> 552.18s]  starting early and you ran away and turned your stream on. And I was like, I
[552.18s -> 563.58s]  thought he was gonna help me. You did do that. You did say that. Not quite that.
[563.58s -> 574.60s]  Yeah, you did do that. You did say that. Yep. Okay. Let me just re-enable this. So
[574.60s -> 581.20s]  what is of all the new maps? There's like 30 new maps, right? The best map that
[581.20s -> 589.66s]  everyone talks about is the meme map with the seal on it. Okay. And then
[589.66s -> 598.32s]  there's like upward and. Are you just playing like the old map still? Um, I
[598.32s -> 605.26s]  have it queue me into the new maps. A mix of both. Okay. I like Phoenix. Phoenix's
[605.26s -> 615.55s]  first point is pretty cool. Did they add anything else? I saw like the cases. Like
[615.55s -> 619.75s]  I opened it for a second to see. They added an official versus Saxton Hale mode
[619.75s -> 624.07s]  and it's actually not that bad. As someone who never really liked Saxton
[624.07s -> 628.95s]  Hale. He has like three abilities he can use and it's a whole like set up for it.
[629.63s -> 634.67s]  Okay. Give me. I'm gonna mute for a second. Did you hear what I just said? I did.
[634.67s -> 638.87s]  It's Saxton Hale stuff. Yep. Let's go. Okay. No, I'm just checking. I'm listening
[638.87s -> 643.67s]  but I'm like I have to go in like the command list shit. Let me see. Yeah. You
[643.67s -> 653.24s]  just you answered in a very dismissive manner. What's going on with this? Oh, that's
[653.24s -> 661.30s]  right. That's wrong thing. Hey. Okay. I should be able to do it now. Cool. I got
[661.30s -> 664.38s]  to play for 10 seconds. I got to. No, no, no, no, no, no. Like just just hang out.
[664.62s -> 675.37s]  Make sure it works first. Oh, sure. I shouldn't have to leave to get it. It's
[675.37s -> 678.41s]  been 10 years. Don't worry. We'll do a full intro. We'll do like a whole door.
[678.41s -> 684.91s]  Everyone can relax. I'm gonna do a full intro. We're gonna be. It's gonna be a
[684.91s -> 688.15s]  huge deal. It's gonna be a bunch of fucking cool stuff happening. Just wait.
[688.15s -> 692.71s]  Just hold on. It's been 10 years. What's up, guys? I didn't even take the splash
[692.95s -> 697.43s]  screen down. That's just how much I haven't really done. I mean, it's another
[697.43s -> 708.33s]  late night live commentary with German 985. Tonight, I'm going to be playing
[708.33s -> 728.15s]  as. Oh, wait. No, I'm going to be waiting. All right. Joe, Joe, I can join
[728.15s -> 737.44s]  your party. I do that. Can you can you do that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You did it.
[737.68s -> 745.93s]  I'm in. Okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna exit this game. Okay. I am going to kill us
[745.97s -> 758.90s]  or you want to see the new maps? Yes. How does this work? Do you want me to queue
[758.90s -> 766.20s]  for Saxton Hale as well? I we get it. I would like for you to queue us or it is
[766.20s -> 770.08s]  the new anything. Well, I want to just play Team Fortress for now. You know what
[770.08s -> 774.84s]  I mean? Okay. I just want to see if you see that's what happens. It's like cool.
[774.84s -> 777.40s]  There's 14 new maps. And then you join TF2 and you're like, I'm gonna play the
[777.40s -> 779.88s]  new maps. And then you're like, where's the health kit? Where's the health kit?
[780.12s -> 783.36s]  Where are they spawning? And you just run around into walls. And it's like this
[783.36s -> 786.56s]  isn't Team Fortress. I'm confused. Especially if you're like first games.
[789.58s -> 797.46s]  This is fucking cool. Alright, so first of all, let's go over what's going on
[797.46s -> 800.82s]  today. Today. It's only been like we've been sitting for like 12 minutes. 11
[800.82s -> 811.47s]  minutes. Sorry. Yeah. This is Team Fortress 2. There are honestly I really
[811.47s -> 815.51s]  we have to do this because it's probably like, no, shut up. Listen to me. No,
[815.51s -> 819.83s]  you're right. I'm laughing because I'm like, wait, do you know how many people
[819.87s -> 825.05s]  probably don't play this? This game's older than the people watching. There's
[825.05s -> 829.90s]  probably a lot of people that have no idea what's even going on. We have to
[829.90s -> 833.78s]  give a brief explanation of what Team Fortress is. While you explain it, can
[833.78s -> 843.38s]  you put like subway surfers on the side? No, I'm gonna show the game. If you're
[843.38s -> 847.26s]  good, you'll get a face cam. By the way, you have to be you guys gonna be good.
[848.40s -> 853.92s]  Are you ready? Am I joining this? Are we good? We're good. We're joining this. Are
[853.96s -> 858.53s]  you so ready? We're gonna look at all my points, dude. I would say it is
[858.53s -> 864.04s]  versus Saxton Hale. I don't know this map. Oh, it's versus Saxton Hale. Well,
[864.04s -> 867.80s]  this will be a good reminder. I don't know. I don't I don't want to play this.
[867.80s -> 872.73s]  I want to play team. Is this Team Fortress? Okay, we're leaving. No, no, no,
[872.73s -> 876.29s]  no, no, no, no, no. I left. I left. You already started complaining and the map
[876.29s -> 884.15s]  didn't even load yet. Okay. Trust me. All right. So do it again. I'm gonna put
[884.15s -> 887.35s]  you on a real map. We're gonna do a real map that you're aware of. I just you
[887.35s -> 893.18s]  like I have I okay, I loaded the game for like maybe 20 minutes and it was
[893.18s -> 899.14s]  just to buy keys. Okay, that's that's what I did. So I need how many did you
[899.14s -> 908.74s]  buy two or 300? Why? What? I made that up. I bought like 15. I don't like being
[908.74s -> 915.21s]  lied to as a joke. I don't respect that. Whatever happened to honesty. Everyone's
[915.21s -> 923.40s]  always like 15. I got 15. Okay, I don't know. I just like that. I have somebody
[923.44s -> 926.08s]  crates in my inventory. They don't even know what they are for. They might be
[926.08s -> 935.12s]  like rare. Do you know this map? I mean, I know I have the fucking pyro. Why is
[935.12s -> 941.51s]  this on? Oh, you're a spy. I can't heal you. You're good luck. All right. So this
[941.51s -> 948.64s]  is way. This is different. Oh, this is this HUD looks cool. I actually like this
[948.64s -> 955.43s]  HUD. I should customize it a little bit more. Okay, so how do I? Okay, I have a
[955.43s -> 961.97s]  gas can on. Wait, what's my menu? I don't want that. I want to I don't know what's
[961.97s -> 966.69s]  good nowadays like the flare gun still. Well, you're not in spawn, so it doesn't
[966.69s -> 974.26s]  matter. Sorry, whatever. I'll go back to change your view model. Is my view model
[974.26s -> 986.47s]  too big? People have been telling me that for like a week. Yeah, they don't know
[986.47s -> 992.81s]  the real TF2. What people want them the small view models. They make me want to
[992.81s -> 997.09s]  throw up. They make me upset as a boomer. I'm upset. Maybe the small ones. You
[997.09s -> 1004.44s]  mean view model underscore fov. Oh, I hate that too. When you can see their
[1004.44s -> 1024.30s]  arms. I'm a purist. Okay, it's going pretty good so far, I would say. Oh, I'll
[1024.30s -> 1027.70s]  keep it for now. Maybe I'll see how I like it. All right. I don't do I want to
[1027.70s -> 1033.06s]  play pirate. What do I want to do? What do you want to do? I don't know. What was
[1033.06s -> 1037.22s]  your favorite Team Fortress two class in the original Team Fortress two that
[1037.22s -> 1042.11s]  we're playing right now? It was this by this by for sure. Really? I'll do quick
[1042.11s -> 1052.29s]  fix uber saucer. This looks good. Oh, there's a moment. Hey, by the way, stir
[1052.33s -> 1063.12s]  just want to make sure I let you know. Where are you? Um, I'm dead. All right.
[1063.12s -> 1069.30s]  Well, I got a I got a quick fix for you when you get up. Are we doing that? I
[1069.30s -> 1074.14s]  mean, I'm I'm just healing because we need it. You just said your favorite
[1074.14s -> 1080.34s]  class was the spy. Why would I play as a spy? I'm a team player. A spy is a team
[1080.34s -> 1092.30s]  player, but we needed another medical. Okay, I'll come find you. My god. I'm
[1092.30s -> 1102.39s]  gonna activate over. I love the quick fixes uber. Is that is it bad?
[1105.55s -> 1111.23s]  I mean, it's it's it's why are you so scared of like what's considered good
[1111.23s -> 1114.91s]  and bad? Why can't you like, enjoy yourself? I am enjoying myself. And by
[1114.91s -> 1122.18s]  the way, I gotta let you know something, Star. It's over. Oh, oh, no, it's over.
[1123.87s -> 1125.03s]  Did you get the laugh track stuff?
[1126.04s -> 1133.95s]  Uh, no. Oh, okay. Well, never mind. I forgot I was supposed to get a laugh
[1133.95s -> 1137.63s]  track. I thought you were gonna have like a whole soundboard of like booze
[1137.63s -> 1143.27s]  and cheers and laugh track. I forgot. That was the bit I knew. Oh, he helped
[1143.27s -> 1148.51s]  me behind you. Not that soldier can pick up the health kit. I'm working on it. Do
[1148.51s -> 1153.63s]  this. Do that. Do what I say. I don't have the crits, by the way. If I get
[1153.63s -> 1157.79s]  backstabs, your fault. I know. Well, also, you're the medic. It's easier for
[1157.79s -> 1160.95s]  you to look around. But okay, now it's not because my beam will get detached.
[1161.15s -> 1169.03s]  What? Fuck? What? Oh, that's right. I move with you because I have the
[1169.19s -> 1170.35s]  fix. Oh, that's cool.
[1171.58s -> 1173.38s]  German versus star German versus star.
[1173.38s -> 1177.94s]  Everybody wants to see that happen. This is the reunion episode, guys.
[1178.46s -> 1181.14s]  Spee, spee, spee.
[1181.38s -> 1186.18s]  This stream is going to have like a four on fucking IMDb. Oh, god damn it. I'm
[1186.18s -> 1189.74s]  dead. This stream is gonna have like a four on IMDb because it's a reunion
[1189.74s -> 1193.46s]  episode. And we're just gonna say the jokes we've always said for like 14
[1193.46s -> 1197.90s]  years. And it's just gonna be flashbacks. And my hair is all gray and shit. Like
[1198.26s -> 1201.70s]  it's and by the way, it's been like eight years since we've even been on camera.
[1202.22s -> 1205.21s]  So I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that. And I lost.
[1205.21s -> 1206.37s]  Oh, let me get crits, actually.
[1207.67s -> 1209.59s]  Germa, the crits, the crits.
[1211.22s -> 1213.34s]  Wait, you want me to scream for the crits?
[1213.34s -> 1215.26s]  Yeah, let's go. Come on.
[1216.58s -> 1217.94s]  Hey, come on. We're back.
[1222.47s -> 1227.23s]  And then after I say that, it cuts like this part of the video, it cuts to like
[1227.23s -> 1231.03s]  total playtime in the next six months to like four hours and 10 minutes, which is
[1231.03s -> 1231.59s]  this stream.
[1233.24s -> 1234.92s]  Yeah, because you're not a real player.
[1235.24s -> 1235.76s]  You're Frank.
[1237.98s -> 1241.26s]  You know, it's in lore now that Matic is the soldier's sister.
[1242.83s -> 1243.31s]  You just die.
[1243.63s -> 1245.51s]  I did. I got I got hit right in the face.
[1247.34s -> 1248.82s]  Oh, dude, we're so back.
[1254.15s -> 1258.02s]  I do want to make the HUD a little different.
[1258.10s -> 1259.34s]  You can customize the whole thing, right?
[1259.94s -> 1262.14s]  This does look better than the default HUD in a way.
[1263.12s -> 1268.58s]  I always use the default HUD just because of, I don't know, I always felt like a
[1268.58s -> 1270.46s]  custom HUD crashed the game all the time.
[1270.58s -> 1272.18s]  But I guess it's been a long time.
[1275.30s -> 1276.42s]  What game were you playing?
[1277.67s -> 1278.87s]  I don't know, but you're doing pretty good.
[1279.59s -> 1280.47s]  You know what to do, by the way.
[1282.47s -> 1283.27s]  Oh, you're healing me.
[1283.27s -> 1287.39s]  Oh, OK. So Team Fortress 2 is a team based shooter.
[1288.99s -> 1290.11s]  There's a red team and a blue team.
[1290.11s -> 1292.31s]  You're probably looking at this and going like, what the heck's going on here?
[1293.18s -> 1297.91s]  So the cart, that blue cart is the objective for the blue team.
[1297.91s -> 1300.35s]  It is our job to stop them from pushing that object.
[1300.91s -> 1301.67s]  Hashtag ad.
[1304.42s -> 1306.46s]  All right. You know, hey, you know what you have to do.
[1308.66s -> 1310.58s]  Well, let's does this still work?
[1310.74s -> 1314.14s]  I haven't had like a medic where I like build Uber for you by damaging myself.
[1314.14s -> 1315.66s]  OK, let's go.
[1315.66s -> 1321.70s]  Oh, OK. You let me know when you're.
[1323.94s -> 1328.25s]  Oh, scout, scout, scout, scout, still alive, scout, still alive.
[1331.49s -> 1332.77s]  Oh, that's how you tell we're back.
[1332.77s -> 1334.29s]  That's how you can tell we're back.
[1334.29s -> 1340.15s]  That's how you know we're back.
[1340.15s -> 1341.95s]  But behind spy. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm a liar.
[1341.95s -> 1344.80s]  I lied. Liar, liar.
[1344.80s -> 1347.35s]  I don't want to pocket you. Why not?
[1348.22s -> 1350.80s]  Because that's how a team loses.
[1350.80s -> 1353.24s]  You don't have to.
[1353.24s -> 1355.64s]  Also, that's the opposite of true.
[1355.64s -> 1360.76s]  Is it? I always want to make sure the other medic is overhealed.
[1361.80s -> 1363.08s]  And what's over here?
[1363.08s -> 1370.74s]  I mean, that's true.
[1370.74s -> 1373.38s]  That spy has like 600 health.
[1373.38s -> 1374.26s]  Doesn't make any sense.
[1374.26s -> 1377.45s]  Kunai. Oh, he could have had Kunai health.
[1379.05s -> 1381.41s]  People saying, well, shitty aim, shitty aim.
[1381.41s -> 1384.85s]  Hold on. But a lot of people don't even know how this game works.
[1384.85s -> 1388.05s]  All right. Almost everything in this game is a projectile that he's playing
[1388.05s -> 1389.73s]  is mercy from Overwatch.
[1389.73s -> 1391.09s]  This game kind of just ripped it off.
[1391.09s -> 1392.69s]  You don't like really have to aim.
[1392.69s -> 1395.13s]  You just like kind of like put your beam on someone.
[1395.13s -> 1397.33s]  And then you say heroes never die.
[1397.33s -> 1399.81s]  No, you don't say that because this is Team Fortress.
[1401.38s -> 1405.46s]  But see that they have this an arc and it's all a projectile in the server.
[1405.86s -> 1408.14s]  And look at how far how long it takes to go to travel.
[1408.14s -> 1409.86s]  I see. I mean, everything's a projectile.
[1409.86s -> 1412.18s]  Skill shots.
[1412.18s -> 1414.14s]  Yeah, this game is skill shots only.
[1417.50s -> 1426.55s]  Oh, hi. Nice.
[1426.55s -> 1431.03s]  Yeah, this this feels this feels like the game that we played
[1431.35s -> 1434.90s]  for a very long time. Remember, fake hair everywhere.
[1435.06s -> 1436.10s]  That's a classic line.
[1436.10s -> 1438.58s]  What are the classic lines that we not said is this by
[1442.14s -> 1444.47s]  he's bored already?
[1444.47s -> 1447.35s]  Wow. This was just really like, oh, this is a game I played for years.
[1448.23s -> 1450.83s]  Oh, you guys, you guys have heard of this game viewfinder?
[1452.99s -> 1455.03s]  Yeah, we might have to take a rain rain check on that game.
[1455.59s -> 1457.31s]  Well, I feel like I'm going to play this a lot.
[1457.31s -> 1463.58s]  This is fun. Oh, he said it.
[1463.58s -> 1466.61s]  All right. We got. OK.
[1466.61s -> 1470.77s]  If you don't get at least seven kills with this, you need to do 10 push ups.
[1476.33s -> 1478.83s]  Well, I didn't get any with it.
[1478.83s -> 1485.36s]  But you got to do 10 push ups, bro.
[1485.36s -> 1487.12s]  I feel like that's on you to do the push ups.
[1487.12s -> 1491.27s]  What? No, I didn't need the crits.
[1491.81s -> 1494.42s]  Oh, my God. You killed like four people.
[1494.42s -> 1502.10s]  I got a random one. I got two of it there.
[1502.10s -> 1503.06s]  How about like you?
[1503.06s -> 1505.82s]  How about I do push ups, but you like lay under me?
[1512.43s -> 1514.67s]  Does that even work?
[1514.67s -> 1516.65s]  What are you talking?
[1516.65s -> 1518.65s]  I've you know, you know, wait, wait.
[1518.65s -> 1520.57s]  What? OK, I work out.
[1520.57s -> 1521.45s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1521.45s -> 1522.97s]  No, I don't want to die. I don't.
[1522.97s -> 1524.21s]  I'm going to kill this heavy.
[1524.21s -> 1527.53s]  The way, you know, if you go down a map, maximum depth on a push up.
[1528.33s -> 1529.53s]  As if you kiss.
[1529.53s -> 1533.73s]  OK, whatever you're saying, I just got I have a full Uber right now.
[1533.93s -> 1535.49s]  Where are you? I'm dead.
[1535.49s -> 1537.49s]  Well, get back alive.
[1537.49s -> 1538.49s]  I'm getting back alive.
[1538.49s -> 1539.41s]  I'm coming through a teleport.
[1539.41s -> 1540.61s]  I have to create a sniper.
[1540.61s -> 1541.93s]  Is this a bad? This is bad.
[1541.93s -> 1543.69s]  Don't do it. I'm behind you. I'm behind you. I'm behind you.
[1543.69s -> 1550.95s]  It's me. Let me know.
[1550.95s -> 1552.55s]  Yeah. You know, the signal.
[1552.55s -> 1557.09s]  Hmm. Good.
[1557.09s -> 1563.05s]  It's one. It's two.
[1563.05s -> 1567.78s]  Nice. Almost. Hey, we did it.
[1567.78s -> 1573.39s]  There is no one else to kill.
[1573.39s -> 1577.38s]  Hmm. I thought that was a crits noise.
[1577.38s -> 1580.10s]  I thought that was a burp.
[1580.10s -> 1581.90s]  I was convinced you burped.
[1581.90s -> 1584.22s]  Maybe you should play spy. You like spy.
[1584.22s -> 1586.22s]  I it's going to be so embarrassing.
[1586.22s -> 1587.78s]  There's no that's like three spot.
[1587.78s -> 1590.34s]  I'll play engineer. Do a stair stab.
[1590.34s -> 1592.70s]  I'm going to play engineer for one specific reason.
[1592.70s -> 1595.30s]  And I don't know if you're going to be very upset with me
[1595.30s -> 1597.18s]  or if you're going to be very happy.
[1597.18s -> 1599.18s]  What's the reason? You'll see.
[1599.18s -> 1604.01s]  Yeah, I have to wait one full minute, though.
[1604.01s -> 1610.40s]  Why? You just you have to wait a minute.
[1610.44s -> 1618.03s]  How's the audio? Is the volume good?
[1618.03s -> 1619.43s]  Doesn't need to be a little bit louder.
[1619.43s -> 1627.14s]  A little quiet. Oh, let me.
[1627.14s -> 1631.06s]  Oh, shit. I didn't want to do that.
[1631.06s -> 1633.06s]  Wait. Oops. OK.
[1633.06s -> 1636.59s]  Options, audio. That's that's neat.
[1636.59s -> 1639.71s]  I remember you're like old hat loadouts.
[1639.71s -> 1642.11s]  You're playing the self-portrait engineer.
[1642.11s -> 1648.22s]  Yeah. Oh, shit. You can't see.
[1648.22s -> 1650.98s]  All right. So this is why I wanted you to.
[1650.98s -> 1652.90s]  You're either going to be very mad or very happy.
[1652.90s -> 1654.66s]  We'll find out really shortly here.
[1654.66s -> 1656.42s]  Oh, no. Wrong one.
[1656.42s -> 1658.10s]  Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. Wrong one.
[1658.10s -> 1661.46s]  You have to for this. No, no, no. Wrong one. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
[1661.46s -> 1669.29s]  This one's important.
[1669.29s -> 1674.89s]  All right, Hank Hill.
[1674.89s -> 1678.83s]  Best of luck to you.
[1678.83s -> 1681.07s]  This is I love this so much.
[1683.85s -> 1686.41s]  You can get backstabbed on the go cart.
[1687.03s -> 1690.19s]  Why not? You have what you have a back.
[1690.19s -> 1694.46s]  Oh, it should hit the fucking metal.
[1694.46s -> 1696.02s]  You know what? I'm changing class.
[1696.02s -> 1697.42s]  I got a better idea.
[1697.42s -> 1698.74s]  I don't want to play engineer.
[1698.74s -> 1700.66s]  I want to play fucking heavy.
[1700.66s -> 1702.82s]  OK, I'm with you.
[1702.82s -> 1704.52s]  All right.
[1704.52s -> 1708.62s]  But we're going to be engineer friends.
[1708.62s -> 1713.40s]  OK. Oh, yeah.
[1713.40s -> 1714.98s]  Where were you?
[1714.98s -> 1717.18s]  I'm I was building a century.
[1717.18s -> 1718.98s]  Are you so that you're I saw you.
[1718.98s -> 1721.14s]  I get the oh, you saw it already.
[1721.14s -> 1724.06s]  I get that you bought every single drivable.
[1724.54s -> 1726.66s]  I can shoot the gun.
[1726.66s -> 1730.07s]  Yeah. What?
[1730.07s -> 1733.57s]  It only has five bullets.
[1733.57s -> 1738.14s]  Wasted them. Pay to win, dude.
[1738.14s -> 1742.64s]  Does this actually hurt people?
[1742.64s -> 1744.82s]  I don't know, actually.
[1744.82s -> 1749.43s]  Hey, it has to, right?
[1749.43s -> 1751.79s]  It doesn't have to buy by.
[1755.66s -> 1760.46s]  Watch your back. He's right here.
[1760.46s -> 1764.57s]  Yeah. Fuck you, buddy.
[1764.57s -> 1772.54s]  That didn't do anything.
[1772.54s -> 1777.88s]  How do I do that?
[1777.88s -> 1781.74s]  It was inevitable.
[1781.74s -> 1788.79s]  All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[1788.79s -> 1790.23s]  You got to go push that cart.
[1790.23s -> 1791.63s]  I would. We could have run for a second.
[1791.63s -> 1795.52s]  Hold on. There's a lot of things going on.
[1795.52s -> 1800.34s]  You got to push that gear up.
[1800.34s -> 1805.37s]  I heard steps.
[1805.37s -> 1806.05s]  I'm doing it.
[1806.05s -> 1807.01s]  I'm really doing it.
[1807.01s -> 1809.73s]  They have a bad ahead of soldier with a conqueror, whatever it is.
[1812.10s -> 1813.90s]  A soldier with a brass beast.
[1813.90s -> 1816.81s]  Excuse me.
[1816.81s -> 1819.85s]  The conch, the conch, whatever it is.
[1819.85s -> 1821.33s]  The soldier with the what?
[1821.33s -> 1824.01s]  The con the shell, the like
[1824.01s -> 1827.14s]  soldier with the what are you talking about?
[1828.95s -> 1832.23s]  Well, let me let me actually take this off.
[1832.23s -> 1833.95s]  I do have some cool items.
[1833.95s -> 1835.07s]  I love the Thomas love.
[1835.07s -> 1837.75s]  It was awesome.
[1837.75s -> 1843.50s]  Nana. 50 percent.
[1843.50s -> 1844.78s]  Yeah. For those of you that don't know,
[1844.78s -> 1847.50s]  Team Fortress 2 has like five thousand items that are different
[1847.50s -> 1848.98s]  and can't change the gameplay there.
[1848.98s -> 1850.46s]  They are all different now.
[1850.46s -> 1853.26s]  Everyone that you remember that was fun is different now.
[1853.34s -> 1855.78s]  Really? Yes.
[1855.78s -> 1857.14s]  So much stuff changed.
[1857.14s -> 1858.78s]  Oh, my God.
[1858.78s -> 1861.63s]  Wait, is this 40 percent?
[1861.63s -> 1862.71s]  I might have to take a whole stream
[1862.71s -> 1865.15s]  just sitting here looking at every item that might have to happen later.
[1866.03s -> 1868.59s]  Tell me which one you put on and I'll tell you if it was.
[1868.71s -> 1871.44s]  OK. Gloves of running urgently.
[1871.44s -> 1873.20s]  I think those are still the same.
[1873.20s -> 1874.36s]  Are they the same?
[1874.36s -> 1875.92s]  I haven't actually played like no heavy.
[1875.92s -> 1878.16s]  Don't ask me about any heavy items. Never mind.
[1878.16s -> 1880.91s]  Is this live? Yeah, it's live.
[1880.91s -> 1882.15s]  It's late night live.
[1882.15s -> 1884.55s]  This is late night live commentary.
[1884.55s -> 1892.79s]  My hit series. What are you doing?
[1892.79s -> 1894.78s]  What are you doing?
[1894.78s -> 1896.42s]  Yeah, that Tommy's love is much quicker.
[1896.42s -> 1897.86s]  All right. Let's actually I'm going I'm going for it now.
[1897.86s -> 1898.90s]  I'm going for it. No more fucking around.
[1898.90s -> 1902.82s]  No more. Oh, man.
[1902.82s -> 1905.82s]  I picked the only time that our team had was not pushing.
[1908.27s -> 1909.94s]  And I leave.
[1909.94s -> 1911.38s]  What do we actually need?
[1911.38s -> 1914.14s]  Why should we need?
[1914.30s -> 1916.98s]  Maybe demo. Yeah.
[1916.98s -> 1918.30s]  What do we what's my I'm sorry.
[1918.30s -> 1919.58s]  I'm just all over the place.
[1919.58s -> 1923.06s]  That's overwhelming. I forget everything.
[1923.06s -> 1926.47s]  Loose cannon was cool. Is that different?
[1926.47s -> 1929.35s]  Uh, no. I'll keep.
[1929.35s -> 1931.73s]  All right. I'm going to do loose cannon.
[1931.73s -> 1933.17s]  What about the shield of the shields?
[1933.17s -> 1936.21s]  Any better or different or anything?
[1936.21s -> 1940.81s]  Tied Turner makes you go anywhere.
[1940.81s -> 1942.45s]  This one's just defense.
[1942.45s -> 1943.77s]  I'm going to just do defense.
[1943.77s -> 1947.22s]  And the donk whatever it is, bonk whatever it is.
[1949.89s -> 1951.61s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[1951.61s -> 1953.61s]  All my stuff's getting sapped, bro.
[1953.85s -> 1956.88s]  Oh, shit.
[1956.88s -> 1958.88s]  Teleporter down.
[1958.88s -> 1960.68s]  It all went to shit.
[1960.68s -> 1961.08s]  That's all right.
[1961.08s -> 1962.72s]  I'm playing one of my favorite items in the game.
[1962.72s -> 1972.36s]  Everything is about to change for our in our favor.
[1972.36s -> 1975.46s]  Just get the game behind us.
[1975.46s -> 1979.65s]  I'm aware. I'm going to kill this guy.
[1979.65s -> 1984.07s]  Oh, I give up.
[1984.07s -> 1985.15s]  Don't give up.
[1985.15s -> 1987.75s]  I give up on engineer.
[1987.75s -> 1992.35s]  I'm going to go back to spawn and get in the little car.
[1992.35s -> 1997.66s]  Oh, my God. Never back down.
[1997.66s -> 2002.30s]  Yeah, never back down.
[2002.30s -> 2007.38s]  So the loose cannon is you have to hit them twice,
[2007.38s -> 2009.46s]  once with the directed and then once with the explosion, right?
[2009.46s -> 2011.06s]  That's how I remember.
[2011.06s -> 2013.62s]  Mm hmm. If you charge it up all the way, you blow yourself up.
[2013.62s -> 2015.82s]  Don't do that. People are going to do omega lols.
[2015.82s -> 2019.18s]  They I mean, I did definitely omega loling the whole time since I opened the game.
[2020.84s -> 2024.52s]  That's why. Well, I'm glad they're having a good time.
[2026.05s -> 2034.88s]  Oh, oh, omega lol.
[2036.19s -> 2041.29s]  I do have a hit sound, I guess you have a hit sound.
[2041.69s -> 2046.47s]  Yeah. You didn't even ask me for like a hit sound.
[2046.47s -> 2047.43s]  No, I do.
[2047.43s -> 2050.31s]  I installed a custom HUD for the first time forever.
[2050.79s -> 2052.79s]  We would have sat there for like three hours while you tried to explain.
[2052.79s -> 2057.24s]  Holder in one spot. Oh, I'm the soldier going around.
[2057.24s -> 2058.76s]  It's not too late, Jerma.
[2058.76s -> 2060.68s]  I can give you a hit sound. You're going to love it.
[2060.68s -> 2063.51s]  See if I can get this done.
[2063.51s -> 2064.63s]  Oh, I can't take this thing.
[2064.63s -> 2066.43s]  Oh, no. Wait, why can I shoot this?
[2066.47s -> 2067.55s]  Thought I couldn't.
[2082.09s -> 2091.67s]  The crits. Let's go.
[2091.67s -> 2092.71s]  That was a good crits, too.
[2092.71s -> 2095.70s]  That was like almost everybody.
[2095.70s -> 2098.98s]  They're proud of you.
[2098.98s -> 2100.72s]  Oh, we're so back.
[2100.72s -> 2105.62s]  We're so back. Oh, I'm having I'm having fun.
[2106.30s -> 2109.10s]  Oh, I'm. Are you not having fun?
[2109.50s -> 2110.82s]  I am having fun.
[2110.82s -> 2114.26s]  I just find it funny that
[2114.26s -> 2117.10s]  I'm having fun is code word for what's next.
[2118.82s -> 2125.22s]  You know, it's funny to say.
[2125.26s -> 2128.30s]  I mean, I've been playing this for like a week.
[2128.30s -> 2136.97s]  Hold on. Oh, shit.
[2136.97s -> 2141.86s]  I'm good. All right.
[2141.86s -> 2144.14s]  So if you don't know what's going on there, that weapon.
[2146.23s -> 2148.15s]  Dude, there's a lot of people here.
[2148.15s -> 2149.23s]  We this is a business.
[2149.23s -> 2152.07s]  This game is like our entire you and I.
[2152.67s -> 2154.31s]  Can you explain what a spie is?
[2154.31s -> 2159.08s]  You and I are like entire lives are because this game exists.
[2159.20s -> 2160.44s]  You know, you understand.
[2160.44s -> 2162.89s]  We need to make sure people understand this.
[2162.89s -> 2168.55s]  OK, so this thing, when you get a kill with it, you get healed.
[2168.95s -> 2171.55s]  You get healed 50 percent of your health.
[2171.55s -> 2175.36s]  But what? I had a mo.
[2175.36s -> 2178.41s]  I'm sorry. That has nothing to do with you.
[2178.41s -> 2181.45s]  So but if I take this out and I don't kill someone,
[2181.45s -> 2182.53s]  this is completely different.
[2182.53s -> 2184.90s]  I don't understand how this item works anymore.
[2184.90s -> 2188.19s]  Which item? The the toy.
[2188.19s -> 2189.69s]  You can't put it away.
[2189.69s -> 2191.13s]  No, you will heal if you kill someone.
[2191.13s -> 2194.81s]  No, no, no, you're not. It's different.
[2194.81s -> 2198.09s]  No. OK, so you get 50 percent base health if you kill somebody.
[2198.45s -> 2200.05s]  There are no random crits.
[2200.05s -> 2203.05s]  And once you draw this thing, if you put it away,
[2203.05s -> 2205.90s]  you get hurt for 50 damage unless you kill somebody.
[2205.90s -> 2207.94s]  Oh, OK. That's interesting.
[2207.94s -> 2210.22s]  Yeah. Most things have changed.
[2210.22s -> 2211.66s]  I actually like that better.
[2211.66s -> 2217.72s]  Hold on. Let me see. Oh, wow.
[2217.72s -> 2219.40s]  Oh, shit. Maybe that's why I was getting hurt.
[2219.40s -> 2220.68s]  I didn't even know that was happening.
[2220.68s -> 2222.80s]  Were you just weapon swapping it? I think so.
[2222.80s -> 2232.46s]  Yeah. I'll do it.
[2232.46s -> 2237.78s]  I'll get my contract going or get five kills as a demo in a single life.
[2238.30s -> 2240.86s]  Press F2. Why?
[2240.86s -> 2244.78s]  If you if you want to hack, I just want you to see this menu.
[2245.26s -> 2247.30s]  OK, F2. Hold on.
[2247.30s -> 2249.28s]  I'll do what I'm good.
[2249.32s -> 2252.28s]  This is the Deus Ex fucking screen.
[2260.37s -> 2262.61s]  What the fuck? How is he still alive?
[2263.79s -> 2265.39s]  What does a crit do with the melee?
[2265.39s -> 2268.31s]  Don't say swears.
[2268.31s -> 2271.58s]  All right. Press F2 to open up the contract menu.
[2272.14s -> 2274.69s]  Yeah. OK. Yeah.
[2274.69s -> 2277.85s]  I mean, I did a lot of this when it was relevant, like 10 years ago.
[2278.87s -> 2280.59s]  It didn't exist 10 years ago.
[2280.59s -> 2282.84s]  How long? Yeah, this is like five years ago.
[2282.84s -> 2285.42s]  Eight years. It was a long time ago.
[2285.42s -> 2288.78s]  They changed it to that during the jungle inferno update, like two years ago.
[2290.28s -> 2293.86s]  I must have played for like an hour.
[2293.86s -> 2296.14s]  Oh, yeah, I never saw that before. Did I play?
[2296.78s -> 2297.86s]  Yeah, I did.
[2297.86s -> 2299.42s]  When was jungle inferno, guys?
[2299.42s -> 2301.54s]  It was not five years ago. It's two years ago.
[2304.38s -> 2306.66s]  There's been so many updates this game. It's hard to keep track.
[2307.51s -> 2311.58s]  He was playing off stream.
[2311.58s -> 2314.46s]  And I played this game for a little bit like two or three years ago.
[2314.86s -> 2317.78s]  I must have. No, I did.
[2317.78s -> 2320.44s]  I did. I did very briefly.
[2320.44s -> 2322.00s]  But like maybe a day or two.
[2322.00s -> 2326.16s]  But I immediately dropped it because it was just kind of fucking fucked up.
[2326.66s -> 2328.78s]  Jungle Inferno was 2017.
[2328.78s -> 2330.22s]  Yeah, that was two years ago.
[2330.22s -> 2331.62s]  That's right. Two years ago.
[2331.62s -> 2333.86s]  That was to 2017.
[2335.41s -> 2337.73s]  Yeah, it sounds like two years a long time ago.
[2337.73s -> 2343.04s]  It's like 2018 now.
[2343.04s -> 2347.34s]  Somebody said, hey, dude, is your mouse on gravel?
[2347.34s -> 2349.47s]  What do you mean?
[2349.47s -> 2352.07s]  You mean like like a mouse pad of rocks?
[2355.74s -> 2364.73s]  Maybe my sensitivity is too high.
[2364.73s -> 2370.51s]  Pyros exist. It feels like I give up.
[2370.51s -> 2372.72s]  Bye. Behind.
[2372.72s -> 2375.30s]  Well, he just fucked everybody up.
[2375.30s -> 2379.70s]  I made the call out to and they didn't hear you.
[2387.09s -> 2388.56s]  Oh, I'm in trouble.
[2388.56s -> 2391.28s]  I'm I'm getting ready to use the schwicky swag.
[2391.88s -> 2393.38s]  I'm not doing bad.
[2393.38s -> 2394.70s]  I mean, I got 53 points.
[2394.70s -> 2399.18s]  That's like doing pretty good.
[2399.18s -> 2403.04s]  All right, let's do engineer engineer with the mini century.
[2403.88s -> 2407.58s]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let's go.
[2407.58s -> 2411.27s]  OK, I want to do this.
[2411.27s -> 2414.06s]  Get a teleport. Yep.
[2414.06s -> 2417.58s]  Teleport. Teleport going up.
[2417.58s -> 2419.62s]  Do not get backstabbed.
[2419.62s -> 2425.06s]  What if I want to?
[2425.06s -> 2430.12s]  Well, well, well, help.
[2430.12s -> 2431.60s]  I'm on fire. I need a dispenser.
[2431.60s -> 2433.28s]  Help. Help.
[2433.28s -> 2434.44s]  What a dispenser.
[2434.44s -> 2443.45s]  Get out of the dispenser. Get out of the way.
[2443.45s -> 2444.37s]  Wait, was it you?
[2444.37s -> 2446.45s]  Oh, I think I was being OK.
[2446.45s -> 2449.40s]  I was a sniper asking for help.
[2452.12s -> 2454.44s]  Help level this dispenser up.
[2454.68s -> 2457.08s]  I only have 55 mana.
[2460.07s -> 2463.93s]  Where's the ammo on this map?
[2463.93s -> 2466.97s]  This guy thinks he's playing World of Warcraft.
[2472.19s -> 2474.31s]  Look at this. We have like a little nest over here.
[2474.31s -> 2481.82s]  Perfect. Lay down the rug.
[2481.82s -> 2483.98s]  Always help. Always help your fellow engineer.
[2484.50s -> 2486.18s]  Everyone's just going to be over there helping you.
[2486.18s -> 2489.30s]  There is no one else playing the game right now.
[2489.30s -> 2496.14s]  Oh, my God.
[2496.14s -> 2497.14s]  Oh, I got two kills with this thing.
[2497.14s -> 2498.82s]  Holy shit. That means I get crits with it.
[2498.82s -> 2502.42s]  The only thing I care about when playing as engineer is the frontier justice.
[2503.91s -> 2507.74s]  Oh, oh, oh, that's why it's fun.
[2507.74s -> 2508.90s]  It's probably going to try to tell somebody.
[2508.90s -> 2512.00s]  I killed them, killed them.
[2512.00s -> 2516.90s]  But you got one of the teleporters.
[2516.90s -> 2519.10s]  All right. Now this is where I go and fuck somebody up.
[2531.24s -> 2539.10s]  All right. I'm happy with it.
[2539.10s -> 2545.02s]  I'm happy with it. Is this all the way it is all the way?
[2550.22s -> 2552.38s]  All right. We're all good.
[2552.38s -> 2555.66s]  No one's going to be fucking around over here.
[2555.66s -> 2558.42s]  Are you sure about that?
[2558.42s -> 2560.66s]  I don't know. Oh, bye.
[2560.66s -> 2564.18s]  He's at the spawn.
[2564.18s -> 2565.62s]  My own shit got in the way.
[2565.62s -> 2567.81s]  God damn it.
[2567.81s -> 2570.17s]  Yeah, it's going to be hard keeping that up.
[2570.17s -> 2576.71s]  He's dedicated to his craft.
[2576.71s -> 2579.07s]  All right. All right. That's fine.
[2579.07s -> 2582.66s]  Let's go, bud.
[2582.66s -> 2585.24s]  Got him.
[2589.22s -> 2590.62s]  Was that you?
[2590.62s -> 2593.89s]  What? The velociraptor in the call.
[2594.85s -> 2599.35s]  Oh, spy spy's coming for you next.
[2599.35s -> 2601.38s]  Spy's coming for next.
[2601.38s -> 2603.37s]  Back at spawn.
[2603.37s -> 2605.33s]  Now, the dispensers, did they all get destroyed?
[2606.41s -> 2612.79s]  My dispensers there.
[2612.79s -> 2616.24s]  I'm trying to get the teleporter back up.
[2616.24s -> 2618.36s]  Somebody is at the dispenser right now.
[2618.36s -> 2622.46s]  Let me tell a frag him.
[2623.46s -> 2629.90s]  We're trying. Oh, fuck.
[2629.90s -> 2637.61s]  This is bad.
[2637.61s -> 2639.25s]  We're going to get this thing a little free.
[2639.25s -> 2643.65s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[2643.65s -> 2649.54s]  But I'm just trying to have a decoy.
[2649.54s -> 2650.58s]  Yeah, good, good.
[2650.58s -> 2654.07s]  Exactly what I wanted.
[2654.07s -> 2655.03s]  Exactly what I wanted.
[2655.03s -> 2657.55s]  They killed the mini sentry like three times.
[2658.82s -> 2662.74s]  They didn't even go for the big one.
[2662.74s -> 2665.76s]  Those fools.
[2665.76s -> 2666.60s]  Change your hit sound.
[2666.60s -> 2669.89s]  My hit sound is like a squishy sound.
[2673.47s -> 2675.47s]  Change it. Change your hit sound.
[2675.47s -> 2677.15s]  Change your view model.
[2677.15s -> 2679.03s]  Change your sentry to me.
[2679.03s -> 2683.63s]  Change your loadout. Equip the pen.
[2683.63s -> 2684.83s]  Jerma, equip the pen.
[2684.83s -> 2686.95s]  Oh, did you say pan?
[2686.95s -> 2687.87s]  Equip the pen.
[2687.87s -> 2690.27s]  You talk about the pan like the pen.
[2690.27s -> 2693.35s]  Why do you keep saying pen?
[2693.35s -> 2701.01s]  Equip the pen.
[2701.01s -> 2714.30s]  I like to be annoying with the pistol.
[2714.30s -> 2715.50s]  Equip the pen.
[2715.50s -> 2720.37s]  Oh, shit. Sorry, he's going to die.
[2720.37s -> 2721.69s]  What is the why do you keep saying that?
[2721.69s -> 2723.89s]  What is that? What's the pen?
[2723.89s -> 2728.46s]  Um, that's it.
[2728.46s -> 2731.44s]  There's really not much more to it.
[2731.44s -> 2735.61s]  Come on, we can do it.
[2735.61s -> 2736.90s]  Over time.
[2736.90s -> 2738.76s]  All right, get in there. Get in there.
[2738.76s -> 2739.76s]  Get in there.
[2742.56s -> 2746.08s]  This last point is really hard because there's always a million sentries
[2746.12s -> 2749.43s]  at a perfect angle.
[2749.43s -> 2750.71s]  Wait, no.
[2750.71s -> 2752.71s]  We're just losers. Losers.
[2752.71s -> 2755.47s]  That's why he has 83 points and he's playing with a track pad.
[2756.66s -> 2757.70s]  He's lying.
[2757.70s -> 2758.70s]  You sure?
[2758.70s -> 2760.58s]  Yeah, I'm sure. Where do you want to go?
[2760.58s -> 2761.98s]  This is where you leave.
[2761.98s -> 2763.34s]  This is where you leave.
[2763.34s -> 2765.78s]  Yeah, this is where you 100 percent leave the game.
[2765.78s -> 2767.74s]  OK, because nobody is going to stay.
[2767.74s -> 2770.02s]  And I told you this and we discussed this.
[2770.02s -> 2772.43s]  OK, do you want the new maps now?
[2772.43s -> 2774.23s]  I'll put some of the. Sure.
[2774.23s -> 2782.38s]  The good or new maps on.
[2782.38s -> 2784.89s]  Let me look at Medic.
[2784.93s -> 2787.78s]  They add, OK, the Vaccinator.
[2787.78s -> 2789.94s]  This one was weird at the very get go.
[2789.94s -> 2792.85s]  I wonder if they changed it.
[2792.85s -> 2793.97s]  I don't think so.
[2793.97s -> 2797.05s]  And it is still weird.
[2797.05s -> 2799.48s]  A crazy Uber charge rate.
[2799.48s -> 2803.86s]  You press your reload key to cycle through resist types
[2803.86s -> 2806.78s]  while healing provides you and your target with a constant 10 percent
[2806.78s -> 2811.30s]  resistance to the selected damage type.
[2811.30s -> 2814.02s]  The Uber charge provides a two and a half second resistance bubble
[2814.02s -> 2816.54s]  that blocks 75 percent base damage and 100 percent crit damage.
[2818.26s -> 2819.90s]  It's like we're playing D4.
[2819.90s -> 2822.53s]  It's a Diablo four item.
[2822.53s -> 2824.01s]  And what does this say? I just picked up a sign.
[2824.01s -> 2826.77s]  And what does it do?
[2826.77s -> 2830.53s]  OK, minus 66 percent overheal, whatever.
[2832.24s -> 2834.16s]  You have to switch it between things.
[2834.16s -> 2838.36s]  So it requires more buttons.
[2838.36s -> 2841.72s]  So like when when a pyro is coming, you have to switch it to fire resistance.
[2845.48s -> 2848.89s]  I wonder, was that any better than the quick fix?
[2851.49s -> 2855.69s]  Um, situationally, maybe to like anti crits.
[2855.69s -> 2856.77s]  If you know somebody has a crits creed.
[2856.77s -> 2857.97s]  But why wouldn't you just use the Uber?
[2857.97s -> 2859.37s]  I guess it's faster.
[2859.37s -> 2861.65s]  Crit would probably kill someone with a vaccinator.
[2861.97s -> 2864.32s]  No, it's 100 percent.
[2865.28s -> 2870.56s]  When you Uber, you block 100 percent crit damage of the selected type.
[2871.47s -> 2873.51s]  That might be new, then it may be new.
[2877.58s -> 2879.66s]  Vaccinator is OP if you get good with it.
[2881.30s -> 2882.58s]  It is very strong.
[2882.58s -> 2885.02s]  Like if a pyro is walking in and you switch to fire damage,
[2885.02s -> 2888.38s]  it they'll they just start doing like one every hit.
[2889.14s -> 2891.30s]  You just outheal any damage they can do.
[2891.38s -> 2894.22s]  Well, I missed the entire Uber build period, so that's bad.
[2897.64s -> 2899.00s]  My phone needs it.
[2899.00s -> 2900.52s]  Oh, this is nice. This map school.
[2900.52s -> 2903.33s]  Oh, I like this a lot.
[2903.33s -> 2908.46s]  It's like water spike.
[2910.46s -> 2912.26s]  God damn it, I taste a spike.
[2912.78s -> 2915.94s]  It's great to hear you having the takes that I also had a week ago
[2916.06s -> 2918.42s]  and how how quickly they've changed.
[2918.99s -> 2923.54s]  Really? So you don't like this map is cursed.
[2924.50s -> 2927.26s]  This map is not one that you want to play on, even though you had the same.
[2927.50s -> 2929.26s]  I do want to play on it.
[2929.26s -> 2931.94s]  I want you to experience it.
[2931.94s -> 2935.10s]  Everything bad that could possibly happen to you is going to happen
[2935.10s -> 2937.73s]  because like this map is haunted.
[2937.73s -> 2940.67s]  What? There's ghosts on this map.
[2940.95s -> 2943.31s]  Wait, there are you mean that?
[2943.31s -> 2946.35s]  Or is it like you just like around like in the program ghost?
[2946.35s -> 2948.23s]  Not like, oh, I'm going to see a cute little girl.
[2948.23s -> 2952.03s]  No, like in the program, someone died on this map while making it.
[2952.03s -> 2954.39s]  And there's ghosts on this map and it's haunted.
[2954.39s -> 2955.92s]  Wait, what?
[2955.92s -> 2959.64s]  You'll see by the end of this map.
[2959.64s -> 2961.46s]  You're going to like, no, I get what he meant.
[2961.46s -> 2963.78s]  I don't I don't. I have no idea what that means.
[2963.78s -> 2966.62s]  But are you going to like a haunted house and like all the spooky stuff
[2966.62s -> 2969.62s]  starts happening and things start going badly for you by demo?
[2970.15s -> 2974.45s]  That's Venice. Venice is haunted.
[2974.45s -> 2981.52s]  Oh, OK. That's by two. Who knows what somebody in the chat
[2981.52s -> 2983.44s]  just write their type in all caps.
[2983.44s -> 2986.12s]  Get your fucking beam on that heavy.
[2989.29s -> 2990.37s]  Oh, that was bad.
[2990.37s -> 2995.03s]  That was a bad crack, but it's OK.
[2995.03s -> 2996.43s]  You know, don't say swears.
[2996.43s -> 2998.59s]  We don't have very many hourglass, do we?
[3000.36s -> 3004.59s]  There's one demo.
[3004.59s -> 3006.75s]  I've seen a lot of spies, a lot of snipers.
[3013.50s -> 3014.82s]  What do you want us to?
[3014.82s -> 3015.98s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3015.98s -> 3018.78s]  Oh, I don't.
[3018.78s -> 3021.82s]  This is three pyros, two scouts.
[3023.98s -> 3025.90s]  Are things not going well right now?
[3025.90s -> 3028.26s]  Is that what you're suggesting?
[3028.26s -> 3032.22s]  Not necessarily.
[3032.22s -> 3033.38s]  Yeah, I use cow mangler.
[3033.38s -> 3035.81s]  There it is. The conk.
[3035.81s -> 3041.06s]  The what? The conqueror.
[3041.06s -> 3042.46s]  I don't even know how to fucking be a good teammate.
[3042.46s -> 3048.53s]  I'll show you.
[3048.53s -> 3056.24s]  Especially to the engineers with the holding shit.
[3056.24s -> 3061.53s]  I don't know where we're going into the haunted mansion.
[3064.27s -> 3065.79s]  Am I going away from the.
[3065.79s -> 3069.32s]  Wait, there's usually arrows on the team fortress.
[3069.32s -> 3070.88s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3070.88s -> 3072.20s]  Wrong way. Wrong way. What's he doing?
[3072.20s -> 3074.80s]  What's he doing? Get that fucking beam on that heavy.
[3078.56s -> 3086.58s]  It's a big map.
[3086.58s -> 3088.18s]  Who thought spy was a good idea?
[3088.18s -> 3089.86s]  This map haunted.
[3089.86s -> 3093.05s]  No, this map is haunted.
[3093.05s -> 3099.78s]  Are you just not very good?
[3099.78s -> 3102.00s]  Do you think ghosts are real?
[3102.00s -> 3103.90s]  That's a whole can of worms.
[3103.90s -> 3104.90s]  Answer them.
[3104.90s -> 3107.10s]  Um, I mean, not necessarily.
[3107.38s -> 3110.94s]  I think there's a possibility there could be some phantoms.
[3111.26s -> 3113.10s]  I feel like that was a yes or no question,
[3113.10s -> 3115.82s]  and you cannot answer it with not necessarily.
[3120.24s -> 3122.36s]  Oh, my God. Oh, how did I miss everybody?
[3122.36s -> 3127.66s]  Did it hit the wall?
[3127.66s -> 3129.22s]  There it is. What?
[3129.22s -> 3130.26s]  Dude, I got the conqueror.
[3130.26s -> 3131.30s]  I got the conqueror. I got the conqueror.
[3131.30s -> 3134.05s]  I got the conqueror. You got the what?
[3134.05s -> 3135.61s]  I have to stop doing that.
[3135.61s -> 3136.85s]  It's not even funny.
[3136.85s -> 3139.01s]  All right, let's go. Where are you?
[3139.01s -> 3141.81s]  I thought I knew that was a spy, too.
[3141.81s -> 3144.93s]  You just stop muting and centering my words.
[3145.33s -> 3149.67s]  You're about to put your lips on it.
[3149.67s -> 3151.83s]  He's fucking with me and messing up my video game.
[3158.89s -> 3161.05s]  Was I messing with you? They're ghost real.
[3162.25s -> 3164.01s]  They might. I don't know.
[3164.01s -> 3166.53s]  How am I supposed to know?
[3166.53s -> 3169.73s]  Because like once you reach a certain level of status in society,
[3169.73s -> 3173.09s]  don't you like get invited to these events where like the president's there
[3173.09s -> 3175.41s]  and he's like, oh, he's like, tells you all this shit about ghosts.
[3175.61s -> 3177.37s]  Or you're in a party and there's like all actors
[3177.37s -> 3179.81s]  and they all like have the same.
[3179.81s -> 3181.73s]  What do they call it? What do they call it?
[3181.73s -> 3186.81s]  Sir, it's been nine days since I've left my home.
[3188.11s -> 3189.43s]  What are you talking about?
[3189.47s -> 3192.07s]  Again, I think I'm going to get invited to like fucking special events.
[3192.07s -> 3193.79s]  Are you is that what you're implying?
[3193.79s -> 3195.51s]  Well, you went to like the streamer awards.
[3195.51s -> 3198.69s]  There wasn't like an Illuminati there.
[3201.32s -> 3204.04s]  Yeah, we talk about aliens and ghosts and shit.
[3204.04s -> 3207.00s]  Oh, yeah, I'm expecting to get 10K more subs this week.
[3207.00s -> 3208.80s]  Yeah, because my yeah, I found a good ghost.
[3208.80s -> 3210.32s]  I got a poltergeist. We were doing an exercise.
[3210.32s -> 3213.04s]  You didn't hear any conversation like that.
[3213.04s -> 3214.12s]  Hold on. This is important.
[3214.12s -> 3216.88s]  I got I got to get a cow mangler here.
[3216.88s -> 3219.84s]  I have an opportunity to help the fucking team.
[3219.84s -> 3221.04s]  OK, what was your question?
[3221.36s -> 3224.40s]  Do all the do all the streamers talk about like ghosts
[3224.40s -> 3225.56s]  and conspiracies and stuff?
[3225.56s -> 3225.96s]  Is that what you said?
[3225.96s -> 3229.16s]  I want to know that you're not necessarily.
[3229.16s -> 3230.68s]  And you said it's a whole can of worms.
[3230.68s -> 3232.76s]  And now your ghost answer is I don't know.
[3232.76s -> 3236.04s]  Well, because we evolved from I was interested to what you had to say to
[3236.28s -> 3241.32s]  you lost me because that's a very loaded question.
[3242.04s -> 3244.72s]  That that's like an hour and a half long conversation.
[3245.76s -> 3246.76s]  Do you not want to have it?
[3246.76s -> 3248.52s]  You're going to not play this game that long.
[3248.52s -> 3250.40s]  I'm currently enjoying Team Fortress.
[3250.96s -> 3252.80s]  And ever since we started talking about this,
[3252.80s -> 3255.28s]  but my skill level has dropped by like at least 30 percent.
[3255.64s -> 3257.96s]  Do you want to know why your skill level drop?
[3257.96s -> 3258.72s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3258.72s -> 3261.12s]  I was doing fine until we started talking about fucking aliens and ghosts.
[3261.12s -> 3263.88s]  Until we came to Venice.
[3268.38s -> 3275.92s]  TLDR. What?
[3275.92s -> 3278.32s]  It missed him. You got to be shitting me.
[3279.84s -> 3281.96s]  Oh, my God. How does it matter that miss?
[3282.72s -> 3284.80s]  That thing has a gigantic explosion radius.
[3288.72s -> 3291.04s]  OK, I got to step it up here. I'm not doing very well.
[3293.01s -> 3294.93s]  And to play the worst possible thing I could play
[3297.93s -> 3301.09s]  and play spy with the Spicycle and the
[3302.82s -> 3305.05s]  is the load out here.
[3305.05s -> 3308.69s]  I forget how you play spy the default revolver because the ambassador was
[3308.69s -> 3311.01s]  nerfed and the enforcer was nerfed.
[3311.01s -> 3313.21s]  And like every spy equipment has been nerfed.
[3313.21s -> 3322.66s]  The dead bringers been nerfed.
[3322.66s -> 3329.45s]  Oh, my. I had the Spicycle. That was a mistake.
[3329.45s -> 3335.72s]  Yeah, it should not.
[3336.04s -> 3339.66s]  That should not have happened.
[3339.66s -> 3341.14s]  Why do you think it happened?
[3341.14s -> 3343.22s]  I don't know, but there's a fucking scout over here.
[3343.22s -> 3345.65s]  I need help. Blue Team, help me.
[3345.65s -> 3348.02s]  He's getting me help.
[3348.02s -> 3353.99s]  Oh, are you fucking kidding me?
[3353.99s -> 3356.79s]  What happened? Oh, he's using the crossbow.
[3357.03s -> 3360.66s]  I thought he was I thought he was stream sniping.
[3360.66s -> 3362.26s]  He's using the
[3368.60s -> 3372.08s]  I was calling for medic as a spy and this guy
[3372.88s -> 3375.44s]  he kills me with the crossbow.
[3375.44s -> 3379.50s]  OK, kind of spooky.
[3379.54s -> 3396.45s]  That was fucking funny.
[3396.45s -> 3401.44s]  Medic, medic, medic.
[3403.26s -> 3404.90s]  I'm not I'm a real person.
[3404.90s -> 3411.65s]  Oh, what's that thing?
[3411.65s -> 3412.25s]  That was cool.
[3412.25s -> 3414.49s]  Did you did you know they made the Liberty launcher
[3414.49s -> 3416.86s]  the best weapon in the whole game?
[3416.86s -> 3419.12s]  What do you mean?
[3419.12s -> 3420.40s]  That's just flat out.
[3420.40s -> 3421.92s]  They they buffed the Liberty launcher.
[3421.92s -> 3423.98s]  It's the best weapon in the whole game now.
[3423.98s -> 3425.90s]  What was different before?
[3425.90s -> 3426.82s]  Is it the blast damage?
[3426.82s -> 3428.98s]  It's had like three different changes.
[3428.98s -> 3431.30s]  They removed a lot of the downsides.
[3431.30s -> 3433.98s]  I mean, 25% penalty is actually pretty bad considering.
[3434.70s -> 3438.14s]  And it's really not because you get an extra rocket and extra projectile speed
[3438.14s -> 3442.08s]  that makes up for the consistency on the why don't I just use the stupid thing
[3442.08s -> 3447.02s]  damage the what thing the the sneeze gun?
[3448.88s -> 3450.73s]  I don't know. Do it.
[3450.73s -> 3453.38s]  OK, you can only hold three.
[3453.38s -> 3456.33s]  No matter what you do, it's not going to go well.
[3456.33s -> 3458.21s]  And that's not I'm not being mean.
[3458.21s -> 3459.37s]  That went pretty well.
[3459.37s -> 3474.18s]  It's just Venice.
[3474.18s -> 3476.06s]  I'm out of ammo already.
[3476.06s -> 3478.06s]  Oh, you hold them.
[3478.06s -> 3479.34s]  That is actually scared the shit out of me.
[3479.34s -> 3485.50s]  I thought something happened.
[3485.50s -> 3489.14s]  I need ammo with ammo on this map like everywhere.
[3489.62s -> 3490.62s]  I better not fucking die.
[3490.62s -> 3495.21s]  I swear to God.
[3495.25s -> 3499.58s]  Oh, there we go.
[3499.58s -> 3502.34s]  I, I almost got the conch and then we can really go for it.
[3503.26s -> 3512.44s]  But what that item that's on soldier, the Liberty Lauchers.
[3512.44s -> 3517.16s]  Let's go.
[3517.16s -> 3521.34s]  Well, let's get them.
[3521.34s -> 3525.10s]  Oh, it's all right.
[3525.10s -> 3527.46s]  I think you would have killed him if you had the Liberty launcher.
[3527.46s -> 3530.86s]  I don't think so.
[3530.86s -> 3533.21s]  Oh, you had an extra rocket?
[3533.21s -> 3535.14s]  This just makes sense.
[3535.14s -> 3539.91s]  And you would miss less because it goes faster.
[3539.91s -> 3544.38s]  I'm using this fucking weird thing.
[3544.38s -> 3548.38s]  Those of you that don't know, Team Fortress Classic is also one of my favorite games of all time.
[3548.94s -> 3551.71s]  And I use this weapon all the time.
[3551.71s -> 3555.19s]  Classic is you have to hold the button down and then release it to shoot.
[3555.19s -> 3557.15s]  A lot of people say trash item.
[3557.15s -> 3557.89s]  Fucking terrible.
[3557.89s -> 3559.89s]  Just wait till you see somebody that knows what they're doing with it,
[3559.89s -> 3561.89s]  and then you can fucking go talk about it.
[3567.02s -> 3570.37s]  It's the trash item.
[3570.37s -> 3572.51s]  I was scrolling through my old TF2 videos the other day,
[3572.83s -> 3575.95s]  and even my description of the video I made about the classic was like,
[3576.21s -> 3577.47s]  why would you do this?
[3577.47s -> 3579.67s]  Just get the ambassador and be invisible with it.
[3583.44s -> 3585.12s]  We'll see.
[3585.12s -> 3585.88s]  We will see.
[3585.88s -> 3587.58s]  It doesn't make people pop when you kill them.
[3587.58s -> 3588.38s]  That's neat.
[3588.38s -> 3596.84s]  It is pretty neat.
[3596.84s -> 3605.07s]  Oh, fuck.
[3605.07s -> 3607.05s]  He's terrible.
[3607.05s -> 3610.85s]  A scout versus a sniper is an automatic loss for the sniper.
[3611.45s -> 3613.35s]  Don't you kidding me?
[3613.35s -> 3614.65s]  You're digging yourself in deeper.
[3614.65s -> 3619.16s]  Are you kidding me?
[3619.16s -> 3621.10s]  Guys, he's not bad.
[3621.10s -> 3631.16s]  Venice is haunted.
[3631.16s -> 3632.80s]  Where are they? Where do they even come from?
[3632.80s -> 3633.60s]  Where's the enemies?
[3633.60s -> 3638.97s]  Where's their like spawn in the shadow realm?
[3640.25s -> 3653.03s]  Don't think about it.
[3653.03s -> 3656.94s]  My sensitivity is too high.
[3656.94s -> 3662.20s]  I got to drop it by like at least 10 percent.
[3662.20s -> 3664.94s]  Yeah, way, way, way too high, way too high.
[3664.94s -> 3667.84s]  Like outrageously high.
[3667.84s -> 3670.34s]  What is it at right now?
[3670.34s -> 3671.90s]  No, I don't want it at zero.
[3671.90s -> 3675.80s]  One point five.
[3675.80s -> 3680.80s]  That's better. OK.
[3680.80s -> 3682.30s]  Oh, you got to be ready for the pub push.
[3682.30s -> 3685.39s]  You got to be ready for the pub push, Jerma.
[3685.39s -> 3689.17s]  Five seconds, 10 seconds, 12 seconds, 11 seconds, two seconds.
[3689.41s -> 3696.22s]  You got to be ready, Jerma.
[3696.22s -> 3698.02s]  I haven't played this game in 10 years, dude.
[3702.95s -> 3706.04s]  You weren't ready for the pub push.
[3706.04s -> 3707.16s]  Come on.
[3707.16s -> 3710.80s]  I just I was I'm just trying to figure out how to play the goddamn game again.
[3716.04s -> 3719.06s]  Oh, and are we leaving again?
[3719.06s -> 3721.31s]  Unless you want to play Venice again.
[3721.31s -> 3722.97s]  I didn't find that map particularly terrible.
[3722.97s -> 3725.15s]  It's just kind of big and too many places to go.
[3728.94s -> 3731.70s]  Well, next time you're like, well, hey, Venice isn't haunted.
[3731.70s -> 3734.39s]  Remember, you've never won a game on it yet.
[3734.39s -> 3737.38s]  We played it in one time.
[3737.38s -> 3739.22s]  What a coincidence.
[3739.22s -> 3740.58s]  Played it one time, lost one time.
[3740.58s -> 3743.18s]  What a coincidence.
[3743.20s -> 3747.83s]  I'm going to play with the bazookas beggar backwards.
[3749.38s -> 3753.47s]  The bazookas beggar.
[3753.47s -> 3758.84s]  I it's been 10 years.
[3758.84s -> 3764.82s]  Actually, it's been seven.
[3764.82s -> 3767.58s]  Are you still going to play viewfinder?
[3767.58s -> 3770.34s]  I don't know. Maybe I'm bad.
[3770.34s -> 3774.61s]  This is great. It's been a while since I've jumped in and played and cared.
[3778.44s -> 3781.00s]  Open some crates.
[3781.00s -> 3785.31s]  I could open a few crates, maybe.
[3785.31s -> 3790.16s]  Maybe we'll save the crate stuff for another day.
[3792.08s -> 3794.78s]  Huh? Because I want to play.
[3794.78s -> 3798.05s]  But you already got the keys.
[3798.17s -> 3800.73s]  Jerma, I don't want the quates opening.
[3800.97s -> 3803.62s]  They don't disappear.
[3803.62s -> 3807.15s]  Well, more team fortress.
[3807.15s -> 3810.39s]  Maybe. Yeah, there's another new map.
[3810.39s -> 3811.93s]  It's shark Bay. Don't go in the water.
[3811.93s -> 3813.19s]  There's sharks in the water.
[3813.19s -> 3817.55s]  Sharks in the water.
[3817.55s -> 3819.25s]  Always vote. Yes, always vote.
[3819.25s -> 3820.95s]  Yes, always. OK.
[3820.95s -> 3825.38s]  Don't even look. Don't even look.
[3825.38s -> 3830.18s]  OK. Oh, this is a off map.
[3837.12s -> 3843.83s]  Where is everybody?
[3844.83s -> 3846.49s]  Yes, again, I guess.
[3846.49s -> 3848.39s]  I mean, I don't know.
[3848.43s -> 3849.29s]  Wait, what?
[3849.29s -> 3851.29s]  Now I'm feeling like there's a little bit of a mix up.
[3851.57s -> 3853.03s]  Is it mix up?
[3853.03s -> 3855.72s]  There may be. I still put it.
[3855.72s -> 3859.49s]  Yes, anyway. He's gone. OK.
[3860.33s -> 3863.54s]  Where is the other team?
[3863.54s -> 3867.04s]  I don't know. Should we try again?
[3867.04s -> 3868.04s]  Yeah, you vote. Yes.
[3868.04s -> 3873.24s]  No, I mean, like, should we requeue?
[3873.24s -> 3874.90s]  I don't see anybody on Red Team.
[3874.90s -> 3878.24s]  There's like three people over there.
[3878.24s -> 3883.62s]  They're coming.
[3883.62s -> 3885.04s]  OK, I'm going to stay at this point.
[3885.04s -> 3886.54s]  Stop voting. Yes, I think.
[3886.54s -> 3888.02s]  I think we're being trolled.
[3888.02s -> 3893.21s]  OK. But maybe one more. OK.
[3897.51s -> 3898.65s]  Oh, where's the other team?
[3898.65s -> 3901.41s]  They're capping the point, Mr.
[3902.15s -> 3907.36s]  I got it. Have you ever seen a ghost?
[3910.67s -> 3920.80s]  Now you have. Nice one.
[3920.80s -> 3923.04s]  You've got to be fucking kidding me, dude.
[3923.04s -> 3925.24s]  I hit the guy twice and I get randomly dead in one hit.
[3927.11s -> 3931.74s]  You've still got some Venice on you.
[3931.74s -> 3943.51s]  Hasn't worn off yet.
[3943.51s -> 3952.58s]  It's very laggy, but I'm all right.
[3952.58s -> 3956.64s]  Are they on it? They're dead.
[3957.74s -> 3962.64s]  Now they're ghosts.
[3962.64s -> 3965.50s]  Come on. How much does it take?
[3967.36s -> 3970.66s]  I hit him like five times.
[3970.66s -> 3973.86s]  Oh, this isn't your grandfather's FPS game.
[3980.72s -> 3983.02s]  Oh, that's right. We get a little raunchy in here.
[3983.02s -> 3992.70s]  I got about the islander saying it is literally.
[3993.36s -> 3995.86s]  It actually is. Whoa.
[3999.24s -> 4000.30s]  Tracking my day.
[4000.30s -> 4003.80s]  I mean, you have to have skill in an FPS game.
[4010.28s -> 4014.95s]  Kill this motherfucker before he can build a set for it.
[4014.95s -> 4016.59s]  There's so many people in there.
[4016.59s -> 4018.49s]  All right. I got to I got to like stick with something
[4018.49s -> 4020.63s]  and stop switching every five seconds.
[4020.63s -> 4024.27s]  Equip the pen. Now we're going back to soldier.
[4029.87s -> 4033.41s]  I'm not allowed to get off of soldier for the next 15 straight minutes
[4033.41s -> 4035.79s]  no matter what. Oh, it's not happening.
[4055.77s -> 4058.25s]  You've got Liberty Launcher is incredible.
[4058.51s -> 4061.95s]  Whoever buffed this weapon out of their mind.
[4069.49s -> 4080.38s]  Oh, that fuck.
[4080.38s -> 4087.05s]  What am I voting? What am I voting?
[4087.05s -> 4089.73s]  That's a no for me. I know you.
[4089.75s -> 4096.02s]  OK. We're we can win it.
[4113.36s -> 4114.96s]  You know what I miss?
[4114.96s -> 4116.54s]  What's that?
[4120.24s -> 4122.34s]  The ghastly gibbous.
[4122.34s -> 4125.08s]  It's a great hat.
[4125.08s -> 4127.94s]  Yeah, you're not seeing too many of them these days.
[4132.60s -> 4139.38s]  See some ironic gibbouses.
[4139.38s -> 4140.70s]  This weapon is awful.
[4140.70s -> 4149.08s]  I'm going to play a different weapon.
[4149.08s -> 4150.72s]  I forgot it was inaccurate.
[4150.72s -> 4153.46s]  I forgot it like shoots it like there's a deviation of like
[4153.52s -> 4164.76s]  20 or 30 degrees every time you shoot.
[4164.78s -> 4167.98s]  There's what? Three minutes before I left me.
[4168.02s -> 4171.51s]  What is wrong with me?
[4171.51s -> 4174.39s]  Do I stink? Maybe.
[4174.39s -> 4176.15s]  Oh, no, because they're all healing.
[4176.15s -> 4178.25s]  What the fuck? Never mind.
[4178.25s -> 4181.97s]  I get it now. He'll stir.
[4181.97s -> 4185.74s]  He's playing. You had three.
[4189.08s -> 4191.32s]  Did I actually have three medics?
[4191.78s -> 4195.12s]  Yeah. And seriously, I was running around with like 20 HP like, hey,
[4195.12s -> 4198.73s]  don't say no to that. That's me.
[4198.75s -> 4200.75s]  I think we leave and we leave.
[4200.75s -> 4205.19s]  I think I think this is a three medic type of type of situation.
[4205.25s -> 4213.00s]  All right. I'm up.
[4213.00s -> 4217.40s]  I think this is a vote kick random people until we get three medics on Jerma.
[4219.74s -> 4224.02s]  No, I don't think so.
[4224.02s -> 4227.20s]  All right. Don't believe in ghosts.
[4227.20s -> 4229.04s]  Don't believe in like any conspiracy theories.
[4229.04s -> 4232.30s]  Apparently you believe in Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster.
[4233.04s -> 4236.99s]  Yeah. The Jersey.
[4236.99s -> 4240.98s]  No. Wait, what do you mean?
[4240.98s -> 4242.78s]  It's the same game. It's the same.
[4243.20s -> 4245.56s]  Oh, shit. It's like this game just crashed.
[4252.36s -> 4256.13s]  OK, I think we joined and left too quickly.
[4256.13s -> 4258.59s]  It says you're currently offline.
[4258.59s -> 4262.03s]  OK, well, we may have I may have broken some stuff.
[4262.07s -> 4262.73s]  I think you broke it.
[4262.73s -> 4266.43s]  It's not letting me start searching, but it does say a member of your party is offline.
[4266.77s -> 4269.37s]  OK, well, maybe restart TF2.
[4272.06s -> 4273.90s]  All right. It's not Tuesday maintenance.
[4273.90s -> 4276.23s]  It's literally Sunday.
[4276.23s -> 4280.02s]  OK, I'm going to restart TF2 and we'll go from there.
[4282.65s -> 4284.15s]  Are you relaunching?
[4284.15s -> 4286.29s]  I'm relaunching.
[4287.54s -> 4289.74s]  Give it a second. It has to do that weird thing again.
[4293.78s -> 4296.98s]  You broke it.
[4296.98s -> 4299.94s]  You broke it.
[4299.94s -> 4302.30s]  The government broke it when I brought up Bigfoot.
[4303.69s -> 4306.09s]  I mean, Bigfoot makes sense to me because this I mean,
[4306.09s -> 4309.53s]  there's a very real possibility that there's just like a huge gorilla just somewhere
[4309.53s -> 4314.26s]  and it's just way bigger than everybody else.
[4314.26s -> 4317.08s]  They're called gorillas.
[4317.08s -> 4320.36s]  Yeah, but but like a Bigfoot could potentially just be a huge gorilla
[4320.36s -> 4321.90s]  that people just oh, my God, it's Bigfoot.
[4321.90s -> 4327.04s]  No, dude, that's just a giant gorilla.
[4327.04s -> 4329.54s]  OK, are we still in a party?
[4329.54s -> 4332.32s]  Yeah. OK, should we try it again?
[4332.32s -> 4341.42s]  Yeah, I'm doing it. OK, go for it.
[4341.42s -> 4345.48s]  There we go. OK.
[4345.48s -> 4349.36s]  In the U.S. in the wild, do you think a giant gorilla is walking around?
[4351.94s -> 4370.94s]  I mean, I don't know. Possible.
[4370.94s -> 4374.40s]  It's just a furry.
[4374.40s -> 4376.09s]  I would buy that.
[4376.09s -> 4378.09s]  Yeah, I would just use like for the OK.
[4378.09s -> 4380.05s]  You want a weird story?
[4380.05s -> 4384.19s]  I don't think I've ever talked about this with you that you saw Bigfoot one time.
[4384.97s -> 4387.37s]  Well, yeah, but also, OK.
[4389.98s -> 4391.12s]  When I was a little kid,
[4391.12s -> 4395.60s]  we're talking like a real little like it may have been preschool age. OK.
[4398.18s -> 4401.82s]  I got a Spider-Man costume on Halloween and I loved it.
[4402.32s -> 4404.12s]  So we got to leave. OK.
[4406.39s -> 4410.88s]  OK, the hardest part, you got to find matches.
[4410.88s -> 4415.58s]  OK, so when I was a little kid in preschool, I had a Spider-Man costume
[4415.58s -> 4416.88s]  for Halloween and I loved it.
[4416.88s -> 4418.92s]  And I just thought it was cool to like be Spider-Man.
[4418.92s -> 4421.36s]  So I'd just wear it on days that weren't Halloween.
[4421.36s -> 4424.92s]  And I'd like go out back and like play around in my Spider-Man outfit.
[4425.08s -> 4426.82s]  And I would never wear clothes under it
[4426.82s -> 4429.12s]  because I wanted to authentically be Spider-Man.
[4429.75s -> 4431.33s]  What my brother hated it.
[4431.33s -> 4433.47s]  My brother hated it because he's I have an older brother.
[4433.79s -> 4436.33s]  And me and my mom would go pick up my brother from school
[4436.33s -> 4439.97s]  and I would wear the Spider-Man outfit to greet him
[4439.97s -> 4442.27s]  when he's like coming out of school and like all his friends.
[4442.27s -> 4445.13s]  He like little Spider-Man running up to us like, that's so not cool.
[4445.27s -> 4449.55s]  And I think my mom would bring me along just because like she knew he hated it.
[4451.45s -> 4456.36s]  So you so you were like a you would you would like a practical joke.
[4456.99s -> 4459.19s]  Yeah. So my dad says, where is this going?
[4459.47s -> 4463.67s]  Bigfoot is totally just someone like testing out their first 100 percent.
[4463.67s -> 4464.49s]  I can relate to that.
[4468.19s -> 4470.19s]  All right. Are we are we going for it here?
[4470.19s -> 4472.73s]  Because like this is this is it.
[4472.73s -> 4473.83s]  This is the one I've got.
[4473.83s -> 4474.95s]  I've got my shit going here.
[4474.95s -> 4476.15s]  And now I'm going full on.
[4476.15s -> 4477.29s]  No, I'm going engineer.
[4477.29s -> 4478.79s]  This is my map on engineer.
[4478.79s -> 4480.57s]  Now I'll play good here. Check this out.
[4480.57s -> 4483.42s]  Top 15 minutes on soldier.
[4483.42s -> 4484.71s]  It doesn't count.
[4484.71s -> 4486.69s]  Yeah, it is a new map.
[4486.69s -> 4491.17s]  Hey, who cares about what wrench I'm using?
[4491.17s -> 4493.43s]  I just got to equip one.
[4493.43s -> 4505.79s]  Come on. How did you do that?
[4505.79s -> 4507.43s]  My mom says I can confirm.
[4507.43s -> 4510.77s]  So I guess that is why she brought me.
[4510.77s -> 4513.27s]  I don't know if she's saying I can confirm that's why she brought me
[4513.27s -> 4516.85s]  or I can confirm Bigfoot is just a guy testing a fursuit.
[4521.24s -> 4522.84s]  She may know more.
[4526.84s -> 4528.97s]  It's been a while.
[4528.97s -> 4537.08s]  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[4537.08s -> 4538.18s]  I got to go. I got to go. I got to go.
[4538.20s -> 4539.90s]  I got to go now. I got to go. I got to go. I got to go now.
[4539.90s -> 4541.64s]  I got to go. I got to go. I got to go. I'll be back.
[4541.64s -> 4542.58s]  Where's our sentry?
[4542.58s -> 4544.58s]  Fuck. Hold on. I just been a long time.
[4544.58s -> 4545.98s]  The gates opening.
[4545.98s -> 4548.18s]  It's been a long time. Hold on.
[4548.18s -> 4549.94s]  I didn't have the right equipment.
[4549.94s -> 4553.18s]  Just wait. It's been like it's been 10 years.
[4553.18s -> 4556.04s]  Where are you putting it? I'm going up here.
[4556.04s -> 4560.14s]  I hope it gets the build.
[4560.14s -> 4561.50s]  I'm keeping an eye on you.
[4561.50s -> 4569.32s]  Keep an eye on me, please. It's been 10 years.
[4569.32s -> 4572.20s]  All right. And that Pyro would not been able to be there.
[4572.20s -> 4574.20s]  Spy spy. Good. I just. Good. Good. I'm good. Good.
[4574.22s -> 4579.44s]  I wanted to die, so I come on, get the sentry.
[4579.44s -> 4581.94s]  Everything's fine. Protect my shit for a minute.
[4581.94s -> 4583.82s]  It's what shit?
[4583.82s -> 4586.30s]  There's a spy. There's a spy. There's a spy back there.
[4586.30s -> 4588.50s]  And he's eyeing my fucking cool building.
[4590.86s -> 4592.97s]  Your medic defended it.
[4592.97s -> 4595.94s]  Let's go.
[4595.94s -> 4597.54s]  All right. Now I'm good.
[4597.54s -> 4604.88s]  That's a spy right there. No doubt.
[4604.88s -> 4606.64s]  We're good. I got you.
[4606.64s -> 4610.66s]  It's me.
[4610.66s -> 4613.21s]  All right. Let's go check it out.
[4613.21s -> 4620.59s]  It's a cool weapon skin.
[4620.59s -> 4621.83s]  I don't know why I do that.
[4621.83s -> 4626.04s]  I'm just such a weirdo. I can't help it.
[4626.06s -> 4632.10s]  He's a freak.
[4632.10s -> 4640.05s]  Get that Pyro. Don't let him out of here.
[4643.44s -> 4647.56s]  I don't know why the fuck I do that.
[4647.56s -> 4649.06s]  Spies around here. Watch out.
[4649.06s -> 4650.30s]  Keep your eyes peeled.
[4650.30s -> 4652.16s]  Oh, nice pick up. Nice pick up.
[4652.16s -> 4657.06s]  See, you don't think I know what the fuck I'm doing.
[4657.06s -> 4658.12s]  Got the Wrangler?
[4658.12s -> 4660.58s]  No.
[4660.58s -> 4662.02s]  I bet you really know.
[4662.02s -> 4663.66s]  I mean, I don't like the Wrangler.
[4663.66s -> 4665.96s]  I don't like how it turns your sentry off for like three seconds.
[4665.96s -> 4669.30s]  You know, they they completely changed the short circuit as well.
[4669.30s -> 4670.36s]  Are they really?
[4670.36s -> 4673.16s]  Yeah. It's really weird now.
[4673.18s -> 4677.26s]  It shoots like a spear.
[4677.26s -> 4683.86s]  That's kind of cool.
[4683.86s -> 4687.48s]  I'll short circuit.
[4687.48s -> 4692.05s]  I'm doing fine. I'm good.
[4692.05s -> 4695.25s]  OK, so do you understand that you're doing fine because people are helping you?
[4695.25s -> 4697.33s]  Are you denying my help?
[4697.33s -> 4700.59s]  Engineer is the class that is incredible.
[4700.59s -> 4705.19s]  Soldiers above you.
[4705.19s -> 4711.93s]  Engineer is insanely important, but it requires teamwork for it.
[4711.93s -> 4713.89s]  He had the crits. He had crits.
[4713.89s -> 4717.65s]  All my stuff is still there besides Sentry. It's fine.
[4717.67s -> 4718.93s]  I just didn't whack my sentry.
[4718.93s -> 4722.27s]  Whack my helicopter once.
[4722.27s -> 4728.68s]  OK, oh, and there goes everything else.
[4728.68s -> 4732.58s]  I got your dispenser saved if that matters.
[4732.58s -> 4736.11s]  Um, it might.
[4736.11s -> 4741.97s]  It actually might be a huge deal.
[4741.97s -> 4748.77s]  My accolades.
[4748.77s -> 4752.61s]  I'm all right. I'm moving. I'm moving my shit.
[4752.61s -> 4756.20s]  Are we good? Are they on it or should I?
[4756.20s -> 4757.20s]  No, you're good.
[4757.20s -> 4765.30s]  I think we're still all right.
[4765.30s -> 4766.60s]  We're holding.
[4766.62s -> 4783.53s]  Yeah, we are. They're moving it.
[4783.53s -> 4786.51s]  They're moving it. Oh, shit.
[4786.51s -> 4794.96s]  But long, I freaked out and I grabbed my dispenser and died.
[4796.83s -> 4798.57s]  Hey, I'm doing fine, though.
[4798.57s -> 4800.78s]  You're doing great.
[4800.78s -> 4802.08s]  Turn off motion blur.
[4802.08s -> 4804.52s]  Is it on? Probably.
[4804.52s -> 4806.73s]  Does default on.
[4806.73s -> 4808.67s]  Well, that fucking was loud.
[4808.67s -> 4824.59s]  Uh, no.
[4824.59s -> 4830.77s]  Hey, nice. Easy.
[4830.77s -> 4834.81s]  The sentry being up at the time that it did in the zoning that it provided,
[4834.83s -> 4837.83s]  I believe I should get at least five friend points for that.
[4838.33s -> 4840.43s]  You should wait. You should have points.
[4840.43s -> 4844.27s]  You should also get five friend points because you protected my nest
[4844.47s -> 4845.97s]  when I was out there.
[4845.97s -> 4847.71s]  Where are we on friend points right now?
[4847.71s -> 4849.61s]  Am I above you?
[4850.31s -> 4853.08s]  Uh, you have 11. I have nine.
[4853.08s -> 4855.32s]  So I have. Yeah, we're pretty close in points.
[4856.49s -> 4859.79s]  Wait, those those points are friend points. Yeah.
[4861.40s -> 4864.60s]  All right. I'm going to go back to
[4864.88s -> 4867.02s]  I thought I had a strange gunslinger a long time ago.
[4867.02s -> 4870.08s]  Maybe not. So you said that.
[4870.08s -> 4872.82s]  Let me see the short circuit.
[4872.82s -> 4875.30s]  Fire has launched a projectile consuming energy ball.
[4875.92s -> 4878.26s]  Sixty five metal. That's a lot.
[4878.26s -> 4886.19s]  Yeah. Short circuit was kind of insanely good.
[4886.49s -> 4890.08s]  Was it? Yeah.
[4890.08s -> 4893.38s]  So you have to destroy projectiles with the ball and you can't just do it forever.
[4893.38s -> 4895.28s]  I'm not sure.
[4895.28s -> 4897.88s]  Did you begin weird ever since you got bitten by that bird?
[4899.94s -> 4903.98s]  What? When did I get hit by a bird?
[4907.42s -> 4909.76s]  You didn't get bit by a bird is what you're saying.
[4913.51s -> 4915.07s]  Are you denying it?
[4915.07s -> 4918.51s]  No, I just seriously going to go live right now in front of all these people and deny it.
[4920.85s -> 4924.49s]  Does that mean I'm being like chased by a bird and pecked in the head or something?
[4924.49s -> 4927.10s]  Like, how do you get bit by a bird?
[4927.10s -> 4930.97s]  I have a bird story.
[4930.97s -> 4932.97s]  My mom's here. I have I have the mom bird story.
[4932.97s -> 4934.83s]  Follow up. You get a lot of bird.
[4934.83s -> 4939.48s]  You get a lot of stories, don't you?
[4939.48s -> 4944.01s]  You could say that there's my birthday and there was a bird flying around.
[4944.01s -> 4944.77s]  It was being really weird.
[4944.77s -> 4945.41s]  It was going crazy.
[4945.41s -> 4947.15s]  It was coming for my birthday cake or something.
[4947.15s -> 4950.21s]  And my mom smashed it with a bag full of eaten corn husks
[4950.21s -> 4953.58s]  and smashed it down on the ground.
[4953.58s -> 4956.30s]  What? She defended me from the bird.
[4956.30s -> 4958.00s]  It was going it was insane.
[4958.00s -> 4959.80s]  Like, have you seen the movie The Birds?
[4959.80s -> 4961.00s]  It was like that bird.
[4961.00s -> 4962.50s]  So wait, so you didn't have friends.
[4962.50s -> 4965.10s]  You were being attacked by a bird.
[4965.10s -> 4969.88s]  Yeah. What the fuck?
[4971.81s -> 4978.02s]  Yeah, it was a bird dynamic, but real.
[4980.49s -> 4983.59s]  All right. Now that we're out, I can do this.
[4983.63s -> 4985.79s]  No, we're not. There's a there's a soldier back here.
[4988.02s -> 4989.90s]  What the fuck is happening with this?
[4989.90s -> 4995.14s]  People just back here behind the cart.
[4995.14s -> 5002.77s]  They must have a teleporter or something weird.
[5002.77s -> 5006.37s]  Unfortunate.
[5006.37s -> 5009.40s]  Is there they have to have a teleporter, right?
[5009.40s -> 5021.45s]  I didn't see one. I was jumping around all over the place.
[5021.45s -> 5029.92s]  Hey, somebody's killed that guy.
[5029.92s -> 5035.64s]  Oh, no. OK, he's all right.
[5035.64s -> 5037.08s]  I'm bringing this all the way up.
[5037.08s -> 5042.33s]  Make sure I don't get killed by anybody.
[5042.33s -> 5052.22s]  All right. So far, so good.
[5052.22s -> 5061.25s]  All right. Get on it.
[5061.25s -> 5063.65s]  Why? How come every time you die, you don't scream
[5063.65s -> 5067.06s]  as though you died in real life?
[5067.06s -> 5069.76s]  Because it's childish.
[5074.76s -> 5078.44s]  OK, see you in the next circus stream.
[5080.90s -> 5087.41s]  You've grown adult clown.
[5087.41s -> 5090.41s]  So what? Clowns just don't should not exist anymore.
[5090.41s -> 5091.99s]  They should never be a clown.
[5091.99s -> 5095.29s]  The only way clowns should exist if you're adult is if you're into the clown.
[5096.86s -> 5100.16s]  But so so you're saying that that we should not have clowns
[5100.16s -> 5102.36s]  should not exist anymore.
[5102.36s -> 5103.56s]  They should never be another clown.
[5103.56s -> 5105.46s]  That is not what I just said.
[5105.46s -> 5109.16s]  But an adult clown.
[5109.16s -> 5111.46s]  Who is it? Who is a clown that's not an adult?
[5111.46s -> 5114.35s]  What are you talking about?
[5114.35s -> 5116.15s]  Oh, fuck. I just blew up.
[5116.15s -> 5118.45s]  But who enjoys clowns?
[5118.45s -> 5121.83s]  Adults are clowns, but who enjoys clowns?
[5121.83s -> 5125.23s]  So what? So your opinion on entertainment is if we should just delete
[5125.23s -> 5127.83s]  everything, that's not your opinion of entertainment.
[5127.83s -> 5129.23s]  Is that what you're saying?
[5129.23s -> 5133.87s]  Tell me your opinion on D4.
[5133.87s -> 5136.91s]  It's not good. It's not good at all.
[5136.93s -> 5137.91s]  It's not good at all.
[5137.91s -> 5139.97s]  Oh, yeah, because you have the crowd now.
[5139.97s -> 5141.53s]  It like isn't even a thing anymore.
[5141.53s -> 5143.97s]  Like every day set on their own live stream.
[5144.17s -> 5145.37s]  That's just not fun.
[5145.37s -> 5147.51s]  Our bullet point is that's not true.
[5147.51s -> 5149.25s]  The game fun. I even bring it up.
[5149.25s -> 5151.55s]  They skip the bullet point because no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5151.55s -> 5153.81s]  Hold on. Rewind. Back it up.
[5153.81s -> 5155.65s]  Take 10 steps backwards.
[5155.65s -> 5157.65s]  Yeah. Who was three months ago?
[5157.65s -> 5160.39s]  At least a month ago, somebody said, hey, dude, how do you feel about D4?
[5160.39s -> 5163.39s]  And I went, you do not want to hear my D4 opinion.
[5163.59s -> 5166.16s]  Oh, no, you don't want to hear it.
[5166.18s -> 5167.62s]  And they were like, oh, shit, he hates it.
[5167.62s -> 5169.78s]  And I'm like, oh, I hate it.
[5169.78s -> 5172.16s]  So excuse me. I'm sorry.
[5174.61s -> 5177.31s]  Yeah, but now you're allowed to like actually say it.
[5177.91s -> 5180.11s]  I did. You've been given permission.
[5180.77s -> 5182.01s]  Who gave you permission?
[5182.01s -> 5183.81s]  Who in the story? But he gave me permission.
[5183.81s -> 5186.55s]  I just decided that, you know, OK, listen,
[5186.55s -> 5190.55s]  I think Diablo four is a good video game
[5191.29s -> 5195.19s]  that is that is not going to be done for like three years.
[5195.53s -> 5197.13s]  That's my real opinion.
[5197.15s -> 5200.90s]  OK, I think there is a good video game there,
[5201.36s -> 5203.90s]  but it's going to take like four years before it gets there.
[5206.75s -> 5211.83s]  Spy. It really was a spy.
[5213.36s -> 5215.26s]  Only four.
[5215.26s -> 5216.90s]  I don't know.
[5216.90s -> 5219.20s]  I'm going to play Path of Exile two anyways.
[5219.20s -> 5220.76s]  So what the who fucking cares?
[5220.76s -> 5224.18s]  Oh, he a real one.
[5224.78s -> 5225.88s]  I played D4.
[5225.88s -> 5227.26s]  It was like, it was all right.
[5227.26s -> 5229.76s]  Like the end game was kind of fucking terrible.
[5229.76s -> 5231.12s]  And I was like, whatever, I'm done.
[5231.12s -> 5233.32s]  I don't want to have the same unique drop eight times.
[5233.34s -> 5235.08s]  I'm done. That's it.
[5235.08s -> 5243.88s]  That's all I need to say. That's it.
[5243.88s -> 5245.86s]  Do you need more of an opinion?
[5245.86s -> 5247.26s]  I think that covers it.
[5247.26s -> 5249.42s]  I need your opinion on Ghost.
[5249.42s -> 5254.01s]  Hold on. Have an opinion on it.
[5254.01s -> 5259.14s]  All right. See if I can get.
[5259.14s -> 5264.29s]  Oh, I need a teleporter.
[5264.29s -> 5267.39s]  It's bad. I need someone to destroy the mini sentry
[5267.39s -> 5271.79s]  that is in the complete wide open next to the cart.
[5273.31s -> 5274.21s]  I'm an engineer.
[5274.21s -> 5276.35s]  No, the uber soldier.
[5276.37s -> 5279.81s]  Please. Hey, hey, look, bud.
[5280.71s -> 5285.88s]  I'm an engineer.
[5285.88s -> 5289.38s]  I saw practical problems.
[5297.94s -> 5305.23s]  That's you right now. Yeah.
[5305.23s -> 5307.51s]  That was a loud spy decloak sound.
[5307.51s -> 5322.42s]  I don't know where he is.
[5322.42s -> 5325.45s]  They're all coming up that way.
[5326.03s -> 5327.63s]  What the fuck did I just do?
[5327.63s -> 5328.93s]  What just happened? Oh, right.
[5328.93s -> 5330.11s]  That's what I wanted.
[5330.11s -> 5331.67s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[5331.67s -> 5334.37s]  I I pressed four and then five and then one and then two
[5334.39s -> 5337.97s]  and then three and four and then five and then two and then one and three.
[5338.81s -> 5341.01s]  I got to get my muscle memory back to playing engineer.
[5344.98s -> 5350.47s]  Still there, though.
[5350.47s -> 5352.77s]  Thanks for the teleporter, Chum.
[5352.77s -> 5354.18s]  You're welcome.
[5354.18s -> 5357.73s]  Really kind of need to move it up.
[5357.73s -> 5363.42s]  I did. I'm sorry.
[5363.42s -> 5366.02s]  I respect you as an engineer.
[5366.02s -> 5367.86s]  We are about to get this point, though.
[5367.86s -> 5371.93s]  We are. Now I'm going to go over here
[5373.96s -> 5378.57s]  and try to build up some shit over here.
[5378.57s -> 5385.37s]  I'm going to. OK.
[5385.37s -> 5388.69s]  Everything is good now.
[5388.71s -> 5390.25s]  In fact, I might might.
[5390.25s -> 5393.11s]  I don't want to move it that far because I don't want anyone to get killed.
[5394.01s -> 5395.91s]  Where is it in this role?
[5395.91s -> 5397.19s]  Pyro, I can help you.
[5397.19s -> 5398.89s]  I'm like the only pyre on the team.
[5398.89s -> 5401.84s]  Oh, you're good.
[5401.84s -> 5404.04s]  OK, but I thought it was about teamwork.
[5405.46s -> 5411.38s]  It is until it's me.
[5411.38s -> 5420.29s]  I think we're just going to win by right.
[5420.29s -> 5426.44s]  I don't know where he's going, but he went that way.
[5426.44s -> 5428.87s]  You know what? Fuck it. I'm going to make it quicker.
[5428.87s -> 5430.85s]  I'm going to this is stupid, but whatever.
[5430.85s -> 5435.66s]  It's like an extra five steps you don't take.
[5435.66s -> 5437.30s]  That will be the difference maker.
[5437.32s -> 5455.08s]  That actually might help.
[5455.08s -> 5458.19s]  Oh, come on. Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure.
[5458.19s -> 5460.79s]  Help, help, help.
[5464.33s -> 5466.63s]  Entrance teleport. Wait, what's going on?
[5467.84s -> 5470.50s]  Teleporter. Wait, what did I what did I do?
[5470.50s -> 5471.60s]  Did you do it backwards?
[5471.60s -> 5472.70s]  No, no, I didn't.
[5472.70s -> 5475.54s]  This is teleporter exit.
[5475.54s -> 5487.25s]  But yeah, you're good.
[5487.25s -> 5491.44s]  You're doing great.
[5491.44s -> 5492.68s]  And I am.
[5492.68s -> 5494.82s]  My buttons are so fucked up.
[5494.82s -> 5495.98s]  It's like most button.
[5496.00s -> 5498.30s]  Why is it mouse for to do that?
[5498.80s -> 5501.20s]  OK, that's very weird.
[5501.20s -> 5503.70s]  It's not three. It's mouse for.
[5505.86s -> 5508.24s]  I I wish I could explain why that just happened.
[5512.01s -> 5513.45s]  Are you blew up the exit?
[5513.45s -> 5515.45s]  I know. But my key binds.
[5515.45s -> 5517.99s]  I had to have had a reason like 10 years ago to do that.
[5521.71s -> 5522.67s]  What was the reason?
[5522.67s -> 5523.85s]  You're still the same person.
[5523.85s -> 5525.95s]  What did you do that for? Why did you do this?
[5525.95s -> 5533.04s]  I just killed a spy.
[5533.04s -> 5540.90s]  Ah, oh, no, he didn't even kill my shit.
[5546.58s -> 5549.88s]  Oh, no. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[5549.88s -> 5553.49s]  Just do you need a hand?
[5553.49s -> 5555.33s]  Everyone's just waiting for it to be done.
[5555.33s -> 5569.48s]  And it's not even fucking close.
[5569.48s -> 5572.89s]  But he's at the entrance.
[5572.89s -> 5579.33s]  You motherfucker. I'm coming back there.
[5579.33s -> 5581.03s]  I think we're losing.
[5581.03s -> 5582.93s]  We need the teleporter now. It's there.
[5582.93s -> 5583.93s]  It's there. It's there. It's there.
[5583.93s -> 5588.15s]  I promise. We need it now.
[5588.15s -> 5590.11s]  Well, you can't just demand things, OK?
[5598.25s -> 5599.89s]  Fuck you.
[5599.89s -> 5605.12s]  This guy just killed like three of us.
[5605.16s -> 5622.99s]  What are you now remembering?
[5622.99s -> 5626.11s]  The Huntsman's not OK.
[5626.11s -> 5628.75s]  Like being killed by it or using it.
[5628.75s -> 5630.45s]  It does a lot of damage.
[5630.45s -> 5631.49s]  It's really hard to use.
[5631.49s -> 5632.65s]  What's the last time you tried it?
[5632.65s -> 5635.25s]  When the enemy team has a lot of heavies,
[5635.25s -> 5637.59s]  I'm saying it's it's like brutal for them.
[5637.59s -> 5638.99s]  They can't really move.
[5638.99s -> 5642.29s]  And it's like 360 for like no charge time.
[5642.29s -> 5644.63s]  You just hop out at a heavy.
[5644.63s -> 5655.10s]  Yeah. And you get the sonar arrow.
[5655.14s -> 5656.58s]  Keep track. I'm making.
[5656.58s -> 5663.13s]  I'm being very aware of everybody.
[5663.13s -> 5664.53s]  This is risky. This is really risky.
[5664.53s -> 5667.43s]  But fuck it. I'm doing it.
[5667.43s -> 5668.83s]  Insanely risky.
[5668.83s -> 5670.37s]  We're moving up. We're on the cart.
[5670.37s -> 5671.17s]  We're winning right now.
[5671.17s -> 5675.08s]  If you're moving up, it's a good time.
[5675.08s -> 5678.42s]  Oh, that motherfucker back here.
[5678.42s -> 5679.58s]  That's why he's going to get me. He's going to get me.
[5679.58s -> 5680.52s]  He's going to get me. He's good.
[5680.52s -> 5682.24s]  He's good. He's really good.
[5682.24s -> 5685.84s]  Got him. Or I got one of them.
[5685.84s -> 5691.24s]  There's a few.
[5691.24s -> 5706.85s]  How did he not die?
[5706.85s -> 5708.75s]  What the fuck? I tried to back up,
[5708.75s -> 5710.11s]  but he still got me with it.
[5710.11s -> 5711.45s]  What just happened?
[5711.45s -> 5713.69s]  I knew he was going to do that shit.
[5713.69s -> 5716.69s]  So I backed up and he still got behind me.
[5716.69s -> 5719.51s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[5719.51s -> 5722.03s]  Spy. What the fuck?
[5722.03s -> 5723.35s]  I knew he was going to do that.
[5723.35s -> 5726.33s]  So I backed up and he still got it.
[5726.33s -> 5728.24s]  Spy.
[5728.24s -> 5730.82s]  You got trick stabbed.
[5730.82s -> 5741.78s]  Yeah. That's whatever.
[5741.78s -> 5747.91s]  Your Boston is coming out now.
[5747.91s -> 5751.18s]  Oh, we're good.
[5751.18s -> 5753.20s]  You're not going to fucking trick stab me anymore.
[5753.20s -> 5757.89s]  God damn it.
[5757.89s -> 5759.59s]  Can we get a teleporter?
[5759.59s -> 5761.93s]  Dude, this spy is just,
[5761.93s -> 5766.62s]  he's just killing me over and over again.
[5766.62s -> 5768.72s]  There's a dude that's just making my life a living hell.
[5768.72s -> 5772.77s]  Even if I try to look for him.
[5772.77s -> 5775.23s]  Okay. Can we get a teleporter is what I asked.
[5775.23s -> 5776.41s]  Yeah. It was there.
[5776.41s -> 5779.11s]  And then you, you're not spy.
[5779.11s -> 5784.40s]  You're not, you're not spy checking.
[5784.40s -> 5789.36s]  Good enough.
[5789.36s -> 5791.22s]  Dude, you're washed up.
[5791.22s -> 5796.06s]  I was washed up in TF2 probably like seven or eight years ago.
[5796.06s -> 5797.26s]  So that's all right.
[5797.26s -> 5806.16s]  I was washed up like years ago.
[5806.16s -> 5809.16s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[5809.16s -> 5811.80s]  Or at least we're still getting scared Saturdays.
[5811.80s -> 5821.96s]  Yeah.
[5821.96s -> 5830.95s]  Oh shit. The sniper up there.
[5830.95s -> 5831.99s]  You know what? Fuck it.
[5831.99s -> 5832.81s]  Fuck it. We're going in here.
[5832.81s -> 5837.04s]  Fuck it. We're going in here.
[5837.04s -> 5838.18s]  Are we?
[5838.18s -> 5839.02s]  Yeah. Fuck it.
[5839.02s -> 5841.59s]  Let's just bring a teleporter in here.
[5841.59s -> 5843.48s]  Yeah. There's a good room.
[5843.48s -> 5845.56s]  That sniper is going to try to kill us.
[5845.56s -> 5847.71s]  Yeah. He is.
[5847.71s -> 5849.44s]  He's gaming.
[5849.44s -> 5854.03s]  Can't do much about it.
[5854.03s -> 5860.64s]  Shit. Okay. Well, it's not there anymore.
[5860.64s -> 5862.10s]  You should do it in the room before that
[5862.10s -> 5864.06s]  is where you should be putting it.
[5864.06s -> 5865.36s]  Probably.
[5865.36s -> 5867.60s]  We still won.
[5867.60s -> 5870.46s]  Nice job.
[5870.46s -> 5871.86s]  Did we earn face cam yet?
[5871.86s -> 5873.92s]  Maybe in like another 10 minutes.
[5873.92s -> 5883.28s]  If you're good.
[5883.28s -> 5884.26s]  That was good.
[5884.26s -> 5886.12s]  You don't think we should stay?
[5886.12s -> 5887.10s]  No, you should not.
[5887.10s -> 5890.22s]  Okay.
[5890.22s -> 5896.62s]  As a professional kill streak haver, we should leave.
[5899.10s -> 5900.99s]  I'm going to go for the Huntsman.
[5900.99s -> 5902.73s]  I used to be so good with this.
[5902.73s -> 5903.91s]  And I mean that unironically.
[5903.91s -> 5906.32s]  This video is on my channel with me
[5906.34s -> 5910.67s]  just fucking destroying like 20 kills in one life and shit.
[5910.67s -> 5912.91s]  It's I don't even know how I go back
[5912.91s -> 5915.80s]  and watch those old TF2 Huntsman videos.
[5915.80s -> 5917.74s]  And I say, how did I even do that?
[5917.74s -> 5921.88s]  I could never do that now ever.
[5921.88s -> 5922.92s]  You can put your mind to it.
[5922.92s -> 5925.12s]  You can do anything.
[5925.12s -> 5929.79s]  There's one string in a, I think it's on nucleus.
[5929.79s -> 5932.63s]  I just hit like 10 headshots in a row
[5932.63s -> 5936.47s]  over the course of like maybe 30 to 40 seconds.
[5936.47s -> 5938.37s]  It's fucking crazy.
[5938.37s -> 5940.23s]  Was that German mad?
[5940.25s -> 5942.13s]  No, no, no, no.
[5942.13s -> 5944.69s]  This is like just a regular just commentary.
[5944.69s -> 5946.17s]  The same thing.
[5946.17s -> 5948.66s]  We're playing nucleus in that video.
[5948.66s -> 5951.94s]  I will never play an FPS game better than that.
[5951.94s -> 5953.00s]  I was so motivated.
[5953.00s -> 5960.78s]  I hit every shot I took.
[5960.78s -> 5962.58s]  Oh, I forgot about the shields, right?
[5962.58s -> 5963.68s]  This is what I had on.
[5970.44s -> 5971.28s]  Can't be burnt.
[5971.28s -> 5973.50s]  Oh, I'll do Girardi.
[5973.50s -> 5974.34s]  See if I still got it.
[5974.34s -> 5975.18s]  I definitely don't.
[5975.18s -> 5979.98s]  This weapon's really hard to use.
[5979.98s -> 5982.67s]  That's why they call it the Luxman.
[5982.67s -> 5987.81s]  Cause it's very difficult to use.
[5987.83s -> 5991.86s]  I shouldn't be using this.
[5991.86s -> 5997.95s]  I got a cool hat though.
[5997.95s -> 5999.53s]  Doesn't that matter?
[5999.53s -> 6000.93s]  It does matter a whole lot.
[6007.98s -> 6009.36s]  Just let me play.
[6018.67s -> 6032.32s]  Nice.
[6032.32s -> 6034.86s]  But that jump of all the jump.
[6039.58s -> 6043.46s]  I gotta go a little higher.
[6043.46s -> 6046.82s]  Oh goodness.
[6046.82s -> 6051.20s]  Oh, they're all Girardi.
[6065.51s -> 6072.27s]  Oh, I thought it was right in the head.
[6072.27s -> 6075.78s]  The level one in the corner.
[6075.78s -> 6080.72s]  Destroy the sentry now.
[6080.72s -> 6084.81s]  Ouch.
[6085.69s -> 6088.36s]  I'm doing all right.
[6088.36s -> 6089.20s]  You gotta go a little bit higher.
[6089.20s -> 6099.86s]  There's a little bit of drop on the Huntsman.
[6099.86s -> 6101.56s]  Show us all your hats.
[6101.56s -> 6103.70s]  I'll show my backpack in a little bit.
[6103.70s -> 6104.54s]  He doesn't care.
[6104.54s -> 6105.36s]  What the?
[6107.52s -> 6108.36s]  No, no, kill me.
[6126.10s -> 6126.94s]  I got some health here.
[6126.94s -> 6136.56s]  I can't do it.
[6136.56s -> 6137.56s]  Yeah, I did that.
[6137.56s -> 6139.00s]  I'm the reason we pushed the cart.
[6139.00s -> 6141.80s]  Cause their whole team was in spawn chasing me around.
[6152.95s -> 6166.86s]  That was me.
[6166.86s -> 6167.92s]  Is that Pyro though?
[6175.52s -> 6176.66s]  Guys flying around.
[6177.52s -> 6178.34s]  Holy shit.
[6178.34s -> 6179.86s]  That guy went across the whole map.
[6179.86s -> 6188.41s]  Cause I'm in zooming.
[6188.41s -> 6189.25s]  All right.
[6189.25s -> 6196.10s]  This guy got to be fucking kidding me.
[6196.10s -> 6198.80s]  I thought I could catch him on the way down.
[6198.80s -> 6199.64s]  All right.
[6199.64s -> 6200.60s]  Can somebody kill this market garden soldier?
[6200.60s -> 6210.82s]  They're just flying around the map and killing everybody.
[6210.82s -> 6212.34s]  Fuckin' stupidness.
[6212.34s -> 6214.08s]  I hate market gardener battles.
[6215.26s -> 6216.86s]  Are you doing it too?
[6216.86s -> 6217.70s]  Yeah.
[6229.25s -> 6230.07s]  All right.
[6230.07s -> 6230.91s]  This is where you shine as Huntsman
[6230.91s -> 6232.05s]  because people just poke their heads out
[6232.05s -> 6234.93s]  and you get headshots every five seconds.
[6234.93s -> 6239.16s]  I want to see five right now.
[6239.84s -> 6240.68s]  A little bit higher.
[6240.68s -> 6248.92s]  I'm aiming a little too low.
[6248.92s -> 6250.44s]  Oh my God, dude.
[6250.44s -> 6255.07s]  Fucking somebody kill him.
[6255.07s -> 6257.32s]  You just shoot him.
[6257.32s -> 6258.72s]  I did and it didn't kill him.
[6258.72s -> 6260.52s]  He was covered in Gerardi too.
[6260.52s -> 6263.20s]  The guy with no gun?
[6263.20s -> 6265.28s]  The guy market gardening.
[6265.28s -> 6266.40s]  With no gun?
[6266.40s -> 6267.52s]  I Gerardi'd him.
[6267.52s -> 6268.96s]  I shot him with an arrow.
[6268.96s -> 6272.92s]  He was still alive and killed me with the fucking shovel.
[6272.92s -> 6273.76s]  Okay.
[6273.76s -> 6274.60s]  All right.
[6274.60s -> 6275.44s]  Okay.
[6275.44s -> 6276.28s]  That's what happened.
[6276.28s -> 6278.24s]  Okay.
[6278.24s -> 6279.08s]  All right.
[6279.08s -> 6279.90s]  Okay.
[6279.90s -> 6280.74s]  Okay.
[6280.74s -> 6281.58s]  All right.
[6281.58s -> 6288.08s]  Okay.
[6288.08s -> 6288.92s]  Okay.
[6288.92s -> 6289.76s]  He's back.
[6289.76s -> 6290.58s]  He's back.
[6290.58s -> 6291.42s]  He's back.
[6291.42s -> 6292.26s]  He's back.
[6292.26s -> 6293.08s]  And he's just, he's back.
[6293.08s -> 6293.92s]  And that's what he's doing.
[6293.92s -> 6294.76s]  He's just trying to kill me.
[6294.76s -> 6295.58s]  He's just coming for me.
[6295.58s -> 6296.98s]  He's coming to kill me.
[6296.98s -> 6297.82s]  That's what he's doing.
[6297.82s -> 6304.51s]  That's what he's doing.
[6304.51s -> 6305.35s]  That's what he's doing.
[6305.35s -> 6306.19s]  They respected it.
[6306.19s -> 6312.74s]  I like, I appreciate that.
[6312.74s -> 6313.88s]  You sucks.
[6316.12s -> 6319.18s]  Spot.
[6319.18s -> 6328.43s]  I got him.
[6328.43s -> 6329.71s]  Oh my fucking God.
[6329.71s -> 6330.53s]  Okay.
[6330.53s -> 6331.37s]  I think he comes over here,
[6331.37s -> 6333.79s]  tries to kill me and then runs until I get a full health
[6333.79s -> 6336.35s]  and then comes back to kill me again.
[6341.88s -> 6342.72s]  Yeah.
[6342.72s -> 6343.56s]  Why wouldn't that?
[6343.56s -> 6347.26s]  That's what you do in team fortress too.
[6347.26s -> 6349.08s]  You go, you try and kill them on respawn.
[6349.08s -> 6361.53s]  You can get health if your health's low.
[6361.53s -> 6362.37s]  I wasn't in the head.
[6362.37s -> 6363.21s]  Shit.
[6363.21s -> 6364.05s]  It looks like it.
[6364.05s -> 6371.00s]  There we go.
[6371.00s -> 6381.78s]  Oh, he just saved your sniper friend's life.
[6381.78s -> 6387.98s]  He's beginning to believe just a little.
[6387.98s -> 6390.74s]  Ooh, a teleporter.
[6390.74s -> 6392.22s]  He won't look at me.
[6392.22s -> 6398.75s]  What was that?
[6398.75s -> 6403.92s]  Like fucking weasel laugh.
[6403.92s -> 6407.85s]  That's the sound you make before you switch class.
[6411.36s -> 6413.04s]  I hit him again, but it didn't kill him.
[6413.04s -> 6418.69s]  Trying to get him up.
[6418.69s -> 6425.82s]  Shit, he hit me.
[6425.82s -> 6426.82s]  I wish these were headshots,
[6426.82s -> 6431.44s]  but they're like neck shots.
[6431.44s -> 6432.52s]  I still have to go even higher.
[6432.52s -> 6433.80s]  Yeah.
[6433.80s -> 6435.99s]  I'm afraid to go higher.
[6435.99s -> 6437.11s]  You won't get hurt.
[6437.11s -> 6439.67s]  I used to sit on what TR walkway
[6439.67s -> 6440.99s]  for like three hours straight,
[6440.99s -> 6447.91s]  just shooting at people with a Huntsman.
[6447.91s -> 6450.54s]  TR walkway is the real one.
[6450.54s -> 6453.30s]  Oh yeah, it was.
[6453.30s -> 6454.14s]  All right.
[6454.14s -> 6471.20s]  Who's up there?
[6477.02s -> 6479.08s]  I think right now you like know when I die.
[6479.92s -> 6481.72s]  Why don't you make noises when you die?
[6481.72s -> 6482.70s]  I am making noises.
[6482.70s -> 6484.24s]  You don't hear them.
[6484.24s -> 6489.70s]  Like death noises.
[6489.70s -> 6490.54s]  No, no.
[6490.54s -> 6492.24s]  I'm seeing a lot of pogs.
[6492.24s -> 6496.02s]  No, you can't pog until I get the headshots down again.
[6496.02s -> 6500.11s]  But I mean, I'm making noise when I get hit.
[6500.11s -> 6501.39s]  No, you're not.
[6501.39s -> 6505.64s]  Yes, I am.
[6505.64s -> 6514.13s]  No, you're not.
[6514.13s -> 6521.38s]  I might need sensitivity down a little more.
[6521.38s -> 6523.02s]  There's no such thing as sensitivity.
[6523.02s -> 6525.58s]  Fail RP.
[6525.58s -> 6526.42s]  What?
[6526.42s -> 6528.36s]  They have a cheater.
[6528.36s -> 6530.44s]  He didn't even,
[6530.44s -> 6537.84s]  his gun didn't even turn and look at me.
[6537.84s -> 6542.83s]  Shit.
[6542.83s -> 6545.04s]  Oh, we're on it.
[6545.04s -> 6548.24s]  But you can't kick bots if you're on the enemy team.
[6548.24s -> 6550.20s]  Someone from the other team has to kick them.
[6550.20s -> 6551.28s]  It's kind of awkward.
[6560.38s -> 6565.70s]  Hey, where was he?
[6565.70s -> 6571.46s]  Oh, I kind of fucked it up.
[6571.46s -> 6575.00s]  You typed that in party chat, by the way.
[6575.00s -> 6578.16s]  I don't actually know what the all chat is.
[6578.16s -> 6580.88s]  I really do not know what my button is.
[6580.88s -> 6582.08s]  You were like privately.
[6582.08s -> 6594.85s]  Oh, that was a good one.
[6594.85s -> 6596.65s]  It's why apparently.
[6596.65s -> 6600.47s]  Yeah, I got it.
[6600.47s -> 6614.96s]  We have a lot of time though.
[6614.96s -> 6616.98s]  Whoa.
[6616.98s -> 6621.17s]  Holy shit.
[6621.17s -> 6623.25s]  Ah, I thought I could get two.
[6623.25s -> 6624.77s]  Oh my God, I should have just swung at them
[6624.77s -> 6629.48s]  with the fucking melee.
[6629.48s -> 6632.23s]  Get da-da-donked.
[6632.23s -> 6634.15s]  Dude, my energy levels are increasing.
[6635.55s -> 6636.79s]  What does that mean?
[6636.79s -> 6638.67s]  That means exactly what it means.
[6638.67s -> 6639.79s]  Got it.
[6639.79s -> 6641.79s]  One shot of germ of protein shake
[6641.79s -> 6644.07s]  and your energy levels will be increasing.
[6649.73s -> 6650.57s]  Cool.
[6650.57s -> 6651.41s]  What?
[6651.41s -> 6652.25s]  No way.
[6652.25s -> 6653.93s]  All right, now this is where,
[6653.93s -> 6655.01s]  this is gonna shine.
[6656.19s -> 6660.30s]  I got a cool hat.
[6660.30s -> 6664.15s]  Make sure you buy Germa's milk.
[6664.15s -> 6674.32s]  Oh, that's not for sale.
[6674.32s -> 6675.60s]  Let me just hold on.
[6675.60s -> 6679.87s]  They kind of still have a cheating bot on their team.
[6679.87s -> 6681.84s]  You wanna leave?
[6681.84s -> 6682.80s]  No, it's upward.
[6685.16s -> 6686.16s]  That's why you stay.
[6690.22s -> 6691.06s]  Oh, check this out.
[6691.06s -> 6692.26s]  Check this out.
[6692.26s -> 6695.35s]  Does this still work?
[6695.35s -> 6696.91s]  Like when everybody gets up to the front gate
[6696.95s -> 6699.99s]  and you can hit them with Jurati before the gate opens.
[6699.99s -> 6701.70s]  That's the thing, right?
[6701.70s -> 6702.70s]  What is?
[6702.70s -> 6705.34s]  Like I can coat them with Jurati like at one second
[6705.34s -> 6706.38s]  because they're all gonna sit at the door
[6706.38s -> 6708.22s]  and be impatient.
[6708.22s -> 6710.18s]  You can try.
[6710.18s -> 6711.54s]  Are you good enough?
[6711.54s -> 6714.15s]  I think so.
[6714.15s -> 6714.99s]  Ready?
[6714.99s -> 6716.87s]  Here comes everybody in one, two, three.
[6724.60s -> 6737.91s]  He just goes back in spawn.
[6737.91s -> 6739.75s]  Oh, I thought he was gonna walk back.
[6739.75s -> 6740.87s]  Where are you?
[6740.87s -> 6742.26s]  Spawn.
[6742.26s -> 6743.74s]  Spawn, you dead?
[6743.74s -> 6744.66s]  I just died.
[6745.42s -> 6748.20s]  How come you didn't make a death noise?
[6748.20s -> 6750.28s]  That was kind of a before death sound.
[6754.91s -> 6755.75s]  I went, oh.
[6755.75s -> 6756.59s]  When you die, you're gonna be like,
[6756.59s -> 6758.15s]  oh man, I made a mistake there.
[6758.15s -> 6759.43s]  What I actually should have done is,
[6759.43s -> 6763.80s]  like, no, you're dead, dude.
[6763.80s -> 6767.08s]  Play scout?
[6767.08s -> 6773.20s]  I could, maybe.
[6773.20s -> 6775.56s]  That hurt.
[6775.56s -> 6777.89s]  Where are you?
[6777.89s -> 6778.73s]  I need you.
[6778.73s -> 6779.57s]  I'm a medic.
[6779.57s -> 6788.64s]  It's a market gardener.
[6788.64s -> 6807.94s]  Ah, he missed.
[6807.94s -> 6816.68s]  This dang fool.
[6816.68s -> 6823.38s]  Oh, I was about to go on a fucking run right there.
[6823.38s -> 6824.22s]  Where are you?
[6825.18s -> 6826.34s]  I'm playing Huntsman Sniper.
[6826.34s -> 6827.18s]  What do you need me for?
[6827.18s -> 6828.58s]  I need you.
[6828.58s -> 6835.01s]  I'm dead.
[6835.01s -> 6837.73s]  I'm alive now, and I just said medic.
[6837.73s -> 6839.33s]  I have like a cool hat on.
[6839.33s -> 6840.17s]  I have like a.
[6840.17s -> 6842.39s]  There's a soldier behind you.
[6842.39s -> 6843.23s]  What?
[6843.23s -> 6844.50s]  Where?
[6846.02s -> 6847.42s]  Is he dead?
[6847.42s -> 6848.90s]  He's dead, man.
[6848.90s -> 6850.14s]  You on 50 FOV?
[6851.82s -> 6853.80s]  No.
[6853.80s -> 6856.59s]  It'd be funny if I was.
[6856.59s -> 6858.31s]  Why are you doing that?
[6858.31s -> 6860.39s]  Don't pull a card, just blink.
[6860.39s -> 6861.63s]  Why would you do that?
[6862.51s -> 6863.35s]  Why not?
[6863.35s -> 6865.70s]  You're going to get screamed at in the chat now.
[6865.70s -> 6879.23s]  Oh, this is a serious match.
[6879.23s -> 6880.59s]  I thought there was going to be a lot more people
[6880.59s -> 6890.29s]  out there than it was.
[6890.29s -> 6897.85s]  Oh shit.
[6897.85s -> 6902.73s]  I'm going to play like gamer medic.
[6902.73s -> 6904.21s]  Play with a real weapon, please.
[6904.21s -> 6905.05s]  Okay.
[6910.16s -> 6911.40s]  One random sticky.
[6911.40s -> 6912.24s]  Heavy goes first.
[6912.24s -> 6914.90s]  Heavy goes first, that's priority.
[6914.90s -> 6915.74s]  You get priority.
[6915.74s -> 6916.86s]  You're heavy.
[6916.86s -> 6938.49s]  I'm a support class.
[6938.49s -> 6945.21s]  I got you, Frank the fish.
[6945.21s -> 6954.73s]  Everyone is hurt all the time.
[6954.73s -> 6955.93s]  Later, dude.
[6955.93s -> 6957.57s]  What do you mean later?
[6957.57s -> 6964.17s]  Our demo just turned off the map.
[6964.17s -> 6967.55s]  I got you, Frank the fish.
[6967.55s -> 6969.53s]  Thanks, bro.
[6969.53s -> 6970.37s]  Let's get them.
[6970.37s -> 6971.21s]  Let's get them.
[6971.21s -> 6972.05s]  Let's get them.
[6972.05s -> 6972.89s]  You ready?
[6972.89s -> 6976.21s]  Nope, I'm dead.
[6976.21s -> 6977.05s]  Coward.
[6977.05s -> 6980.23s]  Actually the heat maker, I don't want it here.
[6980.23s -> 6984.28s]  Give me the default.
[6984.28s -> 6988.88s]  Heat maker is good, but you got to get a lot of kills.
[6988.88s -> 6991.20s]  That's one of the more you headshots you get, right?
[6991.20s -> 6992.04s]  You get asked.
[6992.04s -> 6993.28s]  No, that's the other one.
[6993.28s -> 6999.55s]  The bizarre bargain is extremely powerful now.
[6999.55s -> 7003.69s]  Would recommend.
[7003.69s -> 7006.87s]  So it's mostly the same as like default,
[7006.87s -> 7009.95s]  unless you get headshots.
[7009.95s -> 7013.11s]  That was a headshot right there.
[7013.11s -> 7014.83s]  Oh, you see that 150?
[7014.83s -> 7025.75s]  Almost.
[7025.75s -> 7026.59s]  Say it.
[7027.75s -> 7029.07s]  I'm trying to...
[7029.07s -> 7030.11s]  Oh, that would have been good.
[7030.11s -> 7036.57s]  It was close.
[7036.57s -> 7037.45s]  I'm gaming, man.
[7037.45s -> 7047.06s]  I'm trying.
[7047.06s -> 7047.90s]  What are you doing?
[7047.90s -> 7049.30s]  Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[7049.30s -> 7050.30s]  There's nobody to shoot at.
[7050.30s -> 7051.14s]  Come on, shoot.
[7051.14s -> 7052.46s]  There's nobody to shoot at.
[7059.78s -> 7062.99s]  You're up on the leaderboard there.
[7062.99s -> 7067.17s]  That's me, the medic.
[7067.97s -> 7069.13s]  Leave it, right?
[7069.13s -> 7070.57s]  We're voting upward, right?
[7071.53s -> 7072.93s]  Does that mean we stay?
[7072.93s -> 7074.33s]  Do you want to vote upward?
[7074.33s -> 7076.53s]  I'll click on upward if you want to.
[7076.53s -> 7078.88s]  Can't really click it for some reason.
[7078.88s -> 7081.55s]  Oh, are we staying?
[7081.55s -> 7082.75s]  Yeah.
[7082.75s -> 7083.91s]  All right, something seems broken though.
[7083.91s -> 7084.95s]  I can't vote anything.
[7084.95s -> 7088.49s]  Neither can I.
[7088.49s -> 7093.62s]  Go risk on.
[7093.62s -> 7095.59s]  This happens.
[7095.59s -> 7099.59s]  I sure hope it's gold rush.
[7099.59s -> 7100.67s]  I love gold rush.
[7100.67s -> 7105.85s]  I wouldn't care.
[7105.85s -> 7109.09s]  They nerfed the bonk atomic punch.
[7112.42s -> 7115.81s]  I can see why.
[7115.81s -> 7116.65s]  That's the one where you drink it
[7116.65s -> 7117.49s]  and you become invincible
[7117.49s -> 7119.60s]  and you just run behind enemy lines.
[7119.60s -> 7121.00s]  Yeah, I think you run slower
[7121.00s -> 7123.08s]  and depending on the amount of damage you take,
[7123.08s -> 7126.52s]  you, after it ends, you get slowed.
[7126.52s -> 7128.00s]  We're on upward.
[7128.00s -> 7128.84s]  You should be happy.
[7128.84s -> 7129.68s]  We're on upper.
[7129.68s -> 7134.71s]  I am happy.
[7134.71s -> 7142.93s]  What do I want to do?
[7142.93s -> 7144.77s]  Should I go flog Pyro?
[7144.77s -> 7150.99s]  Not on offense.
[7150.99s -> 7162.86s]  What the hell is going on?
[7162.86s -> 7164.80s]  I got this cool item.
[7164.80s -> 7169.10s]  The Nostromo, Napalm-er.
[7169.10s -> 7171.26s]  I remember people wanted this shit, didn't they?
[7171.26s -> 7176.12s]  Some of the other tie-in items, right?
[7176.12s -> 7177.04s]  Equip the pen.
[7191.81s -> 7194.71s]  Get pack is good.
[7194.71s -> 7195.55s]  I think.
[7195.55s -> 7196.39s]  Do you have it?
[7196.39s -> 7198.60s]  Yes, I do.
[7198.60s -> 7200.64s]  You guys like my outfit?
[7200.64s -> 7202.68s]  I have the barbecue on my back.
[7202.68s -> 7205.20s]  I've got the funny glasses crooked
[7205.20s -> 7209.36s]  and I got the, I have the white mask thing.
[7209.36s -> 7210.76s]  I think I look pretty good.
[7210.76s -> 7211.76s]  You look great.
[7211.76s -> 7213.08s]  I cannot find you.
[7214.50s -> 7215.50s]  The right hallway.
[7219.63s -> 7220.47s]  What do you mean no?
[7220.47s -> 7222.03s]  You don't like the strip?
[7222.03s -> 7223.27s]  I'm judging, I'm judging it.
[7223.27s -> 7227.34s]  I wasn't a no, it was a consideration.
[7227.34s -> 7228.84s]  Yes, you look good.
[7228.84s -> 7233.43s]  Does it change it if I do this?
[7233.43s -> 7236.59s]  This is allowed.
[7236.59s -> 7237.43s]  Oh, hey.
[7239.85s -> 7243.30s]  What?
[7243.30s -> 7248.04s]  How do I look?
[7248.04s -> 7249.40s]  Ooh, you got a skateboard.
[7249.40s -> 7250.48s]  That's kind of cool.
[7250.48s -> 7252.36s]  Ooh, what is that?
[7252.36s -> 7255.72s]  You have like a fishy mode.
[7255.72s -> 7257.16s]  I tried to shoot it back.
[7257.16s -> 7258.44s]  If I shot that crit rocket back,
[7258.44s -> 7268.61s]  that would have been fucking awesome.
[7268.61s -> 7270.41s]  All right, sometimes I'm into Pyro
[7270.41s -> 7272.41s]  and I do well and sometimes I just die
[7272.41s -> 7284.26s]  after walking out the front door over and over again.
[7284.26s -> 7286.94s]  Ouch.
[7286.94s -> 7291.44s]  I'm a death magnet.
[7291.44s -> 7292.88s]  What does this hit sound?
[7292.88s -> 7294.00s]  It's kind of like the little gurgles.
[7294.00s -> 7298.50s]  I don't know what it is.
[7298.50s -> 7300.22s]  Jeez, that guy killed me very fast.
[7300.22s -> 7301.94s]  What the hell?
[7301.94s -> 7302.78s]  Degreaser?
[7304.31s -> 7314.84s]  I died really quick.
[7314.84s -> 7321.02s]  Oh, I got shot by a sniper.
[7321.02s -> 7324.40s]  Excuse me.
[7324.40s -> 7344.44s]  Can't pull me.
[7344.44s -> 7345.40s]  Oh, it's so low.
[7345.40s -> 7346.24s]  Nice.
[7346.24s -> 7354.96s]  Good job, good job.
[7354.96s -> 7355.80s]  I'm in trouble now.
[7355.80s -> 7363.21s]  Oh, good heals.
[7363.21s -> 7364.05s]  Come here, come here.
[7364.05s -> 7366.48s]  I can put you out.
[7366.48s -> 7367.64s]  Oh, I didn't know that Dumbleman
[7367.64s -> 7368.96s]  can equip the parachute.
[7383.85s -> 7385.01s]  Oh, he got stuck in the wall.
[7385.01s -> 7395.24s]  I would have hit him.
[7395.24s -> 7403.91s]  I'm going around.
[7403.91s -> 7407.02s]  Ooh, they're so focused.
[7407.02s -> 7407.86s]  Yeah, we're gaming.
[7407.86s -> 7410.56s]  These are absolutely gaming right now.
[7410.56s -> 7411.88s]  Oh shit.
[7411.88s -> 7417.53s]  I fucked it up.
[7417.53s -> 7422.10s]  We please see some, I'll play scout on defense.
[7422.10s -> 7425.81s]  Can we please see some scout, please?
[7425.81s -> 7431.27s]  We've been waiting.
[7431.27s -> 7436.13s]  In 2023 TF2, what is your favorite class to play?
[7436.81s -> 7438.53s]  Yeah.
[7438.53s -> 7439.77s]  Scout.
[7439.77s -> 7441.61s]  Seriously?
[7441.61s -> 7444.69s]  Yeah.
[7444.69s -> 7446.77s]  Sometimes I like doing a little bit of jumping,
[7446.77s -> 7449.25s]  but the scout guy kills everybody
[7449.25s -> 7459.05s]  unless there's a sentry.
[7459.05s -> 7470.56s]  Jumped over it, but it's all right.
[7470.56s -> 7473.06s]  Shit.
[7473.06s -> 7475.67s]  Oh, he's going to go up there.
[7475.67s -> 7478.36s]  Damn it.
[7478.36s -> 7480.00s]  You have a cat puke hit sound.
[7480.00s -> 7496.10s]  It kind of is.
[7496.10s -> 7500.24s]  Watch that right side.
[7500.24s -> 7501.20s]  He's actually dead dead.
[7501.20s -> 7509.55s]  I don't think so.
[7509.55s -> 7510.59s]  Oh, fuck you.
[7510.59s -> 7511.71s]  It didn't hit anybody.
[7511.71s -> 7512.75s]  What the fuck?
[7512.75s -> 7513.59s]  How?
[7513.87s -> 7515.35s]  It threaded a needle, dude.
[7515.35s -> 7526.24s]  That was, oh, come on.
[7526.24s -> 7527.08s]  Shit.
[7527.08s -> 7534.82s]  Save the crits.
[7534.82s -> 7537.77s]  Play with pyro vision on.
[7537.77s -> 7538.61s]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[7538.61s -> 7547.63s]  That sounds fun.
[7547.63s -> 7560.32s]  Oh, that's not going to work.
[7562.19s -> 7565.84s]  Oh, I hit him.
[7565.84s -> 7567.36s]  You're using the volcano fragment.
[7567.36s -> 7568.32s]  Oh, mega lol.
[7568.32s -> 7570.40s]  What's wrong with it?
[7570.40s -> 7573.08s]  Oh, the rift volcano weapon
[7573.08s -> 7576.08s]  from rift, the great game rift.
[7576.08s -> 7578.31s]  You can, yeah, this is fine.
[7578.31s -> 7580.52s]  It's a cool weapon.
[7580.52s -> 7583.42s]  That's the worst weapon in the game,
[7583.42s -> 7595.19s]  but isn't the cool factor of having a fire axe cool?
[7596.03s -> 7598.19s]  The sentry in the middle of the open.
[7598.19s -> 7599.03s]  Maybe.
[7612.72s -> 7613.56s]  Oh, I forget.
[7613.56s -> 7615.80s]  This is like the stereo weapon.
[7615.80s -> 7632.09s]  I can hear this in the middle of my brain when I shoot it.
[7632.09s -> 7633.81s]  Sniper, I got him standing still for you.
[7633.81s -> 7635.97s]  I am the distractor.
[7635.97s -> 7640.52s]  I'm medic.
[7640.52s -> 7641.96s]  I switched to medic.
[7641.96s -> 7643.96s]  It's me and backfield huntsman guy.
[7648.02s -> 7653.16s]  Everyone's over healed.
[7653.16s -> 7658.08s]  All right, go get him.
[7658.08s -> 7659.48s]  Oh, that's bad news.
[7659.48s -> 7665.94s]  Oh, I didn't know they were coming up that far.
[7665.94s -> 7667.06s]  Yeah, get it, get it, get it.
[7668.52s -> 7672.58s]  Okay, I get it.
[7672.58s -> 7673.42s]  I shouldn't have been up that far.
[7673.42s -> 7676.40s]  That was stupid.
[7676.40s -> 7677.56s]  That was bad news.
[7677.56s -> 7678.40s]  Bad chest.
[7678.40s -> 7679.28s]  That was kind of a tuber voice,
[7679.28s -> 7682.59s]  but we're playing TF2, that's the point.
[7682.59s -> 7683.51s]  We're back, baby.
[7683.51s -> 7694.81s]  We're back.
[7694.81s -> 7699.74s]  Feel like I'm fishing.
[7699.74s -> 7700.78s]  All right, come on.
[7700.78s -> 7702.74s]  Come on, Bloop-O.
[7702.74s -> 7705.78s]  Bloop-O is gonna win this for us right now.
[7705.78s -> 7716.30s]  Oh my damn it, dude.
[7716.30s -> 7729.64s]  I promise I'll get one Uber.
[7729.64s -> 7731.57s]  Oh, I see what you're doing.
[7731.57s -> 7737.70s]  Smart, smart.
[7737.70s -> 7738.74s]  All right, I have to hit.
[7738.86s -> 7739.70s]  All right, we're getting attacked.
[7739.70s -> 7747.34s]  We're getting attacked now.
[7747.34s -> 7750.34s]  All right, come on, Bloop-O.
[7750.34s -> 7753.77s]  Come on, Bloop-O.
[7753.77s -> 7760.07s]  Bloop-O's about to get on this.
[7760.07s -> 7762.08s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[7762.08s -> 7762.92s]  We're good, we're good.
[7762.92s -> 7767.33s]  I got an Uber.
[7767.33s -> 7777.90s]  Let's publish time, let's go.
[7777.90s -> 7778.74s]  Nice.
[7780.10s -> 7782.98s]  Why does it take the announcer for this to happen?
[7784.42s -> 7789.80s]  It does.
[7789.80s -> 7791.60s]  Dude, Bloop-O, I'm telling you.
[7791.60s -> 7796.13s]  No, Bloop-O, you're good.
[7796.13s -> 7798.49s]  Is that the heater?
[7798.69s -> 7800.41s]  That weapon's pretty cool.
[7800.41s -> 7802.88s]  The anti-spy heavy gun.
[7802.88s -> 7806.48s]  That thing's cool.
[7806.48s -> 7808.08s]  Dude, just let's roll it.
[7808.08s -> 7814.47s]  Don't even, just don't even stop.
[7814.47s -> 7823.39s]  I'm sorry, Bloop-O, I gotta spread it around.
[7823.39s -> 7826.28s]  Use your anti-spy gun.
[7826.28s -> 7831.12s]  I had to use it.
[7831.12s -> 7839.89s]  That's all right.
[7839.89s -> 7841.17s]  Hey, that was a good push though.
[7841.17s -> 7847.59s]  We got ourselves another three and a half minutes.
[7847.59s -> 7849.19s]  All right, what song am I doing?
[7851.28s -> 7853.76s]  Poker Face by Lady Gaga, mum, mum, mum, mum.
[7853.76s -> 7855.08s]  Wow, actually nice.
[7855.08s -> 7858.33s]  Just drop.
[7858.33s -> 7859.17s]  I got it.
[7867.23s -> 7875.99s]  I thought I was gonna hit him with at least one of those.
[7875.99s -> 7878.19s]  That was just the equivalent of,
[7878.19s -> 7881.11s]  I'm like two or three miles away from that guy
[7881.11s -> 7884.11s]  and I'm throwing rocks at him and he has a sniper rifle
[7884.11s -> 7884.99s]  and I'm sitting there in the open
[7884.99s -> 7887.67s]  just throwing multiple small rocks
[7887.67s -> 7890.40s]  that are not gonna go that far.
[7890.40s -> 7891.40s]  And why are you doing that?
[7891.40s -> 7894.80s]  It once fell off.
[7894.80s -> 7896.32s]  Are you one ear or two ear?
[7896.32s -> 7898.88s]  It's a two ear, it's two ear right now.
[7898.88s -> 7902.36s]  And you're able to function, what changed?
[7902.36s -> 7903.92s]  I think that's, I'm talking a little louder
[7903.92s -> 7906.12s]  because I can't hear myself talk.
[7906.12s -> 7909.11s]  Maybe that's why I'm being louder today.
[7909.11s -> 7910.27s]  I'm proud of you.
[7910.27s -> 7911.47s]  Thanks.
[7911.47s -> 7918.44s]  You're my little baby boo boo.
[7918.44s -> 7924.63s]  I feel like I haven't seen you in a while.
[7924.63s -> 7928.07s]  I was in the back line like all game doing absolutely nothing.
[7930.02s -> 7940.22s]  It, I was having a good time.
[7940.22s -> 7948.84s]  No, no, no, no, don't let him do that.
[7948.84s -> 7951.17s]  Ooh, where is it?
[7951.17s -> 7952.33s]  It's unkillable.
[7953.81s -> 7957.40s]  50 HP stationary thing.
[7957.40s -> 7959.90s]  Beware.
[7959.94s -> 7962.06s]  All right, I have, what class are you playing?
[7962.06s -> 7963.46s]  I'm sniper, you were just healing me.
[7963.46s -> 7966.70s]  I know, but sometimes I'm not Ubering you.
[7966.70s -> 7967.58s]  Let's do it.
[7967.58s -> 7969.46s]  Okay, one, two, three, go.
[7977.68s -> 7979.16s]  Why did you tell me to do that?
[7979.16s -> 7982.61s]  We got the sentry, technically speaking.
[7982.61s -> 7984.73s]  Actually a net win, that's true.
[7984.73s -> 7986.37s]  Yeah, look, we're doing it.
[7986.37s -> 7991.67s]  Oh shit, that's actually true, nice.
[7991.67s -> 7994.98s]  Oh shit, it actually did work.
[7994.98s -> 7999.00s]  We just inspired everybody.
[7999.00s -> 8000.80s]  Holy shit, the whole clip just went into somebody.
[8000.80s -> 8016.46s]  I just freaked somebody out so bad.
[8016.50s -> 8017.86s]  Smash, smash.
[8017.86s -> 8020.58s]  I was ever saying minus four.
[8020.58s -> 8024.10s]  Whoa, you must've told a really bad joke.
[8024.10s -> 8026.50s]  I've never even seen a minus four before.
[8026.50s -> 8029.37s]  What happened?
[8029.37s -> 8030.57s]  No, did you guys hear the,
[8032.57s -> 8038.49s]  it just wasn't on screen, I looked away.
[8038.49s -> 8041.73s]  I am not dying over there.
[8041.73s -> 8044.17s]  Whoa, Chris Krieg.
[8044.17s -> 8046.45s]  Whoa, what is going on?
[8046.45s -> 8048.17s]  Okay, so when you were giving me shit for like,
[8048.17s -> 8049.81s]  how come you're not screaming every time you die?
[8049.81s -> 8051.45s]  But when I say, whoa, Chris Krieg,
[8051.45s -> 8053.49s]  that's for you to make a little joke.
[8053.49s -> 8056.45s]  That's not a death noise, it's very different.
[8058.09s -> 8059.81s]  We're being stupid down here.
[8059.81s -> 8062.37s]  Turn around, turn around, turn around.
[8062.37s -> 8068.23s]  You stopped healing me.
[8068.23s -> 8069.15s]  That would've been so cool,
[8069.15s -> 8079.65s]  everyone would've thought I was cool if I did that.
[8079.65s -> 8081.77s]  Somebody said, this feels like a bit.
[8081.77s -> 8084.05s]  I think it's because me and Ster have not played this game
[8084.05s -> 8087.18s]  for 10 fucking years on camera.
[8087.18s -> 8088.02s]  I think that's probably why you feel that way.
[8088.02s -> 8089.74s]  We're playing separate games as well.
[8089.74s -> 8091.46s]  I feel like we're doing entirely
[8091.46s -> 8092.70s]  and completely different things
[8092.70s -> 8097.31s]  like we're in two different games.
[8097.31s -> 8098.63s]  I think we're doing fine though.
[8098.63s -> 8100.99s]  I got put into the ceiling.
[8100.99s -> 8109.83s]  I mean.
[8109.83s -> 8112.23s]  Oh, come on.
[8112.23s -> 8117.39s]  Did that really just happen?
[8117.39s -> 8122.35s]  Somebody shoot something, for goodness gracious.
[8122.35s -> 8123.59s]  We need the Uber.
[8123.59s -> 8129.82s]  I just have to try to stay alive longer.
[8129.82s -> 8132.12s]  Medic, wanna build Uber?
[8132.12s -> 8133.20s]  I'm coming.
[8133.20s -> 8142.64s]  Medic, can only run so fast, bro.
[8142.64s -> 8145.84s]  Oh, here, I'm charging, I'm building Uber for you.
[8147.26s -> 8150.60s]  You want me to play a class that gets Ubered?
[8150.68s -> 8152.32s]  Or do you wanna roll the dice?
[8153.60s -> 8155.40s]  I got this is direct hit soldier up here.
[8155.40s -> 8159.04s]  I think I'm all right.
[8159.04s -> 8161.12s]  This demo up here too, I think we'll be okay.
[8161.12s -> 8164.84s]  Oh, I almost got it.
[8164.84s -> 8166.60s]  Do not as a sniper, I'm gonna get hit in the head
[8166.60s -> 8173.08s]  if I show my face.
[8173.08s -> 8174.52s]  Every time I see a heavy,
[8174.52s -> 8177.56s]  they are seconds away from being backstabbed.
[8177.56s -> 8180.14s]  I need to heal, I gotta heal.
[8180.14s -> 8182.54s]  All right, I'm ready to Uber this soldier
[8182.54s -> 8187.05s]  if they're still alive up here.
[8187.05s -> 8187.89s]  Fuck.
[8187.89s -> 8189.09s]  Oh my God, dude.
[8189.09s -> 8191.63s]  I thought he killed them.
[8191.63s -> 8192.99s]  See, he had like the pan kill
[8192.99s -> 8196.11s]  and I was like, oh, he killed the guy.
[8196.11s -> 8197.23s]  I didn't know there was like three people
[8197.23s -> 8200.29s]  in the fucking corner.
[8200.29s -> 8206.54s]  No, I'm bad.
[8206.54s -> 8208.46s]  I saw the crit pan kill and I was like,
[8208.46s -> 8212.16s]  oh, nice, you got him.
[8212.16s -> 8220.60s]  Fuck.
[8220.60s -> 8221.44s]  Somebody up here now.
[8221.44s -> 8226.62s]  All right, get me out of the way.
[8226.62s -> 8228.46s]  We're going to push an Uber in.
[8228.46s -> 8230.22s]  We will eventually.
[8230.22s -> 8235.11s]  They just crits our front line.
[8235.11s -> 8236.63s]  Our front line is down.
[8236.63s -> 8250.28s]  Oh my goodness.
[8250.28s -> 8251.92s]  Oh heavy, peek this corner.
[8251.92s -> 8256.90s]  Not you.
[8257.82s -> 8259.92s]  You got dominated.
[8259.92s -> 8262.44s]  Yeah, the guy was behind us.
[8262.44s -> 8264.84s]  He didn't, I didn't, I did.
[8264.84s -> 8266.40s]  There was nobody there and then I turned around again.
[8266.40s -> 8269.00s]  There's a rocket in my face.
[8269.00s -> 8271.22s]  Medic, we need you.
[8271.22s -> 8272.70s]  Well, you need to keep the medic alive
[8272.70s -> 8273.54s]  and no one's doing that.
[8273.54s -> 8274.54s]  You keep going on the flank.
[8274.54s -> 8275.98s]  You're like down in the basement.
[8275.98s -> 8277.86s]  No, you follow where the medic goes.
[8277.86s -> 8278.98s]  Medic is the quarterback of Team Fortress.
[8278.98s -> 8280.50s]  I haven't seen you.
[8280.50s -> 8282.46s]  Well, you're playing sniper.
[8282.46s -> 8285.08s]  Can you heal me?
[8285.08s -> 8287.20s]  I'm the only medic on the goddamn team right now.
[8287.20s -> 8288.04s]  All right.
[8288.04s -> 8288.88s]  You're right next to me.
[8289.64s -> 8291.64s]  Look at how many, who takes priority?
[8291.64s -> 8295.72s]  Heavy or sniper?
[8295.72s -> 8296.76s]  Who takes priority?
[8296.76s -> 8298.00s]  You weren't healing him.
[8298.00s -> 8298.84s]  I was.
[8304.21s -> 8305.49s]  Oh no, you go get a health back.
[8305.49s -> 8307.17s]  Blue bow is gonna carry again.
[8307.17s -> 8311.33s]  Oh God, he's dead.
[8311.33s -> 8312.15s]  I got an Uber right now.
[8312.15s -> 8312.99s]  I got an Uber right now.
[8312.99s -> 8313.83s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[8313.83s -> 8314.65s]  Jump through, jump through.
[8314.65s -> 8315.49s]  We're going, going, going.
[8315.49s -> 8316.77s]  Go, go, go.
[8316.77s -> 8319.85s]  Get in there, go.
[8319.85s -> 8326.31s]  Don't touch it.
[8326.31s -> 8330.36s]  What, what, what?
[8330.36s -> 8331.20s]  It's chaos.
[8331.20s -> 8332.02s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[8332.02s -> 8332.86s]  Chaos, chaos.
[8332.86s -> 8335.64s]  It's chaos time.
[8336.28s -> 8338.03s]  You guys gotta get this.
[8338.03s -> 8341.68s]  Failure, failure, failure.
[8341.68s -> 8342.84s]  Leave.
[8342.84s -> 8344.26s]  You gotta leave now.
[8344.26s -> 8345.68s]  You're embarrassing me.
[8345.68s -> 8347.00s]  Wait, is there another round?
[8347.00s -> 8352.84s]  I left, I left.
[8352.84s -> 8354.81s]  Minus four?
[8354.81s -> 8356.34s]  What?
[8356.34s -> 8358.23s]  I got minus four.
[8358.23s -> 8360.44s]  I don't know why, why are people saying that?
[8360.44s -> 8364.04s]  What does that mean?
[8364.04s -> 8369.61s]  I think it means, I don't know.
[8369.61s -> 8373.22s]  What did I eat four of today?
[8373.22s -> 8375.22s]  If you want to see just how far
[8375.22s -> 8377.68s]  my gamer skill has fallen.
[8377.68s -> 8381.93s]  I got 52 points of the spy in one life.
[8381.93s -> 8388.18s]  I got like 60, but that's not ever gonna happen ever again.
[8388.18s -> 8389.69s]  Oh, this is one of the new ones.
[8389.69s -> 8394.42s]  You can definitely just go onto your walkway again
[8394.42s -> 8397.54s]  to get that the same way you got it the first time.
[8397.54s -> 8398.38s]  No, no, no.
[8398.38s -> 8400.86s]  I was very careful to make sure I didn't do that.
[8400.86s -> 8403.39s]  Cause I always wanted that to be accurate.
[8403.39s -> 8405.39s]  Cause when it happened, it was like, holy shit.
[8405.39s -> 8409.77s]  And now you want to preserve it for life.
[8409.77s -> 8416.94s]  Oh, I'm going to do, I'm going to go heavy with
[8416.94s -> 8418.66s]  maybe just default minigun.
[8424.73s -> 8427.44s]  I like the chocolate bar.
[8427.44s -> 8428.80s]  And we'll do gloves.
[8430.08s -> 8432.18s]  I like the chocolate bar.
[8432.18s -> 8434.95s]  This thing is cool, but it's kind of distracting.
[8434.95s -> 8436.39s]  You got a banana?
[8436.39s -> 8438.67s]  I do, but chocolate's kind of fun
[8438.67s -> 8441.99s]  because it gives you more max health.
[8441.99s -> 8445.40s]  But banana got potassium.
[8445.40s -> 8446.36s]  Bananas are great.
[8450.34s -> 8452.40s]  I have no idea where I'm going.
[8452.40s -> 8453.90s]  I think I'm going the right way.
[8453.90s -> 8455.70s]  There's arrows.
[8455.70s -> 8462.93s]  Yeah, I bit my tongue a little bit.
[8462.93s -> 8464.66s]  All right, let's do it.
[8464.66s -> 8467.98s]  I bit my tongue.
[8467.98s -> 8470.10s]  Oh, they come out this way?
[8470.10s -> 8479.12s]  Cool.
[8479.12s -> 8482.57s]  Is there a spy?
[8482.57s -> 8487.01s]  Why do I feel like there's not very many people?
[8487.01s -> 8488.61s]  Because they're cowards and they all died
[8488.61s -> 8490.69s]  and they need to respawn and respawns take a while.
[8490.69s -> 8492.25s]  I even turned around.
[8492.25s -> 8494.17s]  I turned around looking for a spy
[8494.17s -> 8496.25s]  and that second I turned my back, I'm dead.
[8496.25s -> 8498.25s]  There's a spy coming.
[8498.25s -> 8501.63s]  Spy dead ringer, spy dead ringer.
[8501.63s -> 8505.52s]  Pirate spy, pirate spy.
[8505.52s -> 8507.20s]  Let's do the fucking slowed down
[8507.20s -> 8510.07s]  instrumental version of that.
[8510.07s -> 8515.25s]  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[8515.45s -> 8518.94s]  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[8518.94s -> 8523.04s]  You just did the brown noise to me.
[8523.04s -> 8525.64s]  That was so Basie.
[8525.64s -> 8526.48s]  It really wasn't.
[8528.64s -> 8530.84s]  I mean, my pants tell a different story.
[8533.54s -> 8534.58s]  All right.
[8534.58s -> 8535.98s]  Honest to goodness, honest to goodness.
[8535.98s -> 8537.46s]  What the fuck just happened there?
[8537.46s -> 8538.30s]  What happened?
[8538.30s -> 8555.19s]  I haven't got to run all the way back there.
[8555.19s -> 8556.73s]  A lot of spies.
[8556.73s -> 8561.70s]  There are, I get there, turn around to look for a spy,
[8561.70s -> 8567.54s]  freak out for a second, spin my mini gun and die.
[8567.54s -> 8571.38s]  Their team may have like four or five of them.
[8571.38s -> 8572.38s]  I fucking knew it.
[8572.38s -> 8573.38s]  I knew it.
[8573.38s -> 8574.38s]  He might not even be dead.
[8574.38s -> 8594.25s]  Yeah.
[8594.25s -> 8605.09s]  There's one behind.
[8605.09s -> 8606.09s]  Sure is.
[8606.09s -> 8607.09s]  It's in my head.
[8607.09s -> 8609.39s]  I got 400 fucking health.
[8609.39s -> 8614.34s]  Yeah.
[8614.34s -> 8616.10s]  Oh shit.
[8616.10s -> 8622.14s]  Can someone do the spy math?
[8622.14s -> 8623.14s]  How many Ubers do they have?
[8623.14s -> 8626.88s]  Shit.
[8626.88s -> 8629.96s]  It's, it's, it's, this has to come down to like 1.2.
[8629.96s -> 8638.97s]  It's way too high still.
[8638.97s -> 8641.30s]  Even lower.
[8641.30s -> 8642.30s]  This has got to be like 1.1?
[8642.30s -> 8643.30s]  1. like 1.5?
[8643.30s -> 8644.30s]  Do it!
[8645.22s -> 8647.48s]  Do it!
[8647.48s -> 8648.48s]  Get it right!
[8648.48s -> 8651.30s]  That's better, I think.
[8651.30s -> 8657.34s]  Turn off the mouse.
[8657.34s -> 8660.57s]  The mouse acceleration is on.
[8660.57s -> 8669.55s]  It's off.
[8669.55s -> 8676.38s]  I feel the love of God.
[8676.38s -> 8677.62s]  Okay.
[8677.62s -> 8678.86s]  He's here.
[8678.86s -> 8679.86s]  He ain't dead.
[8679.86s -> 8684.05s]  Wow.
[8684.05s -> 8685.05s]  Wow.
[8685.05s -> 8687.01s]  Did the heavy appear behind me?
[8687.01s -> 8692.68s]  Ain't nobody killing me with a backstab now.
[8692.68s -> 8693.68s]  My whole team's there.
[8693.68s -> 8705.62s]  I don't want to be that pyro guy.
[8705.62s -> 8707.62s]  There's just too many species.
[8710.26s -> 8713.26s]  Can we get a director's cut of the speed video?
[8713.26s -> 8714.26s]  Like what you were thinking.
[8714.26s -> 8716.26s]  Like a whole walkthrough.
[8716.26s -> 8718.82s]  A whole walkthrough?
[8718.82s -> 8722.22s]  Yeah, you can like slow it down and point stuff out that like maybe like you don't notice
[8722.22s -> 8724.79s]  on your first watch.
[8724.79s -> 8725.79s]  That spy is not.
[8725.79s -> 8726.79s]  Oh my gosh.
[8726.79s -> 8744.10s]  I need ammo.
[8744.10s -> 8750.14s]  Dude, he's too good.
[8750.14s -> 8756.82s]  Ready to go.
[8756.82s -> 8757.82s]  He's not dead.
[8757.82s -> 8761.42s]  He's absolutely 100% still life.
[8761.42s -> 8762.42s]  Don't do it!
[8762.42s -> 8763.42s]  I thought I was part of a way.
[8763.42s -> 8774.20s]  Oh my.
[8774.20s -> 8775.20s]  Wait.
[8775.20s -> 8779.06s]  What?
[8779.06s -> 8780.06s]  Was it the pyro?
[8780.06s -> 8781.06s]  No, the pyro sprayed me.
[8781.06s -> 8782.06s]  The pyro sprayed me.
[8782.14s -> 8785.73s]  The pyro sprayed.
[8785.73s -> 8790.04s]  Jesus.
[8790.04s -> 8791.66s]  Gee whiz.
[8791.66s -> 8792.66s]  It was the scout.
[8792.66s -> 8797.66s]  Oh, he jumped up on the rock.
[8797.66s -> 8798.66s]  Oh, that bastard.
[8798.66s -> 8801.90s]  You played with the Dragon's Fury?
[8801.90s -> 8804.90s]  That's the new pyro one, right?
[8804.90s -> 8806.90s]  The pyro flamethrower.
[8806.90s -> 8810.90s]  I looked at it, but I never really actually tried to use it.
[8810.90s -> 8813.46s]  I've been enjoying it.
[8813.46s -> 8819.90s]  I'm a Dragon's Fury appreciator.
[8819.90s -> 8828.30s]  Come on.
[8828.30s -> 8832.68s]  Play scout.
[8832.76s -> 8833.76s]  Play scout.
[8833.76s -> 8843.45s]  Okay.
[8843.45s -> 8844.45s]  Fine.
[8844.45s -> 8845.45s]  It's a flare gun primary.
[8845.45s -> 8848.42s]  Yeah.
[8848.42s -> 8850.18s]  You don't actually hold a fire down.
[8850.18s -> 8871.69s]  It's like a weird like projectile in it and your face came on.
[8871.69s -> 8872.69s]  I'll turn my face.
[8872.69s -> 8881.18s]  Come on for exactly 10 minutes next round and I'll make sure to say now we're doing
[8881.18s -> 8882.18s]  it.
[8882.18s -> 8883.68s]  Now we're doing it.
[8883.68s -> 8884.68s]  Oh my God.
[8884.68s -> 8885.68s]  Jerma kind of looks like the scout.
[8885.68s -> 8913.41s]  Are you full of shit?
[8913.41s -> 8914.41s]  You real?
[8914.41s -> 8915.41s]  All right.
[8915.41s -> 8916.78s]  Wait, wait.
[8916.78s -> 8917.78s]  Hold on.
[8917.78s -> 8919.90s]  Do you kind of look like the scout because you played this game growing up?
[8919.90s -> 8920.90s]  What?
[8921.62s -> 8922.62s]  Do you just like mold it your life around it?
[8922.62s -> 8925.88s]  Is that kind of cringe?
[8925.88s -> 8926.88s]  What are you talking about?
[8926.88s -> 8929.98s]  Oh, look.
[8929.98s -> 8930.98s]  Oh, TF2.
[8930.98s -> 8931.98s]  I love TF2.
[8931.98s -> 8934.88s]  Like I'm going to like look like the scout now.
[8934.88s -> 8935.88s]  Oh my goodness.
[8935.88s -> 8938.44s]  I just I don't know where to go.
[8938.44s -> 8940.20s]  I think I have to go back here.
[8940.20s -> 8941.20s]  I don't know the route.
[8941.20s -> 8944.20s]  It is impossible to talk to you right now, by the way, dude.
[8944.20s -> 8949.20s]  We're playing separate games and everything I say is just like, wait, wait, wait, okay.
[8949.20s -> 8952.20s]  Like you're so involved in the game and you're so interested about what's going on.
[8952.84s -> 8954.84s]  I've kind of just given up.
[8954.84s -> 8955.84s]  All right.
[8955.84s -> 8956.84s]  What did you just ask?
[8956.84s -> 8957.84s]  Say it again.
[8957.84s -> 8958.84s]  It's no way.
[8958.84s -> 8959.84s]  It doesn't matter.
[8959.84s -> 8963.44s]  You asked me if I played with the pyro new primary and I was like, oh, it looks cool.
[8963.44s -> 8964.44s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8964.44s -> 8965.84s]  I am answering your questions.
[8965.84s -> 8967.92s]  I'm just like stuff is happening in the middle.
[8967.92s -> 8972.84s]  You're answering them if in that exact moment you have like three seconds of attention span
[8972.84s -> 8976.24s]  to give me your one word answer because I am 80, 80, 80, 80, 80.
[8976.24s -> 8977.24s]  Oh my God.
[8977.24s -> 8978.24s]  This guy's fucking watching the screen.
[8978.24s -> 8983.84s]  You didn't even finish that bit.
[8984.00s -> 8986.00s]  I've changed, dude.
[8986.00s -> 8988.00s]  I keep getting killed.
[8988.00s -> 8989.00s]  All right.
[8989.00s -> 8991.20s]  What?
[8991.20s -> 8992.20s]  Let's start over.
[8992.20s -> 8993.20s]  What did you say?
[8993.20s -> 8994.97s]  I have nothing left.
[8994.97s -> 8995.97s]  I said it all.
[8995.97s -> 8996.97s]  It's all been said.
[8996.97s -> 9002.94s]  It's all on record.
[9002.94s -> 9003.94s]  Sorry.
[9003.94s -> 9004.94s]  This game requires a lot of attention.
[9004.94s -> 9006.25s]  Does it?
[9006.25s -> 9007.25s]  Yeah.
[9007.25s -> 9009.00s]  When you're playing scout.
[9009.00s -> 9010.00s]  Yeah.
[9010.00s -> 9015.31s]  Did you hit the meat shot?
[9015.31s -> 9020.87s]  Uh, eight, eight D meat, meat shot.
[9020.87s -> 9021.87s]  80, 80.
[9021.87s -> 9022.87s]  Wait, no, no.
[9022.87s -> 9023.87s]  Eight smiley.
[9024.43s -> 9028.10s]  That was very loud.
[9028.10s -> 9030.86s]  Uh, turn your face cam on.
[9030.86s -> 9032.93s]  Okay.
[9032.93s -> 9033.93s]  Fine.
[9033.93s -> 9034.93s]  Hi, everybody.
[9034.93s -> 9035.93s]  Well, I'm like really zoomed in.
[9035.93s -> 9037.74s]  Oops.
[9037.74s -> 9038.74s]  I don't care.
[9038.74s -> 9042.67s]  All right.
[9042.67s -> 9043.67s]  You get, you get face cam for one round and it's gone forever.
[9043.67s -> 9049.06s]  You got long hair.
[9049.06s -> 9050.18s]  I told you I was just growing it out.
[9050.18s -> 9051.54s]  I'm going to just grow it as long as it can go.
[9051.54s -> 9052.54s]  I'm going to be as gross as possible.
[9052.54s -> 9059.54s]  All right.
[9059.54s -> 9062.54s]  You guys get face cam for one round, but mine's like bigger than his is.
[9062.54s -> 9064.42s]  It's fine.
[9064.42s -> 9068.99s]  Should I reset?
[9068.99s -> 9069.99s]  Hold on.
[9069.99s -> 9071.23s]  Let me resize it.
[9071.23s -> 9076.06s]  Wait, hold on.
[9076.06s -> 9077.06s]  Are you making yours bigger?
[9077.06s -> 9082.22s]  I just made it like 10% bigger.
[9082.70s -> 9086.62s]  It's free points.
[9086.62s -> 9087.62s]  That's free points.
[9087.62s -> 9101.09s]  I'll take it.
[9101.09s -> 9102.09s]  I actually really like this thing.
[9102.09s -> 9103.09s]  I never use it though.
[9103.09s -> 9106.82s]  Oops.
[9106.82s -> 9109.34s]  Camera's too high.
[9109.34s -> 9111.61s]  Camera's too high?
[9111.61s -> 9119.01s]  Uh, hey, I don't, I'm not, it's fine.
[9119.01s -> 9121.31s]  Yeah, I think mine's good.
[9121.31s -> 9125.96s]  Is yours like half the screen or something?
[9125.96s -> 9128.96s]  Well, no, you, I'm trying to copy what, yours is too high, mine's too high.
[9128.96s -> 9130.96s]  Like you think you're a special kid?
[9130.96s -> 9132.96s]  Thinking like, like cool joke, like nice fit.
[9132.96s -> 9135.96s]  Like, oh, it's so hard to like make your webcam too high.
[9135.96s -> 9136.96s]  Like funny.
[9136.96s -> 9151.23s]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[9151.71s -> 9155.38s]  Oops.
[9155.38s -> 9159.07s]  My face cam is going to stay the way it is.
[9159.07s -> 9160.63s]  Okay.
[9160.63s -> 9163.90s]  People say my chin's cut off.
[9163.90s -> 9164.90s]  It's fine.
[9164.90s -> 9168.50s]  It's because the camera.
[9168.50s -> 9169.50s]  You cut your chin off?
[9169.50s -> 9172.87s]  My, the camera's, I'll fix it in like a month.
[9172.87s -> 9180.53s]  There's a whole point of a face cam to show your face.
[9180.53s -> 9182.66s]  How long have you been streaming?
[9182.66s -> 9183.66s]  How many years?
[9183.66s -> 9187.80s]  I don't even, I don't even understand how this person keeps finding me.
[9187.80s -> 9191.32s]  There's like an eight second delay.
[9191.32s -> 9203.70s]  All right.
[9203.70s -> 9205.70s]  I'm going fucking psycho mode now.
[9205.70s -> 9207.51s]  Oh yeah.
[9207.51s -> 9208.51s]  You know, here it comes now.
[9208.51s -> 9209.51s]  Same.
[9209.99s -> 9211.99s]  You want to do double flog Pyro?
[9211.99s -> 9213.99s]  Ah, I'm Dragon's Fury.
[9213.99s -> 9216.99s]  I'm a Dragon's Fury enjoyer.
[9216.99s -> 9229.94s]  Oh my.
[9229.94s -> 9232.94s]  Oh, nice spy checking Pyro.
[9232.94s -> 9248.77s]  I flew the fire on every single person.
[9248.77s -> 9250.77s]  I wish they would make fall damage happen.
[9250.77s -> 9260.98s]  Just like, just like three feet higher or lower or you know what I'm saying.
[9260.98s -> 9262.98s]  That's a backstab right there.
[9262.98s -> 9275.06s]  There's my face.
[9275.54s -> 9277.73s]  Help.
[9277.73s -> 9279.16s]  Help.
[9279.16s -> 9280.16s]  Where'd the medic go?
[9280.16s -> 9283.06s]  Ouch.
[9283.06s -> 9284.06s]  Whoa.
[9284.06s -> 9285.06s]  Where?
[9285.06s -> 9287.78s]  From where?
[9287.78s -> 9298.81s]  He did it.
[9298.81s -> 9308.43s]  That was good.
[9308.43s -> 9309.86s]  We're good.
[9309.86s -> 9312.06s]  Hmm.
[9321.84s -> 9322.84s]  Sniper, they're coming.
[9322.84s -> 9328.97s]  How does he stay alive with 16 health?
[9328.97s -> 9330.97s]  Because he had 16 health.
[9330.97s -> 9345.68s]  Sometimes I forget that the fire projectiles like can kind of, you have to like move him
[9345.68s -> 9346.68s]  around.
[9346.68s -> 9349.68s]  Like they're like almost like delayed if you've tried to track somebody.
[9353.73s -> 9360.43s]  Are you serious?
[9360.43s -> 9364.80s]  Yeah, sometimes it's like it's hard to get it like directly on their body if they're
[9364.80s -> 9366.80s]  scraping around sometimes.
[9366.80s -> 9374.39s]  That's Mei from Overwatch.
[9374.39s -> 9375.39s]  Bye.
[9375.39s -> 9380.60s]  I heard it.
[9380.60s -> 9382.60s]  You are full of shit, Scout.
[9382.60s -> 9386.59s]  He's right.
[9386.59s -> 9387.59s]  They changed Pyro.
[9387.59s -> 9394.29s]  They changed all the flamethrowers work?
[9394.29s -> 9395.29s]  What?
[9395.29s -> 9400.30s]  Yeah, it's like you have to, the flame is its own like weird projectile that moves like
[9400.30s -> 9401.79s]  trails.
[9401.79s -> 9404.97s]  Oh, well I only use the Dragon's Fury.
[9405.45s -> 9407.45s]  Because I'm a gigantic.
[9407.45s -> 9414.30s]  I'm going to put the shotgun on.
[9414.30s -> 9418.20s]  Let's go shotgun time.
[9418.20s -> 9422.08s]  I should play with the degreaser, but I don't care.
[9422.08s -> 9423.08s]  Your audio got cut off, by the way.
[9423.08s -> 9425.08s]  We didn't hear the cool song.
[9425.08s -> 9438.99s]  Oh, we're doing a plenty hairstyle today.
[9438.99s -> 9440.99s]  Um, I don't think so.
[9440.99s -> 9456.33s]  I hit him with like almost every shot from a shotgun.
[9456.33s -> 9472.50s]  Just killed a hamster.
[9472.50s -> 9482.10s]  I don't believe that he's dead.
[9482.10s -> 9507.62s]  Oh, God.
[9508.10s -> 9512.10s]  The spy has almost a hundred points, by the way.
[9512.10s -> 9513.10s]  A hundred?
[9513.10s -> 9518.86s]  Yeah, because they feel bad for the spy and they give them all those points.
[9518.86s -> 9526.30s]  Don't you know that one spy backstab is like 30 points?
[9526.30s -> 9529.30s]  Ever since they nerfed the dead ringer, they're like, oh, I guess it's even harder now.
[9529.30s -> 9532.30s]  I think it's like 40 points for backstab.
[9532.30s -> 9538.87s]  The next person on the team has 38 points.
[9538.87s -> 9546.14s]  That's freaking ludicrous, dude.
[9546.14s -> 9547.14s]  I explained it.
[9547.14s -> 9548.45s]  I know.
[9548.45s -> 9549.45s]  Can someone push the cart?
[9549.45s -> 9550.45s]  I'm going to try to get on it.
[9550.93s -> 9553.93s]  I've noticed this is one of those maps where no one touches the cart at the end here because
[9553.93s -> 9563.06s]  they think someone's going to stop them and then they don't.
[9563.06s -> 9565.19s]  See?
[9565.19s -> 9566.19s]  Sniper is back.
[9566.19s -> 9567.19s]  That just happened.
[9567.19s -> 9568.19s]  That's two for two right there.
[9568.19s -> 9571.93s]  Ow.
[9571.93s -> 9576.65s]  Spy check mania?
[9576.65s -> 9577.65s]  Kind of what I'm doing right now.
[9577.65s -> 9612.10s]  It's the only thing I can do.
[9612.10s -> 9620.19s]  Alright, we're on it.
[9620.19s -> 9623.19s]  He still killed me.
[9623.19s -> 9626.19s]  This thing sucks, doesn't it?
[9626.19s -> 9628.19s]  Should I use this thing?
[9628.19s -> 9636.06s]  I'm just going to rig the fire axe.
[9636.54s -> 9643.74s]  I feel like the sound effect was even like lower.
[9643.74s -> 9670.66s]  It's like a...
[9670.66s -> 9674.78s]  Oh, fuck.
[9674.78s -> 9682.14s]  Fire axe is even worse.
[9682.14s -> 9684.14s]  I got to read all the items again.
[9684.14s -> 9687.14s]  Everything seems to be changed so differently.
[9687.14s -> 9688.14s]  That's cool though.
[9688.14s -> 9689.14s]  I'm happy about it.
[9689.14s -> 9696.29s]  It's like a whole other game to explore.
[9696.29s -> 9699.70s]  That's cool.
[9699.70s -> 9700.70s]  You got to read them first.
[9700.70s -> 9705.03s]  Why was that guy just a hundred miles per hour?
[9705.03s -> 9706.03s]  That was weird.
[9706.03s -> 9720.26s]  Dude, is he still alive?
[9720.26s -> 9721.26s]  What the fuck?
[9721.26s -> 9726.41s]  He is still alive.
[9726.89s -> 9733.80s]  That's a difference in bio.
[9733.80s -> 9738.28s]  I thought it was the same guy.
[9738.28s -> 9741.22s]  Why is that Pyro there?
[9741.22s -> 9742.22s]  It's not me.
[9742.22s -> 9744.22s]  It's me.
[9744.22s -> 9745.22s]  Literally me.
[9745.22s -> 9749.26s]  Did he not light on fire?
[9749.26s -> 9750.26s]  What was that?
[9750.26s -> 9757.77s]  I think he's dead.
[9757.77s -> 9776.48s]  No.
[9776.48s -> 9777.48s]  No.
[9777.48s -> 9778.48s]  He's still alive.
[9778.48s -> 9784.74s]  Dude, does the dead ringer make you not get hit by fire or something?
[9784.74s -> 9785.74s]  How come I couldn't do it?
[9785.74s -> 9788.74s]  It does extinguish you and then you have to light them on fire again.
[9788.74s -> 9790.92s]  If I'm not mistaken.
[9791.40s -> 9793.64s]  Because I felt like he died and then was invisible.
[9793.64s -> 9795.64s]  I lit him on fire and then it went off of him.
[9795.64s -> 9796.64s]  Spicycle?
[9796.64s -> 9799.64s]  You could also use the Spicycle, but that makes a noise.
[9799.64s -> 9800.64s]  Oh, right.
[9800.64s -> 9801.64s]  Okay.
[9801.64s -> 9808.49s]  It melts the Spicycle though, right?
[9808.49s -> 9809.49s]  At the same time?
[9809.49s -> 9810.49s]  Yep.
[9810.49s -> 9823.44s]  It does.
[9823.44s -> 9824.44s]  That was a good fucking shot.
[9824.44s -> 9825.44s]  Jesus.
[9825.44s -> 9827.44s]  It literally was falling down.
[9827.44s -> 9845.70s]  It's me.
[9845.70s -> 9847.58s]  I promise.
[9847.58s -> 9848.58s]  Okay.
[9848.58s -> 9849.58s]  The enemy team is like right up here.
[9849.58s -> 9851.58s]  There's a health kit, but they're going to look at you because this is their spawn.
[9851.58s -> 9855.81s]  Did you get the health kit?
[9855.81s -> 9858.69s]  I'm not there.
[9859.17s -> 9862.05s]  I think that's a spy you're looking at.
[9862.05s -> 9864.22s]  That's not your name.
[9864.22s -> 9865.22s]  It wasn't.
[9865.22s -> 9866.22s]  No, it was an engineer with me.
[9866.22s -> 9868.22s]  And then you look straight at my face and said, this is me.
[9868.22s -> 9869.22s]  I promise.
[9869.22s -> 9871.22s]  And I fucking believed you.
[9871.22s -> 9872.22s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9872.22s -> 9873.22s]  You're an engineer.
[9873.22s -> 9874.22s]  I'm a pyro.
[9874.22s -> 9875.22s]  Oh, wait.
[9875.22s -> 9880.50s]  What?
[9880.50s -> 9884.00s]  There was an engineer in the side room with a sentry and I walked up to him and I was
[9884.00s -> 9885.00s]  like, oh shit.
[9885.00s -> 9886.00s]  And he was shooting me.
[9886.00s -> 9887.00s]  He thought I was a spy.
[9887.00s -> 9888.00s]  So I was like, I'm real.
[9888.00s -> 9893.00s]  Were you in the middle of also a separate, but I was a pyro and like a damaged engineer
[9893.08s -> 9896.08s]  was walking around the corner and he stopped and stared at me as you said that.
[9896.08s -> 9899.08s]  And it was like, don't like, you're like, oh, don't worry.
[9899.08s -> 9900.08s]  It's me.
[9900.08s -> 9901.08s]  And I was like, oh, cool.
[9901.08s -> 9902.38s]  It's you.
[9902.38s -> 9904.38s]  Were they, were they good enough for his webcam time over?
[9904.38s -> 9905.38s]  They're being good.
[9905.38s -> 9909.32s]  I keep it on another round chat was bad.
[9909.32s -> 9910.32s]  Were they bad?
[9910.32s -> 9912.32s]  My chat was being very bad.
[9912.32s -> 9916.64s]  What the heck is going on here, guys?
[9916.64s -> 9918.64s]  All right.
[9918.64s -> 9920.59s]  Fine.
[9920.59s -> 9921.59s]  I'll do it too.
[9921.59s -> 9923.72s]  Is there enough time for me to pee?
[9923.72s -> 9925.28s]  Oh, yeah.
[9925.28s -> 9926.28s]  Let's all pee.
[9926.28s -> 9928.28s]  Let's actually leave the game.
[9928.36s -> 9929.36s]  Okay.
[9929.36s -> 9930.36s]  And let's do a little pee break.
[9930.36s -> 9934.04s]  Okay.
[9934.04s -> 10031.85s]  All right.
[10031.85s -> 10032.85s]  We're back.
[10032.85s -> 10033.85s]  I am back.
[10033.85s -> 10035.85s]  Are you also here?
[10035.85s -> 10037.92s]  How are you?
[10037.92s -> 10040.25s]  How's it going?
[10040.25s -> 10044.16s]  Oh, he's not here.
[10044.16s -> 10048.02s]  That was quick.
[10048.02s -> 10049.45s]  Yeah.
[10049.45s -> 10050.45s]  I mean, he's usually pretty quick.
[10050.45s -> 10055.25s]  So that's why I'm usually pretty slow.
[10055.25s -> 10056.25s]  So I took my time.
[10056.25s -> 10057.25s]  That's what I mean.
[10057.25s -> 10058.25s]  I was trying to.
[10058.25s -> 10059.25s]  You're usually pretty fast.
[10059.25s -> 10061.25s]  I was trying to match your time.
[10061.25s -> 10062.25s]  I'm like a fire hose.
[10062.25s -> 10064.64s]  He's seen it.
[10064.64s -> 10067.29s]  Are you ready?
[10067.29s -> 10069.11s]  Wait, what?
[10069.11s -> 10070.11s]  All right.
[10070.11s -> 10071.11s]  Let's go.
[10071.19s -> 10078.00s]  I'm going to keep my face game on because they were good.
[10078.00s -> 10079.00s]  They were good.
[10079.00s -> 10080.00s]  That spy was very good.
[10080.00s -> 10085.00s]  Wait, did you mean good at the game or good in chat?
[10085.00s -> 10086.00s]  Probably both.
[10086.00s -> 10093.44s]  Where's the game?
[10093.44s -> 10094.44s]  There it is.
[10094.44s -> 10097.48s]  We're joining.
[10097.48s -> 10102.11s]  Very cool.
[10102.11s -> 10103.11s]  Epic.
[10103.11s -> 10109.57s]  They were like three spies trying to kill you.
[10109.57s -> 10111.69s]  What's your most played time class?
[10111.69s -> 10112.69s]  So it is.
[10112.69s -> 10113.69s]  It's fine.
[10113.69s -> 10114.69s]  I think it's spy.
[10114.69s -> 10115.69s]  Honestly.
[10115.69s -> 10119.68s]  Either spy or engineer.
[10119.68s -> 10120.68s]  That was loud.
[10120.68s -> 10121.68s]  Is this the same one we were just in?
[10121.68s -> 10122.68s]  I don't think so.
[10123.60s -> 10124.84s]  No.
[10124.84s -> 10125.84s]  No.
[10125.84s -> 10133.86s]  I have a way better version of this.
[10133.86s -> 10138.00s]  Yeah, I got a factory new one of these things.
[10138.00s -> 10139.00s]  Let's put it on.
[10139.00s -> 10142.01s]  Oh, there we go.
[10142.01s -> 10143.01s]  That's way better.
[10143.01s -> 10144.01s]  Getting a little spicy.
[10144.01s -> 10145.01s]  It's a little.
[10145.01s -> 10164.36s]  I'm going to scout around town.
[10164.36s -> 10165.36s]  They're not.
[10165.36s -> 10166.36s]  Okay.
[10166.36s -> 10167.53s]  He came.
[10167.53s -> 10168.53s]  He became aware.
[10168.53s -> 10169.53s]  He did the you strap on heavy.
[10169.53s -> 10171.29s]  You just pretend you're not there.
[10171.29s -> 10172.29s]  You have a gibbous on.
[10172.29s -> 10173.53s]  You don't know what's going on.
[10173.85s -> 10174.85s]  And then you just awaken.
[10187.15s -> 10188.15s]  He's probably still alive.
[10189.67s -> 10190.67s]  Why are you doing that?
[10190.67s -> 10191.67s]  Why are you being weird?
[10191.67s -> 10192.67s]  Why are you being weird?
[10192.67s -> 10193.67s]  Me?
[10193.67s -> 10204.64s]  Spy.
[10204.64s -> 10205.64s]  You are.
[10205.64s -> 10206.64s]  There's no way.
[10206.64s -> 10208.52s]  I'm sorry.
[10208.52s -> 10213.79s]  You're alive still.
[10213.79s -> 10214.79s]  There's no way.
[10214.79s -> 10224.62s]  You know, I think you might be the most attractive streamer on this website.
[10224.62s -> 10225.62s]  Thank you.
[10225.62s -> 10228.01s]  I guess.
[10228.01s -> 10229.01s]  Anyone else agree?
[10229.01s -> 10232.66s]  It's not just me, right?
[10232.66s -> 10235.10s]  No, I don't know about that.
[10239.77s -> 10240.77s]  Well, like who else?
[10240.77s -> 10241.77s]  Who beats you?
[10241.77s -> 10243.78s]  I don't know.
[10243.78s -> 10248.60s]  Okay.
[10248.60s -> 10249.60s]  That's why.
[10249.60s -> 10272.35s]  Nobody beats you.
[10272.35s -> 10273.99s]  Ah, a nice movement heavy.
[10273.99s -> 10274.99s]  That was actually good.
[10274.99s -> 10277.83s]  Same guy.
[10277.83s -> 10278.83s]  I'll leave him alone.
[10278.83s -> 10279.83s]  He doesn't know what's going on.
[10279.83s -> 10280.83s]  I want him to enjoy the game.
[10280.83s -> 10285.44s]  I knew there was going to be a spy.
[10285.44s -> 10289.48s]  You should have your ego inflated.
[10289.48s -> 10290.48s]  I don't.
[10290.48s -> 10292.96s]  Look, I'm on a webcam.
[10292.96s -> 10293.96s]  That's like 480p.
[10293.96s -> 10296.96s]  Room is dark.
[10296.96s -> 10300.52s]  You look you look really good when I have to squint.
[10300.52s -> 10303.21s]  But I don't.
[10303.21s -> 10308.92s]  The blurriness just adds to the mystique.
[10308.92s -> 10310.52s]  Well, I appreciate that.
[10310.52s -> 10315.34s]  But I have what it that's a spy right there.
[10315.34s -> 10318.53s]  There's a spy right here.
[10318.53s -> 10319.53s]  You can't get a better webcam.
[10319.53s -> 10323.97s]  I don't want a better webcam.
[10323.97s -> 10324.97s]  Why not?
[10324.97s -> 10328.81s]  Because then people will just see like you like my face.
[10328.81s -> 10329.81s]  Your pores.
[10329.81s -> 10330.81s]  Yeah, I don't want to look.
[10330.81s -> 10331.81s]  Oh, man.
[10331.81s -> 10332.81s]  It's in like 4K.
[10332.81s -> 10333.81s]  No, don't look at me.
[10333.81s -> 10334.81s]  Fuck off.
[10334.81s -> 10336.37s]  I don't want you to look at my 4K face.
[10336.37s -> 10337.37s]  Like who wants that?
[10337.37s -> 10338.37s]  I don't want that.
[10338.37s -> 10339.37s]  There's a lot of people.
[10339.53s -> 10340.53s]  Looking at your face right now.
[10340.53s -> 10341.53s]  But it's like in 480p.
[10341.53s -> 10342.53s]  It's different.
[10342.53s -> 10345.05s]  That was weird.
[10345.05s -> 10351.86s]  Look at me.
[10351.86s -> 10359.31s]  Well, we're doing it.
[10359.31s -> 10376.80s]  You ever heard of like a something called the responsibility of a 10?
[10376.80s -> 10382.25s]  I have no idea what you're going with on this.
[10382.25s -> 10391.79s]  It is your responsibility as a 10 out of 10 man to just reproduce and to give as many
[10391.79s -> 10394.75s]  people an opportunity to be with you as possible.
[10399.67s -> 10400.67s]  What the fuck?
[10401.91s -> 10408.67s]  Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
[10408.67s -> 10410.27s]  That's so fucking insane.
[10410.27s -> 10413.63s]  I can't even play the game right now.
[10413.63s -> 10414.63s]  That was so fucked up.
[10414.63s -> 10415.63s]  I can't even fucking talk.
[10415.63s -> 10421.80s]  What do you mean?
[10421.80s -> 10425.71s]  I'm trying to snipe.
[10425.71s -> 10428.55s]  Do it.
[10428.55s -> 10431.35s]  I just heard that use.
[10431.35s -> 10443.71s]  That means it's a spy right here.
[10443.71s -> 10445.47s]  Oh, I see it now.
[10445.47s -> 10449.35s]  Oh, there's a secret sentry up there.
[10449.63s -> 10450.63s]  Oh, nose.
[10450.63s -> 10452.70s]  Oh, nose.
[10452.70s -> 10455.70s]  No, my nose was itchy.
[10455.70s -> 10459.75s]  Oh, he's not dead.
[10459.75s -> 10460.75s]  He's not dead.
[10460.75s -> 10461.75s]  He's not dead.
[10461.75s -> 10468.24s]  He's coming for me again.
[10468.24s -> 10469.92s]  Oh, finally.
[10469.92s -> 10473.23s]  Come on, make it happen.
[10473.23s -> 10476.87s]  Jeremy, you really need to make it happen.
[10476.87s -> 10484.06s]  He's going sicko mode with the Wrangler.
[10484.06s -> 10486.10s]  He actually kind of is.
[10486.10s -> 10490.37s]  He's killing everybody.
[10490.37s -> 10491.37s]  Say thank you.
[10491.37s -> 10492.37s]  You are ungrateful.
[10492.37s -> 10493.93s]  Fuck.
[10493.93s -> 10494.93s]  What?
[10494.93s -> 10495.93s]  Whoa.
[10495.93s -> 10496.93s]  What do you mean?
[10497.83s -> 10500.37s]  Like the 10 out of 10 thing you're saying.
[10500.37s -> 10501.37s]  I said thank you.
[10501.37s -> 10502.37s]  I don't know what to say.
[10502.37s -> 10507.48s]  I don't know what to say about that.
[10507.48s -> 10508.48s]  It's fine.
[10508.48s -> 10509.48s]  He doesn't have to say thank you.
[10509.48s -> 10514.13s]  Am I going there?
[10514.13s -> 10515.13s]  Don't tell anybody.
[10515.13s -> 10519.31s]  I went the wrong way.
[10519.31s -> 10520.49s]  Don't tell anybody I went the wrong way.
[10520.49s -> 10521.49s]  They'll think I'm an idiot.
[10521.49s -> 10524.65s]  You can't do that.
[10524.65s -> 10527.49s]  No.
[10527.49s -> 10529.05s]  Don't you dare trickstab.
[10529.05s -> 10534.86s]  You're going to jump off a fucking rock.
[10534.86s -> 10544.88s]  Somebody help me.
[10544.88s -> 10547.82s]  So bad.
[10547.82s -> 10550.78s]  It's a spy and he's a revolver and I have to get.
[10551.70s -> 10555.90s]  It takes me two and a half seconds to shoot him.
[10555.90s -> 10556.90s]  What was that supposed to mean?
[10556.90s -> 10557.90s]  Huh?
[10557.90s -> 10558.90s]  What was that supposed to mean?
[10558.90s -> 10560.14s]  What was that supposed to mean?
[10560.14s -> 10561.14s]  I'm really bad at spy.
[10561.14s -> 10563.09s]  Is what that meant.
[10563.09s -> 10567.54s]  Listen, Jerma, if you're not ready to accept compliments, I want your chat to know that
[10567.54s -> 10568.54s]  that's fine.
[10568.54s -> 10572.77s]  Not everyone is like I'm not good at receiving compliments, but you know, you got to hear
[10572.77s -> 10574.46s]  him more.
[10574.46s -> 10580.67s]  Does your chat let you know how fucking sexy you are?
[10580.67s -> 10583.83s]  Now?
[10583.83s -> 10584.83s]  What?
[10584.83s -> 10589.63s]  Now you're laughing about it?
[10589.63s -> 10592.92s]  Yeah.
[10593.60s -> 10594.60s]  We're just bros being bros.
[10594.60s -> 10595.60s]  Like, bros can't compliment each other.
[10595.60s -> 10596.60s]  Like, dude.
[10596.60s -> 10597.90s]  Yeah.
[10597.90s -> 10598.90s]  What's the problem?
[10598.90s -> 10599.90s]  What's the fuck?
[10599.90s -> 10603.38s]  What the fuck?
[10603.38s -> 10604.38s]  All right.
[10604.38s -> 10606.46s]  I'm going to lock and load.
[10606.46s -> 10607.46s]  Lock and load.
[10607.46s -> 10608.46s]  I.
[10610.46s -> 10619.38s]  Dick.
[10619.38s -> 10625.54s]  Let's go.
[10625.54s -> 10627.14s]  This has three shots now.
[10627.14s -> 10632.72s]  Wait, I feel like that was they're like little balls.
[10632.72s -> 10633.72s]  Hold on.
[10633.72s -> 10635.47s]  What does this weapon do now?
[10635.47s -> 10636.47s]  What weapon?
[10636.47s -> 10637.47s]  The lock and load.
[10637.47s -> 10641.98s]  It used to be cylinders.
[10641.98s -> 10642.98s]  Now it's like these little balls.
[10642.98s -> 10646.80s]  What's the speed damage versus buildings?
[10646.80s -> 10651.51s]  I think they just made it a little worse.
[10651.51s -> 10653.50s]  It sucks now.
[10653.50s -> 10654.50s]  It was always it was always three.
[10654.50s -> 10657.13s]  I thought it was two for some reason.
[10657.13s -> 10662.13s]  I believe it always was three, even though it has two slots.
[10662.13s -> 10664.52s]  That's probably what it is.
[10664.52s -> 10671.37s]  But I do remember it also having like a crazy damage bonus that doesn't seem to have.
[10671.37s -> 10672.37s]  It was two.
[10672.37s -> 10673.37s]  It was.
[10673.37s -> 10674.37s]  Oh, yeah.
[10674.37s -> 10675.37s]  Yeah.
[10675.37s -> 10676.37s]  I think it was two at release and then they buffed it.
[10676.37s -> 10677.37s]  And then it was like, why is it three?
[10677.37s -> 10678.37s]  There's only two shots.
[10678.37s -> 10679.37s]  But it sounds different, too.
[10679.37s -> 10680.37s]  I think I remember there being something with that.
[10680.93s -> 10683.45s]  Compliment.
[10683.45s -> 10684.45s]  Stir back.
[10684.45s -> 10685.45s]  I was stir.
[10685.45s -> 10688.01s]  You have very handsome beard.
[10688.01s -> 10689.01s]  Thank you.
[10689.01s -> 10690.01s]  It hides my face.
[10690.01s -> 10695.81s]  It's not what I meant.
[10695.81s -> 10699.54s]  I know.
[10699.54s -> 10702.46s]  But if I didn't have it, then you'd be able to see my mandibles.
[10702.46s -> 10707.02s]  And you've been very physically fit recently, really kind of taking your health very seriously.
[10707.02s -> 10708.02s]  That's good, too.
[10708.02s -> 10709.02s]  I have not.
[10709.02s -> 10713.82s]  See, I'm not going to take compliments either.
[10713.82s -> 10714.82s]  Apparently not.
[10714.82s -> 10715.82s]  See?
[10715.82s -> 10716.82s]  Hard.
[10716.82s -> 10726.70s]  Yeah.
[10726.70s -> 10727.70s]  All right.
[10727.70s -> 10731.88s]  They're probably going to go the other way now.
[10731.88s -> 10732.88s]  The other way.
[10732.88s -> 10733.88s]  They got to come this way.
[10734.84s -> 10743.89s]  Oh, OK.
[10743.89s -> 10744.89s]  They're coming up.
[10744.89s -> 10751.82s]  Wait, can I go in there?
[10751.82s -> 10752.82s]  Cats being bad.
[10752.82s -> 10753.82s]  You should turn face cam off.
[10753.82s -> 10756.26s]  Um, it's all right.
[10756.26s -> 10766.70s]  I want to be the swordsman.
[10766.70s -> 10767.70s]  I want it now.
[10767.70s -> 10775.94s]  I'm going to switch to medic in a little bit and I'm going to give you some crits.
[10775.94s -> 10776.94s]  I think.
[10776.94s -> 10778.50s]  What are you playing as?
[10778.50s -> 10779.50s]  Demo?
[10779.50s -> 10782.47s]  Yeah.
[10782.47s -> 10784.15s]  There's no way he's dead.
[10784.15s -> 10785.15s]  I'm playing the swordsman.
[10785.15s -> 10787.39s]  Wait, you wanted to give crits?
[10787.39s -> 10788.75s]  I knew he was dead, too.
[10788.75s -> 10790.93s]  Is that a difference?
[10790.93s -> 10791.93s]  Hello?
[10791.93s -> 10792.93s]  Yes.
[10792.93s -> 10794.81s]  I want to give you crits.
[10794.81s -> 10797.71s]  Oh, goodness.
[10797.71s -> 10798.71s]  I was very.
[10798.71s -> 10803.15s]  I was paying a lot of attention.
[10803.15s -> 10804.15s]  This one's me.
[10804.15s -> 10810.26s]  You heard the Liberty Launchers, the best gun in the game.
[10810.26s -> 10812.26s]  I have heard some theories about it.
[10812.26s -> 10815.80s]  Do you disagree with those theories?
[10815.80s -> 10820.20s]  I trust your theories because I feel like you know kind of what you're talking about.
[10820.20s -> 10821.20s]  That's a medic spy.
[10821.20s -> 10822.20s]  Yep.
[10822.20s -> 10831.31s]  Oh, fuck.
[10831.31s -> 10832.31s]  God damn it.
[10832.31s -> 10836.08s]  They came up with an Uber, too.
[10836.08s -> 10837.08s]  Yeah.
[10837.08s -> 10838.08s]  Ubers are kind of cheating.
[10845.81s -> 10846.81s]  Oh, shit.
[10846.81s -> 10853.70s]  How are we going to lose with Jormungandr on our team?
[10853.70s -> 10854.70s]  Holy shit.
[10854.70s -> 10855.70s]  The whole team was dead.
[10855.70s -> 10857.66s]  We all just came out at the same time.
[10857.66s -> 10864.84s]  Oh, my God.
[10864.84s -> 10865.84s]  You just run.
[10865.84s -> 10867.08s]  Okay.
[10867.08s -> 10868.08s]  I'm worried about.
[10868.08s -> 10869.08s]  I wanted to save the.
[10869.08s -> 10870.08s]  It was a.
[10870.08s -> 10871.08s]  It was.
[10871.08s -> 10872.08s]  Okay.
[10872.08s -> 10873.08s]  What the fuck?
[10873.08s -> 10874.08s]  That's a.
[10874.08s -> 10876.80s]  Do you want to give me the crits or do you want to run down and try and melee pyros?
[10876.80s -> 10877.80s]  The guy was running away.
[10877.80s -> 10888.12s]  I was trying to heal him.
[10888.12s -> 10890.33s]  I was depending on you.
[10890.33s -> 10891.97s]  I almost have it.
[10891.97s -> 10894.53s]  And your goldfish brain activated.
[10894.53s -> 10896.53s]  There are 10 people on the team.
[10896.53s -> 10901.61s]  All right.
[10901.61s -> 10902.61s]  I got it.
[10902.61s -> 10903.61s]  Where are you?
[10903.61s -> 10906.00s]  Press E. Fuck you.
[10906.00s -> 10907.00s]  Where are you?
[10907.00s -> 10908.00s]  Press E. I heard spy.
[10908.00s -> 10912.06s]  Keep going.
[10912.06s -> 10913.68s]  Keep going.
[10913.68s -> 10914.68s]  Nice.
[10914.68s -> 10927.31s]  Oh, all right.
[10927.31s -> 10928.55s]  We did.
[10928.55s -> 10929.55s]  We did.
[10929.55s -> 10930.55s]  Good.
[10930.55s -> 10931.55s]  We did.
[10931.55s -> 10932.55s]  Good.
[10932.55s -> 10933.55s]  We got it.
[10933.55s -> 10934.55s]  We got it.
[10934.55s -> 10938.10s]  We did.
[10938.10s -> 10939.10s]  We did.
[10939.10s -> 10940.10s]  Good.
[10940.10s -> 10941.10s]  I think I forced it.
[10941.10s -> 10942.53s]  There weren't a lot of people, but I guess we did kill people.
[10942.53s -> 10943.53s]  So we did kill people.
[10943.53s -> 10953.73s]  They got a teleporter behind us.
[10953.73s -> 10954.73s]  I got to go do this.
[10955.29s -> 10956.53s]  I will handle it.
[10956.53s -> 10957.53s]  OK.
[10957.53s -> 10959.54s]  I will be back here.
[10959.54s -> 10960.54s]  And you can come with.
[10960.54s -> 10962.54s]  Well, people need help over here.
[10962.54s -> 10967.94s]  Bad.
[10967.94s -> 10977.22s]  The guy who came up with the dead ringer.
[10977.22s -> 10979.10s]  Dead ringer is not that big of a problem.
[10979.10s -> 10982.86s]  I think it's the dead ringer, spy, sickle combo potentially that because you can get
[10982.86s -> 10983.86s]  out of a lot.
[10983.86s -> 10985.74s]  Jesus.
[10985.74s -> 10992.90s]  Back in my day, if you're if you died, you died.
[10992.90s -> 10998.18s]  If you're consistent and like, I mean, once I started really, oh, no, yeah, delete spy
[10998.18s -> 10999.18s]  from the game.
[10999.18s -> 11002.60s]  I agree.
[11002.60s -> 11009.47s]  See what?
[11009.47s -> 11014.62s]  No.
[11014.62s -> 11019.22s]  What if you start to pay attention to good despise?
[11019.22s -> 11020.22s]  I don't think he's dead.
[11020.22s -> 11023.25s]  It is.
[11023.25s -> 11028.78s]  So somebody has to be like constantly paying attention just constantly if there's a really
[11028.78s -> 11029.78s]  good spy on the team.
[11029.78s -> 11033.26s]  I can't.
[11033.26s -> 11035.95s]  But what if they make a mistake?
[11035.95s -> 11043.24s]  Shouldn't they die?
[11043.24s -> 11048.20s]  Didn't they nerf the dead ringer really, really bad at some point, like in 2015 or 2016?
[11048.20s -> 11049.20s]  Yeah.
[11049.20s -> 11052.26s]  But shouldn't they have done it four times?
[11052.30s -> 11055.74s]  I remember there was a pretty massive they made it loud, much louder, right?
[11059.02s -> 11060.66s]  I haven't maybe I'll play with it.
[11060.66s -> 11061.98s]  So yeah, that's a spy.
[11061.98s -> 11063.38s]  You're literally you're literally me.
[11063.38s -> 11064.38s]  There's three of you.
[11064.38s -> 11070.83s]  OK, now I think the problem is the spies that are on the other team are like they're just
[11070.83s -> 11072.43s]  there's like five of them.
[11074.55s -> 11102.18s]  One of them was me being extra paranoid.
[11104.59s -> 11105.67s]  Don't you think it's weird?
[11111.43s -> 11112.79s]  All right, we're getting a little too far up here.
[11120.56s -> 11122.44s]  This is kind of this is kind of scary.
[11122.44s -> 11123.20s]  This is scary.
[11123.20s -> 11124.08s]  We don't have Chris yet.
[11124.08s -> 11125.28s]  This is scary what we're doing.
[11126.22s -> 11127.54s]  Well, it looks like I'm behind you.
[11127.54s -> 11130.46s]  I'm behind you along with spy number 16.
[11132.99s -> 11135.99s]  I think he's still like, yeah, I don't know who's who.
[11137.26s -> 11138.62s]  Me neither. Let's walk forward.
[11138.62s -> 11139.18s]  Come with me.
[11139.18s -> 11140.18s]  Wait, wait, I need to heal his viral.
[11140.18s -> 11141.46s]  Come on. Yes, I do.
[11141.46s -> 11142.46s]  I'm a team player.
[11144.53s -> 11145.73s]  You're going to get back. He's not dead.
[11148.69s -> 11149.61s]  Do you do you want it?
[11149.61s -> 11150.85s]  There's people everywhere, dude.
[11151.69s -> 11152.69s]  Do you want it or not?
[11152.69s -> 11154.49s]  No, no. Am I screaming?
[11154.93s -> 11156.33s]  I would get scared the shit out of me.
[11157.75s -> 11159.27s]  Just don't get back. I thought it was going to die.
[11160.61s -> 11164.67s]  Did you? I have no ammo.
[11164.67s -> 11166.59s]  If I die because of this, I will be pissed.
[11171.62s -> 11177.19s]  Just just keep yourself busy.
[11177.19s -> 11178.63s]  I'm so busy, honey.
[11178.63s -> 11180.47s]  But here's an iPad.
[11180.47s -> 11185.62s]  Oh, I can make the crates.
[11188.18s -> 11191.10s]  I don't know if you could guess, but there is a there was a
[11193.02s -> 11207.24s]  high five behind us.
[11207.24s -> 11208.68s]  I'm trying to eat his sandwich.
[11208.68s -> 11209.72s]  TF2 on iPad.
[11209.72s -> 11211.20s]  That should be pretty.
[11211.20s -> 11215.90s]  That would be pretty lit.
[11215.90s -> 11219.05s]  Would it?
[11219.05s -> 11221.21s]  No. Will you get out of here?
[11221.21s -> 11223.09s]  Get out of here.
[11223.09s -> 11224.97s]  You give your little Billy.
[11224.97s -> 11227.13s]  Give little. Oh, God.
[11227.13s -> 11232.84s]  That guy should be dead.
[11232.84s -> 11234.76s]  All right. I must have some
[11234.76s -> 11237.12s]  bullets for you if you want some.
[11237.12s -> 11246.45s]  I'm coming. I'm dead.
[11246.45s -> 11247.37s]  Give it to someone else.
[11247.37s -> 11248.61s]  I'm about to.
[11248.61s -> 11253.52s]  Why is this thing not charging?
[11253.52s -> 11256.82s]  Come on, heavy. Go for it.
[11256.82s -> 11260.26s]  No, no, no.
[11260.78s -> 11263.88s]  Get it. How many are there, two?
[11263.88s -> 11265.52s]  How many people does it take to kill one spy?
[11265.52s -> 11267.60s]  That was like 11 people versus one guy.
[11270.05s -> 11272.49s]  We're good. How much damage reduction does the dead bringer give?
[11275.83s -> 11277.08s]  I don't know.
[11277.08s -> 11278.44s]  I think it's like 90 percent.
[11278.44s -> 11289.08s]  Let's leave. OK.
[11289.08s -> 11290.12s]  Op score.
[11290.12s -> 11291.48s]  Would I get a top score?
[11291.48s -> 11297.07s]  I don't think so.
[11297.07s -> 11303.89s]  That doesn't even say on the item.
[11303.89s -> 11307.09s]  I think this is coal allows you to see enemy health.
[11313.09s -> 11316.77s]  Sixty five percent damage reduction. Lame.
[11317.41s -> 11320.49s]  Collect the organs of people you hit with the Vita saw.
[11320.49s -> 11325.64s]  What was this before?
[11325.64s -> 11327.96s]  Oh, no, it looks like it's still the same.
[11331.37s -> 11335.78s]  Wait, that's actually kind of good.
[11335.78s -> 11337.30s]  What is organs?
[11337.30s -> 11338.22s]  I don't know.
[11338.22s -> 11340.82s]  So this is the one that keeps Uber if you're dead.
[11341.34s -> 11343.69s]  You get to keep a certain percent.
[11343.69s -> 11346.17s]  So percentage of your Uber charge level is retained on death
[11346.17s -> 11348.41s]  based on the number of organs harvested.
[11348.41s -> 11350.01s]  Fifteen percent per.
[11350.01s -> 11352.29s]  And you can get caps out at 60.
[11355.36s -> 11358.38s]  I think you have to hit people with it, though.
[11358.38s -> 11363.11s]  Minus 10 health.
[11363.11s -> 11364.39s]  If you're going to hit people, you might as well hit them.
[11364.39s -> 11365.75s]  Oh, my God. That's true.
[11365.75s -> 11368.27s]  You want to play Phoenix again?
[11368.27s -> 11369.87s]  Oh, I don't mind.
[11369.91s -> 11371.63s]  I'm I'm leaving.
[11371.63s -> 11373.19s]  I want to I want a different thing.
[11373.19s -> 11376.79s]  I'll take it off the list. OK.
[11376.79s -> 11386.50s]  I am out.
[11386.50s -> 11390.04s]  Let's start startling down to them.
[11390.04s -> 11391.48s]  Let's play some like classic ones.
[11391.48s -> 11396.38s]  Let's go to like, like nucleus or harvest, right?
[11397.62s -> 11405.14s]  Or bad water was that bad water an hour ago.
[11405.18s -> 11416.86s]  Yeah, it's been a while.
[11416.86s -> 11420.09s]  Sawmill. Yeah, so I'm a good one, too.
[11420.09s -> 11421.85s]  I don't think I want to play too for it.
[11421.85s -> 11422.77s]  Maybe not yet.
[11422.77s -> 11425.72s]  Undermountain. Undermountain is a good one.
[11425.72s -> 11426.68s]  Don't play Brazil.
[11426.68s -> 11430.29s]  I want to go to Thunder Mountain.
[11430.29s -> 11441.22s]  OK. Oh, ready to go to thunder.
[11441.22s -> 11445.06s]  Oh, here's the thunder because he lays down that lumber or something.
[11449.11s -> 11453.38s]  Oh, frontier. Cool.
[11453.38s -> 11456.74s]  Shout it from the mountaintops, baby.
[11456.74s -> 11461.43s]  Undermountain server is changing the way it actually is.
[11464.31s -> 11466.11s]  Yeah, a lot of time when you casual queue,
[11466.11s -> 11468.15s]  you'll get into a game at the end of the game because that's
[11468.15s -> 11469.79s]  what everyone leaves to find a good game.
[11469.79s -> 11471.96s]  But if you, you know, you see what I'm saying?
[11471.96s -> 11474.76s]  I kind of hope is going to Egypt.
[11474.76s -> 11477.00s]  Oh, God, I played Egypt the other day.
[11477.24s -> 11479.08s]  Once was enough.
[11480.54s -> 11485.18s]  All right, let's let me let me do something here.
[11493.10s -> 11498.36s]  Soldier has a lot of cool weapons.
[11498.36s -> 11499.48s]  Let's just go default.
[11499.48s -> 11503.16s]  Default rocket launcher like like it's a lot of cool weapons.
[11504.04s -> 11512.27s]  I you will use none of them with the pen.
[11516.28s -> 11519.92s]  This brings me back to like 2000, like 11, 2012.
[11522.26s -> 11526.22s]  My biggest nostalgia map turned out to be Snakewater.
[11526.86s -> 11531.78s]  Yeah. Snakewater.
[11531.78s -> 11534.34s]  What was the one that it was two payloads that had to cross each other?
[11534.34s -> 11536.71s]  You each had to push one.
[11536.71s -> 11538.75s]  There's Hightower.
[11538.75s -> 11541.99s]  And that one is the one that they cross paths.
[11543.34s -> 11546.62s]  I've been trying to remember the name of that one, too.
[11546.62s -> 11548.18s]  Not Hightower.
[11548.18s -> 11550.03s]  There was payload race.
[11550.03s -> 11551.59s]  Pipeline. Yep. Yep.
[11551.59s -> 11554.51s]  Pipeline. That place sucked ass, but it was so fun to play.
[11556.35s -> 11558.39s]  That's not what I expect you to say.
[11558.39s -> 11559.47s]  I mean, it did. Oh, yeah.
[11559.47s -> 11561.75s]  Oh, yeah. Pipeline that I fucking that.
[11561.91s -> 11563.50s]  Mm hmm.
[11563.50s -> 11566.22s]  Yeah, but it was a ton of it was a ton of fun to play.
[11566.22s -> 11568.22s]  But that place was just a mess.
[11568.22s -> 11570.66s]  But when the two carts were in the middle together,
[11571.66s -> 11573.06s]  it was just a mess.
[11582.92s -> 11585.04s]  The enemy team comes from up here where you're looking.
[11587.05s -> 11590.77s]  That's the enemy team spawn.
[11591.70s -> 11594.02s]  They're going to want to back up because they come out in 10 seconds.
[11594.46s -> 11595.58s]  I know what I'm doing.
[11595.58s -> 11597.82s]  And they are going to come out with an Uber. Good.
[11599.22s -> 11601.42s]  For those of you who haven't seen this game before,
[11601.42s -> 11604.30s]  an Uber makes them invulnerable and a medic gets it after a certain amount
[11604.30s -> 11610.22s]  of charge. It's an ultimate ability.
[11610.22s -> 11625.59s]  That isn't a spy.
[11625.59s -> 11634.66s]  Is this by get a dishwasher?
[11634.66s -> 11647.81s]  Oh, go, go, go. Quick, quick.
[11647.81s -> 11653.97s]  That guy is good.
[11653.97s -> 11657.01s]  Don't you? He's not dead.
[11662.23s -> 11664.31s]  Oh, shit. The engineer died.
[11664.31s -> 11666.67s]  Why? I'm going to stand in front of the fucking killed the engineer.
[11666.71s -> 11667.67s]  I'm going to say anyone.
[11667.67s -> 11672.72s]  I'm literally going to take any damage.
[11672.72s -> 11675.08s]  I'm going to use my I'm using my body to make sure there's nobody here.
[11675.08s -> 11677.22s]  It's this. Oh, man.
[11677.22s -> 11678.34s]  I don't care if I die. Tell me more.
[11678.34s -> 11679.90s]  Tell me. Tell me what you're doing with your body.
[11679.90s -> 11684.40s]  All right. He's back to this fucking spy.
[11690.35s -> 11691.59s]  Your health seems low.
[11691.59s -> 11695.31s]  If you want to know, maybe there's a dispenser.
[11695.83s -> 11697.35s]  We have no medics. Oh, shit.
[11697.35s -> 11705.78s]  I'm going to come heal you. OK.
[11705.78s -> 11707.50s]  Oh, you've got this pal.
[11707.50s -> 11709.98s]  There's a demo in the hallway.
[11709.98s -> 11711.90s]  Hit in the distance. I'm dead.
[11711.90s -> 11714.41s]  I'm dead, too.
[11714.41s -> 11728.55s]  Got to watch out for those.
[11728.55s -> 11730.71s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[11736.44s -> 11747.18s]  I don't even. Oh, he's up there.
[11747.18s -> 11750.06s]  Honest, honestly, who's your favorite character from World of Warcraft?
[11753.94s -> 11757.83s]  Um, that's a good question, dude.
[11758.43s -> 11759.91s]  That's that. Thanks.
[11759.91s -> 11762.94s]  Hold on. I got a minute because I'm dead.
[11762.94s -> 11765.34s]  Who's the best character from World of Warcraft?
[11765.34s -> 11766.62s]  Your favorite, not the best.
[11766.62s -> 11768.26s]  The best is obviously Sylvanas.
[11768.26s -> 11770.38s]  She's so powerful and so relevant all the time.
[11772.77s -> 11776.09s]  This is going to be a stupid answer, but I don't know if it is or not.
[11777.09s -> 11781.35s]  Uh, I got shot in the chest by this.
[11781.35s -> 11783.99s]  This is like a 14 kill streak.
[11784.19s -> 11786.67s]  Am I going to go pyro against hold the button down in a circle?
[11788.27s -> 11792.87s]  I mean, no one is even like I just watched like three people in a row
[11792.87s -> 11795.15s]  actually AFK standing still that he stabbed.
[11795.73s -> 11799.06s]  There's not much threat.
[11799.06s -> 11803.34s]  Uh, Kelthuzad, either Kelthuzad or Kael'thas.
[11804.15s -> 11804.99s]  There you go.
[11804.99s -> 11807.39s]  Why is Kelthuzad your favorite or Kael'thas?
[11807.39s -> 11808.31s]  Because they're like, I don't know,
[11808.47s -> 11810.90s]  they're kind of like they're goofy.
[11810.90s -> 11813.10s]  And Kelthuzad is like, I need more power.
[11813.42s -> 11815.38s]  Give me the mana, more mana.
[11815.38s -> 11816.46s]  Like, you know, he was cool.
[11816.46s -> 11818.58s]  I like to build sentries with.
[11818.58s -> 11822.40s]  Yeah, I got the crits.
[11822.40s -> 11823.84s]  Frank, let's go, Frank.
[11823.84s -> 11825.04s]  All right, I'll tell you when to do it.
[11825.04s -> 11828.64s]  Ready and activate.
[11830.91s -> 11833.23s]  Why did you not do it? I told you to do it.
[11833.23s -> 11834.83s]  What are you doing?
[11834.83s -> 11837.11s]  I just told you activate and you didn't do it.
[11837.11s -> 11838.31s]  I got hit the fucking head.
[11838.31s -> 11841.34s]  Activate means.
[11841.34s -> 11843.10s]  Why did you not do it?
[11843.18s -> 11850.23s]  Why didn't you scream?
[11850.23s -> 11853.32s]  I guess you're right, I didn't scream.
[11853.32s -> 11855.56s]  Oh, well, there goes another crits.
[11855.56s -> 11858.53s]  Just totally wasted.
[11858.53s -> 11860.03s]  I died.
[11860.03s -> 11862.19s]  We probably would have killed at least three people.
[11863.73s -> 11869.81s]  But only you had just screamed.
[11870.65s -> 11873.09s]  Well, that's that's your activation, not mine.
[11875.55s -> 11878.15s]  Yeah, and I'm the medic and I want my activation.
[11878.75s -> 11881.55s]  I get to call the shots.
[11881.55s -> 11884.38s]  The medic has the power.
[11884.38s -> 11885.62s]  You never knew that.
[11885.62s -> 11887.62s]  There's somebody, there's a spy.
[11887.62s -> 11890.83s]  They're all behind us.
[11890.87s -> 11893.90s]  What the fuck?
[11893.90s -> 11896.54s]  It really has just been all spies.
[11898.02s -> 11906.63s]  I'm every game.
[11906.63s -> 11913.63s]  Oh, I have one help.
[11913.63s -> 11919.31s]  I got the crits.
[11919.31s -> 11920.83s]  Where's Papa Papa?
[11920.83s -> 11929.92s]  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[11929.92s -> 11933.62s]  I don't trust it, but who knows?
[11933.62s -> 11936.56s]  OK, all right.
[11940.29s -> 11942.03s]  Not yet.
[11942.03s -> 11943.95s]  Uh huh. I'll know.
[11952.58s -> 11953.90s]  Dude, I don't play this game.
[11953.90s -> 11955.06s]  I don't play this game that often.
[11955.06s -> 11955.90s]  It's never you should never do it.
[11955.90s -> 11959.94s]  Don't ever do that again.
[11959.94s -> 11960.82s]  Germa, I've got the crits.
[11960.82s -> 11961.82s]  Where are you?
[11965.85s -> 11970.14s]  Damn it.
[11970.14s -> 11972.06s]  They were also spread out and I was so paranoid
[11972.06s -> 11977.58s]  I was going to get backstabbed.
[11977.58s -> 11981.76s]  Well, you know what they say?
[11981.76s -> 11993.39s]  Your responsibility is a 10.
[11993.39s -> 12006.18s]  Oh, I'm going to change to the pen.
[12006.54s -> 12008.34s]  Equip the pen. Equip the pen.
[12008.34s -> 12010.18s]  Heavy seems like a really stupid idea right now,
[12010.18s -> 12011.30s]  because it's just spies.
[12011.30s -> 12014.22s]  It does. Just circling us like don't do it.
[12014.62s -> 12016.26s]  Don't do it. I'm going to do it.
[12016.26s -> 12017.94s]  I'm going to do the heater.
[12017.94s -> 12019.34s]  Oh, my goodness.
[12019.38s -> 12021.88s]  They ain't going to fucking get near us now.
[12021.88s -> 12023.12s]  He's brilliant.
[12023.12s -> 12026.02s]  They won't simply just walk through it
[12026.02s -> 12037.26s]  and then never, ever, ever die.
[12037.26s -> 12047.21s]  At least we can see where they are.
[12047.21s -> 12057.46s]  I need I need mana.
[12057.46s -> 12058.62s]  Don't backstab me. Don't backstab me.
[12058.62s -> 12061.34s]  Don't backstab me, please.
[12061.34s -> 12070.71s]  Why would you eat it into the wall?
[12070.71s -> 12073.91s]  Did I just get crit with a was it a random crit?
[12073.91s -> 12076.19s]  Yep. And then I turned around and there was a spy.
[12076.19s -> 12077.39s]  There's a spy. There's a spy.
[12077.39s -> 12078.55s]  There's a spy. There's a spy.
[12078.55s -> 12079.67s]  There's a spy.
[12079.67s -> 12080.95s]  There's a spy.
[12080.95s -> 12082.23s]  There's a spy.
[12082.23s -> 12084.11s]  There's a spy.
[12085.35s -> 12087.83s]  Are there any other classes in this game?
[12087.83s -> 12089.78s]  We're fine.
[12089.78s -> 12091.78s]  I spawn new spy.
[12091.78s -> 12095.22s]  We're fine.
[12095.22s -> 12102.58s]  Demo player left.
[12102.58s -> 12108.64s]  Oh, my God.
[12108.64s -> 12111.50s]  I even was looking around for him.
[12111.50s -> 12113.02s]  I'm surrounded by fucking fire.
[12113.02s -> 12118.09s]  What the hell happened there?
[12118.09s -> 12120.73s]  They can still stab you if you're surrounded by fire
[12120.73s -> 12122.01s]  that deals three damage.
[12122.01s -> 12125.34s]  Yeah, but he shouldn't they light on fire?
[12125.34s -> 12126.70s]  I thought that was the whole point.
[12126.70s -> 12129.69s]  It's not constant.
[12129.69s -> 12131.17s]  Like, there's there's like pulses.
[12131.17s -> 12133.93s]  They can get in between the hole.
[12133.93s -> 12152.09s]  It's all that common.
[12152.09s -> 12154.26s]  I'll take care of it.
[12154.26s -> 12156.90s]  Got him.
[12156.90s -> 12170.31s]  Thanks, Frank, the tank.
[12170.31s -> 12172.11s]  That person's item says, hey, star,
[12172.11s -> 12174.63s]  like, I'm going to kill your head or something.
[12174.63s -> 12177.23s]  That's a threat I can sue.
[12177.23s -> 12193.73s]  How did they can't kill my head?
[12193.73s -> 12195.49s]  Nobody messing around here.
[12195.49s -> 12197.13s]  You want to crit for who are you?
[12197.13s -> 12199.25s]  I'm a pyro. I don't think it's a good idea.
[12199.25s -> 12205.79s]  I think it's a great idea.
[12205.79s -> 12208.09s]  But where are you?
[12208.09s -> 12216.56s]  Dead at the moment.
[12216.56s -> 12218.32s]  I'm going to see Barbie tonight.
[12218.32s -> 12221.47s]  Nice.
[12221.47s -> 12225.29s]  Let's watch Barbie together.
[12225.29s -> 12231.94s]  Good if you really wanted to.
[12231.94s -> 12235.42s]  Because Vegas have like a giganto theater
[12235.42s -> 12236.78s]  where you can buy out the whole thing
[12236.78s -> 12240.05s]  and it can just be us in it.
[12240.05s -> 12241.61s]  Why would you want to do that?
[12241.61s -> 12247.33s]  Because no one will see us hold hands.
[12247.33s -> 12248.41s]  Let's go.
[12248.41s -> 12252.80s]  Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go.
[12252.80s -> 12254.36s]  I just got crit by that shotgun.
[12254.36s -> 12258.94s]  God damn.
[12258.94s -> 12260.90s]  They kind of just get them.
[12260.90s -> 12265.19s]  That's so funny.
[12265.19s -> 12286.53s]  I was dead anyway, so it's all right.
[12286.53s -> 12287.17s]  Oh, should I?
[12287.17s -> 12290.34s]  At least I helped his dead body, apparently.
[12290.34s -> 12292.63s]  Yeah, thank you, Frank.
[12292.63s -> 12295.15s]  Really going to start calling you Frank a lot.
[12295.15s -> 12299.50s]  That's fine.
[12299.50s -> 12301.38s]  Yeah, I know the streamer like that.
[12301.38s -> 12305.39s]  I can call him by his first name.
[12305.39s -> 12307.41s]  What is it?
[12307.41s -> 12308.89s]  OK, do we get him?
[12308.89s -> 12311.74s]  We got a big deal or anything to me, though.
[12311.74s -> 12315.70s]  Frank, not doing bad.
[12315.70s -> 12320.34s]  We're doing fine.
[12320.34s -> 12320.86s]  I'm dead.
[12320.86s -> 12323.60s]  I don't want to play medic anymore.
[12323.60s -> 12326.39s]  You know what I mean?
[12326.39s -> 12330.42s]  You ever just reach your limits?
[12330.42s -> 12342.89s]  What the fuck?
[12342.89s -> 12347.91s]  Watch that door.
[12347.91s -> 12350.69s]  I'm watching it.
[12350.69s -> 12351.49s]  I need ammo.
[12351.49s -> 12360.34s]  Is there a dispenser over here?
[12360.34s -> 12364.20s]  Oh, I need dispenser.
[12364.20s -> 12366.12s]  Where's the dispenser?
[12366.12s -> 12369.88s]  I need a dispenser.
[12369.88s -> 12372.64s]  There are other sources of ammo.
[12372.64s -> 12379.72s]  I know, I got it.
[12379.72s -> 12380.88s]  That's a lot of Pyros.
[12380.88s -> 12391.57s]  That's a lot of Uber.
[12391.61s -> 12395.70s]  That's the biggest piss I've ever taken for men.
[12395.70s -> 12399.61s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[12399.61s -> 12409.34s]  I haven't hit anyone with this.
[12409.34s -> 12411.36s]  Are you using the pen?
[12411.36s -> 12413.74s]  The pen?
[12413.74s -> 12416.17s]  Are you actually using it?
[12416.17s -> 12416.93s]  The what?
[12416.93s -> 12418.57s]  The pen.
[12418.57s -> 12421.83s]  I put the pen.
[12421.83s -> 12424.30s]  Please, Jerma.
[12424.30s -> 12437.44s]  I will before the stream ends.
[12437.44s -> 12448.10s]  Help, help.
[12448.10s -> 12453.30s]  I'm going to hit someone.
[12453.30s -> 12454.85s]  Just wait.
[12454.85s -> 12463.03s]  I feel like I haven't been hitting anybody either.
[12463.03s -> 12467.78s]  Wait, this is a bunch of ammo down here, isn't there?
[12467.78s -> 12470.43s]  Full box, yes.
[12470.43s -> 12473.44s]  Do you know that when you kill people, they drop ammo boxes?
[12473.44s -> 12475.16s]  I have to kill them, though.
[12475.16s -> 12483.63s]  I want to be sure to have the sure thing.
[12483.63s -> 12489.16s]  Just letting you know, not a lot of people have played this game.
[12489.16s -> 12492.48s]  No one really knows what's going on right now.
[12492.48s -> 12493.68s]  We could explain it.
[12493.68s -> 12494.32s]  We should.
[12494.32s -> 12496.60s]  You want to do like a class in TF2?
[12496.60s -> 12498.13s]  Sure.
[12498.13s -> 12499.45s]  You want to be the teacher?
[12499.45s -> 12505.26s]  Well, they're going to have to pay up.
[12505.26s -> 12515.38s]  $60 an hour lessons for TF2 esports coaching.
[12515.42s -> 12517.75s]  Let's go.
[12517.75s -> 12521.63s]  I'm not even aiming near people.
[12521.63s -> 12528.71s]  I'm cracking out right now, dude.
[12528.71s -> 12532.54s]  What am I doing?
[12532.54s -> 12536.42s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[12536.42s -> 12540.02s]  I'm fine.
[12540.02s -> 12544.73s]  Is there just a Spencer around here?
[12544.73s -> 12546.97s]  I kind of cracked out a little.
[12546.97s -> 12548.97s]  You're kind of cracking a little bit.
[12548.97s -> 12556.96s]  Your skin's kind of cracking.
[12556.96s -> 12562.10s]  I'm going for at least number three on the scoreboard this round.
[12562.10s -> 12567.49s]  Or honorary mention.
[12567.49s -> 12572.44s]  What the fuck did he just wait?
[12572.44s -> 12573.36s]  What's going on up there?
[12573.36s -> 12574.20s]  Did I stop doing that?
[12574.20s -> 12574.84s]  Oh, they're having fun.
[12574.84s -> 12582.14s]  OK, never mind.
[12582.14s -> 12591.72s]  Yeah, well, hey, this server, this server.
[12591.72s -> 12596.12s]  I didn't kill them in 10 seconds going.
[12596.12s -> 12603.50s]  It's all or nothing time.
[12603.50s -> 12605.38s]  Yeah, I was aiming at you.
[12605.38s -> 12607.97s]  Here it comes.
[12607.97s -> 12610.69s]  Oh, I didn't get up there.
[12610.69s -> 12612.98s]  Thirty nine points.
[12612.98s -> 12615.62s]  Would you have forty four or fifty two?
[12615.62s -> 12621.76s]  I think I hit two arrows.
[12621.76s -> 12623.26s]  That was fun.
[12623.26s -> 12626.11s]  This game is fun.
[12626.11s -> 12627.65s]  Have you played it before?
[12627.65s -> 12634.43s]  Briefly, I think I'm going to go.
[12634.43s -> 12638.31s]  Who would have thought a simple game like this would have bred
[12638.31s -> 12641.59s]  the sexiest, most attractive streamer on Twitch?
[12641.59s -> 12643.11s]  You're on to this today.
[12643.11s -> 12644.51s]  This is like your thing today.
[12644.51s -> 12645.71s]  I don't know why.
[12645.71s -> 12647.71s]  Why is this your thing today?
[12647.71s -> 12651.23s]  It really all just comes back to Team Fortress 2.
[12651.23s -> 12653.03s]  Why is this your thing today?
[12659.54s -> 12666.33s]  I'm going to just be a dickhead this round, so see if I can make it happen.
[12666.37s -> 12667.77s]  I'm going to be a dickhead this round.
[12667.77s -> 12670.22s]  What does that mean?
[12670.22s -> 12682.58s]  Yeah, you two spies think you're so fucking smart.
[12682.58s -> 12684.86s]  I'm going to click their head real gun.
[12684.86s -> 12686.10s]  OK, I really.
[12686.10s -> 12687.82s]  Wait, the good spies on our team now.
[12687.82s -> 12697.46s]  Oh, my God, that's amazing. Thank God.
[12697.46s -> 12701.22s]  You better go get them.
[12701.22s -> 12704.58s]  You better really step up this round.
[12704.58s -> 12711.88s]  No excuses, man.
[12711.88s -> 12723.15s]  All right, let's go really step up, bro.
[12723.15s -> 12725.43s]  This is bullshit. You're trying to pull on me right now.
[12725.43s -> 12729.99s]  Did you hear the rumor, by the way, that they're adding another class to the game?
[12729.99s -> 12732.07s]  I did not. I think that you made it up.
[12732.07s -> 12734.19s]  It's going to be like a dog.
[12736.43s -> 12737.15s]  There's like a dog.
[12737.15s -> 12739.67s]  There's like a mechanical thing on its back.
[12739.67s -> 12742.87s]  People just brought it into the train.
[12742.87s -> 12750.71s]  It ate like three people.
[12750.71s -> 12752.81s]  Shit, should have turned around.
[12752.81s -> 12754.53s]  And the train hit people.
[12754.53s -> 12756.82s]  The dog class. Yeah.
[12758.40s -> 12762.20s]  What would the dog class's loadout default loadout be?
[12765.26s -> 12768.37s]  The woofer. OK.
[12768.37s -> 12771.81s]  Is this like an arcing lightning wand or something?
[12772.65s -> 12774.39s]  What are you talking about?
[12774.39s -> 12777.05s]  What does it do?
[12777.05s -> 12779.37s]  I'd have to go. There's a meet the dog that leaked.
[12787.35s -> 12791.20s]  Oh, nice. Oh, oh, there's too many people on the cart.
[12791.20s -> 12792.76s]  The spies here somewhere.
[12796.67s -> 12798.47s]  Dude, I fucking popped off a little bit right there.
[12798.47s -> 12806.10s]  It's all right.
[12806.10s -> 12807.78s]  All right. For those that have no idea,
[12807.78s -> 12812.29s]  because it is actually probably worth explaining some of these things explain,
[12812.73s -> 12815.73s]  explain with if I kill somebody with these gloves,
[12816.17s -> 12818.65s]  I get 100 percent crits for five seconds.
[12819.26s -> 12822.93s]  I then because it's not very much time, you can either keep these on.
[12822.93s -> 12824.89s]  I like to go to the family business.
[12824.89s -> 12826.05s]  This is a shotgun.
[12826.05s -> 12828.27s]  You get 100 percent crits on any weapon.
[12828.27s -> 12830.79s]  And this thing has a bunch of clips and you can pretty much get,
[12831.23s -> 12834.55s]  I would say, all eight shots out in that five seconds.
[12837.57s -> 12846.04s]  Fat scout. Yeah, it's pretty fun.
[12847.13s -> 12849.13s]  There's definitely a lot of people that probably don't really know.
[12849.13s -> 12854.15s]  So sincerely speaking, it's probably not a bad idea to teach them.
[12854.15s -> 12857.23s]  Well, because people you know this as well as I do.
[12857.67s -> 12860.79s]  A lot of people jump into this game and they get backstabbed
[12860.79s -> 12862.03s]  and then they uninstall the game.
[12862.03s -> 12864.35s]  They're just like, what the fuck was that? This game's stupid.
[12865.43s -> 12868.95s]  But like, if you kind of knew like kind of what was going on
[12868.95s -> 12874.13s]  and just like why and I know what's going on, I'm uninstalling afterwards.
[12874.73s -> 12878.52s]  No, you're not.
[12878.52s -> 12881.80s]  And these hit someone.
[12881.80s -> 12889.62s]  Oh, let's fucking go.
[12889.62s -> 12895.87s]  W I got a lot of fucking health.
[12906.20s -> 12908.72s]  How many dead skin cells are built up on your mouse buttons?
[12909.36s -> 12911.48s]  I clean my mouse all the time, actually, so not very much.
[12913.07s -> 12915.94s]  I'm actually clean my mouse.
[12915.94s -> 12917.58s]  I'm going to check.
[12917.58s -> 12918.54s]  I'm going to validate.
[12918.54s -> 12924.62s]  Go for it.
[12924.62s -> 12935.02s]  All right, let me make my dumb build happen.
[12935.02s -> 12944.60s]  Oh, I'm real. Help, help, help.
[12948.31s -> 12953.12s]  How did that not hit?
[12953.12s -> 12954.32s]  That shot him right in the chest.
[12954.32s -> 12959.01s]  It didn't even do any damage.
[12959.01s -> 12963.20s]  Despite their losing a lot.
[12981.38s -> 12984.42s]  You're real.
[12984.42s -> 12987.74s]  It's the whole frontier payload feels like a spy
[12988.54s -> 12990.46s]  all the time when you're on it.
[12990.46s -> 12992.46s]  It's so big. I heard a clunky.
[12992.46s -> 12994.14s]  I heard a
[13005.22s -> 13008.38s]  you got to dodge in real life.
[13008.38s -> 13010.78s]  That guy just blew up into the wall. What?
[13010.78s -> 13012.50s]  That's weird.
[13032.51s -> 13036.31s]  Oh, that was a big crit hit everybody.
[13040.81s -> 13043.09s]  All right. I'm going for the actual heavy now.
[13051.97s -> 13054.13s]  Have you opened any cases or crates or anything?
[13054.81s -> 13056.85s]  Oh, I told you I did.
[13056.85s -> 13059.54s]  But how many? How many?
[13059.54s -> 13063.18s]  Oh, five.
[13063.18s -> 13069.68s]  Whoa. OK, that was more than I thought.
[13069.68s -> 13078.24s]  I did not know these windows were here.
[13078.24s -> 13079.80s]  OK, I'm going to try the Liberty launcher.
[13079.80s -> 13081.96s]  You say this is like the best weapon, right?
[13081.96s -> 13084.34s]  Yeah, like pound for pound.
[13084.34s -> 13089.54s]  This is the like, wow.
[13089.54s -> 13091.98s]  Yeah, I don't think anything in the game compares to it.
[13091.98s -> 13105.90s]  OK, that's right.
[13105.90s -> 13114.87s]  I think I jumped into that.
[13114.87s -> 13122.23s]  But I like the sound it makes.
[13122.23s -> 13126.10s]  We're getting this.
[13126.10s -> 13133.09s]  Get out of the way.
[13133.09s -> 13140.13s]  Who's opening the door?
[13140.13s -> 13144.66s]  Where's the sentry up? Sentry's almost gone.
[13149.31s -> 13150.39s]  Oh, there's a second one. Shit.
[13150.39s -> 13154.55s]  You know, it's over there.
[13154.55s -> 13159.36s]  I got it.
[13159.36s -> 13167.64s]  We're the same as how walls go fast.
[13174.05s -> 13179.54s]  Well, this is the door you're talking about.
[13179.54s -> 13182.18s]  Astrology.
[13182.18s -> 13184.66s]  Did you believe in astrology, girl?
[13184.66s -> 13189.40s]  Um, I mean, like stuff like Orion's Belt.
[13190.87s -> 13193.91s]  Like that, there's stars in the sky and that like the universe is real.
[13195.02s -> 13198.88s]  And there's like the universe is expanding and all that.
[13198.92s -> 13201.50s]  Oh, my goodness.
[13201.50s -> 13204.87s]  I lost him.
[13204.87s -> 13206.03s]  I had to pay attention to it.
[13206.03s -> 13209.52s]  I'm sorry. I had crits.
[13209.52s -> 13210.52s]  This is sentry over there.
[13210.52s -> 13214.97s]  OK. Astronomy or astrology?
[13215.49s -> 13219.96s]  Astrology.
[13219.96s -> 13222.92s]  You're talking about like, like,
[13224.36s -> 13228.09s]  ergo and like the Milky Way.
[13230.23s -> 13234.16s]  Um, all of that.
[13234.16s -> 13242.20s]  Um, I mean, I know we have like stars and planets and people gave them
[13242.20s -> 13247.32s]  certain names and certain like attributes.
[13247.44s -> 13248.56s]  I don't know.
[13248.56s -> 13252.33s]  Do you think they gave them bad names?
[13252.33s -> 13254.48s]  What do you mean, bad names?
[13254.48s -> 13256.24s]  I don't think they're bad.
[13256.24s -> 13258.60s]  OK. Yeah, wait, I think you're.
[13258.60s -> 13261.20s]  So you believe in astrology?
[13261.20s -> 13263.24s]  I think you're mixing up two things.
[13265.04s -> 13269.13s]  I'm not.
[13269.13s -> 13270.37s]  Astrology is Zodiac.
[13270.37s -> 13272.55s]  Astronomy is stars and shit.
[13272.55s -> 13283.99s]  Zodiac's the killer.
[13283.99s -> 13286.73s]  Liberty launcher.
[13286.73s -> 13288.65s]  How's it serving you?
[13288.65s -> 13290.89s]  I think it's fine.
[13290.89s -> 13294.05s]  I mean, I can't tell anything bad about it.
[13300.16s -> 13308.17s]  Oh, my goodness.
[13308.17s -> 13318.22s]  I didn't kill anybody.
[13318.22s -> 13325.46s]  Why did I do 100 damage to that guy?
[13325.46s -> 13328.61s]  The Liberty launcher sucks.
[13328.61s -> 13331.37s]  Oh, are you trying to get me to use like a weapon that's bad or something?
[13331.77s -> 13333.49s]  I don't think it's bad.
[13333.49s -> 13341.05s]  What's wrong with it?
[13341.05s -> 13344.65s]  Nothing. You trust me or you just a random guy in chat.
[13345.45s -> 13347.69s]  I mean, it's like 20,000 random people.
[13355.41s -> 13357.73s]  Where did that even where did he even shoot that from?
[13368.10s -> 13370.10s]  I'm going to start to like I'm going to start to walk forward
[13370.10s -> 13372.22s]  and then walk backwards and then walk forward again.
[13375.46s -> 13377.78s]  What what was what astrology sign are you?
[13380.02s -> 13384.37s]  Ergo, they're pretty compatible with Leo's.

[14902.62s -> 14905.70s]  touches my side I like spasm and freak out it's like not a tickle it's like a
[14905.70s -> 14914.37s]  like a I don't know it's beyond it's beyond tickle and Ashley says yeah I
[14914.37s -> 14921.14s]  know where it is smile she does my mom was also acutely aware of where it was
[14921.14s -> 14926.84s]  and she would torment me because like it's not like oh tickles it's like if
[14926.84s -> 14934.23s]  you just put a finger there I like I just freak out it really feels like my
[14934.23s -> 14939.75s]  in my internal organs do like a 180 like it's they all shift it is it's weird
[14939.79s -> 14946.61s]  somebody in all caps just said can we change the subject what do you mean
[14946.61s -> 14952.89s]  every person in your chat in the world has been tickled why can't we talk
[14952.89s -> 14961.73s]  about it we are extensively by the way does that a problem no I'm just laughing
[14961.73s -> 14966.43s]  because somebody said it in all caps okay change the subject what do you got
[14966.43s -> 14971.23s]  your ADD riddled brain is gonna just start talking about what spies in front
[14971.23s -> 14974.55s]  of you in like two seconds I can't hold a conversation with you for a minute
[14974.55s -> 14977.39s]  what else what other was what are you gonna switch the topic that was way
[14977.39s -> 14981.75s]  longer than a minute that was at least five minutes that's the first one today
[14981.75s -> 14993.50s]  because I was very persistent and now Chad's mad that I was persistent how big
[14993.50s -> 15003.90s]  do you want a pepperoni you just tickled me hey what the fuck big pepperonis
[15003.90s -> 15015.08s]  kind of creep me out actually true I agree with you on that one and I had
[15015.08s -> 15018.64s]  there's a there's a middle ground because I also had small pepperonis yeah
[15018.68s -> 15023.20s]  and they cook and they like curl up into like moon craters and they just house
[15023.20s -> 15028.08s]  every ounce of grease from the pizza cooking and it's just if you if I eat
[15028.08s -> 15034.24s]  like one or two of them I start feeling like I'm gonna die yeah too many
[15034.24s -> 15041.07s]  pepperonis is yeah I agree especially large pepperonis no I like the really
[15041.07s -> 15045.76s]  small ones because they fit on pizza really well I don't like when the entire
[15045.80s -> 15055.52s]  pizza looks like Kaled no I like when pepperonis they're small and to get it
[15055.52s -> 15059.44s]  at least a few in like every other bite but no no don't get don't turn that
[15059.44s -> 15065.08s]  shit into Kaled no thank you are you a fan of any type of pizza that does not
[15065.08s -> 15073.90s]  use like a mozzarella tomato sauce yeah like a white pizza yeah it can be good
[15074.06s -> 15082.97s]  what's your ultimate alternative pizza um oh let's go hold on this guy's
[15082.97s -> 15090.31s]  friendly uh I don't think there's very many other than that what's another like
[15090.31s -> 15094.55s]  alternative pizza that's like a not mozzarella not traditional hold on I'm
[15094.55s -> 15098.47s]  gonna think about this just just not like tomato sauce oh yeah barbecue
[15098.47s -> 15102.02s]  chickens pretty good I used to have one I can't remember what it was and I'm
[15102.02s -> 15106.78s]  really sad I'm gonna say it randomly and then I would just know that that's what
[15106.82s -> 15112.34s]  I like does buffalo chicken have red sauce on it I think sometimes it depends
[15112.34s -> 15121.07s]  on where you get it I mean the color isn't the relevant component oh I went
[15121.07s -> 15130.24s]  blind I think it was like a garlic piece yeah buffalo chicken pizza is great
[15130.24s -> 15134.94s]  anyway you get it stir looks cute you should compliment him stir apparently
[15134.94s -> 15144.33s]  you look cute right now is that true I don't I don't like the term cute for me
[15144.85s -> 15154.78s]  you know what I mean yeah I feel you I like things like if you call me big and
[15154.78s -> 15166.49s]  chunky and gigantic and huge that's way better that's I'm not a bass that's
[15166.49s -> 15176.34s]  better yeah oh you want to be called big and chunky and huge yes oh I mean I get
[15176.38s -> 15180.42s]  for like working out maybe I get it not even like working out here's the thing
[15180.42s -> 15184.08s]  because if you're like oh you're so cute I feel like it's kind of disingenuous
[15184.08s -> 15187.58s]  and it kind of just glosses over the reality so I'd rather someone
[15187.58s -> 15191.90s]  acknowledge the reality of like you're kind of fucking you're chunky man I'm
[15191.90s -> 15196.02s]  like that's that's really me and I I like me like I don't care I'm a little
[15196.02s -> 15199.38s]  you know but it's like you're acknowledging that about me and I'm
[15199.38s -> 15208.60s]  like yep it's real it feels real you ever just hang out in the pool with your
[15208.60s -> 15218.36s]  bros and measure your thighs I did recently I got really big thighs you
[15218.36s -> 15225.06s]  even take out a tape measure and no we had a third party what are you talking
[15225.06s -> 15233.71s]  about today you you measured your thighs like how big they are well no I had
[15233.71s -> 15238.95s]  someone feel my thighs and someone feel short for size and compare it's going
[15238.95s -> 15255.40s]  on right now do you want to change the subject again as everything that I'm
[15255.40s -> 15261.12s]  interested in just like not okay no it's fucking funny hey bro so I don't the new
[15261.12s -> 15272.37s]  armored corps coming out that seems cool I know I didn't tell you to stop get
[15272.37s -> 15280.38s]  away from let him cook yeah my chat says in the text to speech I'm looking like
[15280.38s -> 15284.78s]  an entire jar of just extra chunky peanut butter today and I loved it
[15284.78s -> 15294.50s]  unironically absolutely just lit my day up mr. Jerma is hyper focused so stir
[15294.50s -> 15303.73s]  has free reign right now I can do anything I want I mean I'm I'm doing
[15303.73s -> 15308.48s]  alright I'm just having fun it's fun to run around and spray people with the
[15308.48s -> 15328.85s]  fire flamethrower I cannot let you get away with that oh he has a healer now
[15328.85s -> 15344.33s]  if you put pyro vision on oh you should feel like pyro visions the original
[15344.33s -> 15358.13s]  developer intended route what is your favorite movie of all time um it's hard
[15358.13s -> 15364.20s]  to pick one you know everyone's always concerned about favorites through but
[15364.20s -> 15370.04s]  like don't they all have like their own purpose and their own little spot in
[15370.04s -> 15373.96s]  your heart yeah your own little baby boo-boos like I want to watch this one
[15373.96s -> 15382.15s]  blah or I'd like this one for me yeah that's fair get out of here that I have
[15382.15s -> 15386.99s]  like the shortest memory possible for it and I forget movies that I like every
[15386.99s -> 15391.15s]  time I'm asked that question or like there's all the time where a movie will
[15391.15s -> 15397.31s]  come up I'm like oh yeah I do love that movie a lot can't remember it or like if
[15397.31s -> 15401.91s]  I'm just on the spot I think a lot of movies have come out so it's really easy
[15401.91s -> 15409.31s]  to kind of forget some of them even if you really like them yeah how spoiled
[15409.31s -> 15412.75s]  this I've had this thought many times how spoiled are we when we're all like
[15412.75s -> 15420.19s]  I'm so sad and I'm so bored and like I can't even remember all of the great
[15420.19s -> 15423.95s]  media that I love in a single moment I can't even sit here and be like what
[15423.95s -> 15428.61s]  movie do I like I don't fucking I got it's too hard to tell you all of the
[15428.61s -> 15435.92s]  things that are awesome how many games are on Steam I look this upward like
[15435.92s -> 15445.11s]  very recently what is it like 10,000 so you would have to play but that might be
[15445.11s -> 15452.14s]  outdated from like you would have to play like 30 games a day until you were
[15452.14s -> 15459.18s]  dead into if you couldn't play them all why do you want me to die I'm just
[15459.18s -> 15473.85s]  saying there's 50k now yeah I think that the number I saw was like 2018 or
[15473.85s -> 15480.36s]  something over 700,000 games I like bad movies that chattel disagree with me on
[15480.36s -> 15487.46s]  like mother I think mother was an awesome movie mother mother I never saw
[15487.46s -> 15494.20s]  I watched mother with you I love that movie all right let's go movie night
[15494.20s -> 15498.32s]  let's do it and if anyone who knows the movie the guy bouncing on the the
[15498.34s -> 15504.62s]  kitchen counter and she's like come on get off the counter that's like YouTube
[15504.62s -> 15512.04s]  comments to me at that point in my life I was like this guy's a YouTube commenter
[15512.04s -> 15520.38s]  Birdman you seen Birdman I have yeah it's great great movie come on we do it
[15520.38s -> 15526.38s]  again we can do another fucking movie four more movies in a row all these
[15526.38s -> 15532.91s]  idiots all these morons don't know what we're really capable of doing movies
[15532.91s -> 15543.84s]  about me I am Birdman you are Birdman I don't like there I don't like the ending
[15543.84s -> 15549.77s]  I had can in a different ending and they did rewrite the ending like we're
[15549.77s -> 15556.74s]  leaving right we're leaving yeah I just think Birdman is one of those movies
[15556.74s -> 15561.72s]  that the style of trying to shoot something pretending that it's all
[15561.86s -> 15567.64s]  essentially happening in a row even if it's not happening it still takes a lot
[15567.64s -> 15574.42s]  to get that to happen and make any sense it's like a great piece of cinema it's
[15574.42s -> 15583.46s]  very good it's it is like what I would describe for like a true movie like this
[15583.46s -> 15599.93s]  is a real movie this is a piece of cinema hidden cuts yeah that's fine
[15599.93s -> 15604.58s]  though there are at least a few times when Michael Keaton's walking around
[15604.58s -> 15609.63s]  going from space to space without a cut that even let me tell you something
[15609.93s -> 15615.16s]  coming from the YouTube world where you have to go like this you know what I
[15615.16s -> 15617.76s]  mean think about like the like all the YouTube videos ever seen and like I've
[15617.76s -> 15623.25s]  done this I do this all time this shit where it's like hey everybody welcome to
[15623.25s -> 15628.28s]  hey yeah we're back and here's another cut and oh and I fucked that up do it
[15628.28s -> 15636.60s]  again so at the end of the day the most important thing is to make sure that as
[15636.60s -> 15643.10s]  we go forward as a species we should always drink water right like it's almost
[15643.10s -> 15647.32s]  it's hard to actually go in the first half and we should drink water is where
[15647.32s -> 15652.23s]  I picked up as a species yes we should always drink water I agree yes but my
[15652.23s -> 15657.58s]  point is is that the youtuber shit where we cut every five to twelve seconds
[15657.58s -> 15664.50s]  because we don't remember what we're gonna say what's wrong with that it's
[15664.50s -> 15667.06s]  I'm just saying it's hard it's hard to go right in a row you know who does this
[15667.06s -> 15673.30s]  really well you know let me tell you something me no oh damn well you know
[15673.30s -> 15676.38s]  actually I think you're pretty good at this too but you know who's really
[15676.52s -> 15681.66s]  really good at this you one take is so fucking good at this and I don't even
[15681.66s -> 15687.18s]  know how the fuck he does it is Ludwig Ludwig will do like a 20 minute video
[15687.18s -> 15694.43s]  where he does not miss a single beat not a single beat and it's all one take I
[15694.43s -> 15699.72s]  don't even know how he does it it's actually a talent it's truly is and he
[15699.72s -> 15704.72s]  it's not like he's stopping he is full-on explaining something talking
[15704.72s -> 15708.72s]  addressing the camera it's fucking crazy what he does he can do it in one take
[15709.58s -> 15712.38s]  you probably would like Ludwig you guys should meet you you probably like them
[15712.38s -> 15722.44s]  versus sax and Hale yes no yeah why not let's try it well I think we have to
[15722.44s -> 15728.22s]  wait for this round done I will try to do that and I'll get like 30 seconds in
[15728.22s -> 15738.33s]  and be like fuck me and have to start the whole thing over again all if I do
[15738.33s -> 15743.90s]  it I feel like the video would be better if I didn't do it yeah but you do it
[15743.90s -> 15749.03s]  anyways you start over anyways there's been a couple times right like start
[15749.05s -> 15752.61s]  over multiple times and then I feel like I get one take because I've just said it
[15752.61s -> 15758.12s]  like eight times in a row yeah but even then I still think it would just like
[15758.12s -> 15764.16s]  why not cut why not cut like a second or two of dead space and that like you
[15764.16s -> 15768.94s]  know and also too if you'd go through one thing in one take there's a huge
[15768.94s -> 15774.06s]  possibility that you somewhere in that like five straight minutes you said
[15774.06s -> 15781.08s]  something that wasn't correct and it's like god damn it you left yeah okay
[15781.08s -> 15788.62s]  I realized it in one place sax and Hale. I love that was your idea and you're like nah never mind
[15788.62s -> 15795.79s]  well it put us in there and then you know but like getting something wrong in
[15795.79s -> 15800.11s]  the middle of a commentary like that or a talking like that then you you watch
[15800.11s -> 15803.59s]  it back and like wow I did pretty good job one take oh the thing I said at two
[15803.59s -> 15808.95s]  minutes is completely fucking wrong now what do I do just take a little cut and
[15808.95s -> 15814.69s]  put it in there and leave the rest or is that weird I mean is he I haven't seen
[15815.11s -> 15820.76s]  his videos is he full on camera 100% of the video or does like yeah it's so
[15820.76s -> 15825.20s]  he'll do like mobile mails or does something go over him where he can do
[15825.20s -> 15829.52s]  like a fake cut no I don't think so I think he just does it he just goes for
[15829.52s -> 15841.27s]  it man what a legend stop trying to make your boss sound good dude he is good he
[15841.27s -> 15848.77s]  is good what do you want to pretend he's not that's weird that's weirder that's
[15848.77s -> 15865.38s]  weirder for me to pretend that he's not I mean he I would say I think he is the
[15865.38s -> 15878.67s]  most attractive youtuber here we go again you cute us right yeah we're cute
[15878.67s -> 15884.08s]  all right good uh did you did you have a favorite movie you want to toss your
[15884.08s -> 15893.33s]  hat in gremlins 2 I'm about I'm hovering over the leave game I just I'm
[15893.33s -> 15905.89s]  threatening to leave the game explain why you just left I'll click it it's a
[15905.89s -> 15911.97s]  mixture of like shocking wow gremlins 2 is his favorite movie but then also like
[15911.97s -> 15920.52s]  it's funny cuz it fits yeah I feel like if you had the opportunity to have a pet
[15920.52s -> 15931.83s]  mug why you would gremlinify it because you think the gremlins are cuter he
[15931.83s -> 15941.24s]  gets it if you if you think that the gremlins are cute is that is that
[15941.24s -> 15946.79s]  appropriate I just think okay the gremlins to me are looney toons
[15946.79s -> 15951.77s]  characters they go from being these like cute little oh it's such a cute little
[15951.77s -> 15957.13s]  like kitten it's a cute little puppy to turning into a looney toons daffy duck
[15957.13s -> 15961.84s]  character I mean I like the looney toons daffy duck character more than
[15961.84s -> 15971.82s]  the like cute one I find that to be more interesting to me exactly full circle
[15971.82s -> 15974.82s]  that's why I don't want to be called cute and I'd rather be called a full tub
[15974.82s -> 15983.14s]  of jiff extra chunky peanut butter I feel it I'm gonna do you want to be the
[15983.14s -> 15986.42s]  cute gremlin or you want to be the cool gremlin I want to be the gremlin that

[16026.72s -> 16031.06s]  brain it that he didn't learn how to talk he drank a potion that made him
[16031.06s -> 16040.81s]  smarter and there was only one potion to drink of course there was only one

[16239.12s -> 16247.14s]  hats for the keys what is considered the the unusual now like what is like the
[16247.14s -> 16255.10s]  best one now any idea no clue I have never had any comprehension of the
[16255.10s -> 16260.65s]  unusual market after it like like ancient times it was like the green flame
[16260.65s -> 16264.91s]  and then once they started adding more I had no idea anymore people are still
[16264.91s -> 16271.84s]  saying ones yeah burning team captain oh okay I guess I still know damn really
[16271.84s -> 16277.60s]  even after all the updates no no new one is come on crates are rarer because
[16277.60s -> 16286.24s]  they're old it's true it's rare okay do you want it right when the door opens or
[16286.24s -> 16306.74s]  oh we're doing a Frank the fish are we hey let's do this let me know okay I'll

[16329.88s -> 16351.54s]  can't focus on it I fell you got you got a couple yeah I thought we get more but
[16351.54s -> 16360.14s]  I was nervous there's a lot of pyros I think it was still worth it yeah look at
[16360.14s -> 16364.98s]  the momentum that we're driving for our team right now oh he's the real power
[16364.98s -> 16373.60s]  it's me again hi there's a lot of people in this area by behind spy behind demo
[16373.60s -> 16380.28s]  right here there's way too I'm fucking running back spawn dude there's a
[16380.28s -> 16390.04s]  century in the water at our spawn what I got it
[16390.04s -> 16399.95s]  oh yeah they can't shoot out of the water so they only kill desperate losers
[16399.95s -> 16406.09s]  like me oh shit this is bad this is really bad I got stuck in the fucking
[16406.09s -> 16419.70s]  water help heal me medic help died help medic medic medic medic medic dude the
[16419.70s -> 16423.78s]  Liberty launcher is insane I don't even have to worry about it getting
[16423.78s -> 16429.73s]  reflected because it won't do any damage so is that is it bad and you that's the
[16429.73s -> 16433.27s]  thing what do you I feel like you're tearing in two different directions
[16433.27s -> 16442.03s]  there I believe in it I'm a believer I think it was no one believes in it it
[16442.03s -> 16446.55s]  does a lot less damage but someone at long range it scales down to 18 damage
[16446.55s -> 16452.65s]  oh that's why I was doing like 30 damage right yes oh this is scary there's a lot
[16452.65s -> 16456.07s]  of stickies here yes there is I'm not going over there yeah let's go on the
[16456.07s -> 16467.77s]  left side left side let's do this left side let's go left I have one make sure
[16467.77s -> 16507.36s]  you got full rockets it's dangerous I'm not playing pyro that's my class what
[16507.36s -> 16522.50s]  the hell am I doing sure mother there was a demo man in the water why am I
[16522.54s -> 16527.94s]  getting the receiving end of all this nonsense I changed class by the way yeah
[16527.94s -> 16568.66s]  you better I'm going I'm going whatever mode I'm going I'm going in fuck I don't
[16568.66s -> 16588.02s]  think it should be this hard to leave spawn yes accidental taunt cancel is
[16588.02s -> 16600.48s]  that what I did mouse plus W yeah well sometimes you have to they're the pyro
[16600.48s -> 16624.98s]  character someone said flog does not deserve hog log hog wow oh my oh my oh
[16624.98s -> 16631.20s]  my vlog this is all your fault I don't think it is considering I have you
[16631.20s -> 16642.60s]  needed I think you more point on medic I have more points than you okay that's my
[16642.60s -> 16657.72s]  game running like 30 FPS why is that is a good question I don't know I don't
[16657.80s -> 16664.59s]  think we it was only me knew that we're able to touch the point for like a
[16664.59s -> 16687.78s]  millisecond 64 gigs of RAM can't handle it leave so tell me how good how late are
[16687.78s -> 16693.72s]  you going how how much you like how much team fortress is enough for this addict
[16693.76s -> 16705.86s]  I think like another hour I'm having fun are you trying to get going I want to be
[16705.86s -> 16712.62s]  with you okay so let's keep playing I want a good engineer around a really
[16712.62s -> 16722.65s]  good one won't happen sorry man pyros fun this dragons this is what you said
[16722.65s -> 16737.21s]  you're using you like it the dragon's fury oh yeah oh yeah no more stamina I
[16737.29s -> 16757.72s]  did work out very early this morning long day get up early um 7 a.m. 10 a.m.

[16786.71s -> 16791.64s]  don't need the goggles why is gremlin 2 better than gremlins 1 gremlins 1 is
[16791.64s -> 16796.69s]  kind of a horror movie it's not really like a comedy it's sort of a oh I
[16796.69s -> 16800.57s]  remember okay because they did the gremlins do they like take over the TV
[16800.57s -> 16808.43s]  station they're all goofing around yeah Hulk Hogan's in it I like them both I
[16808.43s -> 16818.98s]  think they both really good just like second better comedy horror yeah the
[16818.98s -> 16828.04s]  second one is like full Looney Tunes though this pyro land to work in here no
[16828.04s -> 16841.27s]  but I'll keep the blower on why not I'm gonna play get pirate spy I'm gonna
[16841.27s -> 16849.96s]  ever played this map really this was like every single server one contract
[16849.96s -> 16863.76s]  came out oh no yeah okay I had to see outsider you know what I'm gonna be the
[16863.76s -> 16873.01s]  dead ringer guy when I die I'm just gonna play spy as a scout with a revolver
[16873.01s -> 16887.07s]  and just be immune to dying smart what is there somebody in the water so you're
[16887.43s -> 16911.84s]  okay you're going for it let's see it Wow dead ringer wins it did you actually
[16911.84s -> 16925.07s]  just do that no I just spawned and didn't get to do anything yet there you
[16925.07s -> 16932.72s]  go oh jeez love what does the happy camper on
[16932.72s -> 16940.91s]  sniper do these days no no lynching and yeah you get healed that's the big thing
[16940.91s -> 16959.59s]  you get healed for health every couple seconds I think pretty damn good shit
[16959.71s -> 16965.96s]  adjust your view model so we can see the goddamn game that's cuz I'm using the
[16965.96s -> 16985.48s]  rainbow thing I like it big same yeah I like it this games about to be over in
[16985.48s -> 16991.10s]  like two seconds are you all the way back there no I just feel like we're
[16991.10s -> 17022.00s]  rolling I'm just this is just bubbles everywhere guys running all over the
[17022.00s -> 17058.74s]  place we re queuing or what are you relieving can we do can we do one or
[17058.74s -> 17067.37s]  two on bunker hill no you haven't even done cell bling yet which one do you
[17067.37s -> 17072.76s]  like out of all them so everyone's gonna want you to experience saving okay
[17072.76s -> 17079.35s]  let's do it it's like the map from the update and I'm shocked it hasn't I even
[17079.35s -> 17083.03s]  tried to queue into it exclusively before I wasn't doing it I typically
[17083.03s -> 17090.63s]  always get it didn't they nerf the pumps and lay into the ground at one point I
[17090.63s -> 17099.42s]  guess I don't even remember what that thing does we play different I'm not an
[17099.42s -> 17105.26s]  engineer you really don't play it right and I don't play engineer I don't play
[17105.26s -> 17113.33s]  your your your spy very much your your medic so this is the one that when you
[17113.33s -> 17117.41s]  hit somebody with it the medic will lose up to ten percent in Medigun charge
[17117.89s -> 17128.31s]  really doesn't seem that bad I don't remember it having the on-hit victim
[17128.31s -> 17140.60s]  loses cloak it feels new but again I would not remember I'll try the short
[17140.60s -> 17143.60s]  circuit so now it's actually a projectile is not like electricity that
[17143.60s -> 17151.88s]  comes out of your hand so alt fire just what is the regular fire do anything
[17151.88s -> 17165.37s]  you know it still is electricity okay bro this is the worst loadout I could
[17165.37s -> 17178.84s]  possibly have well let's try to make it work why not what's your secondary
[17178.84s -> 17186.91s]  Thompson short-circuit and the Jag is that the worst possible engineer load
[17186.91s -> 17193.52s]  up I don't know the Jag seems intelligent that's wrong I could put on
[17193.52s -> 17204.26s]  the Eureka effect put on the Wrangler what is so bad about this actually it
[17204.26s -> 17208.84s]  looks like they buff the Eureka effect all like a lot I remember just being
[17208.84s -> 17214.44s]  kind of quirky that's your reload key to choose to teleport to spawn or your exit
[17214.44s -> 17221.30s]  teleporter minus 50% metal cost when constructing or upgrading oh that's
[17221.38s -> 17229.79s]  actually kind of good guys we can't get a cell blown in server they just don't
[17229.79s -> 17237.24s]  exist I'll try it don't use the pumps and you'd be better off turning your
[17237.24s -> 17246.17s]  monitor off and playing the game with your face Wow why they're doubting you
[17246.17s -> 17252.88s]  they are you can handle it they are doubting big-time yeah what did you
[17252.88s -> 17259.44s]  kiss you I'm trying to get us in the sale begin there we go I'm gonna I'm
[17259.44s -> 17262.76s]  gonna go get like a water after this my voice is like drying up I feel like I'm
[17262.80s -> 17268.72s]  gonna cough dust out in a second hmm so this maps is this maps a little bit
[17268.72s -> 17273.62s]  different this is a little bit of a mixture of Call of Duty's kill confirmed
[17273.62s -> 17280.76s]  with a zoo okay so what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna kill enemy
[17280.76s -> 17286.08s]  players and pick up fish but and then when the seal appears you want to feed
[17286.08s -> 17293.51s]  the seal the fish you collect okay I'm gonna play something else you already
[17293.55s -> 17304.12s]  gave up just not engineer I don't know what the hell's going on Wow so get
[17304.12s -> 17311.95s]  kills pick up seals pick up fish feed the fish to the seal okay and if you are
[17311.95s -> 17319.88s]  the leader if you hold the most fish then you will um you become a dispenser
[17319.88s -> 17324.12s]  effect for your team and the enemy team can like see where you are through wall
[17324.12s -> 17335.78s]  oh at the bottom left it'll if maybe I don't know your HUD if you see like a
[17335.78s -> 17342.09s]  random floating number those are people who have the fish I like that little
[17342.09s -> 17351.73s]  truck oh our seal is swimming around it's everybody's seal everybody needs to
[17351.73s -> 17356.41s]  feed the seal oh and the seal is an eldritch old god and it favors whichever
[17356.41s -> 17359.97s]  team feeds it more and then it banishes the other team from this mortal coil
[17359.97s -> 17370.03s]  which is the only part I've made up but it's the only reason why we'd be feeding the
[17370.03s -> 17400.58s]  seal and fighting over it oh shit no the medic was still there I don't get it at
[17400.58s -> 17407.48s]  all but I think I after a round or two I'll get it oh yeah it really is just
[17407.48s -> 17415.52s]  like it's not you'll see because the seal isn't always active so like right
[17415.52s -> 17420.00s]  now he's doing three two one seal feed the seal so that guy's 20th okay I get
[17420.00s -> 17424.62s]  it yeah yep yep you got to kill that guy and get that guy's fish because he's
[17424.66s -> 17452.56s]  feeding the fish pretty hard right now oh shit spy we're all the way back to the
[17452.56s -> 17460.77s]  spawn kind of well you got to feed this thing oh there we go who's got the most
[17460.77s -> 17482.33s]  fish it's by as by I got a banner I got a banner dude come on I feel like every
[17482.33s -> 17487.27s]  time I'm about to do click a good thing I get backstabbed every time maybe you
[17487.27s -> 17496.88s]  should look behind you I did maybe you should dude maybe you shouldn't be
[17496.88s -> 17515.42s]  streaming what the fuck that's a fucking spy right there guarantee it yeah he's
[17515.42s -> 17527.04s]  still alive he's not you don't he's he's like writer you see the guy with 11 you
[17527.04s -> 17534.72s]  gotta get these 11 oh my god I'm just gonna play pyro never change ever I feel
[17534.72s -> 17547.79s]  like I get I get I can play the game if I play pyro ooh this is cool okay we
[17547.79s -> 17560.75s]  gotta feed the steel steel time he comes out of the van seals and you have
[17560.75s -> 17570.04s]  to play the objective I'm surprised I didn't get that but I stopped spinning
[17570.04s -> 17601.58s]  so angry I got him okay how did they nerf the dead ringer when this shit
[17601.58s -> 17615.63s]  fucking disciplinary action whips you out of the danger zone how is that nerf
[17615.63s -> 17625.48s]  sounds like a skill issue to me well I'm using it right now that's how I noticed
[17625.60s -> 17638.65s]  insane it actually uh heavy is probably the worst possible thing to do but I'm
[17638.65s -> 17698.92s]  gonna do it give me that snack all right do I think I have it damn he got me Wow
[17698.92s -> 17712.79s]  I thought there's gonna be a spy right behind me there is turn around don't do
[17712.79s -> 17728.06s]  that I really thought you were serious I did see one what is going on I'm bad
[17728.06s -> 17745.92s]  focus just aim just actually aim that's a lot of fish there's no way wait drop
[17745.92s -> 17769.76s]  an item I think I'm safe I'm so not used to being able to feign death and cheat
[17769.76s -> 17779.87s]  life itself but I didn't do it oh I keep forgetting that I'm allowed to cheat I
[17779.87s -> 17829.93s]  think the sniper is the spy but it's this guy get out of here we good this
[17829.93s -> 17844.04s]  guy's got 29 holy shit
[17848.73s -> 17861.12s]  what is wrong with you we did it we're having a crisis you're having a meltdown
[17861.12s -> 17876.97s]  I keep getting killed by spies hey we did pretty good that was a good round we
[17876.97s -> 17884.83s]  won yeah I'd say pretty good is what you say when you lose but we actually won I
[17886.65s -> 17892.05s]  like in a spy I'm forgetting that I'm allowed to cheat death and and I keep
[17892.05s -> 17915.76s]  dying you're one of these people is a spy I'm certain of it hmm I think we
[17915.76s -> 17924.26s]  might need a little bit if I kind of need to see how bad the ambassador is now
[17924.26s -> 17934.98s]  for myself isn't the default revolver like it's really good it's it's pretty
[17934.98s -> 17944.50s]  good but it gets like random bullets spread after a shot and I just want to
[17944.50s -> 17980.08s]  aim it ahead god damn it 14 fishes all right this is where the fuck is that
[17980.08s -> 17987.70s]  spy knew it I knew I was like where the fuck did he go I don't want to do I
[17987.70s -> 18004.83s]  think I'm yeah I'm going for it I'm just gonna play it with the is a
[18004.83s -> 18014.19s]  teleporter evenness probably yeah not really not really on this map it helps
[18014.19s -> 18025.10s]  but it's not the most important thing on kind of close what's really important
[18025.10s -> 18087.89s]  is feeding this seal I guess I'll play pyro yay I was gonna tape my fucking
[18087.89s -> 18110.02s]  left mouse button down I'm bad at it I am bad at this one I didn't want to do
[18110.02s -> 18137.37s]  that give me a fucking break it's so not worth it I believe everyone okay let's

[18327.23s -> 18331.52s]  I was like what the hell is that and then the thunder rolled in that's why I
[18331.52s -> 18337.12s]  don't stop playing how often do you get like storms in Vegas um it happens
[18337.12s -> 18340.72s]  pretty frequently especially in summertime not a lot of rain but we'll
[18340.72s -> 18358.74s]  get like some pretty nasty lightning stuff the big eye thing finally awoke
