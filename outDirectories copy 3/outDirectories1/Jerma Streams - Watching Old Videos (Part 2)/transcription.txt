[0.82s -> 23.46s]  Alright, let me change this to just chatting. Well, they were going to fix it tomorrow,
[23.46s -> 30.73s]  apparently, so let's really hope that they do. Rage 2 stream? I don't need any more rage.
[30.73s -> 40.01s]  I'm at like rage 10. I'm not at a rage 2 out of 10. I'm at like an 8 out of 10 for rage.
[40.01s -> 43.05s]  Use transformer to complain about cocks. Alright, we might as well.
[44.39s -> 54.68s]  We just need like audio for that anyways. I told you not to do cocks. This is the only
[54.68s -> 58.68s]  company. There's two companies here. It's cocks of CenturyLink and they're both dog shit.
[60.34s -> 64.10s]  There's no, you can't win. You don't, you're there, you cannot win with North American
[64.10s -> 93.03s]  internet. You have to roll dice. Just start your own company. I have CenturyLink. It's dog shit.
[95.16s -> 99.56s]  Like Google Fiber and there's like, why do you think everyone's moving to one
[99.56s -> 103.48s]  fucking city in this country that's a streamer? Because it's the only place with like real
[103.48s -> 109.50s]  reliable like fiber and they're not even doing that anymore. Didn't they can that?
[109.50s -> 125.62s]  Remove shirt. Jerma's next up to be Sibyl's boyfriend? I don't know about that. Oh,
[125.62s -> 140.73s]  Jax net. Oh, it's because I'm right here. I see what you mean. I'm willing to let this
[140.73s -> 147.13s]  try to work itself out before I completely, you know, throw in the towel here.
[150.18s -> 170.42s]  Jax net. I need to move this camera. Hey, let's just stretch me out. I'll just look
[170.42s -> 192.20s]  bigger. Oh, that doesn't work. Alright, so what do you guys want to talk about?
[192.20s -> 207.99s]  Ask me anything. Ask ask me literally anything. What is that shaped hair? It's called ice cream
[207.99s -> 218.18s]  melting over the side of the cone. Ask for that next time you go there. You got a job as a
[218.18s -> 228.52s]  substitute and any tips for a substitute teacher job? Um, yeah, it's I would pass that down to
[228.52s -> 239.51s]  any generation that wanted it. Any generation? Would you consider yourself a 90s kid? I mean,
[239.51s -> 247.40s]  I was born in 85. I got to change the title here to like frames are depleting. Oh, is it already
[247.40s -> 258.28s]  there? I think we're there, right? Would you watch this clip earlier in the stream? What did
[258.28s -> 265.96s]  I do earlier in the stream? God, you're so old. Yeah, I don't claim to be young. I don't
[265.96s -> 273.50s]  claim to be like a young man anymore. Straight frames depleted streamer defeated. I like
[273.50s -> 285.30s]  that. That's a good one. I like that one. Frames depleted streamer defeated. This has
[285.30s -> 290.25s]  to be from like the wind we've been getting lately. And just like I could sit here and be like,
[292.98s -> 296.94s]  I can't I got to just did it just go down when I did that?
[307.56s -> 318.81s]  Watch some videos. Maybe we'll watch some videos. All these Fortnite streamers are hogging the
[318.81s -> 334.70s]  good internet. Capitalize the D and depleted right now. Oh, fuck, you're right. I got
[335.34s -> 346.62s]  pants on. Rank the Star Wars movies. Star Wars. Two. Star Wars. Four. Star Wars. Seven. Star Wars.
[347.48s -> 358.54s]  Three. Star Wars. One. Star Wars. Are we going from best to worst? Why did I rank
[358.54s -> 365.42s]  episode two as the best Star Wars? I thought which way were we going? What am I gonna do
[365.42s -> 375.75s]  the sequel to Otto's Big Adventure 2? Never. Never. Unless it's a joke for like 10 seconds.
[377.59s -> 388.81s]  He's calling football plays. What would you sacrifice for a perfect internet? The top of
[388.81s -> 394.44s]  this pinky here. Like that would see that with this this top of this knuckle. Just take it off.
[397.29s -> 415.32s]  I don't I don't need that. Do I I don't need that. From like here down. I was born.
[416.36s -> 420.36s]  Break out the red blend. No, I'm not drinking. I'm not. Why would I'm not going to start
[420.36s -> 426.31s]  drinking right now. That's not a sacrifice. I wouldn't even that's not a sacrifice. You
[426.31s -> 431.99s]  said I you said what would it take? And I said like the top half of my pinky. Well,
[431.99s -> 437.29s]  I don't know. Maybe like that's a sacrifice because it would be hard for me to grab stuff.
[441.32s -> 446.52s]  Break out the whiskey. No, no whiskey. No booze. No, I'm not like that upset about
[446.52s -> 453.85s]  this. I'm just like mildly irritated. I'm pretty upset by this. I'm actually very upset
[453.85s -> 461.99s]  by this. Don't let them fool you. Don't let me pretend. I'm like very upset by this.
[462.95s -> 481.58s]  Play Mario Yahtzee. We might. Maybe. Maybe. Why is your face cam so noisy?
[486.68s -> 495.93s]  Yeah, that's right. Why is this so shitty looking? Well, it's because
[497.05s -> 513.61s]  it's because of this. It's like in a weird resolution. Yeah, look at this. This is what
[513.61s -> 526.18s]  we're what resolution even is this. It's great because I'm like sitting down on it.
[526.34s -> 536.47s]  Here. There you go. How mad am I on a relaxed to Hotline Miami 2?
[539.67s -> 550.01s]  Maybe maybe like the first the first like four pages of Green Eggs and Ham. You know what I
[550.01s -> 563.62s]  mean? That's where I'd say I am on a scale of like upset. Clean the closet. I will tomorrow.
[563.62s -> 574.31s]  Have I seen any celebrities in Las Vegas? No, I mean, again, no. Again, it's not a
[574.31s -> 583.43s]  uh I've seen Criss Angel go like this. It's huge. It's like on every building.
[584.07s -> 602.44s]  How mad are you on a on the Richter scale? Like a mild. He still exists. Yeah, and apparently he
[602.44s -> 614.04s]  does. What's what's what's what's this? Let's watch some old videos. Yeah, let's watch some
[614.04s -> 630.07s]  old. Let's just chill. I'm defeated. 30,000 drop frames. That's too many. We've been
[630.07s -> 645.90s]  live for an hour. All right, let me set this up to get this to work. Let's um I had a friend
[645.90s -> 657.59s]  who believed everything Criss Angel did was actually magic. I mean, what is magic though?
[657.59s -> 671.40s]  Magic is it's just fooling and you know subversion, right? All right, let me put this
[671.40s -> 677.64s]  over here. What do you guys want to watch? What like you want to watch a video of mine?
[677.64s -> 689.34s]  You want to watch an old video? Should we like vote on these? I don't know how we would
[689.34s -> 702.46s]  vote on them. Put on a rat movie of Otto's Big Adventure. Watch yesterday's stream.
[712.57s -> 721.11s]  I'm not gonna watch yesterday's stream. That was a lot of fun, but watch death to spies.
[725.59s -> 732.62s]  Oh yeah, the with the graph. I forgot about this. This video has a million views.
[732.62s -> 743.03s]  Holy shit. Watch your least liked video. I don't know. I don't want to do that.
[747.58s -> 758.81s]  Your least liked video. Let's see. I don't even know. Can I even sort on a channel for that?
[759.37s -> 783.58s]  It's a little bigger. No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop it. Stop it. Okay,
[783.58s -> 793.30s]  I stopped it. So now let's put this on here. I should be able to turn it on.
[798.01s -> 804.22s]  Hey, this has this video has the same amount of likes that I have dropped frames today.
[804.22s -> 835.42s]  Let's full screen this death despise. This is an old one. Can I, I got to give myself a spot here,
[835.42s -> 842.82s]  right? This is the video that got you into the channel. Really? That's this is some of the
[842.82s -> 848.31s]  funniest fucking shit I think I ever saw in a video game. Can I not like just make this be
[848.31s -> 862.82s]  the whole screen? Why are you doing this? Come on. Come on. What are you doing? This is killing
[862.82s -> 868.65s]  me. All right, let's watch. Let's watch death despise. It's been a while since I've seen
[868.65s -> 886.09s]  this. In fact, I think it's been years since I've opened this video. Let's watch it. Okay.
[888.44s -> 898.09s]  Here we go. That's as loud as it can get. I feel like this would be louder.
[900.84s -> 909.32s]  And I'll make that louder. Guys, I don't do this. I never like do like videos on stream.
[914.39s -> 918.63s]  Is that getting louder for you guys? I think it is. Yeah, it is. All right, there we go.
[918.63s -> 933.98s]  That's better. Where am I supposed to bring this guy? This is a gigantic base with people
[933.98s -> 939.37s]  in it. How am I supposed to sneak him out? He's extract captive. Oh, the body can be
[939.37s -> 944.71s]  hidden in a truck. And that makes sense. Okay, well, you stay put. I'll be back.
[946.30s -> 953.70s]  I killed him. I've been sitting here for at least a few minutes, trying to figure out what exactly
[953.70s -> 959.16s]  this fucking guy is doing. Well, yeah, what the fuck is he? He's like cleaning down this
[959.16s -> 967.32s]  old rusty cabinet with his hands. Or is he looking for a stud? That's a good one. That's
[967.32s -> 981.66s]  a good one. Stop. Stop it, please. I had to do that. You had. Pause it. Pause it. I'll
[981.66s -> 988.06s]  give you some insight information here. So this is there was a spot here that I tried to go into,
[988.62s -> 995.35s]  like, probably 30 to 40 times. It took a long time to get in this exact area where I couldn't
[995.35s -> 1000.23s]  get shot. And this is where I figured out that people were just dumping into the room.
[1001.03s -> 1007.51s]  And I died so many times here trying to fit myself in this one spot to go underneath.
[1008.66s -> 1013.38s]  Because your head is underneath and they can't hit you. Yeah, it was like a pixel that you could
[1013.38s -> 1021.91s]  step on. Oh, he found me. He found me. He is trying to figure out how to shoot me right now.
[1023.83s -> 1030.31s]  Oh, shit. That you like that fucking hat over there. I can't seem to hit it. How do I hit
[1030.31s -> 1040.12s]  this fucking hat that's on the ground? You guys are so stupid. You can't hit the fucking.
[1040.12s -> 1045.27s]  All right. So here's another thing, right? I was trying to like set this up because I
[1045.27s -> 1050.10s]  thought this was funny. And the grenade coming into the room is something that I never prepared
[1050.10s -> 1061.64s]  for. There was no way I could have ever prepared for that. It was like no fucking way. I have
[1061.64s -> 1067.05s]  to do this a bunch more times. So I was trying to get them to miss me while I was the hat
[1067.05s -> 1071.69s]  on the ground. And it turned into this. So the hat on the ground. Is that what you're saying?
[1083.96s -> 1091.29s]  Flying by and dropping missiles on this place. Stop with the fucking.
[1097.86s -> 1105.77s]  Are you kidding me? Are you guys kidding me right now? People are all out of their minds.
[1106.49s -> 1112.01s]  They keep coming in here, realizing where I am. And then somebody throws a grenade into the
[1112.01s -> 1120.15s]  room and they have to leave. And some of them actually die. This shit was so fucking funny.
[1120.15s -> 1125.19s]  There he is. I found him. Oh, wait, Jerry, did you just throw a grenade into the room?
[1125.19s -> 1129.67s]  They all run out. They all like scatter. How much one of you morons is going to throw
[1129.67s -> 1138.78s]  the grenade? That's the question. We got the whole troop in here. Who is going to be the
[1139.26s -> 1150.76s]  finger moron that does it? Oh, get him. The hold up. I don't understand what the hold up is.
[1154.66s -> 1159.38s]  Was it you? Was it you? Somebody comes in and fucking throws it at her.
[1164.22s -> 1182.20s]  What's going on? Oh, put this gun over. He's like, what happened over here?
[1183.72s -> 1190.41s]  This dude, this guy aiming the gun that way. Throw it. Throw the grenade. Here we go.
[1190.89s -> 1195.53s]  This is my favorite one. Somebody comes in and throws it after I throw one, I think, right?
[1199.05s -> 1205.61s]  Yes, this guy went in here. He's sitting there standing looking.
[1208.17s -> 1211.93s]  You threw it into the wall. He throws it in and then he walks in the room.
[1213.21s -> 1216.41s]  I've just been reloading this over and over again. It's true. I was.
[1220.04s -> 1221.88s]  That guy didn't even attempt to get out of the way.
[1222.44s -> 1230.38s]  I forgot about that one. Something interesting. If you take a look at the guy that just stands
[1230.38s -> 1235.13s]  there and just goes, this is the best game ever, man. Like this is seriously one of the
[1235.13s -> 1245.78s]  funniest fucking, they don't make them like this anymore. That guy didn't even attempt to get
[1245.78s -> 1251.62s]  out of the way. Oh yeah. This next part too. I don't, I could like stream this game. I
[1251.70s -> 1261.37s]  probably could. But the next part where you're the chef and that's like a super disguise,
[1261.37s -> 1264.25s]  apparently. I don't know when nobody can see through it, right? Oh, no, no. Only one guy
[1264.25s -> 1269.32s]  could see through disguises. It was the chef. That's it. Something interesting. It was unfucking
[1269.32s -> 1273.16s]  real. Take a look at the mini map. You see all the green blobs. Those are all the people,
[1273.16s -> 1278.44s]  all the guards, all the hotel staff, all the people here cannot see through my disguise.
[1279.00s -> 1287.40s]  There's one red blip. Do you want to know who it is? The chef. There are other chefs in
[1287.40s -> 1296.46s]  here that can't see through. Right. So explain to me why other chefs couldn't see through my
[1296.46s -> 1306.38s]  disguise. One chef, everybody else. I don't get it. Throw a fucking plate in this guy's face.
[1314.86s -> 1318.98s]  This guy grabbed my leg. What is going on? What is hurting me?
[1323.93s -> 1330.84s]  Did I freeze in the freezer? Oh, don't tell me you can freeze in the freezer. Do not give
[1330.84s -> 1336.84s]  me that kind of power. Hey, Gary, just the man I wanted to see. Hey, look, can you go
[1336.84s -> 1340.92s]  ahead and grab me some extra kebabs from the fruit? What a fucking idiot. What an idiot.
[1341.64s -> 1353.53s]  I know. Do me a favor, Gary. Freeze. He's not freezing. Bullshit. This guy immune to cold.
[1354.50s -> 1358.18s]  This was horseshit. I was so mad about this. Why do I freeze in here, but he doesn't?
[1358.98s -> 1369.35s]  That's bullshit. Gary. I was hoping that that actually froze. The internet froze it.
[1369.99s -> 1377.43s]  Um, what I was actually hoping was going to happen there was that I could fill that freezer
[1377.43s -> 1380.87s]  with people. Just like have, just keep like throwing coins or whatever, throwing stuff in
[1380.87s -> 1383.99s]  there and they would just keep going in there and it would close the door and they would
[1383.99s -> 1390.66s]  just be in there. Would it feel weird recording a game for a video without a live audience
[1390.66s -> 1397.16s]  anymore? Yeah, probably. Because honestly, people say, oh, you don't, you know, I don't
[1397.16s -> 1404.20s]  make videos anymore, but this is the, I did this same shit off stream when I'd stream a game.
[1404.20s -> 1407.88s]  Now I just, I treat it the same way as if I was going to make a video on it essentially.
[1409.26s -> 1416.82s]  So it's, it's different, but it's also kind of the same. Now there's live feedback for
[1416.82s -> 1422.90s]  everything and I don't edit things out. I don't put things like in like graphic layovers
[1422.90s -> 1430.44s]  or sound or music or something, right? So it's, it's a, it's different, but it's also pretty,
[1430.44s -> 1440.36s]  it's very much the same too. So I play games off stream sometimes, not that much anymore though,
[1440.36s -> 1450.66s]  but here we go. The guy in the chair, he won't even suspect the goddamn thing. Oh yeah,
[1450.66s -> 1456.90s]  that's the guy that I was supposed to save. I was supposed to like go bug that guy or
[1456.90s -> 1465.37s]  something, right? I'm not even making sounds. I'm not doing anything in here.
[1467.34s -> 1471.72s]  Are you seriously wondering how that guy died? You opened the door and I did it.
[1472.44s -> 1480.74s]  Don't fuck with Jeff. Oh, $800. This part. My mission is to find the mole.
[1481.46s -> 1488.98s]  I've got to be quick. I've got to be silent and unseen. I find my target. He's this guy.
[1489.62s -> 1494.26s]  I throw a piece of china right in his mouth. Mission accomplished.
[1494.98s -> 1501.06s]  I can now escape undetected. This game was out of control. You know, I really wish they
[1501.06s -> 1506.74s]  would play something else. You're right, Jerry. And I agree. I think this piano player really
[1506.74s -> 1511.54s]  needs to shut the fuck up. Get some rock music in here. You know what I'm saying?
[1515.72s -> 1522.52s]  Was I spawning spoons? Where did I get these from? No, I was just taking them off the
[1522.52s -> 1525.48s]  tables. Right. I'm just being annoying right now. That's all I'm doing.
[1526.36s -> 1536.98s]  Just ruining these people's dinner. Oh, I forgot people just came in and pissed on you.
[1536.98s -> 1543.43s]  Excuse me. Are you serious? Occupied. Get out of here. What are you doing? Get away from me.
[1544.87s -> 1553.67s]  Oh, good afternoon. Yeah, there's somebody in this one. Yeah. No, somebody's still in it.
[1553.67s -> 1559.98s]  Thank you for understanding. Second time. Third time. He doesn't. He's going to piss in my
[1559.98s -> 1568.94s]  face. He just comes in. They don't care. The AI doesn't even know you're in there.
[1568.94s -> 1580.07s]  They just fucking pee. Grab that auto. I almost died making grab that auto. That last part.
[1580.07s -> 1587.32s]  It's been, I haven't seen these in a long time. It's been a very long time.
[1589.40s -> 1596.01s]  Grab that auto. All right, we'll do grab that auto. Oh, subscribe for more.
[1597.54s -> 1604.02s]  Four years ago, we've decided to tell you to do that, you know.
[1604.02s -> 1609.77s]  Role playing duck gamers. Oh, I forgot about that one too. I forgot about all these
[1609.77s -> 1615.85s]  videos. All right, give me, give me one second. I want to go grab, I want to grab
[1615.85s -> 1624.98s]  some water. I'll be right back. Also, again, thanks everybody for your patience and shit.
[1624.98s -> 1631.46s]  I'm sorry that we had to kind of dip out and do something else for a little while,
[1631.46s -> 1873.40s]  but I do, I really appreciate it. Let's move on. I'll be right back.
[1873.40s -> 1880.10s]  Oh fuck, it's getting worse, isn't it? Holy shit, it's getting worse.
[1888.90s -> 1895.14s]  I left at 40,000 drop frames and now there's 47,000 drop frames. Shit.
[1895.62s -> 1910.65s]  It's, we keep, we're hitting this like critical mass right now. All right, let's uh,
[1911.45s -> 1925.88s]  let's put on grab that auto five. Grab that auto five. You know what's one thing that's
[1925.88s -> 1934.46s]  interesting is the, is the view counts on some of these videos. Like I, grab that auto
[1934.46s -> 1942.52s]  five is four and a half million views. That's fucking crazy. I, that's, how? That's a lot.
[1943.16s -> 1961.27s]  It's interesting to go back and kind of see just how these videos have grown in a way. Fuck.
[1971.94s -> 1976.74s]  Guys, guys, this is not looking good. This is bad. This is like, I don't even,
[1977.46s -> 1992.42s]  this is not good. This is not good. Fuck. People watching more than once. Yeah, no,
[1992.42s -> 1996.92s]  that's, that's awesome. Like, I'm glad that people have been able to watch these videos
[1996.92s -> 2001.96s]  more than once and still like them and still watch them. It's, that's fucking cool. I'm glad
[2001.96s -> 2008.65s]  you like it that much. I had some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life
[2008.65s -> 2019.10s]  was making some of these videos. Most of them actually. So it's, don't give up. Don't give up.
[2020.14s -> 2025.59s]  Um, it may be time to give up.
[2033.14s -> 2044.79s]  It may be time to give up. Well, I'm going to stick it up for a little longer,
[2045.35s -> 2051.27s]  but it's getting worse as we go along here. We get, grab that auto on the screen.
[2051.99s -> 2056.79s]  Um, so if, if, if I might, I might get cut off completely here. So let me just tell you the
[2056.79s -> 2064.50s]  plan. Uh, if this does happen. So the plan, they're supposed to be like really looking
[2064.50s -> 2070.92s]  into this and fixing this tomorrow. So I'm going to take tomorrow off, let them just do
[2070.92s -> 2075.24s]  what they need to do. I'm going to stay on top of it and we're going to get it settled.
[2075.24s -> 2081.38s]  Right. So, but because this stream is going to be really all over the place and like
[2081.38s -> 2087.19s]  barely a stream, uh, after Monday, I'm going to try to come back on Tuesday
[2087.19s -> 2090.63s]  and we'll just go Tuesday, Wednesday, right? Like I'll just take this one day while they try
[2090.63s -> 2096.02s]  to fix it. So that plan is to come back on Tuesday, Wednesday, and probably Tuesday,
[2096.02s -> 2104.36s]  Wednesday, Thursday, I would assume. But I've been, I was told explicitly that they like,
[2105.08s -> 2108.52s]  they were really going to get like to work on. And I think they know what the problem is,
[2109.80s -> 2116.14s]  but let's use the finite amount of time that we still have and watch another video.
[2116.14s -> 2133.98s]  So let's put this on the screen. Hello. I'm John. Hello. Hello, John. Uh, I actually need to
[2134.62s -> 2151.69s]  go like this. I got like an ad. Hold on. Let me let the ad play out first. This is a
[2151.69s -> 2163.86s]  nine minute video. I didn't even realize that. Okay. This should be it. Hey, look at that.
[2163.86s -> 2176.26s]  Is that in the right spot? I think it is. All right. Hi, grab that auto five chin cam
[2176.26s -> 2190.63s]  incoming. It's also been a very long time since I've seen this one too. Let's go ahead
[2190.63s -> 2195.27s]  and type in grand theft auto into the app store search bar. Don't do this if you have never done
[2195.27s -> 2200.63s]  it before. GTA type GTA legit, right? Looks pretty San Andreas. You got vice city.
[2201.19s -> 2210.55s]  And you got all this. Let's what is all this? Grab the auto five type in GTA into the app
[2210.55s -> 2217.64s]  store and accidentally download me grand auto gets good and a thumb stick is right on an ad.
[2218.36s -> 2223.74s]  So we're off to a great start here. Do I have a mission to do?
[2225.29s -> 2231.30s]  Or is this just pop in the game? This this engine, whatever it is, can't even load
[2231.30s -> 2235.58s]  15 feet in front of me. I'm not even sure there's anything I can do here.
[2235.58s -> 2237.82s]  Besides just drive around in the city and just walk around.
[2245.58s -> 2257.11s]  Doesn't like Apple have to approve. Let's get out and walk. Does this actually have a radio
[2257.11s -> 2265.80s]  like GTA as well? I want that bike. Give me that bike. Yes. Thank you. Thank you
[2265.80s -> 2271.00s]  for getting off of your bike and dying. No, he doesn't. He didn't. He kicks my ass, doesn't he?
[2271.00s -> 2275.88s]  Oh my god. I have to unlock. Everything has to be unlocked. Money and diamonds and shit.
[2275.88s -> 2280.94s]  Let's get back in my burger car. One of the only cars I can fucking drive.
[2281.58s -> 2290.15s]  Hold on. 15 diamonds. There it is. The best one. They take a very long time to load.
[2293.13s -> 2299.43s]  This one has graphics. This music is so annoying. I've memorized this whole song.
[2299.43s -> 2307.78s]  Is anyone driving this car? No, there's not. Nobody's driving the car. How do I shut this music off?
[2318.39s -> 2327.64s]  Can't get over this music. Oh, this is like the Fred Flintstone one.
[2332.44s -> 2337.24s]  I probably got so many viruses. Camera. I probably got put on so many lists.
[2338.04s -> 2352.98s]  Why is it just singing to me? Is that a police car or is that a bird like a chickeny?
[2356.87s -> 2362.10s]  Cops found you. Get rid of them. Sounds like Kirby.
[2364.15s -> 2368.54s]  Holy shit. What am I supposed to do? How do you beat that?
[2368.54s -> 2373.93s]  See, the greatest part about this is these two guys that-
[2373.93s -> 2375.77s]  Riding a star. That's right. Don't care at all.
[2376.57s -> 2379.00s]  This is pretty normal to them, apparently.
[2384.02s -> 2388.52s]  Just a normal day in Shitsville. Two guys shooting at each other through a bunch of
[2388.52s -> 2395.78s]  fucking bricks. Oh my god. Why can't you make a full game like this?
[2395.78s -> 2403.38s]  What was in those guns? You can't be in that car.
[2405.64s -> 2411.59s]  Those were Chad's next car game.
[2414.10s -> 2417.46s]  Well, we know this guy really likes this song. That's good to know.
[2417.46s -> 2423.38s]  At least he's got a favorite song. This one's real bare bones.
[2423.38s -> 2425.54s]  One. There was no loading screen.
[2425.54s -> 2427.22s]  There was no menu. It's just one.
[2431.16s -> 2433.72s]  I wish I could explain how hard this was to move.
[2435.14s -> 2436.66s]  Mapping in the corner was so bad.
[2440.86s -> 2442.38s]  Holy shit. That's a lot of money.
[2443.72s -> 2446.12s]  That guy was holding a bank vault worth of money.
[2446.68s -> 2449.45s]  Go get it. 20 bucks.
[2451.37s -> 2454.79s]  That was a stack. Pretend to play it?
[2456.70s -> 2458.54s]  Psycho. I can follow that guy.
[2460.33s -> 2462.97s]  Get out of the window. Just rip him out of the windshield.
[2464.38s -> 2467.42s]  What is going on with- That guy just turned into a bunch of luggage.
[2469.62s -> 2470.82s]  Mack truck. This guy's gonna-
[2472.66s -> 2475.98s]  Oh. Pull him over.
[2492.22s -> 2499.32s]  Time paradox. Same game, same engine, same music.
[2499.32s -> 2502.76s]  The only difference is this time they decided to make you a robot Spider-Man.
[2503.56s -> 2508.63s]  Forgot the script. I guess this one's a slot machine.
[2512.20s -> 2520.49s]  I'm gonna give it 15 seconds before I get run over.
[2522.84s -> 2526.54s]  Somebody behind me? Somebody's just throwing punches at me.
[2526.54s -> 2530.23s]  Get out of here. Are you serious?
[2530.79s -> 2535.48s]  Is he still behind me? He died.
[2536.04s -> 2540.46s]  This is another goal-less game.
[2541.56s -> 2544.68s]  This honestly was one of the top five funniest things ever.
[2545.40s -> 2549.78s]  I literally turned into a cackling witch at the end of this video.
[2550.82s -> 2555.00s]  This went on for so long. All right, hold on. I gotta pause this.
[2555.00s -> 2560.52s]  You know how you've asked before the differences between streaming and YouTube, right?
[2561.48s -> 2564.04s]  Well, the differences between something like this.
[2564.04s -> 2566.92s]  If I streamed this, if I streamed this game and streamed doing this like
[2566.92s -> 2568.20s]  ran the thought oh kind of bit.
[2570.47s -> 2572.15s]  This went on for a very long time.
[2572.15s -> 2575.99s]  Went on for fucking like this would have- this never was going to stop.
[2576.63s -> 2581.83s]  We could have sat here on stream and watched that for like 30 straight minutes.
[2584.47s -> 2587.75s]  And the differences I guess were because I didn't- you don't-
[2587.75s -> 2591.75s]  I didn't even want a video to be like a 20-40 minute long video.
[2591.75s -> 2592.47s]  I cut it down.
[2594.62s -> 2599.98s]  We would have been able to see this live happen in complete and total present reality.
[2601.16s -> 2606.20s]  And we could have- I could have gotten up and I would have just left it on the fucking stream.
[2606.84s -> 2611.22s]  I would have left it there for an hour.
[2611.22s -> 2613.62s]  So that would have been the difference is we would be able to sit there the
[2613.62s -> 2615.38s]  whole time and let it just play out forever.
[2617.74s -> 2620.62s]  But nevertheless, it was still fucking hysterical.
[2620.62s -> 2623.02s]  Ruby, you fucking idiots.
[2623.02s -> 2626.22s]  Where are all these people coming from? Why are they fighting?
[2626.22s -> 2627.02s]  Oh my god.
[2628.94s -> 2630.70s]  This shit was so fucking funny.
[2630.70s -> 2632.06s]  This guy was in slow motion.
[2632.06s -> 2636.01s]  Two people were like, why?
[2636.73s -> 2639.61s]  This dude is gonna stop fighting them?
[2640.94s -> 2642.54s]  Why would you start fighting this guy?
[2646.15s -> 2646.71s]  I don't know.
[2646.71s -> 2647.59s]  I don't understand.
[2648.31s -> 2652.52s]  Is there a reason why these people are all doing this?
[2653.08s -> 2657.34s]  Consider what?
[2657.34s -> 2659.98s]  It's a conga line of people punching each other in the back.
[2661.02s -> 2668.18s]  And then flying away.
[2668.18s -> 2674.71s]  Oh, this went on for so long.
[2674.71s -> 2675.67s]  Just wait till you see.
[2675.67s -> 2676.79s]  Like if you haven't seen this.
[2677.51s -> 2680.49s]  Oh, I'm gonna need a minute after this one.
[2682.79s -> 2689.77s]  I was dying.
[2690.86s -> 2691.66s]  I was fucking crying.
[2695.34s -> 2696.86s]  It's never gonna stop.
[2696.86s -> 2698.62s]  This is never gonna stop.
[2704.49s -> 2705.13s]  Listen to that.
[2705.13s -> 2705.85s]  I'm like dying.
[2705.85s -> 2706.57s]  I'm gonna die.
[2707.53s -> 2708.81s]  I'm seriously gonna die.
[2709.69s -> 2711.05s]  I'm gonna live through this one.
[2724.04s -> 2726.28s]  This is the best thing I've ever seen in any game.
[2727.80s -> 2729.24s]  Just never ending spawn.
[2736.02s -> 2736.74s]  Just flies.
[2736.74s -> 2737.78s]  I don't ever want this to end.
[2738.58s -> 2740.02s]  I don't want to hit pause.
[2740.02s -> 2741.22s]  I don't want to hit replay.
[2741.22s -> 2742.18s]  I don't want to stop it.
[2742.58s -> 2743.54s]  But you know what?
[2743.54s -> 2744.10s]  It's...
[2744.10s -> 2744.98s]  I gotta get out of here.
[2744.98s -> 2746.26s]  I have to stop this.
[2746.26s -> 2746.76s]  Wow.
[2747.62s -> 2750.52s]  Is it first ever I gotta get out of here?
[2750.52s -> 2753.08s]  Holy shit.
[2753.08s -> 2754.20s]  That might be first ever.
[2757.61s -> 2758.41s]  Four years ago.
[2760.38s -> 2763.02s]  Because I'm seriously gonna throw up if I stay here any longer.
[2763.74s -> 2764.94s]  As amazing as this is.
[2766.22s -> 2767.42s]  So I'll talk.
[2771.19s -> 2772.07s]  Hell yeah.
[2772.07s -> 2772.87s]  Of rewards.
[2788.55s -> 2789.51s]  30.
[2789.51s -> 2790.63s]  29 actually.
[2790.63s -> 2791.13s]  29.
[2791.83s -> 2793.80s]  I think I was like 28 or 29.
[2793.80s -> 2795.00s]  29 I think.
[2795.00s -> 2796.04s]  29 by the way.
[2796.60s -> 2808.84s]  Now we'll play role playing duck gamers.
[2810.10s -> 2810.98s]  That's an old one too.
[2813.22s -> 2814.10s]  Uh I think I can...
[2814.10s -> 2814.98s]  Can I...
[2814.98s -> 2816.10s]  I think I can just get it through here.
[2816.10s -> 2816.74s]  Can I?
[2816.74s -> 2817.86s]  I'm like interacting, right?
[2818.58s -> 2821.93s]  Or do I have to redo this?
[2822.65s -> 2825.78s]  I should be able to...
[2826.42s -> 2827.46s]  Can I not interact with it?
[2830.07s -> 2831.03s]  Interact.
[2831.03s -> 2833.59s]  That's why.
[2833.59s -> 2834.55s]  Is it because it's full screen?
[2834.55s -> 2835.03s]  Why can I...
[2835.03s -> 2835.35s]  Come on.
[2837.78s -> 2839.88s]  Apparently not.
[2845.70s -> 2846.20s]  No!
[2846.74s -> 2847.64s]  Why are you doing this?
[2851.37s -> 2853.37s]  Well I will try to pull it from here.
[2854.25s -> 2855.85s]  Role playing duck gamers.
[2861.62s -> 2863.38s]  This video was not that long ago either.
[2863.38s -> 2864.34s]  2015.
[2864.34s -> 2865.70s]  2015 was a good year.
[2874.82s -> 2875.94s]  Alright no ad.
[2875.94s -> 2876.42s]  That's good.
[2880.02s -> 2880.74s]  No ad.
[2885.83s -> 2886.33s]  God!
[2886.95s -> 2894.01s]  There wasn't an ad on here!
[2894.01s -> 2894.81s]  There was no ad!
[2897.61s -> 2898.25s]  Alright here we go.
[2899.05s -> 2902.57s]  This is uh Star and I jumped into duck game and after...
[2903.43s -> 2906.79s]  I don't know maybe like 20 minutes of playing it we figured out that
[2907.43s -> 2910.79s]  it was fun just to pretend to talk through the character's voices
[2910.79s -> 2912.71s]  by pressing the button that makes you quack.
[2918.17s -> 2921.77s]  And nothing else mattered at that point.
[2921.77s -> 2922.41s]  Nothing mattered.
[2923.05s -> 2923.53s]  Only that.
[2924.17s -> 2925.10s]  So here we go.
[2925.10s -> 2926.54s]  Role playing duck gamers.
[2927.10s -> 2939.22s]  You dropped your burger on the ground there.
[2942.50s -> 2945.62s]  Hey have you ever seen that movie Super Mario Brothers 2?
[2946.58s -> 2947.98s]  It's pretty cool.
[2948.62s -> 2951.90s]  You see the main character Super Mario he goes like this
[2952.70s -> 2954.46s]  and he gets in and he rages the game.
[2955.10s -> 2955.90s]  That doesn't even hurt.
[2955.90s -> 2956.54s]  That doesn't even hurt.
[2958.22s -> 2959.29s]  Where's the gun?
[2959.85s -> 2960.73s]  Give me that gun.
[2961.45s -> 2962.70s]  That's a lot.
[2962.70s -> 2963.26s]  Give me this gun.
[2963.26s -> 2963.90s]  Give me that gun.
[2964.70s -> 2965.37s]  I win.
[2966.55s -> 2967.67s]  That's like more fun.
[2969.11s -> 2970.33s]  You got me.
[2970.33s -> 2972.97s]  Today is your unlucky day motherfucker.
[2974.52s -> 2975.02s]  Yeah.
[2975.72s -> 2976.22s]  Yeah.
[2976.84s -> 2977.64s]  Oh yeah.
[2977.64s -> 2978.36s]  Gotcha.
[2978.36s -> 2979.16s]  Gotcha motherfucker.
[2981.50s -> 2984.14s]  I don't think that's gonna stop being funny.
[2985.42s -> 2985.92s]  What's wrong?
[2986.62s -> 2987.34s]  Having some trouble?
[2987.90s -> 2989.32s]  Come on now.
[2989.32s -> 2989.88s]  What do you got?
[2989.88s -> 2990.44s]  You got a pistol.
[2990.44s -> 2990.92s]  I got a pistol.
[2990.92s -> 2991.72s]  I'm gonna shoot you with this pistol.
[2993.08s -> 2993.32s]  Duck.
[2993.90s -> 2994.40s]  Jump.
[2995.85s -> 2996.81s]  Get ready.
[2996.81s -> 2997.93s]  I mean get ready.
[3000.54s -> 3002.06s]  It's actually kind of hard.
[3002.06s -> 3006.38s]  It's hard to like hit B and make the mouth open and play the game at the same time.
[3006.38s -> 3007.10s]  It's very hard.
[3007.10s -> 3008.54s]  Watch out I got a shotgun.
[3008.54s -> 3009.26s]  I got one too.
[3009.98s -> 3010.94s]  I'm gonna blast you.
[3010.94s -> 3011.66s]  You're gonna blast me?
[3012.30s -> 3013.10s]  I'm gonna throw it.
[3013.10s -> 3014.86s]  You think you're gonna blast me?
[3014.86s -> 3016.46s]  Well I'm not gonna now I don't have a shotgun.
[3016.46s -> 3017.10s]  Come chase me.
[3018.36s -> 3018.86s]  What?
[3021.00s -> 3022.36s]  Come chase me?
[3022.36s -> 3022.92s]  I don't know.
[3023.64s -> 3024.52s]  Come chase me.
[3024.52s -> 3025.88s]  You're the one with the gun.
[3025.88s -> 3026.92s]  This is so fun.
[3026.92s -> 3027.80s]  What a fun thing.
[3027.80s -> 3030.52s]  We're gonna do it just like they used to do in the old times.
[3031.16s -> 3032.44s]  Back to back ten paces.
[3034.49s -> 3035.93s]  Turn around.
[3035.93s -> 3037.69s]  Okay in ten paces.
[3038.49s -> 3038.99s]  Go.
[3039.29s -> 3043.77s]  One two three four five six seven eight nine ten.
[3046.57s -> 3047.07s]  Die.
[3049.37s -> 3050.89s]  My die was like eight syllables.
[3055.37s -> 3057.85s]  Look look this is the gun from Earthworm Jim.
[3057.85s -> 3058.35s]  Cool huh?

[3067.56s -> 3068.44s]  He's my friend.
[3068.44s -> 3069.48s]  But is he really though?
[3069.48s -> 3070.12s]  I don't know.
[3070.12s -> 3070.76s]  Could he be?
[3070.76s -> 3071.80s]  I have no idea.
[3071.80s -> 3072.36s]  Friends.
[3072.36s -> 3073.16s]  I love friends.

[3073.80s -> 3075.32s]  Fuck this whole thing.
[3075.32s -> 3076.52s]  This whole thing sucks.
[3076.52s -> 3077.80s]  Fuck this video.
[3077.80s -> 3080.76s]  When I sit up here and stare at this red beam.
[3081.72s -> 3082.76s]  I think about my life.
[3083.82s -> 3084.94s]  And where I've been.
[3084.94s -> 3085.66s]  And where I'll go.
[3087.32s -> 3087.82s]  And what?
[3088.60s -> 3089.16s]  Aliens.
[3090.17s -> 3091.93s]  Are we the aliens to aliens?
[3098.87s -> 3100.31s]  We just want to watch the world burn.
[3101.35s -> 3102.39s]  That's a Batman quote.
[3103.19s -> 3105.19s]  Some people just want to watch the world burn.
[3105.19s -> 3106.55s]  I wonder how long this recording has been.
[3108.70s -> 3109.50s]  Hello there.
[3109.50s -> 3110.70s]  Welcome to the shoe shop.

[3121.93s -> 3122.49s]  Dead dead?
[3123.53s -> 3124.33s]  Doesn't look like it.
[3124.33s -> 3125.13s]  Almost.
[3125.13s -> 3125.37s]  Close.
[3125.37s -> 3126.25s]  That was really close.

[3203.28s -> 3205.45s]  Yes my old nemesis.

[3206.97s -> 3208.49s]  Those of you that know who he is.
[3209.13s -> 3212.09s]  He's a dastardly villain and he must be destroyed.
[3212.89s -> 3214.83s]  You have to come down here.
[3214.83s -> 3215.31s]  Yeah I know.
[3216.20s -> 3217.08s]  I will eventually.
[3217.08s -> 3218.44s]  I'm doing my monologue.
[3218.44s -> 3220.76s]  It's incredibly important to the story arc of my character.
[3221.80s -> 3226.01s]  I don't I seriously don't know how.
[3226.01s -> 3226.97s]  Go get him Glenn.
[3226.97s -> 3228.49s]  I can even I could tolerate as a person.
[3229.69s -> 3232.09s]  That's the gun from uh that's the moon gun.
[3232.09s -> 3233.37s]  I'm gonna catch it in my mouth.
[3233.37s -> 3233.85s]  Hold on.
[3233.85s -> 3234.97s]  No no don't die don't die.
[3242.83s -> 3243.47s]  There he is.
[3243.47s -> 3245.63s]  Ladies and gentlemen that's the guy that had my character.
[3245.63s -> 3246.83s]  I have to go to kill that guy.
[3246.83s -> 3248.11s]  It's part of my character story life.
[3253.47s -> 3257.55s]  All right you got all right do you know you know when somebody's having too way too much fun.
[3260.19s -> 3263.39s]  I'm having like so much like too much fun.
[3272.17s -> 3274.33s]  I don't I seriously don't know how many more of these I can.
[3274.33s -> 3275.85s]  I can't tolerate as a person.
[3277.05s -> 3279.45s]  That's the gun from uh that's the moon gun.
[3279.45s -> 3280.73s]  I'm gonna catch it in my mouth.
[3280.73s -> 3281.29s]  Hold on.
[3281.29s -> 3282.33s]  No no don't die don't die.
[3290.24s -> 3290.80s]  There he is.
[3290.80s -> 3292.96s]  Ladies and gentlemen that's the guy that had my character.
[3292.96s -> 3294.16s]  I have to go to kill that guy.
[3294.16s -> 3295.44s]  It's part of my character story life.
[3302.30s -> 3303.34s]  Catch it in my mouth.
[3304.38s -> 3309.02s]  All right so your first day on the job here at Edwards construction.
[3309.74s -> 3310.70s]  You got to be careful.
[3312.83s -> 3313.79s]  Told you to be careful.
[3316.28s -> 3320.84s]  And that's when she told me to go to school.
[3321.64s -> 3323.64s]  She wanted to see me.
[3324.44s -> 3326.76s]  Well you're really fucking this up aren't you.
[3326.76s -> 3328.04s]  This turns into animal.
[3328.68s -> 3332.14s]  Are we the aliens to that planet?
[3333.90s -> 3335.50s]  Makes sense in my opinion.
[3336.44s -> 3340.36s]  Although a more existential way to look at it is probably like this.
[3349.37s -> 3350.57s]  Can you believe Carol?
[3350.57s -> 3351.53s]  Carol in accounting.
[3352.09s -> 3354.57s]  Man she really gave me the ride.
[3354.57s -> 3355.85s]  I have to get back to work.
[3357.60s -> 3358.24s]  Yeah you do.
[3359.20s -> 3360.80s]  I don't know why you've been doing that.
[3360.80s -> 3362.08s]  Seems kind of expensive.
[3362.72s -> 3369.13s]  All right I'm ready.
[3369.85s -> 3371.93s]  Okay I'm gonna catch it in my mouth.
[3371.93s -> 3373.05s]  Didn't we just do this?
[3374.01s -> 3386.19s]  Okay I just want to say congratulations on being number one.
[3386.19s -> 3387.71s]  You don't talk to me.
[3387.71s -> 3388.75s]  You deserve that trophy.
[3388.75s -> 3390.11s]  Your second place I win.
[3392.80s -> 3394.00s]  You don't talk to me.
[3394.88s -> 3396.80s]  Your second place I win.
[3404.54s -> 3406.22s]  This video is so much fun to make.
[3407.36s -> 3408.48s]  Oh speaking of Star.
[3409.74s -> 3413.66s]  You'll be pleased to know that we're probably going to play something fairly soon.
[3420.33s -> 3422.41s]  I actually just talked to him like a few days ago.
[3423.96s -> 3426.62s]  So Jerma and Star.
[3427.18s -> 3429.10s]  Everybody wants to see this fucking happen.
[3429.74s -> 3430.86s]  I'm not playing that video though.
[3430.86s -> 3433.26s]  That's an embarrassing, that's an embarrassment to me video.
[3435.44s -> 3438.32s]  Yeah we were talking about just playing some ram stuff so this should be fun.
[3443.85s -> 3444.33s]  Do it!
[3444.33s -> 3444.73s]  Do it!
[3444.73s -> 3445.21s]  Do it!
[3445.21s -> 3446.01s]  No I can't do it.
[3446.01s -> 3447.45s]  We've got them dropping too many frames.
[3447.45s -> 3448.33s]  You wouldn't even be able to see it.
[3450.30s -> 3453.40s]  Tactical intervention.
[3453.40s -> 3454.36s]  That's another one that was...
[3455.47s -> 3456.03s]  I want to like...
[3462.36s -> 3464.76s]  Yeah we got to watch the tactical intervention video.
[3464.76s -> 3465.96s]  That video is fucked.
[3465.96s -> 3467.24s]  That game is fucked.
[3469.72s -> 3471.16s]  That game is insane.
[3481.95s -> 3483.63s]  If you type tactical intervention.
[3485.76s -> 3490.16s]  It's Star and my videos of what happens here.
[3490.88s -> 3502.25s]  All right let's load it up.
[3502.25s -> 3507.29s]  Jerma is mad.
[3507.29s -> 3507.85s]  Part three.
[3508.65s -> 3513.77s]  Now let me open this up.
[3513.77s -> 3518.44s]  Which this should...
[3518.44s -> 3519.40s]  What's this on here?
[3520.20s -> 3523.66s]  How many of those did he make?
[3524.38s -> 3525.92s]  He made a lot of those didn't he?
[3530.22s -> 3531.34s]  I got it.
[3531.34s -> 3532.54s]  I caught it before it could happen.
[3535.34s -> 3542.54s]  We I saved you from watching the ghost recon breakpoint explode inside of your ears ad video.
[3545.15s -> 3547.47s]  Why am I getting two ads back to back?
[3547.47s -> 3549.53s]  What is up with this?
[3550.17s -> 3550.73s]  Since when?
[3552.89s -> 3555.20s]  All right here we go.
[3565.80s -> 3567.16s]  Three two one play it.
[3576.70s -> 3579.50s]  It's just it's just showing us the scenery.
[3579.50s -> 3580.38s]  Yeah why isn't it just...
[3581.02s -> 3582.22s]  Okay here we go.
[3582.22s -> 3583.42s]  Oh god this is so loud.
[3583.42s -> 3584.38s]  Why is it so loud?
[3584.38s -> 3585.18s]  Every game is loud.
[3585.98s -> 3588.78s]  And now you're you're wicked loud again.
[3588.78s -> 3589.66s]  This siren.
[3590.38s -> 3591.58s]  You are so loud.
[3593.53s -> 3594.49s]  I guess I'm ready.
[3595.29s -> 3599.39s]  This siren does not stop for the entire video.
[3601.39s -> 3603.63s]  This is the loudest game ever.
[3603.63s -> 3604.91s]  Oh my god I'm driving.
[3604.91s -> 3606.03s]  Are you driving?
[3606.03s -> 3606.51s]  I'm in the car.
[3606.51s -> 3607.15s]  I'm in your car.
[3607.87s -> 3608.91s]  Are you behind me?
[3608.91s -> 3609.71s]  Yeah I'm behind you.
[3615.58s -> 3617.42s]  That shit's fucking so stupid.
[3617.42s -> 3619.34s]  This is a secret highway route.
[3619.34s -> 3623.50s]  But everything is so loud and you are so loud.
[3623.50s -> 3625.74s]  You are so loud right now.
[3626.46s -> 3627.34s]  I'm sorry.
[3627.34s -> 3629.26s]  Your microphone is so fucked.
[3630.30s -> 3631.26s]  Hey look at this car.
[3633.58s -> 3634.54s]  I can't control this.
[3636.30s -> 3637.34s]  What is the objective?
[3643.16s -> 3644.20s]  I'm passing out dude.
[3645.32s -> 3646.68s]  The world is closing in.
[3647.16s -> 3649.56s]  The world is closing in.
[3655.92s -> 3658.48s]  It started to see black like I was fainting.
[3664.59s -> 3665.31s]  Do we get out?
[3674.32s -> 3675.44s]  And we won the game.
[3679.72s -> 3683.24s]  All right so something really important because the thing with making a video
[3684.20s -> 3689.34s]  after the fact there was three tracks right?
[3689.34s -> 3692.46s]  There was the game audio, there was my audio, and there was star's audio.
[3693.34s -> 3698.92s]  So every time you'd make a video you'd have three different audio timelines
[3698.92s -> 3700.20s]  in your editing software.
[3700.92s -> 3703.96s]  So to be able to have this video actually play audibly
[3706.36s -> 3708.28s]  in any video, it didn't matter which one it was,
[3708.28s -> 3711.00s]  you played with the audio levels to make it so the tracks
[3711.00s -> 3713.00s]  weren't too overbearing or too horrible.
[3713.64s -> 3717.00s]  This video, what you're hearing does not do justice to how loud this actually was.
[3717.00s -> 3722.52s]  This had to be dropped like 75% to not be completely blowing out
[3722.52s -> 3724.60s]  every single person's eardrums that watched the video.
[3726.44s -> 3728.44s]  So like how loud this was.
[3728.44s -> 3732.12s]  He is, and not just the game, for some reason his microphone was like
[3732.12s -> 3734.20s]  I'm gonna peek and break and be loud as fuck too.
[3739.45s -> 3743.13s]  It was just, listen to why when he says we win you can hear his mic crying.
[3747.13s -> 3747.93s]  Do we get out?
[3748.65s -> 3751.29s]  No, no, don't get out, don't get out.
[3751.29s -> 3752.09s]  I can't, I can't get out.
[3752.73s -> 3753.77s]  No, I'm driving.
[3755.77s -> 3756.65s]  Do you hear that?
[3758.68s -> 3759.64s]  It's so bad.
[3763.56s -> 3764.84s]  Peek your mic, peek your mic.
[3764.84s -> 3768.60s]  Yeah, we're off, we're off, we're on, we're off, we're on.
[3770.24s -> 3771.36s]  Highway mode was so good.
[3773.85s -> 3777.77s]  Some of these first experiences in these games,
[3779.23s -> 3780.43s]  I'll never forget that.
[3780.43s -> 3782.19s]  I will never forget how funny that was.
[3782.83s -> 3785.93s]  We didn't even know what we were playing.
[3785.93s -> 3787.05s]  It was just like, let's play this.
[3787.05s -> 3788.17s]  This sounds like fun.
[3788.17s -> 3790.73s]  It's by the guy that made Counter-Strike, right?
[3790.73s -> 3793.05s]  That's what you knew when you went into that.
[3793.05s -> 3793.77s]  That's all you knew.
[3795.64s -> 3798.60s]  So guy that made Counter-Strike made this game.
[3798.60s -> 3801.00s]  Oh, let's play it together and maybe we'll record it.
[3801.00s -> 3801.96s]  And this is what happens.
[3803.92s -> 3805.84s]  It's just, it's wonderful.
[3807.68s -> 3809.44s]  How's the, I actually, I haven't played it in a long time.
[3809.44s -> 3810.96s]  Didn't they do, they redid it.
[3810.96s -> 3812.40s]  Didn't they like remake a bunch of it?
[3815.47s -> 3817.23s]  But that's the thing people say like,
[3817.23s -> 3819.15s]  oh, video games and playing with like people
[3819.15s -> 3820.59s]  and your friends and getting them calls.
[3821.48s -> 3823.00s]  Like that's the kind of shit
[3823.00s -> 3824.60s]  that you want to take away from that.
[3824.60s -> 3825.16s]  You know what I mean?
[3827.21s -> 3828.65s]  Even when I'm like 80 years old,
[3828.65s -> 3830.25s]  I will always remember that first,
[3830.25s -> 3832.73s]  like 25 minutes in Tactical Intervention.
[3833.53s -> 3835.05s]  I just will, I know I will
[3835.05s -> 3838.01s]  because it was fucking so unbelievable.
[3838.01s -> 3838.97s]  It was so ridiculous.
[3839.61s -> 3844.09s]  Is it, did it shut down?
[3844.09s -> 3845.77s]  Yeah, sorry, the server shut down.
[3845.77s -> 3846.25s]  That's too bad.
[3849.08s -> 3851.88s]  But let's continue through the video.
[3852.52s -> 3854.84s]  Here we go.
[3858.40s -> 3869.44s]  Oh, what the fuck is this, Jay?
[3870.96s -> 3872.40s]  Hold on, I'm not ready.
[3872.40s -> 3873.04s]  I'm not ready.
[3873.04s -> 3874.56s]  I need to fix this audio.
[3879.42s -> 3880.94s]  Deep fried star.
[3884.78s -> 3886.14s]  Audio, jeez.
[3886.14s -> 3887.02s]  Bring the master ball.
[3887.02s -> 3888.14s]  You're the driver.
[3888.14s -> 3889.10s]  I'm wait, I'm driving.
[3894.43s -> 3896.19s]  Watch out, there's guys behind us.
[3896.19s -> 3897.23s]  How do I drive?
[3897.23s -> 3900.11s]  This car drives like a piece of shit.
[3900.11s -> 3901.55s]  Yeah, it was pretty bad.
[3901.55s -> 3902.99s]  Why do you get arrows pointing?
[3903.63s -> 3904.99s]  Yeah, why do I get the GPS?
[3904.99s -> 3905.87s]  You didn't get the GPS.
[3905.87s -> 3906.51s]  I'm getting out.
[3910.03s -> 3911.95s]  Somebody was still in the back, I remember.
[3912.83s -> 3915.07s]  Like the VIP is in the back seat.
[3916.35s -> 3925.98s]  The guy in the back seat wasn't even in the call.
[3925.98s -> 3930.14s]  He's just like, what am I supposed to do?
[3930.22s -> 3931.26s]  The game just released.
[3931.26s -> 3932.54s]  I don't know what the fuck to do.
[3934.88s -> 3940.00s]  I'm just watching some guy drive his car.
[3940.00s -> 3942.48s]  He was sitting in the back seat, just sitting there.
[3949.00s -> 3950.52s]  You are a fucking asshole.
[3951.40s -> 3952.76s]  This is the best thing ever.
[3953.56s -> 3953.96s]  It really is.
[3953.96s -> 3954.68s]  How's this guy doing?
[3954.68s -> 3955.40s]  He looks like he's-
[3955.40s -> 3955.88s]  Oh, boo!
[3956.52s -> 3958.20s]  He's just like looking at me, just beeping.
[3968.91s -> 3979.15s]  He blew out of the car and then back flipped.
[3994.59s -> 3995.23s]  He's alive.
[3995.23s -> 3996.81s]  The VIP is alive.
[3997.53s -> 3998.83s]  That makes no sense.
[4002.84s -> 4008.52s]  He's sitting on the dash.
[4011.48s -> 4015.16s]  This game, I can't take it anymore.
[4015.16s -> 4016.12s]  I got to get out of here.
[4016.12s -> 4016.76s]  Wait, what the hell?
[4017.72s -> 4019.16s]  That's the first, you got to get out of here.
[4022.73s -> 4026.57s]  People just gunned him down, surrounded him, and just started firing.
[4026.57s -> 4028.01s]  All right, I'm driving.
[4028.01s -> 4028.89s]  I'm going fast.
[4028.89s -> 4030.01s]  I got the need for speed.
[4032.49s -> 4033.21s]  Get out of the car.
[4034.17s -> 4034.65s]  Get out of the car.
[4034.65s -> 4037.21s]  There's two of the same guy holding their feet on the car.
[4043.61s -> 4045.85s]  There's two of the same guy with the feet on the dash.
[4055.93s -> 4057.45s]  I seriously am passing out.
[4057.45s -> 4059.29s]  You see the spoiler on the back of that car?
[4059.29s -> 4060.97s]  No, I'm too busy blacking out.
[4061.93s -> 4063.69s]  It just threw us into this game.
[4064.89s -> 4069.53s]  I remember, I remember I had to like go to bed after this.
[4070.17s -> 4072.80s]  This is one of those scenarios we played.
[4072.80s -> 4073.76s]  I don't know, this is like five minutes.
[4073.76s -> 4075.76s]  We probably played for like a couple hours, two, three hours maybe.
[4076.56s -> 4077.60s]  Maybe a little bit more.
[4078.32s -> 4082.33s]  And I distinctly remember like being hungover.
[4082.33s -> 4083.29s]  That happens to me.
[4083.29s -> 4083.69s]  It does.
[4086.60s -> 4087.88s]  I don't make that shit up.
[4087.88s -> 4092.94s]  Like when I laugh to a point where I fucking like start crying and shit.
[4093.10s -> 4095.34s]  Like I like start to fade out.
[4095.34s -> 4101.39s]  I get like streaming video hungover.
[4101.39s -> 4102.99s]  I get like comedy hungover.
[4104.00s -> 4104.64s]  I really do.
[4109.12s -> 4110.48s]  Seriously, we were at the ready screen.
[4110.48s -> 4111.92s]  It got wicked loud.
[4112.96s -> 4116.43s]  That was just too much like too much stimulation.
[4116.43s -> 4119.31s]  The last time, the last time I faded out for real.
[4120.11s -> 4123.23s]  Actually truly faded out was during the Sims 4 mod night.
[4124.24s -> 4125.44s]  During the dog peeing shit.
[4125.44s -> 4127.20s]  Like the guy on drugs with his dogs.
[4128.08s -> 4135.34s]  That is the last time that I actually like got fucking video game hungover.
[4135.34s -> 4139.18s]  I just, the dog rolling around in its own piss and the guy on drugs
[4139.18s -> 4140.78s]  walking and walking the dog in his own house.
[4142.22s -> 4143.26s]  Like I was blacking out.
[4146.97s -> 4148.81s]  I came pretty close a few more times.
[4148.81s -> 4149.61s]  Like recently.
[4151.45s -> 4152.73s]  But then like that, I don't know.
[4152.73s -> 4154.49s]  Then like later on that night you just kind of,
[4155.29s -> 4158.17s]  you just like fucking god it feels like you just got run over by a car.
[4159.90s -> 4160.94s]  The farts and screams.
[4160.94s -> 4162.14s]  I didn't black out during that.
[4162.14s -> 4164.30s]  I started like welling up a little bit here.
[4165.20s -> 4171.37s]  But those mods, the first handful of those mods.
[4172.33s -> 4178.81s]  Oh, I'm about, I actually had eject, but I wasn't blacking out there.
[4179.77s -> 4183.79s]  I have a distinct memory of taking my headphones out.
[4183.79s -> 4185.07s]  So I think I said it a few times.
[4185.07s -> 4186.27s]  Like I have to leave the room.
[4186.27s -> 4186.99s]  I turned around.
[4186.99s -> 4191.39s]  I like got out of the fucking chair and I like walked over here to just get away from the desk.
[4196.91s -> 4197.79s]  I love this shit.
[4197.79s -> 4203.18s]  Like it, it's got, it has to be constant laughter for a little while.
[4204.06s -> 4210.86s]  If you expel like enough laughter and you laugh enough and then you, you like get back.
[4210.86s -> 4215.02s]  But if something else happens that you see when you're in the middle of desperately trying
[4215.02s -> 4219.02s]  to come back, that's where you get like comedy injured.
[4220.00s -> 4222.64s]  You see something or something plays out in your head over and over again.
[4222.64s -> 4231.00s]  We, you think about it over and over again in your head of why you think it's so funny.
[4231.00s -> 4234.68s]  But it's, this is just reminds me and even from streams too.
[4234.68s -> 4237.96s]  This is just reminds me just how much fun some of this shit just truly is.
[4240.09s -> 4242.65s]  It, I fucking, I love this shit.
[4244.78s -> 4246.06s]  It's fucking so much fun.
[4249.05s -> 4250.41s]  Hyperventil laughing.
[4250.41s -> 4253.85s]  Yeah, the laugh just keeps punching you.
[4254.49s -> 4255.37s]  How does this one end?
[4255.37s -> 4256.01s]  Of the brain.
[4257.52s -> 4258.72s]  My old screen.
[4260.32s -> 4262.32s]  Subscribe for more like if you did.
[4264.40s -> 4264.96s]  If you did.
[4264.96s -> 4268.08s]  I only like if you did, if you liked.
[4269.61s -> 4271.13s]  If you didn't like it, then you didn't have to like it.
[4271.13s -> 4272.17s]  But I like if you did.
[4272.81s -> 4278.78s]  I hated that one.
[4278.78s -> 4280.46s]  Well, I hope you didn't like the video then.
[4291.77s -> 4293.29s]  Have I watched all stars videos?
[4293.29s -> 4294.97s]  Oh, I've seen every single one of his videos.
[4301.00s -> 4301.24s]  All right.
[4301.24s -> 4301.72s]  What's next?
[4302.36s -> 4307.28s]  German, no, no German rumble.
[4307.28s -> 4311.42s]  I feel like we've German rumble has been seen plenty of times.
[4312.22s -> 4314.78s]  I want to kind of revisit some of the old ones that like I don't,
[4314.78s -> 4315.82s]  I haven't watched in a while.
[4323.58s -> 4324.46s]  Raven's cry.
[4324.46s -> 4326.94s]  Oh man, that's an old one.
[4329.82s -> 4330.62s]  Raven's cries.
[4331.26s -> 4332.41s]  Crazy.
[4332.41s -> 4334.41s]  Which one though, I did two videos on that game.
[4338.64s -> 4341.52s]  I made two Raven's cry videos because they've remade it.
[4351.95s -> 4355.48s]  Wait, did I Raven's did?
[4356.20s -> 4358.36s]  Did I make two videos on Raven's cry?
[4358.36s -> 4359.48s]  Yeah, I say, yes, yes, yes, I did.
[4359.48s -> 4360.68s]  Okay, I tell you, I did.
[4360.68s -> 4368.73s]  This is Raven's cry is a finished game.
[4371.29s -> 4371.93s]  Be brave.
[4382.06s -> 4383.10s]  Oh, internet.
[4383.10s -> 4383.66s]  How are we doing?
[4386.99s -> 4390.46s]  Ooh, not very good, it seems.
[4390.46s -> 4401.90s]  All right, let's add this.
[4404.68s -> 4406.22s]  Doink, doink.
[4412.67s -> 4413.71s]  Raven's cry.
[4419.72s -> 4423.68s]  What?
[4423.68s -> 4425.12s]  Why is this not playing here?
[4425.12s -> 4432.01s]  Oh, here we go.
[4432.01s -> 4435.76s]  That was weird.
[4435.76s -> 4437.60s]  All right, let's watch Raven's cry.
[4447.58s -> 4450.38s]  Three, two, one, action.
[4450.38s -> 4459.76s]  This guy looks like he's waiting for a bus.
[4463.39s -> 4464.19s]  Get out of my way.
[4464.19s -> 4466.44s]  Get out of my way.
[4466.44s -> 4467.96s]  There's no need to be rude.
[4467.96s -> 4469.08s]  I was just.
[4469.08s -> 4470.28s]  It's the same person talking.
[4471.61s -> 4472.49s]  I didn't even do that.
[4472.49s -> 4473.37s]  I didn't even do that.
[4473.37s -> 4473.85s]  Why?
[4473.85s -> 4476.09s]  Yeah, half the audio wasn't recorded.
[4476.81s -> 4480.19s]  Uh-oh, there's pirates here waiting for me.
[4482.83s -> 4485.23s]  And there's no, none of them.
[4485.23s -> 4485.71s]  None of them.
[4485.71s -> 4487.31s]  You let them have the flag and here you stand.
[4487.31s -> 4488.75s]  Mind telling me how that's possible?
[4489.39s -> 4490.75s]  My name is Christopher Riddle.
[4490.75s -> 4492.11s]  My name is Batman.
[4492.19s -> 4492.83s]  Touch more ass.
[4492.83s -> 4494.03s]  Remember that drunken asshole?
[4494.03s -> 4494.67s]  We all know.
[4494.67s -> 4498.83s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4500.59s -> 4502.62s]  So what's next?
[4504.72s -> 4505.20s]  Turn it up.
[4513.31s -> 4513.63s]  All right.
[4513.63s -> 4518.19s]  This really does sound like it sounds like somebody was just at like a bar
[4518.19s -> 4521.47s]  drinking with their buddies and held a microphone in front of
[4521.47s -> 4523.15s]  some one of their friends was just like, hey, can you
[4526.32s -> 4528.88s]  can you do like a fucking shitty pirate voice for me?
[4532.92s -> 4534.12s]  Of course his asses.
[4535.72s -> 4538.12s]  All right, this swear guy is seriously driving me crazy.
[4541.61s -> 4542.57s]  This is all he does.
[4543.21s -> 4546.97s]  There's a guy on this boat that's just saying a variation of the same insult.
[4550.33s -> 4553.45s]  He's telling us to be brave and at the same sentence he's calling us names.
[4554.01s -> 4554.81s]  Which one is it?
[4558.30s -> 4564.54s]  We're sinking.
[4572.28s -> 4573.08s]  He's sinking.
[4574.46s -> 4576.14s]  Sinking into the sea.
[4576.14s -> 4577.34s]  We don't die today.
[4578.06s -> 4579.26s]  You bitches.
[4582.25s -> 4583.29s]  God damn it, man.
[4583.29s -> 4586.01s]  Well, first I'm going to stand and then I'm going to put them
[4586.01s -> 4588.89s]  and then we're going to put them again and then I'm going to put them again
[4588.89s -> 4591.21s]  and then I'm going to stand and then I'm going to stand.
[4598.04s -> 4602.09s]  Why does he keep telling me to do the fear skill?
[4604.01s -> 4604.89s]  I did not mean to shoot that guy.
[4604.89s -> 4605.69s]  Didn't mean to kill that guy.
[4605.69s -> 4606.33s]  I really didn't.
[4606.33s -> 4607.61s]  I'm trying to do the fear skill.
[4608.57s -> 4609.77s]  Nobody seems to care though.
[4609.77s -> 4610.73s]  Apparently that guy.
[4611.69s -> 4612.89s]  Nobody cares about that guy.
[4612.89s -> 4613.53s]  Everyone's cool.
[4613.53s -> 4614.01s]  We're all right.
[4614.01s -> 4614.41s]  We're good.
[4615.21s -> 4618.78s]  Look, a guy sleeping on the dock.
[4618.78s -> 4619.34s]  What do you know?
[4620.43s -> 4621.47s]  Hey, who's got a gun here?
[4621.47s -> 4622.27s]  You're going to put a gun on me?
[4622.27s -> 4623.07s]  Are you crazy, man?
[4623.07s -> 4624.43s]  Let's see if you can put somebody's eye out.
[4624.43s -> 4624.99s]  I'm tired.
[4624.99s -> 4626.11s]  I'm going back to bed.
[4626.11s -> 4626.75s]  I think I'm good.
[4626.75s -> 4626.99s]  No, wait.
[4626.99s -> 4627.71s]  You've got a gun still.
[4627.71s -> 4628.35s]  Oh my god, dude.
[4628.35s -> 4629.63s]  You're going to kill somebody with that thing.
[4629.63s -> 4630.43s]  I'm sleepy.
[4630.43s -> 4630.83s]  I'm going back.
[4630.83s -> 4631.95s]  I'm not tired anymore.
[4631.95s -> 4632.99s]  You think I'm tired?
[4632.99s -> 4634.03s]  No, I am tired.
[4634.03s -> 4635.87s]  No, I'm going to wake up now because you've got a gun.
[4636.43s -> 4637.07s]  This guy's crazy.
[4637.07s -> 4637.95s]  I'm tired again.
[4637.95s -> 4638.75s]  No, I'm not tired.
[4638.75s -> 4639.47s]  You think I'm tired?
[4639.47s -> 4640.03s]  Fuck you.
[4640.03s -> 4640.83s]  I'm tired again.
[4641.39s -> 4642.03s]  Oh, hey.
[4643.55s -> 4644.51s]  I don't want to fight these guys.
[4646.40s -> 4647.68s]  You quacks.
[4647.68s -> 4648.88s]  That's my favorite one.
[4648.88s -> 4649.44s]  My favorite one.
[4650.32s -> 4650.96s]  Be brave.
[4650.96s -> 4651.84s]  You quacks.
[4652.64s -> 4653.44s]  You quacks.
[4654.46s -> 4655.34s]  That's the best one.
[4656.16s -> 4657.84s]  That is absolutely the funniest one.
[4666.86s -> 4667.58s]  Dingy boat.
[4667.58s -> 4668.22s]  Why quacks?
[4668.22s -> 4669.98s]  These guys are shooting like 300.
[4669.98s -> 4670.94s]  Oh my god.
[4672.14s -> 4672.78s]  Be brave.
[4672.78s -> 4673.26s]  Shit.
[4673.26s -> 4675.26s]  There's no way I'm going to be able to fight these guys.
[4676.30s -> 4677.74s]  I just like 2%.
[4677.74s -> 4679.82s]  I did like not even 1% damage.
[4679.82s -> 4681.34s]  We're like instantly getting killed.
[4682.40s -> 4683.44s]  I can't even turn the wheel.
[4684.40s -> 4686.81s]  It's all your fault.
[4686.81s -> 4688.25s]  You numbskull.
[4688.25s -> 4688.75s]  No.
[4694.65s -> 4695.93s]  Who's saying you need me?
[4698.96s -> 4701.20s]  Why is that the fucking reverse of yeah?
[4702.83s -> 4703.33s]  No.
[4705.61s -> 4706.41s]  No.
[4706.41s -> 4709.72s]  Oh shit, there's a prisoner in here.
[4710.73s -> 4711.61s]  Get me out of here.
[4712.25s -> 4715.34s]  That's not a very secure prison.
[4717.64s -> 4718.36s]  Excuse me.
[4718.36s -> 4719.40s]  Just go the other way.
[4722.20s -> 4723.40s]  I don't even know what that means.
[4723.40s -> 4725.32s]  You just said a nonsense statement.

[4911.02s -> 4913.82s]  No joke dad somebody fucking broke the discord with.
[4920.52s -> 4921.48s]  Serious right now.
[4927.56s -> 4929.88s]  I can't believe that somebody just broke the discord.
[4933.84s -> 4935.60s]  What if it just shuts down forever?
[4935.60s -> 4936.72s]  What if we never get it back?
[4939.42s -> 4940.30s]  Wait a second.
[4940.30s -> 4941.02s]  Don't even tell me.
[4942.22s -> 4943.34s]  Oh yeah people just peed.
[4943.98s -> 4945.66s]  People just pee in bushes.
[4945.66s -> 4947.98s]  No I forgot about this.
[4947.98s -> 4949.98s]  Yeah this is a lady pissing into a bush.
[4949.98s -> 4952.62s]  I completely forgot that people would just pee.
[4952.62s -> 4953.98s]  God they keep tempting me.
[4953.98s -> 4955.34s]  Stop tempting me with this.
[4956.06s -> 4956.62s]  Come on.
[4957.60s -> 4959.36s]  I like people just peed.
[4959.36s -> 4961.28s]  They keep putting them in the perfect spot
[4961.28s -> 4963.20s]  for you to push them off the giant scaffolding.
[4964.08s -> 4968.00s]  Do you have any idea how hard it is to not do that?
[4968.08s -> 4969.04s]  Look again.
[4969.04s -> 4970.72s]  And this guy this guy's pissing.
[4972.81s -> 4973.85s]  No he's not.
[4973.85s -> 4974.73s]  What is this guy doing?
[4974.73s -> 4975.61s]  He's puking right.
[4977.66s -> 4978.78s]  Oh he's throwing up.
[4978.78s -> 4980.38s]  He's throwing up into an invisible ground.
[4981.18s -> 4984.57s]  That was mean.
[4985.29s -> 4986.33s]  That was me I got sick.
[4987.45s -> 4988.09s]  He was ill.
[4988.97s -> 4990.49s]  Wait was that the guy I was supposed to talk to?
[4995.28s -> 4996.24s]  You guys notice something?
[4998.84s -> 5001.48s]  Anything seem a little off to you guys at all?
[5002.20s -> 5002.68s]  Just listen.
[5010.16s -> 5011.12s]  They patched him out of the game.
[5011.84s -> 5015.39s]  The last clip you saw was like two and a half days ago.
[5015.95s -> 5018.99s]  They removed this is all new dialogue on the boat.
[5019.71s -> 5020.99s]  Anytime you go on the boat now it's this.
[5022.59s -> 5023.79s]  What were the patch notes?
[5023.79s -> 5026.99s]  Did they say like oh we removed these scream swears be brave guy.
[5027.71s -> 5031.39s]  We apologize for his uncalled for insults.
[5032.19s -> 5033.15s]  And he has been removed.
[5033.15s -> 5033.79s]  I want him back.
[5034.35s -> 5035.23s]  Where is he?
[5035.23s -> 5037.31s]  He was an integral part of my crew.
[5037.31s -> 5040.59s]  He was he was like the bet they just they patched him up.
[5042.76s -> 5045.40s]  I remember because I was recording over like a few days here.
[5045.40s -> 5048.84s]  Like it's probably like I typically would play the game for like a few hours.
[5049.40s -> 5051.24s]  Take out some things that I thought were fun.
[5051.24s -> 5052.92s]  Play for like another hour or two the next day.
[5052.92s -> 5056.60s]  Or take edit some stuff together and be making the kind of the video as it went along.
[5057.32s -> 5063.12s]  And it just they changed the game like halfway through when I was making the video.
[5064.14s -> 5065.02s]  It was really weird.
[5076.35s -> 5078.03s]  Scare Saturdays.
[5078.03s -> 5084.35s]  Let me go over here.
[5090.35s -> 5090.91s]  Rat Burger.
[5090.91s -> 5092.27s]  We'll do we'll do Rat Burger.
[5092.27s -> 5094.11s]  Rat Burgers and I haven't seen that one in a long time either.
[5106.59s -> 5107.07s]  Let's see.
[5111.04s -> 5111.84s]  Welcome to Rat.
[5111.84s -> 5114.08s]  Five more than five years ago.
[5114.08s -> 5118.08s]  This was May March 18th 2014.
[5118.08s -> 5121.12s]  This is five years ago now.
[5121.12s -> 5124.78s]  That's a long long time ago.
[5124.78s -> 5125.82s]  I was just a young man.
[5137.15s -> 5143.76s]  I was just a young boy back then.
[5149.02s -> 5150.46s]  This like that.
[5151.02s -> 5157.87s]  Okay let's take a look.
[5159.45s -> 5160.09s]  Rat Burger.
[5160.81s -> 5166.24s]  29 is still young adult.
[5166.24s -> 5167.68s]  Haven't you guys played Alter Ego?
[5167.68s -> 5169.12s]  I know haven't you played Alter Ego?
[5179.00s -> 5179.32s]  Hi.
[5182.59s -> 5184.11s]  Where do we make the cheeseburgers?
[5187.32s -> 5189.08s]  I love how we each have a different.
[5189.08s -> 5190.76s]  All right wait wait wait wait wait stealth.
[5190.76s -> 5192.20s]  No no no no no do not just stop.
[5192.20s -> 5193.56s]  This is what he's doing.
[5193.56s -> 5194.20s]  That's not me.
[5194.20s -> 5194.84s]  Oh shit.
[5196.44s -> 5198.04s]  Why are you star's girlfriend?
[5198.04s -> 5198.52s]  No no.
[5199.32s -> 5200.52s]  I thought we were doing the tape.
[5200.52s -> 5200.92s]  Oh yeah.
[5203.48s -> 5203.80s]  All right.
[5203.80s -> 5208.60s]  Something important to note here is this game was so early in its development.
[5208.60s -> 5209.72s]  It was like a super alpha.
[5210.44s -> 5212.44s]  There was no restart.
[5212.44s -> 5222.03s]  There was no redo game or put the do a do a reset or you had to physically everyone had
[5222.03s -> 5225.31s]  to close the game to get these cheeseburgers back up here on the shelf.
[5226.57s -> 5228.65s]  You had to close everyone had to close out their games.
[5228.65s -> 5233.29s]  Everyone had to restart their games and the process to get anybody into a server was
[5233.29s -> 5235.13s]  this crazy roundabout.
[5235.13s -> 5237.45s]  There was like three servers that existed I think in the whole game.
[5238.09s -> 5243.13s]  It was a unity browser game that was hard to get people in multiplayer.
[5244.27s -> 5247.82s]  So it was this was very hard.
[5247.82s -> 5251.18s]  This took us like I remember like this like two hours had gone by at this point
[5251.18s -> 5254.38s]  and we finally fucking got it and got it to work and we were all ready to like record.
[5255.47s -> 5258.83s]  Remember if you fucked it up we had to do the whole thing again.
[5258.83s -> 5263.13s]  So like that's why I'm like don't don't don't what the fuck are you doing please.
[5263.13s -> 5266.28s]  Just because that we would have to start over.
[5266.28s -> 5267.96s]  Didn't star wake up in the middle of his sleep.
[5268.04s -> 5270.60s]  Yeah I I we needed a fourth person.
[5271.24s -> 5273.40s]  So I just like hit up star like I texted him.
[5273.40s -> 5276.36s]  I'm like hey dude come play this burger game it's gonna be fun.
[5276.36s -> 5278.36s]  He was asleep and I was like come on play this game please.
[5279.00s -> 5281.72s]  And I woke him up I didn't dead sleep.
[5281.72s -> 5285.64s]  And within I don't know maybe like 30 minutes or 20 minutes of being awake.
[5285.64s -> 5288.12s]  I was like we're trying to multiplayer just get in here's like the server is
[5288.12s -> 5291.16s]  what you have to do and he was just barely awake at this point.
[5291.16s -> 5301.52s]  Start over.
[5301.52s -> 5303.13s]  Hi.
[5303.13s -> 5305.61s]  He just didn't want to be here at all and he didn't give a fuck if he was
[5305.61s -> 5306.49s]  gonna fuck it all up.
[5307.45s -> 5309.77s]  So what's the first thing he does.
[5309.77s -> 5311.53s]  I love how we each have a different.
[5311.53s -> 5313.21s]  All right wait wait wait wait wait wait stealth.
[5313.21s -> 5316.01s]  No no no no no do not just stop this is what he's doing.
[5316.01s -> 5316.65s]  That's not me.
[5316.65s -> 5317.37s]  Oh shit.
[5318.89s -> 5320.49s]  Why are you star's girlfriend?
[5320.49s -> 5320.97s]  No no no.
[5325.29s -> 5326.33s]  He's just doing his own thing.
[5326.33s -> 5327.37s]  So I can't control.
[5327.37s -> 5331.05s]  He's just okay star is just doing his own thing this whole video.
[5331.98s -> 5335.82s]  He's just like not even in this video he's just doing his own thing.
[5337.28s -> 5338.72s]  Hold his mouth sensitivity.
[5338.72s -> 5340.72s]  You have to turn your like DPI down.
[5340.72s -> 5341.92s]  I can't fight my mouth.
[5343.44s -> 5343.92s]  So high.
[5344.88s -> 5350.08s]  All right you are seriously you are seriously messing this whole thing up you guys.
[5350.08s -> 5353.04s]  We were supposed to build burgers you guys are just taking all the ingredients
[5353.04s -> 5354.64s]  and throwing them all over the place.
[5354.64s -> 5356.24s]  We got people coming on the floor.
[5356.24s -> 5357.12s]  We have customers.
[5357.84s -> 5358.80s]  I'm going to say hi.
[5358.80s -> 5361.92s]  Look you need to look at like the note board to see what we have to do.
[5361.92s -> 5369.76s]  I'm just watching star like literally just hold his hands out and just hold left to right.
[5372.16s -> 5373.44s]  What are you doing?
[5375.32s -> 5377.80s]  I'm trying to fix it.
[5377.80s -> 5382.52s]  You have just like single-handedly destroyed what we were doing.
[5384.92s -> 5388.68s]  Can we actually make a burger or are you guys just going to be dipshits this whole time?
[5389.64s -> 5392.44s]  Look at come out here you sprint you can sprint.
[5396.43s -> 5399.55s]  I had this grand idea that we were going to have like a burger contest and
[5400.27s -> 5403.87s]  do some maybe like some light RP right.
[5403.87s -> 5408.08s]  They were just fucking throwing shit on the grill.
[5408.96s -> 5413.98s]  I had this like this grand idea.
[5414.78s -> 5419.68s]  Girl are you guys just going to be dipshits this whole time?
[5420.64s -> 5423.44s]  Look at come out here you sprint you can sprint.
[5425.31s -> 5426.83s]  I figured I'd just change the field of view.
[5426.83s -> 5428.59s]  There are people out here looking for cheeseburgers.
[5428.59s -> 5429.63s]  This guy wants a bacon burger.
[5429.63s -> 5430.99s]  All right we gotta we gotta set this up.
[5430.99s -> 5432.11s]  This guy wants a bacon burger.
[5432.11s -> 5432.67s]  This guy wants.
[5432.67s -> 5434.11s]  There's so many people in here.
[5443.80s -> 5445.16s]  There is a burger patty.
[5445.16s -> 5446.04s]  She's not happy.
[5447.08s -> 5448.20s]  All right who wanted the lettuce?
[5448.84s -> 5455.16s]  No nobody will all right seriously meeting team meeting team meeting.
[5455.88s -> 5457.56s]  Oh the manager is displeased.
[5457.56s -> 5458.44s]  I am not happy.
[5458.44s -> 5460.84s]  You guys one of you guys is getting fired.
[5461.72s -> 5464.48s]  Hey look at all this stuff on the grill.
[5464.48s -> 5465.28s]  Yeah it's all burnt.
[5465.28s -> 5466.80s]  Go to the front desk go to the front.
[5466.80s -> 5467.52s]  I got a burger.
[5468.24s -> 5470.32s]  Wait what do you mean what are you talking about?
[5480.43s -> 5481.63s]  He took the patty.
[5481.63s -> 5482.59s]  Catch it someone.
[5482.59s -> 5482.99s]  Catch it.
[5483.71s -> 5484.35s]  I caught it.
[5487.39s -> 5488.43s]  She's still there.
[5488.43s -> 5489.31s]  Where's my burger?
[5490.75s -> 5492.19s]  Oh he snagged it.
[5492.19s -> 5494.19s]  Oh no this look at look at this trail of rats.
[5495.95s -> 5497.39s]  They're all it's like a rat fight.
[5497.39s -> 5498.99s]  They're all going after this one piece of meat.
[5500.83s -> 5501.63s]  This one guy.
[5502.91s -> 5503.79s]  Don't let them get away.
[5504.99s -> 5506.99s]  We are chasing this rat all the way down the street.
[5508.49s -> 5509.85s]  Come here you son of a bitch.
[5511.61s -> 5511.93s]  I got it.
[5511.93s -> 5512.65s]  I don't think you can.
[5512.65s -> 5513.77s]  I got the rat.
[5518.57s -> 5519.85s]  Look at all these people just watching.
[5521.05s -> 5522.25s]  I caught the wrong one.
[5522.25s -> 5524.01s]  Can we actually play this game?
[5525.53s -> 5526.17s]  We're not.
[5526.97s -> 5527.37s]  Hold on.
[5527.37s -> 5528.41s]  Everyone get in the back.
[5528.41s -> 5529.45s]  These rats are burned.
[5530.17s -> 5530.89s]  They are crisp.
[5534.94s -> 5536.06s]  They're not even they're dead.
[5536.06s -> 5536.54s]  They're black.
[5536.54s -> 5538.78s]  Hey guys it's okay we can finish the rat burger.
[5538.78s -> 5539.58s]  I found the patty.
[5539.58s -> 5540.94s]  These rats are burned.
[5540.94s -> 5542.22s]  Get the rat and put it on the bun.
[5548.67s -> 5549.79s]  I'm crying right now.
[5551.12s -> 5553.44s]  This is so stupid.
[5554.16s -> 5556.48s]  Okay can we please restart this and just like I don't have any
[5557.28s -> 5558.64s]  fucking rats everywhere.
[5563.52s -> 5564.72s]  I don't even know how you draw.
[5564.72s -> 5566.56s]  Like how do you like even control this?
[5566.56s -> 5568.80s]  I think it screws up in multiplayer.
[5571.36s -> 5572.96s]  And then that's did I just.
[5572.96s -> 5574.64s]  It looks like that's two-year-old drawing.
[5576.00s -> 5576.88s]  You're holding two.
[5577.52s -> 5578.72s]  All right so.
[5578.72s -> 5580.08s]  All right no no follow me though.
[5580.08s -> 5582.16s]  There is a prisoner back here.
[5582.16s -> 5583.04s]  There's a person back here.
[5583.04s -> 5584.80s]  Oh my god you fucking idiot.
[5584.80s -> 5585.68s]  What are you doing?
[5585.68s -> 5587.12s]  We just remade this game.
[5588.16s -> 5589.20s]  Remember keep in mind.
[5589.20s -> 5591.36s]  Keep in mind we just started this again.
[5592.08s -> 5597.55s]  This was like a all right three two one let's go right.

[5601.31s -> 5602.75s]  A prisoner back here.
[5602.75s -> 5603.63s]  There's a person back.
[5603.63s -> 5605.47s]  Oh my god you fucking idiot.
[5605.47s -> 5606.27s]  What are you doing?
[5606.27s -> 5608.11s]  We just remade this game.
[5613.13s -> 5613.93s]  You're fired.
[5615.23s -> 5615.79s]  There's a person.
[5615.79s -> 5616.91s]  What's this a guy in here?
[5616.91s -> 5618.59s]  I know that's what I was saying.
[5618.59s -> 5619.47s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[5620.27s -> 5622.40s]  Can we like punch him?
[5622.40s -> 5623.84s]  He is the rat mama.
[5624.40s -> 5625.20s]  Can I pick him up?
[5625.20s -> 5626.72s]  What if you could pick him up and like.
[5626.72s -> 5628.24s]  You make like a person sandwich.
[5629.58s -> 5631.10s]  No I oh no.
[5631.74s -> 5633.66s]  All right you can lock people in.
[5633.66s -> 5636.86s]  No we all conspired against you.
[5636.86s -> 5638.46s]  Yeah it's just like all at once.
[5642.30s -> 5643.66s]  I am completely locked.
[5643.66s -> 5645.42s]  There's no way I'm getting out of this.
[5645.42s -> 5646.94s]  We did that very silently.
[5646.94s -> 5647.74s]  We all knew.
[5647.74s -> 5648.54s]  You dicks.
[5649.18s -> 5650.06s]  It's just me and like.
[5650.06s -> 5651.26s]  Is it like let us bricks.
[5651.26s -> 5652.22s]  I don't know what that's supposed to be.
[5655.34s -> 5657.10s]  He's like fighting through the trouble.
[5657.10s -> 5658.30s]  I'm fighting through.
[5664.30s -> 5665.74s]  Also we're wearing bandanas and.
[5665.74s -> 5666.86s]  Again take three.
[5668.86s -> 5670.78s]  Okay star you're not allowed to look.
[5671.66s -> 5672.62s]  Not allowed to look.
[5672.62s -> 5673.98s]  No because you're the burger judge.
[5673.98s -> 5674.94s]  There's people coming in.
[5674.94s -> 5675.74s]  There's customers.
[5676.94s -> 5678.06s]  Do you see what I did here.
[5678.06s -> 5680.06s]  This is some fucking 4D chess.
[5680.06s -> 5681.42s]  Star you're the judge.
[5681.42s -> 5682.78s]  You have to be on the other side.
[5683.74s -> 5685.82s]  You have to be on the other side.
[5685.82s -> 5686.62s]  Not in the kitchen.
[5688.33s -> 5689.53s]  That's some yeah.
[5689.53s -> 5690.89s]  I made sure to get him out of the kitchen.
[5692.51s -> 5693.87s]  No because you're the burger judge.
[5693.87s -> 5694.83s]  There's people coming in.
[5694.83s -> 5695.63s]  There's customers.
[5696.27s -> 5697.07s]  I'll talk the people down.
[5697.07s -> 5698.51s]  You got to show them to their seats.
[5698.51s -> 5700.11s]  I'll lower their expectation.
[5700.11s -> 5701.23s]  Lower their expectations.
[5701.23s -> 5702.51s]  Because they're going to probably throw up.
[5702.51s -> 5703.55s]  After eating one of our burgers.
[5704.51s -> 5705.39s]  I'm going to go.
[5705.39s -> 5706.11s]  You look mad.
[5706.27s -> 5707.55s]  Oh I picked something up.
[5707.55s -> 5708.83s]  Yeah still we have to make burgers.
[5708.83s -> 5710.51s]  We have to make our own delicious cheese.
[5710.51s -> 5712.51s]  You must be proud of yourself.
[5712.51s -> 5713.39s]  All right my second rule.
[5713.39s -> 5714.59s]  Start with the bun.
[5714.59s -> 5717.55s]  And hey I have everyone get away from each other.
[5717.55s -> 5718.91s]  Because we're just going to knock into stuff.
[5718.91s -> 5720.35s]  I'll take my stuff into the bathroom.
[5722.19s -> 5725.39s]  So here's my burger station is going to be right next to the sink.
[5727.07s -> 5728.19s]  In the bathroom.
[5728.19s -> 5729.63s]  Yeah I'll be I'll be in the bathroom.
[5729.63s -> 5731.15s]  You can use the bad controller.
[5732.59s -> 5734.11s]  Oh well the cheese is completely.
[5734.59s -> 5736.91s]  My cheese seriously is just like a black tile.
[5736.91s -> 5737.95s]  You don't put the cheese on the grill.
[5737.95s -> 5738.91s]  I wanted to like melt it.
[5738.91s -> 5740.59s]  You don't put the cheese.
[5740.59s -> 5741.79s]  You can put cheese on the grill.
[5741.79s -> 5742.99s]  Hey well get out of my station.
[5742.99s -> 5744.27s]  You can put cheese on the grill.
[5744.27s -> 5744.83s]  You.
[5744.83s -> 5745.31s]  No you can't.
[5745.31s -> 5745.63s]  Can you?
[5745.63s -> 5745.95s]  Sick.
[5748.83s -> 5749.79s]  Son of a bitch.
[5749.79s -> 5752.19s]  He just dropped my burger in the fucking sink.
[5753.23s -> 5755.63s]  Hey hey you don't got to you got to play to win.
[5755.63s -> 5756.11s]  Oh my.
[5760.72s -> 5762.24s]  Star just pretend like you didn't hear that.
[5762.24s -> 5763.92s]  It's a Krabby Patty.
[5763.92s -> 5765.36s]  What are you doing back here?
[5765.36s -> 5767.12s]  How are you like multiplying these bacons?
[5767.12s -> 5769.28s]  Star come back here.
[5769.28s -> 5771.12s]  One come back here.
[5771.12s -> 5771.76s]  What's going on?
[5771.76s -> 5773.76s]  I know how to break everything.
[5773.76s -> 5774.40s]  Where are you?
[5774.40s -> 5776.08s]  It's like duping the back room.
[5776.08s -> 5777.12s]  He's duping.
[5777.84s -> 5778.56s]  What the hell?
[5779.20s -> 5781.95s]  How did you get all this baconator?
[5781.95s -> 5783.47s]  I'm the baconator.
[5783.47s -> 5784.51s]  Who's under the ground?
[5784.51s -> 5785.55s]  Jerma you're under the ground.
[5785.55s -> 5786.43s]  What the fuck?
[5786.43s -> 5787.15s]  Oh no.
[5790.35s -> 5792.27s]  We didn't get to do the thing I wanted to do.
[5792.27s -> 5793.15s]  I'm so hard on this.
[5795.15s -> 5795.65s]  Where am I?
[5798.75s -> 5799.63s]  Somebody else fell.
[5799.63s -> 5800.51s]  Somebody else fell.
[5802.91s -> 5805.31s]  You're gonna see the tiny little guy fall.
[5805.31s -> 5806.19s]  Who just fell?
[5807.64s -> 5809.80s]  You went whizzing by my screen.
[5812.33s -> 5812.83s]  Yeah.
[5814.97s -> 5818.01s]  I wanted to make like cheeseburgers and have a cheeseburger contest.
[5818.73s -> 5828.09s]  Apparently not though.
[5828.09s -> 5831.37s]  Jerma is he's reliving his frustrations.
[5832.01s -> 5835.10s]  He's doing it all over again.
[5835.10s -> 5836.70s]  He's seeing why he was so angry.
[5840.00s -> 5840.80s]  Spy party.
[5847.87s -> 5849.71s]  What about the New Vegas time gun?
[5851.16s -> 5854.04s]  I haven't seen that in a long time but that one that was fucking crazy.
[5858.09s -> 5859.69s]  Fun facts for everybody here.
[5859.69s -> 5861.85s]  If you're a new viewer to the stream that is
[5865.05s -> 5868.73s]  that is one of the first streams I ever did moving to Twitch.
[5870.91s -> 5871.63s]  Very early.
[5871.63s -> 5875.15s]  I think that was had to been the first five to ten streams ever right?
[5877.02s -> 5879.82s]  It's another one of those where I start to not be able to breathe.
[5881.10s -> 5882.30s]  I can't control myself.
[5883.77s -> 5884.33s]  Let's try.
[5884.33s -> 5884.89s]  Let's watch it.
[5886.40s -> 5889.12s]  Didn't you stream Minecraft in like 2012?
[5889.12s -> 5890.40s]  No I had like a Twitch account.
[5890.40s -> 5893.04s]  I had like an old Twitch account and I would use it sometimes.
[5893.04s -> 5897.28s]  I streamed on YouTube sometimes but it wasn't until like 2014
[5898.16s -> 5901.52s]  that I moved and started doing Twitch seriously.
[5902.08s -> 5905.20s]  Like taking it very seriously and streaming three or four times a week
[5905.20s -> 5907.68s]  and that was like late 2014 I think right?
[5910.72s -> 5911.60s]  YouTube streaming.
[5911.60s -> 5915.28s]  Yeah it wasn't very good when I was doing it.
[5915.28s -> 5917.28s]  That's why I chose to do Twitch instead.
[5921.88s -> 5923.00s]  Internet come on.
[5923.00s -> 5928.19s]  Let's close this.
[5933.07s -> 5934.19s]  My title changed right?
[5939.45s -> 5942.57s]  Yeah I'm just making sure the title actually changed.
[5942.57s -> 5943.37s]  All right what was it gonna do?
[5943.37s -> 5946.70s]  We're gonna do this one.
[5952.27s -> 5952.75s]  Stop.
[5952.75s -> 5961.15s]  There we go.
[5964.36s -> 5964.76s]  Stop.
[5968.64s -> 5970.48s]  Stop wasting my time.
[5978.81s -> 5983.10s]  All right here we go.
[5983.10s -> 5984.06s]  This is all streamed.
[5984.06s -> 5989.85s]  So this is gonna be so I'm so I streamed this at a low bit rate too.
[5990.91s -> 5995.21s]  This is back like 2500 I think bit rate.
[5996.32s -> 6001.85s]  I stream now at 6000.
[6001.85s -> 6006.41s]  So this is old bit rate that was pulled and made into a video
[6006.41s -> 6010.73s]  now being streamed through through Twitch again
[6011.61s -> 6014.25s]  with like shitty internet problems today.
[6014.25s -> 6015.76s]  This is gonna be interesting.
[6015.76s -> 6016.56s]  We'll see how this looks.
[6017.20s -> 6018.73s]  Here we go.
[6018.73s -> 6023.32s]  Ready?
[6023.32s -> 6025.88s]  Oh wait I know you're gonna hear that line like four times
[6025.88s -> 6032.62s]  but hold on let me is this god damn it.
[6032.62s -> 6034.86s]  I knew it was frozen for I knew it was frozen.
[6035.72s -> 6037.16s]  I knew it was frozen.
[6037.80s -> 6044.54s]  There we go.
[6044.54s -> 6047.50s]  No don't be frozen please.
[6048.38s -> 6058.14s]  Sorry sometimes when I interact with a browser it freezes the whole thing.
[6059.58s -> 6077.12s]  I don't know why.
[6077.12s -> 6081.82s]  Okay all right there we go.
[6083.15s -> 6089.04s]  Finally put it on the screen.
[6089.04s -> 6091.52s]  Geez that took fucking long enough.
[6091.52s -> 6092.48s]  Here we go.
[6096.44s -> 6097.72s]  Go waste Jason's.
[6105.93s -> 6109.85s]  Fuck you I came here for a mission and I'm gonna do my mission.
[6110.65s -> 6112.09s]  You fucking ghouls.
[6112.09s -> 6113.45s]  So should I just fucking kill this guy?
[6115.74s -> 6116.22s]  You got it.
[6118.36s -> 6118.92s]  I missed.
[6120.44s -> 6122.92s]  Oh don't don't don't don't go sir.
[6122.92s -> 6124.68s]  I was just playing with you.
[6124.68s -> 6126.44s]  I just didn't want you to know that this was coming for you.
[6134.43s -> 6137.15s]  You can run but you can't hide.
[6139.13s -> 6140.01s]  Let's get in it.
[6141.05s -> 6142.33s]  Also very important to note.
[6142.97s -> 6143.85s]  This is important to note.
[6145.45s -> 6149.37s]  This is the first time I've played Fallout New Vegas and I just I was just fucking killing people.
[6150.01s -> 6155.24s]  I just was like slaughtering people.
[6156.49s -> 6159.53s]  And I didn't know I never ended up finishing Fallout New Vegas.
[6160.56s -> 6169.16s]  Because I got to a point where I was spawning 500 easy peets and I couldn't play it anymore.
[6169.16s -> 6171.56s]  I couldn't do I could I can't play Skyrim anymore either.
[6175.12s -> 6178.72s]  I've said it before of any time someone's like hey cheat like put that add this do this.
[6179.36s -> 6183.20s]  At some point you just you've ruined the whole thing and you can never play the game normal ever again.
[6187.77s -> 6189.05s]  Step in that asshole Larry.
[6189.69s -> 6191.45s]  Step inside that asshole Larry.
[6191.45s -> 6193.29s]  I'm so lost in here.
[6194.84s -> 6196.04s]  Where the fuck do I go?
[6197.84s -> 6198.96s]  Everything's the same.
[6200.83s -> 6202.11s]  God help me.
[6202.11s -> 6202.99s]  Derma blind.
[6202.99s -> 6203.79s]  Derma blind.
[6203.79s -> 6204.19s]  Blind.
[6204.19s -> 6205.23s]  My computers.
[6205.23s -> 6207.15s]  If I touch a computer it'll save me.
[6207.15s -> 6209.87s]  Oh my fucking god I'm just gonna throw everything in the trash.
[6209.87s -> 6210.91s]  I don't fucking even care.
[6212.19s -> 6212.75s]  No I need that.
[6213.55s -> 6214.67s]  I need my space suit back.
[6217.20s -> 6219.36s]  Did I lose the space suit?
[6219.36s -> 6220.24s]  Where's the space suit?
[6220.24s -> 6220.72s]  Where'd it go?
[6223.55s -> 6224.19s]  Fuck.
[6224.19s -> 6226.43s]  Did George Washington take shortcuts?
[6228.03s -> 6233.53s]  Did Bill Gates?
[6233.53s -> 6234.81s]  I couldn't think of another person.
[6237.26s -> 6239.42s]  Took me that long to think of another successful person.
[6242.80s -> 6244.78s]  No they didn't.
[6244.78s -> 6252.68s]  Did Christopher Columbus take a shortcut?
[6254.01s -> 6256.06s]  No they didn't.
[6256.06s -> 6257.26s]  I should have taken this shortcut.
[6257.90s -> 6259.18s]  I should have taken this shortcut.
[6259.18s -> 6260.22s]  Fuck George Washington.
[6260.22s -> 6261.42s]  I should have taken the shortcut.
[6261.42s -> 6262.54s]  I should have taken the shortcut.
[6263.26s -> 6266.11s]  Should have taken the fucking shortcut.
[6266.83s -> 6269.69s]  I'm scared the fuck out of here.
[6270.91s -> 6272.19s]  Oh I had no clip to the door.
[6272.19s -> 6273.07s]  There it is I found it.
[6273.71s -> 6274.67s]  I think I found it.
[6275.31s -> 6279.31s]  Yeah I think it's this way.
[6280.03s -> 6280.67s]  Where is it?
[6280.67s -> 6282.43s]  Uh oh it's down that way.
[6282.43s -> 6282.99s]  To the left.
[6283.63s -> 6284.35s]  Up into the right.
[6286.25s -> 6287.21s]  I think it's right over here.
[6288.57s -> 6289.69s]  How do I get a better view?
[6290.33s -> 6290.89s]  Oh I know.
[6295.85s -> 6296.73s]  See I already lost it.
[6296.73s -> 6296.97s]  It's over.
[6296.97s -> 6298.81s]  I can't play the game the same ever again.
[6298.81s -> 6300.14s]  I can't get a better view.
[6303.47s -> 6311.95s]  The first step is always no clip.
[6311.95s -> 6312.35s]  That's true.
[6313.15s -> 6314.27s]  That's always the first step.
[6319.07s -> 6320.43s]  Yep let's go.
[6327.08s -> 6328.68s]  Yeah give him a speech.
[6340.57s -> 6341.93s]  Dynamite joke incoming.
[6346.16s -> 6347.60s]  Oh you couldn't even interact with it.
[6349.20s -> 6350.96s]  Holy shit that's wicked loud.
[6353.66s -> 6355.02s]  Look at how loud this is.
[6357.66s -> 6358.46s]  Are you serious?
[6360.54s -> 6361.66s]  That's so loud.
[6364.30s -> 6365.10s]  Holy shit.
[6365.10s -> 6366.06s]  Wait what?
[6370.03s -> 6371.47s]  No it's no cheating.
[6371.47s -> 6373.15s]  No I just I saw it.
[6373.15s -> 6373.55s]  I just want to see.
[6373.55s -> 6373.95s]  I want to look.
[6373.95s -> 6374.51s]  I just want to take a look.
[6374.51s -> 6375.39s]  I just want to see what's in there.
[6376.19s -> 6381.95s]  This is where it goes off the rails.
[6381.95s -> 6383.07s]  This is an odd picture.
[6384.92s -> 6386.60s]  Why is this behind a locked door?
[6389.39s -> 6392.11s]  Some random guy singing to one person in the audience.
[6392.11s -> 6394.35s]  And his clone is sitting in this seat smoking.
[6395.07s -> 6396.41s]  What a secret.
[6397.05s -> 6400.16s]  What a fucking secret huh?
[6402.80s -> 6403.36s]  Is this right?
[6403.36s -> 6403.68s]  Here it comes.
[6403.68s -> 6404.48s]  Somebody just put one in.
[6405.04s -> 6407.79s]  I'm gonna believe this guy.
[6421.85s -> 6423.13s]  Spawn this Jerma.
[6423.13s -> 6424.01s]  Spawn this.
[6424.01s -> 6425.21s]  This will help you.
[6425.21s -> 6428.01s]  And then it's just it's always easy peeps.
[6431.21s -> 6433.79s]  Oh this is where.
[6433.79s -> 6435.31s]  Didn't I notice that they're funny?
[6450.88s -> 6451.92s]  This was so funny.
[6454.09s -> 6459.71s]  I cry a lot it seems.
[6463.58s -> 6481.10s]  Oh look at the guy in the back.
[6482.70s -> 6485.90s]  They turn like they get torn through like four dimensions.
[6488.22s -> 6490.43s]  Look at his eyes.
[6490.43s -> 6492.75s]  Look at this one's fucking eyes.
[6504.40s -> 6505.52s]  Why is this happening?
[6506.08s -> 6507.28s]  Why was this happening?
[6509.50s -> 6510.78s]  I lost all control.
[6518.68s -> 6519.72s]  Oh my god.
[6521.05s -> 6522.73s]  I forgot how heinous this was.
[6526.28s -> 6528.36s]  Why are they exploding?
[6528.36s -> 6529.88s]  I don't know.
[6529.88s -> 6530.92s]  I don't get it.
[6530.92s -> 6531.88s]  I don't get it.
[6531.88s -> 6533.58s]  Stop.
[6535.72s -> 6536.22s]  Stop.
[6539.08s -> 6540.60s]  I don't it's too laggy.
[6540.60s -> 6541.88s]  It's a little too laggy.
[6543.00s -> 6543.96s]  They're hurting.
[6543.96s -> 6544.60s]  That hurt.
[6545.24s -> 6546.44s]  That hurt.
[6547.32s -> 6548.04s]  That hurt.
[6548.04s -> 6548.60s]  Stop.
[6548.60s -> 6549.10s]  Stop.
[6564.12s -> 6564.68s]  What was that?
[6564.68s -> 6565.48s]  That's not easy Pete.
[6566.20s -> 6567.24s]  That's not easy Pete.
[6567.96s -> 6569.56s]  This is not easy Pete.
[6573.93s -> 6574.65s]  Oh fuck.
[6575.45s -> 6576.41s]  Oh fuck.
[6576.41s -> 6577.85s]  Who is the flamethrower?
[6577.85s -> 6579.45s]  That's not easy Pete either.
[6579.45s -> 6580.57s]  That's not easy Pete.
[6582.16s -> 6583.52s]  Oh god he's naked.
[6583.52s -> 6584.08s]  Nudity.
[6587.84s -> 6589.44s]  Oh god nudity.
[6599.79s -> 6602.59s]  A second time and he turns.
[6604.59s -> 6605.63s]  It's almost like.
[6605.63s -> 6607.63s]  It's almost like this is a weapon.
[6608.51s -> 6611.95s]  You remember the Bart Simpson game where you had that thing to show that people were aliens?
[6613.58s -> 6614.30s]  It was like that.
[6614.30s -> 6618.06s]  It was like I had to hit that guy twice with the show me you're an alien weapon.
[6618.06s -> 6622.03s]  That's not easy Pete.
[6623.55s -> 6626.81s]  Fucking not funny.
[6626.81s -> 6630.41s]  I swear to god if this guy turns into like a fucking cheese pizza when I kill him I'm gonna die.
[6631.37s -> 6636.35s]  Oh no I'm at zero.
[6637.96s -> 6639.24s]  Are we good?
[6640.46s -> 6641.26s]  Oh god this is.
[6641.26s -> 6641.66s]  Uh oh.
[6642.22s -> 6643.68s]  Have we reached the end?
[6644.24s -> 6647.45s]  We may have reached the end of the.
[6647.45s -> 6648.89s]  We're at the end of the line here.
[6648.89s -> 6661.29s]  I think we're okay.
[6662.01s -> 6664.17s]  I think we're okay.
[6666.89s -> 6668.17s]  I think we were right here.
[6669.21s -> 6669.85s]  Oh god.
[6669.85s -> 6670.41s]  Yeah we're right here.
[6670.41s -> 6670.89s]  Nudity.
[6670.89s -> 6672.01s]  Because I said this thing.
[6672.89s -> 6674.35s]  Ah nah nah nah.
[6674.35s -> 6674.91s]  Hold on hold on.
[6675.79s -> 6677.37s]  Uh oh.
[6677.37s -> 6681.37s]  Well if we go out completely then they're supposed to fix this tomorrow
[6681.37s -> 6682.33s]  and I'm gonna let them do it.
[6682.33s -> 6683.29s]  I won't be live tomorrow.
[6683.29s -> 6684.41s]  Let's just let them do it.
[6685.56s -> 6686.52s]  And we'll come back again.
[6687.76s -> 6690.40s]  I'm hoping that I don't have to.
[6691.96s -> 6694.22s]  We're getting a lot of red.
[6694.22s -> 6697.58s]  I'm sincerely hoping that I don't have to spend more than one day trying to get them
[6697.58s -> 6700.38s]  because he said that they were gonna get on this tomorrow.
[6700.38s -> 6702.46s]  So hopefully I can go Tuesday.
[6705.12s -> 6706.56s]  Just in case we cut out completely.
[6711.10s -> 6711.58s]  Here we go.
[6723.34s -> 6724.94s]  Okay that was not easy Pete.
[6725.50s -> 6726.54s]  That was not easy Pete.
[6727.92s -> 6731.36s]  It's never fucking not funny.
[6731.36s -> 6734.56s]  I swear to god if this guy turns into like a fucking cheese pizza when I kill him I'm
[6734.56s -> 6734.96s]  gonna die.
[6736.60s -> 6738.04s]  They do don't they?
[6738.04s -> 6738.60s]  I forget.
[6742.25s -> 6744.09s]  Oh yeah they oh yes they do.
[6747.58s -> 6750.38s]  They just turned into a fucking museum statue.
[6751.68s -> 6752.32s]  Look at this.
[6753.12s -> 6758.20s]  Look at this guy's face.
[6758.20s -> 6759.64s]  Look at this guy's face.
[6759.64s -> 6760.20s]  Oh yeah.
[6762.68s -> 6763.72s]  He's like oh fuck.
[6763.72s -> 6764.52s]  He can't believe it.
[6764.52s -> 6765.88s]  He can't fucking believe it.
[6774.92s -> 6776.12s]  This is unreal.
[6777.53s -> 6779.05s]  This shit is fucking unreal.
[6779.05s -> 6780.49s]  It's a time gun.
[6781.45s -> 6782.65s]  I just don't I don't have any words.
[6782.65s -> 6783.61s]  There's no words to explain it.
[6784.96s -> 6787.44s]  I'm freezing them in time and ripping their bodies.
[6792.48s -> 6795.20s]  That's fucking crazy though really.
[6795.20s -> 6796.80s]  They look like dead space enemies.
[6804.67s -> 6806.03s]  Like gum people.
[6806.03s -> 6807.23s]  Like jello people.
[6808.19s -> 6808.99s]  Taffy people.
[6811.79s -> 6814.19s]  I made this person in dreams two weeks ago.
[6815.13s -> 6821.34s]  Whoa what I think I found the secret.
[6822.99s -> 6825.79s]  If you turn uh-oh I think I might have broke it.
[6825.79s -> 6826.99s]  I don't think it's gonna happen anymore.
[6835.64s -> 6837.96s]  It really never it's never not funny.
[6839.08s -> 6839.56s]  Come on.
[6846.48s -> 6847.52s]  Kill the other one.
[6847.52s -> 6848.24s]  Kill the other one.
[6848.88s -> 6854.38s]  Fuck.
[6854.38s -> 6855.42s]  Why are you so good?
[6857.00s -> 6858.20s]  Are you seriously this good?
[6859.61s -> 6861.29s]  Fuck you stop being such a good shot.
[6863.08s -> 6863.32s]  What?
[6866.48s -> 6867.44s]  What the fuck?
[6868.89s -> 6869.61s]  No way.
[6871.93s -> 6873.05s]  No fucking way.

[6876.27s -> 6876.59s]  Come on.
[6876.59s -> 6877.15s]  Moment of truth.
[6887.20s -> 6891.93s]  You know typically I would be upset about this but you earned it man.
[6893.04s -> 6893.60s]  You earned it.
[6893.60s -> 6894.64s]  Look now he just wants a drink.
[6897.02s -> 6897.74s]  You earned it dude.
[6898.46s -> 6900.03s]  You earned your drink.
[6904.32s -> 6905.44s]  Bottoms up.
[6905.44s -> 6909.47s]  I think there's more.
[6917.90s -> 6918.30s]  Sark.
[6919.02s -> 6920.22s]  Oh yeah Sark came in.
[6921.90s -> 6924.38s]  A lot of closed casket funerals.
[6935.52s -> 6936.08s]  God it's.
[6938.96s -> 6942.00s]  I'm so happy that since that was like one of the first
[6942.56s -> 6946.56s]  so that was one of the first real couple weeks of streaming on twitch
[6947.36s -> 6952.08s]  and I'm like I still have that much fun like that's I still do that.
[6952.08s -> 6959.05s]  I still have that much fun in game still and that makes me happy that I can still have fun.
[6960.43s -> 6968.35s]  Hopefully it's still fun for you too because I feel like I'm just I love
[6970.36s -> 6973.96s]  being able to um to like because I don't really watch these.
[6973.96s -> 6974.36s]  I don't.
[6978.14s -> 6982.22s]  I watched like maybe maybe like a year or two ago.
[6982.22s -> 6984.38s]  I don't really watch old videos anymore.
[6985.02s -> 6991.72s]  All right let's do another one.
[6992.28s -> 6999.50s]  We spent seven hours watching you play a DOS text game for seven hours.
[6999.50s -> 7000.06s]  What do you think?
[7000.70s -> 7001.96s]  Well that makes me happy.
[7001.96s -> 7005.21s]  That's fucking I'm glad you still enjoy it.
[7005.21s -> 7006.84s]  All right let's do another one.
[7012.94s -> 7016.75s]  Let's do um it's always the monopoly guy.
[7016.75s -> 7018.20s]  That's a good one.
[7018.20s -> 7019.08s]  That is that's a good one.
[7019.08s -> 7022.00s]  That's a really good one from what I remember.
[7022.73s -> 7026.89s]  Stars Mike I think was also fucked during that this video as well.
[7026.89s -> 7028.43s]  If I remember correctly.
[7028.99s -> 7032.83s]  So let's get it on here.
[7043.88s -> 7046.04s]  It's always the monopoly guy.
[7046.04s -> 7052.27s]  This is this game out did this game ever really get completely bait?
[7054.76s -> 7056.60s]  That was an easy p jupiter.
[7056.60s -> 7066.64s]  Holy shit is this game should we play this again?
[7066.64s -> 7068.00s]  Should is it worth playing again?
[7070.54s -> 7073.98s]  This just this is the flashback episode in the sitcoms.
[7073.98s -> 7085.18s]  Oh you know now I gotta make it bigger.
[7085.74s -> 7090.43s]  All right let's do it.
[7097.52s -> 7106.70s]  Full screen HD 720p back when 720p was a big deal.
[7106.70s -> 7109.58s]  Back when 720p meant 720p.
[7109.58s -> 7111.66s]  Holy shit you got a video in HD.
[7111.66s -> 7113.56s]  I remember.
[7113.56s -> 7115.37s]  All right here we go.
[7115.37s -> 7117.90s]  Now that needs to be bigger.
[7117.90s -> 7124.54s]  Why is this not come on three two one let's go.
[7124.54s -> 7130.01s]  Oh you know you could be this guy with the book too.
[7130.01s -> 7131.85s]  This like monopoly man.
[7131.85s -> 7133.21s]  You're the fucking monopoly man.
[7137.82s -> 7139.10s]  Nope it wasn't me.
[7139.10s -> 7139.60s]  What?
[7140.80s -> 7143.14s]  And here comes the intro.
[7143.14s -> 7150.46s]  I'm pretty good at I'm pretty good at these things I think.
[7150.46s -> 7152.54s]  Well um you know I'm going to know what they are.
[7152.54s -> 7153.90s]  Yeah I know that's fine.
[7155.07s -> 7157.95s]  I love these N64 graphics I kind of miss them.
[7157.95s -> 7165.10s]  All right I'm ready.
[7165.10s -> 7165.74s]  Are you?
[7165.74s -> 7169.01s]  Because you're gonna pick the monopoly guy now.
[7169.01s -> 7170.69s]  I'm gonna see the monopoly guy.
[7170.69s -> 7172.53s]  We why why would I be that stupid?
[7172.53s -> 7175.97s]  Oh yeah let me pick the guy that you would just what I yeah that's a that's a great idea.
[7180.10s -> 7183.70s]  It's so scary it's so scary because I can see the the the laser.
[7185.81s -> 7186.69s]  Is it on your head?
[7187.57s -> 7188.61s]  No I can just see it.
[7188.61s -> 7190.05s]  I can see the laser.
[7190.05s -> 7193.25s]  I know well if you see the laser on your head of the monopoly.
[7193.25s -> 7195.17s]  I can see the laser pointing into the room.
[7195.17s -> 7196.93s]  That's all I'm telling you right now.
[7202.75s -> 7203.87s]  Does he get me here?
[7206.38s -> 7207.18s]  I'm just kidding.
[7209.42s -> 7210.46s]  No don't shoot me.
[7210.46s -> 7211.74s]  Don't don't shoot me.
[7212.54s -> 7216.00s]  Play in the psychology role.
[7216.00s -> 7217.68s]  Oh yeah well I'm gonna get you.
[7218.48s -> 7220.72s]  I think I've already got this figured out.
[7220.72s -> 7222.40s]  You should be scared right now.
[7222.40s -> 7223.52s]  You should be whimpering.
[7224.48s -> 7224.98s]  Fuck!
[7226.16s -> 7230.02s]  If that's the case these guys are all suspected double agents okay.
[7230.98s -> 7232.58s]  So that means you're over here somewhere.
[7235.09s -> 7236.37s]  You're in this crowd somewhere.
[7237.79s -> 7239.79s]  Of course I'm in this whole room is a crowd.
[7239.79s -> 7242.43s]  No no no you're in this crowd like over on the right.
[7242.43s -> 7244.11s]  Because these guys were suspected.
[7244.83s -> 7246.27s]  They were suspected criminals.
[7247.07s -> 7247.79s]  And you're over here.
[7247.79s -> 7249.15s]  You're one of these four people.
[7249.95s -> 7252.93s]  How could I possibly be one of these four people?
[7252.93s -> 7254.05s]  You're always the guy in the mustard jacket.
[7254.05s -> 7255.65s]  I think you're the guy in the mustard jacket.
[7255.65s -> 7256.15s]  Mm-hmm.
[7257.65s -> 7259.89s]  Why I think you're the guy in the mustard yellow jacket.
[7259.89s -> 7260.85s]  Who wears mustard?
[7261.49s -> 7262.70s]  I got my eye on you.
[7263.26s -> 7265.10s]  I got my eye on the mustard jacket.
[7265.74s -> 7268.96s]  Okay Nissy now you said I'm out of here.
[7268.96s -> 7270.72s]  Which means you have to be one of these people.
[7270.72s -> 7272.32s]  Because how would you have known he even walked away?
[7273.42s -> 7275.66s]  Oh oh that's right I just figured you out.
[7276.83s -> 7277.87s]  Thinking about that one.
[7277.87s -> 7280.19s]  You're one of the guys in the mustard colored jacket.
[7281.79s -> 7285.25s]  Okay I don't know which one of them you are.
[7285.25s -> 7286.61s]  But I know or you're the lady.
[7287.17s -> 7288.53s]  All right gray everybody else out.
[7288.53s -> 7290.13s]  I know which one of these guys you are.
[7290.69s -> 7294.88s]  You're that guy.
[7294.88s -> 7296.24s]  You're definitely that guy.
[7298.05s -> 7298.93s]  Say your prayers.
[7301.87s -> 7302.37s]  No!
[7302.37s -> 7303.15s]  You're not good at this.
[7303.15s -> 7303.79s]  He was the lady.
[7303.79s -> 7304.83s]  You were the you were the lady.

[7307.55s -> 7308.05s]  Oh no.
[7309.95s -> 7310.45s]  I had it.
[7311.55s -> 7312.59s]  Did I pick it again?
[7312.59s -> 7313.71s]  You're the fucking monopoly guy again.
[7314.78s -> 7316.54s]  I picked monopoly guy again.
[7316.54s -> 7319.58s]  You're just gonna play with the monopoly guy every single time.
[7320.54s -> 7322.43s]  This is a poker game.
[7322.43s -> 7323.55s]  I'm not gonna give you any tails.
[7323.79s -> 7326.75s]  Ha ha ha yeah that's the major tail.
[7326.75s -> 7328.03s]  Are there 16 different party goers?
[7328.67s -> 7329.15s]  I don't know.
[7329.15s -> 7330.11s]  It looks like there are.
[7331.01s -> 7331.81s]  I'm taking the shot.
[7334.58s -> 7336.58s]  I was the monopoly guy.
[7338.10s -> 7339.22s]  Busted jacket.
[7339.22s -> 7340.02s]  You thought it was busted.
[7342.02s -> 7346.19s]  I should have shot the monopoly guy.
[7346.75s -> 7350.27s]  Yeah you really should have because it would have been like the monopoly guy.
[7350.99s -> 7352.67s]  Like it is every single time.
[7354.08s -> 7356.56s]  You seriously better not pick him again.
[7356.56s -> 7357.76s]  It's not gonna work.
[7357.84s -> 7359.28s]  That is why you titled it that.
[7359.28s -> 7359.92s]  Yeah that's true.
[7361.63s -> 7363.79s]  Hmm this is tricky.
[7364.43s -> 7365.63s]  I don't want to get it wrong.
[7373.28s -> 7374.56s]  I have my suspicions.
[7375.12s -> 7376.16s]  Mustard jacket.
[7376.16s -> 7378.48s]  I'm standing right next to mustard jacket.
[7378.48s -> 7379.52s]  That's a mistake.
[7379.52s -> 7382.00s]  My suspicions are squabbling.
[7382.72s -> 7386.48s]  You don't have very much time.
[7386.48s -> 7387.44s]  I made it real easy.
[7388.40s -> 7389.60s]  You haven't completed your missions.
[7389.60s -> 7390.48s]  There's no way you have.
[7396.43s -> 7399.98s]  Okay okay screw you monopoly guy.
[7399.98s -> 7401.66s]  I don't think it's you but screw you.

[7405.82s -> 7407.90s]  I was moving so obviously to yeah.
[7407.90s -> 7411.90s]  Like I wasn't doing the correct like NPC world of warcraft walk.
[7412.86s -> 7416.22s]  I wasn't doing like the world of warcraft wolf walk.
[7416.22s -> 7417.18s]  Really?
[7417.18s -> 7423.49s]  Yeah someone's already and oh that's not even that can't be you.
[7424.21s -> 7426.42s]  Because that's the double agent as well.
[7426.98s -> 7430.54s]  You can think whatever you want bro.
[7431.42s -> 7433.34s]  Wow he's a wow clicker.
[7433.34s -> 7434.22s]  You want to know what I think?
[7435.10s -> 7435.98s]  What do you think?
[7435.98s -> 7436.54s]  Let's see it.
[7436.54s -> 7438.70s]  I think I think there's a lot of statues here.
[7439.42s -> 7441.18s]  There are a lot of statues here I guess.
[7441.18s -> 7441.98s]  You know what Jerma?
[7442.54s -> 7442.78s]  What?
[7444.03s -> 7445.07s]  Safety is off.
[7445.07s -> 7446.19s]  What do you mean the safety is off?
[7446.75s -> 7447.63s]  Safety is off.
[7448.75s -> 7450.75s]  He's just got it was so it's so nerve-racking.
[7450.75s -> 7451.55s]  Shoot that guy.
[7453.44s -> 7455.12s]  Do it shoot that guy right now.
[7455.12s -> 7458.40s]  He's the next best thing to the monopoly guy.
[7458.40s -> 7459.92s]  Shoot him shoot him right now.
[7459.92s -> 7461.04s]  Shoot that guy right now.
[7461.76s -> 7463.12s]  No shoot him in the head.
[7463.76s -> 7467.41s]  No I'm taking my time.
[7468.53s -> 7471.41s]  Blow that guy's fucking head clean off his shoulders.
[7471.41s -> 7472.77s]  Who's this lady?
[7472.77s -> 7474.93s]  No you pay attention to the other guy.
[7477.17s -> 7478.21s]  That lady didn't do anything.
[7478.21s -> 7479.57s]  That lady's going the other way.
[7479.57s -> 7481.57s]  See he's going this way.
[7482.69s -> 7484.53s]  I did like the voice like it's me.
[7494.24s -> 7495.28s]  I'm just staring at you.
[7495.28s -> 7496.24s]  Why don't you shoot me?
[7501.06s -> 7501.78s]  Does he get this?
[7501.78s -> 7502.82s]  I don't remember.
[7502.82s -> 7503.62s]  Does he get it right?
[7512.50s -> 7516.40s]  No what is about to happen.
[7517.12s -> 7518.08s]  He he does.
[7518.80s -> 7521.36s]  Oh every everything is about to happen.
[7522.98s -> 7524.34s]  No monopoly guy this time.

[7535.22s -> 7535.94s]  I was stretching.
[7537.79s -> 7538.75s]  The stretch.
[7542.02s -> 7549.06s]  You gotta go for it sometimes.
[7549.06s -> 7550.26s]  You gotta go for it.
[7550.26s -> 7552.02s]  You didn't it wasn't the wrong idea.
[7552.02s -> 7554.98s]  No I'm not having this guy show up to no more parties.
[7554.98s -> 7569.57s]  Are you sure it's not him?
[7571.09s -> 7571.89s]  I'm not.
[7573.89s -> 7577.65s]  Okay okay you're picking him this time though.
[7577.65s -> 7578.77s]  I know you can't resist.
[7580.69s -> 7582.61s]  Can we please play around?
[7582.61s -> 7583.11s]  Yes.
[7583.81s -> 7587.81s]  Where you do not instantly kill the monopoly man.
[7590.32s -> 7591.68s]  You could just watch my laser.
[7594.56s -> 7595.20s]  That's fine.
[7596.08s -> 7597.28s]  That's perfectly fine.
[7600.50s -> 7602.66s]  Fucking monopoly man every time.
[7605.22s -> 7606.18s]  He's gonna take the shot.
[7606.18s -> 7606.74s]  I know he is.
[7610.16s -> 7611.76s]  What's he doing just standing over there.
[7614.78s -> 7615.98s]  He's just standing over there.
[7615.98s -> 7617.58s]  He's not doing anything.
[7617.58s -> 7618.54s]  Too suspicious.
[7622.40s -> 7625.68s]  All right I I'm not shooting the monopoly guy.
[7628.38s -> 7629.42s]  I'm not going to shoot.
[7629.42s -> 7630.46s]  Oh it is the fucking monopoly.
[7630.46s -> 7631.66s]  You can tell it's 2012.
[7635.36s -> 7635.86s]  No.
[7637.36s -> 7642.61s]  I tried to shoot.
[7642.61s -> 7643.11s]  Hold on.
[7644.21s -> 7647.38s]  Yeah I tried to shoot the monopoly guy.
[7647.38s -> 7650.66s]  I'm not going to shoot the fucking monopoly guy instantly.
[7653.70s -> 7654.50s]  I would have had it.
[7655.06s -> 7655.86s]  I would have had it.
[7663.81s -> 7665.81s]  You took like a turn too quickly.
[7665.81s -> 7669.73s]  You had one job was to kill the monopoly.
[7674.99s -> 7676.27s]  Oh did you like that video?
[7684.00s -> 7685.20s]  That was a classic one.
[7685.20s -> 7690.54s]  That was a classic one.
[7690.54s -> 7694.96s]  Ah reminiscing of yesteryear.
[7699.10s -> 7700.54s]  Watch my curls video.
[7700.54s -> 7715.46s]  No we already watched that like 50 times.
[7715.46s -> 7716.98s]  Skyrim sliders.
[7719.63s -> 7721.31s]  Oh yeah that is a video isn't it?
[7722.70s -> 7724.30s]  Extreme body sliders.
[7724.94s -> 7727.10s]  I forgot yeah I'll put that one on.
[7727.10s -> 7731.87s]  Let's put that one on.
[7748.74s -> 7750.26s]  Three no three to four.
[7750.26s -> 7750.90s]  Four years ago.
[7752.43s -> 7756.06s]  Just about four years ago this video was made.
[7762.72s -> 7766.56s]  And then we'll yeah then we'll watch like a couple of videos.
[7766.96s -> 7771.22s]  On um maybe like an old star video.
[7776.69s -> 7778.13s]  Death to Spies already did it.
[7778.13s -> 7778.37s]  Did it.
[7778.37s -> 7779.57s]  That was the first one we did.
[7779.57s -> 7788.37s]  Let's get it on.
[7788.37s -> 7791.65s]  So those of you that asked me to play Skyrim.
[7792.29s -> 7793.09s]  This is the video.
[7793.09s -> 7795.33s]  This is the reason why I cannot play it.
[7795.33s -> 7796.21s]  I just can't.
[7808.16s -> 7808.72s]  Hold on.
[7808.72s -> 7809.12s]  Hold on.
[7809.12s -> 7809.92s]  Don't start yet.
[7823.15s -> 7829.44s]  Okay so this is the reason why I cannot play Skyrim.
[7829.44s -> 7832.59s]  Because I did this.
[7832.59s -> 7833.23s]  And away we go.
[7834.03s -> 7846.40s]  My child the task is at hand.
[7847.68s -> 7852.32s]  You must go under cover to stop the human dragon conflict.
[7853.26s -> 7854.46s]  Father I'm not ready.
[7854.46s -> 7855.50s]  Silence.
[7855.50s -> 7856.94s]  You've always been ready.
[7857.66s -> 7859.42s]  You must live among them.
[7860.14s -> 7861.98s]  Be part of the human race.
[7861.98s -> 7864.62s]  Find out what it's like to be human.
[7864.62s -> 7865.82s]  But what if I fail?
[7866.38s -> 7868.46s]  Take the magical cloaking cloak.
[7868.46s -> 7870.94s]  It will always disguise you as a human.
[7870.94s -> 7874.54s]  Our ancestors used dragon wizardry to create the spell.
[7874.54s -> 7876.62s]  It's extremely strong and powerful.
[7876.62s -> 7877.82s]  As long as you wear this.
[7879.10s -> 7881.20s]  Oof that was we went to zero.
[7881.84s -> 7886.24s]  I paused it don't worry.
[7886.96s -> 7895.60s]  All right let's go back to here.
[7895.60s -> 7897.60s]  Take the magical cloaking cloak.
[7897.60s -> 7900.08s]  It will always disguise you as a human.
[7900.08s -> 7903.68s]  Our ancestors used dragon wizardry to create the spell.
[7903.68s -> 7905.76s]  It's extremely strong and powerful.
[7905.76s -> 7908.16s]  As long as you wear this you are safe.
[7909.04s -> 7910.24s]  I love you my son.
[7910.24s -> 7911.28s]  I love you too dad.
[7911.28s -> 7912.00s]  Be careful.
[7912.88s -> 7919.36s]  First day go in meet a few people.
[7920.24s -> 7922.56s]  Good day folks.
[7923.12s -> 7924.08s]  A dragon.
[7924.08s -> 7925.68s]  I saw a dragon.
[7925.68s -> 7926.16s]  What?
[7926.16s -> 7926.96s]  Oh shit.
[7927.60s -> 7928.88s]  Cloak doesn't work.
[7928.88s -> 7931.20s]  Dad a magic cloak.
[7931.20s -> 7933.44s]  Really it was probably just shit faced.
[7934.08s -> 7935.76s]  Please stop hitting me with the sword.
[7936.32s -> 7938.96s]  Please we can live together in harmony.
[7938.96s -> 7939.68s]  Don't you see.
[7940.80s -> 7946.61s]  Maybe a tad on the large side for a head.
[7947.92s -> 7948.72s]  Longer neck.
[7949.36s -> 7951.10s]  We put his head forward a little bit.
[7951.10s -> 7952.14s]  You know he's real perceptive.
[7952.14s -> 7953.02s]  He sniffs around a lot.
[7953.02s -> 7954.46s]  He really really wants to get to the bottom of stuff.
[7954.46s -> 7955.42s]  He's a private investigator.
[7955.98s -> 7956.30s]  What?
[7956.94s -> 7960.86s]  And I think uh I think that's all right.
[7960.86s -> 7961.66s]  I like it.
[7963.66s -> 7964.46s]  A little bigger.
[7964.46s -> 7965.58s]  Yeah that's good.
[7965.58s -> 7966.14s]  That's good.
[7966.14s -> 7967.98s]  We're not going to go any more extreme than this.
[7973.57s -> 7974.85s]  It's a dreams character.
[7976.06s -> 7977.90s]  It's a dreams sculpture.
[7977.90s -> 7978.54s]  Excuse me.
[7980.83s -> 7981.79s]  I just was wondering.
[7984.19s -> 7987.70s]  I can't even see anything.
[7987.70s -> 7992.29s]  It looks like I seriously took this guy's face and molded it out of clay.
[7993.01s -> 7993.57s]  Good old clay.
[7993.57s -> 7995.09s]  This is an art project that I did.
[7995.09s -> 7999.25s]  I found out that I had to do this art project 15 minutes before it was due.
[7999.25s -> 8000.61s]  And it was to make a person's face.
[8002.18s -> 8003.06s]  I can do better than this.
[8007.71s -> 8008.75s]  Dero Pop that's right.
[8017.47s -> 8020.43s]  It's like bullfrog person listening to this guy.
[8021.47s -> 8022.75s]  Sitting on a park bench.
[8024.38s -> 8025.90s]  How can you keep a straight face right there?
[8025.90s -> 8027.50s]  How would you not be scared of this?
[8029.18s -> 8030.14s]  The hamburger guy.
[8034.22s -> 8036.94s]  He like looks over like what the fuck are you doing here?
[8036.94s -> 8037.74s]  You walk away.
[8038.46s -> 8040.62s]  See how big my arms are dude?
[8040.62s -> 8044.46s]  Do you have any idea how big my arms are dude?
[8046.45s -> 8047.73s]  Sometimes you just gotta run.
[8047.73s -> 8048.29s]  You know what I mean?
[8048.29s -> 8051.49s]  Sometimes you're really going to build up that CO2 in your body and breathe it out.
[8051.49s -> 8053.25s]  You just kind of go on a little jog with your hands.
[8053.25s -> 8053.65s]  You know what I'm saying?
[8055.41s -> 8059.38s]  Get up right behind this guy and do our stealthy little secret technique.
[8059.38s -> 8061.06s]  And give him a little small sword.
[8061.06s -> 8061.78s]  Fucking sword.
[8061.78s -> 8062.98s]  Get right in the back with the backstab.
[8065.94s -> 8072.02s]  No I mean this is the little cubert right?
[8072.82s -> 8077.18s]  Who's trying to make cubert?
[8081.66s -> 8083.42s]  The fucking lady's dead man.
[8084.54s -> 8084.94s]  Wow.
[8085.82s -> 8087.30s]  What a sicko.
[8088.10s -> 8089.78s]  I remember being sick for this video.
[8098.18s -> 8100.43s]  I have some bad news honey.
[8100.43s -> 8101.31s]  Yeah I had a cold this week.
[8101.31s -> 8104.03s]  I accidentally backed over the cat this morning.
[8105.07s -> 8107.31s]  It's okay he's still he's in high spirits.
[8107.31s -> 8108.11s]  He's still all right.
[8109.33s -> 8111.17s]  You'll make a fine rug.
[8113.17s -> 8115.33s]  This little cat please leave me alone.
[8117.89s -> 8119.25s]  You old bitch.
[8124.67s -> 8125.87s]  She goes crazy.
[8125.87s -> 8128.27s]  You know I actually thought I was gonna have way more to say about this.
[8129.62s -> 8131.14s]  This is a cat riding a horse.
[8132.50s -> 8135.38s]  I'll see you next year when this is a Disney Pixar movie.
[8137.06s -> 8139.54s]  Back away you foul humans.
[8140.10s -> 8142.42s]  We have every right to go through this tunnel.
[8142.50s -> 8143.54s]  You can't stop us.
[8145.01s -> 8147.17s]  Well you never seen a cat riding a horse before?
[8148.35s -> 8149.15s]  Get cultured.
[8150.67s -> 8153.95s]  Oh shit the fucking Thanksgiving turkey's on the loose.
[8154.91s -> 8156.11s]  This is the best character.
[8157.09s -> 8158.21s]  Hide the women and children.
[8160.62s -> 8163.42s]  The Thanksgiving turkey is the best character I've ever made.
[8163.42s -> 8165.02s]  I'm just gonna run my meat shop.
[8165.58s -> 8167.02s]  I'm doing well for myself.
[8167.58s -> 8171.42s]  I don't have to be concerned that there's an evil Gumby behind me.
[8172.22s -> 8173.18s]  Could be much worse.
[8173.42s -> 8177.90s]  Just don't let them know that you're afraid and everything will be okay.
[8178.94s -> 8185.50s]  So the Thanksgiving turkey is just the gum ball.
[8185.50s -> 8187.58s]  The gum from the fire pro wrestling.
[8187.58s -> 8188.78s]  This is the Dark Souls game.
[8189.98s -> 8193.25s]  What Dark Souls boss did I make?
[8194.05s -> 8195.01s]  Yeah shoot to the arrow.
[8195.01s -> 8196.70s]  Go shoot me right in the penis.
[8196.70s -> 8197.34s]  Good job.
[8198.46s -> 8203.38s]  Hey Jerma play Skyrim.
[8204.18s -> 8205.65s]  Play Skyrim.
[8206.61s -> 8208.30s]  I think you should like Skyrim.
[8208.30s -> 8216.13s]  At some point yeah I kind of can't.
[8216.77s -> 8217.89s]  It'd be such a good stream.
[8217.89s -> 8225.28s]  Yeah that's the thing about like video versus stream video versus stream.
[8225.28s -> 8229.76s]  So that that was like five days worth of just recording stuff and making stuff
[8229.76s -> 8233.04s]  and coming up with things to put on the camera and record it and edit it.
[8233.84s -> 8239.28s]  It's like we do that still but it's like in real time over seven to ten hours.
[8240.00s -> 8243.97s]  So it's it's interesting to see how it plays out like that.
[8245.23s -> 8246.11s]  Who is uglier?
[8251.70s -> 8252.66s]  Who is uglier?
[8252.66s -> 8253.30s]  Saints Row.
[8255.15s -> 8256.43s]  Kung Fu chroma key.
[8261.50s -> 8263.02s]  Ask nicely for crits.
[8263.02s -> 8270.93s]  I haven't seen that in a long time either.
[8270.93s -> 8275.65s]  Come on don't crash on me now internet.
[8275.65s -> 8277.09s]  I haven't seen that in a long time.
[8277.95s -> 8282.30s]  In fact I don't think I've seen that video since it was uploaded.
[8283.94s -> 8284.34s]  Maybe.
[8285.33s -> 8285.97s]  Let's watch it.
[8295.86s -> 8299.94s]  All right let's get this off for a second.
[8302.03s -> 8302.51s]  He's gone.
[8309.57s -> 8311.09s]  Ask nicely for crits.
[8316.16s -> 8317.52s]  This video is long.
[8317.52s -> 8319.60s]  This is like a 12 minute video.
[8320.24s -> 8335.87s]  What even is what's the what's the concept in this video?
[8335.87s -> 8340.29s]  Oh didn't he have to he had to scream right?
[8341.28s -> 8343.92s]  If he didn't scream as loud as he could I wouldn't give it to him.
[8343.92s -> 8359.58s]  Let's get it on.
[8359.58s -> 8360.54s]  Two ads in a row.
[8360.54s -> 8361.50s]  What the fuck YouTube?
[8361.50s -> 8362.46s]  What is this bullshit?
[8363.18s -> 8374.26s]  All right this is this is very much this is a trip down memory lane for sure.
[8374.26s -> 8375.94s]  This is old Team Fortress 2 content.
[8377.86s -> 8379.70s]  I don't know what is going to be in this video.
[8379.70s -> 8382.10s]  All I know is it exists and we're going to watch it.
[8382.10s -> 8384.96s]  It's been a while.
[8384.96s -> 8385.60s]  Here we go.
[8385.60s -> 8387.12s]  Ask nicely for crits.
[8389.76s -> 8394.38s]  All right we're all right we're going to play hide and seek.
[8395.26s -> 8396.06s]  That's how it starts.
[8396.70s -> 8397.74s]  Let's play hide and seek.
[8399.10s -> 8400.91s]  Hide and seek come on.
[8400.91s -> 8401.79s]  Let's play hide and seek.
[8401.79s -> 8405.07s]  Two minutes ago the idea was let's play Team Fortress 2.
[8405.07s -> 8407.71s]  Yeah but don't you want to play hide and seek with me now?
[8407.71s -> 8407.87s]  No.
[8408.51s -> 8411.55s]  Look don't do not turn around because I don't want you to know where I am.
[8412.35s -> 8412.99s]  Understand?
[8412.99s -> 8413.95s]  Yes hide and seek.
[8414.51s -> 8417.23s]  The probably dumbest thing you could ever think of we're doing it.
[8417.23s -> 8420.67s]  This isn't like you know normally people would just go play prop hunt
[8420.67s -> 8422.75s]  but prop hunt's too stupid for you.
[8422.75s -> 8425.15s]  You need you have to take it to the next level of stupid.
[8425.95s -> 8426.99s]  Okay I'm ready.
[8426.99s -> 8427.31s]  Okay.

[8507.52s -> 8508.96s]  And I'm really going to turn this down.
[8517.02s -> 8518.54s]  All right sorry I didn't get a lot of people there.
[8518.54s -> 8520.70s]  I thought there'd be more closer than that.
[8520.70s -> 8521.90s]  What the hell was that?
[8525.25s -> 8526.37s]  It was so loud.
[8526.37s -> 8529.33s]  See he turned I don't do that usually.
[8529.33s -> 8534.93s]  See here's the thing again he turned his timeline volume down to five percent.
[8535.57s -> 8536.69s]  I didn't get five percent.
[8536.69s -> 8538.21s]  I got a hundred percent.
[8538.21s -> 8543.09s]  So that's I did I did snort right there.
[8543.09s -> 8544.85s]  That was like a that was a pig.
[8544.85s -> 8546.45s]  That was like a little piggy.
[8546.45s -> 8549.01s]  He's like he's more closer than that.
[8549.01s -> 8550.29s]  What the hell was that?
[8555.17s -> 8557.57s]  That was uh actually a pig snort.
[8557.57s -> 8559.09s]  That's not a typical one that I do.
[8559.09s -> 8560.61s]  Snorted I don't do that usually.
[8561.89s -> 8562.85s]  You don't do that usually.
[8562.85s -> 8563.81s]  Thanks for clarifying.
[8564.45s -> 8566.13s]  Hey guys guys German doesn't do that usually.
[8567.41s -> 8569.65s]  It's still relevant right now.
[8569.65s -> 8571.33s]  It's not it's not a common thing.
[8571.33s -> 8572.37s]  Yeah I don't do it usually.
[8573.33s -> 8573.73s]  Okay.
[8573.73s -> 8575.01s]  I just said it again.
[8575.01s -> 8576.77s]  Please tell me you're gonna scream again.
[8577.49s -> 8579.25s]  Well how else am I gonna get you to crits me?
[8581.17s -> 8582.77s]  You're gonna have to build it up first.
[8582.77s -> 8584.45s]  Hold on I'm too like busy laughing.
[8585.09s -> 8585.49s]  All right.
[8586.29s -> 8588.34s]  All right so when we build these crits up.
[8588.34s -> 8590.10s]  We need to take we need to take it real careful.
[8591.06s -> 8593.22s]  And his hit sound is me doing something.
[8593.94s -> 8595.22s]  Whoa whoa whoa easy easy easy.
[8595.22s -> 8595.94s]  Hide hide.
[8595.94s -> 8597.22s]  Hide why are we hiding?
[8597.22s -> 8600.18s]  Because there was a guy there that looked like he was going to shoot me.
[8600.18s -> 8601.30s]  I killed him.
[8601.30s -> 8602.10s]  Oh you didn't okay let's go.
[8602.10s -> 8603.70s]  With the power of Kratos.
[8604.34s -> 8610.50s]  With the power of the golden rocket launcher.
[8614.82s -> 8616.34s]  What are you going on about?
[8616.34s -> 8617.62s]  Talking about your golden rocket launcher.
[8617.62s -> 8618.74s]  How it's like a family heirloom.
[8618.74s -> 8620.42s]  I was doing a whole thing there and you just cut me off.
[8620.42s -> 8621.22s]  No no he cut me off.

[8629.31s -> 8630.75s]  I can't I can't all right.
[8630.75s -> 8635.39s]  You are turning into the judge from who framed Roger Rabbit at this point.
[8636.43s -> 8642.43s]  No the worst thing is I heard one of my neighbors coming out of their apartment.
[8642.43s -> 8646.11s]  And they without question a hundred percent certainty they heard me screaming.
[8649.79s -> 8652.03s]  There's not a single doubt in my mind that they heard that.
[8652.03s -> 8653.95s]  I just don't know what their thought process was.
[8653.95s -> 8657.15s]  All right this is also this is also somebody that shit their pants.
[8657.95s -> 8660.43s]  While I was playing Overwatch with them.

[8668.21s -> 8668.85s]  I forget what it was.
[8668.85s -> 8671.78s]  I was streaming it right.
[8671.78s -> 8682.94s]  He pooed his pants and sat in it for like a fucking a long time.
[8690.96s -> 8692.64s]  I still I can't fucking believe that.
[8694.61s -> 8695.89s]  There's videos about that.
[8695.89s -> 8697.89s]  Yeah this dude shit his pants.
[8697.89s -> 8700.77s]  And he didn't want to like fuck up my stream.
[8701.97s -> 8705.17s]  He didn't want to like run away from the stream right.
[8706.67s -> 8709.95s]  So he or with the video or the round.
[8709.95s -> 8711.39s]  It was something like that.
[8711.39s -> 8717.54s]  Yeah we didn't even win the game and he was trying really hard to end it.
[8717.54s -> 8720.66s]  So he could just run away after the round was over.
[8720.66s -> 8725.63s]  Oh what a truce friend.
[8725.63s -> 8728.11s]  Imagine just shit in your pants and you don't care.

[8811.09s -> 8812.13s]  I'm going back.
[8812.13s -> 8813.73s]  If I went back in the past I'd be fine.
[8813.73s -> 8814.69s]  There would be no paradox.
[8814.69s -> 8815.49s]  I'd be perfectly fine.
[8815.49s -> 8817.09s]  I could meet myself and we would have the same.
[8817.09s -> 8818.21s]  We'd say the same fucking thing.

[8836.54s -> 8837.74s]  And then one of us will get captured.
[8837.74s -> 8839.26s]  Will we both get captured?
[8839.26s -> 8842.38s]  Or would only one of us get captured?

[9968.32s -> 9969.36s]  I thought you were trying to kill me.
[9970.16s -> 9970.96s]  I went back.
[9970.96s -> 9972.72s]  I sat down at the computer right now.
[9972.72s -> 9975.44s]  But I thought you were using like telekinetic powers to try to kill me.

[10002.00s -> 10004.16s]  One of his eyes is open and one of them is closed.
[10005.54s -> 10007.38s]  You are deep in thought right now.
[10007.38s -> 10008.42s]  That thing has taken over.
[10008.42s -> 10009.70s]  You've done that too many times.

[10011.78s -> 10013.70s]  Like you've done this so many times.
[10013.70s -> 10015.78s]  You like shouldn't be doing this anymore.

[10026.72s -> 10027.28s]  Oh wait no.
[10027.28s -> 10029.52s]  I have to do one more thing before I head out.
[10029.52s -> 10031.52s]  I just got one more thing I need to do.
[10034.22s -> 10034.62s]  No!
[10034.62s -> 10040.90s]  What is going on?
[10040.90s -> 10042.66s]  This game is fucking so much fun.
[10042.66s -> 10043.78s]  He's beef raving.
[10043.78s -> 10044.50s]  Organ playing.
[10046.59s -> 10047.47s]  Don't look over here.
[10050.03s -> 10054.35s]  Whatever you do for like the next minute do not look over here.
[10055.23s -> 10059.55s]  Did you just make a unit that is playing an organ of death?
[10060.93s -> 10061.25s]  Nah.
[10064.08s -> 10068.56s]  You can turn around in 10 seconds and like notice that there's a monster behind you.
[10068.56s -> 10069.44s]  Really?
[10069.44s -> 10069.68s]  Yeah.

[10076.14s -> 10076.70s]  Turn now.
[10082.08s -> 10083.36s]  You can't stop me.
[10084.16s -> 10085.04s]  He thinks he's so big.
[10085.04s -> 10086.64s]  He thinks he's so goddamn strong.
[10086.64s -> 10090.24s]  Do you think he's strong enough to take on the march of the C-3PO's?
[10090.24s -> 10090.96s]  I doubt it.
[10092.56s -> 10093.28s]  Oh shit.
[10094.24s -> 10099.30s]  Oh we both get them don't we?
[10100.02s -> 10101.31s]  I think we both get them.

[10108.46s -> 10110.86s]  Yeah we built some hinges on our warehouse.
[10113.18s -> 10114.94s]  Hey what are you doing over there?
[10115.50s -> 10116.06s]  Nothing much.
[10116.70s -> 10118.40s]  I'm just coming over here to kill you.

[10130.02s -> 10130.74s]  What is this wind?
[10131.38s -> 10134.82s]  What a waste of 500 billion dollars.
[10135.54s -> 10138.83s]  My grandfather told me this is the button.
[10138.83s -> 10139.87s]  My grandfather.
[10139.87s -> 10141.39s]  When you know you've been defeated.
[10141.95s -> 10143.49s]  The final stand.
[10144.66s -> 10145.22s]  Activate it.
[10146.53s -> 10147.09s]  Let him come.
[10152.16s -> 10153.68s]  They killed themselves.
[10156.83s -> 10157.71s]  What is this guy?
[10159.01s -> 10162.85s]  Oh yeah you can breach the other person's base with units.
[10162.85s -> 10163.35s]  I didn't.
[10165.01s -> 10165.57s]  I won.
[10166.53s -> 10168.53s]  Well how did you get out there?
[10169.25s -> 10170.13s]  Help.
[10170.13s -> 10172.13s]  What do you I don't understand how you did this.
[10172.13s -> 10172.69s]  Let me in.
[10173.57s -> 10174.53s]  Oh I'm gonna let you in.
[10174.53s -> 10175.33s]  Just be careful.
[10176.05s -> 10178.26s]  How did you get stuck out there?
[10180.26s -> 10182.43s]  He wanted to discuss something.
[10184.22s -> 10187.04s]  Yeah what did you want to discuss?
[10187.04s -> 10190.32s]  We're a military compound not too far away.
[10190.32s -> 10192.40s]  You've been yeah you know.
[10193.52s -> 10196.66s]  Didn't even want to come up with anything.
[10197.30s -> 10198.48s]  What did I do again?
[10199.44s -> 10202.27s]  You gave up halfway through.
[10202.27s -> 10204.11s]  You know what it doesn't matter.
[10204.11s -> 10205.55s]  We were playing for two hours.
[10205.55s -> 10206.75s]  Two fucking hours of this.
[10206.75s -> 10208.03s]  What the hell have we been doing?
[10211.12s -> 10211.76s]  It's true.
[10212.48s -> 10215.20s]  It's true we didn't even play the game.
[10220.61s -> 10221.89s]  We had a tendency to do that though.
[10222.69s -> 10226.05s]  We would just not do anything for like three hours.
[10226.05s -> 10228.77s]  And then be like you know what that was kind of fun.
[10228.77s -> 10230.21s]  I think that would be a pretty good video.
[10237.04s -> 10237.68s]  Damnation.
[10239.28s -> 10241.04s]  I think yeah Damnation is a good one to do too.
[10241.60s -> 10246.94s]  So we'll do we'll do Damnation.
[10248.38s -> 10257.46s]  We'll do Damnation Dying Light.
[10257.46s -> 10259.78s]  And then we'll see where we are from there.
[10259.78s -> 10263.68s]  Let's do Damnation.
[10274.46s -> 10275.58s]  Oh I remember this one.
[10276.14s -> 10277.74s]  This is the Pop Tarts thing.
[10282.08s -> 10283.20s]  I remember this one.
[10285.23s -> 10289.71s]  This is actually this is the video where Star laughed harder than anything he's ever done.
[10290.35s -> 10291.71s]  For my what I remember.
[10291.71s -> 10296.96s]  He almost threw up laughing at like the stupid motorcycle I think right.
[10296.96s -> 10300.14s]  I believe this is that video.
[10302.74s -> 10305.78s]  I've never heard him laugh as hard as he did here.
[10306.74s -> 10308.58s]  No I've never heard him go harder than this.
[10309.22s -> 10311.01s]  All right here we go.

[10342.24s -> 10342.80s]  What does that mean?
[10344.30s -> 10345.66s]  It's not blood or gore.
[10345.66s -> 10347.90s]  Usually they the blood or gore is a checkbox.
[10347.90s -> 10349.42s]  Watch first scene of this game.
[10349.42s -> 10350.70s]  There's just gonna be tits everywhere.
[10354.85s -> 10356.13s]  What's I asked you a question.
[10357.09s -> 10357.57s]  I don't know.
[10357.57s -> 10360.06s]  I know she told me.
[10360.06s -> 10360.54s]  Rourke.
[10360.54s -> 10361.02s]  Joaquin.
[10361.90s -> 10362.54s]  Joaquin.
[10363.58s -> 10364.06s]  Rourke.
[10365.66s -> 10367.66s]  That's the that's this person's name Joaquin.
[10368.46s -> 10370.06s]  That's something that like.
[10370.06s -> 10370.86s]  I want to move this way.
[10370.86s -> 10372.06s]  I'm not able to separate.
[10373.18s -> 10374.46s]  Oh well I want to move this way.
[10374.46s -> 10375.66s]  It's more comfortable in this seat.
[10377.26s -> 10377.90s]  Yeah that's better.
[10378.54s -> 10380.16s]  It's more comfy this way.
[10382.03s -> 10385.71s]  Now I got like a good I can like sit over here and your chats over here too.
[10389.95s -> 10392.19s]  So I got chat and I got the video.

[10404.83s -> 10407.84s]  Nice rat tail whatever.
[10408.88s -> 10411.14s]  That's the that's this person's name Joaquin.
[10411.86s -> 10414.82s]  That's something that like Chung Li would scream when she shoots a fireball.
[10414.82s -> 10415.78s]  I'm able to separate.
[10415.78s -> 10416.50s]  Joaquin.
[10417.46s -> 10418.18s]  Joaquin.
[10418.18s -> 10419.94s]  Many of this old boy's basic controls.
[10422.13s -> 10423.17s]  Holy shit.
[10424.13s -> 10427.62s]  This is so loud.
[10428.34s -> 10428.90s]  Loud.
[10428.90s -> 10430.82s]  This is the loudest thing I've ever experienced.
[10430.82s -> 10431.86s]  Let you come alone.
[10431.86s -> 10432.98s]  Joaquin.
[10432.98s -> 10433.62s]  Joaquin.
[10437.70s -> 10441.98s]  I hear that in my dreams.
[10441.98s -> 10444.22s]  Does it seriously have to be this loud?
[10449.49s -> 10450.69s]  I told you he was gonna die.
[10450.69s -> 10451.33s]  Ten bucks.
[10454.21s -> 10456.29s]  Is he gonna get run over by a motorcycle too?
[10456.29s -> 10457.49s]  That's been the best.
[10457.49s -> 10457.89s]  What?
[10457.89s -> 10458.85s]  What an awful shot.
[10459.41s -> 10460.53s]  And you're not shooting him.
[10460.53s -> 10461.57s]  How was you missing that?
[10461.57s -> 10463.17s]  How did you miss those three shots?
[10463.17s -> 10464.37s]  I could do that.
[10464.37s -> 10465.17s]  Shoot him.
[10465.17s -> 10465.65s]  Shoot him.
[10466.21s -> 10467.65s]  He's already gone.
[10470.13s -> 10470.53s]  Star.
[10471.17s -> 10471.87s]  Yes.
[10471.87s -> 10474.59s]  I didn't want to be the first one to say this but I truly think
[10475.55s -> 10479.31s]  I truly think this weird agency is poisoning the water supply.
[10480.11s -> 10480.83s]  Oh no.
[10483.10s -> 10484.14s]  Where is he?

[10534.56s -> 10536.08s]  Toaster strudel.
[10536.08s -> 10537.36s]  Toaster strudel.
[10537.36s -> 10540.40s]  I got it in.
[10541.55s -> 10542.83s]  Off of Moria.
[10542.83s -> 10544.27s]  I remember this shit.
[10544.27s -> 10544.99s]  Don't we drive it back?
[10544.99s -> 10546.35s]  All right, I got it in.
[10546.35s -> 10547.15s]  I got it in the house.
[10551.47s -> 10552.67s]  I don't know what to do.
[10552.67s -> 10553.39s]  I don't.
[10553.39s -> 10554.03s]  I'm stuck.
[10556.03s -> 10557.87s]  Well, get off.
[10562.85s -> 10564.69s]  Get off of it so we can do this joke.
[10565.49s -> 10566.69s]  I kind of can't do it.
[10570.13s -> 10570.91s]  I can't.
[10570.91s -> 10571.71s]  Didn't you?
[10571.71s -> 10572.51s]  Yeah, I did from this.
[10573.79s -> 10576.35s]  Once we start to actually drive it on the road.
[10576.35s -> 10577.31s]  All right, I'm gonna get off.
[10577.31s -> 10578.27s]  I almost passed out.
[10578.27s -> 10581.50s]  You got this on the second floor?
[10581.50s -> 10583.90s]  Honey, I have your favorite breakfast food.
[10583.90s -> 10584.54s]  Pop-Tart.
[10588.72s -> 10591.12s]  Yeah, that was so cool.
[10591.12s -> 10592.88s]  This is lagging so bad.
[10592.88s -> 10593.36s]  This is it.
[10598.58s -> 10600.34s]  This game just got so much better.
[10603.78s -> 10605.30s]  You can't take that.
[10605.30s -> 10609.22s]  You cannot drive like that.
[10609.86s -> 10610.90s]  The walls.
[10610.90s -> 10612.02s]  Riding on the walls.
[10612.02s -> 10612.66s]  Look at that.
[10615.30s -> 10616.66s]  That's fucking sick.
[10617.54s -> 10618.10s]  Listen to him.
[10627.79s -> 10628.67s]  No, don't go.
[10631.15s -> 10631.63s]  I'm dead.
[10637.87s -> 10639.23s]  I thought I died.
[10639.23s -> 10639.95s]  I was dead.
[10640.99s -> 10644.27s]  I was like, I'm like gonna burga please throw up right now.
[10647.23s -> 10648.75s]  Why would you be able to do that?
[10655.95s -> 10657.39s]  Oh my god.
[10657.39s -> 10658.11s]  Listen to him.
[10658.11s -> 10660.03s]  Yeah, he's fucking going nuts.
[10660.99s -> 10663.07s]  What is extreme content?
[10663.07s -> 10663.87s]  What does that mean?
[10664.51s -> 10668.62s]  This was such a boring game.
[10668.62s -> 10670.38s]  And then they added this to it.
[10674.30s -> 10675.42s]  Oh, you're in another room.
[10676.62s -> 10678.06s]  Watch out for this guy.
[10678.06s -> 10678.70s]  I'm gonna die.
[10680.70s -> 10682.30s]  No, what?
[10683.10s -> 10683.98s]  I think you ran me over.
[10683.98s -> 10684.46s]  I'm dead.
[10687.60s -> 10688.08s]  All right.
[10688.08s -> 10689.92s]  Here's your last chance, honey.
[10689.92s -> 10691.44s]  They're nice and piping hot.
[10691.44s -> 10692.64s]  Pop-Tart.
[10692.64s -> 10694.16s]  Please give me the Pop-Tart.
[10694.16s -> 10694.88s]  Yes.
[10694.88s -> 10695.44s]  Oh, fuck.
[10699.30s -> 10699.86s]  We got it.
[10705.28s -> 10707.66s]  Oh, he spawns in the room, right?
[10708.38s -> 10711.26s]  I'm gonna use my superpowers to see where he is.
[10712.30s -> 10715.49s]  I'm not climbing up.
[10716.21s -> 10720.51s]  This is like on all those movies you watch with like the
[10720.51s -> 10723.23s]  Oh, the school bus is just hanging by a thread.
[10723.23s -> 10724.11s]  How much it's going.
[10724.83s -> 10728.00s]  I'm stuck perfectly.
[10728.00s -> 10729.28s]  Like I have no traction.
[10729.28s -> 10730.16s]  You cannot move at all?
[10734.21s -> 10734.85s]  No.
[10734.85s -> 10736.90s]  You cannot move this at all.
[10736.90s -> 10737.70s]  He just fly off?
[10740.58s -> 10741.62s]  Oh, yeah.
[10741.62s -> 10742.74s]  Sure, you can't.
[10743.94s -> 10744.58s]  No, no.
[10744.58s -> 10746.98s]  Hitting the jet booster on the back kind of help.
[10747.78s -> 10748.10s]  All right.
[10748.10s -> 10748.58s]  I'm done.
[10748.58s -> 10749.78s]  I'm out of this fucking game.
[10749.78s -> 10759.22s]  Chalk it up for games that you kind of wish that you played more of.
[10760.18s -> 10765.33s]  You kind of wish that you played that way more than you actually did.
[10769.22s -> 10771.14s]  But someone was asking why are we doing this?
[10771.14s -> 10771.78s]  Why are we doing?
[10771.78s -> 10772.34s]  Wait, where are you?
[10772.34s -> 10772.74s]  You're over here.
[10773.54s -> 10774.74s]  What camera are we looking at right now?
[10776.94s -> 10781.34s]  Because I have dropped just about 100,000 frames.
[10782.45s -> 10784.85s]  So I couldn't really do anything.
[10784.85s -> 10785.97s]  So we're just handing it out.
[10785.97s -> 10787.97s]  Figured we'd just watch some videos for a few hours.
[10792.18s -> 10793.14s]  It's bad.
[10793.14s -> 10793.62s]  It's bad.
[10794.18s -> 10796.30s]  But let's watch Dying Light.
[10800.85s -> 10805.25s]  Yeah, I think I actually have to go from here.
[10805.25s -> 10807.28s]  This is fun.
[10807.28s -> 10808.64s]  Yeah, I'm glad we got it.
[10808.64s -> 10810.24s]  I'm glad I didn't just like turn it off.
[10810.80s -> 10814.82s]  I'm glad we got to at least stream for three, four plus hours here.
[10815.38s -> 10819.74s]  So let's watch the Dying Light video.
[10819.74s -> 10827.14s]  I mean, we salvaged the stream.
[10827.14s -> 10827.94s]  It was salvaged.
[10827.94s -> 10828.98s]  If we can at least hang out.
[10833.44s -> 10834.40s]  Dying Light.
[10835.04s -> 10840.75s]  Is that, I think it's the star.
[10840.75s -> 10841.79s]  It's a star video, right?
[10842.51s -> 10843.71s]  No, we both made one of these.
[10846.80s -> 10847.52s]  It, oh, okay.
[10847.52s -> 10848.40s]  So I have one too.
[10848.96s -> 10851.60s]  This is Legend of the Tunnel Troll.
[10864.32s -> 10865.60s]  They're both good.
[10865.60s -> 10869.78s]  Let me get this on here.
[10872.85s -> 10874.93s]  Legend of the Tunnel Troll.
[10879.36s -> 10880.80s]  That, oh, the, the tunnel.
[10880.80s -> 10882.32s]  Here, here's another one of those.
[10882.32s -> 10884.16s]  We tried to do something over and over again.
[10884.16s -> 10884.88s]  It just doesn't work.
[10886.99s -> 10888.27s]  We did that quite often.
[10888.27s -> 10889.71s]  We tried, many times.
[10890.35s -> 10895.78s]  And sometimes you guys are only seeing like 20% of the attempts.
[10895.78s -> 10911.20s]  Okay, let's get that out of the way.
[10911.92s -> 10913.89s]  And let's get that back on the screen.
[10915.33s -> 10916.61s]  I'll get back on screen too.
[10916.61s -> 10916.93s]  Why not?
[10916.93s -> 10917.73s]  Here we go.
[10917.73s -> 10919.17s]  One, two, three.
[10920.53s -> 10928.35s]  Okay, so that's what that does.
[10929.15s -> 10930.35s]  Its head came off.
[10930.35s -> 10932.80s]  Yeah, interesting.
[10932.80s -> 10933.68s]  Okay, interesting.
[10935.38s -> 10937.14s]  Sir, you appear to be on fire.
[10941.36s -> 10941.84s]  Just dead.
[10943.76s -> 10944.08s]  What?
[10944.80s -> 10945.44s]  Why?
[10945.44s -> 10947.36s]  I thought I had more health than that.
[10947.36s -> 10948.72s]  You just instant died.
[10951.86s -> 10952.90s]  That fake laugh.
[10952.90s -> 10954.58s]  Funny, funny, funny, funny.
[10962.78s -> 10973.68s]  Skip, skip, skip.
[10975.92s -> 10976.80s]  It's going in my video.
[10978.80s -> 10979.84s]  It's going in my video.
[10979.84s -> 10980.32s]  Yes, it is.
[10982.32s -> 10983.84s]  What's your response to what you just did?
[10985.76s -> 10986.32s]  Very quickly.
[10986.32s -> 10988.24s]  Well, I want to hear like, what's your response.
[10988.24s -> 10989.12s]  I'm bored.
[10991.44s -> 10995.65s]  Here's another funny tidbit for you.
[10996.77s -> 10999.33s]  We used to be recorded saying all kinds of fucking weird shit.
[10999.89s -> 11001.41s]  And it would always be that.
[11001.41s -> 11003.81s]  You would always be like, no, no, no, dude, don't put that in your video.
[11005.12s -> 11008.54s]  And it would be fun sometimes to put it in anyways.
[11011.22s -> 11012.82s]  Like, don't, dude, don't put that in.
[11012.82s -> 11014.50s]  That's not something you should put in the video.
[11015.22s -> 11016.50s]  No, dude, I'm gonna.
[11016.50s -> 11017.54s]  No, don't, don't, don't.
[11017.54s -> 11019.94s]  Dude, like, what about my reputation?
[11019.94s -> 11027.79s]  And sometimes you just put it in.
[11027.79s -> 11031.17s]  Sometimes you just put it in.
[11031.17s -> 11031.81s]  Got my gun.
[11032.37s -> 11035.07s]  Oh, what do you guys got?
[11035.07s -> 11036.27s]  What's going on over here, boys?
[11038.19s -> 11038.83s]  Put your hands up.
[11040.11s -> 11041.31s]  Put your fucking hands up.
[11041.31s -> 11042.03s]  Hands in the air.
[11043.57s -> 11043.97s]  Yeah.
[11043.97s -> 11044.45s]  Oh, yeah.
[11044.45s -> 11054.54s]  Doesn't need to fucking ruin that guy.
[11060.91s -> 11061.79s]  I destroyed it.
[11061.79s -> 11062.59s]  That was like.
[11062.59s -> 11063.07s]  Psycho.
[11063.79s -> 11065.07s]  I wasn't the psycho.
[11065.07s -> 11065.71s]  I didn't do it.
[11065.71s -> 11068.11s]  The guy threw a fucking axe in his head.
[11069.57s -> 11071.01s]  And he looks left and right.
[11071.01s -> 11072.45s]  Like, what the fuck do I do now?
[11073.49s -> 11074.77s]  Yeah, he was like, still.
[11074.77s -> 11075.33s]  All right.
[11075.33s -> 11077.17s]  This game was so fucked.
[11077.17s -> 11079.25s]  It was just so all over the place.
[11079.25s -> 11080.13s]  Like two seconds.
[11080.13s -> 11082.05s]  He was just like, oh, shit.
[11082.05s -> 11082.37s]  Okay.
[11082.37s -> 11083.17s]  There's an action.
[11083.25s -> 11084.45s]  My fucking head.
[11084.45s -> 11085.17s]  What am I doing?
[11085.17s -> 11086.37s]  Do I run away?
[11086.37s -> 11088.13s]  Got real dark, real quick.
[11088.13s -> 11089.73s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[11089.73s -> 11090.37s]  No.
[11090.37s -> 11090.61s]  Somewhere.
[11090.61s -> 11091.65s]  Can I eat these trees?
[11091.65s -> 11092.21s]  No.
[11092.21s -> 11092.69s]  I don't know.
[11092.69s -> 11094.85s]  I really just don't know anything about where I am right now.
[11095.41s -> 11097.09s]  Who goes there?
[11097.09s -> 11099.65s]  This is the tunnel and I am its troll.
[11099.65s -> 11100.37s]  What do you want?
[11101.01s -> 11103.73s]  I just was looking for some food, looking for some supplies.
[11103.73s -> 11104.85s]  I just wanted to find something.
[11104.85s -> 11107.09s]  When I come in, I have food and supplies.
[11107.09s -> 11107.97s]  I have both of those.
[11107.97s -> 11108.93s]  I have a lot of them.
[11108.93s -> 11109.89s]  Is this some kind of trick?
[11110.69s -> 11111.97s]  No, I'm not a troll.
[11112.85s -> 11113.49s]  All right.
[11113.49s -> 11114.29s]  I believe you.
[11114.29s -> 11114.93s]  Come in.
[11114.93s -> 11115.73s]  Come in.
[11115.73s -> 11116.61s]  What do you got back here?
[11116.61s -> 11117.01s]  Do you have any?
[11117.01s -> 11117.57s]  I got this.
[11118.69s -> 11119.17s]  What happened?
[11120.53s -> 11122.53s]  Just you wait 30 or 40 seconds.
[11122.53s -> 11124.13s]  Something real bad is coming.
[11124.13s -> 11125.01s]  Didn't work.
[11125.01s -> 11125.73s]  You got to do it again.
[11126.45s -> 11127.89s]  Can I eat these trees?
[11127.89s -> 11129.89s]  Maybe I can chew on the bark and get some syrup.
[11129.89s -> 11130.61s]  I really don't know.
[11130.61s -> 11131.33s]  I'm just...
[11131.33s -> 11132.29s]  What is that?
[11132.29s -> 11133.73s]  Who goes there?
[11133.73s -> 11136.05s]  Who tries to enter the tunnel of the troll?
[11136.05s -> 11136.37s]  Not me.
[11136.37s -> 11138.85s]  I was just looking for some supplies and maybe some food to eat.
[11139.65s -> 11142.45s]  Well, hey, I have supplies and food all back here.
[11142.45s -> 11143.41s]  If you just want to come in the tunnel for a second.
[11143.41s -> 11144.13s]  Some kind of trick?
[11145.57s -> 11146.61s]  No, I'm not a troll.
[11146.61s -> 11147.25s]  Oh, okay.
[11147.25s -> 11147.97s]  I believe you.
[11147.97s -> 11148.61s]  Just come in.
[11148.61s -> 11149.33s]  It'll be everything.
[11149.33s -> 11150.05s]  I really hope you have...
[11151.17s -> 11152.37s]  I hope you have pizza rolls.
[11153.25s -> 11153.57s]  What's this?
[11153.57s -> 11154.29s]  What have you done to me?
[11154.77s -> 11155.33s]  What have you done?
[11155.97s -> 11158.85s]  I just wait like 30 to 40 seconds microwave.
[11158.85s -> 11159.41s]  What are you talking about?
[11159.41s -> 11161.17s]  What am I waiting 30 or 40 seconds?
[11161.97s -> 11167.10s]  This joke is so bad.
[11167.10s -> 11167.82s]  It is.
[11167.82s -> 11168.62s]  It really is.
[11168.62s -> 11169.90s]  This is not like this.
[11169.90s -> 11174.22s]  This is worse than the fucking jump through the glass Pop-Tart joke.
[11174.22s -> 11175.18s]  Oh, call back.
[11175.18s -> 11176.14s]  That was a call back.
[11186.30s -> 11193.74s]  Why can't we not get the fuck off this stupid troll joke?
[11195.98s -> 11197.10s]  I'm dropping out.
[11197.10s -> 11198.30s]  We have to stop this now.
[11201.49s -> 11202.61s]  Hey, it's me.
[11204.53s -> 11206.53s]  Stock scream.
[11206.53s -> 11208.61s]  That did sound like a stock scream.
[11209.33s -> 11211.25s]  That was a stock scream.
[11211.25s -> 11211.97s]  Fucking hate troll.
[11218.14s -> 11219.42s]  I'll get this troll secret.
[11219.42s -> 11220.30s]  They're my secret.
[11220.30s -> 11221.02s]  Get away from me.
[11221.02s -> 11221.58s]  Get away from me.
[11221.58s -> 11222.38s]  I'm sick of it.
[11222.38s -> 11223.02s]  I have to troll.
[11223.02s -> 11225.18s]  I have to fucking hate troll.
[11229.49s -> 11230.37s]  I can't, man.
[11231.33s -> 11233.25s]  Oh my fucking god.
[11233.25s -> 11234.05s]  Stupid troll joke.
[11236.29s -> 11237.41s]  I'm dropping out.
[11237.49s -> 11238.69s]  We have to stop this now.
[11241.87s -> 11243.07s]  Hey, it's me.
[11243.07s -> 11244.27s]  Made it onto one of the towers.
[11245.63s -> 11248.61s]  You know we're both jumping off, right?
[11251.57s -> 11252.61s]  Edit that part out.
[11252.61s -> 11253.97s]  There's a fucking zombie up here.
[11256.10s -> 11256.82s]  Hold on.
[11256.82s -> 11258.34s]  Don't do anything to him.
[11258.34s -> 11259.94s]  How would you have ever made it up here?
[11259.94s -> 11261.22s]  She doesn't even have a arm.
[11261.94s -> 11263.63s]  This zombie is armed.
[11263.63s -> 11265.07s]  One armed climbed up here.
[11265.07s -> 11266.27s]  Are you telling me that's what happened?
[11267.55s -> 11268.51s]  No way.
[11269.31s -> 11278.62s]  What if she got up and just fly back up?
[11278.62s -> 11279.66s]  That's where this came from.
[11279.66s -> 11280.70s]  That is where this came from.
[11281.50s -> 11281.98s]  Hurry.
[11281.98s -> 11282.30s]  Quickly.
[11282.30s -> 11282.78s]  Quickly.
[11282.78s -> 11283.26s]  Hurry.
[11283.26s -> 11283.76s]  Whoa.
[11284.94s -> 11290.38s]  It's a spitter.
[11291.82s -> 11293.02s]  That cut scene just healed me.
[11293.58s -> 11295.90s]  I'm shouting because this fucked up infected motherfucker
[11295.90s -> 11299.10s]  with guts hanging out of his mouth just spit a bunch of toxic snot at me.
[11300.70s -> 11301.50s]  Motherfucker.
[11302.54s -> 11305.50s]  Toxic motherfucker was fucking snot in his mouth.
[11305.50s -> 11306.22s]  Turn your light off.
[11306.38s -> 11306.88s]  Uh.
[11309.28s -> 11311.04s]  Oh look there's like a door here.
[11311.04s -> 11312.64s]  Oh whoa I thought it was real.
[11315.04s -> 11318.72s]  All right I want you to go through my time travel machine
[11318.72s -> 11324.32s]  as you see here my lovely assistant head on through and I'll see you in a year 1900.
[11328.46s -> 11329.98s]  That's not as funny as I thought it was gonna be.
[11336.19s -> 11337.23s]  What the fuck?
[11338.11s -> 11339.79s]  Hey it's okay.
[11339.79s -> 11341.15s]  Are you all right sir?
[11341.15s -> 11343.87s]  Hey you just dropped like 10,000 feet.
[11344.75s -> 11345.47s]  Forgot that happened.
[11345.47s -> 11346.51s]  Hey what were we doing earlier?
[11346.51s -> 11348.83s]  Let's say go let's go go let's do parkour and jump.
[11351.42s -> 11352.46s]  Oh what are you doing?
[11358.66s -> 11361.92s]  This is such a fun multiplayer game it really was.
[11361.92s -> 11362.96s]  I'm pushing the boat.
[11362.96s -> 11364.24s]  No what is he doing?
[11368.16s -> 11369.68s]  You don't know what it looks like for you guys.
[11373.04s -> 11374.48s]  I just want to ride the boat.
[11375.12s -> 11376.00s]  I just want to go.
[11376.96s -> 11383.12s]  That's like somebody just learned unity and this is what they're they didn't animate anything.
[11384.16s -> 11386.56s]  They just learned how to like rig somebody in unity.
[11386.56s -> 11386.96s]  I got it.
[11386.96s -> 11387.44s]  He got it.
[11389.38s -> 11389.94s]  Got it.
[11389.94s -> 11390.34s]  Got it.
[11391.71s -> 11392.11s]  I got it.
[11392.11s -> 11392.59s]  He got it.
[11393.15s -> 11393.79s]  All right my turn.
[11395.55s -> 11396.99s]  How did you even attempt to do that?
[11396.99s -> 11398.19s]  I have no idea how you even tried.
[11398.19s -> 11401.55s]  There's a place you can stand where it's like completely it's really really easy to do.
[11401.55s -> 11405.31s]  All right what if I like start to if I start to fall and can I grab it maybe?
[11405.31s -> 11406.59s]  Oh I remember this.
[11406.59s -> 11408.51s]  No I wouldn't do it that way.
[11408.51s -> 11409.07s]  Going for it.
[11410.03s -> 11411.55s]  Look what I just did.
[11411.55s -> 11414.35s]  You want to talk about like falling and grabbing onto something?
[11415.47s -> 11417.15s]  Wow Jermis is the master of falling and grabbing onto things.
[11417.15s -> 11418.03s]  I'm fucking the man.
[11422.56s -> 11423.76s]  Back to square one.
[11423.76s -> 11424.96s]  Everyone I want all the actors.
[11426.64s -> 11428.64s]  No shit no dude.
[11428.64s -> 11431.20s]  Hey just wait just wait like 30 seconds.
[11431.20s -> 11432.88s]  Yeah guess what I'm they're gonna.
[11434.00s -> 11434.72s]  Come on.
[11434.72s -> 11436.64s]  No get the fuck out of here.
[11437.60s -> 11447.54s]  Oh god damn it.
[11463.10s -> 11464.54s]  We have to watch the other one.
[11465.58s -> 11467.02s]  We're gonna watch the other one.
[11467.02s -> 11468.54s]  We're gonna watch Star's video.
[11469.74s -> 11470.94s]  Here's the thing that this is the thing.
[11472.78s -> 11474.70s]  Star and I when we played the same game.
[11475.34s -> 11477.66s]  Some more little youtuber lore for you.
[11478.30s -> 11480.96s]  We never made the same video.
[11480.96s -> 11484.80s]  We always made it a point to make completely different videos.
[11484.88s -> 11486.40s]  Because we didn't want it to just be.
[11486.40s -> 11488.80s]  Oh here's the same video from another perspective.
[11488.80s -> 11491.60s]  We wanted to always have completely different videos.
[11492.94s -> 11499.54s]  And it would sometimes would cause lighthearted arguments.
[11499.54s -> 11503.60s]  Because we would get into these little.
[11503.60s -> 11504.96s]  Oh that was really good.
[11504.96s -> 11506.24s]  That was a really fun clip.
[11506.24s -> 11507.68s]  Who's getting that one?
[11507.68s -> 11510.11s]  I'd be like oh well you got like.
[11511.31s -> 11514.19s]  You got the guy like the car flipping and crushing the guy's head.
[11514.19s -> 11515.23s]  Yeah but I like the.
[11515.23s -> 11516.59s]  I think I should have that one.
[11516.67s -> 11517.31s]  I should have that clip.
[11517.31s -> 11519.30s]  That should be my clip.
[11519.30s -> 11522.35s]  That's where like need a clip or need a clip.
[11522.35s -> 11524.91s]  We would talk about what.
[11524.91s -> 11529.82s]  Who was going to have what and what in their video.
[11529.82s -> 11532.78s]  And sometimes I remember specifically watching a video of his.
[11532.78s -> 11534.70s]  And there was like a clip that I thought was really good.
[11534.70s -> 11537.82s]  And I was like damn I really wanted that one.
[11538.54s -> 11539.82s]  And he did the same thing though.
[11539.82s -> 11540.86s]  He did the same thing.
[11540.86s -> 11542.54s]  He'd watch videos of mine and be like.
[11542.54s -> 11545.10s]  Oh that was like that's better from my perspective.
[11545.10s -> 11545.82s]  It should have been mine.
[11546.90s -> 11549.58s]  So but it turned out pretty good.
[11549.58s -> 11554.02s]  Because you never watched a video twice.
[11554.02s -> 11555.22s]  From just a different camera angle.
[11555.22s -> 11556.26s]  It was always a different video.
[11557.41s -> 11559.09s]  So let's case in point.
[11559.09s -> 11560.53s]  Let's watch it right now and you'll see.
[11565.04s -> 11568.16s]  I think we would share like maybe like sometimes it'd be.
[11568.16s -> 11570.40s]  If there was something really really funny from another perspective.
[11572.80s -> 11574.16s]  Typically it would be different though.
[11574.16s -> 11581.84s]  Very different.
[11581.84s -> 11584.08s]  His video is titled Zombie Jackass.
[11586.58s -> 11590.00s]  Tubers that care.
[11590.00s -> 11591.60s]  Well I honestly I just.
[11592.67s -> 11595.38s]  I just didn't want and neither did he.
[11596.75s -> 11599.07s]  It and this is obviously I don't want to.
[11599.63s -> 11604.59s]  You know throw unnecessary shade at.
[11604.59s -> 11620.30s]  Hold on it's talking to me in my ear.
[11620.30s -> 11622.30s]  It froze on me again.
[11625.02s -> 11626.54s]  But what I was saying is it.
[11626.54s -> 11629.86s]  Typically what you'd have you know.
[11629.86s -> 11632.90s]  Let's say let's say two or three people are recording together right.
[11633.78s -> 11636.58s]  And then they all upload the same exact footage.
[11636.58s -> 11638.26s]  It's just from a different angle.
[11638.26s -> 11640.34s]  And sometimes it wouldn't even be from a different angle.
[11640.34s -> 11643.78s]  Sometimes it'd be a game that was not a separate angle.
[11643.78s -> 11648.86s]  It was just here's the video three more times.
[11648.86s -> 11652.06s]  We just came to a conclusion together.
[11652.06s -> 11654.54s]  That it was we didn't really want to do that.
[11654.54s -> 11658.80s]  We didn't want to have that kind of scenario play out.
[11658.80s -> 11661.44s]  Because then if you've seen stars video.
[11661.44s -> 11663.28s]  Then you've already seen my video.
[11663.28s -> 11666.18s]  You've already seen you've already seen it.
[11666.18s -> 11672.46s]  What could we add to that to make it so it was different for you.
[11672.46s -> 11677.31s]  And but also to you know backtrack.
[11677.31s -> 11680.11s]  Some people were uploading like three or four times a day.
[11680.11s -> 11681.50s]  We didn't do that.
[11681.50s -> 11684.78s]  I uploaded like twice a week.
[11684.78s -> 11685.90s]  Maybe two or three times a week.
[11690.32s -> 11691.17s]  Here we go.
[11691.17s -> 11700.10s]  Three two one zero zero.
[11703.22s -> 11706.18s]  This is Steve and this is the fish tank.
[11721.20s -> 11721.84s]  Run run.
[11732.75s -> 11733.31s]  Hey friend.
[11739.52s -> 11740.40s]  I did put it down.
[11741.68s -> 11744.43s]  He's gone.
[11744.43s -> 11745.47s]  This one.
[11745.47s -> 11746.11s]  There is this one.
[11746.11s -> 11747.23s]  It's a zombie.
[11747.23s -> 11749.23s]  You have to go on this bowl on the outside.
[11752.32s -> 11753.76s]  You fucking god damn it.
[11754.64s -> 11755.20s]  What did you.
[11756.48s -> 11757.68s]  I'm gonna make it.
[11759.79s -> 11760.43s]  I didn't make it.
[11762.10s -> 11763.38s]  You can't sleep now.
[11763.38s -> 11764.58s]  Yeah I can't sleep.
[11764.58s -> 11765.62s]  Yeah we just have to make our way to.
[11765.62s -> 11766.42s]  Where are you?
[11766.42s -> 11767.38s]  I'm down at the bottom.
[11767.94s -> 11770.98s]  Okay I'm coming.
[11770.98s -> 11773.70s]  What what I just zipped on what.
[11774.98s -> 11775.62s]  How do I do that?
[11775.62s -> 11776.90s]  I just wanted to jump to my death.
[11777.38s -> 11779.60s]  Oh I'm coming.
[11780.16s -> 11780.80s]  Oh wow.
[11786.38s -> 11786.70s]  Skip.
[11787.90s -> 11788.30s]  Skip.
[11790.93s -> 11791.97s]  They won't come in the door.
[11793.98s -> 11794.78s]  Oh yeah this.
[11797.18s -> 11797.82s]  Come on.
[11797.82s -> 11798.38s]  Come get us.
[11799.18s -> 11801.34s]  Don't shine the light on it.
[11801.34s -> 11801.82s]  It hurts them.
[11801.82s -> 11802.86s]  Let them like run at us.
[11810.02s -> 11811.74s]  Oh it's almost daytime.
[11813.76s -> 11815.36s]  They're just gonna like start dying.
[11815.36s -> 11816.96s]  Is this gonna be like Minecraft?
[11816.96s -> 11818.40s]  Are they gonna just sound like burning?
[11819.28s -> 11823.50s]  Come here you.
[11824.38s -> 11825.57s]  Knight survived.
[11826.29s -> 11827.73s]  Yeah he's just running now.
[11827.73s -> 11828.13s]  Chase them.
[11828.13s -> 11828.53s]  Chase them.
[11828.53s -> 11829.33s]  Oh yeah follow this guy.
[11829.33s -> 11830.21s]  Follow him.
[11830.21s -> 11831.81s]  Do not let this guy get away.
[11831.81s -> 11833.97s]  We need to find like the hideout for where these guys are.
[11836.11s -> 11836.91s]  Get out of the way.
[11836.91s -> 11838.11s]  You don't want to fucking shoot her.
[11840.19s -> 11842.11s]  Oh my god I'm gonna get a burn.
[11843.23s -> 11843.55s]  Damn it.
[11843.55s -> 11844.59s]  Oh which way do I go here?
[11844.59s -> 11846.75s]  I just my mom's gonna be so pissed at me.
[11846.75s -> 11847.87s]  How is he not dead yet?
[11847.87s -> 11848.75s]  Like what are you scared of?
[11848.75s -> 11849.23s]  I don't know.
[11850.35s -> 11851.79s]  Oh he jumped up here.
[11851.79s -> 11852.43s]  Go go go.
[11852.43s -> 11854.27s]  Oh no he can't get away.
[11854.27s -> 11855.23s]  Coffee.
[11855.23s -> 11856.03s]  Cheetos.
[11856.03s -> 11856.51s]  Chicken.
[11863.01s -> 11864.69s]  Hey can we help you?
[11864.69s -> 11866.29s]  Can we find your house or something?
[11866.29s -> 11867.49s]  Do you need help?
[11867.49s -> 11869.49s]  Uh yeah I could use a little bit of help.
[11870.69s -> 11871.33s]  He's on the run.
[11892.56s -> 11894.00s]  Hold on I need to see that again.
[11894.00s -> 11895.12s]  Do you need help?
[11895.12s -> 11897.12s]  Uh yeah I could use a little bit of help.
[11898.08s -> 11898.98s]  He's on the run.
[11907.38s -> 11908.50s]  He just hit his face.
[11915.10s -> 11917.66s]  It looks like he tried to slide under the fence.
[11917.66s -> 11919.42s]  He hit his head and died.
[11922.03s -> 11927.50s]  No we like cut him up now.
[11930.19s -> 11931.23s]  Who's Kratos?
[11931.23s -> 11932.51s]  Is that is that my name?
[11934.03s -> 11935.95s]  Did you just call someone on the phone?
[11937.87s -> 11941.50s]  Oh god I hear that and I don't even care.
[11947.20s -> 11950.80s]  He edited this like making it look like he fell for like 10 seconds.
[11952.37s -> 11954.37s]  It was like 5,000 foot drop.
[11967.52s -> 11968.96s]  I don't even know what we were trying to do.
[11971.38s -> 11972.18s]  Good joke.
[11972.18s -> 11973.14s]  Great joke.
[11973.14s -> 11974.58s]  That was a real good real good joke.
[11975.30s -> 11977.46s]  Your favorite pop tart cereal.
[11977.46s -> 11996.24s]  They're like come on let's go.
[11996.96s -> 11998.72s]  You think you can take me on?
[11998.72s -> 11999.92s]  You're just a bully.
[12000.56s -> 12001.12s]  Stay in there.
[12002.64s -> 12004.64s]  Another propane tank.
[12004.64s -> 12005.52s]  Stay here?
[12005.52s -> 12005.76s]  Yeah.
[12006.72s -> 12007.90s]  Why am I staying in here?
[12013.94s -> 12015.70s]  Hold on stay in there for a second.
[12015.70s -> 12018.74s]  We also would trade footage to each other if somebody had something funny.
[12019.46s -> 12021.07s]  Stay in there for a second.
[12024.62s -> 12026.14s]  Jerma I was never in there.
[12027.66s -> 12029.58s]  Yeah I know it's embarrassing.
[12029.58s -> 12030.14s]  It's embarrassing.
[12031.42s -> 12032.22s]  It's embarrassing.
[12035.90s -> 12038.22s]  Hold on stay in there for a second.
[12039.18s -> 12043.62s]  Stay in there for a second.
[12043.62s -> 12048.75s]  All right Jerma I was never in there.
[12051.23s -> 12053.23s]  I was standing right next to you the whole time.
[12058.03s -> 12059.18s]  I'm dead.
[12065.66s -> 12068.53s]  Okay this thing seems to be going well.
[12069.17s -> 12072.78s]  She's not gonna hear us coming.
[12072.78s -> 12075.18s]  Here comes my super stealth patented ninja kick.
[12078.72s -> 12079.04s]  Lagged.
[12079.92s -> 12081.87s]  Yes I'm a badass.
[12081.87s -> 12083.47s]  That actually happens in the game too.
[12083.47s -> 12084.59s]  Essentially that character only.
[12091.23s -> 12093.95s]  Why why why did I do that?
[12093.95s -> 12095.31s]  I sat here and I did that.
[12096.11s -> 12097.55s]  Okay that's what you have to understand.
[12098.43s -> 12099.87s]  Foliage is pretty fucking cool dude.
[12099.87s -> 12101.39s]  Look at all those.
[12101.39s -> 12110.21s]  Is that fucking hailing out right now?
[12113.09s -> 12114.37s]  Thank god.
[12114.37s -> 12114.69s]  Run.
[12118.69s -> 12119.73s]  There's like a bunch of birds.
[12119.73s -> 12120.77s]  First impression.
[12120.77s -> 12122.37s]  First impression of the birds.
[12122.37s -> 12123.17s]  They're pretty cool.
[12123.17s -> 12124.69s]  First impression of the zombies.
[12124.69s -> 12126.69s]  A little bit buttery on the hit there.
[12126.69s -> 12127.57s]  A little bit buttery.
[12128.61s -> 12129.97s]  And a little bit cream cheesy.
[12129.97s -> 12131.41s]  You know first impression of the zombie?
[12131.41s -> 12131.97s]  Cream cheese.
[12139.07s -> 12141.39s]  Somebody's throwing rocks.
[12141.39s -> 12144.19s]  No it's just I think it's like a hail or something weird.
[12151.87s -> 12152.99s]  All right we'll do a couple more.
[12153.79s -> 12155.55s]  And then I do have to leave.
[12156.94s -> 12157.98s]  Not because of the internet.
[12157.98s -> 12159.50s]  I mean it's been a pain in the ass.
[12159.50s -> 12162.30s]  But because I have to get Kim.
[12164.00s -> 12165.44s]  So we'll do the bits and everything.
[12165.44s -> 12165.76s]  We will.
[12166.48s -> 12169.12s]  But this stream was going to be a little shorter than usual.
[12169.84s -> 12172.62s]  Probably about like five-ish hours.
[12172.62s -> 12174.30s]  It could have been potentially longer.
[12174.30s -> 12177.78s]  But you know the internet problem.
[12177.78s -> 12178.42s]  You know.
[12178.42s -> 12180.02s]  So let's do a couple more.
[12180.02s -> 12180.98s]  What else are we going to do here?
[12184.86s -> 12186.62s]  I have to do the definition.
[12186.62s -> 12188.06s]  Add the definition of the German joke.
[12188.06s -> 12189.66s]  I mean we just watched the two of them.
[12194.27s -> 12196.51s]  I guess I'll put it on.
[12196.51s -> 12198.67s]  Just because we just watched them both.
[12200.53s -> 12202.21s]  It's an unlisted video right?
[12205.01s -> 12206.45s]  It's a hidden video.
[12206.45s -> 12217.17s]  Was it ever publiced?
[12221.17s -> 12222.93s]  Mods linking the good version.
[12222.93s -> 12224.13s]  What do you mean the good version?
[12224.69s -> 12231.14s]  There's been the good version.
[12231.70s -> 12233.14s]  Why is there a good version?
[12240.93s -> 12250.45s]  No I'm not going to watch me watching Star watch definition of a German joke.
[12250.45s -> 12255.01s]  No I'm going to watch me watching me in.
[12255.01s -> 12260.59s]  This is going to be ultra compression.
[12266.24s -> 12266.64s]  All right.
[12266.64s -> 12266.88s]  All right.
[12266.88s -> 12267.36s]  I'll watch it.
[12267.36s -> 12267.84s]  I'll watch it.
[12267.84s -> 12268.40s]  All right.
[12268.40s -> 12277.79s]  So you're going to get you're going to get dual commentary from the both of us.
[12277.79s -> 12300.37s]  I'm getting like a flash player error.
[12300.37s -> 12302.75s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[12302.75s -> 12315.76s]  I don't have flash anymore.
[12315.76s -> 12316.80s]  But not a flash.
[12316.80s -> 12317.68s]  It was like a little thing.
[12317.68s -> 12319.12s]  A little puzzle piece.
[12323.92s -> 12324.40s]  All right.
[12325.12s -> 12326.40s]  I should have it.
[12327.04s -> 12329.17s]  And here's the thing.
[12329.17s -> 12331.01s]  A lot of people have probably haven't seen this.
[12331.01s -> 12332.93s]  A lot of you probably have not seen this video.
[12333.65s -> 12335.89s]  So I guess we're going to have to give you some context.
[12336.77s -> 12338.77s]  Context is check it out.
[12340.99s -> 12341.47s]  All right.
[12341.47s -> 12343.55s]  I'm going to give my context and he can give his context.
[12343.55s -> 12347.65s]  Okay.
[12347.65s -> 12352.10s]  So when I play games and this is even like off stream or on stream.
[12352.10s -> 12352.58s]  Doesn't matter.
[12353.50s -> 12357.46s]  I just kind of say stuff.
[12357.46s -> 12359.14s]  Even when the camera's not even on.
[12359.78s -> 12360.34s]  I just talk.
[12361.42s -> 12362.38s]  I say anything.
[12362.38s -> 12364.30s]  I repeat something over and over again.
[12364.30s -> 12368.61s]  I'll just like a song.
[12368.61s -> 12369.49s]  I'll just say a song.
[12369.49s -> 12371.65s]  I'll say a line just over and over and over again.
[12371.65s -> 12374.85s]  Just because it's my brain just functioning and working overtime for no reason.
[12375.65s -> 12378.58s]  So it's just like a stream of consciousness.
[12378.58s -> 12378.82s]  Yeah.
[12378.82s -> 12381.22s]  Just it just flows out of my brain and I just do it.
[12382.02s -> 12384.90s]  So when we record these videos like you've been told before.
[12385.90s -> 12387.81s]  We edit a lot of shit.
[12387.81s -> 12391.74s]  And you cut out like all the times when you're like.
[12393.81s -> 12395.97s]  I believe I can fly.
[12395.97s -> 12398.29s]  I believe I can touch the sky.
[12398.29s -> 12399.41s]  And you do it like a hundred times.
[12399.41s -> 12400.85s]  You're just like, ah, that's not I'm going to get rid of that.
[12400.85s -> 12402.61s]  Because why would anybody want to hear me do that a hundred times?
[12403.25s -> 12412.29s]  Right.
[12412.29s -> 12416.53s]  Many of you guys may not have seen the definition of a German joke.
[12416.53s -> 12418.85s]  I wanted to watch this earlier and I forgot about it.
[12418.85s -> 12419.81s]  Oh, Star Chat.
[12421.42s -> 12424.62s]  This was one of the secret videos apart with the zombie jackass.
[12424.62s -> 12429.26s]  You can see zombie jackass 666 dude zombies amount of views.
[12429.26s -> 12430.94s]  The secret video 45,000 views.
[12430.94s -> 12432.30s]  I wish I had made this public.
[12433.26s -> 12436.46s]  This is one of my favorite videos I've ever made of me in German.
[12438.40s -> 12442.40s]  And it is so insanely bad.
[12442.48s -> 12443.92s]  It is so stupid.
[12443.92s -> 12447.28s]  But this is German in a one minute, 37 second nutshell.
[12447.28s -> 12449.04s]  This is like who he is as a person.
[12456.35s -> 12458.06s]  Got it.
[12458.06s -> 12458.94s]  What's in the crate?
[12462.29s -> 12464.32s]  Oh, dude, there's a fucking knife.
[12464.32s -> 12467.60s]  There's coffee, cheese, it's chicken.
[12467.60s -> 12468.00s]  Hold on.
[12469.44s -> 12470.16s]  This is what I'm saying.
[12470.16s -> 12472.08s]  Like we're compressing it like four times.
[12472.08s -> 12473.44s]  I got to turn this all the way up.
[12474.16s -> 12476.53s]  I'm not sure I can even turn this up.
[12486.06s -> 12486.62s]  That's loud.
[12486.62s -> 12488.38s]  But I don't think I can turn this up anymore.
[12490.16s -> 12490.72s]  All right, here we go.
[12491.90s -> 12492.38s]  I tried.
[12493.02s -> 12493.66s]  Stupid.
[12493.66s -> 12494.94s]  But this is German in a one minute, 37 second nutshell.
[12494.94s -> 12504.03s]  This is like who he is as a person.
[12504.03s -> 12505.76s]  Got it.
[12505.76s -> 12506.64s]  What's in the crate?
[12507.20s -> 12510.26s]  What am I gonna get?
[12510.26s -> 12511.94s]  Oh, dude, there's a fucking knife.
[12511.94s -> 12514.98s]  There's coffee, cheese, it's chicken.
[12515.70s -> 12518.66s]  Coffee, chicken, cheese, it's chicken.
[12518.66s -> 12520.90s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12520.90s -> 12522.98s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12522.98s -> 12524.42s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12524.42s -> 12526.10s]  It is like triggering me to do it.
[12526.10s -> 12527.86s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12528.34s -> 12530.18s]  We're gonna assume, we're gonna watch out.
[12530.18s -> 12532.42s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12532.42s -> 12534.26s]  Stop talking about coffee, Cheetos, or chicken.
[12534.82s -> 12537.14s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12537.14s -> 12540.34s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12540.34s -> 12541.54s]  He's like enabling me.
[12541.54s -> 12543.14s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12544.26s -> 12547.46s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12547.46s -> 12548.74s]  I didn't even realize this.
[12550.82s -> 12552.02s]  Holy shit.
[12552.02s -> 12552.34s]  Wow.
[12552.90s -> 12553.86s]  I didn't even pick this up.
[12553.86s -> 12554.74s]  It's been years.
[12555.38s -> 12558.50s]  He is enabling me to do this shit.
[12558.50s -> 12560.74s]  He's like triggering me to like do it.
[12560.74s -> 12562.26s]  He's like keeping me enabled.
[12563.23s -> 12563.63s]  Listen.
[12563.63s -> 12566.51s]  Eat Cheetos, chicken.
[12567.97s -> 12569.57s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12570.29s -> 12575.39s]  Oh, coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12575.39s -> 12575.95s]  Chicken.
[12575.95s -> 12576.27s]  Yeah.
[12577.15s -> 12584.83s]  Oh, coffee.
[12586.19s -> 12587.34s]  Whoa.
[12591.49s -> 12592.69s]  Cheetos, chicken.
[12592.69s -> 12594.61s]  Coffee, Cheetos.
[12594.69s -> 12596.05s]  Perhaps I should take both.
[12598.53s -> 12600.29s]  Perhaps I should take both.
[12600.29s -> 12601.73s]  I guess I'll take both.
[12601.73s -> 12602.77s]  Might be getting some Cheeto.
[12602.77s -> 12604.13s]  Might be getting some coffee.
[12604.13s -> 12606.69s]  Chicken, Cheetos, coffee, coffee.
[12609.81s -> 12611.73s]  Fucking coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12611.73s -> 12612.61s]  Oh, really?
[12612.61s -> 12613.65s]  Because guess what's in here.
[12614.53s -> 12617.97s]  Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[12617.97s -> 12619.41s]  There actually was coffee in there.
[12619.41s -> 12619.91s]  I know.
[12621.57s -> 12622.07s]  Yes.
[12625.25s -> 12626.61s]  I fucking loved it.
[12627.57s -> 12629.49s]  I laugh every time I watch it.
[12629.49s -> 12630.53s]  It is so bad.
[12631.17s -> 12632.93s]  I'm sitting here like I didn't mute my mic.
[12632.93s -> 12636.45s]  I'm like trying not to laugh to like not go over the video.
[12637.41s -> 12638.77s]  I want you to public it right now.
[12639.33s -> 12640.37s]  Did he public it though?
[12640.37s -> 12641.41s]  I don't even know if that works.
[12641.41s -> 12645.17s]  This is from January 30th, 2015.
[12646.21s -> 12647.89s]  What's going to happen next?
[12647.89s -> 12649.49s]  That's a great description.
[12649.49s -> 12649.73s]  What?
[12649.73s -> 12649.97s]  Yeah.
[12649.97s -> 12651.33s]  What's the next part?
[12651.33s -> 12652.45s]  Is he going to keep doing it?
[12652.45s -> 12652.95s]  Again?
[12654.42s -> 12654.92s]  God.
[12656.85s -> 12657.35s]  Listen.
[12660.96s -> 12663.28s]  Don't tell Jerm I've ever said anything nice about him.
[12664.78s -> 12670.45s]  But he is so good at making absolutely nothing funny sometimes
[12671.41s -> 12674.85s]  that for a while it was actually discouraging me from making videos.
[12677.63s -> 12679.15s]  At least that style of video.
[12679.15s -> 12682.19s]  I like my basically series because I feel like that's where I'm good at.
[12683.15s -> 12685.79s]  He could just go ahead and fucking make coffee,
[12685.79s -> 12688.19s]  Cheetos, and chicken funny for no fucking reason.
[12689.07s -> 12692.08s]  Well, hey, hold on, Star.
[12692.08s -> 12693.68s]  Before you let me interrupt you there.
[12697.02s -> 12700.46s]  His videos are some of the funniest fucking things I've ever watched.
[12704.42s -> 12710.29s]  Some of those edited videos are like 11 out of 10.
[12710.29s -> 12718.03s]  So friendship isn't friendship.
[12718.03s -> 12718.83s]  Just wonderful.
[12719.95s -> 12723.39s]  No, I think that, you know, whatever, I'll say it.
[12723.39s -> 12728.11s]  I think that I think that Star had some of the best videos on YouTube.
[12728.11s -> 12730.58s]  You know, I still think he does.
[12731.22s -> 12736.24s]  And I uploaded two.
[12736.24s -> 12738.80s]  I thought I uploaded some all right ones over the years.
[12738.80s -> 12742.91s]  You know, isn't that right?
[12743.55s -> 12744.83s]  Isn't that right, Star?
[12744.83s -> 12746.19s]  I cut the shirt on to prove it.
[12747.07s -> 12755.89s]  No, but for real, I will forever cherish how much fun this all was.
[12757.47s -> 12762.35s]  I've been 90 fucking years old just watching Family Feud in a bed.
[12762.99s -> 12766.24s]  And like somebody will say the word like Cheetos and I'll be like,
[12767.38s -> 12768.90s]  I remember that one.
[12769.86s -> 12771.46s]  That was a much slayed.
[12772.02s -> 12775.49s]  It's true.
[12775.49s -> 12776.45s]  That's fucking amazing.
[12777.95s -> 12783.54s]  But yeah, that's me being fucking strange and I just say words.
[12786.78s -> 12790.46s]  We will do, oh, mood.
[12791.26s -> 12791.74s]  Mood.
[12791.74s -> 12792.70s]  Oh yeah, mood.
[12802.58s -> 12806.02s]  What's the, because we're reaching over here about,
[12806.02s -> 12808.26s]  we'll be at about five hours after the bits probably.
[12811.65s -> 12812.61s]  Public that video?
[12812.61s -> 12813.81s]  I, that's his video.
[12813.81s -> 12816.21s]  I don't have, I don't have control over his channel.
[12822.72s -> 12823.44s]  Intervention.
[12829.31s -> 12830.67s]  Bargain Bin Beach Party.
[12831.94s -> 12833.06s]  Bloody Trapland.
[12836.05s -> 12837.17s]  You mad, bro.
[12837.17s -> 12838.05s]  You, what's this?
[12838.05s -> 12839.73s]  Why are you doing the you mad, bro thing?
[12846.58s -> 12847.86s]  Oh, yeah, we did Intervention.
[12847.86s -> 12849.14s]  We did Tactical Intervention already.
[12853.92s -> 12854.88s]  Zombie Penis.
[12862.24s -> 12863.68s]  Yeah, Zombie Penis is a good one.
[12865.44s -> 12866.48s]  Battle of the Toys.
[12866.48s -> 12867.76s]  That's also a good one too.
[12868.80s -> 12870.16s]  The, Battle of the Bots.
[12870.16s -> 12872.40s]  Battle of the Brainless Bots.
[12872.40s -> 12873.36s]  That's another good one.
[12881.04s -> 12882.24s]  All right, all right.
[12882.24s -> 12883.04s]  Here's what we're gonna do.
[12883.04s -> 12884.88s]  We're gonna do, we'll do Battle of the Brainless Bots
[12884.88s -> 12889.60s]  and then I'm gonna have to get out of here.
[12889.60s -> 12894.00s]  And I'm not gonna be live for at least tomorrow.
[12894.00s -> 12896.00s]  I'm gonna try to come back on Tuesday.
[12896.00s -> 12899.46s]  But I desperately need to get this fixed.
[12899.46s -> 12901.86s]  I'm gonna do whatever it takes over the next 48 hours
[12901.86s -> 12902.98s]  to make sure it works.
[12902.98s -> 12908.29s]  Because 100,000 drop frames is just unacceptable.
[12908.29s -> 12910.53s]  It's just, it's, it's unacceptable.
[12910.53s -> 12910.85s]  It is.
[12910.85s -> 12918.43s]  All right, let's get this on screen.
[12927.79s -> 12928.83s]  Do whatever, anything.
[12930.18s -> 12931.70s]  Okay, this is Battle of the Brainless Bots.
[12931.70s -> 12933.22s]  This is a TF2 video.
[12933.22s -> 12935.22s]  I might as well do, go out on a TF2 video.
[12935.22s -> 12946.88s]  All right, here we go.
[12952.59s -> 12954.67s]  Battle of the Brainless Bots.
[12955.23s -> 12959.70s]  This is when I pretend to go back in time to hydro.
[12959.70s -> 12960.74s]  No, that's another video.
[12961.30s -> 12963.33s]  All right, here we go.
[12964.72s -> 12965.76s]  Battle of the Brainless Bots.
[12966.78s -> 12967.82s]  End on Jerma is mad.
[12967.82s -> 12969.58s]  We've, I think we've already watched Jerma is mad.
[12969.58s -> 12972.43s]  At least once on this stream before.
[12972.43s -> 12974.99s]  Whoops.
[12974.99s -> 12976.11s]  No, go in full screen.
[12976.75s -> 12978.53s]  Hey, what are you doing?
[12985.49s -> 12987.33s]  No, it crashed.
[12987.33s -> 12989.49s]  It crashed, it froze and crashed.
[12989.49s -> 12990.53s]  I guess that's a new word.
[12999.65s -> 13000.77s]  I mean, if you guys like this,
[13000.77s -> 13003.86s]  if you guys think this is cool, we can do this again.
[13004.58s -> 13007.22s]  The only reason why we started to do this in the first place
[13007.22s -> 13008.50s]  is just because of the internet.
[13008.50s -> 13009.70s]  That's the only reason why we did it.
[13010.26s -> 13012.75s]  But if people like this and people think it's fun to,
[13013.79s -> 13023.82s]  um, keep doing this.
[13023.82s -> 13026.61s]  I think my, like my actual browser keeps crashing.
[13027.25s -> 13029.97s]  Damn, yes, come on.
[13032.06s -> 13033.58s]  It brings in the bucks.
[13034.30s -> 13037.94s]  Nah, it's just fun to, I would only want to do this
[13037.94s -> 13042.18s]  if it was, um, like I hadn't seen them in a while.
[13042.18s -> 13044.18s]  I don't, I want to watch ones that I haven't seen
[13044.18s -> 13045.86s]  because it's almost like, I forget some of the shit
[13045.86s -> 13046.58s]  that's in these videos.
[13047.63s -> 13049.15s]  A lot of these things I forget, actually.
[13049.95s -> 13052.35s]  It's been so long and I've put together,
[13052.35s -> 13054.75s]  I've seen so many clips and I've seen
[13055.87s -> 13056.99s]  so many timelines, right?
[13056.99s -> 13058.11s]  That it's almost hard to remember.
[13058.75s -> 13062.03s]  All right, can I please fucking interact with this?
[13065.02s -> 13065.90s]  Finally, Jesus.
[13066.70s -> 13068.70s]  All right, took long enough.
[13068.70s -> 13070.08s]  All right, here we go.
[13070.64s -> 13071.76s]  Battle of the Brainless Bots.
[13076.22s -> 13077.50s]  Three, two, one.
[13078.78s -> 13084.16s]  Jeremy, I'm already just so exhausted
[13084.16s -> 13086.96s]  from even trying to put this together.
[13087.20s -> 13093.15s]  There hasn't been an ounce of enthusiasm
[13093.15s -> 13094.75s]  in my voice since we started talking about this,
[13094.75s -> 13095.47s]  but now we're ready.
[13095.47s -> 13098.11s]  I sent you the info, let's do this.
[13098.11s -> 13100.51s]  You like do not want to do this at all.
[13102.19s -> 13104.03s]  That's like makes it, I was like threw up.
[13104.03s -> 13105.07s]  Did you hear that?
[13105.07s -> 13105.87s]  A little bit, yeah.
[13106.91s -> 13109.31s]  So here's the, here's what the deal is, right?
[13109.31s -> 13111.23s]  So here's Star, he's the soldier right here.
[13111.95s -> 13113.47s]  He's on red team, I'm on blue team.
[13113.47s -> 13114.19s]  This is upward.
[13114.75s -> 13118.83s]  We are going to both have a team of easy mode bots.
[13118.83s -> 13121.31s]  That means our bots are at the lowest difficulty
[13121.31s -> 13122.99s]  they could possibly be at.
[13122.99s -> 13124.67s]  And why is there a tank?
[13125.23s -> 13126.59s]  This feels familiar.
[13126.59s -> 13130.06s]  So easy, easy mode.
[13131.18s -> 13133.42s]  No, no, don't break your own fucking server.
[13135.98s -> 13137.58s]  They kept training into him.
[13138.78s -> 13140.14s]  Can you give me one second
[13140.14s -> 13141.98s]  to like just explain what's happening?
[13146.54s -> 13148.06s]  Look at this mess.
[13149.71s -> 13152.35s]  I can't believe you made like a trail to yourself.
[13153.78s -> 13154.18s]  Okay.
[13155.78s -> 13157.86s]  Yeah, even in really didn't think
[13157.86s -> 13159.30s]  you were ever going to be able to do this.
[13160.98s -> 13165.46s]  You brought the truck punchline over into team fortress two
[13165.46s -> 13166.98s]  and your server is going to crash.
[13168.26s -> 13169.70s]  There's no way we're making out of this one.
[13170.66s -> 13172.26s]  This place is shutting down.
[13173.98s -> 13175.98s]  Shit's like flying by my screen.
[13176.94s -> 13179.42s]  Oh no, we invested our money poorly.
[13179.98s -> 13181.58s]  We didn't put it into a 401k.
[13182.30s -> 13183.42s]  It's disappearing.
[13184.86s -> 13186.38s]  All of our money is disappearing.
[13187.02s -> 13189.58s]  Quick, somebody make a German and Bitcoin joke.
[13189.58s -> 13190.06s]  Quick.
[13190.06s -> 13192.30s]  You wanted to invest in a lollipop company.
[13192.30s -> 13193.34s]  It's all gone.
[13193.34s -> 13193.58s]  All right.
[13193.58s -> 13193.98s]  Come on out.
[13197.60s -> 13198.88s]  They are not leaving.
[13198.88s -> 13200.80s]  Oh yeah, they were one person is.
[13200.80s -> 13202.16s]  It seems two of them has left.
[13203.36s -> 13205.76s]  All right, there we go.
[13205.76s -> 13206.80s]  They're making some progress.
[13206.80s -> 13207.20s]  Don't worry.
[13207.20s -> 13211.68s]  We have our sentry set up in a very optimal situation with a scout.
[13212.56s -> 13213.68s]  They're actually pretty smart.
[13215.28s -> 13216.40s]  I think my guys are pushing it.
[13216.40s -> 13216.72s]  We got it.
[13216.72s -> 13220.08s]  We got a heavy medic combination coming in through the front control point here.
[13220.08s -> 13220.88s]  Pyro coming out here.
[13220.88s -> 13222.88s]  It looks like you see your spine.
[13223.52s -> 13224.64s]  No, I'm watching them.
[13227.20s -> 13228.08s]  What are they doing?
[13231.84s -> 13233.04s]  What is he still doing?
[13237.76s -> 13239.28s]  Oh, okay.
[13239.28s -> 13241.28s]  I'm going to pay attention to something else.
[13241.28s -> 13243.12s]  Why is they doing a melee fight?
[13244.40s -> 13246.24s]  Are you kidding me right now?
[13248.08s -> 13248.72s]  What the fuck?
[13250.16s -> 13252.72s]  Did you seriously make every single person a spy?
[13252.72s -> 13253.04s]  Yes.
[13253.76s -> 13254.72s]  Oh, my God.
[13255.68s -> 13256.56s]  What are they doing?
[13257.92s -> 13259.28s]  What is your team doing?
[13259.28s -> 13259.68s]  What are?
[13261.04s -> 13263.22s]  Why are they freaking out in the corner over here?
[13263.86s -> 13265.30s]  That's just what spies do.
[13265.30s -> 13267.06s]  This is what you should be aiming for.
[13268.74s -> 13269.94s]  Oh, make sure you're disguised.
[13269.94s -> 13271.30s]  Yeah, they keep jumping and jumping.
[13271.30s -> 13275.14s]  I just heard like 10 seconds.
[13276.19s -> 13279.47s]  I wonder why they're trying to jump through the boards.
[13280.27s -> 13281.39s]  That doesn't work like that.
[13281.39s -> 13282.91s]  You're not like made out of taffy.
[13284.19s -> 13284.83s]  Here we go.
[13287.25s -> 13287.81s]  Here they come.
[13290.69s -> 13293.09s]  They're just all disguised as the same person.
[13294.58s -> 13295.30s]  Don't even tell me.
[13295.30s -> 13297.62s]  Please don't tell me they're all going to keep coming out of this door.
[13298.58s -> 13299.78s]  Where else would they go?
[13299.94s -> 13300.42s]  I don't know.
[13300.42s -> 13301.70s]  There's only one option.
[13301.70s -> 13302.58s]  I am a spy.
[13302.58s -> 13303.54s]  I go out this door.
[13304.18s -> 13306.26s]  All you a spy is an enemy.
[13306.26s -> 13308.18s]  I think you like broke them.
[13308.18s -> 13308.58s]  Hold on.
[13308.58s -> 13309.54s]  Let me see where they are.
[13309.54s -> 13310.02s]  I forget where they are.
[13310.02s -> 13310.90s]  Are they done?
[13310.90s -> 13312.74s]  No, they're all going out the front door now.
[13312.74s -> 13314.26s]  They're all going out the front door.
[13315.30s -> 13316.66s]  That spy is an enemy.
[13319.17s -> 13321.57s]  Okay, this is stupid.
[13322.82s -> 13323.70s]  Nobody's even attacking.
[13323.70s -> 13325.14s]  You don't want to tell me what stupid is.
[13325.14s -> 13326.50s]  No, they're going after each other.
[13331.65s -> 13331.81s]  No.
[13332.77s -> 13333.89s]  Did you get backstabbed?
[13333.89s -> 13335.25s]  I got backstabbed.
[13335.25s -> 13336.69s]  There was one too many of them.
[13337.49s -> 13338.61s]  No one's even going to go for the point.
[13339.25s -> 13341.89s]  This is going to last exactly three minutes and 32 seconds
[13342.93s -> 13346.05s]  because there's absolutely no way any of these brainless son of a bitches
[13346.05s -> 13347.09s]  are going to go for that point.
[13349.73s -> 13353.41s]  Okay, this one engineer is really just going for gold.
[13354.75s -> 13355.63s]  We actually capped it.
[13356.43s -> 13357.71s]  How the hell did that happen?
[13357.71s -> 13358.11s]  I don't know.
[13358.11s -> 13359.39s]  Maybe it had something to do with the tank.
[13359.39s -> 13365.15s]  They just crushed that guy.
[13365.15s -> 13366.27s]  It's just bad.
[13366.27s -> 13368.43s]  It just starts running people over.
[13368.43s -> 13369.95s]  They're all going to get stuck on it.
[13370.83s -> 13373.62s]  Blocking the door.
[13373.62s -> 13375.06s]  Yeah, this guy's freaking out.
[13375.06s -> 13376.02s]  Let's get trickstabbed.
[13376.02s -> 13376.66s]  No, no, no.
[13377.30s -> 13379.22s]  Is it actually making its way in?
[13379.22s -> 13379.94s]  No, it's not.
[13379.94s -> 13380.26s]  Is it?
[13380.98s -> 13381.70s]  Please crush them.
[13381.70s -> 13383.38s]  Please crush them.
[13383.38s -> 13385.06s]  You go like crushing them.
[13388.58s -> 13389.70s]  No, it didn't kill them.
[13389.70s -> 13390.82s]  They got in.
[13391.30s -> 13392.42s]  It's fine right here.
[13393.54s -> 13395.46s]  It's just getting fucking run over.
[13397.34s -> 13399.42s]  It's trying to like shoot it with a shotgun.
[13411.90s -> 13412.62s]  I'm going to die.
[13416.00s -> 13418.16s]  This should not have happened.
[13418.16s -> 13421.14s]  They're actually doing enough damage to it.
[13424.06s -> 13426.70s]  Here are some engineers on the back of the tanks.
[13426.70s -> 13427.10s]  Yes.
[13428.06s -> 13430.42s]  I'm going to kill it.
[13431.06s -> 13433.98s]  Oh, you didn't think this could get even dumber.
[13433.98s -> 13435.18s]  Elders react.
[13436.30s -> 13438.22s]  They just keep getting run over.
[13444.58s -> 13448.56s]  All right, redo, retake, redo.
[13448.56s -> 13450.32s]  I need like a second before I throw up.
[13451.20s -> 13453.65s]  Why are they all taunting?
[13454.37s -> 13458.18s]  They don't even know what to shoot yet.
[13459.81s -> 13461.01s]  Why are they not shooting you?
[13461.01s -> 13462.13s]  Because the round doesn't start.
[13462.13s -> 13463.09s]  I'm not supposed to be on here.
[13463.73s -> 13467.25s]  Oh, they're that confused about the round not being started yet.
[13467.25s -> 13468.85s]  That they refuse to shoot you.
[13470.78s -> 13471.18s]  What?
[13471.18s -> 13471.58s]  What are they?
[13472.54s -> 13473.34s]  This doesn't make any...
[13473.34s -> 13475.10s]  Wait, oh, I want to see what happens in one second.
[13480.38s -> 13483.26s]  How is anybody on Blue Team going to get anything done?
[13484.42s -> 13486.42s]  You have such a huge advantage.
[13487.06s -> 13489.06s]  Because you're allowed to build your sentries first.
[13489.06s -> 13492.82s]  My guys are being like dumbasses trying to do like leapfrog in the spawn.
[13492.82s -> 13495.54s]  Hey, you could be a little bit more respectful.
[13496.34s -> 13497.22s]  Just wait.
[13497.22s -> 13499.38s]  Wait till this 12 seconds counts down.
[13499.94s -> 13503.06s]  I bet you every single one of these guys just walks out and just gets eaten alive.
[13504.46s -> 13505.82s]  Eaten alive by what?
[13505.82s -> 13507.58s]  We barely have a defense.
[13507.58s -> 13508.78s]  The sentry mosquitoes.
[13510.06s -> 13510.86s]  All right, here we go.
[13510.86s -> 13512.62s]  Why do you need a catchphrase for everything?
[13512.62s -> 13513.02s]  Here we go.
[13513.02s -> 13513.58s]  Let's see what happens.
[13514.38s -> 13515.74s]  That's better than anything else is going to work.
[13515.74s -> 13516.62s]  Because they all backed up.
[13516.62s -> 13519.50s]  Why do you have to have a catchphrase for everything?
[13519.50s -> 13520.14s]  Let's build it back here.
[13520.14s -> 13521.74s]  Let's start getting these teleporters up.
[13522.86s -> 13523.66s]  They're so confused.
[13523.66s -> 13526.30s]  Fioritizing the teleporters over sentries.
[13526.30s -> 13528.54s]  Yeah, they'd rather build teleporters than sentries.
[13530.06s -> 13532.94s]  No, seriously, this was done.
[13532.94s -> 13534.30s]  The joke was over.
[13536.38s -> 13538.62s]  That joke ended so long ago.
[13539.90s -> 13544.42s]  Why do you have to fucking ruin everything?
[13550.94s -> 13552.14s]  Good times.
[13552.14s -> 13553.34s]  Good times, man.
[13553.34s -> 13554.46s]  Good times, man.
[13555.18s -> 13556.94s]  I'm just in the corner over here hanging out.
[13556.94s -> 13557.66s]  Good times.
[13562.02s -> 13562.74s]  All right, guys.
[13564.05s -> 13565.89s]  I have to end the stream.
[13576.13s -> 13578.61s]  Oh, back when I was in my prime.
[13578.61s -> 13580.45s]  I was so, I was so handsome.
[13587.78s -> 13595.04s]  I do apologize again for the extreme internet problems.
[13596.06s -> 13600.26s]  But I'm going to try to get them fixed.
[13600.26s -> 13601.14s]  That's all I can do.
[13601.14s -> 13601.86s]  I'm just going to try.
[13604.16s -> 13608.64s]  Hopefully we can come back strong here without any problems at all on Tuesday.
[13608.64s -> 13613.38s]  If for some reason it's still really bad on Tuesday
[13613.38s -> 13615.62s]  and I can get it fixed on Tuesday, I'll let you know.
[13617.62s -> 13620.08s]  At this point, I don't know.
[13620.08s -> 13621.52s]  I'm shooting for Tuesday.
[13621.52s -> 13629.38s]  So just keep an eye on the sus over the next 24 hours and we'll find out.
[13629.38s -> 13632.58s]  But yeah, this was fucking fun.
[13634.82s -> 13640.16s]  It makes me happy that we can kind of just go back
[13640.16s -> 13641.52s]  and watch some of those old videos.
[13642.56s -> 13645.18s]  You guys are fucking awesome.
[13645.18s -> 13647.54s]  It's been a long time.
[13647.54s -> 13649.54s]  It's been fucking almost 10 goddamn years.
[13650.18s -> 13651.47s]  Holy shit.
[13652.83s -> 13657.47s]  Oh, but let us say good night for now.
[13657.47s -> 13659.86s]  See you again possibly on Tuesday.
[13659.86s -> 13661.65s]  I will keep you updated.
[13661.65s -> 13665.09s]  I will probably make a tweet about it just to make sure everyone knows what's going on.
[13665.09s -> 13667.44s]  Thanks for watching.
[13667.44s -> 13680.88s]  As always, at least we salvaged it, right?
[13680.88s -> 13684.40s]  So let's go to the bits from earlier today.
[13685.04s -> 13689.92s]  See you soon.
[13690.48s -> 13690.88s]  Take care.
[13694.38s -> 13696.22s]  If you thought that was fun, we can do it again.
[13696.22s -> 13699.58s]  I just, I don't really do a whole lot of kind of react
[13700.06s -> 13703.34s]  or watch kind of videos on stream type of stuff.
[13704.06s -> 13705.97s]  But every once in a while, it's fine.
[13705.97s -> 13708.77s]  You know, do that like once every couple months or something once a month.
[13709.57s -> 13711.54s]  We'll see.
[13711.54s -> 13712.02s]  That was fun.
[13712.58s -> 13716.03s]  So let's head back to four or five hours ago here.
[13717.06s -> 13720.18s]  We had, we had a lot of community subs.
[13720.18s -> 13722.62s]  We had a bunch from, we'd five from Kazzy.
[13723.18s -> 13724.62s]  We had five from soup store.
[13726.59s -> 13727.55s]  Thank you for those.
[13727.55s -> 13732.91s]  We had three dollars from, from thanks for the FAMAS.
[13733.71s -> 13735.55s]  Thanks for the three bucks.
[13735.55s -> 13739.49s]  It's been, I've been watching you for so many years.
[13739.49s -> 13740.69s]  It's needs to do with retrospective.
[13740.69s -> 13743.01s]  Yeah, that's the first time I've watched those videos
[13743.01s -> 13744.61s]  since at least a few years.
[13744.61s -> 13745.97s]  So it's cool.
[13747.10s -> 13748.54s]  But thank you for the three dollars.
[13748.54s -> 13749.66s]  First time I've ever seen a stream.
[13749.66s -> 13752.38s]  Thanks for being, thanks to being British.
[13752.38s -> 13755.58s]  But thank you for helping me through a lot in the past few years.
[13755.58s -> 13756.14s]  Much love.
[13757.28s -> 13760.43s]  Thanks to being British, British.
[13772.08s -> 13773.76s]  Oh, the time zone, right?
[13773.76s -> 13774.98s]  The time zone.
[13774.98s -> 13776.66s]  Oh, I was like, wait, what?
[13776.66s -> 13778.69s]  I was like, I'm British, am I?
[13780.14s -> 13781.50s]  Multi trip, thanks to the three dollars.
[13781.50s -> 13783.42s]  Have some money to make you feel better.
[13783.42s -> 13783.98s]  No, I'm sorry.
[13783.98s -> 13786.46s]  I can't, I can't let it get to me anymore.
[13786.46s -> 13788.30s]  You know, I can't like, it's going to happen.
[13789.02s -> 13792.80s]  I'd rather just relax and just deal with it, right?
[13792.80s -> 13796.96s]  That I, what's going to happen if I get fucking angry and furious?
[13796.96s -> 13798.24s]  No, I can't believe that shit.
[13799.38s -> 13800.42s]  It's not going to do anything.
[13800.42s -> 13806.22s]  So just make what you can with what you got, right?
[13806.22s -> 13807.50s]  That's what you can do.
[13807.50s -> 13810.34s]  I'm not going to let it bother me.
[13812.50s -> 13814.10s]  And it turned out to be a fun stream anyway.
[13814.10s -> 13815.89s]  So that's fine.
[13817.09s -> 13820.77s]  Sam and Max though, that's a, we got to figure out where I'm going to put that.
[13821.33s -> 13823.81s]  Because I want to do Garden Flipper DLC.
[13823.81s -> 13826.54s]  When I, the first stream when I come back is probably,
[13831.66s -> 13834.46s]  we'll probably have to make, I don't know, it's going to be hard.
[13834.46s -> 13836.54s]  I'm going to, I'll put it somewhere next week.
[13836.54s -> 13840.53s]  So we're going to do Garden Flipper when we come back.
[13840.53s -> 13844.05s]  And then I want to play those episodes in Sam and Max,
[13844.05s -> 13846.21s]  because we just kind of get screwed over today.
[13846.21s -> 13852.18s]  We'll figure it out.
[13852.18s -> 13855.33s]  We'll figure it out, don't worry.
[13855.33s -> 13857.81s]  But thank you to some guy for the 15 bucks.
[13857.81s -> 13858.53s]  Thank you, some guy.
[13859.41s -> 13862.37s]  I got screwed by the last course of this semester last Friday pretty hard.
[13862.93s -> 13864.69s]  I probably failed it as well.
[13864.69s -> 13866.37s]  At least you put a smile on my face
[13866.37s -> 13869.01s]  due to the fact that you are screwed even harder by cocks.
[13875.82s -> 13877.10s]  But thank you for the 15 dollars.
[13878.66s -> 13881.55s]  I'm not sure what, what course it was,
[13882.62s -> 13886.50s]  or what classes are, you know, fucking with you.
[13886.50s -> 13891.09s]  But all you can do is, you know, if you have, you know,
[13891.09s -> 13893.81s]  some bad grades or bad GPA or had something happen,
[13894.45s -> 13896.48s]  you just got to keep doing it.
[13896.48s -> 13898.08s]  Keep, try, you know.
[13899.95s -> 13900.99s]  Do what you can.
[13900.99s -> 13914.10s]  I had a 4.0 semester.
[13914.10s -> 13915.62s]  Well, aren't you Mr. Smart?
[13919.39s -> 13922.67s]  I had a couple of spots in college where I didn't do very well.
[13924.11s -> 13930.37s]  I was just borderline above what's it called?
[13931.18s -> 13931.98s]  Probation, right?
[13933.07s -> 13934.35s]  Academic probation.
[13934.35s -> 13937.23s]  I was like maybe, I was like,
[13937.23s -> 13940.19s]  I was probably two or three tests away,
[13940.75s -> 13942.99s]  or one letter grade away from being on academic probation.
[13943.87s -> 13948.86s]  But then I, I kind of got myself situated.
[13948.86s -> 13950.06s]  I started to do better.
[13950.06s -> 13952.69s]  I had like a 3.0, I think, total,
[13952.69s -> 13955.49s]  or like a 2.9 or like a 3.1 or something, whatever it was.
[13955.49s -> 13959.71s]  But all you can do is just keep going.
[13959.71s -> 13962.75s]  There's no secret formula, right?
[13962.75s -> 13972.64s]  But yeah, I've had my fair share of troubles in school.
[13973.28s -> 13979.26s]  But thank you for the 15 dollars.
[13979.26s -> 13979.82s]  Wish you luck.
[13981.52s -> 13982.80s]  Hopefully you can figure it out.
[13983.68s -> 13984.08s]  Thank you.
[13985.79s -> 13987.31s]  Son of Genova, thanks for the 250.
[13987.31s -> 13988.75s]  This was one of your best moments.
[13989.39s -> 13990.67s]  This was one of the best moments.
[13994.69s -> 13998.43s]  Oh, this is the...
[14010.32s -> 14010.72s]  That's true.
[14010.72s -> 14011.44s]  That's true.
[14011.44s -> 14013.76s]  You will quiet, everyone will be quiet and say,
[14013.76s -> 14014.32s]  what is he doing?
[14014.32s -> 14014.96s]  Because you're the teacher.
[14014.96s -> 14015.76s]  You're not supposed to do that.
[14016.56s -> 14019.12s]  The teacher is not supposed to make the weird noises.
[14019.12s -> 14020.08s]  The kids are.
[14020.08s -> 14021.84s]  So that's just like, why did he just do that?
[14022.72s -> 14023.20s]  Silence.
[14024.24s -> 14024.80s]  Okay.
[14024.80s -> 14026.16s]  So now that I have your attention,
[14026.88s -> 14031.36s]  but thank you for the 250.
[14031.36s -> 14032.64s]  And that like shitty mic,
[14035.55s -> 14036.59s]  like was so bad.
[14037.39s -> 14038.99s]  That was the pre-move mic.
[14040.80s -> 14043.28s]  Thank you, Frost, for the five dollars.
[14043.28s -> 14044.64s]  I hope chat doesn't bother you too much
[14044.64s -> 14046.16s]  when internet stuff is happening.
[14046.16s -> 14047.04s]  I watch no matter what
[14047.04s -> 14048.48s]  because you are quite a comedic talent.
[14049.82s -> 14051.50s]  Thanks for the five dollars, Frost Tro.
[14053.87s -> 14054.35s]  No, it...
[14055.07s -> 14056.75s]  Chat doesn't bother me when that happens.
[14057.55s -> 14061.84s]  It bothers me that I want the stream to be fun
[14061.84s -> 14064.48s]  and watchable and I don't want it to buffer
[14064.48s -> 14065.52s]  and cut out on people.
[14065.52s -> 14069.28s]  And when it happens, I get frustrated at that
[14069.84s -> 14071.44s]  because I want the stream to be good.
[14071.44s -> 14072.48s]  I want the stream to be...
[14073.20s -> 14076.40s]  I can pay attention and we can go through something
[14076.40s -> 14078.88s]  and you don't have to worry about some other force
[14080.21s -> 14082.13s]  negatively affecting your stream.
[14085.12s -> 14087.92s]  So no, chat messing around.
[14087.92s -> 14088.80s]  And no, that's not...
[14089.86s -> 14090.50s]  That's not the issue.
[14090.50s -> 14093.73s]  The issue is I want the stream to be watchable.
[14093.73s -> 14095.65s]  And if it isn't, then I have a problem
[14095.65s -> 14099.10s]  because that's what I'm doing here.
[14099.10s -> 14102.67s]  But I expect it to be fixed in the next couple of days.
[14102.67s -> 14102.91s]  I do.
[14102.91s -> 14105.25s]  I really do.
[14105.33s -> 14106.29s]  I have somebody...
[14106.29s -> 14109.17s]  I have a supervisor at Cox that every time there's a problem like this,
[14109.17s -> 14111.17s]  it takes like a week or two, but they get it done.
[14111.73s -> 14112.61s]  They fix it.
[14112.61s -> 14116.48s]  It's over and it's good for like three months.
[14116.48s -> 14118.72s]  So I'm confident that they will get it done.
[14118.72s -> 14119.28s]  I am.
[14119.28s -> 14127.36s]  At least I hope so.
[14127.36s -> 14128.24s]  Otherwise, that would be bad.
[14130.06s -> 14130.86s]  But thank you, Frost.
[14133.58s -> 14136.14s]  Thank you, Mr. Atigan, for these six dollars here.
[14138.06s -> 14139.66s]  Jermyn, when he's upset and angry,
[14139.66s -> 14141.74s]  don't forget about the baby running into the cabinets
[14141.74s -> 14142.54s]  in layers of fear.
[14143.70s -> 14144.18s]  That's true.
[14146.21s -> 14147.33s]  That was unbelievable.
[14148.83s -> 14151.31s]  That may have been the strangest thing I've ever captured
[14152.19s -> 14153.07s]  in front of my face.
[14159.97s -> 14162.13s]  And then they say, go box italics.
[14162.13s -> 14163.33s]  Why would I do that?
[14163.33s -> 14165.09s]  That's not...
[14165.09s -> 14165.33s]  No.
[14170.58s -> 14172.42s]  Thank you, Heldrich, for the five dollars.
[14172.42s -> 14173.78s]  Hey, Jerm, I've been watching for years.
[14174.86s -> 14175.98s]  Thank you for that.
[14175.98s -> 14178.30s]  I'm so happy to see how much success you've had.
[14178.30s -> 14179.98s]  You're an inspiration, my dude.
[14179.98s -> 14181.50s]  Keep up the good work, PS.
[14181.50s -> 14185.86s]  Alter Ego Mail had me crying laughing.
[14185.86s -> 14190.53s]  I'm glad it did because it was fucking crazy.
[14190.53s -> 14191.84s]  But thank you so much.
[14192.40s -> 14193.60s]  Glad to have you for that long.
[14196.90s -> 14198.42s]  Thank you so much for the five dollars as well.
[14202.96s -> 14204.80s]  Mentosium, thanks for the 250.
[14205.36s -> 14207.14s]  Any updates on Movie Night 2?
[14210.61s -> 14211.41s]  No.
[14211.41s -> 14214.26s]  I don't really have an update for you.
[14214.26s -> 14215.54s]  There's a lot of things
[14215.54s -> 14217.46s]  that I'm trying to do at the same time.
[14218.26s -> 14221.74s]  And that kind of fell backwards
[14222.38s -> 14223.82s]  behind a couple of the other things
[14223.82s -> 14225.90s]  that I am putting higher on the priority list.
[14230.16s -> 14232.24s]  So there are other things that have taken priority
[14232.24s -> 14234.00s]  from that second Movie Night
[14234.00s -> 14234.88s]  to like set it up.
[14235.44s -> 14243.95s]  Play Monster Rancher DS.
[14246.58s -> 14248.26s]  Yeah, I got to figure out how to cap DS
[14248.26s -> 14251.38s]  because there's a lot of games on DS to play
[14251.38s -> 14252.18s]  and mess around with.
[14252.82s -> 14257.39s]  Jerma lied about Movie Night 2.
[14257.39s -> 14257.87s]  Here it comes.
[14257.87s -> 14258.43s]  Make another one.
[14258.43s -> 14259.15s]  Make another one.
[14259.15s -> 14260.91s]  No, we'll eventually, we'll probably,
[14261.79s -> 14263.47s]  I think we'll eventually do it.
[14263.47s -> 14267.46s]  That was the most viewed stream ever.
[14270.64s -> 14271.44s]  Yeah, I know.
[14271.44s -> 14274.88s]  But it's important to me
[14275.52s -> 14276.90s]  that even if something,
[14276.90s -> 14278.18s]  let's say something really works
[14278.18s -> 14279.62s]  and it's really like, for instance like that
[14279.62s -> 14280.74s]  and like the Jerma Rumbles,
[14280.74s -> 14281.54s]  there's a lot,
[14281.54s -> 14282.74s]  there was probably eight,
[14282.74s -> 14285.70s]  9,000 people watching the last Jerma Rumble.
[14286.66s -> 14288.74s]  Just because an audience is there that's large,
[14289.81s -> 14291.73s]  I want to make sure that it's done right.
[14291.73s -> 14294.05s]  And I don't want to just keep doing it just to do it
[14294.05s -> 14296.21s]  because I know that people will come and watch it.
[14296.85s -> 14298.66s]  I want to make sure that it's fun
[14298.66s -> 14300.02s]  and that it's worth doing
[14300.02s -> 14301.46s]  and that people will think it's fun
[14301.46s -> 14303.06s]  and it's not just something that I'm pumping out
[14304.22s -> 14306.53s]  on a, just to get it out there, right?
[14307.26s -> 14309.02s]  That's my philosophy for a lot of things.
[14309.02s -> 14313.02s]  Jerma lied about picking up Kim.
[14313.66s -> 14316.45s]  So maybe it would be easy
[14316.45s -> 14317.97s]  just to throw together that Movie Night
[14318.85s -> 14321.28s]  It's almost like I want it to be
[14321.92s -> 14325.25s]  the way that I want it to be.
[14325.25s -> 14326.85s]  It's weird to talk about.
[14331.07s -> 14332.27s]  When are you going to stream with Joel?
[14334.48s -> 14337.34s]  I'm not sure, there's two Joels.
[14337.34s -> 14338.30s]  Talking about Joel,
[14338.30s -> 14340.22s]  like the Joel that I just hung out with
[14340.22s -> 14347.94s]  or Joel the trash talking wrestling.
[14347.94s -> 14355.46s]  Yeah, we talked, he got really busy.
[14355.46s -> 14356.98s]  So yeah, you're talking about,
[14356.98s -> 14358.98s]  you're talking about Varg.
[14358.98s -> 14360.82s]  Yeah, he got really busy.
[14360.82s -> 14362.42s]  And he said, I'm really busy.
[14362.42s -> 14363.46s]  I'm sorry I was working.
[14363.46s -> 14364.50s]  He was working on a bunch of stuff.
[14364.50s -> 14365.94s]  So we just said, all right,
[14365.94s -> 14367.06s]  we'll figure it out some other time.
[14367.86s -> 14372.24s]  But he had a lot of projects going on at the time.
[14372.80s -> 14374.74s]  So I'll probably throw the line out
[14374.74s -> 14375.54s]  eventually here soon.
[14378.26s -> 14379.22s]  We were thinking maybe,
[14382.27s -> 14385.39s]  no, I'll keep that under wraps.
[14385.39s -> 14390.90s]  But there you'll probably see something interesting.
[14390.90s -> 14394.43s]  Co-op penis stream.
[14394.43s -> 14395.71s]  Why did I read that out loud?
[14395.71s -> 14398.96s]  And second of all, what are you talking about?
[14398.96s -> 14399.76s]  I don't know why I do it.
[14399.76s -> 14402.48s]  I'm telling you, I'm so unableable.
[14402.48s -> 14403.52s]  People could just say that.
[14405.17s -> 14406.05s]  I don't, did some stuff.
[14406.05s -> 14407.89s]  The coffee cheeto, like I just,
[14407.89s -> 14409.57s]  it's just, I have to say it.
[14409.57s -> 14412.77s]  I am like, so you can lead me
[14412.77s -> 14415.89s]  like with a carrot on a stick into a cliff.
[14415.89s -> 14416.93s]  I will fall off of it.
[14418.75s -> 14422.77s]  I'm very unableable.
[14422.77s -> 14425.38s]  But yeah, we'll see.
[14425.38s -> 14426.10s]  We'll see what happens.
[14428.00s -> 14429.28s]  Cad, thank you Cad.
[14429.28s -> 14431.84s]  BTV, resident video game developer.
[14432.56s -> 14433.52s]  Thanks for the 250.
[14434.32s -> 14436.64s]  Look at this ego maniac watching his old videos
[14436.64s -> 14437.92s]  in front of 4,300 people.
[14437.92s -> 14439.44s]  I bet he stares in the mirror for hours
[14439.44s -> 14440.16s]  talking to himself.
[14440.16s -> 14440.88s]  Yes, I do.
[14440.88s -> 14441.68s]  Yes, that does happen.
[14443.98s -> 14445.82s]  I will just have full conversations
[14445.82s -> 14446.70s]  with myself in the mirror.
[14446.70s -> 14447.74s]  I do it like all the time.
[14459.79s -> 14460.77s]  Full.
[14460.77s -> 14465.70s]  A full, into the mirror, full frontal.
[14465.70s -> 14469.22s]  And I just do a play to myself.
[14469.22s -> 14470.98s]  And I'm the actor and I'm the audience.
[14475.57s -> 14476.29s]  I knew it.
[14480.99s -> 14482.75s]  He's insane.
[14482.75s -> 14487.78s]  Thank you though.
[14491.14s -> 14493.86s]  Hey, thank you Lula Moore for the five dollars.
[14494.74s -> 14496.58s]  Please do the layers of fear video.
[14498.77s -> 14501.09s]  Um, not right now.
[14501.09s -> 14501.97s]  Not right now.
[14501.97s -> 14503.81s]  I've got to get out of here.
[14505.54s -> 14515.90s]  Save it for another time.
[14515.90s -> 14517.66s]  Thank you to Frodeon Weapon for the 350.
[14517.66s -> 14518.38s]  Thank you, Frodeon.
[14521.22s -> 14522.66s]  Not to be an attention hog,
[14522.66s -> 14525.30s]  but you taking my stream name idea made my day.
[14526.42s -> 14527.22s]  Dear my heart.
[14527.22s -> 14528.50s]  Plus, as much as I love Sam and Max,
[14528.50s -> 14530.18s]  reminiscing over some of your greatest videos
[14530.18s -> 14531.14s]  is even better.
[14531.14s -> 14532.90s]  Hope your internet issue gets resolved.
[14532.90s -> 14533.54s]  Happy Sunday.
[14534.10s -> 14535.82s]  Happy Sunday to you as well.
[14537.30s -> 14540.91s]  And yeah, I'm good.
[14540.91s -> 14541.31s]  I'm good.
[14542.19s -> 14543.34s]  It'll get fixed.
[14543.90s -> 14546.03s]  Just got to deal with it for now.
[14546.03s -> 14547.15s]  And we'll get back to normal.
[14547.71s -> 14550.61s]  As of hopefully Monday or Tuesday or so.
[14551.17s -> 14554.34s]  Or if Wednesday, Tuesday,
[14554.34s -> 14555.86s]  I'm going to try as hard as I'm going to.
[14555.86s -> 14558.26s]  I'm going to get up as early as possible tomorrow
[14558.26s -> 14559.70s]  and make like three phone calls.
[14560.42s -> 14563.58s]  I'm going to be phone call businessman tomorrow.
[14563.58s -> 14564.22s]  Just juicy.
[14576.26s -> 14578.02s]  Frontal mirror stream.
[14578.02s -> 14579.78s]  And then I will be removed from the platform.
[14580.50s -> 14581.38s]  But thank you, Frodeon.
[14581.94s -> 14584.18s]  Thank you, Hans Beets for the five community subs.
[14584.18s -> 14584.74s]  Thanks, Hans.
[14585.74s -> 14587.74s]  Five subs on top of all the other ones
[14587.74s -> 14588.46s]  that we're on tonight.
[14588.46s -> 14588.78s]  Thank you.
[14592.59s -> 14595.15s]  CadBTV, again 250, would you?
[14596.05s -> 14598.85s]  Who would you shit your pants for on stream?
[14600.18s -> 14600.58s]  Nobody.
[14602.10s -> 14602.90s]  No, but no one.
[14603.46s -> 14604.35s]  Maybe my mother.
[14606.50s -> 14608.02s]  If my mother needed me to stream with her
[14608.02s -> 14610.98s]  or something, it would be my mom or...
[14612.46s -> 14613.10s]  That's probably it.
[14622.74s -> 14623.30s]  Not Kim?
[14625.02s -> 14625.42s]  No, I...
[14627.60s -> 14629.60s]  No, there's context here.
[14629.60s -> 14630.88s]  There's context here.
[14631.76s -> 14632.88s]  There's context.
[14640.83s -> 14642.35s]  Thank you for the 250.
[14642.35s -> 14642.91s]  Appreciate it.
[14651.62s -> 14657.76s]  But thank you, Sticks Renegade for the 250.
[14657.76s -> 14659.58s]  Hey, Jerma, with your permission,
[14659.58s -> 14662.94s]  I want to custom order one car sticker of your Jerma J
[14662.94s -> 14666.06s]  to put on my sticker bombed Corolla
[14666.06s -> 14667.90s]  from those sticker maker websites.
[14667.90s -> 14668.78s]  Is that okay with you?
[14668.78s -> 14672.14s]  If so, I can show you the car when I get the sticker.
[14672.14s -> 14673.58s]  If not, that's completely understandable.
[14674.38s -> 14678.88s]  Oh, you want to have...
[14678.88s -> 14680.24s]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[14680.24s -> 14683.28s]  I'm going to call my lawyer
[14683.28s -> 14684.32s]  to see what he says about that.
[14688.45s -> 14689.89s]  No, that was 9-1-1.
[14689.89s -> 14691.01s]  That's the wrong number.
[14692.27s -> 14694.19s]  That would not be who I would call.
[14695.15s -> 14698.27s]  Hey, nobody was going to steal my copyright.
[14707.04s -> 14707.84s]  Oh, this is the...
[14708.48s -> 14708.96s]  Yeah, you get...
[14708.96s -> 14712.08s]  Well, let's forward you to that department,
[14712.08s -> 14714.22s]  the copyright police.
[14721.82s -> 14723.82s]  Yeah, I mean, I don't have any stickers or anything.
[14725.02s -> 14727.98s]  I might actually make some stuff like that for fun
[14728.70s -> 14731.12s]  because I have that teespring store
[14731.12s -> 14734.24s]  and you can make hats, mugs, socks.
[14735.89s -> 14737.89s]  Stickers, you can do that.
[14737.89s -> 14742.56s]  So there probably will be more of that added just for fun.
[14743.36s -> 14747.06s]  I don't expect thousands of people to be like,
[14747.06s -> 14748.50s]  I have my merch, buy it.
[14749.14s -> 14751.62s]  But it doesn't cost anything for me to do that.
[14752.66s -> 14754.34s]  So I'm sure I would do it at some point.
[14757.55s -> 14757.87s]  Pins?
[14757.87s -> 14758.75s]  I wonder if they have pins.
[14758.75s -> 14759.31s]  I'll take a look.
[14759.31s -> 14761.31s]  Does Teespring do pins on their stores?
[14761.87s -> 14765.76s]  I don't know.
[14765.76s -> 14767.12s]  Dr. Clay, thanks for the 250.
[14767.12s -> 14768.16s]  I did some research for you.
[14768.16s -> 14769.68s]  Here's the origin of that sound.
[14771.71s -> 14772.51s]  Really?
[14772.51s -> 14775.92s]  This is from the BattleBots.
[14776.00s -> 14782.53s]  That is where that's from.
[14783.09s -> 14785.87s]  Why would you make that a hit sound?
[14786.43s -> 14788.74s]  Of all the things, why?
[14789.46s -> 14796.86s]  It was just me going, oh,
[14798.14s -> 14800.67s]  there wasn't anything spectacular about that.
[14809.15s -> 14811.23s]  Thank you to Talos for the 10 bucks.
[14811.95s -> 14813.95s]  Talos03, thanks for 10 dollars.
[14814.51s -> 14817.12s]  As soon as you gave us that heartfelt speech
[14817.12s -> 14819.12s]  about streaming still being fun after all these years,
[14819.12s -> 14820.24s]  I went out and got some bits.
[14820.88s -> 14822.48s]  You've got me through some tough times, Jerma.
[14822.48s -> 14824.08s]  I can always count on you to make me laugh.
[14824.64s -> 14828.54s]  It is still fun.
[14829.89s -> 14831.89s]  That's why I tend to get upset
[14831.89s -> 14835.84s]  when something gets in the way.
[14839.98s -> 14841.82s]  We have a pretty large community here now,
[14841.82s -> 14843.98s]  and I want it to be fun.
[14843.98s -> 14845.18s]  I don't want it to be like,
[14845.18s -> 14846.54s]  oh, here we go.
[14846.54s -> 14847.58s]  Look at this.
[14847.58s -> 14847.98s]  Look at me.
[14849.42s -> 14852.54s]  120,000 drop frames, cocks.
[14853.36s -> 14854.16s]  And yeah, it's a joke.
[14854.16s -> 14857.20s]  I know you guys don't mean half of it sometimes,
[14857.20s -> 14858.08s]  and it's not a big deal,
[14858.08s -> 14859.92s]  but it is to me because I want it to be good,
[14859.92s -> 14861.76s]  and I want you to enjoy every second of the stream.
[14861.76s -> 14862.32s]  I don't want it to be,
[14863.28s -> 14865.01s]  you know, well, you know,
[14865.01s -> 14866.93s]  15% of that stream was fucked.
[14867.57s -> 14869.20s]  Couldn't even watch it.
[14869.92s -> 14878.70s]  So it means a lot to me that I'm able to do it,
[14878.70s -> 14880.06s]  and it's able that I can do the things
[14880.06s -> 14881.10s]  that I want to do that day.
[14881.90s -> 14885.22s]  But it is still a blast every time.
[14885.22s -> 14886.98s]  I still have a great fucking time,
[14886.98s -> 14889.14s]  which means that I'm going to keep doing it.
[14891.65s -> 14895.81s]  I'm happy that you find the streams worth watching,
[14896.45s -> 14898.13s]  even when there are problems like this,
[14898.13s -> 14899.09s]  like that happened today
[14899.09s -> 14901.25s]  with the technical internet kind of stuff.
[14901.89s -> 14906.21s]  Even still, that you're able to stick with me there
[14906.21s -> 14906.93s]  and stick through that.
[14907.57s -> 14907.89s]  Thank you.
[14912.42s -> 14913.94s]  It's worth the pain.
[14913.94s -> 14914.66s]  I hope so.
[14916.75s -> 14917.23s]  But thank you.
[14923.17s -> 14925.09s]  Thank you Skeleton Toast for the $5.
[14925.81s -> 14928.93s]  Hey, Jerma, I don't you remember,
[14928.93s -> 14930.45s]  but nearly a year ago I asked you
[14930.45s -> 14932.85s]  for some words of encouragement, of courage,
[14932.85s -> 14934.93s]  before I went into surgery for my brain condition.
[14935.49s -> 14937.33s]  Due to my meds and constant doctor's appointments,
[14937.97s -> 14940.29s]  I've never really gotten the chance to catch your streams.
[14940.29s -> 14942.85s]  So to say thank you and let you know
[14942.85s -> 14944.05s]  that everything went fine.
[14945.34s -> 14946.94s]  Not cured, but hey, not dead.
[14947.66s -> 14949.10s]  Thanks for helping me get through that day.
[14949.10s -> 14950.86s]  And whenever it gets too much,
[14950.86s -> 14953.66s]  I'm pretty sure the Fat Engie
[14953.66s -> 14957.20s]  was the first video of yours that I ever saw.
[14957.20s -> 14959.44s]  Well, I'm fucking incredibly happy
[14959.44s -> 14961.44s]  that you're all right.
[14961.44s -> 14974.05s]  And that video was, that game was so good.
[14981.60s -> 14988.69s]  I'm so grounded and thankful that somebody,
[14990.66s -> 14992.34s]  that I'm helping you through that.
[14992.90s -> 14998.62s]  That's, I'm glad you're fucking all right.
[14998.62s -> 15010.38s]  Thank you so much for the $5 and stick with it.
[15010.94s -> 15016.34s]  Much love to you, for real.
[15016.90s -> 15025.38s]  That was Skeleton Toast.
[15037.52s -> 15042.46s]  Thank you so much to Zalaski for the $2.50.
[15042.46s -> 15045.98s]  Hey, Jerma, why were, why were you the friend
[15045.98s -> 15047.74s]  who shows you their favorite movie
[15047.74s -> 15049.98s]  and says this is the best part during the whole movie?
[15053.49s -> 15055.57s]  Oh, yeah, I was, I was going like,
[15057.57s -> 15059.01s]  yeah, but here's the thing though.
[15059.81s -> 15062.21s]  But like most of us have seen the movie, right?
[15062.21s -> 15063.57s]  We've all seen the movie.
[15063.57s -> 15065.49s]  So you and I are looking,
[15065.49s -> 15068.05s]  are looking at each other and we're both,
[15068.05s -> 15070.13s]  yeah, here, yeah, here it comes.
[15070.85s -> 15072.27s]  You know, you've seen the movie too.
[15072.27s -> 15073.15s]  So we both like are like,
[15073.15s -> 15074.35s]  yeah, this is it, right here, man.
[15082.34s -> 15084.82s]  And I complained about that person like two weeks ago.
[15084.82s -> 15085.62s]  That's fucking funny.
[15088.29s -> 15089.41s]  Let's get the credits on the screen.
[15090.05s -> 15097.57s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh, there they go.
[15098.37s -> 15102.46s]  Hey, Easy Peep, Easy Peep 81.
[15102.46s -> 15104.78s]  That's a, that's a pretty good subscription
[15104.78s -> 15106.62s]  considering we watched that video.
[15116.88s -> 15118.40s]  Oh, that's fucking fun.
[15118.40s -> 15122.64s]  So we had a few more bits that came through.
[15122.64s -> 15123.36s]  Thank you everybody.
[15123.36s -> 15126.03s]  All the subs, all the gifted subs,
[15126.03s -> 15127.87s]  all the resubs, everybody.
[15132.24s -> 15134.56s]  Might see a redesign of this as well,
[15135.50s -> 15136.30s]  if it's possible.
[15136.30s -> 15138.14s]  I might have this be changed
[15138.94s -> 15144.78s]  on top of all the other things
[15145.73s -> 15148.93s]  that Ballordow is in the current process
[15148.93s -> 15149.73s]  of making right now.
[15156.45s -> 15158.05s]  And we got a couple more bits here.
[15158.05s -> 15163.25s]  We had a brain just froze.
[15163.25s -> 15166.29s]  I'd ever agree for the five dolls.
[15166.29s -> 15168.90s]  Do you have any tips for streaming?
[15168.90s -> 15169.94s]  You're hilarious, dude.
[15171.33s -> 15172.85s]  Tips for streaming would be
[15172.85s -> 15174.05s]  make sure you're doing it for fun.
[15174.61s -> 15175.41s]  Make sure you're doing it
[15176.21s -> 15177.33s]  because you want to do it.
[15177.33s -> 15179.17s]  Make sure you're doing it not for money,
[15179.17s -> 15180.69s]  not for power, not for fame,
[15181.25s -> 15182.69s]  but because you want to.
[15183.41s -> 15184.21s]  It's very important.
[15188.83s -> 15190.59s]  And do something that you're comfortable doing.
[15192.00s -> 15193.84s]  Find your zone.
[15193.84s -> 15195.12s]  Find your spot that you know
[15195.12s -> 15195.92s]  that you'd like to do
[15196.64s -> 15197.36s]  and see what happens.
[15200.69s -> 15202.37s]  Power, power.
[15208.00s -> 15209.04s]  All you can do is see what happens
[15211.89s -> 15212.61s]  and just make sure you're
[15212.61s -> 15213.89s]  realistic with your goals.
[15213.89s -> 15215.17s]  Make sure you're realistic with yourself
[15219.14s -> 15220.50s]  and do your best
[15221.22s -> 15228.83s]  because at this point
[15228.83s -> 15230.27s]  there's a lot of people that stream now
[15230.91s -> 15234.99s]  and trying to kind of
[15234.99s -> 15236.35s]  poke your head above the crowd
[15236.35s -> 15237.23s]  can be very difficult.
[15238.48s -> 15240.32s]  So just stay true to yourself.
[15240.32s -> 15241.76s]  Do what you know that you like to do
[15241.76s -> 15242.64s]  and that you're good at doing
[15244.03s -> 15245.39s]  and try to have as much fun as you can
[15246.93s -> 15248.13s]  and see what happens.
[15255.97s -> 15257.01s]  Power hungry.
[15258.99s -> 15262.24s]  You must accept the power.
[15262.88s -> 15266.02s]  Trust Jermo.
[15266.02s -> 15267.46s]  No, then you wrote he's short.
[15271.42s -> 15273.50s]  And there are plenty of cases of people
[15273.50s -> 15274.46s]  that start streaming
[15274.46s -> 15275.58s]  and then they just they grow
[15275.58s -> 15276.46s]  and they grow and they grow.
[15278.38s -> 15280.62s]  It's not like, oh, it's impossible now.
[15280.62s -> 15283.68s]  There's a lot of cases.
[15283.68s -> 15285.36s]  There's always cases of people
[15286.08s -> 15287.62s]  grabbing some audience.
[15288.26s -> 15296.80s]  But I've had kind of moments like this
[15296.80s -> 15297.76s]  where I've talked about before
[15298.56s -> 15300.61s]  but it's hard to give advice
[15300.61s -> 15302.53s]  because I know what I do
[15303.41s -> 15305.01s]  and I know the way that I like to stream
[15305.01s -> 15307.89s]  and the way the things that I like to try.
[15308.53s -> 15309.65s]  It's hard to give advice to people
[15309.65s -> 15310.93s]  that might not be the same.
[15310.93s -> 15313.09s]  We might not have the same ideas.
[15313.09s -> 15314.85s]  We might have the same things
[15314.85s -> 15316.29s]  we're trying to do on stream.
[15318.83s -> 15320.19s]  There's not a whole lot of real good
[15320.19s -> 15321.63s]  like just advice
[15321.63s -> 15322.83s]  like blanket statement advice
[15322.83s -> 15324.19s]  on how to be a streamer.
[15324.75s -> 15326.67s]  You kind of have to make that on your own.
[15326.67s -> 15328.11s]  You have to figure out what that's going to be.
[15335.25s -> 15338.53s]  Kim is sitting in the hail at soccer practice
[15338.53s -> 15339.57s]  waiting to be picked up.
[15345.55s -> 15346.51s]  No, she's not.
[15351.79s -> 15356.26s]  But I wish you the best of luck.
[15357.79s -> 15358.59s]  Do it and have fun.
[15364.85s -> 15365.89s]  Is it still hailing?
[15365.89s -> 15366.93s]  No, that was really weird.
[15366.93s -> 15367.73s]  It was just hitting them.
[15368.29s -> 15369.89s]  Smashing into the windows and stuff.
[15369.89s -> 15370.45s]  It was crazy.
[15374.18s -> 15375.54s]  Dr. Clay at the very end here.
[15375.54s -> 15376.50s]  Thank you for the 250.
[15377.92s -> 15378.64s]  Even though the stream
[15378.64s -> 15379.84s]  was the result of bad internet
[15379.84s -> 15381.92s]  I just want to say that it was fun watching this.
[15381.92s -> 15383.20s]  I always enjoyed hearing the comments
[15383.20s -> 15385.12s]  from the perspective of the creator.
[15385.12s -> 15386.80s]  Nonetheless, hope everything is fixed
[15386.80s -> 15388.56s]  and you can go back to streaming without issues.
[15388.56s -> 15389.04s]  Take care.
[15391.06s -> 15391.54s]  Me too.
[15392.26s -> 15392.58s]  Me too.
[15393.30s -> 15395.06s]  I hope it's completely gone
[15395.06s -> 15396.18s]  as of the next day or two.
[15400.13s -> 15402.93s]  Yeah, I had a lot of fun on the stream.
[15402.93s -> 15404.45s]  I'm surprised that we were able to go
[15404.45s -> 15405.25s]  like five hours.
[15406.66s -> 15407.86s]  Kind of just melted.
[15407.86s -> 15409.46s]  The time just sort of disappeared
[15409.46s -> 15410.34s]  for a little while there.
[15410.98s -> 15417.55s]  Do I like sand?
[15417.55s -> 15420.06s]  Yeah, sand is cool.
[15425.10s -> 15427.18s]  And then finally right at the end we had Spooge.
[15429.36s -> 15430.80s]  Thanks for the three bucks.
[15431.60s -> 15434.00s]  Nine months sub now, Jeremy.
[15434.00s -> 15434.96s]  The baby is due.
[15435.60s -> 15437.12s]  But in all seriousness I want to let you know
[15437.12s -> 15441.12s]  that I had gotten a 30 on my ACT the first try
[15441.12s -> 15443.04s]  and I almost broke down about it.
[15443.04s -> 15445.68s]  I'm super excited and I appreciate you for being here
[15445.68s -> 15446.96s]  for all of us who have been stressing
[15446.96s -> 15447.92s]  about finals in school.
[15448.72s -> 15449.60s]  Love you, man.
[15449.60s -> 15451.28s]  I'll always be here and love every stream.
[15453.82s -> 15454.38s]  First try.
[15455.57s -> 15456.77s]  First try.
[15456.77s -> 15459.70s]  Holy shit.
[15460.26s -> 15465.44s]  Congratulations.
[15465.92s -> 15471.14s]  I, thanks for the nine months in a row.
[15471.14s -> 15472.26s]  30 out of 36.
[15472.26s -> 15473.30s]  That's pretty damn good.
[15473.86s -> 15478.16s]  That's pretty damn good.
[15482.37s -> 15484.13s]  30 out of 1600.
[15484.13s -> 15485.81s]  Oh, that would not be good.
[15486.45s -> 15496.21s]  Who doesn't like sand?
[15496.21s -> 15496.69s]  I don't know.
[15496.69s -> 15497.57s]  I don't know.
[15497.57s -> 15501.04s]  But yeah, congratulations on that.
[15502.88s -> 15503.60s]  That you should be pretty,
[15503.60s -> 15504.48s]  you should be very proud of that.
[15504.48s -> 15508.59s]  So thank you everybody.
[15508.59s -> 15509.23s]  That's my time.
[15511.90s -> 15513.34s]  We just, just over five hours.
[15513.34s -> 15513.82s]  Okay.
[15513.82s -> 15515.02s]  That's our, that's good then.
[15515.02s -> 15515.74s]  I'm okay then.
[15515.74s -> 15516.70s]  I'm all right with this stream.
[15517.26s -> 15518.22s]  I'm all right with it, I guess.
[15518.22s -> 15518.62s]  I'm okay.
[15519.26s -> 15522.21s]  I was scared there for a minute
[15522.21s -> 15523.57s]  that we were only going to get to
[15523.57s -> 15525.17s]  be live for like an hour and 10 minutes
[15525.17s -> 15526.53s]  and I would have been really sad about it.
[15527.09s -> 15528.05s]  So I'm all right with that.
[15531.06s -> 15534.02s]  I will see you guys hopefully by Tuesday.
[15535.31s -> 15536.99s]  If that is not the case,
[15536.99s -> 15538.03s]  I will make sure to let you know.
[15538.03s -> 15539.47s]  Just keep an eye on the sus
[15539.47s -> 15541.63s]  as of Monday night, Tuesday morning.
[15542.64s -> 15543.60s]  I'll make a tweet.
[15543.60s -> 15544.72s]  We'll probably on Tuesday morning
[15544.72s -> 15546.08s]  you give an update on how things are going.
[15553.86s -> 15554.66s]  Take care everybody.
[15555.22s -> 15557.10s]  Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[15558.26s -> 15558.98s]  See you very soon.
[15560.22s -> 15561.58s]  Ta ta for now.
[15579.98s -> 15581.98s]  I believe it is currently too early for legends
[15581.98s -> 15584.64s]  because I streamed less.
[15584.64s -> 15585.92s]  Yeah, I streamed yesterday.
[15585.92s -> 15588.16s]  So I did that late at night.
[15588.16s -> 15589.84s]  So no stream legends unfortunately.
[15589.84s -> 15590.40s]  Sorry guys.
[15592.77s -> 15593.97s]  See you real soon.
[15593.97s -> 15595.26s]  Have a great night.
