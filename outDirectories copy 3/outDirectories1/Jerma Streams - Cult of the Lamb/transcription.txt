[6.07s -> 14.95s]  Hello. Hello. I'm Andy. I'm Andy. I'm always a late Andy. I'm Landy. I'm Andy. I'm always late Andy.
[15.67s -> 18.79s]  I just like messed that up. Whatever. I practiced that for like 10 minutes.
[18.79s -> 29.24s]  I was in the mirror practicing that for an hour. Minus 50 minutes. Landy. Is this an ad?
[29.88s -> 43.10s]  Well, hold on. Not yet. Landy. We're gonna play two things today. We're gonna play Call to the
[43.10s -> 51.83s]  Lamb. It's out. It's out today, right? Or is it yesterday? Yesterday. Oh, spoiler. You know,
[51.83s -> 57.00s]  I don't want you to hear the music. Can you stream in an hour? I'm kind of busy. Well,
[57.56s -> 65.21s]  I was supposed to start an hour ago. Pre-stream chat knows. I made it three o'clock so I could go,
[65.21s -> 70.87s]  oh man, hey, I'm live at two. And then I had to make a few very, very important phone calls
[70.87s -> 83.58s]  and that didn't work. Hey, but it's okay. I only turned out to be like 12, 10 minutes late
[83.58s -> 87.34s]  rather than an hour and 10 minutes late. So it's a good thing I didn't make it two o'clock, right?
[89.06s -> 97.05s]  Now you're thinking with portals. No, but how you doing? Welcome back. Today, we're going to be
[97.05s -> 105.21s]  playing Cult of the Lamb. Like I said earlier, should be fun. I've heard very, very good things.
[105.21s -> 109.69s]  I've heard people say that this is probably one of the better games that's come out this whole year.
[110.33s -> 117.05s]  The Twitch extension works. It's just very, very slow. I'll wait. I'll turn that on another time.
[117.69s -> 126.30s]  Once it's like good to go because I'm probably going to be playing this again. I didn't set that
[126.30s -> 131.61s]  up if I had to because like they turned it off. They turned it on. They updated it. They turned
[131.61s -> 138.71s]  it off. I'm going to wait until it's good to go. Yeah, we're going to play that for a little while
[138.71s -> 145.26s]  and then I'm going to move to Two Point Campus, which is going to be a sponsored part of the
[145.26s -> 152.04s]  stream. So Cult of the Lamb not sponsored. Two Point Campus is sponsored. I'm going to do a half
[152.04s -> 165.34s]  and half today. This game is so good. I'm going in completely blind here. I can't wait. I'm going to
[165.34s -> 173.83s]  say my mic is what? Your mic is picking up the music from the game. It is absolutely not. Is it?
[174.47s -> 192.12s]  Hold on a second. No, it isn't. No, you're full of shit. Your mic is picking up several dangerous
[192.12s -> 202.18s]  pathogens. What do you mean? It's doing it? Hold on. What? What do you think? Wait, when I talk,
[202.18s -> 212.33s]  you can hear it. What do you mean by that? It comes in when you talk. Huh? Hold on. Wait,
[212.41s -> 219.62s]  we have to do a test. So you're saying that if I keep the microphone open and have the noise
[219.62s -> 232.81s]  gate not come through, you hear the music. What? Yeah, I don't. I have absolutely no idea why
[232.81s -> 243.93s]  that's happening. Hold on. Does it fix it? No, that's not even the right mic. I am so confused.
[246.47s -> 252.31s]  Funny mic. What do you mean? What do you mean funny mic? That's the webcam.
[254.15s -> 263.02s]  Hold on. What happened? Why is it doing that? I have no response to this. Hold on.
[267.08s -> 278.89s]  OK, I don't want. Tell me if this fixes it. Did that fix it or is it still happening?
[280.18s -> 290.26s]  Uh. It's not there, but don't ask. I just turned off literally everything.
[292.15s -> 302.07s]  But let me answer me this. You do hear it now, though, right? Scream into your webcam. OK,
[302.07s -> 307.99s]  we're good. I might not do face cam. I don't I have really I have I have unbrushed teeth today
[307.99s -> 313.96s]  and I haven't taken a shower or anything. So I look like a fucking just gross person. I don't
[313.96s -> 319.42s]  know. I might not have cam on today. I have a I have really unbrushed teeth. I'm just telling
[319.42s -> 332.54s]  you. That's a fact. I'm ready to play. You want to see what should we see what I look like?
[332.54s -> 338.94s]  I'm telling you, I have wicked bad unbrushed teeth. I know this sounds like an annoying thing
[340.01s -> 346.98s]  where I turn the cam on and I look fine. I look great. But I just tell you, oh, I haven't
[346.98s -> 353.82s]  showered. I haven't brushed my teeth. Everyone goes, oh, but you look so good. Right. How do I
[353.82s -> 363.98s]  look? I literally I just I like I woke up like this and I didn't change it. How do I look?
[363.98s -> 374.65s]  How do my teeth look? Literally no one could have could have. Look at my hair, though.
[374.65s -> 386.60s]  This is called my head was mushed into the pillow. This is like I'm sleepy. It's not balding.
[387.32s -> 392.62s]  Who cares if I'm if I bald? Why is my webcam flickering? Like there's a candle in front of
[392.62s -> 401.98s]  me. Guys, if I go bald, whatever, I'm almost 40. OK, if I go bald, that's a normal human reaction
[401.98s -> 411.38s]  to getting older is balding a little. Oh, I turn 40 soon. If I go bald, go cares. I made it a long
[411.38s -> 418.26s]  time with all this hair. I don't even care. You look good for a guy that's in a zombie movie.
[418.26s -> 422.79s]  All right. Well, it's coming off for now. If you're good, it'll come back. You have to be good,
[422.79s -> 433.66s]  though. Good, though. Oh, my goodness. That might have been the worst one yet.
[433.66s -> 440.79s]  That might have been the worst one in a decade. Hold on. I got to turn this down.
[440.79s -> 450.66s]  Why do my gohooks a lot change all of its settings? That was weird because this is
[450.66s -> 457.86s]  routing the wrong way. Whatever. It's fine. OK, here we go. Call to the lamb. I'm ready to play.
[457.86s -> 468.74s]  It should be fun. Your face came on. I will if you're good. You got to be good. You're aging
[468.74s -> 481.78s]  backwards and praise the lamb conduit to great power. Almost no sacrificial beast take heed
[481.78s -> 490.98s]  for a crown cannot sit upon two brows. All right. All you had to tell me there was x, x, x, x, x,
[490.98s -> 499.40s]  y, y, y, b, b, b, x, x, x, x, y, y, y, y, b, b. That's all you had to say. x, x, x, x, x, y, y, y, y,
[499.40s -> 518.66s]  b, b, b. This game was in the if you don't remember, this game was part of the Steam
[518.66s -> 525.83s]  demo day week, and it was one of our favorites. So I'm really glad to be playing it right now.
[528.47s -> 532.95s]  Where's this? Where's my precious streamer space? If you're good, you have to be good.
[537.54s -> 538.74s]  Azimala.
[538.74s -> 547.22s]  Vora stands the last of its kind, all others we have hunted down and put to the blade.
[549.37s -> 552.73s]  With this final sacrifice, the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.
[553.45s -> 558.97s]  The heretic who lies bound below will be condemned to eternal captivity,
[559.77s -> 584.46s]  and the old faith shall be preserved. So I'm dead. This is the eternal being that's been chained
[584.46s -> 596.47s]  down here for centuries, over 200 years. Come closer, fear not. Though you are already dead,
[596.55s -> 602.42s]  I still have need of you. This foolish bishop thought they could keep you from me in death,
[602.42s -> 608.10s]  but instead they sent you straight to me. I will give you life again, but at a price.
[611.64s -> 626.26s]  All I ask is you start a cult in my name. Do we have a deal? Yes. Sure. And so it came to pass
[626.26s -> 633.66s]  that the Countess, once bathed in rejuvenating blood. I've never heard the rest of that dialogue,
[633.66s -> 641.40s]  by the way. I've always pressed click right after that part. All right, let's go.
[643.42s -> 655.10s]  X, X, X, X, Y, Y, Y, B, B, B. I forgot how fun this game was. This game was, it's like,
[655.10s -> 670.47s]  okay, it's kind of like Finding of Isaac, kind of like Legend of Zelda, kind of like Star Tropics,
[672.65s -> 686.02s]  kind of like Frickin' Morty. Not. Like Dark Souls? I would, I don't think so. Fear not,
[686.02s -> 690.42s]  I am Rattau. I was once a chosen vessel like you, but those days are lost to the winds.
[693.21s -> 697.77s]  I was sent to guide you. We are deep in the lands of the Old Faith and in grave danger.
[699.16s -> 702.68s]  My instructions are to lead you to safety, continue through the woods, escape lies ahead.
[702.68s -> 718.36s]  I will be close by. Sick. Is this your fucking house? Is this like Dark Souls? It's a little
[718.36s -> 732.58s]  bit like Dark Souls, a little bit like Frickin' Morty. I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[733.51s -> 741.32s]  That's making me laugh every time. I don't know why. It's a bad joke. Somebody in chat said it,
[741.32s -> 758.36s]  but it's funny. All right, that's my inventory. Where's my health? Is there no HUD until I need
[758.36s -> 766.74s]  it? This game feels amazing to play, by the way. If you haven't got it, I would suggest you do.
[766.74s -> 773.11s]  Wait until you decide if it's worth it or not. That's what we do here on Friday Gaming Vibes.
[773.11s -> 779.16s]  We check it out. We see if it's worth your dollar. Is Call to the Lamb worth you opening up your
[779.16s -> 799.32s]  wallet? Stay tuned and find out on Friday Gaming Vibes. Money, money, money, one coin.
[800.04s -> 808.36s]  It is yet. It is. I haven't bought it yet. I'm really excited. I'm a huge Finding of Isaac fan.
[808.36s -> 813.72s]  You guys all know that. So and there's been a lot of those kind of Isaac likes, I would call them.
[814.36s -> 821.98s]  There's been quite a few. I never really got into any of the other ones besides Isaac.
[822.78s -> 828.12s]  We've nearly reached safety, but look ahead. Another poor soul about to be sacrificed.
[828.84s -> 832.28s]  Rescue them and they would have no choice but to join your new cult. I remember this.
[833.37s -> 837.05s]  Almighty bishops of the old faith, we ask you to accept the sacrifice of this wretched soul.
[837.77s -> 840.81s]  Who interrupts our ritual and trespasses on sacred ground?
[843.58s -> 860.78s]  Is there a charge? Can I hold down? Probably not. Nice. This is a Morty like.
[866.46s -> 871.34s]  Hey, you know that that I think they're coming to multiverses at some point here soon.
[872.66s -> 878.30s]  So what if I play as Morty? Will you guys all leave? What if I play as Rick and Morty in
[878.30s -> 882.38s]  multiverse? What if it's like my K? What if it's a character that I just connect with?
[882.38s -> 886.30s]  And I'm really good with it. It's really my style. Play, play, play through style and everything.
[886.30s -> 895.08s]  Right. You're going to have to suffer or you won't, but you can just leave if you want to.
[895.80s -> 902.14s]  We've reached safety. You have done well. Red Crown will allow you to use those markings
[902.14s -> 905.98s]  in the ground to transport yourself great distances. We'll take you to a temple that
[905.98s -> 911.10s]  has fallen to ruin there. You'll be able to begin your new cult. I'll meet you there.
[912.87s -> 916.52s]  I don't think you guys would leave. I think a lot of you guys are full of shit.
[916.52s -> 922.07s]  I don't think you'd leave. You'd say you were leaving and just so like, in case the mods
[922.07s -> 927.99s]  wanted to see like check, you would leave the chat. You'd hit the X window and then open a
[927.99s -> 932.01s]  private browsing tab and come back. Just so you could tell your friends that you weren't there.
[932.01s -> 935.61s]  Right. Like, nah, when he, when he was playing like his Rick and Morty was pissed me off.
[935.69s -> 950.97s]  I left. You can check the logs I was in there. All right, cool. So now we do the town building
[950.97s -> 961.24s]  section. This was in the demo. Please select the difficulty and where you can change. OK,
[963.72s -> 970.71s]  so as a as a seasoned binding of Isaac veteran, is this is this a medium or a hard game? What
[970.71s -> 986.30s]  should I do? No one's picking this medium sounds fine, right? It's two buttons, dude. But somebody
[986.30s -> 992.70s]  had an actual like a good take here. Reviews say the game is is easy. So pick a harder one.
[992.70s -> 1007.94s]  Do you is that as accurate? I don't want to know. Not very hard. Extra hard is not that bad. I'll
[1007.94s -> 1014.10s]  start with hard. We'll go from there if I want to. I can up it at any time or I can lower it if I
[1014.10s -> 1024.74s]  need to. All right, let's go. OK. This crumbling ruin is said to be the site of your new cult.
[1027.67s -> 1032.31s]  We have much to do. We begin by indoctrinating this poor soul into the warm embrace of your cult.
[1033.27s -> 1043.98s]  They get resources for you. Order this one to collect wood and stone. Come here.
[1045.74s -> 1057.29s]  Convert me to your cult. I will follow your teachings faithfully. All right, name. No,
[1057.93s -> 1062.49s]  no, no. Wait, I can just make it whatever I want, right? All right. How about, um,
[1062.49s -> 1086.18s]  aren't you, um, do Twitch integration? I think I'm not going to do it initially because I think
[1086.18s -> 1090.26s]  that it's they having problems with it. They took it offline for a little bit, right? And it's like
[1090.26s -> 1095.48s]  really slow. I'm definitely going to play this game more than once. I guarantee it. So we'll
[1095.48s -> 1114.55s]  turn it on another time. Uh, how about Bun Bun Bun Bob? I'm not going to name the character Morty
[1114.55s -> 1129.18s]  Bun Bob Sponge Bob. Yeah, Bun Bob choose form. Oh, oh, wait, wait. I got these because I got
[1129.18s -> 1147.50s]  the deluxe edition, right? Well, they can't be Bun Bob if they're not a bunny. That doesn't make
[1147.50s -> 1173.82s]  any sense. OK. OK. Variant. Yep. Freights on recruiting this follower immediately gain 10
[1173.82s -> 1186.86s]  faith and generates devotion 15 percent slower. All right. That's my first one. Whatever. All
[1186.86s -> 1197.82s]  right. So go collect, um, get wood. OK. Your cult will grow powerful, but your followers cannot live
[1197.82s -> 1204.41s]  on prayer alone that you need to eat. Gather necessary roots to build a cooking fire. Let's
[1204.41s -> 1209.05s]  you do meals. All right. Cool. So I need to collect. OK, let's go. I didn't chop trees down
[1209.05s -> 1225.46s]  like this. Germa, you're wormy. What do you know about me? You don't know me. You don't know me.
[1225.86s -> 1231.40s]  So don't say stuff like that. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do I know you? Do I know you?
[1232.36s -> 1250.33s]  Excuse me. It's going to take way too long. All right. Look at all this shit to build. What?
[1250.97s -> 1256.10s]  There's a lot of stuff here. I don't want to mess this up. I don't want to mess. I don't
[1256.10s -> 1263.58s]  want to mess this up like I messed up my cookie run kingdom town. OK. I had a terrible, awful,
[1263.58s -> 1273.03s]  awful layout for that and I uninstalled it. Uh, it should probably be down here down here.
[1277.51s -> 1293.96s]  No, that's too far away. Um, right here is OK. I'll clear this out. iPad, kid. You can move
[1293.96s -> 1299.21s]  things freely. OK. All right. So they need to eat. Hunger of your cult can be seen at the top left
[1299.21s -> 1303.45s]  of the screen. When this gets too low, followers will begin to starve. I don't want that. Find more
[1303.45s -> 1309.45s]  food while crusading. Grouts that pass through foraging. All right. Plant farms to grow your
[1309.45s -> 1318.17s]  own food. Seeds can be purchased or found while crusading. OK, cool. They'll collect some berry
[1318.17s -> 1336.55s]  meat and then cook a meal. They plant the berry seeds. I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of this game.
[1336.55s -> 1344.73s]  I don't think I'm going to move on like such a small, like low attention span. Like you won't
[1344.73s -> 1364.30s]  even do this little part here. OK, let's go. Cool. Now we must build a shrine. We need more
[1364.30s -> 1371.18s]  followers and more gold. Go crusade. Our mutual benefactor, the one who waits, has been trapped by
[1371.18s -> 1375.82s]  the four bishops of the old faith. Each of them guards a chain that binds him to the realm beyond.
[1377.18s -> 1380.62s]  We've conjured openings to their realms that is your task to track them down and slay them
[1381.34s -> 1388.22s]  so that he may be freed. Now go. There you shall find gold and willing recruits. And for those who
[1388.22s -> 1399.75s]  are not willing, convert them by force. Go. No, this game's fucking amazing.
[1400.47s -> 1405.46s]  Followers deposit resources here. OK, cool. Do I have to do anything with this person?
[1406.84s -> 1413.56s]  They just. Oh, wait, I can speak to Bunbob. Make demands. I'll figure that out later.
[1414.20s -> 1432.38s]  Dude, spoiler for season six. Rick and Morty. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, I forgot.
[1433.27s -> 1438.97s]  OK, Jerry. I'm sorry I said that earlier. I know that like a lot of people were upset that I
[1438.97s -> 1458.62s]  spoiled season six. All right. Darkwood. Cool. So this for place to go. What are you doing?
[1462.71s -> 1476.01s]  What was that? Godly blood was spilled here to death. No longer wish to wait. OK, let's go.
[1479.61s -> 1483.37s]  Don't make this a Rick and Morty joke stream. It deserves better. I won't.
[1485.42s -> 1488.46s]  It's not I. I'm reacting to chat right now. It's nothing to do with me.
[1489.26s -> 1504.17s]  OK, cool. Well balanced blade dealing moderate damage. I didn't enter the lands of the bishop
[1504.17s -> 1508.33s]  Leshy. Those who do not follow the ways of the old faith will be destroyed.
[1508.41s -> 1517.85s]  Let's go. We need more gold and we need more followers. Oh, should I have health now? All
[1517.85s -> 1535.14s]  right. Don't mess it up. We're good. Three coins and some hearts. You're more of a family guy
[1535.14s -> 1548.46s]  streamer. Um, I don't know. Am I going to Luigi's Mansion this game? Am I going to cut literally
[1548.46s -> 1572.01s]  everything down and not some of the slowest player of this game? Meow. You will get stuff if you do,
[1572.01s -> 1577.80s]  but it's not a constant drop. So it's worth doing. So I should keep doing it. I'll keep doing it.
[1578.04s -> 1585.21s]  It's me stuff. Somebody said you're like something like the Sopranos. All right. Is this
[1585.21s -> 1589.13s]  stream more like the Sopranos? Am I the Sopranos of Twitch or am I the family guy streamer?
[1603.24s -> 1610.86s]  You're the George Lopez of Twitch. I don't know what that means.
[1610.86s -> 1619.77s]  Is that an insult or is that like a good thing? Do people like George Lopez?
[1620.49s -> 1635.62s]  I thought George Lopez is as like a TV show and as a comedian, right? I'm going to go this way.
[1635.62s -> 1643.70s]  You're the Big Bang Theory of Twitch. No, I am not. No, I'm not. That's absolute horseshit and
[1643.70s -> 1653.40s]  you know it. You just said that to make me mad. The card showed me once many lifetimes ago,
[1653.40s -> 1657.34s]  or is it yet to be? I've always drawn your cards, lamb. And yet this is the first.
[1657.98s -> 1676.42s]  You're the young Sheldon of Twitch. Okay. Take these cards and I will grant. I will draw another
[1676.42s -> 1681.96s]  each time we meet. When drawn by me, they will grant you a power. Power? Well, that's both known
[1681.96s -> 1688.76s]  and unknown. The cards will decide that. Okay. A heart offered, a vow made or receive double
[1688.76s -> 1696.14s]  the health when healing. What is this one? Is that a spirit heart? Why would I be the Big Bang Theory?
[1698.55s -> 1705.50s]  Nothing I say. None of the jokes I make are Big Bang Theory kind of jokes. When was the last time
[1705.50s -> 1711.72s]  you heard me talk about a like physicist joke or like a joke about the cosmos or something or like
[1711.72s -> 1717.59s]  a math joke? I don't make those here. I don't ever talk about that stuff. I hate that stuff.
[1720.14s -> 1737.29s]  All those topics I dislike. Is this a spirit heart? No. Yes. I'll take double the health.
[1737.29s -> 1748.01s]  That sounds better. You hate the cosmos. No, I'm talking about like math jokes. I don't,
[1748.01s -> 1756.52s]  I don't, I'm not a math person. All right. Goodbye. I think you're more the Frazier of Twitch.
[1759.35s -> 1767.02s]  No, I don't think so. No, no, no, no. That's incorrect. I don't want to die in the tutorial
[1767.10s -> 1799.83s]  zone. What do you mean true? Isn't Frazier like super intellectual and, all right, there we go.
[1799.83s -> 1805.58s]  I need health. Wired feather necklace imbued with the vitality of a bird.
[1805.58s -> 1813.14s]  Follower will have increased movement speed. Okay. Are these permanent? I don't have a follower
[1813.14s -> 1836.97s]  though. I have no health. Can I eat this? What if I, I'm going to die here. Let's get more food.
[1837.45s -> 1846.47s]  Is this medium? This is no, it's not hard. Oh, okay. It's a lot of vegetables here.
[1847.19s -> 1853.59s]  Oh, this is perfect. Okay. Oh, this is perfect. Oh, let me say this. Oh, this is, oh, oh,
[1854.57s -> 1879.37s]  sentence. Oh, sentence. You're the Lunchables of Twitch. Incredibly convenient. Tastes great
[1880.71s -> 1899.78s]  and can fit anywhere. Um, okay. That's, I'm very versatile. How did I not find any health?
[1902.46s -> 1907.58s]  No, I'm not saying that's what me directly. I'm just saying that in general, Lunchables are very
[1907.58s -> 1911.50s]  convenient. They, they, they, they don't, they don't taste bad. They're fine. And they can,
[1911.50s -> 1916.38s]  you can take them anywhere and nobody complains. If you, okay, I'm going to tell you right now,
[1917.34s -> 1923.50s]  if I were to be in a room, like a conference room with like 10 executives, it doesn't matter.
[1923.50s -> 1927.90s]  Like 10, like multi-billion dollar executives. And they're talking about, oh, this is what we're
[1927.90s -> 1930.78s]  going to do. This is, this is, these are the expensive cigars and cigarettes. We're going
[1930.78s -> 1936.78s]  to smoke later. Oh, was that a 10,000 year old Scotch? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. What year is that one,
[1936.78s -> 1945.66s]  John? If I was in that room and I pulled out a Lunchables and I opened it, everyone would hear
[1945.66s -> 1950.54s]  the tear and they would, everyone would fucking be obsessed with it. Everyone would want a piece.
[1950.54s -> 1958.22s]  They, they would all go, wow, you got Lunchables. Oh, sick. Everyone would be so happy. It doesn't
[1958.22s -> 1966.89s]  matter. Everybody loves Lunchables. And then one of the executives that do, oh shit, dude,
[1966.89s -> 1972.33s]  what a fucking psycho. He would be like, let me see, give me, give me. He would take the cracker,
[1972.33s -> 1978.09s]  ham, cheese, cracker, ham, cheese, cracker, ham, cheese, cracker. And everyone around him,
[1978.09s -> 1981.37s]  everyone's going to be like, dude, slow down, dude. Oh, he's going fucking crazy.
[1981.93s -> 1984.65s]  And he would try to get the whole thing in his mouth and we would all clap and laugh.
[1994.68s -> 2002.68s]  I don't know. I need help. You did that on stream like eight years ago. Did I do a
[2002.68s -> 2032.02s]  Lunchables stack? No, I didn't. I did. I literally did. What? Hold on. Was this Lunchables though?
[2032.02s -> 2048.76s]  You can't go in like that. Hold on a second. I think you can go inside.
[2054.25s -> 2074.18s]  Man is going to choke on stream. Stop. Why do I have no emotion doing this? What's wrong with me?
[2083.02s -> 2098.92s]  Here, give that to me. He doesn't take it out of my mouth, does he? Oh, well, that was,
[2098.92s -> 2101.90s]  that was actually like, if you're going to throw up your face, that was like,
[2101.90s -> 2107.96s]  I'm moving weirdly enough where it's going to come up. You can't go in like that.
[2107.96s -> 2111.32s]  I think you can go inside. Are they Oreos? Why would I do it
[2111.32s -> 2118.14s]  long ways by the way? What the fuck was I doing? That's amateur move right there. That was amateur.
[2118.14s -> 2126.41s]  What an amateur. You don't do it long ways. You do it, you move vertical. What are you doing?
[2126.41s -> 2146.04s]  What an idiot. I forgot where I would play. Whatever. It's fine. I forgot where I was.
[2150.50s -> 2158.12s]  All right. Fear not. Hold on a second. Let me move this back where it was. Okay.
[2158.12s -> 2164.62s]  I should allow fire still need you. Take what you have gathered, build and strengthen the cult.
[2164.62s -> 2169.18s]  This is how power is gained. Continue on undaunted. Each time you are brought down,
[2169.18s -> 2177.48s]  you rise stronger. You included the Oreos. I don't know. I don't know why I did that.
[2180.60s -> 2189.18s]  We were drinking. We were downing beers. That stream. Oh yeah. But still, why would you go
[2189.18s -> 2197.37s]  like horizontal? It's vertical. Okay. So I have, um, I make some more food. I don't have any
[2197.37s -> 2205.37s]  followers. So what else can I build? All right. I just gotta get back in there.
[2206.01s -> 2219.66s]  Should I cook more food? What do you guys think? 15% chance of pooping instantly. Um,
[2225.86s -> 2231.75s]  can I eat these? No, I can't. So they'll just be, he can just eat it whenever he wants.
[2236.26s -> 2241.54s]  Food will spoil by the way. Oh shit. Okay. Pop left to see how hungry. Okay. Well,
[2241.54s -> 2252.39s]  it's all right. All right. Let's go. Why run out of room in my inventory? Or is it infinite?
[2253.03s -> 2268.95s]  No. All right. Sick. That's a new weapon. Apostates cleaver. High damage and a little slower.
[2269.67s -> 2287.24s]  That is slow. This is a good weapon. This is an ungodly weapon.
[2295.43s -> 2315.34s]  Ooh, this is actually kind of fun. Regular sword is better. This thing has huge cleave though.
[2316.06s -> 2342.57s]  The small rooms. This is great. Don't hit me. Nice. Yeah. There are secret rooms,
[2342.57s -> 2359.72s]  tinted rocks, tinted rock secret areas, right? There probably has to be. The cleave is so huge.
[2360.44s -> 2375.32s]  What happened? What's going on? How can this be? You were put to the blade, lamb, as all your kind
[2375.32s -> 2383.53s]  were. And yet here you stand before me unrepentant. Crown his power. Could it be? But I am stronger
[2383.53s -> 2392.38s]  still. Turn tail and run little lamb. Mini boss? No, I think that's the main boss of the act.
[2395.45s -> 2403.05s]  All right. What do you got? Overall weapon damage increased by 1.2 times.
[2407.30s -> 2412.18s]  Almost as much as the Wii was stronger than the GameCube. Remember that? You guys remember
[2412.18s -> 2420.22s]  hearing that? And how much that pissed everybody off initially? The Wii was 1.2 times faster than
[2420.22s -> 2426.58s]  the GameCube. And people were like, what? And then it sold like 100 million units. I remember
[2426.58s -> 2429.78s]  reading that initial report and being like, you got to be fucking kidding me, Nintendo. What are
[2429.78s -> 2436.55s]  you doing? Mistake flop. Things going to be a piece of shit. And I think like, like a third
[2436.55s -> 2447.05s]  of all households on earth own a Wii. So I was wrong. Yeah, it's definitely worth that.
[2447.05s -> 2464.38s]  More damage. Hell yeah. Let's not get hit. Okay. And statue of the mighty lamb. Oh, cool. Okay.
[2465.18s -> 2481.46s]  I need a temple. Did it? That's cool. So this is just decoration. Are you ever right?
[2482.55s -> 2491.62s]  Okay. I was right about Bitcoin. I bought Bitcoin when it was a dollar and I sold it when it got to
[2491.62s -> 2506.07s]  a dollar too. All of it. So, you know, I was right about that, I guess. Thanks for the fucking
[2506.07s -> 2523.34s]  reminder. Always bet against Jerma. No, why would you? Excuse me. Don't ever bet against Jerma.
[2523.98s -> 2529.98s]  Don't ever bet against me. Cause you know what? I might surprise you. Hey, I might surprise you
[2529.98s -> 2536.76s]  today. You know what? I kind of want a compilation of all the times I've done something and said,
[2536.76s -> 2542.25s]  you know what? I think I might surprise some of you guys today. And then just show the me walking
[2542.25s -> 2571.85s]  into grenades and stuff. That damage is awesome. You're predictable. Um, I feel like I'm some
[2571.85s -> 2578.54s]  things I am, but a lot of things I'm not. Like if I was so predictable, when's the next time
[2578.54s -> 2583.70s]  I'm going to tweet. That's not a I'm live tweet. You know what I'm saying? Like when am I going to
[2583.70s -> 2606.44s]  tweet again for real? Go ahead and predict that thing is doing a lot of damage. Whoa.
[2607.67s -> 2628.49s]  Ooh. Crusaders blade too. Oh, let me try it out. It's faster, but do I want it? I don't think it's
[2628.49s -> 2657.45s]  worth it. Yeah, I'm keeping the act. That guy. You come far enough. My followers are willing to do
[2657.45s -> 2662.79s]  anything for me. Can you say the same of yours? I give myself to the cause. Oh, mighty leader.
[2663.43s -> 2684.84s]  By the blood of the great ones, destroy the red crown. I'm who see us. Whoa. Don't get overwhelmed.
[2703.37s -> 2712.26s]  Oh, now you're going to be my follower, right? Please spare me. Convert me to your call. I will
[2712.26s -> 2726.33s]  follow your teachings. Come here. And then eight, not eight, six berry bush seeds, 16 berries.
[2727.64s -> 2740.02s]  Um, I don't know what's better. Just the regular berries and, oh, that's a lot of money.
[2740.74s -> 2758.31s]  Nice. Very cool. You should have taken the seeds. Oh, well, I want to say, let me check this seeds.
[2758.31s -> 2773.82s]  Grow the berries. You goofy ass. Let it came down here. Hmm. I feel like this would be worth it.
[2773.82s -> 2800.12s]  If it was too goofy. Oh, I said goofy ass. What are you going to lose these? Uh, what mods? What's
[2800.12s -> 2808.52s]  going on? What am I missing here? Anybody in mod chat? What's what am I missing? What's going on?
[2809.16s -> 2826.82s]  It's a meme. They say, lol, I don't know. What? Uh, no clue. I'm lost. I'm just as lost as you are.
[2829.85s -> 2849.61s]  Actually goofy. Uh, don't tell them. Is it? I don't get it. What? It's a meme. It's a current meme.
[2850.25s -> 2869.00s]  All right, let's go for it. It's time to win. Wait, I can return to, oh, it's locked. Why is it locked?
[2869.48s -> 2895.02s]  Did I do everything? Oh, okay. Cool. Boomer doesn't realize his chat is all under 25.
[2895.74s -> 2910.50s]  Oh, okay. All right. Very good. My vessel. It seems I chose well when I kept you from death.
[2911.14s -> 2924.79s]  I'll be watching your every move. Do not disappoint me. Your viewer base is five to 10 at this point.
[2924.79s -> 2939.54s]  Nobody that's five to 10 years old is on Twitch. I'm sorry. I don't agree. That's no, that no, no,
[2939.54s -> 2943.62s]  no. That's not even, that's not even Fortnite guys. That's not Fortnite age. Stop saying Fortnite.
[2945.16s -> 2958.98s]  No, maybe if you said like 12 or something, that's not Fortnite. Nope. You know how I,
[2958.98s -> 2967.22s]  I am certain I am 1 million percent positive that because so I have nieces and nephews and I can
[2967.22s -> 2972.02s]  tell like what that whole age group cares about just based on the things that my siblings tell me
[2972.02s -> 2977.29s]  and things that I see my nieces and nephews do. I know what they're into now. And I'll tell you,
[2977.29s -> 2991.77s]  it's not, it's not Twitch. When you have five, it's not, you're not on Twitch.
[3000.92s -> 3019.05s]  All right. Let's bring this new person in. Please spare me. Anecdote Andy. Dude, when you,
[3019.05s -> 3025.86s]  I'm trying to think of like the world when you're five, you can't even fucking read at five.
[3027.64s -> 3036.22s]  You can't even read. What are you talking about? You just barely are like learning how to read
[3037.67s -> 3043.99s]  at like four years old, five years old. You're not like reading books. You could. Yeah. All right.
[3043.99s -> 3049.16s]  Sorry. All right. Yeah. Sam, I am. I do not like green eggs and ham. They're not sitting here
[3049.16s -> 3055.14s]  typing like omega low. Like streamers sucks in the chat. They're not here. They're not writing
[3055.14s -> 3072.63s]  like copy pasta paragraphs here. It's not how it works. All right. What do I want this person to
[3072.63s -> 3115.27s]  be named? How about green? Um, wart, rash, puke, punk, oil. Um, gremlin, gremel, gremel, gremel,
[3115.27s -> 3131.77s]  gremel, gremel, gremel, grimace. No, you can stay there. Uh, I like the color is fine, but this is
[3131.77s -> 3150.15s]  bad. I just five, this person doesn't have any good traits. Um, you go get stoned because I already
[3150.15s -> 3155.26s]  have somebody cutting trees down. Followers will either work or worship. Worshipping followers
[3155.74s -> 3162.58s]  generate devotion for you to collect, but to collect it, you require a shrine, build it,
[3163.22s -> 3186.90s]  statue, shrine. Okay. Um, I can, I can have, I have to put it here. Let's work.
[3189.74s -> 3196.20s]  Praise be your followers can now worship you. There's a new follower. Assign them to worship
[3196.20s -> 3200.12s]  at the shrine and collect the devotion. Your followers generated the shrine to unlock divine
[3200.12s -> 3240.94s]  inspiration. Oh, new follower authority. I kind of like authority authority. The pig with the hair
[3240.94s -> 3248.06s]  on recruiting follower immediately lose 10 faith yields 15% faster when sickened and in bed rest.
[3248.94s -> 3264.12s]  Okay. Go worship. So you collect this more followers worshiping at your shrine, the faster
[3264.12s -> 3269.16s]  they will fill up. The shrine is full. They will be stopped until it is emptied. Once you've
[3269.16s -> 3273.08s]  collected divine inspiration, unlock new buildings. Ooh, that's how you do that. Okay. Cool.
[3273.96s -> 3283.10s]  Um, all of you actually go worship. I can do this bullshit. You know what I mean? I can do this.
[3283.66s -> 3295.46s]  You guys do that. I can't do that. Come here. Anybody have food? I'll finish this. You go do
[3295.46s -> 3312.44s]  that. All right. I need a temple. Who wants coffee? Oh, there's still food here. That's fine.
[3312.44s -> 3329.48s]  All right. We're good. Oh, it wants me to finish this part. Okay. Take it. Divine inspiration
[3329.48s -> 3340.14s]  unlocked. Um, my God. Okay. Just turn in the path of exile. So what do I want to go from here?
[3341.16s -> 3357.30s]  Sleeping bags. Unlock. Oh, establish a temple. All right. Farm plot or sleeping. Probably farm.
[3357.30s -> 3375.06s]  Yeah. Farm plot. I need some divine inspiration. Temple. Uh, this will go down. Let's put it away.
[3375.06s -> 3394.54s]  Like down here. The music slaps. It does. Yeah. It is pretty good. Why are you ignoring chat?
[3394.54s -> 3401.24s]  Who said I've been doing that? Like on the right stick. Your Twitch integration. No.
[3404.47s -> 3407.91s]  Temple is center of your cult. From there, you will preach sermons to grow stronger and
[3407.91s -> 3415.37s]  perform rituals to mold the fragile minds of your followers. You need to maintain the faith of your
[3415.37s -> 3420.62s]  cult. If it falls too low, your followers will dissent against you and eventually leave. They're
[3420.62s -> 3424.14s]  ready to hear your word. Show them that you are their great leader. Preach a sermon.
[3427.14s -> 3434.81s]  Oh, okay. All right. Everyone come on here. I'm going to give you a classic Bart Simpson.
[3438.82s -> 3448.97s]  Rub it up, Deb. Thanks for the grub. Bart! Oh Homer, it's okay. Okay. Perform a sermon.
[3449.53s -> 3453.51s]  Drawing energy from your followers to bolster the power of the red crown.
[3459.91s -> 3466.90s]  Oh, stop. Give me a break. It wasn't the impression I was trying to do. It was the
[3466.98s -> 3472.20s]  cadence I was doing and the nostalgia of you remembering the episode. That's it. I wasn't
[3472.20s -> 3476.44s]  being like, okay, here comes my good impression of Homer and Bart and Marge. No, that was a
[3476.44s -> 3480.57s]  cadence for you to remember the nostalgic properties of the episode. Now you're going
[3480.57s -> 3498.68s]  to get timed out if you keep this up. They liked it. Performing sermons will draw power from them
[3498.68s -> 3503.93s]  and allow you to unlock new abilities, weapons, and curses. Followers with a higher loyalty level
[3503.93s -> 3511.94s]  will generate more devotion. All right. So we have to do this a lot. Oh my God. There's more.
[3511.94s -> 3525.59s]  Oh shit. Nice. What's your favorite 10 commandment? Thou shalt not steal. Leave my shit alone.
[3528.54s -> 3540.47s]  Do it again. Okay. God your cult. You need to declare doctrine so that they might obey you.
[3542.18s -> 3546.10s]  Turn to the lands of the old faith and seek out commandment stone fragments. With these,
[3546.10s -> 3563.05s]  you'll be able to declare new doctrines. Okay. What about thou shalt not kill?
[3567.03s -> 3575.13s]  Thou shalt not steal is like the first one I thought of. What are the 10 commandments
[3575.13s -> 3581.66s]  off the top of my head? Let me see if I can get this. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal.
[3583.29s -> 3592.70s]  Thou don't, don't help me. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit
[3592.70s -> 3613.05s]  adultery. Right? Thou shalt not. What are the other ones? Only three commandments. No, no, no.
[3613.77s -> 3621.62s]  Okay. Mel Brooks had this joke and it was an unbelievable joke. He's playing as Moses,
[3621.62s -> 3625.96s]  right, with the commandments and he goes up to all the followers that are out there waiting to hear
[3625.96s -> 3629.48s]  him. He comes back with the boy. He has the commandments in his hands and he comes over
[3629.48s -> 3632.60s]  with these three big slabs and they're all waiting for him to talk and they're just like,
[3632.60s -> 3635.56s]  oh there he is, Moses. And he walks up with these three halves and he's like,
[3636.20s -> 3643.80s]  yes, I have seen God and we have spoken. What I have for you here, the most important I have.
[3643.80s -> 3648.76s]  And he drops one of the slabs and it fucking shatters on the ground. He says, I have 15.
[3648.76s -> 3655.98s]  The thing falls, it shatters on the ground. Then he goes, oh, 10 commandments. Can we watch it?
[3655.98s -> 3659.50s]  Let's watch it right now. It's a classic fucking piece of comedy. It really is.
[3662.73s -> 3673.53s]  Let's just watch it. How long is it? It's like 15 seconds long. It's so good. It's
[3673.53s -> 3677.78s]  truly like a genius bit. You can't go in like that. I think you can go inside.
[3684.30s -> 3704.34s]  Okay, here we go. It's so funny. I shall give these laws. Hear me. It's given unto you.
[3714.30s -> 3724.26s]  Oh, it's so good. Like what were the other five? What were the other five? Oh, it's classic.
[3729.11s -> 3739.40s]  Like those must have been important, right? All right, so now we plant.
[3741.61s -> 3750.63s]  The volume was too low. Oh, it's all right. Those are DLC. Yo, dude, when we're going to
[3750.63s -> 3770.39s]  get a baby food stream? You're weird. That's a weird thing to ask. Okay, I can plant.
[3771.51s -> 3780.74s]  I can do actually farming now, right? Okay. Oh, shit. It's a bunch of grass.
[3780.74s -> 3792.86s]  Wait. All right. The farm's going to be over here on the left. Put it in a diamond shape.
[3794.04s -> 3823.10s]  Oh, come on. I ruined it. Did I do too many? Do a baby food tier list.
[3823.10s -> 3825.74s]  I don't know, man. That's one of those ideas that starts out funny.
[3826.54s -> 3838.36s]  And then in practice is like, I'm not comfortable right now. Like the baby sensory stream. That's
[3838.36s -> 3843.00s]  a funny thing to think of and go, wow, that's funny to think about. But doing it in practice,
[3843.00s -> 3861.18s]  it's like, this is making me uncomfortable. Okay, so water. This is sick. You actually
[3861.18s -> 3875.00s]  have like a whole thing like this. All right, so then add fertilizer. Oh, I need shit.
[3875.64s -> 3894.26s]  Do they shit? Are they shitting? No, no, don't clean it. Pick it up on sanitary conditions
[3894.26s -> 3898.68s]  that your cult will cause your followers to get sick. If a follower becomes sick, assign them
[3898.68s -> 3905.85s]  to bed rest or they could die. Okay. OOP vomit and dead bodies cause illness to spread quickly
[3905.85s -> 3910.09s]  throughout your cult. Cleaning messes and burying bodies will prevent the spread of illness. Oh,
[3910.09s -> 3937.58s]  my God, what? That was weird. Like immediate. Disgusting. Okay, so I need more. All right,
[3937.58s -> 3949.88s]  this is fun. Well, let's keep going. Everyone can, everyone's good, right? I need a deadly
[3949.88s -> 3956.17s]  sins tier list. You mean like in order of which one I think is the worst or the, well, what do
[3956.17s -> 3987.93s]  you mean? Ooh, no, it needs to be by full metal alchemist characters. Oh, come on. FMA characters.
[3995.16s -> 3998.44s]  Okay, the one who waits is pleased with your progress and wishes to grant you a crown ability.
[4000.30s -> 4021.53s]  Thanks. Hmm. Ooh, so there's a, oh, it's perfect, right? Hit it right in the middle.
[4022.33s -> 4030.42s]  That's fun. Enemies you slay will now drop fervor. Collect this to replenish your curses.
[4031.14s -> 4036.78s]  All right. Righteous anger earned by striking down non-believers and works like ammunition
[4036.78s -> 4043.38s]  for your curses. Fervor will drop when you slay an enemy collecting it refuels your curses.
[4044.02s -> 4053.66s]  You ever heard about the Bible story where the kids bully a bald guy and they get mauled by a bear?
[4054.30s -> 4061.83s]  I can't say I've caught up with my Bible history or Bible verses in a long time, man.
[4063.53s -> 4100.62s]  Okay. Ooh, old nuggets. What's this? It's time of day matter. I probably shouldn't be using that
[4100.62s -> 4116.78s]  on these guys, right? Do you drink shower water? No. I open my mouth with the shower water go in,
[4116.78s -> 4122.78s]  fill my mouth enough where it overflows from inside. I just hold my mouth open and it goes,
[4122.78s -> 4126.70s]  fill, fill, fill, fill, fill, and then goes over the sides. And then I spit it all out.
[4140.38s -> 4150.38s]  Ow. Oh shit. Okay. These guys are weird. Oh my God. I'm getting destroyed in this one.
[4151.18s -> 4159.06s]  I have to pay more attention. All right. I got to pay attention. Pay more attention, please.
[4159.86s -> 4170.02s]  You have good tap water. No, I don't, I wouldn't, I don't know if I would drink
[4170.10s -> 4186.04s]  the Vegas tap water. No, I don't, I'm not, I'm not into that. Go down. What's up here?
[4188.30s -> 4192.89s]  Oh shit. Wait, go back, back, back. No, I don't want to go there yet. How do I get over there?
[4206.86s -> 4216.87s]  Use the map. Oh, it's not, okay. It's not connected. That's why. See how the little thing,
[4216.87s -> 4219.99s]  the little tag on the bottom is not connected. I thought for some reason I couldn't get that way.
[4220.63s -> 4231.34s]  Don't you have a filter? Yeah. Still, I wouldn't, I wouldn't just drink just regular tap water.
[4232.70s -> 4248.25s]  It freaks me out. It just does. I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't like, I don't know.
[4248.81s -> 4263.10s]  I don't like the way tap water smells. You know, when you put like tap water up to your mouth and
[4263.10s -> 4269.18s]  you kind of can smell that like chloriney kind of smell. No, it's like that. It's,
[4269.18s -> 4300.78s]  it's got a very specific smell to it. What is this? Go find out. Okay. Ooh. Okay. I only hit one of
[4300.78s -> 4308.74s]  them. Enjoy the rest of your dinner. Oh, I think I really hurt that guy. Okay. Salmon.
[4309.46s -> 4321.30s]  Berry seed. Let's do salmon. How much is this free? Is it free? Stop. Just how do I get him to stop
[4321.30s -> 4333.03s]  doing that? This is free. All this is free if I go in here and do this. Oops. I honestly did not
[4333.03s -> 4347.88s]  think that was anything alive. I thought that was just like a house. Okay. Cool. What's over here?
[4349.98s -> 4366.73s]  Whoa. Um, cool. This way. New follower. The worm it is hungry. It feeds. It partakes of our flesh,
[4366.73s -> 4378.33s]  but that is the price for safety for that. We gladly give it all we have. That's why these
[4378.33s -> 4385.93s]  guys were freaking me out because they, they do the, they do the fin from multiverses. Swing already.
[4385.93s -> 4424.74s]  Do it. Are there iframes? Can I dodge through people? Good. All right. What do you have for
[4424.74s -> 4433.93s]  magical powers? Cool. Find commandment stone fragments, which are there on the map somewhere?
[4435.05s -> 4458.73s]  Oh, there's meat. What are your current thoughts on multiverses? Give me that mic.
[4459.69s -> 4464.25s]  Here's what I think about multiverses. You already know what I think about multiverses. Don't ask.
[4478.41s -> 4509.03s]  Steal devotion. Sure. Okay. Break. Is it bad? Oh, champion. Champion. Foolishly persist little
[4509.03s -> 4514.71s]  lamb. I hear your lies and I smell your fear. The red frown rises again, but what an unworthy
[4514.71s -> 4533.19s]  bearer it has. Crack a quest. Oh, no, I don't want to do that right now. But it stumps too.
[4533.75s -> 4570.38s]  That's pretty cool. Oh, I thought I had power. Didn't roll. All right. That was funny.
[4571.70s -> 4577.30s]  When attacked 10% chance of negating damage or deals poison damage. Yeah. This one that's for
[4577.30s -> 4593.13s]  the fast swing should be cool, right? That power can probably change, I'm assuming, right?
[4593.77s -> 4605.66s]  This is a tablet fragment. We've been good. Give us face cam. All right.
[4607.75s -> 4611.27s]  Wow. I got more lighting in here and I look at how greasy and gross I look.
[4624.94s -> 4633.78s]  My hair looks like it came out of the oven and it's done. This looks like cooked hair.
[4636.97s -> 4645.02s]  My hair looked different. Like it's done now. It's ready. Okay. What befell this pantheon?
[4645.02s -> 4648.30s]  Alas, this is the nature of beasts to forget and of gods to be forgotten.
[4648.94s -> 4654.86s]  We'll get shiny. I should probably wash my face. Yeah, I'm going to wash my face after this.
[4655.42s -> 4659.78s]  All right. May have they left, may have they slept, may have they devoured and were devoured
[4659.78s -> 4663.70s]  in turn. Those few who remain spread roots, spun webs, molded this world to meet their men, theirs.
[4666.71s -> 4688.73s]  Many gods, hundreds. You found enough fragments to form a commandment stone.
[4689.94s -> 4692.82s]  These are used to declare new doctrines for your cult to follow.
[4693.70s -> 4698.58s]  Use the altar in your temple to declare a new doctrine so that I can change the sermons.
[4699.30s -> 4706.44s]  It's kind of cool. Cooked turkey hair. Don't you feel like if you just took a piece of this
[4706.44s -> 4713.75s]  off and like it would be delicious? All right. Whoa. One, two. And then he goes,
[4715.77s -> 4759.50s]  wow. One, two. And then he goes, oh, you idiot. I'll get greedy. It's four. You get four and that's
[4759.50s -> 4806.26s]  it. Oh, whoa. Four times. All right. Use the curse shot. Not enough time, man.
[4810.62s -> 4820.97s]  German name one more commitment or I'm going to stop watching. I'm actually going to try.
[4821.77s -> 4828.28s]  Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not
[4828.84s -> 4836.54s]  commit trespasses. Thou shalt forgive trespasses against us. Thou shalt. I actually really don't
[4836.54s -> 4862.39s]  know the ten of these. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not. Oh, it's not a bunch
[4862.39s -> 4869.19s]  of knots. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Right.
[4869.75s -> 4881.82s]  There's other things you can't you should do. Right. Thou shalt thou shalt eat a balanced
[4881.82s -> 4893.90s]  breakfast with at least one or two grams of whole grains. Thou shalt always thou shalt love thy
[4893.90s -> 4903.51s]  neighbor. Thou shalt drink water. Thou shalt drink eight ounces of water every two hours or something.
[4904.95s -> 4914.20s]  Thou shalt always bathe and never be on stream with a fucking cooked turkey hair. Did I get one?
[4916.68s -> 4922.44s]  That's too much water. I know that eight ounces of water every. You're supposed to eat eight
[4922.44s -> 4938.25s]  glasses of water a day. Right. Thou shalt thou shalt not too much. I don't know. Did I actually get
[4938.25s -> 4947.08s]  one? Thou shalt treat each other with respect or something along those lines. I'm just gonna look
[4947.08s -> 4974.31s]  them up. Okay. Ten commandments. How do I not know these? Ten commandments. Okay. Thou shalt not worship
[4974.31s -> 4983.61s]  false gods. I am the Lord your God. You shall have no other gods. Never take my name in vain. You shall
[4983.61s -> 4990.06s]  keep the Sabbath day holy. Honor your mother and father. You shalt not kill. You shalt not commit
[4990.06s -> 5006.76s]  adultery. You shall not steal. Okay so the other ones were I just I was thinking of um so honor
[5006.76s -> 5016.73s]  your father and mother. Hey I I always do I I say call your mother every day so I knew one. So I knew
[5016.73s -> 5031.90s]  it. Does that count? Okay so it's like don't have uh no false gods no other yeah I just I don't know
[5031.90s -> 5041.45s]  why I was thinking that they would like instable direct like you do not do this. Do this. Uh follower
[5041.45s -> 5052.98s]  form. Yeah I don't need batteries. Let's get a follower. Oh cool. Losing viewers. I'm not no
[5052.98s -> 5060.10s]  no I'm not you guys that you it doesn't even update that fast. Every time somebody says oh dude
[5060.10s -> 5064.82s]  you you blend like a thousand viewers. Dude it doesn't it updates like every two to three minutes.
[5066.10s -> 5085.35s]  You you don't know that. Hey guys let's leave. Let's all leave. Do you have a skincare routine?
[5085.35s -> 5090.63s]  I don't. Trust me you don't want to know it today because I didn't do anything. Just didn't take a
[5090.63s -> 5099.78s]  shower. I I probably should take a quick shower. Did I? Your faith is a resource spend it as you
[5099.78s -> 5102.98s]  would gold where you can always regain their trust with a well-placed gesture of kindness.
[5107.38s -> 5121.50s]  I give you power to read their minds. Okay so I can see what they want. You've declared a
[5121.50s -> 5134.26s]  doctrine which has granted you a new follower action. Okay take a quick shower but leave the
[5134.26s -> 5139.46s]  stream on. I might actually do that. Not right now but in a little bit before we do two point campus.
[5140.70s -> 5145.96s]  All right cool. How's everybody doing? It's it's kind of getting overgrown here isn't it?
[5146.76s -> 5152.52s]  You got a problem? Great leader the cult is growing by the day. It is time you gave it a name.
[5153.08s -> 5200.73s]  Sure my might. It's good to me. It's good to me. Oh water. Yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna take a shower
[5200.73s -> 5211.08s]  in between changing game. Is that weird? And on the BRB screen I'm just gonna put. Well I won't
[5211.08s -> 5222.90s]  spoil. Is that TOS? Can I do that? All right if I put just on the BRB screen just a running water
[5222.90s -> 5230.66s]  shower the kind of just like oh shower sound like and have just like stock audio of a guy going like
[5233.86s -> 5262.70s]  can I do that? Uh definitely sleep. So I can make beds now. How much does this cost?
[5263.34s -> 5286.09s]  These are expensive. I'll do three. Three is fine. What happened to your BRB art screen? Uh they were
[5286.09s -> 5291.82s]  thousands of images and more and more kept pouring in every week and we were never going to be able
[5291.82s -> 5300.39s]  to show them. And I only stream like two or three times a week. Not possible. Just was impossible.
[5301.03s -> 5322.52s]  It was physically not possible. Bunbob lives here. Rumble lives here. Yeah for those that don't know
[5322.52s -> 5329.05s]  I used to have a BRB art screen that would show like 10 to 20 pieces of art and we ran to the
[5329.05s -> 5337.85s]  problem where it was just we were months and months behind. So you would see images on that screen
[5337.85s -> 5342.49s]  from like a reference from like six months ago. And it got to the point where we had too many
[5343.13s -> 5349.05s]  where it was just never ever going to be physically ever possible. And I could have like the only way
[5349.05s -> 5354.25s]  I could have really caught up was if for like two or three straight days for like six to ten hours
[5354.25s -> 5360.47s]  for three four days just show a drawing on screen for five seconds. But why would I do that?
[5361.19s -> 5365.51s]  That just at that point that's just like showing it just to like get it over with.
[5366.62s -> 5372.10s]  I don't I don't want to do that. That would that just feels like well I don't want to do that.
[5376.73s -> 5382.49s]  So there's a there's a fan art channel in the discord that is tons of people use it. This is
[5382.49s -> 5393.45s]  a creative channel in the discord tons of people use it. That's where it is. What do you want? I'm
[5393.45s -> 5402.79s]  famished. We don't what do you mean you don't have food? What do you mean? How do you not have food?
[5405.54s -> 5412.18s]  Oh let's make some fish. How much is it making? All right yeah. Hey come get the fish and come
[5412.18s -> 5427.82s]  get some cool ingredients. Eat up. Go it's in front of you. The base is an eyesore. We need beauty to
[5427.82s -> 5439.70s]  celebrate your glory. Let us build decorations. Um okay fine. What do you got? Wow you did it truly
[5439.70s -> 5458.73s]  euro without flaw. I'm grateful. Okay oh wait. Should I do it again? I don't think I want to do
[5458.73s -> 5469.34s]  body pit yet. Farming bundle. Oh yeah hell yeah. I need another sleeping bag. Yeah that's true.
[5471.86s -> 5478.14s]  I have to recruit the new guy. Well hold on. I need to make sure he has a place to sleep.
[5495.50s -> 5533.82s]  Okay so you come on in. Convert me. Dimple. You can keep this for him. Okay so I want you to um
[5537.58s -> 5546.82s]  chop freeze but go to bed because who the fuck are you? I need another bed. Hold on. Where did
[5546.82s -> 5568.18s]  this person come from? Um I have sticks coming out of your head. Those sticks are those antlers.
[5568.74s -> 5589.51s]  Cool easy to level up but okay so we don't want this person ever doing uh faith or devotion stuff.
[5589.51s -> 5599.59s]  These names are lazy. Half the guys you want you want me to give the cool names to the people
[5599.59s -> 5610.74s]  that are going to die in like 40 minutes. Why would I do that? Wait wait wait you have a bed
[5610.74s -> 5625.83s]  over here. No no no I got it. I got it over here. This is yours. All right so do I have to sleep too
[5625.83s -> 5640.79s]  or do I not sleep? Okay uh decorations. They wanted some decorations. I'll put this one here.

[5696.10s -> 5707.75s]  he look so greasy? What's your problem? Okay read mind. Cult is a new building. Our glorious
[5707.75s -> 5716.68s]  cult grows. Okay bad chat. Boring. Must avoid them in the future. I agree. Good chat. I had
[5716.68s -> 5732.25s]  a great conversation with a fellow cult member. Okay rude. Somebody was rude to them in chat.
[5732.97s -> 5744.14s]  All right I need one more decoration. Is twitch integration? Yeah I know I'm not I don't have it
[5744.14s -> 5748.95s]  on. Last time somebody was talking about they said it's really slow and kind of bugged out
[5749.59s -> 5758.31s]  and they it's not like in a good spot right now apparently. We'll do it later. All right where's
[5758.31s -> 5770.74s]  Greml? Okay cool. Um dude I'm loving the Friday game vibes. Thanks. Hey welcome to the stream.
[5774.34s -> 5788.74s]  All right it's time. Everyone get in here. Uh we're gonna do crown. Okay I'm declaring. I declare
[5791.58s -> 5815.90s]  that um dance around the flame to increase the cult's faith. Oh yeah let's do it. Turn
[5816.14s -> 5829.90s]  off. Dude what the fuck dude? Turn off the giga chat filter. Fine. God damn it. So fuck it. I
[5829.90s -> 5866.25s]  didn't think people were gonna call me out on this but whatever. I'll turn it off. Nah I'm gonna keep
[5866.25s -> 5895.83s]  it on. I think it looked better with the sun don't you think? Why would I turn the filter off? Nah
[5895.83s -> 5905.48s]  keep it on. Even even if you know I don't really care. I like that I don't give a shit. All right
[5905.48s -> 5920.07s]  what is uh what are we doing? I need more. Were they were they not happy about something? 25 what
[5920.07s -> 5937.75s]  is that 25 what? Bones? Do a sermon. Oh I thought I thought there was a sermon. Oops okay.
[5941.80s -> 5952.04s]  Destroy their skeleton. Oh all right. Perform rituals in the temple. These usually raise faith
[5952.04s -> 5957.24s]  or help you solve problems. Rituals are performed using the bones of your fallen
[5957.24s -> 5966.12s]  enemies. Spiders. After slaying a non-believer dis-crate their bodies to gather their bones.
[5966.12s -> 5991.27s]  All right let's do a sermon though. Second. Bane weapons. Curse of three new curses will appear on
[5991.27s -> 6014.02s]  your yeah I'll see this. Cool. Please put on a different lego headpiece. I don't like this one.
[6014.02s -> 6034.07s]  Well now you don't get it at all. Okay looking good looking good. Uh cooking fire.
[6036.25s -> 6045.99s]  I need more. All right I gotta go on adventure. These ready? Oh shit they are ready. It destroys
[6045.99s -> 6062.86s]  the crop. Please we need cam. I'll put cam back on when I get back from the shower. How's that sound?
[6066.87s -> 6087.56s]  Please come back. No I I'm not I'm not gone. Please do Mr. Satan voice. I can do that
[6087.56s -> 6093.77s]  for a new follower of course I can. Well new followers. And make sure you say hi.
[6094.97s -> 6110.01s]  That person just followed. Every new follower I do that. All right I'm gonna I'm gonna go
[6110.01s -> 6124.52s]  adventure. Everybody happy? Uh I'm gonna make some food. Here if you're hungry you go ahead and eat
[6124.52s -> 6145.27s]  it. Foods up. Oh take a shower. I'm gonna take a shower. Relax. Who's this? You have so many
[6145.27s -> 6154.73s]  mouths to feed you must need some seeds. Okay. Okay I don't think I need it right now.
[6155.29s -> 6168.36s]  This game is awesome. This game is genuinely really fun. Whoa traders razor or hounds of
[6168.36s -> 6204.14s]  bait. Yeah. Oh I can take both? Wait oh I see. Oh camellia. Uh oh. So it is true the red crown
[6204.14s -> 6210.98s]  sits upon the brow of another. Ha we did everything we could. It matters not. We need not bother
[6210.98s -> 6223.78s]  Shamura with this. Deal with it brother. See come at. Whoa. All right stop being an idiot.
[6224.34s -> 6258.62s]  All right how do I get how do I do the bone thing? No no notice something about the game.
[6258.62s -> 6266.73s]  You can't mash. I guess maybe you can. You have to get the timing right to swing because if I go
[6266.73s -> 6274.82s]  like I guess it is that way. Okay I think you have to just like mash to keep it in succession
[6274.82s -> 6285.48s]  because if I don't mash it gets the combo gets caught. What about the bones? How do I do? Oh
[6285.48s -> 6294.12s]  you just break it. Okay and I didn't know if it was special. The game slows down when you connect
[6294.12s -> 6341.90s]  the hit. Match some shampoo into your hair. Okay. Oh nice. Hey I thought you I thought that was a
[6341.90s -> 6362.81s]  follower. I didn't think that was an enemy. You look like a retired porn star. Whatever you say.
[6363.45s -> 6380.89s]  Hi Mr. Raid automated. Thank you automated for the raid. Appreciate it. I don't know when that
[6380.89s -> 6393.59s]  was. I think it was a while ago. Welcome. Thank you auto. Poison damage nice. You left the heart.
[6393.59s -> 6414.26s]  I was looking at chat. I want to look at more stuff over here. I'll come back once I'm done
[6414.26s -> 6423.69s]  from the shower. 10% crit. Yeah although that's really good too. No I want the crit for sure.
[6425.56s -> 6454.04s]  More damage. Bones. I know I'm breaking everything. I'm taking so much longer.
[6454.84s -> 6463.51s]  Heard you shower every five years. Honestly I know people say like oh yeah I don't you know
[6463.51s -> 6469.59s]  I don't like wash my hair like all the time or once a week. If I do not take a shower every day
[6470.46s -> 6478.49s]  I am disgusting. Disgusting. I don't know. I must just be a gross person.
[6481.85s -> 6487.11s]  I'm so sweaty and greasy every day. If I do not take a shower every day
[6487.99s -> 6496.78s]  I am I am absolutely revolting to be around. I don't know maybe some people don't generate
[6496.78s -> 6531.83s]  as much filth as I do or something. Poison's great. Maybe it's your mayo and peanut butter diet.
[6532.47s -> 6547.42s]  Peanut butter is all right. I'm not going to listen to this slander. Peanut butter is really
[6547.42s -> 6553.78s]  good for you. It's so good for you. There's so many health benefits of just really good real
[6553.78s -> 6566.22s]  peanut butter. Get that get that slander out of this chat. Not if that's the only thing you eat.
[6569.02s -> 6572.54s]  I don't turn the stream off and go get a spoon and sit there and eat
[6572.54s -> 6579.03s]  crunchy peanut butter out of a jar and go that's it. Oh all of my nutrients. I'm not like Super
[6579.03s -> 6584.79s]  Mario. I don't just eat big mushrooms and then like go to that's not how it works.
[6584.79s -> 6595.99s]  It's not I don't have the Super Mario diet guys. It's not mushrooms and cake. The only thing Mario
[6595.99s -> 6601.99s]  eats in the entire series of Mario Brothers is the cake at the end and a bunch of mushrooms
[6603.06s -> 6608.22s]  and spaghetti. Yeah but that is that cannon though? I don't know if that's cannon.
[6615.16s -> 6640.01s]  Is it cannon? And he eats flowers too. You got some spaghetti on your overalls. Oh fuck you Luigi.
[6640.01s -> 6658.58s]  Yeah I've seen it. I think everyone's seen that video. Be honest are you actually Mario? Um no.
[6659.30s -> 6671.22s]  No. I don't have full health. You like partially hydrogenated or natural peanut butter.
[6672.65s -> 6678.73s]  They're I mean they they're natural good peanut butter where when you look at it
[6679.53s -> 6688.68s]  it's like watery on top. That's the good stuff. Now just a regular skippy peanut butter is so good
[6688.68s -> 6695.34s]  if you want. It's almost like a dessert peanut butter but the one with like the peanut oil on
[6695.34s -> 6707.67s]  the top it's oh man it is gold. That's gross. Yeah it's peanut oil. Skippy peanut butter is
[6707.67s -> 6716.73s]  is like a dessert peanut butter for me. Natural peanut butter with the oil that settles and you
[6716.73s -> 6721.53s]  have to mix it up a little bit or I'm telling you man sometimes I just scoop in there and I get
[6721.53s -> 6724.49s]  a bunch of the top layer oil and a little bit of the top layer of the peanut butter
[6725.05s -> 6735.96s]  and I eat it. It's delicious. Oh that's good and why is that gross somehow?
[6736.84s -> 6744.86s]  Yeah if you have a bag of Doritos on your desk in front of you right now sitting on your desk
[6744.86s -> 6750.07s]  you are not allowed to say oh that's gross. If you have if you look down if you're holding a
[6750.07s -> 6755.43s]  half empty bag of Doritos in your hand you do not say oh to me eating peanut butter with some peanut
[6755.43s -> 6761.96s]  oil on it. Let's get out of here with that. If you look down right now and your hand is covered in
[6761.96s -> 6781.30s]  fucking taki dust I don't want to hear shit about how I like peanut butter. It's not the same. What
[6782.98s -> 6796.82s]  what are you talking about? What about sushi? That's good. You drinking the oil. I'm not
[6798.42s -> 6804.17s]  I don't tip it up in like no I'm talking he's getting a little bit it's like a little test
[6804.17s -> 6811.05s]  it's a little tasting like that's it man it's not a big deal it's really not and it's way better
[6811.05s -> 6833.14s]  than the taki dust that's all over your fingers that one olive oil or butter they're both good
[6833.14s -> 6844.36s]  I mean olive oil is better I think but I don't put butter on that much stuff olive oil is better
[6856.54s -> 6863.10s]  yeah y'all just wait just wait when the when the apocalypse comes and and I'm and I'm the guy that
[6863.10s -> 6870.46s]  has like the 20 vats of peanut butter in his pantry you can live off that shit I'm gonna live
[6870.46s -> 6875.16s]  for a long time I'm gonna be sitting there people I'm gonna be trading peanut butter
[6875.72s -> 6900.62s]  for it's gonna be a commodity oh I don't envy you that's if I don't I'm kidding it's an old
[6900.62s -> 6918.62s]  routine old bit no it's not um I'll take this right what does recycle oh that's cool you've

[6932.71s -> 6940.55s]  the dictionary probably 50 times uh times 10 I've said two to three trillion words on camera
[6948.87s -> 6953.19s]  people will come to me like hey dude um do you know like what why did you say like seven years
[6953.19s -> 6957.51s]  ago um you said this in a video and I'm just kind of wondering like what your stance on that still
[6957.51s -> 6963.42s]  is just like I don't do I've said two trillion fucking sentences I don't know how fast you
[6963.42s -> 6968.38s]  should have asked me seven or eight years ago should ask me two months ago should ask me five
[6968.38s -> 7004.41s]  weeks ago I don't know what is this wait you're gonna eat this person do you run on pure instinct

[7124.02s -> 7135.77s]  I mean you the jar will be empty but it's not something that's like oh shit we're out of
[7135.77s -> 7149.56s]  peanut butter no it's it lasts a very very long time no it's not like the bullshit the
[7150.20s -> 7156.76s]  bullshit ice creams where they make they have a whole box and there's like two in the box
[7156.76s -> 7161.72s]  or like four in the whole box that's how you can look in there and be like somebody ate three of
[7161.72s -> 7184.23s]  these and I only had one not the same that one's good by the way I was that person I told you the
[7184.23s -> 7190.15s]  story about uh did I tell you guys that the twix ice cream bars or the note was snickers snickers
[7190.15s -> 7198.76s]  ice cream bars after I talked about that how um my brother used to get really pissed off at me
[7201.27s -> 7210.81s]  not just with snickers ice cream bars but with other very very valuable treats they would only
[7210.81s -> 7217.10s]  be like four or six in a box or something I think there was like four and hold on hold that thought
[7217.10s -> 7305.78s]  this is like a major fight attack him what are you doing man oh yeah okay so anyways
[7306.89s -> 7313.90s]  so I used to I love ice cream I love treats I need a little snack I loved it and in the house
[7313.90s -> 7319.34s]  there would always just be one box of like twix ice cream bars or snickers ice cream bars or
[7319.34s -> 7325.34s]  drumsticks whatever it was and I would always lie to my brother because I would I would go down
[7325.34s -> 7331.72s]  you could I could never eat just one of those I always ate two because they weren't it wasn't
[7331.72s -> 7338.70s]  enough those snickers ice cream bars were small so I would just be obsessed with it I would eat
[7338.70s -> 7344.60s]  the whole thing and it'd be like I'm I'm they I have to have another one so I'd eat two and then
[7344.60s -> 7353.58s]  like an hour later I heard one and my brother would not have one yet he would go to the box
[7353.90s -> 7361.19s]  one in the box he'd be like what are you doing Jeremy Jeremy you how many did you have
[7361.75s -> 7366.95s]  I'd be like what I had like one it was just lying and then he'd be like I know and he would go look
[7366.95s -> 7372.15s]  for wrappers he would go look for wrappers he'd be like oh yeah because I would leave that shit
[7372.15s -> 7376.07s]  on the desk and stuff or in my room whatever like and he would go be like oh yeah really
[7379.40s -> 7382.52s]  I was smart enough though I kept him in my fucking pocket what do you think I'm dumb
[7383.16s -> 7399.29s]  what do you always get so pissed uh let's see if they would I've said I obviously don't do that
[7399.29s -> 7408.79s]  anymore since I was like a teenager like I was I was like a young teenager I don't do that anymore
[7408.79s -> 7415.64s]  guys I don't really eat ice cream that much anymore I love ice cream but it's not I don't
[7415.64s -> 7433.10s]  really have that often it's so good though you do that with peanut butter no one is going to be
[7433.10s -> 7436.78s]  this thing but that's what I said it's not a peanut butter is not a high value treat
[7438.46s -> 7445.29s]  Quicks ice cream bars are incredibly high value my brother would not go into the pantry and be
[7445.29s -> 7450.97s]  like dude the peanut butter's half gone what the heck are you doing man peanut butter's gone
[7450.97s -> 7460.42s]  but no way that's not a high value treat that would never happen if peanut butter was half
[7460.42s -> 7471.80s]  gone one day or just be like whatever I don't care have jam or Nutella you sicko yeah I'm not
[7471.80s -> 7478.68s]  on the Nutella bullshit by the way I know Nutella whoa fuck Nutella no no peanut butter's better
