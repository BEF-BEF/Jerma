[235.35s -> 302.02s]  Welcome to Car Shield Field where we have German Baseball Association action for you
[302.02s -> 307.54s]  tonight. A big time matchup between the California Circus and the Maryland
[307.54s -> 314.78s]  Magicians. Maryland comes in at 27 and 22 the circus 11 games over 500. I'm joined
[314.78s -> 320.82s]  by former Phoenix caveman great Gary Grunt. I am Storm Williamson and Gary we
[320.82s -> 324.66s]  should have a big time great matchup on the field tonight. Yeah very good ball
[324.66s -> 329.06s]  clubs on the field here this evening Storm. We throw out the record books when
[329.06s -> 332.90s]  these two teams get together. They're just two vastly different ball clubs.
[332.90s -> 337.54s]  They win different ways. The circus is more of a clown show. They kind of try to
[337.54s -> 340.90s]  trick you into some different pitches whereas on the other side the Magicians
[340.90s -> 344.50s]  they win with their clever illusions. I'd like to see what the big tall
[344.50s -> 347.90s]  right-hander has on the mound here tonight. What kind of tricks they have up
[347.90s -> 351.62s]  their sleeve and of course the power cards will play a big part of tonight's
[351.62s -> 356.50s]  game. Get a look at Joy Hansome right now the manager of the Maryland Magicians.
[356.54s -> 362.22s]  He's guided his club to a five game over 500 mark so far this year and a coastal
[362.22s -> 366.66s]  clash these teams coming from across the country to meet tonight. There you get a
[366.66s -> 371.86s]  look at Fred Big Top the leader of the California Circus and don't let that
[371.86s -> 375.66s]  face fool you he has been plenty happy this year. We talked about that record of
[375.66s -> 381.98s]  30 and 19 for them on the year and we go from Big Top to Big Boy on the mound. Big
[381.98s -> 387.70s]  Boy Buckle gets the call for the circus. He has been outstanding all year long to
[387.70s -> 393.98s]  the tune of a 9 and 6 record 2.81 ERA. What are the Magicians going to have to
[393.98s -> 398.54s]  do to try to put a dent in what this man has done this year? Well for the the man
[398.54s -> 403.82s]  on the mound here tonight he's obviously a very dominant right-hander. Look for
[403.82s -> 407.94s]  the off-speed pitches to be really key to his arsenal tonight and on the other
[407.94s -> 411.66s]  side for the Magicians they just need to make contact. There's a lot of movement from
[411.66s -> 417.10s]  from Big Boy and we'll see what kind of contact they can make here tonight. So
[417.10s -> 421.02s]  Donald Strange will come to the plate the first batter for the Maryland
[421.02s -> 428.34s]  Magicians and the first pitch of our game just a little bit high and already
[428.34s -> 432.66s]  Chief Albertson having a word with our pitcher we've only gotten one pitch
[432.66s -> 436.14s]  through the game. Yeah he's gonna have to take care of that control problem he
[436.14s -> 439.26s]  needs to get that lower and over the plate or else the Magicians players
[439.26s -> 443.46s]  are gonna be in for a long night dipping and diving and trying to get out of the
[443.46s -> 447.75s]  way that some of these pitches. Crew chief Albertson you get a look at him
[447.75s -> 453.67s]  right there chief of the one-man crew tonight so doing a great job and maybe
[453.67s -> 458.35s]  not so great of a job on that call. Yeah questionable call there but Albertson
[458.35s -> 463.75s]  he's the crew chief tonight so what he says go what he says go and that ball
[463.75s -> 470.03s]  was maybe a little inside the plate. 258 hitting Donald Strange took a big rip at
[470.03s -> 473.43s]  that one couldn't quite connect and the count to one ball and two strikes now.
[473.43s -> 484.66s]  A big cut there from Strange playing for the Magicians third baseman tonight
[484.66s -> 491.20s]  playing the hot corner. Xavier McMagic awaits on deck here comes the next pitch
[491.20s -> 498.71s]  from Big Boy. Big Rock a couple of them make it three is the third a charm a hot
[498.71s -> 504.19s]  shot towards the hole at second base what a play and they rob him of a hit
[504.19s -> 509.11s]  outstanding from Paul Laffington no laughing matter on the middle infield.
[509.11s -> 512.99s]  Absolutely no laughing matter got over to his left got to the ball and then
[512.99s -> 518.31s]  great release from glove to arm to make that throw first out of the inning great
[518.31s -> 522.87s]  play going to his left. And Donald Strange had to be thinking look I've done my job
[522.87s -> 527.75s]  we've got a base hit to lead off this game uh-uh the circus who had some
[527.75s -> 531.47s]  trouble getting to this game tonight having no trouble getting settled in.
[531.47s -> 533.99s]  Yeah they had a lot of trouble apparently they put the wrong gas in the
[533.99s -> 538.03s]  car it was uh someone had put petroleum gas and they're looking for laughing gas.
[538.03s -> 545.05s]  Hold on hold on crew chief Albertson is down. Oh no we've seen some issues with
[545.05s -> 552.38s]  Albertson. And this is you know again we need to mention here a crew chief of one
[552.38s -> 557.42s]  so he's saying he's all right but but we'll have to see how he goes about this
[557.42s -> 560.42s]  moving on that could be a lingering injury. Yeah Albertson the only umpire
[560.42s -> 564.02s]  here tonight has to cover home plate first base second base third base the
[564.02s -> 569.02s]  outfield as well. Laffington charging in and he bubbles flips to the back
[569.02s -> 575.70s]  Albertson calls him out. Great play again there from the second baseman for the
[575.70s -> 583.98s]  circus. Seen some errant wands flying here and there and Albertson yells safe
[583.98s -> 588.18s]  into the dugout with the out signal and now all of a sudden coming out of the
[588.18s -> 593.93s]  dugout Joy Handsome has got some words. Yeah might have to go into the magic
[593.93s -> 598.45s]  spellbook here to figure out how to break this defense and get past the
[598.45s -> 605.89s]  adversity that the umpire and crew chief has created here so far. Joy back to the
[605.89s -> 611.85s]  bench and now we get our first look at Zeke Flash a couple of bounces in and
[611.85s -> 616.01s]  Albertson thinking about it but he will rule it ball one. That's what happens
[616.01s -> 618.81s]  here in the JBA sometimes a little cricket can bounce out you just never
[618.89s -> 623.19s]  know what's gonna happen. I want to thank all of you for tuning into the
[623.19s -> 628.61s]  Germa Baseball Association ripping a hot shot just foul past the third base bag
[628.61s -> 633.61s]  count to one and one now on Zeke Flash the shortstop for the Maryland
[633.61s -> 639.29s]  Magicians is hitting 246 on the year with a slugging percentage of 365.
[639.29s -> 644.85s]  Flash very capable of putting the ball over the seats we'll see what
[644.85s -> 650.43s]  kind of pitch he gets here. It's an interesting one from Buckle and kicking
[650.43s -> 654.11s]  his heel out it. Couldn't get a piece of it trying to get a board first base
[654.11s -> 658.43s]  with the hit by pitch but he can't come up with it. We don't expect
[658.43s -> 662.07s]  runs to be at a premium but if you can get on base any way you can stick a leg
[662.07s -> 666.71s]  foot anything wand anything you can get a baseball on. And we get a pop fly into
[666.71s -> 673.27s]  shallow right field moving towards right center the play is made by Lenny Munson
[673.27s -> 678.63s]  so one two three big boy Buckle great work in the top half of the first he
[678.63s -> 683.19s]  gets them in order the California Circus will come to the plate when we return
[683.19s -> 764.26s]  you're watching Germa Baseball Association. Welcome back to Car Shield
[764.26s -> 769.18s]  Field this is the Germa Baseball Association Maryland Magicians and the
[769.18s -> 774.98s]  California Circus through one half inning of play a one two three top half
[774.98s -> 779.78s]  of the first for big boy Buckle on the mound and now he gives way to Doug Dubb
[779.78s -> 783.78s]  the right-handed pitcher for the Maryland Magicians stands at five foot
[783.78s -> 787.70s]  nine a hundred sixty pounds we talked about that great record for big boy how
[787.70s -> 792.58s]  about an eight and three record for Doug Dubb. Yeah Doug Dubb known for pulling it
[792.58s -> 796.34s]  out the Dubb out of the hat can really fired in there with a fastball has a
[796.34s -> 801.50s]  good change up mixes in his pitches very nicely can also throw a four seam sinker
[801.50s -> 805.94s]  that sinks away from left-handed hitters and as well as cut into righties so
[805.94s -> 811.42s]  we'll see how Mr. Dubb handles his top half of the inning we saw relatively easy
[811.62s -> 817.62s]  inning for big boy in the first the top half of the first inning here we'll see
[817.62s -> 821.94s]  how Doug Dubb does here as you see his stats on the board 18 games pitched eight
[821.94s -> 826.26s]  and three record look at that strikeout to walk ratio as we mentioned the stuff
[826.26s -> 829.86s]  and the kind of creativity he has on the mound he can really smoke it by the
[829.86s -> 835.82s]  batter. And so now Hunter Sweets the leadoff man for the California Circus
[835.82s -> 840.18s]  he'll be followed by Percy Polkadot and then David Honk batting in the three
[840.18s -> 844.62s]  spot for the California Circus and Hunter Sweet has brought quite a bit of
[844.62s -> 850.02s]  power to the table on the season while only hitting 216 a 341 slug due to five
[850.02s -> 854.66s]  home runs and you saw crew chief Albertson taking a good look at that bat
[854.66s -> 858.42s]  prior maybe just to make sure hey is this thing corked what's going on here
[858.42s -> 863.02s]  yeah I can't have any illegal play here can't have a cork bat that wouldn't be
[863.02s -> 867.06s]  good it wouldn't level the playing field here tonight as Dubb fires it in there
[867.06s -> 873.00s]  as Doug has really been one of the top magicians in the JBA in terms of
[873.00s -> 879.46s]  pitching he really focuses on his craft. The Hocus Pocus on point two and one
[879.46s -> 885.99s]  with that swing and a miss get a look there at crew chief Albertson as Dubb
[885.99s -> 891.49s]  peers in for the next. Changing the wind up here trying to keep the hitter off
[891.49s -> 897.61s]  balance and does. Oh my goodness you talked about that heat hello. You can see
[897.61s -> 900.01s]  the two different styles of the pitchers we saw big boy a little bit
[900.01s -> 906.84s]  more crafty. Dubb here in the bottom half of the first just throwing gas. The Cape
[906.84s -> 914.12s]  Crusader hits him with the breaking ball and Sweets is down. Oh he's thinking
[914.12s -> 918.36s]  about it there goes the bat Dubb kicks it right back towards him and hitting in
[918.36s -> 922.04s]  between them Roy Flushman says hey fellas let's simmer it now we're only in
[922.04s -> 927.84s]  the first. Yeah don't let anything let cooler heads prevail here as Albertson
[927.84s -> 931.84s]  gives him the bases we'll get a replay on this you see the curveball just got
[931.84s -> 938.52s]  away from him it's him it's the batter in the left shoulder goes down. A great
[938.52s -> 942.76s]  time to point out that safety and security really important aspects in
[942.76s -> 946.28s]  every part of your life we have to deal with them on a daily basis and it can be
[946.28s -> 949.60s]  hard to find the right solutions wouldn't it be great if there was one
[949.60s -> 953.88s]  solution that gets rid of those problems most internet users aren't sure of the
[953.88s -> 958.20s]  amount of surveillance limitation and data mining done with their personal
[958.20s -> 962.72s]  information but surf shark can solve all of those problems for you that's surf
[962.72s -> 966.76s]  shark go ahead and check them out and make sure that your data is safe.
[966.76s -> 971.04s]  Polkadot taking a strike to begin this at bat runner over at first base is
[971.04s -> 974.32s]  Hunter Sweets after being hit by the pitch they check on him and he slides
[974.32s -> 981.86s]  back in safe. A great curveball thrown by Dubb there just went 12 to 6 no chance
[981.86s -> 986.14s]  for the hitter. So we saw the magicians go down in order first base runner of
[986.14s -> 992.46s]  this game Sweets over at first base a bit outside but did appear that her
[992.46s -> 996.78s]  chief Albertson called that a strike it's to Owen too and Polkadot wants to
[996.78s -> 1001.74s]  have an extra look back at Albertson as he yells towards the dugout of the
[1001.74s -> 1005.78s]  magicians. You got to keep the runner on as well so a lot dealing dealing with a lot
[1005.78s -> 1010.78s]  here this one's hit high and deep left side but that'll get foul. That ball was blasted.
[1010.78s -> 1025.02s]  Polkadot yes. Percy not playing get a look at that big red nose of his and he
[1025.02s -> 1030.34s]  was going to really really be happy if he could send that one over the fence a
[1030.34s -> 1036.64s]  good start here though for the California circus. Dubb turns and throws
[1036.64s -> 1041.32s]  the first base Sweets back in time again really keeping tabs on him. Yeah
[1041.32s -> 1044.20s]  absolutely don't want to give up a stalled base here still early on in the
[1044.20s -> 1050.11s]  game so runs out of premium and can't give up can't give them away here. Dubb's
[1050.11s -> 1054.55s]  pitch a breaking ball that is fouled away to the right side that will reach
[1054.55s -> 1060.48s]  the seats. Notice the equipment change from the Klanza I'm used to seeing them
[1060.48s -> 1064.80s]  and games pass for they've got you know bigger shoes on comically large shoes
[1064.80s -> 1069.00s]  they got normal shoes on here tonight so it could be another tactic implemented
[1069.00s -> 1073.16s]  by the managing staff to get some more wins for this California circus. And what
[1073.16s -> 1077.68s]  a job out of the circus dugout there you see great job running out those balls
[1077.68s -> 1083.08s]  to crew chief Albertson doing a great job himself behind home plate despite a
[1083.08s -> 1086.64s]  couple of controversial calls and that might be another one called out on
[1086.64s -> 1092.12s]  strikes. Polkadot the first out of the bottom of the first inning. Well Albertson's
[1092.12s -> 1095.36s]  been consistent with the zone so far he's calling him high he's calling him low
[1095.36s -> 1099.24s]  calling him outside and inside so consistency is the name of the game when
[1099.24s -> 1103.36s]  near the umpire and look at this one catches the outside corner. Great frame
[1103.36s -> 1107.40s]  job by the catcher. That's a great point that you make there I want to go back to
[1107.40s -> 1112.80s]  that though Gary a former great in this game how much does that consistency from
[1112.80s -> 1116.80s]  the umpire matter you know you know that any given pitch is going to be a strike
[1116.80s -> 1120.36s]  whether it is or not and that helps you out a lot as a batter. Yeah it keeps you
[1120.36s -> 1126.16s]  on your toes it really focuses you in on the the spin rate of the ball and you
[1126.20s -> 1132.58s]  really want to try to make contact as we have a stolen base attempt here. Hunter Sweets is out!
[1132.58s -> 1136.58s]  Albertson he took some time with it I thought he might pull out the safe call
[1136.58s -> 1142.26s]  but he does rule him out a stolen base caught stealing I should say on the
[1142.26s -> 1146.62s]  steal attempt from Hunter Sweets. Yeah not a great jump and a fantastic throw
[1146.62s -> 1152.27s]  down right into the glove of the second baseman there and the tag is applied and
[1152.27s -> 1159.62s]  the second out of the bottom of the half of the first inning here great throw.
[1159.66s -> 1164.10s]  Just like that two down Albertson having to keep both of these dugouts in check
[1164.10s -> 1169.74s]  early on a lot of jawing going on from both sides. Well the stakes are high here
[1169.74s -> 1175.69s]  Storm these teams need a victory. They need a victory and you know we're
[1175.69s -> 1179.53s]  talking about two of the best teams in this league as well we're getting closer
[1179.53s -> 1183.69s]  to postseason play and you want to be in the correct form when you go into
[1183.69s -> 1187.05s]  postseason play and we'll see if these teams can get back to the style of
[1187.05s -> 1191.21s]  baseball that we're used to seeing. Yeah jockeying for playoff positioning as
[1191.21s -> 1198.57s]  this one's in there for they call that a strike. Three one is the count. Yeah
[1198.57s -> 1201.37s]  games playing elsewhere the drunkards are playing the Mimes this evening as
[1201.37s -> 1205.17s]  well as the K-Band my former squad and the old ladies matched it up we'll have
[1205.17s -> 1208.77s]  crunch time after this to give us the full breakdown on all the highlights of
[1208.77s -> 1214.65s]  the JPA games that are happening this afternoon. And it goes into foul
[1214.69s -> 1221.37s]  territory. Should mention here you know we've got our standard defensive
[1221.37s -> 1225.69s]  alignment for the most part and a man on stilts out in left center for the
[1225.69s -> 1229.17s]  magicians you know that is your weapon one of those tricks that you can pull
[1229.17s -> 1233.01s]  out when you need it time and time again and against these right-handed batters
[1233.01s -> 1237.41s]  power hitters trying to put a gapper out there and score a run not today. Yeah
[1237.41s -> 1242.57s]  it's the JBA's version of almost of a defensive shift where they hit the man
[1242.57s -> 1247.37s]  and stilts out in left field again he can get those wall scrapers anything
[1247.37s -> 1251.89s]  going over that wall on that left side he can get to and track down. And what is
[1251.89s -> 1260.19s]  this? They called it a strike in David Honk. He got the umpire got the
[1260.19s -> 1268.19s]  count wrong. And you know that's one of those things oh strike call and that
[1268.19s -> 1274.35s]  will set down David Honk and do it for this first inning so we did get our
[1274.35s -> 1277.99s]  first baserunner of the game but a pair of strikeouts in the caught stealing
[1277.99s -> 1283.35s]  they go in order once again do the California Circus back with more JBA
[1283.35s -> 1398.04s]  action after this. And we are back at car shield field this is the germa baseball
[1398.04s -> 1404.04s]  association I am Storm Williamson joined by former caveman great Gary grunt soon
[1404.04s -> 1408.82s]  to be Hall of Famer next year they're gonna have that induction for you we got
[1408.82s -> 1413.06s]  some noise coming from the circus dugout Elbertson trying to check this
[1413.06s -> 1416.94s]  bat right now from Roy Flushman we saw Flushman get in between what could have
[1416.94s -> 1422.62s]  been an altercation in that first inning. Look at that defensive lineup for the circus. Buckle
[1422.62s -> 1428.32s]  towing the rubber helium on first laughing kid on second. Oh the circus with
[1428.32s -> 1432.54s]  some noise from the dugout but it's booted it's short unable to make the
[1432.54s -> 1437.90s]  play polka dot. Polka dot very upset with the shortstop unable to make that play
[1437.90s -> 1443.18s]  just a slow roller to that left side you could argue the play should have been
[1443.18s -> 1448.78s]  made as look right toward the shortstop for the circus. And you know we have we
[1448.78s -> 1455.01s]  have security just beyond the first base bag he was patting down Roy Flushman
[1455.01s -> 1457.37s]  right there just to make sure that nothing nefarious was going on have
[1457.37s -> 1462.03s]  anything illegal on the field there's no chewing gum no no sunflower seeds they
[1462.03s -> 1464.69s]  got to make sure we keep this field clean. You never know where these
[1464.69s -> 1468.33s]  magicians are going to hide something that might give them the advantage look
[1468.33s -> 1472.73s]  at him drop the bunt pull it back and put it in the left field that is a
[1472.73s -> 1477.29s]  beautiful piece of hitting by Craig mystery keeping it a mystery what he's
[1477.29s -> 1480.29s]  gonna do with the play. Yeah Craig doing a very good job showed bunt pulled it
[1480.29s -> 1483.49s]  back and roped a single now Elbertson looking at him now he's coming over to
[1483.49s -> 1490.45s]  talk to him. Is Elbertson saying something illegal? Not on the field dugout dugout
[1492.88s -> 1503.01s]  you can't I don't know how it works. Oh no smoking on the field I guess uh he was
[1503.01s -> 1507.37s]  trying to have a smoke at a pancake which that's not allowed here so great
[1507.37s -> 1513.29s]  job by Elbertson to keep it clean here. Yeah they're gonna have to have a talk with the
[1513.29s -> 1521.93s]  manager for the magicians. Yeah he is not gonna have this. That's a warning.
[1521.97s -> 1526.06s]  Joy Hansen you know tobacco products allowed on the field in this game. He's
[1526.06s -> 1528.98s]  saying look just a little bit can't can't we just have just a couple of
[1528.98s -> 1532.50s]  puffs when we get to first base you know just a little like a first base break I
[1532.50s -> 1535.34s]  mean look at this we got some pipe action going on in the other dugout
[1535.34s -> 1538.54s]  what's the big deal? There's no puffing the magic dragon or any dragon here in
[1538.54s -> 1546.84s]  the car shard field car shield field so there'll be no puffing. Slow one comes in
[1546.84s -> 1552.48s]  it's fouled back off the bat Ronnie Smith. Now we're gonna have a mascot
[1552.48s -> 1558.56s]  battle behind home plate between the clowns excuse me for the circus and the
[1558.56s -> 1564.40s]  magicians as you can see the looks like Dumbledore and Dumbledore has stolen a
[1564.40s -> 1570.68s]  fan sign and used it as a weapon here that is a lot of action on the field and
[1570.68s -> 1574.80s]  in the stands here security has to come over maybe separate the two mascots
[1574.80s -> 1579.00s]  behind home plate so the pitcher doesn't get distracted. You see big boy going with
[1579.00s -> 1584.80s]  that split grip to start how hard is it for a guy like him to to keep things
[1584.80s -> 1588.12s]  under control when there's so much going on with the call strike. A lot of distraction but we
[1588.12s -> 1592.16s]  see it all the time in the JPA so these guys are used to it they could stay
[1592.16s -> 1597.04s]  locked in stay laser focused on the task at hand and big boys got a chance to
[1597.04s -> 1602.40s]  for a double play here. Albertson is rightfully calling out look we have a
[1602.40s -> 1605.56s]  team called the circus yet it's the magicians that have been the circus in
[1605.56s -> 1609.84s]  the dugout. Yeah absolutely a clown show right now for the magicians creating a
[1609.84s -> 1614.08s]  lot of havoc talking a lot of smack directing a lot of their hostilities
[1614.08s -> 1622.84s]  towards Albertson. You know they are the circus but this is a team that's won 30
[1622.84s -> 1628.16s]  games this year and you think about a circus maybe being disorganized this
[1628.16s -> 1631.28s]  might be one of the more organized circuses you'll find out there is big
[1632.24s -> 1636.16s]  off balance as he comes home with it and that go it's all the way to the
[1636.16s -> 1641.32s]  backstop so runners advanced to second and third base in our count goes to two
[1641.32s -> 1647.29s]  and two so that was a call strike. So big chance for the magicians now to get on
[1647.29s -> 1651.25s]  the board two runners in scoring position let's see if they can get this
[1651.25s -> 1656.98s]  ball in play no out still here at the top of the second. You know one-man crew
[1656.98s -> 1662.38s]  just how clean this home plate is for a one-man crew truly incredible big
[1662.38s -> 1667.42s]  boy buckle still waiting for this plate to get wiped off and you know we talked
[1667.42s -> 1671.14s]  about some of the distractions now the stoppage in play he looks like he's in
[1671.14s -> 1675.34s]  rhythm out there. And he's starting to find his tempo find that rhythm see if he
[1675.34s -> 1678.58s]  floats one across play again the two different styles of pitchers is on
[1678.58s -> 1682.54s]  display here tonight as you know a big boy just kind of lost it over the plate
[1682.54s -> 1688.46s]  relies on his on his off-speed stuff doesn't throw anything overpowering has
[1688.46s -> 1693.42s]  to hit his spots and he walks the batter here yeah big boys not happy with
[1693.42s -> 1698.00s]  that he thought that one bounced up into the zone and Albertson is trying to show
[1698.00s -> 1704.66s]  him that big boys still not buying it and now our bases are loaded over there
[1704.66s -> 1707.54s]  at first base trying to make sure that the magicians have everything together
[1707.54s -> 1715.34s]  we have a power card we have a power card being played Albertson there it is
[1715.34s -> 1721.82s]  what card is being played here let's see it's a common card all opposing
[1721.82s -> 1726.66s]  outfielders are removed for the next at-bat what a card to play that is the
[1726.66s -> 1730.18s]  kind of managing we love to see here in the JBA and you know this is just a
[1730.18s -> 1734.38s]  veteran move by joy handsome you see why this team has been so successful all
[1734.38s -> 1738.98s]  year long bases loaded jam nobody out how are how are we gonna do this poof
[1738.98s -> 1743.42s]  that's how we're gonna do it we're gonna put that poof card out there and see if
[1743.42s -> 1749.30s]  they can't even capitalize even more here for the magicians smart time to
[1749.30s -> 1755.02s]  play this card poof the outfielders are gone and a big chance for the magicians
[1755.02s -> 1760.06s]  to get some runs on the board and interesting the Fred Big Top was you
[1760.06s -> 1764.38s]  know coming out as if to show that he was not happy with that call that is
[1764.38s -> 1769.26s]  well within league rules there's supposed to be a power court has to be
[1769.26s -> 1772.74s]  played before the batter steps into the batter's box look at first pitch
[1772.74s -> 1778.22s]  swinging there's nobody out there all the way to the surf shark sign and they
[1778.22s -> 1783.38s]  are not going to be able to do anything about it look at the big man chug here
[1783.38s -> 1790.47s]  goes Donovan Slate into third base with the triple all the bases are still
[1790.47s -> 1795.79s]  loaded and the bases are still loaded three runs come around to score and two
[1795.79s -> 1799.95s]  more runners out on the path they just kept going around the clowns are trying
[1799.95s -> 1804.11s]  to settle the show right now and playing that these up now we got a look
[1804.11s -> 1808.90s]  out run down run down here in the infield it's a mystery as to what's
[1808.90s -> 1812.74s]  going on Craig mystery being chased he's single to get a board he later came
[1812.74s -> 1820.54s]  around to score Albertson trying to gain control of this mess right now and he
[1820.54s -> 1824.98s]  gets those players off the field so what a triple there from the magicians here's
[1824.98s -> 1828.86s]  another look at it lined in the left field smoked nobody out there again the
[1829.02s -> 1837.46s]  card was played no outfielders for that that the magicians capitalize just like
[1837.46s -> 1841.94s]  that our first runs of the ballgame they belong to the Maryland magicians it's a
[1841.94s -> 1847.47s]  three nothing score in the top of the second inning still nobody out here for
[1847.47s -> 1854.46s]  the magicians and the circus now have their outfielders back see how big boy
[1854.46s -> 1858.34s]  buckle respond here trying to put a little mustard on the ball like that
[1858.34s -> 1862.18s]  little slap swag with that last delivery excuse me is we're gonna fly
[1862.18s -> 1867.38s]  ball into right it's caught tagging and holding at third base that gun of an
[1867.38s -> 1872.14s]  arm from Lenny Munson keeps him put Munson doesn't mess around as a great
[1872.14s -> 1876.46s]  right arm really flight that ball into home plate so good job keep the runner
[1876.46s -> 1881.54s]  at third base and we still stay at three nothing with one out here at the top of
[1881.54s -> 1886.34s]  the second I don't know about you Gary but I do not test people named Lenny
[1886.34s -> 1893.72s]  Munson is one of those don't test them and don't trust them that one comes in
[1893.72s -> 1898.08s]  just a touch low from big boy buckle he's been varying his not only his
[1898.08s -> 1902.72s]  delivery but the speed of his pitches as well yeah has featured a couple of
[1902.72s -> 1905.32s]  different wind-ups here this one's smoked back up the middle that'll score
[1905.32s -> 1909.50s]  another run for the magicians look at that off the bat of Barry bedazzle he's
[1909.50s -> 1914.72s]  got the magicians up for nil gotta wonder if the circus is thinking about
[1914.72s -> 1918.50s]  getting someone warmed up at the bullpen now as buckle has struggled here in the
[1918.50s -> 1925.94s]  first inning and two-thirds Wow what a promising start for big boy buckle and
[1925.94s -> 1930.20s]  as the nine hitter Mike salmon comes to the plate he is motioning for his
[1930.20s -> 1934.57s]  outfielders hey come in this guy can't hit the ball anywhere yet they're
[1934.57s -> 1942.00s]  staying out there salmon likes to hit the ball upriver you know I would think
[1942.00s -> 1946.32s]  that a downstream approach might be the path of least resistance but this is a
[1946.32s -> 1951.36s]  guy that has seeked out adversity his entire career yeah really puts a lot of
[1951.36s -> 1955.68s]  power behind the ball can really whip that bat through the strike zone and
[1955.68s -> 1961.98s]  plant the baseball wherever he wants puts it on the ground to the right side
[1961.98s -> 1965.90s]  laughing tin to the bag at second a perfect one hop throw gets the lead
[1965.90s -> 1971.82s]  runner turn to first base not in time two down now so feelers choice there
[1971.82s -> 1975.38s]  couldn't get the double play for the ball over there in the California
[1975.38s -> 1980.97s]  circus another replay here is just getting over the top of that and again
[1980.97s -> 1984.65s]  crew chief Elbertson having to take charge and really make sure that these
[1984.65s -> 1989.41s]  teams understand who's in charge out here yeah let's keep both managers in
[1989.41s -> 1997.85s]  check is having another conversation with the circus right now that facial
[1997.85s -> 2001.47s]  expression for Fred big top a little bit more fitting now that we moved into the
[2001.47s -> 2006.79s]  second inning down for nil take the slow walk back to the top of the dugout and
[2006.79s -> 2010.35s]  what's this what's this Elbertson is stopping play there's a drone on the
[2010.35s -> 2016.27s]  field oh no Albertson doesn't like likes to keep it again within the rules of
[2016.27s -> 2020.27s]  play and right now we just have a drone hovering over come on field and
[2020.27s -> 2023.77s]  Albertson is I think he's afraid that this could affect play maybe the ball
[2023.77s -> 2028.55s]  could potentially hit the the drone and affect where it lands and as they're
[2028.55s -> 2031.67s]  trying to get this drone out of here these are some of the things you have to
[2031.67s -> 2036.47s]  appreciate about in Albertson called game there is some chaos in this league
[2036.47s -> 2041.87s]  from time to time Albertson keeps things under wraps and now we get big top with
[2041.87s -> 2047.63s]  a happy Gilmore style Oh Ichiro's it off the belt and it's caught then dropped
[2047.63s -> 2052.51s]  in right what's the call what is Albertson saying there's some confusion
[2052.51s -> 2056.95s]  on the base pass they're ruling him out three hours three hours he called them
[2056.95s -> 2064.47s]  out so wow the cricket style delivery from buckle gets the out and the inning
[2064.47s -> 2070.31s]  is over on the damage has been believable stuff this is why you tune in
[2070.31s -> 2200.89s]  to the germa baseball association don't go anywhere we've got more next the

[2251.02s -> 2261.71s]  Giggles takes a ball so Doug Dove back to work for the magicians and what looked
[2261.71s -> 2264.67s]  like you know that leadoff baserunner for California in the bottom of the
[2264.67s -> 2267.71s]  first inning that they might be the first to crack the scoreboard wouldn't
[2267.71s -> 2272.99s]  really expect this four-nothing score as Albertson might get done with this call
[2272.99s -> 2276.43s]  sometime tonight it was a big-time strike so he had to emphasize the call
[2276.43s -> 2281.57s]  man it was a great pitch on the outside corner another one of the reasons why
[2281.57s -> 2284.85s]  you tune in to Albertson games maybe just a little bit more than others
[2284.85s -> 2288.29s]  throughout this league on the ground back up the middle Giggles gets it past
[2288.29s -> 2293.77s]  the glove of the diving shortstop in the centerfield a leadoff base it nice job
[2293.77s -> 2298.57s]  by Giggles to get a take with the pitcher gave him just drove it right back
[2298.57s -> 2303.98s]  up the middle you can see great swing here got enough power behind that pass
[2303.98s -> 2307.86s]  the diving shortstop and into the centerfield no wand is gonna get that
[2307.86s -> 2315.95s]  ball Zeke flash gave it a look but even he not fast enough now Manny up Chuck
[2315.99s -> 2324.00s]  and he's getting the crowd pumped they love it up Chuck trying to create an
[2324.00s -> 2328.52s]  uppercut type swing here they circus needs to get back into this game
[2328.52s -> 2338.06s]  uppercut strike call from Albertson oh and one ten bombs on the year for up
[2338.06s -> 2346.74s]  Chuck he looks for another runner on first base is Sean Giggles and he puts a
[2346.74s -> 2350.50s]  charge into this one into deep centerfield turned around on it but the
[2350.50s -> 2355.46s]  play made out there good job by Xavier McMagic yeah great footwork out there by
[2355.46s -> 2360.90s]  McMagic Sean why he's a center fielder great form was turned around a little
[2360.90s -> 2369.04s]  bit but that ball was driven into that deep left center and Giggles will remain
[2369.04s -> 2375.48s]  his first basal still one runner on as a good catch there from McMagic the
[2375.48s -> 2380.76s]  center fielder for the magicians and not sure if we're dealing with an injury for
[2380.96s -> 2384.12s]  Doug Dove right now but he's been shoving now they're all at the mound for a meeting
[2384.12s -> 2392.36s]  oh something has come out here this is a little magic potion maybe a little elixir
[2392.36s -> 2400.52s]  oh for the team the feel-good juice as if Doug Dove wasn't in enough of a groove
[2400.52s -> 2404.52s]  already and now look at this the circus getting involved here on the mound yeah
[2404.52s -> 2408.92s]  the jesters want to get in on that a magic elixir see a pie out there as well
[2408.92s -> 2417.74s]  oh Albertson trying to get the pie off the field I've got a feeling somebody is
[2417.74s -> 2423.30s]  going to get served not with a paper but a pie sooner than later here sir as long
[2423.30s -> 2427.10s]  as it's got a little whipped cream on there maybe it's a banana split pie and
[2427.10s -> 2431.90s]  cream pie key lime pie either way we'll serve it up slices here tonight
[2431.90s -> 2437.46s]  car shield stadium so up Chuck retired for the first out in the inning and here
[2437.46s -> 2448.01s]  comes Harry helium helium having some words with Albertson wants to make sure
[2448.01s -> 2455.45s]  the zones right dove after the magic elixir drops in a strike over the inside
[2455.45s -> 2462.05s]  corner the clown mascot really trying to encourage the circus to get some runs
[2462.05s -> 2468.10s]  get some hits and get back to this game trailing for nothing by the second dove
[2468.10s -> 2475.06s]  looking energized his pitch just a touch tall he went with the heater that time
[2475.54s -> 2491.06s]  the next to Harry off the end of his bat he'll poke it foul up the right side
[2491.06s -> 2496.90s]  Harry helium hitting 254 on the season that on base percentage all the way up
[2496.90s -> 2501.78s]  at 355 though that gets plenty of air underneath his batted balls has a high
[2501.78s -> 2506.30s]  pitched voice as well as he tries to combine all that in to a nice power
[2506.30s -> 2515.22s]  stroke there's nothing like the hairy helium high when he sends one long we'll
[2515.22s -> 2522.63s]  see if you can put a charge into one here with his next one to count and now
[2522.63s -> 2527.07s]  all of a sudden some consternation behind home plate I believe hunter
[2527.07s -> 2532.17s]  sweets is what are they I think you just want to know what count was make sure you
[2532.17s -> 2536.13s]  had it right okay so Harry helium to decide what pitch you wanted to put down
[2536.13s -> 2548.10s]  for dub the throw and now the pitch popped up back behind home plate out of
[2548.10s -> 2560.01s]  play off the bat of helium one ball two strikes to helium going with the
[2560.01s -> 2563.13s]  interesting makeup can't really get some makeup around that beard so going with
[2563.13s -> 2568.97s]  the quarter face makeup the dark eyes it's a beard that would make a former
[2568.97s -> 2573.25s]  caveman proud you know what I was born but was born came out of the mama's
[2573.25s -> 2578.53s]  womb with a with a with a beard and that's most cavemen doing and you were
[2578.53s -> 2585.13s]  telling me before the game little known fact about Phoenix cavemen players there
[2585.13s -> 2589.89s]  is a minimum back hair requirement in order to even even get a call to the
[2589.89s -> 2594.93s]  trial yes you have to have at least a good three inch thick fur on the back
[2594.93s -> 2599.37s]  especially across the shoulder blades from left to right that will really get
[2599.37s -> 2602.37s]  you into the league of cavemen but if you got those patches down on the left
[2602.37s -> 2610.18s]  right near the backside of the ribs too we'll take you as well not too picky and
[2610.18s -> 2617.78s]  helium takes it outside so two and two the count now to Harry helium and right
[2617.78s -> 2622.02s]  now Doug Dove just having his way with this circus lineup something we're not
[2622.06s -> 2627.86s]  used to seeing from California no not at all looking for laughing gas matter this
[2627.86s -> 2632.98s]  ball is drilled into center field but should be easy work for the magic the
[2632.98s -> 2639.59s]  hat off and everything a little flair without number two I got good wood to it
[2639.59s -> 2644.19s]  unfortunately gets got a little too underneath that ball and a great play by
[2644.19s -> 2650.67s]  big magic to get to that one and stay scoreless here is the circus in danger
[2650.67s -> 2654.80s]  of leaving a runner on base here they need runs there is no doubt this
[2654.80s -> 2663.70s]  Maryland team knows how to put on a show as it brings in Larry Munson Munson
[2663.70s -> 2669.62s]  sends a third fly ball into centerfield hat off again Mick magic has done it
[2669.62s -> 2674.86s]  all three of the outs in this inning awfully impressive we'll head to break
[2674.86s -> 2802.46s]  when we come back we'll have the third inning from car shield field welcome back
[2802.54s -> 2808.10s]  to car shield field this is the germa baseball association I am storm
[2808.10s -> 2812.82s]  Williamson joined by Gary grunt a 4-0 lead for the magicians and it's been
[2812.82s -> 2817.64s]  some good baseball this far very good baseball and I was able to get downed
[2817.64s -> 2820.64s]  into the locker room I asked if I can interview some of the players and they
[2820.64s -> 2827.48s]  said be with you in a minute so Richard Looney out there unicycling in center
[2827.48s -> 2832.48s]  field actually we've got three outfielders unicycling currently first
[2832.48s -> 2836.68s]  ball hit hard on the ground by Mick magic who recorded all three outs in the
[2836.68s -> 2840.52s]  last half inning he's retired by a strong throw from polka dot to open up
[2840.52s -> 2842.76s]  the third you can see what he was trying to do they're trying to get it to the
[2842.76s -> 2848.40s]  outfield where the outfielders are in on unicycle so he was a high chopping swing
[2848.40s -> 2853.36s]  just got over that ball and hit it to the shorts that great play that first
[2853.36s -> 2857.68s]  out worth noting that our only runs or first runs of this game I should say
[2857.68s -> 2861.80s]  came from a poof card and now we've got our second card of the game being played
[2861.80s -> 2866.48s]  this time by the circus who the understudy card looks to be being played
[2866.48s -> 2872.20s]  here from the circus we're gonna need we're gonna need the magicians mascot
[2872.20s -> 2878.37s]  you're on this one is opposing teams mascot much must pitch for this
[2878.37s -> 2884.40s]  happening this is a rare card and the California circus was able to pull this
[2884.40s -> 2890.00s]  power card and pregame and now we'll see Dumbledore look at this guy ill pitch
[2890.00s -> 2896.84s]  for at least this batter is at the entire inning look out knuckleball
[2896.84s -> 2902.22s]  pitcher heading to the mound your you have to be Dumbledore can
[2902.22s -> 2907.51s]  unspin it with the best of them wonderful bring his wand out or he'll
[2907.51s -> 2913.55s]  just use his hand some interesting moves there is he's gonna have to give way to
[2913.55s -> 2919.11s]  big boy buckle and you know before that poof card big boy buckle has really done
[2919.11s -> 2922.35s]  everything in his power to keep his California circus in this game yeah he's
[2922.35s -> 2927.47s]  changed up his delivery style he's gone quicker he's gone faster he tried to
[2927.47s -> 2931.43s]  cricket style delivery he's tried dealing it from the left side of the
[2931.43s -> 2934.99s]  mound right side of the mound he's really been trying to switch it up and
[2934.99s -> 2940.83s]  keep these magician batters from getting comfortable inside that box and he's
[2940.83s -> 2945.91s]  calling a shot shot call there from number 31 I think so and he's gonna lay
[2945.95s -> 2953.43s]  down the bunt look at this Zeke flash hot dog beating it out the fake call your
[2953.43s -> 2959.50s]  shot he went Babe Ruth with it and he pulls down the bunt single what a play
[2959.50s -> 2964.98s]  the clowns are definitely caught off guard there magicians at it again take
[2964.98s -> 2968.98s]  a look on the fans Lee instant replay that's as good as it gets from the
[2968.98s -> 2978.66s]  flash what a what a trick pulled out of the hat there for the magicians getting
[2978.66s -> 2984.28s]  a runner on board a chance to add to their lead and as Dumbledore will face
[2984.28s -> 2990.52s]  batter number two Roy Flushman puts a bat on it and off the unicycle it goes
[2990.52s -> 2996.26s]  over the head artificial surface it's bouncy out there he ditched the
[2996.26s -> 3001.68s]  unicycle as well the runners will hold up at third base they do hold so we'll
[3001.68s -> 3007.80s]  see if Albertson wants to go out make sure make sure that's not an automatic
[3007.80s -> 3011.92s]  run or anything is again the right fielder was not on the unicycle dropped
[3011.96s -> 3019.10s]  it right there user error got over the head lost the wig boy what a clown show
[3019.10s -> 3026.62s]  oh we got our first pie in the face Albertson pie in the face Albertson the
[3026.62s -> 3032.46s]  circus one of that play called dead because oh and he is tossed he's gone
[3032.46s -> 3042.28s]  Albertson don't have any of that look at that Schmidt Papo Papo with the pie to the face and now
[3042.96s -> 3045.84s]  the magicians and excuse me now the mascots are chasing one another around
[3045.84s -> 3051.52s]  the field chaos has broken out here as a pie in the face I think that's Albertson's
[3051.52s -> 3056.12s]  50th pie to the face this season but he's no stranger to the pie in the face
[3056.12s -> 3061.04s]  he wears it well let's take another look at this pie in the face see the argument
[3061.04s -> 3068.38s]  happening at boom right there right in to the face is that shaving cream or
[3068.38s -> 3071.90s]  whipped cream he's not eating it so I can only assume that it's shaving cream
[3072.54s -> 3078.39s]  you know you would think a lot of umpires might be a little bit more upset
[3078.39s -> 3085.19s]  oh now he's just now he's just upset the turf monster got him tripped him up a
[3085.19s -> 3089.27s]  little bit he's tossing the rubber he's tossing the turf out of this game as
[3089.27s -> 3090.19s]  well
[3090.19s -> 3096.35s]  unbelievable and we'll see now maybe this gets maybe this gets joy handsome back
[3096.35s -> 3099.55s]  in the good graces of Albertson
[3100.43s -> 3104.78s]  of course Albertson an ultimate professional doesn't want to wipe that
[3104.78s -> 3108.90s]  off just wants to keep play going in our official score if you're wondering if
[3108.90s -> 3113.58s]  you're scoring at home 9 on that play e9 on that play for your keep track at
[3113.58s -> 3118.06s]  home for this broadcast here tonight glad you're with us storm it's always a
[3118.06s -> 3134.41s]  pleasure to be alongside you and this is a real issue mascot now we had one of
[3134.41s -> 3139.41s]  these mascots called out for the card there's a reason yeah for double doors
[3139.41s -> 3144.90s]  should be there double doors should be there but the clown mascot needs to exit
[3144.90s -> 3152.44s]  the field he's holding up the pace of play here and now Albertson just just
[3152.44s -> 3159.33s]  exasperated here and I got a new batter coming to the plate says Ronnie Smith
[3159.33s -> 3166.63s]  first in to him hit on the ground sharply to short look him back poke it
[3166.63s -> 3170.67s]  out across the diamond it's too tall and it bounces into the stands
[3170.67s -> 3174.87s]  boy Ronnie with the least clever name on the magicians but that's a great
[3174.87s -> 3180.95s]  baseball play they're showing the aggressiveness as Albertson now trying
[3180.95s -> 3186.83s]  to explain what happens here so they're going to give second base to Smith and
[3186.83s -> 3191.71s]  run another run scored I do believe so it should be five nothing run score run
[3192.31s -> 3200.17s]  Albertson confirms right on top of it polka dot apologize for the language our
[3200.17s -> 3204.61s]  effects Mike sometimes picks up some of the the on field language and we
[3204.61s -> 3208.13s]  apologize to our younger viewers if anyone was offended by that from the
[3208.13s -> 3211.53s]  umpire the heat of the battle you know there are a lot of things to learn out
[3211.53s -> 3215.21s]  here and as a ballplayer learning to curse at the right time is a big part of
[3215.21s -> 3218.89s]  the game yep and that'll be out number two run will score though on the chopper
[3218.89s -> 3222.33s]  to the left side what's the third base been doing it I don't think he thought
[3222.33s -> 3228.37s]  the hit or touch base and bringing it over to the first baseman guess he's
[3228.37s -> 3232.41s]  not confident and the throw across the diamond didn't want another run
[3232.41s -> 3236.77s]  advancing there is again the circus was just charged with another air on that
[3236.77s -> 3241.26s]  overthrow in the first baseman looks another runner at first now for the
[3241.26s -> 3245.48s]  magicians Percy throwing it all over the yard and now Donovan Slate comes to the
[3245.48s -> 3253.30s]  plate he had that big bases clearing triple back in the second inning still
[3253.30s -> 3261.05s]  dealing with with that really is a lot of pie in the face there for out here
[3261.05s -> 3267.33s]  crew chief Albertson and he's calling time and now he's headed out towards
[3267.33s -> 3272.73s]  towards right field I believe he's asked for the grounds crew something wrong
[3272.73s -> 3277.39s]  with the field right now and he'll go out for some inspection and as he's
[3277.39s -> 3281.63s]  calling the Empire is calling for the grounds crew and of course when you're
[3281.63s -> 3287.03s]  involved with any baseball league the grounds crew guy is really that makes
[3287.03s -> 3291.43s]  really makes the game go the way they keep up the field how they paint the
[3291.43s -> 3297.55s]  lines take care of the turf I'm not sure what Albertson sees out in the outfield
[3297.55s -> 3302.19s]  here it looks like there's an errant sheet there is here comes the grounds
[3302.19s -> 3307.87s]  keeper out of the right field bullpen oh look out look out breaks are on the
[3307.87s -> 3315.40s]  right side sir it's right just kidding around the lot it's right here so look oh
[3315.40s -> 3322.23s]  man yeah that's an arid piece an arid piece of grass here let's see what he
[3322.23s -> 3327.43s]  has to say you can get to listen in here on what Albertson has to say to the
[3327.43s -> 3337.58s]  grounds crew definitely an artificial piece of grass has been placed on the
[3337.58s -> 3344.42s]  turf oh look at the tool he's getting out now you're gonna do a little no
[3344.42s -> 3359.06s]  okay okay unbelievable it's a manscaping I believe he is manscaping this field
[3359.06s -> 3364.17s]  right now that is that is the manscape trip look at the job it's doing I mean
[3364.17s -> 3368.77s]  that's a great job out of that trip maybe he could have used that manscaped
[3368.77s -> 3375.69s]  razor behind home plate you know we saw him tripping on earlier I think we're
[3375.69s -> 3381.33s]  having mic problems I think the pie to the face has affected the audio here so
[3381.33s -> 3389.08s]  what a good job of manscaping that piece of lawn pulling the pie right out of his
[3389.08s -> 3395.86s]  mic yeah and you saw Harry helium got a little swab of that pie on his way out
[3395.86s -> 3400.78s]  there and he approved maybe that's why crew chief Albertson not too upset about
[3400.78s -> 3404.10s]  that pie see in the background there the center fielder and right fielder trying
[3404.10s -> 3413.88s]  to stay warm as they get back on the unicycles left fielder right fielder
[3413.88s -> 3427.31s]  using a boxing gloves here in this half inning so technical difficulties on the field Albertson is trying to get it
[3427.31s -> 3432.51s]  straight but he stopped time here he called time is again there's a out of
[3432.51s -> 3437.43s]  nowhere just a random piece of sod laid on the field and we can't have that as
[3437.43s -> 3443.03s]  it's not the same level as the artificial turf here so Albertson had to
[3443.03s -> 3447.99s]  do some manscaping this grounds crew you know a great job except for that one
[3447.99s -> 3454.01s]  patch and it makes you wonder here Gary is there ill intent to have this entire
[3454.01s -> 3457.93s]  place so pristine and almost as if they're trying to pull something on
[3457.93s -> 3461.77s]  Albertson here we saw behind home plate and now out in right field this is just
[3461.77s -> 3466.65s]  ridiculous could be one of the classic magician illusions here just came out of
[3466.65s -> 3470.97s]  nowhere has to make you wonder if Isaac illusion had something to do with this
[3470.97s -> 3476.17s]  you it does make you wonder I did see a wand in the dugout oh look out for the
[3476.17s -> 3479.89s]  grounds crew guy who's gonna look out look out oh boy I mean he's got the
[3479.89s -> 3484.73s]  security man with them this is a lawsuit waiting to happen yeah driving
[3484.73s -> 3488.17s]  around and look out for the players now as I think now we need to get the
[3488.17s -> 3491.93s]  grounds crew guy and off the field security guy making sure everyone stays
[3491.93s -> 3496.85s]  off as well so as I was saying right of course I forget about the fact that the
[3496.85s -> 3501.05s]  clowns the circus team thought it was really funny to knock the microphone out
[3501.05s -> 3504.51s]  with the five really great probably from the replay but anyways this is the

[3596.51s -> 3601.87s]  Manscaped that's a good call we do have a former caveman on our broadcast if you
[3601.87s -> 3605.63s]  haven't heard there is quite a bit of hair on his back that he does need to
[3605.63s -> 3610.35s]  tend to so we will hear from Gary a little bit later actually I believe he
[3610.35s -> 3614.51s]  is taking care of that rather quick says quite a bit about how well a job that

[3935.66s -> 3940.06s]  Gary grunt and now the circus need to get something going here yeah
[3940.06s -> 3944.22s]  absolutely surely by five runs here they're half of the third inning this is
[3944.22s -> 3947.82s]  no more of a laughing matter they have got to get some runs and it has to start
[3947.82s -> 3955.80s]  right now Paul laughing tin we'll try to get it going he cracks one foul on to
[3955.80s -> 3961.20s]  the green stuff out in the left field territory foul territory excuse me
[3961.20s -> 3965.20s]  almost hit the basketball hoop on that left side of the field there's a
[3965.20s -> 3970.09s]  playground as well done that left side is how we're doing we'll get some more
[3970.09s -> 3976.89s]  balls to home plate as we've seen a couple of now hard-hit balls find the
[3976.89s -> 3983.13s]  stands some of that feel-good juice again for the magicians the elixir of
[3983.13s -> 3987.89s]  life if you will it makes you wonder if if Doug Dove is getting an unfair
[3987.89s -> 3995.22s]  advantage out here performance enhancing elixir is that what you're saying and
[3995.22s -> 4000.90s]  you know what the juice it does make you wonder as well is there a potential deal
[4000.90s -> 4004.86s]  with the drunkards in the works that's true too again the drunkards played the
[4004.86s -> 4008.90s]  bimes here a crunch time will be following our broadcast here tonight
[4008.90s -> 4013.66s]  Tom Chairman and Dickie Dreck will have highlights and full breakdowns of the
[4013.66s -> 4017.74s]  games around the JBA today get the drunkards played the bimes not quite
[4017.74s -> 4021.98s]  sure how many sober players the drunkards had today and then the caveman
[4021.98s -> 4027.86s]  versus the old ladies as well happening in the JBA get a look at that lineup for
[4027.86s -> 4032.34s]  the California circus so a reminder that postgame show coming your way after this
[4032.34s -> 4040.76s]  crunch time Dove Oh hidden ball trick it looked like
[4040.76s -> 4047.18s]  flight into right field long run hack comes off and the catch is made great
[4047.18s -> 4054.48s]  running catch by mystery the right fielder to go a long way
[4054.48s -> 4062.52s]  losses had in the process but kept the focus all magicians do with that play
[4062.72s -> 4068.24s]  Xavier McMagic giving his approval from Centerfield we saw him make three
[4068.24s -> 4074.64s]  straight catches out there in Centerfield in the second inning Dove
[4074.64s -> 4079.92s]  more hidden ball tricks as that one's fouled straight back off the pole by
[4079.92s -> 4087.65s]  Greg Taffy yeah Greg Laffy Taffy at the plate right now has plenty different
[4087.65s -> 4093.47s]  flavors and he can be successful with I think there's no doubt that the banana
[4093.59s -> 4098.39s]  flavor is hands down the best so he would love to pull a banana flavored hit
[4098.39s -> 4110.06s]  out of his pocket right here go down there from Taffy and you like that that
[4110.06s -> 4113.54s]  call from Elbertson behind home plate sometimes you're not sure where the
[4113.54s -> 4124.78s]  pitch missed Elbertson always lets you know make magic slowly the magical
[4124.82s -> 4134.70s]  elixir into the glove Xavier McMagic beer in hand this guy can do it all what a
[4134.70s -> 4145.02s]  slab oh what a play falling down part of that entire plate not one drop of beer
[4145.02s -> 4151.62s]  lost not one even the circus have some appreciation for that is a man's play
[4151.62s -> 4156.54s]  right there what way the circus players getting involved with the fans here I
[4156.54s -> 4159.46s]  mean that look like I could be a good reason why they're trailing here five
[4159.46s -> 4162.82s]  nothing they're more focused on the antics of the game rather than playing
[4162.82s -> 4169.22s]  the game hunter sweets looking for a word of encouragement from his lady out
[4169.22s -> 4174.18s]  in the stands after getting caught stealing at second base earlier so after
[4174.18s -> 4184.38s]  the outstanding play here comes sweets trying to steal a little candy from fans
[4184.38s -> 4192.22s]  here to a knee for that one huge swing from hunter sweets but he comes up empty
[4192.22s -> 4196.78s]  the circus have been nothing short of a clown show thus far no I know it's a
[4196.78s -> 4207.30s]  moonwalk moonwalk strike call there from chief umpire Elbertson fall back play I
[4207.30s -> 4212.02s]  see the security guard now walking in the around the stands you can see him
[4212.02s -> 4217.74s]  there he's enjoying some of that nice elixir as well passes it off
[4218.10s -> 4222.50s]  we are in good hands here tonight nothing gonna happen here
[4222.50s -> 4230.66s]  security has done a nice job going with the backwards hat now keep within the
[4230.66s -> 4237.82s]  rules and regulations of the game and the ballpark fair oh two and sweets is
[4237.94s -> 4246.42s]  hit again breaks his bat stop stop them yeah wisely throws the broken bat away
[4246.42s -> 4250.38s]  doesn't want to get caught with a weapon security might have to come to the
[4250.38s -> 4258.18s]  field again to keep the fireworks up exploding here so the second time he's
[4258.18s -> 4263.78s]  been hit and warnings have been issued by Albertson doesn't want this hand
[4263.94s -> 4269.66s]  game to get out of hand and you wonder if frustration might boil over here for
[4269.66s -> 4273.58s]  the circus they're losing this game big they've been hit by a pitch for the
[4273.58s -> 4276.82s]  second straight time and now their dugout gets worn for getting hit by the
[4276.82s -> 4283.59s]  pitch I think the magicians were trying to say he dove into that he wasn't
[4283.59s -> 4289.19s]  really hit by it okay they're going bonkers yeah try to break out the jack
[4289.23s -> 4297.13s]  hammer there's handsome on the mound trying to settle his group down he took
[4297.13s -> 4300.21s]  the pie to the face well but I don't know how well that jack hammer is gonna
[4300.21s -> 4304.29s]  go no no and that is exactly what the magicians are arguing they don't think
[4304.29s -> 4307.35s]  that he was actually hit by the pitch they think it hit the bat and that's why
[4307.35s -> 4311.29s]  the bat broke so we'll see what Albertson comes what kind of conclusion
[4311.29s -> 4317.45s]  he comes to well we have a runner-on first for the California circus
[4317.61s -> 4323.93s]  joy handsome has made his way back onto the bad side of Albertson let's go let's
[4323.93s -> 4333.06s]  go let's go Joey handsome manager for the magicians
[4333.06s -> 4344.31s]  don't have an assistant here they're highly sought after though polka dot who
[4344.31s -> 4348.07s]  has popped nine home runs this year
[4348.63s -> 4355.77s]  trick the third out of the inning the magicians pull out the wand create a
[4355.77s -> 4359.97s]  little magic and illusion and they're out of this inning store we saw dub do
[4359.97s -> 4365.29s]  it on the mound and now they do it at first base Albertson all over it we're
[4365.29s -> 4371.25s]  still at a five nothing score as we go to the fourth inning a big argument come
[4371.25s -> 4376.21s]  in here you can just see it right now you can see the unhappiness written all
[4376.25s -> 4380.25s]  over the face of the circus manager we'll bring in the conclusion of this
[4380.25s -> 4600.83s]  showdown when we come back you're watching JBA baseball welcome back to
[4600.83s -> 4604.55s]  the German Baseball Association a five-nothing lead for the Maryland
[4604.55s -> 4611.47s]  magicians over the California circus and here is Mike Salmon leading things off
[4611.47s -> 4617.81s]  and oh my this could go on for a while oh my goodness this this is not this is
[4617.81s -> 4623.01s]  not good all that all came out of his eyeball ribbon in the eye that's no fun
[4623.01s -> 4627.93s]  you might need some eye drops to the field really makes you wonder he reached
[4627.93s -> 4632.89s]  base his first time up with all of that in in the back was that hiding in his
[4632.89s -> 4636.25s]  brain where where did that come from even more impressive that he was able to
[4636.25s -> 4641.65s]  get the first inning single with all that and his eye unbelievable we talked
[4641.65s -> 4645.77s]  he loves the adversity we talked about him swimming upstream and now he takes
[4645.77s -> 4653.21s]  it in the ass oh no nobody who ever wants to take it that way hit by the
[4653.21s -> 4659.65s]  pitch and big top or excuse me big boy buckle thrown out of the game and
[4659.65s -> 4663.65s]  the magicians are out of the office or out of their dugout they want buckle
[4663.65s -> 4669.25s]  out of this game is again both teams have been warned here buckle has been
[4669.25s -> 4674.09s]  ushered to the turf his catcher trying to restrain him void hunch is being
[4674.09s -> 4678.85s]  thrown don't need a long-term suspension here for the circus skin
[4678.85s -> 4683.09s]  playing for playoff positioning so Albertson letting the next pitcher
[4683.09s -> 4686.05s]  down there's no messing around he already warned both dugouts in the
[4686.05s -> 4690.21s]  previous inning no more hit batters and the first batter of this top half of
[4690.21s -> 4694.45s]  this fourth inning gets drilled as you said it says you said storm right in the
[4694.45s -> 4701.97s]  ass goodness that that cannot feel good first of all and second big boy on the
[4701.97s -> 4706.53s]  mound I mean there was no fear in crew chief Albertson right there when he
[4706.53s -> 4710.21s]  tossed him out of the game I don't want big boy buckle coming after me I don't
[4710.21s -> 4712.93s]  know about you I'm just not gonna throw him out of the game and I want to be
[4712.93s -> 4719.77s]  taking the dinner before someone goes after my ass now we got another card
[4719.77s -> 4726.93s]  being played here and and dying oh boy our card it's a rare power card let's
[4726.93s -> 4738.54s]  let's get a closer look at this one got to run backwards to the bases the whole
[4738.54s -> 4745.38s]  happening backwards through the bases hole any so all base runners will be
[4745.38s -> 4756.40s]  running backwards this could be big-time trouble we've already seen hunter suites
[4756.40s -> 4760.20s]  caught stealing running forwards I can only imagine backwards yeah I believe
[4760.20s -> 4764.98s]  this is the third power card we've seen here in this game so both managers have
[4764.98s -> 4768.58s]  done a nice job of implementing and choosing and picking their spots wisely
[4768.58s -> 4773.74s]  of when to play that power card oh big boy buckle back on the field he can't
[4773.74s -> 4778.14s]  do this I believe this is Greg Taffy oh who has come in to replace oh goodness
[4778.14s -> 4783.22s]  and we got more theatrics going on now I believe this is big boys come out back
[4783.22s -> 4787.34s]  yeah big boy felt bad for his teammates thought they needed some refreshments
[4787.34s -> 4791.70s]  they you know they've obviously seen the magicians drink on the field so why not
[4791.70s -> 4795.86s]  give it a try the other team you know it ain't cheating ain't trying so
[4795.86s -> 4802.50s]  Albertson's patience is wearing thin here see yep she's trying to oh he's out
[4802.50s -> 4806.82s]  there buckle brought the pie yeah oh oh goodness I think he was just bringing
[4806.82s -> 4809.78s]  some drinks to his fellow partners exactly what he was doing and we've seen
[4809.78s -> 4814.37s]  the turf monster pop up a couple of times here tonight so all the more
[4814.37s -> 4818.97s]  reason to get that manscaper back out exactly that that manscaped razor did
[4818.97s -> 4823.17s]  wonders out in right field we've seen some nice plays out there in right field
[4823.17s -> 4827.01s]  and got some uneven blades out there right now the manscape for 4.0 would be
[4827.01s -> 4830.97s]  a great job speaking of right field by the way right now it's unmanned now the
[4830.97s -> 4834.57s]  right fielder is retreating back to his position but I'm worried about left
[4834.57s -> 4838.41s]  field and center field right now they just do not look very engaged right now
[4838.41s -> 4842.53s]  partner hey you saw no they don't they they've checked out of this game and now
[4842.53s -> 4847.33s]  we see another pitcher going into the bullpen with the backup catcher so Taffy
[4847.33s -> 4851.73s]  gets tapped here the tall right-hander has a rotor on first base and the power
[4851.73s -> 4856.13s]  card was played so all runners will now have to run backwards this entire inning
[4856.13s -> 4860.81s]  throw down the first hold on he retreated back to that bag in a forward style
[4860.81s -> 4865.93s]  crew chief Albertson has not called him on it no he has not and the first baseman
[4865.93s -> 4870.93s]  wanted to call there didn't get it and that is one of the really important
[4870.93s -> 4876.89s]  things to note here Gary is in these situations you have to turn yourself
[4877.05s -> 4880.69s]  around to run backwards back to the bag you can't just run back forward you have
[4880.69s -> 4883.85s]  to go back to the training field you know this doesn't happen all the time so
[4883.85s -> 4887.57s]  you have to rely on your training relying on what you've done get you to
[4887.57s -> 4891.49s]  this moment and just focus on making sure you're back pedaling toes to the
[4891.49s -> 4894.85s]  ground first each toe back pedal left right left right focus on that and you
[4894.85s -> 4899.61s]  should be fine almost muscle memory for Mike salmon over at first base the pitch
[4899.61s -> 4905.49s]  to Donald strange and it's a call strike a big wind-up strike there from Albertson
[4906.49s -> 4923.00s]  more impressive wind-up taffy or Albertson on the ground chopped towards
[4923.00s -> 4928.12s]  second base of backpedaling salmon tagged out and they turned to what a
[4928.12s -> 4933.92s]  double play there again the power card and doing magic right now for on the
[4933.92s -> 4938.76s]  other side for the for the circuses they played they run for our making sure
[4938.76s -> 4945.88s]  those runners run backwards great tag great throw over and just just speed
[4945.88s -> 4950.36s]  from number 20 there is again the on the base passing at the back pedal all the
[4950.36s -> 4954.00s]  way to the dugout as well oh here come the mascots again oh my
[4954.00s -> 4961.60s]  goodness we've got a big-time brawl about to break out the mascots are going
[4961.60s -> 4967.08s]  at it oh they catch her for the circus got a couple unnecessary shots in there
[4967.08s -> 4973.20s]  on Dumbledore oh no this this could be huge problems they are now they have now
[4973.20s -> 4976.92s]  exited the field of play and I don't think this is ending anytime soon
[4976.92s -> 4981.40s]  partner we've seen this before these two have got some serious beef they've gone
[4981.40s -> 4984.84s]  at it the last few times these teams have gotten together this could end
[4984.84s -> 4988.40s]  ugly a couple of right-handed uppercuts from Dumbledore and they are going at it
[4988.40s -> 4992.80s]  on the dugout for the California circuses what no one told you about
[4992.80s -> 4999.08s]  Dumbledore is that in his younger days he was a boxing he was a boxer training
[4999.08s -> 5003.96s]  with Mike Tyson he's showing off the moves this is Nolan Ryan and ask yeah
[5003.96s -> 5009.77s]  continue Robin Ventura and Nolan Ryan basically right there as Dumbledore
[5009.77s -> 5013.33s]  continuing to pummel with the rights security guard is going to get the
[5013.33s -> 5018.41s]  jackhammer is and you know what at least California has something to be happy
[5018.41s -> 5021.89s]  about at this point indeed as they're trying to throw show some fight show some
[5021.89s -> 5026.93s]  spirit but unfortunately Dumbledore was a little too much for the clown and
[5026.93s -> 5032.93s]  mascot showdown let's circle back to the manager for the circus Fred Big Top how
[5032.93s -> 5036.89s]  about the timing of that card that he pulls out there with the runner on first
[5036.89s -> 5040.89s]  to lead off the inning they get the double play now two outs and nobody on
[5040.89s -> 5045.05s]  as that one is shot down the left field line slicing into the corner it's a
[5045.05s -> 5051.34s]  fair ball and it hops over the wall for a ground rule double that ground rule
[5051.34s -> 5060.60s]  double it so yeah a little backpedal into second base as it's given to him
[5060.60s -> 5064.88s]  sprayed that ball down the left side of the field that you see a good cut here
[5064.88s -> 5071.08s]  off of the breaking ball did a nice job to stay back make good contact and ride
[5071.08s -> 5075.96s]  over the Grotto Beast sign the way he keeps his hands inside the baseball
[5075.96s -> 5081.08s]  there on that fans Lee replay but going back to what you're talking about there
[5081.08s -> 5085.36s]  store William said about that power card being played at the right time the
[5085.36s -> 5090.44s]  manager for the California circus oh no it's gone into the locker down with the
[5090.44s -> 5096.96s]  mascots oh boy and this is what we always wanted to see look at this right
[5096.96s -> 5101.52s]  those uppercuts in time oh no the counter now the Dumbledore finally
[5101.52s -> 5104.76s]  taking some shots this has gotten interesting he stays he's dazed and
[5104.76s -> 5111.26s]  confused look at this now they're making out oh my goodness a hate fest is turned
[5111.26s -> 5114.94s]  into all love I don't even want to know what's happening there porn stuff is
[5114.94s -> 5122.66s]  this and the backpedaling player gets past third base coming home it's a good
[5122.66s -> 5132.14s]  throw the backwards slide he's out unbelievable play Xavier McMagic gun down
[5132.14s -> 5138.70s]  at the plate yeah McMagic just a step to slow there a great throw from the left
[5138.70s -> 5142.98s]  fielder to end that inning it all goes back to that power card being played got
[5142.98s -> 5148.86s]  that double play is this the momentum changer the circus beat up the
[5148.86s -> 5154.30s]  magicians mascot and trail it by five we head to the fifth inning you're watching
[5154.30s -> 5166.23s]  Jerma Baseball Association
[5222.25s -> 5229.48s]  you
[5252.50s -> 5268.86s]  welcome back you get a look at crew chief Albertson in command of this game
[5268.86s -> 5271.86s]  we're in the bottom of the fourth inning it's a five-nothing lead for the
[5271.86s -> 5277.14s]  Maryland magicians over the California circus another look at Doug Dove on the
[5277.14s -> 5282.62s]  mound he will go to work once again against this circus order he has had
[5282.62s -> 5289.02s]  all kinds of success so far and former Hall of Fame caveman Gary grunt tell us
[5289.02s -> 5292.74s]  what's been going so well for them so far in this game well the additions have
[5292.74s -> 5297.34s]  done a very good job of you know taking advantage of getting good pitches to hit
[5297.34s -> 5301.66s]  and then driving those balls in the gap scoring those runs and you hope on the
[5301.66s -> 5304.94s]  other side right now if you're a circus fan they string together some
[5304.94s -> 5308.98s]  consecutive hits here only one hit right now through the first four innings Percy
[5308.98s -> 5314.34s]  polka dot hitting a robust 282 on the year in slugging for 44 you'd have to
[5314.34s -> 5318.50s]  think this would be the guy to break them out if anyone yeah the magicians
[5318.50s -> 5323.50s]  are employer have deployed an interesting outfield strategy here that's
[5323.50s -> 5327.66s]  three center fielders right now nobody in left or right field so we'll see how
[5327.66s -> 5331.78s]  this works out for the magicians you know there's a lot of conversation out
[5331.78s -> 5336.62s]  there in center field I think they all just want to play center field they're
[5336.62s -> 5339.54s]  kind of pointing towards the other outfield positions trying to get each
[5339.54s -> 5343.46s]  other to go out there but they have all been determined to play centerfield in
[5343.46s -> 5346.30s]  this anyway that's the position you want to play they don't want to give it up
[5346.30s -> 5352.34s]  and you know ballplayers you know aren't really they want to fight for their for
[5352.38s -> 5355.22s]  that position that they play they want they don't want another position they
[5355.22s -> 5358.30s]  want to play center field right now we've got three of them for the magicians
[5358.30s -> 5362.82s]  out of course out of Maryland as you mentioned earlier it's a coastal battle
[5362.82s -> 5367.30s]  with California taking on a team squad the magicians out of Maryland and
[5367.30s -> 5372.02s]  meanwhile Doug Dove has lost his command a bit on the mound he opens up this
[5372.02s -> 5376.66s]  bottom of the fourth with a four-pitch walk to the leadoff man and now it's the
[5376.66s -> 5380.78s]  three-hitter David Honk coming up for the circus it feels like this is their
[5380.78s -> 5384.94s]  chance right here and we're getting some beer man beer man is on the field
[5384.94s -> 5389.18s]  bringing some libations out to those three centerfielders they needed a
[5389.18s -> 5395.90s]  he's wet that whistle the hard work out there in center and I'll tell you what
[5395.90s -> 5401.02s]  the more impaired these magicians seem to get the better they seem to play
[5401.02s -> 5408.90s]  yeah until now a blast in the left center field and it will one hop the wall he
[5408.90s -> 5412.94s]  was pipping that one the whole way David Honk not running out of the box
[5412.94s -> 5417.30s]  they had him at second base if it was an accurate throw he's still going to third
[5417.30s -> 5424.98s]  as the throw got away he's thinking home here he comes no tag
[5424.98s -> 5439.14s]  oh good move the circus is on the board the swift move the offensive lineman
[5439.14s -> 5445.02s]  going up against a defensive lineman gets to the quarterback and a run is scored
[5445.02s -> 5451.90s]  David Honk showing off the defensive end skills look at that blast off of the
[5451.90s -> 5455.50s]  bat yeah you got not quite all of it but enough to get it to the wall and the
[5455.50s -> 5458.74s]  three centerfielders went to track that one down surprised didn't get it over
[5458.74s -> 5463.66s]  for a ground rule double but good hustle around the base pass to get that run
[5463.66s -> 5467.82s]  across the board two runs across the board magicians manager joy handsome
[5467.82s -> 5473.38s]  contesting the call but indeed that ball was dropped as you get a look at Doug
[5473.38s -> 5477.02s]  Doug there's a swim move we talked about just could not handle that swim too
[5477.02s -> 5482.86s]  powerful yeah it's way too powerful from David Honk and you know some of you out
[5482.86s -> 5487.22s]  there may have played a little MLB slugfest in your day great move there
[5487.22s -> 5492.22s]  from David Honk one of the classic moves that you will ever see in the JBA he
[5492.22s -> 5496.70s]  basically pulled many of our viewers may have played slugfest but what about some
[5496.70s -> 5501.07s]  NFL blitz pulled out a nice NFL blitz move there well he pulled out to bomb
[5501.07s -> 5506.99s]  with the bat in his hands and then he turned on the Jets coming home so two
[5506.99s -> 5513.47s]  runs across for the circus you know storm my friend worked in a circus one
[5513.47s -> 5518.11s]  time he was a human cannonball when he retired it didn't replace him I couldn't
[5518.11s -> 5523.83s]  find anyone else's the same caliber that that is just really a shame you know the
[5523.83s -> 5530.27s]  caliber of this circus team incredible but they have it's heating up right now
[5530.27s -> 5537.37s]  they try to stay off of her try to get another run on first base but a great
[5537.41s -> 5542.87s]  play by the magicians and maybe they've settled back down and as we have another
[5542.87s -> 5547.23s]  break in the action here is here comes the jest the clown gestures from the
[5547.23s -> 5552.99s]  California circus heading to the mound the jugglers oh this now this is
[5552.99s -> 5558.67s]  something that could really get dub dub off of his game he surrendered his first
[5558.67s -> 5562.95s]  two runs of the game in this inning and now we talked about some of those
[5562.95s -> 5567.23s]  distractions that the starting pitcher big boy buckle had to deal with well now
[5567.23s -> 5571.75s]  the tables have turned let's see how the magicians can deal I mean this is
[5571.75s -> 5576.75s]  this is not an easy thing it's hard to juggle those pins in the first place but
[5576.75s -> 5581.43s]  to try to pitch with them going in front of you behind you and now look at this
[5581.43s -> 5587.95s]  another cop power card look like a baby card being played but the baby that's a
[5587.95s -> 5592.99s]  legendary card chosen player must wear a baby bib and baby bonnet for their next
[5593.07s -> 5598.07s]  bat if they do not get a hit and add three runs for your team score and I'll
[5598.07s -> 5603.07s]  tell you what there's a reason why this is a legendary card Gary this is the
[5603.07s -> 5610.23s]  most demoralizing card in JBA play if you do not successfully complete the
[5610.23s -> 5616.47s]  baby bib hit it is one of the biggest game changers in this sport we could see
[5616.47s -> 5621.35s]  a tie ball game after this at bat yeah we absolutely could and certainly don't
[5621.39s -> 5625.79s]  want the embarrassment of having to wear a grown-up having to wear a baby bib but
[5625.79s -> 5630.35s]  that's just the way we played here in the JBA and I'm just super impressed
[5630.35s -> 5635.15s]  right now with the jugglers oh they just knocked the hat off of Doug Dove getting
[5635.15s -> 5639.67s]  a little chirping out for the magicians bench the circus is really rounding into
[5639.67s -> 5647.99s]  form right now in town right now look at all this look at the skill are you
[5648.03s -> 5657.41s]  kidding me crew chief Albertson I think he called himself out umpire panda well
[5657.41s -> 5662.33s]  you know what when you when you have an out call as legendary as crew chief
[5662.33s -> 5666.49s]  Albertson you can't help but call yourself out time and time again no no
[5666.49s -> 5671.41s]  and Albertson showing off the the multi-talented skills that he has and
[5671.85s -> 5679.25s]  maybe we have seen him in the past do the spinning plate trick with a unicycle
[5679.25s -> 5683.69s]  so he toned it down just a little bit there we've seen him in the earlier this
[5683.69s -> 5688.17s]  season where he did it with a unicycle and now the beer guy the magician side
[5688.17s -> 5697.42s]  of it there's our baby bib there this is a huge moment in this game yep there's
[5697.42s -> 5701.78s]  the baby bottle Manny up Chuck where's that bib as good as any of them that's a
[5701.78s -> 5709.54s]  large nipple on that bottle our fabulous crew helping out as well what size
[5709.54s -> 5714.02s]  diaper do you think that is Gary that is a 38 large for sure
[5714.02s -> 5721.82s]  that can hold some liquid 38 large and you know we know can hold some liquid
[5721.82s -> 5727.94s]  the problem is you know if up Chuck deposits some solids into that thing how
[5727.94s -> 5732.46s]  long will it last not very long we've had some bleed-through issues with a
[5732.50s -> 5738.34s]  recall problem with these particular branded diapers so as far as I understand
[5738.34s -> 5743.38s]  the payload is is 30 pounds so as long as Manny up Chuck does not exceed that
[5743.38s -> 5747.62s]  weight he should be okay up chucking is fine they don't any down chucking right
[5747.62s -> 5752.98s]  now that is a great point and that's why we bring oh he maybe wanted to bring the
[5752.98s -> 5757.58s]  bottle to the bait to the to the plate so you're not allowed to do that no
[5757.58s -> 5762.34s]  bottles only libation bottles elixir bottles no baby bottles allow that
[5762.34s -> 5771.26s]  hopefully so here we go should be a lot of action in the hips here if up Chuck
[5771.26s -> 5774.80s]  does not pick up a hit excuse me it would be Maryland to pick up the three
[5774.80s -> 5780.42s]  runs and be out to an eight to two lead up Chuck calls time understanding this
[5780.42s -> 5784.74s]  is a veteran move here by up Chuck he may be wearing a diaper but this this is
[5784.74s -> 5793.22s]  not his first time in the box no sir love the bonnet first pitch from dove
[5793.22s -> 5799.06s]  skips in and he pops it up just past the shortstop tough play but it's made
[5799.06s -> 5805.18s]  and that'll add three more onto the board for the Magicians yeah you have to
[5805.18s -> 5808.18s]  wonder if he should have just taken that pitch it bounced in front of the plate
[5808.18s -> 5811.90s]  maybe got a little antsy wanted to create something for his team is see
[5811.90s -> 5821.14s]  bouncing well in front of home plate it's a sand wedge to short center field
[5821.70s -> 5828.82s]  we saw some some Vlad Guerrero types theatrics earlier in this game I called
[5828.82s -> 5833.30s]  out each year oh at the time both of them have had their their call at it and
[5833.30s -> 5837.90s]  now Doug Dove looking back towards his defense oh what do we got going on here
[5837.90s -> 5844.69s]  you'll spin turn fire for a strike trying to change up the delivery here in
[5844.69s -> 5851.03s]  the California Circus now trailing eight to two they've got to start
[5851.07s -> 5854.67s]  stringing together some consecutive hits only two hits in the ball game right
[5854.67s -> 5865.79s]  now for the circus Harry helium at the dish dove very slow methodical molasses
[5865.79s -> 5871.95s]  like as he shakes off the pitch a little shimmy the EFIS is grounded toward short
[5871.95s -> 5880.23s]  charging in and the play is not made because now all of a sudden he's trying
[5880.23s -> 5883.55s]  to row row row the boat down that first baseline not enough water to get him to
[5883.55s -> 5889.75s]  first it was it was not working well you know if if maybe up Chuck had left a
[5889.75s -> 5893.95s]  trail of tears deep enough for him he could have been able to paddle his way
[5893.95s -> 5899.67s]  but it will fans another reminder this game brought to you by fans Lee a spicy
[5899.67s -> 5903.19s]  social network be sure to check out the link and chat at the paddle at the
[5903.19s -> 5907.15s]  panel below to discover exclusive content from your favorite creators right
[5907.15s -> 5912.82s]  back after this
[5982.63s -> 6336.41s]  welcome back to car shield field where the Maryland magicians own an eight to
[6336.41s -> 6340.93s]  two lead over the California Circus I'm storm Williamson alongside Gary grunt
[6340.93s -> 6346.41s]  get a look at crew chief Albertson down there on the field and this has been a
[6346.41s -> 6351.41s]  game owned by the magicians that baby card pulled out the legendary card and
[6351.41s -> 6355.13s]  the baby bib did not treat the circus well just when it looked like they were
[6355.13s -> 6359.46s]  getting some momentum three runs right back on the board to the magicians a two
[6359.46s -> 6363.82s]  lead down for the magicians a slight delay here before we start the top of
[6363.82s -> 6366.70s]  the fifth year I believe there was a bathroom break that had to be had for
[6366.70s -> 6374.90s]  some of the players so the pregame meal was some hot spicy food so I think some
[6374.90s -> 6380.18s]  players had to run to the restroom to take care of that yeah some some things
[6380.18s -> 6384.90s]  definitely that needed to be taken care of we're not sure how much of it ended up
[6384.90s -> 6392.22s]  in the dive uh-oh uh-oh look at this illusion put out the tricks now up still
[6392.22s -> 6400.62s]  pulling up still pulling oh Roy Flushman no no wait wait come on here's all this
[6400.62s -> 6408.89s]  coming from there we go the hats for bats keep bats warm
[6408.89s -> 6416.46s]  fans we want to remind you about surf shark you know what geo blocking is
[6416.46s -> 6421.94s]  Disney Plus or Netflix for example have movies for each country access should
[6421.94s -> 6426.50s]  not be tied to nationality surf shark gives you all the access you need just
[6426.50s -> 6431.98s]  connect the service and refresh the page access granted I use surf shark every
[6431.98s -> 6436.34s]  day it automatically starts up whenever I start my PC and whenever I need it I
[6436.34s -> 6440.62s]  activate it with just one click if it's good enough for storm it's good enough
[6440.62s -> 6446.50s]  for you absolutely I love me you got to love you some you oh look at this look
[6446.50s -> 6451.34s]  at this a little backhanded fake throw and it goes for a ball but you love the
[6451.34s -> 6462.26s]  idea from a Laffy Taffy yep absolutely as it is Flushman at the plate drone
[6462.26s -> 6466.86s]  screaming behind home plate and that one's taken up so Flushman has found
[6466.86s -> 6470.38s]  himself ahead in the count he's you know against Greg Taffy ahead of the comp had
[6470.38s -> 6475.82s]  a nice little pull out the ribbon trick out of the tin can oh babe has called his
[6475.82s -> 6484.26s]  shot Flushman oh right over right over the surf surf shark sign and he pops it
[6484.26s -> 6487.02s]  up in the shallow center he was just pointing to the shallow center that's
[6487.02s -> 6489.66s]  where he was pointing so that's exactly what he wanted to do and he pulls it off
[6489.66s -> 6495.22s]  the shallow centerfield pop-up so that's exactly what he wanted to do that's not
[6495.22s -> 6499.38s]  one you see executed every day no no you have to keep yourself up out like that
[6499.38s -> 6504.26s]  it's such an unselfish thing to do for your team and it takes some guts to call
[6504.26s -> 6508.66s]  that shot it's not one you see every day so I guess he said look I got this in my
[6508.66s -> 6513.70s]  back pocket no problem he left all this magic in his pre-game pre at bat routine
[6513.70s -> 6519.82s]  they're pulling all that yarn out of the can see what kind of magic mystery has
[6519.82s -> 6528.34s]  in store for us Craig gets jammed on the first pitch from behind it before it hit
[6528.38s -> 6536.94s]  the ground he's got it in his glove we're trying to get rid of his gear oh
[6536.94s -> 6543.82s]  this is why you tune into the JBA immediately out of the dugout Joy
[6543.82s -> 6559.59s]  Handsome is livid we saw the whole way that ball never touched the ground that
[6559.59s -> 6562.43s]  in glove he heard it right there from Albertson net glove at the same time
[6562.43s -> 6568.91s]  that's an hour on believable play made by a hunter sweets he's been plunked by
[6568.91s -> 6573.59s]  two pitches in this game and now some payback I think it's about the eight or
[6573.59s -> 6577.71s]  ninth warning that Albertson is given toward the magicians bench for all the
[6577.71s -> 6583.07s]  talking they've been doing got two outs here in the top of the fifth inning
[6583.07s -> 6586.67s]  nobody aboard I think it's after the 10th in or the 10th warning or someone
[6586.67s -> 6591.51s]  will get thrown out so a couple more warnings before someone gets tossed
[6591.71s -> 6596.87s]  it floats in there and it's a call strike the circus in town creating a
[6596.87s -> 6601.39s]  little magic of their own and I think you know during that bathroom break Taffy
[6601.39s -> 6605.47s]  may have drug out a little tissue with him as well
[6605.47s -> 6612.46s]  you'll toilet paper on the heel of the shoe trick huh the left handers it's
[6612.46s -> 6617.62s]  called himself out and that's the second time he's done that so Albertson is is
[6617.62s -> 6623.22s]  down to one out now in this game three outs and you're done we all know how
[6623.22s -> 6635.05s]  that works Taffy with a one-in-one count facing Ronnie Smith the pitch Ronnie
[6635.05s -> 6638.81s]  tattoos it into the gap in left center field it gets down for a base hit
[6638.81s -> 6646.38s]  another hit for the magicians good piece of hitting and what is this
[6647.58s -> 6654.26s]  that's some camaraderie there between opposing teams Wow and we'll see how
[6654.26s -> 6660.66s]  these opposing dugouts take to this as you see I do know he's a free agent at
[6660.66s -> 6663.34s]  the end of the year perhaps some collusion going on some tampering
[6663.34s -> 6667.18s]  perhaps they come play for the California Circus Harry he'll play for
[6667.18s -> 6671.82s]  the magicians anymore helium trying to plead his case over there hit sharply
[6671.82s -> 6676.86s]  towards second base another nice play made over there solid as can be all day
[6676.86s -> 6682.20s]  long for Paul Laffington we're going to break here we'll be back with the bottom
[6682.20s -> 6686.16s]  of the fifth inning when we come back eight to two Maryland on top of
[6686.16s -> 6893.49s]  California you're watching JBA action the magic out to an eight to two lead
[6893.49s -> 6900.09s]  over the California Circus you're watching JBA baseball with the bunny on
[6900.13s -> 6904.73s]  screen for you right there that's as good as it gets that's a great illusion
[6904.73s -> 6916.47s]  what was he gonna do let's see another trick sir it reminds me of the time back
[6916.47s -> 6921.45s]  in my caveman playing days where we tried to order a pizza big game and the
[6921.45s -> 6924.67s]  operator in the other end we made the call from the dugout we ordered a large
[6924.67s -> 6929.39s]  pepperoni and he said do you want that in 16 slices or in eight slices so I
[6929.39s -> 6933.75s]  said I don't think we need 16 slices let's just make it eight you know that's
[6933.75s -> 6937.87s]  that's a real a good call you would think though that the cavemen would have
[6937.87s -> 6944.31s]  the appetite to put down 16 slices but you know eight far far less pizza to eat
[6944.31s -> 6950.31s]  yes large pizza cut into eight pieces instead of 16 it's much more manageable
[6950.31s -> 6955.03s]  for a group of our the team that we had back there for the caveman certainly
[6955.03s -> 6958.59s]  certainly you know I can't wait to get the postgame report from the crunch time
[6958.59s -> 6964.89s]  and see how the caveman did today that is a really really important thing for
[6964.89s -> 6969.91s]  fans to look forward to germination we have a postgame show coming your way at
[6969.91s -> 6974.79s]  the conclusion of this one crunch time as you heard Gary grunt allude to it and
[6974.79s -> 6980.19s]  Gary on his way to the cavemen Hall of Fame and that's got to be not only a
[6980.19s -> 6983.51s]  great honor for you Gary but it's gonna be a lot of fun to go out there and be
[6983.51s -> 6987.15s]  back with the guys that you won a championship back when in 2017 with yeah
[6987.19s -> 6991.63s]  it was a great time and a great journey to be with the caveman and I'm happy to
[6991.63s -> 6996.83s]  donate my back hair to the Hall of Fame for the caveman as well so it should be
[6996.83s -> 7001.19s]  a fun ceremony libations will be had and be good to see some of my old teammates
[7001.19s -> 7006.23s]  and a lot of people don't know this but we're actually suffering in our world
[7006.23s -> 7009.63s]  today from a back hair shortage and if it weren't for people like you Gary
[7009.63s -> 7013.27s]  there there just wouldn't be enough to go around so we appreciate what you do
[7013.27s -> 7017.75s]  for the good people of not only the German Baseball Association but looking
[7017.75s -> 7021.43s]  out for the greater good as well and so it's not locks of love you know it's
[7021.43s -> 7025.55s]  curly curly hair for love is curly back hair for love is what we're trying to
[7025.55s -> 7029.23s]  do it just trying to ways awareness that you know some men out there can't grow
[7029.23s -> 7033.51s]  back hair and others like myself have some to give and just trying to help the
[7033.51s -> 7038.31s]  community make them a little hairier that's a little bit more caveman from
[7038.35s -> 7044.63s]  from the heart of our Hall of Famer Gary grunt three and one the count to Lenny
[7044.63s -> 7051.51s]  Munson you hear that that famed little grunt there from Gary and you know when
[7051.51s -> 7055.67s]  you play behind home plate there there are plenty of times where hey you got a
[7055.67s -> 7061.11s]  reach for that baseball you got to do this or that just a natural grunt it's
[7061.11s -> 7064.79s]  the job done in those situations it really started as kind of a joke as you
[7064.79s -> 7070.11s]  know as I tended to pass a lot of gas you know behind home plate so it'd be a
[7070.11s -> 7073.91s]  little loud and I didn't want Albertson to hear it so I would grunt a little bit
[7073.91s -> 7079.31s]  and then a little you know a little so he couldn't tell the difference if it
[7079.31s -> 7084.43s]  was Gary that that is a poof card that Albertson was just never ready for no
[7084.43s -> 7092.23s]  no and I had a lot of poofs in my day so check this out we got all the circus
[7092.23s -> 7096.91s]  trying to get into the Magicians dugout and a balloon fight balloon sword fight
[7096.91s -> 7102.03s]  has broken out here Albertson tried to get this under order but the circus has
[7102.03s -> 7115.48s]  broken loose is that is that poppo Schmidt poppo after being thrown out of
[7115.48s -> 7119.76s]  the game gets back out there to get involved in the in the balloon fight
[7119.76s -> 7123.04s]  the league will take notice of that once you've been ejected you come back on
[7123.04s -> 7127.08s]  the field you could face suspension so we'll see if the league wants to take a
[7127.08s -> 7131.76s]  look at that look at it Albertson even appreciates this gag here from the
[7131.76s -> 7136.28s]  circus so we'll see if if you know that positive reinforcement from our crew
[7136.28s -> 7139.80s]  chief gives them that momentum we've been talking about it for quite a while
[7139.80s -> 7144.88s]  now this is a circus team that came into this game with three more wins than the
[7144.88s -> 7149.77s]  Maryland Magicians still no outs here run around first for the California
[7149.77s -> 7154.01s]  Circus three centerfielders once again for the Magicians they imported in the
[7154.01s -> 7157.33s]  last couple innings now and I think the guys are just having a good time just
[7157.33s -> 7160.01s]  gabbing like a couple of schoolgirls out there and you know when you're up by
[7160.01s -> 7167.00s]  six a little socialization is is in play so the Magicians take advantage and look out
[7167.00s -> 7174.24s]  another hit batter look out oh false alarm false alarm and you know that was that was a
[7174.24s -> 7180.00s]  really aggressive run towards the mound by Paul Laffington he took a 90 degree
[7180.00s -> 7186.12s]  turn towards first pace right as he got close to our picture Victor vanish on the
[7186.12s -> 7191.00s]  mound for the Maryland Magicians and decided to make a no laughing matter for
[7191.00s -> 7196.52s]  Laughington as we now have runners on first and second for the California
[7196.52s -> 7204.19s]  Circus they'll try and trapeze themselves into a couple of runs here a
[7204.19s -> 7209.77s]  catapulting effort would be the one that they're looking for right now and here
[7209.77s -> 7220.79s]  comes Fred Big Top and now he's joined with Joy Hansel now look Joy clearly has
[7220.79s -> 7224.75s]  the better looks and he's going to try to demoralize Fred Big Top call him a
[7224.75s -> 7239.43s]  crybaby there you saw the crybaby motion I was just gonna say move for the
[7239.63s -> 7247.95s]  power move on top of the power car being played this other coach must wear a bag
[7247.95s -> 7253.23s]  on his head for the rest of the inning so the bulk managers go at it and the
[7253.23s -> 7258.95s]  circus manager pulls out the lights out car and this is the type of stuff that
[7258.95s -> 7264.67s]  has Fred Big Top in the discussion for manager of the year in the JBA this year
[7264.67s -> 7271.27s]  look at this he shoves joy handsome down to the turf and now personally goes
[7271.27s -> 7278.50s]  over to put the bag on his head emphatically coach is definitely in the
[7278.50s -> 7296.12s]  bag now as that was bag tastic Elbertson the manager getting it into it with one
[7296.12s -> 7304.08s]  of the fans the magician fans near the dugout so you got to wonder how the
[7304.12s -> 7311.10s]  magicians manager can manage this game he can't see right now so see what kind of
[7311.10s -> 7316.06s]  defense he wants to implement as you can see the shot right there he is in the
[7316.06s -> 7323.66s]  bag right now can't see he's got his bag but you know his his outfielder is still
[7323.66s -> 7328.10s]  on that same page they are just doing whatever they want out there and you
[7328.10s -> 7332.34s]  know that was that was pre bag on the head as well so maybe the magicians have
[7332.38s -> 7344.02s]  just been in their bag this entire time. Good pitch. Taffy tips it into the mitt
[7344.02s -> 7350.60s]  there Vanish feeling himself after that delivery and Vanish does like to feel
[7350.60s -> 7356.73s]  himself a lot although he seems to disappear rather quickly we have seen a
[7356.73s -> 7360.33s]  lot of hit batters in this game check behind the runner at second base it
[7360.33s -> 7364.61s]  bounces off of the shortstop and stays right in his general vicinity so thought
[7364.61s -> 7369.17s]  that one was going to center field is it looked like it took a bad hop there
[7369.17s -> 7374.97s]  you're going to look at this from the knees Donovan Slate is in a straight
[7374.97s -> 7380.33s]  jacket at second base so you know double play situation that's going to make it
[7380.33s -> 7384.41s]  really tough to turn very tough but we've seen the likes of a player with
[7384.41s -> 7389.25s]  his caliber make good plays with his feet and kick the ball over nicely so no
[7389.25s -> 7394.23s]  stranger to the straight jacket and that's something that the JBA really
[7394.27s -> 7399.79s]  brings out is you know you watch players in regular baseball leagues and it's
[7399.79s -> 7403.67s]  it's just not that impressive the skill set does not need to be that wide you
[7403.67s -> 7407.15s]  better run backwards in this league get a fly ball out into center field all
[7407.15s -> 7410.75s]  three of them have a look at it the center center fielder chucked his glove
[7410.75s -> 7414.39s]  but didn't come up with it it's the left center fielder with the play yeah and
[7414.39s -> 7417.83s]  they fire home to keep the runners put a selfish play by the center center
[7417.83s -> 7421.91s]  fielder they're trying to make the play without his glove trying to put a hex on
[7421.91s -> 7425.71s]  the glove to make that catch you'll see it right here the guy in the center of
[7425.71s -> 7431.83s]  the center field almost caught it but the left center fielder got it and made
[7431.83s -> 7439.59s]  the out two down here bag is still on oh my goodness
[7439.59s -> 7448.59s]  trichotomous this is a game-breaker all runs now we're three in this half inning
[7448.59s -> 7456.30s]  wow this could easily put the circus right back into this game should we get
[7456.30s -> 7461.94s]  a base hit here game tying run standing at second base with only one out here
[7461.94s -> 7467.02s]  in the bottom of the fifth inning and all the while joy handsome has a bag
[7467.02s -> 7475.97s]  over his head hunter sweets like candy is got a golden opportunity for the
[7475.97s -> 7480.85s]  California circus right here hunter sweets came to the plate as the leadoff
[7480.85s -> 7484.81s]  man for the circus in the bottom of the first inning hit by a pitch on an o2
[7484.81s -> 7489.53s]  count came up in his second at bat in the third with an o2 count he was hit by
[7489.53s -> 7493.69s]  the pitch and here he grabs it and he's gonna fire it deep in the right field
[7493.69s -> 7501.41s]  and it's off the glove of the right fielder and they are rounding second and third one run comes home
[7501.41s -> 7510.27s]  that's three and another three we're tied what I don't even know what to call that he snatched
[7510.27s -> 7517.55s]  that right out of thin air hunter sweets literally a circus catches it and launches
[7517.55s -> 7524.55s]  this ball the right center unbelievable play by a hunter sweets that is not
[7524.55s -> 7529.51s]  something you see every day and what a risky play to jump out in front of the
[7529.51s -> 7534.43s]  plate if you do not grab that cleanly disaster breaks loose in an inning where
[7534.43s -> 7539.87s]  all runs count for three enjoy handsome wants to protest this call but he can't
[7539.87s -> 7543.47s]  even find Elbertson with the bag on his head he didn't even see it he's just
[7543.47s -> 7547.91s]  being told what happened and he's trying to figure out that the legal player not
[7547.91s -> 7553.11s]  I think I was gonna let it go it's not buying this argument I mean you have to
[7553.11s -> 7557.51s]  you have to come with the sync logical argument and handsome just never got a
[7557.51s -> 7562.63s]  look at that play six runs scored off of the base hit what a time again the
[7562.63s -> 7566.95s]  power cards have been played at the exact right time the exact right moment
[7566.95s -> 7573.15s]  they have made a huge impact in this game playing the run card is sweet for
[7573.15s -> 7582.18s]  sweets aren't we all sir aren't we all what a play unbelievable and now the go
[7582.18s -> 7588.14s]  ahead three runs standing on second base right for Percy polka dot chance to take
[7588.14s -> 7595.16s]  the lead here for the circus he takes ball one Percy polka dot walked earlier
[7595.16s -> 7602.56s]  in this game starting to turn into the greatest show here it's great to show on
[7602.56s -> 7611.25s]  dirt or turf and dirt turf pellets pellets bounce towards third base
[7611.25s -> 7618.25s]  charging hard off balance the throw is spiked three more runs will come home this
[7618.73s -> 7628.09s]  circus have the lead a level a nine-run inning on three runs scored has the
[7628.09s -> 7633.29s]  circus on top I've been reading the comments and a lot of folks out there
[7633.29s -> 7638.65s]  really didn't think that the circus was gonna go away and sure enough right back
[7638.65s -> 7644.13s]  in this thing with the lead Fred Big Top one of the best in the business for a
[7644.17s -> 7650.57s]  reason pulls two power cards out of his back pocket the timing just
[7650.57s -> 7656.01s]  scintillating here in the bottom of the fifth a three run lead now for California
[7656.01s -> 7660.77s]  11 to 8 the second baseman for the magicians doing getting a little bit
[7660.77s -> 7666.29s]  more free out of that straight jacket and you know that's that's a frustrating
[7666.29s -> 7670.61s]  situation partner I know you've been hit with that straight jacket a few times in
[7670.61s -> 7674.29s]  your playing days it gets a little claustrophobic by the end of the inning
[7674.29s -> 7678.21s]  it's tough to get off but there is a secret obviously this player doesn't
[7678.21s -> 7682.89s]  know and it's a secret of the pros that we like to call of oh that's a terrible
[7682.89s -> 7687.89s]  throw David Hawk goes down for it golfs it out and that one has been thrown out
[7687.89s -> 7692.49s]  of the ballpark I hope there's some insurance on that van over there you may
[7692.49s -> 7699.28s]  have drilled it that was an Aaron throw just took off on the center-center
[7699.52s -> 7705.08s]  fielder and he might have an insurance bill coming his way that's that ball
[7705.08s -> 7710.36s]  cleared the entire stance let's see if we get a shot of the card almost hit oh
[7710.36s -> 7716.08s]  oh my gosh what a what a look from our production crew here great camera work
[7716.08s -> 7726.09s]  out there center field Jerma baseball as professional as it gets oh he's trying
[7726.09s -> 7733.29s]  to stay on first base here he's out but trying to oh and oh he's out look at
[7733.29s -> 7736.05s]  him he's got out of the straight jacket just in time to play some defense with
[7736.05s -> 7740.09s]  two outs left and there was some confusion over who's gonna be on first
[7740.09s -> 7746.49s]  base look like that polka dot trying to or was honk excuse me standing up first
[7746.49s -> 7752.85s]  base didn't think that they forgot the crew chief Albertson is well in control
[7752.89s -> 7757.09s]  of this game he's letting everyone know also a great job by the second baseman
[7757.09s -> 7763.45s]  for the magicians to get out of that straight jacket now he's an integral
[7763.45s -> 7768.97s]  part once again of this defense look at the form from Albertson pure athlete
[7768.97s -> 7772.81s]  makes you wonder how he's not on this field playing right now absolutely could
[7772.81s -> 7785.41s]  easily be play for either one of these oh my goodness he got two of them two
[7785.41s -> 7791.13s]  for one fan is not happy picks up his trash and throws it towards Albertson and
[7791.13s -> 7795.13s]  exits the game as he's now been thrown out so Albertson has issued a lot of
[7795.13s -> 7798.81s]  warnings his first ejection of the game except me excuse me second ejection of
[7798.81s -> 7803.77s]  the game this time a fan that's correct we saw Papa tossed earlier in the game
[7803.77s -> 7808.37s]  he did come back out of the dugout in the balloon fight that we saw earlier and
[7808.37s -> 7812.89s]  we want to remind everyone this is all going on with a bag on top of joy
[7812.89s -> 7816.61s]  handsome the head coach of the Maryland Magicians set yeah I can't see what's
[7816.61s -> 7820.97s]  happening can't employ any shifts in the defense can't give his pitcher a signal
[7820.97s -> 7827.01s]  all I could do is listen and clap and not only that it here Gary grunt future
[7827.01s -> 7832.33s]  Hall of Famer for the Phoenix cavemen you can't make the necessary adjustments
[7832.33s -> 7837.65s]  as vanish pulls the hidden ball trick oh he's got it in his glove what's
[7837.65s -> 7847.39s]  Albertson gonna come it's a strikeout what an illusion for the Magicians now
[7847.39s -> 7853.39s]  you see it now you don't and you're out Victor vanish out of nowhere he gets
[7853.43s -> 7861.79s]  them out of the pickle still a three-run game the california circus Oh big top
[7861.79s -> 7867.11s]  absolutely hates it we'll see what he thinks in the sixth inning we'll be
[7867.11s -> 7870.87s]  back after this on JVA
[7955.72s -> 7957.78s]  you
[8055.34s -> 8130.50s]  come back to car shield field this is the German Baseball Association I am
[8130.50s -> 8136.54s]  Scott Williamson joined by future Hall of Famer from the cavemen Gary grunt and
[8136.54s -> 8141.98s]  carry a nine run inning for the circus to jump back on top 11 to 8 all started
[8142.02s -> 8145.94s]  with that power card being played meaning that each run that was scored
[8145.94s -> 8150.38s]  would count as three runs and hit three runs across the board so three times
[8150.38s -> 8155.66s]  three is nine they are now in the lead 11 day and how about the big-time play
[8155.66s -> 8162.08s]  that we had behind home plate it was a diving catch made falling into the
[8162.08s -> 8169.22s]  screen by Roy Flushman and or excuse me it was it was made by rather see that
[8169.22s -> 8174.74s]  was Hunter sweets who made that play in in the dugout for the Magicians joy
[8174.74s -> 8179.22s]  handsome had no shot of arguing the call he had a bag over his head he could not
[8179.22s -> 8184.42s]  see anything that was going on trickery going on here now on our screen
[8184.42s -> 8193.14s]  bird oh yeah oh and the suck it okay okay all right the double bird suck it
[8193.18s -> 8198.54s]  and now some teepee being flowed on our on the field
[8198.54s -> 8207.02s]  haven't done that oh another one another clown toss didn't like the toll paper on
[8207.02s -> 8214.31s]  the field I think that I think he was trying to throw him at the umpires been
[8214.31s -> 8218.71s]  shit tonight so I think that's why I was trying to throw the teepee on the field
[8218.71s -> 8229.48s]  let him know to wipe it up roll in hand you know he was praising the the circus
[8229.48s -> 8234.04s]  earlier for how funny they were with their antics now that it's directed at
[8234.04s -> 8238.56s]  Elbertson he's not so happy about it and you know I hate to bring this up here
[8238.56s -> 8243.60s]  Gary Grunt but is this maybe a little too much ego from Elbertson here yeah we
[8243.60s -> 8248.20s]  stand it from time to time where some buttons could be pushed and that's just
[8248.20s -> 8251.92s]  the wrong button to push for Albertson and he didn't appreciate the gesture
[8251.92s -> 8259.22s]  that he's been shit tonight laffy taffy brings it home it's in there for a call
[8259.22s -> 8264.10s]  strike Albertson you know he spent a long time in that bathroom between innings
[8264.10s -> 8269.10s]  and you have to say it's well timed from California you can't be that upset I'm
[8269.10s -> 8272.06s]  thinking it was at least a four or five flusher for Albertson because he was in
[8272.06s -> 8276.34s]  there way too long and and let's hope that he dropped in a couple of curtsy
[8276.34s -> 8279.94s]  flushes because we saw his free game meal and that was probably a stinky
[8279.94s -> 8284.06s]  stinky poo poo and you know on the year Albertson is is averaging two point
[8284.06s -> 8289.86s]  seven three flushes per dump and if he exceeded that amount you have to say
[8289.86s -> 8294.34s]  that is pretty warranted from California yeah you don't want too many bowel
[8294.34s -> 8305.92s]  movements and we'll see how the umpire responds here mr. Albertson pitch comes
[8305.96s -> 8312.28s]  in and it's a ball low and outside this is Mike Salmon at the plate we saw him
[8312.28s -> 8318.14s]  back his way over to first base for a single and runner off with the pitch it
[8318.14s -> 8323.42s]  is fouled out of play to the right side so a stolen base attempt make sure that
[8323.42s -> 8330.74s]  more information stays safe use promo code Jerma to get 83% off three extra
[8330.74s -> 8336.14s]  months for free of surf shark they offer a 30-day money back guarantee so there's
[8336.14s -> 8341.62s]  no risk surf with your own set of rules that is surf shark use the promo code

[8350.17s -> 8355.37s]  as well to count to two and one nobody out and one man on or the magicians here
[8355.37s -> 8359.33s]  in the top of the sixth let's see what kind of response the magicians have here
[8359.33s -> 8366.06s]  is trailing by three now after that big inning runner on the move again the
[8366.46s -> 8382.54s]  fifth don't have to send him right back to first base bedazzle Mike Salmon five
[8382.54s -> 8391.50s]  foot ten hundred ninety pounds a 291 hitter including that base hit today the
[8391.50s -> 8396.34s]  two-two pitch put on the ground towards short this could be two to second base
[8396.34s -> 8401.42s]  for one laughington turns around one hopper to first and just not quite in
[8401.42s -> 8408.30s]  time as thought about so yeah out and safe out at second base safe at first
[8408.30s -> 8412.74s]  base the official call from Albert sentence trying to regain control is
[8412.74s -> 8418.12s]  well is he trying to dry his you know a little swamp ass in the behind the plate
[8418.12s -> 8423.52s]  right now and you know we talked about that being you know one of your signature
[8423.52s -> 8429.48s]  moves the swamp this can be really a game-changer and the magicians are at
[8429.68s -> 8439.20s]  again oh my gosh endless amounts of Kleenex I mean that's Donnie strange
[8439.20s -> 8444.08s]  they might want to say that I give it to mr. or umpire Albertson that maybe soak
[8444.08s -> 8447.88s]  up some of that swamp ass he's got rocking hunter sweets is feeling a
[8447.88s -> 8456.50s]  little sour after that so now strange will step in and try to come up with a
[8456.50s -> 8464.54s]  hit one out in the end it's all strange and BP taking some big hacks he's
[8464.54s -> 8468.30s]  swung and miss it around five in a row and make some contact here so we were
[8468.30s -> 8473.90s]  wondering what kind of adjustments strange would make he did not look good
[8473.90s -> 8480.76s]  and BP made contact there certainly an integral part for the magicians and
[8480.76s -> 8486.60s]  worked there by the ball clown the ball clown really for my money he has been
[8486.60s -> 8491.32s]  the best execution of anyone tonight yeah time and time again he comes up
[8491.32s -> 8495.40s]  same form exactly I was just gonna say he's not afraid to take that extra step
[8495.40s -> 8498.96s]  make sure he's in the right position to hand the balls to Albertson yeah it does
[8498.96s -> 8503.28s]  a nice job of getting to Albertson to dug out oh nearly took his head off taffy
[8503.28s -> 8511.35s]  ducking for cover and that would have been a colorful experience had that come
[8511.35s -> 8520.21s]  to fruition another look strange just rips the cover off that ball and taffy
[8520.25s -> 8530.64s]  do nothing but duck out of the way big chance here for the magicians to get
[8530.64s -> 8534.12s]  back in this all they need is a three run shot I have to wonder if they I
[8534.12s -> 8537.20s]  don't know how many power cards have been played for them as it's one spring
[8537.20s -> 8544.20s]  in the way just inside the line of fair ball one run coming home here comes the
[8544.20s -> 8549.44s]  second getting the wave around third headed towards third base himself Xavier
[8549.44s -> 8554.80s]  make magic and as he chugs the beer he's coming home he sucks the can at the
[8554.80s -> 8563.04s]  catcher and scores and dabs what a spray chart this guy has knocks it down the
[8563.04s -> 8568.72s]  left field wall three runs scored and we are tied 11 11 of the top of the six
[8568.72s -> 8575.36s]  what a great job of hitting right here going oppo field check that spray chart
[8575.36s -> 8583.68s]  that was done that hooked him up and we know old dougie has had his way with the
[8583.68s -> 8587.88s]  elixir throughout this game he knew exactly what make magic needed that
[8587.88s -> 8592.28s]  extra oomph to get him across home plate we are all tied he did that feel good
[8592.28s -> 8597.04s]  juice and they've been anytime that something specials happen for the
[8597.04s -> 8601.67s]  magicians that feel good juice has been a part of it to hopper to third no
[8601.67s -> 8607.43s]  problem over there for giggles and Sean put it in the dirt tag is applied and
[8607.43s -> 8617.43s]  German with the emphatic call for chief Albertson now we can see handsome can
[8617.43s -> 8624.30s]  see now and doing the the swan the swan move the figure skating swan move as
[8624.30s -> 8628.46s]  he's trying to tell him that he swan dive this see the initial play here is
[8628.46s -> 8633.90s]  bobbled but a great recovery and right there the tag is applied and you can see
[8633.90s -> 8638.14s]  the ball we're going to move down that line by the runner trying to evade the
[8638.14s -> 8644.14s]  tag or the tag and just couldn't and that is the kind of call that ends up
[8644.14s -> 8649.66s]  getting crew chief Albertson into the championship game to be the the crew
[8649.66s -> 8655.90s]  chief time and time again just a big big play he's all over all over it good call
[8655.90s -> 8664.38s]  by Albertson Dumbledore really hates it but look at that just loading on the
[8664.38s -> 8675.82s]  other side and this one's stung past the shortstop a tough hop Roy Fluschman
[8675.82s -> 8683.83s]  caught it flush been a lot of flushes here tonight between the bathroom and
[8683.83s -> 8689.47s]  flushman there really have and that's another thing that we've got to really
[8689.59s -> 8695.87s]  take into account here are these restrooms still usable by the ninth
[8695.87s -> 8700.15s]  inning we're just hoping for our fans sake that we can get through this one
[8700.15s -> 8705.99s]  yeah maybe get a plumber in here to pipe the you know what right out of this
[8705.99s -> 8710.71s]  field well we know Roy's a little bit busy but we'll see if he can get some
[8710.71s -> 8716.45s]  some help for us out here first pitch to mystery and he puts it through the hole
[8716.45s -> 8720.94s]  between first and second two outs in the inning and two runners now for the
[8720.94s -> 8724.14s]  Magicians that mystery is taking some good at bats here extends the inning for
[8724.14s -> 8727.74s]  the Magicians they're trying to get a rally here they led for a majority of
[8727.74s -> 8732.58s]  this game the circus came back with nine runs in the fifth inning and a good
[8732.58s -> 8735.70s]  response here by the Magicians already putting up three they have two on with
[8735.70s -> 8743.57s]  two out now with a big-time hitter coming to the plate Smith Ronnie Smith
[8743.57s -> 8749.50s]  singled back in the fifth inning he's won for two today the pitch from Taffy
[8749.82s -> 8761.50s]  bounces low and away new ballgame as we are into the sixth inning all kinds of
[8761.50s -> 8769.06s]  scoring in the last two frames the last two innings in particular nine runs in
[8769.06s -> 8773.02s]  the bottom of the last inning this is bounced back up the middle shift on with
[8773.02s -> 8777.90s]  the runner or with the fielder excuse me covering at second base and with the
[8777.90s -> 8783.50s]  foot on the bag that is out number three we go to the bottom of the six we're all
[8783.50s -> 8876.81s]  tied at 11 you're watching the German Baseball Association all tied at 11 look
[8876.81s -> 8881.41s]  at all that scoring in the last two and a half innings out here at car shield

[8910.13s -> 8913.93s]  last half inning of work despite the nine runs being put up on the board
[8913.93s -> 8917.61s]  because of a power card and now we've got another yep the upgrade it's a rare
[8917.61s -> 8921.29s]  card being played right now by the Magicians it replaced bats with a much
[8921.29s -> 8925.49s]  larger bat with more service area for this half inning so it's more of a club
[8925.49s -> 8932.09s]  that they'll be using a caveman club and Gary you might have I had the inside
[8932.09s -> 8936.21s]  info on how to use this correct as with my favorite bat to use when I was
[8936.21s -> 8942.49s]  playing for the caveman it's the obviously thick bat I used to call mine
[8942.49s -> 8947.21s]  the Fred Flintstone because it was just made of bedrock and could really put
[8947.21s -> 8950.17s]  some power behind the ball and that's where I why I hit a lot of home runs
[8950.17s -> 8957.17s]  over my career playing for the caveman so they were implemented that bat cup
[8957.17s -> 8960.41s]  check here to make sure it works I don't think actually he's wearing a cup he's
[8960.41s -> 8964.37s]  just beating himself with balls right now and you know what sometimes you get
[8964.37s -> 8968.23s]  to the bottom of the sixth inning and you need a good shot between the legs to
[8968.23s -> 8971.85s]  wake you up the pace of play has slowed a little bit with all the scoring that
[8971.85s -> 8976.31s]  we've had here lately and a nice shot to the nuts wake you up right away as we
[8976.35s -> 8980.51s]  have number 69 Manny Upchuck coming to the plate and we talked about so much
[8980.51s -> 8985.19s]  when you use this club the hair to bat ratio has to be correct and it looks
[8985.19s -> 8991.85s]  pretty good here first pitch swinging throw up the line was the tag applied
[8991.85s -> 8998.87s]  yes what a defensive play the club does not pull through there for the circus
[8998.87s -> 9006.15s]  oh the comedy live motion for the swipe just like in his playing days
[9006.15s -> 9012.45s]  Elbertson like it was yesterday yeah yeah former first baseman turned umpire
[9012.45s -> 9017.37s]  used to call him scoops of the field while the deer and now they're scooping
[9017.37s -> 9022.37s]  something else up back in the bathroom after the debacle that we had a while
[9022.37s -> 9026.77s]  ago again we apologize to you fans that's just something we can't control
[9026.77s -> 9031.37s]  you know and it's one of those things it'll catch up to Elbertson what maybe
[9031.37s -> 9036.61s]  once every five games or so and he just needs that extended time in between
[9036.61s -> 9039.97s]  innings so forgot to take the money made he's got a little runs his jeans right
[9039.97s -> 9044.69s]  now so that's right so now Harry helium oh man he's feeling so there's a juice
[9044.69s -> 9051.42s]  and feel good juice oh boy vanish here we go what kind of illusion are we gonna
[9051.42s -> 9060.38s]  see a two swagger look out and behind inside g-double-o-d-e-y-e-o Torkin oh
[9060.38s -> 9066.46s]  there's the beer man beer man and the booty yeah now he's the hot dog man out
[9066.46s -> 9070.10s]  on the field showing bunt I don't know if you want to bump oh and he takes a
[9070.10s -> 9076.26s]  strike nasty slider there from vanish oh Elbertson thought about running over to
[9076.26s -> 9078.34s]  the magician's bench I guess we're still chirping there
[9078.34s -> 9086.22s]  yeah of his mind and meanwhile vanish is just hammering this beer on the mount
[9086.22s -> 9090.70s]  beer man's got them all ready for the next inning that one comes in letter
[9090.70s -> 9093.94s]  high call strike I was that the homeless guy is the beer guy the homeless guy
[9093.94s -> 9096.66s]  from happy Gilmore because that's what it looks like and you know what that
[9096.66s -> 9101.90s]  that homeless guy needs some more love because he has provided so many of
[9101.90s -> 9107.70s]  these magicians with the tools necessary those tools being that magic elixir
[9107.74s -> 9112.82s]  magic elixir it's working now as the count is back in the favor of vanish it's
[9112.82s -> 9118.90s]  one and two could use a strikeout here highlight kick the fish the helium and
[9118.90s -> 9123.78s]  it caught him in the front thigh whoa well the ball yes they said it didn't
[9123.78s -> 9127.70s]  hit it didn't look at this it did look no argument from helium he wants to use
[9127.70s -> 9135.22s]  this club yeah it looked like he was gonna trot down first base but he
[9135.22s -> 9140.54s]  avoided the pitch just barely I thought maybe he got his pants but Elbertson
[9140.54s -> 9144.94s]  says no ran it in on him and you could hear the loud crack of the bat chucks
[9144.94s -> 9149.62s]  it in vanish and look at this he's gonna get a word from helium oh he tosses him
[9149.62s -> 9158.10s]  from the game just just when you thought you had some sportsmanship vanish
[9158.10s -> 9161.94s]  vanishes from the handshake yeah he went in there for the handshake say it's all
[9161.94s -> 9167.95s]  good psych see ya did the hair slick back oh and you wonder if this is Harry
[9167.95s -> 9173.31s]  helium again he has really been trying to coax some of these magicians to join
[9173.31s -> 9177.99s]  the circus and upcoming helium has been tossed from this game oh my gosh he has
[9177.99s -> 9182.19s]  seen he has been good guy helium throughout this contest and he's been
[9182.19s -> 9192.03s]  high as a kite now he's at the lowest close throwing out of this game oh look
[9192.03s -> 9198.47s]  at this oh push up off okay and as a former player Gary grunt how do you
[9198.47s -> 9202.75s]  break that for not sure of the form there the pump was a little too low for
[9202.75s -> 9206.03s]  my like and look at this Elbertson and try again he's got to do it again yeah
[9206.03s -> 9209.91s]  look at this we got too much booty action in the back yeah it's like a big
[9209.91s -> 9215.21s]  castle but it's not low enough no there we go that's a little bit is accepting
[9215.21s -> 9222.15s]  these back in okay he did get the necessary amount of push-ups okay he's
[9222.15s -> 9227.95s]  back in so helium is high once again and you know what not
[9227.99s -> 9233.19s]  everyone can manage ten push-ups at a time especially if you're high the way
[9233.19s -> 9238.63s]  that Harry helium is right now that would have been a big loss for the circus
[9238.63s -> 9244.15s]  if helium left this game but thankfully he's able to keep his cardio up treats
[9244.15s -> 9248.47s]  the body right and not only that his good nature will will continue throughout
[9248.47s -> 9251.71s]  this game it appears that that our shortstop has gotten enough of this
[9251.71s -> 9256.79s]  elixir in his energy is spread into the outfield there are no shirts on for half
[9256.79s -> 9261.19s]  of our defense right now for the magic yeah it's a it's a warm night it's cooled
[9261.19s -> 9264.51s]  off just a little bit but you know with all the drinking that the magicians have
[9264.51s -> 9269.88s]  been doing it can't get a little sweaty out there so nice little dance there
[9269.88s -> 9276.04s]  from the shortstop yeah we got we got some you know when the shirts come off
[9276.04s -> 9282.56s]  you've got to give the female audience something to really write home about you
[9282.56s -> 9285.52s]  got to give him a reason to tune in again one of the reasons why the JVA
[9285.56s -> 9290.80s]  does it better than anyone that's a fair ball down the line takes a weird bounce
[9290.80s -> 9295.04s]  off the wall this is Lenny Munson headed into second base with a stand-up
[9295.04s -> 9302.12s]  two-out double Munson with a great hit nice double down that left field side of
[9302.12s -> 9306.56s]  course all players are using the club here the bat best known for from the
[9306.56s -> 9314.44s]  caveman someone got a hold of them and you know what that's celebratory clown
[9314.48s -> 9318.72s]  music that starts going can be a bit unnerving for the opponents that's when
[9318.72s -> 9326.01s]  California starts to feel it securities digging it and we're equal opportunity
[9326.01s -> 9334.30s]  beer man a beer man here and we can't forget that you know shirts off can go
[9334.30s -> 9341.77s]  both ways so wild pitch allows the runner to advance from second to third
[9341.77s -> 9350.63s]  and that's something else to keep in mind here we saw that hot start for the
[9350.67s -> 9355.43s]  Maryland magicians and that elixir you know it brings you a good boost initially
[9355.43s -> 9360.47s]  do they start to lose it as this game goes along as that elixir takes more
[9360.47s -> 9363.35s]  effect I think that's why you just keep drinking it you know the more elixir you
[9363.35s -> 9369.51s]  take the better you get you know the more elixir you have within your system
[9369.51s -> 9373.35s]  the more chance you're gonna be able to put up some runs put up some big time
[9373.35s -> 9377.63s]  hits and Gary correct me if I'm wrong but it's the decision-making that that
[9377.67s -> 9381.19s]  elixir you know if you don't have enough of it you can't make the right decisions
[9381.19s -> 9385.27s]  out there as we see a bunt attempt push foul at the first base side count to one
[9385.27s -> 9393.15s]  and two says Paul Laffington at the plate hitting 308 now on the year I did
[9393.15s -> 9398.75s]  notice that some of those shots the the cleanliness and the smoothness of the
[9398.75s -> 9401.83s]  bodies as you see there no hair whatsoever those guys would not make
[9401.83s -> 9406.75s]  the caveman no they wouldn't and that's why you see them here on the their
[9407.23s -> 9415.91s]  they are manscaped not the only thing that razor went to work on as this is
[9415.91s -> 9420.35s]  bounced back in front of the plate vanish underhand flips to the bag at
[9420.35s -> 9426.35s]  first force out and tag applied for the end of the inning we go to the seventh
[9426.35s -> 9432.23s]  we're all tied at 11 we'll be right back with more germa baseball association
[9663.96s -> 9665.96s]  oh
[9672.96s -> 9689.81s]  switch yourself up with a fuck you turn me off I know it's just a figure of speech
[9689.81s -> 9696.60s]  but don't you know how to feel just as hard as tattooing when it's this one's
[9696.60s -> 9716.46s]  burning up my skin inside of my heart till the end of time I'll be fire fire
[9716.46s -> 9720.81s]  cuz you're my human life
[9720.81s -> 9766.28s]  welcome back to car shield field where we are tied at 11 we got a baseball game
[9766.28s -> 9770.84s]  going on between the lines but meanwhile in the dugout a fight has broken loose
[9770.84s -> 9774.96s]  yeah back in the locker room right now the mascots have been going at it for
[9774.96s -> 9779.96s]  quite some time it's like a WWE battle is broken out oh chair right to the nuts
[9779.96s -> 9786.56s]  ouch excuse me a trash can to the nuts that's never good no doubt about it and
[9786.56s -> 9790.72s]  you know that I wouldn't wish a trash can to the nuts on anybody and not only
[9790.72s -> 9794.68s]  that that's again one of those momentum changes in this game you know that your
[9794.68s -> 9798.28s]  mascot has just been blown to smithereens down in the dugout that
[9798.28s -> 9803.76s]  that's a big shot to the spirit of your squad look at that laughy taffy as he
[9803.76s -> 9808.12s]  comes out with the pitch and we got a couple of clowns right behind old plate
[9808.12s -> 9812.52s]  yeah the ball clowns are on the field trying to create havoc one just sitting
[9812.52s -> 9816.00s]  enjoying some peanuts and crackerjacks yeah he's got his crackerjacks out there
[9816.00s -> 9820.92s]  this is the backup ball clown is playing over there's a crackerjack ball clown
[9820.92s -> 9827.12s]  oh it looks like cheese it's not sure if those are extra crunchy or not but look
[9827.12s -> 9831.12s]  like some cheese it's being had there there's outstanding stuff one of the
[9831.12s -> 9835.20s]  best snacks in the snack universe he leans into that one and Albertsons all
[9835.20s -> 9842.14s]  over it look at this oh no is he going he is going to award him first base
[9842.14s -> 9851.29s]  sweets is giving his argument from behind home plate look at this taffy's
[9851.29s -> 9855.01s]  coming at him taffy's trying to get that out but they never want to see a player
[9855.01s -> 9859.81s]  go after the referee and if we let taffy know how many times the Albertsons been
[9859.81s -> 9865.57s]  running to the bathroom he may not want to get too close yeah exactly you end up
[9865.57s -> 9872.93s]  tackling that man and you could get back to your feet with all kinds of mess and
[9872.93s -> 9877.29s]  we got another player thrown out look at this two of them are we gonna have
[9877.29s -> 9881.01s]  enough players for the clown or the circus they are running finishes game
[9881.01s -> 9885.89s]  they are running very thin at this point I believe right now they are at the
[9885.89s -> 9893.61s]  minimum for active players it is a total of meditation going on ten players
[9893.61s -> 9902.49s]  right now for the circus someone is trying to realign his center and find
[9902.49s -> 9908.13s]  his cheek Fred circus Fred circus has come out of the pen there's the right
[9908.13s -> 9914.66s]  fielder just standing up all that's good balance there not only good balance we
[9914.66s -> 9917.54s]  talked about you know some of the outfielders for the magicians not
[9917.54s -> 9922.70s]  staying engaged kind of taking a nap out there especially on left field you're
[9922.70s -> 9927.06s]  balancing on that box who ball you have no choice another player the ball one
[9927.06s -> 9930.62s]  of the ball clowns one of the three ball clowns he took the cheese it's cheese it
[9930.62s -> 9933.70s]  look out he's got that hey those are white cheddar cheese it's taken easy put
[9933.70s -> 9940.12s]  those in my red my second place so the ball clown has been tossed wait a second
[9940.12s -> 9945.28s]  is is that your salary for this game was supposed to be a box of white cheddar
[9945.28s -> 9948.68s]  cheese it is that the box supposed to be one of the parting gifts absolutely I
[9948.68s -> 9953.68s]  better not be my cheese it's I don't know if we're ever gonna get Gary grunt
[9953.68s -> 9957.48s]  back into this booth if he does not leave this venue without his cheese it's
[9957.48s -> 9967.21s]  in my contract box cheese it's every game for postgame meal and some people
[9967.21s -> 9972.01s]  said just an elixir storm huh hey you know some people said cavemen were dumb
[9972.01s -> 9978.17s]  no hey we met sign language pop to second base oh he's gonna let about he
[9978.17s -> 9982.99s]  wants to get the lead runner here oh look at the trickery as they get the
[9982.99s -> 9988.57s]  force smart play no clowning around out there right now great play by the second
[9988.57s -> 9994.50s]  baseman really well done that's David Honk who has shifted over to second
[9994.50s -> 10002.30s]  base he started this game out in center field it shows the diversity for the
[10002.30s -> 10009.09s]  circus first pitch comes high and inside off and stealing second base it is a
[10009.09s -> 10016.41s]  stolen base out there for the magicians and a reminder that if you want both
[10016.41s -> 10020.89s]  protection and freedom online that same kind of protection that you saw there
[10020.89s -> 10024.97s]  sliding in safely to second base click the link in the description and use code
[10024.97s -> 10031.65s]  Jerma it only gives you a whopping 83% off the regular price but also three
[10031.65s -> 10039.45s]  months of service totally for free that's surf shark oh is this we've got a
[10039.45s -> 10044.97s]  streaker we've got a streaker ladies and gentlemen he came up through the quad
[10044.97s -> 10049.97s]  through the gymnasium outside the field and onto the ball field now oh my
[10049.97s -> 10056.17s]  goodness you've got to be kidding me and you know what it for for any of those
[10056.17s -> 10062.53s]  fans Lee fans out there this is the type of stuff that you dream of the kind
[10062.53s -> 10067.65s]  of content that this man is going to have on his page is unmatched as he
[10067.65s -> 10072.73s]  slides in safely in the securities chasing after him and he just cannot get
[10072.73s -> 10077.57s]  anywhere near him look at it look at the speed from this streaker security he's
[10077.57s -> 10080.05s]  got to get in the gym yeah it's something written on his chest and
[10080.05s -> 10085.87s]  something about fans Lee so obviously a big fan wanting people to come to his
[10085.87s -> 10090.03s]  page to see his content he's in the dugout right now we'll see if he makes
[10090.03s -> 10097.96s]  another appearance is that being told by the booth at dump truck Danny a dump
[10097.96s -> 10101.20s]  truck Danny sighting you heard that right folks
[10101.20s -> 10109.06s]  dump truck Danny is in the house doesn't get any better than this all tied late
[10109.06s -> 10112.82s]  innings little flair shout out to right field hopping off the basu ball little
[10112.82s -> 10117.14s]  late break on it as he was trying to keep his balance before it got to him
[10117.14s -> 10122.14s]  one run comes home the magicians are back on top throw in the third base
[10122.14s -> 10129.70s]  there is no throw as they mishandled it how about that Maryland back on top
[10129.70s -> 10135.94s]  dump truck Danny getting a little spark for the magicians as they retake the
[10135.94s -> 10141.92s]  lead here in the top half of the seventh inning to be the bottom you know that
[10141.96s -> 10150.64s]  puts Fred circus on the hook now in this game circus comes into this game two
[10150.64s -> 10158.06s]  wins no losses but he has picked up two tie decisions on the year yeah a rare
[10158.06s -> 10165.26s]  occasion you'll see a tie in this game but it happens this this is don't adjust
[10165.26s -> 10168.74s]  your screen it's not reloading your twitch feed is not reloading that was
[10168.78s -> 10183.45s]  a strategy from the circus pitcher Fred outside two and one a swarm of beases
[10183.45s -> 10188.82s]  around the field I get a look at it now it's just the that drone we saw earlier
[10188.82s -> 10194.21s]  just been getting shots from above the park and base hit up the middle infield
[10194.21s -> 10199.37s]  pulled in with one out in the runner at third leaves a wide open hole up the
[10199.37s -> 10206.51s]  middle for Donald strange and he exploits it 13 to 12 Maryland on top of
[10206.51s -> 10213.43s]  California a good piece of hitting there help back up still going at it in the
[10213.43s -> 10217.39s]  locker room or the mascots look like another it's in a circle race fighting
[10217.39s -> 10223.71s]  it stopped over the chair over the training table a move just wearing them
[10223.71s -> 10231.27s]  out that is well done so that fight continues to twist and turn we'll keep
[10231.27s -> 10235.55s]  you updated what's going on down in the dugout talk about a royal rumble that
[10235.55s -> 10239.03s]  thing has been going on for quite some time and you know it's it's one of those
[10239.03s -> 10243.99s]  two when these two teams get together to watch those two mascots not only it's
[10243.99s -> 10248.35s]  all part of it you know the reason why these teams are one of the best in the
[10248.35s -> 10252.63s]  league is because of those mascots they have done their fair share of just
[10252.63s -> 10256.47s]  molly whopping opposing mascots all year long great matchup and the
[10256.47s -> 10259.63s]  streaker has made another appearance streaker's back oh look at him he's
[10259.63s -> 10264.63s]  haunting oh my goodness he's pulling those he's pulling Twix right out of his
[10264.63s -> 10270.67s]  package and chucking them at the security guard oh my goodness that's
[10270.67s -> 10275.51s]  even better ground ball to second base meanwhile the streaker backpedaling in
[10275.51s -> 10280.55s]  left field as the out is recorded for the second of the inning dump truck
[10280.55s -> 10285.67s]  Danny reading havoc out there I think this is just gonna have to happen as
[10285.67s -> 10289.79s]  the players continue to play here and dump truck Danny out left field still
[10289.79s -> 10295.27s]  having a good time I mean he is just baiting security out there look at this
[10295.27s -> 10306.11s]  free him three free dump truck Danny the fans have made their voices heard look
[10306.11s -> 10309.19s]  at this Albertson wants him off this field but I don't think it's gonna
[10309.19s -> 10314.47s]  happen a fans Lee all-star I mean you you just cannot say enough about this
[10314.47s -> 10319.19s]  guy that page has got to be just on fire tonight it's reminds me with this golden
[10319.19s -> 10321.91s]  thong if you remember a great baseball hitter in the major league baseball
[10321.91s -> 10327.71s]  named by Jason Giambi and whenever he would get into a slump or a teammate
[10327.71s -> 10332.35s]  would get into a slump they put on a golden underwear golden thong that's
[10332.35s -> 10336.67s]  very much like what dump truck Danny's wearing out there right now blast into
[10336.67s -> 10342.27s]  deep left field unicycling towards it he can't make it in time it one hops the
[10342.27s -> 10346.71s]  wall and the magicians have tacked on a third in this inning he turns on the
[10346.71s -> 10352.73s]  Jets thinking three and Martin majestic coming off the bench with a pinch hit
[10352.73s -> 10357.23s]  RBI triple what a majestic slide into third base we'll get another look at
[10357.23s -> 10362.03s]  this is roped into left field the streaker right now paying dividends for
[10362.03s -> 10366.43s]  the magicians as it really has the circus caught off guard here and it has
[10366.43s -> 10371.59s]  to be it really has to do with that golden underwear that's just flailing
[10371.59s -> 10378.63s]  around right off the fans Lee side and it's another hit by pitch this time
[10378.63s -> 10382.95s]  getting hit Albertson just beside itself can't believe it that another pitcher
[10382.95s -> 10388.43s]  would hit a batter here he's awarding for space now takes a look over into the
[10388.43s -> 10393.03s]  circus dugout you've been flushman and you know what he's probably gonna have a
[10393.03s -> 10397.59s]  sore ass tomorrow too yeah yeah we lost our asses out there between drunk drunk
[10397.59s -> 10401.95s]  dump truck Danny and these players getting rear-ended in the ass these
[10401.95s -> 10409.94s]  pitches this is escalating rather quickly and golden underwear guys
[10409.94s -> 10415.36s]  wearing it in the rear end coach Hanson went over to talk about why how come
[10415.36s -> 10419.20s]  nobody has been thrown out yet especially with all the umpteenth time
[10419.20s -> 10422.12s]  that these teams have been warned about hitting somebody and I believe the
[10422.12s -> 10425.60s]  response was they have no other players they can't throw anybody else out
[10425.60s -> 10443.99s]  Albertson once talked to the shortstop once to make sure everyone's on the same
[10443.99s -> 10454.12s]  page he's threatening to throw out again Harry helium Albertson doesn't want to
[10454.12s -> 10463.25s]  talk back it's an ump show now nice things to say all game long what's
[10463.25s -> 10475.29s]  going on back here oh they're they're wanting to know about the mascot fight
[10475.29s -> 10479.37s]  we've been showing you highlights throughout it's a royal rumble I'm not
[10479.37s -> 10483.95s]  quite sure which locker room but the Dumbledore mascot and the Dopey the
[10483.95s -> 10494.27s]  clown I've been going at it and Albertson is back again Dopey Oh to the
[10494.27s -> 10500.56s]  face oh my goodness I think if whoever wins this battle gets a run tacked on
[10500.56s -> 10510.12s]  to their trying to steal home they get them oh my goodness utter craziness
[10510.12s -> 10517.08s]  happening on both fronts oh my gosh look at this out with an argument here comes
[10517.08s -> 10522.40s]  joy handsome again he is so handsome he can't help but argue with a huge smile I
[10522.40s -> 10526.52s]  don't believe what I just saw in the locker room and on the field a steal of
[10526.52s -> 10532.00s]  home plate you don't see it too often what a play and good work by the circus
[10532.00s -> 10539.92s]  mascot here we go Dumbledore could be out that's a run that is a run for the circus so attack one
[10539.92s -> 10544.50s]  we'll talk to the score where people tack one on for the circus and that is
[10544.50s -> 10658.06s]  pulled back within two we'll be right back on JBA welcome back to car shield
[10658.06s -> 10664.42s]  field as you see germination out in droves here to take in this contest
[10664.42s -> 10668.62s]  between the Maryland magicians and the California circus that big nine run
[10668.62s -> 10673.10s]  inning in the fifth momentarily put the circus on top but the magicians have
[10673.10s -> 10679.26s]  answered back a back-and-forth grinder of a game and the pin gets California
[10679.26s -> 10683.74s]  another run so they're back within two after that mascot duel down in the
[10683.74s -> 10690.94s]  dugout yeah the battle of mascots the win goes to the circus so and now we've
[10690.94s -> 10694.62s]  got the streaker in a yoga session right now with some of the players getting
[10694.62s -> 10698.46s]  them stretched out this is the seventh inning stretch so it completely makes
[10698.46s -> 10704.14s]  sense that dump truck Danny would lead the some of the squad members in some
[10704.14s -> 10711.06s]  Pilates type yoga and you don't get a dump truck like Danny has for no reason
[10711.06s -> 10716.30s]  he is taking the clowns through his routine and look out for some of these
[10716.30s -> 10721.50s]  circus members on fans Lee after the game they will have certainly learned a
[10721.50s -> 10726.58s]  thing or two from dump truck and dump truck one of the finer instructors in
[10726.62s -> 10738.22s]  the country and you got to look out to you know I understand that that our crew
[10738.22s -> 10741.98s]  chief Elbertson might not be appreciating this but you never know how
[10741.98s -> 10747.30s]  many extra hot dogs are our guide dump truck Danny has hidden down in that
[10747.30s -> 10752.62s]  package yeah there's a look like too many maybe one medium-sized one but
[10752.62s -> 10756.94s]  we'll see you never quite know it hasn't been fully cooked yet still that's that's
[10757.38s -> 10761.26s]  made no one wants to know how the hot dogs made this one eat it you know the
[10761.26s -> 10767.22s]  raw dog does have a different volume you know it's we won't get into it it's it's
[10767.22s -> 10773.94s]  the Maryland magicians of 14 to 12 over the California circus we're trying to
[10773.94s -> 10779.56s]  play ball here so we don't have enough players for California I don't know the
[10779.56s -> 10784.10s]  rulebook but you were talking about get the magicians led right now send
[10784.10s -> 10789.18s]  somebody on loan as they do in European soccer loan a player to the circus see
[10789.18s -> 10796.46s]  what happens here kind of this is a tough situation I'm not sure what the
[10796.46s -> 10804.42s]  solution and Elbertson has a bat in his hands right now no no umpires about to
[10804.42s -> 10813.82s]  enter this game for California okay this is you know we've seen over the course of
[10813.82s -> 10820.10s]  this year but this is this might be a step far look at this now this is this
[10820.10s -> 10823.66s]  is true dedication to the league you know they don't have enough players he
[10823.66s -> 10828.90s]  says the show must go on I'm digging up some stats you know the JBA does a good
[10828.90s -> 10833.06s]  job of keeping random stats this is actually Elbertson's third at bat in his
[10833.06s -> 10837.10s]  career as an umpire so not unheard of that he's done this before he's over to
[10837.10s -> 10841.18s]  in his career let's see what he gets his first hit he bats from the right side
[10841.18s -> 10845.26s]  slightly open stance first pitch tried to frame it up and he calls it high
[10845.26s -> 10849.62s]  calls it you know that looked to be just underneath the letters for a call
[10849.62s -> 10856.26s]  striking Elbertson hey surprise surprise it's ball one ball one of course as
[10856.26s -> 10866.65s]  Albert to in the player at bat pinch hitting for the circus you know he
[10866.65s -> 10872.33s]  called another ball Elbertson may only have three at bats as an umpire but
[10872.33s -> 10878.97s]  he's hitting 238 so as good as the stats that they keep here for for the JBA the
[10878.97s -> 10882.41s]  math may be a little bit off look at this he's pulled it down the line it's
[10882.41s -> 10888.41s]  fair Albertson speeding past first he's thinking to throw comes in the second
[10888.41s -> 10894.05s]  oh he takes a quick turnaround in a good decision by crew chief Albertson he
[10894.05s -> 10898.37s]  rules himself safe at first now you gotta wonder if he's gonna call ball
[10898.41s -> 10902.69s]  strikes in the first base but a trickler down the left side found an open hole
[10902.69s -> 10908.17s]  pass the diving third baseman and into the outfield thankfully the left dealer
[10908.17s -> 10917.95s]  good you can see the wheels there good stop and track back there not sure if
[10917.95s -> 10921.79s]  he knows what to do with his hands quite when he's right I love the technique
[10921.79s -> 10925.87s]  it's like he's getting mad at the air he's karate chopping the air as he goes
[10925.87s -> 10930.55s]  around and it just fires you up so the up is on first base and he's calling
[10930.55s -> 10935.31s]  balls and strikes in there well he has a little bit better view from over there
[10935.31s -> 10938.79s]  is something that he told me I actually caught up with crew chief Albertson
[10938.79s -> 10942.75s]  before this game and you know I raised that question as we get another look at
[10942.75s -> 10947.43s]  dump truck Danny he's hanging out with with joy handsome and wonder if Joy's
[10947.43s -> 10952.15s]  rubbing off on him a little bit that'll up that that fans Lee page content even
[10952.15s -> 10957.07s]  more I gotta tell you dumpster Danny's double-dipping he's going he's seducing
[10957.07s -> 10963.07s]  the circus bench with hot yoga and now he's over in the magicians bench there
[10963.07s -> 10967.19s]  you see right there in the dugout there's dump truck Danny well you know
[10967.19s -> 10973.47s]  the ball found the ball players have been known to not be able to turn down a
[10973.47s -> 10977.79s]  dump truck easily and when a guy like Danny walks into your life it's just
[10977.79s -> 10983.19s]  hard to say no it's hard to say no and you know and he's doing it for a good
[10983.19s -> 10992.06s]  cause we got to free the ball handler outside bring one count here and not
[10992.06s -> 10997.14s]  only that fondling abilities really translates well to this game and we'll
[10997.14s -> 11001.86s]  see if you know he can give a few fondling lessons down in the dugout yeah
[11001.86s -> 11007.18s]  you really want to you know make sure to tickle it just a little bit look at it
[11007.18s -> 11012.34s]  look at the showboating down to second base and you know Albertson he wouldn't
[11012.34s -> 11015.94s]  have none of this from one of the players in the game yet here he goes
[11015.94s -> 11022.22s]  himself showboating on a walk down to second base I mean come on come on yeah
[11022.22s -> 11026.86s]  that's not something Albertson tolerates when he's behind the plate but now that
[11026.86s -> 11031.46s]  he's thrust into a position player role he has to play both roles now has to
[11031.46s -> 11036.70s]  play umpire crew chief and try score a run here for the California circus yeah
[11036.70s -> 11039.94s]  that may get lost in all of this we got a two run ballgame in the bottom of the
[11039.94s -> 11044.94s]  seventh inning these are crunch crunch time moments and don't forget to tune
[11044.94s -> 11048.66s]  into crunch time after this game that's our postgame show we'll get you updates
[11048.66s -> 11052.58s]  from other scores around the league and highlights and maybe even unpack a
[11052.58s -> 11056.54s]  little bit more of some of the craziness that's going on in this one yeah plenty
[11056.54s -> 11060.78s]  games around the league here tonight well I've crunched on the postgame it's
[11060.78s -> 11065.90s]  Tom chair but it's Dickie direct well have your highlights from all across the
[11065.94s -> 11072.14s]  league here in the JBA Victor vanish with the pitch to Percy polka dot and the
[11072.14s -> 11077.54s]  calls being made from second base Oh dump truck Danny get another look at
[11077.54s -> 11080.98s]  that scoreboard real quick see he's double-dipping he's going in between
[11080.98s -> 11085.38s]  benches given the each bench a little taste of the dump truck and you notice
[11085.38s -> 11090.94s]  how there is just zero protest from either dugout they are with wide open
[11090.94s -> 11096.50s]  arms welcoming him as we get called third strike caught off of second base
[11096.50s -> 11103.14s]  uh-oh problems in a run down oh he's gonna try to take third he's still
[11103.14s -> 11106.02s]  caught in the pickle he's headed back the other way he's chopping air
[11106.02s -> 11112.54s]  furiously great drop drop drop drop oh wait a second is there another ball out
[11112.54s -> 11115.54s]  there does Albertson know that he's out or safe let's see what he's gonna call
[11115.54s -> 11124.25s]  here he's been tagged out twice by two separate balls safe oh my goodness have
[11124.25s -> 11135.02s]  another look at this fans Lee brings you it oh you'll slide a hand but you would
[11135.02s -> 11139.30s]  expect nothing less from the magicians right back into his pocket unbeknownst
[11139.30s -> 11144.84s]  to Albertson and that's the kind of stuff that have made the Maryland
[11144.84s -> 11149.52s]  magicians a winning ball club year in and year out yeah and you got to wonder
[11149.52s -> 11153.00s]  if somebody other general managers managers are on the league and they see
[11153.00s -> 11157.52s]  Albertson playing such an impactful role right now maybe he'll get a call up and
[11157.52s -> 11161.56s]  this is a really big moment in this game we've seen some of the power cards that
[11161.56s -> 11165.60s]  have been played that have made a really big impact on this game and now with
[11165.60s -> 11171.72s]  Albertson running on the base pass for California down by two there's got to be
[11171.72s -> 11175.20s]  a lot of strategy being discussed there on the mound and we're seeing it right
[11175.20s -> 11182.12s]  now a new new elixir has been brewed by the magicians has been given to their
[11182.12s -> 11186.48s]  keeper or excuse me their pitcher they're pulling rabbits out of hats
[11186.48s -> 11191.44s]  elixirs out of bottles well you know and this is why I defer to the future Hall
[11191.44s -> 11196.12s]  of Famer Gary Grunt I wrote brought up the question earlier in this game is
[11196.12s -> 11199.96s]  that elixir going to be a detriment to this magicians team you said no no no
[11199.96s -> 11203.08s]  this is this is something that this team needs to be consistent with
[11203.08s -> 11205.92s]  throughout the game and we're starting to see that here now in the late in yeah
[11205.92s -> 11210.96s]  we used to live it by this and for the old cavemen you know the more elixir the
[11210.96s -> 11216.04s]  better oh finish just pulled another trick it's still in his hand oh the
[11216.04s -> 11223.84s]  tech comes from behind Albertson tagged out he didn't even know oh boy he
[11223.84s -> 11228.72s]  recognizes now there's two balls in play Albertson is privy to what's going on
[11228.72s -> 11233.15s]  here how does it turn out look at this the old two balls
[11233.15s -> 11247.14s]  oh same two balls change the drawers if there's anyone who understands that it
[11247.14s -> 11251.38s]  should be joy handsome after hanging out with dump truck Danny just seconds ago
[11251.38s -> 11254.06s]  I don't know if he's just telling everyone he has two balls or there was
[11254.06s -> 11260.27s]  actually two balls on the field either way you think that he would have to
[11260.27s -> 11271.08s]  understand and Albertson has made this a one run ballgame 1413 two ball track
[11271.08s -> 11277.40s]  others stricker and that is a dump truck if I have ever seen one my goodness
[11277.40s -> 11281.04s]  pretty flat though if you ask me I don't know nothing really happened it back
[11281.04s -> 11286.56s]  there you must see must have a dump truck must have come from a different
[11286.56s -> 11293.32s]  nickname if you know what I mean well you know Danny he's he's seen his career
[11293.32s -> 11298.36s]  really change over the years he's he used to have that huge badonkadon
[11298.36s -> 11302.48s]  now he's got to get it done in different ways should call him no ass
[11302.48s -> 11309.88s]  well we know ask Danny security thinking look this is my chance look at look at
[11309.88s -> 11315.44s]  Danny just haunting him yeah bring it on the dump truck says look I got a look at
[11315.44s -> 11321.44s]  that jiggle jiggle you know what his money don't jiggle jiggle it folds makes
[11321.44s -> 11328.96s]  you wiggle wiggle riding in his fiat oh my goodness thought this security
[11328.96s -> 11335.40s]  chasing him all game long in dump truck gets the piggy the piggyback ride he's
[11335.40s -> 11340.04s]  on the loose again you can't stop this he's just glowing right now with just a
[11340.04s -> 11345.40s]  sexy sweat Xavier McMagic has moved to the mound and in the blink of an eye he
[11345.40s -> 11350.32s]  has delivered ball one low some serious heat coming from the right-hander and
[11350.32s -> 11354.72s]  dump truck starting to look a little bit worn out now that stamina starting to
[11354.72s -> 11360.36s]  take a hit and certainly get a little buggy the dew point is high here in the
[11360.36s -> 11369.83s]  in the area right now is Xavier McMagic on the rubber now for the magicians two
[11369.83s -> 11374.03s]  point three one ERA three wins and one loss for the six foot two two and her
[11374.03s -> 11378.31s]  five-pound right-hander saw McMagic make some great plays in the field and
[11378.31s -> 11381.59s]  certainly that stamina is running down Danny dump truck a guy that's been known
[11381.59s -> 11385.63s]  to go all night long earlier in his career again that that career arc just
[11385.63s -> 11389.75s]  changing and progressing you have to learn to get it done in different ways
[11389.75s -> 11395.95s]  you know he used to be able to just make it happen any amount of physical force
[11395.95s -> 11399.59s]  needed all night long he could get it done he's got to do it in more subtle
[11399.59s -> 11402.83s]  ways now I can't tell if the security guards trying to play defense for the
[11402.83s -> 11406.43s]  magicians or he's just trying to work his way over to dump truck Danny and
[11406.43s -> 11410.51s]  he's on the move once again yeah Danny was not gonna be fooled by that security
[11410.51s -> 11417.43s]  guard not quite fleet of foot so back into the magicians dugout goes dump
[11417.43s -> 11421.59s]  truck and we had a strikeout meanwhile so two outs in the inning runner advances
[11421.59s -> 11430.44s]  to second base on that steel high chopper McMagic there hands it and oh my
[11430.48s -> 11435.00s]  goodness what would you consider that to be about feet to play the game oh my
[11435.00s -> 11440.04s]  gosh it's up there no doubt about it between that and when the circus catcher
[11440.04s -> 11443.36s]  ran over into the netting to get that foul ball but that's a great play right
[11443.36s -> 11449.96s]  we love that play by hunter sweets as well that'll do it here for the seventh
[11449.96s -> 11453.84s]  inning when we come back we've got the eighth coming your way you're watching
[11454.08s -> 11597.24s]  the German Baseball Association right here on Twitch we've got a one-run ball
[11597.24s -> 11602.60s]  game here at car shield field as we come to play here in the eighth inning fans
[11602.60s -> 11607.76s]  in the ocean of online content there's a lot of websites and little crabs that
[11607.76s -> 11611.56s]  can take your info without you even knowing it but you can swim under their
[11611.56s -> 11617.28s]  radar using surf shark VPN and oh my goodness you're gonna want to keep a
[11617.28s -> 11621.52s]  whole lot of stuff safe we got a fire show of sorts going on out here what is
[11621.52s -> 11627.58s]  this this this cannot this cannot be safe drones heading over there try to
[11627.58s -> 11634.26s]  get a fire off here he is fire breathing we talked about fire breathing dragons
[11634.26s -> 11645.22s]  we've got fire breathing circus it's a firefight oh my goodness and Albertson
[11645.22s -> 11647.50s]  just trying to get the batter up here magicians trying to figure out who
[11647.50s -> 11652.86s]  they're trying to send to the plate but look at this danger danger Will Robinson
[11653.42s -> 11667.28s]  oh my goodness whoa I've always wondered what they've you know put in their mouth
[11667.28s -> 11672.12s]  to you and obviously it's not gasoline is it or are they drinking gasoline and
[11672.12s -> 11675.84s]  then blowing it into his mouth I'd love to know what he's drinking and then
[11675.84s -> 11679.48s]  spitting to make that happen it's got to be ever clear and look at that right
[11679.48s -> 11686.96s]  some type of really hard-licking moonshine meanwhile dropping the bat
[11686.96s -> 11691.80s]  down on this one on high deep fly ball in a right field but Craig mystery has
[11691.80s -> 11697.36s]  put away with the fly out for the first out of the top of the eighth looks like
[11697.36s -> 11705.74s]  it's just water I didn't know water did that now you do water maybe that's the
[11705.74s -> 11711.46s]  elixir of life the magicians and as a don't try this at home kids you have to
[11711.46s -> 11716.22s]  appreciate another way for you to light that fire yeah a car being played here
[11716.90s -> 11722.70s]  it's the playing tag there are no force outs for this half inning so all outs
[11722.70s -> 11726.58s]  have to come via the tag and going to go back to the cavemen creating fire
[11726.58s -> 11730.50s]  absolutely was going through some cold nights on the road for the caveman and
[11730.50s -> 11735.36s]  we certainly could have used a fire starter like that on our squad for back
[11735.36s -> 11739.74s]  of the day maybe explain to the fans right now for those that don't quite
[11739.74s -> 11744.74s]  understand how difficult it is to leave your hut where you're used to being
[11744.78s -> 11748.90s]  where you're comfortable to have to go on the road and learn how you're going
[11748.90s -> 11751.82s]  to find a source of fire all these different things that cavemen have to
[11751.82s -> 11755.70s]  worry about well it's not for everyone and only the finest caveman can really
[11755.70s -> 11759.98s]  escape the cave so there's a couple of tests you have to take you know you have
[11759.98s -> 11764.46s]  to count to ten can you do your ABCDs can you sing twinkle twinkle little star
[11764.46s -> 11769.98s]  so there's a couple of things that you have to to get done before you can leave
[11769.98s -> 11775.78s]  the cave and I was fortunate enough to be blessed with just an undenying ability
[11775.78s -> 11779.82s]  to club the baseball as well as have a couple of smarts in my brain as well
[11779.82s -> 11784.86s]  the voice of Gary grunt future Hall of Famer as we had a scorched single the
[11784.86s -> 11792.94s]  second hit of the ball game for Ronnie Smith and look at this we got another
[11792.94s -> 11799.58s]  card being played this time by the circus oh beach balls and life's the
[11799.58s -> 11803.02s]  beach and we're gonna break them out so the opposing pitcher must use a beach
[11803.02s -> 11807.90s]  ball for this next how about this strategy only tagouts go to the beach
[11807.90s -> 11815.02s]  ball yeah brilliant move now we just need the beach ball so I don't know if
[11815.02s -> 11820.47s]  someone has a blown up how it comes out the magicians dug out oh how convenient
[11820.47s -> 11832.27s]  coach handsome bringing the ball out oh taunting you know joy he's no he's done
[11832.27s -> 11838.35s]  a nice job though pushing the line not getting too far on Elbertson's bad side
[11838.35s -> 11844.51s]  as we saw the circus just took it over the top in those middle innings
[11844.51s -> 11849.22s]  look at this defensive alignment yep they're thinking this is gonna be an
[11849.22s -> 11855.06s]  easy out the amoeba defense a knuckleball didn't quite make it to the
[11855.06s -> 11864.40s]  play pitch and it's a 30-footer oh no say just inside they call it a ball it's
[11864.40s -> 11867.92s]  a ball yeah it's so important with this beach ball you got to get the right
[11867.92s -> 11871.72s]  spin if there's any kind of slider or downward action on it you see you see
[11871.72s -> 11874.36s]  there he's not getting the proper backspin that's never gonna make it the
[11874.36s -> 11879.12s]  home plate can't get over the top of the ball right now and runner on third as
[11879.12s -> 11884.48s]  again all circus position players are in the infield at Fred circus he's
[11884.48s -> 11887.96s]  sitting at a three four five ERA but this beach ball is threatening to balloon
[11887.96s -> 11895.85s]  his ERA dump truck doesn't like it oh Danny's trying to get involved oh he
[11895.85s -> 11900.73s]  can't get it oh look at this Elbertson put a hand on him I think Elbertson just wanted to
[11900.73s -> 11906.05s]  get a hold of the dump truck Elbertson grasping for that dump truck as hard as
[11906.05s -> 11911.14s]  he can yeah I can't grab those dump trucks too sweaty right now too misty
[11911.14s -> 11916.10s]  elusive you got to watch out the the swamp ass factor is a big thing in these
[11916.10s -> 11920.10s]  kind of situations you grab anywhere around the waist it's gonna be tough to
[11920.10s -> 11925.14s]  corral let's just be thankful that the umpire Elbertson did get any of the
[11925.14s -> 11928.54s]  waste action because we could have seen a lot more than a golden thong oh my
[11928.54s -> 11937.62s]  goodness they're coming home with it he tags him out oh my goodness what a half
[11937.62s -> 11943.94s]  fitting the power cards being played it does not matter the California circus
[11943.94s -> 11950.06s]  are still alive going to the bottom of the eighth it's a one run ball game you
[11950.06s -> 11955.22s]  will not want to miss it what a play have another look as we go to break
[11955.22s -> 12087.02s]  that's up Chuck with the play we'll be right back after this on twitch and how
[12087.02s -> 12091.70s]  about that you make an amazing play in the field and right after that Manny up
[12091.70s -> 12096.66s]  Chuck 69 to the plate 69 ha ha ha we did a lot of that in my play in David the
[12096.66s -> 12103.36s]  caveman certainly no doubt about it and now the magicians have just been teepee
[12103.36s -> 12108.36s]  absolutely teepee to hell is that the new version of a being rick rolled
[12109.12s -> 12114.50s]  they've been they've been rolled there's no doubt about that up Chuck watches it
[12114.50s -> 12121.50s]  sail over his head there's a lot going on in tonight's game and you know that's
[12121.50s -> 12125.08s]  that's all part of it it's it's the level of focus that you bring in the
[12125.08s -> 12129.38s]  late innings in a game like this one run ball game toilet paper being thrown
[12129.38s -> 12133.34s]  people are getting pied in the face straight now a 90 mile an hour fastball
[12133.34s -> 12138.62s]  right at the knees just all in one games play here at the JBA by the way this is
[12138.62s -> 12145.70s]  jack port on the mount 8.76 ERA for the season as up Chuck tips it into the mid
[12145.70s -> 12151.78s]  69 not the correct number right now no not at all as you see ports numbers
[12151.78s -> 12156.78s]  their opponent average of 168 is whip at 110 that's exactly where you want your
[12156.78s -> 12162.18s]  numbers to be a successful to be if you want to be a successful pitcher up check
[12162.38s -> 12165.70s]  take strike three hates the outside corner
[12165.70s -> 12170.58s]  guys swing the bat you can't if you're if you're gonna wear a number 69 you
[12170.58s -> 12175.86s]  can't just go down without a swing no look you're gonna wear number 69 you
[12175.86s -> 12180.94s]  gotta have the cojones the big marbles to be able to swing the bat
[12180.94s -> 12188.36s]  speaking of big marbles he's loose again dump truck Danny I mean this guy you
[12188.36s -> 12191.48s]  almost feel bad for the security guard trying to keep this well you know what
[12191.68s -> 12196.52s]  I feel bad for dump truck Danny that I was dogging his stamina earlier in this
[12196.52s -> 12202.51s]  game look at this dude go he does hot yoga so he's got the stamina and people
[12202.51s -> 12206.83s]  don't realize just how sweaty you get when you do hot yoga dump truck Danny
[12206.83s -> 12212.79s]  has those pores just permanently open as this is booted it short and that will
[12212.79s -> 12222.24s]  allow him at first base to reach that's hairy helium dump truck Danny back at
[12222.24s -> 12232.38s]  it again look at this guy security guy just no chance for this look oh my that
[12232.38s -> 12237.02s]  is a beautiful job and you know what Gary you have to appreciate that yeah oh
[12237.02s -> 12242.34s]  here we go right right through into the cave there he goes and dump truck is
[12242.34s -> 12250.72s]  gone oh I see it's like a looney tunes Warner Brothers thing yeah you can't go
[12250.72s -> 12258.00s]  in sorry access D9 sorry that's only dump truck Danny's oh my look at this
[12258.00s -> 12264.44s]  that's dump truck Danny's territory no entering that cave I mean if bugs had
[12264.44s -> 12275.98s]  just a golden speedo it's dump truck Danny the golden speedo of love the
[12275.98s -> 12284.77s]  pitch comes in high sweaty nasty smelly love and let's not forget the role that
[12285.01s -> 12289.45s]  crew chief Albertson played in this game to keep this within reach for
[12289.45s -> 12293.01s]  California he was huge coming in when they didn't have enough players to play
[12293.01s -> 12296.65s]  this one's popped into foul territory third baseman going back on it and he
[12296.65s -> 12301.83s]  makes the play down to his knees well done and the Maryland Magicians now have
[12301.83s -> 12304.93s]  two outs in the inning here in the top of the earth see me the bottom of the
[12304.93s -> 12308.41s]  eighth inning mystery doesn't spend a lot of time on his knees but does a
[12308.41s -> 12313.47s]  great job here dump truck Danny knows a thing or two about that and he would
[12313.47s -> 12324.82s]  approve two outs runner at first base is Harry helium and now Paul Laffington
[12324.82s -> 12329.54s]  grounded out his last time up he's 0 for 2 that pitch gets away and helium into
[12329.54s -> 12335.24s]  scoring position now with two downs the game the game's potential tying run at
[12335.24s -> 12339.16s]  second base you get a look at that scoreboard it is 16 hits for the
[12339.16s -> 12346.94s]  Magicians as high as we get as high as we get it's 15 so as soon as we get to 16
[12346.94s -> 12350.86s]  they turned it upside down so I wonder if they get 17 hits is it the upside
[12350.86s -> 12354.50s]  down 14 they go the other way do they go back down and just put the numbers
[12354.50s -> 12359.14s]  upside down Harry we haven't seen this many runs scored in quite some time or this
[12359.14s -> 12364.34s]  many hits at least I mean this league is known for low scoring and really good
[12364.34s -> 12368.34s]  pitching but tonight that that storyline has been flown out the window you see
[12368.34s -> 12374.66s]  it with the point seven six ERA from Jack Port as he delivers a nasty one
[12374.66s -> 12379.62s]  underneath the hands of Laffington all he could do was foul it away and try to
[12379.62s -> 12386.30s]  live for another one into his account here it's something else that's that's
[12386.30s -> 12392.02s]  really important I think as a ballplayer you see that quick grab between the legs
[12392.02s -> 12396.98s]  in between pitches adjust your nuts adjust your swing that that's typically
[12396.98s -> 12402.22s]  the approach yeah pretty much you know you want to get comfortable and sometimes
[12402.22s -> 12407.18s]  you got long balls up there you got to keep it short I got to keep the wide
[12407.30s -> 12414.46s]  stance of the hang and you're just looking to make contact contact is the
[12414.46s -> 12422.62s]  key all the pickoff moving they got him in second base what a play the magicians
[12422.62s -> 12429.42s]  pulling out of their sleeve to get out of the inning fans this inning is brought
[12429.42s -> 12433.70s]  to you by fans Lee a spicy social network be sure to check out the link

[12437.86s -> 12441.38s]  creators back for more after this this is the J.B.A.
[12539.75s -> 12546.47s]  we have entered the final and ninth inning of a wild 14 13 ball game even
[12546.67s -> 12552.31s]  Elbertson starting to run a little bit short fused out here yeah there's been a
[12552.31s -> 12556.67s]  lot of antics which we are known to see here the J.B.A. sometimes they can get a
[12556.67s -> 12561.55s]  little too wacky and you know every man has its limit and Elbertson you know it
[12561.55s -> 12567.55s]  may have been reached right now you know I gotta say for a one-man crew chief on
[12567.55s -> 12571.63s]  an artificial field this is the cleanest home plate I have ever seen kept he's
[12571.63s -> 12575.99s]  done a nice job clean keeping the home plate clean you know you think that his
[12575.99s -> 12581.35s]  wife appreciates the cleanliness when he gets back home to the sugar mama
[12581.35s -> 12586.51s]  tonight salmon trying to bunt his way aboard to lead off this top of the
[12586.51s -> 12591.47s]  ninth but to no avail and Elbertson has injured himself and whoever he has to
[12591.47s -> 12597.07s]  come in for next will probably not want that injured Elbertson on their squat
[12597.07s -> 12600.79s]  shaking it off in the left hand I don't think we have an ambulance on site here
[12600.79s -> 12605.23s]  so you may have to make that call should it get any worse for Elbertson
[12605.23s -> 12609.91s]  this is Fred circus on the mound delivering inside one and one the count
[12609.91s -> 12614.07s]  fans another reminder that after this game we have got coverage from around
[12614.07s -> 12619.17s]  the league for you it's crunch time it'll be Tom Chairman joined by Dickie
[12619.17s -> 12624.15s]  Drek coming your way right after this one and that Mike salmon is contesting
[12624.15s -> 12627.83s]  that that one hit him in the arm now as he is acting as if it hit him in the arm
[12627.83s -> 12630.55s]  I thought it caught a little bit of his jersey but didn't catch him in the arm I
[12630.55s -> 12634.51s]  didn't think he saw that he sold it salmon has sold it we'll get a replay of
[12634.51s -> 12639.87s]  it here and Elbertson buying it look at it it definitely came inside right in
[12639.87s -> 12643.87s]  that armpit area and it may have caught him in the arm hit the left arm look
[12643.87s -> 12649.55s]  like you hit the back of his right arm so first base has been awarded ball
[12649.55s -> 12656.19s]  clown back on the field it's black up more balls for Elbertson you know that
[12656.19s -> 12659.67s]  was a little bit of a cheap shot from Elbertson I mean this guy has been
[12659.67s -> 12663.91s]  helping him out retrieving balls all game long and rewards him with a swift
[12663.91s -> 12669.15s]  kick to the nuts like I said every man has its limits and right now I think
[12669.15s -> 12680.62s]  Elbertson has reached his now he's going over to talk to the fans leadoff man has
[12680.62s -> 12687.94s]  reached in this inning and Mike salmon it's now Donald strange at the plate
[12687.94s -> 12697.45s]  here in the ninth inning and this one is driven in the left field going back on
[12697.45s -> 12703.25s]  it the catch is made for the first out of the unit good wood there just not
[12703.25s -> 12706.89s]  enough height underneath that ball to get over the left fielder's head and a
[12706.89s -> 12712.77s]  good play out and left field routine play for the left fielder here about ten
[12712.77s -> 12723.68s]  steps back position make that snag good play and there is the victorious
[12723.72s -> 12728.88s]  mascot oh yeah took it to Dumbledore earlier now he's enjoying the fruits of
[12728.88s -> 12737.13s]  his victory trying to distract his own picture apparently it's working after
[12737.13s -> 12744.67s]  a ball look oh that's maybe he's just giving crew chief Elbertson exactly
[12744.67s -> 12757.18s]  what he needs here well contact oh oh oh oh Dumbledore wants revenge oh my
[12757.18s -> 12766.86s]  goodness oh yeah that that turned rather quickly yeah this is supposed to be
[12766.86s -> 12773.26s]  family show apologize to the kids out there oh hammered in the ass the mascot
[12773.26s -> 12780.48s]  mascot love it happening here nobody wants to see that on live television
[12780.48s -> 12786.09s]  that's why they go to the internet for that stuff this is technically live
[12786.09s -> 12791.71s]  television on the internet that's the way you do expect it just another day in
[12791.71s -> 12797.72s]  the JBA some some people say backdoor guests are best inside with that bitch
[12797.72s -> 12804.59s]  borderline from Fred circus he removes the hat unhappy with the call here comes
[12804.59s -> 12816.96s]  another one this time it's outside and circus leaning can't believe it it's a
[12816.96s -> 12829.66s]  walk no three and one now big cut in a miss from Xavier make magic big magic
[12829.66s -> 12839.38s]  had the ground rule double back in the fourth inning the payoff is spoiled big
[12839.38s -> 12847.42s]  moments in this game one out runner at second base in a one-run game the
[12847.42s -> 12856.50s]  magicians trying to add insurance here in the top half of the ninth come for
[12856.50s -> 12865.03s]  the baseball stay for the mascot love it or should I say mascot humping that
[12865.03s -> 12869.55s]  one's filed off oh oh that was surely gonna hit the car over there would have
[12869.55s -> 12874.30s]  been a point the insurance claim yeah how did your car windshield break well
[12874.38s -> 12880.78s]  the JBA and pitch got filed off next thing you know if I replace my windshield
[12880.78s -> 12887.22s]  people would understand get a look over there oh the late swing but they call
[12887.22s -> 12892.26s]  ball for Wow they award him first base and look at this Fred circus not even
[12892.26s -> 12896.96s]  contesting that call I have no words for this that hunter sweets is just not up
[12896.96s -> 12905.09s]  in arms here runners on first and second for the
[12905.09s -> 12912.06s]  magicians in front here in the top half of the ninth inning Martin majestic came
[12912.06s -> 12917.70s]  in as a pinch hitter a couple innings ago he comes to the dish once again now
[12917.70s -> 12924.08s]  look at Fred big top he's like look he's one we are approaching a four-hour game
[12924.08s -> 12935.07s]  time here now Roger with us this JBA all-important game here playoff
[12935.11s -> 12940.59s]  complications on the line oh majestic taken by surprise by the pitch but it's
[12940.59s -> 12949.22s]  high ball one the next from circus in for a strike in majestic looking up
[12949.22s -> 12960.96s]  above his head high fly ball in the medium-depth center field towards right
[12960.96s -> 12965.36s]  center the catch is made both runners tag fire towards third base in the pick
[12965.36s -> 12970.80s]  unable to be made it skips over the sidewall out of play and home plate is
[12970.84s -> 12985.03s]  awarded it's a 15-13 magicians lead and that was a nice arm from out in
[12985.03s -> 12989.71s]  centerfield from David Hawk just caught it on the in-between hot yeah not this
[12989.71s -> 12994.55s]  kind of scoops you want to see from a third baseman there short hopped him
[12994.55s -> 13000.59s]  almost like a Roger Dorn he gave you the ole bullshit and you know they they may
[13000.59s -> 13005.71s]  get him some extra work back in the bathroom I know Albertson has certainly
[13005.75s -> 13011.71s]  provided some work for someone and we'll see if it'll be scoops over at third
[13011.71s -> 13016.79s]  base Sean giggles might not be laughing about that one after the game giggling
[13016.79s -> 13022.91s]  after that especially the run scores one and oh the count it's Roy Flushman
[13022.91s -> 13029.39s]  again as he takes up and throw down to second base it is a stolen base late
[13029.39s -> 13033.39s]  throw I believe that was Mitch Mick magic luring that throw kind of stopped
[13033.43s -> 13043.89s]  about three quarters of the way he did the 2-0 pitch pulled on the ground foul
[13043.89s -> 13057.63s]  down the third base side and ball clown to home plates lying fresh set of balls
[13057.63s -> 13070.89s]  gives a tweet of the horn it wasn't a fart that was a tweet long turn in a
[13070.89s -> 13084.45s]  pitch is fouled back out of play to to count here oh quick pitch try to catch
[13084.45s -> 13091.43s]  him off guard play made by the third baseman throw across is away and another
[13091.43s -> 13097.03s]  error on the circus there's gonna have to be some serious poop and scoop and
[13097.03s -> 13100.83s]  going on after this game for the circus oh my goodness he lost the ball doesn't
[13100.83s -> 13104.07s]  know where it is no one knows where it is we're all doing 360s out here
[13104.07s -> 13111.03s]  Albertson oh oh it's a pickle throw it back home he's caught in the rundown
[13111.91s -> 13117.63s]  it's another great play by up Chuck he has been on point defensively in this
[13117.63s -> 13122.83s]  game for the circus yeah a mental mistake there for the magicians opens
[13122.83s -> 13126.75s]  the door up a little bit here for the circus as they had an easy run there
[13126.75s -> 13131.07s]  instead of a three run lead it's now just a two run lead as Aaron base
[13131.07s -> 13134.95s]  running costing costing the magician just when you thought the magicians have
[13134.95s -> 13139.39s]  seen this one a million times they get caught off guard and that'll do it for
[13139.39s -> 13144.23s]  the top half of the night one last chance for the circus when we come back
[13144.23s -> 13329.76s]  you're watching the German Baseball Association on Twitch welcome back
[13329.76s -> 13334.88s]  entering the ninth inning of play we've got a two run ballgame the California
[13334.88s -> 13339.48s]  circus trying to get back into this one against the Maryland magicians I am
[13339.48s -> 13345.12s]  Storm Williamson joined by my partner here Gary grunt the Phoenix caveman
[13345.12s -> 13349.08s]  great we've been treated to some tremendous baseball tonight and you
[13349.08s -> 13352.16s]  would expect a fireworks finish in this one yeah a lot of run score with the
[13352.16s -> 13356.12s]  magicians going into this final half inning with a two run lead circus still
[13356.12s -> 13360.80s]  with a chance it could easily tie this one up we'll see if they can close it
[13360.80s -> 13368.39s]  out Paul at car shield field Paul laughing tin first to the dish he ducks
[13368.39s -> 13378.83s]  out of the way of all one still Jack port on the mound for the Maryland
[13378.83s -> 13394.80s]  magicians it's two and oh to laughing to make it three and oh not what you want
[13394.80s -> 13398.28s]  to see out of your guy in the ninth inning with a two run lead and three
[13398.28s -> 13403.56s]  straight balls your top closer you want him coming in pump and strikes oh my
[13403.56s -> 13414.62s]  gosh jackhammers that one but yanks it well foul three and one laughing tin is
[13414.62s -> 13425.09s]  over to ground it out his last time up in the sixth pops it up behind home
[13425.09s -> 13432.58s]  plate Flushman can't locate it and it'll land foul harmlessly it'll stay alive
[13432.58s -> 13438.52s]  here good work to take that all right yeah Austin lights catcher couldn't find
[13438.52s -> 13461.15s]  it three and to the count now to Paul laughing tin extremely shallow in the
[13461.15s -> 13466.63s]  outfield for laughing tin as he pops it up on the infield pitcher coming in for
[13466.63s -> 13471.39s]  it and makes the grab first out Jack board comes back from three and oh to
[13471.39s -> 13476.91s]  record the first out so the circus down to the last two outs need to find some
[13476.91s -> 13481.55s]  of that magic and steal it from the magicians and get it into their bats oh
[13481.55s -> 13486.87s]  we're gonna have another at bat here from look at this okay oh and we're
[13486.87s -> 13495.59s]  getting a power card played oh the power card 5x being played by the circus
[13496.55s -> 13503.71s]  manager the player at bat is allowed five strikes before they're out not three
[13503.71s -> 13508.71s]  strikes in your out it's five strikes and you're out for this next at bat saved
[13508.71s -> 13512.87s]  it for just the right time yeah near desperation mode you got to create a
[13512.87s -> 13517.23s]  spark and you know might as well give one of your better hitters a better
[13517.23s -> 13526.35s]  chance to put something in play take some packs as well so now Greg shake
[13526.39s -> 13531.83s]  that Laffy Taffy will have a couple extra strikes to work with check that it
[13531.83s -> 13536.39s]  is it's Albertson in the game he threw out the Laffy Taffy unfortunately
[13536.39s -> 13542.53s]  Albert's gonna hit again he's got the five strikes so it was one for one on the
[13542.53s -> 13545.85s]  day you see the umpires got five home runs on the air they could use one of
[13545.85s -> 13559.20s]  those right now to tie this game first pitch to him ties him up in nuts if you
[13559.20s -> 13563.00s]  saw that storm but there was a waft of smoke going home going on behind home
[13563.00s -> 13566.96s]  played don't know if someone's got the wacky weed going out the devil's lettuce
[13566.96s -> 13573.38s]  but pop fly on the infield again couldn't get to it dribbling towards
[13573.38s -> 13577.74s]  first base and that's why they are not professional basketball players he's
[13577.74s -> 13582.84s]  safe not a professional track player either as Albertson tripping over his
[13582.84s -> 13586.52s]  own feet down that first base line eventually did make it though good run
[13586.52s -> 13592.56s]  here but we'll watch the lack of form here from the umpire Albertson I mean
[13592.60s -> 13597.28s]  Jack Ford he nearly pulled that off it would have been awfully impressive but
[13597.28s -> 13602.08s]  you know Albertson for an umpire you think he'd understand that you can run
[13602.08s -> 13609.52s]  through first base sure yeah one would think but who knows what's going on in
[13609.52s -> 13614.72s]  the mind of Albertson how sweets would it be if Hunter after being plunked by
[13614.72s -> 13618.80s]  two pitches in this game ends up being the hero it's a fly ball in the left
[13618.80s -> 13622.24s]  field they were playing extremely shallow it's over his head look out
[13622.24s -> 13627.56s]  Albertson rounding second he's headed towards third the throw in from right
[13627.56s -> 13634.68s]  field is high Albertson is going for home nobody there covering a late throw
[13634.68s -> 13640.60s]  home and Albertson is safe we've got a one run game in advancing to third is
[13640.60s -> 13645.82s]  Hunter sweets with just one out I got just more impressed with some of the
[13645.82s -> 13649.92s]  shaving cream or the pie the face still Albertson out there still running hard
[13649.92s -> 13657.96s]  he's got pie remnants on his jersey pie remnants on his deck still able to make
[13657.96s -> 13665.64s]  it first at home great speed from Albertson you have never seen it look he's I can't
[13665.64s -> 13669.56s]  shake hand he's got he has to stay impartial so great job there from I have
[13669.56s -> 13673.68s]  never seen I have never seen better professionality from a from an umpire
[13673.68s -> 13679.04s]  in this league in all of my years in this I you know what Gary this is my
[13679.04s -> 13682.28s]  third year in this league I've never seen anything like that and meanwhile we
[13682.28s -> 13690.59s]  get another drive that'll split the gap in left-center David Honk has done it he
[13690.59s -> 13698.15s]  has tied us up 15 all this game it can't get any more bunkers we've had
[13698.15s -> 13704.71s]  streakers 15 runs now a piece this game is crazy and we were tied here with one
[13704.71s -> 13709.67s]  down in the bottom of the ninth inning extra innings looming here at Cardio
[13709.71s -> 13718.47s]  field and that was a drive right there great swing you know I feel like we
[13718.47s -> 13720.79s]  haven't seen a streaker in a while I wonder if he's gonna make another
[13720.79s -> 13726.27s]  appearance but you think he did provide a spark for the magicians and if you're
[13726.27s -> 13731.39s]  the you're the manager for the magicians coach handsome you're wondering where
[13731.39s -> 13735.79s]  that streaker is maybe get some of that hot yoga lovin and any ballplayer would
[13735.79s -> 13744.15s]  tell you nothing to spark a rally like a good dump truck sir one out runner at
[13744.15s -> 13747.83s]  second base line shot towards short it's off the end of his webbing into
[13747.83s -> 13751.39s]  centerfield and the throw into third base they've got him caught in a pickle
[13751.39s -> 13755.71s]  but it gets past his glove off the facing of the dugout so that nearly
[13755.71s -> 13761.71s]  would have been another run home in a potential game ender but instead we've
[13761.71s -> 13766.43s]  got runners on the corners with one down yeah a heads-up play to take that
[13766.43s -> 13774.79s]  third base on that left side the winning run now just 90 feet away that just ate
[13774.79s -> 13780.03s]  the shortstop up couldn't get the glove out on it and Aaron throw a good throw
[13780.03s -> 13785.07s]  just too much mustard on that bun and got beyond the glove of the third
[13785.07s -> 13791.68s]  baseman a fastball thrown by the center fielder third baseman unable to haul it
[13791.68s -> 13799.64s]  in so a fantastic chance here California circus to sneak in a victory
[13799.64s -> 13804.40s]  and come from behind victory they were down 8 to 2 at one point in this game
[13804.40s -> 13809.64s]  they were up 11 to 8 then they were trailed again and they tied it so back
[13809.64s -> 13814.96s]  and forth we go in this seesaw battle between the magicians and the circus
[13814.96s -> 13820.52s]  enjoy handsome is telling his team look guys I was standing on the top step step
[13820.52s -> 13824.96s]  of the dugout looking pretty up by two and now what have you guys done to me
[13824.96s -> 13829.20s]  handsome is as handsome does and right now the play of the magicians not so
[13829.20s -> 13837.94s]  handsome all knotted at 15 in the bottom of the night majestic man oh look at
[13837.94s -> 13849.13s]  this a whole bundle of bats for Sean Giggles and it looks like crew chief
[13849.13s -> 13854.81s]  Elbertson is allowing this I think it's a ten bat max moving can have so he's
[13854.81s -> 13860.30s]  still under the limit here and now they're gonna say the third baseman is
[13860.30s -> 13868.24s]  out in another hidden ball trick oh my goodness two down now the magicians pull
[13868.24s -> 13873.52s]  a rabbit out of their hat at the most crucial point of this game boy the
[13873.52s -> 13878.68s]  magicians Alliance is really gonna like that one the game winning run cut down
[13878.68s -> 13887.93s]  from third base now that game winner would have to come from first a heavy
[13887.97s -> 13897.34s]  batter here in a multitude of ways the first pitch comes in tall g-double-o-d-e-y-e
[13897.34s -> 13911.89s]  good eye good eye the pitch and he dribbles it back to the mound no problem for
[13911.89s -> 13916.13s]  Jack Port you gotta we've got free baseball you gotta wonder what the weight
[13916.13s -> 13922.09s]  of the bats you know implementer you know really affected that hit you'd have
[13922.09s -> 13927.21s]  to think a little bit as we get set for the 10th inning of play you're watching
[13927.21s -> 14021.50s]  the JVA on Twitch welcome back to car shield field in the extra innings of a
[14021.50s -> 14028.92s]  15-15 ball game and another power card coming out the start extras triple
[14028.92s -> 14034.58s]  vision there will be three pitchers on the mound for the circus here in the top
[14034.62s -> 14038.70s]  half of the 10th I've heard of the foreigner double vision but the triple
[14038.70s -> 14045.14s]  vision is a new one on me so we'll see how this affects the circus as two more
[14045.14s -> 14049.46s]  pitchers have been called in or see the effects the magicians is two more
[14049.46s -> 14054.14s]  pitchers will be called to the mound to make it a free spot and it will only be
[14054.14s -> 14059.50s]  for one at bat so this lead-off batter will have to face three pitchers
[14059.50s -> 14068.55s]  simultaneously
[14072.55s -> 14077.27s]  he's not on the roster let's see if Albertson will allow this I do believe
[14077.27s -> 14085.63s]  there are shorts and players need extra baseballs here as well the clown boy ran
[14085.63s -> 14096.95s]  out of balls leave it to the clown boy there's clown boy the great job of
[14096.95s -> 14103.47s]  replenishing Albertson's balls here tonight really been a big favorite of
[14103.47s -> 14108.99s]  mine throughout my years in this league just a model of consistency and one of
[14108.99s -> 14112.47s]  the all-time good guys in this league yeah it gets a lot of respect around the
[14112.47s -> 14116.83s]  league does a good job shining the bats rubbing the balls down getting them
[14116.83s -> 14121.51s]  ready for a BP and just doing whatever a clown boy can do to help the team you
[14121.51s -> 14126.31s]  know another one of those things that goes unnoticed who would rub these
[14126.31s -> 14130.43s]  balls down if it weren't for him nope I mean it had to be one of the players
[14130.43s -> 14134.23s]  maybe they had to rub their own balls so look at this first three pitches come
[14134.23s -> 14141.71s]  in and Albertson nearly wore three of them so so we got strike one as well as
[14141.71s -> 14145.79s]  a couple of balls delivered there so a two-and-one count here to Craig mystery
[14145.79s -> 14150.11s]  who is two for five in this game mystery hasn't been a mystery at the plate so
[14150.11s -> 14153.95s]  far so if it's a good wood on a couple of heads and had some bad ball luck on
[14153.95s -> 14165.92s]  the others just unmatched here they come oh he made contact one-on-ones in play
[14165.92s -> 14171.64s]  look out here and with the power card he still reaches first Aaron throw he's
[14171.64s -> 14176.20s]  headed to second base still ever retrieve that baseball mystery headed to
[14176.20s -> 14182.44s]  third and the leadoff man is just 90 feet away still nobody out waiting for
[14182.44s -> 14188.44s]  the throw and home oh but the other two balls are still in play
[14188.44s -> 14192.48s]  boy applies the time
[14200.91s -> 14205.55s]  oh you did all three balls only going at two of the three balls gonna have three
[14205.55s -> 14210.35s]  balls to complete the cycle oh my goodness how could they have forgotten
[14211.03s -> 14217.23s]  it look now this is this is unwarranted Hunter sweets taking his anger out on
[14217.23s -> 14220.83s]  clown boy clown boy was in the right spot at the right time yeah right spot
[14220.83s -> 14227.15s]  the right time he can't blame clown boy on this one and you wonder how that that
[14227.15s -> 14231.23s]  affects this the team chemistry moving forward I know it's not every day that
[14231.23s -> 14235.31s]  clown boy gets into the game but he's got to feel awfully unappreciated in a
[14235.31s -> 14239.07s]  moment like this I mean look at the way a hunter sweets ran into his own pitcher
[14239.07s -> 14242.99s]  and then he's gonna try to clown clown boy yeah you know come on come play
[14242.99s -> 14248.24s]  there's no climbing club that's just terrible so that should have been the
[14248.24s -> 14253.27s]  winning run but we're continuing here we're still in the top half yeah we're
[14253.27s -> 14258.72s]  gonna oh it's top half of the 10th inning here my bad it has been a long
[14258.72s -> 14262.96s]  night of baseball I will I just keep thinking I'm hoping Dumbledore is okay
[14262.96s -> 14267.28s]  I mean he got pinned in the locker room and just hope he's fine
[14268.59s -> 14273.67s]  he's found the elder one and that one's in for the call strike oh two and oh my
[14273.67s -> 14279.79s]  goodness everyone clearing the bench for the magicians oh my goodness this is bad
[14279.79s -> 14285.23s]  and the pitcher goes down in a heap Fred circus just clinging for his life what
[14285.23s -> 14288.19s]  is happening all the mascots are looking for one another oh they're taking their
[14288.19s -> 14293.27s]  mascot oh boy this utter chaos all the mascots are stripping down to their
[14293.27s -> 14298.23s]  skivvies and going at it every player from every from the magicians and the
[14298.23s -> 14303.99s]  circus are on the field right now how is Albertson going to handle this one he's
[14303.99s -> 14308.03s]  just tossing people left and right now the magicians have cleared the dugout
[14308.03s -> 14313.71s]  beer man is on the field fans have stormed the playing surface this is
[14313.71s -> 14319.84s]  insane boy the mascots are really going at a little hanky-panky play played right
[14319.88s -> 14327.16s]  now I have never seen a higher stakes game of hanky-panky in my life oh and a
[14327.16s -> 14331.72s]  big field goal kick of the clown mascot head oh and a takedown by the wizard
[14331.72s -> 14337.92s]  this is an absolute mess the crunch time is gonna have a one hell of a time
[14337.92s -> 14342.72s]  breaking down this game to see crunch time our postgame analysis coming right
[14342.72s -> 14348.48s]  after this yeah Albertson's called it Albertson has called this oh my goodness
[14348.48s -> 14353.20s]  we'll sort it all out in postgame this this is insane into the clown show this
[14353.20s -> 14357.60s]  game has been called it what really no surprise that this one would end this
[14357.60s -> 14361.88s]  way in 10 innings what a game we're gonna toss it to studio Tom Chairman and
[14361.88s -> 14379.80s]  Dickie Dreck take it away back to another episode of crunch time I'm Tom
[14379.80s -> 14384.96s]  Chairman and I'm Dickie Dreck and once again it's that time time to take a look
[14384.96s -> 14389.44s]  at some league highlights from today's games and boy oh boy it was a heck of a
[14389.44s -> 14394.12s]  day on the ball field indeed it was a doozy of a day Dickie let's dive right
[14394.12s -> 14397.72s]  in go to the diamond for the first game of the afternoon where the Delaware
[14397.72s -> 14402.72s]  drunkards dally with the Montpellier Mimes well fans were treated to another
[14402.72s -> 14408.52s]  classic matchup as the Mimes outfoxed the drunkards in all aspects of the game
[14408.52s -> 14429.88s]  as they usually do hitting pitching fielding and stealing pitcher Marvin
[14429.88s -> 14436.41s]  Mute was in marvelous midseason form pitching a true no-hitter and the
[14436.41s -> 14443.56s]  outfield posted another error-free game yeah it certainly didn't help that the
[14443.56s -> 14448.96s]  drunkards played true to form fielding only four semi-sober players against a
[14448.96s -> 14460.45s]  full complement of Mimes at least the drunkards have consistency going for
[14460.45s -> 14466.01s]  them with a record of one win and 39 straight losses their only victory
[14466.01s -> 14470.09s]  resulting from a forfeit on their home opener when the circus were forced to
[14470.09s -> 14480.45s]  forfeit due to their teen bus breaking down on the highway now let's move
[14480.45s -> 14484.57s]  across the country to where the powerful and primal Phoenix cavemen hosted the
[14484.57s -> 14490.09s]  lovely and long in the tooth Ohio old ladies it was yet another epically long
[14490.09s -> 14494.37s]  contest between these teams that we affectionately call beauty and the beast
[14494.37s -> 14501.37s]  the cavemen played true to form meaning all brawn absolutely no brains and the
[14501.37s -> 14506.53s]  old ladies were as always their charming generous selves valuing hospitality
[14506.53s -> 14511.11s]  camaraderie and friendship over competition as they usually do it's
[14511.11s -> 14515.39s]  really a wonder the cavemen survive in the league after so many years of still
[14515.39s -> 14520.59s]  not understanding at all how the game is played but there's no denying that
[14520.59s -> 14526.24s]  hitting is where their strength lies caveman left fielder Thronk and short
[14526.24s -> 14531.00s]  stop Booga currently lead the league in home runs and runs batted in and today's
[14531.00s -> 14535.84s]  game was another eight-hour ordeal with fans certainly getting their money's
[14535.84s -> 14541.24s]  worth as both teams had no issues with pace of gameplay yep the fans truly
[14541.36s -> 14546.16s]  appreciate the joy just all around Midwest Ohio niceness the old ladies
[14546.16s -> 14550.72s]  bring to the field every night have you Ohio old ladies are leading the league
[14550.72s -> 14557.32s]  in number of walks and strikeouts due to I say this nicely being very selective
[14557.32s -> 14561.08s]  at the plate also leading the league in number of times telling you you look
[14561.08s -> 14565.64s]  like skin and bones eat something but today fans were treated to a rare bases
[14565.64s -> 14570.60s]  loaded hit by Clara crinoline her hit forced old lady catcher Ethel Laflame
[14570.64s -> 14575.60s]  who was on third base due to a walk and then a block to speed toward home
[14575.60s -> 14581.23s]  unfortunately cavemen designated hitter duty was confused by the base runner and
[14581.23s -> 14584.71s]  mistakenly thought she was heading toward the dugout to steal his turkey
[14584.71s -> 14590.47s]  leg so he left out of the dugout to defend what he saw as his territory good
[14590.47s -> 14595.95s]  news is the umpire awarded Ethel home plate and Clara got her first RBI of
[14595.95s -> 14600.47s]  the season what a moment yeah real team player that Ethel what a spirit and
[14600.83s -> 14604.95s]  what a turkey like yeah the cavemen beat more than just Ethel they beat the
[14604.95s -> 14612.88s]  entire team in a 26 to 1 clubbing all right before we wrap up crunch time we
[14612.88s -> 14618.20s]  have some new details we'd like to share with you surrounding the all out benches
[14618.20s -> 14622.08s]  clearing brawl during the California circus and Maryland magicians game
[14622.08s -> 14627.20s]  today what a mess taking absolute mess you hate to see it the melee of merry
[14627.20s -> 14636.16s]  men as it's already becoming known or Jeremy Albertson did his best to quell
[14636.20s -> 14640.44s]  the two teams but for the history they've got against each other this is
[14640.44s -> 14645.28s]  quite a task a bean for a bean you said it both teams believing they're the
[14645.28s -> 14649.68s]  better but least appreciated entertainers this folly turn fracas
[14649.68s -> 14655.00s]  surpassed all previous skirmishes both benches cleared as did the bullpen and
[14655.00s -> 14659.40s]  the locker rooms and it's kind of unfortunate to note here what we're
[14659.40s -> 14663.32s]  learning now the magicians initially charged out of their dugout not with
[14663.36s -> 14669.47s]  any violent intent but seems desperately attempting to escape what looks like an
[14669.47s -> 14674.52s]  animal of some sort that got into their dugout what is that tensions flaring
[14674.52s -> 14677.52s]  that high it's no wonder the circus went right into action but again just
[14677.52s -> 14681.92s]  unfortunate to think of all the kids there too and the animals will soon see
[14681.92s -> 14686.16s]  how the league's going to respond but you have to figure at least a handful of
[14686.16s -> 14690.10s]  suspensions will come out of this debacle but that's all the time we have
[14690.10s -> 14694.98s]  to crunch today we'll be back tomorrow with more league highlights and until
[14694.98s -> 14699.26s]  then I'm Tom Chairman and I'm Dicky Dreck and you've been watching crunch
[14699.26s -> 14699.78s]  time
