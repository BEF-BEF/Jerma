[2.36s -> 13.51s]  Let's see if I can do it with Samson. All fingers are pointing to no. So, let's go guys.
[18.42s -> 27.61s]  So, wait, what? Why do I have a spirit heart? I'm not exactly sure why that happened. Envy right
[27.61s -> 34.65s]  off the bat. But okay, so Samson, the way Samson works, every time you hit an enemy, you get
[34.65s -> 39.29s]  stronger tiers. Like every five to 10 hits or something like that, you get stronger. See how
[39.29s -> 46.50s]  I'm turning red? I got like a pink kind of tinge to my body right now. It means I'm doing a little
[46.50s -> 53.29s]  bit more damage. Every hit. But as you can tell, he has only one heart, so it's just like, nope,
[53.29s -> 60.73s]  you're gonna die. Why is Envy in like the first room and the first level? That's just a lot of
[60.73s -> 74.92s]  malarkey, if you ask me. Oh my god, why is this guy blue? That guy's like a grape. Hello from
[74.92s -> 84.12s]  Alabama. Hello from Boston. City of Boston. Well, I can't believe I didn't get a hit. City of hot dogs,
[84.12s -> 96.84s]  bright lights, and a Boston Red Sox. Well, that didn't take forever. Is it every kill? Okay,
[96.84s -> 102.98s]  it's every kill then. So, he can be pretty, if you get a lot of HP up, he can be pretty powerful.
[104.54s -> 107.58s]  But of course, we're in the spider room, so I'm probably gonna die like right now.
[110.68s -> 119.82s]  Oh god, this is the worst. If I die in this room, I swear I should have already been dead,
[119.82s -> 126.14s]  to be honest. I don't know where that spirit heart even came from. I should be dead right now.
[126.14s -> 131.18s]  But I'm gonna take it to stride. You know what, I got a second chance. It's time to do this thing.
[135.22s -> 146.14s]  All right, come on. Come on, you like cupcake. You meat cupcake. Let's get that item. Have I
[146.14s -> 151.37s]  met the scout in Boston? Yeah, I see him like riding his bike all the time.
[152.09s -> 156.74s]  He's always like riding around wicked fast, like a psycho.
[163.05s -> 168.02s]  Oh, so he got buffed. That's what it is. All right. Well, what about Judas? I mean,
[168.58s -> 172.74s]  so would you, why would you ever play as Judas now? Isn't Judas have one heart or does he have two?
[173.46s -> 180.42s]  Because I mean, if that's a buff, I can't think of a reason why you would ever play
[181.06s -> 185.69s]  as anybody else. If you go over Judas, at least. Come on, blow up the secret room.
[187.98s -> 192.14s]  Okay, I don't think I'm gonna make it. I don't think I'm gonna do this. Yep, it's,
[192.14s -> 195.82s]  it's widow. I don't think I'm gonna do this, guys. I might have to start this over again.
[197.05s -> 207.53s]  Oh no, no way. No way. Not a chance. Not a chance. We're gonna reach right. Okay. All right,
[207.53s -> 213.08s]  hopefully I don't run into the spider boss again. I don't think I will because we're not in the
[213.08s -> 219.80s]  spider catacomb place right now. Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna rage. Not gonna rage you yet.
[223.14s -> 229.06s]  Homing shots. Good, good, good, good, good. Hey, it's always good to get your Binding of Isaac
[229.06s -> 233.46s]  deaths out of the way in the very beginning. Especially when you play on the stupid spider
[233.46s -> 243.58s]  level. That's way too hot. I think the spider level shouldn't be able, like, to spawn until,
[243.58s -> 248.30s]  like, the second, at least the second or third run. Because if you're playing as a character
[248.30s -> 253.18s]  like this, it's, there's no way you're gonna beat that spider boss with one heart. There's no way.
[254.44s -> 256.44s]  I mean, I guess you could if you were really good.
[261.96s -> 267.96s]  All right, doing much better. Let's continue down here.
[272.89s -> 278.97s]  Yeah, I was a little late today to the stream. And that's because I actually went out last night
[278.97s -> 285.98s]  for the first time in a very long time. And I got a little under the weather, as they say.
[286.62s -> 295.22s]  Heh. And I woke up a little too late. But, hmm, should I get the key and get the crate?
[295.22s -> 300.97s]  Why am I saying crate? Too many games do crates lately. No, we're not gonna do that yet.
[300.97s -> 306.79s]  I don't think it's worth it. Yeah, unless you're, like, a character like Kane or,
[306.79s -> 311.27s]  even Isaac can probably do it, but all the other, oh, Magdalen can, you can do with Magdalen.
[311.83s -> 325.70s]  Let's keep going this way. Get out of here, you bugs. Whoa, didn't even see that guy. That guy
[325.70s -> 338.20s]  came out of nowhere. I didn't even check my rearview mirror. How could you ever delete
[338.20s -> 347.94s]  the binding of Isaac? This game is too good. Everything about this game is good. Except
[347.94s -> 354.73s]  there's one bad part about this game. It has to end. Like, when you're playing, it has to be,
[354.73s -> 368.52s]  like, over. Ooh, ace of spades. The ace of spades. No, not doing that. Not with Samson.
[369.24s -> 381.34s]  Oh, let me walk over the spikes. That's a great idea. Oh, I want that chest. But I don't want
[381.34s -> 388.68s]  that chest, because it might be something not worth it. Decisions, decisions. Oh, you know what?
[388.68s -> 397.03s]  Yolo, you only live once. Let's do it. I'm opening this chest. All right, give me something good.
[397.83s -> 409.11s]  Oh, yeah. That was so worth it. Oh, well, you know what? You gotta take risks sometimes.
[410.50s -> 420.07s]  It's not gonna pay off sometimes, apparently. All right, let's go whoop this guy's butt.
[420.95s -> 429.74s]  All right, Mastro. Oh, two Mastros. That's not ever a good thing. And you gotta fight two of
[429.74s -> 445.48s]  the same Mastro. Come on, Burger Boy. Come on, Burger Boy. Oh, come on. Why did it have to be
[445.48s -> 454.04s]  Monstros? They're just, they're so happy. I feel like these guys aren't even really trying to hurt
[454.04s -> 457.64s]  me. They're just trying to like play. You look at them, they're just like, hey, I just want to
[457.64s -> 482.76s]  jump and throw up. Will one of them just go away? Just go away. Come on. Oh, my God, Samson, you
[482.76s -> 489.96s]  bastard. Why is this still two? Okay, geez, it took to like 10% health to get one of these
[489.96s -> 504.44s]  bastards out of here. Okay, we're good to go. Two hearts. We got it. Do I have any bombs?
[505.74s -> 514.90s]  I do not have any bombs, so I gotta just go. Who is Burger Boy, really? Burger Boy is one, oh,
[514.90s -> 522.65s]  Curse of Darkness. This is, ugh. Burger Boy is one of my real life good friends. And he's also
[522.65s -> 528.74s]  crazy. But that's good. That's like a good quality. Because we're all crazy.
[533.32s -> 541.10s]  But Burger Boy is also the egg. And there's a, uh, might be a special video coming soon.
[541.74s -> 548.26s]  Coming soon. Not like tomorrow, not like next week. But there might be the return of the egg.
[548.26s -> 561.22s]  That's the only thing I'm going to say. The egg. Best worst character ever.
[564.44s -> 572.47s]  All right, what's this? The Emperor. All right. Forget what you do, but that's all right.
[576.89s -> 580.09s]  You know, I'm actually one of those people that really liked Meet the Pyro.
[580.81s -> 583.53s]  A lot of people liked it, but a lot of people really didn't like it either.
[584.25s -> 588.79s]  I'll tell you one thing, though. I think Meet the Pyro was too short. If there's one complaint I
[588.79s -> 594.44s]  have about Meet the Pyro, it was too short. Because, I mean, they gave us Meet the Spy,
[594.44s -> 598.76s]  which was like three and a half minutes. Then they gave us Meet the Medic, which was like
[598.76s -> 602.92s]  four minutes. And then it's like, oh man, they're getting crazier and crazier. Like,
[602.92s -> 607.64s]  more cinematic and more cinematic as they go. And then Meet the Pyro was like two minutes and
[607.64s -> 617.42s]  22 seconds. That's the only complaint I have. Now I teleport you to the boss room. Good to know.
[617.42s -> 628.62s]  Good to know. Am I? All right, I must be crazy. I have another spirit heart. Did I walk over one
[628.62s -> 633.56s]  and just not even pay attention? Or do you, every time you kill like 20 people at Samson,
[633.56s -> 644.55s]  you get a spirit heart? Maybe I'm just crazy. But I mean, after the interview, I think they
[644.55s -> 648.52s]  could have done the interview stuff a little bit longer. You know, when the spy's like,
[648.52s -> 653.08s]  what kind of inhumane, just horrible, disgusting thoughts, or whatever he says.
[653.72s -> 656.44s]  If they fleshed that out a little bit more, maybe get a couple more characters,
[656.44s -> 662.97s]  like get the sniper to say some stuff. Let's do it. I'm not going in that room.
[664.97s -> 677.77s]  They blew the budget on the special effects. Get away from me. This guy's gonna be hard to kill
[678.97s -> 686.09s]  with this spoon. It's gonna, oh no, it's gonna like attack the things around him and not him.
[686.81s -> 695.48s]  It's all right. I can wait it out. I'm also glad that the Pyro's gender is a secret to the couple
[695.48s -> 700.12s]  of you guys that are saying that right now. I don't know. When you have a mystery like that,
[700.92s -> 704.58s]  you got to keep it a mystery. It's just like when you read a book,
[705.22s -> 709.14s]  right? If I read a book, and it's like, you don't know what the character looks like,
[709.14s -> 713.78s]  you get to make up your own kind of version of the character. Because everybody has their own Pyro.
[714.34s -> 720.82s]  I mean, and I'll bring up a friend of mine, Boo. You guys know Boo. Boo has like the best
[720.82s -> 727.46s]  perfect description of the Pyro. It's just like a cute, just like cuddly little entity that runs
[727.46s -> 734.18s]  around and just has fun. Like that there is no man or woman. It's just the Pyro. I think that's
[734.18s -> 749.42s]  perfect. The Pyro is not a man or a woman. It is a thing. It's just a mindset. It's an entity. Okay,
[749.42s -> 761.18s]  I'm absolutely not doing either of those. Ew, who reads books? I not miss. I gotta go. I gotta go
[761.18s -> 774.86s]  down. I would use the Source Filmmaker if I had any idea how to use it. The Source Filmmaker is
[774.86s -> 778.70s]  one of those things where you really have to sit down and like play with it and be good with it and
[778.70s -> 786.92s]  learn. And artistically, I was never really like an art student. I mean, I can, I went to school for
[786.92s -> 792.76s]  film. I could probably use it. I could probably like do like shots with it and stuff. But once
[792.76s -> 799.00s]  you get to the animation part of things, there's no way I would ever know what to do with that
[799.00s -> 803.80s]  program. Because I've tried Garry's mod, even just like do little dumb animations and little
[803.80s -> 809.96s]  dumb things in Garry's mod. And they always end up as complete atrocities. Like complete,
[809.96s -> 814.20s]  like just horrible things. Like, oh, I want to get like the heavy to smile and point his finger.
[814.20s -> 819.08s]  And he just ends up going like, oh, get it. Like his hand comes up. I'm just not good with art.
[820.78s -> 834.42s]  Wish I was though. Mini greed. Oh no, please don't kill me. Wow. Wow. I was going to say it.
[834.42s -> 841.40s]  There's no way I'm that lucky to dodge like five of the cut. Oh my God. Now I'm just being an idiot.
[845.37s -> 859.03s]  It's these stupid things that are in the way. Supposed to have homing shots. Come on now.
[859.03s -> 867.38s]  Oh, I hate epic hack. I absolutely hate epic hack, but I'm going to take it. I really don't
[867.38s -> 873.21s]  like epic hack and it's probably going to kill me. But you know what? I'm going to take it.
[873.93s -> 882.58s]  Let's see if I can find the secret room. Is this a full heart up here? Okay, there's two. Good to know.
[887.91s -> 895.67s]  Oh no, no, no, it's homing too. Oh my God, I forgot about that. Oh man, this is bad. This is
[895.67s -> 905.24s]  really bad. This is really bad. I'm going to kill myself with this. Guaranteed because it's homing.
[909.88s -> 927.96s]  Oh no. Oh no. I'm blowing this up. Cool. Yeah, this is definitely a run that is in the tank,
[927.96s -> 936.65s]  in my opinion. There's just no way I'm going to do this because it's homing. I will open you though.
[936.65s -> 956.68s]  Oh, it's over. Oh, and it's over. I'm getting out of here. I can't believe I survived that.
[959.48s -> 965.64s]  The only thing this is going to be good for is bosses. That's it. Barely, barely that.
[975.24s -> 981.34s]  Boom. What did I have for dinner last night? I think I had a chicken sandwich.
[982.14s -> 988.95s]  Pretty sure. Oh wow. I can't believe I got hit by that.
[991.75s -> 995.83s]  Hmm. This is taking so much longer because I have to keep going back and healing myself.
[996.47s -> 1005.96s]  No super secret room there. Super secret room is probably all the way to the right,
[1005.96s -> 1018.30s]  if there is one here. Oh God. Super wrath, huh? I don't think I've never faced super wrath.
[1019.46s -> 1027.59s]  Oh no, he does not do that. He does troll bombs, like the big ones that follow you.
[1028.31s -> 1038.87s]  I guess it doesn't really matter because he's dead. Blast damage. Does blast damage incorporate
[1040.57s -> 1052.10s]  epic hack shots? Oh, I hope so. Why am I not watching the soccer finals? I'm not a big soccer
[1052.10s -> 1062.49s]  guy. I never really was. I grew up on baseball. Baseball is my thing. Versus peep. Oh, well,
[1062.49s -> 1071.93s]  this might be like good. Maybe I'll like kill him easily with this epic hack. Oh God. Yeah,
[1072.49s -> 1085.21s]  I'm gonna be good. I'll be good to go. Epic hack. Oh God. Boink. I'll take the tears up,
[1085.21s -> 1101.03s]  even though I don't really want it. And let's go. Yeah, I'm definitely dead soon. I am absolutely
[1101.03s -> 1109.56s]  dead soon. Oh, screw you. You aren't getting any of my hearts. You aren't getting my heart.
[1116.73s -> 1123.54s]  Actually, that's not that bad as long as you stay away from it. Favorite baseball team is the Boston
[1123.54s -> 1137.46s]  Red Sox. I live in Boston, so I don't live in Boston. I live right next to it. We'll put it
[1137.46s -> 1154.66s]  that way. Boing. Get smashed. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. I can't shoot this. Come on. Oh, come on.
[1157.98s -> 1168.10s]  This is the worst. This is the worst. This is the worst thing. Ah. What's this? Poison bombs. Cool.
[1168.90s -> 1177.77s]  Well, I think this is the end of Sampson. Let's find out. Unless I get a heart right here. The sun.
[1177.77s -> 1185.53s]  Okay. I'm gonna stay alive. What's in this next room? Goodbye. Sorry. I was not dealing with that.
[1185.53s -> 1198.38s]  Not a chance. I'm probably not gonna do a GTA 4 let's play or a walkthrough. GTA 5, though.
[1199.34s -> 1205.50s]  I will probably do a some type of walkthrough. Maybe a let's play or something, because I love
[1205.50s -> 1217.06s]  GTA games so much. I can't shoot that. Go in here. Of course it's greed. Wilds wouldn't be anybody
[1217.06s -> 1226.89s]  else but greed. At least it's a steam sale. Mike Lowell is my favorite Red Sox player of all time.
[1229.74s -> 1251.43s]  Mike Lowell. Epic hack. You are the worst. Oh, I want that. It's good for those guys. I will
[1251.43s -> 1275.58s]  say that for sure. Okay. No. No. No. No. Get away. Good. I'm stuck. Get. I can't hit these bugs.
[1276.38s -> 1295.32s]  Strike one. Strike two. Strike three. Strike four. Okay. There we go. All right, boss. I am
[1295.32s -> 1301.56s]  shocked that I've gotten this far. I am like legitimately shocked. You know, we're gonna do
[1301.56s -> 1308.98s]  this. Ready? Hey, what's going on? What's going on, buddy? How you doing? You want like some of my
[1308.98s -> 1320.63s]  hots? Eat this! I missed. Eat this! Run. Who's talking to me? I'm getting tweets all over the place.
[1324.09s -> 1330.68s]  All right, let's fight this guy. Oh, fantastic. Well, it was nice knowing you guys. I'm sure I'll
[1331.72s -> 1342.07s]  be like in the afterlife as Samson. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe not. Wow. All right. I'll take that.
[1343.03s -> 1354.76s]  I'll take a swift victory. Oh, I want. Mommy. Curse of the labyrinth. That's exactly what I wanted.
[1354.76s -> 1364.36s]  That's. I'm glad. Oh, no. No, boy. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I can't even. I can't even
[1364.36s -> 1374.52s]  handle this right now. Yeah. Well, now it. Now the jig is up. Unless I pull off some real, real
[1374.52s -> 1381.78s]  ridiculous moves. I am not doing this. Oh, bombs are key. I actually would rather have that. Thank
[1381.78s -> 1388.63s]  you. This could be the end right here. I'm going to. I'm going to probably say time to be quiet.
[1388.63s -> 1392.39s]  Go to try hard mode and not scream when I die, because that's probably what I'm going to do.
[1414.71s -> 1422.81s]  All right. OK. As long as you take it slow and steady.
[1423.69s -> 1434.36s]  Just like the turtle. You don't got to be. You don't got to be the hare. OK, but now. Oh, no.
[1434.36s -> 1456.78s]  Oh. All right. It hurts every time playing this game. I might want to just go. I don't know.
[1458.07s -> 1472.87s]  I don't know. I have one heart now. I'll die. I need more stuff. That's not what I needed.
[1474.26s -> 1486.82s]  I'm afraid to even attempt to get in here. Oh, my. You know, it was going to happen.
[1486.90s -> 1491.40s]  I just. I got it. I got it over with. I got over with on purpose.
[1500.04s -> 1509.05s]  How come that killed me, by the way? I thought it only did. I thought it only did
[1509.61s -> 1520.44s]  one half heart. Why did I die from that? Oh, whatever. Let's just go straight up,
[1520.44s -> 1535.56s]  Isaac. Isaac never did me wrong. Samson, you're too hard with your no hearts. I'm going to take
[1535.56s -> 1543.75s]  this game by the horns with Isaac. Tack fly. That's a good start. I'm going to beat this right
[1543.75s -> 1560.23s]  now. You see, that just made me so sad that I'm going to beat this now. The key. All right. All
[1560.23s -> 1573.54s]  right. OK. Come on, flies. What do you got against Isaac? I'm speaking about those spikes again.
[1573.54s -> 1579.30s]  I swear that I mean, I had one heart. Why would it do more than one heart worth of damage?
[1579.30s -> 1586.81s]  Maybe they changed it or maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand. Oh, yeah. Keep throwing
[1586.81s -> 1599.26s]  your bugs at me and then you run them over yourself. Hi, Zach. Hi, Zach. Actually, I'd rather
[1599.26s -> 1610.20s]  stay up here keeping from moving around so much. Whoa. Wow. There you go. Kill your own dudes.
[1610.76s -> 1622.47s]  That's what I like to say. Now, that's what I like to say, son. Not that, though. Get away.
[1623.61s -> 1637.35s]  Whoa. Dodging bullets here. You can hit me. You can do better than that. Oh, you could do better
[1637.35s -> 1651.59s]  than that. Cuban meat. Jump. I'm smoking this game. I'm going to smoke this whole game right now
[1652.86s -> 1670.94s]  as the title character as Isaac. Screw that thing. I don't want it. I wish they would come out with
[1671.02s -> 1678.14s]  Binding of Isaac 2 and have it be like not single player. Have it be you can have more than one or
[1678.14s -> 1681.98s]  two people in the game. Oh, probably two. More than more than two would be ridiculous.
[1686.47s -> 1699.82s]  All right, let's go. Cupcake. You velvet cupcake batter. Speed and range up. And I look like a
[1699.82s -> 1715.19s]  freaking psycho. Yeah. Nickel. All right. Got a nickel. Good to go. Let's go, you uncooked chicken.
[1715.83s -> 1727.82s]  You can't kill me. I think Abu was telling me that he 100% of this game, which like that's
[1727.82s -> 1737.42s]  incredible. What a boss. It's not an easy feat to complete like everything in this game.
[1738.22s -> 1745.78s]  Really isn't. See, I use it on the secret room, which is probably right here.
[1752.89s -> 1757.29s]  Well, apparently it wasn't right there. Probably was down this hall somewhere.
[1758.52s -> 1767.35s]  But you know, I can take it. Whatever. My favorite holiday is definitely
[1768.23s -> 1774.30s]  Halloween. I love Halloween more than anything. It's the only time of the year where you are
[1774.30s -> 1782.57s]  allowed to be a freak show and like nobody cares or gets mad. Think of any other night
[1782.57s -> 1790.73s]  the entire year where you are allowed to hang out your car window as the Joker and scream and laugh
[1790.73s -> 1795.05s]  at random like old people on the street. When can you do that? And people will just go, oh,
[1795.05s -> 1805.98s]  he's just being fun. There's not another time in the world where you can do that.
[1806.78s -> 1822.41s]  Oh, you're going to curve your bullets too, huh? Curve the bullets. Angelina Jolie. That's every
[1822.41s -> 1837.94s]  day for me, mad killer. Or the Dark Knight premiere. I guess that is the situation where
[1837.94s -> 1844.94s]  you couldn't do that. Oh, welcome to the Dark Knight premiere. Oh, okay. You can be the Joker
[1844.94s -> 1860.81s]  and like scream at people. That's awesome. Man, I kind of feel like an ice cream cone right now.
[1865.42s -> 1877.26s]  I feel like a big ice cream cone. Oh, these guys aren't that bad. I can handle these guys.
[1877.98s -> 1885.93s]  I can handle these two dudes. Oh, if you're wondering if someone was asking about Team Fortress
[1885.93s -> 1892.09s]  and how come I'm not streaming it or anything, I'm still waiting for a fix. And I think
[1892.09s -> 1897.77s]  there's a beta driver right now for the 670 or the 600 series in general. I'm going to download that
[1897.77s -> 1902.97s]  and try it. It's just I didn't want to spend like an hour or two troubleshooting when I was already
[1902.97s -> 1907.77s]  like an hour late to the stream anyways. So next week we will see what happens with that.
[1908.41s -> 1918.02s]  But for right now, Larry Jr., you're dead and you're not coming back as much as you want to.
[1918.82s -> 1923.16s]  I'm sorry. As much as you want to be in your like fruit punch pool.
[1928.22s -> 1933.54s]  See, this is looking more and more like a clean run every single time.
[1934.18s -> 1953.69s]  Let's go. Four hearts, full. I got no Samsonite to worry about. You need to die. Man, you are a
[1953.69s -> 1959.98s]  persistent son of a... I kept hitting that guy in the face and he just kept going like...
[1959.98s -> 1977.16s]  He's like, get out of my face, man. Get out of my face. Do I play MMOs? Absolutely. I played World
[1977.16s -> 1986.28s]  of Warcraft for over six years. I had multiple max level characters. My main was a warlock. Well,
[1986.28s -> 1998.73s]  actually let me rephrase that. Warrior. Then it was a priest and then it was a warlock and my
[1998.73s -> 2006.95s]  main was the warlock for the most amount of time. But I had a priest, warrior, warlock, druid. God,
[2006.95s -> 2016.97s]  I had everything in that game. But then they did a bunch of weird changes. I don't know why.
[2017.77s -> 2022.81s]  They did a lot of changes. Oh, it's lagging right now? Stream's lagging? What's going on here?
[2026.22s -> 2037.00s]  Are we good? I hope so. It just popped up. Everybody was like, lag, lag, lag.
[2037.00s -> 2045.86s]  Ah! Like my stream is on fire right now. So apparently my stream is like in flames.
[2046.58s -> 2054.23s]  Try refreshing it. Try refreshing it up. Let's see. Hold on. Let's see. Just to make sure I...
[2054.23s -> 2059.70s]  Because a lot of you guys were just saying that it was lagging. Let's take a look here.
[2061.64s -> 2080.22s]  Look at my stream health to make sure it's okay. Events. I have control room. Because it'll tell
[2080.30s -> 2086.82s]  you. It'll be like, oh, your stream is lagging like crazy. It says it's okay.
[2091.00s -> 2099.98s]  So it seems better now. All right. That's good. That's a good thing. All right. Well,
[2100.86s -> 2109.96s]  I apologize about that. Sorry. Somebody just like rolled over and like tripped over my stream
[2109.96s -> 2120.36s]  cord at YouTube somewhere. And then I had to plug it back in real quick. Somebody was eating a
[2120.44s -> 2123.96s]  sandwich and they just like tripped and ripped out my stream cord.
[2135.48s -> 2139.24s]  If you're still getting the lag, try and refresh. Sometimes that fixes it.
[2139.96s -> 2150.25s]  Shouldn't be happening to begin with though. My favorite superhero is...
[2151.77s -> 2159.54s]  Ah, that is a tough question because there are a lot. There are a lot that I could say.
[2160.34s -> 2166.14s]  Oh my god, this room is full of bugs.
[2171.34s -> 2180.95s]  Man, I don't want to say like, oh, Batman, because it really isn't Batman. Or Superman. Or...
[2181.83s -> 2191.96s]  What is his name? I should be able to answer this question in three seconds. I don't know why I
[2191.96s -> 2198.62s]  can't answer this. Superhero. Superhero. Oh, Deadpool. Deadpool. There you go. Probably
[2198.62s -> 2206.50s]  Deadpool. Deadpool or Venom. That took me a long time to say that. Oh, I need more coins.
[2207.30s -> 2214.22s]  ASAP. I'm going to buy this bomb and try to blow up the secret room. See if it's right here.
[2216.52s -> 2221.64s]  But Venom is just such a cool character. I love the way like he is. He just is Venom.
[2222.52s -> 2230.12s]  No, that was the wrong place. It was up top. All right, whatever. Let's a go.
[2233.34s -> 2242.49s]  Gertie. I actually like facing Gertie. I can handle him. I can handle Gertie. Gertie, come on.
[2243.05s -> 2250.94s]  Dodge. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I did not dodge that right at all. There we go. Oh, you're too like
[2251.66s -> 2262.42s]  bubbles of puke. Gotta get rid of those bubbles of puke. I know in Deadpool, because the Deadpool
[2262.42s -> 2268.90s]  comics, if you ever read them, he is insane. He breaks the fourth wall all the time. He'll
[2268.90s -> 2272.42s]  just be like, hey, reader, if you want to like skip this part, go ahead and like go to page 14.
[2272.42s -> 2278.02s]  This part's like pretty boring. I just talked to some broad for like five minutes. I love how
[2278.02s -> 2286.30s]  much he breaks the fourth wall in the Deadpool comics. It's so funny. All right, Gertie,
[2286.30s -> 2292.94s]  that's just about enough of you and your like big smelly body. Oh, come on. You're gonna do
[2292.94s -> 2300.78s]  me like that, Gertie. I keep thinking that eye is not mine and that happens every time.
[2305.86s -> 2312.74s]  Do it again. Come on, do it again. I dare you. I dare you. Oh, he missed. You're stupid.
[2313.70s -> 2327.46s]  Go. The caves. Welcome to the caves. But down here, you never see the light of day again.
[2329.00s -> 2346.33s]  And you almost die from walking into things. What you know, Isaac. I actually, when Vindictus
[2346.33s -> 2353.35s]  first came out, I was, it's free to play, right? I actually was going to download that and I just
[2353.43s -> 2359.54s]  forgot to do it. So thank you for reminding me because I'm going to go download Vindictus
[2359.54s -> 2364.49s]  like right after the stream is done. That's the one where it's like an MMO, but it's like a hack
[2364.49s -> 2371.08s]  and slash kind of like third person. That's the right game I'm thinking of, right? I'll take that
[2371.08s -> 2383.06s]  money. Go ahead, blow up. I'll take that money. It's going here. Now, what do you have for me?
[2383.70s -> 2388.26s]  If you don't have, if I don't win this on the first time, you are dying just to let you know.
[2389.22s -> 2393.26s]  All right. I know you heard me. Do you want to stay alive? We'll find out.
[2393.98s -> 2399.50s]  Oh, it looks like somebody wants to get blown up. No, please. No, please. Yeah. Couldn't even
[2399.50s -> 2414.49s]  finish your sentence. And that's enough of that. Yeah. Definitely downloading Vindictus
[2414.49s -> 2426.46s]  at the end of this stream. And I'm going to play it a bunch. Oh, you turned into like a little
[2426.46s -> 2436.87s]  piece of jello. I feel bad for you. I'm doing it. No, it wasn't worth it for like the seventh time
[2436.87s -> 2449.43s]  in a row. It's never worth it. Me and MLC Stealth played DC Universe for a little while.
[2450.07s -> 2463.03s]  We played for like a few hours at least. A few. Oh, I'm cracking my back. Hours at least. Of
[2463.03s -> 2473.96s]  course it's greed. Of course it's greed. Why would it be anybody else besides greed? Get him, eyeball.
[2475.22s -> 2486.23s]  Show him that. So I just realized something. I am shooting a red tier every other tier. Is that
[2486.23s -> 2499.30s]  because my eye came out? Yeah, it has to be, right? Greed, you bastard. Why don't you go bottle like
[2499.30s -> 2504.79s]  Edward Elric? Like, leave me alone. Never mind. You dropped a lot of money. I like you, now.
[2511.37s -> 2516.84s]  What am I doing standing there? I need to be in the corner. I need to be in the rear view. There
[2516.84s -> 2527.67s]  we go. Don't even need to do that. Uh oh, it's super toothless Joe, whatever his name is.
[2532.26s -> 2541.78s]  These guys freak me out. These guys are scary. I've had all the Warhammer games for a pretty long
[2541.78s -> 2551.59s]  time. If you are a fan of RTS, I would highly recommend you get the original Dawn of War.
[2552.78s -> 2558.78s]  I wasn't a fan of Dawn of War 2. I'm not gonna lie. I thought Dawn of War 2 was a good game,
[2558.78s -> 2567.59s]  but I don't think it was nearly as good as Dawn of War 1. Just quit following me, dude. Come on.
[2567.59s -> 2575.27s]  Come right here. Come on. Come on. Come on. I've got like candy and soda and chips. You know what?
[2575.27s -> 2579.69s]  You're not gonna come down, so I'm just gonna kill you. We're gonna have a party down there,
[2579.69s -> 2593.05s]  but you like didn't feel like coming. That makes me sad. How much fur? There we go. There it is.
[2595.03s -> 2599.59s]  Item room is all the way over there. After this, I'm gonna have to go do that. Get to the item room.
[2601.51s -> 2613.82s]  After all these like toothless freaks. There we go. Speaking of Left 4 Dead 2,
[2613.82s -> 2619.02s]  someone just said Left 4 Dead 2. Didn't they come out with a new map? Coldstream?
[2620.07s -> 2625.35s]  Or Coldland or something? Because whatever it is, I'm definitely gonna be playing a lot of that, too.
[2627.30s -> 2640.47s]  Fork. Isaac's Fork. Okay. Oh, if you're gonna come to the party, you gotta bring like salsa.
[2640.47s -> 2647.90s]  You gotta bring dip, chips, soda, burger patties, frozen hot dogs,
[2650.44s -> 2657.37s]  a love for life, and a good attitude. That's the only way you're allowed my party.
[2665.38s -> 2675.22s]  You sack of marbles. Get out of here. Open. Open. Now open again. I'm the dentist,
[2675.94s -> 2678.74s]  and your teeth need a real cleaning.
[2682.49s -> 2694.82s]  Where's this item room? God, such a big level. This is dumb. Oh my goodness, will you just...
[2694.82s -> 2699.06s]  I need to damage up something because it's taking forever to kill any of these things.
[2699.62s -> 2710.02s]  Open. Open. Yeah, once it comes out, I'll stream Left 4 Dead 2. Once the new map comes out. Open.
[2713.08s -> 2723.11s]  Come on. I didn't even kill him. My little buddy did. Ooh, little Chad. He's so happy.
[2724.79s -> 2733.34s]  Hi, I'm Bill Chad. I'm gonna drop hearts for you. Thanks, little Chad. No problem. So little Chad,
[2733.34s -> 2739.94s]  you're gonna like tell me your life story. Okay, so I grew up in the sewer and then I pooped out
[2739.94s -> 2745.38s]  hearts. That's a touching story, Chad. Thank you. Now give me your hearts before I kill myself
[2745.38s -> 2751.88s]  because I'm pretending to be two people. Okay. Well, that's a good way to lose three hearts.
[2751.88s -> 2765.22s]  Do a little Chad movie. Pills here. No, no. That's the worst. That's the last thing I wanted.
[2771.62s -> 2774.42s]  There is a circus following me right now. Look at this.
[2774.42s -> 2787.26s]  It's like all I need now is a brother Bobby and like more attack flies and I'll be all set.
[2787.98s -> 2803.48s]  Hopefully I don't die. Oh, Chad. Oh, no. Why is he so weak? Or did it? Was that my...
[2805.11s -> 2813.19s]  What just even hurt him? I didn't do that. Hopefully he doesn't kill me. All right. Little
[2813.27s -> 2819.99s]  Chad and big Chad. This is like very surreal. He's fighting his like daddy right now. This is like
[2819.99s -> 2835.91s]  weird. Whose side are you on, son? I stand on the side of light. What's in here? I'm actually kind
[2835.91s -> 2843.45s]  of tempted to take this because I could use the spirit hearts. I think I'm going to take that.
[2844.34s -> 2850.49s]  I really think I'm going to take this right now. Oh, I'm going to take it. I'm going to take it.
[2850.49s -> 2862.84s]  I took it. Thank you. It was a decision I had to make and I made it. I needed it. Oh, God.
[2862.84s -> 2870.73s]  I'm like, why is it crashing? What? What? Oh, for a second there, I thought the game was just
[2870.73s -> 2876.65s]  crashed and done. I was just about to freak out. Did my stream die? We're still streaming,
[2876.65s -> 2889.77s]  right? Okay. You guys saw that. It was just like, you know what? We might even do it again
[2890.41s -> 2903.98s]  at some point if I need it. Oh, pro dodges right there. Pro dodging. I wish there wasn't all these
[2903.98s -> 2913.54s]  obstacles in the way so I could hit them. Oh, that was, that thing was blocking it. That was why.
[2917.62s -> 2926.30s]  Give me this. Give me that. And I'm going to blow this up for sure. Good position now. Too bad I have
[2926.30s -> 2932.62s]  stupid curse of the labyrinth. Whatever this dumb thing does. Makes it so I can't see anything.
[2935.99s -> 2941.62s]  Oh, I want to kill at least mom. I want to kill mom. That big fat...
[2944.41s -> 2957.53s]  Ugh. There we go. Let's go down. I just did this room, man. I just did this room. Okay,
[2957.53s -> 2968.26s]  I'm going the other way. I'm going around. Ugh. There's too much stuff blocking you for me to
[2968.26s -> 2977.80s]  shoot you. See, if I didn't take that guppy's hand and I didn't use it, I probably would be dead right
[2977.80s -> 2989.82s]  now. Because I've been hit at least at least five or six times. Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is really
[2989.82s -> 3001.02s]  bad. Especially this room. Don't spawn anymore. No. No. Get... Ugh. God. I hate spiders. Not only
[3001.02s -> 3023.27s]  in real life, but in fake life too. It's a good thing to take. Guppy. Die. Oh, you hairy...
[3023.83s -> 3028.63s]  This is gonna be so hard. I'm just gonna stay in the corner. No sense going out there and
[3029.19s -> 3036.41s]  meeting my demise like that. Get out of here. Oh, no. Corner's a bad move.
[3042.28s -> 3047.91s]  There has to be this many things in this room. Get out of here, you ba-bomb.
[3053.88s -> 3061.66s]  There's so many of these little guys that shoot. I hate those ones. I actually just
[3061.66s -> 3069.72s]  tried the Samson run. Didn't really work out too well. I got to, like, what, the third or fourth
[3069.72s -> 3087.69s]  run when I died? Ugh. I don't want any of your, like, cream cheese. Get out of here. This is the
[3087.69s -> 3096.28s]  binding of Isaac. Wrath of the Lamb. DLC. And this is me getting stuck and not being able to... Oh,
[3096.28s -> 3101.80s]  my God. I had to use it. I had to do that. You guys all saw it. I had to do that. I might even
[3101.80s -> 3107.30s]  have to do it again. I'm gonna have to do it again. I'm gonna have to do it again. I'm probably
[3107.30s -> 3115.96s]  gonna have to do it again. Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to do it again. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No.
[3118.58s -> 3136.60s]  There's nowhere for me to go. Oh, there was nowhere for me to go. Oh, my God. Ugh. There was
[3136.60s -> 3145.29s]  literally nothing I could do right there besides just get hit a million times. Oh, now it is
[3145.29s -> 3156.23s]  definitely over. Oh, these... Come on. Okay, well, that's gonna be the end of this run. Hopefully,
[3156.23s -> 3161.43s]  you enjoyed this. Have fun in whatever you're gonna do and however you... What path you take
[3161.43s -> 3182.22s]  in your life. I'm silent. God. Ugh. That was the worst possible thing that could have happened.
[3183.62s -> 3193.56s]  Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. Nowhere to go. They were, like, engulfing me.
[3197.66s -> 3220.57s]  Ugh. Gosh, darn it. Well, that's... So now you know what's gonna happen is grandpa's gonna play as
[3220.57s -> 3224.01s]  question mark, question mark, question mark, and that's gonna be the end of the stream.
[3224.65s -> 3229.98s]  So I'm gonna go get grandpa. Grandpa can come in and he'll sit down. He'll talk about how he loves
[3229.98s -> 3238.44s]  this game and we'll see what happens. Hey, grandpa. Hey, you gotta get down here. You gotta play Binding
[3238.44s -> 3247.70s]  of Isaac right now. No, come... Yeah, come down. You're scaring the dog. Just come down. Okay,
[3247.70s -> 3253.90s]  let me just get over here. What the hell is this game? What game is this? Binding of Isaac.
[3254.62s -> 3260.49s]  What's that? Just play it. Just sit down and play. Okay, I'll sit down right here. There we go.
[3261.75s -> 3272.30s]  Okay. Hello. Let's play Binding of Isaac. What? Did I just eat shit? What the hell was that?
[3273.91s -> 3280.97s]  All right, so what are the controls in this game? Up, down, left, right. Okay, so here we go. Up,
[3280.97s -> 3292.62s]  down, left, right. Okay, good. Let's go this way. What's this? That's a spider. This game is stupid.
[3293.58s -> 3299.18s]  What a dumb game. So, you know what? You just killed spiders and that's it. This is stupid.
[3300.06s -> 3306.01s]  Why would you ever play this game? Okay, let's keep going. What's that? What the hell?
[3306.89s -> 3315.45s]  What? Oh, that hurts you. Oh, am I gonna like die? Let's just go. Okay, I'm gonna beat this
[3315.45s -> 3320.65s]  entire game right now. And let's go. Let's go down. Okay, we're gonna go down here.
[3321.88s -> 3326.12s]  Okay, so look, I'm driving like a farm right here. A pet spiders. Okay, hey spiders.
[3326.68s -> 3331.80s]  So today, we're gonna, I'm gonna feed you some little bugs and you're gonna eat them.
[3332.86s -> 3339.43s]  Again, I'm gonna shoot that. So how do I, is this like a simulator? How do I get out of here?
[3340.07s -> 3344.36s]  Oh, one of them escaped. One of the bugs escaped. One of the bugs fucking escaped.
[3345.94s -> 3353.35s]  That means you die, by the way. If you escape the hole, that means you die, you bastard. See,
[3353.35s -> 3359.80s]  these guys are locked in here forever. Can you get out now? Come on, try to get down now.
[3361.78s -> 3364.98s]  You're not getting anywhere. I'm gonna shoot the shit out of you. You can't even do it.
[3365.62s -> 3370.49s]  That's it, I got the key. Gonna go in the golden room, the golden palace,
[3371.59s -> 3379.62s]  and pick up the lazy beam. What? What does this do? Does this just shoot right through people?
[3380.34s -> 3393.86s]  So what's this button do? Oh, yeah, yeah. Ew. This game is gross. No, I take money. I love the
[3393.86s -> 3400.97s]  money. I absolutely love money. It's the best thing in the world. Whoa, that was an explosion.
[3401.93s -> 3410.31s]  We're going down to this room. Okay. Did I miss anything? Do I have to go back up here
[3410.31s -> 3418.14s]  or southward? What the hell is this? What is this? Do I go this? Oh my god, this guy. What is with
[3418.14s -> 3423.03s]  this guy? Can I help you? I'm gonna get him down. I gotta get him down off that rope. He's gonna die.
[3423.91s -> 3434.62s]  Oh, whatever. Screw you. Let's go down here. And this is the room I need to go in, right?
[3436.18s -> 3444.58s]  Oh, I have to fight this little worm. So what, do I just... Okay, so how many lives do I get?
[3446.50s -> 3449.86s]  What, I get like 10 lives, right? Like two, at least two or three lives, right?
[3452.31s -> 3462.14s]  What is... Do I have to start this all over again? You don't get lives in this game,
[3462.14s -> 3469.99s]  is that what you're trying to tell me right now? How come I don't have... This is the stupidest
[3469.99s -> 3476.38s]  game I've ever played. Why would you... This is the dumbest... You know what? I'm not gonna do
[3476.38s -> 3481.66s]  anything. I'm going right back to that same boss. That worm son of a bitch is going down right now.
[3481.66s -> 3491.48s]  Hey, worm! He's a different guy. Why is he... Where's the worm? The worm would look a lot easier
[3491.48s -> 3499.59s]  than this guy. What is... Is this whole game just like randomly generated? This is stupid.
[3500.39s -> 3505.06s]  I'm gonna like punch him in the face. I'll punch you! I'm gonna punch you right in your face.
[3505.06s -> 3508.82s]  You see, that's how you do it. That's a pro tip right there. See all those bugs that were around
[3508.82s -> 3513.06s]  him? They're not there anymore, are they? See, I'll do it again. Get rid of all the stupid goddamn
[3513.06s -> 3517.54s]  bugs. And that's how you win. That's how you beat this. And then you poo on them too. And that's
[3517.54s -> 3531.11s]  how you get the most massive points. Concentrate. Concentrate. Need to concentrate! Oh, I don't have
[3531.11s -> 3537.26s]  enough life to do the bug move again. I don't have enough life to do the bug move. And you know what?
[3537.58s -> 3542.38s]  He's almost dead. I'm gonna beat the game. I just beat the game. I just beat the game.
[3544.10s -> 3553.85s]  I just beat the game. This game's supposed to be hard. We're doing it again. We're going to do it
[3553.85s -> 3569.14s]  again. Go. Get out of my way. Get out of my way. This game is stupid. See you later. If you play
[3569.14s -> 3575.14s]  that game, you're a son of a bitch in my opinion. And we're not friends anymore. So I'm getting out
[3575.14s -> 3594.84s]  of here. Talk to you guys later. Hello? You see, did he die? What happened? Oh, I gotta put these
[3594.84s -> 3605.34s]  headphones back in. I mean, he still has a heart left. Not like he didn't die completely. Why is
[3605.34s -> 3616.04s]  he playing as this guy, by the way? All right. Oh, let's salvage the grandpa run. It's gonna be
[3616.04s -> 3632.47s]  impossible. Oh, poor grandpa. Don't worry, he'll get over it. Grandpa rages all the time. He'll get
[3632.47s -> 3644.76s]  over it. Ten bombs. And he died three times. Make it four, because I'm probably not going to make
[3644.76s -> 3653.72s]  it out of this room. Nope. Oh, there's no way. There's no way. Like, there's not a chance.
[3653.72s -> 3674.71s]  That's it right there. Well, that's gonna wrap it up, guys. Thanks everybody so much for coming.
[3674.71s -> 3680.30s]  This will all be on YouTube in the next, like, half an hour or so. So if you missed it from the
[3680.30s -> 3686.06s]  beginning, didn't really do any good runs, unfortunately. It wasn't a good night for Isaac.
[3687.42s -> 3691.90s]  But that's okay. Had fun, regardless. So thanks everybody again for coming so much. You guys all
[3691.90s -> 3701.26s]  rock and roll. And I will see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody. And let's end the stream.
[3704.23s -> 3710.47s]  Oh, and grandpa just says goodbye, too, and that he loves you all. Right, grandpa? Oh, he's coming
[3710.47s -> 3718.86s]  in here. Hold on. Grandpa, get in. You need to apologize to these people. Apologize to anybody.
[3720.97s -> 3729.45s]  Okay, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You know, rage takes over us all. And the game was just a little
[3729.45s -> 3739.93s]  too hard. But I love everybody. I hope you guys have a fantastic Sunday and love grandpa. And
[3739.93s -> 3746.26s]  goodbye. That's the end. Bye. Now, we're gonna eat in like 10 minutes. You gotta come up here,
[3746.26s -> 3750.74s]  Jeremy. Come on, let's go. And bring your dog, too. I'm gonna feed him.
[3753.02s -> 3760.44s]  All right. See you later. So that's gonna be the end, guys. Thanks a lot for watching. I really
[3760.44s -> 3763.88s]  do appreciate it. And of course, again, take care, everybody.
