[4.54s -> 15.02s]  Hey. Oh, good afternoon. How are you? How have you been? Good. Good. Excellent. It's very good to
[15.02s -> 23.59s]  hear. Today's a very special day. Today, we're going to be doing bro versus bro with Ludwig.
[26.68s -> 34.73s]  Yes, I'm very aware of our previous bets that we had. Sure those are going to be addressed on
[34.73s -> 46.41s]  camera. It'll be a fun day after that, after bro versus bro. You need to do a tweet? I will.
[47.21s -> 55.18s]  We're going to jump back into Elden Ring. I don't think this is going to take more than
[55.98s -> 62.12s]  two hours. So right when we say goodbye to Ludwig, we're going to hop into Elden Ring
[64.31s -> 71.40s]  and go for it. See if I can get to the end. He's addicted. I want to play it.
[72.28s -> 79.74s]  I got to call Ludwig by the way. Just give him a buzz in a second here.
[80.70s -> 90.18s]  One sec. Bro versus bro. You know, the competition between two bros.
[90.98s -> 100.97s]  We each pick a few games that we know that we're pretty good at or activities and we compete.
[101.69s -> 108.01s]  Whoever wins has to tweet themselves out in a in a mega milk shirt, right?
[108.97s -> 117.94s]  Oh, let me tell you something. From now on, bets are going to be very, very like benign and boring.
[119.45s -> 124.97s]  No more like, oh, you're gonna take your shirt off and drink milk upside down while you shit
[124.97s -> 129.58s]  your pants and tweet it. No, no, no, no, no, no. How about like, I don't know. How about like,
[129.58s -> 141.05s]  donate to church? How about like, hold a note for five seconds? That's like such a, no,
[141.05s -> 147.98s]  it can't be like that. It can't be like, that's like Nickelodeon. How long can you hold the note
[147.98s -> 161.37s]  for? Like, oh wow, you did it for five seconds. That was worth it. Fuck church. I just, I'm not
[161.37s -> 169.62s]  saying donate to church. I'm just saying like just, I use a random noun, okay? That was the
[169.62s -> 175.90s]  first noun that popped up in my head. I haven't been to church in probably like fucking 15 years
[175.90s -> 187.32s]  or something, guys. I don't know. A heretic. Which way do you want it? Religious streamer or
[187.32s -> 196.26s]  not religious streamer, huh? Let me tell you something. Aliens dropped us off. Aliens dropped
[196.26s -> 201.14s]  us off in a fucking care package here, okay? Sorry to blow everybody's, blow everybody's mind
[201.14s -> 223.19s]  here on this. Let's see what Ludwig has to say about that. You good? Heretic. I don't know. Who
[223.19s -> 233.82s]  knows? Do you don't know? Nobody knows anything. We could be amorphous blobs that evolved or some
[233.82s -> 247.08s]  alien could have shot a fucking cannon out into the galaxy and we just ended up here. Start your
[247.08s -> 270.01s]  stream. No, you start your religion. I don't know why I said start your stream. Are you Amish? What
[270.01s -> 273.85s]  does Amish have to, wait, what are you talking about? What does Amish have to do with that?
[276.76s -> 283.98s]  Amish people don't believe that aliens shot us out of a cannon. Why are you saying Amish?
[297.16s -> 312.01s]  He's streaming from rocks and twigs. I am not, actually. You're an alien? I don't know what the
[312.01s -> 324.92s]  hell we are. Millions of years of cells that have evolved. But why? You know, okay, we're getting
[324.92s -> 332.41s]  way too into this now. Let's bro versus bro with Ludwig, right? We don't have to ask the why.
[332.41s -> 339.21s]  We don't start a bro versus bro stream where I start asking questions about humanity and why we're
[339.21s -> 346.60s]  here. Maybe, well, should we throw Ludwig a curve ball? Right when he answers the phone. Why are we
[346.60s -> 362.23s]  here? He says. Why are we here? Ludwig. You know Ludwig. He'll be like, oh, play bro versus bro,
[362.23s -> 375.22s]  of course. And then he'll go and do the intro. God damn, is it a good intro? That's the thing.
[375.22s -> 383.93s]  A lot of people, you don't understand. A good intro is a huge deal. If you got a catchy intro
[383.93s -> 390.65s]  on YouTube, huge fucking deal. Guaranteed, guaranteed success. For instance, I'll give you
[390.65s -> 397.70s]  an example. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Team Fortress 2. My name is, I don't even know,
[397.70s -> 406.73s]  I can't even do my own intro. What is it? Hello, ladies and, what is it? No, no, no, no, no. I've
[406.73s -> 411.51s]  heard JermaCraft so many times. Hey, what's going on? Hey, I got it, I got it. Hey, what's going on,
[411.51s -> 423.70s]  buddy? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary. I would, right? You know what I'm
[423.70s -> 434.49s]  saying? He never left. He's still got it. It's so weird to think that that was still that long ago.
[437.05s -> 441.37s]  It's weird because that feels so long ago, but it feels like it was a week ago at the same time.
[443.48s -> 454.92s]  When I think back to when I was 25, I was like 24, 25. I feel like I'm so, like it's so long ago.
[464.12s -> 477.91s]  Yeah, Team Fortress 2. All right, I think we are. I didn't even tweet. Fuck, did I? No, I didn't. Hold
[477.91s -> 497.26s]  on. Let me tweet. I'm going to say, bro versus bro. Bro versus bro. Happening now. Bro versus
[497.26s -> 502.22s]  should it be bro versus bro versus Ludwig? No, that makes it sound like there's three people.
[509.43s -> 517.48s]  You're pretending to be young? I don't think so. I think you guys call me out on old
[518.52s -> 524.71s]  dated shit that I say all the time. I get question marks for references on TV shows that are like
[525.67s -> 531.51s]  six or seven plus years old. I'm not talking 30 years ago. We're talking like references that
[531.51s -> 543.69s]  are like five to 10 years ago. That's how I know I'm old. Yeah, I mean, I made an Andy Griffith
[543.69s -> 550.86s]  reference and nobody got that, which was annoying. That wasn't that long ago. That was like 70 or 80
[550.86s -> 562.20s]  years ago. All right, bro versus bro against Ludwig. No, that makes it sound like it's a tag team
[562.20s -> 571.14s]  against Ludwig. How do I say this? With Ludwig. No, that makes it sound like that Ludwig is like
[571.14s -> 576.86s]  an accessory to that stream. Not like it's not me versus... How do I say this? Featuring.
[578.76s -> 585.61s]  How about starring? Starring is kind of better, isn't it? Bro versus bro. Starring Ludwig.
[587.29s -> 601.10s]  That's so... That's so boring. With special... No, I'm the guest today. This is Ludwig's bro versus
[601.10s -> 606.90s]  bro. I'm a participant. How about bro versus bro? Let's go. That's easy. Okay, that's fine.
[607.78s -> 625.64s]  And I'm gonna add Ludwig. Yeah, that's fine. And remember, it's on dwitch.tv. Ludwig's currently
[625.64s -> 631.69s]  trying to set up one of the games that we're gonna play. I'm just gonna chill for a little bit.
[631.69s -> 639.30s]  Don't worry, today's gonna be a long one. Like I said, after we are done with bro versus bro,
[639.30s -> 645.18s]  I'm gonna go into Elden Ring. It'll be a long one. I don't know if it's gonna be too long,
[645.18s -> 651.62s]  but it'll be long enough. Okay, there we go. Yeah, there. That's a good tweet.
[653.74s -> 662.30s]  How the heck are you, huh? How are you? Yeah, so I think this is gonna work. Like I said,
[662.30s -> 667.88s]  we both picked three games, right? So we both have three games that we have chosen.
[669.90s -> 676.17s]  I can tell you my games. And it's depending on if Ludwig can get one to work. We might have to
[676.17s -> 684.68s]  pivot to something else. One of the neutral games. Should I leak it? Did he leak it? Did he already
[684.68s -> 695.22s]  talk about it? He didn't. All right. No, no. He didn't? Okay. He did. He already leaked it. He
[695.22s -> 708.07s]  leaked it? Okay. Well, if he leaked it, then whatever. We can just talk about it. He said
[708.07s -> 717.38s]  house flipper and battleship. Yeah, we were trying to figure out how to do house flipper competition.
[718.02s -> 724.02s]  And I was thinking is we both have to pick the same small house and flip it in like 10,
[724.02s -> 729.64s]  like 15 minutes. And whoever has the cooler house wins. I don't even know how we would
[729.64s -> 733.32s]  vote on that, though. Do we just do we just look like do a walkthrough of each other's houses and
[733.32s -> 740.82s]  just be like, Yeah, dude, you won't have it has more sale price. That's true. But the problem with
[740.82s -> 748.30s]  sale price and house flippers, it feels really random. It feels incredibly random. So it could
[748.30s -> 762.89s]  be I'm not sure you need a neutral party to come in. We have I wonder if we can we get a neutral
[762.89s -> 770.65s]  party to look every kind of funny. I have another couple games too. And one of them, by the way.
[771.29s -> 779.51s]  Oh, I am I'm locked in to be the victor. Like, it's almost guaranteed. I know this because Ludwig
[779.51s -> 786.06s]  didn't even know what this game was until three days ago. I've got like a decade of experience
[786.06s -> 797.06s]  in this game. He didn't even know what the game was. 48 hours ago. It's over on that one. Okay,
[797.06s -> 816.90s]  that's it. I'm just I picked that one to make sure that I could at least win one game among us. Why
[816.90s -> 825.14s]  would I play? I have no experience in among us. Why would I play among us? And then I got another
[825.14s -> 831.24s]  one that I have heard. I've heard that he's pretty good at. But I don't know. I don't know
[831.24s -> 837.93s]  in the scenario that he'll be put in if he'll be a good if he's gonna be all right. I have a lot
[837.93s -> 851.53s]  of experience with this particular thing too. We need a face cam. Oh, there'll be a face cam today.
[851.53s -> 864.41s]  Oh, yeah. You betcha. They say you betcha. Let's turn the intro music down. That's better.
[864.49s -> 874.71s]  So just chilling. Oh, hold on. Hold on. I'm getting a phone call. Hello. Hello,
[874.71s -> 881.59s]  Jerma. Hi. How are you? Doing quite well. In fact, good. Good. Did you uh, did you do all
[881.59s -> 887.64s]  you did you get? Is it settled? Settled a while ago. Oh, settled. Okay. Something else come up.
[887.64s -> 890.12s]  Yeah, I figured that out. Oh, all right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right.
[891.29s -> 895.61s]  Should be all set. Should be all set to do any house flipping at all.
[895.61s -> 902.74s]  Oh, so did you leak what we're doing? No, no, I meant that. No, I meant house flipping like
[902.74s -> 908.74s]  generally like flipping things in your life. Mixing things up. Oh, I leaked. Okay.
[911.54s -> 916.90s]  Because I think maybe I like I love breadcrumbs, you know, people got there. Yeah. All right. Yeah,
[916.90s -> 920.26s]  let's leak away. I don't I don't think I've said all the games. You want to leak?
[920.26s -> 927.06s]  Yeah, no, I haven't. You go ahead and leak. Okay, guys, this is this is the surprise.
[927.78s -> 932.98s]  We're playing bro versus bro with with several games. Jerma, there's four. There's four. You
[932.98s -> 937.62s]  know this, right? You know how it works out. There's four. What's the word games that we're
[937.62s -> 946.07s]  both good at neutral? What are the neutral games? Well, one is one that you I want to say invented.
[946.87s -> 952.47s]  Really Hasbro's battleship. That's the one I know that one. Amen. Amen. You made that game.
[953.51s -> 956.95s]  That's always the starter for broke verse bro. I just I try to keep it alive.
[958.95s -> 964.23s]  And then the other neutral games are rock paper scissors. Oh, shit.
[967.27s -> 971.99s]  That one. That one gave you the oh shit. I mean, that's I'm I'm actually kind of nervous about
[971.99s -> 976.63s]  that one. I feel like that either stuff. Okay. Yeah. I guess, you know, you're right. Rock does
[976.63s -> 981.27s]  beat scissors. That gets stressful. Because it's so it's so easy to lose or win that game.
[981.27s -> 985.67s]  Yeah, because I mean, you know, but I think you have a good chance at all these.
[985.67s -> 991.66s]  Next one is connect for neutral game. Okay. Why are you why are you love you? It sounds like
[991.66s -> 996.22s]  you have a history we can report. No, it's just I I'm glad that these are this simple.
[997.02s -> 1000.06s]  Because I was concerned to be like, oh, yeah, we're gonna hop into a fortnight. It's gonna be
[1000.06s -> 1007.61s]  a one v one. Oh, yeah. No items, you know, just absolutely imbalanced and just destroy you and
[1007.85s -> 1013.29s]  games you've never played. Yeah. Yeah, I tried to make it balanced because I realized that you
[1013.29s -> 1019.21s]  haven't played many games on stream that came out after 1999. That's very true. So So, you know,
[1020.73s -> 1024.81s]  and by the way, the last like, whole month, I've only played Elden Ring. It's the only game I play.
[1025.53s -> 1030.01s]  Yeah. Well, in the last neutral one is, of course, getting over it by Bennett body.
[1031.22s -> 1035.62s]  And how long do you how long each one of these games gonna take? We're doing like 15 to 20
[1035.62s -> 1041.30s]  minutes. 30 minutes. What's your time frame? Usually. So it's we just play each game and it
[1041.30s -> 1045.94s]  takes like about like Battleship's just the best of one takes about like 20 minutes. Connect four
[1045.94s -> 1049.54s]  is like maybe a best of three. It takes like five, 10 minutes. Rock, paper, scissors shoots
[1049.54s -> 1053.62s]  like a couple minutes. So it depends on the game and getting over. It's about six to 12 hours.
[1054.98s -> 1058.74s]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, the good news is I'm actually a pro speed runner at it and I have a five minute
[1058.74s -> 1065.14s]  time. But I think it's neutral. Then you seem like you're talent neutral because you have a great
[1065.14s -> 1070.50s]  way of handling anger. And I think that's why this is a good game that you might have a good
[1070.50s -> 1076.52s]  chance in. You know what? OK, I don't think that's I don't think that's a neutral experience. Sensing
[1076.52s -> 1082.44s]  a little tension. Let's let's pivot. OK, we'll pivot to something more balanced. How about just
[1082.44s -> 1091.13s]  reaction speed? That works because I mean, one of the games that I picked is, of course, like speed.
[1092.41s -> 1097.85s]  Is that what? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Click speed. OK. How fast you can click your mouse in 10 seconds. I
[1097.85s -> 1102.97s]  think I got you on that one. I think I do. Yeah. No, I do. You have history in that, like,
[1102.97s -> 1110.15s]  like clicking fast. Oh, yeah. And I know you do, too. A light amount. A light. This is with the
[1110.15s -> 1114.31s]  mouse, though, right? This is with a mouse. This is not with a controller. Yeah. Changes it a bit.
[1114.31s -> 1118.87s]  That changes it a bit. It does. The dynamic changes when you have to have a hand on your desk.
[1119.75s -> 1125.27s]  Wait, is that so I can't lift the mouse? No, you cannot hold the mouse in your hand and cradle it
[1125.27s -> 1128.55s]  like a baby and sit there like that. No, it's got to be. You can use two hands.
[1129.67s -> 1135.11s]  You can't. The mouse needs to be on your desk. OK, and it's just left clicking, right? Yes. Left
[1135.11s -> 1139.59s]  clicking. OK, just clip. OK. All right. All right. Wait, everyone in my chat saying I'm going to get
[1139.59s -> 1145.67s]  fucking destroyed. I'm going to get destroyed. Oh, no. I when you told me this game, I was excited
[1145.67s -> 1150.31s]  for you because I knew you'd do really well. I mean, I'm I could I'm like about 14 plus 15
[1150.31s -> 1155.67s]  clicks a second. Like I'm I'm an absolute maniac at that. Yeah, I'm I'm people say I'm fucked.
[1155.67s -> 1161.11s]  Wow. Fifteen. That's really good. That's and that's because it's a lot. It's a lot of clicks in a
[1161.11s -> 1168.65s]  second. But it sounds so confident, like way too confident. I think 15 is impressive. I think that
[1168.65s -> 1177.19s]  beats most children. And yeah, but you can't hold it in your arms and like it's got to be on the
[1177.19s -> 1185.78s]  table. Probably most like teachers would lose to you in this 1v1. All right. All right. I'm ready.
[1185.78s -> 1189.22s]  I'm ready. I'm ready to compete. I'm ready to compete. Yeah. Great. Great. And you have a couple
[1189.22s -> 1193.62s]  more games. Do you want to reveal them as we go or do you want to just fucking go now? I hope
[1193.62s -> 1197.14s]  hopefully the RNG works in my favorite battleship because I ain't going to win any of these.
[1197.70s -> 1203.70s]  Well, the good news is it's first to five. So you can't just win off your own games or even like
[1203.70s -> 1207.94s]  four games. You got to win five. So we have to win some of the neutrals. OK, that sounds good.
[1208.66s -> 1212.90s]  We can reveal the games as we go. Let's just kick off with a bit of battleship. Let's do battleship.
[1212.90s -> 1218.55s]  So I do what? Do I have to be online on Steam for this? Oh, yeah, you do. OK, that's easy.
[1218.55s -> 1223.96s]  It's actually phenomenal because I just went offline. Yeah, I start every single day and offline.
[1224.52s -> 1228.60s]  Wait, why? I don't know. I just like, I just always want to be offline. People give me shit
[1228.60s -> 1233.24s]  for this all the time. You know that? I'm never online. I'm never online on Discord. I'm never
[1233.24s -> 1238.60s]  online on Battle.net. I'm never online on Steam. Always permanently offline. Permanently. I switch
[1238.60s -> 1243.98s]  to being permanently offline in Discord. Really? Well, people would judge me like I'd come to
[1243.98s -> 1248.95s]  stream the day after and they'd be like, oh, wow, Ludwig, three hours last night playing Jump King.
[1248.95s -> 1254.95s]  You know, I'd be like, oh, yeah, I don't. Yeah, I don't want people to see my like my history of
[1254.95s -> 1260.63s]  me playing like five hundred hours of Lost Ark. No, no, don't tell me. That's a meme, right?
[1261.19s -> 1264.87s]  It is a meme, but I'm just saying. All right. All right. I'd be concerned for you.
[1265.83s -> 1268.81s]  I'm just. Is there a way to leak it to just each other?
[1270.57s -> 1276.01s]  What? Your history? Yeah, like can you can you be offline but like show it to friends on Steam?
[1276.01s -> 1284.09s]  Maybe. I think so. I don't know. I dude, I I like privated my Steam profile like a half decade ago
[1284.09s -> 1287.21s]  and I don't even know how to turn it off. I have no idea how to even turn it back on.
[1287.85s -> 1293.21s]  Oh, I have no fucking idea. I almost forgot. We have to we have to figure out what we're playing
[1293.21s -> 1299.64s]  for. Yeah. Well, OK, so this is where it gets weird because we had a competition a long time ago
[1300.36s -> 1305.26s]  and you won and I had to do a series of things that never happened.
[1306.78s -> 1312.78s]  I can't. It was like a cartoon list of things. Yeah, it was. It was like a Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck
[1312.78s -> 1317.34s]  cartoon list of weird shit that I had to do. Uh huh. One of them was to take like a picture.
[1318.06s -> 1324.70s]  That's like a fucking room with like a Megamilk shirt on with like delivering milk. Yeah, I think
[1324.70s -> 1329.34s]  you need to like get milked and then deliver the milk in a milk costume and then also go to like
[1329.34s -> 1335.26s]  a casino and wager like five hundred dollars. Dude, it was fifteen. It was fifteen hundred dollars.
[1335.26s -> 1340.22s]  It was. Let's just say it was five hundred. That's easy. Yeah, it was a lot. It was a lot.
[1341.50s -> 1346.06s]  How do I verify that you can't like videotape in a casino? I couldn't have like how do I verify
[1346.06s -> 1351.24s]  you would have to like be there physically to like. Yeah, I think this is this. OK, I look,
[1351.24s -> 1356.20s]  I will. I will because that's in a video, right guy. There's evidence of the cartoon list.
[1356.20s -> 1362.36s]  I'll just eventually go to you and then bring all the effects and then I can verify it like a like
[1362.36s -> 1370.60s]  a Guinness Book of World Records judge. So if you win today, you it's going to be like the
[1371.40s -> 1375.56s]  in like those Disney movies where the guy lifts up the parchment and the thing hits the floor
[1375.56s -> 1379.56s]  and he's like, so this is what you need to do today. It's got like what are you going to have
[1379.56s -> 1385.88s]  to do? What else could you have me possibly do? I think at a certain point, it's just I just go
[1385.88s -> 1390.44s]  over to you and I just have a week where I just I get my way. I just want my like string key for
[1390.44s -> 1395.80s]  like two days or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're getting there. We're getting there. You know,
[1398.54s -> 1403.59s]  take my string key for one hour. Maybe we keep this one simple then, right? That it's not it
[1403.59s -> 1408.22s]  doesn't add to the list. It's just something it's something nice, but like concrete. Yeah,
[1408.22s -> 1419.29s]  like like donating to your local church. I already do that so much. You should have seen my face. I
[1419.29s -> 1426.90s]  was smiling ear to ear. That was a joke for my chat that they're they all hate me for donating to
[1426.90s -> 1430.82s]  your local church. No, because we went back and forth about how I was like, let's make it easy.
[1430.82s -> 1435.14s]  Like I don't want to like stand on my head and drink milk with like my ass cheeks showing like
[1435.22s -> 1438.58s]  let you say, oh, like donate to something. And I was like, donate to, I don't know,
[1438.58s -> 1441.22s]  like church and people like church. What the fuck are you talking about?
[1441.22s -> 1447.10s]  Is that what you expect from me? Is it like something that depraved to stand on your head
[1447.10s -> 1453.24s]  and then drink like ass drink milk? Well, I mean, it wasn't one of the original things that I was
[1453.24s -> 1457.72s]  up to show up in like a sexy maid outfit and deliver milk to your house. Like that. That's a
[1457.72s -> 1462.84s]  little different. Now you're conflating the two. You're bloviating. That one's normal. That's like
[1462.84s -> 1467.42s]  almost it's like a common request from people these days. I've been asked to do that a lot.
[1467.42s -> 1471.10s]  I can't believe you haven't been boofing milk is obviously worse than that. Jesus Christ.
[1472.30s -> 1478.15s]  All right. I believe I am on the steam now. Should I join or what are you guys talking about?
[1478.15s -> 1483.99s]  This is bro versus bro, man. Just, just bro is being bros. All right. Talking about talking,
[1483.99s -> 1487.03s]  talking about maids and milk. Okay. What do you want, man? What are bros supposed to talk
[1487.03s -> 1491.34s]  about these days? All right. So join. Do you want to host it or should I host? Yeah. Yeah,
[1491.74s -> 1497.96s]  I'll send you. Do you want to play on a fancy board or a simple board? That's up to you. I
[1497.96s -> 1501.80s]  usually let the guests decide, but let's do it. Let's cause this is just best of one, right? We're
[1501.80s -> 1506.76s]  just playing this. Yes. Just one. Let's do fancy. Let's go fancy. Okay. All right. I'm going to do
[1506.76s -> 1513.27s]  hole in the middle. Oh, don't. Yeah. It sounds like you immediately hated that. Cause that's the one
[1513.27s -> 1517.03s]  you, you kicked my ass on that one before. Did I? Yeah, it was bad. I think I kicked your ass on
[1517.03s -> 1521.99s]  them. I don't mean to be Rudy. I kicked your ass on every single one of them. Well, Ludwig, this
[1521.99s -> 1526.87s]  rude. And then there's factual. So, you know, you can go ahead and be factual with you. All right.
[1526.87s -> 1530.47s]  Great. Great. Great. Great. Okay. So play with friends. I'm going to join game. I'm not showing
[1530.47s -> 1538.55s]  not leaking an old wager. I used to do is that the loser would give the winner a pair of their shoes.
[1538.55s -> 1545.98s]  Okay. What's I, what size are you? 11. I'm like 10. It wasn't to wear as more so for like,
[1545.98s -> 1552.86s]  that's not like I needed it. I don't know. I had a dream where it's like pink slips and I'd
[1552.86s -> 1558.79s]  hang them up on the rafters and it would just be all like the carcasses of the foes I've slain.
[1558.79s -> 1561.91s]  I thought it was just like, dude, let me take a look at your like shoe collection and see which
[1561.91s -> 1566.07s]  good, what do you got? You got anything cool? And by the way, I don't. Yeah. They're like,
[1566.07s -> 1571.91s]  like bands or like slip ons usually, right? You don't. Ludwig, five out of the six pairs
[1571.91s -> 1577.91s]  of shoes that I have are house flippers, like house flip slippers. They're house slippers,
[1577.99s -> 1585.59s]  house flippers. They're fucking very basic. I don't have shoes, man. I really don't. I have
[1585.59s -> 1592.02s]  like one pair of sneakers. I have about eight pairs of Crocs and that's about it. Yeah. That's
[1592.02s -> 1599.83s]  right. You do have a lot of Crocs. All right. What's the code? Do you want to? Okay. Now I'm
[1599.83s -> 1606.58s]  not going to leak now. Okay. Not leaking. You can show the screen now. Yeah. All right. I think
[1606.58s -> 1611.75s]  this is a good setup. Is there a, is there a champ? Do you want to neutral a champ or do you
[1611.75s -> 1617.03s]  want to go or separate ways? No, I like this guy. I like this Giuseppe. He's really good. Giuseppe.
[1617.03s -> 1622.68s]  Yeah. Oh yeah. Do you mind if I go William Cars like, or do you want me to go Giuseppe too? No,
[1622.68s -> 1626.84s]  no. Well, however, I mean, this is a competition, so you can do what you need to do. I'm just asking
[1626.84s -> 1635.88s]  questions out here. I'm prepared. Actually really not at all, but how do you get prepared for
[1635.88s -> 1641.08s]  battleship? You just do it. Yeah. You just, you believe you just play. Well, I actually open up
[1641.08s -> 1646.28s]  to a shot TV and get, you know, just, oh, you come over here and you take a look, just take a peek.
[1646.28s -> 1650.92s]  I mean, how do you think I want so much from you last time? Yeah. I know. You know, I think there
[1650.92s -> 1657.14s]  needs to be a verifying, uh, oh, by the way, uh, speaking of verifying house flipper, do we have a
[1657.14s -> 1663.64s]  neutral third party? Completely neutral party. Absolutely. We do. Cause if we pick a house,
[1664.36s -> 1669.24s]  right? Right. Just like, like one of the smaller houses, we got 20, 30 minutes, whatever to flip
[1669.24s -> 1676.47s]  it. Have a neutral third party come in. We'll do walkthroughs, a walkthrough, like real estate
[1676.47s -> 1683.98s]  style. And they decide who has the better house. Yeah. I think it's some fantastic idea. Okay.
[1683.98s -> 1688.70s]  I think, uh, I think I have a couple options we could do. It's a little biased. I was going to say
[1688.70s -> 1694.71s]  cutie. Cause she was an interior decorator. I think she, she wouldn't favor me or I could get,
[1694.71s -> 1700.31s]  yeah, I could find someone else. Maybe Connor. Yeah. Who would want to do it? Yeah. Uh, yeah,
[1700.31s -> 1705.77s]  I like that. It's a good idea. Yeah. That sounds fun. Cause then then it takes us out of it. It
[1705.77s -> 1710.97s]  takes Chad out of it. It's not like, oh, we do a poll. We have a third party come in and give us
[1710.97s -> 1717.13s]  the real opinion. The facts, nothing but the real HGTV style. All right. I got to place my ships.
[1717.13s -> 1722.71s]  I know I'm, I'm like stalling way too much right now. I'm focused. Cause you, you, you, you,
[1722.71s -> 1731.16s]  you have somewhere to, uh, you got a cutoff. I have a light cutoff. It's at like 6 37. All right. So
[1731.16s -> 1735.24s]  we, we should probably get my time. So I got, I got, I got a bit of time. I got a few hours.
[1735.24s -> 1745.11s]  You have experience playing this. I've, I've seen some of the, the experience you have. Oh yeah. I
[1745.11s -> 1752.98s]  get a little, I get a little involved. I know you, you never want to do that. I want to do that.
[1753.70s -> 1758.50s]  All right. I think this is good. This is terrible placement. This is not, this is not your bro
[1758.50s -> 1762.26s]  versus bro. When you do bro versus bro, when you do it, then you can put your play, you can play,
[1762.26s -> 1767.88s]  you can put your planes wherever you want. Okay. Amen. Tell them, tell them, Jerma. This is
[1767.88s -> 1771.88s]  terrible. I don't know. It can't be terrible at battleship. There's no such thing.
[1773.43s -> 1777.85s]  All right. I think I'm thinking this is pretty good. I'm going to go with this one.
[1777.85s -> 1791.02s]  This sucks. It's fine. Everyone's, why is everybody giving me so much shit with this?
[1791.02s -> 1798.74s]  It's just basic. I'm ready. It's basic. They're all in a row. That doesn't work anymore. It doesn't.
[1801.72s -> 1808.28s]  Ah, me to start. Uh huh. Start like I always do. Right. Yeah. Mine's mine. It's the mind meta.
[1808.68s -> 1826.97s]  Hmm. Hmm. It's a mind meta. Is there a game you've, uh, always been chastised to play on stream?
[1826.97s -> 1832.63s]  Uh, smite or smite because everybody hates it. They think it's funny that they hate it.
[1832.63s -> 1836.23s]  So, and they know that I'm going to get like fucking a hundred viewers playing it.
[1836.23s -> 1840.87s]  So they just like play it because they just want, I guess they just want me to fail for some reason.
[1840.87s -> 1847.54s]  Yeah. I have a similar thing with toon town. Oh, toon town. That's one that I've been looking at.
[1849.00s -> 1854.76s]  It's like recently. I like a year ago. Okay. Really only one. I got one in there.
[1855.48s -> 1864.89s]  How about the loser has to play that game? The loser of this whole thing has to play toon town.
[1864.89s -> 1879.16s]  Well, no, you'd have to play smite. Mine is toon town. Oh, you know. Okay. Just an hour or two.
[1879.16s -> 1884.20s]  Yeah. That sounds fun. Omega law. Yikes. That's people consider that to be one of my worst streams
[1884.20s -> 1890.94s]  I've ever done by the way. The smite smite one. Yeah. Were you just not feeling it that day or
[1891.02s -> 1897.03s]  Oh, did I not intern? Oh shit. No, I, no, it's just like, I just was terrible and I did viewer games
[1897.03s -> 1900.23s]  and there were people that played the game so much more than I do. And there's so much more
[1900.23s -> 1906.12s]  talented than I am. Um, and I kind of just walked out of spawn and died like 30 or 40 times.
[1907.40s -> 1912.71s]  Um, and I made this, I made this big elaborate thing, how much I played it.
[1912.71s -> 1916.87s]  Oh, you, you hyped yourself up. People are begging me not to play. They're in the chat right now.
[1916.87s -> 1923.16s]  Just freaking out. Oh, that's probably a, it's probably a good pick. I would say toon town is
[1923.16s -> 1929.38s]  cool though. No, it was genuinely everyone begged me to play, begged me to play. I boot up toon
[1929.38s -> 1935.94s]  town. I was averaging about a hundred viewers. I dropped to 15. I did the thing where I would look
[1935.94s -> 1944.38s]  at chat and I would go to read a message, but there were no messages updating a hundred to 15,
[1944.38s -> 1950.86s]  15 people, every, it was hundreds begging me to play for weeks. And I look over there's 15
[1950.86s -> 1955.58s]  people and the chat's not updating. I'm reading the same message. One guy said, why are you
[1955.58s -> 1959.58s]  keep looking over here? There's no new messages. Well, somebody, somebody said that somebody said
[1959.58s -> 1964.90s]  that to me in chat. Why are you looking over here, dude? Wow. That person, that's like an
[1964.90s -> 1971.16s]  ultimate burn. I was so, so hurtful because he was right. He was so incredibly right.
[1971.16s -> 1975.86s]  Yeah, but you have to, the rebuttal to that is what if somebody does, I don't want to miss it.
[1977.61s -> 1982.73s]  My rebuttal to that was, oh, you're right, man. And then quietly playing toon town for another
[1982.73s -> 1985.61s]  30 minutes before ending stream. I thought you were going to say like, you said,
[1985.61s -> 1990.41s]  fuck you. And you banned them. The only guy that's still there. I can't ban my one of 15
[1990.41s -> 1996.63s]  viewers. That's like 8%. I don't have, you, you would have, okay. You're talking about looking
[1996.63s -> 2003.26s]  over and you know, you don't not seeing anything like you would see the, like you banned that guy
[2003.26s -> 2009.64s]  message for a while. If you're playing toon town, right? Yeah. Like it'd be there for probably like
[2009.64s -> 2013.24s]  15 minutes and I would just look over and see it. I'd be like, I, you know, I'd prefer to be
[2013.24s -> 2020.39s]  chastised and look at nothing. Where are your boats? A bit of a quiet round to start off.
[2025.10s -> 2037.03s]  Honest to God, where are these? Does it make any sense? Well, you just scanned three. Somebody
[2037.03s -> 2042.15s]  said, how do you miss that much? Just land a shot because when you throw dice in the air,
[2042.15s -> 2047.35s]  sometimes you look at when the dice land, it could be anything. Hey man. They don't know about dice.
[2049.27s -> 2059.48s]  Oh, devious. Bingo. Come on. No. Oh, there we go. Lock. There we go. I thought it was the T shape.
[2059.48s -> 2066.46s]  I'm very happy about that one. All right. So you've got, what, what are your shapes?
[2067.02s -> 2072.71s]  Okay. They're on the right there. Yeah. So I mean, it's very, very likely. It's not likely at all.
[2072.71s -> 2080.09s]  Apparently I was, I mean, it's how unlikely is that I feel like it's as likely as any of the cardinal
[2080.09s -> 2089.99s]  directions, right? You put up a mind, Mandy, you changed bullshit. You asked me already getting
[2089.99s -> 2097.54s]  broke. It's pretty early to get that fraudster in a turbo. Ooh, you started off really strong,
[2097.54s -> 2106.55s]  but now it looks like I'm climbing. I'm really caught up with that. Ooh. Maybe try East or West.
[2107.27s -> 2117.77s]  Yeah. I mean, at this point, whatever it wasn't down. You have a lot of twos. Okay. Maybe if there
[2117.77s -> 2124.17s]  were three and you added a mine and you can't have a four shape. So it can't be all in the bottom
[2124.17s -> 2135.24s]  three. So it probably has to be on the right. Oopsie. Somebody made it. Oh, come on. Ooh. And
[2135.24s -> 2144.73s]  I get the confirmation. He's feeling himself. He's feeling himself. This is the worst case.
[2144.73s -> 2148.41s]  So, but that's not, that's not the two because it would have been sunk. So that's gotta be the
[2148.41s -> 2159.08s]  fleet. He thinks it's the fleet. I thought I really thought it was the fleet. That was if I'm really
[2159.08s -> 2170.17s]  honest with you, whatever, I'm fine. I'm ahead. And this is how I make my comeback. Ultimate
[2170.17s -> 2178.54s]  destruction. Oh, it's fucking dumb. Fucking stupid. Fucking game. Fucking game. Yeah. That's
[2178.54s -> 2183.26s]  fucking stupid. Yeah. Get the fuck out of here with that fucking stupid bullshit kid.
[2186.28s -> 2197.13s]  Your Boston's showing. So, oh, I wonder where he is. So that's, that's three in a row, which means
[2197.13s -> 2202.01s]  it has to be your gigantic L. Is it up or down? And by the way, if I get this right, you're taking
[2202.01s -> 2213.78s]  a big L here. Oh, that's a loss for all of you at home. What's going on? What have you done? What
[2213.78s -> 2221.11s]  is this? I don't, I hate when people do this because I'm too dumb to figure this out. I hate
[2221.11s -> 2229.43s]  when people do this. It's just a ship. I don't know. It's three. It's like two or three ships
[2229.43s -> 2235.51s]  together. Weirdly large ship. I know it's weirdly large, but it's one big ship. One, two, three.
[2238.41s -> 2248.10s]  God damn it. I hate this. I'll have to just, is it this way? No, that doesn't make any sense.
[2248.66s -> 2258.52s]  It's either. Okay. I'll come back to it. I'm going to come back to it.
[2260.23s -> 2267.85s]  You're just going to come back to it. Oh, yes. Come on. No, wait me. No, wait me. No, wait me. No,
[2267.85s -> 2277.67s]  wait me. Oh, sorry. Oh, come on. Do it again. No, I know it's not there. I am very smart.
[2277.83s -> 2284.98s]  Who says it like that? I am very smart. Oh shit. He got it. Right. We've tagged four of the five
[2284.98s -> 2292.55s]  ships. I don't know why I thought that said ship sucks. Oh, I got, I got to make something
[2292.55s -> 2297.99s]  happen here now. Four of the five ships. This one has to go to the left. I've been in a lot of
[2297.99s -> 2303.83s]  trouble now. I mean, there's a lot of trouble. You guys ready for smite Thursday? This one's
[2303.83s -> 2309.83s]  probably the long one. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the
[2309.83s -> 2316.52s]  right. This one's probably the long one. Yeah, he's going to go left. Damn it. No, he is not. Son of
[2316.52s -> 2326.41s]  a bitch. I got, okay. I got to get like all of your ships right now. And here's the thing though.
[2326.41s -> 2333.69s]  I've been holding on to it. I've got a super soaker. You understand? It doesn't sound as
[2333.69s -> 2338.41s]  threatening when you say super soaker. And I, I'm going to just pick the place that, you know what
[2338.41s -> 2345.32s]  I mean? We're going in the corner. All right. That's fine. All right. That's one of your takes
[2345.32s -> 2351.08s]  one down. This one takes one. I got a mind though. You did. Come on. Come on. Sorry. Good. Good. Good.
[2351.08s -> 2360.89s]  Good. All right. It's tough. It's tough. And by the way, uh, bingo, I'm doing it again. No. Yeah.
[2360.89s -> 2367.86s]  Fuck it. We're going over here. Well, you saved the two. Oh, you, I, you don't think I have a
[2367.86s -> 2377.14s]  strategy, a new strategy. I think I'm going right here or yeah. Yep. No. Yes. Yep. Right here. I
[2377.22s -> 2384.90s]  don't know. Right here. Right there. Right here. All right. All right. All right. Oh no. Okay.
[2384.90s -> 2398.94s]  All right. All right. Okay. Okay. This is not, this just became a video game. Okay. I have to
[2398.94s -> 2407.05s]  decide now with my slightly better than average orangutan brain where this is what you're doing
[2407.05s -> 2423.29s]  here. I think if I were to be smart about this, it has to be, uh, it has to be, uh, what the fuck
[2423.29s -> 2431.14s]  is this? This is, has to be your Tetris piece and your L, but what way is the L going this way?
[2432.81s -> 2440.92s]  I am very good at this. I know where you are now. And now I'm going to sink the other one too.
[2440.92s -> 2446.20s]  Now you're in deep shit because well, not quite because I, you could be another way here, but I'm
[2446.20s -> 2453.00s]  going to say you're over here and you are, and this is where it gets very heated because I know
[2453.00s -> 2469.43s]  you have a two right here somewhere. And ladies and gentlemen, we did it. There's no fucking way.
[2469.43s -> 2485.38s]  There's no way. There's no way. Oh, that's bad. That's not how you win these games. I don't think
[2486.26s -> 2498.42s]  the greatest mine I've ever seen both shots hit. Uh, but you don't know what you don't know where
[2498.42s -> 2504.31s]  this is though. I, it's not over. It's not over yet. You don't know where, which way the,
[2504.31s -> 2508.79s]  you don't know which way the penis is going. Okay. You don't, you don't, it could be going up.
[2511.00s -> 2518.12s]  I lost, didn't I? What the fuck? What happened? The only way you win is if I hit a mine and it hits
[2518.12s -> 2526.71s]  both of your remaining ships or my remaining ships, it's definitely just a T like you just made a
[2526.71s -> 2541.42s]  normal run of the mill T. It's very normal. You thought that's all I had. You already shot though.
[2541.42s -> 2558.58s]  You already shot. You already shot. Oh, I saved my bullets. God wants me in a mega milk shirt.
[2560.82s -> 2566.50s]  A lot of people do. He's looking down right now being like, no, no, no, I don't think so. No,
[2566.50s -> 2570.98s]  no, no. And he like shoots a fucking lightning beam out and like gives you the power to do that.
[2570.98s -> 2574.42s]  I got to see him in that mega milk shirt. He's got to be in that mega milk shirt. Otherwise,
[2574.42s -> 2579.24s]  you know, what's the point of me creating? It was all for you in a mega milk shirt.
[2580.97s -> 2587.40s]  Well, it is one on my favorite now. I had, I had that in the bag too. Like it's just,
[2587.40s -> 2591.64s]  that's just, you know, that's how the cards lay. You know, I think your one mistake was what was
[2591.64s -> 2596.71s]  that destroying all my ships, even though you knew where they were. Cause it gave me so many points.
[2598.12s -> 2607.54s]  Yeah. Yeah. It's a, whatever though. Hey, it's fine. What Oh, German, where would you like to take me?
[2609.13s -> 2616.02s]  Let's do, let's do the click speed. Okay. All right. All right. Damn it. I can't believe I
[2616.02s -> 2622.42s]  fucking lost that. Let's do click speed, click speed, click speed. It is. Uh, all right. Let's,
[2622.42s -> 2630.28s]  let's do this. Um, so how do you want to do this? You want, you want to do like you go and then I go
[2630.36s -> 2634.04s]  What do you want to do at the same time? Well, let's just do you go. I go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2634.04s -> 2639.29s]  Like one at a time. Okay. And maybe we'll do like a two run, three runs each, three runs each. Seems
[2639.29s -> 2644.70s]  fine. Or we could do three. You go, I go. That works too. So you want me to go first because
[2644.70s -> 2648.54s]  you're, you want to see what you got working up where, what you're working with here. It's your
[2648.54s -> 2654.06s]  game. You picked it. You go first and I'll go and it's best of three. So if you went around one,
[2654.06s -> 2660.86s]  et cetera, I'm going to pull up your stream and I'm going to, I'll mute and I'll let you just
[2660.86s -> 2680.94s]  be in your own thoughts. Okay. Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, one, two, one, two,
[2680.94s -> 2702.18s]  one, two, one, two. I got it. I still got it. Mouse is on the desk. All right. All right. All
[2702.18s -> 2717.64s]  right. That's 121 clicks in 10 seconds. That's 12.1 clicks per second. 121, 121. That's my number
[2717.64s -> 2728.70s]  to beat. Yep. I have to see what you're doing. Yeah. You can pull up the, uh, the old stream
[2728.70s -> 2735.70s]  there. It's a little hard to find. Let me get it. She's going to go to youtube.com forward slash
[2735.70s -> 2740.94s]  live forward slash streams forward slash now. If you blow this out of the water, I'm going to be
[2740.94s -> 2749.88s]  pissed. All right. I'm on your channel. There it is. I'm on your channel. There it is. Okay. Let's
[2749.88s -> 2760.33s]  see. Let's see what you got. Okay. Let's see. Let's see what you got on the table. Two hands.
[2760.33s -> 2784.12s]  Oh, you can, you can use as many hands as you want, but the mouse has to be on the table.
[2784.12s -> 2795.72s]  No shot. That's the three best of three. I just have to learn. I have to learn. I have to learn.
[2796.52s -> 2804.73s]  I'm not used to keeping it on the table. He's nerfing me. All right. It's you. It's back to you.
[2804.73s -> 2813.42s]  All right. Back to me. Back to me. All right. Here we go. Uh, you could, you, however you want
[2813.42s -> 2819.96s]  to do this, that's up to you. I just did. I did one, just one that whole time. Let's make this hard
[2819.96s -> 2842.28s]  for you. Here we go. Ah, that was a little lower than last time. I distracted you with noise. I
[2842.28s -> 2848.20s]  distracted him. I thought, I thought it'd work. I thought it'd work. That was one 19. Okay. One
[2848.20s -> 2852.60s]  19. So I thought, so I had to, I had to get at least one 20. You got to get at least one 20 to
[2852.60s -> 2861.06s]  win this one. I wish my mouse wouldn't move. I could just do this. If I could, I would be insane.
[2861.06s -> 2868.22s]  I would drop numbers that no one's ever seen before. I gotta go live. There we go. How do you
[2868.22s -> 2876.71s]  keep the mouse still? It's out. You don't want me to give you a tactic? Yeah. If you could. It's
[2876.71s -> 2884.14s]  no, that's the only game I'm going to win. No, you're not doing your feet. No,
[2884.14s -> 2889.50s]  you're not doing your feet, dude. There's nothing in the rules that says a dog can't play basketball.
[2890.14s -> 2897.42s]  Why do you look, why do you look huge? What's going on? Why do you look like half your body is
[2897.42s -> 2902.30s]  across the rest of the room? You look like you're sitting at the back wall and your feet are going
[2902.30s -> 2906.63s]  all the way over here. Why? What's going on with this perspective? This looks weird.
[2908.22s -> 2911.26s]  You're distracting me a lot. Do you have a fisheye lens?
[2915.10s -> 2920.02s]  What's going on with this camera? I just need to get two feet. All right, I'm ready.
[2920.74s -> 2937.13s]  It's not even registering. You look like, you look like you're typing up like a project.
[2938.33s -> 2946.39s]  I'm so frustrated. You look so tired from a full day like of like cramming for an exam.
[2947.11s -> 2953.19s]  You're just like leaning back like, fuck man, I don't want to. How many words is a 1200 word essay?
[2953.19s -> 2960.25s]  God damn it. I'm at 1100 words. I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.
[2965.78s -> 2973.08s]  Oh my God. All right. What was your technique? The technique is you brace with whatever your
[2973.08s -> 2980.09s]  non-dominant hand is and then you just spam with the other one. What do you, that's not a technique.
[2980.09s -> 2984.97s]  Yeah. No, you, I just asked you like how to do a five paragraph essay and you said you just sit
[2984.97s -> 2992.31s]  in front of the computer and you write. Yeah. What's the, what's the key? All right. The key is
[2993.56s -> 3002.68s]  just get, come on over to my stream. I'll show you. I'm there. Here's the key. Key is you are not
[3002.68s -> 3010.76s]  trying to click. You are trying to pulsate. Does that make sense to you? You're one finger,
[3010.76s -> 3022.94s]  Freddy. It's one finger, Freddy. And it's pulse like, and you pulse for instance,
[3022.94s -> 3042.73s]  let's go ahead and beat that last one. Here we go. All right. 12.3. You should see me with a
[3042.73s -> 3045.93s]  controller, man. You should see me with that. That's why I picked this in particular.
[3047.30s -> 3053.11s]  It was a demoralizing play. You're demoralizing me. I got to win at least one. All right. All
[3053.11s -> 3057.67s]  right. All right. Germa's on the board. Germa's on the board. It is what it is. You put your feet up.
[3058.31s -> 3064.55s]  It was like, you were like lounging on a boat. Like that was that. You want to go for one more?
[3064.55s -> 3071.27s]  Do you want to try it one more time? No, I really don't. I really don't. I thought that you had a
[3071.27s -> 3077.99s]  secret way to hold the mouse and you're using two hands and cause you kept saying as many hands as
[3077.99s -> 3085.51s]  you'd like. And so I thought there was a secret hold. Oh, I would outsmart you by using my feet
[3085.51s -> 3089.99s]  as the hold. I see. So you thought I was, I was just kind of messing with you like that.
[3089.99s -> 3096.81s]  There's a special way to do it. Yeah. Yeah, I did. I did think that I was deceived. Well,
[3096.81s -> 3102.01s]  I'll take, I'll take, I'll take one. Let's hope I get another one. Well, it is, it's my game now.
[3102.01s -> 3110.34s]  It's my game pick and you know, I, let's travel the world together. Let's play some GeoGuessr.
[3110.98s -> 3115.70s]  Sounds good. Oh, GeoGuessr, me and you. GeoGuessr sounds good. I'm actually pretty good at this
[3115.70s -> 3120.23s]  just to give you a quick little rundown. Really? Do you have like a history? Like
[3120.95s -> 3125.69s]  I've played it a few times on stream. Okay. Sure. I think I know somewhat where I am.
[3125.69s -> 3130.30s]  Do you know, is this world? I'm going to like burp in your face. I'm really sorry.
[3130.30s -> 3138.20s]  Is this world? It's actually the competitive mode. Oh, how does this work? I'll send you a link
[3138.20s -> 3146.10s]  and we duel head to head. We can do best of three. They're pretty fast. Okay. And basically you,
[3147.06s -> 3151.18s]  you just got to get it right, right off the bat. Yeah. You'll kind of see as it goes along,
[3151.18s -> 3156.06s]  but you get as much time as it takes one person to guess. The moment one person guesses,
[3156.06s -> 3161.75s]  the other person has 15 seconds to lock in a guess. You can, you can move around, zoom pan,
[3161.75s -> 3168.47s]  whatever. But, but it's 15 seconds after a guess is made and whoever's closest will get more points
[3168.47s -> 3172.79s]  and the difference in the points will take down your overall score. So you have like a life bar.
[3172.79s -> 3180.26s]  Oh, okay. So are we, are we, are we, am I in here? This is me. This is you, you're Sean.
[3180.82s -> 3186.86s]  You didn't say the whole thing. 200. Yeah. Is this, is this like an old name?
[3191.40s -> 3196.04s]  I just, before you became nine eight five. Are there other nine eight five names on the way?
[3196.04s -> 3200.52s]  Like, did you just end that German? But maybe like it was Sean 200, Jeremy 201,
[3201.08s -> 3206.84s]  Freddie 202. I took first names. It just kind of went from there. Right. Great. Yeah. They,
[3206.84s -> 3211.34s]  I asked my chat earlier what the nine eight five was and they said, well, this makes sense. Now
[3211.34s -> 3217.58s]  it's with a little bit of a tinkering in your brain, it should make sense. Yeah. Yeah. No,
[3217.58s -> 3223.46s]  I, I think I get there. It's grams is what it is. It's my, that's how many grams of sugar I put in
[3223.46s -> 3228.25s]  my coffee because I don't know. All right. So are you ready to explain how this works? But one,
[3228.25s -> 3231.69s]  two, three, four, five, just to look around, look around. Well, I'm not going to guess right away
[3231.69s -> 3236.57s]  here, but you look around and you make an educated guess anywhere in the world or is this United
[3236.57s -> 3241.37s]  States only anywhere in the world, anywhere. All right. I got it. I got it. And then you just,
[3241.37s -> 3246.26s]  when you feel comfortable and confident, you just drop a guess. And I don't want to say anything
[3246.26s -> 3251.30s]  because I don't want to give you, you prefer to mute up. You can mute up and kind of talk through
[3251.30s -> 3259.78s]  your thought process here. I'll like, but I did a bit for you. Okay. Okay. You already guessed.
[3259.78s -> 3266.15s]  Yeah. Well, I thought I thought it expedited for you, you know? Oh, fuck. Okay. Um, well,
[3266.15s -> 3274.15s]  I don't know. Seven seconds. I would click somewhere. How did you fucking, how did you do
[3274.15s -> 3278.87s]  that? How did you do that? Well, the license plate said blue on each side, which is exclusive
[3278.87s -> 3284.79s]  to Italy and Albania. How would you know that? Are you this well traveled? Yeah. You know,
[3284.79s -> 3291.91s]  I like to get out every once in a while. You know, I'm fluent in French. Yeah. I have not left
[3291.91s -> 3298.15s]  continental North America. You understand? Ever? Ever in my whole life. I thought you played the
[3298.15s -> 3304.79s]  game a bit though. You know, maybe. All right. I, I know what this is. I know what this could be
[3304.79s -> 3309.83s]  because we've, I, this is very specific. Okay. All right. 10 seconds. You can speak out loud,
[3309.83s -> 3314.55s]  speak free. I don't know. Oklahoma, somewhere in Oklahoma. What are you talking about? How would
[3314.55s -> 3319.19s]  you know that there was a guy on our lawnmower? How do you know that that's in fucking Austria?
[3323.19s -> 3326.79s]  No, I need to explain your thought process on that. A guy was on a fucking rider mower.
[3326.79s -> 3335.42s]  That's like John Deere. We're in Oklahoma. How did you figure that out? Uh, I, uh, so sorry. Um,
[3335.42s -> 3341.93s]  I figured it out because I drove, I buy a car and it had a European license plates. Uh, and then if
[3341.93s -> 3346.31s]  you look around, it's a bit, it's a bit gloomy. So I figured it's a bit South, right? You know,
[3346.31s -> 3352.63s]  we're not, we're not so North cause it's, it's still quite, uh, uh, flourishing with wildlife.
[3352.63s -> 3362.68s]  I've only been to like, like 12. I've, I play the game a bit and then I just figured it was,
[3362.68s -> 3367.96s]  it was middle EU. I got lucky on the hungry. I thought we were in like, okay, it was like
[3367.96s -> 3373.40s]  Oklahoma. It had a European license plate. I didn't, I, you, you guessed too quickly.
[3373.40s -> 3376.68s]  I couldn't even look at the license plate. I just saw a guy in like a lawnmower and I was like,
[3376.68s -> 3380.86s]  all right, this guy's got a big yard. He's got a big, a lot of grass. I don't know where his house
[3380.86s -> 3388.60s]  is. I wonder, is there a dual mode with just NA? No, no, we can do Europe. That was a good one.
[3388.60s -> 3393.98s]  I'll take Europe. Oh no, I can't, I can't. I'll just change. I'll change it to United States for
[3393.98s -> 3398.30s]  round two. I won one. It's now it's around two and it's just us this one. All right. Yeah,
[3398.30s -> 3402.78s]  no, we can do whatever. I think you can click on duels and maybe that'll do. Do you need a link
[3402.78s -> 3409.72s]  again? Um, do I just go to the menu? I can also do this for you. I think you have like a, oh yep.
[3409.72s -> 3416.57s]  Does that work? I think so. Yeah, it should, shouldn't it? It does, doesn't it? Okay.
[3418.01s -> 3427.62s]  All right. Just us. Just the United States. Bro, this is Canada. I can tell because there's a
[3427.62s -> 3432.58s]  license plate. The Canadian flag is right there in the red on the license plate. You see the lights
[3432.58s -> 3436.82s]  are red. The back lights are red and white. All right. It's not fucking around before I
[3437.86s -> 3457.11s]  how this one was just to rattle you. I have no idea. It's just a rattle me.
[3457.11s -> 3461.03s]  I, this was just, I have zero idea where this is. I won't even be close with my guess.
[3463.43s -> 3470.02s]  Texas. I thought somewhere in like New England. I thought New Hampshire. I just picked somewhere.
[3470.02s -> 3473.14s]  I couldn't even zoom in fast enough. I just picked the spot like up in New England.
[3473.14s -> 3510.04s]  Oh, hurry up. I don't know. I don't know. There's gonna be a sign here.
[3520.57s -> 3564.73s]  What the fuck did that say? Oh, who's closer? Me slightly. Did you find one of the highways?
[3564.73s -> 3569.74s]  Nah, I just figured it was like somewhere in the middle. I was trying to go to the airport.
[3569.74s -> 3575.90s]  You're trying to go to the airport? Yeah, because it'd be like, oh, welcome to beautiful,
[3575.90s -> 3600.60s]  like Chicago or something, right? Like at the airport. You must have found something in Utah.
[3603.05s -> 3609.05s]  I got stuck in the parking lot. Yeah, me too. I just clicked because I figured you would think
[3609.05s -> 3613.21s]  I know what I'm doing, but I didn't. That's actually a pretty good strategy, I think.
[3614.97s -> 3621.06s]  Try to get close enough and have the other person panic. Yeah. I just guessed central enough.
[3631.54s -> 3654.25s]  Very obviously. I know like where we are. Where are we? No way.
[3661.69s -> 3668.01s]  I thought it was like somewhere in like this like Ohio, Pittsburgh. I got lucky. A guy had
[3668.01s -> 3673.85s]  a Philadelphia Eagles sticker on his car. Oh shit. All right, this is a healing round. So
[3673.85s -> 3679.38s]  you can't lose here. It's all about just getting close and you can recover up to a quarter of the
[3679.38s -> 3690.10s]  points for your guess. That's a good strategy. Look for like stickers on cars. Uh huh. Yeah,
[3690.10s -> 3701.46s]  people are very, you ever thought about a German 985 bumper sticker? No. I thought I'd start
[3701.46s -> 3708.14s]  thinking about it. So I can drive around and find, see if somebody has it and like beep beep,
[3708.14s -> 3715.54s]  like beep and be like, hey man. You know, Jeep owners, they do a nod. It's like a thing. If
[3715.54s -> 3721.14s]  you have a Jeep, you nod at other Jeep owners. Maybe German sticker havers do like a sign to
[3721.14s -> 3729.70s]  each other that only they know. Oh, I see what you're saying. I have a little secret handshake.
[3729.70s -> 3743.45s]  Exactly. Where the hell does this want me to go? I don't want to go that way. What's that?
[3743.45s -> 3765.72s]  It's that. Oh, you were closer. It was Arkansas. I was thinking like Kansas. Yeah. Yeah. Just throw
[3765.72s -> 3771.34s]  an AR on it. You're there. Here we go. This is where it gets real. The 1.5x damage. Yeah,
[3771.34s -> 3782.28s]  you could beat me in one fell swoop if you get a good enough guess. Just literally this is every
[3782.28s -> 3800.70s]  neighborhood in America. I know. Seriously. I'm lost in cul-de-sacs. This could be anywhere.
[3801.50s -> 3813.00s]  Gotta find a main road or you're not. Oh, I thought that was going to be like,
[3813.00s -> 3832.38s]  I'm running for a Senator here. I'm just like making noises on your stream.
[3833.26s -> 3840.30s]  Sorry. I'm so deep in thought that your noises, it's like a good buffer.
[3850.46s -> 3869.72s]  Main road does not help. I feel like that's a guess. That was a bad guess. Oh, it's a great
[3869.72s -> 3886.78s]  guess from him. I'm thinking. I think I've seen Indiana. Well, I didn't say Indiana.
[3886.78s -> 3889.58s]  This is the big one. This is going to be whoever. This is going to be it.
[3890.46s -> 3895.62s]  This could be unless we're both very close. Yeah, this could seal it.
[3940.74s -> 3956.39s]  I thought that was a crispy cream. Oh, what the fuck? This place is called big D.
[3957.43s -> 3996.34s]  Any guesses on your end? I'm a little lost. He's not going to be close. Sorry. I lost.
[3997.06s -> 3999.94s]  I thought you said you were lost. Yeah, I lied.
[4003.14s -> 4005.54s]  That's why I was like, oh, I'll just be close. I'll be close enough.
[4005.54s -> 4010.26s]  Oh, no, no. I found a sign. I found a sign. Shit.
[4010.90s -> 4016.42s]  Uh, two, one, then two, one, then Jerma. Yeah, it's two, one.
[4016.42s -> 4023.69s]  Two, one and your pick as well. Okay. Don't be down on yourself. I won my game. It's normal.
[4023.69s -> 4030.31s]  I don't know how well you're going to do on this next one because we're playing pick Ross.
[4032.47s -> 4037.19s]  Did you have any opportunity to sit down and play pick Ross to even know how the game works?
[4039.03s -> 4043.59s]  This is picked up picks, right? It's picked up picks. Not one second.
[4043.59s -> 4048.95s]  You have not played even one second of this. Okay. So I mean, this is guaranteed win.
[4049.94s -> 4055.46s]  You didn't play one second. I thought I would just naturally beat you out of my gaming skills.
[4055.46s -> 4063.00s]  Oh, dude. Oh, I don't know, man. This is like a thing you need to know how to play.
[4063.56s -> 4067.93s]  But if you win, this could be a lie too. You could be making this up.
[4067.93s -> 4071.05s]  If you beat me without any experience, you have no idea what's going on.
[4071.05s -> 4074.65s]  Then I'm hanging up the gloves. Is this a single player?
[4074.65s -> 4080.02s]  Oh yeah. Here's what's going to happen. We are going to, I'm going to pick you a puzzle.
[4080.02s -> 4083.51s]  We're both going to do the puzzle at the same time, starting at the same time.
[4083.51s -> 4089.66s]  And whoever completes the puzzle first wins that round. We'll do best two out of three.
[4089.66s -> 4096.97s]  Oh, love that. So let's, uh, let's go ahead. We can be very, uh, democratic about this.
[4096.97s -> 4102.26s]  Okay. Okay. Great song by the way. Oh yeah. No, picked up picks is great.
[4102.26s -> 4106.58s]  Pick Ross is great too. Um, I hope you, uh, enjoy what you're doing because it's a very,
[4106.58s -> 4113.75s]  very much one of the greatest, uh, mind puzzles. Is there a difference?
[4115.80s -> 4118.52s]  Do you want me to pick Ross? I probably should give you
[4119.96s -> 4125.42s]  at least a small rundown of what's going on. I kind of have to in general,
[4125.42s -> 4128.30s]  it doesn't have to be in depth. Don't feel bad for me. You know,
[4128.86s -> 4132.86s]  okay. I brought you to GeoGuessr and you clicked on Oklahoma when it was hungry.
[4132.86s -> 4137.75s]  That's true. Uh, okay. Let's go ahead and let's, let's, let's do, let's do a tutorial.
[4138.47s -> 4143.43s]  I feel like that's fair. Okay. Sure. It's not fair if you do not get into a tutorial.
[4143.43s -> 4160.71s]  It's just, that's just a fact. Let me open it up. Okay. So, uh,
[4160.71s -> 4167.82s]  do you have access to the ones that are 15 by 15 by the way, or are they all locked in the,
[4167.82s -> 4174.84s]  just in classic mode, are they locked? Yeah, I think I can do it. Okay. Oh no,
[4174.84s -> 4177.88s]  they're locked. Oh, they are locked. Okay. Absolutely locked. Yeah.
[4179.16s -> 4182.76s]  This is going to be tricky. I can only do five by five. Oh, you can only do the five by fives.
[4185.34s -> 4189.34s]  What's wrong with that? Is that bad? That means we can't do the same puzzle. Wait,
[4189.34s -> 4192.62s]  you can't do the five by fives or you're already done. I've already done those five by fives.
[4194.26s -> 4197.78s]  There's a, there's an endless mode. What if we just do that? What is, what is that? Let's see.
[4197.78s -> 4200.82s]  I mean, let me try to get this captured. I can't get it captured. Why not?
[4204.98s -> 4215.43s]  Game capture. What's going on here, dude? Oh, this is just Voltorb flip. This is what? This
[4215.43s -> 4220.31s]  is Voltorb flip. I, I've played this game before. Voltorb flip? Uh huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4220.87s -> 4226.86s]  Hold on. Yeah. And, and Pokemon, they have a game called Voltorb flip and it's very similar to this.
[4227.58s -> 4238.25s]  Does Voltorb flip Picross? It is, it, that is exactly what this is. It is Voltorb flip.
[4238.25s -> 4242.25s]  Yeah. Slightly less. Um, there's a little more guessing in that game, but yeah.
[4242.25s -> 4248.55s]  All right. So here's what we're going to do. We'll do max, uh, with minimum width,
[4248.55s -> 4257.61s]  max width, do 15. Wait, wait, minimum width, max width. Yeah. Make it 15 by 15 or 15. Oh,
[4257.61s -> 4262.09s]  we can do 10 by 10. How do, how do you know when you're done, by the way, out of curiosity?
[4262.09s -> 4268.73s]  It will be, it'll complete. It'll be, you're making a picture. Great. So do 10 by 10 and just
[4268.73s -> 4274.97s]  do play. Okay. And let's go over some very basic. I'm so happy by the way that you're playing this.
[4275.85s -> 4279.21s]  Okay. Because dude, this is the new meta. I'm telling you, this is the new, another,
[4279.21s -> 4283.13s]  this is another, fuck it, fuck Battleship. Which, where do you want me to go for this?
[4283.69s -> 4290.87s]  I'll do endless and do 10 by 10. Endless max width, 10 max height, 10.
[4292.33s -> 4296.57s]  Now it's probably going to give us, it's probably going to give us different puzzles. I'm going to
[4296.57s -> 4302.39s]  assume because yours probably does not look like mine. No, I see your screen. They're different.
[4302.39s -> 4307.80s]  They are different. Okay. So, hmm. We may have to pivot. We may have to pivot to
[4307.80s -> 4310.76s]  neutral. No, no, no. Click through a couple of times here. Let me see what you're getting into.
[4310.76s -> 4317.27s]  Okay. So let's do a tutorial. Oh, this is awesome. Okay. So how Picross works. Hi,
[4317.27s -> 4322.92s]  ladies and gentlemen. Welcome. How Picross works, my friend, is this. You have a grid
[4322.92s -> 4329.80s]  and you have a series of numbers. This is not, um, Sudoku. So shut up. This is different.
[4329.80s -> 4333.64s]  Where you start is you see these numbers I have on the left and numbers I have on top,
[4333.64s -> 4340.52s]  versus this one here is six. What this means is this means that six of these squares are going
[4340.52s -> 4352.68s]  to be filled in on this row. They will also be filled in horizontally. So this six is part of
[4352.68s -> 4358.44s]  this one, two, one, two. Do you understand? What is one, two? Why do they express it? One, two,
[4358.44s -> 4365.93s]  one, two. I'm so glad you asked that question. A six. So on the left side, in between each one of
[4365.93s -> 4372.41s]  these numbers, there has to be at least one space. But let's say for instance, if the one was right
[4372.41s -> 4380.87s]  here, the two would have to be at least here. You cannot, yeah, they cannot be, uh, if there's a
[4380.87s -> 4387.83s]  space in between, they cannot be touching. So for instance, we got four, one, one down here. That
[4387.83s -> 4393.91s]  means there's going to be four in a row somewhere, a space, a one and a space. That space does not
[4393.91s -> 4399.82s]  mean one space. That means any amount of spaces. So that means it could be one, two, three, four,
[4400.70s -> 4409.58s]  all these spaces, one space, one. And you have to use logic to deduce exactly where these pieces
[4409.58s -> 4415.85s]  need to go. So if you, let's do, let's, let's, let's do a little bit of logic here. So if you've
[4415.85s -> 4423.59s]  got 10 spaces here, it has to be some of the middle that have filled in. It has to be, has to be. So
[4423.59s -> 4429.91s]  one, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. You know, for certain, these two
[4429.91s -> 4439.27s]  have to be filled in. They have to be 100% of the time. Following. I'm following. Following. So this
[4439.27s -> 4443.75s]  is where it gets hard because you have to figure out where, because you're looking up the top row,
[4443.75s -> 4448.39s]  you're looking at the bottom row and there's no way for you to tell. Initially, you have to kind
[4448.39s -> 4453.75s]  of work backwards in a way. So let's start here. By the way, there's only 10 spaces. So if you have
[4453.75s -> 4460.76s]  an opportunity where it's like four, five, six, seven, eight, you know that eight of these spaces
[4460.76s -> 4467.29s]  are filled in. There's only 10. So I mean, it's, it's fun. It's really the top 10 game on,
[4467.37s -> 4472.71s]  but we've already did it. What? No, no, no, no. I'm just, I'm working on it a little bit here.
[4472.71s -> 4480.04s]  Okay. So that's the concept of the game. Okay. So for, let's, let's see if I can do this. This
[4480.04s -> 4488.10s]  one's kind of tricky because that's four, one, one. It has to be the high. Uh, actually, I don't know.
[4491.78s -> 4496.58s]  One, four, one, any of these equal 10. I don't think so. Wait, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4496.58s -> 4502.26s]  Okay. All right. Perfect example. Perfect example. You see this one right here? Uh-huh.
[4502.26s -> 4508.65s]  You see how that's a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And there are three spaces,
[4509.59s -> 4514.31s]  eight, nine, total 10. Take a look at that. Ladies and gentlemen. Now you've got yourself
[4514.31s -> 4519.96s]  a full row and block these out. So you don't fuck it up for yourself later. Interesting.
[4521.96s -> 4526.36s]  Out. There's other one, two, three ones. You are, you know, that that's certain that they're going
[4526.36s -> 4532.63s]  to be filled in and that gives you information here as well. See these ones up here. Um, excuse
[4532.63s -> 4537.77s]  me. If these are all ones, you know, for a fact, there has to be a space between them.
[4538.94s -> 4541.42s]  There has to be. So that's blocked off and that's blocked off.
[4542.70s -> 4550.68s]  Someone said, stop. This is awful. What? I think this is great. This is great. This is
[4550.68s -> 4557.69s]  a good look out. He's pretending. I don't think you're pretending. I'm pretending. What would I
[4557.69s -> 4565.08s]  be pretending? Yeah. I know what. All right. So here two, one, two, two, one, two. It's let me, uh,
[4565.08s -> 4570.20s]  student Ludwig. Uh huh. Yeah, please. Would you, what would you see? What would you consider
[4570.20s -> 4575.00s]  doing here on the, which one? The two, one, two. Yeah. What would you, I mean, do you have
[4575.00s -> 4579.16s]  any information that you think you could give me? Right. Right. Two, one, two. Let's take a peek at
[4579.16s -> 4585.64s]  this bad boy on the two, one, two over here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, a lot of information actually.
[4585.64s -> 4590.28s]  Now that I'm, I'm like, I'm zooming out a bit. I'm zooming out a bit to be clear. You're talking
[4590.28s -> 4593.72s]  about the two, one, two, the left. I'm talking about the left two, one, two here. Right. The
[4593.72s -> 4599.08s]  left two, one, two, the information in so interesting. That's when you bring it up.
[4599.08s -> 4604.20s]  The middle probably can't have anything around it. Right. That is exactly precisely what's going on.
[4604.20s -> 4610.12s]  So probably got to block those guys out. Yes. Shut off the blinds. There is minimum. Now, you know,
[4610.84s -> 4615.24s]  you know that this is the two. Oh yeah. Has to go this way or it has to go this way. You
[4615.24s -> 4618.52s]  don't have that info, so don't be careful. Don't do it. Don't know yet. Don't know yet. We'll get
[4618.52s -> 4623.00s]  there. You might get baby steps. You know, there's another thing. You know that the other two is here
[4623.00s -> 4627.48s]  somewhere. You don't know if it's here. It's like Battleship, right? Like, you don't, you're trying
[4627.48s -> 4631.16s]  to figure out where that ship is. Where's that too? Where is it going to be sticking this way?
[4631.16s -> 4636.28s]  Could it be over here? It's, it's too, it's too early to tell. I'd say it's similar to Battleship.
[4636.28s -> 4645.03s]  Yeah. Yeah. But again, take a look down here. What would you do with this? Uh, down four, one,
[4645.03s -> 4649.83s]  one, you probably got to do all the four on the left, right? Bottom left. Well, hold on, slow down.
[4650.81s -> 4655.85s]  I guess, I guess that's not necessarily the case. What do you absolutely know with this right here?
[4656.49s -> 4663.06s]  Uh, this can't be the four because obviously if that was the four, remember it's, it's sequential.
[4663.06s -> 4667.54s]  This has to be the first number in, in this row. Right. If this is part of the four,
[4669.00s -> 4673.24s]  it would have to be like one, two, three. Let's see. Yeah. If this was the four,
[4673.96s -> 4678.92s]  it would have to be one, two, three, four and then space one, space one. But you don't know
[4678.92s -> 4684.20s]  that information yet. So this could be the, it could be part of the four. You never just
[4684.20s -> 4689.24s]  YOLO guess and rip it. You could, but you got to get it right. Right. You YOLO guess and rip it.
[4689.24s -> 4695.00s]  You, the picture will not complete. Makes sense. Makes sense. Is it, so it's always a picture. Is
[4695.00s -> 4701.35s]  that the, is that the case? It's always a picture. Interesting. Okay. All right. I think I'm getting
[4701.35s -> 4706.15s]  the hang of it. I think I'm slightly. Yeah. I think I'm slightly getting the hang of it. I'm getting
[4706.15s -> 4710.71s]  like inch by inch. You know? Yeah. Rome was built today. It's a really fun game. I would
[4710.71s -> 4716.01s]  highly recommend it. All right. So let me see if I can figure this one out while we are. You do
[4716.01s -> 4719.77s]  that one and let me, let me mull this guy over. Right. Let me just, yeah, mull it over. You're
[4719.77s -> 4728.15s]  good. Give it, give it a stab. Yeah. Just mull it over. So I'll start this mulling this one.
[4728.15s -> 4732.79s]  This is, this is part of the two, but I don't know where this is part of the two, but I'm not entirely
[4732.79s -> 4740.04s]  sure. Two, three, four, five, six, nine. I don't have that info yet. So it's tricky. This one
[4740.04s -> 4746.94s]  actually is pretty tricky because it's really a lot of low numbers here. It really could be
[4746.94s -> 4758.60s]  anywhere. I mean, okay. It has to be, take a look at this. All right. We know that. I mean,
[4758.60s -> 4763.46s]  he's already done. I'm not done. Come on. They're just, they're toying around, right? What are you
[4763.46s -> 4767.54s]  talking about? Have you been, wait, this is, is it, are we doing this one for real? What's that? No,
[4767.54s -> 4771.30s]  we're just having fun right now. You're getting stressed out. All right. This is, this one's for,
[4771.62s -> 4774.18s]  all right. All right. All right. All right. He's, he, I see what you're doing.
[4775.46s -> 4780.65s]  I'm gonna be quiet because I can't talk and play this game. It takes way too much of my brain power.
[4781.86s -> 4812.68s]  I don't blame you. It's hard. This one's actually really hard. I got a really hard one. What makes
[4812.68s -> 4817.72s]  it hard? A lot of low numbers, not having like free ones, like free spaces. The way this game
[4817.72s -> 4822.84s]  gets really hard is when you have a lot of low numbers that do not equal close to the maximum
[4822.84s -> 4828.04s]  on the grid. So if you have a bunch of ones and twos, it's, it's, you have to really work backwards.
[4829.16s -> 4847.14s]  Shit. I've got to make a decision here. I've got to make a decision. I got a terrible one. It's,
[4847.14s -> 4852.18s]  okay. So the ones that are endless, I think are random. So I don't know if I can like logically
[4852.18s -> 4862.76s]  deduce this one. Okay. So I did my puzzle. I think I got it. Did it finish? Yeah. Yeah. It like popped
[4862.76s -> 4867.00s]  up and it said, well done. Oh, you finished it. All right. Okay. All right. So you get it. I think
[4867.00s -> 4870.92s]  I get it. All right. You get it. Let's boot it. Let's do a, let's do one for real. All right. You
[4870.92s -> 4877.32s]  want to do a big one? Yeah. 15 by 15. Is that the normal 15 by 15? Okay. And endless mode, I suppose.
[4877.32s -> 4880.84s]  I guess we'll do endless mode. Okay. All right. And we're going to, I guess we'll mute because
[4880.84s -> 4884.76s]  I'm going to be, I need to focus in. Yeah, no, I think that's fair. I think it's fair. You click
[4884.76s -> 4896.34s]  on the size multiples of five and square grid checkboxes, right? Um, endless isn't like concrete
[4896.34s -> 4899.22s]  pictures. If that's a multiple of five. Yeah. What's that? I don't know what that means.
[4900.18s -> 4905.98s]  It was pre-checked. So I guess I'll keep it. Maybe yours was pre-checked. Yeah. Oh yeah. I think
[4905.98s -> 4909.98s]  that, okay. Checked and means is, is the, okay. Yeah. I see. Yeah. All right. You ready to do it?
[4909.98s -> 4918.76s]  Yeah. Let's boot up. All right. I'm good luck. Good luck. Yeah. Let's go 15 by 15. Let's do it.
[4919.40s -> 4925.59s]  Fuck. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Pick Ross, baby. All right. 15 shit. This is going to take a long time. I
[4925.59s -> 4930.95s]  don't think he's prepared. It's like an hour, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[4930.95s -> 4938.71s]  Shit. It's close though. I got to be a guarantee. Shit. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,
[4938.71s -> 4947.05s]  12, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Fuck you. Did I count wrong? Five, six,
[4947.05s -> 4958.15s]  seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I don't know. I can't make that deduction. I, I mean,
[4958.79s -> 4978.41s]  I can get the nine. Nine, one, two, five, six, seven, eight, nine. We got that. Good start. Good
[4978.41s -> 4998.12s]  start. Fuck. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I'm going to lose in my own fucking
[4998.12s -> 5006.28s]  game. 14. It's not enough. I don't, it could either be here and down or here and down, right?
[5006.28s -> 5011.77s]  But fuck, there's no way for me to tell. Fuck. I'm going to lose in my own game. I'm going to lose
[5011.77s -> 5036.60s]  in my own game that I picked and I was so confident. Six. Okay. One, two, six. Fuck,
[5036.60s -> 5060.79s]  that's 14. I'm going to lose in my own game. I can't even go anywhere. I don't know where
[5060.79s -> 5066.42s]  to start from this. This is probably the one, but I don't know. It could be anything.
[5075.80s -> 5079.94s]  This, I'm going to have to just go for it, but I, there's no way for me to know.
[5081.21s -> 5087.83s]  One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. There has to be one here and then somewhere in
[5087.83s -> 5095.00s]  the middle of the three. Why did they pick Picross? The endless mode is random numbers.
[5095.00s -> 5115.99s]  I didn't know it was going to be random. I'm fucked. All right. Start over here.
[5118.50s -> 5129.14s]  And 11, 12, four, one. No, I can't do it. Four, five, six, seven. There's nowhere to start.
[5130.02s -> 5136.82s]  There's nowhere to start. Bro, there's nowhere to start. There's nowhere for me to go from here.
[5136.82s -> 5140.50s]  I don't think I can fucking do this one. There's nowhere for me to go. I have to guess.
[5142.26s -> 5147.32s]  Or five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. This is part of the two. I don't fucking know.
[5155.91s -> 5163.75s]  Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The thing is I'm, if I get this wrong,
[5163.75s -> 5176.02s]  the whole thing is fucked up. Okay. Relax. It has to be one, two, three, four, one. It has to be
[5176.02s -> 5188.55s]  this. It has to be. And then the, I don't know where the three is though. One, two, three, four,
[5188.55s -> 5202.52s]  five, one, two, three. I don't know. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
[5203.40s -> 5212.63s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. One, two, three, four, five. This has to be this.
[5213.27s -> 5251.10s]  Two, three, four, five, right? Yeah. It's going to be so embarrassing when he comes over to the
[5251.10s -> 5257.26s]  stream. When he comes over and he finishes and he sees this, it's going to be the most embarrassing
[5257.26s -> 5260.46s]  moment of my career. It's going to be the most embarrassing moment of my entire career.
[5261.34s -> 5265.29s]  He's going to be like, all right, man, that was pretty easy. And he's going to come over
[5265.29s -> 5289.98s]  and I'm going to be like, I don't know, I have four spaces filled in. It's so fucking much harder
[5289.98s -> 5297.40s]  than the regular ones. Okay. Four, two, I don't fucking know, man. I have to guess in random
[5297.40s -> 5304.58s]  directions, I think. I have to guess. I have to guess. Fuck. Okay. It's time to guess because
[5304.58s -> 5313.74s]  there's no way for me to logically fucking deduce this random mode. I'm going for it. We're going
[5313.74s -> 5331.13s]  for a guess. If it's wrong, the whole thing's fucked anyways. It's wrong. This is definitely
[5331.13s -> 5341.67s]  not, this is one of the ones. I got it. It's wrong. That has to go. Yeah. Yep. I got, I deduced
[5341.67s -> 5350.52s]  this one with my fucking brain. Check this out. See this? That's definitely one of the ones. The
[5350.52s -> 5376.73s]  two is over here somewhere. I've deduced it. Shit. No, I didn't. I don't think I can actually
[5376.73s -> 5388.18s]  logically figure this out. But if you guess and it's wrong, the whole thing is over. I've tried
[5388.18s -> 5399.45s]  to hit you with a battle ax. He's like fucking swinging at me and I'm dodging. I have to go for
[5399.45s -> 5403.85s]  it because how the fuck? And maybe I know that at least because there's no way this is part of the
[5403.85s -> 5411.67s]  two. Am I getting a bloody nose from this? No. So this is probably part of the four. It is. This is
[5411.67s -> 5416.07s]  probably part of the four. One, two, three, four. So we're going to say it can't be that way.
[5418.60s -> 5426.97s]  It's also, it's maybe not though. I don't know that because this could be one, two, three, four,
[5426.97s -> 5450.10s]  one, two. Yeah. I don't fucking know that. Bro. This is so hard. If I'm going to at least say
[5450.10s -> 5457.26s]  that this is not the two that I'm going to commit to it. If I commit to that, then that means one,
[5457.26s -> 5467.88s]  two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four. These can be filled in. I was at the one or part
[5467.88s -> 5474.73s]  of the three. Is this the two? There's no, I, there's no way to tell. There's no way to tell.
[5475.45s -> 5492.14s]  Ludwig said, please let's do an easier one. Hey, what's up? Oh, hello. Hello. How are you doing?
[5492.14s -> 5497.58s]  Um, I'm doing okay. Did you finish a little bit of guessing? No, did you? You didn't? Oh my God,
[5497.58s -> 5503.34s]  dude. Look at my stream. You didn't finish. Wait, what do you, you're, you're barely through it.
[5503.74s -> 5511.93s]  It's way too hard to 15 by 15 is a bit, it's a bit, it's a lot. It's a, it's a mental task.
[5511.93s -> 5518.31s]  Um, I think part of the problem is because it's endless random mode. It might be even harder
[5518.31s -> 5525.19s]  because when you completed the last one, did you make a picture? It was like vines. Okay. It was
[5525.19s -> 5531.19s]  like over earth. Like I would not have seen it as a picture normally. How are you doing?
[5531.91s -> 5537.16s]  I'm doing okay. You know, I, I'm, I'm hanging in there. Would you like to go to a, to a 10 by 10?
[5537.88s -> 5542.44s]  I am down to go to a 10 by 10. Yeah. Cause I think this would take me a good 45 minutes. Yeah. And
[5542.44s -> 5547.72s]  I know you've got to go at like six or something. So I got at least six, seven. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um,
[5548.60s -> 5552.76s]  I suppose too hard. So, all right, all right, all right, let's do it. Let's do a 10 by 10.
[5554.10s -> 5558.58s]  You have no idea. I thought you were running through it. I thought you were just smoking me.
[5558.58s -> 5562.42s]  I'm sitting here panicking. I was like, this is over. Like I picked the game and I can't even do
[5562.42s -> 5569.93s]  it. I think it's I'm going fast, but I was so worried that it's like at the end, it's not going
[5569.93s -> 5573.13s]  to complete. And I'm going to look back and be like, Oh, cause it's a couple of points. I'm just
[5573.13s -> 5578.47s]  like, I'll put the six there. Cause uh, cause it just feels, it feels nice. It feels good to just
[5578.47s -> 5583.03s]  click it. But if you're wrong, the whole thing's messed up. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So I was, I was
[5583.03s -> 5589.61s]  making a lot of risky plays. 10 by 10 will be a lot easier. 10 by 10. I feel great. We are going
[5589.61s -> 5593.85s]  to cap this out in 10 minutes each. I imagine. I think so. All right. You ready? All right. Yeah.
[5593.85s -> 5602.55s]  Yeah. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. Much better. Much better. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[5603.19s -> 5618.39s]  anything I need to build eight, five. I can one, two, three, four, five. I don't know that. I can't
[5618.39s -> 5625.24s]  do that. I can't fuck you. What are you talking about? The two, let's just assume the two is here.
[5626.04s -> 5634.62s]  Let's just assume that's the two. Cause we have to, right? One, there's your one, there's your one.
[5634.62s -> 5640.86s]  Let's go ahead. Let's get that one, two. Let's assume the two is here. Just assume it.
[5643.11s -> 5658.97s]  Okay. That's part of the one. That's part of this one. Also part of the one. It's part of the three.
[5658.97s -> 5670.47s]  This part of the two, one, two, or one, two. The rest of this cannot be filled in. All right. Five.
[5670.47s -> 5676.09s]  There's your five. There's your two. There's your two. There's your three. There's your two.
[5676.81s -> 5680.81s]  There's your two. Four is up here somewhere. Okay. We've got one, two, three, four, one, two,
[5680.81s -> 5689.37s]  three. Let's assume the two is here. Four, there's your one. There's your one.
[5690.73s -> 5697.37s]  Go to that. Now we can say with an assumption here, we've got that situated. Go ahead and say
[5697.37s -> 5703.37s]  that's one. We've got the one there. There's your two. There's your one. We're here somewhere. Three
[5703.37s -> 5715.38s]  and two. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. It has to be right. One, two, three, four. It has to
[5715.38s -> 5728.22s]  be in the middle here. It has to be. There's your one. Wait, if we're accepting that. Wait,
[5728.94s -> 5739.42s]  we're accepting that, then one, two is here. What? Yes, it has to be. There's your two.
[5740.30s -> 5746.97s]  There's your one right there. Still looking for a one here. There's your two. There's your one.
[5746.97s -> 5786.54s]  That row's done. There's your two. It has to be there. It has to be there. Three, two.
[5790.04s -> 5813.43s]  Three. There's your two right there. There's your two. There's your. Where is it? All right,
[5813.43s -> 5825.19s]  relax. It's your three. Probably. This is your three. It has to be. Yep, this is your two and
[5825.19s -> 5837.59s]  your three. Right? Right. Yep. Oh no, no, no. Go back, go back, go back, back, back, back, back,
[5837.59s -> 5849.00s]  back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back before I did that. This is the one. This is the
[5849.00s -> 5854.15s]  two. This has to be there. There you go. Get rid of this. This is the two. But what direction?
[5854.15s -> 5866.70s]  That way. This is the three. But what direction? I don't know. Here's your three. Two, two. This
[5866.70s -> 5874.65s]  is the one. No, it couldn't. It might not be. Yes, it is. Here's your two. One, one. Fuck. No, wrong.
[5877.18s -> 5892.60s]  Um, this is the two and then one, two, one, one. Here it is. This is the three then. Yep,
[5892.60s -> 5902.98s]  there's three. This is done. Dude, this is the two and there's your one. There's your two. There's
[5902.98s -> 5911.62s]  your one. There's your two. What the fuck am I drawing here? There it is. Got it. Bingo.
[5914.92s -> 5923.70s]  Uh, I got it. That's a, uh, that's a completed picture. I've no, you were quick. I have no idea
[5923.70s -> 5930.47s]  what this is. I want you to know you, you bested me. Uh, cause I, I was still, I was still really
[5930.47s -> 5939.50s]  thinking. I was still mulling it over. Uh, this is, this is, it's a hard game. It's very hard. Uh,
[5939.50s -> 5947.88s]  which means this, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I don't want to stall and finish my painting. I'm just close.
[5947.88s -> 5953.77s]  No, no, do it. I mean, I just did it. So yeah, I mean, they're, they're tricky, man. They really
[5953.77s -> 5971.80s]  are. Okay. One, one, two. They're really fun though. Got it. Dude, you were, um, you were
[5971.80s -> 5979.62s]  literally 30 seconds behind me. So yeah, it took me six minutes, 10 seconds, a little over, a little
[5979.62s -> 5985.32s]  over. All right. That's your win though. That's your win. Yeah. So, you know, hey, credit where
[5985.32s -> 5990.36s]  credit's due, but that's a good game. Oh, do you want to do best? No, we don't want that. We don't
[5990.36s -> 5994.12s]  ask you a serious question. Be, please. I, you know, you and I know each other pretty well now.
[5994.12s -> 5999.90s]  Uh huh. Do you hate this? This game? Yeah. No, I actually think this game's fun. Okay. All right.
[5999.90s -> 6008.41s]  Cool. I played a game on the, on, on, I think it's Pokemon Platinum, maybe earlier, but there's a
[6008.41s -> 6014.98s]  game called Voltorb Flip that is very similar to this, but there is a level of RNG in it.
[6015.06s -> 6021.67s]  So it's, it's only, um, it's only five by five, uh, but there are like bad squares. And if you
[6021.67s -> 6027.91s]  click the bad squares, you lose. Yeah. There are versions of that. We'll do that too. Right. They,
[6027.91s -> 6034.07s]  they add like a minute to your time or something. If you get it wrong. I probably played that game
[6034.07s -> 6041.13s]  for maybe eight hours straight. Yeah. Uh, it just like getting upset. I've melted, I've melted
[6042.26s -> 6049.29s]  eight to 10 hours just lying in bed, laying the one on the DS. And it's like, it's like 12 o'clock
[6049.29s -> 6052.98s]  at night or like one o'clock in the morning. And the sun starts coming up and you're just like,
[6052.98s -> 6058.22s]  oh shit. And you just put it down and roll over and go to bed. Yeah. I, I, I can't imagine,
[6058.22s -> 6064.07s]  I'm looking at classic mode, right? And it, and it has the, uh, what is it? The, the 40 by 40s.
[6065.21s -> 6071.99s]  I can't imagine that. No, that, that's like a 2000 piece jigsaw. That would take me like a,
[6071.99s -> 6077.74s]  like a few weeks to chew through. I feel like some of these would be almost impossible to do
[6077.74s -> 6083.64s]  with in less than a day or two. Why did you get two crowns? Um, probably just under six minutes,
[6083.64s -> 6092.90s]  five minutes, maybe I don't even have access to the 40 by 41. So 40 by 30. Uh, all right,
[6092.90s -> 6098.86s]  let's, let's boot up next game. Jerma, are we gone? That's a good game. It is really good.
[6100.38s -> 6105.13s]  And you're off time. You boot up like, uh, the pick the one on switch is really good too. Yes.
[6105.85s -> 6110.86s]  Are you just zoned out playing that? Just edging on the couch. It's so awesome. Cause you can just
[6110.86s -> 6114.62s]  have that like on your lap while you're watching TV or something. And it just something that sits
[6114.62s -> 6122.84s]  there. It's awesome. That sounds awesome. So where are we going? Super auto pets. So it's,
[6122.84s -> 6130.68s]  it's going to be two, two, two to two. Cause there's no way I win this. I will try. How do we play
[6130.68s -> 6135.08s]  together? Are we just trying to get to, we're, we're going against each other. Yeah. Oh, really?
[6135.08s -> 6140.86s]  Uh-huh. That's kind of cool. Is that new? Uh, they've had it, but it was a little laggy at the
[6140.86s -> 6150.26s]  start. It's, it's a little, we did the tournament this way. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. That's right. Uh,
[6150.26s -> 6156.30s]  I'm sending you a code. Do I need like any of the expansions or anything? No. I think I, I think I
[6156.30s -> 6162.09s]  have one of the first expansion pet pack. Yeah. That's it. That's the only one there is. Okay.
[6162.09s -> 6169.61s]  Cool. It opened. So you, are you still into this, huh? You still into this game? Yeah. I've seen
[6169.61s -> 6176.33s]  you playing it. They just released a new pack that has like, there were 80 pets. Originally there's
[6176.33s -> 6184.18s]  80 new pets. Um, 80, 80, 80. There's, there's, it's like a whole new game now. Uh, there's a pack
[6184.18s -> 6189.78s]  that it carries none of the pets over. So it's, it was, it's foreign to me. So it's like a new
[6189.78s -> 6197.94s]  game in a way. Jesus. And I'm, I'm one of the pets. I'm one of the pets. You are. Yeah. Um,
[6197.94s -> 6205.66s]  ready? I'll just, I'll do it for you. I can't wait to hear that in the game. Do you know what? It's
[6205.74s -> 6213.06s]  obviously a fish. Yeah. A gold. Oh, all right. Yeah. All right. So what versus mode? Uh, it is,
[6213.06s -> 6227.02s]  it is versus mode. And then I sent you the code on discord and that's joined private. Okay. Join
[6227.02s -> 6233.58s]  private game. Uh huh. And then you're in. We're good. We're good. We're good to go. Yeah. We're
[6233.58s -> 6239.10s]  going to go. So now it's, you have 15 lives and you lose a certain amount of lives if you, uh,
[6239.10s -> 6243.24s]  all right. So are we going to, are we muting and going to our separate? Oh, we do. So we talk.
[6243.24s -> 6247.80s]  Yeah. You don't want it to reveal too much. We can talk during the battle. Okay. Okay. 13
[6248.20s -> 6258.36s]  time or the bottom, right? And it's ticking down fast. Okay. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[6258.36s -> 6263.96s]  know. I, I, I honestly forgot how to play that. I forgot everything about the game. Did you get a
[6263.96s -> 6270.07s]  full? Oh, you got a full squad off. Okay. I was worried. Yeah. Yep. I kind of forgot everything.
[6270.07s -> 6277.42s]  I mean, it's a great start. That is not a bad start. That's all right. I'll take a trade.
[6280.58s -> 6288.18s]  How much time is on the clock for you? Oh, it was seven seconds. Great. Great. Great. Excuse me.
[6288.98s -> 6293.78s]  Wait, you need to turn that timer up my hair. Excuse me. Did you get to even do your turn?
[6294.58s -> 6300.81s]  I just put random shit up here. Oh yeah. That was a random bunch of shit.
[6301.37s -> 6307.77s]  Let me, let me double check to see the clock. Hey, I like it. You know what? No, no, let's,
[6308.49s -> 6311.69s]  my timer is stuck at 15. I'm going to, I'm going to redo it. I'm going to redo it. All right. All
[6311.69s -> 6326.84s]  right. So funny. Turn on fast forward to get more time. I don't know what that means. I'll just give
[6326.84s -> 6336.30s]  a 60 seconds per turn. Abandoned game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Abandoned. Same code though.
[6338.14s -> 6349.50s]  Is it available now? It should be. Oh, you are using the pay to win pack. I am. Which is fine.
[6349.50s -> 6353.82s]  I think that's fine. Did I turn that off? I can turn it off. Let me know. Let me just also use
[6353.82s -> 6363.18s]  it. We can both use it. Okay. All right. Uh, add an S at the end of the code and it should be good.
[6363.18s -> 6373.70s]  No. Okay. Actually, no, no. I'm sorry. Don't go in. Uh, add two S's at the end. Two S's. People
[6373.70s -> 6377.46s]  saying show your screen. Why do you think I'm not showing the screen between these things?
[6378.18s -> 6384.82s]  Okay. I am. All right. Now you can show the screen and we have, yeah, we have about a minute per
[6384.82s -> 6390.65s]  turn. All right. Perfect. All right. Good luck, man. Good luck. Good luck. I mean, I'm not supposed
[6390.65s -> 6393.29s]  to tell you like a fucking story when I'm, when I went to like the Dunkin Donuts drive through,
[6393.29s -> 6401.98s]  because I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. How about this one? This bird. You buy food one,
[6401.98s -> 6409.94s]  one until end of battle. Mosquito. I like that. Hold on. I can, I can roll, right? You can,
[6409.94s -> 6422.71s]  how many, how much money, what does it cost three to pick to get people? I know this is good. So
[6422.71s -> 6439.24s]  then end turn, give left most friend one attack. I think that sounds fun. I mean, that's, that's an
[6439.24s -> 6450.44s]  oxymoron, right? All right. What do you got? Honey. Oh, I went with the little honey play.
[6451.00s -> 6461.86s]  Okay. That gets that summons the bug. That's right. All right. Okay. It's just a start. It's
[6461.86s -> 6467.22s]  just the first part. That's fine. Early. It's early game. Yeah. I, you don't even see my screen
[6467.22s -> 6470.98s]  right now, which is holy shit. The next turn is going to be unbelievable. See in a minute.
[6496.65s -> 6508.50s]  I don't know. This is random. So we're hoping it goes to the mosquito. Use the honey. What? How
[6508.50s -> 6519.90s]  much does it cost? I thought it was three. Is it, is it one? I know it's three. Yeah. Oh, right in
[6519.90s -> 6535.16s]  the back. I see you doing fish strategy. I see. I think I'm still okay. Take that one.
[6536.82s -> 6550.34s]  Didn't even respond to me. He's still muted. All right. This is okay. Hold on. Did I, did I
[6550.34s -> 6563.32s]  fuck that up? Enter and give five, five to a friend ahead of a head of what that sounds insane.
[6563.32s -> 6567.34s]  I want you to know, I didn't ignore you. It was just, it was the longest piss I've ever done in
[6567.34s -> 6576.14s]  my life. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I don't know what that does. I think, I think I'm
[6576.14s -> 6589.34s]  good. It's like awesome powers. It just kept coming. Oh my God. What a behemoth. You have a
[6589.34s -> 6597.37s]  chick. What are you practicing? Hey, I mean, when you tell me that you've got to, we're doing a
[6597.37s -> 6601.85s]  bro versus bro, I need to be at least somewhat prepared for it. Got to bring the A game, I guess.
[6601.85s -> 6610.62s]  I took a bath last night. Where's the relevance? There is none. I have no place in it. You take
[6610.62s -> 6616.07s]  baths a lot. You a bath guy? I am. Are you a bath guy? I love taking baths. Really?
[6617.03s -> 6620.63s]  Yes. Yeah. What's your favorite Epsom salt flavor? That's an important question.
[6620.63s -> 6627.74s]  I've been going to Himalayan recently. I like the orange too. Yeah, that's fair. That's good.
[6627.74s -> 6635.24s]  I pretend I'm an athlete when I, when I use the salts. You doing like a cold bath? No,
[6636.04s -> 6640.50s]  it's warm, but I feel like the salt, it's like, oh, my muscles are rejuvenating.
[6640.50s -> 6646.42s]  I have an athlete's heart rate. Did you know that? That's pretty sick. What's your resting?
[6646.42s -> 6653.91s]  120, whatever it is, a hundred and a hundred, maybe 90. A hundred? I don't, I have no idea.
[6653.91s -> 6660.22s]  Mine's 40. You have a 40 resting heart rate. It's 47. Yeah. Oh, you do not. I have a 47
[6660.22s -> 6667.08s]  resting heart rate. Yeah. You just keep juicing this guy. I'm not lying to you. I got a 40
[6667.08s -> 6671.74s]  resting heart rate. I don't know what you like. Were you actually like an athlete?
[6672.86s -> 6678.22s]  You know, I played, I played on soccer teams. I was, I was involved in the action.
[6678.22s -> 6686.28s]  That's actually, that's really, really good. I think my resting heart rate score is 70. 75.
[6687.80s -> 6691.96s]  Jimmy, I don't think that's great. I'm almost, I'm a neurotic fuck though, dude. Like I'm all over
[6691.96s -> 6698.95s]  the place. Wait, wait. In what sense? It's just like my heart rate just, I'm just so, my energy
[6698.95s -> 6704.63s]  level just skyrockets and comes down and skyrockets. I'm kind of a mess. I feel that. I feel that.
[6711.51s -> 6723.05s]  Are you a daily coffee drinker? Uh, I, yes, I am. I quit recently. Someone quit. Do you
[6723.61s -> 6728.81s]  do any other caffeinated beverages or did you just drop every day? Okay. Green or black?
[6728.81s -> 6733.58s]  Uh, black tea, black tea, black tea. That's good shit. Oh, this is where we get started.
[6733.58s -> 6739.93s]  This is where we get started. Rev it up. Rev it up. Rev it up, baby. Oh, slow it down. Slow the,
[6739.93s -> 6752.70s]  turn the engine off. This is the comeback I needed. I like green tea. You want me to prove it?
[6754.87s -> 6757.99s]  Like why are you, you want me to prove it? Yeah. Why would I need to prove that too?
[6759.93s -> 6762.81s]  Yeah. I don't know. Prove it. Prove that you like green tea to me.
[6766.33s -> 6775.10s]  Yeah. I want you to prove to me that you've drank green tea recently. That is so dumb.
[6775.10s -> 6778.14s]  I apologize. Pull up my stream and I'll prove it to you right now that I'm a black tea guy.
[6778.14s -> 6783.72s]  That you're a black tea drinker? Hold on. I need to, um, I gotta, hold on a second.
[6783.72s -> 6791.08s]  Do you want to see where I'm getting down with? Um, what are you getting down with?
[6792.15s -> 6802.87s]  You see this? Pull this, pull this bad boy up. I gotta pull the stream. Why didn't it sign me out?
[6807.42s -> 6811.64s]  These are my mugs. Are you going to win here? Uh, yes.
[6814.44s -> 6817.80s]  Okay. What do you, what do you, I don't want to go over the game though. Let's see what you got.
[6817.80s -> 6823.43s]  Oh, you're good. You're good. I got to move it more towards, move it towards your right.
[6824.47s -> 6830.47s]  My right. My right. Wait, where are you sitting? I'm sitting. Why do you have, you're drinking
[6831.03s -> 6835.59s]  quad mug? I, yeah. Cause I like, so I have one tea, it's English breakfast, but then I
[6835.59s -> 6840.98s]  often drink throat goat, which is my other favorite tea. Dude, I thought you would do it.
[6840.98s -> 6843.70s]  That's how you were drinking it. Like you were holding it like that and taking sips out.
[6844.66s -> 6850.70s]  Yeah. And I like, I, I can just go for, I go for the whole, the big picture. I go around, you know?
[6850.70s -> 6856.62s]  Oh my God. I have to play the game. You focus. You've, I'm distracting you back to muting.
[6863.42s -> 6869.58s]  Am I doing a homina? Oh, why am I doing that? All right. You got this. You're nervous. You're
[6869.58s -> 6879.64s]  anxious. I was so, I want to see your tea. So do you not, do you like green? I like green tea.
[6879.64s -> 6887.34s]  It just doesn't have enough caffeine that I can, that I can justify. Yeah. No, I get it.
[6887.34s -> 6910.86s]  Still using a two, one bird. You know, this game is so cool. It really is so much fun. Um,
[6910.86s -> 6921.54s]  this is food. Okay. I mean, it's, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Is the lobster any good?
[6921.54s -> 6930.07s]  Lobster's terrible. One of the worst, I would say. You could also hit the fast forward button
[6930.07s -> 6936.68s]  during the fight and then you get more time to play. Oh, you do? Yeah. Cause it actually,
[6936.68s -> 6939.88s]  for whatever reason, cause the game already knows inherently what happens.
[6940.62s -> 6943.98s]  Oh, okay. So you get a little more time. Just starts the timer. It's kind of weird,
[6943.98s -> 6950.86s]  but. How'd you get a 19, 24 blowfish? I fed it a lot of pears. That skunk was a great decision.
[6950.86s -> 6956.97s]  Yep. That's what I was thinking. I think it's a narrow victory. Narrow.
[6964.49s -> 6974.62s]  Unfortunate. If I lose one more, I'm done. It is, it's a quick GG. Yeah, it would be a,
[6975.34s -> 6993.58s]  all right. This is where I really, really, where I really get involved here. What? What happened?
[6993.58s -> 6998.10s]  Why? Why did I have to think he's supposed to give us power? Wait, who did you pill? Don't
[6998.10s -> 7004.33s]  tell me you pulled something. I, I, oh, I sold it. I didn't pill it. Oops. I saw, I thought,
[7004.33s -> 7015.88s]  I thought selling did the same thing. I'm noticing this time crunch. I sold the best for you. I sold
[7015.88s -> 7021.16s]  the ant. I didn't kill the ant. I thought it was the same thing. Oh, this is bad. Hey, well,
[7021.16s -> 7024.76s]  I got pick Ross. You got super awesome. Hey, you know what? Come on. You gotta,
[7024.76s -> 7031.24s]  I gotta win one, right? It's my game. All right. All right. All right. All right. Hey,
[7031.24s -> 7036.49s]  it was an excellent bout. That was, this, this game's fun though. I like this game a lot.
[7036.49s -> 7041.50s]  Three to two German. You actually did inspire me in this game. I did your hedgehog shenanigans.
[7044.12s -> 7049.75s]  Oh yeah. You did like the head, the triple hedgehog, right? Uh huh. Yeah. Yeah. So we do
[7050.23s -> 7054.47s]  is that this one? Uh, it is say it again. That's a different pack.
[7055.43s -> 7060.31s]  Well, no, I would do another one. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's a, it's, yeah, it's your turn.
[7060.31s -> 7064.63s]  Your pick, your pick of a game. All right. Three to two and you have one game left. I believe
[7064.63s -> 7068.71s]  I do have one game left and I feel like it's going to be a bit. So it's the first person to get to
[7068.71s -> 7073.99s]  three wins, three, like game wins for five, five. Cause I'm at three right now. It's I'm at three.
[7073.99s -> 7082.31s]  You're at two. So house flipper is the last game that I have picked and we're going to need a
[7082.31s -> 7088.47s]  third party. Connor eats pants. DM me. Okay. He's ready, able, and willing for the cause.
[7089.19s -> 7095.02s]  So we're going to have to set a time limit. I think 15 is 15 too short. Maybe, maybe 30.
[7095.02s -> 7100.78s]  I would say at least at least 20 to 25 minutes. Well, let's do, I mean, I'm happy to do 30. I
[7100.78s -> 7105.18s]  think that that'd be probably best. It's a night still young. It's only five night is still young.
[7105.18s -> 7110.44s]  Congratulations on your super auto pets win. Thank you. Thank you. You know, I thought I'd
[7110.44s -> 7113.80s]  speed that up. So we have more time for house flipper. I mean, this is going to be great. I
[7113.80s -> 7118.33s]  feel like this is going to be, so have you played house flipper before? I have three hours in the
[7118.33s -> 7124.01s]  game. I watched Clint Stevens play it about four years ago and I played it too for about 40 viewers
[7124.01s -> 7129.30s]  and, uh, and that, and that's my history of house flipper. What's yours? I mean, this, I, this is
[7129.30s -> 7139.50s]  one of my top streamed games ever, ever more than like your numerous, numerous hours in blackjack.
[7139.50s -> 7144.15s]  No, I, I, this is one of my favorite games ever made. You've been discussing amount of hours in
[7144.15s -> 7147.69s]  blackjack. You know that, right? I have a lot. I would, I discussed things a little, I think a
[7147.69s -> 7153.13s]  little harsh, but gross it's like, it's like six to 7,000 hours. That's like this people play
[7153.13s -> 7160.02s]  league of legends for like 10,000 hours and not a big deal ripping in hours. All right. So you know
[7160.02s -> 7165.43s]  how to, there's not, okay. The competition here is who can make a cooler looking house, right? It's
[7165.43s -> 7171.43s]  not like gamer skills or anything. This is just like your design skills. This is like from the
[7171.43s -> 7176.31s]  heart. Yeah. Make something beautiful. I have a feeling that you're going to be pretty good on
[7176.31s -> 7181.30s]  this. I'm kind of hoping, but we'll see. So we have the third party that we're going to do a walk
[7181.30s -> 7186.41s]  through and they're going to pick which house is better, which house is better looking. We're well
[7186.41s -> 7194.84s]  designed, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The better house. So we need to pick a house that's small.
[7194.84s -> 7200.89s]  Yeah. We, we, let me see. I'm booting in right now. You got, you got, you, you are up to date here.
[7200.89s -> 7205.83s]  You got all your tools and money and everything. Uh, let me, let me double check. I should, right?
[7205.83s -> 7213.91s]  Cause I think I went offline mode, which was my one problem. Okay. That's a terrible start. Oh,
[7213.91s -> 7218.92s]  I can't believe that worked. It worked. All right. If I hit continue game, what happens?
[7222.60s -> 7231.66s]  How much money you got? 280,000. There you go. All right. So, and only my hand. You only have your
[7231.66s -> 7234.94s]  hand. Well, here you probably only have your hand. Well, no, if you hold down right click, you should
[7234.94s -> 7240.81s]  have pretty much everything. I'm seeing one big old hand. He just got the, he's just got the hand.
[7240.81s -> 7247.77s]  I added your files. Yeah. So you should have, should have all the tools here. You don't have
[7247.77s -> 7256.17s]  a flamethrower. Say it again. Let me go to the, let me go to the burned house and see if maybe
[7256.17s -> 7260.90s]  things are different. Maybe the abandoned house. Let me go to the abandoned house and see what's
[7260.90s -> 7268.23s]  going on over there. It might, it might take you a second or two to, you might have to do the
[7268.23s -> 7273.77s]  missions though, to unlock the tools, right? No, I know how to do this. I know how to, this
[7273.77s -> 7280.65s]  shouldn't take me more than 15 to 20 seconds max. Okay. So we need to pick a house that's small
[7280.65s -> 7286.30s]  that we can, it's not going to take us like two hours to do. Yes. What is your recommendation?
[7286.30s -> 7289.82s]  Where's your heart lead you? I would say if you go to, when you go to the laptop and you go to browse
[7290.46s -> 7298.02s]  like for purchase, we're talking about maybe the many generations house or the, um,
[7299.27s -> 7303.72s]  slightly larger. Do you want to go bigger? We can go bigger. No, that's, that's what I mean.
[7303.72s -> 7310.28s]  It's slightly larger. I was thinking abandoned or, or the burned house. A home admin legends
[7310.28s -> 7317.03s]  could be fine too. I think that's great. I'm down. Let's do the home admin legend. Home admin
[7317.03s -> 7327.10s]  legends. Yeah. Okay. Great. Great. Great. Great. Actually that might be too small. Let's do,
[7333.29s -> 7337.29s]  maybe the one to move into might be good. And now it's apartment. We're going to find like
[7337.29s -> 7343.34s]  one that's got enough that we can really design stuff in. I mean, this is like the breaking bad
[7343.34s -> 7351.48s]  house, right? The breaking bad house. Yeah, there's like, it's like a reference to breaking
[7351.48s -> 7360.36s]  bad. Um, what about the century old one? Not a contrived one. I think this, okay. This century
[7360.36s -> 7365.61s]  house, I think is where we're going to go here. That's big enough. It's got two floors, got a big
[7365.61s -> 7372.78s]  living area. I think this is good. I'm coming in hot. I'm coming in hot. This is surely worked.
[7377.00s -> 7381.08s]  And you're going to buy that house, the century old house, and then you're going to go there.
[7381.72s -> 7388.86s]  I'm not going to touch anything, by the way. Is this a Germanism? My chat just became German.
[7388.86s -> 7394.81s]  Wait, you just. Does that happen to you ever? Like you're reading German in your chat? Yeah,
[7394.81s -> 7400.90s]  it's everyone's speaking in German. What? I don't know if that's one of those German things. It's
[7400.90s -> 7408.66s]  like, ah, it's time to speak German, everybody. Not that I'm aware of. I hope that didn't start
[7408.66s -> 7417.75s]  it. Or did you change your language on like the little cog wheel? No, no. It's like it's
[7417.75s -> 7425.74s]  auto correcting. Yeah. No, they're just speaking good old fashioned German. Really? Okay. Interesting.
[7425.74s -> 7429.27s]  All right. All right. Let's see the house we're going with. By the way, I want to make this really
[7429.27s -> 7435.13s]  clear outside and inside. Outside and inside. Outside and inside. Be aware of that because
[7435.13s -> 7440.68s]  whoever, you know, Connor walks through, how's your yard look? How's your, how's the front door look?
[7440.68s -> 7445.69s]  Many Generations House. I think that's good. Many Generations, I think it's a good house.
[7449.10s -> 7455.66s]  Are we running that one? That's the one, yeah. I have not moved. All right. I don't think I
[7455.66s -> 7461.42s]  have many tools, but I also don't need many tools. What do you have? Okay. Do you have access to
[7461.42s -> 7476.39s]  painting, tiling, demolition, brush cutter? Brush cutter? So I got my hands and a good work ethic.
[7476.39s -> 7480.62s]  Wait, wrong house? Wait, there's a Many Generations House. What? Did I do the wrong house?
[7480.62s -> 7487.03s]  Oh, maybe I said that and that's not what it was. Oh, Ludwig said the wrong house. Oh. Oh,
[7487.03s -> 7493.18s]  I just said the wrong house and you disagreed with me. Oh, century old house. Is that, what did I say?
[7493.18s -> 7502.10s]  Uh, it is supposed to be the Many Generations. You need to be able to clean and stuff. Oh, look at
[7502.10s -> 7508.34s]  this. The turtle house. If you don't have access to your tools, you're not going to be able to do it.
[7508.34s -> 7513.38s]  I can clean everything. I can pick things up. Wait, which house is it?
[7513.38s -> 7519.62s]  Unless you have the specific mop, I don't think you can do it. Um, what was this house again?
[7519.62s -> 7525.67s]  Century old house. How expensive are we talking? Like a hundred thousand?
[7527.11s -> 7533.53s]  You're gonna run me out. Yeah, you might be able to go, I think you can go into your like config file
[7533.53s -> 7540.09s]  and give yourself all the tools. Yeah, that's what I was trying to do. Um. Yeah, I gave him my save,
[7540.09s -> 7547.78s]  but it won't, if for some reason the tools won't click. Century chat chat. Am I dumb? Is there a
[7547.78s -> 7560.92s]  house here? Am I just missing it? Century. Am I stupid? Let me see. Is this DLC? Oh, this might
[7560.92s -> 7567.50s]  be a DLC house. Okay. That changes things then. You have a DLC house. I own all the DLC for this
[7567.50s -> 7572.97s]  game. All right. So that might, yeah, that is DLC. It is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So let's do,
[7574.47s -> 7577.83s]  what, what do you have access to? What's like the biggest house you have access to?
[7577.91s -> 7584.97s]  Uh, the biggest house, the absolute largest is the house on the castle or the house on the moon.
[7584.97s -> 7589.53s]  Just married. Yeah. But the ones that I think would be good for this would be like the, like
[7589.53s -> 7595.67s]  I got a home in car, turtle house, you know, the boring house. That's a fun one because then you
[7595.67s -> 7603.51s]  have to spruce it up. One to flip the turtle. The turtle house is small though. But we only have 30
[7603.51s -> 7607.51s]  minutes. Is there, I mean. That's true. You're right. We don't have all day. Um, which one is
[7607.51s -> 7614.49s]  bigger? Turtle house or the one to flip? I think, do I have the one to flip? Well, yeah,
[7614.49s -> 7619.24s]  we'll do turtle. The turtle is very big, very easy. Um, I just, I'm concerned you don't have
[7619.24s -> 7625.58s]  access to tools and you won't let me, let me, let me get into it and then see, let me go there and
[7625.58s -> 7639.32s]  see. Okay. Yeah. Cause if you don't have access to the painting tool, then I mean, you can't paint
[7639.32s -> 7646.28s]  the walls. Yeah. All I can do is lift things and move them around. I'll just readjust where
[7646.28s -> 7651.22s]  everything cleaning not available yet. That's absurd. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I had it earlier.
[7651.22s -> 7655.70s]  There is, there's missions you can do that unlock all the tools, but it takes like 45 minutes.
[7657.70s -> 7662.18s]  That save file I gave you should work, but I don't know why it's not. It's supposed to work
[7662.18s -> 7666.66s]  in the sense that it's supposed to give you the tools. You're just supposed to have my save file
[7666.66s -> 7673.26s]  essentially. Right. Okay. Let me, hey, let me, let me give it one more. Is there a console here?
[7674.97s -> 7680.47s]  Oh, is there really? Okay. How do you enable console commands? Cause I used to do it with like
[7680.47s -> 7688.62s]  an INI file. Oh, you don't have the DLC. So the save won't work. Oh, that's what it is. Okay.
[7689.83s -> 7695.83s]  That makes sense. All right. Let me buy the DLC then either, either that or there's somebody's
[7695.83s -> 7705.75s]  people saying there's console commands that I don't necessarily go into your save game.
[7705.91s -> 7713.75s]  Press tilde and enter a press. What the fuck is that? Enter the code IDDQD. Leave the pause
[7713.75s -> 7723.51s]  screen. Cheats are now enabled to open console. Just press that like little tilde. Have you tried
[7723.51s -> 7728.14s]  this? I have not. I don't know what this is. Is that, is that, you're not like fucking around
[7728.14s -> 7735.02s]  with us, right? That actually works. I have to get all the DLCs. I would try the IDD. Let me try.
[7735.02s -> 7739.66s]  Let me try this guy. Let me try this guy. Am I just saying something out loud? That was like bad.
[7739.74s -> 7750.86s]  Five DLCs. Okay. Press tilde and enter the code in the game. Yeah. So I guess in the game,
[7750.86s -> 7758.42s]  do you, can you open up the dev console with the, um, I'm booting in. That's the fucking doom code.
[7758.42s -> 7765.27s]  Nevermind. Oh, it's a, it's a bit of a meme here. Yeah. I think, I think you are right that it's
[7765.27s -> 7770.46s]  through the system files. I know you can do it through the system files, but it might be a little
[7770.46s -> 7775.88s]  too much stumbling for this remainder of this afternoon here. Oh, there is a code though. If
[7775.88s -> 7786.62s]  you put in tilde, is there a code that you can, what's a good code? We have a few. No, no, no.
[7786.62s -> 7794.31s]  The IDDQ thing isn't fake. That's real. It's real. Why are people saying that was the doom code?
[7794.31s -> 7801.38s]  Okay. Google house flipper, unlock all tools command. Okay. I think, I think we're making
[7801.38s -> 7809.56s]  progress. Okay. Cool. Very cool. Now what I'm supposed to do is hit, um, she turned out and
[7809.56s -> 7814.36s]  able to open the console, press this in game. Oh, be careful. I was going to say be careful
[7814.36s -> 7822.66s]  opening the dev console. Oh, what happened? Nothing. You just worried me. Uh, and then
[7824.14s -> 7827.10s]  I'm saying, I don't know what, I don't know what it's going to show. Like I would just, I would,
[7827.10s -> 7831.74s]  I don't know. Who knows? Right, right, right. If I hit, apparently if I have this code and then I hit
[7831.74s -> 7838.94s]  F three, I get all the tools and then if I hit F five, I get all the money. Oh,
[7839.42s -> 7848.15s]  Oh, all right. We're in business eight improves all the tools. Oh, that's great.
[7849.16s -> 7854.94s]  Are we in business? Oh, we're in business. We are. I have everything now. All right. Awesome.
[7854.94s -> 7859.59s]  Perfect. So, um, so let me give you a quick little rundown of house flipper. So you see,
[7859.59s -> 7863.75s]  you have a grid. You have, it should be like, uh, it looks like the house is on bricks and a
[7863.75s -> 7869.27s]  foundation. It's like a 10 by 10, sometimes 15 by 15, the grid on the foundation. And you'll see
[7869.27s -> 7876.50s]  this numbers that correspond to where you need to place your tiling. And if you see on the left
[7876.50s -> 7880.97s]  side, there's like a four, a three, and a, and a two, you need, there has to be at least one tile
[7880.97s -> 7886.20s]  on the ground. All right, let's just go before I embarrass myself anymore. Um, okay. Yeah.
[7886.20s -> 7891.16s]  Understood. Noted. Noted. All right. So timer starts, timer starts now. Or you actually know
[7891.16s -> 7893.96s]  how to play it. Cause like, there's like a specific stupid shit that you like need to,
[7893.96s -> 7897.96s]  like, you have to clean with the mop. You can't like use your hands. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No.
[7897.96s -> 7904.30s]  Hey, me. I come on talking to Mr. House flipper. I'm excited. I'm really all right. So you need to
[7904.30s -> 7910.20s]  make this look as dazzling and beautiful as possible. Connor's coming in. Bingo. You want
[7910.20s -> 7915.24s]  to come in and he wants the best house possible. Okay. You let's, let's get it. Let's get to it.
[7915.24s -> 7922.73s]  Timer starts now. Good luck. Goodbye. Okay. Here we go. First of all, get rid of this shit.
[7922.73s -> 7926.97s]  We're going to cut this grass. He's going to forget about the fucking lawn and mine's going
[7926.97s -> 7932.28s]  to look incredible. He is going to completely neglect and completely forget the lawn.
[7933.16s -> 7937.38s]  Connor's going to look over and he's going to be like, this is disgustingly ugly.
[7938.18s -> 7950.84s]  By the way, Connor, Connor, I hope you're going to be very, very, um, thorough. What was that?
[7955.75s -> 7964.60s]  Okay. That looks all right. Make sure nothing around the back. That was a dragon ball.
[7966.33s -> 7975.08s]  Why? Yeah. He's going to go in there and look, Ludwig is going to have a 10 minute debacle where
[7975.08s -> 7979.51s]  he can't figure out what kind of couch he's picking while his lawn is uncut. Do this first.
[7983.98s -> 7989.51s]  I don't give a shit about couch. All an interior really is, is like the accent walls
[7990.15s -> 7994.15s]  and a chandelier and you, wow. Wait, I can't, I can't stop talking. Connor might be watching.
[8002.70s -> 8008.54s]  Connor can't watch these three. He needs to be completely, he needs to not know anything.
[8009.18s -> 8020.81s]  Hey, it looks good. No weeds, right? Right here. Get rid of that. I'm going to plant a couple of
[8020.81s -> 8028.09s]  trees. I'm telling you, he's going to, he is going to neglect the fuck out of his front outside
[8029.46s -> 8037.43s]  garden. Oh my God. And I'm going to be a streamer in there. Plants. Let's go. Let's go. How about
[8037.43s -> 8065.80s]  let's something, um, let's do these. Oh yeah. Let's go. Look at that. Already perfect. Not bad.
[8065.80s -> 8076.81s]  Can I extend this out a little bit with some gravel? We need, uh, outside. We need floor.
[8076.89s -> 8085.74s]  We need outside shit to go. Floor coverings. I knew I just want, I just want stone. I want,
[8085.74s -> 8106.07s]  I want crushed stone. Where is crushed stone? Stone. Where's crushed stone? Where is it? It's
[8106.07s -> 8119.22s]  like, where is it? What the fuck? They're not going to fucking, they're not going to tell the
[8119.22s -> 8128.07s]  difference. So who cares? Cobblestone. Here it is. Delete that. Delete that. Delete that. Delete
[8128.07s -> 8147.62s]  that. Why am I fucking Santa Claus? All right. I just want a little bit more of a bedazzle.
[8152.44s -> 8162.49s]  It's all about first impressions. I'm going to put like a nice thing of flowers here,
[8162.49s -> 8182.55s]  right there. It's a first impression. Okay. That's all right. Line that with flowers.
[8182.55s -> 8193.16s]  I need to like delete this. Let's take care of the outside, the paint on the outside. Hold on.
[8193.72s -> 8201.29s]  All right. Maybe something funky, right? Something funky. Somebody said Connor is too dumb to notice
[8201.29s -> 8217.37s]  that. Connor is like an incredibly intelligent young man. Okay. Um, excuse me. All right. What's
[8217.37s -> 8222.09s]  something that's, that doesn't scream? I'm trying too hard to make the judge like me,
[8222.09s -> 8227.05s]  but it's, but it's, but it's pizzazzy enough where it's going to stand out. I'm going to say
[8227.05s -> 8233.72s]  the outside of the house is going to be fresh morning. This thing right here, a fresh morning.
[8236.22s -> 8251.00s]  How's that look? I don't like it. No, it's all right. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Is it
[8251.00s -> 8257.02s]  fine? It's fine. That is it. Is that an awful color? I can't tell. What's Connor's favorite
[8257.02s -> 8261.58s]  color? Does anybody know? Who here watches Connor's stream regularly? What's his favorite
[8261.58s -> 8270.86s]  color? I'm going to say it's probably like blue, right? Just put all of Connor's favorite things
[8270.86s -> 8278.44s]  in the house. Like just have them on tables and shit. Is it blue? Okay. Yeah. We're going blue.
[8278.44s -> 8289.93s]  We're going fucking like bright blue. Uh, paint. Blue. But isn't that wicked ugly?
[8295.50s -> 8303.22s]  Oh, that's right. He does. He loves Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm playing to,
[8304.18s -> 8311.29s]  I'm playing to a strength here. He loves Sonic the Hedgehog. I remember, yeah, we took an Uber
[8311.29s -> 8316.49s]  together at the streamer awards. I remember he had, um, headphones in like, uh, AirPods
[8317.62s -> 8321.30s]  and he was just like sitting there like fucking going like this, like pumping himself up and
[8321.30s -> 8325.38s]  just like hanging out. And we were like, oh shit. And all you could hear was like blasting in his
[8325.38s -> 8340.92s]  ears. It was like Sonic heroes. I was like, that's a good song. That's based. Oh yeah. That's what
[8340.92s -> 8355.64s]  I'm saying. I got to get up higher. This house is fucking ugly. I'm really curious what he is
[8355.64s -> 8362.30s]  doing over there. I can't wait to find out. This is what a fun, I, this is a guy like this idea
[8362.30s -> 8368.38s]  is he gives up, you give two people like 30 minutes to like 40 minutes to flip a house
[8368.38s -> 8380.57s]  and then somebody, a third party has to come in. I love that. This is fun. I like this a lot.
[8380.57s -> 8395.21s]  I think we're going to be time efficient here. I know he's going to neglect so much shit.
[8395.21s -> 8398.89s]  He's probably like walking around with a flame thrower, like laughing, right? Like he's going to
[8398.89s -> 8402.25s]  have to be. That's what I did when I first got the flamethrower. He didn't have the flamethrower
[8402.25s -> 8414.33s]  before. No way. And look, you might be thinking I'm wasting time on the exterior. I don't think so.
[8414.33s -> 8423.46s]  The interior is easy. It's out here. The first impression that matters the absolute most.
[8423.46s -> 8436.01s]  I need to get a scaffolding. This is going to take like, this is going to take the whole time.
[8442.60s -> 8446.47s]  How long have we been doing this for? You're wasting time. How long, how long,
[8446.47s -> 8460.30s]  how much longer do I have? Nine minutes? What do you mean nine minutes? I have 20. It's okay.
[8460.30s -> 8466.87s]  It's been okay. I have 20 minutes. That's plenty of time to get in there. And we'll shit up a
[8466.87s -> 8484.50s]  little bit. Get these delete the rocks. I have unlimited money. So who cares? Also huge tip.
[8484.50s -> 8490.54s]  I got to get rid of these paint cans and shit because that's an eyesore. That's a big problem.
[8490.54s -> 8496.62s]  And I don't think Ludwig's going to do that. All like the debris and shit that you die. Yeah.
[8496.62s -> 8511.37s]  I'm not going to leave this crap everywhere. All right. I need scaffolding at this part out of the
[8511.37s -> 8531.30s]  way first. I'm going to sell it. Don't worry. I'm not going to be an idiot. Why am I even putting
[8531.30s -> 8541.77s]  them around here? It's only the front. Oh my God. Just go. I think I can get up. I can stand up
[8541.77s -> 8545.53s]  there. All right. All right. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go. I need paint cans up there.
[8545.53s -> 8570.14s]  What is make house? How do I get rid of that? How do I get, how do I delete this?
[8572.71s -> 8589.77s]  Make house? I'm making it. How do I, I can't sell it. Let's do this then. Turkey. Um,
[8590.33s -> 8626.02s]  I don't think that fits there, but hold on. Oh shit. Yeah, I think so.
[8629.78s -> 8639.21s]  Oh, all right. All right. Keep going. Keep going. All I need is five minutes in the house.
[8639.21s -> 8661.77s]  10 minutes in the house. Get up. I got to get rid of these ugly marks here. Sell these. I
[8661.77s -> 8674.41s]  can work clean up as I go. It's good. Clean up as you go. Don't fuck around. I got to get rid of
[8674.41s -> 8682.73s]  the how you doing. That's so awful. That looks good. Almost ready. All right. We're good.
[8682.73s -> 8696.63s]  Exterior is almost done. And as you go, now leave the rocks. It's aesthetic. I need lamps,
[8696.63s -> 8700.63s]  lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, quick, quick, quick, quick. Something cool. Um,
[8701.66s -> 8709.06s]  outdoor, outdoor lamps, lights that lead in. Cool looking lamps, cool LEDs or something. Strips.
[8709.06s -> 8714.89s]  Yep. Okay. LED strip two meters. High intensity. These are going to be, I mean,
[8714.89s -> 8735.37s]  he loves something like the hedgehog. Why can't I put it down? These aren't bright.
[8739.96s -> 8743.32s]  That doesn't even look that bad. All right. Hold on. I need a little bit more life out here.
[8756.34s -> 8766.66s]  Um, I need plants. Wait, no. What are these? What are these? Hold on.
[8767.30s -> 8789.21s]  Hold on. I need to put, Oh my God. What are these? Just playing the fiddle. This looks like a
[8789.21s -> 8797.94s]  fucking G mod house. Okay. Okay. Okay. I need plants. I need plants, plants, plants, plants,
[8798.66s -> 8813.50s]  plants and lights, circus table lamp, whatever. Okay. This is going to be this color. How do I
[8813.50s -> 8839.50s]  turn them on? Turn them on. Holy shit. Cool. All right. I need a, I need plants. I got to,
[8840.76s -> 8843.96s]  I'll get to put a sauna in the fucking house. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[8843.96s -> 8846.92s]  All right. I got to go inside. Go fuck it. We're doing a sauna. We're going to have a whole sauna
[8846.92s -> 8864.01s]  in here. Oh my God. It's so dirty. It's so dirty in here. Get rid of all this fucking bullshit.
[8872.84s -> 8883.96s]  I don't want to use the dragon balls to get this out of here. All right. This is the sauna. This
[8883.96s -> 8901.00s]  is the sauna. Okay. Here we go. I don't want this thing. Get it out of here. The dragon balls in
[8901.00s -> 8906.52s]  here, I guess. I don't know. Okay. Clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean,
[8906.52s -> 8914.04s]  clean, clean. I would probably like the dragon balls. Yeah, I can display them later. I only
[8914.04s -> 8928.65s]  have like 16 minutes. Hey, can we do an extension? Can we do like a 10 minute extension?
[8928.65s -> 8931.94s]  Feeling a little stressed over there? I just, there's a lot I want to do.
[8931.94s -> 8936.58s]  You know, I'll grant 40 minutes, 40 minutes in. Okay. So we got an extra 10 minutes.
[8936.58s -> 8941.91s]  Yeah. 10 minutes. That's good. That's good. That sounds good. Good luck.
[8941.91s -> 8946.28s]  I know it's a Christmas tree. I just heard that you're doing a Christmas theme.
[8946.28s -> 8956.52s]  He's doing Christmas theme. What a mistake. Christmas in fucking January? What is it?
[8956.60s -> 8964.66s]  Christmas in March? Big mistake. I'm just going to see right through that. I know him. All right,
[8964.66s -> 8977.56s]  let's go. Let's go. Sauna. The walls of a sauna are wood. This has to be done first. Wood panels.
[8977.56s -> 8996.79s]  Here we go. That looks good. Handling. Let's go for it. It's wood on the ground too. I can't
[8996.79s -> 9011.80s]  wait to present this. Could there be a toilet in the sauna? Like it's my version of a sauna,
[9011.80s -> 9026.31s]  right? Should it be like a toilet? What do you guys think? Maybe? It's possible. There's that.
[9026.31s -> 9030.55s]  The floor is already wood, but I want, I want a different wood. I want like a nicer,
[9030.55s -> 9055.29s]  more pristine looking wood. Let's go for sauna. This is a sauna plus shower. I need plumbing,
[9055.29s -> 9080.25s]  right? Wait, that's not correct. Oh, here we go. Sauna door. You got to build these walls again.
[9085.40s -> 9099.05s]  It's already so loud. I'm sorry. Hey, there's the sauna door. Okay. I need a light in here.
[9103.98s -> 9109.02s]  Um, like a lamp. Lights. Yeah. Lights. Okay. Something hanging just like a wall lamp.
[9109.02s -> 9139.59s]  Ooh, this looks nice. I turn it on. I need a light switch. Elegant light switch. Ooh, nice. Very,
[9139.59s -> 9153.32s]  very swanky in here. Very swanky. I like it. Okay. Sauna. Sauna sand timer. Okay. Sauna bench.
[9153.32s -> 9170.02s]  Here's the sauna heater. It goes like right here. Yeah. Cause it goes like, shh. Now I need, yeah,
[9170.02s -> 9185.54s]  sauna bucket with a ladle. Put that there for now. How do I spell this? Oh my God. How do you spell
[9185.62s -> 9208.12s]  sauna? Sauna? Swan? What's going on? What's happening? What happened? Sauna. That's how
[9208.12s -> 9221.56s]  I was spelling it the whole time. Okay. Bench. Make it a little bit darker. There. We're going to do,
[9221.56s -> 9232.49s]  we're going to have to go across the back wall here. Very nice. Oh, this is so cool. Ludwig
[9232.49s -> 9237.93s]  does not have a sauna. Don't fucking leak this by the way. I'd be pissed if you do. I'd be really
[9237.93s -> 9246.73s]  mad. He's going to be like sauna. Don't like seriously. I don't even know who this is.
[9248.41s -> 9271.10s]  No, I don't want that. Sauna. Okay. Oh my fucking God. Head lift. Okay. There we go.
[9271.10s -> 9289.53s]  So I can like lie down at either end. Very nice. Almost done. Corner bench. Sauna sand timer.
[9290.17s -> 9325.50s]  Sauna lamp. That's better. Okay. There's your sauna. Sauna's done. Wait, I need a bench. I
[9325.50s -> 9332.89s]  need like a stool to put this on. Like right next to it. Like right here. Right there. The
[9332.89s -> 9344.78s]  bucket's got to go here. Take a look at that. Why is the lights off? Is your sauna? It's dark in
[9344.78s -> 9355.05s]  here. All right. Those lights are actually, I might move them, but they're okay. Wall. Yep. You got it.

[9384.39s -> 9396.04s]  one here. Beautiful. Beautiful. Yep. I got to get some kind of decoration in here too, right?
[9396.60s -> 9401.77s]  Ceiling's got to be wood. All right. I need, I need a better floor than that. Much better.
[9401.77s -> 9420.62s]  Floor panels. Please. Yeah. That's a sauna. That's what they look like. Yeah. That's what it's,
[9420.62s -> 9428.34s]  this is a sauna. You get in here, you go shh. Ceiling. Uh, I need to paint the ceiling brown.
[9428.34s -> 9445.18s]  Can I even do the ceiling? Coffee. Cocoa. I guess this one. I don't think I can paint the ceiling.
[9445.18s -> 9461.48s]  Oh my god, dude. Come on. Dude, I can't paint the fucking ceiling brown. Um, how do I do this?
[9464.20s -> 9475.99s]  Why is it so dark in here? I need more lights. What the fuck? What is this? Oh my god. We need
[9475.99s -> 9479.91s]  more time. All right. All right. Speed it up. Speed it up. Walls. I need lamps in the corners.
[9479.91s -> 9490.31s]  Lamps. Now. Lamps. Uh, all right. This one's, that's enough. It's kind of like an old lady house.
[9490.31s -> 9518.68s]  This is very galactic, I think. It's ugly. I don't like it. Maybe one. Oh, it makes too many
[9518.68s -> 9522.92s]  shadows everywhere. Looks like there's spider webs all over your house. That thing sucks.
[9522.92s -> 9549.37s]  Something else. This is, I like that. This one's good. Brass. No, I hate brass. I don't want brass.
[9549.37s -> 9567.66s]  Okay, cool. We're doing, um, ouch. Just go in here. Living room here. We separated by wall.
[9569.99s -> 9578.06s]  Uh, and the wall is going to be, the door is going to be here. No, like yeah, here. Right here. It's
[9578.06s -> 9582.20s]  three, right? It's a three or four. I think it's three. You only have six minutes.

[9720.49s -> 9728.52s]  But what kind of color do I want here? Okay. I'm thinking the white. I'm thinking black and white.
[9729.08s -> 9747.94s]  Get this out of here. Perfect fit. Is this the wrong way? I got to flip this. It's the wrong way.
[9750.18s -> 9754.74s]  You get an order to make this in somebody's house and you build it the fucking wrong direction.
[9755.30s -> 9765.24s]  That's got to be flush. Connor is going to be very detailed. Nice. Good. I mean, if a fridge

[9834.04s -> 9851.43s]  This is too big. Oh fuck. That's too big. It's a ping pong table. Countess table.
[9854.17s -> 9863.38s]  That's a detail that somebody will overlook. That's cutting board. How about like a round table?
[9863.38s -> 9882.09s]  Round table auto. Oh my God. Perfect. These are so uncomfortable looking. This is just every chair
[9882.09s -> 9889.70s]  that a dark souls NPC sits in that you pick an item up off of. Uh, come on something quick.
[9890.34s -> 9905.75s]  These are fine. That's whatever. It doesn't matter. The windows right there. You can get a big fresh

[9949.00s -> 9963.26s]  extension? You think? Oh, we're running out of time. We're running out of time. Quickly, quickly,

[9977.45s -> 10003.77s]  It says what? That's a fucking dog bed. That's fine. Um, TV. I need a huge TV. 85 inch TV.
[10003.77s -> 10016.62s]  Okay. How do you get into the, it's, I don't, just wait. I, we have to put stuff down. Carpets.
[10021.99s -> 10047.21s]  Hmm. I need carpeting. Floor, floor coverings. Um, my God, hurry the fuck up. It looks so like

[10171.14s -> 10182.47s]  Oh, that's so boring and plain. Something else. Quick. Fuck. Oh no. This is bad.
[10182.47s -> 10205.77s]  Fresh carrots. It's a kitchen. This is why we do the exterior first because this is going to look

[10406.47s -> 10415.38s]  there so much fucking plumbing in here? That's so ugly. What? I don't even know what's supposed
[10415.38s -> 10420.01s]  to be in here. TV room? Oh, this is just a lounge room. This is the relax room to get out of the
[10420.01s -> 10448.86s]  bedroom. You need a sink? Oh my God. Get this fucking thing out of the way. It's good enough.
[10448.86s -> 10473.50s]  Throw the paper. Oh, I got it. We good? Hey, German. Hey. Yeah. I was wondering if you wanted
[10473.50s -> 10479.10s]  to wrap up in a bit. How you're feeling? I know it's been stressful. Do you want to wrap maybe
[10479.10s -> 10485.98s]  like another, what is it? Two minutes left. 43, 30 is on my clock. Maybe 45, 30. Oh, how are you
[10485.98s -> 10490.62s]  doing? Do you think you want an extra two or three minutes? I mean, I've been done for like a little
[10490.62s -> 10495.50s]  bit here, but I'm happy. All right. No, we can call it right there. You call it right now? Oh,
[10495.50s -> 10502.26s]  yeah. That sounds good. Right now. Yeah. Yeah. We can call it right now. I think that's it.
[10503.98s -> 10513.83s]  You know what? Hey, let's just be gentle about this. Let's call it. Let's just call it. So you
[10513.83s -> 10521.88s]  want to call it? Build? Oh, yeah. We can say the build is ready. Is your build ready for? Oh,
[10521.88s -> 10528.28s]  yeah. Yeah. I think my build is ready to have a peek at it. Oh, he's stalling. Okay. I get it.
[10528.28s -> 10532.20s]  No, I'm not stalling. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. I need to sink. Okay.
[10532.20s -> 10540.84s]  I'm here and ready to go. Question. All right. So you got to start from outside the house,
[10540.84s -> 10548.41s]  standing where the beach is. Right. And we're going to have Connor, he can open up each one
[10548.41s -> 10554.63s]  of our streams and bring him in this call. And we will individually do a nice slow walkthrough
[10554.63s -> 10563.27s]  of our property. And from there, Connor can decide who has the better designed house.
[10564.52s -> 10567.80s]  I think that sounds excellent to me. And pencils down, by the way.
[10568.84s -> 10572.44s]  Right now? Pencils down? Pencils down. What about one plumbing system, though?
[10573.64s -> 10577.48s]  Pencils down. Pencils down. Pencils down. Pencils down. I don't need another pencil.
[10577.48s -> 10581.46s]  You don't need any more. You don't have to sharpen it. We're good.
[10581.46s -> 10585.86s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Pencils down. I'm outside my house. I'm ready to go.
[10585.86s -> 10589.58s]  All right. I'll bring Connor on the call. Do we want to do yours first or mine first?
[10589.58s -> 10595.18s]  Let's do a tour of... Let's do mine. I made you go first earlier. We can do mine if you'd like.
[10595.18s -> 10599.37s]  Let me open your stream. Okay. I'll Discord screen share if that's easier for you.
[10600.57s -> 10605.53s]  Hey, guys. Connor, one second. Just give me one. I need some water. I'm a little anxious. Give me water.
[10605.53s -> 10611.13s]  Yeah, I got your stream. I got it. Is he okay? I think he's okay.
[10611.13s -> 10613.69s]  He's very nervous, it sounds. I haven't heard him like that in a long time.
[10615.02s -> 10617.82s]  What's up, dude? I'm doing good. I'm ready to judge.
[10619.10s -> 10622.86s]  I'm just... I'm so ready. I'm actually... I'm kind of nervous too, if I'm honest.
[10623.90s -> 10625.10s]  You all right? I don't know.
[10627.46s -> 10629.70s]  I'll just go. What's like online?
[10632.44s -> 10637.48s]  For this entire contest, if he loses, he has to play Smite on stream. And if I lose,
[10637.48s -> 10640.66s]  I have to play ToonTown. Oh.
[10642.74s -> 10645.14s]  Oh, okay. Discord stream sharing if you prefer.
[10645.14s -> 10650.42s]  Connor, do you know what you're doing here? Yeah, I have to figure out how to turn you up.
[10650.42s -> 10652.98s]  I don't know how to work audio. Audio's dumb.
[10654.58s -> 10663.69s]  Yeah, basically, Connor is here as our representative who will be judging which house
[10663.69s -> 10671.64s]  is the best based off the constraints given, the house we had, and the time given.
[10672.36s -> 10676.84s]  Your job is to come in here and just complete independent third party.
[10676.84s -> 10684.52s]  We're going to give you a walkthrough of both houses and you are to determine who's is better.
[10684.52s -> 10686.12s]  Sounds good. Does two minutes on the
[10686.12s -> 10690.95s]  clock for a walkthrough sound fair to you, Jerma? Do I watch a stream or am I able to like do it
[10690.95s -> 10693.99s]  and like do I have to boot up my own house? I think a solid three minutes.
[10693.99s -> 10698.09s]  Three minutes. Three minutes sounds great. I'm Discord screen sharing, but also my stream,
[10698.09s -> 10701.21s]  it's up to you. I imagine Discord screen sharing might be a bit easier.
[10701.29s -> 10707.05s]  Yeah, I'll just I'll cover Ludwig's face with my face because your audio is delayed
[10707.05s -> 10713.40s]  because I'm watching your stream. And if I can start, can I go or
[10713.40s -> 10715.96s]  let me know when you're ready, Connor? OK, I'm ready.
[10715.96s -> 10719.51s]  All right, let me let me get my timer set a timer for three minutes.
[10723.27s -> 10731.78s]  Connor, welcome our house, which we've called Relax.
[10732.58s -> 10737.35s]  As you can see, when you walk in, there's an accent wall, two accent walls, in fact,
[10737.35s -> 10741.27s]  because I wanted to I wanted it to be like a like a dream house.
[10741.27s -> 10745.27s]  Right. This to make you remember what it was like being young.
[10745.27s -> 10748.55s]  You know, oh, so let's let's actually head down walking in.
[10748.55s -> 10750.79s]  I don't want to reveal too much. We look to our right.
[10750.79s -> 10755.35s]  You can see we have a television, a nice reminds me of my dad couch.
[10755.35s -> 10756.87s]  Yeah. Yeah. You might notice the gun.
[10758.22s -> 10763.50s]  We just like a little bit of safety, I guess a little bit of safety will turn here.
[10763.50s -> 10765.66s]  And we have some nice bonsai trees
[10766.62s -> 10770.95s]  just to decompress and and we'll keep moving over.
[10770.95s -> 10772.63s]  Here's the kitchen area.
[10772.63s -> 10774.87s]  Now, again, turn off the flashlight.
[10774.87s -> 10775.67s]  Oh, sorry. Yeah.
[10776.71s -> 10778.31s]  Oh, yeah. There's like a big like resident.
[10779.75s -> 10782.15s]  My bad. Sorry. I'm so stressed.
[10782.15s -> 10782.79s]  Here you go.
[10782.79s -> 10784.31s]  This is the kitchen. This is the kitchen.
[10784.31s -> 10787.19s]  Very pink themed. Again, very, very relaxed base.
[10787.19s -> 10790.07s]  So we have our fridge here. We have our microwave.
[10790.07s -> 10792.23s]  Right. This is, you know, but but but also.
[10792.23s -> 10793.51s]  Hold on. OK, wait a minute.
[10793.51s -> 10796.63s]  Why is the microwave just like on like a children's table?
[10796.63s -> 10798.63s]  It's because we actually have a really short
[10799.75s -> 10800.71s]  member living in this house.
[10800.71s -> 10803.43s]  Also, I don't know why I pointed out that it was on the children's table,
[10803.43s -> 10806.23s]  not that there is a pistol sitting on the microwave.
[10806.23s -> 10807.27s]  Safety is key.
[10807.27s -> 10810.95s]  So we have this as our main kitchenette area.
[10810.95s -> 10812.15s]  There's a stove, a sink.
[10812.87s -> 10813.91s]  We'll ignore that.
[10813.91s -> 10816.15s]  Now, let's move over to the bathroom.
[10816.15s -> 10818.95s]  So we have his and hers.
[10818.95s -> 10820.87s]  Hey, you're breathtaking.
[10821.51s -> 10823.35s]  You stand up here in PTV, of course.
[10824.07s -> 10827.83s]  And then hers, it's, you know, it's a little more like that.
[10827.83s -> 10828.95s]  It's a good girl toilet.
[10828.95s -> 10834.39s]  But it also has safety considerations because I understand this is a turret.
[10834.39s -> 10837.11s]  I understand that it's it's it's it's it's scarier.
[10837.11s -> 10837.43s]  It's scary.
[10837.43s -> 10838.87s]  Women have been asking for that.
[10838.87s -> 10842.79s]  They've been like they've been asking for like solutions to the problems, you know.
[10844.63s -> 10845.75s]  Where's the wall?
[10845.75s -> 10846.95s]  Do you like streaming, Connor?
[10846.95s -> 10848.17s]  It's open floor pan.
[10848.17s -> 10849.05s]  I think I do.
[10849.05s -> 10850.25s]  I enjoy it.
[10850.25s -> 10852.82s]  Check this out.
[10852.82s -> 10853.70s]  Whoa.
[10853.70s -> 10856.58s]  It is the ultimate stream room.
[10856.58s -> 10858.18s]  We have everything.
[10858.18s -> 10859.46s]  3080 in there.
[10859.46s -> 10862.26s]  We got at maximum GPU.
[10862.26s -> 10863.14s]  That is a while.
[10863.14s -> 10865.06s]  That's like that's like Han Solo's chair.
[10865.06s -> 10867.86s]  I'm like, hey, someone ate my sandwich.
[10867.86s -> 10869.22s]  Oh, right.
[10869.22s -> 10871.14s]  Yeah, you got a clock.
[10871.14s -> 10872.26s]  Is that like the like street?
[10872.26s -> 10873.70s]  Like did he say that like the stream?
[10873.70s -> 10874.66s]  Yeah, yeah.
[10874.66s -> 10875.94s]  It's like the streamer thing.
[10875.94s -> 10876.50s]  It's famous.
[10876.50s -> 10878.18s]  Like someone ate my sandwich.
[10878.18s -> 10878.42s]  Yeah.
[10878.42s -> 10880.10s]  So he starts the stream like that.
[10880.10s -> 10880.58s]  He goes.
[10880.58s -> 10880.90s]  Yeah.
[10880.90s -> 10883.30s]  Oh, guys, somebody my sandwich.
[10883.30s -> 10884.66s]  I think everybody.
[10884.66s -> 10885.78s]  Yeah, you get it.
[10885.78s -> 10886.18s]  I get it.
[10886.82s -> 10889.46s]  And so and that's what are these little orange orbs on the floor?
[10889.46s -> 10890.18s]  I've seen them around.
[10890.18s -> 10892.42s]  There's like what are those guys?
[10892.42s -> 10893.38s]  You didn't clean them up.
[10893.38s -> 10894.10s]  Oh, these guys.
[10894.10s -> 10897.78s]  No, actually, they're accent orbs.
[10897.78s -> 10900.26s]  They're accent accent accent orbs.
[10900.26s -> 10902.36s]  Yeah, it's a European thing.
[10902.36s -> 10903.32s]  Well, time's up.
[10903.32s -> 10904.52s]  Don't ask any more questions.
[10905.24s -> 10908.20s]  Anyway, that concludes the tour of our house.
[10908.20s -> 10909.48s]  Dragon Balls is what they are.
[10909.48s -> 10909.96s]  Excuse me.
[10910.52s -> 10911.48s]  They're Dragon Balls.
[10911.48s -> 10914.36s]  Yeah, I didn't want to get DMCA's striked, but they're Dragon Balls.
[10914.36s -> 10915.80s]  This is like on like an island.
[10915.80s -> 10918.84s]  Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's like cats out of the bag.
[10918.84s -> 10922.68s]  It's similar to Kamei's house in Dragon Ball.
[10922.68s -> 10923.32s]  So.
[10923.32s -> 10924.92s]  Oh, oh, OK.
[10924.92s -> 10925.72s]  It was a pretty good house.
[10925.72s -> 10926.36s]  It was OK.
[10926.36s -> 10927.32s]  It was neat.
[10927.88s -> 10928.44s]  That was it.
[10928.44s -> 10928.92s]  That was it.
[10928.92s -> 10932.28s]  That was that was the Maison de Résistance.
[10932.28s -> 10933.56s]  Pièce de Résistance.
[10933.56s -> 10934.92s]  You know, I don't speak that.
[10934.92s -> 10937.54s]  You got to you got to like like what does that mean?
[10937.54s -> 10938.74s]  It's my house, my house.
[10938.74s -> 10939.30s]  Oh, OK.
[10939.30s -> 10940.02s]  Yeah, it's your house.
[10940.02s -> 10940.74s]  I get it.
[10940.74s -> 10941.62s]  Complicated.
[10942.26s -> 10944.18s]  Jerma, what's your what?
[10944.18s -> 10944.82s]  What do you work with?
[10944.82s -> 10945.70s]  I am ready.
[10945.70s -> 10946.58s]  All right, you do.
[10946.58s -> 10947.70s]  Connor, you do you have my stream?
[10947.70s -> 10949.38s]  Oh, I got to put this in.
[10949.38s -> 10949.86s]  Yeah, hold on.
[10949.86s -> 10951.91s]  I'll pull up the live stream.
[10951.91s -> 10953.67s]  One of the old live streaming.
[10954.55s -> 10955.19s]  All right.
[10955.19s -> 10955.91s]  Not live.
[10955.91s -> 10956.47s]  You want to do.
[10957.03s -> 10957.51s]  Look, what do you have?
[10957.51s -> 10958.07s]  You have a timer.
[10958.07s -> 10958.71s]  You can set.
[10958.71s -> 10959.11s]  All right.
[10959.11s -> 10959.91s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10959.91s -> 10964.25s]  Hey, Siri, set a timer for two minutes and 58 seconds.
[10964.25s -> 10966.31s]  I just I started a little late.
[10966.31s -> 10966.55s]  All right.
[10966.55s -> 10967.19s]  You're good to go.
[10967.19s -> 10968.46s]  OK, here we go.
[10968.46s -> 10969.02s]  Connor, hi.
[10969.02s -> 10969.98s]  Welcome to the house.
[10969.98s -> 10970.86s]  The first I like.
[10970.86s -> 10973.42s]  I like the Christmas like price gun.
[10973.42s -> 10974.06s]  Exactly.
[10974.06s -> 10974.70s]  First of all.
[10974.70s -> 10975.18s]  Right.
[10975.18s -> 10976.30s]  Points already.
[10976.30s -> 10978.14s]  So as you notice, we're on the beach.
[10978.14s -> 10979.34s]  We don't have to spend too much time in that.
[10979.34s -> 10982.86s]  But as you see, I have a nice cobblestone walkway
[10982.86s -> 10986.38s]  leading towards two relics that have been lit up pretty well.
[10986.38s -> 10988.94s]  Those are very, very, very, very expensive bronze statues.
[10990.38s -> 10991.64s]  How are you doing?
[10991.64s -> 10993.80s]  You know, it's such a thing that we ask every time somebody.
[10993.80s -> 10995.24s]  It's like it's like welcoming.
[10995.24s -> 10997.16s]  Like, you know, you know what it's about.
[10997.16s -> 10998.52s]  So we're feeding into him a little bit.
[10998.52s -> 11001.16s]  We want people to come in and tell us how they're doing.
[11001.16s -> 11001.40s]  Right.
[11001.40s -> 11002.44s]  And hopefully we're doing well.
[11003.24s -> 11005.72s]  I've got a cool a painting of I don't know.
[11005.72s -> 11006.60s]  I don't know who that is.
[11006.60s -> 11009.64s]  It just was expensive to come in the front door.
[11009.64s -> 11011.56s]  As you see, pretty beautiful plan here.
[11011.56s -> 11014.84s]  We've got the the mustard walls got a little bit.
[11014.84s -> 11016.36s]  This is smart TV, by the way.
[11016.36s -> 11018.44s]  I don't think Ludwig had a smart TV in his house.
[11018.44s -> 11020.92s]  I had a curved monitor, which I mean, that's kind of a meme, isn't it?
[11021.90s -> 11023.98s]  Yeah, I don't really get the application of those.
[11023.98s -> 11025.10s]  Yeah, weird.
[11025.10s -> 11027.90s]  Like mine really impartial, not really impartial.
[11027.90s -> 11029.98s]  So I just he's right.
[11029.98s -> 11032.31s]  I mean, the kitchen, it's a small kitchen.
[11032.31s -> 11035.35s]  But, you know, the big coup de grace here is this is a sauna.
[11035.35s -> 11037.21s]  Smart TVs cause cancer.
[11037.21s -> 11038.33s]  So this is a nice sauna.
[11038.33s -> 11040.17s]  You can get in here, sit down, relax.
[11040.17s -> 11041.85s]  Turn out if you've ever been to a sauna.
[11042.97s -> 11045.61s]  He thought about that, though, because saunas prevent cancer.
[11045.61s -> 11048.73s]  So if you go to the smart TV, you can walk in the sauna and then you're fine.
[11048.73s -> 11052.01s]  And then you can sweat out all the talking and everything.
[11052.01s -> 11052.49s]  Beach.
[11052.49s -> 11053.05s]  Yep.
[11053.05s -> 11053.45s]  In beach.
[11053.45s -> 11053.93s]  You don't need it.
[11053.93s -> 11054.57s]  It's really nice.
[11054.57s -> 11057.18s]  This door go outside.
[11057.18s -> 11061.26s]  That is don't forget about the fact that this is like an apartment door.
[11061.26s -> 11062.54s]  I think it's cool.
[11062.54s -> 11064.30s]  Number 12 bathrooms in there.
[11064.30s -> 11064.62s]  Yeah.
[11064.62s -> 11065.82s]  Who the fuck cares about the bathroom?
[11065.82s -> 11066.46s]  Bathrooms are dumb.
[11066.46s -> 11067.98s]  Anyways, this is just a little.
[11067.98s -> 11070.14s]  Let's take a look inside the bathroom.
[11070.14s -> 11071.90s]  You can hang your coat over there if you wanted.
[11073.02s -> 11074.14s]  Is that the toilet?
[11074.14s -> 11075.82s]  What's that blue paint splodger?
[11075.82s -> 11077.58s]  It's where that's not.
[11077.58s -> 11078.38s]  It was just somebody.
[11078.38s -> 11079.58s]  It's it's an accident.
[11081.64s -> 11082.20s]  Here's the sink.
[11082.20s -> 11082.92s]  That's great.
[11082.92s -> 11084.04s]  Yeah, toilet paper.
[11084.04s -> 11085.00s]  This is a state of the art.
[11085.88s -> 11087.40s]  It's one of those nice toilets.
[11087.40s -> 11091.64s]  It is like the wall shower for me and walk in the shower.
[11091.64s -> 11092.04s]  Sure.
[11092.04s -> 11096.65s]  Yeah, just like some exposed plumbing in some spots.
[11102.52s -> 11103.40s]  It's hard to get out of.
[11103.40s -> 11106.28s]  But then this, by the way, this door is fucking tiny.
[11106.28s -> 11108.04s]  It's like a his and hers shower.
[11108.04s -> 11111.72s]  Yeah, it's a it's any wherever.
[11111.72s -> 11113.10s]  OK, here we go.
[11113.10s -> 11116.22s]  Down here into the this is just a bedroom area.
[11116.22s -> 11116.78s]  I got you.
[11116.78s -> 11117.82s]  This is also smart TV.
[11118.87s -> 11120.39s]  And you get the big big.
[11120.39s -> 11120.87s]  Be careful.
[11122.10s -> 11122.82s]  Master bedroom.
[11124.44s -> 11126.04s]  Really, it's up to you what you want to put in here.
[11126.04s -> 11126.84s]  You want to have this house.
[11127.96s -> 11129.96s]  You could because there's nothing in there right now.
[11129.96s -> 11130.28s]  Yeah.
[11130.28s -> 11133.82s]  I mean, you could put it could be like a den down here.
[11133.82s -> 11136.62s]  They could be a play area.
[11136.62s -> 11137.10s]  Yeah.
[11137.10s -> 11139.90s]  Yeah, I feel like it's a fixer upper down there.
[11139.90s -> 11142.14s]  But I feel like it reminds me of the movie Room.
[11142.14s -> 11143.66s]  Yeah, that's what it reminds me of.
[11143.66s -> 11144.46s]  Like Brie Larson.
[11145.02s -> 11148.46s]  But I really feel like it's the sauna connected to the kitchen.
[11148.46s -> 11152.87s]  I think the design, especially the exterior, the blue,
[11152.87s -> 11155.51s]  I think speaks a lot to one of my favorite series.
[11155.51s -> 11156.31s]  I might be yours, too.
[11156.31s -> 11157.59s]  It's not the hedgehog.
[11157.67s -> 11158.79s]  Oh, I love Sonic.
[11158.79s -> 11159.75s]  Yeah, one of my favorites.
[11159.75s -> 11159.91s]  All right.
[11159.91s -> 11161.27s]  Time's up, time's up, time's up, time's up.
[11161.27s -> 11162.39s]  Brown housing over, brown housing over.
[11162.39s -> 11163.35s]  Tails is cool, too, isn't it?
[11163.35s -> 11164.86s]  Because this color is tails.
[11164.86s -> 11167.46s]  It's like he's right.
[11167.46s -> 11169.38s]  I had pink, which was like.
[11169.38s -> 11171.38s]  You were you said it was like Dragon Ball.
[11171.38s -> 11175.70s]  It was like it was like Sonic's balls, which are.
[11175.70s -> 11176.50s]  They're not pink.
[11176.50s -> 11177.14s]  They're not pink.
[11177.14s -> 11177.94s]  And I was even right.
[11177.94s -> 11178.90s]  It's not even correct.
[11178.90s -> 11181.37s]  A new picture of them.
[11181.37s -> 11182.17s]  There's a lot of picture.
[11182.17s -> 11183.93s]  I'm sure you can find many different colors.
[11184.57s -> 11190.41s]  Amy, why is pretty spamming Smite Sunday to me right now?
[11190.41s -> 11196.39s]  So, Connor, with all that information, where's your head at?
[11196.39s -> 11197.75s]  What are you thinking?
[11197.75s -> 11198.95s]  Talk to us.
[11198.95s -> 11200.95s]  Do I need to give like a number score for each
[11200.95s -> 11202.71s]  or just say like which one is better?
[11202.71s -> 11204.15s]  You could you could you could.
[11204.15s -> 11207.75s]  Yeah, give a number score starting starting with starting with me.
[11207.75s -> 11208.31s]  If you could.
[11210.65s -> 11217.14s]  What I like about yours, Ludwig was, you know, the it had heart, you know,
[11217.14s -> 11220.02s]  like you obviously had like a vision when you went into it.
[11220.18s -> 11229.75s]  But I like how like a third of the space was a bathroom or two bathrooms is and hers.
[11229.75s -> 11230.79s]  You know, exactly.
[11230.79s -> 11232.63s]  Well, so kind of on his story.
[11233.27s -> 11237.51s]  But Jerma has a his and her shower, which I thought was kind of a neat addition
[11237.51s -> 11238.63s]  where you can say that.
[11238.63s -> 11239.11s]  Not him.
[11239.11s -> 11240.71s]  I just want to cut inside and cut you off.
[11241.35s -> 11242.95s]  No, I never said those words.
[11242.95s -> 11244.15s]  Let's be very, very clear.
[11244.15s -> 11245.11s]  This is a shower.
[11246.06s -> 11247.90s]  You can enter from two different spots.
[11247.90s -> 11249.34s]  You can enter from two different spots.
[11249.50s -> 11251.02s]  That doesn't make his interest.
[11251.02s -> 11252.30s]  It just makes it a hazard.
[11253.42s -> 11254.86s]  I want to be clear about that.
[11254.86s -> 11259.26s]  That that glass door opening into a wall is a threat to liability.
[11260.54s -> 11261.02s]  All right.
[11261.02s -> 11263.26s]  But but yeah, I see where you had that.
[11263.26s -> 11267.74s]  Yeah, I like I liked your basement Ludwig because I, you know, I'm a streamer
[11267.74s -> 11270.70s]  and I like how it kind of thought of that, you know,
[11270.70s -> 11273.66s]  is like if I'm going to live in one of these, I'd probably need that that space.
[11274.70s -> 11277.66s]  Yeah, as a streamer, I always feel like I want to ready to go.
[11277.66s -> 11281.34s]  Don't you want to do don't you want to decorate your own space?
[11281.34s -> 11283.74s]  Yeah, and see, and that's that's what I like about Jerma's.
[11283.74s -> 11286.94s]  That was Jerma not only to have a bedroom downstairs with a smart TV,
[11286.94s -> 11288.22s]  but he also thought of like, you know,
[11288.22s -> 11290.78s]  preventive measures with the smart TV, with the sauna.
[11290.78s -> 11292.78s]  And you can say like, you know, the sauna is unnecessary
[11292.78s -> 11294.94s]  because it's like they're on the beach.
[11294.94s -> 11299.80s]  But it's at the same time that sometimes you don't want to be in the sun
[11299.80s -> 11301.82s]  and you want to like feel the heat.
[11301.82s -> 11304.92s]  You want to be I don't want to go outside all the time.
[11304.92s -> 11305.32s]  Right.
[11305.32s -> 11307.80s]  But it's like I'm in the sun.
[11308.20s -> 11309.40s]  I don't want to go outside.
[11309.40s -> 11312.20s]  Sauna kind of doesn't make any sense in like a summer beach house, does it?
[11313.40s -> 11313.96s]  Not really.
[11314.84s -> 11315.24s]  Not really.
[11315.24s -> 11317.80s]  But you know, it's kind of like a status symbol, though.
[11317.80s -> 11321.08s]  It's like, yeah, I'm rich enough to have a sauna while I live on the beach.
[11321.72s -> 11323.00s]  Connected to your kitchen, by the way.
[11323.96s -> 11325.00s]  It is connected to the kitchen.
[11325.00s -> 11326.54s]  It's very accessible.
[11326.54s -> 11330.54s]  Although kind of I'm not going to tell you anything bad about my house.
[11330.54s -> 11331.10s]  It's a great house.
[11332.06s -> 11334.94s]  So Connor, what would you give my score, final score,
[11335.58s -> 11338.46s]  keeping the stream room in consideration, also the protection?
[11338.46s -> 11340.30s]  It's hard for you to like give a number score.
[11340.30s -> 11342.54s]  But this guy just spoke for the first time I chat.
[11342.54s -> 11345.10s]  His name is Minecraft's quickscoper 2007.
[11345.10s -> 11347.66s]  And I'm going to have him pick because it's his first.
[11347.66s -> 11349.74s]  I'm going to have him give you a number.
[11349.74s -> 11350.78s]  Minecraft quickscoper.
[11350.78s -> 11351.90s]  What do you think, man?
[11351.90s -> 11354.60s]  Is he going to do Jerma's too or?
[11354.60s -> 11354.84s]  Yeah.
[11354.84s -> 11356.68s]  I mean, maybe whatever he wants.
[11357.48s -> 11358.20s]  That's OK.
[11358.20s -> 11359.40s]  He gave you a five little.
[11359.40s -> 11362.42s]  You got a five out of five or out of 10.
[11362.42s -> 11363.22s]  Did he clarify?
[11363.22s -> 11363.62s]  I don't know.
[11364.66s -> 11365.62s]  He just said five.
[11367.45s -> 11367.85s]  OK.
[11368.57s -> 11369.69s]  He said Jerma's an eight.
[11373.72s -> 11375.40s]  What about you, Connor?
[11375.40s -> 11377.64s]  How much watch time does he have on both of our channels?
[11380.62s -> 11381.66s]  His account was made today.
[11382.62s -> 11386.12s]  This could be like a band account for me.
[11386.12s -> 11388.04s]  That's, you know, making their way over to you.
[11388.04s -> 11390.76s]  I think I think that's a pretty accurate score, though.
[11390.76s -> 11392.60s]  It's a band account on your channel.
[11394.28s -> 11395.56s]  Could be, you know.
[11395.56s -> 11396.68s]  So so all right.
[11396.68s -> 11398.44s]  So you give me a five.
[11398.44s -> 11399.40s]  Jerma gets a point.
[11399.72s -> 11402.84s]  I will say I will say eight is a little generous for Jerma
[11402.84s -> 11407.78s]  only because you did point out the fact that the shower does go into the wall,
[11407.78s -> 11410.50s]  which kind of goes against the whole his and hers idea of the bathroom,
[11410.50s -> 11411.86s]  because then it's like tough to enter.
[11413.06s -> 11417.38s]  So I will say Jerma was a bit more of like a seven instead of instead of an eight.
[11419.14s -> 11420.34s]  The glass shattering.
[11420.34s -> 11420.66s]  Great.
[11420.66s -> 11423.86s]  But I also like Jerma's better because I don't like Dragon Ball.
[11423.86s -> 11424.66s]  I don't watch anime.
[11424.66s -> 11426.02s]  Only anime watches Pokemon.
[11426.02s -> 11428.90s]  Such a deep, deep, deep insight.
[11428.98s -> 11432.42s]  I told I told everybody in my chat that's why you clean up the Dragon Balls.
[11432.42s -> 11435.30s]  You don't know what series they don't know exactly.
[11435.30s -> 11435.78s]  Exactly.
[11435.78s -> 11438.50s]  And Ludwig knows that too, which is why I was a little surprised by that.
[11438.50s -> 11442.58s]  Like, I can't wait to collect them all and pray for you to leave this.
[11442.58s -> 11446.50s]  I would rather collect all the Pokemon is what I would do rather than Dragon Balls.
[11446.50s -> 11450.50s]  He literally just has a big old bag of Dragon Balls that he just brought outside of his house.
[11450.50s -> 11451.54s]  He only has three of them, though.
[11451.54s -> 11453.59s]  You had like a lot of them.
[11453.59s -> 11454.79s]  Oh, it's a fucking cat toy.
[11454.79s -> 11455.67s]  What are you talking about?
[11455.67s -> 11456.87s]  He also just brought it back.
[11456.87s -> 11459.06s]  Oh, I have a cat.
[11459.30s -> 11463.70s]  You know, it's like you put like a little spins around like the mice kind of move around.
[11463.70s -> 11464.18s]  OK, yeah.
[11464.18s -> 11466.02s]  Jerma got seven point five.
[11466.02s -> 11466.50s]  All right, Connor.
[11466.50s -> 11467.38s]  It feels like you made your mind up.
[11467.38s -> 11468.34s]  It feels like you made your mind up.
[11468.34s -> 11469.14s]  It feels like Jerma won that.
[11469.14s -> 11470.02s]  Thank you so much, Connor.
[11470.02s -> 11471.14s]  Really, really great insight there.
[11471.14s -> 11471.38s]  Really.
[11471.38s -> 11472.66s]  No problem, guys.
[11472.66s -> 11473.14s]  No problem.
[11473.14s -> 11473.86s]  No problem.
[11473.86s -> 11474.90s]  What are you up to later today?
[11475.78s -> 11477.62s]  Oh, you booted him.
[11477.62s -> 11478.42s]  Oh, that was me.
[11478.42s -> 11479.14s]  Shit.
[11479.14s -> 11480.66s]  Absolute piece of shit.
[11480.66s -> 11483.70s]  But his and hers, his and hers from the get go.
[11483.70s -> 11485.30s]  He was on your side, Jerma.
[11485.30s -> 11488.10s]  Well, to be fair, we've got to be we've got to be fair.
[11488.10s -> 11489.78s]  We can critique each other's work at this point.
[11490.10s -> 11493.10s]  I mean, I mean, half your house is bathroom.
[11493.10s -> 11495.34s]  I think that I couldn't have a better basement.
[11495.34s -> 11496.70s]  I could not have a better basement.
[11496.70s -> 11499.91s]  I mean, and there are weapons pointing in every direction of people.
[11499.91s -> 11501.35s]  Why are you saying it like it's a bad thing?
[11501.99s -> 11505.91s]  I just don't think I would want to have like a weapon like a turret in the house.
[11505.91s -> 11507.03s]  OK, I disagree.
[11507.03s -> 11507.83s]  I disagree in this.
[11507.83s -> 11511.27s]  And I'm I bought it because I was scared the liberals would take it away.
[11511.27s -> 11515.50s]  So I just talked up early and often.
[11515.50s -> 11520.68s]  OK, but, you know, with to each their own, I guess your OK,
[11520.76s -> 11523.96s]  your bedroom was I thought I lost on your bedroom alone.
[11523.96s -> 11525.42s]  I just should have started.
[11525.42s -> 11528.01s]  Streamer bedroom was like, oh, no.
[11528.01s -> 11528.81s]  And it was like beautiful.
[11528.81s -> 11530.65s]  You had the big accent wall with the lights.
[11530.65s -> 11531.53s]  I was like, this is bad.
[11531.53s -> 11536.09s]  I'm like, well, the lights I had a beautiful, beautiful Persian rug.
[11536.65s -> 11538.81s]  I was, you know, admittedly my upstairs.
[11538.81s -> 11542.28s]  Can you I I do like how you terraformed your house.
[11542.28s -> 11544.60s]  Yeah, I exterior was important to me.
[11545.56s -> 11548.84s]  Interior, too, because you added the whole wall right across.
[11548.84s -> 11549.88s]  You made it two rooms.
[11550.44s -> 11553.16s]  And the sauna, you know, that was that was the sauna.
[11553.16s -> 11555.82s]  You probably spent a little too much time on that.
[11555.82s -> 11558.84s]  I was. Yeah.
[11558.84s -> 11561.24s]  Well, German, that does make it three, three now.
[11561.24s -> 11567.51s]  OK, three to three, which makes it my turn.
[11567.51s -> 11570.63s]  It does, which means I get to pick the game.
[11570.63s -> 11572.23s]  What games do I even have left?
[11572.23s -> 11574.42s]  So where are we going?
[11574.42s -> 11579.29s]  What games do I even have left?
[11579.29s -> 11581.53s]  You just take a little squeak over here.
[11581.53s -> 11587.62s]  Look. Oh, of course.
[11587.62s -> 11588.42s]  I don't like that.
[11588.42s -> 11590.58s]  I don't like that realization that you found something good.
[11593.51s -> 11596.87s]  Yeah, I'm just going to send you a link, a link.
[11596.87s -> 11598.63s]  I don't even get to know what it is.
[11598.63s -> 11599.43s]  No, you'll see.
[11599.43s -> 11599.75s]  You'll see.
[11599.75s -> 11600.07s]  You'll see.
[11600.07s -> 11603.27s]  Just just you'll see the link and you'll get to play.
[11603.27s -> 11604.95s]  Don't leak the link if you could.
[11604.95s -> 11616.30s]  I will not leak the link.
[11616.30s -> 11618.74s]  OK. What's wrong?
[11620.58s -> 11624.49s]  How much experience do you have with this with with with this game?
[11624.49s -> 11629.13s]  With this game in particular, a mild amount of experience.
[11629.13s -> 11637.29s]  Occasionally, I have booted up a game once a year.
[11637.29s -> 11640.90s]  OK, do I? How do I like make a click on a seat?
[11640.90s -> 11646.07s]  Click on a seat and then just type your name in.
[11646.07s -> 11647.51s]  What about intended stack?
[11648.81s -> 11650.33s]  That's just put a thousand.
[11650.33s -> 11654.09s]  OK, he's making me play poker.
[11654.09s -> 11656.25s]  It's heads up poker.
[11656.25s -> 11657.29s]  That's right.
[11657.29s -> 11658.33s]  That is right.
[11658.33s -> 11660.50s]  You need the owner to approve of this.
[11660.50s -> 11662.15s]  Approved.
[11662.15s -> 11662.87s]  OK, approved.
[11663.83s -> 11665.11s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11665.11s -> 11666.71s]  I don't I don't there's no timer.
[11666.71s -> 11667.43s]  There's no timer.
[11667.43s -> 11668.63s]  I don't know.
[11668.63s -> 11670.17s]  OK, there's no timer.
[11670.17s -> 11670.73s]  All right.
[11670.73s -> 11671.69s]  There's no time.
[11671.69s -> 11672.49s]  You can take your sweet.
[11672.49s -> 11674.01s]  Oh, there's a timer at the bottom of this.
[11674.89s -> 11676.01s]  So yeah, but there's a timer.
[11676.01s -> 11677.85s]  But Texas hold them.
[11677.85s -> 11678.73s]  Texas hold them.
[11678.73s -> 11679.90s]  That's right.
[11679.90s -> 11682.70s]  Oh, because there is a timer and you got a little good time.
[11682.70s -> 11685.26s]  When I said there's no timer, I meant that more like metaphorically.
[11685.26s -> 11685.74s]  OK.
[11685.74s -> 11686.06s]  All right.
[11686.06s -> 11688.30s]  So I can see your hand, though.
[11688.30s -> 11689.34s]  I just showed it to you.
[11689.34s -> 11689.82s]  What?
[11689.82s -> 11692.66s]  So like, for example, I can raise right here.
[11692.66s -> 11693.78s]  I'll just I'll do a slight raise.
[11693.78s -> 11694.98s]  We have a thousand chips total.
[11694.98s -> 11696.90s]  Whoever has all the chips at the end wins.
[11696.90s -> 11697.62s]  And that can happen.
[11697.62s -> 11698.58s]  The river comes out.
[11698.58s -> 11699.86s]  Is it Texas hold them?
[11699.86s -> 11700.82s]  Yeah, it's Texas hold them.
[11700.82s -> 11702.50s]  So the flop will come out.
[11702.50s -> 11703.46s]  But you have to call.
[11703.46s -> 11706.76s]  There is the flop, you know, and then it's action to you.
[11707.40s -> 11708.28s]  And then you can check.
[11708.28s -> 11709.08s]  You can raise.
[11709.08s -> 11710.94s]  Let's go ahead and bet.
[11710.94s -> 11712.06s]  Hey, I don't call it.
[11712.06s -> 11712.62s]  I'll call it.
[11712.62s -> 11713.82s]  And then you call it.
[11713.82s -> 11714.54s]  There's an ace.
[11714.54s -> 11715.34s]  Action to you again.
[11715.34s -> 11718.30s]  You know, and what you just keep betting, right?
[11718.30s -> 11719.58s]  Yeah, you just keep betting.
[11719.58s -> 11721.77s]  And whoever gets all that.
[11721.77s -> 11723.45s]  And then like you bet like a little bit there.
[11723.45s -> 11725.93s]  And then maybe I'd be like I'd be like, you know, what?
[11725.93s -> 11727.29s]  What's what's 50?
[11727.29s -> 11728.41s]  What's 50 more?
[11728.41s -> 11729.05s]  You know what I mean?
[11729.05s -> 11729.61s]  Just small.
[11729.61s -> 11730.81s]  It's a nominal amount.
[11730.81s -> 11731.93s]  It's a nominal amount.
[11731.93s -> 11736.95s]  What does that mean?
[11736.95s -> 11740.97s]  Jerma, you absolute idiot.
[11740.97s -> 11741.93s]  Am I stupid?
[11741.93s -> 11749.26s]  Because I just won the game.
[11749.26s -> 11751.67s]  That's a three of a kind.
[11751.67s -> 11755.72s]  You just got shocked.
[11755.72s -> 11758.36s]  I just shocked him.
[11758.36s -> 11759.72s]  I play poker all the time.
[11759.72s -> 11761.59s]  Some of my favorite games.
[11761.59s -> 11764.15s]  I play poker every day of my life.
[11764.15s -> 11765.27s]  I play it more than Blackjack.
[11765.27s -> 11766.63s]  I play it more than Elden Ring.
[11766.63s -> 11770.01s]  I just shocked him.
[11770.01s -> 11772.30s]  You flopped a set.
[11772.30s -> 11773.66s]  You flopped a set.
[11775.16s -> 11776.84s]  I thought he was being stupid.
[11776.84s -> 11779.48s]  I thought he was being I don't know what I'm doing.
[11779.48s -> 11780.92s]  I thought he was actually stupid.
[11780.92s -> 11782.07s]  I'm still in it.
[11782.07s -> 11782.79s]  I'm still in it.
[11782.79s -> 11783.35s]  I'm still in it.
[11783.35s -> 11784.55s]  What are we playing to?
[11784.55s -> 11785.91s]  I'm still it's whoever gets the most chips.
[11785.91s -> 11787.19s]  You have to get all my chips.
[11787.19s -> 11790.20s]  It's whoever gets all the chips.
[11790.20s -> 11792.84s]  I still I had 50 because I won the first hand.
[11792.84s -> 11794.36s]  I had 575.
[11795.56s -> 11796.92s]  I'm taking them all.
[11796.92s -> 11798.68s]  I chip in a chair.
[11800.04s -> 11800.68s]  Let's go.
[11800.68s -> 11801.96s]  King. King.
[11801.96s -> 11803.48s]  We're going to see another nine and I'm going to win.
[11803.48s -> 11803.98s]  King me.
[11804.76s -> 11805.40s]  Yes.
[11805.72s -> 11806.04s]  It's all right.
[11806.04s -> 11807.40s]  We're going to see a nine and I'm going to win.
[11807.40s -> 11809.14s]  Give me a nine.
[11809.14s -> 11812.52s]  Give me a nine.
[11812.52s -> 11814.84s]  Oh, that's all right.
[11814.84s -> 11815.24s]  It's all right.
[11815.24s -> 11818.28s]  I took all of your money before.
[11818.28s -> 11818.84s]  No, no, no.
[11818.84s -> 11819.48s]  This is the comeback.
[11819.48s -> 11823.61s]  This is the comeback.
[11823.61s -> 11825.45s]  Oh, this is a fucking amazing hand.
[11825.45s -> 11826.57s]  This is an amazing go all in.
[11826.57s -> 11826.97s]  Go all in.
[11826.97s -> 11827.45s]  Go all in.
[11827.45s -> 11828.41s]  You're going to come into 150.
[11828.41s -> 11828.97s]  Don't be shy.
[11828.97s -> 11831.37s]  I'm just why would I do something like that?
[11831.37s -> 11832.01s]  Come on.
[11832.01s -> 11832.49s]  Come on.
[11833.37s -> 11833.69s]  Let's see.
[11833.69s -> 11835.05s]  How about we just go all in?
[11835.05s -> 11837.02s]  You're going all in with 150 chips.
[11838.06s -> 11839.74s]  You're sitting next to a billionaire right now.
[11840.62s -> 11841.80s]  I call.
[11841.80s -> 11842.60s]  It doesn't matter to me.
[11843.00s -> 11845.82s]  I'm just trying to bluff them.
[11845.82s -> 11847.74s]  I'm taking all these chips right now.
[11847.74s -> 11848.14s]  No, no, no.
[11848.14s -> 11848.46s]  I can win.
[11848.46s -> 11848.86s]  I can win.
[11848.86s -> 11849.42s]  Nine.
[11849.42s -> 11849.74s]  Nine.
[11849.74s -> 11850.38s]  No, you cannot.
[11850.38s -> 11851.67s]  It's a nine.
[11851.67s -> 11852.17s]  Nine.
[11853.90s -> 11854.40s]  Nine.
[11856.06s -> 11859.13s]  Oh, my God.
[11859.13s -> 11861.45s]  I just I honestly that is fucking crazy.
[11862.33s -> 11864.25s]  I can't believe I all into you.
[11864.25s -> 11865.45s]  And I just.
[11865.45s -> 11878.09s]  Jerma.
[11878.09s -> 11879.53s]  Yo, what's up?
[11879.53s -> 11881.75s]  It's time to play some Connect Four.
[11881.75s -> 11882.79s]  You were playing Connect Four?
[11884.30s -> 11888.66s]  Best of five.
[11888.66s -> 11891.22s]  Oh, that was that was very humorous.
[11891.22s -> 11894.07s]  I will say.
[11894.07s -> 11894.71s]  Queen eight.
[11894.71s -> 11895.75s]  Queen fucking eight.
[11895.75s -> 11900.22s]  He goes all in after I raise it with ace king.
[11900.22s -> 11903.96s]  And he bets 50.
[11903.96s -> 11904.76s]  Like it's 50.
[11904.76s -> 11908.76s]  Like I told I had I knew what was happening there.
[11909.56s -> 11912.46s]  Hey, you you had a choice.
[11912.46s -> 11913.85s]  Oh, yeah.
[11913.85s -> 11915.05s]  What were the choices?
[11915.05s -> 11917.82s]  You could have folded.
[11917.82s -> 11920.58s]  You son of a bitch.
[11920.58s -> 11922.66s]  You son of a bitch.
[11922.66s -> 11924.18s]  So what's the what's the score right now?
[11924.18s -> 11925.14s]  Four to three.
[11925.14s -> 11925.78s]  Four to three.
[11925.78s -> 11927.06s]  It's game point for you.
[11927.06s -> 11929.86s]  So how many games we have left?
[11929.86s -> 11931.14s]  Well, if you win this, it's over.
[11931.70s -> 11934.30s]  The only games left are the neutral games.
[11934.30s -> 11934.70s]  Oh, shit.
[11934.70s -> 11936.94s]  What are the neutral games that we have if this keeps going?
[11936.94s -> 11938.54s]  Connect or rock, paper, scissors.
[11938.54s -> 11941.10s]  And you get to pick between rock, paper, scissors and react time.
[11941.10s -> 11941.74s]  If I win this.
[11941.74s -> 11944.54s]  Oh, dude, this is this might come down to rock, paper, scissors.
[11944.54s -> 11946.30s]  What a fucking disaster.
[11946.30s -> 11947.26s]  OK, all right.
[11947.26s -> 11947.82s]  Here you go.
[11947.82s -> 11948.62s]  Here you go, Jerma.
[11948.62s -> 11948.94s]  Let's see.
[11948.94s -> 11950.65s]  Here's your link.
[11950.65s -> 11952.22s]  Put in your name.
[11952.22s -> 11954.14s]  Connect for best of five.
[11954.14s -> 11957.99s]  It's the best of five.
[11957.99s -> 11959.43s]  I'm assuming I don't want to show this.
[11959.43s -> 11960.63s]  Not playing two in town chat.
[11960.63s -> 11961.83s]  I'm not playing two in town.
[11961.83s -> 11962.55s]  I'm assuming I don't.
[11963.27s -> 11964.55s]  I do not want to show this, right?
[11964.55s -> 11965.35s]  I would not show this.
[11965.35s -> 11968.06s]  I would keep this private so I can show this.
[11969.19s -> 11969.43s]  Yeah.
[11969.99s -> 11970.71s]  Timers on the screen.
[11970.71s -> 11971.27s]  It's your move.
[11972.98s -> 11989.46s]  I haven't played connect for and since I was probably four.
[12008.52s -> 12011.03s]  That's got to be a joke.
[12012.47s -> 12013.03s]  It wasn't.
[12014.25s -> 12014.89s]  It wasn't.
[12014.89s -> 12015.37s]  What is this?
[12016.01s -> 12033.90s]  What are these moves?
[12033.90s -> 12034.54s]  Guys, I don't know.
[12034.54s -> 12035.58s]  I don't play connect for.
[12035.58s -> 12036.14s]  I don't.
[12036.14s -> 12037.26s]  I know you just get four in a row.
[12037.26s -> 12037.58s]  I don't know.
[12039.24s -> 12039.72s]  I panicked.
[12039.72s -> 12040.20s]  I panicked.
[12045.37s -> 12045.85s]  Whatever.
[12045.85s -> 12046.17s]  Fuck.
[12046.17s -> 12046.81s]  Who cares?
[12047.77s -> 12048.58s]  All right.
[12048.58s -> 12048.74s]  Fuck.
[12048.74s -> 12049.14s]  Who cares?
[12049.14s -> 12049.46s]  There's one.
[12049.46s -> 12050.10s]  This is the best of five.
[12050.10s -> 12050.58s]  That's the best of five.
[12050.58s -> 12051.46s]  That's a lot of game love.
[12051.46s -> 12052.02s]  It's a lot.
[12052.02s -> 12052.90s]  I just rematch.
[12052.90s -> 12053.37s]  Yeah.
[12053.37s -> 12053.77s]  Rematch.
[12053.77s -> 12054.49s]  Rematch.
[12054.49s -> 12056.58s]  He starts again.
[12056.58s -> 12056.82s]  Of course.
[12056.82s -> 12068.73s]  He starts again.
[12068.73s -> 12069.29s]  Hmm.
[12069.29s -> 12070.09s]  A mirror match.
[12070.89s -> 12163.35s]  Time's up.
[12163.35s -> 12178.22s]  Fuck.
[12178.22s -> 12178.62s]  I don't know.
[12179.26s -> 12180.65s]  I don't know.
[12180.65s -> 12181.13s]  I don't know.
[12181.13s -> 12181.85s]  I actually don't know.
[12181.85s -> 12182.25s]  I'm scared.
[12182.25s -> 12182.97s]  Got to make a call.
[12182.97s -> 12184.01s]  Got to make a play.
[12184.01s -> 12206.66s]  All right, Jerma.
[12206.66s -> 12208.90s]  Yeah.
[12208.90s -> 12214.94s]  One game away from this being a game nine situation.
[12214.94s -> 12215.50s]  Oh, fuck.
[12215.50s -> 12218.30s]  I'm not good at this.
[12218.30s -> 12219.34s]  I'm not good at this.
[12219.42s -> 12221.10s]  Got to make a major comeback.
[12221.10s -> 12222.06s]  Yeah, I'm not good at this.
[12222.06s -> 12223.58s]  I'm not very good at this thing.
[12224.86s -> 12225.66s]  This game.
[12225.66s -> 12239.82s]  I'm starting first here.
[12239.82s -> 12241.66s]  You have no connect force because I know.
[12241.66s -> 12242.70s]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[12242.70s -> 12244.94s]  I just know that there's two colors on the screen and I have to.
[12246.78s -> 12247.74s]  I don't know how this works.
[12247.74s -> 12266.17s]  I mean, I do, but throw a wild card in here.
[12266.17s -> 12269.13s]  Oh, you're trying to do this like diagonal shit.
[12271.24s -> 12272.52s]  I'm just mulling over option.
[12272.52s -> 12273.80s]  I got nothing right now.
[12273.80s -> 12274.52s]  It's quite shut down.
[12317.00s -> 12322.68s]  Fuck.
[12322.68s -> 12323.32s]  I lose.
[12323.32s -> 12328.49s]  It's over.
[12328.49s -> 12333.98s]  Okay.
[12337.22s -> 12341.13s]  Connect four is like tic-tac-toe.
[12341.77s -> 12344.57s]  It's like one way to make sure you win every game.
[12344.57s -> 12345.13s]  And that's it.
[12345.93s -> 12346.57s]  I didn't throw.
[12346.57s -> 12347.29s]  I just don't.
[12347.29s -> 12347.69s]  I didn't.
[12347.69s -> 12348.81s]  I promise I didn't throw.
[12348.81s -> 12349.75s]  All right.
[12349.75s -> 12350.47s]  How are we going to do this?
[12352.74s -> 12354.33s]  Rock, paper, scissors.
[12354.33s -> 12355.77s]  Oh, my God.
[12355.77s -> 12358.50s]  I can't believe this is going to end with rock, paper, scissors.
[12358.50s -> 12364.23s]  We're just going to go full cam for this then, huh?
[12364.23s -> 12364.95s]  We can do full cam.
[12364.95s -> 12368.58s]  There's also a pretty good website for it.
[12368.58s -> 12369.62s]  How do you want to do it?
[12369.62s -> 12370.42s]  I'll link it to you.
[12370.42s -> 12371.62s]  You take a look at that.
[12371.62s -> 12377.87s]  Okay.
[12378.51s -> 12378.67s]  Wait.
[12378.67s -> 12379.79s]  No, I sent you a bad link.
[12379.79s -> 12380.59s]  This link.
[12380.59s -> 12380.91s]  Sorry.
[12381.55s -> 12384.59s]  All right.
[12384.59s -> 12385.71s]  You want to do it through the website?
[12386.43s -> 12389.79s]  I think it's pretty hard if you do it with the delay.
[12389.79s -> 12390.35s]  I've tried it before.
[12390.35s -> 12391.23s]  Yeah, that's true.
[12391.23s -> 12393.37s]  That's absolutely true.
[12393.37s -> 12396.41s]  Exciting as the throw the fist.
[12396.41s -> 12398.33s]  But it's best of five, just so you see.
[12398.33s -> 12401.13s]  Oh, it's best of five.
[12401.13s -> 12401.63s]  Yeah.
[12403.37s -> 12404.01s]  Am I good to show this?
[12404.01s -> 12404.73s]  I have a question for you.
[12405.29s -> 12406.17s]  Yeah, you can show everything.
[12407.80s -> 12411.71s]  Before we jump in, do you happen to watch anime?
[12411.71s -> 12414.41s]  I'm not going to answer any of your questions
[12414.41s -> 12416.09s]  because I feel like if I give you an anime,
[12416.09s -> 12417.61s]  it's going to be tied to one of these items.
[12419.55s -> 12420.83s]  Like if I'm like, why would you?
[12420.83s -> 12422.83s]  That's a weird paper because it's written down.
[12422.83s -> 12425.31s]  It's scissors because they edit it and cut it up.
[12425.31s -> 12429.23s]  It's a rock because you got to have a skull of a rock to do it.
[12429.23s -> 12430.03s]  I come on.
[12430.03s -> 12430.43s]  I don't know.
[12430.43s -> 12432.83s]  I feel like that question, I'm going to say like full metal alchemist
[12432.83s -> 12433.63s]  and you're going to be like scissors
[12433.63s -> 12434.35s]  and you're going to get it.
[12434.35s -> 12435.39s]  So I'm not going to say anything.
[12435.39s -> 12440.00s]  Weird that you would name an anime though.
[12440.00s -> 12440.88s]  I attack on Titan.
[12440.88s -> 12441.60s]  Full metal alchemist.
[12443.82s -> 12444.30s]  There you go.
[12444.30s -> 12445.10s]  There's rock, paper, scissors.
[12445.10s -> 12445.82s]  Now you don't know.
[12445.82s -> 12446.86s]  You have no idea which one I'm going to do.
[12449.05s -> 12449.55s]  Okay.
[12451.70s -> 12454.02s]  Well, I got a question for you then.
[12454.02s -> 12454.90s]  Yeah, please.
[12454.90s -> 12457.89s]  What's your favorite vegetable?
[12457.89s -> 12461.68s]  Carrot.
[12461.68s -> 12463.36s]  Is it really?
[12463.36s -> 12465.73s]  Are you sure it's carrot?
[12465.73s -> 12468.13s]  I like carrot.
[12471.58s -> 12476.75s]  That means, okay, you must be a fan of orange.
[12476.75s -> 12477.25s]  I knew it.
[12478.43s -> 12479.15s]  I knew it.
[12481.55s -> 12482.67s]  Wait, why would I pick that?
[12482.67s -> 12484.11s]  That was your thing.
[12484.11s -> 12485.87s]  Because you like anime.
[12485.87s -> 12487.14s]  I just picked the orange one.
[12487.14s -> 12489.70s]  Everyone who watches anime picks teasers first.
[12489.70s -> 12495.55s]  It was subconscious.
[12495.55s -> 12499.46s]  Ask me a question.
[12499.46s -> 12500.10s]  Okay.
[12500.10s -> 12503.55s]  Would you consider yourself
[12504.85s -> 12507.01s]  solid, like a stone?
[12507.01s -> 12508.69s]  Are you someone that can be relied on?
[12511.89s -> 12514.45s]  Are you constantly, constantly
[12515.25s -> 12517.09s]  cutting things out of your life
[12517.09s -> 12518.85s]  and trying to drop stuff from your life?
[12518.85s -> 12522.74s]  Or are you the type of person that would want to
[12522.74s -> 12526.02s]  get under the covers and get covered?
[12526.98s -> 12531.74s]  I feel like I'll say this honestly.
[12531.74s -> 12533.98s]  I feel like I'm more go with the wind.
[12533.98s -> 12535.09s]  Are you?
[12535.09s -> 12536.21s]  Yeah, I go with the wind.
[12539.30s -> 12540.02s]  Got him.
[12540.02s -> 12541.41s]  How did you know?
[12541.41s -> 12542.69s]  I thought you would think I'm paper.
[12543.33s -> 12545.78s]  Exactly.
[12545.78s -> 12547.78s]  Because rocks go with the wind.
[12547.78s -> 12548.42s]  They do.
[12548.42s -> 12552.48s]  Not as paper.
[12552.48s -> 12552.72s]  All right.
[12552.72s -> 12553.68s]  Let me ask you a question.
[12560.24s -> 12564.58s]  If you already selected, you selected rock.
[12564.58s -> 12566.16s]  You hesitated.
[12566.16s -> 12567.84s]  You hesitated, which meant you're going to pick paper
[12567.84s -> 12568.88s]  because that's the safest choice.
[12568.88s -> 12572.11s]  It's right in the middle.
[12572.11s -> 12573.07s]  I made a decision.
[12573.07s -> 12574.93s]  You did.
[12574.93s -> 12575.25s]  Yes.
[12575.97s -> 12592.83s]  Give me just one moment.
[12614.00s -> 12614.72s]  It's not happening.
[12615.92s -> 12616.72s]  What's not happening?
[12618.24s -> 12619.52s]  I had a whole plan.
[12619.52s -> 12620.64s]  I had a whole plan.
[12620.64s -> 12622.61s]  It failed.
[12622.61s -> 12623.41s]  I had a whole plan.
[12623.41s -> 12623.97s]  It failed.
[12624.45s -> 12625.57s]  What was the plan?
[12626.05s -> 12627.33s]  My music's been buffering all day.
[12627.33s -> 12628.85s]  So I was going to count until it buffered.
[12628.85s -> 12630.53s]  But then the music didn't buffer this time.
[12630.53s -> 12634.21s]  So I've just been counting rock.
[12643.94s -> 12645.46s]  Oh, that was stressful.
[12646.69s -> 12647.73s]  That was stressful.
[12651.15s -> 12652.59s]  It was my tried and true.
[12652.59s -> 12654.35s]  You always go back to your tried and trues.
[12655.47s -> 12656.83s]  It hadn't been picked in a while.
[12656.83s -> 12658.51s]  Rock had not been picked in a while.
[12658.51s -> 12659.23s]  He knew that.
[12659.23s -> 12660.03s]  He fucking knew.
[12660.03s -> 12661.95s]  I thought you were going to go scissors initially.
[12661.95s -> 12662.83s]  That's why I was like, wait.
[12662.83s -> 12665.07s]  But that's why you go in scissors.
[12665.07s -> 12665.63s]  I was like, wait a minute.
[12665.63s -> 12667.55s]  He's going to know that I think he's going scissors.
[12669.18s -> 12669.98s]  You booed me.
[12669.98s -> 12671.50s]  You booed me today, Jerma.
[12671.50s -> 12673.17s]  That's all right.
[12673.17s -> 12675.65s]  I still owe you $1,500 at the roulette table.
[12675.65s -> 12676.85s]  Yeah, I'll still go to Vegas.
[12677.97s -> 12681.12s]  Give you a costume and actually a lot of things.
[12681.12s -> 12682.48s]  Look at a bucket list of things to do.
[12682.48s -> 12683.60s]  Enjoy Toontown.
[12683.60s -> 12684.48s]  I heard it's pretty good.
[12685.12s -> 12686.24s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12686.24s -> 12688.46s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[12688.46s -> 12689.66s]  Oh, that was fun.
[12689.66s -> 12690.72s]  That was a blast.
[12690.72s -> 12691.68s]  That was a good time.
[12691.68s -> 12694.91s]  Thank you very much, Jerma, for gaming.
[12694.91s -> 12695.47s]  Absolutely.
[12695.47s -> 12696.66s]  Anytime, man.
[12696.66s -> 12698.66s]  You know, I've lost almost every single one of these.
[12698.66s -> 12699.46s]  Have you really?
[12700.02s -> 12702.90s]  I almost exclusively lost these.
[12703.94s -> 12706.10s]  It must be cursed.
[12706.10s -> 12708.74s]  I think I'm just a bad gamer is what it turns out to be.
[12709.68s -> 12710.56s]  That was close.
[12710.56s -> 12711.52s]  That was really close.
[12712.80s -> 12718.69s]  If I was 30 seconds factor on Picross, I'm going to play that game on the plane.
[12718.69s -> 12722.05s]  Yeah, the Picross, I think, is what really did you in.
[12723.82s -> 12724.86s]  All right, brother.
[12724.86s -> 12726.13s]  Yeah, thanks a lot.
[12726.13s -> 12727.89s]  Have fun with whatever you're doing next.
[12727.89s -> 12728.61s]  I got a jet.
[12728.61s -> 12729.17s]  I got a jet.
[12729.17s -> 12730.53s]  Are you staying live for a bit?
[12730.53s -> 12731.09s]  I'll be live, yeah.
[12731.09s -> 12733.25s]  I'll be live for like another couple of free parts.
[12733.25s -> 12733.57s]  All right.
[12733.57s -> 12734.21s]  Well, have a good one, brother.
[12734.21s -> 12734.69s]  Have a good stream.
[12734.69s -> 12735.33s]  Yeah, thanks a lot.
[12735.33s -> 12735.89s]  It was fun.
[12735.89s -> 12736.53s]  Peace.
[12736.53s -> 12740.10s]  That was a lot of fun.
[12740.10s -> 12741.06s]  That was awesome.
[12741.06s -> 12741.89s]  I can't.
[12741.89s -> 12743.41s]  I actually won one of these.
[12743.41s -> 12744.93s]  I never win one of these.
[12745.49s -> 12747.23s]  He has a jet.
[12751.63s -> 12752.75s]  I've never won these.
[12752.75s -> 12753.79s]  I don't ever win.
[12754.43s -> 12757.95s]  I thought he was going to get me in the end here.
[12757.95s -> 12759.15s]  Oh, that was fun.
[12759.15s -> 12760.08s]  All right.
[12760.08s -> 12761.04s]  I'm going to take a quick break.
[12761.04s -> 12762.40s]  I'm going to refill my drink.
[12762.40s -> 12764.56s]  Am I going to jump into Elden Ring for a few hours?
[12764.56s -> 12766.96s]  I'll see you guys in.
[12766.96s -> 12768.42s]  Oh, the poker shit.
[12768.42s -> 12768.98s]  Yeah.
[12768.98s -> 12769.70s]  Oh, man.
[12769.70s -> 12773.28s]  That was bad.
[12773.28s -> 12775.44s]  Oh, he got so screwed there.
[12777.62s -> 12779.06s]  I can't believe you did it.
[12779.06s -> 12780.42s]  I can't believe you did that.
[12780.42s -> 12783.65s]  All right.
[12783.65s -> 12784.93s]  I'll be back in like two, three minutes.
[12784.93s -> 12786.85s]  I'm going to go pee and get a drink.
[12786.85s -> 12787.73s]  I'll see you guys in a minute.
