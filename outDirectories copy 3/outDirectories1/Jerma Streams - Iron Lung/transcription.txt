[5.30s -> 12.81s]  Hey, how are you? Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Listen, I don't know what it is about my body.
[13.45s -> 18.81s]  I don't know why my body does this or why it's like this. Well, I mean, I think I could take a guess.
[20.22s -> 28.63s]  At like 358 almost every day, I have to go to the bathroom. It's something the way that like my,
[28.63s -> 37.75s]  my pipes are in my body. It's just like, all right, okay. 355. Let's go. 356. Okay. 357. I gotta go.
[39.16s -> 44.10s]  It happens every day. I, you know what I have to start doing? I have to start just make, I've got
[44.10s -> 53.42s]  to start eating an hour earlier. At least. Yes, I, yeah, hold on. I know. My microphone is changed.
[54.65s -> 62.39s]  I, I'm, well, we're gonna work on it in a minute. My microphone, I fucked with a bunch of settings.
[63.21s -> 67.29s]  So I'm trying to figure out what, how, how, how fucked up it is. I'm, it's, I'm peaking.
[70.09s -> 85.88s]  You sound like the Joker. Sounds fun. How does it sound? It's really loud. Yeah. I mean, I,
[86.60s -> 93.45s]  I've taken the criticism. I turned myself way up and I, I made sure that I was loud as fuck now.
[94.01s -> 105.37s]  You know what I'm saying? He, he went from being way too quiet to really fucking loud.
[106.01s -> 111.19s]  Does it sound all right? We go, should I drop it a little bit? Because I have,
[111.19s -> 117.99s]  let me see what happens if I do this. I sound, I'm louder. Let, let me know if this is a better
[117.99s -> 129.58s]  place. Is this better? Dropping the gain a little bit. How does it sound? Better? Is it fine? You
[129.58s -> 140.50s]  sound like you're canned. I'm canned. Well, you know what I think I want to do one of these days,
[140.50s -> 145.14s]  maybe even today, I don't know, is just do, do a stream where I sit there and just mess with
[145.14s -> 148.82s]  settings until you guys give me all thumbs up emotes. And I have another dead pixel on this
[148.82s -> 164.44s]  monitor and it's really not making me happy. I'll tell you. What do the mods say? Do I, okay,
[164.44s -> 175.59s]  let me ask you this. Do I sound better or worse than I did two days ago? Better or worse than
[175.59s -> 182.58s]  two days ago? Better with question marks. Okay. I need to test this too, because I need to make
[182.58s -> 185.94s]  sure I'm not going to hurt anybody. If I like do like the patent to German on eight, five,
[185.94s -> 190.58s]  yell at the thing on screen. I'm going to yell and I want to see if the compressor catches it.
[190.58s -> 193.14s]  Cause I'm, I need to make sure that happens. Cause I don't want to hurt anybody's ears.
[193.70s -> 197.30s]  So turn me down a little bit and let's, let's test this to see how bad this sounds.
[197.30s -> 204.66s]  Okay. You ready? I'm going to make a loud sound. Just I want to, I'm warning you all right now.
[207.03s -> 220.22s]  What the, what is that? What is that guy? Oh, wow. Oh my God. He just killed me bad. Are we okay?
[220.22s -> 230.34s]  Did it, did it catch it? Did it not? It was all right. That's not all right. Cool. Yeah.
[230.34s -> 234.90s]  Cause when you mess with a compressor like this, or you mess with audio settings, if I yell and
[234.90s -> 239.56s]  the compressor doesn't catch it, it's actually going to be bad and it'll be really way too loud
[239.56s -> 246.02s]  and just fuck up everything. So, all right. All right. All right. Let's go. All right.
[247.00s -> 254.65s]  So his plan is we're doing today. Today, today we're going to be doing iron lung,
[261.10s -> 264.78s]  which people have been saying, you got to do that. You got to play it. I believe this is by the
[264.78s -> 272.73s]  dusk devs or dusk dev. So it's, but it's only an hour long. This is only like maybe an hour to two
[272.73s -> 280.50s]  hours long total. I loved dusk. I thought dusk was one of my, I, you know what, thinking back to dusk,
[282.41s -> 286.65s]  that's, I would put that probably high up on some of my favorite games I played on stream.
[286.65s -> 293.21s]  That game was so much fun. It was great. It was unbelievable. So, I mean, obviously if the person
[293.21s -> 302.49s]  that made dusk or the group that made dusk, I want to play their other game, but it's only going to
[302.49s -> 309.32s]  be like an hour or so. This game is not like dusk. Oh no, I know, I know. I know. I know it's a scary,
[309.32s -> 313.32s]  scary game. I know it's very scary. There's going to be a face cam. Well, okay. Look at the streamer.
[313.32s -> 321.37s]  He got really scared. So we'll do kind of like a scary game thing today. Then after that,
[322.17s -> 329.30s]  we're going to play Glover for the N64. They ported it to Steam and here we go again.
[330.60s -> 337.37s]  Glover was ported to Steam and it was voted on by pre-stream chat. So that's what we're going to do.
[341.98s -> 349.06s]  And then if Glover sucks, and I gotta tell you, Glove buddies, the same rules are going to apply
[349.06s -> 354.90s]  for Glover when I kind of, I mean, maybe, we'll see. If I love the game and I think it's like the
[354.90s -> 359.22s]  most fun I've ever had, I'm going to keep playing it. But after an hour or two in Glover, the
[359.22s -> 364.02s]  strawberry magic rules are going to apply and we're going to have to see how powerful the Glove buddies
[364.02s -> 380.55s]  are. You are sus. Yes. Okay, first thing is first. Wits play Iron Lung, right? Because that's what
[380.55s -> 387.96s]  we're doing. What about eating a glove? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Let me address that.
[388.60s -> 391.94s]  All right. Let me address it. I'll address it. Just give me a second. I gotta tweet this. I'll
[391.94s -> 453.02s]  address it in a second. Be right back. Okay. So a couple of years ago, I made a comment saying,
[455.11s -> 462.15s]  maybe embarrassingly, that the three Stooges were going to be added to Fortnite by April 24th,
[463.03s -> 471.38s]  2022. And I mean, that was probably back in like 2019 or so. And I said I would bet anything.
[472.02s -> 482.84s]  And what I bet was, I bet that I would eat a glove on stream if they weren't in the game by
[482.84s -> 496.36s]  tomorrow. So, so we'll see. We'll see what happens. Well, we'll see. We'll see. You know,
[496.36s -> 501.45s]  we'll see what happens. They could, they could get added tomorrow. It's possible. We'll see.
[509.08s -> 513.16s]  So if they're not added, and look, it's probably like a licensing issue, right? They probably
[513.16s -> 522.97s]  were going to. It's a licensing problem, without a doubt. So I'm sure they tried to add the three
[522.97s -> 527.85s]  Stooges, but paramount pictures or whatever. Probably whoever owns three Stooges were like,
[527.85s -> 531.77s]  nah, we want to live with whatever the whatever the drama behind the scenes was to make it so
[531.77s -> 537.69s]  they weren't in the game. I don't know. But I'm gonna have to eat a glove eventually here.
[538.33s -> 543.56s]  All right. I'm gonna play around with some audio settings. You guys let me know how it sounds.
[544.12s -> 555.16s]  You ready? Let's do a couple of tests. You ready? Here we go. Here's the first test. Hi, guys.
[557.22s -> 565.66s]  This is German. Hold on. Hey, guys. It's me, German985. Coming to you from my studio.
[566.54s -> 572.52s]  And I'm ready to say hi. I'm ready to say what's going on. Ready to check in on how everybody's
[572.52s -> 586.28s]  doing. How are we? Are we good? How are we? Is it better than it just was in his studio?
[588.49s -> 595.64s]  Is that actually better? The mic is too hot. All right. So how about, how about now? How's
[595.64s -> 599.96s]  everybody doing? It's me, German985 here coming at you from my studio. Want to check in on how
[599.96s -> 606.98s]  everybody's doing? Want to see how crispy this sounds? How crunchy it might sound?
[609.75s -> 617.29s]  It's a podcast. Wait, good? You guys can't say good to everything. These are too bassy. All right.
[617.29s -> 625.00s]  Hold on. How about, how does this sound? Hey, guys. It's me, German. Coming at you here from
[626.76s -> 635.54s]  my studio. Just checking to see how crunchy and crunchy this sounds. If we've got some opinions
[635.54s -> 643.99s]  on how I sound, I would love to hear them. They sound the same. Test with a wheeze laugh. Okay.
[648.09s -> 659.58s]  Better? First one was better? Sounds like you're very ugly. Oh, dude, I don't know about this one.
[659.58s -> 669.96s]  You sound really ugly. The first one was, okay, wait. How about now? How about now? Hi, guys.
[670.52s -> 680.50s]  How's everybody doing? We having a good time here? We have, we chilling? This is shit now. Okay. How
[680.50s -> 686.33s]  about this? Hey, guys. How are we doing now? We chilling? Having a good time? Everybody having
[686.33s -> 696.57s]  a relaxing evening? I'm seeing a lot of betters. I'm seeing a lot of betters. Let me see what this
[696.57s -> 700.73s]  sounds like. Hey, how does it sound? Hey, guys. How are you doing? Oh, fuck. This actually sounds
[700.73s -> 707.46s]  like shit. Hold on. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey,
[707.46s -> 715.93s]  guys. Hey, everybody. How's everybody doing? My name is German at eight five. Hi, everybody. How
[715.93s -> 722.23s]  you doing? My name is German. I know this is so fucked up. Look, you can make changes. You can
[722.23s -> 729.21s]  change how you sound. It's so like, look at this. This is ridiculous. Okay. I actually think this
[729.21s -> 734.10s]  one might be the best one. If everyone wants to disagree, they can. I think this actually
[734.10s -> 742.92s]  might be pretty good. Are we in agreement that this one sounds better? To me, this one sounds
[742.92s -> 751.62s]  fine. This one sounds okay. Yeah, I think this is fine for now. I'll figure it out. You're a bad
[751.62s -> 761.21s]  audio quality streamer. He's trolling. No, I'm not. I'm scrolling on shit. I think this actually
[761.21s -> 765.29s]  sounds fine. Can I get a confirmation from the mods and the sounds fucking pog before I go?
[766.01s -> 772.04s]  It's still a little compressed. How about actually this actually sounds better. Oh, yeah. I think I
[772.04s -> 777.38s]  got it. Bingo. Got it right now. This is it. This is the one. This is absolutely the one right here.
[778.74s -> 786.22s]  Yep. It sure is. All right. Let me turn it up. There we go. Guys, I got it. I think I got this
[786.22s -> 790.90s]  the one. This is the one right here. This is the one. This is the one. Nobody move. I got it. This
[790.90s -> 802.87s]  is the one. Yep. I got it. This is good. Let's fucking go. I'm ready. Audio is so fucking hard
[802.87s -> 809.43s]  to work with. It really is like fuck audio. You know what I mean? You know, the worst thing I ever
[809.43s -> 813.51s]  did was I get like a fucking real microphone. I should just have a thing taped to my mouth.
[813.51s -> 824.25s]  The whole, who cares? You guys ready? Let's go. The biggest mistake you can ever make as a streamer
[824.25s -> 827.61s]  is like, Oh, I got to have like a professional microphone and I've got to have a setup where it
[827.61s -> 830.65s]  goes into a compressor and then it goes with the compressor into the computer. And then I go into
[830.65s -> 835.53s]  my audio settings or JG equalizer. No, just give me a tape fucking microphone in my mouth and who
[835.53s -> 843.24s]  cares? And now, now you can hear when I move. I fucked up. God damn it. Do I have the other
[843.24s -> 850.14s]  profile that I had saved? Of course not. Shit. Oh, I fucked it up. I fucked it up so bad.
[854.58s -> 863.56s]  All right. Hold on. Yep. Got it. All right. Let's go. Fucking shitty audio, Andy, whatever.
[864.36s -> 867.32s]  Boy, what do you see? You got to have a professional setup.
[871.29s -> 892.23s]  How are you doing? You're doing good. Let's play iron lung. This is loud. DJ Andy. This is really
[892.23s -> 895.27s]  fucking loud. All right. Is this like, is this getting, is this game going to scream at me?
[895.27s -> 912.54s]  Is this a screamer or am I fine? Lights off. It's, it's like four o'clock in the afternoon guys,
[912.54s -> 970.81s]  but it's not going to do anything. Maybe later. There you go. I just made a mess. No, I didn't.
[970.81s -> 980.41s]  I'm fine. It's just soap. That's all it is. Oh, it's on my hand. All right. So there you go.
[980.41s -> 987.06s]  I ate a glove on stream. What was I doing? I don't even know what I was just doing. What was I just
[987.06s -> 994.86s]  doing? What was I just doing right now? Somebody help me. Turning the lights off. Right. Okay.
[999.93s -> 1010.98s]  They're already off. The lights are already off. They're not on. The lights are already off.
[1010.98s -> 1021.11s]  Are we ready? Okay. I know stalling, stalling, stalling. My microphone sounds like stupid.
[1021.91s -> 1028.95s]  I'm sorry. I thought I was fixing things and I just made it worse. All right. You guys ready?
[1028.95s -> 1053.10s]  Let's go. New game. That was huge. I'm ready. Let's go. Decades ago, every known star and
[1053.10s -> 1058.87s]  habitable planet vanished, leaving only those who were on space stations or starships. This event
[1058.87s -> 1065.14s]  became known as the Quiet Rapture. With supplies dwindling and infrastructure crumbling, survivors
[1065.14s -> 1070.47s]  are searching for any trace of natural resources in a universe of barren moons lit by the ghost
[1070.47s -> 1078.89s]  light of vanished stars. One such moon holds a strange anomaly, an ocean of blood. You are a
[1078.89s -> 1084.17s]  convict tasked with exploring this anomaly in a makeshift submarine nicknamed the Iron Lung.
[1086.44s -> 1092.49s]  It was not designed for this depth, so you will be welded inside and the forward window will be
[1092.49s -> 1100.31s]  closed. There was no time for training. If successful, you earn your freedom. So every
[1100.31s -> 1114.66s]  planet disappeared and got destroyed. Drink the bubble mix. You just coming up with all kinds of
[1114.66s -> 1123.78s]  stupid shit, aren't you? Like for me to do. Why would anybody do that? That's not happening.
[1123.78s -> 1128.89s]  Don't do that. Why would you? Why would anybody do that? Don't be like, take care of your bodies.
[1128.89s -> 1134.04s]  Don't drink fucking like shit that can hurt you. All right. So let me get like a, let me get a
[1134.04s -> 1141.24s]  TLDR here. I was like fucked up voice. Andy's is still reigning supreme here. So I'm a convict.
[1141.96s -> 1169.11s]  Everybody, every all life died and we like got stuck on a space station. You got it. I got a
[1169.11s -> 1206.28s]  better mic than I do. Roger, can you repeat that please? View ASD is move, interact, tabs and map.
[1206.28s -> 1218.20s]  Whoa. Briefing. Two weeks ago, we conducted an exploration of moon 85 for the first time since
[1218.20s -> 1223.75s]  the quiet rapture leading to the discovery of a fourth blood ocean. Trench beneath the ocean
[1223.75s -> 1229.06s]  surface has several points of interest. Your task is to photograph these points of interest
[1229.06s -> 1234.57s]  with the SM 13 forward camera. Photos must be taken within two units of the specified position
[1234.57s -> 1239.75s]  and 10 degrees of the specified angle. You can also use the camera to help with navigation.
[1239.75s -> 1244.50s]  Only photos taken at the specified points of interest will be saved. Since you can't navigate
[1244.50s -> 1249.64s]  by site, pay attention to your coordinates and consult the map. Proximity indicators next to
[1249.64s -> 1259.29s]  the sub controls will trigger if you're getting close to an obstacle. If they laugh, this guy
[1259.29s -> 1278.15s]  wanted to ban geometry in classrooms. Am I going to need some help? All right. So I have to go take
[1278.15s -> 1295.94s]  pictures of this stuff and I have this forward facing camera. What does, what does this do?
[1295.94s -> 1301.67s]  Can I open the, how do I take, can I, can I look at it, look through something? All right. So this
[1301.67s -> 1314.28s]  is, what, what, what, what was it? What was it? Okay. Points of interest. Okay. So X 325,
[1314.28s -> 1328.33s]  Y 741, X 325. Dude, I actually like can't see cause it's too bright in this room. I should've
[1328.33s -> 1332.73s]  played this like in two hours. I'm, I'm playing this game at the absolute worst possible time
[1332.73s -> 1336.81s]  because the sun is like, it's like four o'clock in the afternoon where the sun is like at its
[1336.81s -> 1353.54s]  fucking apex. Okay. That's a, there's so much glare on my screen. What was that? How do I change X?
[1354.95s -> 1385.80s]  All right. What was it? It was, I'll go here first. X 180, Y 576. Can I look out the window?
[1385.80s -> 1404.52s]  I'm in a submarine. Yeah. Do I know where I, okay. Hover over Y five, A 184. Where's A?
[1404.52s -> 1428.86s]  Is this A? Oh no. I'm going south. Okay. How do I change X? I'm in a submarine. Yeah. Yeah. I know.
[1428.86s -> 1439.29s]  But how do I like, oh shit. This is not an expedition. It's, it's an execution. When they
[1439.29s -> 1444.23s]  put you in here, they don't want you to return. And even if you do, and even if they keep their
[1444.23s -> 1451.08s]  promises, what freedom waits for you? A few dying ships in a sea of dead stars. How do I take a
[1451.08s -> 1458.60s]  picture? If there's still hope, it lies beyond the veil. Hoping this void is as illusionary as the
[1458.60s -> 1464.52s]  walls and dark souls and demon souls and dark souls three and Sekiro as the starlight. I will
[1464.52s -> 1469.00s]  choose to breathe my last here at the bottom of the ocean, unseen, unheard and uncontrolled. They
[1469.00s -> 1478.63s]  will get their execution. I will get my freedom. Oh, these are the buttons over here. What's this?
[1478.63s -> 1488.25s]  Ooh, this is the, okay. This is where I am. I just took this picture, right? We've got an,
[1488.25s -> 1507.03s]  we've got an anomaly. How do I move? Oh, okay. I get it. All right. So now what's,
[1507.03s -> 1513.34s]  what's like close to me right here? I need Y, I need something X in like the hundreds, right?
[1513.34s -> 1523.22s]  Am I close to anything? All right. I'm, I'm going to go for, so, okay, help me. We're talking about
[1523.22s -> 1537.21s]  an axis here. So like X, Y, right? Yes. Yeah. So like, um, when I'm talking about the X axis,
[1537.21s -> 1542.90s]  that I'm talking about like left and right, and then Y up and down. They should fucking remove
[1542.90s -> 1548.84s]  geometry from school. Teach people how to do their taxes. Not like what that line and that
[1548.84s -> 1556.17s]  line does. Okay. So I want 180X, which is pretty much there. Let's go a little bit further back
[1556.17s -> 1580.47s]  here. 180. So 180X is here. So I don't know where, where am I in Y? 178. So I'm like right here.
[1580.47s -> 1592.23s]  178. So I'm like down here. Oh, okay. So I'm like right here. So if I go to the right,
[1592.23s -> 1603.21s]  so I need 186 for 22. What am I high? What, what? I don't get it. This is X and Y, right? Isn't this
[1603.21s -> 1613.22s]  like where I am right now? Wait, what are you talking about? The numbers. Yeah, this is X,
[1613.22s -> 1627.29s]  right? X1. This is where I am right now. X180Y178. X180Y178. So I'm like right here. I'm like right
[1627.29s -> 1636.73s]  here. What are you talking about? Yeah, I'm reading this correctly. I gotta stop doing that
[1636.73s -> 1645.02s]  because people like, I look at the asshole. How many times have I like done the like, I'm like
[1645.02s -> 1652.78s]  coming into the camera. Like I'm going into the camera. Okay. So I just have to go this way. So
[1652.78s -> 1667.43s]  let's go that way. So I need to stay at 180. So if I'm here, I need to go like this. So I need X322
[1667.43s -> 1693.91s]  and I'll adjust it. What, what, what, what? What's wrong? Is that a wall? Oh shit. Um,
[1693.91s -> 1705.90s]  so I'm at X200Y. So is this, okay. Is the dark solid? This is, is this like a solid wall? Is this,
[1705.90s -> 1716.23s]  this dark area? No. Okay. So I just have to like turn. Okay. So what if I take a picture here? Is
[1716.23s -> 1758.06s]  it safe to go that way? I think so. Okay. We're good. X322. What was that? I'm not going to hit
[1758.06s -> 1791.59s]  that wall. Okay. We're good. Put the curtains down. Curtains. X322Y186. What is A? What's A?
[1793.42s -> 1814.50s]  Angle. So this is angle. Okay. Fine. All right. Almost there. X322Y186. I'm almost at 322. So I
[1814.50s -> 1835.00s]  gotta start going 322. Almost there. All right. 133. Angle 33. What the fuck are you talking about?
[1835.00s -> 1855.64s]  322. 183. Put the curtain. I can't do the curtains. 186. I'm pretty much there. I'm gonna change the
[1855.64s -> 1895.02s]  angle. 33. 322. 186. What's that? I found something. What's that thing? I gotta go down a little more,
[1895.02s -> 1913.91s]  I think. 322. I'm not quite there. Okay. No, no, no. Other way. Other way. Other 322. I gotta go
[1913.91s -> 1936.47s]  this way. 322. And then I have to go up. 322. 186. So I have to go up or down. I don't know. You don't
[1936.47s -> 1978.74s]  have to be perfect. Oh, okay. I'm almost there. 186, right? 33. The rock. Do I just go forward?
[1978.74s -> 1991.02s]  Oh, I got it. That was it? Oh, shit. All right. That was good. So we're gonna go from here to here.
[1991.02s -> 1997.54s]  So I got the picture, right? Do I have to print this? Or does it, does this count? Like, do I have
[1997.54s -> 2009.13s]  to print this out? No. Okay. All right. Counts. All right. So now I'm gonna go 378. 263. I think
[2009.13s -> 2022.44s]  I can just do this. Wait, am I gonna crash into the rocks? Oh my god. Okay. I need to turn. Just
[2022.44s -> 2072.95s]  move out of the way. 378. 263. 378. 263. Game saved. That means something happened. I'm almost
[2072.95s -> 2091.69s]  there. All right. Let's go up a little higher. 263. All right. All right. All right. 363. Let's
[2091.69s -> 2127.93s]  go more to the right here. 378. Angle 50. So what's here? Got another rock formation? Yep. Okay.
[2127.93s -> 2144.12s]  Anything here I need to see? Make sure I get a closer look. There's like a slug there. Okay. I
[2144.12s -> 2153.22s]  got it. So how, where, so I, should I, okay, I'm thinking head up this way and wrap around
[2153.22s -> 2165.56s]  and end like down here. Or go this way and wrap around and end here. I wonder. I think I'm gonna
[2165.56s -> 2178.95s]  go up this way. This way seems like a good route. Or this is, what's closer? Okay. This is 259. 406.
[2178.95s -> 2203.88s]  So I gotta go up. Yeah. 406. We gotta go up high. Hey, it's all right. No, I'm not near it. 406. Stop,
[2203.88s -> 2222.78s]  stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. What is it? What's wrong? All right. It's just a
[2222.78s -> 2254.73s]  brush. It's just a little bit of brush. 406. I gotta be careful. I gotta change this to 259. So
[2254.73s -> 2265.29s]  I gotta go 304. So I gotta go left a little bit. Hang a left. Wait, why is that? Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
[2265.29s -> 2277.77s]  That's a wall, dude. I mean, it's, it was, it was like, what does that mean? How do I increase
[2277.77s -> 2298.34s]  oxygen? Okay. Fuck. What's that? I'm not gonna, whoa. Oh my goodness. Okay. Wait. Turn, turn,
[2298.34s -> 2326.82s]  turn, turn, turn. Okay. Can I go around? How do I get oxygen? I'm almost at the right height here.
[2327.46s -> 2338.98s]  Okay. That's fine. 406. So I'm like, where am I? 2378. So I'm here. I need to just go left now,
[2338.98s -> 2360.10s]  but I have to wrap around. Oh damn. Where am I? I'm like in a cavern. Can I go this way? Am I
[2360.10s -> 2367.03s]  gonna hit this? How, how close do I have to be to hit something? All right. Pull it back a little.
[2367.03s -> 2383.66s]  Turn your lights off. I can't. Yeah. I gotta, there's something in the way here. I gotta go
[2383.66s -> 2398.63s]  all the way around it. What number I'm looking for? Looking for 259. God damn. That's far. And
[2398.63s -> 2414.20s]  then I'll have to go down. All right. And then I'm going to wrap around and go down. It's scary.
[2414.20s -> 2432.76s]  Okay. Um, should I go? I'm gonna have to go this way still. Oh, fuck. Can I make it through this?
[2432.76s -> 2438.25s]  Can I make it through this? If I just like sneak through, can I make it through that?
[2438.25s -> 2458.62s]  That's a wall. Is it a wall? Like a full wall? Shit. It's a big wall. How do I get around this?
[2458.62s -> 2477.66s]  Fuck. How do I approach this? Use the map. But I thought you guys said that the dark outline
[2477.66s -> 2491.34s]  didn't mean anything. I asked. I said, are these walls? And everyone said, no, the white is the
[2491.34s -> 2497.18s]  walls. Oh, I asked if this was important. I thought this was just like a, like pools or something. I'm
[2497.18s -> 2503.27s]  inside of this area. All right. I thought this was like, like a interesting looking map. All right.
[2503.27s -> 2507.11s]  I get it. All right. But I asked like, are these walls? Is this like solid? And everyone was like,
[2507.11s -> 2520.12s]  no, no, no. I asked if these were walls. It was the reverse. The pools is the ocean. How am I
[2520.12s -> 2525.02s]  supposed to get here then? Why did you guys tell me to go this way? I can't even go up here. This
[2525.02s -> 2535.78s]  is blocked off. All right. Okay. All right. Let's fucking go. So right now a 312, 457, 312, 457.
[2535.78s -> 2547.82s]  I'm like here, here, 457. All right. So I'm like looking at this wall right here. So if I go all
[2547.82s -> 2558.26s]  the way left and pull it this way, I should be all right, right? If I go like this, this should be
[2558.26s -> 2574.81s]  okay. Dude, the shit got real thin. All right. Here we go. You guys confused me. I thought you
[2575.05s -> 2590.66s]  all right. I had from the very beginning. All right. I'm close now. 259, 406. So I need to kind
[2590.66s -> 2646.34s]  of pull it up this way a little. There's something like, what the fuck is going on? What is this?
[2646.34s -> 2723.10s]  What's the angle? 296. What is that? What the fuck is that? Oh, did I not get a picture of it?
[2723.10s -> 2763.94s]  406. Do I have to get closer? Oh, angle 259. Okay. But it's 259 to angle 296. Oh fuck. I'm mixing
[2763.94s -> 2774.97s]  them up. I have to go this way though backwards. I navigation is like, I don't fucking do it. Like
[2774.97s -> 2782.95s]  I can't like plot land and shit. Like I give me a fucking dodge roll and I'll beat ever again.
[2782.95s -> 2817.00s]  259. All right. This is close enough. So now I need 296. All right. So what is that? Oh shit.
[2817.00s -> 2830.47s]  I have to navigate out of here. It's the worm. Okay. So now I got to go. If I keep going down
[2831.11s -> 2838.60s]  and wrap around, I'll get there because I don't, can I, can I get up here this way?
[2838.60s -> 2847.69s]  I wonder if I can go up there or should I try to just go? I have to go this way. Maybe I can.
[2847.69s -> 2870.98s]  I'll try because I'm like right here. Is there like a disconnection on the map? No, I can't.
[2870.98s -> 2873.70s]  All right. I can't. All right. All right. So I'm going to turn around and go down
[2873.70s -> 2896.89s]  because I'm like right here. I'm just going to go straight down. Use the third dimension.
[2896.89s -> 2904.26s]  That sounds like something they said in like 1995 or like 1996 or like a man, like a character.
[2904.26s -> 2907.62s]  So like you use the third dimension and it's like, oh, they turn into like
[2907.62s -> 2920.63s]  3d like Homer Simpson did. Okay. So I'm at two 56, 377. I'm three 70. I'm like here.
[2920.63s -> 2936.97s]  So I got to pull it to the right a little head this way. Uh huh. I know. I know. I'm like right
[2936.97s -> 2961.26s]  on the edge here. All right. Two, two 80, three 38, two 80, three 38. I'm like right here. So I
[2961.26s -> 3001.56s]  got to keep going down to the right. Okay. Nothing. Are you real? A CG character can't do that. Okay.
[3001.56s -> 3007.83s]  We're not at CG technology where, where like they can do this and it looks like that CG doesn't look
[3007.83s -> 3015.02s]  like that. See like skin. They don't have the technology to do skin yet. No, they don't like
[3015.02s -> 3022.10s]  hair. No, that's real hair. CG hair. It looks fucking ridiculous. All CG hair looks like the
[3022.10s -> 3042.06s]  person's underwater moving around. Sorry. I'm real. Look at this. CG can't do that yet. This
[3042.06s -> 3050.94s]  guy's jiggle physics are insane. You can't be real. You don't understand basic geometry.
[3050.94s -> 3059.48s]  I don't know how many times I have to say this. When you, okay, when you're in your thirties,
[3059.48s -> 3063.96s]  I would like for you to guys to remember what you did in high school. I have not.
[3063.96s -> 3067.82s]  Okay. When you, when you're out of like high school, you're out of college, you've been out
[3067.82s -> 3075.48s]  of a classroom for like fucking 15 years. There is no, there was no thing that I am ever doing
[3075.48s -> 3083.27s]  in my life that needs me to plot X and Y ever for any fucking reason ever. It's not like, oh,
[3083.27s -> 3089.14s]  hey, man, what are you doing today? Well, you know, plotting X, Y and angles. No, I'm cooking.
[3089.14s -> 3096.55s]  I'm doing my taxes. I'm doing fucking chores. I'm sleeping on the couch. You know what I mean?
[3096.55s -> 3106.30s]  It's there's no, there's no reason why I would ever do this. It's been like 20 years and you're,
[3106.30s -> 3113.38s]  you, I can't tell you the hard drive starts to fill in other shit and like geometry too is you
[3113.38s -> 3120.84s]  keep moving and it gets lost. The hard drive writes over it. When you're 30 fucking five, you, whoa.
[3120.84s -> 3125.08s]  When you are 35, you tell me how you do, but yeah, I got it. I could plot the fucking right
[3125.08s -> 3138.33s]  angle of a fucking acute triangle. No, you won't. No, you got more important shit to worry about.
[3138.33s -> 3156.44s]  Like, you know, like how long the grass is outside and like, is there a hummingbird that you saw?
[3156.44s -> 3162.55s]  And what's, what's the early bird special at the breakfast place? When I go to the early bird
[3162.55s -> 3166.39s]  special, the breakfast place, the, the waiter or waitress doesn't come over and give me a worksheet
[3166.39s -> 3170.79s]  and say, Hey, can you solve for X? No, they go, here you go, sir. Here's two sunny side up eggs.
[3170.79s -> 3184.66s]  Okay. Where am I? Three, six, three, two, eight, four, three, six, three, two, eight, four. I'm like
[3184.66s -> 3202.73s]  here. He's 63. All right. I gotta go up a little. Okay. Ooh, easy. Where am I? Three, seven, six,
[3202.73s -> 3212.22s]  two, nine, two, three, seven, six, two, nine, two. All right. I'm like right here. So I gotta
[3212.22s -> 3234.84s]  go up a little more. I'm not going to hit this. Right. Three, eight, six, three, 14, three, eight,
[3234.84s -> 3249.08s]  six, three, 14. Okay. I think I can just go up a little and then write a lot of people's jobs
[3249.08s -> 3272.26s]  involve geometry. So do the geometry job. Are you mad at me? What just happened? What's going on?
[3272.26s -> 3292.84s]  How do I fix this? How do I fix this? What happened? Do I have to fix that? Four? Okay.
[3292.84s -> 3301.96s]  I'm through the tunnel. I think four 38, three 22. I'm through the tunnel. All right. So I'm right
[3301.96s -> 3307.58s]  here. So I just kind of have to go like right. And then down. So we'll go like this and go
[3307.58s -> 3329.30s]  get to solve equations. So I need to hit five 60. Okay. You need to solve the math quiz.
[3329.30s -> 3339.19s]  Now these, all these math problem, Andy's, they tell me, Oh, I got to solve a math problem.
[3339.19s -> 3350.15s]  I know how to do math, math problem, Andy. I'm sorry. 500, 300. All right. I'm close. 500,
[3350.15s -> 3351.19s]  five 62 77.
[3387.62s -> 3419.93s]  I've 62 77. I gotta go up. Did I pass it? Two 77. Oh, this way. All right. I'm almost there.
[3419.93s -> 3430.12s]  Let me see. What does this person say? It should be like, I ain't never going to use the Pythagorean
[3430.12s -> 3434.60s]  theorem and then stream for a living. Like you are right. But regular people, sane people use it
[3434.60s -> 3451.75s]  sometimes. No, don't quit the game. I didn't always stream for a living. Even worse. I was
[3451.75s -> 3461.35s]  a substitute teacher. Do I need to know the Pythagorean theorem to do this? No, who cares?
[3466.04s -> 3474.87s]  Whatever. Whatever. I don't care. I win. I win. I win. All right. 43, five 60. I'm there. So I need
[3474.87s -> 3483.51s]  to turn to 43. But the Pythagorean theorem, man, like, what are you talking about? I don't need to
[3483.51s -> 3487.99s]  know the Pythagorean theorem to order from the Wendy's drive-through. Like who cares?
[3492.04s -> 3497.32s]  Like, okay. I understand. If you're like a contractor, you're like a architect or something,
[3497.32s -> 3501.88s]  right? Or you're like making blueprints or you're like doing work in like 3D design. All right.
[3506.07s -> 3522.02s]  It's specific work. That's like a big fish. Did I get it? Okay. I got it. So we got to go.
[3522.02s -> 3536.14s]  Wait, I want to see another angle of this. That was crazy. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm a clown for a
[3536.14s -> 3541.58s]  living. Do you? Okay. When the clown blows... Do you understand what you're fucking, what you're
[3541.58s -> 3547.91s]  asking, who you're talking to? Do you understand who you're talking to right now? Like, honestly,
[3548.63s -> 3553.83s]  like if you do go to the clown show or the magician show and they do like balloon animals,
[3553.83s -> 3559.11s]  you don't like raise your hand and the clown's like, all right, yes, you. Um, can you like solve
[3559.11s -> 3564.57s]  this for X? The guy's going to be like, what do you want from me? I don't fucking do that.
[3566.68s -> 3570.04s]  I don't. I fucking make balloon animals for a living. What do you want me to do?
[3572.97s -> 3580.17s]  No, you're not going to have like the clown do like a fucking complex math problem. All right.
[3580.17s -> 3604.33s]  So we're going to go down here. This is open water too. All right. 55. Let's go here. Why is this?
[3604.33s -> 3613.64s]  What if he's a math clown? You'd get booed. A math clown would get fucking booed off the stage.
[3614.52s -> 3627.58s]  Are you serious? He comes out up there like, I can't. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. So you see the
[3627.58s -> 3631.66s]  right angle here. What I want you kids to do is I want you to take out your pens and papers and I
[3631.66s -> 3637.34s]  want you to write down. This is 90 here. Okay. And then this is just 180 times those three angles
[3637.34s -> 3643.66s]  together. And I want you to solve, uh, what the area is. It'd be like kids start crying.
[3644.30s -> 3648.18s]  Kids would be fucking crying in the audience. You're going to make a bunch of kids cry.
[3650.73s -> 3655.70s]  The parents would leave shitty Yelp reviews. It'd be like we ordered a clown and the guy did like
[3655.70s -> 3663.51s]  math problems and like it was fucking terrible. I wish I could have gotten my money back. 613.
[3664.31s -> 3690.50s]  What's the 190? Okay. I'm on the right track. All right. I'm getting there. 197. That's literally
[3690.50s -> 3699.62s]  a family guy joke. You stole that from the show. No, I, I, guys, I don't, I didn't, I didn't, I,
[3699.62s -> 3705.14s]  no, I didn't. No, I didn't. That's not even in family guy. That's not in family guy. You're a
[3705.14s -> 3722.15s]  liar. Okay. 55. It's not. No, it's not. The thing is everybody will believe you because family guy,
[3722.15s -> 3726.31s]  like that could be a family guy joke and everyone will believe you because family guys made a bunch
[3726.31s -> 3733.88s]  of just like random references to every single thing ever. Skeleton, the rib cage or something.
[3734.52s -> 3761.64s]  I need to get a little closer. 613. One nine seven. Okay. Is that close enough?
[3762.28s -> 3785.64s]  195. All right. 55. Is that close enough? Holy shit. It's like a dinosaur. Hold on. Holy shit.
[3785.64s -> 3801.50s]  Okay. Wait a little more. Whoa. That's kind of cool. All right. This is going to be a pain in
[3801.50s -> 3810.89s]  the ass. Um, so if I go from here, I just go that way. I don't want to crash into this though.
[3811.45s -> 3821.82s]  That's kind of cool. I even checked for scurvy. I'm kind of concerned as I drink like a green
[3821.82s -> 3832.34s]  tea drink that has like vitamin C. I'm fine. All right. Let me just make sure I know where I am.
[3832.34s -> 3842.55s]  640 195. 640 195. So I'm like here. So from now just go boink. I should be fine for a little while.
[3843.43s -> 3862.14s]  I'm confused about what's happening. Uh, I am somebody that is locked in this submarine
[3863.37s -> 3866.97s]  and it's my job to go take pictures of anomalies that are on the bottom of the ocean.
[3867.69s -> 3874.33s]  All life has been removed from the planet. Uh, and I, there's like a space station that they have
[3874.33s -> 3878.73s]  created and then people that were on space stations, um, stay alive, I guess. Cause like
[3878.73s -> 3889.85s]  everything on planets died. I don't know. It's interesting. All right. I should slow down here.
[3889.85s -> 3909.14s]  Seven 10 eggs, seven 10, two 50, seven 10, two 50. I'm about right here. All right. Still on the
[3909.14s -> 3918.17s]  right path. Keep going. I'm going to, this is going to be so hard to navigate this little hole.
[3918.89s -> 3935.05s]  Okay. I think so it's seven 32, two 70, seven 32, two 70. I'm like here. All right. So this
[3935.05s -> 3967.37s]  should be all right. Now I just have to just weave through this. Yo, are you scared? Yeah,
[3967.37s -> 3977.30s]  it's kind of weird. Okay. Seven. I gotta make sure I'm in the tunnel, which I might not be.
[3978.28s -> 4033.82s]  Two seven 62 68. I'm in the tunnel. I'm like right here. Yep. All right. Easy. Seven
[4035.35s -> 4046.81s]  all right. I think I'm in seven 88, two 71, seven 88, two 70. All right. I'm like here.
[4046.81s -> 4050.76s]  So I gotta go right and then yeah. Okay. We're good. We made it through.
[4053.91s -> 4071.96s]  What the fuck is a wall right there? Where am I? Huh? Eight. Okay. Eight, two 75,
[4071.96s -> 4098.47s]  800, two 75. Where is this birth canal? I'm going to be coming out of the birth canal. Just wait.
[4099.03s -> 4126.12s]  Okay. Eight 64, two 58. Getting there. This is kind of far out of the way.
[4135.59s -> 4187.32s]  Eight 64, two 58, two oh nine eight. I'm close. What is that? Eight 64,
[4188.89s -> 4211.16s]  two 58. Eight 60. I gotta get closer. How am I gonna get closer? Eight 64, two 58.
[4213.38s -> 4256.82s]  Is it this? Should I just turn the angle a little? It's like a log in the way. Am I not in the right
[4256.82s -> 4280.92s]  spot? Eight 64, two oh nine. Eight 64, two 58, two oh nine. I mean this is like almost exactly
[4280.92s -> 4295.80s]  where it is. Oh I got it. That was weird. What is that? It's like a log. So I gotta get out of here
[4295.80s -> 4303.74s]  and go up. Oh this is gonna be a huge pain in the ass. Looked like a house. Yeah it kind of did.
[4303.74s -> 4312.54s]  It's like a building. Yeah. That was weird. All right. I gotta get out of here now.
[4319.61s -> 4335.38s]  You should crash. It's funny. All right. So I'm here. I need to go like left. Gotta be careful.
[4336.26s -> 4349.27s]  This is a little tight area too. Eight 30, 300. Eight 30, 300. Eight 30, 300. All right. I'm like
[4349.27s -> 4363.38s]  I gotta go down left here. I'm way too high up. Easy. All right. Here it is. All right. Yeah.
[4363.94s -> 4382.33s]  I think I'm in the tunnel right now. Yeah. I definitely am. What do you guys call me
[4382.33s -> 4405.72s]  facing here? What is this? I recently started watching a lot of Ludwig and watch him at night.
[4405.80s -> 4409.48s]  I fall asleep usually. I had a dream one night where I was watching myself sleeping almost like
[4409.48s -> 4416.12s]  astral projecting. Suddenly Jerma wearing a beer hat and doing his ape walk comes through the wall
[4416.12s -> 4419.88s]  above me and peeks into my brain to see if I'm dreaming about him. After seeing that he starts
[4419.88s -> 4423.40s]  after seeing that I am he starts walking through the opposite wall while he repeats
[4423.40s -> 4451.48s]  number one variety streamer. Number one variety streamer. All right. People don't minus two me.
[4451.48s -> 4461.66s]  I just read it. You didn't even comment on it. What do you how am I supposed to comment on it?
[4461.66s -> 4467.18s]  Well that was a crazy one man. That's crazy. People have fucked up dreams about me. I don't
[4467.18s -> 4491.75s]  know why. Okay. Worst one guy moment. No. No. We don't do worst one guy moment. We don't do worst.
[4491.75s -> 4497.10s]  We only do best one guy moment. I and that's not how it works. Did I just hit something?
[4497.66s -> 4513.14s]  What did I just have? What happened? I didn't hit. Nothing was on the radar. All right. Where am I
[4513.14s -> 4523.24s]  now? Five seven five sixty three fifty five sixty three fifty. I'm how did I end up up? Wait what?
[4524.28s -> 4533.30s]  Five sixty three three fifty. Okay. Right. Five sixty three three fifty. I'm here. All right. So
[4533.30s -> 4559.19s]  I just got to go up. If I see a wall be careful. All right. Is it blood? All right. Four hundred.
[4559.19s -> 4566.12s]  Why four hundred? We're about here. Five fifty six. Okay. So I just need to I'm going through here
[4566.12s -> 4574.15s]  right now. So we're going to go up and then right. What happened? What happened? What the
[4574.15s -> 4592.30s]  fuck just happened? What? What the fuck happened? Where was I? Jesus. How did I crash? I was. What?
[4601.67s -> 4617.59s]  What's going on? What the fuck's happening? I got some soft locked? How? No I'm not. It's an auto
[4617.59s -> 4640.57s]  save that. Oh shit. Oh come on. I was like halfway. I was like more than halfway through the game.
[4642.63s -> 4653.90s]  Is there a save I can pull somewhere? It's like an auto save thing. Is there an auto save that like
[4653.90s -> 4673.27s]  is in sections or something? Speed run it. Shit. That's so sad. That's so sad. Oh my god. Let me
[4673.27s -> 4683.82s]  see if I can speed run it. Fuck. That sucks. That sucks so bad. What the fuck? Okay. What happened?
[4683.82s -> 4691.78s]  I'm so. I okay. I understand the game. I'm just going to go fast and I'm going to get it done.
[4691.78s -> 4706.63s]  Go watch somebody's let's play. You can do it. See you in 20 minutes. No soft locks.
[4709.38s -> 4717.29s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? It's a tweet. Someone tell Jerma I can tell them how to fix their save.
[4717.29s -> 4724.33s]  How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? That's so funny. How do I fix my save? The dev
[4724.33s -> 4730.73s]  literally just tweeted this. All right. I'm going to refresh the dev's twitter and see if he gives
[4730.73s -> 4749.06s]  me a solution. It's in the game files. It's too late. Replace the newest auto save with a previous
[4749.06s -> 4755.62s]  one. Okay. Is it not too late? Did I? I didn't just do it. I didn't just fuck it up. Did I?
[4755.62s -> 4772.81s]  What did he say? He's so silly. Quick. He's reading. He's watching your tweets. Go. Oh shit.
[4772.81s -> 4780.01s]  He's playing it. Thank. Okay. All right. How do I do it? Jerma soft locking himself through the game
[4780.01s -> 4797.22s]  halfway is probably on brand. Okay. New tweet, new tweet. What do we got? Hold on Jerma. I'm typing a
[4797.22s -> 4810.54s]  solution. All right. He can DM them all. Yeah. You DM one of the mods. They'll help. Close the game.
[4812.50s -> 4820.81s]  I'm just going to close the game, right? Okay. Closing the game tech support. All right. Game is
[4820.81s -> 4834.41s]  closed. Okay. What do we do? What do I do? What should I do from here? Hold on, dude. I'm typing.
[4834.41s -> 4859.05s]  Okay. All right. All right. He said, I'm typing, laughing my ass off. That was a big one. Let me
[4859.05s -> 4868.09s]  see if I can get a huge one and catch it. The fan. Okay. I've got a fan going back here. That's
[4868.09s -> 4875.78s]  fucking this up. This fan is blowing the bubbles. I need to turn the fan off because it's too much
[4875.78s -> 4909.59s]  circulation of the air. Okay. Here we go. Oh, that went in my mouth. Fuck you. Got a new tweet.
[4909.59s -> 4917.27s]  The mod. Okay. VR Josh just said, LOL, did anyone get a DM of the jacket? No. Nope. Is he going to
[4917.27s -> 4930.89s]  tweet it? No, no, no. He's probably going to tweet out the solution. He's typing. What if he just
[4930.89s -> 4934.73s]  doesn't tweet ever again? What if he's just fucking with it and he just like, it's like,
[4934.73s -> 4981.62s]  oh yeah, I got you man. It just doesn't do it. We said it for like 40 minutes. Don't try this
[4981.62s -> 5005.80s]  on. God damn it. Tweet. Open the save folder in the install and open the progress file. Find the
[5005.80s -> 5012.20s]  data block called fake underscore sub and change the coordinates to something safe that I'm trying
[5012.20s -> 5025.16s]  to figure out. What? What? Open. Is this fake? It's making, is this a joke? He's making it up.
[5025.16s -> 5034.26s]  It's a joke. Okay. Open the save folder in the install. Okay. Let me do this right now.
[5034.26s -> 5046.39s]  Save folder in the install. So is it like this, like the steam folder, right? Like steam. Okay.
[5046.39s -> 5050.31s]  It's like steam, steam apps, right? I'm desperately trying to open the project to
[5050.31s -> 5054.31s]  figure out what the closest safe coordinates would be. Also, I don't know any of the mods
[5054.31s -> 5059.85s]  to DM. LOL. I never use Twitch. This is, I love it. This is fucking hilarious.
[5060.89s -> 5069.56s]  All right. So let me, it's in steam, like steam apps, right? Steam, steam apps, steam. Okay.
[5070.12s -> 5084.15s]  Steam, steam apps, program files, steam apps. Okay. All right. It's in steam, steam apps,
[5084.15s -> 5095.42s]  and then iron lung, right? Yep. Okay. Iron lung. Okay. Save. Progress. Open this with a text
[5095.42s -> 5111.85s]  editor, right? Notepad. All right. I got it. So I've got coordinates. Find the data block called
[5111.85s -> 5130.52s]  quote fake sub, fake sub, teleport true, no monster, fake sub. Okay. Fake underscore sub
[5130.52s -> 5136.60s]  and change the coordinates X and Y to something else. Oh shit. Okay. Where was I? I was 550
[5136.60s -> 5152.71s]  six. All right. I got it. How about like five, like 30, like three, like three, like 70 is 380.
[5152.71s -> 5160.70s]  What was it on the bud? Okay. I'm going to try five 30. Oh fuck. Oops. Okay. What should I,
[5161.58s -> 5175.91s]  what's like a safe thing to do right there? Okay. All right. All right. X I'm going to do five,
[5175.91s -> 5200.70s]  like 545. Y is Y is currently minus two. Z is 400. Solve for X. Fuck. New tweet. We got a new
[5200.70s -> 5216.12s]  tweet. What does it say? Oh, I gotta go like wash my mouth. 15 minutes ago, you said you will never
[5216.12s -> 5225.45s]  have to find a solution to X and Y. And here we are. I, but this is not, that's not even legit
[5225.45s -> 5232.87s]  though. What you're describing it. New tweet. This isn't, this is a completely, this is a complete
[5232.87s -> 5243.66s]  anomaly. Leave Y alone. I beg you. You need to leave Y alone. Oh shit. Okay. Try X five 60,
[5243.66s -> 5252.14s]  Y three 30. New tweet. No, wait. Z three 30. Oh, dev. Looks like you're having a little bit
[5252.14s -> 5257.00s]  trouble with geometry. Aren't you? Looks like the dev is having a little bit of trouble with
[5257.00s -> 5260.52s]  geometry. Just like, I'm, I'm dev. When was the last time you were in fucking high school?
[5262.09s -> 5268.81s]  When was I, I am going to get so validated right now. When was the last time? How, how,
[5268.89s -> 5275.59s]  when was the last time you were in high school? Bingo. Right. I keep this, this is perfect.
[5276.23s -> 5298.70s]  All right. X five 60, like five 60 with no decimal, just five 60, like 0.5 60.0 and Z three 30.
[5298.70s -> 5310.07s]  Okay. Three 30.0 done save. I'm opening the game right now. I suck at math.
[5312.78s -> 5317.34s]  I suck at math. I am in my thirties. I haven't had to do this for years. Go look at the tweet
[5317.34s -> 5321.50s]  right now. I'm going to fucking, I'm framing this. I'm literally going to frame that tweet
[5321.50s -> 5329.61s]  from dusk dev. Thank you so much. I'm so glad this happened. I'm so glad this happened.
[5330.17s -> 5356.71s]  Unbelievable. I'm going to frame that tweet. Okay. Let's go. Here we go. Are you ready?
[5358.63s -> 5390.09s]  Thank you so much. Oh, it worked. Oh yes. This is for like babies, right? Like this,
[5390.09s -> 5400.62s]  I'm not going to get like, please recycle where facilities exist. Do not drink bubble solution.
[5400.62s -> 5409.85s]  Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse with water immediately. No, I'm fine. Non-toxic
[5409.85s -> 5422.22s]  no dyes. Yeah, I'm fine. Non-toxic no dyes. I'm fine. Yeah, we're good. This is, I'm so glad.
[5422.22s -> 5432.06s]  It's just soap. I know I'm whatever. I spit it out. I put like a tiny bit right here.
[5432.06s -> 5445.02s]  So where I'm five 60, three 30, five 60, which is like right here. Three 30, which is like right
[5445.02s -> 5466.98s]  here. So I just have to go up here. Oh, dev hero. Yeah. Okay. Let me tell you something right now.
[5466.98s -> 5477.42s]  I like love, I love dusk dev games. I ain't just going to leave. No, I'm not going to play. Oh yeah.
[5477.42s -> 5499.48s]  I'm just going to go into Glover. No way. No way. No chance. I have 61, 395. So I'm like right here.
[5499.48s -> 5521.88s]  Okay. So pull it this way. So the dusk Twitter, go dust dev Twitter, go like open it right now.
[5521.88s -> 5527.75s]  He didn't tell anybody what he was doing. He's writing, try five 60, three 30. No, no, no.
[5527.75s -> 5532.07s]  Z three 30. Oh, I beg, leave me alone. I beg you. I forgot how to do math.
[5532.07s -> 5543.85s]  Somebody replied and said, are you defusing a fucking bomb? People don't know what he's talking
[5543.85s -> 5569.77s]  about. He just looks unhinged. That's so funny. Are you diffusing a bomb? I mean, we're in the
[5569.77s -> 5578.46s]  tunnel. How come you can't just have a normal play through of a game? I don't know, dude.
[5578.46s -> 5584.10s]  I feel like there's been a few Mario sunshine was a normal play through. That was a normal play
[5584.10s -> 5599.48s]  through. What happened with that one? That was fine. Okay. I think I'm through five, four 30,
[5599.48s -> 5624.09s]  five 73, four 30, five 73. I think if I spit on that, it would blow level almost. It looked like
[5626.25s -> 5634.73s]  it was really glossy. It could have been five 73, we're 28. So I'm just going to go up. I'm
[5634.73s -> 5653.14s]  right there. I'm through. Oh, geometry. I'm so fucking happy. I'm in my thirties. I haven't
[5653.14s -> 5659.67s]  done it in a lot. Yeah, I know, man. I know. And I, I'm telling you, I feel so good right now.
[5659.67s -> 5685.13s]  I feel great. I'm so happy that happened. Okay. Five 75, four 76. What was that? Five 75,
[5685.13s -> 5700.82s]  four 70. I'm like right here. So this thing is at six 23, five 20. So I got to start pulling it this
[5700.82s -> 5764.17s]  way. All right. Worms are six 23, five 20 incoming. What was that? That was like I was about to do it,
[5764.17s -> 5785.53s]  but I realized it was like not really called for 63. Whoa. It's another like dinosaur skeleton.
[5785.53s -> 5815.00s]  It's a dinosaur skeleton. I need to back up. Turn to the left. I think I'm too close. That should
[5815.00s -> 5839.03s]  be it, right? No, six 23, five 20, 63. All right. That's as close as it's going to get, man. 63.
[5839.03s -> 5856.50s]  All right. Got it. It's like another dinosaur bone. So how do I get up here? This way and up.
[5856.50s -> 5869.08s]  This is not on the map. Like, can I go this way? It looks like maybe I could. All right. I'm going
[5869.08s -> 5874.04s]  to go this way. So I just got to turn. I just have to turn. My mouth is like Sophie. I'll be right back.
[5874.04s -> 6007.93s]  Give me one second. All right. I'm back. I'm better. I'm better. Very cool. Let's go. Both
[6007.93s -> 6013.34s]  headphones have to go in. I feel better. Yeah. Now try that at home. Don't fucking do what I did. I
[6013.34s -> 6020.36s]  was trying to catch like a bubble on my like lips and like blow it back out. Didn't work. Don't do
[6020.36s -> 6026.62s]  that. Unless you're a certified professional clown like me. Well, professional in like quotes. Like I
[6026.62s -> 6037.62s]  give myself that term. All right. All right. Let's go. So where am I? I need to go just left.
[6037.62s -> 6069.77s]  I don't want to crash. He sounds kind of sad. Is he okay? Bro, I'm fine. I just ate a bunch of like
[6069.77s -> 6083.66s]  KFC. I'm good. Ah, I'd fuck an extra crispy bucket. He looks like a greasy butt. I don't care.
[6083.66s -> 6096.34s]  Whatever. All right. Five, six, five, six, one, five, 10, five, 61. So I got to go kind of left.
[6099.83s -> 6131.10s]  All right. What am I looking for? I'm looking for like four, like 350 X while staying at about 500.
[6131.10s -> 6170.33s]  Don't. Don't. Where even am I? What's going on here? I'm really close to what wall am I close to?
[6170.33s -> 6199.24s]  43514. 430. There's no wall here. What happens? Am I going to die? Okay. This bubble solution all
[6199.24s -> 6212.79s]  over my keyboard and it's like I'm sliding around it. I think I'm playing Glover with a controller.
[6212.79s -> 6217.35s]  It's soap. It's fine. It's literally soap. Like it's like I can. I got to clean the keyboard anyways.
[6217.35s -> 6225.35s]  It's probably in a while. The dev said they're going to patch the bug that I just saw in the
[6225.35s -> 6236.71s]  next update. It's fast. It's not. It's all right. Okay. Three. What am I looking for?
[6236.71s -> 6270.82s]  300 or like 350 500. All right. Keep going. Is this a wall? It's a tree. Okay. Watch out for trees.
[6270.82s -> 6330.17s]  What the? How do I get what? Five 358 519 358 519. Can I go up here? Can I actually go this way? 358
[6330.17s -> 6349.64s]  595. All right. I'm just going to go. I think I can go to the right. Can I? Am I? Is this like
[6349.64s -> 6428.70s]  not what I'm supposed to be doing? Oh shit. What is that? You're a beta male. Okay. Well,
[6428.70s -> 6435.30s]  um, correct me if I'm wrong, but a beta male is a higher version than alpha male. Beta would be
[6435.30s -> 6455.48s]  0.1. Alpha would be 0.01. So you think I fucking care? So what I get to be like a bigger, like a
[6455.48s -> 6473.18s]  more like a better version, a more complete version, not a beta male. Yeah. Yeah. You think
[6473.18s -> 6483.22s]  that's a beta? Okay. I don't know what drugs you're taking. Just wait till I get to. Yeah. Wait till
[6483.22s -> 6504.87s]  I get to release 1.0 man. All right. I think I'm through 367 619, three, wait, 619. So I'm like
[6504.87s -> 6515.45s]  right here. Let's just go up. I want Jim bro. Jerma back. Jim bro. Jerma was 10 fucking years
[6515.45s -> 6540.25s]  ago. It's never coming back. So I just got to go straight up here. This is going to be so hard to
[6540.25s -> 6576.20s]  navigate. Oh my God. So just 325 741 325 741. You just got unfazed by the fire. I mean, I saw the,
[6576.84s -> 6582.26s]  I almost said extinguisher, like fucking the pyro. I saw the extinguisher over there. So I knew it was
[6582.26s -> 6587.91s]  going to probably happen eventually. What is the baseball stream? By the way, you'll find out the
[6587.91s -> 6635.00s]  baseball stream. That's it. 741 325. What's the angle? 18. That's definitely going to get removed.
[6635.00s -> 6658.62s]  That's going to get removed from a moderator, but it was fucking crazy. Oh my God. It's a big crab
[6658.62s -> 6666.18s]  that got auto-modded. I know. I know. I know. I, but I don't get it. It was fucking weird.
[6666.18s -> 6670.34s]  It got auto-modded. All right. Whatever it was, it got auto-modded. That's all you need to know.
[6670.34s -> 6677.77s]  It was whatever. What the fuck is that? Can I get a better view?
[6677.77s -> 6691.10s]  We have to know. I have to know. What was it? Yeah. Yes. In the mod chat. That's what it was.
[6691.66s -> 6696.86s]  That's what it was. I don't, I'm not going to encourage this behavior, but I'm going to tell
[6696.86s -> 6701.34s]  you something right now. Don't fucking, this is not to be encouraged, but it was just like,
[6701.34s -> 6707.21s]  what the fuck, man? Somebody asked what the baseball stream is. And I said, whatever. And
[6707.21s -> 6710.41s]  then like, it was been like five minutes. I've been like at least five minutes.
[6710.41s -> 6715.69s]  Somebody like added that person, I think, and said he's going to shove an entire baseball up his ass
[6715.69s -> 6727.19s]  on stream. And this shit got grabbed immediately. And I read it because it's like auto-mod doesn't
[6727.19s -> 6736.79s]  delete it. It was like 20 seconds. I know. But still like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[6738.06s -> 6740.94s]  This is that, that behavior is not to be encouraged by the way. I'm just saying.
[6742.14s -> 6751.00s]  All right. So do I go left or right? I'm going to say left. So I got to go down and then right.
[6751.00s -> 6758.39s]  I don't want to encourage that kind of behavior, but like that's, it's his final stream. It's not
[6758.39s -> 6782.09s]  my, what, this person's name too. Yeah. What the fuck? The person's name was, all right, whatever.
[6782.09s -> 6789.91s]  We don't need to say the person's name because I don't, I don't want to, you can find it. I don't
[6789.91s -> 6802.90s]  know. The name was Ball Fondler. Okay. Okay. Do you want me to tell you more? Cause like, I could
[6802.90s -> 6819.51s]  tell you more. Don't encourage that behavior. That person's probably, that person's probably
[6819.51s -> 6831.58s]  timed out for like a half an hour. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[6831.58s -> 6837.74s]  Okay. Let's see what we have to go down here. Down to at least three 50, three 50 with a side
[6837.74s -> 6855.29s]  of the one 82 free 17, six 93, six 93. I'm like right here. I'm doing the TTS boys chop. I'm doing
[6855.29s -> 6872.92s]  the TTS tick-tock voice chop up. It's like the little kid way to say shut up. Come on. Streamer
[6872.92s -> 6886.65s]  is actively making modding a challenge. My mods are going to fucking revolt. I think six 60. All
[6886.65s -> 6908.82s]  right. Keep going and then bang a kind of thing. A left. Did you watch Morbius? No dude. Why would
[6908.82s -> 6916.87s]  I, you could have told me that Morbius went straight to DVD and I would be like, okay, I don't like
[6916.87s -> 6928.18s]  so like Morbius is like the Aladdin three of the Marvel universe. I don't, what do you want me to
[6928.18s -> 6950.60s]  say? I don't, I didn't, I didn't see it. One 80. Okay. Where am I? Morbius got $1.3 billion at the
[6950.60s -> 6971.21s]  box office. I know it did not. What? How he 77 60. I'm like right here. I got to pull it up a little.
[6971.21s -> 7023.22s]  There's something behind me. What's behind me? Do you hear that? I don't see anything. All right.
[7023.22s -> 7035.80s]  Do I need to go? Where am I? Six to 68, 623, 68. I'm like right here. 623 here. I got to go up and
[7035.80s -> 7057.99s]  left. Are you going to scream your Morbius reaction review at some point? Okay. What is this? Because
[7057.99s -> 7100.92s]  it's like, Oh, okay. I got to go that way. Oh shit. All right. Where am I? All right. I got it. I got
[7100.92s -> 7135.78s]  it. I'm in, I'm in 258, 658. I'm like right here. So I got to go left in a, at, at about
[7138.34s -> 7156.81s]  at about like one 80 or so. I got to take a left. I'm going to stream today. I want to drink alcohol
[7156.81s -> 7162.09s]  in the later hours. I mean, I'm going to do this. We're going to go to Glover and then if Glover
[7162.09s -> 7187.27s]  sucks, we're going to play another game. Okay. I got to go left. 201, six 80, six, no, six 60,
[7187.27s -> 7249.54s]  201, six. Okay. I'm like right here. So I'm about to hit this wall. So I got to go left. Hey,
[7249.62s -> 7317.50s]  what's going on? What the fuck is that? I got it. There's one more. It's the leak. What leak?
[7319.51s -> 7327.72s]  Am I under water? I'm not, I'm not under water right now. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm
[7327.72s -> 7359.69s]  going. Is this just chasing me? Is it chasing me? All right. Two 76, six 35, two 76. I'm like
[7359.69s -> 7393.14s]  six 35. Am I out? Two 76, six 35. Okay. Keep going. Now this way. You've hit something. He's 40.
[7393.14s -> 7399.48s]  Let him ask questions. I teleported. Three 10, six 44. Wait, what? What are you talking about?
[7400.84s -> 7419.11s]  Oh, teleported. Oh, okay. So I just got to go all the way to right. They changed the coordinates.
[7419.75s -> 7430.46s]  That's fucked up. This game's fucked up. All right. For X, I'm looking for,
[7431.10s -> 7458.57s]  I'm looking for like 450. I got a long way to go. He's fucked up. This game's crazy. Okay.
[7463.59s -> 7472.65s]  Stop pretending. This is going to be a pain in the ass. All right. So I'm at 445 and I'm 700.
[7472.65s -> 7477.98s]  So I'm right here. I'm like right here. I just got to go kind of hold this way.
[7479.00s -> 7490.58s]  Just navigate through here. Holy shit. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[7495.30s -> 7521.82s]  What the fuck are you talking about, dude? Okay. Um, oh my God. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[7521.82s -> 7529.56s]  wait, wait, wait. 492, six 89. I'm like right here. Just keep going. Right. Just keep going.
[7534.49s -> 7564.04s]  And then I'm going to go up at around five, like 40. That was like a dragon. All right. Five 40,
[7564.12s -> 7582.01s]  six 90, five 40, six 90. I'm like right here. Hey, let me go. And then once I hit about seven
[7582.01s -> 7633.08s]  55, okay. What the fuck? Seven 55, five 80, seven 50, five 80, seven 50. Right after I freeze it.
[7633.08s -> 7661.78s]  Oh, thank God. It's just wood. Six 11, seven 50, six 10, seven 50, six 10, seven. Okay. So I'm
[7661.78s -> 7677.11s]  like right here. So I gotta go like this. God damn it. Is it behind me? Why is it blinking faster
[7677.11s -> 7692.26s]  when I go this way? Dude, why is it doing that? Six 30, seven 75, six 30, like right here. Seven
[7692.26s -> 7743.74s]  75. I'm like right here. Six 50, seven 80. Okay. Keep going. Okay. All right. Seven. All right.
[7743.74s -> 7757.50s]  Almost at 800 and almost 680. All right. I'm going through 670, 680, 800, 680, 800. All right. It's
[7757.50s -> 7787.21s]  just right ahead. Whatever it is. What's the angle? 828, 295, six. Okay. Don't move. 295. What is it
[7787.21s -> 7829.83s]  again? 828. I started to like look this way and this eye, this eye. I went like, I went reverse
[7829.83s -> 7836.62s]  cross. I went frog eye for a second. I went like this. I was like, I want to be like,
[7837.67s -> 7845.13s]  am I in the right spot? And it came out. I saw like this and this at the same time.
[7845.13s -> 7856.68s]  The expedition only raised more questions than answers. Satellite images showed pieces of the
[7856.68s -> 7861.77s]  SM-13 scattered all over the bottom of the ocean trench as though it had been torn apart by some
[7861.77s -> 7866.36s]  huge beast. The wreckage cannot be reached at this time. No photographs have been recovered.
[7866.36s -> 7871.00s]  The stars shine pale as bones. The moon is a lifeless corpse. It's ocean a gaping wound.
[7871.00s -> 7878.78s]  The universe, what's left of it is dying, but somewhere in the void, there must be hope.
[7878.78s -> 7889.19s]  Frog eyed. That was fucking crazy. Yeah. I didn't think it was going to, I was like about to take
[7889.19s -> 7920.22s]  the picture. I'm like, oh, is this right? It's like I, I blinked. I heard the sound and my like right
[7920.22s -> 7929.24s]  eye got to see it. It's almost like I wasn't paying attention to the horror movie because I was like,
[7929.24s -> 7934.04s]  ah, this is a horror movie. Yeah. Whatever. It's like you take a bite of your popcorn
[7934.68s -> 7945.21s]  and then you hear and it's like something happened. I'll show it here. Imagine if I was
[7945.21s -> 7969.32s]  at the movie theater and had a bowl of popcorn. Perfect. All right. So check this out.
[7979.32s -> 7983.48s]  I was looking at my phone or something and I heard the sound and then saw it.
[7990.49s -> 8003.03s]  Look at that reaction time, man. Like Jesus look over.
[8003.51s -> 8020.22s]  Oh, we're going to go slower. Man. That's these Mike and I sure are delicious.
[8028.18s -> 8030.90s]  I'm not even looking at the fucking screen.
[8034.20s -> 8048.01s]  Not even fucking paying attention. Oh, it's always like, I was like sympathy screaming,
[8048.01s -> 8053.16s]  right? Like, cause other people in the audience is screaming. Everybody else is yelling. So like,
[8053.16s -> 8062.07s]  oh my God, something must be happening that I need to be aware of. Okay. Like imagine here,
[8062.47s -> 8075.96s]  this is like what happens. You hear like, oh, I got to react. Something horrible happened.
[8075.96s -> 8090.39s]  Okay. That was iron lung. That was fun. That was cool. I've come to clean about something.
[8090.39s -> 8095.98s]  I could not watch your entire Pokemon snap. Vaughn, you kept using the item throwing joystick to move
[8095.98s -> 8103.11s]  the guy. I didn't play that. Delete that. Oh, that was fun. So now we're going to move on.
[8103.11s -> 8107.51s]  That was iron lung. That game was supposed to be like a 45 minute experience and I made it like
[8107.51s -> 8112.02s]  three hours. Well, no, it's two hours. To be fair though, I had a, I had a glitch.
[8112.95s -> 8119.14s]  There was a glitch. I had to like 15 to 20 minutes. We had to kind of figure that out.
[8119.14s -> 8123.74s]  I had soap in my mouth. I had to get rid of it. So now we're going to play Glover.
[8126.82s -> 8136.20s]  Glover for the N64. It was ported to Steam. And I have to be very honest with you. If I'm,
[8136.84s -> 8141.75s]  we're going to have to gauge how people like this and the same rules that strawberry magic had apply
[8141.75s -> 8161.75s]  to the, the glove buddies. There's a new tweet. What's it say? Oh, Jerma's biggest jump scare.
[8161.75s -> 8166.07s]  I fixed the bundle and I fixed a Jerma's stream. Anything more I need to fix tonight?
[8169.14s -> 8176.97s]  Hold on. Wait a minute. You get iron lung plus dusk plus dusk 82. How much is that?
[8176.97s -> 8190.06s]  Is it bundle on Steam? How much is it? I got to show this. How much is the bundle? 30 bucks,
[8190.14s -> 8201.93s]  20 bucks. That's pretty sick. 20, 30. I mean, that was cool. Said like one of your friends
[8201.93s -> 8206.02s]  down and be like, yeah, I'll play this and watch them scream at the end and look at their popcorn
[8206.02s -> 8227.77s]  and then, um, like sympathy yell because everybody else is. All right, give me one
[8227.77s -> 8238.89s]  second. I'm going to put Glover up. Okay. Glover incoming.
