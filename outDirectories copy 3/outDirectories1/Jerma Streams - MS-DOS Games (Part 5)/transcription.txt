[1.14s -> 14.09s]  I just barely cleared my throat, and I saw it. I was just choked on my throat.
[19.38s -> 26.49s]  Thank you Kazzy for the 10 subs. Congratulations to all of you that got one. Now you can spam
[26.49s -> 34.54s]  Germamoon like I do. I think I've only done Germamoon like three times in the last year.
[37.14s -> 41.62s]  Is there like data on that? When was the last time I did Germamoon? One of you guys has like the data
[41.62s -> 52.68s]  somewhere. Wait, wait, what did I say? Like 10 times? No, I'm not gonna type that all out.
[53.32s -> 60.52s]  I'm not like you guys. I don't have the, I don't have the keywords for, I don't have like keystrokes,
[61.32s -> 67.88s]  key mapped. I don't do any of that. I type it out. I actually physically type out like Germamoon,
[68.84s -> 81.83s]  and then I copy it and paste it. Me too? I'm not the only one? Good. But hope you're having a good
[81.83s -> 92.07s]  day. Welcome back. If you were here last night, good morning. But it's, it's almost four o'clock,
[92.07s -> 96.87s]  so it's not the morning anymore. But anyways, how are you? We're gonna do some DOS tonight.
[100.66s -> 107.83s]  Pick back up, because I really do enjoy this so much. Playing these DOS games is seriously
[107.83s -> 113.27s]  like one of my, it's one of my like most favorite things to add to the stream. I,
[114.82s -> 118.58s]  I get energy off of this shit. I like live off of these old fucked up games.
[119.46s -> 133.30s]  How am I feeling? I'm feeling pretty good. And then tomorrow we're gonna do Terraria again.
[135.30s -> 140.98s]  Mr. Star is gonna boot his server back up, and we're gonna kind of pick up what we left off there.
[145.22s -> 149.86s]  And then Sunday, I have not decided what's gonna happen on Sunday, but I'm probably not gonna
[149.86s -> 161.19s]  stream, because I have to leave. I have to be, I have to really get ready, because it's a very
[161.19s -> 181.32s]  important trip early next week. Leave, leave. He's going to Texas. No, Texas. No. For those of you
[181.32s -> 186.60s]  that were not here yesterday, I will go briefly. And then I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I gotta make
[186.60s -> 192.58s]  one of those exclamation point carnival, just so I can have like a clip of me talking about it.
[192.58s -> 199.42s]  Remember when I was moving to Vegas? All right, somebody clip this. Ready?
[202.63s -> 207.93s]  I gotta kill the audio here. Hold on. I'm gonna get this in one shot.
[211.05s -> 215.85s]  Hey, you clicked this because you're probably wondering why somebody wrote a hashtag carnival
[215.85s -> 222.49s]  in the stream chat. Let me tell you. September 21st is the carnival stream. Well, the carnival
[222.49s -> 225.85s]  stream, you know, the one that I talked about previously of you guys controlling twitch
[225.85s -> 230.41s]  controlled robots to play all kinds of fun midway games and carnival games, including
[230.41s -> 249.16s]  dunking me in a dunk tank. That's right. You ruined it. Yeah, you gave $50. That was going so well.
[249.16s -> 254.55s]  And then I Oh, you guys didn't hear the sound. I did. There's not even any any
[254.55s -> 262.97s]  message here. I said hashtag. Oh, fuck. But all jokes aside, that was mandem requiem.
[263.99s -> 272.01s]  50 bucks. Thank you so much. $50. You cut me off. But I will take a $50 cut off.
[273.98s -> 280.50s]  Because that's an insane amount of money. Thank you. The clip is fucked up now.
[281.64s -> 293.61s]  Here we go. I'll give you like an easy one. September 21st 2019 is a day for
[293.61s -> 300.09s]  you to remember. That's the set in stone carnival stream date. The one where you're
[300.09s -> 305.13s]  going to have fun with robots at a twitch controlled carnival stream. That's right,
[305.13s -> 313.66s]  you're going to be in control. September 21st 2019. Maybe we'll see you there. And up until then,
[313.66s -> 319.02s]  I'm going to be traveling back and forth to a different state to make sure I get this
[319.02s -> 322.94s]  thing hammered down completely. So you might see streams pulled back, you might see streams
[322.94s -> 328.22s]  canceled up until the 21st. But you'll know in advance. Don't worry about that. I'm jumping
[328.22s -> 333.82s]  down. I'm spending I'm working on it. I'm working on it. And I'm putting time into it. Thank you
[333.82s -> 342.86s]  for listening. All right, there you go. This is I don't care. Just use that one. I'm not going to
[342.86s -> 351.05s]  redo that one. I'm almost fine. This is not the Vegas one again. I just use the first one and
[351.05s -> 363.88s]  just like cut it. He's doing the Disneyland safety guide voice. Yeah, that's the voice acting voice.
[369.30s -> 375.86s]  Make sure to keep your arms and hands inside the vehicle. And by any means, do not get out of the
[375.86s -> 383.14s]  ride. Do not take any photos with flash photography. And do not take off your shoes. Too many people
[383.14s -> 404.81s]  been doing that lately. Keep them on. This is not a red eye from Boston to LA. Anyway. Hey, look at
[404.81s -> 414.28s]  that. Look what's on the screen right now. Well, not right now. In a second. Hold on. Just wait.
[414.84s -> 421.80s]  You'll see it. No, you know, fuck it. No, no, no, no. No, fuck it. We're just going to open up this
[421.80s -> 429.56s]  one. Yeah. Here we go. We're going to open. This is streamers choice. I remember the last couple
[429.56s -> 434.30s]  times we've done this. It's been streamers choice. Streamers choice is going to be tubing.
[434.86s -> 447.03s]  You heard it here first. Tubing. All right, you can open your eyes now.
[447.90s -> 457.61s]  Tubing. Published by Dumark. Limited IBM version. Written by Hank Gecko. Okay. VGA.
[473.59s -> 482.07s]  This is the song. Cut it. Cut it. Cut it. This is the song that in my mind is what it sounds like
[482.07s -> 499.75s]  when your computer gets a virus. I need to turn this down. Just go. All right. There we go. We're
[499.75s -> 515.21s]  fine. Tubing. Is this an arcade game? How do I move? W-A-S-D. Hey, what did I tell you about
[515.21s -> 531.64s]  keeping your shoes on? How do I move? J-K-L-V-D-B-M. Space. Q. Okay. Q is turn. Q. Okay. I tilted my
[531.64s -> 538.49s]  body a little bit. I'm just like in the lazy river. Oh, those are beers. I think those are
[538.49s -> 563.46s]  like beer cans. All right. Hold on. A is turn. S maybe. Hold S. Okay. I'm dead. I have to paddle.
[563.46s -> 590.73s]  Oh my God. I actually do. Throw the beer can at it. This is so sloppy. Why am I going this fast?
[590.73s -> 595.90s]  They did this shit in Super Mario RPG. That's where they got it from. I remember this exact
[595.90s -> 604.06s]  thing happening in Mario RPG. Guys, you have to hold it. You don't have to tap it. You just hold
[606.52s -> 620.94s]  it. Hey, quit fishing. Oh, come on. Come on. Let me like throw like a beer can at a fisherman.
[620.94s -> 631.96s]  That's so fucking stupid. What a menace to society this guy actually is. I didn't bring any safety
[631.96s -> 656.22s]  equipment. I love how it stretches out a little more. Those fish. A thousand points. I got them.
[656.22s -> 665.02s]  How do I get to the end? All right. I got to stay up front. That's how you win these ones.
[668.46s -> 686.60s]  Oh my God. Okay. That was kind of scary. You can get eaten by an alligator. Okay. Um, that was
[686.60s -> 698.62s]  called tubing. You are a top shot tube, dude. Enter your initials. Pretty good. Top shot tube, dude.
[698.62s -> 710.52s]  Biff. Well, that was that one. Uh, we're going to move on from this one. I don't know. This one
[710.52s -> 716.42s]  might take us a while. I don't know. I saw, I remember got streamers choice to start this out.
[716.42s -> 737.85s]  This one, uh, I never played it, but some of you probably have another virus song. Oh shit. This is
[737.93s -> 743.70s]  going to be as complicated. I thought you were going to, I thought you just had to like diagnose
[743.70s -> 750.01s]  somebody. This is too complicated. Yeah. We're going to have to sit here for like an hour to
[750.01s -> 764.18s]  do a tutorial. Wait, what? As a carpool passenger, relax and daydream your way to work. Then reality
[764.18s -> 767.46s]  in the form of a truck smacks into you. You're not seriously hurt, but you go to the hospital.
[768.60s -> 776.76s]  Wait, I'm the patient. You spend hours in a waiting room. You fill out a thousand forms.
[776.76s -> 780.84s]  You finally see it. Don't wait. After I got in a car accident, you're poked, prodded and rushed
[780.84s -> 784.76s]  through the system. They take blood run tests and send you away. You feel mistreated and out of
[784.76s -> 789.24s]  control. Time goes by your bruises heal. You put the whole experience behind you. Then the bill
[789.24s -> 794.44s]  shows up. What did they do? Who said they could do that? Shouldn't insurance cover this? Enough
[794.44s -> 799.64s]  is enough. You decide to run from public office on the platform of healthcare reform. Click the small
[799.64s -> 816.07s]  box in the upper left of this window to continue. Okay. Am I alive? I thought this was sim health.
[817.03s -> 829.22s]  Ah, how do I turn this off? Hold on. I can turn this off. Oh, it's like specifically designed
[829.22s -> 836.26s]  to hurt your ears. Before you can be elected to office, the voters need to know who you are,
[836.26s -> 839.94s]  what you stand for, what you believe in, your personal values. I thought this was a surgery
[839.94s -> 846.87s]  game. The values window will show you a number of statements. You rate how much you agree or
[846.87s -> 851.83s]  disagree with each statement from your answers. Sim health will establish your personal values.
[853.86s -> 864.18s]  Why is this game like 30 years ago and like 30 years in the future? This is some weird
[864.18s -> 869.58s]  shit here. Okay. Your constituents and the simulation will judge you not by the values
[869.58s -> 880.73s]  you select, but how well you stick to them. Okay. Why? Wait, why? I thought this is a health game.
[883.77s -> 890.65s]  Sim health defines personal values as a balance between four ideals, liberty, equality, community,
[890.65s -> 901.78s]  and efficiency. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Individually, each of these four ideals sounds
[901.78s -> 905.86s]  great, but you can't have it all. Completely supporting anyone takes away from the others.
[906.74s -> 919.80s]  So I got hit by a truck and decided to run for president? Is that what happened? Okay. Liberty
[919.80s -> 923.64s]  and equality are at the opposite poles. The more liberty you have, the less equality. Community
[923.64s -> 928.68s]  and efficiency are also opposing forces. As you choose your values, consider how the four different
[928.68s -> 944.01s]  ideals can work together. Okay. Now what? You've represented with four conditions. Oh God. No,
[944.01s -> 949.43s]  I don't, you're not going to do, you know, I'm not going to play like the saw game right now.
[949.43s -> 956.63s]  You have four choices. Each one describing four crisis points. Make your choice. I don't know
[956.63s -> 964.57s]  if I want to do this. In the first room is a man who's just like you was hit by a car,
[965.21s -> 976.33s]  choosing him, removes both of his legs. In the other room, two families, one of which
[978.95s -> 983.35s]  shit the bed last night. What are you, what, make no choice. I don't, I'm not doing this.
[993.37s -> 998.49s]  Yeah, that joke was ruined because I couldn't come up with like a safe way to have to have
[998.49s -> 1003.46s]  you press the button on the family. You know what I mean? Like I had to abort that one.
[1004.02s -> 1008.86s]  There's no, like there's no way I could have, I could have turned that around.
[1015.56s -> 1022.14s]  I had to, I had to get that away from that one. All right. Anyways, let's go. I'll do one.
[1045.50s -> 1059.93s]  I'm fucking out of this. I'm not doing this. I'm not exploring the United States healthcare system.
[1062.68s -> 1078.55s]  Oh, was that the Willy Wonka song? Willy Wonka, the famous chocolatier. Hey,
[1079.51s -> 1085.94s]  this is the same song.
[1107.88s -> 1125.62s]  This is a binaural beats in my fucking head. Mr. Three, the bomber, dead eye. Mr. Three,
[1126.42s -> 1137.22s]  skill level one. Target. Yeah. Hello and welcome to the All-Star Basketball Association's three
[1137.22s -> 1142.82s]  point shooting championship. I'm Skip Smiley. The world's best shooters are here to settle once
[1142.82s -> 1146.66s]  and for all. That guy on the right can't believe he's on camera. The winner will have his name
[1146.66s -> 1152.50s]  engraved on the championship trophy alongside the name of last year's champ. Okay. That guy
[1152.50s -> 1158.26s]  clearly didn't have any lines. He just won the, that guy won the contest to be on stage with the
[1158.26s -> 1169.00s]  guy that people think is cool. All right, here we go. Joining me is the ever exciting Rick Vitality.
[1169.00s -> 1174.68s]  He will be giving us expert analysis as the championship goes on. Glad to be here, Skip.
[1174.68s -> 1180.36s]  It's going to be three point city, baby. Without any further ado, let's have a look at this year's
[1180.36s -> 1186.04s]  field. Same guy. Just that's the same guy. Here's the thing. I got to show this on camera. Same guy,
[1186.04s -> 1192.98s]  except the one difference is he turned his mouth to the side. Is it you go from this to this,
[1192.98s -> 1198.86s]  all you do is just turn your mouth. Is it just like tilt your mouth and talk out of the side of your
[1198.86s -> 1215.11s]  mouth. I didn't turn the face cam on. Whoops. Oh, well that looks like a strong field to me.
[1215.11s -> 1219.75s]  What do you think, Rick? This is going to be an exciting tournament. We should see some
[1219.75s -> 1226.15s]  fantastic shooting. Any predictions for the first round, Rick? Barclay might as well pack his bag.
[1227.59s -> 1231.99s]  You know, the muffins, when some muffins have the guy underneath with the real hands,
[1233.35s -> 1236.55s]  that he is out of his league. It's two puppeteers.
[1236.55s -> 1245.11s]  We'll win easily. Long Poppin' is going to say bye bye to Johnson. No problem at all.
[1246.15s -> 1253.43s]  I'll take Thomas in a close one over, Mr. Three. Anything you say, Rick. Well, let's go down to
[1253.43s -> 1261.59s]  the court as the first round is ready to begin. Okay. Bald Barker. This is not me.
[1262.95s -> 1269.11s]  We don't have to sit here and actually watch this, right?
[1277.05s -> 1338.74s]  Deal. I'm playing that fucking dumb game. All right, let's go. I got pretty bad picks so far.
[1338.74s -> 1347.99s]  I'm not gonna lie. The first two, three games, pretty bad picks. Let's see if I can pull this
[1347.99s -> 1369.37s]  out here with... This one might be all right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why did I pick... No,
[1369.37s -> 1377.42s]  I didn't. I didn't do like more of these, did I? It's another fucking politics game. It better not
[1377.42s -> 1394.07s]  be. How was I... Look, the name of this game is Floor 13. Not anything to do with like politics.
[1395.32s -> 1399.64s]  I thought this was gonna be like a scary game or like a point and click horror game or something.
[1407.70s -> 1435.96s]  What? Okay. How do I go? Welcome new DG. Decor style. Modern or traditional?
[1437.75s -> 1442.87s]  Modern. Please type the name... Please type your name in block capitals.
[1443.51s -> 1450.39s]  I'm sorry. I mean, I do appreciate the fact that you give me the form, but I'm...
[1451.19s -> 1455.43s]  It's kind of a sleazy way to give me your Mario Maker level. I don't do that,
[1456.31s -> 1476.52s]  but thanks for the deed to the house. I appreciate it. That's not how I sign. Okay.

[1524.12s -> 1532.97s]  yourself unless you enjoy flying. I want to see results in three weeks. Is it on my house?
[1535.48s -> 1552.47s]  Okay. Let's go in the office. Read reports. See polls. Suspects. Groups. All right. Okay.

[2000.63s -> 2013.08s]  too. Call me bomb for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits just came in. 5,000 bits. They say, hey man,
[2013.08s -> 2017.24s]  I'm not great at Twitch. Just want to send you a little something. You've helped me deal with the
[2017.24s -> 2026.12s]  stress of nursing school and now I'm an actual pediatric nurse. There you go. Hell yeah. You
[2026.12s -> 2030.28s]  help a lot of people and you mean a lot. You mean a lot to us as well. Thanks for all the laughs,
[2030.28s -> 2034.60s]  buddy. Also dodge right when you fight the abyss walkers in Dark Souls 3. Thanks.
[2039.46s -> 2044.89s]  Always dodge left. Have to dodge left every time, but congratulations. That's awesome.
[2045.69s -> 2050.57s]  Actual. I told you guys, doctors are in here. Everybody. Everybody talks about, hey man,
[2050.57s -> 2054.73s]  you always bring up how there's doctors in your chat. Uh, we got another person in the medical
[2054.73s -> 2072.78s]  field here. Nurse, doctors, scientists. Uh, thank you. Prime minister says, ah, don't attack people
[2072.78s -> 2078.38s]  with high public profiles or the chattering classes will start asking questions. Get serious. We'll
[2078.38s -> 2084.44s]  start flying lessons. I don't know what that means. And why am I not allowed in his house?
[2085.08s -> 2118.14s]  No, no, no, no, no. Stay here. See operations. Suspect under surveillance. Suspect being tailed.
[2118.14s -> 2126.30s]  Address marked for assault. All right. I think I've had enough of this one is to
[2135.38s -> 2142.63s]  eliminate. I might as well just see what happens. I want to see what the prime minister means.
[2152.87s -> 2160.73s]  Phone rings. Hey, my phone in my office. Hello. Uh, this is the interrogation department here.
[2160.73s -> 2165.77s]  We feel it may be a little pointless abducting Mr. James Radcliffe as corpses don't do much
[2165.77s -> 2172.14s]  talking. Yes. I'm very sorry about that. My cat ran across my keyboard. Oh, okay. No,
[2172.14s -> 2190.26s]  that happens over here too. All the time. Yeah, I know it sucks. All right. Goodbye. Bye. I need
[2190.26s -> 2196.22s]  to go to, is he still alive? All right. Let's, what happens when you just get, okay. Well,
[2196.22s -> 2199.98s]  what happens if you just get rid of everybody? Wait, no, no, interrogate, interrogate. No,
[2199.98s -> 2206.94s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop. No, don't. Okay. Tail him. This is like a Pee Wee Herman
[2206.94s -> 2218.06s]  skit going on right now. First we stab him and then we grab him and then we kill him. I say we
[2218.06s -> 2240.50s]  let him go. Next, come on. All right. Give orders. What the fuck was that? All right. Search.
[2249.38s -> 2260.79s]  Make sure you do it a couple times and then like do it sneakily because we're going to like trash
[2260.79s -> 2265.91s]  this guy's place and then after like a day or so he's going to put out all the good stuff out
[2265.91s -> 2274.09s]  and then we're going to go in there and do it discreetly and find it. All right. Let's go.
[2274.73s -> 2289.59s]  There's some new reports for you. I mean, we might as well just see this to the end
[2289.59s -> 2306.50s]  because this is... I'm doing like a fucking clown show right now. Wait, what? Uh, hold on a second.
[2308.60s -> 2315.18s]  Dave Holtz. Suspect leaves. Suspect returns at... Okay, so he went to work.
[2318.74s -> 2325.14s]  All right. He got up in the morning. He left to go to work. At 5 30 he came home from work.
[2326.07s -> 2334.92s]  At 6 51 after taking a shower, he went back to... Oh, no, no, he left. He probably went out somewhere
[2334.92s -> 2343.30s]  like the grocery store. At 8 p.m. we attacked his house while he was at the grocery store
[2343.30s -> 2356.60s]  or out to dinner and then he came back at nine. Why did we not get a reaction here? What does
[2356.60s -> 2363.08s]  that mean? Attacked? Premises attacked? Did we just like drop a fire out of his house?
[2365.32s -> 2371.99s]  Is he going to be like upset about this? The police have puzzled this. The reason for the
[2371.99s -> 2387.11s]  military-style attack on the home of Dave Holtz. We set up like turrets and like fired a fire. This
[2387.11s -> 2395.18s]  is the guy that's been dead for like four days, by the way. This guy is in the morgue right now
[2395.18s -> 2405.19s]  and I guess, unfortunately, who fortunately was not there at the time. All right, well,
[2405.19s -> 2422.25s]  let's go. Lead reports. Suspects. How would you not be suspicious of this right now? All right,
[2423.21s -> 2431.30s]  give orders that we're going to pursue. Yeah, just follow them around. That's fine.
[2438.71s -> 2445.40s]  I can't like do... Can I actually... What about removal? What does that mean? Removals?
[2452.47s -> 2472.87s]  No, no, no. Removals. Immediate removal. You can't ruin the public standing. Just run like a smear
[2472.87s -> 2484.20s]  campaign on the guy. Like this is... That's terrible. All right, I'm gonna leave. We're
[2484.20s -> 2496.98s]  currently... What about this? Lead desk. Next day. There are loads of new reports in for you. Uh-oh.
[2497.62s -> 2503.86s]  This is the part of the show when there's a big... Everything is dark and there's one giant floodlight
[2503.86s -> 2508.50s]  on the door and I'm standing way in the back and it's one big light on the door and there's really,
[2508.50s -> 2517.35s]  really creepy, nervous music playing. Loads of new reports. Okay.
[2527.70s -> 2533.46s]  Exclamation point. Removal department here. Mr. James Radcliffe already dead.
[2539.56s -> 2546.87s]  Mr. James Radcliffe already dead. Somebody typed that up real fast and didn't put proper
[2546.87s -> 2565.83s]  punctuation or spacing or anything. Stop doing that. He's dead. I can't do anything. Uh-oh.
[2565.83s -> 2572.55s]  The PM will see you tomorrow morning. I can just imagine... That's like, that's like an old person,
[2572.55s -> 2581.54s]  right? When they're writing. I come tomorrow. Pick up. They just want to get their point across.
[2582.18s -> 2591.50s]  I come tomorrow. Pick up. Food. Are you hungry? That's like, that's like, like my father talks.
[2604.95s -> 2609.19s]  Subject, okay. Subject leaves home, returns home. Subject leaves home. Subject returns subject
[2609.19s -> 2629.74s]  of 3 a.m. We got a new spot. Subject leaves home, goes to Whitehall, returns home, leaves home.
[2630.30s -> 2644.33s]  Subject arrives at Frog Street. Suspect or location file attached. Okay. So the search party found
[2644.33s -> 2650.65s]  nothing of interest at the home of Mr. Philip Bone. The search party found nothing of interest at the
[2650.65s -> 2667.05s]  home of Mr. Philip, but we left the place in a mess. That's okay. Interrogation report.
[2670.41s -> 2677.61s]  Prisoner in cell, Dave Holtz. Where is your headquarters? There isn't one. Are you
[2677.61s -> 2682.65s]  involved in a conspiracy? I have rights, you know. Are you a member of a secret society?
[2683.37s -> 2698.44s]  Do you know who you're talking to? Whoever's doing the interrogating is not really doing a great job.
[2699.45s -> 2707.96s]  You don't start with, are you involved in a conspiracy? You find that out. You figure that
[2707.96s -> 2729.03s]  out. Inactive. Oh, because it's very, very, being tailed. Uh, different disinformation unit.
[2729.83s -> 2734.01s]  So what does that do? We're just going to like lie about, we're going to spread like a social
[2734.01s -> 2739.51s]  media like rumor about him or something that he like, what are we doing? Are we like spreading
[2739.51s -> 2744.63s]  rumors, lies? Are we doing like a campaign? I don't understand what that means. Propaganda?
[2760.28s -> 2779.77s]  Yeah, get rid of that. Let's do, um, yeah. All right, let's go. Next day. Next day.
[2790.22s -> 2795.26s]  Oh, yes. The thing slides. Oh, you're welcome. Yes, sir. I just had the palace on the phone.
[2795.26s -> 2799.18s]  I don't want to your dirty work getting into the papers or your history. Do you know what
[2799.18s -> 2812.62s]  happened to the last TG? Slide. Okay, bye. It's like the fucking the land of Oz. Let me in the
[2812.62s -> 2840.38s]  house. I'm invested. Oh, we're still interrogating this guy. Where's your HQ? What do you intend to
[2840.38s -> 2845.82s]  do with that? So you have an HQ. What is your name? Dave Holtz. Who's your contact? I won't talk.
[2851.38s -> 2855.70s]  Where's your headquarters? What do you intend to do with that? Means I have a headquarters.
[2856.26s -> 2865.69s]  But why would I tell you? All right. Yeah, he's he's gonna talk. Suspect under interrogation.
[2869.00s -> 2885.74s]  Suspect focus of smear campaign. Suspect under surveillance. Okay. All right. Now keep it up.
[2890.79s -> 2911.51s]  That's all right. Let's go. Interrogate. That signature was made in MS paint.
[2920.15s -> 2925.51s]  Disinformation department here. Mr. Philip Owen has already been smeared. We can't risk the
[2925.51s -> 2938.34s]  suspicion another campaign might arouse. Okay, fine. Fine. It's more. Okay. Next report. Here we
[2938.34s -> 2946.44s]  go. Subject subject has been held for two days. Somebody's looking worn down. What is your name?
[2946.44s -> 2951.98s]  Dave Holtz. What are you? Are you involved in a conspiracy? What do you remember of a secret
[2951.98s -> 2966.12s]  society? All right. We're gonna have to let him go. How do I let him go? interrogate remove
[2967.08s -> 2971.16s]  removal? Can I like remove him from the interrogation room?
[2971.16s -> 2977.91s]  Interrogate. Like, no, no, no, no, abduct him. Abduct him. He's already here. All right, abduct
[2977.91s -> 2984.14s]  him again. All right, we're gonna we're gonna you're gonna do you're gonna like put like a
[2984.14s -> 2987.98s]  like cover it like blindfold him. And then you're gonna like spin him around a couple circles,
[2987.98s -> 2992.60s]  walk him out the door, walk him out and back into the door. Take him like on a car ride,
[2992.60s -> 3005.96s]  and then put him back in the same room. All right, and then let's do it again.
[3011.13s -> 3033.66s]  What's this guy doing? And then we're gonna bring this guy in and convince him he's the other guy.
[3033.66s -> 3045.32s]  Okay, let's see what happened. What? Interrogation department here. We're not actually sure where
[3045.32s -> 3052.02s]  Dave Holtz is. Oh, sorry, I recognize that picture. That suspect is already here.
[3052.02s -> 3055.86s]  The Prime Minister of fucking Munchkinland. We'll see you tomorrow morning.
[3056.82s -> 3070.36s]  Subject leave, subject return, subject leave, subject return, subject abducted. Did it? Hold on
[3070.36s -> 3077.98s]  a minute. Are you involved in a conspiracy? What? Are you a member of a secret society?
[3079.61s -> 3083.69s]  The National Unit of Municipal Workers are hardly a secret. Okay, where's your headquarters? There
[3083.69s -> 3106.18s]  isn't one. Okay. So, so we've got to let him go. We can we've got to let him go. Prisoner in cell
[3106.18s -> 3113.62s]  two, Mr. Philip Owen. Are you involved in a conspiracy? Up yours piss head? Who do you work
[3113.62s -> 3127.10s]  for? Doesn't say anything. What's your name? Ask my mother. Huh, okay. Give orders. Infiltration.
[3129.40s -> 3136.26s]  What is infiltrate? Oh, wait, infiltration? 100 agents.
[3143.16s -> 3150.54s]  Okay. So what you mean to say is, all of us, it's just only going to be cover agents. We're
[3150.54s -> 3154.06s]  all going to be like winking at each other and like bumping into each other like the coffee maker.
[3157.29s -> 3161.37s]  100 fucking cover agents at this place that probably only has what like 100 people in it.
[3162.01s -> 3175.13s]  Let's go. It's 250. We're going to make up a significant portion. But okay, if this 250,
[3175.13s -> 3179.69s]  what happens when 100 people get hired? We all have to get hired. How do you we can't infiltrate
[3179.69s -> 3190.12s]  that many? Does the National Union of Municipal Workers plan on expanding their workforce by like
[3190.12s -> 3206.52s]  35%? We're creating jobs. We're creating like fake inflated jobs. Okay, let's go.
[3208.79s -> 3225.42s]  Infiltration in progress. All right, let's see the polls. Oh, oh, oh, oh, we're, we're,
[3225.42s -> 3239.91s]  we're four points behind. That was 50 more dollars that came in. A lot of money coming
[3239.91s -> 3247.98s]  in today, guys. Seriously. Thank you for that. This is like another 50 fucking dollar drop.
[3249.51s -> 3260.71s]  This is from Jay Zanye West. Thank you for the 50 bucks. Due to work, I'm away from family and
[3260.71s -> 3265.19s]  friends a lot. My girlfriend and I watch your streams and content together. So watching while
[3265.19s -> 3270.25s]  I'm on the road makes me feel a little closer to home. Thanks for the amazing content. PS What
[3270.25s -> 3280.17s]  are the odds of a scare Saturday's reboot? Well, first of all, thank you. That's I'm happy that
[3280.17s -> 3286.63s]  you guys have something to connect. If it's here, if it's this community, if it's this stream, then
[3287.27s -> 3300.42s]  that makes me fucking happy. Being away from people that you love is hard. But as I'm really
[3300.42s -> 3307.03s]  happy that you and your girlfriend have that. So thank you. What are the odds of a scare Saturday
[3307.03s -> 3315.08s]  is coming back? Pretty much I would say probably zero chance. Because I would just play any new
[3315.08s -> 3320.78s]  horror game that comes out regardless. I don't think it has to be like on a set day. But I just
[3320.78s -> 3335.80s]  want to be completely and totally just open about that scare every day. So you're saying that there
[3335.80s -> 3342.28s]  is a chance there is a chance. But I really do. Oh my god. I do appreciate the $50 on top of the
[3342.28s -> 3351.93s]  other $50 that La Cranda just gave right now. Holy shit, guys. All right. Thank you La Cranda
[3351.93s -> 3356.09s]  for the 5000 bits. It took me three weeks to save up this money. I won't have enough to pay the bills
[3356.09s -> 3365.08s]  after this. But the streamer needs money. You better be paying the bills first. You better you
[3365.08s -> 3372.92s]  better be paying the bills like five times over before you give me a cent. But thank you so much
[3372.92s -> 3386.20s]  for the $50 fucking dollars. Both of you, all of you. All right, let's uh, okay, let's see what
[3386.20s -> 3394.04s]  happens tomorrow. Let's we're gonna we're infiltrating with our hundred person agent team.
[3399.06s -> 3413.18s]  Uh oh, this guy's got a lot of threats. Let me do this thing again. Remember this? Hey,
[3413.18s -> 3417.98s]  you're becoming a serious liability. Questions are being asked in the house. Do you want to
[3417.98s -> 3445.58s]  follow the last DG? Get serious or start flying. Let's see what happens. To the shredder. For
[3445.58s -> 3450.22s]  security reasons, all references to the following will be removed from our current records.
[3450.94s -> 3460.46s]  Mr. James Ratcliffe. Okay, because he's been he's been dead for like five days. All right.
[3461.82s -> 3468.06s]  Infiltration report. All assigned agents penetrated. They were on a hiring boom.
[3468.70s -> 3475.66s]  Number of agents successfully penetrated. A hundred. Initial penetration successful. Infiltration
[3475.66s -> 3486.44s]  has risen to over 25% of core membership. Now what the fuck do you want us to do? Because
[3487.08s -> 3492.15s]  a couple of issues have arisen and I'm going to bring up very briefly. Because there's so many of
[3492.15s -> 3498.76s]  us, we all try to do the same job. We all try to go to the bathroom at the same time to use our
[3498.76s -> 3504.68s]  communicators in our ears. And it just looks kind of weird when 40 people go to the men's bathroom
[3504.68s -> 3510.62s]  at the same time. And 30 people go to the women's bathroom at the same time. And we all as we need
[3510.62s -> 3540.57s]  a bit of solution will be hat will be good. We're starting to arise suspicion. What next? 40 plus
[3540.57s -> 3544.25s]  30 equals 100. No, that what about the other? Okay, what about the people that have to stand
[3544.25s -> 3558.31s]  watch outside the bathrooms? 100 people all just get up from their chairs. Like bugs to a light.
[3562.54s -> 3573.83s]  Group infiltrated. Okay. Dave Holtz has been here for four days. A member of a secret society.
[3573.83s -> 3580.63s]  That's not a secret. Well, sooner or later, it's going to be our society. Because I'm going to
[3580.63s -> 3592.26s]  send another 100 agents in there. Two-fifths of the company is infiltration. That's so
[3592.34s -> 3606.58s]  stupid. I don't have one. I don't have contact. Okay. Give orders. Now there's nobody left to
[3606.58s -> 3615.56s]  all right now let's do a disinformation campaign on the inside. You know how easy that would be?
[3616.20s -> 3622.28s]  Tell the tell the the fucking 40% of their workforce to stop trying. Just sit there and
[3622.28s -> 3626.68s]  like spin a pencil around in your hand all day. They will lose so much productivity if you guys
[3626.68s -> 3635.98s]  just like browse Reddit all day. That we could completely control this. We don't even need to
[3635.98s -> 3647.02s]  put out like a false report. Okay. Let's lead reports. Let me go look at the suspects again.
[3650.97s -> 3660.42s]  Next suspect. All right. What do we get? Under interrogation. Orders. I got to remove. How do
[3660.42s -> 3678.81s]  I get somebody out of interrogation? This is not going to work, right? This is not going to work.
[3680.41s -> 3695.75s]  Imagine if you send in like a huge military team to to where we are. Yeah, we're going to
[3695.83s -> 3707.18s]  we're sending in like a big like raid on ourselves. No. The guy's just sitting there in a chair like
[3708.38s -> 3713.50s]  waiting for the next guy to come in to interrogate me. The door opens. The creeks open like
[3714.22s -> 3724.39s]  what the hell's going on there? And fucking flash can comes in. 50 people. Come get it.
[3734.95s -> 3739.08s]  All right. Let's go to let's go to the department. Interrogate. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3743.32s -> 3755.05s]  Check captives. What does this mean? Procedure zero. Procedure one. What's procedure two?
[3755.77s -> 3775.99s]  Procedure two? Procedure two. Hold on. My cell phone plan? No, that's that's the cell. Okay,
[3775.99s -> 3787.58s]  hold on. That's the cell. That's not right. Suspects. Right. Okay. Okay. We've got there.
[3787.66s -> 3803.59s]  We're on two. Cell plan. Dental plan. Insurance. Home orders. Insurance. Okay. But anybody had no
[3803.59s -> 3819.69s]  past confessions, right? So what is phase two? All right. What about this the disinformation
[3819.69s -> 3839.32s]  campaign? I'm saying the guy was an alien. Lies. Lies. Lies. National unit slash slush funds
[3839.32s -> 3863.13s]  stand at 88,000. We're already doing this. All right. That's fine. Let's go back to the door.
[3863.85s -> 3869.99s]  So we were doing like extra interior. I don't know what that means. What is two? Procedure one.
[3869.99s -> 3882.57s]  Procedure zero. Procedure two. What does it mean? Apparently I haven't read all the reports. Yes,
[3882.57s -> 3895.94s]  I know. You send me this every day. Yeah, I've read all the reports. There are lots of new reports.
[3895.94s -> 3910.62s]  Okay. Political damage minor. Opposition MP Mr. Barry Matthews revealed a secret bill outlining
[3910.62s -> 3914.94s]  government plans to sell off national parks. The leaked document concluded that many parks
[3914.94s -> 3928.63s]  could easily be turned into golf courses and country clubs. All right. What? Um, isn't that
[3928.63s -> 3939.16s]  the same? Hold on. Mr. Barry Matthews. MP disgruntled. Suspected. Suspected affiliation
[3939.16s -> 3943.08s]  to National Federation of Labor. Suspect holds opinions not supported by the government.
[3944.04s -> 3954.62s]  Okay. There's a new suspect. Subject has been held looking pale. Okay. What's your name? Dave
[3954.62s -> 3961.98s]  Holds. What are you involved in? Who do you work for? Num W. The subject is being tortured
[3961.98s -> 3977.83s]  to British standards. No, I don't want to. What? What does that mean? Oh, they both being like
[3977.83s -> 4005.80s]  told. What is my God? What is your name? Help. How many are you? Go on punk. Make my day. All
[4005.80s -> 4019.54s]  right. I've got a group infiltrated group smeared. They're just like fighting each other.
[4021.40s -> 4025.08s]  They're just talking shit to each other. They're just making fun of each other.
[4025.64s -> 4049.75s]  What a perfect smear campaign. All right. Let's see. Suspects. But how do I, what do I do?
[4050.63s -> 4055.43s]  How do I do this? I need to like get them out of interrogation. He's been here for too long.
[4067.91s -> 4075.35s]  Removal. But is this kill? Or is this just remove? There's a dispose and then there's a remove.
[4076.23s -> 4095.58s]  All right. I have to go back to the departments. Leave desk. Interrogation. I'm going to say
[4095.58s -> 4130.10s]  dispose. That means remove is kill. Dispose is leave, right? Oh, no, no, stop, stop, stop,
[4130.10s -> 4140.46s]  stop, stop. Dispose. Remove is it's worded weirdly. Remove is kill. Dispose is get out.
[4141.18s -> 4155.62s]  Right? Or else how else would I let them out of interrogation? It's not the other way around.
[4157.90s -> 4169.14s]  You can't remove somebody. That's new reports. Let's see. Dispose is what villains ask their
[4169.14s -> 4189.56s]  henchmen to do. I know, but it's two people got fired. Boss, I was just doing the thing you told
[4189.56s -> 4200.62s]  me to do. I sat around. I played flash games. I went to the bathroom like 15 times. I told
[4200.62s -> 4220.42s]  extended breaks. Why are we? Why did we get fired? Is that it? That's it. So is he actually? All
[4220.42s -> 4239.22s]  right. Deceased. Next. So what the fuck does removal do? Yeah, I know. It's like the cartoon
[4239.22s -> 4249.00s]  villain gives his monologue at the end and says dispose of them. And then like the Batman throws
[4249.00s -> 4255.22s]  the thing and it like hits like three or four switches and then he gets trapped. I know,
[4255.22s -> 4273.51s]  but how do I get him out of the interrogation room? Hold on. What does this do? Oh, yeah.
[4273.51s -> 4288.52s]  Removal, huh? Assassinate George Cox. Yeah, that's removal. What? All right. We're going to
[4288.52s -> 4301.99s]  search his house and then we're going to tail him. I'm going to laugh my ass off if the first person
[4301.99s -> 4308.55s]  that we did like the military strike to was like the mole or whatever the whole time. And I can't
[4308.55s -> 4326.38s]  end the game because I'm softlocked. Okay, let's give orders here. Surveillance. Yeah. And we're
[4326.38s -> 4331.69s]  going to discreetly search. You know what? Just no, no, no, no, no. Discreet, discreet, discreet,
[4331.69s -> 4344.07s]  discreet, discreet, discreet. Did I already do that? Discreet. Okay. What is even the point
[4346.10s -> 4363.77s]  of like heavy assault? That doesn't seem to, why? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4363.77s -> 4377.72s]  Back it up. Couple of new reports. See if we got any info. PM, we'll see you tomorrow morning.
[4380.18s -> 4386.76s]  Mounting political damage. Matthews has again embarrassed the government. Revelations that
[4386.76s -> 4391.80s]  industrialists are receiving back handers from the government in order to exaggerate output
[4391.80s -> 4398.94s]  figures have been vehemently denied by the Department of Trade and Industry. Under surveillance
[4398.94s -> 4405.67s]  being tailed, marked research. Okay. So the other ones being we can just go to tomorrow.
[4406.39s -> 4416.73s]  I do this every time. My sludge brain just goes back into the office every day again.
[4417.45s -> 4427.42s]  Is he going to do it a third time? Is he going to do the Oz slide the thing? No, he's not.
[4427.98s -> 4437.19s]  The Prime Minister says, I don't want to read derogatory remarks about this government and
[4437.19s -> 4457.58s]  the press. Keep troublemakers quiet. I want this sorted out now. We must continue. Hold on.
[4458.30s -> 4463.24s]  Document. We must continue our plan to wreak havoc and chaos at every level of organized
[4463.24s -> 4469.00s]  government. Switch the device on in the specified place in Morton on Stanley three days before the
[4469.00s -> 4474.52s]  election. I've set down a false trail. So Philip and thus you will not be under suspicion. The blue
[4474.52s -> 4497.93s]  none. Oh, all right. Matthews is two more people got fired. I'm not even sure this is how the polls
[4497.93s -> 4513.77s]  look. Oh, we're gonna lose next suspect. Okay, so this is this is the guy that's like causing
[4513.77s -> 4534.78s]  all the other issues, right? Um, what do we do? Disinformation. No, he said I can't if I do that
[4534.78s -> 4552.71s]  again, then I'm gonna be in big trouble. I can't do it. I can't do a light. No, I remember he said
[4552.71s -> 4558.22s]  don't do that again. You're getting too much info. Let's see what happens if we do some
[4558.22s -> 4584.78s]  misinformation. Let's go. You want? No, just wait. We need to see if we can do this. Correct.
[4588.23s -> 4603.56s]  New report. Wait a minute. Subject arrives at 150 Goward Gardens. Subject returns home, leaves
[4603.56s -> 4614.36s]  home, goes to the pub, leaves the pub, returns home. Okay. Suspect or location file attached.
[4615.08s -> 4648.02s]  Oh, there's a new executive of Megacorp. Friend. Oh, we found this is him. All right. Next report.
[4648.02s -> 4665.90s]  So wait, wait. We did a smear campaign and denied. Okay. Next report. That worked. All right. Again,
[4665.90s -> 4674.12s]  do surveillance. Sign the order. All right. All right. All right. Hold on. We're getting there.
[4674.68s -> 4693.98s]  Let's take a look at the polls. We gained a point with four days. Now I've removed the
[4693.98s -> 4703.61s]  surveillance. It's all right. We got what we need. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know the guy that I have
[4703.69s -> 4716.98s]  is definitely the blue nun, right? Nothing of interest in Mary Matthews home. Two more agents
[4716.98s -> 4729.77s]  have been fired. Well, okay. Wait, hold on a minute. We are causing constant chaos and infiltrated with
[4729.77s -> 4737.98s]  our entire workforce, all the agents to try to get this guy, Dave Holtz. Dave Holtz has been
[4737.98s -> 4747.61s]  dead for like five days. So what are they doing here still? I think I need to pull them out and
[4747.61s -> 4759.99s]  put them somewhere else. Okay. Hold on. Let's leave one person. No agents. Wait, are they just
[4759.99s -> 4766.02s]  stuck there? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Can I pull them out? I think I can pull
[4766.02s -> 4772.97s]  them out. Yeah. All right. I'm going to pull them out and then we're going to go somewhere else.
[4775.59s -> 4783.78s]  Suddenly 90 plus people quit. Thank you for the opportunity. I really appreciate it. All right.
[4783.78s -> 4798.34s]  Let's go pull them out. All right. We have infiltration groups. Okay. See operation.
[4799.96s -> 4809.05s]  Okay. We next group. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Hold on. Mr. Barry Matthews. So we're all everybody
[4809.05s -> 4822.34s]  pull out from here. Zero, no agents. All right. Everybody quit. Everybody walk next door. Wait,
[4822.34s -> 4844.46s]  how come I can't pull everybody out? Do they not want to quit? Okay. Wait, give orders. No agents.
[4845.75s -> 4855.80s]  Okay. Let's wait. We have maybe we have to wait for them to quit. See operations. All right. Let's
[4855.80s -> 4874.22s]  see what happens. I just, I got to get them over to the other place. Again, the same. I just had
[4874.22s -> 4892.33s]  the palace on the phone. Don't get serious. Okay. Let's see if we can pull them out. See groups.
[4893.05s -> 4908.09s]  Core size 251. Okay. Give orders. Oh, six agents. What happened to the other group?
[4912.18s -> 4917.90s]  Why can I not? Did they make their own organization? What happened? Did they all
[4917.90s -> 4931.78s]  leave? I only have six agents. Come on. Is this one like all those people left blizzard to make
[4931.78s -> 4953.18s]  wildstar? No. Hey. All right. So we have six people left. I can't believe this. All right.
[4953.18s -> 4975.48s]  Well, we're going to send. This is our sixth best. Send them all. Infiltrate. Okay. I guess we're
[4975.48s -> 4993.06s]  going to. What happened to our 96 agents? Hold on. For security reasons, all references to the
[4993.06s -> 4998.42s]  falling will be removed from our current records. Dave Holtz, Mr. Philip Owen, George Cox, and the
[4998.42s -> 5007.34s]  National Union of Municipal Workers. So they all still are there, but now they just work there.
[5007.34s -> 5021.16s]  They just are employees there now. Well, I guess you just work there. Okay. That's still fucking
[5021.24s -> 5031.66s]  funny. Oh, we have two gaining. Hold on here. Being tailed, being discredited. Okay.
[5032.46s -> 5048.97s]  How's that smear campaign? All right. Surveillance, pursuit, search. No, no, no, no.
[5050.25s -> 5063.83s]  We can't do anything crazy here. Let's just. No, no, just stay tailored on my guess. What's
[5063.83s -> 5069.96s]  going on next here? Suspect. Okay. Right. All right. Okay. All right. Let's go.
[5071.46s -> 5084.50s]  We're gaining like a point a day. What if it's a 50-50? There's a Mr. Garcia waiting to see you.
[5085.30s -> 5133.96s]  Who's that? I was. We were winning. We were winning. We were gaining a point a day. All right.
[5133.96s -> 5147.00s]  Well, we saw that one to the end. I have a few more streamers choices, but I think we can do a
[5147.00s -> 5156.50s]  chat choice now. Let's see. Let's make sure we're in the right spot from where we were last time.
[5157.32s -> 5167.35s]  Well, this sim health. Okay. Okay. I think, yeah, this is, I think I remember doing this one,
[5167.35s -> 5175.16s]  but I think that was a streamer's choice. Okay. Are we good? I do. Oh, by the way,
[5175.16s -> 5180.04s]  I already have that one. Let's move this down. Remember, it's the ones that you can actually
[5180.04s -> 5201.19s]  see the text on. Here we go. Please click on your screen in just a second. Do it now.
[5201.59s -> 5236.36s]  Yeah. Family feud. What's the other one? God. Captain Bible or family feud. All right. Thank
[5236.36s -> 5257.88s]  you for voting. I think we got it. We're going to do captain Bible. What the fuck even is cap? What
[5257.88s -> 5277.24s]  is captain Bible? Oh man. Okay. Oh, this is like hanging my computer. Why is this hanging my
[5277.24s -> 5286.97s]  computer so hard? Come on. Let's go. Stop this. Why is it? I'm, I'm hanging. My computer is just
[5286.97s -> 5308.76s]  hanging. Fire is penetrated. Oh dear. Well, uh, has anybody seen any good books lately?
[5309.40s -> 5330.20s]  Cause I'm stuck right now. I got a wheel. Hold on. What is going on? Fucking cap Bible,
[5330.20s -> 5349.08s]  whatever the hell it is. What is going on? You're killing me. I may need to, uh,
[5350.47s -> 5368.36s]  do some control. Oh, there we go. Okay. We're good. Captain Bible. Thank God. Here we go.
[5370.17s -> 5383.51s]  What was that? There was, there was once a, there was once a city far from us in a place
[5383.51s -> 5389.75s]  and time which had been imprisoned in the dome of darkness. In vain, the Bible Corps fought to free
[5389.75s -> 5394.79s]  it from its captivity. They would have lost hope for one last desperate plan that called for the
[5394.79s -> 5409.82s]  help of their greatest champion. Why is captain Bible assaulting Hogwarts in the Star Fox land
[5409.82s -> 5425.06s]  master? What the fuck is going on? Oh, I came as quickly as I could. Is that captain Bible or am I
[5425.06s -> 5430.52s]  captain Bible? Thank you for coming captain Bible. I've asked you to come here because this city has
[5430.52s -> 5435.96s]  been taken by the enemy and we haven't been able to break his hold on him. He planted a tower of
[5435.96s -> 5441.72s]  deception inside generating a dome of darkness. That dome is actually an anti-truth field. It
[5441.72s -> 5449.24s]  makes people very prone to being deceived. Why don't we just storm the city and take it by force?
[5449.88s -> 5454.68s]  Because we've only been able to open a small hole in the dome and that hole is very unstable.
[5455.40s -> 5461.16s]  So how do I fit into this? It's funny to use that phrase because we are sending you through that
[5461.16s -> 5467.74s]  hole into the city. So what do I do when I get inside? Can I expect any resistance? What about
[5467.74s -> 5479.74s]  the people? Should I expect any problems with my computer Bible? Your computer Bible might be damaged
[5479.74s -> 5484.86s]  going through the field so we've been sending in scripture stations where you can get verses for it.
[5485.50s -> 5491.88s]  Why is he so sad? Yes, I saw them outside. How will I know where to find them? You should already have
[5491.88s -> 5501.82s]  the maps that we sent you. They show where the station should be. Okay, um, what do I do when I
[5501.82s -> 5507.82s]  get inside? Your mission will be to knock out the tower of deception which is generating the dome.
[5508.62s -> 5515.82s]  How do I do that? You will need to use the city's unibot. We'll put you as close as we can to it,
[5515.82s -> 5520.70s]  but you'll need to get help from seven other people in order to operate it. The seven deadly
[5520.70s -> 5528.52s]  sins. The seven deadly virtues, whatever the fuck they're called. All right, let's go. This music's
[5528.52s -> 5535.86s]  gonna make me crazy. Now before you go, I think we should pray. Lord, please help
[5535.86s -> 5540.34s]  Captain Bible on this mission. Please keep him safe and let your truth overcome the darkness of
[5540.34s -> 5565.91s]  deception. Amen. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Normal, easy, or different? All right, hold on. I have to
[5565.91s -> 5573.34s]  exit. This shit is fucking gonna kill my ears. All right, that's all right. That's better.
[5577.69s -> 5595.14s]  I'm not gonna do difficult. I'm gonna do, I should do easy, if anything. I can give you
[5595.14s -> 5600.57s]  trivia answers. Is it? No, I'm doing normal. I'm not doing difficult in Captain Bible.
[5601.45s -> 5615.26s]  So am I in the dome of deception? Faith. Your faith is at 100%. Okay, is this like a roguelike?
[5615.34s -> 5631.59s]  What is this? No verses loaded. Oh, this is my Bible computer. Get a verse. Verse loaded. Genesis
[5631.59s -> 5637.27s]  127. So God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him, male and female.
[5637.27s -> 5641.03s]  He created the, I don't know the rest. I have no idea. I've got to go to the Bible machine,
[5641.03s -> 5649.53s]  ATM, to find out what happens next. The trouble he causes recoils on himself. His violence comes
[5649.53s -> 5664.84s]  down on his own head. What the fuck? It doesn't matter what you say, just what you do.
[5667.96s -> 5671.88s]  So God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him,
[5671.88s -> 5673.72s]  male and female, and then created them.
[5694.58s -> 5702.95s]  I thought I instantly died. So wait, I have to use Bible verses to stop the robot murderers.
[5703.59s -> 5712.60s]  All right, let me go look at my map. Holy shit. Are you serious? Look at this. This is too big.
[5712.60s -> 5720.68s]  This is too much. Wait, hold on. There's another verse.
[5723.14s -> 5728.74s]  The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person,
[5728.74s -> 5733.22s]  sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.
[5744.58s -> 5750.18s]  The tongue is also fire, a word of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person,
[5750.18s -> 5755.62s]  sets the whole course of his life on fire, and it is itself set on fire by hell.
[5765.59s -> 5765.99s]  Is that it?
[5777.78s -> 5783.18s]  What about this one? That looks like it's going to dig into my body when I walk forward.
[5792.17s -> 5793.77s]  Cyber lie incoming.
[5808.55s -> 5823.99s]  What? How do I do true or false? So God created man.
[5823.99s -> 5837.26s]  No, this is not right. Off. It's a cyber lie. I don't have that yet.
[5845.77s -> 5850.25s]  Here comes another cyber lie. Here we go.
[5857.48s -> 5862.41s]  Where is it? Right here.
[5878.73s -> 5882.76s]  Defend. Got it.
[5894.26s -> 5903.50s]  Power. Uh oh. Again, you're a fluke of nature. No, I am. I am of God.
[5906.55s -> 5919.99s]  What is that laser? Incoming cyber lie detected. It doesn't matter what you say, just what you do.
[5923.32s -> 5928.76s]  The trouble he causes recoils on himself. His violence comes down in his own head.
[5929.40s -> 5940.89s]  The tongue is also fire. Here we go.
[5949.58s -> 5959.72s]  I'm at 49%. What happens when I run out of faith power?
[5959.72s -> 5968.28s]  Hold on. I need to see a map. Trap. Trap. Prayer chapel. I'm just going to go down, I guess.
[5973.48s -> 5987.42s]  I need more verses, don't I? Here we go. No, wait. It's this one. Right? Which one was it?
[5987.42s -> 6008.54s]  Oh, no. I couldn't do this one yet. I had to run away. What about in here? What do I need to go?
[6008.54s -> 6013.64s]  So I can't go down. Go up and to the right or to the left and then down.
[6013.64s -> 6019.46s]  Let's try over here. Here we go. New verse.
[6021.40s -> 6024.60s]  That he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures,
[6024.60s -> 6029.32s]  and that he appeared to Peter and then to the twelve after that. He appeared to more than five
[6029.32s -> 6033.56s]  hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen
[6033.56s -> 6042.92s]  asleep. I need to match to unlock. It is most important to totally love God and to truly love
[6042.92s -> 6067.32s]  people also. The tongue is also fire. I don't think it's any of these. I have to go down from here.
[6068.41s -> 6073.02s]  Yeah. Oh, we got another one.
[6079.83s -> 6080.31s]  Sounds good.
[6090.14s -> 6094.94s]  All right. This is like using the world card in Binding of Isaac.
[6095.50s -> 6100.49s]  Restore my faith. Give me the sword of the spirit. Give me the shield of faith.
[6100.49s -> 6103.85s]  Warn me of traps and snares. Light my path before me.
[6109.94s -> 6121.66s]  Light my path before before me. How much faith do I have? I don't know. Thank you, Lord. I believe.
[6122.54s -> 6129.22s]  Lord, please give me the sword of this. Light my path before me. Where in the Bible does it
[6129.22s -> 6144.94s]  talk about God lighting my path? I don't know. Lord, please give me that cool sword.
[6145.66s -> 6154.52s]  What does it talk about? The sword of the spirit. Hey, Lord, I could use some more things.
[6158.12s -> 6169.62s]  Lord, please. Where in the Bible does it talk about avoiding traps? Right here. Right? Avoid like the...
[6170.26s -> 6187.72s]  Here we go. Did it work? I'm not very good at this. Okay, I got full health. What's in here?
[6187.72s -> 6194.14s]  All right. Here we go. An easy one. When Jesus died, he stayed dead. After all,
[6194.14s -> 6209.98s]  nobody saw him after the crucifixion. Got you. All right. So now what do I got?
[6209.98s -> 6229.85s]  I might be able to go up now. What was this one? The rainbow is just light refracting through water,
[6229.85s -> 6241.58s]  not a creation of God with a divine purpose. Uh-oh. That's a cyber lie.
[6242.22s -> 6266.06s]  Are we sure this is not just like a scientist with a helmet on? Uh, this Genesis? No, none of these
[6266.06s -> 6288.23s]  work. Scientists are liars. All right, what about this one? Match. No, no, I don't have this one yet.
[6288.79s -> 6297.85s]  Do I have this one? I have to be able to go one of these ways. Let's confront the cyber lie.
[6298.41s -> 6304.81s]  Here we go. Children are born pure and innocent. If you let them do whatever they want, they will
[6304.81s -> 6334.41s]  grow up with great wisdom. This one. Oh, oh, that didn't work. Uh, what is it? My son,
[6334.41s -> 6346.14s]  if citizen types do not give in to them. Dude, there are people dressed like this in Stormwind,
[6346.14s -> 6363.18s]  okay? A bit like the hammer. They can just walk by him? But this is, that wasn't a very good trap.
[6363.74s -> 6367.66s]  But this is what the high and lofty one says. He who lives forever, whose name is holy,
[6367.66s -> 6372.94s]  live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit to revive
[6372.94s -> 6384.09s]  the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the okay. Here we go. Doesn't matter what you
[6384.09s -> 6404.70s]  say, just what you do. It was palms, right? No, it was a tongue is also fire. Nice. All right,
[6404.70s -> 6413.30s]  what does it look like about left me go up? All right, let's confront the cyber lie here.
[6414.18s -> 6429.14s]  Do unto others before they do unto you and you'll get away with it. What? That's, that's palms. Do
[6429.14s -> 6443.93s]  unto others before they do unto you and you'll get away with it. That's a pretty sick shield.
[6443.93s -> 6454.54s]  Look at that. Look at the back. That's a nice shield. Yeah, he's going to kill me.
[6465.75s -> 6483.13s]  He'd make that stuff. That's not good. 38% faith. Come on, give me a, uh, give me a heal room. Cast
[6483.13s -> 6490.66s]  all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. Right. All right. Unlock match to unlock.
[6492.34s -> 6514.76s]  It takes discipline to get the foolishness out of a kid. What? What the fuck? I don't,
[6514.76s -> 6530.92s]  I don't know if we have this one. Seek God and he will answer you. Peter, cast all your anxiety
[6530.92s -> 6541.35s]  on him because he cares for you. Or I live in a high and low, but I was also was trying to lowly
[6541.35s -> 6562.76s]  spare this one. Is it Peter? Didn't open. Didn't open. Did I lose faith to that? No. Another cyber
[6562.76s -> 6577.48s]  lie. If a gang tells you to do it, then you just gotta do it. What, what, what is even the context
[6577.56s -> 6597.32s]  here? Proverbs? No, this thing's going to kill me. Thank God for, I mean, like honestly, thank God.
[6597.32s -> 6611.50s]  Right. I said that a lot, but for real. Oh, when do you just die? He stayed dead after. No, no, no,
[6611.50s -> 6627.94s]  it's, uh, here it is. All right. I haven't bought one of these yet. Folly is bound up in the heart
[6627.94s -> 6650.28s]  of a child with the broad. Okay. Okay. What the fuck? It's not, that's not fucking no. The sword,
[6650.28s -> 6657.32s]  I can get the sword though. Yeah. I don't think you guys realize how much like fucking
[6658.28s -> 6686.10s]  Monka S shit is inside of the Bible. We do realize. Lord, please give me the sword of the spirit.
[6686.10s -> 6693.69s]  Where in the Bible does it talk about the sword of the spirit? The sword of the spirit.
[6693.69s -> 6705.08s]  Here it is. That was a very holy, uh, legend of Zelda melody thing. The one that, whatever,
[6705.08s -> 6720.36s]  forget it. It's not important. All right. I'm going to go up so I can unlock this door now.
[6724.22s -> 6727.74s]  Can I use this or do I just have it? Oh, you hit harder in battle.
[6729.50s -> 6734.06s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Foolishness. Uh, no child should be foolish.
[6734.78s -> 6755.10s]  Wait, what the fuck is it? It's proverbs. All right. Open the damn door. What has, what is going on?
[6759.45s -> 6770.15s]  Okay. Whose picture is that? The new lamb of God. What? He's Jesus incarnated.
[6770.55s -> 6787.96s]  Oh, what the fuck is going on? He is not. Uh, he's not. He is too. He is not. He is too. He is not.
[6787.96s -> 6792.28s]  Go away. Okay. But I'll be back. We're going to bring my dad and he's going to tell you that
[6792.92s -> 6814.33s]  that's not Jesus. Uh, no, hold on. I'm back. Would you like to talk to me? No, you must be from
[6814.33s -> 6824.02s]  Babylon. You are not a true believer. Whose picture is that? What? The Bible shows that there
[6824.02s -> 6835.66s]  is no reincarnation. Oh, that's how we, we do the, that's how we, uh, I don't get it. I, I don't get
[6835.66s -> 6851.82s]  it. Go away. Okay. But I'll be back. I don't get it. All right. So we're going to go, uh, down.

[6861.99s -> 6874.14s]  stop, stop, stop. What the fuck? Some Christians have changed their minds and become atheists. That
[6874.14s -> 6894.71s]  proves that the Bible is full of lies. The tongue is also fire. The sword of the spirit. What?
[6895.35s -> 6908.74s]  I don't think I have this one. Can I go up to the right? All right. Go through
[6908.74s -> 6918.86s]  and just, I might have, stop! Why does that have to happen? There we go. Okay. They will,

[7548.70s -> 7562.94s]  do nothing okay i don't think that helps us i could probably maybe i should go down um i can't i
[7562.94s -> 7574.70s]  don't think i can go over there maybe down here let me try to heal first maybe i don't think i can
[7575.50s -> 7587.88s]  i think i'm assuming you can only use one prayer room once lord please oh shit we're good we're
[7587.88s -> 7601.10s]  good all right so there's this person down here that we have to convince you can't come back to

[7623.61s -> 7640.23s]  go see if i can do anything so i have to go up right down no down down down down all right
[7640.23s -> 7645.67s]  what about down here no i've already done these what about the one next across from the from the
[7645.67s -> 7674.14s]  v wait here we go yeah yeah yeah yeah these things are hard all right we're gonna go left and then
[7674.22s -> 7701.99s]  up and then right seek god and he will answer you um i don't know if we have this i'm the vine hold on
[7704.87s -> 7714.44s]  no this is this one man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth
[7714.44s -> 7736.54s]  of god i don't think that's that clear though he will let's try this one nope you don't lose
[7736.54s -> 7746.65s]  anything for this though just try john am i losing faith no i'm just guessing at the door
[7747.21s -> 7758.41s]  guessing the password i don't have this all right do i have the thing that's necessary to
[7759.80s -> 7777.90s]  okay what that's reincarnated there's no such thing as reincarnation and i'll prove it uh he was
[7777.90s -> 7788.28s]  buried that he was raised on the third day no this is proving reincarnation this is me proving that
[7788.28s -> 7802.73s]  you can reincarnate so i'm about to get like this thrown back in my face i don't get it go away
[7803.37s -> 7818.01s]  that's not it jesus resurrected not reincarnated right right that's yeah that's true okay you're
[7818.01s -> 7833.10s]  right you got me there uh what have i not tried down to the right it looks like a whole hallway
[7833.10s -> 7844.25s]  here that i didn't do up i think there's a monster here no okay this is the prayer area
[7845.96s -> 7857.14s]  remember that one all right did i get this one no one cares uh yes they do he does
[7858.26s -> 7879.03s]  it's a really strange version of uh samus here we go he who hates me hates my father as well
[7879.75s -> 7892.34s]  okay we're loading up on verses here do i take any pleasure in the death of the wicked declares the
[7892.34s -> 7907.96s]  sovereign lord rather am i not pleased when they turn from their ways and live uh all right so what
[7907.96s -> 7926.07s]  is that gonna open if you don't love jesus you don't love god right no no wait i think we have
[7926.07s -> 7940.09s]  this one yeah if you like hate me then you hate yeah where is it who you hate me hates my father
[7940.09s -> 7962.17s]  as well got it um what's happening here why am i playing like the 3d sonic globe game oh shit
[7962.17s -> 7973.86s]  god wants to kill the sinners before they get a chance for uh to repent no no no no where is it
[7973.86s -> 7994.23s]  we just got it we just got it what the hell is it called the one where it's like i don't want to
[7994.31s -> 8015.02s]  i want you to turn away from ezekiel here it is there we go here we go persevere all right
[8015.02s -> 8019.58s]  jesus replied love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all
[8019.58s -> 8025.02s]  your mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it love your neighbor as
[8025.02s -> 8034.47s]  yourself all right keep me from the snares they have laid for me from the trap set by the evil
[8034.47s -> 8040.63s]  doers okay now i can see all traps in snares so what is in this door it looks like a boss door
[8040.63s -> 8059.91s]  save it all right uh warn me of uh traps and snares what was it called i don't i just got it
[8059.91s -> 8077.08s]  i don't remember what the hell it was there we go so now what does that mean do i have light my path
[8078.31s -> 8091.88s]  as well as restore faith okay i don't think i have light my path before me yet no i don't have it
[8097.82s -> 8108.47s]  that's it there's one more area i still don't have a thing about reincarnation do i have to
[8108.47s -> 8126.52s]  run back of course i do not bad this is not considered a trap all right up left and up
[8127.24s -> 8166.52s]  see if we can get in there seek god and he will answer you i don't know if we have this no love
[8166.52s -> 8181.05s]  the lord apart from me no none of this is about he who hates me hates no no no we can't get in here
[8183.38s -> 8191.26s]  shit so i the only way the place i can go is up here there has to be something i can do up there
[8191.26s -> 8200.89s]  because i can't do anything else over here why is it blinking oh all the way up go go go go those
[8200.89s -> 8214.63s]  are trap doors oh okay it just blinks if it's trap door all right let me get in here i got it is
[8214.63s -> 8226.49s]  most important to totally love god and to truly love people right i have this with what i would
[8230.73s -> 8242.94s]  there it is right that's it get in oh god none of these this is like hurts my head
[8243.82s -> 8257.69s]  i really don't want it this is another one of those like jump warps it is for freedom that
[8257.69s -> 8262.01s]  christ has set us free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of
[8262.01s -> 8277.66s]  slavery okay i'm almost at the end of the game guys it's almost done the greatest christian
[8277.66s -> 8295.50s]  commandment is that you go to church no it is not it is the what is it where is it that's like the
[8295.50s -> 8314.82s]  the greatest commandment what was it yes is it let him do anything don't let him attack
[8320.87s -> 8326.63s]  uh all right but even if we are an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one
[8326.63s -> 8332.71s]  we preach to you let him be eternally condemned what does that do for me though oh shit this is
[8332.71s -> 8344.94s]  a spider what did you come from jesus told one truth other teachers have of other truths you
[8344.94s -> 8351.88s]  should believe them just as much as jesus we just got it there it is all right we have never fought
[8351.88s -> 8378.44s]  the spider before though i don't know i don't know what to do here did he give up what i was
[8378.44s -> 8385.05s]  kind i like i cut like all of his legs off you couldn't have just like liquefied him or something
[8388.06s -> 8396.25s]  all right well that's trapped through there you don't need the bible as long as you have something
[8396.25s -> 8404.58s]  to eat uh no there's one specifically about bread in here where is it you can like eat you can live
[8404.58s -> 8420.73s]  off of bread alone right there it is i can't believe i'm gonna beat this game that's i don't
[8420.73s -> 8426.63s]  know why but for some reason this is like unbelievable to me oh shit we gotta save it
[8426.63s -> 8440.31s]  right here this is the hard one uh i have to do this here we go holy god would never associate
[8440.31s -> 8446.55s]  with an insignificant speck of protoplasm like you no it's like though we're god is us and we
[8446.55s -> 8468.71s]  are god right which one is it um no no no no no it's um which one is this is it um here it is
[8469.35s -> 8472.55s]  i am the vine you are the branches of a man remains in me and i and him he will bear much
[8472.55s -> 8490.78s]  fruit apart from me you can do nothing here we go right john 15 five that's not it he who lives
[8490.78s -> 8495.02s]  forever whose name is holy i live in a high and holy place but also with him is oh yeah it's this
[8495.02s -> 8510.38s]  one all right i just this guy hits hard so why was that guy so much easier than the last one
[8512.39s -> 8523.40s]  like i mean we're talking 10 times easier than the last one all who sin apart from the law will
[8523.40s -> 8527.32s]  also perish apart from the law and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law
[8528.36s -> 8536.47s]  okay so you're judged by the law don't like break the law law all right let's go again
[8536.47s -> 8545.42s]  no law when jesus daddy stayed dead after nobody saw him after the okay this is the one we're here
[8545.42s -> 8554.71s]  it's genesis right no no no which uh which one is it right here which one is it right right right
[8554.71s -> 8559.22s]  where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it which one is
[8559.22s -> 8572.65s]  it where is it where is it where is it which one is it where is it there it is and oh he's to open
[8572.65s -> 8586.65s]  his eye okay that's how i how did i shoot him that many times and not hit his eye i don't know how
[8586.65s -> 8592.49s]  all right that's a that's a trap over there let's do this among this is probably like a uh holy room
[8592.49s -> 8600.09s]  yes all right i'm not going to use this heal because i probably need it do i have the light yet
[8600.73s -> 8615.56s]  this is a big circle i almost probably i think i almost have them people can't be expected to
[8615.56s -> 8640.41s]  live by god's laws uh la la la la la we just got it which one is it galactus i'm getting pretty
[8640.41s -> 8647.75s]  good at this just as a man is destined to die once and after that to face judgment die once
[8648.95s -> 8663.69s]  no reincarnation we can bring it back i have almost explored everything you don't have to
[8663.77s -> 8679.99s]  accept jesus in order to love god um i don't know you don't have to accept yeah where's the
[8679.99s -> 8690.97s]  one that like you you have to be the branch the branch right he who hates me hates my father
[8692.20s -> 8705.37s]  all right this is every i think i got them all johnson grew powerful because he walked
[8705.37s -> 8712.50s]  steadfastly before the lord is god the before the john grew powerful because he walked steadfastly
[8712.50s -> 8725.78s]  before the lord is god lord like the path lord the random spider real power is obtained through
[8725.78s -> 8765.24s]  intimidation and manipulation law i don't know which one that is seek you uh is it this one
[8766.36s -> 8781.14s]  it is that one that's funny it's just funny all right now let's go light our path go prove that
[8781.14s -> 8802.52s]  reincarnation doesn't exist that's not it that's not it which one is it i think i have them all
[8809.75s -> 8829.77s]  lighting a path i think i have every single one well i'm just gonna heal all right let's
[8830.65s -> 8844.36s]  go oh there's two up here all right let's go back this is the no that's a that's not that's a

[8913.78s -> 8919.86s]  destined to die once and after that to face judgment if people can only die once then that
[8919.86s -> 8926.76s]  means that they can't come back as babies and die over again well maybe but he's still the new lamb
[8926.76s -> 8931.96s]  of god he is the holy one who has the new holy revelation that was never mentioned in the bible
[8931.96s -> 8938.95s]  that proves that he's true well the bible talks about people who preach a different gospel
[8938.95s -> 8952.57s]  it's the angel one or is it but even if okay how can he be holy when the bible calls him accursed
[8953.13s -> 8962.10s]  do the eyes just move the eye with the eyes looking at her last time he's always been so
[8962.10s -> 8967.21s]  good to me and guided me into the new truth and accepted me into his family just because he seems
[8967.21s -> 8978.94s]  nice that doesn't mean that he doesn't have an ulterior motive listen to this verse uh listen to
[8978.94s -> 8986.26s]  this one just because he seems nice that doesn't mean that he doesn't have an ulterior motive
[8986.90s -> 8992.39s]  where is it where is it it's the one that's like one of the first ones

[17098.07s -> 17104.15s]  up an object as the green shield drop an object such as the green shell so you can stand on it
[17105.13s -> 17111.21s]  insert as fire fireball only when there is a fire flower enter shoot a red shell only when
[17111.21s -> 17121.32s]  there is a red or purple shell in mario's inventory mario speaks uh okay i think i
[17121.32s -> 17131.38s]  understand read the story the mushroom kingdom is in great mourn ever since the governor of the
[17131.38s -> 17137.78s]  mushroom kingdom had received an urgent stress call from princess toadstool his daughter of
[17138.42s -> 17149.14s]  princess toadstool accompanied by luigi for her safety were making trips across the land
[17149.14s -> 17156.90s]  looking for mystery super mushrooms the call was made from the royal family's submarine somewhere
[17156.90s -> 17161.86s]  near the northern hemisphere of the planet called the yoshi's world the message was simple the
[17161.86s -> 17167.46s]  princess and luigi were trapped on the shore of lake hamhurst where their submarine had been
[17167.54s -> 17173.54s]  wrecked by a violent storm at sea this is where mario's role comes to play mario must make his
[17173.54s -> 17184.36s]  way to lake hamhurst to all right enough to rescue the princess in luigi why does mario have to do
[17184.36s -> 17191.27s]  the job you ask well when bowser heard word about the princess and luigi being stranded on the
[17191.99s -> 17199.11s]  shore of lake hamhurst he sent his goons out to stop any i can still hear it stop any rescue
[17199.11s -> 17204.71s]  ships from coming to the rescue it seems bowser is up to his no good the only one who is capable
[17204.71s -> 17210.95s]  of beating bowser's good goons and rescuing the princess and luigi by the way luigi forgot his
[17210.95s -> 17217.51s]  firefowl hour at home leaving him powerless against bowser's goons is mario this this is
[17217.51s -> 17223.93s]  still going this situation would not be as bad as it by the way trying to read this
[17224.90s -> 17231.69s]  like purple the purple text with no outline on this background is i have to like cross my eyes
[17232.25s -> 17237.45s]  the situation would not be as bad as if it would be however mario was just recently taking a
[17237.45s -> 17244.33s]  vacation from just had rescued the princess from bowser a month earlier is not in the area yoshi's
[17244.33s -> 17250.41s]  world as such mario must travel from the planet he is now on to yoshi's world four planets way
[17250.41s -> 17255.93s]  however he must stop this is predictive text i feel like i'm i wrote this on an iphone line by
[17255.93s -> 17262.25s]  line he must stop on each planet to pick up the key which only then can he continue his journey
[17262.25s -> 17267.37s]  on the next planet bowser is also making his way through therefore mario must battle against
[17267.37s -> 17273.69s]  bowser's goons time is against mario as he must make it to the submarine wreck princess and luigi
[17273.69s -> 17299.19s]  before bowser does will mario become the hero once again okay let me welcome to my shore
[17299.91s -> 17308.54s]  for

[17700.89s -> 17709.53s]  and a runny nose so i just like poked his stomach okay uh admitted of abdominal pain

[17722.86s -> 17734.33s]  an ultra scan uh referral somebody else to do this no let's do an x-ray let's find out let's get an
[17734.33s -> 17739.67s]  x-ray of your stomach and see if we can see anything is that the stuff that's not the stomach all
[17739.67s -> 17758.09s]  right is there anything here i didn't see anything observed you diagnosed this and recommended
[17758.09s -> 17762.33s]  treatment were incorrect and you have been taken off the case report to medical school on the
[17762.33s -> 17772.84s]  double dr wilson called from the lounge on line four medical school is the first door on your
[17772.84s -> 17781.67s]  right better go now all right when the nurse tells you that you have received a phone call it is
[17781.67s -> 17787.43s]  considered poor protocol not to return the call you may use the phone on the front desk your beeper
[17787.43s -> 17792.39s]  should tell you the correct extension to call in your last case your physical examination of
[17792.39s -> 17798.15s]  the abdomen was incomplete you must be sure to palpate all four quadrants of the abdomen
[17798.15s -> 17802.55s]  including the sides of the lower abdomen and the navel area for the exam to be effective so i did
[17802.55s -> 17808.98s]  an exam in your last case you ordered an unnecessary x-ray the patient's symptoms did not indicate a
[17808.98s -> 17814.18s]  need for an x-ray padding the hospital bill in this manner is frowned upon at tool works general
[17814.18s -> 17822.17s]  this concludes class for now thank you for attending okay dr wilson on number four okay call
[17824.62s -> 17843.64s]  call for the line four how do i use the phone like 004 number four it really is
[17843.64s -> 17852.50s]  triple zero four this is dr wilson thanks for calling back keep sharp today that's all is it
[17852.50s -> 17859.18s]  you have a patient in room four last door on your right here we go are you sure what are you talking
[17859.18s -> 17867.98s]  about should go she left last door on the right patient is 24-year-old male patient was admitted
[17867.98s -> 17872.78s]  complaining of acute abdominal pain accompanied by nausea cramping and generalized weakness okay
[17873.66s -> 17883.14s]  all right let me take a look that feels all right no problems here no pain there that doesn't hurt
[17883.78s -> 17891.94s]  right there right here all right it's on the left side all right i think that's that's the kidney
[17891.94s -> 17900.28s]  right no is that the gallbladder okay so right here that's like a side flank pain that's uh what
[17900.36s -> 17911.26s]  is that okay so you're not no only down here in the lower lower left side of your stomach
[17911.26s -> 17919.54s]  i'm thinking we should uh lower left of the stomach flu-like symptoms maybe medication
[17920.94s -> 17933.61s]  or maybe do an ultrasound or refer to a gastroenterologist maybe some pain relief
[17933.61s -> 17948.47s]  and then a referral no i would just i would be it would be referral what you recommend a course of
[17948.47s -> 17957.69s]  action was correct but you did not follow the correct procedure that was right in your last
[17957.69s -> 17961.69s]  case your examination the abdomen revealed that the patient was experiencing pain on both sides of
[17961.69s -> 17967.35s]  the lower abdomen even though the appendix is on the right side some appendicitis patients will
[17967.35s -> 17974.07s]  experience pain on both sides during examination an x-ray is required how the fuck was i supposed
[17974.07s -> 17984.71s]  to know last door on the left they're all they'll have abdominal pain hey i got an idea why don't
[17984.71s -> 17991.56s]  we check the water that's the third person with the same acute abdominal pain in the last 10
[17991.56s -> 18026.31s]  minutes flu-like symptoms okay let's take a look no pain okay we've got no pain no pain at all
[18026.31s -> 18047.30s]  all right so no pain to touch which means you've got the flu medicaid your last case the examination
[18047.30s -> 18050.74s]  of the patient revealed that the patient was not suffering from acute abdominal pain further
[18050.74s -> 18055.78s]  observation of the patient is indicated as the usual cause of uh transient abdominal pain as an
[18055.94s -> 18072.49s]  intestinal gas abdominal pain okay patient suffering from abdominal pain accompanied by
[18072.49s -> 18080.62s]  flu-like symptoms nausea generalized weakness and dizziness all right we got acute pain
[18084.63s -> 18095.35s]  on both sides anywhere else left and right we're gonna do an x-ray left and right right
[18095.35s -> 18112.30s]  okay i'm just gonna confirm okay we're good x-ray what does that show nothing i think we're good

[24505.53s -> 24513.30s]  emote ever and it's like if i was intentionally trying to have an emote that was awful i love it
[24513.30s -> 24521.22s]  though that's my favorite emote this is by far my favorite emote on the site and i didn't do it for
[24521.22s -> 24528.74s]  five months i don't think anybody has one that can compare i don't think they do i'll stand
[24528.74s -> 24533.62s]  on the eagle maniac hill here that's why i love that emote that's the best emote on twitch god
[24533.62s -> 24543.46s]  what a beautiful emote i agree it's so good i say that because it's my faith to me i hope you guys
[24543.46s -> 24547.78s]  don't take me that seriously definitely take me that seriously i'm not kidding that is the best
[24548.26s -> 24567.56s]  twitch but thank you lazy luke uh thank you chimera 87x for the 250 rick vitality is alex jones's
[24567.56s -> 24589.61s]  next supplement line rick vitality that guy was wild thank you to stiff funky chicken for the
[24589.61s -> 24596.71s]  three bucks uh i asked last night you this but i think you missed it if not disregard i was
[24596.71s -> 24600.55s]  wondering if you had thought about establishing a place for members to submit community art
[24602.23s -> 24609.35s]  yeah uh i'm not sure how much you've been around the last week or so but i'm going to start to do
[24609.35s -> 24614.95s]  community nights where instead of it just being we're gonna do artwork we're gonna do show a
[24614.95s -> 24622.39s]  couple of a video that somebody sent through we're gonna do uh hey somebody sent like a funny copy
[24622.39s -> 24629.37s]  pasta once every two or three weeks we're gonna just compile all of them and spend an hour or two
[24629.37s -> 24636.81s]  at least going through so it'll be like artwork videos random like little stories that people
[24636.81s -> 24645.43s]  write so and that's why i've not been uh i've been i don't really have a time frame for that
[24646.31s -> 24652.79s]  unfortunately because this carnival stream has taken up all of my other non-on stream time
[24654.78s -> 24660.30s]  when i'm not live on twitch besides like taking a day or two here just to kind of you know
[24661.26s -> 24667.96s]  to hang out with my girlfriend and you'd be like a person i've been doing this carnival shit
[24668.92s -> 24673.80s]  so i haven't put that much brain power into this yet and it really is probably not going to start
[24673.80s -> 24685.14s]  happening until the carnival stream is over so all time that is dedicated to like stream stuff
[24685.14s -> 24695.61s]  is split at this point evenly with the carnival and being like actually on stream but after the
[24695.77s -> 24702.44s]  21st i'm really gonna get that hammered out and have an actual set time for whenever we're gonna
[24702.44s -> 24707.66s]  do it i might even be able to do it it depends on how much work gets done uh this coming week
[24710.57s -> 24715.05s]  next week is when most of the real important details for this frame are gonna happen
[24715.05s -> 24721.05s]  because it's already been back and forth about contracts and what do we want how many robots
[24721.05s -> 24724.01s]  do you want how many things do you want to do do you want to have this do you want to have that
[24724.01s -> 24728.97s]  and this next week here is we're all going to be in the same room and really hash the whole thing
[24728.97s -> 24738.94s]  out so might be able to do it sooner than that we'll see but it is coming it will be here
[24740.38s -> 24753.85s]  hey real sleazy thanks for the five dollars get serious to start flying lessons hey hash house
[24753.85s -> 24761.14s]  ago go the whole thing oh don't say that that makes me want to have the blue cheese stuffed

[24805.80s -> 24811.59s]  as someone who lives in vegas i can vouch for this thank you
[24812.39s -> 24821.11s]  that place is 24 hours and has some of the best just delicious food you can get all night every
[24821.11s -> 24832.34s]  day god i fucking love that place i really do did they deliver across the country i don't think so

[24907.70s -> 24913.38s]  burger place because every single time we have ever gone to try to get one there's a line out
[24913.38s -> 24924.90s]  of the door you need to be ready to wait in a in a pax line to go see the 12 minutes of legend of
[24924.90s -> 24944.73s]  zelda 6 but you know i'm saying for like three hours it is an actual disney world line book a
[24944.73s -> 24952.58s]  seat in advance i'm not sure they do that a lot of restaurants in vegas don't like do reservations
[24953.56s -> 24961.94s]  you just kind of have to show the fuck up we went somewhere uh last week or yeah we went somewhere
[24961.94s -> 24976.10s]  that you you can't you physically can't they don't do reservations how much have you gambled since
[24976.10s -> 24994.07s]  you moved to vegas let me one to two hundred thousand dollars not a whole lot oh but i forgot
[24994.07s -> 25000.79s]  to mention uh i put one dollar in a machine when we first got here and hit a million dollars so
[25000.79s -> 25005.19s]  i mean that's not that much in the grand you know picture i still got 800 000

[25011.13s -> 25018.63s]  is that for that is not for real no that did not fucking happen i would be on the goddamn
[25018.63s -> 25032.36s]  news if that happened if i put a dollar into a machine and it won a million i would be holding
[25032.36s -> 25053.99s]  the check smiling like hey did it i'd be on all the fucking news stations uh unfortunately
[25054.71s -> 25063.22s]  i did not win a jackpot i wouldn't be able to hold that information in if you would hit a fucking
[25063.22s -> 25069.46s]  million dollars on like a scratch ticket or a slot machine or some weird table game you think i'd be
[25069.46s -> 25075.53s]  able to keep my mouth shut every day would just be like million million a million you know you want

[25298.95s -> 25308.76s]  diego um yeah i i think maybe i don't know it's going to be really tough i have not decided if
[25308.76s -> 25314.76s]  i'm going to actually be at twitchcon or not and is for one very specific reason because
[25316.34s -> 25323.93s]  that carnival stream is on the 21st and i don't know how i might because i'm not going to be able
[25323.93s -> 25330.78s]  to stream i'm not going to be able to stream for almost a week before that stream happens
[25331.66s -> 25338.70s]  i will be in this facility getting everything set up and moving stuff and helping
[25339.26s -> 25344.22s]  set up sets and talking to people and telling people where i want things and i mean i'm going
[25344.22s -> 25351.26s]  to be there for probably like five days before 21st of september so i won't be live for a while
[25351.26s -> 25358.39s]  and then come back oh hey it's like the 23rd 24th and then what just stream like for a day or two
[25358.39s -> 25364.92s]  and then leave again for like four or five days you know what i'm saying i would only be live for
[25364.92s -> 25375.50s]  like two days out of like two and a half weeks and i don't know if i want to do that the idea is that
[25375.50s -> 25382.86s]  i would probably go for it a short duration because i really will only have like a day or two to kind
[25382.86s -> 25389.72s]  of get back to normal and then i'm leaving again to go to twitchcon so we'll see i may or may not
[25389.72s -> 25397.37s]  be there for like a day or two i've not 100 decided yet i do have a ticket though because
[25397.37s -> 25403.05s]  i made sure to get one to i have a twitchcon ticket so it's not like i'm going to be like
[25403.05s -> 25425.85s]  locked out or anything but uh maybe we'll see there'll be a clown car at this carnival stream
[25426.49s -> 25447.46s]  how would i not have clowns at a carnival you want to help advertise the carnival stream you
[25447.46s -> 25456.04s]  should put something about it on your offline screen yeah as we get closer there's going to
[25456.04s -> 25462.25s]  be a lot more i'll be talking about it a lot more and potentially even uh the companies that are
[25462.25s -> 25471.85s]  involved because i know that i'm gonna be you'll know who's behind a lot of this it's not just
[25471.85s -> 25480.22s]  gonna be the this nameless faceless company you'll know who's helped out a lot so we'll go i don't
[25480.22s -> 25488.54s]  have that information yet so but uh thank you for the 10 bucks bet three i'm not sure yet
[25489.50s -> 25494.46s]  creamy sensation thanks for the five dollars this is doom but a doom slayer went to heaven instead
[25494.46s -> 25507.27s]  of hell that was for the bible game i forgot about that game it's been a weird night huh
[25509.85s -> 25514.65s]  thank you to fuss roe for the five dollars germa i'm playing dark souls for the first time
[25514.65s -> 25522.10s]  what's the best build do you have any tips i'm i'm i'm sorry i might be the worst person to ask
[25522.90s -> 25539.32s]  the best weapon in dark souls remastered um doesn't isn't dark souls one have like a lot
[25539.32s -> 25556.47s]  of usable weapons you can pretty much use anything have you tried playing a good game instead
[25556.47s -> 25566.22s]  whoa hold on whoops they have uh hit the brakes on that one for a second playing a good i mean
[25566.22s -> 25573.10s]  yeah the first 12 out 15 hours of dark souls one is is incredible and then in the middle
[25573.10s -> 25580.94s]  like 10 hours is puke inducing and and awful and but then the last like 20 of the hours are
[25580.94s -> 25592.41s]  absolutely fantastic so a majority of that game is incredible so you can forget about the the middle
[25592.41s -> 25596.33s]  part this is just it's the fucking lettuce you can you can take the lettuce out if you want
[25596.33s -> 25615.40s]  just eat the burger dark souls is a 60 hour game yeah i mean all the souls born games your first
[25615.40s -> 25621.13s]  playthrough always takes like 30 to 50 hours because you have no idea what the hell you're
[25621.13s -> 25636.39s]  doing or where you're going the dark souls one is still a great game though it's still a really
[25636.39s -> 25652.09s]  really good game lettuce is unimportant on anything lettuce is kind of just crunchy water
[25656.82s -> 25664.17s]  but sometimes crunchy water is really important on some stuff uh thank you bananaism for the five
[25664.17s -> 25670.41s]  dollars and 90 cents they say chug chug chug i'm not sure what i was chugging at the time
[25670.41s -> 25683.10s]  well what you wanted me to chug but i didn't uh thank you to doctor uh dr enak for the 20
[25683.10s -> 25691.54s]  dollars 10 dollars twice in a row say i love ms dos nights i do too sometimes i get really really
[25691.54s -> 25698.17s]  overstimulated when we do this though because so many different colors and loud sounds and music
[25698.17s -> 25705.13s]  and weird fucked up shit and after like four to five hours six hours of doing dos i kind of just
[25705.13s -> 25714.18s]  like my brain turns to mush but i do love doing it it's so much fun just to see although it's
[25714.18s -> 25723.38s]  like you never know what you're gonna get it's a it's a box of chocolates and some of the chocolates
[25723.38s -> 25734.62s]  are filled with acid but thank you for the 20 bucks i really appreciate it uh flank tank
[25734.62s -> 25738.38s]  thanks for three bucks how much money would it take for you to scream on mixer full time
[25739.58s -> 25756.26s]  i've a look listen let me tell you something this is very very easy answer i i made the switch to
[25756.82s -> 25764.82s]  a different platform before right i went from youtube to twitch and i think it's probably taken
[25766.39s -> 25772.63s]  a couple years to really have everybody understand that i'm here i i made a switch
[25773.69s -> 25777.61s]  so going switching from youtube to twitch and then from twitch to another platform
[25778.65s -> 25784.01s]  i feel like that's like that's like the second platform switch i don't know if i have it in me
[25784.01s -> 25791.59s]  to do like another platform switch again now i mean i don't know if twitch for some reason
[25792.15s -> 25797.75s]  starts to really become like a company or as a company that i don't really want to be a part
[25797.75s -> 25801.59s]  of and i'd rather try something else i mean that that'll that conversation will happen with myself
[25802.95s -> 25818.14s]  what i do for millions of dollars i mean that's like that but that's like saying yes i probably
[25818.14s -> 25823.80s]  would because that's that's like you want to be like no i wouldn't do that how dare they even
[25823.80s -> 25827.88s]  have decided you know what i could do with a million dollars you know what i could do with
[25827.88s -> 25845.80s]  two fucking million dollars i i would make a goddamn movie i would i would do it would be all
[25845.80s -> 25858.46s]  kinds of crazy shit that i would do on those streams but no i mean i'd be lying to you guys if
[25858.46s -> 25862.78s]  i and i and i think a majority of people would probably be lying to you if it was like hey would
[25862.78s -> 25869.42s]  you like switch over for like a million dollars no no i don't think so i don't believe so i would
[25869.42s -> 25877.35s]  probably continue to stay here i don't know i yes that's like literally life-changing fucking never
[25877.35s -> 25883.51s]  have to work again a day in your life money yeah obviously like you're gonna do it if it's just if
[25883.51s -> 25892.31s]  yeah well maybe not everybody would do it for various reasons but two or three million dollars
[25892.31s -> 25908.97s]  is like that you that's every cent you'd ever need until until you were buried i'd burn through
[25908.97s -> 25920.28s]  that money quick no i wouldn't i would not i would do the thing where i would hide okay for if i got
[25920.28s -> 25925.08s]  if i came into like a million couple million dollars like tomorrow right the first thing i
[25925.08s -> 25931.48s]  would do i would hire a lawyer i would get a really really good lawyer and i would say i want you to
[25931.48s -> 25937.40s]  make a contract that i have to sign to dump my money into like a vault that i cannot open
[25938.36s -> 25943.72s]  you know what i'm saying like i want you to i want to put a million dollars into a vault
[25943.72s -> 25948.36s]  that i'm not allowed to touch like retirement account type shit just put it into a big safe
[25948.36s -> 25952.42s]  and don't give me the combination but you don't get to have it though like he's like okay i'll
[25952.42s -> 25957.54s]  just take it no no no like i eventually you tell me like after 10 years you tell me what the
[25957.54s -> 25973.88s]  combination is so how do i have access to it i don't until 10 years ago yeah trust two million
[25973.88s -> 25980.07s]  dollars to stop streaming would you leave us what do you mean stop like can i do anything else
[25980.95s -> 25990.33s]  can i do can i like do anything else can i like go back to youtube no i have to just leave the
[25990.33s -> 25996.82s]  internet wait but you tell me two million dollars and i have to just delete all my accounts and just
[25996.82s -> 26005.43s]  literally like just don't do anything else no i don't know if i that you're giving me like the
[26005.43s -> 26018.86s]  fucking the button the the two buttons thing where the guy's like oh shit i don't i don't think i
[26018.86s -> 26024.46s]  could do i don't think i could do it what else what the fuck else would i do i mean if we had
[26024.46s -> 26029.10s]  two million dollars we wouldn't have to do anything right you could just like invest half
[26029.10s -> 26034.97s]  of it and then just like sit on a beach every day but i think i would get bored i would get
[26034.97s -> 26040.94s]  bored i would be like oh this is fucking great and after like fucking three years i'd be like
[26040.94s -> 26057.64s]  i need to do something i can't stream anymore i can't like make a video i'd go nuts three years
[26057.64s -> 26063.85s]  is generous it would probably yeah that is it would take like probably two weeks no it would
[26063.85s -> 26077.61s]  be more than that it'd be like a after like two or three months but i i was always under the
[26077.61s -> 26083.77s]  impression that i was going to do this until i didn't think it was interesting or fun anymore
[26085.38s -> 26090.98s]  and if that hasn't happened yet then i will never no matter like oh yeah give me 10 million dollars

[27231.43s -> 27237.29s]  how expensive the whole carnival stream thing is but here's some bits to help you out maybe one
[27237.29s -> 27243.05s]  day we'll talk like i did the germa rumble but i don't want that to be a point of contention or
[27243.85s -> 27248.65s]  talk about that until much later i don't really want to talk about like how much money this
[27248.73s -> 27255.93s]  stream is gonna cost i mean i i think i said a little bit a few maybe like a month ago or so
[27257.26s -> 27264.57s]  but that's not important maybe we'll talk about it some other time but i do thank you so much
[27264.57s -> 27274.18s]  for the five dollars appreciate it that was a jen pendulum thank you uh volemy gave ten dollars

[27318.70s -> 27330.74s]  for this i have been trying to approach people for this for about a year and no it is not a
[27330.90s -> 27341.54s]  massachusetts-based company there's somewhere else and that's it i'll see you guys tomorrow
[27342.18s -> 27349.00s]  thanks for hanging out dos is always fun see you tomorrow for terraria have a good rest of your
[27349.00s -> 27368.60s]  night take care and goodbye get some sleep we got one more bit that came in at one more right now
[27368.60s -> 27373.24s]  by snoozing copter 250 from snoozing copter they say hey germo uh when you don't know where you
[27373.24s -> 27377.80s]  want to be or where you want to go what do you do except for waiting it out i'm sure you and uh
[27377.80s -> 27384.49s]  and everyone can relate i want to hear your thoughts when you don't know where you want
[27384.49s -> 27393.77s]  to be or where you want to go i think well for me at least uh in regards to where i wanted to be
[27396.33s -> 27401.77s]  i kind of just wanted to be somewhere that i knew i was gonna wake up every day and
[27403.21s -> 27410.46s]  be at least interested in where i was and what i was doing at least in a territorial sense
[27411.02s -> 27417.93s]  but in a more elaborate sense of where you want to be a way you want to go i always was of the
[27417.93s -> 27427.99s]  mindset that you you kind of pick a few things that you like and try to have one of them or
[27427.99s -> 27433.40s]  a combination of them work out find what you're interested in find at least two or three things
[27433.40s -> 27439.00s]  that you really are interested in and be happy with any of those things i think a lot of times
[27440.28s -> 27444.84s]  i think a lot of times people can get stuck by putting all their eggs in one basket
[27445.56s -> 27450.76s]  when you should have a few baskets that you are equally excited about and as long as one of them
[27450.76s -> 27462.78s]  works out then you're happy trying to find what you're interested in and then spread out the eggs
[27462.78s -> 27477.75s]  a little get into the carnival business now but it's tough because it's it's tough because
[27477.75s -> 27484.07s]  everybody is interested in different things but i'll tell you just i wanted to do entertainment i
[27484.07s -> 27490.87s]  wanted to be like an entertainer actor comedian whatever that was one of but also i wanted to work
[27490.87s -> 27498.62s]  with animals i was really really into the idea of getting into i like love dogs i love cat love
[27498.62s -> 27505.34s]  animals right so that was another i'm really into that another one was doing uh customer service
[27505.34s -> 27511.42s]  like i like talking to people i'm the big i'm big into having conversations so with customer
[27511.42s -> 27518.14s]  service uh field customer not necessarily support but so any of those three things i
[27518.14s -> 27523.18s]  was going to be happy with because i was actually really interested in all three of them if i had
[27523.18s -> 27531.35s]  been let's say for instance i never did anything on twitch or youtube and instead i fell into
[27531.35s -> 27539.03s]  like a uh like a vet clinic right i would be very happy if i was like a vet tech or
[27539.03s -> 27543.75s]  somebody that worked in the veterinary field right
[27549.54s -> 27556.02s]  or combine them you know find a few things that you like to do and be happy doing any of them
[27556.02s -> 27583.29s]  comedian for pets combine them all be a clown vet but that is honestly the only advice i can really
[27583.29s -> 27589.70s]  give i've been very fortunate to do something and sort of fall into and do something that i really
[27589.70s -> 27596.18s]  really really wanted to do but i was really really happy and passionate about very very fortunate
[27596.18s -> 27603.61s]  to be able to do that but i was prepared to fall back on one of those other couple things
[27607.85s -> 27615.88s]  and that's pretty much that's pretty much what i gotta say i wish you luck i wish you the best
[27618.87s -> 27630.28s]  sometimes you need a change of scenery sometimes you do moving and even if you even change in towns
[27630.92s -> 27635.56s]  or you know going a few miles away if you've been in the same place for a while
[27637.38s -> 27648.82s]  it can help but with that i will see you all tomorrow have a great rest of your night
[27649.38s -> 27653.50s]  get some sleep see you tomorrow good night
