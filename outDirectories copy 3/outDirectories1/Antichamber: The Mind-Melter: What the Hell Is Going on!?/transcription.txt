[0.31s -> 13.82s]  Every journey is a series of choices. The first is to begin the journey.
[13.82s -> 18.82s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Anti-Chamber.
[18.82s -> 23.82s]  I don't really know that much about this game because I just downloaded it, just installed it not that long ago.
[23.82s -> 30.06s]  So all I know about this game is it's weird. It's a weird game, it's got weird mechanics,
[30.06s -> 36.30s]  and it's like a puzzle art project adventure game with a throw-up experience.
[36.30s -> 42.30s]  So I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't think I'm gonna let's play this whole game, unless you guys really want to see that.
[42.30s -> 46.30s]  I'm gonna try and get as far as I can, maybe play for like 15-20 minutes, we'll see.
[46.30s -> 53.36s]  But anyways, time remaining. Do I only have like an hour and a half to beat this whole game? What the hell does that even mean?
[53.36s -> 57.36s]  Alright, all my settings are okay. Let's get started here.
[57.36s -> 60.98s]  No, I do not want to go through the exit. I know you start here, that's all I know.
[60.98s -> 64.48s]  Here we go, choose your destination. Leap of faith, baby.
[64.48s -> 72.43s]  So already this game kind of gives me a headache. If it gives you a headache too, I apologize.
[72.43s -> 77.75s]  Jump! That didn't work. Okay.
[77.75s -> 82.62s]  This game reminds me... Oh, is that another... Whoa. Whoa!
[82.62s -> 87.61s]  Look at it, it's like building the floor around me. Can I like jump on that?
[87.61s -> 93.52s]  What the... What? What the hell did I just even do?
[93.52s -> 103.52s]  Alright, well apparently I fell through like the second floor. I can't get back up there, let's see. What is this?
[103.52s -> 109.59s]  Failing to succeed does not mean failing to progress. Gotcha. Let's go.
[109.59s -> 115.97s]  Let's go down like the secret super 80s hallway. Where's like Janis Joplin?
[115.97s -> 119.91s]  Girls, just wanna have fun. That's not Janis Joplin.
[119.91s -> 124.67s]  Some paths are clearer than others. Alright.
[124.67s -> 129.85s]  Hey, where's like Dilbert? I feel like Dilbert's gonna come out and yell at me. Look at these like comic book graphics.
[129.85s -> 134.82s]  Alright, red or blue? Do I want to be on defense or offense?
[134.82s -> 139.51s]  Alright, let's go on offense. Yay!
[139.51s -> 145.66s]  I don't know what that did. Okay. Hmm, I'm thinking.
[145.66s -> 151.86s]  A choice may be as simple as going left or going right. That's what I just did.
[151.86s -> 156.86s]  Alright, let's go on red team. We're gonna go on like Thunder Mountain on defense on red. I'm gonna play the soldier. Here we go.
[156.86s -> 162.65s]  Oh, this game gives me a headache. What? I already did this.
[162.65s -> 169.01s]  The choice doesn't matter if the outcome is the same. So it does not matter if I go left or right.
[169.01s -> 176.51s]  Hold on, I need some Dr. Pepper to help think about what's going on here. I got it, we're going blue.
[176.51s -> 182.53s]  The stairs up here, though. This game is supposed to teach you to not think regularly.
[182.53s -> 185.53s]  You're supposed to think outside the box. Can I like jump on these stairs?
[185.53s -> 191.29s]  You're telling me I can't like jump and like spin around and go down that way. I definitely can.
[191.29s -> 196.60s]  Jump, spin, freak out. That's not working. Let's just go over here.
[196.60s -> 205.51s]  Again, is there no more clues? Am I really lost on the first puzzle of this goddamn game?
[205.51s -> 211.68s]  Can I like move through here? No, I can't.
[211.68s -> 217.14s]  I can't. It's probably something maybe if I jump like this.
[217.14s -> 227.41s]  Damn it. Hold on a second. What if I go back?
[227.41s -> 231.41s]  Ah, there it is. My house is on fire now.
[231.41s -> 234.41s]  When you return to where you have been, things aren't always as remembered.
[234.41s -> 238.58s]  How are you supposed to figure that out? How are you supposed to figure this out?
[238.58s -> 241.58s]  I just like walked over here because I was being a weirdo.
[241.58s -> 244.58s]  Maybe it's because the stairs are going this way, too?
[244.58s -> 248.58s]  The stairs let go. Wow, this game is for a way smarter person than me.
[248.58s -> 251.58s]  I probably won't even get past level one, guys. I'm not going to lie.
[251.58s -> 254.83s]  Alright, let's go.
[257.65s -> 260.65s]  I don't think I can do this for that much longer.
[260.65s -> 265.98s]  Alright, don't touch. Can I crouch?
[265.98s -> 268.80s]  Alright, apparently I'm supposed to touch that.
[268.80s -> 272.81s]  Should I hit escape right now to not get like laser beamed?
[272.81s -> 278.26s]  Oh, if you don't like where you've ended up, try doing something else.
[278.26s -> 285.90s]  So I ended up back here. Alright.
[285.90s -> 289.17s]  Alright, I did what it told me to.
[289.17s -> 292.17s]  Taking the first step can be harder than the rest of the challenge.
[292.17s -> 297.67s]  That's it? So I shouldn't have even jumped at the beginning? Let's go this way.
[297.67s -> 299.67s]  What the? What the hell just happened?
[299.67s -> 308.12s]  Whoa. Where? Where am I right now? Do I go down?
[308.12s -> 315.58s]  Oh, where am I going? What is happening?
[315.58s -> 321.73s]  What is happening? I am so lost right now.
[321.73s -> 323.73s]  Guys, it's not even funny.
[323.73s -> 326.42s]  I managed to... I'm still going down apparently.
[326.42s -> 330.68s]  Is this like a teleporter? Come on, let's go.
[330.68s -> 336.31s]  Whoa, jump. So do I have to jump? Okay, do I jump down from this?
[336.31s -> 341.66s]  This is really freaking me out. I definitely have to jump straight down.
[341.66s -> 344.86s]  That is definitely an illusion, alright.
[344.86s -> 350.18s]  Yeah. Okay, we're back. Up here again.
[350.18s -> 354.10s]  I gotta jump off. Alright, I get it. I got it. I got it.
[354.10s -> 358.34s]  Here we go. Ready? Ready? Ready? Come on, let's go.
[358.34s -> 361.84s]  Now get me off. Yeah. What does this one say?
[361.84s -> 366.55s]  Dig a little deeper and you may find something new.
[366.55s -> 371.70s]  Should I go down here? No, we're going to go in this room.
[371.70s -> 382.25s]  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What? Alright, whatever. Let's go.
[382.25s -> 387.02s]  What appears impossible may have a very simple answer.
[387.02s -> 390.74s]  Alright, where's your PhD to play this game?
[390.74s -> 395.74s]  How we perceive a problem can change every time we see it.
[395.74s -> 400.20s]  F-E-L-I.
[400.20s -> 402.38s]  F-I-L-I-F-I-F.
[402.38s -> 407.07s]  Felfief? Look at the Illuminati looking at me.
[407.07s -> 413.73s]  What is happening? What is this god damn game?
[413.73s -> 417.54s]  Look at this like trippy freaking...
[417.54s -> 423.39s]  Am I supposed to solve this puzzle? What is that?
[423.39s -> 429.62s]  Where is it going? I'm going to follow this down the hall.
[429.62s -> 435.00s]  Come on, block. Little block. Little purple block.
[435.00s -> 439.21s]  Tick all the way down.
[439.21s -> 444.49s]  This is a trippy room. This is an absolutely trippy room.
[444.49s -> 446.65s]  Can we speed this up here, Block? Let's go.
[446.65s -> 453.72s]  Alright, hold on, I wanna look at the stuff, hold on.
[453.72s -> 457.70s]  Wow. Wow.
[457.70s -> 460.30s]  I'm closing one eye right now, guys.
[460.30s -> 462.86s]  One eye is closed.
[462.86s -> 467.69s]  Because this game is hurting my head.
[467.69s -> 471.90s]  This better be worth it! I better not have to be wasting my time doing this.
[471.90s -> 475.37s]  Hold on, I wanna see where this ends up.
[475.37s -> 478.99s]  Oh, it ends up over here- what the hell?
[481.33s -> 483.24s]  It ends up over here.
[483.24s -> 487.62s]  I'm saying, I am gonna push this all the way.
[487.62s -> 491.17s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[491.17s -> 493.25s]  Make your way across.
[493.25s -> 498.50s]  So what can I talk about while this does this for the next six minutes?
[498.50s -> 502.10s]  Well, we'll talk about the color purple.
[502.10s -> 504.62s]  So what things are purple?
[504.62s -> 508.99s]  Um, lollipops can be purple.
[508.99s -> 514.88s]  The Lakers, the Los Angeles Lakers have purple in their uniform.
[514.88s -> 518.06s]  Hmm, other things that are purple- a grape?
[518.06s -> 521.57s]  You can get purple grapes from the grocery store.
[521.57s -> 523.65s]  They're delicious, they're nice and juicy and cool.
[523.65s -> 526.05s]  And put them in the freezer, they're even better.
[526.05s -> 532.56s]  You can have- alright, hold on, we're almost done, we're almost done.
[532.56s -> 534.00s]  What did this just do?
[534.00s -> 538.94s]  What?
[538.94s -> 541.71s]  Where did it go? I just lost it!
[541.71s -> 543.86s]  When- what?
[543.86s -> 545.95s]  What is in there?
[545.95s -> 550.48s]  Hold on, I wanna find my purple block.
[552.00s -> 554.72s]  This is- this is- what?
[554.72s -> 557.12s]  Did I honestly just do that for no reason?
[557.12s -> 558.72s]  Stop looking at me, I.
[558.72s -> 561.95s]  Oh, I get it.
[561.95s -> 565.25s]  I gotta look at this while I move backwards.
[565.25s -> 566.77s]  Oh, figured it out.
[566.77s -> 572.94s]  A few steps backwards may keep you moving forward.
[572.94s -> 575.79s]  Oh, whoa.
[575.79s -> 581.23s]  This is just renamed this game, Acid Trip the Game.
[581.31s -> 584.13s]  This is just Acid Trip the Game.
[584.77s -> 588.58s]  It simulates taking a ton of acid.
[589.22s -> 594.53s]  Window of opportunity can lead to new places if you are willing to take a closer look.
[597.79s -> 598.11s]  What?
[600.67s -> 603.98s]  So can I- should I like not look at that?
[603.98s -> 604.94s]  Or should I look over here?
[605.66s -> 607.44s]  I'm just gonna go this way.
[609.10s -> 609.34s]  Hey.
[613.60s -> 614.32s]  Where am I?
[615.44s -> 616.24s]  What's happening?
[623.33s -> 623.97s]  Where am I?
[624.93s -> 626.13s]  Where's my flashlight?
[627.97s -> 629.01s]  I don't even know where I'm going.
[631.20s -> 632.72s]  Apparently, I ended up somewhere.
[635.62s -> 637.70s]  Look a little harder and you will find a way forward.
[640.03s -> 640.35s]  What?
[641.15s -> 643.01s]  I- hold on a second.
[643.01s -> 644.61s]  This is the thing that was here earlier.
[646.58s -> 652.74s]  If you said, Jerma, I'll pay you a million dollars to put this where it's supposed to be,
[653.30s -> 654.34s]  I wouldn't get it.
[654.34s -> 655.86s]  I would not get the million dollars.
[658.21s -> 662.05s]  I would have to- I- I'm gonna say it's probably supposed to go right there.
[662.69s -> 664.67s]  But that's definitely not what's supposed to happen.
[668.45s -> 669.41s]  What if I pick this up?
[669.41s -> 670.45s]  Can I pick this up and then leave?
[671.47s -> 673.31s]  Last time I did this, the whole world changed.
[677.18s -> 678.14s]  All right, here we go.
[678.14s -> 679.28s]  It's gonna change.
[679.28s -> 680.16s]  Look at that.
[680.16s -> 680.56s]  Wow.
[682.77s -> 685.01s]  Venturing into the unknown can lead to great rewards.
[685.01s -> 686.85s]  Yeah, I have like this block.
[686.85s -> 689.09s]  I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do with it though.
[689.09s -> 694.75s]  The end may come before we were ready to get there.
[694.75s -> 696.19s]  No, I don't want to go out that way.
[696.19s -> 699.50s]  Yeah, this is the- wait.
[699.50s -> 703.78s]  Did I just beat the game?
[703.78s -> 708.70s]  Life isn't about- life isn't about getting to the end.
[708.70s -> 710.46s]  Oh yeah, I like beat the game.
[710.46s -> 711.42s]  Except I didn't.
[711.42s -> 712.46s]  What about this way?
[712.46s -> 713.18s]  Hey, look at this.
[713.18s -> 716.42s]  More stuff.
[716.42s -> 719.06s]  Look into this thing and the world changes, right?
[719.06s -> 722.18s]  Still holding this blue block.
[722.18s -> 727.70s]  I want to read that.
[727.70s -> 730.22s]  Uh, sure.
[732.03s -> 732.83s]  Why not?
[732.83s -> 736.46s]  Should I go around the other side and look?
[736.46s -> 737.66s]  Oh yes, I should.
[738.53s -> 739.65s]  Hey, hello.
[739.65s -> 744.51s]  At times we need to view the world from someone else's perspective.
[744.51s -> 746.34s]  Very true.
[746.34s -> 747.30s]  Very true.
[747.30s -> 749.71s]  Does that mean I can leave now?
[749.71s -> 750.19s]  It does.
[752.51s -> 755.52s]  Uh, what?
[755.52s -> 759.04s]  Venturing into the unknown can lead to great rewards.
[759.04s -> 760.16s]  Yeah, I already did this.
[762.03s -> 764.11s]  Was I able to go through somewhere else?
[764.11s -> 766.18s]  Still holding.
[766.18s -> 767.14s]  Let's switch this again.
[767.14s -> 769.86s]  Switch this again.
[769.86s -> 771.14s]  Was this thing here last time?
[773.22s -> 775.98s]  Confused.
[775.98s -> 777.58s]  All right, that was not there this time.
[777.58s -> 779.82s]  So now let's open it up again.
[779.82s -> 781.82s]  Let's go through.
[781.82s -> 784.50s]  I can't go that way.
[784.50s -> 787.60s]  What if I put that there?
[787.60s -> 789.78s]  Nope.
[789.78s -> 790.98s]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[790.98s -> 791.78s]  Can't see again.
[794.10s -> 794.50s]  What's that?
[795.06s -> 796.11s]  What's that thing?
[796.67s -> 798.82s]  I want to go in there.
[798.82s -> 800.77s]  Let me in there.
[800.77s -> 801.25s]  Bastard.
[802.62s -> 803.10s]  Wait, hold on.
[803.10s -> 804.14s]  There's another one of these.
[804.14s -> 807.82s]  No, this is back to this weird room.
[809.98s -> 814.75s]  Shit.
[814.75s -> 816.38s]  Damn it.
[816.38s -> 817.98s]  I need two of these friggin' blocks?
[820.50s -> 821.30s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[821.30s -> 822.26s]  Where's the other one?
[822.26s -> 828.10s]  Where's the other block?
[828.10s -> 832.34s]  And that is going to wrap up my initial video on Antichamber.
[832.34s -> 835.06s]  Again, I'm not sure if I'm going to play through this whole thing.
[835.06s -> 836.82s]  I don't think I'm gonna let's play this whole game.
[836.82s -> 842.42s]  Just wanted to give you guys my initial reaction to the craziness that is in this game.
[842.42s -> 847.86s]  Highly recommend this game if you are into the puzzle genre or the physics simulation type genre.
[847.86s -> 849.54s]  Because this one is a mind bender.
[849.54s -> 851.06s]  It truly is, as you've seen in this video.
[851.62s -> 852.98s]  But that's gonna wrap it up, guys.
[852.98s -> 854.02s]  I'll see you all next time.
[854.02s -> 856.42s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
