[194.01s -> 194.31s]  Funny.
[194.91s -> 198.51s]  That was like a plant from chat because I was going to talk about that for a second.
[198.51s -> 199.21s]  It wasn't a big deal.
[201.91s -> 204.81s]  I didn't fall in the toilet, but I sat down on the.
[206.01s -> 207.51s]  Like the toilet rib cage.
[211.29s -> 212.09s]  Not the seat.
[212.39s -> 216.39s]  The seat was up and I sat down on that rigid part.
[221.16s -> 222.06s]  I was in a hurry.
[225.45s -> 234.05s]  I almost wish I had the audio from this this whole thing because I made this old man sound.
[234.25s -> 247.92s]  It was like, hey, it's like, hey, hey, because when I sat down, it just you don't you never you're never expecting that we as humans know the exact
[248.42s -> 256.46s]  distance from ass to seat and even one to two millimeters off your body goes into a panic mode.
[261.33s -> 268.37s]  Once you're not at that spot where you know, it's supposed to be all hell breaks loose and it's holy shit.
[268.37s -> 270.07s]  I'm going I'm sinking through the earth.
[271.58s -> 273.68s]  Then it hurts the shit hurt.
[284.25s -> 302.26s]  I mean, I don't know why I'm not just like ground pounding down on the toilet, but it kind of it kind of hurts your ass distance must be crazy.
[302.26s -> 304.36s]  No, it's not you guys know what I mean.
[305.50s -> 314.10s]  You hit that moment where you're not your ass is not on seat and you know, it's supposed to be and even if it's not even a tenth of an inch, you know it and
[314.10s -> 316.00s]  there's not you're already sitting down.
[316.00s -> 317.00s]  So you're screwed.

[1280.89s -> 1282.69s]  Okay, so we need to go to the jailhouse.
[1284.27s -> 1286.07s]  I need to do I need a key for the jailhouse?
[1295.94s -> 1303.44s]  Whatever guard house.
[1305.00s -> 1305.30s]  All right.
[1305.30s -> 1306.40s]  I need the two seals.
[1314.51s -> 1316.81s]  Remember to return to the phonograph to save the city of
[1316.81s -> 1319.11s]  gloom would only gets more dangerous from here.
[1319.11s -> 1322.51s]  Oh no, I don't remember where the phonograph is.
[1325.00s -> 1325.60s]  Where's the phone?
[1325.60s -> 1326.40s]  Where's the phonograph?
[1338.00s -> 1339.30s]  This game goes hard.
[1340.84s -> 1341.24s]  Isn't it?
[1341.24s -> 1341.94s]  It's in here, right?
[1346.44s -> 1347.44s]  I missed a shotgun.
[1356.63s -> 1358.13s]  Did I actually miss miss the shotgun?
[1365.47s -> 1365.97s]  I did.
[1365.97s -> 1366.77s]  Holy, I thought you were lying.
[1366.87s -> 1367.17s]  Okay.
[1377.20s -> 1378.30s]  So now I gotta go.
[1378.30s -> 1378.60s]  I don't know.
[1378.60s -> 1379.90s]  Where's the where's the safe thing?
[1393.42s -> 1393.92s]  Way too dank.
[1393.92s -> 1394.32s]  I'm sorry.
[1394.32s -> 1397.12s]  I put a limiter on the mic too and I can't doesn't fix it.
[1409.64s -> 1410.94s]  We'll do some tests on it in a minute.
[1417.78s -> 1418.38s]  Where'd that guy go?
[1418.88s -> 1419.48s]  Oh fuck.
[1424.16s -> 1425.36s]  If I lean out, can they see me?
[1425.86s -> 1427.76s]  Can this guy that it's can that guy see me when I do that?
[1457.78s -> 1459.38s]  What I did a backstab.
[1459.78s -> 1460.78s]  Did I just do a backstab?
[1461.28s -> 1462.28s]  I thought I just backstabbed him.
[1462.28s -> 1466.65s]  Oh, it has to blink.
[1466.65s -> 1467.75s]  Okay, it has to blink.
[1472.05s -> 1472.55s]  I get it.
[1474.79s -> 1475.69s]  Nice face stab.
[1475.69s -> 1476.69s]  That was a backstab.
[1476.69s -> 1477.69s]  It just didn't register.
[1484.18s -> 1485.08s]  What can you do with the money?
[1489.86s -> 1490.56s]  Wait, hold on.
[1490.56s -> 1493.76s]  Did the dev say this demo is so old and crusty?
[1493.76s -> 1496.16s]  Did the dev say the demo is old and crusty?
[1500.30s -> 1500.80s]  What?
[1502.67s -> 1506.17s]  Wait, the dev came in here and said, oh God, this demo is so
[1506.17s -> 1507.47s]  old and crusty.
[1508.17s -> 1509.07s]  I think it's good.
[1510.10s -> 1512.20s]  It's an old build compared to what they're working on now.
[1520.98s -> 1521.98s]  I don't think it's crusty.
[1522.18s -> 1523.18s]  What do you mean crusty?
[1525.37s -> 1525.67s]  All right.
[1525.67s -> 1526.77s]  Here's a power station.
[1527.97s -> 1529.27s]  Can I do a force pull on it?
[1538.85s -> 1540.05s]  All right, power station.
[1544.29s -> 1545.89s]  Jeremy, you're old and crusty too.
[1545.89s -> 1546.69s]  Yeah, so it's fine.
[1547.79s -> 1548.59s]  All right, relax.
[1558.38s -> 1565.38s]  Hey guys, if that was in the game, wouldn't it be better?
[1585.65s -> 1586.45s]  Where's this person?
[1603.80s -> 1605.10s]  Trying to distract him.
[1623.16s -> 1624.16s]  Okay, I don't know.
[1624.16s -> 1625.36s]  Why do I even sneak?
[1626.26s -> 1627.66s]  But I even why would I even be sneaking?
[1627.66s -> 1629.66s]  I'm just crouching around shooting people with a shotgun.
[1630.06s -> 1631.46s]  Why wouldn't I just shoot them?
[1631.96s -> 1632.76s]  Just shoot them.
[1640.30s -> 1640.90s]  Is this a gun?
[1644.17s -> 1645.87s]  This is the third broken rifle this week.
[1647.07s -> 1647.97s]  It's a stealth game.
[1648.67s -> 1650.37s]  I'm not good at stealth games.
[1655.11s -> 1657.71s]  I don't some of you guys want to make like a big blueprint
[1657.71s -> 1659.11s]  before you get in the level and be like this is where I'm
[1659.11s -> 1660.91s]  going to go and that X right there.
[1660.91s -> 1662.61s]  That's where I'm going to stay for five minutes.
[1662.61s -> 1664.81s]  I'm going to go cook pasta and come back and then when the
[1664.81s -> 1666.91s]  guy makes his rounds, I'm going to go sneak behind him do
[1666.91s -> 1669.01s]  one tap on his head and then this exit.
[1669.01s -> 1671.81s]  No, I'm my brains too small to do that.
[1672.01s -> 1672.71s]  I can't do that.
[1675.60s -> 1677.30s]  The shotgun ammo is very rare.
[1681.55s -> 1683.95s]  Like so you guys have some of you guys are very meticulous
[1683.95s -> 1686.95s]  and you want to plan out your routes and that's fun and
[1686.95s -> 1687.75s]  that you can do that.
[1687.75s -> 1689.75s]  You can do that in your game, but I want to throw a bottle
[1689.75s -> 1690.85s]  at somebody's face point blank.
[1692.44s -> 1698.52s]  Oh shit and hey guess what do we both get to the end of
[1698.52s -> 1707.56s]  the level see me walking around going like this and you
[1707.56s -> 1711.52s]  like sneaking around and like we both get to the end of
[1711.52s -> 1712.92s]  the level it and we both get it.
[1712.92s -> 1714.12s]  We both get a passing grade.
[1718.88s -> 1719.78s]  I don't want to hear it.
[1728.91s -> 1731.01s]  Okay, that's what that's one another gun.
[1732.38s -> 1742.08s]  This is dual welding 2.6 GPA.
[1742.28s -> 1742.58s]  Yeah.
[1748.54s -> 1751.66s]  Okay, so I got that is the key.
[1751.66s -> 1755.95s]  What that what key is that for does it say warden court
[1755.95s -> 1760.80s]  key for the door near the jailhouse shotgun?
[1761.20s -> 1762.90s]  I got a lot of ammo cheese.
[1762.90s -> 1763.50s]  Oh eat this.
[1766.33s -> 1766.83s]  That's it.
[1770.60s -> 1773.40s]  I just ate five wheels of cheese.
[1784.36s -> 1786.16s]  Okay, so I now the door near the jailhouse.
[1786.16s -> 1792.02s]  I got one of the Resident Evil puzzle piece stones.
[1805.64s -> 1806.54s]  So the dev is here, right?
[1806.54s -> 1809.54s]  Well, when are you going to add the breadcrumb the golden
[1809.54s -> 1812.54s]  breadcrumb trail that goes of GPS to where I need to go?
[1814.60s -> 1815.80s]  I thought that was going to be in the game.
[1816.00s -> 1818.40s]  I was like, so I was kind of convinced it was I don't know
[1818.40s -> 1819.00s]  why it's not here.
[1821.29s -> 1822.29s]  I'm like, I don't want to die.
[1822.29s -> 1826.06s]  I don't really want to say I'm disappointed but I mean
[1827.12s -> 1828.72s]  whatever it's now whatever.
[1828.82s -> 1830.52s]  Sorry, I'm sure that they'll add it later.
[1830.52s -> 1836.48s]  I think that just scared the shit out of me.
[1836.48s -> 1838.58s]  I thought I was going to get zapped by Darth cities.
[1839.65s -> 1840.95s]  I just thought I thought a guy was sitting there.
[1840.95s -> 1842.45s]  We're just waiting for me with hands.
[1842.55s -> 1842.95s]  I don't know.
[1842.95s -> 1843.65s]  I just made it up.
[1846.06s -> 1847.16s]  Okay, let's put this in.
[1847.46s -> 1848.66s]  I need one art jailhouse.
[1850.86s -> 1851.76s]  It's back this way.
[1857.74s -> 1859.24s]  It's kind of near the beginning, isn't it?
[1861.68s -> 1862.88s]  Are you going to save the game yet?
[1865.20s -> 1867.40s]  I mean you might need save points.
[1868.44s -> 1872.74s]  I'm a hardcore gamer though and we didn't have save points
[1874.03s -> 1877.73s]  when you got to level five in the Lion King on Super Nintendo
[1877.93s -> 1879.93s]  and when you lost you had to do the whole game over again.
[1882.86s -> 1883.66s]  That's what I was used to.
[1887.20s -> 1888.20s]  Okay, let me go down here.
[1893.93s -> 1895.23s]  Wait, should I wait this is different.
[1895.43s -> 1896.43s]  Okay, I'm going to get this right.
[1904.23s -> 1905.53s]  This is completely inaccurate.
[1905.53s -> 1906.83s]  I'm not I don't look good at this.
[1907.67s -> 1908.47s]  You know what I am good at?
[1908.47s -> 1910.37s]  I'd walk around the corner be like, excuse me, sir.
[1910.57s -> 1911.27s]  How are you?
[1911.27s -> 1912.77s]  Oh, my name.
[1912.77s -> 1913.67s]  Can I please shake your hand?
[1913.67s -> 1914.57s]  I would like shake his hand.
[1914.57s -> 1918.04s]  We talk like I'm the guy that distracts the guards.
[1918.04s -> 1920.74s]  I'm not the guy that sneaks into the castle.
[1921.24s -> 1923.54s]  I'm the one that walks up and does like a goofy routine
[1923.54s -> 1927.24s]  and distracts the guards while I do like magic tricks for them
[1927.24s -> 1928.54s]  and then laugh and clap and stuff.
[1928.54s -> 1931.04s]  And then the main character gets to go into the castle
[1931.84s -> 1933.24s]  and then guess what I get to go home.
[1933.34s -> 1934.44s]  I get to go home after that.
[1940.22s -> 1941.22s]  I did my job.
[1953.90s -> 1954.80s]  Okay, they didn't see that good.
[1961.81s -> 1974.98s]  Oh God, it looked cool.
[1975.68s -> 1976.58s]  It looked cool.
[1986.45s -> 1987.35s]  He's a jester.
[1989.41s -> 1990.31s]  What do you guys think?
[1990.41s -> 1992.11s]  Okay back in old medieval times.
[1992.11s -> 1993.51s]  What do you think I would be?
[1995.18s -> 1995.48s]  I don't know.
[1995.48s -> 1996.78s]  Everybody has this thing in their mind.
[1996.78s -> 1999.08s]  No, I'd be the sword wielding hero.
[1999.18s -> 2000.08s]  No, no, I wouldn't.
[2001.70s -> 2004.30s]  I would be dancing around the dinner table.
[2006.46s -> 2007.26s]  You'd be dead.
[2007.36s -> 2008.06s]  No, I wouldn't.
[2012.77s -> 2015.17s]  I'm not going to be the guy with the, you know, the rape here.
[2015.57s -> 2015.97s]  Like...
[2018.47s -> 2019.17s]  Oh, please.
[2019.17s -> 2019.57s]  No.
[2032.81s -> 2034.21s]  Did you have a Red Bull today?
[2035.34s -> 2036.54s]  I don't drink Red Bull.
[2037.24s -> 2038.84s]  I'm just a fucking weirdo.
[2039.44s -> 2040.14s]  I think.
[2040.24s -> 2040.84s]  I don't know.
[2042.97s -> 2044.37s]  No, I'm not even a weirdo.
[2044.77s -> 2045.57s]  You're the weird ones.
[2045.57s -> 2046.07s]  Not me.
[2051.72s -> 2053.32s]  You're the town fool.
[2055.22s -> 2056.02s]  Is my head too...
[2056.42s -> 2057.32s]  Can you see me?
[2062.36s -> 2062.96s]  Copium.
[2062.96s -> 2063.96s]  I'm just kidding around.
[2067.45s -> 2068.95s]  Yeah, I would not be the...
[2070.08s -> 2071.68s]  No, I'm not going to be the hero.
[2075.31s -> 2075.91s]  Don't turn around.
[2075.91s -> 2076.51s]  Don't turn around.
[2076.51s -> 2077.11s]  Don't turn around.
[2077.11s -> 2077.71s]  Don't turn around.
[2077.71s -> 2078.31s]  Don't turn around.
[2078.31s -> 2078.91s]  Don't turn around.
[2078.91s -> 2079.61s]  Don't turn around.
[2084.63s -> 2111.90s]  All right, nice.
[2114.30s -> 2116.20s]  Cistern entry.
[2121.66s -> 2122.96s]  You want to relive the Lion King?
[2122.96s -> 2125.76s]  He walked by the save room like three times.
[2130.42s -> 2132.72s]  Nobody wants to relive the Lion King.
[2133.32s -> 2133.92s]  No one.
[2140.71s -> 2141.61s]  That was so off.
[2141.61s -> 2144.31s]  I was trying to arc that so badly that it was going to hit him in the head
[2144.31s -> 2145.61s]  and it was completely off.
[2147.19s -> 2147.69s]  Somebody's coming.
[2147.69s -> 2148.09s]  Somebody's coming.
[2148.09s -> 2148.69s]  Somebody's coming.
[2149.89s -> 2150.49s]  Somebody's coming.
[2150.49s -> 2152.09s]  Somebody's coming in the room right now.
[2162.82s -> 2164.62s]  Despises that the Lion King is not good.
[2172.23s -> 2173.03s]  Where is this guy?
[2174.41s -> 2175.31s]  Did he not come up here?
[2177.78s -> 2178.38s]  The Lion King...
[2178.38s -> 2179.68s]  The movie is fine.
[2179.68s -> 2181.78s]  The video game was just hell on Earth.
[2198.08s -> 2199.38s]  What did you guys think I was talking about?
[2202.32s -> 2203.82s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2203.92s -> 2208.62s]  Did you guys think I was talking about trying to watch through the
[2208.62s -> 2213.10s]  Lion King movie and there's no save points?
[2217.05s -> 2218.25s]  What am I going to go make?
[2218.85s -> 2219.45s]  Wait, what?
[2219.45s -> 2220.45s]  What are you talking about?
[2221.81s -> 2225.11s]  I'm talking about the Lion King, the video game for the SNES.
[2225.11s -> 2225.51s]  That's what I...
[2225.51s -> 2226.01s]  Wait, why?
[2226.01s -> 2227.31s]  I think you guys are getting confused.
[2240.38s -> 2241.68s]  I said game like three times.
[2241.68s -> 2241.88s]  Yeah.
[2241.88s -> 2242.68s]  Ooh, lantern.
[2244.45s -> 2245.25s]  Oh goodness.
[2246.03s -> 2247.33s]  Does this cost oil?
[2248.72s -> 2249.52s]  It probably does.
[2256.35s -> 2257.65s]  Fully visible to enemies.
[2271.26s -> 2273.26s]  Does that mean I'm invisible to enemies in the dark?
[2275.12s -> 2276.42s]  That's kind of what that means, right?
[2276.92s -> 2280.18s]  I'm fully visible, but not right now.
[2280.18s -> 2280.78s]  Is there a bottle?
[2281.08s -> 2281.48s]  Give me this.
[2287.72s -> 2291.12s]  I think a bug just blew in my eye and it probably was on camera.
[2294.78s -> 2295.58s]  How do I get him to open the door?
[2302.86s -> 2305.06s]  There's a little entrance over there in the wall.
[2310.80s -> 2311.70s]  Should I follow him?
[2314.46s -> 2316.06s]  If I aggro him, will he come out somehow?
[2321.35s -> 2322.15s]  All right, come on then.
[2322.25s -> 2322.65s]  Get out here.
[2323.97s -> 2324.67s]  Come and get me then.
[2325.07s -> 2326.17s]  Come open the door and come get me.
[2329.60s -> 2330.40s]  All right, where's he going?
[2339.90s -> 2340.70s]  Can I turn this off?
[2347.45s -> 2347.75s]  I don't know.
[2366.73s -> 2367.13s]  Huh?
[2371.48s -> 2372.18s]  Oh God.
[2373.88s -> 2374.18s]  These...
[2374.38s -> 2376.08s]  Oh, these are freshly fired.
[2376.08s -> 2376.98s]  All right, give me the shotgun.
[2387.33s -> 2390.33s]  What the fuck is that sound that I just heard?
[2390.33s -> 2391.73s]  What the fuck was that sound?
[2392.23s -> 2394.03s]  What the hell was that sound?
[2395.10s -> 2396.40s]  That was horrifying.
[2399.53s -> 2400.63s]  Oh, I hate this.
[2411.24s -> 2412.34s]  Was it in front of me?
[2412.34s -> 2412.64s]  Was it...
[2413.38s -> 2414.08s]  Was it in front of...
[2414.08s -> 2415.18s]  Was it right in front of me?
[2415.18s -> 2415.68s]  And it's just...
[2415.68s -> 2416.38s]  There was no light?
[2420.20s -> 2420.50s]  I think...
[2420.50s -> 2421.50s]  I literally think I was looking at it.
[2421.50s -> 2423.10s]  I think I was looking at it and it was dark.
[2429.48s -> 2430.28s]  Oh goodness.
[2435.89s -> 2436.39s]  Is it me?
[2438.09s -> 2438.79s]  That wasn't me.
[2439.29s -> 2440.09s]  That wasn't me.
[2440.09s -> 2440.99s]  That was not me.
[2457.88s -> 2458.48s]  Safe point.
[2463.40s -> 2463.80s]  I got it.
[2470.06s -> 2470.76s]  Storage.
[2471.60s -> 2472.50s]  Door control.
[2475.13s -> 2475.53s]  What?
[2475.93s -> 2476.63s]  What the hell was that?
[2481.96s -> 2482.36s]  What?
[2482.86s -> 2484.66s]  This is a weird thing over there.
[2502.04s -> 2502.44s]  Okay.
[2502.74s -> 2503.34s]  Okay.
[2503.34s -> 2503.84s]  Okay.
[2504.24s -> 2505.14s]  There's the thing there.
[2518.42s -> 2519.82s]  It's like a fucking bird.
[2521.97s -> 2524.07s]  Can I kill this in one hit with a backstab?
[2524.07s -> 2525.17s]  I need a DEV confirmation.
[2526.88s -> 2527.98s]  I need a DEV confirmation.
[2533.34s -> 2534.04s]  Oh shit.
[2538.84s -> 2539.94s]  Will it see me right here?
[2543.60s -> 2544.70s]  It won't see me right here, right?
[2545.00s -> 2545.60s]  Will it see me right?
[2545.60s -> 2547.40s]  I need to DEV post on Twitter right now.
[2547.80s -> 2548.70s]  Will it see me in this dark?
[2548.70s -> 2549.40s]  DEV post on Twitter.
[2549.40s -> 2549.90s]  Will it see me?
[2572.59s -> 2573.39s]  Where the fuck am I?
[2574.33s -> 2574.83s]  Okay, right here.
[2574.83s -> 2575.43s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[2575.43s -> 2575.93s]  Storage.
[2580.93s -> 2582.23s]  It's not coming over here, right?
[2584.22s -> 2585.12s]  What the hell was that over there?
[2585.12s -> 2585.72s]  There were eyes over there.
[2585.72s -> 2586.12s]  What the...
[2586.32s -> 2586.92s]  Relax.
[2587.12s -> 2588.02s]  No, that's not eyes.
[2589.16s -> 2589.96s]  No, no, no, no.
[2589.96s -> 2590.66s]  Get out of here.
[2590.66s -> 2591.86s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[2593.88s -> 2594.88s]  There's one in the room right now.
[2601.07s -> 2601.47s]  Is there?
[2608.27s -> 2608.97s]  No, just put it down.
[2608.97s -> 2609.27s]  Put it down.
[2623.69s -> 2626.09s]  2010 YouTuber reaction.
[2627.19s -> 2628.29s]  DEV said, yeah, backstab it.
[2628.29s -> 2628.69s]  It works.
[2634.76s -> 2635.76s]  2010, man.
[2635.76s -> 2637.46s]  I'm traveling back in time.
[2640.25s -> 2641.05s]  Is there two?
[2641.35s -> 2642.25s]  I think there are two.
[2645.40s -> 2646.30s]  I think there are two.
[2649.68s -> 2650.58s]  This sucks.
[2676.95s -> 2677.95s]  No, no, no.
[2677.95s -> 2689.94s]  I'm sorry.
[2689.94s -> 2691.14s]  It's fucking 2010.
[2691.84s -> 2692.74s]  I'm sorry.
[2697.71s -> 2701.89s]  Okay, that wasn't that bad.
[2701.89s -> 2703.09s]  Okay, they die in like one hit.
[2703.09s -> 2703.99s]  They die in one hit.
[2704.49s -> 2704.99s]  Two hits.
[2706.02s -> 2707.52s]  Your mic sucks, dude.
[2707.92s -> 2709.02s]  I'm fixing it right now.
[2709.32s -> 2710.12s]  I'm pausing it.
[2710.12s -> 2711.02s]  I'm fixing it right now.
[2711.42s -> 2711.82s]  You tell...
[2711.82s -> 2712.62s]  Look, here we go.
[2712.82s -> 2713.42s]  I'm fixing it.
[2713.62s -> 2714.12s]  You ready?
[2714.12s -> 2715.12s]  My mic sucks.
[2715.12s -> 2715.92s]  Hold on, give me a second.
[2715.92s -> 2717.22s]  I swear to God, this is gonna take two minutes.
[2719.11s -> 2719.61s]  Okay, here we go.
[2719.61s -> 2720.01s]  Ready?
[2723.53s -> 2724.03s]  Here we go.
[2725.56s -> 2727.16s]  You tell me when it's better.
[2728.98s -> 2731.08s]  Oh, oh my God, bro.
[2731.28s -> 2732.28s]  Oh my God.
[2732.28s -> 2732.78s]  Is that better?
[2734.04s -> 2735.24s]  Oh my God, bro.
[2735.24s -> 2737.24s]  Whoa, what the fuck is happening?
[2737.64s -> 2738.04s]  Better?
[2738.90s -> 2739.50s]  Is that better?
[2746.25s -> 2747.15s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[2747.35s -> 2748.75s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[2753.87s -> 2754.77s]  Second one's worse.
[2758.45s -> 2759.15s]  First one better.
[2760.97s -> 2761.67s]  So this one right here.
[2761.67s -> 2762.57s]  This one, this is pretty good.
[2763.34s -> 2764.74s]  Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2764.74s -> 2765.54s]  Easy, easy, man.
[2765.54s -> 2765.94s]  Easy.
[2765.94s -> 2767.54s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[2767.64s -> 2767.94s]  Better?
[2776.28s -> 2776.98s]  It's crunchy.
[2777.85s -> 2779.15s]  I can't, I don't think I can make it not...
[2779.15s -> 2781.05s]  I mean, I'm yelling into a microphone.
[2783.20s -> 2784.70s]  Nice fucking eye exam, dude.
[2790.04s -> 2790.84s]  Stop screaming.
[2790.84s -> 2791.74s]  I can't help it.
[2792.04s -> 2796.71s]  I'm an overreacting YouTube Andy.
[2796.81s -> 2797.21s]  Okay.
[2797.21s -> 2798.41s]  I, that's not going to change.
[2800.50s -> 2801.00s]  All right, let's go.
[2801.20s -> 2802.70s]  I think that's in a better spot than it was last time.
[2802.70s -> 2803.20s]  All right, let's go.
[2803.20s -> 2803.40s]  Let's go.
[2803.40s -> 2804.20s]  Let's go, go, go, go, go.
[2805.70s -> 2806.40s]  That's, that's better.
[2806.70s -> 2807.00s]  We're good.
[2807.00s -> 2807.40s]  We're fine.
[2807.40s -> 2807.80s]  Everything's fine.
[2818.63s -> 2819.33s]  This one's worse.
[2819.33s -> 2820.13s]  How is this one worse?
[2821.83s -> 2823.33s]  Dude, you need to get a blue Yeti.
[2829.14s -> 2832.74s]  I remember those were, those were all the rage back in 2010.
[2833.97s -> 2835.07s]  A blue Yeti.
[2835.37s -> 2837.77s]  No, a blue snowball was the big one, right?
[2838.61s -> 2840.81s]  Dude, every single person had a blue snowball.
[2841.21s -> 2845.31s]  If you could buy stock in the blue snowball company back in
[2845.31s -> 2851.11s]  like 2008 and just sell it in 2012, you, you probably would
[2851.11s -> 2853.41s]  have made a fucking shitload of money if that was actually,
[2853.41s -> 2854.71s]  if they were actually publicly traded.
[2856.29s -> 2856.99s]  I swear to God.
[2856.99s -> 2859.29s]  I think every human being that was in front of a computer
[2859.29s -> 2860.79s]  in 2010 had a snowball.
[2862.54s -> 2863.34s]  And let's be honest.
[2864.14s -> 2864.94s]  They worked great.
[2866.49s -> 2867.69s]  They were cheap.
[2867.89s -> 2869.59s]  They weren't that expensive and they just plugged it in
[2869.59s -> 2870.09s]  and it was ready.
[2873.20s -> 2873.40s]  All right.
[2873.40s -> 2875.40s]  What did I, did I complete my task here?
[2879.64s -> 2883.75s]  The blue snowball is still kind of good, but every single
[2883.75s -> 2884.75s]  fucking person had one.
[2887.00s -> 2889.80s]  Oh dude, when they came up with the blue Yeti pro.
[2891.09s -> 2891.49s]  Oh yeah.
[2892.59s -> 2895.00s]  Hey, I'm going to get that one.
[2895.30s -> 2896.40s]  I want to sound like a pro.
[2899.95s -> 2902.25s]  Yeah, I've used the snowball before.
[2905.62s -> 2906.42s]  It works great.
[2910.43s -> 2910.63s]  All right.
[2910.63s -> 2911.43s]  Am I doing this right?
[2912.43s -> 2913.43s]  I got, well, I can read.
[2913.43s -> 2913.83s]  Let me read.
[2919.10s -> 2919.50s]  Apologies.
[2919.70s -> 2920.70s]  Oh wait, I already saw this one.
[2921.40s -> 2922.30s]  So what is this thing?
[2926.05s -> 2927.05s]  It's like a crank.
[2934.84s -> 2935.44s]  What does this go?
[2938.71s -> 2939.41s]  Is there a crank?
[2941.88s -> 2942.38s]  Excuse me.
[2948.89s -> 2950.29s]  Do you remember the movie Crank?
[2952.54s -> 2956.24s]  If the guy's heartbeat of his heart rate went down to a
[2956.24s -> 2959.24s]  certain beats per minute, his heart exploded.
[2963.06s -> 2964.76s]  What a fucking hilarious movie.
[2966.34s -> 2966.64s]  All right.
[2966.64s -> 2967.54s]  Should I put it on here?
[2971.06s -> 2971.96s]  Okay, main canal.
[2973.62s -> 2974.62s]  Yeah, this is the movie.
[2974.72s -> 2976.92s]  If you guys, if you guys didn't know the movie Crank,
[2977.86s -> 2980.16s]  it's a movie about a guy who gets some type of like drug
[2980.16s -> 2982.86s]  or something injected into him or he has like a fake heart
[2982.86s -> 2983.46s]  or something.
[2983.46s -> 2984.76s]  They give him a fake heart.
[2984.86s -> 2985.76s]  That's like an electrical.
[2985.76s -> 2986.06s]  I don't know.
[2986.56s -> 2988.26s]  I don't even know what the plot of the movie is.
[2988.76s -> 2992.46s]  All I know is it's like the movie Speed where you know,
[2992.46s -> 2994.36s]  in the movie Speed, you have to go a certain miles per
[2994.36s -> 2995.76s]  hour on the bus.
[2996.26s -> 2998.86s]  This guy had to keep his heart rate up if it went underneath
[2998.86s -> 3001.66s]  his heart would explode and they made a sequel.
[3002.74s -> 3004.24s]  Yeah, insane.
[3007.90s -> 3008.60s]  Okay, where is it?
[3012.35s -> 3013.05s]  Can I use it?
[3013.05s -> 3013.65s]  How do I use it?
[3023.61s -> 3024.71s]  No, it's not going to work.
[3025.99s -> 3026.69s]  Does that not work?
[3028.04s -> 3028.34s]  That's it.
[3028.34s -> 3029.44s]  I need to put it right here, right?
[3030.95s -> 3031.85s]  Press the use button.
[3032.05s -> 3033.05s]  Oh my god.
[3033.05s -> 3034.65s]  Okay, we're good main main canal.
[3034.75s -> 3035.35s]  All right, let's go.
[3042.27s -> 3042.97s]  Something in my eye.
[3048.48s -> 3051.08s]  I'm loading my shotgun up just in case one of those bird
[3051.18s -> 3052.28s]  things shows up.
[3055.07s -> 3055.87s]  Main canal.
[3056.65s -> 3057.35s]  Pump room.
[3066.70s -> 3067.40s]  What the fuck?
[3080.93s -> 3081.83s]  Oh god damn it.
[3081.83s -> 3099.81s]  No, just go back back back back.
[3109.00s -> 3109.50s]  I can do it.
[3132.66s -> 3133.66s]  I don't know which side he's on.
[3133.96s -> 3135.46s]  I don't know which side he's on.
[3136.26s -> 3137.06s]  He's right in front of me.
[3137.46s -> 3138.46s]  I don't know which side he's on.
[3145.18s -> 3145.68s]  Nobody here.
[3145.98s -> 3146.58s]  Which side is he?
[3150.67s -> 3152.17s]  I got to keep my fucking heart rate up, mate.
[3152.17s -> 3154.47s]  I just keep punching people in the fucking face, man.
[3156.34s -> 3159.04s]  Are you fucking trying to tell me that fuck my heart rate
[3159.04s -> 3162.74s]  goes down under 14,000 fucking beats per minute, mate?
[3164.37s -> 3165.47s]  Oh god, I'm in trouble now.
[3166.37s -> 3166.77s]  I have to run.
[3166.77s -> 3167.37s]  How do I get out of here?
[3171.96s -> 3174.56s]  Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.
[3174.56s -> 3176.26s]  Joke was more important than playing the game.
[3176.36s -> 3178.56s]  Joke was up here playing game down here.
[3179.26s -> 3180.46s]  Way more important apparently.
[3188.15s -> 3189.05s]  I'm not afraid now.
[3192.10s -> 3193.20s]  No, I'm not even afraid.
[3195.26s -> 3195.76s]  Let's go.
[3200.63s -> 3202.03s]  Now, now I'm annoyed.
[3202.03s -> 3202.63s]  Let's go.
[3207.64s -> 3208.34s]  I'm not afraid.
[3220.03s -> 3220.43s]  Come on.
[3224.97s -> 3225.77s]  Hey, stupid.
[3226.37s -> 3227.17s]  Why don't you come up here?
[3227.97s -> 3228.97s]  But only come one at a time though.
[3230.10s -> 3230.40s]  What?
[3243.15s -> 3243.65s]  Where?
[3243.65s -> 3244.05s]  What?
[3248.16s -> 3249.16s]  Oh my god, he's behind me.
[3258.49s -> 3259.19s]  I have to sneak.
[3259.19s -> 3259.99s]  I can't attack him.
[3259.99s -> 3261.09s]  I can't, I have to sneak around.
[3262.50s -> 3263.30s]  I just have to sneak around.
[3263.30s -> 3264.20s]  You can't attack them.
[3264.60s -> 3265.60s]  Attacking is wrong.
[3265.60s -> 3266.30s]  It needs to go.
[3270.83s -> 3271.73s]  It's a stealth game.
[3271.83s -> 3274.93s]  I know, but I, I can't do stealth games.
[3278.85s -> 3281.05s]  There are two things in this world that I cannot do.
[3281.99s -> 3288.11s]  Stealth adventure and a Tetris.
[3293.30s -> 3294.60s]  Or most math problems.
[3300.82s -> 3301.62s]  Who even saw me?
[3308.95s -> 3310.35s]  Thank god, there's no bullets in this gun.
[3310.35s -> 3312.75s]  I would have shot it and I would have, I gave my position away.
[3318.57s -> 3319.97s]  Oh my god, what are they doing?
[3344.97s -> 3346.57s]  They're sprinting around.
[3347.17s -> 3348.27s]  What am I supposed to do?
[3362.63s -> 3363.03s]  What?
[3363.03s -> 3363.43s]  Where?
[3363.53s -> 3364.23s]  Where are you?
[3366.16s -> 3366.96s]  What the fuck?
[3398.18s -> 3399.18s]  God damn it.
[3403.84s -> 3405.04s]  All right, turn it back down.
[3405.04s -> 3406.74s]  I got to get, I'm almost at the end of the demo.
[3406.74s -> 3407.34s]  I imagine.
[3409.90s -> 3411.40s]  I'm going to turn it back down to where it was.
[3412.60s -> 3413.00s]  Here.
[3414.19s -> 3415.89s]  See, it's back down to where it was.
[3421.20s -> 3421.60s]  That was fun.
[3421.60s -> 3422.60s]  Was that loud too?
[3422.80s -> 3424.10s]  Was that like crunchy and horrible?
[3430.48s -> 3430.88s]  Yes.
[3431.18s -> 3439.80s]  God damn it.
[3439.80s -> 3440.80s]  This part's hard.
[3447.28s -> 3448.48s]  I'm just gonna kill them.
[3449.54s -> 3450.04s]  Fuck it.
[3451.26s -> 3452.66s]  I'm doing it my way.
[3455.14s -> 3457.24s]  And that's stand right here in the light.
[3457.94s -> 3458.84s]  It is this three.
[3459.87s -> 3460.97s]  This guy's dead right now.
[3461.47s -> 3461.97s]  There's one.
[3462.17s -> 3462.67s]  There's one.
[3462.67s -> 3463.17s]  There's one.
[3463.17s -> 3463.67s]  There's one.
[3463.67s -> 3464.27s]  Here comes two.
[3464.27s -> 3464.87s]  Where's two?
[3465.17s -> 3465.87s]  Here it comes.
[3466.17s -> 3466.77s]  Right there.
[3467.57s -> 3468.97s]  Why is there only one shot in this gun?
[3471.17s -> 3471.97s]  There's your second.
[3472.47s -> 3473.27s]  Where's the third one?
[3487.87s -> 3488.27s]  Let's go.
[3498.67s -> 3499.37s]  Let's do the piece.
[3524.28s -> 3525.28s]  Hey, hey boys and girls.
[3525.28s -> 3532.39s]  That would be a fucked up start to Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.
[3537.93s -> 3540.23s]  What a weird intro.
[3546.05s -> 3547.15s]  He's kind of like a monkey.
[3547.75s -> 3548.95s]  Or I have to get out of here.
[3551.49s -> 3552.29s]  Where's the exit?
[3557.03s -> 3559.13s]  Okay, there's not gonna be another one spawning, right?
[3561.72s -> 3562.52s]  Okay, I got bullets.
[3565.28s -> 3565.98s]  Get out of here.
[3569.00s -> 3570.30s]  Go, go, go, go, go, get out, out, out.
[3586.84s -> 3587.94s]  I'm feeling to full health.
[3588.24s -> 3589.34s]  It's just a demo guys.
[3589.34s -> 3590.34s]  I'm gonna get to the end of the demo.
[3591.44s -> 3601.04s]  Oh, okay.
[3601.04s -> 3601.84s]  This is like a shortcut.
[3602.44s -> 3603.34s]  This looks wrong.
[3603.44s -> 3604.34s]  Oh, it's cuz I was cheating.
[3616.80s -> 3617.00s]  Okay.
[3617.00s -> 3618.30s]  Now that I was gonna go to that door.
[3620.29s -> 3620.79s]  I did it.
[3620.89s -> 3621.29s]  All right.
[3621.49s -> 3622.19s]  That was fun.
[3622.69s -> 3623.79s]  That's terrifying but fun.
[3628.29s -> 3628.79s]  There we go.
[3629.09s -> 3629.59s]  Hell, yeah.
[3634.78s -> 3635.28s]  Is there more?
[3641.99s -> 3642.59s]  Stanley?
[3643.59s -> 3644.99s]  Stanley walked into the church.
[3654.75s -> 3655.25s]  Very good.
[3656.79s -> 3657.19s]  That was good.
[3657.19s -> 3658.29s]  That was intense.
[3659.78s -> 3660.58s]  That was Gloomwood.
[3661.48s -> 3664.58s]  Uh, explore the early access August 16th.
[3666.58s -> 3668.88s]  I'd mark that one on your calendar seems like it's gonna be really good.
[3670.49s -> 3671.49s]  Gonna give that one a rating.
[3673.84s -> 3675.24s]  No, that's higher than this 3.9.
[3679.19s -> 3680.39s]  The demo for Gloomwood
[3682.80s -> 3683.60s]  was a four
[3685.34s -> 3685.84s]  point.
[3692.70s -> 3693.10s]  Hold on.
[3693.40s -> 3694.10s]  Don't influence me.
[3695.30s -> 3696.10s]  Sound design.
[3696.20s -> 3696.60s]  Five.
[3698.85s -> 3699.75s]  Length of the demo.
[3700.45s -> 3700.85s]  Five.
[3702.50s -> 3703.90s]  Getting right to the point.
[3704.30s -> 3704.70s]  Five.
[3706.34s -> 3707.04s]  Just right to the point.
[3707.04s -> 3708.04s]  Hey, this is what you're doing.
[3708.04s -> 3709.54s]  Here's a little tasks.
[3709.74s -> 3710.84s]  Just go play the demo.
[3710.84s -> 3711.24s]  Five.
[3715.86s -> 3716.56s]  Scare factor.
[3717.36s -> 3717.76s]  Five.
[3717.96s -> 3719.26s]  Four point six.
[3721.23s -> 3721.93s]  Stealth game.
[3722.73s -> 3723.13s]  Three.
[3736.10s -> 3737.00s]  This is a 4.7.
[3737.80s -> 3739.70s]  This demo with not this demo was a 4.7.
[3743.78s -> 3744.28s]  No, I'm not.
[3744.28s -> 3744.68s]  Well, hold on.
[3744.68s -> 3745.28s]  Whoa.
[3745.48s -> 3750.38s]  I'm not saying that like a this is me personally give this is me personally giving you a review.
[3751.80s -> 3753.50s]  Does that mean stealth games are bad?
[3753.60s -> 3756.80s]  No, that's just how I feel about stealth games.
[3757.20s -> 3758.10s]  I'm not very good at them.
[3758.30s -> 3760.20s]  I'm very bad at them and I can't play them very well.
[3760.40s -> 3763.70s]  So for me a stealth game right off the bat is like a two.
[3763.90s -> 3764.30s]  Okay.
[3765.20s -> 3767.30s]  A stealth game is a two right off right out of the box.
[3769.46s -> 3770.26s]  This one was really good.
[3773.67s -> 3774.27s]  4.6.
[3774.27s -> 3774.67s]  Let's go.
[3777.85s -> 3778.65s]  That's a skill issue.
[3779.05s -> 3780.05s]  I look okay.
[3782.05s -> 3782.85s]  That was phenomenal.
[3785.00s -> 3785.90s]  Right out of the box.
[3786.00s -> 3788.90s]  All stealth games get like a 1.5 for me.
[3790.09s -> 3792.79s]  There's no the game could be a 10 and 10 masterpiece.
[3795.84s -> 3797.24s]  That's a 4.6 out of five.
[3799.59s -> 3800.99s]  Yeah, that was phenomenal.
[3802.48s -> 3803.48s]  Very very well done.
[3804.18s -> 3809.86s]  I loved it, but I'm terrible at stealth games and I can never play this game the way it's intended for it to be played.
[3812.01s -> 3813.41s]  But I can still enjoy it.
[3813.41s -> 3816.04s]  I think what about Metal Gear?
[3816.74s -> 3817.74s]  I feel the same way right?
[3819.26s -> 3822.46s]  You guys have any idea how many times when I was playing Metal Gear.
[3822.46s -> 3826.16s]  I heard there he is and I would just go.
[3830.29s -> 3831.19s]  No, that was fantastic.
[3831.19s -> 3833.59s]  4.6 gloom would look actually look forward.
[3833.59s -> 3839.84s]  I'm looking forward to playing it because that I mean you got a Mickey Mouse scream out of me.
[3840.04s -> 3841.54s]  It was like horror and stealth though.
[3841.64s -> 3843.48s]  So that's that was awesome.
[3843.88s -> 3845.18s]  It wasn't just a stealth game.
[3846.40s -> 3847.60s]  Don't categorize it as that.
[3851.58s -> 3856.82s]  Okay, so now I also because we queued up another one for today as well.
[3858.98s -> 3862.58s]  Trey Pang that I remember I got that one last night.
[3862.58s -> 3863.28s]  I was going to try it.
[3863.28s -> 3863.98s]  Let's try that one.
[3872.24s -> 3873.04s]  Trey Pang 2.
[3878.30s -> 3878.60s]  Okay.
[3878.60s -> 3882.73s]  Let me get the game here difficulty normal video resolution.
[3882.73s -> 3887.92s]  That's a weird resolution that I don't have 1440p.
[3887.92s -> 3892.97s]  Come on, bro 90 FOV.
[3893.47s -> 3895.17s]  No motion blur, please.
[3895.47s -> 3896.37s]  You can't see sorry.
[3906.20s -> 3909.86s]  Okay, a field of view 90 gamma.
[3911.39s -> 3912.19s]  I think that looks all right.
[3912.19s -> 3914.89s]  Wait, is this a scary game to quality preset high audio?
[3914.89s -> 3915.19s]  All right.
[3915.19s -> 3915.79s]  This is important.
[3916.09s -> 3916.79s]  How loud is it?
[3916.79s -> 3917.39s]  I can't really tell.
[3917.93s -> 3918.43s]  Is it good?
[3924.12s -> 3925.52s]  Does it mean lower a little bit higher?
[3928.53s -> 3929.43s]  I can't see over here.
[3931.48s -> 3932.38s]  Maybe like a little bit lower.
[3932.48s -> 3936.03s]  We'll take it down to like 70.
[3936.76s -> 3937.26s]  How's that?
[3940.23s -> 3940.93s]  It's doing normal.
[3947.87s -> 3953.06s]  Did that just what's going on?
[3967.86s -> 3968.86s]  It's very far.
[3969.26s -> 3971.76s]  I was like, wait, when are we going to stop and it's going to be us standing there.
[3973.18s -> 3976.08s]  Wait, trepang 2 was made by trepang.
[3976.08s -> 3978.78s]  There was a trepang one and it was made by trepang studios.
[3979.73s -> 3980.13s]  Okay.
[3980.63s -> 3981.03s]  All right.
[3981.53s -> 3981.93s]  Let's go.
[3988.72s -> 3989.42s]  So this is a sequel.
[3998.61s -> 3999.01s]  Okay.
[4019.83s -> 4021.23s]  That was that scream.
[4029.19s -> 4030.49s]  Just shoot me in the face.
[4034.80s -> 4035.50s]  Am I all right?
[4040.97s -> 4041.37s]  What do you know?
[4041.37s -> 4042.07s]  He missed.
[4042.71s -> 4043.21s]  He missed.
[4043.21s -> 4045.31s]  I he point he missed.
[4046.75s -> 4047.25s]  I missed.
[4047.25s -> 4047.65s]  All right.
[4047.75s -> 4052.94s]  I can't see fucking anything.
[4052.94s -> 4053.44s]  Hold on.
[4061.49s -> 4063.29s]  It's it's so dark.
[4065.72s -> 4066.82s]  Can everybody see anything?
[4071.42s -> 4076.15s]  Little lower this DPI on this mouse is seriously.
[4076.35s -> 4078.35s]  How would you ever have it this high?
[4081.00s -> 4082.00s]  Somebody correct me.
[4083.82s -> 4090.26s]  And is this weird to like I've never played a video game where this was ever higher than here.
[4090.76s -> 4098.98s]  Out of a hundred who how could you ever have a hundred is my mouse just fucked up?
[4099.52s -> 4100.62s]  Is it my mouse just weird?
[4103.16s -> 4108.66s]  I'm gonna say for the feels better.
[4108.66s -> 4108.96s]  All right.
[4108.96s -> 4112.02s]  So then now turn the gamma up a little is that cheating?
[4115.90s -> 4117.00s]  What about just like 10%?
[4118.94s -> 4121.16s]  I think that's okay, right?
[4123.91s -> 4125.61s]  It has to be an even number of freak out.
[4125.71s -> 4126.01s]  Okay.
[4127.49s -> 4129.79s]  Like I security is not responding.
[4131.04s -> 4131.74s]  That's the game.
[4149.77s -> 4150.77s]  What is going on?
[4154.21s -> 4154.81s]  What was that?
[4155.90s -> 4156.30s]  What happened?
[4156.30s -> 4158.60s]  Units were under attack by unknown elements.
[4158.60s -> 4161.00s]  Execute Operation Bright Star immediately.
[4177.65s -> 4178.95s]  That's something was running down the hall.
[4180.12s -> 4180.52s]  Okay.
[4180.52s -> 4181.92s]  There's something is running down the hall.
[4189.60s -> 4190.40s]  Is this stealth game?
[4196.48s -> 4210.58s]  It is still too high.
[4214.87s -> 4216.27s]  And I'm going 120.
[4216.27s -> 4217.07s]  We're going 20%.
[4218.13s -> 4220.93s]  And I need to turn this down to like two.
[4223.21s -> 4227.91s]  You know, I've been concerned playing games before where I didn't think even down at one.
[4228.51s -> 4230.21s]  It felt really bad.
[4231.05s -> 4232.25s]  And I was like, what am I supposed to do about this?
[4232.25s -> 4233.35s]  I have to like change the deep.
[4233.35s -> 4234.65s]  I have to go into the DPI settings.
[4234.65s -> 4234.95s]  All right.
[4236.23s -> 4237.13s]  Three should be fine.
[4239.37s -> 4240.17s]  Three's fine.
[4243.43s -> 4243.93s]  Yeah, that's better.
[4243.93s -> 4244.43s]  That feels good.
[4244.63s -> 4245.23s]  It feels natural.
[4248.06s -> 4250.86s]  This game looks really nice hiding the dark.
[4252.86s -> 4253.56s]  Is there a run?
[4256.60s -> 4257.20s]  I just pressed E.
[4257.20s -> 4257.60s]  What happened?
[4258.60s -> 4259.00s]  Oops.
[4262.08s -> 4262.68s]  Hey fellas.
[4264.08s -> 4265.28s]  Let me distract you for a second.
[4265.58s -> 4266.38s]  Would it work here?
[4269.41s -> 4273.01s]  You see I my car broke down on the road.
[4274.41s -> 4275.11s]  Can you believe it?
[4275.11s -> 4276.31s]  Right a mile down the road.
[4276.31s -> 4277.41s]  I had to walk a mile.
[4279.50s -> 4280.60s]  It probably just killed me.
[4283.21s -> 4284.71s]  That would be like a target sighted.
[4292.07s -> 4293.47s]  It was some kind of currency thing.
[4295.36s -> 4296.16s]  Do I have a flashlight?
[4301.34s -> 4301.64s]  What?
[4304.55s -> 4305.05s]  Who?
[4312.69s -> 4316.39s]  Yo, yo, I think I see him.
[4317.79s -> 4318.69s]  What's on the dings?
[4318.99s -> 4319.79s]  What's going on?
[4319.89s -> 4320.29s]  What?
[4320.79s -> 4321.59s]  Clown mode?
[4321.59s -> 4322.49s]  What's clown mode?
[4323.49s -> 4324.29s]  Get out of here.
[4327.72s -> 4327.92s]  What?
[4327.92s -> 4328.92s]  How do I run?
[4329.42s -> 4330.52s]  What is sprint?
[4331.02s -> 4333.62s]  How do I run?
[4334.12s -> 4334.82s]  How do you run?
[4334.82s -> 4335.82s]  Somebody tell me how you run?
[4336.02s -> 4336.62s]  How do I run?
[4336.62s -> 4337.12s]  How do I run?
[4337.12s -> 4337.72s]  How do I run?
[4338.62s -> 4339.22s]  How do I run?
[4339.22s -> 4339.82s]  How do I run?
[4355.39s -> 4356.99s]  There's nobody in the wall, man.
[4359.08s -> 4360.38s]  That guy's pretending to work.
[4365.82s -> 4366.72s]  What the fuck?
[4370.04s -> 4370.64s]  Clown mode.
[4373.14s -> 4374.14s]  I'm stuck in here.
[4374.14s -> 4375.04s]  How do I get out of here?
[4376.81s -> 4387.38s]  Is there a jump throwing flares in here?
[4387.38s -> 4388.28s]  How do I get out of here?
[4388.68s -> 4389.48s]  Oh, wait, I see.
[4397.40s -> 4399.90s]  You can't get me up if I save area here.
[4402.92s -> 4408.12s]  Who would win a hundred guys with machine guns or a walking
[4408.12s -> 4408.82s]  clown?
[4420.15s -> 4421.15s]  How do I run?
[4423.51s -> 4424.51s]  I like this game.
[4424.81s -> 4427.61s]  This I think this game's got serious potential.
[4428.31s -> 4430.91s]  And I mean it dead serious potential.
[4446.69s -> 4447.09s]  Oh my God.
[4447.09s -> 4447.59s]  There's a gun.
[4459.27s -> 4460.17s]  Is there aim down sights?
[4461.10s -> 4461.50s]  Nope.
[4461.50s -> 4462.30s]  It's okay.
[4462.30s -> 4462.70s]  All right.
[4462.70s -> 4463.90s]  It's kind of like Counter-Strike mode.
[4466.29s -> 4466.99s]  Oh my God.
[4467.09s -> 4468.09s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[4476.26s -> 4477.96s]  Okay, let's go.
[4480.56s -> 4481.36s]  Should I go across?
[4481.56s -> 4482.16s]  Wait, what's in here?
[4482.16s -> 4482.76s]  Might be ammo.
[4483.26s -> 4484.06s]  Is there flashlight?
[4487.49s -> 4488.29s]  No, can't get in there.
[4489.30s -> 4489.80s]  There we go.
[4489.80s -> 4490.50s]  There's the sprint.
[4491.00s -> 4498.24s]  Go to we lost contact 106 stay sharp jump and melee to do.
[4498.24s -> 4498.94s]  Oh my God.
[4498.94s -> 4499.44s]  There's a kick.

[4656.88s -> 4657.38s]  What is that?
[4677.64s -> 4678.94s]  We can't even hit each other.
[4679.74s -> 4681.24s]  What a bunch of fucking idiots.
[4687.13s -> 4687.63s]  The gun.

[4792.04s -> 4793.54s]  This is like an ammo crate or something.
[4793.84s -> 4794.24s]  No.
[4797.22s -> 4798.42s]  Oh, yeah, I'll take it.
[4799.50s -> 4801.20s]  I love shotguns like my favorite in every game.

[4898.53s -> 4899.13s]  Okay.
[4910.79s -> 4911.49s]  Where should I go?
[4924.56s -> 4926.76s]  Violent violence, Andy.
[4938.26s -> 4939.16s]  Jesus.
[4940.28s -> 4941.28s]  What the fuck happened here?
[4947.90s -> 4949.00s]  Oh my fucking God.
[4949.50s -> 4949.90s]  Wait, I didn't.
[4949.90s -> 4950.60s]  Did I do this?
[4951.54s -> 4952.34s]  This is me.
[4952.34s -> 4952.64s]  Wait.

[4975.58s -> 4977.08s]  He's in a time paradox.
[4985.13s -> 4989.32s]  Coin holding the coin like this get you killed.
[4992.87s -> 4993.57s]  Can I have a sword?
[4997.56s -> 4998.36s]  Can I have the sword?
[4999.20s -> 5000.30s]  Sword looks pretty cool.
[5001.93s -> 5002.53s]  I don't think so.
[5028.88s -> 5029.78s]  There's nobody here.
[5030.08s -> 5030.48s]  What?
[5036.93s -> 5037.53s]  Don't move.
[5038.33s -> 5039.23s]  Don't move.
[5040.70s -> 5042.00s]  Don't you dare move.
[5047.60s -> 5048.00s]  Hey.
[5048.70s -> 5049.10s]  Don't.
[5050.20s -> 5052.30s]  I see what you're trying to do, but it's not going to work.
[5052.30s -> 5053.50s]  You're not going to get a good line on me.
[5053.50s -> 5054.00s]  I tell you.
[5056.17s -> 5056.57s]  Hey.
[5058.24s -> 5058.74s]  Hey.

[5089.44s -> 5090.54s]  No, I wanted to grab him.
[5095.62s -> 5096.22s]  Stop.
[5097.08s -> 5099.35s]  Oh, I need more shotgun stuff.
[5106.74s -> 5107.14s]  Locked.
[5107.14s -> 5107.44s]  Okay.
[5111.79s -> 5112.69s]  I love the flares.
[5117.41s -> 5117.71s]  I'm not.
[5119.97s -> 5120.87s]  Actually, this is probably better.
[5121.47s -> 5121.77s]  Yeah.
[5129.15s -> 5129.45s]  Okay.
[5129.65s -> 5130.45s]  Well, that's does that.

[5158.08s -> 5160.90s]  The inside of my ear is itching.
[5161.10s -> 5162.90s]  Does that mean that somebody like sneezed?
[5163.67s -> 5164.17s]  What does that mean?
[5164.17s -> 5165.07s]  That means something right?
[5172.90s -> 5173.70s]  What the hell was that?
[5173.70s -> 5174.70s]  Was that little shimmy?
[5183.82s -> 5186.32s]  No, it's if somebody sneezes that means they're talking.
[5186.42s -> 5188.22s]  No, if you sneeze means somebody's talking about you.
[5188.76s -> 5189.36s]  That's what it is.
[5200.94s -> 5202.14s]  Was that a huge kick?
[5202.64s -> 5203.64s]  What the fuck was that?
[5204.94s -> 5206.34s]  What just happened to that guy?
[5207.24s -> 5208.14s]  Oh my God.

[5253.58s -> 5254.38s]  Who's alive?
[5256.44s -> 5257.24s]  Is it what?
[5267.24s -> 5269.64s]  I put a grenade on him and threw him back in the elevator.
[5270.58s -> 5270.88s]  All right.
[5270.88s -> 5271.18s]  We're good.
[5271.18s -> 5271.38s]  We're good.
[5271.38s -> 5271.68s]  We're good.
[5271.68s -> 5271.98s]  I got it.
[5271.98s -> 5272.18s]  I got it.
[5272.18s -> 5272.48s]  I got it.
[5289.89s -> 5290.79s]  This gun sucks.
[5304.06s -> 5304.56s]  I love it.
[5304.76s -> 5305.36s]  I love it.
[5305.66s -> 5307.66s]  I'm just having too much fun being like an idiot.
[5322.46s -> 5322.96s]  Open, open, open.
[5322.96s -> 5324.36s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[5325.96s -> 5326.26s]  No.
[5337.26s -> 5337.36s]  All right.
[5337.36s -> 5337.86s]  Give me up.

[5382.65s -> 5383.15s]  We're good.
[5391.75s -> 5392.95s]  That was insane.
[5394.35s -> 5395.05s]  Oh, grenades.
[5395.78s -> 5396.18s]  Where are they?
[5396.48s -> 5396.78s]  In here?
[5401.94s -> 5402.84s]  All right, G is grenade.
[5405.96s -> 5406.66s]  Health, got it.
[5412.86s -> 5413.76s]  Silencers.
[5416.42s -> 5418.68s]  Where is there a silencer?
[5418.78s -> 5419.38s]  Where's the silencer?
[5419.38s -> 5419.78s]  Where is it?
[5419.78s -> 5420.28s]  Where is it?
[5420.78s -> 5421.58s]  It just popped up on the screen.
[5421.58s -> 5422.28s]  Where's the silencer?
[5453.92s -> 5454.52s]  Oh, fuck.
[5455.71s -> 5459.11s]  Well, the game's physics just make a shitload of noise.
[5460.29s -> 5461.69s]  The game's physics makes a ton of noise.
[5461.69s -> 5462.69s]  What am I supposed to do about that?
[5484.67s -> 5484.97s]  Okay.
[5487.21s -> 5487.61s]  What?
[5487.61s -> 5488.61s]  There's another person here.
[5494.96s -> 5495.86s]  Get out, get out, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[5495.86s -> 5496.56s]  Don't come near me.
[5508.89s -> 5510.59s]  You gotta shoot me in the shoes, man.
[5510.59s -> 5512.49s]  Why are you shooting right into the shield?
[5514.81s -> 5515.51s]  No ammo.
[5527.74s -> 5528.34s]  Oh, come on.
[5528.34s -> 5528.74s]  I don't.
[5533.13s -> 5533.43s]  Shoot him.
[5534.82s -> 5535.22s]  Why can't I?
[5535.42s -> 5535.92s]  What's going on?
[5536.52s -> 5536.92s]  That was weird.
[5563.84s -> 5564.24s]  We're here?
[5565.34s -> 5565.94s]  No, it's locked.
[5565.94s -> 5566.14s]  Shit.
[5566.14s -> 5566.64s]  Where did I go?
[5566.84s -> 5571.84s]  What the hell is that?
[5574.40s -> 5575.50s]  Do you remember you're killing them?
[5577.60s -> 5578.10s]  Yeah.
[5578.90s -> 5582.46s]  I'm playing a game where I'm there.
[5582.76s -> 5585.36s]  They're coming in with us with machine guns to try to get me.
[5586.93s -> 5587.43s]  I'm like it.
[5587.83s -> 5589.43s]  I'm this is I'm like an SCP.
[5589.43s -> 5590.33s]  I don't know what's going on.

[5620.82s -> 5621.22s]  What?
[5634.22s -> 5634.72s]  Did I get him?
[5640.71s -> 5641.71s]  Oh my goodness.
[5641.71s -> 5642.81s]  Customize weapon.
[5647.08s -> 5648.28s]  Laser and a suppressor.

[5648.78s -> 5649.28s]  Yeah, cool.
[5653.42s -> 5654.62s]  Can I customize this laser?
[5659.30s -> 5659.60s]  Laser.
[5659.60s -> 5665.56s]  Yeah, the game is so loud.
[5666.23s -> 5667.33s]  I thought you guys told me it was good.
[5669.52s -> 5670.72s]  I thought you guys told me it was good.
[5671.12s -> 5672.52s]  It's been this loud the whole time.
[5706.70s -> 5707.20s]  Wow.
[5718.10s -> 5719.50s]  Whoa, what the hell was that?
[5724.77s -> 5726.27s]  Whoa, don't walk into that.
[5730.63s -> 5731.33s]  Oh my God.
[5731.53s -> 5732.63s]  Don't don't don't don't don't don't.
[5732.63s -> 5733.13s]  What are you doing?
[5733.13s -> 5733.63s]  Don't throw that.
[5733.63s -> 5734.53s]  It's gonna blow the whole thing up.
[5735.23s -> 5735.93s]  Thanks, actually.
[5746.42s -> 5747.42s]  Oh shit.
[5761.73s -> 5762.83s]  I have three bullets.
[5767.76s -> 5768.26s]  This looks.
[5777.89s -> 5778.39s]  What do you know?
[5782.60s -> 5788.05s]  See you later guys.
[5795.10s -> 5796.40s]  Zero one respond.
[5797.50s -> 5798.80s]  Son of a bitch.
[5800.70s -> 5801.70s]  They're gonna come from this way.
[5801.80s -> 5803.80s]  Don't don't say move in.
[5803.80s -> 5805.20s]  I know they're gonna go on the elevator.
[5805.80s -> 5806.50s]  You're making this wheel.
[5806.50s -> 5807.40s]  They're making this too easy.
[5810.77s -> 5813.37s]  Zero two move in from the second elevator.
[5813.37s -> 5815.87s]  Sierra three move in from the third elevator.
[5844.91s -> 5845.51s]  Oh my God.
[5845.51s -> 5846.21s]  That guy's probably.
[5863.82s -> 5864.72s]  He's trapped.
[5871.88s -> 5872.78s]  I'm trying to get him out.
[5874.49s -> 5875.69s]  Holy shit.
[5875.89s -> 5877.19s]  Oh my God.
[5877.19s -> 5877.59s]  No.
[5882.60s -> 5883.00s]  He's.
[5884.20s -> 5885.10s]  I don't think he's alive.
[5885.60s -> 5886.70s]  I don't think he's alive anymore.
[5888.82s -> 5889.02s]  What?
[5889.02s -> 5890.52s]  Another Sierra team?
[5892.13s -> 5892.53s]  Where?
[5892.83s -> 5901.14s]  Oh, I'm invisible.
[5901.14s -> 5902.14s]  You can't see me stupid.
[5919.85s -> 5920.15s]  You.
[5928.45s -> 5928.85s]  What?
[5933.59s -> 5934.79s]  Oh my God.
[5946.12s -> 5946.52s]  Okay.
[5972.25s -> 5973.45s]  God, there's a lot of fire.
[5992.69s -> 5994.59s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[5994.59s -> 5995.49s]  This is a gug of the game.
[6008.70s -> 6009.10s]  All right.
[6009.70s -> 6011.00s]  He's gonna come in on his own, right?
[6021.34s -> 6021.64s]  Yep.
[6023.30s -> 6023.60s]  Okay.
[6031.29s -> 6031.69s]  Is he?
[6042.05s -> 6043.05s]  Oh, the baby's close.
[6051.99s -> 6053.59s]  This guy looks like he got a bug on the character.
[6055.08s -> 6055.78s]  What was that?
[6056.08s -> 6056.68s]  What happened?
[6070.96s -> 6071.76s]  Is he on me?
[6073.18s -> 6074.18s]  Why is he attached to me?
[6074.18s -> 6074.88s]  Get him off me.
[6103.20s -> 6104.70s]  What the fuck, dude?
[6104.70s -> 6105.60s]  What the hell?
[6106.30s -> 6107.90s]  No, I didn't like that.
[6108.40s -> 6109.40s]  I didn't like that.
[6109.40s -> 6110.30s]  It was horrible.
[6111.00s -> 6112.00s]  That was fucked.
[6114.67s -> 6115.77s]  Are they stopping me?
[6118.35s -> 6119.45s]  Wait, these are bad guys?
[6123.10s -> 6123.50s]  What?
[6125.53s -> 6126.43s]  What happened?
[6126.63s -> 6127.43s]  What's going on?
[6127.43s -> 6128.43s]  What's going on?
[6128.93s -> 6130.63s]  Wait, these are, I thought these are the enemies.
[6130.83s -> 6131.93s]  These are friendlies?
[6131.93s -> 6132.33s]  How?
[6133.13s -> 6134.23s]  These guys are what?
[6140.14s -> 6142.74s]  We're gonna, we're gonna get you out of here, man.
[6147.39s -> 6149.29s]  I was like, why are they not shooting at me?
[6149.29s -> 6150.19s]  It was weird.
[6154.27s -> 6154.97s]  I need to know.
[6155.27s -> 6156.17s]  I need to know.
[6156.87s -> 6157.67s]  I need to know.
[6161.57s -> 6162.47s]  I have to know.
[6162.57s -> 6164.07s]  Okay, I'm not leaving you until I know.
[6175.20s -> 6176.60s]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[6176.60s -> 6177.50s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[6177.50s -> 6178.40s]  I really didn't.
[6182.48s -> 6185.78s]  I've been shooting at these guys in this armor the whole time.
[6187.92s -> 6190.02s]  I didn't know that I was being rescued.
[6190.02s -> 6192.62s]  I just see guys pointing guns at me and I was like, oh, there,
[6192.72s -> 6193.42s]  there he is.
[6199.19s -> 6200.79s]  That was insane.
[6200.79s -> 6201.69s]  Holy shit.
[6201.69s -> 6202.29s]  That's a five.
[6212.60s -> 6214.00s]  That's absolutely a five.
[6218.33s -> 6218.93s]  Wow.
[6224.08s -> 6224.98s]  When does this come out?
[6233.82s -> 6234.62s]  There's more?
[6237.07s -> 6237.87s]  It's not over.
[6238.07s -> 6238.57s]  Really?
[6238.57s -> 6239.17s]  Are you serious?
[6246.85s -> 6247.75s]  It's coming out this year?
[6247.75s -> 6248.45s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[6253.08s -> 6253.78s]  Oh my God.
[6253.98s -> 6255.88s]  Pleasure to finally meet you 106.
[6256.84s -> 6260.14s]  The Horizon Corporation had you locked away for a very long time.
[6261.46s -> 6262.56s]  They must be frightened.
[6262.56s -> 6263.56s]  Now that you're free.
[6264.26s -> 6265.56s]  Customized appearance.
[6266.36s -> 6267.06s]  So do we.
[6267.76s -> 6269.06s]  Who's what's going on?
[6269.36s -> 6271.06s]  Welcome to Task Force 27.
[6271.26s -> 6272.06s]  Oh, it's me shooting.
[6287.69s -> 6288.49s]  So what I do here.
[6303.70s -> 6304.90s]  Oh, we select missions.
[6305.20s -> 6305.90s]  It's kind of like a hub.
[6311.76s -> 6313.36s]  That was just pure.
[6314.10s -> 6315.20s]  That was just adrenaline.
[6317.51s -> 6319.91s]  I'm starting to understand the kinds of games that I really like.
[6320.41s -> 6329.96s]  It's just like the go go go go go go go go go go do not kill.
[6329.96s -> 6332.36s]  I'm not going to I know now that I'm not I'm not going to shoot anybody.
[6332.36s -> 6332.76s]  Don't worry.
[6334.07s -> 6335.47s]  We have a mission ready for you.
[6335.87s -> 6339.27s]  A raid on a Horizon facility similar to the one you escaped from.
[6340.28s -> 6343.48s]  When you're ready head to the briefing room and we can get started.
[6346.65s -> 6347.15s]  Intel.
[6347.85s -> 6348.35s]  Okay.
[6349.71s -> 6352.21s]  Well, they better be Intel in that computer.
[6356.33s -> 6366.19s]  You know I'm saying prologue and okay complex.
[6371.87s -> 6373.77s]  Pack in and download the encrypted data.
[6377.04s -> 6377.44s]  It's normal.
[6377.44s -> 6378.04s]  Normal is fun.
[6383.32s -> 6384.12s]  Did I do it?
[6384.22s -> 6384.82s]  Do I have to leave?
[6386.98s -> 6387.78s]  Launch mission.
[6391.02s -> 6392.12s]  Oh, I have to get on the helicopter.
[6392.12s -> 6392.32s]  Okay.
[6395.52s -> 6396.12s]  What is this?
[6400.68s -> 6402.51s]  No, no, no.
[6402.71s -> 6403.91s]  Oh, serum.
[6404.11s -> 6404.51s]  Of course.
[6413.03s -> 6414.73s]  That was a dual welding serum.
[6415.73s -> 6416.33s]  It's kind of weird.
[6420.92s -> 6443.01s]  Oh, oh, can you open the door for me?
[6445.04s -> 6445.54s]  I'll get it.
[6454.50s -> 6456.40s]  Customize change your clothes.
[6456.70s -> 6457.60s]  I don't care.
[6458.30s -> 6459.20s]  I don't need to change clothes.
[6459.60s -> 6460.10s]  I think I'm good.
[6464.72s -> 6466.32s]  BF bugleberry serum.
[6472.00s -> 6472.70s]  I didn't do that.
[6472.70s -> 6473.70s]  Don't blame that on me.
[6474.61s -> 6475.81s]  That was poor placement.
[6477.03s -> 6480.13s]  Okay, so I have to sneak in here and hack the mainframe.
[6483.25s -> 6484.45s]  Clean up how much?
[6484.65s -> 6485.45s]  Okay, clean up.
[6485.95s -> 6486.45s]  Armor.
[6491.52s -> 6492.02s]  Oops.
[6492.62s -> 6493.62s]  What is clean up?
[6498.81s -> 6500.11s]  Access denied.
[6502.26s -> 6503.26s]  Do I need to keep doing that?
[6504.17s -> 6505.57s]  All right proximity hack.
[6509.53s -> 6511.53s]  I'm hacking a coke machine.
[6511.63s -> 6511.93s]  Oh.
[6517.63s -> 6518.13s]  What?
[6518.53s -> 6522.03s]  What's going on?
[6522.13s -> 6523.13s]  Wait, this is a setup.
[6523.13s -> 6523.83s]  They were waiting for me.
[6525.27s -> 6525.97s]  They were waiting for me.
[6525.97s -> 6527.07s]  This is a setup.
[6534.26s -> 6534.96s]  I couldn't find the gun.
[6537.68s -> 6538.28s]  Dual welding.
[6538.58s -> 6570.52s]  Dual welding.
[6573.08s -> 6573.88s]  So it's just okay.
[6573.88s -> 6574.68s]  It's like a wave.
[6575.38s -> 6593.34s]  Can I do it?
[6606.42s -> 6606.82s]  Hey, stop.
[6606.92s -> 6607.92s]  Stop anti hacking me.
[6612.10s -> 6612.70s]  Get out of here.
[6620.94s -> 6622.04s]  Get out of here with that Norton.
[6653.43s -> 6654.43s]  I was shooting at this friend.
[6660.83s -> 6661.23s]  What?
[6661.23s -> 6661.63s]  Oh my God.
[6661.63s -> 6662.23s]  He's alive.
[6662.83s -> 6663.43s]  He's alive.
[6664.23s -> 6664.63s]  No, he's not.
[6664.73s -> 6665.33s]  Never mind.
[6666.53s -> 6667.03s]  No, he's not.
[6667.53s -> 6668.03s]  Never mind.
[6684.90s -> 6685.50s]  Oh, it's done.
[6685.50s -> 6685.70s]  All right.
[6685.70s -> 6686.20s]  Now what?
[6686.94s -> 6687.84s]  Wave two.
[6689.39s -> 6690.29s]  Oh my God.
[6691.09s -> 6691.89s]  How long does this last?
[6691.89s -> 6692.19s]  I don't...
[6697.04s -> 6697.44s]  I want the...
[6697.94s -> 6698.44s]  Okay, over here.
[6722.26s -> 6725.06s]  Where'd he get this fucking Ghostbusters proton pack out of here?
[6734.50s -> 6734.90s]  What?
[6735.00s -> 6735.80s]  Where was that guy?
[6736.80s -> 6737.40s]  Where'd he go?
[6740.58s -> 6741.58s]  Where did that guy go?
[6742.28s -> 6755.51s]  He jumped over me.
[6755.51s -> 6756.01s]  Oh shit.
[6786.68s -> 6802.14s]  My God.
[6808.00s -> 6808.80s]  The hell is that?
[6808.90s -> 6809.50s]  Oh my God.
[6809.50s -> 6810.00s]  What is he doing?
[6810.40s -> 6810.90s]  Stop.
[6816.33s -> 6816.73s]  Stop.
[6816.93s -> 6817.43s]  Stop.
[6818.13s -> 6819.63s]  There's literally no need for any of this.
[6819.63s -> 6820.03s]  Stop.
[6823.38s -> 6823.88s]  Stop.
[6824.58s -> 6825.38s]  Just stop.
[6825.38s -> 6825.98s]  Stop.
[6826.08s -> 6826.48s]  Enough.
[6827.18s -> 6827.68s]  Enough.
[6837.96s -> 6839.06s]  Okay, you still want...
[6843.55s -> 6844.25s]  I gotta clean up.
[6847.87s -> 6849.17s]  Wait, I can get in my own squad?
[6869.57s -> 6869.97s]  Oh my God.
[6869.97s -> 6870.97s]  They were just guarding it.
[6874.24s -> 6875.14s]  Oh shit.
[6875.54s -> 6876.44s]  I think I'm done here.
[6881.50s -> 6882.00s]  What is it?
[6882.00s -> 6882.60s]  2500?
[6892.50s -> 6893.50s]  Oh my God.
[6893.50s -> 6894.60s]  They're just collapsing here.
[6894.90s -> 6905.15s]  All right, that one's done.
[6913.39s -> 6914.39s]  Where's the last one?
[6918.14s -> 6919.34s]  Ow, my ears.
[6928.75s -> 6929.55s]  Can I pick that up?
[6933.46s -> 6934.56s]  I just want to see what the squad looks like.
[6934.56s -> 6935.16s]  And then I'm out of here.
[6955.68s -> 6956.38s]  Okay, 25 right now.
[6956.38s -> 6956.98s]  Let's get the squad.
[6958.97s -> 6959.87s]  All right, squad time.
[6968.45s -> 6969.95s]  Where's the supply thing?
[6970.88s -> 6971.68s]  Where's the supply thing?
[6978.12s -> 6979.12s]  Where's the supply thing?
[6979.12s -> 6983.54s]  They're just throwing grenades.
[6986.02s -> 6987.12s]  All right, squad incoming.
[6988.22s -> 6988.72s]  Where are they?
[6989.82s -> 6990.32s]  Oh my God.
[6990.32s -> 6991.42s]  That's a lot of people.
[6991.52s -> 6993.42s]  That's a huge amount of people.
[6994.72s -> 6996.12s]  Oh my God.
[7001.15s -> 7001.85s]  Be careful.
[7002.25s -> 7003.05s]  Be careful.
[7003.65s -> 7018.21s]  All right, move in, move in, move in.
[7029.84s -> 7030.34s]  What?
[7031.86s -> 7032.86s]  Grenade!
[7033.46s -> 7035.87s]  What?
[7037.73s -> 7039.03s]  I'm so confused.
[7042.60s -> 7043.50s]  Get in there, get in there, get in there.
[7043.50s -> 7044.50s]  There's somebody shooting me over here.
[7053.44s -> 7055.04s]  Okay, I think they were, I think they moved in this way.
[7058.79s -> 7060.79s]  The source of the interference is right here.
[7061.96s -> 7063.96s]  It's you, you motherfucker.
[7066.02s -> 7068.21s]  All right, move in.
[7071.20s -> 7071.70s]  Are you up?
[7072.20s -> 7073.10s]  I didn't know if you were on my team.
[7080.09s -> 7080.89s]  All right, let's move in.
[7086.60s -> 7087.80s]  Wave five incoming.
[7088.91s -> 7090.91s]  All right, I'm too stimulated.
[7090.91s -> 7091.71s]  I can't do it anymore.
[7095.90s -> 7097.30s]  All right, I'm too, I'm overstimulated.
[7097.30s -> 7097.90s]  I gotta get out of here.
[7099.47s -> 7100.57s]  I'm over, I'm way too stimulated.
[7100.57s -> 7101.07s]  I gotta go.
[7108.47s -> 7109.37s]  Did I get on my team?
[7109.37s -> 7110.57s]  Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[7111.07s -> 7111.97s]  I didn't mean to.
[7117.73s -> 7118.93s]  Who are you shooting at?
[7119.33s -> 7120.53s]  There's no one even here.
[7121.57s -> 7122.17s]  Who are you?
[7125.16s -> 7127.06s]  If this is just chaos, I don't even know who's who.
[7135.39s -> 7136.59s]  All right, just kill me, just kill me.
[7136.59s -> 7137.79s]  I want to get out of this.
[7145.70s -> 7147.30s]  No, I don't want to resume the cycle.
[7147.30s -> 7149.00s]  I want to, don't want to get out of here.
[7155.08s -> 7155.88s]  That was insane.
[7155.88s -> 7156.68s]  This game is crazy.
[7158.16s -> 7159.36s]  Oh, are you playing Call of Duty?
[7159.36s -> 7160.66s]  It's not, I mean that, not Call of Duty.
[7162.39s -> 7163.29s]  Okay, let's keep going.
[7165.83s -> 7167.33s]  That was Trey Pang 2.
[7169.46s -> 7171.66s]  Were there any more that I downloaded that last night?
[7171.66s -> 7172.36s]  I'm trying to remember.
[7173.64s -> 7175.34s]  Did I, do I have any more of that from yesterday?
[7176.38s -> 7177.18s]  I think there was one.
[7181.34s -> 7182.34s]  There was one that we were looking at.
[7185.72s -> 7187.02s]  Which one was it though?
[7191.22s -> 7192.92s]  Because I'm up in the top here.
[7194.54s -> 7198.84s]  If you take a look, this is the, so I'm on the action tab right now.
[7201.18s -> 7202.38s]  This is action adventure.
[7204.98s -> 7205.88s]  Some of these look kind of cool.
[7207.20s -> 7207.80s]  Turtles.
[7208.64s -> 7209.34s]  What's turtles?
[7211.52s -> 7212.42s]  Casual, cute.
[7213.20s -> 7213.80s]  Should I do it?
[7215.82s -> 7216.92s]  Turtles looks pretty fun.
[7218.97s -> 7219.87s]  Action shooter.
[7221.20s -> 7222.10s]  Beat him up in D.
[7224.12s -> 7225.02s]  This one looks good too.
[7227.21s -> 7228.61s]  Gnome online.
[7230.34s -> 7231.94s]  Play turtles over going to leave.
[7232.78s -> 7233.58s]  I'll play turtles.
[7233.58s -> 7233.98s]  Let's do it.
[7233.98s -> 7234.28s]  All right.
[7234.28s -> 7234.78s]  I'll get turtles.
[7234.78s -> 7235.18s]  Let's do it.
[7236.81s -> 7239.31s]  The stream is going to F for five seconds while I do this.
[7239.71s -> 7241.86s]  Just to let you know.
[7251.14s -> 7251.74s]  Okay.
[7252.74s -> 7254.14s]  And let's open it.
[7259.96s -> 7260.96s]  Turtles demo.
[7265.99s -> 7266.69s]  Let's check this one.
[7270.09s -> 7272.69s]  So this is a prototype temporary assets.
[7273.09s -> 7286.02s]  Okay.
[7286.32s -> 7290.72s]  Turtles.
[7293.46s -> 7294.16s]  Let's just do it.
[7295.49s -> 7296.39s]  World one.
[7302.38s -> 7305.08s]  So these globes need to turn into turtles.
[7310.28s -> 7311.28s]  What is this?
[7328.14s -> 7328.54s]  Okay.
[7330.62s -> 7331.52s]  That was really loud.
[7333.44s -> 7334.54s]  Did I just pick these up?
[7335.14s -> 7335.74s]  Oh shit.
[7335.74s -> 7336.44s]  I'm messing this up.
[7342.02s -> 7356.90s]  Oh, I don't get stuck.
[7367.36s -> 7369.46s]  I like this is I didn't lose to a kid's game.
[7369.46s -> 7370.96s]  I'm still in literally first place.
[7378.35s -> 7380.05s]  Oh lost to a kid's game literally in first place.
[7388.88s -> 7389.38s]  Shit.
[7393.41s -> 7394.91s]  It's kind of like snake in a way.
[7404.61s -> 7405.31s]  I got everybody.
[7409.55s -> 7410.25s]  That's it, right?
[7412.75s -> 7414.35s]  I got literally every single person.
[7415.38s -> 7416.08s]  That was cute.
[7418.95s -> 7420.75s]  That was that I was really cute.
[7420.75s -> 7421.55s]  What was wrong with this?
[7425.05s -> 7425.45s]  That was it.
[7425.45s -> 7426.05s]  I like that.
[7426.05s -> 7426.85s]  That was really cute.
[7431.92s -> 7432.32s]  Okay.
[7435.82s -> 7436.62s]  Three stars, right?
[7436.72s -> 7437.12s]  Yep.
[7442.56s -> 7445.26s]  Okay, don't go in don't go down the hole because you'll lose
[7445.26s -> 7446.16s]  him if you go in the hole.
[7446.26s -> 7446.56s]  All right.
[7446.56s -> 7447.06s]  I get it.
[7448.62s -> 7449.52s]  There's a lot of holes.
[7458.28s -> 7458.98s]  New meta.
[7465.74s -> 7465.94s]  All right.
[7465.94s -> 7469.04s]  So I got to go up grab this one over here.
[7469.54s -> 7470.04s]  What just happened?
[7470.04s -> 7470.34s]  What?
[7471.84s -> 7473.74s]  Oh, I held it down too long.
[7475.24s -> 7481.64s]  Okay, be careful.
[7482.24s -> 7484.80s]  Let's go.
[7490.66s -> 7503.10s]  Okay, I gotta get them all down.
[7503.80s -> 7506.08s]  Pretty good, right?
[7506.68s -> 7513.98s]  Okay.
[7513.98s -> 7515.88s]  Now I'm going to have to spread them out a little.
[7516.48s -> 7519.04s]  Oops.
[7529.40s -> 7529.60s]  All right.
[7529.60s -> 7530.50s]  Get everybody into the wall.
[7537.94s -> 7538.74s]  Is that blocked?
[7538.74s -> 7539.74s]  Does the seashell block?
[7539.74s -> 7540.14s]  Nope.
[7550.06s -> 7556.40s]  Oh shit.
[7556.40s -> 7556.90s]  Hold on.
[7559.00s -> 7560.10s]  Oh fuck.
[7560.10s -> 7560.70s]  Oh my God.
[7560.70s -> 7561.40s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[7561.40s -> 7561.80s]  Whatever.
[7570.59s -> 7570.99s]  Just again.
[7570.99s -> 7571.49s]  I'm done.
[7571.59s -> 7571.99s]  I'm done.
[7571.99s -> 7572.39s]  I'm done.
[7573.39s -> 7574.29s]  I blew it so bad.
[7575.09s -> 7576.09s]  I blew it really bad.
[7577.61s -> 7578.81s]  I just like kind of went too.
[7578.91s -> 7579.31s]  All right.
[7580.98s -> 7581.68s]  Maybe one star.
[7586.92s -> 7587.32s]  Two stars.
[7587.32s -> 7587.72s]  All right.
[7592.14s -> 7592.44s]  Next.
[7592.44s -> 7593.14s]  No, not yet.
[7594.04s -> 7595.54s]  So be careful of the birds.
[7596.68s -> 7597.48s]  The birds will eat me.
[7615.00s -> 7615.80s]  Oh, I get it.
[7615.80s -> 7620.10s]  Okay, so you just can't be in that spot when the seagull comes.
[7621.40s -> 7622.10s]  Sounds easy enough.
[7626.22s -> 7627.42s]  I hope it's just that one spot.
[7644.67s -> 7645.67s]  How do I get away from it?
[7645.67s -> 7646.17s]  How do I do this?
[7651.90s -> 7652.50s]  I can't do it.
[7677.00s -> 7677.50s]  No.
[7678.60s -> 7679.00s]  I'm good.
[7692.92s -> 7693.62s]  Did I miss an egg?
[7695.92s -> 7696.12s]  Nope.
[7696.12s -> 7696.52s]  We're good.
[7704.85s -> 7705.65s]  Go back down this way.
[7708.81s -> 7709.71s]  Is there a time limit?
[7710.11s -> 7711.11s]  Why is the music getting faster?
[7711.71s -> 7712.51s]  Sounds like a time limit.
[7727.24s -> 7728.24s]  How am I going to get them up there?
[7728.24s -> 7728.64s]  What?
[7730.50s -> 7732.00s]  I have to do it like one by one.
[7733.89s -> 7734.39s]  Wait, I got it.
[7734.39s -> 7734.89s]  I got an idea.
[7739.71s -> 7741.81s]  Oh, no.
[7742.61s -> 7743.31s]  Oh my God.
[7743.31s -> 7743.71s]  Forget it.
[7743.71s -> 7744.11s]  Whatever.
[7776.32s -> 7777.32s]  This game is fun, actually.
[7777.32s -> 7777.62s]  I like it.
[7781.82s -> 7782.72s]  I don't have very many complaints.
[7783.73s -> 7784.03s]  What?
[7785.60s -> 7786.70s]  I don't have very many complaints.
[7790.49s -> 7791.19s]  I really don't.
[7802.49s -> 7804.89s]  I mean, is it a kind of a simple little puzzle game?
[7804.89s -> 7805.29s]  Sure.
[7805.29s -> 7810.05s]  But can you find something to complain about?
[7811.88s -> 7813.48s]  No, fuck this game, man.
[7813.48s -> 7818.98s]  It's super cute and really easy to understand and challenging
[7818.98s -> 7820.88s]  and really just kind of fun.
[7820.88s -> 7825.13s]  And where's the blood, man?
[7825.33s -> 7825.83s]  Where's the blood?
[7825.83s -> 7826.93s]  How come you're not shooting anyone?
[7829.77s -> 7830.87s]  What's there something to complain about?
[7830.87s -> 7831.47s]  I want to hear it.
[7833.47s -> 7833.77s]  No, man.
[7833.77s -> 7835.47s]  The games are cute and like fun.
[7835.47s -> 7839.17s]  And it's like really looks like really anybody can enjoy it.
[7839.77s -> 7841.27s]  Dude, anybody can enjoy this.
[7842.27s -> 7849.30s]  Dad, tell that to the potion game.
[7851.45s -> 7853.95s]  That's unfair because the potion get this game is pick up
[7853.95s -> 7854.75s]  and play the potion.
[7854.75s -> 7855.75s]  It was a big story.
[7861.66s -> 7873.40s]  Oops, and the potion game was really cute.
[7873.40s -> 7875.70s]  What would you what would you complain about the potion game?
[7875.70s -> 7876.60s]  Pushing it was fine, too.
[7877.10s -> 7879.00s]  I give that like a I get that like a three eight.
[7886.92s -> 7887.22s]  What?
[7887.22s -> 7888.12s]  Oh, come on.
[7888.32s -> 7904.28s]  I mean for the fact that a lot of people say and I'll move on
[7904.28s -> 7908.68s]  a lot of you seem to be really, really connecting and really upset
[7908.68s -> 7910.18s]  when one of the turtles gets grabbed.
[7911.68s -> 7913.48s]  But you didn't care about this game.
[7913.48s -> 7914.98s]  I thought this was like a kid's game.
[7914.98s -> 7915.68s]  I don't care.
[7917.28s -> 7917.78s]  You do though.
[7920.21s -> 7921.71s]  You're rooting for these turtles.
[7921.71s -> 7923.71s]  You want them to succeed just like we all do.
[7926.62s -> 7927.72s]  See that move right there.
[7942.20s -> 7944.20s]  Guys, not every game has to have swears in it.
[7945.70s -> 7947.30s]  Not every game has to have swear words.
[7959.57s -> 7963.37s]  Oops, right when you hatched right when you hatched.
[7968.16s -> 7976.96s]  What I think I need to thin them out.
[7977.26s -> 7978.46s]  I don't think I can get up there all the way.
[7981.14s -> 7982.54s]  The seagull mechanic is really cool.
[7982.54s -> 7985.34s]  You know why because you can't just sit here and think it
[7985.34s -> 7986.34s]  makes you have to move.
[7987.38s -> 7989.98s]  I would call that that's a that's a brilliant game design
[7989.98s -> 7990.38s]  choice.
[7991.08s -> 7992.48s]  This game is moving into the force.
[7992.88s -> 8014.07s]  I just want you to know that 3.4.
[8014.57s -> 8019.04s]  Oh, I like it.
[8019.54s -> 8020.74s]  This is really cute and fun.
[8020.74s -> 8021.84s]  I don't have anything to complain about.
[8021.84s -> 8024.04s]  I wish I could I wish I could sit here and be like, well,
[8024.04s -> 8029.30s]  you know, I don't like animals.
[8029.30s -> 8030.90s]  Like, what do you want me to say?
[8032.37s -> 8034.17s]  I don't like this game because I don't like turtles.
[8034.17s -> 8035.57s]  I don't like reptiles.
[8035.57s -> 8039.67s]  It pisses me off reptiles piss me off.
[8041.86s -> 8046.30s]  I can't think of a reason why you would not like it and
[8046.30s -> 8048.30s]  excuse me community.
[8049.76s -> 8053.40s]  One of our favorite things of all time is a game called
[8053.40s -> 8058.37s]  Super Frog, which is far less complex than this game.
[8062.27s -> 8063.07s]  Oh, I got a big one.
[8069.82s -> 8072.82s]  So you can merge three or is that only specifically and
[8076.71s -> 8077.31s]  let's find out.
[8079.01s -> 8079.61s]  All right.
[8079.61s -> 8080.91s]  You got a new mechanic here now.
[8086.95s -> 8087.45s]  That's three.
[8087.45s -> 8087.95s]  Oh, no.
[8087.95s -> 8088.35s]  Okay.
[8088.65s -> 8098.69s]  The little ones ones with a smaller design game doesn't
[8098.69s -> 8099.09s]  have candy.
[8099.09s -> 8099.89s]  You don't know that yet.
[8102.42s -> 8117.12s]  We just started playing it and it's like Beach, you know,
[8117.92s -> 8119.02s]  wait, I can combine.
[8125.66s -> 8126.46s]  I need to combine.
[8139.04s -> 8140.44s]  Yeah, it's summertime.
[8142.48s -> 8143.38s]  It's nice out.
[8146.53s -> 8149.03s]  Somebody said check your CPU and GPU usage to make sure
[8149.03s -> 8154.39s]  this is not a oh, oh, come on, please.
[8154.49s -> 8155.39s]  No, that's it.
[8155.99s -> 8160.49s]  Things just can't be fun and simple with like a cool
[8160.49s -> 8169.37s]  mechanic shit.
[8169.37s -> 8169.97s]  This is gonna be hard.
[8180.73s -> 8181.43s]  Did I get them all?
[8181.83s -> 8182.63s]  I think it is right.
[8185.13s -> 8185.53s]  I did.
[8185.53s -> 8186.13s]  I got everybody.
[8187.17s -> 8188.57s]  Can I combine the big Turtles?
[8196.59s -> 8198.49s]  Oh, almost three.
[8203.05s -> 8203.45s]  All right.
[8203.65s -> 8205.65s]  Well, I think I'm almost at the end of the demo.
[8205.65s -> 8206.85s]  Let's do we'll do one or two more.
[8207.45s -> 8207.95s]  I like it.
[8208.25s -> 8209.45s]  Three big ones makes a bigger one.
[8216.60s -> 8219.40s]  Yeah, almost 90% of you guys like Turtles.
[8220.20s -> 8221.50s]  You'll be buying this game when it comes up.
[8221.90s -> 8222.60s]  I guarantee it.
[8228.36s -> 8230.56s]  And then a year after this comes out, you're still going
[8230.56s -> 8231.76s]  to be listening to the soundtrack.
[8233.42s -> 8238.22s]  And then your YouTube history will be Turtles Steam OST.
[8239.22s -> 8247.62s]  You can't fool me.
[8257.88s -> 8259.48s]  Get a game over before you stop playing.
[8260.48s -> 8261.68s]  Yeah, that sounds fair.
[8264.71s -> 8269.50s]  We do have a lot more to go through which we don't have
[8269.50s -> 8270.50s]  to do all of them, right?
[8273.24s -> 8275.44s]  It's not like, oh my God, we have to play every single demo.
[8275.54s -> 8276.44s]  This is just a cool.
[8277.04s -> 8278.14s]  I like this event a lot.
[8282.00s -> 8285.20s]  It makes it so stuff that I never would have even cared
[8285.20s -> 8285.60s]  about.
[8285.80s -> 8288.10s]  It's just I'm going to try it because it's just there.
[8289.98s -> 8292.68s]  It's just available and you can just get it and try it
[8293.18s -> 8294.28s]  and the games aren't out yet.
[8294.48s -> 8297.18s]  I would probably be less excited about this event if the
[8297.18s -> 8299.18s]  games that you could download were games that were like,
[8299.18s -> 8300.18s]  oh, they've been out already.
[8300.78s -> 8301.58s]  But these are most of these.
[8301.58s -> 8303.08s]  I think all of them are not out yet.
[8303.78s -> 8304.48s]  That's really cool.
[8306.18s -> 8308.28s]  It's like a little little taste like a little sneak peek.
[8310.12s -> 8310.92s]  I got to combine some.
[8310.92s -> 8311.12s]  Yeah.
[8313.73s -> 8314.13s]  All right, give me that.
[8314.13s -> 8314.93s]  Let's combine the big ones.
[8317.69s -> 8318.09s]  Shit.
[8322.10s -> 8322.70s]  Oh shit.
[8323.40s -> 8323.80s]  Fine.
[8354.13s -> 8355.03s]  Hey, what's going on here?
[8356.61s -> 8357.21s]  That's three.
[8359.40s -> 8359.80s]  That was three.
[8359.80s -> 8360.30s]  What happened?
[8366.04s -> 8366.64s]  I missed an egg.
[8368.58s -> 8369.28s]  I can't miss an egg.
[8370.28s -> 8371.78s]  Why did the three big ones not combine?
[8380.20s -> 8381.20s]  Oh fuck you.
[8383.37s -> 8384.37s]  I shouldn't even come back down here.
[8401.26s -> 8402.26s]  So why won't they combine?
[8405.34s -> 8406.14s]  There's three in a row.
[8406.64s -> 8416.88s]  Too big.
[8416.88s -> 8418.18s]  I thought the big ones could combine too.
[8426.09s -> 8427.49s]  And this is temporary assets.
[8429.46s -> 8430.96s]  So you tell me this game is only going to get better.
[8435.71s -> 8436.51s]  All right, this last one.
[8439.21s -> 8441.21s]  Oh, that's the pattern for the big ones.
[8441.21s -> 8441.61s]  I get it.
[8441.91s -> 8443.01s]  So it's got to be in like a triangle.
[8447.86s -> 8449.66s]  Yeah, games get scores for different reasons.
[8451.48s -> 8455.81s]  If I give this like a four three, which I'm not going to,
[8455.81s -> 8458.81s]  but if I do and the game I played before this was like a
[8458.81s -> 8460.91s]  four two or something.
[8461.21s -> 8464.28s]  Remember this is based on it.
[8464.48s -> 8465.38s]  It's like a four.
[8465.98s -> 8467.38s]  It's a four point one.
[8468.18s -> 8469.98s]  For the genre that it is in.
[8470.88s -> 8474.18s]  This does not mean that this game is better than any of the
[8474.18s -> 8475.98s]  more elaborate demos we've played.
[8476.38s -> 8480.68s]  This is a four point one in the category of puzzle fun kids
[8480.68s -> 8483.08s]  based children's type games.
[8484.18s -> 8484.58s]  You know what I mean?
[8484.58s -> 8487.68s]  Like entertainment E for everyone puzzle like kids can
[8487.68s -> 8489.18s]  play it old people can play it.
[8489.18s -> 8489.78s]  I can play it.
[8489.78s -> 8490.58s]  You can play it.
[8490.98s -> 8493.68s]  20 year olds can play it 40 year olds can play E for everybody.
[8499.15s -> 8500.55s]  I think I think I'm in trouble here.
[8501.25s -> 8528.37s]  Go faster.
[8529.27s -> 8530.37s]  I'm doing fine.
[8536.66s -> 8536.86s]  Yeah.
[8536.86s -> 8537.66s]  No, not even kids.
[8537.76s -> 8538.36s]  Not even kids game.
[8538.36s -> 8541.16s]  I'm just saying like an anybody can play it and enjoy it anybody
[8541.96s -> 8548.30s]  going to go this way.
[8549.40s -> 8550.40s]  No, I gotta wrap around.
[8554.84s -> 8556.34s]  I would rather just go crawl on the beach.
[8558.34s -> 8558.64s]  Yeah.
[8558.64s -> 8560.74s]  Okay, so go to the beach then.
[8562.24s -> 8562.54s]  Why?
[8562.54s -> 8563.04s]  Why is that?
[8563.04s -> 8564.94s]  Why do you have to have one or the other?
[8567.29s -> 8568.49s]  Nah, dude, I don't want to play this.
[8568.49s -> 8569.89s]  I'd rather go to the beach instead.

[9462.25s -> 9463.15s]  Where are the crates?
[9469.62s -> 9470.62s]  I can't, man.
[9473.16s -> 9474.46s]  Okay, interact with the crates.

[11249.01s -> 11250.31s]  No, not virgin.
[11251.11s -> 11257.07s]  Well, this is pretty.
[11287.05s -> 11288.55s]  This is, this is nice.
[11289.05s -> 11289.85s]  This is nice.
[11294.58s -> 11320.69s]  These are kind of shrooms that you smoke.
[11321.69s -> 11322.89s]  But you don't smoke mushrooms.
[11322.89s -> 11323.89s]  You don't smoke shrooms.
[11323.89s -> 11325.19s]  I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[11333.00s -> 11333.60s]  You get to live.
[11334.20s -> 11341.81s]  How does he know?
[11343.84s -> 11345.34s]  Why wouldn't I know that?
[11351.75s -> 11352.55s]  Ooh, cool.
[11368.81s -> 11369.31s]  Shit.
[11370.91s -> 11376.52s]  All right, one more try.
[11376.62s -> 11376.92s]  That's it.
[11377.42s -> 11378.22s]  I'm done with this one.
[11378.62s -> 11379.02s]  One more try.
[11381.19s -> 11382.39s]  You suck at this game.
[11382.99s -> 11384.09s]  The game is kind of tricky.
[11394.57s -> 11395.27s]  One more try and that's it.
[11427.44s -> 11429.94s]  Environments are beautiful and the gameplay has a lot of potential.
[11430.14s -> 11432.64s]  Sound design and music need a lot of, need a lot of work.
[11433.78s -> 11434.48s]  I would agree with that.
[11436.25s -> 11436.75s]  But here's the thing.
[11437.65s -> 11438.95s]  And this is something that's really important.
[11441.55s -> 11442.85s]  It's if you really think about it.
[11442.85s -> 11446.55s]  It's probably less than five to ten people doing this.
[11448.66s -> 11451.06s]  So that's why all these games, right?
[11451.36s -> 11452.16s]  Well, most of them, right?
[11454.68s -> 11458.18s]  You are never going to hear me say like, oh, wow.
[11458.98s -> 11460.68s]  This game's fucking awful, right?
[11460.68s -> 11461.48s]  Like why would I do that?
[11462.48s -> 11466.08s]  It takes a lot of fucking guts to kind of put yourself out there
[11466.08s -> 11466.78s]  and do this kind of shit.
[11466.98s -> 11467.38s]  It does.
[11468.38s -> 11469.78s]  And if you only have like a few people,
[11472.42s -> 11474.02s]  like especially if it's only one or two people.
[11477.09s -> 11479.79s]  I mean, this is, this is remarkable for it being a small team, right?
[11481.19s -> 11483.69s]  Yeah, you got to, I don't want, here's the thing.
[11484.89s -> 11489.09s]  I think discouraging people from doing something that they, that they're
[11489.09s -> 11490.59s]  like passionate about and they think is cool.
[11490.89s -> 11491.69s]  And this is good.
[11491.69s -> 11492.89s]  This is actually fucking good.
[11495.22s -> 11497.82s]  I wouldn't be able to do something like this, even if I really spent time on it.
[11498.72s -> 11503.62s]  I don't ever want anyone to think that like, oh, my game's fucking bad.
[11504.42s -> 11504.92s]  Oh shit.
[11504.92s -> 11508.02s]  No, I don't want somebody to, I don't want to like rain on somebody's passion,
[11508.02s -> 11511.52s]  rain on somebody's, you know, way they try to make a living and everything, right?
[11512.02s -> 11512.82s]  I'm not going to do that.
[11515.43s -> 11517.23s]  Could this game use a little work?
[11517.53s -> 11519.53s]  Yeah, it absolutely fucking could.
[11521.36s -> 11523.76s]  But I think it's fun.
[11524.76s -> 11525.86s]  I think this is good shit.
[11528.97s -> 11529.97s]  A little bit more time in the oven.
[11529.97s -> 11531.27s]  This thing can be fucking fantastic.
[11535.34s -> 11535.64s]  Now.
[11535.64s -> 11535.94s]  Yes.
[11535.94s -> 11537.14s]  You've heard me say, yeah.
[11537.14s -> 11537.44s]  All right.
[11537.44s -> 11537.74s]  Hold on.
[11538.04s -> 11540.44s]  But like fuck Capcom is a little different.
[11541.78s -> 11545.18s]  It's not, that's not like three people making Resident Evil 8.
[11545.58s -> 11545.98s]  Okay.
[11549.20s -> 11551.80s]  There's not one guy didn't make Resident Evil 8.
[11553.72s -> 11555.82s]  If they did, holy shit.
[11555.82s -> 11557.22s]  That would be a crowning achievement.
[11574.24s -> 11574.84s]  Yeah.
[11574.94s -> 11578.34s]  This is, this is, this is a time for us to come together as gamers.
[11578.94s -> 11579.54s]  I'm a gamer.
[11579.64s -> 11580.14s]  Don't forget.
[11582.19s -> 11585.19s]  And celebrate all the cool shit that people are making.
[11585.19s -> 11586.39s]  That's a coming up, right?
[11590.37s -> 11594.07s]  So I'm, the rating system is more of a joke than anything else.
[11594.97s -> 11596.57s]  I don't, it's not actually accurate, right?
[11596.57s -> 11597.47s]  Cause this is a demo.
[11597.47s -> 11598.07s]  This is not like it.
[11599.50s -> 11601.40s]  It's not like this is the full experience.
[11601.40s -> 11603.40s]  Some of these games are a year away.
[11604.50s -> 11606.00s]  Just admit that you hate this.
[11606.60s -> 11606.90s]  What?
[11606.90s -> 11607.50s]  I don't.
[11607.90s -> 11608.70s]  Oh, you know, you didn't say this.
[11608.70s -> 11610.10s]  You said that you hate video games.
[11610.30s -> 11611.50s]  You know, I kind of do.
[11612.60s -> 11613.50s]  I kind of do.
[11613.50s -> 11613.90s]  Okay.
[11621.84s -> 11625.17s]  Same, same, same.
[11625.17s -> 11625.47s]  All right.
[11625.47s -> 11627.67s]  So we're going to, we, we agree then we, we agree.
[11639.22s -> 11639.52s]  All right.
[11639.52s -> 11639.92s]  Last try.
[11639.92s -> 11640.22s]  That's it.
[11641.52s -> 11650.88s]  We're going to actually try this one now.
[11650.88s -> 11651.18s]  Okay.
[11651.18s -> 11656.83s]  Hold on geeks.
[11659.83s -> 11661.93s]  Why do you have to be such a positive Peter?
[11663.01s -> 11665.01s]  I'm really not even a positive Peter.
[11665.51s -> 11667.41s]  You guys have been here for a long time.
[11668.51s -> 11673.45s]  I'm not really positive Peter.
[11674.45s -> 11686.70s]  He's a positive Peter.
[11686.70s -> 11690.37s]  Come on.
[11693.84s -> 11700.06s]  No, I cannot reliably tell you that a game is good or bad based
[11700.06s -> 11702.06s]  on a 15 minute demo.
[11702.66s -> 11703.46s]  That's impossible.
[11703.76s -> 11704.36s]  That's not possible.
[11706.30s -> 11713.56s]  I actually like what I'm doing.
[11715.06s -> 11722.20s]  This game is called Frog Monster.
[11722.80s -> 11723.30s]  One word.
[11725.04s -> 11726.14s]  Turn the music down a little.
[11728.04s -> 11730.28s]  There we go.
[11730.28s -> 11737.98s]  That's kind of the point of a demo to see if you like it.
[11739.90s -> 11747.05s]  Oh, yeah.
[11748.95s -> 11749.75s]  Don't die, please.
[11753.70s -> 11758.36s]  Smash, smash, smash, smash, smash.
[11759.26s -> 11759.36s]  All right.
[11759.36s -> 11759.76s]  That's it.
[11760.26s -> 11760.86s]  That was fun.
[11760.96s -> 11762.88s]  That was called Frog Monster.
[11763.98s -> 11764.98s]  It's somewhere in the threes.
[11765.78s -> 11768.58s]  I actually like the death screen.
[11768.58s -> 11769.08s]  I think it's cool.
[11769.58s -> 11779.65s]  I come in next.
[11780.45s -> 11786.38s]  We've got, uh, please do Slayers X.
[11786.98s -> 11787.48s]  I will.
[11792.25s -> 11793.05s]  Oh, cat, right.
[11794.35s -> 11801.60s]  Grand Theft Gato, Vice Kitty.
[11802.84s -> 11803.44s]  The graphics up.
[11803.44s -> 11804.04s]  I think this is good.
[11804.04s -> 11804.54s]  How does this work?
[11804.54s -> 11805.04s]  Press B to meow.
[11805.04s -> 11806.04s]  Good cats can navigate.
[11806.04s -> 11835.63s]  Press M to view the local map.
[11835.63s -> 11843.28s]  Holy shit.
[11843.28s -> 11843.78s]  This is a whole city.
[11843.78s -> 11844.28s]  Okay.
[11844.28s -> 11858.72s]  Hi, it's great to see you.
[11858.72s -> 11859.22s]  You can really get hungry earning likes and subscribers.
[11859.22s -> 11859.72s]  We're out of food again.
[11859.72s -> 11866.41s]  I'll get it.
[11866.41s -> 11866.91s]  The downstairs door is locked.
[11866.91s -> 11867.41s]  We're trapped in here.
[11867.41s -> 11867.91s]  Man is too tired to shop.
[11867.91s -> 11868.41s]  Maybe he needs some candy.
[11868.41s -> 11868.91s]  Okay.
[11868.91s -> 11869.41s]  Man is too tired to shop.
[11869.41s -> 11871.04s]  Maybe he needs some candy.
[11871.04s -> 11871.54s]  Man is too tired to shop.
[11871.54s -> 11872.04s]  Man is too tired to shop.
[11872.04s -> 11872.54s]  Man is too tired to shop.
[11872.54s -> 11873.04s]  Man is too tired to shop.
[11873.04s -> 11878.46s]  Man is too tired to shop.
[11878.46s -> 11878.96s]  Man is too tired to shop.
[11879.36s -> 11879.86s]  Okay.
[11895.46s -> 11896.46s]  Binding human ten candy.
[11898.46s -> 11904.66s]  There's candy in the box.
[11904.66s -> 11905.16s]  Okay.
[11905.16s -> 11924.94s]  All right, here's candy.
[11924.94s -> 11925.94s]  Talk to Ricky.
[11932.58s -> 11933.08s]  He'll go shopping soon.
[11933.08s -> 11934.08s]  Now there's a cat downstairs he wants to talk to you.
[11934.08s -> 11935.58s]  Let's go.
[11936.58s -> 11937.08s]  The fuck.
[11937.08s -> 11937.58s]  And what do you do?
[11937.58s -> 11938.58s]  WHAT?!
[11942.05s -> 11956.13s]  Get the hell away from me! This guy's going to kick me? What the fuck? Oh my god, I'm on his head!
[11956.93s -> 11971.47s]  What the fuck is happening? Get this guy out of here! Am I ready? Find the strange cat. Okay.
[11972.27s -> 11982.32s]  Ponzilla. Want some sick power-ups? Yes. Okay, ever heard of XP? It piles up as you do awesome,
[11982.32s -> 11988.03s]  but it's useless by itself. You gotta spend it, cat. Open your inventory and look at the upper
[11988.03s -> 12008.72s]  left corner. Oh, okay. What did I just do? Are those hairballs? I'm not big, but you need me.
[12008.72s -> 12013.74s]  Okay, what do I need? Ever seen your journal? It's how you avoid getting lost. Open it with J.
[12014.78s -> 12031.81s]  Okay. In your journal, you can manage tasks. Click a finished one to get XP. Oh, all right. Okay. Yes.
[12031.81s -> 12039.20s]  Love cheese, I guess. Beep boop wrong. You didn't use J to read the task. What? I can't stand this
[12039.20s -> 12042.64s]  stuff. Why is my name Mouse3 anyway? This world makes no sense. All right, let's go.
[12043.52s -> 12063.60s]  Find Trinikitty next. She will help you with your skills. Wait, are you ready? I believe.
[12064.24s -> 12084.96s]  Climb the bookcase over there, jump at it, left click and hold. How? What the fuck? I got the
[12084.96s -> 12110.67s]  candy. You gotta- I can climb anything? Okay, I can climb anything. Find the strange cat. You can
[12110.67s -> 12131.33s]  climb anything. Are you the strange cat? What does that sound? What? How much for level one melee?
[12131.33s -> 12140.14s]  Um, how do I- what do I do? How do I see that? How do I get that menu? How do I get to that menu?
[12149.57s -> 12162.67s]  50. Okay, got it. All right, I gotta find the strange cat downstairs. How do I get downstairs?
[12163.23s -> 12181.63s]  There we go. Malthus. Okay. Talk to my crew. They will show you the way to the outside world.
[12183.36s -> 12190.10s]  My crew is on the second floor. I can only give you the keys to the door. You must walk
[12190.10s -> 12196.26s]  through it. Find Mayor Mittens and your destiny. Open your inventory and equip the keys.
[12198.86s -> 12226.78s]  Okay. How do I get out of here? I'm out. Let's go. Can you drive a car? Can I drive a car?
[12228.43s -> 12250.22s]  What the fuck? You can drive a car? Why can I drive a car? Dirty whiskers. Sorry, you know,
[12250.22s -> 12255.65s]  this is the demo, but hey, what's the next best thing to owning the game? Wish listing it on
[12255.65s -> 12259.25s]  Steam because that's where all the stuff is coming out. Don't you want to do it? I'm not
[12259.25s -> 12261.65s]  going to click that because I think it might actually do it. I don't know. I'm afraid to
[12261.65s -> 12285.66s]  like click that button. All right, so where do I go? Oh, no, don't ghost ride the car.
[12295.06s -> 12351.60s]  Funk music? Did I kill that guy? What's going on here? Okay. All right. Well, what's going on
[12351.60s -> 12365.47s]  here? What happened? What's it? Diesel tools? Wait, maybe you can tell me. Give me fuel. Give me fire.
[12369.87s -> 12377.84s]  They're cheering on a race? Oh, okay. Let's go. You ready? Three, two, one, go.
[12386.00s -> 12389.04s]  The car I'm telling right now. Give me the controller. I think it's probably going to be
[12389.04s -> 12423.23s]  easier. Nope. I died. I can't jump. Oh, wait, somebody here. All right. There's Mayor Mittens.
[12424.77s -> 12432.50s]  Okay. Here we go. You want to work for me? Yes. Oh my God. A lackey of my own. You've made it.
[12433.30s -> 12439.78s]  Okay. Right. Work. To be my helper, you need wheels. There's a small car to your right.
[12440.42s -> 12480.51s]  Go take it for a small car. Okay. Hi Ed. W A S D to drive. Yeah, this is a why does it keep
[12480.51s -> 12498.06s]  cycling through gears? The car doesn't sound right. I'm not even holding the acceleration.
[12498.86s -> 12528.94s]  Well, to be fair, a cat wouldn't know how to use a manual. I mean, not yet. Oh, I gotta do one, two,
[12529.02s -> 12548.59s]  three, four, five. Okay. Two. Where's three? Where's three?
[12566.59s -> 12572.06s]  I know not yet. I'm trying to go over here. It's way too dank.
[12572.78s -> 12609.10s]  All right. The turning is a little slow. Don't. Okay. Four, five, six. Four, five, six.
[12610.45s -> 12621.97s]  No way. That was six. All right. What do you need, Mittens? Okay. We're over the big time.
[12621.97s -> 12627.23s]  I got some real work now. It's gonna be intense. Get ready. Person was making a tree for it and
[12627.23s -> 12632.83s]  now they're stuck in the tree. Crazy day, right? I need to go get them down. Fire cats are already
[12632.83s -> 12637.86s]  there to help. Jump, hold, attack the human's back and hold down the button. You can drive
[12637.86s -> 12661.63s]  him around like that. Okay. Over there. All right. Let's go. Where's my car? I don't need a car.
[12661.63s -> 12701.87s]  Why can't this guy get down? I don't understand why you can't get down. Okay. Let's go.
[12701.87s -> 12720.37s]  Oh, you're welcome. What game is this? The game is called Grand Theft Gato Vice Kitty.
[12726.54s -> 12734.14s]  Okay. Signed up my amazing helper cat. Your reward is a new toy. Maybe it's a gun, a pack,
[12734.14s -> 12740.69s]  a thingy. Okay. Works in a garage over by the apartments. Tell him I'm counting on his vote.
[12740.69s -> 12753.68s]  Okay. Let's move. This gets at least five letter grades because of the title. Oh, give me this car.
[12769.54s -> 12789.17s]  Wait, where is this? Oh, it's right here. Okay. I made something amazing. Cat pack 9,000.
[12789.89s -> 12809.98s]  Assemble the pieces. Okay. I yawned, but I don't want to be yawning on camera. Don't
[12809.98s -> 12824.16s]  fucking drive off the edge. I got another one. It's fine. All right. Find the pieces.
[12824.88s -> 12834.93s]  End of the stream voice. No, no, I'm fine. I'll go refill my tea. Wait, where is this stuff?
[12835.81s -> 12850.58s]  Wait, was it right next to me? T means he's going to go smoke a bowl.
[12851.46s -> 12871.81s]  Where is this stuff? Oh, it's up here. I don't smoke. I don't smoke weed. I eat it.
[12873.04s -> 12889.76s]  I like it better. You know why I like to eat it, by the way, if you have, you know, you know,
[12889.76s -> 12894.40s]  and you're over 21, you know, it's illegal in your area and you just be careful. All things in
[12894.40s -> 12900.96s]  moderation. When I smoke weed, I don't like how fast smoking weed hits you. And then it's just gone.
[12902.82s -> 12911.06s]  It's like, boom, it's an absolute explosion. Just and then it's gone in like 30 minutes.
[12912.80s -> 12920.10s]  I like the feeling of letting it kind of work up for an hour or two. And then you can stay in that
[12920.10s -> 12931.62s]  kind of mellow state, whatever you want to be in for a few hours. I like it. That's why I like to
[12931.62s -> 12947.06s]  eat it. 30 minutes. It's like four hours for me. Um, I don't have very much experience with smoking.
[12947.06s -> 12952.02s]  I'd rather eat it. So but the few times I've done it, it was just like, so I was like, too,
[12952.02s -> 12956.74s]  too much. And it just hit me like a truck for like half an hour to an hour. And then you just have
[12956.74s -> 12963.34s]  to come down. I feel a little I know a lot of people the opposite, where it's like, if you take
[12963.34s -> 12969.82s]  a view, eat it. And all of a sudden, you're you don't want to be high for four or five hours,
[12969.82s -> 12974.21s]  right? Because that's sometimes if you do a lot of edibles or whatever that can happen.
[12974.21s -> 12995.92s]  And I get that I get it completely. How do I get on the roof? It's also what your body's used to.
[12995.92s -> 13006.56s]  Yeah, that's true. How do I get on the roof? Edibles can really sneak up on you. Yes, they can.
[13006.56s -> 13021.23s]  That's why you should really be very careful with it. It really depends on the person. Oh, yeah.
[13023.17s -> 13030.80s]  If you like smoking it versus eating it. Absolutely. All right, I'm done. We're gonna
[13030.80s -> 13038.40s]  do another one. Actually, let me get some tea. I need to perk up a little. I need to pick me up.
[13040.16s -> 13046.42s]  That was Grand Theft Gato Vice Kitty. It was pretty fun. I think I like I think the music's
[13046.42s -> 13052.86s]  part of my favorite part. I'll be right back and refill my water. Get some tea with it. I'll see in
[13052.86s -> 13096.83s]  like two, three minutes, maybe five minutes. BRB. I'm still here. I just wanted to somebody mentioned
[13096.83s -> 13104.08s]  the so what the when I when I get tea, some of the time I get something called liquid IV.
[13104.96s -> 13107.76s]  And somebody said be careful those things like 100 milligrams of caffeine.
[13108.40s -> 13112.72s]  See, I do this. This is my tactic with it. I usually only do half a packet.
[13113.44s -> 13120.61s]  I usually do about it's about 40 milligrams of caffeine. Liquid IV is amazing. Yes.
[13121.33s -> 13132.50s]  It's got a kind of a strange name. Not 100 milligrams of THC. What the fuck are you talking
[13132.50s -> 13135.78s]  about? No, no, no, no, no, no. We're talking about two completely different things.
[13136.58s -> 13144.69s]  Let me separate this out. The powder that I use is green tea powder, right? This matcha powder.
[13146.22s -> 13155.30s]  And this liquid IV is the name of the brand or whatever. It's like a little packet. 100 milligrams
[13155.30s -> 13163.82s]  of caffeine is not that big of a deal. Cup of coffee is what 80 70 to 90. So that's not a big
[13163.82s -> 13176.14s]  deal. One cup of coffee is less than 100. A little bit less than 100. Something between 40 50 60.
[13177.60s -> 13184.62s]  Regular green tea is 30. Yeah, no, I am not drinking. Let me be really clear about this.
[13184.62s -> 13189.49s]  I really like these things. They've been I've been drinking a lot of them over the last few
[13189.49s -> 13198.78s]  months. Maybe like I don't do it every day. Maybe like once every once every three or four days,
[13198.78s -> 13206.14s]  once every five days. So once a week, twice a week. But here's the thing. You do one packet
[13206.14s -> 13216.59s]  over the course of like pretty much a whole day, which ends up being about the equivalent of maybe
[13216.59s -> 13231.94s]  two cups of coffee. But I like it a lot. I really do. No, no, no, no. Yeah, it's electrolytes too.
[13231.94s -> 13243.46s]  Yeah. Essentially, it's kind of like a Gatorade with green tea powder and caffeine in it.
[13243.46s -> 13248.45s]  So if I don't match a powder like green tea powder is only like 30 milligrams.
[13249.50s -> 13255.98s]  If I really need something, I'll drink one of these liquid IVs. Yeah, I'm talking about caffeine.
[13261.34s -> 13266.58s]  Yeah, no, no, no, no. This stuff is no. Trust me, I wouldn't drink this if I didn't think it was
[13266.58s -> 13278.48s]  any good. This is an ad. No, no, I just actually drink these matches. Not that high in caffeine
[13278.48s -> 13286.56s]  isn't the green tea is 30 milligrams of caffeine. Some people drink a bunch of monster a day. Yeah,
[13286.56s -> 13289.68s]  I always try to stay. I know I'm supposed to be leaving, supposed to get out of here.
[13290.40s -> 13298.59s]  But I really realistically, real talk, I've tried to cut a lot of the coffee I drink a day.
[13300.06s -> 13309.17s]  So I typically will replace coffee with one of these green tea drinks. And it's yeah, you know,
[13309.17s -> 13319.76s]  still has caffeine, but it's fine. And the company in general, too, I like looked into the company
[13319.76s -> 13327.10s]  too. I think they're at least what they claim. They try to be sustainable and stuff. So that's
[13327.10s -> 13340.56s]  cool. Don't leave. How is this not an ad? I'm not being paid to tell you this. This is something
[13340.56s -> 13348.70s]  that I literally do on a weekly basis. I mean, could it be an ad? Sure. I mean, yeah, I guess so.
[13349.34s -> 13363.63s]  Have you ever had matcha ice cream? Oh, yeah. I became a green tea Andy over the last six months.
[13363.63s -> 13388.56s]  I love it. You should email them thoughts on coffee ice cream. I got okay, I gotta go. But
[13388.56s -> 13392.96s]  yeah, sponsorships and, you know, advertisement type shit. You guys know that I'm
[13393.84s -> 13404.32s]  evolved is working on that stuff. So I don't know. That'd be kind of cool. I mean, I actually use it.
[13408.16s -> 13422.26s]  Get a matcha sponsor. No, no. All right. I actually BRBS in a minute. Wait, somebody raided? What
[13422.26s -> 13428.10s]  happened? Can I wait, wait, wait. Somebody actually raided. Who raided? I can't see it.
[13428.10s -> 13444.22s]  This is a big raid. I can't even see who it is. Who is it? Big balls raid. Big balls. Big balls.
[13445.02s -> 13453.18s]  Um, thanks a lot. Big balls. I appreciate it. Everybody coming over. Thanks for the raid.
[13453.82s -> 13462.74s]  Hold on. Are you guys making this up? I saw a lot of like big balls, big balls and like, hey,
[13462.74s -> 13475.76s]  we're here. I don't know. I don't understand. Hold on. Let me look at my dashboard. I got,
[13475.84s -> 13484.42s]  yeah, I got trolled. I didn't. Yeah, I seriously did. Yeah, that's okay. Yeah, there's no raid.
[13484.42s -> 13824.99s]  Okay. All right. I'll be right back. Bye. What's up? How you doing? The big balls raid was real.
[13826.11s -> 13841.09s]  Yeah. From beta 64. Oh, cool. All right. So it was real. Well, thanks for doing it. Welcome guys.
[13852.19s -> 13858.74s]  You pissed on a raid? What? No, I didn't. I even asked and I looked. What are you talking about?
[13858.74s -> 13880.53s]  You're so high. You keep laughing like Seth Rogen. Such a specific. I'm not even sure if it's an
[13880.53s -> 13886.61s]  insult or not, but in a specific comment. Okay, let's go. What else was it? What was the other
[13886.61s -> 13899.74s]  one I downloaded? There's one more. What did I have queued up? Pi. Oh, the pirate game. Right.
[13899.74s -> 13923.04s]  Turn that off. Get it open. Very cool. This game is very bright. It's very colorful. Just wanted
[13923.04s -> 13956.03s]  to warn you. Why is all this off? Oh, sorry. Okay. All this is turned off. I don't know why.
[13956.75s -> 13977.28s]  You guys ready for the pirate bay? Pirates Bay. Pirates Bay. Let's go. New game. You can roll to
[13977.28s -> 13991.47s]  avoid damage. Probably controller, right? Yeah. Control scheme. Change the controller. Okay.
[13991.47s -> 14004.21s]  That's jump. Crouch. Oh, F1. That's going to be different. All right. That's dodge. This is a
[14004.21s -> 14018.48s]  dodge roll or dodge roll. Use. Move. Hide. Change. Target. Aim. Attack. Oh, shit. That's block.
[14019.20s -> 14040.30s]  All right. We'll figure it out. Talk. A. Talk. Talk. A. A. A. All right. What is it over here?
[14040.30s -> 14054.43s]  E. What's up? I don't want to spend any money right now. No. Is there a sprint? Okay. Just
[14054.43s -> 14072.34s]  checking to see what happened. Am I holding my head underwater? How do I get back up? I just want to
[14072.34s -> 14079.46s]  see if he died if he jumped in the water. Where do I go? Where do I go to get up from here?
[14086.67s -> 14099.20s]  All right. Use ladder. There we go. Oh, yeah. That was quick. Okay. So now what do I do?
[14104.56s -> 14133.44s]  Put the sails up. All right. Let's move. Let's go for it. Can I steer? Let's go. Let's go. We're
[14133.44s -> 14160.83s]  going to that island right there. Open your sails. Oh, shit. All right. Now let's go. Am I steering?
[14160.83s -> 14180.29s]  How do you steer? Okay. We're going to do a keyboard. You only have one person on this
[14180.29s -> 14192.58s]  whole crew. I would be freaking out if I saw this coming into the port. How do you... Is there a
[14192.58s -> 14201.89s]  break? All right. How do you... So I made it this town. How do I stop the boat from moving?
[14202.69s -> 14231.71s]  I need to put the anchor out? Where's the anchor? There's no... There's no brake pedal, dude. Oh,
[14231.71s -> 14270.03s]  drop anchor. I got way anchor. Wait. Okay. I got to get closer. Why do I need a crew? I need... I
[14270.03s -> 14275.86s]  can't just do this by myself. I need to take a cigar out of my mouth. Be like, all right, hoist
[14275.86s -> 14282.50s]  the sails. Why am I doing this by myself? Oh, fuck. We're getting in... We're coming in hot.
[14291.33s -> 14316.43s]  All right. Stop. There we go. That's not going anywhere, right? No, we're good. This guy looks
[14316.43s -> 14326.42s]  like he's waiting for me. What do I get? I want a weapon. Is this a hostile territory? I have no
[14326.42s -> 14341.42s]  idea. Is this a hostile territory for me? I don't think so. Oh, wait. What's up there? Okay.
[14342.14s -> 14349.94s]  Oh, a pirate. Want to see my weapons and ammo for sale. Okay. You've got a saber, musket,
[14350.66s -> 14356.59s]  blunderbuss. That's actually a lot of weapons. All right. I need... I need like a thousand bucks.
[14357.23s -> 14370.16s]  Thousand bucks. I think it's like a quest up here. All right. What is that? See? 20 meters.
[14370.72s -> 14394.58s]  I'm going that way. Your boat is floating away. No, it's not. Do I need to kill this guy? Hello,
[14394.58s -> 14398.34s]  traveler. Have you heard of the legends of the most terrifying pirates of these seas?
[14398.34s -> 14403.49s]  I can tell you where to find them for a small fee. And if you beat them, your profit will be
[14403.49s -> 14418.94s]  much larger. Okay. Where is the rogue admiral? Thank you. Let's go get him. All right. Where's
[14418.94s -> 14430.35s]  my... All right. Where's my... That's such a scam. Oh, there we go. No. Oh, there we go. Okay. Over
[14430.35s -> 14442.98s]  there. 1,700 meters that way. Yeah. I spent all my money, but I'm going to get... I'm going to go
[14442.98s -> 14451.30s]  here. I'm going to get my... I'm going to kill this guy. Get a bounty for it. I thought that was just
[14451.30s -> 14463.57s]  rolling credits. I was like, we're getting credits already? Did I run out of time? That's not my
[14463.57s -> 14478.34s]  boat right there, right? That's not my boat, right? No, that's my boat. Brawl demo time, right? Yeah.
[14478.34s -> 14497.34s]  That's how I was like... Right over to the music. This thing's in sync, right? What's the game? The
[14497.34s -> 14512.22s]  game is called Pirate Bay. Pirates Bay. Part of the Steam demo week. Go check it out if you think
[14512.22s -> 14518.02s]  it's cool. You don't have... It's literally free. You don't have to do anything, but just install
[14518.02s -> 14545.26s]  the game. That's it. Okay. Let's go find this guy. 1,800 meters this way. All right. Full speed ahead.
[14545.82s -> 14584.54s]  I just... I... Somebody just talked about my beard. They don't like it. They don't like it.
[14585.18s -> 14602.46s]  Well, I'm shaving today, so... All right. Let's do it. Let's get him. I don't have any weapons.
[14603.18s -> 14632.10s]  How am I going to fight this guy? He's on this island. I'll just beat his ass. It's fine.
[14645.66s -> 14654.70s]  Self-overcorrecting. I've never driven a sail... a boat like... a ship like this before. Sorry. I'm
[14654.70s -> 14668.03s]  overdoing it. Yeah, there's rain too. There's weather. Okay. I'm going to... Here's my approach.
[14668.67s -> 14687.10s]  Put down the anchor. There's a campfire right there. He's definitely right there. Oh, shit.
[14687.10s -> 14727.79s]  It's a crewmate. I have no stamina. Can I take this guy's shit? All right. Give me your sword.
[14727.79s -> 14736.70s]  Can I loot him? No, I can't. Okay. What? This guy's naked. This guy's naked. Wait. Why is there a
[14736.70s -> 14745.60s]  naked skeleton? Wait. What's going on? The other skeleton. The other guy had clothes on. Wait.
[14745.60s -> 14751.30s]  Chest. Chest or chest? Right here. Come on. Give me a weapon. Give me a sword. Something.
[14752.10s -> 14781.89s]  A thousand bucks. Get the fuck out of here. Leave me alone. Where the fuck are you running to? He's
[14781.89s -> 14789.78s]  got so much health. He's got way too much health. I'm going to drown him. Oh, the skeleton's going
[14789.78s -> 14814.38s]  to fight him? I have an idea. Did they not go in the water? I'm trying to drag him by his feet.
[14815.10s -> 14826.86s]  I'm going to run him over. I'm going to run his ass over. He's got... Look how many people he has.
[14826.86s -> 14858.35s]  This is ridiculous. Hit X to pull a weapon out? No, I don't have any weapons. No, I don't... Wait.
[14858.35s -> 14864.99s]  What? Do I... Was that actually a sword that I have in my inventory? Let's go. Come on. Where is it?
[14867.12s -> 14885.17s]  Don't even... All right. I'm dead. I died. Where do I spawn? Am I still on the island? I do have... I
[14885.17s -> 14890.43s]  have a sword. How do I take it out? All right. Let's go. I think I'm on the same... I think I'm
[14890.43s -> 14910.69s]  on the island still. Is there a map? Yep. I'm still on the island. All right. This guy's dead.
[14911.25s -> 14922.05s]  Is that a foam Minecraft sword or what? Am I going to be able to fight him?
[14941.07s -> 14950.78s]  He killed me again. It's made out of aluminum foil. Well, I'll kill him eventually. I get to keep
[14950.78s -> 14962.06s]  going back. I'll just... Okay. This is a spoiler for a very popular Marvel movie that I'm about
[14962.06s -> 14972.18s]  to spoil. There's a doctor in it. It's a... It's a movie about a doctor and he's weird. Okay.
[14976.85s -> 14981.09s]  I can just... I could just doormar move this guy, right? Like, doesn't matter. I'll come back over
[14981.09s -> 15022.53s]  and over again. Oh, no. I'm dead. Not Morbius. Doormamu. I'm here to bargain. Doormamu. I'm here
[15022.53s -> 15036.83s]  to bargain. Doormamu. R1M? R1? R1? Stop it. I got him. I win. I win. I got 10,000 fucking dollars.
[15036.83s -> 15050.05s]  Who cares if I lost 600? Are you kidding me? All right. Get out. Get out. Get out. What if I
[15050.05s -> 15056.26s]  lose a percentage? It's probably 20%. Yeah. Fuck all these doormamus. I don't care. I'm out.
[15057.98s -> 15082.24s]  This is my boat. Is that my boat? It's not. Well, it is now. Never mind. Where's my boat?
[15082.24s -> 15098.98s]  Is my boat gone? I don't see it anywhere. I think it's actually gone. No, that's not it. Wait. No,
[15098.98s -> 15116.75s]  it's over here. It's on the map. There it is. I wonder if he had any items. There's probably
[15116.75s -> 15128.35s]  stuff here to take, right? Maybe not. Okay. Well, I can buy a gun now. I at least need to see what
[15128.35s -> 15141.78s]  the gun is like. I'd rather watch you eat a jar of mayonnaise. You'd probably rather watch me eat a
[15141.78s -> 15155.23s]  jar of mayonnaise than a lot of stuff. I don't think it matters what we're doing. I think that
[15155.23s -> 15162.75s]  you would probably put that higher on the list because that's weird and crazy and you don't want
[15162.75s -> 15179.33s]  to miss that stream. All right. Uh, I need to get back to, what do I need to go? All right. That was
[15179.33s -> 15186.38s]  fun. That was good. That was called Pirates Bay. That was cool. It's like a single player pirate
[15186.38s -> 15198.21s]  adventure game. Pretty sick. Pretty sick. What else we got? What's the one that everybody keeps
[15198.29s -> 15203.84s]  to? I keep seeing it in chat. I keep seeing people saying this one, this one, this one,
[15203.84s -> 15221.55s]  something with an X in it. Slayers X. Is that on here? What, um, what category? Is it action,
[15221.55s -> 15240.62s]  adventure, simulation, RPG? What is it? Platformer? There's like, I guess I can just type it in. Okay,
[15240.62s -> 15266.42s]  Slayers X. Is this shooter? No, I'm not gonna play this Succubus game. Why would I do that?
[15266.42s -> 15299.18s]  They don't even tell me I'm having problems again with this. Why can't I download it?
[15299.18s -> 15322.78s]  Hold on. Let me try another one. Maintenance? No, it's not. They did maintenance yesterday.
[15322.78s -> 15343.47s]  It's not gonna happen again. What was the other one? What, Celico? Let me try that one. What is
[15343.47s -> 15378.67s]  all this about? This is weird. Um, I can't download anything. My Steam is like, fucked up. Well, um,
[15378.67s -> 15397.84s]  I guess I can open up the Dread X thing again. That's weird. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[15397.84s -> 15404.62s]  no, I can't download anything on Steam. Oh, wait. Yeah, I can. It just popped back up.
[15404.62s -> 15421.97s]  I think this is actually working. Dude, your chin is huge. Yeah. And guess what? If I have like,
[15421.97s -> 15436.24s]  in a fucking street fight, I just, it's like a bird beak hitting you right in the fucking mouth.
[15436.24s -> 15442.50s]  No, nevermind. I think Steam's fucked up. It looked like I could download it, but I can't.
[15442.50s -> 15449.33s]  Um, I can open Dread X. Play a couple more of those. I was not fair to the Dread X stuff before,
[15449.33s -> 15452.77s]  because I had the internet problems and I was annoyed and pissed off. So we can try some of
[15452.77s -> 15463.33s]  the Dread X stuff. That's sad because I, this is like over soon. All right. Well, whatever.
[15463.33s -> 15468.02s]  You're the comedy relief character that gets killed off. Yeah. Although I know they keep,
[15468.02s -> 15472.18s]  they kind of keep the comedy relief character around long enough to make jokes for the movie.
[15472.82s -> 15481.73s]  So I'd last a little while, I think. I think I'd last a little while.
[15482.37s -> 15491.90s]  Please do some of this stuff for green screen. All right. I'll do the go away,
[15491.90s -> 15497.70s]  go away thing. Are you guys going to have me like get attacked by a bear?
[15508.66s -> 15514.82s]  All right. Uh, let's go play this other thing over here. That was, that was creepy. I like that one.
[15516.62s -> 15522.83s]  They were all pretty good. Dread X. I love this. I love these little like micro games.
[15524.05s -> 15528.45s]  The demo stuff I love because it's like only 20, 30, 40 minutes an hour. It's perfect.
[15529.01s -> 15538.13s]  Tries to be demo Andy for the rest of my life. Okay. Um, let's get out of here.
[15538.85s -> 15549.89s]  What's the, the one that I have downloaded is that sell, sell it go. Let's see if it's any good.
[15549.89s -> 15555.73s]  How much longer are you going to stream? Probably not that much longer. And I really,
[15555.73s -> 15563.18s]  I'm going to disappoint a lot of people here. Unfortunately, I have a lot of stuff to do this
[15563.18s -> 15569.76s]  weekend and into this week. I told you I was going to be kind of erratic with the stream schedule.
[15569.76s -> 15573.65s]  You're not going to see me for a little while. You're not going to see me for like five or six
[15573.65s -> 15579.68s]  days or something. That's why I was so pissed off yesterday because I wanted to stream yesterday
[15579.68s -> 15583.04s]  because I knew I wanted to do two days in a row because I knew I wasn't going to be around.
[15583.04s -> 15588.54s]  That's why I was so mad yesterday afternoon. And I know my voice is junk. I know I'm very aware of
[15588.54s -> 15599.50s]  it. Let's do this though. Let's play this. Sell it go. Hopefully it's not too long.
[15602.99s -> 15609.68s]  Disappointed. What do you mean? Um, I just, I'm really trying to do more than a couple times a
[15609.68s -> 15622.96s]  week. What is this? This is a little, let me see. Okay. So here it is. Welcome to the steam next
[15622.96s -> 15628.99s]  fest demo. It means a lot to us to play this little game of ours. We hope you like it. It's
[15628.99s -> 15631.87s]  been developed for many years and it required a lot of hard work to get here to a point where
[15631.87s -> 15635.31s]  you can confidently hand out a free demo to you. While the development of this game is a lot of
[15635.31s -> 15640.91s]  fun, complete do-overs for the entire game were frequently made. And it took a while till we
[15640.91s -> 15644.27s]  finally had something that we truly believed in. Something that made us go, this is the game that
[15644.27s -> 15650.38s]  I want to spend the next couple of years on. Very fair. Oh, it had a different name. Okay.
[15654.61s -> 15661.68s]  Game's unfinished. The demo has been significantly altered and that's it. Okay. It's a work in
[15661.68s -> 15668.72s]  progress. Yeah. Okay. I get it. Adjust the graphics. Be based on your heart. Please select one of the
[15668.72s -> 15679.38s]  answers below. I have a state of the art gaming PC. 3090. Oh, I thought the game crashed.
[15679.38s -> 15702.77s]  This is Celico. Press any key. Friendly reminder that you have previously set one or more graphics
[15702.77s -> 15709.38s]  to ridiculous. Please be aware that this setting is not optimized for any computer and may cause
[15709.38s -> 15722.94s]  performance and visibility issues. So maybe I should change it. I'll go ahead and change it.
[15728.83s -> 15755.31s]  What a streamer mode. Really? Wow. Reduce screen shake. That's a plus one for me.
[15757.15s -> 15760.83s]  Avoid compression issues. That's a lot of thought that went into that. That's cool.
[15762.43s -> 15765.47s]  I'm going to have to put, okay, yeah, let's do this. Let's put this on just high.
[15766.51s -> 15778.34s]  Where's ridiculous. Okay. Real-time ground ceiling reflections, mirror reflections. That's cool.
[15779.30s -> 15787.73s]  All right. Decal quality. High level of detail. Ultra. I think that's fine.
[15788.53s -> 15795.22s]  It told me not to do this because it's literally impossible for a computer. Sounding things in a
[15795.22s -> 15809.78s]  good spot. Dude, I got it. Okay. Let's give a round of applause. Having a shitload of options,
[15810.83s -> 15816.91s]  even if nobody touches it, is such a huge deal because they might be something that you really
[15816.99s -> 15824.14s]  don't like in a game that you can never take out. But when you have the option to take something out,
[15826.67s -> 15833.84s]  it's just better. Don't applaud it yet. You didn't try it. Hold on. Look at all this stuff.
[15833.84s -> 15839.18s]  Let's see some gameplay. All right. Let's see some gameplay. Let's see some gameplay. Fine.
[15840.32s -> 15870.40s]  Okay. Shouldn't these be the same? Shouldn't these be the same? Horizontal and vertical?
[15871.12s -> 15885.28s]  Not in this game. Really? Huh? Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's see some gameplay. Ensign.
[15885.28s -> 15892.45s]  Lieutenant. Commander. Well, new lieutenant. All right. Here we go. Just play the game. I'm
[15892.45s -> 15898.99s]  just making sure I get it in the right spot. Choose your play style. Well, just a traditional
[15900.59s -> 15909.58s]  rifle. Start each level with only an assault rifle. There's glowing eyes behind you.
[15909.58s -> 15916.75s]  Steam Dome for Celica provides an early look at the game while it's still in development.
[15916.75s -> 15921.87s]  Most story elements will be absent until a later demo update. When's the game actually come out?
[15921.87s -> 15965.18s]  Is there a date? Grab teddy bear. Notepad. Do I have a gun? Evade soldiers and locate a weapon.
[15965.18s -> 15980.62s]  Oh. Lock purple door. Add it to auto. What? Okay. Oh, this is fast. Anything in the trash?
[15981.34s -> 16027.07s]  I can jump? We're in space? All right. Cool. All right. Where do I go? Oh, right here.
[16027.07s -> 16048.77s]  Right here. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[16049.65s -> 16063.38s]  I need a gun. I need a gun. I need a gun. Gun, gun, gun, gun. Right now. Gun, gun, gun. I need a gun.
[16064.02s -> 16121.41s]  Press E to pick it up. Gun. Gun. Whoa. That animation is cool. The reload animation. It's
[16121.41s -> 16127.09s]  like the FPS is low. It's weird. I like it. I like the reload animation.
[16127.49s -> 16151.26s]  All the animations are interesting. It feels like, um, I'm on just the normal difficulty.
[16151.26s -> 16159.22s]  It feels like, um, like Doom, but it's, it's like a 3D, much cleaner and better looking.
[16159.22s -> 16172.29s]  That's weird. Hard to describe. Oh, there's the key. This was, oh, this was a Doom mod. That's right.
[16172.29s -> 16192.74s]  Holy shit. I read that in the beginning. Data card. Codex. You can now use your wrist codecs
[16192.74s -> 16198.42s]  by pressing caps lock. Powerful information tool. Download a data pad. Contents. All right, cool.
[16201.84s -> 16222.32s]  Well, I think I need that. All right. Uh, one, four, three, two. This game is called
[16222.32s -> 16235.71s]  Celico. S-E-L-A-C-O. Add it to your wish list for the love of God. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Don't,
[16235.71s -> 16253.73s]  I don't want to use all my weapons. What's this? Um, oh, it's new info. Cool. So what's the objective
[16253.73s -> 16269.79s]  now? Incoming message. Slide attack. Okay. Nice. All right. Where's, where am I going?
[16279.04s -> 16305.15s]  Cool. All right. Watch out. Don't die. I'm going to, I have one health.
[16309.87s -> 16369.23s]  The enemies are 2D. Cool. Cool. Okay. Back here. More data. What do I do? Door unlocked. Oh,
[16369.79s -> 16378.14s]  oh, you need a cheeseburger. That's cool. Oh, I'm so hungry. Oh my God. I want a cheeseburger. So bad.
[16378.14s -> 16404.05s]  I need a burger right now. Can this open? Eat a whopper? No, I'm not into that right now. Um,
[16404.05s -> 16453.92s]  I went, I'm going backwards a lot. That's a long slide. Challenges. Okay. Cool. Armor lost. Uh,
[16453.92s -> 16463.31s]  this game gets like a five at a five for style. And I mean like a one for gameplay. Cause like,
[16463.31s -> 16473.86s]  how would I have died there? That's impossible. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's cool. Uh, this is
[16473.94s -> 16496.03s]  absolutely fine. I love the 2D, 3D. It's so weird. It reminds me of one time I was on family guy.
[16496.03s -> 16534.27s]  What these are slow down, slow down. You made my paper shredder overheat. Why? I didn't,
[16534.83s -> 16543.18s]  I didn't overload your paper shredder. You do up to six sheets at a time. Don't be dumb and do more
[16543.18s -> 16552.00s]  than six sheets. That's the thing that you did. And I know you did, you did like seven or eight
[16552.00s -> 16556.08s]  sheets. You said, ah, well, I don't feel like sitting here and doing six at a time. Fuck it.
[16557.47s -> 16587.30s]  And it went, and then you look like a fool. I mean, it was foolish what you did on lock.
[16621.98s -> 16645.63s]  Lockdown active. Where should I go from here? Somebody's shooting at me from her. This is
[16645.63s -> 16662.78s]  absolutely fucking insane to do. Jeezy doom. What's, what's Jeezy doom is it's just the doom
[16662.78s -> 16670.78s]  engine. Now, wait, wait, wait. Are we talking to the original doom? Just doom one, just doom
[16671.58s -> 16690.51s]  for the Amiga. What? That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense. This, this, this is,
[16690.51s -> 16697.34s]  how does that make any sense? That's crazy. Can I get in here?
[16697.34s -> 16710.86s]  I can go in there. Hold on. What about over here? I did this. I did that. I'm missing a door or
[16710.86s -> 16721.18s]  something. Well, that's insane. That's remarkable. That's really, really cool. Where's this door? I
[16721.18s -> 16727.97s]  know I'm lost. I know, I know, I know, I know. A key or something. Do I need to open it with
[16727.97s -> 16732.86s]  something? Wow. Where do I go? There's a light behind you. Yeah, I know. It's called a lamp.
[16733.74s -> 16743.01s]  Well, he's only it's this place is in lockdown. Wait, that doesn't mean anything. No, I'm fine.
[16743.01s -> 16755.90s]  What? It's in the middle of the room. Oh, got it. I thought I was just looking for a door.
[16761.31s -> 16765.87s]  That made that makes a lot more sense now that I'm playing this, that this is doom,
[16765.87s -> 16807.50s]  that they just have heavily changed. Happy birthday. Wait, that's who's that? That's me.
[16813.70s -> 16863.79s]  Jesus. Whoa, wait, what? Oh, dude, you should play frog monster. I already did. That game was sick.
[16870.85s -> 16884.85s]  All right. Where should I go from here? Oh, my goodness. I can't tell that was a bad or a good
[16884.85s -> 16909.34s]  idea. I think it was a good idea. What? Where am I? W. Do I have a flashlight? Oh, my God,
[16909.34s -> 16948.05s]  I'm going to drown. Wait, wasn't I up here already? No, I do have a flashlight. All right, good.
[16948.05s -> 16987.94s]  Come get me. Blue cake. Security level three. Camera feeds. It's a lot going on in this game.
[16988.58s -> 16998.32s]  There's a lot going on. That was just a Roomba, but I don't care. It was on the enemy team.
[16999.04s -> 17045.52s]  No. Crap. Use Z for med kit. Oh, my God. I'm dumb. Is there a map? I actually don't know. There might
[17045.52s -> 17054.70s]  be. Your room is really dumb. Yeah, because I was playing scary games earlier and here we are.
[17055.26s -> 17062.96s]  All right. One more attempt and that's it. Then I'm going to call it. I just, I mean, I need a
[17062.96s -> 17067.04s]  cheeseburger. It's so bad. It's like the only thing I care about right now. It's the number one thing
[17067.04s -> 17092.67s]  I care about. Perfect timing. I'm exhausted. Hopefully get some rest. Rest up. Yeah.
[17093.55s -> 17124.90s]  Get some rest. Why not? Those guys hurt a lot. Oh, God. I didn't know you were still here.
[17126.90s -> 17136.48s]  I got to go get some meat in me. I got to get some beef with lettuce. What's my special order?
[17136.48s -> 17161.76s]  My special order. Why am I still moving around? Lettuce. No, jalapenos, grilled onions,
[17163.06s -> 17178.13s]  A1 steak sauce. And that's it. Cheese, grilled onions, jalapenos, A1 steak sauce. Let's get it.
[17182.50s -> 17188.62s]  Oh, an A1 steak sauce. Let's get it. I guess I'm fucking tired.
[17191.23s -> 17197.55s]  Guys, I only put A1 steak sauce on a cheeseburger. That's it. It never goes on anything else.
[17201.06s -> 17205.14s]  I've never had A1 on anything besides a burger. Sometimes when I order a burger,
[17206.02s -> 17219.23s]  they just rename it A1 burger sauce because that's where it belongs. I don't put it on everything.
[17219.23s -> 17226.00s]  I don't put it on everything. No, that'd be gross. All right. That's going to conclude the stream and
[17226.00s -> 17235.65s]  I will see you guys later. Celico. That was really cool. The fact that that's done in a Doom mod
[17236.29s -> 17244.82s]  seems impossible. And that's what makes it so cool. A lot of fun games today. I like this. I don't
[17245.14s -> 17251.98s]  maybe even if it goes away, I might still do it. So you guys, the next time you guys are going to
[17251.98s -> 17263.62s]  see me, let me see. Let me check here. It's probably going to be, I just have, there's a lot going on.
[17263.62s -> 17269.57s]  I'll be back in a week. I want to stream. I really want to. I don't want to just leave.
[17270.21s -> 17277.12s]  I'm just like not stream for like a week, but probably the 23rd or the 24th. And then after
[17277.12s -> 17288.50s]  that, I can promise you that I will be back. No more seven day breaks. So trust me, I want to,
[17288.50s -> 17299.06s]  I want to be hanging out, but there's a lot of cool stuff that's going to be happening soon.
[17299.06s -> 17318.27s]  Stuff that I'm very excited for. Is there any IRL stuff? Yes, there is. I've got some IRL stuff
[17318.27s -> 17325.15s]  that I need to take care of as well as a ton of stream stuff. Baseball is in kind of crunch time
[17325.15s -> 17330.05s]  right now, but I'm going to have so much fun with that. That's going to be some of the,
[17330.05s -> 17336.29s]  oh, I can't wait. I've been waiting like two years to do that, but everything's good.
[17336.29s -> 17346.00s]  Everything's fine. Don't worry. When I say IRL stuff, it's not, it's everything's fine. Don't
[17346.00s -> 17368.72s]  worry. There's just a ton of things I have to get done. The baseball stream is going to be the first
[17368.72s -> 17375.73s]  first sports event I'm actually going to watch. It's going to be interesting. I will promise you
[17375.73s -> 17386.11s]  that it'll be interesting. Yeah. I'll see you guys in a week. Don't forget about me. I look back. I
[17386.11s -> 17396.16s]  promise. Thanks for watching. Thanks for the subs. Thanks for the raid. There was a couple of raids
[17396.16s -> 17407.97s]  today, right? Or hosts. It's late pretty much anywhere around the world right now. Get some
[17407.97s -> 17419.15s]  sleep. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother, you know, the usual. Have a great night guys.
[17423.70s -> 17432.24s]  See you soon. Oh, and by the way, when I, when I stream again, I'm going to have a ton of dates
[17432.96s -> 17436.72s]  for you guys to mark down. Green screen will have one. Baseball is locked in for the 20th,
[17436.72s -> 17442.24s]  by the way. I want to make sure I make that clear. July 20th. It's not July 14th anymore.
[17442.24s -> 17447.68s]  We had to do a bunch of stuff with the venue. So that's July 20th. It had to move about six
[17447.68s -> 17457.65s]  days later. I might even actually be able to announce the other project, which that would be
[17457.65s -> 17466.34s]  exciting too. I would love to be able to announce the other project. I feel like it's going to be
[17466.34s -> 17541.44s]  a lot of fun, but good night guys. See you soon. Have a good week. I'll be back. Take care. Goodbye.
