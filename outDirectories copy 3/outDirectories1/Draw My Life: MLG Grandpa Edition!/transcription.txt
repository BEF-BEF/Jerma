[0.31s -> 16.08s]  Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here. You haven't seen me in a while, but you know what? Fuck you.
[16.08s -> 22.08s]  We're going to do something today that I've been seeing on the internet for a while, and it's draw my thing.
[22.08s -> 30.56s]  No, it's my life. Draw my life. It's where you draw pictures. Just draw pictures of your life from when you were a baby,
[30.56s -> 33.56s]  and you tell a story about how you were born and stuff.
[33.56s -> 39.56s]  And I figured that you would want to know this because I'm the most important person in your life, so here we go.
[39.56s -> 51.23s]  Ahem. So the story of my life goes like this. I was born Hilfred J. Steelehelm, the strongest baby on Earth.
[51.23s -> 59.47s]  And that's because Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all had sex with each other, and I was the resulting baby.
[60.78s -> 72.14s]  Get mad. Get jealous, bro. It was a tough life being a super baby sidekick, going on adventures, saving lives, until it would depress.
[72.14s -> 81.14s]  But I loved it. We were all such a happy family until one day my parents died on a roller coaster ride.
[81.14s -> 88.14s]  And I died too. I forgot that part. And in heaven, God told me I had a bigger purpose.
[88.14s -> 95.14s]  He said, I'm going to give you mortality and send you back to Earth to solve the world's problems.
[95.14s -> 106.38s]  And I said, OK, send me back Roger that. And I arrived in a basket at the Denver School for Baby Ninja Frog People.
[106.38s -> 115.38s]  And I befriended the frogs. And they said, thank you. And I said, except for one frog named Timmy. He used to make fun of me.
[115.38s -> 121.38s]  I killed him. He's dead. He's been dead for 70 years. Holy shit, has it really been that long?
[121.38s -> 128.74s]  Let me look at my calendar here. It is. There's German's birth. There's my birthday.
[128.74s -> 135.92s]  Well, really, it's been like 82 years since I killed Timmy. Hope his parents aren't that mad at me. Whatever. Let's get back into this.
[135.92s -> 145.16s]  So I got a job selling old shoes or you can put whatever you want here, because I didn't have a job for the last like probably 40 years.
[145.16s -> 151.16s]  I got a job at the fishing dock. I was the guy that peeled all the fish's scales off. I used to eat them.
[151.16s -> 158.85s]  It might be weird to a lot of you guys, but do you think I give a fuck? And then came my adult life.
[158.85s -> 172.33s]  You've never seen quite an action packed adventure like this one. Gather your friends and explore the wonderful land of Azeroth.
[172.33s -> 178.95s]  I actually don't remember half of my adult life, so I just read the back of the Warcraft box.
[178.95s -> 189.50s]  So my death was on June 24th, 2002. I fell out of an airplane and Insta-died on the concrete.
[189.50s -> 197.50s]  Made my way back into heaven. And here's the funny story, guys. I was in Moses's science class. And guess who sits behind me but God himself.
[197.50s -> 204.50s]  I walked up to him after class at his locker and I just simply asked him, God, you know, could I have like five more years on Earth?
[204.50s -> 213.17s]  And I had to trade my fucking Lunchables for it. But I'm here. And it's, wait a second, 2002, three, four, five, six, seven.
[213.17s -> 223.47s]  I should have, I should be, I should have died in 2007. What the fuck is going on? Wait a minute. Is it 2007 right now?
[223.47s -> 228.68s]  Jeremy! Jeremy, come down here for a second.
[228.68s -> 231.94s]  What? What do you want?
[231.94s -> 234.94s]  What's a year today? Like, what, 2005?
[234.94s -> 236.94s]  It's 2013, grandpa.
[236.94s -> 238.94s]  2013!
[238.94s -> 239.94s]  Jesus.
[239.94s -> 241.94s]  I'm supposed to be dead!
[241.94s -> 242.94s]  Dead? What?
[242.94s -> 250.94s]  Oh, hold on a minute. Call your mother. Call your mother. We gotta, she will see some fucking warlock that set all this up.
