[1.46s -> 18.17s]  I'm back. I'm here. I made it. The internet works. Stream is bopping. I can feel the energy.
[18.17s -> 25.32s]  It's time for the movies. I've been waiting for this like three days. The internet has been fixed.
[25.88s -> 36.23s]  I've been assured of that. We've done a lot of testing. Almost no drop frames in the last
[36.23s -> 42.86s]  probably 12 to 15 hours. That's pretty good. That's the green light. Now if we get a red light here,
[44.28s -> 48.84s]  then that's, I mean, that's not fair. But you kind of have to do what you do.
[49.64s -> 59.58s]  Are you talking to me? Yeah. But anyways, this room has been set up for the last three days to do this.
[60.22s -> 62.78s]  And I've been really excited to do this because this game looks really fun.
[63.90s -> 79.29s]  Looks like a good time. Get this out of the way. So everything gets zapped on like a monthly basis
[79.29s -> 86.22s]  here. And it's very frustrating. Can I just say? I mean, you guys know this. But I'm ready.
[86.86s -> 99.38s]  I'm not going to wait anymore. This is ready to go. Want me to prove it? Take a look at this shit.
[99.94s -> 108.84s]  All right. We're going to test. We're going to make sure it's synced up correctly. Yes,
[108.84s -> 112.68s]  I'm wearing a wire. I'm sure you've been aware of that. And it's frame ready or what?
[113.40s -> 125.78s]  Okay. I'm in my workout gear. That's an Xbox live vision camera. They don't make these anymore. You
[125.78s -> 130.66s]  have to buy them from third party sellers. I bought two of them just in case the price goes up.
[133.35s -> 136.47s]  And of course, I've got my cocktail table over here.
[137.19s -> 145.37s]  Currently doing a Bay Breeze. If you don't know what that is. Look it up. It's tasty. Metal straw.
[145.37s -> 157.38s]  Yeah. It's better that way. It's colder. See? What is this? You'll find out. You'll find out
[157.38s -> 165.62s]  real soon. All right. So let's just do it. Let me get, let me get locked in. You can't even
[165.62s -> 170.90s]  hear the music is fucking awesome. There. Now you can hear it. We've got to sync this up. Make
[170.90s -> 178.65s]  sure. Can you see my mouth move when my mouth moves? One, two, three, four. Hey, we got a green
[178.65s -> 190.63s]  screen back here. Let's add some footage right now. Here we go. I'm in a car now. Take that one,
[190.63s -> 202.79s]  put it somewhere. I don't know. How about this one? He's riding a horse. Use it. Use any of this.
[203.43s -> 214.87s]  Who cares? That's two extra bonus clips that you didn't have before. All right. What do you say?
[214.87s -> 232.87s]  The sink is off. Ready? Here we go. Did you hear that? Hey, hey, it's off. What? How off is it?
[235.93s -> 238.49s]  All right. Can you hear my voice first or hear my voice later?
[239.66s -> 248.87s]  And this is very important. My audio is early. You hear it. You hear them. Okay. Hold on. Wait,
[248.87s -> 264.92s]  wait, wait. So if I'm early, shit. Hold on. If I'm early, how about up? Ready? Oh, hold up. Ready?
[266.92s -> 283.51s]  How was that? Better? Let's try. Good. To the music, to the beat. It's got to be to the beat.
[283.51s -> 296.06s]  It's important. Yeah. All right. Good. Let's go. Is it in focus? This is on the Xbox 360,
[296.06s -> 298.62s]  by the way. They don't make these anymore. They don't even make Xboxes anymore.
[299.50s -> 307.24s]  Are we in focus? Yes. Is the lighting okay in here? Check the light meter to be sure.
[308.52s -> 312.78s]  It's a little out of the green. Now it's still in the green. That's all right. It's okay.
[314.87s -> 319.99s]  Now let's position the camera. Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the
[319.99s -> 326.15s]  outline without appearing too small or too big. If you find that anyone is too short or too tall
[326.15s -> 334.71s]  to fit in, tilt the camera up or down and try again. Welcome to the cut out studio. This is
[334.71s -> 343.19s]  why we separate your image from the background. Select start. Great. Please move out of the picture
[343.19s -> 352.46s]  while we scan the background. Please hold on. Cut out complete. Now get back in front of the
[352.46s -> 358.38s]  camera. Try playing around with the cut out style to see the best results. That's so bad.
[358.38s -> 367.46s]  Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background? What do you guys think? Four? I
[367.46s -> 375.16s]  think four looks good. Four has a little bit of haze on it though. One is bad. Two is worse. Three
[375.16s -> 382.98s]  is okay. Four is haze. I don't know if I like four. Which one? You tell me, right?
[388.71s -> 415.56s]  Shit! This is two. This is three. Who is three? I'll give you a lefty. No, it's okay.
[416.74s -> 422.42s]  We need to be trained at a very young age to use both of our hands and arms. Because seriously,
[422.42s -> 427.46s]  take a look at this. Ready? I'm going to show you. Ready? Watch this. Boom! You're gone. Right?
[427.46s -> 434.68s]  Have you come from over here? Have you come from that one? You're gonna laugh. I can't defend
[434.68s -> 439.90s]  off an attacker that way. Why can nobody use... We need to be taught at a young age to use both
[439.90s -> 449.82s]  of our hands. I can't... Throwing a ball like this is like... Throwing a ball like this, I can fucking...
[449.82s -> 461.26s]  I can go 100. All right. Two looks good. I'm already winded. This might be a quick one.
[462.44s -> 466.44s]  I've been waiting fucking three days to do this and I'm already like,
[466.44s -> 474.86s]  oh, I threw four punches. It's time to go home. All right. No, no, no. Two is fine.
[476.30s -> 481.43s]  One's actually not that bad either. I'll go two. Two is fine.
[482.47s -> 489.16s]  How many actors are there? Choose the correct number. I could do this one, but not yet.
[490.20s -> 500.12s]  Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play
[500.12s -> 508.78s]  in the movie. No, no, no, no. I want a new picture. Step into one of the four outlines
[508.78s -> 516.14s]  for your picture. This will decide which role you play in the movie. That's scary. Oh, I know.
[517.42s -> 523.75s]  Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play
[523.75s -> 529.30s]  in the movie. Why am I so scary looking? I just ripped out the fucking cord. I don't care.
[530.26s -> 537.24s]  Hold on. I have to connect my fucking wire. Player one, get your butt on the set.
[539.91s -> 551.46s]  This is me? Dodge the arms and strike the targets. Yeah, I tested this one. Pretend you're in a dojo
[551.46s -> 557.30s]  preparing for a big fight. Avoid the arms of the training dummy and hit the targets to score.
[558.26s -> 560.10s]  Anytime you look at somebody from the side, it's just like, oh.
[560.10s -> 573.85s]  Action. You fight like a master. That's smart. Right on target. You're getting the beating.
[575.56s -> 582.18s]  What a what? What's happening in the corner? What's that? That showed the dummy.
[583.06s -> 590.90s]  That's gonna hurt tomorrow. Take that, dummy. Always use the paw. Ouch. I bet you won't.
[590.90s -> 597.54s]  Always use the paw. That one was angry. Right here. Ouch. That's smart. They look like Nick
[597.54s -> 615.61s]  Arcade. Revenge. Crushing blow. Got it. You just beat the heck out of Bruce Lee there.
[619.26s -> 629.40s]  That wasn't bad. Player one, come to the set, please. I broke the fucking audio. And now
[629.40s -> 634.92s]  it's your time to shine. What do I do? Just follow my instructions and act like a star.
[635.08s -> 643.48s]  Okay. Give me your most evil laugh. When? Now? Action.
[646.68s -> 658.58s]  Come on. That was fantastic. Oh, okay. Got it. You were a star. That's it. All right. Let's go.
[659.99s -> 673.34s]  Star. I look like a fucking character from The Office. I'm doing like a look in the camera.
[673.98s -> 682.74s]  Can you believe what Steve Carell just said? Player one, you need it on set.
[683.14s -> 692.70s]  What's next? Throw the log as far. All right. I can move my right hand. Throw the log.
[694.06s -> 700.54s]  Make like you're at the Highland Games in the Kavatoss event. Throw that pesky log as far as you
[700.54s -> 733.74s]  can. Action. Was that 650? That wasn't bad. That's kind of far. Again. 200. Wait, I gotta be like in
[734.46s -> 748.25s]  it's kind of quick. Good throwing. That log sure won't bother us again.
[748.25s -> 751.53s]  I thought it was going to be like a situation where you just have to get the thing, the pixel
[751.53s -> 757.72s]  to touch quick. Player one, get yourself to the set. Don't worry. That's me. I know where
[757.72s -> 766.50s]  I'm supposed to be right here. And now it's your time to shine. Just follow my instructions
[766.66s -> 780.66s]  and act like you're a star. Show me fury. And action. Keep it up.
[784.07s -> 802.68s]  That was fantastic. You were a star. All right. I'm good. Imagine like looking into my window right
[802.68s -> 814.73s]  now. What am I practicing for? What is that person doing? Because there is no logical explanation
[814.73s -> 823.19s]  as to why somebody would be standing in their room doing this. I'm like hacking myself up for
[823.19s -> 832.36s]  what? Like a conference? Look at how red my face is. I didn't realize how hot it was going to be in
[832.36s -> 838.12s]  here. What am I? Okay. Pretend like you are a treasure hunter. Pull on the rope before the
[838.12s -> 845.18s]  time runs out to get the treasure. I'm like as red as the snow. I'm not, am I? Action. What?
[846.06s -> 864.17s]  I'm not very good at this, am I? Holy shit, I'm turning like green. I'm not this red.
[866.58s -> 875.19s]  Am I this red? What's happening? I'm like, I swear to God, this is like, this is like bizarre.
[875.83s -> 887.66s]  It's the camera. I'm turning into a Willy Wonka character. I have a sunburn.
[888.30s -> 898.34s]  Oh. What the fuck? No, no. I got to like, it's 110 degrees in Vegas right now. What the fuck
[898.34s -> 910.60s]  was I thinking? Get the ball in the hole three times. Hey, let me do this like, this is like,
[910.60s -> 916.49s]  oh, I got to shoot the basket. I'm not really, I'm not this red. Look and see, I'm not that red.
[916.49s -> 923.75s]  Where's the basket? Where's the ball? What? I don't know. Oh, that was close, but no cigar.
[923.75s -> 939.96s]  Oh, okay. Got it. Two. Only one more left. Shit. You can do better than that. Get in there.
[940.92s -> 952.90s]  Come on, sink the ball into the hole. We have a winner, ladies and gentlemen. By the way,
[952.90s -> 959.35s]  at the end of this, it cuts up a trailer. That's wonderful. With like three other random actors
[959.35s -> 971.98s]  that aren't in this house. That's a wrap. That's a wrap. Let's see. Are you ready? I'm ready.
[981.58s -> 987.06s]  Play every character. That's, that's kind of the idea. I have like four costumes here.
[989.27s -> 992.47s]  It's gonna be fucking impossible. I'm going to be like purple at the end of this.
[1004.10s -> 1016.84s]  Everyone's super. Every superhero's super. But some are more super than others.
[1016.92s -> 1037.90s]  Go on. And where there are heroes, there are villains, battles, adventure, breathtaking effects.
[1040.73s -> 1046.41s]  Not a silly costume in sight. Why am I in the Bowser plane? Ever wanted to wear your underpants
[1046.41s -> 1056.71s]  over your trousers? Rippling muscles. Astounding abilities. Fiercer than a ranting mom.
[1056.71s -> 1065.85s]  More courageous than a hungry mouse. Faster than waiting for a bus.
[1069.46s -> 1074.34s]  So when you're feeling low, remember everyone's super.
[1079.78s -> 1089.59s]  No, I don't want to replay that. Why do they have to be red? Oh, okay. No, I don't. Would
[1089.59s -> 1096.68s]  you like to save your movie? No. Why would I want to save this fucking movie? That was awful.
[1097.56s -> 1104.34s]  Save it. Who cares? Who cares?
[1111.83s -> 1116.23s]  That was a test. I was testing the program for that one to make sure it worked.
[1119.46s -> 1140.42s]  I would just. J1. Who cares who? Nah, you guys ain't ever gonna see who cares what.
[1141.38s -> 1150.82s]  That's for me. That's a private showing only. That's only for me. I think I'm pretty sure I
[1150.82s -> 1158.81s]  was naked. Here's the thing, guys. I cannot be 100% certain that I am not 100% underwear
[1158.81s -> 1167.53s]  naked in that video. I don't know. I can't turn that on. I was testing it just to test the lighting
[1167.53s -> 1180.60s]  in the room. This was two or three days ago. That may as well be three years ago. This takes a long
[1180.60s -> 1191.43s]  time. Damn. He's testing the lighting in the room. What breed of dog is Otto? He's a dachshund,
[1191.43s -> 1205.99s]  actually. Remind me never to save a movie ever again. What do the aliens in the teen sci-fi flick
[1205.99s -> 1214.18s]  the faculty need most for survival? I was gonna say sugar. Which ape leads the first
[1214.18s -> 1225.83s]  ape rebellion and conquest of the planet of the apes? I don't know. Caesar. In The Princess
[1225.83s -> 1241.53s]  Bride, what word does Miracle Max hate to hear? Yeah. From 1996, Romeo and Juliet took a year
[1241.53s -> 1251.13s]  off from Yale to film Terminator 3. Claire Danes, that's the one. 2008's The Dark Knight is a sequel
[1251.13s -> 1261.08s]  to which film? Batman Again. I got it. I told you. I know what I'm doing. I know my movie trivia.
[1261.80s -> 1268.44s]  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen act together in this 2004 film. Freaky Friday. No, no, no, no, no.
[1271.16s -> 1278.09s]  Jennifer Lopez and Woody Allen provided voices for what animated insect film? Beam Movie.
[1278.73s -> 1304.79s]  Let's never do that again. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the You're in the Movies Awards.
[1305.67s -> 1313.61s]  Awards? Yeah. And now the moment you've all been waiting for. Nobody's seen the movie yet. The
[1313.61s -> 1326.86s]  nominees for best actor are. Nominee one. Nominee two. Random dropper's license image two.
[1327.66s -> 1342.58s]  Nominee three. Nominee four. But of course, there can only be one winner. And the You're in
[1342.58s -> 1357.13s]  the Movies Award for best actor goes to. Yes. Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious
[1357.13s -> 1363.69s]  award. Perhaps you'd like to say a few words. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. I'm
[1363.77s -> 1368.89s]  glad everybody liked the trailer. The movie ain't out yet. You have to go see it still.
[1369.53s -> 1373.69s]  But I really appreciate the support nonetheless. Make sure to go see it next year when it comes out.
[1374.97s -> 1380.73s]  Have a great evening. Make sure to tweet at tip your waiters and waitresses. And I'm out.
[1393.77s -> 1405.40s]  Guns cold blooded. A spillage in a lab transformed a lizard into a monster,
[1405.40s -> 1410.84s]  causing panic and havoc. Let's check our equipment is working correctly.
[1410.84s -> 1420.42s]  Is the picture in focus? Is the lighting okay in here? Check the light meter to be sure.
[1420.42s -> 1428.66s]  There's 110 degrees in Vegas right now. This sun is just beaming in here. This fucking shitty
[1428.66s -> 1438.50s]  webcam from like 1998. This beaming sun. That's why I'm like turning red.
[1439.78s -> 1446.68s]  Can't hear me. I'm saying that it's be the sun is beaming in here.
[1447.48s -> 1455.16s]  I'm gonna turn the music down. Thanks for the reminder. All right, light looks fine.
[1456.26s -> 1462.10s]  Now let's position the camera. Make sure everyone can fit. I'm not going down that line
[1462.10s -> 1466.66s]  without appearing too small. People will do like a thing. Oh, look at the thing on the ground.
[1467.46s -> 1473.06s]  It's six feet tall. Therefore he's triangulated. He's fine too. I've seen that fucking joke a
[1473.06s -> 1484.31s]  thousand times. It's not going to be an original joke. Welcome to the cut out studio. This is where
[1484.31s -> 1491.32s]  we separate your image. Great. Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.
[1492.79s -> 1500.76s]  Please hold on. Cut out complete. Now get back in front of the camera. That was scary because I
[1500.76s -> 1508.04s]  have a big shadow on my face. And I've got a real angular face. Like every single like you could
[1508.04s -> 1513.08s]  you could like get shade over here in my like angular fucking face. You know what I'm saying?
[1513.80s -> 1526.44s]  Two, uh, two is fine, right? Yeah. It's going to change a little bit as the light changes.
[1526.44s -> 1535.46s]  No, that's good. That's fine. How many actors are there? Choose the correct number. All right,
[1535.46s -> 1538.90s]  here's where I'm going to, I'm going to add an actor. I'm going to add an actor.
[1540.79s -> 1549.05s]  Step into one of the scientists and civilian. This will decide which role you play in the movie.
[1550.01s -> 1553.85s]  That person, I love how he's two. No, I'm going to start with two.
[1556.81s -> 1562.82s]  Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play
[1562.82s -> 1567.70s]  in the movie. That's two. That's how I know that's two. No, no, no. I want a civilian.
[1569.14s -> 1576.57s]  Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play
[1576.57s -> 1582.44s]  in the movie. All right, let's go. Scientists, civilian. So I got to remember that because I
[1582.44s -> 1586.36s]  got, I've got some, I got some wardrobe changes like a big girl on the fly. I'm happy with those.
[1587.16s -> 1596.98s]  Who's up first? So we've got me. We've got another actor. So that bathrobe guy is going to be a
[1596.98s -> 1603.26s]  player too. Why don't I even have this in my hand? Go into the obstacles and hit the jumps
[1604.78s -> 1611.02s]  in a car. Drive your scooter through town, dodge the obstacles, but hit the ramps to score.
[1612.22s -> 1616.58s]  Okay. I shouldn't have wore the red shirt. People would not even be commenting on my life.
[1619.34s -> 1640.38s]  I can't even see that far. Is that a jump? I should be reacting, shouldn't I? All right.
[1640.86s -> 1650.20s]  Like, whoops, whoops, whoops.
[1672.58s -> 1684.07s]  Ghost rides it over the finish line. What a fucking probe. Player two to the set.
[1684.87s -> 1698.23s]  Pretend that you're surrounded by hornets. Swat those suckers before they sting you.
[1698.95s -> 1706.47s]  Action. Get these things away from me.
[1708.47s -> 1712.55s]  Sayonara, Stripey. Take them down.
[1714.55s -> 1731.40s]  These fuckers, they sting. One to swat. You sure can swat. All right. Play one.
[1732.12s -> 1756.79s]  Who's turn? Oh, I'm competing against myself. How is that any better? Players one and two.
[1757.35s -> 1766.34s]  What? What do you mean two? Both of us? That means I have to be like, what? This is
[1766.34s -> 1772.44s]  called, this is both of us. Let's all do the conga. Hit the drums as fast as you can to make
[1772.44s -> 1779.46s]  the monkey dance faster. Shit. Okay. I thought we were going to be, see, okay, there we go.
[1780.42s -> 1798.79s]  It's two of, it's both of us. And action. Dance monkey boy. Get that monkey go.
[1799.67s -> 1810.60s]  What happens if there's four people on the screen? Player one, get your butt on the set.
[1815.16s -> 1822.17s]  Okay, I'm ready. It's me. It's time to put you in the spotlight. There's no scoring.
[1822.17s -> 1828.01s]  Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent. What is with that? There's like a spot
[1828.01s -> 1839.74s]  on, wipe it off. Action. Wipe that shit off. Come on. Show me what you got. This is not how
[1839.74s -> 1854.87s]  people walk. Right. Now try this. Do it again. As confused as you can. And action. More feeling.
[1855.67s -> 1865.61s]  Put more feeling into it. Let's do another. Give me a look of absolute terror. Go this way.
[1875.26s -> 1883.38s]  Nailed it. I look like I'm fucking 15 years older in that middle picture.
[1884.02s -> 1891.38s]  Player two didn't even get to do anything. How am I still losing to the guy in the bathrobe
[1892.02s -> 1899.30s]  when he didn't even do anything? Fuck that guy. That guy sucks. What did you say to me?
[1905.85s -> 1910.41s]  Start the water from rising. Shut the valve as if your life depended on it. I have to do his face.
[1931.61s -> 1943.42s]  You didn't even mess up your hair. I did though. I did.
[1946.73s -> 1957.05s]  Shut up. Fuck. It's me. It's me. I gotta do a better job to get the wasps.
[1962.87s -> 1980.20s]  I gotta do better than me. It's gotta be slow. Slow and flick the fingers.
[1990.36s -> 1993.80s]  This is embarrassing. Hold on. I gotta make this less embarrassing.
[1994.92s -> 2011.48s]  You didn't get stung at all. Player two, I need you on set please. When I put on this other thing
[2011.48s -> 2017.43s]  on the ground here, you guys have no idea. This is going to get impossible. I need a personal
[2017.43s -> 2022.07s]  assistant. It's time for your starring moment. Follow my instruction and act your heart out.
[2025.27s -> 2042.66s]  Act like you're a nervous wreck. Action. Nearly there. Now try this. What? Run on the spot as if
[2042.66s -> 2058.55s]  you're being chased. And action. Keep rolling baby. Fuck. One more. Shiver uncontrollably like
[2058.55s -> 2086.76s]  you're freezing. That was really good. Amazing. That was really good. It was. I don't want to,
[2086.76s -> 2096.07s]  you know, toot my second horn here, but it was pretty good. Just wait till I get my third and
[2096.07s -> 2102.25s]  fourth horn in here. Player one, come to the set please. Player one, it's me. Great job. No,
[2102.25s -> 2107.48s]  you good job. Good job. Good job. Now it's my turn. Pick the clothes that matter. What?
[2108.82s -> 2115.38s]  The costumes are all dirty. Pick the outfit that matches the hat and give them a good scrub.
[2115.38s -> 2127.94s]  Scrub the clothes? Why? I need like a lower body. Pick the what? Fuck. That's good. Now give it a
[2128.02s -> 2143.38s]  good wash. Come on. Are you sure that was right? Give it a wash anyway. You only got one. Oh,
[2143.38s -> 2151.74s]  no. Right. Right. Okay. Add the outfit to the hat. Okay. I fucked it up. Not that one. That one.
[2151.74s -> 2160.78s]  Scrub it up and see what happens. Wait. This is, this is. Okay. So now I didn't even see the hat.
[2160.78s -> 2164.14s]  Come on. Are you sure that was right? I didn't see the hat. Give it a wash anyway. I didn't.
[2164.14s -> 2171.70s]  Sorry. Second me will get this. You're supposed to match the outfit to the hat. To the hat. Okay.
[2171.70s -> 2177.14s]  I can do it now. Ready? All right. It's just a regular hat. Now it's this hat. It's not the
[2177.14s -> 2191.59s]  clown hat. That's not the clown. That's not a regulation clown hat. Oh. Fuck that part.
[2193.03s -> 2197.51s]  How? How is that not good? How can you even determine that?
[2204.33s -> 2208.22s]  All right. I gotta nail this. Get the ball in the hole three times.
[2209.10s -> 2214.46s]  Oh, this is the, this is this thing again. Okay. It's all the fun.
[2253.43s -> 2268.97s]  Got it. Print. Ship it. Get yourself to the set. Holy shit. There's even more.
[2269.77s -> 2276.25s]  We need to do a few retakes. Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.
[2276.33s -> 2293.54s]  Retakes. How fucking you lean? Pretty far. And action. Get up. That was fantastic. You were a star.
[2297.46s -> 2304.50s]  That's fucking stupid. You take those green grass. Perfect. Let's go to the movies.
[2305.14s -> 2311.18s]  Here we go. Got it. Wait five minutes for it to load.
[2339.40s -> 2343.08s]  Is there any mature ones? It was a day like any other day.
[2345.85s -> 2359.74s]  Until a terrible accident. Created a horrifying atomic monster. Cold blooded. Watch in terror
[2359.74s -> 2371.75s]  as the radioactive mastodon wreaks havoc. Created by nature. Twisted by science.
[2373.62s -> 2384.31s]  No weapons of warfare known to man can harm it. Can anything stop this leviathan?
[2386.94s -> 2401.43s]  Can mankind use science to fight nature with nature? Feel your blood run cold. Cold blooded.
[2405.51s -> 2411.03s]  Terrible. That was awful. That was really, really awful. Truly awful.
[2411.99s -> 2415.19s]  Best part is when he pushed me. They didn't even use the lean. What was the point of the lean?
[2431.72s -> 2436.92s]  That very beginning. Why do I feel like I'm watching green screen movie night footage?
[2436.92s -> 2449.02s]  That's like what this is. Except it's happening in real time. What do you mean don't save? Oh

[2667.61s -> 2672.65s]  prestigious award. Perhaps you'd like to say a few words. What can I say? What can I say?
[2673.45s -> 2680.65s]  I was cloned off of this guy right here, up there. Yep. And they gave me two extra...
[2683.29s -> 2686.41s]  I'm not good. I'm not good in front of people. I'm not good in front of people.
[2694.02s -> 2708.50s]  Thank you. It's been me all fucking time. It's been me. Like a crow's feet? How can I see that
[2708.50s -> 2724.36s]  on like a 144p camera? Fuck I do. I really do. Stop clapping at that. You maniacs. How do I get
[2724.36s -> 2744.62s]  this out of... How do I leave? Oh. Should we throw in a third actor? This one's called made of men.
[2745.42s -> 2755.40s]  Let's go. Me, me, me and me. Two friends break free to find they've been subjected to a cloning
[2755.40s -> 2760.70s]  experiment. What happens if it's just me? Okay, what happens if it's just me? Let's check our
[2760.70s -> 2768.17s]  equipment is working correctly. If it's just me, then who is the... What happened? Is the lighting
[2768.17s -> 2782.97s]  okay in here? Check the light meter to be sure. The lighting's fine. I bought this. This is a
[2782.97s -> 2789.69s]  Phillips Hue, sits on the table, coffee table, dumb fucking pretend ball light. I got this like
[2789.69s -> 2795.29s]  two years ago. Just about like a year ago maybe. I've not used it once. This is the only time I've
[2795.29s -> 2800.25s]  ever turned it on because I don't know what to do with it. So I'm going to add some light here.
[2800.25s -> 2815.58s]  The bar went down. What do I do with this though? I can make it a different color too. I wish I could
[2815.58s -> 2828.38s]  show you. Put it on the bright side. Is that going to help? Does it help me? What's this thing? What
[2828.38s -> 2835.93s]  does it mean for? Why did I buy that? It was like 70 bucks. Now let's position the camera. Make sure
[2835.93s -> 2840.01s]  everyone can fit themselves into the outline. I felt like, ooh, to be sitting on the coffee table
[2840.01s -> 2844.73s]  and I can make it like a nice warm hue. If you find that anyone is too short or too tall to fit in.
[2845.29s -> 2847.21s]  I've never used that light once.
[2857.00s -> 2859.48s]  Hopefully they get my fucking... I need to get like a light pin.
[2870.36s -> 2871.80s]  I need like red pins.
[2872.12s -> 2877.80s]  With the cutout style to see the best results. Can you see yourself clearly in front of the
[2877.80s -> 2884.20s]  background movie? Four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four,
[2884.20s -> 2896.06s]  four, four, four. Four? But that's a little... Can you like see the outline though? I don't like
[2896.06s -> 2906.55s]  being able to see the outline. It's just like pretend. Four is bad luck. Better than two. What about
[2906.55s -> 2911.74s]  three? All right, I'm just gonna sit right here and I'm not gonna move from like here. Ready?
[2912.86s -> 2925.90s]  One looks all right. One looks okay. Three's too wiggly. And four has like a big halo around it.
[2930.36s -> 2956.82s]  One's okay. My arms are fucked. I'll try four for one of these. I mean, I'm gonna be like blowing,
[2956.82s -> 2962.89s]  but whatever. Is it worth it? No, I ain't doing it. I'm doing three. We're sticking with three.
[2974.38s -> 2974.86s]  One.
[2974.86s -> 2993.22s]  How many actors are there? Choose the correct number. Step into one of the four outlines for
[2993.22s -> 3003.26s]  your picture. This will decide which role you play in the movie. If the picture is okay, press A to
[3003.26s -> 3012.38s]  continue. That's like, this is just emo slots. Oh, she's like, a Terma Wild one. Wait, yeah.
[3013.34s -> 3018.30s]  Oh, look, a Terma Wild one. Terma Wild two. Terma Wild three. Terma Wild four.
[3019.26s -> 3028.87s]  I don't even know who's gonna be who. Who's gonna be who? That's so stupid. All right,
[3028.87s -> 3033.59s]  this is gonna be fucking impossible. This is gonna be really, really hard. Bear with me here. It
[3033.59s -> 3040.07s]  might look a little shit. Player one. Okay, I got my other costumes are here. That one's there.
[3041.93s -> 3045.72s]  What? I need to get different pants on. Let's get the tornado.
[3048.92s -> 3057.62s]  Run as fast as you can to get away. This is on camera forever. This is this is for us.
[3063.75s -> 3073.03s]  It's gating on you. I played a bad wind, but this is ridiculous. Oh, we are just too wild and
[3073.03s -> 3092.38s]  crazy, guys. That's what I'm doing. Fucking Steve Martin. Player three, I need you on set, please.
[3092.38s -> 3107.90s]  Oh, God. You're at the fun fair. Press the buttons to launch the rockets and sink the boats.
[3108.86s -> 3128.87s]  Action. Look, look, look. This is the face for this one. You took him down to Davy Jones' locker.
[3129.67s -> 3150.66s]  You got one. Great shot. Bullseye, you hit him amidst ships. Look, look, look.
[3158.97s -> 3162.89s]  I don't want to do this anymore. I want to do something else. I don't want to be this
[3162.97s -> 3169.53s]  anymore. I only need like 10 seconds. A minute. You took him down to Davy Jones' locker.
[3170.57s -> 3182.28s]  Great shooting. Those boats. Is it four or two? Four? Is it four? Player four, get your butt on
[3182.28s -> 3198.15s]  the set. It's time to work your mind. Memorize the symbol on the stone block, then point to the
[3198.15s -> 3213.62s]  right scroll. And action. Now concentrate. Clear your mind. Use the power of your mind.
[3213.62s -> 3232.10s]  I'm like naked. Great. You are a memory star. Type one. I need new hair. Remember the symbol.
[3235.82s -> 3246.14s]  What symbol? Memorize what you see. I don't know. Oh, it's that one. Wrong.
[3246.78s -> 3254.70s]  You need more training. There's just a naked guy on this. There's a naked guy with holes in his
[3254.70s -> 3268.30s]  stomach. All right, four. We can't do four. Four's not going to work. Who's next? I'm going to keep
[3268.30s -> 3286.04s]  throwing my ankles. Player two, you need it on set. It's time to act like a clown with a bungee run.
[3286.04s -> 3290.04s]  Now run as far as you can before the power of the bungee drags you back.
[3290.12s -> 3298.20s]  I gotta like move this thing. What? Why is it all fucked up? Action. Get those arms moving to gain
[3298.20s -> 3317.37s]  speed. That was some bungee. You did it. There's a blind spot just taking over the whole thing.
[3318.81s -> 3326.84s]  I'm going to have to move this. We're going to have to redo it. It's time to put you
[3326.84s -> 3331.56s]  in the spotlight. Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.
[3334.63s -> 3350.76s]  Slap your fist and look mean. Action. That's it. Ow. More. Show me your best muscle pose.
[3352.66s -> 3371.80s]  Should I put the suit back on? Action. Keep it going. Let's do another. Walk on the spot and action.
[3373.43s -> 3383.24s]  That's it. Keep it going. I have no room to do that. Oh look at the one on the right.
[3383.24s -> 3388.60s]  Look at the one on the right. It's like my head's at like a fucking 45 degree angle.
[3392.55s -> 3399.43s]  Oh god. Who was it? Who was it? Player who? I don't remember who it was. Player three?
[3400.31s -> 3417.24s]  Walk on the spot. Action. Why do we keep looking over here and doing that like? Turn to the camera
[3417.24s -> 3435.96s]  and look shocked. And action. Nearly there. Let's do another. Stroke your chin like you're deep in
[3435.96s -> 3454.90s]  thought. Action. That's it. That was fantastic. You were a star. This is like I'm on some shitty

[3521.05s -> 3523.93s]  That's not, that shouldn't be in the movie. Don't put that in the movie.
[3525.90s -> 3531.58s]  What the fuck. Player two come to the set please. Is that I don't know is player two just regular

[3862.66s -> 3869.22s]  You didn't get the treasure. Time to walk the plank. I don't know how this is gonna play.
[3869.22s -> 3885.88s]  This is why I gotta do one or two. Player three get yourself to the set. Oh don't look at my
[3885.88s -> 3893.00s]  midriff. Watch the cups carefully. Oh by the way I'm wearing a fucking wire. If anybody says

[7233.08s -> 7245.56s]  posted online. It was one. Fuck. Player two. On the set, please. This is what I can't do.
[7245.56s -> 7250.36s]  Oh, no. I lost my wire. It's supposed to be in my underwear. It's supposed to go like up.
[7251.24s -> 7254.92s]  Not my underwear, but it's supposed to go through me. Now, you must have seen this before.
[7255.56s -> 7265.69s]  Watch the cups carefully. Then point at the cup that you think contains the P. Action.

[7522.17s -> 7534.23s]  shocking. Action. The heck happened over there? Holy shit. They loved ya, baby.
[7534.95s -> 7545.78s]  I'm giant right now. Stop looking at the camera.
[7550.30s -> 7555.90s]  The camera. The number one rule of all of acting. Player three, come to the set, please.
[7563.45s -> 7570.25s]  Now clear your mind. Focus your energies. Chop the blocks until they break. Where's the hat?
[7570.25s -> 7574.97s]  Where's the hat? Where's the hat? Where's the hat? Where's the hat? Where's the hat? Where's the hat?

[7598.89s -> 7605.21s]  Another rock bites the dust. Smash that stone. Actor smash.
[7607.13s -> 7614.50s]  You broke the rock. Boom. You cracked it. Bye bye rock.
[7615.38s -> 7622.34s]  Broke it. That was awesome. Ever thought of making statues for a living?
[7626.17s -> 7635.45s]  Players one and two. On set now, please. It's just me. I don't care. Am I drinking?
[7639.22s -> 7642.66s]  It's marathon time. Run the distance as fast as you can.
[7646.18s -> 7650.71s]  I'm not drinking fucking vomit. Action.
[7653.64s -> 7662.07s]  Slow down or you'll burn out. I know you got what it takes.
[7662.95s -> 7669.27s]  I need to go to the sprint. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourself.
[7671.67s -> 7681.45s]  We have a blowout, ladies and gentlemen. That was some race. You thought of going pro?
[7683.05s -> 7688.57s]  This does look like you. It really does. You're right. It looks like somebody pooped in there.
[7688.57s -> 7691.69s]  Player four. On the set, please. That's disgusting.
[7692.33s -> 7697.88s]  I'm going to get ice and get home. Play who? Four?
[7700.33s -> 7707.29s]  Dance to the music and match each pose. When the music stops, get into the outline and remember,
[7707.29s -> 7720.41s]  hold still while you're posing. And action. Move a muscle.
[7723.18s -> 7743.66s]  Let's dance. Freeze. Let's dance. Hold that pose. Let's dance.
[7744.62s -> 7753.06s]  Stop dancing. You were born to be a dancer. You won't take no for an answer.
[7753.86s -> 7760.71s]  This stream is fucking vomit right now. Don't look at my stomach. Player three. To the set.
[7766.70s -> 7776.71s]  And now it's your time to shine. Just follow my instructions and act like a star. Pose like a
[7776.71s -> 7796.34s]  hero. Action. Nearly there. You brought the house down. Beautiful. Player one. I need you on set,
[7796.34s -> 7809.21s]  please. Real heroic. Fucking costume changes. And now it's your time to shine. There's no scoring.
[7809.21s -> 7818.94s]  Just follow my instructions and act like a star. Blow me a big kiss. Oh, I don't want to because
[7818.94s -> 7830.47s]  people are going to keep this from me. Action. Keep rolling, baby. And another. Look up to the sky
[7830.47s -> 7852.15s]  as if you've just seen a flying pig. Action. Don't stop now. They loved you, baby. That's a wrap,
[7852.15s -> 7859.29s]  folks. Here we go. After this one, I'm going to get ice. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
[7859.37s -> 7871.27s]  which man investigated a photo of fairies in film fairies. True story vomit. What is Biff?
[7887.98s -> 7907.51s]  Looking for love is a tricky business. Having a best friend can make it harder. A little romance.
[7909.43s -> 7914.87s]  Excitement and security is what we're all looking for.
[7915.67s -> 7926.79s]  It's fucking huge. It doesn't work out. We try again.
[7930.54s -> 7950.63s]  And again. But sometimes the right one for you is closer than you think.
[7955.03s -> 7959.67s]  Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[7959.67s -> 7971.50s]  When he opens the door and he's naked, he's just naked. I need to see it again.
[7981.21s -> 7996.79s]  I'm going to be quiet for this one. I'm going to try. The whole dancing thing still makes no
[7996.79s -> 8002.23s]  sense to me. That's like a full two minutes of acting. All right.
[8003.19s -> 8003.69s]  Okay.
[8010.36s -> 8029.88s]  Looking for love is a tricky business. Having a best friend can make it harder. A little romance.
[8031.80s -> 8037.24s]  Excitement and security is what we're all looking for.
[8045.30s -> 8070.54s]  And if it doesn't work out, try again and again. But sometimes the right one for you
[8071.66s -> 8081.96s]  is closer than you think. Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[8088.14s -> 8097.85s]  Oh my god. I kind of have to. That was fucking ridiculous.
[8098.73s -> 8107.29s]  He's still at large. Why the hell keep getting arrested? The bar is closing on him.
[8108.41s -> 8114.55s]  Oh my goodness. I got to go get ice, man. I got to fucking take a break after this one.
[8115.35s -> 8128.02s]  That was fucking so stupid. What website was that? And the fact that there's a scene
[8128.66s -> 8135.26s]  with just two fat Fatsuit people at a club or something. What?
[8136.63s -> 8139.67s]  It doesn't make any sense. Did I fuck something up? I think I screwed something up.
[8141.67s -> 8151.19s]  It was the same person. I'm just going to call it love story. God damn, that was fucking fun.
[8152.23s -> 8159.43s]  At the very end, with pushing the cake, there's no context to any of this shit.
[8167.02s -> 8169.98s]  All right. I'll be right back while this saves. I'm going to grab some ice.
[8170.54s -> 8172.87s]  I'm going to grab some water and I'll be right back.
[8308.63s -> 8314.39s]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the You're in the Movies Awards.
[8318.36s -> 8325.64s]  And now the moment you've all been waiting for. The nominees for best actor are.
[8326.52s -> 8328.04s]  See, I had to blow my nose after that.
[8328.04s -> 8329.16s]  Nominee one.
[8332.34s -> 8334.10s]  Oh shit. Who's best actor?
[8337.21s -> 8338.41s]  Nominee three.
[8342.17s -> 8343.37s]  Nominee four.
[8345.96s -> 8349.64s]  But of course, there can only be one winner.
[8351.00s -> 8355.72s]  And the You're in the Movies Award for best actor goes to.
[8363.83s -> 8367.11s]  Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious award.
[8367.67s -> 8369.51s]  Perhaps you'd like to say a few words.
[8370.57s -> 8373.77s]  Really fucking excited and happy about the last production.
[8374.57s -> 8377.69s]  So much that I decided, yeah, I decided to do my favorite drink.
[8378.98s -> 8380.74s]  Cranberry juice, vodka, and vomit.
[8384.15s -> 8395.43s]  The Bay Breeze. Look it up. Fuck the Academy.
[8405.27s -> 8407.83s]  Drunk yet? No.
[8428.58s -> 8429.46s]  Scared witness.
[8429.46s -> 8474.79s]  Oh, we drop frames.
[8475.91s -> 8481.64s]  All right, let's get back to it.
[8482.98s -> 8483.70s]  That's really awesome.
[8488.47s -> 8491.19s]  All right, I'm going to turn it down so we can get back to normal.
[8493.24s -> 8495.24s]  Okay, scared witness.
[8496.20s -> 8496.92s]  Private one.
[8500.49s -> 8501.61s]  Let's check our equipment.
[8501.61s -> 8502.97s]  I'm going to move the shit back to where it was.
[8504.97s -> 8509.53s]  Oh my God, why is the fucking grease grate fell on him?
[8510.25s -> 8533.91s]  Okay, is it in focus?
[8533.91s -> 8534.41s]  I don't know.
[8537.21s -> 8537.85s]  Lighting is okay.
[8544.76s -> 8545.96s]  All right, I'm going for it.
[8545.96s -> 8546.92s]  I'm going for four again.
[8560.07s -> 8561.91s]  Now get back in front of the camera.
[8562.63s -> 8566.87s]  Try playing around with the cutout style to see the best results.
[8567.43s -> 8570.23s]  Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?
[8570.79s -> 8571.67s]  This one looks a little worse.
[8575.94s -> 8576.66s]  Recalibrate it.
[8579.29s -> 8580.17s]  That's all right. That's enough.
[8580.17s -> 8581.69s]  Two always seems to work.

[11900.21s -> 11901.09s]  You're not ready to direct a movie.
[11901.09s -> 11901.89s]  What do you need when you finish?
[11901.89s -> 11903.09s]  Use the director to save your correction.
[11903.09s -> 11904.53s]  Set the script lets you make your movie by playing the game.
[11904.53s -> 11906.61s]  Set the movie lets you watch and upload it in the movie theater.
[11906.61s -> 11907.25s]  You need further help?
[11907.25s -> 11907.57s]  Okay.
[11908.53s -> 11909.09s]  Add a shot.
[11911.28s -> 11911.92s]  Oh no.
[11914.84s -> 11915.56s]  Oh no.
[11916.98s -> 11918.50s]  Oh god no.
[11919.38s -> 11920.66s]  This is too much to do.
[11954.72s -> 11955.44s]  Fuck.
[11955.44s -> 11963.28s]  What is this?
[11963.28s -> 11964.08s]  People on fire?
[11964.80s -> 11969.81s]  I gotta unlock the other films.
[11969.81s -> 11970.53s]  Yeah, that's right.
[11979.96s -> 11981.16s]  Uh, this is from the first one.
[11986.53s -> 11987.57s]  Is it ghosts?
[11987.57s -> 11988.85s]  I don't even see this stuff.
[11990.21s -> 11991.81s]  I need to, I want to do these ones.
[11992.37s -> 11993.57s]  I want to do the one where you're a ghost.
[11994.29s -> 12002.28s]  Okay, hold on.
[12003.24s -> 12003.56s]  No!
[12004.20s -> 12012.18s]  Do the movies first?

[12030.90s -> 12040.69s]  Okay.
[12040.69s -> 12043.49s]  All right, that seems all right.
[12044.55s -> 12045.11s]  Review that.
[12045.75s -> 12048.68s]  Okay, that makes sense.
[12050.16s -> 12050.64s]  Looks good.
[12051.20s -> 12051.92s]  Done.
[12051.92s -> 12055.80s]  Is that in there?
[12055.80s -> 12056.12s]  Okay.
[12057.28s -> 12060.32s]  Uh, let's record this, uh, record this actor.
[12061.12s -> 12062.87s]  Should I?
[12062.87s -> 12068.40s]  I'm not gonna dance in the shower.
[12068.40s -> 12080.04s]  Okay.
[12080.04s -> 12111.12s]  Fuck, I'm just, actor one.
[12111.12s -> 12112.23s]  There we go.
[12112.23s -> 12128.07s]  I can control myself.
[12128.07s -> 12137.59s]  What the hell am I supposed to do here?
[12142.26s -> 12145.75s]  Is this YMCA?
[12145.75s -> 12148.76s]  Young man, don't you need to feel down?
[12148.76s -> 12150.04s]  I say young man.
[12169.56s -> 12193.65s]  Okay, what else you got?
[12193.65s -> 12194.29s]  Come on, give it to me.
[12194.29s -> 12195.17s]  Throw it at me, anything.
[12199.56s -> 12200.92s]  Um, I don't know, okay.
[12200.92s -> 12202.85s]  And then, record actors.
[12206.04s -> 12207.08s]  One of the ghosts.
[12207.08s -> 12223.81s]  Let's watch it.
[12223.89s -> 12230.45s]  Movie done.
[12230.45s -> 12232.26s]  Audio.
[12232.26s -> 12233.30s]  Choose soundtrack.
[12233.30s -> 12245.97s]  I have no way to record audio.
[12245.97s -> 12246.69s]  I don't have one of those.
[12246.69s -> 12248.21s]  I bought this thing secondhand.
[12248.21s -> 12258.39s]  All right, let's walk, let's go.
[12273.09s -> 12274.53s]  Am I controlling the wizard?
[12287.96s -> 12288.84s]  I'm just dead.
[12289.64s -> 12291.24s]  Okay, nice.
[12302.42s -> 12303.86s]  Well, this one sucks.
[12306.02s -> 12307.38s]  All right, I want to, I want to listen to the,
[12307.38s -> 12308.42s]  I want to unlock more movies.
[12315.17s -> 12315.65s]  Fuck that one.
[12315.65s -> 12316.37s]  That one was terrible.
[12316.93s -> 12320.16s]  Do I have any kind of USB headset?
[12320.16s -> 12320.64s]  I don't.
[12324.69s -> 12328.40s]  I don't have any USB headset at all.
[12329.12s -> 12330.77s]  All right, let me see.
[12330.77s -> 12331.65s]  Hold on, make it a movie.
[12331.65s -> 12333.17s]  Do I have access to the other ones?
[12335.36s -> 12336.16s]  I do.
[12336.16s -> 12336.64s]  It worked.
[12336.64s -> 12337.68s]  It actually did work.
[12337.68s -> 12338.56s]  No, it didn't.
[12338.56s -> 12342.58s]  Deity for a day.
[12344.23s -> 12345.03s]  Super funk.
[12347.22s -> 12348.02s]  Music things.
[12351.91s -> 12353.35s]  Vampire villas.
[12356.92s -> 12357.16s]  This one.
[12357.16s -> 12358.52s]  Let's check our equipment is working.
[12358.52s -> 12359.56s]  I need, I gotta get more.
[12359.56s -> 12360.76s]  I gotta get more ice.
[12360.76s -> 12361.32s]  I'll be right back.
[12361.96s -> 12362.46s]  Ice.
[12363.16s -> 12546.68s]  It's been three and a half hours.
[12546.68s -> 12547.56s]  It seems like one.
[12549.11s -> 12550.71s]  Yeah, it kind of is going by, isn't it?
[12551.51s -> 12552.95s]  Time flies when you have fun doing it.
[12564.00s -> 12567.84s]  I'm on my camera right now.
[12567.84s -> 12568.34s]  Okay.
[12568.96s -> 12573.57s]  You started three.
[12573.57s -> 12575.01s]  I had three and a half hours ago, yeah?
[12579.56s -> 12580.12s]  All right.
[12580.12s -> 12585.78s]  I'm just going to make a quick Bae Breeze.
[12585.78s -> 12586.82s]  We'll get started again.
[12587.46s -> 12603.44s]  It's cranberry juice.
[12604.80s -> 12607.68s]  You want to know if you're of the age of 30 and you can drink.
[12609.35s -> 12609.99s]  Shot of vodka.
[12611.56s -> 12612.52s]  Half cranberry juice.
[12614.04s -> 12615.00s]  Little more than half.
[12615.00s -> 12616.04s]  I fucked it up.
[12616.04s -> 12619.72s]  Half pineapple juice.
[12620.68s -> 12621.32s]  It's a Bae Breeze.
[12622.52s -> 12627.28s]  I ruined it.
[12627.28s -> 12629.28s]  How about vodka cranberries?
[12630.24s -> 12630.80s]  Yes, I know.
[12630.80s -> 12632.48s]  I know the hair just came down to the perfect spot.
[12633.52s -> 12637.46s]  Vodka cranberry, vodka pineapple are two timeless drinks.
[12638.02s -> 12640.68s]  This is a Bae Breeze.
[12641.86s -> 12643.70s]  You've never had a fucking Bae Breeze before?
[12644.66s -> 12645.46s]  Okay.
[12646.68s -> 12647.00s]  I don't know.
[12647.00s -> 12648.60s]  I just took a shower like three hours ago.
[12648.60s -> 12649.96s]  I don't know why it's in here.
[12649.96s -> 12650.92s]  Man, that got collected.
[12651.72s -> 12653.24s]  Okay.
[12653.24s -> 12655.56s]  Anyways, picture isn't focused.
[12655.56s -> 12656.06s]  Yes, it is.
[12657.49s -> 12659.57s]  Is the lighting okay in here?
[12659.57s -> 12661.17s]  Check the light meter to be sure.
[12665.16s -> 12667.16s]  Now, let's position the camera.
[12667.72s -> 12670.84s]  Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline.
[12670.84s -> 12672.84s]  He's drunk at five o'clock.
[12672.84s -> 12674.12s]  These are Bae Breezes.
[12674.12s -> 12675.56s]  They're not, like, I'm not drinking them.
[12675.56s -> 12676.68s]  They're straight vodka.
[12678.12s -> 12679.40s]  It's like a half a shot.
[12679.40s -> 12683.24s]  It's like I can drink like 10 of these and sing.
[12687.56s -> 12689.48s]  I could sing the entire alphabet.
[12689.48s -> 12693.97s]  Welcome to the Cutout Studio.
[12693.97s -> 12697.65s]  This is where we separate your image from the background.
[12697.65s -> 12701.17s]  Select Start Cutout Studio to continue.
[12701.17s -> 12701.89s]  You would sing.
[12705.46s -> 12707.06s]  I tell you, I'm not drunk at all.
[12707.06s -> 12708.34s]  I'll sing to prove it.
[12708.34s -> 12709.54s]  Like, okay, weirdo.
[12714.34s -> 12716.90s]  You know that thing that people do when they're shit-faced
[12716.90s -> 12718.66s]  at a bar at a karaoke night?
[12718.66s -> 12719.22s]  Hold on.
[12723.11s -> 12724.95s]  Now, get back in front of the camera.
[12725.51s -> 12728.07s]  Try playing around with the cutout style.
[12728.07s -> 12729.11s]  Breeze always works the best.
[12729.11s -> 12730.15s]  Breeze always works the best.
[12730.15s -> 12733.03s]  Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?
[12734.39s -> 12735.43s]  Two seems to work out.
[12736.31s -> 12738.48s]  I don't like the haze from Four.
[12738.48s -> 12739.60s]  Your core gets everything.
[12741.04s -> 12742.00s]  I'll just bring it in.
[12742.00s -> 12743.78s]  Breeze, all right.
[12743.78s -> 12750.93s]  The problem is like the sun is starting to set.
[12751.89s -> 12754.61s]  It's a chip.
[12755.73s -> 12759.96s]  Welcome to the Cutout Studio.
[12759.96s -> 12763.08s]  This is where we separate your image from the background.
[12763.64s -> 12767.48s]  Select Start Cutout Studio to continue.
[12767.48s -> 12768.04s]  Do it again.
[12771.33s -> 12774.61s]  Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.
[12776.12s -> 12777.32s]  Please, hold on.
[12778.84s -> 12783.09s]  Cutout, now get back in front of the camera.
[12783.09s -> 12786.77s]  Try playing around with the cutout style to see the better.
[12787.49s -> 12788.61s]  It's better, all right.
[12788.61s -> 12789.11s]  Oh.
[12790.29s -> 12791.81s]  Choose the correct number.
[12794.37s -> 12806.72s]  Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.
[12807.36s -> 12810.24s]  This will decide which role you play in the movie.
[12822.31s -> 12823.03s]  To the set.
[12823.83s -> 12825.03s]  Hey, it's five o'clock Pacific.
[12825.03s -> 12826.79s]  That means it's like 10 o'clock where you are.
[12828.07s -> 12828.94s]  What time is it?
[12829.82s -> 12836.01s]  Howdy, Sheriff.
[12836.01s -> 12837.13s]  This is a holdup.
[12837.69s -> 12840.89s]  Dodge the junk and punch the desperadoes.
[12840.89s -> 12842.89s]  But these never show up anywhere.
[12843.69s -> 12845.05s]  These never show up anywhere.
[12845.05s -> 12846.57s]  The punches don't do anything.
[12846.57s -> 12847.07s]  Action.
[12848.57s -> 12850.23s]  That showed him, Sheriff.
[12851.35s -> 12852.95s]  Come back and see me sometime.
[12856.33s -> 12858.57s]  Oh, I'm supposed to grab that.
[12858.57s -> 12860.01s]  Ah, my arm.
[12860.01s -> 12861.93s]  My fucking broke my fucking wrist.
[12863.77s -> 12865.05s]  You want to try dodging?
[12866.09s -> 12868.33s]  What did she ever do to you, bully?
[12869.13s -> 12874.62s]  That was a close one.
[12875.50s -> 12877.26s]  This is our showdown.
[12877.26s -> 12877.76s]  Nope.
[12880.44s -> 12882.04s]  One for the county jail.
[12883.40s -> 12885.24s]  Don't hit the dames.
[12887.48s -> 12888.12s]  Fuck at it.
[12894.94s -> 12897.42s]  Players two and three.
[12897.42s -> 12899.26s]  Oh shit, I forgot about costumes.
[12900.14s -> 12904.38s]  Two and three?
[12905.18s -> 12907.02s]  These were all fucked up.
[12907.90s -> 12908.46s]  It doesn't matter.
[12908.46s -> 12909.10s]  It's a holdup thing.
[12909.10s -> 12910.14s]  Tend like your treasure hunters.
[12910.94s -> 12913.66s]  Pull on the rope to lift the treasure from the deep.
[12913.66s -> 12915.74s]  Whoever does it fastest wins.
[12917.02s -> 12920.36s]  Action.
[12920.36s -> 12932.11s]  Booty.
[12937.16s -> 12943.82s]  I gotta get in this.
[12947.85s -> 12950.33s]  Player four, get yourself to the set.
[12950.89s -> 12951.39s]  Not good.
[12952.25s -> 12952.89s]  This is a mess.
[12956.15s -> 12956.87s]  This is a mess.
[12957.43s -> 12958.23s]  Play the instruments.
[12959.75s -> 12962.15s]  Imagine the biggest noise you can.
[12962.71s -> 12965.11s]  Play the instruments to make a racket.
[12965.11s -> 12967.51s]  The faster you go, the more you score.
[12968.87s -> 12972.58s]  Action.
[12972.58s -> 12973.70s]  Crash that cymbal.

[12998.41s -> 12999.45s]  Hit the tambourine.
[13003.74s -> 13005.50s]  Poke the child.
[13014.10s -> 13016.18s]  That was great.
[13016.18s -> 13017.86s]  You sure can make a racket.
[13018.74s -> 13025.37s]  Player one, I need you on set, please.
[13033.03s -> 13035.43s]  It's time for your starring moment.
[13035.43s -> 13036.79s]  There's no scoring.
[13036.79s -> 13039.35s]  Follow my instruction and act your heart out.
[13039.99s -> 13040.79s]  Vampires, right?
[13042.95s -> 13044.79s]  Imagine you're looking down a well.
[13047.94s -> 13048.44s]  Action.
[13051.62s -> 13056.01s]  More feeling into it.
[13056.01s -> 13056.89s]  Stay on set.
[13059.54s -> 13060.34s]  Surprise.
[13065.51s -> 13066.95s]  And action.
[13069.24s -> 13070.28s]  Keep rolling, baby.
[13071.00s -> 13071.72s]  That wasn't surprised.
[13071.72s -> 13072.36s]  That was just weird.
[13074.26s -> 13075.46s]  They loved you, baby.
[13079.08s -> 13079.80s]  Player two.
[13079.80s -> 13080.92s]  I'm doing a vampire.
[13090.87s -> 13093.27s]  It's time for your starring moment.
[13093.27s -> 13098.38s]  Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

[13101.50s -> 13105.12s]  Action.

[19917.69s -> 19950.06s]  Here's the last one of the night
[19950.12s -> 19952.12s]  spiders from space
[19953.90s -> 19955.90s]  No one could have dreamt
[19956.55s -> 19958.63s]  Such an eerie event could occur
[19962.81s -> 19965.18s]  here
[19965.18s -> 19967.18s]  On our own planet earth
[19969.53s -> 19971.53s]  But they came
[19973.32s -> 19978.70s]  They fed
[19982.87s -> 19985.19s]  They spun their meticulous webs
[19997.03s -> 19999.03s]  For your lives
[20003.18s -> 20013.40s]  They're freakish they're brutish
[20013.40s -> 20028.91s]  They're certainly parachute they're spiders from space
[20037.58s -> 20039.58s]  Where was the eating thing
[20041.15s -> 20043.71s]  Do you get that you could tell like where these are going?
[20045.96s -> 20051.32s]  They it started like the first like seven were like wow i'm like really into it and like these last ones have been
[20052.36s -> 20055.66s]  Just so phoned in the last two especially
[20057.15s -> 20059.79s]  They didn't even use the footage of me eating all the fucking stuffing
[20062.22s -> 20064.46s]  All right, we're gonna watch them all i'm gonna save it
[20073.20s -> 20075.20s]  Maybe when they're saved they won't lag
[20084.48s -> 20086.48s]  Oh my goodness, that was fucking fun
[20087.04s -> 20093.76s]  That was absolutely worth playing that was worth buying a 360 and xbox live vision camera
[20095.88s -> 20097.44s]  so
[20097.44s -> 20099.44s]  The best part about having a 360 still
[20100.24s -> 20105.96s]  After this because I bought up at this game. I bought a connect and I bought about 30 to 40 games
[20106.52s -> 20108.04s]  There's gonna be
[20108.04s -> 20109.96s]  a week
[20109.96s -> 20111.96s]  Maybe two weeks worth of connect games
[20113.55s -> 20115.29s]  I got
[20115.29s -> 20123.24s]  So many
[20123.24s -> 20125.24s]  Oh, yeah, I got connect star wars. Absolutely
[20128.86s -> 20131.50s]  Every connect game you can think of that you think is worth playing
[20132.46s -> 20137.74s]  I I have it restart the console. Yeah, i'll do that too
[20140.48s -> 20142.48s]  I'm gonna red ring this xbox
[20142.72s -> 20147.45s]  Did I get twister? Yes, I did
[20159.66s -> 20161.66s]  No connect games are worth playing
[20163.00s -> 20167.53s]  That's true. Well, some of them are
[20169.84s -> 20171.92s]  I think there's at least a handful that might be worth playing
[20172.48s -> 20183.23s]  Star wars connect dancing
[20183.87s -> 20189.37s]  I don't think I have that one
[20189.43s -> 20191.69s]  Connectable connectimals. Yes, I have that too
[20192.41s -> 20207.53s]  That's the only good one
[20207.53s -> 20212.17s]  So we will go through i'm gonna assume that I wanted a whole stream for this game because obviously
[20212.73s -> 20214.73s]  I felt like there was a lot to explore when there was
[20218.54s -> 20220.70s]  I do have rise of nightmares. I also have hunt
[20233.16s -> 20234.44s]  Yeah, I got them all
[20234.44s -> 20244.43s]  All right, let's take let's i'm gonna restart the 360
[20245.90s -> 20248.62s]  Should have about 11 or 12 to watch start to finish
[20257.66s -> 20261.08s]  Here we go
[20261.08s -> 20263.87s]  Oh
[20263.87s -> 20265.15s]  I am
[20265.15s -> 20267.84s]  Tired
[20267.84s -> 20269.84s]  I didn't think this game was going to take it out of me that much
[20270.32s -> 20276.24s]  But it did I think it was the changing clothes like every 15 seconds ladies and gentlemen
[20277.04s -> 20280.00s]  Welcome to the you're in the movies awards
[20284.09s -> 20287.53s]  And now the moment you've all been waiting for
[20288.57s -> 20291.37s]  The nominees for best actor are
[20293.80s -> 20298.35s]  Nominee one
[20298.43s -> 20302.51s]  Nominee two arm base arm and arm
[20302.99s -> 20304.99s]  Nominee three
[20305.07s -> 20307.07s]  Is the constant standing?
[20307.39s -> 20310.27s]  No, I think it was not many four. There's probably a combination of everything
[20311.64s -> 20315.32s]  But of course there can only be one winner
[20316.78s -> 20321.50s]  And the you're in the movies award for best actor goes to
[20329.52s -> 20332.88s]  Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious award
[20333.36s -> 20335.36s]  Perhaps you'd like to say a few words
[20350.09s -> 20355.05s]  I'm so tired. I am trashed right now. Not even alcohol. I'm just saying
[20357.20s -> 20365.69s]  Oh, how many different do you think? I feel like I want to do these
[20366.49s -> 20369.53s]  That's some of the point. There's like six or seven more that I think I'm gonna do
[20372.01s -> 20382.70s]  Steal the day some of these look funny, but uh, let's go to
[20384.06s -> 20387.72s]  movie theater
[20387.72s -> 20391.36s]  Watch a movie. I'm gonna restart the
[20392.92s -> 20395.05s]  console
[20395.05s -> 20397.05s]  This thing is on fire
[20399.76s -> 20401.42s]  Wow
[20401.42s -> 20403.42s]  This thing is burning up
[20405.80s -> 20407.88s]  Whoa easy, what the fuck are you doing?
[20411.53s -> 20419.76s]  It just spit the disc at me. I didn't do anything. I would say this is probably like 250 degrees
[20420.32s -> 20422.97s]  If I were to take a guess
[20422.97s -> 20427.29s]  Inside of here if I touched inside of here, I would burn my hand out to go to the hospital if I put my finger
[20427.37s -> 20431.64s]  Inside of this unit
[20431.64s -> 20438.75s]  Okay restarting
[20438.75s -> 20443.40s]  And here we go. I wonder what the bottom of this feels like
[20449.71s -> 20452.06s]  xbox sucks
[20452.06s -> 20457.58s]  Yeah, and so earlier today it was it was over probably 100 105 here in vegas. So
[20458.22s -> 20463.00s]  Probably not the best environment for an old 360, but this is one of the newer models. This is one of the slim ones
[20467.44s -> 20468.80s]  They can handle it, right?
[20468.80s -> 20490.86s]  Okay, here we go
[20490.86s -> 20495.00s]  All right, the slim models had overheating problems
[20495.80s -> 20498.60s]  Uh-oh
[20498.60s -> 20510.68s]  How bad come to you're in the movies the game that makes you
[20511.08s -> 20513.08s]  All right, we're gonna watch him start to finish
[20513.72s -> 20524.28s]  All right, we're gonna do who this is who cares
[20525.08s -> 20528.04s]  No, no, no, no, no, I might be in I'm no we're gonna do who cares too
[20529.36s -> 20534.84s]  You ready?
[20534.84s -> 20539.66s]  Who cares?
[20539.66s -> 20541.66s]  Everyone's super
[20545.64s -> 20547.64s]  every superhero super
[20549.42s -> 20552.46s]  But some are more super than others
[20560.19s -> 20562.19s]  And where there are heroes
[20563.55s -> 20568.25s]  There are villains
[20568.25s -> 20571.13s]  battles adventure
[20571.91s -> 20573.91s]  Breathtaking effects
[20576.01s -> 20578.49s]  Not a silly costume in sight
[20579.53s -> 20582.81s]  Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers?
[20584.28s -> 20587.10s]  rippling muscles
[20587.64s -> 20589.88s]  Astounding abilities
[20589.98s -> 20591.98s]  fiercer than a ranting mom
[20593.45s -> 20595.93s]  More courageous than a hungry mouse
[20598.62s -> 20600.94s]  Faster than waiting for a bus
[20604.57s -> 20607.37s]  So when you're feeling low remember
[20608.33s -> 20615.15s]  Everyone's super
[20615.15s -> 20617.71s]  Well, that was the first one and it was dog shit
[20618.73s -> 20624.92s]  Here's who cares three. I don't remember which one this one was
[20628.83s -> 20630.91s]  It was a day like any other day
[20633.56s -> 20635.56s]  until a terrible accident
[20636.28s -> 20638.84s]  Created a horrifying atomic monster
[20640.90s -> 20645.83s]  cold-blooded
[20645.93s -> 20650.41s]  Watch in terror as the radioactive mastodon wreaks havoc
[20652.83s -> 20654.83s]  Trying to dodge the laser
[20656.01s -> 20658.01s]  Created by nature
[20658.07s -> 20660.07s]  twisted by science
[20661.37s -> 20664.49s]  No weapons of warfare known to man can harm it
[20669.10s -> 20671.66s]  Can anything stop this leviathan?
[20674.35s -> 20676.35s]  Can mankind use science?
[20677.07s -> 20679.15s]  to fight nature with nature
[20680.70s -> 20682.70s]  Feel your blood run cold
[20686.89s -> 20688.89s]  cold-blooded
[20691.16s -> 20693.16s]  Okay, that one actually sucked
[20696.36s -> 20698.36s]  That was just stupid
[20699.56s -> 20702.60s]  The lizard was the best character in that whole trailer. It wasn't me
[20707.82s -> 20712.83s]  Here's me me and me
[20712.83s -> 20713.71s]  me
[20713.71s -> 20715.71s]  Me and me
[20717.28s -> 20719.60s]  Today is a day you'll never forget
[20725.37s -> 20727.29s]  somewhere
[20727.29s -> 20729.29s]  at some point in time
[20729.98s -> 20731.98s]  in a secret location
[20733.53s -> 20735.53s]  the boundaries of science
[20735.93s -> 20737.93s]  of being stretched
[20737.99s -> 20739.99s]  beyond breaking point
[20742.17s -> 20744.17s]  Through the miracle of science
[20746.09s -> 20748.09s]  You could find yourself
[20748.97s -> 20750.97s]  Becoming more
[20754.11s -> 20756.97s]  Much more
[20756.97s -> 20758.97s]  loads more
[20759.29s -> 20762.30s]  And then some
[20762.30s -> 20764.30s]  So when you're in a pickle
[20764.94s -> 20767.10s]  There's only one person you can count on
[20768.22s -> 20769.18s]  you
[20769.18s -> 20770.70s]  and you
[20770.70s -> 20774.86s]  and you
[20774.94s -> 20778.54s]  The thing the algorithm making everybody fat is just fucking too funny
[20780.48s -> 20782.16s]  Oh, man
[20786.89s -> 20788.89s]  Here comes the murder mansion
[20792.17s -> 20794.17s]  dial m for a menu
[20795.40s -> 20797.64s]  Today's meal is murder
[20802.25s -> 20804.25s]  There's plenty to eat
[20804.33s -> 20806.33s]  When murders on the menu
[20808.19s -> 20810.19s]  Murder at the mansion
[20810.83s -> 20812.83s]  Everyone has a motive
[20819.82s -> 20821.82s]  Everyone has a secret
[20824.48s -> 20826.48s]  Everyone is a suspect
[20833.42s -> 20835.42s]  Who has the last laugh
[20836.06s -> 20838.30s]  When a joke goes too far
[20844.22s -> 20846.22s]  But who is to blame?
[20846.88s -> 20848.88s]  Who is guilty of?
[20849.28s -> 20851.28s]  Murder at the mansion
[20858.56s -> 20862.65s]  No, I would not like to see it again
[20862.81s -> 20867.53s]  This one I think is my favorite. I think love story is my favorite. There's so much going on in this one
[20869.28s -> 20874.32s]  I love all of them equally but I think this one might be the best one just because it's a fucking all over the place
[20879.79s -> 20881.79s]  Looking for love
[20881.87s -> 20884.68s]  Is a tricky business
[20884.68s -> 20886.78s]  Having a best friend
[20886.78s -> 20896.64s]  Can make it harder and
[20897.74s -> 20899.44s]  Excitement
[20899.44s -> 20901.28s]  And security
[20901.28s -> 20903.28s]  Is what we're all looking for
[20910.40s -> 20913.93s]  And if it doesn't work out we try again
[20917.20s -> 20919.36s]  And again
[20919.36s -> 20930.92s]  But sometimes
[20930.92s -> 20932.92s]  The right one for you
[20933.08s -> 20935.08s]  Is closer than you think
[20937.76s -> 20939.76s]  Watch close to your heart
[20939.84s -> 20942.32s]  Because love is never far away
[20946.59s -> 20948.59s]  That's my favorite I love that one
[20950.06s -> 20955.34s]  Uh, I just the best part is the the picture the naked fat guy, right? That's your picture
[20956.22s -> 20960.40s]  That's what you have for a photo and then you show up naked too
[20961.04s -> 20968.09s]  At the front door and it's like that. Oh my god. Wow, you're so so dashing
[20968.97s -> 20976.24s]  This is the private eye one. I think this one was pretty good, too
[20981.64s -> 20986.86s]  private eye
[20986.94s -> 20988.94s]  It was a quiet day for crime
[20990.73s -> 20993.13s]  Then bad news walked in layers
[20993.77s -> 20997.71s]  to that
[20997.71s -> 20999.71s]  Everyone wants to play the field
[21003.66s -> 21005.98s]  And no one wants to get caught
[21008.08s -> 21010.56s]  Love can make us do terrible things
[21011.66s -> 21013.66s]  diabolical dancing
[21015.18s -> 21017.18s]  Sensational scandal
[21018.24s -> 21020.48s]  Most people want one of two things
[21021.12s -> 21022.08s]  love
[21022.08s -> 21027.15s]  or money
[21027.15s -> 21028.19s]  some
[21028.19s -> 21030.03s]  want both
[21031.55s -> 21033.63s]  Before you act on your suspicions
[21034.75s -> 21036.75s]  Get yourself some proof
[21036.99s -> 21038.67s]  Get yourself
[21038.67s -> 21040.67s]  a private eye
[21046.48s -> 21049.52s]  Okay, so the first my favorite part is the first scene
[21051.36s -> 21054.24s]  The private eye is sitting there and the door open he's crying
[21054.96s -> 21058.16s]  Before somebody like a customer comes in and he has to shape up real quick
[21060.92s -> 21063.16s]  Normal I can see that again
[21063.40s -> 21068.65s]  Private eye
[21068.65s -> 21070.65s]  It was a quiet day for crime
[21072.46s -> 21074.46s]  Then bad news walked in
[21079.40s -> 21081.40s]  Everyone wants to play the field
[21082.28s -> 21084.28s]  Is that person crying?
[21085.40s -> 21087.64s]  And no one wants to get caught
[21089.79s -> 21092.27s]  Love can make us do terrible things
[21094.01s -> 21096.01s]  Diabolical dancing
[21096.97s -> 21098.97s]  Sensational scandal
[21099.94s -> 21104.50s]  Most people want one of two things love or money
[21108.82s -> 21110.82s]  Some want both
[21113.22s -> 21115.22s]  Before you act on your suspicions
[21116.42s -> 21118.42s]  Get yourself some proof
[21118.66s -> 21120.34s]  Get yourself
[21120.34s -> 21122.34s]  a private eye
[21123.94s -> 21129.70s]  I mean, that's kind of bad like back to back. These are like just
[21130.42s -> 21133.24s]  I think I can't pick one. I can't pick which one's better
[21134.42s -> 21136.42s]  I think it's probably love story though
[21137.30s -> 21140.26s]  Let me see it again. Let me see it one more time and then we'll move on
[21142.66s -> 21148.70s]  Looking for love is a tricky business having a best friend
[21149.66s -> 21155.42s]  Can make it harder
[21155.74s -> 21160.41s]  a little romance
[21160.71s -> 21162.33s]  Excitement
[21162.33s -> 21164.17s]  and security
[21164.17s -> 21166.17s]  Is what we're all looking for
[21166.49s -> 21176.86s]  And if it doesn't work out we try again
[21178.22s -> 21192.28s]  and again
[21192.28s -> 21194.92s]  But sometimes the right one for you
[21196.04s -> 21200.58s]  Is closer than you think
[21200.66s -> 21202.66s]  Watch close to your heart
[21202.82s -> 21205.22s]  Because love is never far away
[21206.10s -> 21209.70s]  It's like a computer put it together. It's not even it's it's like just
[21210.82s -> 21212.82s]  Stock put it in a computer
[21220.28s -> 21227.08s]  God a computer did put it together. Yeah, that's true
[21227.48s -> 21233.00s]  But this this is the dinosaur one these these next three are fucking horrible, but we're gonna watch them. Anyways
[21235.22s -> 21237.22s]  It's yeah, it's like talk to transformer
[21239.56s -> 21242.20s]  It started with a meeting of great minds
[21247.50s -> 21250.06s]  And a plan to travel to a lost world
[21253.77s -> 21258.01s]  Journey to a land never be held by man woman nor child
[21260.78s -> 21264.94s]  Discover sights and sounds no human has ever seen before
[21265.94s -> 21267.94s]  Prehistoric paradise
[21272.23s -> 21274.87s]  Marvel at the mammoth monstrosities
[21276.87s -> 21278.87s]  Groundbreaking discoveries
[21279.83s -> 21281.83s]  Enormous eggs
[21287.86s -> 21289.86s]  Terrifying monsters
[21290.84s -> 21292.84s]  Older than your dreams
[21293.16s -> 21295.72s]  scarier than your nightmares a
[21297.00s -> 21299.00s]  Daring rescue mission
[21299.32s -> 21302.60s]  Be prepared to witness the spectacle that is
[21303.54s -> 21305.54s]  Prehistoric paradise
[21306.68s -> 21311.24s]  It's like your actor was so bad that they just got like drunk on set every day
[21311.96s -> 21313.96s]  And they didn't even do their lines
[21314.12s -> 21318.44s]  So you had to piece something together. What you you you already were halfway through making the whole movie
[21325.36s -> 21327.94s]  Vampire, I don't remember vampire. I don't even remember this one
[21329.14s -> 21334.82s]  Oh, yeah, the scooby doo who run this one is the most coherent. I think it was supposed to be
[21335.70s -> 21337.70s]  the trip of a lifetime
[21339.11s -> 21341.43s]  It turned into a holiday from hell
[21345.64s -> 21349.72s]  Gaze and horror upon the bizarre creatures of the night
[21351.82s -> 21353.74s]  This is the vacation
[21353.74s -> 21354.94s]  to end
[21354.94s -> 21356.94s]  all vacations
[21357.43s -> 21359.67s]  You won't be able
[21359.99s -> 21364.18s]  To leave will anyone hear you scream?
[21365.30s -> 21370.49s]  There's loads of excitement
[21370.81s -> 21373.80s]  But be sure
[21373.80s -> 21375.80s]  Not to lose your head
[21375.96s -> 21386.76s]  Your friends for dinner literally
[21397.58s -> 21398.78s]  So
[21398.78s -> 21401.82s]  If you feel the life being sucked out of you
[21403.18s -> 21405.18s]  It's time for a vampiric
[21405.80s -> 21407.80s]  vacation
[21412.90s -> 21417.22s]  I like I like this one, but I like one part there's only one part of like when they're at the dinner table
[21418.18s -> 21419.22s]  and
[21419.22s -> 21422.82s]  The robe robe guy has like a wine glass in his hand and he's just like
[21424.00s -> 21427.06s]  Overanimated and over enunciating that's what we'll see one more time
[21428.57s -> 21430.41s]  It was supposed to be
[21430.49s -> 21432.49s]  The trip of a lifetime
[21433.82s -> 21436.22s]  It turned into a holiday from hell
[21438.74s -> 21440.39s]  What's the dinner?
[21440.39s -> 21444.47s]  Gaze and horror upon the bizarre creatures of the night
[21446.57s -> 21448.49s]  This is the vacation
[21448.49s -> 21449.69s]  to end
[21449.69s -> 21451.69s]  all vacations
[21452.17s -> 21454.17s]  You won't be able to leave
[21457.29s -> 21459.29s]  Will anyone hear you scream?
[21463.24s -> 21465.24s]  There's loads of excitement
[21466.23s -> 21469.67s]  What a lovely game but be sure not to lose your head
[21477.96s -> 21489.48s]  Have your friends for dinner literally and that's what I tried to rip through it didn't work
[21492.36s -> 21493.48s]  So
[21493.48s -> 21496.52s]  If you feel the life being sucked out of you
[21497.88s -> 21499.88s]  It's time for a vampiric
[21500.58s -> 21502.58s]  vacation
[21507.96s -> 21512.38s]  All right, oh yeah, yeah, I
[21514.09s -> 21517.21s]  Uh witnesses, oh, this is the one with this one with shito
[21518.09s -> 21522.41s]  This oh, this one's the eating. This is the eating. Oh, I love this one. This one actually might be my favorite
[21522.49s -> 21525.45s]  It's it's tough because it's so fucking scared witness
[21533.99s -> 21536.23s]  There are no perfect crimes
[21538.12s -> 21540.12s]  And when you're the only witness
[21541.56s -> 21543.96s]  Danger lurks around every corner
[21547.32s -> 21552.44s]  It's a deadly game
[21552.84s -> 21561.93s]  When you for your life hiding a secret that nobody knows
[21566.78s -> 21569.51s]  chased
[21569.51s -> 21571.51s]  hunted
[21573.01s -> 21576.07s]  Excitement lies dead ahead
[21578.65s -> 21580.65s]  Jeopardy awaits
[21581.61s -> 21583.37s]  Impending peril
[21583.37s -> 21588.76s]  Would you go?
[21588.76s -> 21590.28s]  if you
[21590.28s -> 21592.28s]  Over there. Yes, you
[21593.08s -> 21595.08s]  Were scared witness
[21603.43s -> 21607.27s]  And then I did an even better one in this next one when I stuffed the whole thing in my mouth
[21607.35s -> 21609.51s]  And they didn't even use it. They didn't even use any of it
[21611.06s -> 21612.60s]  deity
[21612.60s -> 21614.60s]  Oh, right the book one
[21621.58s -> 21632.26s]  Deity for a day feeling washed up life got you beat
[21637.50s -> 21639.50s]  Seeing things again
[21639.83s -> 21641.83s]  Why not get away?
[21642.07s -> 21647.56s]  yourself
[21647.56s -> 21649.56s]  in paradise
[21656.01s -> 21660.17s]  Meet new friends
[21660.17s -> 21662.17s]  dance with the natives
[21662.71s -> 21664.71s]  eat fantastic feasts
[21666.15s -> 21668.15s]  And if you ever get homesick
[21670.09s -> 21672.09s]  A warm welcome awaits you
[21687.56s -> 21689.56s]  deity for a day
[21690.02s -> 21700.95s]  Will you ever tire of being admired? This is that was this is the one that it was just I was done
[21701.11s -> 21703.27s]  I was done. I was didn't want dumb was done doing this
[21706.90s -> 21715.80s]  God
[21724.52s -> 21730.17s]  When did that even happen no one could have dreamt such an eerie event could occur
[21733.62s -> 21734.98s]  here
[21734.98s -> 21736.98s]  on our own planet earth
[21737.70s -> 21739.70s]  But they came
[21740.34s -> 21747.91s]  They fed
[21747.91s -> 21750.23s]  They spun their meticulous webs
[21754.79s -> 21756.79s]  Run for your lives
[21759.03s -> 21761.03s]  They're freakish
[21764.87s -> 21766.87s]  They're brutish
[21768.02s -> 21770.02s]  They're certainly her suit
[21776.02s -> 21779.30s]  They're spiders from space
[21800.10s -> 21803.56s]  Oh, who cares one
[21807.98s -> 21813.50s]  I think it's just it's just the superhero one, but I might be naked. Let me see
[21827.02s -> 21829.02s]  These superheroes super
[21830.54s -> 21833.58s]  But some are more naked good others
[21841.16s -> 21843.16s]  And where there are heroes
[21844.42s -> 21847.38s]  There are villains. I don't think i'm gonna end this for more than a second
[21849.16s -> 21851.48s]  That I I tested it. I think i'm going to eventually
[21852.90s -> 21856.74s]  breathtaking effects
[21856.84s -> 21859.40s]  Not a silly costume in sight
[21860.36s -> 21863.56s]  Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers
[21865.08s -> 21867.83s]  Rippling muscles
[21867.91s -> 21869.91s]  I just need testing
[21870.71s -> 21872.71s]  fiercer than a ranting mom
[21873.88s -> 21876.60s]  I told you I was going to make work out here hungry mouse
[21879.21s -> 21881.53s]  faster than waiting for a bus
[21885.11s -> 21887.11s]  So when you're feeling low
[21887.57s -> 21888.87s]  remember

[22183.78s -> 22186.66s]  Star's computer was all screwed up or something his power supply was fucked up

[22229.05s -> 22234.49s]  Whatever not like i'm gonna use it ever again unless I play this but I do have a second one because I bought two accidentally
[22237.77s -> 22240.41s]  How much was the xbox camera it here's what I didn't know
[22241.37s -> 22244.25s]  Uh, you're in the movies comes with one of those
[22245.37s -> 22247.37s]  I did not know that
[22247.37s -> 22250.73s]  So I bought one of those separately and it's sealed in a clamshell box
[22251.29s -> 22253.45s]  Uh, I didn't know you got one when you bought it. So
[22255.13s -> 22257.13s]  It didn't say that on the list
[22258.50s -> 22263.32s]  Unfortunately, so I have a second fresh one. Maybe i'll plug the fresh one in in like six months. We'll do it again
[22265.03s -> 22266.89s]  Sell it on ebay
[22266.89s -> 22269.72s]  No, I want to keep it. I want to keep it forever
[22270.94s -> 22273.58s]  All right, let's do the bits. Let's uh actually get this

[22283.30s -> 22286.74s]  At least quick enough where we can head to the other ones too because I don't want to be too late tonight
[22287.56s -> 22291.88s]  Because this is a good place to kind of stop and this is what I want to have happen in the future as well
[22292.90s -> 22294.82s]  those of you that have been around
[22294.82s -> 22296.82s]  Uh just hanging out for the last
[22297.78s -> 22300.74s]  Maybe a couple weeks or so once or twice. I have talked about
[22301.70s -> 22304.34s]  Bits on the beach. Oh, yeah, I guess I could just do this couldn't I?
[22308.09s -> 22311.45s]  Oh, watch this ready. We'll just have like some random shit in the background
[22320.36s -> 22324.71s]  Ready? Watch this
[22324.79s -> 22326.39s]  Zits on the beach
[22326.39s -> 22330.46s]  That's one there's one it's hot in here
[22347.88s -> 22349.64s]  All right
[22349.64s -> 22352.04s]  Uh, let's get to the bits from a few days ago
[22365.94s -> 22367.94s]  Watch out for that monkey behind me. Where is he?
[22368.76s -> 22370.54s]  Oh, that's a lion
[22370.54s -> 22375.75s]  It was a monkey. Okay. So from a few days ago
[22376.31s -> 22380.04s]  I'm gonna put these over here actually so I can see them better
[22382.39s -> 22385.51s]  We had a new piece of artwork from yenwen
[22386.15s -> 22391.08s]  Which I want to show on screen because it was insane. It was
[22391.72s -> 22394.28s]  Yenwen's artwork is more detailed than my own face
[22395.00s -> 22402.10s]  Let me get it here
[22402.10s -> 22408.87s]  Take a look at this
[22408.87s -> 22413.67s]  You've seen it. Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's it's I there's more detail than my actual face
[22417.72s -> 22419.88s]  It's the chin one. Yeah, look at this
[22426.84s -> 22435.99s]  This shit is so fucking funny. Yeah, nice pick. I'm getting it. I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting
[22435.99s -> 22439.38s]  I'm gonna VPN
[22439.38s -> 22443.06s]  The VPN I use takes like an extra five to ten seconds to open like any websites
[22443.70s -> 22457.46s]  All right, here we go. Why am I in a VPN?
[22458.18s -> 22460.18s]  Because my internet sucks
[22460.42s -> 22465.86s]  And routing traffic somewhere else actually helps with my packet loss because my internet's a piece of shit
[22466.50s -> 22474.62s]  But look at that
[22474.62s -> 22476.62s]  That's from a few days ago
[22478.55s -> 22480.31s]  I have to shave too
[22480.31s -> 22483.58s]  Look at what like two days does
[22488.60s -> 22491.48s]  Make it an emote. You look like night crawler

[22519.54s -> 22526.33s]  It's a jim carrey william depot. I'm like losing my face here
[22526.89s -> 22529.37s]  Slowly, it's deciding it doesn't like where I am
[22531.88s -> 22534.04s]  Uh, but no, that's insanely talented
[22534.84s -> 22536.84s]  there's so many artworks that
[22537.16s -> 22539.80s]  yen wen has done that are just ridiculous
[22540.60s -> 22543.74s]  And there's also a couple of clown car emotes
[22544.38s -> 22550.44s]  I might as well put this one on screen because it's fucking funny
[22558.76s -> 22570.98s]  Please shave take a break and break in a hot bath. You look stressed and not well. I'm all right

[22584.79s -> 22588.31s]  I'm a 23 and i'm 33. This is just what you look like this
[22590.01s -> 22591.61s]  I'm doing just fine
[22591.61s -> 22596.34s]  And i've been jumping around in my room

[22684.28s -> 22688.20s]  Uh, I thought you might suggest the dungeon keeper series and war for the overworld
[22689.62s -> 22691.62s]  Uh dungeon keeper is um
[22693.53s -> 22697.93s]  Didn't they remake dungeon keeper but it was a terrible game. Didn't they like redo it and people hated it?
[22699.08s -> 22701.08s]  Because it wasn't like true to the old games or something
[22709.51s -> 22711.27s]  Yeah, the remake sucks
[22711.27s -> 22713.80s]  That's too bad
[22713.80s -> 22715.80s]  But probably not probably not dungeon keeper
[22716.66s -> 22718.66s]  unless it was something that
[22719.00s -> 22722.68s]  I unless i've ran out of more stuff like because I have a lot of stuff that's coming that I want to do
[22723.16s -> 22725.16s]  It was a microtransaction nightmare

[22860.54s -> 22865.08s]  That's true. That is a true statement

[22963.91s -> 22968.55s]  uh, it's really fun to see people do things to everything that happens on this channel if somebody pulls out a
[22969.19s -> 22974.07s]  A clip or something that we did that was fun or something or that they thought was fun or funny and they turn into something else

[23440.86s -> 23442.86s]  Is it top down? Is that a top down game?
[23447.93s -> 23450.57s]  It is okay. I have seen i've seen this. I might even own this
[23452.20s -> 23456.12s]  I don't think of I think it was one of those things where I just bought it one day or like a steam sale or something
[23456.12s -> 23458.10s]  maybe
[23458.10s -> 23460.50s]  Uh, do you still use your instagram? I don't have an instagram

[23504.84s -> 23507.40s]  Almost 10 years ago and I have used it maybe three or four times
[23511.98s -> 23517.50s]  Yeah, all right. Let's meet a fat suit. I I know I just did it. I just was doing that for like the last six hours
[23519.69s -> 23524.49s]  What's your email germa 95 germa 95 germa 95 germa 95 at germa 95 dot germa 95

[23570.41s -> 23575.29s]  Let me go through the bits
[23575.29s -> 23592.60s]  I kept thinking about yeah, uh dead pixels. What are you talking about? Somebody's saying this dead pixels. What's what do you another arm?
[23594.10s -> 23596.54s]  checking monitor man
[23596.54s -> 23598.70s]  Your monitor seems like it might be fucked
[23600.02s -> 23601.70s]  I remember
[23601.70s -> 23604.42s]  I got a dead pixel and I bought a new computer. This is
[23605.30s -> 23609.54s]  It was a laptop. This is probably like 12 years ago or so probably 12 or 15 years ago
[23609.54s -> 23611.14s]  I got a new laptop
[23611.14s -> 23614.98s]  and there's a dead pixel on the monitor in the laptop and I
[23615.54s -> 23618.34s]  Fucking could not stand it. I lost my mind
[23618.74s -> 23624.34s]  I did a thing where you you heat up a little like washcloth with like hot water
[23624.82s -> 23628.10s]  And then you take the hot damp pad and you like massage
[23628.50s -> 23632.82s]  I gave this thing eight like four hour massage trying to massage out this dead pixel
[23636.49s -> 23638.22s]  It didn't work
[23638.22s -> 23641.02s]  Just like pushing and massaging and they say tap
[23641.66s -> 23645.50s]  You see I sat there tapping on this dead pixel for hours
[23646.38s -> 23650.15s]  It didn't do anything and it drove me nuts
[23652.22s -> 23657.66s]  Has that ever worked for anybody by the way has like tapping the dead pixel article that you get from on the internet
[23657.66s -> 23659.66s]  That's that one person tells you to do it
[23660.38s -> 23662.62s]  Has that ever worked for anybody?
[23664.25s -> 23666.25s]  No, no, no, no. No. Yeah
[23668.79s -> 23673.91s]  Why would that work? I guess it's you you it gets the electricity to get stick in there and
[23675.45s -> 23677.45s]  Get in there and
[23677.45s -> 23680.17s]  Move it around and the crystal. I don't know. I have no idea
[23680.89s -> 23685.14s]  Should I try to fix these?
[23688.54s -> 23693.10s]  Are those dead pixels here or those like dead pixels on on more of them appeared?
[23693.90s -> 23697.53s]  Is that the 360?
[23697.53s -> 23699.53s]  How many are there?
[23699.53s -> 23701.53s]  Shit, there's way more than I thought
[23702.78s -> 23704.78s]  Yes, I'll maybe take a look at the top left
[23706.30s -> 23711.11s]  That's venus up there
[23711.11s -> 23713.19s]  God
[23713.19s -> 23715.99s]  Oh fuck. Well, I may have just made it worse
[23716.71s -> 23740.10s]  It's broken
[23740.10s -> 23746.50s]  Hey, i'm just kidding now we're in focus
[23752.60s -> 23754.36s]  Okay
[23754.36s -> 23756.36s]  Uh, where were we?
[23756.36s -> 23758.63s]  I forget right here
[23758.63s -> 23761.19s]  Oh dark wood, right? All right. Maybe i'll maybe i'll try it
[23761.75s -> 23764.15s]  I don't know. I have to look into it. I have to see that because I don't
[23765.77s -> 23767.85s]  That's it on my fucking hand
[23770.10s -> 23776.70s]  What is that?
[23776.70s -> 23778.70s]  Like that's a pimple on my hand. That's not a
[23780.42s -> 23782.26s]  What is that?
[23782.26s -> 23784.58s]  That's a pimple on my hand. Can you get those?
[23786.52s -> 23793.02s]  That's not a wart
[23793.02s -> 23796.54s]  It's I think it's irritation
[23796.54s -> 23804.06s]  That's not that's not a word. Look at I think I have a zit on my hand
[23806.42s -> 23810.58s]  Oh, you know what it is. It's from resting my finger here and getting that indentation
[23811.06s -> 23813.06s]  It's not a liver spot
[23813.40s -> 23817.74s]  I'm not that old
[23817.74s -> 23819.74s]  Uh, thank you to

[23836.54s -> 23840.84s]  Yeah, i'm like jacked
[23840.84s -> 23849.45s]  I could be a fucking green goblin. I swear too much though. Let's put this a lot of artwork
[23849.69s -> 23851.69s]  You guys are really killing it with the artwork here
[23852.09s -> 23865.99s]  Let's get it on. Uh, this is me
[23866.79s -> 23869.03s]  This is like what I actually look like with no shirt on
[23871.94s -> 23873.94s]  So you just had to call me short
[23873.94s -> 23880.36s]  It's pretty accurate to how big I am
[23881.40s -> 23889.66s]  At least in the chest area
[23889.66s -> 23893.37s]  This is not safe for work
[23893.77s -> 23895.27s]  What?
[23895.27s -> 23896.63s]  It's fat
[23896.63s -> 23898.63s]  No, I got those broad shoulders

[24337.21s -> 24339.61s]  You know, I I hate to like be that guy
[24340.65s -> 24345.54s]  does it mean like you when it boils up to that like up to your eyeballs and you're just like
[24349.24s -> 24361.16s]  What is it? What is it? What does it got on IGN? Anyway, I hate to be that guy, but it sucks
[24363.34s -> 24367.18s]  Hey, if I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't have played it for 12 hours. Let's put it that way
[24367.26s -> 24369.26s]  I got enjoyment out of it. However, I did
[24370.71s -> 24374.20s]  Uh, but thank you dead medic
[24374.20s -> 24376.20s]  Uh, we also had
[24380.49s -> 24383.77s]  The jack for 250. Thanks for the denmark time zone stream
[24384.71s -> 24386.71s]  Yeah for sure
[24386.87s -> 24391.99s]  All right, because I went to like 12 one o'clock in the morning. I think all right. Well, welcome to denmark
[24392.71s -> 24395.66s]  greetings to denmark
[24395.66s -> 24399.75s]  Not yet, but in like a few hours
[24399.75s -> 24404.55s]  Uh, thank you also to c4g for the 250. I just logged into wow and it's free t-shirt day in there
[24404.55s -> 24406.95s]  But it ends in like 10 minutes and I can't find the shirts
[24407.83s -> 24411.24s]  What are you talking about?
[24411.24s -> 24412.73s]  is
[24412.73s -> 24423.43s]  I don't know what that means
[24423.43s -> 24425.43s]  There's free t-shirt day
[24427.54s -> 24428.98s]  they don't give
[24428.98s -> 24431.48s]  t-shirts away in world of warcraft
[24434.62s -> 24439.34s]  Oh what you don't mean in real life you mean in the game they were giving away tabards
[24442.06s -> 24443.66s]  I see. All right
[24443.66s -> 24447.18s]  That's gonna be fun. I'll be playing that
[24447.80s -> 24450.60s]  Maybe not even on stream because I don't know if i'll be able to
[24451.32s -> 24453.69s]  I'm gonna break one of those servers
[24455.32s -> 24457.32s]  Hey guys, i'm playing under
[24457.48s -> 24459.76s]  shadow more
[24459.76s -> 24461.28s]  I'm streaming it
[24461.28s -> 24464.16s]  Oh, what's what's that behind me?
[24464.40s -> 24468.08s]  What's that? Oh, is that a stampede of like 600 fucking people?
[24468.80s -> 24474.43s]  Not gonna be I wanted to do that. I wanted to do that initially, but they're not gonna have enough servers to do that
[24478.19s -> 24481.07s]  There are actual stream servers if you still trigger really
[24484.51s -> 24486.75s]  only 600
[24486.83s -> 24489.79s]  How do they all right? Let me ask you this. I I don't know much about
[24490.67s -> 24498.59s]  Warcraft streamers or warcraft players or anything. I really don't but I know that there are warcraft streamers that have thousands and thousands of viewers
[24499.80s -> 24501.80s]  How do they not break the servers?
[24504.54s -> 24509.10s]  Yeah mutton street people that have like two three four five thousand more viewers than I do
[24512.20s -> 24516.76s]  How do you not like flood a thousand two thousand people somewhere and just crush it?
[24517.56s -> 24522.62s]  Do you just kind of hide where you play?
[24523.02s -> 24529.58s]  Do you just try to go to like a low population server?
[24530.46s -> 24538.41s]  because they did that thing with um
[24539.87s -> 24542.11s]  That like instancing servers together, right?
[24547.02s -> 24548.17s]  But
[24548.17s -> 24554.01s]  I have this weird fear that if I ever wanted to stream that game if there was only like 10 to 20 servers in wild classic
[24554.89s -> 24557.29s]  and a ton of people were streaming it and
[24558.57s -> 24563.29s]  50 to 100 000 people and even not just people that are playing with like the streamers
[24564.01s -> 24567.69s]  But just people that are trying to load into the game just because they want to play wild classic
[24569.37s -> 24572.33s]  I think they severely underestimate how many people want to play that game
[24573.29s -> 24578.11s]  Severely more people want to play wild classic they want to play real actual current. Wow
[24579.55s -> 24589.21s]  How many people are still subbed to wow but a couple million?
[24590.01s -> 24592.89s]  One two three million something like that. Maybe a little bit more
[24594.70s -> 24597.02s]  I would assume at least a couple million people are going to want to do that
[24597.82s -> 24604.36s]  Aren't they like three or four hundred regular servers?
[24605.16s -> 24608.75s]  Two to three million. Yeah
[24608.75s -> 24617.63s]  any more servers
[24617.63s -> 24619.63s]  uh, but thank you
[24619.71s -> 24626.99s]  Thank you mega big gargantuan for the four dollars first try after loadout swap, that's true. I do remember that specifically
[24627.71s -> 24636.51s]  Uh, thank you. Nile orian for the six dollars. Wait, you need money
[24637.31s -> 24639.31s]  In the game. I'll start with in-game currency
[24639.63s -> 24646.51s]  How was my day weekend? It was a little stressful. I'm not gonna lie because the internet
[24647.31s -> 24649.31s]  I was supposed to stream the last two days in a row
[24649.55s -> 24652.75s]  But just couldn't because the internet was broken. It seems to be back to normal
[24654.20s -> 24656.20s]  So I kind of had a stressful weekend
[24656.36s -> 24663.82s]  I'm not gonna lie. Just got a sec. I have we got a stress pimple
[24667.50s -> 24672.14s]  Uh, but almost done with from a few days ago and then we're gonna move on to the bits from today
[24673.53s -> 24676.88s]  Shouldn't take as much longer
[24676.88s -> 24682.48s]  Uh back in thanks for the 250 great 11 plus hour stream much boomer meltdowns. Holy moly. I'm tired of the mess
[24682.96s -> 24684.96s]  Much love to you germa and chat. Love y'all
[24686.11s -> 24689.87s]  Thanks for sticking around for that the whole thing if you were there for the whole thing. That was a long stream
[24691.98s -> 24694.86s]  Future gamer. Thanks for the 250
[24694.86s -> 24698.44s]  Uh, here's my burger edit. This is so gross
[24699.00s -> 24705.34s]  I'm hungry too. You just made me hungry
[24708.12s -> 24710.76s]  Well, I mean this doesn't make me hungry
[24712.36s -> 24717.24s]  But you said burger and now I want one of those and how it's still early. It's only like 8 30
[24717.24s -> 24719.00s]  This is what happens. This is what
[24719.00s -> 24723.47s]  I lost my train of thought but over the next couple months
[24724.27s -> 24726.27s]  I'm gonna start pulling streams back
[24726.89s -> 24728.03s]  permanently
[24728.03s -> 24730.03s]  To this time that I started today
[24730.43s -> 24735.23s]  I'm gonna start streams at about 1 to 2 pm pacific maybe somewhere around 12 and 2
[24736.43s -> 24739.47s]  I'm pulling back to the streams permanently a couple hours
[24740.67s -> 24744.76s]  All right. Now get this off the screen
[24745.52s -> 24747.52s]  people are eating spaghetti for god's sake
[24749.84s -> 24751.80s]  so
[24751.80s -> 24754.76s]  2 pm pacific is probably going to be when most of them start
[24755.74s -> 24757.74s]  and the reason why
[24757.90s -> 24759.90s]  Is i've started to realize something
[24760.70s -> 24766.30s]  I've been streaming longer than ever before yeah this last year i've been live
[24767.18s -> 24769.18s]  for at least
[24769.68s -> 24770.88s]  like
[24770.88s -> 24776.08s]  Five and a half to eight hours six to seven six to eight hours almost every single stream
[24776.64s -> 24780.32s]  And what ends up happening is once you start a stream at three or four o'clock pacific
[24780.80s -> 24786.16s]  Four five six seven eight nine ten eleven pacific twelve pacific even we try we we trickle in
[24786.96s -> 24792.00s]  It that's three a.m. Eastern that's like six five six seven a.m.
[24792.56s -> 24794.56s]  uh europe
[24794.72s -> 24798.48s]  So i've been streaming for longer therefore. I don't want to keep
[24799.44s -> 24802.88s]  Half the world awake if they want to stick around and watch a stream
[24805.00s -> 24808.12s]  So pulling the streams back to like 1 2 pm pacific
[24809.00s -> 24814.68s]  Allows streams to stop before it gets to be more than 11 or 12 o'clock eastern
[24814.68s -> 24816.12s]  Eastern
[24816.12s -> 24818.12s]  I used to do that shit
[24818.99s -> 24821.31s]  Back in massachusetts. I would stream till
[24822.11s -> 24826.75s]  You know i'd start at seven o'clock. I used to start at 7 pm eastern time and that was late
[24827.31s -> 24829.31s]  Thinking about that now that was that's a night time
[24829.95s -> 24832.19s]  Seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two
[24832.83s -> 24834.83s]  I don't really want to do that anymore
[24835.23s -> 24840.35s]  He thinks he's keeping people awake. Well i'm not keeping people awake
[24840.43s -> 24843.23s]  I just there i've gotten a lot of feedback about how
[24843.79s -> 24848.59s]  Oh, I really wish I could stick around but it's four o'clock in the morning eastern it's like oh, yeah
[24848.67s -> 24850.03s]  I guess it is
[24850.03s -> 24852.83s]  I'm i'm like in one of those really early time zones
[24854.56s -> 24856.73s]  so
[24856.73s -> 24859.85s]  It'll be something i'll trickle in. I mean this stream started at like 130
[24860.73s -> 24862.97s]  You can expect that same kind of window
[24863.29s -> 24866.57s]  Like one to two like 12 to one one to two something like that
[24867.45s -> 24873.92s]  So I like clam chowder. Yeah, it's good
[24874.24s -> 24876.06s]  Take out the clams
[24876.06s -> 24879.82s]  Add some potatoes and some corn and you got me you got me there. I'm not a big fan of clams
[24880.38s -> 24882.86s]  Fried clams are all right, but uh claims kind of freaked me out
[24885.12s -> 24888.16s]  I'm more of a corn. I'm more of i'm a fish chowder person. I like fish chowder
[24888.72s -> 24890.72s]  I don't really like clams though
[24891.58s -> 24894.52s]  but anyways
[24894.52s -> 24896.60s]  Uh marvosh mcgally. Thanks for the 250
[24896.60s -> 24900.76s]  It's always fascinating leaving the stream at 1 a.m and finding you still streaming at 9 a.m
[24901.32s -> 24904.68s]  After waking up. Hope you enjoyed this weird game. Good night
[24907.58s -> 24910.72s]  Good night again, and that takes us to today
[24912.96s -> 24916.80s]  So why don't we open that up now?
[24916.80s -> 24918.41s]  earlier today
[24918.41s -> 24923.02s]  We're gonna go back to earlier here. We are we had
[24923.90s -> 24925.90s]  Three dollars from stefunky chicken today
[24927.64s -> 24929.88s]  Look up germa scares a room full of children on youtube
[24932.36s -> 24935.00s]  What is this? Is it do I really need to look this up?
[24943.76s -> 24944.96s]  again
[24944.96s -> 24950.40s]  Germa scares a room full of children
[24958.72s -> 24960.72s]  Well, I I don't I can't see it
[24960.88s -> 24964.41s]  Where where is it?
[24964.41s -> 24965.77s]  on youtube
[24965.77s -> 24971.85s]  Somebody already has it. Is that it right there?
[24972.17s -> 24982.54s]  Germa scares a room full of children
[25002.35s -> 25004.91s]  My computer's under my desk. So I have to I had to plug my headphones in
[25006.41s -> 25008.41s]  All right, germa scares a room full of children
[25030.14s -> 25033.74s]  What where
[25033.74s -> 25035.74s]  What I what happened?
[25037.47s -> 25057.04s]  Hold on a second
[25057.04s -> 25060.80s]  Why did you do jojo poses because I didn't know what they were
[25061.82s -> 25063.82s]  I had request. I had a list
[25064.62s -> 25067.18s]  One about that green screen stream. There were
[25068.04s -> 25069.42s]  hundreds
[25069.42s -> 25071.42s]  hundreds of requests
[25072.22s -> 25076.94s]  Hundreds of them and I had on a list and it was jojo poses and I didn't know what the fuck they were
[25078.12s -> 25079.08s]  I just like okay
[25079.08s -> 25081.88s]  I guess I had to get uh chat had to help me
[25082.44s -> 25085.24s]  They had to I had to find like youtube videos to see what they even were
[25089.42s -> 25091.42s]  I don't know what a jojo pose was
[25095.92s -> 25101.13s]  And I did all of them all of them. I think I didn't I think there was two that I didn't do
[25102.41s -> 25109.96s]  I'm the jojo pose green screen guy now. I've never I have not even seen a second of that show
[25111.80s -> 25114.20s]  I couldn't if you okay if you lined up and in the lineup
[25114.84s -> 25118.20s]  All the characters from that show I wouldn't be able to tell you which one of them was jojo
[25120.46s -> 25122.78s]  That's how completely ignorant I am to this whole thing
[25130.19s -> 25138.75s]  I don't know which one of them would be the man. I don't know who it is. But anyways, that was uh,
[25141.90s -> 25145.90s]  That was a stefunky chicken. I watched it. It was a little it was a little strange
[25147.82s -> 25150.70s]  Jeff gave five community subs. We had five from jeff
[25151.34s -> 25152.38s]  earlier
[25152.38s -> 25154.46s]  Beginning of the stream. I kind of was over there and not
[25155.26s -> 25158.62s]  Paying attention. I didn't have like stream labs really in my view
[25159.34s -> 25165.66s]  But thanks with the five community subs also, holy there was a lot of money earlier that I just did not see
[25166.70s -> 25167.74s]  a lot
[25167.74s -> 25169.74s]  Uh, first of all fiti gave
[25170.38s -> 25171.88s]  fiti gave
[25171.88s -> 25176.81s]  64 dollars
[25176.81s -> 25179.29s]  They say don't mind me getting my next bit badge
[25180.01s -> 25182.01s]  Holy shit. Jeremiah
[25182.09s -> 25184.97s]  Wait, hold on. Wait, wait
[25184.97s -> 25191.85s]  Holy fucking shit. You fucking suck at this dude, man. You're so bad at this game. I didn't even know it was possible
[25193.39s -> 25197.69s]  Just kidding. I love you
[25197.69s -> 25201.45s]  Uh, it was 64 from fiti. That's a shitload of money. Thank you

[25229.05s -> 25231.68s]  I ended up doing it. That was 150 in the first
[25232.70s -> 25238.03s]  10 minutes of the stream. Thank you. The three of you for your huge amount of money. Sorry. I missed it
[25238.11s -> 25240.99s]  I just was kind of back there so I couldn't really see anything
[25242.92s -> 25244.92s]  You're a big guy. Thanks
[25245.00s -> 25247.74s]  I like when people say that

[25276.09s -> 25278.30s]  Uh, thank you to the three of you

[25282.14s -> 25287.26s]  Please get a haircut my mom walked into my room and I legitimately got embarrassed because of how greasy you look great stream
[25287.26s -> 25289.26s]  Otherwise, by the way, i'm not gonna

[25301.72s -> 25305.24s]  Yeah, just so I just like got this liquid in my hair
[25305.88s -> 25315.32s]  Am I gonna stream tomorrow? Yeah, i'm gonna try to get a hold of star and see if he wants to do terraria tomorrow
[25316.75s -> 25321.37s]  He was having computer problems though. I'll find that out tomorrow afternoon or later tonight

[25340.84s -> 25343.00s]  Thanks for the the five dollars
[25343.88s -> 25345.32s]  Five dollars

[25349.96s -> 25351.96s]  Here's the drawing. I wanted you to see
[25352.20s -> 25355.32s]  I think we got we I think we caught this is the one. Yeah, this is the jacked
[25356.12s -> 25358.04s]  Uh shirtless germa
[25358.04s -> 25359.88s]  It was very very very good
[25359.88s -> 25362.03s]  That's exactly what it looked like
[25362.03s -> 25366.27s]  And they also say can you adopt me by the way i'm 21, but I hope that's not an issue. I love you dad
[25369.07s -> 25374.03s]  Uh, I I don't think that's I don't think that's possible. I can't take on any children
[25376.12s -> 25380.28s]  I have trouble tying my own shoes. I don't think I could ever take care of another person
[25381.24s -> 25385.21s]  21 year olds could be useful
[25385.77s -> 25391.34s]  Well, that I get you that that was that that's like a boomer thing to say I didn't say it
[25392.38s -> 25394.70s]  Oh, wow, get rid of my son gets to be
[25396.78s -> 25399.74s]  16 so you can roll the fucking lawn
[25401.69s -> 25404.57s]  That's a boomer comment there and you guys call me the boomer
[25408.83s -> 25411.07s]  Am I gonna do a meet and greet one day? I do them all the time
[25414.52s -> 25415.96s]  I don't really
[25416.04s -> 25418.60s]  I'm not like a meat. I'm not a meet and greet kind of person though
[25421.28s -> 25423.28s]  I don't know. I just never really have been
[25425.71s -> 25429.98s]  What's my mouth?
[25429.98s -> 25436.54s]  I during like packs and places like twitchcon or any of those convention type places
[25437.34s -> 25441.12s]  I'll usually tweet something. Hey, i'm gonna be standing here for the next
[25441.76s -> 25443.84s]  Hour if you want to say hello come say hello
[25447.69s -> 25450.97s]  I don't think i'm ever gonna have one of those scenarios where i'm standing at a booth
[25451.61s -> 25457.13s]  And there's a line of people to say hello and shake my hand I don't want to do that not into that
[25460.22s -> 25463.10s]  Feels weird for me at least for me. I that this is a personal thing
[25470.41s -> 25472.41s]  I I have more
[25473.88s -> 25475.16s]  fun
[25475.16s -> 25477.24s]  Knowing that we're all here together collectively
[25478.12s -> 25480.12s]  And if I do a meet and greet
[25480.12s -> 25483.32s]  Everyone's just hanging out. We're sitting around. We're talking about stuff
[25483.96s -> 25485.80s]  I'm not really into the whole
[25485.80s -> 25489.64s]  How are you? Good to see you. Have a nice day. Hey, how are you? Good to see you stay in school
[25489.96s -> 25495.56s]  Hey, what's that? Oh, I like that pin stay in school. Eat your vegetables. Goodbye. See you later back to the next person
[25496.12s -> 25498.12s]  It's I don't I don't like it
[25498.12s -> 25501.96s]  and that's not to say there's anything there's nothing wrong with that it just personally it just
[25503.96s -> 25505.96s]  It just feels weird for me. It does
[25507.40s -> 25511.40s]  It's nothing like that. I know but i'm just saying i'm a weirdo. I'm a weird fucking person
[25517.82s -> 25520.14s]  i'm a strange person and I think
[25521.98s -> 25530.36s]  Lightning bolts just go off in my brain every second. That's the awkward talk you have with your uncle
[25532.36s -> 25539.77s]  Stay in school
[25539.77s -> 25541.77s]  How is it nothing like that? It is like that
[25543.96s -> 25545.96s]  I guess it depends on who it is, right?
[25548.75s -> 25553.79s]  Ever considered going to do a small convention having a panel where you just fool around for 30 minutes?
[25555.02s -> 25557.56s]  I've thought about it
[25557.56s -> 25559.56s]  But anytime I go to a convention
[25561.77s -> 25564.57s]  I I sort of I turn into a little bit of a recluse
[25565.45s -> 25570.49s]  I don't really read I just kind of like poke around and look at stuff and okay
[25570.97s -> 25572.49s]  Hmm
[25572.49s -> 25574.49s]  Call of duty looks all right
[25576.89s -> 25580.97s]  There's a new uh new barrel feed look at I don't I don't hey look at me
[25581.05s -> 25585.85s]  It's me turbo dot at five. Welcome to the channel. I don't I just kind of do my own thing
[25589.23s -> 25592.59s]  some people really love to go to conventions and
[25593.31s -> 25594.91s]  Turn it on
[25594.91s -> 25598.11s]  And here we go. I'm fucking here and i'm ready
[25599.00s -> 25603.08s]  I like to dial it down almost to zero when i'm just walking around a convention
[25605.72s -> 25607.16s]  Go undercover
[25607.16s -> 25609.16s]  No, but people I've had people grab me before
[25610.56s -> 25614.24s]  You know, oh, hey, I I think I know who you are and i'm like, oh, yeah
[25614.40s -> 25617.92s]  Oh, it's interesting and we just kind of hang out and talk for a minute. That's it. I'm into that
[25620.81s -> 25626.01s]  But I don't think i'm not sure I didn't want to do unless it was something I had complete in total 100 control over
[25626.57s -> 25628.57s]  I'm, not sure I'd want to do a panel
[25628.89s -> 25630.41s]  Where hey coming?
[25630.41s -> 25634.97s]  Hey, what next? What do you want to ask me? I bet you know, you know, it's weirdly enough
[25635.05s -> 25637.29s]  You don't want santa when he's the mall santa
[25638.49s -> 25640.81s]  And like people come up and they they talk to the mall santa
[25642.01s -> 25644.01s]  Like oh, what do you want for christmas?
[25644.41s -> 25646.49s]  Well, uh, I want you know, I just I just
[25647.45s -> 25649.87s]  It freaks me out a little
[25649.87s -> 25653.07s]  Because I don't think I have very many answers for like a panel
[25655.45s -> 25657.61s]  He's comparing himself to god
[25662.20s -> 25664.76s]  No, i'm comparing myself to a mall santa
[25666.25s -> 25671.85s]  That is um, I think that's a little far off than what you are describing
[25672.57s -> 25677.79s]  Oh, he's comparing himself to god
[25678.91s -> 25680.91s]  The guy with the fake beard
[25681.15s -> 25683.84s]  That's not even the real santa
[25686.96s -> 25688.08s]  no, but
[25688.08s -> 25690.08s]  to put the to long story short
[25691.95s -> 25693.95s]  i'd rather just have it be a
[25694.01s -> 25697.95s]  Interpersonal thing and not a setup thing that people have to wait in line for or
[25698.75s -> 25706.09s]  I mean, it's not
[25706.09s -> 25708.09s]  I should do a mall santa stream this year

[25712.46s -> 25718.91s]  Just be a mall santa
[25718.91s -> 25721.47s]  I don't know. I don't know if i'd want to do that. I don't like that

[27321.26s -> 27322.86s]  we had
[27322.86s -> 27324.38s]  on top of those

[27335.54s -> 27337.54s]  It'd be cool if you went to evo some year
[27338.10s -> 27340.50s]  Or a meetup that week and I was gonna go to evo this year
[27341.30s -> 27342.82s]  It just didn't work out
[27342.82s -> 27347.86s]  It's not kind of too much going on
[27347.86s -> 27349.86s]  I will I mean there's no reason why
[27350.50s -> 27352.50s]  I would not be there
[27352.66s -> 27354.82s]  Something like next year this one
[27355.62s -> 27357.70s]  This is just an extended version of like this
[27358.58s -> 27361.17s]  that one
[27361.17s -> 27364.53s]  Should I just fill up four slots with this and just say who gives a shit?
[27368.37s -> 27370.45s]  I have so many emotes slots that i'm just not using
[27376.26s -> 27378.66s]  Yeah, this is just not kind of a kind of a different version of that one
[27381.78s -> 27385.30s]  Where'd it go? I love how I wrote this. That's so funny
[27385.86s -> 27390.74s]  Yeah, look at this. It's like oh I I did this
[27399.01s -> 27400.53s]  I hate my computer

[27405.89s -> 27423.34s]  Here we go. The arm
[27423.58s -> 27425.58s]  The arm is like green
[27426.38s -> 27428.30s]  That's
[27428.30s -> 27430.30s]  It's from the green screen
[27439.38s -> 27442.98s]  I feel like there's a curtain behind me that i'm like and here's the next part of the show
[27447.36s -> 27448.48s]  Thank you, though
[27448.48s -> 27450.24s]  I'll probably add some stuff
[27450.24s -> 27457.73s]  Why not? I might as well
[27457.73s -> 27459.33s]  Back to it though

[27471.33s -> 27473.33s]  And then they say not like this

[27500.29s -> 27503.41s]  So that last weekend before that is the carnival stream
[27504.05s -> 27506.21s]  So i'm going to be pretty tired pretty busy
[27506.77s -> 27510.86s]  It's going to be kind of insane
[27510.86s -> 27512.86s]  so i'm going to be
[27513.10s -> 27516.70s]  Probably a little bit out of it
[27516.70s -> 27522.38s]  I will be there on friday and saturday, but probably not i'm not sure how much i'm going to spend on the convention floor
[27524.08s -> 27526.08s]  I think I will probably end up
[27526.48s -> 27529.12s]  Maybe a few hours at a time on the convention floor
[27530.08s -> 27531.76s]  I'll be like, hey, i'm
[27531.76s -> 27535.68s]  In front of the smite booth or whatever does that game still exist?
[27536.56s -> 27537.84s]  I think it does
[27537.84s -> 27541.06s]  But that's how you'd be able to find me. Just keep an eye on my twitter
[27542.27s -> 27545.76s]  I'll say something about where I am
[27545.76s -> 27549.52s]  And if you see me then pull me aside and say hello by all means

[27697.98s -> 27700.06s]  These transactions were me
[27706.53s -> 27709.41s]  It when your bank is starting to be like, uh, sir
[27711.44s -> 27716.88s]  Are you sure you want to donate five a hundred dollars to an online internet clown?
[27718.40s -> 27720.40s]  Yes, uh confirmed
[27721.95s -> 27726.59s]  Uh, that's 500 bucks and I don't even know to say that's fucking insane
[27727.95s -> 27731.31s]  You've got to be shitting me guys like what the fuck is happening right now
[27731.95s -> 27740.34s]  a phylactery lich another
[27740.88s -> 27742.26s]  250
[27742.26s -> 27745.20s]  dollars
[27745.20s -> 27748.88s]  They figured it out and I guess they're just they're still going
[27750.02s -> 27753.54s]  My bank is also upset that I spend so much money on twitch fight me
[27757.26s -> 27758.78s]  Holy shit guys
[27758.78s -> 27763.42s]  Do you understand that that was that's more than a thousand dollars between these two people?
[27766.85s -> 27769.47s]  um
[27769.47s -> 27776.19s]  That's a holy shit
[27776.27s -> 27780.11s]  I'm speechless. I don't even know what to say. I don't even know what to say about that. That's
[27780.73s -> 27782.73s]  Unbelievable. That's insane
[27784.24s -> 27786.24s]  Thank you for the fucking
[27787.20s -> 27789.36s]  Just just just money
[27790.32s -> 27791.44s]  just like
[27791.44s -> 27793.44s]  A shuffleboard that you just went
[27794.29s -> 27796.37s]  with hundreds on it
[27796.37s -> 27798.34s]  I feel like I just
[27798.34s -> 27803.22s]  I put down like 100 bucks on the roulette table and then he's like, oh you hit it. There you go
[27806.30s -> 27807.26s]  Damn
[27807.26s -> 27812.51s]  Thank you guys. Seriously
[27813.49s -> 27817.25s]  That means a lot. I hope you think it's worth it. I hope you can afford that
[27818.86s -> 27823.66s]  If please please only give to this channel, here's like where here's like money to this channel, right?
[27823.74s -> 27825.74s]  Like if you subscribe to the channel
[27825.90s -> 27829.10s]  Then thank you for subscribing and like five dollars a month. Thank you
[27829.66s -> 27835.58s]  But if you're if you're giving tons of money to this channel, we're talking about like here's like the scale
[27835.90s -> 27837.90s]  Here's the tiers of money, right?
[27839.02s -> 27841.74s]  I'm some I gotta put me somewhere like down here
[27843.47s -> 27850.08s]  Right. Take care of you. Make sure that's happening. And if it is then it is and I just want to make it really clear though
[27850.98s -> 27852.02s]  so
[27852.02s -> 27857.70s]  Take care of yourself. Take care of your friends your family your life your expenses your entertainment yourself
[27858.74s -> 27861.54s]  And then whatever else you have left over. That's
[27862.34s -> 27865.14s]  I will take it if you give it to me, you know what I mean?
[27867.18s -> 27869.50s]  Because sometimes people come in with a lot of money and I just
[27870.46s -> 27872.94s]  It's an incredibly like humbling experience to me
[27873.50s -> 27875.50s]  And I it's it's a lot
[27878.50s -> 27880.10s]  Terma wants it all
[27880.10s -> 27882.27s]  Whatever you got after that
[27882.27s -> 27884.10s]  you know
[27884.18s -> 27888.66s]  Myself right up here. It's like by like a peter by like a charleston shoe
[27889.98s -> 27892.38s]  And eat that and then and then and then me of course
[27893.65s -> 27896.69s]  Says the guy who only reads above the doll of bits. Yeah, but that's because
[27897.74s -> 27899.98s]  I mean look at how long the end of this stream has been
[27901.79s -> 27903.79s]  You know, the channel has grown a lot
[27904.29s -> 27906.29s]  since a year or two ago
[27908.46s -> 27909.66s]  the
[27909.66s -> 27911.98s]  It I was actually thinking about this the other day
[27912.78s -> 27915.02s]  And this is kind of the I guess we can kind of go over this
[27915.74s -> 27917.84s]  is
[27917.84s -> 27919.84s]  Once that's when the channel grows
[27920.08s -> 27925.04s]  I obviously want to be able to still interact with people and if people are donating at the end of the streams
[27925.04s -> 27927.68s]  We'll go over them, but there is a very very real
[27928.96s -> 27930.08s]  um
[27930.08s -> 27933.68s]  Scenario there are real scenarios that have to be we have to know that they exist
[27934.32s -> 27941.36s]  If the channel continues to grow, you know, the average viewership has grown by 60 or 50 or 60 percent in a year
[27942.32s -> 27947.28s]  What happens if that happens again? It might I don't know I might drop to zero. I don't know
[27949.49s -> 27950.45s]  but
[27950.45s -> 27955.01s]  I I always have to be looking at it because I don't want to have a scenario where
[27956.46s -> 27961.66s]  The end of the stream ends up being as long as the entire actual broadcast portion of the stream
[27963.86s -> 27965.86s]  I don't know. I have no idea what's going to happen
[27966.10s -> 27967.22s]  but
[27967.22s -> 27969.22s]  We always have to be kind of
[27970.30s -> 27972.32s]  Evaluating how that's doing and how that is
[27973.28s -> 27978.59s]  But I never want something like this to really disappear
[27980.19s -> 27983.71s]  but anyways
[27983.71s -> 27985.71s]  It's the end of the bits voice
[27986.58s -> 27993.94s]  I back before I even turned it on back before I I was actually I struggled with even turning on subs
[27994.34s -> 27996.34s]  And key and like I didn't want donations
[27997.58s -> 28001.74s]  I'd never turned on I never had paypal or anything like that donations. I didn't have it
[28002.54s -> 28007.02s]  I kind of I was kind of reluctant to actually have the bits and have the subs
[28008.58s -> 28011.22s]  But then it's also another scenario of it. Do you want to do twitch?
[28013.07s -> 28016.43s]  Full-time do you want to stream three or four times a week?
[28017.63s -> 28019.63s]  20 30 hours a week on twitch
[28021.63s -> 28024.35s]  Just read during a stream. I want I absolutely refuse
[28025.55s -> 28028.03s]  The reason why I refuse to do this because I think it ruins the broadcast
[28029.07s -> 28030.51s]  I think it
[28030.51s -> 28032.91s]  Uh, it takes away from what we're what we're doing here
[28034.74s -> 28040.90s]  I don't like to read anything during a stream unless of course it's something like the like this huge amount of money that's coming in
[28040.90s -> 28044.32s]  now
[28044.32s -> 28046.67s]  I find
[28046.67s -> 28048.67s]  We I have a goal here right like today
[28049.39s -> 28054.03s]  Uh, I have a goal that I want to just focus on doing this. I want to have fun. I want to
[28055.47s -> 28058.91s]  Be able to have all of my attention be on the thing that i'm currently streaming
[28059.79s -> 28061.95s]  And it's not that I don't want to
[28062.75s -> 28067.55s]  Say to those people that sub during the stream or say to people that give a hundred fucking dollars right now
[28068.43s -> 28070.43s]  We're stopping because that's a lot of money
[28072.77s -> 28077.25s]  Whoa, whoa the two you just too many too many subs just went on
[28078.26s -> 28082.50s]  Too many that was a lot that was that was 69 subs
[28083.36s -> 28084.58s]  69
[28084.58s -> 28086.58s]  Almost fucking 70 subs
[28090.06s -> 28096.46s]  Holy shit phylactery
[28096.70s -> 28099.50s]  That's a lot. That's that's too many subs
[28100.88s -> 28102.64s]  You should have seen
[28102.64s -> 28104.64s]  This dashboard over here. It almost broke
[28105.95s -> 28112.50s]  Holy shit
[28112.50s -> 28114.50s]  and not only that
[28116.03s -> 28117.39s]  but also
[28117.39s -> 28120.99s]  Vilemi gave a hundred bucks. This is just the money stream right now
[28122.18s -> 28128.18s]  Thank you. Vilemi. Hey jerma speaking of a thousand dollars. I'll earn my hundred thousand bit badge with this one
[28129.04s -> 28131.04s]  I'm sure you know what I want by now
[28131.60s -> 28134.00s]  Love you. Jeremy. Keep doing what you're doing and you'll go far
[28134.80s -> 28140.75s]  Where you want one of these?
[28140.75s -> 28142.99s]  Hundreds of dollars and hundreds of dollars in subs
[28143.71s -> 28149.31s]  He's gonna dive in his pile of bits in his vault
[28151.12s -> 28154.48s]  No, actually that money is going to go directly to
[28155.82s -> 28157.90s]  Uh, it's gonna go directly to the carnival
[28164.32s -> 28167.79s]  So, thank you
[28167.79s -> 28171.87s]  Or a casino. Yeah, I what I could I could double it. I could double it right now
[28173.22s -> 28177.06s]  I'll just go to the roulette table put fifteen hundred dollars on red
[28177.86s -> 28184.58s]  I got the shirt on
[28184.58s -> 28186.58s]  I would not I would never do that
[28187.06s -> 28190.10s]  ever
[28190.10s -> 28196.32s]  Never my good luck charm, but thank you phylactery. Thank you. Vilemi
[28198.05s -> 28200.48s]  you guys are just
[28200.54s -> 28202.88s]  Absolutely, just spoiling me just rotten
[28203.82s -> 28204.86s]  Thank you
[28204.86s -> 28213.95s]  I hope I can use the money that you're giving me for things that
[28214.83s -> 28217.07s]  Can come back into the channel that maybe you think are fun
[28219.10s -> 28221.23s]  Thank you
[28221.23s -> 28223.07s]  treat yourself
[28223.07s -> 28229.57s]  To a McChicken later on but uh Cosmic Moses. Thanks for the five dollars, Jeremy
[28229.57s -> 28231.57s]  I missed the last few streams because I've been in the hospital
[28232.21s -> 28233.39s]  with
[28233.39s -> 28235.73s]  Necrotizing fasciitis or fasciltis
[28237.12s -> 28239.20s]  I'm not sure what that is, but hopefully you're all right
[28239.60s -> 28244.64s]  I'm back home, but that aging video with the up music made me sad like actually sad
[28246.56s -> 28248.80s]  Uh, hopefully you're hopefully you hopefully you're good
[28251.55s -> 28253.55s]  I'm not sure what that did that exact
[28254.27s -> 28259.94s]  illness is
[28259.94s -> 28266.35s]  But no, don't worry about me that aging video. It's just it's just it was just a little joke
[28267.66s -> 28274.96s]  You know, but for you
[28275.58s -> 28277.74s]  hopefully, um
[28277.74s -> 28281.50s]  Hopefully you get you can get that squared away. I'm not sure what that uh entails but
[28283.15s -> 28285.15s]  Uh much love to you. Hopefully that
[28286.98s -> 28288.98s]  You got the right doctors on the case there
[28291.46s -> 28293.46s]  Keep your head up. That's right
[28298.02s -> 28300.90s]  Hey, I gave 10 bits and my badge didn't update I feel robbed
[28302.64s -> 28304.64s]  Is it decayed? Is there a badge for 10?
[28307.23s -> 28308.83s]  My mouth is covered
[28308.83s -> 28310.19s]  Oh
[28310.19s -> 28312.19s]  Because I keep dropping this thing into the ground
[28314.56s -> 28316.56s]  By the way, this really does look like you're looking
[28317.52s -> 28320.72s]  Through to my stream through a dirty bathroom mirror
[28329.18s -> 28331.18s]  Uh, but thank you Cosmic Moses
[28331.18s -> 28334.00s]  Uh get well soon
[28334.00s -> 28337.55s]  Thank you so much for the five dollars
[28337.55s -> 28340.59s]  Fus ro boto. Thanks for the 10 bucks. Hey, there was a glitch in the bit system
[28340.67s -> 28345.95s]  So don't believe the amount that it says there is this is 100 million bits
[28347.62s -> 28354.26s]  Uh, that would be a lot. That would be at least that would be at least 200 dollars. I can't do the math in my head quickly
[28355.14s -> 28361.22s]  That's Italy. That's like 50 100 dollars or something. It's a lot
[28362.02s -> 28365.02s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks though. Fus ro boto
[28365.66s -> 28370.38s]  Peanut gangster. Thanks for 250. You think at this point your viewers have covered the cost of the next germa rumble live action
[28371.50s -> 28375.31s]  um
[28375.31s -> 28377.31s]  One at a time, you know one by one
[28378.86s -> 28381.50s]  I have to one thing that I do have to be careful of is
[28382.30s -> 28385.90s]  Because I am financing all these things by myself
[28386.70s -> 28388.22s]  I'm not getting any
[28388.22s -> 28392.94s]  Money from any other entity, right? It's just like the money that I get from twitch
[28393.82s -> 28398.14s]  Is this money that i'm using right? But I do have to be careful and I don't really ever want
[28399.18s -> 28401.18s]  any um
[28401.18s -> 28407.74s]  Outside sponsorships i've talked about it before with people at twitch and people that are involved in this particular project
[28409.65s -> 28411.97s]  It's it kind of it muddies it a little
[28414.34s -> 28415.86s]  What about fruit?
[28415.86s -> 28417.86s]  I lost that sponsorship
[28419.52s -> 28423.60s]  I hate I hate a bag of combos on camera and they ditched me
[28424.40s -> 28430.16s]  Like what ate a bag of combos? Yeah, they'll 645 calories a bag and then made it a processed fake cheese
[28431.44s -> 28432.72s]  What's the problem?
[28432.72s -> 28448.06s]  Whatever get a basket robin sponsorship. No, how much money did I get from the door cube?
[28448.78s -> 28452.54s]  Uh, I hadn't I had an affiliate code with door cube and it was used three times
[28453.58s -> 28456.70s]  so I made um
[28456.70s -> 28462.48s]  14 cents
[28462.48s -> 28468.80s]  nine cents after taxes
[28468.80s -> 28473.44s]  Hey pigeon. Thanks for the 250 because I had to donate for you to answer it
[28474.38s -> 28478.06s]  Oh, I see. I see. I see that's what they're not like this before. Okay
[28478.78s -> 28481.01s]  I'll be a twitch con though
[28481.01s -> 28484.24s]  You'll see me. You will see me at twitchcon
[28487.34s -> 28491.76s]  Gonder lane. Thanks for the 250. Will you ever come back to the east coast? We miss you cox is no good
[28491.76s -> 28495.36s]  So come back to your comfy boston basement where you grew famous
[28496.85s -> 28500.85s]  Well, um fiber is being laid all over vegas right now
[28501.41s -> 28505.65s]  So I will have fiber over the next I will be on a fiber optic network
[28507.30s -> 28510.58s]  in
[28510.58s -> 28515.46s]  Three four months maybe it depends either late 2019 or early 2020
[28517.20s -> 28521.68s]  I will have a one thousand one thousand symmetrical fiber line
[28523.20s -> 28524.96s]  before
[28524.96s -> 28529.60s]  My 35th birthday way before that like six months tops
[28532.69s -> 28534.69s]  And the thing with fiber is it's not coax
[28535.09s -> 28539.17s]  So all this bullshit all these problems that all these awful internet issues
[28539.81s -> 28541.81s]  Do not exist on fiber
[28542.13s -> 28543.49s]  There is no
[28543.49s -> 28547.41s]  Oh somebody turned on their microwave and kicked everybody off the network
[28547.97s -> 28552.77s]  Somebody had an unscrewed cable coax that there's no noise ingress like that with fiber
[28552.85s -> 28555.70s]  So
[28555.70s -> 28561.14s]  And I say that now but it's gonna be a thousand upload. I have 30 up right now. It's going to be one
[28561.92s -> 28564.50s]  Thousand through a fiber optic line
[28565.54s -> 28568.74s]  It would be I would just be cursed. It would be me
[28568.82s -> 28572.90s]  The problem would be me at that point if I cannot have a stable connection with fiber
[28573.54s -> 28576.50s]  A thousand fucking upload then it's me
[28578.38s -> 28580.42s]  It has to be
[28580.42s -> 28582.42s]  When's the carnival stream september 21st?
[28584.18s -> 28594.00s]  Somewhere in the early afternoon eastern time, but no I have no plans on moving back to the east coast
[28594.08s -> 28596.08s]  I'll be on the west coast for at least
[28597.49s -> 28599.49s]  Whether it's somewhere in vegas
[28600.13s -> 28602.13s]  over the night over the years or
[28602.94s -> 28604.94s]  I don't know. I want to be on the west coast
[28605.10s -> 28607.97s]  I'll be in vegas for a while though. That's for certain
[28608.61s -> 28617.54s]  That random guy cursed me. Yeah, I didn't buy the I gotta buy that fiber curse removal. You're right
[28623.52s -> 28627.22s]  fiber
[28627.22s -> 28629.22s]  We also had
[28632.10s -> 28635.48s]  All that money came in the 69 subs from phylactery
[28636.85s -> 28638.85s]  three dollars from cyan tf2
[28639.33s -> 28643.41s]  Holy shit. This man gave 500 bits. That's insane
[28644.56s -> 28646.56s]  If you decide to give me a cent
[28647.50s -> 28649.98s]  Then it's as appreciated as anything else
[28650.78s -> 28652.78s]  If you decide to give this channel any money
[28653.34s -> 28656.30s]  It's not just a thousand dollars of somebody donating
[28657.50s -> 28663.58s]  Or supporting subs too, there's a lot of consistent subs on this channel more than I ever could have possibly imagined
[28664.38s -> 28666.30s]  so it's not just
[28666.30s -> 28670.78s]  The people dropping the 500 bucks as much as that's amazing and insane for me
[28672.30s -> 28678.46s]  It's not just that so don't feel like oh shit. I only gave three dollars today. Fuck
[28678.86s -> 28682.46s]  No, that's I don't that I do not feel that that's I do not feel that way
[28682.46s -> 28683.90s]  Okay
[28683.90s -> 28687.39s]  There's no cent equivalent of a bit. I think it's 25 cents minimum, right?
[28688.27s -> 28691.31s]  Has to prevent people from just doing one cent spam with the thing
[28692.19s -> 28694.59s]  Right, so you could just have the chat be filled with the symbol
[28697.78s -> 28700.90s]  And speaking of subs, there's another five from kazi
[28702.34s -> 28708.35s]  Kazi 101 five community subs. Thank you. Kazi five more subs from the subway
[28709.65s -> 28712.48s]  No, for real. You guys are too good
[28713.12s -> 28715.41s]  You guys are too good to me
[28715.41s -> 28719.65s]  Just glad you still think that it's fun to be in the channel and i'm glad you still this many years later
[28719.65s -> 28724.16s]  I've been doing this for a long time
[28724.16s -> 28727.92s]  A lot of times when people do this kind of shit for a long fucking time
[28728.80s -> 28730.80s]  You know, wow, it's
[28730.96s -> 28738.24s]  Hey, here we go. What? Well, I started youtube um eight plus years ago. Whoa, this is a roller coaster
[28738.64s -> 28740.56s]  This is so cool
[28740.56s -> 28743.76s]  Five years six years. Oh, okay. I have seven years. Uh
[28744.80s -> 28749.36s]  This is you I you guys are still fucking doing this you guys are still going
[28750.46s -> 28752.46s]  and I don't know I i'm
[28755.15s -> 28757.87s]  Shocked that i've still been able to do this
[28762.99s -> 28764.99s]  It's been a long fucking time
[28765.94s -> 28768.34s]  So take things like the carnival stream
[28769.14s -> 28775.22s]  As my way of the kind of saying thank you and hopefully then we can make have a fun time. It doesn't matter
[28775.86s -> 28777.30s]  If that stream
[28777.30s -> 28780.26s]  Is oh how much was that stream expensive who gives a shit?
[28781.39s -> 28784.45s]  Who gives a shit?
[28784.45s -> 28786.90s]  You know what I mean?
[28786.90s -> 28792.85s]  It's it's worth doing
[28792.85s -> 28796.69s]  I mean that
[28796.69s -> 28798.61s]  He's getting better with age
[28798.61s -> 28802.40s]  We'll see
[28802.40s -> 28804.40s]  But we're reaching the end here
[28804.96s -> 28807.84s]  we had a phylactery lich gave five dollars
[28808.88s -> 28811.38s]  and they say
[28811.38s -> 28814.50s]  Seriously, I give all these bits and subs because you're my primary entertainment
[28814.82s -> 28819.46s]  And I never want to stop watching your funny ass streams involved 69 subs was for the meme
[28819.54s -> 28823.94s]  But next time i'll do 420 not tonight though because we're about to leave
[28825.70s -> 28827.06s]  4
[28827.06s -> 28828.74s]  420
[28828.74s -> 28830.16s]  sub
[28830.16s -> 28835.68s]  I think that's we're not doing that tonight though. Hold on to that one
[28836.24s -> 28839.04s]  Because that's fucking like thousands of dollars
[28841.42s -> 28845.10s]  Thank you, though. I really appreciate that. I'm humbled to be your primary entertainment
[28847.76s -> 28850.40s]  That would like kill the chat it would be like
[28851.44s -> 28853.44s]  It would just be flying by
[28856.13s -> 28857.41s]  But thank you
[28857.41s -> 28859.62s]  I really appreciate it

[28865.84s -> 28867.38s]  thankfully
[28867.38s -> 28871.46s]  Uh, there's other people involved that can help with that if you talk about the carnival thing
[28872.34s -> 28874.34s]  I have things that I specifically want
[28875.42s -> 28882.30s]  That there are two companies involved. So I have told that we on paper and I spent we I spent a long time
[28882.62s -> 28884.86s]  On this remember I told you i've been dialing streams back
[28885.82s -> 28888.22s]  My streams have been
[28888.22s -> 28890.86s]  Instead of three or four times a week. It's like two or three times a week now
[28893.68s -> 28899.76s]  And I obviously want to stay by the book twitch actually keeps a really good track of what's coming out and coming in
[28900.16s -> 28905.92s]  So it's not just oh i have to go through this and see if they they keep it a pretty good track of it. So
[28907.36s -> 28913.82s]  That voice thing. Yeah, that's
[28914.78s -> 28917.10s]  That's old news
[28917.10s -> 28919.10s]  And it's fucking still sounds good
[28919.34s -> 28927.82s]  It still sounds fucking just as good as it did when I made it fucking 12 15 years ago
[28932.08s -> 28936.51s]  Yeah, it was like that's like more than 10 15 years old
[28937.68s -> 28939.52s]  And I still got it
[28939.52s -> 28945.79s]  Was that before I played tf2? That was that was like before I went to college
[28948.85s -> 28950.45s]  That was a long time ago
[28950.45s -> 28961.74s]  Why does the profile say that you're a teenager adult male senior male and old male? No, that's like what i'm capable of
[28962.86s -> 28965.46s]  That's what i'm capable of
[28965.46s -> 28968.26s]  That's what i'm capable of that's what i'm capable of
[28968.90s -> 28973.94s]  That is what i'm capable of and if you don't think that that was every entire spectrum of age
[28980.98s -> 28983.54s]  It was anyways guys

[28999.39s -> 29001.39s]  Uh, that's going to be the time here
[29001.71s -> 29003.71s]  I did not expect this to be an eight-hour stream, but it is
[29004.77s -> 29009.97s]  We've done some long ones recently. This is another long one. I'm going to see what star is up to tomorrow
[29011.07s -> 29015.31s]  And maybe there'll be terraria tomorrow if his computer is working. That was a problem before
[29016.54s -> 29019.50s]  I'm gonna go take a shower. I'm gonna get some food and i'm gonna get some rest

[29041.63s -> 29045.87s]  Sorry for the internet problems that really sucks. Nonetheless, we'll be here through it all
[29048.50s -> 29056.32s]  Thank you the internet is just in the united states
[29056.94s -> 29060.80s]  Unfortunately, you kind of just throw dice in the air if you're going to have a good stable upload connection
[29060.88s -> 29062.88s]  That's just the way it works. It's like that everywhere
[29064.00s -> 29067.20s]  Some people don't have a problem at all. Some people have more problems than they can
[29067.76s -> 29069.76s]  Deal with and it sucks
[29070.48s -> 29076.10s]  Because having unstable internet, it's one thing dropping like a thousand two thousand frames of stream is pretty normal
[29077.62s -> 29081.34s]  But thank you
[29081.34s -> 29086.37s]  And finally garfy the monday killer germ the worm. You didn't click on garf's links. Oh shit in the other right?

[29105.01s -> 29107.81s]  Consider this a pitch to you in a trailer for the audience
[29109.09s -> 29110.53s]  Here we go
[29110.61s -> 29128.27s]  It's a trailer

[29199.50s -> 29202.86s]  If I have time, maybe I would throw in a few lines or something
[29203.34s -> 29206.64s]  The only problem is i'm not going to have very much time until after september
[29208.93s -> 29211.49s]  Because of these a couple of streams, especially the carnival
[29213.81s -> 29218.48s]  Looked really interesting though
