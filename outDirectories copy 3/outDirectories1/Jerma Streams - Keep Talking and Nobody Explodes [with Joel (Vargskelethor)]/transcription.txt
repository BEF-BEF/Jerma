[1.59s -> 9.81s]  What's up everybody? We are live, yes we are.
[9.81s -> 14.50s]  Sorry, I have to move over here to my battle station.
[14.50s -> 20.80s]  I had to set my microphone and cameras up for this stream.
[20.80s -> 26.79s]  And we're all set. Go back offline.
[26.79s -> 36.17s]  That's the second day in a row. Okay, that's the second day in a row that I have read.
[36.17s -> 41.66s]  Within 30 seconds of the stream starting, somebody say,
[41.66s -> 44.66s]  Get the fuck out of here. Turn off your stream. And I go, turn off my stream.
[44.66s -> 46.66s]  What are you talking about, man? What?
[46.66s -> 51.31s]  I don't know why. I have no idea.
[51.31s -> 55.31s]  Anyways, today is going to be sort of a fun stream, I hope.
[55.31s -> 61.31s]  It depends on how good Joel and I are at communicating instructions.
[61.31s -> 67.11s]  We're going to play keep talking and nobody explodes.
[67.11s -> 72.77s]  I have, well, I'll just show you.
[72.77s -> 74.77s]  Well, hold on, hold on.
[74.77s -> 78.77s]  Joel just started the stream too, so let's let people trickle in for a little bit.
[78.77s -> 80.77s]  Make sure I got my copy in the right place.
[80.77s -> 82.77s]  Give me one second.
[82.77s -> 138.98s]  Alright, so take a look at my setup here.
[138.98s -> 143.97s]  Well, the stream is not over, don't worry.
[143.97s -> 150.72s]  So I've got for you here my battle station.
[150.72s -> 154.09s]  I printed this shit out. I'm ready to go.
[154.09s -> 156.09s]  I'm not messing around.
[156.09s -> 158.58s]  I've got my guide.
[158.58s -> 161.58s]  As you see, bomb defusal manual.
[161.58s -> 163.58s]  I've just got to lean over a little.
[163.58s -> 165.58s]  I am ready.
[165.58s -> 167.58s]  I told you I was taking this fucking dead serious.
[167.58s -> 169.89s]  Dead serious today.
[169.89s -> 174.28s]  And you can see, look at this. Take a look at this.
[174.28s -> 179.25s]  You can actually read along with me if you want to.
[179.25s -> 183.00s]  That's good. Looks like it's not blocking the way.
[183.00s -> 185.00s]  There's my bomb defusal manual.
[185.00s -> 187.00s]  Joel has one of these too.
[187.00s -> 191.10s]  So wait, you can't even hear the music.
[191.10s -> 194.04s]  Joel has one of these too.
[194.04s -> 197.04s]  We did a trial run before the stream turned on.
[197.04s -> 199.60s]  And we did alright.
[199.60s -> 201.60s]  We did okay.
[201.60s -> 209.39s]  Shave. Get out of here.
[209.39s -> 212.46s]  How can you even tell?
[212.46s -> 216.24s]  How can you even tell?
[216.24s -> 218.24s]  I have like a spooky ghost light on me.
[218.24s -> 220.24s]  How can you tell that I need to shave?
[220.24s -> 222.24s]  It just looks like a little bit of scrub.
[222.24s -> 227.55s]  How can you tell?
[227.55s -> 232.22s]  It looked like Jesus.
[232.22s -> 234.59s]  If Jesus was around today,
[234.59s -> 236.59s]  he'd have the most followed Twitter account.
[236.59s -> 240.86s]  That's okay with me. He's a pretty fucking big deal.
[240.86s -> 242.86s]  Alright, so let's see. Is Joel ready?
[242.86s -> 253.65s]  Is his stream on?
[253.65s -> 261.48s]  He just went BRB.
[261.48s -> 263.48s]  Wait, hold on. His stream is not on?
[263.48s -> 265.48s]  Yes it is.
[265.48s -> 269.13s]  What are you talking about?
[269.13s -> 272.97s]  His stream's not turned on?
[272.97s -> 274.97s]  No, he's on. He's on. He's on.
[274.97s -> 285.91s]  See?
[285.91s -> 287.91s]  We have to do the squad stream thing because
[287.91s -> 289.91s]  we're going to have two different...
[289.91s -> 291.91s]  When I'm doing the bomb stuff,
[291.91s -> 293.91s]  our screens are going to be completely different.
[293.91s -> 299.16s]  Why did he leave the call?
[299.16s -> 303.24s]  Important question.
[303.24s -> 305.24s]  Who is a better music producer?
[305.24s -> 307.24s]  I don't know who any of...
[307.24s -> 309.24s]  Neither of those people are. I have no idea.
[309.24s -> 313.40s]  Alright, what's he doing?
[313.40s -> 322.81s]  Joel, what are you up to?
[322.81s -> 324.81s]  See, this is my own... Alright, let me tell you something.
[324.81s -> 326.81s]  This is my own damn fault.
[326.81s -> 329.18s]  When I start a stream,
[329.18s -> 331.18s]  I'm just like...
[331.18s -> 333.18s]  I have an intro screen, and the intro screen plays.
[333.18s -> 335.18s]  Right?
[335.18s -> 337.18s]  And then, I sit there for one minute, and then I go...
[337.18s -> 339.93s]  Okay, it's time to start streaming now.
[339.93s -> 341.93s]  I'm like, I've got time to go. Let's go.
[341.93s -> 343.93s]  I don't give any fucking time.
[343.93s -> 346.36s]  And some... I always just...
[346.36s -> 348.36s]  Not even two minutes will go by.
[348.36s -> 351.24s]  I just sit there because...
[351.24s -> 353.24s]  Yeah, ADHD.
[353.24s -> 355.24s]  It just takes over my whole body.
[355.24s -> 357.24s]  Because I'm looking at... I'm here. I'm just here.
[357.24s -> 359.24s]  And I'm seeing the screen. I'm seeing people chatting.
[359.24s -> 362.50s]  I'm just going like...
[362.50s -> 365.70s]  I want to... Let's go.
[365.70s -> 373.19s]  Fucking five year old. What is that thing in your camera?
[373.19s -> 375.94s]  What are you talking about? The thing in my camera.
[375.94s -> 383.50s]  What? What thing?
[383.50s -> 389.37s]  Five, six thing.
[389.37s -> 391.37s]  Five, seven. Don't fucking get it wrong.
[391.37s -> 393.37s]  That thing.
[393.37s -> 395.37s]  Oh, this thing.
[395.37s -> 397.86s]  This is this camera.
[397.86s -> 399.86s]  This is this camera.
[399.86s -> 401.86s]  I have like a...
[401.86s -> 406.28s]  I have like a periscope.
[406.28s -> 408.28s]  This is one of those scenarios where
[408.28s -> 410.28s]  I'm going to fall down on this stream,
[410.28s -> 412.28s]  and this is going to go through my fucking eye.
[412.28s -> 414.46s]  It's like...
[414.46s -> 416.95s]  It's like...
[416.95s -> 419.90s]  Everyone's now going,
[419.90s -> 424.18s]  oh, please don't do that.
[424.18s -> 426.18s]  Oh, okay, he's almost ready.
[426.18s -> 430.86s]  He's almost ready.
[430.86s -> 433.99s]  We spoiled the joke.
[433.99s -> 435.99s]  Me putting my head through
[435.99s -> 437.99s]  is... What do you mean a joke?
[437.99s -> 439.99s]  That would be a disaster. That would be a horrible thing that would happen to me.
[439.99s -> 444.92s]  Alright, look.
[444.92s -> 446.92s]  Alright, here you go.
[446.92s -> 449.10s]  Alright, hold on.
[449.10s -> 481.03s]  I'm going to be...
[481.03s -> 483.03s]  You know when you wait for the bus
[483.03s -> 485.03s]  and you got there way too early
[485.03s -> 488.23s]  and you realize
[488.23s -> 490.23s]  that the next bus is coming in like
[490.23s -> 492.98s]  30 minutes,
[492.98s -> 495.16s]  and you go, fuck.
[495.16s -> 497.16s]  I mean...
[497.16s -> 499.16s]  This is the way that I am when the bus
[499.16s -> 501.16s]  is coming.
[501.16s -> 503.16s]  Walking around, just looking at stuff.
[503.16s -> 505.16s]  You look at the same ad on the side of the bus stop
[505.16s -> 507.16s]  like a thousand times.
[507.16s -> 510.74s]  You just pace around.
[510.74s -> 512.74s]  You're like, alright, that bus will be here in 30 minutes.
[512.74s -> 516.01s]  My phone...
[516.01s -> 518.01s]  My phone is not even interesting.
[518.01s -> 520.01s]  I hate that shit.
[520.01s -> 522.01s]  When your phone is not interesting,
[522.01s -> 524.31s]  that's when it's the worst waiting.
[524.31s -> 526.31s]  You can't even open up your phone
[526.31s -> 528.31s]  and do anything because
[528.31s -> 530.31s]  nothing on this phone is interesting.
[530.31s -> 532.31s]  I've already seen these tweets a thousand times.
[532.31s -> 541.08s]  I've been to Reddit twice.
[541.08s -> 543.45s]  I wrote 25 comments.
[543.45s -> 553.10s]  I hate waiting.
[553.10s -> 555.10s]  Hey Jervis, so don't we when you're late
[555.10s -> 560.86s]  all the fucking time.
[560.86s -> 563.54s]  Oh, shit.
[563.54s -> 565.54s]  Oh.
[565.54s -> 567.54s]  I got myself. I fell in my own trap there.
[567.54s -> 569.54s]  I stepped on a rake
[569.54s -> 571.54s]  in the backyard and it hit me right in the fucking face.
[571.54s -> 575.64s]  I don't have front teeth anymore.
[575.64s -> 582.92s]  Alright.
[582.92s -> 606.60s]  Let's fucking go.
[606.60s -> 609.35s]  And then, when the bus
[609.35s -> 611.35s]  actually shows up...
[611.35s -> 613.35s]  When the bus shows up... Oh, hold on. I'm sorry. I'm going over something.
[613.35s -> 615.85s]  Alright. When the bus
[615.85s -> 617.85s]  actually shows up and you look at the top
[617.85s -> 619.85s]  text on the bus and it's not
[619.85s -> 621.85s]  for where you're fucking going.
[621.85s -> 623.85s]  It's the complete opposite side of town.
[623.85s -> 625.85s]  And you're like, god damn it. I have to wait for another
[625.85s -> 627.85s]  20 minutes. I thought it was 30. Alright.
[627.85s -> 629.85s]  How you doing? You ready? Yeah.
[629.85s -> 631.85s]  I'm good. I'm good. Go.
[631.85s -> 633.85s]  You ready to defuse some bombs?
[633.85s -> 636.02s]  I hope so.
[636.02s -> 638.46s]  Yeah, me too.
[638.46s -> 640.46s]  So you want to go first?
[640.46s -> 642.46s]  How do you want to do this? You fucking read.
[642.46s -> 644.46s]  I'll read first. Alright. Listen.
[644.46s -> 646.46s]  I'm not self-deprecating but I'm saying
[646.46s -> 648.46s]  if I start fucking reading manuals right
[648.46s -> 650.46s]  now
[650.46s -> 652.46s]  I might as well be reading a fucking Arby's menu.
[652.46s -> 654.46s]  Alright. I'm not going to get shit done.
[654.46s -> 656.46s]  You have to read. I have to do this.
[656.46s -> 658.46s]  Okay. I think I can handle it.
[658.46s -> 660.46s]  Alright.
[660.46s -> 662.46s]  We did do this once.
[662.46s -> 664.46s]  And god damn it. This is gonna
[664.46s -> 666.46s]  hurt me. Alright.
[666.46s -> 668.46s]  Now it's all like this is a gun pointing at me.
[668.46s -> 670.46s]  Ugh. This is a gun pointing at me.
[670.46s -> 672.46s]  Listen. The core principle
[672.46s -> 674.46s]  of defusing bombs are like
[674.46s -> 676.46s]  handling stuff under pressure.
[676.46s -> 678.46s]  I've come to learn that
[678.46s -> 680.46s]  you can always rely on chat.
[680.46s -> 682.46s]  Chat always knows how to handle these situations.
[682.46s -> 684.46s]  Chat should really be
[684.46s -> 686.46s]  the bomb experts in this case.
[686.46s -> 688.46s]  So what we're going to do in case this gets a little
[688.46s -> 690.46s]  hard, you guys are going to have to spit
[690.46s -> 692.46s]  instructions at us and I'm sure that
[692.46s -> 694.46s]  with your expertise and
[694.46s -> 696.46s]  our lack of, we're going to have
[696.46s -> 698.46s]  an excellent stream that's not going to be going down
[698.46s -> 700.46s]  as the worst stream of 2020 already.
[700.46s -> 702.63s]  So
[702.63s -> 705.70s]  you ready to do this?
[705.70s -> 707.70s]  Hey. Look. Joel.
[707.70s -> 709.70s]  We're starting all the way at the bottom.
[709.70s -> 711.70s]  We're starting at the bottom.
[711.70s -> 713.70s]  So there's no way this could be the worst
[713.70s -> 715.70s]  stream of 2020. Like as
[715.70s -> 717.70s]  long as this is even 5% better
[717.70s -> 719.70s]  than the Halo. Jeremy this is already the worst stream
[719.70s -> 721.94s]  that we've ever done.
[721.94s -> 726.22s]  Alright. Are you ready?
[726.22s -> 728.22s]  I'm fucking ready. Wait. Wait.
[728.22s -> 730.22s]  We have to squad stream. Oh yeah.
[730.22s -> 732.22s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We gotta
[732.22s -> 734.22s]  you know. Cause guys people are only going to see
[734.22s -> 737.86s]  the manual on mine.
[737.86s -> 741.00s]  Let's see here. Somebody
[741.00s -> 743.00s]  just goes worst stream of the 21st
[743.00s -> 745.00s]  century.
[745.00s -> 748.01s]  Alright. I invited you to a
[748.01s -> 750.01s]  squad stream. Squad up.
[750.01s -> 752.01s]  So what will happen is you're going to get
[752.01s -> 754.01s]  two Twitch
[754.01s -> 756.01s]  screens on both channels and you're going to get
[756.01s -> 758.01s]  to choose which one you want. Screens or screams.
[758.01s -> 760.38s]  Alright. You get it?
[760.38s -> 762.68s]  I'm ready to go.
[762.68s -> 764.68s]  Alright. It says invite send.
[764.68s -> 766.68s]  Are we even in squads?
[766.68s -> 768.68s]  Are we squading up? Are we let's going?
[768.68s -> 770.92s]  I don't know if I see it but are
[770.92s -> 772.92s]  you guys seeing it? Do you guys see?
[772.92s -> 777.46s]  No. No. That one
[777.46s -> 779.46s]  that one ain't going where I want to go.
[779.46s -> 781.46s]  It just drove by. Fuck.
[781.46s -> 786.20s]  No? What do you mean no?
[786.20s -> 788.50s]  Listen guys. We're trying to diffuse bombs here.
[788.50s -> 790.50s]  Alright. Alright. You send me
[790.50s -> 797.54s]  an invite. Okay.
[797.54s -> 799.54s]  You know what's the funniest thing? Sometimes when I try to like
[799.54s -> 801.85s]  I just want to like
[801.85s -> 803.85s]  send you tweets or whatever stuff.
[803.85s -> 805.85s]  I forget what your name is.
[805.85s -> 807.85s]  I know your name is like Bob or whatever but
[807.85s -> 809.85s]  the thing is like you have these
[809.85s -> 811.85s]  three last numbers. I'm just like Jerma 900.
[811.85s -> 813.85s]  Jerma 800 like
[813.85s -> 816.73s]  Alright. Let's fucking
[816.73s -> 818.73s]  go Joel. I'm ready. Alright.
[818.73s -> 821.93s]  We're squatted up.
[821.93s -> 824.30s]  Alright. I'm going to turn off this monitor.
[824.30s -> 826.79s]  You got control right? Yeah.
[826.79s -> 828.79s]  Yeah. Alright. Monitor off.
[828.79s -> 831.22s]  I'm ready. Are you
[831.22s -> 833.22s]  fucking ready for the stream
[833.22s -> 835.22s]  2020 to define
[835.22s -> 837.22s]  the 20s. The roaring
[837.22s -> 839.22s]  20s. Alright. If you don't know how this game
[839.22s -> 841.22s]  works. We have
[841.22s -> 843.22s]  five minutes to diffuse a bomb where I can't
[843.22s -> 845.22s]  see what he's doing. I have to give him
[845.22s -> 847.22s]  instructions on what he has to do.
[847.22s -> 849.22s]  And he can't see anything.
[849.22s -> 853.13s]  Just open the fucking game.
[853.13s -> 855.13s]  Alright. Hold on. Should I
[855.13s -> 857.13s]  mute this? No. Does that
[857.13s -> 859.13s]  matter? No. No. No. No.
[859.13s -> 861.13s]  Alright.
[861.13s -> 863.13s]  I was taking control of the game.
[863.13s -> 865.13s]  Alright. Listen. Listen. I
[865.13s -> 867.13s]  I'm on Jerma's computer. I get to see all
[867.13s -> 869.13s]  the desktop porn. Alright. Listen.
[869.13s -> 871.13s]  Feel sorry for me. I didn't give you
[871.13s -> 873.13s]  access to the fucking keyboard. So
[873.13s -> 876.70s]  Sure about that?
[876.70s -> 879.83s]  Listen. Do not look at the screen.
[879.83s -> 881.83s]  I will. I got
[881.83s -> 883.83s]  like my last like six years of
[883.83s -> 885.83s]  tax returns on my desktop. Don't fucking show
[885.83s -> 887.83s]  it. Alright. Maybe

[898.07s -> 900.07s]  Okay. So. We got a yellow wire.
[900.07s -> 902.07s]  A white wire. A red wire. And a blue
[902.07s -> 904.07s]  wire. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Modules.
[904.07s -> 906.07s]  Okay. On the subject of wires.
[906.07s -> 908.07s]  How many wires are there? There are
[908.07s -> 910.07s]  four wires. Four wires. Okay.
[910.07s -> 912.07s]  Is there
[912.07s -> 914.07s]  any red wires? There's one red
[914.07s -> 916.07s]  wire. Okay. Is there more than
[916.07s -> 918.07s]  is there two red wires? There's
[918.07s -> 920.07s]  just one color. There's
[920.07s -> 922.07s]  one yellow, one white, one red, one blue.
[922.07s -> 924.07s]  Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Okay. Hold on.
[924.07s -> 926.07s]  Nope. Don't argue.
[926.07s -> 928.07s]  Don't argue. I can hear the noise and it's freaking
[928.07s -> 930.07s]  me out. Alright. If there how many
[930.07s -> 932.07s]  Wait. Is the last wire yellow?
[932.07s -> 934.07s]  No. I need to talk to you.
[934.07s -> 936.63s]  Alright. Hold on.
[936.63s -> 938.63s]  There's no red wires.
[938.63s -> 940.63s]  There's one red. I fucking said that.
[940.63s -> 942.63s]  There's only one red
[942.63s -> 944.63s]  wire. There's one red wire. Okay.
[944.63s -> 946.63s]  Alright. Is the last wire
[946.63s -> 949.26s]  yellow? No. It's blue.
[949.26s -> 951.26s]  Okay. Is there one blue wire?
[951.26s -> 953.86s]  There's
[953.86s -> 955.86s]  Is there one blue wire? I'm gonna fucking come over to Boston
[955.86s -> 957.86s]  and I'm gonna fucking. I don't even live there anymore
[957.86s -> 959.86s]  man. Alright. I'm fucking
[959.86s -> 961.86s]  Alright. Is there one?
[961.86s -> 963.86s]  Yes or no? Is there one blue wire?
[963.86s -> 966.04s]  Third fucking time
[966.04s -> 968.04s]  blue wire. Say it. Is it one blue?
[968.04s -> 970.04s]  Okay. Then cut. There's one blue wire.
[970.04s -> 972.04s]  Cut the first wire. Cut the first wire.
[972.04s -> 977.99s]  Did you cut it? Yeah. Yeah.
[977.99s -> 979.99s]  I don't know how to.
[979.99s -> 981.99s]  Okay. What's next? What else? What else?
[981.99s -> 983.99s]  Okay. Then we have a
[983.99s -> 985.99s]  second module. It's a keypad
[985.99s -> 987.99s]  looking thing, right? Keypad looking thing.
[987.99s -> 989.99s]  With the symbols?
[989.99s -> 991.99s]  The first one is like an X with a little schadoodle
[991.99s -> 993.99s]  underneath it. Okay.
[993.99s -> 996.23s]  X with a little. Just go. Okay.
[996.23s -> 998.23s]  It's like a
[998.23s -> 1000.23s]  really badly looking K
[1000.23s -> 1002.23s]  or an X. Okay. It's a bad K.
[1002.23s -> 1004.23s]  With a schadoodle underneath it. It's a bad K with a schadoodle
[1004.23s -> 1006.23s]  underneath. It's like a
[1006.23s -> 1008.23s]  cursive kind of looking K. It's not an X.
[1008.23s -> 1010.23s]  Is it an H? Is it an H?
[1010.23s -> 1012.23s]  Does it look like an H? Yeah. You can
[1012.23s -> 1014.23s]  say that. Yeah. Sure. Okay. So
[1014.23s -> 1016.23s]  it's. Okay. What else?
[1016.23s -> 1018.23s]  Then you have an upside down question mark.
[1018.23s -> 1020.23s]  Upside down question mark. Okay.
[1020.23s -> 1022.23s]  Then you have a drooling O. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1022.23s -> 1024.23s]  Could that also be an upside down
[1024.23s -> 1026.73s]  9-2?
[1026.73s -> 1028.73s]  Uh, no.
[1028.73s -> 1030.73s]  I don't see any upside down question marks here.
[1030.73s -> 1032.73s]  Yes, I do. Okay. What else? What else? What else?
[1032.73s -> 1034.73s]  Rifle. Rifle. Rifle. A drooling O.
[1034.73s -> 1036.73s]  An O that's drooling. Okay. Yep. What else?
[1036.73s -> 1038.73s]  Okay. Then you have
[1038.73s -> 1040.73s]  a backwards E with two dots.
[1040.73s -> 1042.73s]  It's like a swede
[1042.73s -> 1044.73s]  rodent E. Okay. Alright.
[1044.73s -> 1048.38s]  Press the backwards E first.
[1048.38s -> 1050.38s]  Okay. Then the drooling O.
[1050.38s -> 1053.32s]  And then the H with the
[1053.32s -> 1055.56s]  squiggly. And then the upside down question mark.
[1055.56s -> 1057.56s]  We got it. Got it.
[1057.56s -> 1059.56s]  Alright. Is that it? What else?
[1059.56s -> 1061.56s]  That's pretty much it. What do you mean that's it?
[1061.56s -> 1064.12s]  Why is it still ticking?
[1064.12s -> 1066.12s]  You got the big old button. Big old button.
[1066.12s -> 1070.02s]  Alright.
[1070.02s -> 1072.02s]  Follow these rules in the order that they are listed. Perform
[1072.02s -> 1074.02s]  the first action that applies. Alright.
[1074.02s -> 1076.02s]  What color is the button?
[1076.02s -> 1078.20s]  White. It's a white button. Okay.
[1078.20s -> 1080.20s]  We don't have less than a
[1080.20s -> 1082.20s]  Just a minute now. Alright. If the button
[1082.20s -> 1084.20s]  is white and there is a lit
[1084.20s -> 1086.20s]  indicator with a lit. What does it say on it?
[1086.20s -> 1088.70s]  Abort. It says abort. Okay.
[1088.70s -> 1090.70s]  If there's
[1090.70s -> 1092.70s]  If there's
[1092.70s -> 1094.70s]  If the button is yellow, if the button is red, and the button says hold.
[1094.70s -> 1096.70s]  If none of the apply, hold the button and refer to releasing.
[1096.70s -> 1099.38s]  Wait. So where's the board?
[1099.38s -> 1101.38s]  Does it say abort anywhere?
[1101.38s -> 1103.38s]  How much time do I have? On the fucking button.
[1103.38s -> 1105.38s]  Bright fucking Las Vegas letters
[1105.38s -> 1107.38s]  blinking at me. Why? Why? It's like
[1107.38s -> 1109.38s]  stuff coming. Okay. Hold the button down.
[1109.38s -> 1111.38s]  Okay. And then
[1111.38s -> 1113.38s]  If you start holding the button down, a colored strip
[1113.38s -> 1115.38s]  will light up on the right side of the module.
[1115.38s -> 1117.38s]  Based on its color, you must release the button
[1117.38s -> 1119.38s]  at a specific point in time. What color?
[1119.38s -> 1121.38s]  Blue. Release when the countdown
[1121.38s -> 1123.38s]  timer has any four in any position.
[1123.38s -> 1126.26s]  Any four?
[1126.26s -> 1128.26s]  Yeah. Four in any position. Let it go
[1128.26s -> 1130.26s]  when it's at four. In any position. Okay.
[1130.26s -> 1134.36s]  Okay. We did it!
[1134.36s -> 1136.73s]  We did it! You didn't think we were going to get one.
[1136.73s -> 1138.73s]  You didn't think we were going to get one.
[1138.73s -> 1140.73s]  You didn't think we were going to get one. You didn't think
[1140.73s -> 1143.35s]  we were going to get one. Listen. Listen.
[1143.35s -> 1145.35s]  Here's the thing about being a
[1145.35s -> 1147.35s]  miracle man, right? You have to like
[1147.35s -> 1149.85s]  underperform. You have to tell
[1149.85s -> 1151.85s]  people that it's going to be awful.
[1151.85s -> 1153.85s]  And then you have to do a slight effort.
[1153.85s -> 1155.85s]  And then people are like, wow, they are geniuses.
[1155.85s -> 1157.85s]  I couldn't believe that. I doubted them.
[1157.85s -> 1159.85s]  You know. That's the power.
[1159.85s -> 1161.85s]  That's the power of lying. Alright?
[1161.85s -> 1163.85s]  Okay. That's being a
[1163.85s -> 1165.85s]  gamer. That's what being a gamer is all about.
[1165.85s -> 1167.85s]  You guys doubted us.
[1167.85s -> 1169.85s]  You guys said, oh, colossal
[1169.85s -> 1171.85s]  brain. You said dumb and
[1171.85s -> 1173.85s]  dumper. Alright. Uh-uh. Listen.
[1173.85s -> 1175.85s]  Mario and Luigi. Listen.
[1175.85s -> 1177.85s]  We can do this.
[1177.85s -> 1179.85s]  Joel, that was level one. This is one of many.
[1179.85s -> 1182.60s]  I don't want to
[1182.60s -> 1184.60s]  step on your, uh, I don't want to
[1184.60s -> 1186.60s]  rain on your parade here. That was level one.
[1186.60s -> 1189.42s]  Are you ready to do level two?
[1189.42s -> 1191.42s]  That doesn't, that doesn't matter.
[1191.42s -> 1193.42s]  We got this, man. Alright. There's so much in here
[1193.42s -> 1195.42s]  too. This is like a thick ass book. Alright.
[1195.42s -> 1197.42s]  Here's the thing though. Here's the thing though.
[1197.42s -> 1199.42s]  I noticed there's a problem already.
[1199.42s -> 1201.42s]  You're yelling at me.
[1201.42s -> 1203.42s]  You were yelling at me.
[1203.42s -> 1205.42s]  You're yelling at me. You're being
[1205.42s -> 1207.78s]  unnecessarily
[1207.78s -> 1210.02s]  aggressive. How
[1210.02s -> 1212.84s]  Listen, next time you start yelling at
[1212.84s -> 1214.84s]  me, there's going to be consequences.
[1214.84s -> 1216.84s]  Oh, consequences. Oh no.
[1216.84s -> 1218.84s]  Consequences.
[1218.84s -> 1222.79s]  Are you ready for the second one?
[1222.79s -> 1224.79s]  Excuse me? Are you ready for the second one?
[1224.79s -> 1226.79s]  Are you ready for the second one?
[1226.79s -> 1229.16s]  I'm ready. I'm ready.
[1229.16s -> 1231.53s]  Okay.
[1231.53s -> 1234.34s]  Where is, uh,
[1234.34s -> 1237.16s]  where's the second bomb at?
[1237.16s -> 1239.16s]  I kind of feel fucking like shit right now. Alright.
[1239.16s -> 1241.16s]  Uh, second bomb should be the next one.
[1241.16s -> 1244.09s]  Uh,
[1244.09s -> 1247.42s]  free play? No, this is, is it all
[1247.42s -> 1249.42s]  like level two?
[1249.42s -> 1251.42s]  I can't find level two. Let me turn on my monitor.
[1251.42s -> 1253.42s]  That's the first bomb. Alright, first, that was the first
[1253.42s -> 1255.42s]  bomb. So let me turn on my monitor and help you out here.
[1255.42s -> 1257.42s]  Oh, no, no, no. Okay. Never mind.
[1257.42s -> 1259.42s]  Never mind. Never mind. I, I, we can do
[1259.42s -> 1261.42s]  this. Okay. Sorry. Sorry guys.
[1261.42s -> 1263.78s]  Listen, listen, listen.
[1263.78s -> 1265.78s]  Maybe you guys are the bomb. I guess you guys are fucking
[1265.78s -> 1267.78s]  yelling at me now. What are you looking at?
[1267.78s -> 1269.78s]  You see, you see, you are the challenge.
[1269.78s -> 1271.78s]  You are the challenge right now. Alright.
[1271.78s -> 1273.78s]  Listen, I'm all blind.
[1273.78s -> 1275.78s]  I'm being gamer.
[1275.78s -> 1277.78s]  You see, I'm inviting you in. I said
[1277.78s -> 1279.78s]  that when I just won. The thing about this
[1279.78s -> 1281.78s]  is I underperform.
[1281.78s -> 1283.78s]  You guys don't expect this, but when we actually get into this
[1283.78s -> 1285.78s]  we're gonna soup through everything.
[1285.78s -> 1287.78s]  Alright. Okay.
[1287.78s -> 1289.78s]  Let's fucking soup
[1289.78s -> 1291.78s]  through everything. What do you, I don't know what that means.
[1291.78s -> 1293.78s]  Alright, let me turn on my monitor. Sometimes I say
[1293.78s -> 1295.78s]  I don't mean anything. They just like phonetically like imply
[1295.78s -> 1297.78s]  things. Like, you know, soup is like
[1297.78s -> 1300.22s]  you know.
[1300.22s -> 1302.22s]  I still have ink on my hands. This is fresh print.
[1302.22s -> 1304.22s]  You have ink on your hands?
[1304.22s -> 1306.22s]  Yeah. I printed this like 40 minutes
[1306.22s -> 1308.22s]  ago and like the ink is coming off my hands.
[1308.22s -> 1310.65s]  Taste it.
[1310.65s -> 1312.65s]  No. Why did I give that one second
[1312.65s -> 1314.65s]  of thought? Why would I give that even one second
[1314.65s -> 1317.40s]  thought? But listen,
[1317.40s -> 1319.40s]  listen, it might like sharpen you out. Like
[1319.40s -> 1321.40s]  tell you, here's an added challenge.
[1321.40s -> 1323.40s]  Try the ink. Get poisoned.
[1323.40s -> 1325.40s]  If we can do this in time, you can make it
[1325.40s -> 1327.40s]  to the hospital. You want to up the stakes gamer?
[1329.40s -> 1331.40s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm
[1331.40s -> 1333.40s]  running to my destination.
[1333.40s -> 1335.40s]  What did you say?
[1335.40s -> 1337.40s]  When is some, seeing something familiar bomb become
[1337.40s -> 1339.40s]  comforting? No matter. This bomb will only be half comforting.
[1339.40s -> 1341.40s]  You ready to do this? Same thing.
[1341.40s -> 1343.40s]  Five minutes, three modules, three strikes.
[1343.40s -> 1345.40s]  I just spit on myself.
[1345.40s -> 1347.40s]  Alright. Are you going?
[1347.40s -> 1349.40s]  Alright. Yeah, I'm ready.
[1349.40s -> 1352.02s]  I'm ready.
[1352.02s -> 1354.02s]  Hang on, hang on. We're not done yet.
[1354.02s -> 1357.42s]  Alright, we're starting now.
[1357.42s -> 1359.42s]  Alright, gamer, you welcome? You welcome to
[1359.42s -> 1362.04s]  help? I'm ready.
[1362.04s -> 1364.04s]  Alright, first module is,
[1364.04s -> 1366.04s]  well, we actually have two wires now.
[1366.04s -> 1370.14s]  Why am I doing this so slow? Two wires?
[1370.14s -> 1372.14s]  What do you mean two wires? Okay, yeah. We're going to look at the first
[1372.14s -> 1374.14s]  one. It's going to be two yellow wires.
[1374.14s -> 1376.14s]  There's three wires in total. There's one red,
[1376.14s -> 1379.02s]  two yellow. Two yellow.
[1379.02s -> 1383.67s]  Okay.
[1383.67s -> 1385.67s]  As you said, there's a red wire. Thank you. I'm going.
[1385.67s -> 1387.67s]  Okay. Is the last wire white?
[1387.67s -> 1389.67s]  No, red. Last wire is what?
[1389.67s -> 1391.67s]  Is there, is there, is it, there's no more than one blue
[1391.67s -> 1393.67s]  wire? There's no,
[1393.67s -> 1395.67s]  there's three wires, two yellow,
[1395.67s -> 1397.67s]  one red. Cut the last wire.
[1397.67s -> 1400.86s]  Alright. Okay, what's the next one?
[1400.86s -> 1402.86s]  Second one, you have one
[1402.86s -> 1404.86s]  blue, one black, one red.
[1404.86s -> 1406.86s]  What do you mean, what do you mean? There's another, there's two wire modules?
[1406.86s -> 1408.86s]  There's two, there's, we just saw
[1408.86s -> 1410.86s]  one module of wires, now that's a whole
[1410.86s -> 1412.86s]  new salad of wires.
[1412.86s -> 1415.10s]  Fuck! Alright, what is it?
[1415.10s -> 1417.10s]  There's one blue, one black, one red. One blue,
[1417.10s -> 1424.20s]  one black, one red. What are you doing?
[1424.20s -> 1426.63s]  Cut the last wire again. You think you're funny? Cut the last wire again.
[1426.63s -> 1429.58s]  We got it.
[1429.58s -> 1431.58s]  Alright, and then we have a whole new problem.
[1431.58s -> 1433.58s]  Alright, listen.
[1433.58s -> 1435.58s]  Listen, we have a new problem now. We have a new model I've never seen
[1435.58s -> 1437.58s]  before. It's a giant two,
[1437.58s -> 1439.58s]  and it says one, three, two, four
[1439.58s -> 1441.58s]  in four different key buttons.

[2380.31s -> 2382.31s]  You know entertain you guys with with
[2382.63s -> 2386.75s]  Fail attempts we would essentially be beating this and there will be no comedy to it
[2386.87s -> 2392.19s]  So but we're gonna we're gonna do this thing now where we're gonna drop the facade and I know you guys are doing
[2392.19s -> 2394.63s]  Kappa and stuff like that, but but you could tell
[2395.75s -> 2398.38s]  That I'm not smiling when I'm saying this
[2398.78s -> 2401.27s]  That means that this this is the one

[3069.78s -> 3075.18s]  And they took a random one and I swear to God if we would have won that way fuck it, but here's the thing
[3076.18s -> 3080.18s]  I thought if you fail a module, that's it, right?

[3146.45s -> 3154.05s]  Immediately immediately tell me the number of like for wires number of wires immediately. Okay. All right. Okay four wires got it
[3154.85s -> 3156.85s]  Then go right. Okay. Okay
[3157.61s -> 3160.17s]  But then I can go bang right there

[3186.25s -> 3189.61s]  It does say you put you're playing half-life every single day on steam
[3190.09s -> 3194.07s]  Okay, at least on that that doesn't that okay just for clarification here
[3194.29s -> 3197.97s]  I've been playing half-life for like 35 days on steam and I don't know how to shut it down

[3249.70s -> 3254.58s]  Okay, I believe we can't do level two. This is fucking embarrassing. All right. Okay. Here we go. We've got three wires
[3255.62s -> 3257.62s]  Well, I didn't even know where we're going
[3258.02s -> 3259.66s]  Okay, three wires

[3269.44s -> 3271.49s]  Gotcha
[3271.49s -> 3277.66s]  Next we got a whole new problem. We got a whole new model. I'm not familiar unfamiliar with we have essentially pac-man
[3277.66s -> 3279.66s]  It looks like pac-man
[3282.42s -> 3286.22s]  Okay, all right. All right. All right. It's like a maze. Okay. Yeah
[3286.98s -> 3291.02s]  Okay, this is a find the maze with the matching circular markings
[3291.62s -> 3293.62s]  the diffuser must
[3293.62s -> 3295.62s]  Hold on the diffuser circles
[3295.82s -> 3302.10s]  The diffuser must navigate the white light to the red triangle using the arrow buttons warning. Oh fuck
[3302.10s -> 3304.10s]  I have you I have your keyboard disabled
[3304.62s -> 3309.00s]  German
[3309.00s -> 3317.06s]  Hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on. All right, I'll press the buttons. You just tell me what they are. Okay, but you not cross the lines
[3317.74s -> 3319.74s]  Do not cross the lines
[3319.74s -> 3323.98s]  In the maze. Okay, so I have no fucking idea what this wants us to do
[3324.74s -> 3330.06s]  This battle that battleship find the maze with the matching markings. Okay
[3330.90s -> 3333.42s]  All right. So where are the circles?
[3334.51s -> 3336.51s]  There's two circles at
[3336.63s -> 3341.47s]  The second row and the third row. Okay second. All right, are they on opposite ends?
[3342.43s -> 3345.23s]  Yes, they are. Okay, they're on opposite ends. So now
[3345.91s -> 3351.58s]  So that's the correct this one here, but what how am I so you have to navigate
[3352.42s -> 3358.50s]  You must navigate the white light to the red triangle. Where's the red triangle? It's
[3359.50s -> 3362.06s]  left of the the right third column
[3365.90s -> 3372.52s]  Okay, so so like one two three down and then one over from from the right. Sure
[3373.92s -> 3375.64s]  So now you have to
[3375.64s -> 3380.92s]  Navigate the white light to the red triangle. Don't cross the lines. These lines are invisible on the bond
[3381.76s -> 3383.60s]  We're fucked. We're fucked
[3383.60s -> 3395.43s]  You want to restart this? Wait, don't move. It's over Anakin. I have to hide rounds. I fucked it up
[3395.43s -> 3398.39s]  I fucked it up. You need to have you need to be able to press the keys
[3398.91s -> 3402.90s]  Just a bunch of buttons and explode and I'll give it to you. Okay
[3406.86s -> 3412.94s]  You don't need a key you use the mouse you can use the mouse what you can use the mouse to like navigate to the keys
[3412.94s -> 3414.94s]  You don't need a fucking numb
[3415.30s -> 3417.30s]  It says well, you have to use it
[3417.46s -> 3419.46s]  The keys, okay
[3420.54s -> 3424.74s]  It's not keys on the keyboard. It says the arrow buttons that the arrow

[3434.62s -> 3438.22s]  You must navigate the white light to the red triangle using the arrow buttons
[3438.22s -> 3443.98s]  You have to navigate to you have to navigate the white light to the red triangle. Don't cross the lines shown in the maze
[3444.22s -> 3449.38s]  These are invisible to the bomb. Okay, you let are you ready? Yeah, you want to go up?
[3450.94s -> 3454.28s]  Ops, not an option. What do you mean? No, it's what do you mean on an option?

[3469.14s -> 3480.92s]  Light the light you must navigate the white light to the red triangle. Tell them why the white dot is okay
[3480.92s -> 3482.92s]  it's at the bottom at
[3483.00s -> 3485.75s]  bottom at

[4535.98s -> 4537.98s]  Not to which for us means fucking impossible
[4538.94s -> 4543.02s]  I can't believe we spent that much time on the second fucking this level is the equivalent of like licking your elbow

[5207.92s -> 5209.76s]  You're looking right now
[5209.76s -> 5211.76s]  These things are fucking monstrous
[5212.64s -> 5214.66s]  Look at this shit
[5214.66s -> 5215.78s]  Yeah, but
[5215.78s -> 5219.70s]  Maybe there's kind of like normal sized and you know, the rest of you kind of you know
[5221.17s -> 5227.49s]  That was uh, that was joel that was playing. Uh, keep talking. I know what he exposed the joel. I have been apparently
[5227.57s -> 5230.61s]  He's gotta go. He's got something else going on today
[5231.25s -> 5233.25s]  So he's got something else to do
[5235.76s -> 5237.76s]  Uh, it was good playing with him
[5238.00s -> 5239.68s]  uh, it was
[5239.68s -> 5241.68s]  uh, it was uh
[5243.06s -> 5248.58s]  It was something and I look forward to the next time. Uh, we are trying to diffuse blow. Listen, we're gonna beat this game together
[5249.22s -> 5252.90s]  I don't matter no matter how no matter no matter how tough this is gonna get
[5253.62s -> 5255.78s]  So the power of of the mind
[5256.50s -> 5258.66s]  and with patience
[5258.66s -> 5260.66s]  I I thought we could get it done
[5261.70s -> 5266.26s]  We are getting it done. I'm just saying next time you're gonna realize when I read these instructions
[5267.14s -> 5269.01s]  that's
[5269.01s -> 5272.93s]  When you understand I feel like if I had the bomb in my hand and we flipped it around
[5273.94s -> 5275.78s]  It would be sad. I could probably get it
[5276.42s -> 5281.62s]  You could probably feed the info better and I could do the actual clicking and moving around better
[5282.02s -> 5284.02s]  We did it wrong. We should have been the other way
[5284.26s -> 5287.86s]  All right. All right. Well, we'll check back, uh next week
[5289.97s -> 5293.34s]  Saturday
[5293.34s -> 5296.22s]  And then uh, yeah, whatever you do for the rest of your stream. Have a good stream
[5297.02s -> 5299.02s]  All right. Well, uh, well i'll tell you what

[5318.53s -> 5323.73s]  kefabi kefabi kefabi mama de prosciutto listen, uh,
[5324.13s -> 5328.21s]  It's a term wrestlers use to like not break character and i'm gonna break characters
[5328.37s -> 5331.25s]  like mute the fucking stream or uh unmute it because uh,
[5331.73s -> 5334.53s]  it's been so terrible listen beside the point listen i'm saying that
[5335.09s -> 5336.83s]  German I

[5351.97s -> 5353.97s]  Uh
[5353.97s -> 5357.81s]  It was fun. It was a lot of fun. I know I I look forward to uh,
[5358.29s -> 5364.21s]  To more streams and uh, hopefully this stream was just a little bit better than halo reach. Uh, just a little like no
[5364.21s -> 5367.97s]  This was a thousand times better than halo reach like without a doubt in my mind
[5368.77s -> 5372.77s]  Yeah, but still still the worst of 2020 though, but no it was not. No it wasn't
[5374.93s -> 5380.93s]  No, what could someone be like through i've only streamed like three times in 2020. No twice this is the second time. Oh shit
[5382.61s -> 5386.29s]  Well, i'll tell you what i'll tell you what incompatible friends
[5388.21s -> 5390.77s]  What incompatible friends somebody just said
