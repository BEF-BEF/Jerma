[3.58s -> 10.34s]  Uh, somebody said, wouldn't it be funny if we could collectively all not chat during the beginning of the stream and freak them out?
[12.52s -> 14.58s]  You guys are coordinated.
[14.58s -> 16.42s]  You're not that coordinated.
[16.42s -> 20.14s]  It'd be impossible.
[20.14s -> 24.71s]  Somebody would take that opportunity to make sure that they were the only person in chat.
[26.04s -> 29.40s]  By the way, three thousand of them are gonna have that exact same idea.
[30.20s -> 34.49s]  It'll never happen.
[34.49s -> 39.00s]  Start to chant? What's to chant?
[39.00s -> 41.00s]  Oh, yeah, but it doesn't matter. Look.
[44.01s -> 46.73s]  Anyways, hi. Hope you- hi. What was that?
[48.28s -> 50.28s]  Anyways, hi. How are you? How's everybody doing?
[51.66s -> 55.02s]  Uh, today we're gonna do something I've been putting off for the last like three and a half weeks.
[56.41s -> 58.41s]  This was actually a stream I was gonna do
[58.97s -> 64.79s]  before the dollhouse stream, I believe. Or very very soon right after it.
[65.35s -> 67.35s]  But I didn't want to just be the Sims guy.
[68.57s -> 73.45s]  Oh, I did. I played the Sims before the dollhouse stream and here back after the dollhouse stream. Gonna play the Sims again.
[74.01s -> 76.18s]  Uh, so I figured I'd hold on to it for a little bit.
[77.30s -> 79.30s]  But uh, this is gonna be pretty interesting, I hope.
[79.70s -> 81.46s]  Last time we did this,
[81.46s -> 83.46s]  um, I may have given myself a hernia
[84.02s -> 86.30s]  in The Sims 4.
[86.30s -> 88.86s]  There's a specific point in time that I remember.
[89.50s -> 94.78s]  And that is laughing at a dog, uh, peeing in the house. The guy took a- the guy was on drugs.
[95.34s -> 97.42s]  Took his dog for a walk in his house.
[98.78s -> 101.50s]  Um, and that was the hardest I've ever laughed in my whole life.
[102.92s -> 106.36s]  I really think so. That was one of those times where I was laughing so hard
[107.16s -> 109.06s]  that
[109.06s -> 113.94s]  like the world collapses around you and you want to get out so bad. You want to pull the plug so bad,
[113.94s -> 115.51s]  but you can't.
[115.51s -> 118.55s]  You know what I'm talking about? Sure, you guys have heard me laugh on this channel, like
[122.15s -> 125.02s]  I have control there.
[125.02s -> 128.14s]  When you get into one of those laughing fits where you're out of control
[128.86s -> 131.10s]  and you're not in- you're not in control of your own body at all.
[132.18s -> 136.98s]  Like laughing is just like, please, I want it to stop. I would like for this to stop, please.
[137.46s -> 139.46s]  But it doesn't. It- nothing helps it.
[139.80s -> 143.32s]  Um, that happened during the guy walks his dog in his house routine.
[144.20s -> 148.28s]  Uh, it may have given me a hernia. So, hernia part two incoming maybe.
[149.08s -> 152.36s]  I don't- that's not confirmed by the way. I don't know if that really happened. I'm just saying it is.
[154.92s -> 157.40s]  Um, but this is Sims 3, not The Sims 4.
[158.68s -> 162.68s]  Hey, thank you. Why, honey, for the 10 communities up? Oh, I didn't even tweet. What the fuck?
[164.36s -> 166.36s]  Oh, yeah, I did. No, I didn't. I didn't press the button.
[169.34s -> 174.58s]  There we go. But, uh, this one's a little different because
[176.86s -> 178.62s]  this one has a mod.
[178.62s -> 180.62s]  I don't know how this is gonna work out.
[180.94s -> 184.47s]  But I guess- should I even spoil it? I don't know.
[186.23s -> 192.15s]  Oh, like the world can end. If I just start playing and all of a sudden the world ends, that's gonna be kind of
[192.79s -> 194.15s]  a waste of time.
[194.15s -> 207.78s]  Oh, I don't have any sex mods. Spoilers, dude. Why hasn't it even happened yet?
[208.42s -> 216.15s]  Why would you want?
[216.15s -> 219.99s]  Losing viewers. I just started the stream. You know, no one's gonna just leave because there's no
[221.51s -> 226.71s]  woohoo mod.
[226.71s -> 229.75s]  Hey, crush lizard. Thanks for 20 community subs. Holy shit.
[230.39s -> 233.08s]  Thank you. That's a lot. Thank you.
[238.42s -> 240.42s]  Download them. No.
[245.72s -> 249.24s]  I also, uh, got on this one, which is-
[249.96s -> 255.96s]  I may have overdone it a little bit. I got that, um, like total complete control mod that's on the sims 3.
[256.68s -> 260.20s]  You can edit the actual creative sim file thing
[261.32s -> 264.04s]  and change the body sliders to be like times 5000.
[264.76s -> 267.80s]  I- it's- that's active right now. It may be too much.
[268.60s -> 270.60s]  And you'll see why in about 30 seconds.
[270.76s -> 273.88s]  But I'm just- I'm just waiting. I'm waiting for people to trickle in.
[277.08s -> 279.64s]  It's so much that it's- it's not even funny.
[280.63s -> 282.79s]  You can do it so far that the person turns into,
[283.67s -> 285.30s]  um,
[285.30s -> 288.18s]  I don't even know. They turn to like their own like solar system.
[292.82s -> 294.82s]  Not the slider mods.
[295.14s -> 300.55s]  What about the drugs mod? There is no drugs mod for sims 3.
[301.66s -> 304.14s]  I don't- at least not one that you can actually use.
[304.94s -> 307.58s]  I think there's drug paraphernalia you can put in.
[308.73s -> 309.86s]  But-
[309.86s -> 314.42s]  And by the way, I haven't really tested these. I did- I tested all of them like three and a half weeks ago.
[315.30s -> 319.06s]  But I don't know. I'm gonna be very surprised by you guys because I just put a shit load of stuff in here.
[319.06s -> 320.66s]  I don't even remember what's in here.
[320.66s -> 324.57s]  I- I mean, it's- I don't know what's gonna happen. I forget what's in here.
[324.57s -> 327.53s]  Hopefully I didn't add like a sex mod like as a joke for myself.
[329.34s -> 331.34s]  Okay, hold on.
[331.58s -> 334.86s]  Let's- let's like- let's go back here because
[335.66s -> 337.66s]  It's a joke.
[340.23s -> 343.27s]  All right, you know what I meant by that though? Like, oh just-
[346.04s -> 350.52s]  I definitely didn't. I'm certain of that because it pops up at the beginning that says every- all the scripts that are installed.
[352.78s -> 356.62s]  And it's like, oh you don't- you've got like this, this, this, this, this. None of them were on there. Don't worry.
[356.94s -> 358.94s]  Oh, it was just- it was just for a joke.
[359.42s -> 364.47s]  All right, here we go.
[364.47s -> 367.42s]  I think there's enough people here. We can just kind of go for it.
[370.38s -> 373.34s]  And...
[373.34s -> 374.78s]  And...
[374.78s -> 376.70s]  Hello?
[376.70s -> 384.84s]  Hello? Oh, there it is. All right, so, uh,
[385.16s -> 387.16s]  Let's just, very, very quickly,
[388.14s -> 392.14s]  I just got in to make sure we were ready because it takes- when you have mods, it takes a long time to load the game.
[393.27s -> 398.31s]  Where's the music? I've been in the menu for too long. Uh, let's just go ahead and show you what can happen here if I do this.
[400.25s -> 402.74s]  Oh! Oh!
[404.87s -> 410.15s]  To the point where it doesn't- it doesn't make any sense. They turn into- they turn into like an N64 polygon.
[410.55s -> 421.48s]  You can make it huge. But look at- look at how far these bars go. I may- I- I over did it a lot.
[421.80s -> 428.20s]  Somebody just gave a shitload of subs and it immediately got removed. What was it?
[430.06s -> 433.02s]  Autumn just gave five subs. So somebody just gave a shitload. Who just gave that?
[433.58s -> 439.37s]  All right, so we have to- I gotta figure out what I want to do here. What do I want to do?
[439.85s -> 448.63s]  Oh, it's nuclear waffle. Okay, 50 subs. Holy shit, nuclear waffle. Jesus.
[450.82s -> 453.46s]  Okay, one thing that's important, too, is I know- look,
[454.50s -> 456.66s]  people are gonna think this is really funny, and I do, too.
[457.98s -> 459.58s]  Uh, take a look at this.
[459.58s -> 466.73s]  This is a baby. You can- it's pretty much- you can do anything.
[469.91s -> 472.55s]  It's- it's too extreme, but we can make a weird baby.
[473.67s -> 491.74s]  I kind of want like a huge chin baby. You- it can go as far down or- oh my god. My god, I already like it.
[497.26s -> 501.88s]  Under-
[501.88s -> 510.09s]  It's turning into the scream face. All right. No, okay. I'm gonna make somebody- I'm gonna make somebody a urinal.
[510.33s -> 513.05s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Everybody relax. I'm gonna make a urinal.
[513.53s -> 519.06s]  It's gonna- the name's gonna be like Bob Urinal. Okay, not the- it's not the baby, though. I'm gonna make a urinal.
[522.44s -> 526.79s]  Go back. It's basics.
[527.43s -> 535.21s]  Okay, this guy's name is gonna be like, uh, I don't know, urinal. I'll work on- look, I gotta do this one at a time.
[535.77s -> 537.53s]  I don't even know what family this is.
[537.53s -> 546.94s]  I gotta change this a little bit. It needs to be a urinal.
[549.86s -> 556.58s]  Let's start- the mu- there's no music. This makes this way creepier than it has to be. It's probably wider than that, right?
[556.82s -> 564.68s]  That looks all right. I need a family name.
[565.08s -> 568.87s]  What about music? I was in the menu for too long, that's why.
[571.06s -> 574.10s]  The head needs to be- this has to be lower, and this has to be longer.
[575.66s -> 581.27s]  And actually, this needs to be wider, too. Hold on. Not that wide.
[581.59s -> 599.13s]  That's way too much. That's pretty good. A little bit more. Make this guy's name urine Earl.
[599.61s -> 606.63s]  I put his head- now this part of his face has to be a little wider, too.
[607.96s -> 616.04s]  Like that. All right, does anybody else- does anybody else hope that, like, fucking
[616.68s -> 625.32s]  Gary Urinal dies first?
[625.32s -> 631.77s]  Urine Earl. Now, that's to be in, like that. Okay, that's better.
[633.46s -> 636.66s]  This needs to be way wa- way taller. Hold on. Cheek. Face height. Here we go.
[636.98s -> 645.93s]  Holy shit. Oh, oh, I don't like this.
[646.49s -> 657.02s]  I hate this. It looks like it's Quagmire.
[662.23s -> 667.96s]  Are urinals anon- yeah, that's okay. It's not Quagmire. I'll fix it. What about his ears?
[668.84s -> 674.94s]  What the fuck? Ears orbit? Oh, they can spin around. Ears point?
[677.37s -> 689.42s]  I'm just making an orc.
[689.42s -> 697.06s]  Okay, I kind of like it. I don't hate it. Oh, what's his name? From Jack and Dexter.
[697.86s -> 701.54s]  No, from Ratchet and Clank. What's his name? Do you know the one I'm talking about? What's his name?
[701.54s -> 711.61s]  What's his name? Which one is it? It's one of them. No, not Baby Yoda. What- Ratchet. Yeah, there it is.
[711.85s -> 723.74s]  This is Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank. Ratchet urinal. I like it. I need to like look up- oh my god.
[723.74s -> 735.13s]  Do I have this wrong? Ratchet and Clank. And Clank. This is what I'm thinking of, right? Yes, it is.
[735.13s -> 743.54s]  Of course it is. That's Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank. What about the- hold on. The eyes.
[744.57s -> 753.34s]  Eyebrows. I like that. I need- I need some- I need the music back. This feels weird that you're
[753.34s -> 767.99s]  watching me do this without the music. The music makes this fine. How about right there? What is it?
[767.99s -> 785.82s]  Orc. It's a chihuahua? It's not a chihuahua. Oh, I like the flat. Yeah. It looks like the eagle
[785.82s -> 793.35s]  for the buffets that doesn't take shit from anybody. All right. Nose bridge. I don't- what
[793.35s -> 803.50s]  is that even- what is that even doing? Bridge height? Oh, that just like carves a space in his
[803.50s -> 817.67s]  eyebrows. I actually kind of like that. Wait, I need the music right now. Music. All right, let's go.
[818.23s -> 841.37s]  Where is it? That's way- that's way too loud. I like it. I put it on. See? No, it's not weird
[841.37s -> 846.17s]  anymore. You understand? Before it was a creepy weird guy making like creations in his fucking
[846.17s -> 852.01s]  basement. Now this is like a fun family fun thing we're doing. This is now not weird anymore. This
[852.01s -> 862.42s]  is funny and interesting. Look, like- I like that. Can they even talk? This is too loud though.
[862.42s -> 877.98s]  Is this even a song that I picked? The nose is never gonna be- god, no. What does Ratchet's
[877.98s -> 887.61s]  nose look like? Let me see. What does Ratchet's face look like? All right, it's kind of like down
[887.61s -> 903.13s]  and it's- it's- it's forward. It's like down here. It's like a little point that goes down kind of
[903.13s -> 917.40s]  below. Kind of like a height. I'll have to hear that. Nose scale. No, it's gotta be nose height.
[918.36s -> 926.82s]  Nose area. I mean, that does not- that does not- that does not look like Ratchet. It's too big.
[927.70s -> 940.41s]  What does this face look- oh, it's got big eyes. It's the eyes. Okay, here we go. All- all alien
[940.41s -> 958.90s]  eyes? Eye scale. There it is. Oh, this feels like one of those- oh no. Okay, here we go.
[958.90s -> 975.99s]  You forgot to- what? What did I forget to do? How high are his eyes? Looks like a furby? It does
[975.99s -> 988.90s]  look like a furby. Okay, his mouth is a little bigger. All right, well, if he's a fur- all right,
[988.90s -> 994.65s]  this is just a test. That is- I haven't really played with these that much. Mouth corner depth.
[994.65s -> 1003.77s]  Hold on. This is the guy from Family Guy. The guy like this. I'm gonna change that though. It's
[1003.77s -> 1032.74s]  not the same guy. Oh, I gotta like this. It's Grumpy Cat. I don't want it to be- oh look,
[1032.74s -> 1041.66s]  we can't go too ridiculous, but we- we can't see them. Like, that's ridiculous. This is- this is
[1041.66s -> 1056.22s]  like not as ridiculous. I'm gonna say like right here. The- the bottom lip has to come in. Make
[1056.22s -> 1060.06s]  Stewie. No! All right, fine. That's actually kind of funny. I'll make- I'll make Stewie.
[1066.66s -> 1070.42s]  I need to drop something here because I- look, I don't want all the artifacting.
[1073.85s -> 1087.54s]  Yeah, the bottom lip has to come in because it's way too high. How about like this? No, I- it's all
[1087.54s -> 1091.94s]  fucked up somewhere. I don't know where. Where is it- where am I getting like the double bottom chin
[1091.94s -> 1100.78s]  thing? The hair is gonna be interesting. Oh, I thought this was- I was about to sing the song.
[1100.78s -> 1107.40s]  It's not- it's not the song. Okay, let's just- let me- I'm- I'm done with this one. This is a test.
[1108.04s -> 1125.32s]  I don't want it to be- okay, that's fine. This is episode of the Twilight Zone.
[1127.22s -> 1130.18s]  No, I'm not randomized. All right, who- what- what is this- what's his family?
[1131.06s -> 1144.01s]  What's his family? I'm not making the Griffin family.
[1147.46s -> 1162.74s]  The human- he's human? All right, what was- it was not the Albertsons. This music is fucking loud,
[1162.74s -> 1178.14s]  man. Hold on. I know I wanted it, but seriously. Jesus. That's better. Oh, that's- no, that's way
[1178.14s -> 1194.07s]  too low. Okay, that's good. Uh, how about- I mean, this is Ratchet Urinal. Um, what- that's- who
[1194.07s -> 1217.66s]  cares? It's just Ratchet. Ratchet Urinal. So the- no, the last name's not gonna be Urinal. The last
[1217.66s -> 1224.26s]  name can't be Urinal. That's- is that that funny? You guys- that's that funny to you guys? Is that
[1224.26s -> 1244.62s]  the- their last name is the Urinal family? No, it's not. It's not. Flush family. That- to me,
[1244.62s -> 1256.38s]  that's funnier than Urinal. How about Ratchet Flush? Guys, these- don't worry. They're all
[1256.38s -> 1260.46s]  dead in less than 40 minutes, so don't worry. This- we're gonna do this again. Who cares about
[1260.46s -> 1276.65s]  the Flush family? Nobody. We're gonna do it again. I'm gonna- okay. I need to do clothes. Hair and
[1276.65s -> 1289.82s]  clothes. All right, let me take the hat off. By the way, I have every- almost every single expansion
[1289.82s -> 1317.30s]  thing in the game. I want to take the hat off. Oh, good lord. Um, hold on. Wait, I just want hair.
[1317.30s -> 1329.18s]  Take the hat off. How do I take off the hat? Hair. Why is this the- why is this the only hair I have
[1334.23s -> 1345.99s]  right next to it? Hair with accessories. Tabs? Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. How do I get this off?
[1347.46s -> 1354.62s]  Am I insane? How do I just remove the hat? To the left?
[1357.58s -> 1375.61s]  How do you take hats off? Click it twice. You don't take the hat off. Is it just a re- just take- oh,
[1375.61s -> 1387.69s]  wait, this is just hair? So just leave that. Why can't I just take the hat off? All right, well,
[1387.69s -> 1397.69s]  whatever. The left hair tab is normal. Hair with accept- oh, okay, I thought this was hats, not like
[1397.69s -> 1417.02s]  hair and hats. I hate all of these. I don't want any of these. This is so messy. Hold on, we need,
[1417.02s -> 1426.94s]  like, what does Ratchet have for, like, hair? It's like orange, right? Like, yellow, orange?
[1427.74s -> 1456.26s]  Technically, it would just be bald. He's got a hat on? He does? Oh, he does have a hat. It's
[1456.26s -> 1461.85s]  the guy- it's the dog from Spaceballs. Barf is what you're talking about, and yes, it is.
[1462.49s -> 1469.45s]  Let me see if they have, like, a little thing like that. Uh, do they have something like that?
[1469.45s -> 1491.53s]  Does it really matter? This? Does this work? No. No, we're just going with the hair.
[1492.41s -> 1499.75s]  It does look more like a Furby than Ratchet, you're right, but it doesn't matter.
[1500.47s -> 1516.90s]  Okay, any of these are fine. This one's fine. Make it the- make the cast of Spaceballs. No.
[1517.62s -> 1523.67s]  Okay, that's fine. Eyebrow, uh, is- I mean, you can't even see them. They don't really matter.
[1523.67s -> 1529.67s]  What about a beard? This is not going to make any sense, considering where it is. Although,
[1529.67s -> 1549.86s]  it kind of does. I don't look like George Lucas in, like, the 70s. No, no facial hair.
[1550.66s -> 1569.06s]  All right, good. Cool. Now, what- what about clothes? No clothes? I'm gonna- I mean,
[1569.06s -> 1576.15s]  I have to put clothes on. Oh! Is it, like, an unpopular opinion for me to say I don't care
[1576.15s -> 1582.81s]  about any of the clothing in The Sims? Like, is that- I mean, is that kind of bad for me to say?
[1584.86s -> 1588.14s]  Every single Sim I've ever made could just wear a white t-shirt and that's it and I don't even care.
[1588.86s -> 1599.03s]  I, like, never cared about the clothes. Is there, like, just an option where you can randomize their
[1599.03s -> 1612.42s]  clothes? Actually, let's do- the guy with the rose? All right, rose. This is just every day.
[1612.98s -> 1616.70s]  Like, everybody's going to spin around and wear the same pajamas. Who cares?
[1617.34s -> 1625.42s]  Normal. Look, it's going to be just a normal- normal, right? Just- yeah. Yeah, that's- that's- um,
[1626.06s -> 1637.30s]  what just happened? Normal? Okay, um, what is it? Sleepwear? Prunar Dar. Yeah.
[1637.78s -> 1656.15s]  Oh, Jesus. Okay. This is athletic. This is swimwear. Yeah, whatever. Every day, you can just be the
[1656.15s -> 1663.91s]  guy- be the guy wearing these clothes. Oh, he should've- This dude, absolutely without a doubt
[1663.91s -> 1671.74s]  in my mind, carries a pocket watch in his pocket and makes a real clear, clear view for everybody
[1671.74s -> 1677.88s]  to see that they're taking it out and looking at it all the time. All right, uh, I don't even
[1677.88s -> 1687.02s]  know what this person's name was. All right, personality. Uh, couch potato, that's fine.
[1687.02s -> 1698.90s]  Heavy sleeper, that's fine. Uh, traits. Clumsy, that's fine. Is that not- oh, I didn't put it on.
[1698.90s -> 1703.45s]  All right, how about, uh, mental? Let's see. Bookworm, can't- I thought this said can't- no.
[1704.17s -> 1713.32s]  Computer whiz. I don't- why is- what's my brain doing? I thought this said exotic. I was like,
[1713.32s -> 1729.08s]  what do- what? Excitable. I'm like- I'm like combining words. When words are this close
[1729.08s -> 1734.68s]  to each other, and anybody else get this problem, when words are this close and this small font,
[1734.68s -> 1744.52s]  they can kind of like- I read it like the other way. Is that weird? Unstable for sure.
[1749.67s -> 1757.66s]  Afraid of water? Terrified of swimming. All right, definitely charismatic.
[1761.05s -> 1762.33s]  And I would say dramatic.
[1764.89s -> 1770.47s]  Aren't you gonna look good? Uh, super popular, doesn't matter. A meteor is gonna probably hit
[1770.47s -> 1777.80s]  the house, so it doesn't really matter what they- what his aspirations are. Favorite food? Dim sum.
[1777.80s -> 1785.12s]  Okay. Favorite music? Roots. Favorite color? Red. Okay. Let's do a voice-
[1785.12s -> 1794.71s]  Zondelma- Chabo- Meeyapso. Chabo- Zondelma- Meeyapso. Simchiwani-do.
[1794.71s -> 1806.60s]  Astrological sign? Uh, Sagittarius. That looks good. Okay. That's, uh- oh yeah, the name was
[1806.68s -> 1814.34s]  Flushes. Okay. Uh, let's do another one. Add sim- or pet. Oh please. Oh god. Wait, create dog,
[1814.34s -> 1817.94s]  create a horse. We can have a horse in the house. We can have a horse in the house. I just want
[1817.94s -> 1834.49s]  everyone to be aware of that. Okay, here we go. Pre-Nufa. Okay, let's go- Suzzle. How about just
[1834.49s -> 1848.20s]  like, somebody that's way too jacked? This just reminds me of- that's huge. How am I gonna make
[1848.20s -> 1861.78s]  me? Let's just be so defined. I want to be like the people of those competitions where they don't-
[1861.78s -> 1868.78s]  they don't look human. They're covered in like- in like oil. Like they were sculpted out of clay
[1868.78s -> 1879.72s]  or something or out of like Play-Doh. Here, I'll- look, look, look, look, look. Now it makes sense.
[1879.72s -> 1897.19s]  I want to see- I want to see him without a shirt on. So bad. Let's not go too ridiculous. Just
[1897.19s -> 1913.42s]  ridiculous enough where it's funny. This is uncanny. Mr. Satan. Well, not yet. I gotta make me. I gotta
[1913.42s -> 1920.15s]  be in this house. Uh, what did 2012 Derma hair look like? I don't remember. It was kind of short,
[1920.15s -> 1936.14s]  right? It was like this? No, like this? I feel like it was kind of like that. It was shorter though.
[1936.14s -> 1952.97s]  That's kind of close. Spiked at the front and shaved on the sides. I don't know if they have
[1952.97s -> 1971.45s]  a hairstyle like that. I mean, not like this. It would be- I passed it? I didn't- that's not
[1971.45s -> 1984.33s]  the haircut I had in 2012. I'm just gonna pick this one. This one or this one. It was something
[1984.33s -> 1993.64s]  like- yeah, it was like this. Looks good. Okay. Eyebrows. I have pretty thick eyebrows.
[1994.52s -> 1998.20s]  I gotta- this is pretty much what my beard looks like, although I didn't really have that.
[2000.38s -> 2013.54s]  Body hair. Okay, here we go. This is important. So I'm just gonna be the only like normal looking
[2013.54s -> 2028.14s]  person in the house. It's just- it's not even close. This is just Randy Orton. Forget it.
[2028.14s -> 2042.68s]  This is Randy Orton. This is not even me. I'm changing it to Randy Orton. It's normal. Should I
[2042.68s -> 2057.66s]  just- no, make it Jerma. Stick to Jerma. Look at the mirror, right? Okay. Put the music back on. I
[2057.66s -> 2070.42s]  hate that it's not doing this without the music. It's weird without the music. It's- no, where's
[2070.42s -> 2075.30s]  my music? I was gonna say it's weird without music, but it's weirder with like classical music.
[2075.30s -> 2095.61s]  Put this one on. Oh, create a sim. Here we go. I think this is just- I can't like delete these.
[2097.05s -> 2104.87s]  Oh, whatever. Who cares? All right, let's do- how wide can I make somebody's head
[2104.87s -> 2129.98s]  without it destroying everything? All right, hold on. Put it back. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[2129.98s -> 2151.82s]  What's going on with the forehead? What's this eye? I'm trying- I- it's the eyebrow, I think,
[2151.82s -> 2163.02s]  is coming down too far. I'm trying to get the eyes to be open. No, it's do- it's impossible.
[2163.66s -> 2183.56s]  Shit. I gotta go back. How do I go back? How do I go back? How do I- is it control Z? I can go a
[2183.56s -> 2196.44s]  little wider than that. At least I think so. Is this like a- isn't this like a meme image?
[2197.16s -> 2223.75s]  No, don't go too wild here. I don't want it to be too outrageous. I want to use the- I want to
[2223.75s -> 2242.87s]  be able to see his face. What does this look like? This looks like somebody. Okay, jaw depth.
[2243.77s -> 2253.90s]  No, no, no. By the way, I- I promise I will make at least one like exploding person, but it can't
[2253.90s -> 2283.34s]  be everybody. Remove the hair. It's Joe Rogan. No, it's not. Oh, that's facial hair. Oh, I mean,
[2283.34s -> 2300.74s]  no, it's not really. Well, we gotta put hair. It's the- it's the- it's from a claymation movie.
[2304.38s -> 2307.82s]  What the fuck is the name of that movie? It's from a- like a stop motion movie.
[2308.98s -> 2321.19s]  No, no, no, no. That Tim Burton movie? ParaNorman, that's the one. Yep, it's the- it's
[2321.19s -> 2331.03s]  one of the- it's one of the guys from ParaNorman. It needs to be a little thinner in the head,
[2331.03s -> 2336.25s]  but it's one of the- it's like the guy with the big long head, and he's a big,
[2336.25s -> 2345.74s]  tough guy or something. I never saw the movie. Kind of like this, and that's what's gonna stay.
[2346.62s -> 2368.54s]  I'm rooting for this character, by the way. I want this character to make it.
[2369.34s -> 2400.14s]  All right, we're not done with the face. Shit. Okay, I like it. Looks good. Not extreme jowls,
[2400.14s -> 2415.30s]  no thank you. This is barbecue football dad. You mean dad- the dad always manning the grill
[2415.30s -> 2423.90s]  at every family get together? Oh, I'll do you one up. Dad that always at dinner?
[2424.70s -> 2429.02s]  Always? No matter what they're eating, it could be- you could be at like Chili's or like a five
[2429.02s -> 2435.98s]  star restaurant. They eat something that they like? Oh, that's- oh, that's unfair. Oh, that's unfair.
[2435.98s -> 2443.35s]  That's unfair. Oh, this should be illegal. Like, you like it, I guess. Oh man, this shot- this shot,
[2443.35s -> 2455.42s]  that's unfair. Dad, you've had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's like 40 times. They're good.
[2457.14s -> 2466.97s]  Really good. All right, let's keep going. Looks like Henry the 8th?
[2470.39s -> 2480.76s]  I want to see. I want to see what Henry the 8th looks like. Oh, that's also the same dad who
[2481.80s -> 2487.74s]  every time you go on vacation and they really like where they are, they'll point at residential
[2487.74s -> 2495.24s]  areas around the place where you are a tourist. Oh man, imagine that in your backyard. Oh shit,
[2495.24s -> 2499.77s]  imagine having this in your backyard. Oh man, imagine having that in your back- right in your
[2499.77s -> 2510.71s]  backyard. Yeah, the Eiffel Tower is there and then people live over there. Oh, it's beautiful. Imagine
[2510.71s -> 2527.59s]  having this in your backyard. Yeah, hey dad, now you're reaching. No, it's true. All right, I want
[2527.59s -> 2535.75s]  to live this alone. I think he's perfect. How much that house over there cost? Yeah, they always want
[2535.75s -> 2544.23s]  to know how much the real estate is and it's either way too much or way too little. Just imagine
[2544.23s -> 2548.63s]  paying fucking 600 grand for that house. Stupid. These people are fucking idiots. These people are
[2548.63s -> 2555.64s]  idiots. What? 110,000 for that house? Oh my fucking god, they have it easy here. So easy. It's so
[2555.64s -> 2586.04s]  simple for you guys here. Like, do I- do we make a cyclops? No, no, no. It was perfect where it was.
[2586.04s -> 2604.33s]  Leave it. Oh, that's- dad when he sees self-washed egg rolls? Whoa, meme image. Dad when I get
[2604.97s -> 2612.20s]  straight A's on fucking my last test? Oh, dad when it's 50% off southwestern egg rolls night?
[2612.84s -> 2628.17s]  All right, I gotta calm down. I'm too- I'm too energetic right now. Okay, it looks good. It
[2628.17s -> 2631.45s]  looks good. I think everything's perfect. I don't want to do anything else. Maybe a little bit on
[2631.45s -> 2641.90s]  the mouth. Just a little. Not that much. Don't- oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Actually, it actually kind
[2641.90s -> 2671.99s]  of works. This person's wearing somebody else's skin. No, it's perfect right there. Everything's
[2671.99s -> 2675.58s]  perfect. I don't- don't touch anything. It's over. All right, what's the- who's this person?
[2681.03s -> 2693.14s]  I feel- I'm starting to feel like a song coming on. I feel pretty good. Never mind, it's the wrong
[2693.14s -> 2708.82s]  song. All right, every day, let's just put on every day. Now it is Henry VIII. I kind of want to keep
[2708.82s -> 2723.56s]  it. All right, those legs though. Yeah, I know. I want to see swimwear because I want to see how
[2723.56s -> 2745.78s]  huge he is. What? Why are you in a wetsuit? Um, wetsuit? I want him to be in like a bathing suit.
[2746.42s -> 2759.66s]  Make the sus guy- I will. I will. They're dead first though. It's under bottoms. Oh, outfits,
[2759.66s -> 2777.90s]  I see, okay. Jesus. He's got a really small ass. You understand- do you see that? That seems- that's
[2777.98s -> 2785.98s]  weird. Why is his ass so small? And the connecting part to his ass, to his legs, is enormous.
[2791.22s -> 2804.90s]  Okay, that looks good. Let's have the bottoms of the- that's good. Accessories, something like
[2804.90s -> 2811.13s]  bare- yeah, bare goggles. They don't fit his head. That's perfect. Oh, what? Maybe we should put
[2811.13s -> 2834.44s]  glasses on to go swimming? What is that? What is that? What is it? Gills? All right, I like that.
[2834.44s -> 2842.62s]  That looks good. Uh, outerwear, like winter time. Okay, I can- it can be- this is fine.
[2843.26s -> 2853.11s]  Actually, hold on. I want- what about like a- like one of these? That's what he has on right now.
[2853.75s -> 2870.41s]  Okay. Final Fantasy VII, dad. Oh, just wait. We'll make Final Fantasy VII, dad. This is an actual
[2870.41s -> 2888.71s]  Nickelodeon character? Who? Oh wait, it is! It's Arty! Strongest man in the world. But he actually
[2888.71s -> 2898.81s]  is huge. Okay, we need some info. This is no longer this person. Oh man, I have no idea.
[2899.61s -> 2907.03s]  I don't- I have no idea what this person's name is. This- we- this person was four different people.
[2910.14s -> 2922.81s]  Henry, the eighth strongest man in the world? Would- Henry, the eighth strongest dad in the
[2922.81s -> 2955.42s]  world? Henry Flush. I mean, Henry's fine. How about Strong Henry? Strong Henry Flush. Henry the last.
[2956.06s -> 2965.30s]  All right, looks good. I like the- okay, all right, let's keep going.
[2966.02s -> 2972.28s]  We're gonna add- we're gonna make the sus guy. And you bet your ass that within five seconds
[2972.28s -> 2985.27s]  of loading into the game, I am- um, I'm gonna literally just like blow him up. Okay, there comes
[2985.27s -> 3000.79s]  the sus guy. Sus Flush. Oh man, I had one of those yesterday. What does that even mean? In the moment,
[3000.79s -> 3004.95s]  that sounded like a decent thing to say. I don't even know what that means. You had a sus flush,
[3004.95s -> 3008.71s]  which means like you had diarrhea. I don't even know. I don't- that just kind of came out of no-
[3008.71s -> 3019.40s]  I don't know what I meant to- what I meant by that one. I filled the bowl so it didn't go down.
[3022.01s -> 3032.71s]  Sussy Flushy. All right, here you go, sus. Let's make- let's make the sus guy an adult, as he is.
[3038.60s -> 3041.96s]  Yeah, this really kind of goes down to whatever- what we can do with the face here.
[3041.96s -> 3053.03s]  All right, let's take the hair off. Sus hair was, um, it was really all over the place, right? It
[3053.03s -> 3065.78s]  kind of looked like that. Like that. That's pretty close. I need to- okay, I know what it looks like.
[3066.42s -> 3083.05s]  Go with mouth. Mouth corners, rotate this. Mouth curve, like that. Mouth definition, mouth depth.
[3083.61s -> 3099.78s]  Just wait, don't worry. Uh, didn't really work the way that I wanted it to. I'll- I'll get it to work.
[3103.78s -> 3126.89s]  I don't think I can make his teeth bigger. It just looks like a duck. Get a reference pick. Yeah,
[3126.89s -> 3134.47s]  I got one. I just don't- I can't make the teeth bigger. The reference image up here. Uh, yeah,
[3134.47s -> 3142.66s]  I will. Uh, what do I just type into Google? Sus guy. That should pop up, right? There it is.
[3145.48s -> 3169.58s]  Jesus. Uh, sus guy. Derma sus. Okay. Where'd it go?
[3175.16s -> 3185.54s]  I- I still look at this and I just get- I'm just like, what the fuck? You know what I mean?
[3196.74s -> 3199.06s]  It's the eyes. The eyes are gonna be really fucked up, too. Okay.
[3199.70s -> 3206.33s]  I just have to- All right. This is, uh, the chin needs to come down a lot.
[3209.37s -> 3227.40s]  Face height. Chin has to come down. Not that. It's only like this.
[3228.20s -> 3247.62s]  Jaw has to come in a little. Looks good. I hate this image. No, I had it right. Right there. Okay.
[3247.62s -> 3253.96s]  Chin under lip depth. Oh, right. This is like- Okay. No, no, no, no. I don't want to screw this up.
[3254.60s -> 3277.27s]  Like that. The jaw is- Turn off the cam. I need it as a reference. Oh, God.
[3277.27s -> 3283.32s]  It's a Bob's Burgers character. Did I make the Bob's Burgers sus guy?
[3290.62s -> 3302.34s]  Forward's too far. It's like right there. How far is it? Okay. From the nose to the mouth is pretty
[3302.34s -> 3323.29s]  short. Just gotta open that mouth. Uh, nose is too small. I know. I'm working on it. I think
[3324.01s -> 3331.34s]  when he talks, he'll open his mouth, right? Cheekbone height. Stay down like this. Cheekbone shape.
[3332.22s -> 3347.35s]  Pull it out a little bit. Looks fine. Fine. It's fine. Ears are fine.
[3348.31s -> 3354.04s]  All right. Eyes. Eye depth. They're probably to be coming out a little bit.
[3354.92s -> 3384.89s]  Eye distance. They're tilted a little bit too. Tilt at the corners. All right. How- Where are
[3384.89s -> 3392.14s]  they rotated? Like this, right? Just a little. Attack on Titan. How is this Attack on Titan?
[3398.15s -> 3403.64s]  Oh, my God. All right. It's coming together. Oh, you know, I think I might feel a song coming up.
[3404.04s -> 3424.66s]  What will I do? All right. I need to open the mouth, but I can't right now.
[3428.30s -> 3435.66s]  Sing it. I can't. No, I can't. I- What will I do? Choices, they're true. I'm not sure,
[3435.66s -> 3442.46s]  but I want someone to really think up. Maybe I'll build a house. Maybe I'll make some food.
[3442.46s -> 3449.75s]  I don't know, but it's time to begin the Sims. I think that video is one of the least viewed
[3449.75s -> 3457.08s]  videos of the grandpa series on my channel on my 2013. All right. The nose has to be bigger.
[3457.72s -> 3491.67s]  It's fine. Okay. Now we got to go here. It's a little bit- It's down. It is down. Not that far.
[3492.39s -> 3530.06s]  A little wider. Okay. It's not that far. Okay. Right like there. Change the hair. Yeah, I will.
[3530.06s -> 3556.73s]  I got to get the mouth right though. All right. Come on. How do I do this? It'll work when he
[3556.73s -> 3569.59s]  talks. Skin mustache. Yeah, it'll work when he talks. So this doesn't need to be that high,
[3569.59s -> 3574.42s]  though. All right. Yeah. That looked- That looked way too ridiculous. Let's put this down.
[3575.14s -> 3590.92s]  I feel like I have like weird like flesh wings on like a skin mustache. It is. Oh my god. That's
[3590.92s -> 3604.39s]  so fucked up looking. It's a- There's a skin mustache. I don't know how to get rid of that.
[3604.39s -> 3618.26s]  All right. We're going to change the hair. This one's worse than the original because it moves.
[3618.82s -> 3625.48s]  All right. I need- It looks fine. All right. I got to change the hair.
[3634.17s -> 3651.02s]  No, it's really messy. Turn down the corners. I don't think I even can at this point. No,
[3651.02s -> 3663.78s]  it's got to be messy and dirty. No, I mean that's- That's probably as good as it's going to get.
[3670.49s -> 3682.26s]  Yeah, that's good. We got to get him to talk. Let's see. How do I get you to talk?
[3693.29s -> 3711.10s]  How am I dressed like a Jedi? Hold on. I got to change this clothes. Add a personality trait. I
[3711.10s -> 3715.18s]  will. Hold on. I got to get this right. It was like a- It was a gray tank top.
[3722.63s -> 3736.58s]  Gray tank top. That's what we're looking for. No. Wait. Just like that. All right. But it was- Yeah,
[3736.58s -> 3742.31s]  that looks good. I don't know. I wasn't wearing pants probably that day. No, I had to have been,
[3742.31s -> 3759.43s]  right? I need a bigger forehead. I'll fix it. This needs to be gray. I can get that image off
[3759.43s -> 3772.42s]  the screen. It looks horrible. I need a bigger forehead. That's accurate. I think that's accurate.
[3772.42s -> 3790.25s]  How much bigger? Like right there. What was it before? I don't think I can even make the
[3790.25s -> 3799.94s]  forehead bigger unless I put the whole face down. Oh, just don't do that. Fix the eyes.
[3802.68s -> 3812.34s]  Don't touch it. I can't wait for the first close-up smile we get of this character.
[3812.34s -> 3826.14s]  Nose needs to be bigger? I don't think it does, man. I mean, it does that.
[3829.32s -> 3844.31s]  Corners, please. I can't. All right. Corners. Mouth corners rotate. Oh, that's where the weird
[3844.31s -> 3857.99s]  skin flap things are coming from. All right. Yeah. Right there. Okay. All right. Let's do
[3857.99s -> 3870.42s]  personality. Pablo Herbie. Pablo Herbie. Pablo Herbie. That's mine. All right. Favorite food.
[3870.42s -> 3883.67s]  Cookies. Favorite food is tri-tip steak, classical music, and favorite color is gray. You're a,
[3884.71s -> 3892.10s]  what are you, a Virgo? Oh, no. You could be a, who cares? You could be a, yeah, fine.
[3892.10s -> 3898.90s]  All right. What are your traits? The sus guy is like scary, right? And he's sus. So we've got,
[3902.26s -> 3913.82s]  like, where's like liar? Perceptive. Very perceptive. Perceptive sims make keen
[3913.82s -> 3917.90s]  investigators. Their ability to investigate and stake out potential criminals is bar none.
[3917.90s -> 3932.52s]  And they're also suspicious. Where's suspicious? Okay. Uh, vegetarian, unlucky, supernatural fan,
[3934.58s -> 3941.46s]  shy, schmoozer. I feel like schmoozer, right? Like you have to, you can talk. You can talk,
[3941.46s -> 3958.47s]  talk, talk, talk, talk. Yep. Holy shit. It opened its mouth. Hmm. Nurturing? No. Neurotic? Neat?
[3958.55s -> 3973.29s]  IT? If you're an imposter, you're a loner. It's only you and maybe one other person. How about,
[3973.29s -> 3984.28s]  um, handy? Yeah, I'm looking handy. I can fake my tasks like better than anybody else.
[3984.28s -> 4001.19s]  Genius? Evil? Oh yeah. Insane? No, I don't think an imposter, no, that's not insane.
[4003.38s -> 4016.81s]  Computer whiz. Eco-friendly? Computer whiz. Yeah, cause they're playing, he's playing among us.
[4016.81s -> 4027.38s]  He's really good at it. Isn't that, what do you, what do you mean? Or wait, is he's just supposed
[4027.38s -> 4032.01s]  to be the carrot? Wait, he's not playing? All right, hold on. I don't, no, guys, I, the meme is
[4032.01s -> 4038.92s]  of my face. I don't even know what the fuck it's talking about. I have no idea what it's even
[4038.92s -> 4048.12s]  referring to. I've not played one minute of Among Us. I don't even know what it is. These are things
[4048.12s -> 4054.49s]  I've heard other popular streamers say. Oh, my tasks. Okay. I'm just gonna pretend I know what
[4054.49s -> 4060.04s]  that is. Oh, I can fake my tasks. Oh, dude, when you were at admin, I don't know any of these things.
[4060.04s -> 4069.85s]  It's fine. But if it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. How about, um, disciplined? You don't need skill
[4069.85s -> 4085.86s]  and computers to play Among Us. Insane. Why is, why insane? I thought you had to be like smart and
[4085.86s -> 4094.26s]  collected and ruthless and insane. I thought the best imposters are ones that were very smart and
[4094.26s -> 4102.50s]  meticulous. They're not like crazy. They kill people. Oh shit, this is modded sims. He actually
[4102.50s -> 4111.53s]  might kill someone. Okay. Uh, you aspire to be a master of mysticism, the emperor of evil.
[4111.53s -> 4126.26s]  This is actually fine. Okay, there's the sus guy. Uh, all right, let's go. I don't want to have like
[4126.26s -> 4134.79s]  more than five to 10 people. So we got it. We got to, let's make up just a crazy, an insane person.
[4134.79s -> 4144.71s]  I'll make, I'll make a few pets too. Don't worry. You have to make Stewie Griffin. I can't make
[4144.71s -> 4161.77s]  Stewie. Can I make Stewie Griffin? Okay. He already, he's got Stewie here already. What does
[4161.77s -> 4176.76s]  Stewie's head look like? It's like, I'm going to attempt this once. I don't think I can press the
[4176.76s -> 4203.59s]  head down. No family guy. No family guy. Should we just skip? No family guy. No family guy. No family
[4203.59s -> 4211.69s]  guy. Okay. Just run a poll. It's just, it's a family guy. Yes or no. That's it. While you figure
[4211.69s -> 4229.48s]  that out, I'm making somebody else. How do I? Okay. Well, Stewie's here. Yeah, run a poll. We'll find
[4229.48s -> 4246.70s]  out what people want. Okay. Let's, okay. Let's stick with this. Okay. What are we making now?
[4250.52s -> 4258.52s]  I'm just so inclined to drag this bar to like here. I'm not making, I'm not making Lois enough.
[4259.16s -> 4268.12s]  Just hit random. I don't know if it's going to do anything. Oh, it doesn't do the sliders.
[4268.68s -> 4281.96s]  It does not do the sliders. Make it a different, make a different. Oh shit. Hold on. Werewolf,
[4281.96s -> 4288.89s]  fairy, witch. Should this be a witch? I guess it's like October, right?
[4290.25s -> 4303.53s]  Halloween's coming up. Make Chris Pratt's Mario. But where do you guys think we're going to go?
[4303.53s -> 4308.41s]  Let's talk about the Mario. I haven't even talked about like any of the Nintendo stuff. So the Mario
[4308.41s -> 4314.90s]  movie, you didn't know, right? We've got Chris Pratt. We've got Seth Rogen. How, where on the
[4314.90s -> 4324.34s]  scale of it's just the actor talking to it's a me are we going to be on that spectrum? What do
[4324.34s -> 4333.72s]  you guys think? You think it's, we're just going to get, it's just the actor talking. I don't think
[4333.72s -> 4340.06s]  we're going to. You think we're going to get full on fake, just Mario and Luigi. I don't, I don't
[4340.06s -> 4352.89s]  think so. Said he was going to do it. You know, when I sit here and I think of a Chris Pratt doing
[4352.89s -> 4362.81s]  a Mario impression, I, it's like, I, I could see him doing that. I could see it happening, right?
[4362.81s -> 4376.28s]  I don't know if it's going to be any good. No family guy. Uh-oh. Well, he is an actor.
[4376.28s -> 4391.82s]  It's like an SNL joke. I mean, should I, should I make the, is Elon Musk going to be Wario tweet?
[4391.82s -> 4403.24s]  Somebody else are probably already did like 10 times. I mean, like that's, if I think of something
[4403.24s -> 4408.30s]  funny and I go, oh, that's like kind of humorous to me. I think of how many times somebody else
[4408.30s -> 4417.08s]  may have tweeted it. And if it's over one to 2000 times, I go, nah, whatever. The N64 tweet was
[4417.08s -> 4425.91s]  funny. I mean, let's be honest. Look, okay. I haven't even started playing the Sims and we're
[4425.91s -> 4432.25s]  going to get in a small little problem that I have here. So the N64 Sega Genesis stuff,
[4432.25s -> 4438.82s]  they're making a big deal out of this, but they, they've done this shit like three times already.
[4438.82s -> 4443.94s]  And I think it's just every new generation of gamers, they wipe out the last place you
[4443.94s -> 4449.08s]  could possibly do all this and play all this stuff because like a bunch of new gamers aren't like,
[4449.08s -> 4452.28s]  they don't know that like you could have got this on the virtual console like 10 years ago.
[4454.70s -> 4465.35s]  And it's like the new thing. You can play Super Mario 64 kids. Whoops. We fucking deleted it.
[4465.35s -> 4471.64s]  And I am not convinced. I am not convinced that this is going to be a good service because look
[4471.64s -> 4478.70s]  at the Super Nintendo shit. What was the last Super Nintendo update? Like three months ago,
[4478.70s -> 4484.34s]  two months ago, we get like, what do you get claymates? Like in a quarter, like one quarter,
[4484.34s -> 4493.82s]  you get like two or three games. It's just, it's not enough. Every time I see that, like, holy
[4493.82s -> 4500.76s]  shit, there's something new on the NES catalog. I forget that it even exists because it takes too
[4500.76s -> 4510.47s]  long. Look, they have like 10 games that they want to come out with and then like five more
[4510.47s -> 4514.39s]  that they want to add later. What about after that? Are we going to get in the same scenario
[4514.39s -> 4524.68s]  where they just release like one N64 game every three months? Like what the hell? What is Mike?
[4524.68s -> 4541.53s]  No! Audition for Waluigi right now. All right. Everybody cheated but me, Mario. It's me,
[4541.53s -> 4561.98s]  Waluigi. Did I get the part? I love Jerma because I like when he does the intentional quench.
[4562.54s -> 4583.86s]  Oh, let's make a witch. What a fucking song. Uh, you know what's fine? We'll come up with
[4583.86s -> 4591.62s]  the name after we figure out what they want to look like. Make Gruntilda. Okay. How about just
[4591.62s -> 4614.42s]  Grunty? I like Grunty flush. Okay. What Grunty is here? I need a picture of Grunty. Audition
[4614.42s -> 4631.67s]  for Gruntilda right now? Okay. Sure. That was good. I don't care who says it wasn't. It was
[4631.67s -> 4645.85s]  fucking really good. All right. What does she look like? Uh, all right. So we're going to have to do
[4645.85s -> 4665.53s]  the slider. Which, which, which? Uh, unironically good. Hey, thanks. All right. I got to get to the
[4665.53s -> 4677.02s]  face. So really, does every character that I make have to have a long thin chin? Is that,
[4677.02s -> 4681.82s]  is this just like the trope of my whole channel? It's like, look at how long their chin is.
[4684.95s -> 4694.42s]  I make a character that doesn't have a long chin. You have to make hot Gruntilda. Uh, is that what
[4694.42s -> 4701.10s]  this image, this Google image search is showing me? Is that what I'm getting on the Google image
[4701.10s -> 4723.59s]  search? I was curious. What are you talking about? Uh, I, I'm going with N64, just Gruntilda from
[4723.59s -> 4734.23s]  the opening cut scene. Never played it. I did play it. I played it enough to, um, I don't know,
[4734.23s -> 4738.39s]  I think I got like 10 puzzle pieces, 20 puzzle pieces. And I lit it up at one of my friend's
[4738.39s -> 4747.61s]  houses. All right. Here we go. Really big eyes, like very, very big guys, like huge, massive.
[4748.25s -> 4753.46s]  And they're pretty close together and they take up a majority of her entire face.
[4761.42s -> 4774.60s]  They're huge. Not that far away. They're pretty close and they're tilted down a little bit.
[4775.24s -> 4789.30s]  I got to change the eye sockets like that. They're kind of tilted like that. There we go.
[4793.62s -> 4808.52s]  Making an anime character. All right. Can we get a witch's hat? The eyelids need to be changed.
[4808.52s -> 4823.05s]  These need to come down a bit. I bet that helped at all, but whatever. All right. Looks good.
[4824.63s -> 4831.72s]  I just want to make sure you can still see the eye. There we go. Are her eyes still red?
[4831.72s -> 4845.16s]  All right. Here we go. We need to do, this is like a long witch nose. Okay. It's pretty close
[4845.16s -> 4865.72s]  already. There's gotta be some weight here though. Maybe not that big. Uh, I'm not, I'm,
[4865.72s -> 4887.72s]  I'm not touching this one. Oh, okay. So that's way too big. That's better. Bigger. I think that's
[4887.72s -> 4904.18s]  good. Her face is thinner though. Yeah. The face is too, it's, she's too, the face is too thick.
[4904.74s -> 4941.05s]  Face height. I gotta get rid of the hair. There it is. It's better. This is how just every crazy
[4941.05s -> 4947.26s]  son of a bitch sees people. He's pretty, wait, huh? This is how I see people. All right. Pull
[4947.26s -> 4976.14s]  these cheeks in. That's a little better. Better. Better. We're getting close. This is a mosquito.
[4976.14s -> 4983.74s]  No, this is Gruntilda. I think the face is even longer. I think I have to go real kind of crazy
[4983.74s -> 5006.65s]  with this. It's, it's like that. It's long. This is like fucking pizza cheese dripping out of her chin.
[5007.53s -> 5031.32s]  Okay. Okay. That looks good. Now I gotta get a witch's hat. The eye is fine. The nose is fine.
[5033.72s -> 5039.64s]  The mouth hold on the mouth though. Wait, this has a mouth hook. I need that. Is there like a
[5039.64s -> 5046.52s]  front picture of Gruntilda? It's a, it's a little, it's kind of, it's got a big wide mouth.
[5047.48s -> 5065.30s]  How deep is that mouth? Like kind of like that. Definition looks good. Yep. Looks,
[5066.02s -> 5080.54s]  that looks good. All right. The width, height and width right underneath her nose in a way,
[5080.54s -> 5091.35s]  like right here. Is this the whole game? I would say this is probably arguably one of the more
[5091.35s -> 5094.63s]  important. I mean, I'm going to be streaming for a long time. This is not going to be like a three
[5094.63s -> 5103.43s]  hour, four hour stream. We're going pretty much all day. I need green skin. I don't know. Hold on.
[5103.43s -> 5119.98s]  I gotta get this right first. I don't like how happy that mouth is. You understand? That's not,
[5119.98s -> 5141.70s]  that mouth is too happy. There we go. All right. Uh, green Gruntilda. Already wearing purple.
[5149.32s -> 5161.00s]  She bald? No, she got long hair under the hat though. Is there a witch's hat? Of course there is.
[5165.14s -> 5174.62s]  That. I don't, which one? There's some hair under there. Isn't there?
[5175.74s -> 5197.10s]  This is a Karen witch. All right. Now we just need, we did like a cake. Clothing. Let's go with,
[5198.54s -> 5205.38s]  uh, yeah. I want outfits. All right. Can I make this black and purple?
[5205.62s -> 5210.79s]  Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Remember that one.
[5218.17s -> 5237.77s]  The top is fine. All right. Hold on. Shit. No, I need the other parts and it's white on the bottom.
[5237.77s -> 5244.01s]  I think this is perfect. I don't, I don't think we're going to get much better than that. Honestly
[5244.01s -> 5256.60s]  God. Shorter legs. I don't think you can do height. Yeah. Height is not an option.
[5257.24s -> 5276.49s]  I just have witch's shoes though. Witch shoes. They have witch shoes. We can just do these.
[5277.45s -> 5303.61s]  I like boots actually. Hold on. I think these are fine. These are fine. This is a black.
[5304.41s -> 5320.78s]  I guess they already were. Oh shit. Wait, no. Let's do different colors. All right.
[5320.78s -> 5337.96s]  Uh, I believe now it's to personality traits. No, no, no, no, no, no. All right. She's evil.
[5338.76s -> 5356.33s]  I don't, I don't know much about her. Piledish probably powered. She's evil and she rhymes.
[5356.41s -> 5376.54s]  Okay. All right. Okay. Eccentric evil. I would say great kisser. Grumpy. She's grunt Hilda, obviously.
[5384.09s -> 5399.72s]  Okay. How about a loser? Mean spirit. Probably neurotic, right? Hates children.
[5403.72s -> 5420.07s]  Supernatural fan. I mean, come on. Green thumb. I'll take away eccentric.
[5423.06s -> 5434.38s]  We'll do, what should I replace it with? Rooting. Insane works. Everybody in the house is going to
[5434.38s -> 5442.33s]  be insane. Green thumb. Because she's a witch. She's green. Why do you want me to do that?
[5447.43s -> 5459.03s]  Family oriented. She eats children. Okay. Yeah. That's, that dislikes children. That's a good one.
[5459.91s -> 5473.91s]  She eat kids? What are you talking about? Yeah. What do you, I don't remember that.
[5477.40s -> 5483.00s]  All right. We got to go back. I got to remove this. Stuart Flush just got to go.
[5483.64s -> 5495.11s]  Unless I change this into something else. How do I delete this person? I'll get to leave. All right.
[5495.11s -> 5511.99s]  Hold on. I want to make a dog or a horse. Make young Sheldon. Oh, please let me, let me do this.
[5511.99s -> 5522.60s]  Come on. All right. Elder pet. Make the horse look human. I, that's what I'm going to try to do. I'm
[5522.60s -> 5530.26s]  going to try to make it a person's face. All right. Oreo cookie one. Shape. Oh my God. Please.
[5535.10s -> 5540.92s]  Wait, are there no sliders? There are no sliders. I don't think.
[5543.19s -> 5571.69s]  Body. Oh, come on. Really? Advanced mode. Please. Oh God. That's it? What? Do I have to change this in
[5571.69s -> 5585.40s]  the, in the setting somewhere to make it so that animals can do it too? Thank God for no sliders.
[5585.40s -> 5599.26s]  Click the head. Damn it. Oh, it only does it. It only does it for people, not animals.
[5602.66s -> 5611.16s]  Make a pet out of a person. I think I can, somebody said I can pause and edit them in the game and
[5611.16s -> 5619.86s]  change them. We'll try that. All right. Well, let me get this right. This is first. That just scared
[5619.86s -> 5628.58s]  me. I forgot this person existed. Okay. Let's go with the horse's name here. Let's back it up.
[5628.58s -> 5644.74s]  We'll just make the horse face region. Ears scale. All right. Whatever. We'll come back in later and
[5644.74s -> 5656.20s]  see if I can fix it. I'm gonna get out of here. Oh, basic. All right. Well, what's the horse's name?
[5666.86s -> 5683.11s]  Oreo cookie. I like Oreo. Oh wait, I can do personality. Hold on. All right. I have to make one
[5683.11s -> 5694.84s]  just absolute mutant person. Sure. I am not gonna hold back at all. This is going to be insane.
[5696.84s -> 5700.36s]  I'm going to try to make this person the most fucked up I possibly could.
[5728.89s -> 5752.14s]  Mr. Green? No, it's not Mr. Green. Oh, make sure he's got a big chin. Oh,
[5754.12s -> 5760.34s]  at this point, this, this just doesn't even matter. How about all the way down?
[5761.06s -> 5773.99s]  What's the cheekbones? Oh, that's disgusting. Looks like the mouth.
[5778.58s -> 5798.94s]  He can't sit. I can't, I gotta change this. Oh, I feel like the, I feel like his head just went
[5798.94s -> 5818.31s]  through with a hydraulic press video. What the fuck? No. All right. I like that. That's fine.
[5823.77s -> 5849.45s]  Oh, it's not, it's so, it's wrong. It's just wrong. I made their face inside out. Keep it.
[5852.12s -> 5883.61s]  Where the eyes go? Shit. Hold on. Holy shit. Uh, I feel like this is the, I feel like this
[5883.61s -> 5907.45s]  character's from Hellraiser because the eyes upside down. No, I want to be able to actually
[5907.45s -> 5911.54s]  even look at this. I'll fix it. This is too much. I don't like this. This is scaring me.
[5911.54s -> 5917.91s]  It's scary. This is really scary. I don't like it. I don't, it's Ben 10.
[5931.53s -> 5935.77s]  What's the, what's the character from Ben 10? What's the Ben 10 name of that monster? I know
[5935.77s -> 5946.58s]  who you're talking about. Ah, real monsters. It's the guy with the armpits, right? All right. Wait,
[5946.58s -> 5956.06s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's not get too over ahead here. Oh my God. We're
[5956.06s -> 5975.18s]  going to get jump scared randomly. Wow. Rotation. I don't even know what the nose is.
[5975.82s -> 5984.87s]  Where is the nose? No, not too wild. I want to be able to see the face. You know what I mean?

[6158.71s -> 6165.58s]  Choices? They're true. I'm not sure, but I want some time to maybe think about. Maybe I'll
[6165.58s -> 6171.98s]  have some food. Maybe I'll build a house. I don't care. It is time to begin the sims.
[6172.62s -> 6186.63s]  Go back a little bit. All right. That's fine. I'm done. This one actually might have to be

[8650.15s -> 8656.39s]  I always accidentally. I'm sorry. I make the first room in The Sims always gigantic. I don't know. I
[8656.39s -> 8671.16s]  don't know why. It's a weird habit where I just make a huge cube first. Those kids chairs. These
[8671.16s -> 8689.05s]  look like plastic kids chairs. Are they? Here we go. Save the game. Time to begin. What will our
[8689.05s -> 8714.31s]  Sims do this time? I agree. All right. Who's who? Who's who? Where am I going? Going to check out

[8823.08s -> 8830.04s]  Greetings. I'm Emmet Relevart. Oh, it's Rick. I'd like to use my time portal.
[8832.81s -> 8838.70s]  Oh, thanks for the portal. Help a time traveler out. Great woolly llamas. I was on my way home
[8838.70s -> 8842.30s]  to Oasis Landing and my time portal experienced a temporal disruption.
[8842.30s -> 8855.54s]  Find and collect the power cells on your lot. Why is he back up? Why is he back up?
[8858.28s -> 8868.52s]  Wait, wait. Did I, I think I broke him. Where's he going? Don't touch that. Don't touch that.
[8869.83s -> 8875.99s]  Hey, he's puking. He's puking in the bed. He's puking in the bed. I have to take him out.
[8890.18s -> 8892.42s]  How do I get rid of this? I want to get rid of this thing.
[8893.22s -> 8894.58s]  Summon the time traveler?
[8904.82s -> 8907.30s]  Okay. I don't want to, I don't want to collect any power cells.
[8907.86s -> 8922.84s]  That was the windmill windup was stupid. Okay. So can you get off the horse? Be petted. Hold on.
[8927.74s -> 8931.74s]  I don't want to do this yet. I don't want the horse to break Gruntilda's neck.
[8932.38s -> 8935.90s]  You know what I mean? I don't know what that means. I don't think I want to do that.
[8935.90s -> 8944.79s]  It's too, it's weird. It's been 10 seconds. I don't care about like punching
[8944.79s -> 8953.56s]  the Pickle Rick into the outer space. Suplex the horse, please.
[8954.76s -> 8961.27s]  Somebody's coming out. Somebody's coming in. This thing is making sounds again.
[8961.27s -> 8971.29s]  Jesus, that car went by fast. Someone's coming out. He's back.
[8971.29s -> 8996.70s]  I just like broke a bottle on his head. Wait, what? I tried to strike him with lightning and
[8996.70s -> 9006.81s]  didn't do anything. I just broke a Coke bottle on his head. What the fuck? Wait, what?
[9017.82s -> 9028.94s]  Oh, am I? Talk to cat. No, I want you to do the tectonic neck crack.
[9040.82s -> 9041.14s]  Joke.
[9051.34s -> 9053.58s]  What are you doing? What is he doing?
[9065.45s -> 9069.05s]  I'm scared. It was sus. All right. All right. I got to relax. I don't want to do anything.
[9069.05s -> 9072.33s]  I don't want to do it. What is this? Why is there ice cream? Buy ice cream?
[9073.29s -> 9079.61s]  Oh, by an ice cream. Get this guy to leave.
[9087.45s -> 9089.69s]  Grab head. All right. I want to get out of here.
[9098.94s -> 9106.84s]  What are you doing? I want this person to stop doing that and leave. I want to get this out of
[9106.84s -> 9134.98s]  the front lawn. Is he dead? Stop coming back as a different person. I want to get this person out
[9134.98s -> 9156.14s]  of the front lawn. I'm going to delete this. I can't delete this. This thing is so annoying.
[9156.14s -> 9160.78s]  I want it out of here.
[9168.70s -> 9169.82s]  Make it naked.
[9173.82s -> 9180.68s]  I'm so. Hold on a minute. Where's punch?
[9180.68s -> 9196.41s]  It's trying to figure out what to do.
[9214.38s -> 9218.94s]  This is getting way too weird. I got to reel this in. I'm going to reel this in.
[9220.06s -> 9229.21s]  I need to reel this in. All right. All right. All right. Thank you for coming. Leave.
[9229.21s -> 9245.35s]  Leave. Where's the cat? Okay. First things first. I asked this person to leave. I'm traveler.
[9248.58s -> 9261.16s]  What the fuck are you doing? Watch out for the cat. How's everybody's health doing?
[9261.16s -> 9263.00s]  We just keep breaking bottles on this guy's head.
[9263.00s -> 9271.59s]  I can't. All right. Ask him to leave. Ask him to leave. Ask him to leave.
[9274.23s -> 9281.94s]  Close the portal. I can't. Travel to the future. Reset the. I don't.
[9283.06s -> 9294.79s]  Just collect the cells. Oh my god. Fuck. All right. Fine. Not helping the time traveler. Who is?
[9295.27s -> 9314.52s]  Will you leave if I do this? Let's do town edit and you can move it wherever. Hold on.
[9321.43s -> 9331.21s]  All right. There's only one more. All right. Everyone. Everyone's doing fine.
[9337.11s -> 9348.20s]  When met the time traveler, even though he's dead. All right. Now talk to him more. Okay.
[9349.16s -> 9350.84s]  Oh, repair the time portal, please.
[9363.30s -> 9373.21s]  Okay. How's the cat doing? Okay. I've received a mean high five. Cool. All right.
[9374.01s -> 9375.77s]  Let me first reactivate the portal.
[9383.86s -> 9395.82s]  Thank god. All right. That was so annoying. What time is it? It's currently six thirty.
[9395.82s -> 9401.34s]  That was an interesting first day. How do we let the dog? All right. Let the let the dog in.
[9402.30s -> 9414.49s]  Uh, enter. I can sell the portal. No. Oh, thank god. Get this out of here.
[9415.61s -> 9417.42s]  But does this mean this guy's stuck here forever?
[9419.66s -> 9427.10s]  All right. Come on, horse. Let's get everybody in bed and we'll
[9427.74s -> 9444.73s]  actually start playing the game. Body slam the ghost. Fine. You can't get in. The horse wants
[9444.73s -> 9458.78s]  to get in. What are they doing? Why do they all want to go in here? I don't understand.
[9458.78s -> 9484.63s]  It needs to be a barn door. Okay. I need a barn door. Where would that be?
[9485.27s -> 9507.11s]  Horse is stuck. I don't know. It's indoors. Top row. Big red thing. Oh, okay. I can't do it.
[9507.11s -> 9526.26s]  Oh, shit. This is huge. So big. Damn it. This whole thing's fucked.
[9526.90s -> 9542.18s]  Maybe we shouldn't have put a horse in the house. Leave the useless room.
[9546.39s -> 9554.68s]  Right on the right side of the room. I don't think I can get it there to open up the wall.
[9555.48s -> 9582.79s]  I could try that. Let's see what happens. No walls. You just go in. Get in there. Come on.
[9587.83s -> 9599.19s]  Hey. All right. Nice. Okay. You guys have to get out of the way.
[9599.83s -> 9604.07s]  All right. So you're going to go in.
[9604.07s -> 9623.42s]  You can't go in. He wants to read a book. Oh, there we go. Perfect.
[9633.66s -> 9635.66s]  Can we seriously get this guy out of here for real?
[9635.66s -> 9660.28s]  Oh, can I bite his neck?
[9660.84s -> 9666.36s]  Get out of my house. Get. Leave my house. How do I call a grim reaper?
[9676.62s -> 9685.29s]  Cat watching TV. Ask to leave. I don't think I can.
[9693.91s -> 9708.87s]  Make awkward drama. Wait, wait, everybody. Wait a second.
[9729.78s -> 9738.94s]  What was that? Everybody leave. You want to eat the horse? What's wrong with the cat?
[9739.58s -> 9777.98s]  Oh, I bet that probably felt really weird. I have to help the cat.
[9779.61s -> 9784.76s]  All right. What does the cat need? Where's the needs bars? All right. Fun. I need to.
[9786.12s -> 9787.00s]  What are you doing?
[9790.97s -> 9805.34s]  What did you say? What's wrong with them? Eat food. This guy's still standing in the house.
[9806.73s -> 9809.77s]  Litter box. What's wrong with it? It's right there.
[9817.98s -> 9822.02s]  Somebody take care of this. All right. We have 25 grand. We're going to be fine.
[9826.87s -> 9832.90s]  You somebody get up. Grunt held to get up or you wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
[9833.70s -> 9838.95s]  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. Let's go care.
[9841.35s -> 9848.79s]  Pick up pet and hang out. I think this person's I don't know why they're still here.
[9850.07s -> 9856.52s]  I'm here. Come here. Come here. Come here. I'm sorry. I made the cat twerk.
[9861.11s -> 9863.03s]  Here. Let's nip hand. Come here.
[9863.03s -> 9866.25s]  Let's go.
[9872.06s -> 9872.86s]  Litter box. Right here.
[9879.85s -> 9888.04s]  Okay. How's the cat? The cat needs to have fun. Run around. Need some toys. Don't I have
[9888.04s -> 9898.23s]  something like a cat toy? Oh, wait. Yeah. Give me a cat toy. Oh my God. Okay. That's
[9899.26s -> 9911.29s]  at a like a scratching post. Yeah. Oh, one of these things. Look, check it out.
[9919.45s -> 9926.23s]  What the hell was that? He just fart out of his head. What just happened? I was on top of him,
[9926.23s -> 9942.15s]  punching him. These, they're all insane. I don't even know what to do. Somebody has to get a job.
[9942.15s -> 9952.82s]  All right. Stop running around. Where's the horse? Oh, the horse is fine. Okay.
[9952.82s -> 9967.83s]  Can one of you actually go into the bed? I go have an evil slumber. I feel like I'm missing
[9967.83s -> 9974.30s]  somebody. You're in bed. You're in bed. You're here. You're in bed. Oh, you're here. Okay.
[9975.10s -> 9997.66s]  Ask to pillow fight. No, go to sleep. Get over there. Um, where are you going? What a fucking
[9997.66s -> 10022.07s]  moron. What a moron. Where are you going? What do you mean sleep in Grunty's bed? It's a bunk bed.
[10031.46s -> 10039.85s]  He has to go in from the left. Okay. I have to get rid of this person right now. The beds can't be
[10039.85s -> 10063.62s]  against a wall. Oh, they count as double beds. This guy, I don't even know how he did that. How
[10063.62s -> 10081.48s]  did you do that? How did you do that? What? This guy climbed the wall into the duct. Okay. Interesting.
[10081.48s -> 10100.89s]  All right. So I need to feed the cat. That's hungry. Eat from the bowl. I mean, like I wanted
[10100.89s -> 10121.18s]  this guy out of here. No torture. The ladders on the wrong side. Okay. I'll fix it. I'm not dropping
[10121.18s -> 10131.32s]  a meteor on the house. All right. Is everybody awake? Straight. All right. You need to go bed.
[10137.61s -> 10144.73s]  Everyone's good. It is, uh, currently 3 0 2 a.m. And the game just crashed. There we go.
[10146.58s -> 10154.34s]  What are you doing? What are you doing? You're ruining the furniture. Stop.
[10154.98s -> 10182.10s]  Stop it. Ask him to leave. Well, I gotta wait. Measel door. Can the cat body slam this guy?
[10197.56s -> 10208.95s]  Shift click the ghost to delete him. I can't. He loved that. I just keep re-killing him.
[10209.51s -> 10224.81s]  Doesn't the grim reaper come? You have to enable shift clicking. Use the NR. Oh, delete him with
[10224.81s -> 10234.46s]  this. Oh, how do I delete him? Just literally ask him to leave. All right. I'll try that.
[10236.58s -> 10251.45s]  Oh, okay. You there's Emmett. Why do I only have I can only hurt people because I don't think he's
[10251.45s -> 10264.10s]  a I don't think he counts as a person. Yeah, he doesn't count as a person. Just wind up and
[10264.10s -> 10275.59s]  punch him out of existence again. Holy shit. That's a great idea. What was it called? It was
[10278.20s -> 10291.45s]  demonic powers, telekinetic slam. No, what was it? Violence and aggression. Why punch?
[10292.41s -> 10296.39s]  Yeah, that's it. Get him out of here. Get the fuck out of here now.
[10301.66s -> 10316.89s]  Fuck off. What is going on right here? What's happening? Why is the horse blurred? The horse
[10317.61s -> 10323.08s]  blur. All right. Hold on. Restless. Oh, wait, let's go. Let's go for a ride.
[10323.80s -> 10340.89s]  The horse have a phone? Where'd you go? All right, you just run around. Don't even fucking think
[10340.89s -> 10358.17s]  about it. I just heard another magical sound. Bronte just met the time traveler. What? Bronte's
[10358.17s -> 10395.74s]  asleep. Does this work? What's wrong with this guy? That doesn't work. All right. Somebody get a job.
[10395.74s -> 10412.81s]  Have a water balloon fight with everybody. Is he stuck in the wall? What are they doing over there?
[10421.24s -> 10423.40s]  I do hear him in the wall. I can hear his spell shit.
[10423.40s -> 10433.51s]  Shit. Dirty dishes already?
[10437.66s -> 10453.70s]  Check the walls. I don't see him. Is he on the roof? I don't think no. I think he's just glitched.
[10454.34s -> 10466.01s]  Need to hire a maid? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will. Good idea. That might just be Bronte Hilda making
[10466.01s -> 10481.90s]  that sound. I need a phone. Phone, phone, phone, telephone. Oh, wait, it's the Sims 3. They have
[10481.90s -> 10503.66s]  cell phones. I forgot. I grunt Hilda call. Telephone. Do a service. Oh, service. Call Amelia.
[10507.90s -> 10513.06s]  All right, get a maid over here. I think the time machine's trying to spawn back in,
[10513.06s -> 10519.82s]  but you fucked with this time space continuum. Okay, maid.
[10523.18s -> 10531.48s]  How's the cat doing? Cat's okay. Horse is okay. Can I take the horse into town?

[10785.45s -> 10793.19s]  Okay, Grunty just yelled at someone.
[10799.83s -> 10801.27s]  No, I want a good luck charm.

[11045.59s -> 11052.07s]  to do that again. I'm not going to drop an absolute meteor storm. It just kills everybody.
[11052.79s -> 11075.50s]  I just had to see what it did. That was so loud, I know. I have it turned down. I'm actually kind
[11075.50s -> 11080.38s]  of... The thing is, it might be autonomous. I think it actually might be autonomous.
[11082.01s -> 11091.83s]  It might just be a meteor that hits the house one day. Okay, they're just doing whatever they're
[11091.83s -> 11103.27s]  doing. Okay, you've... Aching back? Humiliated, smelly, and enemy. I don't know why they're doing

[11862.52s -> 11867.43s]  Why is there just evil slumber?
[11867.99s -> 11870.70s]  All right. You need to turn back to your normal form.
[11870.70s -> 11875.93s]  I keep forgetting that's not werewolf. You need to transform back to
[11877.83s -> 11881.11s]  werewolf transformed to human form. Stop doing that and transform back.
[11881.67s -> 11889.59s]  Okay. Get some sleep.

[11946.58s -> 11955.96s]  Clean that up. Okay. Take a shower.
[11957.90s -> 11959.18s]  Who am I? What do you mean woohoo?
[11959.90s -> 11964.52s]  I didn't even put a face cam on. I'm not putting a face cam on.

[11976.38s -> 11981.32s]  Why is he? He woke up in werewolf form.
[11984.87s -> 11986.87s]  Peril instincts prevent that from happening.
[11990.12s -> 11997.14s]  Eating leftover waffles. Didn't we just make waffles right here?
[11997.86s -> 12007.70s]  Because his mood is bad. Oh. All right. Everybody eat.

[12030.76s -> 12034.04s]  I want you to punch yourself. I wanted you.
[12034.04s -> 12038.12s]  Somebody just punched himself in the face outside. I want you to punch yourself.
[12039.99s -> 12041.83s]  Stop you from doing the weird shit you were doing.
[12043.19s -> 12045.98s]  Is it raining? I thought that was film grain.
[12057.13s -> 12062.15s]  Okay. We need to have an activity out here. Something fun.
[12070.65s -> 12077.93s]  Fire pit. Oh dude. A Ribbit Ribbit Froggy McFrog slide. Are you kidding me?
[12077.93s -> 12097.24s]  How are we doing on horses? Good. Go slide.

[12163.59s -> 12172.82s]  That was a straight up belly flop dude. That hurts. This is fun right?
[12172.82s -> 12184.74s]  Yeah. Where's the cat? He's running to the bathroom.
[12184.74s -> 12200.42s]  Why do they have to pee so much? Do you feel like they all pee and poo like five times a day?
[12201.38s -> 12213.93s]  You brought your cell phone into the bathtub. Answer the phone.
[12216.33s -> 12218.97s]  Who is it? I thought his pants were at his ankles.
[12219.93s -> 12236.84s]  Who was it? I want to take him back to the house where the person was.
[12241.06s -> 12246.74s]  Keep doing it. Everybody else is doing okay. You hungry. Is there more waffles?
[12249.90s -> 12254.46s]  No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop. I want those. Oh okay. I thought she was throwing them away.
[12255.02s -> 12270.18s]  Go for a pee break. It's been three hours. I'm all right. Let me like in like ten minutes.
[12277.14s -> 12296.34s]  I forgot. I think I added a gun. I think I added like weapons and I'm afraid to open.
[12298.76s -> 12301.49s]  Hold on, sort by outdoor.
[12301.49s -> 12302.57s]  Where is it?
[12302.57s -> 12315.39s]  I don't know where it is. Storage.
[12315.39s -> 12322.34s]  Oh, I forget where it is.
[12322.34s -> 12324.82s]  If I have room, it's like outdoor, I think.
[12326.15s -> 12328.47s]  Outdoor cooking, outdoor decorations, outdoor.
[12328.47s -> 12330.03s]  No, where is it?
[12330.03s -> 12333.86s]  I don't remember.
[12333.86s -> 12335.14s]  It's in toys.
[12335.14s -> 12342.30s]  Don't see it.
[12342.30s -> 12346.82s]  Maybe not. I thought I added it, though.
[12346.82s -> 12348.06s]  That's all right. Let's go.
[12356.30s -> 12359.66s]  Is it raining in the house?
[12359.66s -> 12360.66s]  Jigna.
[12361.66s -> 12366.87s]  All right, I want to take you.
[12366.87s -> 12374.94s]  I want you in a good mood, so go to bed.
[12374.94s -> 12375.94s]  Go to sleep.
[12377.99s -> 12381.42s]  Enough playing out here. Let's go.
[12381.42s -> 12382.70s]  The horse has to get censored.
[12382.70s -> 12390.46s]  Yeah, I don't know why. That's weird.
[12390.46s -> 12396.36s]  All right, get in bed.
[12396.36s -> 12402.66s]  No more playing. I need you up bright and early.
[12402.66s -> 12412.09s]  I want to ride the horse into town.
[12412.09s -> 12414.54s]  Ice cream?
[12414.54s -> 12415.54s]  Yeah, get one.
[12423.59s -> 12424.75s]  What are you going to get?
[12424.75s -> 12433.23s]  How about a freezer bunny popsicle?
[12433.23s -> 12443.26s]  Nice. All right, cool.
[12443.26s -> 12446.22s]  Mount affection, feed produce.
[12446.22s -> 12447.22s]  Yeah.
[12447.70s -> 12450.02s]  Here, have an apple.
[12450.02s -> 12462.18s]  How cute is this going to be? Let's find out.
[12462.18s -> 12468.27s]  That's pretty cute.
[12468.27s -> 12477.70s]  Egg for carrots.
[12477.70s -> 12479.50s]  Oh, horses are so cool.
[12486.60s -> 12491.46s]  You got water over here?
[12491.46s -> 12495.10s]  OK, I want you to wake up because we're bringing you to town.
[12495.10s -> 12498.79s]  What are you doing? Yeah. All right, sleep.
[12498.79s -> 12500.67s]  These beds are so bad. Look at this energy.
[12500.67s -> 12503.18s]  It's fucking awful.
[12503.18s -> 12506.26s]  You have to sleep for like 16 hours to get even half of our energy.
[12506.26s -> 12511.36s]  I'm thrown away.
[12511.36s -> 12516.80s]  Go in a different bed.
[12516.80s -> 12524.14s]  All these idiots just sleep in sleeping bags anyways.
[12524.14s -> 12535.03s]  Yeah, here we go. Here.
[12535.03s -> 12549.06s]  Wake up. Go sleep in that other bed, man.
[12549.06s -> 12550.06s]  Get rid of this.
[12555.54s -> 12560.64s]  There we go. That's much better.
[12560.64s -> 12565.99s]  Did the horse just do the slide?
[12565.99s -> 12572.22s]  What?
[12572.22s -> 12576.06s]  That was awesome.
[12582.88s -> 12585.68s]  Oh, I didn't do it that time.
[12585.68s -> 12586.76s]  The horse isn't really good at health.
[12586.76s -> 12588.28s]  All right, go. I want the horse to go to sleep too.
[12588.28s -> 12597.65s]  Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
[12597.65s -> 12603.65s]  I love this horse.
[12603.65s -> 12605.37s]  OK, then I'm going to ride you into town.
[12605.37s -> 12607.81s]  We're going to go. I'm going to call that
[12607.81s -> 12612.43s]  a concerning amount of water accumulating.
[12617.74s -> 12619.18s]  I mean, kind of.
[12622.34s -> 12629.73s]  It's taking so long for you to.
[12629.73s -> 12632.88s]  There is actually a concerning amount of water coming in here.
[12632.88s -> 12637.48s]  This is very this heavy, heavy rain.
[12637.48s -> 12643.94s]  It's kind of freaked me out.
[12643.94s -> 12659.40s]  Uh, are we good?
[12659.40s -> 12664.98s]  OK, now eat something.
[12664.98s -> 12666.58s]  What do you guys eat?
[12667.06s -> 12672.43s]  Then I'm going to take him into town.
[12672.43s -> 12674.07s]  Are you cool to?
[12679.35s -> 12681.23s]  What happened to his face?
[12681.23s -> 12682.79s]  Oh, I thought his mouth was down here.
[12682.79s -> 12684.39s]  I thought that was his teeth.
[12685.67s -> 12686.87s]  I think it is.
[12696.54s -> 12697.54s]  Oh, God.
[12701.10s -> 12709.91s]  Get out of the bathtub.
[12709.91s -> 12711.99s]  Will you transform, please?
[12713.66s -> 12718.09s]  Transform back to a person, human.
[12719.21s -> 12727.75s]  Oh, all right, finally.
[12731.30s -> 12733.78s]  Now, what time is it? It's 11 o'clock.
[12733.78s -> 12738.62s]  You have to go back to bed again.
[12738.62s -> 12740.82s]  Artie's flush just saw what?
[12740.82s -> 12742.70s]  Oh, no, Grunty didn't.
[12742.70s -> 12746.82s]  I'm one grunty flush just saw a panicked horse for the first time.
[12747.54s -> 12748.94s]  Oh, my God. Get inside.
[12748.94s -> 12752.18s]  What are you doing?
[12752.18s -> 12755.21s]  Get inside. Get inside. Get inside.
[12755.21s -> 12760.09s]  Get inside. Quick, get inside.
[12764.31s -> 12768.89s]  Get in there.
[12768.89s -> 12773.02s]  Get out of the storm.
[12773.02s -> 12777.88s]  All right, now everyone's asleep again.
[12777.88s -> 12781.18s]  The horse pen doesn't have a roof.
[12786.54s -> 12795.63s]  Why? Is there a reason why?
[12795.63s -> 12806.29s]  Oh, Jesus.
[12806.29s -> 12808.85s]  Oh, I need it.
[12808.85s -> 12815.34s]  Oh, OK, how do I fix this?
[12815.34s -> 12820.95s]  How do I fix this?
[12820.95s -> 12826.30s]  This is OK. I got to fix this soon because this is scaring me.
[12826.30s -> 12836.94s]  I have to make a barn over here.
[12837.42s -> 12847.53s]  Right. How do I build a barn?
[12847.53s -> 12849.69s]  Is there a special thing to do?
[12849.69s -> 12857.23s]  Just put a roof on. It needs a closed wall.
[12857.23s -> 12863.78s]  Yeah, I can't. If I close this, he can't get out.
[12863.78s -> 12865.86s]  What is this even here for? You're right.
[12865.86s -> 12869.53s]  What am I? What's this even here for?
[12869.53s -> 12871.21s]  I haven't even used this space at all.
[12871.21s -> 12875.00s]  No one's been gone inside of here. Why am I using this?
[12875.00s -> 12889.59s]  What? Delete that.
[12889.59s -> 12899.60s]  Now I need a barn door.
[12899.60s -> 12904.82s]  Oh, stop. Really?
[12904.82s -> 12909.40s]  Two stories. Two stories.
[12909.40s -> 12911.08s]  This needs to be two stories tall.
[12911.12s -> 12934.70s]  Make a wall first. Oh, wall.
[12934.70s -> 12941.58s]  Are you high? Finish the wall.
[12941.58s -> 12951.92s]  What are you talking about? The wall's not finished?
[12951.92s -> 12957.37s]  I have to add a story.
[12957.37s -> 12958.57s]  That is delayed.
[12958.57s -> 12960.33s]  It has to be two. You can save.
[12960.33s -> 12962.37s]  Can you say barn door ten times fast?
[12962.37s -> 12967.81s]  Barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door.
[12967.81s -> 12974.30s]  Oh, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door.
[12974.30s -> 12977.07s]  Nobody can do it better than me.
[12977.07s -> 12982.10s]  All right. I actually never added a story.
[12982.10s -> 12984.12s]  Never in the sim.
[12984.12s -> 12987.19s]  I don't even know how to do it.
[12987.19s -> 12990.58s]  They add a story.
[12990.58s -> 13008.94s]  Create a room like up here.
[13008.94s -> 13022.66s]  OK, that's two stories.
[13022.66s -> 13024.94s]  There it is.
[13024.94s -> 13028.54s]  Hell, yeah. All right. Barn door.
[13028.54s -> 13042.89s]  And now I have to make the outside of this red.
[13042.89s -> 13050.49s]  OK, there we go.
[13050.49s -> 13055.62s]  Is there still no roof on it?
[13055.62s -> 13066.56s]  Was this still OK?
[13066.56s -> 13075.78s]  All right. There it is.
[13075.78s -> 13080.49s]  Now we're good.
[13080.49s -> 13081.97s]  Course is good.
[13081.97s -> 13084.58s]  Everything's fine.
[13084.58s -> 13088.77s]  Better living conditions here.
[13088.77s -> 13090.69s]  It's good.
[13090.69s -> 13093.22s]  Actually, inside, you don't have to be scared or anything.
[13093.22s -> 13095.12s]  All right.
[13097.94s -> 13111.40s]  Is there no food there? Is there food in there?
[13111.40s -> 13113.04s]  All right. Bladder. It's time for you to get up.
[13113.04s -> 13115.64s]  What time is it? One. OK.
[13128.27s -> 13130.23s]  OK. Three thirty in the morning.
[13130.23s -> 13134.77s]  That's fine. Get up.
[13134.77s -> 13138.31s]  Make breakfast.
[13138.31s -> 13140.75s]  How old is this?
[13140.75s -> 13143.99s]  Probably two. It's probably old.
[13143.99s -> 13147.61s]  Serve breakfast.
[13147.61s -> 13158.46s]  TV's backwards. No, it's not.
[13158.50s -> 13159.58s]  All right.
[13159.58s -> 13163.75s]  Oh, you're mad.
[13163.75s -> 13167.91s]  I told you to.
[13167.91s -> 13169.91s]  Horses asleep. Why did it groom this horse?
[13176.10s -> 13179.67s]  How do I shower?
[13179.67s -> 13182.93s]  How does the horse bathe?
[13182.93s -> 13195.92s]  He nap the horse.
[13195.92s -> 13201.74s]  You don't save the game now.
[13201.74s -> 13209.06s]  Why? I think maybe I have to be outside here.
[13209.06s -> 13217.27s]  Yeah, probably.
[13223.46s -> 13227.27s]  Why don't you come out?
[13227.27s -> 13233.85s]  Why is everybody all of a sudden want to go pet the horse?
[13233.85s -> 13236.37s]  OK, we got to get in there and clean up.
[13239.95s -> 13243.79s]  Clean. There we go.
[13243.79s -> 13246.75s]  Newbie. Well, I.
[13246.75s -> 13249.67s]  Aching back. Oh, you are cool.
[13249.67s -> 13251.95s]  They're shooting. Why do you mean aching back?
[13252.63s -> 13258.15s]  What? Oh, there's even aching back.
[13262.40s -> 13263.80s]  OK, care.
[13265.76s -> 13267.16s]  What are you doing?
[13267.16s -> 13270.54s]  Rush. OK, clean hooves.
[13270.54s -> 13272.50s]  No, get over here.
[13272.50s -> 13276.82s]  Where are you going?
[13276.82s -> 13292.38s]  Get out of the rain. Clean hooves.
[13298.69s -> 13303.02s]  I can't clean your hooves.
[13328.50s -> 13334.88s]  Damn it. Worth a shot.
[13334.88s -> 13346.22s]  Yeah, worth a shot.
[13346.22s -> 13354.42s]  You know, what was I trying to do?
[13354.42s -> 13356.98s]  I was trying to see from the mod editor that I could change
[13357.92s -> 13359.80s]  and do a full
[13361.49s -> 13362.81s]  whole creative character thing with it.
[13362.81s -> 13364.41s]  All right. I need to clean.
[13364.41s -> 13366.61s]  Please clean the hooves before.
[13366.61s -> 13368.33s]  This is ridiculous.
[13368.33s -> 13372.16s]  My body is so stupid.
[13372.84s -> 13374.24s]  Why are you so dumb?
[13376.97s -> 13379.13s]  Somebody clean the horse.
[13386.13s -> 13388.78s]  Clean the horse.
[13389.70s -> 13395.02s]  What are you guys doing?
[13396.15s -> 13408.62s]  What? I want to kick him in the face.
[13408.62s -> 13411.14s]  Why won't they?
[13411.14s -> 13414.31s]  Why? Why?
[13415.15s -> 13418.05s]  I know.
[13418.05s -> 13423.18s]  Nobody will clean the horse.
[13423.18s -> 13426.22s]  OK, well, let's keep a toony job.
[13426.82s -> 13428.30s]  Go to the bathroom.
[13428.38s -> 13430.86s]  Eat whatever this is.
[13436.26s -> 13438.58s]  Oh, don't clean it up, you idiot.
[13438.58s -> 13440.38s]  Grab a plate.
[13440.38s -> 13442.38s]  I got to get rid of these stupid sleeping bags.
[13445.50s -> 13446.38s]  Oh, take a shower.
[13446.38s -> 13449.30s]  I can only care about one of these people, and it's the rat werewolf guy.
[13466.30s -> 13467.90s]  Somebody that's in a good mood.
[13467.90s -> 13468.82s]  I don't know why they won't.
[13468.82s -> 13469.98s]  OK, it's not raining anymore.
[13469.98s -> 13472.22s]  So care rush.
[13479.05s -> 13490.01s]  I thought that was a beaver.
[13490.01s -> 13498.95s]  Please, somebody brush this animal brush.
[13504.51s -> 13508.11s]  Holy shit, it took you forever to figure that out.
[13512.17s -> 13514.90s]  All right. Now it's time for you to go out.
[13514.90s -> 13515.78s]  I want to go do something.
[13515.78s -> 13519.65s]  I don't want to sit here and chase around a horse.
[13519.65s -> 13522.70s]  Sunset institution of modern art.
[13522.70s -> 13525.50s]  The beach. Yes.
[13525.50s -> 13530.26s]  Is it old pier beach with?
[13530.26s -> 13540.18s]  Let's all go. Why not?
[13540.18s -> 13542.58s]  The sleeping bag causes it aching back.
[13542.58s -> 13543.38s]  All right, we all get.
[13543.38s -> 13547.58s]  How do you how does the horse get there?
[13547.58s -> 13556.77s]  The cat doesn't get a taxi, right?
[13556.77s -> 13561.29s]  So many people can't fit in here.
[13561.29s -> 13562.57s]  What about the horse?
[13562.57s -> 13572.30s]  You can't just leave the horse.
[13572.30s -> 13582.35s]  I guess this is exercise.
[13582.35s -> 13588.22s]  OK, well, we waiting for you.
[13588.22s -> 13589.70s]  Well, it's at the beach today.
[13589.70s -> 13597.02s]  Anybody have any friends?
[13597.02s -> 13600.74s]  Should I call somebody else to come hang out here?
[13600.74s -> 13617.54s]  There's nobody here.
[13617.54s -> 13627.82s]  Are we all going in?
[13627.82s -> 13630.90s]  Watch out swimming into a riptide.
[13630.90s -> 13647.54s]  I don't think that's what's happening.
[13647.54s -> 13649.14s]  What's wrong with you? What are you doing?
[13649.95s -> 13653.07s]  What? You can stand on the ground.
[13653.07s -> 13654.39s]  Can I help him?
[13654.39s -> 13662.99s]  What if he's stuck swimming stuck?
[13662.99s -> 13664.45s]  No, he's all right.
[13664.45s -> 13676.00s]  It was weird and lost weight.
[13676.00s -> 13683.70s]  Are you going out a little far?
[13683.70s -> 13685.70s]  Wait, did he lose a shitload of weight?
[13685.70s -> 13688.22s]  Look at his stomach.
[13688.22s -> 13693.38s]  Oh my God, he's actually thinner.
[13693.38s -> 13702.58s]  Where's the cat? He's going to drown.
[13702.58s -> 13707.65s]  He's not going to drown. He's fine.
[13707.65s -> 13715.02s]  Ah, beach day.
[13715.02s -> 13716.94s]  Can you play in the water?
[13716.98s -> 13727.58s]  Oh, splash.
[13727.58s -> 13740.21s]  Wait, am I going to throw a rock at him?
[13745.46s -> 13747.18s]  What is wrong with me?
[13759.31s -> 13771.44s]  A party right here.
[13771.44s -> 13774.97s]  Oh my goodness.
[13774.97s -> 13780.89s]  He lost a bunch of weight. It was him.
[13780.89s -> 13784.22s]  Don't go too far out. Come on.
[13784.22s -> 13786.17s]  Why is it so sad?
[13786.17s -> 13791.94s]  I don't think this is sad. What are you talking about?
[13791.94s -> 13795.33s]  Um, hello?
[13795.33s -> 13799.78s]  What the fuck happened to you?
[13799.78s -> 13800.66s]  Who is this?
[13800.66s -> 13802.50s]  Why do they just come ashore?
[13825.38s -> 13830.94s]  Somebody I hit was lightning?
[13830.94s -> 13838.27s]  Wait, what were they doing here?
[13838.27s -> 13844.63s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[13844.63s -> 13848.06s]  Uh-oh.
[13848.06s -> 13849.93s]  What was that?
[13849.93s -> 13852.57s]  Oh, people came.
[13852.57s -> 13857.54s]  We can make drinks and shit. Awesome.
[13857.54s -> 13864.98s]  Oh, make quick drinks. Yeah, for everybody.
[13866.10s -> 13869.10s]  That gruntail just talking to is a doctor?
[13869.10s -> 13871.10s]  Grana cough, boy.
[13871.10s -> 13873.78s]  Somebody just got burnt.
[13873.78s -> 13875.26s]  Is that what I heard?
[13889.29s -> 13891.79s]  You guys are pissing her off, I guess.
[13897.07s -> 13899.63s]  I squished his head with my thighs.
[13899.63s -> 13903.10s]  Wait.
[13906.06s -> 13913.70s]  Oh, let me thigh-crush death.
[13913.70s -> 13914.98s]  Brack neck.
[13914.98s -> 13922.37s]  Get out of the way. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[13922.37s -> 13923.93s]  Don't mourn.
[13923.93s -> 13926.29s]  I just thigh-crushed his head.
[13928.90s -> 13930.78s]  Oh, he's gone, damn it.
[13932.87s -> 13944.09s]  What? What did he do to that?
[13944.09s -> 13946.91s]  I need to see that again.
[13952.21s -> 13954.33s]  It's so stupid.
[13958.53s -> 13971.06s]  Damn it.
[13971.06s -> 13977.62s]  All right, let's have a quick drink.
[13977.62s -> 13982.30s]  Why do you keep doing that?
[13982.30s -> 14000.03s]  Who's kids is this?
[14000.03s -> 14003.65s]  All right, is it safe to drop a meteor in the ocean?
[14003.65s -> 14010.31s]  What else can I do? Hold on.
[14010.31s -> 14012.27s]  Hit somebody in the water with lightning.
[14012.27s -> 14019.03s]  I don't remember doing that.
[14019.03s -> 14021.62s]  Burn, lightning strike.
[14021.62s -> 14023.06s]  Make ugly.
[14023.06s -> 14026.62s]  Splash.
[14026.62s -> 14028.66s]  Zombify. Turn to ice.
[14040.96s -> 14045.82s]  Is he going to crush him?
[14045.82s -> 14047.42s]  React to meteor.
[14047.42s -> 14053.82s]  No.
[14053.82s -> 14058.97s]  Why is the kid looking up at the sky?
[14058.97s -> 14064.29s]  No, hold on.
[14064.29s -> 14065.69s]  Wait, if he runs over here.
[14065.69s -> 14067.66s]  Wait a minute.
[14067.66s -> 14074.48s]  Where is the meteor?
[14074.48s -> 14075.48s]  Oh, shit.
[14075.48s -> 14085.10s]  It landed in front of the meteor.
[14085.10s -> 14087.02s]  OK. OK. OK.
[14087.02s -> 14088.86s]  Wait, I saved it, right?
[14088.86s -> 14094.74s]  I thought it was going to land.
[14094.74s -> 14096.82s]  I thought. I thought.
[14096.82s -> 14099.78s]  I thought it was going to land on him over here.
[14099.78s -> 14102.73s]  And I didn't realize. OK.
[14102.73s -> 14105.25s]  OK. OK.
[14105.25s -> 14110.75s]  Well, I thought I saved it. I don't think I did.
[14110.75s -> 14115.74s]  I activated the meteor when he was in the water.
[14115.74s -> 14118.18s]  It was a soul guy over here just by himself.
[14118.18s -> 14124.53s]  I was thinking I could just drop it and see what happens in the water.
[14124.53s -> 14131.69s]  Wait, how did he get fatter?
[14131.69s -> 14143.22s]  What? Why is he fat again?
[14143.22s -> 14145.42s]  OK, everybody that's like burnt.
[14145.42s -> 14146.94s]  OK, I got to get out of here.
[14146.94s -> 14148.38s]  I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.
[14148.38s -> 14149.86s]  I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.
[14149.86s -> 14155.62s]  I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.
[14155.70s -> 14160.26s]  She's bouldering.
[14160.26s -> 14166.36s]  He's hargling, he's hargling.
[14166.36s -> 14168.36s]  OK.
[14168.36s -> 14172.21s]  Eat her, Ezealus.
[14172.21s -> 14174.45s]  Where's the horse?
[14179.04s -> 14181.44s]  He's puking. He's puking.
[14181.44s -> 14184.10s]  Wait, why is he puking?
[14184.10s -> 14186.30s]  Why is the horse puking?
[14186.30s -> 14197.30s]  What happened? Is he all right?
[14197.30s -> 14201.38s]  It was just a puke just coming out of his mouth.
[14201.38s -> 14203.30s]  Who's even in this house?
[14203.34s -> 14205.33s]  What?
[14205.33s -> 14213.82s]  Ah, OK.
[14213.82s -> 14218.17s]  Who's this?
[14218.17s -> 14223.12s]  This is a zombie.
[14227.01s -> 14229.58s]  Where's...
[14229.58s -> 14240.80s]  Wait.
[14255.01s -> 14256.21s]  I can't...
[14256.21s -> 14257.41s]  Where...
[14257.41s -> 14262.05s]  Wait, where is he?
[14267.54s -> 14272.54s]  What happened?
[14273.30s -> 14278.24s]  Where did that zombie go?
[14278.24s -> 14279.72s]  Was it an illusion?
[14288.86s -> 14290.50s]  Hey, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[14290.50s -> 14297.28s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[14297.28s -> 14298.88s]  This is the stupidest thing ever.
[14298.88s -> 14300.52s]  I hate this.
[14300.52s -> 14303.09s]  I hate this.
[14303.09s -> 14305.25s]  Give permission to ride horse?
[14308.90s -> 14310.94s]  All right, this thing has to die, right?
[14315.73s -> 14317.84s]  This is a zombie.
[14326.66s -> 14329.60s]  Still alive.
[14329.60s -> 14331.86s]  Burn it.
[14337.74s -> 14340.14s]  What is that sound?
[14340.14s -> 14346.56s]  How could a zombie have a ghost?
[14374.20s -> 14375.20s]  Why is he...
[14375.20s -> 14377.40s]  OK, you just keep fainting.
[14377.40s -> 14378.24s]  Is that...
[14378.24s -> 14380.46s]  Is he pretending?
[14380.46s -> 14387.11s]  Faint.
[14387.11s -> 14388.99s]  OK, well, that was weird.
[14388.99s -> 14390.71s]  I was going to say he ran all the way back here across...
[14390.71s -> 14391.47s]  Wait, is there a...
[14391.47s -> 14400.79s]  Where's the cat?
[14400.79s -> 14413.26s]  You have fleas.
[14413.26s -> 14414.06s]  Hold on.
[14414.06s -> 14420.90s]  Where's the other people in this?
[14420.90s -> 14431.99s]  Why'd they leave the cat?
[14432.03s -> 14434.54s]  Go home.
[14434.54s -> 14444.95s]  Come on.
[14444.95s -> 14456.08s]  Wait, who's this?
[14456.08s -> 14456.88s]  Oh, somebody lives here.
[14456.88s -> 14458.83s]  OK.
[14458.83s -> 14460.26s]  All right, go back home.
[14460.26s -> 14464.35s]  Come on.
[14464.35s -> 14464.87s]  We need you.
[14464.87s -> 14476.21s]  We need to get this cat a bath.
[14476.21s -> 14481.01s]  I think something's wrong with the horse.
[14481.01s -> 14481.41s]  Wake up.
[14481.41s -> 14485.64s]  We need to feed you and play with stuff.
[14485.64s -> 14487.10s]  Drink some water.
[14487.10s -> 14490.83s]  Have some hay.
[14490.83s -> 14492.39s]  Eat some hay.
[14492.39s -> 14495.29s]  And then play with the ball.
[14495.29s -> 14500.63s]  That's good.
[14500.63s -> 14507.89s]  There we go.
[14507.89s -> 14509.45s]  Does the horse have a TV?
[14509.45s -> 14514.76s]  There's a TV in the horse room, yeah.
[14514.76s -> 14515.44s]  OK.
[14515.44s -> 14517.64s]  Have some food and then play with the...
[14517.64s -> 14518.40s]  And then you're going to have to pee.
[14518.40s -> 14522.01s]  Where's a horse pee?
[14522.01s -> 14532.05s]  Just outside?
[14532.05s -> 14538.35s]  If you have a horse in a stable, does it just pee in the stable?
[14538.35s -> 14541.74s]  How does that work?
[14541.74s -> 14543.18s]  It just pees wherever it wants?
[14543.18s -> 14545.39s]  Yeah.
[14545.39s -> 14549.53s]  If the horse used a urinal.
[14549.53s -> 14550.45s]  Oh, it's the cat.
[14550.45s -> 14554.90s]  All right, you're back.
[14554.90s -> 14557.42s]  Some dinner.
[14557.42s -> 14571.51s]  And then get some sleep.
[14571.51s -> 14572.55s]  I still don't understand.
[14572.55s -> 14575.70s]  I'm deleting these.
[14575.70s -> 14580.62s]  This is the only person in the house that's not sleeping on the ground.
[14580.62s -> 14582.06s]  There are three full beds here.
[14582.06s -> 14585.82s]  Why are we all sleeping on the ground?
[14585.82s -> 14586.46s]  All right, yeah, yeah.
[14586.46s -> 14587.06s]  We'll do a pee break.
[14587.06s -> 14588.80s]  I'll be right back.
[14588.80s -> 14589.92s]  I'm going to go pee.
[14589.92s -> 14834.98s]  See you guys in like two minutes.
[14834.98s -> 14839.83s]  I want to get some water.
[14839.83s -> 14843.42s]  Hair all over my hand.
[14843.42s -> 14845.06s]  It's Otto.
[14845.06s -> 14851.39s]  Otto's hair.
[14851.39s -> 14859.42s]  All right.
[14859.42s -> 14863.93s]  Delicious.
[14863.93s -> 14870.06s]  Let's go.
[14870.06s -> 14871.14s]  I paused the game for a second.
[14871.14s -> 14872.82s]  What was the last thing at the beach?
[14872.82s -> 14877.29s]  I need to start going places besides just dropping meteors on people
[14877.29s -> 14879.90s]  when they're in the beach.
[14879.90s -> 14883.92s]  You know what I mean?
[14883.92s -> 14888.43s]  If I've killed like six people, we laugh out loud, killed six people.
[14888.43s -> 14889.27s]  I don't need more.
[14889.27s -> 14896.52s]  The colors are wrong.
[14896.52s -> 14898.82s]  I'm just picking up on this right now.
[14898.82s -> 14901.45s]  Why are the colors wrong?
[14901.45s -> 14905.86s]  Why is it purple?
[14905.86s -> 14913.62s]  This is supposed to be blue.
[14913.62s -> 14919.94s]  What is going on with the colors?
[14919.94s -> 14925.37s]  Why is this purple?
[14925.37s -> 14926.61s]  It's not it's blue in my game.
[14926.61s -> 14929.88s]  Why is it purple over here?
[14929.88s -> 14943.46s]  Well, that shouldn't look like that.
[14943.46s -> 14948.01s]  Pirated copy on my main monitor.
[14948.01s -> 14952.97s]  This is all blue, like blue, blue, bright blue.
[14952.97s -> 14959.18s]  This down here is not purple.
[14959.18s -> 14971.39s]  Why does it happen?
[14971.39s -> 14980.94s]  It looks a little better, but still weird.
[14980.94s -> 14990.34s]  Why is it doing this?
[14990.34s -> 14995.22s]  It's an Instagram filter.
[14995.38s -> 15003.46s]  I feel like I'm losing my mind looking over here at this.
[15003.46s -> 15009.18s]  Yeah, I don't know why it's capturing it like this.
[15009.18s -> 15012.27s]  Who cares?
[15012.27s -> 15013.43s]  I mean, I don't really necessarily care,
[15013.43s -> 15019.50s]  but that's just very weird.
[15019.50s -> 15029.62s]  It has like a purple tint on it.
[15029.62s -> 15034.17s]  Like even the road has like a purple tint.
[15034.17s -> 15035.01s]  What about morning time?
[15035.01s -> 15043.65s]  What does it look like for you guys in the morning?
[15043.65s -> 15044.89s]  It looks better this way.
[15047.60s -> 15048.44s]  Because it's night?
[15048.44s -> 15051.36s]  Well, but it's blue for me, not purple.
[15059.65s -> 15067.70s]  Somebody broke the sink.
[15067.70s -> 15068.54s]  Let's fix it.
[15080.22s -> 15081.22s]  Okay, so we're back.
[15083.04s -> 15088.20s]  But for me, yeah, you just changed back to blue.
[15088.20s -> 15089.04s]  It's not purple.
[15089.04s -> 15090.36s]  It was, that's weird.
[15090.36s -> 15093.50s]  That's very strange.
[15093.50s -> 15095.45s]  All right.
[15095.45s -> 15096.69s]  I want to take everybody today.
[15096.69s -> 15102.18s]  We're going to go over here.
[15102.18s -> 15103.06s]  I want to do something interesting.
[15103.06s -> 15106.20s]  Whose house is this?
[15106.20s -> 15110.91s]  What about like community fire department?
[15110.91s -> 15114.84s]  Wait, Central Park Summer Festival.
[15114.84s -> 15115.84s]  Why can't I?
[15115.84s -> 15116.68s]  What was it, 8 a.m.?
[15116.68s -> 15118.62s]  What time is it?
[15119.02s -> 15119.86s]  Let's go.
[15119.86s -> 15133.07s]  Hurry up.
[15133.07s -> 15137.86s]  Let's bring everybody.
[15137.86s -> 15140.18s]  Go to the festival.
[15140.18s -> 15145.11s]  Here comes a filler episode.
[15145.11s -> 15146.19s]  What can you do at the festival?
[15146.19s -> 15150.92s]  It sounds like it's going to be fun.
[15150.92s -> 15152.04s]  It's like a pie eating contest.
[15152.04s -> 15155.98s]  Oh, eating contest.
[15155.98s -> 15166.47s]  Who is, I don't even know who this person is.
[15166.47s -> 15170.92s]  No, don't go home.
[15170.92s -> 15171.76s]  All right, let's go.
[15171.76s -> 15179.98s]  Load up the car, kids.
[15179.98s -> 15181.94s]  I was just going to drop a meteor on that person's house,
[15181.94s -> 15187.32s]  but we did that joke three times, no more.
[15187.32s -> 15192.50s]  Can the horse join the eating contest?
[15192.50s -> 15196.53s]  We're going to find out.
[15196.53s -> 15202.79s]  Oh, you can play soccer?
[15202.83s -> 15207.46s]  Why can't you not going?
[15207.46s -> 15209.83s]  Why are you not going?
[15209.83s -> 15210.67s]  Don't watch TV.
[15210.67s -> 15216.46s]  Go join the festival.
[15216.46s -> 15219.74s]  Sorry, I'm not going to roundhouse kick the paper boy.
[15219.74s -> 15222.94s]  I'm sorry.
[15222.94s -> 15224.46s]  I know a lot of people are sitting there going,
[15224.46s -> 15227.46s]  oh my God, he's going to like roundhouse kick
[15227.46s -> 15229.54s]  the person that delivers the mail.
[15229.54s -> 15232.73s]  No.
[15232.73s -> 15235.00s]  Like, oh, whoops, I accidentally clicked it.
[15235.00s -> 15237.16s]  I'm not going to, no, I'm not going to do any of that.
[15237.16s -> 15238.00s]  We're going to go to the festival
[15238.00s -> 15246.68s]  and we're going to have a good time.
[15246.68s -> 15248.24s]  Oh, Grunty's doing the contest.
[15251.15s -> 15254.43s]  It's Grunty versus, who is this?
[15263.94s -> 15268.78s]  Why join the contest if you're going to do that?
[15268.78s -> 15270.38s]  Why are you even in the contest?
[15270.38s -> 15275.40s]  Why are you here?
[15275.40s -> 15277.42s]  One, two, three, go.
[15277.42s -> 15278.26s]  When do they go?
[15289.89s -> 15290.73s]  What are we waiting for?
[15290.73s -> 15291.65s]  Oh, wait, another contestant.
[15291.65s -> 15292.49s]  Okay.
[15296.04s -> 15301.97s]  Go!
[15301.97s -> 15304.33s]  Three, two, one, go!
[15314.90s -> 15316.94s]  He's going to fist his pants.
[15316.94s -> 15317.78s]  Oh, no.
[15317.78s -> 15321.17s]  Oh, no.
[15335.52s -> 15336.44s]  Oh, no, no.
[15336.44s -> 15337.28s]  Oh, no.
[15337.28s -> 15338.28s]  Oh, no.
[15338.28s -> 15339.44s]  Oh, no.
[15339.44s -> 15340.28s]  Oh, no.
[15340.28s -> 15341.30s]  Oh, no.
[15341.30s -> 15342.14s]  Oh, no.
[15342.14s -> 15342.98s]  Oh, no.
[15342.98s -> 15343.82s]  Oh, no.
[15343.82s -> 15347.07s]  Oh, no.
[15347.07s -> 15347.91s]  Oh, no.
[15347.91s -> 15350.63s]  Wait, wait, did we not complete it?
[15350.63s -> 15351.83s]  Who the fuck is this guy?
[15351.83s -> 15354.62s]  He's got like a criminal.
[15354.62s -> 15355.46s]  Oh, no.
[15355.46s -> 15356.30s]  Oh, no.
[15356.30s -> 15357.14s]  Oh, no.
[15357.14s -> 15361.86s]  Oh, no.
[15361.86s -> 15363.71s]  Oh, no.
[15363.71s -> 15369.17s]  Okay, three, two, one, go!
[15371.77s -> 15374.83s]  And they're off eating their hot dogs.
[15374.83s -> 15378.23s]  Burglar, Elephant Man, and Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank,
[15378.23s -> 15379.39s]  and Gruntilda.
[15380.47s -> 15381.79s]  Burglar gets off to a quick start,
[15381.79s -> 15383.83s]  gets three or four hot dogs down already.
[15383.83s -> 15388.14s]  He's going really fast, potentially even too fast.
[15388.14s -> 15390.06s]  Unfortunately, it looks like he's getting
[15390.06s -> 15392.86s]  a little too many hot dogs out his throat.
[15392.86s -> 15394.86s]  He seems to start choking.
[15394.86s -> 15397.83s]  Hopefully he's gonna be okay.
[15397.99s -> 15399.07s]  No, he's fine.
[15399.07s -> 15401.07s]  He's completely fine.
[15401.07s -> 15403.68s]  He just had to get it down with a little bit of water.
[15403.68s -> 15405.14s]  He's absolutely fine.
[15408.83s -> 15410.83s]  It looks like, I think he's gonna be okay.
[15417.25s -> 15419.05s]  Wait, why is he back to life?
[15419.05s -> 15421.21s]  He's still eating the hot dog.
[15421.21s -> 15423.93s]  Even after death, the burglar doesn't care.
[15423.93s -> 15425.29s]  Still wants to win this competition.
[15425.29s -> 15427.85s]  He trained for months, it seems.
[15427.85s -> 15429.17s]  Potentially years.
[15430.86s -> 15433.00s]  Even after pissing his pants, shitting his pants,
[15433.00s -> 15434.20s]  breaking his own neck and choking,
[15434.20s -> 15436.92s]  he's still gonna be doing this, he's still here.
[15436.92s -> 15439.40s]  We're gonna blame them, the winner.
[15441.25s -> 15442.81s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the hot dog eating
[15442.81s -> 15444.29s]  contest is the burglar.
[15449.86s -> 15451.26s]  Already stopped this from happening.
[15451.26s -> 15461.32s]  Stop it.
[15461.32s -> 15463.38s]  Oh, he's fine, but he's getting,
[15463.38s -> 15467.25s]  oh, all right, you're fine.
[15467.25s -> 15470.86s]  What else can we do?
[15470.86s -> 15472.18s]  Did everybody leave because they freaked out
[15472.18s -> 15478.74s]  because he was puking and stuff?
[15478.74s -> 15481.30s]  What the fuck is going on here?
[15481.30s -> 15484.86s]  What is happening?
[15484.90s -> 15486.42s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[15486.42s -> 15487.54s]  Hold on, let me get it.
[15487.54s -> 15492.57s]  Hold on, let me get it.
[15492.57s -> 15493.57s]  Hold on, where is it?
[15498.18s -> 15499.02s]  Can I even do it?
[15499.02s -> 15508.53s]  I'm not gonna be able to do this, right?
[15508.53s -> 15509.37s]  Where's he going?

[19099.92s -> 19119.36s]  I'm choosing right now. The horse is gonna bite somebody in the neck. That's just the weakest link. I don't think so

[19229.36s -> 19236.55s]  well
[19236.55s -> 19239.27s]  The difference in the Sims is if you have multiple households
[19239.95s -> 19244.23s]  They autonomously play themselves and you jump between the houses
[19244.87s -> 19247.89s]  You don't play all four or five houses at the same time

[22345.11s -> 22347.75s]  So I was supposed to play delta rune today
[22348.47s -> 22352.39s]  But I didn't and that's mainly because I didn't play delta rune chapter one
[22353.35s -> 22355.59s]  And I also kind of felt kind of shitty yesterday
[22356.95s -> 22358.15s]  but
[22358.15s -> 22366.63s]  um
[22366.63s -> 22370.42s]  Okay, here's the whole game of flu just showed up
[22374.01s -> 22377.05s]  Uh, yeah, so the plan is I still want to do delta rune
[22378.15s -> 22380.15s]  I want to play delta rune
[22380.23s -> 22382.47s]  But I need to I still want to do chapter one
[22383.58s -> 22384.70s]  so
[22384.70s -> 22387.50s]  We're not streaming tomorrow. I'm not gonna be live tomorrow
[22388.22s -> 22391.34s]  But I will be live on wednesday with delta rune
[22392.14s -> 22397.19s]  And that shop game probably and then we'll be live again on saturday with something
[22401.94s -> 22404.68s]  Rain is really loud
[22404.68s -> 22408.63s]  Are they trapped in here? What are they doing?
[22462.41s -> 22468.14s]  They just zipped away that was ridiculous. All right. Yeah, i'll see you guys on wednesday delta rune and
[22469.30s -> 22475.70s]  Uh that pawn shop game. I want to finish that was the sims 3 with a bunch of mods
[22475.94s -> 22479.37s]  The sims 4 mods are I think a little bit better
[22479.61s -> 22482.23s]  There's a lot more
[22482.23s -> 22487.37s]  Um, I think crazy things you can do in the sims 4 just because there's like there's like two or three people that have made
[22487.37s -> 22489.69s]  These like total conversion full mods, right?
[22490.63s -> 22495.98s]  But that was still a lot of fun. That was really funny. Some of the shit was just outrageous like it usually is
[22496.22s -> 22499.75s]  That was my birthday. It was great. It was really really good
[22499.99s -> 22505.21s]  So we'll see you in the middle of the week on wednesday for delta rune and then
[22506.47s -> 22515.32s]  I'll be live on saturday, too. I was hobbit day. It was great
[22515.64s -> 22524.18s]  I would have probably saturday and played a little more but
[22525.27s -> 22529.21s]  No, I once you start dropping meteors
[22529.86s -> 22532.50s]  Once you start attacking people and just killing like
[22533.06s -> 22538.02s]  It's over at that point, right?
[22538.02s -> 22542.17s]  That's why I wanted to hold off on dropping a meteor for as long as I could at least a few hours
[22544.97s -> 22547.61s]  But it didn't I dropped him on the beach. I just look at this
[22548.97s -> 22564.09s]  If you give me the toy, i'm going to play with it. You dropped a meteor five minutes in
[22566.46s -> 22573.93s]  Yeah, but then we restarted and I waited like two hours delta run delta rune one or two on wednesday, too
[22574.41s -> 22578.12s]  I already played the first one on stream a couple of years ago when it came out
[22579.27s -> 22583.59s]  But I forget everything and I don't just want to play the second one without remembering anything from the first one
[22583.83s -> 22598.54s]  So i'm going to refresh my brain on it probably play it tomorrow just off stream. Maybe tuesday, but I didn't play it
[22598.54s -> 22618.63s]  Yeah, I just didn't get around to it boys for big boys chapter two is about six to eight hours
[22618.63s -> 22631.62s]  Oh, wow, i'm looking forward to it. Thanks for the subs. There was a lot of them today, too

[22660.92s -> 22664.31s]  I don't want to read that
[22664.31s -> 22668.78s]  Secret easter egg. I'm just gonna pretend like I didn't see that
