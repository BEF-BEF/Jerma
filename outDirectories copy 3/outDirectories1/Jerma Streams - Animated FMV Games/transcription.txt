[0.76s -> 12.42s]  Good afternoon. Sorry, I am a few minutes late. I had some car trouble that I had to take care
[12.42s -> 32.25s]  of and I just finished it all. So I'm ready to go. Yeah, it's just annoying stuff. Let's just
[32.25s -> 48.49s]  leave it at that. I drive my car every day. Sometimes you run into a problem. Well, I don't
[48.49s -> 59.51s]  drive every single day, right? But, you know, on most days I drive my car. I'm the vroomer.
[62.02s -> 67.45s]  Yeah, I do this thing where I attach like a loud noise to the back of my muffler.
[69.26s -> 88.46s]  And even when I'm going like 32 miles per hour, it goes. I thought it was cool. Anyways, I hope
[88.46s -> 95.94s]  you're having a good day. Hope you're having a good start to your week here. I have been compiling
[97.69s -> 103.85s]  some FMV full motion video games for the last, I don't know, probably a few weeks.
[105.27s -> 111.77s]  And we're going to do it for the next few days. We're going to start today with the animated stuff.
[113.02s -> 119.67s]  I've actually never played Dragon's Lair ever. This is one of the most iconic classic video
[119.67s -> 128.62s]  games ever made. I've never played it ever. I've only seen I think like 12 seconds of this game's
[128.62s -> 143.38s]  animation. There's a Dragon's Lair 2. I mean, why not? There are the Space Ace. And then there's
[143.38s -> 150.65s]  another game called Kingdom. And there's another one too. There's two Kingdoms. And most of these
[150.65s -> 157.19s]  are on Steam. I didn't even know these games are on Steam. They like remade these games. And I
[157.19s -> 163.80s]  didn't even know this. So depending on how long this takes, we're just going to go through the
[163.80s -> 169.62s]  animated stuff today. And then tomorrow, I'm going to try to get the other ones to work too.
[170.98s -> 177.54s]  You will know if I ran into a bunch of technical problems later tonight into tomorrow, because
[178.50s -> 186.87s]  we'll be playing Greedfall tomorrow if I can't figure it out. But which I don't want to do,
[190.70s -> 199.24s]  because why do I not want to do that? Because Greedfall looks really great on paper.
[201.30s -> 207.86s]  But apparently it's a very slow paced game. Lots of dialogue. And you know how my attention span
[207.86s -> 213.74s]  is about... I have the attention span about a cube worth of cheese. You know what I mean?
[213.74s -> 225.93s]  That's all I got. Because I go for it and whack. Anyways, let's get started. This is Dragon's Lair.
[234.98s -> 244.55s]  Oh, I just like... I laughed at my own shitty joke and it hurt me. It's got good music. Let's
[244.55s -> 256.04s]  get the music on here so you can hear it. I have joke thorns. Yeah, but wouldn't that mean that I
[256.04s -> 272.39s]  know? And hey, Dragon's Lair, presented by John Bluth. I think this game only takes
[274.10s -> 280.71s]  like 40 minutes to beat, but it's ridiculously difficult, is what I've heard. This is a
[281.85s -> 288.63s]  make a choice within a tenth of a second and lose. So the actual video game is about 30 minutes long,
[289.27s -> 299.59s]  but it might take like three hours to do this. I don't know. I'm just setting myself up for
[301.50s -> 307.26s]  for what I think might happen. Are you ready? Are we ready for the opening cut scene?
[311.03s -> 314.71s]  Derma's not good at games either. I've never heard... I've heard of this game.
[316.41s -> 321.45s]  I've seen the mouth animations and I was like, holy shit, those are pretty good mouth animations.
[321.45s -> 339.14s]  You ready? Three. All right, start over. One. Go. Oh god. Lives. Three. Five. I can't do more than
[339.22s -> 345.21s]  five. Play the original scene order from the arcade cabinet. Dirk will start in a new scene
[345.21s -> 357.88s]  if he dies. Yeah, that's... how do I do that one? What is move beeps? Move guide? Arcade cabinet.
[357.88s -> 373.88s]  On or off? Probably off. Mode arcade. Difficulty. They're gonna keep it on hard. This mode features
[373.88s -> 380.62s]  more moves and requires quicker reactions for certain scenes. Good luck. Turn it all off. What
[380.70s -> 387.72s]  do you mean? No, I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing. I don't even know what the
[387.72s -> 391.08s]  fuck I'm doing. I'm not turning off this shit. I have no idea what's going on. All right,
[391.08s -> 403.75s]  I'm going for it. You ready? I'm not turning the move guide off. To play Dragon's Lair,
[403.75s -> 410.20s]  you'll need to make the correct move at the right time. In this scene, Dirk will fall through the
[410.20s -> 420.62s]  drawbridge. It's time to make a move. To survive... I couldn't even read that.
[422.78s -> 431.93s]  I'm dead. To play Dragon's Lair, you need to make the correct move at the right time. I'm
[431.93s -> 436.82s]  not gonna be able to beat this. In this scene, Dirk will fall through the drawbridge and you
[436.82s -> 441.06s]  have to swing the... Okay, so there's sword. Can I... Do I have to press it with my mouse?
[444.30s -> 445.82s]  Touch the sword button. Okay, yeah.
[454.94s -> 459.96s]  Come on out. You made the correct move. I did. Can I... I can't do like up, down, left, right?
[460.60s -> 464.46s]  I'm gonna misclick so many fucking times. Throughout the game, you'll need to make up,
[464.46s -> 469.58s]  down, left, right, and sword. What the fuck? Slow down. All right.
[474.42s -> 491.34s]  Why is it starting from the beginning? Okay. Jump. Okay, got that one. That one. And this one.
[500.98s -> 509.61s]  What happened? Wait, what is going on? What the fuck? I have no idea what's going on.
[509.61s -> 517.30s]  Why have I started, like, random places? Why did I start at a random place?
[519.19s -> 521.19s]  I have no idea what just happened.
[527.00s -> 533.72s]  Am I in arcade mode? Why did I... Why did I fly through the house?
[536.18s -> 543.70s]  That was fucking ridiculous. I just angry burst into the castle wall. Okay, hold on a minute.
[544.34s -> 551.10s]  New game. Three lives, move beams, move guide, arcade cabinet, arcade.
[552.78s -> 557.91s]  Dirk will start in a new scene if he dies. Okay. There we are.
[561.26s -> 568.36s]  Now this makes fucking sense. Here we go. We're doing the laser gist version. I'm ready.
[572.74s -> 578.73s]  Turn the volume down. Is it long? Okay, this part, it's the squid.
[582.87s -> 595.46s]  Okay. Then I go in the door. Here's the... This door. I made it, right? What?
[597.18s -> 604.46s]  I thought I didn't press the button. Guys, I think I might have to put this on easy.
[612.84s -> 614.44s]  Sometimes you have to press it twice. Okay.
[617.32s -> 620.76s]  So then it gets us into this room. The rocket ball. Gotta go to the right.
[620.92s -> 644.65s]  Okay. Got it. And now there's a bed. It's too fast. It's happening too fast.
[653.53s -> 657.37s]  I just keep killing them. Oh, here we go. Quickly through the door.
[659.75s -> 661.43s]  Okay, so you have to dive through. Drink me.
[661.43s -> 686.87s]  What am I doing? I can't. Don't drink. I can't take it. I can't. Let's try it again.
[688.38s -> 694.73s]  We're in the drink me room. Don't drink. Wait. Go this way. Watch out.
[694.73s -> 719.27s]  I gotta wait. Slash. No, I gotta run. Slash. Up. Slash. Right. Slash. Got it. Straight. Straight.
[719.99s -> 729.62s]  Straight. That sucks. Straight. Straight. And...
[733.24s -> 735.24s]  Over. And...
[744.12s -> 749.13s]  This is like trying to remember a dream. You know when you have a fucking nightmare
[750.01s -> 755.05s]  and during the nightmare it's completely vivid. Everything is happening in real time.
[756.09s -> 760.09s]  Right when you wake up from the nightmare, this is what it's like remembering the dream.
[764.36s -> 768.92s]  It's like, what? Then I got hit in the head with a fucking rake. And then it was lava.
[768.92s -> 773.24s]  And then I got killed and I fell down the stairs and... Wait, I forget. I kind of don't remember.
[776.25s -> 784.34s]  Get the gold. How many times do I have to go around in a circle?
[791.46s -> 805.35s]  All right. Right. Right. And straight. Right. Right. Straight. Grab.
[805.35s -> 839.72s]  I get it, I think. Okay. Door. Open door. Kill it. Kill it quick. Oh my god. This is too intense.
[846.47s -> 854.55s]  I gotta go up. This is super fast paced. It really is. It's like a thousand miles per hour.
[855.51s -> 878.23s]  All right. It's slash and then up. Go. Grab an axe. And then right. Grab the axe. Right. Straight. Down. Right.
[880.63s -> 900.38s]  Okay. Slash. Right. Down. Right. Left. Up. I did it. Okay. Holy shit.
[900.38s -> 905.48s]  Just go up the stairs.
[913.69s -> 927.98s]  Go this way. Quick. Thank god there are continues. Otherwise, I would never complete this.
[937.30s -> 943.62s]  Turn off the continues. You really want me to do that shit? Are you sure about that?
[943.62s -> 967.90s]  Up. No continues on easy. Right. And then up. Up.
[980.39s -> 983.83s]  It's too much. It's ADHD. It's like super ADHD.
[986.36s -> 989.96s]  I don't even remember the last thing I saw. It was a spider.
[992.28s -> 994.15s]  Why wouldn't the spider kill me?
[994.47s -> 1009.62s]  Use the arrow keys and space bar. Does that, does that work? Holy shit it does. Wow. Thank you.
[1010.66s -> 1020.17s]  Right. Up. And then left. Slash.
[1023.29s -> 1029.74s]  Where do I go? I'm trying. Boss fight.
[1029.74s -> 1048.33s]  Boss fight. Go. Right. Left. Up. Right. Left. Up.
[1048.33s -> 1066.57s]  Up. Left. Right. Up. Right. One hit.
[1078.78s -> 1081.74s]  The two second deaths are the funniest.
[1082.46s -> 1089.37s]  Oh shit. It's up. Down.
[1100.41s -> 1121.58s]  Which one do I go to? Which one do I go to? This is the beginning of the game.
[1127.08s -> 1132.44s]  It's the Homer Simpson. Okay. What if I continue? I don't want to continue from here.
[1132.44s -> 1162.47s]  Oh god damn it. All right. Well I should remember all this. No I don't.
[1184.26s -> 1186.58s]  I don't even feel like I'm screaming. I feel like I'm on drugs.
[1189.58s -> 1192.62s]  I make these noises during streams. That's why it's freaking me out.
[1193.67s -> 1197.98s]  I made that noise at the beginning of the stream. That was the first noise I made.
[1201.21s -> 1215.19s]  Yee boulders. I don't have a thing. Yee rapids.
[1230.66s -> 1241.38s]  Okay. Left. Right. Left. When the shower is too hot.
[1246.95s -> 1259.21s]  Now what? Back up here. Okay. Go. Come on. Where the fuck am I?
[1259.53s -> 1276.30s]  What? This is just the Sonic the Hedgehog room. From Sonic 3D Blast. Yeah, I played it.
[1278.30s -> 1297.18s]  What? I thought I was going to get in the face by one of those things.
[1298.54s -> 1319.34s]  Why did I just get scooped up by like an octopus? Hold on. This guy sucks.
[1319.50s -> 1329.14s]  This guy sucks. He's the worst. What is this guy's name? Dick Dastardly Richard.
[1336.79s -> 1363.67s]  All right. Straight. Straight. No. It's sword. Sword probably. Sword. Sword. It's sword. Sword.
[1363.67s -> 1375.75s]  Now what? Did I just get an enchantment?
[1387.35s -> 1390.71s]  I just got Dark Souls. That happens all the time.
[1391.91s -> 1405.88s]  You opened up a chest. I got a new weapon. Okay. Here we go. Got it. How many rooms are there?
[1408.31s -> 1408.87s]  Don't drink it.
[1416.12s -> 1417.40s]  Got it. Made it to the puke room.
[1427.77s -> 1435.29s]  This game is fucking wonderful. What a wonderful game.
[1448.26s -> 1454.20s]  Imagine doing this all in... Yeah. I can't imagine doing this all in one sitting with one quarter.
[1454.20s -> 1461.83s]  Without the guide? You know what? I'm turning the guide off. No. Wait, wait, wait. I'm turning
[1461.83s -> 1479.64s]  the guide off. I think it's time. I understand the game now. I'm going for it. Move guide off.
[1480.54s -> 1488.12s]  Move beeps. I'm going to keep move beeps on. We're going to put it on easy.
[1492.39s -> 1502.41s]  Easy. Move guide off. I'm going for it. What does arcade cabinet mean? Hey, I'm going to do five
[1502.41s -> 1522.02s]  lives. No. This infinity continues. Five lives? It's just a border. Okay. I think that's fine.
[1522.74s -> 1527.62s]  I'm ready. Let's go. I'm doing it. Let's do it. I get it. I understand how the game works.
[1527.62s -> 1544.06s]  Oh, fuck. That doesn't tell me when I do them either. Okay. Let me go straight.
[1545.58s -> 1560.54s]  Right. Now we go right. Right twice. Okay. We're going to go left. Left. Got it. What?
[1565.06s -> 1599.13s]  Uh oh. So what happened? What's going on here? What? It's not left. Go. Go. Okay. Got it. Get the
[1599.13s -> 1616.12s]  fucking mouse off the screen. Don't drink that. It's all right. Let's go. Let's do it. Continue.
[1616.84s -> 1622.20s]  I got infinite continues. I got infinite money. I brought right to my right is a sack of quarters.
[1622.20s -> 1630.81s]  There's like 60 bucks in the quarters over here. Forward. Forward. No, it's forward slash.
[1635.43s -> 1650.34s]  Let's forward. Forward again. Shit. No, it's slash. Forward slash. Forward slash.
[1650.34s -> 1652.34s]  Slash. Got it.
[1661.30s -> 1675.64s]  Just through the door. Hey, mister, can you get off me? My friends want to play. How old are you
[1675.64s -> 1717.37s]  anyway? 34. Hey, I have every right to be here just like you do. Forward. What? Slash. Left. Yep.
[1717.37s -> 1726.70s]  It's left. Flash. Forward. Good. Okay. Now we're going to go
[1730.76s -> 1741.13s]  again. Forward. All right. Sonic the Hedgehog room. I remember this. Down. Down again.
[1748.28s -> 1772.87s]  What? That was bullshit. All right. Wait. Now go. What the fuck?
[1778.60s -> 1781.75s]  What? It might be left or right then.
[1784.31s -> 1797.00s]  What? It's not left. It's not down. It's not right. Which one is it? Is it jump?
[1798.90s -> 1802.84s]  I'm doing too early. Well, he gets killed in the animation.
[1807.05s -> 1816.55s]  I mean, the timing is here. Now. Now. See? What the fuck?
[1816.95s -> 1836.74s]  Three. Four. I, it's not down. I think it's left.
[1838.90s -> 1845.77s]  It's left. All right. I need, I gotta make something real clear. The ding,
[1846.73s -> 1854.98s]  guys, is when I'm pressing the button at the right time. You understand? Do you understand?
[1855.06s -> 1888.74s]  Okay. Good. Left. What? No, come on. What the fuck? No. I had it. It's not, it's not the ding.
[1889.88s -> 1894.86s]  Hey, it's not the ding. God. Okay. I'm going to lose it forever.
[1904.02s -> 1909.66s]  Just do the ding. Dude, you have to press it when it dings.
[1910.62s -> 1940.31s]  I'm the one creating the dings. I did it. I didn't do anything. Slash right. Now it's left.
[1941.27s -> 1972.54s]  It's right when the scene transitions. And then down. Shit. It's up. Down and up. Slashing.
[1973.18s -> 1981.94s]  Um, wait. Now. Slash again. And then right, left. And then.
[1981.94s -> 2001.83s]  Do I lose points for fucking it up? And up. And then we have to wait. I do the thing and then here
[2001.83s -> 2022.57s]  it comes. I don't remember this one. It's the sludge. This two of these games, by the way,
[2022.57s -> 2042.49s]  if you didn't know. It's probably left. Left. Up. And then. Right. No. Okay. I have to kill that
[2042.49s -> 2057.59s]  thing. It's immediately the right. Yeah. This wasn't the arcade. I miss this kind of shit. I
[2057.59s -> 2073.13s]  really do. No. No. So it's up slash down. I think it's probably done. This stuff,
[2073.13s -> 2075.53s]  this is just so goofy. This shit's so stupid. I love it.
[2075.53s -> 2093.46s]  Oh shit. And then right. But was it 50 cents? Was it a quarter? How many lives did you get?
[2096.34s -> 2101.59s]  Well, somebody will count how many times I've died and we can count by 50 cents.
[2101.59s -> 2122.95s]  Shit. I have to move. I miss being cheated out of my money. No. Yeah. Damn. And then.
[2129.00s -> 2149.02s]  Why does he stop pursuing me? Got it. It's forward into the pool, right? From what I remember.
[2149.02s -> 2176.26s]  It's left. What? It is left. Oh, it's because this is different. It's mirrored. It was on
[2176.26s -> 2201.67s]  the right side last time. Okay. So you don't jump. Is it not a jump over? I've tried jumping over
[2201.67s -> 2218.79s]  twice. There's such a long line of kids behind you. Excuse me, manager. There's a guy over at
[2218.79s -> 2249.67s]  the dragon's lair machine and he smells. Out. Forward. I had it. Shit. And left. And then
[2249.67s -> 2258.68s]  forward. Yup. Forward. I just watched it happen.
[2269.14s -> 2282.54s]  And then it's forward again. Slash. Forward. A boss fight. Oh, this is going to be hell.
[2283.58s -> 2300.70s]  This is going to be absolute hell without the guy. I think it's up.
[2311.40s -> 2312.36s]  No, it's left.
[2321.18s -> 2323.90s]  Oh, okay. You gotta wait. It's left and then right.
[2327.62s -> 2330.02s]  Sir, the arcade's closing for the day. Can you please leave?
[2335.93s -> 2339.21s]  I'll give him a handshake. And there's a hundred dollar bill in my hand.
[2339.21s -> 2342.81s]  I got to wait for the night. It's got to leave one of these lights on.
[2356.22s -> 2362.01s]  Left, right, it is up, I think. Left, right, up, down.
[2372.23s -> 2382.33s]  Left, right, up, down. Shit. Okay, it's left, right, left, right, up, left, left, right, up.
[2382.57s -> 2393.82s]  Right. Right, up, right.
[2403.08s -> 2409.13s]  And then left, left, and then down, up. It's too much.
[2416.73s -> 2420.97s]  Oh my god. I can't. All right, I got it. I got it. I'll be good.
[2421.77s -> 2423.21s]  Left, right, up.
[2432.23s -> 2434.63s]  Oh, it's up.
[2452.26s -> 2458.63s]  I just pressed right. You got this little window to do it. God damn it.
[2458.63s -> 2467.48s]  Oh my god, you can't spam it. Somebody said spam the directions. You can't.
[2475.29s -> 2488.17s]  Kill him. I'm good.
[2498.68s -> 2507.59s]  It's right. I think it's back.
[2507.59s -> 2531.75s]  Oh, that's not left. How is it not left? You have to jump over, right?
[2533.91s -> 2539.94s]  Too early? I can't just jump in there?
[2542.81s -> 2548.04s]  Okay, it's down. I thought I tried down.
[2551.50s -> 2575.56s]  What the fuck? I, okay, I remember this part. Go forward. I remember this room. Oh, this is bad.
[2580.52s -> 2591.38s]  Shit, I had it too. Oh well.
[2596.90s -> 2609.53s]  You gotta watch the fire comes up. Did I do it? I did it. All right, new content.
[2611.67s -> 2623.42s]  Oh, you asshole. It's right. How am I up here? Wait, how did I get back to this room?
[2623.90s -> 2635.14s]  Is it the elevator? It just goes in a random order. Oh, okay.
[2638.98s -> 2656.82s]  Get out. Okay, then now we're down the elevator again. Forward.
[2665.62s -> 2684.34s]  I just tried to go up. It's up. I, I'm, ah.
[2691.50s -> 2693.66s]  Somebody count. I want to know how much money I've spent here.
[2698.84s -> 2718.87s]  I, oh no, not this shit. I have to, oh my god, this is gonna be hell. This is gonna be horrible.
[2719.83s -> 2735.14s]  Remember, this was like slash, run, run, run, slash. Left.
[2741.78s -> 2747.64s]  So it's mirrored from last time. So it's left. It's, I think it's left over and over again.
[2748.81s -> 2768.76s]  Left again. Huh? What?
[2781.42s -> 2801.35s]  God, I didn't even have a chance to see where the sword was going. Right again. And then left.
[2815.32s -> 2826.58s]  Right again. Right. Okay, then it's right again. And then it's right. Left. Right. Right.
[2826.58s -> 2838.39s]  Right. Grab. Swing. Holy shit. There was a left and a right in there, guys, and I fucking
[2838.39s -> 2854.18s]  guessed wildly and I got it. That was not just space. That was left and. I have to do this shit
[2854.18s -> 2860.84s]  again. Just on the other, it's a mirror against the screen. Does the game end? I don't know if
[2860.84s -> 2882.94s]  the game ever ends. And then it's right. I don't know how to use the elevator.
[2883.66s -> 2895.18s]  I, where am I supposed to be going in the elevator? Is it, is it not left or right?
[2895.82s -> 2921.03s]  It should be right. Isn't it just mirrored? Maybe it's forward. I've tried up, left and right on the
[2921.03s -> 2942.36s]  envelope. What the fuck? It'll punish you for doing things too early. That's the only frames I have
[2942.84s -> 2963.64s]  there. Watch, ready? Maybe wait till it gets up. Oh, all right. And then, oh yeah, okay, the statue.
[2965.80s -> 2981.88s]  Now what? These guys died so many times. It's, okay, it's slash and then right up the stairs.
[2984.31s -> 2987.67s]  Right now? What? No, it's up to the axe.
[2997.30s -> 3005.37s]  Shit. Okay, it's up and then right. I thought it was up and then slash.
[3005.37s -> 3025.50s]  And then in. Oh shit, no, it's down. You have to go all the way around and then up the stairs.
[3033.85s -> 3048.82s]  And then over. Go, hurry up, go. What are you doing? Press this. So on the stairs,
[3048.82s -> 3070.28s]  why do I have to jump to the left? Because it's not slash. I don't remember. And then up and then
[3070.28s -> 3091.93s]  go left. Yep, and then up and then up. Okay, good. Oh shit, I have to fight. All right,
[3091.93s -> 3102.60s]  I gotta fight him. Slash and I think it's run. Got it, go. Up, again, okay. Now,
[3102.60s -> 3120.30s]  I think it's another elevator. See? Up. Okay, so it's two ups. Three ups.
[3121.50s -> 3147.32s]  We should go right. Landing yet. He wasn't even done landing. Dude, so it's a double tap. You're
[3147.32s -> 3173.48s]  gonna go up, up. And then again, it's bats. Slash or maybe duck, I wonder. And it's probably slash.
[3174.20s -> 3188.04s]  The bats coming. Yep, slash, right, right again. Go. Bats, right, slash, left. It's probably
[3189.32s -> 3209.80s]  slash. It's slash. And then it's left. And then we go. What is that? What's? Oh, god damn it.
[3212.97s -> 3218.06s]  So that's also a slash. Or it might be a, you might have to run back up the stairs.
[3218.06s -> 3246.71s]  Jump, slash, left. Got it. Oh boy, here we go. I have no idea what happened. I'm gonna say jump
[3246.71s -> 3278.78s]  or slash. Probably forward, right? Or right? I don't know when to do this. So it's definitely
[3278.78s -> 3300.52s]  slash when I turn around. So that doesn't work. So try the swing. Maybe try swinging twice before
[3300.52s -> 3318.06s]  it falls? We'll probably jump. Oh, come on. That window is so tiny.
[3328.22s -> 3334.46s]  I probably have to run down or right after the sword.
[3334.46s -> 3342.54s]  No, it's not down.
[3360.84s -> 3365.72s]  Too early. They, when it goes, that's your, that's where they kill you.
[3365.96s -> 3382.90s]  So, swing twice? Because you get surrounded. How the fuck do I get away from that?
[3393.30s -> 3404.54s]  Jump. What the fuck? Forward, I, it's up. It's up. I have to go. So when they get in front of you,
[3404.54s -> 3419.46s]  you go up and then up again? Or do I go down? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[3419.46s -> 3423.54s]  When they get in front of you, you go up and then up again? Or left? Oh god, this is gonna be fucking
[3423.54s -> 3446.47s]  horrible. The new cuphead looks hard. Maybe it's left. Yeah, it looks left.
[3459.80s -> 3466.79s]  Damn it. Did I beat cuphead? Yeah, I did. I beat that like the first day it came out.
[3467.35s -> 3483.21s]  Damn. Where do I go? I just want to, I want to screenshot that area.
[3501.11s -> 3509.85s]  Is it, I, I tried right. I tried left. Maybe I should try down.
[3519.77s -> 3530.34s]  Down doesn't do anything. It looks like left is the waterfall, but then I go in the waterfall and
[3530.34s -> 3539.27s]  it kills me. So I'm not, I need to know where to go and the right exact moment to press the button.
[3546.01s -> 3557.30s]  Nope. Too bad I don't have a sword. The sword doesn't work.
[3562.66s -> 3571.62s]  All right, up. Okay. It's up again. It's right. It's left. Holy shit. Okay, my god. It's up,
[3571.62s -> 3587.24s]  it's right, and then it's left. But you have to do it at the exact moment. No.
[3591.48s -> 3595.88s]  Is it up again? I think it might be up again. It's not left. Oh my god, this place sucks.
[3597.00s -> 3612.42s]  It's up and I, why is that?
[3618.17s -> 3619.61s]  Oh, come on. I swung.
[3628.47s -> 3644.07s]  I'm probably so close to the end. I have to beat it. I just pressed it. I just pressed it.
[3644.07s -> 3660.79s]  Oh my god. Do I have to wait another like tenth of a second before I can press it?
[3662.78s -> 3679.45s]  Oh my, no, that's it. I didn't press anything. He just died. I gotta go earlier than that.
[3683.22s -> 3689.86s]  Yeah, it's earlier than that. And then up and then left. I don't fucking know.
[3689.86s -> 3718.17s]  No. I'm gonna wait. Maybe it's up again. No, but wouldn't up just go right into the lava?
[3727.37s -> 3732.04s]  I feel like that would just jump in the lava.
[3745.45s -> 3755.50s]  Got it. Come on. Again. It's again. Okay. No, I don't know what it would have meant.
[3755.58s -> 3766.39s]  Is it swing? It's definitely not swing because I can't kill them.
[3778.89s -> 3789.26s]  Up again. It's up again. I did it. Oh no, what am I doing in the elevator? What am I doing in
[3789.26s -> 3800.06s]  the elevator? So stop what? Stop like. What's the elevator tactic? Wait for two. Wait for one.
[3801.64s -> 3818.76s]  One, two. I'm just going with two. No, no, no, I don't want to. What the fuck?
[3828.15s -> 3837.69s]  What to do? Oh, this is new.
[3837.69s -> 3855.16s]  Okay, this is he boulders. Now you have to dodge the boulders. You gotta do it much quicker than
[3855.16s -> 3885.85s]  that. This is a long string too. Rapids. This is fucking bad. I'm gonna fucking start this
[3885.85s -> 3892.63s]  section over like 25 times, I think, man. Because that first one was up.
[3892.63s -> 3915.56s]  Up and then left. Left. Up. Left. Okay. Okay, whirlwinds. This is right. Just gotta avoid
[3915.56s -> 3929.42s]  the whirlwinds. Fuck, I must have screwed it up. All right, that's it. Oh, I forgot to grab the
[3929.42s -> 3958.15s]  chain. All right, I'm good. Now what? I think I have to duck or go to the right. No, right is
[3958.15s -> 3980.54s]  spikes. Left. You have to dodge right. It says right. It's left. Whatever the fuck it is.
[3991.83s -> 3993.59s]  You gotta do really early for that third one.
[4015.29s -> 4025.91s]  First try at that one. All right, save me. I'm going. Did I grab the diamond?
[4029.77s -> 4042.70s]  This is a new room. All right, slash twice. Yep. It's slash, slash it.
[4043.34s -> 4058.14s]  Shit, then it's up. How am I keeping up with what's happening? Well, the answer is no.
[4059.98s -> 4067.64s]  I know that wasn't a yes or no question, but it was. Kind of. Now what?
[4068.04s -> 4078.82s]  Hmm. Into the hole. Slash the hole. Watch out.
[4084.60s -> 4108.15s]  And get out. Nice. No, not this again. Twice and then right. Slash the spider. Get in. Okay.
[4109.03s -> 4123.74s]  Yep. It was up and I fucked it up.
[4147.24s -> 4153.56s]  Oh my god. I hate this room because I know what it is, but it's flipped. I memorized it from last
[4153.56s -> 4183.98s]  time. I did it. I pressed it. I pressed up. Fucking 30 rocks down. I did.
[4183.98s -> 4197.37s]  What?
[4211.90s -> 4251.37s]  Fuck you. I made it to throne room. Okay, right up. Sir, we just got a notification
[4251.37s -> 4261.58s]  that you just took out $100,000 to beat Dragon's Lair. Well, it's all right. I'm going to be able
[4261.58s -> 4277.43s]  to pay that back because this shit ain't going to take more than $75. Right. What was that?
[4277.43s -> 4295.72s]  Did you hear that noise? I beat it. It's the end. The dragon. Swing.
[4301.37s -> 4308.55s]  I think it's swing.
[4316.62s -> 4326.17s]  Am I doing that to the dragon? I'll do right instead.
[4326.89s -> 4332.52s]  No. I tried left. I tried up.
[4337.46s -> 4346.50s]  Maybe down. I'm trying to make, no, no, I don't want to swing. It's not up.
[4349.94s -> 4363.18s]  It's not left. It's not up. I'm going to try down. It's not down. It is left. What? I pressed left
[4363.18s -> 4379.51s]  so many times. What the fuck? Okay. Ready? Left. Left. What the? What? I did that like three times.
[4380.23s -> 4413.99s]  We killed us both. Left and then up. I don't know. He's back. He went back to sleep.
[4415.67s -> 4420.25s]  Did I break the glass?
[4420.57s -> 4427.45s]  Save me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[4427.45s -> 4431.61s]  This is freaking me out. To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[4432.81s -> 4442.74s]  Please tell me I can start from there. Oh, fuck me.
[4446.41s -> 4451.93s]  I think I have to, I don't know where to go.
[4456.65s -> 4463.98s]  Okay. It's so tall. Then watch out for the thing, the plates that fall.
[4466.06s -> 4476.78s]  And it's the over-animated, scary faces. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps
[4476.78s -> 4480.70s]  it around his neck. I wonder if it's down. I think it's probably down. To slay the dragon,
[4480.70s -> 4490.15s]  use the magic sword. I'm going to try down because where do I go? Down. It's down. It's down.
[4492.39s -> 4498.90s]  Left. I don't know. Right. Down. I don't know. It's down again.
[4500.34s -> 4504.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[4515.05s -> 4516.73s]  Tell me about how to kill the dragon again.
[4523.62s -> 4528.17s]  This was video gaming at one point. Oh yeah. I know everybody loved it.
[4528.17s -> 4537.26s]  Please save me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[4538.14s -> 4541.66s]  To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[4544.38s -> 4548.57s]  It's down. Right here. And then it's left.
[4553.45s -> 4573.66s]  It's not. It's down again. Yep. And then. I don't know. It's probably up. It's either up or right.
[4577.18s -> 4581.10s]  Yeah, it's funny. Look, these things happen in a tenth of a second.
[4581.10s -> 4588.23s]  Look, you know how much money people used to spend on this shit? I used to go into
[4588.23s -> 4592.71s]  arcades back in the fucking early nineties and the screen would be broken. And I would
[4592.71s -> 4595.83s]  always go up to the machine and be like, I want to try that. Why is the, the, the monitor,
[4595.83s -> 4619.62s]  the screen is broken. It's because somebody like, I, okay, I got it. I'll get it this time.
[4621.75s -> 4626.14s]  It's down. Hey, you guys ready for that monologue again?
[4626.14s -> 4638.36s]  Please save me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[4639.40s -> 4642.76s]  To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[4643.72s -> 4651.18s]  I don't, I still don't have that memorized. It's down twice. And then it's right.
[4651.42s -> 4683.48s]  Now what? No, it was too fast. I tried to swing. I tried to swing too early. I just figured.
[4683.48s -> 4699.94s]  God, whatever. Dirk definitely Richard. He saved me. The cage is locked with the key.
[4701.26s -> 4708.06s]  The dragon keeps it around his neck. To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[4708.94s -> 4712.46s]  To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[4715.21s -> 4716.01s]  Okay.
[4725.02s -> 4725.52s]  Again.
[4728.38s -> 4745.21s]  I did, I did, he just dies. He just dies. There's no that. I didn't, he just dies.
[4746.57s -> 4750.57s]  She just dies. I have to go left or down or something. I have to grab it and jump backwards.
[4751.37s -> 4765.50s]  I, I think you grab the sword and hit down. I'm so close. It's down. It has to be.
[4766.46s -> 4781.13s]  Why am I looking? I'm literally reading chat right now. On a game you have a tenth of a second to press a button.
[4781.13s -> 4783.13s]  What the fuck am I thinking?
[4802.62s -> 4806.62s]  Please save me. Stop making me read the chat with your funny copy plaster.
[4806.62s -> 4815.96s]  He saved me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[4816.92s -> 4820.36s]  To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[4822.79s -> 4827.62s]  I think I'm gonna try down. I'm gonna grab sword and then press down.
[4828.58s -> 4863.11s]  Should I just not press anything? Maybe I just shouldn't press any buttons. I don't know.
[4869.38s -> 4877.13s]  If I don't press a button, does it just do it? I don't have to swing the sword. But do I? I have no idea.
[4877.13s -> 4897.45s]  Please save me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[4898.41s -> 4901.85s]  To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
[4913.82s -> 4915.66s]  All right, I'll get it this time. I'm not gonna press anything.
[4916.54s -> 4930.62s]  Here we go. Don't touch anything. I'm dead.
[4935.67s -> 4940.36s]  That's all you guys saying. I was doing it too early. I didn't press any buttons at all.
[4947.96s -> 4955.34s]  So maybe I have to press it right when I touch it. Don't go for the sword. What?
[4961.16s -> 4967.64s]  I know I've pressed the sword button. You got like this. There's only one window where you
[4967.64s -> 4980.55s]  can press this button and it's like seven frames, six frames long. Maybe even less than that.
[4986.54s -> 5008.63s]  I fucking pressed it. This game is 60 in FPS. Yeah, so it's even smaller than what you think.
[5008.63s -> 5011.43s]  It's like two. It's one frame per. It's one or two frames.
[5013.35s -> 5018.82s]  I'm gonna try to grab. I'm gonna try to hit the sword right when I go up to grab the sword.
[5018.90s -> 5026.02s]  Let's see if that does it like right. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around
[5026.02s -> 5042.44s]  his neck to slay the dragon. Use the magic sword. Did I press it? I'm gonna go for right when I grab
[5042.44s -> 5060.18s]  the sword right when I touch it. Space. I'm like going in space. Here we go. There's no that. No,
[5060.66s -> 5064.82s]  there is no inputs. There are no inputs. That's wrong. I'm not going for the sword. I'm not gonna
[5064.82s -> 5071.45s]  grab it. There are no inputs. You can't do an input there. No inputs. There's no inputs.
[5072.09s -> 5092.49s]  I'm not gonna touch the sword. But what the fuck do I do? He saved me. The cage is locked
[5092.49s -> 5100.57s]  with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon. Use the magic sword.
[5101.29s -> 5105.29s]  There isn't any room for me to grab the sword. Otherwise, the error sounds in play. Yeah,
[5105.29s -> 5110.81s]  that's what I mean. So it's something before you grab the sword. Maybe space bright or like the
[5110.81s -> 5115.21s]  different input or button press or another input or button press. I just said the same thing twice.
[5115.77s -> 5120.17s]  Holy shit. My brain just went backwards. I rewound. I'll fall a second. My brain.
[5120.17s -> 5134.74s]  Wow. The stream skipped. No, it was me.
[5141.32s -> 5145.56s]  So should I press space right before that transition to get the sword or should I hit
[5145.56s -> 5151.96s]  like a different right or down or left? I don't know. He saved me. The cage is locked
[5151.96s -> 5160.04s]  with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon. Use the magic sword.
[5160.92s -> 5170.09s]  All right, let's see what happens. I'm gonna try to do sword right before I go grab it.
[5174.94s -> 5199.16s]  There we go. Did it. I did it. Now what? I don't know. It's sword twice.
[5199.96s -> 5204.44s]  It's sword and then sword to block and then god if I know.
[5212.22s -> 5218.46s]  So it's sword right before you touch it. Sword again to block and then I have to move.
[5233.34s -> 5240.46s]  He saved me. The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck.
[5241.10s -> 5245.42s]  It's up after. Somebody said left and somebody said up. I don't know what to believe.
[5246.06s -> 5247.77s]  I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try up.
[5261.21s -> 5278.28s]  Left Jeremy. You're all saying different shit. Okay. Left. Right.
[5280.66s -> 5297.06s]  I don't know. It's more. It's left and then I have no idea. Left and then up maybe.
[5297.06s -> 5316.55s]  I did left and then right and it's wrong. He saved me. The cage is locked with the key.
[5317.27s -> 5322.87s]  The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon. He spent all your allowance on this shit.
[5322.95s -> 5330.71s]  Magic sword. Yeah I'm happy I did. No guides by the way. I don't need guides.
[5339.22s -> 5353.38s]  Again. This is it. Left.
[5357.59s -> 5377.77s]  It's space. Oh I did it. What do I do? Grab it. Up. Don't touch anything. What? Did she
[5377.77s -> 5401.94s]  say? I said I would. That's it. That's the end of the game. I win. Watch the.
[5402.66s -> 5409.82s]  The next draw we're going to do has two characters in it and the two. I get to draw Dirk.
[5409.82s -> 5416.46s]  And the dragon singe. Now Dirk is a little tiny character and dragon is a big character. Okay.
[5416.46s -> 5420.46s]  So what I'm going to do to cheat this a little bit is I'll pull Dirk into the foreground so
[5420.46s -> 5427.02s]  that he stays kind of big and push the dragon to the background. And I think just to get this
[5427.02s -> 5434.86s]  thing to work I'm going to sketch out how I can do this. This dragon is sort of working with Dirk
[5434.86s -> 5446.10s]  like that and I can bring all the tail up around like this. I have to concentrate while I draw.
[5446.10s -> 5460.82s]  Sorry. So the dragon. What I just told you I think is really relevant here. What's the dragon doing?
[5460.82s -> 5474.78s]  Is he excited? Is he angry? Does he. Oh that's probably like a 40 minute video.
[5475.58s -> 5479.10s]  I don't want to. Why did I skip that? Because that's probably that's going to that's like a
[5479.10s -> 5490.18s]  28 minute video. I was watching that. Well let's go look go look up draw dick on oh draw Dirk on
[5490.18s -> 5508.62s]  YouTube. All right that's that one. We're just getting started. I got dragon's lair two. I've
[5508.62s -> 5512.78s]  also got space ace. I've also let's let's do let's get away from dragon's lair. Let's try this one.
[5513.26s -> 5516.78s]  Now this one is really old and has not been remastered.
[5517.58s -> 5529.56s]  So it looks like dog shit. So we're gonna try this one. I hope it opens. I don't this doesn't
[5529.56s -> 5539.83s]  even have a thing on steam I don't think. I don't know if I'm gonna beat this one. I really doubt
[5539.83s -> 5552.98s]  that I'm going to because it's so crunchy. It's kingdom the far reaches. This is a crunchy fucking
[5552.98s -> 5572.84s]  game. So let me get this right. It should. Okay hopefully this fucking opens. Oh god I can't even
[5572.84s -> 5585.42s]  fucking see. All right hold on hold on hold on. No that's my that's a command prompt. There it is.
[5587.10s -> 5598.36s]  There it is. Oh yeah it didn't even take me five seconds. I got it. I got it immediately.
[5600.23s -> 5612.15s]  It was ready to go. Let's do it. You can still see right? Everyone can see perfectly fine.
[5615.38s -> 5625.86s]  This is a crusty fucking game. Just need to be very aware of that. Virtual image productions
[5625.86s -> 5634.98s]  presents the far reaches. Kingdom the far reaches. Start apprentice start wizard.
[5636.10s -> 5638.82s]  I think this is difficulties. I don't know if I want to do start as a wizard.
[5646.70s -> 5679.66s]  Wizard. No I ain't doing that. The history. The he-man. The time of the arched kings is
[5679.66s -> 5685.40s]  past. You my old friend are the last of your races. This is fucking crunchy. Farewell.
[5686.12s -> 5706.50s]  All right so that's an evil wizard. There is one in time destroyed. What was that?
[5707.38s -> 5710.50s]  Oh shit man. He like burped out his true form for a second.
[5713.38s -> 5719.80s]  So the high race of the arched kings passed from the world destroyed by twisted.
[5719.80s -> 5735.40s]  The wisest and most powerful was our leader Morbus. This amulet is called the hand.
[5735.40s -> 5740.92s]  That's a huge fucking amulet. The most powerful magic could be focused.
[5742.84s -> 5746.44s]  Grandpa are you sure you didn't just spray paint a hubcap fucking gold.
[5746.44s -> 5751.86s]  Creating the five relics from the amulet. It's a piece of pineapple.
[5754.22s -> 5758.94s]  The last of the bloodline of the arched kings would come to challenge the might of torlok.
[5761.61s -> 5769.54s]  Morbus is gone but the one who will come remains. I am ready. Torlok is searching for
[5769.54s -> 5779.46s]  the relics and for you. His power grows while the old magic fades. Try me. I will find the
[5779.46s -> 5785.46s]  relics and rejoin them to make the hand of Morbus. I have tried 22 apprentices over the years and
[5785.46s -> 5791.54s]  they have all died but they were not of the race of the arched kings. That's that's that's
[5791.54s -> 5798.38s]  that means you're a bad teacher right? You've had 22 apprentices and they've all died.
[5799.50s -> 5803.42s]  I think that that's on you. That means you're not doing good enough like magicians teaching.
[5804.14s -> 5811.85s]  All right I'm gonna turn it up. Somebody said it's not loud enough. That should be good.
[5812.73s -> 5820.01s]  All right I'm gonna I'm not starting as a wizard. You guys serious? That's not gonna happen.
[5820.65s -> 5837.35s]  I'm doing apprentice. Have you already seen this? I just did that. It was me.
[5838.63s -> 5845.98s]  By the way this is a DVD game. You could I was actually gonna put this on a tv and play it.
[5851.86s -> 5856.10s]  Game on. What's wrong? Lathan a terrible thing has happened.
[5858.02s -> 5864.98s]  Drake's blood the wicked has imprisoned the rightful ruler and claimed the throne. You must find the
[5864.98s -> 5870.66s]  relics, the black mace, the hunting horn, and the orb of Morbus to defeat Drake's blood.
[5871.38s -> 5876.82s]  Hurry to my mansion. I am preparing scrolls to help you on your journey. The kingdoms are
[5876.82s -> 5885.50s]  counting on you. This reminds me of like that old bible animation. Last hope to find the relics of
[5885.50s -> 5893.98s]  Morbus and renew the magic that grows old as I do. But until you hold the relics be cautious
[5893.98s -> 5903.26s]  in your use of magic. I understand Daylon. I have finished new scrolls for you. Scrolls? I give you
[5903.26s -> 5909.98s]  three scrolls inscribed with spells of seeing. They bring sight to the blind and show those with
[5909.98s -> 5918.22s]  vision that which is hidden. Okay you got me a backpack with three magical scrolls. Now which
[5918.22s -> 5926.87s]  scrolls should I work on next? Which scrolls should you work on? Spell of understanding, spell of
[5926.87s -> 5946.65s]  release, spell of traveling. Spell of release? Now choose which of Glendale where once you lived

[5952.89s -> 5955.05s]  haunted waterfalls.
[5967.02s -> 5971.66s]  I have no idea what the fuck any of these people just said. I what did you say?
[5973.94s -> 5995.67s]  Uh scroll of seeing. Uh okay I don't. Lathan, tree folk forest,

[6035.54s -> 6039.83s]  Um what the fuck do you want me to do now? What? Where the fuck am I?
[6040.71s -> 6048.07s]  Can I choose a different part of the map? Bogs on the moors. I can't see a thing not even my feet.
[6051.45s -> 6064.09s]  This guy sucks. What? Jesus. Welcome back Lathan. I have finished new scrolls for you.
[6064.65s -> 6070.01s]  Here are three scrolls inscribed with spells of release. This guy can't even walk correctly.
[6070.01s -> 6080.98s]  And accelerate that which should not be bound together. Okay. Now which scrolls should I work
[6080.98s -> 6087.32s]  on next? Which scrolls should you work on next? Okay so I have scroll of release. Didn't those
[6087.32s -> 6096.41s]  people in the water say release? Spell of traveling. Now choose where in the kingdom of

[6102.01s -> 6108.01s]  waterfalls or the eldritch forest. Haunted waterfalls. I have I got the spell of release.

[6130.65s -> 6166.95s]  Press the help. That's not gonna help me. No go. Didn't they say release us?
[6171.53s -> 6174.57s]  Spell of release. So how do I just like can I like cast it?
[6175.61s -> 6193.38s]  Click it. Right click. Left click. It just closes it. Okay bye. Press three. No I don't want to.
[6193.38s -> 6208.95s]  Don't go to the lower pools. The tree folk forest. You are the wood elves? The people of the forest?
[6209.51s -> 6214.79s]  Yes and we know of your quest. Mobus was our friend and we offer you the help of the wood elf
[6214.79s -> 6222.41s]  staff. Well let me let me get it. Wait is this a trick? This is a trick isn't it?
[6226.46s -> 6230.46s]  Take the staff to the fairy circle in the forest and give it to the fairies.
[6235.00s -> 6249.74s]  Take it to the fairy circle in the forest. Forester's camp guild hall center of Glen
[6250.46s -> 6255.66s]  foresters. This is forester's camp right? That's the middle of the forest.
[6256.06s -> 6277.78s]  Go away. Strangers aren't welcome. I can't click the link. I can't alt tab out of the game otherwise it'll break.
[6278.42s -> 6285.02s]  Fairy circle.
[6293.13s -> 6304.10s]  Strength left. What? I've heard that kind of singing before. The fairies must be here.
[6307.08s -> 6311.56s]  Okay wait wait. Spell of the wood elf staff. Spell of release. Spell of seeing.
[6313.24s -> 6314.04s]  Wood elf staff.
[6319.80s -> 6330.71s]  Seeing first. I see them. What strange little fellows. Okay here's your staff.
[6337.37s -> 6342.25s]  You have returned that which can shield us from torlog. Therefore we now show you
[6343.13s -> 6349.45s]  the castle of crystal. Goodbye friend. Goodbye. Be sure to try our delicious cookies.
[6350.25s -> 6355.48s]  The one with the fudge in the middle is my favorite. Crystal castle. I can just go to it.
[6356.20s -> 6377.93s]  Spell of release. I'm holding them in my hands. I'm holding the spells in my hands.
[6382.30s -> 6385.74s]  What? No what? Crystal chivers.
[6388.70s -> 6397.11s]  So I'm not actually a wizard. Okay so that just keeps me alive. I can't go in the door.
[6397.99s -> 6433.51s]  Foresters camp. Wait zoom out. This game's not that big is it? I can't go anywhere else besides
[6433.51s -> 6441.62s]  like the one area that I am. Well then let me go to the tree. Let me go back to the foresters camp.
[6441.62s -> 6451.43s]  This guy just yells at me. What? You again? I told you to go away. Well what are you gonna do?
[6452.63s -> 6468.86s]  Okay center of glendo. Leave Wygaard Nathan. The guild lords are tools of the plague magician who
[6468.86s -> 6476.58s]  is Torlog's ally. Flee across the marsh wastes and into isles. Flee across the marsh wastes into
[6478.58s -> 6487.18s]  subtitles. Do you really think that a game that came out like 32 years ago is gonna have subtitles
[6487.18s -> 6512.04s]  in the options? A blind beggar. Spell of seeing. You healed me. When the town hears of your powers
[6512.04s -> 6516.12s]  the guild lords will have to give you safe passes to the haunted waterfall.
[6519.40s -> 6521.56s]  So the guild I got to go to the guild hall.
[6528.23s -> 6547.93s]  Go to the guild hall. This is an instant death screen. Ancient runes. I wonder how I can understand
[6547.93s -> 6572.60s]  them. Scroll of seeing. I need the scroll of understanding. So I can let me go back to the
[6572.60s -> 6611.11s]  magician then. Path. Skip. Skip. Skip it. Now which scrolls should I work on next?
[6612.23s -> 6620.87s]  I want you to work on scroll of understanding. I'll choose. It's too crusty. Is it too crusty?
[6620.87s -> 6626.79s]  The village of glendo. Just wait. Or once you lived the haunted waterfalls or the eldritch forest.
[6627.83s -> 6635.27s]  All right I need to go to the forest. Thank you. Give me the staff. I have the people of the
[6635.27s -> 6656.71s]  forest? Yes. Give me that. Take the staff. All right. Later. Your eye don't like you.
[6658.71s -> 6669.53s]  Very certain. There it is. Let's get the. I don't understand what this does.
[6670.73s -> 6675.77s]  This doesn't kill me. I just smell something and it makes me feel bad. I have no strength left.
[6677.05s -> 6679.69s]  Okay. Cool. Here's your staff.
[6685.37s -> 6691.59s]  Now I see them. What strange little fellows.
[6693.75s -> 6695.67s]  Your health is the tree branch at the top of the.
[6697.19s -> 6700.47s]  Okay. That's. That could be the worst health bar I've ever seen in my whole life.
[6703.59s -> 6712.98s]  You have returned that which. All right. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Quest complete. Now I've got the
[6712.98s -> 6726.17s]  crystal castle opened. Let's go with them. All right. You went into the kill this time.
[6726.17s -> 6738.73s]  You didn't kill me last time. Have returned. The new scrolls are complete. These scrolls of
[6738.73s -> 6744.09s]  understanding give you knowledge of ancient alphabets and unfamiliar tongues. Use them
[6744.09s -> 6755.26s]  when you encounter these barriers. Thanks. Now which scrolls should I work on next?
[6755.26s -> 6763.11s]  All right. So now I want to go to that rock. Spell of travel. I'll choose where in the kingdom
[6763.11s -> 6768.84s]  of why I wish to go. Where the hell was that? Village of Glendale. Once you lived the haunted
[6768.84s -> 6781.34s]  waterfalls. The scrolls of next game. Leave why God Nathan. The guild lords are tools of the
[6781.34s -> 6793.03s]  play magician. It's pretty good. All right. Let's go get the. There's the guilt. Wait, wait, wait.
[6793.03s -> 6800.73s]  Okay. Hold on. Out spirits of Glendale. The cure of the blind. The blindness. Go to the
[6800.73s -> 6812.57s]  guild hall. Blind beggar. You healed me when the town hears of your powers. The guild lords will
[6812.65s -> 6819.26s]  have to give you safe passes to the haunted waterfall. It is the law. Thank you.
[6823.22s -> 6827.50s]  Back up to center of Glendale and then to the guild hall.
[6831.96s -> 6837.96s]  Nathan, we're so proud of you. Everyone in Glendale has heard about how you healed the blind beggar.
[6839.16s -> 6846.09s]  Even the guild lords are impressed, Nathan. Why would that make you concerned? Oh dear,
[6846.09s -> 6856.62s]  that's not good. Guild hall. Healers belong at the waterfall. But I'm guard Stakeham. What?
[6867.32s -> 6875.29s]  Okay, does anybody have any idea what just happened? The guild hall has even heard about
[6875.29s -> 6880.81s]  your beautiful efforts and they really like you. Okay, go to guild hall. Yeah, don't let him in.
[6881.61s -> 6888.65s]  Get, seize him and send him to the pool of knowledge. I don't get it. Seize him.
[6888.65s -> 6894.10s]  That's usually something that happens when something bad happens to you afterwards.
[6901.69s -> 6902.41s]  Is this going to kill me?
[6915.90s -> 6925.50s]  All right, kids, I'm sorry. I got nothing for you. I got to go back down to where that scroll was.
[6926.22s -> 6930.46s]  No, I'm going to breathe in the fucking like fart gas. Can you tell me anything more?
[6930.54s -> 6937.26s]  Apprentice, the plague magician knows of your quest and he is waiting in the forest for you.
[6938.54s -> 6945.85s]  What are you talking about? I thought I, center of Glendale, I'm going down
[6950.34s -> 6961.43s]  and it's outskirts and then it's the scroll of understanding I can do down here. Friend,
[6961.43s -> 6968.57s]  can you help me? I, I have heard stories about relic hidden in the forest in the castle of
[6968.57s -> 6974.57s]  crystal. I've also heard that fairies guard the path. Now go Lathan, this place is not safe for you.
[6976.41s -> 6979.61s]  This what place? Why is everybody not, why does everybody hate me?
[6980.41s -> 6991.34s]  Barren rocks. There it is. Scroll of understanding. Ancient runes. I wonder how I can understand them.
[6992.38s -> 6999.59s]  Scroll of understanding. In the black keep are the runes of Iscar which hold the power of law in
[6999.59s -> 7026.89s]  that kingdom. That literally did not even help me at all. Okay, so might as well see who this is.
[7053.78s -> 7058.98s]  I'm going to be honest. Good, you have returned. If there's that much voltage going through that
[7058.98s -> 7065.06s]  crystal, that shit's going to be humming. With them, you can go anywhere. If there's 600,000
[7065.06s -> 7068.58s]  volts going through that thing, you're going to, you'll hear that from fucking 50 feet away.
[7071.59s -> 7075.90s]  You ain't going to touch that. Now, which scrolls should I work on next?
[7076.46s -> 7082.81s]  Why don't you work on the spell of release? I'll choose where it is.
[7086.95s -> 7093.35s]  Where once you lived, the haunted forest or the eldritch forest. The amps kill you, not the volts.
[7095.91s -> 7104.94s]  I'm sorry, I'm not an electrician. I have the spell of release, so why shouldn't I go to waterfall?
[7116.68s -> 7122.68s]  Release the spell of rest. You must use your magic to release us from our spell of traveling.
[7123.64s -> 7145.54s]  That's a skull. Black keep? Sea dwellers' pavilion? The high ground. Just go into the palace.
[7145.54s -> 7150.26s]  Just teleport. Wait, does teleport into the boss's room, the throne room behind him and like bash his
[7150.26s -> 7171.32s]  head with a rock? This is Drake's Blood's palace, you know, and his wizards won't like your coming
[7171.32s -> 7179.10s]  here. They get very jealous. How do you know I'm a wizard? Ha! House travels in these hard times.
[7184.12s -> 7186.04s]  What? What do you mean, who else trapped?
[7188.84s -> 7201.02s]  Hard core, yourself? I played for Grace Delight, the true ruler of Iscar, until Drake's Blood
[7201.02s -> 7207.18s]  imprisoned her in the North Tower and claimed the throne. He was corrupted by Torlok, as are many
[7207.18s -> 7228.70s]  here. Which door way? I'm gonna go up and through this door. Look at that posture pog.
[7229.98s -> 7236.30s]  I found him! I found him! You're another wizard looking for the relics. Well, you may find a way
[7236.30s -> 7241.66s]  to Alcatesh if you can make the tapestry of seeing in the south chamber reveal its secret.
[7242.22s -> 7253.50s]  Why are they letting me just walk around the castle? Where are the guards? We're just eating dinner.
[7253.50s -> 7261.37s]  That's a good air. It looks like it's been a while since good was done around here.
[7261.37s -> 7265.77s]  Oh, I bet you've come like the others to slay the king.
[7268.17s -> 7279.82s]  Rock! Um, so, this is mocking me because I'm here to kill the king.
[7280.70s -> 7285.58s]  Right, so why am I not, why am I allowed to just walk around? Okay, what about this doorway?
[7286.78s -> 7289.90s]  I can't do anything else here. Door, we'll go up here.
[7290.86s -> 7296.42s]  Oh, sure. Hello, um, I, uh, well, I... You're another wizard looking for the relics.
[7296.42s -> 7302.18s]  Well, you may find a way to Alcatesh if you can make the tapestry of seeing in the south...
[7302.18s -> 7309.98s]  Get out of here. Oh, hello, I, um, well, I, I, I, I don't know.
[7310.94s -> 7315.16s]  Look, the wizard's back. Who are the others you mentioned before?
[7316.04s -> 7320.04s]  Apprentices of daylight. They live in the palace now.
[7324.84s -> 7331.90s]  Oh no, I went into the time room. You just have this unguarded?
[7332.86s -> 7339.69s]  This is just an open doorway into like a fucking portal. Um, I don't know.
[7339.69s -> 7353.37s]  Hello? Wait, why am I here? Where's the wizard?
[7355.05s -> 7360.97s]  He's dead. I need more help. The rightful ruler of Iscar can help you, Lathan.
[7361.69s -> 7388.63s]  He died. That was his force ghost. Keep going. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Out.
[7390.63s -> 7404.01s]  Get on the high ground. Lathan, be cautious. Bandits who will steal everything you carry
[7404.01s -> 7407.53s]  roam the rocky desert. Leave me the fuck alone.
[7408.49s -> 7419.96s]  Shimmering oasis. Dunes people campsite. Temple of Syndra.
[7428.39s -> 7430.23s]  Shimmering oasis. That's going to be healing, I think.
[7436.73s -> 7441.35s]  Pool. What do you mean pool? There's no pool here.
[7443.19s -> 7455.26s]  There's no, there's no, there's no pool. That's not a pool. This is a mirage. That's sand.
[7460.31s -> 7465.91s]  A drink from the sand. That'll, I'm gonna die.
[7472.57s -> 7482.49s]  Who is, who is, Electra.
[7508.84s -> 7514.20s]  One more. This is the third attempt. Last try. This time, last try, this is it.
[7516.04s -> 7519.16s]  This time I'm going to start with the scroll of traveling because that's the best one.
[7519.72s -> 7538.44s]  Now choose where in the game. Let's go to, I just want to see.
[7539.56s -> 7543.80s]  A troublemaker if I ever saw one. But I'm. Dodge, take him.
[7557.24s -> 7563.26s]  I got instantly eaten by rats. And I will have your spells ready soon.
[7563.26s -> 7572.78s]  Oh, come on. Please. I just want the scroll. Let's go to the marsh wastes. What? Is this
[7572.78s -> 7580.17s]  an instant kill screen? The marsh wastes. What a dreary place. I can hardly see where to step.
[7580.97s -> 7582.97s]  Yeah, this is a, this is a, spell of seeing.
[7594.62s -> 7599.27s]  Wise. Wise? Wise.
[7605.80s -> 7616.68s]  Uh, nothing I can do on this screen. Okay, we're back at the shimmering oasis. Don't touch that.
[7617.64s -> 7629.32s]  Uh, how about the dunes people campsite? Do you know anything about magic about the relics?
[7629.32s -> 7635.08s]  Our legend says that the relics of Mobus can free the kingdoms from the shadow of evil.
[7635.08s -> 7642.97s]  But that is an ancient story. Okay, well, thanks. I guess.
[7643.13s -> 7653.35s]  Um, lost mines, mountain cliffs. That's a, well, that's a fall down and I scream. Let's go to the
[7653.35s -> 7666.34s]  lost mines. I advise you to seek out the Amazons of the oasis and they will help if you can prove
[7666.34s -> 7680.10s]  yourself worthy. Thank you. The different guy. Was that a different force of ghost? How many
[7680.10s -> 7696.14s]  force ghost Obi-Wans do I know? Holy shit, we made it.
[7702.30s -> 7707.83s]  There's an explosion sound too. I knew it. I.
[7712.49s -> 7718.73s]  Lathan, be cautious. Bandits who will steal everything you carry roam the rocky desert.
[7718.73s -> 7735.90s]  Desert oasis. Okay. Welcome. Since Torlok drove us from our home in the west, we have not trusted
[7735.90s -> 7743.77s]  your kind, but perhaps you are the one our legends speak of. Farewell. What do you mean farewell?
[7744.57s -> 7750.55s]  Perhaps you're the one that the legend speaks of. Bye. Get out of here.
[7751.51s -> 7758.66s]  Leave. All right. Well, we have to go into the temple then temple of syndrome.
[7771.00s -> 7783.32s]  Let's go. Stranger. Not all of us are under Torlok's influence. Look hard.
[7783.88s -> 7798.79s]  There is knowledge hidden here. All right. This doorway looks scary. This one looks safe.
[7799.75s -> 7811.37s]  You have to go to the one that looks scary, I think. For the blood sword of the Argent
[7811.45s -> 7819.02s]  Kings. Look in the black key. Black key for the sword.
[7825.32s -> 7860.30s]  Stranger. I feel like we missed a whole lot before that happened. To me, that seems like we should
[7860.30s -> 7865.58s]  have gotten at least to the middle point there where I was sacrificed to a giant demon.
[7868.15s -> 7881.91s]  Wizard mode. All right, with the wizard mode. Leave. Why God, Lathan, the guild lords are
[7881.91s -> 7887.51s]  tools of the plague magician who is Torlok's ally. Flee across the marsh wastes and into isles.
[7889.58s -> 7895.48s]  So I don't start with any spells. I can't, I don't have my crutch.
[7900.90s -> 7907.77s]  Ho fellow. Who are you? Gordon the Huntsman. I know much of these woods. For example, I know
[7907.77s -> 7913.61s]  that the crystal of Kaldar will enable you to overcome the crystal tigers. Come back sometime
[7913.61s -> 7920.46s]  and I'll share a story with you. Wait, does this mean that I'm already, I already am like a,
[7921.58s -> 7936.41s]  wizard mode is the same game? I'm going to go down to the barren rocks. If you don't complete
[7936.41s -> 7959.13s]  this game, I'm going to leave. I don't know what you want me to say. Last hope to find the relics
[7960.09s -> 7969.29s]  and why did I show up here? As I do, but until you hold the relics, be cautious in your use of magic.
[7969.85s -> 7978.06s]  I understand day long. So here's my question. The 22 wizards, I think it's just me over and over
[7978.06s -> 7984.54s]  inscribed with spells of seeing. They bring sight to the blind and show those with vision that
[7985.67s -> 7990.23s]  now, which is cool. I figured it out. All right. I want the scroll of traveling.
[7990.23s -> 7999.98s]  I'll choose where in the kingdom of why I wish to go. I want to go to the haunted waterfalls.
[8009.26s -> 8012.70s]  You must use your magic to release the spell of rest.
[8013.66s -> 8033.56s]  Right. Something in my eye. You are the world. Here's the forest. Yes. And we know what your
[8033.56s -> 8053.93s]  quest was our friend. And we all. What else? Yeah. Okay. Very circle. I don't want to do that again.
[8053.93s -> 8064.46s]  I've already done that. Just give me my scroll of teleportation, please. I go for the blind man.
[8064.94s -> 8078.81s]  It's the ball. You healed me. When the town hears of your powers,
[8078.81s -> 8083.29s]  the guild lords will have to give you safe passage to the haunted waterfalls.
[8083.29s -> 8091.54s]  It is the law. Safe passage to the waterfall. Okay. That brings us up here.
[8092.18s -> 8094.66s]  We're just going to go in order. We'll go back to the healing pools.
[8094.66s -> 8122.38s]  Thank you for not being electrified. Okay. I'm good to go. Now we're going to go from here
[8123.10s -> 8130.20s]  to the upper pools. And then, no, this is the stupid singing ghost thing.
[8136.87s -> 8138.79s]  This is like the legend of Zelda's CD-i.
[8141.03s -> 8150.04s]  All right. I want to go back to the, I just wasted a heal. Yeah, I did. Can you tell me anything
[8150.04s -> 8155.48s]  more? Apprentice, the plague magician knows of your quest. I know he does.
[8160.34s -> 8169.11s]  I need to go get my spell of travel. Go away. Strangers aren't welcome. Wasn't this the guy
[8169.11s -> 8175.91s]  that just told me come anytime and he'll tell me a story. My son was your age when he learned
[8175.91s -> 8183.56s]  that the cold fire which burns on the marsh waste can destroy the mist monsters. Thanks lady.
[8189.93s -> 8201.75s]  Hello again. Martin. I once held the second relic, the hunting horn for many a year after
[8201.75s -> 8208.71s]  Mobus was gone. Now Skylar, the keeper of the clouds holds it. That's all my story, lad. Good day.
[8211.30s -> 8217.22s]  Thanks for the story. That's the whole story. I'm going to go to the rocks.
[8217.22s -> 8225.83s]  No, fuck. No, it's all right. I want to go here. Kill me again, Marshmallow people. I want the
[8225.83s -> 8232.60s]  scroll of travel. Give me the scroll of travel. I want to go to the one place I haven't gone
[8232.60s -> 8240.78s]  and then I'm going to fucking delete this game from my inventory. Good. You have returned.
[8240.78s -> 8247.66s]  The new scrolls are complete. These scrolls contain traveling spells. This is a 20-hour game.
[8248.54s -> 8257.50s]  I'll choose. All right, it doesn't matter where I go. Let's just go to the waterfall and I'm
[8257.50s -> 8266.54s]  teleporting. There we go. I want to go to, so that's the palace. I want to go to the sea
[8266.54s -> 8272.76s]  dwellers pavilion. That's the only place I haven't gone in the whole world. Wait, I haven't gone to
[8272.76s -> 8287.58s]  Dalen's mansion. Dalen's mansion. Oh fuck, that's the magician's house. I have not completed your
[8287.58s -> 8295.26s]  scrolls yet, Lathan. Continue your quest and I will have your spells ready soon. Shit. Oh no,
[8295.26s -> 8300.62s]  god, come on. I thought it was a dude. I don't know the guy's name is Dalen. He never even
[8300.62s -> 8319.98s]  introduced himself. You may not travel in poor health. What? He says it every time you enter.
[8320.70s -> 8323.34s]  I don't have subtitles and this is all the voice acting I hear.
[8323.82s -> 8326.60s]  Oh, you are doing a very good job.
[8328.44s -> 8342.39s]  It's like talking through a sock. I want to see that ship.
[8347.80s -> 8356.07s]  Going back to the pool. Send me back to the pool.
[8362.31s -> 8364.31s]  I think he said healers belong at the waterfall.
[8364.79s -> 8372.71s]  Use them healers of all the ages. Travel far. Overlook no source of health.
[8374.46s -> 8380.82s]  There we go. Teleport to the ship. Let's go. Sea dwellers pavilion.
[8401.51s -> 8420.78s]  Shit. There is East Coast Sea. East. East Sea Coast. East West Sea Coast. Let's go West Sea Coast.
[8420.78s -> 8446.01s]  Scroll of, scroll of scene. He saw it all right. He just touched it. Yeah.
[8446.01s -> 8451.45s]  Dalen, I need more help. He didn't even die. He passed out. That doesn't count as a lie.
[8453.37s -> 8466.18s]  I fainted. Okay, this is East Coast Sea. Valley of the Argent Kings.
[8466.90s -> 8479.21s]  Okay. She has her trust right here. Only with the orb of moments can the coins be obtained.
[8480.33s -> 8500.14s]  What if I go real fast? All right, take the coins or check something else.
[8509.78s -> 8523.85s]  It's a fucking electric one. Everything has 50,000 amps going through it. 50,000 amps going through it.
[8528.25s -> 8540.63s]  Oh, and you explode. Oh, that was great. All right, so we're going to move on.
[8541.51s -> 8546.95s]  We're going to play Space Ace now. There's another one I've never played before.
[8547.59s -> 8552.70s]  I don't even know how the hell this one works. I'm going to take a quick
[8552.70s -> 8573.14s]  pee before we play this one. Oh, crap. Space Ace. Electrician and Chad actually
[8573.14s -> 8587.43s]  just said it's the volts, not the amps. I know. Okay, so give me a second.
[8588.47s -> 8592.17s]  I'll be right back. I'm going to pee. I'm going to grab a water and we'll continue.
[8676.23s -> 8689.50s]  Totally compact. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.
[8709.53s -> 8725.50s]  Get me out of here. Thank you, Kimmy. I'm just kidnapped by aliens, that's all.
[8737.32s -> 8746.47s]  Totally compact. All right, Space Ace.
[8747.27s -> 8765.56s]  Oh, crap. Far out. Let's start it. This is also Don Bluth. Oh, wait, wait, before I get in here.
[8767.72s -> 8780.44s]  Show the picture. Oh, god, that's ugly. Thank you, Kimmy. Oh, that's a great photo.
[8781.40s -> 8816.98s]  That's a good photo. Show the photo. Hold on. Let's go. Oh, shit, it is one of these.
[8817.88s -> 8826.47s]  It is one of these. It's another one of these. Okay, move guide. Move beeps on
[8827.19s -> 8835.64s]  arcade cabinet off five lives. Difficulty. I don't even know what these mean. Cadet.
[8838.02s -> 8854.78s]  You definitely want move guide. I'm doing cadet. How hard is this one compared to Dragon's Lair?
[8855.50s -> 8859.30s]  Well, what about captain? I'll try captain. I'll try it.
[8862.49s -> 8870.84s]  Cabinet is spelled wrong. I'm gonna give it a go. Let's go.
[8884.94s -> 8891.14s]  Why is the genie evil? That was the genie from Aladdin. Oh, no, it's not. It's just
[8896.42s -> 8926.02s]  it's right twice. Energize? Huh? Oh, god. Go. How the fuck did I do that?
[8926.82s -> 8938.34s]  I did it. I did it. How did I do that? Guys, I'm fucking locked in.
[8951.30s -> 8979.96s]  Up. No, it's okay. Is it down? Maybe it's down. Oh, dude, it's too much.
[8986.55s -> 9004.44s]  Huh? Put on the guide. I got through that pretty quickly without the guide.
[9004.44s -> 9032.62s]  Up. Left. Right. Energize. Is it the same actor that played
[9034.23s -> 9057.59s]  who's the antagonist from Dexter's lab? What the fuck is happening? It's up. It's up twice.
[9057.59s -> 9088.47s]  Then it's left and then left. All right. What the fuck is happening? I don't even... I gotta
[9088.47s -> 9105.21s]  turn on the guides. I think, man, this is like too ridiculous. I'm gonna try this one more time.
[9107.11s -> 9125.90s]  You get chatified. Energize. So don't move. What? What the fuck? I thought it was energized.
[9142.38s -> 9154.44s]  So that energizes... but am I not... I'm putting on the guide. I don't care.
[9156.18s -> 9163.62s]  I don't care. It's going on. It's going on. Get it on. It's going on. I can't even do it yet.
[9169.40s -> 9171.64s]  What am I supposed to do during the energize sequence though?
[9174.63s -> 9190.41s]  Doesn't he stand here? See, right? I have no idea. All right. No. Then. Right. And. Up. And. Hey.
[9202.82s -> 9205.62s]  Oh, I could care less about... I've put... There's too many in a row.
[9208.25s -> 9212.01s]  I'm putting the guide on. I'll do it on hard, but I'm putting... I ain't doing this one without
[9212.01s -> 9238.12s]  the guide. I'll tell you. I'll put it on ace. No fucking way. Don't worry. I'll still fuck it up.
[9238.12s -> 9262.70s]  Holy shit. New path. This didn't happen before. It's too fast, man. It's too quick. I don't even
[9262.70s -> 9279.90s]  have time to react to the scenes. Oh, this would have never been done without the guide. Oh, fuck.
[9280.62s -> 9285.75s]  Hard mode is so fast, it skips cutscenes and dials.
[9287.35s -> 9307.59s]  Does it? Should I put it back on what it was before? Yes, I should. Put it on cadet
[9309.00s -> 9312.76s]  so you can see all the... All right. We'll do cadet. We're just gonna... We're gonna enjoy the game.
[9313.56s -> 9330.01s]  Cadet is just... Cadet with move... Cadet no move guide. No... I don't know if I can do it.
[9330.01s -> 9342.02s]  I don't think I can do it. I can't do it. Sometimes you have to admit when you're capable of doing
[9342.02s -> 9361.14s]  something. It's still... It doesn't matter. I can still fuck it up and I still will over and over
[9361.14s -> 9394.49s]  again. This music is getting in my brain. It's the song. Let's go. What? I didn't get a guide.
[9395.21s -> 9408.57s]  I didn't get a guide for that one. Okay, remember this part? This part sucked.
[9411.43s -> 9412.71s]  Sherwin was demoralized.
[9419.53s -> 9436.18s]  It's too loud now. I have to turn it down. Hold on. I gotta turn it back down. It was way too loud.
[9440.95s -> 9442.07s]  That voice doesn't even match.
[9445.03s -> 9460.46s]  Here we go. Left. Shoot.
[9470.74s -> 9492.70s]  I hate this music so much. All right. Was it that? Okay, the...
[9496.20s -> 9498.12s]  Go. All right. I finally made it past this part.
[9505.27s -> 9506.63s]  I'll save you, Jimmy.
[9527.53s -> 9530.73s]  No way would I have done this shit without the guide.
[9531.69s -> 9536.12s]  This would have been a meltdown. An absolute total meltdown stream.
[9540.01s -> 9556.94s]  Turn back the music. Energize. Quick. Quick. Turn on your online profile.
[9557.66s -> 9582.78s]  Get on those forums. Oh, no, no, no, no. He got banned. Oh my god. It's left. Wait,
[9582.78s -> 9611.83s]  this guy's name is Dexter. There. Left. I know everyone was begging me to turn these on.
[9612.71s -> 9619.38s]  No, dude. You don't understand. Like, turn it on. Turn them on.
[9619.94s -> 9633.13s]  Oh. No, why would I do that? No, no, no, no. Please, man. Do it. Please.
[9634.17s -> 9638.46s]  We're looking out for you. Thank you. I appreciate that. You're looking out for me.
[9644.71s -> 9665.59s]  This is definitely a pants shit game. What? Look at this shit. There's too many things going on.
[9665.59s -> 9686.07s]  Turn back. Holy shit. It's just draining all of my energy.
[9688.07s -> 9692.87s]  I'm drained right now. I am. All of my fucking molecules.
[9710.31s -> 9727.05s]  I'm leaning back in my chair and I'm doing some more hard blinking.
[9727.05s -> 9747.40s]  That's Ursula. Wait, that's that. It's that person. Okay. Hold on. Give me a minute. I need to
[9747.40s -> 9757.94s]  actually blink. You know when somebody uploads an entire movie to YouTube and they do like the funny
[9757.94s -> 9765.72s]  joke words every time the person says the word cheese, it times two speeds itself. That's what
[9765.72s -> 9781.35s]  I feel like I'm watching. Okay. Let's try it again. I thought the cadet was supposed to slow this shit
[9781.35s -> 9786.68s]  down. Let's speed it up. Is there blood coming out of my nose? No, I'm all right.
[9791.98s -> 9797.50s]  It's space ace, but every time they say the word kidney, it times 10 speed.
[9808.30s -> 9809.90s]  He just ate like a bunch of Cheetos.
[9816.66s -> 9828.20s]  He didn't even eat me. Oh, come on. I did it.
[9829.16s -> 9851.13s]  I may have thrown up playing this game. I just...
[9858.68s -> 9860.44s]  I made it. Okay. I made it through that one. We're good.
[9865.26s -> 9865.58s]  What?
[9883.22s -> 9885.43s]  Somebody's screaming in my face.
[9896.31s -> 9900.87s]  It is actually painful. You're right. It's actually kind of painful to watch. I can't imagine how it
[9900.87s -> 9906.07s]  looks on your screen because it looks like this on my screen. I imagine what it looks like on yours.
[9908.04s -> 9908.68s]  I did it.
[9927.61s -> 9928.41s]  It's colors.
[9935.22s -> 9936.42s]  I'll get it. I'll get through it.
[9936.42s -> 9959.24s]  Oh, let's go. It's such a small window.
[9965.51s -> 9980.73s]  I need to hold on. I need to break. I need to take a break. I need to break. This actually is
[9980.73s -> 9985.37s]  like hurting my head. I need to fucking break. Hold on.
[9987.93s -> 9998.65s]  Oh, Frank.
[10019.05s -> 10022.89s]  All right. Just everybody relax for a minute. We need to take a second. Just everybody calm the
[10022.89s -> 10030.12s]  fuck down. Okay. Just take a second. We're going to just relax. Imagine doing this shit without
[10030.12s -> 10036.14s]  the guy. I want you all to just think about that. That's never going to happen. That would never
[10036.14s -> 10052.86s]  happen. I would fail the first sequence over a hundred times. No guide with ace difficulty.
[10052.86s -> 10066.10s]  That would be a really interesting run to watch. All right. I think I'm all right.
[10067.06s -> 10080.65s]  I've just taken a moment. I'm ready to continue. Here we go. Let's try it again.
[10083.78s -> 10087.78s]  All right. That's what we're looking for here. This is all one sequence. Remember that one.
[10105.96s -> 10113.11s]  You cannot win.
[10127.40s -> 10142.76s]  I missed it again. Oh my fucking god. I tried to hold it in. I couldn't.
[10146.10s -> 10153.86s]  Dexter, you're late. Call me ace. Huh? How funny. Thanks. I'll walk. Monster. Dexter,
[10153.86s -> 10160.73s]  the infant array is about to be fired at her. Where's the ray located? In the center of the
[10160.73s -> 10187.69s]  complex. Can you get us in there? Yes. This is fucking ridiculous. I feel like this is what
[10187.69s -> 10200.46s]  happens. I keep seeing that in my head and with my eyes open. That's not that's bad, right? I think
[10200.46s -> 10208.06s]  so. Dexter, you're late. Call me ace. Huh? How funny. Thanks. I'll walk. I'm seeing these images
[10208.06s -> 10214.49s]  after they happen. Dexter, the infant array is about to be fired at her. Where's the ray located?
[10215.21s -> 10218.33s]  In the center of the complex. Can you get us in there? Yes.
[10219.85s -> 10225.29s]  No, I'm here. Yes, he's geared for battle. What? Wait, didn't we just go that way with his own
[10225.29s -> 10240.36s]  inventory? No, I saw it again. No, I'm going to see it again in 10 seconds.
[10248.73s -> 10253.85s]  No, no, I don't want to see it again. I'm going to see it again. I don't want to see it.
[10254.57s -> 10267.53s]  Okay, I didn't get a prompt. Dexter, you're late. Call me ace. Huh? How funny. Thanks. I'll walk.
[10269.35s -> 10271.99s]  Dexter, the infant array is about to be fired at her.
[10274.55s -> 10278.95s]  Where's the ray located? In the center of the complex. Can you get us in there? Yes.
[10279.75s -> 10286.26s]  Like nuts. No, I'm here. Yes, he's geared for battle. Let's see if we shoot for for the zone
[10286.26s -> 10294.18s]  inventory. Why, yes. Let's see if we can get it. Get serious. I am. Watch out for a full buddy.
[10295.14s -> 10305.46s]  Here we come. Dexter, call me ace, huh? What happened? Did it win? Use the aquabooms. Wait,
[10305.46s -> 10316.01s]  why did I? If the webcam was on, you guys would have just been like, holy shit, dude. You need
[10316.01s -> 10348.82s]  to go to like the doctor. I'm out of oxygen. Use the aquabooms. Use the aquabooms. He's in the tank.
[10354.36s -> 10359.86s]  I did it. Okay, it's down. Shoot. How did we end up?
[10359.94s -> 10404.65s]  Okay, you know when there's that the white background? No, it's like the dots on the screen.
[10410.98s -> 10416.58s]  Why do we think that was so funny? Why was that so funny? We just, were we dead?
[10416.58s -> 10449.93s]  Dead? That's funny to you guys that you're dead. What? We're dead. No, we're in different clothes.
[10456.28s -> 10471.05s]  Go. Energize. Fight. And it's dodging.
[10481.58s -> 10502.65s]  God damn it. It was up, not. It's just a button, but that button, if it's not pressed,
[10502.65s -> 10522.20s]  within a tenth of a second, it's over. And you've got colors all over the screen and screaming and
[10522.92s -> 10526.12s]  and dodging and lightning everywhere.
[10616.22s -> 10619.10s]  Holy shit, imagine this shit on higher difficulty.
[10620.30s -> 10634.71s]  Throw it on your face cam. Sure. I don't care. Fine. If I don't do it this time.
[10682.18s -> 10699.13s]  Oh, I broke my computer. Oh great, I gotta re-plug this in. Shit. I'm good. Hey guys,
[10699.45s -> 10711.00s]  you want to see the cam? Turn cam on, man. What would my Joker laugh be? Honestly,
[10711.00s -> 10720.79s]  I'll do a pretty good one in a second. Hold on. Let's go plug in the webcam. I'll do a good one.
[10725.91s -> 10733.83s]  There's a couple ways to do the Joker. There's high pitched. Well, this is the original Joker,
[10733.83s -> 10742.49s]  which is sort of like, with your mouth open really wide. And then there's into the cartoon,
[10742.49s -> 10750.28s]  the animated Joker, which was more of like a, almost like a witch, I would say. Something along
[10750.28s -> 10760.39s]  the lines of high pitched and really, really big, big smile. Like, that's an original animated
[10760.39s -> 10771.18s]  Batman series. And then from there, we went to obviously he's stalling. Oh, for the love of God.
[10771.18s -> 10777.80s]  Fine. Here's my Joker laugh. I've been working on this. I almost just knocked over a fucking glass.
[10779.50s -> 10791.42s]  Stalling. Is this, am I even logged in? You can't even see it. Yeah, I am stalling. You're right.
[10791.42s -> 10825.06s]  And you know why? Because I only see her colors right now. How do I fucking do this? I forget how
[10825.06s -> 10838.31s]  to put the webcam on. I swear to God. There we go. Okay. Who the fuck's supposed to be sitting
[10838.31s -> 10853.70s]  there? Monkey ass. Alrighty. I set it for you so you don't have to. Is that good? All right. That's
[10853.70s -> 10860.92s]  fine. Like this shit even matters. Let's just put it over the, okay. Here we go. Oh, there's no
[10860.92s -> 10921.24s]  controller, right? Okay. That sound. We didn't get the Joker laugh. Oh, sorry. I forgot.
[10923.64s -> 10927.48s]  I forgot. I forgot. That wasn't it. That was me saying. I forgot.
[10928.20s -> 10929.40s]  Okay.
[10929.40s -> 10948.70s]  This is a fake webcam. I should just delay the webcam for five minutes. The webcam actually
[10948.70s -> 10952.62s]  makes this harder for me because not only am I aware of the stuff on screen, I'm aware of you
[10952.62s -> 10960.14s]  looking at my face. Guys, I treat face cam the same way I treat somebody who is watching me eat a
[10960.14s -> 10966.58s]  sandwich. Like I know you're looking at my face right now and it's like, I don't want you to look
[10966.58s -> 11003.10s]  at my face. All right. I got to fucking, I have to do this. I don't care. Let's go. I'm so close.
[11008.22s -> 11013.90s]  My keyboard is fucked up. It's like, did you hear that? Did you hear the space bar get hit
[11013.90s -> 11020.71s]  and it didn't happen? You heard it. I know you did. I've lost my mind. I can't do it.
[11022.65s -> 11032.18s]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 10 milliseconds behind. There's been too many fucking QTEs today.
[11032.18s -> 11117.74s]  I won. I just beat it.
[11117.74s -> 11142.74s]  Oh, so that was a lot more intense and a lot shorter than, um, Dragon Age. No, not Dragon
[11142.74s -> 11162.47s]  Age. Dragon's lair. Okay. Remember I was about to say something. So that, you know, when you look
[11162.47s -> 11167.43s]  at the dots, the, the little splotches on the screen, it's like stare at the center of this
[11167.43s -> 11173.91s]  image for 25 seconds and then boom, don't start blinking. Cause it's on a white background. And
[11173.91s -> 11181.96s]  you like, oh, there's, there's Jesus, right? Or whatever it is. That's what I'm doing. That's
[11181.96s -> 11186.63s]  what happened. That's what's happening right now. Okay. So we've got Dragon's lair two. I don't know
[11186.63s -> 11219.98s]  this one. Should I do this one? Dragon's lair two time warp. I got to change the name of the game.
[11226.01s -> 11229.45s]  I feel like I just woke up. You know, okay. You know, when you stay up all night
[11230.98s -> 11236.97s]  and the sun starts to come up and you, you kind of start to see that you leave your room and there's
[11236.97s -> 11244.89s]  a window and you start to see the sun come up and it's like, that's how I feel right now.
[11246.33s -> 11258.95s]  All right. Hold on. Dragon's lair two. Okay. Look at, okay. I want you to refresh the screen.
[11258.95s -> 11266.71s]  I'll tell you when. So there's no Dragon's lair two, but there is a Dawn Bluth presents Dragon
[11266.71s -> 11273.13s]  lair 20th anniversary special edition. I think it has, it has a two in it. It does have a two,
[11277.43s -> 11295.69s]  I guess. Okay. So let's get to it. Do you want to see any extras? Should I just watch the game?
[11296.17s -> 11304.31s]  No. Okay. This is the animated FMV night. I got to go for it. Director's cut or the original?
[11304.31s -> 11308.79s]  Five lives always. Move beats. We'll take, should I do the move God on this one? Is this one horrible?
[11309.91s -> 11320.44s]  There's no difficulty on this one. Yes. This is so hard. This one is so hard.
[11329.83s -> 11341.96s]  Okay. Original or director's cut? Original? Director's cut. Original. This is,
[11341.96s -> 11353.64s]  this seems pretty contested in chat. Director. Well, I'll do director's cut. Why not? Here we go.
[11376.06s -> 11380.92s]  I got hit so hard on the ground it killed me. That's not good.
[11387.54s -> 11393.59s]  You're destroying your house lady. Why am I, what's the context here? What the
[11393.59s -> 11405.50s]  fuck is happening? Why am I getting thrown out? Kidnapped again. I'm being blamed.
[11418.84s -> 11430.41s]  We're in the dungeon. Leave me alone. Why are you still fighting me in here? You could help me. You
[11430.41s -> 11449.67s]  could be like the player two. Oh my God. Why is there a Star Wars canon here?
[11450.55s -> 11456.97s]  A spell. Give me the key. Hurry. We'll get her back. Defeat of our wizard.
[11458.09s -> 11476.86s]  Who is talking? Um, why are you still here? Okay. Thank God. I got a checkpoint.
[11476.86s -> 11515.30s]  You're gonna start all the way at the beginning. Oh, this is not good.
[11525.51s -> 11534.01s]  Holy shit. This is in the arcade. They probably saw the first one and they were just like,
[11534.01s -> 11539.72s]  you know what? Fuck it. This shit would cost thousands of dollars to beat in the arcade.
[11540.68s -> 11550.82s]  Hopefully you had like a credit card. You need to have two assistants carry the coins
[11552.02s -> 11555.48s]  to help you do this.
[11578.86s -> 11579.42s]  A prisoner.
[11653.29s -> 11654.01s]  Yes. Yeah.
[11663.03s -> 11678.60s]  I've heard this voice actor before. Pretty good jumper laugh. That one not so good.
[11679.88s -> 11690.22s]  You don't ever swing the sword into your own head. I thought it was gonna be left.
[11691.02s -> 11691.50s]  I predicted.
[11718.15s -> 11727.02s]  Talk more. I can't. I can't talk. I can't speak. I can't do it. I can't talk. I can't,
[11727.02s -> 11736.12s]  I can't talk to you. I need to just stare at this. Why is there a Doug soundtrack?
[11736.12s -> 11741.16s]  Okay. Every time there was a transition in Doug, it would do that like,
[11745.22s -> 11793.46s]  is that happening or am I making that up? How's the movie? Because I can't see it. Is this a good
[11793.46s -> 11797.13s]  movie?
[11806.65s -> 11817.18s]  I am. He's not getting better. No, I'm not getting better. We've done almost three and a
[11817.18s -> 11826.36s]  half hours of QTE cut scenes. I need to go get my eyes examined after this.
[11826.36s -> 11836.34s]  This is me. I'm gonna have to get a new prescription.
[11837.30s -> 11840.98s]  Fuck. Jeremy. Goodness. Okay. I'm doing it now.
[11841.86s -> 11844.74s]  Cursor on the screen. Let's get it right in the middle where it belongs.
[11844.74s -> 11850.74s]  Fuck. Let's do it. This is the one.
[11858.94s -> 11864.76s]  That's the guy that does wacko on an animated X. Got it.
[11874.01s -> 11885.58s]  Get her. I hit left when I shouldn't have.
[11913.66s -> 11928.70s]  I swear to God. Okay. Oh dear brother. We're brothers? I missed that part of the story.
[11931.98s -> 11959.30s]  I'm it's the machine is his brother. What is Doug? Okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Let's go.
[12005.16s -> 12036.07s]  What if I just like, oh fuck. Just crush it in my hands. I have to. I'm gonna go like this.
[12042.52s -> 12045.08s]  I'm doing the thing that all of our parents told us to never do.
[12045.80s -> 12048.76s]  But in this one scenario, I think it'll work.
[12081.72s -> 12098.89s]  Oh. Exhaustion. It's QTE exhaustion. Give me a checkpoint or something. Give me a checkpoint.
[12101.16s -> 12125.88s]  It's all right. I'm here. Yes. Good.
[12125.88s -> 12139.62s]  Good. Wait, this is, this is fair. Wait, this is not, this is Alice in Wonderland.
[12145.27s -> 12150.30s]  Stop shooting me with the fucking. All right. Let's go.
[12161.82s -> 12172.98s]  I thought it was gonna be swing again.
[12176.82s -> 12179.94s]  He looks like he's in pain is what somebody said earlier. No, I'm not in pain.
[12181.94s -> 12190.42s]  I am in total focused in locked in mode. It may look like pain, but it's not.
[12204.62s -> 12219.37s]  Get in there. Swing. Kill. I mean, it's, it's beautifully animated. I will say.
[12224.90s -> 12235.54s]  No, don't start at the fucking painting. Don't start at the painting. All the way back at the damn
[12235.54s -> 12247.69s]  painting. How would you do this without a guide? Uh, you just have to be really good at catching
[12247.69s -> 12254.89s]  every flash because notice how the screen flashes. You just have to be ready like flash. And that
[12254.89s -> 12262.66s]  might, I'm not even sure that happens if you turn the guide off.
[12267.72s -> 12273.14s]  That's how you can tell you're getting old. All right. After like sitting here and pressing the
[12273.14s -> 12281.86s]  same keys, the insides of my fingers are liquidating right now. They're being liquidated.
[12282.26s -> 12323.69s]  Oh, I thought it was up. I did it. I'm back outside. Good. I went down a new area. Nimbus length.
[12330.20s -> 12342.74s]  It's blink time. New area of time. Blink. Again, I'm just like laughing at
[12343.30s -> 12398.87s]  visitors. What the fuck is happening? Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. These games are crazy.
[12404.79s -> 12412.18s]  All right. I, oh, damn it. I need to, I wanted to see that one. I want to see if she just like
[12412.18s -> 12419.98s]  put her mouth over my head and just like, Amy, please move the cursor. I can't help it.
[12420.62s -> 12439.21s]  It's just like that. There's so much going on in every scene.
[12440.17s -> 12442.95s]  You could dissect every single one of these scenes.
[12456.17s -> 12457.05s]  Who's talking?
[12457.05s -> 12486.47s]  Eat the apple. She's going to eat the apple. What? That's the beginning.
[12496.89s -> 12509.83s]  You know, it's ridiculous about video games and gaming in general. Let's talk. Let's go over this.
[12510.71s -> 12517.51s]  So this is, this was like QTEs. Oh, wow. It's QTEs. Cutscenes. They react fast.
[12518.63s -> 12525.35s]  We went from this to being able to fail three to four or five of these in a fucking row and have
[12525.35s -> 12529.83s]  nothing happening. When did that happen? We went from one extreme to the next.
[12543.32s -> 12548.12s]  In fact, in a lot of cases, failing QTEs in games doesn't do anything. It's just,
[12548.12s -> 12553.56s]  they added an animation. All right, I gotta focus here. I don't want to do this again.
[12567.77s -> 12589.22s]  What? I'm on a guy's piano now. Is that the mad hatter? Everybody wants to eat you.
[12590.41s -> 12596.49s]  That's something else too. What was with every single fucking character who wants to eat you
[12596.49s -> 12611.16s]  in all these games from 20 years ago? Everybody wanted to just swallow you. Cats, birds, people,
[12612.12s -> 12618.09s]  monsters. It didn't matter. You were dinner for somebody in every single one of these games.
[12625.46s -> 12649.90s]  Oh, I must press left. Why is he up here with the piano? What did he just do?
[12650.70s -> 12657.21s]  Did he just flash the camera? I didn't even see it. I hope not.
[12687.83s -> 12695.82s]  All right, we're good. I have to pee so bad again.
[12700.20s -> 12705.24s]  Okay, let me ask you a question. When you have to pee, I really do feel like this sometimes.
[12705.96s -> 12710.68s]  I'm like processing all the fucking negative energy in my body right now and I'm gonna pee
[12710.68s -> 12735.11s]  it out. I really feel that way sometimes. What do you guys think? Do some Reddit analysis on my urine.
[12739.43s -> 12743.19s]  Okay, I can't look over here because that's where you guys are and you guys are a distraction.
[12743.99s -> 12765.35s]  That was an embarrassing face, I think. Remember, Jeremy, everything you do into that camera
[12766.07s -> 12780.70s]  is is there forever. Damn it. If you type in like, Jerma into Google.
[12783.91s -> 12789.03s]  Jerma985. I think it's still there. There's an image of my face that is one of the, it's like
[12789.03s -> 12835.94s]  the top thing that is always shown is the one where I'm going like, like, what's this mean?
[12835.94s -> 12858.66s]  What's that mean? When did it freeze? Are we good? I missed every single treasure. How's that
[12858.66s -> 12874.78s]  possible? It froze on that face. We didn't, wait, what was the last thing I said? I said that's the
[12874.78s -> 12881.93s]  most searched face. Okay, then I went on to say that that's the most searched face. That's like
[12881.93s -> 12885.53s]  the face that, I think I'm going down again. I don't know, something's going on here. Now,
[12885.53s -> 12892.65s]  that's the most searched face. And the thing is, I have to, when my mother sees that image,
[12897.38s -> 12905.27s]  right? Oh yeah, Jerma985, top 500 streamer, top 50 streamer. Let's look at my, you know,
[12905.27s -> 12910.18s]  I know that because that's all he talks about at Thanksgiving every year. So we all have memorized
[12910.18s -> 12919.96s]  it by now. Top 50 variety streamer, of course. So, you know, they know. And they, that's what
[12919.96s -> 12925.48s]  they have to see when they type in Jerma985. And that's probably the new one. Like, I'm going to
[12925.48s -> 12927.96s]  be honest with you, take a look at that image. Let's let, I'm going to go over this image.
[12928.76s -> 12936.54s]  You want, you want to talk about like fucking the energy that I have. Let's, I want to, I'm
[12936.54s -> 12942.74s]  going to show you this. Look at this shit. Well, we struggled to stay live apparently.
[12945.85s -> 12961.83s]  Here, look at this. Look at how much blood goes up into my brain. You want to know how, like,
[12961.83s -> 12965.51s]  how smart I am, how intelligent I am? It's because this, that, that is carrying
[12966.47s -> 12984.74s]  so much fucking liquid energy all around my body. Let's examine my face. I should have,
[12984.74s -> 12992.73s]  you know, 2020 hindsight, I should have been a runner. Look at this one too. Take a look at that
[12992.73s -> 12997.99s]  one. Look at this one down here, right below my chin. Look at how, look at how huge that one is.
[12998.71s -> 13006.33s]  Look at that. That's taking so much blood up there. That's like a, that's a tube like this thick.
