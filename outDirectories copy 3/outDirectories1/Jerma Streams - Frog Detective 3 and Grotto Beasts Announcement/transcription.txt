[17.46s -> 21.30s]  What up? How are you doing? What's happening?
[21.30s -> 31.54s]  You know, I made a promise back.
[31.54s -> 36.05s]  I want to say in late January.
[36.05s -> 40.22s]  That promise was going to play
[40.22s -> 44.22s]  Frog Detective 3 before the end of February.
[44.22s -> 48.62s]  So I don't have to eat any weird objects.
[48.62s -> 54.12s]  Frog Detective 3 is what's happening today.
[54.12s -> 63.66s]  Make sure I tweet. That's correct.
[63.66s -> 65.66s]  So not just Frog Detective 3.
[65.66s -> 69.03s]  There's going to be something else we're going to talk about today.
[69.03s -> 72.03s]  I know a lot of you have been eagerly, eagerly anticipating
[72.03s -> 76.68s]  any news on Grotto Beasts.
[76.68s -> 81.52s]  And that is exactly what we're going to talk about later tonight.
[81.52s -> 85.52s]  Grotto Beasts tonight is going to go into pre-sale.
[85.52s -> 89.08s]  We're going to go over everything.
[89.08s -> 92.08s]  There's a lot to talk about.
[92.08s -> 95.08s]  I have a presentation for you.
[95.08s -> 101.70s]  We've waited so long tonight.
[101.70s -> 104.94s]  Grotto Beasts goes into pre-sale tonight.
[104.94s -> 108.62s]  Power Point Andy. That's right.
[108.62s -> 115.83s]  Let's freaking go. You know what?
[115.83s -> 119.39s]  I'll give you a let's freaking go.
[119.39s -> 125.24s]  Elden Ring DLC. Did you see that?
[125.24s -> 130.40s]  It's getting kind of crazy out there.
[130.40s -> 134.15s]  Elden Ring DLC got announced as well. I didn't know.
[134.15s -> 137.15s]  Who knows when it's going to be done, but at least they told us it's coming.
[137.15s -> 141.16s]  Hey, this is in development.
[141.16s -> 144.16s]  All of you shut up already.
[144.16s -> 155.27s]  Everybody quiet.
[155.27s -> 159.98s]  Because I've been waiting for that too.
[159.98s -> 162.98s]  Let's see what they do. It's very exciting.
[162.98s -> 168.72s]  Whenever it's done, it's done. Sounds good.
[168.72s -> 171.72s]  We're going to play some Rogue Detective 3.
[171.72s -> 174.72s]  I'm not going to immediately talk about Grotto Beasts.
[174.72s -> 177.72s]  I want enough people to get trickled into the stream.
[177.72s -> 184.21s]  There's a lot of info. You're such a silly guy.
[184.21s -> 191.48s]  What horse did you vote for?
[191.48s -> 194.98s]  Oh, this thing. I didn't know.
[194.98s -> 205.11s]  I didn't do anything. What about Hylix?
[205.11s -> 210.08s]  Then they growled at me.
[210.08s -> 217.38s]  It was play Hylix or break a huge promise I made to chat a month ago.
[217.38s -> 231.38s]  I have to go with the promise.
[231.38s -> 235.70s]  That is frog time. You lied to Europe.
[235.70s -> 238.70s]  I'm operating in the United States of America.
[238.70s -> 242.39s]  The United States of America is where I operate from.
[242.39s -> 246.39s]  It is currently 6 p.m. in the United States of America.
[246.39s -> 250.64s]  What's my favorite song?
[250.64s -> 264.23s]  I don't know. Hylix will be after this.
[264.23s -> 270.27s]  Probably in the next couple of days.
[270.27s -> 274.15s]  Why do you hate Europeans? I don't hate Europeans.
[274.15s -> 277.15s]  I just burped.
[277.15s -> 280.90s]  I'm going to shit my pants right there.
[280.90s -> 283.90s]  Oh, guys. Grotto Beast is coming.
[283.90s -> 286.90s]  I don't have to leave the stream.
[286.90s -> 294.82s]  That would be really funny.
[294.82s -> 297.82s]  Announcement stream. Grotto Beast pre-sales.
[297.82s -> 300.82s]  I have to leave. See you in a week.
[300.82s -> 304.70s]  You better not bad-chest me.
[304.70s -> 310.75s]  I will be furious.
[310.75s -> 313.75s]  I'm not going to delay anymore.
[313.75s -> 317.12s]  If you don't like voices, mute the stream.
[317.12s -> 320.12s]  This is all I'm going to be doing for the next three hours.
[320.12s -> 325.66s]  Is that Elden Ring news?
[325.66s -> 332.81s]  How dare you.
[332.81s -> 343.26s]  Hey, there it is.
[343.26s -> 346.26s]  This is Frog Detective 3 Corruption at Cowboy County.
[346.26s -> 351.42s]  What's going to happen here is
[351.42s -> 354.42s]  there will be about three voices the whole stream.
[354.42s -> 361.94s]  Spread out over probably 10 characters.
[361.94s -> 365.62s]  There's the Frog Detective voice actor back.
[365.62s -> 382.80s]  They were very expensive.
[382.80s -> 385.80s]  I can't find your notebook in my records.
[385.80s -> 394.21s]  Could you please remind me of what it looks like?
[394.21s -> 399.82s]  Oh, I uninstalled the first two games. Does that matter?
[399.82s -> 403.57s]  Is that bad?
[403.57s -> 411.46s]  It's been like a year. What did I do?
[411.46s -> 416.69s]  Did I screw it up?
[416.69s -> 424.01s]  Frog Detective 2, I played like a year and a half ago, didn't I?
[424.01s -> 430.32s]  You've ruined the experience.
[430.32s -> 437.40s]  No, I didn't. I just made it again.
[437.40s -> 441.34s]  You guys aren't cleaning out your PC's computer and shit?
[441.34s -> 448.42s]  You guys aren't cleaning out your PC?
[448.42s -> 451.79s]  If I have not opened an application
[451.79s -> 457.32s]  in at least six months, it goes.
[457.32s -> 470.85s]  I've got to free up that space. No, I don't want that.
[470.85s -> 479.00s]  He won the trophy and a sunflower.
[479.00s -> 507.30s]  I want him to be holding the trophy.
[507.30s -> 516.76s]  I'm happy with that. Looks good.
[516.76s -> 521.92s]  What about the spider? Put a hat on.
[521.92s -> 527.69s]  And a magnifying glass. And a spider.
[527.69s -> 537.38s]  Alright, that's good. I'm done. That's a good book. Yeah.
[537.38s -> 540.62s]  Hey, it's Mary. Remember me?
[540.62s -> 544.05s]  I know it's been a while, so I thought I'd give you a quick recap.
[544.05s -> 547.29s]  After the detective, that's you, solved the case of the invisible wizard
[547.29s -> 551.28s]  a mysterious phone call came in.
[551.28s -> 555.29s]  Well, it wasn't that mysterious. It was the supervisor, as usual.
[555.29s -> 560.43s]  But the contents of the phone call were mysterious, you know.
[560.43s -> 566.87s]  Okay, so let's set the scene. I'm a good actress.
[566.87s -> 573.87s]  Okay, WSD. So it doesn't have my save file.
[573.87s -> 584.58s]  Hello?
[584.58s -> 589.87s]  Oh my gosh, hey, it's me, Detective Frog.
[589.87s -> 592.87s]  Hey, gorgeous, I'm the supervisor. I'm kind of like your boss,
[592.87s -> 596.62s]  but not officially. Oh my gosh, I know.
[596.62s -> 599.80s]  It's so hard to describe a professional relationship.
[599.80s -> 605.76s]  But you're like a helper of sorts. Yes, exactly. Like a manager almost.
[605.76s -> 609.64s]  Yeah. Okay, so I have a new mystery for you. Can you even believe it?
[609.64s -> 613.65s]  Yes, haha. That's my job, to solve mysteries.
[614.65s -> 619.79s]  Classic supervisor. Okay, so what's the case about, babe?
[619.79s -> 623.80s]  I love your enthusiasm, but it's actually really sensitive,
[623.80s -> 628.94s]  so I can't tell you on the phone. Ah, boo.
[628.94s -> 633.26s]  I know, bummer. Makes it so much more exciting, though.
[633.26s -> 638.59s]  For sure, yeah. You do me a huge favor, lovely.
[638.59s -> 643.05s]  Grab your magnifying glass next to the door and head to the train station.
[643.05s -> 647.31s]  There's a ticket for you there. It'll take you on a little trip.
[647.31s -> 651.86s]  Cute. Okay, auto. Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
[651.86s -> 660.67s]  Thanks, love. Later.
[660.67s -> 670.10s]  Great hours. Magnifying glass? Sick.
[670.10s -> 674.56s]  Now I can solve the case. I'm the frog detective.
[674.56s -> 684.82s]  Got your magnifying glass. Good. This game is 100 hours?
[684.82s -> 690.24s]  Damn it. I hate when people just fucking lie to my face.
[690.24s -> 706.58s]  Oh, this is weird. Okay, that's gonna make me puke.
[706.58s -> 709.58s]  Okay, so the detective heads to the train station and it's all so cool.
[709.58s -> 714.23s]  Like there's a new color scheme and stuff. Can you believe it?
[714.23s -> 718.37s]  Someone literally takes the detective's notebook. It's so messed up.
[718.37s -> 722.49s]  Actual tears in my eyes, seriously.
[722.49s -> 726.62s]  I don't think the detective knows about the stolen notebook yet.
[726.62s -> 730.30s]  So, you're actually up to date now.
[730.30s -> 733.30s]  Please, if you could leave a review of my acting skills, I'd super appreciate it.
[733.30s -> 749.05s]  Okay, enjoy the case. Nice. Everybody get ready.
[749.05s -> 765.89s]  Are you guys ready? Oh my god.
[765.89s -> 778.07s]  So what's going on here? What's going on here? Can I ride that?
[778.07s -> 781.07s]  Hello, this is Frog Detective from Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency speaking.
[781.07s -> 786.09s]  How can I help you? Why did you answer the phone like that?
[786.09s -> 789.78s]  What's that supposed to mean, surprise? This is a random phone on the street.
[790.78s -> 795.92s]  I'm the only one here. You don't think it's a little weird?
[795.92s -> 800.49s]  Not really. You're the one making a phone call to a random phone.
[800.49s -> 805.50s]  Because I knew you'd be there. Now who's the weird one?
[805.50s -> 812.56s]  Regardless, I'm glad you picked up. I'm sure you're curious about this mystery.
[812.56s -> 817.00s]  I sure am. Give me the details, please.
[817.00s -> 820.80s]  I cannot. Someone may be listening. What? Who?
[820.80s -> 825.68s]  I saw on the internet that it's possible for strangers to listen to phone calls.
[825.68s -> 829.35s]  Who said that? My cousin wrote all about it on his blog.
[830.35s -> 834.54s]  Okay. Well, if you're not going to tell me details, why did you call?
[834.54s -> 838.98s]  I have a special surprise for you.
[838.98s -> 844.18s]  As you know, the terrain of Cowboy County is vast and rough.
[844.18s -> 847.54s]  I've ordered something special from Whiz Bay to help you get around.
[847.54s -> 853.30s]  Oh, is it a horse? What? No. Why would you say that?
[853.30s -> 859.66s]  It's a cowboy town. What do you mean?
[859.66s -> 864.36s]  Cowboys ride horses. Are you being serious?
[864.36s -> 867.66s]  Horses are valued members of society.
[867.66s -> 871.84s]  It would be demeaning to ride them around. It's messed up that you would even say that.
[871.84s -> 876.79s]  Right. Sorry. I just got confused. Don't worry about it.
[876.79s -> 881.87s]  What did you order, then? A scooter, of course.
[881.87s -> 886.31s]  Sick. Should be next to you in the phone booth.
[886.31s -> 890.45s]  Bold choice to have it shipped to a public phone booth.
[890.45s -> 894.89s]  Please stop questioning my choices.
[894.89s -> 897.89s]  Anyway, when you're ready, pick up the scooter and get some practice in.
[897.89s -> 901.64s]  Lobster Cop arrived early and I will be waiting for you at the town.
[901.64s -> 906.89s]  Just follow the path and meet him and have fun. Hope you have fun, too.
[906.89s -> 914.46s]  I will. All right. See you.
[914.46s -> 924.10s]  Acting, acting, acting, acting, acting. My very own scooter.
[924.10s -> 932.26s]  Sick. Got a scooter.
[932.26s -> 937.42s]  Two out of three voices. You haven't heard the third one yet.
[937.42s -> 946.91s]  You haven't heard the third one yet. Come on. Wait, what?
[946.91s -> 954.70s]  They added... All right, this is interesting. Can I go off like a jump?
[954.70s -> 960.24s]  Frog Detective 3. Cowboy County.
[960.24s -> 964.24s]  Prime or whatever. In the first 10 minutes, he breaks his fucking ankle.
[964.24s -> 976.62s]  That's kind of cool. So where should I go from here?
[976.62s -> 991.42s]  It's actually fun to move around.
[991.42s -> 995.82s]  Superhot Presents. Game by Worm Club.
[995.82s -> 1004.42s]  Consistence from VicScreen. Soundtrack by Dan Golding.
[1004.42s -> 1015.14s]  Starring Lobster Cop.
[1015.14s -> 1019.58s]  All right, I got to get voices for these.
[1019.58s -> 1025.77s]  Suzy Rabbit. German and the Bandits.
[1025.77s -> 1034.82s]  Frog Detective. Plus a special guest.
[1034.82s -> 1054.34s]  What's the mystery? Oh, cool.
[1054.34s -> 1057.34s]  Frog Detective 3. Corruption at Cowboy County.
[1058.34s -> 1070.22s]  Oh, the clapping.
[1070.22s -> 1075.05s]  Theater Kid. You know what?
[1075.05s -> 1078.05s]  Hey, I get to do this at least once every few months.
[1078.05s -> 1088.46s]  All right, come on. All right, moment of truth.
[1088.46s -> 1093.86s]  Well, I...
[1093.86s -> 1098.55s]  Hey, Lobster Cop. I'm here to help solve a mystery.
[1098.55s -> 1102.05s]  Right on time, Detective. I'm known worldwide for my timeliness.
[1102.05s -> 1108.90s]  Is that so? No.
[1108.90s -> 1113.22s]  Can you tell me about the case, Lobster Cop? I sure can.
[1113.22s -> 1116.22s]  We've been sent here to solve the conundrum of the Sheriffless County.
[1116.22s -> 1121.18s]  This town was thriving, Detective.
[1121.18s -> 1124.49s]  Marvel of productivity, friendship, community, and cowboys.
[1124.49s -> 1129.12s]  But there was something missing. The Sheriff?
[1129.12s -> 1136.30s]  Yeah. I was kind of leading up to that.
[1136.30s -> 1139.92s]  My bad. For the sake of storytelling, can you please not interrupt me?
[1139.92s -> 1146.73s]  I sincerely apologize.
[1146.73s -> 1149.73s]  Somebody says Bugleberry?
[1149.73s -> 1153.74s]  That's not Bugleberry?
[1153.74s -> 1156.74s]  Yeah, that's Jimmy Stewart. That's not Bugleberry.
[1156.74s -> 1163.80s]  That's Jimmy Stewart.
[1163.80s -> 1168.75s]  I'm staying with Jimmy Stewart. I don't care.
[1168.75s -> 1173.40s]  So, anyway, I've lost where I was going with this.
[1173.40s -> 1179.25s]  You said there was something missing.
[1179.25s -> 1182.55s]  Right, there was something missing. A sheriff.
[1182.55s -> 1185.55s]  Well, the town had realized that for all these years,
[1185.55s -> 1189.50s]  they were missing a vital ingredient for cowboy living.
[1189.50s -> 1192.93s]  They contacted the supervisor, and he contacted me.
[1192.93s -> 1197.05s]  Anyway, here we are.
[1197.05s -> 1200.48s]  I'm going to be honest, Lobster Cop. The supervisor really hyped this case up.
[1200.48s -> 1204.41s]  Like, there are two of us here.
[1204.41s -> 1208.42s]  To facilitate hiring for a management position?
[1208.42s -> 1211.78s]  Detective, you've read my mind.
[1211.78s -> 1215.60s]  The supervisor really dropped the ball.
[1215.60s -> 1220.66s]  Did you really think I'd need your help?
[1220.66s -> 1224.61s]  No, me neither. And as it turns out, I don't need your help.
[1224.61s -> 1227.61s]  It's kind of turning into Mr. Ed.
[1227.61s -> 1236.85s]  Whatever. The position has been filled.
[1236.85s -> 1241.22s]  Oh, I knew the perfect boy for the job.
[1241.22s -> 1248.61s]  Presenting the new sheriff of Cowboy County.
[1248.61s -> 1252.49s]  Sheriff Mason Mole.
[1252.49s -> 1255.79s]  Well, congratulations on such a speedy resolution, Lobster Cop.
[1255.79s -> 1260.17s]  Thank you.
[1260.17s -> 1265.87s]  Well, I guess I'll head back to the office.
[1265.87s -> 1273.26s]  No, no, no.
[1273.26s -> 1276.80s]  No, no, no.
[1276.80s -> 1281.75s]  No, no.
[1281.75s -> 1286.13s]  No, no, no.
[1286.13s -> 1289.93s]  No, no, no.
[1289.93s -> 1297.87s]  No, you cannot.
[1297.87s -> 1301.56s]  Voice selector.
[1301.56s -> 1304.56s]  Voice one, voice two, voice three, voice one, voice...
[1304.56s -> 1307.56s]  No, it's voice one, voice two, voice three.
[1307.56s -> 1310.56s]  Voice one A, one B, one C. Voice one D, one...
[1310.56s -> 1314.63s]  You know what I mean?
[1314.63s -> 1319.79s]  No, you cannot. Fuck.
[1319.79s -> 1324.68s]  No, you cannot. Is there something you need help with?
[1324.68s -> 1330.08s]  This. What is it, Sheriff Mason Mole?
[1330.08s -> 1334.71s]  Mystery. Prime mystery.
[1334.71s -> 1338.21s]  Please solve this. What's a mystery?
[1338.21s -> 1348.34s]  It's the same fucking person. Hold on.
[1348.34s -> 1352.53s]  All hats have been stolen.
[1352.53s -> 1356.52s]  You're wearing a hat. Not my hat. Town hats.
[1356.52s -> 1359.95s]  Can you elaborate? All the hats in the town have been stolen.
[1359.95s -> 1365.35s]  Please solve this mystery as soon as possible.
[1365.35s -> 1369.47s]  Do you have any leads? No. Get to work, please.
[1369.47s -> 1373.03s]  Well, you heard the sheriff.
[1373.03s -> 1377.84s]  Okay. Is there really no additional information?
[1377.84s -> 1381.77s]  No. But here's your notebook.
[1381.77s -> 1385.58s]  I'm sorry? Here, notebook.
[1385.58s -> 1391.83s]  Somebody mailed it to you. Oh, we got a notebook.
[1391.83s -> 1396.03s]  I didn't even know it was missing.
[1396.03s -> 1401.29s]  Not missing. It's right here.
[1401.29s -> 1407.14s]  Question? No, I'm busy. Goodbye.
[1407.14s -> 1410.82s]  Oh, what a legend.
[1410.82s -> 1414.13s]  You know each other? Sure, but how much can you really know someone, right?
[1414.13s -> 1419.19s]  What? Don't worry about it.
[1419.19s -> 1422.19s]  Now, Detective, as I am the lead investigator on this case,
[1422.19s -> 1426.65s]  I trust you will follow my guidance.
[1426.65s -> 1430.34s]  Oh, I didn't know you were the lead. It's a safe assumption to make.
[1430.34s -> 1435.29s]  Right, of course. So I'll be investigating leads,
[1435.29s -> 1439.66s]  but I could use your assistance. Sure, what do you need?
[1439.66s -> 1443.29s]  I'll handle the motive and the suspects.
[1443.29s -> 1447.30s]  You handle the crime scene and method.
[1447.30s -> 1450.73s]  Okay. It's an easier task for a rookie like you.
[1450.73s -> 1453.97s]  All you need to do is find a map of the crime scene,
[1453.97s -> 1456.97s]  a tool capable of aiding criminal activity,
[1456.97s -> 1459.97s]  a key that could lead us to the clue,
[1459.97s -> 1462.97s]  and lastly, not to mention most importantly,
[1462.97s -> 1466.53s]  a meal for the number one best detective.
[1466.53s -> 1471.53s]  A meal? Yes, Detective.
[1471.53s -> 1474.53s]  Keep up. I'm a very hungry boy and will need sustenance
[1474.53s -> 1478.47s]  to solve the mystery.
[1478.47s -> 1481.47s]  I have some sandwiches I was saving for afternoon, and my name is Otto.
[1481.47s -> 1487.32s]  Tea, if you'd like them. No, I need a proper meal.
[1487.32s -> 1492.66s]  I hear you loud and clear. I'll make sure to get those for you.
[1492.66s -> 1495.66s]  If you need to be reminded of what I want, come and see me by the graveyard.
[1495.66s -> 1499.66s]  It's goofy as well.
[1499.66s -> 1502.66s]  It's goofy and Mr. Ed and, I don't know, a few in there.
[1502.66s -> 1506.54s]  Will do. Good luck, lobster cop.
[1506.54s -> 1514.25s]  I don't need it. Good luck, Detective.
[1514.25s -> 1519.44s]  All right, so we've got to find case three.
[1519.44s -> 1525.16s]  Mystery of the missing hats. Incredibly important.
[1525.16s -> 1530.05s]  Lobster cop. Motive. There's no possible motive
[1530.05s -> 1533.05s]  for lobster cop to do this.
[1533.05s -> 1536.35s]  He wants a crime scene map, criminal tool, key, and a meal.
[1536.35s -> 1540.17s]  Okay, lobster cop, number one best detective. I'm very jealous.
[1540.17s -> 1546.80s]  So tall. That's all we've got on lobster cop right now.
[1546.80s -> 1550.92s]  All right, so we've got to find a crime scene map,
[1550.92s -> 1557.47s]  criminal tool, key, and a meal.
[1557.47s -> 1569.21s]  I'm going this way first. Whoops. Oh, right, I have this.
[1569.21s -> 1587.90s]  No secrets back here or anything? Ooh, wait a minute. What's this?
[1587.90s -> 1591.08s]  Such beautiful flowers. Very spiky looking, too.
[1591.08s -> 1599.18s]  Hmm. TV land Andy.
[1599.18s -> 1608.36s]  A boomerang. It's all coming back to you.
[1608.36s -> 1623.55s]  Snake? A cute snake. Okay, so that's cool. That's up there.
[1623.55s -> 1626.55s]  Okay, so there's a flower up there. I've got to remember that.
[1626.55s -> 1633.94s]  Should I go in here? Okay, I can't go in. All right, here we go.
[1634.94s -> 1639.84s]  Hey. Hey. You.
[1639.84s -> 1644.14s]  Me? Yeah, you. Can you do me a favor?
[1644.14s -> 1648.97s]  Um, it depends on a favor. What?
[1648.97s -> 1651.97s]  I can't just agree to doing you a favor. I don't know who you are.
[1651.97s -> 1655.72s]  I'm Su... What is it? Suzy Rabbit? What is it?
[1655.72s -> 1664.37s]  Is it Sussy Rabbit or Suzy Rabbit? What is it?
[1664.37s -> 1672.01s]  How do I pronounce this? Rip chat. Yeah.
[1672.01s -> 1676.85s]  I think it's... Yeah, no, I got it right.
[1676.85s -> 1681.85s]  I'm Suzy Rabbit. Can you do me a favor?
[1681.85s -> 1684.85s]  You're the best. Thanks. I need you to help me break into this bank.
[1684.85s -> 1691.94s]  What? I will not. Huh?
[1691.94s -> 1695.44s]  Dude, you already agreed to it. I don't appreciate you lying to me.
[1695.44s -> 1699.38s]  If you said you'd do me a favor, you should keep your word.
[1699.38s -> 1703.01s]  I didn't agree to the favor. Oh, so now you're changing the story.
[1703.01s -> 1710.52s]  Whatever, dude. Just leave me alone.
[1710.52s -> 1728.06s]  What the heck? Break into the bank? Excuse me.
[1728.06s -> 1736.73s]  Suzy Rabbit? Hello? It's me. Frog Detective.
[1736.73s -> 1741.60s]  Yeah, I know. They should call you the Flake.
[1741.60s -> 1749.88s]  Why? Because you always flake on your promises.
[1749.88s -> 1753.89s]  I'm going to have to break in on my own now. I don't think that's a good idea.
[1753.89s -> 1758.71s]  Okay, I didn't ask. Why are you breaking in anyways?
[1758.71s -> 1763.22s]  Bit nosy for someone who doesn't want to help. Being nosy is my job.
[1763.22s -> 1767.34s]  Fine. I don't have any IDs so I can't get into my vault.
[1767.34s -> 1772.10s]  Oh, so you only want to steal things that belong to you?
[1772.10s -> 1777.50s]  Yeah. Surely there's another way of getting in there.
[1777.50s -> 1781.17s]  Getting them. Oh, so now you want to help.
[1781.17s -> 1785.05s]  Typical. I just mean, breaking in sounds dangerous.
[1785.05s -> 1788.29s]  Breaking in sounds dangerous. You could get hurt.
[1788.29s -> 1792.10s]  I heard all these banks are booby-trapped. Why?
[1792.10s -> 1796.61s]  So people don't break in. What's wrong with breaking in?
[1796.61s -> 1800.54s]  Well, the point of a bank is to keep valuables safe.
[1800.54s -> 1803.84s]  If people can break in, it kind of defeats the purpose of a bank.
[1803.84s -> 1810.65s]  I'm starting to get it. It's so annoying.
[1810.65s -> 1813.95s]  I have a piece of evidence that's vital to the missing hats case.
[1813.95s -> 1818.65s]  Wait, what? I can really use that.
[1818.65s -> 1823.46s]  Oh, so you will help me. I really shouldn't.
[1823.46s -> 1829.56s]  What kind of evidence? It's a map.
[1829.56s -> 1833.12s]  And I think it might lead to where the hats are hidden.
[1833.12s -> 1836.12s]  I found it this morning, right after the hats were stolen.
[1836.12s -> 1839.12s]  It had big letters on the top that said,
[1839.12s -> 1842.42s]  crime map, eat after reading. I didn't eat it, obviously.
[1842.42s -> 1847.25s]  That's good. Maybe there's another way to get into the vault.
[1847.25s -> 1854.23s]  Can I ask you some questions? All right. Let's go.
[1854.23s -> 1859.44s]  About that vital piece of evidence, the map.
[1859.44s -> 1863.13s]  What about it? What can you tell me about it?
[1863.13s -> 1867.38s]  It was a map of the graveyard, I think.
[1867.38s -> 1871.13s]  Oh, that's helpful. Barely helpful.
[1871.13s -> 1874.13s]  The graveyard is massive. You'd be looking forever
[1874.13s -> 1877.13s]  without some guide to tell you where to go.
[1877.13s -> 1880.75s]  Besides, it's super haunted up there. I wouldn't want to spend too long looking around.
[1880.75s -> 1885.96s]  It's haunted? That's what the rumors say.
[1885.96s -> 1890.34s]  Do you remember anything else about that map? No, not really.
[1890.34s -> 1893.90s]  Listen, if you can help me get into my vault, it's all yours. That sounds like a good deal.
[1893.90s -> 1898.85s]  I'll do my best. Can I ask you some questions?
[1898.85s -> 1904.31s]  Let's brainstorm ideas to get into the vault.
[1904.31s -> 1908.38s]  Oh, sure. What about we kick the bank teller?
[1908.38s -> 1912.74s]  Absolutely not. Joking, obviously.
[1912.74s -> 1916.86s]  Were you? No, I was not.
[1916.86s -> 1921.82s]  Okay, new idea. We'll find your ID.
[1921.82s -> 1925.12s]  I'm going to be honest with you, detective. What is it?
[1925.12s -> 1931.02s]  I'm pretty sure my ID is in the bank vault. Oh, that's a conundrum.
[1931.02s -> 1934.90s]  Yeah, but there's a silver lining. We live in a town
[1934.90s -> 1939.46s]  filled with outlaws. I don't live here.
[1939.46s -> 1943.47s]  You'll know how to make a fake ID. Is that against the rules?
[1943.47s -> 1949.11s]  What rules? Bank rules?
[1949.11s -> 1953.38s]  It's my vault. What are they going to do, ban me from my own possessions?
[1953.38s -> 1957.75s]  I suppose not. Great, so it's settled. You'll get me a fake ID.
[1957.75s -> 1967.38s]  What? No. Suit yourself.
[1967.38s -> 1973.22s]  Theoretically, if I were to help. Yes, thank you.
[1973.22s -> 1977.28s]  I'll wait right here. Thank you, detective. Okay.
[1977.28s -> 1984.15s]  Mind if I ask you some more questions? Okay, so we got to get into the vault.
[1984.15s -> 1991.30s]  We have to get a fake ID. Small enemy survivor.
[1991.30s -> 1997.02s]  I'm destroying you.
[1997.02s -> 2000.19s]  I'm being outclassed in our conversation.
[2000.19s -> 2007.58s]  Okay, short temper.
[2007.58s -> 2011.14s]  Ethical criminal, not a big believer in rules.
[2011.14s -> 2026.84s]  Needs a fake ID, yikes. I need an ID.
[2026.84s -> 2036.61s]  I'll come back in a minute because I have to figure out what you're going to sound like.
[2036.61s -> 2045.38s]  Guys! Guys, look!
[2045.38s -> 2051.02s]  Small enemy. Spider.
[2051.02s -> 2054.02s]  Holy shit, guys, it's the- Small enemy. Spider.
[2054.02s -> 2067.54s]  What the heck? Enemy. I forgot how you talk.
[2114.81s -> 2159.84s]  R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[2159.84s -> 2164.74s]  Okay, Mason Mole, motive.
[2164.74s -> 2169.76s]  Wanted to be the only person in town with a hat. To be left alone, it seems, okay.
[2169.76s -> 2173.96s]  Fellow a few words, previous job helped out.
[2173.96s -> 2189.78s]  Helped out. Interesting.
[2189.78s -> 2201.16s]  Hmm. Hmm. What's this?
[2201.16s -> 2204.40s]  Ooh, these could come in handy. Ah, get it? Handy. Gloves.
[2204.40s -> 2210.62s]  Excuse me. Yes, sheriff? Those are evidence.
[2210.62s -> 2217.28s]  Evidence of what? Crime. Oh, I'll leave them here.
[2217.28s -> 2222.34s]  No. No? Take them. Aren't they evidence?
[2222.34s -> 2228.22s]  Aren't they evidence? Not yet. Cool.
[2228.22s -> 2239.53s]  What? Alright, so I got gloves. Does anybody need gloves?
[2239.53s -> 2255.45s]  I know everybody's waiting for what character is going to be Bernie Sanders and what character is going to be Donald Trump.
[2255.45s -> 2259.45s]  Everyone's waiting. Everyone's like, which one is going to be Bernie Sanders?
[2259.45s -> 2262.45s]  Right? I know. Everyone's waiting for it. But what if I pivot?
[2262.45s -> 2265.82s]  What if it's not Bernie Sanders? Right? What if it's not?
[2265.82s -> 2275.71s]  What if I don't do Bernie Sanders?
[2275.71s -> 2279.71s]  Excuse me, Mr. Satan. Yeah, you guys, you know the drill.
[2279.71s -> 2284.73s]  Okay, am I ready?
[2284.73s -> 2296.54s]  If you're here from the Evil Secret Society, please leave me alone. I'm not interested in joining.
[2296.54s -> 2299.29s]  What's the Evil Secret Society?
[2299.29s -> 2305.01s]  That's right. I know the society's tricks.
[2305.01s -> 2309.76s]  Well, I'm actually here from Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.
[2309.76s -> 2313.58s]  Oh, yeah? Where are your credentials then?
[2313.58s -> 2319.58s]  Well, I'm a detective. I am Frog, and I'm here to solve a mystery slash possible crime.
[2319.58s -> 2323.59s]  Do you have any identification?
[2323.59s -> 2325.54s]  Just my face.
[2325.54s -> 2328.22s]  Do you have identification?
[2328.22s -> 2331.91s]  No, but I'm Craig. Everybody knows me.
[2331.91s -> 2337.28s]  I wouldn't normally believe you, but my appearance does seem to match what you're saying.
[2337.28s -> 2340.03s]  But just know, I don't trust you.
[2340.03s -> 2343.30s]  I wouldn't expect you to. We just met.
[2343.30s -> 2347.05s]  Detective, I'm someone that's regularly messed with.
[2348.05s -> 2352.05s]  There are many different societies around here, and they all want me to join.
[2352.05s -> 2357.35s]  But I'm a lone ranger. I have no interest in being a part of these secret societies.
[2357.35s -> 2360.62s]  What types of secret societies are there?
[2360.62s -> 2365.37s]  For starters, you've got the naughty little guys. They've been after me for years.
[2365.37s -> 2368.74s]  The posties are another one. They go around delivering mail.
[2368.74s -> 2375.86s]  I'm not sure that's a secret society. I think it's more of a public service.
[2375.86s -> 2379.86s]  Then why can't we open everybody's mail? Not so public if you ask me.
[2379.86s -> 2384.55s]  Open your eyes. Another society is the Ghost Spotters League.
[2384.55s -> 2388.01s]  Oh wait, I think I've heard of them.
[2388.01s -> 2392.02s]  Yes, despite being a secret society, they're quite well known.
[2392.02s -> 2397.38s]  To be honest with you, I said earlier that I wasn't interested in being a part of any societies, but that's only half true.
[2397.38s -> 2399.58s]  Oh.
[2399.58s -> 2404.89s]  The Ghost Spotters League is really exclusive, and I'm kind of bummed that they never tried to recruit me.
[2404.89s -> 2408.02s]  Are you a keen ghost spotter?
[2408.02s -> 2416.14s]  Well, that might be the problem. To be inducted into the league, you need to have a... you have to have a spot at the ghost.
[2416.14s -> 2419.78s]  And you haven't seen any?
[2419.78s -> 2423.34s]  Correct. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. You could be anyone.
[2423.34s -> 2426.41s]  I'm the detective.
[2426.41s -> 2433.37s]  It's a compelling disguise, I'll give you that. Do you know much about ghosts?
[2433.37s -> 2441.38s]  Well, I solved a mystery involving one. The mystery of the haunted island. Although, it wasn't haunted in the end.
[2441.38s -> 2448.34s]  So no. You could have saved us both time and just said no.
[2448.34s -> 2453.42s]  Sorry, no. I don't know much about ghosts. Can I ask you some questions?
[2453.42s -> 2455.91s]  Everybody always wants information from me.
[2455.91s -> 2461.35s]  Secret societies.
[2461.35s -> 2469.30s]  This is a sped up Mr. Satan. The only difference is that I don't say Goku at the end.
[2469.30s -> 2478.46s]  I don't suppose there's a secret society that is dedicated to stealing hats.
[2478.46s -> 2486.06s]  Not that I'm aware of. But that's the thing, detective. Those societies run deep. I've barely scratched the surface of what there is to know.
[2486.06s -> 2492.46s]  They run everything. Everywhere you've ever been. Anything you've ever done. It's all dictated by the secret societies.
[2492.46s -> 2494.70s]  Surely that can't be true.
[2494.70s -> 2497.90s]  You'd think not, but it is true.
[2497.90s -> 2499.46s]  How do you know it's true?
[2499.46s -> 2503.72s]  I'm part of several forums dedicated to uncovering the truth.
[2503.72s -> 2504.72s]  Is it a secret forum?
[2504.72s -> 2507.22s]  What?
[2507.22s -> 2511.22s]  Like, is the forum also a secret society?
[2511.22s -> 2516.30s]  I never thought of that. I had to look into it.
[2516.30s -> 2520.13s]  No, I'm just joking.
[2520.13s -> 2523.13s]  I don't see how you can joke about something like this. Secret societies run everything.
[2523.13s -> 2527.33s]  Craig, I just don't think that's true.
[2527.33s -> 2531.58s]  Oh yeah? What evidence do you have that it's not true?
[2531.58s -> 2535.88s]  None, I suppose. Just a lack of evidence of it being true.
[2535.88s -> 2542.86s]  I would say it's more a lack of evidence of it not being true.
[2542.86s -> 2543.86s]  Agree to disagree.
[2543.86s -> 2546.54s]  I'll agree to be right, and you agree to be wrong.
[2546.54s -> 2554.95s]  Okay, sure. How close are you to spotting a ghost?
[2554.95s -> 2558.77s]  What kind of question is that? How am I supposed to know?
[2558.77s -> 2563.14s]  Ghosts aren't cool bugs, detective. You can't just spot them out and about.
[2563.14s -> 2565.40s]  How does it work, then?
[2565.40s -> 2568.02s]  Well, the requirements are pretty flexible.
[2568.02s -> 2571.39s]  Basically, the society needs a credible ghost-citing story.
[2571.39s -> 2574.39s]  Or tangible proof of a ghost, like a photo.
[2574.39s -> 2577.53s]  Do ghosts show up in photos?
[2577.53s -> 2584.39s]  It depends, but yeah. The saloon has a bunch of photos, but I don't want to send in the wrong one and embarrass myself.
[2584.39s -> 2589.27s]  I don't know which ones are of ghosts and which ones are just normal photos.
[2589.27s -> 2592.41s]  Hmm, sounds like a bit of a puzzle.
[2592.41s -> 2598.74s]  They're so strict. If I get my applications denied three times, I'm banned from ever replying again.
[2598.74s -> 2599.74s]  I'm on my second strike.
[2599.74s -> 2603.38s]  What'd you send in the first two times?
[2603.38s -> 2611.21s]  I faked the first two sightings. I dressed up as a ghost and ran really fast, so I looked like a blur in the photograph.
[2611.21s -> 2617.71s]  They're so clever that they figured me out right away. That's how I know they're the real deal.
[2617.71s -> 2620.02s]  I like your creativity, though.
[2620.02s -> 2625.07s]  Thanks. Say, if you happen to have a spot, stop by the saloon.
[2625.07s -> 2628.07s]  Could you take a look and see if you can tell which one of those photos has a ghost in it?
[2628.07s -> 2632.44s]  I don't really care about actually spotting a ghost myself. I just want to be a part of the society.
[2632.44s -> 2637.09s]  I suppose that's fair enough. Sure, I'll have time. I'll take a look.
[2637.09s -> 2648.17s]  Thanks.
[2648.17s -> 2653.11s]  Are there two people doing these voices? Batches.
[2653.11s -> 2665.22s]  Dude, yeah, there is. No, there's only one, dude. There's only one person doing the voice. What the fuck? No fucking way.
[2665.22s -> 2671.66s]  Okay. Wants membership to the secret society. No, wants to the secret hat stealing society.
[2671.66s -> 2674.09s]  Okay, we got to go in the saloon.
[2674.09s -> 2690.01s]  Let's not buy my detective disguised rat. What's going on here? He's cute.
[2690.01s -> 2704.29s]  Oh, hey, Craig. Okay, so find the real photo of a ghost.
[2704.29s -> 2727.98s]  Let me do that now so I don't forget. Do I need a camera?
[2727.98s -> 2736.17s]  Is it in the go? Oh, okay. Wait, wait, wait. I have to prove that one of these has a ghost in it?
[2736.17s -> 2762.46s]  You're killing it right now. Maybe I have to get another item.
[2762.46s -> 2765.70s]  Well, if it isn't the frog of the hour.
[2765.70s -> 2770.51s]  Maybe the frog of one and a half hours, if we're being generous.
[2770.51s -> 2777.81s]  45 minutes if you're speedy. Well, you get what I mean. It's good to see you, detective.
[2777.81s -> 2779.18s]  Have we met?
[2779.18s -> 2785.62s]  Not in person, no. I've sent you several emails asking to illustrate your frog blog.
[2785.62s -> 2787.62s]  Oh, you must be Pistol.
[2787.62s -> 2794.30s]  That's me. Finest artist in all of Cowboy County, and potentially the world.
[2794.30s -> 2796.30s]  Yes, you mentioned that many times in your emails.
[2796.30s -> 2801.24s]  It's a shame we haven't been able to work together. Your stories come to me so visually.
[2801.24s -> 2803.24s]  I'd love to illustrate them.
[2803.24s -> 2808.62s]  I'd love that too. Unfortunately, I do not have a million money to pay you with.
[2808.62s -> 2811.82s]  It's actually two million money.
[2811.82s -> 2813.18s]  Yes, yes, sorry.
[2813.18s -> 2818.81s]  No matter, detective. Simply keep saving up and you'll be able to afford my work one day.
[2818.81s -> 2825.34s]  I'll do that. Are you working on something at the moment?
[2825.34s -> 2830.91s]  Yes, my finest piece yet. It's...
[2832.98s -> 2838.70s]  Well, you see, it's clearly a... Who am I kidding, detective?
[2838.70s -> 2840.70s]  I've lost my artistic touch.
[2840.70s -> 2843.70s]  Well, I'm sure it's just a bit of a creative block.
[2843.70s -> 2853.39s]  Creative block? No. I clicked on a banner on cyberspace and it took me to a strange website.
[2853.39s -> 2854.39s]  What did the banner say?
[2854.39s -> 2859.02s]  Click here for an epic video of a worm who's buff.
[2859.02s -> 2860.02s]  You were right to click it.
[2860.02s -> 2864.21s]  When it loaded, it was just a scary picture of a witch.
[2864.21s -> 2868.28s]  It made a loud cackling noise and the screen just said,
[2868.28s -> 2872.35s]  You just got a curse on you from this website.
[2872.35s -> 2874.35s]  Ever since then, I have lost my artistic talents.
[2874.35s -> 2877.22s]  That's terrible. When did that happen?
[2877.22s -> 2878.78s]  Earlier today.
[2878.78s -> 2882.78s]  I don't mean to doubt you, but are you sure it wasn't just a prank?
[2882.78s -> 2885.73s]  Prank? I don't think so.
[2885.73s -> 2891.36s]  That witch was really scary and I'm normally very brave.
[2891.36s -> 2893.36s]  Did the website have any specifics about the curse?
[2893.36s -> 2894.92s]  No.
[2894.92s -> 2898.86s]  Well, how do you know the curse is on your artistic talents?
[2898.86s -> 2902.94s]  It's been three hours and I haven't found my latest muse.
[2902.94s -> 2904.75s]  A muse?
[2904.75s -> 2907.38s]  You know, a subject that piques my interest.
[2907.38s -> 2911.62s]  Every day I find one and today I haven't seen anything that inspires me.
[2911.62s -> 2914.69s]  Can I ask you some questions?
[2914.69s -> 2916.94s]  Go ahead.
[2916.94s -> 2918.94s]  The worm back there is so fucking cool.
[2918.94s -> 2921.20s]  Alright, you need a muse.
[2921.20s -> 2924.59s]  You mentioned needing a muse.
[2924.59s -> 2926.66s]  I'm cursed to never have one.
[2926.66s -> 2931.30s]  Well, it's only been a few hours. One might show up.
[2931.30s -> 2932.60s]  I doubt it.
[2932.60s -> 2934.60s]  I think this is the end of my painting career.
[2934.60s -> 2939.49s]  Don't give up. What if I can help you find a muse?
[2939.49s -> 2941.24s]  You want to help me?
[2941.24s -> 2944.23s]  I'd love to. Let me think.
[2944.23s -> 2947.24s]  Maybe you could draw me.
[2947.24s -> 2950.63s]  I have no interest in drawing you.
[2950.63s -> 2952.38s]  That's understandable.
[2952.38s -> 2953.62s]  Hmm.
[2953.62s -> 2958.70s]  If you can find me a photograph of something compelling to draw, I would be very grateful.
[2958.70s -> 2961.32s]  But I think it might be too much of a challenge.
[2961.32s -> 2963.94s]  Nothing is too much of a challenge for me.
[2963.94s -> 2967.40s]  What about putting on a hat?
[2967.40s -> 2969.98s]  No comment.
[2969.98s -> 2972.12s]  Your head is a weird shape.
[2972.12s -> 2978.42s]  I know. I'll get to work finding a photograph for you to draw.
[2978.42s -> 2982.04s]  Thank you, detective. I wish you the best of luck.
[2982.04s -> 2983.79s]  Can I ask you something else?
[2983.79s -> 2985.35s]  Go ahead.
[2985.35s -> 2991.92s]  Can you tell me more about the curse from that website you visited?
[2991.92s -> 2994.67s]  I don't know what more there is to say.
[2994.67s -> 2999.23s]  I wanted to see a video of a buff worm and I was tricked, fooled.
[2999.23s -> 3001.73s]  Cyber space can be a really troubling place.
[3001.73s -> 3003.42s]  Everybody warned me.
[3003.42s -> 3006.23s]  On the bright side, I clicked on a banner that said,
[3006.23s -> 3010.54s]  I was the one thousandth visitor and I won a hundred thousand money.
[3010.54s -> 3012.10s]  What? Really?
[3012.10s -> 3013.10s]  Yeah.
[3013.10s -> 3014.91s]  You have the money?
[3014.91s -> 3018.54s]  They just asked for my banking information and I gave it to them.
[3018.54s -> 3020.16s]  You did what?
[3020.16s -> 3023.53s]  Relax. How else was I going to get my prize money?
[3023.53s -> 3025.41s]  It seems really dangerous.
[3025.41s -> 3029.54s]  You're just jealous because I won a hundred thousand money?
[3029.54s -> 3031.91s]  It's already there in my bank account.
[3031.91s -> 3033.60s]  You checked? Really?
[3033.60s -> 3038.92s]  Yeah. I bought this new outfit with my winnings.
[3038.92s -> 3041.16s]  Wow. I'm sorry for doubting you.
[3041.16s -> 3042.46s]  It's fine.
[3042.46s -> 3046.60s]  I guess I'll always click on those banners from now on.
[3046.60s -> 3048.10s]  Sounds like a plan.
[3050.72s -> 3052.66s]  Wait, what?
[3052.66s -> 3054.66s]  All right. So we've got to get something compelling to draw.
[3054.66s -> 3058.32s]  Real.
[3058.32s -> 3064.23s]  Real.
[3064.23s -> 3066.37s]  Okay.
[3071.58s -> 3074.58s]  And some internet safety lessons amuse.
[3074.58s -> 3077.26s]  Two million money is a small price to pay for art.
[3077.26s -> 3078.95s]  Allegedly cursed.
[3078.95s -> 3084.92s]  First, always give your banking information to anyone who asks for it.
[3084.92s -> 3085.92s]  I was...
[3085.92s -> 3086.92s]  Jesus.
[3086.92s -> 3088.54s]  No, do not do that.
[3088.54s -> 3092.41s]  Okay.
[3092.41s -> 3109.26s]  What are you up to?
[3109.26s -> 3110.26s]  Afternoon, detective.
[3110.26s -> 3113.81s]  Afternoon, detective.
[3113.81s -> 3114.81s]  What can I get for you?
[3114.81s -> 3116.24s]  Nothing for me, thanks.
[3116.24s -> 3117.24s]  I'm here on official business.
[3117.24s -> 3119.80s]  Oh, you're about the hats?
[3119.80s -> 3123.10s]  I must look like a heck of a suspect.
[3123.10s -> 3124.66s]  Why is that?
[3124.66s -> 3127.84s]  I'm the only resident of Cowboy County without a hat.
[3127.84s -> 3130.02s]  I mean, until now.
[3130.02s -> 3132.19s]  That's pretty suspicious of me.
[3132.19s -> 3134.19s]  I could have stolen them all out of jealousy.
[3134.19s -> 3138.40s]  And cooked them up in a stew.
[3143.63s -> 3144.63s]  Did you steal...
[3144.63s -> 3149.52s]  Did you steal the hats and cook them up in your stew?
[3149.52s -> 3152.17s]  You bet.
[3152.17s -> 3153.73s]  Oh.
[3153.73s -> 3157.74s]  Everyone, come get your hats stew.
[3157.74s -> 3162.78s]  I'm just pulling your leg, detective.
[3162.78s -> 3163.78s]  I'm a jokester.
[3163.78s -> 3166.40s]  They call me Bantering Bonnie around here.
[3166.40s -> 3169.33s]  That's a nice nickname.
[3169.33s -> 3172.08s]  I'm literally joking.
[3173.64s -> 3175.94s]  They just call me Bonnie.
[3175.94s -> 3178.14s]  I made that up.
[3178.14s -> 3179.14s]  Oh.
[3179.14s -> 3181.34s]  Now you're getting it.
[3181.34s -> 3182.34s]  I'm full of jokes.
[3182.34s -> 3184.10s]  Yeah.
[3184.10s -> 3185.10s]  I get it now.
[3185.10s -> 3186.10s]  Um.
[3186.10s -> 3187.10s]  Anyway, you mentioned that you don't wear a hat.
[3187.10s -> 3188.10s]  Why not?
[3188.10s -> 3192.37s]  My head is a weird shape.
[3192.37s -> 3195.70s]  Ah.
[3195.70s -> 3198.14s]  I'm literally joking.
[3198.14s -> 3201.26s]  My head is completely normal.
[3201.26s -> 3202.26s]  Oh.
[3202.26s -> 3203.50s]  Mine too.
[3203.50s -> 3206.31s]  I just don't like the way hats look with my dress.
[3206.31s -> 3208.74s]  Plus, I'm inside most of the time, so why bother?
[3208.74s -> 3210.92s]  It's not a suspicious thing.
[3210.92s -> 3211.92s]  LOL.
[3211.92s -> 3214.12s]  Okay.
[3214.12s -> 3215.94s]  LOL.
[3215.94s -> 3216.94s]  Hey, detective.
[3216.94s -> 3218.99s]  Yeah?
[3218.99s -> 3222.54s]  I know a lot about Cowboy County.
[3222.54s -> 3223.54s]  I know it all.
[3223.54s -> 3224.97s]  Why are we yelling?
[3224.97s -> 3226.40s]  It's a joke.
[3226.40s -> 3227.40s]  LOL.
[3227.40s -> 3230.02s]  Is it okay if I talk normally?
[3230.02s -> 3233.53s]  Yes, but it was just a joke.
[3233.53s -> 3235.34s]  Okay.
[3235.34s -> 3238.52s]  Anyway, as I was saying, my job here isn't just to run the saloon.
[3238.52s -> 3241.52s]  I'm also a keen historian for Cowboy County.
[3241.52s -> 3245.95s]  Despite my hilarious nature, I take the world very seriously.
[3245.95s -> 3251.14s]  For example, did you know that the graveyard up on the hill is gravely haunted?
[3251.14s -> 3252.14s]  Gravely.
[3252.14s -> 3253.63s]  Sorry?
[3253.63s -> 3255.38s]  Gravely haunted.
[3255.38s -> 3256.38s]  Gravely.
[3256.38s -> 3258.14s]  Graveyard.
[3258.14s -> 3259.50s]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[3259.50s -> 3262.50s]  I have tons of stories and photographs from the haunted hill.
[3262.50s -> 3264.64s]  You can check them out if you want.
[3264.64s -> 3265.64s]  I sure will.
[3265.64s -> 3268.74s]  Thanks.
[3268.74s -> 3269.91s]  LOL.
[3269.91s -> 3270.91s]  I just got the gravely thing.
[3270.91s -> 3276.42s]  Can I ask you a few questions?
[3276.42s -> 3284.64s]  You didn't actually make hat stew, did you?
[3284.64s -> 3285.64s]  Of course not.
[3285.64s -> 3286.88s]  Gross.
[3286.88s -> 3287.88s]  I am making stew, though.
[3287.88s -> 3291.12s]  It's the only way I can think to get the regular customers back.
[3291.12s -> 3293.06s]  Where'd they go?
[3293.06s -> 3297.01s]  Oh, they're around, but I think they got a bit scared off.
[3297.01s -> 3299.95s]  Do you have bandits in the saloon?
[3299.95s -> 3301.96s]  LOL.
[3301.96s -> 3302.96s]  I wish.
[3302.96s -> 3303.96s]  It's worse.
[3303.96s -> 3305.65s]  Artists.
[3305.65s -> 3307.08s]  Artists?
[3307.08s -> 3308.08s]  Creative types.
[3308.08s -> 3310.96s]  That doesn't sound scary at all.
[3310.96s -> 3314.02s]  No, but no.
[3314.02s -> 3315.26s]  You're right.
[3315.26s -> 3316.26s]  It just changes the vibe.
[3316.26s -> 3319.88s]  They hang around all day creating things and finding themselves.
[3319.88s -> 3324.63s]  I miss the rootin' tootin' cowboy bootin' times we used to have.
[3324.63s -> 3325.63s]  You're not a fan of art?
[3325.63s -> 3329.51s]  I like the cartoon section of the newspaper.
[3329.51s -> 3330.51s]  If that counts.
[3330.51s -> 3333.27s]  Sure.
[3333.27s -> 3335.27s]  You just want everyone to party a bit more, right?
[3335.27s -> 3336.70s]  Right.
[3336.70s -> 3341.78s]  Get them to stop taking themselves so seriously.
[3342.78s -> 3345.54s]  Stew.
[3345.54s -> 3346.54s]  Cat stew.
[3346.54s -> 3349.19s]  I'm joking.
[3349.19s -> 3353.57s]  Sorry, I'm still learning about jokes.
[3353.57s -> 3356.57s]  It's just a normal stew, but I'm famous for it around here.
[3356.57s -> 3359.38s]  Lure them here with the stew.
[3359.38s -> 3361.38s]  Keep them here with the party atmosphere.
[3361.38s -> 3365.02s]  Sounds like a great plan.
[3365.02s -> 3366.02s]  I don't have enough ingredients, though.
[3366.02s -> 3368.32s]  Say, could you bring me some carrots?
[3368.32s -> 3370.82s]  I'll give you the cash.
[3370.82s -> 3373.21s]  Sure.
[3373.21s -> 3375.47s]  Got some money.
[3375.47s -> 3378.89s]  She is not joking.
[3378.89s -> 3381.89s]  Oh, and around these parts there's really delicious edible cactus flower.
[3381.89s -> 3384.38s]  Could you collect four for me?
[3384.38s -> 3386.26s]  I guess so.
[3386.26s -> 3390.02s]  I'll give you as much stew as you want in return.
[3390.02s -> 3392.22s]  Sounds like a good deal.
[3392.22s -> 3396.13s]  Okay.
[3396.13s -> 3397.13s]  Wait, what about the ghost photos?
[3397.13s -> 3400.65s]  Do you know much about the photos here in the salo-
[3400.65s -> 3401.65s]  Whoa!
[3401.65s -> 3402.65s]  Acting.
[3402.65s -> 3407.96s]  Do you know much about the photos here in the saloon?
[3407.96s -> 3410.71s]  Legend has it they're haunted.
[3410.71s -> 3415.21s]  I don't know if I believe it, but you're welcome to take a look at them and I'll tell you what I know.
[3415.21s -> 3416.77s]  Sure, thanks.
[3416.77s -> 3418.77s]  Can I ask you some questions about this case?
[3418.77s -> 3419.94s]  Don't have any more.
[3419.94s -> 3428.03s]  Okay, so what do I do with-
[3428.03s -> 3436.59s]  I gotta look at the photos?
[3436.59s -> 3447.51s]  Hearing your actual voice is so jarring.
[3447.51s -> 3454.42s]  Audio book Andy.
[3454.42s -> 3457.73s]  Okay, so let's- I mean, we've got some tasks.
[3457.73s -> 3465.62s]  This one is standing in front of a graveyard that's totally haunted behavior.
[3465.62s -> 3467.50s]  Maybe she's mourning.
[3467.50s -> 3468.50s]  Did you ever think of that?
[3468.50s -> 3471.18s]  Then why is she smiling?
[3471.18s -> 3473.70s]  Yeah, good point.
[3473.70s -> 3475.70s]  Actually, I know who that is.
[3475.70s -> 3479.94s]  That's Betsy, one of the first shop owners here in Cowboy County.
[3479.94s -> 3483.18s]  She sold all these gravestones to residents of the town.
[3483.18s -> 3486.18s]  I suspect that's why she has such a big smile on her face.
[3486.18s -> 3489.26s]  Smile of a clever businesswoman.
[3489.26s -> 3490.94s]  Not haunted.
[3490.94s -> 3493.44s]  Not haunted, okay, thanks.
[3493.44s -> 3496.09s]  Okay.
[3496.09s -> 3502.83s]  Is this a ghost?
[3502.83s -> 3504.65s]  Who, Mark?
[3504.65s -> 3508.04s]  Ha ha ha ha!
[3508.04s -> 3510.28s]  No, I wish Mark was a ghost.
[3510.28s -> 3512.16s]  What?
[3512.16s -> 3515.04s]  That didn't come out right, lol.
[3515.04s -> 3517.79s]  Oh, that's my ex-husband.
[3517.79s -> 3519.67s]  Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.
[3519.67s -> 3522.42s]  Why did you get divorced?
[3522.42s -> 3526.12s]  Seems like a pretty personal question.
[3526.12s -> 3528.64s]  My bad.
[3528.64s -> 3530.01s]  Ha ha ha!
[3530.01s -> 3531.01s]  I'm just kidding.
[3531.01s -> 3532.01s]  He's not really my ex-husband.
[3532.01s -> 3535.01s]  I actually don't know who that is, but I called him Mark.
[3535.01s -> 3537.01s]  I think that photo is over 50 years old.
[3537.01s -> 3541.27s]  Take my word for it though, that's not a haunted photo.
[3541.27s -> 3542.27s]  It has nice energy.
[3542.27s -> 3543.27s]  Okay.
[3543.27s -> 3545.41s]  What?
[3545.41s -> 3554.31s]  This one's super spooky.
[3554.31s -> 3556.31s]  Surely it has to be a ghost photo.
[3556.31s -> 3559.06s]  That's old Snappy Fresh.
[3559.06s -> 3563.06s]  He was one of the original gold miners here in town about 100 years ago.
[3563.06s -> 3564.94s]  Wow.
[3564.94s -> 3566.38s]  It's so old and creepy.
[3566.38s -> 3569.68s]  It totally fits the description I'm looking for.
[3569.68s -> 3572.43s]  Yeah, well, you're out of luck.
[3572.43s -> 3574.25s]  Oh.
[3574.25s -> 3576.74s]  Old Snappy Fresh is still alive.
[3576.74s -> 3577.92s]  How could he be a ghost?
[3577.92s -> 3579.80s]  He's still alive?
[3579.80s -> 3580.80s]  How old is he?
[3580.80s -> 3584.55s]  It's impolite to ask an old person's age.
[3584.55s -> 3587.05s]  He's 130 years old.
[3587.05s -> 3589.06s]  How do you know?
[3589.06s -> 3590.55s]  I asked.
[3590.55s -> 3593.55s]  Coincidentally, that's how I learned it was rude to ask someone's age.
[3593.55s -> 3595.50s]  Oh, okay.
[3595.50s -> 3596.50s]  Thanks.
[3596.50s -> 3604.06s]  Do I have to decide which one is haunted or maybe she'll just tell me eventually?
[3604.06s -> 3608.57s]  Oh, I like this one.
[3608.57s -> 3609.57s]  I hope it's not haunted.
[3609.57s -> 3611.32s]  Bad luck, detective.
[3611.32s -> 3614.50s]  This is the most haunted photo of all.
[3614.50s -> 3616.18s]  Why?
[3616.18s -> 3619.62s]  Legend has it this rabbit was a real mean guy.
[3619.62s -> 3625.50s]  He would put banana peels out for people to trip on, give people wedgies, you name it.
[3625.50s -> 3626.50s]  That's horrible.
[3626.50s -> 3628.68s]  Yeah.
[3628.68s -> 3629.98s]  Wait.
[3629.98s -> 3631.16s]  Sorry.
[3631.16s -> 3632.34s]  I'm thinking of someone else.
[3632.34s -> 3633.34s]  How embarrassing.
[3633.34s -> 3634.34s]  No.
[3634.34s -> 3636.34s]  This guy was the sheriff about 80 years ago.
[3636.34s -> 3639.41s]  A great sheriff loved by all.
[3639.41s -> 3640.71s]  They're not haunted.
[3640.71s -> 3642.34s]  Nope.
[3642.34s -> 3646.65s]  Sorry.
[3646.65s -> 3647.65s]  All good.
[3647.65s -> 3654.65s]  She's literally joking.
[3654.65s -> 3656.66s]  Is this a ghost?
[3656.66s -> 3657.66s]  I doubt it.
[3657.66s -> 3661.33s]  That's a photo of a visitor from about a year ago.
[3661.33s -> 3664.33s]  They came in and changed all the colors in Cowboy County.
[3664.33s -> 3665.33s]  Really weird and messy.
[3665.33s -> 3668.41s]  Fun though.
[3668.41s -> 3669.41s]  And they're still alive.
[3669.41s -> 3671.22s]  I sure hope so.
[3671.22s -> 3672.98s]  Thanks.
[3672.98s -> 3675.75s]  Huh.
[3675.75s -> 3677.50s]  Wait a minute.
[3677.50s -> 3680.09s]  What's going on here?
[3680.09s -> 3702.82s]  Is it?
[3702.82s -> 3710.78s]  I think we found the ghost.
[3710.78s -> 3715.60s]  What about this one?
[3715.60s -> 3718.95s]  Wait.
[3718.95s -> 3720.13s]  Was this one here before?
[3720.13s -> 3721.13s]  Hmm.
[3721.13s -> 3723.89s]  I don't remember.
[3723.89s -> 3727.06s]  There's such a strange energy to it.
[3727.06s -> 3728.43s]  Yeah.
[3728.43s -> 3730.43s]  I suddenly feel really chilly when I look at it.
[3730.43s -> 3733.25s]  He's handsome yet cold.
[3733.25s -> 3736.58s]  Like he's seen too much.
[3736.58s -> 3738.58s]  A man who has lived a thousand lives.
[3738.58s -> 3741.14s]  There's a kindness to him.
[3741.14s -> 3744.40s]  But also a great mystery.
[3744.40s -> 3745.40s]  Bonnie?
[3745.40s -> 3746.70s]  Yes, detective.
[3746.70s -> 3749.01s]  I think this is a haunted photo.
[3749.01s -> 3751.76s]  I think you might well be right.
[3751.76s -> 3753.32s]  May I take it?
[3753.32s -> 3754.88s]  Please do.
[3754.88s -> 3755.88s]  I'll be glad to be rid of it.
[3755.88s -> 3757.76s]  All right.
[3757.76s -> 3759.32s]  We got the photo.
[3759.32s -> 3760.32s]  Sick.
[3760.32s -> 3761.32s]  Got the photo.
[3761.32s -> 3766.66s]  Sick.
[3766.66s -> 3767.66s]  Okay.
[3767.66s -> 3774.02s]  So who wanted the ghost picture?
[3774.02s -> 3775.02s]  Fake ID.
[3775.02s -> 3777.09s]  Oh, it was you.
[3777.09s -> 3778.09s]  Okay.
[3778.09s -> 3779.09s]  Proof of a ghost.
[3779.09s -> 3780.09s]  Craig.
[3780.09s -> 3786.05s]  Very nice.
[3786.05s -> 3787.05s]  All right.
[3787.05s -> 3795.90s]  Look what I got.
[3795.90s -> 3802.50s]  Can I ask you some questions?
[3802.50s -> 3803.74s]  Here's the ghost pic.
[3803.74s -> 3811.07s]  So I took a look at all the photos in the saloon, and I think this one is definitely a ghost.
[3811.07s -> 3812.07s]  Oh, really?
[3812.07s -> 3813.07s]  How do you know?
[3813.07s -> 3816.89s]  Bonnie helped me out by telling me the stories of all the photos.
[3816.89s -> 3821.06s]  The rest of the photos seem pretty normal, but this one is something else.
[3821.06s -> 3823.56s]  I can just tell.
[3823.56s -> 3825.56s]  The energy from this photo is very spooky and suspicious.
[3825.56s -> 3829.25s]  I should have known right away, but I suppose I can only be so smart.
[3829.25s -> 3832.88s]  I suppose that's true.
[3832.88s -> 3834.88s]  Is it okay if I take a photocopy of this?
[3834.88s -> 3836.76s]  That's fine.
[3836.76s -> 3840.26s]  Hopefully this is enough proof for the Ghost Spotters League to finally let me in.
[3840.26s -> 3843.33s]  If they don't, it's their loss.
[3843.33s -> 3844.70s]  Thanks.
[3844.70s -> 3848.37s]  Hey, can I give you something for all your help?
[3848.37s -> 3850.12s]  What do you have?
[3850.12s -> 3851.68s]  A pickaxe.
[3851.68s -> 3854.14s]  Why?
[3854.14s -> 3855.76s]  Sorry?
[3855.76s -> 3858.54s]  Why do you have a pickaxe?
[3858.54s -> 3859.54s]  What's it to you?
[3859.54s -> 3864.30s]  Can't I just carry around a pickaxe?
[3864.30s -> 3866.66s]  Is there something wrong with that?
[3866.66s -> 3868.99s]  No, I guess not.
[3868.99s -> 3873.23s]  But usually when people give stuff to me, they have some reason for having it in the first place.
[3873.23s -> 3876.30s]  Do people give stuff to you often?
[3876.30s -> 3878.06s]  Yeah, pretty often.
[3878.06s -> 3879.06s]  Okay.
[3879.06s -> 3882.62s]  Well, I don't really have an explanation for the pickaxe thing.
[3882.62s -> 3883.62s]  Sorry.
[3883.62s -> 3885.50s]  That's okay, I guess.
[3885.50s -> 3889.57s]  Just one more mystery that will haunt me for the rest of my days.
[3889.57s -> 3892.26s]  That seems really intense.
[3892.26s -> 3893.26s]  It's just a pickaxe.
[3893.26s -> 3894.94s]  For you, maybe.
[3894.94s -> 3896.63s]  Whatever.
[3896.63s -> 3898.00s]  Thanks for the pickaxe.
[3898.00s -> 3901.42s]  Progress.
[3901.42s -> 3906.69s]  Progress.
[3906.69s -> 3914.33s]  Okay.
[3914.33s -> 3915.50s]  So what do I do with the pickaxe?
[3915.50s -> 3922.31s]  Progress.
[3922.31s -> 3924.77s]  All right.
[3924.77s -> 3925.77s]  So wait.
[3925.77s -> 3926.77s]  Should I get that flower?
[3926.77s -> 3928.20s]  Can I even get...
[3928.20s -> 3929.20s]  Wait, can I get the flower with the pickaxe?
[3929.20s -> 3938.38s]  Where was that flower?
[3938.38s -> 3956.06s]  All right.
[3956.06s -> 3957.06s]  Wait.
[3957.06s -> 3968.59s]  Okay.
[3968.59s -> 3977.13s]  That's a good view.
[3977.13s -> 3987.26s]  Can I not get up there?
[3987.26s -> 3992.54s]  Just checking.
[3992.54s -> 3993.54s]  Do I do anything with the snakes?
[3993.54s -> 4006.13s]  I want to see the scorpion.
[4006.13s -> 4008.39s]  Cool.
[4008.39s -> 4011.17s]  Cool.
[4011.17s -> 4012.17s]  Very cool.
[4012.17s -> 4013.17s]  It's a small scorpion.
[4013.17s -> 4014.73s]  Ooh.
[4014.73s -> 4015.73s]  Look, look, look, look, look.
[4015.73s -> 4017.10s]  Is it...
[4017.10s -> 4021.98s]  Can I jump?
[4021.98s -> 4022.98s]  Okay.
[4022.98s -> 4023.98s]  That's one prickly cactus.
[4023.98s -> 4024.98s]  Good thing I have these gloves.
[4024.98s -> 4025.98s]  Ooh.
[4025.98s -> 4029.08s]  All right.
[4029.08s -> 4037.04s]  So this one.
[4037.04s -> 4040.78s]  I need to get a couple more.
[4040.78s -> 4041.78s]  The other one was back here.
[4041.78s -> 4052.10s]  Wasn't it?
[4052.10s -> 4053.10s]  Where was the other one?
[4053.10s -> 4055.30s]  Oh, it's over here.
[4055.30s -> 4058.78s]  You missed it?
[4058.78s -> 4064.82s]  I did?
[4064.82s -> 4065.82s]  Next to the entrance.
[4065.82s -> 4066.82s]  You goofy streamer.
[4066.82s -> 4069.98s]  Past it?
[4069.98s -> 4081.29s]  And the other one's back behind there.
[4081.29s -> 4083.94s]  Goofy streamer.
[4083.94s -> 4085.06s]  I mean, I...
[4085.06s -> 4093.66s]  That's true.
[4093.66s -> 4094.66s]  Okay.
[4094.66s -> 4095.66s]  And the last one...
[4095.66s -> 4096.66s]  Is there only four?
[4096.66s -> 4097.66s]  Or is there more than four?
[4097.66s -> 4100.24s]  I don't know.
[4100.24s -> 4111.38s]  Four.
[4111.38s -> 4112.38s]  That should be enough flowers.
[4112.38s -> 4115.93s]  All right.
[4115.93s -> 4125.12s]  We are getting very close to talk about and show Grotto Beasts.
[4125.12s -> 4134.83s]  We are moments away, I would say.
[4134.83s -> 4136.17s]  We haven't heard Bernie yet.
[4136.17s -> 4138.56s]  You can't.
[4138.56s -> 4139.56s]  Hold on.
[4139.56s -> 4140.56s]  Hold on.
[4140.56s -> 4143.78s]  Hold on a little bit.
[4143.78s -> 4144.78s]  Okay.
[4144.78s -> 4146.15s]  Let...
[4146.15s -> 4147.97s]  This is...
[4147.97s -> 4148.97s]  So, this...
[4148.97s -> 4149.97s]  Okay.
[4149.97s -> 4152.23s]  Oh.
[4152.23s -> 4153.60s]  Wow.
[4153.60s -> 4156.94s]  Look at you.
[4156.94s -> 4157.94s]  Huh?
[4157.94s -> 4158.94s]  Your jumper.
[4158.94s -> 4160.30s]  Your vacant smile.
[4160.30s -> 4161.80s]  Those piercing eyes.
[4161.80s -> 4165.22s]  Are you a model by any chance?
[4165.22s -> 4168.50s]  I certainly am not.
[4168.50s -> 4171.99s]  Maybe it's time to start modeling.
[4171.99s -> 4173.49s]  Maybe.
[4173.49s -> 4178.53s]  Maybe it's time to solve a mystery.
[4178.53s -> 4181.13s]  That does not sound like that person I'm trying to do.
[4181.13s -> 4183.90s]  But yeah.
[4183.90s -> 4188.69s]  Actually, I don't know what you mean.
[4188.69s -> 4189.69s]  I'm a detective.
[4189.69s -> 4192.32s]  Ah.
[4192.32s -> 4194.42s]  Is there a problem?
[4194.42s -> 4195.42s]  I don't want any trouble.
[4195.42s -> 4198.18s]  I'm an outlaw, you see.
[4198.18s -> 4199.54s]  My name is Sherman.
[4199.54s -> 4204.90s]  Authority and I don't always see eye to eye.
[4204.90s -> 4207.82s]  I have no authority at all.
[4207.82s -> 4215.36s]  You have the authority to steal my heart.
[4215.36s -> 4216.36s]  Because of your good looks.
[4216.36s -> 4219.95s]  Yeah.
[4219.95s -> 4222.70s]  It's just a little joke.
[4222.70s -> 4223.70s]  Not about your looks.
[4223.70s -> 4225.38s]  You look great.
[4225.38s -> 4230.87s]  It was like you could like steal my heart because you're so dashing.
[4230.87s -> 4231.87s]  Yeah.
[4231.87s -> 4232.87s]  You're too kind.
[4232.87s -> 4234.50s]  Anyway.
[4234.70s -> 4237.93s]  How can I help you, detective?
[4237.93s -> 4240.27s]  I'm here about the missing hats.
[4240.27s -> 4241.27s]  The missing hearts?
[4241.27s -> 4245.42s]  You've stolen them.
[4245.42s -> 4246.42s]  Sorry.
[4246.42s -> 4247.42s]  Just joking.
[4247.42s -> 4249.62s]  Maybe not the time for my killer sense of humor.
[4249.62s -> 4250.62s]  The hats.
[4250.62s -> 4251.62s]  Right.
[4251.62s -> 4252.62s]  Of course.
[4252.62s -> 4253.62s]  The hats.
[4253.62s -> 4254.62s]  Mine was stolen.
[4254.62s -> 4256.69s]  Do you have any leads?
[4256.69s -> 4257.69s]  Who doesn't?
[4257.69s -> 4258.69s]  That's what I'm here to figure out.
[4258.69s -> 4261.60s]  Did you see anything suspicious over the last couple of days?
[4261.60s -> 4265.46s]  I looked in a mirror.
[4265.46s -> 4269.03s]  I'm suspicious looking because I'm an outlaw.
[4269.03s -> 4271.23s]  Oh.
[4271.23s -> 4273.05s]  Hmm.
[4273.05s -> 4277.93s]  Honestly, I'm a bit confused on how this new sheriff came into the picture.
[4277.93s -> 4282.95s]  My fellow outlaw, Rhonda Dynamite, was working up the courage to ask to be the new sheriff.
[4282.95s -> 4287.87s]  Clearly, she did not get the courage in time because this new guy, Mason Mole, wanted in
[4287.87s -> 4288.87s]  like he owns the place.
[4288.87s -> 4291.39s]  You don't like him?
[4291.39s -> 4293.34s]  Oh, don't get me wrong.
[4293.34s -> 4294.34s]  He's okay.
[4294.34s -> 4297.62s]  I just don't know why he wants to be the sheriff.
[4297.62s -> 4300.22s]  Cowboy County has always been a lawless land.
[4300.22s -> 4303.10s]  That's the way we like it.
[4303.10s -> 4306.46s]  Everybody respects and understands each other here, so I thought it would be better if the
[4306.46s -> 4307.46s]  sheriff was one of us.
[4307.46s -> 4312.89s]  I'm not saying he'll do a bad job or anything, but I just hope he keeps the county as kind
[4312.89s -> 4315.98s]  as it ever was.
[4315.98s -> 4324.75s]  You're turning into Christopher Walken, am I?
[4324.75s -> 4327.74s]  Have you spoken to him much?
[4327.74s -> 4330.62s]  He's barely said two- No, that's not Walken.
[4330.62s -> 4332.57s]  Come on.
[4332.57s -> 4334.87s]  He's barely said two words the whole time he's been here.
[4334.87s -> 4336.41s]  I assume he's shy.
[4336.41s -> 4337.93s]  So I'll give him the time to settle in.
[4337.93s -> 4339.62s]  But I don't know.
[4339.62s -> 4344.79s]  It can't be strange when someone new comes into your community.
[4344.79s -> 4347.75s]  I really want to be as welcoming as possible, but I have a few concerns.
[4347.95s -> 4350.73s]  Can I ask you some questions about the case?
[4350.73s -> 4355.81s]  We got the pickaxe.
[4355.81s -> 4357.62s]  Please do Walken.
[4357.62s -> 4359.63s]  No.
[4359.63s -> 4362.47s]  I have talked about this before.
[4362.47s -> 4370.04s]  You cannot do a Walken unless you can absolutely do a Christopher Walken.
[4370.04s -> 4371.98s]  There is no attempting to do a Walken.
[4371.98s -> 4377.72s]  You either do it and nail it or not at all.
[4377.72s -> 4381.46s]  The people that can do Walken, they do it phenomenally.
[4381.46s -> 4385.62s]  Everybody else kind of, wow, it just goes like, no, no, no, no, no.
[4385.62s -> 4390.53s]  You don't attempt a Walken unless you do a Walken.
[4390.53s -> 4391.73s]  You know what I'm saying?
[4391.81s -> 4396.09s]  You do not do that.
[4396.09s -> 4397.89s]  Any reason why you're hanging out by the mines?
[4397.89s -> 4402.42s]  Well, yeah, I heard there's gold in there.
[4402.42s -> 4403.92s]  Wow.
[4403.92s -> 4405.93s]  I really like gold.
[4405.93s -> 4410.38s]  I don't mean to sound insensitive, but I want to ask, is it a thing for sloths to like
[4410.38s -> 4411.87s]  gold?
[4411.87s -> 4413.69s]  Why do you ask?
[4413.69s -> 4416.01s]  My friend Martin is a sloth and he loves gold.
[4416.01s -> 4418.43s]  He made a crown out of it.
[4418.43s -> 4419.80s]  Sounds heavy.
[4419.80s -> 4421.36s]  Yeah.
[4421.36s -> 4424.16s]  Well, I haven't really thought about it before, but yes, I think sloths do like gold.
[4424.16s -> 4425.16s]  But then again, who doesn't?
[4425.16s -> 4429.91s]  I find it doesn't suit my complexion.
[4429.91s -> 4431.95s]  I think anything would suit your complexion.
[4432.11s -> 4437.70s]  But anyway, I'm trying to get into the mine, but it's all blocked up.
[4437.70s -> 4442.02s]  Dang, have you tried exploding it with a tiny bit of burp?
[4442.02s -> 4444.54s]  Mate?
[4444.54s -> 4446.74s]  What?
[4446.74s -> 4447.74s]  That sounds really dangerous.
[4447.74s -> 4452.12s]  I was thinking more along the lines of a pickaxe.
[4452.12s -> 4453.92s]  Oh, that was gross.
[4453.92s -> 4454.92s]  Oh, whatever.
[4454.92s -> 4458.17s]  Oh, that would probably be better, yeah.
[4458.17s -> 4459.17s]  Do you have one?
[4459.17s -> 4461.17s]  I can trade you for a shovel?
[4461.17s -> 4462.98s]  I'll think about it.
[4462.98s -> 4465.86s]  Do you mind if I ask you some questions about the case?
[4465.86s -> 4472.25s]  Should we get info first?
[4472.25s -> 4475.26s]  Why are you so suspicious of Mason Moe?
[4475.26s -> 4477.26s]  It's not like me to be suspicious, really.
[4477.26s -> 4479.52s]  You know me.
[4480.55s -> 4483.33s]  Not yet.
[4484.33s -> 4487.21s]  Anyway, I just really don't understand his motives.
[4487.21s -> 4490.15s]  Why is he here?
[4490.15s -> 4491.15s]  I'm not so sure.
[4491.15s -> 4497.27s]  Obviously, I want to trust lobster cop's judgment, but this new guy is quiet and shady.
[4497.27s -> 4500.28s]  Do you even know what job he did before this?
[4500.28s -> 4501.28s]  I have no idea.
[4501.28s -> 4502.78s]  Do you know?
[4502.78s -> 4504.14s]  No.
[4504.14s -> 4505.51s]  Figures.
[4505.51s -> 4508.29s]  Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
[4508.29s -> 4512.26s]  Well, let's complete it right here.
[4512.26s -> 4514.88s]  You mentioned you wanted a pickaxe, right?
[4514.88s -> 4516.57s]  Sure did.
[4516.57s -> 4518.57s]  I have one here if you'd be willing to trade it for the shovel.
[4518.57s -> 4520.19s]  Oh, I'd love that.
[4520.19s -> 4521.37s]  Thanks.
[4521.37s -> 4523.37s]  I could also trade for a nice dinner.
[4523.37s -> 4524.61s]  Just you and I.
[4524.61s -> 4527.55s]  I'll take the shovel for now.
[4527.55s -> 4529.50s]  The offer's open.
[4529.50s -> 4532.06s]  Maybe after I've solved the case.
[4532.06s -> 4533.81s]  Okay.
[4533.81s -> 4541.90s]  Alright, there you go.
[4541.90s -> 4542.90s]  I did Bernie.
[4542.90s -> 4544.90s]  I did my terrible Bernie impression.
[4544.90s -> 4552.32s]  Alright, are you guys ready?
[4552.32s -> 4553.32s]  Are you guys ready to go over this?
[4553.32s -> 4555.69s]  This has been like two years coming.
[4555.69s -> 4558.76s]  Are you ready to talk about this for a little bit?
[4558.76s -> 4563.58s]  We'll come back.
[4563.58s -> 4564.58s]  We'll finish this tonight.
[4564.58s -> 4566.58s]  We'll just want to take a little bit of time to go over it.
[4566.58s -> 4572.88s]  I don't know.
[4572.88s -> 4573.88s]  I found it difficult to pay attention.
[4573.88s -> 4574.88s]  Those eyes.
[4574.88s -> 4578.77s]  Pickaxe to break into the mine.
[4578.77s -> 4579.77s]  Okay, so I got a shovel.
[4579.77s -> 4583.54s]  Alright, I am going to take a quick BRB.
[4583.54s -> 4585.54s]  When I come back, we're going to go over grotto beasts.
[4585.54s -> 4588.42s]  Those of you that are asking, what is that?
[4588.42s -> 4590.79s]  You will see very shortly.
[4590.79s -> 4595.45s]  So, here we go.
[4595.45s -> 4596.45s]  I will be right back.
[4596.45s -> 4776.23s]  Alrighty.
[4776.23s -> 4779.33s]  Hello.
[4779.33s -> 4780.33s]  Are we ready to look at this?
[4780.33s -> 4789.29s]  Hold on, let me just say something.
[4789.29s -> 4796.11s]  Yeah, we're kind of corroborating when the store is going to go up.
[4796.11s -> 4798.80s]  So, give us just a second or two.
[4798.80s -> 4804.75s]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[4804.75s -> 4810.60s]  It's time.
[4810.60s -> 4812.74s]  You've waited long enough.
[4812.74s -> 4822.87s]  Okay, hold on.
[4822.87s -> 4823.87s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[4823.87s -> 4828.18s]  Alright, here we go.
[4828.18s -> 4830.81s]  Let's go over grotto beasts.
[4830.81s -> 4831.81s]  Are you ready?
[4831.81s -> 4834.26s]  I hope so.
[4834.26s -> 4838.54s]  So, for those that have no idea what's going on.
[4838.54s -> 4845.15s]  A couple of years ago, we did a stream called The Wonders of Archaeology.
[4845.15s -> 4853.98s]  In that stream, I opened up card packs from a game, a fake game that we made up.
[4853.98s -> 4863.38s]  And a couple of years later, I am pleased to announce to you that as of tonight,
[4863.38s -> 4870.66s]  free sales are open and you can actually get the real thing.
[4871.66s -> 4874.70s]  Aw, dude, Elden Ring!
[4874.70s -> 4875.70s]  No, it's not Elden Ring.
[4875.70s -> 4878.22s]  So, let's go.
[4878.22s -> 4880.46s]  Are you ready for the presentation?
[4880.46s -> 4882.40s]  Here comes the presentation.
[4891.13s -> 4892.13s]  I'm just going to go through this.
[4892.13s -> 4893.13s]  I'm going to read.
[4893.13s -> 4895.13s]  There's a lot of stuff to read.
[4895.13s -> 4896.43s]  So, just be aware.
[4896.43s -> 4899.80s]  This is going to be like a presentation stream.
[4899.80s -> 4901.68s]  So, what is it?
[4901.68s -> 4907.05s]  It's a physical trading card game where you and your opponents compete in a rumble to determine a champion.
[4907.05s -> 4911.61s]  Harness new summoning powers to call upon grottoes, beasts, wishes.
[4911.61s -> 4914.91s]  You may even tag a powerful challenger to add even more crazy effects.
[4914.91s -> 4922.61s]  So, again, like I just said, the lore of this whole thing is back, it was March 6, 2021.
[4922.61s -> 4928.20s]  That stream kind of sparked this idea.
[4928.20s -> 4930.63s]  So, like, what if we, the original idea was we were going to,
[4930.63s -> 4938.30s]  oh, what if we just, like, release the 40, original 40 beasts and just put them in card packs and whatever.
[4938.30s -> 4940.38s]  Who cares?
[4940.38s -> 4943.55s]  It kind of evolved into where it is now.
[4943.55s -> 4945.92s]  And it's evolved many times.
[4945.92s -> 4951.51s]  Again, it's March 6 in a week.
[4951.51s -> 4957.50s]  So, kind of good timing here because that's the two-year anniversary of that stream.
[4957.50s -> 4962.01s]  We went into the desert, did all the digging, did all the stuff with the excavator.
[4962.01s -> 4963.01s]  It was really fun.
[4963.01s -> 4967.17s]  So, that is kind of what this project is.
[4967.17s -> 4968.34s]  That's where it started.
[4968.34s -> 4975.24s]  But going forward here, it's a real game.
[4975.24s -> 4977.48s]  It's a real card game.
[4977.48s -> 4982.86s]  A designer was hired to put this all together.
[4982.86s -> 4985.82s]  It plays.
[4985.82s -> 4989.39s]  It's a 1v1.
[4989.39s -> 4990.39s]  The game is a 1v1.
[4990.39s -> 4993.39s]  I think there's another game mode as well.
[4993.39s -> 4998.70s]  But this is not just, oh, it's, like, collectible cards.
[4998.70s -> 5002.02s]  It's also this big game.
[5002.02s -> 5005.70s]  Now people are probably asking, oh, that's kind of cool, man.
[5005.70s -> 5010.20s]  But, like, playing a game or collecting cards to make, like, a big deck.
[5010.20s -> 5015.13s]  The whole purpose of this project is for it to be community merch.
[5015.13s -> 5017.69s]  I'll address it a little bit later.
[5017.69s -> 5024.82s]  But the number one thing that I care about here is people being able just to do this for fun.
[5024.82s -> 5029.02s]  But there's an unbelievably cool game that's behind the whole thing.
[5029.02s -> 5032.69s]  So, they are standard playing card sizes.
[5032.69s -> 5035.86s]  We've seen that question a million times.
[5035.86s -> 5038.86s]  Hey, can they fit into the sleeves?
[5038.86s -> 5039.86s]  Yes.
[5039.86s -> 5041.86s]  Standard playing card size.
[5041.86s -> 5042.86s]  Three and a half by two and a half.
[5042.86s -> 5044.42s]  There are rarities.
[5044.42s -> 5047.29s]  Common and rare.
[5047.29s -> 5049.66s]  As you can see, they have a C or an R above the card number.
[5049.66s -> 5052.66s]  There are holographic versions of every card.
[5052.66s -> 5054.90s]  Every single card has a holographic version.
[5054.90s -> 5059.91s]  And there are, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong,
[5059.91s -> 5063.91s]  Grotto Beasts group chat because they're probably going to scream at me if I say this wrong.
[5063.91s -> 5067.79s]  There are four different holographic types.
[5067.79s -> 5073.06s]  Is that correct, right?
[5073.06s -> 5076.99s]  Yes.
[5076.99s -> 5077.99s]  Okay, good. Four, yes.
[5077.99s -> 5081.62s]  So there are 200 different cards.
[5081.62s -> 5084.11s]  200 individual pieces of artwork.
[5084.11s -> 5090.10s]  I think the Grotto Beasts team has shown 150.
[5090.10s -> 5094.14s]  So also the original 40 are there as well.
[5094.14s -> 5100.15s]  There were 20 artists that came together to do this.
[5100.15s -> 5109.42s]  All the original 40 that featured in the stream plus 16 additional guest illustrators from the community were recruited.
[5109.42s -> 5110.42s]  One being me.
[5110.42s -> 5113.84s]  We revealed the card that I did last week, two weeks ago.
[5113.84s -> 5114.84s]  One guy.
[5114.84s -> 5118.53s]  And I think it's a phenomenal piece of artwork.
[5118.53s -> 5124.27s]  But hold on, I got a burp again.
[5124.27s -> 5126.86s]  Yeah.
[5126.86s -> 5130.34s]  There are four different card types.
[5130.34s -> 5131.34s]  There are wish cards.
[5131.34s -> 5133.34s]  Actually, this might be on the next page.
[5133.34s -> 5136.34s]  And by the way, this is all going to be available.
[5136.34s -> 5142.83s]  This FAQ here, it will be available as of probably tomorrow morning.
[5142.83s -> 5144.83s]  But I wanted to show it on stream first.
[5144.83s -> 5148.83s]  So this resource will be very easy for you to go look if you're like, wait, what the hell is he?
[5148.83s -> 5149.83s]  What did he say about this?
[5149.83s -> 5154.14s]  Four different cards, card types.
[5154.14s -> 5156.83s]  And a lot went into it, as you can see.
[5156.83s -> 5157.83s]  Here's the, all right, here we go, here we go.
[5157.83s -> 5158.83s]  Let's go.
[5158.83s -> 5160.46s]  Game info.
[5160.46s -> 5161.46s]  The rules.
[5161.46s -> 5164.02s]  Again, it's a 1v1 game.
[5164.02s -> 5165.02s]  Two players.
[5165.02s -> 5166.02s]  Classic dual gameplay.
[5166.02s -> 5168.19s]  Shorter and more competitive.
[5168.19s -> 5169.19s]  The Rumble.
[5169.19s -> 5170.19s]  Two players.
[5170.19s -> 5173.19s]  Adds challenger cards that change the way the decks interact with each other.
[5173.19s -> 5175.74s]  Or the Derma Rumble.
[5175.74s -> 5176.74s]  Three plus players.
[5176.74s -> 5177.74s]  Chaotic.
[5177.74s -> 5178.74s]  Intense.
[5178.74s -> 5180.30s]  Game mode.
[5180.30s -> 5181.30s]  There are three different ways to play it.
[5181.30s -> 5185.99s]  A deck, you make a deck, by the way.
[5185.99s -> 5189.62s]  So all decks must contain 40 cards.
[5189.62s -> 5192.62s]  Each deck can contain, hold on, I can't even read this right.
[5192.62s -> 5195.86s]  Each deck can contain up to three copies of each card that shares.
[5195.86s -> 5196.86s]  All right, let me ask.
[5196.86s -> 5203.23s]  When I used to do these in school, I would be like shuffling papers.
[5203.23s -> 5208.23s]  So when Abraham Lincoln, what year was he fucking born?
[5212.18s -> 5214.18s]  I feel like I'm shuffling papers around.
[5214.18s -> 5218.50s]  But yeah, so each deck has to have 40 cards to play.
[5218.50s -> 5223.86s]  Each deck can contain up to three copies of each card that shares the same card name.
[5223.86s -> 5225.86s]  So you can only have three in each deck.
[5225.86s -> 5227.86s]  You can't have like 10 of the same card.
[5227.86s -> 5232.30s]  They may only be one epic card type in your deck.
[5232.30s -> 5236.54s]  But just like other cards, you may have up to three of those.
[5236.54s -> 5242.61s]  So there is going to be, oh, epic.
[5242.61s -> 5249.71s]  There's going to be some media that is produced over the coming weeks to really show how this game is played.
[5249.71s -> 5263.46s]  Our game designer is starting to put together sort of an explanation because it's the game is it's about it's kind of like I'm trying to compare it to something.
[5263.46s -> 5264.46s]  What's the best thing to compare this to?
[5264.46s -> 5265.46s]  Grotto Beast group chat.
[5265.46s -> 5270.24s]  There will be full rules, explanations.
[5270.24s -> 5275.10s]  This is just to tell you what it is.
[5275.10s -> 5280.65s]  What's the best way to describe it?
[5280.65s -> 5285.96s]  No, it's kind.
[5285.96s -> 5286.96s]  I can't read that.
[5286.96s -> 5288.96s]  Somebody said somebody said something weird.
[5288.96s -> 5292.33s]  It's kind of like Yu-Gi-Oh, a little like Magic the Gathering.
[5292.33s -> 5295.95s]  It's it's kind of just like our design.
[5295.95s -> 5301.19s]  But the designer spent two years of his life on this and incredibly passionate.
[5301.19s -> 5303.19s]  He created a really fun, really interesting.
[5303.19s -> 5306.50s]  It's kind of hard to describe, but we will have all that info.
[5306.50s -> 5308.67s]  You'll see exactly how the game is played.
[5308.67s -> 5313.54s]  Or if you don't really care about playing the game, then you don't have to.
[5313.54s -> 5315.54s]  You can just get this if you feel like it.
[5315.54s -> 5318.76s]  Right. So here we go.
[5318.76s -> 5320.76s]  Take a look at this.
[5320.76s -> 5322.19s]  Here it is.
[5322.19s -> 5324.88s]  This is it right here.
[5324.88s -> 5325.88s]  This is the box.
[5325.88s -> 5327.38s]  These are the packs.
[5327.38s -> 5332.07s]  Let's go over what you get if you actually buy this.
[5332.07s -> 5336.21s]  So there are foil booster packs.
[5336.21s -> 5339.90s]  They each contain 10 cards total.
[5339.90s -> 5345.07s]  Two of those cards are guaranteed to be one rare and one holographic.
[5345.07s -> 5348.57s]  Every single card pack has a holographic.
[5348.57s -> 5351.57s]  One holographic in every single pack.
[5351.57s -> 5356.33s]  We wanted to make sure that it was going to be kind of fun to open.
[5356.33s -> 5359.78s]  There's also the starter kit.
[5359.78s -> 5366.54s]  So the two player starter kit is everything you need to be able to play or just collect it if you want.
[5366.54s -> 5369.72s]  It's got a lot of stuff in it.
[5369.72s -> 5374.72s]  It's got a huge rule book and I saw some, you know, 43 page rule book.
[5374.72s -> 5376.60s]  It's elaborate.
[5376.60s -> 5379.99s]  The game is very, very well made.
[5379.99s -> 5388.50s]  You get two play mats, which are here with artwork and, you know, places with some good rules and stuff and some phases.
[5388.50s -> 5391.18s]  Two preset decks.
[5391.18s -> 5392.18s]  You get two full decks.
[5392.18s -> 5394.74s]  And I will say I have a card.
[5394.74s -> 5400.80s]  There is a germa card and it's in one of these decks.
[5400.80s -> 5404.17s]  So if you buy the starter kit, you'll get my card.
[5404.17s -> 5407.69s]  We want to make sure that was a thing.
[5407.69s -> 5412.50s]  So inside you also get not just the two full decks.
[5412.50s -> 5414.50s]  You get two boosters in there as well.
[5414.50s -> 5416.51s]  Two boosters?
[5416.51s -> 5418.51s]  What an egomaniac.
[5418.51s -> 5421.82s]  So each starter kit has two boosters in it.
[5421.82s -> 5423.63s]  And look at this.
[5423.63s -> 5425.06s]  Two dice.
[5425.06s -> 5427.50s]  These are custom dice.
[5427.50s -> 5429.91s]  They have the logo.
[5429.91s -> 5430.91s]  The channel logo is on it.
[5430.91s -> 5437.12s]  So there's a pretty, there's a pretty decent amount of stuff in this box.
[5437.12s -> 5440.12s]  In total, the two player starter kit has 104 cards.
[5440.12s -> 5445.05s]  Now let's go over kind of sort of what does that mean?
[5445.05s -> 5448.05s]  There are 200 cards total, like individual different cards.
[5448.05s -> 5450.61s]  The boosters have 10 in them.
[5450.61s -> 5452.98s]  And you get two preset decks.
[5452.98s -> 5457.15s]  Each deck I believe has 42 cards in it in this particular set.
[5457.15s -> 5460.38s]  That's correct, right?
[5460.38s -> 5467.54s]  Grottobeast group chat, please help me.
[5467.54s -> 5470.68s]  Grottobeast group chat, please help me.
[5470.68s -> 5476.61s]  There are 42 cards in each deck in the pre-built decks, right?
[5476.61s -> 5480.02s]  Yes, okay.
[5480.02s -> 5482.02s]  I just want to make sure I don't say anything that's incorrect.
[5482.02s -> 5486.06s]  So that's what you get in the box.
[5486.06s -> 5492.22s]  And I'm looking at it right now and I still can't fucking believe how just crazy this is.
[5493.46s -> 5500.13s]  Dude, you're in class shouting at the other people on the group project.
[5500.13s -> 5501.13s]  Can you imagine?
[5501.13s -> 5506.03s]  Throw, I got to throw everybody that worked on the project under the bus.
[5506.03s -> 5510.73s]  So let's keep going.
[5510.73s -> 5514.48s]  So yeah, you get the dice, you get the two, you get two of these by the way.
[5514.48s -> 5517.72s]  You get two play mats, two full decks, the rule book.
[5517.72s -> 5520.34s]  And each one of these has like really cool artwork on it.
[5520.34s -> 5523.34s]  A lot of time, a lot of dedication, a lot of detail went into this.
[5523.34s -> 5526.65s]  So the rule book itself, there's a lot of really just nice stuff in it.
[5526.65s -> 5527.65s]  It's really cool.
[5527.65s -> 5531.19s]  So we can keep going.
[5531.19s -> 5533.01s]  All right.
[5533.01s -> 5535.01s]  When will the presale be?
[5535.01s -> 5537.01s]  What's happening right now?
[5537.01s -> 5538.01s]  What's happening?
[5538.01s -> 5539.01s]  Ooh, did you see that?
[5539.01s -> 5542.95s]  So presales will be up on our website today until the full release
[5542.95s -> 5545.95s]  to ensure those who have followed closely a chance to get their cards.
[5545.95s -> 5551.58s]  We are going to take presale orders because we want to make sure,
[5551.58s -> 5554.89s]  I told you guys this, I want to say like a month or two ago,
[5554.89s -> 5559.15s]  there's a lot of people that said that they really want to be able to get this.
[5559.15s -> 5562.52s]  And I don't, we didn't want to have it be a scenario where,
[5562.52s -> 5566.02s]  oh yeah, there's only like 500 of them.
[5566.02s -> 5567.02s]  Good luck.
[5567.02s -> 5569.02s]  And then people just can't get it.
[5569.02s -> 5574.41s]  So the idea is we want to keep a presale going for essentially,
[5574.41s -> 5578.90s]  we want anybody that wants to be able to get it to be able to presale, to buy it.
[5578.90s -> 5584.87s]  If you are interested, that's why we're going to keep a presale going for a little while.
[5584.87s -> 5589.33s]  So what about international shipping and scalper prevention?
[5589.33s -> 5590.33s]  Here's the big take.
[5590.33s -> 5593.40s]  I guess that kind of leads into this.
[5593.40s -> 5598.90s]  So yes, there will be international shipping and the fulfillment team that we're using,
[5598.90s -> 5604.31s]  they're going to have some measures in place to prevent some of the more egregious forms
[5604.31s -> 5606.31s]  of people buying and scalping, right?
[5606.31s -> 5608.81s]  But also presales are going to help with that too,
[5608.81s -> 5614.86s]  because these are just being sold and we have a quantity
[5614.86s -> 5616.86s]  and we're just going to continue to keep a presale open.
[5616.86s -> 5619.70s]  There you go.
[5619.70s -> 5621.33s]  All right, what about these questions?
[5621.33s -> 5624.33s]  Further print runs, more merch types, tournaments.
[5624.33s -> 5626.89s]  All right, so the game is currently in a limited print run.
[5626.89s -> 5629.89s]  There's plenty of stock to help ensure anyone who wants the cards will be able to get them.
[5629.89s -> 5634.32s]  So further print runs depend on if or how we run out of stock.
[5634.32s -> 5637.14s]  And again, the potential for ideas is exciting,
[5637.14s -> 5641.06s]  but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves or over promise.
[5641.06s -> 5644.06s]  I don't want to tell you guys, oh, wow, there's all this other shit that's planned.
[5644.06s -> 5646.30s]  No, let's just get, let's get through this first.
[5646.30s -> 5653.71s]  Let's do this part first before, you know, going forward.
[5653.71s -> 5662.66s]  There's some interesting things in this part too.
[5662.66s -> 5664.66s]  Can I do artwork for Grotto Beasts?
[5664.66s -> 5666.96s]  The project is done.
[5666.96s -> 5669.14s]  So we do appreciate anybody that's reached out.
[5669.14s -> 5670.14s]  People have reached out.
[5670.14s -> 5677.28s]  And we are so happy and excited that people really want to,
[5677.28s -> 5680.28s]  hey, dude, I got this, I got this, I could do this, I could do this.
[5680.28s -> 5682.58s]  We need to get through this sale first.
[5682.58s -> 5685.95s]  We really appreciate it, but the project is complete.
[5685.95s -> 5691.59s]  So just let us get through this period first.
[5691.59s -> 5694.59s]  And there are 20, there are 20 artists.
[5694.59s -> 5698.50s]  So that's like part of that too.
[5698.50s -> 5699.50s]  And why did you not crowdfund this?
[5699.50s -> 5700.50s]  What's wrong with you?
[5700.50s -> 5703.49s]  I don't, I don't want to do that.
[5703.49s -> 5707.92s]  I would rather be able to have, oh, hey, there was a Kickstarter project.
[5707.92s -> 5711.92s]  And yeah, I kickstarted it for $500.
[5711.92s -> 5712.92s]  Where's all my shit?
[5712.92s -> 5714.92s]  How come it's not done?
[5714.92s -> 5715.92s]  It's been two years.
[5715.92s -> 5716.92s]  What's going on here?
[5716.92s -> 5718.92s]  I don't want to take your money and not give you a product.
[5718.92s -> 5722.61s]  I don't want to take your money and over-promise something and not deliver.
[5722.61s -> 5728.54s]  So that's why I didn't do a Kickstarter.
[5728.54s -> 5734.53s]  What other Jermaverse characters in Jermaverse is, you know,
[5734.53s -> 5737.47s]  I guess we can use that term here.
[5737.47s -> 5738.47s]  So what characters are in the game?
[5738.47s -> 5748.78s]  This is like 12 years of references to the channel.
[5748.78s -> 5752.47s]  And this is the big merch that I will ever do.
[5752.47s -> 5758.25s]  This idea was actually something I wanted to do years and years and years ago.
[5758.25s -> 5759.94s]  But I just didn't have the capabilities.
[5759.94s -> 5760.94s]  I didn't have the support network.
[5760.94s -> 5761.94s]  I didn't have the people.
[5761.94s -> 5764.11s]  I didn't have the capital.
[5764.11s -> 5767.11s]  I didn't have the money to be able to do something like this.
[5767.11s -> 5773.11s]  So this, when people ask for merch, this is it.
[5773.11s -> 5774.11s]  This is merch.
[5774.11s -> 5781.98s]  And it's probably the most ridiculous merch I will ever do.
[5781.98s -> 5789.83s]  You're never going to see anything like this on this channel ever again.
[5789.83s -> 5796.54s]  So, but interestingly enough, there are some cards that reference nothing.
[5796.54s -> 5801.74s]  So I told you about the Mr. Green's casino stream that never happened.
[5801.74s -> 5803.74s]  We thought it was going to happen.
[5803.74s -> 5806.74s]  So there are like three or four cards in the game
[5806.74s -> 5811.18s]  that reference the Mr. Green's stream that didn't happen.
[5811.18s -> 5820.43s]  I was going to get into prosthetics and the Mr. Green's card
[5820.43s -> 5825.23s]  is actually modeled off of like my face.
[5825.23s -> 5827.73s]  So we were going to, I was going to get into a costume
[5827.73s -> 5829.73s]  and I was going to do all this stuff and we have all these references
[5829.73s -> 5830.73s]  and it never happened.
[5830.73s -> 5833.59s]  So secret.
[5833.59s -> 5836.58s]  Bring it back.
[5836.58s -> 5838.34s]  I don't think so.
[5838.34s -> 5839.34s]  That's not going to happen.
[5839.34s -> 5840.34s]  There are no plans to do that.
[5840.34s -> 5844.14s]  Why is it canceled?
[5844.14s -> 5849.69s]  Well, it just was, it just was too much.
[5849.69s -> 5850.69s]  It was too hard.
[5850.69s -> 5851.69s]  Too much going on.
[5851.69s -> 5855.14s]  But yeah, let's go over now.
[5855.14s -> 5856.14s]  Excuse me.
[5856.14s -> 5858.14s]  Let's talk about this really quickly.
[5858.14s -> 5860.38s]  No, it's not an NFT project.
[5860.38s -> 5861.94s]  This is not an NFT.
[5861.94s -> 5864.94s]  This is physical cards, standard card size.
[5864.94s -> 5869.74s]  And they come in a box or they come in an oil pack.
[5869.74s -> 5871.43s]  And that's it.
[5871.43s -> 5873.43s]  It's not an NFT.
[5873.43s -> 5876.59s]  What about a wiki?
[5876.59s -> 5881.73s]  We are planning on hosting and curing an official wiki for the project.
[5881.73s -> 5884.35s]  Lots of which will be intentionally left obscured.
[5884.35s -> 5886.72s]  So there's still lots to discover as the game releases.
[5886.72s -> 5891.09s]  We'll be populating with extra details like developers' notes and concepts
[5891.09s -> 5893.09s]  and more world building as we go along.
[5893.09s -> 5895.82s]  So there will be an official wiki.
[5895.82s -> 5899.82s]  There will be, this is going to be a project that over the coming couple of weeks
[5899.82s -> 5905.74s]  you'll see a lot more detail on how it's going to play out
[5905.74s -> 5908.74s]  and when shipping is going to happen.
[5908.74s -> 5911.74s]  Let us get through this pre-sale first.
[5911.74s -> 5916.22s]  Can you eat the Grotto Beast cards?
[5916.22s -> 5917.58s]  Are they flavored?
[5917.58s -> 5918.58s]  Please do not eat the cards.
[5918.58s -> 5921.76s]  They're not edible and they would probably taste very bad.
[5921.76s -> 5925.32s]  Concerningly, this is one of the most frequently asked questions.
[5925.32s -> 5927.78s]  Do not eat them.
[5927.78s -> 5929.78s]  I know a lot of people have a ton of questions.
[5929.78s -> 5933.78s]  A lot of people have so many questions and I would love to answer them all.
[5933.78s -> 5940.18s]  Let's start here and let's get to the most important part that everyone's asking.
[5940.18s -> 5943.25s]  How much does this shit cost?
[5943.25s -> 5949.39s]  Should we go over this first?
[5949.39s -> 5955.26s]  Hold on, wait, what happened? Did I skip that page?
[5955.26s -> 5960.98s]  Did I skip a page? Did I?
[5960.98s -> 5961.98s]  I didn't skip a page, right?
[5961.98s -> 5965.59s]  No, I didn't.
[5965.59s -> 5971.46s]  All right, let's talk about price because I know a lot of people are going to say,
[5971.46s -> 5973.02s]  how much is this shit?
[5973.02s -> 5980.35s]  So that starter kit, I told you guys a few weeks ago,
[5980.35s -> 5988.29s]  I so badly wanted to keep it under $100 and it's a limited run product.
[5988.29s -> 5992.09s]  We had to contact a manufacturing company.
[5992.09s -> 5994.65s]  We only have a limited supply.
[5994.65s -> 5999.27s]  So we tried to keep the price as low as we could
[5999.27s -> 6002.27s]  and still be able to, you know, sell a certain amount
[6002.27s -> 6005.27s]  and be able to at least try to make back the project money
[6005.27s -> 6007.27s]  and try to make a little bit of money doing it, right?
[6007.27s -> 6008.77s]  I'll be honest.
[6008.77s -> 6013.25s]  So it's not $100, which is expensive and I know it's expensive.
[6013.25s -> 6017.55s]  And I know that a lot of people are going to see what this actually costs
[6017.55s -> 6021.54s]  and they're going to say, how much is it?
[6021.54s -> 6024.54s]  Is it $90? It's not $90, it's $79.99.
[6024.54s -> 6027.30s]  It's $80 for the starter kit.
[6027.30s -> 6029.73s]  And in the starter kit, you get the two booster packs.
[6029.73s -> 6032.73s]  The booster packs are going for $9.99, $10.
[6032.73s -> 6037.30s]  And the issue that I've had, that I've always had,
[6037.30s -> 6039.79s]  was trying to make it so...
[6039.79s -> 6045.38s]  I just didn't want it to be so unbelievably egregious,
[6045.38s -> 6053.63s]  but I don't know, it's a really tough thing to do.
[6053.63s -> 6056.63s]  But I did promise you guys that I was going to keep that starter kit under $100
[6056.63s -> 6059.82s]  and it turns out it's $79.99.
[6059.82s -> 6066.19s]  But if you want to go back and kind of see exactly what you get in that box,
[6066.19s -> 6069.01s]  we wanted to make value.
[6069.01s -> 6071.95s]  We wanted there to be value in it.
[6071.95s -> 6073.95s]  Oh no, let's put two custom dice in it.
[6073.95s -> 6075.95s]  That sounds fun. Throw that in there.
[6075.95s -> 6079.38s]  How's the box? Does the box have a good quality?
[6079.38s -> 6083.14s]  Yeah, let's try to make the box a little bit nicer.
[6083.14s -> 6097.55s]  So there's been a lot of soul-searching on how to actually make this have some value to it.
[6097.55s -> 6103.90s]  So as we go forward...
[6103.90s -> 6104.90s]  What did you say?
[6104.90s -> 6107.52s]  I know people are going to have a ton of questions.
[6107.52s -> 6110.21s]  But how long the presale is going for?
[6110.21s -> 6112.90s]  That's a really good question.
[6112.90s -> 6121.27s]  The presale is going for at least the foreseeable future.
[6121.27s -> 6126.41s]  We need to see how many people actually are buying it or how many people actually want it.
[6126.41s -> 6129.41s]  And if you don't want it, if it's something that you're not really that interested in,
[6129.41s -> 6131.41s]  if it's like, oh no, sorry, dude, no, no, no, thanks,
[6131.41s -> 6137.62s]  then let's fucking hang out and play Frog Detective, right?
[6137.62s -> 6143.89s]  But just know that this is a project that is kind of like 12 years in the making.
[6143.89s -> 6148.54s]  I wanted to make sure it was high quality. I wanted to make sure it was fun.
[6148.54s -> 6153.22s]  And hopefully you guys enjoy it because the team put a lot of time into it.
[6153.22s -> 6156.68s]  And if you want to see who those people are...
[6156.68s -> 6159.68s]  This is just a little letter that the team wanted to put together.
[6159.68s -> 6168.18s]  Here's the people that worked on it.
[6168.18s -> 6170.18s]  Not a huge team.
[6170.18s -> 6172.18s]  It's a very small team.
[6172.18s -> 6181.44s]  But I feel like it's...
[6181.44s -> 6183.44s]  I'm so glad to be able to even talk about this.
[6183.44s -> 6186.44s]  Because people have said, dude, when are you going to be able to talk about this?
[6186.44s -> 6188.94s]  When the hell is this happening?
[6188.94s -> 6189.94s]  You can't give us any info?
[6189.94s -> 6191.94s]  I didn't want to give you guys wrong info.
[6191.94s -> 6197.46s]  I didn't want to give you info that was incorrect.
[6197.46s -> 6204.44s]  But let me just go back real quickly.
[6204.44s -> 6207.44s]  Because I want to be able to see what is in the box.
[6207.44s -> 6210.98s]  Let's go back.
[6210.98s -> 6213.76s]  Here we go. Okay.
[6213.76s -> 6221.70s]  So this is what is inside of that kit.
[6221.70s -> 6229.31s]  When is the pre-sales going to end?
[6229.31s -> 6237.06s]  Again, that's a question that we need to see just how this goes.
[6237.06s -> 6241.06s]  Because I want to make sure that anybody that wants it has an opportunity to get it.
[6241.06s -> 6247.06s]  I don't want to end pre-sales before enough people have shown interest in getting it.
[6247.06s -> 6249.06s]  Because I don't want to end it too early.
[6249.06s -> 6256.54s]  I also don't want to end it too late either.
[6256.54s -> 6258.54s]  43 pages. Yeah, it's a read.
[6258.54s -> 6261.68s]  We've got some time on a Sunday afternoon.
[6261.68s -> 6263.68s]  Have I played it? I have played it.
[6263.68s -> 6265.43s]  It was very fun.
[6265.43s -> 6273.02s]  It's going to be at least a week or two in pre-sale.
[6273.02s -> 6275.02s]  Just got the starter pack from my fiance.
[6275.02s -> 6276.02s]  So excited.
[6276.02s -> 6277.02s]  I hope you like it.
[6277.02s -> 6278.02s]  I really do.
[6278.02s -> 6281.52s]  Anytime talking about merch, you guys know me.
[6281.52s -> 6283.52s]  I'm not a fucking merch person.
[6283.52s -> 6285.27s]  I'm not.
[6285.27s -> 6288.34s]  So this whole process has been really...
[6288.34s -> 6289.34s]  I hope you like it.
[6289.34s -> 6291.78s]  A lot of work went into it.
[6291.78s -> 6294.30s]  I hope you enjoy it.
[6294.30s -> 6296.54s]  You can afford it if you can't.
[6296.54s -> 6298.54s]  There's other stuff that's going to be on the site.
[6298.54s -> 6300.84s]  We have posters.
[6300.84s -> 6301.84s]  We have...
[6301.84s -> 6303.84s]  I think you can get a four pack of cards.
[6303.84s -> 6305.84s]  You can get individual card packs.
[6305.84s -> 6307.08s]  There's merchandise.
[6307.08s -> 6308.08s]  There's clothing.
[6308.08s -> 6313.40s]  So I just wanted a bunch of options for people.
[6313.40s -> 6314.40s]  I can show the website too.
[6314.40s -> 6315.40s]  Let's actually go to it.
[6315.40s -> 6316.40s]  Hold on.
[6316.40s -> 6320.84s]  Let me show it.
[6320.84s -> 6336.16s]  And that is grottobeasts.net.
[6336.16s -> 6339.70s]  Let's show it.
[6339.70s -> 6340.70s]  Can you see?
[6340.70s -> 6343.10s]  You cannot see.
[6343.10s -> 6350.71s]  You will in a second.
[6350.71s -> 6354.69s]  Okay.
[6354.69s -> 6356.69s]  Let's open this back up.
[6356.69s -> 6361.32s]  Why is it not capturing?
[6361.32s -> 6362.32s]  Capture.
[6362.32s -> 6363.32s]  I have to show them the site.
[6363.32s -> 6369.38s]  I have to show it to them before I get in trouble.
[6369.38s -> 6371.58s]  Is that working?
[6371.58s -> 6372.58s]  Hold on.
[6372.58s -> 6373.58s]  Technical difficulties.
[6373.58s -> 6377.57s]  Hold on.
[6377.57s -> 6378.57s]  Okay.
[6378.57s -> 6389.54s]  Now you should be able to see it.
[6389.54s -> 6390.90s]  All right.
[6390.90s -> 6391.90s]  Here we go.
[6391.90s -> 6400.76s]  Let's show the site.
[6400.76s -> 6402.58s]  Hey.
[6402.58s -> 6403.58s]  Okay.
[6403.58s -> 6407.82s]  So this is grottobeasts.net.
[6407.82s -> 6409.82s]  Kind of a cool little intro graphic here.
[6409.82s -> 6412.47s]  Scroll down.
[6412.47s -> 6413.47s]  Here you go.
[6413.47s -> 6416.35s]  Here is the...
[6416.35s -> 6417.35s]  Here's the starter kit.
[6417.35s -> 6420.09s]  Here are the packs.
[6420.09s -> 6425.58s]  Also, keep in mind, so the four packs, we wanted to do a bundle of four packs because
[6425.58s -> 6426.89s]  this will save you on shipping.
[6426.89s -> 6430.89s]  If you do want to get this and you do want to get more than one of these, this will save
[6430.89s -> 6431.89s]  you on shipping.
[6431.89s -> 6436.48s]  Do you have ad block on?
[6436.48s -> 6442.94s]  Don't pay attention to that.
[6442.94s -> 6444.12s]  Using Chrome?
[6444.12s -> 6445.12s]  What?
[6445.12s -> 6447.49s]  It's not Chrome?
[6447.49s -> 6450.33s]  Yeah.
[6450.33s -> 6452.33s]  So here's the product.
[6452.33s -> 6454.02s]  Here it is.
[6454.02s -> 6456.28s]  What's wrong with Firefox?
[6456.28s -> 6457.28s]  You got a Firefox problem?
[6457.28s -> 6458.28s]  I don't get it.
[6458.28s -> 6459.90s]  So here you go.
[6459.90s -> 6462.17s]  This is the website.
[6462.17s -> 6463.17s]  This is where you go.
[6463.17s -> 6467.61s]  If you want to get it, grottobeasts.net, there's also these.
[6467.61s -> 6469.61s]  These are cards in the game.
[6469.61s -> 6473.04s]  Demonloids, Araxos, Bugleberry, Glooman.
[6473.04s -> 6478.74s]  And again, we wanted to make sure that if people wanted to participate and they don't
[6478.74s -> 6479.74s]  want...
[6479.74s -> 6483.74s]  Jerma, I don't have a fucking hundred plus dollars to spend on this shit.
[6483.74s -> 6487.28s]  Well, then if you want to participate and you really still do, I just...
[6487.28s -> 6488.28s]  We wanted to make sure there was stuff available.
[6488.28s -> 6489.28s]  We really did.
[6489.28s -> 6490.46s]  Here are the merch.
[6490.46s -> 6491.46s]  Here are the shirts.
[6491.46s -> 6496.70s]  Coming in an assortment of colors.
[6496.70s -> 6497.70s]  There's hoodies.
[6497.70s -> 6499.97s]  Here down here.
[6499.97s -> 6503.97s]  This is the original 40 Beasts for the original stream, which is pretty cool.
[6503.97s -> 6508.23s]  You're talking like my mom right now.
[6508.23s -> 6512.93s]  But here's a really cool thing.
[6512.93s -> 6515.49s]  So this, this one glows in the dark.
[6515.49s -> 6520.88s]  You can get the glow in the dark version or the one that's not glow in the dark, which
[6520.88s -> 6521.88s]  would be this one here.
[6521.88s -> 6525.02s]  Yeah, but you can get the glow in the dark hoodie as well.
[6525.02s -> 6532.02s]  Are you blazed right now?
[6532.02s -> 6534.02s]  And then like hats too and other stuff.
[6534.02s -> 6535.45s]  And it's a lot.
[6535.45s -> 6538.62s]  This project is monumental.
[6538.62s -> 6545.18s]  And it's, it's a, it's, I don't know.
[6545.18s -> 6546.18s]  Thanks, guys.
[6546.18s -> 6548.25s]  This is not possible.
[6548.25s -> 6552.92s]  I can't do this project without having the community people that have been supporting
[6552.92s -> 6557.06s]  this channel for the last 10 to 12 years.
[6557.06s -> 6560.81s]  There's a lot of community references.
[6560.81s -> 6566.67s]  There's a hundred, a hundred cards, I think, or 120 cards are here.
[6566.67s -> 6569.10s]  There's the original new Grotto Beast.
[6569.10s -> 6573.28s]  There's new, there's new characters in here.
[6573.28s -> 6575.48s]  And it's really, really cool.
[6575.48s -> 6580.51s]  And also I wanted to make sure that I clarify this to the starter kit.
[6580.51s -> 6583.51s]  The starter kit does have, there are over a hundred and four.
[6583.51s -> 6584.51s]  They're not over.
[6584.51s -> 6586.51s]  There's a hundred and four cards in the starter kit.
[6586.51s -> 6588.51s]  That's including the two boosters you get in this.
[6588.51s -> 6595.57s]  But the two pre-made decks, there are 80, what, 84 cards.
[6595.57s -> 6598.06s]  They are, there are some doubles.
[6598.06s -> 6602.56s]  There are some doubles in here because the way that the decks are made, because remember
[6602.56s -> 6607.56s]  you can have up to three in each deck and these both decks are pre-made to kind of do
[6607.56s -> 6609.56s]  a specific play style.
[6609.56s -> 6611.18s]  Yeah, it comes with two packs.
[6611.18s -> 6613.90s]  There it is.
[6613.90s -> 6615.90s]  There's your Grotto Beasts.
[6615.90s -> 6620.63s]  Will it be new cards added over time?
[6620.63s -> 6623.32s]  I cannot answer that question.
[6623.32s -> 6625.32s]  I cannot answer it.
[6625.32s -> 6628.84s]  Let's get through this first.
[6628.84s -> 6633.14s]  We need to see how many people actually really want this because we don't know.
[6633.14s -> 6636.38s]  This is a, this is really uncharted territory.
[6636.38s -> 6643.70s]  And the two boosters, by the way, are two regular, they're random packs.
[6643.70s -> 6647.94s]  So these, the two decks in here are the same.
[6647.94s -> 6648.94s]  They are pre-built.
[6648.94s -> 6650.94s]  They're the same in every single one of these.
[6650.94s -> 6654.94s]  The two boosters you get in here are as if you had these.
[6654.94s -> 6656.30s]  They're random.
[6656.30s -> 6668.21s]  Again, each one of those has a rare and a holographic in these foil packs.
[6668.21s -> 6669.21s]  How many cards are in the whole game?
[6669.21s -> 6670.21s]  200.
[6670.21s -> 6672.64s]  There are 200 different cards.
[6672.64s -> 6680.68s]  Are there any Polaroids of you flipping off the camera?
[6680.68s -> 6683.75s]  No, there aren't.
[6683.75s -> 6687.99s]  There's already going to be like holographic versions of some of these cards.
[6687.99s -> 6692.30s]  And I don't know, I feel like that's going to be really fun to watch people just,
[6692.30s -> 6695.73s]  hey, look, I got a holographic Meowty or whatever, right?
[6695.73s -> 6697.73s]  Oh, I got a holographic Glueman.
[6697.73s -> 6699.73s]  That's really interesting.
[6699.73s -> 6706.10s]  And I don't want to make me giving the double middle finger like 10 of them randomly to,
[6706.10s -> 6711.53s]  I don't know, I don't want that to be some crazy valuable item that then is,
[6711.53s -> 6723.19s]  no, no, I'd rather not like increase the value because it was only going to go in like 10 of them.
[6723.19s -> 6725.88s]  Do we have a list of the rarities?
[6725.88s -> 6727.88s]  I believe we do.
[6728.88s -> 6735.86s]  Yes, we do.
[6735.86s -> 6738.86s]  We do have a list of every single rarity and everything.
[6738.86s -> 6739.86s]  So we do.
[6739.86s -> 6744.04s]  Will there be a food mode?
[6744.04s -> 6747.18s]  Are there any glow in the dark cards?
[6747.18s -> 6749.18s]  That's an incredibly cool idea.
[6749.18s -> 6750.18s]  But the answer is no.
[6750.18s -> 6755.08s]  Yeah, we're going to make that of that will be public information.
[6755.08s -> 6760.90s]  So the different rarities and the different all that stuff that will be on the official wiki.
[6760.90s -> 6763.07s]  So that will be public information.
[6763.07s -> 6768.00s]  Yeah, they're clearly marked with a C and an R too.
[6768.00s -> 6771.00s]  So if it's a rare or common, that's in the you'll see it in the card.
[6771.00s -> 6776.95s]  Is there a Mr. Green's card?
[6776.95s -> 6777.95s]  Yes, there is.
[6777.95s -> 6788.34s]  Is buying four single packs cheaper than buying the four pack?
[6788.34s -> 6792.90s]  The idea with the four pack was to make it so you didn't.
[6792.90s -> 6794.90s]  So this will save on shipping.
[6794.90s -> 6797.84s]  That was the idea.
[6797.84s -> 6800.21s]  It also depends on where you are too.
[6800.21s -> 6803.21s]  Shipping is different for a lot of different areas.
[6803.21s -> 6811.44s]  But because if you buy an individual pack, you have to pay shipping for that pack.
[6811.44s -> 6818.00s]  So we thought that, OK, if you were going to get more than two, three or four of these,
[6818.00s -> 6822.30s]  and we want to make sure that you're not getting the shipping will be much lower.
[6822.30s -> 6826.57s]  If you were just to get these, if you planned on doing that.
[6826.57s -> 6834.90s]  Yeah, it's it's a it's not about the price of the list here.
[6834.90s -> 6835.90s]  It's about shipping.
[6835.90s -> 6846.86s]  How come it ends in ninety five and not nine five like nine eight five?
[6846.86s -> 6850.42s]  We thought about making the booster packs nine eighty five.
[6850.42s -> 6854.50s]  But it's just like, yeah, yeah.
[6854.50s -> 6858.82s]  Did the pre-made deck have hollows?
[6858.82s -> 6861.32s]  The answer, I believe that that question is no.
[6861.32s -> 6866.82s]  I believe the answer to that question is no.
[6866.82s -> 6870.51s]  But you do get two of these in here.
[6870.51s -> 6875.84s]  So with the starter kit, you will get two hollows.
[6875.84s -> 6879.84s]  So I mean, technically you will get two holographic cards if you get here, if you get this box.
[6879.84s -> 6884.83s]  So I guess yes, technically speaking.
[6884.83s -> 6890.21s]  Where will the rules be posted?
[6890.21s -> 6894.62s]  The rules will be very publicly posted in.
[6894.62s -> 6897.62s]  We're going to talk to the game designer, the rulebook.
[6897.62s -> 6900.62s]  We're going to make sure that people can actually have a condensed version of the rulebook online.
[6900.62s -> 6906.06s]  Are you going to do a stream showing this?
[6906.06s -> 6912.06s]  At the very least, there's going to be a video that will show exactly how the game is played.
[6912.06s -> 6914.43s]  And we'll watch it.
[6914.43s -> 6915.43s]  We'll talk about it.
[6915.43s -> 6916.43s]  I'll link to it.
[6916.43s -> 6918.43s]  There'll be plenty of resources on the website.
[6918.43s -> 6919.43s]  I promise.
[6919.43s -> 6925.92s]  Let me see this question.
[6925.92s -> 6926.92s]  What is limited time?
[6926.92s -> 6929.61s]  Just the starter kit or everything?
[6929.61s -> 6931.78s]  So limited time.
[6931.78s -> 6933.78s]  It's not necessarily time.
[6933.78s -> 6936.52s]  It's inventory.
[6936.52s -> 6940.14s]  Because we, like I said, we're doing this pre-sale.
[6940.14s -> 6946.58s]  Because I don't want it to say, hey, guys, you've got fucking seven days to buy Grotto Beasts.
[6946.58s -> 6948.58s]  And I don't want to limit it by that.
[6948.58s -> 6949.75s]  I want to limit it.
[6949.75s -> 6952.75s]  It's like limited time is accurate.
[6952.75s -> 6954.75s]  But it's like limited inventory.
[6954.75s -> 6955.75s]  Right?
[6955.75s -> 6963.60s]  Because we, these have been, we printed.
[6963.60s -> 6964.60s]  Right?
[6964.60s -> 6966.03s]  Right?
[6966.03s -> 6967.03s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6967.03s -> 6968.03s]  Right?
[6968.03s -> 6969.03s]  I do that a lot, don't I?
[6969.03s -> 6977.47s]  So if you buy it right now, over the next couple of weeks, you're going to get it.
[6977.47s -> 6982.78s]  And again, the reason why we did this is to make sure that if you actually want to have this,
[6982.78s -> 6986.27s]  we don't just do a limited run that's six days.
[6986.27s -> 6992.28s]  Or we don't just say, hey, it's live and it's live till it's gone and there are 2,000 units.
[6992.28s -> 6994.46s]  And when they're gone, they're just gone.
[6994.46s -> 6996.46s]  And then it just kind of fucks over everybody.
[6996.46s -> 6999.85s]  Right?
[6999.85s -> 7010.41s]  Are the three posters the same as the cards?
[7010.41s -> 7011.41s]  Yes, this is.
[7011.41s -> 7013.41s]  These are the card art.
[7013.41s -> 7017.41s]  This is the exact artwork that is on these respective cards.
[7017.41s -> 7021.58s]  So you're getting essentially a poster print of the card art.
[7021.58s -> 7024.85s]  What size are the posters?
[7024.85s -> 7032.98s]  The posters are in GrottoBasis group chat, if I could get a little bit of an assistance here.
[7032.98s -> 7033.98s]  Is there an auto card?
[7033.98s -> 7036.63s]  Yes, there is.
[7036.63s -> 7040.00s]  It is 11 by 17 tabloid poster size.
[7040.00s -> 7046.59s]  Yes, there is an auto card.
[7046.59s -> 7050.11s]  Could there be a holographic auto card?
[7050.11s -> 7051.11s]  Yes.
[7051.11s -> 7052.29s]  And you bet your ass.
[7052.29s -> 7055.64s]  And you bet your ass.
[7055.64s -> 7057.64s]  You bet your ass I'm going to try to get that one.
[7057.64s -> 7064.10s]  What about the Discord?
[7064.10s -> 7067.65s]  Yeah, there's an opportunity to have a discussion channel.
[7067.65s -> 7071.89s]  Let me just be really clear about this too.
[7071.89s -> 7074.43s]  This is not the end.
[7074.43s -> 7076.44s]  This is not it.
[7076.44s -> 7081.82s]  There is another thing coming that you do not have to purchase.
[7081.82s -> 7087.39s]  That is, I can't fucking wait for you to see it.
[7087.39s -> 7090.53s]  It's not anything that you're going to have to buy.
[7090.53s -> 7093.83s]  It's just something really fucking cool.
[7093.83s -> 7096.14s]  You're not going to have to buy it.
[7096.14s -> 7099.68s]  There is more.
[7099.68s -> 7100.68s]  Yeah.
[7100.68s -> 7106.38s]  We have a thing.
[7106.38s -> 7109.81s]  How do I even talk about this without leaking anything?
[7109.81s -> 7119.32s]  There's a thing that you're going to see eventually in the next couple of weeks.
[7119.32s -> 7121.32s]  I don't know.
[7121.32s -> 7127.02s]  Is it audio visual?
[7127.02s -> 7135.19s]  No.
[7135.19s -> 7137.50s]  I'm done talking.
[7137.50s -> 7138.50s]  I'm getting yelled at.
[7138.50s -> 7139.50s]  I'm getting yelled at.
[7139.50s -> 7140.50s]  I'm getting yelled at.
[7140.50s -> 7141.50s]  I'm getting yelled at.
[7141.50s -> 7142.80s]  I'm going to get yelled at.
[7142.80s -> 7143.80s]  I'm going to get yelled at.
[7143.80s -> 7144.80s]  It's cool.
[7144.80s -> 7149.80s]  Whatever this thing that I'm talking about is, it's super interesting and you don't have
[7149.80s -> 7150.98s]  to buy it.
[7150.98s -> 7151.98s]  Yeah.
[7151.98s -> 7152.98s]  All right.
[7152.98s -> 7154.47s]  Yeah.
[7154.47s -> 7158.59s]  Cool.
[7158.59s -> 7159.59s]  But yeah, there it is.
[7159.59s -> 7165.14s]  The whole team has been waiting to do this for so long.
[7165.14s -> 7172.53s]  There were so many things to fix, so many production issues, so much going on during
[7172.53s -> 7175.53s]  this project that all of us are just super happy that it's actually here.
[7175.53s -> 7182.96s]  When you get it, I hope it makes you happy.
[7182.96s -> 7183.96s]  And that's pretty much it.
[7183.96s -> 7185.96s]  Am I missing anything GrottoBeast team?
[7185.96s -> 7196.75s]  Anything else to say initially here?
[7196.75s -> 7210.79s]  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
[7210.79s -> 7215.44s]  Can you buy this stuff like the dice individually?
[7215.44s -> 7218.19s]  We don't have a plan to do that.
[7218.19s -> 7225.18s]  I think the point was to try to increase the value of this because the original prototype
[7225.18s -> 7227.18s]  of this was, all right, how does this work?
[7227.18s -> 7230.92s]  We have, okay, we're going to have two decks in there.
[7230.92s -> 7231.92s]  It's going to be a box.
[7231.92s -> 7233.54s]  All right.
[7233.54s -> 7235.54s]  And how much are we going to charge for this thing?
[7235.54s -> 7236.78s]  All right.
[7236.78s -> 7237.78s]  Put in other stuff.
[7237.78s -> 7241.22s]  Make it a ton of artwork in there.
[7241.22s -> 7245.46s]  Have dice in there because some of the things require, you know, dice.
[7245.46s -> 7248.46s]  Just like little things to try to make it a little bit more worth it.
[7248.46s -> 7253.77s]  Who made the first sauce?
[7253.77s -> 7256.86s]  Exactly.
[7256.86s -> 7257.86s]  All right.
[7257.86s -> 7258.86s]  So here's a really important point.
[7258.86s -> 7265.88s]  Pre-sales won't run out, but getting one sooner might ensure that you get it sooner.
[7265.88s -> 7269.46s]  So pre-sales are not going to run out.
[7269.46s -> 7272.96s]  But if you order it sooner, you might get it sooner.
[7272.96s -> 7279.70s]  It just depends on how we can handle the production.
[7279.70s -> 7282.70s]  They are in production right now, by the way.
[7282.70s -> 7284.70s]  There are, we have an inventory that's in production right now.
[7284.70s -> 7292.00s]  And I will show you, I will show you these things in person.
[7292.00s -> 7294.65s]  So don't worry.
[7294.65s -> 7298.91s]  We want to make it like a nice setup where I can actually show you everything.
[7298.91s -> 7303.70s]  And let me tell you, I love it.
[7303.70s -> 7306.26s]  So if that means anything.
[7306.26s -> 7314.25s]  Is there a naked Jerma sitting at his PC card that could be holographic?
[7314.25s -> 7317.26s]  Unfortunately, the answer to that question is no.
[7317.26s -> 7320.26s]  Although, now that you say that, that's...
[7320.26s -> 7323.46s]  Well, here's another thing, too.
[7323.46s -> 7325.46s]  We wanted to make this kind of for all ages.
[7325.46s -> 7328.76s]  Or at least, you know, ages like 6 and up or whatever.
[7328.76s -> 7332.94s]  So there's not a lot of like, there's nothing really like fucked up in here.
[7332.94s -> 7338.31s]  I really wanted to be something that you could play with like your little brother.
[7338.31s -> 7340.77s]  Right?
[7340.77s -> 7342.77s]  So it's a general audience product.
[7342.77s -> 7350.45s]  You said you weren't naked though.
[7350.45s -> 7352.62s]  Man, I lie about a lot of stuff.
[7352.62s -> 7362.18s]  Alright, I think we can move on.
[7362.18s -> 7364.18s]  I'm going to take one quick VRB here.
[7364.18s -> 7365.18s]  Hopefully I covered a lot of stuff.
[7365.18s -> 7366.18s]  I know there was a lot.
[7366.18s -> 7368.18s]  And that, I don't want to overwhelm people too.
[7368.18s -> 7370.36s]  Because I'll be honest, I'm overwhelmed.
[7370.36s -> 7372.36s]  I'm very overwhelmed by this.
[7372.36s -> 7375.73s]  Because this is something we've been waiting to do for so long.
[7375.73s -> 7379.23s]  So I don't want to overwhelm everybody.
[7379.23s -> 7383.23s]  There's a lot of info, a lot of things that we'll be trickling out to you guys over the next few days.
[7383.23s -> 7385.50s]  It's available now.
[7385.50s -> 7388.38s]  Hopefully, hopefully you like it.
[7388.38s -> 7390.38s]  I know I've said that like a thousand times, but I really do.
[7390.38s -> 7397.80s]  Because, yeah, this community means a lot to me.
[7397.80s -> 7402.64s]  And when this project became a thing that was going to be real, it was like,
[7402.64s -> 7404.64s]  well, let's try to make it fucking awesome.
[7404.64s -> 7413.07s]  Because I'm never doing this ever again.
[7413.07s -> 7414.07s]  And it means a lot to me.
[7414.07s -> 7421.43s]  So, I look forward to what you, what you get in your packs.
[7421.43s -> 7423.43s]  Cry, cry, cry, cry.
[7423.43s -> 7433.84s]  It's a really cool thing for a streamer to do.
[7433.84s -> 7439.66s]  I think it is pretty damn cool.
[7439.66s -> 7448.29s]  I hope it translates well.
[7448.29s -> 7453.98s]  But let's go back to Frog Detective.
[7453.98s -> 7456.98s]  I think the whole Grottovice team right now just all went like,
[7456.98s -> 7459.22s]  okay, fuck, alright.
[7459.22s -> 7462.66s]  It's here, it's there, you can look at it.
[7462.66s -> 7470.38s]  Yeah, thanks to all of you.
[7470.38s -> 7474.25s]  Let's go play Frog Detective.
[7474.25s -> 7478.92s]  Your stocks are plummeting.
[7478.92s -> 7482.02s]  That's alright.
[7482.02s -> 7486.94s]  And yes, if you want to have me answer the question,
[7486.94s -> 7489.94s]  I will probably open some of this on stream.
[7489.94s -> 7490.94s]  Of course I will.
[7490.94s -> 7495.40s]  I will open a few packs and see what I get.
[7495.40s -> 7499.60s]  Really hope of that, you know, auto card.
[7499.60s -> 7507.83s]  You seem pretty stressed.
[7507.83s -> 7510.29s]  I'm not stressed.
[7510.29s -> 7514.73s]  I'm excited.
[7514.73s -> 7522.62s]  Alright.
[7522.62s -> 7524.06s]  One more BRB.
[7524.06s -> 7525.06s]  Grottovice.net.
[7525.06s -> 7528.42s]  Grottobeasts.net.
[7528.42s -> 7532.42s]  There's going to be a panel down in the panels under the channel.
[7532.42s -> 7540.83s]  That is like looking at it.
[7540.83s -> 7541.83s]  Let's go play Frog Detective.
[7541.83s -> 7542.83s]  I'll be right back.
[7542.83s -> 7543.83s]  Thanks, guys.
[7543.83s -> 7747.67s]  Okay, I have returned.
[7747.67s -> 7752.26s]  I just gave Holly a big hug and a big kiss.
[7752.26s -> 7761.77s]  She worked her fucking ass off on this project.
[7761.77s -> 7763.84s]  Everybody did.
[7763.84s -> 7765.46s]  Alright.
[7765.46s -> 7781.96s]  He just cried.
[7781.96s -> 7785.54s]  No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[7785.54s -> 7795.08s]  The core art team, a lot of it is the imagination of that.
[7795.08s -> 7797.08s]  Just the artists.
[7797.08s -> 7800.05s]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[7800.05s -> 7802.05s]  I'm super happy.
[7802.05s -> 7808.45s]  Alright, let's do funny voices.
[7808.45s -> 7814.68s]  Alright, is this?
[7814.68s -> 7815.68s]  Oh, there we go.
[7815.68s -> 7827.18s]  The sus guy is sobbing right now.
[7827.18s -> 7832.74s]  Wait, I need more flowers?
[7832.74s -> 7834.75s]  No, I don't.
[7834.75s -> 7844.95s]  We need Donald Trump now.
[7844.95s -> 7853.42s]  The Frog Detective voice actor was on hold for the last 30 minutes.
[7853.42s -> 7856.13s]  Alright, who's this person?
[7856.13s -> 7863.00s]  Should I put a filter on for this?
[7863.00s -> 7871.34s]  What kind of filter should be on?
[7871.34s -> 7881.14s]  Tell me what is too much.
[7881.14s -> 7883.32s]  That's low pitch.
[7883.32s -> 7886.54s]  This, right?
[7886.54s -> 7888.87s]  How's that?
[7888.87s -> 7891.71s]  Fire?
[7891.71s -> 7896.97s]  Is that good?
[7896.97s -> 7898.14s]  Yeah, that's robotic.
[7898.14s -> 7901.22s]  Hold on, what about this?
[7901.22s -> 7907.21s]  They come from far and wide to face off with the powerful Rhonda Dynamite.
[7907.21s -> 7908.70s]  No?
[7908.70s -> 7909.70s]  Does that sound bad?
[7909.70s -> 7915.10s]  How about I just do this?
[7915.10s -> 7920.52s]  They come from far and, I just, I can't.
[7920.52s -> 7925.46s]  They come from far and wide to face off with the powerful Rhonda Dynamite.
[7925.46s -> 7927.28s]  Rhonda Dynamite?
[7927.28s -> 7928.28s]  We sound pretty similar.
[7928.28s -> 7930.22s]  That's me.
[7930.22s -> 7931.72s]  Ready your weapon, Frog.
[7931.72s -> 7935.34s]  It's time for us to, can I reset?
[7935.34s -> 7943.20s]  Ready, ready, ready your weapon, Frog.
[7943.20s -> 7946.14s]  It is time for us to do battle.
[7946.14s -> 7950.22s]  I don't have a weapon and I'm not super interested in doing battle.
[7950.22s -> 7953.99s]  Then why are you here to face me?
[7953.99s -> 7957.07s]  This is my land.
[7957.07s -> 7961.28s]  You cannot just waltz in here and expect to take it.
[7961.28s -> 7962.28s]  Your land?
[7962.28s -> 7963.28s]  You own the scooter barn?
[7963.28s -> 7968.64s]  But I load up here every day.
[7968.64s -> 7970.33s]  Everybody knows.
[7970.33s -> 7972.66s]  Where have you been?
[7972.66s -> 7973.66s]  Do you live under a rock, Frog?
[7973.66s -> 7977.61s]  I thought a lily pad might be more suitable.
[7977.61s -> 7982.01s]  How much have you ever lost on acquaintance?
[7982.01s -> 7983.01s]  You call it.
[7983.01s -> 7986.36s]  You call it.
[7986.36s -> 7988.36s]  I live at 100 Skeleton Street, Slippery Pond.
[7988.36s -> 7996.15s]  That's not Bernie.
[7996.15s -> 7999.15s]  That's not, how is that, that's Kylo Ren?
[7999.15s -> 8000.39s]  No, it's not.
[8000.39s -> 8010.44s]  It's neither one of those two things.
[8010.44s -> 8012.44s]  Did you just give me your full address?
[8012.44s -> 8015.46s]  Yes.
[8015.46s -> 8017.76s]  You literally just met me.
[8017.76s -> 8019.45s]  Don't give your full address to strangers.
[8019.45s -> 8021.33s]  Why not?
[8021.33s -> 8024.91s]  How much are you going to know where I live?
[8024.91s -> 8028.14s]  You have a great point.
[8028.14s -> 8030.59s]  What?
[8030.59s -> 8031.59s]  The detective does not have a great point.
[8031.59s -> 8035.59s]  Do not give your address out to strangers unless your house is super cool and mega rich.
[8035.59s -> 8040.79s]  Then tell people where you live because how else are they going to know you live in a mansion?
[8040.79s -> 8042.79s]  Okay, even then just show them a photo.
[8042.79s -> 8044.16s]  Don't give it to them.
[8044.16s -> 8045.16s]  Thanks for playing.
[8045.16s -> 8047.17s]  I'll leave you to it.
[8047.17s -> 8048.17s]  Is this stream pre-recorded?
[8048.17s -> 8049.17s]  Nah.
[8049.17s -> 8053.33s]  Anyway, I'm not sure why you're trying to fight me.
[8053.33s -> 8056.21s]  Would you like me to leave?
[8056.21s -> 8061.65s]  I am enjoying having a nice company.
[8061.65s -> 8065.90s]  What do you do?
[8065.90s -> 8067.58s]  Hmm?
[8067.58s -> 8069.34s]  What do you do?
[8069.34s -> 8070.34s]  For a job.
[8070.34s -> 8072.41s]  Oh, I'm the detective.
[8072.41s -> 8074.41s]  I'm here to solve the case of the missing hats.
[8074.41s -> 8079.13s]  When you find the culprit, bring him here.
[8079.13s -> 8081.20s]  I'll beat them up.
[8081.20s -> 8083.34s]  What?
[8083.34s -> 8085.66s]  No.
[8085.66s -> 8089.78s]  Give them a taste of their faces.
[8089.78s -> 8091.28s]  Tie their shoes together and trip them up.
[8091.28s -> 8093.42s]  Tell them.
[8093.42s -> 8096.51s]  Please, no.
[8096.51s -> 8097.75s]  I'm an outlaw detective.
[8097.75s -> 8100.31s]  I hate it when people do the wrong thing.
[8100.31s -> 8103.77s]  That's the opposite of an outlaw.
[8103.77s -> 8109.40s]  I think this life isn't for me anymore.
[8109.40s -> 8111.73s]  Do you think so?
[8111.73s -> 8114.54s]  To be honest with you, detective.
[8114.54s -> 8115.72s]  I was meaning...
[8115.72s -> 8116.72s]  Why am I getting z...
[8116.72s -> 8117.72s]  Hold on.
[8117.72s -> 8124.10s]  To be honest with you, detective, I was meaning to apply for the sheriff's position.
[8124.10s -> 8126.10s]  Oh, it was filled just before I got here.
[8126.10s -> 8131.04s]  Yeah, I know.
[8131.04s -> 8132.04s]  Why some rendo?
[8132.04s -> 8136.76s]  His name is Mason Mole.
[8136.76s -> 8140.76s]  I'm sure Lobster Cop wouldn't have given the job just anyone.
[8140.76s -> 8141.76s]  He must be very qualified.
[8141.76s -> 8147.31s]  Doesn't mean he's not a rendo.
[8147.31s -> 8148.62s]  I suppose not.
[8148.62s -> 8152.52s]  What makes you want to be the sheriff?
[8152.52s -> 8153.52s]  I'm a natural leader.
[8153.52s -> 8154.89s]  I run the outlaw group.
[8154.89s -> 8155.89s]  Class and style.
[8155.89s -> 8157.26s]  And I love to help others.
[8157.26s -> 8160.90s]  Got a problem that needs solving?
[8160.90s -> 8162.14s]  I'm your girl.
[8162.14s -> 8164.09s]  And I'm tough.
[8164.09s -> 8165.52s]  No one is going to mess with me.
[8165.52s -> 8169.04s]  Wow, you sound like a great fit for the job.
[8175.08s -> 8177.08s]  Even putting it up your whole life, just call it.
[8177.08s -> 8178.58s]  I think so too.
[8178.58s -> 8179.58s]  But it's too late now.
[8179.58s -> 8180.58s]  Not necessarily.
[8180.58s -> 8182.58s]  You could always talk to Mason Mole.
[8182.58s -> 8184.01s]  Show him your expertise.
[8184.01s -> 8187.01s]  Maybe you could be co-sheriff.
[8187.01s -> 8189.83s]  That's a great idea.
[8189.83s -> 8191.83s]  Do you mind if I question you about the case I'm working on?
[8191.83s -> 8195.06s]  All right, your job.
[8195.06s -> 8196.06s]  What do you do?
[8196.06s -> 8197.87s]  What's going on here?
[8197.87s -> 8198.87s]  What kind of...
[8199.87s -> 8202.46s]  What kind of work do you do?
[8202.46s -> 8208.50s]  Well, detective, I'd love to tell you.
[8208.50s -> 8209.50s]  But I need to know how I can trust you.
[8209.50s -> 8211.83s]  Oh, I understand.
[8211.83s -> 8215.26s]  If you're worried about me telling on you, I won't tell.
[8215.26s -> 8217.26s]  My only concern today is the mystery of the missing hat.
[8217.26s -> 8221.59s]  If you've stolen the hat, I will totally tell on you though.
[8221.59s -> 8224.37s]  That's reasonable.
[8224.37s -> 8227.40s]  I'm a mouse with many skills.
[8227.40s -> 8229.58s]  I specialize in forgery and fraud.
[8229.58s -> 8232.65s]  Wow, sounds intense.
[8232.65s -> 8235.34s]  It's mostly a lot of printing stuff out.
[8235.34s -> 8238.62s]  I can forge all types of things.
[8238.62s -> 8239.80s]  Important documents.
[8239.80s -> 8240.80s]  Birth certificates.
[8240.80s -> 8241.80s]  IDs.
[8241.80s -> 8243.68s]  You name it.
[8243.68s -> 8247.68s]  Ooh, you could forge a certificate that says number one best detective?
[8247.68s -> 8251.03s]  No reason.
[8251.03s -> 8252.27s]  I'm just joking.
[8252.27s -> 8253.27s]  Pretend I didn't say that.
[8253.27s -> 8258.37s]  Mind if I question you about the case I'm working on?
[8258.37s -> 8261.08s]  All right, so wait.
[8261.08s -> 8262.08s]  I can get a fake ID, right?
[8262.08s -> 8265.86s]  How do you intend to become the sheriff?
[8265.86s -> 8267.80s]  By force.
[8267.80s -> 8273.80s]  I will simply beat up Mason Mole.
[8273.80s -> 8274.80s]  You can't do that.
[8274.80s -> 8276.66s]  Yes, I can.
[8276.66s -> 8278.10s]  I'm Rhonda Dynamite.
[8278.10s -> 8279.10s]  The rules do not apply to me.
[8279.10s -> 8283.94s]  What did Mason Mole ever do to you?
[8283.94s -> 8285.82s]  He's shifty.
[8285.82s -> 8287.70s]  Just don't trust his face.
[8287.70s -> 8288.70s]  Please don't take the role by force.
[8288.70s -> 8290.70s]  Have you tried submitting a resume?
[8290.70s -> 8292.65s]  A resume, you say?
[8292.65s -> 8297.28s]  Like a list of my skills and experiences?
[8297.28s -> 8300.28s]  Yeah, I think that would be a better option than beating up Sheriff Mason Mole.
[8300.28s -> 8304.77s]  That's fun, though.
[8304.77s -> 8306.77s]  I don't really have the writing supplies for making a resume.
[8306.77s -> 8311.58s]  If I had paper and stuff, I would be managing it.
[8311.58s -> 8312.58s]  I can get you the writing supplies.
[8312.58s -> 8314.58s]  Just please don't beat up the sheriff.
[8314.58s -> 8318.44s]  I was just thinking about it.
[8318.44s -> 8321.51s]  Mind if I question you about the case?
[8321.51s -> 8323.94s]  All right, so we got to get something to write.
[8323.94s -> 8339.38s]  We got to get writing tools to write a resume and learn some nonviolent conflict resolution skills.
[8339.38s -> 8340.62s]  Wants to fight me?
[8340.62s -> 8341.62s]  No, wait.
[8343.63s -> 8344.63s]  That was my full address.
[8344.63s -> 8348.94s]  Dreams of being the sheriff.
[8348.94s -> 8349.94s]  Okay, sounds good.
[8349.94s -> 8351.94s]  Do you have anything over here I can look at?
[8351.94s -> 8367.80s]  Who wanted the four flowers?
[8367.80s -> 8368.80s]  Did anybody want that yet?
[8368.80s -> 8376.34s]  Fake ID, left alone, proof of ghost, amuse.
[8376.34s -> 8377.96s]  Does that work?
[8377.96s -> 8379.84s]  Oh, cactus flower.
[8379.84s -> 8380.84s]  Okay.
[8380.84s -> 8381.84s]  Bonnie.
[8381.84s -> 8383.27s]  Bonnie needs it.
[8383.27s -> 8387.97s]  I have got.
[8387.97s -> 8389.97s]  I completely forget this voice.
[8389.97s -> 8390.97s]  I have no idea what it was.
[8390.97s -> 8391.97s]  I completely forget.
[8391.97s -> 8396.69s]  Can I ask you some questions?
[8396.69s -> 8400.74s]  Cactus flowers.
[8400.74s -> 8401.74s]  I've just been flower picking.
[8401.74s -> 8403.62s]  Great.
[8403.62s -> 8406.81s]  Here's what I've collected so far.
[8406.81s -> 8407.81s]  I'll add them to the stew.
[8407.81s -> 8411.69s]  I really wish you told me that the cactus flowers are so hard to get.
[8411.69s -> 8415.19s]  I nearly pricked myself.
[8415.19s -> 8416.19s]  Did you?
[8416.19s -> 8417.43s]  That's so funny.
[8417.43s -> 8420.36s]  It's not funny at all.
[8420.36s -> 8421.36s]  It's hilarious.
[8421.36s -> 8423.37s]  It's not hilarious.
[8423.37s -> 8427.96s]  That would have hurt.
[8427.96s -> 8429.26s]  Up, up, up, up.
[8429.26s -> 8431.14s]  Yeah, it would have.
[8431.14s -> 8433.14s]  Good thing I managed to find some gloves.
[8433.14s -> 8435.77s]  Ew, like secondhand gloves?
[8435.77s -> 8440.68s]  First and secondhand, yep.
[8440.68s -> 8441.68s]  Well, thanks for getting them.
[8441.68s -> 8443.11s]  No problem.
[8443.11s -> 8445.57s]  Ooh.
[8445.57s -> 8449.24s]  What did I get?
[8449.24s -> 8450.24s]  Oh, what else has to go in the stew?
[8450.24s -> 8451.48s]  Nothing else, right?
[8451.48s -> 8461.36s]  Cool.
[8461.36s -> 8463.37s]  All right.
[8463.37s -> 8464.37s]  The graveyard is haunted.
[8464.37s -> 8467.46s]  It needs a key.
[8467.46s -> 8468.46s]  This gate needs a key.
[8468.46s -> 8472.28s]  Perhaps I should find one and get lobster cops to help open it.
[8472.28s -> 8473.28s]  Oh, carrots.
[8473.28s -> 8477.91s]  Right, right, right, right.
[8477.91s -> 8478.91s]  All right.
[8478.91s -> 8480.92s]  You need writing utensils.
[8480.92s -> 8481.92s]  You need a muse.
[8481.92s -> 8485.38s]  We have not even spoken to you.
[8485.38s -> 8489.11s]  I just...
[8489.11s -> 8502.45s]  Somebody said don't do Trump.
[8502.45s -> 8503.45s]  You just fucked me up.
[8503.45s -> 8510.71s]  I literally read do not do Trump in all capitals when I said the first two lines.
[8510.71s -> 8513.74s]  Okay.
[8513.74s -> 8516.65s]  Do it.
[8516.65s -> 8517.65s]  Now, yeah.
[8517.65s -> 8519.34s]  All right.
[8519.34s -> 8522.30s]  Good afternoon.
[8522.30s -> 8524.30s]  Welcome to Cowboy County General Store.
[8524.30s -> 8525.54s]  My name is Wendy.
[8525.54s -> 8529.62s]  We have a wide range of general goods for purchase.
[8529.62s -> 8531.82s]  Hi.
[8531.82s -> 8532.82s]  I'm Frog Detective.
[8532.82s -> 8536.82s]  Unfortunately, at this time, we don't stock any gear for detective work.
[8536.82s -> 8537.82s]  I mean, it's some of the best.
[8537.82s -> 8538.82s]  Some of the best gear.
[8538.82s -> 8540.19s]  We don't have it.
[8540.19s -> 8542.52s]  I don't need anything.
[8542.52s -> 8549.50s]  Um, please feel free to browse our expansive selection.
[8549.50s -> 8551.74s]  I'm sure you'll find what you need.
[8551.74s -> 8552.74s]  Believe me.
[8552.74s -> 8554.94s]  No, thank you.
[8554.94s -> 8557.58s]  No, thank you.
[8557.58s -> 8561.58s]  We have a wide range of general goods for purchase.
[8561.58s -> 8564.04s]  Yes.
[8564.04s -> 8568.56s]  Do you need a specific item that isn't in stock?
[8568.56s -> 8575.09s]  We process special orders at no extra cost to the consumer.
[8575.09s -> 8579.09s]  And I mean, the consumer is obviously the most important thing that we have here.
[8579.09s -> 8582.50s]  I don't really need anything.
[8582.50s -> 8586.51s]  Special orders have an average two-day turnaround.
[8586.51s -> 8590.51s]  And by the way, the special interests that are fighting against me, believe me.
[8590.51s -> 8591.51s]  Yeah.
[8591.51s -> 8594.48s]  Fake news media.
[8594.48s -> 8597.32s]  Stick with them.
[8597.32s -> 8600.74s]  That's a great turnaround.
[8600.74s -> 8601.74s]  We have many great policies.
[8601.74s -> 8604.06s]  Such as?
[8604.06s -> 8609.33s]  We're proud to offer our customers a satisfaction guarantee on all purchases.
[8609.33s -> 8614.90s]  What's a satisfaction guarantee?
[8614.90s -> 8621.10s]  We can guarantee that you will be either satisfied or dissatisfied with your purchase.
[8621.10s -> 8624.94s]  What happens if I'm dissatisfied?
[8624.94s -> 8628.07s]  That falls within our satisfaction guarantee.
[8628.07s -> 8632.10s]  If I can get a refund?
[8632.10s -> 8634.10s]  This impression sucks.
[8634.10s -> 8639.10s]  You can't say that.
[8639.10s -> 8640.10s]  All right.
[8640.10s -> 8641.10s]  Let me tell you something.
[8641.10s -> 8642.10s]  You can't say that.
[8642.10s -> 8644.53s]  Ten minutes into an impression.
[8644.53s -> 8647.79s]  You got to stop me immediately.
[8647.79s -> 8648.79s]  You got to stop me immediately.
[8648.79s -> 8649.79s]  Hey, hey, man.
[8649.79s -> 8650.79s]  I got an impression for you.
[8650.79s -> 8651.79s]  Oh, here we go.
[8651.79s -> 8652.79s]  Let me tell you something.
[8652.79s -> 8653.79s]  My name is Donald Trump.
[8653.79s -> 8654.79s]  And let me talk to you.
[8654.79s -> 8657.79s]  And you just sit there and nod for ten minutes.
[8657.79s -> 8658.79s]  Yeah.
[8658.79s -> 8659.97s]  Yeah.
[8659.97s -> 8660.97s]  Mm-hmm.
[8660.97s -> 8661.97s]  And by the way, the special interests.
[8661.97s -> 8662.97s]  Yeah.
[8662.97s -> 8663.97s]  Mm-hmm.
[8663.97s -> 8664.97s]  Mm-hmm.
[8664.97s -> 8666.34s]  Mm-hmm.
[8666.34s -> 8670.34s]  So, and then eventually after eight straight minutes, you go, hey, I just want to cut you off for a second.
[8670.34s -> 8671.34s]  This is bad.
[8671.34s -> 8676.65s]  It's like, man, you let me do my whole routine.
[8676.65s -> 8678.65s]  You let me do my entire routine.
[8678.65s -> 8682.06s]  Can I get a refund?
[8682.06s -> 8689.97s]  The satisfaction guarantee only guarantees a range of satisfaction from dissatisfied to satisfied.
[8689.97s -> 8697.02s]  If you're feeling towards the product doesn't fall within that range, you're entitled to a refund.
[8697.02s -> 8699.03s]  That clears it up.
[8699.03s -> 8702.06s]  Thanks.
[8702.06s -> 8705.33s]  Anyway, I'm actually here to ask some questions about the case.
[8705.33s -> 8708.33s]  Unfortunately, we don't have cases in stock at this time.
[8708.33s -> 8711.50s]  And now it's kind of turning into what is this?
[8711.50s -> 8715.74s]  I don't know why there's extra S's and H's at the end of this now.
[8715.74s -> 8716.74s]  Why?
[8716.74s -> 8720.10s]  What is it turning into?
[8720.10s -> 8724.06s]  The mystery, I mean, of the Stonehats.
[8724.06s -> 8728.50s]  Stealing is not permitted at Cowboy County General Store.
[8728.50s -> 8729.99s]  I would know.
[8729.99s -> 8730.99s]  I know.
[8730.99s -> 8731.99s]  Trust me.
[8731.99s -> 8732.99s]  If there's anybody that knows about this, it's me.
[8732.99s -> 8734.99s]  Nobody knows this better than I do.
[8734.99s -> 8735.99s]  Nobody knows this better than me.
[8735.99s -> 8739.55s]  Nobody knows the County General Store better than I do.
[8739.55s -> 8744.63s]  Okay?
[8744.63s -> 8751.86s]  This is SNL Trump.
[8751.86s -> 8754.36s]  It's not permitted anywhere, really.
[8754.36s -> 8757.36s]  To be clear, I'm not here to purchase or steal any items from your store.
[8757.36s -> 8759.18s]  It's Cartman.
[8759.18s -> 8762.98s]  Yeah.
[8762.98s -> 8765.05s]  But whatever.
[8765.05s -> 8766.05s]  It's all right.
[8766.05s -> 8772.26s]  I'm here in official business to solve the mystery of the Stonehats in Cowboy County.
[8772.26s -> 8774.33s]  Right.
[8774.33s -> 8777.33s]  It would have been a lot easier for me if you'd said that in the first place.
[8777.33s -> 8786.78s]  I feel like Crooked Hillary just spent so much time explaining the policies and values of my store.
[8786.78s -> 8789.98s]  It's been embarrassing for me, really.
[8789.98s -> 8790.98s]  Really.
[8790.98s -> 8791.98s]  Believe me, really.
[8791.98s -> 8796.80s]  Like, maybe in future, just tell people what you're here for.
[8796.80s -> 8798.80s]  You know, just tell people what you're here for.
[8798.80s -> 8800.80s]  I mean, what do you want me to say?
[8800.80s -> 8803.13s]  Yes, absolutely right.
[8803.13s -> 8806.78s]  I'm not good at communicating quickly.
[8806.78s -> 8807.78s]  I get easily swept up in conversation.
[8807.78s -> 8808.78s]  Sorry.
[8808.78s -> 8813.55s]  Ever since you started doing the Trump impression, the viewer count has gone down.
[8813.55s -> 8815.82s]  Weakness.
[8815.82s -> 8829.25s]  Hey, if you can't handle me at my Eric Cartman SNL Trump impression,
[8829.25s -> 8833.88s]  then you do not deserve me at my Frog Detective.
[8834.88s -> 8835.88s]  You know what I'm saying?
[8835.88s -> 8840.38s]  Quick, double down.
[8840.38s -> 8841.38s]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[8841.38s -> 8843.71s]  It's fine.
[8843.71s -> 8845.89s]  I just feel a bit self-conscious.
[8845.89s -> 8846.89s]  No, no, you did great.
[8846.89s -> 8850.64s]  I learned a lot about you and your store policies.
[8850.64s -> 8853.52s]  I'm glad to hear that.
[8853.52s -> 8855.52s]  It hasn't been easy taking over the shop.
[8855.52s -> 8858.14s]  You seem like an old hand at it.
[8858.14s -> 8860.92s]  That's great.
[8860.92s -> 8861.92s]  I'm not at all.
[8861.92s -> 8866.81s]  I've only been running the shop for seven months.
[8866.81s -> 8871.31s]  Oh, cool.
[8871.31s -> 8873.31s]  Can I ask you some questions?
[8873.31s -> 8880.30s]  New job.
[8880.30s -> 8882.30s]  So you just started running the shop.
[8882.30s -> 8883.30s]  How is it all going?
[8883.30s -> 8887.11s]  I wish I could say I'm nailing it, but honestly, I'm nailing it.
[8887.11s -> 8889.11s]  Who's to say I'm not?
[8889.11s -> 8891.11s]  Nobody nails it better than I do.
[8891.11s -> 8893.11s]  Doesn't feel like that most of the time, but it is.
[8893.11s -> 8898.09s]  That's no good.
[8898.09s -> 8900.09s]  The shop has been in my family for generations.
[8900.09s -> 8903.09s]  I thought in my hands, it would be the best it's ever been.
[8903.09s -> 8905.39s]  But it's just kind of the same.
[8905.39s -> 8906.39s]  The same is good.
[8906.39s -> 8907.39s]  At least it's not worse than it was.
[8907.39s -> 8909.82s]  I suppose you're right, Kyle.
[8909.82s -> 8914.62s]  Is there anything that would boost your confidence?
[8914.62s -> 8919.51s]  Well, Kyle, there's one thing.
[8919.51s -> 8920.51s]  What's that?
[8920.51s -> 8927.77s]  Do you see these portraits on the wall?
[8927.77s -> 8929.39s]  They're lovely.
[8929.39s -> 8932.39s]  Every shop owner in my family has had a beautiful portrait
[8932.39s -> 8934.39s]  created of them, except for me.
[8934.39s -> 8937.39s]  Big, beautiful portrait with a big, beautiful door.
[8937.39s -> 8939.76s]  Big, beautiful door on it, you know.
[8939.76s -> 8940.76s]  Believe me.
[8940.76s -> 8941.76s]  Except for me.
[8941.76s -> 8943.38s]  Mine's a silly photo.
[8943.38s -> 8947.57s]  I don't like it.
[8947.57s -> 8957.03s]  Suck my bow, Kyle.
[8957.03s -> 8961.34s]  He's definitely high.
[8961.34s -> 8962.34s]  I am fine.
[8962.34s -> 8963.34s]  I am not.
[8963.34s -> 8964.34s]  I promise you.
[8964.34s -> 8967.50s]  Yeah, sure.
[8967.50s -> 8968.50s]  But it's not the same.
[8968.50s -> 8969.68s]  I haven't got the slightest idea.
[8969.68s -> 8973.68s]  And then, obviously, when mom or dad is sick of doing the voice reading
[8973.68s -> 8977.86s]  the story to the children, it becomes kind of like a half-assed version
[8977.86s -> 8979.86s]  of what it was in the first two seconds, right?
[8979.86s -> 8982.67s]  I haven't got the slightest idea how I'm supposed to get someone
[8982.67s -> 8983.67s]  to create a beautiful portrait.
[8983.67s -> 8985.67s]  I don't even know who painted those ones.
[8985.67s -> 8988.04s]  Have you tried painting one yourself?
[8988.04s -> 8989.28s]  With what time?
[8989.28s -> 8991.28s]  And besides, art was never my strong suit.
[8991.28s -> 8993.10s]  Maybe you could paint it for me.
[8993.10s -> 8995.23s]  I wish.
[8995.23s -> 8996.23s]  I'm not much of a painter.
[8996.23s -> 9000.54s]  Well, if you find anyone that wants to paint me,
[9000.54s -> 9004.54s]  can you let me know and let me tell me exactly?
[9004.54s -> 9005.54s]  I'm done.
[9005.54s -> 9007.90s]  How are they supposed to know if they want to paint you
[9007.90s -> 9008.90s]  if they can't see you?
[9008.90s -> 9011.21s]  Here, take this photo of me.
[9011.21s -> 9013.90s]  Okay, kind of weird.
[9013.90s -> 9014.90s]  What's weird, Ka?
[9014.90s -> 9017.46s]  Just carrying around a photo of you on the off chance
[9017.46s -> 9019.46s]  that I find a painter who can paint you a portrait.
[9019.46s -> 9023.04s]  You have not absorbed any of this, have you?
[9023.04s -> 9024.04s]  No, none.
[9024.04s -> 9025.04s]  Literally, I don't even know what the conversation has been.
[9025.04s -> 9030.26s]  I've just bonetically been pronouncing words.
[9030.26s -> 9031.26s]  I don't know what...
[9031.26s -> 9032.26s]  I have no...
[9032.26s -> 9034.26s]  If you offered me a million dollars to tell you what happened in here,
[9034.26s -> 9036.82s]  I wouldn't be able to do it.
[9036.82s -> 9040.64s]  You could open up a briefcase with stacks of 10 grand
[9040.64s -> 9044.01s]  and I would say, I'm sorry, I have no fucking idea what just happened.
[9044.01s -> 9047.04s]  I'm sorry.
[9047.04s -> 9050.43s]  I don't think that's weird.
[9050.43s -> 9051.67s]  Okay, sorry.
[9051.67s -> 9055.49s]  All right, so we got to get, I think, the painter.
[9055.49s -> 9059.42s]  That makes sense.
[9059.42s -> 9066.35s]  Well, that would be right.
[9066.35s -> 9068.30s]  Oh, shit.
[9068.30s -> 9069.30s]  I made a million dollars.
[9069.30s -> 9072.69s]  All right, let's go give it to the painter.
[9072.69s -> 9081.71s]  Who would pay you a million dollars?
[9081.71s -> 9089.30s]  Well, it's just a large sum of money to make a point.
[9089.30s -> 9090.93s]  You know what I'm saying?
[9090.93s -> 9096.82s]  No, kitty, this is my pot path.
[9096.82s -> 9103.75s]  Oh, look at that.
[9103.75s -> 9105.18s]  Can I buy these carrots?
[9105.18s -> 9106.62s]  You have money.
[9106.62s -> 9108.62s]  I sure do.
[9108.62s -> 9110.50s]  Okay, no need to brag.
[9110.50s -> 9111.50s]  Take as many as you need.
[9111.50s -> 9113.25s]  Thanks.
[9113.25s -> 9116.02s]  This goes in the stew.
[9116.02s -> 9121.81s]  Mmm.
[9127.85s -> 9136.58s]  Where?
[9136.58s -> 9137.58s]  Oh, you're, no, they're in the saloon, right?
[9137.58s -> 9142.57s]  Carrot appreciation rant incoming.
[9142.57s -> 9143.57s]  I mean, carrots are amazing.
[9143.57s -> 9144.57s]  They go in everything.
[9144.57s -> 9152.52s]  I want you to name me a, name me a food, like a stew or a side dish.
[9152.52s -> 9158.02s]  Name me a dish that you've eaten where you didn't want the carrots on the plate.
[9158.02s -> 9160.22s]  I can't tell you one.
[9160.22s -> 9163.76s]  No, no, no, no.
[9163.76s -> 9164.76s]  I'm not talking weird shit.
[9164.76s -> 9166.76s]  Not, oh, put carrots on pizza.
[9166.76s -> 9174.31s]  Dishes that have carrots in it, they, I would never want them removed.
[9174.31s -> 9179.20s]  Hmm.
[9179.20s -> 9180.20s]  Can I ask you some questions?
[9180.20s -> 9181.57s]  Go ahead.
[9181.57s -> 9186.62s]  I found a photograph for you to paint.
[9186.62s -> 9188.06s]  Oh.
[9188.06s -> 9189.06s]  Can I see it?
[9189.06s -> 9190.42s]  Here you go.
[9190.42s -> 9192.99s]  Hmm.
[9192.99s -> 9194.81s]  Wow.
[9194.81s -> 9195.81s]  This is beautiful.
[9195.81s -> 9198.99s]  Is this Wendy from the store?
[9198.99s -> 9199.99s]  It sure is.
[9199.99s -> 9203.00s]  It would be my absolute pleasure to paint this.
[9203.00s -> 9204.56s]  I did it.
[9204.56s -> 9206.31s]  What?
[9206.31s -> 9208.26s]  I lifted the witch's curse.
[9208.26s -> 9210.71s]  I mean, I guess.
[9210.71s -> 9214.34s]  Seems like it was probably a prank.
[9214.34s -> 9217.02s]  Oh, I thought you said it was scary.
[9217.02s -> 9220.10s]  I don't think I said that.
[9220.10s -> 9221.72s]  I'm really brave.
[9221.72s -> 9222.72s]  Doesn't seem like something I would say.
[9222.72s -> 9225.75s]  Right.
[9225.75s -> 9226.75s]  I must be mistaken.
[9226.75s -> 9228.50s]  It's okay.
[9228.50s -> 9231.75s]  We all make mistakes.
[9231.75s -> 9234.06s]  Well, not me so much.
[9234.06s -> 9237.00s]  Will this work as your new muse?
[9237.00s -> 9240.06s]  Absolutely.
[9240.06s -> 9241.06s]  Stay right there.
[9241.06s -> 9252.56s]  I'm going to paint it immediately.
[9252.56s -> 9253.56s]  Oh, it's cute.
[9253.56s -> 9255.50s]  And voila.
[9255.50s -> 9257.06s]  Wow.
[9257.06s -> 9258.56s]  It's beautiful.
[9258.56s -> 9259.56s]  Thank you.
[9259.56s -> 9260.56s]  I'm so proud of it.
[9260.56s -> 9263.74s]  What are you going to do with it now?
[9263.74s -> 9265.74s]  Oh, this is just a warmup for me.
[9265.74s -> 9268.43s]  You can keep this portrait if you'd like.
[9268.43s -> 9269.93s]  Really?
[9269.93s -> 9271.94s]  Yeah.
[9271.94s -> 9273.37s]  Or throw it out.
[9273.37s -> 9275.72s]  I don't mind.
[9275.72s -> 9277.72s]  I'm just happy I got my talent back.
[9277.72s -> 9281.37s]  The talent was inside you all along.
[9281.37s -> 9285.51s]  No, it wasn't.
[9285.51s -> 9286.51s]  Okay.
[9286.51s -> 9297.61s]  That's a sad.
[9297.61s -> 9298.61s]  That is sad.
[9298.61s -> 9304.44s]  Yeah.
[9304.44s -> 9305.44s]  All right.
[9305.44s -> 9306.44s]  We got more things to deliver.
[9306.44s -> 9309.45s]  I can put the carrots in.
[9309.45s -> 9316.47s]  Let's finish the stew.
[9316.47s -> 9317.71s]  Okay.
[9317.71s -> 9321.51s]  Here you go.
[9321.51s -> 9323.51s]  I managed to prepare some carrots for your stew.
[9323.51s -> 9325.52s]  You're the best detective.
[9325.52s -> 9328.08s]  How did you even manage that?
[9328.08s -> 9330.83s]  I simply went next door and bought some.
[9330.83s -> 9331.83s]  That's so cool.
[9331.83s -> 9334.31s]  I'll add them to the stew now.
[9334.31s -> 9335.31s]  Hey, would you look at that?
[9335.31s -> 9336.74s]  What?
[9336.74s -> 9340.12s]  You got all the ingredients.
[9340.12s -> 9342.12s]  I mean, it was a pretty simple task.
[9342.12s -> 9344.68s]  I'm so proud of you.
[9344.68s -> 9347.33s]  What's wrong?
[9347.33s -> 9350.08s]  Here's a little condescending.
[9350.08s -> 9353.66s]  What's condescending about being proud of you?
[9353.66s -> 9356.99s]  All I did was pick some flowers and go to the store.
[9356.99s -> 9360.75s]  That's more than I did.
[9360.75s -> 9362.50s]  I suppose.
[9362.50s -> 9363.50s]  Just give me a second.
[9363.50s -> 9365.51s]  I'll finish up the stew and give you some.
[9365.51s -> 9366.51s]  Great.
[9366.51s -> 9367.51s]  Thanks.
[9367.51s -> 9369.26s]  I reckon I could give this to Laptocop.
[9369.26s -> 9382.09s]  Do whatever you want.
[9382.09s -> 9385.09s]  Carrots are Satan's belt-tipped pen.
[9385.09s -> 9391.22s]  That's actually kind of a...
[9391.22s -> 9393.22s]  That was a very eloquent way to put that.
[9393.22s -> 9395.22s]  Even though I don't agree with you.
[9395.22s -> 9398.98s]  That was masterfully written.
[9398.98s -> 9401.98s]  That was a masterfully written statement.
[9401.98s -> 9404.47s]  Stop saying right.
[9404.47s -> 9410.42s]  I gotta get that out of my system.
[9410.42s -> 9412.42s]  That cadence, I'm so aware of it now.
[9412.42s -> 9425.54s]  I like this little worm.
[9425.54s -> 9429.00s]  You say like a lot.
[9429.00s -> 9430.00s]  You say write a lot.
[9430.00s -> 9432.00s]  I say you know what I mean a lot.
[9432.00s -> 9434.00s]  I say okay.
[9434.00s -> 9436.00s]  You know what I mean?
[9436.00s -> 9437.00s]  Okay.
[9437.00s -> 9438.00s]  Hear me out on this.
[9438.00s -> 9443.90s]  I have like four ways to start or stop a sentence.
[9443.90s -> 9450.43s]  It's kind of my version of saying over.
[9450.43s -> 9453.98s]  Yeah.
[9453.98s -> 9454.98s]  Back the truck up a little bit.
[9454.98s -> 9457.43s]  Over.
[9457.43s -> 9458.43s]  Yeah.
[9458.43s -> 9459.43s]  It looks like we have a...
[9459.43s -> 9461.25s]  Well, the supply is doing pretty good.
[9461.25s -> 9462.25s]  Over.
[9462.25s -> 9466.75s]  That's how you know that I'm done with that sentence.
[9466.75s -> 9467.93s]  All right.
[9467.93s -> 9468.93s]  So we got that.
[9468.93s -> 9477.02s]  Oh.
[9477.02s -> 9486.00s]  Fake ID.
[9486.00s -> 9487.18s]  What do I do with the shovel?
[9487.18s -> 9489.18s]  Let me give the stew to the Laptocop.
[9489.18s -> 9498.42s]  Oh.
[9498.42s -> 9500.87s]  Are you finished?
[9500.87s -> 9501.87s]  Did you find all the things I asked for?
[9501.87s -> 9504.90s]  Oh.
[9504.90s -> 9508.13s]  I'm still looking.
[9508.13s -> 9514.44s]  You also say what do you want about and let me tell you something right now.
[9514.44s -> 9515.44s]  Yeah.
[9515.44s -> 9525.90s]  I do.
[9525.90s -> 9528.16s]  Oh.
[9528.16s -> 9529.16s]  It's a map.
[9529.16s -> 9540.96s]  Oh.
[9540.96s -> 9541.96s]  I needed that.
[9541.96s -> 9542.96s]  Okay.
[9542.96s -> 9547.34s]  So there's a well that I haven't been to.
[9547.34s -> 9549.09s]  I went to the mine.
[9549.09s -> 9550.09s]  I got the shovel.
[9550.09s -> 9552.16s]  Crime scene map meal.
[9552.16s -> 9554.74s]  All right.
[9554.74s -> 9555.74s]  So I have the meal.
[9555.74s -> 9556.74s]  Let me go to that well.
[9556.74s -> 9562.78s]  That well is down the road here.
[9562.78s -> 9563.78s]  And okay.
[9563.78s -> 9565.66s]  Around here.
[9565.66s -> 9566.66s]  Yeah.
[9566.66s -> 9567.66s]  I do say like a lot.
[9567.66s -> 9568.66s]  I'm really aware of that.
[9568.66s -> 9569.90s]  I think the reason why I say like a lot is not that the vocabulary is not there.
[9569.90s -> 9572.90s]  It's just my brain almost has to be a hard drive and find it.
[9572.90s -> 9576.51s]  It's kind of...
[9576.51s -> 9580.31s]  Whenever I say the word, whenever I say like, you can see the hard drive blinking light
[9580.31s -> 9581.31s]  on the back of my head.
[9581.31s -> 9582.62s]  Go.
[9582.62s -> 9589.95s]  Like I have my vocabulary is there.
[9589.95s -> 9592.96s]  It's just a search for it.
[9592.96s -> 9609.22s]  This is well.
[9609.22s -> 9610.22s]  It's a filler word.
[9610.22s -> 9613.32s]  Yeah.
[9613.32s -> 9615.32s]  It's actually kind of funny because I've been a little more conscious of it recently.
[9615.32s -> 9617.65s]  I try.
[9617.65s -> 9620.65s]  I try to not say like filler.
[9620.65s -> 9621.65s]  Ah, there it is.
[9621.65s -> 9629.18s]  I try to not say filler words if I can help it.
[9629.18s -> 9634.80s]  I can't get down there without a ladder and I'd fall and break my legs and arms and knees
[9634.80s -> 9642.90s]  and my head and nostrils and fingers.
[9642.90s -> 9643.90s]  Break your nostrils.
[9643.90s -> 9648.60s]  All right.
[9648.60s -> 9650.48s]  So I need a ladder.
[9650.48s -> 9651.48s]  I can't do that yet.
[9651.48s -> 9659.06s]  What do I do with the shovel?
[9659.06s -> 9665.61s]  Hmm.
[9665.61s -> 9670.94s]  What did you want?
[9670.94s -> 9677.11s]  Oh, the portrait.
[9677.11s -> 9683.64s]  So you're not going to believe this.
[9683.64s -> 9685.38s]  I believe it.
[9685.38s -> 9687.51s]  What is it?
[9687.51s -> 9690.10s]  I meant to get you a portrait.
[9690.10s -> 9692.30s]  Seriously?
[9692.30s -> 9693.30s]  Yep.
[9693.30s -> 9697.88s]  Pestle the panther saw your photo and he thought you were the perfect muse.
[9697.88s -> 9699.63s]  Get that?
[9699.63s -> 9701.64s]  How about me?
[9701.64s -> 9703.46s]  He sure did.
[9703.46s -> 9704.46s]  Can I?
[9704.46s -> 9705.46s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[9705.46s -> 9706.46s]  Ow.
[9706.46s -> 9707.63s]  By the way, I'm moving my hands around.
[9707.63s -> 9708.94s]  I'm doing the thing.
[9708.94s -> 9714.63s]  I'm putting my palms up, putting my right hand forward, back, putting both palms up, putting
[9714.63s -> 9719.22s]  right hand forward, right hand back, right hand forward, right hand back.
[9719.22s -> 9721.42s]  I have to do that.
[9721.42s -> 9726.09s]  My mouth is going like this and I'm putting my hands up and right now my right hand just
[9726.09s -> 9731.75s]  went up, forward and then back and then forward again.
[9731.75s -> 9735.30s]  I think you have to do that.
[9735.30s -> 9739.78s]  Doing a Trump impression, if I sit here and just do it without the motions, I won't be
[9739.78s -> 9747.16s]  able to do it.
[9747.16s -> 9756.08s]  Okay.
[9756.08s -> 9757.38s]  Let's hang it up.
[9757.38s -> 9758.69s]  Wow.
[9758.69s -> 9759.93s]  Wow.
[9759.93s -> 9761.23s]  It's huge.
[9761.23s -> 9762.47s]  This is huge.
[9762.47s -> 9763.47s]  Pistol is so talented.
[9763.47s -> 9766.31s]  How much do I owe him?
[9766.31s -> 9767.31s]  No charge.
[9767.31s -> 9768.67s]  He was just glad to be free of the witch's cyberspace curse.
[9770.67s -> 9772.30s]  Sorry.
[9772.30s -> 9773.30s]  What?
[9773.30s -> 9775.05s]  It's a whole thing.
[9775.05s -> 9776.05s]  Don't worry about it.
[9776.05s -> 9778.57s]  Painting isn't cursed, is it?
[9778.57s -> 9780.64s]  I don't think so.
[9780.64s -> 9782.14s]  Well, good.
[9782.14s -> 9784.26s]  Thank you so much for getting this portrait for me, detective.
[9784.26s -> 9785.75s]  Appreciate it.
[9785.75s -> 9789.46s]  It was no problem at all.
[9789.46s -> 9791.46s]  Well, frankly, it was huge.
[9791.46s -> 9792.46s]  What can I give you for the trouble?
[9792.46s -> 9793.46s]  Let me see.
[9793.46s -> 9794.46s]  Let me think.
[9794.46s -> 9796.59s]  Oh, I know.
[9796.59s -> 9797.59s]  Take this ladder.
[9797.59s -> 9801.71s]  There it is.
[9801.71s -> 9803.59s]  Nice.
[9803.59s -> 9805.73s]  Now we go down the well.
[9805.73s -> 9806.93s]  You barely notice you're holding it.
[9806.93s -> 9809.58s]  I promise.
[9809.58s -> 9810.58s]  If you say so.
[9810.58s -> 9812.20s]  Thanks.
[9812.20s -> 9813.20s]  It's the best ladder.
[9813.20s -> 9821.96s]  I fell asleep for a second.
[9822.20s -> 9831.57s]  What's going on?
[9831.57s -> 9832.57s]  I think you missed a lot.
[9832.57s -> 9833.57s]  How long did you fall asleep for?
[9833.57s -> 9836.66s]  Yeah.
[9836.66s -> 9837.66s]  Good morning or good night.
[9837.66s -> 9838.66s]  Well, no.
[9838.66s -> 9841.31s]  You might have just taken a nap.
[9841.31s -> 9846.28s]  There have been tons of times where I've just kind of conked out for a little bit.
[9846.28s -> 9847.28s]  20 minutes.
[9847.28s -> 9858.57s]  30 minutes.
[9858.57s -> 9860.05s]  Hey, this ladder is perfect for climbing down as well.
[9860.05s -> 9863.91s]  Lucky me.
[9863.91s -> 9866.51s]  Ooh, a key.
[9866.51s -> 9868.39s]  We need it.
[9868.39s -> 9877.63s]  Close that book.
[9877.63s -> 9879.31s]  People are so careless nowadays.
[9879.31s -> 9880.31s]  Ever heard of a keychain?
[9880.31s -> 9882.26s]  I'll take this with me.
[9882.26s -> 9884.90s]  I got two items.
[9884.90s -> 9891.14s]  I can't nap.
[9891.14s -> 9894.81s]  I'm either awake or conked out for nine hours.
[9894.81s -> 9901.36s]  The problem that I have is I will put my head down and I will nap for 20 to 30 minutes.
[9901.36s -> 9903.60s]  I will wake up still lying down.
[9903.60s -> 9911.34s]  My body will wake up and I'm so just so comfortable and so sleepy that I say to myself, I don't
[9911.34s -> 9912.93s]  give a shit.
[9912.93s -> 9921.71s]  And then I close my eyes again and then I sleep for eight plus hours.
[9921.71s -> 9923.54s]  It's hard to nap.
[9923.54s -> 9928.05s]  Those of you that can actually get up, you are incredibly strong.
[9928.05s -> 9929.05s]  Don't ever think you're not.
[9929.05s -> 9930.35s]  I'm serious.
[9930.35s -> 9934.30s]  You were able to just get right up after taking a little nap.
[9934.30s -> 9937.42s]  You are very strong.
[9937.42s -> 9938.70s]  You're very strong, Will.
[9938.70s -> 9940.77s]  You do.
[9940.77s -> 9942.25s]  It's a really fucking hard thing to do.
[9942.25s -> 9958.46s]  Not only is this ladder perfect for climbing down, I can also see you going up there.
[9958.46s -> 9965.52s]  Lucky me.
[9965.52s -> 9968.58s]  You just called me weak.
[9968.58s -> 9973.16s]  No, you're probably strong in other ways.
[9973.16s -> 9979.39s]  See?
[9979.39s -> 9984.77s]  Bro, I think you have sleep apnea.
[9984.77s -> 9993.83s]  I definitely don't have sleep apnea.
[9993.83s -> 9994.83s]  I don't think so.
[9994.83s -> 10002.28s]  All right.
[10002.28s -> 10003.28s]  We got the key.
[10004.75s -> 10006.43s]  I need to do something with the shovel.
[10006.43s -> 10012.10s]  OK, is the shovel a criminal tool?
[10012.10s -> 10020.22s]  Do I have everything that is that technically a criminal tool?
[10020.22s -> 10023.71s]  Now we need the fake ID.
[10023.71s -> 10024.71s]  All right.
[10024.71s -> 10026.08s]  So we need somebody to give it.
[10026.08s -> 10029.41s]  The fake ID comes from you.
[10029.41s -> 10037.10s]  We need a writing utensil for you.
[10037.10s -> 10038.10s]  Is there somebody I didn't meet?
[10038.10s -> 10045.66s]  What did I not meet?
[10045.66s -> 10046.66s]  The saloon?
[10046.66s -> 10048.22s]  Oh shit.
[10048.22s -> 10049.22s]  There is somebody at the saloon.
[10049.22s -> 10063.97s]  Oh, wait.
[10063.97s -> 10064.97s]  Isn't this Bernie?
[10064.97s -> 10065.97s]  This was original Bernie.
[10076.62s -> 10082.94s]  Why are you being captive?
[10082.94s -> 10083.94s]  Be stiff?
[10083.94s -> 10084.94s]  Bad thing?
[10084.94s -> 10085.94s]  Perhaps?
[10085.94s -> 10087.76s]  Or who?
[10087.76s -> 10091.06s]  I'm willing to determine such cruel and bad.
[10091.06s -> 10093.54s]  A stolen hat is a message.
[10093.54s -> 10096.62s]  Do not let yourself be shielded.
[10096.62s -> 10100.06s]  The light of the sun holds more answers than we think.
[10100.06s -> 10105.41s]  Answers to what?
[10105.41s -> 10107.93s]  Questions.
[10107.93s -> 10108.93s]  What questions?
[10108.93s -> 10112.91s]  Why is it so bright out here?
[10112.91s -> 10114.71s]  How do I charge?
[10114.71s -> 10118.47s]  Charge this solar-powered bobblehead and more.
[10118.47s -> 10121.41s]  I'm certain of it.
[10121.41s -> 10126.81s]  We spent so much time focused on how to find the missing hats, and no time considering
[10126.81s -> 10129.45s]  why we had them in the first place.
[10129.45s -> 10130.45s]  Now who?
[10130.45s -> 10136.66s]  I would assume for sun protection.
[10136.66s -> 10138.54s]  Protection from the sun?
[10138.54s -> 10140.94s]  What harm does the sun pose to us?
[10140.94s -> 10146.18s]  The sun can be bad for your skin.
[10146.18s -> 10148.82s]  If I stay in the sun too long, my skin goes all crispy.
[10148.82s -> 10151.80s]  I turn to a crispy fried snack.
[10151.80s -> 10156.50s]  Is being crispy wrong, detective?
[10156.50s -> 10157.50s]  It's wrong for me.
[10158.83s -> 10163.11s]  Who are we to determine wrong and right?
[10163.11s -> 10165.31s]  I'm Frog Detective.
[10165.31s -> 10171.14s]  And I am just a lonely poet, trying to make sense of the world.
[10171.14s -> 10173.62s]  Nice to meet you.
[10173.62s -> 10175.34s]  And you?
[10175.34s -> 10180.12s]  This is like if you put the heavy his head under water.
[10180.12s -> 10183.44s]  You sure think a lot about things, huh?
[10183.44s -> 10184.72s]  I try.
[10184.72s -> 10189.20s]  But I think I get it wrong a lot of the time.
[10189.20s -> 10193.15s]  Who are we to determine wrong and right?
[10193.15s -> 10194.75s]  Ha ha ha ha!
[10194.75s -> 10197.51s]  I can do that better.
[10197.51s -> 10201.26s]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[10201.26s -> 10203.39s]  Ha ha.
[10203.39s -> 10207.69s]  If you don't mind me saying, you don't look too much like a cowboy.
[10207.69s -> 10209.05s]  Oh, no.
[10209.05s -> 10210.97s]  Yes, I am no cowboy.
[10210.97s -> 10212.99s]  I am dusty.
[10212.99s -> 10219.18s]  I am an outlaw slash poet, trying to compose the perfect cowboy poem.
[10219.18s -> 10220.82s]  It's taking forever.
[10220.82s -> 10224.12s]  I am no good at this.
[10224.12s -> 10226.67s]  But you have so much to say.
[10226.67s -> 10228.31s]  Yes, no.
[10228.31s -> 10231.03s]  But when I write it down, it gets so muddled.
[10231.03s -> 10232.23s]  That thing comes out right.
[10232.95s -> 10234.63s]  I'm eating my own throat.
[10236.47s -> 10238.30s]  I just swallowed.
[10238.30s -> 10240.78s]  And I swallowed the throat inside of my throat.
[10240.78s -> 10242.36s]  Hold on.
[10242.36s -> 10242.84s]  Give me a second.
[10245.19s -> 10254.60s]  How talented do you have to be to do that shit?
[10254.60s -> 10257.67s]  I'm sure it sounds great.
[10257.67s -> 10259.00s]  It doesn't.
[10259.00s -> 10262.28s]  I am ashamed to even show anyone.
[10262.28s -> 10263.00s]  You can show me.
[10263.00s -> 10263.72s]  I won't judge.
[10265.51s -> 10265.83s]  Okay.
[10270.86s -> 10273.42s]  A cowboy's life is so much fun.
[10273.42s -> 10276.01s]  Sitting round on your bum.
[10276.01s -> 10277.45s]  Ride a scooter.
[10277.45s -> 10278.89s]  Sing a tune.
[10278.89s -> 10281.53s]  Say a yee-haw in the afternoon.
[10281.53s -> 10283.83s]  The sun is bright.
[10283.83s -> 10288.95s]  The smiles shine brighter when waving at this lonely rider.
[10288.95s -> 10292.31s]  I give a nod and a smile back too.
[10292.31s -> 10296.63s]  Yet I wish I could be someone new.
[10296.63s -> 10299.56s]  An outlaw's life is not for me.
[10300.44s -> 10302.36s]  I want to ride and be carefree.
[10307.14s -> 10311.70s]  Instead, I sit and write stuff down, not fitting in with this cowboy town.
[10311.70s -> 10312.98s]  And I love cookies.
[10316.58s -> 10321.21s]  You're not rolling your R's.
[10332.87s -> 10333.91s]  It's beautiful.
[10333.91s -> 10338.23s]  I would say that's a perfect cowboy poem.
[10338.23s -> 10340.79s]  Thanks, but I think I want to write a new one.
[10342.15s -> 10343.35s]  Chocolate chip cookie.
[10343.91s -> 10347.05s]  Do you mind if I ask you some questions about the case?
[10348.30s -> 10349.26s]  Go ahead.
[10349.26s -> 10357.26s]  Do you need help workshopping a perfect cowboy poem?
[10357.26s -> 10362.41s]  I would love that.
[10363.05s -> 10364.73s]  Nobody here really gets to me.
[10365.37s -> 10366.09s]  You know?
[10366.09s -> 10366.65s]  That was better.
[10367.98s -> 10368.48s]  Totally.
[10369.98s -> 10372.38s]  I'll show you what I have so far.
[10372.38s -> 10374.46s]  And maybe you can help me finish it.
[10376.02s -> 10376.52s]  Sure.
[10380.42s -> 10381.94s]  I saw a cowboy eat a sna-
[10383.22s -> 10384.82s]  Okay, I have to change this.
[10384.82s -> 10386.02s]  I have to change this.
[10386.02s -> 10386.82s]  I have to change.
[10386.82s -> 10389.62s]  Before, like, I lose a hundred thousand followers.
[10390.84s -> 10392.68s]  I saw a cowboy eat a snack.
[10392.68s -> 10393.88s]  A bowl of cereal.
[10393.88s -> 10400.81s]  I saw a cowboy eat a snack, a bowl of cereal near the tracks.
[10400.81s -> 10401.77s]  From his sack.
[10402.41s -> 10403.05s]  Okay.
[10403.05s -> 10406.31s]  From his sack.
[10406.31s -> 10406.81s]  Nice.
[10408.12s -> 10409.96s]  I saw a cowboy eat a snack.
[10409.96s -> 10412.94s]  A bowl of cereal from his sack.
[10412.94s -> 10414.38s]  He finished quickly.
[10414.38s -> 10415.82s]  Smart and sure.
[10415.82s -> 10421.96s]  Then headed off to get some more.
[10421.96s -> 10422.92s]  Towards the store.
[10422.92s -> 10424.04s]  Cause he was bored.
[10424.04s -> 10425.08s]  Towards the store.
[10425.08s -> 10425.56s]  Towards-
[10425.56s -> 10427.18s]  Towards the store.
[10427.18s -> 10428.78s]  Towards the store.
[10428.78s -> 10429.18s]  Wow.
[10429.18s -> 10429.98s]  I'm getting better.
[10429.98s -> 10436.92s]  He finished quickly.
[10436.92s -> 10437.56s]  Smart and sure.
[10437.56s -> 10438.28s]  Then he headed-
[10438.28s -> 10440.76s]  Then he headed off towards the store.
[10440.76s -> 10441.48s]  Sure.
[10441.48s -> 10441.96s]  Store.
[10441.96s -> 10442.52s]  More.
[10442.52s -> 10443.56s]  To get some more.
[10443.56s -> 10448.57s]  To get some more.
[10448.57s -> 10449.93s]  He finished quickly.
[10449.93s -> 10451.21s]  Smart and sure.
[10451.29s -> 10453.61s]  Then headed off to get some more.
[10453.61s -> 10456.70s]  But just ahead, to his shock.
[10456.70s -> 10462.63s]  There stood a newly built office block.
[10462.63s -> 10466.15s]  There was a Nessie from the lock.
[10466.15s -> 10467.99s]  He saw a goblin on a rock.
[10467.99s -> 10476.10s]  He saw a goblin on a rock.
[10479.56s -> 10481.03s]  Okay, sure.
[10481.03s -> 10486.23s]  But just ahead, to his shock, he saw a goblin on a rock.
[10486.23s -> 10497.30s]  He waddled over, concentrated face, only to discover.
[10497.30s -> 10499.86s]  Yeah, I did the voice crack on purpose.
[10499.86s -> 10504.46s]  I'm glad you picked it up.
[10504.46s -> 10506.78s]  He waddled over, concentrated face, only to discover.
[10508.66s -> 10509.96s]  Face.
[10509.96s -> 10510.60s]  Nothing there.
[10510.60s -> 10511.80s]  Just empty space.
[10511.80s -> 10513.93s]  Trace.
[10513.93s -> 10519.56s]  Trace.
[10519.56s -> 10520.84s]  Intentional voice cracks.
[10520.84s -> 10521.88s]  I figured it'd be kind of funny.
[10525.08s -> 10526.76s]  I'm going to say trace.
[10526.76s -> 10527.16s]  Face.
[10527.16s -> 10527.80s]  Trace.
[10527.80s -> 10532.22s]  The thing had gone without a trace.
[10534.23s -> 10535.35s]  Thought twist.
[10535.35s -> 10536.44s]  Okay.
[10536.44s -> 10538.84s]  He waddled over, concentrated face,
[10538.84s -> 10542.44s]  only to discover the thing had gone without a trace.
[10542.44s -> 10545.48s]  The cowboy smiled and shook his head.
[10545.48s -> 10551.42s]  And off he went, feeling like an egghead.
[10551.42s -> 10555.40s]  You can't rhyme head with head.
[10555.40s -> 10558.78s]  Back to bed.
[10558.78s -> 10560.28s]  Back to bed.
[10560.28s -> 10562.36s]  Cowboy smiled and shook his head.
[10562.36s -> 10564.54s]  And off he went, back to bed.
[10564.54s -> 10565.50s]  Aha!
[10565.50s -> 10566.54s]  It's perfect.
[10566.54s -> 10567.66s]  The perfect poem.
[10567.66s -> 10569.66s]  I can't wait to recite it in front of the crowd.
[10570.52s -> 10572.60s]  Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, detective.
[10574.94s -> 10575.90s]  It wasn't a problem at all.
[10575.90s -> 10577.18s]  I had lots of fun.
[10577.18s -> 10578.14s]  I'm becoming like German.
[10578.78s -> 10582.78s]  I feel like I understand the cowboy life a bit better now.
[10582.78s -> 10584.78s]  I'm doing, I'm literally doing Arnold.
[10584.78s -> 10586.79s]  French.
[10586.79s -> 10589.99s]  Maybe one day I will feel confident enough to become one myself.
[10590.55s -> 10592.95s]  I wish you the best of luck.
[10593.59s -> 10594.87s]  Oh, thanks.
[10594.87s -> 10595.99s]  I appreciate it.
[10597.37s -> 10599.45s]  Hey, since I've written the perfect poem,
[10599.45s -> 10603.90s]  I don't need my writing supplies anymore.
[10603.90s -> 10604.70s]  Really?
[10604.70s -> 10606.22s]  You don't want to write any more poems?
[10607.46s -> 10608.34s]  No, no, no, I do.
[10608.34s -> 10611.06s]  But every time I start to do a project,
[10611.06s -> 10613.38s]  I like to use new tools.
[10614.39s -> 10617.43s]  So I don't take the energy out of the old poem, no?
[10617.43s -> 10619.14s]  That sounds expensive.
[10619.94s -> 10620.26s]  Yes.
[10620.82s -> 10627.70s]  Anyway, detective, you suck.
[10627.70s -> 10629.88s]  Stop that.
[10629.88s -> 10630.92s]  Don't stop saying that.
[10630.92s -> 10631.72s]  Stop being that person.
[10631.72s -> 10633.00s]  Time that person or ban that person.
[10633.72s -> 10635.22s]  Stop saying that about me.
[10643.53s -> 10643.85s]  All right.
[10644.79s -> 10645.03s]  All right.
[10645.03s -> 10645.67s]  We got everything.
[10646.95s -> 10647.91s]  You do that voice for too long.
[10647.91s -> 10648.71s]  It becomes your voice.
[10659.32s -> 10661.69s]  Okay.
[10661.69s -> 10662.89s]  Let's go get the ID.
[10663.45s -> 10668.47s]  All right.
[10668.47s -> 10669.03s]  Be honest.
[10669.03s -> 10670.73s]  I really want to know.
[10670.73s -> 10674.09s]  On a scale of zero to 10,
[10674.09s -> 10676.52s]  what would you write that heavy voice?
[10677.72s -> 10679.40s]  It's a very difficult voice to do.
[10679.40s -> 10680.60s]  You have to be incredibly talented.
[10680.60s -> 10682.68s]  What would you actually give me like a real number?
[10682.68s -> 10683.24s]  Like six?
[10683.88s -> 10685.80s]  I think that was a solid six.
[10686.52s -> 10687.48s]  Like a 6.5.
[10688.44s -> 10689.56s]  At least, yeah, six or seven.
[10690.20s -> 10690.92s]  I'll take a six.
[10697.62s -> 10699.70s]  Definitely need to work on the accent portion.
[10699.70s -> 10702.18s]  But I think if I really tried,
[10702.18s -> 10706.26s]  I could really get this part.
[10706.26s -> 10706.74s]  You know what I mean?
[10706.74s -> 10709.22s]  That exact tone.
[10717.91s -> 10718.23s]  All right.
[10718.23s -> 10719.35s]  Writing supplies.
[10719.35s -> 10723.59s]  I have some writing supplies right here.
[10723.59s -> 10725.91s]  How did you get those so quickly?
[10725.91s -> 10728.94s]  I helped you compose a beautiful poem.
[10728.94s -> 10731.78s]  Sounds boring.
[10731.78s -> 10735.13s]  Well, thanks for getting those writing supplies for me.
[10735.13s -> 10736.17s]  I appreciate it.
[10736.25s -> 10739.21s]  If there's anything I can do for you, let me know.
[10739.21s -> 10740.52s]  I have a bunch of skills.
[10741.24s -> 10742.95s]  I wish I had a bunch of skills.
[10743.51s -> 10745.58s]  We can't all be onto dynamite.
[10745.58s -> 10748.23s]  May I ask you some questions?
[10749.56s -> 10750.28s]  Fake ID.
[10751.00s -> 10754.62s]  You mentioned you can forge identification, right?
[10754.62s -> 10756.20s]  I sure can.
[10756.20s -> 10758.30s]  I was wondering if you could help me.
[10759.22s -> 10759.94s]  Sure.
[10759.94s -> 10763.18s]  Anything for my friend, the detective.
[10763.18s -> 10763.58s]  Amazing.
[10763.58s -> 10766.06s]  I need to get a fake ID made for Susie.
[10766.06s -> 10766.54s]  Can you help?
[10769.26s -> 10770.86s]  Do you want to know what it's for?
[10770.86s -> 10774.18s]  I am not interested in other people's business.
[10774.18s -> 10776.74s]  I'll get that ready for you when it's your fee.
[10776.74s -> 10786.89s]  Oh, there goes Chad again.
[10787.61s -> 10789.45s]  Being wicked sus.
[10796.55s -> 10797.51s]  That was hidden dialogue.
[10797.51s -> 10798.07s]  You didn't see that.
[10799.03s -> 10800.23s]  I had a hidden dialogue pop up.
[10800.23s -> 10801.35s]  That's why I said that.
[10801.35s -> 10803.03s]  There's some dialogue option popping up.
[10803.03s -> 10805.88s]  All right, I'm done.
[10805.88s -> 10807.32s]  Anything else I can help you with?
[10807.32s -> 10808.89s]  I think I'm good for now.
[10808.89s -> 10809.45s]  Thanks so much.
[10813.26s -> 10814.14s]  No worries, partner.
[10817.82s -> 10819.05s]  All right.
[10819.05s -> 10822.79s]  Now we bring the fake ID to...
[10828.98s -> 10833.29s]  Goes to the bank where the rabbit is.
[10840.28s -> 10841.64s]  Here is your fake ID.
[10849.54s -> 10851.30s]  Okay, so before I give you this,
[10851.30s -> 10853.70s]  just know that it just makes me very uncomfortable.
[10853.70s -> 10856.12s]  But I know how important it is for me to solve this case
[10856.12s -> 10857.16s]  and impress the lobster cop.
[10858.17s -> 10860.33s]  So here's your fake ID.
[10861.05s -> 10864.12s]  Let's be on to it.
[10864.12s -> 10866.04s]  Yes, this rules.
[10866.04s -> 10867.08s]  It looks so realistic.
[10868.22s -> 10870.14s]  I don't think it looks realistic at all,
[10870.14s -> 10872.50s]  but it should be enough to get you in.
[10872.50s -> 10879.62s]  Okay, I'll be right back.
[10879.62s -> 10880.18s]  It worked.
[10880.18s -> 10880.90s]  Thanks, detective.
[10881.46s -> 10883.70s]  I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about how you helped me.
[10884.79s -> 10886.31s]  Oh, no, that's okay.
[10886.31s -> 10888.55s]  Don't tell anybody.
[10888.55s -> 10889.59s]  Hear ye, hear ye.
[10889.59s -> 10892.33s]  The detective helped me break into a bank.
[10892.33s -> 10893.37s]  No, no, no, no.
[10893.37s -> 10895.80s]  They should call you the burglar.
[10895.80s -> 10898.06s]  I do not want to be called that.
[10898.06s -> 10898.86s]  Fine, fine, fair here.
[10898.86s -> 10901.78s]  I got the map out for you.
[10901.78s -> 10905.22s]  Crime map.
[10905.22s -> 10906.82s]  And I got my real ID out.
[10906.82s -> 10909.34s]  So I won't be breaking the rules anymore.
[10909.34s -> 10910.30s]  Glad to hear it.
[10910.30s -> 10910.94s]  Thanks for the map.
[10910.94s -> 10915.27s]  I think I'll be a big help.
[10915.27s -> 10916.66s]  Oh, wait.
[10916.66s -> 10918.78s]  I think that's everything.
[10918.78s -> 10921.02s]  Crime map, key, stew.
[10921.02s -> 10924.46s]  I think that's it.
[10924.46s -> 10925.22s]  Did I...
[10925.22s -> 10926.90s]  Can I go back to the cop now?
[10926.90s -> 10937.86s]  I think that's it.
[10937.86s -> 10938.74s]  Crime scene map.
[10938.74s -> 10939.54s]  Criminal tool...
[10939.54s -> 10942.36s]  The tool must be the shovel.
[10942.36s -> 10943.40s]  Is this a granny-like?
[10943.40s -> 10945.48s]  No, it is not.
[10945.48s -> 10949.32s]  A granny-like would have all of this stuff be in all these buildings
[10949.32s -> 10951.72s]  and have to do the same exact route.
[10951.72s -> 10954.78s]  But there's a person running 100 miles per hour behind me.
[10954.78s -> 10958.74s]  And if they touch me, the game's over.
[10958.74s -> 10960.18s]  So it's close.
[10960.18s -> 10969.45s]  All right, I have returned.
[10969.45s -> 10970.25s]  Here you go.
[10970.25s -> 10974.66s]  So are you finished?
[10974.66s -> 10975.69s]  Huh?
[10975.69s -> 10978.87s]  Did you find all the things I asked for?
[10978.87s -> 10981.43s]  I think so.
[10981.43s -> 10982.63s]  Ah, great initiative.
[10982.63s -> 10983.51s]  Let's take a look.
[10983.51s -> 10986.36s]  A map of the crime scene.
[10986.36s -> 10988.04s]  That looks like a map of the graveyard.
[10988.04s -> 10991.16s]  Well, that could be it, but we'll have to wait and see.
[10991.24s -> 10994.12s]  A tool capable of aiding criminal activity.
[10994.12s -> 10995.08s]  Oh, a shovel.
[10995.08s -> 10997.72s]  I think you could be right, detective.
[10997.72s -> 11000.84s]  A key that will lead us to a clue.
[11000.84s -> 11002.36s]  That sure looks like a key to me.
[11002.36s -> 11004.31s]  Any idea where it could lead?
[11004.31s -> 11006.86s]  A meal for the number one best detective.
[11006.86s -> 11008.06s]  Oh, thank you very much.
[11008.06s -> 11012.06s]  As a number one best detective, this too is clearly for me.
[11013.62s -> 11014.74s]  Would you look at that?
[11014.74s -> 11016.02s]  The rookie came through.
[11016.02s -> 11018.44s]  Nice work, detective.
[11018.44s -> 11019.48s]  Thank you, lobster cop.
[11020.49s -> 11022.41s]  Now you go ahead and check out the crime scene.
[11022.41s -> 11023.61s]  I'll be right behind.
[11023.61s -> 11026.33s]  I just have some quick business to attend to.
[11026.33s -> 11028.42s]  I can do that.
[11028.42s -> 11031.30s]  I'll take that meal now, though.
[11033.40s -> 11034.28s]  It's all yours.
[11034.28s -> 11035.00s]  Enjoy.
[11035.00s -> 11043.27s]  Otto's Big Adventure 2 voice?
[11043.27s -> 11043.75s]  Yeah.
[11043.75s -> 11051.38s]  He's free.
[11051.38s -> 11054.31s]  I don't.
[11054.31s -> 11054.87s]  Alrighty.
[11055.43s -> 11066.30s]  Well, here goes nothing.
[11066.30s -> 11069.02s]  You're too kind to be streaming just for me on my birthday.
[11071.18s -> 11075.50s]  Well, I didn't want to tell anybody because it was a surprise, but everybody,
[11077.58s -> 11082.22s]  Happy birthday to you.
[11082.22s -> 11082.70s]  There it is.
[11083.78s -> 11085.46s]  Happy birthday.
[11095.90s -> 11096.54s]  Just for you.
[11108.36s -> 11109.64s]  This is where the hats are hidden.
[11109.64s -> 11111.54s]  Are we going to see who did it?
[11111.54s -> 11112.82s]  All right, chat.
[11112.82s -> 11118.44s]  Who do you guys think is the one that buried the hats here?
[11119.16s -> 11124.42s]  Oh, we got a raid.
[11125.29s -> 11126.73s]  Raid, raid, raid, raid.
[11129.90s -> 11132.14s]  Thank you, Vanya Laser.
[11132.22s -> 11134.71s]  I say your name wrong every single fucking time.
[11138.82s -> 11140.74s]  I can't talk properly.
[11140.74s -> 11142.34s]  I cannot talk properly.
[11142.34s -> 11148.07s]  But thanks to the raid.
[11148.07s -> 11148.79s]  Welcome.
[11148.79s -> 11151.54s]  How's everybody doing?
[11151.54s -> 11152.18s]  What were we doing?
[11152.18s -> 11154.10s]  What was going on in your stream?
[11154.10s -> 11156.86s]  Something fun.
[11156.86s -> 11160.31s]  Thanks to the raid, though.
[11160.31s -> 11162.26s]  Happy birthday song?
[11162.26s -> 11171.16s]  Was it your birthday?
[11171.16s -> 11171.56s]  No.
[11171.56s -> 11172.20s]  Oh, okay.
[11173.80s -> 11175.22s]  It's like, oh, shit.
[11175.22s -> 11175.46s]  All right.
[11175.46s -> 11177.64s]  It was your birthday today.
[11177.64s -> 11178.52s]  Oh, appreciate it.
[11178.52s -> 11179.58s]  Thank you.
[11179.58s -> 11180.70s]  We're playing Frog Detective.
[11181.69s -> 11184.54s]  I do want to say this is the final,
[11184.54s -> 11186.38s]  probably two minutes of this game.
[11186.38s -> 11189.50s]  So if you don't want to see a major spoiler for Frog Detective 3,
[11189.50s -> 11191.53s]  go ahead and close your eyes.
[11191.53s -> 11196.02s]  Here it comes.
[11196.02s -> 11196.98s]  Here we go.
[11196.98s -> 11201.38s]  I wish I could figure out the motive of this crime.
[11201.38s -> 11203.40s]  Does this make any sense?
[11203.40s -> 11204.12s]  Oh, well.
[11204.12s -> 11207.90s]  I'll just dig these up and hope Lobster Cop has more information.
[11207.90s -> 11218.01s]  What was that?
[11218.01s -> 11218.73s]  Great.
[11218.73s -> 11219.77s]  I found the hats.
[11219.77s -> 11223.00s]  I'm sure everyone will be so relieved to have them back.
[11223.00s -> 11224.54s]  I'll take them back to town.
[11227.08s -> 11229.02s]  Why am I so gassy today?
[11229.02s -> 11230.98s]  It's insane.
[11230.98s -> 11234.10s]  It sure is nice to have a simple resolution to this mystery.
[11234.10s -> 11243.88s]  There are the hats.
[11243.88s -> 11246.65s]  Okay.
[11246.65s -> 11247.69s]  What happened?
[11247.69s -> 11249.90s]  Who did it?
[11249.90s -> 11252.34s]  Uh-oh.
[11252.34s -> 11252.82s]  Drama.
[11260.78s -> 11261.83s]  Oh, dear.
[11261.83s -> 11264.42s]  Good luck trying to remember what everybody sounded like.
[11264.42s -> 11266.63s]  Here comes the detective now.
[11266.63s -> 11268.87s]  Just in time for the town meeting to begin.
[11268.87s -> 11276.95s]  The first order of business is poem.
[11276.95s -> 11284.31s]  Please read poem.
[11284.31s -> 11285.27s]  Hello.
[11285.27s -> 11287.75s]  I would like to read you my poem.
[11287.75s -> 11292.23s]  This is my first time performing a poem and I am nervous.
[11292.23s -> 11293.67s]  Please do not laugh.
[11299.18s -> 11301.02s]  I saw a cowboy eat a snack.
[11301.50s -> 11306.78s]  A bowl of cereal from his sack.
[11306.78s -> 11315.02s]  He finished quickly, smart and sure, then headed off to get some more.
[11315.02s -> 11320.31s]  But just ahead, to his shock, he saw a goblin on a rock.
[11320.31s -> 11334.20s]  He wandered over, concentrated face, only to discover the thing had gone without a trace.
[11334.20s -> 11339.48s]  The cowboy smiled and shook his head and off he went back to bed.
[11339.48s -> 11351.61s]  Great.
[11351.61s -> 11361.69s]  Thank you for the poem.
[11361.69s -> 11363.21s]  Next order of business.
[11363.21s -> 11363.93s]  Crime solved.
[11365.19s -> 11368.02s]  I am pleased to announce I have recovered.
[11368.02s -> 11370.68s]  Ah, let me stop you right there, detective.
[11372.98s -> 11377.38s]  I am pleased to announce I have found the culprit in the case of the missing hats.
[11380.36s -> 11385.80s]  I worked hard to cover this conclusion, so I trust I will have your full attention as
[11385.80s -> 11388.23s]  I go through the facts.
[11388.23s -> 11390.60s]  Please pay attention.
[11390.60s -> 11396.33s]  Earlier today, I had the pleasure of appointing Mason Mole as the title of sheriff.
[11396.33s -> 11398.39s]  Everybody likes this.
[11398.39s -> 11402.34s]  Yes, this is a universally loved decision.
[11402.34s -> 11405.34s]  Shortly after, the detective arrived.
[11405.34s -> 11406.22s]  That's me.
[11406.22s -> 11410.12s]  Quiet, please, detective.
[11410.12s -> 11417.66s]  Soon as the detective arrived, I'm sure you all noticed your hats went missing.
[11417.66s -> 11422.31s]  Wait, it is with great sadness that I have to tell you this.
[11422.31s -> 11428.76s]  The culprit of this crime, the hat-stealing monster of Cowboy County,
[11428.76s -> 11434.17s]  is none other than that second-best investigator, Frog the Detective.
[11434.17s -> 11437.88s]  Wait, what?
[11437.88s -> 11442.36s]  I've been presented a piece of evidence by our very own Mason Mole
[11442.36s -> 11444.68s]  that ties the detective to the crime.
[11444.68s -> 11446.07s]  What evidence?
[11447.13s -> 11447.93s]  This.
[11447.93s -> 11450.47s]  No, this is a mistake.
[11450.47s -> 11452.15s]  I was digging up the hats because I found it.
[11452.15s -> 11453.27s]  I found the hats.
[11453.27s -> 11456.84s]  And why do you look so mischievous?
[11456.84s -> 11457.24s]  I don't.
[11457.24s -> 11459.00s]  Someone draw eyebrows on me.
[11459.00s -> 11460.18s]  I didn't have eyebrows.
[11460.18s -> 11461.30s]  I don't have them.
[11461.30s -> 11464.79s]  You have to admit, detective, you have a big motive.
[11464.79s -> 11465.93s]  A motive?
[11465.93s -> 11466.97s]  What happened?
[11466.97s -> 11472.02s]  You've come into a town that prides itself on hats.
[11472.02s -> 11475.38s]  Well-known fact that you cannot wear hats.
[11475.38s -> 11477.38s]  Weird head shape.
[11477.38s -> 11480.23s]  Yes, thank you, Sheriff Mason Mole.
[11480.23s -> 11483.54s]  Because of your weird head shape.
[11483.54s -> 11487.46s]  But I don't mind if other people wear hats.
[11487.46s -> 11490.30s]  Seems to me that you do, detective.
[11490.30s -> 11492.38s]  Why else would you steal the hats and hide them
[11492.38s -> 11494.30s]  where nobody would ever find them?
[11494.30s -> 11496.73s]  But I didn't, I swear.
[11497.80s -> 11499.24s]  Tell it to the judge.
[11499.24s -> 11500.58s]  What judge?
[11504.15s -> 11506.06s]  That's a good point.
[11506.06s -> 11509.74s]  We haven't seen a crime like this in our society before.
[11509.74s -> 11513.64s]  We'll have to invent a punishment.
[11513.64s -> 11515.35s]  I have an idea.
[11515.35s -> 11516.94s]  What is it?
[11516.94s -> 11517.66s]  Bad room.
[11518.78s -> 11519.50s]  What?
[11520.20s -> 11524.34s]  That's less of an idea and more of an ominous concept.
[11524.34s -> 11525.62s]  I will elaborate.
[11525.62s -> 11527.62s]  We put Frog Detective in the bad room.
[11527.62s -> 11530.42s]  A punishment of crime.
[11530.42s -> 11533.24s]  No.
[11533.24s -> 11536.76s]  An excellent if shocking idea, Sheriff Mason Mole.
[11536.76s -> 11540.54s]  We will construct the bad room at once.
[11540.54s -> 11541.66s]  I already made it.
[11541.66s -> 11544.52s]  It's in my office.
[11544.52s -> 11546.28s]  Oh, well, in that case.
[11546.28s -> 11552.82s]  Detective, I sentence you to one year of living in the bad room.
[11552.82s -> 11557.51s]  This is the worst day of my life.
[11557.51s -> 11566.06s]  No, somebody help.
[11566.06s -> 11566.56s]  Revenge.
[11575.93s -> 11576.89s]  How could they?
[11576.89s -> 11592.31s]  How could they?
[11592.31s -> 11593.03s]  What?
[11593.03s -> 11595.10s]  Is that actually a bad end?
[11599.46s -> 11600.34s]  Wait, what?
[11602.55s -> 11603.67s]  That's such a...
[11603.67s -> 11604.95s]  That's so sad.
[11604.95s -> 11606.15s]  That's a bad ending, right?
[11606.15s -> 11607.27s]  That's the worst ending.
[11607.27s -> 11613.80s]  You just get arrested and framed for a crime and they just lock you up.
[11615.88s -> 11616.76s]  Yeah, that's a bad ending.
[11621.29s -> 11621.79s]  Oh, no.
[11622.97s -> 11625.75s]  That might not be the end.
[11627.03s -> 11635.27s]  You need to go fix it.
[11638.92s -> 11639.42s]  Oh, wait.
[11640.04s -> 11642.55s]  Is this a setup for Frog Detective 4?
[11644.63s -> 11646.50s]  This is a series, right?
[11652.44s -> 11653.24s]  You need to fix this.
[11659.22s -> 11660.76s]  What did I do out of?
[11660.76s -> 11661.80s]  Did I do something out of order?
[11662.44s -> 11672.30s]  Yeah, this is episode three.
[11673.02s -> 11677.74s]  What?
[11677.74s -> 11680.14s]  We don't have anyone else to credit and there's still time left.
[11680.14s -> 11684.94s]  The following credits are from Degrassi, the next generation, season six, episode 11.
[11689.74s -> 11690.24s]  Huh?
[11702.54s -> 11703.10s]  Okay.
[11703.10s -> 11706.62s]  Well, this is a job on that on that show.
[11707.98s -> 11710.41s]  This is a pretty good bit.
[11710.41s -> 11710.91s]  Yeah, it is.
[11711.77s -> 11712.41s]  That's a good bit.
[11716.31s -> 11717.35s]  He is so sad in there.
[11717.35s -> 11717.91s]  That's not fair.
[11719.27s -> 11726.31s]  I think it's because you uninstalled the first two games.
[11734.01s -> 11734.65s]  Really?
[11734.65s -> 11737.43s]  Well, let's see.
[11745.30s -> 11746.10s]  Fake fan.
[11746.10s -> 11746.74s]  Fake fan.
[11747.54s -> 11748.71s]  All right, let's see.
[11748.71s -> 11749.21s]  Hold on a second.
[11749.91s -> 11751.88s]  What happens now?
[11759.88s -> 11788.47s]  Are we going to reach out to somebody?
[11813.24s -> 11826.90s]  Oh, frogdetective.net slash blog dot html to my loyal frog blog readers.
[11826.90s -> 11831.05s]  It's our number one of my time in the bad room.
[11831.05s -> 11834.66s]  I know that I am innocent.
[11834.66s -> 11838.26s]  Unfortunately, because the number one best detective put me in here,
[11838.90s -> 11842.01s]  nobody will believe me.
[11842.01s -> 11844.33s]  That's what you get being second best.
[11844.33s -> 11852.98s]  I'm not sure anybody reads my frog blog anymore because of my alleged crimes.
[11852.98s -> 11855.13s]  But if you are reading, thank you.
[11855.70s -> 11859.78s]  I hope to prove my innocence in the case of the hat theft
[11859.78s -> 11863.46s]  and return to being as good of a detective as I can be.
[11863.46s -> 11869.18s]  I'm not sure why Sheriff Mason Mole has framed me,
[11869.18s -> 11873.62s]  but my hope is that it's all just one big misunderstanding,
[11873.62s -> 11879.11s]  as is the case with most of the mysteries I am involved in.
[11879.11s -> 11885.08s]  It would really hurt my feelings to know that he did this on purpose.
[11885.08s -> 11888.79s]  What the fuck is with my gassy body?
[11888.87s -> 11892.71s]  I'm grateful that Loftacop has given me access to a computer
[11892.71s -> 11896.98s]  so I can continue to write my blog post.
[11896.98s -> 11904.73s]  Though I must say, I'm not sure I have much to write about here.
[11904.73s -> 11907.02s]  Thank you for reading.
[11907.02s -> 11909.19s]  Frog Detective X.
[11909.19s -> 11922.41s]  Oh, somebody's going to read the blog and go get them.
[11922.41s -> 11923.93s]  This is terrible.
[11924.82s -> 11926.26s]  I can't believe this.
[11928.63s -> 11929.51s]  What's going on?
[11930.15s -> 11932.47s]  I'm reading the latest frog blog post.
[11932.47s -> 11936.07s]  I was excited to see how I was addicted to solving the mystery in Cowboy County,
[11936.07s -> 11937.27s]  but I can't believe it.
[11937.27s -> 11939.27s]  The detective has been framed for a crime.
[11941.14s -> 11942.02s]  Crime is real?
[11942.82s -> 11944.58s]  Let's not jump to any conclusions here.
[11946.68s -> 11947.72s]  Of course, sorry.
[11948.54s -> 11949.66s]  What do we do, Moe?
[11951.32s -> 11954.14s]  Um, we get back to our science work?
[11955.02s -> 11958.78s]  I can't possibly concentrate on scientific discoveries in these conditions.
[11959.66s -> 11961.74s]  Moe, I have to help the detective.
[11963.48s -> 11970.63s]  How are you going to do that?
[11970.63s -> 11999.56s]  I'll have to solve the mystery myself.
[11999.56s -> 12002.94s]  But now it's not Frog Detective anymore.
[12002.94s -> 12003.18s]  It's...
[12003.82s -> 12014.60s]  Look out, little Moe.
[12014.60s -> 12017.64s]  I'm not coming back until I've proven the detective innocent.
[12020.46s -> 12022.38s]  Wow, Mystery Monkey is so cool.
[12027.98s -> 12034.58s]  Well, it's not over.
[12034.58s -> 12036.95s]  There's still some more.
[12036.95s -> 12038.07s]  New protagonist.
[12038.07s -> 12043.99s]  Can I help you?
[12043.99s -> 12045.99s]  Hi, Supervisor.
[12045.99s -> 12047.83s]  My name is Mystery Monkey.
[12047.83s -> 12052.87s]  We talked on the phone a while back about the mystery of the haunted island.
[12052.87s -> 12056.09s]  Of course, but how could I forget?
[12056.09s -> 12057.88s]  It's good to see you.
[12057.88s -> 12060.39s]  Likewise.
[12060.39s -> 12066.39s]  I realize this is highly unusual, but I'm here about one of your detectives.
[12066.39s -> 12070.71s]  Uh, is it Lobster Cop?
[12071.51s -> 12071.83s]  No.
[12074.70s -> 12075.74s]  Investigator Eel?
[12076.55s -> 12076.79s]  No.
[12077.35s -> 12082.02s]  Inspector Iguana, the incredible Sandy Moth P.I.?
[12082.02s -> 12083.78s]  No, it's none of those.
[12087.69s -> 12092.06s]  Uh, I'm here about Frog Detective.
[12095.10s -> 12097.58s]  Oh, of course, our second best detective.
[12097.58s -> 12101.64s]  Well, the detective isn't around right now.
[12101.64s -> 12106.60s]  Sent my two top investigators to help cover in Cowboy County.
[12106.60s -> 12107.88s]  You haven't heard.
[12107.88s -> 12109.78s]  Heard what?
[12110.90s -> 12115.62s]  The detective has been framed for a crime over in Cowboy County.
[12118.02s -> 12118.90s]  Terrible news.
[12118.90s -> 12121.51s]  How can you be so sure it's a setup?
[12121.51s -> 12123.67s]  The story doesn't add up.
[12123.67s -> 12133.13s]  And I know Frog Detective would never do something so horrible as steal the town's hats.
[12133.13s -> 12135.26s]  Well, there is a clear motive there.
[12135.26s -> 12138.86s]  I know, I know, but it's so out of character.
[12138.86s -> 12142.78s]  Even if the detective is guilty, the punishment is really harsh.
[12142.78s -> 12146.36s]  The detective has been sent to the bad room.
[12146.36s -> 12150.33s]  Oh, no.
[12150.33s -> 12152.54s]  What's the bad room?
[12152.54s -> 12156.34s]  It's something that Sheriff Mason Mole invented.
[12156.34s -> 12157.38s]  Mason Mole?
[12157.38s -> 12159.32s]  That name sounds familiar.
[12159.32s -> 12159.96s]  Oh?
[12159.96s -> 12165.59s]  I've seen him around before, just sort of loitering around the offices.
[12165.59s -> 12168.06s]  Loitering, you say?
[12168.06s -> 12174.30s]  I remember a kind of shady guy hanging around on Martins Island back when we were there
[12174.38s -> 12181.24s]  to investigate the ghost noises, mixing up a lot of different things at the same time.
[12181.24s -> 12184.82s]  But I'm still trying my hardest, Arthur.
[12184.82s -> 12189.30s]  He arrived shortly before the detective, but I didn't get a chance to catch his name.
[12189.30s -> 12192.12s]  He didn't even say hello.
[12192.12s -> 12197.32s]  When I saw his photo on the Frog blog, I knew he ran away something was amiss.
[12197.32s -> 12201.66s]  Great detective skills, Mystery Monkey.
[12201.66s -> 12207.11s]  I know it's a big ask, but do you mind if I snoop around in Frog Detective's office
[12207.11s -> 12208.39s]  to look for clues?
[12208.39s -> 12210.55s]  Be my guest.
[12212.70s -> 12217.62s]  Okay, somebody said who said Kenneth Copeland?
[12227.37s -> 12228.41s]  Okay, let's go.
[12228.41s -> 12238.78s]  I shouldn't snoop in Lobster Cop's office unless I really have to.
[12238.78s -> 12244.46s]  What's in here?
[12244.46s -> 12250.10s]  Clue detecting powder.
[12250.10s -> 12251.13s]  How convenient.
[12251.13s -> 12258.95s]  I'll just spread this powder around and take another look.
[12258.95s -> 12260.15s]  It was your mod?
[12260.15s -> 12274.55s]  Oh, it went by too fast.
[12274.55s -> 12278.31s]  My god, what's that?
[12279.35s -> 12286.71s]  That's a clue.
[12286.71s -> 12306.58s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[12308.28s -> 12308.84s]  Wait a minute.
[12318.89s -> 12319.45s]  Wait a minute.
[12325.18s -> 12327.38s]  Wait a second.
[12327.38s -> 12328.26s]  Wait a second.
[12328.26s -> 12331.64s]  Oh, I couldn't be.
[12331.64s -> 12342.42s]  People walk in here all the time?
[12342.42s -> 12350.52s]  Yeah, that's true.
[12350.52s -> 12351.32s]  Uh oh.
[12351.32s -> 12357.62s]  The Lobster Cop be hiding.
[12357.62s -> 12358.82s]  What are you doing?
[12358.82s -> 12360.66s]  Why did he do that?
[12366.15s -> 12368.39s]  Copy of the detective's notebook.
[12372.22s -> 12375.18s]  Lobster Cop and Mason Mole.
[12379.08s -> 12384.65s]  Note, it reads, hello Lobster Cop.
[12384.65s -> 12386.97s]  It's me, your bestie forever, Mason Mole.
[12387.61s -> 12388.81s]  I've done what you asked.
[12390.28s -> 12394.04s]  Not easy to trail the detective unnoticed, but I think I did a great job.
[12394.92s -> 12398.84s]  I fear that your suspicions are correct and that frog detective is on the right track
[12398.84s -> 12401.72s]  to overtaking your position as number one best detective.
[12401.72s -> 12406.28s]  You can keep pretending to solve mysteries instead of actually solving them.
[12406.28s -> 12408.68s]  The supervisor will eventually notice.
[12408.68s -> 12412.73s]  So I've taken the detective's notebook inside.
[12412.73s -> 12415.85s]  There's some great insights on how the detective works through a case.
[12416.57s -> 12420.52s]  Maybe you can read and learn, but it may not be enough.
[12421.62s -> 12426.18s]  As the detective gets better and better, your position as number one is threatened.
[12426.18s -> 12430.10s]  It's time to enact the plan.
[12431.30s -> 12435.86s]  Came up with, it's devious and mean and not very nice.
[12436.58s -> 12441.78s]  But if you want to be the best, you'll have to get rid of the best.
[12441.78s -> 12450.65s]  This can't be true.
[12451.59s -> 12454.23s]  Lobster Cop, number one best detective, a fraud?
[12454.79s -> 12465.10s]  I mean, to get the supervisor and head to Cowboy County, there's been a terrible misjustice.
[12465.10s -> 12465.98s]  Let's go.
[12465.98s -> 12466.86s]  Let's go.
[12466.86s -> 12467.58s]  Let's go.
[12467.58s -> 12480.80s]  Okay.
[12482.09s -> 12483.21s]  Where, where are you?
[12484.25s -> 12484.75s]  I'm coming.
[12492.12s -> 12499.24s]  What's up?
[12499.24s -> 12502.70s]  Howdy, folks.
[12502.70s -> 12506.79s]  What brings you to Cowboy County so late?
[12506.79s -> 12509.19s]  This is our turf.
[12509.19s -> 12511.21s]  You better have good food.
[12511.21s -> 12512.57s]  We don't want any trouble.
[12513.21s -> 12515.74s]  We're here about our good friend, the frog detective.
[12517.62s -> 12518.82s]  The duality of frog.
[12519.38s -> 12521.70s]  How can one be so kind, poetic, and thoughtful?
[12522.58s -> 12525.38s]  Also, be a stealer of our hats.
[12525.38s -> 12530.95s]  I forgot who, what do you sound like?
[12531.03s -> 12534.47s]  Frog's so pretty, so alluring, and yet.
[12534.47s -> 12535.83s]  What does this person sound like?
[12535.83s -> 12540.49s]  You really, I really trusted frog detective.
[12540.49s -> 12541.05s]  That snake.
[12541.69s -> 12544.73s]  I can't go on a date with a criminal.
[12544.73s -> 12545.53s]  That's just not me.
[12546.84s -> 12549.40s]  I, aren't you a bandit?
[12550.04s -> 12552.44s]  I'm outlawed.
[12552.44s -> 12554.60s]  So you live outside the law.
[12556.25s -> 12558.97s]  Well, when there's no laws, it makes it pretty easy.
[12560.36s -> 12562.36s]  It doesn't matter anyway.
[12562.36s -> 12565.24s]  Frog detective is innocent.
[12565.24s -> 12567.30s]  Sure.
[12567.30s -> 12570.22s]  We all saw the photo.
[12570.22s -> 12572.22s]  Those furrowed brows tell the whole story.
[12573.35s -> 12576.95s]  Frog detective doesn't even have eyebrows.
[12580.04s -> 12581.16s]  So those were stolen too.
[12582.94s -> 12584.14s]  Oh, you're mistaken.
[12584.14s -> 12587.69s]  Mystery Monkey found all the evidence.
[12587.69s -> 12588.65s]  Who's mystery monkey?
[12589.59s -> 12590.39s]  That's me.
[12590.39s -> 12595.03s]  You may have read my comments before on frog detective's frog blog.
[12595.03s -> 12596.79s]  I'm a pretty active user.
[12598.86s -> 12599.82s]  Blogs are still a thing?
[12601.48s -> 12603.48s]  Regardless, you say it was a mistake.
[12604.60s -> 12606.12s]  Not so much a mistake.
[12606.76s -> 12614.12s]  A sit up, a sit up, a sit up, a sit up, a sit up, a sit up.
[12614.12s -> 12615.61s]  Better?
[12615.61s -> 12622.97s]  I have reason to believe Sheriff Mason Mole and lobster cop coordinated the takedown
[12622.97s -> 12624.81s]  of our beloved frog detective.
[12629.26s -> 12630.14s]  That's so messed up.
[12631.62s -> 12633.46s]  Who would do that to such a beautiful frog?
[12634.82s -> 12637.06s]  Someone very jealous, I'm afraid.
[12637.78s -> 12639.51s]  How can we help?
[12640.58s -> 12644.50s]  If you can point us in the direction of where frog detective is being held,
[12645.46s -> 12646.34s]  that would help a lot.
[12649.02s -> 12649.74s]  Easy.
[12649.74s -> 12652.54s]  Sheriff Mason Mole has the detective locked up in bad room.
[12661.69s -> 12662.49s]  I just didn't want to...
[12662.49s -> 12665.91s]  I burped off camera.
[12665.91s -> 12666.79s]  You're quiet.
[12666.79s -> 12668.49s]  You should be able to sneak in without trouble.
[12669.61s -> 12671.13s]  Thanks for your help bandits.
[12672.26s -> 12675.94s]  I am now going to change the voice of this character
[12676.66s -> 12679.86s]  because it's kind of hard to do after so long.
[12680.58s -> 12683.70s]  They will now sound better and different than this.
[12684.66s -> 12688.34s]  Okay Arthur, I'm changing it to something else.
[12691.08s -> 12691.64s]  My bad.
[12692.20s -> 12700.52s]  He's decomposing.
[12702.20s -> 12711.48s]  Can I sneak in?
[12711.48s -> 12713.56s]  I said to sneak in, right?
[12713.56s -> 12725.03s]  Mystery Monkey?
[12725.59s -> 12726.23s]  Supervisor?
[12726.79s -> 12727.83s]  What are you doing here?
[12728.55s -> 12731.27s]  I didn't know I was allowed visitors in bad room.
[12731.27s -> 12732.71s]  I didn't anyone would want to visit me.
[12733.43s -> 12738.87s]  We're here to...
[12738.87s -> 12739.51s]  That's even worse.
[12739.51s -> 12740.55s]  No, we're here.
[12741.53s -> 12743.45s]  We're here to bust you out.
[12745.46s -> 12746.02s]  What?
[12746.02s -> 12748.74s]  Mystery Monkey has proof you were framed.
[12749.46s -> 12750.02s]  I knew it.
[12750.02s -> 12751.38s]  Sheriff Mason Mole was up to something.
[12751.94s -> 12754.25s]  Not just him detective.
[12754.89s -> 12756.57s]  I'm sorry to tell you I believe
[12757.45s -> 12761.74s]  Lobster Cop and Mason Mole planned this all along.
[12764.54s -> 12765.10s]  It can't be.
[12766.06s -> 12767.90s]  Lobster Cop is number one best detective.
[12767.90s -> 12769.10s]  Why would he try to frame me?
[12770.44s -> 12772.28s]  Hard to know for sure until we ask.
[12772.28s -> 12775.64s]  But it looks like Lobster Cop has been dealing with a bad case of jealousy.
[12777.14s -> 12779.78s]  Green with envy one might say.
[12783.54s -> 12784.50s]  Envious of who?
[12788.33s -> 12789.77s]  You detective.
[12790.41s -> 12791.85s]  They're talking about you.
[12792.57s -> 12794.46s]  It's not possible.
[12795.02s -> 12797.80s]  It's time to shift your understanding of the world detective.
[12798.36s -> 12801.48s]  Not everyone is out to do a good job and solve mysteries like you.
[12803.26s -> 12804.54s]  I simply can't believe it.
[12805.74s -> 12806.38s]  Well, let's...
[12807.18s -> 12811.18s]  I keep hitting the microphone and I'm sorry that I do that.
[12811.18s -> 12811.82s]  But we...
[12811.82s -> 12815.42s]  Let's wait until dawn and confront Lobster Cop and Mason Mole.
[12816.36s -> 12817.48s]  Once and for all.
[12818.12s -> 12820.73s]  The sun is coming up as we speak.
[12820.73s -> 12821.69s]  I'll call a town meeting.
[12829.70s -> 12833.42s]  Jeremy, you're turning into voice soup.
[12833.42s -> 12834.46s]  Uh oh, here we go.
[12834.46s -> 12839.40s]  What is the meaning of this?
[12840.60s -> 12842.28s]  Only I get to call town meetings.
[12843.35s -> 12847.43s]  I have called this town meeting for a very important purpose.
[12848.23s -> 12851.27s]  I have some news about the hat stealing case.
[12852.78s -> 12854.46s]  But it's closed.
[12854.46s -> 12855.26s]  I solved it.
[12856.30s -> 12857.66s]  Is that so Lobster Cop?
[12859.16s -> 12861.56s]  Supervisor, what are you doing here?
[12861.56s -> 12864.25s]  Please give your attention to Mystery Monkey for just a moment.
[12865.32s -> 12867.00s]  Thank you, Supervisor.
[12867.56s -> 12870.76s]  Yank you town for meeting us on such short notice.
[12871.48s -> 12875.32s]  Sheriff Mason Mole, I have an important question to ask you.
[12877.21s -> 12877.85s]  What?
[12877.85s -> 12883.51s]  How long have you and Lobster Cop been scheming to bring down Frog Detective?
[12885.96s -> 12886.60s]  Huh?
[12886.60s -> 12886.92s]  What?
[12888.76s -> 12889.94s]  This is ridiculous.
[12890.82s -> 12894.66s]  Lobster Cop, I found the secret drawer in your office.
[12896.68s -> 12898.44s]  You can't just go through my office.
[12898.44s -> 12899.08s]  That's a crime.
[12900.02s -> 12902.74s]  Please stop trying to invent crimes.
[12902.74s -> 12904.26s]  Crime is not real.
[12905.45s -> 12909.29s]  As I was saying, I found your secret drawer.
[12909.29s -> 12912.25s]  I found the letter that Mason Mole wrote to you.
[12913.96s -> 12916.36s]  I knew I shouldn't have detailed my schemes on paper.
[12918.17s -> 12922.17s]  Sheriff Mason Mole has been tailing the detective since I called for help
[12922.17s -> 12925.53s]  with the mystery of the haunted island, Arthur.
[12926.55s -> 12931.67s]  As the lead scientist on the island at the time, I can confirm I had several reports
[12931.75s -> 12937.02s]  sightings of Mason Mole sneaking around like a slippery snake.
[12937.02s -> 12938.62s]  Wait, why didn't you tell me?
[12938.62s -> 12942.44s]  There's like someone sneaking around the island is kind of relevant to that case.
[12944.17s -> 12946.41s]  I was too starstruck.
[12947.21s -> 12952.25s]  In any case, I contacted my friend Carlos who runs the shop over in Warlock Woods.
[12952.81s -> 12956.73s]  He also confirmed a sighting of Mason Mole hiding behind his shop.
[12961.90s -> 12962.94s]  Oh, but you did.
[12964.06s -> 12967.82s]  Sheriff Mason Mole, I have reason to believe you were hired by Lobster Cop
[12967.82s -> 12968.86s]  to follow the detective.
[12972.07s -> 12984.63s]  No, I, no, that's not, I, I, this is all a mistake.
[12985.53s -> 12992.97s]  No, Mason Mole, time for us to come clean.
[12992.97s -> 13000.02s]  Frog Detective, ever since you moved in next door to my office, I felt threatened.
[13000.02s -> 13002.52s]  So methodical in your case solving.
[13002.52s -> 13005.80s]  I would read your blogs and go green with envy.
[13005.80s -> 13010.97s]  I've been number one best detective for so long that I grew complacent.
[13012.34s -> 13014.66s]  Every time the supervisor had a mystery to solve,
[13014.66s -> 13018.70s]  I began to believe I wouldn't be able to do it.
[13018.70s -> 13019.90s]  Passed it on to you.
[13019.90s -> 13026.70s]  I just began to pretend to solve mysteries, hoping the supervisor wouldn't notice.
[13026.70s -> 13031.94s]  I was embarrassed at myself and angry at you.
[13031.94s -> 13035.94s]  Angry, but Lobster Cop, your investigative abilities far outweigh mine.
[13035.94s -> 13043.27s]  Maybe they used to, but I became so focused on my own shortcomings that my work suffered.
[13043.27s -> 13045.03s]  Mason Mole is there for me.
[13045.03s -> 13048.95s]  Having friends is so important, but we're a bad influence on each other.
[13050.36s -> 13054.76s]  I needed work, and so I suggested to Lobster Cop that I help take you down,
[13054.76s -> 13055.88s]  and I had the perfect plan.
[13055.88s -> 13057.88s]  I'm very subtle, you see.
[13057.88s -> 13062.54s]  I'm ashamed that it got to that point.
[13062.54s -> 13068.97s]  Instead of asking you for help or swallowing my pride, I let my jealousy get the best of me.
[13068.97s -> 13071.88s]  How did you frame the detective?
[13071.88s -> 13073.32s]  It was a joint effort.
[13073.32s -> 13077.64s]  When I arrived in town, I sneakily stole all the hats and quickly buried them in the graveyard.
[13077.64s -> 13081.75s]  I wrote a map to where they were buried for the detective to find.
[13081.75s -> 13084.30s]  But I didn't find the map.
[13084.30s -> 13086.04s]  Susie did.
[13086.04s -> 13087.72s]  I didn't execute it very well, I admit.
[13088.12s -> 13092.89s]  Once you had the resources to dig up the hats and Lobster Cop had a clear alibi,
[13092.89s -> 13094.73s]  I waited in place to take your photo.
[13095.94s -> 13098.50s]  Wait, what was Lobster Cop's alibi?
[13098.50s -> 13102.12s]  He was eating a delicious meal.
[13102.12s -> 13102.84s]  Of course.
[13102.84s -> 13109.08s]  I'm ashamed to say that I also drew evil eyebrows on the photo of you.
[13109.08s -> 13114.39s]  But what I don't understand is why you put me in a bad room.
[13114.39s -> 13117.27s]  Framing me was bad, but you made a whole room for me to be trapped.
[13117.27s -> 13118.39s]  That's so cruel.
[13118.39s -> 13121.02s]  I'm inclined to agree.
[13121.02s -> 13123.99s]  Putting somebody into a room, whether they did a naughty thing or not,
[13123.99s -> 13125.43s]  seems really harsh and unfair.
[13125.43s -> 13129.77s]  How is someone supposed to grow from their mistakes if they're just sitting around trapped?
[13129.77s -> 13131.56s]  I really don't like that room.
[13131.56s -> 13133.77s]  I hate that room.
[13133.77s -> 13136.78s]  Bad room was my idea, I'm sorry.
[13136.78s -> 13138.54s]  It's a terrible idea.
[13138.54s -> 13140.97s]  I realize it's now my bad.
[13140.97s -> 13149.06s]  Lobster Cop, Mason Mole, you've done something very serious and mean, similar to a crime.
[13149.06s -> 13153.82s]  Our society doesn't have strategies in place to deal with things like this.
[13153.82s -> 13155.82s]  Are you going to send us to the bad room?
[13155.82s -> 13158.22s]  I absolutely not.
[13158.22s -> 13159.51s]  It's messed up.
[13159.51s -> 13163.38s]  But I think there needs to be consequences.
[13163.38s -> 13167.91s]  Lobster Cop, you've abused your power in ways that I cannot begin to comprehend.
[13167.91s -> 13172.36s]  Mason Mole, you enabled and encouraged this behavior.
[13172.36s -> 13173.64s]  I'm mad at you both.
[13173.64s -> 13175.96s]  Deserve that.
[13175.96s -> 13180.38s]  I think an appropriate course of action is to remove Lobster Cop from the detective agency.
[13180.38s -> 13184.49s]  I think you should change career paths for your own good.
[13184.49s -> 13185.05s]  Boil him.
[13189.13s -> 13192.01s]  And boil him is what you're saying over here.
[13192.01s -> 13194.78s]  Maybe do something that helps contribute to society.
[13194.78s -> 13197.03s]  Hop no longer.
[13197.03s -> 13204.55s]  I'll hand in my badge and my gun.
[13204.55s -> 13205.27s]  Gun?
[13205.27s -> 13207.29s]  Wait, why do you have a gun?
[13207.29s -> 13209.58s]  I didn't even know they were real.
[13209.58s -> 13211.53s]  That's really messed up.
[13211.53s -> 13215.59s]  Not like I ever used it.
[13215.59s -> 13219.85s]  Mate, I gave Lobster Cop the gun.
[13219.85s -> 13222.49s]  OK, well, yes, please hand that in.
[13222.49s -> 13228.66s]  Have an idea of what you could do as job, Lobster Cop.
[13228.66s -> 13229.22s]  Oh?
[13229.22s -> 13232.60s]  Why don't you talk to Barney about joining the Post Office?
[13232.60s -> 13237.08s]  Lobster, Posty has a nice ring to it.
[13237.08s -> 13240.02s]  Can I join too?
[13240.02s -> 13241.46s]  I don't see why not.
[13241.46s -> 13244.02s]  Well, then it's settled.
[13244.02s -> 13250.74s]  Lobster, Posty, Posty Mason Mole, do you have anything to say to the detective?
[13250.74s -> 13251.30s]  Yes.
[13251.30s -> 13254.65s]  I'm sincerely sorry for what I did to you, detective.
[13254.65s -> 13258.01s]  You isn't mean, rude, evil, and not nice.
[13258.01s -> 13265.16s]  I don't expect you to forgive me, but time I can prove myself as a great posty.
[13265.16s -> 13265.40s]  Right?
[13265.40s -> 13266.52s]  Some of the wrongs I've done.
[13266.52s -> 13274.06s]  Detective, I acted poorly and encouraged behavior that I shouldn't have.
[13274.06s -> 13277.48s]  I'm going to channel that energy from being a posty,
[13277.48s -> 13280.76s]  and please rest assured you'll never have a late parcel again.
[13282.47s -> 13283.91s]  Thank you both for the apology.
[13283.91s -> 13292.12s]  I accept it.
[13292.12s -> 13293.64s]  Hey, now that's all sorted.
[13293.64s -> 13297.38s]  I have an announcement to make.
[13297.38s -> 13300.95s]  Lobster Cop is no longer the number one best detective.
[13300.95s -> 13303.11s]  After some impeccable detective work on this case,
[13303.11s -> 13306.55s]  I'm really pleased to announce the new number one best detective is,
[13306.55s -> 13312.82s]  congratulations to Mr. Remonkey.
[13312.82s -> 13317.93s]  Wow, congratulations, Mr. Remonkey.
[13317.93s -> 13318.65s]  What an achievement.
[13319.99s -> 13321.51s]  I can't believe it.
[13321.51s -> 13322.63s]  Thank you so much.
[13323.51s -> 13327.83s]  I'll have to shut down my research facility so I can investigate full time.
[13327.83s -> 13330.70s]  You can move into my old office.
[13330.70s -> 13332.86s]  There's already a bunch of trophies in there for you to keep.
[13334.02s -> 13334.52s]  Great.
[13335.22s -> 13338.39s]  What an honor to work next door to the number one best detective.
[13338.39s -> 13342.15s]  Again, this calls for a celebration.
[13342.23s -> 13344.31s]  Barney, can you prep the saloon for a dance party?
[13346.26s -> 13347.45s]  Can do.
[13347.45s -> 13349.37s]  Oh, and lobster posty, posty mason mo?
[13350.30s -> 13351.30s]  Yeah.
[13351.30s -> 13355.58s]  You're invited too.
[13355.58s -> 13356.54s]  Let's party.
[13356.54s -> 13363.22s]  It's time for a dance party.
[13363.22s -> 13363.72s]  Yay.
[13364.18s -> 13364.68s]  Yay.
[13365.22s -> 13365.86s]  Oh, look.
[13365.86s -> 13366.36s]  Yay.
[13366.82s -> 13372.62s]  Holy shit, the lobster is going fucking hard.
[13377.19s -> 13377.69s]  Geez.
[13378.31s -> 13378.81s]  Jesus.
[13379.83s -> 13388.50s]  That was cute.
[13404.55s -> 13414.04s]  Hit the yoinky splinky.
[13414.04s -> 13415.32s]  Well, we have to wait till after the credits.
[13415.32s -> 13415.80s]  We can't.
[13415.80s -> 13416.44s]  I'm not going anywhere.
[13441.85s -> 13443.53s]  Why do I feel like these are mo-capped?
[13445.75s -> 13447.43s]  Don't they look mo-capped?
[13453.93s -> 13454.49s]  They are.
[13454.49s -> 13455.21s]  Okay.
[13455.21s -> 13463.98s]  Two weeks later.
[13463.98s -> 13474.10s]  Am I frog detective or am I mystery monkey?
[13474.10s -> 13477.08s]  Oh, look.
[13477.08s -> 13477.80s]  That's cute.
[13477.80s -> 13489.62s]  Frog detective, crime solving agency frog detective speaking.
[13489.62s -> 13492.23s]  How may I solve your mystery?
[13492.23s -> 13494.22s]  Hey, frog detective.
[13494.22s -> 13495.50s]  Yes, mystery monkey.
[13495.50s -> 13496.81s]  Happy birthday.
[13497.86s -> 13498.66s]  Thank you so much.
[13499.22s -> 13503.56s]  I know it's your birthday but I have a really difficult case.
[13503.56s -> 13505.82s]  I just can't crack.
[13505.82s -> 13508.86s]  But you're number one best detective.
[13508.86s -> 13511.40s]  I know but this one's a doozy.
[13511.40s -> 13513.78s]  Could you help me out?
[13513.78s -> 13514.18s]  Of course.
[13514.18s -> 13515.06s]  I'll be right there.
[13515.06s -> 13527.02s]  Why don't you call the phone?
[13527.02s -> 13533.58s]  Hey, detective.
[13533.58s -> 13534.46s]  Well, well, well.
[13534.46s -> 13536.70s]  Is it mystery monkey 49?
[13536.70s -> 13540.78s]  Good to see you, frog detective 03.
[13540.78s -> 13541.42s]  What?
[13541.42s -> 13543.46s]  Just a joke.
[13543.46s -> 13546.55s]  Are there two other frog detectives?
[13546.55s -> 13547.91s]  I don't know.
[13547.91s -> 13548.95s]  I was just joking.
[13548.95s -> 13551.27s]  You got me worried.
[13551.27s -> 13553.59s]  That really stresses me out.
[13553.59s -> 13557.83s]  Frog detective 1, frog detective 2, and now frog detective 3.
[13557.83s -> 13561.67s]  How do you think I feel with 48 other mystery monkeys?
[13561.67s -> 13563.29s]  Hmm.
[13563.29s -> 13564.01s]  Good point.
[13564.01s -> 13566.76s]  Anyway, thanks for meeting me here.
[13566.76s -> 13568.76s]  Case information is in the other room.
[13568.76s -> 13570.84s]  Just head down the hallway and I'll meet you there.
[13570.84s -> 13572.47s]  Will do.
[13572.47s -> 13590.02s]  Oh, it's all pasted over at this point.
[13590.02s -> 13620.02s]  Wait a minute.
[13620.02s -> 13624.30s]  It's a surprise birthday party.
[13624.30s -> 13625.58s]  Oh my god.
[13626.14s -> 13629.40s]  What's everybody doing here?
[13629.40s -> 13633.00s]  Well, detective, we appreciate everything you've done for us.
[13633.00s -> 13637.05s]  Yeah, our town has never been so peaceful all thanks to you.
[13637.05s -> 13641.38s]  Anyway, with my island, I haven't heard a ghost in ages.
[13641.38s -> 13644.81s]  I mean, technically, you never heard a ghost.
[13644.81s -> 13650.01s]  We heard it's your birthday so we all arranged to come here and surprise you.
[13650.01s -> 13650.97s]  It worked.
[13650.97s -> 13652.47s]  That's not all, detective.
[13652.47s -> 13653.67s]  We got you a present.
[13653.67s -> 13656.84s]  It should be coming any minute now.
[13656.84s -> 13660.68s]  I ordered it on whiz bay.
[13660.68s -> 13662.66s]  Oh, there it is.
[13666.04s -> 13668.20s]  Special birthday delivery.
[13668.20s -> 13673.00s]  Is that for me?
[13673.72s -> 13674.36s]  Open it up.
[13675.00s -> 13679.03s]  Oh, it's a hat that fits his head.
[13680.84s -> 13681.56s]  Happy birthday.
[13682.12s -> 13682.84s]  Wait, what is it?
[13683.56s -> 13684.36s]  That's easy, detective.
[13684.36s -> 13685.32s]  It's a hat.
[13685.32s -> 13686.04s]  I can't wear hats.
[13686.04s -> 13688.52s]  My head shape is I have a different head shape.
[13688.52s -> 13690.57s]  How don't you just try it on?
[13690.57s -> 13693.32s]  Oh, boy.
[13693.32s -> 13695.29s]  What the heck?
[13695.29s -> 13698.33s]  Oh, would you look at that?
[13699.06s -> 13712.34s]  It's a hat that fits like Arnold's hat from Hey Arnold.
[13712.34s -> 13713.70s]  Yeah, that's true.
[13715.08s -> 13716.28s]  Thank you for playing Frog Detective.
[13716.28s -> 13719.08s]  We have loved making these games for you and we are so grateful
[13719.08s -> 13722.28s]  that so many people have spent time with our silly story.
[13724.09s -> 13724.97s]  That was very cute.
[13724.97s -> 13725.53s]  It's very nice.
[13726.25s -> 13728.86s]  I'm glad I played it.
[13729.50s -> 13737.51s]  So is that the whole that's it then?
[13738.23s -> 13739.35s]  Three episodes, right?
[13740.07s -> 13747.67s]  Aren't these literally like $2 or something?
[13748.31s -> 13749.78s]  These are like less.
[13749.78s -> 13751.78s]  I think this game is less than $5 for each episode, right?
[13755.86s -> 13758.89s]  Five bucks trilogy.
[13758.89s -> 13763.37s]  Yeah, very cute.
[13765.00s -> 13765.48s]  Oh, okay.
[13765.48s -> 13765.88s]  Hold on.
[13766.52s -> 13774.73s]  The game actually ended on March 1st, so you have to eat a whole cake on stream.
[13776.31s -> 13780.47s]  No, it's 10 o'clock Pacific.
[13780.47s -> 13781.43s]  That's not accurate.
[13794.63s -> 13798.74s]  Yeah, so that's that's Frog Detective.
[13798.74s -> 13799.30s]  Really nice.
[13800.02s -> 13800.90s]  Close the book on that.
[13803.93s -> 13810.38s]  I want to play Hylix, but I think I think we're going to wait.
[13811.02s -> 13812.54s]  I don't think I want to start that right now.
[13812.54s -> 13814.06s]  I feel like I would only play for like an hour.
[13814.06s -> 13822.20s]  So here's the plan.
[13824.23s -> 13828.90s]  Uh, I want to make sure that all the Grotto Beast stuff is going smoothly.
[13831.62s -> 13837.80s]  So as of tomorrow, I don't know if I'm going to there will definitely be a stream on Thursday
[13837.80s -> 13842.63s]  on the second, but I just want to make sure everything's going well.
[13842.63s -> 13854.41s]  Keep an eye on the sus, but I'm imagining the next time I'll be live will be Thursday or Friday.
[13854.41s -> 13858.87s]  Also GrottoBeasts.net GrottoBeasts.net
[13858.87s -> 13864.18s]  We went over it in detail a couple hours ago, but that project is now available.
[13864.18s -> 13865.06s]  It's in presale.
[13865.06s -> 13866.42s]  It'll be in presale for a while.
[13866.42s -> 13879.08s]  If you feel like buying it, if you want to participate, it is available right now.
[13879.08s -> 13880.12s]  Pog, indeed.
[13880.76s -> 13893.13s]  Yeah, hope you had fun.
[13893.13s -> 13902.38s]  So you see why I waited so long to do this because oh my goodness, am I full of air?
[13902.38s -> 13904.98s]  Why am I full of helium today?
[13904.98s -> 13918.76s]  That's like the 15th time that's happened.
[13918.76s -> 13919.40s]  The end.
[13919.40s -> 13922.89s]  Yeah, over the next few days, because I don't want to,
[13922.89s -> 13925.59s]  I didn't want to overwhelm everybody with a bunch of stuff.
[13925.59s -> 13932.94s]  I'm going to show some of the merch and I'm going to show the box because I have access to it.
[13932.94s -> 13934.22s]  So you will see the product.
[13934.22s -> 13935.10s]  I'll have it in my hands.
[13935.10s -> 13936.38s]  We'll kind of go over it a little bit.
[13936.38s -> 13941.48s]  But I want it tonight to be sort of the announcement and the presale launch.
[13941.48s -> 13943.48s]  And maybe in a couple days we'll go over some more stuff,
[13943.48s -> 13946.28s]  but I don't want to overwhelm you or myself.
[13946.28s -> 13950.95s]  The pin tweet should now be GrottoBeasts.
[13950.95s -> 13953.19s]  That is absolutely what's going to happen.
[13953.19s -> 13956.33s]  GrottoBeasts.net
[13956.33s -> 13957.69s]  We got a starter kit.
[13957.69s -> 13961.06s]  We got card packs.
[13961.06s -> 13962.82s]  Hope you like it.
[13962.82s -> 13965.62s]  We'll be talking way more about this in the next couple of weeks.
[13965.62s -> 13969.85s]  I can assure you.
[13969.85s -> 13972.25s]  And I will see you guys in maybe a couple days.
[13972.25s -> 13988.01s]  Keep an eye on the sus.
[13988.01s -> 13989.77s]  Take care of yourselves.
[13989.77s -> 13993.90s]  Have a good one.
[13993.90s -> 13998.70s]  Yeah, Breath of the Wild will show up again soon.
[13998.70s -> 14004.10s]  Once we run out of stuff to do, some of these games that I've been trying to finish.
[14006.20s -> 14007.32s]  Yeah, we'll play it again.
[14007.32s -> 14008.04s]  I will.
[14008.04s -> 14010.36s]  I'm going to finish it absolutely before the new one comes out.
[14010.36s -> 14011.70s]  That's for sure.
[14011.70s -> 14015.77s]  And then I'll wait like a year to play the new one or something, right?
[14023.03s -> 14023.99s]  We'll see you in a couple days.
[14025.53s -> 14026.01s]  Good night.
[14026.73s -> 14027.21s]  Goodbye.
[14028.47s -> 14029.43s]  Call your mother.
[14029.43s -> 14030.65s]  Take care of yourselves.
[14033.46s -> 14035.22s]  Good job on GrottoBeasts and the team.
[14035.94s -> 14038.42s]  We really appreciate it.
[14038.42s -> 14039.38s]  When you get it in your hands,
[14040.34s -> 14044.34s]  I hope that you open it and say this was worth it.
[14044.34s -> 14045.27s]  I hope so.
[14052.76s -> 14054.20s]  Have a fantastic night.
[14054.84s -> 14058.63s]  See you guys soon.
[14058.63s -> 14169.91s]  Take care.
