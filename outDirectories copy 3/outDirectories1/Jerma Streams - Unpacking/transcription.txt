[10.10s -> 18.41s]  I'm so excited for this. Yeah, let's do it. Hopefully it's not too loud. We'll find out.
[27.19s -> 67.90s]  Why unpacking? I don't know, because I feel like it. I have played this game, haven't I?
[69.18s -> 75.51s]  I think me and Holly played it for a little bit. I feel like I've watched Holly. Like, I fell asleep
[75.51s -> 87.32s]  to Holly playing this. Calm down? What? I know, I, I, I just realized you can't see it. Come on.
[92.34s -> 107.59s]  I know, I'm working on it. Yeah, there already was a save file. I think I, I fell, I fell
[107.59s -> 117.53s]  asleep to Holly playing this. It was so relaxing. All right, you ready? So I think, yeah, I can open
[117.53s -> 124.58s]  up boxes. It's pre-recorded. No, it's not. All right, so I got to decorate the room.
[125.46s -> 131.86s]  Work faster. That's not the point of this, is to do it as slow as you can. You do this as slow as
[131.86s -> 147.56s]  possible. I don't like it. I don't like this. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I gotta,
[147.56s -> 153.62s]  stop, stop. I'm freaking out. All right, stop. Put it away. Okay, I would put a soccer ball.
[153.62s -> 156.58s]  I'm gonna do this the way I would do it. Of course, I'm gonna put the trophy right here.
[157.78s -> 168.73s]  There's no time limit. Wouldn't be going too slow. I'm gonna, I want the money in the bed.
[169.45s -> 176.55s]  This is like art stuff. I'm gonna put it up here with the other art stuff.
[177.43s -> 189.42s]  This is a diary or something. Put it away. Uh, trash. Uh, put the game away too. Only take that
[189.42s -> 198.62s]  out when friends come over. Yeah, put this stuff away. It goes here. Cool. Speed. I like this. This
[198.70s -> 209.34s]  is fun. There's a game change. You're going too slow. I'm gonna start. I'm gonna start.
[209.34s -> 215.77s]  I'm gonna start timing you up. I'm gonna tie you up for real. You're getting timed out. Okay.
[216.89s -> 239.34s]  This is a nice place for that. I don't want this in my room. How do I put this away? I don't want
[239.34s -> 251.46s]  this in here. Put them in the bed. I don't want this in the room. Now, this is a book. Put the
[251.46s -> 260.41s]  toy. Okay. Toys are going on this side. All right. That's no, no, no. This is going in here.
[261.30s -> 264.02s]  Check this out. This is going to be where the, my journal is going to go in here.
[265.38s -> 268.66s]  Now that's safe. And the scissors can fit in there too. Everything can, right?
[269.46s -> 282.73s]  That's perfect. That's good. I don't want this in the room. That's like school supplies that's going
[282.73s -> 297.64s]  there. What's that? What the hell is this? All right. That's kind of cool. You can sit out there.
[297.64s -> 301.74s]  Flashlight. Just put it, put it away. I don't need it. Put the books over here.
[302.70s -> 327.74s]  Dear me, this is a choking hazard. Wait, how old am I? You're supposed to be three? What? I'm
[327.74s -> 345.58s]  supposed to be three, 23. Don't even. All right. That's fine. Just put all the stuffed animals in
[345.58s -> 383.62s]  the bed. How would I even lie in this bed? I have too much stuff. What is this? I'll put this, oh,
[383.62s -> 405.85s]  on the sill. That's fine. All right. That's good. My bed has more than that. I got it. What's wrong
[405.85s -> 425.48s]  with this? These are wrong. Just put them away. This is the most stressful game I've ever played.
[426.58s -> 459.32s]  Why? Finally, my own room. Quick playback. I try to throw the dinosaur away like five times.
[459.88s -> 486.70s]  Tool assistant speed run. That looks fine. Okay. 2004. This is like a college room.
[487.74s -> 500.81s]  All right. This computer, computer's gonna go right here. I don't have like 40 stuffed animals,
[500.81s -> 508.36s]  right? This is a flute. I didn't mean to do that. I'm an idiot. All right. This is a book.
[508.36s -> 523.13s]  All right. Books are gonna go over here. Stand them up. All right. These are art supplies.
[523.13s -> 531.29s]  Um, oh, there's a kitchen and there's a bathtub. All right. All right. All right. All right. Right.
[531.29s -> 537.93s]  Right. Right. I gotta put this. I think I remember watching like I was, my eye was like this and I
[537.93s -> 545.56s]  remember going like this and seeing like flashes of this while Holly was like organizing stuff.
[545.56s -> 557.67s]  I was just like, I was definitely not dreaming. All right. I'm gonna put these up here for now.
[557.67s -> 569.98s]  These markers. I don't know if I'm up here. Book or books. I don't give, I don't give a
[569.98s -> 580.49s]  shit about books. All right. This can go here. I don't know what that is. It's going up with books.
[581.37s -> 603.21s]  What's that? I don't know what that is. Oh, it's a poster. Okay. Well, put it right here.
[605.64s -> 622.12s]  Book. Book. We got a lot of books. Uh, toothbrush. Oh, no, no, no. Take this to the bathroom.
[622.76s -> 662.52s]  Put that up here. Pants. Sneaker. What's the other one? Okay. Okay. A boot.
[663.16s -> 676.26s]  Remember, that's a mouse pad. This is a mouse pad. I don't want this ruler anyway. Get us out of here.
[683.14s -> 719.29s]  Okay. Whatever. This doesn't go under. Okay. These are, these are bras. Perfect. Gameboy. Uh,
[719.29s -> 736.71s]  put it on the shelf. Scratchy scratch. What is that? Files? Put it over here.
[737.43s -> 751.74s]  Why a toaster? Why do you have a toaster? Oh, because of the kitchen. Right. Hold on.
[752.38s -> 772.12s]  To make toast. Yeah, but still. I can hang those up. I don't think I want to do that, though.
[773.24s -> 776.60s]  I hate hangers. They just give you two spikes on your shoulders. I hate it.
[777.48s -> 791.83s]  But I'll do it for now. You don't know what I'm talking about? When you, okay,
[791.83s -> 795.59s]  when you put something on a hanger and it sits in there for a long enough time,
[796.15s -> 803.93s]  you end up getting this shit. It looks like this and there's nothing you can do to get rid of it.
[803.93s -> 822.17s]  It just looks like this. You have to wash the shirt to get rid of it. It's like an iPod.
[822.89s -> 856.02s]  Get a smaller hanger. I'm not, no, I'm not using a meat hook. I get, I get this shit out of the way.
[856.02s -> 867.51s]  I can't see. Okay. Jeans are going to go there. Fuck. Okay. Hold on. Hang up the ones that you
[867.51s -> 873.58s]  should hang up. Fold the t-shirts. T-shirts are going to go here. Hang this up right here.
[873.58s -> 880.62s]  All right. Sweaters, sweatshirts. This looks like an alarm clock. It is. Yeah. Fold up the shirts.
[880.62s -> 903.88s]  Hang up the big ones. What is that? What is all this stuff? I think this is pants. Should I do
[903.88s -> 912.95s]  this by color? I don't care. I genuinely don't care. I just reach in and grab clothes. I don't
[912.95s -> 962.78s]  care. Oh, right. I got it. Is there any more? What is all this shit? Too much stuff. I just want,
[962.78s -> 967.91s]  I told you like my, I should do this the way that I would actually do my room. And I'm telling you
[967.91s -> 976.70s]  right now, it is not like this. Just look at all that. You can't, you, you can't even move in here.
[976.70s -> 1013.85s]  There's no room. There's just no room to move in here. I can't breathe in this room. Why are
[1013.85s -> 1017.93s]  all your socks on the bed? I kind of just seen what I needed to get them all out first before
[1017.93s -> 1049.58s]  I put them away. I don't like this up here. This needs to be here. Okay. Now what? Why is there
[1049.58s -> 1090.49s]  only one shoe? Towel? What is that? This is bag. A health kit. Don't act like you don't do that.
[1090.49s -> 1106.87s]  Don't act like you don't do that either. Don't act like you don't do that either. Quiet. Okay. I just
[1106.87s -> 1118.63s]  gotta get stuff out of box first. This is toothpaste. This is a brush. I'm gonna put this here.
[1119.51s -> 1128.63s]  This is soap. We're gonna put it here. Although gross, gross, gross. I, no, I don't use that shit.
[1128.63s -> 1146.84s]  I don't do that. Gross. Yeah. I don't, I don't smear around then lather up a big ball of
[1147.88s -> 1154.12s]  fucking bar soap, smear it all over my body and then place that shit on there for it to get like
[1155.00s -> 1158.60s]  stuck on. And even if you use a tray, it gets just stuck on the tray.
[1159.78s -> 1167.83s]  Bar soap is fucking dog shit. I'm sorry. It's dog shit. You just use a little bit of gel soap,
[1167.83s -> 1176.94s]  a little bit of body wash, lather it up, scrub it up. I, you know, I actually like Irish spring
[1179.19s -> 1184.17s]  for one reason, because the guy in the commercial used to be like, this is the Irish spring and he
[1184.17s -> 1191.43s]  would be cutting it. He had a knife and he would be cutting the soap and he had a, it was an Irish
[1191.43s -> 1198.78s]  guy. So I was like, Oh wow. Irish spring. I thought it was actually from a, I thought it was like
[1198.78s -> 1205.75s]  from a really, really rare resource in Ireland. I don't believe, I don't think that now obviously,
[1205.75s -> 1212.15s]  but when I was younger, I really thought it was a rare thing. Oh, only from the finest of the Irish
[1212.15s -> 1224.97s]  springs. You fell for the ads. Yeah. When I was 12, 13, maybe 11, not like I was 20, 30 years old.
[1225.77s -> 1232.82s]  I thought it was some rare ingredients from some incredibly exotic place, like deep underground
[1232.82s -> 1250.09s]  and some spring and I don't know. This is like an espresso cup. How's the bathroom look? I don't
[1250.09s -> 1254.50s]  like this. In fact, I don't, I don't think I even want this in here. What do I want this?
[1255.38s -> 1260.49s]  Is this deodorant? And I guess that would sit here.
[1264.06s -> 1286.42s]  I'm okay with that. Towel. What are you doing? Washing the utensils first because they've been
[1286.42s -> 1302.38s]  in a box for probably a month. Is this, yeah, you put the bug stuff down here. This is George
[1302.38s -> 1311.82s]  Warman. Does it go down here too? No, it would be like here. There's a scale. Uh,
[1312.70s -> 1327.00s]  put that here because it looks all right there. Pot. Put it up here. It's a cutting board. I know.
[1327.00s -> 1337.46s]  You think I didn't know? All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is,
[1341.83s -> 1352.84s]  I thought, okay, this is not a poster. That's garbage bags, sponges, spatula. All right. Let's
[1352.84s -> 1360.38s]  get some stuff situated here. Toaster is going to go here. Is this a dishwashing soap? And then
[1360.38s -> 1368.78s]  what is this? Okay. This is hand soap, obviously. What is, pine saw? What is that? What is this?
[1369.42s -> 1385.46s]  What's the difference? This is cooking oil. Oh, okay. Well, then it goes here. Cups. Cups
[1385.46s -> 1418.92s]  that go up here. Sugar. Put the spices and shit up here. Put the money away. I don't want to
[1418.92s -> 1464.94s]  advertise like my money. Why would I do that? Glassware will go, um, shit. I don't want all
[1464.94s -> 1503.98s]  this. What, like, what is all this stuff? Bingo. All right. Hold on. When am I going to put all
[1503.98s -> 1535.80s]  this? How am I going to reach this shit ever? I'm never going to be able to grab this stuff.
[1535.80s -> 1540.42s]  All right. Let's be honest. I'm only going to use this thing once a year. So let's put this stuff
[1540.42s -> 1554.22s]  down here that I don't need down here. What's wrong with this? I don't get it. What's the problem?
[1554.94s -> 1576.98s]  What's the problem? I can't have towels out. What? I put my shoes at the door. I don't,
[1576.98s -> 1646.58s]  what's the issue? All right, let's go. Let's take a look at speedrun. I was so zoomed in. Nice.
[1651.14s -> 1667.02s]  Very nice. 2007. Oh God. Okay. Oh goodness. I already have this bunch of shit over here.
[1667.02s -> 1671.59s]  There's already stuff here. There's some shit here already. Can I throw some stuff away?
[1672.39s -> 1681.06s]  I can't move anything else. I would just throw everything away. Well, I mean, I wouldn't,
[1681.06s -> 1685.54s]  but like in the game, I mean, I wouldn't just throw everything away. I'm just saying in the
[1685.54s -> 1689.94s]  context of this video game, I would just get rid of the stuff so I could put new stuff out.
[1690.90s -> 1701.29s]  You have a roommate? That makes it even worse. Can you imagine coming in and your roommate has
[1701.29s -> 1708.20s]  five or six contractor trash bags full of stuff? Hey, what's it? What's in the bags?
[1709.24s -> 1712.04s]  Oh, nothing. I'm just making a couple trips to the dumpster. Not a big deal.
[1713.00s -> 1734.55s]  You throw every single thing they own away. Wow. That would be awful. That's a power move. What
[1734.63s -> 1743.62s]  even is this? I don't know. Put it over here for now. Close. No, I gotta, we gotta, where's the
[1743.62s -> 1750.52s]  bedroom? Oh man. This is going to be so much of a pain in the ass. All right. I'm going to go fast.
[1751.16s -> 1762.50s]  I'm, I'm, I don't know. I can't pay attention to this. I can't do it. There's too much stuff.
[1762.50s -> 1768.07s]  I can't do it. I can't this. I, I don't care what to do with this thing. I don't want to
[1772.07s -> 1777.27s]  put some effort into this guys. Every time I've moved, I really sit there and look at all my stuff
[1777.27s -> 1782.87s]  and go, I just want to smash all this up with a hammer and the throne in the trash. I swear.
[1782.87s -> 1795.30s]  Sometimes you just look around and you just like, fuck it. Fuck this. You don't do it,
[1795.30s -> 1801.24s]  but you sit there and you have this, this thought of just, I really would love to put this all in
[1801.24s -> 1821.80s]  a trash compactor and just watch it get crushed. Okay. Where we need a box of the pans. Look at
[1821.80s -> 1828.94s]  all this. It's like, there's each, there's markers for each different like day of the week. This is
[1828.94s -> 1834.94s]  why I try not to own anything. I just, I, I want, I want just a, such a small amount of stuff.
[1834.94s -> 1841.66s]  I want the stuff that makes me, do I need it to survive? Yes. Okay. Toilet paper. You need that.
[1842.76s -> 1849.74s]  You need a rag, right? You need a good rag. You need stuff in the bathroom, a toothbrush. I don't
[1849.74s -> 1853.90s]  need all these books. I don't need all these things. I don't, I don't, I don't need all this other
[1853.90s -> 1863.91s]  shit. I just, honestly, I just need a pan to cook food in. I just, you need to only need a few pans.
[1864.79s -> 1868.79s]  Sometimes you go to kitchens and the person's like a master fucking chef. They have
[1868.79s -> 1875.40s]  15 different pans. It's like, do you even know the last time you even used that like extra large
[1875.40s -> 1890.15s]  wok? What, what, what do you mean? What? What's wrong with all this? You guys understand that this
[1890.15s -> 1898.60s]  is almost everything I own is in here and in that closet. This is almost every object that I own.
[1900.36s -> 1905.88s]  This is my whole life is this shelf here. All of my possessions are there and right there. I don't,
[1905.88s -> 1915.35s]  I don't like have anything else. I keep some consoles and some games and stuff. I have
[1915.91s -> 1929.02s]  three or four pans. Couch. I got a VR headset. I don't know. I don't like stuff. I don't like
[1929.02s -> 1935.13s]  a bunch of stuff. Yeah. I don't know. I don't like stuff. Like for instance, to me, this is stuff.
[1935.13s -> 1940.33s]  This is stuff. This is, I would get rid of it. Let me tell you what would go in this room. You're
[1940.33s -> 1948.52s]  ready. No, it's a book. Get rid of it. What am I going to write down? Alarm clock. Nope. I have a
[1948.52s -> 1954.44s]  phone. I don't need that. What is this? Some random magazine postcard. Put it on the fridge for six
[1954.44s -> 1959.69s]  months. After six months, have it lapsed. Take it off. Oh, you sent me a picture of, of, of like
[1959.69s -> 1963.61s]  your kids or something or like, Oh, something that like a cool thing. It's going on the fridge for
[1963.61s -> 1971.30s]  six to 12 months and it's coming off. What's this? Another one. Nope. I wouldn't have any of this.
[1971.30s -> 1978.17s]  I have a phone and I don't even listen to music. So I don't need this. A hanger. You're going to
[1978.17s -> 1985.53s]  bring a hanger with you. Okay. No. What did you, what did somebody just said? Something about how
[1985.53s -> 2002.15s]  I did. I lived out of a shoe. Like a lady from that nursery rhyme who lived in the shoe. What is this?
[2002.79s -> 2018.70s]  I want to show you guys something. Cause it's very important. This is my mouse pad. You want to see
[2018.70s -> 2024.78s]  how I don't own anything. I don't care. This is my mouse pad. I've had, I've been using the same
[2024.78s -> 2030.06s]  mouse pad for fucking almost 10 straight. This is a magic of wizard wars mouse pad. This is what I
[2030.06s -> 2037.40s]  use. I don't play this game. I don't give a shit about this game or this entire franchise. I don't
[2037.40s -> 2047.24s]  care. Magic of fucking wizard wars guys. I don't need anything else. I don't need another one.
[2047.24s -> 2055.59s]  Why would I get another one? What do I care? I've owned this since 2011. I think buy a new one. I
[2055.59s -> 2062.52s]  don't need a new one. This one works. This works just fine. It's just this floppy. Oh look, I'm
[2062.52s -> 2070.36s]  going to make thunder. I, I, you don't need, I don't need another one. If it were up to me,
[2070.36s -> 2079.50s]  I would just do it on my shin. I mean my thigh. If it worked, I used an Amazon basics keyboard
[2079.50s -> 2086.34s]  for five years. That thing was $9 on Amazon. I don't need stuff. I don't care about stuff.
[2086.98s -> 2116.70s]  This thing probably smells. I'll be, I'll give you a real review. I promise. Um, it's just,
[2116.70s -> 2125.22s]  I don't know. It smells like the inside of a closet. It doesn't, it doesn't smell bad. It smells
[2125.22s -> 2142.36s]  like whatever. Now I got to put this back over here. It stinks. No, it doesn't stink. It just
[2142.36s -> 2152.33s]  smells like fucking rubber. You should taste it. No, stop being childish. God's sake. Stop being
[2152.33s -> 2157.53s]  so, all right. Now underneath here, for instance. Now that's gross. Now that's just not nice. I
[2157.53s -> 2163.06s]  clean this from a lot, but that's just, that's just, that's just not okay. That just looks bad.
[2167.34s -> 2172.06s]  You're used to the smell. What, you want me to breeze my mouse pad?
[2173.58s -> 2185.22s]  Guys, I have one other mouse pad. Give me a second. I need to see if I still have it.
[2185.22s -> 2188.34s]  You're going to fucking shit your pants laughing if I can get it. I'm right back.
[2188.98s -> 2220.47s]  I got it. I got it. Okay. Are you ready? Are you ready for me to reveal the other mouse pad that I
[2220.47s -> 2259.11s]  own? Okay. Here we go. It's a Superman holographic mouse pad. It's pretty cool. Should I use this
[2259.11s -> 2271.67s]  instead of the Magica Wizard Wars one? What do you think? Is this worth any money? Does it make a
[2271.67s -> 2301.30s]  sound when you scratch it? What the fuck? It's been a rough day today. Everybody shut up. You're
[2301.30s -> 2315.50s]  ruining the surface. That's the only other mouse pad I own. I just don't care. I don't care. I don't
[2315.50s -> 2322.22s]  own stuff. I, I get, look, I would, I will spend money on, on things that are very essential that
[2322.30s -> 2343.02s]  I find essential. For instance, a nice fucking meal. Nice fucking delicious meal. I have McDonald's.
[2344.34s -> 2354.92s]  Not at McDonald's. Superman mouse pad is essential. You're acting like I bought this recently.
[2354.92s -> 2371.13s]  Yeah. I, I, I don't, I don't even know where I got it. You eat McDonald's and shit.
[2373.69s -> 2381.51s]  Just because I eat McDonald's doesn't mean that's the only food I eat. Oh, I like McDonald's. You
[2381.51s -> 2386.79s]  eat it three meals a day, every single fucking day. It's not what I said. I just said I enjoy
[2386.79s -> 2403.96s]  that restaurant. All right. What, I gotta get this, I gotta, hold on. This is some kind of
[2405.00s -> 2414.71s]  tablet or something. Why do I not have the thing to put this on? Why is it? Wait, I'll make it,
[2414.71s -> 2419.03s]  you know, here's the idea. You put it that far away. So then when it actually beeps, you have
[2419.03s -> 2422.71s]  to get up and climb up the shit to turn it off. So you, you make sure you're going to get up for it.
[2423.35s -> 2449.93s]  This is all wrong. All wrong. Maybe you didn't have so much bullshit. Where the fuck am I
[2450.01s -> 2460.26s]  supposed to put all this shit? Why do I have business cards out on my own desk? I know who I am.
[2461.06s -> 2501.80s]  Put these away. So many books. Oh, just get the digital one. Too many books. Too many books.
[2502.44s -> 2513.51s]  How come there's no end table or anything? Am I going to put all my stuff on the ground?
[2514.23s -> 2569.48s]  Take the other side. Okay, whatever. Bottoms are going here. Tops go in there. And then underwear
[2569.48s -> 2581.30s]  is going in here. A lot of pain in the ass. Oh, this hurts me. Oh, I just hate it.
[2589.51s -> 2622.55s]  Okay, thank God. I hate it. I hate it. Oh, get this out. Throw them away. This is going
[2622.55s -> 2629.91s]  to somewhere else. Look at all the stuff we have. You understand that we probably had
[2630.47s -> 2635.83s]  20 more encyclopedias, but they're being taken up by like Crunchy the Cockroach.
[2636.47s -> 2658.82s]  Like a bunch of action figures. This can go back here. Come on, get back there. Can I go under the
[2658.82s -> 2681.56s]  bed? That's not a bad place for it. Good, good, good. Feels good. The worst possible place to
[2681.56s -> 2688.84s]  put a tower because you can't ever touch the back of it. I hate this. I have my tower right here
[2689.40s -> 2691.88s]  and it's not enclosed by a bunch of this shit and I still hate it.
[2692.84s -> 2724.30s]  What's that? Frisbee? Hey, leave that under there for like 10 years. Is that a shoe? What is this?
[2725.18s -> 2740.07s]  That's a squished up shoe. Is that a paint can? What is this? Honest to God, what is this? This
[2740.07s -> 2761.08s]  looks like a Ghostbuster trap. What is this thing? What is that? It's climbing chalk? Chalk bag for
[2761.08s -> 2811.64s]  climbing. Okay. No, get back here. There's not enough room in this closet. There's no fucking room
[2811.64s -> 2839.30s]  in this goddamn closet. That's the, that's a pants hanger. What is this? A yoga mat or something?
[2854.63s -> 2858.87s]  This was so small when I took it out, I thought it was a Pez container. This is a trash can.
[2861.50s -> 2865.02s]  Yeah, good luck throwing one item in here and then needing to take the whole bag out.
[2865.82s -> 2895.88s]  This is all fucked up. This is, look at all fucked up. This is, this is fucked up. Look at all the
[2895.88s -> 2912.20s]  stuff on the desk. Alright, looking good so far. Not bad. Okay. Dining room. More books.
[2913.00s -> 2924.33s]  Let's be, let's be realistic with ourselves here. Everybody that has all these books,
[2925.29s -> 2931.53s]  they buy them. They like open them in bed and they read three pages and they close it and they just
[2931.53s -> 2956.20s]  pretend like they're reading it. I knew for a fact that was going to get somebody. People are just
[2956.20s -> 3011.43s]  like, I fucking read. What is he saying? Oh, back to the living room. Alright. I would never do this.
[3011.43s -> 3017.13s]  This is stupid. There's already a visual here for the television for you to look at. So putting
[3017.13s -> 3024.73s]  another visual right behind it is, that's dog shit feng shui. That's bad. This is no, because
[3024.73s -> 3045.98s]  there's another visual right behind it. This is going somewhere else. Too many visuals. Is that
[3045.98s -> 3095.06s]  GameCube? I hear the games. Let's get the games over here. A little blanket. Cool. All the vents
[3095.06s -> 3115.10s]  are blocked. Oh my god, look at this shit. Um, too much stuff. There's another thing I don't know
[3115.10s -> 3123.83s]  what to do with. Okay, I'm gonna take this down. Put these, can these fit up here? That can. Too
[3123.83s -> 3140.01s]  many things. That works. Alright, that works. I can sit under there. Alright, kitchen. More mugs.
[3142.18s -> 3154.47s]  Towel. Mug. I've been drinking out of the same coffee cups for five to ten years too.
[3157.26s -> 3183.72s]  Guys have a problem with that? Yeah, as long as you wash it. Oh yeah, of course I do. What is this?
[3185.45s -> 3206.10s]  Oh, it's a magnet. Have you been shitting out of the same ass? Yes. What a weird, what a weirdo.
[3207.86s -> 3257.69s]  Organized. This can't fit in there. Whatever. Medic kit. Sponges. Spatula. Spoon. Cutting board.
[3258.57s -> 3262.66s]  Alright, I think this is like a towel. This is going in the other, this is gonna bathroom.
[3267.16s -> 3278.01s]  Towel. Alright, toothbrush. I'm not putting my toothbrush up here. This is coming with me in the
[3278.01s -> 3289.32s]  bedroom. This is coming with me in the bedroom. No, I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[3289.32s -> 3293.98s]  like to, I don't want to leave my shit up. When I'm done brushing my teeth, this is getting put in a
[3293.98s -> 3331.22s]  little plastic bag and I'm bringing it into my bedroom. Putting it in a drawer. Holy shit, look
[3331.22s -> 3361.32s]  at these. Those are Costco. Those are bulk. Damn. Spray. That's horse shampoo. How much shit does
[3361.32s -> 3383.08s]  this person have? That, thank you for saying that. Thank you. Alright, so what's the problem?
[3384.63s -> 3390.23s]  All of this apparently shouldn't be here. Where else are they supposed to go? Put it, you gotta
[3390.23s -> 3398.98s]  put your clothes away. You gotta put your shoes away. Put your shoes away. No. Actually, my shoes
[3398.98s -> 3410.86s]  are at just the front door of wherever you live. They're just at the front. I'm not putting these
[3410.86s -> 3422.89s]  all in here. They're just at the front door and these can't even fit. Yeah, that's good.
[3427.16s -> 3431.19s]  This looks good. What's up? Is there a problem? Kitchen's a problem. For what?
[3433.06s -> 3440.04s]  Oh, sorry. My mistake. There were two towels on the counter. I'm so sorry. I will fix this
[3440.04s -> 3450.86s]  immediately. God, what a bonehead. What a dumb, what an idiot. Forget about all the dirty fucking
[3450.86s -> 3460.38s]  dishes in the sink or all the other bullshit that's up here. Let's see the speed run.
[3461.10s -> 3494.28s]  Okay, so am I just really doing this? Am I doing the same speed? Am I just weirdly
[3495.24s -> 3498.28s]  consistent with how fast I did this? Or is it just going to put it out no matter what?
[3499.32s -> 3524.46s]  Hey, you don't watch a spider make its web. You just see the end result. So please
[3525.18s -> 3550.18s]  spare me the criticisms. Those just jumped around on their own. How do I get a better view?
[3551.14s -> 3601.64s]  There's two zoomed in. Hey, remember this rant? God, it's like it was yesterday. 2010. Okay,
[3601.64s -> 3629.66s]  what is that? Oh, what is it? Pet bug? I can move everything. Is this mine? Why can I move
[3629.66s -> 3636.52s]  the guitars and TV and the dumbbells? Whatever. Okay, what we got? I have to make sure everybody
[3636.52s -> 3640.20s]  knows that I play D&D. It's the first thing that I want them to see so I can have an hour long
[3640.20s -> 3649.58s]  conversation with them about D&D. They go, Hey, man, what's this thing? Oh, well, let me tell you
[3649.58s -> 3676.26s]  something about Dungeons and Dragons. How much time do you have? It's like a mini ukulele. Oh,
[3676.26s -> 3691.99s]  wow. Look at this. We've got a super closet now. Perfect place for my shirts. Who's this messy
[3691.99s -> 3702.09s]  person? Look at this messy bullshit. It's not a bowling alley. Okay. Symmetrical and flush.
[3712.54s -> 3729.02s]  It's messy. Just rip these doors off. Just take these doors off. All they do is just cause a
[3729.02s -> 3735.98s]  huge problem. They're a massive pain in the ass. Those of you that have ever had to use these doors
[3735.98s -> 3741.18s]  before. Fuck these things. They come off the first day I move in. I don't care. Without a doubt.
[3744.74s -> 3769.19s]  First day. Of course, gonna bring my Game Boy everywhere I go. Those are cigarettes.
[3784.07s -> 3797.00s]  What is it? Why do you have these? Oh, how much underwear? Is this underwear? How much
[3797.00s -> 3805.30s]  underwear do we have? This is kind of a lot of underwear. Are we planning on shitting our pants
[3805.30s -> 3840.30s]  a lot? Are these socks? Are these socks or is it underwear? It's both. What are these?
[3841.02s -> 3845.46s]  Get these fucking fruit roll-ups out of here. These ties, I think, right?
[3846.26s -> 3867.38s]  Game's gonna get mad at me for putting the shoes in the wrong place.
[3891.61s -> 3895.61s]  Just grab them and like the Hulk rip them off. I hate these things so much.
[3911.27s -> 3920.76s]  What am I supposed to do with this? I don't do what this is like. Degree? What am I supposed
[3920.76s -> 3925.98s]  to do with this? I don't, there's nowhere for me to hang this. I'm just gonna put my degree in
[3925.98s -> 3955.02s]  the bathroom. I don't care. That's where it belongs. These shoes are all mismatched. I don't care.
[3955.66s -> 3973.77s]  It doesn't belong. All right, let me take these markers. I think
[3974.41s -> 3997.94s]  put these back here. Look at this mess of a living room. Come on. I brought these everywhere.
[3997.94s -> 4037.82s]  Too many books. That just really is. I'm sorry. I know that like a lot of people like books and
[4037.82s -> 4052.73s]  stuff so that I don't like books. I just they take up a lot of space. It's just too much shit.
[4062.26s -> 4065.78s]  This is important though. I would say this is very important. That's the most important thing
[4065.78s -> 4082.09s]  that I've packed is the chicken thing. And this, I don't, let's put this in the bedroom.
[4082.09s -> 4096.10s]  If I could move it, I would. Look at all these. What the fuck are these all for?
[4097.14s -> 4104.86s]  Why has that many of those? This is bullshit. Everybody that owns more than one of these,
[4105.42s -> 4113.26s]  you go, you fan, you see five to 10 pages with shit on it. The rest is empty. And it's like that
[4113.26s -> 4121.94s]  across every single one of them. You don't need all these. The first five pages have stuff on this
[4121.94s -> 4133.94s]  and the rest is blank. There's sketchbooks. There's a lot. You don't know how to read.
[4133.94s -> 4150.55s]  You don't know how art works. It's an artist. But I mean, it's a lot of books. Look at all these
[4150.55s -> 4158.81s]  large cheese pizzas that I have to put across my whole house. Think about that. I have to find room
[4158.81s -> 4184.39s]  for like 25 pizza hut boxes. And by the way, how dare you be this talented? How dare you be
[4184.39s -> 4200.98s]  this talented to have that much material? There's another pizza. I don't know where
[4200.98s -> 4223.96s]  to put this other pizza. Here comes a backpedal. Do you guys hear that? What the fuck was that?
[4224.60s -> 4261.56s]  That sound was coming from my speaker. It was weird. Yeah. What time is it? Six 23. Nine.
[4262.20s -> 4279.14s]  What? I'm so confused. I'm sorry, but this is a GameCube house. We're gonna put this one,
[4279.14s -> 4300.62s]  we're gonna put this one in the closet. I don't fucking want this thing. I just get rid, I don't
[4300.62s -> 4342.71s]  care. Okay. Cookies important. Measuring tablespoons. What was that? Molasses. Oil. Oil.
[4342.71s -> 4370.15s]  Garlic powder. Thyme. Has this one been here for more than six months? I gotta, is there a place I
[4370.15s -> 4383.26s]  can put this? What even is this? Is this leftovers? Why do I have like takeout still? Throw this away.
[4383.26s -> 4397.82s]  All right. Salt and pepper gonna be on the table. Is this coffee? I think. Whatever. What is this?
[4397.82s -> 4403.75s]  It was a marijuana scale. What are you doing? What is this? Why is this here? What is this for?
[4404.47s -> 4423.40s]  Is this a juicer? It's a cooking scale? By a show of hands, one being yes, two being no.
[4424.04s -> 4430.20s]  Do you have a cooking scale in your house? And do you have you used it? One is yes. Two is no.
[4430.28s -> 4437.64s]  Fucking liars. No way. Liars. Lie. Lie. Lie. I see a liars. I don't see anything but liars.
[4439.00s -> 4442.60s]  You've used, you use one of these on a regular cooking scale?
[4443.56s -> 4453.83s]  I have, I have never like sprinkled shit on a cooking scale and weighed it out to exact. No,
[4453.83s -> 4471.93s]  you just eyeball that shit. It's not for cooking. It's for baking. But just follow the recipe.
[4473.53s -> 4483.11s]  I need one tablespoon of baking soda. Here it is. I don't, do I need to put that on the scale?
[4494.65s -> 4500.01s]  Do you cook often? I do cook, but I don't, I don't like weigh my fucking cheeseburger patties on a
[4500.01s -> 4512.84s]  marijuana weed scale. I've never heard of people doing this. Yeah, guys, I make like turkey
[4512.84s -> 4518.36s]  sandwiches. I don't weigh the deli meat and go, I had to make sure I have at least 0.2 grams of
[4518.36s -> 4523.40s]  turkey meat. I make eggs. I don't, I just crack the eggs in the pan and fucking eat them.
[4524.52s -> 4529.74s]  If I'm going to be baking, I just bake cookies. I don't need to, what am I weighing? What am
[4529.74s -> 4536.70s]  I weighing it for? What's it for? That's not cooking. If I bake salmon in the oven,
[4537.58s -> 4548.50s]  I don't need to weigh, what am I, what am I using it for? Dude, it's sad what you're saying.
[4553.06s -> 4559.77s]  Volumetric baking. Okay, but, but if you don't bake, you don't need one of these.
[4560.73s -> 4566.01s]  I just like making pasta is pasta. Making a salad, I just make the salad. I just cut up some tomatoes
[4566.01s -> 4570.25s]  and fucking onions, red onions, swirl it around, put it in the thing, press the button so it spins,
[4570.25s -> 4575.61s]  spins, spins, spins, spins like a merry-go-round. I would put, I'm going to put a whole turkey in
[4575.61s -> 4588.54s]  the oven. You just put a turkey in the oven. It's for baking recipes. I don't, I don't bake.
[4589.50s -> 4598.06s]  A lot of, I don't bake. What I do is I shave onions into the pan, mushrooms, chop up the
[4598.06s -> 4601.66s]  mushrooms, chop the onions up, get it in there, swirl it around, swivel it around,
[4602.22s -> 4607.05s]  put a little bit of oil in there, cook up the mushrooms and onions, get those cooked out to
[4607.05s -> 4611.13s]  perfection, make them nice and caramelized, put them over on the other side, put the steak in there,
[4613.58s -> 4624.12s]  two minutes, two minutes, put that on top, a little bit of A1, chop salad, chop it up.
[4627.38s -> 4632.89s]  I'm not weighing that. All right, you're distracting me.
[4633.13s -> 4652.02s]  Yeah, Derma A1, get it. Bang, I've been wanting to talk about this for like a week,
[4652.82s -> 4660.87s]  two, maybe three weeks. Guys, Five Guys is 100 times better than Shake Shack,
[4661.91s -> 4667.56s]  a hundred fucking times better. I don't know what happened, and I'm going to be really honest with
[4667.56s -> 4677.66s]  you, Five Guys fell off for me five years ago or so. Shake Shack was number one, best ever.
[4677.66s -> 4683.98s]  Number one, best ever. I'm telling you right now, Five Guys has improved in quality,
[4683.98s -> 4688.70s]  while Shake Shack has gone way fucking down in quality. Five Guys is now all the way up at
[4688.70s -> 4694.90s]  the top. They are number one for me. Seriously, I'm not kidding. I don't know what happened over the
[4694.90s -> 4702.87s]  last four or five years. Shake Shack, I have to be honest, this is just a review of that restaurant.
[4702.87s -> 4709.05s]  It sucks. It sucks now. What happened? Why? What happened? I don't know what happened.
[4709.77s -> 4717.98s]  I've had Shake Shack from more than one location, more than a few locations. It was kind of bad.
[4719.74s -> 4726.22s]  It really wasn't that... Okay, I got lettuce on a Shake Shack burger, and I'm not... I wish I took
[4726.22s -> 4732.38s]  a picture of it because it was fucking ridiculous. It was one tiny, wilted, small, thin piece of
[4732.38s -> 4741.62s]  wilted, wet, gross lettuce. I have to be honest with you. I went to Five Guys and I got lettuce,
[4741.62s -> 4747.56s]  and it was this crunchy, crispy, like... It was packed full of flavor and juices and stuff.
[4749.37s -> 4755.48s]  Oh my God, it was so good. And I used to think Shake Shack was the best. And I thought that Five
[4755.48s -> 4760.44s]  Guys was okay, but something happened in the last few years. It's probably the best takeout burger.
[4763.13s -> 4767.53s]  The tomato, if I were to have it, which I don't have it on my burgers, but if I did,
[4769.34s -> 4772.38s]  so crunchy and so just full of just juicy, delicious, fresh flavor.
[4774.70s -> 4791.56s]  They flipped. I just put it under the fucking bed. I don't care.
[4792.92s -> 4799.40s]  What do we do with these controllers? We have too many systems. What do these even go... Okay,
[4799.40s -> 4808.70s]  four is actually not a bad amount. Oh, we have two systems. Okay.
[4810.86s -> 4829.64s]  What is this? What are these things? What do I do with this record player?
[4831.08s -> 4844.36s]  Just keep... Everyone puts in my hair anyways. It's fine. But seriously, Five Guys, I don't know
[4844.36s -> 4866.60s]  what you did. The burgers are fucking on point. Better than anywhere else. Oh, not very much
[4866.60s -> 4879.64s]  storage. You know what I mean? Like, I don't... Where am I supposed to put this? There's way too
[4879.64s -> 4888.76s]  much stuff on the counter. Are you supposed to prepare food on this counter? You better be
[4888.76s -> 4892.28s]  throwing pizzas in the air because there's nothing... You're not going to have any room for anything.
[4956.38s -> 4962.58s]  I don't know what to do with that toothbrush. Let's go. Nail clipper. Let's go.
[4964.01s -> 5093.72s]  Shave and razor. Let's go. Mug. Hair gel. Febreze. Medicine. My god, what is all this? What the...
[5093.72s -> 5099.40s]  Rich streamer has never unpacked in his life. He gets his man servants to do it for him.
[5102.12s -> 5114.10s]  No, that's not accurate. That's not accurate. I just don't care about other people's stuff.
[5114.10s -> 5120.20s]  This is not my stuff. This is not my stuff, so I don't care. I don't care about your dumb green
[5120.20s -> 5124.20s]  toaster, all right? If this was my toaster, I would want to know where... I would want to
[5124.20s -> 5137.86s]  put it somewhere special. What's a razor doing in here? There's no room for anything. Where is
[5137.86s -> 5156.42s]  the Febreze supposed to go? Why is this so... Why is everything so wrong? There's no... There's no
[5156.42s -> 5165.32s]  where to put... I can't put anything anywhere. A Febreze goes in any room, okay? I don't understand.
[5165.32s -> 5169.96s]  This is stupid to me because considering... Like, how many times have you fought it in a room
[5170.76s -> 5176.86s]  and, holy shit, you hear somebody walking down the hallway, like, I don't know, your girlfriend,
[5177.82s -> 5183.90s]  like, you know, a few days ago, and you hear the footsteps and you just laid out a fucking gross
[5183.90s -> 5194.06s]  one. And if there was one in the bedroom right there... Done. It's for any room. It's literally
[5194.06s -> 5201.85s]  for any room. There's no room it has to be in. Oh, he fought it. Yeah, that's funny. Where does it
[5201.85s -> 5207.21s]  want me to put this? Does anybody have any idea where this... Where does it want this to go?
[5208.25s -> 5253.02s]  Where does it want this to go? I can't even put this anywhere. Why can't I leave it where it was?
[5253.02s -> 5274.33s]  I can't put it anywhere. What do I do with this? This is a laptop. How is this place worse than
[5274.33s -> 5288.49s]  the last one? There's less room than the last one. Where's it supposed to go? What am I supposed...
[5288.49s -> 5298.55s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do with this? Are you missing another room? I don't think so. The
[5298.55s -> 5308.34s]  side table? Well, that makes sense, okay. But what about the Etch A Sketch? I would think, like,
[5308.34s -> 5330.70s]  right here, right? No. I don't even have a desk. I don't have a desk. I've got plenty of fucking
[5330.70s -> 5420.07s]  underwear. Where's the desk? Throw it into the river. Piece of shit. This one's good. We're good.
[5420.07s -> 5423.91s]  What am I supposed... I don't understand what it wants me to do with these. They can't go anywhere.
[5423.91s -> 5489.05s]  I can't put them up anywhere. How is this not on the right spot? Why? On the coffee table in the
[5489.05s -> 5498.25s]  living room? That's kind of in the way. That takes up a... That's in the way, right? Am I crazy?
[5520.90s -> 5551.19s]  Fuck. I don't care. What's wrong with these? Okay, that looks all right. All the weird...
[5552.07s -> 5559.48s]  I would put them over here in a place to store them. I think that's good. All right, now we just
[5559.48s -> 5582.17s]  need to fix the bedroom. Right. My degree, which I don't know where it wants me to put it. Under the
[5582.17s -> 5635.43s]  bed. Under the bed? Is it supposed to be sad? I was just picking it up and putting it down for,
[5635.43s -> 5682.73s]  like, a fucking full five minutes. Jesus. I'm just angry. I feel so serious moving into his
[5682.73s -> 5732.09s]  place. All right, so now what? 2012. What's this? What am I doing here? One pound weights.
[5732.25s -> 5761.29s]  Oh, we got a DS? No, we don't have just a Game Boy Advance DS. I can stay here, I think. On the bed,
[5761.29s -> 5834.94s]  maybe. There it is. I'm putting the degree back up. What is this? These cartridges? That's better.
[5835.74s -> 5883.03s]  What is that? Why do you look so scary? I don't know, man. The light is on me.
[5883.75s -> 5926.76s]  Medkit. All right. Okay. He looks a bit scary. What the fuck are you talking about?
[5927.48s -> 5952.49s]  What are you talking about? I'm just sitting here. Yo, he does look a bit scary. All right,
[5952.49s -> 5990.01s]  that was a quick one. What's wrong with my eyes? What's wrong with this? Why do I have to take this
[5990.01s -> 6019.51s]  off? Throw it away. That's a way, right? Oh, I got it. Don't piss him off, guys. He'll yell again.
[6019.51s -> 6047.50s]  I'm not going to yell. This room used to feel bigger. Game's not even hard. Give me a fucking
[6047.50s -> 6072.63s]  challenge. 2013. That's a big one. All right, how fast do you think I can do it? You know,
[6072.63s -> 6078.49s]  I was just told if you really want to make moving around and opening boxes and putting stuff on
[6078.49s -> 6173.99s]  shelves and stuff, do it to a song. Isn't it fun? Okay, so I got everything out of the boxes. You
[6173.99s -> 6194.87s]  can do the rest. I'll be back. Why is there a cane? Am I old? All right, let me rethink this,
[6194.87s -> 6220.17s]  because obviously that was just, wow, laughing out fucking loud. I've always put these things
[6220.17s -> 6238.12s]  at the highest possible level. All the video games going on the bottom shelf. It's just easier
[6238.12s -> 6263.70s]  to keep track of. Any more stray video games? Yep. Perfect. Oh, I want the chickens in the bedroom.
[6263.70s -> 6286.98s]  Was it a DVD player? Yep. Sort them by console. No, you sort them by time played. Not by console,
[6286.98s -> 6291.40s]  but there's a bug in here. Where is it? That was weird. No, it wasn't. It was a floating piece
[6291.40s -> 6298.02s]  of dust. That was fucking terrifying. It just swooped into my... That was weird. It's by time
[6298.02s -> 6326.66s]  played. On what game? I'm sorry. That's the way it is. I don't know what that is. Okay. Frog.
[6327.30s -> 6341.61s]  You can sit over here. I want the chickens in the bedroom. What's the fastest way to get them over
[6341.61s -> 6368.54s]  there? This is gonna look really stupid when we see the fast motion one. The ukulele has a stand?
[6371.74s -> 6377.34s]  Where? That's a ukulele stand? I thought that was just like a piece of woodworking. I didn't
[6377.34s -> 6384.14s]  think it actually had a purpose. I thought that was just a piece of art. I didn't know that it
[6384.14s -> 6404.25s]  actually had a purpose. Okay, it does. Not bad. Oh, no. No, thanks. I'll do the computer room.
[6404.25s -> 6436.71s]  There's gonna be so many books. There's gonna be so many books. I'm not just talking about these.
[6436.71s -> 6471.06s]  I'm talking about these two. I'm talking about just all the books. What's that? Blanket. Laptop.
[6475.30s -> 6533.56s]  Tablet. Book. Book. Book. Book. Whale. Two whales. What the fuck? You have so many of these.
[6534.44s -> 6560.90s]  I'm a fax machine? Cods. Wi-Fi router. Clock. All right, let's organize this, please.
[6577.59s -> 6592.73s]  I don't know. I don't even know what these are. What is this? What is this thing? That's a scanner
[6592.73s -> 6600.55s]  and printer. What is this? Printer and scanner? So I have a scanner-printer combo and then a printer-
[6600.55s -> 6608.55s]  scanner combo. Why are they detached? What year is this supposed to be? They were connected always
[6608.55s -> 6620.31s]  for like the last 10 years. Printer-scanner combos existed since like 2005.
[6624.46s -> 6628.30s]  One is the scanner, one is the printer. Well, printer-scanner combos were- yeah,
[6628.30s -> 6640.54s]  they existed in 2013. Yes, they did. Yes, they did. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, they did.
[6640.54s -> 6752.31s]  La, la, la, la. Those individual cookies? Oh, they're coasters. All right. Oh, a curveball.
[6752.31s -> 6821.54s]  One of the reasons why I just- I know that, oh, you have a bunch of spices in your spice rack.
[6822.10s -> 6830.09s]  I kind of just want to consolidate them all into one bottle. Does that make sense? Just combine
[6830.09s -> 6833.61s]  half the spices I have into one fucking bottle because it's all going on anyways.
[6834.17s -> 6913.59s]  Come on, I can fit the strainer in here. How does it not fit in there? You can't be serious, right?
[6914.62s -> 6921.53s]  Oh, shut up. Stop. No, stop it. What are you doing? What are you doing in my wellington? Stop it.
[6923.88s -> 6967.46s]  Stop. What are you doing? I'll figure it out later, whatever. That's good. Do you drink oil? No,
[6967.46s -> 6992.87s]  I put olive oil in a lot of foods though. That's really good. Don't say that. You can only microwave
[6992.87s -> 7052.39s]  ramen noodles? That's not even true, man. So there it is finally. It only took like two hours to get
[7052.39s -> 7138.14s]  to the scale. What the hell is that? It's a linen ball. What is this? Oh, okay. What is this? This
[7138.14s -> 7153.69s]  looks all right. All right. This is going to be fun to wear. Little books. I'm just putting the
[7153.69s -> 7160.89s]  books right here. I'm going to put every book over there and I'll figure it out later. All shirts,
[7160.89s -> 7194.47s]  all pants are going over here. Whatever the hell this thing is. Okay. I love how seriously he's
[7194.47s -> 7205.02s]  taking this. Yeah, I am. I mean, I'm taking it dead seriously. All right. Get the other box open.
[7205.02s -> 7281.91s]  I got to make sure I get this right. I don't want to screw this up. Candle. Put the hangers up.
[7281.91s -> 7292.09s]  I'm concentrating. There's just no order here. That doesn't have to be. I operate in chaos.
[7329.91s -> 7360.62s]  What happened? Nothing. Is there another bedroom? No. Okay. Some of this shit's wrong. I wanted to
[7360.62s -> 7374.55s]  get the Wi-Fi router out of the way. How's that wrong? The microwave can't be over here.
[7374.55s -> 7379.83s]  So where else is it supposed to go? Where would you want me to put the microwave here?
[7379.83s -> 7386.14s]  There's no room for it. How is this supposed to go anywhere? Now where's the toaster go?
[7387.02s -> 7437.14s]  Where's the toaster supposed to go now? How is it wrong? It's a fucking towel. This is right.
[7437.14s -> 7465.46s]  What's wrong here? This bedroom has something wrong. Oh, book. Got it. I thought this was
[7465.46s -> 7501.67s]  the Sims for one second. That looks good. This hurt my neck. This game's really fun.
[7501.67s -> 7505.29s]  There's something about it. I don't know. I'm not really talking that much, but I'm just kind of
[7506.09s -> 7520.44s]  having a good time. I'm just enjoying it. You manipulated too much. Not really. Maybe a little.
[7522.06s -> 7557.88s]  2015. Now what? What? Is this the same place? Oh, these are cute. Those are cute.
[7560.17s -> 7575.48s]  Those are coasters. I want those. Those are cute. They actually really are. They don't
[7576.28s -> 7636.30s]  don't act like you don't think it is. I love these. I really do. Get them some fruit coasters.
[7636.30s -> 7642.06s]  I would love them. I'm probably going to get them. I'm probably going to go get the fruit coasters
[7642.06s -> 7658.94s]  wherever I can get them. These are comfy. This is comfy. I like this. What are these little games?
[7658.94s -> 7685.16s]  I got no room for these. Whoa. Book. Book. Book. I don't care. I don't read. I really don't.
[7685.80s -> 7691.16s]  Does the living room door just go to the outside? Yeah, I think it's an apartment.
[7699.05s -> 7709.21s]  This is done. All my shit is here. Oh, wait. I'm adding more. I understand now. I was like,
[7709.21s -> 7769.66s]  wait, what the hell am I doing? I get it. I'm just mixing up all the clothes.
[7770.46s -> 7775.10s]  I'm mixing up all of the clothes. I'm just putting them in random places. I'm not even...
[7776.76s -> 7830.79s]  Whatever. What is that? Are these walkie talkies? What do I do with this? What is that? All right,
[7830.79s -> 7845.34s]  close all this up. I can't see. Where do I put this? There's not enough room in the closet to
[7845.34s -> 7865.90s]  put this. These have to go into the bed or something. Have you filed as a furry for tax
[7865.90s -> 7911.03s]  purposes? I think you... Okay, this looks all right. Kitchen needs a little bit more stuff.
[7911.03s -> 7917.18s]  Put this up on the sill. All right, this is where it gets... It's going to get hard here.
[7917.18s -> 7937.51s]  It actually is. Cups out. A gigantic cheese grater? I don't... What is this? What is this?
[7939.51s -> 7944.54s]  What is that? A juicer? We don't need a juicer. We don't need one of these.
[7945.50s -> 7991.27s]  Ice cream scoop. That's a great addition, actually. Okay, these go this top. I mean,
[7991.35s -> 7999.98s]  that has to... I don't... Put this. What do I do with this? There's no counter space.
[8000.70s -> 8023.02s]  There's no space to put anything. All right, it's gonna have to do for now. I'll figure it out later.
[8040.71s -> 8045.51s]  There's not enough room. We don't have enough room. There's not enough room for all this.
[8046.62s -> 8053.93s]  I don't have enough room for all these salves. These gels. I don't have enough room for them.
[8056.76s -> 8091.38s]  This is too... I don't have enough space. Okay, towels can go over here. Bath mat. Look at this
[8091.38s -> 8112.57s]  countertop. This countertop is a mess. Oh, man. Wait, do we have... Are we gonna be on the walkie
[8112.57s -> 8136.89s]  talkies next to each other? What are the walkie talkies for? It's cute. It's fun. What is this
[8136.89s -> 8184.60s]  thing? I don't know what it wants me to do with that. What? What? Plants. What do I put this?
[8185.24s -> 8207.34s]  You know what's gonna... I'm gonna knock this over. If this is on my bedside, I'm gonna have a bottle
[8207.34s -> 8211.74s]  of water or something here and I'm gonna go reach to get the bottle of water and it's gonna annoy me
[8211.74s -> 8224.78s]  and I'm gonna knock the plant over. All right, what do I do with this thing? Can this fit in here
[8224.78s -> 8245.14s]  anywhere? There we go. I can't just go on the bed. There's a book in here. Get this book out of here.
[8256.54s -> 8274.25s]  Oh my god. What the fuck? There's so much shit in this room. If I abuse this desk, I'm gonna have a
[8274.25s -> 8296.09s]  fucking heart attack. Look at this. I can't even move. I can't exist in this room. Okay, got it.
[8297.34s -> 8330.76s]  Kitchen. Where do I put this? I am like throwing this across. I'm throwing this in the trash from
[8330.76s -> 8371.29s]  across the room right now. What do you don't like about this? I got it. The wooden thing? Is it a
[8371.29s -> 8376.25s]  relaxing game? Ah, it is. This is kind of... This is a little shitty. This was not a good one, I will
[8376.25s -> 8395.35s]  say. This wasn't a great one. If my nine-year-old sister was playing this yesterday, she was doing
[8395.35s -> 8458.60s]  better than you. How long did it take her to place one object? 2018. This place is huge. Nice. Nice.
[8459.59s -> 8481.78s]  Nice. First try. I'm getting this absolutely first try. Look at that placement already. We're good.
[8481.78s -> 8501.99s]  Let's take this up to the bathroom. Bingo. Check it out. Hand sanitizer. A bowl of fruit. Another
[8501.99s -> 8538.73s]  towel. Easy. Done deal. All right, this is a books. I'm gonna decorate up here. Okay, looks good.
[8538.73s -> 8609.94s]  I mean, put the baby toys in the baby bed, right? Some cream. Looks good. The ba- what? It might be
[8609.94s -> 8617.80s]  a little excessive, I agree. But I'm just barely... I'm barely... I'm barely functioning. I'm just
[8618.20s -> 8623.93s]  figuring it out. I'm getting it all in the same spot so I know where to put it. And this is not
[8623.93s -> 8688.54s]  going to be the end result. Okay, where should I put this? Look at all this baby stuff. I'm realizing
[8688.54s -> 8694.60s]  what happened. And I'm a little embarrassed, but whatever. I'm putting the clothes on the bookshelf
[8694.60s -> 8705.22s]  and the books on the clothes rack. This is what... I don't care. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
[8705.22s -> 8714.14s]  It's fine. Too many plants. I- no, too many- there are too many plants. There are way too many
[8714.14s -> 8781.72s]  plants. I'm just gonna be honest with you. Do you have too many plants? What? I fucking hate this
[8781.72s -> 8792.23s]  box. This box has been a pain in the ass at every single level. I hate this thing. I- I- I- I- I
[8792.23s -> 8797.86s]  can't- I don't know where to put it ever. I hate this box. I don't want- yeah, I don't want this
[8797.86s -> 8824.52s]  fishing tackle box. I- I don't- it's annoying to use. Somehow we're getting more chickens.
[8825.24s -> 8843.93s]  How do they keep increasing? They keep increasing. Man, I- this makes me anxiety. I hate this.
[8845.42s -> 8851.42s]  I don't do- I can't do clothes thing. Big closet or something. No, no, no. I just have five Star
[8851.42s -> 8859.86s]  War shirts, four pairs of jeans, a suit, and a bunch of fucking cartoon shirts. I can't do this.
[8860.50s -> 8879.61s]  I have- I mean, well, let me look at it. This is- this is like a nice shirt. This is fine.
[8879.61s -> 8893.90s]  It's a nice bean. I have got five of these, six of these. I got like seven or eight pairs of jeans.
[8894.62s -> 8915.05s]  Different colors. Some slacks. You're speaking gibberish? What do you mean? What? Man, I gotta
[8915.05s -> 8990.74s]  get some of these boxes out of the fucking way. Get up there. Huh? Why can I hang these? I was
[8990.74s -> 9040.06s]  gonna put the pants on the bottom and the shirts on top. I don't care anymore. It's such a mess.
[9040.86s -> 9044.25s]  It just- all their clothes are all over the place. They don't even color
[9044.25s -> 9062.44s]  coordinate or anything. It's such a mess. I'm not a designer. I'm not a designer, all right?
[9063.16s -> 9075.99s]  You're just lazy? I'm not- I'm not lazy. I don't know- I don't know where things are supposed to
[9075.99s -> 9087.05s]  go in a big walk-in closet. I just- underwear goes in the underwear slot, shirts go in the shirt
[9087.13s -> 9095.50s]  slot, pants go wherever you want. Anywhere. At the end of the day, as long as you just kind of know
[9095.50s -> 9100.22s]  where your clothes are, does it really matter that much? As long as you know where your stuff is.
[9101.02s -> 9126.38s]  And it's not a mess if it was clean in here. Of course there's a fucking book in here.
[9128.41s -> 9135.02s]  Of course there's- of course there's a goddamn book in there. They have so many books that- that's
[9135.10s -> 9145.83s]  in the bathroom boxes. It's in the clothes boxes. You have too many books. All right, where was I?
[9149.10s -> 9197.43s]  Oh shit, that was bad. Was that cookie tin? I don't think- I think it's a sewing kit.
[9197.43s -> 9211.62s]  I think this is a sewing kit. Yeah, this is definitely for sewing. Oh shit. Hiding something
[9211.62s -> 9266.89s]  here. This all can't fit over there. All right, bathroom time. I thought that was a wishbone.
[9267.45s -> 9281.66s]  One of those sinks. One of the sinks that has the- the laminor flow. This is definitely one
[9281.66s -> 9298.25s]  of those sinks. I love it. How do you say it? Yeah, laminar. Laminar flow, yeah. I learned.
[9298.25s -> 9316.84s]  I paid attention last time you talked. I heard what you said. I don't want this thing, but I'll
[9316.84s -> 9439.02s]  put it over here. Oh, that's cute. Yeah, these are cool. Oh, look. Oh, look. Oh, look. Oh, look. Oh,
[9439.02s -> 9462.49s]  look. More of the same- how many copies of this book do you need? How many copies of this book
[9462.49s -> 9491.10s]  do you have? That's a lot. That's a lot of copies of the same book. It's a published book.
[9491.74s -> 9579.59s]  Let's go. Let's go. There's so much shit on this desk. Hey. Hey, look. All right, living room time.
[9579.59s -> 9583.11s]  Observation, humor, Andy. I feel like I haven't talked in like an hour.
[9606.94s -> 9611.18s]  Wii motes always go on top in front of the TV. They never go inside of any storage. They're always
[9611.18s -> 9614.62s]  in front of the TV, so you're ready to game. Anyone that comes in your house always knows
[9614.62s -> 9622.95s]  you're ready for the Wii. The Wii motes on top of a certain visible area is a prop. It's a set for
[9622.95s -> 9633.58s]  your house. It's a way to start a conversation. It's a way to get gaming immediately. These are
[9633.58s -> 9698.09s]  not out of the way. They're there by very much by design. What is that? This goes in the kitchen,
[9698.09s -> 9751.48s]  right? I need the- anything that holds that. Oh, my favorite part. I'm fixing it. I know people
[9751.48s -> 9755.16s]  are freaking out right now. They're in the wrong spot. They're in the wrong spot. I got it under
[9755.16s -> 9771.93s]  control. And next person that says wrong spot, Andy, would hate to be you. It's called the timeout.
[9799.26s -> 9825.51s]  So many games. We have a shitload of games. Oh, my goodness. I don't have enough room for any of
[9825.51s -> 9857.53s]  this stuff. Um, the cane. Where do I put the cane? Figure it out later. You look a little pale.
[9857.53s -> 9869.11s]  Probably the white balance. I got a big bright ass light in my face. I can't see. I got to get
[9869.11s -> 9888.18s]  these two boxes out of here. Glassware up here. Bulbware up here. Just- I need to get the boxes
[9888.18s -> 9924.97s]  out of the way. Like, I can't see without moving it. Okay, now I can see. Let's get some stuff
[9924.97s -> 9953.45s]  situated. Okay, shit. All right, move this out of the way. We'll put these here. These all go
[9953.45s -> 9970.26s]  together. All right, I'm gonna put these up here. This gets the toy truck out of the way. Uh, this
[9970.26s -> 9976.26s]  is like a serving tray, whatever. All right, I need to- spices and sweets need to go up here.
[9976.82s -> 10001.56s]  Spices and sweets go up there. Coffee's gonna go up top. Freaking out. Why? Why? What do you- what
[10001.56s -> 10018.17s]  do you mean? Why are you freaking out? Go- go- go to the- I'm- I'm fine. I don't have to go to the
[10018.17s -> 10049.67s]  bathroom. I'm fine. What are you talking about? Ooh, that's helpful. You mean in the game. Oh,
[10049.67s -> 10099.54s]  okay. Towel. Cheese grater. Poster. Trash bags. Idiot. This looks like- looks like a
[10099.54s -> 10171.82s]  fucking kitty litter thing. I'm sorry. Freaking. Freaking. What are the utensils? Oven mitts.
[10174.84s -> 10231.69s]  Another tray. Nice. Go piss. I don't need to pee. Stop. That can't fit up here. The rolling pin
[10231.69s -> 10298.18s]  needs to be able to fit in here somewhere, right? Okay, there we go. Ah, utensils. Fuck. I can move
[10298.18s -> 10306.22s]  with that. I can move with that so I can talk. Just slow down and say what you want to say.
[10306.22s -> 10333.08s]  I can move all that stuff up here in a minute. Okay, let's do it. Salt. Uh, paprika. Keep the,
[10334.04s -> 10395.26s]  where's our shower? Why is the microwave next to- you just hurt my chest. There's nowhere else
[10395.26s -> 10478.87s]  for it to go. Books. What is this? Oh, just getting it out. Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.
[10478.87s -> 10542.39s]  Why is there a toaster in here? Um, guys, where am I supposed to put this? Move. What is this
[10542.39s -> 10562.28s]  even doing in here? I'm setting the table. You catch the game last night? What's your favorite
[10562.28s -> 10572.58s]  subject in school? Do you like hot fudge sundaes? Somebody just said did I catch the game last night
[10572.58s -> 10592.62s]  and it freaked me out. That looks nice. I don't want, I don't want to put this in here. Okay.
[10593.42s -> 10600.82s]  What's, what remains? Oh, there's an upstairs. Oh shit. Okay, so we do have a bathroom up here.
[10601.77s -> 10647.48s]  I forgot. Why did I not finish this? Tissues. Eh. Okay. Am I almost done with the game?
[10648.12s -> 10683.27s]  When does the game end? Oh, this is the last level. Oh shit. All right. Laundry. Okay. Okay.
[10683.27s -> 10719.16s]  Okay. What do we do with this towel? Whoa, there's a whole nother place to put stuff.
[10719.16s -> 10786.38s]  Okay. Oops. Fuck. It's a bath mat. So what? Oh, right. What is this bag of dog food?
[10786.38s -> 10802.79s]  What is this? I don't know what it is. Actually, I really don't know. This is soil. Why would there
[10802.79s -> 10837.51s]  be a bag of soil in the laundry room? It's a bag of dirt. Okay. This has got to come with me.
[10840.31s -> 10848.98s]  I just got to cut the other bathroom. It's got to come with me. Now what's the problem?
[10848.98s -> 10875.86s]  Okay. It's very unhappy with this. Why? The coffee can be there. What's wrong with the coffee being
[10875.86s -> 10908.23s]  up there? Bro, where else am I supposed to put this stuff? Bro, I think that's good. Apparently,
[10908.23s -> 10930.33s]  the scanner can't go here. So the scanner is going to the office. Problem solved. Problem solved.
[10930.33s -> 10953.10s]  I have to fix this, don't I? I can't believe I did that. I need to, I need some protein or something.
[10953.10s -> 10956.46s]  I need to eat like a bag of peanuts. I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[10957.51s -> 10972.26s]  I actually don't know what the heck I was doing. Okay. There's all kinds of problems.
[10972.26s -> 10992.25s]  Look at all these problems. Plant. All right. What am I missing here? This is in the wrong spot.
[10992.25s -> 11004.86s]  Not anymore. Nope. Okay. That's in the wrong spot too. What am I going to do about this?
[11007.06s -> 11038.63s]  This bag doesn't fit. Yes. Towel and that's it. Let's go. Just put an extra towel somewhere.
[11039.19s -> 11049.45s]  Just a fresh towel somewhere. What do I do with this? I don't. What do I do with this towel?
[11049.45s -> 11068.92s]  I can't go in the baby room. Where is this supposed to go? Thanks. I appreciate the help
[11068.92s -> 11075.24s]  when you say up my butt. Thank you. Thanks. But like I'm looking for a practical answer.
[11075.24s -> 11088.92s]  Where is this supposed to go? Under the sink? How am I supposed to put this under the sink?
[11094.22s -> 11098.46s]  Oh, I don't know, dude. Maybe like up your butt. Try up your ass. Oh, okay.
[11101.51s -> 11106.95s]  This is an extra towel. I don't need this. This is an extra towel.
[11107.67s -> 11122.55s]  I don't need this extra towel. Dude, this can't go anywhere.
[11129.19s -> 11195.96s]  Now where does this piece of shit go? I just go. This dude is cracked. Oh no, sorry. I'm going to
[11195.96s -> 11217.50s]  go and they all do it for me. There's a lot. Take another bong rip. No, I'm good. I'm good.
[11217.50s -> 11231.08s]  I think I'm good. I like this a lot. This is really fun. There's one thing I would change in
[11231.08s -> 11239.66s]  this game and that's to be able to be allowed to have stuff in the wrong place. It's the only
[11239.66s -> 11245.38s]  complaint I have. It's this very solid fun game though. I thought it was good. That was great.
[11246.34s -> 11253.43s]  There's a setting where you could do that. Oh, cool. That was a good time.
[11261.11s -> 11261.91s]  Let's get a song.
[11261.91s -> 11268.76s]  Knock on the door. Now all your stuff is here in boxes on the floor.
[11269.56s -> 11277.64s]  You open up. There is so much to do. I open up my heart. Did you understand the plot?
[11279.64s -> 11283.66s]  I think a little. Yeah.
[11295.80s -> 11297.00s]  Three games finished in one day.
[11297.00s -> 11301.72s]  You can't count Freddy fish. That doesn't work.
[11309.14s -> 11320.22s]  I do look kind of pale, don't I? It's because of the lighting here.
[11322.22s -> 11327.46s]  Auto balance. I kind of look a little blurry.
[11330.34s -> 11340.73s]  I just moved it over to look at it. That was a lot of fun.
[11341.69s -> 11346.01s]  That's a good place to end it. Six and a half hours about.
[11346.81s -> 11352.89s]  Freddy fish was fun. This game was fun. Good hanging out with you.
[11364.87s -> 11373.08s]  Yeah, have a good time. I had a great time. Yes, have a good time. Yes, I have a good time.
[11373.72s -> 11385.10s]  I had a great time. Next time you're going to see me will be Wednesday.
[11386.87s -> 11390.95s]  See you guys on Wednesday around the same time, between 2 and 2.30 ish.
[11391.83s -> 11409.43s]  I say 2, I know, but it really means 2.20. Great, I'll see you Thursday or Friday. Nope,
[11409.43s -> 11417.18s]  it's going to be Wednesday. I got a lot of stuff to do this weekend.
[11419.10s -> 11423.98s]  There are many, many things that my brain is going to be spread out into five or six places.
[11424.94s -> 11428.54s]  So I'm going to have to take the time this weekend to situate them all.
[11429.26s -> 11437.37s]  Yeah, see you Wednesday, two o'clock. I don't know. I have no idea what we're going to play.
[11440.17s -> 11451.40s]  It'll be something cool, though. I hope. All right, guys, let's run the credits going.
[11452.12s -> 11468.82s]  This music is going to stay on. That's fine. What is the oh, never mind.
[11469.54s -> 11476.42s]  I enjoyed the music. They would know the game is great. That's really chill.
[11479.90s -> 11487.32s]  It was a good chill time. What should I do on Wednesday, though? That's a real good question.
[11496.20s -> 11505.38s]  Cruelty Squad? I don't know. I feel like playing Ultra Kill drained me of two straight weeks of
[11505.38s -> 11515.93s]  video game playing. I can do Dread X. Don't you feel like you want to have Dread X be for a weekend,
[11515.93s -> 11521.93s]  though? And which one should I play? Because there's four or five different compilations.
[11521.93s -> 11539.48s]  Which one's a good one? Just start at the beginning. Vampire Survivor. We'll figure it out.
[11540.28s -> 11549.85s]  They're all good. Each could be its own stream. Really? OK, I'll look into that. Maybe we'll do
[11549.85s -> 11556.02s]  that on Wednesday. Maybe we'll play the first one. Unless we can get some ideas. I can go look at
[11556.02s -> 11567.64s]  the recommended two. All right, guys. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves. Thanks for
[11567.64s -> 11640.57s]  watching. Call your mother. Have a great night. We'll see you again soon. Take care.
